1
00:00:19,954 --> 00:00:25,187
<i>- No. Stop.
- You silly fucking twit.</i>

2
00:00:25,187 --> 00:00:29,515
<i>You are one stupid fucking bitch,
you know that.</i>

3
00:00:29,515 --> 00:00:33,008
<i>Shut the fuck up.
No.</i>

4
00:00:36,872 --> 00:00:38,727
<i>There you are.</i>

5
00:00:39,868 --> 00:00:40,708
No! No.

6
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:46,691
You little shit.

7
00:00:46,691 --> 00:00:47,441
No!

8
00:00:50,100 --> 00:01:06,100

9
00:01:40,685 --> 00:01:42,113
<i>Anastasia Steele?</i>

10
00:01:46,224 --> 00:01:48,203
Thanks.

11
00:02:45,374 --> 00:02:47,350
Yeah, got it.

12
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:50,923
- Good morning, Mr Hyde.
- Anna, please, just Jack.

13
00:02:50,923 --> 00:02:53,608
Tea right?
Weak, black.

14
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:58,696
I'm supposed to get this
for you but Thank you! Jack.

15
00:03:13,677 --> 00:03:20,120
Hi! This is amazing.
It's all coral and turtles and booze and..

16
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:23,083
You should be here.
Why aren't you here?

17
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:27,191
And tell that douchebag brother
of mine to take a day off for once.

18
00:03:27,191 --> 00:03:29,921
Alright, Bye Anna.
Bye..!

19
00:04:12,912 --> 00:04:16,520
This for me?
Nah, they can wait.

20
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:19,791
Okay. Look nice.
Going out tonight?

21
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:24,672
A friend of mine has a photography
exhibition opening tonight.

22
00:04:24,672 --> 00:04:27,772
So, can I go?
Good.

23
00:04:27,772 --> 00:04:31,955
How did you make out with those
manuscripts? Oh, really great actually.

24
00:04:31,955 --> 00:04:35,490
...This one, um..
Voice Fox.

25
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:37,589
...I coudn't put it down.

26
00:04:37,589 --> 00:04:42,477
It's so sharp and relevant and
I think it's really got something.

27
00:04:42,477 --> 00:04:44,905
- You think?
- Yeah.

28
00:04:44,905 --> 00:04:47,460
- Alright, I'll check it out.
- Great.

29
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:50,444
- Have fun tonight Anna...thank You.
- Thanks for today.

30
00:04:52,358 --> 00:04:55,378
- Goodnight Hanna.
- Bye.

31
00:05:12,126 --> 00:05:13,289
Thanks.

32
00:05:29,341 --> 00:05:31,009
Oh my God.

33
00:05:32,144 --> 00:05:34,517
Jesus Christ.

34
00:05:42,153 --> 00:05:45,621
Anna!
You made it.

35
00:05:46,146 --> 00:05:51,338
Jose.
It's like, so much of my face in here.

36
00:05:51,338 --> 00:05:54,668
If I had asked,
You'd been like I'm too shy.

37
00:05:54,668 --> 00:05:58,052
Yeah.
But you...

38
00:05:59,182 --> 00:06:02,380
- Is my best stuff.
- That's... um...

39
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:07,304
- Do you like them?
- They are super...

40
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:09,461
Large.

41
00:06:10,559 --> 00:06:15,003
All portraits were sold to one man.

42
00:06:16,202 --> 00:06:18,380
You're kidding.

43
00:06:20,157 --> 00:06:23,786
Well, somebody likes them.

44
00:06:24,111 --> 00:06:27,234
They just bought all six.

45
00:06:27,234 --> 00:06:30,105
- All six?
- Dinner's on me tonight, Okay?

46
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:32,930
I'll be right back.

47
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,387
Anastasia.

48
00:07:10,481 --> 00:07:13,588
It was you. Wasn't it?
You just went and buy all of this?

49
00:07:14,607 --> 00:07:17,777
I don't like strangers
talking at you.

50
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:21,797
Why are you here?

51
00:07:22,265 --> 00:07:24,117
For you.

52
00:07:25,162 --> 00:07:30,829
Hey. Can we talk somewhere...
Private?

53
00:07:30,829 --> 00:07:31,489
No.

54
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,966
Okay I'm not very good at this.
I've never had..

55
00:07:35,391 --> 00:07:37,705
Never wanted to try again.

56
00:07:40,241 --> 00:07:43,190
- Christian. I know, it's not a good idea.
- Let's talk.

57
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:45,790
Okay?
Just talk please.

58
00:07:46,843 --> 00:07:48,874
Have dinner with me.

59
00:07:54,719 --> 00:07:56,868
Okay, fine.
I'll have dinner with you.

60
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:04,110
Because I'm hungry, but we are
only talking. And that is it.

61
00:08:06,308 --> 00:08:10,180
- Would like some more time?
- Two steaks, medium fries.

62
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:11,278
Green vegetables.

63
00:08:11,608 --> 00:08:14,019
Actually I'm gonna
have a King more Salad.

64
00:08:15,678 --> 00:08:17,317
Fine..

65
00:08:17,543 --> 00:08:20,072
And two glasses of
Browseable Liquares.

66
00:08:20,072 --> 00:08:21,807
We only sell that by the bottle sir.

67
00:08:21,807 --> 00:08:24,103
- A bottle then.
- Yes Sir.

68
00:08:25,388 --> 00:08:27,118
Thanks.

69
00:08:27,828 --> 00:08:29,357
So...

70
00:08:29,357 --> 00:08:31,073
Let's talk.

71
00:08:36,248 --> 00:08:38,670
I want you back.

72
00:08:39,525 --> 00:08:42,148
I like to re-negotiate terms.

73
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:45,968
But I don't see how.

74
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:50,607
Of things you would said
That's the way you are.

75
00:08:50,607 --> 00:08:54,181
But what happened last time.
Is not gonna happen again.

76
00:08:54,181 --> 00:08:55,828
How can you say that?

77
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,570
I know that I asked you to,

78
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:03,356
...show me how far I can go but..

79
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:09,598
You aren't getting off on
the pain you inflicted.

80
00:09:12,869 --> 00:09:14,993
That's still in you.

81
00:09:14,993 --> 00:09:17,067
I'm working on it.

82
00:09:17,067 --> 00:09:20,179
Working on what?

83
00:09:22,376 --> 00:09:24,993
I can't do this if
you won't talk to me.

84
00:09:26,593 --> 00:09:29,356
- What do you wanna know?
- Everything.

85
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:32,084
Fine.

86
00:09:47,413 --> 00:09:49,063
Yo, we'll manage.

87
00:09:59,306 --> 00:10:01,376
My birth mother died
when I was four.

88
00:10:01,891 --> 00:10:04,626
She was an addict, crack.

89
00:10:05,425 --> 00:10:07,313
You could fill in the blanks.

90
00:10:08,154 --> 00:10:10,547
- Why didn't you tell me that?
- I did..

91
00:10:10,547 --> 00:10:13,925
But you were asleep at that time.

92
00:10:15,242 --> 00:10:19,202
Okay.
Well, umm..

93
00:10:19,202 --> 00:10:20,617
Generally...

94
00:10:21,468 --> 00:10:26,510
A key part of communication is
that both parties be conscious.

95
00:10:29,364 --> 00:10:33,079
I'm really sorry about your mother.

96
00:10:34,232 --> 00:10:36,905
It's in the past.

97
00:10:36,905 --> 00:10:41,221
Now,
I brought you here to negotiate.

98
00:10:41,834 --> 00:10:43,833
You are open to new terms?

99
00:10:46,361 --> 00:10:48,348
No rules.

100
00:10:49,217 --> 00:10:50,698
No punishments.

101
00:10:54,689 --> 00:11:00,143
No rules. No punishments.
And no more secrets.

102
00:11:01,238 --> 00:11:02,994
I can do that..

103
00:11:02,994 --> 00:11:06,234
You want a...
What do you call it?

104
00:11:06,706 --> 00:11:08,848
A vanilla relationship?

105
00:11:09,262 --> 00:11:11,519
I mean we only do what
you are comfortable with.

106
00:11:13,259 --> 00:11:15,257
But you need all these things.

107
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:19,142
I need you more.

108
00:11:26,363 --> 00:11:30,213
- Ms Steele.
- Thanks Taylor.

109
00:11:34,896 --> 00:11:38,699
No strings attached.

110
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:06,413
This is spiky.
I like it.

111
00:12:10,543 --> 00:12:16,756
- I'll call you tomorrow.
- Okay, good night.

112
00:12:58,209 --> 00:13:00,042
Anna!

113
00:13:00,042 --> 00:13:02,395
I've been hearing a lot of
good things about you. Oh.

114
00:13:02,395 --> 00:13:03,693
Told you Liz..

115
00:13:03,693 --> 00:13:06,556
- This one actually reads.
- Hey Jack.

116
00:13:06,556 --> 00:13:09,744
What's the head of HR doing lurking around?
Are we in trouble?

117
00:13:09,744 --> 00:13:12,667
Not at all,
I'm just here to encourage.

118
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:17,244
Really? Well, I think a round of
drinks at Lauries would do the trick.

119
00:13:17,647 --> 00:13:20,557
Sorry meetings, otherwise...

120
00:13:20,557 --> 00:13:24,364
- Who's Laurie?
- Oh it's a bar around the corner.

121
00:13:24,364 --> 00:13:26,544
Friday is a bit of a ritual.

122
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:31,732
You should come.
Absolutely, go network.

123
00:13:31,732 --> 00:13:35,309
No, I would..
I have plans tonight.

124
00:13:35,579 --> 00:13:39,336
So have your plan come along.
Just for a quick one.

125
00:13:39,783 --> 00:13:41,777
Hello?
Yeah..

126
00:13:45,437 --> 00:13:47,309
Have fun.

127
00:13:55,925 --> 00:14:00,583
- Anastasia.
- I'm sorry, have we met before?

128
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:02,715
It's okay.

129
00:14:03,268 --> 00:14:05,210
I am nobody.

130
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:09,938
Hey, Lauries is this way.
Come on, I'm buying.

131
00:14:15,317 --> 00:14:18,285
- Alright...Here we go.
- Thanks.

132
00:14:18,285 --> 00:14:19,770
Where is everyone?

133
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:21,744
You know..still early.

134
00:14:21,744 --> 00:14:25,672
Your comments on Voice
Fox were interesting.

135
00:14:25,672 --> 00:14:28,363
I'm not usually into
political thrillers.

136
00:14:28,363 --> 00:14:32,714
Yeah, well, I think they are parallels
with Dante's inferno were amazing but..

137
00:14:32,714 --> 00:14:35,996
Yeah, you convince me.
I'm reading.

138
00:14:35,996 --> 00:14:38,404
Oh. That's great.

139
00:14:38,404 --> 00:14:39,843
Hey.

140
00:14:39,843 --> 00:14:43,996
Hi, Christian this is Jack Hyde.

141
00:14:43,996 --> 00:14:49,135
I am her boyfriend.
I am the boss.

142
00:14:49,135 --> 00:14:52,766
- What will you have, Chris?
- Thanks, Jack.

143
00:14:53,123 --> 00:14:54,459
Another time.

144
00:14:57,497 --> 00:14:58,445
Thanks.

145
00:15:03,117 --> 00:15:04,059
Another time.

146
00:15:05,558 --> 00:15:08,181
I can't believe you just
talked to him like that.

147
00:15:08,181 --> 00:15:11,202
- He wants what is mine.
- What's yours?

148
00:15:11,202 --> 00:15:13,331
It's a little presumptuous.

149
00:15:14,319 --> 00:15:16,938
He is my boss, Christian,
You gotta calm down.

150
00:15:18,235 --> 00:15:20,771
Calm isn't really my forte.

151
00:15:22,401 --> 00:15:23,901
I know something that could help.

152
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:31,713
You know this is
not what in mind.

153
00:15:33,327 --> 00:15:36,124
When is the last time
you went shopping?

154
00:15:36,124 --> 00:15:37,692
Houston.
A week ago.

155
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:41,128
- What did you buy?
- An Airline.

156
00:15:45,507 --> 00:15:46,603
Here.

157
00:15:49,744 --> 00:15:51,213
Your new favorite flavor.

158
00:16:00,623 --> 00:16:02,147
Excuse me.

159
00:16:14,654 --> 00:16:16,174
Do you need a hand with that?

160
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:19,364
I'll manage.

161
00:16:24,837 --> 00:16:29,297
- I know what you're doing.
- What? I'm being a culinary mastermind.

162
00:16:29,297 --> 00:16:37,408
You only have to ask.
I think we should take it slow.

163
00:16:37,793 --> 00:16:41,540
- Okay.
- Ok... Okay.

164
00:16:44,713 --> 00:16:47,039
Tell me about SIP.

165
00:16:47,266 --> 00:16:51,494
- How is it going?
- It's good.

166
00:16:52,275 --> 00:16:55,738
Jack seems genuinely
interested in my opinion.

167
00:16:56,214 --> 00:16:57,439
What's moral like?

168
00:16:57,829 --> 00:17:00,054
Moral?
You mean like we all sitting in a circle

169
00:17:00,054 --> 00:17:02,260
and singing the company
song in the morning.

170
00:17:02,804 --> 00:17:05,761
That's just for well
managed to people happy.

171
00:17:06,406 --> 00:17:08,236
- Oh my God.
- What?

172
00:17:09,531 --> 00:17:11,217
You are buying SIP?

173
00:17:12,174 --> 00:17:14,270
No, you can't do that.
That's my job.

174
00:17:14,631 --> 00:17:16,783
You can't start
interfering in my career.

175
00:17:16,783 --> 00:17:18,709
It's not about that.

176
00:17:18,709 --> 00:17:22,384
I've wanted to move into publishing.
They're the best fit.

177
00:17:23,576 --> 00:17:25,579
But you're gonna be my boss.

178
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:28,154
Technically,
I'll be your bosses bosses' boss.

179
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:31,661
And I'm gonna be sleeping
with my bosses bosses' boss.

180
00:17:31,661 --> 00:17:33,525
Alright now, you're arguing with him.

181
00:17:33,525 --> 00:17:35,136
Yeah, because he's being an ass.

182
00:17:35,432 --> 00:17:36,776
An ass.
Really?

183
00:17:37,127 --> 00:17:38,870
Ass.

184
00:17:49,386 --> 00:17:51,226
You know that's off limits.

185
00:17:54,523 --> 00:17:56,441
I'm gonna need a road map.

186
00:18:18,505 --> 00:18:20,637
I thought you wanted to take it slow.

187
00:18:24,446 --> 00:18:26,502
What do you want Anastasia?

188
00:18:29,451 --> 00:18:31,494
Well to communicate
you have to tell me.

189
00:18:35,328 --> 00:18:37,522
I want you.

190
00:18:53,744 --> 00:18:55,064
I'm too dressed.

191
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:08,755
Keep going.

192
00:19:34,366 --> 00:19:35,691
Kiss me.

193
00:20:10,455 --> 00:20:14,231
What do you want Anastasia?

194
00:20:15,866 --> 00:20:18,290
I want all of you.

195
00:20:55,879 --> 00:20:58,202
For sex.

196
00:21:04,075 --> 00:21:08,486
I was reading
Austin and Bronte.

197
00:21:08,486 --> 00:21:10,913
Nobody ever
measure up to that.

198
00:21:12,834 --> 00:21:15,886
I guess I was waiting for
something exceptional.

199
00:21:18,522 --> 00:21:20,702
And then I met you.

200
00:21:24,164 --> 00:21:26,350
Will Miss Austin.

201
00:21:27,523 --> 00:21:29,484
Approve of this?

202
00:21:31,962 --> 00:21:33,371
I was being romantic.

203
00:21:33,371 --> 00:21:36,609
And then you just go and distract
me with your kinky fuckery.

204
00:21:36,992 --> 00:21:39,342
- Kinky Fuckery.
- Ah uhh!

205
00:21:39,342 --> 00:21:42,034
I don't know what that is.
But I like the sound of it.

206
00:22:20,389 --> 00:22:23,194
You look so peaceful
I didn't wanna wake you.

207
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:26,755
It's not much for breakfast.

208
00:22:27,117 --> 00:22:29,072
Unless you want cold stir-fry.

209
00:22:34,838 --> 00:22:38,054
Here. The check you gave me for
one day You should have it back.

210
00:22:38,054 --> 00:22:39,262
Keep it.

211
00:22:39,262 --> 00:22:41,480
Keep it?
It's 24 thousand dollars.

212
00:22:41,708 --> 00:22:43,158
Anna...

213
00:22:44,096 --> 00:22:46,004
I make that kind of money
every fifteen minutes...

214
00:22:46,004 --> 00:22:47,048
So keep it.

215
00:23:10,355 --> 00:23:12,522
Andrea, good morning.

216
00:23:13,431 --> 00:23:17,508
Could you please transfer $24,000 into
the account of Ms Anastasia Steele?

217
00:23:17,508 --> 00:23:18,762
No. What are
you doing?

218
00:23:19,581 --> 00:23:21,621
That's fine, Thank you.

219
00:23:23,626 --> 00:23:26,134
Why do you have my
bank account details?

220
00:23:26,944 --> 00:23:28,560
What's good for breakfast around here?

221
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:31,183
Christian, how do you
have my bank information?

222
00:23:36,337 --> 00:23:37,352
Thank you.

223
00:23:40,007 --> 00:23:42,096
Gotta be quicker
than that Grey.

224
00:23:45,937 --> 00:23:48,350
My parents are hosting
a charity ball tonight.

225
00:23:49,016 --> 00:23:52,301
I've promised I will make an appearance.
Want you to come with me.

226
00:23:55,015 --> 00:23:59,728
I've never been to a ball.
I don't have a dress for that.

227
00:23:59,728 --> 00:24:02,379
Also,
what am I gonna do with my hair?

228
00:24:02,379 --> 00:24:04,043
I know someone.

229
00:24:04,043 --> 00:24:06,845
And you don't need to
worry about the dress.

230
00:24:06,845 --> 00:24:08,895
It's all gonna be taken care of.

231
00:24:10,076 --> 00:24:11,624
What is it?

232
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:17,823
There was just a girl over there and
she was outside my office yesterday.

233
00:24:17,823 --> 00:24:19,401
And she knew my name...

234
00:24:19,401 --> 00:24:23,281
and she had a bandage on her wrist,
it was really strange.

235
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:27,742
We should go.

236
00:24:41,518 --> 00:24:44,765
- Hey, how you doing?
- Good okay!

237
00:24:57,556 --> 00:25:01,133
Hey, how you doing?

238
00:25:28,803 --> 00:25:34,153
- Anna!
- Is that Mrs. Robinson?

239
00:25:35,628 --> 00:25:36,682
Her name is Elena Lincoln.

240
00:25:36,682 --> 00:25:40,550
I don't care what her name is Christian.
Why would you take me there?

241
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:43,679
Why would you take me to meet the
woman who seduced and abused you?

242
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:47,256
Our relationship ended years ago,
we're just friends.

243
00:25:47,256 --> 00:25:51,253
- And business partners.
- Business partners? Are you kidding me?

244
00:25:51,917 --> 00:25:56,397
Would you take your subs there?

245
00:25:57,204 --> 00:26:00,637
Oh my god, for what?
Her approval? What is this?

246
00:26:00,637 --> 00:26:02,877
No. It's not
like that.

247
00:26:02,877 --> 00:26:06,353
That girl I saw this morning
was one of them, wasn't she?

248
00:26:06,353 --> 00:26:09,454
Let's discuss this back in my place,
I can have someone come by, do your hair.

249
00:26:09,454 --> 00:26:12,462
Christian, I don't care about my hair.
Explain to me, what's going on?

250
00:26:12,462 --> 00:26:15,208
I'll explain when we are there.
Come on.

251
00:26:16,087 --> 00:26:18,261
Ok,
you either walk or I can carry you.

252
00:26:18,261 --> 00:26:20,587
- You wouldn't do that.
- No it's your choice.

253
00:26:22,927 --> 00:26:25,165
Okay, fine fine..
I'll walk.

254
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:32,721
Her name is Leila Williams.

255
00:26:32,721 --> 00:26:35,351
She's my sub for a
while about 2 years ago.

256
00:26:35,351 --> 00:26:38,047
What happened to her?

257
00:26:38,047 --> 00:26:42,741
She wanted more.
I didn't. So I ended it.

258
00:26:43,891 --> 00:26:46,654
She left, got married,
I thought she moved on.

259
00:26:46,654 --> 00:26:49,262
But then her husband
died in a car crash.

260
00:26:49,262 --> 00:26:51,957
She had a break down.

261
00:26:54,607 --> 00:26:57,214
And what does she want now?

262
00:26:57,728 --> 00:26:59,690
When you and I were
in Georgia together.

263
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:02,098
She turned up here and
tried to slit her wrist

264
00:27:02,098 --> 00:27:04,193
in front of Mrs Jones,
my housekeeper.

265
00:27:04,193 --> 00:27:04,969
Oh my God...

266
00:27:04,969 --> 00:27:08,443
Cale took her to the hospital,
But the time I got there.

267
00:27:08,443 --> 00:27:10,153
She taken off.

268
00:27:10,153 --> 00:27:12,535
My people have been
trying to find her.

269
00:27:13,462 --> 00:27:16,250
Your people?

270
00:27:16,479 --> 00:27:19,058
Is that who put this together?

271
00:27:22,747 --> 00:27:24,965
Is there one on me?

272
00:27:29,525 --> 00:27:31,654
Let me see it.

273
00:27:58,666 --> 00:28:01,973
Subject works part time at
Clayton Hardware, Richmond Road.

274
00:28:03,026 --> 00:28:06,963
You know, they didn't
time my bathroom breaks.

275
00:28:07,398 --> 00:28:10,242
You should probably
get your money back.

276
00:28:11,050 --> 00:28:14,497
I had them drawn up and
any perspective submissive.

277
00:28:15,055 --> 00:28:16,356
Nice, Jesus.

278
00:28:16,786 --> 00:28:19,065
I had no idea what
this was gonna become.

279
00:28:19,065 --> 00:28:21,070
- I didn't know it would be different.
- Different?

280
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:23,970
Really?

281
00:28:24,674 --> 00:28:27,132
Is that why you brought
me to Mrs. Robinson?

282
00:28:27,132 --> 00:28:30,594
Where you brought all the other
women because I'm so different?

283
00:28:31,956 --> 00:28:37,190
- That was wrong, I admit.
- It's all wrong, all of this is wrong.

284
00:28:39,325 --> 00:28:43,192
You put money into my account.
That I don't want it.

285
00:28:43,403 --> 00:28:46,250
You bought the company I work for.

286
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:50,774
This isn't a relationship Christian,
It's ownership.

287
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:55,494
I'm trying to understand you.

288
00:28:55,753 --> 00:29:00,458
I'm just wanting to
get close to you.

289
00:29:02,072 --> 00:29:06,363
But it's really difficult to do that when
you keep doing bizarre things like this.

290
00:29:06,363 --> 00:29:09,898
And it's really difficult to do that
when you won't let me touch you.

291
00:29:18,892 --> 00:29:21,796
Come to my bedroom.

292
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:25,320
Sex is not gonna fix this right now.
Are you insane?

293
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:25,975
Anna.

294
00:29:26,522 --> 00:29:28,081
Please.

295
00:29:31,989 --> 00:29:33,903
You wanted a road map?

296
00:29:48,749 --> 00:29:50,256
Strike here.

297
00:30:25,101 --> 00:30:27,194
Those are my boundaries.

298
00:30:31,616 --> 00:30:33,707
I can live with that.

299
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:38,159
Then I'm all yours.

300
00:30:44,493 --> 00:30:46,689
Mr Grey,
your appointment has arrived.

301
00:30:47,758 --> 00:30:49,660
Send him into Anna's room.

302
00:30:51,623 --> 00:30:54,047
- He's here.
- Who is here?

303
00:31:00,057 --> 00:31:02,336
Harold, I think yes?

304
00:31:02,336 --> 00:31:05,762
Your neck is beautiful.

305
00:31:05,762 --> 00:31:08,109
Christian?

306
00:31:12,716 --> 00:31:14,817
Ciao, Bella.

307
00:32:01,244 --> 00:32:04,222
You're just gonna
stand there gawking?

308
00:32:04,222 --> 00:32:07,637
Yeah, I think I might.

309
00:32:26,494 --> 00:32:28,675
So I was thinking.

310
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:33,839
Tonight might be more stimulating.
If you wore these.

311
00:32:37,628 --> 00:32:40,855
How am I supposed to wear those?

312
00:32:41,334 --> 00:32:46,270
Well,
you have to get them wet first.

313
00:32:46,659 --> 00:32:47,619
Curious?

314
00:32:52,661 --> 00:32:54,432
Okay.

315
00:32:54,864 --> 00:32:56,651
Open your mouth.

316
00:33:05,888 --> 00:33:07,774
Good.

317
00:33:09,584 --> 00:33:12,502
Now turn, bend over.

318
00:33:13,072 --> 00:33:16,625
No, you're not putting
those in my butt.

319
00:33:16,625 --> 00:33:18,830
They don't go in your butt.

320
00:33:38,498 --> 00:33:40,228
Stay still.

321
00:33:48,164 --> 00:33:50,506
Stand up straight
and turn around.

322
00:33:59,609 --> 00:34:01,261
How is it feel?

323
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,095
Weird.

324
00:34:06,322 --> 00:34:07,402
But good.

325
00:34:09,967 --> 00:34:12,640
What do they do?

326
00:34:13,548 --> 00:34:15,477
You'll find out.

327
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:22,271
Wear the silver satin,
It will go well with this.

328
00:34:25,969 --> 00:34:29,043
Don't worry.
They are for your ears.

329
00:34:51,167 --> 00:34:53,821
Did I mention that
it was a masked ball?

330
00:34:53,821 --> 00:34:54,315
No.

331
00:34:58,037 --> 00:35:00,840
Your new bodyguards need to wear these too?

332
00:35:02,011 --> 00:35:03,224
Just being safe.

333
00:35:03,224 --> 00:35:05,982
You won't even
notice they are here.

334
00:35:07,354 --> 00:35:09,015
Come on!

335
00:35:51,427 --> 00:35:55,560
- Everybody is looking at us.
- Not us, you.

336
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:58,086
Christian,
I'm so glad you made it.

337
00:35:58,086 --> 00:36:01,189
- Mother.
- Mother is so formal honestly.

338
00:36:01,189 --> 00:36:02,936
Hi.
Hey.

339
00:36:03,767 --> 00:36:08,175
This things are beautiful. And they
are mysterious, they are pain in the ass.

340
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:13,179
- You look spectacular.
- Thank you.

341
00:36:13,179 --> 00:36:16,615
- So do you. This dress is so beautiful.
- Thank you Anna.

342
00:36:16,615 --> 00:36:20,640
I am so glad you are back with Christian.
He was lost without you.

343
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:23,528
- May I have my date back please?
- By all means.

344
00:36:23,528 --> 00:36:27,354
- Spoil sport.
- This way..

345
00:36:38,517 --> 00:36:43,739
Anna, My God.
your dress, it should be illegal.

346
00:36:43,739 --> 00:36:44,819
Yeah.
Mia.

347
00:36:47,617 --> 00:36:51,760
- Hey, I barely recognized you?
- Yeah, the new me.

348
00:36:53,045 --> 00:36:57,116
- Well, it is very bold.
- How do you stand him?

349
00:36:57,116 --> 00:36:59,895
Do you know that he was an
even bigger pain as a teenager?

350
00:36:59,895 --> 00:37:01,947
He got expelled from
4 different schools.

351
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:04,292
- For brawling.
- It's enough.

352
00:37:04,292 --> 00:37:06,135
- Yeah, totally out of control.
- Mia..

353
00:37:06,135 --> 00:37:08,919
- Enough.
- I'll be right back.

354
00:37:09,573 --> 00:37:11,517
<i>- Hi, how are you?
- Anna?</i>

355
00:37:11,517 --> 00:37:15,216
You will be sitting here darling,
Right next to Carrick.

356
00:37:15,216 --> 00:37:17,482
Welcome ladies and gentlemen...

357
00:37:17,482 --> 00:37:21,964
To our Annual Ball.
As you know, proceeds from this evening

358
00:37:21,964 --> 00:37:25,389
will go to the charity That Grace
and I founded so many years ago.

359
00:37:25,389 --> 00:37:29,753
Coping together, working to make
life better for the children.

360
00:37:29,753 --> 00:37:32,169
Of parents addicted to drugs.
Everything okay?

361
00:37:32,676 --> 00:37:36,560
And now thankfully I'll be
handing off my speaking duties

362
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:40,573
to our master of ceremonies
Mr. Newman Paul.

363
00:37:44,308 --> 00:37:45,148
Hungry?

364
00:37:50,606 --> 00:37:53,182
Now you know what those silver balls do.

365
00:37:53,781 --> 00:37:56,367
- 15 thousand dollars.
- 15 thousand dollars..

366
00:37:56,367 --> 00:38:00,680
Going once, going twice...
Sold!

367
00:38:02,816 --> 00:38:07,180
That's a great start, Ladies and Gentlemen.
Now lot number 2, a weeks vacation..

368
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:09,480
At a luxury Chalet.

369
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:13,111
in Aspen, Colorado, donated
by Mr. Christian Grey.

370
00:38:14,849 --> 00:38:16,831
Let's start the bid off at
ten thousand dollars.

371
00:38:16,831 --> 00:38:18,566
- Ten thousand.
- Thank you ma'am.

372
00:38:18,566 --> 00:38:19,929
Ten thousand dollars.

373
00:38:19,929 --> 00:38:22,338
I didn't know you
had a place in Aspen.

374
00:38:22,338 --> 00:38:25,218
I have a lot of places.

375
00:38:25,813 --> 00:38:27,967
Seventeen Thousand.

376
00:38:27,967 --> 00:38:29,662
Seventeen thousand
dollars, thank you, sir.

377
00:38:29,662 --> 00:38:30,176
Eighteen?

378
00:38:30,176 --> 00:38:33,016
- Eighteen thousand,
- Eighteen thousand dollars, thank you!

379
00:38:33,016 --> 00:38:36,957
- Do I hear 19?..19?
- 19! 19 Thousand dollars.

380
00:38:36,957 --> 00:38:37,958
Thank you sir.
A week of...

381
00:38:37,958 --> 00:38:40,814
Luxury in America's finest ski resort.

382
00:38:40,814 --> 00:38:45,871
- 24 Thousand dollars.
- New blood, 24 Thousand dollars.

383
00:38:45,871 --> 00:38:48,945
- Do I hear 25 Thousand?
- The money was for you.

384
00:38:48,945 --> 00:38:51,950
And now it will go to
someone who needs it.

385
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:54,918
I don't know whether to
worship at your feet...

386
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:57,166
Or spank you.

387
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:01,984
- Going once.. Going twice.
- I think, um...Take option two.

388
00:39:03,956 --> 00:39:06,548
Sold to the young
lady in silver.

389
00:39:14,898 --> 00:39:15,899
Let's go.

390
00:39:42,457 --> 00:39:46,178
You want this?

391
00:40:23,991 --> 00:40:27,542
If you think it's too much.
You just tell me to stop. Understood?

392
00:40:27,542 --> 00:40:28,543
Yeah.

393
00:40:59,724 --> 00:41:01,445
Hold still.

394
00:41:54,765 --> 00:41:57,604
Is this your room?

395
00:41:58,067 --> 00:41:59,668
Once upon a time.

396
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:13,913
Who is this?

397
00:42:17,565 --> 00:42:19,012
Is that your mother?

398
00:42:26,288 --> 00:42:28,888
You know you can just say
you don't wanna talk about it.

399
00:42:28,888 --> 00:42:31,670
Yeah, I don't wanna talk about it.

400
00:42:33,199 --> 00:42:36,031
Let's go.
They'll be missing us.

401
00:42:37,143 --> 00:42:39,535
Uh, I just need a minute.

402
00:42:40,754 --> 00:42:43,183
- I'll meet you downstairs.
- Okay.

403
00:42:44,251 --> 00:42:46,603
Don't forget your mask.

404
00:43:25,230 --> 00:43:28,065
- What?
- Nothing.

405
00:43:51,772 --> 00:43:53,579
Christian has a date.

406
00:43:54,170 --> 00:43:58,543
- I'm impressed.
- I'm sorry?

407
00:43:59,131 --> 00:44:02,937
Elena. I wanted
to meet you.

408
00:44:05,275 --> 00:44:10,233
- I can't say the same, excuse me.
- Hey, I'm not the enemy.

409
00:44:12,148 --> 00:44:14,942
I know what you did to Christian.

410
00:44:14,942 --> 00:44:18,364
All I did was to lead him to
the truth of who he really is.

411
00:44:18,910 --> 00:44:22,560
Without me, he'd be in jail.
Or dead.

412
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,343
And he would say the same.

413
00:44:24,343 --> 00:44:28,811
Do you think you're the first
woman he helped to save him?

414
00:44:29,178 --> 00:44:31,988
He needs a submissive in life.

415
00:44:32,415 --> 00:44:35,466
Not just in the bed room.

416
00:44:35,837 --> 00:44:40,696
No, he's changing that.
It's not he wants anymore.

417
00:44:40,696 --> 00:44:43,140
But it's what he needs.
And you don't strike me

418
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:45,475
as the type of women
who wants to be owned.

419
00:44:46,282 --> 00:44:50,157
If you really wanna make him happy,
If you wanna be happy.

420
00:44:50,849 --> 00:44:54,377
- You let him go.
- There is no way.

421
00:44:54,690 --> 00:44:57,613
That someone like you could
ever understand what we have.

422
00:44:57,613 --> 00:45:01,509
I've been there nothing less.

423
00:45:01,993 --> 00:45:03,481
Nothing.

424
00:45:03,823 --> 00:45:06,449
Whatever happens between
me and Christian,

425
00:45:06,449 --> 00:45:08,543
is none of your
goddamn business.

426
00:45:08,543 --> 00:45:11,121
So you stay the
fuck away from us.

427
00:45:17,105 --> 00:45:18,443
Hey.

428
00:45:18,922 --> 00:45:21,610
- We should think about going. So..
- I wanna go now.

429
00:45:31,350 --> 00:45:32,916
What did Elena say to you?

430
00:45:38,706 --> 00:45:41,601
Nothing I didn't already know.

431
00:45:45,071 --> 00:45:47,458
Will you just take me to my house?

432
00:45:47,968 --> 00:45:50,314
Stay with me tonight.

433
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,780
Hey, wake up.
We're home.

434
00:46:11,590 --> 00:46:13,019
Sir?

435
00:46:14,473 --> 00:46:16,371
Stay here.

436
00:46:43,423 --> 00:46:44,796
What happened?

437
00:46:45,699 --> 00:46:47,879
That's my car.
What happened to my car?

438
00:46:48,108 --> 00:46:49,672
Check the apartment.
Tell me when it's safe.

439
00:46:49,697 --> 00:46:51,220
Yes Sir, right away.

440
00:46:51,220 --> 00:46:53,326
Smith you stick
with Mr Grey

441
00:46:54,785 --> 00:46:56,162
Where are we going?

442
00:46:56,882 --> 00:46:58,351
Christian?

443
00:46:59,445 --> 00:47:00,920
Do you think it was Elena?

444
00:47:01,489 --> 00:47:03,970
You really think she would
do something like that?

445
00:47:07,357 --> 00:47:10,085
I really don't see why we just
can't go back to your apartment.

446
00:47:10,085 --> 00:47:12,003
That place is like a fortress.

447
00:47:12,090 --> 00:47:14,182
There is no way,
she could've gotten in there.

448
00:47:14,182 --> 00:47:17,081
She shouldn't be able to get
into the garage either.

449
00:47:17,534 --> 00:47:19,592
I'm not taking any chances.

450
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:30,367
- Hey, Mr Grey!
- The Yacht.

451
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:34,397
That's the crew.
We'll be here to the morning.

452
00:47:41,138 --> 00:47:43,682
If something would've
happened to you because of me.

453
00:47:44,074 --> 00:47:46,443
It won't.

454
00:47:46,785 --> 00:47:48,912
Nothing's gonna happen to me.

455
00:47:56,229 --> 00:47:58,365
Can I wash this off?

456
00:48:01,739 --> 00:48:04,618
- Don't stray from the lines.
- Okay.

457
00:48:36,256 --> 00:48:41,773
Are these burns?
Who did this to you?

458
00:48:43,844 --> 00:48:46,151
Go on. It's over.

459
00:48:52,024 --> 00:48:55,228
I know how difficult
it is for you to,

460
00:48:56,379 --> 00:48:59,696
Open up to me and...

461
00:49:00,148 --> 00:49:02,970
tell me these things.

462
00:49:05,601 --> 00:49:08,720
You gotta mean the world to me.

463
00:49:09,866 --> 00:49:12,280
It means you love me.

464
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:16,474
Yes, I do.

465
00:49:45,052 --> 00:49:48,278
So this is where your knot
tying expertise comes from.

466
00:49:48,278 --> 00:49:51,850
Good morning.
You sleep well?

467
00:49:51,850 --> 00:49:53,687
I did.

468
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:57,802
This boat is really beautiful.

469
00:49:58,174 --> 00:50:00,227
This is from my Yard in Seattle.

470
00:50:00,676 --> 00:50:04,213
- You build it?
- I had some help.

471
00:50:04,485 --> 00:50:06,287
It's called the Grace.

472
00:50:08,187 --> 00:50:12,315
- After your mom?
- You seem surprised!

473
00:50:12,315 --> 00:50:15,924
Why you're always
so cool towards him?

474
00:50:16,362 --> 00:50:18,403
I will ever think of Grace.

475
00:50:18,403 --> 00:50:21,276
She saved my life after
my birth mom died.

476
00:50:23,722 --> 00:50:25,468
Do you remember your birth mom?

477
00:50:26,187 --> 00:50:27,520
I try not to.

478
00:50:30,412 --> 00:50:33,319
What happened to her?

479
00:50:33,682 --> 00:50:37,755
She overdosed,
they found her body three days later.

480
00:50:39,482 --> 00:50:42,795
- Where were you?
- I was with her.

481
00:50:44,535 --> 00:50:45,775
My god!

482
00:50:47,611 --> 00:50:49,859
Took her away...
Took me to hospital.

483
00:50:51,327 --> 00:50:54,428
Grace was there.

484
00:50:56,946 --> 00:50:59,320
Thank you for telling me.

485
00:51:04,007 --> 00:51:06,696
Look at that house.

486
00:51:07,824 --> 00:51:10,156
That's beautiful.

487
00:51:10,156 --> 00:51:13,128
The view is probably amazing.
I wonder who lives there.

488
00:51:13,758 --> 00:51:17,999
It's an old sea widow.
Lost her husband years ago.

489
00:51:17,999 --> 00:51:21,201
She sits at the window every night,
waiting for him to come home.

490
00:51:22,948 --> 00:51:25,794
- Did you just make that up?
- Yeah.

491
00:51:28,411 --> 00:51:30,533
You want to take that home?

492
00:51:30,533 --> 00:51:33,826
- Me?
- Yeah, you! come on.

493
00:51:33,826 --> 00:51:35,823
You can't do that.

494
00:51:59,638 --> 00:52:00,939
Right there.

495
00:52:00,939 --> 00:52:02,813
- Okay?
- Okay.

496
00:52:11,365 --> 00:52:15,289
- Don't let go.
- Ok, I have to. Don't.

497
00:52:15,289 --> 00:52:15,812
Okay?

498
00:52:15,812 --> 00:52:17,991
- You Ready?
- Okay.

499
00:52:33,387 --> 00:52:36,150
I'm steering it, I'm doing it.

500
00:52:36,150 --> 00:52:38,149
I'm the captain.

501
00:52:51,379 --> 00:52:53,609
- Hi.
- Hey Jack.

502
00:52:53,609 --> 00:52:56,275
Personal calls on your own time okay?

503
00:53:04,933 --> 00:53:06,022
<i>Ya?</i>

504
00:53:06,022 --> 00:53:08,210
Did you get my message?

505
00:53:08,210 --> 00:53:12,557
You had a phone call this
morning with Rick Crussi at 9am.

506
00:53:12,582 --> 00:53:13,411
Shit.

507
00:53:14,141 --> 00:53:16,621
I just gonna reschedule
that. I'll ask them.

508
00:53:16,621 --> 00:53:20,131
Did you book our rooms?
For New York Camp?

509
00:53:20,406 --> 00:53:20,814
Sorry?

510
00:53:20,814 --> 00:53:24,893
The New York Book expo, this Friday.
It's in the diary.

511
00:53:24,893 --> 00:53:27,365
Yeah, I know.
Yeah, I booked your room of course.

512
00:53:27,762 --> 00:53:31,673
And you? I was expecting that
my assistant also attends.

513
00:53:33,688 --> 00:53:35,706
I didnt know that.
I'm sorry.

514
00:53:35,706 --> 00:53:38,546
Don't apologize,
just get yourself a room.

515
00:53:39,521 --> 00:53:42,837
Unless you rather stay
back with your boyfriend.

516
00:53:43,295 --> 00:53:45,557
It's not like you need the work.

517
00:53:47,868 --> 00:53:50,077
I'll sort it out.

518
00:53:50,077 --> 00:53:52,280
Hey Rick, it's Jack.
How was your weekend?

519
00:53:54,585 --> 00:53:55,770
<i>No shit?</i>

520
00:54:04,041 --> 00:54:07,858
<i>They're amazing amazing."
But I can't put it down.</i>

521
00:55:05,828 --> 00:55:06,548
Hello?

522
00:55:10,623 --> 00:55:12,023
Christian?

523
00:55:14,866 --> 00:55:16,992
- Oh, Oh my God!
- Excuse me Miss Steele.

524
00:55:16,992 --> 00:55:19,343
- I didn't mean to startle you.
- No, no...

525
00:55:19,343 --> 00:55:22,738
I...
You were very quiet.

526
00:55:22,738 --> 00:55:24,793
I am Mrs. Jones,
Mr. Grace's housekeeper.

527
00:55:24,793 --> 00:55:25,900
May I?

528
00:55:27,524 --> 00:55:29,872
Sure...
Thank you.

529
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:35,797
I am Anna. But you knew that
already, because you've seen me last week.

530
00:55:36,203 --> 00:55:39,582
Mr Grey is in his study
just finishing up a call.

531
00:55:39,582 --> 00:55:41,766
- I'll be in the kitchen if you need me.
- I'll be fine.

532
00:56:59,536 --> 00:57:01,671
You see anything you like?

533
00:57:05,705 --> 00:57:08,345
The door was unlocked.

534
00:57:09,718 --> 00:57:12,545
I'll have to talk to Mrs. Jones.

535
00:57:14,254 --> 00:57:15,890
Does she come in here a lot?

536
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:21,021
Dust in here?

537
00:57:22,991 --> 00:57:25,221
That was her nipple clips.

538
00:57:29,190 --> 00:57:31,691
Come here, give me your hand.

539
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,318
It's even more intense
when you take 'em off.

540
00:58:00,671 --> 00:58:01,934
What's this?

541
00:58:03,890 --> 00:58:07,360
Ok, that's enough show and tell.

542
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:09,122
What's this?

543
00:58:09,351 --> 00:58:12,788
Let's learn to walk before we run.

544
00:58:14,513 --> 00:58:16,845
I kinda like running.

545
00:58:22,728 --> 00:58:27,021
Last time we did this.
You saw another side of me.

546
00:58:27,661 --> 00:58:29,028
And you left.

547
00:58:29,823 --> 00:58:33,035
Last time was different.

548
00:58:39,033 --> 00:58:41,605
All right! But not here.

549
00:58:43,203 --> 00:58:45,901
Mrs. Jones.

550
00:58:46,558 --> 00:58:48,478
<i>Oh my God.</i>

551
01:00:22,274 --> 01:00:23,604
You're mine.

552
01:00:25,273 --> 01:00:27,072
I'm yours.

553
01:00:56,410 --> 01:00:58,185
- You okay?
- Yeah.

554
01:01:23,719 --> 01:01:26,785
You know at some point we're
gonna need to talk about New York.

555
01:01:27,149 --> 01:01:28,402
We have talked about it.

556
01:01:28,632 --> 01:01:31,081
You, forbidding is
not us talking about it.

557
01:01:32,493 --> 01:01:35,994
If you wanna go to New York,
don't go with Hyde.

558
01:01:35,994 --> 01:01:37,151
let me take you.
I have a place there.

559
01:01:37,496 --> 01:01:41,096
Of course you do.
This isn't some sort of vacation..

560
01:01:41,096 --> 01:01:44,461
It's a work-trip with my boss.
Who I would like to impress.

561
01:01:45,797 --> 01:01:49,467
You know he's had 3 assistants in
the last 18 months. All of them quit.

562
01:01:49,467 --> 01:01:51,663
- Without notice.
- You don't think I can handle him?

563
01:01:51,940 --> 01:01:53,783
That's not it.

564
01:01:54,045 --> 01:01:56,149
That's what it feels like.

565
01:01:57,511 --> 01:02:00,783
Anna, I know full well that
you can handle anything.

566
01:02:01,059 --> 01:02:05,756
And if you really wanna go,
then I can't stop you.

567
01:02:06,546 --> 01:02:08,999
But I would like to
take you there myself.

568
01:02:13,568 --> 01:02:15,053
Okay.

569
01:02:16,950 --> 01:02:19,088
- Okay?
- Yeah.

570
01:02:20,224 --> 01:02:23,692
I mean of course,
I would rather see New York with you.

571
01:02:24,126 --> 01:02:27,850
God, I hate it when we fight.

572
01:02:28,859 --> 01:02:33,685
That wasn't a fight.
That was a conversation.

573
01:02:33,932 --> 01:02:36,162
That was, you know,
when somebody talks,

574
01:02:36,162 --> 01:02:39,147
and the other person listens
and you resolve an issue.

575
01:02:39,147 --> 01:02:42,263
- That's how it works.
- It's crazy. Isn't it?

576
01:02:44,724 --> 01:02:47,546
- Good night Anna.
- Good night Hanna.

577
01:03:13,799 --> 01:03:14,571
You leaving?

578
01:03:14,571 --> 01:03:17,818
I was actually just
about to come talk to you.

579
01:03:17,818 --> 01:03:19,594
About New York.

580
01:03:20,231 --> 01:03:21,519
Is there a problem?

581
01:03:22,765 --> 01:03:27,009
I'm so grateful for the
opportunity Jack but..

582
01:03:27,009 --> 01:03:30,322
with such short notice,
I made plans that I can't change.

583
01:03:30,869 --> 01:03:35,325
But I will have my phone on me all weekend.
So if you need anything, I'm available.

584
01:03:37,861 --> 01:03:38,912
Anna, have a seat.

585
01:03:42,629 --> 01:03:44,156
I'm really, I'm sorry.

586
01:03:47,350 --> 01:03:49,996
I think you have tremendous potential here.

587
01:03:51,267 --> 01:03:53,486
But I don't wanna waste
my time training someone

588
01:03:53,486 --> 01:03:55,498
who doesn't take this
position seriously.

589
01:03:55,498 --> 01:03:59,437
- I do! This is my dream job.
- Well then, shouldn't..

590
01:03:59,437 --> 01:04:03,007
going to New York in the book expo,
be part of that dream?

591
01:04:03,007 --> 01:04:06,228
...It is it is...

592
01:04:06,228 --> 01:04:08,528
It was just a misunderstanding.
It won't happen again.

593
01:04:08,528 --> 01:04:11,431
Because there are plenty
of qualified people.

594
01:04:11,431 --> 01:04:13,486
Who would kill for this job.

595
01:04:13,486 --> 01:04:16,191
Look, I don't wanna brag.
But I'm a..

596
01:04:16,191 --> 01:04:18,500
Pretty great teacher.

597
01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:21,643
I'm sure you are.

598
01:04:21,643 --> 01:04:26,100
I'm just not seeing the
initiative on your side of it.

599
01:04:27,025 --> 01:04:29,420
I've read more that you ask me to.

600
01:04:30,093 --> 01:04:32,817
- And I'm on top of.
- I'm talking about.

601
01:04:32,817 --> 01:04:36,048
Going the extra mile...

602
01:04:36,816 --> 01:04:39,378
...Unless you want me too.

603
01:04:39,633 --> 01:04:42,662
Compete with Christian Grey.

604
01:04:43,135 --> 01:04:45,209
For your attention.

605
01:04:45,521 --> 01:04:50,359
I apologize that Christian was
so curt with you the other night.

606
01:04:50,359 --> 01:04:52,763
Is that what this is about?

607
01:04:53,164 --> 01:04:57,261
Your boyfriend has a reputation for being..

608
01:04:58,386 --> 01:05:01,432
a little ruthless.
Is that what you like?

609
01:05:02,359 --> 01:05:05,825
If you have problem with my work,
then you should take it up with HR.

610
01:05:06,273 --> 01:05:09,376
Why are you being so serious?

611
01:05:09,376 --> 01:05:12,131
What do you think I'm gonna do?
Make you fuck me?

612
01:05:12,131 --> 01:05:13,885
Jack.

613
01:05:13,885 --> 01:05:15,901
I just think.

614
01:05:16,859 --> 01:05:19,209
I just think.

615
01:05:20,148 --> 01:05:23,011
If you gonna fuck?
then you should do it

616
01:05:23,011 --> 01:05:26,405
with someone who can at
least make you smarter.

617
01:05:28,312 --> 01:05:30,470
Not just richer.

618
01:05:30,828 --> 01:05:31,548
Right?

619
01:05:33,135 --> 01:05:36,474
- Don't.
- Don't what?

620
01:05:37,378 --> 01:05:41,494
None of these is serious, Serious question.

621
01:05:42,502 --> 01:05:44,622
Do you wanna be kept?

622
01:05:46,712 --> 01:05:49,120
Or taken seriously?

623
01:05:49,827 --> 01:05:54,234
- I like to leave, please Jack.
- Plus.

624
01:05:55,423 --> 01:05:58,074
I can make you cum.

625
01:05:58,074 --> 01:06:00,755
Like nobody else has.

626
01:06:01,515 --> 01:06:03,957
Not him.

627
01:06:04,582 --> 01:06:08,190
- Not anyone.
- No.

628
01:06:17,683 --> 01:06:19,332
Anna?
Anna, what happened?

629
01:06:19,332 --> 01:06:22,323
Jack. It's Jack.
He's trying to..

630
01:06:22,323 --> 01:06:23,112
To touch me.

631
01:06:23,112 --> 01:06:25,860
- I'll kill him.
- No, no, please don't go.

632
01:06:25,860 --> 01:06:27,693
Don't go.
Don't leave me please.

633
01:06:27,693 --> 01:06:30,192
Go. It's okay.
Hey.

634
01:06:31,158 --> 01:06:33,448
I left everything.
I don't have any of my stuff.

635
01:06:33,448 --> 01:06:36,547
It's fine.
Let's go come on.

636
01:06:36,547 --> 01:06:41,307
And his pass has been canceled.
Good.

637
01:06:41,307 --> 01:06:44,022
No. Thank you Jerry.
Good night.

638
01:06:48,260 --> 01:06:50,603
Well, at least that's dealt with.

639
01:06:50,603 --> 01:06:52,977
Heim's out.
He's been fired.

640
01:06:56,213 --> 01:06:57,800
How?
That's.

641
01:06:58,390 --> 01:07:02,592
You. But I thought your deal
with SAP hasn't been finished yet.

642
01:07:02,592 --> 01:07:05,794
It's not.
But I know the CEO.

643
01:07:06,293 --> 01:07:07,784
I told 'em what happened.

644
01:07:08,693 --> 01:07:10,537
You'll never have
to see him again.

645
01:07:11,401 --> 01:07:13,792
Am I still gonna have a
job now he's not there?

646
01:07:14,799 --> 01:07:17,402
- Well, if you don't, you can...
- Christian.

647
01:07:17,402 --> 01:07:19,770
You know I love working.

648
01:07:20,076 --> 01:07:22,930
You can't keep me locked
up in your penthouse.

649
01:07:27,907 --> 01:07:29,227
What if I give you a key?

650
01:07:31,148 --> 01:07:34,060
I mean..
what if you have a key and..

651
01:07:34,060 --> 01:07:37,003
You kept some of your stuff here.

652
01:07:37,003 --> 01:07:39,625
Keep all of your stuff here.

653
01:07:39,625 --> 01:07:42,247
And you slept, you know?

654
01:07:42,247 --> 01:07:44,190
Not at your place.

655
01:07:46,735 --> 01:07:49,719
Are you asking me to move in with you?

656
01:07:55,555 --> 01:07:58,095
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

657
01:08:00,077 --> 01:08:02,227
I want you here all the time.

658
01:08:03,765 --> 01:08:05,446
As soon as possible.

659
01:08:11,838 --> 01:08:14,469
What'd happen to learning
to walk before we run?

660
01:08:16,378 --> 01:08:20,148
Well, that's just one of the many things
that we can talk about over breakfast.

661
01:08:26,179 --> 01:08:27,942
Can I think about it?

662
01:08:28,439 --> 01:08:29,399
Sure.
Ya.

663
01:08:40,072 --> 01:08:42,240
- Liz, hi.
- Anna.

664
01:08:42,240 --> 01:08:44,720
Don't know if you've heard.
Jack resigned last night.

665
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:48,810
I'm kind of a hurry. Seth isn't recruiting
right now. So we're screwed.

666
01:08:49,190 --> 01:08:51,299
So you don't need me anymore then?

667
01:08:51,299 --> 01:08:53,051
We're trying to find
you something temporary.

668
01:08:53,051 --> 01:08:55,240
Could you to fill in for Jack
in this morning meeting?

669
01:08:55,932 --> 01:08:58,869
- At the senior editors' meeting?
- Just for today.

670
01:08:58,869 --> 01:09:00,904
You're the only one who
knows Jack entire slate.

671
01:09:00,904 --> 01:09:01,576
Well yeah,

672
01:09:01,576 --> 01:09:04,655
but I.. I.. I..

673
01:09:06,509 --> 01:09:08,148
You're right.
That's too much.

674
01:09:10,913 --> 01:09:12,438
No. I can
do it.

675
01:09:13,790 --> 01:09:15,416
It's fine.
I can do it.

676
01:09:17,018 --> 01:09:18,054
Great.

677
01:09:20,666 --> 01:09:22,666
Call me when you're done.

678
01:09:25,100 --> 01:09:28,609
We need to print fewer titles.
Stick with established authors.

679
01:09:28,609 --> 01:09:31,913
- Focus on our core readership.
- Expand it.

680
01:09:32,970 --> 01:09:33,690
I'm sorry.

681
01:09:35,430 --> 01:09:38,531
So Anna.
What do you think we should be publishing?

682
01:09:40,853 --> 01:09:43,131
Um..
Newer voices.

683
01:09:43,131 --> 01:09:45,161
Along with your established authors.

684
01:09:45,537 --> 01:09:49,850
Voice Fox, for example,
got 80,000 hits last week.

685
01:09:49,850 --> 01:09:50,428
Really?

686
01:09:50,428 --> 01:09:54,886
Online don't automatically
translate to print sales.

687
01:09:54,886 --> 01:09:57,373
Well..
but they could.

688
01:09:57,373 --> 01:10:00,436
His online audience is
the 18 to 24 demographics.

689
01:10:00,436 --> 01:10:03,704
And those are exactly the
readers we should be chasing.

690
01:10:04,240 --> 01:10:08,240
I mean I can show you the stats. I Really,
I think he is worth taking a risk on.

691
01:10:10,642 --> 01:10:11,932
Maybe we should take a look.

692
01:10:22,208 --> 01:10:23,684
Great idea.

693
01:10:25,362 --> 01:10:27,112
Er.. Anna?

694
01:10:27,681 --> 01:10:30,226
Mr Roach.
I'm really sorry if I was out of line.

695
01:10:30,226 --> 01:10:32,800
No. Don't be sorry.
You make lot of sense.

696
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:36,815
Now. So what are you doing
now that Jack Heim is gone?

697
01:10:37,131 --> 01:10:40,130
Um.. Well, Liz mentioned
something temporary.

698
01:10:40,130 --> 01:10:41,114
I don't know.

699
01:10:41,114 --> 01:10:44,220
Okay. Well, why don't you
fill in for Jack temporarily?

700
01:10:44,572 --> 01:10:47,358
- Good?
- Um..

701
01:10:47,747 --> 01:10:51,158
Great. Okay.
That's settled.

702
01:10:52,364 --> 01:10:56,780
- To SIP's new fiction editor.
- Acting fiction editor.

703
01:11:02,483 --> 01:11:04,380
Christian,
did you have something to do with this?

704
01:11:04,990 --> 01:11:08,890
No. Hey,
it was all you.

705
01:11:10,850 --> 01:11:14,409
- But you don't believe me?
- I don't believe it myself.

706
01:11:18,730 --> 01:11:22,940
- I asked you a question last night.
- About moving in with you?

707
01:11:28,656 --> 01:11:31,593
I just think that I'm probably..

708
01:11:32,636 --> 01:11:35,396
I need to get somethings from my apartment.

709
01:11:38,680 --> 01:11:40,151
That can be arranged.

710
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:42,565
Good.

711
01:11:44,147 --> 01:11:49,469
Now, maybe we could,
take this celebration home.

712
01:11:51,919 --> 01:11:54,251
The Check please.

713
01:12:03,192 --> 01:12:06,216
Take off your panties.

714
01:12:06,507 --> 01:12:08,067
Do it now.

715
01:12:10,250 --> 01:12:14,289
- Right in here?
- Yeah, right here, now.

716
01:14:03,535 --> 01:14:04,709
Don't cum.

717
01:14:28,703 --> 01:14:31,970
And Jenny need someone to
sign off on the new Crushi.

718
01:14:33,171 --> 01:14:35,639
I kept asking Jack to do that.

719
01:14:35,639 --> 01:14:39,773
Yeah well, Jack was kind of lazy.
Didn't you notice?

720
01:14:39,773 --> 01:14:43,907
Yah. I believe he called
it artistic temperament.

721
01:14:46,606 --> 01:14:49,131
Thank you Hanna.

722
01:14:53,090 --> 01:14:54,096
Hey.

723
01:14:54,764 --> 01:14:56,851
It's great that you're doing this.

724
01:14:56,851 --> 01:14:58,969
But it's totally weird.
I know.

725
01:14:58,969 --> 01:15:01,406
- I know.
- Meaning?

726
01:15:01,406 --> 01:15:03,867
Am I expected to call you Miss Steele?

727
01:15:03,867 --> 01:15:05,670
I expect you to call me Anna.

728
01:15:06,239 --> 01:15:08,899
And I don't expect you to fetch me coffee.

729
01:15:08,899 --> 01:15:11,589
Unless you're getting some for yourself.

730
01:15:11,589 --> 01:15:12,768
And..

731
01:15:13,352 --> 01:15:18,639
The rest of it, we'll just
make up as we go. Okay?

732
01:15:18,978 --> 01:15:20,161
Okay.

733
01:15:37,287 --> 01:15:38,349
Miss Steele.

734
01:15:42,317 --> 01:15:43,864
Damn it.

735
01:15:44,645 --> 01:15:47,044
Take it. I'm just gonna grab
some stuff and check them out.

736
01:15:47,044 --> 01:15:49,908
- I should go over help with you.
- No. It's okay. I'd just be 2 seconds.

737
01:15:49,908 --> 01:15:51,454
It's all good.

738
01:15:53,130 --> 01:15:54,222
Hey Ross.

739
01:16:35,950 --> 01:16:37,067
Leila.

740
01:16:41,969 --> 01:16:47,869
Christian is downstairs.
Do you want to see him?

741
01:16:49,880 --> 01:16:52,200
I came to see you.

742
01:16:55,228 --> 01:16:56,228
Okay.

743
01:16:59,895 --> 01:17:01,593
He told me what happened.

744
01:17:05,621 --> 01:17:08,018
I know you're in a lot of pain.

745
01:17:09,294 --> 01:17:11,294
I'm so sorry.

746
01:17:11,781 --> 01:17:14,157
He lets you call him by his name.

747
01:17:15,566 --> 01:17:20,177
He talks about you all the time.
He cares about you.

748
01:17:24,605 --> 01:17:26,263
Don't lie.

749
01:17:29,485 --> 01:17:31,384
Tell me what you have that I don't.

750
01:17:32,674 --> 01:17:33,913
Nothing.

751
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:38,056
I'm nothing.

752
01:17:40,610 --> 01:17:42,337
He'll get tired of me.

753
01:17:42,813 --> 01:17:45,065
Master sleeps in your bed.

754
01:17:45,603 --> 01:17:48,055
- How do you know that?
- I saw you.

755
01:17:49,103 --> 01:17:53,241
I watched you.
I know you love him.

756
01:17:53,241 --> 01:17:54,965
I do too.

757
01:17:55,980 --> 01:17:57,351
We all do.

758
01:17:58,194 --> 01:18:01,146
- Why don't you put the gun down?
- You don't know him.

759
01:18:01,146 --> 01:18:04,037
What he likes.
You don't give him what he wants.

760
01:18:04,037 --> 01:18:06,886
He's pretending with you.

761
01:18:19,564 --> 01:18:21,029
No. Christian.

762
01:18:43,126 --> 01:18:44,754
Kneel.

763
01:19:03,412 --> 01:19:04,454
Anna.

764
01:19:05,179 --> 01:19:07,017
Go to... wait for me there.

765
01:19:11,879 --> 01:19:14,714
For once, just do as you're told.

766
01:19:19,106 --> 01:19:21,146
Taylor, get her outta here.

767
01:19:34,361 --> 01:19:35,376
Miss Steele.

768
01:19:41,995 --> 01:19:46,468
- Miss Steele? Anna?
- Stop it, Taylor.

769
01:21:13,650 --> 01:21:19,537
I don't care. She's been gone for 3 hours,
she doesn't have her cell.

770
01:21:19,537 --> 01:21:20,912
Or her purse.

771
01:21:24,358 --> 01:21:26,226
Forget it, she's here.

772
01:21:30,706 --> 01:21:32,410
Where the fuck have you been?

773
01:21:35,722 --> 01:21:37,291
I told you to come straight here.

774
01:21:37,291 --> 01:21:40,031
I have had people out combing
the streets looking for you.

775
01:21:40,031 --> 01:21:43,179
I'm sorry I don't always do as I'm told.

776
01:21:43,179 --> 01:21:46,878
Maybe you just really need
someone who obeys every command.

777
01:21:47,096 --> 01:21:48,535
Don't be ridiculous.

778
01:21:48,535 --> 01:21:52,592
I saw you. Christian.
I saw the way you were with Leila.

779
01:21:52,592 --> 01:21:56,655
She had a gun Anna.
I would do anything to subdue her.

780
01:21:58,295 --> 01:21:59,696
Where is she now?

781
01:22:00,720 --> 01:22:02,020
Is she here?

782
01:22:02,020 --> 01:22:04,428
- Is she here?
- What? No. Of course not.

783
01:22:04,669 --> 01:22:07,383
She's in a psych ward getting
the help that she needs.

784
01:22:09,900 --> 01:22:11,118
Lucky.

785
01:22:11,118 --> 01:22:13,928
- I know she scares you.
- Yeah. She scare me.

786
01:22:16,010 --> 01:22:21,859
But you scare me more.
Seeing you like that with her.

787
01:22:21,859 --> 01:22:24,371
I will never be able to give you that.

788
01:22:24,371 --> 01:22:28,253
Kind of submission and obedience.

789
01:22:28,253 --> 01:22:29,285
Anna.

790
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:32,479
Don't crowd me.
I need space.

791
01:22:32,479 --> 01:22:34,169
- Now please don't do.
- Christian.

792
01:22:34,169 --> 01:22:37,599
- Don't give up on me.
- I just need to think a little bit.

793
01:22:37,599 --> 01:22:39,903
Don't leave me.

794
01:22:43,200 --> 01:22:44,647
What are you doing?

795
01:22:46,070 --> 01:22:47,460
Get up.

796
01:22:50,530 --> 01:22:52,032
What are you doing?

797
01:22:52,907 --> 01:22:57,298
Look at me.
Look at me.

798
01:23:04,030 --> 01:23:05,575
I'm scared.

799
01:23:10,406 --> 01:23:12,995
I know you say that I'm enough.

800
01:23:15,925 --> 01:23:19,015
But there are certain things
that you're used to getting.

801
01:23:19,015 --> 01:23:23,259
That I will never ever
ever be able to give you.

802
01:23:25,518 --> 01:23:28,935
And it might be fine for right now, but..

803
01:23:29,460 --> 01:23:32,300
What's gonna happen when
you start needing them again?

804
01:23:32,300 --> 01:23:33,026
I won't.

805
01:23:33,230 --> 01:23:36,033
How do you know that?
How can I believe you,

806
01:23:36,033 --> 01:23:38,693
I don't even understand
your need to dominate.

807
01:23:38,693 --> 01:23:42,252
I'm not a dominant.
I'm not.

808
01:23:43,113 --> 01:23:45,209
The right term is a sadist?

809
01:23:46,291 --> 01:23:49,472
I get off in punishing woman.
Woman who look like you.

810
01:23:49,472 --> 01:23:50,822
Like your mother.

811
01:23:52,517 --> 01:23:53,561
Yes.

812
01:23:53,561 --> 01:23:56,186
And I know how fucked up that is.

813
01:23:56,794 --> 01:23:59,994
When you left,

814
01:23:59,994 --> 01:24:04,401
I swore that I would stop if that's
what it took to get you back.

815
01:24:05,076 --> 01:24:06,949
But I'm done with it.

816
01:24:07,773 --> 01:24:11,283
You mean more to me than anything else.

817
01:24:14,585 --> 01:24:18,783
I want to believe you.
I do. But I can't. I..

818
01:24:18,783 --> 01:24:21,290
Anna, give me your hand.

819
01:24:24,125 --> 01:24:25,175
This is me.
All of me.

820
01:24:29,930 --> 01:24:32,451
- Christian.
- I'm all yours.

821
01:25:35,379 --> 01:25:36,383
No.

822
01:25:39,856 --> 01:25:40,945
No.

823
01:25:42,625 --> 01:25:47,401
Hey.. hey.. hey.. hey.. It's okay.
I'm right here.

824
01:25:48,100 --> 01:25:49,690
I'm right here.

825
01:25:54,478 --> 01:25:56,147
Marry me.

826
01:25:57,135 --> 01:26:00,381
- What?
- I want you to marry me.

827
01:26:03,163 --> 01:26:07,119
Christian.
I think you're dreaming.

828
01:27:10,161 --> 01:27:13,112
- Good morning.
- Morning.

829
01:27:16,344 --> 01:27:19,375
- Sleep okay?
- I did.

830
01:27:19,375 --> 01:27:22,436
- You?
- Like a luck.

831
01:27:22,436 --> 01:27:24,458
Out all night.

832
01:27:28,013 --> 01:27:33,458
You didn't..
have any weird dreams or anything or like.

833
01:27:33,458 --> 01:27:36,634
- Wake up at all.
- No.

834
01:27:37,768 --> 01:27:39,461
Nothing I can think of.

835
01:27:41,398 --> 01:27:43,358
I mean there was a little
thing about asking you to

836
01:27:43,383 --> 01:27:45,887
marry me but
aside from that, no.

837
01:27:45,887 --> 01:27:48,259
Don't mess with me like that.

838
01:27:48,599 --> 01:27:52,829
Huh. Who says I
mess with you?

839
01:27:54,466 --> 01:27:56,754
That better?

840
01:28:01,074 --> 01:28:02,564
I meant it.

841
01:28:04,021 --> 01:28:05,674
I want to marry you.

842
01:28:06,822 --> 01:28:08,462
Why?

843
01:28:09,552 --> 01:28:13,924
Because I want to spend every second
of the rest of my life with you.

844
01:28:20,768 --> 01:28:24,449
I don't expect you to say yes right away.

845
01:28:24,449 --> 01:28:26,614
I know I'm complicated.

846
01:28:28,680 --> 01:28:31,307
Just a little bit.

847
01:28:35,403 --> 01:28:39,319
You have an assistant?
I thought you were an assistant.

848
01:28:39,674 --> 01:28:42,332
Ah, it's a long story.
What's going on?

849
01:28:42,332 --> 01:28:44,732
It's a long story.
What's going on?

850
01:28:44,732 --> 01:28:48,444
The boy already has everything
except the sense of humor.

851
01:28:48,444 --> 01:28:52,967
Er.. his. His birthday.
When is his birthday?

852
01:28:52,967 --> 01:28:57,938
Sunday. He didn't tell you? He is so weird.
Mom and Dad is throwing him a party.

853
01:28:57,938 --> 01:29:01,027
- Didn't he just had a party?
- She's yours but he's his.

854
01:29:01,027 --> 01:29:05,453
That was a ball. This is just family,
friends, music, fireworks..

855
01:29:05,453 --> 01:29:08,830
nobody.
Hey, what about a tie?

856
01:29:09,634 --> 01:29:11,393
Christian has a lot of ties.

857
01:29:11,918 --> 01:29:15,674
- Socks, suspenders, throw me a bone here.
- And, oh.. god.

858
01:29:15,674 --> 01:29:16,914
Mia, I gotta go.

859
01:29:16,914 --> 01:29:20,313
Okay, okay.
But Sunday I'll hunt you down myself. Bye

860
01:29:23,866 --> 01:29:25,021
Perfect.

861
01:29:33,084 --> 01:29:36,258
- Do you have a gift-box?
- One second.

862
01:29:39,183 --> 01:29:40,409
Hey.

863
01:29:47,363 --> 01:29:50,181
Ms Steele.
How's your day?

864
01:29:50,602 --> 01:29:54,207
Looking up, Mr Grey.
Where's Taylor?

865
01:29:54,207 --> 01:29:56,116
He went to get my bag.

866
01:29:56,498 --> 01:29:58,285
Your bag?
Where you going?

867
01:29:58,573 --> 01:30:01,568
Ross and I have to go to
Portland for some meetings.

868
01:30:01,568 --> 01:30:04,992
I'll be back tomorrow night.

869
01:30:06,179 --> 01:30:08,153
When are you going to tell
me about your birthday?

870
01:30:10,507 --> 01:30:15,330
Your parents are throwing you a party.
Were we gonna just stay home?

871
01:30:15,726 --> 01:30:19,728
They do this every year.
Well yeah. Birthday.

872
01:30:21,606 --> 01:30:25,853
My arrival in the world isn't
something I feel like celebrating.

873
01:30:26,660 --> 01:30:29,218
I feel like celebrating it.

874
01:30:31,429 --> 01:30:34,317
Can't open it till the day of event.

875
01:30:34,976 --> 01:30:37,486
Then why give it to me now?

876
01:30:38,705 --> 01:30:40,716
Call it delayed gratification.

877
01:31:44,188 --> 01:31:47,174
Christian.
What is that?

878
01:31:49,571 --> 01:31:53,040
Oh my god.
Oh no.

879
01:31:58,564 --> 01:32:00,245
Christian.
What's going on?

880
01:32:00,245 --> 01:32:03,411
- Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!
- What's happening?

881
01:32:10,376 --> 01:32:12,426
Stop it.

882
01:32:12,426 --> 01:32:16,030
Hold tight.
Hold tight.

883
01:32:29,095 --> 01:32:32,951
- Hi.
- Oh my god, you're so tanned.

884
01:32:32,951 --> 01:32:33,591
Glowing.

885
01:32:33,591 --> 01:32:36,826
- Want a beer Anna?
- Yes please please.

886
01:32:37,192 --> 01:32:39,385
- Hi Jose.
- Hey.

887
01:32:39,385 --> 01:32:44,070
- How's it going?
- So, congratulations fiction editor.

888
01:32:44,070 --> 01:32:47,992
- Right. She's a big deal now.
- And how's your hottie?

889
01:32:48,572 --> 01:32:53,556
Christian is good.
He asked me to move in with him.

890
01:32:54,220 --> 01:32:57,514
- What?
- Anna is moving in with Christian.

891
01:32:57,514 --> 01:33:00,352
Oh that's great.
You know, We could use some privacy.

892
01:33:01,900 --> 01:33:04,584
You're so subtle.

893
01:33:06,190 --> 01:33:10,166
So you're serious but are you happy?
Cause that's all I care about.

894
01:33:10,166 --> 01:33:14,440
I.. I mean it's complicated
but I have never been happier.

895
01:33:14,440 --> 01:33:17,495
- Hey Mia, whassup?
- Did you hear about Jose's show?

896
01:33:17,495 --> 01:33:21,565
It was incredible. Really he was amazing.
He got rave review.

897
01:33:21,565 --> 01:33:24,109
- I gotta check it out.
- Wait wait Mia, slow down.

898
01:33:25,504 --> 01:33:27,719
Shit. Okay.
Yea, yeah Right away.

899
01:33:29,878 --> 01:33:32,889
Christian's chopper went missing
on the way back to Portland.

900
01:33:32,889 --> 01:33:35,177
They're setting up
search parties right now.

901
01:33:35,871 --> 01:33:37,833
Cmon, let's go.

902
01:33:38,602 --> 01:33:43,737
More on this breaking story is about from
field our reporter Rachel Taylor. Rachel.

903
01:33:43,737 --> 01:33:45,400
Thank you John.
I'm speaking to you live

904
01:33:45,400 --> 01:33:47,390
from the private helicopter
terminal at Seattle.

905
01:33:47,390 --> 01:33:50,746
They'll find him.
He'll be okay. It's Christian.

906
01:33:50,746 --> 01:33:52,192
Late this afternoon,

907
01:33:52,192 --> 01:33:55,419
the helicopter was an
Airbus helicopter H130.

908
01:33:55,419 --> 01:33:57,971
Is there anything we can do?

909
01:33:57,971 --> 01:34:01,880
And Christian only 27 years old
had extensive flying experience.

910
01:34:01,880 --> 01:34:02,638
Alright bye.

911
01:34:02,638 --> 01:34:04,888
One of Seattle's youngest
billionaire has grazed

912
01:34:04,888 --> 01:34:07,144
the charismatic head of
Grey enterprise holdings.

913
01:34:07,144 --> 01:34:09,787
a multi-national conglomerate..

914
01:34:09,787 --> 01:34:14,642
- Jesus. Would someone shut them up.
- No please.

915
01:34:14,642 --> 01:34:16,936
Just turn it down.
Okay. Thank you.

916
01:34:17,951 --> 01:34:21,359
You're shivering.
I'll get you a sweater. Okay.

917
01:34:26,163 --> 01:34:28,516
Anna.
Tea.

918
01:34:33,118 --> 01:34:36,890
He's gonna be fine.
He has to be okay.

919
01:34:40,233 --> 01:34:42,516
We haven't had any time.

920
01:34:43,311 --> 01:34:45,990
We need to have more time.

921
01:34:46,589 --> 01:34:49,473
You will have plenty of time.

922
01:34:51,252 --> 01:34:56,011
We're still glad that you're here with us.
And in Christian's life.

923
01:34:57,480 --> 01:35:00,218
You've made such a difference to him.

924
01:35:02,177 --> 01:35:04,739
He never let anyone get..

925
01:35:05,204 --> 01:35:08,434
close. Until
you came along.

926
01:35:10,690 --> 01:35:13,399
Grace. He
adores you.

927
01:35:13,399 --> 01:35:17,480
I know. But children grown out
of their parents and thats..

928
01:35:17,480 --> 01:35:21,061
that's fine.
As long as they're happy.

929
01:35:21,831 --> 01:35:27,918
And he.. is happy..
with you.

930
01:35:28,327 --> 01:35:31,207
And that's all I ever wanted.

931
01:35:31,207 --> 01:35:32,284
Turn it up.

932
01:35:32,284 --> 01:35:35,188
That Christian Grey and
his colleague Ros Bailey

933
01:35:35,188 --> 01:35:39,996
have been found safe and well and at
this moment on their way back to Seattle.

934
01:35:42,049 --> 01:35:43,566
What the hell y'all doing here?

935
01:35:43,566 --> 01:35:46,190
Christian. Oh my god.
Christian..how did you get here?

936
01:35:49,188 --> 01:35:53,557
What happened, Oh my god.
Why didn't you call?

937
01:35:53,557 --> 01:35:57,077
I had an accident.
I lost my phone.

938
01:35:57,077 --> 01:36:00,154
I'm fine.
Ros is fine.

939
01:36:00,542 --> 01:36:04,357
<i>He's here, he just walked in.
He looks like shit but he is in one piece</i>

940
01:36:06,420 --> 01:36:08,535
Guys, relax. I'm fine. Okay.

941
01:36:10,896 --> 01:36:12,663
Let me say hi to my girl.

942
01:36:12,663 --> 01:36:15,166
Come on mom.

943
01:36:18,727 --> 01:36:20,760
Miss me?

944
01:36:35,817 --> 01:36:38,368
I thought...
Hey..hey..

945
01:36:38,368 --> 01:36:39,208
Sorry..

946
01:36:40,875 --> 01:36:44,709
I was so scared...
So scared.

947
01:36:48,507 --> 01:36:50,988
I thought I lost you forever.

948
01:36:51,224 --> 01:36:55,030
Not a chance.
I'm here.

949
01:37:05,837 --> 01:37:07,995
Careful..
No.

950
01:37:08,726 --> 01:37:11,604
Mom.
Okay..

951
01:37:13,164 --> 01:37:15,446
We'll see you tomorrow.
Good night.

952
01:37:22,070 --> 01:37:25,890
It's after midnight.
I'm not tired.

953
01:37:26,238 --> 01:37:29,837
No, it's your birthday.

954
01:37:32,040 --> 01:37:34,096
Yeah.

955
01:37:34,672 --> 01:37:39,103
Happy birthday.
Thank you.

956
01:37:42,345 --> 01:37:45,123
Do you still have the gift I gave you?

957
01:37:59,226 --> 01:38:01,035
You know you don't have to.

958
01:38:02,081 --> 01:38:03,831
All I want is you.

959
01:38:04,167 --> 01:38:06,578
Just open it.
Okay.

960
01:38:13,397 --> 01:38:17,066
A key chain.
Turn it over.

961
01:38:26,270 --> 01:38:28,882
This is meant, Yes Yes?

962
01:38:29,274 --> 01:38:30,413
Yes.

963
01:38:30,621 --> 01:38:32,345
Yes Yes Yes.

964
01:38:41,284 --> 01:38:44,238
So this whole time I had
the answer in my pocket?

965
01:38:45,904 --> 01:38:50,325
Anastasia Steele.
What am I gonna do with you?

966
01:39:22,473 --> 01:39:27,418
Take me...to the Red house.
Take me.. take me to the red house.

967
01:39:28,334 --> 01:39:30,203
Are you sure?
Yes.

968
01:42:18,143 --> 01:42:19,228
Hi.

969
01:42:21,448 --> 01:42:23,731
Champagne, Mr. Grey?
Thanks.

970
01:42:23,731 --> 01:42:27,011
And can I just say happy birthday?

971
01:42:27,631 --> 01:42:29,710
Sure, thank you.

972
01:42:32,808 --> 01:42:34,975
Christian. Mom..

973
01:42:34,975 --> 01:42:37,195
Happy Birthday.
Thank you.

974
01:42:37,699 --> 01:42:40,733
And Anna,
so good to see you again.

975
01:42:40,993 --> 01:42:44,389
You saw us last night.
Yes.

976
01:42:44,697 --> 01:42:48,732
And because of that I'm never
taking anything for granted.

977
01:42:48,732 --> 01:42:50,238
Ever again.

978
01:42:50,486 --> 01:42:54,022
Hey, I heard about the crash.
Are you okay?

979
01:42:54,022 --> 01:42:55,654
I'm fine, Elena, thank you.

980
01:42:56,302 --> 01:43:00,714
Anna, let me introduce to you
my good friend Elena Lincoln.

981
01:43:01,025 --> 01:43:03,748
We met at the masquerade.
Yes..

982
01:43:04,183 --> 01:43:06,158
Nice to see you again.

983
01:43:07,606 --> 01:43:09,833
Excuse us.
Surely.

984
01:43:09,833 --> 01:43:12,522
She's fantastic.

985
01:43:19,944 --> 01:43:22,997
Ladies and gentlemen, Mia..

986
01:43:24,446 --> 01:43:27,333
I wanna thank you all for
coming here this evening.

987
01:43:27,333 --> 01:43:30,361
I was expecting small family gathering,
Thanks Mia..

988
01:43:30,361 --> 01:43:34,613
But I'm happy that you're all here.
Because I have an announcement to make.

989
01:43:35,150 --> 01:43:39,918
As most of you know.
Yesterday Ros and I had a narrow escape.

990
01:43:40,882 --> 01:43:44,841
And something like that,
Reminds us of what really matters.

991
01:43:44,841 --> 01:43:48,570
And how important it is to seize the day.

992
01:43:48,570 --> 01:43:52,113
Anna, come up here a second, please.

993
01:44:01,375 --> 01:44:05,719
So a while ago I was looking up
to meet this amazing young woman..

994
01:44:05,744 --> 01:44:07,381
Anastasia Steele.

995
01:44:07,406 --> 01:44:09,817
Very quickly I realized
that she was the one,

996
01:44:09,842 --> 01:44:11,888
I wanted to share my life with.

997
01:44:12,092 --> 01:44:15,050
So I asked her to marry me.

998
01:44:15,050 --> 01:44:16,810
And she said yes.

999
01:44:19,260 --> 01:44:21,052
So good.

1000
01:44:33,234 --> 01:44:36,182
Welcome to the family.
Thank you.

1001
01:44:36,182 --> 01:44:39,660
I wouldn't meet my client anymore.
I would just rehydrate.

1002
01:44:39,660 --> 01:44:42,082
Oh My God, don't do that.
Congratulations.

1003
01:44:42,082 --> 01:44:45,974
Hi, mom.
I love you.

1004
01:44:47,687 --> 01:44:50,203
Well done, big brother.

1005
01:44:50,412 --> 01:44:52,853
Ring! Show me the ring.

1006
01:44:53,155 --> 01:44:54,900
We're gonna choose it together.

1007
01:44:54,900 --> 01:44:55,901
No rock?

1008
01:44:55,926 --> 01:45:00,134
...Christian Grey.
Oh my god! I have a sister.

1009
01:45:12,664 --> 01:45:15,601
Leave you alone for a couple of
weeks and this is what happens?

1010
01:45:15,601 --> 01:45:18,235
I know, I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

1011
01:45:18,235 --> 01:45:20,193
Oh please.
Come here.

1012
01:45:22,152 --> 01:45:23,988
So how does it feel to

1013
01:45:24,018 --> 01:45:26,606
Seattle most eligible bachelor?

1014
01:45:26,606 --> 01:45:30,297
It's a little scary but...
If anyone can make it work, it's you.

1015
01:45:30,830 --> 01:45:33,108
Hey, sis-in-law.

1016
01:45:33,108 --> 01:45:37,080
Congratulations.
Christian's a very lucky guy.

1017
01:45:37,080 --> 01:45:40,393
...You however are certified

1018
01:45:41,178 --> 01:45:44,573
Sorry to interrupt, Mia wants to
taste one of your killer cocktails.

1019
01:45:44,573 --> 01:45:45,786
Oh, coming right up.

1020
01:45:47,868 --> 01:45:50,355
Nice to see you heat it on our little talk.

1021
01:45:56,414 --> 01:45:58,903
What makes you think that I
would ever listen to you?

1022
01:45:58,903 --> 01:46:00,464
You don't care about Christian.

1023
01:46:00,464 --> 01:46:03,833
he will see to that.
I'll make sure of it.

1024
01:46:03,833 --> 01:46:08,674
He'll see right through you.
It's over for you... Elena.

1025
01:46:08,674 --> 01:46:11,944
You're just a mousy little
thing after his money.

1026
01:46:11,944 --> 01:46:14,822
He's not capable of marriage.

1027
01:46:21,050 --> 01:46:22,734
Thank you, Christian.

1028
01:46:22,734 --> 01:46:24,998
Why're you even here Elena?

1029
01:46:25,903 --> 01:46:29,022
She's not right for you.
You don't know what's right for me.

1030
01:46:29,145 --> 01:46:31,298
You tell me how to fuck Elena.

1031
01:46:31,565 --> 01:46:33,526
Anna tell me how to love.

1032
01:46:33,526 --> 01:46:35,535
She's just the next one in line.

1033
01:46:35,535 --> 01:46:38,191
Get out of my house.

1034
01:46:42,410 --> 01:46:45,777
Leave my children alone and
get the hell out of my house.

1035
01:46:58,672 --> 01:47:00,046
...Anna, darling.

1036
01:47:02,777 --> 01:47:05,195
Would you give us a moment alone please?

1037
01:47:34,594 --> 01:47:36,430
I'm sorry about that.

1038
01:47:39,947 --> 01:47:41,852
Is your Mom okay?

1039
01:47:42,345 --> 01:47:44,289
Sure is..

1040
01:47:44,929 --> 01:47:48,940
Elena's gone.
Like gone gone?

1041
01:47:48,965 --> 01:47:52,312
I'm done.
The business, everything..

1042
01:47:52,312 --> 01:47:55,651
I'll have my people sort
out the details tomorrow.

1043
01:47:57,228 --> 01:48:01,580
I know she was important to you.
I'm sorry.

1044
01:48:04,057 --> 01:48:05,898
Are you?
No... No.

1045
01:48:09,637 --> 01:48:11,634
What's that you got there?

1046
01:48:25,543 --> 01:48:28,415
Come with me.
There is something I need to show you.

1047
01:48:32,173 --> 01:48:34,958
Last time we came down here.
I was over your shoulder.

1048
01:48:35,698 --> 01:48:37,015
Oh yeah.

1049
01:48:53,818 --> 01:48:55,557
After you.

1050
01:49:07,329 --> 01:49:09,395
Oh my God!

1051
01:49:09,395 --> 01:49:13,478
- You want a bunch of flowers?
- Oh my God!

1052
01:49:13,478 --> 01:49:15,965
It's ok.
It's ok.

1053
01:49:21,879 --> 01:49:23,299
...Christian.

1054
01:49:25,999 --> 01:49:28,275
This is amazing.

1055
01:49:34,934 --> 01:49:35,894
Be mine.

1056
01:49:37,845 --> 01:49:40,307
Share my life with me.

1057
01:49:41,120 --> 01:49:42,120
Yes.

1058
01:49:43,077 --> 01:49:44,993
Marry me.

1059
01:49:47,584 --> 01:49:49,146
Oh baby.

1060
01:49:49,741 --> 01:49:51,465
Alright.

1061
01:50:06,343 --> 01:50:08,260
Did you do that?

1062
01:50:23,484 --> 01:50:25,958
It's so pretty.
Oh!

1063
01:51:15,575 --> 01:51:17,134

1064
