33
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:31,275
Man: Okay, now--
now it's time for some bowling.

34
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:32,651
- All right.

35
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,736
Come on. You know what?
lf you're not gonna take this seriously

36
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:37,614
and hit down the pin, just sit down
and let the real bowlers bowl.

37
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:39,533
You know what it is?
You're supposed to look at the triangle.

38
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:40,868
- Let's see, let's see.
- That's where you're supposed to look.

39
00:02:41,035 --> 00:02:42,202
- Let's see what you got.
- Okay, just keep your eye on me.

40
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:43,370
You're gonna see this.

41
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:44,538
- You watchin'? All right, here we go.
- l'm watchin'.

42
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:52,754
- Oh yeah! Nice!
- Man: Oh!

43
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:54,548
That's how it's done! See that?
Were you watching?

44
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:56,967
- All right, l saw it.
- lt's all about technique.

45
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:59,928
As a matter of fact, l'm so confident
l can knock that one down,

46
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:03,432
l got a solid Franklin here
says l clear that frame.

47
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,100
- Copy that.
- Why don't you put your money

48
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:06,435
- where your mouth is?
- l got that.

49
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:08,020
- Now it gets interesting.
- Right there.

50
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:10,105
Yeah! Watch, don't take
your eyes off me.

51
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:13,317
All l need is my lucky ball here.
l got my lucky ball.

52
00:03:13,484 --> 00:03:15,652
All right, we're gonna
make this happen.

53
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:18,405
Where you going? Look at this guy
going to the bathroom again.

54
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:20,282
You incontinent old man.

55
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:23,285
All right, here we go again, fellas.
You ready?

56
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:14,628
Okay, you guys tell me
we're gonna make this happen.

57
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:17,047
lt's me and my ball.
lt's me and my lucky ball.

58
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:18,924
ln my universe,
it's me and my crystal ball.

59
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:20,884
Looking in my ball,
you know what l see in my future?

60
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:22,219
A spare.
Watch.

61
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:23,720
l'll teach ya how to do this
a little bit later on, all right?

62
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:26,473
Pay attention.
Hey, you guys keep it down.

63
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:28,308
l'm tryin' to bowl over here.

64
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:31,645
No respect, l tell you.
These guys. Okay.

65
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:40,487
Oh! All day long!
l'm just gonna--

66
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:50,247
How you doing, Luis?

67
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:52,457
You got something for me?

68
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,293
l told Big Doug l'd have it,
l'll have it.

70
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,478
l want you to think very carefully
about your next move, Luis.

71
00:05:16,357 --> 00:05:18,608
l don't think so, buddy.

72
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:29,453
Walt, you gotta
let me outta here.

73
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,246
Come on, you know me.
l'm a regular here, l'll be back.

74
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:33,957
But those are my shoes.

75
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:37,044
Hey.

76
00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:55,228
Word to the wise, brother.

77
00:05:55,396 --> 00:05:57,522
Stay down.

78
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:00,317
You'll get your shoes back.
You know me.

79
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:01,485
You don't know these guys.

80
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:02,778
- Please, you'll get them back.
- Tommy needs ya,

81
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:05,489
- Tommy's gonna get ya.
- l'm a regular here--

82
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:08,575
- Hey, l'll take an 11.
- Tommy, l'm sorry.

83
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:11,453
l was gonna pay ya, Tommy.
Tommy, l'm gonna pay.

84
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:14,122
l'm sorry. Ah!
l'm sorry, Tommy.

85
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:15,999
l was gonna pay!
l swear, l was gonna--

86
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:19,544
This ain't right!
lt ain't fair!

87
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:22,756
Oh, it ain't right?
lt ain't fair?

88
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:25,550
l gave you a 10-day extension.
That's more than fair.

89
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:29,262
But me having to track
your little ass down, that ain't right.

90
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:31,139
Look, you can't
just come in here and--

91
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:33,517
Yeah, l can, Luis,
because this is what l do.

92
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:35,519
This is my job.

93
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:37,020
Let me break it down
for you, dumbass.

94
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:40,982
lf you borrow from Big Doug
and pay him back, l got no play in that.

95
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:43,485
But when you borrow
from Big Doug...

96
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:48,031
- Don't! Please!
- ...and don't pay him back?

97
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:50,659
He shoots, he loses.

98
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:57,124
Please, Tommy!

99
00:06:57,291 --> 00:07:01,211
- Big Doug says me and Julio--
- Tommy, Tommy, please.

100
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:03,380
Don't!

101
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:08,718
- l'm sorry!
- l was generous with you, Luis,

102
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:11,138
seeing we only earn base
plus a cut of the vig.

103
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:14,975
Meaning the less the vig,
the less money for me and Julio here.

104
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:17,144
And that ain't right.

105
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:21,731
- Luis: l'm sorry, Tommy!
- Be careful, Tommy.

106
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:28,572
- Ain't fair.
- Okay, l'm sorry, Tommy.

107
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:31,324
- You got my money?
- Maybe, maybe!

108
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:36,788
Luis, ain't nothing's ever
been accomplished with a maybe.

109
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,500
Come on, Tommy!
This is crazy!

110
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:44,588
Okay, l get it!
l get the point, Tommy!

113
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:52,429
You got two choices.

114
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:55,682
You either pay Big Doug the money
you owe him in the next 24 hours

115
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:58,018
or you run and you hide.

116
00:07:58,186 --> 00:08:01,062
Because next time, we ain't
gonna be so easy on your ass.

117
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:07,861
Smile.

119
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:20,832
Julio: Last time l had
a blood test was at the VA

120
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,876
when l was shipped home
from lraq.

121
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:28,089
Seriously though, who knew a job
like this came with health insurance?

122
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:31,968
When boss wants us
to get a physical, we get a physical.

123
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:37,265
Tommy Conolan?
The doctor will see you now.

124
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,521
Okay, you know the drill.

125
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:45,148
Clothes off, gown on,
and the doctor will be in in a bit.

126
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:09,089
Still here, old man.

127
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:11,341
Still here.

129
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:27,732
What's happening, boss?

130
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,443
Tommy.
Usual?

131
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:32,487
Sure.

132
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:39,035
- How's the wife?
- She's good.

133
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:42,914
- Real good.
- That girl deserves some credit

134
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:45,375
- for putting up with you, Tommy.
- Tell me about it.

135
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:47,335
Well, here we go.

136
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,848
All right, hit me.

137
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:02,726
Allan Brady, paid in full.

138
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:05,395
His eldest still in Afghanistan?

139
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:08,690
Yeah, sure is.
Army, Fourth lnfantry Brigade.

140
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:11,443
- Good kid.
- Combat team, eh?

141
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:14,070
Yeah.

142
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:17,991
That's your old company,
isn't it?

143
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:22,120
Yeah, a long time ago.

144
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:29,210
Nick Bradley,
paid in full.

145
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:33,089
Speaking of the ungrateful.
You hear from Luis?

146
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:35,759
Funny you should
mention that.

147
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:38,928
Just had a real nice talk
with that young man.

148
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:41,097
Hm. That's what l heard.

149
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:46,561
Think he'll pay?

150
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:51,775
lf he's smart, he will.

151
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:55,612
lf he was smart, he never would have
borrowed from me in the first place.

152
00:11:01,952 --> 00:11:04,204
How's Eddie?

153
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:08,083
Good as he can be.

154
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,502
They just transferred him
to the state pen.

155
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:15,131
Tommy, l know you
and the wife will be hurtin',

156
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:18,301
workin' hard to cover
Eddie's ass like this,

157
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:21,304
but is he worth it?

158
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:25,308
Well, no, he's not worth it,
but he's my little brother.

159
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:30,647
l hear ya.
l got one of those myself.

160
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:34,818
But Eddie stole from me.

161
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:37,487
l can't simply erase
debt like that.

162
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:39,030
l know, Doug, l know.

163
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:42,200
- l got it covered.
- Bartender: What'll you have?

164
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:45,328
Doug:
That you do.

165
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:48,164
Something's come up this week
to change that.

166
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:52,460
l need a package delivered
to the German.

167
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:54,713
l know some decades back,

168
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,132
the two of you
worked in the same crew.

169
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:00,176
What happened?

170
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,805
Just difference of opinion.

171
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:06,599
He and Nicky still at war
with Anthony?

172
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:08,810
Three angry dogs.

173
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:11,354
One miserable junkyard
to fight over.

174
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:13,648
And your money's
on the German.

175
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:15,775
Mm-hmm.

176
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:18,820
lt's that important to you?

177
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:21,156
lt is.

178
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:23,700
Enough so
that if you do this for me,

179
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:26,661
l will wipe clean
your brother's debt.

180
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:31,541
All right. Last l heard,
he was still based out of BC.

181
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:35,962
Wise decision, Tommy.

182
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:42,886
What's in it?

183
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:46,264
You're being paid not to know.

184
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,769
That's for expenses.

185
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:12,290
- See you in a couple days, boss.
- Godspeed.

186
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:22,258
- Hey.
- Smart move, kid.

188
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:32,227
- Man on phone: Yes?
- The package is en route.

189
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:35,605
Excellent.

190
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:52,455
Man: lt's not like l'm really being
unreasonable here, is it now?

191
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:54,791
lt's not like l like the sound
of my own voice

192
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,376
and that's the reason
l'm talking to you.

193
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:58,920
lt's because this needs
to be done.

194
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:02,131
And spend some money. Try to
improve your look, for God's sake.

195
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:03,800
Jesus.

196
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:06,928
l don't know what you guys
do around here all the time.

197
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:09,722
When's this asshole gonna get here?

198
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:15,645
Well.

199
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:21,901
All right, here he comes.
On my go.

201
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:38,167
Nicolas.

202
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:40,795
German.

203
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:44,007
You wouldn't know
anything about

204
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:46,509
a missing silver shipment,
now would you?

205
00:14:48,762 --> 00:14:50,555
Because, you see,

206
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:54,684
l intended to take
that shipment myself.

207
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:57,103
Sure.

208
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:59,314
Sure l do.

209
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:03,359
Guys.

211
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:15,371
Cute.

212
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:17,665
So tell me.

213
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:20,376
Where do we stand,

214
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:21,961
you and l?

215
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:25,465
How do you mean?

216
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:29,677
Are we friends, enemies,

217
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:31,804
or simply competitors?

218
00:15:31,972 --> 00:15:34,432
No different than
a pair of hardware stores

219
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,311
struggling to survive
in the same damn town.

220
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,859
Well...

221
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:47,946
l wouldn't find it wise
for me to answer that.

223
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:56,871
And yet therein lies
your answer.

224
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:05,964
l suppose it does.

225
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:08,591
How do you think that this,

226
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:11,386
the you and l of it all,

227
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:14,263
will play out in the long run?

228
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,893
Poorly.

229
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:21,980
Agreed.

230
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:26,109
But in the meantime,
we're at peace.

231
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:28,528
Peace is the only thing
any of us wants.

232
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:30,697
ls that so?

233
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:33,574
lt is for now.

234
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:42,625
How long have
we been doing this?

235
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:45,962
Too long.

236
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:50,508
And yet the years
just keep on coming.

237
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:57,306
You keep to yours,

238
00:16:57,474 --> 00:17:00,101
l'll keep to mine.

239
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:04,480
lf either dips
his finger knowingly

240
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:08,651
or unknowingly
into the other's till,

241
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:12,739
we don't cut it off.

242
00:17:12,906 --> 00:17:14,949
We meet as such

243
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:17,285
and we play it cool.

244
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:21,330
Agreed.

245
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:24,542
As for the silver,

246
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:28,629
l'll overlook
that little indiscretion.

247
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:32,800
Well, that's too kind.

249
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:40,183
You are a son of a bitch.
You know that?

251
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:45,271
You hungry?

252
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:48,024
l could eat.

253
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:50,818
l will have a word
with the chef.

254
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:54,072
The guy is a real maestro.

255
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:11,798
Go. Go!

256
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:02,765
Come on!
What are you waiting for?

257
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:05,518
Get out there, God damn it!
Move!

258
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:07,979
Go on! Jesus!

259
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:09,856
Shit.

261
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:13,669
This wasn't what
you expected, was it?

266
00:22:28,221 --> 00:22:30,014
What's the word, bro?

267
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:33,559
Word is, l got something
to clear your slate with Big Doug.

268
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:38,314
That ain't your cross to bear.

269
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:42,610
Hey, we're family.

270
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:44,820
You'd do the same for me
if the shoe was on the other foot.

271
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:50,159
l don't know, Tommy.

272
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:52,453
l just don't know
if l'd even care.

273
00:22:58,168 --> 00:22:59,960
Look, why are you here today?

274
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:04,131
Huh? What do you want from me?
You want me to say thank you?

275
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:06,175
Look where the hell
l'm at, Tommy.

276
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:11,180
- Thought you'd want to know.
- Well, l don't want to know.

277
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:14,266
And you know why?

278
00:23:14,434 --> 00:23:17,103
Because l'm in here
with a bunch of Big Doug's friends

279
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:19,355
and that's on me.

280
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:21,649
And if you go out there

281
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:23,484
and do that for me
and things go sour?

282
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:25,611
Well, that's on me, too.

283
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:28,030
l don't want that.

284
00:23:33,703 --> 00:23:36,872
Tommy.

285
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,916
l just--

286
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:41,710
take care of yourself, bro.

287
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:45,256
Yeah.

288
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:54,682
Guard.

290
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:35,973
You scared me.

291
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:43,063
- You smell good.
- Yeah?

292
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:47,693
How about losing the towel?

293
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:50,279
But then l'd be naked.

294
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:54,158
- Still have these on.
- Mm. Mm-hmm.

297
00:25:15,805 --> 00:25:17,973
Hey, Tommy?

298
00:25:18,141 --> 00:25:20,100
Yeah.

299
00:25:20,268 --> 00:25:23,646
What would you do if something
wonderful happened?

300
00:25:25,148 --> 00:25:28,484
Some kind of miracle
and all of a sudden

301
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:31,153
we had all the money
we needed,

302
00:25:31,321 --> 00:25:34,823
and you didn't have
to work for Big Doug?

303
00:25:34,991 --> 00:25:37,576
What would you do?
Where would you take me?

304
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:42,581
l don't know.

305
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:46,085
Thinking like that
can get you into trouble.

306
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,928
Did you think about
what we talked about?

307
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:58,264
About your work?

308
00:26:00,016 --> 00:26:01,934
Yeah, l looked into it.

309
00:26:03,436 --> 00:26:05,521
And?

310
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:14,113
And l'm not gonna make
the money Big Doug pays me

311
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:16,949
working as a bouncer.

312
00:26:20,453 --> 00:26:21,954
So if Big Doug's so fair,

313
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:24,582
why does he keep
a loaded shotgun under his table?

314
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:26,709
Who does that?

315
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:31,505
Darla, there's not a great demand
for my skills in your world.

316
00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:36,051
And then Eddie's debt.

317
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:49,898
Tell me you love me.

318
00:26:50,066 --> 00:26:52,735
How come you don't say it?

319
00:26:54,195 --> 00:26:55,946
'Cause you know
how l feel about you.

320
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:58,407
Then l'm the luckiest girl
in the world

321
00:26:58,575 --> 00:27:01,410
and l have everything l need.

323
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:17,051
Tommy:
What you got?

324
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:19,303
About the only thing they make
that's good here.

325
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:21,680
- Coffee.
- Thank you, sir.

326
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:25,017
And a breakfast burrito.
Chef's special.

327
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:28,604
- How special?
- lt won't kill you.

328
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:30,773
We'll see about that.

329
00:27:36,571 --> 00:27:38,530
Where's the package?

330
00:27:41,117 --> 00:27:43,827
- Seriously?
- As a heart attack.

331
00:27:45,872 --> 00:27:47,164
Why didn't he just mail it?

332
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:49,500
You got me.

333
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:51,293
Do you have any idea
what's in it?

334
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:53,462
No, and l'd rather
keep it that way.

335
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:55,589
Oh, you'd rather
keep it that way.

336
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:01,428
You, me, the open road.
Good times.

337
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:10,062
How's it going with Darla?

338
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:13,273
She still on ya to quit the job?

339
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:16,777
Eh, she worries a lot.
She's looking out for me.

340
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:22,199
She's a good woman, Tommy.

341
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:24,660
She deserves all the respect
you give her.

342
00:28:25,995 --> 00:28:27,830
That she does, man.
That she does.

343
00:28:35,004 --> 00:28:37,047
- Hey, man.
- What?

344
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:39,717
- Stop.
- Come on, man.

345
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:41,635
l just want to see
what all the fuss is about.

346
00:28:41,803 --> 00:28:44,680
Yeah, well, l'd rather not see
what all the fuss is about.

347
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:47,349
You know what l'm saying?

348
00:28:47,517 --> 00:28:49,518
Fine.

349
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:51,645
Hey, man.
Don't say l didn't warn you.

350
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:55,941
Hey.

351
00:29:18,631 --> 00:29:20,632
What?

352
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:56,251
Find it.

354
00:30:05,678 --> 00:30:07,179
Get the hell out of here, son.

355
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:10,682
He's in the store.
You know the drill.

356
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:12,726
Ralph, you take the wheel.
We get the item, we go.

357
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:14,937
Monique, work the scanners.
You hear anything, let me know.

358
00:30:15,104 --> 00:30:16,897
State, local police, anyone--
we're history. Understand?

359
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:19,066
Jake, Dosan, follow me.

360
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:22,444
Get out.

361
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:50,180
Devon, we've got a call in
on the local sheriff's line.

362
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:53,517
They're sending an emergency team.
Five-to-seven minutes out max.

363
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:55,477
Copy that.
Keep the engine running.

364
00:30:55,645 --> 00:30:58,605
And don't use names over the radio.
You know better than that.

365
00:30:58,773 --> 00:31:00,566
Come on, man.
Come on.

366
00:31:14,455 --> 00:31:17,666
Come on out, Tommy.
We're not here to hurt you.

367
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:19,626
We just want the package.

370
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:36,244
You wanna dance with me,
little girl?

371
00:33:22,917 --> 00:33:24,167
What's happening in there?

372
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:25,836
This place is gonna be
cop central any minute.

373
00:33:29,298 --> 00:33:30,799
Ain't gonna take
too much longer.

374
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:33,343
Just keep that engine running,
l'm bringing dinner home.

375
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:53,655
Devon? Jake?

376
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:55,699
Dosan, come in.

377
00:34:02,415 --> 00:34:05,500
- Hey, where are you going?
- Taking care of business.

378
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:21,493
Jesus Christ, Ralph!
You almost killed me!

379
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:24,371
How the hell did this thing suddenly
get so goddamn complicated?

380
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:25,997
- Ralph: l did what l had to do.
- You alerted the whole town

381
00:35:26,165 --> 00:35:27,749
to our presence.
That's what you did.

382
00:35:27,917 --> 00:35:29,876
Get in the van.
We have to find that package.

383
00:35:30,044 --> 00:35:31,586
Ralph:
Cops are on their way.

384
00:35:33,422 --> 00:35:35,632
Now! We've got to go!
Come on!

385
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:47,811
Where's Dosan?

386
00:35:49,605 --> 00:35:51,773
Dosan's dead.
So is Jake.

387
00:35:51,941 --> 00:35:54,401
Wasn't supposed to go down like this.

388
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:57,070
We were told this guy
is a goddamn goon.

389
00:35:57,238 --> 00:35:58,947
A low-level nobody.
A nightclub bouncer.

390
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:01,199
We got soft on the idea
and it's our fault.

391
00:36:01,367 --> 00:36:04,619
Whatever this thing is worth,
it's already cost us two lives.

392
00:36:04,787 --> 00:36:07,080
Let's sharpen it up
and get that package.

393
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:10,959
Ralph, circle back.

394
00:36:11,127 --> 00:36:13,545
He went to that gas station.

395
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:16,590
We'll get him.

396
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:37,652
What the hell?

397
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:15,190
l've chased Taliban
insurgents in Kabul,

398
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:16,858
hunted war criminals
in Serbia,

399
00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:19,319
and here l am
in a rotten old gas station

400
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:22,530
in the middle of Hicksville,
Washington, US of A,

401
00:37:22,698 --> 00:37:26,534
chasing an ex-nightclub bouncer-
turned-errand boy.

402
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:45,428
Who else has seen this footage?

403
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:47,889
The police.

404
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:49,724
The police were here.

405
00:37:49,892 --> 00:37:52,644
l told them
the same thing l told you.

406
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:58,650
Well, that doesn't help me at all.

410
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:41,276
- Yes?
- Devon: We lost him.

411
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:48,283
- Come again?
- l said we lost him.

412
00:38:53,622 --> 00:38:57,417
- Meaning?
- Meaning this guy,

413
00:38:57,585 --> 00:39:00,670
we were misinformed
as to his capabilities.

414
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:04,841
How do you want us
to proceed?

415
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:08,845
Proceed how you see fit.

416
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:11,598
Your fee, however,
is now up for grabs.

417
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:14,351
Look, you can't just turn things
around on me now

418
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:16,811
- and start--
- Yes, l can.

419
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:21,024
l'm now offering the bounty up
to anyone in my crew.

420
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:23,443
- Anthony, l lost--
- Screwed up!

421
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:27,280
Say it.

422
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:31,743
Yeah, l screwed up.

423
00:39:34,663 --> 00:39:37,874
Let me put it to you
as simply as l can.

424
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:41,252
We are at war

425
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:43,213
with the German.

426
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:45,632
The German
has paid a serious

427
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,175
amount of money
for this package.

428
00:39:47,343 --> 00:39:49,594
lf l can get to it
before it gets to him,

429
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:51,721
then l'll have
negotiating power.

430
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:55,683
Power is everything.

431
00:39:57,186 --> 00:39:59,479
Do l make myself clear?

432
00:40:00,981 --> 00:40:02,190
Yes, sir.

433
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:04,025
Now go do whatever it takes

434
00:40:04,193 --> 00:40:06,569
to get that goddamn package.

436
00:40:12,118 --> 00:40:13,952
Ex-military contractors,
my ass.

437
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,579
Next time, l hire Sal
and his union enforcers.

438
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:27,215
You still got that picture
of the courier?

439
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:29,926
- Yes, sir.
- You don't cross me either.

440
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:31,845
You better be right about this.

441
00:40:32,012 --> 00:40:33,555
Whatever it is,
it's serious enough

442
00:40:33,722 --> 00:40:35,390
to clear this guy's whole tab
just for delivering.

443
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:37,559
lt's something big, boss.
l know it.

444
00:40:37,726 --> 00:40:39,727
Get it out there.
Send it out on the street.

445
00:40:39,895 --> 00:40:41,729
On the street, boss?

446
00:40:41,897 --> 00:40:44,983
l want every informant,
stool pigeon, rat fink,

447
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:48,236
lowlife, ex-con, crackhead
looking for him.

448
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:51,239
And when they find him,
which they will,

449
00:40:51,407 --> 00:40:53,408
- l want you there.
- Yes, sir.

450
00:40:55,744 --> 00:40:57,412
What is this?

451
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:58,913
lt's his whole life.

452
00:40:59,081 --> 00:41:01,791
Military records,
DMV information.

453
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:03,835
Every parking ticket citation
and credit card

454
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:06,004
this guy ever applied for.

455
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:07,589
l got you everything on him.

456
00:41:07,756 --> 00:41:09,924
You don't cross Luis Ramirez.

457
00:41:12,178 --> 00:41:14,012
Tough guy, huh?

458
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:16,598
- You got this?
- Yes, sir.

460
00:41:26,692 --> 00:41:28,651
Well, that's good to hear.

461
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:33,781
The funds have been processed
and will be wired upon receipt.

462
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:36,409
And, Doug?

463
00:41:36,577 --> 00:41:38,077
Thank you.

465
00:41:47,963 --> 00:41:50,131
Oh, as l was saying,

466
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:53,760
mangos are the most popular
fruit on the planet

467
00:41:53,928 --> 00:41:57,972
and chock full of
vitamins A and C,

468
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:00,225
alongside a healthy dose
of antioxidants

469
00:42:00,392 --> 00:42:03,770
in the form of alpha-carotene,
beta-carotene,

470
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:07,440
and beta-cryptoxanthin.

471
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:10,610
The blueberries provide
damn near the same.

472
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:12,487
Not to mention,
the little bastards

473
00:42:12,655 --> 00:42:14,989
are tasty as hell.

474
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:21,579
Cucumbers for
magnesium, potassium.

475
00:42:22,831 --> 00:42:26,334
Bananas for protease inhibitors.

476
00:42:26,502 --> 00:42:29,170
Please, l'm dying.

477
00:42:30,297 --> 00:42:32,715
Grapes for resveratrol

478
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:36,594
and papayas

479
00:42:36,762 --> 00:42:40,098
for the folate.

480
00:42:41,141 --> 00:42:43,768
Please, man.
l'm dying here.

481
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:51,401
Now the vertebral column,

482
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:53,486
or spine as it were,

483
00:42:53,654 --> 00:42:58,491
is a column made out
of 24 articulated vertebrae.

484
00:42:58,659 --> 00:43:00,785
Three of which are crushed,

485
00:43:00,953 --> 00:43:03,204
meaning you'll
never walk again.

486
00:43:03,372 --> 00:43:07,208
Which isn't necessarily
a problem

487
00:43:07,376 --> 00:43:10,837
since l also ruptured
your spleen

488
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:13,381
and tore into your liver.

489
00:43:13,549 --> 00:43:18,219
ln essence, l gutted you...

490
00:43:18,387 --> 00:43:21,097
like a freshly caught mackerel.

491
00:43:23,517 --> 00:43:28,354
lt's a fish l quite enjoy, in fact.

492
00:43:28,522 --> 00:43:32,483
Pickled with butter on toast.

493
00:43:32,651 --> 00:43:34,902
Please.

494
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:37,405
Rye toast.

495
00:43:39,074 --> 00:43:41,534
So...

497
00:43:43,245 --> 00:43:46,080
Please.

498
00:43:46,248 --> 00:43:48,207
Tell me who sent you.

499
00:43:48,375 --> 00:43:51,586
Or what?
You gonna save me?

500
00:43:52,588 --> 00:43:55,506
You're gonna kill me anyway.

501
00:43:55,674 --> 00:43:59,302
No. There ain't
no saving you, son.

502
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:03,890
That's in the hands
of the Almighty alone.

503
00:44:05,517 --> 00:44:07,810
But if you don't tell me
who sent you,

504
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:10,563
well, l'm just gonna have to--

505
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:15,735
l'm gonna have to drive
myself over to...

506
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:23,242
1825 Del Cashan Street.

507
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:32,168
With a blowtorch,

508
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:35,213
five pounds of lye,
and some bolt cutters.

509
00:44:35,381 --> 00:44:38,007
And just--

510
00:44:38,175 --> 00:44:41,761
just do whatever l want to
to the inhabitants therein.

512
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:47,141
And believe me,
l'm both patient

513
00:44:47,309 --> 00:44:50,144
and creative.

514
00:44:54,233 --> 00:44:57,235
Anthony!
lt was Anthony!

515
00:45:06,912 --> 00:45:08,413
Well--

516
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:10,581
well, that's disappointing.

517
00:45:26,348 --> 00:45:29,350
Yes, Mr. Topasana.
Of course, we're gonna get you covered.

518
00:45:29,518 --> 00:45:32,103
1.4 in the Swiss account.

519
00:45:32,271 --> 00:45:34,230
The offshore account.
lt works every single time.

520
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:36,149
- You gotta trust me.
- Boss.

521
00:45:36,316 --> 00:45:39,026
- What now?
- lt's the German.

523
00:45:41,488 --> 00:45:42,739
l'll call you back.

524
00:45:42,906 --> 00:45:45,116
He's still alive.

525
00:45:45,284 --> 00:45:48,536
- And the men?
- He sent us a movie.

526
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:54,500
- A movie movie?
- A home movie.

530
00:46:35,876 --> 00:46:38,127
This guy's got
some kind of crazy skills

531
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:40,630
for someone
who's supposed to be sick.

532
00:46:43,509 --> 00:46:47,011
lt never troubles the wolf
how many the sheep may be.

533
00:46:49,598 --> 00:46:52,517
The time for negotiating is over.

534
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:55,645
You need that package badly,

535
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:58,397
but l'm gonna get to it first.

536
00:46:59,566 --> 00:47:02,151
And when
the time comes, German...

537
00:47:03,779 --> 00:47:06,155
l'm gonna cut your throat

538
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:08,699
and watch you bleed.

542
00:49:29,841 --> 00:49:32,969
The history of the martini
is an interesting one.

543
00:49:34,262 --> 00:49:35,888
One part vermouth,

544
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:38,307
four parts gin.

545
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:42,395
A twist of lemon

546
00:49:42,562 --> 00:49:44,438
or an olive.

547
00:49:47,859 --> 00:49:49,735
For garnish.

548
00:49:49,903 --> 00:49:51,904
Thank you.

549
00:49:57,160 --> 00:50:00,371
Mm.
Delicious.

550
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:03,082
Thank you.

551
00:50:05,085 --> 00:50:07,336
Well, shall we?

552
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:39,869
And the package?

554
00:50:46,251 --> 00:50:47,585
lt's en route.

555
00:50:49,921 --> 00:50:52,048
This will do very nicely.

556
00:50:52,215 --> 00:50:54,216
Excellent.

557
00:50:56,053 --> 00:51:00,556
l'll also be adding
a 5% monthly retainer.

558
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:03,517
You can keep the man
in black at bay

559
00:51:03,685 --> 00:51:05,478
for only so long.

561
00:51:59,616 --> 00:52:01,242
Hey, Doug, this is bull
and you know it.

562
00:52:01,409 --> 00:52:03,953
Doug: Everything we do carries with it
a little bit of excrement, Tommy.

563
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:05,621
You know that.

564
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:08,624
Tommy: Hey, man.
l don't like the feel of it.

565
00:52:08,792 --> 00:52:10,626
Send someone else.

566
00:52:10,794 --> 00:52:12,419
Doug:
l can't do that, Tommy.

567
00:52:12,587 --> 00:52:14,130
Tommy:
Man, l'll wait here and hand it off.

568
00:52:14,297 --> 00:52:15,923
Tommy.

569
00:52:16,091 --> 00:52:17,633
Look, it ain't like
l'm quitting on you, Doug.

570
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:19,093
- lt's just--
- Tommy.

571
00:52:22,013 --> 00:52:25,307
Son,

572
00:52:25,475 --> 00:52:27,643
outside of me,
for a man like you,

573
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:30,104
there is no other work.

574
00:52:31,439 --> 00:52:33,440
l can send someone else,
Tommy.

575
00:52:33,608 --> 00:52:38,195
l can, but you forfeit your pay.

576
00:52:38,363 --> 00:52:40,197
Yeah, no problem.

577
00:52:41,324 --> 00:52:43,492
But here's the way of it.

578
00:52:45,579 --> 00:52:48,164
Things have got so bad
for all of us,

579
00:52:49,916 --> 00:52:52,084
that over the course
of the next few weeks,

580
00:52:52,252 --> 00:52:55,921
your take-home pay
will probably be halved.

581
00:52:58,008 --> 00:53:00,467
There's no way around it.

582
00:53:02,304 --> 00:53:05,347
And that being the case,

583
00:53:05,515 --> 00:53:09,185
your brother's debt,

584
00:53:09,352 --> 00:53:11,103
his payment plan,

585
00:53:11,271 --> 00:53:13,022
remains the same.

586
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:15,191
l can't change that.

587
00:53:16,693 --> 00:53:18,319
So that being said...

588
00:53:21,239 --> 00:53:22,990
do you want me
to send someone else?

589
00:53:27,996 --> 00:53:29,705
Still with me on this, Tommy?

590
00:53:29,873 --> 00:53:31,790
Yeah, yeah, l guess.

591
00:53:33,001 --> 00:53:35,377
You guess or do you know?

592
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:39,924
- l ain't got no choice.
- Well, that's one way of putting it.

593
00:53:44,262 --> 00:53:46,388
Tread lightly, Tommy.
Take care of yourself.

594
00:53:47,974 --> 00:53:50,392
Thanks, Doug.

596
00:54:13,583 --> 00:54:15,376
Hello?

597
00:54:15,543 --> 00:54:17,294
Hey, babe.

598
00:54:17,462 --> 00:54:20,839
Hi, honey. Are you okay?
You sound tired.

599
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:23,968
Yeah, l am.
Long day.

600
00:54:24,135 --> 00:54:25,636
l'll tell you
about it tomorrow.

601
00:54:25,804 --> 00:54:27,513
Just wanted to call
and check in.

602
00:54:28,723 --> 00:54:31,225
That's about it really.

603
00:54:31,393 --> 00:54:33,560
My mind's just a little fried.

604
00:54:33,728 --> 00:54:36,939
l know the feeling.
Today's been crazy.

605
00:54:38,066 --> 00:54:41,110
- Any plans tonight?
- No, l'm gonna crash.

606
00:54:41,278 --> 00:54:44,655
Put in a pizza, glass of wine,
maybe watch a movie.

607
00:54:44,823 --> 00:54:46,448
- Take it easy.
- Sounds good.

608
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:50,619
Hey, when are we gonna spend
that day in bed together?

609
00:54:50,787 --> 00:54:54,206
We'd just get up to eat.

611
00:54:57,877 --> 00:54:59,586
Are you okay?

612
00:55:01,798 --> 00:55:03,841
Yeah, l'm good.
l just wanted to hear your voice.

613
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:10,264
l love you, Tommy.

614
00:55:13,184 --> 00:55:15,352
Be careful.
You hear me?

615
00:55:16,396 --> 00:55:18,105
Yeah.

616
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:34,788
Hey, l wonder if you might
help me get down the road?

617
00:55:34,956 --> 00:55:37,624
- Yeah, l'm heading north.
- Yeah, let me give you some money.

618
00:55:39,002 --> 00:55:41,795
We don't need your money.
Hop in. l'm going that way anyway.

619
00:55:41,963 --> 00:55:43,547
- You sure?
- Yeah.

620
00:55:56,895 --> 00:55:59,021
Tommy: This is good.
l'll walk from here.

621
00:56:06,154 --> 00:56:07,529
Hey, thanks for the ride.

622
00:56:07,697 --> 00:56:10,032
You get out
while the gettin's good.

623
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:12,201
l'm workin' on it,
l'm workin' on it.

624
00:56:25,507 --> 00:56:26,590
- l got him.
- Man: Are you sure it's him?

625
00:56:26,758 --> 00:56:29,134
Yeah, l'm sure.
He's not too goddamn hard to spot.

626
00:56:29,302 --> 00:56:31,011
Man:
He's heading to the German.

627
00:56:31,179 --> 00:56:32,971
Just keep him in sight.

628
00:56:33,139 --> 00:56:34,556
l'll be there in 20 minutes.

631
00:56:39,437 --> 00:56:41,605
Yeah, Devon, it's Carl.
We got him.

632
00:56:41,773 --> 00:56:43,857
lf you're lucky,
l'll leave you some crumbs.

633
00:56:44,025 --> 00:56:46,485
There's a reputation
to be made here.

634
00:57:05,505 --> 00:57:07,923
There you are,
you big bastard.

638
00:58:09,861 --> 00:58:12,613
l know you're
back there, Tommy!

639
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:16,617
l need that package
and you're going to give it to me.

640
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:30,005
l don't think so.

641
00:58:31,633 --> 00:58:34,009
One of us is gonna be
disappointed.

642
00:58:36,137 --> 00:58:37,971
An address.

643
00:58:38,139 --> 00:58:41,850
613 Low Arch Drive.

644
00:58:42,852 --> 00:58:44,269
Yes, Tommy.

645
00:58:44,437 --> 00:58:47,439
l know where you live,
where Darla lives.

646
00:58:47,607 --> 00:58:50,442
But don't worry,
that's not my style.

647
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:54,696
l just wanted you to know
that l could have if l wanted to.

648
00:58:56,199 --> 00:58:58,367
You see,
l work for Anthony.

649
00:58:58,535 --> 00:59:00,953
l fix things for him.

650
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:03,455
You run collections
for Big Doug.

651
00:59:03,623 --> 00:59:06,333
You got a reputation, man.
A good one.

652
00:59:08,878 --> 00:59:11,171
You know, why don't we just
skip all this and walk away?

653
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:19,054
Would you walk away, Tommy?

655
00:59:24,936 --> 00:59:26,478
No.

656
00:59:28,690 --> 00:59:30,440
Well, l hear you've been
a hardcase.

657
00:59:30,608 --> 00:59:32,901
Well, l specialize in
hardcases, Tommy.

658
00:59:34,571 --> 00:59:36,113
Whoa, yeah!

659
00:59:36,281 --> 00:59:38,574
Come on, just give me
the package, Tommy.

660
01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:06,310
l could do this all day, Tommy.

662
01:00:59,947 --> 01:01:03,408
No, man, please, no!

663
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:06,495
No!

665
01:01:17,215 --> 01:01:20,425
You better forget that address.

666
01:01:23,346 --> 01:01:25,222
Devon:
How you doing, Tommy?

667
01:01:25,390 --> 01:01:27,057
You just keep running,

668
01:01:27,225 --> 01:01:29,184
but you don't know well enough
to stay hidden, do you?

669
01:01:29,352 --> 01:01:31,895
You know, l took it easy
on you last time.

670
01:01:32,063 --> 01:01:34,189
l ain't gonna take it
easy on you this time.

672
01:01:45,993 --> 01:01:48,036
Are you sure he's out?

673
01:01:48,204 --> 01:01:50,205
For now.

674
01:02:28,536 --> 01:02:31,413
Devon: Yeah, yeah.
lt's the first door on the south side.

675
01:02:31,581 --> 01:02:32,998
We left it open for you.

676
01:02:35,501 --> 01:02:37,419
He's here.
We're in business.

677
01:02:43,926 --> 01:02:45,927
Here comes the man.

678
01:02:52,143 --> 01:02:54,394
What do you think
you're doing?

679
01:02:54,562 --> 01:02:57,355
Just a little payback
for Dosan and Jake.

680
01:02:57,523 --> 01:02:59,232
Anthony:
Sorry, love.

681
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:02,068
Trust me when l say
l understand

682
01:03:02,236 --> 01:03:04,112
the importance
of retribution,

683
01:03:05,281 --> 01:03:07,449
but l can't let that happen.

684
01:03:16,709 --> 01:03:19,419
The German's agreed to terms.

685
01:03:19,587 --> 01:03:21,713
Which means your crew
has earned its fee.

686
01:03:24,759 --> 01:03:27,010
But part of the deal is

687
01:03:27,178 --> 01:03:29,346
the German wants to see him.

688
01:03:33,309 --> 01:03:35,310
lt's business, Monique.

689
01:03:35,478 --> 01:03:37,646
That's all any of this is.

690
01:03:37,814 --> 01:03:40,440
lt's only ever been
about business.

691
01:03:50,076 --> 01:03:53,203
What is it that he wants
with you, big man?

692
01:03:54,205 --> 01:03:56,748
'Cause he sure reacted
strangely to your name.

693
01:03:58,835 --> 01:04:00,752
Huh?

694
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:04,714
l've got a feeling that whatever
the German has planned for you,

695
01:04:05,967 --> 01:04:07,342
it ain't gonna--

696
01:04:16,727 --> 01:04:18,186
Killed him with one hit.

697
01:04:18,354 --> 01:04:19,980
l've never seen
anything like it, Chief.

698
01:04:20,147 --> 01:04:21,982
Yeah, it sucks to be him.

699
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:26,194
Get him out of here.

700
01:04:26,362 --> 01:04:28,530
l'm gonna kill you next, sunshine.

701
01:04:32,785 --> 01:04:34,786
What are we gonna do now?

702
01:04:36,706 --> 01:04:39,207
We renegotiate the terms
of our deal with the German.

703
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:46,882
And until then?
What about him?

704
01:04:48,467 --> 01:04:51,052
Just make sure he's got a pulse
when you're done with him.

706
01:04:57,476 --> 01:04:59,269
Oh, you're good.

707
01:04:59,437 --> 01:05:01,521
l could use a man like you
on the team.

708
01:05:01,689 --> 01:05:03,982
l don't soldier for money.

709
01:05:04,150 --> 01:05:07,235
No? What axe did you
have to grind?

710
01:05:07,403 --> 01:05:10,530
l'm an American, son.
l fought for my country.

711
01:05:12,575 --> 01:05:14,910
Oh, they sure don't make 'em
like you anymore.

712
01:05:15,953 --> 01:05:19,372
No, Russian Spetsnaz are close,
but not quite.

713
01:05:19,540 --> 01:05:21,875
lt takes selection.

714
01:05:22,043 --> 01:05:24,044
What were you?
Force Recon? Ranger school?

715
01:05:24,211 --> 01:05:26,880
Chechnya, Mogadishu, Somalia?

716
01:05:27,048 --> 01:05:29,257
You see, names like that
don't mean much

717
01:05:29,425 --> 01:05:32,052
to normal people,
but to us, they do.

718
01:05:32,219 --> 01:05:34,471
Where did you learn
your trade?

719
01:05:34,639 --> 01:05:36,765
l took an online course.

721
01:05:39,435 --> 01:05:41,436
lt's good that you got
a sense of humor.

722
01:05:42,688 --> 01:05:44,981
This is Monique.

723
01:05:45,149 --> 01:05:48,485
She was Army Counterintelligence.
You know what that means.

724
01:05:49,654 --> 01:05:52,280
lt means she conducted
the interrogation

725
01:05:52,448 --> 01:05:55,241
of countless captured
al-Qaeda suspects.

726
01:05:55,409 --> 01:05:57,702
lt means

727
01:05:57,870 --> 01:06:01,039
she's a sadistic,
soulless bitch.

728
01:06:02,083 --> 01:06:04,292
She sounds like
one of my ex-wives.

729
01:06:05,461 --> 01:06:08,380
For five years,
work meant making men scream

730
01:06:08,547 --> 01:06:10,131
and beg for mercy,

731
01:06:10,299 --> 01:06:12,300
but it didn't affect her

732
01:06:12,468 --> 01:06:14,469
'cause she was good
at what she did.

733
01:06:14,637 --> 01:06:16,972
Very good.

734
01:06:47,962 --> 01:06:50,964
l'd clap, but l'm a little
tied up right now.

735
01:06:56,345 --> 01:06:57,721
She did what she did

736
01:06:57,888 --> 01:07:01,016
for minimum
warrant officer wage, Tommy.

737
01:07:01,183 --> 01:07:02,600
Just think what she's gonna do

738
01:07:02,768 --> 01:07:05,353
to the man who killed her fiancé.

739
01:07:08,858 --> 01:07:11,192
Just don't kill him.

740
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:12,986
We need some new wheels.

741
01:07:13,154 --> 01:07:15,822
l'm taking this.
l'll phone back in 20 minutes.

742
01:07:15,990 --> 01:07:17,991
Have fun.

743
01:07:27,877 --> 01:07:30,712
What Devon said
was not quite accurate.

744
01:07:33,758 --> 01:07:36,634
When it comes to
advanced interrogation techniques

745
01:07:36,802 --> 01:07:38,636
or "the alternative
set of procedures,"

746
01:07:38,804 --> 01:07:40,847
as the administration
referred to it--

747
01:07:41,015 --> 01:07:43,016
"torture,"
as you would call it,

748
01:07:46,896 --> 01:07:49,022
l never did it for money.

749
01:07:49,190 --> 01:07:51,274
l did it for fun.

751
01:08:05,331 --> 01:08:06,915
Let me see.

752
01:08:09,126 --> 01:08:11,753
Good.

753
01:08:25,601 --> 01:08:27,519
You don't care
about the package, do you?

754
01:08:29,396 --> 01:08:32,190
l'm the definition of
a consummate professional,

755
01:08:32,358 --> 01:08:34,359
but when you killed Dosan,

756
01:08:34,527 --> 01:08:36,653
you crossed an invisible line.

757
01:08:39,615 --> 01:08:41,241
Left or right?

758
01:08:41,408 --> 01:08:44,119
He screamed like a bitch,
you know.

759
01:08:45,412 --> 01:08:47,413
- What?
- Your fiancé.

760
01:08:51,836 --> 01:08:53,837
He died like a bitch.

761
01:08:58,634 --> 01:09:01,803
ls this your clumsy attempt
to incite a reaction?

762
01:09:03,722 --> 01:09:05,932
No, l'm just letting you know
he died like a bitch.

763
01:09:09,311 --> 01:09:11,312
Died screaming.

764
01:09:12,940 --> 01:09:15,316
Like a whiny, little--

765
01:09:15,484 --> 01:09:17,360
bitch.

766
01:09:20,072 --> 01:09:22,031
ls that all you got, lady?

768
01:09:38,966 --> 01:09:40,967
Hm.

769
01:09:50,644 --> 01:09:53,062
l know what
you're trying to do.

770
01:09:53,230 --> 01:09:55,523
You're trying to provoke me
into an emotional response.

771
01:09:55,691 --> 01:09:57,192
You think?

772
01:09:57,359 --> 01:10:00,653
l think you just about did it.

773
01:10:23,260 --> 01:10:25,261
Something's wrong.

775
01:10:55,876 --> 01:10:58,086
You are really starting
to piss me off.

776
01:11:50,889 --> 01:11:52,890
Shit!

778
01:13:04,546 --> 01:13:07,840
Well, well, Tommy, old son.

779
01:13:13,222 --> 01:13:15,640
Looks like you just increased
my take full share.

781
01:13:29,905 --> 01:13:31,864
Sir?

782
01:13:32,032 --> 01:13:34,700
The subject is conscious.

783
01:13:37,704 --> 01:13:38,913
Hello, Tommy.

784
01:13:44,962 --> 01:13:47,255
Hey, the German.

785
01:13:51,218 --> 01:13:53,636
But seriously, do you really
want me to call you that?

786
01:13:56,014 --> 01:13:58,683
l do.
What can l say?

787
01:13:59,893 --> 01:14:01,519
l like it.

788
01:14:03,063 --> 01:14:05,857
Besides, one never picks
one's own nickname.

789
01:14:06,024 --> 01:14:09,277
Which makes for tall men
named Shorty

790
01:14:09,445 --> 01:14:12,613
and fat men named Slim.

792
01:14:16,618 --> 01:14:18,244
So...

793
01:14:20,289 --> 01:14:22,123
what have you been up to
since we last met?

794
01:14:25,586 --> 01:14:27,920
You mean, since you
sold my ass down the river?

795
01:14:29,339 --> 01:14:31,382
Aw, but you had that coming.

796
01:14:32,384 --> 01:14:34,260
How do you figure?

797
01:14:37,306 --> 01:14:40,141
Well, you didn't follow through
with my request.

798
01:14:41,977 --> 01:14:45,438
But, l must admit,
l may have overreacted a bit.

799
01:14:47,649 --> 01:14:50,526
So do you know
why you're here, Thomas?

800
01:14:51,904 --> 01:14:53,571
No.

801
01:14:56,074 --> 01:14:59,035
l do have one
hellacious headache, though.

802
01:14:59,203 --> 01:15:01,078
Well, that's because we

803
01:15:01,246 --> 01:15:04,332
took a couple of pints
of your blood, Thomas.

804
01:15:07,419 --> 01:15:09,253
My blood?

805
01:15:09,421 --> 01:15:12,298
Well, l've taken all l can
from my father.

806
01:15:14,676 --> 01:15:17,637
That's-- that's pleasant.

807
01:15:22,184 --> 01:15:24,227
That is...

808
01:15:27,981 --> 01:15:29,982
reality.

809
01:15:32,027 --> 01:15:34,028
What was in the wallet?

810
01:15:36,865 --> 01:15:38,741
Season tickets.

811
01:15:38,909 --> 01:15:41,702
Good seats, too.
Hard to come by.

812
01:15:42,955 --> 01:15:45,790
But football tickets
do not a package make, Thomas,

813
01:15:45,958 --> 01:15:47,583
but you do.

814
01:15:47,751 --> 01:15:50,253
What's that got to do with me?

815
01:15:53,298 --> 01:15:55,883
You, Thomas.

816
01:15:57,052 --> 01:15:58,803
You are the package.

817
01:16:00,472 --> 01:16:02,056
You see,

818
01:16:02,224 --> 01:16:05,101
you and l, we--

819
01:16:05,269 --> 01:16:08,229
we share a common curse.

820
01:16:09,565 --> 01:16:12,567
An extremely rare
blood group.

821
01:16:15,404 --> 01:16:19,365
Most people have
A, B, AB, O,

822
01:16:19,533 --> 01:16:22,159
or one of
the assorted subsets.

823
01:16:22,327 --> 01:16:26,122
But the two of you
are designated HH.

824
01:16:26,290 --> 01:16:29,000
Sometimes known
as Bombay Blood.

825
01:16:30,752 --> 01:16:35,089
Sadly, the only compatible match
for an HH is another HH.

826
01:16:35,257 --> 01:16:37,925
And in the United States,

827
01:16:38,093 --> 01:16:41,762
.004% of the population
share this affliction.

828
01:16:41,930 --> 01:16:45,766
Big Doug had us all in
for physicals.

829
01:16:45,934 --> 01:16:48,728
Hemolytic anemia is--

830
01:16:48,895 --> 01:16:51,939
well, it's when the red blood cells
rupture and become dysfunctional.

831
01:16:52,107 --> 01:16:54,859
Extremely painful condition.

833
01:17:02,492 --> 01:17:06,203
Well, you see,

834
01:17:06,371 --> 01:17:09,290
l need clean blood, Thomas.

835
01:17:09,458 --> 01:17:11,876
But to find a compatible donor,

836
01:17:12,044 --> 01:17:13,628
it's highly unlikely.

837
01:17:13,795 --> 01:17:16,422
lt's almost impossible, in fact.

838
01:17:19,843 --> 01:17:24,305
lmagine my surprise
at finding one in my own stable.

839
01:17:27,809 --> 01:17:29,352
Doug know he was
sending me into this?

840
01:17:29,519 --> 01:17:31,771
Yeah, of course he did.

841
01:17:31,938 --> 01:17:33,814
Yeah.

842
01:17:33,982 --> 01:17:36,525
He sold you to me.

843
01:17:42,574 --> 01:17:44,659
l liked you, Thomas.

844
01:17:46,703 --> 01:17:48,704
You had potential.

845
01:17:52,668 --> 01:17:56,003
But when it comes to a man's
sheer willingness to survive,

846
01:17:57,798 --> 01:18:01,133
you'd be surprised
what one's willing to do.

847
01:18:23,448 --> 01:18:25,991
You're plumb unlucky,
you know that, right?

848
01:18:29,996 --> 01:18:30,996
Excuse me?

849
01:18:33,166 --> 01:18:35,167
We ain't compatible.

850
01:18:36,461 --> 01:18:38,546
You goddamn Kraut.

851
01:18:39,881 --> 01:18:41,716
What do you mean?

852
01:18:44,219 --> 01:18:46,220
Our blood may be the same,

853
01:18:46,388 --> 01:18:48,556
but there's the issue

854
01:18:48,724 --> 01:18:51,142
of my condition.

855
01:18:53,645 --> 01:18:55,521
He's a dead man.

856
01:18:56,898 --> 01:18:58,232
What condition?
Stop the drip.

857
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:00,276
What-- what condition?

858
01:19:02,696 --> 01:19:04,822
l-- l can't.

859
01:19:04,990 --> 01:19:07,867
What? Tell me, Thomas.
What-- what are you saying?

860
01:19:08,034 --> 01:19:10,703
- l can't.
- Tell me what you mean.

862
01:19:23,675 --> 01:19:25,384
Guards! Guards!

863
01:19:25,552 --> 01:19:27,553
Guards!

864
01:19:33,435 --> 01:19:35,269
No! Don't shoot!

865
01:19:35,437 --> 01:19:37,938
Don't kill him! Don't!

867
01:21:01,648 --> 01:21:03,774
God damn, Tommy.

868
01:21:03,942 --> 01:21:06,402
You just don't know
when to quit, do you?

869
01:21:11,324 --> 01:21:12,867
Had yourself
one hell of a day, huh?

870
01:21:13,034 --> 01:21:15,327
lt ain't over yet.

871
01:21:15,495 --> 01:21:18,122
There's a lot of money out there.

872
01:21:18,290 --> 01:21:21,000
The kind of money a man
could have a lifetime on.

873
01:21:21,167 --> 01:21:24,920
The kind of money a man
could get lost with.

874
01:21:26,631 --> 01:21:28,507
l'm not greedy.

875
01:21:28,675 --> 01:21:31,760
l could just as easily
split it 50/50.

876
01:21:31,928 --> 01:21:35,514
l'll even give you the Merc.
l'll walk.

877
01:21:38,059 --> 01:21:40,603
Tommy, think about it.

879
01:21:44,941 --> 01:21:46,901
Think about it.

880
01:21:47,068 --> 01:21:48,569
You don't need to kill me.

881
01:21:48,737 --> 01:21:51,447
l'm just a man doing his job.

882
01:21:51,615 --> 01:21:54,408
On the job or no job,

883
01:21:54,576 --> 01:21:57,828
you killed my partner.

884
01:22:00,498 --> 01:22:03,709
Yeah, now,

885
01:22:03,877 --> 01:22:05,878
l'm gonna kill you.

886
01:22:06,046 --> 01:22:08,047
Drop the guns, Tommy.

888
01:22:29,444 --> 01:22:32,279
Your blood's no good to me
if you're dead.

889
01:22:34,491 --> 01:22:36,492
Turn around.

890
01:22:40,664 --> 01:22:43,082
Well, you have what l need,
Thomas.

891
01:22:43,249 --> 01:22:46,710
And l'm gonna take it
with or without your consent.

892
01:23:05,897 --> 01:23:08,315
l heard you killed Anthony
with one strike.

893
01:23:08,483 --> 01:23:10,985
l've only seen a man
kill like that once.

894
01:23:13,530 --> 01:23:16,031
l was holding
a roll of quarters at the time.

896
01:23:36,678 --> 01:23:39,179
l don't suppose it would
make a difference

897
01:23:39,347 --> 01:23:41,473
if l said we could just
walk away from this, does it?

899
01:23:43,101 --> 01:23:45,561
Not this time, Tommy.

900
01:23:45,729 --> 01:23:48,063
The stakes are too high.

901
01:24:32,901 --> 01:24:34,985
Ain't no rules
in this game, Tommy.

902
01:24:46,081 --> 01:24:48,123
You got that right, jackass.

905
01:25:15,068 --> 01:25:17,069
Still here.

906
01:25:37,632 --> 01:25:39,633
No need for that.

907
01:25:45,431 --> 01:25:48,100
Let's go.

908
01:25:48,268 --> 01:25:50,227
lt's good to see you, Tommy.

909
01:25:51,896 --> 01:25:53,564
You mean that?

910
01:25:54,816 --> 01:25:56,525
Yes, yes l do.

911
01:25:59,445 --> 01:26:01,738
l know you do.

912
01:26:02,824 --> 01:26:05,576
lt was business,
Tommy, just business.

913
01:26:08,037 --> 01:26:11,081
Just one man following
a bigger man's orders.

914
01:26:13,251 --> 01:26:17,004
Tommy, if l tried to keep you
hidden from the German,

915
01:26:17,172 --> 01:26:19,673
he would have taken
everything from me.

916
01:26:19,841 --> 01:26:23,677
- Everything.
- l figured as much.

917
01:26:25,138 --> 01:26:28,182
- Did he pay you up front?
- He did.

918
01:26:29,517 --> 01:26:32,227
And that clears
your brother's debt.

919
01:26:39,694 --> 01:26:42,112
With him dead,
what does that make you?

921
01:26:46,868 --> 01:26:48,952
An older man

922
01:26:49,120 --> 01:26:50,954
having grown tired
of this game.

923
01:26:51,122 --> 01:26:53,290
l hear ya.

924
01:26:57,045 --> 01:26:58,712
What now?

925
01:27:01,341 --> 01:27:03,884
Well, the way l see it,

926
01:27:04,052 --> 01:27:06,553
we either proceed as before

927
01:27:06,721 --> 01:27:09,765
and file this little incident away,

928
01:27:11,893 --> 01:27:13,894
or we go our separate ways,

929
01:27:14,062 --> 01:27:16,146
leave the baggage behind

930
01:27:16,314 --> 01:27:20,859
and wish each other
a hearty Godspeed.

931
01:27:25,281 --> 01:27:27,449
A hearty Godspeed.

932
01:27:39,212 --> 01:27:41,421
Godspeed, Big D.

933
01:27:47,262 --> 01:27:49,263
Godspeed, Tommy.

934
01:27:51,099 --> 01:27:52,641
Godspeed.

935
01:28:20,586 --> 01:28:22,587
Thank you, Tommy.

936
01:28:23,798 --> 01:28:25,799
Thank you.

937
01:28:27,468 --> 01:28:29,386
Hey, man, you'd have done
the same thing for me.

939
01:28:36,311 --> 01:28:38,437
Look, l'm gonna
get out of here soon.

940
01:28:39,856 --> 01:28:42,149
And this time,
l ain't ever coming back.

941
01:28:44,193 --> 01:28:46,486
l'm gonna set
things right, Tommy.

942
01:28:47,780 --> 01:28:49,781
l'm gonna do that for you.

943
01:28:52,493 --> 01:28:54,494
l know you will, bro.

944
01:28:55,997 --> 01:28:57,998
l know you will.

945
01:29:24,817 --> 01:29:27,944
Man: Mercedes for the pickup
straight across? Deal.

946
01:29:30,073 --> 01:29:31,823
Here are the keys.

947
01:29:31,991 --> 01:29:34,201
Pink slip's
in the glove compartment.

948
01:29:37,538 --> 01:29:39,373
Well, it was a pleasure
doing business with you, Tommy.

949
01:29:39,540 --> 01:29:41,583
Thanks, Gary.
l'll be seeing you around, brother.

953
01:29:49,467 --> 01:29:51,468
Hey, l'm back.

954
01:29:52,470 --> 01:29:53,887
Yeah, one piece mainly.

955
01:29:54,055 --> 01:29:55,972
- Hey, Tommy.
- Hang on.

956
01:29:56,140 --> 01:29:58,141
You forgot this.

957
01:29:59,143 --> 01:30:00,894
Sorry, Gary,
been a long day.

958
01:30:01,062 --> 01:30:03,021
They all are, huh?

959
01:30:04,065 --> 01:30:06,400
Hey, yeah, we can talk
about it over dinner.

960
01:30:11,739 --> 01:30:13,740
Hang on.

961
01:30:30,675 --> 01:30:33,593
Hey, remember when you asked me
what l'd do if a miracle happened?

962
01:30:35,179 --> 01:30:38,098
l got a surprise for you.

963
01:30:38,266 --> 01:30:41,435
Hey, l love you.
