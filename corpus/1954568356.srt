Sub by: JoeShmoe.

2
00:02:40,733 --> 00:02:42,500
What are you doing out here?

3
00:02:43,633 --> 00:02:46,617
- I'm lost.
- This is a restricted area.

4
00:02:46,701 --> 00:02:49,116
Oh, I didn't know that. There's no signs.

5
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,700
They're everywhere.

6
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,832
Let's see some ID.

7
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,432
Why?

8
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,265
If you broke the gate back there
your trespassing.

9
00:02:57,466 --> 00:02:58,600
Excuse me sir.

10
00:02:58,826 --> 00:03:01,682
That gate was open and I was under
the opinion this is a detour.

11
00:03:01,766 --> 00:03:03,816
Let me see your ID. Take it out.

12
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,616
What kind of uniform is that?

13
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,900
I'll ask the fucking questions!

14
00:03:08,005 --> 00:03:10,065
It's a private outfit, huh.

15
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:13,816
I tried to get one of those jobs. I
like guarding things.

16
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,000
Really.

17
00:03:16,306 --> 00:03:17,116
Here you go, sir.

18
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,600
I think what must have happened is I
got turned around there.

19
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:01,049
I guesstimate that I have about 50 lbs of
copper wire...

20
00:04:01,133 --> 00:04:02,719
100 lbs of chain link fence...

21
00:04:02,803 --> 00:04:05,002
and 2 manhole covers, the nice thick ones.

22
00:04:05,233 --> 00:04:09,049
I'll give you 50 cents a pound for the wire,
15 for the fence and 10 for the covers.

23
00:04:09,133 --> 00:04:10,949
That's below market value.

24
00:04:11,033 --> 00:04:12,116
Market value?

25
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,962
You've got a cop that came by asking
about manhole covers?

26
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,499
I'd like to counter...

27
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,950
$1.00 per pound for the copper,
$0.30 for the fence...

28
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,016
and 20 cents for the covers.

29
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,500
Sell them somewhere else.

30
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,800
I'd feel good at 75, 25 and 15.

31
00:04:25,903 --> 00:04:27,016
I'm not negotiating with you.

32
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,105
- I think we're close.
- I'm done!

33
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,622
I'm willing to take less to establish
a business relationship.

34
00:04:38,706 --> 00:04:40,905
If that's your last best offer, then
I guess I accept.

35
00:04:41,006 --> 00:04:43,200
Alright, drive around back and
unload them.

36
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,000
Excuse me, sir.

37
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,100
I'm looking for a job.

38
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,316
In fact, I made up my mind to find
a career...

39
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,116
that I can learn and grow into.

40
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,700
Who am I? I'm a hard worker.

41
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,609
I set high goals and I'm told that
I'm persistent.

42
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,316
Now I'm not fooling myself, sir.

43
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,026
Having been raised with the self esteem
movement so popular in schools...

44
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:04,916
I used to expect my needs to be considered.

45
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,717
But I know that today's work culture
no longer caters to the job loyalty...

46
00:05:07,801 --> 00:05:09,966
that could be promised to earlier generations.

47
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:11,317
What I believe sir...

48
00:05:11,401 --> 00:05:13,816
is that good things come to those
who work their assess off.

49
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,816
And that people such as yourself who
reached the top of the mountain...

50
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,290
didn't just fall there.

51
00:05:17,501 --> 00:05:19,416
My motto is: If you want to win
the lottery...

52
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,100
you have to make the money to buy a ticket.

53
00:05:22,499 --> 00:05:24,299
Did I say that I worked in a garage?

54
00:05:26,703 --> 00:05:28,865
So what do you say? I could start
tomorrow or...

55
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,400
even why not tonight.

56
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:31,900
No!

57
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:42,717
How about an internship then?

58
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:45,156
A lot of young people are taking unpaid
positions to get a foot in the door.

59
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,700
That's something I'd be willing to do.

60
00:05:47,296 --> 00:05:49,365
I'm not hiring a fucking thief.

61
00:07:01,566 --> 00:07:02,706
[Joe Loder] Let's go.

62
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,000
- We're first.
- No shit.

63
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,165
- Get a shot on the other side.
- Alright, alright.

64
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,665
Get a shot inside the car.

65
00:07:17,706 --> 00:07:20,800
Go around get inside the car. What the
fuck am I paying you for!

66
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:29,617
Get back, Loder.

67
00:07:29,701 --> 00:07:31,800
- Get back!
- I'm back, I'm back.

68
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,700
Excuse me.

69
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,200
Will this be on television?

70
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,686
Morning news. If it bleeds, it leads.

71
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:03,800
What channel?

72
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,865
Whoever pays the most.

73
00:08:06,866 --> 00:08:08,565
What do you get for something like this?

74
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:11,899
Not nearly enough.

75
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,250
But enough to buy all that gear.

76
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:19,700
Let me tell you something.

77
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:22,150
It's a flaming asshole of a job.

78
00:08:23,299 --> 00:08:26,100
Can I ask you are you currently hiring?

79
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,600
Fuck no.

80
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:30,600
Well...

81
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,347
Thank you for taking the time to
discuss what you do.

82
00:08:33,431 --> 00:08:34,317

injured, but managed to escape with her life...

107
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,899
thanks to the bravery of a couple of
CHP officers.

108
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:44,799
The crash started a fire that then
quickly consumed the entire vehicle.

109
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,819
As we see in this dramatic video...

110
00:10:46,903 --> 00:10:51,599
CHP Officers Mike Tully and John Wall
risked their lives to save the single mom...

111
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,317
Flores was then transferred to
Saint Joseph's Hospital...

112

This is a custom racing bicycle sir...

116
00:11:43,601 --> 00:11:45,366
designed for competitive road cycling.

117
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:49,416
This bike has a lightweight space-age
carbon frame and handlebars...

118
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,700
positioned to put the rider in a more
aerodynamic posture.

119
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,216
It also has micro-shifters and 37 gears
and weighs under 6 pounds.

120
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,000
I won the Tour De Mexico on this bike.

121
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,500
700 is as high as I'll go.

122
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,600
It cost me over 8,000 new.

123
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:05,117
- 700.
- 2500 and that's giving it away.

124

00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,199
Get the fuck home. There's people trying to
do their fucking job.

173
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:13,600
Fucking asshole!

174
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:20,330
Yes, it's Ace Video. Your leads
gonna be at 1st and Western.

175
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,700
Tell you when I get there.

176
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,000
It's a shooting.

177
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:25,665
Yeah I got some great footage of a
victim being treated.

178
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,567
No the LAPD hasn't released it but the
manager of the Walgreen’s...

179
00:15:28,651 --> 00:15:30,801
said that it was a carjacking
and the victim was the owner.

180
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:32,465
He's Asian and critical.

181
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:33,465
Right.

182
00:15:33,966 --> 00:15:36,660
Look I got a 60 second cut with the
manager and a neighborhood.

183
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:39,400
$500.

184
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,300
Well then make me a deal, $400.

185
00:15:41,932 --> 00:15:44,000
$300. Alright, deal.

186
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:48,106
Are you fucking kidding me?!

187
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:49,800
Get outta here.

188
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,102
Let's open with the shooting in Downey.

189
00:16:33,809 --> 00:16:36,717
- She wants a stand in with the story.
- Okay, do what you have to.

190
00:16:36,801 --> 00:16:40,300
- I don't think that's gonna cover it.
- Hey it's not my call.

191
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,600
Oh, excuse me.

192
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:49,170
- Excuse me, I have video footage.
- Down the hall to the right.

193
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,316
Put the neighbor here and the kids with
their mother by the door.

194
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,417
- And date it back from 2:16.
- Okay.

195
00:17:00,501 --> 00:17:03,817
Then I want to run in some sound. Let's
leave the neighbors dog barking.

196
00:17:03,901 --> 00:17:07,567
And try taking the crying kid from B roll
and drop that in the background.

197
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:08,600
Okay.

198
00:17:09,003 --> 00:17:11,565
- Are you my film operator.
- I don't think so.

199
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:14,165
I'm Lou Bloom. I have some
footage for sale.

200
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,300
A stringer?

201
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,399
- What?
- Who do you work for?

202
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,500
At the moment, I work for myself.

203
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:25,275
See Frank out there the
way you came.

204
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,700
- What's it timed to?
- 01:06

205
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,220
What do you have?

206
00:17:33,433 --> 00:17:35,716
Something I'm fairly certain you'll
be excited about.

207
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:36,890
What is it?

208
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,800
It's a shooting.

209
00:17:38,965 --> 00:17:40,810
A man was shot, several times in fact...

210
00:17:40,895 --> 00:17:43,243
he was laying on the ground, he was
bleeding on the ground.

211
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,366
I'd be surprised if he survived, honestly.

212
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:47,002
He was shot during a carjacking.

213
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,982
Western and 1st?

214
00:17:49,066 --> 00:17:51,899
- Yes, that's right.
- Okay well we're getting that from this.

215
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,700
I was there. I was much closer to
what happened.

216
00:17:56,216 --> 00:17:58,399
Okay, okay. Let's see it.

217
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,895
Fast forward through this.

218
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,916
Keep going, keep going.

219
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,400
<i>Walk away or I'll arrest you for a ...</i>

220
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,765
- Get out of here!
- A minute and a half in.

221
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,700
Ah, there.

222
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,100
- I got no pulse.
- Oh fuck!

223
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:24,632
I need you to see something.

224
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:33,566
Yeah.

225
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:36,505
Lou Bloom, Frank Kruse our assignment editor.

226
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:37,850
Play it back.

227
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,399
<i>- I got no pulse.
- He's unresponsive.</i>

228
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,502
And that's the lead.

229
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:48,065
I want to break it up and do a wrap
around from the scene.

230
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:50,816
I want a walking stand up, a teaser
at 5, a repeat on the half...

231
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,742
and I want the copy to start with a warning.

232
00:18:52,827 --> 00:18:53,716
You're gonna show this?!

233
00:18:53,801 --> 00:18:55,516
- With a warning.
- It's excessive.

234
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,516
We should have packages like this every day.

235
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,617
People are eating breakfast.

236
00:18:58,701 --> 00:19:00,616
And they'll talk about it at work.

237
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:03,017
Tie it in with the carjacking last
month in Glendale...

238
00:19:03,101 --> 00:19:06,217
and the other one, the van, in Palms.
When was that, in March?

239
00:19:06,301 --> 00:19:09,017
- Yeah March.
- It's a carjacking crime wave.

240
00:19:09,101 --> 00:19:10,500
That's the banner.

241
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:13,616
Call the victims family, go to court,
you know what to do.

242
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:14,800
Yeah.

243
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,300
How much?

244
00:19:17,665 --> 00:19:19,317
I'm selling this particular piece
for $1,000.

245
00:19:19,401 --> 00:19:22,337
Not even close. This late you have
nowhere else to go.

246
00:19:22,421 --> 00:19:24,009
And the quality is for shit.

247
00:19:24,265 --> 00:19:26,400
I'll give you 250 that's the
most I'll give.

248
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,800
Now let's get you paid.

249
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,200
Here you go.

250
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,016
Buy yourself some better equipment.

251
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:35,610
A directional mic and get
interviews when you can.

252
00:19:35,801 --> 00:19:37,500
- You have a good eye.
- Thank you.

253
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,617
I'm just beginning, so praise from someone
such as yourself...

254
00:19:40,701 --> 00:19:42,616
as you can imagine that means quite a lot.

255
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,416
Well I'll help in any way I can.

256
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,000
And of course you can help me by
calling us first.

257
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,146
I want you to contact me when you
have something.

258
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:50,700
- Something like this.
- That's right.

259
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:51,909
Bloody.

260
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,716
Well that's only part of it. We like
crime, but not all crime.

261
00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:00,117
Carjacking in Compton, for example.
That isn't news now is it.

262
00:20:00,201 --> 00:20:00,518
Nina.

263
00:20:00,602 --> 00:20:03,502
We find our viewers are more interested
in urban crime...

264
00:20:03,838 --> 00:20:05,660
creeping into the suburbs.

265
00:20:05,978 --> 00:20:07,730
What that means is a victim...

266
00:20:07,817 --> 00:20:10,771
or victims, preferably well off, white.

267
00:20:11,048 --> 00:20:13,624
Injured at the hands of the poor, or
a minority.

268
00:20:14,084 --> 00:20:15,002
Just crimes?

269
00:20:15,387 --> 00:20:19,203
No, accidents play. Cars, buses,
trains, planes, fire...

270
00:20:19,287 --> 00:20:20,982
But bloody.

271
00:20:21,891 --> 00:20:23,690
Well, graphic.

272
00:20:23,984 --> 00:20:26,498
The best and clearest way that I can
phrase it to you Lou...

273
00:20:26,865 --> 00:20:29,065
that captures the spirit of what we are...

274
00:20:29,319 --> 00:20:31,716
is think of our news cast as a
screaming woman...

275
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:34,117
running down the street with her throat cut.

276
00:20:34,998 --> 00:20:36,314
I understand.

277
00:20:37,336 --> 00:20:40,727
I'm a very, very quick learner. You'll
be seeing me again.

278
00:20:41,383 --> 00:20:42,614
I believe you.

279
00:20:49,794 --> 00:20:53,345
Live from the KWLA broadcast
center in Los Angeles.

280
00:20:53,628 --> 00:20:56,406
This is KWLA 6 News at 6am.

281
00:20:56,747 --> 00:20:58,378
Coverage you can count on.

282
00:21:00,438 --> 00:21:03,157
A tragic drug store visit to help
his ailing wife...

283
00:21:03,241 --> 00:21:06,693
claimed the life of a loving husband last
night near Hancock Park.

284
00:21:06,895 --> 00:21:09,330
Reporting from the scene is Ron De La Cruz.

285
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:12,741
An act of kindness turned into
a savage, deadly attack...

286
00:21:12,825 --> 00:21:16,439
just outside this market on Western and 1st
around 2am.

287
00:21:16,523 --> 00:21:20,589
Where 68 year old Richard Cho of Mar Vista
was walking towards his car...

288
00:21:20,673 --> 00:21:22,770
with a prescription for his sick wife...

289
00:21:22,888 --> 00:21:26,537
when he was confronted right here by a man
with a 9mm handgun...

290
00:21:26,752 --> 00:21:29,235
who police believe wanted to take
his vehicle.

291
00:21:29,446 --> 00:21:32,641
The vicious tragedy and senselessness
of the brutal shooting...

292
00:21:32,889 --> 00:21:36,703
as well as the victims final moments,
were all caught in graphic video...

293
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:38,437
which we are about to show.

294
00:21:38,639 --> 00:21:40,755
Viewer discretion is advised.

295
00:21:41,061 --> 00:21:44,770
Paramedics worked feverishly to
save the life of Richard Cho...

296
00:21:44,894 --> 00:21:48,113
but despite heroic efforts, the husband
and father of three...

297
00:21:48,305 --> 00:21:50,692
was pronounced dead at Good Samaritan Hospital.

298
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:53,578
Alarmingly, this is the third
violent carjacking...

299
00:21:53,662 --> 00:21:55,712
in the area in recent months.

300
00:21:55,852 --> 00:21:57,962
And residents here are growing concerned...

301
00:21:58,127 --> 00:22:00,541
as police are still without any leads.

302
00:22:00,707 --> 00:22:03,201
This is Ron De La Cruz, reporting live.

303
00:22:15,265 --> 00:22:18,826
CARJACKING CRIME WAVE

304
00:22:20,208 --> 00:22:22,015
<i>[Scanner] Hollywood clear.</i>

305
00:22:23,697 --> 00:22:28,146

306

307

312
00:23:36,402 --> 00:23:38,167
- Sorry I'm late.
- Are you Richard?

313
00:23:38,469 --> 00:23:39,489
Rick.

314
00:23:39,902 --> 00:23:41,710
- I'm Louis Bloom.
- Oh, hey Lou.

315
00:23:41,885 --> 00:23:42,644
Louis.

316
00:23:43,294 --> 00:23:44,339
Sit down.

317
00:23:48,933 --> 00:23:52,529
The situation is that I lost an employee
and I'm interviewing for a replacement.

318
00:23:53,115 --> 00:23:56,143
The ad didn't say what the job was?

319
00:23:56,963 --> 00:23:59,334
It's a fine opportunity for some
lucky someone.

320
00:24:00,451 --> 00:24:01,491
Okay.

321
00:24:02,516 --> 00:24:05,450
I'd like to know about your prior employment
and hear it in your own words...

322
00:24:05,723 --> 00:24:07,863
what you learned from this position

323
00:24:08,674 --> 00:24:09,978
My old jobs?

324
00:24:11,504 --> 00:24:13,830
I did landscaping for a couple months...

325
00:24:14,702 --> 00:24:17,096
Mold blue and gold??

326
00:24:19,727 --> 00:24:22,726
I learned that I had hay fever, so I quit.

327
00:24:24,264 --> 00:24:25,528
Other jobs?

328
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:28,919
Like a week here a week there.

329
00:24:30,531 --> 00:24:32,139
Why hire you?

330
00:24:33,775 --> 00:24:35,088
Sell yourself.

331
00:24:35,429 --> 00:24:36,780
- Ok.
- Go.

332
00:24:38,914 --> 00:24:40,538
I'm Rick, of course..

333
00:24:44,009 --> 00:24:48,829
I took three buses to get here, I
finished high school, I need a job...

334
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,178
I'd do pretty much anything if
you hire me.

335
00:24:54,262 --> 00:24:55,917
What's your address, Richard?

336
00:24:56,707 --> 00:24:59,285
I don't have one right now.

337
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:02,190
- You're homeless.
- I was for a while.

338
00:25:02,861 --> 00:25:03,747
You trick.

339
00:25:04,157 --> 00:25:06,396
- What the street, no.
- Wasn't a question.

340
00:25:07,171 --> 00:25:09,299
- I'm straight.
- How many straight guys trick?

341
00:25:09,501 --> 00:25:11,769
- Do you have a drivers license?
- Yeah.

342
00:25:12,914 --> 00:25:14,118
You know Los Angeles?

343
00:25:14,438 --> 00:25:16,807
- Yeah I grew up all around here.
- Can you start tonight?

344
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:18,878
Doing what?

345
00:25:22,258 --> 00:25:25,470
I run a successful TV news business.

346
00:25:26,017 --> 00:25:27,752
We film breaking stories.

347
00:25:28,336 --> 00:25:30,973
Maybe you saw my item this morning,
the fatal carjacking.

348
00:25:31,617 --> 00:25:34,522
No, I don't have a TV, but that's cool.

349
00:25:35,205 --> 00:25:37,421
- Do you have a cell phone?
- Yeah.

350
00:25:38,934 --> 00:25:40,801
- Does it have GPS?
- Yes, it does.

351
00:25:40,918 --> 00:25:42,529
Congratulations, you're hired.

352
00:25:43,101 --> 00:25:44,000
Okay.

353
00:25:45,932 --> 00:25:49,675
Your job will be to listen to emergency
radio, learn police codes...

354
00:25:49,942 --> 00:25:52,482
help navigate and watch the car.

355
00:25:53,444 --> 00:25:54,243
Okay.

356
00:25:54,935 --> 00:25:57,419
- And what does it pay?
- It's an internship.

357
00:26:00,305 --> 00:26:02,292
Man, I uh...

358
00:26:03,058 --> 00:26:05,718
I can't do that, I need money.

359
00:26:06,096 --> 00:26:08,516
I'm giving you a chance to explore
career options...

360
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,254
and gain insight into my organization.

361
00:26:10,338 --> 00:26:13,581
It's not at all unusual for me to make
full time job offers to my interns.

362
00:26:14,207 --> 00:26:15,833
I just...

363
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:21,975
I gotta get paid, I need something
at least, you know?

364
00:26:26,863 --> 00:26:29,029
I'll give you $30 cash per night.

365
00:26:30,019 --> 00:26:30,883
OK.

366
00:26:31,306 --> 00:26:32,574
Okay.

367
00:26:33,481 --> 00:26:34,799
Yes.

371

375
00:27:00,907 --> 00:27:02,023
And code 3 is?

376
00:27:02,488 --> 00:27:04,988
With lights and sirens.

377
00:27:05,676 --> 00:27:06,837

and then a right.

00:28:46,476 --> 00:28:47,525
On what?!

402
00:28:48,484 --> 00:28:51,382
I made a mistake, it was a right
five blocks back.

403
00:28:54,078 --> 00:28:55,685
It's just 5 blocks.

404
00:29:09,674 --> 00:29:12,020
- Did they bring them out?
- They just left 2 minutes ago.

405
00:29:12,104 --> 00:29:15,269
You're a lifetime too late. Nice camera.

406
00:29:34,262 --> 00:29:36,716
I bet I wasted $5 in gas just getting here...

407
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,600
or don't you think that's a lot of money?!

408
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:42,743
I'm sorry. I couldn't see the street you
were driving so fast.

409
00:29:44,103 --> 00:29:45,543
First of all, Richard...

410
00:29:46,021 --> 00:29:48,350
Don't answer me by telling me a problem.

411
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:53,623
I have enough of those already. Bring me a
solution and then we can make a decision together.

412
00:29:54,121 --> 00:29:56,913
Okay, maybe if you didn't rush me.

413
00:29:59,286 --> 00:30:01,579
Don't rush you. Okay, I can use that.

414
00:30:02,834 --> 00:30:05,040
You see Rick, they've done studies...

415
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:08,181
and they found that any system that
relies on cooperation...

416
00:30:08,412 --> 00:30:11,982
from a school of fish or a professional
hockey team...

417
00:30:12,066 --> 00:30:14,437
these experts have identified communication...

418
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:17,744
as the number 1 single key to success.

419
00:30:25,075 --> 00:30:27,006
Do you know what F.E.A.R stands for?

420
00:30:27,983 --> 00:30:28,790
What?

421

422
00:30:34,155 --> 00:30:36,298
You're going really fucking fast, man.

423
00:30:36,382 --> 00:30:38,737
Get out of your head Rick, it's
a bad neighborhood.

424
00:30:39,404 --> 00:30:41,500
And when you get a chance, I'd like to
know where we're going.

425
00:30:42,162 --> 00:30:44,797
Left on 3rd in six blocks.

426
00:30:50,494 --> 00:30:53,697
Find a more appropriate place to park the
car and don't get blocked in.

427
00:31:02,441 --> 00:31:03,975
Sir, what's going on?

428
00:31:04,393 --> 00:31:05,689
Who the fuck are you?

429
00:31:11,017 --> 00:31:12,874
TV news, what happened?

430
00:31:13,212 --> 00:31:14,309
It was a shooting.

431
00:31:14,843 --> 00:31:16,922
I told the cops that he was waving
a gun last week...

432
00:31:17,006 --> 00:31:18,704
but they didn't fucking care.

433
00:31:19,694 --> 00:31:21,523
Can you try one more time without swearing.

434
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:25,088
- I'm not doing it again.
- But this is for TV.

435
00:31:25,352 --> 00:31:27,270
Yeah? I don't have a TV.

436
00:31:37,197 --> 00:31:38,107
It's over.

437
00:31:39,082 --> 00:31:40,821
Shot to shit.

438
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:03,389
<i>[Nina] Great shot.</i>

439
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:07,788
Oh that's fantastic.

440
00:33:08,753 --> 00:33:10,865
Oh that's a great piece of tape.

441
00:33:11,945 --> 00:33:14,714
- You couldn't get an interview with the couple?
- I have footage of them.

442
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:17,644
I had an interview with the neighbor,
but she curses.

443
00:33:17,729 --> 00:33:18,638
We can cut that out.

444
00:33:18,723 --> 00:33:20,215
How did you get inside the house?

445
00:33:20,482 --> 00:33:22,170
- The door was open.
- They allowed you?!

446
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:24,852
I heard somebody yell to come in and
nobody was inside, I left.

447
00:33:24,936 --> 00:33:26,949
The only shot of the couple is
through a window?

448
00:33:27,138 --> 00:33:28,620
The police were shutting it down.

449
00:33:28,924 --> 00:33:30,051
- I don't like it.
- Like what?

450
00:33:30,136 --> 00:33:31,820
The footage looks like he broke in.

451
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:33,698
There's no closeup of the homeowners...

452
00:33:33,783 --> 00:33:36,062
and he's giving us their name off a piece
of private correspondence.

453
00:33:36,147 --> 00:33:38,819
- Excuse me, that's junk mail.
- Well I have a problem with that.

454
00:33:38,903 --> 00:33:40,942
- We'll knock out a killer package.
- This is my job.

455
00:33:41,026 --> 00:33:41,905
No!

456
00:33:42,112 --> 00:33:43,916
Your job is writing the tweet of the day.

457
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,900
And getting Deb to turn sideways during
the weather forecast.

458
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,356
We're running it!

459
00:33:48,941 --> 00:33:53,007
I like how you handled Frank. You didn't
soften the truth or dilute it.

460
00:33:53,212 --> 00:33:55,394
I think being clear with your objectives is more
important than...

461
00:33:55,479 --> 00:33:58,644
trying to present your ideas in a
non-confrontational manner.

462
00:33:58,966 --> 00:34:00,999
Do you have experience in an office?

463
00:34:01,209 --> 00:34:02,846
Nice ?? I'll have you know.

464
00:34:03,353 --> 00:34:06,086
- Where did you get all that?
- I study a lot online.

465
00:34:06,218 --> 00:34:08,798
- Oh, yeah? Like what?
- All sorts of things, actually.

466
00:34:08,976 --> 00:34:10,681
I'm on my computer all day.

467
00:34:11,999 --> 00:34:13,824
I haven't had what you'd call much of
a formal education...

468
00:34:13,908 --> 00:34:16,600
but can find almost anything if
you look hard enough.

469
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:25,328
Last year...

470
00:34:25,939 --> 00:34:28,144
I took an online business course
for example.

471
00:34:28,290 --> 00:34:29,401
And I learned...

472
00:34:29,793 --> 00:34:32,848
that you have to have a business plan
before starting a business.

473
00:34:33,277 --> 00:34:35,285
And why you pursue something...

474
00:34:35,473 --> 00:34:37,906
is equally as important as what you pursue.

475
00:34:39,397 --> 00:34:41,239
The site advised you to...

476
00:34:42,156 --> 00:34:45,900
answer the following question before you
decide where to focus your abilities.

477
00:34:45,985 --> 00:34:47,447
The question was...

478
00:34:47,578 --> 00:34:49,148
"What do I like to do?"

479
00:34:50,707 --> 00:34:53,542
The site suggested making a list
of your strengths and weaknesses.

480
00:34:53,807 --> 00:34:56,360
"What am I good at? What am I not good at?"

481
00:34:57,187 --> 00:35:00,354
Maybe I want to strengthen and develop
knowledge about the things I'm good at...

482
00:35:00,438 --> 00:35:02,884
maybe I want to strengthen my weaknesses.

483
00:35:08,695 --> 00:35:10,824
I recently remade my list.

484
00:35:12,439 --> 00:35:13,806
And I'm thinking...

485
00:35:14,988 --> 00:35:16,541
that television news...

486
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:19,334
might just be something I love...

487
00:35:20,446 --> 00:35:22,963
as well as something I happen to be good at.

488
00:35:36,185 --> 00:35:38,139
On TV it looks so real.

489
00:35:39,678 --> 00:35:41,752
Yes, it does.

490
00:35:43,383 --> 00:35:44,889
Well I have a show to do.

491
00:35:45,428 --> 00:35:47,183
Your checks at the desk.

492
00:35:48,106 --> 00:35:52,850
- Outstanding work, Lou.
- Thanks, Nina. That means an awful lot.

493
00:36:20,869 --> 00:36:25,325
It's every parents nightmare. Imagine singing
a lullaby to your infant and tucking them into bed...

494
00:36:25,588 --> 00:36:29,327
and then having to shield them as a barrage
of high caliber bullets...

495
00:36:29,411 --> 00:36:31,398
literally blasts into your home.

496
00:36:31,582 --> 00:36:35,518
For the Cahills of Echo Park, that fear
became a terrifying reality...

497
00:36:35,687 --> 00:36:40,433
when an adjacent house became the setting
for a scene right out of the wild west.

498
00:36:41,543 --> 00:36:44,110

Rick, I'm very pleased with how
you've progressed.

507
00:38:44,724 --> 00:38:45,877
You're doing a great job.

508
00:38:46,468 --> 00:38:48,914
However, you just spilled gasoline on
my car which will eat the paint.

509
00:38:49,044 --> 00:38:50,656
I need you to tighten up a bit on this.

510
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:54,239
Because if you spill it like that again I will
terminate you immediately, I promise you.

That's a good store.

is what it's all about.

00:39:40,552 --> 00:39:42,693
Living will attain that, right?

515
00:39:43,429 --> 00:39:44,483
Don't you think?

516
00:39:44,798 --> 00:39:47,259
<i>[Scanner] Traffic units Benedict Canyon</i>

517
00:39:47,343 --> 00:39:48,885
<i>overturned vehicle with injuries.</i>

518
00:39:48,969 --> 00:39:51,439
Crash with injuries, good neighborhood.

519
00:39:55,384 --> 00:39:56,768
TV news, what happened?

520
00:39:56,938 --> 00:40:01,273
I think it was a head on collision. There's
a guy who's dead over there. There's a woman...

521
00:40:01,391 --> 00:40:03,171
- Did you see what happened?
- Am I supposed to help move...

522
00:40:03,256 --> 00:40:04,165
I didn't see it. I came after...

523
00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:07,082
- Can you tell me exactly what happened.
- Will you get the camera out of my face!

524
00:40:07,407 --> 00:40:10,271
Get it out! I'm trying to talk to 911!

525
00:40:11,243 --> 00:40:13,974
No, the guys down.

526
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:14,900
Already through here.

527
00:42:16,511 --> 00:42:17,989
Son of a bitch.

528
00:42:19,721 --> 00:42:21,298
Oh, fuck this!

529
00:42:23,554 --> 00:42:24,687
Here you go.

530
00:42:28,644 --> 00:42:31,141
Ben Waterman wears the same
gold tie on Fridays.

531
00:42:31,676 --> 00:42:34,933
We're leading with it. That's your 3rd
start this week.

532
00:42:36,042 --> 00:42:37,537
I'm focusing on framing.

533
00:42:38,162 --> 00:42:40,866
A proper frame not only draws the eye
into a picture but...

534
00:42:41,038 --> 00:42:42,318
keeps it there longer.

535
00:42:42,402 --> 00:42:45,311
dissolving the barrier between the
subject and the outside of the frame.

536
00:42:47,176 --> 00:42:48,746
Is that blood on your shirt?

537
00:42:50,062 --> 00:42:51,373
I don't think so.

538
00:42:52,558 --> 00:42:55,747
I recently heard of a Mexican restaurant
called Cabanita.

539
00:42:55,831 --> 00:42:58,722
- Have you heard of it?
- It's also on your sleeve.

540
00:43:00,038 --> 00:43:01,467
I didn't see that.

541
00:43:04,189 --> 00:43:06,885
What I'm asking is do you like
Mexican food, Nina?

542
00:43:08,158 --> 00:43:09,053
Yes.

543
00:43:12,105 --> 00:43:15,675
Cabanita has been called an authentic
taste of Mexico City.

544
00:43:18,274 --> 00:43:20,778
Do you want to go with me? I think
we could have fun together.

545
00:43:21,972 --> 00:43:23,417
Thanks but I'm busy.

546
00:43:23,608 --> 00:43:26,262
- Saturday is your night off, isn't it?
- I have a rule, Lou I...

547
00:43:26,841 --> 00:43:28,541
I don't date people I work with.

548
00:43:28,975 --> 00:43:30,384
And I'm twice your age.

549
00:43:30,838 --> 00:43:32,029
I like older women.

550
00:43:32,914 --> 00:43:35,216
Besides I don't work with you. You're
someone I sell to.

551
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:37,267
And I don't want to fuck that up.

552
00:43:37,968 --> 00:43:40,112
What if by saying no you fuck it up?

553
00:43:42,336 --> 00:43:44,049
Is that what you're saying?

554
00:43:45,902 --> 00:43:47,768
I didn't say that.

555
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:52,431
Well I don't know what to say.

556
00:43:54,538 --> 00:43:56,617
<i>Good morning and thank you for joining us,
I'm Lisa Mays.</i>

557
00:43:56,701 --> 00:44:00,016
<i>I am the Ben Waterman. First up this
morning on KWLA News...</i>

558
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:04,278
<i>A horrible car crash over on Benedict Canyon
it's claimed the life now of one man...</i>

559
00:44:04,494 --> 00:44:06,509
<i>and severely injured a young woman.</i>

560
00:44:08,475 --> 00:44:09,687
Hey, Lou.

561
00:44:11,458 --> 00:44:13,664
Hey man, Joe Loder, Mayhem.

562
00:44:14,498 --> 00:44:15,873
Really good tonight.

563
00:44:16,296 --> 00:44:18,214
They closed it down by the time we
showed up.

564
00:44:18,806 --> 00:44:20,165
You were waiting for me out here?

565
00:44:20,806 --> 00:44:22,794
No I was driving by, I saw your car.

566
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:25,772
You're not dropping your shit off
are you? Nobody does that.

567
00:44:26,198 --> 00:44:28,390
You need an Air Card if you want to be
in the game.

568
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:31,520
Import the video to your laptop,
cut the video...

569
00:44:31,844 --> 00:44:35,181
upload to the FTP site and notify the
stations you have something for sale.

570
00:44:35,496 --> 00:44:36,782
Boom, boom, boom.

571
00:44:37,334 --> 00:44:39,424
Otherwise, it's a nice ride.

572
00:44:40,282 --> 00:44:43,626
Listen man, you've got a good run going,
but there's valleys out there.

573
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:46,192
Take it from me. I've been night crawling
14 years.

574
00:44:46,617 --> 00:44:47,917
You heard I'm adding a second van?

575
00:44:48,001 --> 00:44:51,037
- No, I didn't know that.
- That'll be a game changer.

576
00:44:51,702 --> 00:44:53,762
Cut my on scene time in half...

577
00:44:54,035 --> 00:44:55,517
I'm setting up a dedicated dispatch too.

578
00:44:55,601 --> 00:44:58,283
No more listening and driving. That's
for suckers.

579
00:44:58,367 --> 00:45:00,189
Do you like the Canon 305?

580
00:45:00,836 --> 00:45:02,902
- I never used one.
- $6,000 a piece.

581
00:45:03,148 --> 00:45:07,465
2.4 megapixels, night vision and 18:1 zoom.

582
00:45:07,753 --> 00:45:09,823
I've got one of those puppies with
your name on it.

583
00:45:10,164 --> 00:45:11,295
I have a camera.

584
00:45:11,604 --> 00:45:13,417
I want you running my second van.

585
00:45:13,501 --> 00:45:15,756
Two crews, half the area to cover.

586
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:18,340
I know what you're thinking.
Half the money, right?

587
00:45:18,755 --> 00:45:20,552
You should be thinking twice the sales.

588
00:45:20,761 --> 00:45:23,154
Cause we're gonna be the first to every scene.

589
00:45:23,473 --> 00:45:25,229
Why compete when we can work together?

590
00:45:25,762 --> 00:45:29,225
I'll share my press cards, puppy dog off
my police connections.

591
00:45:29,703 --> 00:45:32,140
This is the big move, the next level.

592
00:45:32,353 --> 00:45:33,557
We'd corner this whole thing.

593
00:45:33,642 --> 00:45:35,987
I'm talking about putting some heavy digits
in our pocket, bra.

594
00:45:36,170 --> 00:45:39,344
Thank you for offering me the position,
but working for myself...

595
00:45:39,504 --> 00:45:41,906
is more in line with my skills and career goals.

596
00:45:44,028 --> 00:45:45,510
Take a few days to think about it.

597
00:45:45,594 --> 00:45:46,424
No!

598
00:45:46,509 --> 00:45:49,036
You need to hire someone else and I
don't want to hold up the process.

599
00:45:49,197 --> 00:45:53,586
You want to be on the inside of this cause I'm
gonna be tag teaming every call.

600
00:45:53,973 --> 00:45:55,647
You keep talking like...

601
00:45:56,270 --> 00:45:59,058
it's something that I may be interested in,
but I'm not.

602
00:45:59,395 --> 00:46:01,023
You don't even understand the offer.

603
00:46:01,534 --> 00:46:03,852
If you did you'd be fucking sucking
my dick!

604
00:46:04,156 --> 00:46:06,701
You're asking me questions. What does this
mean. What does that mean.

605
00:46:07,330 --> 00:46:08,361
I feel like...

606
00:46:08,742 --> 00:46:10,783
grabbing you by your ears right now...

607
00:46:11,288 --> 00:46:12,873
and screaming in your face...

608
00:46:13,507 --> 00:46:15,609
"I'm not fucking interested."

609
00:46:17,481 --> 00:46:20,600
Instead, I'm gonna drive home and do
some accounting.

610
00:46:24,828 --> 00:46:25,882
Fuck you.

611
00:46:26,644 --> 00:46:27,924
Twerp.

612
00:46:40,764 --> 00:46:42,736
Didn't wake up til 5.

613
00:46:43,675 --> 00:46:45,799
My body's so off I feel like it's time for...

614
00:46:46,248 --> 00:46:47,127
breakfast.

615
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:53,500
I bet you're beautiful every time of the day.

616
00:46:53,915 --> 00:46:54,811
In fact...

617
00:46:55,562 --> 00:46:58,136
I'd say you're much prettier than Lisa Mays.

618
00:47:01,148 --> 00:47:04,714
I like the dark makeup on your eyes.
I also like the way you smell.

619
00:47:07,867 --> 00:47:09,438
So where you from, Lou?

620
00:47:11,562 --> 00:47:13,618
The north end of the valley.

621
00:47:14,766 --> 00:47:16,396
Some of the calls sometimes take
me over there...

622
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:18,479
but nobody I know still lives out there.

623
00:47:19,243 --> 00:47:21,222
You're from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

624
00:47:21,465 --> 00:47:22,773
How'd you know that?

625
00:47:23,634 --> 00:47:24,762
It's online.

626
00:47:26,244 --> 00:47:29,379
Everything about you's online. Not everything,
but definitely a lot.

627
00:47:29,833 --> 00:47:33,203
I've watched all videos from when you were a
reporter. I'm sure you've looked at those of course.

628
00:47:33,309 --> 00:47:36,314
No, god no. Not without a drink
in my hand.

629
00:47:37,352 --> 00:47:39,183
I watch my work all the time.

630
00:47:39,889 --> 00:47:42,301
- You want to become a reporter?
- No.

631
00:47:43,605 --> 00:47:45,317
Most of you guys want airtime.

632
00:47:45,401 --> 00:47:46,661
Not me.

633
00:47:47,162 --> 00:47:49,727
I want to be the guy that owns the
station that owns the camera.

634
00:47:50,677 --> 00:47:52,785
The business is going well, but...

635
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:54,568
In order to grow to the next level...

636
00:47:55,022 --> 00:47:57,614
I need to stay one step ahead of my
competition and take risks.

637
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:00,417
I also need financial support to
implement expansion.

638
00:48:02,071 --> 00:48:03,768
Would you like another margarita?

639
00:48:04,956 --> 00:48:06,256
One is enough.

640
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:08,843
Thank you for coming out to talk.

641
00:48:10,109 --> 00:48:12,588
The place I'm in now, is that I...

642
00:48:12,906 --> 00:48:15,679
want a relationship with someone I
can team up with...

643
00:48:16,238 --> 00:48:18,902
And share, the same job and hours
and what not.

644
00:48:18,986 --> 00:48:21,005
I could do another laundry list, but
you get the idea.

645
00:48:21,101 --> 00:48:22,000
Yes.

646
00:48:22,592 --> 00:48:24,517
Well I hope you find someone.

647
00:48:26,234 --> 00:48:28,119
Here's the thing about that, Nina.

648
00:48:28,906 --> 00:48:30,735
I'm quite certain I already have.

649
00:48:33,511 --> 00:48:34,504
Okay.

650
00:48:35,848 --> 00:48:37,540
Let me put this politely.

651
00:48:37,949 --> 00:48:42,939
I only came out to dinner with you Lou,
purely as a professional courtesy.

652
00:48:44,950 --> 00:48:45,923
Thank you.

653
00:48:48,604 --> 00:48:51,524
I don't think it's any secret that I've
single handedly raised the unit price...

654
00:48:51,609 --> 00:48:52,884
for your ratings book.

655
00:48:54,584 --> 00:48:55,683
Uh...

656
00:48:55,768 --> 00:48:59,214
ratings book price?! Whoa.

657
00:49:00,312 --> 00:49:01,716
I'm a very fast learner.

658
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:04,993
We had a conversation where I specifically
mentioned that. Do you remember that?

659
00:49:06,594 --> 00:49:08,557
- Well do you?
- Yes.

660
00:49:09,212 --> 00:49:11,422
I recently learned for instance that...

661
00:49:11,888 --> 00:49:14,678
most Americans watch local news
to stay informed.

662
00:49:16,339 --> 00:49:19,316
I also learned that the average half hour
of LA television news...

663
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:21,536
packs all of it's local government
coverage...

664
00:49:21,759 --> 00:49:25,591
including law enforcement, budget,
transportation, education and immigration...

665
00:49:25,675 --> 00:49:27,350
into 22 seconds.

666
00:49:27,436 --> 00:49:30,332
Local crime stories however not only usually
lead the news,

667
00:49:30,507 --> 00:49:33,504
but filled 14 times the broadcast adding
in 5 minutes and 7 seconds.

668
00:49:33,687 --> 00:49:36,125
KWLA relies heavily on such stories.

669
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:38,533
With Los Angeles crime rates going down...

670
00:49:38,617 --> 00:49:41,556
I think that makes items like mine
particularly valuable.

671
00:49:41,803 --> 00:49:43,604
Like rare animals.

672
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:48,287
I can only imagine that your needs will
increase during next months ratings period.

673
00:49:50,714 --> 00:49:53,768
Whoo! Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

674
00:49:54,801 --> 00:49:58,775
Yeah, well we certainly appreciate
what you do.

675
00:50:05,134 --> 00:50:07,645
There are certain good things about
being alone.

676
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:13,894
You have time to do the things you want
to do, like study and plan, but...

677
00:50:14,270 --> 00:50:16,717
you can't have dinners like this or be
physical with a person...

678
00:50:16,801 --> 00:50:18,638
I mean that's not a flirtation-ship.

679
00:50:21,139 --> 00:50:22,956
Where are you going with this?

680
00:50:25,207 --> 00:50:26,390
I want that.

681
00:50:28,878 --> 00:50:29,980
With you.

682
00:50:33,176 --> 00:50:35,668
Like you want to keep your job
and your health insurance.

683
00:50:38,213 --> 00:50:38,870
Look.

684
00:50:39,178 --> 00:50:43,638
Just for starters, I don't need you to
keep my fucking job!

685
00:50:44,508 --> 00:50:47,263
You're the news director, on the
Rampart shift...

686
00:50:47,576 --> 00:50:51,374
at the lowest rated station in Los Angeles.

687
00:50:54,429 --> 00:50:57,439
We have what could be considered an
almost exclusive relationship...

688
00:50:58,381 --> 00:51:00,381
there are many other places I could go.

689
00:51:01,275 --> 00:51:04,254
I have to think that you are invested in
this transaction.

690
00:51:04,650 --> 00:51:05,838
[Waiter] Here you are.

691
00:51:06,566 --> 00:51:08,355
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

692
00:51:11,936 --> 00:51:15,354
Where did you get the balls to even
suggest something like this?

693
00:51:16,266 --> 00:51:18,039
- We're still talking.
- No!

694
00:51:18,392 --> 00:51:20,840
- There's nothing more to say.
- You can leave.

695
00:51:27,941 --> 00:51:30,934
Well okay, look, you've done well.

696
00:51:31,689 --> 00:51:34,421
Okay? And we pay you well, very well.

697
00:51:34,608 --> 00:51:35,917
We always have.

698
00:51:36,001 --> 00:51:40,027
If you like, I can get you an exclusive retainer.

699
00:51:40,436 --> 00:51:42,518
That would be on top of your segment fees.

700
00:51:42,956 --> 00:51:46,617
I could maybe even get you a job at the station
starting as a production assistant...

701
00:51:46,701 --> 00:51:48,805
so that you could learn the business from
the inside.

702
00:51:48,890 --> 00:51:50,689
That's where you said your interests lie.

703
00:51:50,929 --> 00:51:51,999
Uh huh.

704
00:51:52,936 --> 00:51:54,503
You're not listening, Nina.

705
00:51:55,870 --> 00:51:58,917
I happen to know that you haven't stayed at
one station for longer than 2 years at a time...

706
00:51:59,001 --> 00:52:01,256
and you're coming up on 2 years soon.

707
00:52:04,619 --> 00:52:07,085
I can imagine that your contract is
for that length of time...

708
00:52:07,299 --> 00:52:09,470
and next months ratings directly
affect that.

709
00:52:10,032 --> 00:52:12,788
So you're threatening that if I don't...

710
00:52:13,309 --> 00:52:15,869
- I'm negotiating.
- You're threatening to stop selling to me.

711
00:52:16,227 --> 00:52:17,510
That's your choice.

712
00:52:18,311 --> 00:52:21,189
The true price of any item is what
somebody's is willing to pay for it.

713
00:52:21,273 --> 00:52:22,840
You want something...

714
00:52:23,256 --> 00:52:24,576
and I want you.

715
00:52:25,210 --> 00:52:26,262
To fuck you.

716
00:52:27,050 --> 00:52:28,473
And as a friend.

717
00:52:29,019 --> 00:52:33,112
Jesus Christ. Friends don't pressure friends
to fucking sleep with them.

718
00:52:34,310 --> 00:52:36,471
Oh see, that's not true, Nina.

719
00:52:38,433 --> 00:52:40,522
For then I'm sure you know...

720
00:52:41,975 --> 00:52:43,145
a friend...

721
00:52:43,938 --> 00:52:46,076
is your gift to give yourself.

722
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:21,953
Okay left on Roth and then 6 blocks to
the ramp.

723
00:53:22,099 --> 00:53:23,376
You're putting me on the 5?!

724
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:25,657
Yeah, to the 5 then the 110 to the 10.

725
00:53:26,015 --> 00:53:28,113
Did you read my traffic memo yesterday?

726
00:53:28,654 --> 00:53:29,809
Did I read it?

727
00:53:30,733 --> 00:53:33,089
- Yeah I read it.
- What did it say?

728
00:53:34,287 --> 00:53:35,323
About the 5.

729
00:53:35,975 --> 00:53:37,580
I looked at it okay, why?

730
00:53:37,664 --> 00:53:41,597
Well for one thing it included that the 5 has
construction in the fast lane the next few weeks...

731
00:53:41,681 --> 00:53:45,376
so given that I expect you to put me onto
the 2 to the 101 to the 110 to the 10.

732
00:53:45,709 --> 00:53:49,303
- That's half of one, six of the other.
- It's "Half dozen of one, six of the other".

733
00:53:49,441 --> 00:53:51,922
What I'd like you to do is admit that you
didn't read what you said you did.

734
00:53:52,039 --> 00:53:54,835
You know I'm a reasonable person,
but no one likes to be lied to.

735
00:53:54,919 --> 00:53:58,782
Okay, then when am I gonna get my raise?!
That's reasonable right?

736
00:53:58,866 --> 00:54:01,631
You keep talking about this performance
review. When's it gonna happen?

737
00:54:01,716 --> 00:54:04,499
Been out here 2 months already busting
my ass every night.

738
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:06,918
I'm tired of your promises for more pay...

739
00:54:07,002 --> 00:54:08,933
- and I'm sleeping in a garage.
- Rick!

740
00:54:09,054 --> 00:54:11,878
Trying to leverage your salary in this
economic environment is near impossible.

741
00:54:11,962 --> 00:54:15,892
Most firms have set starting wages. Ideally
you could leverage with other offers...

742
00:54:15,976 --> 00:54:18,605
but that's just not the case in
this situation right now.

- No, I have that stabbing in Corona.
- Where's the plane crash at Foothill?

766
00:56:00,330 --> 00:56:03,851

you stories that happened here on the ground.

trying not to be too hard on myself.

fucking sweeps savior.

- So you want that then?
- I want you to get in the goddamn game!

777
00:56:33,304 --> 00:56:35,692
I want something that people
can't turn away from.

Since when did Coldwater become
faster than Laurel?

787
00:58:11,849 --> 00:58:13,257
What was the thinking there?

788
00:58:14,558 --> 00:58:18,756
- I didn't ask that to hear myself speak.
- Because you know Coldwater only has six lights.

789
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:22,309
But Laurel has places to pass. I can't
get around this person until Ventura.

790
00:58:22,967 --> 00:58:24,376
It's a silly argument, man.

791
00:58:24,486 --> 00:58:27,403
I said this route, you wanted to take
Laurel, you should've said something.

792
00:58:27,487 --> 00:58:29,017
I thought that you worked in other factors.

793
00:58:29,101 --> 00:58:32,567

I wouldn't ride you so hard about the routes.

I think you know that, Rick.

795
00:58:34,350 --> 00:58:38,558

than you have of yourself.

Who cares. What's the rush?

799
00:58:50,642 --> 00:58:53,667

at high rate of speed...

00:59:35,418 --> 00:59:37,053
probably toward Griffith Park...

809
00:59:37,315 --> 00:59:40,785
when apparently they ran head on into
this light pole and another car.

810
00:59:42,519 --> 00:59:44,670

01:07:45,916 --> 01:07:48,363
We could have had someone out there
by now. Why didn't you call?

851
01:07:48,447 --> 01:07:50,956
To increase the need and prove my
value in person.

852
01:07:52,585 --> 01:07:54,722
Frank, Jenny, bay 2 now!

853
01:08:23,723 --> 01:08:25,329
Get Linda in here.

854
01:08:36,335 --> 01:08:37,759
Home invasion in Granada.

855
01:08:38,138 --> 01:08:40,871
He got there before the cops with 10
minutes jail time.

856
01:08:40,956 --> 01:08:42,442
How much of this can we show?

857
01:08:43,437 --> 01:08:44,516
You man legally?

858
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:46,672
No morally.  Of course legally.

859
01:08:47,037 --> 01:08:48,057
Have they been identified?

860
01:08:48,141 --> 01:08:51,390
It just happened so you have to assume no
and that's just one of the issues.

861
01:08:51,474 --> 01:08:54,572
You can't broadcast their identities
without notifying the next of kin.

862
01:08:54,656 --> 01:08:57,512
- We're not identifying them.
- You are by proxy by showing their faces.

863
01:08:57,596 --> 01:08:59,413
We pixelate the faces.

864
01:08:59,965 --> 01:09:01,866
- Where did you get this?
- A stringer.

865
01:09:02,220 --> 01:09:03,538
Hi Linda, I'm Lou.

866
01:09:04,017 --> 01:09:06,197
Oh Jesus, is that a dead baby
inside of there?

867
01:09:06,358 --> 01:09:07,659
No, the crib was empty.

868
01:09:07,841 --> 01:09:10,823
Well for Christ's sake, are we breaking
the law by showing this?

869
01:09:13,309 --> 01:09:16,621
Dot the faces, don't give out the exact
address. Do that...

870
01:09:16,997 --> 01:09:18,999
I guess, I do not know...

871
01:09:19,183 --> 01:09:20,599
I wouldn't think so, no.

872
01:09:20,777 --> 01:09:22,930
- Journalistically and ethically...
- This isn't Hartford.

873
01:09:23,014 --> 01:09:25,224
We are beyond all broadcast standards.

874
01:09:25,310 --> 01:09:26,982
Have you seen the overnights?

875
01:09:27,350 --> 01:09:28,700
I'll risk the fine.

876
01:09:29,114 --> 01:09:32,714
- What did you pay for this?
- The price hasn't be negotiated yet.

877
01:09:33,700 --> 01:09:35,205
Give us a moment.

878
01:09:35,289 --> 01:09:36,363
Thanks.

879
01:09:41,100 --> 01:09:43,129
- How much?
- $100,000.

880
01:09:43,608 --> 01:09:45,449
- How much?
- $ 50,000.

881
01:09:45,819 --> 01:09:47,800
I need a number. In 9 minutes
I need a number.

882
01:09:47,901 --> 01:09:48,986
I just gave you 2.

883
01:09:49,516 --> 01:09:50,488
$ 3,000.

884
01:09:50,818 --> 01:09:52,537
You paid $3,000 for the food truck
stabbings.

885
01:09:52,621 --> 01:09:53,666
There were more dead.

886
01:09:53,750 --> 01:09:55,824
Those were poor Mexican people in
a roach coach.

887
01:09:55,926 --> 01:09:56,957
2 of them were illegals.

888
01:09:57,075 --> 01:10:00,064
These are 3 wealthy white people, shot
and killed in their mansion.

889
01:10:00,151 --> 01:10:02,728
Including a suburban housewife shotgunned
in her bed.

890
01:10:02,812 --> 01:10:04,152
I know you, Nina.

891
01:10:04,393 --> 01:10:07,635
I know your interest and excitement is
greater than the amount you're offering.

892
01:10:15,316 --> 01:10:17,065
- $ 5,000.
- $ 30,000.

893
01:10:17,273 --> 01:10:18,216
- $ 7,000.
- $ 25,000.

894
01:10:18,300 --> 01:10:19,216
- $ 8,000.
- $ 15,000.

895
01:10:19,300 --> 01:10:20,659
- $ 9,000.
- $ 15,000.

896
01:10:21,460 --> 01:10:22,516
- $ 10,000.
- $ 15,000.

897
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:25,357
- Give me a serious number.
- $ 15,000.

898
01:10:25,653 --> 01:10:28,866
Can't do it, never happen, it's a matter
of price. 10 is my last best offer.

899
01:10:29,390 --> 01:10:30,262
Okay.

900
01:10:31,567 --> 01:10:32,402
Really?

901
01:10:32,874 --> 01:10:34,112
Where are you going?

902
01:10:35,009 --> 01:10:37,091
7 has approached me at least several
times.

903
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:38,866
Dan Vito gave me his number.

904
01:10:39,249 --> 01:10:41,288
They'll make me a better offer. It's
a 5 minute drive.

905
01:10:41,386 --> 01:10:42,606
Hold on!

906
01:10:49,912 --> 01:10:50,697
12.

907
01:10:51,379 --> 01:10:52,122
15.

908
01:10:52,206 --> 01:10:55,102
I can't spend a months budget on a single story.

909
01:10:55,294 --> 01:10:56,683
What if the story's not over?

910
01:10:57,596 --> 01:10:58,935
The people who did this escaped.

911
01:10:59,453 --> 01:11:02,245
They're still out there. Walking around
with the rest of us.

912
01:11:03,060 --> 01:11:05,811
If I had a family and I lived in a home,
that might make me nervous.

913
01:11:06,097 --> 01:11:07,916
I'd want updates on what was going on.

914
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:11,048
With this footage, people would turn to
your channel for the story.

915
01:11:11,893 --> 01:11:13,123
Now I like you, Nina.

916
01:11:13,770 --> 01:11:15,473
And I look forward to our time together.

917
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:18,121
But you have to understand $15,000...

918
01:11:18,332 --> 01:11:19,348
isn't all that I want.

919
01:11:19,973 --> 01:11:21,637
From here on, starting now...

920
01:11:21,812 --> 01:11:24,206
I want my work to be credited by the
editors on a burn.

921
01:11:24,667 --> 01:11:27,270
The name of my company is
Video Production News...

922
01:11:27,354 --> 01:11:28,917
a professional news gathering service.

923
01:11:29,001 --> 01:11:31,236
That's how it should be read and that's
how it should be said.

924
01:11:32,261 --> 01:11:34,863
I also want to go to the next rung, and
meet your team.

925
01:11:35,224 --> 01:11:37,397
And the station manager and
the Director and the anchors.

926
01:11:37,481 --> 01:11:39,399
And start developing my own personal
relationships.

927
01:11:39,550 --> 01:11:41,004
I'd like to start meeting them this morning.

928
01:11:41,122 --> 01:11:43,470
You'll take me around and introduce me as the
owner and president of...

929
01:11:43,555 --> 01:11:44,615
Video Production News.

930
01:11:44,700 --> 01:11:47,200
And remind them of some of my many
other stories.

931
01:11:47,897 --> 01:11:48,766
I'm not done.

932
01:11:49,091 --> 01:11:51,511
I also want to stop our discussion
over prices.

933
01:11:51,605 --> 01:11:52,707
This will save time.

934
01:11:52,792 --> 01:11:55,565
So when I say a number is my lowest price,
that's my lowest price.

935
01:11:55,649 --> 01:11:58,623
And you can be assured that I arrived at
whatever that number is very carefully.

936
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:00,400
Now when I say...

937
01:12:00,923 --> 01:12:02,646
that I want these things...

938
01:12:03,726 --> 01:12:07,223
I mean that I want them. And I don't
want to have to ask again.

939
01:12:07,700 --> 01:12:09,017
And the last thing that I want, Nina...

940
01:12:09,101 --> 01:12:12,116
is for you to do the things that I ask you
to do when we're alone in your apartment.

941
01:12:12,200 --> 01:12:13,638
Not like the last time!

942
01:12:18,039 --> 01:12:18,772
So...

943
01:12:21,281 --> 01:12:22,299
I'll tell you what.

944
01:12:24,133 --> 01:12:25,717
I have the van crash on Moorpark tonight...

945
01:12:25,801 --> 01:12:27,500
with a couple of stringers actually.

946
01:12:27,789 --> 01:12:29,932
That could lead by itself on an
average night.

947
01:12:30,884 --> 01:12:33,128
I'd be willing to throw that in for free.

948
01:12:35,664 --> 01:12:37,533
What do you say, do we have a deal?

949
01:12:41,445 --> 01:12:43,726
Lisa Mays, Ben Waterman, Lou Bloom.

950
01:12:43,810 --> 01:12:45,733
- Hi, pleasure to meet you.
- Hello, how are you, Lisa?

951
01:12:45,817 --> 01:12:48,255
You remember Lou from the
Benedict Canyon crash.

952
01:12:48,367 --> 01:12:49,517
- Oh yeah, great stuff.
- Good stuff.

953
01:12:49,601 --> 01:12:51,722
That was my company, Video Production News.

954
01:12:51,806 --> 01:12:55,417
I would just like to say, that I think that
what the 2 of you do...

955
01:12:55,502 --> 01:12:56,902
is incredibly valuable.

956
01:12:57,055 --> 01:12:58,386
- Thank you. That's very kind.
- Very kind of you.

957
01:12:58,470 --> 01:12:59,270
We appreciate it.

958
01:13:00,410 --> 01:13:02,510
I do not know how long this tape runs
in like that.

959
01:13:02,697 --> 01:13:04,817
20 seconds to back. Ben and Lisa
20 seconds to back.

960
01:13:04,901 --> 01:13:06,983
Set the standard #22 jump.

961
01:13:07,334 --> 01:13:08,235
Where is the banner?

962
01:13:08,639 --> 01:13:10,509
- Did you decide on one?
- Horror House.

963
01:13:10,760 --> 01:13:12,007
- What do you talk about?
- Hold on.

964
01:13:12,091 --> 01:13:14,917
- Put it on CZ1.
- Back in ten seconds.

965
01:13:15,001 --> 01:13:15,753
Nine...

966
01:13:15,837 --> 01:13:18,321
Eight, seven, six...

967
01:13:18,679 --> 01:13:21,289
Five, four, three...

968
01:13:21,736 --> 01:13:23,416
Two, one...

969
01:13:23,500 --> 01:13:24,694
spin it.

970
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:28,316
Lights, dissolve, cue.

971
01:13:28,401 --> 01:13:30,917
<i>Hello everybody, this is KWLA with
breaking news...</i>

972
01:13:31,001 --> 01:13:32,611
<i>Over the last half hour or so...</i>

973
01:13:32,695 --> 01:13:36,321
<i>we've now received word of a home
invasion triple homicide.</i>

974
01:13:36,619 --> 01:13:38,617
In the Granada Hills area of the
San Fernando Valley.

975
01:13:38,701 --> 01:13:40,917
Now at present, the number of those dead...

976
01:13:41,001 --> 01:13:42,917
<i>- has not been confirmed yet by police...</i>
- Prep camera 2.

977
01:13:43,001 --> 01:13:48,128
<i>but KWLA has obtained exclusive footage
from inside the crime scene...</i>

978
01:13:48,329 --> 01:13:50,467
<i>in which at least three bodies can
be observed.</i>

979
01:13:50,551 --> 01:13:53,139
<i>Now we're going to show you segments
of that footage...</i>

980
01:13:53,224 --> 01:13:54,794
<i>throughout the rest of this broadcast
of course...</i>

981
01:13:54,901 --> 01:13:56,566
<i>but also throughout the day...</i>

982
01:13:56,651 --> 01:13:59,254
Now Lisa, have the tape. When you're ready
let's go to it. I'll follow you.

983
01:13:59,350 --> 01:14:05,016
<i>Again, we're about to show you exclusive
KWLA video from inside the crime scene.</i>

984
01:14:05,100 --> 01:14:08,142
- It's graphic, repeat it!
<i>- Before broadcasting this video...</i>

985
01:14:08,226 --> 01:14:11,874
<i>we want to warn our viewers that these
are extremely graphic images.</i>

986
01:14:12,083 --> 01:14:14,823
<i>and I'm hearing from my control room
that we have that video.</i>

987
01:14:14,907 --> 01:14:16,707
<i>- and they're gonna show it now.
- Let's roll it now.</i>

988
01:14:16,791 --> 01:14:19,966
<i>This is footage that was obtained
exclusively by KWLA...</i>

989
01:14:20,050 --> 01:14:21,316
<i>from Video Production News</i>

990
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:23,617
<i>this is a professional news gathering
service.</i>

991
01:14:23,701 --> 01:14:25,918
<i>And this is what appears to be a shotgun.</i>

992
01:14:26,002 --> 01:14:27,957
<i>something you might use for home defense...</i>

993
01:14:28,314 --> 01:14:32,324
<i>We can see the pistol grips on the front and
back. Quite possibly the murder weapon.</i>

994
01:14:32,772 --> 01:14:35,478
<i>Now, Lisa, as we move inside, this is
a beautiful home.</i>

995
01:14:35,562 --> 01:14:37,982
<i>A beautiful home in a very safe neighborhood.</i>

996
01:14:38,066 --> 01:14:40,953
<i>or what most people think is a safe
neighborhood. It appears...</i>

997
01:14:41,184 --> 01:14:42,988
<i>- that is the first body.
- There's the body.</i>

998
01:14:43,478 --> 01:14:47,045
<i>A young woman, I'm guessing from this
angle, on a sofa.</i>

999
01:14:47,254 --> 01:14:49,763
<i>All of the faces have been blurred out.</i>

1000
01:14:49,848 --> 01:14:51,334
They escaped, they're on the loose.

1001
01:14:51,418 --> 01:14:55,798
<i>That is the first of what we understand are 3
bodies in the home in Granada Hills...</i>

1002
01:14:55,882 --> 01:14:59,230
<i>and this was committed by a suspect or
suspects...</i>

1003
01:14:59,424 --> 01:15:02,327
<i>who are still out there. They are
believed to have escaped.</i>

1004
01:15:02,500 --> 01:15:04,998
<i>and if you think about that, that is a
very frightening thought.</i>

1005
01:15:05,082 --> 01:15:05,775
Repeat that!

1006
01:15:05,862 --> 01:15:09,551
<i>Yes scary and very concerning, particularly
given what we're looking at.</i>

1007
01:15:09,635 --> 01:15:14,849
<i>The savagery of what these pictures show.
There on the floor Lisa, I'm guessing what is that...</i>

1008
01:15:15,177 --> 01:15:17,969
<i>- A bloodied article of clothing.
- Seems like a silk shirt.</i>

1009
01:15:18,053 --> 01:15:21,241
<i>- Maybe a woman's silk blouse.
- It's so sad. Now as we move...</i>

1010
01:15:21,328 --> 01:15:23,158
<i>- to one of the bedrooms.</i>
- Dissolve to camera 2.

1011
01:15:23,242 --> 01:15:25,497
There obviously is the second body.

1012
01:15:25,717 --> 01:15:27,218
<i>- The person or the people...</i>
They escaped. Repeat it!

1013
01:15:27,302 --> 01:15:29,719
<i>who committed all of this brutal
home invasion robbery...</i>

01:15:29,803 --> 01:15:33,227
<i>they're presently unidentified and at
large. Still on the streets there.</i>

1015
01:15:33,318 --> 01:15:34,730
Hit it again, harder!

1016
01:15:34,814 --> 01:15:39,116
<i>has got to be a huge worry, not only to the
residents in this neighborhood, Granada Hills...</i>

1017
01:15:39,200 --> 01:15:43,290
<i>- All of Los Angeles if you think about it.
- The entire Southland tonight, absolutely.</i>

1018
01:15:43,495 --> 01:15:45,417
<i>An apparent family...</i>

1019
01:15:45,501 --> 01:15:48,000
<i>savagely killed, we believe this is
their own home.</i>

1020
01:15:48,556 --> 01:15:50,866
<i>in what is one of the quieter...</i>

1021
01:15:50,951 --> 01:15:53,928
<i>frankly more upscale and
affluent neighborhoods.</i>

1022
01:15:54,101 --> 01:15:56,309
<i>- In the whole valley.
- In all of Los Angeles.</i>

1023
01:15:56,529 --> 01:15:59,071
<i>And now as we're moving, this is
a nursery.</i>

1024
01:15:59,155 --> 01:16:00,591
<i>- And you hope to god that there’s not a...</i>
- Build it!

1025
01:16:00,866 --> 01:16:02,270
<i>a baby in that crib.</i>

1026
01:16:02,522 --> 01:16:06,779
<i>We're just praying that that crib is empty,
cause this is definitely a child's room.</i>

1027
01:16:06,973 --> 01:16:09,500
<i>And now as you look, thank goodness...</i>

1028
01:16:09,747 --> 01:16:12,569
<i>- In fact our understanding is that
there was no baby found...</i>

1029
01:16:12,796 --> 01:16:14,974
<i>in the house or any baby that was
seen at all...</i>

1030
01:16:15,058 --> 01:16:17,017
<i>by the people who filmed this for us.
</i>

1031
01:16:17,101 --> 01:16:19,417
<i>- Thank goodness.
- Again that's Video News...</i>

1032
01:16:19,501 --> 01:16:21,919
<i>a professional news gathering service
that we use.</i>

1033
01:16:22,195 --> 01:16:24,427
<i>Apparently what we're hearing from
their photographer...</i>

1034
01:16:24,511 --> 01:16:27,817
<i>is that they arrived even before
the police...did...</i>

1035
01:16:27,901 --> 01:16:32,016
<i>and then entered this home to help or
at least offer some sort of assistance...</i>

1036
01:16:32,100 --> 01:16:33,996
<i>and then came upon what you're
looking at here...</i>

1037
01:16:34,167 --> 01:16:36,334
<i>- A gruesome crime scene.
- He came upon 3 bodies.</i>

1038
01:16:36,541 --> 01:16:38,917
<i>- And that right there is the 3rd body.
- There's the third body.</i>

1039
01:16:39,001 --> 01:16:42,617
<i>Obviously this is a man, gray hair, what
do you think Lisa, maybe 40, 50?...</i>

1040
01:16:42,701 --> 01:16:44,917
<i>- Yeah 50's maybe even 60.</i>
- Vicious attack!

1041
01:16:45,001 --> 01:16:47,998
<i>The only thought I have, we've been
looking at all this graphic footage...</i>

1042
01:16:48,303 --> 01:16:51,830
<i>- just the viciousness, the severity of it.</i>
- Stand by master control we're coming to a break here.

1043
01:16:51,914 --> 01:16:53,769
We're going to commercial then
cutting to Joe...

1044
01:16:53,853 --> 01:16:56,198
- and a police statement.
<i>- I'm getting word right now that the police...</i>

1045
01:16:56,304 --> 01:16:58,529
<i>are getting ready to issue a statement...</i>

1046
01:16:58,700 --> 01:17:01,374
<i>- from the scene and Joel Beatty is there for that... </i>
- Ready camera 2.

1047
01:17:01,578 --> 01:17:05,200
<i>- I think right now we're gonna take a quick break...</i>
- Tape 2, take a break in five...

1048
01:17:05,301 --> 01:17:07,717
<i>- with more to come on this vicious home...</i>
- Four, synching music, three....

1049
01:17:07,801 --> 01:17:11,309
<i>- invasion in Granada Hills.</i>
- Two, one, fade to black.

1050
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:12,801
That's a ten.

1051
01:17:14,026 --> 01:17:15,517
I want theme music on the return...

1052
01:17:15,601 --> 01:17:17,531
the cut we used for the scene we
all crash.

1053
01:17:17,615 --> 01:17:20,100
Audio, cut 32 please cut 32 when
we come back.

1054
01:17:24,787 --> 01:17:25,498
Hello?

1055
01:17:27,041 --> 01:17:28,063
Thank you.

1056
01:17:29,613 --> 01:17:31,444
Well actually he'd like to meet you.

1057

<i>Heads up you guys, the police spokesman...</i>

<i>- is making an announcement in 60 seconds.</i>
- I've gotta go.

1059
01:17:38,838 --> 01:17:42,422
Nina, we are getting a ton of heat from
the police out here about that video.

1060
01:17:42,956 --> 01:17:45,306
- Tell them to call the station.
- 15 seconds.

1061
01:17:45,390 --> 01:17:47,221
They want to talk to the person who
shot it.

1062
01:17:47,305 --> 01:17:48,316
I shot it!

1063
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:51,700
Joel it's Video Production News.
Tell them to call me.

1064
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:53,186
Lou, they can't hear you.

1065
01:17:53,270 --> 01:17:54,530
Coming back in five...

1066
01:17:54,900 --> 01:17:55,699
Four...

HORROR HOUSE

1072
01:18:05,503 --> 01:18:08,665
<i>We have more information coming in
from the Granada Hills area...</i>

1073
01:18:08,749 --> 01:18:10,820
<i>and a scene of an apparent home invasion...</i>

1074
01:18:10,905 --> 01:18:13,484
<i>that has left a husband and wife and
their housekeeper...</i>

1075
01:18:13,723 --> 01:18:16,516
<i>What we know at the moment is that

1076
01:18:16,600 --> 01:18:18,822
<i>gunmen broke into this upscale...</i>

1077
01:18:18,906 --> 01:18:21,963
<i>Citizens are concerned and disturbed by
the brutal triple murder...</i>

1078
01:18:22,047 --> 01:18:24,117
<i>The way we got it though is that a
video production crew...</i>

1079
01:18:24,201 --> 01:18:25,654
<i>that we work with from time to time...</i>

1080
01:18:25,738 --> 01:18:28,127
<i>they apparently arrived on the scene
in Granada Hills...</i>

1081
01:18:28,326 --> 01:18:30,429
<i>- before the police ever got there.
- Before anybody.</i>

1082
01:18:30,513 --> 01:18:35,098
<i>And the photographer who took those pictures
told us earlier that he walked up to the door...</i>

1083
01:18:35,225 --> 01:18:37,682
<i>he saw what we all saw in his video tape...</i>

1084
01:18:37,863 --> 01:18:40,950
<i>and then he started to look inside so
that he could help...</i>

1085
01:18:41,035 --> 01:18:42,515
<i>or render assistance to someone...</i>

1086
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:45,383
<i>that's when he walked into the house and
started shooting the video.</i>

1087
01:18:45,498 --> 01:18:47,917
<i>- [Knocking on the door]
- He found the 3 deceased in the house...</i>

1088
01:18:48,001 --> 01:18:49,905
<i>the 3 females and the one...</i>

1089
01:19:01,748 --> 01:19:03,038
- Hello
- Hi.

1090
01:19:03,122 --> 01:19:05,769
I'm Detective Frontieri and this
is my partner Detective Lieberman.

1091
01:19:06,229 --> 01:19:08,194
- Are you Louis Bloom?
- Yes, I'm Lou.

1092
01:19:08,956 --> 01:19:09,757
You live here?

1093
01:19:10,182 --> 01:19:12,143
- Yes, that's right.
- May we come inside?

1094
01:19:12,484 --> 01:19:13,792
- Why?
- Why not?

1095
01:19:13,985 --> 01:19:15,559
- You want to?
- Yes.

1096
01:19:15,896 --> 01:19:18,347
- I don't care.
- Wonderful.

1097
01:19:23,556 --> 01:19:26,306
- You were in Granada Hills last night.
- Yes, that's right.

1098
01:19:27,031 --> 01:19:28,244
Shot the video in the house?

1099
01:19:28,626 --> 01:19:30,645
Yes, ma'am, I did. That's right.

1100
01:19:30,852 --> 01:19:32,515
You went inside the house, you...

1101
01:19:32,956 --> 01:19:34,597
filmed all through the house?

1102
01:19:35,136 --> 01:19:36,515
Even filmed the bodies.

1103
01:19:37,116 --> 01:19:39,701
- All before the police came.
- That door was open, ma'am.

1104
01:19:39,958 --> 01:19:40,599
Detective.

1105
01:19:40,757 --> 01:19:43,224
The door was open and what I did, was...

1106
01:19:43,775 --> 01:19:46,449
I went in to see if I could help,
because the alarm was ringing.

1107
01:19:46,657 --> 01:19:49,427
- The active crime scene.
- I didn't know it was a crime scene.

1108
01:19:50,886 --> 01:19:52,177
You knew what it was.

1109
01:19:52,488 --> 01:19:54,556
I know that an alarm means
someone is in trouble.

1110
01:19:54,751 --> 01:19:56,802
And then sold it to be shown on TV.

1111
01:19:57,175 --> 01:19:59,259
We're a professional news gathering service.

1112
01:19:59,609 --> 01:20:00,910
What did you see when you arrived?

1113
01:20:01,545 --> 01:20:03,762
Two men leaving in a vehicle.

1114
01:20:04,192 --> 01:20:05,249
You saw two men.

1115
01:20:05,420 --> 01:20:08,139
It was the shapes, I was afraid so I hid...

1116
01:20:08,558 --> 01:20:12,069
And then I saw the shapes of two men
moving inside the vehicle. If that helps.

1117
01:20:12,526 --> 01:20:14,702
- Describe the men.
- It was dark.

1118
01:20:14,952 --> 01:20:17,461
- And then they drove away. I...
- Black, white, tall?...

1119
01:20:17,545 --> 01:20:19,626
- I couldn't see.
- What were they driving?

1120
01:20:20,220 --> 01:20:21,085
An SUV.

1121
01:20:21,716 --> 01:20:22,722
Dark-colored.

1122
01:20:23,241 --> 01:20:24,671
Rims, tinted windows?

1123
01:20:25,110 --> 01:20:27,269
Maybe. Not that I saw.

1124
01:20:27,623 --> 01:20:29,570
Do you have any film on the men
or the car?

1125
01:20:29,993 --> 01:20:32,642
No I don't. I only started filming when
I was inside.

1126
01:20:33,996 --> 01:20:35,801
I'd like a copy of that footage.

1127
01:20:36,185 --> 01:20:38,100
Do I have to give it to you?

1128
01:20:38,559 --> 01:20:40,432
Is there any reason why you wouldn't?

1129
01:20:40,742 --> 01:20:43,564
No, no. I made you a copy. I expected
someone to come.

AUTO LICENSE PLATE SEARCH

1131

1133
01:21:53,047 --> 01:21:54,560
What's wrong man?

1134
01:21:55,752 --> 01:21:57,760
I'm tired. Aren't you tired?

1135
01:21:58,472 --> 01:22:00,497
Why we starting so early?

1136
01:22:01,015 --> 01:22:04,365
One of the people in the house
last night was alive.

1137
01:22:05,712 --> 01:22:07,085
I cut that part out.

1138
01:22:07,831 --> 01:22:09,830
I also cut out the men leaving in their car.

1139
01:22:10,036 --> 01:22:11,322
I have a name and an address.

1140
01:22:11,406 --> 01:22:13,805
We're gonna drive their. We're gonna
find the person that drove that car.

1141
01:22:15,708 --> 01:22:18,259
So, you know who killed
those people?

1142
01:22:18,751 --> 01:22:20,551
One of them, quite possibly yes.

1143
01:22:21,771 --> 01:22:25,638
- You gotta call the cops.
- And we will, at the right time.

1144
01:22:34,201 --> 01:22:35,365
I'm offering you...

1145
01:22:35,824 --> 01:22:37,795
a real opportunity here, Rick.

1146
01:22:38,174 --> 01:22:39,806
To do what?

1147
01:22:43,338 --> 01:22:45,506
I don't usually share my business
plan with you.

1148
01:22:47,068 --> 01:22:50,192
But a moment has arrived, that could
allow the company...

1149
01:22:50,386 --> 01:22:53,183
to make enough money to expand
to the next level.

1150
01:22:54,720 --> 01:22:56,257
We could call this...

1151
01:22:59,433 --> 01:23:01,024
the critical moment.

1152
01:23:02,499 --> 01:23:06,301
I'm inviting you Rick, to be part of the
team that pounces on this opportunity.

1153
01:23:07,374 --> 01:23:09,506
You've been asking a lot about your
performance review?

1154
01:23:09,949 --> 01:23:11,600
- Yeah.
- Well...

1155
01:23:13,008 --> 01:23:14,212
for starters...

1156
01:23:15,136 --> 01:23:18,511
I've been seeing a great improvement in
your overall focus and order following.

1157
01:23:19,789 --> 01:23:24,140
Given complex problems, you're developing a
real ability to find clear and simple solutions.

1158
01:23:24,224 --> 01:23:26,274
I am also aware of your
increasing enthusiasm.

1159
01:23:26,741 --> 01:23:28,954
It's great to see your eyes light up when
you're working on a new idea.

1160
01:23:29,212 --> 01:23:33,170
I hope that you're inspiring us with your
innovative thinking for years to come.

1161
01:23:35,423 --> 01:23:38,367
Thank you man. I'm trying, you know.

1162
01:23:39,662 --> 01:23:41,175
Which is why I'm promoting you...

1163
01:23:41,981 --> 01:23:43,973
to Executive Vice President...

1164
01:23:44,793 --> 01:23:46,600
of video news.

1165
01:23:48,893 --> 01:23:50,427
What am I now?

1166
01:23:51,431 --> 01:23:52,916
You're an assistant.

1167
01:23:55,856 --> 01:23:57,403
That...

1168
01:24:02,505 --> 01:24:04,074
Does it come with a raise?

1169
01:24:04,846 --> 01:24:05,998
Absolutely.

1170
01:24:07,011 --> 01:24:08,198
How much?

1171
01:24:09,929 --> 01:24:12,138
Pick a number. You pick a number.

1172
01:24:16,919 --> 01:24:19,260
100...

1173
01:24:20,905 --> 01:24:25,541
$75 per night?

1174
01:24:26,901 --> 01:24:27,888
Agreed.

1175
01:24:29,908 --> 01:24:32,525
Hey, what about more?

1176
01:24:32,635 --> 01:24:34,058
Not now.

1177
01:24:34,353 --> 01:24:35,410
We closed the deal.

1178
01:24:38,771 --> 01:24:40,733
I could have gotten more, couldn't I?!

1179
01:24:40,925 --> 01:24:41,955
Absolutely.

1180
01:24:44,932 --> 01:24:46,735
Alright it's coming up on the left.

1181
01:24:47,432 --> 01:24:51,355
Halfway down the block. 1701 North Burns.

1182
01:25:01,968 --> 01:25:03,788
- Is that car?
- That's the car.

1183
01:25:04,100 --> 01:25:05,311
Oh shit.

1184
01:25:27,184 --> 01:25:29,623
- Do you think there's a reward?
- There is a reward.

1185
01:25:30,430 --> 01:25:32,118
- How much?
- 50,000.

1186
01:25:33,901 --> 01:25:37,003
- Do I get any of that?
- I just give you a raise.

1187
01:25:38,398 --> 01:25:40,852
But that's salary, I mean like a bonus.

1188
01:25:41,056 --> 01:25:43,640
Bonuses come at the end of the year.

1189
01:25:52,094 --> 01:25:54,198
- So you gonna call it in?
- Gonna wait.

1190
01:25:54,485 --> 01:25:55,281
For what?

1191
01:25:55,430 --> 01:25:56,817
First we want to see if he's actually inside...

1192
01:25:56,901 --> 01:25:59,878
and then we want to find a more interesting
place to film the arrest.

1193
01:26:01,109 --> 01:26:02,372
Like where?

1194
01:26:04,900 --> 01:26:06,314
Anywhere we want.

1195
01:26:06,970 --> 01:26:10,061
What we're gonna do is we're gonna wait
and then we're gonna follow...

1196
01:26:10,539 --> 01:26:13,464
and when we reach a road that's in a better or
more populated neighborhood...

1197
01:26:13,548 --> 01:26:15,516
then we'll report it's location
to the police.

1198
01:26:15,737 --> 01:26:17,889
He's a violent wanted criminal. I
can't believe...

1199
01:26:18,047 --> 01:26:20,213
he's just gonna peacefully surrender.

1200
01:26:26,972 --> 01:26:29,010
Okay, I want more money.

1201
01:26:29,880 --> 01:26:31,180
A lot more.

1202
01:26:40,036 --> 01:26:43,815
What makes a job desirable, Rick isn't
just the dollar amount attached to it.

1203
01:26:44,072 --> 01:26:47,533
You're at the ground floor of a growing
business. Your reward is a career.

1204
01:26:47,742 --> 01:26:51,316
Fuck that. You're talking about some
seriously messed up shit.

1205
01:26:51,400 --> 01:26:55,247
You're just expecting me to just go along
with it. I want more.

1206
01:26:55,552 --> 01:26:56,948
I can't make people do things, Rick.

1207
01:26:57,032 --> 01:27:00,016
You have a choice if you want to do this
and I have a choice if you don't.

1208
01:27:02,189 --> 01:27:03,952
You trying to fire me?

1209
01:27:04,806 --> 01:27:07,894
Hey I've got something too. How about
not calling in criminals...

1210
01:27:08,058 --> 01:27:11,716
waiting for them to start some shit so you
can film it. That's against the fucking law.

1211
01:27:12,058 --> 01:27:14,900
Yeah cops would be really interested
in that no doubt.

1212
01:27:15,406 --> 01:27:18,241
Okay so I want more money.

1213
01:27:21,502 --> 01:27:23,579
We can re-open negotiations , Rick.

1214
01:27:24,362 --> 01:27:27,029
But remember, when it comes to your
work reputation...

1215
01:27:27,113 --> 01:27:28,609
you can't unring the bell.

1216
01:27:29,614 --> 01:27:32,038
Well, I want half of whatever we make today.

1217
01:27:33,319 --> 01:27:35,084
How did you arrive at that number?

1218
01:27:35,712 --> 01:27:38,449
Just two of us sat here, so...

1219
01:27:38,637 --> 01:27:41,250
- fifty/fifty.
- I counter at 10,000.

1220
01:27:42,065 --> 01:27:45,420
You don't set the numbers on this. I
want half! I want half.

1221
01:27:47,245 --> 01:27:49,723
Well if you're saying I can't negotiate,
then listen.

1222
01:27:57,946 --> 01:27:59,757
Just gonna have to give it to you.

1223
01:28:03,333 --> 01:28:05,050
Well alright then.

1224
01:28:06,443 --> 01:28:10,640
Now I can feel good about it. At
least now I'll go the extra mile.

1225
01:28:11,927 --> 01:28:15,363
That's what you never understood, man.
It's been the problem all the time.

1226
01:28:17,606 --> 01:28:22,007
You gotta bring people in, Lou, seriously. You
gotta talk to them like they're fucking human beings.

1227
01:28:22,352 --> 01:28:25,534
I'm saying this for you dude, for the future.
To help you.

1228
01:28:26,384 --> 01:28:29,122
Because you got a seriously weird ass
way of looking at shit.

1229
01:28:30,254 --> 01:28:31,583
You know you do.

1230
01:28:32,762 --> 01:28:36,368
The trouble is man, you don't fucking
understand people.

1231
01:28:38,433 --> 01:28:39,207
Okay?

1232
01:28:42,298 --> 01:28:43,750
I'll take the first watch.

1233
01:28:45,450 --> 01:28:46,400
Okay.

1234
01:29:11,170 --> 01:29:12,523
Guys inside.

1235
01:29:13,624 --> 01:29:14,789
He's leaving.

1236
01:29:18,379 --> 01:29:20,819
- Is that him?
- That's one of them.

1237
01:30:03,709 --> 01:30:05,427
You're too fucking close, man.

1238
01:30:06,034 --> 01:30:07,200
Oh shit.

1239
01:30:08,967 --> 01:30:10,217
We're too fucking close.

1240
01:30:10,301 --> 01:30:13,483
This guy might have already seen us and
he's pulling us in as a trap.

1241
01:30:15,818 --> 01:30:17,192
You ever think of that?

1242
01:30:22,031 --> 01:30:23,104
Oh shit.

1243
01:31:02,246 --> 01:31:05,162
They're gonna see us. We're in a
red fucking car.

1244
01:31:07,827 --> 01:31:09,586
Lower your window please.

1245
01:31:39,593 --> 01:31:42,079
- Keep your window down.
- I'm fucking cold.

1246
01:31:52,488 --> 01:31:54,294
Shit they're parking.

1247
01:31:54,997 --> 01:31:56,241
Keep going.

1248
01:32:14,658 --> 01:32:16,173
<i>911 what's your emergency?</i>

1249
01:32:16,650 --> 01:32:18,817
Ah, yes, good evening, hello. I'd like to
report the location of...

1250
01:32:18,901 --> 01:32:21,479
2 men responsible for the triple murder
in Granada Hills last night.

1251
01:32:22,332 --> 01:32:23,182
<i>What's your address?</i>

1252
01:32:23,448 --> 01:32:25,717
I followed them and they just pulled
in the Chinatown Express...

1253
01:32:25,801 --> 01:32:27,400
at Western and 3rd.

1254
01:32:27,950 --> 01:32:29,016
I can see them inside.

1255
01:32:29,100 --> 01:32:31,183
Okay, it's a restaurant called
Chinatown Express...

1256
01:32:31,267 --> 01:32:32,684
at Western and 3rd.

1257
01:32:32,768 --> 01:32:35,118
That's right. I can see them at the
counter and they're ordering.

1258
01:32:35,210 --> 01:32:37,513
These men are wanted for the triple
murder in Granada Hills last night.

1259
01:32:37,658 --> 01:32:39,588
<i>- What's your name, sir?
- Louis Bloom</i>

1260
01:32:39,700 --> 01:32:41,250
<i>Do you have a description of the men?</i>

1261
01:32:41,464 --> 01:32:43,320
Yes I do. They're both Latin American men.

1262
01:32:43,553 --> 01:32:45,836
Probably what you would call Hispanic.

1263
01:32:46,409 --> 01:32:49,025
One is big, very much on the heavy side...

1264
01:32:49,158 --> 01:32:51,686
and the other's face is scratched. There
are scratches on his face.

1265
01:32:52,121 --> 01:32:53,394
<i>How old are the men?</i>

1266
01:32:54,578 --> 01:32:57,780
30, perhaps 35.

1267
01:32:58,272 --> 01:32:59,371
<i>What are they wearing?</i>

1268
01:33:00,128 --> 01:33:02,217
The big man's wearing light pants and
a striped sweater...

1269
01:33:02,301 --> 01:33:04,383
and the man with scratches is wearing
brown pants...

1270
01:33:04,499 --> 01:33:06,228
and a vest, he looks like he has a...

1271
01:33:06,776 --> 01:33:07,724
gun!

1272
01:33:08,500 --> 01:33:09,852
<i>You said the suspect is armed?</i>

1273
01:33:09,968 --> 01:33:13,376
I believe so, yes. I'm sorry I have to
go, otherwise they might see me.

1274
01:33:25,892 --> 01:33:29,906
<i>[Scanner] All work units possible 187,
suspect is at Western and 3rd...</i>

1275
01:33:30,141 --> 01:33:33,491
<i>Western and 3rd at Chinatown Express.
Suspects are two male hispanics...</i>

1276
01:33:33,609 --> 01:33:36,116
<i>number 1 large build, number 2 with
scratches on his face.</i>

1277
01:33:36,200 --> 01:33:38,166
<i>inside the location and possibly armed</i>

1278
01:33:38,436 --> 01:33:41,532
<i>Code 3 Incident 357...</i>

1279
01:33:42,335 --> 01:33:44,315
There's fucking people in there.

1280
01:33:44,600 --> 01:33:47,465
I count six.

1281
01:33:47,948 --> 01:33:49,607
They could start shooting.

1282
01:33:50,914 --> 01:33:53,505
- They could.
- So you said we were waiting for...

1283
01:33:53,761 --> 01:33:56,161
a better neighborhood with more people,
not a fucking restaurant.

1284
01:33:56,271 --> 01:33:59,416
- We work with what we're given.
<i>- [Scanner] Unit 14 responding to that Code 3.</i>

1285
01:33:59,500 --> 01:34:02,904
You're going to go down the street and
get an angle inside from over there.

1286
01:34:03,827 --> 01:34:05,895
Steady hands, use your zoom...

1287
01:34:06,095 --> 01:34:08,287
no fast pans. I'll be filming from here.

1288
01:34:08,580 --> 01:34:10,768
Fuck that! I'm not getting out of the car!

1289
01:34:13,401 --> 01:34:16,542
I need a second angle from down the
street. We'll cut it together.

1290
01:34:17,140 --> 01:34:18,035
The two angles.

1291
01:34:18,603 --> 01:34:20,799
Believe me it's more dangerous
here in the car.

1292
01:34:21,114 --> 01:34:24,582
I don't believe anything you say.
This is fucked.

1293
01:34:25,555 --> 01:34:27,972
Do you know I've never once sworn in
front of an employer.

1294
01:34:28,281 --> 01:34:30,665
I'm not doing that. I'm not getting
out of the car.

1295
01:34:31,394 --> 01:34:32,555
You're making a mistake.

1296
01:34:33,089 --> 01:34:36,093
I don't care about the fucking job title.

1297
01:34:41,420 --> 01:34:43,816
What if my problem wasn't that I
don't understand people...

1298
01:34:43,900 --> 01:34:45,598
but that I don't like them?

1299
01:34:48,500 --> 01:34:51,467
What if I was obliged to hurt you for
something like this?

1300
01:34:53,533 --> 01:34:55,364
I mean, physically.

1301
01:34:56,750 --> 01:34:58,847
I think you'd have to believe afterward
if you could...

1302
01:34:59,314 --> 01:35:01,024
that agreeing to participate...

1303
01:35:01,737 --> 01:35:04,191
and then backing out at the critical
moment was a mistake.

1304
01:35:05,526 --> 01:35:07,177
Cause that's what I'm telling you.

1305
01:35:10,627 --> 01:35:11,496
As...

1306
01:35:12,121 --> 01:35:13,546
clearly...

1307
01:35:14,985 --> 01:35:16,312
as I can.

1308
01:36:35,660 --> 01:36:37,863
<i>[Scanner] 7-A-14, we're close to the location.</i>

1309
01:36:42,126 --> 01:36:44,986
<i>7-A-21 provide backing for 7-A-14.</i>

1310
01:37:42,624 --> 01:37:43,499
Oh, god.

1311
01:37:52,849 --> 01:37:55,645
<i>7-A-21, we're close in with 7-A-14.</i>

1312
01:38:14,700 --> 01:38:16,095
Oh my god.

1313
01:38:18,023 --> 01:38:19,371
Oh god.

1314
01:38:31,691 --> 01:38:32,502
Fuck!

1315
01:38:37,493 --> 01:38:40,988
<i>[Scanner] Shots fired! Shots fired!
Officer down. Officer needs help.</i>

1316
01:39:00,186 --> 01:39:00,988
Fuck!

1317
01:39:01,827 --> 01:39:04,360
- Did you get it?
- There's people dead in there!

1318
01:39:05,322 --> 01:39:08,323
<i>[Scanner] 7-A-27, I'm in pursuit of the
fleeing vehicle.</i>

1319
01:39:10,065 --> 01:39:11,407
<i>7-A-27 Roger.</i>

1320
01:39:11,885 --> 01:39:13,424
<i>All units on 350 standby...</i>

1321
01:39:13,509 --> 01:39:15,217
Aim the camera at the car and
start filming.

1322
01:39:15,301 --> 01:39:18,029
<i>7a-27 in pursuit...</i>

1323
01:39:18,300 --> 01:39:20,618
<i>The suspect vehicle is a black Escalade</i>

1324
01:39:22,540 --> 01:39:24,244
Rick, start filming!

1325
01:39:32,463 --> 01:39:34,851
<i>7-A-27, in pursuit on Western Street</i>

1326
01:39:34,935 --> 01:39:37,700
- Stay on the police car..
- You're right up his ass.

1327
01:39:38,065 --> 01:39:39,617
Wide angle. We want all of it.

1328
01:39:39,701 --> 01:39:41,506
<i>Requesting back up and an air unit.</i>

1329
01:39:41,807 --> 01:39:43,966
<i>All air units...</i>

1330
01:39:44,050 --> 01:39:45,734
- Lou, Lou, Lou!
- I got it.

1331
01:39:50,375 --> 01:39:52,868
<i>South bound, 70 miles/hour approaching
a bright red.</i>

1332
01:39:52,952 --> 01:39:54,066
Steady hands, Rick.

1333
01:39:54,782 --> 01:39:57,172
It's a red light. It's a red light.
Red light!

1334
01:39:58,600 --> 01:39:59,873
Holy shit!

1335
01:40:01,985 --> 01:40:06,275
<i>Give me an ETA on that air unit.</i>

1336
01:40:07,225 --> 01:40:10,028
<i>Air units ready for take off, standby.</i>

1337
01:40:13,954 --> 01:40:18,248
<i>Heading north bound Western. Suspect
approaching another bright red.</i>

1338
01:40:18,804 --> 01:40:19,713
Oh shit!

1339
01:40:21,647 --> 01:40:23,421
- 7a-27, come in.
- My God...

1340

- It's evidence.
- Of what?

1410
01:46:59,099 --> 01:47:01,350
I got a cop near death in a hospital.

1411
01:47:01,621 --> 01:47:05,591
3 dead, 4 wounded and a dozen major
crimes stretching a mile and a third.

- It's news footage...

- If there's an issue, speak to him.
- Don't get in the way of this.

01:47:34,800 --> 01:47:36,129
at the Granada Hills house.

1423
01:47:36,213 --> 01:47:39,765
Cocaine in wrapped packages, hidden in
crawl spaces, over 50 pounds...

1424
01:47:39,849 --> 01:47:42,498
and confirmed it with an investigator
at the scene.

1425
01:47:42,759 --> 01:47:45,344
It wasn't a home invasion. It was a
drug robbery.

1426
01:47:45,523 --> 01:47:47,170
Give it to the noon crew.

1427
01:47:48,336 --> 01:47:50,818
- This is news!
- It detracts from the story.

It is the story!

1429
01:47:52,847 --> 01:47:57,438
The story is urban crime, creeping into
the suburbs. That's the story.

1445
01:48:43,873 --> 01:48:48,127
Can you tell me how it is you were at the
Chinatown Express tonight and called 911.

1446
01:48:48,560 --> 01:48:49,270
Of course.

1447
01:48:49,663 --> 01:48:51,299
It began earlier in the day...

1448
01:48:52,764 --> 01:48:54,451
I was watering my plant.

1449
01:48:55,954 --> 01:49:00,002
I looked out my window in my apartment,
the one you visited...

1450
01:49:00,393 --> 01:49:04,566
and I saw a dark colored vehicle with 2 men
inside parked across the street.

1451
01:49:04,650 --> 01:49:07,469
I didn't think anything of it, otherwise
I would have reported it then.

1452
01:49:08,823 --> 01:49:09,973
We began our night...

1453
01:49:10,546 --> 01:49:11,624
my...

1454
01:49:13,841 --> 01:49:15,919
employee and myself.

1455
01:49:16,637 --> 01:49:19,047
And around approximately 12:38...

1456
01:49:19,637 --> 01:49:23,479
I looked in my rear-view mirror and I
saw what looked like the same men...

1457
01:49:23,956 --> 01:49:25,677
in the same vehicle following us.

1458
01:49:26,105 --> 01:49:28,242
I made an evasive maneuver, circled back...

1459
01:49:28,555 --> 01:49:30,247
And tailed them to the restaurant.

1460
01:49:30,389 --> 01:49:33,216
At which point I saw them go inside and
recognized them as the...

1461
01:49:33,300 --> 01:49:35,397
same men from the home invasion.

1462
01:49:35,880 --> 01:49:37,510
You told me you didn't see the men.

1463
01:49:37,807 --> 01:49:40,145
- You didn't get a good look at them.
- Well...

1464
01:49:40,582 --> 01:49:42,717
it all came back to me when I saw
them going in...

1465
01:49:42,801 --> 01:49:45,290
the shapes and the movements...

1466
01:49:46,105 --> 01:49:49,063
And then I saw that one of the men
had a gun under his shirt and so I...

1467
01:49:49,258 --> 01:49:51,543
immediately got my phone and dialed 911.

1468
01:49:51,941 --> 01:49:52,890
That's your story?

1469
01:49:53,097 --> 01:49:55,171
That's what happened, that's why I'm
sitting here with you.

1470
01:49:55,561 --> 01:49:56,549
I think that...

1471
01:49:57,040 --> 01:49:58,646
the men saw my footage and...

1472
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:00,547
they tracked me down.

1473
01:50:01,595 --> 01:50:03,274
Want to know what I think?

1474
01:50:04,715 --> 01:50:06,007
Yes, please.

1475
01:50:06,820 --> 01:50:09,052
I think you withheld information.

1476
01:50:10,112 --> 01:50:12,926
I think you saw the two men in the
murder house in Granada Hills...

1477
01:50:13,233 --> 01:50:14,534
and you saw the car...

1478
01:50:15,234 --> 01:50:16,625
and you sat on it.

1479
01:50:17,466 --> 01:50:19,384
To get something you could film.

1480
01:50:19,965 --> 01:50:21,839
What do you think about that?

1481
01:50:23,472 --> 01:50:25,248
I think that would be...

1482
01:50:25,664 --> 01:50:28,392
a very unprofessional thing for me to do
in my business.

1483
01:50:28,476 --> 01:50:29,864
It would be murder.

1484
01:50:30,838 --> 01:50:33,591
I can understand why you're looking
into, but I didn't do anything like that.

1485
01:50:33,745 --> 01:50:37,328
- Nothing that could be considered wrong.
- You don't fool me for a minute.

1486
01:50:37,412 --> 01:50:38,350
I'm glad.

1487
01:50:38,587 --> 01:50:41,551
I think everything you said is a lie.

1488
01:50:42,217 --> 01:50:44,319
I wish my partner was here to backup
what happened.

1489
01:50:44,499 --> 01:50:47,430
- You left your dead partner.
- Well, the ambulances arrived.

1490
01:50:47,537 --> 01:50:51,360
- They're trained professionals.
- Yeah you seem real broken up about that.

1491
01:50:51,655 --> 01:50:52,792
Well...

1492
01:50:53,291 --> 01:50:55,013
He died doing what he loved.

1493
01:50:56,611 --> 01:50:59,662
You filmed him, dying.

1494
01:51:01,052 --> 01:51:03,034
That's what I do, it's my job.
