(MultiCom Jingle)

2
00:00:15,027 --> 00:00:18,027
(suspenseful music)

3
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:37,103
(hooves pounding)

4
00:00:52,894 --> 00:00:56,561
- [Soldier] We mustn't
go back empty handed!

5
00:00:57,523 --> 00:01:00,672
- [Soldier] There's a stone clearing!

6
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:01,505
Up ahead!

7
00:01:05,235 --> 00:01:07,068
- [Soldier] I see her!

8
00:01:10,205 --> 00:01:12,955
- [Soldier] Don't let her escape!

9
00:01:16,045 --> 00:01:18,128
- [Soldier] There she is!

10
00:01:20,767 --> 00:01:23,017
(shouting)

11
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:29,428
- You, look over there.

12
00:01:29,428 --> 00:01:32,095
- [Soldier] You men, over there!

13
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:39,264
- [Soldier] This way!

14
00:01:40,565 --> 00:01:43,711
- [Soldier] There are tracks here!

15
00:01:43,711 --> 00:01:45,783
- [Soldier] She can't escape!

16
00:01:45,783 --> 00:01:49,950
(suspenseful music)
(panting)

17
00:01:52,163 --> 00:01:54,996
- [Soldier] There's nothing there!

18
00:01:59,192 --> 00:02:01,385
- Do you see anything?
(horse whinnying)

19
00:02:01,385 --> 00:02:04,385
(soldiers shouting)

20
00:02:38,808 --> 00:02:42,386
- I don't see her!
- You two, take the back!

21
00:02:42,386 --> 00:02:44,527
- [Girl] Merlin, Merlin!

22
00:02:44,527 --> 00:02:46,490
- [Soldier] Any sign of her?

23
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:49,010
- [Soldier] Where is she?

24
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:50,165
- [Soldier] Cha!

25
00:02:50,165 --> 00:02:52,915
(dramatic music)

26
00:02:57,723 --> 00:03:00,068
- [Girl] I brought it, Master Merlin!

27
00:03:00,068 --> 00:03:01,901
- You've been running!

28
00:03:02,818 --> 00:03:04,654
- The Devil Soldiers are everywhere.

29
00:03:04,654 --> 00:03:05,743
No place is safe.

30
00:03:05,743 --> 00:03:08,243
- Come child, sit by the fire.

31
00:03:09,081 --> 00:03:11,581
(crow cawing)

32
00:03:30,129 --> 00:03:34,296
(crow cawing)
Oh, the Glass of Babylon.

33
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:36,603
I bid thee wait!

34
00:03:38,938 --> 00:03:41,924
By the rune that is
Lithil I bid thee wake.

35
00:03:41,924 --> 00:03:45,507
By the rune that is
blood, I bid thee wake.

36
00:03:47,765 --> 00:03:50,182
By the power of fire and ice,

37
00:03:51,057 --> 00:03:54,107
by the power of steel and storm!

38
00:03:54,107 --> 00:03:58,274
(eerie ringing)
(rumbling)

39
00:04:02,489 --> 00:04:06,022
By the power of the most ancient,

40
00:04:06,022 --> 00:04:08,169
I bid thee wake!
(magical thundering)

41
00:04:08,169 --> 00:04:09,748
(gasping)
(crow cawing)

42
00:04:09,748 --> 00:04:13,016
And open the way to he who will save us!

43
00:04:13,016 --> 00:04:14,764
To the unborn child!

44
00:04:14,764 --> 00:04:18,931
(eerie humming)
(magical zapping)

45
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:24,222
(eerie humming)

46
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:27,305
(thunderous booming)

47
00:04:30,426 --> 00:04:33,120
(mystical humming)

48
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,703
(girl gasping)

49
00:04:38,292 --> 00:04:40,792
(man gasping)

50
00:04:45,778 --> 00:04:46,611
Sprout!

51
00:04:51,397 --> 00:04:53,420
Bear the mirror to the place of safety,

52
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:56,386
and take care, all depends upon it now.

53
00:04:56,386 --> 00:04:58,508
- Shall we be saved, then?

54
00:04:58,508 --> 00:05:02,258
- Our only hope, lies
in the hands of a hero,

55
00:05:06,737 --> 00:05:09,737
Who may not be born, for 1000 years.

56
00:05:14,611 --> 00:05:17,444
(magical ringing)

57
00:05:21,486 --> 00:05:24,236
(dramatic music)

58
00:06:22,948 --> 00:06:26,597
- Now, the moment you've
all been waiting for,

59
00:06:26,597 --> 00:06:28,466
here's Johnny!

60
00:06:28,466 --> 00:06:29,694
(audience applauding)

61
00:06:29,694 --> 00:06:31,208
- Thank you, thank you.

62
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:34,112
Welcome one and all, thank you.

63
00:06:34,112 --> 00:06:38,112
And now Assistant, the
pitcher of water, please.

64
00:06:39,803 --> 00:06:42,303
Is this pitcher full of water?

65
00:06:44,147 --> 00:06:46,707
- Water.
- Now Assistant, please may I

66
00:06:46,707 --> 00:06:48,541
have the newspaper?

67
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:49,541
Now observe!

68
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,353
And...

69
00:06:56,059 --> 00:07:00,226
(kids laughing)
(water splashing)

70
00:07:10,919 --> 00:07:13,252
And now the, the magic ring!

71
00:07:15,755 --> 00:07:17,868
- Mysto, you did that one already.

72
00:07:17,868 --> 00:07:19,451
- Oh, yes, so yeah.

73
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:23,640
And now, the...

74
00:07:25,365 --> 00:07:27,948
The, the rabbit out of the hat!

75
00:07:28,932 --> 00:07:32,932
- Aw man, this is stupid,
let's get out of here.

76
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,612
- Come on, guys, rabbit out of the hat!

77
00:07:38,612 --> 00:07:40,777
An oldie but a goodie!

78
00:07:40,777 --> 00:07:42,944
Hey, I promise it'll work!

79
00:07:47,686 --> 00:07:51,618
- Hey, it's better than last time, right?

80
00:07:51,618 --> 00:07:52,997
- Yeah I guess.

81
00:07:52,997 --> 00:07:56,300
- Come on, they're a
bunch of jerks, anyway.

82
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:59,542
Let's go catch a flick,
have some fun, right?

83
00:07:59,542 --> 00:08:02,700
- I gotta go work on my
disappearing cabinet trick.

84
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:06,867
- Hey Johnny, how do you get
the water out of this thing?

85
00:08:11,462 --> 00:08:14,545
(melodramatic music)

86
00:08:15,528 --> 00:08:17,020
- Uh-hmm.

87
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:19,437
Yeah, yes, I did my homework.

88
00:08:21,072 --> 00:08:23,580
Um, Glen's over, okay?

89
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:24,413
Thank you.

90
00:08:25,878 --> 00:08:28,295
Yeah, how's the Grand Canyon?

91
00:08:30,094 --> 00:08:33,123
All right, well, I'll
talk to you later, okay?

92
00:08:33,123 --> 00:08:34,290
I love you too.

93
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:35,123
Bye.

94
00:08:37,268 --> 00:08:39,889
- Oh, did you hang up on your mother?

95
00:08:39,889 --> 00:08:42,245
- Yeah.
- I wanted to talk to her.

96
00:08:42,245 --> 00:08:45,203
Get cleaned up, dinner's almost ready.

97
00:08:45,203 --> 00:08:47,894
- Could we just wait five
minutes, Blackmoor's on!

98
00:08:47,894 --> 00:08:50,644
- Oh, magic, magic, always magic!

99
00:08:52,096 --> 00:08:56,852
You should play soccer like
I did when I was your age!

100
00:08:56,852 --> 00:08:58,482
- Okay Rose.

101
00:08:58,482 --> 00:09:00,087
- Thank you, thank you!

102
00:09:00,087 --> 00:09:01,721
- Wish I had an assistant like that!

103
00:09:01,721 --> 00:09:02,873
- As you can see,

104
00:09:02,873 --> 00:09:05,981
this cabinet has no place to hide.

105
00:09:05,981 --> 00:09:09,627
And now my dear, step into the cabinet.

106
00:09:09,627 --> 00:09:11,963
(assistant grunting)

107
00:09:11,963 --> 00:09:13,081
- [Assistant] Bring me back!

108
00:09:13,081 --> 00:09:14,593
- [Blackmoor] In...

109
00:09:14,593 --> 00:09:16,660
And we'll say the magic word,

110
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:19,095
- Spin, you are, spin...
- Tomaru,

111
00:09:19,095 --> 00:09:21,548
tomara, tomaru tomara--

112
00:09:21,548 --> 00:09:24,142
- Hey, that's from Barney!

113
00:09:24,142 --> 00:09:25,308
- Shh!

114
00:09:25,308 --> 00:09:27,141
- And spin, and voila!

115
00:09:31,668 --> 00:09:32,501
Thank you!

116
00:09:37,273 --> 00:09:38,273
Ah, and now,

117
00:09:39,422 --> 00:09:40,357
- Amazing!
- Spin in the

118
00:09:40,357 --> 00:09:41,623
opposite direction!

119
00:09:41,623 --> 00:09:42,835
- He's the best!
- and if you--

120
00:09:42,835 --> 00:09:43,668
- Yeah if he's the best,

121
00:09:43,668 --> 00:09:45,978
how come he's on cable access?

122
00:09:45,978 --> 00:09:47,519
- Politics!

123
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,813
- What?
- The other magicians

124
00:09:48,813 --> 00:09:50,164
are jealous!
- Tomaru,

125
00:09:50,164 --> 00:09:52,774
tomaru!
- I can't figure it out!

126
00:09:52,774 --> 00:09:55,120
Is she still inside the box
or did she get out somehow?

127
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,982
- Why don't you just go and ask him?

128
00:09:56,982 --> 00:09:59,183
- Yeah right, like he'd tell me!

129
00:09:59,183 --> 00:10:01,005
You know magicians don't
tell their secrets.

130
00:10:01,005 --> 00:10:01,888
- Of course they do, what do you think,

131
00:10:01,888 --> 00:10:03,707
they learn it over and over again?

132
00:10:03,707 --> 00:10:05,678
No, they tell each other!

133
00:10:05,678 --> 00:10:08,529
Professional to professional.

134
00:10:08,529 --> 00:10:11,518
And you're a professional, colleague!

135
00:10:11,518 --> 00:10:14,351
A fellow magician, he'll tell you.

136
00:10:17,686 --> 00:10:20,519
- Yeah, I am a colleague aren't I?

137
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,770
(rattling)

138
00:10:31,481 --> 00:10:32,314
Oh man!

139
00:10:35,251 --> 00:10:36,311
Got any more bright ideas?

140
00:10:36,311 --> 00:10:38,561
- [Glenn] Hey hey, hey hey!

141
00:10:41,671 --> 00:10:42,516
- [Johnny] Good!

142
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:43,349
Come on!

143
00:10:46,162 --> 00:10:47,658
- Honey for goodness sake!

144
00:10:47,658 --> 00:10:49,509
I mean we've gone through
this so many times

145
00:10:49,509 --> 00:10:51,155
now it's getting late!

146
00:10:51,155 --> 00:10:53,593
Now this is for the last time please,

147
00:10:53,593 --> 00:10:56,864
get it right this time, it's very simple!

148
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:59,506
When I come out with this blue cloth with

149
00:10:59,506 --> 00:11:02,034
the silver stripes on
it, I want you to use

150
00:11:02,034 --> 00:11:06,034
camera number one from
the back, you understand?

151
00:11:07,377 --> 00:11:11,544
Then you switch to camera
two, for this swing out part,

152
00:11:12,872 --> 00:11:16,520
the next trick will be with the cane!

153
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:19,266
You can take this again,
with camera number one,

154
00:11:19,266 --> 00:11:21,366
from way in back.

155
00:11:21,366 --> 00:11:24,366
(fantastical music)

156
00:11:27,007 --> 00:11:27,840
- Mm, hmm,

157
00:11:30,975 --> 00:11:33,475
oh!
(clapping)

158
00:11:37,104 --> 00:11:40,131
- And now Harry, we're
going to do this week's

159
00:11:40,131 --> 00:11:43,048
new attraction, the great illusion!

160
00:11:47,823 --> 00:11:50,073
(rattling)

161
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:53,888
Ah!
- It's stuck again!

162
00:11:53,888 --> 00:11:55,076
(grunting)

163
00:11:55,076 --> 00:11:57,094
- That's it Harry, that's it!

164
00:11:57,094 --> 00:12:00,791
I've had it, going back,
no more do you hear me?

165
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:02,204
(Assistant whimpering)

166
00:12:02,204 --> 00:12:03,704
- [Assistant] Sid!

167
00:12:04,887 --> 00:12:07,470
- Um, Mr. Blackmoor, excuse me.

168
00:12:11,062 --> 00:12:12,312
- Who, are you?

169
00:12:13,887 --> 00:12:16,679
- This is Glenn, and I'm,

170
00:12:16,679 --> 00:12:19,842
I'm Johnny Mysto, I'm a magician.

171
00:12:19,842 --> 00:12:22,675
- Yeah, well congratulation.
- Sid?

172
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:24,425
Sid?
- Yeah yeah yeah!

173
00:12:26,024 --> 00:12:27,859
(Assistant whimpering)

174
00:12:27,859 --> 00:12:28,692
- Go!

175
00:12:40,453 --> 00:12:41,784
- I-I just wanted to say that I think

176
00:12:41,784 --> 00:12:43,724
you're the greatest magician in the world.

177
00:12:43,724 --> 00:12:45,995
(screaming)

178
00:12:45,995 --> 00:12:47,745
- Stupid thing, oh...

179
00:12:48,948 --> 00:12:52,504
Take a break nah, take
two breaks, they're small!

180
00:12:52,504 --> 00:12:54,177
(grunting)

181
00:12:54,177 --> 00:12:56,427
(slamming)

182
00:13:02,872 --> 00:13:03,872
Abracadabra!

183
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:09,377
(sighing)

184
00:13:12,005 --> 00:13:13,418
- Mr. Blackmoor?

185
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:14,637
- Hey look kids, I'm not in the mood for

186
00:13:14,637 --> 00:13:17,868
autographs today, ok, do you mind?

187
00:13:17,868 --> 00:13:19,107
What's the matter, you deaf?

188
00:13:19,107 --> 00:13:22,297
- I, I don't want your
autograph Mr. Blackmoor.

189
00:13:22,297 --> 00:13:25,150
I mean, it's not that I don't
want it, it-it, it's just,

190
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:27,884
that that's not why I came.

191
00:13:27,884 --> 00:13:30,217
Um, you see, I'm a magician.

192
00:13:31,765 --> 00:13:33,144
- A fellow magician.

193
00:13:33,144 --> 00:13:35,492
- Look could we speed this up a bit huh?

194
00:13:35,492 --> 00:13:38,214
- Uh, well I was trying to duplicate

195
00:13:38,214 --> 00:13:40,075
the disappearing cabinet trick and,

196
00:13:40,075 --> 00:13:42,481
and well I, I just can't
get it right and I,

197
00:13:42,481 --> 00:13:45,224
I was wondering if--
- Wondering what?

198
00:13:45,224 --> 00:13:46,584
How I did it?

199
00:13:46,584 --> 00:13:49,580
- Well, I know magician's never
tell their secrets, but...

200
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:51,937
- Ah but a has-been like me,

201
00:13:51,937 --> 00:13:54,082
just might make an exception, huh?

202
00:13:54,082 --> 00:13:54,915
- No!

203
00:13:54,915 --> 00:13:56,041
It-it's just--

204
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:59,220
- You want to know my secrets?

205
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:01,053
Here, here, take this!

206
00:14:02,351 --> 00:14:04,432
It's all in there!

207
00:14:04,432 --> 00:14:05,515
- What is it?

208
00:14:06,565 --> 00:14:09,105
- What is it, it's the magic book!

209
00:14:09,105 --> 00:14:12,232
It's Lampsten Supply Warehouse,

210
00:14:12,232 --> 00:14:14,959
where you make somebody disappear,

211
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:18,157
levitation, saw a woman in half,

212
00:14:18,157 --> 00:14:21,804
if the magic trick was ever
on the stage, it's in there!

213
00:14:21,804 --> 00:14:22,637
Take it!

214
00:14:24,558 --> 00:14:25,391
- Thanks.

215
00:14:27,048 --> 00:14:27,881
- Sid,

216
00:14:29,689 --> 00:14:31,234
Sid?

217
00:14:31,234 --> 00:14:33,901
- Uh?
- I'm sorry I bothered you.

218
00:14:35,503 --> 00:14:39,186
I still think you're the
greatest magician in the world.

219
00:14:39,186 --> 00:14:40,617
Come on Glenn.

220
00:14:40,617 --> 00:14:42,200
- No wait a second.

221
00:14:43,392 --> 00:14:44,988
(clearing throat)

222
00:14:44,988 --> 00:14:46,962
(tense music)

223
00:14:46,962 --> 00:14:49,462
- Hey look kid I'm sorry, I...

224
00:14:50,593 --> 00:14:53,083
I tell 'ya I had a really bad day today,

225
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:55,034
you know how it goes.

226
00:14:55,034 --> 00:14:56,701
- Yeah, yeah I know.

227
00:14:57,644 --> 00:14:59,706
- Listen, hold on, hold on, let me find

228
00:14:59,706 --> 00:15:02,511
something special for 'ya huh?

229
00:15:02,511 --> 00:15:05,178
You know, every, every magician,

230
00:15:06,423 --> 00:15:08,942
every real magician anyway they,

231
00:15:08,942 --> 00:15:11,279
they know a secret.

232
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:12,893
- What?
- Well you know we all

233
00:15:12,893 --> 00:15:16,855
know that magic is uh, illusion you know?

234
00:15:16,855 --> 00:15:19,122
Just trickery, huh?

235
00:15:19,122 --> 00:15:23,902
But I tell you something, if
you do a trick long enough and,

236
00:15:23,902 --> 00:15:27,571
and hard enough, work at
it, you can feel it inside,

237
00:15:27,571 --> 00:15:31,603
you know in your heart, and
suddenly something happens.

238
00:15:31,603 --> 00:15:34,457
It turns to wonder, you know?

239
00:15:34,457 --> 00:15:37,790
And then you'll discover, a real secret.

240
00:15:39,001 --> 00:15:40,410
Here.

241
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:43,985
Tell you what, I want you to have this.

242
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:46,735
Oh this is, this is, this is old.

243
00:15:48,254 --> 00:15:50,437
In fact it's ancient.

244
00:15:50,437 --> 00:15:52,164
- What is it?

245
00:15:52,164 --> 00:15:56,636
- Well it's a bit that this
here is a, take it it's,

246
00:15:56,636 --> 00:16:00,469
it's the, it's the secret
ring of uh, of uh...

247
00:16:02,039 --> 00:16:03,180
- Astarte.

248
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:05,682
- I was just gonna say that,

249
00:16:05,682 --> 00:16:06,840
Astarte.

250
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:10,129
Now if there was ever a magic in anything,

251
00:16:10,129 --> 00:16:11,776
it's in that ring.

252
00:16:11,776 --> 00:16:15,088
So, you take that home and put it on,

253
00:16:15,088 --> 00:16:18,430
and just see if you don't discover some,

254
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:20,624
some real magic, huh?

255
00:16:20,624 --> 00:16:22,374
- Wow, this is great!

256
00:16:23,996 --> 00:16:25,599
Thanks Mr. Blackmoor.

257
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:27,987
- Ah, don't mention it.

258
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:30,404
From one magician to another.

259
00:16:32,163 --> 00:16:33,707
- Come on Glenn.

260
00:16:33,707 --> 00:16:38,123
- Hey, by the way, whatever
happened to that uh,

261
00:16:38,123 --> 00:16:40,595
ox-cent that you had?
(chuckling)

262
00:16:40,595 --> 00:16:43,815
- It disappeared like magic, wiseguy.

263
00:16:43,815 --> 00:16:44,648
Now scram!

264
00:16:49,524 --> 00:16:53,362
- I always thought that
maybe you had some class.

265
00:16:53,362 --> 00:16:55,612
Mmm-hmm.
- Yeah yeah yeah...

266
00:17:01,116 --> 00:17:05,037
(crickets chirping)
(rumbling)

267
00:17:05,037 --> 00:17:08,120
(suspenseful music)

268
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:17,574
(thunder rumbling)

269
00:17:17,574 --> 00:17:20,241
(hopeful music)

270
00:17:32,837 --> 00:17:35,920
(mystical whistling)

271
00:17:53,471 --> 00:17:56,471
(suspenseful music)

272
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:07,377
(mystical whistling)
(water splashing)

273
00:18:14,944 --> 00:18:17,502
(thunder rumbling)

274
00:18:17,502 --> 00:18:19,252
- It works, it works!

275
00:18:27,959 --> 00:18:29,792
- Hello, Johnny Mysto!

276
00:18:31,352 --> 00:18:33,435
Hey kiddo!
- Oh, it's you!

277
00:18:41,705 --> 00:18:43,038
- What the heck?

278
00:18:44,772 --> 00:18:47,772
(suspenseful music)

279
00:19:07,436 --> 00:19:10,186
(carnival music)

280
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:20,839
- Oh hey Glenn.

281
00:19:20,839 --> 00:19:23,451
Hey, Andrea, that's enough!

282
00:19:23,451 --> 00:19:24,284
- Okay!

283
00:19:25,328 --> 00:19:27,703
- Do you know what time it is?

284
00:19:27,703 --> 00:19:30,703
(mystical jingling)

285
00:19:31,729 --> 00:19:34,229
Oh hey, it's a quarter to one!

286
00:19:35,344 --> 00:19:36,951
Your watch.

287
00:19:36,951 --> 00:19:37,845
- How the heck did you--

288
00:19:37,845 --> 00:19:40,537
- Look, it's ever since last
night, I put the ring on!

289
00:19:40,537 --> 00:19:42,365
It is real magic!

290
00:19:42,365 --> 00:19:44,113
At least close enough for me!

291
00:19:44,113 --> 00:19:46,295
And ever since then they've worked,

292
00:19:46,295 --> 00:19:48,635
all my tricks have worked!

293
00:19:48,635 --> 00:19:52,385
- Wow Johnny, I see very
big things in your--

294
00:19:53,631 --> 00:19:54,631

00:20:19,321 --> 00:20:20,321

Enjoy the show.

307
00:20:29,258 --> 00:20:32,885
Hey, where's your ticket,
admission's a dollar.

308
00:20:32,885 --> 00:20:34,319
- What, for this junk.

309
00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:37,628
- Yeah you know you're right, it is junk.

310
00:20:37,628 --> 00:20:39,012
Don't go.
- I'll put it on

311
00:20:39,012 --> 00:20:40,693
my charge card!

312
00:20:40,693 --> 00:20:43,587
- Look, don't make me get rough.

313
00:20:43,587 --> 00:20:45,463
- Oh, and how you gonna get rough?

314
00:20:45,463 --> 00:20:47,084
(laughing)

315
00:20:47,084 --> 00:20:49,075
- I guess you guys haven't
met Rose yet, have you?

316
00:20:49,075 --> 00:20:50,436
- Who's Rose?

317
00:20:50,436 --> 00:20:54,603
(comically brutish music)
(thudding)

318
00:20:58,706 --> 00:21:00,873
(sighing)

319
00:21:02,392 --> 00:21:04,882
Bringing moms into it, boy that's low!

321
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:08,223

and welcome, thank you!
(applauding)

331
00:21:35,472 --> 00:21:39,274
And now, here we have an
ordinary deck of cards!

332
00:21:39,274 --> 00:21:42,969
- Mysto man you're so
bogus, this is so fake!

333
00:21:42,969 --> 00:21:44,881
- Did I hear someone say fake?

334
00:21:44,881 --> 00:21:47,157
- [Minions] Fake fake fake!

335
00:21:47,157 --> 00:21:48,157
- Assistant!

336
00:21:49,258 --> 00:21:50,091
Assistant!

337
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:54,471
Kindly give me a personal object.

338
00:21:54,471 --> 00:21:56,076
- Huh?
- You're lucky coin.

339
00:21:56,076 --> 00:21:57,493
- Hey!
- Trust me.

340
00:22:02,566 --> 00:22:07,178
And here we have a coin,
solid metal, no tricks.

341
00:22:07,178 --> 00:22:09,178
Now observe, it's metal.

342
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:12,420
Hey Bunko, see the coin?

343
00:22:15,569 --> 00:22:17,879
(fingers snapping)
(magical jingling)

344
00:22:17,879 --> 00:22:19,279
- Hey, my coin?

345
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:20,533
- Andrea!
- Johnny!

346
00:22:20,533 --> 00:22:21,366
- Relax!

347
00:22:22,482 --> 00:22:23,783
- [Bunko] What are you
gonna do now, pull it out

348
00:22:23,783 --> 00:22:26,041
of my ear or something?

349
00:22:26,041 --> 00:22:27,959
- Look in your back pocket.

350
00:22:27,959 --> 00:22:29,331
- Whoa, ha!

351
00:22:29,331 --> 00:22:31,059
Thanks for the dough, Mysto!

352
00:22:31,059 --> 00:22:33,213
- I don't think so.
(magical jingling)

353
00:22:33,213 --> 00:22:34,644
- Where'd it go?

354
00:22:34,644 --> 00:22:38,477
(magical jingling)
What the...

355
00:22:40,527 --> 00:22:43,005
- Oh, by the way Bunko,

356
00:22:43,005 --> 00:22:45,301
(magical jingling)
here's your skivvies!

357
00:22:45,301 --> 00:22:48,301
(children laughing)

358
00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:07,811
- I had a pair of those when I was three!

359
00:23:07,811 --> 00:23:10,228
(applauding)

360
00:23:12,136 --> 00:23:14,469
- And now for my next trick!

361
00:23:16,687 --> 00:23:18,520
Rabbit out of the hat!

362
00:23:20,155 --> 00:23:22,470
And now, rabbit, rabbit,

363
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:26,380
show yourself!
(magical jingling)

364
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:29,498
(dramatic music)
(clapping)

365
00:23:29,498 --> 00:23:31,177
(magical jingling)

366
00:23:31,177 --> 00:23:33,969
(audience giggling)

367
00:23:33,969 --> 00:23:36,636
(comical music)

368
00:23:44,848 --> 00:23:46,950
The trick, it wasn't
supposed to work like that!

369
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:48,815
- Who cares, look at
them, they're loving it!

370
00:23:48,815 --> 00:23:49,815
What's next?

371
00:23:52,208 --> 00:23:54,041
- The cabinet?
- Do it!

372
00:24:02,597 --> 00:24:05,954
And now, the grand finale of today's show!

373
00:24:05,954 --> 00:24:08,584
The disappearing sister!

374
00:24:08,584 --> 00:24:11,692
(applauding)

375
00:24:11,692 --> 00:24:14,821
- As you can see, all four sides open!

376
00:24:14,821 --> 00:24:18,988
No tricks, no secret panels,
and no place to hide.

377
00:24:20,156 --> 00:24:22,989
Now assistant, please step inside.

378
00:24:24,431 --> 00:24:26,901
- Don't close me up!

379
00:24:26,901 --> 00:24:27,734
Please!

380
00:24:33,229 --> 00:24:34,062
- And now,

381
00:24:35,403 --> 00:24:36,820
toomaru, toomara!

382
00:24:38,157 --> 00:24:40,238
- Hey, isn't that from Barney?

383
00:24:40,238 --> 00:24:41,488
- Man, shut up!

384
00:24:42,972 --> 00:24:44,889
- Disappear, disappear!

385
00:24:45,918 --> 00:24:49,097
Disappear, disappear!
(echoing)

386
00:24:49,097 --> 00:24:52,542
(suspenseful music)

387
00:24:52,542 --> 00:24:56,709
(applauding)
(giggling)

388
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:05,711
And now, observe!

389
00:25:06,826 --> 00:25:09,434
(suspenseful music)

390
00:25:09,434 --> 00:25:10,851
Toomaru, toomara!

391
00:25:12,976 --> 00:25:14,393
Toomaru, toomara!

392
00:25:15,704 --> 00:25:17,902
Reappear, reappear,

393
00:25:17,902 --> 00:25:20,819
reappear!
(echoing)

394
00:25:22,747 --> 00:25:25,445
(thunder rumbling)

395
00:25:25,445 --> 00:25:28,445
(suspenseful music)

396
00:25:42,319 --> 00:25:45,540
Well, um, I-I-I-I guess she decided

397
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:49,064
to stay away for a while, so, um,

398
00:25:49,064 --> 00:25:51,602
if you guys want to see her reappear,

399
00:25:51,602 --> 00:25:53,019
you'll have to...

400
00:25:55,241 --> 00:25:57,496
You'll have to come back tomorrow, okay?

401
00:25:57,496 --> 00:25:58,735
- Thank you for coming!

402
00:25:58,735 --> 00:26:00,035
See you tomorrow!

403
00:26:00,035 --> 00:26:02,737
Same time same place same price!

404
00:26:02,737 --> 00:26:05,510
You can keep the rabbits,
thank you very much!

405
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:07,005
Hope you enjoyed the show.

406
00:26:07,005 --> 00:26:10,415
It was perfect, making 'em
come back, that was great!

407
00:26:10,415 --> 00:26:12,028
- Look, i-it wasn't
supposed to work that way!

408
00:26:12,028 --> 00:26:15,138
It wasn't a trick, I mean
it was supposed to be but,

409
00:26:15,138 --> 00:26:17,023
you see there's these mirror
strips right in there,

410
00:26:17,023 --> 00:26:18,164
and if you open them just right,

411
00:26:18,164 --> 00:26:19,780
you can hide her behind them,

412
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:21,661
I mean that's the whole point, see?

413
00:26:21,661 --> 00:26:24,241
The assistant never
actually leaves the cabinet!

414
00:26:24,241 --> 00:26:26,253
But, but, I mean she did it,

415
00:26:26,253 --> 00:26:30,420
s-s-s-she's gone, I mean,
she actually disappeared!

416
00:26:31,684 --> 00:26:35,253
Aw man am I in trouble, come
on I gotta try it again!

417
00:26:35,253 --> 00:26:37,050
- She's probably just in the bathroom,

418
00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:39,028
I mean girls go to!

419
00:26:39,028 --> 00:26:41,498
- Look she didn't just go to the bathroom!

420
00:26:41,498 --> 00:26:45,724
And, I didn't have 10
live rabbits in this hat!

421
00:26:45,724 --> 00:26:47,952
(groans)
It's this ring!

422
00:26:47,952 --> 00:26:49,618
It doesn't just make the tricks work,

423
00:26:49,618 --> 00:26:51,182
it makes real magic!

424
00:26:51,182 --> 00:26:55,349
It made the rabbits appear,
and now Andrea disappear!

425
00:26:56,533 --> 00:26:58,886
And now I can't get it off!

426
00:26:58,886 --> 00:27:00,386
- This is intense!

427
00:27:01,675 --> 00:27:03,603
- Look, it'll be dinner in two hours,

428
00:27:03,603 --> 00:27:04,986
we gotta go to Blackmoor's and maybe

429
00:27:04,986 --> 00:27:06,917
he can get Andrea back, okay?

430
00:27:06,917 --> 00:27:09,061
Come on let's go!

431
00:27:09,061 --> 00:27:11,978
(thunder rumbling)

432
00:27:14,983 --> 00:27:17,697
- Hey Mysto!
(sinister music)

433
00:27:17,697 --> 00:27:19,530
I want to talk to you.

434
00:27:20,884 --> 00:27:22,491
- Look Bunko we're kind of in a hurry!

435
00:27:22,491 --> 00:27:24,857
- I got news for you,
I want that buck back!

436
00:27:24,857 --> 00:27:26,128
- Don't you guys have
anything better to do,

437
00:27:26,128 --> 00:27:28,465
like summer school?

438
00:27:28,465 --> 00:27:30,930
- It seems to me I got a buck coming!

439
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:32,790
- So why don't you just
go take a flying leap!

440
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:36,957
(magical zapping)
(screaming)

441
00:27:39,304 --> 00:27:41,439
(splattering)
(dramatic music)

442
00:27:41,439 --> 00:27:43,439
- Ooh that's gotta hurt!

443
00:27:48,448 --> 00:27:49,281
Don't ask.

444
00:27:55,246 --> 00:27:57,496
(laughing)

445
00:27:58,369 --> 00:28:00,578
- Where's that Mysto?

446
00:28:00,578 --> 00:28:01,441
- Now I can't get it off,

447
00:28:01,441 --> 00:28:03,329
and I can't get Andrea back, and it's,

448
00:28:03,329 --> 00:28:05,985
it's gonna be dinner in around two hours!

449
00:28:05,985 --> 00:28:09,035
- Hey kid, what, we,
we met someplace before

450
00:28:09,035 --> 00:28:10,836
now didn't we?
- Look I was here a

451
00:28:10,836 --> 00:28:11,995
few days ago!

452
00:28:11,995 --> 00:28:13,843
You gave me this ring!

453
00:28:13,843 --> 00:28:17,016
- Oh, yeah yeah yeah, now I remember you!

454
00:28:17,016 --> 00:28:20,104
So, so what do you want, huh?

455
00:28:20,104 --> 00:28:24,186
- I want your help!
- Forget it, he's plastered!

456
00:28:24,186 --> 00:28:26,878
- Look I can't forget
it, he's our only hope!

457
00:28:26,878 --> 00:28:28,393
- He's so sauced!

458
00:28:28,393 --> 00:28:29,987
- Stop, sober up!
(magical jingling)

459
00:28:29,987 --> 00:28:32,965
(dramatic music)
(thumping)

460
00:28:32,965 --> 00:28:33,965
- What the--

461
00:28:35,078 --> 00:28:36,411
What did you do?

462
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,567
Uh, I'm sober!

463
00:28:39,696 --> 00:28:42,401
What a waste of cheap booze!

464
00:28:42,401 --> 00:28:46,383
- Look, it's this ring
you gave me, it's real!

465
00:28:46,383 --> 00:28:47,653
It does real magic!

466
00:28:47,653 --> 00:28:49,410
You want another demonstration?

467
00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:53,311
- No no no no, please, I believe you.

468
00:28:53,311 --> 00:28:55,978
Come here, let me see that ring.

469
00:28:58,098 --> 00:28:59,610
(grunting)

470
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:02,277
- I told you, it won't come off!

471
00:29:03,879 --> 00:29:06,041
- What are you looking for?

472
00:29:06,041 --> 00:29:07,969
- What do you think I'm looking for?

473
00:29:07,969 --> 00:29:09,920
I'm looking for a,

474
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:12,467
the envelope that it came from.

475
00:29:12,467 --> 00:29:13,717
Ah, here it is.

476
00:29:14,729 --> 00:29:15,979
Nothing inside.

477
00:29:16,993 --> 00:29:20,153
But, there is the return address,

478
00:29:20,153 --> 00:29:23,486
Margaret Lattimer, 22nd East 100 Street.

479
00:29:25,544 --> 00:29:29,650
- But, I thought you said
this ring was from Astarte?

480
00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:31,438
You said it had magical powers!

481
00:29:31,438 --> 00:29:33,624
- Hey look kid gimme a break, will 'ya?

482
00:29:33,624 --> 00:29:36,455
I mean I got all sorts of junk here!

483
00:29:36,455 --> 00:29:40,836
You know, all fan mail,
amulets, dried monkey hearts,

484
00:29:40,836 --> 00:29:41,836
you name it!

485
00:29:43,073 --> 00:29:45,814
This was just one of them!

486
00:29:45,814 --> 00:29:47,304
So I thought.

487
00:29:47,304 --> 00:29:49,804
(tense music)

488
00:29:58,754 --> 00:30:01,942
Well, what are you waiting for?

489
00:30:01,942 --> 00:30:05,942
You want help don't you,
let's go see that lady.

490
00:30:07,308 --> 00:30:09,133
And in the future, I'll thank you

491
00:30:09,133 --> 00:30:11,919
not to sober me up against my will.

492
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:12,836
- Whatever.

493
00:30:19,001 --> 00:30:21,168
- Well, this is the place.

494
00:30:23,357 --> 00:30:25,776
What do you think, should we go inside?

495
00:30:25,776 --> 00:30:27,544
- Yeah why not.

496
00:30:27,544 --> 00:30:28,794
- Yeah why not.

497
00:30:31,595 --> 00:30:34,095
(tense music)

498
00:30:36,982 --> 00:30:38,149
Uh, excuse me!

499
00:30:40,407 --> 00:30:43,407
We're looking for Margaret Lattimer?

500
00:30:44,825 --> 00:30:46,542
- What do you want?

501
00:30:46,542 --> 00:30:49,257
- Well, we'd like to
see Margaret Lattimer.

502
00:30:49,257 --> 00:30:51,757
(tense music)

503
00:30:52,726 --> 00:30:57,190
- [Woman] What do you want
Margaret Lattimer for?

504
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:59,454
- Look, lady, if you would just kindly

505
00:30:59,454 --> 00:31:02,254
bring Miss Lattimer out
here I think I can explain.

506
00:31:02,254 --> 00:31:05,212
(chiming)

507
00:31:05,212 --> 00:31:06,984
(mysterious music)
Where'd you get that ring?

508
00:31:06,984 --> 00:31:08,901
- Uh, he gave it to me.

509
00:31:10,276 --> 00:31:12,193
- Who the hell are you?

510
00:31:20,078 --> 00:31:22,495
- I'm Blackmoor the Magician.

511
00:31:23,421 --> 00:31:26,254
- Well I'll be damned, so you are!

512
00:31:28,236 --> 00:31:30,486
You sure have gone to seed.

513
00:31:32,076 --> 00:31:33,641
- Have we met before?

514
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:35,579
- Um, I'll have an order
of fries and a soda.

515
00:31:35,579 --> 00:31:37,286
- Please, we need your help!

516
00:31:37,286 --> 00:31:40,286
I used the ring!
- You used the ring?

517
00:31:41,179 --> 00:31:43,269
You let him use the ring?

518
00:31:43,269 --> 00:31:47,436
- No no no no listen, I I I
didn't exactly do that, you see,

519
00:31:48,308 --> 00:31:51,523
I mean how was I supposed
to know, you know, uh,

520
00:31:51,523 --> 00:31:55,642
I mean why didn't you include
a note or something, eh?

521
00:31:55,642 --> 00:31:59,809
In fact, why did you send
it to me in the first place?

522
00:32:01,308 --> 00:32:04,308
- Eh, this is certainly interesting.

523
00:32:07,058 --> 00:32:10,945
Not how I thought things would turn out.

524
00:32:10,945 --> 00:32:13,993
- Look, the ring, it
made my sister disappear!

525
00:32:13,993 --> 00:32:18,097
- Well I'm not surprised,
that ring is ancient.

526
00:32:18,097 --> 00:32:19,680
It's full of power.

527
00:32:21,337 --> 00:32:25,045
It's been in my family for 1200 years,

528
00:32:25,045 --> 00:32:28,784
passed on from mother to daughter...

529
00:32:28,784 --> 00:32:32,217
- So, what are we're gonna do about it?

530
00:32:32,217 --> 00:32:34,899
- Well that's not the point, is it?

531
00:32:34,899 --> 00:32:36,989
- Isn't it?
- Ah...

532
00:32:36,989 --> 00:32:40,359
We don't possess the ring anymore!

533
00:32:40,359 --> 00:32:41,442
The boy does!

534
00:32:43,276 --> 00:32:45,429
- Look, I'm sorry I messed
around with the ring!

535
00:32:45,429 --> 00:32:47,277
If I'd known I wouldn't have put it on!

536
00:32:47,277 --> 00:32:48,973
(poignant music)
All I want to do is get

537
00:32:48,973 --> 00:32:51,381
this off and get my sister back!

538
00:32:51,381 --> 00:32:54,240
I admit it's my fault, and I'm sorry!

539
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:58,407
I just want to know if she's
okay, if she's not hurt!

540
00:32:59,786 --> 00:33:01,036
- Come with me.

541
00:33:02,457 --> 00:33:05,124
(ominous music)

542
00:33:15,043 --> 00:33:18,031
(door clattering)

543
00:33:18,031 --> 00:33:19,281
- [Glenn] Cool!

544
00:33:20,814 --> 00:33:22,397
- Careful, careful!

545
00:33:26,169 --> 00:33:27,002
Careful.

546
00:33:29,105 --> 00:33:30,355
There we are...

547
00:33:33,972 --> 00:33:36,968
(clicking)
(tense music)

548
00:33:36,968 --> 00:33:40,575
I'm sorry to say, there is no power

549
00:33:40,575 --> 00:33:44,810
on earth today, who
can restore your sister

550
00:33:44,810 --> 00:33:47,045
or remove that ring.

551
00:33:47,045 --> 00:33:50,664
Its ways have been lost,
forgotten maybe for 1000 years,

552
00:33:50,664 --> 00:33:54,710
but there is one hope,
and it's a slim one.

553
00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:56,793
- I'll do whatever I have to.

554
00:33:56,793 --> 00:34:00,826
- The only way you can rescue your sister,

555
00:34:00,826 --> 00:34:04,159
is to find the first master of the ring.

556
00:34:05,559 --> 00:34:07,002
- Who's that?

557
00:34:07,002 --> 00:34:09,533
- The great wizard Merlin!

558
00:34:09,533 --> 00:34:11,646
- (laughs) Oh, please!

559
00:34:11,646 --> 00:34:13,983
- Is Merlin still around?

560
00:34:13,983 --> 00:34:16,055
- Of course not!

561
00:34:16,055 --> 00:34:18,722
You have to travel back in time!

562
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,343
- Uh, back in time?

563
00:34:22,354 --> 00:34:26,202
- See the ring carries a destiny with it.

564
00:34:26,202 --> 00:34:29,869
And a prophecy that
someday a hero will come

565
00:34:31,769 --> 00:34:34,077
and will claim the ring,

566
00:34:34,077 --> 00:34:37,510
and bring it back to its master.

567
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:41,677
That path still exists, it's
right here in this room!

568
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:46,886
But, throughout all time,
throughout all space,

569
00:34:46,886 --> 00:34:51,355
there is only one person
who can find the way!

570
00:34:51,355 --> 00:34:54,313
- What if it isn't his destiny?

571
00:34:54,313 --> 00:34:58,063
- Well, that wouldn't
be good news, would it?

572
00:34:59,523 --> 00:35:03,760
I like to think of what my
grandmother used to say.

573
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:07,843
Trust in tomorrow, for if
it hasn't happened yet,

574
00:35:08,727 --> 00:35:09,727
it just may!

575
00:35:10,831 --> 00:35:12,365
(tense music)

576
00:35:12,365 --> 00:35:13,452
(laughing)

577
00:35:13,452 --> 00:35:15,098
- Swell.

578
00:35:15,098 --> 00:35:17,269
Guess that's supposed to be comforting.

579
00:35:17,269 --> 00:35:19,602
- Now, where the heck is it?

580
00:35:23,315 --> 00:35:27,314
- [Blackmoor] What you looking
for, the Addams family?

581
00:35:27,314 --> 00:35:30,666
- I always meant to
clean up this place but,

582
00:35:30,666 --> 00:35:31,814
but then i thought why,

583
00:35:31,814 --> 00:35:33,885
(magical chiming)
it'll just get messier.

584
00:35:33,885 --> 00:35:38,581
Uh, the messier it gets,
the easier it is to just,

585
00:35:38,581 --> 00:35:39,414
let it be.

586
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:43,913
(magical chiming)

587
00:35:48,159 --> 00:35:51,159
(suspenseful music)

588
00:35:59,807 --> 00:36:00,681
(thumping)

589
00:36:00,681 --> 00:36:02,115
(grunting)

590
00:36:02,115 --> 00:36:03,982
- What's going on here?

591
00:36:03,982 --> 00:36:04,899
- Hey, hey!

592
00:36:07,939 --> 00:36:09,544
H-Help!
- Stop fighting!

593
00:36:09,544 --> 00:36:10,866
(mumbling)
Stop--

594
00:36:10,866 --> 00:36:12,116
- Oh of course!

595
00:36:14,051 --> 00:36:15,634
M for magic scroll!

596
00:36:23,992 --> 00:36:26,992
(suspenseful music)

597
00:36:39,399 --> 00:36:41,036
- Whose hand print is it?

598
00:36:41,036 --> 00:36:44,211
- Some say that it's old Merlin's himself.

599
00:36:44,211 --> 00:36:47,711
No one knows for sure, but that's the way.

600
00:36:48,675 --> 00:36:52,750
Now, if you're the chosen
one, your hand on that mark

601
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:55,948
will draw you back into ancient times!

602
00:36:55,948 --> 00:37:00,064
- Wait a second, what
about my sister Andrea?

603
00:37:00,064 --> 00:37:01,007
- What about her?

604
00:37:01,007 --> 00:37:03,394
- Look, you can cover for
me, that's no problem,

605
00:37:03,394 --> 00:37:05,010
I mean you can just like
write a note or something,

606
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:06,635
put my name on it.

607
00:37:06,635 --> 00:37:09,398
But if Andrea doesn't
come back for dinner,

608
00:37:09,398 --> 00:37:11,146
Rose is gonna go ape!

609
00:37:11,146 --> 00:37:13,189
And if she can't find her,
she'll call the police

610
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:17,018
and the fire department,
and even my parents!

611
00:37:17,018 --> 00:37:20,117
- Do you have a personal
object of your sister's?

612
00:37:20,117 --> 00:37:21,598
- No I don't think--

613
00:37:21,598 --> 00:37:25,142
Wait a second, yeah, yeah,
I got her lucky coin.

614
00:37:25,142 --> 00:37:26,071
- Uh-hmm!

615
00:37:26,071 --> 00:37:27,014
- Ah, what do you want me to do with it?

616
00:37:27,014 --> 00:37:28,431
- Give it to him.

617
00:37:29,601 --> 00:37:32,460
- Now what?
- Now, he can use the

618
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:36,489
power of the ring to change
you into the likeness

619
00:37:36,489 --> 00:37:38,698
of his sister, you can take her place

620
00:37:38,698 --> 00:37:40,472
until the real one is found.

621
00:37:40,472 --> 00:37:42,460
- I can do what, no!
- That'd be perfect!

622
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:44,443
Look, you spend most of your
time over at my house anyway!

623
00:37:44,443 --> 00:37:45,610
- Yeah I know but--
- And your parents will

624
00:37:45,610 --> 00:37:46,971
never know your gone a night!

625
00:37:46,971 --> 00:37:48,087
- Hey now, come on, that--

626
00:37:48,087 --> 00:37:49,490
- And I won't be gone very long,

627
00:37:49,490 --> 00:37:51,522
it'll just be a day, maybe a couple days!

628
00:37:51,522 --> 00:37:52,590
- Couple of days?

629
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:54,082
- I promise you I'll be back before

630
00:37:54,082 --> 00:37:55,850
my parents get back from the Grand Canyon!

631
00:37:55,850 --> 00:37:57,841
- The Grand Canyon!
- Look, please promise

632
00:37:57,841 --> 00:37:59,701
you'll do this for me, I'm desperate!

633
00:37:59,701 --> 00:38:01,684
- Promise, no I--
- Thank you!

634
00:38:01,684 --> 00:38:02,732
Now what do you want me to do?

635
00:38:02,732 --> 00:38:05,152
- Point at him, and bid him change

636
00:38:05,152 --> 00:38:07,854
into the form of your sister!

637
00:38:07,854 --> 00:38:11,166
- No no come on guys, I
did not promise anything!

638
00:38:11,166 --> 00:38:14,933
- Glenn, I bid you change
into the form of my sister!

639
00:38:14,933 --> 00:38:16,265
- Now come on, can't we just give this

640
00:38:16,265 --> 00:38:18,744
a little thought, maybe
we can just pretend

641
00:38:18,744 --> 00:38:21,474
Andrea's been, I don't know,
hit by a car or something?

642
00:38:21,474 --> 00:38:22,569
Or maybe kidnapped?

643
00:38:22,569 --> 00:38:23,896
- Did you see that?

644
00:38:23,896 --> 00:38:25,774
Did you see that?

645
00:38:25,774 --> 00:38:29,329
Oh, imagine that act in Las Vegas, huh?

646
00:38:29,329 --> 00:38:31,239
And I just gave it away!

647
00:38:31,239 --> 00:38:33,982
- Something's wrong, something's missing!

648
00:38:33,982 --> 00:38:35,446
Why am I suddenly so short,

649
00:38:35,446 --> 00:38:37,324
and why am I dressed like ballerina?

650
00:38:37,324 --> 00:38:40,046
Johnny!
- I will never ever ever

651
00:38:40,046 --> 00:38:41,930
be able to repay you for this!

652
00:38:41,930 --> 00:38:44,263
You better hurry, you
wouldn't want to miss dinner.

653
00:38:44,263 --> 00:38:45,807
- Did you say dinner?
- Yep, and they're having

654
00:38:45,807 --> 00:38:47,198
spaghetti and meatballs tonight.

655
00:38:47,198 --> 00:38:49,544
- Yeah you're right, okay I'll go.

656
00:38:49,544 --> 00:38:52,357
- Here, take these, they're
from my private stock.

657
00:38:52,357 --> 00:38:53,857
You may need them.

658
00:38:56,007 --> 00:38:58,435
- You be careful on the stairs!

659
00:38:58,435 --> 00:39:00,102
- [Glen] Thanks, ow!

660
00:39:00,102 --> 00:39:04,123
- Now, are you ready to try your destiny?

661
00:39:04,123 --> 00:39:06,798
- I'm with 'ya all the way kid!

662
00:39:06,798 --> 00:39:09,798
(suspenseful music)

663
00:39:24,838 --> 00:39:29,005
(mystical whooshing)
(mystical rumbling)

664
00:39:37,062 --> 00:39:40,145
(thunderous booming)

665
00:39:43,284 --> 00:39:46,368
(magical whooshing)

666
00:39:46,368 --> 00:39:49,535
(explosion crackling)

667
00:39:50,613 --> 00:39:52,891
- [Margaret] Godspeed young hero!

668
00:39:52,891 --> 00:39:57,058
(echoing)
(crickets chirping)

669
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:02,120
(owl hooting)

670
00:40:05,327 --> 00:40:07,631
(magical humming)

671
00:40:07,631 --> 00:40:09,459
(mystical bubbling)

672
00:40:09,459 --> 00:40:14,042
(mystical whooshing)
(electric crackling)

673
00:40:14,042 --> 00:40:16,959
(mystical humming)

674
00:40:19,438 --> 00:40:22,438
(crickets chirping)

675
00:40:25,293 --> 00:40:28,793
(mystical energy humming)

676
00:40:49,842 --> 00:40:51,284
- Hey Mr. Blackmoor!

677
00:40:51,284 --> 00:40:52,442
Hey!

678
00:40:52,442 --> 00:40:56,102
- (groans) Oh, oh...

679
00:40:56,102 --> 00:40:58,352
(grunting)

680
00:40:59,369 --> 00:41:00,954
- I guess you meant it when you said,

681
00:41:00,954 --> 00:41:02,427
be with me all the way, huh?

682
00:41:02,427 --> 00:41:03,844
- I did?
- Thanks.

683
00:41:05,193 --> 00:41:06,859
I can use all the help I can get.

684
00:41:06,859 --> 00:41:07,692
- Help?

685
00:41:08,808 --> 00:41:09,641
Help!

686
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:13,283
- Whoa, look!

687
00:41:14,742 --> 00:41:15,575
Come on!

688
00:41:17,208 --> 00:41:20,167
- (chuckles) Oh my god!

689
00:41:20,167 --> 00:41:22,667
(tense music)

690
00:41:32,154 --> 00:41:35,404
(vigorous regal music)

691
00:41:48,771 --> 00:41:50,916
- Do you think Merlin's in there?

692
00:41:50,916 --> 00:41:53,333
- Oh sure, how should I know?

693
00:42:02,262 --> 00:42:04,236
Oh boy I hope this guy's friendly.

694
00:42:04,236 --> 00:42:07,202
- (chuckles) What have we here?

695
00:42:07,202 --> 00:42:10,616
Two plump pheasants for
a cooking pot (chuckles)!

696
00:42:10,616 --> 00:42:11,449
Get them!

697
00:42:12,424 --> 00:42:13,553
Hi-yah!
(horse whinnying)

698
00:42:13,553 --> 00:42:15,088
(dramatic music)
- This way!

699
00:42:15,088 --> 00:42:16,449
- [Soldier] Let's go!

700
00:42:16,449 --> 00:42:18,699
(shouting)

701
00:42:23,335 --> 00:42:24,835
- This way, quick!

702
00:42:26,294 --> 00:42:30,127
- This way!
(hooves pounding)

703
00:42:32,139 --> 00:42:35,222
- [Soldier] We can't let them escape!

704
00:42:42,232 --> 00:42:43,982
- [Soldier] This way!

705
00:42:56,358 --> 00:42:58,044
- What do we do now?

706
00:42:58,044 --> 00:42:59,855
- Look they're coming from over there too!

707
00:42:59,855 --> 00:43:01,907
(horse whinnying)

708
00:43:01,907 --> 00:43:03,228
- [Soldier] Spread out some more!

709
00:43:03,228 --> 00:43:06,284
- Follow me!
- Come on, let's go this way!

710
00:43:06,284 --> 00:43:08,857
(perilous music)

711
00:43:08,857 --> 00:43:12,524
- [Soldier] Hey hold
it, get down there too!

712
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:14,907
- They're trying to cut us off!

713
00:43:14,907 --> 00:43:16,482
- [Blackmoor] Trying to?

714
00:43:16,482 --> 00:43:17,798
They are cutting us off!

715
00:43:17,798 --> 00:43:19,462
- Here let's go up!

716
00:43:19,462 --> 00:43:21,795
- Up where?
- Up in the tree!

717
00:43:22,815 --> 00:43:25,711
- Ah come on kid, gimme a break will you!

718
00:43:25,711 --> 00:43:27,049
I haven't been up a tree in years!

719
00:43:27,049 --> 00:43:29,283
- Come on!
- Let's go around here!

720
00:43:29,283 --> 00:43:30,859
- [Soldier] Let's lead the horses around!

721
00:43:30,859 --> 00:43:33,569
(guards shouting)

722
00:43:33,569 --> 00:43:36,437
(sinister music)
(horse whinnying)

723
00:43:36,437 --> 00:43:39,270
(hooves pounding)

724
00:43:41,670 --> 00:43:43,443
- [Soldier] Go that way!

725
00:43:43,443 --> 00:43:45,443
Don't let them get away!

726
00:43:57,964 --> 00:44:00,513
- [Soldier] Spread out!

727
00:44:00,513 --> 00:44:02,222
Watch the road (mumbles)!

728
00:44:02,222 --> 00:44:03,516
(mumbling)

729
00:44:03,516 --> 00:44:07,004
(soldiers shouting)

730
00:44:07,004 --> 00:44:10,185
(cracking)
- Oh, ah!

731
00:44:10,185 --> 00:44:12,708
(grunting)

732
00:44:12,708 --> 00:44:16,875
- Come on, come on, come on!
(Blackmoor grunting)

733
00:44:21,990 --> 00:44:24,692
(whooshing)

734
00:44:24,692 --> 00:44:25,525
- Andrea!

735
00:44:26,805 --> 00:44:27,638
Andrea!

736
00:44:34,632 --> 00:44:38,183
Ah, there you are little cupcake!

737
00:44:38,183 --> 00:44:39,849
Nyum nyum nyum!

738
00:44:39,849 --> 00:44:42,682
Do you know where your brother is?

739
00:44:49,161 --> 00:44:51,161
Camping with Glenn, hmm.

740
00:44:52,942 --> 00:44:55,055
Well Andrea, can you picture this

741
00:44:55,055 --> 00:44:57,668
rolly-polly Glenn in a sleeping bag

742
00:44:57,668 --> 00:45:01,249
like a little stuffed sausage, hmm?

743
00:45:01,249 --> 00:45:03,905
But he should have told me before.

744
00:45:03,905 --> 00:45:06,941
I made enough spaghetti for four!

745
00:45:06,941 --> 00:45:08,578
- That's okay I'll eat it!

746
00:45:08,578 --> 00:45:09,898
- Andrea!

747
00:45:09,898 --> 00:45:10,912
(gasping)

748
00:45:10,912 --> 00:45:13,535
What happened to your voice?

749
00:45:13,535 --> 00:45:14,824
(coughing)

750
00:45:14,824 --> 00:45:17,380
- My voice, uh, I'm just a bit hoarse.

751
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:18,213
- Hoarse?

752
00:45:18,213 --> 00:45:19,865
Do you have a temperature?

753
00:45:19,865 --> 00:45:21,598
- No, me and the guys, I mean,

754
00:45:21,598 --> 00:45:23,853
me and the girls were
having a screaming contest.

755
00:45:23,853 --> 00:45:25,600
- Oh silly thing!

756
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:28,294
You make yourself sound like a frog!

757
00:45:28,294 --> 00:45:30,461
Come, it's dinner--
- Okay!

758
00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:33,493
- Time?

759
00:45:34,336 --> 00:45:37,003
(comical music)

760
00:45:39,642 --> 00:45:42,392
- Don't worry, everything's fine.

761
00:45:44,123 --> 00:45:46,456
(whooshing)

762
00:45:49,164 --> 00:45:51,914
(dramatic music)

763
00:45:54,399 --> 00:45:55,466
(horse whinnying)

764
00:45:55,466 --> 00:45:57,049
- [Johnny] Come on!

765
00:46:01,839 --> 00:46:02,672
Come on!

766
00:46:04,350 --> 00:46:06,017
- [Soldier] Come on!

767
00:46:09,628 --> 00:46:13,562
- [Soldier] (mumbles) to the castle!

768
00:46:13,562 --> 00:46:16,145
- [Soldier] I'm ready let's go.

769
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:32,303
- Okay?
- I'm okay, believe it or not,

770
00:46:33,765 --> 00:46:37,115
I used to do a balancing act on chairs.

771
00:46:37,115 --> 00:46:39,248
Of course that was back
when they called me

772
00:46:39,248 --> 00:46:40,873
The Great Ricardo.

773
00:46:40,873 --> 00:46:42,490
- Your name isn't really Blackmoor?

774
00:46:42,490 --> 00:46:43,941
- Nah.

775
00:46:43,941 --> 00:46:45,108
Sid Berkowitz.

776
00:46:46,193 --> 00:46:48,387
Let me tell you something
about magic, kid.

777
00:46:48,387 --> 00:46:49,928
You don't just stand there doing tricks,

778
00:46:49,928 --> 00:46:53,638
you gotta, you gotta
invent a new personality,

779
00:46:53,638 --> 00:46:57,722
a stage person you
know, a whole other you!

780
00:46:57,722 --> 00:47:01,389
Then after a while, a
strange thing happens.

781
00:47:02,373 --> 00:47:06,531
People get sick of you,
you're no longer hip.

782
00:47:06,531 --> 00:47:09,971
Then you realize that,
what people are looking at

783
00:47:09,971 --> 00:47:13,638
on the stage, this you
that you've invented,

784
00:47:17,592 --> 00:47:19,128
he's all you got left.

785
00:47:19,128 --> 00:47:20,657
- I don't believe that.

786
00:47:20,657 --> 00:47:24,195
You've got the magic,
you do the impossible.

787
00:47:24,195 --> 00:47:27,446
- I'm just a trickster, just a sort of,

788
00:47:27,446 --> 00:47:29,449
con man of the supernatural.

789
00:47:29,449 --> 00:47:33,124
- No, y-you get on stage,
and people watch you,

790
00:47:33,124 --> 00:47:35,541
and they think, I don't know,

791
00:47:36,579 --> 00:47:38,397
they think that anything can happen.

792
00:47:38,397 --> 00:47:40,023
I believe that.

793
00:47:40,023 --> 00:47:42,919
- Yeah but you're not me kid.

794
00:47:42,919 --> 00:47:46,942
Now what do you say we
get down out of here huh?

795
00:47:46,942 --> 00:47:48,775
My back is killing me.

796
00:48:03,217 --> 00:48:04,740
Let me see, I'm a little
turned around here,

797
00:48:04,740 --> 00:48:07,057
now I know the soldiers went that way,

798
00:48:07,057 --> 00:48:10,270
and I think that the
castle is back that way,

799
00:48:10,270 --> 00:48:12,937
so I say let's go that way, huh?

800
00:48:17,660 --> 00:48:20,577
(magical jingling)

801
00:48:30,036 --> 00:48:32,369
Don't get stuck to anything!

802
00:48:38,707 --> 00:48:42,874
(birds chirping)
(pleasant music)

803
00:48:53,414 --> 00:48:54,836
- Come on we got to find Merlin.

804
00:48:54,836 --> 00:48:59,220
- No problem, just find me a
phone book here huh (chuckles).

805
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:02,443
- Hey uh, excuse me,
we were wondering if--

806
00:49:02,443 --> 00:49:04,360
- Eh, you be strangers?

807
00:49:06,254 --> 00:49:07,087
- Yeah.

808
00:49:08,063 --> 00:49:08,896
- Go, go!

809
00:49:13,231 --> 00:49:14,064
- Okay.

810
00:49:17,023 --> 00:49:19,855
- What, what was his problem?

811
00:49:19,855 --> 00:49:21,272
- I have no idea.

812
00:49:24,457 --> 00:49:26,957
(tense music)

813
00:49:48,436 --> 00:49:50,979
- Who be you, strangers?

814
00:49:50,979 --> 00:49:54,223
- I be Johnny Mysto, and this be--

815
00:49:54,223 --> 00:49:56,153
- I'm Sydney Blackmoor.

816
00:49:56,153 --> 00:49:58,320
- I can see by your dress,

817
00:49:59,181 --> 00:50:01,681
you are not born to this land.

818
00:50:02,784 --> 00:50:04,951
But, if you come in peace,

819
00:50:07,213 --> 00:50:08,463
you're welcome.

820
00:50:10,809 --> 00:50:15,537
I feel though, we have
little enough to offer you.

821
00:50:15,537 --> 00:50:17,704
Once this was a fine land.

822
00:50:19,853 --> 00:50:22,020
No longer, as you can see.

823
00:50:23,428 --> 00:50:24,928
It has grown sick.

824
00:50:26,752 --> 00:50:30,335
I fear that the dead,
outnumber the living.

825
00:50:33,079 --> 00:50:34,378
- Excuse me can I ask you a question?

826
00:50:34,378 --> 00:50:37,961
Uh, I notice this really
strong smell here.

827
00:50:39,424 --> 00:50:42,666
Haven't you people ever
heard of sanitation?

828
00:50:42,666 --> 00:50:44,749
- We be simple folk here.

829
00:50:45,703 --> 00:50:48,870
We know nothing of such distant lands.

830
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:53,539
We are plagued here stranger.

831
00:50:53,539 --> 00:50:57,539
The black sickness, little
food, and less trust.

832
00:51:00,336 --> 00:51:02,919
But, so long as I am the elder,

833
00:51:05,009 --> 00:51:06,926
what we have, we share.

834
00:51:09,353 --> 00:51:10,747
- Hey wait a second.

835
00:51:10,747 --> 00:51:14,701
We have something to
share with you too, here.

836
00:51:14,701 --> 00:51:16,290
Here, here, it's a gift.

837
00:51:16,290 --> 00:51:18,440
It's, it's food.

838
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:19,857
Yeah, you eat it.

839
00:51:21,225 --> 00:51:24,920
No wait wait wait wait,
you have to open it,

840
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:26,731
just like that.

841
00:51:26,731 --> 00:51:29,055
There we go, there we go.

842
00:51:29,055 --> 00:51:33,383
It, it's good, it's, it's umm, umm, yummy!

843
00:51:33,383 --> 00:51:34,216
- Mmm.

844
00:51:35,537 --> 00:51:38,120
Tis true, it has a sweet savor.

845
00:51:40,068 --> 00:51:42,851
- Yeah, and almonds too.

846
00:51:42,851 --> 00:51:44,973
- I think you just invented tooth decay.

847
00:51:44,973 --> 00:51:47,159
(chuckling)

848
00:51:47,159 --> 00:51:50,228
Maybe not.
- Soldiers, soldiers!

849
00:51:50,228 --> 00:51:51,428
The soldiers are coming!

850
00:51:51,428 --> 00:51:52,768
(dramatic music)
The soldiers are coming,

851
00:51:52,768 --> 00:51:55,089
soldiers!
(shouting)

852
00:51:55,089 --> 00:51:56,422
- Run, everyone!

853
00:51:58,015 --> 00:51:58,848
Run, run!

854
00:52:01,001 --> 00:52:02,902
- [Sprout] This way
strangers, if you would live!

855
00:52:02,902 --> 00:52:06,569
(dramatic music)
- I would!

856
00:52:12,583 --> 00:52:13,612
- Hurry, flip the table!

857
00:52:13,612 --> 00:52:15,029
Hurry now, hurry!

858
00:52:29,517 --> 00:52:31,267
Quick, inside, hurry!

859
00:52:35,870 --> 00:52:36,703
Quickly!

860
00:52:38,129 --> 00:52:41,129
(soldiers shouting)

861
00:52:54,443 --> 00:52:56,678
- Why are they searching for us?

862
00:52:56,678 --> 00:52:59,429
- Lord Malfeasor has to
account for any stranger!

863
00:52:59,429 --> 00:53:03,617
(mumbles), no man, no maid, no wee child.

864
00:53:03,617 --> 00:53:06,389
The soldiers come out,
and gather the people.

865
00:53:06,389 --> 00:53:09,233
The captives go in, but
they do not come out again.

866
00:53:09,233 --> 00:53:10,966
None save Lord Malfeasor himself and

867
00:53:10,966 --> 00:53:14,333
the rogues that take
his pay know their fate!

868
00:53:14,333 --> 00:53:16,202
- Who's this Lord Malfeasor?

869
00:53:16,202 --> 00:53:19,911
(soldiers shouting)
(horse whinnying)

870
00:53:19,911 --> 00:53:21,780
- Where have you come from boy?

871
00:53:21,780 --> 00:53:24,735
Malfeasor was a knight, a powerful knight,

872
00:53:24,735 --> 00:53:26,840
and now he's called the Usurper.

873
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:29,195
For four long seasons now he has ruled,

874
00:53:29,195 --> 00:53:31,327
and made the land sick by a black trick!

875
00:53:31,327 --> 00:53:32,915
He has imprisoned the king and queen in

876
00:53:32,915 --> 00:53:34,296
the dungeon of Camelot!

877
00:53:34,296 --> 00:53:35,820
- Camelot?

878
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:37,465
The real Camelot?

879
00:53:37,465 --> 00:53:40,786
The king and queen, Arthur and Guinevere?

880
00:53:40,786 --> 00:53:43,509
- What of them?
- If this guy's so evil,

881
00:53:43,509 --> 00:53:45,355
why would he bother keeping them prisoner,

882
00:53:45,355 --> 00:53:48,335
I mean, why not just like,
like, chop of their heads,

883
00:53:48,335 --> 00:53:49,438
or like, do something like that?

884
00:53:49,438 --> 00:53:52,152
- So long as Arthur lives,
those who are still true

885
00:53:52,152 --> 00:53:54,431
will seek to free him,
and Malfeasor gathers

886
00:53:54,431 --> 00:53:56,726
those loyal men up as they come.

887
00:53:56,726 --> 00:53:59,173
However brave, they cannot stand against

888
00:53:59,173 --> 00:54:01,753
the power of the ring!

889
00:54:01,753 --> 00:54:05,776
- Listen, we need to find
a wizard named Merlin.

890
00:54:05,776 --> 00:54:07,007
- Do yee now?

891
00:54:07,007 --> 00:54:08,980
Many's the man who'd like to find Merlin.

892
00:54:08,980 --> 00:54:12,626
- But without Merlin, I
can't get my sister back!

893
00:54:12,626 --> 00:54:14,486
And I-I don't know what I'll do!

894
00:54:14,486 --> 00:54:15,389
- Shh!

895
00:54:15,389 --> 00:54:17,889
(tense music)

896
00:54:19,684 --> 00:54:20,517
Hush.

897
00:54:46,342 --> 00:54:48,751
- Well well well!
(laughing)

898
00:54:48,751 --> 00:54:51,168
Here are our plumb pheasants,

899
00:54:52,184 --> 00:54:56,351
and a tiny little squab
to go with them (laughes)!

900
00:54:58,413 --> 00:55:00,364
- Did your brother tell you anything

901
00:55:00,364 --> 00:55:02,864
about going on this trip, hmm?

902
00:55:04,373 --> 00:55:05,373
- Like what?

903
00:55:07,587 --> 00:55:11,894
- Where he was going,
when he would be back.

904
00:55:11,894 --> 00:55:16,192
It was not good, he shouldn't
go off without asking.

905
00:55:16,192 --> 00:55:18,025
And he has not called.

906
00:55:19,147 --> 00:55:21,577
I think I'll call Glenn's parents.

907
00:55:21,577 --> 00:55:22,612
- No!

908
00:55:22,612 --> 00:55:23,922
- Why not?

909
00:55:23,922 --> 00:55:25,255
- Well they're not home,

910
00:55:25,255 --> 00:55:27,336
they're camping with
Glenn and Johnny, right?

911
00:55:27,336 --> 00:55:30,538
- Perhaps they've come home,
I'll call and find out.

912
00:55:30,538 --> 00:55:34,038
(comically ominous music)

913
00:55:38,267 --> 00:55:40,600
Now, where is that number...

914
00:55:48,316 --> 00:55:49,149
- Got it!

915
00:56:02,172 --> 00:56:04,915
(telephone ringing)

916
00:56:04,915 --> 00:56:07,596
- Mysto residence, this is Rose.

917
00:56:07,596 --> 00:56:09,637
- [Glenn] Hi Rose this is Glenn.

918
00:56:09,637 --> 00:56:13,689
- Glenn, I was getting
worried, where are you?

919
00:56:13,689 --> 00:56:16,577
- Uh, my parents took me and
Johnny down to Lake Cashamont.

920
00:56:16,577 --> 00:56:18,071
Didn't Johnny leave you a note?

921
00:56:18,071 --> 00:56:21,250
- Yes yes but he did not say where he was,

922
00:56:21,250 --> 00:56:23,369
or when he would be back.

923
00:56:23,369 --> 00:56:26,035
Is he there, let me talk to him.

924
00:56:26,035 --> 00:56:29,034
- Um, well sorry, the phone is around

925
00:56:29,034 --> 00:56:33,654
half a mile from the lake,
they're, they're at the lake.

926
00:56:33,654 --> 00:56:37,169
- Oh, well, and you walk a half mile

927
00:56:37,169 --> 00:56:39,253
to call me on the phone.

928
00:56:39,253 --> 00:56:41,279
- Actually the phone is
at the general store,

929
00:56:41,279 --> 00:56:43,363
I was kind of hungry.

930
00:56:43,363 --> 00:56:45,891
- Oh, I see, all right.
- Yes.

931
00:56:45,891 --> 00:56:47,395
- When are you going home?

932
00:56:47,395 --> 00:56:49,303
- When are Johnny's parent's coming home?

933
00:56:49,303 --> 00:56:50,718
- [Rose] Tomorrow afternoon.

934
00:56:50,718 --> 00:56:52,614
- Well, we'll be home by then.

935
00:56:52,614 --> 00:56:54,630
- All right, but you tell Johnny

936
00:56:54,630 --> 00:56:57,751
he should not go away
without asking first.

937
00:56:57,751 --> 00:56:59,620
- Okay, I'll tell him, bye.

938
00:56:59,620 --> 00:57:00,453
- Bye.

939
00:57:01,692 --> 00:57:02,525
- Yes!

940
00:57:04,688 --> 00:57:07,039
(sighing)

941
00:57:07,039 --> 00:57:09,706
(doorbell ringing)

942
00:57:09,706 --> 00:57:11,456
- [Rose] Andrea?

943
00:57:11,456 --> 00:57:12,455
- Yeah?

944
00:57:12,455 --> 00:57:14,068
- [Rose] Come down here!

945
00:57:14,068 --> 00:57:15,795
- Yeah Rose?

946
00:57:15,795 --> 00:57:19,505
- Andrea, your little
friends have come to play!

947
00:57:19,505 --> 00:57:21,191
- Hey Andrea, I brought over my doll!

948
00:57:21,191 --> 00:57:22,911
- [Girl] I brought my makeup one!

949
00:57:22,911 --> 00:57:25,994
- [Girl] I brought some doll clothes!

950
00:57:32,493 --> 00:57:36,278
- Oh man, what could be worse than this!

951
00:57:36,278 --> 00:57:40,132
(dramatic music)
- Hey, take it easy will you?

952
00:57:40,132 --> 00:57:42,091
Just chill out, will 'ya?

953
00:57:42,091 --> 00:57:43,708
- You don't know who you're dealing with!

954
00:57:43,708 --> 00:57:46,500
- And who is that?
- I am Blackmoor,

955
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:47,833
Master of Magic!

956
00:57:48,828 --> 00:57:52,411
Observe!
(magical jingling)

957
00:57:55,693 --> 00:57:56,569
(popping)

958
00:57:56,569 --> 00:57:59,332
(laughing)

959
00:57:59,332 --> 00:58:01,221
- That be fine kitchen magic.

960
00:58:01,221 --> 00:58:04,911
What else can you do, Master (laughs)?

961
00:58:04,911 --> 00:58:07,024
- Look, if you guys don't get out of here

962
00:58:07,024 --> 00:58:09,459
and leave us alone,
you'll be in big trouble!

963
00:58:09,459 --> 00:58:10,884
(laughing)

964
00:58:10,884 --> 00:58:12,664
- Oh, trouble!

965
00:58:12,664 --> 00:58:17,528
- The boy's a magical
master too (chuckles)!

966
00:58:17,528 --> 00:58:19,139
Take 'em, kill the girl!

967
00:58:19,139 --> 00:58:21,389
(tense music)
- Don't make me do it!

968
00:58:21,389 --> 00:58:22,639
Look I mean it!

969
00:58:24,733 --> 00:58:28,400
Get lost!
(magical jingling)

970
00:58:30,676 --> 00:58:32,679
- They have disappeared!
- What happened?

971
00:58:32,679 --> 00:58:34,831
- Quickly, (mumbles).
- Where are they?

972
00:58:34,831 --> 00:58:38,149
(soldiers shouting)

973
00:58:38,149 --> 00:58:40,482
(chuckling)

974
00:58:42,759 --> 00:58:45,509
(brooding music)

975
00:58:52,981 --> 00:58:54,151
(thumping)

976
00:58:54,151 --> 00:58:56,693
(clockwork ticking)

977
00:58:56,693 --> 00:58:58,773
- What troubles you My Lord?

978
00:58:58,773 --> 00:59:02,606
- I feel, as if something's
stuck on my brain.

979
00:59:04,473 --> 00:59:07,306
As if my doom, was just writ down.

980
00:59:08,364 --> 00:59:09,510
Have you found the old man?

981
00:59:09,510 --> 00:59:11,628
- The search continues exalted one.

982
00:59:11,628 --> 00:59:13,834
But you need not concern
yourself with Merlin,

983
00:59:13,834 --> 00:59:16,008
without his ring he can do no harm.

984
00:59:16,008 --> 00:59:17,258
- That's right.

985
00:59:18,451 --> 00:59:21,254
Perhaps I am a fool to worry about Merlin.

986
00:59:21,254 --> 00:59:22,616
(clockwork ticking)

987
00:59:22,616 --> 00:59:26,740
And again, perhaps you are a fool not to.

988
00:59:26,740 --> 00:59:28,611
Which do you think it is?

989
00:59:28,611 --> 00:59:29,671
(clockwork ticking)
- Do you wish me to answer,

990
00:59:29,671 --> 00:59:33,118
My Lord?
- I wish you to find him!

991
00:59:33,118 --> 00:59:35,914
He lives to plot, that one!

992
00:59:35,914 --> 00:59:39,502
I do not doubt he is
plotting against me even now!

993
00:59:39,502 --> 00:59:41,755
(clockwork ticking)
Find him!

994
00:59:41,755 --> 00:59:42,588
Find him!

995
00:59:46,997 --> 00:59:49,616
- In the name of Heaven,

996
00:59:49,616 --> 00:59:52,006
what did you do, where did they go?

997
00:59:52,006 --> 00:59:55,608
- (sighs) Look, I don't know, I mean,

998
00:59:55,608 --> 00:59:58,394
besides look, it's not
me, that's doing it,

999
00:59:58,394 --> 01:00:00,255
it's this ring!

1000
01:00:00,255 --> 01:00:01,664
- The ring!

1001
01:00:01,664 --> 01:00:04,876
I did not believe when
I saw it on your finger.

1002
01:00:04,876 --> 01:00:07,436
Then it be true, just as Merlin said.

1003
01:00:07,436 --> 01:00:09,894
You have brought it back
from the after times!

1004
01:00:09,894 --> 01:00:12,190
From the days that have not yet been!

1005
01:00:12,190 --> 01:00:13,969
- We came from the 20th century.

1006
01:00:13,969 --> 01:00:16,153
- Late in the 20th century.

1007
01:00:16,153 --> 01:00:18,235
- I came back because
I need Merlin's help!

1008
01:00:18,235 --> 01:00:20,168
Do you know where he is?

1009
01:00:20,168 --> 01:00:23,285
- I know, but it is he
that needs the help!

1010
01:00:23,285 --> 01:00:25,696
- Look, I accidentally
made my sister disappear,

1011
01:00:25,696 --> 01:00:28,102
and I need Merlin's help to get her back!

1012
01:00:28,102 --> 01:00:30,389
- Merlin hoped for a hero,

1013
01:00:30,389 --> 01:00:34,917
and instead the ring brings
back a boy, and an old man.

1014
01:00:34,917 --> 01:00:36,412
What hope do we have now?

1015
01:00:36,412 --> 01:00:37,745
- Ah, excuse me?

1016
01:00:38,711 --> 01:00:41,464
- Only the ring can fight the ring!

1017
01:00:41,464 --> 01:00:42,969
Merlin used the last of his powers

1018
01:00:42,969 --> 01:00:45,761
to open a door to the days
that have not yet been,

1019
01:00:45,761 --> 01:00:47,620
hoping that some future hero would

1020
01:00:47,620 --> 01:00:50,709
bear the token back again,
and defeat Malfeasor.

1021
01:00:50,709 --> 01:00:53,461
- Great, and I'm what he got.

1022
01:00:53,461 --> 01:00:55,794
Look, I'm no Schwarzenegger!

1023
01:00:57,008 --> 01:00:58,796
What if we just give the ring to Merlin,

1024
01:00:58,796 --> 01:01:00,845
and he can fight Malfeasor?

1025
01:01:00,845 --> 01:01:02,392
- I will take you, tonight!

1026
01:01:02,392 --> 01:01:05,972
He dwells in hiding now,
deep in the tainted wood.

1027
01:01:05,972 --> 01:01:07,552
- Sounds cozy.

1028
01:01:07,552 --> 01:01:10,302
(brooding music)

1029
01:01:15,189 --> 01:01:18,689
(vigorous resolute music)

1030
01:01:21,278 --> 01:01:24,278
(suspenseful music)

1031
01:01:28,901 --> 01:01:31,401
(crow cawing)

1032
01:01:32,563 --> 01:01:34,407
- What is it old friend?

1033
01:01:34,407 --> 01:01:37,157
(dramatic music)

1034
01:01:41,191 --> 01:01:43,691
(crow cawing)

1035
01:01:49,180 --> 01:01:51,435
(clockwork ticking)
(dramatic music)

1036
01:01:51,435 --> 01:01:54,935
Malfeasor has sent his toys to collect me.

1037
01:01:55,972 --> 01:01:57,639
I should be honored.

1038
01:01:58,633 --> 01:02:00,341
(clockwork ticking)
- Merlin, a man who leaves his

1039
01:02:00,341 --> 01:02:03,381
sign behind on every scroll
he touches cannot expect

1040
01:02:03,381 --> 01:02:06,375
to escape the hounds forever.

1041
01:02:06,375 --> 01:02:08,078
- Once upon a time the hounds

1042
01:02:08,078 --> 01:02:10,071
would have respected my privacy!

1043
01:02:10,071 --> 01:02:11,598
(clockwork ticking)
- No more tricks old man,

1044
01:02:11,598 --> 01:02:13,848
and no more clever sayings.

1045
01:02:16,197 --> 01:02:18,645
(grunting)

1046
01:02:18,645 --> 01:02:21,812
(explosion exploding)

1047
01:02:24,437 --> 01:02:26,901
- Andrea!
(spitting)

1048
01:02:26,901 --> 01:02:28,764
I just spoke to Glenn's parents.

1049
01:02:28,764 --> 01:02:31,252
- My parents, I mean, Glenn's parents?

1050
01:02:31,252 --> 01:02:33,924
- They don't know anything
about a camping trip,

1051
01:02:33,924 --> 01:02:35,771
but I think you do!

1052
01:02:35,771 --> 01:02:37,428
- They forced me not to tell!

1053
01:02:37,428 --> 01:02:39,196
They wanted to go camping
but Glenn's parents

1054
01:02:39,196 --> 01:02:41,299
wouldn't let 'em, so
they went on their own,

1055
01:02:41,299 --> 01:02:43,055
at Lake Cashamont!

1056
01:02:43,055 --> 01:02:45,644
They're fine, I swear,

1057
01:02:45,644 --> 01:02:47,740
but Glenn didn't want
to do it, it was Johnny!

1058
01:02:47,740 --> 01:02:50,984
Johnny forced him to go and
then forced me not to tell!

1059
01:02:50,984 --> 01:02:52,781
- I see this is very bad!

1060
01:02:52,781 --> 01:02:54,975
I'm thinking of calling your parents!

1061
01:02:54,975 --> 01:02:57,242
- You wouldn't want to
ruin their vacation!

1062
01:02:57,242 --> 01:02:59,567
And you can't call them
anyway, there's no phone!

1063
01:02:59,567 --> 01:03:01,001
- I'm telling you cupcake,

1064
01:03:01,001 --> 01:03:02,814
I'm thinking of calling the police!

1065
01:03:02,814 --> 01:03:03,973
- Oh no don't do that!

1066
01:03:03,973 --> 01:03:05,479
They wouldn't be able to
find them before morning,

1067
01:03:05,479 --> 01:03:07,205
and they'll just be wasting their time!

1068
01:03:07,205 --> 01:03:09,123
I swear, please!

1069
01:03:09,123 --> 01:03:11,348
(whooshing)

1070
01:03:11,348 --> 01:03:13,996
(tense music)

1071
01:03:13,996 --> 01:03:15,564
- Are we almost there?

1072
01:03:15,564 --> 01:03:17,981
- It's right around this way!

1073
01:03:22,017 --> 01:03:22,934
Merlin, no!

1074
01:03:31,595 --> 01:03:35,629
They've taken him, back
to Camelot in chains!

1075
01:03:35,629 --> 01:03:38,808
They've taken our last hope with him!

1076
01:03:38,808 --> 01:03:41,916
Malfeasor will have cause
to rejoice this night!

1077
01:03:41,916 --> 01:03:43,530
- There's only one thing we can do!

1078
01:03:43,530 --> 01:03:46,280
- Save ourselves!
- Rescue Merlin!

1079
01:03:47,860 --> 01:03:49,729
- But you're just a boy!

1080
01:03:49,729 --> 01:03:51,009
- And you're just a girl.

1081
01:03:51,009 --> 01:03:53,116
- I'm just a has-been entertainer!

1082
01:03:53,116 --> 01:03:56,001
- Look, none of us is
really hero material.

1083
01:03:56,001 --> 01:03:58,425
But the three of us together, well,

1084
01:03:58,425 --> 01:04:00,421
we can make one real hero!

1085
01:04:00,421 --> 01:04:02,583
Besides, I've got the
ring, it gives us an edge!

1086
01:04:02,583 --> 01:04:05,457
- But, you said you know not how it works.

1087
01:04:05,457 --> 01:04:07,694
- Well, I knew enough
to make those soldiers,

1088
01:04:07,694 --> 01:04:10,002
go wherever they went, and I know we can

1089
01:04:10,002 --> 01:04:11,993
use it to change our form!

1090
01:04:11,993 --> 01:04:14,400
We can make ourselves
look like the soldiers,

1091
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:16,175
and walk right into the castle!

1092
01:04:16,175 --> 01:04:18,190
- And then what?

1093
01:04:18,190 --> 01:04:20,181
- We'll figure something out.

1094
01:04:20,181 --> 01:04:21,481
You coming or not?

1095
01:04:21,481 --> 01:04:22,392
- Of course I'm coming!

1096
01:04:22,392 --> 01:04:24,204
- All right since we got
to figure out something,

1097
01:04:24,204 --> 01:04:26,044
let's just go in the morning, okay?

1098
01:04:26,044 --> 01:04:27,333
- Now!

1099
01:04:27,333 --> 01:04:31,083
(haunting suspenseful music)

1100
01:04:48,930 --> 01:04:51,228
- Look I mean, even if we
do change into soldiers,

1101
01:04:51,228 --> 01:04:53,234
it's not gonna be that easy to just

1102
01:04:53,234 --> 01:04:55,849
stroll in through that gate up there!

1103
01:04:55,849 --> 01:04:58,244
- Why do you not use
the power of your ring,

1104
01:04:58,244 --> 01:04:59,875
you could send them all away!

1105
01:04:59,875 --> 01:05:02,303
- I don't want to do
that if I don't have to.

1106
01:05:02,303 --> 01:05:04,843
I don't know where they go.

1107
01:05:04,843 --> 01:05:06,716
I don't want anybody to get hurt.

1108
01:05:06,716 --> 01:05:08,714
(crickets chirping)
(tense music)

1109
01:05:08,714 --> 01:05:09,989
- [Soldier] All right,
you take the first watch.

1110
01:05:09,989 --> 01:05:11,018
- [Soldier] Right.

1111
01:05:11,018 --> 01:05:12,441
- [Soldier] Be very careful.

1112
01:05:12,441 --> 01:05:13,274
- Them.

1113
01:05:15,467 --> 01:05:16,636
(rumbling)

1114
01:05:16,636 --> 01:05:18,969
- Johnny what are you doing?

1115
01:05:21,141 --> 01:05:23,653
(magical whooshing)

1116
01:05:23,653 --> 01:05:24,833
(tense music)
- Hello.

1117
01:05:24,833 --> 01:05:25,829
- Hello.

1118
01:05:25,829 --> 01:05:27,496
- [Blackmoor] Hello.

1119
01:05:32,205 --> 01:05:35,205
(suspenseful music)

1120
01:05:49,468 --> 01:05:50,912
- [Soldier] They sound a bit peculiar?

1121
01:05:50,912 --> 01:05:53,745
- And, a bit strange, yeah.
- Yeah.

1122
01:05:57,148 --> 01:05:59,313
- Johnny, change us back will you?

1123
01:05:59,313 --> 01:06:00,369
- Okay.

1124
01:06:00,369 --> 01:06:03,286
(magical jingling)

1125
01:06:12,533 --> 01:06:14,997
- Come, come this way.

1126
01:06:14,997 --> 01:06:17,997
(suspenseful music)

1127
01:06:28,858 --> 01:06:31,246
Twas strange, having the form of a man.

1128
01:06:31,246 --> 01:06:33,735
- (chuckles) I don't mind so much having

1129
01:06:33,735 --> 01:06:35,380
the form of a man from the Middle Ages

1130
01:06:35,380 --> 01:06:37,778
I just don't like smelling like him!

1131
01:06:37,778 --> 01:06:40,207
Where are we now, huh?

1132
01:06:40,207 --> 01:06:41,707
Ah, don't tell me.

1133
01:06:43,844 --> 01:06:45,796
King Arthur's round table?

1134
01:06:45,796 --> 01:06:49,229
(regal music)
Oh boy I don't believe it!

1135
01:06:49,229 --> 01:06:50,146
- Tis true.

1136
01:06:51,058 --> 01:06:53,987
Here's where Malfeasor
worked his devil's magic,

1137
01:06:53,987 --> 01:06:57,591
and over-threw King Arthur
and his true knights.

1138
01:06:57,591 --> 01:07:01,341
It was just a year ago,
and it seems forever.

1139
01:07:03,791 --> 01:07:04,624
- Johnny!

1140
01:07:07,344 --> 01:07:09,767
Johnny look at this!

1141
01:07:09,767 --> 01:07:14,510
If I'm not mistaken, this
is the sword from the stone!

1142
01:07:14,510 --> 01:07:15,578
- Wow!

1143
01:07:15,578 --> 01:07:19,418
- The Excalibur (chuckles)!

1144
01:07:19,418 --> 01:07:23,585
Oh boy, just thrown away, I
can't believe it, like trash!

1145
01:07:25,168 --> 01:07:26,844
- Why don't you keep it Mr. Blackmoor?

1146
01:07:26,844 --> 01:07:28,459
- Me, the Excalibur?

1147
01:07:28,459 --> 01:07:31,379
Oh no no no, no I'm not,
I'm not worth of it!

1148
01:07:31,379 --> 01:07:32,587
- Yes you are!

1149
01:07:32,587 --> 01:07:34,375
I believe in you!

1150
01:07:34,375 --> 01:07:38,542
All you have to do is just,
just believe in yourself!

1151
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,712
(magical jingling)

1152
01:07:57,712 --> 01:07:58,962
- Where to now?

1153
01:08:02,314 --> 01:08:03,397
Come on guys.

1154
01:08:11,461 --> 01:08:13,961
(tense music)

1155
01:08:30,967 --> 01:08:33,152
(rumbling)
(dramatic music)

1156
01:08:33,152 --> 01:08:35,259
- Johnny!
- Blackmoor!

1157
01:08:35,259 --> 01:08:36,307
Sprout!
- Johnny!

1158
01:08:36,307 --> 01:08:39,474
(knocking)
- Hey, hey!

1159
01:08:44,136 --> 01:08:44,969
- Merlin.

1160
01:08:57,568 --> 01:09:01,071
(magical whooshing)

1161
01:09:01,071 --> 01:09:04,476
(dramatic music)

1162
01:09:04,476 --> 01:09:07,319
- Do not bother boy, he cannot help you,

1163
01:09:07,319 --> 01:09:09,652
he cannot even help himself.

1164
01:09:11,209 --> 01:09:13,263
(knocking)

1165
01:09:13,263 --> 01:09:14,895
(gasping)

1166
01:09:14,895 --> 01:09:19,062
(clockwork ticking)
(mechanical laughing)

1167
01:09:20,051 --> 01:09:21,022
- Get lost!

1168
01:09:21,022 --> 01:09:24,439
(magical zapping)
- Purt!

1169
01:09:25,437 --> 01:09:26,540
- Disappear!

1170
01:09:26,540 --> 01:09:30,687
(magical zapping)
- Memalax!

1171
01:09:30,687 --> 01:09:32,020
I admire Merlin.

1172
01:09:34,031 --> 01:09:36,448
He always took the long view,

1173
01:09:37,995 --> 01:09:41,266
always a scheme with you old man.

1174
01:09:41,266 --> 01:09:44,522
This I feel is his last scheme.

1175
01:09:44,522 --> 01:09:47,439
You see boy, ring cancels out ring.

1176
01:09:48,688 --> 01:09:51,268
There is no magic that one can cast

1177
01:09:51,268 --> 01:09:53,137
that the other cannot avert.

1178
01:09:53,137 --> 01:09:56,431
And when both rings cancel each other out,

1179
01:09:56,431 --> 01:09:59,014
what is left boy but you and I,

1180
01:09:59,975 --> 01:10:03,808
the way nature made us,
and history carved us.

1181
01:10:05,086 --> 01:10:07,757
And who do you suppose will triumph boy?

1182
01:10:07,757 --> 01:10:09,826
Do you think you will defeat me?

1183
01:10:09,826 --> 01:10:12,667
- You will never defeat Arthur!

1184
01:10:12,667 --> 01:10:14,313
You will never be king!

1185
01:10:14,313 --> 01:10:15,959
- King?

1186
01:10:15,959 --> 01:10:17,626
I spit on all kings!

1187
01:10:18,661 --> 01:10:23,016
I spit on all kingdoms and
castles and great works!

1188
01:10:23,016 --> 01:10:24,219
- Turn to stone!

1189
01:10:24,219 --> 01:10:26,338
(magical whooshing)

1190
01:10:26,338 --> 01:10:28,998
(crackling)
- Memalax!

1191
01:10:28,998 --> 01:10:31,165
I speak no dreams of glory

1192
01:10:32,174 --> 01:10:34,438
and hopes and heroes!

1193
01:10:34,438 --> 01:10:35,771
- Change into a rat!

1194
01:10:35,771 --> 01:10:38,303
(magical ringing)

1195
01:10:38,303 --> 01:10:40,497
- Memalax!
(eerie squeaking)

1196
01:10:40,497 --> 01:10:41,747
Not rat my boy,

1197
01:10:43,878 --> 01:10:45,461
say rather, maggot!

1198
01:10:46,894 --> 01:10:50,811
King Maggot, for I have
sworn to turn this land

1199
01:10:51,711 --> 01:10:55,878
into one vast corpse, and
when the whole of the earth

1200
01:10:56,902 --> 01:10:59,113
is rot and death,

1201
01:10:59,113 --> 01:11:01,696
then King Maggot will rule all!

1202
01:11:04,633 --> 01:11:06,324
(clockwork ticking)

1203
01:11:06,324 --> 01:11:07,157
- Back!

1204
01:11:11,120 --> 01:11:11,953
Get back!

1205
01:11:15,532 --> 01:11:16,699
Back!

1206
01:11:16,699 --> 01:11:18,199
- Ring, disappear!

1207
01:11:20,588 --> 01:11:22,838
(laughing)

1208
01:11:35,547 --> 01:11:37,428
(mechanical clicking)
(hissing)

1209
01:11:37,428 --> 01:11:39,095
- [Mechanicals] Die!

1210
01:11:40,049 --> 01:11:41,499
Die!
(weapons clanking)

1211
01:11:41,499 --> 01:11:43,749
(grunting)

1212
01:11:46,868 --> 01:11:49,868
(magical whooshing)

1213
01:11:52,412 --> 01:11:55,888
- No need for me to avert that silly boy!

1214
01:11:55,888 --> 01:11:58,721
(magical hissing)

1215
01:12:03,458 --> 01:12:07,625
There's no place left to run boy (laughs)!

1216
01:12:09,897 --> 01:12:14,064
(weapons clanking)
(grunting)

1217
01:12:24,339 --> 01:12:27,422
(Malfeasor laughing)

1218
01:12:30,345 --> 01:12:34,512
You forget boy, that if my
ring is shattered this day,

1219
01:12:36,068 --> 01:12:40,405
how then can it exist to
return from future time?

1220
01:12:40,405 --> 01:12:43,882
- But if it must survive,
you must be defeated,

1221
01:12:43,882 --> 01:12:45,051
because it was Merlin who sent the ring

1222
01:12:45,051 --> 01:12:48,343
down through time to me, not you!

1223
01:12:48,343 --> 01:12:50,291
- We will see who will survive!

1224
01:12:50,291 --> 01:12:53,208
(weapons clanking)

1225
01:12:55,527 --> 01:12:57,852
- How can you kill what never lived?

1226
01:12:57,852 --> 01:12:59,613
They have no hearts!

1227
01:12:59,613 --> 01:13:01,255
(weapons clanking)

1228
01:13:01,255 --> 01:13:03,157
(squealing)
(grunting)

1229
01:13:03,157 --> 01:13:06,215
- You are out of your depth boy!

1230
01:13:06,215 --> 01:13:09,029
Do you really want to die here?

1231
01:13:09,029 --> 01:13:11,265
- Do you?
- All of your friends are

1232
01:13:11,265 --> 01:13:14,754
dead by now boy, but you are (mumbles).

1233
01:13:14,754 --> 01:13:16,117
(eerie hissing)

1234
01:13:16,117 --> 01:13:19,534
- I've had enough of this, let me at 'em!

1235
01:13:21,838 --> 01:13:22,671
Excalibur!

1236
01:13:24,886 --> 01:13:27,756
(crunching)
(eerie squealing)

1237
01:13:27,756 --> 01:13:30,432
(Blackmoor laughing)

1238
01:13:30,432 --> 01:13:32,931
Mess with a kid from Brooklyn (laughs)!

1239
01:13:32,931 --> 01:13:34,638
(grunting)
(weapons clanking)

1240
01:13:34,638 --> 01:13:38,866
- I can give you your
life boy, for a price!

1241
01:13:38,866 --> 01:13:40,379
- What price?

1242
01:13:40,379 --> 01:13:44,889
- For the ring of course,
bid it flying to me!

1243
01:13:44,889 --> 01:13:48,056
How much more powerful with two rings!

1244
01:13:48,994 --> 01:13:50,494
How vast my reach!

1245
01:13:52,297 --> 01:13:54,439
- Why would I trust you?

1246
01:13:54,439 --> 01:13:58,272
- I swear by the ring
itself, if I lie to you,

1247
01:13:59,652 --> 01:14:01,735
may its power destroy me!

1248
01:14:05,491 --> 01:14:08,896
You see boy, I am not destroyed.

1249
01:14:08,896 --> 01:14:11,010
I cannot steal the ring boy,

1250
01:14:11,010 --> 01:14:13,945
it has to be given to me freely.

1251
01:14:13,945 --> 01:14:17,112
I tricked Merlin into giving it to me.

1252
01:14:18,232 --> 01:14:19,907
There are no tricks for you boy,

1253
01:14:19,907 --> 01:14:23,632
just hand me the ring,
and I will see no harm

1254
01:14:23,632 --> 01:14:26,396
will come to you, I will
send you back to your time!

1255
01:14:26,396 --> 01:14:28,886
What more can I say?

1256
01:14:28,886 --> 01:14:32,288
- I will never give you this ring!

1257
01:14:32,288 --> 01:14:33,705
- Very well then,

1258
01:14:35,555 --> 01:14:38,171
ring cancels out ring!

1259
01:14:38,171 --> 01:14:39,838
Flesh cancels flesh!

1260
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:45,841
(dramatic music)
(grunting)

1261
01:14:45,841 --> 01:14:50,008
(weapons clanking)
(grunting)

1262
01:14:58,755 --> 01:15:00,255
- I can't break...

1263
01:15:02,193 --> 01:15:06,360
(grunting)
(weapons clanking)

1264
01:15:08,066 --> 01:15:11,395
- No more words boy, save one!

1265
01:15:11,395 --> 01:15:12,228
Die!

1266
01:15:13,813 --> 01:15:17,784
(grunting)
(eerie squealing)

1267
01:15:17,784 --> 01:15:20,020
(cage rattling)

1268
01:15:20,020 --> 01:15:23,207
Die!
(Blackmoor grunting)

1269
01:15:23,207 --> 01:15:25,760
(eerie shrieking)

1270
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:26,593
Die, die!

1271
01:15:30,461 --> 01:15:31,361
(sizzling)
(mystical humming)

1272
01:15:31,361 --> 01:15:32,194
Ah!

1273
01:15:36,217 --> 01:15:37,965
- Merlin, break free!

1274
01:15:37,965 --> 01:15:39,471
(mystical sizzling)

1275
01:15:39,471 --> 01:15:42,358
(grunting)

1276
01:15:42,358 --> 01:15:46,826
- Banish!
(mystical sputtering)

1277
01:15:46,826 --> 01:15:49,159
- Boy, use the king's sword!

1278
01:15:51,094 --> 01:15:53,674
- Excalibur, find his heart!

1279
01:15:53,674 --> 01:15:56,812
(mystical humming)

1280
01:15:56,812 --> 01:16:00,979
(screaming)
(mystical sizzling)

1281
01:16:11,915 --> 01:16:15,043
(jingling)
(somber music)

1282
01:16:15,043 --> 01:16:17,876
- All things that live and breath,

1283
01:16:19,658 --> 01:16:22,825
unto the fires of Hell I consign thee!

1284
01:16:25,441 --> 01:16:27,691
(groaning)

1285
01:16:32,786 --> 01:16:35,119
- You've done well my child,

1286
01:16:35,968 --> 01:16:36,885
all of you.

1287
01:16:39,374 --> 01:16:42,229
(birds chirping)

1288
01:16:42,229 --> 01:16:44,892
- [Blackmoor] I'm so
nervous, do I look all right?

1289
01:16:44,892 --> 01:16:47,440
- [Johnny] Mr. Blackmoor,
it's the Middle Ages.

1290
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:50,215
- [Blackmoor] Oh, right,
right, right, I, I forgot.

1291
01:16:50,215 --> 01:16:53,048
(officious music)

1292
01:17:12,309 --> 01:17:15,284
- Merlin has told us of thee, my son.

1293
01:17:15,284 --> 01:17:17,783
- We owe you our lives,

1294
01:17:17,783 --> 01:17:20,892
and the lives of all of our subjects.

1295
01:17:20,892 --> 01:17:22,895
- But what of you sir, who wielded

1296
01:17:22,895 --> 01:17:24,812
my Excalibur so boldly?

1297
01:17:26,498 --> 01:17:27,831
- Me Your Highness?

1298
01:17:27,831 --> 01:17:31,081
I'm, I'm no one, I'm, just a trickster,

1299
01:17:33,356 --> 01:17:34,439
a drunk, see?

1300
01:17:36,234 --> 01:17:37,497
- Would that more of my knights

1301
01:17:37,497 --> 01:17:40,247
might drink from the same vessel.

1302
01:17:42,746 --> 01:17:44,746
- Take it Your Highness!

1303
01:17:47,705 --> 01:17:49,705
I don't need it anymore.

1304
01:17:53,184 --> 01:17:54,851
- Hmm, I thank thee.

1305
01:17:56,480 --> 01:17:59,862
Thou hast done well, thou hast earned

1306
01:17:59,862 --> 01:18:03,399
the gratitude of Arthur
and of all Camelot.

1307
01:18:03,399 --> 01:18:07,566
Now mayest kneel and bow
thy heads, (mumbles).

1308
01:18:14,380 --> 01:18:18,463
For thy courage, and the
salvation of my kingdom,

1309
01:18:19,642 --> 01:18:23,225
I make thee knight,
Sir John, Lord of Mist.

1310
01:18:31,092 --> 01:18:34,009
And for thy courage too, trickster,

1311
01:18:35,166 --> 01:18:37,249
Sir Sydney, of Blackmoor.

1312
01:18:38,650 --> 01:18:40,150
Rise then knights.

1313
01:18:43,261 --> 01:18:45,928
Love honor, obey the knighthood.

1314
01:18:46,845 --> 01:18:51,335
- My noble Lord, I fear I
must bear these two away.

1315
01:18:51,335 --> 01:18:56,069
(sighing)
- Then, fare thee well,

1316
01:18:56,069 --> 01:18:58,486
in thy lands beyond tomorrow.

1317
01:19:00,588 --> 01:19:04,716
And one moment, I would
ask thee a question,

1318
01:19:04,716 --> 01:19:06,549
of the days yet to be.

1319
01:19:07,467 --> 01:19:10,200
- I'll answer if I can.

1320
01:19:10,200 --> 01:19:13,367
- In thy future time, am I remembered?

1321
01:19:15,144 --> 01:19:17,977
- Yes, Your Highness, yes you are.

1322
01:19:19,463 --> 01:19:24,017
- With, fondness (chuckles)?

1323
01:19:24,017 --> 01:19:24,850
- Yeah.

1324
01:19:26,972 --> 01:19:31,139
- Tis a good thing, to be
remembered with fondness.

1325
01:19:34,785 --> 01:19:35,618
Godspeed.

1326
01:19:38,614 --> 01:19:40,198
- Come!

1327
01:19:40,198 --> 01:19:42,698
(regal music)

1328
01:19:51,295 --> 01:19:54,212
(flames crackling)

1329
01:19:55,478 --> 01:20:00,031
Now, you know what to do to
restore your noble sister?

1330
01:20:00,031 --> 01:20:01,945
- Yes, I understand.

1331
01:20:01,945 --> 01:20:05,695
- Good, and now, we must
finish the business!

1332
01:20:09,162 --> 01:20:10,495
- Finish, but...

1333
01:20:12,027 --> 01:20:13,400
I-I thought that...

1334
01:20:13,400 --> 01:20:16,680
- Oh, just because Malfeasor is dead?

1335
01:20:16,680 --> 01:20:18,636
And the royal prince is restored,

1336
01:20:18,636 --> 01:20:20,876
and the last chapter is
written, oh no no no.

1337
01:20:20,876 --> 01:20:24,305
The first chapter needs to be completed.

1338
01:20:24,305 --> 01:20:25,138
Look.

1339
01:20:27,210 --> 01:20:28,989
You see this ring?

1340
01:20:28,989 --> 01:20:33,183
This ring was cast by fires
from the edge of the world.

1341
01:20:33,183 --> 01:20:36,600
10 times 100 years I have worn this ring!

1342
01:20:38,630 --> 01:20:40,880
No more, it's passed me by.

1343
01:20:41,841 --> 01:20:44,758
Now, I bequeath it to you my child,

1344
01:20:47,335 --> 01:20:50,661
the ring, along with the sacred scrolls

1345
01:20:50,661 --> 01:20:52,783
that I shall give to you.

1346
01:20:52,783 --> 01:20:55,700
Pass them on, daughter to daughter.

1347
01:20:56,980 --> 01:20:59,527
And the ways, and the
words I will teach you.

1348
01:20:59,527 --> 01:21:00,944
Do not be afraid.

1349
01:21:01,978 --> 01:21:03,895
- I will not be afraid.

1350
01:21:05,147 --> 01:21:08,833
For if it hasn't happened
yet, it just may.

1351
01:21:08,833 --> 01:21:09,990
- Oh don't tell me that,

1352
01:21:09,990 --> 01:21:12,836
your granny said that to you, right?

1353
01:21:12,836 --> 01:21:16,005
- No, I thought it up myself.

1354
01:21:16,005 --> 01:21:18,576
- By the blood child, your blood,

1355
01:21:18,576 --> 01:21:23,230
the burden will be carried
through to Sir John's time.

1356
01:21:23,230 --> 01:21:26,196
- I will not fail.
- She won't.

1357
01:21:26,196 --> 01:21:28,363
I mean, she didn't, but...

1358
01:21:31,519 --> 01:21:33,436
If she keeps that ring,

1359
01:21:35,632 --> 01:21:37,371
what about this one?

1360
01:21:37,371 --> 01:21:39,756
- Well, all shall be revealed.

1361
01:21:39,756 --> 01:21:42,032
The ring is in good hands.

1362
01:21:42,032 --> 01:21:45,365
Sir John of Mist, raise your right hand.

1363
01:21:51,654 --> 01:21:53,821
Press it to the parchment.

1364
01:21:56,124 --> 01:21:57,624
- Godspeed heroes.

1365
01:22:01,162 --> 01:22:02,329
And thank you.

1366
01:22:04,696 --> 01:22:08,677
- Wait a minute kid, you ain't
going anywhere without me.

1367
01:22:08,677 --> 01:22:10,113
Bye.

1368
01:22:10,113 --> 01:22:10,946
- Bye.

1369
01:22:11,831 --> 01:22:12,664
- Bye.

1370
01:22:14,722 --> 01:22:18,889
(dramatic music)
(mystical humming)

1371
01:22:20,851 --> 01:22:25,018
(thunder booming)
(magical sizzling)

1372
01:22:28,565 --> 01:22:31,360
(magical whooshing)

1373
01:22:31,360 --> 01:22:33,360
- The circle, is closed!

1374
01:22:37,060 --> 01:22:38,534
(mystical booming)

1375
01:22:38,534 --> 01:22:40,646
- [Blackmoor] Ah!

1376
01:22:40,646 --> 01:22:43,396
Aw, oh no, we're up a tree again!

1377
01:22:44,846 --> 01:22:49,013
Oh boy that Merlin he's sure
got a sense of humor, huh?

1378
01:22:50,198 --> 01:22:51,600
- Come on we gotta hurry!

1379
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:54,267
(anxious music)

1380
01:22:59,850 --> 01:23:02,933
(Blackmoor laughing)

1381
01:23:06,746 --> 01:23:09,565
- Hey this is really
cool, did you build this?

1382
01:23:09,565 --> 01:23:10,898
- [Johnny] Yeah!

1383
01:23:12,207 --> 01:23:13,707
- Hey you're back!

1384
01:23:16,687 --> 01:23:19,937
- This isn't working, it's not working!

1385
01:23:25,406 --> 01:23:26,813
- Boy I hope you've had a good time,

1386
01:23:26,813 --> 01:23:28,488
'cause while you've been
messing around in some

1387
01:23:28,488 --> 01:23:31,843
medieval theme park I've been
going through a living hell!

1388
01:23:31,843 --> 01:23:34,158
- Well Glenn I can't change you back yet!

1389
01:23:34,158 --> 01:23:36,598
- Your parents are
coming home any time now.

1390
01:23:36,598 --> 01:23:38,284
What did you say?

1391
01:23:38,284 --> 01:23:40,295
- Look Glenn, I can't change you back yet!

1392
01:23:40,295 --> 01:23:42,011
The real Andrea has to be here first!

1393
01:23:42,011 --> 01:23:43,839
- Then what are you waiting for?

1394
01:23:43,839 --> 01:23:45,699
- Look, go watch out for Rose, okay?

1395
01:23:45,699 --> 01:23:47,621
- Can do, no problem.

1396
01:23:47,621 --> 01:23:50,288
(anxious music)

1397
01:23:52,152 --> 01:23:54,430
- Hold on, hold on, move over, move over.

1398
01:23:54,430 --> 01:23:56,442
When you deal with the
kind of equipment I got,

1399
01:23:56,442 --> 01:23:57,884
you get used to doing this kind of stuff

1400
01:23:57,884 --> 01:24:00,322
30 seconds before air time.

1401
01:24:00,322 --> 01:24:03,623
(tense music)

1402
01:24:03,623 --> 01:24:07,123
(vacuum cleaner whirring)

1403
01:24:10,651 --> 01:24:12,901
(thumping)

1404
01:24:18,797 --> 01:24:19,993
- Come on!

1405
01:24:19,993 --> 01:24:22,660
(anxious music)

1406
01:24:24,998 --> 01:24:25,880
- Ah!

1407
01:24:25,880 --> 01:24:28,963
(Blackmoor laughing)

1408
01:24:31,154 --> 01:24:34,654
(vacuum cleaner whirring)

1409
01:24:36,657 --> 01:24:40,824
- Okay kid, you're on (chuckles)!

1410
01:24:48,707 --> 01:24:50,968
Come on kid, show me what you got!

1411
01:24:50,968 --> 01:24:55,899
- As you can see, no secret
panels, no trap doors,

1412
01:24:55,899 --> 01:24:58,406
no place to hide.
- Spin it!

1413
01:24:58,406 --> 01:25:02,573
- Now, I just spin, the box
in the opposite direction.

1414
01:25:03,464 --> 01:25:05,714
I will say the magic words!

1415
01:25:06,607 --> 01:25:07,724
- Faster!

1416
01:25:07,724 --> 01:25:10,057
- Toomara, toomaru, toomara!

1417
01:25:11,848 --> 01:25:16,015
(echoing)
Toomaru, toomara, toomaru!

1418
01:25:17,621 --> 01:25:19,507
Andrea, reappear!

1419
01:25:19,507 --> 01:25:22,174
(anxious music)

1420
01:25:26,273 --> 01:25:28,690
- Johnny, Johnny, Rose alert!

1421
01:25:31,629 --> 01:25:33,962
- Toomara, toomaru, toomara!

1422
01:25:36,314 --> 01:25:37,399
Toomaru!

1423
01:25:37,399 --> 01:25:40,499
(magical ringing)

1424
01:25:40,499 --> 01:25:43,249
(dramatic music)

1425
01:25:45,071 --> 01:25:48,383
- Wow, you made all the kids disappear.

1426
01:25:48,383 --> 01:25:50,716
Hey, she looks just like me!

1427
01:25:52,607 --> 01:25:54,195
- Glenn, get inside!

1428
01:25:54,195 --> 01:25:57,528
(comically tense music)

1429
01:26:03,336 --> 01:26:05,083
- Johnny Mysto!

1430
01:26:05,083 --> 01:26:07,916
You're in a big trouble young man!

1431
01:26:10,578 --> 01:26:13,578
(suspenseful music)

1432
01:26:14,847 --> 01:26:17,730
Johnny, what do you have
to say for yourself?

1433
01:26:17,730 --> 01:26:19,545
- [Glenn] Uh, we went camping!

1434
01:26:19,545 --> 01:26:20,724
- What?
- We went camping,

1435
01:26:20,724 --> 01:26:22,402
it's all your fault!

1436
01:26:22,402 --> 01:26:24,959
- We, we were on a camping trip, and,

1437
01:26:24,959 --> 01:26:26,459
it's all my fault!

1438
01:26:27,650 --> 01:26:29,549
- Who are you?

1439
01:26:29,549 --> 01:26:30,921
- Uh...
- You're the man from

1440
01:26:30,921 --> 01:26:33,675
the cable, I recognize you!

1441
01:26:33,675 --> 01:26:34,639
- Would you like an autograph?

1442
01:26:34,639 --> 01:26:35,472
- No!

1443
01:26:36,374 --> 01:26:38,543
Johnny, where is Glenn?

1444
01:26:38,543 --> 01:26:42,626
- Oh, Glenn, uh, I, I
don't know, where is Glenn?

1445
01:26:43,785 --> 01:26:45,544
- I asked you first.

1446
01:26:45,544 --> 01:26:48,213
- Hey Andrea, I better give
you your lucky coin, huh?

1447
01:26:48,213 --> 01:26:50,255
- Yeah where's my coin?

1448
01:26:50,255 --> 01:26:52,997
- Andrea, Andrea thank goodness!

1449
01:26:52,997 --> 01:26:54,553
Your voice is back in normal.

1450
01:26:54,553 --> 01:26:56,147
- It is?
- It sure would be nice

1451
01:26:56,147 --> 01:26:58,219
to have that coin, I bet if I open this up

1452
01:26:58,219 --> 01:27:00,136
I'll get it right here!

1453
01:27:01,867 --> 01:27:02,700
Here.

1454
01:27:05,917 --> 01:27:07,475
(dramatic music)

1455
01:27:07,475 --> 01:27:08,308
Yes, yes!

1456
01:27:16,872 --> 01:27:18,731
- Ha, I'm back to normal!

1457
01:27:18,731 --> 01:27:21,648
- Glenn, there you are!
- Yes, yeah!

1458
01:27:23,201 --> 01:27:24,534
Oh yes I'm back!

1459
01:27:26,126 --> 01:27:29,714
It's so good to see you (chuckles)!

1460
01:27:29,714 --> 01:27:31,046
Yes, yes!
(slapping)

1461
01:27:31,046 --> 01:27:31,940
Whoo!

1462
01:27:31,940 --> 01:27:34,940
- There there Glenn, it's all right!

1463
01:27:37,994 --> 01:27:39,661
- Hello, we're back!

1464
01:27:43,774 --> 01:27:46,365
- Look Rose, I did
something really stupid,

1465
01:27:46,365 --> 01:27:48,354
I'm really sorry.

1466
01:27:48,354 --> 01:27:51,696
If you tell mom and dad, I'll understand.

1467
01:27:51,696 --> 01:27:54,779
- Well then, if there's no harm done,

1468
01:27:55,955 --> 01:27:58,965
let it be our little secret, huh?

1469
01:27:58,965 --> 01:28:00,235
(sighing)
To tell the truth Johnny,

1470
01:28:00,235 --> 01:28:02,154
I didn't think you had it in you.

1471
01:28:02,154 --> 01:28:05,092
- To tell you the truth, neither did I.

1472
01:28:05,092 --> 01:28:07,934
(crickets chirping)

1473
01:28:07,934 --> 01:28:09,512

- Prepare to be amazed!
- Our boy!

1479
01:28:24,637 --> 01:28:26,983
- Their boy!
- Go Johnny!

1480
01:28:26,983 --> 01:28:30,128
Go Johnny, go Johnny, go Johnny,

1481
01:28:30,128 --> 01:28:33,356
(clapping)
everybody, go Johnny, go...

1482
01:28:33,356 --> 01:28:35,763
You are so off cue.

♫ Tonight in my hand

1486
01:29:01,858 --> 01:29:06,266
♫ I got a place that's magic for me

1487
01:29:06,266 --> 01:29:10,563

1488
01:29:10,563 --> 01:29:12,333
♫ And go away (mumbles)

1489
01:29:12,333 --> 01:29:16,500
♫ I can go back in time,
to save the one I love

1490
