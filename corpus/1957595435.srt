00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,840

127
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,140
[Lilly] I know

128
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:42,020
Umm.. i was wondering do you think any of the guys are hot, like Troy?

129
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:49,240
[Anna] I don't know, Troy is cute but he is a Ken doll and i....

130
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,480
[Lilly and Anna Screaming] Aaahh!!!

131
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,560
[Mack] Who buys this crap huh?

132
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,640
[Carl] Check it out guys

133
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,100
[Troy] It's a... Big Foot

134
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:05,320
[Mack] It's a Skunk Ape these thing are been around for centuries

135
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,300
Long before the Native Americans were even here

136
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,260
[Mack] You need to get laid, Urkle

137
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,920
You sound like a dork

138
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,120
[Troy] Hey man, don't listen to him
He's trying to pick a fight you know..

139
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:17,740
[Carl] Whatever

140
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,680
[CHIEF NADJO] I hope you don't plan on camping around here this weekend.

141
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:32,180
[Professor] Yes, we’re here for the pollution study.

142
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,040
[CHIEF NADJO] That's important work.

143
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:36,860
But there is no camping this weekend

144
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:40,660
All the local tribes gather for The Blood Moon ceremonies

145
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,320
So the reservation are off limits
[Professor Interrupting] My name is Richard Stein

146
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:48,520
and this piece of paper here says that we have state clearance to be here.

147
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,920
As you can see that's a state property.

148
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,080
[Professor] Come minions!

149
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:03,160
[CHIEF NADJO] Your teacher is kind of a Dick

150
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,360
[Carl] Pretty much
[Troy] Yeah.. Agreed

151
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,980
[CHIEF NADJO] It's a dangerous time right now

152
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:09,700
tread carefully

153
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:14,080
[Carl] how much for the....

154
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:15,360
[CHIEF] 20 dollars

155
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:50,120
[RANGER STEVE] Hey Richard, how's it going?

156
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,960
[Professor] Where were you? we have been waiting for hours

157
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,720
[STEVE] Eh, I just came down from shuttling your guide over to the camp

158
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,880
Okay? I didn’t think you’d be here so soon.

159
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,220
[Professor] Class, this is Ranger Steve

160
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:02,700
He is gonna let us stay here overnight and use the park facilities

161
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,640
[RANGER STEVE] Hey guys

162
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,060
I’ll be at the station all weekend while y’all are here, okay?

163
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,220
Ready to go?
[Students] Yes!

164
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:14,180
[Anna] Yeah, I’d so let him do me

165
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,860
[Wendy] Mmm...I would just eat him up like dutch apple

166
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:25,580
[Lilly] Uh, I would totally hit that too.
I would let him patrol my wetland

167
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:28,580
Right? i would let him explore my marsh

168
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:33,800
heh, yest? I’d let him motorboat through my swampy Netherlands

169
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:36,880
[Anna and Wendy] Eww...

170
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,260
[Lilly] Let's go

171
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:45,380
[RANGER STEVE] Ready to go?

172
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:49,780
[Professor] We sure are. Everybody load your gear on the boat. We’re getting ready head out.

173
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,300
[Anna] Wait a minute.. we are taking a boat there?

174
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:56,320
[STEVE] Yes sweetheart, most of the year the camp is surrounded by water

175
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,680
[Anna] Nobody told me anything, i didn't even know we are camping on an island

176
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:03,040
[Professor] I didn't think it matter how we go to camp.

177
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:06,380
[Anna] No, uh-uh, I need civilization.

178
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:10,880
[Professor] Look, we’ve arranged to have a wilderness guide stay with us for safety sake

179
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:13,780

You got to understand

331
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:06,940
Last thing i thought i'd be doing this weekend is hanging out with science club

332
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:10,180
But Professor Stein you know he called me in and gave me an ultimatum

336
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:21,900
important game of my life and he still made me come here

337
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:24,580
It's the qualifier for the state finals which are tomorrow

338
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:28,100

[Theo] Well listen, that's a nest.
We found that around here last week

349
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:23,640
[Lilly] Really? cause this is the same type of nest that a gorilla would make

350
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:25,020
[Professor] And a deer.

351
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:30,320

if you are implying that whole Big foot Legend

352
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:32,380
then you are being ridiculous

353
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,520
[Lilly] Professor take a look at this
Its a sample

354
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,100
[Professor] Hair

355
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:43,140
[Theo] It's primate hair
You see Professor i found one of those

356
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:44,940
in those "deer-nest" last week

357
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:48,340
As a man of science i look to find a truth

358
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,560
and the unknown..
[Professor] That's enough

359
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:53,420
[Professor] Let's not forget what we came here for

360
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,180
Look we'll start collecting samples first thing in the morning

361
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:59,620
Hopefully we're out of here by six or seven o'clock

362
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:00,340
[Troy] Yes!

363
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:13,160
[Wendy] This place is kind of creepy at night
Don't you think?

364
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,060
[Lilly] Yeah. i feel like an Alligator is gonna come out of the bushes and

365
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:19,340
just drag us into the river or something crazy

366
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:21,940
[Troy] Hey Theo

367
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:24,560
What was that...

368
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:29,540
Skunk ape stuff you and Professor were talking about when i went into the lab

369
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,800
[Theo] Swamp apes
[Troy] Swamp apes

370
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:35,320
[Theo] That's what they call technically because they are not related to skunks

371
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:39,400
They have this horrible stench

372
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:42,520
You can always smell them because you see them

373
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,420
[Troy] Have you ever seen one?

374
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:48,640
[Theo] yeah

375
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:51,160
Once when i was six

376
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,120
Just once

377
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:56,080
[Carl] Seriously?

378
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:57,800
[Theo] Oh yeah.

379
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:02,280
[Theo] It was at my house in the suburbs

380
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,020
just about a mile from here

381
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,620
Me and friend were playing in the backyard close to the woods

382
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:14,480
We looked up and there it was

383
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,600
staring right at us

384
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,960
Just a few yards away

385
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:24,380
It looked like this huge

386
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,120
Orangutan on two feet

387
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:29,260
With his piercing eyes

388
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:34,380
Then we heard this horrible crying sound come from the woods

389
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,220
And boom, took off, Gone!

390
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:40,260
Never saw it again

391
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:43,300
Told our parents
ofcourse nobody believed us

392
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:50,320
[Wendy] Thanks Theo.
Now i won't be able to sleep tonight

393
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:53,380
[Theo] I will tell you what

394
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,780
Sometimes..when i am out here in the woods alone

395
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,280
[Theo] Rubbing one out

396
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:04,380

397
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:06,660
Looking at me through the trees

398
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,180

00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:52,400
Now look what happened
[Troy] It wasn't our fault we..

768
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:54,060
[Chief] Of course it was your fault

769
00:54:54,060 --> 00:54:59,860
And this youngling doesn’t need to speak to let me know you’ve physically assualted him as well

770
00:54:59,860 --> 00:55:02,540
[Lilly] Theo just wanted to prove it existed

00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:09,960
Your society is doing the same thing to the
Esti Capcaki species

If you are truly sorry, you will help me lift this precious creature into the boat

777
00:55:24,420 --> 00:55:26,740
[Troy] Is he.. Is he still alive?

778
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:30,500
[Chief] He's only knocked out
You are in no danger now anyway

779
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:34,980
The blood moon is over.
This was his time to find a mate.

780
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,440
and be free

781
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:44,540

782
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:50,280
