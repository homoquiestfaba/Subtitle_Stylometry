00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,140
[Lilly] I know

128
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:42,020
Umm.. i was wondering do you think any of the guys are hot, like Troy?

129
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:49,240
[Anna] I don't know, Troy is cute but he is a Ken doll and i....

130
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,480
[Lilly and Anna Screaming] Aaahh!!!

131
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,560
[Mack] Who buys this crap huh?

132
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,640
[Carl] Check it out guys

133
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,100
[Troy] It's a... Big Foot

134
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:05,320
[Mack] It's a Skunk Ape these thing are been around for centuries

135
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,300
Long before the Native Americans were even here

136
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,260
[Mack] You need to get laid, Urkle

137
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,920
You sound like a dork

138
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,120
[Troy] Hey man, don't listen to him
He's trying to pick a fight you know..

139
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:17,740
[Carl] Whatever

140
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,680
[CHIEF NADJO] I hope you don't plan on camping around here this weekend.

141
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:32,180
[Professor] Yes, weâ€™re here for the pollution study.

142
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,040
[CHIEF NADJO] That's important work.

143
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:36,860
But there is no camping this weekend

144
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:40,660
All the local tribes gather for The Blood Moon ceremonies

145
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,320
So the reservation are off limits
[Professor Interrupting] My name is Richard Stein

146
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:48,520
and this piece of paper here says that we have state clearance to be here.

147
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,920
As you can see that's a state property.

148
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,080
[Professor] Come minions!

149
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:03,160
[CHIEF NADJO] Your teacher is kind of a Dick

150
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,360
[Carl] Pretty much
[Troy] Yeah.. Agreed

151
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,980
[CHIEF NADJO] It's a dangerous time right now

152
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:09,700
tread carefully

153
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:14,080
[Carl] how much for the....

154
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:15,360
[CHIEF] 20 dollars

155
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:50,120
[RANGER STEVE] Hey Richard, how's it going?

156
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,960
[Professor] Where were you? we have been waiting for hours

157
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,720
[STEVE] Eh, I just came down from shuttling your guide over to the camp

158
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,880
Okay? I didnâ€™t think youâ€™d be here so soon.

159
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,220
[Professor] Class, this is Ranger Steve

160
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:02,700
He is gonna let us stay here overnight and use the park facilities

161
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,640
[RANGER STEVE] Hey guys

162
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,060
Iâ€™ll be at the station all weekend while yâ€™all are here, okay?

163
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,220
Ready to go?
[Students] Yes!

164
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:14,180
[Anna] Yeah, Iâ€™d so let him do me

165
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,860
[Wendy] Mmm...I would just eat him up like dutch apple

166
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:25,580
[Lilly] Uh, I would totally hit that too.
I would let him patrol my wetland

167
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:28,580
Right? i would let him explore my marsh

168
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:33,800
heh, yest? Iâ€™d let him motorboat through my swampy Netherlands

169
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:36,880
[Anna and Wendy] Eww...

170
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,260
[Lilly] Let's go

171
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:45,380
[RANGER STEVE] Ready to go?

172
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:49,780
[Professor] We sure are. Everybody load your gear on the boat. Weâ€™re getting ready head out.

173
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,300
[Anna] Wait a minute.. we are taking a boat there?

174
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:56,320
[STEVE] Yes sweetheart, most of the year the camp is surrounded by water

175
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,680
[Anna] Nobody told me anything, i didn't even know we are camping on an island

176
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:03,040
[Professor] I didn't think it matter how we go to camp.

177
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:06,380
[Anna] No, uh-uh, I need civilization.

178
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:10,880
[Professor] Look, weâ€™ve arranged to have a wilderness guide stay with us for safety sake

179
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:13,780

You got to understand

331
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:06,940
Last thing i thought i'd be doing this weekend is hanging out with science club

332
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:10,180
But Professor Stein you know he called me in and gave me an ultimatum

334
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,860

336
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:21,900
important game of my life and he still made me come here

337
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:24,580
It's the qualifier for the state finals which are tomorrow

338
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:28,100

[Theo] Well listen, that's a nest.
We found that around here last week

349
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:23,640
[Lilly] Really? cause this is the same type of nest that a gorilla would make

350
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:25,020
[Professor] And a deer.

351
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:30,320
Look i am sorry. As a man of science
if you are implying that whole Big foot Legend

352
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:32,380
then you are being ridiculous

353
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,520
[Lilly] Professor take a look at this
Its a sample

354
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,100
[Professor] Hair

355
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:43,140
[Theo] It's primate hair
You see Professor i found one of those

356
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:44,940
in those "deer-nest" last week

357
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:48,340
As a man of science i look to find a truth

358
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,560
and the unknown..
[Professor] That's enough

359
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:53,420
[Professor] Let's not forget what we came here for

360
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,180
Look we'll start collecting samples first thing in the morning

361
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:59,620
Hopefully we're out of here by six or seven o'clock

362
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:00,340
[Troy] Yes!

363
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:13,160
[Wendy] This place is kind of creepy at night
Don't you think?

364
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,060
[Lilly] Yeah. i feel like an Alligator is gonna come out of the bushes and

365
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:19,340
just drag us into the river or something crazy

366
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:21,940
[Troy] Hey Theo

367
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:24,560
What was that...

368
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:29,540
Skunk ape stuff you and Professor were talking about when i went into the lab

369
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,800
[Theo] Swamp apes
[Troy] Swamp apes

370
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:35,320
[Theo] That's what they call technically because they are not related to skunks

371
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:39,400
They have this horrible stench

372
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:42,520
You can always smell them because you see them

373
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,420
[Troy] Have you ever seen one?

374
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:48,640
[Theo] yeah

375
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:51,160
Once when i was six

376
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,120
Just once

377
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:56,080
[Carl] Seriously?

378
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:57,800
[Theo] Oh yeah.

379
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:02,280
[Theo] It was at my house in the suburbs

380
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,020
just about a mile from here

381
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,620
Me and friend were playing in the backyard close to the woods

382
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:14,480
We looked up and there it was

383
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,600
staring right at us

384
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,960
Just a few yards away

385
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:24,380
It looked like this huge

386
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,120
Orangutan on two feet

387
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:29,260
With his piercing eyes

388
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:34,380
Then we heard this horrible crying sound come from the woods

389
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,220
And boom, took off, Gone!

390
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:40,260
Never saw it again

391
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:43,300
Told our parents
ofcourse nobody believed us

392
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:50,320
[Wendy] Thanks Theo.
Now i won't be able to sleep tonight

393
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:53,380
[Theo] I will tell you what

394
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,780
Sometimes..when i am out here in the woods alone

395
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,280
[Theo] Rubbing one out

396
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:04,380
i could still see it's eyes

397
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:06,660
Looking at me through the trees

398
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,180

Now look what happened
[Troy] It wasn't our fault we..

768
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:54,060
[Chief] Of course it was your fault

00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:09,960
Your society is doing the same thing to the
Esti Capcaki species

777
00:55:24,420 --> 00:55:26,740
[Troy] Is he.. Is he still alive?

778
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:30,500
[Chief] He's only knocked out
You are in no danger now anyway

779
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:34,980
The blood moon is over.
This was his time to find a mate.

780
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,440
and be free

781
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:44,540

782
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:50,280
