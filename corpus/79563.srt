1
00:00:54,687 --> 00:00:56,086
( narrator) Once upon a time,

2
00:00:56,156 --> 00:00:59,250
there was a young Thumb Thumb
named Juni.

3
00:00:59,325 --> 00:01:02,624
Juni was shy and had no self-confidence,

4
00:01:02,695 --> 00:01:08,395
until one day evil Thumb Thumbs
kidnapped his spy Thumb Thumb parents.

5
00:01:08,468 --> 00:01:12,734
it was up to Juni and his sister, Carmen,
to save Mom and Dad.

6
00:01:12,806 --> 00:01:15,434
And save them they did.

7
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:20,607
Juni became a hero,
the best Thumb Thumb agent ever seen.

8
00:01:21,514 --> 00:01:24,847
But one day Juni was betrayed.

9
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:28,183
He could not forgive the Thumb Thumbs
for using him.

10
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:32,520
So he left Thumb Village,
vowing never to return.

11
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:36,289
No one ever really
saw much of Juni after that.

12
00:01:36,362 --> 00:01:39,991
No one lived happily ever after.

13
00:01:40,066 --> 00:01:41,727
The end.

14
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:47,767
Wasn't that a marvelous story, children?

15
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:54,744
Today's feature presentation
will also be in three dimensions,

16
00:01:54,814 --> 00:01:58,079
But for now, take off your glasses,

17
00:01:58,151 --> 00:02:00,051
You won't need them for about,,,

18
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,985
ooh, 1 5 minutes or so,

19
00:02:02,055 --> 00:02:03,283
At that point,

20
00:02:03,356 --> 00:02:06,416
the movie becomes 3-D!

21
00:02:06,493 --> 00:02:09,587
Don't worry, You'll know
when to put your glasses on,

22
00:02:09,662 --> 00:02:14,224
When one of the main characters
puts his on, you do the same,

23
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:18,498
Now, if your eyes get tired
during the 3-D section of the movie,

24
00:02:18,571 --> 00:02:21,062
take off your glasses,
rush out to the concession stand,

25
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,200
purchase an extra large popcorn,
an extra large soda,

26
00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:25,403
come back to your seat,
put your glasses back on and voilà!

27
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:27,776
You just spent $35!

28
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:31,345
Keep those glasses off until it's time,

29
00:02:31,417 --> 00:02:33,476
And enjoy the show!

30
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:40,323
( ! slow jazz)

31
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:48,531
( Juni) Agua, as in water.

32
00:02:48,601 --> 00:02:51,468
Cute. But i wasn't here for cute.

33
00:02:52,438 --> 00:02:57,171
i was here 'cause i'd gotten
a call for my regular fee.

34
00:02:57,744 --> 00:03:01,043
$ 4.99.

35
00:03:01,114 --> 00:03:03,514
i'm an ex-secret agent.

36
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:06,643
My name is Juni Cortez.

37
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:09,210
And i'm a private detective.

38
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:12,315
A P.i.
A private eye.

39
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:14,787
A gumshoe.

40
00:03:19,098 --> 00:03:22,864
l know why the water
from your park is missing,

41
00:03:22,936 --> 00:03:25,564
- Pray tell,
- lt's winter,

42
00:03:25,638 --> 00:03:28,698
They shut down the park
during the winter,

43
00:03:28,775 --> 00:03:30,743
Who's ''they''?

44
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:34,837
The people who really own this park,

45
00:03:36,783 --> 00:03:38,341
Times are tough.

46
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:41,080
But a guy's gotta do what he's gotta do.

47
00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:43,486
From saving cats in trees...

48
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:45,023
( meows)

49
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:48,890
...to finding lost toys,

50
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:55,158
to helping people...
Hold on.

51
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:56,224
Yeah?

52
00:03:57,103 --> 00:03:59,264
The OSS is looking for me?

53
00:03:59,339 --> 00:04:02,866
Look, l'm no longer an agent,
l can't help you,

54
00:04:02,942 --> 00:04:05,342
Whatever it is, it's your problem,

55
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:08,005
Leave me alone!

56
00:04:08,948 --> 00:04:13,351
i'd been burned by the agency.
The OSS.

57
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:16,980
So i left.
No going back.

58
00:04:17,056 --> 00:04:19,854
i handle my own assignments now.

59
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:21,791
Smaller in scale.

60
00:04:22,195 --> 00:04:25,028
i was saving up for something big.

61
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,326
i was standing in line

62
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:30,392
to buy my copy of the biggest
virtual-reality game in history.

63
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:35,339
it goes online at midnight.
Pretty exciting, i suppose.

64
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:36,875
( man) Game Over.

65
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:39,673
The biggest video game
to ever be created, period.

66
00:04:39,746 --> 00:04:41,338
This is a worldwide event.

67
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:45,111
The game was created by someone
known only as the Toymaker,

68
00:04:45,184 --> 00:04:48,483
who was once again
unavailable for interviews.

69
00:04:51,424 --> 00:04:56,487
( Juni) But there's gotta be some things
more important than games.

70
00:05:00,533 --> 00:05:03,627
( man) Oh, and did we mention
the surprises the Toymaker has in store

71
00:05:03,703 --> 00:05:07,571
for those of you that complete level five?

72
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:14,068
Untold riches, toys, and prizes
beyond your wildest dreams.

73
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:16,513
Hey, no cutting in line, freak,

74
00:05:16,582 --> 00:05:19,050
l wasn't cutting,
l was standing right here!

75
00:05:19,118 --> 00:05:20,847
End of the line!

76
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:23,689
Needless to say,

77
00:05:23,756 --> 00:05:26,953
things have been pretty lame
since i left the OSS.

78
00:05:28,294 --> 00:05:29,283
Aah!

79
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:30,954
( laughter)

80
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:33,590
Things were about to get worse.

81
00:05:44,777 --> 00:05:45,869
( Romero) Dear Juni,

82
00:05:45,945 --> 00:05:48,971
i was doing some work
and thought you might like these.

83
00:05:49,048 --> 00:05:51,676
Miniaturized sharks.

84
00:05:51,751 --> 00:05:56,415
Remember, they're still man-eaters, so
don't be poking your fingers in the bowl.

85
00:05:56,489 --> 00:06:00,721
Take care. if you guys
ever need anything, i'll be there.

86
00:06:00,793 --> 00:06:01,691
Romero.

87
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:05,322
Ralph, write a thank-you note
back to Romero,

88
00:06:16,676 --> 00:06:19,270
Behave, you guys,
No fighting,

89
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:21,810
( shrieking)

90
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,081
( whirring)

91
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:32,783
- Whatcha doin'?
- Hi, Gerti,

92
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:36,295
l'm just doing nothing,,, again,

93
00:06:36,362 --> 00:06:38,830
- What's that?
- Mexican chocolate,

94
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:43,629
- Where's your mom and dad?
- On an assignment,

95
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:46,934
lt was my idea not to be
part of the family business,

96
00:06:47,006 --> 00:06:50,032
They're all on missions,
Your sister, too, huh?

97
00:06:50,109 --> 00:06:54,102
l haven't seen Carmen
since Christmas,,, last year,

98
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:57,013
You should join back up,
The OSS could really use you,

99
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,847
- Yeah, Use me,
- Not what l meant,

100
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,387
Don't hold on to the past, Juni,
Look at me,

101
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:04,423
9 years old and nowhere to go but up,

102
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:09,120
The only tribe worth belonging to
is the one that you're born into,

103
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:12,130
Yeah, your family,
lt's good to take care of your family,

104
00:07:12,198 --> 00:07:14,393
But remember one thing,

105
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:16,799
Everyone's your family,

106
00:07:18,037 --> 00:07:20,767
That makes no sense,

107
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:27,036
Hello, Juni,

108
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:28,671
Mr, President,

109
00:07:28,748 --> 00:07:30,545
Oh, you can call me Devlin,

110
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:34,211
Weren't you already running the country
when you were head of the OSS?

111
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:35,515
l was running the country,

112
00:07:35,588 --> 00:07:39,684
But since the OSS is a secret
organization, no one knew it,

113
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,159
l wanted the world to know
that l was in charge,

114
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:44,696
So l became president
of the United States,

115
00:07:44,764 --> 00:07:47,358
lt all depends upon your preference,

116
00:07:47,433 --> 00:07:50,197
Reality or perception,
Perception works for me,

117
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:52,601
Well, l'm into reality,

118
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:55,232
And the reality is, nothing you can say

119
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:59,608
will make me rejoin the OSS,
That is why you called, isn't it?

120
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:01,704
The OSS needs you to return,

121
00:08:01,781 --> 00:08:03,214
l'm retired,

122
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:05,477
Well, who's living in perception now?

123
00:08:05,551 --> 00:08:07,781
The fact is there is no retirement,

124
00:08:07,854 --> 00:08:09,446
Once an agent, always an agent,

125
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:11,922
lt's time for you to be a big boy
and reinstate,

126
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:15,449
With all due respect, sir, no,

127
00:08:15,528 --> 00:08:19,430
Then hold on to your seat,
because here's the reality:

128
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,694
Your sister's missing,

129
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:33,907
Taking Agent Cortez
to Games and Theory,

130
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:36,813
That's ex-Agent Cortez,

131
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:42,286
( Donnagon) You know,
that one's defective,

132
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:45,347
Something's wrong with the shape,

133
00:08:45,424 --> 00:08:47,585
See if we can take that one back,

134
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,192
Oh, man,

135
00:08:53,266 --> 00:08:54,494
We're on,

136
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:55,932
We're on!

137
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,339
Hello, Juni,

138
00:09:02,408 --> 00:09:05,206
Donnagon, Been a good boy lately?

139
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:06,506
Yes,

140
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:08,513
Very, very good,

141
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:11,482
Mrs, Giggles must have
straightened you out,

142
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:16,021
- l certainly did,
- Hello, Francesca,

143
00:09:16,088 --> 00:09:19,251
Yeah, she worked me over
pretty good, actually,

144
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:21,953
- Aah,
- Darling, behave,

145
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:25,327
What do you know about
a video game called Game Over?

146
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:29,300
l know that just about every kid
in the world is gonna sign on and play it,

147
00:09:29,368 --> 00:09:32,462
Not if we can help it,
The game is a trap,

148
00:09:32,538 --> 00:09:34,836
Once plugged into the game,

149
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:38,365
parents won't even be able to
get their children's attention,

150
00:09:38,444 --> 00:09:39,809
What else is new?

151
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:40,971
This is different,

152
00:09:41,047 --> 00:09:44,983
Once you get through the game,
your mind belongs to the Toymaker,

153
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:46,484
The inventor of the game,

154
00:09:46,552 --> 00:09:49,988
He wants to enslave
the world's youth with mind control,

155
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:54,493
You control the youth,
you control the future of the world,

156
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,654
She's an ingenious hacker, your sister,

157
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:00,255
We sent her inside to shut down the game,

158
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:04,360
But,,, she disappeared,

159
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,962
How can she disappear inside a game?

160
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:08,700
She didn't physically,

161
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:11,368
Actually, she's right here in the building,

162
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:15,376
Carmen! Carmen!

163
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:19,077
She can't hear you,
Her mind's still in the game,

164
00:10:19,151 --> 00:10:22,882
She got as far as level four, then nothing,

165
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:25,924
Why would she even go in there
without any backup?

166
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:30,656
Because her first and only choice
wouldn't answer our calls,

167
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:33,722
So she decided to go alone,

168
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:37,326
Now, you go in,
Find your sister,

169
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:40,270
Help her shut down the game in 1 2 hours,

170
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:42,967
or it's game over for everyone,

171
00:10:43,909 --> 00:10:46,002
Are you with us?

172
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:48,135
OK,

173
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:49,647
Then let's go,

174
00:10:51,951 --> 00:10:55,409
So l have to shut down the game
but not release the Toymaker?

175
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:58,548
Exactly, lt would be catastrophic
if he escaped,

176
00:10:58,624 --> 00:11:02,583
The Toymaker hates us for imprisoning
him in cyberspace all these years,

177
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:05,688
- What made you do that?
- Who knows? lt was years ago,

178
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:09,030
Now, you'll have to start
on level one like everyone else,

179
00:11:09,101 --> 00:11:12,764
Find your sister on level four,
Then proceed to level five,

180
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:15,534
- Which is unwinnable,
- Level five is unwinnable?

181
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:17,701
Level five is where
you shut down the game,

182
00:11:17,777 --> 00:11:19,404
lf the game is not shut down,

183
00:11:19,478 --> 00:11:24,142
you'll stay trapped with everyone else
when the Toymaker takes over the world,

184
00:11:26,452 --> 00:11:28,010
Put on these glasses,

185
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:31,682
and you'll enter the world of the game,

186
00:11:34,927 --> 00:11:37,953
You're being sent into a zero-gravity
chamber alongside Carmen,

187
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,021
That should give you a competitive edge,

188
00:11:40,099 --> 00:11:42,397
When you're in the game,
things will feel real,

189
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:43,526
Are they real?

190
00:11:43,602 --> 00:11:46,070
Good luck, Juni,

191
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:49,065
( Donnagon) Find Carmen,
Shut down the game,

192
00:11:49,141 --> 00:11:53,202
And whatever you do,
don't let the Toymaker out,

193
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:10,651
Ugh!

194
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,289
( beeping)

195
00:12:16,368 --> 00:12:18,768
Computer-generated,

196
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:25,074
Low-res!

197
00:12:26,979 --> 00:12:29,539
( thinking) Carmen.
Carmen, can you hear me?

198
00:12:29,615 --> 00:12:32,311
it's Juni, your brother.

199
00:12:32,384 --> 00:12:33,715
( croaking)

200
00:12:33,786 --> 00:12:35,447
Ugh!

201
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:40,417
Pogo Toads!

202
00:12:57,176 --> 00:12:59,736
Ugh! Ugh!

203
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:03,510
( grunting)

204
00:13:09,054 --> 00:13:10,043
Aah!

205
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:12,479
Ugh!

206
00:13:30,776 --> 00:13:32,334
Ha!

207
00:13:35,881 --> 00:13:36,870
Ugh!

208
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:40,881
Hey! Get your own ride, creepo!

209
00:13:40,953 --> 00:13:44,411
Sorry!
l thought you were a toad,

210
00:13:45,724 --> 00:13:47,055
New player, huh?

211
00:13:47,126 --> 00:13:49,094
Yeah, ( grunts)
New player,

212
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:52,562
Well, here's a lesson you won't soon forget,

213
00:13:57,636 --> 00:13:58,796
( moaning)

214
00:13:59,638 --> 00:14:01,731
Aah!

215
00:14:03,809 --> 00:14:05,470
How is he?

216
00:14:05,544 --> 00:14:07,478
His brain waves are normal,

217
00:14:07,546 --> 00:14:09,138
But how is he?

218
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:11,945
Oh, He fell,

219
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,551
( grunts)

220
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:27,625
Stand up.

221
00:14:30,903 --> 00:14:32,768
You fell three stories.

222
00:14:32,838 --> 00:14:34,965
Aah, l survived?

223
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,601
Not exactly.
That is your life count.

224
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:43,272
After taking heavy damage, you lose a life.

225
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:45,180
What happens when l hit zero?

226
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:47,219
Game over.

227
00:14:47,286 --> 00:14:52,622
When you run out of life, you lose.
No replays. No restarts.

228
00:14:52,691 --> 00:14:54,124
( beeping)

229
00:14:54,193 --> 00:14:57,959
What happened to my 1 2 hours?
l only have four now,

230
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:00,931
Time flies when you're playing games.

231
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,627
This is crazy,

232
00:15:02,701 --> 00:15:04,430
Better hurry.

233
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:17,913
Ugh!

234
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,077
Aah!

235
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:26,287
( breathing heavily)

236
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:28,949
So who are you?

237
00:15:29,028 --> 00:15:32,520
l'm Juni Cortez,
ex-secret agent of the OSS,

238
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:34,862
l need to get to level five,

239
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:38,927
But l only have a few hours before
the Toymaker takes over the world,

240
00:15:39,004 --> 00:15:42,235
- Level five?
- Level five is unwinnable,

241
00:15:42,308 --> 00:15:44,503
l understand that,
But l have to save the world,

242
00:15:44,576 --> 00:15:48,478
Rez, this person thinks
he's level-five material,

243
00:15:48,547 --> 00:15:50,276
So l hear,

244
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:54,718
You guys must be beta testers,

245
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:59,247
One of the first allowed to roam free
these coveted digital hills, my friend,

246
00:15:59,325 --> 00:16:01,725
How can l offer service?

247
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,921
l'm Rez,

248
00:16:06,565 --> 00:16:08,965
Hi, Rez,
Now, about saving the world,

249
00:16:09,034 --> 00:16:11,628
lf anyone's gonna get
to the great prize at level five,

250
00:16:11,704 --> 00:16:12,966
it's gonna be one of us,

251
00:16:13,038 --> 00:16:15,063
Whatever,
l want cheat codes,

252
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:18,735
Back-door entrances,
Shortcuts, Anything,

253
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:21,302
l can pay you with bonus packs,

254
00:16:22,247 --> 00:16:25,148
lmplementation of any form
of hack code or cheat boost

255
00:16:25,217 --> 00:16:26,912
will trigger an immediate game over

256
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,851
and permanent evac from the game,

257
00:16:28,921 --> 00:16:30,115
lt's in your tech manual,

258
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:33,420
You have to play the game by the rules

259
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:35,050
or not at all,

260
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:36,424
All right,

261
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:39,726
How do l get to level two
as quickly as possible?

262
00:16:39,798 --> 00:16:42,323
Lives are at stake, Please,

263
00:16:42,401 --> 00:16:45,268
See that target? Hit it,

264
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:46,964
You'll bounce straight to the moon,

265
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:49,701
Yeah, l'd suggest a running start,

266
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:52,005
Level two is on the dark side
of the moon,

267
00:16:52,077 --> 00:16:55,911
The way to get there is by hitting
that target and bouncing to it,

268
00:16:55,981 --> 00:17:00,509
Not a lot of realism
in these games, is there?

269
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:08,421
Won't be seeing him anymore,
Let's go,

270
00:17:08,494 --> 00:17:09,552
Less competition, the better,

271
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:11,926
Aah!

272
00:17:11,997 --> 00:17:14,056
Aah! Ugh!

273
00:17:16,668 --> 00:17:18,329
Wow!

274
00:17:19,805 --> 00:17:21,830
Aah!

275
00:17:28,013 --> 00:17:31,210
( coughs/grunts)

276
00:17:38,857 --> 00:17:41,348
Oh, great,

277
00:17:45,264 --> 00:17:49,200
A message from the OSS.
Do you accept?

278
00:17:50,135 --> 00:17:51,796
Mm-hm,

279
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:56,602
OK, Juni, we can no longer be
of assistance,

280
00:17:56,675 --> 00:17:57,767
What assistance?

281
00:17:57,843 --> 00:17:59,868
You do get one additional lifeline,

282
00:17:59,945 --> 00:18:01,947
which you can choose to use now
or later,

283
00:18:01,947 --> 00:18:03,209
Now!
Give it to me now,

284
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:06,342
You get to bring in
any one person from the outside

285
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:07,851
to help you on your journey,

286
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,547
Call up the family files,

287
00:18:10,189 --> 00:18:12,089
( man) Assertive. Athletic.
Knows karate.

288
00:18:12,157 --> 00:18:13,124
intelligent.

289
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:14,523
Strategic.

290
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:15,617
Knows karate.

291
00:18:15,694 --> 00:18:18,629
Wait a minute,
Go back to Grandpa,

292
00:18:18,697 --> 00:18:21,063
( man) Pros. superior intellect.

293
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:23,465
( man) Cons. physically disabled.

294
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:26,527
He's been paralyzed
from the waist down for 30 years,

295
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:28,835
His energy force would have
doubled back again,

296
00:18:28,907 --> 00:18:33,367
making his arms, his heart, his brain
twice as strong as a normal person,

297
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:36,539
- What are you thinking, sir?
- l choose Grandpa,

298
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:39,083
Selected. One moment.

299
00:18:45,023 --> 00:18:47,014
That was fast, Sort of,

300
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:49,558
Grandpa!

301
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:51,459
Juni!

302
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:52,792
Where am l?

303
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:57,063
ln a video game run by a madman
called the Toymaker,

304
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,297
The Toymaker is here?

305
00:18:59,371 --> 00:19:00,599
You know him?

306
00:19:01,206 --> 00:19:05,165
l've been hunting him down
for 30 years, Juni,

307
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:09,975
- You shouldn't have brought me here,
- l needed your help,

308
00:19:10,048 --> 00:19:13,484
We have to find Carmen
and shut down the game,

309
00:19:14,286 --> 00:19:15,947
What is that?

310
00:19:16,922 --> 00:19:19,948
lt's a power-up of some kind,

311
00:19:21,426 --> 00:19:22,916
Mega Legs,

312
00:19:23,896 --> 00:19:25,887
Give it to me,

313
00:19:36,475 --> 00:19:38,443
Grandpa?

314
00:19:43,315 --> 00:19:45,442
You can walk,

315
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:48,179
No, Juni,

316
00:19:56,228 --> 00:19:59,288
Oh, l can do more than that,

317
00:20:00,098 --> 00:20:01,497
Wow,

318
00:20:09,141 --> 00:20:10,938
Hmm,

319
00:20:11,009 --> 00:20:12,670
Grandpa?

320
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:15,708
Hmm,

321
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,784
Where are you going?

322
00:20:20,852 --> 00:20:24,652
Don't wait for me, Juni,
l'll catch up with you,

323
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:26,452
But we have to find,,,

324
00:20:27,426 --> 00:20:29,053
Carmen,

325
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:35,958
Valentin, my old friend,

326
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:40,694
You think you'll catch me
this time, don't you?

327
00:20:40,772 --> 00:20:42,763
Well,,,

328
00:20:44,543 --> 00:20:47,034
you will,

329
00:20:47,112 --> 00:20:50,843
Oh, you will,

330
00:20:56,622 --> 00:20:59,591
Everything falls into place,

331
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:05,294
Everything falls,

332
00:21:12,137 --> 00:21:14,128
( crowd cheering)

333
00:21:20,979 --> 00:21:23,812
( electricity crackling)

334
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:33,087
( cheering continues)

335
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:41,099
Wow,

336
00:21:42,701 --> 00:21:45,761
A courageous new contestant,
Welcome to the Robocon,

337
00:21:45,837 --> 00:21:46,997
l need to get to level two,

338
00:21:47,072 --> 00:21:48,972
Well, you came to the wrong place,

339
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:50,702
This is the Arena of Misfortune,

340
00:21:50,776 --> 00:21:53,267
To get to level two, you're gonna
have to battle a Mech,

341
00:21:53,345 --> 00:21:54,369
How do l do that?

342
00:21:54,446 --> 00:21:56,971
l'll explain it to you
when you get up there,

343
00:22:03,855 --> 00:22:05,345
Hey, there,

344
00:22:05,424 --> 00:22:09,724
Just go out there
in your Battle Mech and fight,

345
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:19,835
Wait a minute,
Who am l fighting?

346
00:22:19,905 --> 00:22:21,566
Her,

347
00:22:27,946 --> 00:22:31,973
Don't get too trashed
and l win bonus points,

348
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:34,109
( whirring)

349
00:22:41,593 --> 00:22:43,083
( crowd cheering)

350
00:22:45,931 --> 00:22:47,956
Right foot, left foot,

351
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:50,331
Right foot, Oh!

352
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:54,303
Oh! How do you work this thing?

353
00:23:04,116 --> 00:23:05,447
Ooh,

354
00:23:07,786 --> 00:23:10,050
- Ooh,
- ( bell dings)

355
00:23:10,122 --> 00:23:12,386
OK, i want a good, clean robo fight.

356
00:23:12,457 --> 00:23:16,791
There will be no kidney punches,
no rabbit punches,

357
00:23:16,862 --> 00:23:19,126
no eye gouging or ear biting.

358
00:23:19,197 --> 00:23:22,564
Unless, of course, you can't help yourself.

359
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:25,593
Hi,

360
00:23:27,172 --> 00:23:28,469
l'm Juni,

361
00:23:30,442 --> 00:23:32,205
Oh, l'm sorry,

362
00:23:32,277 --> 00:23:33,710
l'm sorry, He didn't mean it,

363
00:23:33,779 --> 00:23:35,178
Really, really,

364
00:23:36,615 --> 00:23:38,480
No, No, no, no!

365
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:40,643
Please, no!

366
00:23:43,488 --> 00:23:44,477
Oh!

367
00:23:46,158 --> 00:23:47,625
Ugh!

368
00:23:50,629 --> 00:23:52,893
( knuckles cracking)

369
00:23:52,964 --> 00:23:55,091
( grunting)

370
00:24:05,677 --> 00:24:08,942
Hi, l'm Demetra,

371
00:24:19,224 --> 00:24:21,055
( crowd cheering)

372
00:24:50,589 --> 00:24:52,580
( screaming)

373
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:00,691
Aah!

374
00:25:02,634 --> 00:25:05,398
( crowd groans)

375
00:25:08,139 --> 00:25:09,868
Help,

376
00:25:18,483 --> 00:25:20,815
( crowd boos)

377
00:25:30,262 --> 00:25:33,322
Oh! That's gotta hurt,

378
00:26:33,792 --> 00:26:36,090
( crowd cheers)

379
00:26:39,798 --> 00:26:42,062
l'm the winner!

380
00:26:42,133 --> 00:26:43,259
Yeah!

381
00:26:43,335 --> 00:26:45,269
Whoo! Yes!

382
00:26:45,337 --> 00:26:47,305
Well, well, well,

383
00:26:47,372 --> 00:26:50,364
For a kid that doesn't know how to fight,

384
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:52,672
you sure know how to fight,

385
00:26:52,744 --> 00:26:56,271
Congratulations,
And keep the suit,

386
00:26:57,882 --> 00:26:59,349
Hey! Hey!

387
00:26:59,851 --> 00:27:01,819
Hey!

388
00:27:01,886 --> 00:27:02,614
( crowd cheering)

389
00:27:04,522 --> 00:27:07,082
So, let's go over this again, shall we?

390
00:27:07,158 --> 00:27:09,956
So there's no mistake,
So there's no gross error,

391
00:27:10,028 --> 00:27:13,395
So there's no lack
of communication amongst us,

392
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:16,400
What l want, what we want,,,

393
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:18,402
What do we want?

394
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:22,770
Our time on this planet is over,
lt belongs now to our youth,

395
00:27:22,841 --> 00:27:25,435
Not if we control their minds!

396
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:29,071
We could start the world over again
and cure it of its diseases,

397
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:31,809
We could begin anew,

398
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:41,889
Forget what we could do!
lt's what we should do!

399
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:45,862
Am l doing the right thing?

400
00:27:46,431 --> 00:27:50,128
lt's not about the right thing,
lt's about the smart thing,

401
00:27:50,201 --> 00:27:50,963
Ah,

402
00:27:51,036 --> 00:27:53,834
We won't escape this place otherwise,

403
00:27:53,905 --> 00:27:57,864
l speak for all of us
when l say, ''We want out!''

404
00:27:57,942 --> 00:27:59,239
Hmm,

405
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:01,505
The end justifies the means,

406
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:03,776
You have the children's attention,

407
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:07,147
The question is,
what are you teaching them?

408
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:09,884
Who are you people?

409
00:28:10,922 --> 00:28:12,583
We are you,

410
00:28:13,758 --> 00:28:15,658
Forgive me, Forgive me,

411
00:28:15,727 --> 00:28:19,060
l forget the extent of my
programming powers from time to time,

412
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:24,762
For a moment, l actually
believed that you existed,

413
00:28:24,836 --> 00:28:26,201
( chuckles)

414
00:28:27,305 --> 00:28:28,704
Goodbye,

415
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:31,372
Out, out, out,

416
00:28:31,443 --> 00:28:32,842
Out, out,

417
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:37,678
This childish game will soon be over,

418
00:28:37,749 --> 00:28:41,515
And then the real game will begin,

419
00:28:42,287 --> 00:28:43,777
( inhales deeply)

420
00:28:44,823 --> 00:28:46,415
Hmm,

421
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,835
Will you look at this?

422
00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:12,314
Hold on to your joysticks, boys,
l think we got him,

423
00:29:15,453 --> 00:29:16,750
You're the Guy,

424
00:29:16,821 --> 00:29:17,913
l'm the who?

425
00:29:17,989 --> 00:29:21,117
The Guy,
The guy from the poster,

426
00:29:21,192 --> 00:29:22,853
That guy,

427
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:26,724
No, Wait a minute,

428
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:30,734
l'm only looking for my sister,
She's somewhere on level four,

429
00:29:30,802 --> 00:29:33,999
Then l'm heading out through level five,

430
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:37,040
So you can win the game?

431
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:39,076
l guess that's one way of putting it,

432
00:29:39,144 --> 00:29:42,705
You see, according to the tech manual,

433
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:45,545
if we find the Guy,,,

434
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:47,278
the Guy,,,

435
00:29:47,352 --> 00:29:49,616
he'll lead us through the unwinnable level,

436
00:29:49,687 --> 00:29:52,087
Just 'cause he made it
out of Robocon in one piece

437
00:29:52,157 --> 00:29:53,522
doesn't mean he's the Guy,

438
00:29:53,591 --> 00:29:56,651
He's the first l've seen
to make it out with the power suit,

439
00:29:56,728 --> 00:30:00,459
Man, give me a break,
This wimp's a phony,

440
00:30:01,533 --> 00:30:03,763
There's only one way to find out,

441
00:30:04,903 --> 00:30:07,133
Mega Race,

442
00:30:07,205 --> 00:30:10,834
The fastest, most dangerous race
in the game world,

443
00:30:10,909 --> 00:30:12,137
- Come on,
- No, Wait,

444
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:13,336
l already told you l'm not the Guy,

445
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:15,275
- Go,
- OK,

446
00:30:18,416 --> 00:30:20,611
( Toymaker) The race will begin shortly.

447
00:30:20,685 --> 00:30:22,983
Claim your vehicle.

448
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:28,990
( engines buzzing)

449
00:30:31,896 --> 00:30:33,693
You got to be kidding,

450
00:30:33,765 --> 00:30:35,733
This race will tell us if you're the Guy,

451
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,893
lf you are, you can hang with us,

452
00:30:37,969 --> 00:30:41,700
But if you're a phony, Arnold will crush you,

453
00:30:41,773 --> 00:30:43,764
Aah!

454
00:30:44,809 --> 00:30:46,504
l'm not the Guy,

455
00:30:46,578 --> 00:30:49,046
How many times do l have to say it?

456
00:30:49,113 --> 00:30:51,445
( Toymaker) There are
no rules in this race,

457
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:54,974
except win at any cost.

458
00:30:55,053 --> 00:30:56,384
( engines revving)

459
00:30:56,454 --> 00:30:57,853
All right!

460
00:31:08,233 --> 00:31:10,326
( engine revs)

461
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:29,377
We'll try to help you out,,,
as much as we can,

462
00:31:29,854 --> 00:31:32,652
( Toymaker) The race will begin... now.

463
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:33,884
One, two, three, go!

464
00:31:33,958 --> 00:31:35,823
( grunts)

465
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:51,933
Hmm?

466
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:03,880
- Easy as pie,
- Juni, push the red button,

467
00:32:03,955 --> 00:32:06,753
The one that says ''Do not push''?

468
00:32:06,824 --> 00:32:09,156
Yeah, Push it,
lt's a turbo boost,

469
00:32:09,227 --> 00:32:11,388
- Are you sure?
- Yeah,

470
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:13,927
( grunts)

471
00:32:17,635 --> 00:32:19,660
( grunting)

472
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,373
Aah!

473
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:27,267
Hey, Rez, give me a hand!

474
00:32:27,345 --> 00:32:28,869
Hey, how about a foot?

475
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:30,437
Aah! Aah!

476
00:32:31,849 --> 00:32:33,407
Whoa!

477
00:32:40,992 --> 00:32:42,983
Whoa!

478
00:32:43,061 --> 00:32:44,995
( grunts)

479
00:32:45,063 --> 00:32:47,463
My turn, sucker, ( chuckles)

480
00:32:47,532 --> 00:32:49,022
Aah!

481
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:55,470
You're supposed to be
winning the race, Juni,

482
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:57,269
Grandpa!

483
00:33:16,194 --> 00:33:18,355
( grunting)

484
00:33:22,633 --> 00:33:24,999
What is this?

485
00:33:32,944 --> 00:33:34,377
Whoa!

486
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:57,397
Ugh!

487
00:33:57,468 --> 00:33:58,526
Ugh!

488
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:00,534
Nngh!

489
00:34:01,572 --> 00:34:03,005
Oh!

490
00:34:03,074 --> 00:34:04,507
The glove!

491
00:34:04,575 --> 00:34:06,475
Grab the glove,

492
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:08,478
The glove!

493
00:34:09,447 --> 00:34:10,641
Ugh!

494
00:34:14,819 --> 00:34:16,184
Whoa!

495
00:34:16,421 --> 00:34:17,854
Whoa!

496
00:34:23,628 --> 00:34:25,118
Whoa!

497
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:55,456
Ugh!

498
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,730
( tire screeching)

499
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:11,704
Whoa,

500
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:19,439
Uh-oh,

501
00:35:31,896 --> 00:35:33,090
Aah!

502
00:35:33,164 --> 00:35:35,962
Grab another bike, Juni!

503
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:45,371
( Toymaker) Final stretch!

504
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:59,388
( grunting)

505
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:16,834
( Toymaker) Five... four...

506
00:36:16,908 --> 00:36:19,342
three... two... one.

507
00:36:19,877 --> 00:36:25,247
Winner by a hubcap, Juni Cortez!

508
00:36:25,316 --> 00:36:28,012
( crowd cheers)

509
00:36:39,463 --> 00:36:42,432
- l thought you were him,
- l knew it,

510
00:36:44,802 --> 00:36:46,770
l guess you are,

511
00:36:55,012 --> 00:36:58,539
So, l hear you're the Guy,

512
00:36:58,616 --> 00:37:01,517
l am definitely the Guy,

513
00:37:01,586 --> 00:37:02,746
Yeah!

514
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:03,752
( cheering)

515
00:37:04,755 --> 00:37:05,813
Yeah!

516
00:37:06,023 --> 00:37:07,320
Yeah!

517
00:37:20,805 --> 00:37:25,139
- So now what, Guy?
- l have to go talk to my grandfather,

518
00:37:25,209 --> 00:37:26,938
To who?

519
00:37:27,011 --> 00:37:29,639
l mean l must confer

520
00:37:29,714 --> 00:37:35,050
with the Wizard of Atari-Sega-Nendo,

521
00:37:36,053 --> 00:37:39,113
Yeah, OK, cool,

522
00:37:43,961 --> 00:37:47,761
Congratulations, You won the race,

523
00:37:47,832 --> 00:37:51,427
But now they think l'm some important guy
who's going to win for them,

524
00:37:51,502 --> 00:37:54,994
For our purposes, that's very good,

525
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:58,599
They can lead us to level four
more quickly,

526
00:37:58,676 --> 00:38:00,143
so you can find your sister,

527
00:38:00,211 --> 00:38:03,147
so we can shut down the game
and make things right,

528
00:38:03,147 --> 00:38:07,777
And so that l can find,,,

529
00:38:07,852 --> 00:38:09,979
the Toymaker,

530
00:38:10,054 --> 00:38:13,615
We're not supposed to
get near the Toymaker,

531
00:38:14,558 --> 00:38:18,392
So say the rules of the OSS,

532
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:20,623
which l'm not following,

533
00:38:20,698 --> 00:38:23,861
He might escape,
We can't risk that,

534
00:38:23,934 --> 00:38:26,562
Oh, no, Juni,

535
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:30,232
l don't plan on letting him go anywhere,

536
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:32,538
Guy!

537
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:34,874
We'll talk about this later,

538
00:38:35,546 --> 00:38:37,309
OK, Here it is,

539
00:38:37,381 --> 00:38:40,407
l'm not supposed to lead you to level five,

540
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:42,543
You're supposed to lead me there,

541
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:44,611
So you mean we work together?

542
00:38:44,689 --> 00:38:49,126
The wizard said if we all work together,
we all win,

543
00:38:49,193 --> 00:38:51,593
With my strength,

544
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:53,254
My brains,

545
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:55,390
My cool,

546
00:38:55,466 --> 00:38:57,832
My intuition,

547
00:38:58,602 --> 00:39:02,834
OK, So you're the Guy,
We're all counting on you,

548
00:39:02,907 --> 00:39:06,365
But if you fail us or if you're
not who you say you are,

549
00:39:06,444 --> 00:39:10,642
this life counter will hit zero
faster than you can say ''oops,''

550
00:39:10,715 --> 00:39:12,012
Deal,

551
00:39:12,083 --> 00:39:14,517
First l got to find my sister,

552
00:39:14,585 --> 00:39:17,145
So level four, people,

553
00:39:17,221 --> 00:39:19,155
Move!

554
00:39:27,231 --> 00:39:28,255
Come on, Grandpa,

555
00:39:28,332 --> 00:39:31,199
He's doing good, huh?
Huh?

556
00:39:31,268 --> 00:39:34,169
Yeah, he's doing great,
and that's the problem,

557
00:39:34,238 --> 00:39:35,170
Why?

558
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:37,605
( sighs) They've awoken the Programmerz,

559
00:39:37,675 --> 00:39:38,664
What?

560
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:42,102
- Pull him out of there now,
- Too late,

561
00:39:45,916 --> 00:39:48,510
( Juni) All right, This is cool,

562
00:39:48,586 --> 00:39:50,679
We'll get there in no time,

563
00:39:51,489 --> 00:39:53,650
( Francis) What is this?

564
00:39:57,561 --> 00:39:59,586
Wait a minute,

565
00:40:01,465 --> 00:40:02,932
The Programmerz,

566
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:07,363
Who are these Programmerz?

567
00:40:07,438 --> 00:40:09,565
The brainiacs who wrote
the book for the game,

568
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:14,236
So, they work for the Toymaker, huh?

569
00:40:14,311 --> 00:40:16,779
Programmerz are the reason
you found us on level one,

570
00:40:16,847 --> 00:40:19,281
They caught Francis cheating
during the Mega Race,

571
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:22,080
They'll bounce us back
to level one again if they catch us,

572
00:40:22,153 --> 00:40:24,986
Level one? l don't have time for that,

573
00:40:25,055 --> 00:40:26,784
( crashing)

574
00:40:26,857 --> 00:40:28,051
Spread out,

575
00:40:28,125 --> 00:40:30,252
Don't split up! lt never works!

576
00:40:30,327 --> 00:40:32,454
lf we just stick together,,,

577
00:40:33,531 --> 00:40:38,025
All right, Grandpa,
l guess it's just you and me,

578
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:39,763
Hello?

579
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:43,133
Grandpa?

580
00:40:51,248 --> 00:40:52,772
- Psst!
- Aah!

581
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:55,978
Can you at least try and act
like you're the Guy?

582
00:40:56,053 --> 00:40:58,044
You know my secret?

583
00:40:58,122 --> 00:41:01,455
l've seen the real Guy, and you're not him,

584
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:05,126
Why are Programmerz chasing us?

585
00:41:05,196 --> 00:41:06,891
Someone's got a game cheat,

586
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:08,056
What's this?

587
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:09,656
A map to the game,

588
00:41:09,733 --> 00:41:11,325
This is illegal,

589
00:41:11,402 --> 00:41:14,030
You want to find your sister or not?

590
00:41:15,072 --> 00:41:17,063
Give me the map,

591
00:41:18,676 --> 00:41:20,234
- OK,
- Wow,

592
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:21,710
We're in Machine City,

593
00:41:21,779 --> 00:41:24,714
lf we cut across here,
we'll be able to reach level four,

594
00:41:24,782 --> 00:41:26,306
Where Carmen is,

595
00:41:26,383 --> 00:41:27,407
Right,

596
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:30,386
Then, if we cut through Lava Mountain,

597
00:41:30,454 --> 00:41:32,922
we'll be right at the door
of the unwinnable level,

598
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:36,926
Shortcuts, This is good,
This is very good,

599
00:41:36,994 --> 00:41:39,519
Game cheats,

600
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:42,989
That's against the rules,

601
00:41:44,134 --> 00:41:49,504
We're gonna have to bounce you
back to level one,

602
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:52,407
- Aah!
- You can't scare us, He's the Guy,

603
00:41:52,476 --> 00:41:54,171
Grandpa!

604
00:41:54,245 --> 00:41:59,649
Listen to that, Edog,
The Guy is calling his grandpa,

605
00:42:00,251 --> 00:42:03,277
l'm so scared,
Come and get me, Gramps,

606
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:06,016
What's he gonna do, drool on us?

607
00:42:07,124 --> 00:42:09,922
Why are you picking on my grandson?

608
00:42:10,995 --> 00:42:12,019
Why?

609
00:42:13,297 --> 00:42:16,698
They got Logos and Edog, the leaders,

610
00:42:16,767 --> 00:42:19,031
You are Programmerz?

611
00:42:19,103 --> 00:42:22,163
Let's see what you really look like, huh?

612
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:28,241
Very unimpressive,

613
00:42:28,812 --> 00:42:30,712
Computer nerds,

614
00:42:30,781 --> 00:42:34,273
Now tell me, where is the Toymaker?

615
00:42:34,351 --> 00:42:38,048
Grandpa,,, uh, Wizard, put them down!

616
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:53,897
He's good,

617
00:42:53,971 --> 00:42:56,997
The boy warrior is very, very good,

618
00:42:57,074 --> 00:42:58,632
But he's got to keep going,

619
00:42:58,709 --> 00:43:00,574
We run the risk of discouraging him

620
00:43:00,644 --> 00:43:03,514
if the next levels are too challenging,

621
00:43:03,514 --> 00:43:05,345
But only by seeking challenges

622
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:08,647
can we hope to find the best in ourselves,

623
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:09,845
Can we help him?

624
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,115
No! lt's against the rules of the game!

625
00:43:12,189 --> 00:43:14,384
This isn't a game,

626
00:43:15,092 --> 00:43:17,492
lt's life!

627
00:43:19,196 --> 00:43:21,687
l don't mind talking to myself,

628
00:43:22,232 --> 00:43:25,360
But when you guys start to
cut me out of the conversation,

629
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:28,803
that's when it gets a little strange,

630
00:43:30,174 --> 00:43:33,143
That's it,
More life is what we need,

631
00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:38,079
We'll grant the boy a gift,
The gift of life,

632
00:43:44,951 --> 00:43:46,213
Don't worry, Guy,

633
00:43:46,286 --> 00:43:48,015
From here on out, l'll protect you,

634
00:43:48,088 --> 00:43:49,715
( grunts)

635
00:43:49,790 --> 00:43:51,314
Are you all right, Guy?

636
00:43:51,391 --> 00:43:54,485
Hey, He found a life pack,

637
00:43:54,561 --> 00:43:55,653
A what?

638
00:43:55,729 --> 00:43:56,991
That's rare,

639
00:43:57,064 --> 00:43:59,362
l've never seen one up close before,

640
00:43:59,433 --> 00:44:00,866
What do l do?

641
00:44:00,934 --> 00:44:04,597
Crush it in your hands,
You'll gain life,

642
00:44:06,206 --> 00:44:07,537
How much?

643
00:44:07,607 --> 00:44:09,575
All depends,

644
00:44:13,113 --> 00:44:15,206
l got extra life, Demetra,

645
00:44:15,282 --> 00:44:18,513
Congratulations,
You'll need it the most,

646
00:44:19,386 --> 00:44:21,513
l want you to take it,

647
00:44:22,289 --> 00:44:24,780
Juni, l can't,

648
00:44:33,066 --> 00:44:34,624
Does he know what that's worth?

649
00:44:34,701 --> 00:44:36,635
Of course he does,

650
00:44:38,438 --> 00:44:40,998
l owed you from the Robot Arena,

651
00:44:41,074 --> 00:44:45,841
Also, l don't want anything
to happen to you,

652
00:44:45,912 --> 00:44:47,436
Thank you,

653
00:44:51,885 --> 00:44:56,322
( Toymaker)
You have now entered level three.

654
00:45:03,263 --> 00:45:06,858
l wish my family
could see this amazing place,

655
00:45:06,933 --> 00:45:09,766
What are you doing in the game, Arnold?

656
00:45:20,881 --> 00:45:23,611
Well, actually, l got in
on a beta tester's visa,

657
00:45:23,683 --> 00:45:26,618
l'm here for the great prize
behind level five,

658
00:45:26,686 --> 00:45:28,745
lt'll save my family from poverty,

659
00:45:28,822 --> 00:45:30,790
But what waits for us in level five?

660
00:45:30,857 --> 00:45:33,849
l mean, is it all true?
Untold riches?

661
00:45:34,428 --> 00:45:36,828
Arnold, you should know

662
00:45:36,897 --> 00:45:39,195
that when we reach the end of the game--

663
00:45:39,266 --> 00:45:41,734
No, Don't tell me,

664
00:45:42,702 --> 00:45:45,136
l want it to be a surprise,

665
00:45:45,205 --> 00:45:46,672
- l'm sure it will be,
- ( bell chimes)

666
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:49,106
( Toymaker) Attention, gamers!

667
00:45:49,176 --> 00:45:51,144
Stand on the red line.

668
00:45:52,813 --> 00:45:55,805
Choose your best player.

669
00:45:56,583 --> 00:45:59,381
The Guy,
The Guy's the best,

670
00:46:00,153 --> 00:46:03,418
( Toymaker) Choose your strongest player.

671
00:46:03,490 --> 00:46:05,082
That'd be Arnold,

672
00:46:18,472 --> 00:46:21,100
( Toymaker) Survival of the fittest.

673
00:46:21,174 --> 00:46:23,642
Face your opponent.

674
00:46:25,879 --> 00:46:28,814
Wait a minute,
l'm not fighting Arnold,

675
00:46:28,882 --> 00:46:30,679
l don't want to crush Juni,

676
00:46:30,750 --> 00:46:33,776
( Toymaker) The winner shall proceed
with the others to level four.

677
00:46:33,854 --> 00:46:36,288
The loser shall be given
an immediate game over

678
00:46:36,356 --> 00:46:40,759
and will be evacuated
permanently from the game.

679
00:46:40,827 --> 00:46:43,489
Arnold, l have to save my sister,

680
00:46:43,563 --> 00:46:45,656
l'm sorry, Juni,

681
00:46:45,732 --> 00:46:48,462
But l have my own family to think about,

682
00:46:49,469 --> 00:46:51,596
l can't beat you, Arnold,

683
00:46:55,876 --> 00:46:57,173
l know,

684
00:46:57,777 --> 00:47:00,177
( Toymaker) Fight!

685
00:47:00,247 --> 00:47:02,715
( grunting)

686
00:47:09,956 --> 00:47:12,220
( grunting)

687
00:47:14,961 --> 00:47:16,622
Aah!

688
00:47:42,389 --> 00:47:44,619
Not that l'm rooting for anyone in particular,

689
00:47:44,691 --> 00:47:47,285
but that was a really cool move,

690
00:47:50,797 --> 00:47:52,162
Aah!

691
00:48:07,914 --> 00:48:09,643
Nice knowing you, Juni,

692
00:48:09,716 --> 00:48:11,081
Arnold, please!

693
00:48:12,052 --> 00:48:14,486
- Unh!
- ( whirring)

694
00:48:14,554 --> 00:48:17,387
( whirring slows, stops)

695
00:48:18,558 --> 00:48:20,116
What's going on?

696
00:48:20,193 --> 00:48:21,956
( Toymaker) You've been tagged.

697
00:48:22,028 --> 00:48:23,893
What do you mean, l've been tagged?

698
00:48:23,964 --> 00:48:27,024
Someone has switched places with you.

699
00:48:29,736 --> 00:48:30,828
Not me, Guy,

700
00:48:30,904 --> 00:48:32,166
( beeping)

701
00:48:33,173 --> 00:48:34,834
Demetra, what are you doing?

702
00:48:34,908 --> 00:48:38,002
You have to find your sister, Juni,

703
00:48:39,012 --> 00:48:40,377
Don't! Don't do it!

704
00:48:43,383 --> 00:48:44,714
Demetra, no!

705
00:48:44,784 --> 00:48:46,046
( Toymaker) Fight!

706
00:48:48,922 --> 00:48:51,015
- No!
- Aah!

707
00:48:54,361 --> 00:48:59,025
( Toymaker) Demetra, game over!

708
00:49:03,570 --> 00:49:08,269
l never even got her e-mail address,

709
00:49:11,711 --> 00:49:15,841
Don't fall in love with a game, Juni,

710
00:49:19,986 --> 00:49:22,580
Let's get out of here,

711
00:49:22,656 --> 00:49:24,521
Sorry, Juni,

712
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:27,556
My family,

713
00:49:33,633 --> 00:49:38,468
You are causing so much pain,

714
00:49:39,572 --> 00:49:42,666
And only l can stop you,

715
00:49:42,742 --> 00:49:46,234
For l know why you do these things,,,

716
00:49:46,946 --> 00:49:49,278
Toymaker,

717
00:49:50,250 --> 00:49:52,241
Bring it on,

718
00:49:53,253 --> 00:49:57,849
Find me, and the world
will truly pay the price,

719
00:49:58,925 --> 00:50:03,589
Here in my cyberprison
l was forced to create,

720
00:50:05,031 --> 00:50:08,558
Now l will destroy,

721
00:50:10,270 --> 00:50:13,433
Release the girl,
Put her back in the game,

722
00:50:14,774 --> 00:50:15,763
But, sir--

723
00:50:15,842 --> 00:50:17,969
Oh, you have a better solution, don't you?

724
00:50:18,044 --> 00:50:20,638
Of course you do, You all do,

725
00:50:20,714 --> 00:50:22,705
So tell me,
What is the real answer?

726
00:50:22,782 --> 00:50:25,216
- l'm so curious,
- Revenge,

727
00:50:25,285 --> 00:50:27,219
- Healing,
- Destruction!

728
00:50:27,287 --> 00:50:28,720
- Love,
- Hate,

729
00:50:28,788 --> 00:50:29,914
Uh-huh,

730
00:50:29,989 --> 00:50:32,480
Well, once again, you're all correct,

731
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:36,120
And once again, you're all incorrect,

732
00:50:42,836 --> 00:50:45,236
On with the game,

733
00:50:49,109 --> 00:50:53,409
( Toymaker)
You are now entering level four.

734
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:56,313
Level four? Wait a minute,

735
00:50:56,382 --> 00:50:59,010
Carmen's on this level,

736
00:51:07,994 --> 00:51:09,256
l'll use telepathy,

737
00:51:09,329 --> 00:51:11,661
We might be close enough that it'll work,

738
00:51:11,731 --> 00:51:13,631
( thinking) Carmen, can you hear me?

739
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:15,565
( Carmen) What?

740
00:51:15,635 --> 00:51:17,603
(Juni) This game plays tricks.

741
00:51:17,670 --> 00:51:20,468
Tell me something
only Carmen would say.

742
00:51:20,540 --> 00:51:22,974
( Carmen) My feet stink,

743
00:51:23,977 --> 00:51:25,444
You sound close,

744
00:51:25,512 --> 00:51:27,503
l am,

745
00:51:42,228 --> 00:51:45,254
l see you brought Grandpa into the game,

746
00:51:45,331 --> 00:51:47,595
l thought it was a good idea at the time,

747
00:51:47,667 --> 00:51:49,567
Juni!

748
00:51:49,636 --> 00:51:53,037
The Toymaker's the guy
who put Grandpa in the wheelchair

749
00:51:53,106 --> 00:51:55,040
30 years ago,

750
00:51:55,108 --> 00:51:56,769
Exactly,

751
00:51:56,843 --> 00:52:00,643
lf Grandpa tries to take revenge,
the Toymaker will break free,

752
00:52:00,713 --> 00:52:02,510
He's that powerful,

753
00:52:03,516 --> 00:52:07,247
Then we have to convince Grandpa
that revenge is not the way to solve it,

754
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:09,311
OK, Guy, We found your pal,

755
00:52:09,389 --> 00:52:12,222
Now, where are we going, exactly?
Where's level five?

756
00:52:12,292 --> 00:52:14,726
First of all, you don't
ask the questions around here,

757
00:52:14,794 --> 00:52:16,785
l do, Second of all--

758
00:52:16,863 --> 00:52:19,832
- We're going to Lava Mountain,
- We are?

759
00:52:19,899 --> 00:52:23,391
Beyond that is the passage to level five,

760
00:52:23,469 --> 00:52:24,561
l don't think so,

761
00:52:24,637 --> 00:52:26,935
Oh, so suddenly you're the game expert,

762
00:52:27,006 --> 00:52:29,201
We're following the Guy,

763
00:52:31,678 --> 00:52:34,704
You know, Juni, we don't need
these guys following us,

764
00:52:34,781 --> 00:52:36,043
Not where we're going,

765
00:52:36,115 --> 00:52:38,208
l promised them they could tag along,

766
00:52:38,284 --> 00:52:42,186
Look, this is how l know where to go,
Trust me,

767
00:52:45,124 --> 00:52:47,058
Lava Mountain,

768
00:52:47,126 --> 00:52:50,357
Why is it that every video game
has lava in it?

769
00:52:50,430 --> 00:52:52,125
( Francis) Technically, that's not true,

770
00:52:52,198 --> 00:52:54,189
There's no lava in Halo,

771
00:52:54,267 --> 00:52:56,360
And in Metroid, it's molten magma,

772
00:52:56,436 --> 00:52:59,098
Can't touch the lava, or it's game over,

773
00:52:59,172 --> 00:53:00,662
But l have six lives left,

774
00:53:00,740 --> 00:53:03,334
Doesn't matter,
You fall in, you lose,

775
00:53:03,409 --> 00:53:05,900
The game's getting tougher, guys,

776
00:53:05,979 --> 00:53:07,412
This is impossible,

777
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:10,449
What do you think, Grandpa?

778
00:53:10,516 --> 00:53:11,915
Difficult,

779
00:53:11,985 --> 00:53:15,546
Let's go another way,
Follow me, boys,

780
00:53:16,823 --> 00:53:19,348
This doesn't make any sense,

781
00:53:19,459 --> 00:53:21,450
l give them a map,

782
00:53:21,527 --> 00:53:23,518
l give them the girl,

783
00:53:23,596 --> 00:53:25,723
What more do they want?

784
00:53:25,798 --> 00:53:27,789
Can't l just lead them to the door?

785
00:53:27,867 --> 00:53:30,529
lmpossible, sir,
The way the game's A,l, works is--

786
00:53:30,603 --> 00:53:31,797
l know, l know,

787
00:53:31,871 --> 00:53:33,702
Can l just talk to myself at least?

788
00:53:33,773 --> 00:53:36,537
You are talking to yourself,
l am you,

789
00:53:36,609 --> 00:53:40,443
Well, then, you, me, shut up,

790
00:53:40,513 --> 00:53:41,946
So be it,

791
00:53:42,015 --> 00:53:43,243
Am l insane?

792
00:53:43,316 --> 00:53:44,977
Completely,

793
00:53:49,689 --> 00:53:52,590
They're going the wrong way,

794
00:53:52,659 --> 00:53:55,651
l have to drive them to level five,

795
00:53:59,632 --> 00:54:03,398
Send in the Tinker Toys,

796
00:54:05,271 --> 00:54:08,035
Finding another path,
Now, this is good thinking,

797
00:54:08,107 --> 00:54:10,439
She's good,
We should listen to her more often,

798
00:54:10,510 --> 00:54:14,105
- Stay off my side,
- OK,

799
00:54:14,180 --> 00:54:16,341
( machinery rattling)

800
00:54:20,186 --> 00:54:21,983
What is this?

801
00:54:27,961 --> 00:54:30,122
( chirping)

802
00:54:32,832 --> 00:54:35,232
Tinker Toys!

803
00:54:38,371 --> 00:54:42,273
Wait! What's worse, lava or Tinker Toys?

804
00:54:42,342 --> 00:54:45,038
Definitely Tinker Toys,

805
00:54:45,111 --> 00:54:47,102
Carmen, what do we do?

806
00:54:54,687 --> 00:54:56,678
( lava splashes)

807
00:55:14,540 --> 00:55:17,373
( up-tempo music plays)

808
00:55:22,815 --> 00:55:25,215
Whoa!

809
00:55:26,652 --> 00:55:27,812
Ugh!

810
00:55:31,024 --> 00:55:32,321
Uh-oh!

811
00:55:34,027 --> 00:55:35,255
Whoo-hoo!

812
00:55:35,328 --> 00:55:38,491
Rip that wave, Juni,

813
00:55:39,732 --> 00:55:41,666
What are they doing?

814
00:55:41,734 --> 00:55:43,827
They're straying from the path,

815
00:55:43,903 --> 00:55:46,463
The Toymaker must be
pushing them towards his lair,

816
00:55:46,539 --> 00:55:49,565
But why?
What could he gain from,,,

817
00:55:50,276 --> 00:55:53,541
Check if there's a connection between
the grandfather and the Toymaker,

818
00:55:53,613 --> 00:55:55,877
Hurry, people!

819
00:55:55,948 --> 00:55:58,439
lt's coming on-screen,

820
00:55:58,518 --> 00:56:00,713
Comrades turned enemies,

821
00:56:01,854 --> 00:56:05,085
Grandpa's gonna break the Toymaker
out of the game,

822
00:56:05,158 --> 00:56:06,625
Stop them,

823
00:56:06,692 --> 00:56:09,354
Stir the lava, Bigger waves,

824
00:56:09,429 --> 00:56:11,056
Lava monsters, Anything,

825
00:56:11,130 --> 00:56:12,927
We have to create obstacles for them,

826
00:56:12,999 --> 00:56:14,057
Come on!

827
00:56:14,133 --> 00:56:15,896
We have to drown them,

828
00:56:16,903 --> 00:56:20,304
They'll get a game over
and be evacuated from the game,

829
00:56:20,373 --> 00:56:23,467
We can't risk letting the Toymaker out,

830
00:56:25,511 --> 00:56:27,069
Do it,

831
00:56:34,620 --> 00:56:36,588
This is new,

832
00:56:36,656 --> 00:56:39,181
( roars)

833
00:56:40,626 --> 00:56:42,093
Juni!

834
00:56:46,232 --> 00:56:47,597
Carmen!

835
00:56:47,667 --> 00:56:49,635
( roaring)

836
00:56:50,670 --> 00:56:52,399
Francis!

837
00:56:53,573 --> 00:56:55,302
Arnold!

838
00:56:58,878 --> 00:57:00,869
Grandpa!

839
00:57:01,814 --> 00:57:03,714
Me,

840
00:57:04,784 --> 00:57:05,944
Aah!

841
00:57:07,053 --> 00:57:08,350
Where are they?

842
00:57:08,421 --> 00:57:09,547
They fell in,

843
00:57:09,622 --> 00:57:13,524
l know, but they should have
gotten a game over,

844
00:57:13,593 --> 00:57:15,424
They should be back here, actually,

845
00:57:15,495 --> 00:57:17,019
Hmm,

846
00:57:22,468 --> 00:57:24,026
( thinking) Huh?

847
00:57:25,271 --> 00:57:29,139
The lava. it's cold.

848
00:57:30,309 --> 00:57:35,008
( thinking) This way, Juni. This way.
We found a door to the next level.

849
00:57:35,882 --> 00:57:37,349
Come on.

850
00:57:39,552 --> 00:57:41,884
l thought l was a goner,

851
00:57:43,156 --> 00:57:46,148
l saw all my points
flashing away before my eyes,

852
00:57:46,225 --> 00:57:49,319
All l could hear was
my father saying, ''You blew it, Arnold,''

853
00:57:49,395 --> 00:57:52,057
''No untold riches for you,''

854
00:57:53,065 --> 00:57:54,794
Uhh!

855
00:57:57,470 --> 00:57:58,801
Where's Grandpa?

856
00:57:58,871 --> 00:58:00,896
l don't know, But he was here,

857
00:58:00,973 --> 00:58:03,373
lsn't this a piece of his armor?

858
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:10,579
Carmen, it's a passage,
Help me open it,

859
00:58:10,650 --> 00:58:11,981
Red flag, Rez,

860
00:58:12,051 --> 00:58:15,612
We have to talk about the Guy,
Highly sensitive,

861
00:58:15,688 --> 00:58:17,212
What about him?

862
00:58:17,290 --> 00:58:19,588
l've been rereading my tech manual,

863
00:58:19,659 --> 00:58:22,219
lt speaks of a deceiver within the game,

864
00:58:22,295 --> 00:58:25,264
who will mislead you down a path
where no one will survive,

865
00:58:25,331 --> 00:58:27,697
l think Juni's the deceiver,

866
00:58:28,601 --> 00:58:30,865
What do you suggest?

867
00:58:30,937 --> 00:58:34,964
We'll have to get rid of him
or risk losing the game,

868
00:58:36,375 --> 00:58:38,434
What about his sister?

869
00:58:38,511 --> 00:58:40,172
Her too,

870
00:58:44,650 --> 00:58:47,244
- How much time do we have left?
- Five minutes,

871
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:48,878
What happens in five minutes?

872
00:58:48,955 --> 00:58:51,617
This place gets flooded
with players from around the world,

873
00:58:51,691 --> 00:58:53,886
Oh, great, Competition,

874
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:55,894
The Toymaker will take over their minds,

875
00:58:55,962 --> 00:58:57,623
That's why we have to
shut down the game,

876
00:58:57,697 --> 00:59:00,791
- Sh, Carmen!
- What is she talking about?

877
00:59:01,934 --> 00:59:03,902
You didn't tell them yet, did you?

878
00:59:03,970 --> 00:59:05,460
l was getting around to it,

879
00:59:05,538 --> 00:59:07,597
Deceivers,

880
00:59:07,673 --> 00:59:09,800
What about the other side of level five?

881
00:59:09,875 --> 00:59:13,174
There is no other side,
You'll be imprisoned in the game,

882
00:59:13,246 --> 00:59:14,338
Game over,

883
00:59:14,413 --> 00:59:16,540
We're not letting you shut down this game,

884
00:59:16,616 --> 00:59:19,813
You're gonna see how fast
that counter can count backwards,

885
00:59:19,885 --> 00:59:23,321
You have to go through me first, game boy,

886
00:59:23,389 --> 00:59:26,153
Now, listen to me,
l'm the Guy,

887
00:59:26,225 --> 00:59:27,988
Stop saying you're the Guy,

888
00:59:28,060 --> 00:59:30,324
We all know that you're not the Guy,

889
00:59:30,396 --> 00:59:32,227
( man #2) He's not the Guy.

890
00:59:32,298 --> 00:59:34,459
( whirring)

891
00:59:37,136 --> 00:59:38,797
l am,

892
00:59:41,874 --> 00:59:43,364
And you are?

893
00:59:43,976 --> 00:59:46,410
l'm the Guy,

894
00:59:46,479 --> 00:59:48,174
The real Guy,

895
00:59:48,247 --> 00:59:49,373
And l say we go in,

896
00:59:49,448 --> 00:59:52,212
beat this unwinnable level,
and get to the other side,

897
00:59:52,285 --> 00:59:56,051
where untold riches
and a bounty fit for 1 0 kings awaits us,

898
00:59:56,122 --> 00:59:57,282
l knew it,

899
00:59:57,356 --> 00:59:59,722
Now, he's definitely the Guy,

900
01:00:00,359 --> 01:00:03,055
But it's unwinnable,

901
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:10,191
Nothing is unwinnable

902
01:00:10,269 --> 01:00:12,737
if we join together and battle as one,

903
01:00:12,805 --> 01:00:14,830
We play on each other's strengths

904
01:00:14,907 --> 01:00:17,034
and help cover each other's weaknesses,

905
01:00:17,109 --> 01:00:18,508
We can accomplish anything,

906
01:00:18,577 --> 01:00:21,307
And we will accomplish everything,

907
01:00:21,380 --> 01:00:26,317
But first let's go whip this unwinnable level

908
01:00:26,385 --> 01:00:27,852
and show it who's boss,

909
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:28,909
Are you with me?

910
01:00:28,988 --> 01:00:30,455
Yeah!

911
01:00:31,457 --> 01:00:33,322
Stand aside,

912
01:00:47,740 --> 01:00:49,264
Cake,

913
01:00:50,343 --> 01:00:53,141
Aah! Aah!

914
01:00:55,448 --> 01:00:57,211
( electricity crackling)

915
01:00:57,283 --> 01:00:58,614
( groaning)

916
01:01:00,453 --> 01:01:01,681
Oh!

917
01:01:01,754 --> 01:01:03,244
Oh, my,

918
01:01:06,559 --> 01:01:07,924
Oops,

919
01:01:10,262 --> 01:01:11,752
Guy!

920
01:01:12,865 --> 01:01:15,060
OK, You're the Guy again,

921
01:01:15,134 --> 01:01:16,795
Get us through this, Juni,

922
01:01:16,869 --> 01:01:18,359
But l,,,

923
01:01:28,481 --> 01:01:30,142
Demetra!

924
01:01:30,850 --> 01:01:32,010
Juni, quickly!

925
01:01:32,084 --> 01:01:33,984
l found the switch to shut down the game,

926
01:01:34,053 --> 01:01:35,577
l also found the exit portal,

927
01:01:35,654 --> 01:01:37,554
We can all get out of here right now,

928
01:01:37,623 --> 01:01:39,784
How did you survive?

929
01:01:39,859 --> 01:01:42,384
There was a glitch in the game,
l don't know,

930
01:01:42,461 --> 01:01:44,019
Juni, who is this?

931
01:01:44,096 --> 01:01:46,758
This is Demetra, my girlf,,,

932
01:01:46,832 --> 01:01:49,198
My friend,
No, she's my--

933
01:01:49,268 --> 01:01:52,135
l'm his girlfriend,
Who are you?

934
01:01:52,204 --> 01:01:54,195
l'm his sister,

935
01:01:54,273 --> 01:01:57,401
She gave me the map,
The map that got us here,

936
01:01:57,476 --> 01:01:59,444
Juni, she's not real,

937
01:02:00,312 --> 01:02:01,904
What are you talking about?

938
01:02:01,981 --> 01:02:03,915
l've been helping Juni win the game,

939
01:02:03,983 --> 01:02:05,314
What have you been doing?

940
01:02:05,384 --> 01:02:07,045
Playing prisoner, That's what,

941
01:02:07,119 --> 01:02:10,486
She set you up, Juni,
She set us all up,

942
01:02:10,556 --> 01:02:12,956
l,,, Juni, she's lying,

943
01:02:13,025 --> 01:02:14,617
She's been the Toymaker's prisoner,

944
01:02:14,693 --> 01:02:17,491
She could be brainwashed, for all we know,

945
01:02:17,563 --> 01:02:20,293
Do you want to win this game or not?

946
01:02:25,304 --> 01:02:28,000
She's the reason this level's unwinnable,

947
01:02:28,073 --> 01:02:29,973
She's the deceiver,

948
01:02:31,043 --> 01:02:32,169
Why?

949
01:02:32,244 --> 01:02:33,677
l'm sorry, Juni,

950
01:02:33,746 --> 01:02:37,079
But it's in my programming,

951
01:02:44,523 --> 01:02:46,081
( Toymaker) Congratulations!

952
01:02:46,158 --> 01:02:50,185
You've made it to the end
of the game! You won!

953
01:02:50,262 --> 01:02:52,992
Untold riches for all of you!

954
01:02:53,065 --> 01:02:57,866
And your prize
is you get to stay... here.

955
01:02:58,504 --> 01:03:01,098
Welcome to the game.

956
01:03:06,679 --> 01:03:08,442
( Grandpa) Juni, this way,

957
01:03:08,514 --> 01:03:09,708
This is the way out,

958
01:03:09,782 --> 01:03:11,807
All of you, quickly!

959
01:03:15,788 --> 01:03:17,881
Wait!
We have to shut down the game,

960
01:03:17,957 --> 01:03:20,084
l already did,
The switch is right there,

961
01:03:20,159 --> 01:03:21,387
- Are you sure?
- Yes, yes,

962
01:03:21,460 --> 01:03:24,293
Go, Quickly, quickly,

963
01:03:32,371 --> 01:03:34,066
Run, Grandpa!

964
01:03:34,139 --> 01:03:36,369
Go, l'll hold it open,

965
01:03:36,442 --> 01:03:37,466
Go now!

966
01:03:38,511 --> 01:03:40,001
Demetra,

967
01:03:40,079 --> 01:03:43,105
l can't hold it open forever, Juni,

968
01:03:49,455 --> 01:03:50,786
We made it,

969
01:03:51,790 --> 01:03:55,851
Here's our e-mail addresses,
Just in case,

970
01:03:55,928 --> 01:03:57,657
Terrific,

971
01:03:58,631 --> 01:04:00,292
You're awesome, Grandpa,

972
01:04:00,366 --> 01:04:03,335
The way you took on those Tinker Toys,

973
01:04:04,470 --> 01:04:06,404
You're the coolest,

974
01:04:09,542 --> 01:04:12,102
Thanks for everything, Guy,

975
01:04:12,177 --> 01:04:15,169
lt was real, Sort of,

976
01:04:16,215 --> 01:04:18,683
- Thanks a lot, Guy,
- ( knuckles cracking)

977
01:04:30,162 --> 01:04:32,426
What's wrong?

978
01:04:32,498 --> 01:04:34,796
You don't want to leave, do you?

979
01:04:34,867 --> 01:04:36,698
How can l go back, Juni?

980
01:04:37,303 --> 01:04:42,240
ln here, l can walk,
l can run,

981
01:04:42,308 --> 01:04:46,540
And you look at me
like l'm some kind of superhero,

982
01:04:46,612 --> 01:04:48,079
You are,

983
01:04:48,147 --> 01:04:51,378
Out there in the real world, to me,

984
01:04:51,450 --> 01:04:52,747
You are,

985
01:04:52,818 --> 01:04:54,718
All right, Juni,

986
01:04:54,787 --> 01:04:57,221
l shall go back if,,,

987
01:04:57,289 --> 01:05:01,988
if you promise me that even
though l'll be in a wheelchair,

988
01:05:03,228 --> 01:05:07,494
that you will look at me
no differently than you are now,

989
01:05:07,566 --> 01:05:14,495
Because on the inside, Juni,
on the inside, l feel like this,

990
01:05:16,208 --> 01:05:18,642
l promise, Grandpa,

991
01:05:20,813 --> 01:05:23,008
Time to go,

992
01:05:26,885 --> 01:05:28,375
( applause)

993
01:05:33,425 --> 01:05:36,087
Coming through,
Coming through, please,

994
01:05:36,161 --> 01:05:38,994
Those video games
are killers on the eyes, huh, kid?

995
01:05:39,064 --> 01:05:41,032
Agent Cortez, we'll take it from here,

996
01:05:41,100 --> 01:05:43,330
My grandson will handle this,

997
01:05:43,402 --> 01:05:46,769
Don't touch,
This is Corinthian leather,

998
01:05:48,073 --> 01:05:50,598
( whispering)

999
01:05:52,678 --> 01:05:53,542
OK,

1000
01:05:53,612 --> 01:05:57,207
So tell me again
how you shut off the game,

1001
01:05:57,282 --> 01:05:59,307
l don't know if we shut it down, exactly,

1002
01:05:59,385 --> 01:06:01,148
We hit a switch, and it seemed to work,

1003
01:06:01,220 --> 01:06:03,211
Oh, it worked,
The game's down,

1004
01:06:03,288 --> 01:06:06,223
We just need to make sure
we did this correctly,

1005
01:06:06,291 --> 01:06:09,260
Actually, Grandpa hit the switch,

1006
01:06:09,328 --> 01:06:12,263
Cortez, are these the boys
that were in the game with you?

1007
01:06:12,331 --> 01:06:14,492
We tracked them
through their e-mail addresses,

1008
01:06:14,566 --> 01:06:18,058
Yeah, that's them,
They wouldn't know anything about,,,

1009
01:06:18,137 --> 01:06:19,468
Hey, wait a second,

1010
01:06:19,538 --> 01:06:21,904
What happened to Francis the Brain,

1011
01:06:21,974 --> 01:06:23,999
Arnold the Strong, and Mr, Cool?

1012
01:06:24,076 --> 01:06:27,307
Well, in the real world, l'm not that smart,

1013
01:06:27,379 --> 01:06:29,370
l'm not strong,

1014
01:06:29,448 --> 01:06:30,972
l'm not cool,

1015
01:06:32,184 --> 01:06:33,515
Reality check,

1016
01:06:33,585 --> 01:06:35,917
So who are you out here in the real world?

1017
01:06:35,988 --> 01:06:38,957
Special Agent Cortez, we need you,

1018
01:06:39,558 --> 01:06:40,889
Whoa,

1019
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:44,724
l'm just Juni Cortez,

1020
01:06:44,797 --> 01:06:48,961
Let's have it, Grandpa,
What switch did you hit exactly?

1021
01:06:49,034 --> 01:06:51,059
There were two switches side by side,

1022
01:06:51,136 --> 01:06:52,933
One switch shuts down the game,

1023
01:06:53,005 --> 01:06:54,996
But the other releases the Toymaker,

1024
01:06:55,074 --> 01:06:57,167
Who was the idiot who designed that?

1025
01:06:57,242 --> 01:06:59,836
( sighs/clears throat)

1026
01:06:59,912 --> 01:07:02,437
Did you free the Toymaker by accident?

1027
01:07:02,514 --> 01:07:05,574
Oh, l freed the Toymaker,
But it was no accident,

1028
01:07:05,651 --> 01:07:07,983
Do you want to stop the game?

1029
01:07:08,053 --> 01:07:11,352
Then you must defeat the Toymaker,
lt's the only way,

1030
01:07:11,423 --> 01:07:12,754
You crazy old man!

1031
01:07:12,825 --> 01:07:14,793
Do you know what you've done?

1032
01:07:15,794 --> 01:07:17,989
Grandpa, revenge doesn't solve anything,

1033
01:07:18,864 --> 01:07:21,560
Will you trust me?
You of all people?

1034
01:07:22,267 --> 01:07:23,632
A message from the president,

1035
01:07:23,702 --> 01:07:25,499
Oh, what does he want?

1036
01:07:26,038 --> 01:07:30,498
i'm coming back to settle the score.

1037
01:07:30,576 --> 01:07:32,806
( distorted) For imprisoning me.

1038
01:07:32,878 --> 01:07:34,607
For using me.

1039
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:36,204
Devlin set us up?

1040
01:07:36,281 --> 01:07:37,805
lt's not Devlin,

1041
01:07:38,450 --> 01:07:42,477
All i wanted to do was right the wrongs.

1042
01:07:42,554 --> 01:07:44,249
Start over a new world.

1043
01:07:44,323 --> 01:07:46,450
A new chance,

1044
01:07:46,525 --> 01:07:50,427
where everyone would get
a second chance!

1045
01:07:51,396 --> 01:07:53,091
But no.

1046
01:07:54,533 --> 01:07:59,095
So now i'm taking this
to the next level!

1047
01:07:59,171 --> 01:08:00,502
( rumbling)

1048
01:08:01,640 --> 01:08:03,574
Seismic activity off the map!

1049
01:08:03,642 --> 01:08:05,200
- Aah!
- Aah!

1050
01:08:05,277 --> 01:08:06,301
Earthquake!

1051
01:08:06,378 --> 01:08:07,777
Tornado!

1052
01:08:07,846 --> 01:08:08,835
Hurricane!

1053
01:08:09,414 --> 01:08:11,382
Carmen, let's go!

1054
01:08:11,450 --> 01:08:13,315
Everybody, relax!

1055
01:08:14,486 --> 01:08:15,783
( both panting)

1056
01:08:17,256 --> 01:08:19,190
( heavy footsteps)

1057
01:08:29,768 --> 01:08:30,757
( growls)

1058
01:08:31,336 --> 01:08:33,031
Quick! Put your glasses on,

1059
01:08:33,105 --> 01:08:36,199
lt's the only way you can see
what's really happening,

1060
01:08:36,275 --> 01:08:39,108
The game has entered the real world,

1061
01:08:41,113 --> 01:08:42,171
( roars)

1062
01:08:42,347 --> 01:08:45,282
There's only one thing to do
in a situation like this,

1063
01:08:45,317 --> 01:08:46,249
What?

1064
01:08:46,752 --> 01:08:49,983
Call in the family,
Calling all Cortezes,

1065
01:08:51,323 --> 01:08:55,225
This is it, This is it,

1066
01:08:55,294 --> 01:08:56,784
This is it,

1067
01:08:56,862 --> 01:08:59,422
The moment we've been waiting for,

1068
01:08:59,498 --> 01:09:00,965
Yes,

1069
01:09:01,033 --> 01:09:03,593
Nobody move, Nobody move!

1070
01:09:03,669 --> 01:09:06,365
Nobody touch the brain,
The fifth brain,

1071
01:09:06,438 --> 01:09:08,531
( electricity crackles)

1072
01:09:09,441 --> 01:09:11,466
This is a historic moment,

1073
01:09:11,543 --> 01:09:14,011
Probably the,,,

1074
01:09:17,382 --> 01:09:20,613
Probably the most important,,,

1075
01:09:20,686 --> 01:09:21,812
No,

1076
01:09:22,821 --> 01:09:26,382
This is the most important
moment of my life,

1077
01:09:27,793 --> 01:09:30,023
No one can disturb me now,

1078
01:09:30,095 --> 01:09:33,462
l must activate the brain,

1079
01:09:35,100 --> 01:09:36,089
Now,

1080
01:09:36,168 --> 01:09:37,430
- Mr, Cortez?
- Eh?

1081
01:09:37,502 --> 01:09:41,268
Your children called,
Some sort of emergency,

1082
01:09:53,518 --> 01:09:55,577
Well, l'm their uncle,

1083
01:10:02,561 --> 01:10:04,791
Dad, you need these to see,

1084
01:10:04,863 --> 01:10:06,091
Glasses, quick!

1085
01:10:16,141 --> 01:10:17,972
lncoming,

1086
01:10:36,895 --> 01:10:38,487
This won't be easy,

1087
01:10:38,563 --> 01:10:40,394
( grunting)

1088
01:10:43,969 --> 01:10:46,028
Let's kick some metal,

1089
01:10:48,707 --> 01:10:51,073
( groaning)

1090
01:10:55,147 --> 01:10:57,547
What about all the other ones?

1091
01:11:01,353 --> 01:11:03,878
We need more help,
Our family isn't big enough,

1092
01:11:03,956 --> 01:11:07,187
Remember one thing,
Everyone's your family,

1093
01:11:09,962 --> 01:11:13,864
Calling,,, everyone,

1094
01:11:17,402 --> 01:11:19,495
We're here to save the day,

1095
01:11:20,105 --> 01:11:21,970
Floop and Minion!

1096
01:11:27,245 --> 01:11:29,076
Robot children!

1097
01:11:30,082 --> 01:11:32,209
Take 'em down!

1098
01:11:34,152 --> 01:11:36,586
Dinky Winks!

1099
01:11:40,158 --> 01:11:43,252
Somebody ring the Dinkster?

1100
01:11:46,999 --> 01:11:48,398
Whoa!

1101
01:11:49,301 --> 01:11:53,203
You're gonna make a nice addition
to my theme park,

1102
01:11:54,773 --> 01:11:58,334
Game over for you, pal,
Game over!

1103
01:12:04,383 --> 01:12:06,283
Somebody call in a loon?

1104
01:12:07,152 --> 01:12:09,712
Sorry, Romero,
this is the only pair we had left,

1105
01:12:09,788 --> 01:12:11,915
They're a little broken,

1106
01:12:11,990 --> 01:12:14,049
They're perfect,

1107
01:12:14,926 --> 01:12:17,121
Charge, Sporky!

1108
01:12:18,163 --> 01:12:19,630
Brand him, Daddy,

1109
01:12:20,165 --> 01:12:22,258
Thanks, Little Dink,

1110
01:12:26,938 --> 01:12:28,462
( groaning)

1111
01:12:29,608 --> 01:12:31,269
- Unh!
- Unh!

1112
01:12:37,549 --> 01:12:38,607
Gary Giggles?

1113
01:12:39,751 --> 01:12:41,343
- Yeah?
- Carmen Cortez.

1114
01:12:41,420 --> 01:12:42,819
i need your help right away.

1115
01:12:42,888 --> 01:12:44,549
l'm there,

1116
01:12:47,659 --> 01:12:48,819
l'm here,

1117
01:12:48,894 --> 01:12:50,555
Give me a hand,

1118
01:12:51,329 --> 01:12:52,318
Whoa,

1119
01:12:56,201 --> 01:12:58,192
- Unh!
- Thanks,

1120
01:13:02,340 --> 01:13:04,001
- Hey,
- Hey,

1121
01:13:05,544 --> 01:13:06,511
Thank you, Gerti,

1122
01:13:07,746 --> 01:13:10,271
There's still one more,

1123
01:13:24,629 --> 01:13:26,460
That's impossible,

1124
01:13:26,531 --> 01:13:28,465
Someone has to go up there,

1125
01:13:28,533 --> 01:13:30,433
And shut it down manually,

1126
01:13:30,502 --> 01:13:32,800
lt's the only way,

1127
01:13:32,871 --> 01:13:35,066
But who?

1128
01:13:35,140 --> 01:13:37,438
l'm ready,

1129
01:13:37,509 --> 01:13:40,000
lt must be done,

1130
01:13:41,446 --> 01:13:42,913
Grandpa, no!

1131
01:13:42,981 --> 01:13:45,848
Let him go,
Your grandfather has to do this,

1132
01:13:56,094 --> 01:13:59,495
Thank you for freeing me,
Valentin, but it's too late,

1133
01:13:59,564 --> 01:14:02,328
Nothing can stop me, Not even you,

1134
01:14:03,268 --> 01:14:06,066
That's true, Only you can do that,

1135
01:14:06,671 --> 01:14:08,730
You double-crossed us,

1136
01:14:08,807 --> 01:14:12,106
The agency, your fellow agents, and me,

1137
01:14:12,177 --> 01:14:15,203
Your mistake cost me my legs,

1138
01:14:15,747 --> 01:14:16,873
Well, a mistake like that

1139
01:14:16,948 --> 01:14:19,815
could only push someone
further into the dark,

1140
01:14:19,885 --> 01:14:21,648
And it has,

1141
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:23,153
Look at you now,

1142
01:14:23,221 --> 01:14:25,155
l gave you back your legs in the game,

1143
01:14:25,223 --> 01:14:27,157
l did that for you,

1144
01:14:28,326 --> 01:14:32,695
Let me tell you all the things
l've missed in my life

1145
01:14:32,764 --> 01:14:35,995
because of the accident you caused,

1146
01:14:36,601 --> 01:14:39,399
l can't walk on the beach with my wife,

1147
01:14:40,272 --> 01:14:43,469
l missed my daughter's birth,

1148
01:14:44,042 --> 01:14:45,634
And wedding,

1149
01:14:46,912 --> 01:14:48,436
Shall l continue?

1150
01:14:51,650 --> 01:14:54,016
Grandpa,

1151
01:14:54,085 --> 01:14:55,712
Don't,

1152
01:14:55,787 --> 01:15:00,156
Now let me tell you
all the good things that came of it,

1153
01:15:01,092 --> 01:15:02,650
Humility,

1154
01:15:02,727 --> 01:15:04,592
Spirituality,

1155
01:15:04,663 --> 01:15:05,960
Understanding,

1156
01:15:06,031 --> 01:15:09,728
You've been living in fear of me
all these years,

1157
01:15:09,801 --> 01:15:12,326
But l've only been searching for you

1158
01:15:12,404 --> 01:15:16,864
so l could tell you that l forgive you,

1159
01:15:21,246 --> 01:15:25,706
l've only dreamed l would hear
you say something like that,

1160
01:15:25,784 --> 01:15:30,016
Now the question is,
can you forgive yourself?

1161
01:15:30,088 --> 01:15:33,387
lt's never too late, Sebastian,

1162
01:15:33,458 --> 01:15:36,655
Take your time,
Take your time to decide,

1163
01:15:36,728 --> 01:15:39,822
We have about 1 0 seconds,

1164
01:15:39,898 --> 01:15:41,559
( rumbling)

1165
01:15:44,502 --> 01:15:46,163
Game,,,

1166
01:15:47,472 --> 01:15:48,700
over,

1167
01:15:51,977 --> 01:15:55,174
Juni, get out of there!

1168
01:16:15,066 --> 01:16:16,829
Grandpa!

1169
01:16:30,015 --> 01:16:31,812
So, wait a minute,

1170
01:16:32,851 --> 01:16:35,081
Who won?

1171
01:16:36,388 --> 01:16:39,186
lt's not whether you win or lose,

1172
01:16:39,257 --> 01:16:42,715
lt's how you play the game,

1173
01:16:44,062 --> 01:16:45,086

And break!

Hey, how you doin', Valentin?

Hey, l know,

1201
01:18:38,810 --> 01:18:41,404
All right, Here we go,
Settle, please,

1202
01:18:41,479 --> 01:18:45,438
Yo, Valentin!
What are you doin' in space?

1203
01:18:46,384 --> 01:18:47,544
You,,,

1204
01:18:48,286 --> 01:18:49,446

1206
01:18:52,090 --> 01:18:53,148
Oh!

1207
01:18:58,062 --> 01:18:59,188
Take 'em down!

1208
01:19:00,632 --> 01:19:03,032
OK, Fists, Good,

1209
01:19:03,101 --> 01:19:05,092
What else is new?

1210
01:19:05,170 --> 01:19:06,262
This is different,

1211
01:19:06,337 --> 01:19:07,964
Once you get through the game,

1212
01:19:08,039 --> 01:19:10,030
your mind belongs to the Toymaker,

1213
01:19:10,108 --> 01:19:12,099
Aah!
Let's do it again right away,

1214
01:19:12,177 --> 01:19:16,273
l'm coming back to settle the score,

1215
01:19:17,615 --> 01:19:20,345
( imitating Sylvester Stallone)
For imprisoning me,

1216
01:19:20,418 --> 01:19:23,080
For using me,

1217
01:19:27,692 --> 01:19:30,593
That might be the end
of my career right there,

Da's beter.
Dank je schat.

1262
01:23:58,663 --> 01:23:59,789
Hoe lang wist je het ?

01:24:01,065 --> 01:24:02,760

1265
01:24:02,834 --> 01:24:04,495
Dus waarom vertel je het dan ?
