[soothing music]
[birds chirping]

186
00:15:51,602 --> 00:15:54,475
[electricity buzzing]

187
00:16:01,612 --> 00:16:05,442
Just to be clear, they
reached out to me first.

188
00:16:06,835 --> 00:16:09,316
It was like, three years ago.

189
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,059
- Okay.

190
00:16:13,102 --> 00:16:15,583
- First it was just
a flash of light,

191
00:16:15,626 --> 00:16:16,671
flash of color.

192
00:16:19,935 --> 00:16:23,286
But they started flying
geometric patterns,

193
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:26,811
I thought it'd be rude not to
acknowledge their presence.

194
00:16:28,074 --> 00:16:30,467
But they found me for a reason.

195
00:16:31,381 --> 00:16:32,121
They knew.

196
00:16:35,255 --> 00:16:36,517
- Knew what, Dad?

197
00:16:38,867 --> 00:16:40,738
- That I was listening.

198
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:15,686
[birds chirping]

199
00:17:44,585 --> 00:17:46,630
It's pulsing, it's
sending signals.

200
00:17:46,674 --> 00:17:49,633
There's no question in
my mind, it's pulsing,

201
00:17:49,677 --> 00:17:51,592
it's completely
shape-shifting, okay?

202
00:17:51,635 --> 00:17:54,073
Now they're moving back
into a more fundamental,

203
00:17:54,116 --> 00:17:55,944
almost triangulated formation.

204
00:17:55,987 --> 00:17:59,643
But the red orb is
clearly, oh look at that.

205
00:17:59,687 --> 00:18:01,297
I'm gonna assume
that's the leader.

206
00:18:01,341 --> 00:18:04,735
It's so abrupt, and so quick.

207
00:18:04,779 --> 00:18:07,390
[eerie music]

208
00:18:10,306 --> 00:18:12,395
Could pose some
sort of a threat,

209
00:18:12,439 --> 00:18:15,050
probably would've known
about it a long time ago.

210
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:17,966
Push came to shove, it
can do some shoving back.

211
00:18:19,141 --> 00:18:22,231
I know how to defend
the northwest quadrant.

212
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:27,802
All I've ever seen is
peace and contentment

213
00:18:27,845 --> 00:18:29,108
in their signaling.

214
00:18:30,544 --> 00:18:31,893
Hey!

215
00:18:31,936 --> 00:18:33,677
What the fuck are
you doing here?

216
00:18:33,721 --> 00:18:36,550
I warned you people
not to show up again!

217
00:18:37,725 --> 00:18:39,727
You don't have any
authority to be here!

218
00:18:47,561 --> 00:18:50,259
[waves crashing]

219
00:18:56,657 --> 00:18:59,790
[gentle piano music]

220
00:19:51,277 --> 00:19:54,105
[water trickling]

221
00:19:56,978 --> 00:20:01,200
Yeah, they were really
biting, about a month ago.

222
00:20:04,246 --> 00:20:06,117
Probably not gonna
get anything today.

223
00:20:07,336 --> 00:20:09,251
- Never used to catch
much fish anyway, Dad.

224
00:20:09,295 --> 00:20:10,121
- Oh.
- So.

225
00:20:11,079 --> 00:20:13,255
- You used to catch your share,

226
00:20:13,299 --> 00:20:15,475
but I don't know about today.

227
00:20:15,518 --> 00:20:17,738
We'll probably have to
manage our expectations.

228
00:20:20,436 --> 00:20:21,220
How's Michael?

229
00:20:23,526 --> 00:20:26,137
- Haven't seen him
for a very long time.

230
00:20:31,055 --> 00:20:32,622
There's a Ben, though.

231
00:20:36,844 --> 00:20:41,065
Ben is my husband.

232
00:20:44,982 --> 00:20:45,722
I got married.

233
00:20:50,466 --> 00:20:54,688
It wasn't a big event,
or anything like that.

234
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:57,821
Just him and I at town hall.

235
00:20:58,866 --> 00:21:00,607
Our friend made us dinner later.

236
00:21:03,784 --> 00:21:06,221
Mom wasn't there,
Bucky wasn't there.

237
00:21:07,353 --> 00:21:08,354
It was really small.

238
00:21:11,182 --> 00:21:13,881
- What's his name, Ben?
- Mm-hmm.

239
00:21:16,013 --> 00:21:17,276
- What does he do?

240
00:21:18,973 --> 00:21:20,583
- He's a graphic designer.

241
00:21:21,845 --> 00:21:22,846
He's a good person.

242
00:21:24,718 --> 00:21:25,893
I think you'd like him.

243
00:21:27,808 --> 00:21:30,071
Maybe not some of
his jokes, but.

244
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:34,858
- Does he know how
to use a chainsaw?

245
00:21:37,034 --> 00:21:38,035
- Dad.

246
00:21:39,428 --> 00:21:40,299
- That's important.

247
00:21:44,346 --> 00:21:48,524
Well, I've always
heard the best way

248
00:21:48,568 --> 00:21:50,744
to make a marriage last-

249
00:21:50,787 --> 00:21:52,789
- Dad, I don't want this.

250
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,314
Let's just fish.

251
00:21:57,838 --> 00:22:00,710
- I think fathers are supposed
to give daughters advice.

252
00:22:00,754 --> 00:22:01,537
- Yeah.

253
00:22:02,973 --> 00:22:03,887
Sometimes.

254
00:22:07,195 --> 00:22:07,978
Not now.

255
00:22:15,421 --> 00:22:17,031
- Oh, shit.

256
00:22:19,207 --> 00:22:19,990
Maggie.

257
00:22:21,427 --> 00:22:25,039
Maggie, Maggie, Maggie,
Maggie, Maggie, Maggie, Maggie.

258
00:22:26,649 --> 00:22:29,609
Mr. Bobby Sock, in the house!

259
00:22:29,652 --> 00:22:32,916
Oh well, Bobby
Sock on the creek.

260
00:22:34,222 --> 00:22:36,659
[Maggie laughs]

261
00:22:36,703 --> 00:22:38,531
Come on, talk to old Bobby.

262
00:22:38,574 --> 00:22:40,837
Bobby'd help you out
with all your problems.

263
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:47,017
- Hi, Bobby.
- What's up, Maggie?

264
00:22:47,061 --> 00:22:48,323
- It's been a long time.

265
00:22:49,324 --> 00:22:52,588
- Too long, Maggie, too long.

266
00:22:56,810 --> 00:22:57,593
- What,

267
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:02,076
what are you doing here?

268
00:23:02,119 --> 00:23:03,686
- I just had to drop by,

269
00:23:05,035 --> 00:23:08,082
see if there's anything heart
to heart you wanna talk about.

270
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:13,957
- Well, yeah I
could use your help.

271
00:23:14,001 --> 00:23:15,045
- Cool.

272
00:23:18,701 --> 00:23:20,137
- I'm worried about my dad.

273
00:23:25,099 --> 00:23:26,143
- Okay.

274
00:23:28,668 --> 00:23:31,975
- He's out here, in
the middle of nowhere,

275
00:23:32,019 --> 00:23:35,283
with no friends, just a dog,

276
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,069
some moving lights, a sock.

277
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:44,118
And I worry about him.

278
00:23:49,123 --> 00:23:51,560
Do you know the last time
he went to the doctor?

279
00:23:55,695 --> 00:23:57,436
Do you think it's
been a long time?

280
00:24:02,092 --> 00:24:04,051
I've been noticing
these things about him.

281
00:24:07,184 --> 00:24:10,536
We'll be talking,
and he's with me,

282
00:24:11,667 --> 00:24:13,103
and then suddenly...

283
00:24:18,369 --> 00:24:19,980
Do you know what that's about?

284
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:30,207
I um,

285
00:24:32,296 --> 00:24:33,994
I'll go to the doctor with you.

286
00:24:36,562 --> 00:24:38,215
You know, just for a check up.

287
00:24:41,001 --> 00:24:42,698
I'd like to do that with you.

288
00:24:42,742 --> 00:24:43,873
- Is today Tuesday?

289
00:24:49,096 --> 00:24:50,140
- Mm-hmm.

290
00:24:57,626 --> 00:24:59,019
- Wanna get a milkshake?

291
00:25:01,935 --> 00:25:02,718
- Sure.

292
00:25:07,027 --> 00:25:09,508
[gentle music]

293
00:25:28,614 --> 00:25:31,442
[bell dings]

294
00:25:31,486 --> 00:25:33,096
- This is where Charlie works.

295
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:34,750
Yeah, she's great.

296
00:25:34,794 --> 00:25:39,276
She's the only cool person
in this godforsaken town.

297
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:40,843
Ah, Charlie.
- Hey.

298
00:25:40,887 --> 00:25:41,757
- How are you?

299
00:25:41,801 --> 00:25:43,324
- I am well, how are you?

300
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:46,457
- Charlie, this is
Maggie, my daughter.

301
00:25:46,501 --> 00:25:48,982
This is Charles, my friend.

302
00:25:49,025 --> 00:25:49,983
- Hey.
- Hello.

303
00:25:52,899 --> 00:25:53,813
- How's Migo doing?

304
00:25:53,856 --> 00:25:56,555
- He's good, he's good, yeah.

305
00:26:01,081 --> 00:26:02,125
We're gonna eat.

306
00:26:02,169 --> 00:26:03,126
- Okay, I'll get
your table ready.

307
00:26:05,215 --> 00:26:07,522
[Lloyd sighs]

308
00:26:09,219 --> 00:26:11,700
- Egg whites in
last, fold them in,

309
00:26:11,744 --> 00:26:15,138
keep the bubbles,
no flat pancakes.

310
00:26:16,313 --> 00:26:17,880
- That would be tragic.

311
00:26:17,924 --> 00:26:19,882
- Milkshakes.
- Nice!

312
00:26:21,144 --> 00:26:24,670
- You guys look like you've
had an adventure today.

313
00:26:24,713 --> 00:26:26,280
What have you been doing?

314
00:26:26,323 --> 00:26:28,935
- We went fishing,
with Bobby Sock.

315
00:26:30,327 --> 00:26:32,068
- Who's Bobby Sock?

316
00:26:32,112 --> 00:26:33,026
- He's a sock.

317
00:26:35,332 --> 00:26:36,116
- You wanna?

318
00:26:37,334 --> 00:26:39,641
- I think it was
in middle school,

319
00:26:39,685 --> 00:26:43,602
and there was a kid that
was messing with her.

320
00:26:43,645 --> 00:26:48,171
I think his name, was
it Sean Boogerson?

321
00:26:48,215 --> 00:26:49,433
- Bookerson.

322
00:26:49,477 --> 00:26:50,652
- So he was chasing her
around the playground,

323
00:26:50,696 --> 00:26:52,436
hitting her in the back.

324
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:56,658
- No, Steve Bookerson was a guy

325
00:26:56,702 --> 00:26:58,225
who used to follow me
from class to class,

326
00:26:58,268 --> 00:27:00,531
singing "Walk Like a
Man, Talk Like a Man,"

327
00:27:00,575 --> 00:27:03,622
because my voice had dropped
significantly that year,

328
00:27:03,665 --> 00:27:06,276
and he thought it was very
funny, and very clever.

329
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,104
- For some reason,
I thought he was-

330
00:27:08,148 --> 00:27:10,106
- And he got the whole bus
singing it on our class trip

331
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:13,370
on the way back from
the Exploratorium,

332
00:27:13,414 --> 00:27:16,156
so that was the day
that I ran away.

333
00:27:16,199 --> 00:27:17,331
- Where did you go to?

334
00:27:18,375 --> 00:27:20,551
- Very far away place.

335
00:27:20,595 --> 00:27:24,294
- The fort that we
built in the backyard.

336
00:27:25,774 --> 00:27:29,212
I wanted to be supportive,
so I brought her a juice box.

337
00:27:29,256 --> 00:27:30,649
- Took me a Snack Pack.

338
00:27:30,692 --> 00:27:32,259
- Aww.

339
00:27:32,302 --> 00:27:34,478
- Hoping that she would
come back into the house.

340
00:27:35,523 --> 00:27:36,393
- Had nice words.

341
00:27:36,437 --> 00:27:38,439
- And she wouldn't talk to me,

342
00:27:38,482 --> 00:27:41,834
but she'd talk to Bobby Sock.

343
00:27:41,877 --> 00:27:43,749
- What did he say?

344
00:27:43,792 --> 00:27:46,577
- He said, "This
too shall pass."

345
00:27:47,709 --> 00:27:49,276
- The voice gets me every time.

346
00:27:50,451 --> 00:27:51,321
- Are you sure
that was his name?

347
00:27:51,365 --> 00:27:53,149
- How could I forget it?

348
00:27:53,193 --> 00:27:54,673
That stuff sticks.

349
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,372
So silly, but it does.

350
00:28:00,461 --> 00:28:02,332
- [Lloyd] Bobby
Sock to the rescue.

351
00:28:04,421 --> 00:28:06,249
- Here's to Bobby Sock.
- Yes.

352
00:28:06,293 --> 00:28:07,381
Here's to Bobby Sock.

353
00:28:08,556 --> 00:28:09,339
- Bobby Sock.

354
00:28:13,953 --> 00:28:16,346
[gentle music]

355
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:19,349
[electricity buzzing]

356
00:28:20,307 --> 00:28:23,136
[keys clacking]

357
00:28:25,573 --> 00:28:28,663
- [Lloyd] Yeah, and
I've only seen it once.

358
00:28:29,795 --> 00:28:32,406
I don't even remember when.

359
00:28:32,449 --> 00:28:33,799
Was it 2008, 2007?

360
00:28:35,409 --> 00:28:37,150
That's really, it's
the white whale.

361
00:28:39,108 --> 00:28:43,722
White whale, white whale,
white whale, white whale.

362
00:28:43,765 --> 00:28:46,550
If I'm Ahab, he's
the white whale.

363
00:28:47,987 --> 00:28:50,990
Unidentified white
whale, he's huge.

364
00:28:53,601 --> 00:28:57,300
Great oceanic beast,
but in the galaxy.

365
00:29:01,087 --> 00:29:02,741
- What?
- And it's long,

366
00:29:02,784 --> 00:29:04,612
like a bridal train.

367
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:10,313
- Dad.
- A galactic serpent.

368
00:29:10,357 --> 00:29:11,358
- You okay?

369
00:29:11,401 --> 00:29:12,315
Dad, what's up?

370
00:29:13,403 --> 00:29:14,361
What are you doing?

371
00:29:14,404 --> 00:29:16,711
- Just watching you.

372
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:18,974
This way I used to watch you

373
00:29:19,018 --> 00:29:23,805
when I'd be at your basketball
games, sitting on the bench.

374
00:29:23,849 --> 00:29:27,417
- Key words, on the bench.

375
00:29:27,461 --> 00:29:28,897
- Slam dunk Tuesday.

376
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:31,334
Pretty good.

377
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,599
- You remember that?

378
00:29:35,643 --> 00:29:36,818
- Oh yeah.

379
00:29:36,862 --> 00:29:39,299
- I wrote that a
very long time ago.

380
00:29:39,342 --> 00:29:42,171
What was I, six, seven, eight?

381
00:29:42,215 --> 00:29:43,782
I'm surprised you remember that.

382
00:29:43,825 --> 00:29:47,960
- That's just nice to see that
you're pursuing your passion.

383
00:29:48,003 --> 00:29:51,137
- Funny that you say
that, because I'm-

384
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:53,269
- Wait, wait, this
is the best part.

385
00:29:55,402 --> 00:29:57,360
Tuesday night, night,
night, night, night, night.

386
00:30:05,629 --> 00:30:06,413
Yeah.

387
00:30:09,416 --> 00:30:12,419
[crickets chirping]

388
00:30:14,203 --> 00:30:16,902
[birds chirping]

389
00:30:25,954 --> 00:30:28,696
[Maggie humming]

390
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:32,787
Here you go.

391
00:30:34,528 --> 00:30:37,705
Just country coffee, chicory.

392
00:30:37,748 --> 00:30:40,751
It's not anything fancy
like you get in the city.

393
00:30:40,795 --> 00:30:42,841
- I don't drink fancy
coffee in the city.

394
00:30:44,407 --> 00:30:45,408
- Right.

395
00:30:50,544 --> 00:30:52,938
It's gonna look
better when it's dry.

396
00:30:52,981 --> 00:30:53,852
- Yeah, I'm sure.

397
00:30:55,027 --> 00:30:56,680
- Acidman's kind
of funny, though.

398
00:30:58,073 --> 00:30:59,379
Acid man.

399
00:31:00,597 --> 00:31:03,513
It's townie kids,
just fucking around.

400
00:31:05,385 --> 00:31:07,256
- Yeah, I was gonna ask you.

401
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:08,562
What made you pick this place?

402
00:31:08,605 --> 00:31:11,739
- You know, it's a good
place to be left alone.

403
00:31:13,523 --> 00:31:15,699
- Sorry that's not
working out for you.

404
00:31:15,743 --> 00:31:17,092
- It's working out for me.

405
00:31:19,051 --> 00:31:19,921
What about you, Maggie?

406
00:31:19,965 --> 00:31:21,401
What brings you out here?

407
00:31:22,619 --> 00:31:26,623
- I told you, I wanted
to check in on you.

408
00:31:28,538 --> 00:31:29,322
- What else?

409
00:31:34,762 --> 00:31:37,069
Come on, Migo, come on.

410
00:31:37,112 --> 00:31:39,114
Leave bullshit Betty out here

411
00:31:40,028 --> 00:31:41,508
to come up with a better answer.

412
00:31:44,293 --> 00:31:46,121
[Maggie groans]

413
00:31:46,165 --> 00:31:46,905
- Hey!

414
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:48,950
[things clatter]

415
00:31:48,994 --> 00:31:50,212
Fucking shit!

416
00:31:52,693 --> 00:31:54,564
You know, how about a thank you

417
00:31:54,608 --> 00:31:56,740
for traveling 2,000
miles to be here?

418
00:31:56,784 --> 00:31:58,612
Do you know what that took?

419
00:31:58,655 --> 00:32:01,789
A plane, a layover, another
plane, a long ass car journey

420
00:32:01,832 --> 00:32:03,617
that was 18 hours, door to door.

421
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:06,402
That is what it took
to be here with you.

422
00:32:06,446 --> 00:32:07,360
No thank you for that, okay.

423
00:32:07,403 --> 00:32:08,491
How about to a lesser degree,

424
00:32:08,535 --> 00:32:10,493
thank you for the
paint job, Maggie?

425
00:32:10,537 --> 00:32:12,452
Or thank you for
spending three weeks

426
00:32:12,495 --> 00:32:15,585
trying to find out where
the hell you fucking were?

427
00:32:15,629 --> 00:32:18,240
- Thank you for the paint job.

428
00:32:18,284 --> 00:32:21,243
- I had no exact confirmation
that this is where you lived.

429
00:32:22,592 --> 00:32:24,681
I took a leap of
faith to be here.

430
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:27,380
You were the one
not writing me back.

431
00:32:27,423 --> 00:32:29,034
You were the one I couldn't
figure out how to call.

432
00:32:29,077 --> 00:32:30,557
That was on you.

433
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:34,561
- Okay, you can stay.

434
00:32:34,604 --> 00:32:37,042
But I will not
tolerate the lying.

435
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:40,523
What have I said to
you your entire life?

436
00:32:40,567 --> 00:32:43,570
The truth is more
important than the facts.

437
00:32:43,613 --> 00:32:46,921
- Yes, how great that
some things never change.

438
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:48,618
- No lying here.

439
00:32:48,662 --> 00:32:51,012
Not by Migo, not by me.

440
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:53,710
- Your dog doesn't lie?

441
00:32:53,754 --> 00:32:54,973
- It's a fact, Maggie.

442
00:32:58,628 --> 00:32:59,673
- Cool.

443
00:33:04,373 --> 00:33:09,291
[birds chirping]
[somber music]

444
00:33:09,335 --> 00:33:11,815
[Maggie sighs]

445
00:33:24,872 --> 00:33:26,569
Hi, Ben.

446
00:33:26,613 --> 00:33:30,138
I know that you'd probably

447
00:33:30,182 --> 00:33:32,575
like to hear something
from me, and...

448
00:33:39,756 --> 00:33:42,585
[phone buzzing]

449
00:33:46,763 --> 00:33:48,113
[Maggie groans]

450
00:33:48,156 --> 00:33:48,983
Come on.

451
00:33:50,202 --> 00:33:51,507
You wanna play?

452
00:33:54,728 --> 00:33:55,511
Come on.

453
00:34:03,606 --> 00:34:04,825
[Migo barking]

454
00:34:04,868 --> 00:34:06,218
Bring it back, bring
it back, bring it back.

455
00:34:06,261 --> 00:34:07,219
Migo!

456
00:34:07,262 --> 00:34:09,699
[Maggie whistles]

457
00:34:09,743 --> 00:34:10,918
One more time, hm?

458
00:34:13,007 --> 00:34:16,837
[Maggie yelps]
[Migo barks]

459
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:19,492
[guns firing]

460
00:34:27,021 --> 00:34:30,111
[Maggie whistles]

461
00:34:30,155 --> 00:34:32,766
[guns firing]

462
00:34:34,985 --> 00:34:35,769
Migo?

463
00:34:37,901 --> 00:34:38,685
Oh.

464
00:34:41,688 --> 00:34:42,819
Hey, hi.

465
00:34:44,647 --> 00:34:46,084
I'm looking for my dog.

466
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:48,086
Have you seen him?

467
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:51,524
Okay.

468
00:34:56,224 --> 00:34:57,704
[Maggie whistling]

469
00:34:57,747 --> 00:34:58,792
Migo!

470
00:35:01,795 --> 00:35:02,839
Migo!

471
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:05,886
Get over here!

472
00:35:07,627 --> 00:35:09,846
Do you know how long I've
been looking for you?

473
00:35:12,197 --> 00:35:13,981
You still have your ball, huh?

474
00:35:14,808 --> 00:35:16,853
You made me so worried.

475
00:35:17,941 --> 00:35:21,075
Come on, come on, come on.

476
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,903
Come on, come on.

477
00:35:46,231 --> 00:35:51,236
[frogs croaking]
[crickets chirping]

478
00:36:01,637 --> 00:36:03,378
I always knew you smoked.

479
00:36:03,422 --> 00:36:04,205
- Really?

480
00:36:05,685 --> 00:36:07,730
I thought I hid it pretty
well from you guys.

481
00:36:07,774 --> 00:36:12,779
- Are you kidding me?

482
00:36:13,954 --> 00:36:16,348
- My father, the preacher,

483
00:36:17,697 --> 00:36:21,614
he tried his damnedest to
keep me not smoking weed.

484
00:36:22,789 --> 00:36:25,792
Like every day I'd go to
school and he'd be like,

485
00:36:25,835 --> 00:36:26,880
"Don't smoke weed."

486
00:36:28,403 --> 00:36:31,928
So one time I went to him
and I wanted to borrow $20,

487
00:36:33,147 --> 00:36:35,889
and he said, "I'll
give you the 20

488
00:36:35,932 --> 00:36:37,151
"as long as you don't
spend it on marijuana,"

489
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:39,327
and I said, "That's
a deal, thanks Dad."

490
00:36:40,894 --> 00:36:43,244
Immediately went to my
friend Donkey's house,

491
00:36:44,811 --> 00:36:47,205
and we went and
bought a $20 bag.

492
00:36:48,815 --> 00:36:51,861
And we smoked so
much that we ended up

493
00:36:51,905 --> 00:36:56,692
feeding the rest of
it to his cat, Roscoe.

494
00:37:00,566 --> 00:37:02,481
- What happened to the cat?

495
00:37:02,524 --> 00:37:05,832
- The cat got so stoned
he attacked Donkey.

496
00:37:07,312 --> 00:37:11,141
Oh fuck, everybody ended
up at the hospital.

497
00:37:11,185 --> 00:37:16,190
Moral of the story is you can
learn a lot from your father.

498
00:37:24,416 --> 00:37:25,634
They're real, you know.

499
00:37:28,115 --> 00:37:29,203
The travelers.

500
00:37:32,989 --> 00:37:36,732
They don't have any aggression.

501
00:37:36,776 --> 00:37:38,343
They're so advanced beyond that.

502
00:37:39,866 --> 00:37:42,172
But they see the things
that we do down here.

503
00:37:43,696 --> 00:37:48,701
Ice caps melting, environmental
disasters, nuclear testing.

504
00:37:53,183 --> 00:37:55,925
There's war, starvation.

505
00:37:58,406 --> 00:38:00,278
They're just, they're
so beyond that.

506
00:38:01,714 --> 00:38:06,414
I can feel 'em, they
just want us to catch up.

507
00:38:07,633 --> 00:38:10,853
They want us to get
past those obstacles.

508
00:38:16,946 --> 00:38:17,730
Yeah.

509
00:38:21,342 --> 00:38:23,344
- That's nice to think about.

510
00:38:23,388 --> 00:38:24,780
- If they had
hostile intentions,

511
00:38:24,824 --> 00:38:26,304
I think we wouldn't be here.

512
00:38:27,479 --> 00:38:29,394
They'd have taken
over a long time ago.

513
00:38:32,832 --> 00:38:33,876
- Dad.

514
00:38:35,965 --> 00:38:37,315
You're an engineer.
- Yeah.

515
00:38:41,014 --> 00:38:45,061
- Not um, a conspiracy theorist.

516
00:38:46,976 --> 00:38:49,022
- What a buzzkill.
- I'm sorry.

517
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,942
- So what are you doing here?

518
00:38:55,985 --> 00:38:56,769
- I told you.

519
00:39:00,990 --> 00:39:02,035
- Yes?

520
00:39:04,298 --> 00:39:05,081
- I guess,

521
00:39:07,867 --> 00:39:09,651
I guess in a way,

522
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:12,872
I kind of ran away from home.

523
00:39:14,003 --> 00:39:17,006
- Okay, that's a start.

524
00:39:18,443 --> 00:39:20,880
- [Maggie] Kind of just
wanted to, you know,

525
00:39:20,923 --> 00:39:22,882
get away from it
all, for a moment.

526
00:39:26,799 --> 00:39:27,887
Yeah.

527
00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:31,847
- So, is that getting
away from it all

528
00:39:31,891 --> 00:39:33,762
for a moment involve Ben?

529
00:39:34,894 --> 00:39:36,852
- I just needed some time.

530
00:39:36,896 --> 00:39:40,465
Time to myself.
- That's pretty vague.

531
00:39:40,508 --> 00:39:42,118
- Look, sometimes
you're in a place,

532
00:39:42,162 --> 00:39:43,642
and you're being asked
all these questions

533
00:39:43,685 --> 00:39:46,819
you don't know the
answer to, constantly.

534
00:39:46,862 --> 00:39:48,864
- Ben?
- Mm-hmm.

535
00:39:48,908 --> 00:39:51,998
- Jamin, Benjamin.

536
00:39:52,041 --> 00:39:55,218
- Oh my god, I didn't
understand what you...

537
00:39:55,262 --> 00:39:58,091
[Maggie laughs]

538
00:39:58,874 --> 00:40:00,049
- I'm fuckin' stoned.

539
00:40:03,792 --> 00:40:05,185
- That's nice.

540
00:40:05,228 --> 00:40:08,580
- Well, he seems
like a good guy.

541
00:40:09,798 --> 00:40:10,799
- He's a good guy.

542
00:40:12,105 --> 00:40:13,149
- Good.

543
00:40:13,933 --> 00:40:15,413
Then you can figure it out.

544
00:40:17,371 --> 00:40:22,028
- And until I do,
I can just be here.

545
00:40:24,987 --> 00:40:26,206
- I was here first.

546
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:32,081
- Yeah, well.

547
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:40,089
[engine roaring]
- Acidman, Acidman!

548
00:40:40,133 --> 00:40:41,264
- What?
- Goddamnit.

549
00:40:41,308 --> 00:40:42,788
- [Teen] Acidman!

550
00:40:44,964 --> 00:40:47,749
- [Teen] You gotta say his
name three times to summon him!

551
00:40:47,793 --> 00:40:49,055
- Acidman!
- Dad?

552
00:40:49,098 --> 00:40:51,013
Dad, what are you doing?
- Kids.

553
00:40:51,057 --> 00:40:53,059
- Dad, Dad, no!

554
00:40:53,102 --> 00:40:54,887
Hey, hey!
- Get outta here!

555
00:40:54,930 --> 00:40:56,454
- Dad.
- Sons of bitches.

556
00:40:56,497 --> 00:40:58,412
- Yeah, you dumbass!
[gun fires]

557
00:40:58,456 --> 00:40:59,848
- Dad, Jesus Christ!
[gun fires]

558
00:40:59,892 --> 00:41:01,067
What are you doing?

559
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:02,372
- See ya, bitch!

560
00:41:02,416 --> 00:41:07,421
- What the hell?

561
00:41:08,553 --> 00:41:11,251
Dad, you can't shoot
at fucking kids.

562
00:41:11,294 --> 00:41:13,427
- I didn't shoot at the kids,

563
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:15,385
I fired a warning shot.

564
00:41:15,429 --> 00:41:17,257
- [Maggie] Same thing.

565
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:20,826
- But, if I'd wanted to
hit one of 'em, I could've.

566
00:41:20,869 --> 00:41:21,870
I'm pretty good.

567
00:41:24,699 --> 00:41:26,005
What'd you wanna do,

568
00:41:26,048 --> 00:41:28,268
hang out in the back of
the truck like a pussy?

569
00:41:28,311 --> 00:41:30,052
- [Maggie] You
can't say that, Dad.

570
00:41:31,184 --> 00:41:33,099
- [Lloyd] What, to a woman?

571
00:41:33,142 --> 00:41:34,056
- [Maggie] Jesus.

572
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:38,452
[crickets chirping]

573
00:41:43,892 --> 00:41:47,156
[tea kettle whistling]

574
00:41:51,247 --> 00:41:52,248
- You ready?

575
00:41:52,292 --> 00:41:53,423
It's gonna be a great night.

576
00:41:53,467 --> 00:41:55,034
Super clear skies, beautiful.

577
00:41:56,296 --> 00:41:58,167
- Do you mind if I
sit this one out?

578
00:41:58,211 --> 00:41:59,386
- Sure.

579
00:41:59,429 --> 00:42:02,041
- I'm just, really tired.
- Okay.

580
00:42:03,042 --> 00:42:04,826
- Happy hunting.

581
00:42:04,870 --> 00:42:06,393
- I prefer to call it searching.

582
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:09,135
- Can't tell if
you're serious or not.

583
00:42:11,137 --> 00:42:13,574
- You know, Maggie, I don't
know that I've ever been

584
00:42:13,618 --> 00:42:15,315
more serious about anything.

585
00:42:16,838 --> 00:42:20,450
There's a global community
of research scientists,

586
00:42:20,494 --> 00:42:23,845
engineers, experts like myself,

587
00:42:23,889 --> 00:42:26,848
that have studied
communication and physics

588
00:42:26,892 --> 00:42:29,851
to be able to reach
out into the cosmos.

589
00:42:29,895 --> 00:42:33,202
But what it's really about
is to connect with them.

590
00:42:33,246 --> 00:42:35,857
They're out there
traveling the galaxy.

591
00:42:35,901 --> 00:42:38,164
They're looking at
hundreds of worlds,

592
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:41,733
and they still come here,
to check on our planet,

593
00:42:41,776 --> 00:42:43,125
to make sure we're okay.

594
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:46,651
And I think I do
have a personal goal,

595
00:42:46,694 --> 00:42:48,914
and an obligation
to say thank you.

596
00:42:48,957 --> 00:42:55,573
- Well... I can thank them
with you another night.

597
00:42:57,313 --> 00:42:58,837
- Okay.

598
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:00,273
- [Maggie] Happy searching.

599
00:43:03,624 --> 00:43:05,713
- [Ben] <i>It'd be a lot easier</i><i>
if we could just talk.</i>

600
00:43:05,757 --> 00:43:11,284
<i>Anything, just call me when</i><i>
you're ready, all right.</i>

601
00:43:31,826 --> 00:43:32,610
- Dad?

602
00:43:35,134 --> 00:43:36,918
Dad, are you okay?

603
00:43:38,572 --> 00:43:39,355
Dad.

604
00:43:41,401 --> 00:43:42,228
What's going on?

605
00:43:44,709 --> 00:43:46,014
- The truck won't start.

606
00:43:48,277 --> 00:43:49,670
- [Maggie] Okay.

607
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:56,198
What is it, battery or?

608
00:43:59,462 --> 00:44:00,855
- The truck won't start.

609
00:44:03,379 --> 00:44:04,163
- Okay.

610
00:44:11,344 --> 00:44:12,388
That's okay.

611
00:44:14,695 --> 00:44:15,914
Dad, when was it that you-

612
00:44:15,957 --> 00:44:18,046
- I'm sorry, the
truck won't start.

613
00:44:18,090 --> 00:44:20,701
- [Maggie] I get
that, but that's okay.

614
00:44:20,745 --> 00:44:21,571
It's okay.

615
00:44:22,485 --> 00:44:23,486
I can drive you.

616
00:44:23,530 --> 00:44:25,271
- I don't know what's wrong.

617
00:44:25,314 --> 00:44:26,359
I don't know what's
wrong with it.

618
00:44:26,402 --> 00:44:27,534
- It's fine.
- It just won't start.

619
00:44:27,577 --> 00:44:29,710
- Let me drive you.
- No, I'd rather walk.

620
00:44:31,364 --> 00:44:33,758
- Dad.
- Have a good night.

621
00:44:33,801 --> 00:44:36,804
[crickets chirping]

622
00:44:37,936 --> 00:44:40,329
[eerie music]

623
00:45:20,021 --> 00:45:22,720
[birds chirping]

624
00:45:26,985 --> 00:45:29,248
Moving in a formation.

625
00:45:29,291 --> 00:45:30,902
Moving in a formation.

626
00:45:30,945 --> 00:45:33,165
I made a bit of a contact.

627
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:35,515
Hi, hi.
- Hey.

628
00:45:35,558 --> 00:45:38,126
- You gotta check this
out, you gotta see this.

629
00:45:38,170 --> 00:45:41,129
This happened
early this morning.

630
00:45:41,173 --> 00:45:42,304
- Did you just get home?
- Yeah.

631
00:45:42,348 --> 00:45:43,610
- Aren't you tired?

632
00:45:43,653 --> 00:45:45,481
- No, no, no, I'm
good, I'm good.

633
00:45:45,525 --> 00:45:47,266
- Okay.
- Yeah.

634
00:45:47,309 --> 00:45:48,397
Here, watch.

635
00:45:48,441 --> 00:45:50,617
It's incontrovertible evidence.

636
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:53,228
This is the place,
here at the reservoir.

637
00:45:53,272 --> 00:45:54,577
You see what's happening?

638
00:45:55,535 --> 00:45:56,797
- Yeah, I've seen this one.

639
00:45:56,841 --> 00:45:59,452
- No, no, no, this
was this morning.

640
00:45:59,495 --> 00:46:00,453
So there's a pattern.

641
00:46:00,496 --> 00:46:02,368
They're signaling in a pattern.

642
00:46:02,411 --> 00:46:03,195
Do you see it?

643
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:05,284
Watch the lights.

644
00:46:07,416 --> 00:46:10,463
Three, two, one,

645
00:46:10,506 --> 00:46:11,681
and then it recycles.

646
00:46:11,725 --> 00:46:13,422
We're signaling in threes.

647
00:46:13,466 --> 00:46:16,556
Was that a flash, flash flash,

648
00:46:16,599 --> 00:46:17,470
and then flash flash flash.

649
00:46:17,513 --> 00:46:19,385
So we gotta come back here.

650
00:46:19,428 --> 00:46:20,821
- Sequencing of three.

651
00:46:20,865 --> 00:46:23,345
- Yes, yes, exactly.

652
00:46:23,389 --> 00:46:24,433
It's amazing, huh?

653
00:46:25,695 --> 00:46:26,784
- Uh huh.

654
00:46:26,827 --> 00:46:28,829
What do you think?

655
00:46:28,873 --> 00:46:32,093
- It's so much to
think about, you know?

656
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:34,661
- This is just fantastic.

657
00:46:34,704 --> 00:46:37,969
They wanna make
contact in two days.

658
00:46:38,012 --> 00:46:40,623
You know what, I'm
gonna need your help.

659
00:46:40,667 --> 00:46:41,886
I've been working on something,

660
00:46:41,929 --> 00:46:43,191
and now I've gotta ramp it up

661
00:46:43,235 --> 00:46:44,932
to make this two
day window, okay?

662
00:46:44,976 --> 00:46:46,281
Are you with me?

663
00:46:46,325 --> 00:46:47,413
Come on, come on.

664
00:46:49,328 --> 00:46:50,459
It's out in the woods.

665
00:46:52,026 --> 00:46:53,375
So, you might spot a couple

666
00:46:53,419 --> 00:46:55,508
of those other cherry
bark maples in here.

667
00:46:56,422 --> 00:46:57,858
I've seen a few in this area.

668
00:46:57,902 --> 00:46:59,381
- I thought you said
there was only one,

669
00:46:59,425 --> 00:47:00,905
and it was the one
that we planted.

670
00:47:00,948 --> 00:47:03,472
- Yeah, it's a special one,
because we planted that one.

671
00:47:03,516 --> 00:47:04,865
These others are volunteers,

672
00:47:04,909 --> 00:47:07,825
so it's like they're
the friends of our tree.

673
00:47:07,868 --> 00:47:08,782
[Maggie laughs]

674
00:47:08,826 --> 00:47:09,609
Yeah.

675
00:47:11,437 --> 00:47:12,220
This is it.

676
00:47:13,569 --> 00:47:15,354
I mean, I know it
doesn't look like much,

677
00:47:15,397 --> 00:47:17,008
but it's a work in progress.

678
00:47:17,051 --> 00:47:18,400
- Another one of your projects?

679
00:47:18,444 --> 00:47:20,446
- Yeah, yeah.

680
00:47:20,489 --> 00:47:23,536
Yeah, this is the
grand communicator.

681
00:47:23,579 --> 00:47:25,625
Well, it's a stupid name,

682
00:47:25,668 --> 00:47:28,193
but you'll come up with
something better, I think.

683
00:47:28,236 --> 00:47:29,107
I thought I told you about this.

684
00:47:29,150 --> 00:47:30,456
Did I tell you about this?

685
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:32,371
You okay?

686
00:47:32,414 --> 00:47:33,981
- Just not fully following.

687
00:47:34,025 --> 00:47:37,550
- Well, okay, you remember
Sedona, Fourth of July?

688
00:47:37,593 --> 00:47:38,464
- Yes.

689
00:47:38,507 --> 00:47:39,378
- That was just fun and games.

690
00:47:39,421 --> 00:47:40,901
This is gonna be,

691
00:47:44,470 --> 00:47:45,601
10 times as big?

692
00:47:47,821 --> 00:47:49,823
- And you're doing all of this?

693
00:47:49,867 --> 00:47:52,304
- To communicate, with them.

694
00:47:54,567 --> 00:47:57,439
- Uh, do you remember Sedona?

695
00:47:57,483 --> 00:47:59,702
- Yeah, yeah it was great.

696
00:47:59,746 --> 00:48:01,139
- Four fire trucks.

697
00:48:02,401 --> 00:48:04,577
- [Lloyd] Yeah, but
Maggie, nobody got hurt.

698
00:48:04,620 --> 00:48:06,144
- Mom's eyebrows
were singed off.

699
00:48:08,798 --> 00:48:10,452
- I told her to get back.

700
00:48:10,496 --> 00:48:11,410
- Dad.

701
00:48:11,453 --> 00:48:12,715
- Maggie.
- What?

702
00:48:12,759 --> 00:48:13,978
- I don't think you
completely understand

703
00:48:14,021 --> 00:48:16,545
the enormity of
what I have to do.

704
00:48:16,589 --> 00:48:19,157
I have no choice but to respond.

705
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:20,506
This is what it takes.

706
00:48:20,549 --> 00:48:22,116
- I'm gonna go on record and say

707
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:27,121
that I think this is really
fucking dangerous, and crazy.

708
00:48:27,992 --> 00:48:30,559
I mean, look at how much...

709
00:48:31,473 --> 00:48:33,084
- Crazy?

710
00:48:33,127 --> 00:48:34,607
- I didn't call you crazy.

711
00:48:34,650 --> 00:48:38,437
I'm just saying this is crazy.
- You called this crazy.

712
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:39,612
You know what, Maggie?

713
00:48:40,787 --> 00:48:43,311
I tried to bring you
in on something bigger.

714
00:48:43,355 --> 00:48:44,573
Something bigger
than you and me,

715
00:48:44,617 --> 00:48:46,227
bigger than human civilization.

716
00:48:47,489 --> 00:48:49,752
And you turn out to be just
like the fucking idiots

717
00:48:49,796 --> 00:48:52,451
that I used to work with,
those engineering pricks!

718
00:48:52,494 --> 00:48:54,540
And your mother,
and your brother,

719
00:48:54,583 --> 00:48:56,542
and your grandparents.

720
00:48:56,585 --> 00:48:58,283
Nobody could ever support me

721
00:48:58,326 --> 00:49:01,112
in anything that I had
to do that was important.

722
00:49:01,155 --> 00:49:02,330
You know what they are?

723
00:49:03,723 --> 00:49:06,595
They're cynics, they're
skeptics, they're traitors.

724
00:49:10,730 --> 00:49:12,253
Are you a traitor, Maggie?

725
00:49:17,258 --> 00:49:19,565
- I can't do this with you.

726
00:49:20,522 --> 00:49:21,306
- Yeah.

727
00:49:23,134 --> 00:49:25,484
I gotta go into town
and get more supplies.

728
00:49:26,789 --> 00:49:28,443
Don't be here when I get back.

729
00:49:29,357 --> 00:49:32,056

[Migo whining]

734
00:50:39,123 --> 00:50:40,820
- Shit, shit, shit, no, no, no.

735
00:50:40,863 --> 00:50:43,040
Hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey,

736
00:50:43,083 --> 00:50:45,520
stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

737
00:50:45,564 --> 00:50:47,957
Oh, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

738
00:50:50,308 --> 00:50:52,527
Oh, okay, oh no.

739
00:51:01,667 --> 00:51:03,712
You're gonna be fine, boy.

740
00:51:03,756 --> 00:51:04,800
You're gonna be fine.

741
00:51:07,107 --> 00:51:09,588
[horn honking]

742
00:51:14,897 --> 00:51:17,248
- [Lloyd] That's good,
that's good, Migo.

743
00:51:17,291 --> 00:51:18,510
- Dad, how's he doing?

744
00:51:20,555 --> 00:51:21,643
This isn't updating.

745
00:51:22,905 --> 00:51:25,430
Oh, this shitty
fucking reception.

746
00:51:26,779 --> 00:51:29,173
I'm so, so sorry, I'm so sorry.

747
00:51:29,216 --> 00:51:30,609
I should've been watching you.

748
00:51:30,652 --> 00:51:34,178
Dad, I'm so sorry,
I'm so sorry, okay?

749
00:51:35,092 --> 00:51:36,571
Migo.

750
00:51:36,615 --> 00:51:39,226
Migo, I'm so sorry.

751
00:51:39,270 --> 00:51:41,576
- [Lloyd] Take a left up
here, it's a shortcut.

752
00:51:41,620 --> 00:51:42,534
- Dad, it says to turn right.

753
00:51:42,577 --> 00:51:43,796
- I know where we're going.

754
00:51:43,839 --> 00:51:45,189
- You sure?
- Yes.

755
00:51:48,366 --> 00:51:50,411
- Dad, where are we going?

756
00:51:50,455 --> 00:51:51,586
- Just drive straight.

757
00:51:57,766 --> 00:52:02,771
[Migo whining]
[Maggie sobbing]

758
00:52:06,775 --> 00:52:09,778
There's a left up
here, just stop there.

759
00:52:16,045 --> 00:52:17,786
Yeah, this is good.

760
00:52:25,359 --> 00:52:27,274
It's not your fault, Maggie.

761
00:52:32,192 --> 00:52:34,847
[wind whooshing]

00:53:09,273 --> 00:53:11,710

[shovel scraping]

765
00:54:25,392 --> 00:54:27,089
You know, your grandfather,

766
00:54:29,396 --> 00:54:30,702
Methodist minister.

767
00:54:33,705 --> 00:54:36,055
Sat next to hundreds,

768
00:54:38,579 --> 00:54:41,234
I don't know how
many, people dying.

769
00:54:44,368 --> 00:54:47,153
And they always wanted to
hear the same words from him.

770
00:54:48,633 --> 00:54:50,983
That they were going
on to a greater reward.

771
00:54:52,985 --> 00:54:55,988
And he'd tell 'em exactly
what they wanted to hear.

772
00:55:01,210 --> 00:55:04,823
Last time I saw him, he
wanted me to tell him

773
00:55:04,866 --> 00:55:06,955
that there was a great reward,

774
00:55:09,001 --> 00:55:10,481
but I knew he didn't believe it.

775
00:55:11,917 --> 00:55:14,833
And I sure as shit wasn't gonna
stand there and lie to him.

776
00:55:16,008 --> 00:55:17,270
- Why are you doing this?

777
00:55:17,314 --> 00:55:19,228
- It's the only time I
ever saw my father cry.

778
00:55:24,233 --> 00:55:25,931
He was just a scared old man.

779
00:55:30,022 --> 00:55:32,894
And I just said, "It's
gonna be over soon,"

780
00:55:37,072 --> 00:55:38,335
and then I said goodbye.

781
00:55:45,516 --> 00:55:48,040
[Maggie sighs]

782
00:55:52,087 --> 00:55:53,872
- We could've been so different,

783
00:55:55,961 --> 00:55:56,744
as a family.

784
00:55:59,834 --> 00:56:03,925
There was so much love there,
and support, and I felt safe.

785
00:56:06,101 --> 00:56:10,584
And then, you sat us down,

786
00:56:12,934 --> 00:56:16,677
and told Bucky
and I that we were

787
00:56:19,114 --> 00:56:22,640
old enough, and didn't
need you anymore.

788
00:56:29,124 --> 00:56:31,257
Is there anything that
could've made you stay?

789
00:56:43,922 --> 00:56:45,489
That's good to know.

790
00:56:46,925 --> 00:56:48,927
I spent a lot of time...

791
00:56:53,888 --> 00:56:56,804
I wanted you so badly.

792
00:56:56,848 --> 00:56:58,632
I had things I
wanted to ask you,

793
00:56:58,676 --> 00:57:01,026
and not Mom, and not
Bucky, and not...

794
00:57:05,117 --> 00:57:06,248
Oh, fuck.

795
00:57:08,076 --> 00:57:12,690
And the thing is is
that I am, I'm you!

796
00:57:12,733 --> 00:57:13,908
I am you.

797
00:57:13,952 --> 00:57:14,909
I do the same things.

798
00:57:14,953 --> 00:57:16,041
In fact,

799
00:57:19,261 --> 00:57:22,787
I leave quicker, ugh.

800
00:57:31,796 --> 00:57:34,189
I left without telling
him that I was leaving.

801
00:57:45,287 --> 00:57:46,637
Why are we like that?

802
00:57:54,340 --> 00:57:55,123
Dad?

803
00:57:59,563 --> 00:58:00,346
Dad.

804
00:58:07,527 --> 00:58:10,095
Have you heard any of this, Dad?

805
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:21,280
[Maggie sniffles]

806
00:58:22,847 --> 00:58:25,458

[guns firing]

810
00:59:03,496 --> 00:59:04,279
- Fuckers.

811
00:59:07,544 --> 00:59:09,110
Hey!

812
00:59:09,154 --> 00:59:10,677
Do you sons of bitches even
know whose land you're on?

813
00:59:10,721 --> 00:59:12,287
- No, no, this is public.
- Do you?

814
00:59:12,331 --> 00:59:13,898
Oh yeah, fuck you!

815
00:59:13,941 --> 00:59:16,422
I'm gonna report you to
the sheriff's department.

816
00:59:16,465 --> 00:59:19,294
You are fucking poaching, god!

Hey!

Hey!

820
00:59:25,213 --> 00:59:27,346
You come back here!

00:59:27,389 --> 00:59:28,173
Hey!

822
00:59:32,830 --> 00:59:33,613
Hey!

823
00:59:35,659 --> 00:59:37,312
You killed my dog!

824
00:59:41,186 --> 00:59:42,840
You killed my dog.

[silverware clinking]

827
01:00:16,134 --> 01:00:17,614
- [Charlie] Hey, you're
doing good with that.

828
01:00:17,657 --> 01:00:21,792
- [Maggie] What's both difficult
and easy at the same time?

829
01:00:21,835 --> 01:00:23,228
- Say when.
- Huh?

830
01:00:23,271 --> 01:00:26,666
[whipped cream hissing]

831
01:00:32,803 --> 01:00:34,108
- Please say when.

832
01:00:34,152 --> 01:00:35,283
Say it, oh my.

833
01:00:36,807 --> 01:00:39,679
- That is a beautiful whipped
cream mountain, I love it.

834
01:00:39,723 --> 01:00:40,462
- Enjoy it.

835
01:00:41,507 --> 01:00:42,247
- Mm.

836
01:00:46,381 --> 01:00:47,121
Mm.

837
01:00:50,603 --> 01:00:52,257
What's the secret in the sauce?

838
01:00:52,300 --> 01:00:53,475
- No way.

839
01:00:53,519 --> 01:00:54,607
It stays in the vault.

840
01:00:55,913 --> 01:00:57,523
It's for my kids.

841
01:00:57,566 --> 01:00:58,785
- I'll befriend them,

842
01:00:58,829 --> 01:01:00,091
and they'll give me
all your secrets.

843
01:01:00,134 --> 01:01:03,268
- No way, but they
would love you,

844
01:01:03,311 --> 01:01:04,878
so you'll have to meet them.

845
01:01:05,879 --> 01:01:07,620
- What are they like?

846
01:01:07,664 --> 01:01:10,579
- They're cool, you know?

847
01:01:10,623 --> 01:01:13,757
Darren, my youngest,
is a handful.

848
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:15,715
He thinks very
highly of himself.

849
01:01:15,759 --> 01:01:17,195
[Maggie laughs]

850
01:01:17,238 --> 01:01:21,329
And Phillip is just a raw nerve.

851
01:01:21,373 --> 01:01:24,811
He is just all
emotion, all the time.

852
01:01:24,855 --> 01:01:26,813
He's a teenager, it's beautiful.

853
01:01:27,771 --> 01:01:29,163
I wouldn't change a thing.

854
01:01:30,295 --> 01:01:31,296
Well, that's bullshit.

855
01:01:31,339 --> 01:01:32,166
I would change,

856
01:01:34,516 --> 01:01:35,561
I would change a lot.

857
01:01:39,434 --> 01:01:40,435
But not them.

858
01:01:42,307 --> 01:01:45,223
- Big act of faith, having kids.

859
01:01:47,312 --> 01:01:51,359
To be confident that
you're gonna figure it out.

860
01:01:53,274 --> 01:01:54,798
Try not to make mistakes,

861
01:01:54,841 --> 01:01:57,278
try not to make the mistakes
that your parents made.

862
01:01:59,628 --> 01:02:00,499
Lot of stuff.

863
01:02:02,283 --> 01:02:04,024
I'd imagine, you know?

[Maggie sniffling]

867
01:04:41,790 --> 01:04:42,574
Hello.

868
01:04:44,445 --> 01:04:48,058
Dad, smile.

869
01:04:49,450 --> 01:04:50,234
Dad.

870
01:04:52,758 --> 01:04:53,802
Whoa!

871
01:04:56,457 --> 01:04:58,285
Very good, look at the ripples.

872
01:04:59,547 --> 01:05:00,505
- [Lloyd] Do you remember
when I taught you Morse code

873
01:05:00,548 --> 01:05:01,593
when you were little?

874
01:05:02,463 --> 01:05:03,247
Yep.

875
01:05:06,511 --> 01:05:08,948
Wait there, yeah,
kind of tilt it down.

876
01:05:08,992 --> 01:05:10,907
There you go,
there's a little bit.

877
01:05:13,126 --> 01:05:13,910
That's good.

878
01:05:15,085 --> 01:05:18,044
Try to do a series
of three dots,

879
01:05:18,958 --> 01:05:21,439
two dashes, and three dots.

880
01:05:24,485 --> 01:05:25,834
- How do you do a dash?

881
01:05:25,878 --> 01:05:30,143
- [Lloyd] It's just a
longer flip of the mirror.

882
01:05:33,016 --> 01:05:33,842
Good.

883
01:05:35,322 --> 01:05:38,064
Now, unfortunately you
just called 'em assholes.

884
01:05:38,108 --> 01:05:39,457
[Maggie laughs]

885
01:05:39,500 --> 01:05:41,763
- [Maggie] What was I
like when I was a baby?

886
01:05:44,636 --> 01:05:46,464
- You never cried.
- No?

887
01:05:47,465 --> 01:05:49,597
- Usually 'cause you had
a pillow over your face.

888
01:05:49,641 --> 01:05:51,512
[both laugh]

889
01:05:51,556 --> 01:05:52,644
Oh, you were a sweet baby.

890
01:05:53,819 --> 01:05:56,387
I used to call you Maggie Bear.

891
01:05:57,388 --> 01:05:58,258
- [Maggie] Why?

892
01:05:58,302 --> 01:05:59,477
- Your poops were the size of-

893
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:01,609
- [Maggie] Oh my
god, Dad, disgusting!

894
01:06:01,653 --> 01:06:03,568
[Maggie laughs]

895
01:06:03,611 --> 01:06:06,266
[birds chirping]

896
01:06:09,791 --> 01:06:11,619
- [Lloyd] Here's your eggs.

897
01:06:11,663 --> 01:06:12,533
- Thank you.

898
01:06:12,577 --> 01:06:13,882
- Just the way I like 'em.

899
01:06:15,319 --> 01:06:17,582
So basically, we're just
gonna be sending their signal

900
01:06:17,625 --> 01:06:18,887
back to them.

901
01:06:18,931 --> 01:06:20,454
It's repetition, it's mimicry,

902
01:06:20,498 --> 01:06:23,153
it's the most fundamental
form of communication.

903
01:06:23,196 --> 01:06:24,415
- Okay.

904
01:06:24,458 --> 01:06:25,807
- Remember the first
night we were out there,

905
01:06:25,851 --> 01:06:27,592
and you saw the hovering lights,

906
01:06:27,635 --> 01:06:29,246
and thought it was an airplane?

907
01:06:29,289 --> 01:06:31,030
Through the filter
in the camera,

908
01:06:31,074 --> 01:06:33,641
I could see what their
color sequencing was.

909
01:06:33,685 --> 01:06:36,470
So, we're just gonna
be sending that back.

910
01:06:36,514 --> 01:06:38,124
Green, white, blue, red.

911
01:06:39,734 --> 01:06:41,084
Pretty basic.
- Yeah?

912
01:06:42,346 --> 01:06:44,217
- Yeah, you just, you
wanna acknowledge 'em,

913
01:06:44,261 --> 01:06:46,350
and then you start talking back.

914
01:06:46,393 --> 01:06:48,787
How's it going, do
you come in peace?

915
01:06:48,830 --> 01:06:50,180
That sort of thing.

916
01:06:50,223 --> 01:06:53,183
- In that order?
- Yeah, yeah in that order.

917
01:06:53,226 --> 01:06:55,837
I don't, you know, speak alien.

918
01:06:56,751 --> 01:06:57,535
Not yet.

919
01:06:58,753 --> 01:07:00,581
Okay, did you see
the way I did that?

920
01:07:01,669 --> 01:07:02,801
See the wires?

921
01:07:02,844 --> 01:07:06,239
Green, green, white, white,

922
01:07:06,283 --> 01:07:08,285
blue, blue, red, red.

923
01:07:09,242 --> 01:07:10,026
That's it.

924
01:07:11,201 --> 01:07:12,767
I need about 100 more.

Hey, grab that box.

928
01:07:29,175 --> 01:07:31,656
- This is very heavy, you know.

929
01:07:31,699 --> 01:07:33,440
Can't I just leave it?

930
01:07:33,484 --> 01:07:34,876
Dad, oh, oh!

931
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:36,530
- [Lloyd] I don't want
to get too close.

932
01:07:36,574 --> 01:07:38,097
- Ow.

933
01:07:38,141 --> 01:07:38,924
- Give me.

934
01:07:38,967 --> 01:07:39,707
[Maggie grunts]

935
01:07:39,751 --> 01:07:41,579
This isn't that heavy.

[both grunt]

937
01:07:45,626 --> 01:07:48,064
Check position 11.

938
01:07:48,107 --> 01:07:49,456
- [Maggie] Which one's 11?

939
01:07:51,893 --> 01:07:54,635
- Thought about what
you said the other day.

940
01:07:54,679 --> 01:07:55,723
- Mm-hmm?

941
01:08:00,163 --> 01:08:03,601
- Just in case something
goes wrong, you know?

942
01:08:03,644 --> 01:08:04,645
- It's not gonna do shit.

943
01:08:04,689 --> 01:08:06,343
- It's a joke.
- I get it.

944
01:08:08,954 --> 01:08:10,608
- We better check
those sequences.

945
01:08:10,651 --> 01:08:12,784
- Okay, one's a go.

946
01:08:12,827 --> 01:08:15,700
- Make sure the firing
trigger is off right now.

947
01:08:16,831 --> 01:08:18,877
- Four's a go, five's a go,

948
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:21,532
six, seven.

949
01:08:22,750 --> 01:08:25,797
So what, they're just
gonna show up or something?

950
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:27,364
- [Lloyd] Listen, we
have to signal them

951
01:08:27,407 --> 01:08:28,713
when the moment is right.

952
01:08:29,714 --> 01:08:31,716
- I can't tell what
part of you is real.

953
01:08:38,462 --> 01:08:40,116
- You're not like me.

954
01:08:42,466 --> 01:08:43,206
That's real.

955
01:08:46,470 --> 01:08:47,949
You're willing to stick it out.

956
01:08:49,864 --> 01:08:51,431
And you're always were.

957
01:08:51,475 --> 01:08:52,389
- What do you mean?

958
01:08:53,999 --> 01:08:59,004
- That little girl, you
just had such dedication.

959
01:09:02,312 --> 01:09:04,314
You're just a little
bit lost right now.

960
01:09:07,230 --> 01:09:08,796
Whatever you decide to do,

961
01:09:10,146 --> 01:09:11,451
don't do what I did.

962
01:09:13,410 --> 01:09:14,759
Don't throw it all away.

963
01:09:15,890 --> 01:09:18,589
[frogs croaking]

964
01:09:22,897 --> 01:09:25,857
If it's a girl, you should
think about the name Jacqueline.

965
01:09:27,467 --> 01:09:28,947
It's what I wanted to name you.

966
01:09:31,471 --> 01:09:32,211
- What?

967
01:09:32,255 --> 01:09:33,430
- Still like that name.

968
01:09:36,084 --> 01:09:37,956
- Dad, how did you know?

969
01:09:37,999 --> 01:09:40,698
- You're gonna be a
great mother, Maggie.

970
01:09:40,741 --> 01:09:43,527
[emotional music]

971
01:09:47,705 --> 01:09:49,097
Get ready.
- What?

972
01:09:53,014 --> 01:09:53,798
- [Lloyd] Hit it.

973
01:09:53,841 --> 01:09:55,234
- Now?
- Now!

974
01:09:55,278 --> 01:09:56,061
- Okay!

Dad.

990
01:11:31,983 --> 01:11:32,766
Dad?

[crickets chirping]
[frogs croaking]

992
01:11:43,211 --> 01:11:44,996
- Guess they
decided not to show.

993
01:11:51,045 --> 01:11:52,308
Yeah, fuckers.

Couldn't sleep,
been up all night.

997
01:14:34,644 --> 01:14:38,517
It's just their
communication is so complex.

998
01:14:38,561 --> 01:14:42,042
Just gotta try and figure
out where I went wrong.

999
01:14:42,086 --> 01:14:45,655
I just gotta think bigger,
and do better math.

1000
01:14:46,699 --> 01:14:48,222
I just gotta keep going with it.

1001
01:14:51,138 --> 01:14:56,056
- I know it's early,
but any new theories?

1002
01:14:56,579 --> 01:14:57,797
- Yes, I do.

1003
01:14:57,841 --> 01:15:00,278
Have you ever heard
of extended binary

1004
01:15:00,321 --> 01:15:03,107
coded decimal interchange code?

1005
01:15:03,150 --> 01:15:04,325
- That's a mouthful.

1006
01:15:05,413 --> 01:15:07,894
- It's EBCDIC.

1007
01:15:07,938 --> 01:15:11,811
It's an eight bit code
capable of 256 characters,

1008
01:15:11,855 --> 01:15:15,902
and a variety of eight
bit combinations,

1009
01:15:15,946 --> 01:15:19,036
but I think, given the precision

1010
01:15:19,079 --> 01:15:21,299
of the code and the numerics,

1011
01:15:22,474 --> 01:15:25,216
might be able to break
through with them.

1012
01:15:29,220 --> 01:15:30,743
- Any idea on timing?

1013
01:15:32,745 --> 01:15:35,052
[ sighs]

1014
01:15:35,095 --> 01:15:38,925
- July, I think, maybe?
- Yeah?

1015
01:15:38,969 --> 01:15:39,752
- Yeah.

1016
01:15:41,449 --> 01:15:43,016
Yeah, I think July.
- Okay.

1017
01:15:44,191 --> 01:15:46,672
No specific date
in July, just July?

1018
01:15:47,847 --> 01:15:48,631
- No.

1019
01:15:50,197 --> 01:15:51,938
What are you doing?

1020
01:15:51,982 --> 01:15:55,333
- Just making a note
to circle back with you

1021
01:15:55,376 --> 01:15:58,118
about specific dates.

1022
01:15:58,162 --> 01:15:59,816
- That's great.

1023
01:15:59,859 --> 01:16:01,121
But I gotta be honest,

1024
01:16:01,165 --> 01:16:04,908
I think that maybe the
color coding was wrong.

1025
01:16:04,951 --> 01:16:06,300
- That's okay.

1026
01:16:06,344 --> 01:16:10,435
I mean, maybe the color
coding, sequencing,

1027
01:16:11,479 --> 01:16:12,959
maybe it's not important.

1028
01:16:13,003 --> 01:16:15,614
- Exactly, that's exactly
what I was thinking.

1029
01:16:15,658 --> 01:16:18,617
I'm just gonna go back to the
fundamentals of communication.

1030
01:16:18,661 --> 01:16:20,314
Well, we talked
about that before.

1031
01:16:22,578 --> 01:16:25,058
Hey, wait, in July?

1032
01:16:26,451 --> 01:16:27,321
- Mm-hmm.

1033
01:16:27,365 --> 01:16:28,801
- I mean, you're gonna be.

1034
01:16:30,107 --> 01:16:31,499
- Huge?
- Yeah, yeah.

1035
01:16:32,370 --> 01:16:34,067
- Can't miss first contact.

1036
01:16:34,111 --> 01:16:37,027
- Well, it's on a dartboard.

1037
01:16:38,855 --> 01:16:40,204
So, you know, if
you can't make it,

1038
01:16:40,247 --> 01:16:41,422
I completely understand.

1039
01:16:41,466 --> 01:16:42,946
- You can keep me posted.

1040
01:16:43,729 --> 01:16:44,556
- Okay.

1041
01:16:49,735 --> 01:16:54,305
You know, I'm gonna miss you
when you're gone, Maggie.

1042
01:17:03,923 --> 01:17:08,928
- So that E, the,
what is it, the EBA?

The name of that sequencing.

1044

It was really fun.

tried to take it from me.

- Yeah.
