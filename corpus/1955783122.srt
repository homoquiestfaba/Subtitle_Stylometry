00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:28,471
YEAH, SURE.

174
00:07:28,507 --> 00:07:30,965
YOU KNOW, MOM,
ONCE THE NEW SAVE NOW OPENS,

175
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,635
YOU'LL HAVE OVER 50 KINDS OF TEA
TO CHOOSE FROM.

176
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:36,879
WHAT ON EARTH WOULD I NEED
50 KINDS OF TEA FOR?

177
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:39,540
I DON'T KNOW. OPTIONS, MAYBE.

178
00:07:39,575 --> 00:07:41,525
(water running)
NO.

179
00:07:41,561 --> 00:07:43,077
IF WE DON'T BUY OUR TEA
FROM THE CHANG FAMILY,

180
00:07:43,112 --> 00:07:44,229
HOW WILL I KNOW IF THEIR SON
PASSED THE BAR

181
00:07:44,264 --> 00:07:49,567
OR THAT LYNN'S MOTHER PERFECTED
HER ALMOND COOKIE RECIPE?

182
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:51,878
(under breath)
IT'S CALLED TWITTER.

183
00:07:51,913 --> 00:07:54,289
(indistinct conversations)
GREAT. THANKS.

184
00:07:54,324 --> 00:07:55,640
SO THAT'S WHY YOU'RE HERE?

185
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:57,475
THE CITY COUNCIL MEETING
LATER?

186
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:59,368
IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS,
YES.

187
00:07:59,404 --> 00:08:02,063
ARE YOU HERE ALONE,

188
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:03,290
OR DID YOU BRING SOME
OF THOSE LAWYERS WITH YOU?

189
00:08:03,325 --> 00:08:05,708
BECAUSE I CAN SET EXTRA PLACES
AT THANKSGIVING IF YOU WANT.

190
00:08:05,744 --> 00:08:08,069
THAT'S FUNNY, MOM.

191
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:11,038
WELL, I'LL TAKE MY DAUGHTER
ANY WAY I CAN GET HER.

192
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:12,540
YOU ARE STAYING FOR
THANKSGIVING, THOUGH, RIGHT?

193
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:16,252
(clanging)

194
00:08:16,288 --> 00:08:18,071
COULD THAT THING BE
ANY MORE...
(door closes)

195
00:08:20,933 --> 00:08:22,158
CARTER.

196
00:08:22,193 --> 00:08:24,118
HEY.

197
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,690
(sighs)

198
00:08:29,725 --> 00:08:31,167
YOU LOOK...
(claps hands)

199
00:08:34,748 --> 00:08:37,173
YOU, TOO. YEAH.

200
00:08:42,038 --> 00:08:44,172
(exhales)
HOW'S CHICAGO?

201
00:08:44,207 --> 00:08:47,133
CRAZY.

202
00:08:47,168 --> 00:08:49,060
BUSY. CRAZY BUSY.

203
00:08:57,012 --> 00:08:59,946
I FORGOT SOMETHING BACK
AT THE JOB SITE. I...

204
00:08:59,981 --> 00:09:01,864
OKAY.

205
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,182
GOOD TO SEE YOU, THOUGH.

206
00:09:03,218 --> 00:09:04,033
YOU, TOO.

207
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,590
(clanging)

208
00:09:10,626 --> 00:09:14,752
YOU KNOW, THINGS DIDN'T WORK OUT
WITH HIM AND... TRISHA.
(door closes)

209
00:09:14,788 --> 00:09:17,071
OH. WOW. THAT'S A SHAME.

210
00:09:17,106 --> 00:09:19,165
AND HE TURNED ALL
HIS WOODWORKING

211
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,242
INTO A CUSTOM CABINETRY
BUSINESS.

212
00:09:21,277 --> 00:09:23,803
IT'S BACK-ORDERED
FOR OVER A YEAR.

213
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:25,138
YAY FOR CARTER.
(clears throat)

214
00:09:28,885 --> 00:09:30,643
(door closes)
HEY, WE'RE HERE!

215
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:34,330
OH, MY GOSH.
LOOK HOW OLD YOU GOT.

216
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:35,348
AND SO DID YOU, JAKE.

217
00:09:35,384 --> 00:09:37,984
OH, THAT'S SO NICE OF YOU,
MOUTH BREATHER.
MM-HMM.

218
00:09:38,019 --> 00:09:41,270
OH! WELL, JUST THINK,
NOW THAT YOU'RE FINALLY HERE,

219
00:09:41,306 --> 00:09:43,656
MOM CAN SHUT UP
ABOUT HOW YOU NEVER VISIT.

220
00:09:43,692 --> 00:09:45,233
OH, YEAH.
THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.

221
00:09:45,268 --> 00:09:46,626
MAYBE I'LL JUST ABANDON
EVERYTHING

222
00:09:46,661 --> 00:09:48,344
I'VE WORKED SO HARD FOR

223
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:49,929
AND MOVE RIGHT ON BACK
TO GOOD OLD STREETSVILLE.

224
00:09:49,965 --> 00:09:51,339
HOORAY! THEN BY THIS TIME
NEXT YEAR,

225
00:09:51,374 --> 00:09:55,568
YOU CAN BE A SINGLE,
DIVORCED MOTHER JUST LIKE ME.

226
00:09:55,603 --> 00:09:57,195
MM, EXCELLENT.
IT'S SETTLED.

227
00:09:57,230 --> 00:10:01,832
I HAVE AN IDEA I WANNA GET
TO MY BUSINESS-SAVVY DAUGHTERS.

228
00:10:01,868 --> 00:10:03,884
OH.
THIS IS FOR ME
AND MY CONTEMPORARIES

229
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,044
WHO ARE GOING
THROUGH THE CHANGE.

230
00:10:05,079 --> 00:10:08,590
OKAY. INSTEAD OF HOT YOGA,

231
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:11,734
YOU HAVE THE A.C. CRANKED UP
TO 50,

232
00:10:11,769 --> 00:10:14,161
AND YOU HAVE FANS BLOWING
LIKE A STORM.

233
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:19,041
I'M CALLING IT "FROZEN YOGA."

234
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:22,061
'CAUSE THOSE ZUMBA PEOPLE
HAVE MADE A FORTUNE,

235
00:10:22,097 --> 00:10:23,972
AND I THINK IT'S A LOCK.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

236
00:10:24,007 --> 00:10:26,106
IT'S GOOD, ISN'T IT?
ISN'T IT GOOD?
YES. MM.

237
00:10:26,142 --> 00:10:28,717
YES, MEL, PLEASE DO TELL US
WHAT YOU THINK.

238
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:32,647
UH... ACTUALLY,
IT'S... INTERESTING.

239
00:10:32,682 --> 00:10:33,898
THERE'S DEFINITELY
A MARKET FOR IT.

240
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:35,541
I'M JUST A LITTLE CURIOUS,
THOUGH.

241
00:10:35,577 --> 00:10:36,626
HOW DO YOU...
BURN ANY CALORIES?

242
00:10:36,661 --> 00:10:39,261
THE WHOLE POINT OF BIKRAM
IS TO SPEED UP THE PROCESS,

243
00:10:39,297 --> 00:10:40,347
TO EXPEDITE.

244
00:10:40,382 --> 00:10:44,475
EXCUSE ME. THE WHOLE POINT
OF YOGA IS TO SLOW DOWN

245
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:45,535
AND STRETCH AND BREATHE.

246
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:49,047
YEAH, IF YOU HAVE TIME TO
SLOW DOWN, STRETCH, AND BREATHE.

247
00:10:49,082 --> 00:10:50,690
GIVE ME THAT THING.
MOM.

248
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:51,799
IS THERE AN APP FOR STOPPING
TO SMELL THE ROSES?

249
00:10:51,834 --> 00:10:53,201
THAT'S WHAT I WANNA KNOW.

250
00:10:53,236 --> 00:10:57,846
MM, YES. AND MOM TELLS ME THAT
YOU'RE STAYING FOR THANKSGIVING.

251
00:10:57,882 --> 00:11:00,642
I THOUGHT THAT YOU WERE
GOING TO THE BAHAMAS

252
00:11:00,677 --> 00:11:02,493
WITH YOUR FRIEN--
(thud)

253
00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:06,130
THE BAHAMAS?

254
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:07,999
I-I ASSUMED THAT YOU WERE
STAYING HERE WITH US.

255
00:11:08,034 --> 00:11:13,095
(sighs) I DIDN'T REALIZE
THE DATES WHEN I BOOKED IT,

256
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:15,664
AND NOW, UH, YOU KNOW,
THE TICKETS ARE PAID FOR.

257
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:18,134
SO...
WELL, I GET IT.

258
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:21,187
I MEAN, THAT--THAT'LL BE FUN
WITH YOUR GIRLFRIENDS.

259
00:11:21,223 --> 00:11:23,189
I JUST WISH
IT WASN'T THANKSGIVING.

260
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:27,192
BUT, YOU KNOW, WE'RE GONNA JUST
BE DOING THE SAME OLD STUFF

261
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:31,747
WE DO EVERY YEAR ANYWAY, SO...

262
00:11:31,782 --> 00:11:34,625
IT'LL BE FUN.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

263
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:37,403
I KNEW
SHE WAS GONNA CRY.

264
00:11:37,439 --> 00:11:40,240
YOU SHOULD HAVE JUST TOLD HER
YOU WERE GOING WITH A BOYFRIEND.

265
00:11:40,242 --> 00:11:42,308
SHE WOULD'VE... DRIVEN YOU
TO THE AIRPORT HERSELF.

266
00:11:42,344 --> 00:11:48,088
MM. UNLESS, OF COURSE, YOU DON'T
WANT  <i> CARTER  </i> TO KNOW.

267
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:50,699
I DID HEAR
THAT HE STOPPED BY.

268
00:11:50,735 --> 00:11:52,126
OH, REALLY?
MM-HMM.

269
00:11:52,161 --> 00:11:53,794
GOOD OLD CARTER.
STILL SINGLE.

270
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:55,705
(thud)
OW.

271
00:11:57,859 --> 00:12:00,502
(indistinct conversations)

272
00:12:00,537 --> 00:12:01,669
(gavel bangs)

273
00:12:01,704 --> 00:12:05,807
(woman) AT THIS TIME,
WE'D LIKE TO MOTION FOR A VOTE.

274
00:12:05,842 --> 00:12:07,058
SAVE NOW HAS MADE
A NEW GENEROUS OFFER

275
00:12:07,093 --> 00:12:08,776
FOR THE PROPOSED SITE,

276
00:12:08,812 --> 00:12:10,286
AND I THINK WE ALL AGREE THAT--

277
00:12:10,321 --> 00:12:12,421
MAYOR GORDON,
WE HAVEN'T AGREED ON

278
00:12:12,457 --> 00:12:14,990
ANYTHING EXCEPT THAT
MOST OF US DON'T WANT

279
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:16,884
THAT STORE
IN OUR BACKYARD.

280
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:19,654
(crowd cheers and murmurs)

281
00:12:19,689 --> 00:12:21,956
(applause)
LET'S LET MEL SPEAK.

282
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:24,726
(conversations fade)

283
00:12:24,761 --> 00:12:26,444
(sighs) IT'S EASY TO FORGET

284
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:29,605
THAT THIS IS NOT JUST
AN ECONOMIC ISSUE.

285
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,024
IT'S EMOTIONAL.

286
00:12:31,059 --> 00:12:33,092
IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT JOBS.

287
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:35,419
IT'S ABOUT IDENTITY.

288
00:12:35,454 --> 00:12:37,430
THIS IS MY HOME, TOO.

289
00:12:37,466 --> 00:12:39,765
I LOVE STREETSVILLE,
JUST LIKE THE REST OF YOU.

290
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:41,217
IT'S THE VERY DEFINITION
OF HOMEGROWN--

291
00:12:41,252 --> 00:12:43,336
THE SHOPS, THE FOOD...

292
00:12:43,371 --> 00:12:45,145
THE WAY OF LIFE.

293
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:47,323
IT'S REALLY SOMETHING
TO BE PROUD OF.

294
00:12:47,358 --> 00:12:49,075
BUT BUILDING
A SAVE NOW MEGA STORE

295
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:50,368
IS NOT GOING TO CHANGE THAT.

296
00:12:50,403 --> 00:12:55,481
OUR PHILOSOPHY IS TO EMBRACE
THE IDENTITY OF OUR COMMUNITIES.

297
00:12:55,516 --> 00:12:57,525
THEN WHY DID BOTH
NEIGHBORING COUNTIES

298
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,126
REJECT YOUR PROPOSAL?

299
00:12:59,161 --> 00:13:01,187
(crowd clamors)
I'LL TELL YOU WHY.

300
00:13:01,222 --> 00:13:03,364
BECAUSE A NEW SAVE NOW
IS GONNA BRING IN

301
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:05,874
<i>THOUSANDS  </i> OF PEOPLE
FROM SURROUNDING TOWNS.

302
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,510
(crowd clamors)
NEXT THING YOU KNOW,

303
00:13:07,545 --> 00:13:09,979
THE STATE IS GONNA APPROVE
A HIGHWAY COMING THROUGH HERE,

304
00:13:10,014 --> 00:13:12,590
AND THEN
OUR TIGHT-KNIT COMMUNITY

305
00:13:12,626 --> 00:13:14,325
IS GONNA BECOME JUST
ANOTHER ANONYMOUS SUBURB.

306
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,110
THESE BULK STORES--
THEY SELL EVERYTHING.

307
00:13:16,145 --> 00:13:18,004
THEY'RE GONNA UNDERCUT
LOCAL PRICES,

308
00:13:18,039 --> 00:13:19,130
AND THEN YOU KNOW
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN.

309
00:13:19,165 --> 00:13:23,393
ONE BY ONE, ALL OF OUR
MOM AND POP SHOPS THAT WE LOVE--

310
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:25,094
THEY WILL GO UNDER.

311
00:13:25,129 --> 00:13:28,589
EVERYONE SHOULD BE GIVEN
A CHOICE IN THEIR FUTURE.

312
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:30,499
DON'T YOU AGREE, CARTER?

313
00:13:30,535 --> 00:13:33,002
WELL, I DON'T KNOW, MELODY,
NOT IF THAT CHOICE

314
00:13:33,037 --> 00:13:35,237
ISN'T MUTUAL AMONG
BOTH PARTIES.

315
00:13:35,273 --> 00:13:37,848
I THINK WHAT IT BOILS DOWN TO
IS WHETHER A TOWN

316
00:13:37,884 --> 00:13:39,709
WANTS TO REMAIN MIRED
IN ANONYMITY

317
00:13:39,744 --> 00:13:41,736
OR BE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY
TO GROW.

318
00:13:41,771 --> 00:13:43,488
AND I THINK GROWTH
IS STRONGEST

319
00:13:43,523 --> 00:13:46,440
WHERE ONE'S ROOTS
ARE DEEPEST.

320
00:13:46,476 --> 00:13:48,393
NOT UNLESS
THEY'VE BEEN NURTURED.

321
00:13:48,428 --> 00:13:51,237
MAYBE THEY DIDN'T WANNA BE.

322
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:59,219
CAN WE GET BACK TO THE BUSINESS
AT HAND? I MOTION FOR A VOTE.

323
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:01,230
(man) NO!
(crowd groaning)

324
00:14:01,266 --> 00:14:04,233
(man) COME ON!
WE DON'T NEED A VOTE.
(woman) WE'RE NOT READY TO VOTE!

325
00:14:04,268 --> 00:14:05,843
I THINK WE SHOULD
PUT THIS OFF...

326
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:09,321
(crowd speaking at once)

327
00:14:09,356 --> 00:14:11,457
A MOTION HAS JUST BEEN MADE

328
00:14:11,493 --> 00:14:14,334
TO DELAY THE VOTE
UNTIL AFTER THE WEEKEND

329
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:15,795
SO THAT EVERYONE CAN HAVE
A CHANCE TO READ

330
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:17,797
SAVE NOW'S LATEST PROPOSAL.

331
00:14:17,832 --> 00:14:19,974
I SECOND THE MOTION. DONE.

332
00:14:20,009 --> 00:14:21,592
(gavel bangs)

333
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:24,478
(indistinct conversations)

334
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:34,755
MMM. COFFEE SMELLS GOOD.

335
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,198
HEY, MOM.

336
00:14:36,233 --> 00:14:39,159
HEY, HONEY. I'M DOING SOME YOGA.
YOU WANNA DO IT WITH ME?

337
00:14:39,195 --> 00:14:41,888
UH--
(doorbell rings)

338
00:14:41,923 --> 00:14:43,564
(door opens)

339
00:14:43,599 --> 00:14:44,840
(Mel) HELLO.
(Carter) HEY.

340
00:14:44,876 --> 00:14:46,651
(door closes)

341
00:14:46,686 --> 00:14:48,769
WOW. ELAINE, LOOK AT YOU.
NICE JOB.

342
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:51,055
MUST HAVE BEEN NICE TO SPEND
THE WEEKEND WITH YOUR DAUGHTER.

343
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:55,551
OH, IT WAS WONDERFUL...
WHEN SHE WASN'T ON THE PHONE.

344
00:14:55,586 --> 00:14:57,645
YOU GOT A SEC?

345
00:14:57,647 --> 00:14:59,564
UH, ACTUALLY, NO.
I'M GETTING ON A CONFERENCE CALL

346
00:14:59,599 --> 00:15:01,390
IN 34 MINUTES
WITH GERMANY.

347
00:15:01,426 --> 00:15:03,450
PERFECT.
I'LL HAVE YOU BACK IN 33.

348
00:15:03,486 --> 00:15:05,428
WAIT. WAIT.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
BYE!

349
00:15:05,463 --> 00:15:06,704
PUT ME DOWN!
BYE!

350
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,764
AAH! UHH!

351
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:09,574
COME ON. YOU COULDN'T AT LEAST
GET MY COAT?

352
00:15:09,609 --> 00:15:12,944
IT'S COLD OUT HERE. THIS IS
AN... (muffled) ABDUCTION.

353
00:15:15,507 --> 00:15:18,165
WHERE ARE WE GOING?

354
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,401
YOU'LL SEE SOON ENOUGH.

355
00:15:20,436 --> 00:15:22,495
(sighs)

356
00:15:24,507 --> 00:15:26,348
SO, UH...

357
00:15:26,384 --> 00:15:30,085
WHAT HAPPENED WITH YOU
AND OL' TRISHA?

358
00:15:30,121 --> 00:15:33,147
CAUGHT HER IN BED
WITH SOMEONE.

359
00:15:33,183 --> 00:15:36,976
WOW. THAT'S ROUGH.
DID YOU KNOW HIM?

360
00:15:37,012 --> 00:15:38,486
YES, I DID...

361
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:40,263
KNOW  <i> HER.</i>

362
00:15:40,298 --> 00:15:42,031
(stifles laugh)

363
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:45,734
MM. SORRY. THAT'S...

364
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:46,894
MM.

365
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:55,419
(brakes squeal)

366
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:57,405
(gears shift, engine turns off)

367
00:15:59,642 --> 00:16:01,167
OKAY, HERE WE ARE AT THE CORNER
OF MEMORY LANE

368
00:16:01,202 --> 00:16:03,277
AND WHAT IS THE POINT?

369
00:16:03,312 --> 00:16:07,081
THE POINT IS I BOUGHT IT...
AGAIN.

370
00:16:07,116 --> 00:16:08,541
(door squeaks)

371
00:16:12,421 --> 00:16:14,555
YOU LIVE HERE?
I'M CONFUSED.

372
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:16,707
I THOUGHT WE SOLD IT
WHEN I...

373
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:18,459
TOOK THAT JOB
AND LEFT ME?

374
00:16:18,494 --> 00:16:20,394
YEAH.

375
00:16:20,429 --> 00:16:22,063
NEW OWNERS SAT ON IT.
I KEPT TABS ON IT,

376
00:16:22,098 --> 00:16:23,931
WHICH AGGRAVATED
THE HELL OUT OF TRISHA,

377
00:16:23,967 --> 00:16:26,067
BUT IT AGGRAVATED HER
EVEN MORE

378
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:29,545
WHEN I SOLD MY PLACE
TO BUY IT BACK AFTER WE SPLIT.

379
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:31,839
SOUNDS LIKE
A HEALTHY RELATIONSHIP.

380
00:16:31,874 --> 00:16:33,257
SPENT THE LAST YEAR OR SO
GUTTING IT

381
00:16:33,293 --> 00:16:34,842
AND DOING ALL THIS,

382
00:16:34,877 --> 00:16:35,859
AND PENDING THE APPROVAL
OF PERMITS,

383
00:16:35,895 --> 00:16:37,528
WE OPEN EARLY NEXT YEAR.

384
00:16:37,563 --> 00:16:39,397
WATCH YOUR HEAD 'CAUSE I'M
HANGING SOME STUFF

385
00:16:39,432 --> 00:16:41,165
FROM THE CEILING,

386
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,101
AND THE RUNNER
IS NOT FIXED YET, MELODY.

387
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:46,929
(squeals)
(step creaks)

388
00:16:46,965 --> 00:16:51,617
OKAY, PLEASE DON'T CALL ME
"MELODY."

389
00:16:51,652 --> 00:16:56,080
(sighs) WOW. OKAY.
I'M IMPRESSED.

390
00:16:56,115 --> 00:16:59,232
YOU DID ALL THIS YOURSELF?

391
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:00,634
WHAT? STRIP AWAY
ALL THE OLD,

392
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:01,752
REBUILD THE FOUNDATION
ON MY OWN,

393
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:03,996
REFINISH EVERYTHING MYSELF?

394
00:17:04,031 --> 00:17:06,232
YOU'RE NOT SPEAKING
METAPHORICALLY, ARE YOU?

395
00:17:06,267 --> 00:17:10,644
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA CALL IT,
THE BITTER B&B? (chuckles)

396
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,496
I SEE YOU IN THERE, MEL.

397
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:15,508
I-I SEE YOU UNDER ALL THIS,
UNDER--UNDER THE...

398
00:17:15,543 --> 00:17:16,542
TAILORED SUIT AND ALL THAT
MAKEUP YOU PUT ON...

399
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:18,694
(whispers) JUST TO MAKE YOU LOOK
LIKE YOU'RE NOT WEARING ANY.

400
00:17:18,729 --> 00:17:21,497
F.Y.I.--I'M HAPPY. THIS IS
WHAT HAPPY LOOKS LIKE. SEE?

401
00:17:21,532 --> 00:17:24,575
SERIOUSLY? HALF-STARVED?
PHYSICALLY AND EMOTIONALLY?

402
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:27,135
(huffs) WAIT.

403
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:28,129
DO YOU THINK
I LOOK SKINNY?

404
00:17:28,164 --> 00:17:32,666
HA! I THINK YOU ARE RUNNING
FROM WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW

405
00:17:32,702 --> 00:17:34,418
TO WHAT YOU'LL NEVER KNOW

406
00:17:34,453 --> 00:17:35,786
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T ACTUALLY
END UP AT A PLACE

407
00:17:35,822 --> 00:17:38,372
THAT DOESN'T EVEN EXIST.
AT LEAST I'M TRYING.

408
00:17:38,408 --> 00:17:39,407
ON THE WAY HERE,
I PASSED BY THE CEMETERY.

409
00:17:39,442 --> 00:17:42,384
THAT IS FARTHER THAN MOST
LOCALS GET FROM STREETSVILLE.

410
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:43,928
HAS IT EVER
EVEN OCCURRED TO YOU

411
00:17:43,963 --> 00:17:45,779
THAT STREETSVILLE
ISN'T WHERE THEY ENDED UP

412
00:17:45,815 --> 00:17:48,131
BUT WHERE
THEY ACTUALLY WANTED TO BE?

413
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:50,134
(cell phone vibrates)
I HAVE TO TAKE THIS.

414
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:51,694
WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT,

415
00:17:51,729 --> 00:17:53,170
YOU ARE STILL YOU,
AND I AM ME,

416
00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:54,955
AND WE ARE RIGHT HERE
IN THIS PLACE

417
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:56,114
THAT WE USED TO BE US.
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?

418
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:59,885
WHAT? IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO.
IT WAS LIKE A HUNDRED YEARS AGO.

419
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,720
WE WERE YOUNG. I DON'T KNOW.
IT WAS BAD TIMING.

420
00:18:01,755 --> 00:18:04,239
CONGRATULATIONS
ON A JOB WELL DONE,

421
00:18:04,275 --> 00:18:04,990
BUT I'M GONNA LEAVE NOW.

422
00:18:07,444 --> 00:18:09,854
AFTER EVERYTHING I'VE DONE HERE,
YOUR LAWYERS ARE, UH,

423
00:18:09,889 --> 00:18:13,382
THEY'RE PRESSURING ME TO--
WELL, NO, THREATENING ME TO SELL

424
00:18:13,417 --> 00:18:13,958
JUST SO THEY CAN
TEAR IT DOWN.

425
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:20,832
I... I REALLY HAD
NO IDEA.

426
00:18:20,867 --> 00:18:22,308
OUR BED & BREAKFAST
IS RIGHT WHERE

427
00:18:22,343 --> 00:18:23,793
THE PARKING LOT
IS GOING TO BE.

428
00:18:23,828 --> 00:18:27,605
OKAY. IT'S NOT OURS.
IT'S YOURS.

429
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:32,151
AND I'M SURE YOU WERE OFFERED
FAIR MARKET VALUE.

430
00:18:32,186 --> 00:18:33,577
AND I'M NOT SURE
YOU EVEN KNOW

431
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:34,653
THE MEANING
OF THE WORD "VALUE," MEL.

432
00:18:34,688 --> 00:18:36,288
MAYBE YOU SHOULD
LOOK THAT UP.

433
00:18:36,324 --> 00:18:40,268
THANKS FOR THE TOUR.
I'LL WALK BACK.

434
00:18:40,303 --> 00:18:41,860
I WON'T LET IT HAPPEN.
OH, REALLY?

435
00:18:41,896 --> 00:18:42,820
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO
ABOUT IT?

436
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:45,164
MELODY, DON'T--DON'T--
OKAY, DON'T CALL ME "MELODY."

437
00:18:45,199 --> 00:18:46,332
FINE.
JUST PLEASE, REMEMBER--

438
00:18:46,367 --> 00:18:47,866
I REMEMBER EVERYTHING!

439
00:18:47,902 --> 00:18:52,654
THE RUNNER'S LOOSE!
(screaming)

440
00:18:52,689 --> 00:18:53,873
MEL?!

441
00:19:04,402 --> 00:19:07,052
(groaning softly)

442
00:19:12,969 --> 00:19:14,810
OH, MELODY.
(exhales)

443
00:19:14,845 --> 00:19:16,803
OH. SWEETHEART.

444
00:19:16,839 --> 00:19:18,914
OH, THANK GOD. YOU HAD US
SCARED TO DEATH.

445
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:21,275
HEY. (whispers) HI.

446
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:23,928
HOW YOU FEELING?

447
00:19:23,963 --> 00:19:26,280
WHOA. WHAT--WHAT--
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

448
00:19:26,315 --> 00:19:27,489
WHAT, A MAN CAN'T KISS
HIS OWN WIFE, MEL?

449
00:19:27,525 --> 00:19:31,277
WIFE? WE'RE NOT MARRIED.

450
00:19:31,312 --> 00:19:33,462
WHERE DO YOU LIVE, MELODY?

451
00:19:33,497 --> 00:19:37,190
MEL. 6001 LAKE STREET.
CHICAGO.

452
00:19:37,226 --> 00:19:39,093
CHICAGO?

453
00:19:39,128 --> 00:19:42,563
AND WHERE DO YOU WORK?

454
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:44,515
I'M THE VICE PRESIDENT
OF OPERATIONS AT SAVE NOW.

455
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:46,175
YOUR FULL NAME?
MEL.

456
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:48,043
MELODY GERARD.

457
00:19:48,078 --> 00:19:51,297
UH...

458
00:19:51,332 --> 00:19:53,224
MELODY  <i> McCLURE.</i>

459
00:19:53,259 --> 00:19:59,772
AND WE LIVE ON  <i> ELM STREET,</i>
RIGHT HERE IN STREETSVILLE.

460
00:19:59,807 --> 00:20:03,108
WHAT?

461
00:20:11,978 --> 00:20:14,011
OKAY, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU GUYS ARE DOING,

462
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:17,973
BUT I AM NOT BUYING IT.
SWEETIE, YOU GOT HIT
ON THE HEAD,

463
00:20:18,009 --> 00:20:19,191
OBVIOUSLY A LITTLE BIT HARDER
THAN WE THOUGHT,

464
00:20:19,226 --> 00:20:20,943
SO YOU NEED TO TAKE IT EASY.

465
00:20:20,978 --> 00:20:22,653
YOU REALLY DON'T KNOW
WHO THESE PEOPLE ARE?

466
00:20:22,688 --> 00:20:25,072
NO, I KNOW WHO THEY ARE.
I'M JUST NOT MARRIED,

467
00:20:25,107 --> 00:20:26,815
AND I DON'T LIVE
IN STREETSVILLE, FOR GOD SAKE.

468
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:29,101
MRS. McCLURE, YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY
SUFFERING SOME KIND OF DELUSION

469
00:20:29,136 --> 00:20:32,646
BROUGHT ON BY THE HEAD TRAUMA.
YOU NEED TO LIE DOWN

470
00:20:32,681 --> 00:20:33,947
AND LET ME EXAMINE YOU
FURTHER.

471
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:36,825
WHAT I NEED TO DO
IS GET OUT OF HERE.

472
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:38,352
THAT'S WHAT I NEED TO DO.
I MEAN, I KNOW YOU GUYS

473
00:20:38,387 --> 00:20:39,603
DON'T WANT THE STORE,
BUT THIS IS SICK.

474
00:20:39,638 --> 00:20:42,398
MELODY, YOU--YOU DON'T REALLY
THINK YOU'RE NOT MARRIED

475
00:20:42,433 --> 00:20:45,284
AND YOU LIVE IN CHICAGO
AND YOU WORK FOR SAVE NOW?
WHAT I THINK IS THAT

476
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,612
YOU ALL HAVE TOO MUCH TIME
ON YOUR HANDS, OKAY?
MELODY, BACK IN BED.

477
00:20:47,647 --> 00:20:53,317
(doctor) MRS. McCLURE--
I HAVE TO PEE.
DOES MARRIED MELODY STILL PEE?

478
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:54,860
(whispers) WHAT?

479
00:20:54,895 --> 00:20:56,929
(sighs)

480
00:20:56,965 --> 00:20:58,072
(exhales deeply) OKAY, OKAY.
(turns on faucet)

481
00:20:58,107 --> 00:20:59,332
(water running)

482
00:20:59,367 --> 00:21:01,533
(slaps palms)

483
00:21:01,569 --> 00:21:04,270
BAD DREAM, BAD DREAM.
(breathes heavily) OW.

484
00:21:04,305 --> 00:21:05,621
NO. IT'S REAL. OKAY.

485
00:21:05,656 --> 00:21:09,316
IT'S A JOKE. IT'S A JOKE.

486
00:21:09,352 --> 00:21:10,910
OH, THEY'RE CRAZY.
THEY'RE ALL CRAZY.

487
00:21:10,945 --> 00:21:13,403
YOU'RE NOT CRAZY.
(whispers) YOU'RE NOT CRAZY.

488
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:14,305
(knock on door)
(woman) MEL?

489
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:16,173
JUST A MINUTE.

490
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:17,524
DOCTOR, WHAT IS GOING ON?

491
00:21:17,559 --> 00:21:19,585
PHYSICALLY, SHE'S FINE.

492
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:21,145
UH, THE X-RAY SHOWS
NO HEMORRHAGING.

493
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:24,932
ONLY A SLIGHT CONTUSION
WITH A RESULTING CONCUSSION.

494
00:21:24,967 --> 00:21:26,150
(sighs)

495
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:46,645
MY GUESS IS THAT
SHE'S SUFFERING

496
00:21:46,681 --> 00:21:48,722
FROM SOMETHING CALLED
LACUNAR AMNESIA.

497
00:21:48,757 --> 00:21:51,075
IT LEAVES A GAP
IN THE RECORDED MEMORY.

498
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:53,118
SHE'S OBVIOUSLY FILLED IT IN
WITH A FANTASY,

499
00:21:53,154 --> 00:21:54,945
A WISH FULFILLMENT.

500
00:21:54,981 --> 00:21:57,757
YOU MEAN... SHE WISHES THAT--
THAT SHE NEVER...

501
00:21:57,792 --> 00:21:59,366
SHE'LL NEED TO SEE
A SPECIALIST,

502
00:21:59,402 --> 00:22:01,343
BUT MY UNDERSTANDING
IS THAT THE GAP

503
00:22:01,378 --> 00:22:02,111
USUALLY CLOSES IN DUE TIME.

504
00:22:02,146 --> 00:22:05,022
SOMETIMES IT ONLY TAKES,
YOU KNOW, ONE SMALL THING

505
00:22:05,057 --> 00:22:08,025
FOR IT ALL TO FALL BACK
INTO PLACE, UH, SO TO SPEAK.

506
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:10,361
MEL? YOU OKAY?

507
00:22:10,396 --> 00:22:12,529
(door creaks)

508

640
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:07,701
BOUGHT THE INN. I GOT

YOU DIDN'T WANNA GO.
I TOOK THE JOB,

642

AND WE GOT MARRIED,

646

648

I DIDN'T LOSE MY HEARING,

684
00:29:58,088 --> 00:29:59,980

THIS IS THE KEY DETAIL

BUT THANKS FOR TRYING. (laughs)

747
00:33:22,751 --> 00:33:24,401
YEAH. WELL, THE DOCTOR DID SAY
"ANY LITTLE THING,"

SO... YOU KNOW.

00:33:26,613 --> 00:33:29,422
REALLY?
IS THAT WHAT HE SAID?

00:33:29,458 --> 00:33:32,592
YEAH.

YOU PRETTY MUCH KNOW
EVERYTHING ABOUT ME, HUH?

758
00:33:44,898 --> 00:33:46,631
YES, I DO.

759
00:33:46,666 --> 00:33:47,816
I KNOW--I KNOW EVERYTHING.

760
00:33:47,851 --> 00:33:50,785
I KNOW THAT YOU LIKE MAYONNAISE
ON YOUR FRENCH FRIES.

761

THE SMELL OF RAIN ON CONCRETE.

762

I KNOW YOU HATE
TECHNO MUSIC. I...

763
00:33:55,534 --> 00:33:57,875
(inhales deeply) I KNOW
THAT YOU LOST YOUR LUNCH

764
00:33:57,911 --> 00:33:59,661
ON THE DOUBLE DRAGON
AT FUN WORLD...

765
00:33:59,696 --> 00:34:02,864
(whispers)
BECAUSE I WAS THERE.

766
00:34:11,583 --> 00:34:12,782
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME
SINCE I FELT LIKE

767
00:34:12,817 --> 00:34:14,000
SOMEBODY KNEW ME.

768
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:22,133
FOR YEARS I WONDER WHAT IT WOULD
BE LIKE IF I HADN'T LEFT.

769
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:27,764
IT WAS EXACTLY LIKE THIS,

770
00:34:27,799 --> 00:34:32,677
ONLY NOW I'M HERE
AND I DON'T KNOW IF...

771
00:34:32,712 --> 00:34:34,020
(sighs)

772
00:34:49,362 --> 00:34:50,161
(switch clicks)

773
00:35:13,228 --> 00:35:16,229
DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT I SAID
TO YOU ON OUR FIRST DATE?

774
00:35:18,424 --> 00:35:20,817
SOMETHING LIKE...

775
00:35:20,852 --> 00:35:25,246
"JUST SO YOU KNOW,
WE ARE NOT HAVING SEX."

776
00:35:25,281 --> 00:35:30,343
EXACTLY. STILL APPLIES.

777
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:31,828
EXCEPT IT WAS MORE...

778
00:35:31,863 --> 00:35:37,208
"LIKE, JUST SO YOU  <i> KNOW,</i>
WE ARE  <i> SO  </i> NOT HAVING SEX."

779
00:35:37,244 --> 00:35:39,127
I HATE YOU.

UGH.

784
00:36:46,855 --> 00:36:49,547
OH!

785
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:51,699
WELL PLAYED, KARMA.

786
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:55,728
MEL? WHAT ARE YOU--
WHAT--WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

787
00:36:55,763 --> 00:36:58,272
UH, NOTHING.
JUST GOING FOR A WALK.

788
00:36:58,307 --> 00:36:59,883
C-COME ON BACK INSIDE, OKAY?

789
00:36:59,918 --> 00:37:01,701
'CAUSE IT'S--IT'S--IT'S, UH...
COLD OUT.

790
00:37:01,736 --> 00:37:04,128
(sighs) I'M SORRY.
I CAN'T DO IT.

791
00:37:04,163 --> 00:37:07,115
I-I TRIED. I TRIED
REALLY HARD LAST NIGHT,

792
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:09,175
BUT THIS ISN'T ME.
THIS--THIS ISN'T MY LIFE.

793
00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:13,254
UH... I AM--I'M VICE PRESIDENT
OF A GLOBAL CORPORATION.

794
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:17,783
I'M GOING TO THE BAHAMAS.
I HAVE A SUITE ON THE BEACH!

795
00:37:17,819 --> 00:37:18,451
YOU WANNA--YOU WANNA
GO TO THE BAHAMAS?!

796
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:20,269
I'LL TAKE YOU, OKAY?

797
00:37:20,304 --> 00:37:21,396
YOU--YOU WANNA MOVE BACK
TO THE CITY? FINE!

798
00:37:21,431 --> 00:37:24,048
I'LL--I'LL MOVE BACK. JUST DON'T
LEAVE ME AGAIN, OKAY?

799
00:37:24,083 --> 00:37:26,692
THE YEAR AFTER YOU LEFT ME,
IT WAS...

800
00:37:26,728 --> 00:37:28,152
IT WAS THE WORST YEAR
OF MY LIFE.

801
00:37:30,389 --> 00:37:31,364
WHAT?

802
00:37:33,267 --> 00:37:34,784
IT WAS?

803
00:37:38,056 --> 00:37:41,349
THAT MAKES ME SO...
INCREDIBLY HAPPY.

804
00:37:41,384 --> 00:37:45,036
THE FOOD... IN THE FRIDGE THAT--
THAT WAS HALF-EATEN BY YOU,

805
00:37:45,072 --> 00:37:48,456
I-I STOPPED EATING IT SO I
WOULDN'T HAVE TO THROW IT OUT.

806
00:37:48,492 --> 00:37:53,844
THAT IS SO SWEET AND...
KINDA GROSS AT THE SAME TIME.

807
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:56,581
I PUT YOUR PILLOW
IN A PLASTIC BAG

808
00:37:56,616 --> 00:37:58,950
SO I DIDN'T LOSE YOUR SMELL.

809
00:37:58,986 --> 00:38:01,051
OKAY, THAT'S A LITTLE
STALKER-Y, BUT GO AHEAD.

810
00:38:01,087 --> 00:38:03,138
I LEFT THE SHOPPING LIST
UP ON THE BLACKBOARD

811
00:38:03,173 --> 00:38:04,914
SO I DIDN'T ERASE
YOUR HANDWRITING.

812
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:07,133
I KEPT BUYING BANANAS
AND TOILET PAPER

813
00:38:07,168 --> 00:38:10,870
AND--AND--AND PAPER TOWEL
OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

814
00:38:10,905 --> 00:38:13,264
OH, THIS IS
SO SADISTICALLY SATISFYING.

815
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:14,691
YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

816
00:38:14,726 --> 00:38:17,694
FOR YEARS, I HAVE WONDERED

817
00:38:17,729 --> 00:38:18,778
IF YOU WERE TORTURED
WHEN I LEFT,

818
00:38:18,813 --> 00:38:20,362
AND NOW I GET TO HEAR
FIRSTHAND!

819
00:38:20,398 --> 00:38:21,398
JUST COME BACK IN THE HOUSE.
PLEASE? COME ON.

820
00:38:21,433 --> 00:38:23,333
IT'S FREEZING. COME ON.
WHY DIDN'T YOU COME
AFTER ME?

821
00:38:23,368 --> 00:38:25,126
WHAT?

822
00:38:26,505 --> 00:38:29,021
YOU TOLD ME.

823
00:38:29,057 --> 00:38:31,941
NO, I WAITED... AND WAITED,
AND YOU NEVER CAME.

824
00:38:31,977 --> 00:38:33,935
AND EVENTUALLY,
THE FEELINGS

825
00:38:33,970 --> 00:38:37,696
OF--OF SUCCESS FILLED UP
THE FEELINGS OF LONELINESS,

826
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:38,982
AND THEN ALL THE MEN--
THEY COVERED UP

827
00:38:39,017 --> 00:38:42,844
MEMORIES OF YOU, AND THEN,
THE--THE--THE--THE HIGHS

828
00:38:42,879 --> 00:38:45,013
OF MY CAREER LEVELED OUT
THE LOWS

829
00:38:45,048 --> 00:38:47,240
OF YOU NEVER COMING BACK
FOR ME.

830
00:38:47,275 --> 00:38:48,432
YOU TOLD ME THAT
IF YOU LOVED SOMETHING,

831
00:38:48,468 --> 00:38:52,061
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO SET IT FREE
AND SEE IF IT COMES BACK!

832
00:38:52,097 --> 00:38:53,154
THAT IS THE STUPIDEST THING
I'VE EVER HEARD.

833
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:54,831
WHAT AM I,
A FREAKIN' BOOMERANG?

834
00:38:54,866 --> 00:38:57,124
HAVE YOU NEVER SEEN
ONE ROMANTIC COMEDY?

835
00:38:57,160 --> 00:39:00,152
YOU ARE THE GUY. YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO CHASE AFTER THE GIRL YOU LOVE

836
00:39:00,188 --> 00:39:01,787
AND STOP HER FROM GETTING
ON THE AIRPLANE.

837
00:39:01,823 --> 00:39:03,681
YOU TOOK MY CAR!
IT'S A METAPHOR!

838
00:39:03,716 --> 00:39:06,867
IT WAS 14 YEARS AGO!

839
00:39:06,903 --> 00:39:08,636
YEAH, I REMEMBER IT
LIKE IT WAS YESTERDAY.

840
00:39:08,671 --> 00:39:10,905
WHERE ARE YOU GOING, MELODY?
HOME. AGAIN!

841
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:13,641
NO, NO! THERE'S NOWHERE
TO GO, MELODY!

842
00:39:13,676 --> 00:39:15,843
HEY, CAN YOU STOP
CALLING ME "MELODY"?

843
00:39:15,879 --> 00:39:18,137
(car door closes,
engine starts)

844
00:39:31,628 --> 00:39:34,195
(birds twittering)

845
00:39:45,358 --> 00:39:47,583
(sighs)

846
00:39:49,496 --> 00:39:54,023

WHY DON'T YOU MASH
SOMETHING?

858
00:40:29,995 --> 00:40:32,003
TOMORROW'S THANKSGIVING,

MEL, WE'VE HAD
THESE DISCUSSIONS.

869
00:40:54,435 --> 00:40:56,953
I MEAN, OF COURSE YOU WONDER
WHAT IT WOULD'VE BEEN LIKE

870

APPARENTLY, I DON'T HAVE ANYBODY
AT SAVE NOW WHO KNOWS

1061
00:49:37,725 --> 00:49:39,183
WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON
IN THIS TOWN.

1062
00:49:39,218 --> 00:49:40,826

I AM SO, SO SORRY.

1065
00:49:45,658 --> 00:49:47,149
OH, THAT'S--THAT'S FINE.
YOU'RE DEAN WILCOX.

1066
00:49:47,185 --> 00:49:48,767
HAVE WE MET?

1067
00:49:48,803 --> 00:49:49,777
WELL,
THAT'S A LOADED QUESTION.

1068
00:49:49,812 --> 00:49:53,480
EXCUSE ME?
YOU'RE DEAN WILCOX.

1069
00:49:53,516 --> 00:49:55,440
I'M SORRY
BUT I DON'T REMEMBER--

1070
00:49:55,476 --> 00:49:57,409
NEITHER DO I.
BUT SOMEHOW I DO.

1071
00:49:57,445 --> 00:49:59,036
EXPLAIN THAT.

1072
00:49:59,071 --> 00:50:00,529
AM I MISSING SOMETHING?

1073
00:50:00,565 --> 00:50:03,156
HEY, MEL.
OH, CARTER.

1074
00:50:03,192 --> 00:50:04,566
CARTER McCLURE?
YEAH.

1075
00:50:04,601 --> 00:50:06,685
OH, DEAN WILCOX.

1076
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:08,971
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE A HARD MAN
TO REACH.

1077
00:50:09,007 --> 00:50:10,739
YOU KNOW, IT'S FUNNY,
BECAUSE I THOUGHT WE WERE

1078
00:50:10,775 --> 00:50:13,776
PERFECTLY CLEAR THAT
THE ANSWER IS STILL NO.

1079
00:50:13,811 --> 00:50:16,353
OH, BUT I HAVE SOME NEWS
FOR YOU--

1080
00:50:16,389 --> 00:50:18,381
NEWS THAT WILL AFFECT
YOUR BUSINESS.

1081
00:50:18,416 --> 00:50:20,841
(paper rustling)

1082
00:50:23,196 --> 00:50:25,921
WHAT IS THAT, MEL?

1083
00:50:25,957 --> 00:50:27,932
THE INN HAS BEEN DENIED
ITS BUSINESS PERMITS.

1084
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:30,050
IMAGINE THAT.

1085
00:50:30,086 --> 00:50:32,052
OH, THEY'RE ALL IN CAHOOTS.
THOSE DIRTY RATS.

1086
00:50:32,088 --> 00:50:34,722
WELL, THEY ARE OFFERING
DOUBLE MARKET VALUE

1087
00:50:34,757 --> 00:50:37,116
IN HOPES THAT WE'LL WALK.

1088
00:50:37,118 --> 00:50:38,775
WELL, SINCE THEY WON'T
LET YOU DO BUSINESS ANYWAY,

1089
00:50:38,811 --> 00:50:41,162
IT MIGHT BE AN OPTION
TO CONSIDER.

1090
00:50:41,164 --> 00:50:43,956
EVEN THOUGH I KNOW IT'S NOT
EXACTLY WHAT YOU WANT.

1091
00:50:43,991 --> 00:50:45,399
WHAT I WANT IS JUST TO KEEP
WHAT'S OURS.

1092
00:50:45,434 --> 00:50:47,392
THAT--THAT'S IT.

1093
00:50:47,427 --> 00:50:48,736
I MEAN, WE DIDN'T BUILD
THIS PLACE UP

1094
00:50:48,771 --> 00:50:49,745
JUST SO THEY COULD
TEAR IT DOWN.

1095
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:51,730
THEY'RE NOT GONNA STOP
UNTIL THEY GET WHAT THEY WANT.

1096
00:50:51,765 --> 00:50:55,551
WE'RE IN THEIR CROSSHAIRS NOW,
AND IT'S NOT JUST THE INN.

1097
00:50:55,586 --> 00:50:57,894
NO BUSINESS IN THIS TOWN

1098
00:50:57,930 --> 00:51:00,255
CAN COMPETE
WITH A STORE LIKE THAT.

1099
00:51:00,291 --> 00:51:02,091
(indistinct conversations)

1100
00:51:05,513 --> 00:51:07,120
(gavel bangs)

1101
00:51:07,156 --> 00:51:08,881
SETTLE DOWN PEOPLE.

1102
00:51:08,916 --> 00:51:11,683
THIS MEETING IS NOW
IN SESSION.

1103
00:51:11,719 --> 00:51:13,636
THIS IS
THE FINAL PUBLIC HEARING

1104
00:51:13,671 --> 00:51:14,828
FOR THE MEASURE TO APPROVE

1105
00:51:14,864 --> 00:51:16,413
CONSTRUCTION OF THE SAVE NOW.

1106
00:51:16,448 --> 00:51:18,532
(whispers) THANK YOU.

1107
00:51:18,567 --> 00:51:20,534
(normal voice) LET ME
INTRODUCE MYSELF.

1108
00:51:20,569 --> 00:51:22,961
MY NAME IS DEAN WILCOX.

1109
00:51:22,997 --> 00:51:25,589
AND I JUST WANT TO START
BY SAYING THAT WE ARE NOT

1110
00:51:25,624 --> 00:51:27,708
THE ENEMY HERE, FOLKS.

1111
00:51:27,743 --> 00:51:31,111
SAVE NOW IS
ON THE SIDE OF THE PEOPLE.

1112
00:51:31,147 --> 00:51:32,329
WELL, I GUESS THAT MEANS
THAT NEITHER OF US

1113
00:51:32,365 --> 00:51:33,355
WANT A MEGA STORE, THEN.

1114
00:51:33,391 --> 00:51:35,824
HEAR, HEAR! MM-HMM.

1115
00:51:35,860 --> 00:51:37,484
NOW, COME ON, ELAINE.
THE DATA CLEARLY SHOWS

1116
00:51:37,519 --> 00:51:38,627
THIS IS GONNA BE GOOD
FOR EVERYONE.

1117
00:51:38,662 --> 00:51:41,646
EVEN MEL'S CAFE.

1118
00:51:41,682 --> 00:51:43,048
DO YOU INTEND TO TEAR DOWN
MY INN TO MAKE ROOM

1119
00:51:43,083 --> 00:51:44,725
FOR YOUR NEW SAVE NOW STORE,
MAYOR GORDON?

1120
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:47,594
THERE IS A LEGAL RIGHT
TO PURSUE CERTAIN PROCEDURES

1121
00:51:47,630 --> 00:51:49,229
IF THE CITY BELIEVES THAT

1122
00:51:49,264 --> 00:51:51,715
IT'S IN THEIR BEST INTEREST
OF THE CITY.

1123
00:51:51,750 --> 00:51:52,766
WHAT ABOUT A MORAL RIGHT?

1124
00:51:52,801 --> 00:51:55,936
YOU. (chuckles)

1125
00:51:55,971 --> 00:51:59,231
YOU'RE THE WAITRESS WHO
SPILLS COFFEE ON HER CUSTOMERS.

1126
00:51:59,266 --> 00:52:01,658
I AM THE WAITRESS
THAT OWNS THE CAFE...

1127
00:52:01,694 --> 00:52:06,763
WHERE I SPILL COFFEE
ON MY CUSTOMERS.
(scattered laughter)

1128
00:52:06,798 --> 00:52:09,674
WELL, WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,
DO YOU--

1129
00:52:09,710 --> 00:52:11,877
DID YOU SHOW THEM
THE SIPHON REPORT?

1130
00:52:11,912 --> 00:52:14,971
OH, NO. THAT'S IN-HOUSE
ONLY, ISN'T IT?

1131
00:52:15,007 --> 00:52:18,642
THAT REPORT DETAILS
THE EXPANDED MARKET SHARES

1132
00:52:18,677 --> 00:52:20,970
OF LOCAL BUSINESSES.

1133
00:52:20,972 --> 00:52:22,905
IT ALSO SHOWS THAT THERE IS
AN AVERAGE EXPECTANCY

1134
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:26,750
OF 5 YEARS BEFORE 92%
DOMINANT PROFIT MARGINS

1135
00:52:26,785 --> 00:52:28,978
ARE ACHIEVED
IN EVERY DEPARTMENT.

1136
00:52:29,013 --> 00:52:30,137
(lowered voice)
HOW DOES SHE KNOW THAT?

1137
00:52:30,172 --> 00:52:31,839
I HAVE NO IDEA.

1138
00:52:31,874 --> 00:52:34,090
(clears throat)
WHO IS THIS WOMAN?

1139
00:52:34,126 --> 00:52:36,117
YOU DO HAVE A LEGAL RIGHT.
IT'S ALL LEGAL.

1140
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:39,037
THAT'S HOW YOU
SLEEP AT NIGHT, RIGHT?

1141
00:52:39,073 --> 00:52:40,614
CAN WE BRING THIS
TO A VOTE?

1142
00:52:40,649 --> 00:52:41,991
YES, YES, I MOVE TO--

1143
00:52:42,026 --> 00:52:44,418
ARE YOU REALLY GOING TO USE
THE EXISTING PLOT PLAN?

1144
00:52:44,453 --> 00:52:46,862
EXCUSE ME?

1145
00:52:46,898 --> 00:52:48,713
WHAT ABOUT
THE UTILITY SERVICES?

1146
00:52:48,749 --> 00:52:51,433
SETBACK REQUIREMENTS,
THE EASEMENT?

1147
00:52:51,468 --> 00:52:53,251
(chuckles) YOU WANT A FIGHT?

1148
00:52:53,286 --> 00:52:55,929
IT'LL RUIN THIS TOWN.

1149
00:52:55,965 --> 00:52:57,731
NO, SAVE NOW IS GONNA
RUIN THIS TOWN,

1150
00:52:57,766 --> 00:52:58,457
AND WE'RE NOT GONNA
LET THAT HAPPEN.

1151
00:52:58,492 --> 00:53:00,459
NO!

1152
00:53:00,494 --> 00:53:02,828
(gavel bangs)

1153
00:53:02,863 --> 00:53:05,164
WE HAVE NO INTEREST
IN A FIGHT.

1154
00:53:05,199 --> 00:53:06,782
I'M GONNA FILE
A 4-4-1 INJUNCTION.

1155
00:53:06,817 --> 00:53:08,050
THERE'S GONNA BE SO MUCH
RED TAPE,

1156
00:53:08,085 --> 00:53:09,659
YOU WON'T EVEN BE ABLE
TO OPEN A TOOLBOX.

1157
00:53:09,694 --> 00:53:12,521
WHO ARE YOU?
I WISH I KNEW.

1158
00:53:12,556 --> 00:53:15,633
WELL,
YOU FILE YOUR INJUCTION.

1159
00:53:15,668 --> 00:53:19,244
IT'LL DRAIN EVERY RESOURCE
YOU HAVE.

1160
00:53:19,279 --> 00:53:21,580
(applause)

1161
00:53:21,615 --> 00:53:22,881
YAY, MEL!
WHOO!

1162
00:53:22,917 --> 00:53:25,117
(Elaine) WOO-HOO!

1163
00:53:25,152 --> 00:53:28,829
CAN YOU REALLY FILE
A 4-4-1 INJUNCTION?

1164
00:53:28,864 --> 00:53:31,165
NO, I MADE THAT PART UP.
WHAT?

1165
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:33,158
BUT DID YOU SEE HIS FACE?
HE'S UNNERVED.

1166
00:53:35,963 --> 00:53:38,071
OKAY, RIGHT NOW THEY HAVE
AN 11B ZONING PERMIT.

1167
00:53:38,107 --> 00:53:40,406
HOWEVER, LAST YEAR
A NEW PROVISION WAS MADE

1168
00:53:40,442 --> 00:53:42,909
WHICH REQUIRES
A 6-MONTH ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW.

1169
00:53:42,945 --> 00:53:44,053
NOW THEY HAVE TO FILE THAT
WITH THE STATE,

1170
00:53:44,088 --> 00:53:46,838
BUT SOMETIMES THEY PURPOSEFULLY
FILE THAT AS A P.E.P.

1171
00:53:46,874 --> 00:53:48,606
PROGRESS REPORT
WHICH CAN BYPASS

1172
00:53:48,642 --> 00:53:50,601
CERTAIN LINE ITEM REQUIREMENTS.

1173
00:53:50,603 --> 00:53:51,776
THEY KNOW IT'S JUST GONNA GET
BUMPED RIGHT BACK

1174
00:53:51,812 --> 00:53:52,803
TO ENVIRONMENTAL,
BUT THEIR HOPE IS

1175
00:53:52,838 --> 00:53:54,904
THEY ALREADY HAVE ALL
THE STATE SIGNATURES THEY NEED,

1176
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:56,273
SO IT'S JUST A MATTER OF
PAYING A FINE.

1177
00:53:56,308 --> 00:53:59,926
ALWAYS EASIER TO BEG FORGIVENESS
THAN ASK PERMISSION.

1178
00:53:59,962 --> 00:54:01,912
ANGELA, I WANT YOU TO GO
TO THE DEPARTMENT

1179
00:54:01,948 --> 00:54:03,030
OF BUILDING AND SAFETY.
GET ME THAT 11B PERMIT.

1180
00:54:03,065 --> 00:54:05,732
MOM, GO DOWN TO CITY RECORDS.
SEE IF YOU CAN FIND

1181
00:54:05,768 --> 00:54:08,043
ANY GRANDFATHERED
ZONING LAWS.

1182
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:10,095
MAYBE WE'LL GET LUCKY
AND THE INN WAS BUILT ON

1183
00:54:10,130 --> 00:54:11,922
SACRED BURIAL GROUND
OR SOMETHING.
OKAY.

1184
00:54:11,958 --> 00:54:13,974
CARTER, FIND ALL
THE DOCUMENTATION ON THE INN--

1185
00:54:14,009 --> 00:54:16,268
TAX RECORDS, PURCHASE
AGREEMENT, EVERYTHING.

1186
00:54:16,303 --> 00:54:17,844
YOU SHOULD ALL BE SO LUCKY
TO BUMP YOUR HEAD.

1187
00:54:17,879 --> 00:54:21,456
GO!
OH.

1188
00:54:21,491 --> 00:54:23,400
LOOK, RACHEL,
YOU'RE A CAREER POLITICIAN.

1189
00:54:23,435 --> 00:54:25,594
I HAPPEN TO KNOW
WHAT VOTES COUNT MOST FOR YOU.

1190
00:54:25,596 --> 00:54:29,598
AND FOR SOME REASON,
I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND WHY,

1191
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:33,393
I KNOW IN GREAT DETAIL
HOW SAVE NOW DOES BUSINESS.

1192
00:54:33,428 --> 00:54:35,904
AND WHATEVER PROMISES
THEY'VE MADE YOU,

1193
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:37,773
YOU ARE GONNA END UP
FOOTING THE BILL.

1194
00:54:37,808 --> 00:54:39,983
THEY'VE ASSURED ME
THE TOWN--

1195
00:54:40,018 --> 00:54:42,652
THE TOWN AND SAVE NOW
ARE EQUAL PARTNERS.

1196
00:54:42,687 --> 00:54:44,421
JUST GIVE ME SOME TIME,

1197
00:54:44,456 --> 00:54:45,522
AND I WILL SHOW YOU
THAT THEY'RE NOT.

1198
00:54:49,161 --> 00:54:51,186
WE STILL HAVE 48 HOURS
BEFORE THE COUNCIL VOTES.

1199
00:54:51,221 --> 00:54:53,062
BUT WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

1200
00:54:53,098 --> 00:54:55,198
WE DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES
TO FIGHT 'EM, MEL.

1201
00:55:00,289 --> 00:55:04,291
BUT WE HAVE SOMETHING BETTER.
SOMETHING WE DON'T WANNA LOSE.

1202
00:55:04,326 --> 00:55:06,293
SO WE ARE GONNA FIND
THEIR ACHILLES HEEL

1203
00:55:06,328 --> 00:55:07,870
AND EXPLOIT IT.

1204
00:55:07,905 --> 00:55:09,087
WHEN I WAS AT SAVE NOW...

1205
00:55:12,176 --> 00:55:16,102
COMPANIES LIKE SAVE NOW
PUT PUBLIC IMAGE

1206
00:55:16,137 --> 00:55:17,737
ABOVE EVERYTHING ELSE.

1207
00:55:17,772 --> 00:55:20,949
I THINK WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO
DO THIS THE OLD FASHIONED WAY.

1208
00:55:20,985 --> 00:55:21,658
<i>WHAT INSPIRED YOU</i>
<i>TO TAKE ACTION</i>

1209
00:55:21,693 --> 00:55:23,218
<i>AGAINST SAVE NOW?</i>

1210
00:55:23,253 --> 00:55:24,553
<i>WELL, SO OFTEN,</i>
<i>PEOPLE FEEL LIKE</i>

1211
00:55:24,588 --> 00:55:26,204
<i>THEY DON'T HAVE A VOICE.</i>

1212
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:27,272
<i>LIKE THE SYSTEM</i>
<i>IS BIGGER THAN US.</i>

1213
00:55:27,307 --> 00:55:29,924
<i>WE'RE SIMPLY SAYING,</i>
<i>NOT IN OUR TOWN, NOT ANYMORE.</i>

1214
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:32,135
YAY, MEL!

1215
00:55:32,170 --> 00:55:33,236
<i>LET'S PUT THE PRIORITY</i>
<i>BACK IN THE COMMUNITY,</i>

1216
00:55:33,272 --> 00:55:35,247
<i>AND NOT SO MUCH</i>
<i>ON THE PROFIT.</i>

1217
00:55:35,249 --> 00:55:38,867
<i>DAVID, OR IN THIS CASE,</i>
<i>MEL VERSUS GOLIATH.</i>

1218
00:55:38,902 --> 00:55:42,588
<i>ONLY THIS TIME,</i>
<i>IT'S NOT A SIMPLE STONE</i>

1219
00:55:42,590 --> 00:55:45,040
<i>SHE CARRIES IN HER SLING.</i>
<i>IT'S A WAY OF LIFE.</i>

1220
00:55:45,075 --> 00:55:47,567
<i>BUT WILL IT BE ENOUGH...</i>
WHO THE HELL IS THIS WOMAN?

1221
00:55:47,603 --> 00:55:49,252
SHE KNOWS TOO MUCH.

1222
00:55:49,288 --> 00:55:52,014
THEY MUST'VE HACKED
OUR SYSTEM.

1223
00:55:52,016 --> 00:55:52,848
THIS CAN'T BE HAPPENING.
THIS CAN'T BE HAPPENING.

1224
00:55:52,883 --> 00:55:56,018
NOT ON OUR
100th STORE OPENING.

1225
00:55:56,053 --> 00:55:57,869
WELL, MAYBE THERE'S A WAY
THAT WE COULD TURN THIS

1226
00:55:57,905 --> 00:55:59,263
TO OUR ADVANTAGE.

1227
00:55:59,298 --> 00:56:01,022
HOW?

1228
00:56:01,057 --> 00:56:03,833
BY TURNING IT TO HERS.

1229
00:56:03,869 --> 00:56:05,468
(telephone rings)

1230
00:56:05,504 --> 00:56:07,596
YOU LOOKED SO GOOD.
THAT WAS AMAZING.
GREAT JOB, MEL.

1231
00:56:07,631 --> 00:56:09,406
(ring)

1232
00:56:09,442 --> 00:56:11,100
THIS IS MEL.

1233
00:56:11,135 --> 00:56:12,476
(Carter) SO RELAXED
AND CONFIDENT.

1234
00:56:12,511 --> 00:56:14,627
SHE'S HANGING OUT
ON TV.
SHH!

1235
00:56:14,663 --> 00:56:15,687
IT'S DEAN WILCOX FROM SAVE NOW.

1236
00:56:15,722 --> 00:56:18,407
UH, YES.

1237
00:56:18,442 --> 00:56:20,942
NO, I DON'T--

1238
00:56:20,978 --> 00:56:25,447
OKAY, UM, I WILL SEE YOU
TOMORROW AT 11:00.

1239
00:56:25,482 --> 00:56:27,224
(beep)

1240
00:56:27,259 --> 00:56:29,718
(telephone clatters)

1241
00:56:29,753 --> 00:56:30,794
WELL, HE WANTS TO MEET
WITH ME.

1242
00:56:32,773 --> 00:56:34,089
I THINK WE DID IT.

1243
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:39,644
(laughter)

1244
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:41,221
YES! (exhales loudly)

1245
00:56:46,177 --> 00:56:46,726
(siren wailing in distance,
horn honks)

1246
00:56:50,924 --> 00:56:54,484
I DON'T KNOW WHAT MR. WILCOX
INTENDS HERE,

1247
00:56:54,519 --> 00:56:56,453
BUT I ASSURE YOU
IF YOUR TIME AT SAVE NOW

1248
00:56:56,488 --> 00:56:57,871
EXTENDS BEYOND
THIS MEETING,

1249
00:56:57,906 --> 00:57:00,299
I WILL MAKE IT
A LIVING HELL.

1250
00:57:00,334 --> 00:57:02,133
NO, YOU WON'T, KARL.

1251
00:57:02,169 --> 00:57:03,743
YOU'LL SUCK UP TO MY FACE,
AND THEN TALK ABOUT ME

1252
00:57:03,778 --> 00:57:06,597
WHEN I LEAVE THE ROOM,
BUT THAT'S BUSINESS.

1253
00:57:06,632 --> 00:57:07,456
GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.

1254
00:57:09,409 --> 00:57:13,086
(phone rings)

1255
00:57:13,121 --> 00:57:16,372
MRS. McCLURE.

1256
00:57:16,408 --> 00:57:19,025
SO NICE OF YOU TO COME.
MAY I CALL YOU "MEL"?

1257
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:22,462
SURE, DEAN.

1258
00:57:22,497 --> 00:57:25,115
YOU'RE SAVVY.
A REAL COMMANDO--

1259
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:27,884
GOOD QUALITIES IN BUSINESS,
AND THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ABOUT.

1260
00:57:27,919 --> 00:57:29,336
BUSINESS, RIGHT?

1261
00:57:29,371 --> 00:57:32,231
ACTUALLY, I THINK IN THIS CASE
IT'S A LITTLE MORE PERSONAL.

1262
00:57:32,266 --> 00:57:33,707
I UNDERSTAND.

1263
00:57:33,742 --> 00:57:35,508
PLEASE, HAVE A SEAT.

1264
00:57:35,544 --> 00:57:37,710
I PREFER TO STAND.

1265
00:57:37,746 --> 00:57:39,496
YOU INVITED ME HERE
BECAUSE YOU'RE IN TROUBLE.

1266
00:57:39,531 --> 00:57:43,341
BAD P.R.--IT'S NOT SO GOOD
FOR THE BOTTOM LINE, RIGHT?

1267
00:57:43,377 --> 00:57:46,395
I THINK YOU OVERESTIMATE
YOUR POSITION.

1268
00:57:46,430 --> 00:57:49,597
ALL THIS BAD PRESS--
WE'VE DEAL WITH IT BEFORE.

1269
00:57:49,633 --> 00:57:51,291
IT'LL GO AWAY BEFORE
THAT STORE OPENS.

1270
00:57:51,326 --> 00:57:53,085
IT ALWAYS DOES.

1271
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:54,978
AND GUESS WHAT?

1272
00:57:55,014 --> 00:57:56,830
THE PEOPLE STILL COME
AND BUY FROM US.

1273
00:57:56,865 --> 00:57:59,966
THEN WHAT AM I DOING HERE?

1274
00:58:00,002 --> 00:58:01,801
WE COULD USE
SOMEONE LIKE YOU.

1275
00:58:01,837 --> 00:58:04,621
(chuckles)
YOU'RE JOKING, RIGHT?

1276
00:58:04,656 --> 00:58:09,401
YOU'RE SMART, GOOD IN A ROOM,
MADE MINCEMEAT OUT OF ME.

1277
00:58:09,436 --> 00:58:14,698
AND YOU SEEM TO HAVE
AN INTUITION ABOUT OUR BUSINESS.

1278
00:58:14,733 --> 00:58:17,884
STARTING SALARY--
$150,000.

1279
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:20,604
CONDOMINIUM, CAR.

1280
00:58:20,639 --> 00:58:23,123
LET'S BE HONEST.

1281
00:58:23,158 --> 00:58:24,933
SMALL TOWN LIVING
CAN BE NICE,

1282
00:58:24,968 --> 00:58:27,594
BUT IT CAN GET
A LITTLE STALE AFTER A WHILE.

1283
00:58:27,629 --> 00:58:30,655
WHAT ABOUT THE STORE?

1284
00:58:30,691 --> 00:58:32,624
ONCE YOU SIGN ON HERE,
YOU CAN BE MY PERSON

1285
00:58:32,660 --> 00:58:34,793
ON THE INSIDE
OF THE OTHER SIDE.

1286
00:58:34,828 --> 00:58:38,613
SO YOU WANT ME TO GO BACK
AND TELL THEM THAT WE LOST?

1287
00:58:38,648 --> 00:58:40,898
AND THAT I TOOK A JOB
WITH SAVE NOW?

1288
00:58:40,934 --> 00:58:42,167
I WANT YOU TO GO BACK
AND TELL THEM

1289
00:58:42,202 --> 00:58:43,660
THAT THERE ARE SOME OFFERS

1290
00:58:43,695 --> 00:58:46,513
THAT ARE SIMPLY TOO GOOD
TO REFUSE.

1291
00:58:58,092 --> 00:59:00,084
CARTER?

1292
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:01,570
(Carter)
YEAH, I'M UP HERE!

1293
00:59:04,858 --> 00:59:07,125
SO HOW'D IT GO?

1294
00:59:07,127 --> 00:59:09,619
(sighs) REMEMBER WHEN YOU
TOLD ME YOU WOULD, UH,

1295
00:59:09,655 --> 00:59:10,829
COME TO CHICAGO WITH ME?

1296
00:59:10,864 --> 00:59:12,280
YEAH.

1297
00:59:12,315 --> 00:59:15,675
WELL...

1298
00:59:15,710 --> 00:59:17,369
THEY OFFERED YOU A JOB?

1299
00:59:17,404 --> 00:59:20,413
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

1300
00:59:20,449 --> 00:59:21,831
WHAT, DO THEY THINK
THEY CAN JUST WRITE YOU

1301
00:59:21,867 --> 00:59:23,033
A CHECK AND GET WHATEVER
THE HELL THEY WANT?

1302
00:59:23,068 --> 00:59:28,338
$150,000 CHECK AND A CONDO,
NEW CAR.

1303
00:59:28,373 --> 00:59:30,190
WHAT, YOU ACTUALLY
CONSIDERED THIS?

1304
00:59:30,225 --> 00:59:32,259
OH, I DON'T KNOW.
IT FELT KIND OF GOOD

1305
00:59:32,294 --> 00:59:34,177
TO BE WANTED LIKE THAT,
YOU KNOW?

1306
00:59:34,212 --> 00:59:37,622
CARTER, THAT IS WHO I WAS.

1307
00:59:37,658 --> 00:59:39,874
THAT IS WHO
I THOUGHT I WAS, ANYWAY.

1308
00:59:39,910 --> 00:59:42,344
AND--AND I DON'T KNOW
HOW I KNOW ALL THAT STUFF.

1309
00:59:42,379 --> 00:59:44,437
BUT SOMEHOW
I'M REALLY GOOD AT IT.

1310
00:59:44,473 --> 00:59:46,556
(sighs) I JUST DON'T WANNA
FEEL LIKE I'M--

1311
00:59:46,591 --> 00:59:48,958
STUCK?
I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

1312
00:59:48,993 --> 00:59:51,427
NO, YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO.

1313
00:59:51,463 --> 00:59:53,522
SO WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA TELL EVERYBODY?

1314
00:59:53,557 --> 00:59:55,599
THAT YOU GOT A BETTER OFFER?
I MEAN, IS THAT WHAT

1315
00:59:55,634 --> 00:59:57,158
YOU'RE TELLING ME RIGHT NOW?
AREN'T YOU TIRED OF WORKING
YOURSELF TO THE BONE

1316
00:59:57,194 --> 01:00:00,269
JUST SO YOU CAN GET AHEAD?
HAVE YOU EVER EVEN CONSIDERED

1317
01:00:00,305 --> 01:00:02,847
THAT MAYBE WE ALREADY ARE AHEAD?

1318
01:00:02,882 --> 01:00:06,051
THAT'S WHY
I TURNED THEM DOWN.

1319
01:00:06,086 --> 01:00:10,179
WHAT?

1320
01:00:10,215 --> 01:00:12,007
I TURNED THEM DOWN,
YOU BIG OAF.

1321
01:00:12,042 --> 01:00:13,450
MEL--
I ALREADY SAID NO.

1322
01:00:13,485 --> 01:00:16,770
(Carter) WHOA!
OH!

1323
01:00:16,805 --> 01:00:18,830
WHOA, YOU OKAY?

1324
01:00:18,865 --> 01:00:20,540
YEAH, YOU MIGHT WANNA

1325
01:00:20,576 --> 01:00:23,026
NAIL DOWN THAT RUNNER
BEFORE WE OPEN.

1326
01:00:23,061 --> 01:00:25,370
SO YOU REALLY
TURNED THEM DOWN?
YES.

1327
01:00:25,405 --> 01:00:26,413
WHAT KIND OF SCOUNDREL
DO YOU THINK I AM?

1328
01:00:26,448 --> 01:00:29,408
I THINK YOU'RE A CUTE ONE,
SO I'LL TAKE MY CHANCES.

1329
01:00:29,443 --> 01:00:31,535
(giggles) WHOA.

1330
01:00:31,570 --> 01:00:33,520
WHAT? YOU OKAY?

1331
01:00:33,555 --> 01:00:37,181
YEAH, I-I JUST FELT
THIS WEIRD FEELING

1332
01:00:37,217 --> 01:00:39,592
ALL OF A SUDDEN THAT
I'M FINALLY READY TO ACCEPT

1333
01:00:39,627 --> 01:00:41,244
THAT ALL OF THIS IS...

1334
01:00:41,279 --> 01:00:43,354
REAL?

1335
01:00:43,390 --> 01:00:45,924
YEAH.
EVERYTHING IS SO REAL.

1336
01:00:47,444 --> 01:00:50,554
AAH!
MEL!

1337
01:00:50,589 --> 01:00:52,138
MEL?

1338
01:00:52,173 --> 01:00:53,731
MEL?

1339
01:00:53,767 --> 01:00:55,100
OH, MY GOD.

1340
01:00:55,135 --> 01:00:56,827
MEL?

1341
01:00:56,862 --> 01:01:03,141
(breathing heavily)

1342
01:01:03,176 --> 01:01:04,767
CARTER?

1343
01:01:04,802 --> 01:01:07,220
MELODY?

1344
01:01:07,255 --> 01:01:09,731
HI.
OH, HONEY, YOU GAVE US
QUITE A SCARE.

1345
01:01:09,766 --> 01:01:11,549
OH, WHAT AM I DOING HERE?

1346
01:01:11,585 --> 01:01:13,418
YOU TOOK A FALL
AT THE INN.

1347
01:01:13,453 --> 01:01:15,428
YOU'VE BEEN OUT COLD.

1348
01:01:15,464 --> 01:01:17,113
YOU'VE QUITE A LUMP
ON YOUR HEAD, MS. GERARD.

1349
01:01:17,148 --> 01:01:19,708
GERARD?

1350
01:01:19,743 --> 01:01:22,085
MELODY GERARD?

1351
01:01:22,120 --> 01:01:23,395
MELODY McCLURE.

1352
01:01:23,430 --> 01:01:24,755
EXCUSE ME?

1353
01:01:24,790 --> 01:01:26,465
MELODY McCLURE.

1354
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:28,175
WE'RE MARRIED.

1355
01:01:28,210 --> 01:01:29,367
I'M--I'M SORRY.

1356
01:01:29,403 --> 01:01:31,253
MARRIED?

1357
01:01:31,288 --> 01:01:33,238
INTERESTING.
UH, WHERE DO YOU LIVE?

1358
01:01:33,273 --> 01:01:34,973
ELM STREET?

1359
01:01:35,008 --> 01:01:40,153
OKAY, DOC, I THINK SHE...
MIGHT NEED SOME MORE TESTS.

1360
01:01:40,189 --> 01:01:43,289
OH. (sighs)

1361
01:01:43,324 --> 01:01:44,023
NOT AGAIN.

1362
01:01:51,074 --> 01:01:53,683
YOU THINK...
THAT WE'RE MARRIED?

1363
01:01:53,719 --> 01:01:56,702
YES! NO.

1364
01:01:56,738 --> 01:01:58,821
YES? I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T KNOW.

1365
01:01:58,857 --> 01:02:01,299
I HIT MY HEAD, AND I WOKE UP
IN THE HOSPITAL.

1366
01:02:01,334 --> 01:02:02,976
AND I THOUGHT THAT I WORKED
AT SAVE NOW

1367
01:02:03,011 --> 01:02:04,160
AND LIVED IN CHICAGO.

1368
01:02:04,195 --> 01:02:05,871
YOU DO.

1369
01:02:05,906 --> 01:02:07,797
YES, AND I WAS
CONCEITED AND RUDE.

1370
01:02:07,832 --> 01:02:09,858
YOU ARE.
MEL, YOU'VE BEEN OUT
FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS.

1371
01:02:09,893 --> 01:02:11,209
YOU'VE BEEN DREAMING.

1372
01:02:11,244 --> 01:02:12,860
NO, IT WAS REAL.

1373
01:02:12,896 --> 01:02:15,105
AND YOU WERE THERE,
AND YOU WERE THERE.

1374
01:02:15,107 --> 01:02:17,983
AND YOU WERE THERE.
AND THERE'S NO PLACE LIKE HOME,

1375
01:02:17,985 --> 01:02:19,484
HEY.
AND WE HAD A GREAT BIG
THANKSGIVING DINNER.

1376
01:02:19,519 --> 01:02:22,170
SWEETHEART, THANKSGIVING
ISN'T FOR THREE MORE DAYS.

1377
01:02:22,205 --> 01:02:24,281
YOU JUST GOT HERE ON FRIDAY.

1378
01:02:24,316 --> 01:02:26,191
BUT, OH, I'M JUST SO GLAD
YOU'RE OKAY.

1379
01:02:26,226 --> 01:02:30,711
CAN'T SAY THAT THE REST
OF THE TOWN FEELS THE SAME WAY.

1380
01:02:30,747 --> 01:02:34,132
OKAY, UM, COULD I TALK
TO CARTER ALONE?

1381
01:02:34,167 --> 01:02:38,736
<i>(P.A. tone chimes)</i>

1382
01:02:38,772 --> 01:02:39,588
<i>(woman speaking indistinctly</i>
<i>over P.A.)</i>

1383
01:02:39,623 --> 01:02:44,267
(sighs) IT DIDN'T FEEL LIKE
A DREAM. IT WAS SO REAL.

1384
01:02:44,302 --> 01:02:46,244
(chuckles)

1385
01:02:46,279 --> 01:02:47,737
THAT'S NOT FUNNY.

1386
01:02:47,772 --> 01:02:49,906
NO, ACTUALLY, IT--IT IS
KIND OF FUNNY.

1387
01:02:49,941 --> 01:02:50,715
WELL, I MEAN, NOT THE PART
WHERE YOU GOT HURT.

1388
01:02:50,750 --> 01:02:54,143
BUT SEEING YOU LIKE THIS,
IT'S--IT'S ALMOST THE GIRL

1389
01:02:54,178 --> 01:02:56,262
I REMEMBER BACK WHEN...

1390
01:02:56,297 --> 01:02:58,798
WHAT?

1391
01:02:58,834 --> 01:03:00,249
NEVER MIND. IT WAS LIKE
A HUNDRED YEARS AGO.

1392
01:03:00,285 --> 01:03:02,051
(sighs) OKAY, LOOK.

1393
01:03:02,087 --> 01:03:04,429
I'M SO SORRY THAT
I DIDN'T COME BACK SOONER.

1394
01:03:04,464 --> 01:03:07,474
BUT I'M HERE NOW.

1395
01:03:07,509 --> 01:03:11,586
YOU--YOU HAVE SOME NERVE.

1396
01:03:11,622 --> 01:03:13,446
14 YEARS LATER, YOU--
YOU THINK THAT I'M ACTUALLY

1397
01:03:13,482 --> 01:03:15,565
HOLDING ON TO SOMETHING?

1398
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:17,542
WELL, I AM SO SORRY
TO DISAPPOINT.

1399
01:03:17,544 --> 01:03:20,511
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT WASN'T ALL  <i> MY  </i> FAULT.

1400
01:03:20,547 --> 01:03:22,830
YOU DID NOT CARE
ABOUT MY... FEELINGS.

1401
01:03:22,866 --> 01:03:25,016
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I HAD ASPIRATIONS.

1402
01:03:25,052 --> 01:03:27,844
OH, YOU HAD ASPIRATIONS?
YES, I DID. ASPIRATIONS.

1403
01:03:27,879 --> 01:03:29,487
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
I WASN'T READY THEN.

1404
01:03:29,523 --> 01:03:31,389
BUT I'M READY NOW.

1405
01:03:31,424 --> 01:03:32,174
MEL, W-WAIT.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

1406
01:03:32,209 --> 01:03:34,659
PUTTING ON MY PANTS.
WHAT'S IT LOOK LIKE I'M DOING?
NO, NOT A GOOD IDEA.

1407
01:03:34,694 --> 01:03:36,286
NO, IT IS A GOOD IDEA.
(thud)

1408
01:03:36,321 --> 01:03:37,403
OH, OKAY. THERE IT IS.
SHE'S DOWN.

1409
01:03:37,439 --> 01:03:40,548
I'M OKAY. I'M UP.
LET'S GO.

1410
01:03:40,584 --> 01:03:42,233
LET'S GO TO
THE MAYOR'S OFFICE.
WAIT, WHAT?

1411
01:03:42,268 --> 01:03:44,502
LISTEN, BUDDY.
I FELL FOR YOU.

1412
01:03:44,537 --> 01:03:46,638
LITERALLY, JUST NOW.
FELL FOR YOU.

1413
01:03:46,673 --> 01:03:48,664
SO DON'T BLOW THIS, OKAY?

1414
01:03:48,700 --> 01:03:50,141
YOU ACTUALLY EXPECT ME
TO HELP YOU GET THIS DONE?

1415
01:03:50,176 --> 01:03:53,694
NO, TO STOP IT.
MOVE IT!

1416
01:03:53,730 --> 01:03:55,363
SO WHY THE SUDDEN
CHANGE OF HEART?

1417
01:03:55,399 --> 01:03:56,915
I TOLD YOU,
IT WASN'T SO SUDDEN.

1418
01:03:56,950 --> 01:03:59,892
I GOTTA GET YOU BACK.
YOU--YOU NEED TO SEE A DOCTOR.

1419
01:03:59,928 --> 01:04:01,920
IT WASN'T SO BAD.

1420
01:04:01,955 --> 01:04:04,698
ACTUALLY,
IT WAS PRETTY GREAT.
WHAT?

1421
01:04:04,733 --> 01:04:07,216
JUST BEING BACK.
BEING WITH YOU.

1422
01:04:07,251 --> 01:04:08,743
I SAW YOU LAST FRIDAY.

1423
01:04:08,778 --> 01:04:11,029
AND FOR LIKE AN HOUR
THIS MORNING.

1424
01:04:11,064 --> 01:04:13,031
OKAY, DON'T PLAY COY WITH ME,
CARTER McCLURE.

1425
01:04:13,066 --> 01:04:14,599
I KNOW YOU HAVE MY PILLOW
IN A PLASTIC BAG.

1426
01:04:14,634 --> 01:04:18,077
WAIT, HOLD, HOLD, HOLD.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

1427
01:04:18,112 --> 01:04:19,437
AND YOU MAY OR MAY NOT
HAVE 14-YEAR-OLD MAYO

1428
01:04:19,472 --> 01:04:21,298
IN YOUR REFRIGERATOR?

1429
01:04:21,333 --> 01:04:22,841
YOU'RE DELUSIONAL.
DO YOU KNOW THAT?

1430
01:04:22,876 --> 01:04:24,985
ARE YOU--
ARE YOU ON BATH SALTS?

1431
01:04:24,987 --> 01:04:26,519
THERE IT IS RIGHT THERE--
THAT LOOK IN YOUR EYE.

1432
01:04:26,555 --> 01:04:29,155
I BET YOU EVEN LOOKED UP

1433
01:04:29,157 --> 01:04:31,932
THE DEFINITION OF THE WORD
"MELODY," DIDN'T YOU?

1434
01:04:31,968 --> 01:04:34,719
YEAH, IN YOUR CASE,
IT'S THAT ANNOYING SONG

1435
01:04:34,754 --> 01:04:36,496
SO GRATING ON YOUR NERVES...

1436
01:04:36,531 --> 01:04:38,764
(both) THAT YOU JUST CAN'T
GET IT OUT OF YOUR HEAD.

1437
01:04:38,799 --> 01:04:40,199
I LOVE YOU, TOO,
CARTER.

1438
01:04:44,564 --> 01:04:45,630
NO, I THINK EVERYONE
WILL BE GOOD NEIGHBORS

1439
01:04:45,665 --> 01:04:47,598
ABOUT THIS IN THE END.

1440
01:04:47,634 --> 01:04:48,524
THANK  <i> YOU.</i>
YOU, TOO, SIR. BY.

1441
01:04:48,560 --> 01:04:50,785
SPEAK OF THE DEVIL,

1442
01:04:50,820 --> 01:04:52,495
THAT WAS YOUR BOSS
ON THE PHONE.

1443
01:04:52,530 --> 01:04:54,080
DON'T SEND THE LAND DEEDS.

1444
01:04:54,115 --> 01:04:55,690
OH, I JUST MESSENGERED THEM

1445
01:04:55,726 --> 01:04:56,449
ALL TO THE LAWYERS
THREE MINUTES AGO.

1446
01:04:56,485 --> 01:04:58,660
IT'S A DONE DEAL.

1447
01:04:58,695 --> 01:05:00,295
IT DOESN'T EVEN HAVE TO
GO TO A VOTE.

1448
01:05:00,330 --> 01:05:02,230
CONGRATULATIONS.

1449
01:05:02,265 --> 01:05:04,398
(cell phone vibrates)

1450
01:05:04,434 --> 01:05:05,533
THIS IS MEL.

1451
01:05:05,568 --> 01:05:07,768
MEL? DEAN.

1452
01:05:07,804 --> 01:05:08,978
Nice work.
You got 'em, Hammer.

1453
01:05:09,014 --> 01:05:11,664
Now I need you
to get back in--

1454
01:05:11,700 --> 01:05:13,333
(telephone rings in distance)

1455
01:05:13,368 --> 01:05:16,319
(clanging)

1456
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:22,158
OH,
WHAT DID THE MAYOR SAY?

1457
01:05:24,579 --> 01:05:26,479
WHAT'S THAT?

1458
01:05:26,515 --> 01:05:28,306
"EMINENT DOMAIN."

1459
01:05:28,341 --> 01:05:30,525
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

1460
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:32,477
IF THE CITY DECIDES
IT'S IN THE BEST INTEREST

1461
01:05:32,512 --> 01:05:33,995
OF THE MUNICIPALITY,

1462
01:05:34,030 --> 01:05:35,672
THEY CAN TAKE
WHATEVER THEY WANT.

1463
01:05:35,707 --> 01:05:39,217
THEY CAN TAKE ANYTHING
FROM ANYBODY, LIKE IT OR NOT?

1464
01:05:39,252 --> 01:05:41,519
YEAH.

1465
01:05:41,554 --> 01:05:44,488
SO THEY'RE GOING
TO TEAR DOWN THE INN?

1466
01:05:44,524 --> 01:05:45,940
(sighs)
CAN'T WE STOP THEM?

1467
01:05:45,976 --> 01:05:49,619
NO.

1468
01:05:49,654 --> 01:05:51,696
IT'S OVER. I'M SORRY.

1469
01:05:51,731 --> 01:05:54,107
TOO LITTLE, TOO LATE.

1470
01:05:58,288 --> 01:06:01,323
(clanging over door)

1471
01:06:01,358 --> 01:06:03,074
(door closes)

1472
01:06:13,353 --> 01:06:16,913
YOU OKAY?

1473
01:06:16,948 --> 01:06:19,349
MOM, I SHOULD'VE
BEEN HERE MORE,

1474
01:06:19,351 --> 01:06:22,052
AFTER DAD DIED, TO MAKE SURE
THAT YOU WERE OKAY.

1475
01:06:22,087 --> 01:06:23,311
BUT I DIDN'T.

1476
01:06:23,346 --> 01:06:27,665
I SHOULD'VE COME BACK MORE
OVER ALL THE YEARS AND--

1477
01:06:27,700 --> 01:06:31,602
OH, IT WAS A MISTAKE.
A BIG ONE. I'M SORRY.

1478
01:06:31,637 --> 01:06:34,113
THANK YOU FOR SAYING THAT.
I APPRECIATE IT.

1479
01:06:34,148 --> 01:06:36,149
BUT I UNDERSTOOD.
I KNEW YOU WERE BUSY.

1480
01:06:43,450 --> 01:06:47,685
HEY, DID YOU EVER REGRET
LEAVING CHICAGO?
NEVER.

1481
01:06:47,720 --> 01:06:49,896
YOU GIRLS WANTED A YARD
TO PLAY IN.

1482
01:06:49,931 --> 01:06:51,798
YOUR DADDY AND I
FELL IN LOVE WITH THIS TOWN--

1483
01:06:51,833 --> 01:06:54,050
THE PEOPLE, THE ARCHITECTURE,
THE HISTORY.

1484
01:06:54,085 --> 01:06:57,520
THE FIRST TIME WE EVER VISITED,
WE STAYED RIGHT HERE.

1485
01:06:57,555 --> 01:06:59,122
(chuckles)

1486
01:06:59,157 --> 01:07:00,932
IN CARTER'S INN.

1487
01:07:00,967 --> 01:07:03,451
A WHO'S WHO OF PEOPLE
HAVE STAYED HERE.

1488
01:07:03,486 --> 01:07:06,104
BUILT IN 1870, RIGHT?
YEP.

1489
01:07:06,139 --> 01:07:08,239
YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE I LIKE
ABOUT THIS TOWN?

1490
01:07:08,275 --> 01:07:11,985
ON ALMOST EVERY STREET
THERE IS AN OLD BUILDING

1491
01:07:11,987 --> 01:07:14,654
THAT IF YOU ASK WHAT STOOD
THERE A HUNDRED YEARS AGO,

1492
01:07:14,689 --> 01:07:16,823
IT WOULD BE
THAT SAME BUILDING.

1493
01:07:16,858 --> 01:07:20,018
WE MAY BE OUTNUMBERED
BY THE MONEY PEOPLE

1494
01:07:20,053 --> 01:07:22,896
WHO THINK VALUE
IS IN THE FUTURE,

1495
01:07:22,931 --> 01:07:24,447
BUT THERE IS VALUE
IN THE PAST, TOO.

1496
01:07:27,485 --> 01:07:28,243
CAN I BORROW THESE, MOM?

1497
01:07:28,278 --> 01:07:30,719
SURE.

1498
01:07:30,755 --> 01:07:32,021
SO, WHEN ARE YOU
HEADING OUT?

1499
01:07:32,056 --> 01:07:35,399
(sighs) I THINK THE SOONER
I GET OUT OF DODGE, THE BETTER.

1500
01:07:35,435 --> 01:07:39,045
LOVE YOU.

1501
01:07:41,625 --> 01:07:43,174
(voice breaks) LOVE YOU.

MEL, GOOD TIMING.

1513
01:08:18,787 --> 01:08:21,812
CONGRATULATIONS
AND A GREAT JOB.

1514
01:08:21,848 --> 01:08:25,425
UM, DEAN, I NEED
TO SPEAK TO YOU ALONE.

1515
01:08:25,460 --> 01:08:28,861
IT'S IMPORTANT.

1516
01:08:28,897 --> 01:08:31,005
WHAT DO ALL OF THESE
HAVE IN COMMON?

1517
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:32,473
I DON'T KNOW.
THEY'RE ALL DEAD?

1518
01:08:32,509 --> 01:08:36,361
YES, THAT. BUT WHAT ELSE?

1519
01:08:36,396 --> 01:08:38,404
MOST OF THESE BUILDINGS
ARE STILL THERE.

1520
01:08:38,406 --> 01:08:40,748
THEY MEAN SOMETHING
TO THE PEOPLE THAT LIVE THERE.

1521
01:08:40,784 --> 01:08:42,374
THE--THE PEOPLE THAT
WERE BORN IN THEM,

1522
01:08:42,410 --> 01:08:43,942
THE PEOPLE THAT ARE GONNA
DIE IN THEM.

1523
01:08:43,978 --> 01:08:45,728
WHAT ARE YOU GETTING AT?

1524
01:08:45,763 --> 01:08:47,830
WHAT I'M GETTING--
WHAT I'M SAYING

1525
01:08:47,865 --> 01:08:50,057
IS THEY HAD VALUE
WHEN THEY WERE BUILT.

1526
01:08:50,092 --> 01:08:52,051
THEY STILL HAVE VALUE TODAY.

1527
01:08:52,087 --> 01:08:53,778
DID YOU BUMP YOUR HEAD
OR SOMETHING?

1528
01:08:53,813 --> 01:08:55,621
YES, BUT THAT
IS BESIDES THE POINT.

1529
01:08:55,657 --> 01:08:57,131
THE POINT IS,
IS WE BREAK GROUND

1530
01:08:57,166 --> 01:08:59,224
ON OUR 100th STORE
TOMORROW.

1531
01:08:59,260 --> 01:09:00,935
AND WHAT I'M HEARING
FROM MY HAMMER,

1532
01:09:00,971 --> 01:09:02,027
IS THAT MAYBE
WE OUGHT TO RECONSIDER.

1533
01:09:02,063 --> 01:09:03,812
YES! THESE PEOPLE--

1534
01:09:03,848 --> 01:09:05,339
THESE PEOPLE--
I'M AFRAID TO SAY, MEL--

1535
01:09:05,375 --> 01:09:07,033
ARE GONNA BE
LIKE THESE PEOPLE

1536
01:09:07,068 --> 01:09:09,076
IN THIS PHOTOGRAPH--
DEAD AND GONE.

1537
01:09:09,112 --> 01:09:12,680
PROGRESS LIVES ON.

1538
01:09:12,716 --> 01:09:15,366
OH, AND WHEN
THIS DEAL CLOSES,

1539
01:09:15,402 --> 01:09:17,126
THAT INTERNATIONAL
POSITION'S YOURS.

1540
01:09:17,161 --> 01:09:20,196
HEAD OF OVERSEAS DEVELOPMENT?

1541
01:09:20,231 --> 01:09:22,782
YOU'RE GIVING ME
THE POSITION?

1542
01:09:22,817 --> 01:09:23,774
YEAH, SHARK LIKE YOU,
NO KIDS,

1543
01:09:23,810 --> 01:09:25,876
NOTHING TO TIE YOU DOWN.

1544
01:09:25,912 --> 01:09:27,153
YOU'RE THE PERFECT PERSON
FOR THE JOB.

1545
01:09:29,707 --> 01:09:31,774
(telephone ringing in distance)

1546
01:09:31,809 --> 01:09:36,454
(sighs)

1547
01:09:36,489 --> 01:09:37,513
YOUR ITINERARY.

1548
01:09:37,548 --> 01:09:40,675
ITINERARY?

1549
01:09:40,710 --> 01:09:43,494
THE BAHAMAS.
AND CONGRATULATIONS

1550
01:09:43,529 --> 01:09:45,788
ON THE INTERNATIONAL GIG.

1551
01:09:45,823 --> 01:09:47,298
I ALWAYS KNEW YOU
WOULD GET IT.

1552
01:09:50,870 --> 01:09:52,971
THANKS.

1553
01:09:53,006 --> 01:09:54,639

1554

<i>(dance music playing)</i>

1555
01:09:59,946 --> 01:10:02,981
AND THEN HE SAYS,
"OH, MY GIRLFRIEND

1556
01:10:03,016 --> 01:10:04,857
GAVE IT TO ME."

1557
01:10:04,893 --> 01:10:07,510
(chuckles)
AND I'M LIKE, REALLY?

1558
01:10:07,545 --> 01:10:10,371
I JUST SPENT 45
OF THE BEST FLIRTING MINUTES

1559
01:10:10,406 --> 01:10:12,106
OF MY LIFE
AND NOW YOU TELL ME

1560
01:10:12,141 --> 01:10:14,884
YOU'VE GOT
A FREAKING GIRLFRIEND?

1561
01:10:14,919 --> 01:10:17,286
HELLO, EARTH TO MEL?

1562
01:10:17,321 --> 01:10:19,330
YEAH?

1563
01:10:19,365 --> 01:10:21,132
WHERE ARE YOU?

1564
01:10:21,167 --> 01:10:25,119
I'M RIGHT HERE...
WHERE WE ALWAYS ARE.

1565
01:10:25,154 --> 01:10:27,597
OH, I'M SORRY.
ARE WE BORING YOU?

1566
01:10:27,632 --> 01:10:30,799
WHAT DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT DREAMS?

1567
01:10:30,835 --> 01:10:32,427
WHAT, LIKE, FAILED ONES?

1568
01:10:32,462 --> 01:10:34,011
IT WAS SO REAL.

1569
01:10:34,047 --> 01:10:37,006
IT WAS LIKE
IT WASN'T A DREAM.

1570
01:10:37,041 --> 01:10:39,075
IT WAS LIKE
I WAS REALLY THERE.

1571
01:10:39,110 --> 01:10:41,552
BUT I WASN'T. WAS I?

1572
01:10:41,587 --> 01:10:44,055
WAS I?

1573
01:10:44,090 --> 01:10:46,974
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

1574
01:10:47,010 --> 01:10:48,910
COME ON, WE LEAVE TOMORROW
FOR THE BAHAMAS.

1575
01:10:48,945 --> 01:10:50,786
YOU'RE ACTING LIKE
WE'RE AT A FUNERAL.

1576
01:10:50,821 --> 01:10:52,146
AND YOU JUST
GOT A PROMOTION.

1577
01:10:52,182 --> 01:10:54,015
WHAT COULD YOU
POSSIBLY BE DEPRESSED ABOUT?

1578
01:10:54,050 --> 01:10:57,434
I'LL SEE YOU GUYS

WHAT ARE YOU STILL
DOING HERE?

1608
01:12:56,464 --> 01:12:58,222
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
ON A FLIGHT TO THE BAHAMAS.

1609
01:12:58,257 --> 01:13:01,183
UH, NO, I, UM
HAVE A COUPLE HOURS.

WELL, I'D RATHER STILL
SEE YOU AT THE CEREMONY.

A VERY FORGIVING MOOD.

1621
01:13:21,531 --> 01:13:22,880
I AM WORKING ON IT.

1622
01:13:22,915 --> 01:13:25,357
DON'T START UNTIL I SAY SO.

1623

BUT I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT, OKAY?

1630
01:13:46,405 --> 01:13:48,414
SO CALL ME BACK.

YOU DO KNOW
TOMORROW'S THANKSGIVING?

1633
01:14:01,553 --> 01:14:03,487
YES, I'M AWARE OF THAT.

1634
01:14:03,523 --> 01:14:05,231
WE USUALLY LIKE
TO CLOSE EARLY

1635
01:14:05,266 --> 01:14:06,816
THE DAY

GIVE US MORE TIME
TO PREPARE

1637

I CAN'T--I CAN'T EVEN GET IN
TO FINISH GETTING MY STUFF OUT.

1646
01:14:33,636 --> 01:14:35,936
IT'S A REAL NICE COMPANY

DON'T LET THEM
TOUCH THE INN, OKAY?

1661
01:15:01,455 --> 01:15:03,013
DO WHATEVER IT TAKES.

1662
01:15:03,048 --> 01:15:04,072
TELL THEM
TO STALL THE BULLDOZERS.

1663
01:15:04,108 --> 01:15:05,566

1675
01:15:35,798 --> 01:15:37,690
THEY'RE NOT
GONNA BULLDOZE A KID.

1676

AUNT CHRISSY!
UNCLE JIMMY! HERE!

1692
01:16:51,090 --> 01:16:53,340
WE GOT MORE.
COME ON!

1693
01:16:53,376 --> 01:16:54,775
AWESOME, YOU'RE AWESOME.
YOU'RE FANTASTIC.

1694
01:16:54,810 --> 01:16:56,652
THANK YOU,
THANK YOU, COME ON!

1695
01:16:56,687 --> 01:16:59,046
SAVE NOW DOES NOT CARE!

1696
01:16:59,081 --> 01:17:01,207
(chanting)
SAVE NOW DOES NOT CARE!

1697
01:17:01,242 --> 01:17:02,525
(cell phone vibrates)

1698
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:04,051
HELLO?

1699
01:17:04,087 --> 01:17:07,271
MEL? WHERE ARE YOU?

1700
01:17:07,306 --> 01:17:08,505
THE FLIGHT LEAVES
IN 30 MINUTES.

1701
01:17:08,540 --> 01:17:10,257
I CAN'T GO.

1702
01:17:10,293 --> 01:17:12,159
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

1703
01:17:12,195 --> 01:17:13,995
THIS WAS YOUR IDEA.
WE NEED YOU!

1704
01:17:14,030 --> 01:17:15,329
NO, YOU DON'T.

1705
01:17:15,365 --> 01:17:16,797
BUT THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE
WHO DO.

1706
01:17:16,832 --> 01:17:18,015
(cell phone vibrating)

1707
01:17:18,050 --> 01:17:20,518
I'M SORRY.

1708
01:17:20,553 --> 01:17:21,835
I HAVE TO TAKE THIS.

1709
01:17:21,871 --> 01:17:24,955
WAIT, YOU CAN'T DO THIS.

1710
01:17:24,990 --> 01:17:27,107
HELLO?

1711
01:17:27,143 --> 01:17:28,459
(crowd chanting)
MEL, I THOUGHT YOU SAID

1712
01:17:28,494 --> 01:17:29,618
YOU HAD THESE PEOPLE
UNDER CONTROL.

1713
01:17:29,653 --> 01:17:31,579
(sighs) I'M STILL IN CHICAGO.

1714
01:17:31,614 --> 01:17:33,906
I WILL BE THERE IN 30 MINUTES,
OKAY? JUST WAIT.

1715
01:17:33,941 --> 01:17:36,358
(chanting continues)

1716
01:17:36,393 --> 01:17:39,228
WELL, EVERYTHING
LOOKS IN ORDER.

1717
01:17:39,263 --> 01:17:40,121
PERFECT, OKAY, GREAT.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

1718
01:17:40,156 --> 01:17:41,296
I NEED TO GET GOING.

1719
01:17:41,331 --> 01:17:43,866
THERE'S JUST ONE MORE THING.

1720
01:17:43,901 --> 01:17:46,568
ALL THIS PAPERWORK
THAT YOU FILLED OUT,

1721
01:17:46,603 --> 01:17:47,844
AND ALL THIS PAPERWORK
THAT I FILLED OUT...

1722
01:17:47,879 --> 01:17:49,230
RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT.

1723
01:17:49,265 --> 01:17:50,355
IT'S GOING TO TAKE 30 DAYS.

1724
01:17:50,390 --> 01:17:52,500
WHAT?

1725
01:17:52,535 --> 01:17:54,526
IT TAKES 30 DAYS BEFORE
THE REVIEW BOARD

1726
01:17:54,562 --> 01:17:55,736
CAN FINALIZE A NOMINATION
OF THIS MAGNITUDE.

1727
01:17:55,771 --> 01:17:57,963
NO, NO.

1728
01:17:57,998 --> 01:17:59,665
THE INN IS SET TO BE DEMOLISHED
AT 3:00.

1729
01:17:59,700 --> 01:18:02,109
WELL, THE ONLY WAY TO STOP IT
IS TO FILE AN INJUCTION

1730
01:18:02,144 --> 01:18:03,302
WITH JUDGE STANTON
AND, UH,

1731
01:18:03,337 --> 01:18:06,097
GOVERNMENT OFFICES
ARE CLOSING.

1732
01:18:06,099 --> 01:18:08,474
OKAY, WHERE IS
JUDGE STANTON'S OFFICE?
UP ON 3.

1733
01:18:08,509 --> 01:18:09,616
(singsongy)
BUT HE USUALLY LEAVES EARLY!

1734
01:18:09,652 --> 01:18:10,551
OKAY, THANKS A LOT!

1735
01:18:17,267 --> 01:18:20,519
AH, EXCUSE ME!
JUDGE STANTON.

1736
01:18:20,554 --> 01:18:25,633
HI.
I AM NOT JUDGE STANTON AGAIN
UNTIL MONDAY MORNING AT 9:00.

1737
01:18:25,668 --> 01:18:27,142
I JUST REALLY NEED YOU
TO ISSUE AN INJUCTION.

1738
01:18:27,177 --> 01:18:28,519
UH, WE'RE CLOSED.

1739
01:18:28,554 --> 01:18:30,371
NO, I STILL HAVE
ONE MINUTE. SEE?

1740
01:18:30,406 --> 01:18:31,605
HOLD ON.
(cell phone vibrating)

1741
01:18:31,640 --> 01:18:33,732
SORRY.

1742
01:18:33,767 --> 01:18:35,968
HELLO?

1743
01:18:36,003 --> 01:18:38,270
(crowd chanting)
MEL, YOU'RE NOT HERE
WITHIN THE NEXT TEN MINUTES,

1744
01:18:38,305 --> 01:18:39,096
THIS WHOLE THING'S
GONNA GO SOUTH.

1745
01:18:39,131 --> 01:18:41,190
I TOLD YOU,

1746
01:18:41,225 --> 01:18:42,424
I AM GETTING
THE PROPER PAPERWORK.

1747
01:18:42,459 --> 01:18:44,309
IF YOU CALL ME
ONE MORE TIME,

1748
01:18:44,345 --> 01:18:45,761
I WILL PERSONALLY
RIP YOUR PANTS OFF

1749
01:18:45,796 --> 01:18:47,212
AND SHOVE THEM
WHERE THE SUN--

1750
01:18:47,248 --> 01:18:50,491
I'M ASSUMING--
HAS NEVER SHINED.

1751
01:18:50,526 --> 01:18:53,169
(chanting)
SAVE NOW DOES NOT CARE!

1752
01:18:53,204 --> 01:18:56,480
SAVE NOW DOES NOT CARE!
SAVE NOW--

1753
01:18:56,482 --> 01:18:59,199
PLEASE, JUDGE. JUDGE.
JUST TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.

1754
01:18:59,235 --> 01:19:00,984
TOMORROW'S THANKSGIVING.
YES.

1755
01:19:01,020 --> 01:19:03,270
WE'RE CLOSED.

1756
01:19:03,305 --> 01:19:05,155
I KNOW, BUT IF YOU
UNDERSTAND THE MEANING

1757
01:19:05,190 --> 01:19:07,290
OF THANKSGIVING
EVEN JUST A LITTLE BIT,

1758
01:19:07,326 --> 01:19:09,434
THE PEOPLE OF STREETSVILLE,
A LOVELY LITTLE TOWN

1759
01:19:09,470 --> 01:19:11,028
JUST SOUTHWEST OF HERE,
WILL BE VERY THANKFUL

1760
01:19:11,063 --> 01:19:12,780
IF YOU HELP ME.

1761
01:19:16,585 --> 01:19:19,503
(muttering)

1762
01:19:19,538 --> 01:19:21,429
(chuckles) I'M SORRY.
IT'S STILL 30 DAYS.

1763
01:19:21,465 --> 01:19:23,015
NO, OKAY, OKAY.
WAIT, WAIT.

1764
01:19:23,050 --> 01:19:24,325
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.

1765
01:19:24,360 --> 01:19:26,585
DOES THIS CHANGE YOUR MIND?

1766
01:19:31,275 --> 01:19:33,150
(chanting)
SAVE NOW DOES NOT CARE!

1767
01:19:33,186 --> 01:19:37,321
MR. WILCOX, SHE SAID 30 MINUTES
30 MINUTES AGO.

1768
01:19:37,356 --> 01:19:40,891
I KNOW, WHATEVER IT IS,
WE'LL FIGURE A WAY AROUND IT.
OKAY.

1769
01:19:40,926 --> 01:19:44,027
(engine revving)

1770
01:19:44,062 --> 01:19:45,862
SAVE NOW DOES NOT CARE!

1771
01:19:45,898 --> 01:19:48,348
IT'S GO. GO!

1772
01:19:48,384 --> 01:19:52,502
(bulldozer whirring)
SAVE NOW DOES NOT CARE!

1773
01:19:52,538 --> 01:19:56,548
SAVE NOW DOES NOT CARE!
SAVE NOW DOES NOT CARE!

1774
01:19:56,583 --> 01:19:58,325
GET READY.

1775
01:19:58,361 --> 01:20:00,368
COME ON, COME ON,
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

1776
01:20:00,404 --> 01:20:03,539
OH, YEAH. OKAY.
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

1777
01:20:19,048 --> 01:20:20,889
(shouting)
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

1778
01:20:24,637 --> 01:20:27,029
IT'S ALL RIGHT,
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

1779
01:20:27,064 --> 01:20:27,855
HE'S NOT GONNA DO IT.

1780
01:20:30,300 --> 01:20:32,468
(Stacy) MEL! MEL!

1781
01:20:32,503 --> 01:20:34,219
(brakes squeal)
HERE SHE IS,
HERE SHE IS.

1782
01:20:34,254 --> 01:20:38,782
WAIT, WAIT!
STOP, STOP!

1783
01:20:38,817 --> 01:20:40,534
(whistle blows)

1784
01:20:45,608 --> 01:20:49,317
WE HAVE TO STOP.
WE CAN'T DEMOLISH THE INN.

1785
01:20:49,353 --> 01:20:52,204
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

1786
01:20:52,239 --> 01:20:56,032
(sighs)
HERE, LOOK AT THIS PHOTO.

1787
01:20:56,068 --> 01:20:57,709
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

1788
01:20:57,744 --> 01:20:59,019
LOOK AT THE MAN.

1789
01:20:59,054 --> 01:21:00,896
THE MAN IN THE MIDDLE.

1790
01:21:00,931 --> 01:21:02,381
THAT MAN IS MARK TWAIN.

1791
01:21:02,416 --> 01:21:03,515
HE WAS ONCE PART OWNER
OF THIS INN

1792
01:21:03,551 --> 01:21:05,592
OVER A HUNDRED YEARS AGO.

1793
01:21:05,628 --> 01:21:07,686
THAT QUALIFIES THIS
AS A HISTORIC LANDMARK.

1794
01:21:11,550 --> 01:21:13,601
I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND.

1795
01:21:13,636 --> 01:21:16,595
WE TOUCH THAT INN,
THEY SHUT US DOWN.

1796
01:21:16,630 --> 01:21:18,105
YOU KNOW ACCORDING
TO OUR LAND SURVEY,

1797
01:21:18,140 --> 01:21:19,690
THAT THIS IS THE ONLY SITE

1798
01:21:19,725 --> 01:21:21,241
THAT SUITS
OUR CONSTRUCTION PLANS.

1799
01:21:21,277 --> 01:21:24,703
I'M AFRAID THIS STORE
IS D.O.A.

1800
01:21:24,738 --> 01:21:26,555
I'LL FIGHT IT.

1801
01:21:26,591 --> 01:21:28,323
I DON'T THINK THIS IS A FIGHT
WE CAN WIN, DEAN.

1802
01:21:28,358 --> 01:21:29,658
WE  <i> ALWAYS  </i> WIN, MEL.

1803
01:21:29,693 --> 01:21:31,552
DO WE?

1804
01:21:31,587 --> 01:21:34,146
WE TALK ABOUT VALUE A LOT
TO OUR CUSTOMERS

1805
01:21:34,181 --> 01:21:36,247
AND OUR COMMUNITIES.

1806
01:21:36,283 --> 01:21:38,049
I'M WONDERING IF WE NEED
TO LOOK THE WORD UP.

1807
01:21:38,085 --> 01:21:41,595
I KNOW I HAD TO. (sighs)

1808
01:21:41,631 --> 01:21:42,946
"VALUE, THE REGARD
THAT SOMETHING

1809
01:21:42,981 --> 01:21:44,698
"IS HELD TO DESERVE.

1810
01:21:44,734 --> 01:21:47,610
"A PERSON'S PRINCIPLES
OR STANDARDS OF BEHAVIOR.

1811
01:21:47,612 --> 01:21:50,687
ONE'S JUDGMENT OF WHAT ONE
IS THANKFUL FOR IN LIFE."

1812
01:21:53,717 --> 01:21:55,942
IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT DOLLARS,
DEAN.

1813
01:21:55,977 --> 01:21:58,779
IT'S ABOUT PEOPLE, FAMILIES,
A WAY OF LIFE.

1814
01:21:58,814 --> 01:22:01,573
WE LOSE SIGHT OF THAT,
WE LOSE EVERYTHING.

1815
01:22:09,158 --> 01:22:10,457
MEL?

1816
01:22:14,913 --> 01:22:18,265
YOU'RE FIRED.

1817
01:22:18,300 --> 01:22:21,968
OH, I DON'T THINK SO.

1818
01:22:22,003 --> 01:22:25,797
I THINK SHE'S MAKING
QUITE A POINT HERE.

1819
01:22:25,833 --> 01:22:27,290
AND I THINK MS. GERARD
HAS A BRIGHT FUTURE

1820
01:22:27,326 --> 01:22:28,900
WITH THIS COMPANY.

1821
01:22:28,935 --> 01:22:30,051
THANK YOU, MS. BRADLEY,

1822
01:22:30,087 --> 01:22:32,888
BUT I THINK I HAVE FALLEN
IN LOVE WITH STREETSVILLE...

1823
01:22:32,923 --> 01:22:35,215
AGAIN.

1824
01:22:35,250 --> 01:22:37,426
WELL, I GUESS
THAT'S WHAT I MEAN.

1825
01:22:37,461 --> 01:22:39,653
WE PRIDE OURSELVES
ON IMPROVING JOB SERVICES,

1826
01:22:39,688 --> 01:22:42,155
A PARTNERSHIP WITH COMMUNITIES
LIKE THIS.

1827
01:22:42,191 --> 01:22:43,357
WOULDN'T YOU AGREE,
MR. WILCOX?

1828
01:22:43,392 --> 01:22:45,091
YES, MS. BRADLEY.

1829
01:22:45,127 --> 01:22:46,877
BUT NOT WHEN IT'S NOT NEEDED.

1830
01:22:46,879 --> 01:22:49,563
AND MOST IMPORTANTLY,
NOT WHEN IT'S NOT WANTED.

1831
01:22:49,598 --> 01:22:50,864
I THINK YOU'D AGREE WITH THAT,
TOO, MR. WILCOX?

1832
01:22:50,899 --> 01:22:52,491
MM-HMM.

1833
01:22:52,526 --> 01:22:54,217
SOMEONE LIKE YOU
HAS A GREAT DEAL

1834
01:22:54,252 --> 01:22:55,652
TO OFFER OUR COMPANY.

1835
01:22:55,687 --> 01:22:58,271
ACTUALLY, I DO.
I'VE BEEN THINKING

1836
01:22:58,307 --> 01:23:00,766
OF PUTTING TOGETHER
A BUSINESS PROPOSAL

1837
01:23:00,801 --> 01:23:02,743
TO EXPAND MY MOM'S CAFE
TO OTHER CITIES.

1838
01:23:02,778 --> 01:23:07,606
LOCAL PRODUCE, FAMILY RECIPES,
BUT THEY COULD BE EXCLUSIVE

1839
01:23:07,641 --> 01:23:09,374
INSIDE SAVE NOW STORES.

1840
01:23:09,409 --> 01:23:11,659
AH, I'D LIKE TO SEE
YOUR PROSPECTUS.

1841
01:23:11,695 --> 01:23:13,145
I'LL HAVE IT TO YOU
NEXT WEEK.

1842
01:23:26,718 --> 01:23:30,411
I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO THANK YOU, MEL.

1843
01:23:30,447 --> 01:23:33,123
YOU CAN CALL ME "MELODY."

1844
01:23:35,536 --> 01:23:38,712
(crowd cheering)

1845
01:23:40,316 --> 01:23:42,632
(Carter) WOO-HOO!

1846
01:23:44,728 --> 01:23:46,111
(indistinct chatter)

1847
01:23:46,146 --> 01:23:47,546
(Carter) BACK IT UP!

1848
01:23:47,581 --> 01:23:49,681
(indistinct conversations)

1849
01:23:49,717 --> 01:23:52,109
HEY, I'M COMING IN.
LOOK OUT.

1850
01:23:52,111 --> 01:23:54,694
OH, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
LET ME GRAB IT. I GOT IT.

1851
01:23:54,729 --> 01:23:56,755
(all speaking at once)

1852
01:23:56,790 --> 01:23:59,208
I AM GOING TO KNOCK
SOMETHING OVER. (laughs)

1853
01:23:59,243 --> 01:24:00,617
THIS IS GREAT, MOM.

1854
01:24:00,652 --> 01:24:01,785
OKAY.
REALLY GOOD.

1855
01:24:01,820 --> 01:24:04,504
I'VE GOT THIS. ANYTHING ELSE?
ANYTHING? ANYTHING?

1856
01:24:04,540 --> 01:24:06,189
I'VE GOT TOMATOES.
ALL RIGHT, HONEY,

1857
01:24:06,224 --> 01:24:07,474
GET THOSE CRANBERRIES IN.

1858
01:24:07,509 --> 01:24:09,309
YOU KNOW HOW I LOVE
MY PRESENTATIONS,

1859
01:24:09,344 --> 01:24:10,660
AND I'VE GOTTA HAVE
