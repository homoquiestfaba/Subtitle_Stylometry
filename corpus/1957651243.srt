363
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:47,131
- This time trouble found me.

364
00:32:48,366 --> 00:32:50,768
- Well, nobody's gonna
grow old in this town.

365
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:52,070
- Looks like you will.

366
00:32:53,371 --> 00:32:55,673
(chuckling)

367
00:32:57,742 --> 00:32:59,010
- Have you been clean?

368
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:03,081
- Five months.

369
00:33:05,116 --> 00:33:05,750
- Five months?

370
00:33:07,185 --> 00:33:09,654
Wow.

371
00:33:09,687 --> 00:33:12,223
What is that silver
shit on your eyes?

372
00:33:13,558 --> 00:33:15,526
- They're glitters.

373
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:18,262
So I'm pretty when I'm singing.

374
00:33:18,296 --> 00:33:21,032
- Oh, well I'll have to
come and hear you sing.

375
00:33:22,266 --> 00:33:25,670
- You wouldn't like it,
you like Perry Como.

376
00:33:27,305 --> 00:33:28,373
- I do like Perry Como.

377
00:33:28,406 --> 00:33:31,442
I've decided the world is
divided into two parts:

378
00:33:31,476 --> 00:33:34,579
those that like Neil Diamond,
and those that don't; I don't.

379
00:33:35,713 --> 00:33:37,448
- I love Neil Diamond.

380
00:33:38,583 --> 00:33:41,452
- You would; I
have some questions

381
00:33:41,486 --> 00:33:42,653
I have to ask you again.

382
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:46,324
- I don't know anything.

383
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:47,759
- I think you do.

384
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:50,661
When you were
singing in your act,

385
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:52,730
you yelled out a
warning to somebody.

386
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:56,601
- I don't know where you
get your information.

387
00:33:56,634 --> 00:33:57,668
- Who is Billy?

388
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:00,638
- Billy.

389
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:04,742
Maybe I was singing
Ode to Billy Joe?

390
00:34:06,677 --> 00:34:08,146
- I don't think so.

391
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:09,781
It was a lousy song
when it came out

392
00:34:09,814 --> 00:34:12,517
and it's still a lousy
song, you wouldn't sing it.

393
00:34:14,786 --> 00:34:15,620
- Dakota.

394
00:34:17,622 --> 00:34:19,223
I've always liked you.

395
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:22,460
- I know.
- For an American pig.

396
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:27,832
But giving people up,
that's just not my style.

397
00:34:27,865 --> 00:34:28,699
You know that.

398
00:34:30,868 --> 00:34:33,371
Besides, it could be
bad for my health.

399
00:34:35,173 --> 00:34:37,141
You get to go home
when this is over.

400
00:34:40,445 --> 00:34:41,813
- I don't have a home to go to.

401
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:46,350
Things are gettin' out of
hand, even for this place.

402
00:34:47,552 --> 00:34:50,721
- Things have been out
of hand my whole life.

403
00:34:57,195 --> 00:34:59,730
Look, I know they
can't keep me here.

404
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:03,401
So do me a favor and tell the
nurse to get my paperwork.

405
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:04,502
I'm just gonna split.

406
00:35:07,338 --> 00:35:08,172
- Okay.

409

410
00:35:18,749 --> 00:35:20,418
- Being clean all that time.

411
00:35:22,553 --> 00:35:24,589
- That's something, isn't it?

412
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:26,724

Apologize.

430
00:36:54,078 --> 00:36:55,413
- I'm sorry.

431
00:36:55,446 --> 00:36:57,548

imbecile, to her

432
00:36:57,582 --> 00:36:58,382

- I'm Austrian, we don't eat
sauerkraut, we eat strudel.

438
00:37:19,704 --> 00:37:21,505
- Whatever, what do you got?

439
00:37:21,539 --> 00:37:25,343
- Female, 23 years old,
naturalistic style.

440
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:26,010
She's all cut up.

441
00:37:27,812 --> 00:37:29,614
I got a snitch that
works downtown.

442
00:37:29,647 --> 00:37:32,550
He told me a guy named Crazy Six

443
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:34,285
has done an arms
dealer yesterday.

444
00:37:35,453 --> 00:37:37,021
Crazy Six and the
stiff are partners.

445
00:37:38,856 --> 00:37:40,024
- Crazy Six.

446
00:37:41,993 --> 00:37:44,729
He's like a smallpox carrier.

00:37:53,971 --> 00:37:54,972
- Who's Kelsey Nuts?

450
00:37:56,907 --> 00:37:58,676
- I don't know, I never
knew what that meant.

451
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:01,846
- Oh. (sighs)

452
00:38:01,879 --> 00:38:04,115
Word is, Raul doesn't
recover his product

453
00:38:04,148 --> 00:38:05,816
in 48 hours, he's history.

454
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:10,688
Now I'd like to put
Crazy Six on a leash,

455
00:38:10,721 --> 00:38:13,457
and let Raul try to
recover his drugs and cash.

456
00:38:13,491 --> 00:38:15,593
You might finally catch
the bastard dirty.

457
00:38:16,894 --> 00:38:18,095
- You've been with
my partner too long,

458
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:19,430
you're gettin' smart.

459
00:38:20,865 --> 00:38:22,099
You got this Billy staked out?

460
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:24,001

01:08:43,219 --> 01:08:44,220
Fucking look at you.

It's all under control.

(exclaiming)
(groaning)

818
01:13:34,843 --> 01:13:37,813
- Fucking kill!
- Where the fuck is it?

819
01:13:37,846 --> 01:13:40,115
Do you wanna die here?
(rumbling)

820
01:13:40,149 --> 01:13:41,583
Do you wanna fuckin' die here?

821
01:13:41,617 --> 01:13:42,951
Tell me where it is.

(guns click)

828
01:14:11,113 --> 01:14:12,714
- Yeah, go for it.

829
01:14:14,016 --> 01:14:15,017
I want you to.

830
01:14:16,118 --> 01:14:19,188
But before you do, can I
tell you a couple things?

831
01:14:20,689 --> 01:14:22,691
(wind roaring faintly)

832
01:14:22,724 --> 01:14:23,792
I'm over 50.

833
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:26,962
I ate a sandwich older
than you yesterday.

834
01:14:28,964 --> 01:14:31,133
I hurt all the time.

835
01:14:32,868 --> 01:14:36,138
I got 42 broken bones,
I've been shot twice,

836
01:14:36,171 --> 01:14:37,639
I don't have a spleen.

837
01:14:37,673 --> 01:14:39,808
But you wanna know
what hurts the most?

838
01:14:41,176 --> 01:14:42,678
They took away my son.

839
01:14:45,180 --> 01:14:46,982
They took away my son.

840
01:14:48,150 --> 01:14:51,787
So you see, I don't give a shit.

841
01:14:54,289 --> 01:14:56,225
You wanna go for it?

842
01:14:56,258 --> 01:14:57,526
Let's go for it.

843
01:15:00,229 --> 01:15:03,932
- Raul's got my girl, he
wants to make a trade.

844
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:05,834
- Raul?

845
01:15:08,637 --> 01:15:11,740
I wouldn't trust Raul if
his balls were on fire

846
01:15:11,773 --> 01:15:13,175
and I had a bucket of water.

847
01:15:14,276 --> 01:15:16,945
(wind roaring faintly)

848
01:15:16,979 --> 01:15:17,880
But I'll take him with you.

849
01:15:19,248 --> 01:15:21,884
(rock music)

850
01:15:23,252 --> 01:15:24,987
- [Andrew] Dirty
Mao ripped us off.

851
01:15:29,191 --> 01:15:31,193
- [Dakota] It's no good.

852
01:15:38,267 --> 01:15:40,702
- [Anna] I need a chance.

853
01:15:40,736 --> 01:15:42,304
- [Billy] To success.

854
01:15:43,372 --> 01:15:45,173
- [Man] I sent you.

855
01:15:47,009 --> 01:15:48,844
- [Billy] Look at you.

856
01:15:49,878 --> 01:15:53,815
(speaking in foreign language)

857
01:15:56,251 --> 01:15:57,319
- [Anna] Billy.

858
01:15:59,254 --> 01:16:00,689
I just cause pain.

859
01:16:01,790 --> 01:16:06,028
(ominous music)
(wordless vocalizing)

860
01:16:06,061 --> 01:16:07,996
- [Billy] I wanna stop.

861
01:16:09,965 --> 01:16:13,802
(singing in foreign language)

862
01:16:15,170 --> 01:16:17,773
(guns click)

863
01:16:17,806 --> 01:16:19,174
- Where's my stuff?

864
01:16:20,842 --> 01:16:22,144
- It's in the car.

865
01:16:28,884 --> 01:16:31,420
(door latch clicks)
(car door bangs)

866
01:16:31,453 --> 01:16:34,323
(ominous music)

867
01:16:39,728 --> 01:16:42,197
(keys jingling)

868
01:17:03,218 --> 01:17:04,252
- Anna?

869
01:17:06,154 --> 01:17:08,023
- Yeah, looks a
little fucked up.

870
01:17:08,056 --> 01:17:09,891
She's been havin'
a good time, man.

871
01:17:09,925 --> 01:17:11,727
She's feeling really
good right now.

872
01:17:14,296 --> 01:17:15,130
- Let her go.

873
01:17:17,165 --> 01:17:19,234
- Go on, wanna go to
your little boyfriend?

874
01:17:19,267 --> 01:17:21,336
Come on, go on, it's okay.

875
01:17:25,941 --> 01:17:27,342
Or do you want another hit?

876
01:17:28,343 --> 01:17:31,346
(ominous music)

877
01:17:31,380 --> 01:17:34,349
Yeah man, we all
got a death wish.

878
01:17:46,428 --> 01:17:49,331
(gunshots booming)

879
01:17:55,070 --> 01:17:56,938
(ominous music)

880
01:17:56,972 --> 01:17:57,773
- Let's do it.

881
01:17:59,808 --> 01:18:03,211
- Come on, I'm ready, I like
my odds, let's get down.

882
01:18:05,781 --> 01:18:07,816
(gunshot booming)
(yelling)

883
01:18:07,849 --> 01:18:10,452
(clattering)
(guns click)

884
01:18:10,485 --> 01:18:11,787
- 29 to two.

885
01:18:13,422 --> 01:18:15,090
I like these odds better.

886
01:18:16,391 --> 01:18:19,294
- If I'ma die, it's
the cops we're bustin'.

887
01:18:19,327 --> 01:18:20,395
- Let's cut the bullshit.

888
01:18:21,797 --> 01:18:24,733
Let's get on with
it, cowboy style.

889
01:18:26,234 --> 01:18:29,538
- I like your style, Detective,
I really like his style.

890
01:18:29,571 --> 01:18:34,776
(gunshots booming)
(dramatic music)

891
01:18:43,318 --> 01:18:47,255
(speaking in foreign language)

892
01:19:06,241 --> 01:19:09,177
(light rock music)

893
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:35,470
(eerie music)

894
01:19:35,504 --> 01:19:36,338
- Billy.

895
01:19:39,941 --> 01:19:42,210
Thank you for taking
care of the competition.

896
01:19:43,445 --> 01:19:47,516
(breathing heavily and groaning)

897
01:19:50,152 --> 01:19:51,219
(gun clicks)

898
01:19:51,253 --> 01:19:54,489
- Now it's just like the
movies, Mexican standoff.

899
01:19:54,523 --> 01:19:56,925
(breathing heavily)

900
01:19:56,958 --> 01:19:58,493
Except no one ever shoots.

901
01:19:59,961 --> 01:20:02,564
(exclaiming)
(gunshot booming)

902
01:20:02,597 --> 01:20:05,300
(eerie music)

903
01:20:10,505 --> 01:20:13,008
(Billy gasps)

904
01:20:19,614 --> 01:20:21,550
- You might need this.

905
01:20:21,583 --> 01:20:24,920
Since you decided to kill
Raul and rip everybody off,

906
01:20:24,953 --> 01:20:27,289
I think maybe some people
come look for you, huh?
