00:00:01,035 --> 00:00:01,380
- I'm telling you,
that's the kinda shit

2
00:00:01,725 --> 00:00:02,864
that killed Hammer's career.

3
00:00:02,864 --> 00:00:04,383
- The rapper?

4
00:00:04,383 --> 00:00:06,627
- I'm not talking about Arm
and Hammer, motherfucker.

5
00:00:06,627 --> 00:00:08,111
Bust shit.

6
00:00:08,111 --> 00:00:10,665
Hammer was one of those Frisco
roughnecks first, right?

7
00:00:10,665 --> 00:00:12,150
That was his image.

8
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:14,669
Then he put on them big
Sinbad the Sailor pants

9
00:00:14,669 --> 00:00:15,912
and went bare chested,

10
00:00:15,912 --> 00:00:17,776
calling himself an
entertainer, right?

11
00:00:17,776 --> 00:00:19,053
That means pop.

12
00:00:19,053 --> 00:00:20,813
Clearly a crossover move.

13
00:00:20,813 --> 00:00:23,368
Can't fault the man for
reinventing himself as per the

14
00:00:23,368 --> 00:00:26,578
market trends, shit, I
close this joint down

15
00:00:26,578 --> 00:00:29,305
and trade in them spears
and masks for ninja outfits

16
00:00:29,305 --> 00:00:31,893
and samurai swords in a
nanosecond if a bunch of

17
00:00:31,893 --> 00:00:33,861
Koreans moved in around here.

18
00:00:33,861 --> 00:00:35,621
- It's Japanese.

19
00:00:35,621 --> 00:00:37,485
- Well fuck it, I'll
sell sushi, too.

00:00:37,485 --> 00:00:39,936
[jazz music]

21
00:01:05,789 --> 00:01:08,482
But back to my point, Hammer
fucked up when he tried

22
00:01:08,482 --> 00:01:09,690
to go hard again.

23
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:13,107
Now let me digress, when
old Hammer went pop,

24
00:01:13,107 --> 00:01:16,076
he lost hardcore brothers
and got Teddy in the country

25
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:18,388
mall, but when Teddy
heard from the streets

26
00:01:18,388 --> 00:01:21,840
that Hammer was a sell-out,
Teddy stops listening.

27
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,807
It don't matter that Teddy
is the one that Hammer

28
00:01:23,807 --> 00:01:28,364
sold out to, because young
Theodore just wants to be down.

29
00:01:28,364 --> 00:01:31,125
So Hammer's now stuck
with supply but no demand

30
00:01:31,125 --> 00:01:34,508
from either constituency,
pop or hardcore.

- Do I have to give you a
drum roll to get to the point?

33
00:02:19,277 --> 00:02:22,176
- What I'm saying is
black folk in general

34
00:02:22,176 --> 00:02:25,006
wanna stay black, in
thought and spirit.

35
00:02:25,006 --> 00:02:27,561
And in the hood, if you're
gonna be hardcore down,

36
00:02:27,561 --> 00:02:28,976
you can not even smile.

37
00:02:28,976 --> 00:02:31,772
That shit's a capital offense
in the street by laws.

to do with my speech?

to

No.

It's a,

51
00:04:04,036 --> 00:04:06,176
for the school
where she teaches.

52
00:04:06,176 --> 00:04:08,731
She's not a counselor
there anymore.

No.

Algebra, I think.

57
00:04:15,185 --> 00:04:18,361
- Why does this have
to be a race speech?

58
00:04:18,361 --> 00:04:19,742
- I don't know, I think
Nicole wants to impress

59
00:04:19,742 --> 00:04:21,468
her principal, you know?

60
00:04:21,468 --> 00:04:22,779
- Isn't it career day?

61
00:04:22,779 --> 00:04:24,333
Aren't you supposed to
talk about your job?

62
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:26,507
That's what the guest speakers
did when I was in school.

63
00:04:26,507 --> 00:04:29,614
- But there's all
this sensitivity

diversity training in
schools and all that.

67
00:04:36,586 --> 00:04:38,278
- So the principal wants
some sort of sensitivity

68
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:39,279
seminar or something?

69
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,107
- Yeah, yeah.

70
00:04:40,107 --> 00:04:42,040
I guess so, I mean.

71
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:45,940
- What do you know
about sensitivity?

72
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:48,702
- You read the article on race
relations in the workplace

73
00:04:48,702 --> 00:04:50,738
I did for Essence Magazine?

74
00:04:50,738 --> 00:04:52,947
- Sorry, my
subscription ran out.

you might learn something.

76

make you an expert?

- Richard, you gonna help
me write this thing or not?

- Nah, girl, you can't
tell me he is that shallow.

80
00:05:13,278 --> 00:05:16,246
- He is, Labrega, I've
known him longer than you.

81
00:05:16,246 --> 00:05:18,283
- But didn't he go to
that Million Man March?

I saw him with the T shirt!

83

- Girl, that don't mean nothing.

84
00:05:20,665 --> 00:05:22,252
A brother can be as
Afro-centric as you want

85
00:05:22,252 --> 00:05:24,531
and still be
skeezing on the side.

86

Now he's having his
party at the house,

87
00:05:26,118 --> 00:05:27,361

So my brother's up there
with two of his boys,

folks coming in.

get up off the sofa

they can't beat Mike.

- Beat Mike?

put his Nike's in his locker.

- Oh, she's other.

101
00:05:51,696 --> 00:05:54,906
- Oh yeah, now they just
go up and leave the game.

- Oh, you got that good hair.

- We might not see eye to eye.

your help I figure,

my peace my friend.

- Come on, man.

00:06:19,862 --> 00:06:22,243

me here at 8:30.

- Nicole's coming here?

116
00:06:24,142 --> 00:06:26,800
- Yeah, she left something at
my apartment the other night.

117
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,871
- Does she know you
haven't written the speech?

118
00:06:28,871 --> 00:06:30,666
- No, and I would appreciate it

119
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:32,633
if you didn't mention anything.

I wasn't doing something

122
00:06:35,256 --> 00:06:36,879
I didn't have sex for a week.

- Yes, he did.

- No, he didn't.

- Yes, he did.

00:06:40,745 --> 00:06:42,263
Later on, I charged
him up about it, too.

00:06:42,263 --> 00:06:44,576

00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:54,448
But just so you know, I
think race is something that

135
00:06:54,448 --> 00:06:55,898
just doesn't get settled.

No, actually, I disagree.

00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:02,974
it'll be good in terms
of a speech, you know?

00:07:02,974 --> 00:07:05,217
I mean, the differences
in our thinking,

141

that's what's
gonna make it work.

talk about some topics?

- I don't feel guilty
about 200 years of slavery.

181
00:10:24,244 --> 00:10:25,625
- 400.

182
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,350
- I mean, it was
before I was born.

183
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:28,800
What?

184
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,114
- 400, it was 400
years of slavery.

185
00:10:32,114 --> 00:10:34,219
Jamestown, Virginia, 1609.

186
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:37,257
The first slaves
were brought there

187
00:10:37,257 --> 00:10:39,328
and they were slaves on
the long ass boat ride

188
00:10:39,328 --> 00:10:40,605
before they got there.

189
00:10:40,605 --> 00:10:41,433
400 years.

190
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,609
- At the turn of the century,

191
00:10:44,609 --> 00:10:46,473
W.E.B. DuBois

192
00:10:46,473 --> 00:10:48,544
said that the greatest
problem facing America

193
00:10:48,544 --> 00:10:52,030
was the question of the
color line, and it still is.

194
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:54,792
- What the fuck do you
know about W.E.B. DuBois?

195
00:10:54,792 --> 00:10:56,725
- I took a Black Studies
elective to get out of

196
00:10:56,725 --> 00:10:58,312
a statistics class.

197
00:10:59,935 --> 00:11:03,835
Help me get together with
Sharon Williams, too.

198
00:11:05,112 --> 00:11:07,218
- You got Sharon Williams?

199
00:11:16,572 --> 00:11:17,400
Bro.

200
00:11:20,127 --> 00:11:22,923
I tried to date her
for the longest time.

201
00:11:22,923 --> 00:11:24,269
- You were too nice.

202
00:11:24,269 --> 00:11:25,270
- What?

203
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:27,065
- You wouldn't make fun of her.

204
00:11:27,065 --> 00:11:28,895
- Oh yeah, yeah,
that woulda worked.

205
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:31,035
- I think you were in your
proud Afro-centric phase

206
00:11:31,035 --> 00:11:32,933
when you couldn't make
fun of your African Queen.

207
00:11:32,933 --> 00:11:33,831
- Slow down.

208
00:11:33,831 --> 00:11:35,073
Slow it down.

209
00:11:35,073 --> 00:11:37,351
- I'm telling you,
Sharon Williams

210
00:11:37,351 --> 00:11:39,181
was one of those rich
girls from Cherry Hill.

211
00:11:39,181 --> 00:11:41,735
She didn't see
color, she saw class.

212
00:11:41,735 --> 00:11:43,254
- What, I don't have class?

213
00:11:43,254 --> 00:11:44,531
- Not with her.

214
00:11:46,188 --> 00:11:48,121
I'm telling you.

215
00:11:48,121 --> 00:11:50,675
You don't get to those
girls by being nice, man.

216
00:11:50,675 --> 00:11:52,263
They grow up with
those prep school boys

217
00:11:52,263 --> 00:11:53,885
hanging on their every whim.

218
00:11:53,885 --> 00:11:56,301
- So did you do the old
wound and heal, is that?

219
00:11:56,301 --> 00:11:57,233
- Oh yeah.

220
00:11:57,233 --> 00:11:58,407
Cut them, praise.

221
00:11:58,407 --> 00:12:00,409
Miss a date, bring flowers.

222
00:12:00,409 --> 00:12:01,617
- How was she?

223
00:12:04,827 --> 00:12:06,829
- What, why are you
looking at me like that?

224
00:12:06,829 --> 00:12:09,038
With that, like,
look on your face?

225
00:12:09,038 --> 00:12:10,868
- I don't know.

226
00:12:10,868 --> 00:12:11,903
Alright.

227
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:13,733
Nothing special.

228
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:15,493
- You know, I was at the club,

229
00:12:15,493 --> 00:12:17,150
you know, PePe's place?

230
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:20,015
And I'm sitting in there with
my little Tanqueray and tonic

231
00:12:20,015 --> 00:12:21,602
like I like to do on occasion.

232
00:12:21,602 --> 00:12:23,397
Now back then, I wasn't
getting much play,

233
00:12:23,397 --> 00:12:24,882
my hair was about that short,

234
00:12:24,882 --> 00:12:26,538
and even though I was looking
cute, nobody was paying me

235
00:12:26,538 --> 00:12:27,505
no mind.

236
00:12:27,505 --> 00:12:29,472
So I get this idea,

237
00:12:29,472 --> 00:12:32,613
I'll go back to that
same club one week later,

238
00:12:32,613 --> 00:12:34,167
weave down to here.

239
00:12:34,167 --> 00:12:37,860
Let me tell you, they were
all in my business, girl.

240
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:40,104
Brothers just coming out
of the woodwork with drinks

241
00:12:40,104 --> 00:12:41,381
and everything.

242
00:12:41,381 --> 00:12:43,555
- See, they thinking,
ohh, she must be mixed,

243
00:12:43,555 --> 00:12:45,074
she ain't all black.

244
00:12:45,074 --> 00:12:48,215
- See, that's why I gotta
give props to Chico DeBarge.

245
00:12:48,215 --> 00:12:49,527
You see that new video he have?

246
00:12:49,527 --> 00:12:50,977
- No, is it on BET?

247
00:12:50,977 --> 00:12:53,013
- BET bought
something, anyway girl,

248
00:12:53,013 --> 00:12:55,878
he's got a regular brown
skinned sister as the star

249
00:12:55,878 --> 00:12:56,948
of that video.

250
00:12:56,948 --> 00:12:57,915
Mmhmm.

251
00:12:57,915 --> 00:12:59,088
You know we never see that.

252
00:12:59,088 --> 00:13:00,262
- You're not lying.

253
00:13:00,262 --> 00:13:01,435
- Tupac?

254
00:13:01,435 --> 00:13:03,092
Please.

255
00:13:03,092 --> 00:13:05,819
He's gonna tell black
people what to do?

256
00:13:05,819 --> 00:13:08,097
- He recites some history.

257
00:13:08,097 --> 00:13:10,651
- Oh please, all these gangster
rappers telling black people

258
00:13:10,651 --> 00:13:12,308
with college
educations what to do.

259
00:13:12,308 --> 00:13:14,690
That doesn't strike you as odd?

260
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:17,658
- Okay, so you're saying
that lower class blacks

261
00:13:17,658 --> 00:13:20,075
have the upper and
middle class in check?

262
00:13:20,075 --> 00:13:21,283
- You know it.

263
00:13:21,283 --> 00:13:22,905
You get called Uncle
Tom in a second

264
00:13:22,905 --> 00:13:26,081
if you went against the
kind of agenda they set.

265
00:13:26,081 --> 00:13:27,323
Right?

266
00:13:27,323 --> 00:13:28,773
I mean, I'm not saying be white,

267
00:13:28,773 --> 00:13:31,155
but this tough guy stuff
is not exactly your

268
00:13:31,155 --> 00:13:34,054
Stanley Kaplan
formula for success.

269
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:39,439
Imagine if white people were
dictated to by white trash?

270
00:13:39,439 --> 00:13:41,234
We'd all live in trailer
parks in West Virginia

271
00:13:41,234 --> 00:13:43,029
and be the most populous state.

272
00:13:43,029 --> 00:13:45,410
- These brothers are just hung
up on this European standard

273
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:46,722
of beauty.

274
00:13:46,722 --> 00:13:48,931
- And there's so few
black men as it is.

275
00:13:48,931 --> 00:13:51,796
- They either in jail, gay, or
else they're hung up on that

276
00:13:51,796 --> 00:13:54,109
light, bright, better
than white perception.

277
00:13:54,109 --> 00:13:54,937
- LSP.

278
00:13:56,456 --> 00:13:58,768
- Or they jump across the
track to a white girl.

279
00:13:58,768 --> 00:14:00,391
- Oh now, see, I don't
think that's LSP, though.

280
00:14:00,391 --> 00:14:02,186
I think that's 'cause
them white girls give up

281
00:14:02,186 --> 00:14:03,773
the orals right quick.

282
00:14:03,773 --> 00:14:05,327
- Now see, I know that's right.

283
00:14:05,327 --> 00:14:07,467
My room mate up at Rutger's,
she was always talking about

284
00:14:07,467 --> 00:14:08,813
that shit with her friends.

285
00:14:08,813 --> 00:14:11,712
They damn near think
they enjoy that mess.

286
00:14:11,712 --> 00:14:13,266
- Do you know what
I can't stand?

287
00:14:13,266 --> 00:14:15,233
Is when I see a brother with
a white chick and she ain't

288
00:14:15,233 --> 00:14:16,510
even that cute.

289
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:17,718
- Okay!

290
00:14:17,718 --> 00:14:19,237
- I mean they either
can't handle us

291
00:14:19,237 --> 00:14:21,688
or they just aint' interested
in loving nobody, right?

292
00:14:21,688 --> 00:14:23,207
They lost.

293
00:14:23,207 --> 00:14:25,554
I'm telling you, slavery is
still messing with people.

294
00:14:25,554 --> 00:14:26,624
- Oh, it ain't over.

295
00:14:26,624 --> 00:14:27,797
It ain't over.

296
00:14:27,797 --> 00:14:29,351
Drama ain't over for
the soldier just because

297
00:14:29,351 --> 00:14:30,628
the war is over.

298
00:14:30,628 --> 00:14:32,699
- You got that right.

299
00:14:32,699 --> 00:14:35,322
Ooh, girl, we got to go.

300
00:14:35,322 --> 00:14:38,463
- So, when's your
brother coming back?

301
00:14:38,463 --> 00:14:41,294
- Next week, I will tell him
you were talking about him.

302
00:14:41,294 --> 00:14:43,089
- No, don't say anything.

303
00:14:43,089 --> 00:14:45,194
- I know how to set people
up, I'll hook it up.

304
00:14:45,194 --> 00:14:46,057
- Alright.

305
00:14:46,057 --> 00:14:47,058
What do I owe?

306
00:14:47,058 --> 00:14:49,267
- Nothing, I can
put in for this.

307
00:14:49,267 --> 00:14:50,682
- I was hoping you'd say that.

308
00:14:50,682 --> 00:14:51,856
- Cheap.

309
00:14:51,856 --> 00:14:54,755
- Excuse me, I couldn't
help but overhear,

310
00:14:54,755 --> 00:14:55,895
what is L S P?

311
00:14:58,069 --> 00:14:59,760
- Light Skin Presumption.

312
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,177
You know, like when a
black woman dresses up with

313
00:15:02,177 --> 00:15:04,696
long, straight hair,
short, tight, skirt and.

314
00:15:04,696 --> 00:15:05,974
- Heels.

315
00:15:05,974 --> 00:15:08,700
- Yeah, like that,
like a white girl.

316
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:09,805
- Okay.

317
00:15:09,805 --> 00:15:10,944
Well thanks.

318
00:15:10,944 --> 00:15:12,014
- No problem.

319
00:15:20,471 --> 00:15:22,335
Hey, you on duty?

320
00:15:22,335 --> 00:15:25,027
- Sure, where ya headed?

321
00:15:25,027 --> 00:15:27,650
- Houston and Broadway.

322
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:28,651
- Hop on in.

323
00:15:36,694 --> 00:15:38,282
- What, 40 acres and a mule?

324
00:15:38,282 --> 00:15:40,698
- Yeah, knowing Spike Lee,
that's a black thing, right?

325
00:15:40,698 --> 00:15:41,975
- Leave Spike alone, man.

326
00:15:41,975 --> 00:15:42,942
- Oh, it's Spike to you?

327
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,012
- Yeah, Spike.

328
00:15:44,012 --> 00:15:45,806
Spike goddamn genius Lee.

329
00:15:45,806 --> 00:15:48,050
- Oh, Spike Lee is no genius.

330
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:49,534
- What, you're crazy.

331
00:15:49,534 --> 00:15:51,329
- His movies are like film
school level with that

332
00:15:51,329 --> 00:15:52,986
floating actor crap.

333
00:15:52,986 --> 00:15:54,954
I mean, they're not even
walking, what is that?

334
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,645
- Come, you ever notice
how black people always get

335
00:15:56,645 --> 00:15:57,818
criticized like that?

336
00:15:57,818 --> 00:15:59,372
- Ooh, you're not
getting away with that.

337
00:15:59,372 --> 00:16:00,890
- What?

338
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:02,064
- White people never get
to criticize anybody black.

339
00:16:02,064 --> 00:16:02,892
- Oh, really?

340
00:16:02,892 --> 00:16:03,721
You coulda fooled me.

341
00:16:03,721 --> 00:16:04,964
- It's so taboo to say

342
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,482
anything bad about
black people today.

343
00:16:06,482 --> 00:16:07,863
- Stop, stop it, just stop it.

344
00:16:07,863 --> 00:16:10,107
You wouldn't say
anything about, like that

345
00:16:10,107 --> 00:16:12,143
about Coppola,
Scorsese, De Palma,

346
00:16:12,143 --> 00:16:14,180
even a dude like
Cimino, you wouldn't?

347
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:15,733
- Oh, well, Deerhunter
was long as hell.

348
00:16:15,733 --> 00:16:17,700
Shoulda been called The
Unbearable Length of Film.

349
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:20,082
- Yeah, well you wouldn't
be so critical, I mean,

350
00:16:20,082 --> 00:16:21,394
you see Do The Right Thing?

351
00:16:21,394 --> 00:16:23,568
A great movie, lost
the Academy Award to

352
00:16:23,568 --> 00:16:25,846
Driving Miss Fucking Daisy.

353
00:16:25,846 --> 00:16:27,020
Huh?

354
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:28,539
That shows you the
mindset of the Academy.

355
00:16:28,539 --> 00:16:29,505
Subservient blacks.

356
00:16:29,505 --> 00:16:30,920
- Don't even go there.

357
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,163
- What?

358
00:16:32,163 --> 00:16:33,647
Fine, I'll let it
go, I'll let it go.

359
00:16:33,647 --> 00:16:35,580
But you gotta deal with the
black quarterback issue.

360
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:36,996
- That I will do.

361
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:40,516
[marching band music]

362
00:16:40,516 --> 00:16:42,587
- Why is that every
black quarterback
coming out of college

363
00:16:42,587 --> 00:16:44,900
is too short to
play in the pros?

364
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,315
- I don't know,
hormones perhaps?

365
00:16:46,315 --> 00:16:47,799
- Ha ha ha, right.

366
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:49,249
- Don't you think these
owners are business people?

367
00:16:49,249 --> 00:16:51,527
I would think that they
would want the best product

368
00:16:51,527 --> 00:16:54,013
out there, that's all the
players are to them anyway.

369
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,669
So why wouldn't
they let them play?

370
00:16:55,669 --> 00:16:56,912
- They wouldn't let them play.

371
00:16:56,912 --> 00:16:58,948
You ever hear of the
old boy network, hello?

372
00:16:58,948 --> 00:17:01,848
And, hell, most of the
season ticket holders, white.

373
00:17:01,848 --> 00:17:04,402
In fact, all those motherfuckers
all drunk up in the stands

374
00:17:04,402 --> 00:17:05,679
are white.

375
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:07,198
- White with jobs
to pay for tickets.

376
00:17:07,198 --> 00:17:09,787
- Yeah, well, hey,
that shit is documented

377
00:17:09,787 --> 00:17:11,306
is all I'm saying.

378
00:17:11,306 --> 00:17:13,101
Before the NBA learned how
to market Larry Bird and

379
00:17:13,101 --> 00:17:15,517
Magic Johnson's smile, white
people weren't going to the

380
00:17:15,517 --> 00:17:17,553
games because they couldn't
identify with the overly

381
00:17:17,553 --> 00:17:19,141
black product.

382
00:17:19,141 --> 00:17:22,041
Look that shit up, it's in
the newspapers in the 70s.

383
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,490
- The 70s?

384
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:25,906
This is the 90s, Michael
Jordan's jersey is probably on

385
00:17:25,906 --> 00:17:29,117
more white kids'
backs than black kids.

386
00:17:30,566 --> 00:17:32,120
I don't see any white kids
walking around wearing

387
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,776
Steve Kerr jerseys.

388
00:17:33,776 --> 00:17:35,192
- Well you just need
to recognize that
times haven't changed

389
00:17:35,192 --> 00:17:36,020
that much.

390
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:36,952
Steve Kerr?

391
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:39,886
Shit.

392
00:17:39,886 --> 00:17:41,853
- I mean, that's all you
ever saw in all them old

393
00:17:41,853 --> 00:17:43,372
black and white movies.

394
00:17:43,372 --> 00:17:44,925
- I know, you never see any
white cab drivers anymore.

395
00:17:44,925 --> 00:17:46,686
- Oh no, just people with
names you can't pronounce.

396
00:17:46,686 --> 00:17:48,377
- Girl, the other day

397
00:17:48,377 --> 00:17:50,345
I had this cab driver
with this name,

398
00:17:50,345 --> 00:17:51,484
it was something.

399
00:17:51,484 --> 00:17:53,279
Saddam Saddam Fuckman.

400
00:17:54,452 --> 00:17:56,316
- I had him too,
the other day, girl.

401
00:17:56,316 --> 00:17:58,215
It was a short Korean dude
with like 10 of them pine

402
00:17:58,215 --> 00:17:59,043
air conditioners.

403
00:17:59,043 --> 00:18:00,562
- Yes, that's him!

404
00:18:02,011 --> 00:18:03,910
- [Driver] I just hate it
when they don't speak English.

405
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:05,429
- That's right.

406
00:18:05,429 --> 00:18:08,363
- So tell me, what happened
to all the white cab drivers?

407
00:18:08,363 --> 00:18:10,710
- [Driver] Third floor of the
Museum of Natural History,

408
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:12,125
right next to the dinosaurs.

409
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:14,369
[laughing]

410
00:18:17,337 --> 00:18:19,132
- What does this mean?

411
00:18:22,618 --> 00:18:23,930
- I don't know.

412
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:27,554
Haven't been hanging
around the kids lately.

413
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,008
You know the higher and
higher I go in my career,

414
00:18:33,008 --> 00:18:34,734
the less and less
white guys I meet.

415
00:18:34,734 --> 00:18:35,597
- White guys?

416
00:18:35,597 --> 00:18:37,012
You mean blacks.

417
00:18:37,012 --> 00:18:38,496
- What'd I say?

418
00:18:38,496 --> 00:18:40,671
- You said white, you
meant black, right?

419
00:18:40,671 --> 00:18:42,569
- That upset you or something?

420
00:18:42,569 --> 00:18:43,708
- What?

421
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:45,814
- You were all indignant.

422
00:18:48,886 --> 00:18:50,784
- You mean like I can't
believe you said white guys,

423
00:18:50,784 --> 00:18:52,476
not black?

424
00:18:52,476 --> 00:18:53,960
- Yeah, like that.

425
00:18:55,651 --> 00:18:58,723
- I'm just saying you
said the wrong thing.

426
00:18:58,723 --> 00:19:00,139
- Yeah.

427
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:01,899
- You gotta admit, it
sounds a little weird.

428
00:19:01,899 --> 00:19:03,349
I mean there aren't
a lot of black people

429
00:19:03,349 --> 00:19:04,729
as you go up the
corporate ladder.

430
00:19:04,729 --> 00:19:07,249
That was what you meant, right?

431
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:09,458
- Yeah.

432
00:19:11,426 --> 00:19:14,118
- See, this is what I
was talking about before.

433
00:19:14,118 --> 00:19:16,914
White guys can't say
anything about black people.

434
00:19:16,914 --> 00:19:17,742
- Excuse me?

435
00:19:17,742 --> 00:19:18,812
- It's true.

436
00:19:18,812 --> 00:19:20,331
- True what?

437
00:19:20,331 --> 00:19:22,609
I wasn't the one getting
upset about it, you were.

438
00:19:22,609 --> 00:19:24,680
This is your shit.

439
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,855
- You were getting a
little sarcastic there.

440
00:19:26,855 --> 00:19:27,683
- Come on.

441
00:19:28,822 --> 00:19:30,307
- Alright, you
don't agree with me

442
00:19:30,307 --> 00:19:32,723
that a white, heterosexual
male can't catch a break?

443
00:19:32,723 --> 00:19:36,830
- Oh, poor baby, they say bad
words and hurt your feelings.

444
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:38,798
- I'm serious, if you're
white you don't get cut

445
00:19:38,798 --> 00:19:40,109
any slack.

446
00:19:40,109 --> 00:19:41,939
- Try getting lynched.

447
00:19:43,596 --> 00:19:45,218
Can we just move on?

448
00:19:48,704 --> 00:19:50,810
- You think you just
aced me, or something?

449
00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:52,329
- This is not about.

450
00:19:52,329 --> 00:19:53,537
- No, see I wasn't really
satisfied about what we said

451
00:19:53,537 --> 00:19:55,021
about this before.

452
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:58,335
- So what is it?

453
00:19:58,335 --> 00:20:01,130
Too many stand-ups making fun
of white guys for your taste?

454
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:05,204
- Oh, fuck you, you don't
understand what this is like.

455
00:20:06,653 --> 00:20:08,517
See, everything is geared

456
00:20:08,517 --> 00:20:11,175
toward making blacks
look like the good guys.

457
00:20:11,175 --> 00:20:14,799
Affirmative action,
the media, all that.

458
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:16,353
I think it may be
the greatest problem

459
00:20:16,353 --> 00:20:18,251
facing white people today.

460
00:20:18,251 --> 00:20:22,359
Is we're expected to feel
so guilty about everything.

461
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,326
It's bullshit.

462
00:20:24,326 --> 00:20:26,086
It's bullshit, it is.

463
00:20:27,156 --> 00:20:27,985
See,

464
00:20:29,366 --> 00:20:30,815
I don't think blacks
should be able to get away

465
00:20:30,815 --> 00:20:32,817
with hiding behind
the past anymore.

466
00:20:32,817 --> 00:20:35,924
I, for one, am not
gonna stand for it.

467
00:20:40,342 --> 00:20:42,724
- Must be white thing.

468
00:20:42,724 --> 00:20:44,760
Guess I don't understand.

469
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:48,488
- No, I don't think you do.

470
00:20:49,696 --> 00:20:50,973
- Why should you
like the black part?

471
00:20:50,973 --> 00:20:52,009
You don't know shit
about being black.

472
00:20:52,009 --> 00:20:53,700
- See, now that's ignorant.

473
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,219
- I'm ignorant?

474
00:20:55,219 --> 00:20:56,738
- Yeah, that's like
saying I can't understand

475
00:20:56,738 --> 00:20:58,395
what it's like to be

476
00:20:58,395 --> 00:21:00,086
a French woman.

477
00:21:00,086 --> 00:21:00,949
- Oh, you do?

478
00:21:00,949 --> 00:21:02,295
- Well I can read.

479
00:21:02,295 --> 00:21:03,331
- You don't bleed.

480
00:21:03,331 --> 00:21:04,987
- Fuck you.

481
00:21:04,987 --> 00:21:05,816
- Fuck you.

482
00:21:05,816 --> 00:21:07,058
- No, fuck you.

483
00:21:07,058 --> 00:21:10,372
This proprietary shit
is so outta line.

484
00:21:10,372 --> 00:21:12,236
The other day I'm standing
right next to you,

485
00:21:12,236 --> 00:21:14,273
and that friend of yours,
what's his face, Mustafa,

486
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:15,929
makes some reference
to white boys.

487
00:21:15,929 --> 00:21:17,517
And he knows I'm your friend.

488
00:21:17,517 --> 00:21:18,898
- How long you been
holding that back?

489
00:21:18,898 --> 00:21:20,486
- Since it happened.

490
00:21:20,486 --> 00:21:21,280
- Uh huh.

491
00:21:23,351 --> 00:21:25,456
- Don't pretend you
don't know what I mean.

492
00:21:25,456 --> 00:21:27,803
White boys is the equivalent
of saying niggers.

493
00:21:27,803 --> 00:21:29,046
- Step off.

494
00:21:29,046 --> 00:21:30,427
- It's like me
saying those niggers.

495
00:21:30,427 --> 00:21:31,428
- Hey.

496
00:21:31,428 --> 00:21:32,981
Just hold it with the N word.

497
00:21:32,981 --> 00:21:35,259
- It's like someone
saying those niggers

498
00:21:35,259 --> 00:21:37,537
while you're in my
presence and I say nothing,

499
00:21:37,537 --> 00:21:39,436
expecting you to just go
along with some unsaid thought

500
00:21:39,436 --> 00:21:42,162
like, I don't mean you,
you're one of the good ones.

501
00:21:42,162 --> 00:21:43,474
- Lemme explain to you.

502
00:21:43,474 --> 00:21:46,374
White boys is not the same,

503
00:21:46,374 --> 00:21:47,582
at all,

504
00:21:47,582 --> 00:21:49,342
as saying the N word.

505
00:21:49,342 --> 00:21:51,310
- The way he said it, it was.

506
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,829
You say boy in that context,
it has a negative meaning,

507
00:21:53,829 --> 00:21:55,417
just like it did
in slavery times.

508
00:21:55,417 --> 00:21:57,661
- Oh, so you mean that when
a black man says white boys

509
00:21:57,661 --> 00:21:59,179
is the same as when some

510
00:21:59,179 --> 00:22:02,562
big, fat Louisiana cracker
sheriff calls a black man boy?

511
00:22:02,562 --> 00:22:05,220
- Yup, it's like some kind of
boy reversal thing going on.

512
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:07,291
White people today can't
say boy in reference

513
00:22:07,291 --> 00:22:08,257
to black people.

514
00:22:08,257 --> 00:22:09,189
- Really?
- Yeah.

515
00:22:09,189 --> 00:22:10,432
- You should take a driving tour

516
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:11,571
through the historic
South, my friend.

517
00:22:11,571 --> 00:22:12,745
- Well, I think you're wrong.

518
00:22:12,745 --> 00:22:14,160
- Hey, well, I
think you're wrong.

519
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,369
- Can you back that
up with anything?

520
00:22:16,369 --> 00:22:17,370
- History?

521
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:18,509
- Revisionist history?

522
00:22:18,509 --> 00:22:20,028
- Fuck you, man.

523
00:22:20,028 --> 00:22:21,340
- No, fuck you, why do you
have to be such an asshole?

524
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,686
- Why do you have to
be such a white boy?

525
00:22:22,686 --> 00:22:23,549
- Fuck you.

526
00:22:23,549 --> 00:22:24,722
- Fuck you.

527
00:22:24,722 --> 00:22:26,897
[buzzing]

528
00:22:34,767 --> 00:22:35,595
- Hi, Nicole.

529
00:22:35,595 --> 00:22:37,252
- Hi.

530
00:22:37,252 --> 00:22:38,080
- Good morning.

531
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:38,909
- Morning.

532
00:22:41,843 --> 00:22:43,465
Everything okay?

533
00:22:43,465 --> 00:22:44,811
- Yeah, yeah, I'll
see you later.

534
00:22:44,811 --> 00:22:45,640
- Okay.

535
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,779
- Hey.

536
00:22:46,779 --> 00:22:47,607
- Hi.

537
00:22:55,719 --> 00:22:57,893
- Then they asked me to gimme
a getting married thing,

538
00:22:57,893 --> 00:22:59,343
you know, so I gave 'em my,

539
00:22:59,343 --> 00:23:00,931
my copy of Huckleberry Finn.

540
00:23:00,931 --> 00:23:02,484
- What?

541
00:23:02,484 --> 00:23:04,417
- Well that's what I
was reading at the time.

542
00:23:04,417 --> 00:23:05,245
- Shit.

543
00:23:06,592 --> 00:23:09,008
- Yeah, right, that's exactly
the way they looked at

544
00:23:09,008 --> 00:23:11,838
each other, like what
the fuck is this?

545
00:23:11,838 --> 00:23:14,807
But they don't say
anything, you know.

546
00:23:14,807 --> 00:23:16,947
I figure that was
their first time.

547
00:23:16,947 --> 00:23:19,639
Then on top of that, I give
'em my keys, too, I mean,

548
00:23:19,639 --> 00:23:22,055
goddamn, my parents were just
a few feet away in the house.

549
00:23:22,055 --> 00:23:23,505
- Wait, there were two of 'em?

550
00:23:23,505 --> 00:23:24,437
- Oh yeah.

551
00:23:24,437 --> 00:23:25,783
- Well what'd you do?

552
00:23:25,783 --> 00:23:27,544
- What'd I do?

553
00:23:27,544 --> 00:23:30,547
I watched them walk off
with my keys, my Huck Finn

554
00:23:30,547 --> 00:23:33,791
and my one dollar,
all that I had.

555
00:23:33,791 --> 00:23:36,518
And then about 15 minutes
later, I come bolting out of

556
00:23:36,518 --> 00:23:39,210
my house with a
baseball bat in my hand,

557
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:41,005
walking up and down
the park, you know,

558
00:23:41,005 --> 00:23:42,766
I'm wanting my piece.

559
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:45,700
I'm pissed, you know?

560
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:48,634
Like pissed off, they
got 50 cents a piece.

561
00:23:48,634 --> 00:23:52,016
And crazy, too, like the
bat's gonna do something

562
00:23:52,016 --> 00:23:54,018
if they show up
with a gun, right?

563
00:23:54,018 --> 00:23:56,124
- I bet you hated all black
people right at that moment,

564
00:23:56,124 --> 00:23:57,125
didn't you?

565
00:23:57,125 --> 00:23:59,403
- I didn't say they were black.

566
00:23:59,403 --> 00:24:00,266
- You didn't?

567
00:24:00,266 --> 00:24:01,716
- No.

568
00:24:01,716 --> 00:24:03,234
- Then what were they?

569
00:24:03,234 --> 00:24:05,133
- I don't know, they were
talking some kind of Spanish

570
00:24:05,133 --> 00:24:06,203
or something.

571
00:24:07,411 --> 00:24:09,620
- So you're not gonna
tell me what happened?

572
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:11,415
- Nicole, I told you, nothing.

573
00:24:11,415 --> 00:24:14,418
- You're right, you
told me nothing.

574
00:24:15,592 --> 00:24:17,179
Come on, you're being
exceptionally cranky

575
00:24:17,179 --> 00:24:18,940
for a morning person.

576
00:24:21,494 --> 00:24:23,945
- Here's your stuff.

577
00:24:23,945 --> 00:24:24,773
- Thanks.

578
00:24:29,606 --> 00:24:30,434
- Hey.

579
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,886
I can't believe this.

580
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,655
- Where you going?

581
00:24:44,655 --> 00:24:46,346
- Your job is to take me
where I wanna go, man,

582
00:24:46,346 --> 00:24:47,969
not ask me questions, okay?

583
00:24:47,969 --> 00:24:51,110
- Lunch time, no
gas, go home, bye.

584
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:52,076
- Hey!

585
00:24:52,076 --> 00:24:53,146
Damn bastard.

586
00:24:56,667 --> 00:24:58,876
- Can I get the cab now?

587
00:24:58,876 --> 00:25:00,119
- You shouldn't have to.

588
00:25:00,119 --> 00:25:01,810
- And babies
shouldn't die of SIDS,

589
00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:03,467
that's the way the world works.

590
00:25:03,467 --> 00:25:05,538
Black people, men especially
have a different reality

591
00:25:05,538 --> 00:25:07,713
in America and the sooner
the people understand that.

592
00:25:07,713 --> 00:25:09,266
- Oh, the people?

593
00:25:09,266 --> 00:25:12,959
What are you, Angela Davis
with a skin graft now?

594
00:25:12,959 --> 00:25:16,480
- I think that as soon as
African Americans accept

595
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,309
the screwed up nature
of things American,

596
00:25:18,309 --> 00:25:20,449
the sooner they can lose
the rage and move forward

597
00:25:20,449 --> 00:25:21,381
as a people.

598
00:25:21,381 --> 00:25:23,729
- Thank you, Doctor Freud.

599
00:25:23,729 --> 00:25:25,420
- Don't dismiss me, Michael.

600
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:29,044
I'm not some white,
Liberal woman with a cause.

601
00:25:29,044 --> 00:25:31,150
Okay, I'm a white, Liberal
woman with a cause,

602
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:32,979
but I've also got a point.

603
00:25:32,979 --> 00:25:34,912
Every people on this
planet has been captured by

604
00:25:34,912 --> 00:25:36,742
another at some point.

605
00:25:36,742 --> 00:25:40,469
The Hapsburgs, Grecians,
Spanish, Egyptians, Chinese,

606
00:25:40,469 --> 00:25:43,542
Aztec, Incas, Ottomans,
Muskove, the Celtics,

607
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:47,097
my early ancestors, the Vikings,
barbarians that they were.

608
00:25:47,097 --> 00:25:49,513
- Look, Nicole, all I'm
saying is that turning the

609
00:25:49,513 --> 00:25:51,239
other cheek mentality doesn't.

610
00:25:51,239 --> 00:25:52,412
- Michael, that's not
what I'm getting at.

611
00:25:52,412 --> 00:25:53,931
- No, listen Bernard
Shaw once said,

612
00:25:53,931 --> 00:25:56,071
"The rational man adapts
himself to the world

613
00:25:56,071 --> 00:25:59,040
"and the irrational man
adapts the world to himself.

614
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,973
"Therefore all
progress is contingent

615
00:26:00,973 --> 00:26:02,940
"on the irrational man."

616
00:26:04,148 --> 00:26:06,668
- The Desert Storm
announcer said that?

617
00:26:06,668 --> 00:26:07,635
- No, the,

618
00:26:07,635 --> 00:26:09,326
the playwright.

619
00:26:09,326 --> 00:26:10,879
- Y'all need a cab?

620
00:26:12,087 --> 00:26:13,572
- You know, it's in your
best interest to tell me

621
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:16,713
what you and Richard
were arguing about.

622
00:26:16,713 --> 00:26:17,541
- Hmm?

623
00:26:18,991 --> 00:26:21,476
- If you do, I won't get
passive aggressive on you.

624
00:26:21,476 --> 00:26:24,341
Otherwise, six months from now,
you'll be watching some game

625
00:26:24,341 --> 00:26:26,170
and I'll pick a fight with
you about how you fold your

626
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:28,725
towels or something and
make you miss your game.

627
00:26:28,725 --> 00:26:31,382
Or at least lessen
you viewing pleasure.

628
00:26:31,382 --> 00:26:35,524
- One less day of therapy a
week might not be a bad idea.

629
00:26:38,493 --> 00:26:39,321
Okay.

630
00:26:42,635 --> 00:26:44,119
I haven't written
the speech yet.

631
00:26:44,119 --> 00:26:45,224
Richard was.

632
00:26:45,224 --> 00:26:46,018
- Michael.

633
00:26:49,711 --> 00:26:54,440
Okay, I'm not gonna get angry,
you were honest with me.

634
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,028
Go ahead.

635
00:26:56,028 --> 00:26:57,857
- He was helping me out.

636
00:26:57,857 --> 00:26:59,652
- I can't believe you.

637
00:27:02,759 --> 00:27:03,587
Anyway.

638
00:27:04,899 --> 00:27:07,211
What were you two?

639
00:27:07,211 --> 00:27:08,937
- We got into it.

640
00:27:08,937 --> 00:27:12,561
He thought white boys
is the same as saying

641
00:27:12,561 --> 00:27:14,184
the N word.

642
00:27:14,184 --> 00:27:15,012
- Nigger?

643
00:27:17,083 --> 00:27:17,912
Richard?

644
00:27:17,912 --> 00:27:19,292
- Yeah.

645
00:27:19,292 --> 00:27:20,086
- Why?

646
00:27:21,536 --> 00:27:23,814
- He just wanted to write
the black part of the speech.

647
00:27:23,814 --> 00:27:24,643
- Boys.

648
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:26,541
- What boys?

649
00:27:27,715 --> 00:27:29,061
This is not one of your little.

650
00:27:29,061 --> 00:27:31,719
- It's okay, take it easy, baby.

651
00:27:31,719 --> 00:27:33,099
- Don't trivialize this, Nicole.

652
00:27:33,099 --> 00:27:34,066
- You know.

653
00:27:34,066 --> 00:27:35,308
- This is a big thing I'm just.

654
00:27:35,308 --> 00:27:36,516
- He didn't mean anything.

655
00:27:36,516 --> 00:27:38,104
- Right, well he said that I.

656
00:27:38,104 --> 00:27:40,866
- A child calls a friend
fat and stupid because

657
00:27:40,866 --> 00:27:41,936
he won't share any,

658
00:27:41,936 --> 00:27:43,351
any of his ice cream.

659
00:27:43,351 --> 00:27:46,043
Why, because fat and
stupid are better cut downs

660
00:27:46,043 --> 00:27:47,631
than selfish.

661
00:27:47,631 --> 00:27:49,391
Greedy is pretty good,
but not as cutting,

662
00:27:49,391 --> 00:27:52,394
so he reaches for fat and
stupid because it's the quickest

663
00:27:52,394 --> 00:27:53,844
and the sharpest.

664
00:27:53,844 --> 00:27:55,846
- Child had to be thinking
fat and stupid before.

665
00:27:55,846 --> 00:27:58,642
- No, not necessarily, before
they went to get ice cream,

666
00:27:58,642 --> 00:28:00,230
that child might have
been thinking this guy

667
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:01,783
is the greatest guy
in the whole world.

668
00:28:01,783 --> 00:28:03,612
The phrase fat and stupid
may have never entered

669
00:28:03,612 --> 00:28:05,028
that child's mind before.

670
00:28:05,028 --> 00:28:06,408
- This is stupid.

671
00:28:07,375 --> 00:28:08,652
- Fat and stupid?

672
00:28:08,652 --> 00:28:09,480
- Stop it.

673
00:28:11,482 --> 00:28:14,244
I can't believe
you're defending him.

674
00:28:14,244 --> 00:28:16,211
- Richard is your friend.

675
00:28:16,211 --> 00:28:17,626
You've known each other
since high school,

676
00:28:17,626 --> 00:28:18,938
for crying out loud.

677
00:28:18,938 --> 00:28:20,871
- Race is a serious thing.

678
00:28:20,871 --> 00:28:23,011
- Only when you let it be.

679
00:28:24,979 --> 00:28:26,705
- Can't believe this.

680
00:28:28,085 --> 00:28:29,777
- I've heard lots
of African Americans

681
00:28:29,777 --> 00:28:30,985
call each other nigger.

682
00:28:30,985 --> 00:28:32,503
- Yeah, well that's different.

683
00:28:32,503 --> 00:28:33,332
It's wrong.

684
00:28:33,332 --> 00:28:35,403
- Why is that wrong?

685
00:28:35,403 --> 00:28:38,337
You know, Frank Sinatra and
Dean Martin used to call each

686
00:28:38,337 --> 00:28:40,063
other that other
dago all the time.

687
00:28:40,063 --> 00:28:41,478
And you know how
close they were.

688
00:28:41,478 --> 00:28:42,997
- But oppressed
races don't do that.

689
00:28:42,997 --> 00:28:44,861
You don't hear
Woody Allen calling

690
00:28:44,861 --> 00:28:47,070
Mel Brooks that other kike.

691
00:28:55,181 --> 00:28:56,010
- Okay.

692
00:28:57,701 --> 00:28:59,254
Just have your speech ready by.

693
00:28:59,254 --> 00:29:00,600
- I'll be ready.

694
00:29:01,463 --> 00:29:02,292
- I know.

695
00:29:03,845 --> 00:29:05,674
You're a great writer.

696
00:29:07,262 --> 00:29:08,816
- Saying that to a writer
is better than saying

697
00:29:08,816 --> 00:29:10,438
you're a great lover.

698
00:29:10,438 --> 00:29:11,266
- I know.

699
00:29:11,266 --> 00:29:12,095
- Yeah.

700
00:29:17,065 --> 00:29:19,171
- So you'll be there at 2:30?

701
00:29:19,171 --> 00:29:20,689
- 1:45.

702
00:29:20,689 --> 00:29:23,209
- Just come running up
the aisle by three, okay?

703
00:29:23,209 --> 00:29:25,764
The principal's gonna be there.

704
00:29:27,351 --> 00:29:29,112
- Hey, you know something.

705
00:29:29,112 --> 00:29:31,010
You two would have some
beautiful looking kids,

706
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:32,149
you know that?

707
00:29:34,565 --> 00:29:37,672
- I think I'll
get out here, too.

708
00:29:37,672 --> 00:29:39,985
Go to Barnes and Noble's

something nice to them,

00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:44,089
maybe as

889
00:37:45,332 --> 00:37:48,749
Miss Thompson, the
math teacher, you can.

890
00:37:50,302 --> 00:37:54,237
- Right now, I'm talking
to you as a counselor.

891
00:37:55,618 --> 00:37:57,378
- But you know
what I've noticed?

892
00:37:57,378 --> 00:38:00,070
White men, they fantasize

893
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:02,901
on this downward
attraction thing,

894
00:38:02,901 --> 00:38:04,523
you know what I'm saying?

895
00:38:04,523 --> 00:38:08,493
They're attracted to what
is considered dirtier,

896
00:38:09,666 --> 00:38:11,012
dark and exotic.

897
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:13,083
And black men,

898
00:38:14,878 --> 00:38:17,398
in their minds, they aspire up.

899
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:21,747
You know, they
attracted to things like

900
00:38:21,747 --> 00:38:25,889
quote unquote the pure, the
white, the clean and ritzier.

901
00:38:27,097 --> 00:38:30,031
- Now that sounds pretty
stereotypical to me.

902
00:38:30,031 --> 00:38:32,586
- It's all generalizations,
William, but there is some

903
00:38:32,586 --> 00:38:33,794
truth in there.

904
00:38:38,523 --> 00:38:42,665
- So you don't think that
black men have bigger dicks?

905
00:38:45,530 --> 00:38:47,566
- Not unless you've
been with more black men

906
00:38:47,566 --> 00:38:48,533
than I have.

907
00:38:51,087 --> 00:38:53,123
Oh, William, you
play too, come on.

908
00:38:53,123 --> 00:38:53,952
- Nooo.

909
00:38:55,850 --> 00:38:58,922
Highschool, showering
after practice.

910
00:38:58,922 --> 00:39:01,028
The football team, please.

911
00:39:01,028 --> 00:39:02,443
- I was about to say.

912
00:39:02,443 --> 00:39:05,239
- I'm the last of the
Mohicans, you know that?

913
00:39:05,239 --> 00:39:07,379
- You got any class
reunions coming up?

914
00:39:07,379 --> 00:39:09,277
- I ain't inviting you.

915
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:16,181
- But you know what
it is, William?

916
00:39:16,181 --> 00:39:19,460
When a black man used to
get his thing together,

917
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:21,428
would start making
a lot of money,

918
00:39:21,428 --> 00:39:23,740
the first thing that
he would do was go out

919
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:26,916
and date a white woman,
'cause it was a status thing,

920
00:39:26,916 --> 00:39:28,193
ya know?

921
00:39:28,193 --> 00:39:31,058
And nowadays, I see
those same white women

922
00:39:31,058 --> 00:39:32,922
paying for the brothers.

923
00:39:32,922 --> 00:39:36,443
You got Leon, the
muffler repair man eating

924
00:39:37,858 --> 00:39:41,586
sushi a la carte with
Megan, the dairy queen from

925
00:39:41,586 --> 00:39:43,760
Pennsylvania
picking up the bill.

926
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,866
- Yeah, I seen that, too.

927
00:39:45,866 --> 00:39:48,316
You know Megan is just
rebelling against her parents

928
00:39:48,316 --> 00:39:51,216
because of some bullshit
hypocrisy the fed her,

929
00:39:51,216 --> 00:39:54,219
because they couldn't put her
in a better station in life.

930
00:39:54,219 --> 00:39:57,256
- And you know Megan's
parents told her to stay away

931
00:39:57,256 --> 00:39:59,431
from the taboo black man.

932
00:39:59,431 --> 00:40:01,191
- That's the wrong
thing to tell Megan.

933
00:40:01,191 --> 00:40:03,331
- Oh, Megan don't
wanna hear that.

934
00:40:03,331 --> 00:40:07,163
- So, it's reasons like that
that make you disapprove?

935
00:40:07,163 --> 00:40:09,614
- I didn't say I disapprove,
it's just not for me.

936
00:40:09,614 --> 00:40:12,789
Maybe for other people,
but it's not for me.

937
00:40:12,789 --> 00:40:15,482
I'll tell you what I do
think is weird, though.

938
00:40:15,482 --> 00:40:19,313
When people don't date
their own kind at all,

939
00:40:19,313 --> 00:40:21,246
now that shit is weird.

940
00:40:21,246 --> 00:40:23,144
That's some self hate.

941
00:40:23,144 --> 00:40:26,665
- Well you know, maybe, maybe
it's just some kind of fetish.

942
00:40:26,665 --> 00:40:28,460
I mean, maybe, you know,
there's people that just go

943
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:29,288
for parts.

944
00:40:32,499 --> 00:40:36,088
Yeah, you know what
I mean by parts is

945
00:40:36,088 --> 00:40:38,436
hair color, shoulders, legs,

946
00:40:41,059 --> 00:40:41,887
hands.

947
00:40:42,819 --> 00:40:44,027
- Skin is different.

948
00:40:44,027 --> 00:40:45,926
- Skin is not different.

949
00:40:45,926 --> 00:40:47,203
- It is so.

950
00:40:47,203 --> 00:40:48,411
- Skin is an external
thing that people.

951
00:40:48,411 --> 00:40:49,964
- Oh, come on.

952
00:40:49,964 --> 00:40:53,416
Skin has different, it has
a deeper meaning than that.

953
00:40:58,801 --> 00:41:02,287
Well, I think I better
get back to my job.

954
00:41:04,427 --> 00:41:06,429
- Yeah, I gotta go, too.

955
00:41:08,604 --> 00:41:09,674
I got a date.

956
00:41:12,504 --> 00:41:14,057
With a white woman.

957
00:41:16,853 --> 00:41:17,682
Whoa.

958
00:41:21,513 --> 00:41:24,171
[hip hop music]

959
00:42:42,594 --> 00:42:43,802
- Curtain's closed.

960
00:42:43,802 --> 00:42:45,942
- Damn, we missed her, yo.

961
00:42:55,607 --> 00:42:58,403
- And then there are other
blacks who are so angry

962
00:42:58,403 --> 00:43:00,888
that they don't ever even
deal with Affirmative Action.

963
00:43:00,888 --> 00:43:03,477
They know that they can just
work at McDonald's forever

964
00:43:03,477 --> 00:43:05,030
and never get anywhere.

965
00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:06,860
So they just wanna grab a
shotgun and strike out at

966
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:08,896
the first white guy who doesn't
have something good to say

967
00:43:08,896 --> 00:43:11,865
about Mary and Barry's wardrobe.

968
00:43:11,865 --> 00:43:14,695
- What do you think about it?

969
00:43:14,695 --> 00:43:17,491
- Ta-shi-kis are okay, I
wore one on a kibbutz once

970
00:43:17,491 --> 00:43:18,699
when I was dating this.

971
00:43:18,699 --> 00:43:20,080
- No, no, no, I mean
what do you think about

972
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:21,599
Affirmative Action?

973
00:43:22,979 --> 00:43:23,911
- Oh, well,

974
00:43:25,050 --> 00:43:26,604
some applications bother me.

975
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:27,984
Like it's the last
chance in the world

976
00:43:27,984 --> 00:43:30,193
that I'll ever get
something for free.

977
00:43:30,193 --> 00:43:33,093
I mean there are support
groups for Latins, blacks,

978
00:43:33,093 --> 00:43:35,820
gays, women, everybody.

979
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:38,443
Nothing for good old
fashioned white guys.

980
00:43:38,443 --> 00:43:40,928
- I think it's called
the Republican Party.

981
00:43:40,928 --> 00:43:42,654
- See, just because the
masters of the universe

982
00:43:42,654 --> 00:43:44,760
are members of my group,
I'm thought of as someone

983
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:46,347
who doesn't warrant assistance.

984
00:43:46,347 --> 00:43:49,109
- Don't you think
that warranting
assistance is just part

985
00:43:49,109 --> 00:43:51,111
of the American way?

986
00:43:51,111 --> 00:43:53,113
Take the special interests
groups that help get

987
00:43:53,113 --> 00:43:55,978
presidents elected,
or the tax code,

988
00:43:55,978 --> 00:43:58,256
capital gains, home interest.

989
00:43:58,256 --> 00:44:01,397
You are getting assistance,
because it's not a God-given

990
00:44:01,397 --> 00:44:04,296
right to deduct
interest on your homes.

991
00:44:04,296 --> 00:44:06,333
- You know, we like to think
that we're the land of the free

992
00:44:06,333 --> 00:44:08,991
and the home of the brave,

993
00:44:08,991 --> 00:44:10,509
but that's not true.

994
00:44:10,509 --> 00:44:13,202
Really, we're the land of the
chicken shit motherfuckers.

995
00:44:13,202 --> 00:44:15,238
You know, we like to say
on the face of it how

996
00:44:15,238 --> 00:44:18,621
pro-equal opportunity
we are, but we're not.

997
00:44:18,621 --> 00:44:21,141
And God help us if we
could admit the truth.

998
00:44:21,141 --> 00:44:24,420
- Those guys in Congress,
that put that stuff together?

999
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:26,042
They're going home and
they're fucking their wives

1000
00:44:26,042 --> 00:44:27,872
just a little bit better
'cause they think they done

1001
00:44:27,872 --> 00:44:29,736
something good for the world.

1002
00:44:29,736 --> 00:44:31,565
- Throw corporations
in there, too.

1003
00:44:31,565 --> 00:44:32,808
They support

1004
00:44:32,808 --> 00:44:36,535
some basketball player
or some rapper idiot

1005
00:44:36,535 --> 00:44:39,711
who sings all I need
is a nine and a bitch.

1006
00:44:39,711 --> 00:44:40,919
What the heck is that?

1007
00:44:40,919 --> 00:44:42,645
A nine and a bitch?

1008
00:44:42,645 --> 00:44:44,198
Yeah, that's insane that
they're rolled out there

1009
00:44:44,198 --> 00:44:45,579
as role models.

1010
00:44:45,579 --> 00:44:47,581
If corporate
sponsors had a clue,

1011
00:44:47,581 --> 00:44:49,963
there would not be 13 per
cent of the population

1012
00:44:49,963 --> 00:44:52,620
buying 60 per cent
of the sneakers.

1013
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:54,761
- No, see, I disagree.

1014
00:44:54,761 --> 00:44:56,038
And you know why

1015
00:44:56,038 --> 00:44:57,625
you don't know what
nine and a bitch is?

1016
00:44:57,625 --> 00:44:59,869
'Cause you ain't never
lived in a ghetto.

1017
00:44:59,869 --> 00:45:02,009
I think the rappers are
the best thing that could

1018
00:45:02,009 --> 00:45:05,047
possibly have happened
for African Americans.

1019
00:45:05,047 --> 00:45:06,531
They have set us free, okay?

1020
00:45:06,531 --> 00:45:07,774
You know why?

1021
00:45:07,774 --> 00:45:10,052
'Cause they don't give
a fuck what white people

1022
00:45:10,052 --> 00:45:11,294
think about 'em.

1023
00:45:11,294 --> 00:45:13,331
They don't wanna be
white, act white,

1024
00:45:13,331 --> 00:45:14,781
they don't want white women,

1025
00:45:14,781 --> 00:45:16,403
they are young, black warriors,

1026
00:45:16,403 --> 00:45:18,232
they will die for
what they believe in.

1027
00:45:18,232 --> 00:45:19,578
I think it's refreshing.

1028
00:45:19,578 --> 00:45:20,925
And that's why you
don't like 'em.

1029
00:45:20,925 --> 00:45:22,581
'Cause you're scared
of 'em, basically,

1030
00:45:22,581 --> 00:45:24,376
'cause they're
not scared of you.

1031
00:45:24,376 --> 00:45:27,207
- Look, there was a
time in this great city

1032
00:45:27,207 --> 00:45:28,656
where there was a schism.

1033
00:45:28,656 --> 00:45:29,761
- A schism?

1034
00:45:29,761 --> 00:45:31,452
- A schism.

1035
00:45:31,452 --> 00:45:33,489
Unique to Brooklyn and Queens.

1036
00:45:33,489 --> 00:45:37,596
It was the phenomenon of rock
sucks versus disco sucks.

1037
00:45:37,596 --> 00:45:39,771
Now everybody who was
black, except for like the

1038
00:45:39,771 --> 00:45:42,015
taped up Elvis Costello
glasses brothers in the

1039
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:44,465
chess club felt that rock sucks.

1040
00:45:44,465 --> 00:45:46,951
And on the other side, the
white boys, now I don't mean

1041
00:45:46,951 --> 00:45:49,298
white boys as a
derogatory phrase,

1042
00:45:49,298 --> 00:45:52,577
I mean boys of non-color,
who for the most part,

1043
00:45:52,577 --> 00:45:54,303
felt disco sucks.

1044
00:45:54,303 --> 00:45:56,236
See, a lot of
girls like to dance

1045
00:45:56,236 --> 00:45:58,825
and you can't hustle to
no Jethro Tull and shit.

1046
00:45:58,825 --> 00:46:01,206
I mean the rhythm
just don't work.

1047
00:46:01,206 --> 00:46:04,796
And the phenomenon here is
that the white boys started it.

1048
00:46:04,796 --> 00:46:06,556
- You were there
when it started?

1049
00:46:06,556 --> 00:46:08,317
- Like Crispicus Attucks,

1050
00:46:08,317 --> 00:46:12,873
the first man, a black man, to
die in the Revolutionary War.

1051
00:46:12,873 --> 00:46:14,357
Ironic shit, huh?

1052
00:46:14,357 --> 00:46:16,014
I mean, they kidnapped
the motherfucker,

1053
00:46:16,014 --> 00:46:17,775
bring him over on
some slave ship,

1054
00:46:17,775 --> 00:46:21,330
give him a fucked up
name like Crispicus

1055
00:46:21,330 --> 00:46:23,366
and he gotta be the first
motherfucker to die.

1056
00:46:23,366 --> 00:46:24,333
But I digress.

1057
00:46:24,333 --> 00:46:25,852
- Yes, you do.

1058
00:46:25,852 --> 00:46:28,061
- What I'm saying is that
the white boys made a comment

1059
00:46:28,061 --> 00:46:29,787
about disco, you know?

1060
00:46:29,787 --> 00:46:31,236
I mean they probably
didn't even mean the shit

1061
00:46:31,236 --> 00:46:33,135
as a personal front, 'cause
a lot of motherfuckers

1062
00:46:33,135 --> 00:46:35,102
hated disco back in the day.

1063
00:46:35,102 --> 00:46:37,346
I mean, I bet Don Cornelius
wanted that shit with

1064
00:46:37,346 --> 00:46:39,141
Soul Train-worthy for awhile.

1065
00:46:39,141 --> 00:46:42,558
But shoot, get down on
the subtext of this shit.

1066
00:46:42,558 --> 00:46:44,871
Now here's an oppressed
people who are, what,

1067
00:46:44,871 --> 00:46:47,908
ten years off the Civil Rights
struggle getting cut down

1068
00:46:47,908 --> 00:46:50,255
by their recent oppressors
in regards to their taste

1069
00:46:50,255 --> 00:46:51,222
in music.

1070
00:46:51,222 --> 00:46:52,671
Now how that's gonna go over?

1071
00:46:52,671 --> 00:46:55,433
A white boy breaking
on a brother's music.

1072
00:46:55,433 --> 00:46:57,884
- Peaches and Herbs shoulda
been off limits, huh.

1073
00:46:57,884 --> 00:47:00,231
- The one thing they
acknowledged over all those

1074
00:47:00,231 --> 00:47:02,854
slave years was taste in music.

1075
00:47:02,854 --> 00:47:05,615
Then suddenly they're
saying it sucks.

1076
00:47:05,615 --> 00:47:08,687
Like Stevie Winwood is the
motherfucking Amadeus and shit.

1077
00:47:08,687 --> 00:47:12,726
Of course, black folks gonna
get mad and say rock sucks

1078
00:47:12,726 --> 00:47:14,383
in righteous retribution.

1079
00:47:14,383 --> 00:47:16,212
- I'm running out of time here.

1080
00:47:16,212 --> 00:47:17,696
- Ken, you ever see
those Star Trek movies

1081
00:47:17,696 --> 00:47:19,250
where they fly around the sun?

1082
00:47:19,250 --> 00:47:20,872
- They did that in
three and five, right?

1083
00:47:20,872 --> 00:47:22,391
- Four, too, I think.

1084
00:47:22,391 --> 00:47:24,324
- Yeah that's when they
search for Spock's brain?

1085
00:47:24,324 --> 00:47:25,532
- I can't remember.

1086
00:47:25,532 --> 00:47:26,360
Yo, Vince?

1087
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:27,534
- I ain't no Trekkie.

1088
00:47:27,534 --> 00:47:28,742
- It's Trekker.

1089
00:47:28,742 --> 00:47:30,640
- Trekker, tractor,
whatever, Solo.

1090
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:32,435
- It's Sulu, man.

1091
00:47:32,435 --> 00:47:33,954
- I think the best
one was two, though.

1092
00:47:33,954 --> 00:47:35,300
- Oh yeah, the
General Khan ending?

1093
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:36,750
- Yeah, Kirk.

1094
00:47:36,750 --> 00:47:38,510
I will get you, Kirk.

1095
00:47:39,822 --> 00:47:43,101
Vengeance is a dish
best served cold,

1096
00:47:43,101 --> 00:47:45,414
and it's very cold in space,

1097
00:47:46,449 --> 00:47:47,278
Kirk.

1098
00:47:48,279 --> 00:47:49,487
- Yeah, that was dope.

1099
00:47:49,487 --> 00:47:51,144
- Vince, I thought
you weren't a Trekker?

1100
00:47:51,144 --> 00:47:53,042
- No, I just like that cat
who played the villain.

1101
00:47:53,042 --> 00:47:54,526
You know the guy
I'm talking about,

1102
00:47:54,526 --> 00:47:56,770
he was best friends with
the midget on The Loveboat.

1103
00:47:56,770 --> 00:47:58,358
He was the fucking man.

1104
00:47:58,358 --> 00:48:00,808
- Nah, dude, that's
Fantasy Island, man.

1105
00:48:00,808 --> 00:48:02,741
- What the fuck
is Fantasy Island?

1106
00:48:02,741 --> 00:48:03,915
- Oh, man.

1107
00:48:03,915 --> 00:48:05,296
- You don't remember?

1108
00:48:05,296 --> 00:48:07,505
The midget, the
plane, the plane.

1109
00:48:07,505 --> 00:48:10,439
If it was The Loveboat, it
would be the boat, the boat.

1110
00:48:10,439 --> 00:48:11,923
Yo, what's wrong with you?

1111
00:48:11,923 --> 00:48:14,132
- Damn, I thought they
were the same show.

1112
00:48:14,132 --> 00:48:16,065
I thought the boat was
parked by the island.

1113
00:48:16,065 --> 00:48:19,034
- Yo, anyway, you seen the
one when they fight The Borg?

1114
00:48:19,034 --> 00:48:20,898
- Nah, dude, that's
the new cast.

1115
00:48:20,898 --> 00:48:23,003
I'm saying in one of them,
they fly around the sun

1116
00:48:23,003 --> 00:48:24,004
and go back in time.

1117
00:48:24,004 --> 00:48:24,936
- Yeah, right, right, right.

1118
00:48:24,936 --> 00:48:26,489
- Yo, man, that shit is so cool.

1119
00:48:26,489 --> 00:48:28,388
I mean I'd go back to
like, old west days.

1120
00:48:28,388 --> 00:48:31,805
Shoot my six guns,
chew some beef jerky,

1121
00:48:31,805 --> 00:48:33,289
roll with my sidekicks.

1122
00:48:33,289 --> 00:48:34,773
- Yeah, sure, you can have that.

1123
00:48:34,773 --> 00:48:36,051
- Aw, come on, Ken,
you wouldn't wanna have

1124
00:48:36,051 --> 00:48:37,259
a bar room brawl?

1125
00:48:37,259 --> 00:48:38,053
- Man do you ever
hear of black people

1126
00:48:38,053 --> 00:48:39,295
wanna go back in time?

1127
00:48:39,295 --> 00:48:40,607
Man, if I went back, I'd
introduce those racist

1128
00:48:40,607 --> 00:48:42,298
motherfuckers to some
modern technology.

1129
00:48:42,298 --> 00:48:43,575
- Word.

1130
00:48:43,575 --> 00:48:45,405
- See here, boy, maybe
you better get them

1131
00:48:45,405 --> 00:48:47,545
city slicker clothes off
and get out in that field

1132
00:48:47,545 --> 00:48:49,236
and pick my cotton.

1133
00:48:49,236 --> 00:48:50,065
- Hmm.

1134
00:48:51,756 --> 00:48:55,622
You know, I think I'm
taking the day off, boss.

1135
00:48:59,212 --> 00:49:00,730
What do you think?

1136
00:49:00,730 --> 00:49:03,181
- Oh, I think you
oughta have a day off.

1137
00:49:03,181 --> 00:49:04,665
- Oh.

1138
00:49:04,665 --> 00:49:07,047
Shit, you know how they do
on those fake history things,

1139
00:49:07,047 --> 00:49:08,290
when they be like,

1140
00:49:08,290 --> 00:49:09,912
well what if the Nazis
got the bomb first?

1141
00:49:09,912 --> 00:49:11,396
I'd be like what if
Chicken George had a tank

1142
00:49:11,396 --> 00:49:14,572
and all the ammo he needed
to kick some cracker ass?

1143
00:49:14,572 --> 00:49:16,712
- Maybe I can interest you
in another time period?

1144
00:49:16,712 --> 00:49:18,714
- Yo, ancient Egypt is about
the only time I can think of

1145
00:49:18,714 --> 00:49:20,543
when black people
weren't getting mugged.

1146
00:49:20,543 --> 00:49:22,511
- Egyptians were black?

1147
00:49:22,511 --> 00:49:23,374
- Just because?

1148
00:49:23,374 --> 00:49:24,547
- They're not now.

1149
00:49:24,547 --> 00:49:26,239
- Then what are they?

1150
00:49:26,239 --> 00:49:27,240
- Arabs?

1151
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:28,896
- Dark skinned people.

1152
00:49:28,896 --> 00:49:30,484
Lou Gossett plays Sadat.

1153
00:49:30,484 --> 00:49:32,314
- Who, who's that?

1154
00:49:32,314 --> 00:49:33,832
- Anwar Sadat?

1155
00:49:33,832 --> 00:49:35,662
He's like their
best soccer player.

1156
00:49:35,662 --> 00:49:37,112
- That was a movie, man?

1157
00:49:37,112 --> 00:49:39,286
- I think it was an after
school special Oliver Stone did.

1158
00:49:39,286 --> 00:49:40,184
- I musta missed it.

1159
00:49:40,184 --> 00:49:41,012
- Word.

1160
00:49:41,012 --> 00:49:42,703
- Yeah.

1161
00:49:42,703 --> 00:49:45,361
- So this student was
very upset, he listed off

1162
00:49:45,361 --> 00:49:47,122
about ten things
that were bothering.

1163
00:49:47,122 --> 00:49:48,847
- Is it Alton Wheeler?

1164
00:49:48,847 --> 00:49:51,989
- Serious things, like
home life, his job,

1165
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:54,853
his girlfriend, and he
includes a story about a white

1166
00:49:54,853 --> 00:49:57,477
student who used the word
man at the end of each

1167
00:49:57,477 --> 00:49:59,065
of his sentences.

1168
00:49:59,065 --> 00:50:00,307
- Man?

1169
00:50:00,307 --> 00:50:01,929
- Yeah, do you want to
go to the park, man?

1170
00:50:01,929 --> 00:50:03,379
- Interesting.

1171
00:50:03,379 --> 00:50:05,588
- Well he was offended, because
he felt like this student

1172
00:50:05,588 --> 00:50:07,728
wouldn't use the word man
at the end of each of his

1173
00:50:07,728 --> 00:50:09,558
sentences if the white
student was talking to

1174
00:50:09,558 --> 00:50:11,077
another white student.

1175
00:50:11,077 --> 00:50:12,216
- Interesting.

1176
00:50:12,216 --> 00:50:13,527
- I thought so.

1177
00:50:13,527 --> 00:50:14,839
- Malcolm James?

1178
00:50:17,945 --> 00:50:21,121
- I don't know what
Affirmative Action is.

1179
00:50:21,121 --> 00:50:22,812
I'll tell you what
Affirmative Action is,

1180
00:50:22,812 --> 00:50:25,470
it's some money making
motherfuckers that want more of

1181
00:50:25,470 --> 00:50:26,782
my tax money.

1182
00:50:26,782 --> 00:50:28,266
Why don't we just
lower the transit fare

1183
00:50:28,266 --> 00:50:29,509
if you're a minority?

1184
00:50:29,509 --> 00:50:31,269
Except if you're an
Asian, because we know

1185
00:50:31,269 --> 00:50:35,204
they work twice as
hard as any of us do.

1186
00:50:35,204 --> 00:50:36,861
But enough about me.

1187
00:50:38,035 --> 00:50:40,071
What do you think
Affirmative Action is?

1188
00:50:40,071 --> 00:50:42,453
- Politicians like
to shake the trees.

1189
00:50:42,453 --> 00:50:45,007
This way people don't
think, and they don't see

1190
00:50:45,007 --> 00:50:47,354
what's really going on.

1191
00:50:47,354 --> 00:50:50,771
Affirmative action is just
a way to lower the standards

1192
00:50:50,771 --> 00:50:52,877
for people who really
haven't worked hard

1193
00:50:52,877 --> 00:50:54,982
enough in their lives.

1194
00:50:54,982 --> 00:50:58,710
Now 120 years from now
the very same white people

1195
00:50:58,710 --> 00:51:01,230
who came up with
these beneficial ideas

1196
00:51:01,230 --> 00:51:04,268
are going to think of a
new affirmative system,

1197
00:51:04,268 --> 00:51:06,166
because they're gonna be poor.

1198
00:51:06,166 --> 00:51:08,962
And maybe they're gonna call
it WPA, like the new deal

1199
00:51:08,962 --> 00:51:10,757
after The Depression.

1200
00:51:10,757 --> 00:51:12,690
- Well now, see.

1201
00:51:12,690 --> 00:51:16,694
I liken Affirmative Action
to two women in a race

1202
00:51:16,694 --> 00:51:20,146
and you put a ball and chain
around one woman, alright?

1203
00:51:20,146 --> 00:51:23,183
Fire the gun, start the
race, then halfway through,

1204
00:51:23,183 --> 00:51:26,635
you call time out and you
take the ball and chain

1205
00:51:26,635 --> 00:51:28,464
off of the woman.

1206
00:51:28,464 --> 00:51:29,948
- And give her a motorcycle
she doesn't really know

1207
00:51:29,948 --> 00:51:31,433
how to use?

1208
00:51:31,433 --> 00:51:32,744
- Now how you know she
don't know how to use it?

1209
00:51:32,744 --> 00:51:34,470
- Isn't that what
Affirmative Action is?

1210
00:51:34,470 --> 00:51:36,610
The spoils don't go to
the better qualified.

1211
00:51:36,610 --> 00:51:39,510
Viv, I'll tell you, I won't
be held accountable for some

1212
00:51:39,510 --> 00:51:40,649
great,

1213
00:51:40,649 --> 00:51:42,064
great,

1214
00:51:42,064 --> 00:51:44,342
great plantation relative
with mutton chops

1215
00:51:44,342 --> 00:51:45,999
and a big hat.

1216
00:51:45,999 --> 00:51:47,034
- Mmhmm,

1217
00:51:47,034 --> 00:51:48,657
you would if he was rich.

1218
00:51:48,657 --> 00:51:50,659
You'd be talking about oh,
yes, that's my rich relative

1219
00:51:50,659 --> 00:51:53,662
and my family tree leads
straight back to him.

1220
00:51:53,662 --> 00:51:56,251
- You can't get back at dead
people through the living.

1221
00:51:56,251 --> 00:51:58,356
- What do you mean a
multiplex community center?

1222
00:51:58,356 --> 00:52:00,531
- I mean a multiplex
community center.

1223
00:52:00,531 --> 00:52:02,809
You know how the theaters are
set up on the 4th street row,

1224
00:52:02,809 --> 00:52:04,190
the different theaters
and everything?

1225
00:52:04,190 --> 00:52:05,708
- Yeah.

1226
00:52:05,708 --> 00:52:07,193
- Well, I'm gonna do that
in the community center tip,

1227
00:52:07,193 --> 00:52:09,264
with like a, a different
organization in each room.

1228
00:52:09,264 --> 00:52:11,128
Wait, I'm gonna do something
different, with like a focus

1229
00:52:11,128 --> 00:52:12,370
on different needs.

1230
00:52:12,370 --> 00:52:14,096
You get to decide
where you wanna go.

1231
00:52:14,096 --> 00:52:15,649
- First up, if it's
like a multiplex,

1232
00:52:15,649 --> 00:52:18,273
those rooms are way too
small to set up anything.

1233
00:52:18,273 --> 00:52:20,482
I mean, some of those rooms
only hold like, 30 seats.

1234
00:52:20,482 --> 00:52:22,000
- Who said I'm gonna
need that much?

1235
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,485
- Hold on, hold on, and
the second thing is,

1236
00:52:23,485 --> 00:52:25,763
you wouldn't be near any hood
if you made it to the pros.

1237
00:52:25,763 --> 00:52:27,558
- First of all, I'm making it.

1238
00:52:27,558 --> 00:52:29,939
Second, I ain't gonna
switch after I make it.

1239
00:52:29,939 --> 00:52:33,184
- Oh, come on, kid, you'd
have mad girls, a condo,

1240
00:52:33,184 --> 00:52:34,012
a Benz.

1241
00:52:34,012 --> 00:52:35,635
- You see those Benzes?

1242
00:52:35,635 --> 00:52:37,740
They're making 'em
like fucking Fords.

1243
00:52:37,740 --> 00:52:40,053
Now you see a Lexus,
a Lexus, that's a car.

1244
00:52:40,053 --> 00:52:41,537
- True, yeah.

1245
00:52:41,537 --> 00:52:43,056
- But yo, man, you're
gonna get too comfortable.

1246
00:52:43,056 --> 00:52:47,923
I mean like endorsements,
business deals, family.

1247
00:52:47,923 --> 00:52:49,925
And you forget, I know
you, you cut people off

1248
00:52:49,925 --> 00:52:52,203
mad quick, so you're not
gonna care about fuck ups

1249
00:52:52,203 --> 00:52:53,031
in the hood.

1250
00:52:53,031 --> 00:52:54,585
- I changed, alright.

1251
00:52:54,585 --> 00:52:56,932
- Besides, say you got your
little money or what not.

1252
00:52:56,932 --> 00:52:58,658
You're not gonna go

1253
00:52:58,658 --> 00:53:00,038
save the world.

1254
00:53:00,038 --> 00:53:01,730
- Who says I'm trying
to save the world?

1255
00:53:01,730 --> 00:53:02,765
Brother's just trying
to make a little

1256
00:53:02,765 --> 00:53:04,388
community center, man.

1257
00:53:04,388 --> 00:53:06,252
- If it was that easy, a
bunch of pros would have made

1258
00:53:06,252 --> 00:53:09,082
some consortium and go
for it, did that already.

1259
00:53:09,082 --> 00:53:10,014
- Can I talk now?

1260
00:53:10,014 --> 00:53:11,049
- Go ahead, man, I wansn't.

1261
00:53:11,049 --> 00:53:11,947
- Yo, can I talk now?

1262
00:53:11,947 --> 00:53:13,397
- Go ahead, man.

1263
00:53:13,397 --> 00:53:14,915
- So, like,

1264
00:53:14,915 --> 00:53:16,089
the only reason it hasn't been
done is 'cause there hasn't

1265
00:53:16,089 --> 00:53:18,160
been any pros conscious
enough to lead them.

1266
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:19,644
- Bullshit.

1267
00:53:19,644 --> 00:53:21,681
- I don't see any
cornrows in your head.

1268
00:53:21,681 --> 00:53:24,062
- Like I was saying, I'll
lead all the other pros,

1269
00:53:24,062 --> 00:53:26,444
like an Oprah or somebody
and we'll fight ignorance

1270
00:53:26,444 --> 00:53:28,101
and poverty with the multiplex.

1271
00:53:28,101 --> 00:53:30,828
- You been smelling way too
much comic book ink, man.

1272
00:53:30,828 --> 00:53:32,968
- What's this, oh shit,
it's Super Black Man

1273
00:53:32,968 --> 00:53:34,176
coming to a hood near you.

1274
00:53:34,176 --> 00:53:36,316
- Oh shit, that was funny.

1275
00:53:36,316 --> 00:53:38,594
- Besides, no one ever does
that after they make it.

1276
00:53:38,594 --> 00:53:40,493
I mean, even Doctor
Huxtable doesn't do that.

1277
00:53:40,493 --> 00:53:42,771
- Come on, man, Cosby
Show isn't representative.

1278
00:53:42,771 --> 00:53:44,082
- Why not?

1279
00:53:44,082 --> 00:53:45,843
- It's like, too perfect.

1280
00:53:45,843 --> 00:53:47,120
- Your family is like that.

1281
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:48,742
- My family is not
like The Cosby Show.

1282
00:53:48,742 --> 00:53:51,055
- Besides, if you're
going back fight dealers,

1283
00:53:51,055 --> 00:53:53,264
crack heads and tech tens,
I mean you better get

1284
00:53:53,264 --> 00:53:54,748
some Kevlar hip hop gear.

1285
00:53:54,748 --> 00:53:56,233
- Yo, they make that shit?

1286
00:53:56,233 --> 00:53:57,751
- Yup, seen it in a magazine.

1287
00:53:57,751 --> 00:53:58,959
- Word?

1288
00:53:58,959 --> 00:54:00,409
They have like
bullet proof baggies?

1289
00:54:00,409 --> 00:54:01,755
- I don't know, probably.

1290
00:54:01,755 --> 00:54:02,998
- That's dope.

1291
00:54:02,998 --> 00:54:04,413
Like, rappers should
wear that shit.

1292
00:54:04,413 --> 00:54:07,934
- Straight up, maybe
Biggie still be alive.

1293
00:54:07,934 --> 00:54:10,074
- Okay, okay, one more time.

1294
00:54:10,074 --> 00:54:11,248
Keith Jarrett.

1295
00:54:11,248 --> 00:54:12,870
Bad motherfucker, right?

1296
00:54:12,870 --> 00:54:15,286
Own some of his albums myself.

1297
00:54:15,286 --> 00:54:18,807
But, yo, I never knew
he was a white man.

1298
00:54:18,807 --> 00:54:20,774
- I didn't know that either.

1299
00:54:20,774 --> 00:54:22,604
Didn't he have a big
afro back in the day?

1300
00:54:22,604 --> 00:54:24,019
- Fooled me, too.

1301
00:54:24,019 --> 00:54:26,090
I mean, I suppose it's
because in the time

1302
00:54:26,090 --> 00:54:28,506
Red born white boys
had afros, too.

1303
00:54:28,506 --> 00:54:31,268
Now don't you suppose
Keith cashed in on that?

1304
00:54:31,268 --> 00:54:32,545
- How?

1305
00:54:32,545 --> 00:54:35,030
- I bought this shit
because he's black.

1306
00:54:35,030 --> 00:54:36,825
- Yeah, but that's 'cause
you were Afro-centric

1307
00:54:36,825 --> 00:54:38,033
colored glass.

1308
00:54:38,033 --> 00:54:40,000
- Ray Ban was a black man, baby.

1309
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,312
- Was he?

1310
00:54:41,312 --> 00:54:44,660
- I don't know,
sounds like it though.

1311
00:54:44,660 --> 00:54:47,560
- And how do you account for
white people like myself?

1312
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:49,424
My ancestors didn't
come here until 40 years

1313
00:54:49,424 --> 00:54:51,046
after slavery.

1314
00:54:51,046 --> 00:54:55,050
And during slavery, they were
getting killed in Poland.

1315
00:54:55,050 --> 00:54:56,569
And it was only 40 years
after they got here

1316
00:54:56,569 --> 00:54:59,365
they were able to
afford a tv set.

1317
00:54:59,365 --> 00:55:00,849
They didn't own a plantation.

1318
00:55:00,849 --> 00:55:03,265
The plantation for them
was a two bedroom apartment

1319
00:55:03,265 --> 00:55:04,680
in Forrest Hills.

1320
00:55:05,647 --> 00:55:07,994
- But, white people are a race.

1321
00:55:07,994 --> 00:55:10,272
And yesterday and today,
being in that race

1322
00:55:10,272 --> 00:55:11,929
has its privileges.

1323
00:55:11,929 --> 00:55:13,655
- The White Card.

1324
00:55:13,655 --> 00:55:17,590
Don't leave the guard-gate
community without it.

1325
00:55:17,590 --> 00:55:18,936
- I mean, really,

1326
00:55:20,386 --> 00:55:24,044
even the subtle stuff like
you walk into a retail store,

1327
00:55:24,044 --> 00:55:26,668
you're above suspicion.

1328
00:55:26,668 --> 00:55:30,188
My black man with dreads
walks in, he's a thief.

1329
00:55:30,188 --> 00:55:32,605
You go to a bank to get
a loan, my black sisters

1330
00:55:32,605 --> 00:55:35,987
can't get one, and she might
be making more money than you.

1331
00:55:35,987 --> 00:55:37,403
Sorry, baby,

1332
00:55:37,403 --> 00:55:39,025
that white card you carry?

1333
00:55:39,025 --> 00:55:40,682
That has privileges.

1334
00:55:40,682 --> 00:55:41,959
My green card?

1335
00:55:41,959 --> 00:55:43,305
I got to pay back
on it every month.

1336
00:55:43,305 --> 00:55:45,721
And I don't care what you say,

1337
00:55:45,721 --> 00:55:48,310
no white person
wants to be black.

1338
00:55:48,310 --> 00:55:50,347
They don't want to
trade places with us.

1339
00:55:50,347 --> 00:55:51,796
Why would they?

1340
00:55:51,796 --> 00:55:53,971
Oh, they, they
wanna steal our shit

1341
00:55:53,971 --> 00:55:55,490
and play our music and all that,

1342
00:55:55,490 --> 00:55:57,526
act like us, them
little wiggers,

1343
00:55:57,526 --> 00:55:59,701
them little white kids
that wanna act black.

1344
00:55:59,701 --> 00:56:00,667
- Yeah, boy.

1345
00:56:03,498 --> 00:56:06,363
- They talk the talk but
they're not walking the walk.

1346
00:56:06,363 --> 00:56:08,399
They don't really
wanna be black.

1347
00:56:08,399 --> 00:56:10,159
And you know what,
they couldn't be.

1348
00:56:10,159 --> 00:56:11,609
'Cause it's not
their experience.

1349
00:56:11,609 --> 00:56:13,818
They just want to be Elvis.

1350
00:56:14,992 --> 00:56:17,753
- I agree, there's
still discrimination.

1351
00:56:17,753 --> 00:56:20,100
- Enough to endorse a
policy to that gives someone

1352
00:56:20,100 --> 00:56:22,137
preferential treatment on
the basis of skin color?

1353
00:56:22,137 --> 00:56:23,518
- No.

1354
00:56:23,518 --> 00:56:26,831
There's economic inequality
on a large scale.

1355
00:56:26,831 --> 00:56:29,144
'Cause see, you're
thinking Affirmative Action

1356
00:56:29,144 --> 00:56:32,975
is a black thing, and it's
not, it's a people thing.

1357
00:56:32,975 --> 00:56:35,461
And that's a racist thing.

1358
00:56:35,461 --> 00:56:36,738
- I'm a racist?

1359
00:56:36,738 --> 00:56:38,187
My son Ken is black.

1360
00:56:38,187 --> 00:56:41,121
- And I bet you say
he's your best friend.

1361
00:56:41,121 --> 00:56:44,090
- I've raised him to
feel that way, yes.

1362
00:56:44,090 --> 00:56:47,265
- You take these subtleties of

1363
00:56:47,265 --> 00:56:50,130
African American students
sitting together,

1364
00:56:50,130 --> 00:56:52,892
or the use of the word man,

1365
00:56:52,892 --> 00:56:54,238
they lead to these

1366
00:56:54,238 --> 00:56:56,343
intense feelings?

1367
00:56:56,343 --> 00:56:59,381
Now what about not
so subtle factors?

1368
00:57:00,555 --> 00:57:01,348
Like

1369
00:57:03,074 --> 00:57:05,352
quotas on Affirmative Action?

1370
00:57:05,352 --> 00:57:06,181
- Hmm.

1371
00:57:07,665 --> 00:57:10,323
- Well Shelby Steele said
that the blacks are paying

1372
00:57:10,323 --> 00:57:12,256
a heavy price for these

1373
00:57:12,256 --> 00:57:15,259
university letter
acceptances that are based on

1374
00:57:15,259 --> 00:57:17,779
lower academic achievement.

1375
00:57:17,779 --> 00:57:19,988
- I knew you didn't believe
in Affirmative Action.

1376
00:57:19,988 --> 00:57:22,542
- Now, I didn't say that.

1377
00:57:22,542 --> 00:57:24,889
- You believe that Affirmative
Action will make us

1378
00:57:24,889 --> 00:57:26,788
more competitive, I don't.

1379
00:57:26,788 --> 00:57:29,584
- And I want Ken to
succeed on his own.

1380
00:57:29,584 --> 00:57:31,896
I know it's not a black thing,

1381
00:57:31,896 --> 00:57:35,831
but if Affirmative Action
gets him into Harvard,

1382
00:57:35,831 --> 00:57:38,420
I wanna throw a party and
live vicariously through him

1383
00:57:38,420 --> 00:57:41,216
as if my shit smelled from ivy,

1384
00:57:41,216 --> 00:57:43,977
because I know if he's in
Harvard, his life is set.

1385
00:57:43,977 --> 00:57:45,531
- There's more responsibility
on the black athlete

1386
00:57:45,531 --> 00:57:47,498
to give something back.

1387
00:57:47,498 --> 00:57:49,707
- Man, that's that old
thought that athletes who move

1388
00:57:49,707 --> 00:57:51,364
out of the hood and
into a nice neighborhood

1389
00:57:51,364 --> 00:57:52,399
are selling out.

1390
00:57:52,399 --> 00:57:53,711
And that ain't right.

1391
00:57:53,711 --> 00:57:55,541
Did you know that when
Jews first moved here,

1392
00:57:55,541 --> 00:57:56,852
they lived in ghettos
and they were like

1393
00:57:56,852 --> 00:57:58,440
the best boxers around?

1394
00:57:58,440 --> 00:57:59,959
- Yo,

1395
00:57:59,959 --> 00:58:01,201
just don't even give me
that great white hope jazz

1396
00:58:01,201 --> 00:58:03,031
because there's plenty
of white boxers,

1397
00:58:03,031 --> 00:58:04,895
and if you dissolved hockey,
there'd be plenty of them

1398
00:58:04,895 --> 00:58:06,413

01:04:22,582 --> 01:04:25,413
Yeah, hi, your son is here.

1570
01:04:25,413 --> 01:04:26,241
Okay.

1571
01:04:28,105 --> 01:04:30,832
He says he'll be
out in a second.

1572
01:04:31,695 --> 01:04:33,352
- So how's it going?

1573
01:04:34,594 --> 01:04:36,010
- You really wanna know?

1574
01:04:36,010 --> 01:04:37,287
- Go ahead.

1575
01:04:37,287 --> 01:04:38,253
- Do you know that I
doubled majored at?

1576
01:04:38,253 --> 01:04:39,772
- Excuse me, sweetie,

1577
01:04:39,772 --> 01:04:41,601
I think you can take a break
from your dating schedule here

1578
01:04:41,601 --> 01:04:45,157
and free my triathlon
application, please.

1579
01:04:45,157 --> 01:04:46,675
- Sure, excuse me.

1580
01:04:46,675 --> 01:04:48,919
Excuse me for a moment.

1581
01:04:48,919 --> 01:04:49,713
Here you go.

1582
01:04:49,713 --> 01:04:50,541
- Hi, son.

1583
01:04:52,060 --> 01:04:52,889
- Dad.

1584
01:04:54,545 --> 01:04:57,100
- Veronica doesn't think it's
uncool for you to hug me,

1585
01:04:57,100 --> 01:04:58,653
do you, Veronica?

1586
01:04:58,653 --> 01:05:01,449
- No, not half as uncool as
that outfit you're wearing.

1587
01:05:01,449 --> 01:05:03,520
It's not very GQ today, is it?

1588
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:04,521
- It's not?

1589
01:05:04,521 --> 01:05:05,487
- No.

1590
01:05:05,487 --> 01:05:07,006
- Oh, my feelings are hurt.

1591
01:05:07,006 --> 01:05:08,490
What do you mean, I saw it
in the magazine right here.

1592
01:05:08,490 --> 01:05:09,940
- Well, if you let me
buy some new magazines,

1593
01:05:09,940 --> 01:05:11,562
you might get a
current wardrobe.

1594
01:05:11,562 --> 01:05:12,874
- Oh, touche.

1595
01:05:12,874 --> 01:05:15,394
- Ma let you go out of
the house like that?

1596
01:05:15,394 --> 01:05:16,740
- Yeah, ma let me come out
of the house like that.

1597
01:05:16,740 --> 01:05:18,086
What's, what's, alright?

1598
01:05:18,086 --> 01:05:19,329
What's going on, you alright?

1599
01:05:19,329 --> 01:05:20,778
- Can we go talk over there?

1600
01:05:20,778 --> 01:05:21,952
- You sure, everything alright?

1601
01:05:21,952 --> 01:05:22,746
- Yeah, yeah.

1602
01:05:22,746 --> 01:05:23,574
- Alright.

1603
01:05:23,574 --> 01:05:24,851
- Bye, Veronica.

1604
01:05:24,851 --> 01:05:27,164
- Bye, Kenny, it was
good to see you again.

1605
01:05:27,164 --> 01:05:28,717
- So what's up?

1606
01:05:28,717 --> 01:05:30,236
- I just need a buck fifty
for that class trip deal.

1607
01:05:30,236 --> 01:05:31,065
- Hundred fifty?

1608
01:05:31,065 --> 01:05:32,514
- Mmhmm.

1609
01:05:32,514 --> 01:05:33,688
- Hi, this is my son, Ken.

1610
01:05:33,688 --> 01:05:34,516
You remember Ken?

1611
01:05:34,516 --> 01:05:35,379
- Hey.

1612
01:05:35,379 --> 01:05:36,622
- That's Viv and Rich.

1613
01:05:36,622 --> 01:05:37,278
- Haven't seen y'all
in awhile, what's up?

1614
01:05:37,278 --> 01:05:38,555
- How you doing?

1615
01:05:38,555 --> 01:05:39,728
- I'm alright, going
to school, you know,

1616
01:05:39,728 --> 01:05:41,868
I have to get back soon.

1617
01:05:41,868 --> 01:05:43,042
- He's doing very well.

1618
01:05:43,042 --> 01:05:43,870
- Is he?

1619
01:05:43,870 --> 01:05:45,079
- Yes, he is.

1620
01:05:45,079 --> 01:05:46,011
- You're taller than
your father now.

1621
01:05:46,011 --> 01:05:47,633
- Well.

1622
01:05:47,633 --> 01:05:48,599
- That ain't hard.

1623
01:05:48,599 --> 01:05:50,843
- That's why I'm holding him.

1624
01:05:50,843 --> 01:05:52,258
See you, see you in a
little while, alright?

1625
01:05:52,258 --> 01:05:53,121
- Bye bye.

1626
01:05:53,121 --> 01:05:54,329
- Bye, Ken.

1627
01:05:54,329 --> 01:05:55,882
- So you wouldn't get
Sharisse a Barbie?

1628
01:05:55,882 --> 01:05:57,401
- Never.

1629
01:05:57,401 --> 01:05:58,644
- Because you don't want
her to grow up and idolize

1630
01:05:58,644 --> 01:06:01,888
Cindy Crawford or
anyone like that?

1631
01:06:01,888 --> 01:06:03,200
- No, because I,

1632
01:06:06,031 --> 01:06:08,516
I don't think you'd really
understand the issues.

1633
01:06:08,516 --> 01:06:10,345
- Believe it or not, I've been
understanding these issues

1634
01:06:10,345 --> 01:06:12,244
all morning and I think
I'm very qualified to go

1635
01:06:12,244 --> 01:06:13,970
wherever you want to on this.

1636
01:06:13,970 --> 01:06:15,523
- Really?

1637
01:06:15,523 --> 01:06:17,214
- What'd you do this morning.

1638
01:06:17,214 --> 01:06:18,181
- Don't ask.

1639
01:06:19,044 --> 01:06:19,872
Come on.

1640
01:06:21,667 --> 01:06:26,361
- What I know is that society
puts a lot of pressure

1641
01:06:26,361 --> 01:06:28,260
on little black girls
to look a certain way

1642
01:06:28,260 --> 01:06:29,744
that they can never look.

1643
01:06:29,744 --> 01:06:31,297
They're little black girls,
they're not little white girls.

1644
01:06:31,297 --> 01:06:32,540
- Sharisse is beautiful.

1645
01:06:32,540 --> 01:06:34,266
- Well I know that.

1646
01:06:34,266 --> 01:06:35,992
You know I know that.

1647
01:06:36,889 --> 01:06:37,717
But,

1648
01:06:39,133 --> 01:06:42,032
she doesn't have any icons
to look up to, really.

1649
01:06:42,032 --> 01:06:45,484
I mean, all the icons
are white Europeans.

1650
01:06:45,484 --> 01:06:47,141
And

1651
01:06:47,141 --> 01:06:51,490
if you really think about what
society considers beautiful,

1652
01:06:51,490 --> 01:06:53,147
it's not my people.

1653
01:06:53,147 --> 01:06:55,390
It's not her people.

1654
01:06:55,390 --> 01:06:58,911
It's my white ancestors
on my mother's side.

1655
01:06:58,911 --> 01:07:01,603
And little black girls
wanna be attractive.

1656
01:07:01,603 --> 01:07:03,605
- She discover boys yet?

1657
01:07:05,262 --> 01:07:07,713
- Well she has
discovered Plymouth Rock,

1658
01:07:07,713 --> 01:07:09,749
but I'm not letting
her get off the boat.

1659
01:07:09,749 --> 01:07:11,268
- So you're afraid that what,

1660
01:07:11,268 --> 01:07:13,236
when that time comes, she's
gonna wanna color her hair

1661
01:07:13,236 --> 01:07:15,065
blond or something?

1662
01:07:15,065 --> 01:07:17,309
- I don't know, I hope not.

1663
01:07:18,620 --> 01:07:21,589
It would hurt me if
she wanted to do that.

1664
01:07:21,589 --> 01:07:23,970
But it doesn't even
have to be that drastic.

1665
01:07:23,970 --> 01:07:25,731
Just straightening
has an effect.

1666
01:07:25,731 --> 01:07:28,492
- White women bleach
their hair all the time.

1667
01:07:28,492 --> 01:07:32,048
- White women bleach their
hair to look like white women.

1668
01:07:32,048 --> 01:07:33,946
Why should a black woman
bleach her hair to look

1669
01:07:33,946 --> 01:07:35,465
like a white woman?

1670
01:07:35,465 --> 01:07:38,192
Or straighten her hair to
look like a white woman?

1671
01:07:38,192 --> 01:07:42,196
I mean, why can't we be
beautiful as black women?

1672
01:07:46,924 --> 01:07:49,237
- There are Latina Barbies.

1673
01:07:49,237 --> 01:07:51,101
- Nah, they're just white
Barbies dipped in chocolate,

1674
01:07:51,101 --> 01:07:53,690
they got no hips, lips or nose.

1675
01:07:56,175 --> 01:07:57,487
- Sorry, guys.

1676
01:07:57,487 --> 01:07:59,005
- So how's Ken?

1677
01:07:59,005 --> 01:08:00,904
- Oh he's fine, it's just
a little money matter.

1678
01:08:00,904 --> 01:08:02,423
- Isn't it always?

1679
01:08:02,423 --> 01:08:04,356
- Yeah, I wish there was a
flat rate with kids, right?

1680
01:08:04,356 --> 01:08:05,909
- Tell me about it,
Sherisse is growing so fast

1681
01:08:05,909 --> 01:08:08,463
I think it'd be cost-effective
for me to have another one.

1682
01:08:08,463 --> 01:08:09,775
- Suppose it's a boy?

1683
01:08:09,775 --> 01:08:12,364
- Then I hope he don't
mind cross-dressing.

1684
01:08:12,364 --> 01:08:13,641
- So,

1685
01:08:13,641 --> 01:08:16,161
listen, what do you guys
think about my outfit?

1686
01:08:16,161 --> 01:08:16,989
- Not bad.

1687
01:08:19,198 --> 01:08:21,476
- Not bad if you're running
a casino in Connecticut.

1688
01:08:21,476 --> 01:08:23,720
[laughing]

1689
01:08:25,031 --> 01:08:26,550
- It's not that funny.

1690
01:08:26,550 --> 01:08:28,794
- Come on, now, don't you
think Affirmative Action

1691
01:08:28,794 --> 01:08:31,176
draws attention to race?

1692
01:08:31,176 --> 01:08:34,938
It elevates the myth of
the black stereotype?

1693
01:08:40,288 --> 01:08:41,117
- My.

1694
01:08:42,497 --> 01:08:43,326
No please.

1695
01:08:44,672 --> 01:08:45,569
- Kielbasa!

1696
01:08:47,157 --> 01:08:49,332
- White middle class
values should not determine

1697
01:08:49,332 --> 01:08:51,092
what black students
should learn.

1698
01:08:51,092 --> 01:08:51,920
- Oh, so,

1699
01:08:53,508 --> 01:08:57,650
then asking a black inner
city student a question like

1700
01:08:59,100 --> 01:09:02,448
what do you feed a baby
cow, that's unfair?

1701
01:09:02,448 --> 01:09:03,380
Oh, okay,

1702
01:09:03,380 --> 01:09:05,141
if that's so then

1703
01:09:05,141 --> 01:09:09,214
asking a white, suburban
student about sewer caps

1704
01:09:09,214 --> 01:09:10,042
is unfair?

1705
01:09:11,216 --> 01:09:12,527
- Can we table this now?

1706
01:09:12,527 --> 01:09:14,771
- Oh yeah, hey, I'm satisfied.

1707
01:09:14,771 --> 01:09:17,912
I asked for what you
felt, and you told me.

1708
01:09:17,912 --> 01:09:20,363
- Yeah, but I hope that
you weren't taping this to,

1709
01:09:20,363 --> 01:09:22,054
you know, bring some sort
of a racial class suit

1710
01:09:22,054 --> 01:09:23,331
against us.

1711
01:09:23,331 --> 01:09:24,677
- Would you like to
check me for wires?

1712
01:09:24,677 --> 01:09:25,644
- No.

1713
01:09:25,644 --> 01:09:26,921
- That's sexual harassment.

1714
01:09:26,921 --> 01:09:29,717
- You guys are just
uptight white boys.

1715
01:09:29,717 --> 01:09:32,133
- Just a sign of the times.

1716
01:09:32,133 --> 01:09:35,619
- I'm gonna step out for awhile.

1717
01:09:35,619 --> 01:09:37,311
Okay, I'll be back later.

1718
01:09:37,311 --> 01:09:38,691
- Okay.

1719
01:09:38,691 --> 01:09:39,796
- I'll be back later, Veronica.

1720
01:09:39,796 --> 01:09:41,556
- Oh, hold on a second.

1721
01:09:41,556 --> 01:09:42,557
Here you go.

1722
01:09:44,559 --> 01:09:46,251
- Thanks, I'll bring
you a cappuccino.

1723
01:09:46,251 --> 01:09:48,287
- Great, have a good day.

1724
01:09:49,771 --> 01:09:52,498
[romantic music]

1725
01:09:58,332 --> 01:10:00,886
[upbeat music]

1726
01:10:23,011 --> 01:10:24,530
- Hi, I'm here to
see Nicole Thompson.

1727
01:10:24,530 --> 01:10:26,739
It's not urgent, so if she
has a class or something?

1728
01:10:26,739 --> 01:10:28,500
- No, actually she's
talking to the Principal

1729
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:30,571
down the hall in room 222.

1730
01:10:30,571 --> 01:10:31,675
Just through that corridor.

1731
01:10:31,675 --> 01:10:32,676
- Thank you.

1732
01:10:37,819 --> 01:10:39,511
- What are we gonna
do about the problem

1733
01:10:39,511 --> 01:10:40,719
we're going through right now?

1734
01:10:40,719 --> 01:10:42,341
You got any ideas?

1735
01:10:42,341 --> 01:10:43,998
- No, I mean I think it's
our job as administration

1736
01:10:43,998 --> 01:10:46,828
to try and work
it out, work out.

1737
01:10:46,828 --> 01:10:47,657
- I wonder

1738
01:10:49,624 --> 01:10:52,144
if we could just sort of

1739
01:10:52,144 --> 01:10:53,456
attack

1740
01:10:53,456 --> 01:10:55,906
these subtleties, you know?

1741
01:10:55,906 --> 01:10:57,736
Make them overt.

1742
01:10:57,736 --> 01:11:00,601
Bring them to light,
maybe that will

1743
01:11:00,601 --> 01:11:03,224
get rid of a lot of
this misunderstanding.

1744
01:11:03,224 --> 01:11:05,330
- I don't think we can
eliminate the problem

1745
01:11:05,330 --> 01:11:06,883
of subtlety itself.

1746
01:11:08,402 --> 01:11:10,818
Maybe certain instances,
like the use of the word man,

1747
01:11:10,818 --> 01:11:12,129
will be brought
out into the open,

1748
01:11:12,129 --> 01:11:13,890
but there's always
gonna be subtleties,

1749
01:11:13,890 --> 01:11:16,686
because of the murky
nature of the human mind.

1750
01:11:16,686 --> 01:11:18,757
- Well, that's interesting.

1751
01:11:18,757 --> 01:11:21,415
- Take, for example, you and me.

1752
01:11:21,415 --> 01:11:24,141
As I listen to you,
I'm scanning you,

1753
01:11:24,141 --> 01:11:26,212
and each time you
say interesting,

1754
01:11:26,212 --> 01:11:28,422
I make a silent assessment.

1755
01:11:31,563 --> 01:11:33,496
- Aren't they there?

1756
01:11:33,496 --> 01:11:36,119
- I think they're busy.

1757
01:11:36,119 --> 01:11:37,603
Can I just wait over here?

1758
01:11:37,603 --> 01:11:38,432
- Yeah.

1759
01:11:42,367 --> 01:11:44,058
- Do I say interesting a lot?

1760
01:11:44,058 --> 01:11:45,370
- Yes.

1761
01:11:45,370 --> 01:11:46,474
And each time you do,

1762
01:11:46,474 --> 01:11:48,027
I make a judgment.

1763
01:11:48,027 --> 01:11:51,514
Does he mean interesting as
in he thinks I'm full of shit?

1764
01:11:51,514 --> 01:11:53,274
Interesting as in interesting?

1765
01:11:53,274 --> 01:11:56,070
Interesting as in I never
thought of that before?

1766
01:11:56,070 --> 01:11:58,693
Interesting, I'll have
the seafood salad today.

1767
01:11:58,693 --> 01:12:00,454
- That's interesting.

1768
01:12:04,147 --> 01:12:06,322
- Good afternoon, look
at that beautiful sister

1769
01:12:06,322 --> 01:12:07,530
behind the desk.

1770
01:12:07,530 --> 01:12:08,496
I'm here to see
my friend Michael,

1771
01:12:08,496 --> 01:12:09,704
he's speaking this afternoon.

1772
01:12:09,704 --> 01:12:11,499
My name is Mustafa,
I'll just see my way in,

1773
01:12:11,499 --> 01:12:12,328
don't move.

1774
01:12:12,328 --> 01:12:13,743
- Excuse me, who?

1775
01:12:14,985 --> 01:12:16,711
- Michael, my friend
Michael is speaking

1776
01:12:16,711 --> 01:12:18,437
in the auditorium, I'll
just find my way in.

1777
01:12:18,437 --> 01:12:19,576
- I don't know
your friend Michael

1778
01:12:19,576 --> 01:12:22,924
and I don't know about a speech.

1779
01:12:22,924 --> 01:12:25,306
- Okay, my friend Michael,

1780
01:12:25,306 --> 01:12:26,894
he's speaking in the auditorium.

1781
01:12:26,894 --> 01:12:28,171
- Yeah, I heard that.

1782
01:12:28,171 --> 01:12:29,345
- I'll just find my
way in, it's fine.

1783
01:12:29,345 --> 01:12:31,588
- No, um, what's your name?

1784
01:12:33,072 --> 01:12:34,488
- Mustafa.

1785
01:12:34,488 --> 01:12:36,041
My name is Mustafa.

1786
01:12:36,041 --> 01:12:37,974
- Well, Mister Mustafa, I
don't have your name here

1787
01:12:37,974 --> 01:12:39,734
on my list, so can you
have a seat and wait

1788
01:12:39,734 --> 01:12:40,977
for your friend
Michael to come out,

1789
01:12:40,977 --> 01:12:42,358
if he's in there?

1790
01:12:44,808 --> 01:12:45,947
- Yeah, alright.

1791
01:12:45,947 --> 01:12:46,776
- Okay.

1792
01:12:55,474 --> 01:12:58,926
- Well, if you're right
about these subtleties,

1793
01:12:58,926 --> 01:13:00,755
then I guess there's
not much hope

1794
01:13:00,755 --> 01:13:03,102
for a continued understanding.

1795
01:13:03,102 --> 01:13:05,173
- Well let's not walk away
from hope too quickly.

1796
01:13:05,173 --> 01:13:07,728
[bell ringing]

1797
01:13:09,523 --> 01:13:10,351
- Hey man.

1798
01:13:13,906 --> 01:13:16,771
Hey, Michael Gray, I'm here
speaking for the assembly with

1799
01:13:16,771 --> 01:13:17,910
Miss Thompson.

1800

[hip hop music]

1801
01:13:49,459 --> 01:13:52,462
- So today's guest
speaker is Michael Gray.

1802
01:13:52,462 --> 01:13:55,223
He's a freelance writer
for several major magazines

1803
01:13:55,223 --> 01:13:57,571
and he'll be addressing
the topic of race.

1804
01:13:57,571 --> 01:13:58,882
Let's welcome him.

1805
01:13:58,882 --> 01:14:01,126
[applause]

1806
01:14:09,445 --> 01:14:10,273
- Honkeys.

1807
01:14:11,343 --> 01:14:12,171
Niggers.

1808
01:14:13,690 --> 01:14:15,105
Spics.

1809
01:14:15,105 --> 01:14:16,279
Kikes.

1810
01:14:16,279 --> 01:14:17,453
Wops.

1811
01:14:17,453 --> 01:14:18,281
Wetbacks.

1812
01:14:19,765 --> 01:14:20,697
Frogs.

1813
01:14:20,697 --> 01:14:21,595
Krauts.

1814
01:14:21,595 --> 01:14:22,492
Chinks.

1815
01:14:22,492 --> 01:14:23,528
Dotheads.

1816
01:14:23,528 --> 01:14:25,599
Gooks, Polacks and mixed.

1817
01:14:27,221 --> 01:14:28,049
Greetings.

1818
01:14:30,086 --> 01:14:30,914
Now.

1819
01:14:32,122 --> 01:14:34,055
Don't sit back or
get comfortable.

1820
01:14:34,055 --> 01:14:36,886
Move to the edge of
your seat and get ready,

1821
01:14:36,886 --> 01:14:39,682
'cause this isn't
gonna be any speech.

1822
01:14:39,682 --> 01:14:40,510
No.

1823
01:14:41,718 --> 01:14:44,272
Not letting you off that easy.

1824
01:14:44,272 --> 01:14:45,964
If we're gonna deal with race,

1825
01:14:45,964 --> 01:14:49,761
we're gonna deal with it
the best way I know how.

1826
01:14:49,761 --> 01:14:51,797
We're gonna talk about it.

1827
01:14:51,797 --> 01:14:53,868
So instead of 80 per cent
speech and 20 per cent

1828
01:14:53,868 --> 01:14:58,563
question and answer, it's
gonna be the other way around.

1829
01:14:58,563 --> 01:15:03,119
And first, I'm gonna
tell you a little story.

1830
01:15:03,119 --> 01:15:05,673
Once upon a time,
there was a young man

1831
01:15:05,673 --> 01:15:08,607
driving his horse and
carriage down a narrow road,

1832
01:15:08,607 --> 01:15:11,955
barely wide enough for a Yugo.

1833
01:15:11,955 --> 01:15:15,062
Now the young man was an
orphan, never knew his father.

1834
01:15:15,062 --> 01:15:16,304
But that didn't deter him

1835
01:15:16,304 --> 01:15:18,134
from being a good man.

1836
01:15:20,343 --> 01:15:22,345
So he's driving down
this road, right?

1837
01:15:22,345 --> 01:15:25,175
And then comes this old man.

1838
01:15:25,175 --> 01:15:26,832
The old man

1839
01:15:26,832 --> 01:15:29,214
had no son, or so he thought.

1840
01:15:30,353 --> 01:15:33,390
But not having a
son didn't stop him

1841
01:15:33,390 --> 01:15:35,220
from being a good man.

1842
01:15:37,740 --> 01:15:39,465
So what do you think happened

1843
01:15:39,465 --> 01:15:41,295
when these two good men meet

1844
01:15:41,295 --> 01:15:46,024
on this old, narrow road barely
wide enough to fit a Yugo?

1845
01:15:46,024 --> 01:15:47,784
The good men get
into an argument

1846
01:15:47,784 --> 01:15:49,924
about which good man should
back up and let the other

1847
01:15:49,924 --> 01:15:51,995
good man get by.

1848
01:15:51,995 --> 01:15:54,895
Then the young good man,
being young and in a rush

1849
01:15:54,895 --> 01:15:58,070
to make a booty call, picks
up a stone from the side

1850
01:15:58,070 --> 01:15:59,589
of the old, narrow road

1851
01:15:59,589 --> 01:16:02,972
barely wide enough to
fit a Yugo and bop!

1852
01:16:05,146 --> 01:16:08,218
Hits the old good man on
his vulnerable, old head,

1853
01:16:08,218 --> 01:16:09,875
killing the old man.

1854
01:16:10,842 --> 01:16:12,671
- That's messed up.

1855
01:16:12,671 --> 01:16:13,499
- Word.

1856
01:16:14,949 --> 01:16:17,434
- Now some of you may think
that's just another story

1857
01:16:17,434 --> 01:16:20,955
about road rage,
and you'd be right.

1858
01:16:20,955 --> 01:16:23,233
But some of you may also see
it as the beginning of the

1859
01:16:23,233 --> 01:16:26,271
Greek myth Oedipus Rex,
where the young man

1860
01:16:26,271 --> 01:16:28,998
unknowingly kills his dad.

1861
01:16:28,998 --> 01:16:29,826
Tell me,

1862
01:16:31,241 --> 01:16:33,174
do you think the good young
man would have killed,

1863
01:16:33,174 --> 01:16:35,832
hit or even raised a
rock to the good old man

1864
01:16:35,832 --> 01:16:39,905
if he knew it was his
good old missing dad?

1865
01:16:39,905 --> 01:16:41,044
Of course not.

1866
01:16:42,183 --> 01:16:43,012
My point.

1867
01:16:44,151 --> 01:16:45,808
Get to know the man.

1868
01:16:52,090 --> 01:16:52,987
Let's talk.
