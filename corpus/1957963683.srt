of our community,

00:01:56,466 --> 00:01:59,100
we have to understand that
there are consequences

for those actions.

10
00:02:01,337 --> 00:02:03,573

I did not ask for
this responsibility.

I did rise to power

God blessed me with the means

My mother done got it
in her head yesterday

154
00:11:30,573 --> 00:11:31,807
that she wanted to bake a cake

this weekend.

she made a pie,

You know, the one out back
by the outhouse?

them sick to they gut.

from that outhouse

has soaked down to the root

a basic apple can taste.

But Mister Johnson says
that's a bunch of hooey,

165
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:57,732
and because of that, he won't
let Mama have no more apples

for her apple pie, which,
as far as I'm concerned,

167

The sack she has
is full of weevils

182
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:40,385
and she don't think she can
sift them all out this time.

183
00:12:40,409 --> 00:12:41,677
How many pounds?

184
00:12:41,709 --> 00:12:43,679
Just a 20-pound bag'll do.

185
00:12:43,712 --> 00:12:46,148
[footsteps ascend]

186
00:13:02,231 --> 00:13:04,265
[whispering] I didn't, uh,
I didn't see you there.

187
00:13:05,834 --> 00:13:07,370
I wasn't really gonna steal 'em.

188
00:13:07,404 --> 00:13:10,072
It's just a game
I play with your daddy.

189
00:13:10,106 --> 00:13:11,240
[footsteps descend]

190
00:13:13,443 --> 00:13:14,943
Twenty pounds of flour.

191
00:13:14,977 --> 00:13:16,413
That'll be one dollar
and a nickel.

192
00:13:16,446 --> 00:13:18,012
[register dings]

193
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:20,382
Yeah, could you apply it
to my mother's account?

194
00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:23,818
- [Briggs] Of course.
- Thank you, Mister Briggs.

195
00:13:23,852 --> 00:13:25,721
Hope to see you
at the luncheon on Sunday.

196
00:13:26,288 --> 00:13:27,288
Madam.

197
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:32,361
[door opens, closes]

198
00:13:32,395 --> 00:13:33,929
Have you finished
reading your book?

199
00:13:33,962 --> 00:13:37,031
He tried to steal
some jelly beans.

200
00:13:38,867 --> 00:13:40,803
- What?
- [Brooke] That man.

201
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:44,807
Mr. Jeffries?

202
00:13:44,839 --> 00:13:46,376
I caught him taking
some jelly beans

203
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:48,077
and he put them back.

204
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:49,645
He put them back?

205
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,281
He did.

206
00:13:53,316 --> 00:13:56,184
I'll discuss this with him
next time he's in my store.

207
00:14:01,256 --> 00:14:02,957
You want one?

208
00:14:02,991 --> 00:14:03,991
No.

209
00:14:05,294 --> 00:14:06,661
Then what do you want?

210
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:09,932
His hands were dirty.

211
00:14:56,845 --> 00:14:59,148
[jaunty music playing]

212
00:15:50,832 --> 00:15:51,833
[birds chirping]

213
00:16:05,314 --> 00:16:07,416
- [Ruth gasps]
- Pardon me, ma'am.

214
00:16:07,449 --> 00:16:08,983
I didn't mean to frighten you.

215
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:11,986
We weren't sure if
anyone was home.

216
00:16:12,987 --> 00:16:14,957
Someone is home.

217
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:17,025
Me. How can I help you?

218
00:16:17,058 --> 00:16:19,227
Yes, ma'am.

219
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:23,366
First, me apologize for the
rudeness of my introduction.

220
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,266
My name is James McCallister,

221
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,877
and me and my companions
have been on the road

222
00:16:26,901 --> 00:16:28,538
for several days now.

223
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:31,473
We're plum tired and we're
more than a little lost.

224
00:16:33,107 --> 00:16:34,611
"Companions?"

225
00:16:34,644 --> 00:16:36,944
Uh, yes, ma'am.

226
00:16:36,978 --> 00:16:39,415
That's Boots there,
out by the road.

227
00:16:39,448 --> 00:16:42,116
He didn't want to ride up to
the house and frighten folks.

228
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:43,520
He's being polite.

229
00:16:43,553 --> 00:16:47,088
And behind you,
well, that's Big Mike.

230
00:16:47,121 --> 00:16:48,525
Thousand pardons, Miss.

231
00:16:48,558 --> 00:16:50,626
I was just around back
checking to see if

232
00:16:50,659 --> 00:16:52,861
there's anybody in your garden.

233
00:16:52,895 --> 00:16:54,430
Was there?

234
00:16:54,463 --> 00:16:55,464
Nope.

235
00:16:57,265 --> 00:16:59,901
You gentlemen should
have just knocked.

236
00:16:59,934 --> 00:17:01,035
Well, we did knock, ma'am.

237
00:17:01,069 --> 00:17:03,005
Hm, that's true.

238
00:17:03,038 --> 00:17:06,107
Saw Big Mike step up to
that door and give it a rap.

239
00:17:06,141 --> 00:17:08,377
Most definitely witnessed
that with mine own.

240
00:17:09,978 --> 00:17:11,481
Must not have knocked too loud.

241
00:17:11,513 --> 00:17:14,116
I certainly didn't
hear it in the house.

242
00:17:14,148 --> 00:17:16,018
[chuckles]

243
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:18,488
Nevertheless...

244
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,557
Well, if you gentlemen will
just allow me a moment

245
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:22,257
to put the laundry down,

246
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:26,994
I will happily point you
in the direction of town.

247
00:17:27,029 --> 00:17:30,065
It's about a half hour's
walk up the road.

248
00:17:30,098 --> 00:17:32,100
And they've got hotels
and saloons,

249
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:34,436
and a hot bath house
with a brand-new shower.

250
00:17:34,471 --> 00:17:36,472
Well, that would be
an act of kindness, ma'am.

251
00:17:36,506 --> 00:17:38,375
[Big Mike] We'd be much obliged.

252
00:17:38,407 --> 00:17:41,310
My husband will be along
any minute,

253
00:17:41,344 --> 00:17:44,414
so he might even be able to
show you the way himself.

254
00:17:45,615 --> 00:17:47,081
Your husband?

255
00:17:47,116 --> 00:17:48,983
Yes, sir. My husband.

256
00:17:49,017 --> 00:17:51,320
He should be along any moment.

257
00:17:51,354 --> 00:17:52,921
Would your husband
happen to have been

258
00:17:52,954 --> 00:17:56,157
that feller we saw walking
down the road earlier?

259
00:17:56,191 --> 00:17:57,426
Walking with a little girl?

260
00:17:59,395 --> 00:18:02,030
Yes, he was walking
our daughter to school.

261
00:18:02,064 --> 00:18:06,435
[James and Mike laugh]

262
00:18:06,469 --> 00:18:08,103
[James] Oh, ain't
that somethin'?

263
00:18:08,136 --> 00:18:12,341
A grown man walking
a little girl to school.

264
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:14,108
We certainly live in a new age.

265
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:18,012
- Sure does seem like it.
- [James] Sure does.

266
00:18:18,046 --> 00:18:21,584
You said town's about a half
an hour walk up the road?

267
00:18:21,617 --> 00:18:23,485
That's right.

268
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:27,055
Hm. Well...

269
00:18:27,088 --> 00:18:29,090
your man sure been
gone a long time

270
00:18:29,124 --> 00:18:31,324
if he was just walking your
daughter to school and back.

271
00:18:34,564 --> 00:18:36,999
Sure hope nothin' happened
to hold him up.

272
00:18:39,702 --> 00:18:40,737
[grunts]

273
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:42,472
[Ruth screams]

274
00:18:42,504 --> 00:18:44,307
[groans]

275
00:18:47,075 --> 00:18:48,277
Go help him.

276
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:50,244
- [groans]
- You all right?

277
00:18:50,279 --> 00:18:52,013
The bitch kicked me
in the balls.

278
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:54,683
You got your ass whooped by an
unarmed woman doing her laundry.

279
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:57,085
- Yeah.
- You sure you have balls?

280
00:18:57,118 --> 00:19:01,356
[suspenseful music playing]

281
00:19:01,391 --> 00:19:02,524
[pants]

282
00:19:14,068 --> 00:19:16,171
- [knocking]
- Open up, Missy.

283
00:19:16,204 --> 00:19:20,142
I'm coming in
one way or another.

284
00:19:20,174 --> 00:19:22,479
Might as well not
piss us off in the meantime.

285
00:19:22,511 --> 00:19:24,112
[latch clicks]

286
00:19:32,555 --> 00:19:36,023
- [guns cocking]
- [James] Madam...

287
00:19:36,058 --> 00:19:39,462
I think you got the wrong idea
about me and the fellas.

288
00:19:41,396 --> 00:19:44,466
Ain't no sense
runnin' off and hidin'.

289
00:19:44,501 --> 00:19:46,703
We don't want to hurt nobody.

290
00:19:46,735 --> 00:19:48,404
We need to quit peckerin' around

291
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:50,071
and get back on the trail.

292
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:52,608
That marshal can't
be too far behind.

293
00:19:52,642 --> 00:19:55,345
A day, day and a half at most.

294
00:19:55,377 --> 00:19:56,745
We need to keep moving

295
00:19:56,779 --> 00:19:59,080
unless you fools
want to end up back in jail.

296
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:01,483
Eustice, shut your damn mouth.

297
00:20:01,518 --> 00:20:04,520
Now I know you're scared
and you're hiding.

298
00:20:04,553 --> 00:20:06,655
If you'll just
poke your head out,

299
00:20:06,689 --> 00:20:08,357
you'll see we don't
got any guns.

300
00:20:09,526 --> 00:20:10,726
We just want to talk.

301
00:20:13,562 --> 00:20:14,562
[whistles quietly]

302
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:21,370
[neighing]

303
00:20:24,773 --> 00:20:27,075
[suspenseful music]

304
00:20:27,743 --> 00:20:28,744
[gunshot]

305
00:20:28,778 --> 00:20:30,512
[horse whinnies]

306
00:20:35,116 --> 00:20:36,151
[Eustice exclaims]

307
00:20:38,287 --> 00:20:40,356
[James] Go on. Go get her.

308
00:20:40,389 --> 00:20:41,590
Bring her back.

309
00:20:41,624 --> 00:20:43,157
[horse neighs]

310
00:20:43,191 --> 00:20:44,460
[grunts]

311
00:20:45,427 --> 00:20:47,730
[screams]

312
00:20:47,763 --> 00:20:50,264
[grunts]

313
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:55,136
[Ruth pants, grunts]

314
00:20:59,241 --> 00:21:00,643
[grunts]

315
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:05,847
- You gon' live?
- Yeah.

316
00:21:22,331 --> 00:21:24,466
Bring her over! Quickly now!

317
00:21:29,571 --> 00:21:30,772
[groans]

318
00:21:33,809 --> 00:21:35,612
Her arm's all busted up.

319
00:21:35,645 --> 00:21:38,414
That's fine. That's fine.

320
00:21:38,447 --> 00:21:41,584
- [groans]
- [James] I feel like we got off to a bad start.

321
00:21:41,617 --> 00:21:43,752
And I'm going to
put that on you.

322
00:21:43,786 --> 00:21:47,723
Now, when we first met,
I introduced myself, did I not?

323
00:21:47,757 --> 00:21:51,426
I said my name, loud and clear.

324
00:21:51,461 --> 00:21:55,597
You did not do me
the same honor. Did ya'?

325
00:21:57,966 --> 00:22:01,904
I said, did ya'?

326
00:22:01,937 --> 00:22:04,539
You'll get no honor from me.

327
00:22:04,574 --> 00:22:06,208
Tell me this then, huh?

328
00:22:07,476 --> 00:22:11,446
Is this your husband? Hm?

329
00:22:11,481 --> 00:22:14,517
Is he the man we saw walking
down the street this morning?

330
00:22:14,549 --> 00:22:17,686
Is your husband
the Colton Briggs?

331
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,821
Heard of my husband, have you?

332
00:22:19,856 --> 00:22:24,961
[laughs] Oh, I've certainly
heard of your husband.

333
00:22:24,993 --> 00:22:27,229
We're like family, me and him.

334
00:22:27,261 --> 00:22:29,432
Good.

335
00:22:29,464 --> 00:22:32,934
That saves me the trouble
of explaining it to you.

336
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:37,874
You boys are in a world...

337
00:22:38,875 --> 00:22:39,876
of hurt.

338
00:22:41,577 --> 00:22:42,979
Who the shit is Colton Briggs?

339
00:22:43,011 --> 00:22:44,312
[Eustice] Are you serious?

340
00:22:44,347 --> 00:22:46,248
Colton Briggs?

341
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,884
This is Colton Briggs' place?

342
00:22:47,916 --> 00:22:49,519
Eustice, quiet.

343
00:22:49,551 --> 00:22:50,686
That's right.

344
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:54,856
[grunts] And I'm his wife.

345
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:59,362
And you hit me...

346
00:22:59,395 --> 00:23:01,530
in the face with your gun.

347
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,635
Broke my arm.

348
00:23:06,769 --> 00:23:08,870
Shot his horse.

349
00:23:14,042 --> 00:23:17,512
You boys have woke up the devil.

350
00:23:19,615 --> 00:23:22,018
- [laughs]
- [Eustice] God damn it, Jimmy.

351
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:24,420
You bringing hell down on us!

352
00:23:24,453 --> 00:23:28,590
I absolutely
know your husband, hm.

353
00:23:29,959 --> 00:23:31,259
We go way back.

354
00:23:32,395 --> 00:23:35,030
In fact, I owe him a debt.

355
00:23:35,064 --> 00:23:37,767
[tense music building]

356
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:46,908
[Briggs] That'll do.

357
00:23:46,943 --> 00:23:48,510
It's time to head home.

358
00:23:52,013 --> 00:23:54,483
Mama didn't come
to get me from school.

359
00:23:54,517 --> 00:23:57,019
You weren't at school.
You were here.

360
00:23:57,052 --> 00:23:58,721
Yes, but wouldn't she
come here to find me

361
00:23:58,754 --> 00:24:00,455
if I wasn't at school?

362
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:03,326
[ominous music playing]

363
00:24:06,863 --> 00:24:08,296
[door opens]

364
00:24:17,373 --> 00:24:18,883
- [horses neigh]
- [Deputy] Hey, Marshal!

365
00:24:18,907 --> 00:24:20,742
You better come on out here.

366
00:24:27,517 --> 00:24:29,618
Who are those men?

367
00:24:29,652 --> 00:24:31,921
[Marshal] What do we got here?
The family?

368
00:24:31,953 --> 00:24:33,598
Maybe it looks like
the father and the daughter

369
00:24:33,623 --> 00:24:35,289
from that picture
on the mantle in there.

370
00:24:41,062 --> 00:24:44,066
[Marshal] They must've been away
when those fellas came through.

371
00:24:44,099 --> 00:24:46,068
Thank God they're okay.

372
00:24:46,102 --> 00:24:47,869
A little bit of luck, finally.

373
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:51,440
Lucky, indeed.

374
00:24:54,143 --> 00:24:55,811
Tell the others to come outside.

375
00:24:55,845 --> 00:24:57,455
We shouldn't be making
ourselves comfortable

376
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,513
in these folks' home.

377
00:25:04,619 --> 00:25:06,087
[Deputy] Hey, you guys...

378
00:25:06,122 --> 00:25:08,124
family's here.

379
00:25:08,156 --> 00:25:09,959
- They're still alive?
- Yup.

380
00:25:12,127 --> 00:25:13,796
Oh, shit.

381
00:25:16,132 --> 00:25:18,835
- [horse neighs]
- This you folks home?

382
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:26,075
I want to apologize for my men.

383
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:29,779
We, uh, we didn't realize that
no one was home and...

384
00:25:29,811 --> 00:25:30,980
My wife was home.

385
00:25:34,116 --> 00:25:36,519
Yes, sir. l... uh...

386
00:25:36,551 --> 00:25:39,387
I apologize again.

387
00:25:39,422 --> 00:25:41,490
My name is US Marshall
Franklin Jarrett.

388
00:25:41,523 --> 00:25:42,758
I know who you are.

389
00:25:43,826 --> 00:25:44,993
Where's Ruth?

390
00:25:48,664 --> 00:25:50,832
I'm afraid you have me
at a loss, sir.

391
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,135
Do I know you?

392
00:26:00,443 --> 00:26:01,577
Briggs?

393
00:26:04,946 --> 00:26:06,581
Well holy shit, man.

394
00:26:07,183 --> 00:26:08,183
I, uh...

395
00:26:10,786 --> 00:26:12,922
I apologize, little lady.

396
00:26:12,954 --> 00:26:14,924
That language is, uh,
not appropriate.

397
00:26:18,027 --> 00:26:19,761
You have a family?

398
00:26:25,201 --> 00:26:28,471
Well, that is a good thing.

399
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:33,142
A man needs a family.
It, uh, grounds him.

400
00:26:33,174 --> 00:26:35,543
Evens him out.
That is... this is good.

401
00:26:35,578 --> 00:26:37,480
Marshal...

402
00:26:45,788 --> 00:26:47,522
I'm sorry, Briggs, but...

403
00:26:48,991 --> 00:26:50,091
we need to talk.

404
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:55,164
Somewhere private, preferably.

405
00:26:55,196 --> 00:26:58,166
[somber music playing]

406
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:06,107
Why don't you boys go
help him dig that hole?

407
00:27:07,609 --> 00:27:09,177
Says he don't want our help.

408
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:11,146
Says we should've been
better at our jobs.

409
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:13,049
[Jarrett] He ain't wrong.

410
00:27:13,081 --> 00:27:15,550
- Go get them horses ready.
- Hmm.

411
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:17,118
[shovel hitting dirt]

412
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:28,129
Little lady...

413
00:27:28,164 --> 00:27:31,133
I had Smiley heat up
some of that condensed milk

414
00:27:31,166 --> 00:27:32,835
and put a little
brown sugar in it.

415
00:27:32,867 --> 00:27:34,936
It's good. Make you feel better.

416
00:27:48,783 --> 00:27:50,685
I never knew your mama.

417
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:54,022
But I know she was a good woman.

418
00:27:56,192 --> 00:27:57,660
But I did know your daddy.

419
00:27:59,295 --> 00:28:01,062
Years and years ago.

420
00:28:02,964 --> 00:28:05,067
You meet a lot of people
in this business,

421
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:08,303
and the faces, a lot of times,
just disappear over the years.

422
00:28:08,337 --> 00:28:11,639
But not your daddy.

423
00:28:11,674 --> 00:28:14,276
[chuckles] No, sir. Not him.

424
00:28:16,811 --> 00:28:18,213
Your daddy was about

425
00:28:18,247 --> 00:28:21,783
the meanest son of a bitch
I ever met.

426
00:28:21,817 --> 00:28:24,052
Pardon my language, but...

427
00:28:24,086 --> 00:28:26,087
I never met anybody like him.

428
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:30,026
Just the way he would
look at you, just...

429
00:28:32,161 --> 00:28:34,096
like he was looking through you.

430
00:28:35,697 --> 00:28:37,266
Like you were nothing.

431
00:28:41,337 --> 00:28:42,937
And I don't say this lightly,

432
00:28:42,972 --> 00:28:46,942
but y... your daddy
was a violent man.

433
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:49,346
I've seen him shoot
three cowboys one time.

434
00:28:49,378 --> 00:28:51,079
Now it was a fair fight, but...

435
00:28:51,113 --> 00:28:54,116
I don't think his blood
raised an ounce.

436
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:56,051
I can't say he was a criminal.

437
00:28:56,085 --> 00:29:00,222
I don't know that,
but I can say that he...

438
00:29:00,256 --> 00:29:02,625
was not what I would
call a "good man."

439
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,661
Not back then.

440
00:29:07,629 --> 00:29:09,097
Why are you telling me this?

441
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:12,666
Hm.

442
00:29:17,807 --> 00:29:20,142
I guess I just want you
to understand...

443
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:24,145
how good a woman your mama was.

444
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:28,283
She took the coldest killer
that I've ever met,

445
00:29:28,318 --> 00:29:30,920
and she turned him
into a family man.

446
00:29:30,953 --> 00:29:33,254
Minding a store.

447
00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:37,058
Raising a little lady.

448
00:29:37,093 --> 00:29:39,228
That was a good thing
your mama done.

449
00:29:41,062 --> 00:29:42,998
My father used to kill people?

450
00:29:43,832 --> 00:29:45,701
Yeah.

451
00:29:45,733 --> 00:29:47,337
But that was years ago.

452
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:51,807
I haven't even seen
my father hold a gun.

453
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,876
And that's because
he's a good man now.

454
00:29:55,311 --> 00:29:57,078
Because of what your mama done.

455
00:30:00,014 --> 00:30:01,616
You carry a gun.

456
00:30:02,718 --> 00:30:03,985
Are you a good man?

457
00:30:05,721 --> 00:30:06,989
I try to be.

458
00:30:08,124 --> 00:30:10,024
My mama's dead now.

459
00:30:13,796 --> 00:30:15,830
Is my father still a good man?

460
00:30:18,968 --> 00:30:23,172
[somber music playing]

461
00:30:34,149 --> 00:30:36,285
Would you like for me
to say a few words?

462
00:30:36,318 --> 00:30:38,721
You said plenty of words.

463
00:30:38,753 --> 00:30:39,989
None of them helped.

464
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,329
There's something
you should know.

465
00:30:47,364 --> 00:30:51,733
Um, them fellas left
a mess in your barn.

466
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:55,905
Not something your
little girl should see.

467
00:30:55,937 --> 00:31:00,910
You'll wanna clean that up
before you let her go in there.

468
00:31:00,943 --> 00:31:02,845
I reckon we'll be
hitting the trail.

469
00:31:02,877 --> 00:31:05,414
I figured we're only
a few hours behind 'em.

470
00:31:05,447 --> 00:31:08,451
And I think I've got a pretty
good idea where they're going.

471
00:31:08,484 --> 00:31:11,320
Tell me the names of
the men who did this.

472
00:31:11,354 --> 00:31:13,155
Tell me where they're going.

473
00:31:15,357 --> 00:31:16,459
No, sir.

474
00:31:16,492 --> 00:31:18,827
I don't think I can do that.

475
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:22,432
I reckon it's been
a few years since the world

476
00:31:22,464 --> 00:31:24,334
has seen the old Colton Briggs

477
00:31:24,366 --> 00:31:26,268
and I think the world
is probably pretty happy

478
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:28,203
leaving that just
right where it is.

479
00:31:28,237 --> 00:31:29,805
Tell me the names of the men

480
00:31:29,837 --> 00:31:31,839
responsible for
the death of my wife.

481
00:31:31,874 --> 00:31:33,876
[Jarrett]
Briggs, listen to yourself.

482
00:31:33,908 --> 00:31:35,844
You see that
little girl over there?

483
00:31:35,877 --> 00:31:37,745
She just lost her mama.

484
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:41,216
She needs her father now.

485
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:44,386
Whatever changes happened to
you that that woman gave you,

486
00:31:44,421 --> 00:31:46,187
don't let 'em die with her.

487
00:31:46,222 --> 00:31:50,960
That little girl needs the man
that she knows and loves.

488
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:54,396
You know, ever since
we were granted statehood,

489
00:31:54,431 --> 00:31:58,401
this here land is now
part of a new country.

490
00:31:58,434 --> 00:32:02,405
We got laws. We got due process.

491
00:32:02,439 --> 00:32:05,308
Folks just don't go around
killin' other folks.

492
00:32:05,341 --> 00:32:08,277
That ain't the world anymore.

493
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:09,979
Keep right by your daughter.

494
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:13,115
Keep right by God.

495
00:32:13,147 --> 00:32:17,252
I will find those
murderous sons of bitches.

496
00:32:17,286 --> 00:32:20,490
I will catch 'em.
We will take them to trial,

497
00:32:20,522 --> 00:32:22,090
and they will hang.

498
00:32:22,124 --> 00:32:23,492
I promise that to you.

499
00:32:25,126 --> 00:32:26,895
Take care of your daughter.

500
00:32:26,928 --> 00:32:29,499
As long as that
little girl is alive,

501
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:33,969
there's no room for
vengeance in your life.

502
00:32:55,156 --> 00:32:56,459
What do we do now?

503
00:32:56,492 --> 00:32:57,859
[Briggs] Go to bed.

[grunts]

518
00:35:58,475 --> 00:35:59,709
[Briggs] Get dressed.

519
00:35:59,741 --> 00:36:01,477
Those are pants.

520
00:36:01,511 --> 00:36:04,481
No dresses.
We leave in 15 minutes.

521
00:36:12,522 --> 00:36:13,790
[Brooke] This is Mama's horse.

522
00:36:13,823 --> 00:36:15,624
[Briggs] Yeah. They killed mine.

523
00:36:15,658 --> 00:36:18,327
We'll have to travel light.

524
00:36:18,361 --> 00:36:20,229
She can't run with both of us.

525
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:21,607
If we're gonna catch up
with those men,

526
00:36:21,631 --> 00:36:23,265
we're gonna need another horse.

527
00:36:23,298 --> 00:36:25,100
Yeah. We'll find one
along the way.

528
00:36:33,709 --> 00:36:35,410

[birds chirp]

531
00:37:02,405 --> 00:37:04,439
[Brooke] This is a good time
for us to do this.

532
00:37:04,473 --> 00:37:06,341
My teacher at school is sick.

533
00:37:06,376 --> 00:37:08,276
If it's pox, she could
be sick for days.

534
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:09,345
She could die.

535
00:37:09,379 --> 00:37:11,814
They'll get a new teacher.

536
00:37:11,848 --> 00:37:14,616
I forgot my school books.

537
00:37:14,651 --> 00:37:17,160
- I think they burned up in the fire.
- [Briggs] We'll get new books.

538
00:37:17,185 --> 00:37:19,263
- [Brooke] What about my clothes?
- [Briggs] We'll get new clothes.

539
00:37:19,287 --> 00:37:20,632
[Brooke] Why did we
burn the old ones?

540
00:37:20,656 --> 00:37:22,156
Because we're not going back!

541
00:37:24,493 --> 00:37:26,194
We're not going back.

542
00:37:27,729 --> 00:37:29,631
As soon as I finish
what I have to do,

543
00:37:29,665 --> 00:37:32,200
we'll find a new place and...

544
00:37:32,234 --> 00:37:33,736
we'll replace
everything you lost.

545
00:37:35,772 --> 00:37:37,171
Except Mama.

546
00:37:40,577 --> 00:37:42,778
[dramatic music playing]

547
00:37:52,522 --> 00:37:53,756
Give me the belt.

548
00:37:56,491 --> 00:37:57,627
You gonna whoop me?

549
00:38:11,341 --> 00:38:12,542
Take that.

550
00:38:13,943 --> 00:38:16,613
Over there by that tree,
off the path.

551
00:38:16,645 --> 00:38:18,915
You can sleep for 30 minutes,
not longer.

552
00:38:18,948 --> 00:38:21,484
Then we'll eat,
and we'll get back on trail.

553
00:38:21,517 --> 00:38:24,151
We'll do that every four hours
until we catch 'em.

554
00:38:24,185 --> 00:38:26,823
Aren't those men
getting further away?

555
00:38:26,856 --> 00:38:28,591
They're only men.
They need sleep as well.

556
00:38:28,624 --> 00:38:29,892
They'll wait for us.

557
00:38:29,926 --> 00:38:31,861
But if we keep going,
we can be there sooner,

558
00:38:31,894 --> 00:38:35,832
- before anything...
- Won't do us no good if we get there dead tired.

559
00:38:35,865 --> 00:38:38,635
Or if our horse
dies from exhaustion.

560
00:38:38,667 --> 00:38:41,303
It's not enough
that we find these men.

561
00:38:41,336 --> 00:38:43,906
We need to be ready to kill 'em.

562
00:38:43,939 --> 00:38:45,741
Because they'll be
meaning to kill us.

563
00:38:47,443 --> 00:38:48,611
[sighs]

564
00:38:51,613 --> 00:38:53,915
[foreboding music playing]

565
00:38:58,754 --> 00:39:04,761
[adventurous music playing]

566
00:39:04,794 --> 00:39:09,399
[horses neighing]

567
00:39:12,769 --> 00:39:14,569
Did that seem strange to you?

568
00:39:14,604 --> 00:39:16,203
That little girl last night?

569
00:39:17,506 --> 00:39:19,441
How do you mean?

570
00:39:19,475 --> 00:39:21,843
Her mama had just been killed.

571
00:39:21,877 --> 00:39:24,747
She was sittin' there right
next to the body.

572
00:39:24,781 --> 00:39:26,381
Not a tear on her face.

573
00:39:28,517 --> 00:39:30,386
Hell, I never even
met the woman.

574
00:39:30,419 --> 00:39:34,490
I cried more about it
than her own daughter.

575
00:39:34,524 --> 00:39:36,892
Well, she's probably just
shocked from the news.

576
00:39:36,926 --> 00:39:39,461
I mean, her mama was just killed.
She ain't never coming back.

577
00:39:39,495 --> 00:39:42,832
Gotta be hard for any
youngster to understand.

578
00:39:44,533 --> 00:39:45,868
I suppose so.

579
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:48,705
[gunshot]

580
00:39:48,738 --> 00:39:50,606
[horse neighs]

581
00:39:51,607 --> 00:39:53,542
Holy shit!

582
00:39:53,575 --> 00:39:55,778
- [gun fires]
- [horses neigh]

583
00:39:55,812 --> 00:39:56,778
Come on. Come on. Come on.

584
00:39:56,812 --> 00:40:01,283
[gunshots continue]

585
00:40:08,024 --> 00:40:09,959
Holy shit, son.

586
00:40:09,991 --> 00:40:11,993
How'd you do that?

587
00:40:15,897 --> 00:40:16,897
[grunts]

588
00:40:19,001 --> 00:40:20,836
My leg is busted.

589
00:40:32,314 --> 00:40:34,350
That one's a shooter, shit.

590
00:40:34,383 --> 00:40:36,051
It's that marshal.

591
00:40:36,084 --> 00:40:37,586
You didn't shoot the marshal?

592
00:40:46,095 --> 00:40:47,830
God damn it!

593
00:40:47,863 --> 00:40:50,074
That asshole started the ambush
before we're in position!

594
00:40:50,098 --> 00:40:52,834
[gunshots continue]

595
00:40:52,868 --> 00:40:54,803
[horse neighs]

596
00:40:58,673 --> 00:40:59,808
What do we do?

597
00:40:59,841 --> 00:41:01,611
Do you see Briggs?

598
00:41:01,644 --> 00:41:03,363
Shit, boss, I don't know
what he looks like.

599
00:41:04,781 --> 00:41:06,381
Oh, you'll know
when you see him.

600
00:41:06,415 --> 00:41:07,582
I promise you that.

601
00:41:20,562 --> 00:41:22,598
Get down, Smiley!

602
00:41:22,631 --> 00:41:23,999
- Oh!
- [chuckles]

603
00:41:24,033 --> 00:41:25,600
Dumbass.

604
00:41:25,635 --> 00:41:27,403
Let's see how far
them bastards get now.

605
00:41:30,772 --> 00:41:32,542
Boss is pulling out.

606
00:41:32,575 --> 00:41:35,011
Next reload,
let's get up that hill.

607
00:41:35,044 --> 00:41:37,013
[gunshots continue]

608
00:41:39,147 --> 00:41:40,682
I'm out of here!

609
00:41:44,053 --> 00:41:46,122
[gun cocking]

610
00:41:46,155 --> 00:41:47,723
God help us.

611
00:41:53,995 --> 00:41:55,031
[twig snaps]

612
00:41:56,598 --> 00:41:57,834
[gasps]

613
00:42:02,437 --> 00:42:03,839
Is it time to leave?

614
00:42:03,872 --> 00:42:07,709
I heard gunshots coming
from across the canyon.

615
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:09,912
- When?
- [Briggs] Ten minutes ago.

616
00:42:09,946 --> 00:42:11,347
Why didn't you wake me?

617
00:42:12,582 --> 00:42:15,017
No reason to hurry.

618
00:42:15,051 --> 00:42:19,622
Gunshots might have a way of
speeding some folks up, but...

619
00:42:19,655 --> 00:42:23,593
they have a nasty habit of
slowing other folks down.

620
00:42:27,964 --> 00:42:29,832
We'll find out what
happened soon enough.

621
00:42:29,865 --> 00:42:30,899
Either way.

622
00:42:35,872 --> 00:42:37,039
[James] I can't believe you.

623
00:42:37,073 --> 00:42:38,941
[grunts]

624
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:41,410
You want to tell me what
the hell just happened? Huh?

625
00:42:41,444 --> 00:42:43,044
What the hell, boss?

626
00:42:43,078 --> 00:42:45,615
Those guys up front, they were
about to go behind the hill.

627
00:42:45,647 --> 00:42:47,115
I wouldn't have
seen 'em if I waited.

628
00:42:47,149 --> 00:42:50,785
You were supposed to shoot
the Marshal first. Huh?

629
00:42:50,819 --> 00:42:53,488
Instead, genius here decides to
shoot the first guy he sees,

630
00:42:53,522 --> 00:42:56,758
chasing everybody, including
the marshal, into cover.

631
00:42:56,792 --> 00:42:57,926
You know...

632
00:42:57,959 --> 00:42:59,662
I go to enormous pains

633
00:42:59,694 --> 00:43:01,696
to invite Colton Briggs
to come find me.

634
00:43:01,731 --> 00:43:04,700
You go ahead and leave a perfectly
healthy lawman between us.

635
00:43:04,734 --> 00:43:06,736
It's like you're trying
to work against me.

636
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:11,439
Is that what's
happening here? Huh?

637
00:43:11,473 --> 00:43:12,908
You're working against me?

638
00:43:17,113 --> 00:43:18,446
Nah, boss.

639
00:43:19,482 --> 00:43:21,450
I'm with you.

640
00:43:21,484 --> 00:43:23,586
I just messed up. That's all.

641
00:43:23,618 --> 00:43:26,488
I certainly hope so.

642
00:43:26,522 --> 00:43:27,957
Because if that
lawman stops Briggs

643
00:43:27,990 --> 00:43:29,091
before he can get to me...

644
00:43:30,792 --> 00:43:32,495
there will be hell to pay.

645
00:43:32,528 --> 00:43:33,995
Mm.

646
00:43:34,030 --> 00:43:35,798
[Eustice] It don't
matter for nothing.

647
00:43:38,267 --> 00:43:40,202
You got somethin' to say,
old man?

648
00:43:40,236 --> 00:43:42,837
If Colton Briggs
decides he's coming,

649
00:43:42,872 --> 00:43:45,073
you might as well set
an extra plate at the table

650
00:43:46,207 --> 00:43:47,977
because Colton Briggs is coming.

651
00:44:01,189 --> 00:44:02,857
What's going on?

652
00:44:02,892 --> 00:44:04,459
There's a rider coming.

653
00:44:05,627 --> 00:44:07,595
One of the men who killed Mama?

654
00:44:09,698 --> 00:44:11,734
Maybe one of the men
from the posse?

655
00:44:11,767 --> 00:44:14,202
Either way, we need his horse.

656
00:44:14,236 --> 00:44:16,638
- Are you gonna kill him?
- I'm gonna take his horse.

657
00:44:16,671 --> 00:44:18,506
Chances are, he won't
like me doing that.

658
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:20,285
I don't think Mama would
like you killin' no lawman.

659
00:44:20,310 --> 00:44:22,711
I don't know if he is a lawman.

660
00:44:22,745 --> 00:44:25,180
Chances are he won't stop
and give me time to ask.

661
00:44:27,316 --> 00:44:29,517
Can't you think of
another way to stop him?

662
00:44:42,732 --> 00:44:44,075
He'll be coming from
that direction.

663
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:45,868
You stand there
and get him to stop.

664
00:44:46,635 --> 00:44:47,836
How?

665
00:44:47,870 --> 00:44:50,272
Cry. Make him
feel sorry for you.

666
00:44:53,109 --> 00:44:54,810
I don't know how.

667
00:44:54,843 --> 00:44:56,178
[sighs]

668
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:00,281
What did you just say?

669
00:45:02,852 --> 00:45:04,519
I don't know how to cry.

670
00:45:06,988 --> 00:45:09,591
Now, you listen to me.

671
00:45:09,624 --> 00:45:12,627
People in this world
expect you to act like they do.

672
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:14,662
They expect you to laugh
at their jokes,

673
00:45:14,696 --> 00:45:17,232
and sigh at their babies,
and cry at their funerals.

674
00:45:17,265 --> 00:45:19,001
And if you can't learn
to do those things,

675
00:45:19,035 --> 00:45:20,970
they won't accept you.
They'll push you out.

676
00:45:21,002 --> 00:45:22,937
Now, do you wanna
make it in this world?

677
00:45:22,972 --> 00:45:26,142
Answer me! Do you wanna fit in?

678
00:45:26,174 --> 00:45:28,455
Then you're going to have
figure out how to act like them.

679
00:45:30,178 --> 00:45:32,915
You remember last summer when
the parson's daughter died?

680
00:45:32,948 --> 00:45:34,749
You remember how his wife cried?

681
00:45:34,783 --> 00:45:36,285
Wahh wahh!

682
00:45:37,086 --> 00:45:38,254
Wahh wahh!

683
00:45:38,287 --> 00:45:39,754
A little louder. Wahh wahh!

684
00:45:39,789 --> 00:45:41,057
My baby! My baby!

685
00:45:41,089 --> 00:45:43,859
Wahh wahh! My baby! My baby!

686
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:46,662
That'll have to do. Keep it up.

687
00:45:51,066 --> 00:45:54,970
Wahh wahh! Wahh wahh!

688
00:45:55,004 --> 00:45:56,939
Wahh wahh!

689
00:45:56,972 --> 00:45:58,240
You okay, little girl?

690
00:45:58,274 --> 00:46:01,042
Wahh! My baby! My baby! Wahh!

691
00:46:01,077 --> 00:46:03,044
Baby? What baby?
What? What are you getting at?

692
00:46:03,078 --> 00:46:04,381
- Wahh!
- [gun cocks]

693
00:46:04,414 --> 00:46:06,048
You're gettin' off that horse.

694
00:46:07,917 --> 00:46:09,051
[horse snorts]

695
00:46:10,718 --> 00:46:11,959
You should have gone with Mark.

696
00:46:11,986 --> 00:46:14,790
[grunts] He looked pretty bad.

697
00:46:14,823 --> 00:46:17,959
And what? Leave you two
here without protection?

698
00:46:17,993 --> 00:46:20,028
I ain't helpless.

699
00:46:20,062 --> 00:46:22,698
Don't shoot. Don't shoot.
It's me.

700
00:46:22,731 --> 00:46:24,200
Shit, Mark.

701
00:46:24,232 --> 00:46:26,868
You scared the hell out of us.

702
00:46:26,901 --> 00:46:28,405
What the hell are you
doing back here?

703
00:46:28,437 --> 00:46:29,872
Where's your horse?

704
00:46:30,738 --> 00:46:31,774
Ask them.

705
00:46:31,807 --> 00:46:33,676
- [gun cocks]
- What the hell?!

706
00:46:36,178 --> 00:46:37,245
[Mark] I'm sorry, guys.

707
00:46:39,381 --> 00:46:41,149
Now, Briggs,

708
00:46:41,182 --> 00:46:43,752
I know you're upset.
Hell, I don't blame you.

709
00:46:43,785 --> 00:46:45,187
But whatever
you think you're doing,

710
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:46,988
you need to let these boys go.

711
00:46:48,790 --> 00:46:50,658
Fetch that Rossi
and bring it here.

712
00:46:54,162 --> 00:46:56,165
My father wants your shotgun.

713
00:46:57,466 --> 00:46:59,100
Do what she says, Greg.

714
00:47:01,337 --> 00:47:04,939
I will blow this little girl's
brains all over this valley.

715
00:47:09,077 --> 00:47:10,278
Do you hear me?

716
00:47:12,848 --> 00:47:16,785
I said I will blow her brains
all over this valley.

717
00:47:16,819 --> 00:47:18,421
I'll pull the trigger right now!

718
00:47:18,455 --> 00:47:20,256
[screams]

719
00:47:20,289 --> 00:47:22,790
[groans]

720
00:47:28,330 --> 00:47:30,265
[grunting]

721
00:47:30,298 --> 00:47:32,033
He cries pretty good.

722
00:47:32,834 --> 00:47:35,236
[grunts]

723
00:47:35,270 --> 00:47:37,339
I'm gonna try and do it
like him next time.

724
00:47:39,841 --> 00:47:41,944
Both of you put your hands
behind your back.

725
00:47:50,185 --> 00:47:51,754
Is this enough wood?

726
00:47:51,787 --> 00:47:54,857
That wood's too green.
It needs to burn hotter.

727
00:47:54,890 --> 00:47:56,991
See the tip of that?

728
00:47:57,026 --> 00:47:59,028
Should burn so hot it glows red.

729
00:47:59,060 --> 00:48:00,129
Fetch dry wood.

730
00:48:00,162 --> 00:48:02,263
It burns hotter.
It burns faster.

731
00:48:13,343 --> 00:48:14,910
Listen to me, Briggs.

732
00:48:14,944 --> 00:48:16,412
Just listen to me.

733
00:48:16,446 --> 00:48:19,982
Up till now, you haven't
committed any crimes

734
00:48:20,015 --> 00:48:21,484
that you can't walk away from.

735
00:48:23,819 --> 00:48:26,087
I understand that you're
under a lot of pressure,

736
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:28,189
pain of losing your wife.

737
00:48:28,223 --> 00:48:29,758
I can't imagine it.

738
00:48:29,792 --> 00:48:31,493
Any man might have done
the same thing.

739
00:48:31,528 --> 00:48:34,763
Made some of the same
decisions that you've made.

740
00:48:34,796 --> 00:48:36,265
But you are about to
cross a line

741
00:48:36,298 --> 00:48:38,133
that you can't get back from.

742
00:48:38,167 --> 00:48:41,370
Assaulting a US Marshal,

743
00:48:41,403 --> 00:48:43,305
murdering a US Marshal,

744
00:48:43,339 --> 00:48:46,841
that is trouble that you have
not encountered before.

745
00:48:48,944 --> 00:48:50,513
Are you sure about that?

746
00:48:55,883 --> 00:48:57,453
What about your daughter,
Briggs?

747
00:48:57,486 --> 00:49:00,390
You're making her an accessory.

748
00:49:00,423 --> 00:49:02,524
These men here need
medical attention

749
00:49:02,558 --> 00:49:04,201
and you are preventing
them from getting it.

750
00:49:04,225 --> 00:49:06,562
No. You are.

751
00:49:06,595 --> 00:49:08,897
By not telling me
what I want to know.

752
00:49:08,930 --> 00:49:10,332
I'm a federal marshal.

753
00:49:10,366 --> 00:49:12,334
You're asking me to
participate in murder.

754
00:49:12,368 --> 00:49:13,935
You're protecting a killer.

755
00:49:13,968 --> 00:49:15,270
From another killer.

756
00:49:17,872 --> 00:49:18,906
Correct.

757
00:49:25,448 --> 00:49:26,848
Is this dry enough?

758
00:49:26,881 --> 00:49:28,883
Good. Put it on the fire.

759
00:49:28,917 --> 00:49:30,419
We'll be ready to start soon.

760
00:49:33,423 --> 00:49:36,225
If anything happens to my men,
I swear to God,

761
00:49:36,258 --> 00:49:38,993
I will hunt you down
and I will kill you myself.

762
00:49:40,397 --> 00:49:42,531
[foreboding music playing]

763
00:49:44,866 --> 00:49:47,537
Like you hunted down the
man who killed my wife?

764
00:49:47,569 --> 00:49:49,837
The man who killed your men?

765
00:49:49,872 --> 00:49:53,241
The man responsible for
everything happening right now?

766
00:49:55,910 --> 00:49:57,546
I'll take my chances.

767
00:49:57,580 --> 00:49:58,580
Rip his shirt.

768
00:49:58,615 --> 00:50:00,582
Don't you touch me!

769
00:50:00,616 --> 00:50:02,551
Give him the stick
like I showed you.

770
00:50:05,287 --> 00:50:07,457
- Please... stop... [screams]
- James McCallister!

771
00:50:10,660 --> 00:50:14,229
Name's James McCallister.
He rides with three men,

772
00:50:14,263 --> 00:50:17,600
Michael Orleans and Boots Miller
and Eustice Bedford.

773
00:50:17,633 --> 00:50:19,502
They're all hardened criminals.

774
00:50:19,535 --> 00:50:21,903
Word is, he promised them
a share of a lockbox

775
00:50:21,937 --> 00:50:24,039
he's got stashed somewhere
if they'd bust him out of

776
00:50:24,073 --> 00:50:25,475
the prison in Powell County.

777
00:50:25,508 --> 00:50:27,377
And they're headed to Colorado.

778
00:50:27,410 --> 00:50:30,144
Somebody told me he's got a
little Mexican girl down there

779
00:50:30,178 --> 00:50:32,381
in a town he likes
called Santa Rosa.

780
00:50:32,415 --> 00:50:35,017
The trail I was on meant that
he was headed that way.

781
00:50:35,049 --> 00:50:37,919
And that's all I know
about it. I swear it.

782
00:50:39,555 --> 00:50:40,656
Hold him.

783
00:50:40,689 --> 00:50:43,024
- No, no.
- Oh, you son of a bitch!

784
00:50:43,057 --> 00:50:45,627
- [screams]
- I will kill you, you son of a bitch!

785
00:50:45,662 --> 00:50:47,129
[screams]

786
00:50:50,466 --> 00:50:52,535
[bullet clangs]

787
00:50:52,569 --> 00:50:54,002
Bring me the iron.

788
00:50:58,441 --> 00:51:02,345
Pinch the flesh on each side of
the wound and push it together.

789
00:51:02,379 --> 00:51:04,979
We have to burn it with the iron

790
00:51:05,013 --> 00:51:06,682
or he'll bleed out soon.

791
00:51:06,716 --> 00:51:08,283
[flesh searing]

792
00:51:11,053 --> 00:51:12,622
Smells like Mama's rabbit chops.

793
00:51:12,655 --> 00:51:14,923
Mm, that's the whiskey.

794
00:51:17,727 --> 00:51:19,194
Makes me hungry.

795
00:51:19,227 --> 00:51:20,261
Mm-hmm.

796
00:51:22,564 --> 00:51:23,564
[bullet clattering]

797
00:51:25,667 --> 00:51:27,236
The bullet was poisoning him.

798
00:51:27,269 --> 00:51:29,406
He's got a chance now.

799
00:51:29,439 --> 00:51:32,240
But these men are not
walking out of this canyon.

800
00:51:34,711 --> 00:51:36,944
If get to Santa Rosa...

801
00:51:36,979 --> 00:51:39,682
and there's
no James McCallister,

802
00:51:39,716 --> 00:51:42,352
no Mexican girl,
no gang of four,

803
00:51:42,385 --> 00:51:44,653
I will come back here
and I will kill these two men

804
00:51:44,687 --> 00:51:47,955
before you can return with help.

805
00:51:47,990 --> 00:51:50,158
And then, I will wait for you.

806
00:51:50,191 --> 00:51:52,562
And no matter how many men
you bring back with you,

807
00:51:52,595 --> 00:51:54,129
I will kill you first.

808
00:51:54,162 --> 00:51:56,399
I will kill you...

809
00:51:56,432 --> 00:51:58,435
before you even see me.

810
00:52:00,035 --> 00:52:01,437
Do you understand?

811
00:52:04,406 --> 00:52:07,544
We're taking your guns
and your horse.

812
00:52:07,577 --> 00:52:09,412
You gotta leave me
a horse, Briggs!

813
00:52:09,446 --> 00:52:12,649
- You can't take my horse!
- Take your mother's horse.

814
00:52:12,682 --> 00:52:15,417
- This one suits me fine.
- Damn it, don't question me.

815
00:52:15,452 --> 00:52:17,261
You've got more experience
with your mother's horse.

816
00:52:17,285 --> 00:52:18,655
She knows you. Fewer surprises.

817
00:52:18,687 --> 00:52:19,689
Now get up.

818
00:52:19,722 --> 00:52:21,189
[horse snorts]

819
00:52:31,066 --> 00:52:33,736
[somber music]

820
00:52:43,077 --> 00:52:45,647
I'll leave your horse
tied up in Santa Rosa.

821
00:52:45,682 --> 00:52:47,149
I'm no horse thief.

822
00:52:47,182 --> 00:52:50,151
Justice is gonna
find you, Briggs.

823
00:52:50,185 --> 00:52:54,122
- H'yah!
- You hear me? God damn you.

824
00:52:54,156 --> 00:52:56,225
Justice will catch you!

825
00:53:33,127 --> 00:53:34,196
[James] There.

826
00:53:34,229 --> 00:53:35,765
Just like I told you boys.

827
00:53:35,798 --> 00:53:37,834
[Eustice] Let's crack her open
and see what we got.

828
00:53:37,866 --> 00:53:40,202
[creaking]

829
00:53:41,537 --> 00:53:42,839
Oh, lordy.

830
00:53:42,872 --> 00:53:45,341
[laughing] Whoo-hoo!

831
00:53:49,745 --> 00:53:54,149
<i>"El Banco Londres Y Mexico"?</i>

832
00:53:54,182 --> 00:53:55,618
What the hell?

833
00:53:55,651 --> 00:53:56,785
Now settle down.

834
00:53:57,854 --> 00:53:59,321
What the hell, boss?

835
00:53:59,354 --> 00:54:01,423
Where's the money, boss?

836
00:54:01,457 --> 00:54:04,761
Now, if I was crossing you,

837
00:54:04,794 --> 00:54:06,194
I would have killed you already.

838
00:54:06,227 --> 00:54:07,763
But I didn't.

839
00:54:09,899 --> 00:54:12,334
Nothing but a dirty rat...

840
00:54:13,403 --> 00:54:14,671
[grumbles]

841
00:54:14,703 --> 00:54:16,472
You ain't too bright now,
is you?

842
00:54:16,506 --> 00:54:18,173
But that's okay.
That's why you got me.

843
00:54:18,205 --> 00:54:19,709
I got brains.

844
00:54:19,741 --> 00:54:22,377
And my brains know that since
we busted out of jail,

845
00:54:22,412 --> 00:54:23,788
we're gonna have to
lay low for a while.

846
00:54:23,812 --> 00:54:25,814
At least a year or so.

847
00:54:25,848 --> 00:54:27,783
Any of you boys got any idea
what kind of money

848
00:54:27,816 --> 00:54:29,819
they spend down in Mexico? Hm?

849
00:54:30,852 --> 00:54:32,522
Right there,

850
00:54:32,555 --> 00:54:33,865
that's enough <i>dinero</i>
for each of us

851
00:54:33,890 --> 00:54:36,392
to live like kings
for as long as we need.

852
00:54:36,426 --> 00:54:38,528
Each of you get an equal share,

853
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:41,229
hm, as long as
you stick with me.

854
00:54:41,263 --> 00:54:44,834
Or, we can split it up here
and part ways as friends.

855
00:54:44,866 --> 00:54:46,368
But I will tell you this.

856
00:54:46,401 --> 00:54:48,136
That money...

857
00:54:48,169 --> 00:54:51,807
well, ain't worth a nickel
this side of the border.

858
00:54:51,841 --> 00:54:53,776
Not unless you know
where to spend it.

859
00:54:53,810 --> 00:54:54,877
And boys...

860
00:54:56,243 --> 00:54:57,245
I do.

861
00:54:59,515 --> 00:55:01,651
What about this Briggs fella?

862
00:55:01,683 --> 00:55:02,928
Yeah, we're gonna have to
figure that out

863
00:55:02,952 --> 00:55:04,386
and figure it out fast.

864
00:55:04,419 --> 00:55:05,687
It's all part of the plan.

865
00:55:05,722 --> 00:55:07,423
Should we wait for him
and set a ambush

866
00:55:07,457 --> 00:55:09,156
like we did for the marshal?

867
00:55:09,191 --> 00:55:11,493
We don't know how far
behind us Briggs might be.

868
00:55:11,526 --> 00:55:14,196
We could be sittin'
in the bush for days.

869
00:55:14,229 --> 00:55:16,365
And two, Briggs
ain't the type of man

870
00:55:16,399 --> 00:55:18,401
to walk into
an ambush unprepared.

871
00:55:19,569 --> 00:55:20,870
Then how do we hunt him down?

872
00:55:20,903 --> 00:55:23,906
I thought I made myself clear.

873
00:55:23,939 --> 00:55:25,774
We ain't huntin' nobody.

874
00:55:27,709 --> 00:55:29,645
Briggs is huntin' us.

875
00:55:29,678 --> 00:55:31,347
[chuckles]

876
00:55:31,381 --> 00:55:38,285
[ominous music playing]

877
00:55:40,490 --> 00:55:42,256
[horses snort]

878
00:55:50,499 --> 00:55:51,868
What do we need that for?

879
00:55:51,901 --> 00:55:53,336
It's good firewood.

880
00:55:56,270 --> 00:55:57,774
That was on someone's grave.

881
00:55:57,807 --> 00:55:58,807
So?

882
00:56:00,575 --> 00:56:02,444
It belongs to someone.

883
00:56:05,348 --> 00:56:07,716
Nothing belongs to the dead...

884
00:56:07,749 --> 00:56:09,752
because the dead
don't need anything.

885
00:56:09,785 --> 00:56:12,754
Only the living
need to possess things.

886
00:56:12,789 --> 00:56:16,223
The living need food,
water, shelter,

887
00:56:16,258 --> 00:56:21,363
clothes, family,
money, and land.

888
00:56:21,397 --> 00:56:25,334
But the dead, the dead've
already been tended to.

889
00:56:25,368 --> 00:56:27,669
Once they're put in the ground,

890
00:56:27,703 --> 00:56:29,405
they have all they need.

891
00:56:29,439 --> 00:56:30,872
They're not selfish.

892
00:56:32,008 --> 00:56:34,310
I like the dead.

893
00:56:34,343 --> 00:56:36,243
[acoustic guitar music playing]

894
00:56:48,725 --> 00:56:50,292
[horses snort]

895
00:56:58,633 --> 00:57:00,435
[Eustice] I don't like this.

896
00:57:00,470 --> 00:57:01,738
There's a sheriff.

897
00:57:01,770 --> 00:57:03,606
Well, the sheriff's in Denver.

898
00:57:03,638 --> 00:57:05,006
Two days away.

899
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:07,274
We cut the telegraph lines
coming into town,

900
00:57:07,310 --> 00:57:08,886
which means it'll be
upwards of four days

901
00:57:08,910 --> 00:57:10,723
before any sheriff can get
the news that we're here

902
00:57:10,747 --> 00:57:12,515
and show up to do
anything about it.

903
00:57:12,548 --> 00:57:14,549
That office is where
they keep the bad folks

904
00:57:14,584 --> 00:57:16,752
until the lawman
can come pick 'em up.

905
00:57:16,785 --> 00:57:18,488
[horses whinny]

906
00:57:20,423 --> 00:57:21,457
[Eustice] Still...

907
00:57:21,490 --> 00:57:23,593
feelin' mighty exposed

908
00:57:23,626 --> 00:57:24,993
ridin' into town like this.

909
00:57:25,026 --> 00:57:26,729
You gonna question
my every call?

910
00:57:28,964 --> 00:57:30,932
Now, I need you boys
to set a guard

911
00:57:30,966 --> 00:57:32,299
at the edge of town, all right?

912
00:57:32,334 --> 00:57:34,703
Anyone rides in,
you let me know.

913
00:57:34,736 --> 00:57:36,805
And rotate every couple hours.

914
00:57:36,839 --> 00:57:38,540
Y'all look like dog shit.

915
00:57:38,573 --> 00:57:40,017
I need you rested for
when Briggs gets here

916
00:57:40,042 --> 00:57:41,410
or you're of no use to me.

917
00:57:41,444 --> 00:57:44,046
Understand?

918
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:47,350
And ladies,
I assume you're well rested.

919
00:57:47,383 --> 00:57:49,919
I am in need of your services.

920
00:57:49,952 --> 00:57:52,053
You heard him.
Who wants first watch?

921
00:57:55,457 --> 00:57:57,325
Well, I'll take first watch.

922
00:57:57,359 --> 00:57:59,629
But you better come
and relieve me in four hours.

923
00:58:02,798 --> 00:58:04,678
[Big Mike] You want to
give me a hand with this?

924
00:58:04,767 --> 00:58:06,301
[grunts]

925
00:58:07,736 --> 00:58:12,073
[foreboding music]

926
00:58:16,946 --> 00:58:19,381
That marshal said
you used to kill people.

927
00:58:19,415 --> 00:58:21,716
That marshal should
guard his words

928
00:58:21,751 --> 00:58:23,452
when speaking to children.

929
00:58:26,589 --> 00:58:28,423
[sighs]

930
00:58:28,457 --> 00:58:29,691
Is it true?

931
00:58:29,725 --> 00:58:30,792
Yes.

932
00:58:37,633 --> 00:58:38,968
He said you gave it up.

933
00:58:40,937 --> 00:58:42,671
He said you gave it up for Mama.

934
00:58:47,142 --> 00:58:48,544
Is that true?

935
00:58:57,553 --> 00:58:59,421
He said Mama changed you.

936
00:59:03,658 --> 00:59:05,394
My entire life...

937
00:59:06,428 --> 00:59:08,698
even as a boy, I knew.

938
00:59:10,031 --> 00:59:11,667
I knew I was different.

939
00:59:14,836 --> 00:59:18,607
My mother always said
I didn't cry as a baby.

940
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:19,941
I didn't laugh.

941
00:59:21,910 --> 00:59:24,145
When my mother died,
I was very young,

942
00:59:24,180 --> 00:59:26,582
but I didn't shed a tear
at her funeral.

943
00:59:26,615 --> 00:59:29,819
Lots of folks did, but I didn't.

944
00:59:29,852 --> 00:59:32,087
Growing up, the other kids
would play games

945
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:33,488
and joke with each other,

946
00:59:33,522 --> 00:59:35,457
and they would cry...

947
00:59:35,490 --> 00:59:38,127
if they got hurt
or if they were scared.

948
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:39,861
And I'd watch 'em.

949
00:59:40,962 --> 00:59:42,932
I got pretty good at pretending.

950
00:59:44,734 --> 00:59:47,636
Good enough, anyway.

951
00:59:47,669 --> 00:59:50,606
Pretending I was like
the other kids.

952
00:59:51,607 --> 00:59:53,475
Pretending I was...

953
00:59:54,609 --> 00:59:55,810
normal.

954
00:59:57,647 --> 01:00:01,450
That's when I realized
I had never known fear.

955
01:00:02,952 --> 01:00:05,020
My whole life, I'd seen fear

956
01:00:05,053 --> 01:00:07,656
in the eyes of
every man I ever met.

957
01:00:07,689 --> 01:00:09,658
I've come to expect it.

958
01:00:09,691 --> 01:00:13,095
Grown men, terrified when
they had no reason to be.

959
01:00:17,700 --> 01:00:19,935
I remember this one man
who was looking for me

960
01:00:19,968 --> 01:00:21,937
because I had shot
a couple of his friends.

961
01:00:23,638 --> 01:00:26,207
He caught up with me
in a bathhouse.

962
01:00:26,241 --> 01:00:29,577
My pistol's lying out of reach,
next to my clothes.

963
01:00:29,611 --> 01:00:33,249
And I remember seeing
this man holding a gun

964
01:00:33,281 --> 01:00:36,084
on a cold, naked man
sitting in a tub,

965
01:00:36,118 --> 01:00:38,053
and yet, he was the one shaking.

966
01:00:38,086 --> 01:00:39,988
[scoffs] Too scared to move.

967
01:00:42,792 --> 01:00:46,095
So, I stood up from my bath,

968
01:00:46,127 --> 01:00:50,098
and I quietly
walked over to the man

969
01:00:50,131 --> 01:00:52,100
and I took his pistol away.

970
01:00:55,705 --> 01:00:58,006
And then I shot him
dead with it.

971
01:01:00,209 --> 01:01:02,178
He didn't even beg for his life.

972
01:01:08,751 --> 01:01:12,287
And even though I could
recognize fear in men,

973
01:01:12,321 --> 01:01:16,091
even to a point where I could
use it against them,

974
01:01:16,124 --> 01:01:19,995
I can honestly say I had no
idea what it actually felt like.

975
01:01:22,198 --> 01:01:23,765
It was as if...

976
01:01:25,633 --> 01:01:27,102
I'd been born...

977
01:01:28,236 --> 01:01:29,839
dead inside.

978
01:01:32,008 --> 01:01:33,676
But I didn't care.

979
01:01:35,044 --> 01:01:36,611
'Cause I was dead inside.

980
01:01:39,015 --> 01:01:41,716
[Briggs sips, sighs]

981
01:01:50,258 --> 01:01:52,028
How did Mama change that?

982
01:01:54,897 --> 01:01:58,267
When I met your mother,
there was no introduction.

983
01:01:58,299 --> 01:02:00,569
There was no getting
to know each other.

984
01:02:02,372 --> 01:02:05,274
And in that first moment,
I saw her.

985
01:02:08,310 --> 01:02:09,879
I felt something.

986
01:02:12,881 --> 01:02:14,716
Something I'd never felt before.

987
01:02:16,285 --> 01:02:17,285
Love?

988
01:02:19,754 --> 01:02:22,792
Fear.

989
01:02:22,825 --> 01:02:26,261
Fear she wouldn't talk to me.
Fear she wouldn't love me.

990
01:02:28,129 --> 01:02:30,131
Fear I couldn't
make her my wife.

991
01:02:31,133 --> 01:02:33,234
[sobs]

992
01:02:34,370 --> 01:02:36,638
Fear of losing her.

993
01:02:43,011 --> 01:02:45,981
She was the only thing
I ever feared...

994
01:02:46,015 --> 01:02:47,294
and the only thing I ever loved.

995
01:02:51,986 --> 01:02:56,859
[somber music]

996
01:03:01,162 --> 01:03:04,165
When they told me Mama was dead,
I didn't know how to feel.

997
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:06,167
She was your mother.

998
01:03:06,202 --> 01:03:09,104
You feel sad. You feel loss.

999
01:03:10,339 --> 01:03:12,006
Is that how you felt?

1000
01:03:13,209 --> 01:03:14,709
I felt pain.

1001
01:03:16,979 --> 01:03:19,115
Like a part of me
was killed with her.

1002
01:03:21,683 --> 01:03:23,285
Do you still feel like that?

1003
01:03:28,890 --> 01:03:31,926
When Mama died,
I didn't feel anything.

1004
01:03:37,198 --> 01:03:39,001
It was as if I died.

1005
01:03:44,772 --> 01:03:45,932
[whispering] Like I was lost.

1006
01:03:47,743 --> 01:03:50,979
I was lying in my bed,
in my room...

1007
01:03:53,749 --> 01:03:55,183
in our house.

1008
01:03:59,988 --> 01:04:02,191
But it felt like I would
never find my way back

1009
01:04:02,223 --> 01:04:03,325
to those things again.

1010
01:04:04,959 --> 01:04:06,194
You will.

1011
01:04:18,908 --> 01:04:20,477
Do you know the man
who killed Mama?

1012
01:04:20,510 --> 01:04:23,211
The man the marshal
told us about?

1013
01:04:24,314 --> 01:04:26,814
James McCallister?

1014
01:04:31,019 --> 01:04:33,888
Tomorrow,
after the sun comes up...

1015
01:04:36,892 --> 01:04:38,194
can you teach me how to shoot?

1016
01:04:44,366 --> 01:04:45,366
Good.

1017
01:04:48,069 --> 01:04:49,406
I think I'd like that.

1018
01:04:51,073 --> 01:04:57,879
[dramatic music]

1019
01:05:06,155 --> 01:05:09,158
Oh! Son of a bitch.

1020
01:05:09,191 --> 01:05:12,127
Oh. Oh, damn it.

1021
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:14,897
Now remember,
keep your left eye closed.

1022
01:05:14,930 --> 01:05:18,435
Let the barrel drift
right above your target.

1023
01:05:18,468 --> 01:05:21,836
When you're ready,
gently breathe

1024
01:05:21,870 --> 01:05:25,207
all the air out of your lungs
and let the barrel fall.

1025
01:05:25,240 --> 01:05:29,912
Time it so your breath ends
just as you line up your shot.

1026
01:05:29,944 --> 01:05:31,280
At the bottom of your breath,

1027
01:05:31,314 --> 01:05:33,848
squeeze the trigger, don't pull,

1028
01:05:33,881 --> 01:05:35,460
- Squeeze with your whole hand.
- [gun shot]

1029
01:05:35,484 --> 01:05:37,051
[Brooke gasps]

1030
01:05:45,327 --> 01:05:47,062
Were you aiming for the hat?

1031
01:05:47,095 --> 01:05:48,397
Just below it.

1032
01:05:48,430 --> 01:05:50,399
I was aiming for his chest.

1033
01:05:50,432 --> 01:05:52,801
You pulled. You didn't squeeze.

1034
01:05:56,305 --> 01:05:57,506
Let's try it again.

1035
01:06:03,011 --> 01:06:05,448
- [sighs]
- What's wrong?

1036
01:06:07,283 --> 01:06:08,816
Can I try the pistol?

1037
01:06:10,486 --> 01:06:12,421
[Briggs] H'yah! Hit!

1038
01:06:12,455 --> 01:06:14,390
[jaunty music playing]

1039
01:06:14,423 --> 01:06:16,191
Remember to squeeze.

1040
01:06:16,225 --> 01:06:17,258
Don't pull.

1041
01:06:23,600 --> 01:06:27,269
[sweeping music]

1042
01:06:40,582 --> 01:06:42,452
Morning, Eustice.

1043
01:06:42,484 --> 01:06:45,921
Those turkey bungholes never
relieved me of duty last night.

1044
01:06:45,953 --> 01:06:48,089
Left me sittin' out there
all night!

1045
01:06:48,122 --> 01:06:49,223
Is that so?

1046
01:06:50,359 --> 01:06:53,095
Boys? Come on down.

1047
01:06:53,127 --> 01:06:54,363
What is it, boss?

1048
01:06:54,397 --> 01:06:56,432
Eustice here has a grievance

1049
01:06:56,466 --> 01:06:58,501
he would like to air with
the rest of the gang.

1050
01:06:58,535 --> 01:07:01,303
- Go ahead.
- [Eustice] You two!

1051
01:07:01,337 --> 01:07:04,307
You were supposed to relieve me
in my post after four hours.

1052
01:07:04,341 --> 01:07:06,376
And that didn't happen.

1053
01:07:06,408 --> 01:07:08,010
And that's bullshit!

1054
01:07:08,042 --> 01:07:09,977
Eustice, please accept
my sincerest apologies

1055
01:07:10,011 --> 01:07:11,414
on behalf of
the rest of the gang.

1056
01:07:11,448 --> 01:07:14,950
We sure are sorry,
ain't we, boys?

1057
01:07:14,982 --> 01:07:16,586
And why didn't you
just come get us?

1058
01:07:17,952 --> 01:07:19,153
What?

1059
01:07:19,187 --> 01:07:21,557
If we were supposed to
relieve you,

1060
01:07:21,591 --> 01:07:23,926
why didn't you just come get
one of us to take your place?

1061
01:07:23,959 --> 01:07:26,227
Eustice? Why didn't you just
come get one of the boys?

1062
01:07:26,261 --> 01:07:30,432
Well, I... I didn't want to
leave my post, you know?

1063
01:07:30,466 --> 01:07:32,401
Briggs is a dangerous man.

1064
01:07:32,435 --> 01:07:35,136
And if he would've seen
there was no guard,

1065
01:07:35,169 --> 01:07:36,972
he might have snuck
in here and got us.

1066
01:07:37,004 --> 01:07:39,575
You didn't...
fall asleep, did you?

1067
01:07:39,609 --> 01:07:42,144
[suspenseful music]

1068
01:07:42,176 --> 01:07:43,379
No, boss.

1069
01:07:43,412 --> 01:07:46,316
Eustice...

1070
01:07:46,348 --> 01:07:48,149
you wouldn't be lying to me,
would you?

1071
01:07:48,182 --> 01:07:50,952
No, boss. I mean,
I... I might've...

1072
01:07:50,986 --> 01:07:53,222
I might've shut my eyes
for a second or two as I...

1073
01:07:53,254 --> 01:07:54,490
You know, was so tired.

1074
01:07:54,524 --> 01:07:56,066
It was... it was a
long ride and I... I...

1075
01:07:56,091 --> 01:07:57,091
Eustice, shh.

1076
01:07:59,629 --> 01:08:00,928
Oh.

1077
01:08:03,031 --> 01:08:07,236
Falling asleep on guard duty
is a terrible thing to do.

1078
01:08:07,269 --> 01:08:09,439
What if Briggs had shown up
and you'd been asleep?

1079
01:08:09,472 --> 01:08:11,508
[Big Mike] Yeah. Yeah,

1080
01:08:11,540 --> 01:08:13,642
he might have snuck in and
got us, like you said.

1081
01:08:13,676 --> 01:08:15,511
No. I would have seen him.

1082
01:08:15,544 --> 01:08:18,280
- [bones crack]
- [screams]

1083
01:08:18,313 --> 01:08:20,416
- [James shushes]
- [whimpers]

1084
01:08:20,450 --> 01:08:23,719
Now, I did you a favor.
All right?

1085
01:08:23,752 --> 01:08:26,555
Next time you're on watch,
you get a little sleepy,

1086
01:08:26,589 --> 01:08:29,325
you just give that
broken finger a squeeze,

1087
01:08:29,358 --> 01:08:31,026
and you'll perk right back up.

1088
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:38,966
[Brooke] What's wrong?

1089
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:42,103
There's only one way into town.

1090
01:08:42,136 --> 01:08:44,039
If they're down there,

1091
01:08:44,072 --> 01:08:45,711
they'll be watching
everyone who comes in.

1092
01:08:50,144 --> 01:08:52,348
They left a message in the barn.

1093
01:08:52,381 --> 01:08:53,750
It felt familiar.

1094
01:08:53,782 --> 01:08:56,084
Like it was meant for me.

1095
01:08:57,687 --> 01:08:59,287
What'd it say?

1096
01:09:03,291 --> 01:09:06,528
I don't like walking in, not
knowing who I'm looking for.

1097
01:09:06,563 --> 01:09:09,097
If they know me,
it'll give them the edge.

1098
01:09:09,130 --> 01:09:10,633
They'll see me coming.

1099
01:09:10,666 --> 01:09:12,233
I won't see them.

1100
01:09:14,236 --> 01:09:16,170
Do you think they'll know me?

1101
01:09:22,745 --> 01:09:25,348
[Briggs] <i>Now you</i>
<i>ride into town casually.</i>

1102
01:09:25,380 --> 01:09:28,651
<i>You've been sent on an errand
from your parents' farm up the road.</i>

1103
01:09:28,684 --> 01:09:31,085
<i>Keep your head up,
and look at everyone carefully.</i>

1104
01:09:44,334 --> 01:09:46,768
<i>Head straight for
the mercantile.</i>

1105
01:09:46,803 --> 01:09:50,473
<i>Go inside and ask the man
to buy something.</i>

1106
01:09:50,506 --> 01:09:54,344
<i>And then casually ask if any
riders had come through town.</i>

1107
01:09:56,446 --> 01:09:59,415
<i>Whatever he tells you,
you bring that information</i>

1108
01:09:59,448 --> 01:10:01,384
<i>straight back to me.</i>

1109
01:10:06,656 --> 01:10:07,736
Can I help you, young lady?

1110
01:10:10,192 --> 01:10:11,192
Young lady?

1111
01:10:14,764 --> 01:10:17,198
Pardon my manners.
You must have caught me daydreaming.

1112
01:10:17,232 --> 01:10:19,835
I almost forgot
why I came in here.

1113
01:10:19,868 --> 01:10:21,470
My mama got it in
her head yesterday

1114
01:10:21,504 --> 01:10:22,738
that she had to bake a cake

1115
01:10:22,772 --> 01:10:24,506
for the church potluck
this weekend.

1116
01:10:24,541 --> 01:10:26,742
Last year, she made a pie,
but the apples that she used

1117
01:10:26,776 --> 01:10:28,310
grew on Mr. Johnson's
apple tree,

1118
01:10:28,344 --> 01:10:30,112
the one back by his outhouse.

1119
01:10:30,144 --> 01:10:31,347
And wouldn't you know it,

1120
01:10:31,380 --> 01:10:33,081
those apples tasted
plum like shit

1121
01:10:33,115 --> 01:10:35,283
and made anyone who ate
them sick to their gut.

1122
01:10:35,317 --> 01:10:37,420
I tell ya', I think that
shit in that outhouse

1123
01:10:37,452 --> 01:10:38,688
soaked down into the roots

1124
01:10:38,720 --> 01:10:40,264
and changed the way
a basic apple can taste.

1125
01:10:40,289 --> 01:10:42,791
But Mr. Johnson says
that's a bunch of hooey,

1126
01:10:42,825 --> 01:10:44,527
and because of that,
he won't let Mama

1127
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:46,295
have any more apples
for her apple pie,

1128
01:10:46,328 --> 01:10:48,598
which, as far as I'm concerned,
is fine by me and Mama

1129
01:10:48,630 --> 01:10:49,841
because like I mentioned before,

1130
01:10:49,866 --> 01:10:51,834
those apples
taste like shit anyhow.

1131
01:10:53,234 --> 01:10:54,504
Who the hell is Mr. Johnson?

1132
01:11:04,145 --> 01:11:06,247
[Big Mike] Is this
the little girl you seen, Boots?

1133
01:11:07,817 --> 01:11:10,687
It is the little girl we
saw the other morning.

1134
01:11:10,719 --> 01:11:13,523
Hello there, little miss.

1135
01:11:13,555 --> 01:11:15,692
That's a fine horse
you're riding.

1136
01:11:15,724 --> 01:11:19,328
Couldn't help
but notice the saddle.

1137
01:11:19,362 --> 01:11:21,362
Wouldn't mind telling me
how you got it, would you?

1138
01:11:22,665 --> 01:11:24,334
Better yet...

1139
01:11:24,367 --> 01:11:26,501
Why don't you just tell me
where your daddy is?

1140
01:11:26,536 --> 01:11:28,837
[tense music playing]

1141
01:11:33,843 --> 01:11:37,647
Maria, this here is
my little sister.

1142
01:11:37,679 --> 01:11:40,282
<i>- Buenos dias.</i>
- [chuckles]

1143
01:11:43,819 --> 01:11:45,321
[Boots] Still no sign of him.

1144
01:11:45,354 --> 01:11:47,490
[James] Hm.

1145
01:11:47,523 --> 01:11:48,933
He'll be around soon enough,
I 'spect.

1146
01:11:48,957 --> 01:11:50,792
This one hasn't
touched her food.

1147
01:11:50,826 --> 01:11:52,894
I 'spect she's
too scared to eat.

1148
01:11:52,929 --> 01:11:54,764
Is that it, little sister?

1149
01:11:54,796 --> 01:11:56,164
You too scared to eat?

1150
01:11:56,799 --> 01:11:57,834
No.

1151
01:12:00,301 --> 01:12:01,603
[James] Of course not.

1152
01:12:01,638 --> 01:12:02,947
'Spect the daughter
of Colton Briggs

1153
01:12:02,972 --> 01:12:04,238
ain't scared of nothin'.

1154
01:12:10,612 --> 01:12:12,615
You boys hang that sign
outside like I asked?

1155
01:12:12,648 --> 01:12:14,951
Red paint. Just like you asked.

1156
01:12:14,983 --> 01:12:16,952
Good. Where's Big Mike?

1157
01:12:16,986 --> 01:12:19,286
He's got a good angle
at the road into town.

1158
01:12:19,322 --> 01:12:21,357
Ah, well.

1159
01:12:21,390 --> 01:12:23,425
One of you set up
at the other end of town.

1160
01:12:23,459 --> 01:12:25,394
- The other across the street.
- Yes, sir.

1161
01:12:26,696 --> 01:12:28,630
Oh, and, boys...

1162
01:12:28,665 --> 01:12:30,500
Stay out of sight, all right?

1163
01:12:30,532 --> 01:12:31,943
It's important he gets to
the middle of town

1164
01:12:31,968 --> 01:12:33,603
and sees our invitation

1165
01:12:33,635 --> 01:12:35,671
before we throw him his
little surprise party.

1166
01:12:35,705 --> 01:12:38,741
Boss, if we get a chance to put
a bullet in Colton Briggs,

1167
01:12:38,774 --> 01:12:40,576
we oughta do it.

1168
01:12:40,609 --> 01:12:43,210
It ain't smart playing games
with a fella like that.

1169
01:12:43,245 --> 01:12:45,415
Sounds like he's
the one who's scared.

1170
01:12:45,447 --> 01:12:46,883
[chuckles]

1171
01:12:48,584 --> 01:12:50,452
Sure does, doesn't it?

1172
01:12:52,755 --> 01:12:54,456
You hear what little
sister just said?

1173
01:12:55,323 --> 01:12:56,492
You scared?

1174
01:12:56,526 --> 01:12:58,460
I'll take the other end of town.

1175
01:13:00,028 --> 01:13:01,798
[doors swing]

1176
01:13:04,533 --> 01:13:06,300
[horses neigh]

1177
01:13:10,807 --> 01:13:12,642
[Eustice] Boss is
expecting Briggs anytime.

1178
01:13:12,675 --> 01:13:15,510
Might wanna wake your ass up.

1179
01:13:15,545 --> 01:13:19,916
- I'm awake.
- [Eustice] Good. Keep it that way.

1180
01:13:19,948 --> 01:13:22,919
We're supposed to let him get
into town before we kill him.

1181
01:13:22,951 --> 01:13:25,252
He wants him to see that we got
his daughter or something.

1182
01:13:25,286 --> 01:13:27,322
- Makes sense.
- [gun cocks]

1183
01:13:27,356 --> 01:13:28,925
You do yourself and
all of us a favor.

1184
01:13:28,957 --> 01:13:31,259
You see that son of a bitch,

1185
01:13:31,292 --> 01:13:32,428
you put a bullet in him.

1186
01:13:34,831 --> 01:13:35,831
H'yah!

1187
01:13:40,603 --> 01:13:41,837
Go back right there.

1188
01:13:48,710 --> 01:13:50,379
If you ain't too scared to eat,

1189
01:13:50,412 --> 01:13:51,723
why ain't you
touched your food yet?

1190
01:13:51,747 --> 01:13:53,014
It's probably poison.

1191
01:13:53,049 --> 01:13:54,649
So you is scared.

1192
01:13:55,751 --> 01:13:57,420
Scared of poison.

1193
01:13:57,452 --> 01:13:59,554
You don't have to be scared
to not eat poison.

1194
01:14:00,456 --> 01:14:01,823
Just not stupid.

1195
01:14:05,495 --> 01:14:06,495
[James] You see this?

1196
01:14:11,733 --> 01:14:13,635
No poison.

1197
01:14:13,669 --> 01:14:16,339
I couldn't poison you
even if I wanted to.

1198
01:14:16,371 --> 01:14:19,575
Reckon it's some kind of
sin to poison your kin.

1199
01:14:22,444 --> 01:14:23,645
Stop saying that.

1200
01:14:24,781 --> 01:14:26,415
Stop sayin' what?

1201
01:14:26,448 --> 01:14:28,850
Stop calling me your sister.

1202
01:14:28,884 --> 01:14:30,419
We ain't kin.

1203
01:14:30,452 --> 01:14:31,829
[James] You and I are
most certainly kin

1204
01:14:31,853 --> 01:14:33,456
in almost all respects.

1205
01:14:33,488 --> 01:14:36,725
The uh... fruits of
your father's labors.

1206
01:14:36,759 --> 01:14:41,363
[chuckles] Sure as shootin'.

1207
01:14:41,397 --> 01:14:43,366
- You're a liar.
- [James] I'm not saying that

1208
01:14:43,398 --> 01:14:46,001
your daddy knocked my mama up
and they made a baby.

1209
01:14:46,035 --> 01:14:48,069
No, no, no.

1210
01:14:48,103 --> 01:14:50,515
There was another man who had
the honors of my physical birth.

1211
01:14:50,540 --> 01:14:54,410
But he's not around no more...

1212
01:14:54,442 --> 01:14:57,345
on account of the day
I like to call my...

1213
01:14:57,380 --> 01:14:59,514
"spiritual birth."

1214
01:14:59,549 --> 01:15:03,352
You see, it was on that day
that your daddy...

1215
01:15:03,385 --> 01:15:05,720
he decided I didn't
need mine anymore.

1216
01:15:05,755 --> 01:15:07,622
He took him away from me.

1217
01:15:07,657 --> 01:15:08,890
Right there in front of me.

1218
01:15:10,559 --> 01:15:12,795
I watched him die.

1219
01:15:12,828 --> 01:15:14,796
Watched the life leave his eyes.

1220
01:15:17,399 --> 01:15:18,976
It was right then that
I stared into the eyes

1221
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:20,041
of the man who killed him.

1222
01:15:21,603 --> 01:15:23,072
And you know what
your daddy did?

1223
01:15:25,741 --> 01:15:27,076
He stared right back at me.

1224
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:33,115
Then he...

1225
01:15:33,148 --> 01:15:35,718
he got on his horse
and he rode away.

1226
01:15:38,720 --> 01:15:39,956
But not all of him.

1227
01:15:39,988 --> 01:15:42,858
No. See, he...

1228
01:15:42,892 --> 01:15:44,794
he left a tiny little
piece of himself

1229
01:15:44,826 --> 01:15:46,528
buried deep inside of me.

1230
01:15:47,196 --> 01:15:48,798
Like a seed.

1231
01:15:48,831 --> 01:15:51,000
[suspenseful music]

1232
01:16:04,112 --> 01:16:08,483
[tense music]

1233
01:16:18,661 --> 01:16:21,731
Workin' on
a little insurance policy.

1234
01:16:21,764 --> 01:16:24,466
We don't need those
boys gettin' any ideas

1235
01:16:24,500 --> 01:16:26,035
about running off
with the money.

1236
01:16:27,903 --> 01:16:30,106
[chuckles] It used to be
you couldn't find nothing

1237
01:16:30,139 --> 01:16:31,706
around these parts
except tequila.

1238
01:16:34,042 --> 01:16:36,011
Finding whiskey in Santa Rosa?

1239
01:16:36,045 --> 01:16:37,145
It's progress.

1240
01:16:39,482 --> 01:16:42,550
You see, the problem
with progress

1241
01:16:42,585 --> 01:16:44,019
is that something's gonna go.

1242
01:16:44,053 --> 01:16:46,222
In with the new,

1243
01:16:46,255 --> 01:16:47,456
out with the old.

1244
01:16:49,524 --> 01:16:50,792
That's the way of the world.

1245
01:16:52,827 --> 01:16:54,095
But this transition...

1246
01:16:56,165 --> 01:17:01,202
Oh, it's rarely a peaceful one.
No, ma'am.

1247
01:17:01,237 --> 01:17:03,072
Transition of power
is one of violence.

1248
01:17:03,104 --> 01:17:04,706
Necessary violence.

1249
01:17:07,175 --> 01:17:08,844
Which is why we're here today.

1250
01:17:10,045 --> 01:17:11,212
You see...

1251
01:17:12,848 --> 01:17:15,584
I got a monster inside of me.

1252
01:17:15,617 --> 01:17:17,953
The devil himself.

1253
01:17:17,987 --> 01:17:19,854
That devil can't get out

1254
01:17:19,889 --> 01:17:22,089
as long as there's another
devil out there in the world.

1255
01:17:22,657 --> 01:17:25,126
Both these devils...

1256
01:17:25,161 --> 01:17:26,862
can't exist at the same time.

1257
01:17:28,898 --> 01:17:30,099
Oh, I get it.

1258
01:17:31,867 --> 01:17:32,969
You're crazy.

1259
01:17:36,072 --> 01:17:39,175
But don't worry, my father will
be here soon. He'll fix that.

1260
01:17:42,312 --> 01:17:43,778
[James] Hmm, you know,

1261
01:17:45,915 --> 01:17:48,250
I'm glad we had
this time together.

1262
01:17:48,283 --> 01:17:50,952
Get to know each other
as siblings.

1263
01:17:52,587 --> 01:17:54,023
'Cause after tonight,

1264
01:17:54,055 --> 01:17:55,992
after your father gets here...

1265
01:17:58,928 --> 01:18:00,830
well, I'm gonna be
your new daddy.

1266
01:18:02,264 --> 01:18:04,032
And we'll see what needs fixin'.

Eustice!

1271
01:18:58,153 --> 01:18:59,854
[grunts] Oh, he's here.

1272
01:19:00,389 --> 01:19:01,657
Eustice!

1273
01:19:01,689 --> 01:19:03,091
He's here!

1274
01:19:03,125 --> 01:19:04,125
Help!

1275
01:19:05,362 --> 01:19:06,828
He's here.

1276
01:19:09,865 --> 01:19:11,200
[groans]

1277
01:19:17,340 --> 01:19:19,974

1279
01:19:23,978 --> 01:19:25,814
[Boots] Holy shit.

[gunshots]

1281
01:19:31,120 --> 01:19:32,955
He's here!

1282
01:19:32,987 --> 01:19:34,223
He done killed Big Mike,

1283
01:19:34,255 --> 01:19:35,657
and got one of them
Mexican cowboys!

1284
01:19:37,759 --> 01:19:39,728
The devil does not disappoint.

1285
01:19:41,296 --> 01:19:42,997
Let's go see Pa.

1286
01:19:48,670 --> 01:19:49,772
Walk.

[horse neighs]

1289
01:20:01,050 --> 01:20:02,184
He went down that alley,

1290
01:20:02,218 --> 01:20:04,120
behind these buildings.

1291
01:20:04,152 --> 01:20:05,354
Go around and flush him out.

1292
01:20:07,689 --> 01:20:09,358
Christ Almighty.

1293
01:20:09,392 --> 01:20:11,759
Eustice, did you hear what said?

1294
01:20:11,794 --> 01:20:12,794
Go!

1295

[horse neighs]

1296
01:20:23,139 --> 01:20:24,673
I got you, <i>pendejo.</i>

1297
01:20:43,224 --> 01:20:44,361
You see him?

1298
01:20:44,393 --> 01:20:45,794
He must've circled back.

1299
01:20:45,827 --> 01:20:47,095

1302
01:20:57,374 --> 01:21:00,309
I got him! He got Boots,
but I shot him!

1303
01:21:00,343 --> 01:21:03,380
- Is he dead?
- [Eustice] No. I only winged him.

1304
01:21:03,412 --> 01:21:06,247
But he's got a bullet in him,
sure as shit.

1305
01:21:06,282 --> 01:21:09,050
He's holed up in that building
over there by the alley.

1306
01:21:09,084 --> 01:21:10,952
You're sure about that?

1307
01:21:10,986 --> 01:21:12,854
He seem like the type of
fella to just hole up

1308
01:21:12,888 --> 01:21:14,167
and wait for us to come get him?

1309
01:21:16,526 --> 01:21:17,992
Guess we'll see.

1310
01:21:20,028 --> 01:21:21,063
[grunts]

1311
01:21:28,170 --> 01:21:29,339
[James] You two.

1312
01:21:29,371 --> 01:21:31,040
You see that mercantile?

1313
01:21:31,072 --> 01:21:32,917
Now, the villain that killed
your buddy is inside.

1314
01:21:32,942 --> 01:21:34,510
Why don't you go
in there and get him?

1315
01:21:34,544 --> 01:21:36,424
I'll double your pay
if you bring him out alive.

1316
01:21:38,380 --> 01:21:40,916
Be careful now. He's a snake.

1317
01:21:40,950 --> 01:21:42,460
[Eustice] He may be
a snake but he ain't

1318
01:21:42,484 --> 01:21:44,085
- a Goddamn wizard.
- Eustice...

1319
01:21:46,854 --> 01:21:48,256
[grunts]

1320
01:21:49,992 --> 01:21:51,794
[James] I need you
to just trust me.

1321
01:21:52,495 --> 01:21:54,496
Can you do that?

1322
01:21:54,531 --> 01:21:56,374
Shame to have to let you
go so close to the end.

1323

[James] Briggs!

1326
01:22:13,215 --> 01:22:15,850
I'm calling you out.

1327
01:22:15,884 --> 01:22:18,853
Ain't that what
you boys used to do?

1328
01:22:18,886 --> 01:22:21,256
Call each other out?

1329
01:22:21,290 --> 01:22:23,125
Settle your differences
in the street?

1330
01:22:26,595 --> 01:22:28,197
Let's do this the old way!

1333
01:22:53,289 --> 01:22:55,358
Holster that pistol, Mister.

1334
01:22:55,392 --> 01:22:58,192
I swear to God,
I'll kill this little girl.

1335
01:23:09,438 --> 01:23:10,872
Hello, handsome.

1336
01:23:11,573 --> 01:23:12,573
Remember me?

1337
01:23:17,211 --> 01:23:19,349
No.

1338
01:23:19,381 --> 01:23:20,517
[Eustice] Get your hands up.

1339
01:23:23,951 --> 01:23:25,254
Both of 'em.

1340
01:23:25,286 --> 01:23:27,121
It's busted.

1341
01:23:27,156 --> 01:23:29,492
[Eustice] You got him, boss.
What are we gonna do?

1342
01:23:31,627 --> 01:23:33,295
You really don't remember me.

1343
01:23:36,231 --> 01:23:38,966
I gotta say, hurts my feelings.

1344
01:23:41,236 --> 01:23:43,138
But I guess it's
not too surprising.

1345
01:23:43,171 --> 01:23:46,375
I was just a little whooper
last time you saw me.

1346
01:23:46,408 --> 01:23:47,544
The important thing is...

1347
01:23:49,277 --> 01:23:50,313
I remember you.

1348
01:23:54,651 --> 01:23:56,085
Don't worry.

1349
01:23:56,117 --> 01:23:58,152
I'm okay.

1350
01:23:58,187 --> 01:24:01,023
I definitely remember you,
Colton Briggs.

1351
01:24:02,325 --> 01:24:04,158
Every time I close my eyes,

1352
01:24:05,527 --> 01:24:06,961
I see your face...

1353
01:24:08,263 --> 01:24:09,599
staring me down.

1354
01:24:12,067 --> 01:24:14,571
I smell the smoke
from your guns,

1355
01:24:14,603 --> 01:24:17,272
hear the noises my
daddy made as he died.

1356
01:24:19,041 --> 01:24:20,309
And that's why we're here.

1357
01:24:21,577 --> 01:24:23,211
You, me...

1358
01:24:24,414 --> 01:24:25,914
your little girl.

1359
01:24:27,584 --> 01:24:29,151
She never would
tell me her name,

1360
01:24:29,184 --> 01:24:32,254
but it don't matter none.

1361
01:24:32,286 --> 01:24:34,323
We're just one big happy family.

1362

1363
01:24:38,993 --> 01:24:40,397
You see...

1364
01:24:40,429 --> 01:24:42,164
we're gonna have a showdown,
you and me.

1365
01:24:42,197 --> 01:24:45,701
And you get the opportunity
to put a bullet in my head

1366
01:24:45,734 --> 01:24:47,403
just like you did my daddy.

1367
01:24:48,537 --> 01:24:49,671
And if you do that,

1368
01:24:50,639 --> 01:24:52,375
Eustice here,

1369
01:24:52,408 --> 01:24:54,344
he's gonna blow
your little girl's head off.

1370
01:24:54,376 --> 01:24:56,412
- [Eustice] Boss, just kill him!
- Shut up!

1371
01:24:58,013 --> 01:24:59,013
Now...

1372
01:24:59,715 --> 01:25:01,518
you kill me...

1373
01:25:01,550 --> 01:25:03,184
and watch your little girl die.

1374
01:25:04,353 --> 01:25:06,423
Or save your daughter,

1375
01:25:06,456 --> 01:25:08,023
and watch me take your place.

1376

01:25:16,298 --> 01:25:18,032
I have all I need.

1378
01:25:19,067 --> 01:25:20,702
See that I'm tended to.

1379
01:25:20,737 --> 01:25:22,405
[sobs] No.

1380
01:25:25,240 --> 01:25:27,309
And... I love you.

Holy shit.

1384
01:25:37,719 --> 01:25:38,720
I did it!

[laughs]

1386
01:25:43,425 --> 01:25:44,992
I killed him!

1387
01:25:45,027 --> 01:25:49,298
I'm so sorry, Daddy.
I love you so much.

1388
01:25:49,331 --> 01:25:50,299
[James] I did it!

1389
01:25:50,332 --> 01:25:51,332
I'm so sorry.

I killed Colton Briggs!

1392
01:25:56,639 --> 01:25:58,206
I killed him!

1393
01:26:00,075 --> 01:26:01,376
You hear that, Daddy?

1394
01:26:01,411 --> 01:26:03,077
- [gun cocks]

1404
01:26:34,242 --> 01:26:37,714
take your mother.

1405
01:26:37,746 --> 01:26:41,049

[Jarrett] You alive?

1410
01:27:24,125 --> 01:27:26,461
Found another body
in the back alley back there.

1411
01:27:26,496 --> 01:27:29,130
That makes four of 'em.

1412
01:27:29,164 --> 01:27:31,133
[Jarrett] More or less
what I expected.

1413
01:27:31,166 --> 01:27:33,736
Round up the bodies
and let's get 'em back.

1415

Will they bring him home?

01:27:40,175 --> 01:27:41,376
Yeah, I suppose they will.

1417
01:27:42,444 --> 01:27:43,612
Thank you.

1418
01:27:47,916 --> 01:27:49,084
Marshal?

1419
01:27:51,853 --> 01:27:53,356
What are you going to tell them?

1420
01:27:56,258 --> 01:27:59,828
I thought I might bring you in
for what you and your daddy did.

1421
01:27:59,862 --> 01:28:04,800
Tell them how you captured us
and tortured us and...

1422
01:28:04,834 --> 01:28:07,402
left us to die
out in the desert.

1423
01:28:07,437 --> 01:28:11,707
But I suppose the judge would
just say that you were...

1424
01:28:11,741 --> 01:28:14,376
following your
daddy's orders and...

1425
01:28:14,410 --> 01:28:18,548
blind with rage over
your mama's murder...

1426
01:28:18,581 --> 01:28:21,451
even though you and I both
know that ain't quite true.

1427
01:28:22,852 --> 01:28:25,187
And in that case,

1428
01:28:25,219 --> 01:28:28,457
your daddy would be
buried as a criminal.

1429
01:28:28,491 --> 01:28:30,326
And you would go home

1430
01:28:30,359 --> 01:28:32,594
to try to figure out what to
do with your daddy's store.

1431
01:28:35,197 --> 01:28:37,599
Found a strongbox
in the saloon, Marshal.

1432
01:28:39,969 --> 01:28:41,571
Good work, Corporal.

1433
01:28:41,603 --> 01:28:42,839
That'll be all.

1434
01:28:47,977 --> 01:28:51,414
And then I considered telling
them that you and your daddy...

1435
01:28:51,447 --> 01:28:54,684
came along, and you
saved my deputy's life...

1436
01:28:54,716 --> 01:28:57,920
by performing field surgery
on his shoulder.

1437
01:28:57,953 --> 01:29:01,323
Then you proceeded to track
down your mother's murderers

1438
01:29:01,357 --> 01:29:06,260
and then he was killed in the
process of their apprehension

1439
01:29:06,294 --> 01:29:09,499
in which case you
would still go home.

1440
01:29:09,532 --> 01:29:11,500
So, I figure since the outcomes

1441
01:29:11,533 --> 01:29:14,469
in both those scenarios
are the same,

1442
01:29:14,504 --> 01:29:16,839
I prefer the story
that doesn't involve

1443
01:29:16,872 --> 01:29:19,375
me getting captured by
a 12-year-old girl.

1444
01:29:20,676 --> 01:29:22,879
And maybe in that version,

1445
01:29:22,911 --> 01:29:25,548
we can forget all about
that strong box, too.

1446
01:29:27,416 --> 01:29:28,785
In that version...

1447
01:29:30,687 --> 01:29:32,487
my daddy gets to be a hero?

1448
01:29:34,691 --> 01:29:35,892
[sighs]

1449
01:29:39,996 --> 01:29:42,732
In exchange for your discretion.

1450
01:29:42,764 --> 01:29:44,265
Yes.

1451
01:29:44,299 --> 01:29:47,636
I believe that
sounds about right.

1452
01:29:47,670 --> 01:29:49,203
Well then, it's decided.

1453
01:29:50,439 --> 01:29:51,607
Marshal?

1454
01:29:54,309 --> 01:29:55,545
Did you find your horse?

1455
01:29:56,679 --> 01:29:58,380
Tied up at the edge of town.

1456
01:30:01,783 --> 01:30:03,452
Just like he said.

1457
01:30:05,621 --> 01:30:08,357
You get on home, little Briggs.

1458
01:30:08,390 --> 01:30:09,925
Take care of your daddy's store.

1459
01:30:11,728 --> 01:30:13,496
- [horse snorts]
- H'yah.

1460
01:30:14,796 --> 01:30:18,367
[somber music playing]

1461
01:30:24,540 --> 01:30:26,273
You hear that, Daddy?

1462
01:30:27,676 --> 01:30:29,444
[crying] You're gonna be a hero.

1463
01:30:33,816 --> 01:30:35,718
Mama would be so proud.

1464
01:30:52,868 --> 01:30:54,469
Maria, isn't it?

1465
01:30:54,504 --> 01:30:56,405
<i>Si, Senorita.</i>

1466
01:30:56,438 --> 01:30:59,308
Why don't you fetch me
my brother's saddlebag

1467
01:30:59,341 --> 01:31:00,675
from inside the saloon?

1468
01:31:02,545 --> 01:31:04,278
I best be getting on home.

1469
01:31:15,491 --> 01:31:22,398
[tranquil music playing]

1470
01:31:33,875 --> 01:31:38,848
