1
00:00:02,143 --> 00:00:05,363
In the name of Jesus Christ!

2
00:00:06,026 --> 00:00:08,921
In the name of Jesus Christ!

3
00:00:18,184 --> 00:00:20,383
Jesus!

4
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:25,052
Jesus! Jesus!

5
00:00:36,943 --> 00:00:38,446
A dream?

6
00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:40,453
Yes.

7
00:00:42,141 --> 00:00:45,721
I was dreaming
of your mother's bread...

8
00:00:45,762 --> 00:00:48,814
still warm from the oven.

9
00:00:49,283 --> 00:00:51,415
Keep dreaming
if you want to eat today.

10
00:00:55,339 --> 00:00:57,898
Nothing to eat
and sleeping on stones.

11
00:00:57,938 --> 00:01:00,497
I'm getting too old forthis.

12
00:01:00,538 --> 00:01:02,446
We must find work.

13
00:02:47,021 --> 00:02:50,701
Let me be the first
to welcome you, Governor Pilate.

14
00:02:50,741 --> 00:02:53,041
You appear to be
the only one to welcome me.

15
00:02:53,077 --> 00:02:54,883
Please make note of that,
Governor.

16
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,692
I am the only one
to welcome you.

17
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:59,591
A conqueror doesn't expect
a warm welcome.

18
00:02:59,627 --> 00:03:02,185
These people don't accept that
they've been conquered.

19
00:03:02,227 --> 00:03:03,404
Well, they will.

20
00:03:03,444 --> 00:03:06,170
Judea is the most troublesome
province in the empire.

21
00:03:06,208 --> 00:03:08,306
So I've been told.

22
00:03:17,348 --> 00:03:18,592
And who are you?

23
00:03:18,631 --> 00:03:21,156
I am Livio, Roman citizen.

24
00:03:22,284 --> 00:03:23,923
And why are you here?

25
00:03:23,963 --> 00:03:27,250
Well, a kind man would say
I am Caesar's historian.

26
00:03:27,287 --> 00:03:30,474
An unkind man would say
that I am Caesar's...

27
00:03:30,512 --> 00:03:31,859
spy.

28
00:03:34,395 --> 00:03:37,380
( laughs )

29
00:03:56,465 --> 00:03:59,517
- Good morning, Mary.
- It's a beautiful morning.

30
00:03:59,559 --> 00:04:02,049
Have Joseph
and your son returned?

31
00:04:02,093 --> 00:04:04,001
No.

32
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:07,188
I'm sure they must have
found carpentry work in Jerusalem.

33
00:04:07,227 --> 00:04:09,258
God willing.

34
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:12,356
God willing.

35
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:17,412
Pontius Pilate!
Most honored citizen of Rome!

36
00:05:17,451 --> 00:05:21,984
I, Herod Antipas,
Tetrarch of Galilee, welcome you.

37
00:05:22,026 --> 00:05:24,820
( applauding )

38
00:05:24,855 --> 00:05:27,222
I accept your welcome,
Herod Antipas.

39
00:05:27,258 --> 00:05:31,263
And Caesar sends
his blessings on your land,

40
00:05:31,306 --> 00:05:33,505
and his kingdom.

41
00:05:34,465 --> 00:05:36,866
May I present my wife,
Herodias,

42
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:39,335
my stepdaughter, Salome,

43
00:05:39,369 --> 00:05:43,218
and your fellow
Roman citizen, Livio.

44
00:05:43,252 --> 00:05:44,632
We've met.

45
00:05:44,668 --> 00:05:46,665
Please, come sit beside me.

46
00:05:50,394 --> 00:05:54,771
I must say,
this city surprises me.

47
00:05:54,804 --> 00:05:56,644
In what way, Governor?

48
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:59,239
The structures,
they are most impressive.

49
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,344
Built by my father,

50
00:06:01,386 --> 00:06:04,146
Herod the Great,
beloved of his people.

51
00:06:04,183 --> 00:06:06,416
They hated him.

52
00:06:08,593 --> 00:06:10,624
A vicious man, I'm told.

53
00:06:12,345 --> 00:06:16,250
How distasteful of you
to speak of my father this way.

54
00:06:16,294 --> 00:06:19,155
As his son,
I am a hero to the people.

55
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:21,389
The butt of all of their jokes.

56
00:06:21,428 --> 00:06:23,234
You misunderstand.

57
00:06:23,271 --> 00:06:27,120
In Rome, we call yourfather's
way of ruling, "statesmanship."

58
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:48,247
Perhaps Pontius Pilate
would like to see

59
00:06:48,281 --> 00:06:51,366
the grandest of all structures
in lsrael, the Temple,

60
00:06:51,408 --> 00:06:54,729
built by my father,
a personal friend of Augustus,

61
00:06:54,764 --> 00:06:58,153
as I am a personal
friend of Tiberius.

62
00:06:59,523 --> 00:07:01,958
How strange.

63
00:07:01,992 --> 00:07:04,124
I've never
heard him mention you.

64
00:07:05,909 --> 00:07:08,108
I thank you
for your welcome.

65
00:07:08,147 --> 00:07:10,245
And I will visit the Temple,
as you suggest.

66
00:07:10,285 --> 00:07:15,088
Make sure you take your troops!
And show their insignia proudly!

67
00:07:16,834 --> 00:07:19,135
Livio,

68
00:07:19,171 --> 00:07:22,189
whatdoes he mean,
"show their insignia"?

69
00:07:22,232 --> 00:07:24,262
Well, I could tell you,

70
00:07:24,306 --> 00:07:27,358
but it would spoil all the fun.

71
00:08:03,961 --> 00:08:07,046
The High Priest of the Temple
is Caiaphas, appointed by Rome,

72
00:08:07,088 --> 00:08:09,578
which puts him in
a very interesting position

73
00:08:09,622 --> 00:08:12,673
on the one hand he has to appear
to be on the side of his own people,

74
00:08:12,715 --> 00:08:16,328
but on the other hand
he owes his position to Rome...

75
00:08:16,368 --> 00:08:18,466
a very narrow path to tread.

76
00:08:18,507 --> 00:08:22,087
Welcome, Pontius Pilate.

77
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:24,853
I am Caiaphas,

78
00:08:24,892 --> 00:08:27,944
High Priest of this Temple.

79
00:08:27,985 --> 00:08:30,285
We come to wish you well,

80
00:08:30,322 --> 00:08:34,956
as you undertake the post
of Governor of Judea.

81
00:08:34,995 --> 00:08:37,228
I thank you, priest.

82
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:41,272
Allow me
to get right to the point.

83
00:08:41,314 --> 00:08:43,771
Rome is displeased
with the number of legions

84
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:47,260
it has to keep in this barren land
in orderto maintain peace.

85
00:08:47,304 --> 00:08:50,558
Your taxes don't begin
to pay back the costs.

86
00:08:50,594 --> 00:08:52,008
You speak of the past.

87
00:08:52,042 --> 00:08:54,588
This disorder erupts directly
from your corrupt religion,

88
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:57,424
which erupts directly
from this Temple.

89
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:59,199
That ends today.

90
00:08:59,238 --> 00:09:01,369
My soldiers will be posted here

91
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:04,136
every minute of every day
from now on.

92
00:09:04,174 --> 00:09:05,779
This order defiles the Temple!

93
00:09:05,819 --> 00:09:08,714
Our religion forbids graven images
in the Temple!

94
00:09:08,749 --> 00:09:11,442
Your soldiers are an abomination
to the Temple.

95
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:14,431
Even their flags break our laws.

96
00:09:14,474 --> 00:09:16,606
We allow no graven images,

97
00:09:16,647 --> 00:09:19,407
and your banners carrying
the carvings of Caesar,

98
00:09:19,445 --> 00:09:23,585
these shields are symbols
of Roman dominion!

99
00:09:25,302 --> 00:09:27,602
No building in Judea,
not even the Temple,

100
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:30,040
is exempt from the display
of these symbols.

101
00:09:30,074 --> 00:09:35,528
What your religion forbids,
Rome demands!

102
00:09:45,049 --> 00:09:48,403
We submit to yours words.

103
00:10:03,216 --> 00:10:05,247
Here is my bare neck!

104
00:10:06,769 --> 00:10:08,733
Let Rome cut it!

105
00:10:12,792 --> 00:10:16,607
We will die before we allow
the Temple to be defiled.

106
00:10:35,462 --> 00:10:37,268
Governor...

107
00:10:38,523 --> 00:10:41,384
an awful lot of blood
for your first day.

108
00:10:41,419 --> 00:10:43,192
Are you sure
Rome would be happy...

109
00:10:43,229 --> 00:10:45,989
if you were to murder
every priest in the Temple?

110
00:11:43,529 --> 00:11:46,715
Mary, stop staring
at Jesus like that.

111
00:11:46,754 --> 00:11:49,413
He will never finish that door.

112
00:11:49,452 --> 00:11:52,044
We do love when the carpenters
arrive, don't we, Mary?

113
00:11:52,085 --> 00:11:56,484
Because there is nothing worse
than a door that squeaks.

114
00:11:56,528 --> 00:11:57,875
Is there anything else that squeaks?

115
00:11:58,668 --> 00:12:01,989
There is one thing that's broken,
but it's beyond repair.

116
00:12:03,604 --> 00:12:05,545
I can repair most things.

117
00:12:06,993 --> 00:12:08,957
A broken heart?

118
00:12:14,892 --> 00:12:16,855
Martha,
you've embarrassed Mary.

119
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:19,166
And you've enchanted her.

120
00:12:19,203 --> 00:12:21,334
She's a beautiful girl.

121
00:12:21,376 --> 00:12:25,516
Woman. She's a woman, Jesus.
And she needs a husband.

122
00:12:26,529 --> 00:12:29,189
Poverty, debt, hunger.

123
00:12:29,228 --> 00:12:32,056
The Romans say
they bring us their world.

124
00:12:32,091 --> 00:12:35,211
All they bring us is misery.
It's misery, Lazarus.

125
00:12:35,251 --> 00:12:37,809
At leastthey let us worship.
The Temple still stands.

126
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:39,881
For now.

127
00:12:39,924 --> 00:12:42,718
But the day may come when they
decide to destroy it too...

128
00:12:42,754 --> 00:12:45,245
destroy us all.

129
00:12:47,724 --> 00:12:49,665
But enough gloom.

130
00:12:49,698 --> 00:12:51,898
Let's see if my son
has done any work

131
00:12:51,936 --> 00:12:54,629
with your sisters
distracting him.

132
00:12:57,959 --> 00:13:00,225
So, are we finished?

133
00:13:00,263 --> 00:13:03,517
Yes, "we" are almost finished,
not that you had much to do with it.

134
00:13:03,554 --> 00:13:05,787
I'm the aging supervisor.

135
00:13:05,825 --> 00:13:09,370
It's my job
to sit back and watch.

136
00:13:09,412 --> 00:13:11,779
Yes, well,
you do it very well.

137
00:13:11,815 --> 00:13:15,697
Lazarus tells me that we will be
paid highly for these repairs.

138
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:18,748
Lazarus has never paid anyone
"highly" for anything.

139
00:13:18,791 --> 00:13:20,563
I heard that snide remark
from my sister.

140
00:13:20,602 --> 00:13:23,261
Joseph and Jesus
are our blood relatives.

141
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:26,655
Do you really think that I would
let them work without pay?

142
00:13:26,689 --> 00:13:29,517
The truth, Lazarus?
You will pay them nothing!

143
00:13:29,553 --> 00:13:31,494
Mary and l
have worked all day

144
00:13:31,527 --> 00:13:34,321
to pay them
in food and wine at dinner.

145
00:13:34,358 --> 00:13:36,883
And so,
they shall be paid-- highly.

146
00:13:54,658 --> 00:13:56,363
No, no...
It is enough.

147
00:13:56,403 --> 00:14:00,308
Don't be proud. You worked,
I pay my debts.

148
00:14:03,742 --> 00:14:06,760
Thank you,
thank you so much.

149
00:14:08,349 --> 00:14:10,874
Thank you again, Lazarus.

150
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:12,689
-Jesus?
- Yes?

151
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:18,973
Mary's had an offer of marriage
from a boy here in Bethany.

152
00:14:19,012 --> 00:14:20,953
I thought you'd like to know.

153
00:14:22,139 --> 00:14:25,067
She loves you.
Surely you must know this.

154
00:14:27,437 --> 00:14:30,265
Why do you treat her as if
her feelings mean nothing to you?

155
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,825
- Lazarus, of course they do.
- Then tell her!

156
00:14:32,867 --> 00:14:34,775
Mary!

157
00:14:48,664 --> 00:14:51,559
Lazarus just told me.

158
00:14:51,594 --> 00:14:54,747
It's not my idea.
You know that--

159
00:14:54,785 --> 00:14:56,558
Mary...

160
00:14:56,595 --> 00:14:57,908
please.

161
00:15:02,981 --> 00:15:05,348
I wish that...

162
00:15:05,382 --> 00:15:09,130
I wish you could understand.

163
00:15:09,168 --> 00:15:11,434
I feel that-- I feel that l...

164
00:15:11,471 --> 00:15:13,928
Have a safe journey, Jesus.

165
00:15:13,894 --> 00:15:16,845
( knocking )
Open the door!

166
00:15:19,719 --> 00:15:21,166
Get out of the way!

167
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,871
Where is your husband?

168
00:15:27,915 --> 00:15:29,721
He's working in Judea.

169
00:15:29,757 --> 00:15:32,158
He's in the hills hiding,

170
00:15:32,192 --> 00:15:36,535
Like the other men,
to escape paying their taxes.

171
00:15:39,005 --> 00:15:42,753
Right, you owe one third
of your income for two years.

172
00:15:42,789 --> 00:15:45,056
You were deferred last year...

173
00:15:45,094 --> 00:15:48,179
but no longer.

174
00:15:52,453 --> 00:15:54,192
Take the goat.

175
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:56,923
Oh, please no!
We won't have milk!

176
00:15:58,574 --> 00:16:00,739
The rest is due
when I come back

177
00:16:00,779 --> 00:16:02,877
through this stinking village
next month.

178
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,874
If I had been here,

179
00:16:08,907 --> 00:16:11,802
I would have thrown
that traitor out into the street.

180
00:16:11,837 --> 00:16:13,475
Joseph,
no one could have done better.

181
00:16:13,516 --> 00:16:16,926
A Jew,
working for the Romans!

182
00:16:16,971 --> 00:16:19,338
He should be ashamed.
Ashamed!

183
00:16:19,373 --> 00:16:21,965
Come and eat.
Please, come and eat.

184
00:16:23,849 --> 00:16:28,775
To think I've lived all this time,
and itonly gets worse.

185
00:16:27,818 --> 00:16:29,658
When?

186
00:16:29,694 --> 00:16:33,633
When will there be an end
to the suffering of our people?

187
00:16:33,677 --> 00:16:36,111
Are you asking me?

188
00:16:38,614 --> 00:16:41,239
Are you telling me that I can
end the suffering?

189
00:16:58,063 --> 00:16:59,409
When will he act?

190
00:16:59,446 --> 00:17:02,004
He will know when it is time.

191
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:03,734
How will he know?

192
00:17:03,777 --> 00:17:06,571
Joseph, stop talking like this.

193
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:34,544
Two days ago, we saw
a farmer leaving his house,

194
00:17:34,581 --> 00:17:37,476
losing everything he's worked for.

195
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:40,001
We're not going to lose everything.

196
00:17:40,044 --> 00:17:43,197
God will provide for us.
For him, too.

197
00:17:44,441 --> 00:17:46,281
Mother,

198
00:17:46,317 --> 00:17:48,382
I know what Father wants.

199
00:17:49,872 --> 00:17:52,431
- I know he thinks I should--
- He thinks...

200
00:17:52,472 --> 00:17:56,579
you should do
what your heart tells you.

201
00:17:59,317 --> 00:18:01,751
Come back inside, please.

202
00:18:07,413 --> 00:18:11,553
Joseph! Joseph!
Come, come, Jesus! Come!

203
00:18:11,593 --> 00:18:14,847
Father, are you all right?
What happened?

204
00:18:14,883 --> 00:18:18,294
Jesus...

205
00:18:18,339 --> 00:18:20,673
Yes, I'm here.
What is it?

206
00:18:21,729 --> 00:18:24,130
I've loved you.

207
00:18:24,165 --> 00:18:28,731
I've loved you... as my own.

208
00:18:31,425 --> 00:18:33,299
...as my...

209
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:43,035
Joseph, no!

210
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:47,941
( wailing )

211
00:19:28,808 --> 00:19:32,454
Father, this is too heavy.

212
00:19:36,344 --> 00:19:39,856
Now, when I am in the most need,
you take him from me?

213
00:19:43,452 --> 00:19:47,065
You want me to step out,
but you leave me alone.

214
00:19:47,106 --> 00:19:50,001
How can you ask this of me?

215
00:19:51,154 --> 00:19:54,767
Alone? I have never been
without him.

216
00:20:03,186 --> 00:20:06,698
You can give him back to me.

217
00:20:08,419 --> 00:20:10,686
You can do it now.

218
00:20:17,141 --> 00:20:19,575
Give him back to me!

219
00:20:19,608 --> 00:20:21,280
Now!

220
00:20:22,538 --> 00:20:26,420
Give him to me!
I am in need!

221
00:20:26,454 --> 00:20:28,889
I cannot walk
this road alone!

222
00:20:28,922 --> 00:20:32,176
Raise him,
raise him up into my arms.

223
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:36,666
Let it be your will, Father.

224
00:20:39,105 --> 00:20:41,865
I cannot do this alone!

225
00:20:43,088 --> 00:20:45,152
Raise him.

226
00:20:47,465 --> 00:20:49,900
Raise him!

227
00:21:11,753 --> 00:21:13,716
It's all in the hands.

228
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,879
Mine are not as talented as his.

229
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,220
Jesus, he loved you.

230
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:24,807
I disappointed him.

231
00:21:24,851 --> 00:21:26,982
He thought he disappointed you.

232
00:21:27,023 --> 00:21:28,862
How?

233
00:21:28,899 --> 00:21:31,199
He knew you had
a Father in Heaven.

234
00:21:31,235 --> 00:21:33,726
Joseph is my father.

235
00:21:39,825 --> 00:21:42,687
Thirty-one years ago
I had to tell Joseph something

236
00:21:42,721 --> 00:21:44,988
that just broke his heart.

237
00:21:44,979 --> 00:21:48,390
An angel?

238
00:21:54,787 --> 00:21:56,986
An... angel?

239
00:22:11,974 --> 00:22:15,823
I am a religious man, Mary.
Don't blaspheme.

240
00:22:15,857 --> 00:22:19,011
It is the truth, Joseph.

241
00:22:25,405 --> 00:22:28,760
Out of all the places in the world...

242
00:22:28,795 --> 00:22:31,780
all the women in the world,
God found you,

243
00:22:31,823 --> 00:22:34,841
in this little village?

244
00:22:36,364 --> 00:22:39,585
Just...

245
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:43,634
just an angel.

246
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:46,928
Just an angel...

247
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:10,375
I think he thought I was crazy.

248
00:23:10,417 --> 00:23:12,291
He did not think you were crazy.

249
00:23:12,326 --> 00:23:14,267
He used to tell me
that story all the time.

250
00:23:14,301 --> 00:23:17,229
He thought he was crazy when
an angel appeared to him in his dream.

251
00:23:18,415 --> 00:23:19,626
No.

252
00:23:19,665 --> 00:23:21,932
He loved you with all his heart.

253
00:23:21,968 --> 00:23:26,737
And he loved you
as if you were his own.

254
00:23:29,965 --> 00:23:32,130
I was his own.

255
00:23:35,002 --> 00:23:37,201
Now it's time for you to go
and find the answers you need.

256
00:23:38,391 --> 00:23:41,016
And leave you alone?

257
00:23:41,057 --> 00:23:43,816
It is what your Father asks of you.

258
00:23:59,454 --> 00:24:02,640
You've given me so much joy.

259
00:24:41,619 --> 00:24:43,650
We heard about Joseph.

260
00:24:48,201 --> 00:24:50,332
How was the journey?

261
00:24:51,953 --> 00:24:54,152
It was long.

262
00:24:56,298 --> 00:24:58,205
A loss to us all.

263
00:24:58,239 --> 00:25:01,526
Yes, thank you, Martha.
Could I have a moment with Mary?

264
00:25:01,563 --> 00:25:04,020
Certainly. Come, brother.

265
00:25:13,629 --> 00:25:16,355
- Mary.
- Jesus.

266
00:25:17,248 --> 00:25:19,021
There's something I must tell you.

267
00:25:21,593 --> 00:25:25,969
You see, my father's death
has ended my life as I knew it.

268
00:25:29,096 --> 00:25:31,530
And it's time now
that I find my way.

269
00:25:34,263 --> 00:25:36,889
Where is your way?

270
00:25:38,397 --> 00:25:40,203
I can't be with you.

271
00:25:49,982 --> 00:25:52,540
- What have I done?
- My life is not my own.

272
00:25:52,582 --> 00:25:54,545
What have I done
to turn you away?

273
00:25:54,589 --> 00:25:57,315
It is not you.

274
00:25:59,362 --> 00:26:02,941
- You love someone else.
- No, no.

275
00:26:02,981 --> 00:26:05,248
I am not who you think I am.

276
00:26:05,285 --> 00:26:07,877
I know who you are.

277
00:26:07,918 --> 00:26:11,239
And I know you love me
as I love you.

278
00:26:11,274 --> 00:26:13,474
Mary, listen to me.
You must live your life...

279
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:19,261
without me.

280
00:27:11,722 --> 00:27:12,732
Jesus!

281
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:18,497
Whatever it is...

282
00:27:18,534 --> 00:27:20,139
you have to do...

283
00:27:21,924 --> 00:27:23,798
safe journey.

284
00:27:42,483 --> 00:27:44,918
( Man shouting )
We stand here.

285
00:27:44,951 --> 00:27:47,442
on the banks of the Jordan River

286
00:27:47,486 --> 00:27:52,749
where the people of lsrael
once crossed so triumphantly

287
00:27:52,785 --> 00:27:57,812
in their God driven
wanderings toward freedom!

288
00:27:57,852 --> 00:28:00,837
( laughs )

289
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,978
Look at us today!

290
00:28:03,875 --> 00:28:07,880
Our leaders are weak and sinful.

291
00:28:07,923 --> 00:28:11,435
They fail to keep the spirit of
the Covenant

292
00:28:11,477 --> 00:28:13,418
of the letter of the law.

293
00:28:13,452 --> 00:28:16,470
The prophet lsaiah said,

294
00:28:16,513 --> 00:28:20,395
"Wash yourselves...

295
00:28:22,239 --> 00:28:25,683
make yourself clean...

296
00:28:28,491 --> 00:28:31,084
remove the evil of your doings,

297
00:28:31,125 --> 00:28:34,020
learn to do good."

298
00:28:36,818 --> 00:28:40,207
Who will be baptized here today,

299
00:28:40,241 --> 00:28:43,494
to show the world that he is cleansed?

300
00:28:43,532 --> 00:28:46,943
Baptist, cleanse me.

301
00:28:46,987 --> 00:28:53,955
Come. All who wish to
be baptized will be cleansed.

302
00:28:53,998 --> 00:28:56,657
Forthe Baptism signifies

303
00:28:56,696 --> 00:29:00,736
that your commitment
has already been made...

304
00:29:00,777 --> 00:29:03,897
to hate injustice,

305
00:29:03,936 --> 00:29:07,290
and fight the battle
of the righteous ones.

306
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:14,960
I baptize you with
water for repentance.

307
00:29:16,443 --> 00:29:19,237
( laughing )

308
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:25,493
What's the matter, John?

309
00:29:25,533 --> 00:29:27,631
Don't you recognize
your own relatives?

310
00:29:30,897 --> 00:29:33,849
Jesus?
You are unrecognizable.

311
00:29:33,892 --> 00:29:36,585
I am?
Look at yourself.

312
00:29:36,624 --> 00:29:38,924
I'm a prophet,
crying out in the wilderness!

313
00:29:39,948 --> 00:29:41,912
Yes, and properly dressed for it!

314
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:51,031
- Come, sit.
-Thank you.

315
00:29:51,072 --> 00:29:53,103
Eat with us.

316
00:29:53,145 --> 00:29:58,139
This man is my blood,
my family--Jesus, of Nazareth.

317
00:29:58,180 --> 00:29:59,683
Thank you, John.

318
00:29:59,727 --> 00:30:02,094
How long has it been?

319
00:30:03,972 --> 00:30:05,419
Twenty years?

320
00:30:06,835 --> 00:30:08,282
How are you?

321
00:30:09,238 --> 00:30:11,931
What are
you doing now?

322
00:30:11,970 --> 00:30:15,291
How are Joseph and Mary?

323
00:30:15,326 --> 00:30:17,268
Joseph has recently died.

324
00:30:17,301 --> 00:30:20,656
I'm sorry.

325
00:30:21,534 --> 00:30:24,059
Mother is well.

326
00:30:24,101 --> 00:30:26,535
I am a carpenter.

327
00:30:27,491 --> 00:30:29,432
Joseph would be proud.

328
00:30:30,781 --> 00:30:33,935
Actually, Joseph
wanted me to move on,

329
00:30:33,974 --> 00:30:37,127
to serve my God,
as you are, John.

330
00:30:37,416 --> 00:30:40,603
You are welcome here, Jesus.

331
00:30:41,399 --> 00:30:43,239
Thank you.

332
00:30:45,216 --> 00:30:47,381
Joseph was a good man.

333
00:30:49,166 --> 00:30:51,331
He taught us both a lot.

334
00:30:53,181 --> 00:30:55,941
Remember our first trip to Jerusalem?

335
00:30:56,965 --> 00:30:58,839
Of course. Passover.

336
00:31:37,222 --> 00:31:41,991
This is the Holy Temple,
and tomorrow we will go inside.

337
00:31:42,028 --> 00:31:47,750
But tonight, tonight help me
make our camp, maybe there.

338
00:31:47,787 --> 00:31:49,234
Come.

339
00:32:36,647 --> 00:32:39,732
Look, isn't it beautiful?

340
00:33:06,294 --> 00:33:09,122
Through those doors is the Sanctuary.

341
00:33:09,158 --> 00:33:12,019
If you look closely maybe you'll
see the golden menorah.

342
00:33:12,054 --> 00:33:16,553
At the back of the Sanctuary,
is the inner most chamber,

343
00:33:16,596 --> 00:33:18,829
the Holy of Holies.

344
00:33:24,889 --> 00:33:27,256
( praying )

345
00:33:55,549 --> 00:33:58,769
Mary! We must go...

346
00:33:58,806 --> 00:34:00,220
if we are to reach home
before dark tomorrow.

347
00:34:00,254 --> 00:34:02,162
I can't find Jesus.

348
00:34:02,196 --> 00:34:04,002
He's probably gone ahead with John.

349
00:34:04,039 --> 00:34:07,091
So we're leaving now.

350
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:09,955
- Come, Mary.
- I'm coming. I'm coming.

351
00:34:09,996 --> 00:34:12,229
Let's go, then.

352
00:34:12,267 --> 00:34:15,128
- Mary!
- I'm coming, Joseph!

353
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:31,446
He's not there.
No one has seen him.

354
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:33,517
- John?
- He's asleep.

355
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:36,219
They haven't seen
Jesus since Jerusalem.

356
00:34:36,258 --> 00:34:38,525
You said he was with them.

357
00:34:38,562 --> 00:34:42,411
- Yes, I thought he was.
- Well, he's not.

358
00:34:43,334 --> 00:34:46,723
Look here!
I'll start on the streets.

359
00:34:46,757 --> 00:34:48,103
If you find him, wait here!

360
00:34:48,139 --> 00:34:50,440
- "lf"?
- When! Jesus!

361
00:34:52,089 --> 00:34:54,052
Jesus!

362
00:34:53,828 --> 00:34:57,082
Excuse me,
did you see a little boy...?

363
00:35:12,091 --> 00:35:14,986
The prophets tell us that this city
and this place

364
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:17,050
will be a light to all
the people of the earth,

365
00:35:17,094 --> 00:35:19,461
because everyone
will keep the Torah.

366
00:35:19,495 --> 00:35:22,188
The Messiah will
be the prince of peace.

367
00:35:22,228 --> 00:35:24,628
The prophet lsaiah says,

368
00:35:24,663 --> 00:35:26,660
"They shall beat their
swords into plowshares,

369
00:35:26,704 --> 00:35:29,004
and their spears
into pruning tools.

370
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,834
Nation shall not lift
up sword against nation,

371
00:35:31,870 --> 00:35:35,157
neither shall they
learn war anymore."

372
00:35:38,715 --> 00:35:41,610
Your mother and I have been
looking for you for three days!

373
00:35:41,644 --> 00:35:44,045
Three days!

374
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:46,043
Child, why have
you treated us like this?

375
00:35:46,088 --> 00:35:48,916
Why were you searching for me?

376
00:35:48,951 --> 00:35:51,318
Didn't you know I would be
in my Father's house?

377
00:35:54,927 --> 00:35:57,553
Your Father's house, yes.

378
00:36:30,339 --> 00:36:33,986
Did you see the men hanging
from the crosses on the way back?

379
00:36:35,966 --> 00:36:38,726
Terrible memory.

380
00:36:41,397 --> 00:36:44,449
The Romans got so bored
at crucifying men,

381
00:36:44,490 --> 00:36:49,551
they started doing it upside down,
justto entertain themselves.

382
00:36:54,898 --> 00:36:56,862
John...

383
00:36:58,287 --> 00:37:01,372
will you baptize me?

384
00:37:02,731 --> 00:37:05,592
If you confess your sins...

385
00:37:05,626 --> 00:37:09,172
and dedicate your life to God.

386
00:37:09,214 --> 00:37:10,683
Of course.

387
00:37:16,191 --> 00:37:23,462
Jesus of Nazareth, I baptize
you with water for repentance.

388
00:37:34,357 --> 00:37:36,129
( thunderclap )

389
00:37:47,838 --> 00:37:50,430
Behold...

390
00:37:50,471 --> 00:37:53,063
the Lamb of God.

391
00:38:50,947 --> 00:38:53,247
Jesus...

392
00:38:59,076 --> 00:39:00,915
Jesus.

393
00:39:05,296 --> 00:39:07,461
The Spirit has
brought you to me.

394
00:39:08,291 --> 00:39:10,389
Do you know why?

395
00:39:11,187 --> 00:39:13,386
To be tested.

396
00:39:13,425 --> 00:39:15,489
The Spirit has led you here

397
00:39:15,531 --> 00:39:17,663
and has allowed you
to know what men feel

398
00:39:17,703 --> 00:39:20,295
when they are being
tested by me.

399
00:39:20,336 --> 00:39:25,004
But to do this you
must give up every privilege.

400
00:39:25,931 --> 00:39:28,366
You must be like them
in every way,

401
00:39:28,399 --> 00:39:31,484
as fragile, alone
and little as they are.

402
00:39:31,526 --> 00:39:34,421
Give up your shield.

403
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:39,190
Abandon the protection
of the power that abides in you.

404
00:39:39,227 --> 00:39:42,907
Empty yourself of your divinity.

405
00:39:42,945 --> 00:39:47,153
Empty yourself of
the Father, Jesus.

406
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:12,413
Without the protection
of the Father?

407
00:40:12,449 --> 00:40:16,264
You know it is necessary.
The Spirit tells you, not me.

408
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:19,846
Only in this way
can we challenge each other.

409
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:23,537
I am willing.

410
00:40:23,573 --> 00:40:27,288
( screaming )

411
00:40:33,775 --> 00:40:36,636
Welcome to life, Jesus.

412
00:40:51,567 --> 00:40:53,272
You don't look so good, Jesus.

413
00:40:53,311 --> 00:40:55,937
- Are you hungry?
- Yes.

414
00:40:58,412 --> 00:41:05,875
Command these stones
to become loaves of bread.

415
00:41:07,792 --> 00:41:10,844
You mean call upon
my Father's power?

416
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:13,219
You have the power to
command these stones, don't you?

417
00:41:14,736 --> 00:41:16,149
I am only his Son.

418
00:41:16,184 --> 00:41:18,944
But you have the power!
( laughs )

419
00:41:23,589 --> 00:41:26,978
And if I use it in this
way I will fail his mission.

420
00:41:27,012 --> 00:41:29,637
He has asked me to bring his
word to man,

421
00:41:29,677 --> 00:41:31,842
not to crush them with his power.

422
00:41:32,441 --> 00:41:34,876
I'm jus tasking for bread

423
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:37,962
to relieve your hunger, Jesus.

424
00:41:38,003 --> 00:41:41,650
Men have hungers.

425
00:41:44,388 --> 00:41:47,867
Feed your starving people, Jesus.

426
00:41:49,390 --> 00:41:51,724
Man does not live by bread alone,

427
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,993
but by every word that
comes from the mouth of God.

428
00:41:54,031 --> 00:41:57,746
You're missing the point, Jesus.

429
00:41:57,783 --> 00:42:01,262
You have the power
to solve mankind's problems.

430
00:42:01,304 --> 00:42:04,389
Feed these people.
Many are starving.

431
00:42:04,431 --> 00:42:07,415
- You can feed them.
- I was sent to feed them the truth.

432
00:42:07,458 --> 00:42:10,184
- They hunger for bread, Jesus.
- No, they die of hunger,

433
00:42:10,223 --> 00:42:13,342
because of hearts of stone of
other men, not because God wills it.

434
00:42:13,382 --> 00:42:16,433
And you can change all that.

435
00:42:17,167 --> 00:42:18,049
And so they are to listen to you, hmm?

436
00:42:18,083 --> 00:42:19,991
A peasant from Nazareth?

437
00:42:20,025 --> 00:42:25,939
You and only you have
the truth... sent from God?

438
00:42:25,981 --> 00:42:28,416
Others have spoken the truth.

439
00:42:29,470 --> 00:42:33,016
And men have destroyed
all of them for a thousand years.

440
00:42:33,057 --> 00:42:38,477
Butyou... you, they will
listen to, hmm? Why?

441
00:42:40,692 --> 00:42:42,106
They will.

442
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:45,091
And just how
will you do that, Jesus?

443
00:42:45,136 --> 00:42:48,648
How will you get them
to listen to you?

444
00:42:48,690 --> 00:42:50,956
So, I'm going to help you.

445
00:43:29,454 --> 00:43:32,843
There is but one way
to make them notice you, Jesus.

446
00:43:32,876 --> 00:43:35,244
You must convince them
that you are sent by God.

447
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:37,905
Throw yourself down and he
will command his angels to catch you.

448
00:43:37,944 --> 00:43:41,882
Then they will see that
you are someone to listen to.

449
00:43:43,045 --> 00:43:45,245
They would listen then,
wouldn't they?

450
00:43:45,283 --> 00:43:49,098
They would listen to
someone who could do that.

451
00:43:50,154 --> 00:43:52,554
That's not my Father's will.

452
00:43:52,589 --> 00:43:55,484
If he wanted me simply to test
his laws, nature's laws,

453
00:43:55,518 --> 00:43:58,537
he would not have sent me.

454
00:43:58,579 --> 00:44:01,474
Don't test God
for your own purposes.

455
00:44:02,199 --> 00:44:05,060
Jesus of Nazareth,
Jesus of Jerusalem,

456
00:44:05,096 --> 00:44:07,688
Jesus of Egypt, Jesus of Bethany,
Jesus of Bethlehem.

457
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:09,826
- Where else have you been, Jesus?
- Nowhere.

458
00:44:09,867 --> 00:44:11,999
No.

459
00:44:12,039 --> 00:44:14,799
So, you cannot understand
the stakes!

460
00:44:14,725 --> 00:44:16,565
Let me show you.

461
00:44:26,672 --> 00:44:31,867
Power, Jesus, power!

462
00:44:31,905 --> 00:44:35,058
Not second in command,
but number one.

463
00:44:35,097 --> 00:44:37,756
You have never felt that power.
I have.

464
00:44:37,795 --> 00:44:40,129
You've never been able to
until now.

465
00:44:40,165 --> 00:44:43,520
Now you can be number one.

466
00:44:46,516 --> 00:44:48,075
Do you know what
that means, Jesus?

467
00:44:49,026 --> 00:44:50,372
No.

468
00:44:50,408 --> 00:44:52,708
Power is what every man wants

469
00:44:52,744 --> 00:44:54,775
more than anything else
in the world.

470
00:44:54,818 --> 00:44:56,815
They kill for it.

471
00:44:56,858 --> 00:45:01,425
There is nothing more precious,
and it is yours to have.

472
00:45:03,243 --> 00:45:04,162
How?

473
00:45:05,909 --> 00:45:12,282
Bow down to me, Jesus, just once.

474
00:45:12,326 --> 00:45:16,006
In all of existence,
before and aftertime,

475
00:45:16,045 --> 00:45:18,704
just once, Jesus.

476
00:45:18,744 --> 00:45:22,682
It's a small price.
Consider the reward.

477
00:45:24,569 --> 00:45:26,274
Away with you, Satan!

478
00:45:26,313 --> 00:45:28,803
For it is written,
"Worship the Lord, your God,

479
00:45:28,847 --> 00:45:31,506
and serve only Him."

480
00:45:31,545 --> 00:45:34,171
I will not create a human kingdom

481
00:45:34,211 --> 00:45:38,588
by becoming the most powerful,
but by being the poorest.

482
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:43,486
For I am the Lamb of God.

483
00:45:43,525 --> 00:45:46,577
See you again, Jesus.

484
00:45:46,618 --> 00:45:49,075
It's only just begun.

485
00:46:10,774 --> 00:46:13,075
Do you think he's coming?

486
00:46:13,111 --> 00:46:15,175
Hmm?

487
00:46:18,212 --> 00:46:21,601
If he's been out there
all this time he hasn't survived.

488
00:46:21,635 --> 00:46:24,361
If he hasn't survived,
he isn't who we thought he was.

489
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:27,092
Go home if that's
what you want.

490
00:46:38,057 --> 00:46:40,257
Do you think he really is the one?

491
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:48,108
It's him!

492
00:46:48,148 --> 00:46:50,179
Rabbi!

493
00:46:50,222 --> 00:46:52,252
Rabbi!

494
00:46:52,295 --> 00:46:54,494
Why do you call me this?

495
00:46:54,533 --> 00:46:56,171
We were there, Rabbi,
when you were baptized.

496
00:46:56,212 --> 00:46:57,984
And John the Baptist
called you the Lamb of God.

497
00:46:58,022 --> 00:46:59,896
You are the Messiah.

498
00:46:59,930 --> 00:47:01,770
Are you sure?

499
00:47:01,806 --> 00:47:03,870
- Yes!
- No.

500
00:47:05,064 --> 00:47:07,263
( laughing )

501
00:47:08,702 --> 00:47:10,800
How did you find me?

502
00:47:10,841 --> 00:47:12,905
John the Baptist told
us where your mother lives.

503
00:47:15,482 --> 00:47:17,647
What do you want?

504
00:47:17,686 --> 00:47:19,594
To be your followers.

505
00:47:26,704 --> 00:47:29,138
Rabbi, where are you staying?

506
00:47:29,172 --> 00:47:30,911
Come and see.

507
00:47:39,111 --> 00:47:40,917
Oh, Jesus...!

508
00:47:59,103 --> 00:48:01,695
How long have I been sleeping?

509
00:48:01,736 --> 00:48:04,990
Two nights and one full day.

510
00:48:06,771 --> 00:48:09,464
I was dreaming of this bed,

511
00:48:09,502 --> 00:48:11,342
this house.

512
00:48:11,378 --> 00:48:12,949
Joseph was here.

513
00:48:24,102 --> 00:48:26,997
Those two young men
waiting for you...

514
00:48:27,030 --> 00:48:29,028
what do they want?

515
00:48:29,071 --> 00:48:30,541
( chuckles )

516
00:48:32,626 --> 00:48:34,073
To be my followers.

517
00:48:36,377 --> 00:48:37,880
Good.

518
00:48:38,351 --> 00:48:40,808
Maybe I'm not ready, Mother.

519
00:49:04,186 --> 00:49:07,137
In Bethlehem,

520
00:49:07,182 --> 00:49:09,908
in that stable behind the inn,

521
00:49:09,945 --> 00:49:12,740
kings came to bow down to you,

522
00:49:12,776 --> 00:49:15,402
carrying precious gifts--

523
00:49:15,442 --> 00:49:19,381
frankincense, myrrh, and gold.

524
00:49:29,001 --> 00:49:33,108
Those men did not travel all that way,
following that star,

525
00:49:33,148 --> 00:49:36,334
without the will of God guiding them.

526
00:49:40,462 --> 00:49:42,200
What's this?

527
00:49:45,925 --> 00:49:49,314
This is beautiful.
Did you make this?

528
00:49:49,347 --> 00:49:52,399
It is a wedding present
for your cousin, Benjamin.

529
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:54,841
Little Benjamin is getting married?

530
00:49:54,876 --> 00:49:56,783
Yes.

531
00:49:56,818 --> 00:49:58,523
Let's go!

532
00:49:58,562 --> 00:50:00,334
And your followers?

533
00:50:05,342 --> 00:50:07,013
Friends!

534
00:50:07,053 --> 00:50:08,994
We're going to a wedding.

535
00:50:35,816 --> 00:50:39,462
- The Baptist said he is the one.
- That's not enough.

536
00:50:39,502 --> 00:50:41,689
If you do not approve
of my son,

537
00:50:41,727 --> 00:50:43,691
why do you follow him?

538
00:50:45,413 --> 00:50:48,005
Our people are slaves to Rome.

539
00:50:48,047 --> 00:50:52,019
Our freedom fighters are being killed
and this is how he spends his time?

540
00:50:52,062 --> 00:50:54,003
- He is a man.
- Yes...

541
00:50:54,037 --> 00:50:56,527
and I fear, nothing more.

542
00:50:58,434 --> 00:50:59,881
We are fishermen.

543
00:50:59,914 --> 00:51:02,315
Our brothers are working right now
on the Lake of Galilee.

544
00:51:02,349 --> 00:51:03,629
We should be there
working with them.

545
00:51:03,666 --> 00:51:05,663
What for?
To make money?

546
00:51:05,707 --> 00:51:07,648
Life has gotto be
more than that.

547
00:51:07,681 --> 00:51:10,767
We went looking for answers,
and we met him.

548
00:51:10,808 --> 00:51:12,772
And you follow him?

549
00:51:12,815 --> 00:51:14,723
- Should we?
- Yes.

550
00:51:14,757 --> 00:51:15,969
Why?

551
00:51:16,422 --> 00:51:18,689
I am so thirsty.

552
00:51:18,726 --> 00:51:21,027
I shall fetch you wine.

553
00:51:22,083 --> 00:51:24,248
What's the matter, Andrew?
You don't dance?

554
00:51:24,288 --> 00:51:25,825
I'll dance...

555
00:51:25,867 --> 00:51:28,268
when lsrael is free
and men are honest.

556
00:51:28,304 --> 00:51:30,537
That will be
a very slow dance.

557
00:51:30,574 --> 00:51:32,212
( laughing )

558
00:51:34,029 --> 00:51:36,194
It will not come a tall
if we wait for you.

559
00:51:36,235 --> 00:51:37,974
I thought when I found
John the Baptist that--

560
00:51:38,012 --> 00:51:39,459
Andrew!

561
00:51:39,493 --> 00:51:43,431
But he said
you were the one.

562
00:51:43,475 --> 00:51:46,920
And you spend your time
drinking wine and dancing!

563
00:51:47,787 --> 00:51:50,221
There is no wine left.

564
00:51:50,254 --> 00:51:53,834
Andrew, I'm sorry
I have disappointed you.

565
00:51:56,047 --> 00:51:58,314
- I was only--
-Jesus?

566
00:51:58,350 --> 00:52:00,684
There is no wine left.

567
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:03,054
Yes, Mother,
what concern is that to me?

568
00:52:03,089 --> 00:52:06,769
Perhaps you could provide...?

569
00:52:09,001 --> 00:52:11,267
My hour has not yet come.

570
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:14,325
It is time.

571
00:52:26,585 --> 00:52:28,357
Jesus will help you
with the wine.

572
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:30,336
There is no wine left.

573
00:52:31,159 --> 00:52:33,123
Just do exactly
what Jesus says.

574
00:52:36,359 --> 00:52:38,918
Andrew needs to know.

575
00:52:38,959 --> 00:52:40,698
The world needs to know.

576
00:52:48,772 --> 00:52:52,126
Could you please fill those jugs
over there with water?

577
00:52:52,162 --> 00:52:54,462
- With water?
- Yes, with water.

578
00:52:54,498 --> 00:52:56,170
- Yes.
- Thank you.

579
00:53:01,476 --> 00:53:03,966
Jesus, the jars are filled.

580
00:53:23,566 --> 00:53:26,158
Draw some out and
take it to the bride groom.

581
00:53:35,051 --> 00:53:36,993
Impossible.

582
00:53:41,667 --> 00:53:43,631
Drink, Andrew.

583
00:53:43,674 --> 00:53:46,468
The cup you desired is here.

584
00:53:56,608 --> 00:53:59,133
He is the one, Andrew.

585
00:54:00,655 --> 00:54:03,976
Have no fear
in following him.

586
00:54:14,313 --> 00:54:17,174
Anyone who has two coats...

587
00:54:17,210 --> 00:54:20,958
must share with those
who have none!

588
00:54:20,994 --> 00:54:25,135
Anyone with food,
must do likewise!

589
00:54:25,174 --> 00:54:26,845
Tax collector!

590
00:54:28,070 --> 00:54:32,076
Collect no more taxes
than those prescribed for you!

591
00:54:42,589 --> 00:54:46,067
Herod! Antipas!
Come out!

592
00:54:47,459 --> 00:54:49,916
Herod Antipas!

593
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:53,708
Ruler of these people,
come out!

594
00:55:01,710 --> 00:55:04,728
I have heard from the corners
of lsrael of you, John,

595
00:55:04,770 --> 00:55:07,429
son of Zachariah.

596
00:55:07,469 --> 00:55:09,836
And I've come
to hear your message.

597
00:55:09,871 --> 00:55:12,564
You must repent,
Herod Antipas,

598
00:55:12,603 --> 00:55:16,912
for the sins that you have
committed to your people!

599
00:55:16,947 --> 00:55:21,088
I come in peace, John.
What "sins" do you speak of

600
00:55:21,126 --> 00:55:24,313
You live in sin
with this woman, Herodias!

601
00:55:24,352 --> 00:55:26,124
Hold your tongue, "prophet"!

602
00:55:26,162 --> 00:55:29,382
You are married to his brother,
and yet you lay with him!

603
00:55:29,420 --> 00:55:32,349
You're a liar!
He's a filthy liar!

604
00:55:50,382 --> 00:55:52,582
I want to hear
your words, John,

605
00:55:52,620 --> 00:55:55,077
but I cannot allow you
to insult my wife.

606
00:56:00,121 --> 00:56:04,093
You are a sinner! Put away this woman!
Confess your sins!

607
00:56:04,136 --> 00:56:06,694
Arrest this liar!

608
00:56:06,736 --> 00:56:08,205
We're leaving.

609
00:56:08,250 --> 00:56:10,875
- No...
- Salome!

610
00:56:13,916 --> 00:56:16,968
You can turn your back on me,
Herod Antipas,

611
00:56:17,009 --> 00:56:18,849
but not on God's judgement!

612
00:56:18,885 --> 00:56:20,949
Go.

613
00:56:20,992 --> 00:56:27,803
Beware, one who comes after me
will cleanse with fire!

614
00:56:56,923 --> 00:56:59,324
James!

615
00:56:59,358 --> 00:57:01,725
Simon!
We're back!

616
00:57:06,599 --> 00:57:08,730
You go off
without saying anything,

617
00:57:08,771 --> 00:57:10,543
leave me to do
all the fishing.

618
00:57:10,580 --> 00:57:12,522
It's a good thing
James was here.

619
00:57:12,555 --> 00:57:14,260
We've found him!

620
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:17,128
Now you return,
grinning like an idiot.

621
00:57:18,512 --> 00:57:21,440
- Can't you feel it?
- All I feel is wet.

622
00:57:22,824 --> 00:57:24,698
Can't you feel his presence?

623
00:57:24,732 --> 00:57:28,514
Are you possessed?
What are you talking about, Andrew?

624
00:57:28,549 --> 00:57:31,669
Look... there.
The Messiah!

625
00:57:41,234 --> 00:57:42,939
Have you gone mad, too?

626
00:57:46,072 --> 00:57:47,878
The quiet one is James.

627
00:57:47,915 --> 00:57:49,879
The loud one
at the stern is Simon.

628
00:57:49,922 --> 00:57:52,940
Have you been telling my brother
that you're the Messiah?

629
00:57:52,983 --> 00:57:55,742
- Are you a rabbi?
- He's a carpenter.

630
00:57:55,780 --> 00:57:58,047
Where are you from?

631
00:57:58,084 --> 00:57:59,654
Nazareth.

632
00:58:01,671 --> 00:58:05,284
- Nazareth?
- Yes, Nazareth.

633
00:58:05,325 --> 00:58:08,051
Can anything good
come from Nazareth?

634
00:58:08,089 --> 00:58:09,369
( laughing )

635
00:58:08,405 --> 00:58:10,211
Your boat is empty.

636
00:58:10,249 --> 00:58:13,761
We've been working all night
while these two followed you around,

637
00:58:13,802 --> 00:58:15,800
searching for...

638
00:58:15,843 --> 00:58:18,738
Whatexactly was it
you were searching for?

639
00:58:21,932 --> 00:58:24,332
If you took me out
I could fill your nets.

640
00:58:32,496 --> 00:58:34,560
Climb aboard, "Messiah."

641
00:58:35,260 --> 00:58:37,852
The "Messiah" is going
to fill our boat.

642
00:58:43,784 --> 00:58:46,309
Where are the fish, "Messiah"?

643
00:58:46,351 --> 00:58:48,550
Further out, where it's deep.

644
00:58:48,589 --> 00:58:52,068
- Ha, that's original!
- Simon, he's the one.

645
00:58:52,110 --> 00:58:53,613
I've seen him
change water into wine.

646
00:58:53,657 --> 00:58:55,564
Really?

647
00:58:55,599 --> 00:58:57,371
Andrew,
scoop up some lake water,

648
00:58:57,409 --> 00:58:59,181
I could use a cup of wine.

649
00:58:59,219 --> 00:59:01,283
Scoop up one for me, too.

650
00:59:04,439 --> 00:59:05,909
Cast your nets here.

651
00:59:05,953 --> 00:59:08,118
Now.

652
00:59:08,158 --> 00:59:10,121
James...

653
00:59:25,173 --> 00:59:27,473
I'm only going to do this

654
00:59:27,509 --> 00:59:30,696
so you won't waste your life
following this jackal.

655
00:59:38,587 --> 00:59:40,225
What do you think, James?

656
00:59:40,266 --> 00:59:42,666
Should we drag the net,
or just let it sink?

657
00:59:42,701 --> 00:59:44,866
I don't know.

658
00:59:44,906 --> 00:59:49,047
Ask the carpenter,
he knows everything about fish!

659
00:59:49,974 --> 00:59:51,444
Pull it in.

660
00:59:51,488 --> 00:59:53,721
Pull it in?
It's only been in the water--

661
00:59:53,759 --> 00:59:55,105
Pull it in.

662
00:59:55,832 --> 00:59:57,997
Of course.
James, pull it in.

663
01:00:18,145 --> 01:00:20,670
Stop laughing and help us!

664
01:00:25,320 --> 01:00:27,261
What kind of man are you,

665
01:00:27,295 --> 01:00:29,000
that you can command
the fish in the water?

666
01:00:29,421 --> 01:00:31,878
Come with me, Peter...

667
01:00:31,923 --> 01:00:34,290
I'll make you a fisher of men.

668
01:00:37,122 --> 01:00:38,962
My name is Simon.

669
01:00:51,273 --> 01:00:51,923
Wait, wait, wait!

670
01:00:51,965 --> 01:00:54,455
Is it all right if we drink
from your well?

671
01:00:54,499 --> 01:00:56,069
-Thanks.
- Yes.

672
01:01:00,772 --> 01:01:04,654
You are from Nazareth, yes?

673
01:01:04,688 --> 01:01:07,583
I saw you at the wedding
in Canaan.

674
01:01:07,617 --> 01:01:09,883
They said you made
the wine from water.

675
01:01:09,921 --> 01:01:11,885
Is that true?
Did you do that?

676
01:01:11,928 --> 01:01:14,026
Yes, he did that.
He changed the water into wine.

677
01:01:14,067 --> 01:01:16,401
- I saw it.
- I saw it.

678
01:01:19,103 --> 01:01:21,661
This is the one.
Jesus of Nazareth.

679
01:01:21,703 --> 01:01:24,003
He changed the water into wine!

680
01:01:37,039 --> 01:01:39,204
Sir...

681
01:01:39,244 --> 01:01:41,342
man of Nazareth.

682
01:01:41,384 --> 01:01:45,850
If you can do that,
can you heal my son?

683
01:01:47,274 --> 01:01:49,473
Come.

684
01:01:49,512 --> 01:01:52,340
Please, I beg of you.

685
01:01:57,641 --> 01:01:58,752
Wait!

686
01:01:58,793 --> 01:02:01,588
This man is a fraud
and a false Messiah!

687
01:02:01,623 --> 01:02:03,620
Believe.
He is the chosen one!

688
01:02:03,664 --> 01:02:05,863
He comes here
to steal your money!

689
01:02:05,902 --> 01:02:09,189
Yes!
Every week the same thing!

690
01:02:11,134 --> 01:02:12,940
( angry clamor )

691
01:02:13,058 --> 01:02:15,818
Quiet! Quiet!
Listen to the Master.

692
01:02:18,916 --> 01:02:20,857
Do you believe I can help you?

693
01:02:22,207 --> 01:02:23,587
Yes.

694
01:02:52,715 --> 01:02:54,982
( outcry )

695
01:03:17,122 --> 01:03:19,388
Rise up and walk!

696
01:04:33,507 --> 01:04:35,448
( weeping )

697
01:04:43,412 --> 01:04:46,207
He's the Messiah.

698
01:04:46,732 --> 01:04:49,099
- Did he really do that?
- You saw it!

699
01:04:49,135 --> 01:04:52,254
Yes, I saw it,
but I don't believe it.

700
01:04:52,294 --> 01:04:55,615
Believe it! Believe it!

701
01:04:55,650 --> 01:04:58,276
- What's your name?
-Thomas.

702
01:04:58,316 --> 01:05:00,481
Come with us, Thomas.

703
01:05:00,521 --> 01:05:02,720
Follow the Messiah.
Come!

704
01:05:22,241 --> 01:05:24,609
I have given you
your wish.

705
01:05:24,644 --> 01:05:26,877
He can speak
against you no more.

706
01:05:26,916 --> 01:05:30,821
You fill your palace
with graven images,

707
01:05:30,865 --> 01:05:33,760
and you forget your God!

708
01:05:33,958 --> 01:05:36,886
Cut out his tongue
and feed it to the dogs!

709
01:05:43,009 --> 01:05:45,534
Live by the Word of God!

710
01:06:03,367 --> 01:06:05,398
Oh! Roman pig!

711
01:06:09,456 --> 01:06:11,262
Open the door.

712
01:06:11,298 --> 01:06:13,396
Caesar comes
to collect his taxes.

713
01:06:15,774 --> 01:06:19,589
"Caesar" comes?
My, how the mighty have fallen.

714
01:06:19,625 --> 01:06:21,790
- Your taxes are due.
- Have you no shame?

715
01:06:21,829 --> 01:06:25,544
You, a Jew,
doing Rome's dirty work?

716
01:06:25,581 --> 01:06:26,995
Your taxes are at work,

717
01:06:27,029 --> 01:06:28,060
building and repairing roads,
aqueducts--

718
01:06:28,104 --> 01:06:30,168
And they are lining
your pockets!

719
01:06:30,209 --> 01:06:31,814
Do you wish to pay,

720
01:06:31,855 --> 01:06:33,661
or do you wish to have
these men take you away?

721
01:06:40,708 --> 01:06:42,806
( laughing )

722
01:06:51,950 --> 01:06:53,263
Zealots.

723
01:07:08,768 --> 01:07:10,440
Zealots!

724
01:07:10,479 --> 01:07:12,846
Zealots! They're coming!

725
01:08:06,446 --> 01:08:08,544
Stop! Stop!

726
01:08:08,586 --> 01:08:10,460
Who says this?

727
01:08:10,495 --> 01:08:12,695
- Jesus of Nazareth!
- Oh, yes...

728
01:08:12,733 --> 01:08:15,594
the latest "Messiah."
I've heard of you.

729
01:08:15,629 --> 01:08:18,524
Will you save
your people, "Messiah"?

730
01:08:18,557 --> 01:08:19,837
Spilling blood
won't save them.

731
01:08:19,874 --> 01:08:22,600
Spilling enough
Roman blood will.

732
01:08:22,639 --> 01:08:24,445
The stones of Israel
are covered with blood,

733
01:08:24,481 --> 01:08:26,848
still we are enslaved.
You will change nothing

734
01:08:26,884 --> 01:08:29,812
until you remove the blood
from your hands.

735
01:08:38,995 --> 01:08:40,869
I am Barabbas.

736
01:08:40,904 --> 01:08:42,845
Maybe you need
a bit of blood on you.

737
01:08:44,064 --> 01:08:46,195
No! No!

738
01:08:46,236 --> 01:08:48,603
Do you love me now,
"Messiah"?

739
01:08:50,119 --> 01:08:54,159
This is what Rome does
to your people, every day.

740
01:08:55,220 --> 01:08:57,184
Strike me again.

741
01:08:57,227 --> 01:08:59,427
And when you have
exhausted yourself--

742
01:08:59,465 --> 01:09:01,406
When I have exhausted myself

743
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:03,897
there will be
legions more to strike.

744
01:09:03,941 --> 01:09:08,182
- Exactly! When does it stop?
- When we are free.

745
01:09:08,220 --> 01:09:10,351
You will be free
when you learn to love.

746
01:09:10,392 --> 01:09:13,679
Clever words.
Nothing more.

747
01:09:13,716 --> 01:09:18,058
Don't fill my people with your
empty promises, "Messiah."

748
01:09:20,495 --> 01:09:23,187
I'll be the one to
free the people of lsrael,

749
01:09:23,227 --> 01:09:24,966
Jesus of Nazareth!

750
01:09:25,004 --> 01:09:27,204
And I'll do it with a sword.

751
01:09:49,431 --> 01:09:51,529
You cry over Roman blood?

752
01:09:51,570 --> 01:09:53,534
Human life!

753
01:09:53,577 --> 01:09:55,978
Romans are not human.

754
01:09:59,074 --> 01:10:01,475
Your hate will only
harm you, friend.

755
01:10:01,509 --> 01:10:05,324
Hate can be a useful weapon,
used correctly...

756
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:06,593
and I'm not your friend.

757
01:10:06,630 --> 01:10:08,594
Wait...

758
01:10:11,863 --> 01:10:15,252
Is your lsrael free
now that these men are dead?

759
01:10:15,285 --> 01:10:16,598
No.

760
01:10:18,017 --> 01:10:19,723
Then follow me.

761
01:10:22,987 --> 01:10:25,915
I will show you
how to be free.

762
01:10:25,949 --> 01:10:27,754
I am the way.

763
01:10:31,037 --> 01:10:32,450
You!

764
01:10:34,130 --> 01:10:36,038
Tax collector!

765
01:10:37,916 --> 01:10:40,014
What is your name?

766
01:10:40,054 --> 01:10:43,600
Levi, son of Alphaeus.

767
01:10:43,641 --> 01:10:46,233
Well, now your name
is now Matthew.

768
01:10:47,427 --> 01:10:50,681
Do you wish to kill
this collector of Caesar's taxes?

769
01:10:53,876 --> 01:10:56,041
Follow me, Matthew.

770
01:10:56,082 --> 01:10:57,652
Where?

771
01:10:57,694 --> 01:10:59,692
To your home.

772
01:11:05,724 --> 01:11:09,079
Come Judas,
son of Simon lscariot.

773
01:11:11,056 --> 01:11:12,930
Your fate is with me.

774
01:11:17,572 --> 01:11:19,872
How did he know my name?

775
01:11:19,908 --> 01:11:22,960
Follow him,
and find out.

776
01:11:24,184 --> 01:11:25,956
( chattering )

777
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:49,127
This food...

778
01:11:49,162 --> 01:11:51,429
it was bought
with stolen money.

779
01:11:51,467 --> 01:11:54,059
I told him that!

780
01:11:56,041 --> 01:11:58,600
Bless you.

781
01:11:58,641 --> 01:12:01,761
Matthew, thank you
for your hospitality.

782
01:12:02,282 --> 01:12:04,054
Rabbi, why do you do this?

783
01:12:04,092 --> 01:12:06,392
Do what?

784
01:12:06,428 --> 01:12:08,526
Eat with me...

785
01:12:08,568 --> 01:12:10,531
a tax collector.

786
01:12:10,575 --> 01:12:13,200
Don't you see
how they hate me?

787
01:12:14,655 --> 01:12:16,192
And they are right.

788
01:12:16,235 --> 01:12:18,894
I despise myself.

789
01:12:20,053 --> 01:12:21,692
Why?

790
01:12:21,731 --> 01:12:24,390
I steal from them...

791
01:12:26,601 --> 01:12:27,914
from all of them.

792
01:12:27,952 --> 01:12:30,352
Then stop.

793
01:12:32,493 --> 01:12:35,713
Give back everything,
and come with me.

794
01:12:37,219 --> 01:12:39,127
It's simple.

795
01:12:42,485 --> 01:12:45,212
James, Peter,
you're not eating.

796
01:12:45,249 --> 01:12:47,280
It's very good.

797
01:12:48,639 --> 01:12:52,286
I'm trying to love him, Rabbi.
I really am.

798
01:12:56,077 --> 01:12:58,018
Keep trying, Peter.

799
01:12:58,052 --> 01:12:59,296
Keep trying.

800
01:13:08,684 --> 01:13:11,871
( drums and cymbals )

801
01:13:31,853 --> 01:13:34,411
Happy birthday, my King.

802
01:14:23,753 --> 01:14:25,358
( cheering )

803
01:14:30,368 --> 01:14:32,960
Wonderful, Salome!
Delightful!

804
01:14:33,001 --> 01:14:35,268
A gift, worthy of a gift.

805
01:14:38,036 --> 01:14:39,641
Give her
whatever she wants!

806
01:14:39,681 --> 01:14:41,846
I hope it's me!

807
01:14:41,887 --> 01:14:42,841
( laughing )

808
01:14:47,811 --> 01:14:49,842
Whatever you want.

809
01:14:49,884 --> 01:14:52,969
I pledge it
to you tonight, Salome.

810
01:14:54,163 --> 01:14:55,834
Anything?

811
01:14:55,874 --> 01:14:58,005
Anything.

812
01:14:58,046 --> 01:15:00,177
( cheering )

813
01:15:05,220 --> 01:15:07,677
Come now,
that's not fair, Salome.

814
01:15:07,722 --> 01:15:10,908
Your mother's desires
are far too expensive.

815
01:15:10,947 --> 01:15:12,484
( laughter )

816
01:15:17,582 --> 01:15:19,983
Anything?

817
01:15:22,091 --> 01:15:25,636
Now, my dear,
it's just a dance.

818
01:15:25,678 --> 01:15:28,573
You promised!
"Anything", you said!

819
01:15:28,606 --> 01:15:30,873
Pay up, Herod Antipas!

820
01:15:41,265 --> 01:15:43,071
Anything.

821
01:15:56,996 --> 01:15:59,588
I want the head
of John the Baptist.

822
01:16:08,942 --> 01:16:10,412
But, my dear--

823
01:16:10,456 --> 01:16:12,790
Will you not rid me
of this vermin?!

824
01:16:23,678 --> 01:16:25,317
Bring me the head
of John the Baptist.

825
01:16:28,384 --> 01:16:30,449
On a platter!

826
01:16:46,781 --> 01:16:48,812
I forgive you.

827
01:16:48,854 --> 01:16:51,547
I will live again
in the kingdom of heaven.

828
01:18:32,335 --> 01:18:34,175
( drumming and clapping )

829
01:19:05,969 --> 01:19:07,147
Water!

830
01:19:07,187 --> 01:19:09,061
Andrew, friends, come.
Water!

831
01:19:22,325 --> 01:19:23,335
Andrew...!

832
01:19:25,913 --> 01:19:27,449
( laughter )

833
01:19:36,511 --> 01:19:38,844
( screaming and shouting )

834
01:19:43,059 --> 01:19:44,506
Adulteress!

835
01:19:45,922 --> 01:19:48,054
Shame on you, adulteress!

836
01:19:56,421 --> 01:19:57,924
Caiaphas!

837
01:20:03,562 --> 01:20:05,526
All right, all right.

838
01:20:05,722 --> 01:20:07,663
Jared...

839
01:20:09,013 --> 01:20:11,941
I've heard this Joseph of Nazareth,
has just entered the city.

840
01:20:11,975 --> 01:20:14,735
"Jesus" of Nazareth.
Only moments ago.

841
01:20:14,772 --> 01:20:17,297
Is this the one who claims
to be the Messiah?

842
01:20:17,340 --> 01:20:20,560
He is one of the ones
who claims this, my lord.

843
01:20:20,597 --> 01:20:23,459
Good.
Take the girl to him,

844
01:20:23,493 --> 01:20:26,422
and ask this "Messiah"
to judge her.

845
01:20:26,455 --> 01:20:27,633
Test him in front of the people.

846
01:20:27,673 --> 01:20:31,578
Show him to be a charlatan,
and they will lose interest.

847
01:20:33,235 --> 01:20:35,636
We have to expose these fakes.

848
01:20:35,670 --> 01:20:36,800
They are dangerous men.

849
01:20:36,875 --> 01:20:38,322
Bring her.

850
01:20:41,186 --> 01:20:44,541
The kingdom of heaven
is like a treasure,

851
01:20:44,576 --> 01:20:47,010
buried in a field.

852
01:20:47,045 --> 01:20:48,514
And when you find this treasure--

853
01:20:48,559 --> 01:20:50,264
( angry voices )

854
01:20:50,303 --> 01:20:51,873
Stone the adulteress!

855
01:20:54,351 --> 01:20:57,077
Adulteress!
She's an adulteress!

856
01:20:57,115 --> 01:20:58,888
Teacher!

857
01:21:00,703 --> 01:21:04,810
This woman was caught in the act
of committing adultery.

858
01:21:04,849 --> 01:21:08,293
In the law, Moses commands us
to stone such women.

859
01:21:08,338 --> 01:21:10,930
What do you say, Teacher?

860
01:21:10,970 --> 01:21:13,371
They are baiting him.
It's a trap.

861
01:21:45,987 --> 01:21:49,735
I was told you preach
according to the law of Moses.

862
01:21:49,772 --> 01:21:52,263
Do you have an answer,
Nazarene?

863
01:21:57,472 --> 01:22:01,018
Let anyone among you
who is without sin...

864
01:22:01,304 --> 01:22:03,795
be the first to cast their stone.

865
01:22:06,734 --> 01:22:08,765
( crowd murmurs )

866
01:22:48,373 --> 01:22:50,707
There is no man here
who condemns you?

867
01:22:51,960 --> 01:22:53,800
No one, my lord.

868
01:22:53,836 --> 01:22:55,609
Neither do l.

869
01:23:00,386 --> 01:23:02,293
Go your way.

870
01:23:02,328 --> 01:23:04,762
And from now on,
do not sin again.

871
01:23:15,254 --> 01:23:17,386
I want to see the Temple.

872
01:23:19,006 --> 01:23:20,914
I'll tell you more tomorrow.

873
01:23:30,776 --> 01:23:32,740
Do you want to come with us?

874
01:23:32,784 --> 01:23:34,130
Where?

875
01:23:34,165 --> 01:23:36,330
Does it matter?

876
01:23:36,371 --> 01:23:37,874
Yes.

877
01:23:37,917 --> 01:23:41,328
I go where I want.
I'm free.

878
01:23:41,768 --> 01:23:44,293
You're not free.

879
01:23:44,335 --> 01:23:46,007
But you could be.

880
01:23:46,047 --> 01:23:48,672
Why don't you come with us?

881
01:23:55,064 --> 01:23:57,723
You treated her like...

882
01:23:57,262 --> 01:24:00,056
Iike she was worth something.

883
01:24:00,804 --> 01:24:02,745
So are you.

884
01:24:08,834 --> 01:24:11,033
( chattering )

885
01:24:14,922 --> 01:24:18,738
Change your coin
to temple currency!

886
01:24:23,052 --> 01:24:25,217
Purest gold!
Pure gold!

887
01:24:27,264 --> 01:24:29,228
I have the best price--

888
01:24:29,272 --> 01:24:31,078
This is my Father's house!

889
01:24:33,386 --> 01:24:36,011
My Father's house
is a house of prayer,

890
01:24:36,052 --> 01:24:39,003
not a house of trade!

891
01:24:41,732 --> 01:24:43,931
We pay tithes,

892
01:24:43,970 --> 01:24:47,090
butthey care more
about Caesar than about God!

893
01:24:49,005 --> 01:24:51,631
They have forgotten
the Word of God!

894
01:24:51,671 --> 01:24:54,891
Do you say that we should not
pay taxes to Rome?

895
01:25:00,656 --> 01:25:02,069
Stop!
That's my money!

896
01:25:02,103 --> 01:25:04,437
Who's image is on this coin?

897
01:25:04,473 --> 01:25:05,976
Caesar!

898
01:25:06,020 --> 01:25:08,679
Then give to Caesar
what is Caesar's,

899
01:25:08,719 --> 01:25:11,176
and give to God
what is God's!

900
01:25:13,161 --> 01:25:15,955
I will make this
the house of God again!

901
01:25:18,992 --> 01:25:21,191
( yelling and protesting )

902
01:25:26,189 --> 01:25:27,400
( cracking )

903
01:25:34,130 --> 01:25:36,924
Get out!
Get out of here!

904
01:25:39,961 --> 01:25:42,755
This is the renewal
of lsrael!

905
01:25:42,791 --> 01:25:45,316
Take these things
out of here!

906
01:25:45,358 --> 01:25:47,265
Take these things
out of here!

907
01:25:47,300 --> 01:25:50,251
Stop making my Father's house
a mocked place!
