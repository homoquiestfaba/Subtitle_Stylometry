♪ Oh, I'll make you better

3
00:00:24,896 --> 00:00:28,999
(Ian) I don't do this a lot.

4
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,275
Neither do I.

5
00:00:33,482 --> 00:00:36,619
So, have you been
doing all right?

6
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:37,895
I'm sorry, that was
a silly question.

7
00:00:37,896 --> 00:00:38,758
Of course not.

8
00:00:38,759 --> 00:00:40,379
No, it's okay.

9
00:00:41,896 --> 00:00:43,655
I've been fine, all
things considered.

10
00:00:45,482 --> 00:00:47,551
Of course, it's hard with
two daughters, and...

11
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:51,343
I still miss him.

12
00:00:51,344 --> 00:00:54,067
It still feels like a
dream that he's dead.

13
00:00:54,068 --> 00:00:55,619
You probably don't
wanna talk about this now.

14
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:58,447
It's actually kind of
nice to talk about it.

15
00:00:58,448 --> 00:01:02,033
It's been over a year, and
no one even says his name.

16
00:01:02,034 --> 00:01:03,654
So...

17
00:01:03,655 --> 00:01:05,309
Wish I knew him
better, you know?

18
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:06,826
I wish I got to know you better.

19
00:01:06,827 --> 00:01:09,619
I mean, we barely spoke
in high school, right?

20
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:11,067
Yeah.

21
00:01:11,068 --> 00:01:12,550
Crazy how we bumped
into each other.

22
00:01:12,551 --> 00:01:14,619
Well, you two probably
would've been friends.

23
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:16,136
Mm.

24
00:01:16,137 --> 00:01:17,724
Yeah, he was a
really great guy.

25
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:22,136
An amazing husband,
a wonderful father.

26
00:01:22,137 --> 00:01:24,620
(Maya laughs)

27
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:26,620
Wow.

28
00:01:28,655 --> 00:01:33,172
You know, my mom
died a few years ago,

29
00:01:34,862 --> 00:01:38,655
my father before that, so I
know what you're going through.

30
00:01:39,793 --> 00:01:41,309
Yeah.

31
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:42,861
This is probably
a heavy conversation

32
00:01:42,862 --> 00:01:44,103
for a first date, right?

33
00:01:46,068 --> 00:01:47,103
(laughs) Just a little.

34
00:01:48,413 --> 00:01:50,343
So I'll see you at
church on Sunday, right?

35
00:01:50,344 --> 00:01:51,344
Yes.

36
00:01:54,137 --> 00:01:57,793
But I've got a babysitter
until midnight.

37
00:01:59,655 --> 00:02:01,274
Oh, okay.

38
00:02:01,275 --> 00:02:04,688

get to hang out with you

39
00:02:04,689 --> 00:02:05,862

00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,793

I can't do this anymore.

00:03:25,172 --> 00:03:26,758
Okay, I will.

Nope.

Don't wanna hear it.

00:03:45,482 --> 00:03:46,827
Ian, I have had enough.

73
00:03:47,793 --> 00:03:48,965
I'm done.

74
00:03:49,689 --> 00:03:51,205
Maya, I'm not the only
one who's fallen apart.

75
00:03:51,206 --> 00:03:52,723
You've fallen apart too.

76
00:03:52,724 --> 00:03:54,447
You've struggled and
I've helped you, baby,

77
00:03:54,448 --> 00:03:55,723
I've helped you get through it.

78
00:03:55,724 --> 00:03:57,004
Are you gonna
go there with me?

79
00:03:58,344 --> 00:04:01,033
I was depressed because
I lost my husband,

80
00:04:01,034 --> 00:04:02,861
but I got my life together.

81
00:04:02,862 --> 00:04:05,826
You, on the other hand,
can't seem to do that.

82
00:04:05,827 --> 00:04:06,827
Baby, all right,
look, look, look.

83
00:04:06,828 --> 00:04:08,999
I just need a little
more time, okay?

84
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,171
I'll go to the program.

85
00:04:10,172 --> 00:04:11,000
I'll go get help, baby.

86
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:12,067
I want to be better.

87
00:04:12,068 --> 00:04:13,516
I just need a little more time.

88
00:04:13,517 --> 00:04:16,171
I told you I am done.

89
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:18,586
What part don't you understand?

90
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,895
Baby, look, I, I love you.

91
00:04:21,896 --> 00:04:24,102
I love you, and I
love your kids, baby.

92
00:04:24,103 --> 00:04:25,413
Look at me.

93
00:04:26,275 --> 00:04:27,964
Baby, I want to be
a real family, okay?

94
00:04:27,965 --> 00:04:31,412
There's nothing more that I
want than a real family, okay?

95
00:04:31,413 --> 00:04:32,930
I'm, I'm going to
go to the program.

96
00:04:32,931 --> 00:04:33,896
I'm going to get help.

97
00:04:33,896 --> 00:04:34,896
Baby, look at me.

98
00:04:36,344 --> 00:04:37,792
One more chance, that's it.

99
00:04:37,793 --> 00:04:40,447
Ian, you have
had enough chances.

100
00:04:40,448 --> 00:04:42,723
What else do you want from me?

101
00:04:42,724 --> 00:04:45,274
How many do you
want me to give you?

102
00:04:45,275 --> 00:04:47,585
I have trust you, you
have violated my trust.

103
00:04:47,586 --> 00:04:48,619
What do you want from me?

104
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:50,517
Baby, just one more, okay?

105
00:04:57,344 --> 00:05:01,274
So, I was waiting
for the right moment.

106
00:05:01,275 --> 00:05:02,447
The right moment never came,

107
00:05:02,448 --> 00:05:05,724
so, you know, that's
all, that's all my fault.

108
00:05:07,413 --> 00:05:09,034
Love you so much.

109
00:05:10,482 --> 00:05:12,965
I'm sorry for everything
that I've done.

110
00:05:14,137 --> 00:05:16,999
Maya, I'll go get help, I'll
do whatever I need to do,

111
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,379
but I can't lose you.

112
00:05:19,172 --> 00:05:23,274
I can't.

113
00:05:23,275 --> 00:05:26,896
Baby, I am no good without you.

114
00:05:30,344 --> 00:05:31,655
I'm no good alone, baby.

115
00:05:33,413 --> 00:05:35,827
We've been through
so much, so much.

116
00:05:37,413 --> 00:05:39,034
Baby, please don't
give up on me now.

117
00:05:42,931 --> 00:05:43,931
Please.

118
00:05:48,448 --> 00:05:50,724
You don't make me regret this.

119
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:54,620
One more chance.

120
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,585
But you have to promise me,

121
00:06:00,586 --> 00:06:03,826
promise me no more drinking
and no more gambling.

122
00:06:03,827 --> 00:06:04,827
I mean it.

123
00:06:05,827 --> 00:06:06,827
Okay.

124
00:06:08,827 --> 00:06:09,827
I'm serious.

125
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:17,448
(kissing)

126
00:06:27,724 --> 00:06:28,999
Mama.

127
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,309
Mama?

128
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:31,378
Mama!

129
00:06:31,379 --> 00:06:32,724
Oh, God, baby.

130
00:06:33,965 --> 00:06:34,999
What's wrong?

131
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,517
You wouldn't wake up.

132
00:06:37,413 --> 00:06:38,724
Oh, Mommy's so sorry.

133
00:06:39,724 --> 00:06:41,034
I must have overslept again.

134
00:06:42,965 --> 00:06:44,654
Look, why don't
you head downstairs

135
00:06:44,655 --> 00:06:46,620
and I'll meet you
in a minute, yeah?

136
00:06:47,896 --> 00:06:48,896
Can I have a kiss?

137
00:06:50,241 --> 00:06:52,136
(Maya kisses)

138
00:06:52,137 --> 00:06:53,896
You got on my favorite PJs.

139
00:06:55,379 --> 00:06:57,896
(Maya laughs)

140
00:06:59,655 --> 00:07:00,655
Ow.

141
00:07:04,241 --> 00:07:05,241
Ow.

142
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:07,620
Noelle, Grace!

143
00:07:14,034 --> 00:07:15,205
(ominous music)

144
00:07:15,206 --> 00:07:16,861
(Ian) Maya.

145
00:07:16,862 --> 00:07:20,067
Oh my God, Ian, you scared me.

146
00:07:20,068 --> 00:07:21,585
What are you doing home?

147
00:07:21,586 --> 00:07:22,757
I left work early.

148
00:07:22,758 --> 00:07:24,102
I decided to take a shower here.

149
00:07:24,103 --> 00:07:25,895
What, what are you doing?

150
00:07:25,896 --> 00:07:28,000
I don't know, what does
it look like I'm doing?

151
00:07:29,241 --> 00:07:30,412
It looks like you've lost it.

152
00:07:30,413 --> 00:07:31,688
Funny.

153
00:07:31,689 --> 00:07:33,619
No, the nanny starts today,

154
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:36,619
so I figured a little extra
security couldn't hurt.

155
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:39,654
You know, since Mama's going
back to work full time,

156
00:07:39,655 --> 00:07:41,620
she needs to keep an
eye on her babies.

157
00:07:43,724 --> 00:07:45,792
I get that, but, baby,
you worry too much.

158
00:07:45,793 --> 00:07:47,654
All right?

159
00:07:47,655 --> 00:07:49,481
Come on now, you stay with
a cop, you live with a cop.

160
00:07:49,482 --> 00:07:51,895
Not to mention the sexiest
cop in the district.

161
00:07:51,896 --> 00:07:54,205
Oh my God.

162
00:07:54,206 --> 00:07:55,585
I'm all the security you need.

163
00:07:55,586 --> 00:07:57,309
Girl, what do you
think she's gonna pull?

164
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,481
Well, first of all, she
was the only nanny available,

165
00:07:59,482 --> 00:08:01,205
so that's telling you a lot.

166
00:08:01,206 --> 00:08:05,102
And I've never left a
stranger with the kids before.

167
00:08:05,103 --> 00:08:06,619
Right, I get that,

168
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,378
but you're still
worrying too much.

169
00:08:08,379 --> 00:08:11,343
And that looks a little creepy.

170
00:08:11,344 --> 00:08:12,964
That doesn't look creepy.

171
00:08:12,965 --> 00:08:14,447
Baby, that, that's
a little creepy.

172
00:08:14,448 --> 00:08:16,102
Can you take it down, please?

173
00:08:16,103 --> 00:08:17,205
Fine.

174
00:08:17,206 --> 00:08:18,206
Thanks.

175
00:08:24,275 --> 00:08:25,999
(Maya laughs)

176
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,550
God.

177
00:08:27,551 --> 00:08:28,999
Look, I'm, I'm gonna
go change, okay?

178
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,205
All right.

179
00:08:30,206 --> 00:08:31,723
And promise me one thing?

180
00:08:31,724 --> 00:08:33,516
No more weird stuff, at
least while I'm gone.

181
00:08:33,517 --> 00:08:34,687
It wasn't weird.

182
00:08:34,688 --> 00:08:35,808
No, that was pretty weird.

183
00:08:37,136 --> 00:08:39,412
(kisses) My wife.

184
00:08:39,413 --> 00:08:40,586
I'll be back.

185
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:50,241
(ominous music)

186
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:19,379
(dramatic music)

187
00:09:35,827 --> 00:09:38,688
Hey, and here is the kitchen.

188
00:09:38,689 --> 00:09:40,757
Oh, nice.

189
00:09:40,758 --> 00:09:44,274
And here we have
Noelle, and this is Grace.

190
00:09:44,275 --> 00:09:46,206
Hi, girls.

191
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,826
Hey, Ian.

192
00:09:50,827 --> 00:09:52,171
Ian, this is Elle.

193
00:09:52,172 --> 00:09:53,205
Elle, Ian.

194
00:09:53,206 --> 00:09:54,240
The new babysitter.

195
00:09:54,241 --> 00:09:55,343
Hi, nice to meet you.

196
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:56,654
Nice to meet you.

197
00:09:56,655 --> 00:09:57,757
Have we met before?

198
00:09:57,758 --> 00:09:59,585
I mean, you look familiar.

199
00:09:59,586 --> 00:10:01,516
I don't think we've met,

200
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:04,274
but Maya gave me
the full rundown.

201
00:10:04,275 --> 00:10:05,379
You have a beautiful home.

202
00:10:06,517 --> 00:10:07,517
Thank you.

203
00:10:08,827 --> 00:10:10,861
What's their usual
bedtime routine?

204
00:10:10,862 --> 00:10:12,550
Anything you want me to do?

205
00:10:12,551 --> 00:10:14,102
We don't usually
start bedtime stuff

206
00:10:14,103 --> 00:10:16,861
for another hour or
two, but if you want,

207
00:10:16,862 --> 00:10:18,274
you can go with the
girls to their room

208
00:10:18,275 --> 00:10:20,378
and you guys can get
to know each other.

209
00:10:20,379 --> 00:10:21,826
- Okay.
- Yeah?

210
00:10:21,827 --> 00:10:22,930
All right, girls,
what do you say?

211
00:10:22,931 --> 00:10:23,724
You wanna show me your room?

212
00:10:23,725 --> 00:10:25,274
(Noelle) Yeah.

213
00:10:25,275 --> 00:10:27,205
Noelle and Grace,
such beautiful names.

214
00:10:27,206 --> 00:10:28,206
All right.

215
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:32,723
How's your day?

216
00:10:32,724 --> 00:10:35,379
Oh, don't you mean
how was my morning?

217
00:10:37,034 --> 00:10:39,033
I've been so exhausted lately

218
00:10:39,034 --> 00:10:40,826
that I slept through a
meeting with the principal.

219
00:10:40,827 --> 00:10:42,379
Maybe you shouldn't go in now.

220
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:45,171
Honey.

221
00:10:45,172 --> 00:10:47,412
Look, we agreed that when
the girls were of age,

222
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:48,896
I would go back to work.

223
00:10:49,896 --> 00:10:52,102
You said that you
were okay with that.

224
00:10:52,103 --> 00:10:53,481
I know, baby,

225
00:10:53,482 --> 00:10:55,842
but sometimes I think you put
too much pressure on yourself.

226
00:10:56,689 --> 00:10:58,369
You just need to take
it one day at a time.

227
00:10:59,689 --> 00:11:00,896
Maybe you're right.

228
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:03,378
How's work going?

229
00:11:03,379 --> 00:11:04,792
Mm.

230
00:11:04,793 --> 00:11:06,793
I talked to the Chief today.

231
00:11:08,241 --> 00:11:09,826
And?

232
00:11:09,827 --> 00:11:12,723
And they are promoting
your boy to Lieutenant.

233
00:11:12,724 --> 00:11:15,895
(Maya cheering)
Finally.

234
00:11:15,896 --> 00:11:19,723
(laughs) Oh, baby.

235
00:11:19,724 --> 00:11:21,240
You know, it's
not settled yet.

236
00:11:21,241 --> 00:11:22,999
They still have to push
through some paperwork

237
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,240
and everything, but
it's safe to say

238
00:11:25,241 --> 00:11:27,999
that I will be on my best
behavior for the next few weeks.

239
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,723
Well, you have
nothing to worry about.

240
00:11:30,724 --> 00:11:32,516
(laughs) Oh, boy.

241
00:11:32,517 --> 00:11:35,309
Well, I guess we gotta have
something a little fancier

242
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:38,688
than nuggets to celebrate
that big promotion.

243
00:11:38,689 --> 00:11:41,068
And I could think of
one way to celebrate.

244
00:11:42,689 --> 00:11:46,792
That's right, I have the
perfect present in mind.

245
00:11:46,793 --> 00:11:47,793
A little prince.

246
00:11:49,344 --> 00:11:50,930
A son to carry my name.

247
00:11:50,931 --> 00:11:53,861
Baby, I told you I
am done with diapers.

248
00:11:53,862 --> 00:11:56,136
I have a career that I love
that I wanna get back to,

249
00:11:56,137 --> 00:11:59,034
and here you are trying to
keep me barefoot and pregnant?

250
00:11:59,896 --> 00:12:01,309
Would you stop it?

251
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:02,310
Call me Lieutenant.

252
00:12:02,311 --> 00:12:03,793
No, no, no, no.

253
00:12:06,068 --> 00:12:08,103
Have you been drinking?

254
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:10,827
Oh, gosh.

255
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:12,930
Come on, baby,

256
00:12:12,931 --> 00:12:14,757
it was just one drink with
the guys to celebrate.

257
00:12:14,758 --> 00:12:16,999
And look, now it's our
turn to celebrate, okay?

258
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,655
No.

259
00:12:17,656 --> 00:12:18,723
- Just one drink.
- No.

260
00:12:18,724 --> 00:12:19,964
- Just one.
- No, Ian.

261
00:12:19,965 --> 00:12:22,861
We know how this thing
goes, it's a cycle.

262
00:12:22,862 --> 00:12:24,964
One drink goes to the
next, goes to the next,

263
00:12:24,965 --> 00:12:27,000
and here we are
back at square one.

264
00:12:28,068 --> 00:12:30,412
Baby, you have a big
promotion on the line.

265
00:12:30,413 --> 00:12:31,965
You can't jeopardize it.

266
00:12:35,068 --> 00:12:36,482
Okay.

267
00:12:37,551 --> 00:12:39,344
All right, I'm, I'm sorry.

268
00:12:40,172 --> 00:12:42,517
We just have to find a
safer way to celebrate.

269
00:12:43,896 --> 00:12:45,033
Baby, I already told you.

270
00:12:45,034 --> 00:12:47,274
I can think of another
way we can celebrate.

271
00:12:47,275 --> 00:12:50,240
Come on.

272
00:12:50,241 --> 00:12:51,793
(kissing) Please.

273
00:12:54,517 --> 00:12:56,378
Oh, baby.

274
00:12:56,379 --> 00:12:58,103
Baby, grab a condom.

275
00:12:59,206 --> 00:13:03,412
Ian, honey, come on,
please, grab a condom.

276
00:13:03,413 --> 00:13:05,862
(phone chiming)

277
00:13:10,517 --> 00:13:12,344
You're betting again?

278
00:13:13,724 --> 00:13:17,172
Oh God, I can't believe you.

279
00:13:18,413 --> 00:13:19,792
(Ian) Baby.

280
00:13:19,793 --> 00:13:24,586
♪ Baby, we both just
lit the candle ♪

281
00:13:26,206 --> 00:13:30,965
♪ Place it up, that's
when it's stable ♪

282
00:13:32,034 --> 00:13:36,344
♪ I know the stakes are high

283
00:13:37,931 --> 00:13:42,206
♪ All is fair in
love and strife ♪

284
00:13:42,724 --> 00:13:44,206
♪ Come

285
00:13:51,034 --> 00:13:55,965
(suspenseful music)

286
00:14:27,655 --> 00:14:29,999
(Elle) Oh, coffee's ready.

287
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,275
Thanks, Elle.

288
00:14:34,965 --> 00:14:35,999
(Ian) Morning.

289
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,171
(Maya) Good morning.

290
00:14:38,172 --> 00:14:39,172
Hey.

291
00:14:40,344 --> 00:14:41,999
I gotta make a call
with the principal.

292
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,205
I thought you slept
through that meeting.

293
00:14:44,206 --> 00:14:47,274
Mm-hmm, but he was very
understanding and we rescheduled.

294
00:14:47,275 --> 00:14:49,136
Well, that was nice of him.

295
00:14:49,137 --> 00:14:51,930
Look, I might be late
(kisses) coming home tonight.

296
00:14:51,931 --> 00:14:54,033
They have me out on
patrol all week, okay?

297
00:14:54,034 --> 00:14:55,205
(Maya) All right.

298
00:14:55,206 --> 00:14:56,619
(Ian) So, I'll see you later.

299
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:57,413
Okay, I'll see
you later, babe.

300
00:14:57,414 --> 00:14:58,619
Have a good day.

301
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:00,205
Oh, I can only take one cup.

302
00:15:00,206 --> 00:15:02,378
I can't be late when
I'm up for a promotion.

303
00:15:02,379 --> 00:15:03,275
A promotion?

304
00:15:03,276 --> 00:15:05,343
Well, that's wonderful.

305
00:15:05,344 --> 00:15:07,241
I'll be Lieutenant
any day now.

306
00:15:08,689 --> 00:15:10,861
Well, maybe I shouldn't
get my hopes up too high

307
00:15:10,862 --> 00:15:12,343
until it's official, but...

308
00:15:12,344 --> 00:15:14,274
I'm sure you're gonna get it.

309
00:15:14,275 --> 00:15:16,895
Maya told me you've been at the
station for, what, 10 years?

310
00:15:16,896 --> 00:15:17,827
Right?

311
00:15:17,828 --> 00:15:19,343
Yeah.

312
00:15:19,344 --> 00:15:20,895
You're like a local hero.

313
00:15:20,896 --> 00:15:22,413
Give me too much credit, Elle.

314
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,343
I gotta get out here.

315
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:29,930
All right?

316
00:15:29,931 --> 00:15:31,068
Welcome to the family.

317
00:15:37,586 --> 00:15:39,447
Grabbed your mail again.

318
00:15:39,448 --> 00:15:41,550
They really should put
the boxes further apart.

319
00:15:41,551 --> 00:15:42,999
Thank you.

320
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,344
So you have company over?

321
00:15:45,896 --> 00:15:48,826
Yeah, new nanny,
my wife's idea.

322
00:15:48,827 --> 00:15:51,241
Quite the looker, for a nanny.

323
00:15:53,379 --> 00:15:55,172
Have a good day, Mr. Stocklan.

324
00:15:56,896 --> 00:15:59,655
(dramatic music)

325
00:16:17,413 --> 00:16:21,585
The cab's on its way, so
I'm having a little pre-drink.

326
00:16:21,586 --> 00:16:23,758
Girl, of course I don't
drink in front of Ian.

327
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:28,379
I've got a secret bottle stashed
away for special occasions.

328
00:16:29,586 --> 00:16:32,723
(Maya laughs)

329
00:16:32,724 --> 00:16:34,068
All right, see you soon.

330
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Who was that?

331
00:16:40,551 --> 00:16:41,930
That was Megan.

332
00:16:41,931 --> 00:16:43,481
Oh.

333
00:16:43,482 --> 00:16:45,412
Oh, honey, I'm
so sorry, I just-

334
00:16:45,413 --> 00:16:46,964
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, babe.

335
00:16:46,965 --> 00:16:48,447
Listen, I made
dinner reservations

336
00:16:48,448 --> 00:16:50,585
at your favorite
restaurant tonight.

337
00:16:50,586 --> 00:16:53,171
But, honey, I told you
I was going out tonight.

338
00:16:53,172 --> 00:16:55,654
Baby, I know, but I just
wanted to surprise you.

339
00:16:55,655 --> 00:16:58,067
Look, I'm tired of the
rift between us, all right?

340
00:16:58,068 --> 00:16:59,585
And you'd be happy to know

341
00:16:59,586 --> 00:17:01,517
that I'm meeting with my
sponsor in the morning.

342
00:17:03,344 --> 00:17:05,377
Baby, I just wanna be perfect
for you, for the family.

343
00:17:05,378 --> 00:17:07,033
Honey, that is so sweet,

344
00:17:07,034 --> 00:17:08,963
but can we do this
tomorrow night instead?

345
00:17:08,964 --> 00:17:10,861
No, baby, come on.

346
00:17:10,862 --> 00:17:12,481
Look, I just wanna spend a
little more time with you

347
00:17:12,482 --> 00:17:14,378
before you go back
to work, all right?

348
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:18,412
Listen, we still have
a chance, all right?

349
00:17:18,413 --> 00:17:23,136
You've been tired lately, and
baby, I never get to see you.

350
00:17:23,137 --> 00:17:25,204
So I wanna see you tonight.

351
00:17:25,205 --> 00:17:27,550
The point is, I promised
Megan that I would go.

352
00:17:29,482 --> 00:17:31,309
Okay, so what I'm hearing is
that you'd rather spend time

353
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:32,999
with your little friends than
stay home with me, right?

354
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,412
What, are you trying
to avoid me, Maya?

355
00:17:34,413 --> 00:17:36,481
I'm not trying to avoid you.

356
00:17:36,482 --> 00:17:37,999
Really?

357
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,136
We never spend
any time together.

358
00:17:39,137 --> 00:17:41,309
No, because every time we do,

359
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,964
all you wanna talk
about is having a son.

360
00:17:43,965 --> 00:17:45,964
Honey, I have told
you a million times

361
00:17:45,965 --> 00:17:48,205
that I don't want another baby,

362
00:17:48,206 --> 00:17:50,378
especially not with
someone who keeps on lying

363
00:17:50,379 --> 00:17:51,826
about their drinking
and gambling.

364
00:17:51,827 --> 00:17:54,481
Look, Ian, you are an addict.

365
00:17:54,482 --> 00:17:56,309
So what you're saying is
you'll have another child,

366
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:58,309
just not by me, right?

367
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:00,343
Honey, that's not
what I'm saying.

368
00:18:00,344 --> 00:18:03,205
I'm trying to say that I don't
want another kid, period.

369
00:18:03,206 --> 00:18:05,067
But what about me, Maya?

370
00:18:05,068 --> 00:18:06,309
Huh?

371
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:07,723
Why do I never get a say?

372
00:18:07,724 --> 00:18:09,274
You're always telling
me what to do,

373
00:18:09,275 --> 00:18:10,757
but you never listen
to what I want.

374
00:18:10,758 --> 00:18:13,447
Ian, I am not trying
to tell you what to do.

375
00:18:13,448 --> 00:18:15,412
I'm just asking you
to stop drinking

376
00:18:15,413 --> 00:18:18,240
and gambling our savings away.

377
00:18:18,241 --> 00:18:20,309
And if you think that's
me being controlling,

378
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:23,757
then I'm sorry to say it,
babe, but you're delusional.

379
00:18:23,758 --> 00:18:26,516
You don't get to
speak to me like that.

380
00:18:26,517 --> 00:18:27,861
Calm down.

381
00:18:27,862 --> 00:18:29,516
I'm going out.

382
00:18:29,517 --> 00:18:30,413
Let me!

383
00:18:30,414 --> 00:18:32,067
I'm your husband.

384
00:18:32,068 --> 00:18:34,586
You don't get to just walk out.

385
00:18:36,689 --> 00:18:37,689
Ian.

386
00:18:38,965 --> 00:18:42,136
We can talk about this tomorrow.

387
00:18:42,137 --> 00:18:43,137
Please.

388
00:18:46,241 --> 00:18:48,412
You know what?

389
00:18:48,413 --> 00:18:49,413
Fine.

390
00:18:51,758 --> 00:18:53,172
Do what you want.

391
00:18:57,586 --> 00:18:58,586
Oh.

392
00:19:01,379 --> 00:19:03,931
(tense music)

393
00:19:25,655 --> 00:19:28,241
(Maya panting)

394
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:51,931
(body thuds)

395
00:20:01,655 --> 00:20:02,655
Oh, baby.

396
00:20:04,896 --> 00:20:07,482
Looks like your friends
are gonna miss you tonight.

397
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:18,931
(tense music)

398
00:20:27,758 --> 00:20:28,758
Oh my God.

399
00:21:06,896 --> 00:21:09,378
(Maya sighs)

400
00:21:09,379 --> 00:21:12,482
(suspenseful music)

401
00:21:58,172 --> 00:22:00,793
(solemn music)

402
00:22:24,896 --> 00:22:27,379
(Maya crying)

403
00:22:59,103 --> 00:23:02,103
(officers murmuring)

404
00:23:05,172 --> 00:23:07,896
(dramatic music)

405
00:23:19,344 --> 00:23:21,343
All right, what happened?

406
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:23,171
Man, I left my
phone in the office.

407
00:23:23,172 --> 00:23:24,964
Gotta go back inside.

408
00:23:24,965 --> 00:23:26,550
All right.

409
00:23:26,551 --> 00:23:27,344
I'll wait for you, huh?

410
00:23:27,345 --> 00:23:28,896
All right.

411
00:23:38,827 --> 00:23:41,343
Hey, I'm Liz, Deputy Chief.

412
00:23:41,344 --> 00:23:42,757
Hi.

413
00:23:42,758 --> 00:23:44,378
Do you need help
with something?

414
00:23:44,379 --> 00:23:46,205
I was hoping that
someone can help me out

415
00:23:46,206 --> 00:23:49,240
with this situation that I-

416
00:23:49,241 --> 00:23:50,241
- Maya.

417
00:23:51,241 --> 00:23:52,241
Hey.

418
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Hey, baby.

419
00:24:00,482 --> 00:24:02,033
What are you doing here?

420
00:24:02,034 --> 00:24:05,412
I thought you were
on patrol today.

421
00:24:05,413 --> 00:24:07,241
I was, but I
left my phone here.

422
00:24:09,103 --> 00:24:10,136
I'm sorry.

423
00:24:10,137 --> 00:24:13,067
I know how much you hate
being a traffic cop.

424
00:24:13,068 --> 00:24:17,862
Oh, (laughs) I know you've
been forgetting your lunch

425
00:24:18,448 --> 00:24:19,895
a lot lately,

426
00:24:19,896 --> 00:24:22,620
so I decided I would bring
you something just in case.

427
00:24:24,517 --> 00:24:25,723
Thank you, baby.

428
00:24:25,724 --> 00:24:27,688
Okay, I'm gonna leave.

429
00:24:27,689 --> 00:24:29,205
Wait, wait, wait.

430
00:24:29,206 --> 00:24:30,481
Are you sure you're doing okay?

431
00:24:30,482 --> 00:24:32,000
Yes, honey, I'm fine.

432
00:24:34,862 --> 00:24:36,000
Wait here.

433
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:44,931
It's nice to meet you.

434
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:47,931
Ian talks very highly of you.

435
00:24:48,931 --> 00:24:50,068
Thanks.

436
00:24:51,724 --> 00:24:54,172
That's sweet of you,
bringing him his lunch.

437
00:24:56,241 --> 00:24:57,206
It's no big deal.

438
00:24:57,207 --> 00:24:58,517
Yeah.

439
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:04,103
(clears throat) My phone number.

440
00:25:05,482 --> 00:25:07,586
In case you ever need it.

441
00:25:10,551 --> 00:25:12,586
Are you sure you're all right?

442
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,447
Baby, I'm just going to
go ahead and take you home.

443
00:25:16,448 --> 00:25:17,654
Chief said it's all good.

444
00:25:17,655 --> 00:25:18,930
He's gonna send
someone else out.

445
00:25:18,931 --> 00:25:20,757
Honey, I told you
that's not necessary.

446
00:25:20,758 --> 00:25:22,447
I'm just going
over to the store.

447
00:25:22,448 --> 00:25:24,654
Baby, it's no big
deal, all right?

448
00:25:24,655 --> 00:25:26,931
Besides, that's for the best.

449
00:25:27,758 --> 00:25:29,586
You look a little tired anyway.

450
00:25:31,275 --> 00:25:32,861
I'm gonna go change, all right?

451
00:25:32,862 --> 00:25:34,516
Chief'll keep you company.

452
00:25:34,517 --> 00:25:35,931
His daughter's in
the music class.

453
00:25:43,793 --> 00:25:45,654
What you over there doing?

454
00:25:45,655 --> 00:25:46,964
You reading?

455
00:25:46,965 --> 00:25:47,965
Yeah.

456
00:25:55,103 --> 00:25:57,586
(tense music)

457
00:25:58,931 --> 00:26:01,343
Was there something else
you wanted to show me?

458
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:02,344
Come, come.

459
00:26:03,965 --> 00:26:06,205
Oh, okay you want me
to see something else?

460
00:26:06,206 --> 00:26:07,379
Let's go, all right.

461
00:26:10,448 --> 00:26:13,516
Oh, what do you want me to see?

462
00:26:13,517 --> 00:26:15,550
Can we play with my dolls?

463
00:26:15,551 --> 00:26:16,758
Your dolls?

464
00:26:18,034 --> 00:26:19,171
Of course we can
play with your dolls.

465
00:26:19,172 --> 00:26:20,274
Is that your doll house?

466
00:26:20,275 --> 00:26:21,275
Yeah.

467
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:24,460
Show me how you like
to play with your dolls.

468
00:26:27,482 --> 00:26:30,000
(Elle laughs)

469
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:34,274
All right, I'll be right
back, sweetheart, okay?

470
00:26:34,275 --> 00:26:35,826
- Okay.
- Okay.

471
00:26:35,827 --> 00:26:37,172
Stay right here, okay?

472
00:26:39,862 --> 00:26:43,000
(suspenseful music)

473
00:27:13,896 --> 00:27:15,068
What about your car?

474
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,896
I'll bike in tomorrow
and pick it up.

475
00:27:21,103 --> 00:27:22,827
What were you doing there, Maya?

476
00:27:24,448 --> 00:27:26,448
Can't a wife do something
nice for her husband?

477
00:27:28,241 --> 00:27:31,103
(suspenseful music)

478
00:27:38,793 --> 00:27:42,447
(camera clicking)

479
00:27:42,448 --> 00:27:44,067
No, seriously, what do
you think you were doing,

480
00:27:44,068 --> 00:27:45,827
just showing up at
my work like that?

481
00:27:48,137 --> 00:27:51,034
You know, I've just been
anxious lately and I missed you.

482
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:55,240
You know, sometimes
you forget your lunch,

483
00:27:55,241 --> 00:27:57,206
so I figured I'd bring
something by the station.

484
00:27:58,655 --> 00:28:01,103
Elle's home with the kids, so...

485
00:28:04,689 --> 00:28:06,206
Ian, I'm sorry about yesterday.

486
00:28:08,068 --> 00:28:10,378
You were right, we don't
spend enough time together,

487
00:28:10,379 --> 00:28:11,965
just the two of us.

488
00:28:15,241 --> 00:28:16,792
It's okay.

489
00:28:16,793 --> 00:28:18,103
You sure that's everything?

490
00:28:19,896 --> 00:28:21,378
I talked to the principal

491
00:28:21,379 --> 00:28:24,172
and he said there
may not be a budget

492
00:28:25,724 --> 00:28:27,324
to where they can hire
me back full-time.

493
00:28:28,137 --> 00:28:29,826
In fact, they may be getting rid

494
00:28:29,827 --> 00:28:32,482
of the music program
altogether, so...

495
00:28:34,068 --> 00:28:35,688
You know how bad I've
wanted this, Ian.

496
00:28:35,689 --> 00:28:38,000
I was just, I was upset.

497
00:28:39,827 --> 00:28:42,103
But I knew you were the
person to cheer me on.

498
00:28:46,137 --> 00:28:48,000
Baby, I'm sorry
to hear about that.

499
00:28:49,896 --> 00:28:51,550
Wait, I thought your meeting

500
00:28:51,551 --> 00:28:53,103
with the principal
was yesterday.

501
00:28:58,137 --> 00:29:02,861
Yeah, but (laughs) I let
them borrow my music stand,

502
00:29:02,862 --> 00:29:04,517
so I had to go back
and pick it up.

503
00:29:10,827 --> 00:29:13,585
Would you mind stopping
at the grocery store?

504
00:29:13,586 --> 00:29:16,241
Elle said she needed a few
things for dinner tonight.

505
00:29:17,551 --> 00:29:19,000
(Ian) Can stop by there later.

506
00:29:19,931 --> 00:29:21,861
Don't worry about that.

507
00:29:21,862 --> 00:29:25,205
(camera clicking)

508
00:29:25,206 --> 00:29:26,206
Hi.

509
00:29:27,689 --> 00:29:29,412
Hi, little lady.

510
00:29:29,413 --> 00:29:32,757
I'll be back downstairs
in a second, okay?

511
00:29:32,758 --> 00:29:33,758
What you doing?

512
00:29:36,103 --> 00:29:40,550
I'm planning a surprise
for your mommy and daddy.

513
00:29:40,551 --> 00:29:44,481
They're gonna be really happy
about it, (laughs) okay?

514
00:29:44,482 --> 00:29:46,033
They're gonna be so happy.

515
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:47,481
But you have to keep
it between me and you,

516
00:29:47,482 --> 00:29:48,895
just for a little bit, okay?

517
00:29:48,896 --> 00:29:50,619
You can't tell
them I was in here.

518
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:52,275
A surprise?

519
00:29:53,551 --> 00:29:56,205
Yeah, like a surprise party!

520
00:29:56,206 --> 00:29:57,206
Right?

521
00:29:58,413 --> 00:30:02,586
So, this is our
little secret, okay?

522
00:30:06,206 --> 00:30:06,965
Noelle?

523
00:30:06,966 --> 00:30:09,033
Is that me?

524
00:30:09,034 --> 00:30:10,964
Can I, let me see, let
me see if that's you.

525
00:30:10,965 --> 00:30:12,378
Hold on, let, can I see it?

526
00:30:12,379 --> 00:30:13,688
Give it back, Noelle.

527
00:30:13,689 --> 00:30:14,689
Give it back.

528
00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:16,619
Noelle, let me, okay.

529
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:17,620
Noelle.

530
00:30:19,862 --> 00:30:21,240
This isn't funny, Noelle.

531
00:30:21,241 --> 00:30:24,585
Give it back.

532
00:30:24,586 --> 00:30:26,517
Ow, you're hurting me!

533
00:30:27,689 --> 00:30:29,516
Give it back, I need it.

534
00:30:29,517 --> 00:30:30,517
I need that back.

535
00:30:35,379 --> 00:30:35,965
Come here, I'm sorry.

536
00:30:35,966 --> 00:30:37,585
Are you okay?

537
00:30:37,586 --> 00:30:38,586
You okay?

538
00:30:39,931 --> 00:30:41,379
I gotta get back to work.

539
00:30:42,586 --> 00:30:43,586
Babe, you need to rest.

540
00:30:43,587 --> 00:30:45,067
You seem a little off.

541
00:30:45,068 --> 00:30:46,136
I know, but if they
keep the program,

542
00:30:46,137 --> 00:30:47,344
I've got a lesson plan due.

543
00:30:48,862 --> 00:30:49,965
You wanna go play?

544
00:30:50,758 --> 00:30:51,792
Yeah, you do.

545
00:30:51,793 --> 00:30:53,378
Come on, let's go.

546
00:30:53,379 --> 00:30:54,619
Let's go play.

547
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:55,895
Remember I showed you that?

548
00:30:55,896 --> 00:30:56,896
Let's go play.

549
00:30:56,897 --> 00:30:58,172
Elle, girls.

550
00:30:59,793 --> 00:31:00,964
We need to talk.

551
00:31:00,965 --> 00:31:02,205
Ian, I am busy.

552
00:31:02,206 --> 00:31:04,171
Babe, we need to talk now.

553
00:31:04,172 --> 00:31:06,309
(Maya) God, do you not
understand what busy means?

554
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:08,274
But you have to promise me.

555
00:31:08,275 --> 00:31:11,585
Come on, pinky promise
that you won't say anything

556
00:31:11,586 --> 00:31:12,655
to mommy or daddy.

557
00:31:14,206 --> 00:31:16,241
We don't want daddy
to get mad, right?

558
00:31:17,103 --> 00:31:18,654
All right, promise.

559
00:31:18,655 --> 00:31:20,309
I promise.

560
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:21,310
Nice.

561
00:31:23,758 --> 00:31:24,758
What's this?

562
00:31:34,103 --> 00:31:35,619
Who did you show this to?

563
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:36,780
I didn't show it to anyone.

564
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:42,757
What is wrong with you, Maya?

565
00:31:42,758 --> 00:31:43,931
What's wrong with me?

566
00:31:45,655 --> 00:31:47,068
What happened last night, Ian?

567
00:31:48,965 --> 00:31:51,516
You wanna tell me why I've
been sleeping so much?

568
00:31:51,517 --> 00:31:55,274
Why I have no idea how I
got into the bed last night?

569
00:31:55,275 --> 00:31:58,447
I know that you put
something in my drink.

570
00:31:58,448 --> 00:32:01,171
If you show that to someone,
you will destroy our family.

571
00:32:01,172 --> 00:32:04,137
You have already
destroyed our family!

572
00:32:05,862 --> 00:32:08,171
With all of the gambling and
the drinking and now this?

573
00:32:08,172 --> 00:32:10,034
You didn't give
me a choice, Maya.

574
00:32:10,931 --> 00:32:13,033
You're being selfish.

575
00:32:13,034 --> 00:32:15,310
I've adopted your kids
and what did I get, huh?

576
00:32:16,827 --> 00:32:19,688
You know how much I want a son.

577
00:32:19,689 --> 00:32:21,205
A family, baby,

578
00:32:21,206 --> 00:32:22,274
a son to be able to
pass something down to,

579
00:32:22,275 --> 00:32:23,999
just like my dad did for me.

580
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,206
That's exactly what
this world needs.

581
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:30,068
Another drunk trying to
deal with his demons.

582
00:32:31,448 --> 00:32:33,378
I thought you were
different, Ian.

583
00:32:33,379 --> 00:32:38,000
What you have done to me,
what you have done to my kids?

584
00:32:38,862 --> 00:32:40,206
I just want a son.

585
00:32:42,172 --> 00:32:43,757
A perfect family, baby.

586
00:32:43,758 --> 00:32:44,758
Don't touch me.

587
00:32:52,068 --> 00:32:54,826
Hello, I'd like to
report a disturbance.

588
00:32:54,827 --> 00:32:56,206
You disgust me.

589
00:32:57,862 --> 00:32:59,688
Wait, what did you say?

590
00:32:59,689 --> 00:33:01,171
You think you're the only one

591
00:33:01,172 --> 00:33:02,999
to be able to
gather up evidence?

592
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,585
What if the wrong things ended
up in your purse or your car?

593
00:33:06,586 --> 00:33:09,826
Or maybe in your system
because of a drug-laced drink.

594
00:33:09,827 --> 00:33:11,067
Huh?

595
00:33:11,068 --> 00:33:13,413
I am going to be a lieutenant.

596
00:33:15,310 --> 00:33:17,136
And baby, you already know
the influence that I have,

597
00:33:17,137 --> 00:33:18,585
the people that I know.

598
00:33:18,586 --> 00:33:19,895
Who do you think
they're gonna believe?

599
00:33:19,896 --> 00:33:21,309
We're married, Maya.

600
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:22,930
And I'll have
custody of the kids

601
00:33:22,931 --> 00:33:24,413
if anything was
to happen to you.

602
00:33:25,965 --> 00:33:27,688
And then maybe then
I'll find a real woman

603
00:33:27,689 --> 00:33:30,206
who can gimme the family
that I need, that I deserve.

604
00:33:31,275 --> 00:33:32,551
Baby, if you try to run,

605
00:33:34,827 --> 00:33:35,827
I'll find you.

606
00:33:37,482 --> 00:33:39,550
You remember what
happened last time, right?

607
00:33:39,551 --> 00:33:41,412
Cops pulled you over

608
00:33:41,413 --> 00:33:44,206
and they brought you right
back home to me, to Daddy.

609
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:49,895
You know it could have ended
up very differently though,

610
00:33:49,896 --> 00:33:50,896
right?

611
00:33:52,758 --> 00:33:55,241
You will never escape me, Maya.

612
00:33:56,413 --> 00:33:57,413
Ever.

613
00:33:58,827 --> 00:33:59,827
My reach is too long.

614
00:34:03,965 --> 00:34:06,551
(Maya gasping)

615
00:34:07,655 --> 00:34:08,655
This right here?

616
00:34:09,793 --> 00:34:10,793
This is your problem

617
00:34:13,482 --> 00:34:15,136
because you're always
holding on to things

618
00:34:15,137 --> 00:34:16,275
that haunt our family.

619
00:34:19,516 --> 00:34:22,172
(paper ripping)

620
00:34:27,724 --> 00:34:30,275
He was a better man
than you will ever be.

621
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,447
I thank God every day that those
kids are his and not yours.

622
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:39,103
I hate you.

623
00:34:40,172 --> 00:34:41,206
I want my son.

624
00:34:50,137 --> 00:34:52,620
(Maya crying)

625
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:02,448
(dishes rattling)

626
00:35:10,137 --> 00:35:12,862
(glass smashing)

627
00:35:17,137 --> 00:35:18,172
Ian.

628
00:35:20,689 --> 00:35:22,205
Mommy!

629
00:35:22,206 --> 00:35:23,862
Oh, hey, baby, hey.

630
00:35:25,793 --> 00:35:27,033
Is everything okay?

631
00:35:27,034 --> 00:35:28,067
Yeah, yeah.

632
00:35:28,068 --> 00:35:30,205
Maya just broke a glass.

633
00:35:30,206 --> 00:35:32,102
So, baby, watch your foot.

634
00:35:32,103 --> 00:35:33,793
It's okay, baby,
everything's fine.

635
00:35:35,551 --> 00:35:37,067
Why don't you take
Noelle back outside

636
00:35:37,068 --> 00:35:39,136
while we clean up in here?

637
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:40,137
Where's Grace?

638
00:35:41,206 --> 00:35:42,378
She's in her room.

639
00:35:42,379 --> 00:35:43,930
You want me to go get her?

640
00:35:43,931 --> 00:35:45,826
No, no, no, I'll take her.

641
00:35:45,827 --> 00:35:47,861
I'll grab Grace too, 'cause I
gotta go to the store anyways.

642
00:35:47,862 --> 00:35:49,550
I'll help clean up.

643
00:35:49,551 --> 00:35:51,033
Let's let Maya clear her head.

644
00:35:51,034 --> 00:35:52,689
No, no, Noelle can go.

645
00:35:54,206 --> 00:35:56,136
Grace can stay right
here where she is.

646
00:35:56,137 --> 00:35:57,172
Here with Daddy.

647
00:35:58,551 --> 00:36:01,482
Okay, I'll stay and
give Grace her bath.

648
00:36:12,137 --> 00:36:14,448
(knocking)

649
00:36:23,275 --> 00:36:24,275
What's going on over here?

650
00:36:24,276 --> 00:36:26,102
Is everything all right?

651
00:36:26,103 --> 00:36:28,655
(solemn music)

652
00:37:03,103 --> 00:37:05,827
(glass clinking)

653
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,724
(dramatic music)

654
00:37:41,689 --> 00:37:44,000
(door slams)

655
00:37:52,758 --> 00:37:54,378
Hernandez, you
know there's a reason

656
00:37:54,379 --> 00:37:55,999
why they refer to
it as a call in.

657
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,757
I'm not calling you in.

658
00:37:57,758 --> 00:37:59,999
We received a call from
one of your neighbors.

659
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,482
Something about a disturbance.

660
00:38:03,137 --> 00:38:05,137
You know, me and Maya,
we just had a little spat.

661
00:38:06,275 --> 00:38:07,309
I mean, you know how it is.

662
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:08,310
No, I don't.

663
00:38:09,482 --> 00:38:10,482
Can I come in?

664
00:38:21,241 --> 00:38:23,103
So, where is Maya?

665
00:38:24,344 --> 00:38:25,895
That's your wife's name, right?

666
00:38:25,896 --> 00:38:27,067
She went to the store.

667
00:38:27,068 --> 00:38:28,930
Is this really necessary?

668
00:38:28,931 --> 00:38:31,051
We have to follow through
with any calls we receive.

669
00:38:32,241 --> 00:38:33,379
You know that.

670
00:38:36,103 --> 00:38:37,688
Liz, Liz.

671
00:38:37,689 --> 00:38:39,964
Always doing
everything by the book.

672
00:38:39,965 --> 00:38:40,965
(Liz) That's me.

673
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
This way.

674
00:38:49,103 --> 00:38:50,586
Liz, this is our nanny, Elle.

675
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:53,516
Oh.

676
00:38:53,517 --> 00:38:55,688
Are you here to chat with
the soon to be Lieutenant?

677
00:38:55,689 --> 00:38:58,412
I wanted to talk
to Maya actually.

678
00:38:58,413 --> 00:39:00,240
Do you know when she'll be back?

679
00:39:00,241 --> 00:39:01,378
No idea.

680
00:39:01,379 --> 00:39:02,448
Sorry.

681
00:39:03,310 --> 00:39:05,412
Is there a problem?

682
00:39:05,413 --> 00:39:07,205
One of the neighbors called,

683
00:39:07,206 --> 00:39:08,792
probably heard the scream
when Maya dropped the glass.

684
00:39:08,793 --> 00:39:10,309
You know how clumsy she can be.

685
00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:11,378
Glass?

686
00:39:11,379 --> 00:39:13,481
Right, the glass.

687
00:39:13,482 --> 00:39:16,517
(radio chattering)

688
00:39:18,344 --> 00:39:20,378
Sounds like it's
gonna be a long shift.

689
00:39:20,379 --> 00:39:21,379
Apparently.

690
00:39:22,206 --> 00:39:23,206
I gotta go.

691
00:39:24,034 --> 00:39:25,034
I'll see you tomorrow.

692
00:39:26,344 --> 00:39:27,481
Thanks for stopping by, Liz.

693
00:39:27,482 --> 00:39:29,481
It's always a pleasure.

694
00:39:29,482 --> 00:39:32,000
(tense music)

695
00:39:43,965 --> 00:39:44,965
Hey.

696
00:39:46,344 --> 00:39:48,240
I'm about to put the
kids down for a nap.

697
00:39:48,241 --> 00:39:51,757
Miss Grace won't sleep until
you sing the alphabet remix.

698
00:39:51,758 --> 00:39:54,793
Ah, she will be coming
after your job soon.

699
00:40:00,241 --> 00:40:01,689
You seen anything interesting?

700
00:40:06,896 --> 00:40:07,896
Are you all right?

701
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,033
(Maya vomiting)

702
00:40:10,034 --> 00:40:11,724
Oh, Maya, are you okay?

703
00:40:14,827 --> 00:40:16,482
Here, let me, let me help you.

704
00:40:18,310 --> 00:40:21,343
Come on, I got you.

705
00:40:21,344 --> 00:40:22,344
Sorry.

706
00:40:24,896 --> 00:40:26,378
You okay?

707
00:40:26,379 --> 00:40:27,448
Yeah.

708
00:40:30,034 --> 00:40:33,688
Just haven't been feeling so
great these past couple days.

709
00:40:33,689 --> 00:40:35,482
Something like a stomach bug?

710
00:40:36,241 --> 00:40:37,241
Yeah.

711
00:40:39,862 --> 00:40:40,862
I guess so.

712
00:40:46,206 --> 00:40:47,999
Hey, Elle, don't
worry about it.

713
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,826
I don't think Maya's gonna
be eating with us anyway.

714
00:40:50,827 --> 00:40:52,826
You know, she's
not feeling well.

715
00:40:52,827 --> 00:40:53,827
She'll probably be down
for the rest of the night.

716
00:40:53,828 --> 00:40:55,481
Plus the kids already ate, so...

717
00:40:55,482 --> 00:40:57,240
Well, I don't mind
cooking for you.

718
00:40:57,241 --> 00:40:59,792
And I could eat.

719
00:40:59,793 --> 00:41:02,274
Maybe we just have
dinner together,

720
00:41:02,275 --> 00:41:03,724
if that's okay with you.

721
00:41:05,517 --> 00:41:07,067
Sure.

722
00:41:07,068 --> 00:41:08,412
All right.

723
00:41:08,413 --> 00:41:09,654
Go relax.

724
00:41:09,655 --> 00:41:11,000
I'll take care of everything.

725
00:41:13,931 --> 00:41:16,551
(ominous music)

726
00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:28,516
I did, I used to play.

727
00:41:28,517 --> 00:41:29,723
I was really good.

728
00:41:29,724 --> 00:41:31,240
No.

729
00:41:31,241 --> 00:41:32,378
- Yes, I was.
- No, you weren't.

730
00:41:32,379 --> 00:41:33,826
Yeah, you should believe me.

731
00:41:33,827 --> 00:41:34,758
Don't I look like a
basketball player?

732
00:41:34,759 --> 00:41:36,033
Like, look at my arms.

733
00:41:36,034 --> 00:41:37,205
You don't.

734
00:41:37,206 --> 00:41:39,067
I work out.

735
00:41:39,068 --> 00:41:42,688
And I definitely, definitely
can shoot some hoops, so...

736
00:41:42,689 --> 00:41:44,447
Don't tell Maya about this.

737
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:45,413
What?

738
00:41:45,414 --> 00:41:47,033
Of course not.

739
00:41:47,034 --> 00:41:48,034
Thank you.

740
00:41:49,241 --> 00:41:51,861
I haven't had the chance
to get to know you yet,

741
00:41:51,862 --> 00:41:54,205
so it's nice to have
a drink with you.

742
00:41:54,206 --> 00:41:56,067
It is nice.

743
00:41:56,068 --> 00:41:57,068
Cheers.

744
00:41:58,413 --> 00:42:00,447
And I deserve it, right?

745
00:42:00,448 --> 00:42:02,309
I do.

746
00:42:02,310 --> 00:42:05,309
I mean, it's not like Maya's
here to nag me about it anyway.

747
00:42:05,310 --> 00:42:07,586
Gosh, she worries too much.

748
00:42:08,689 --> 00:42:10,620
I can handle myself.

749
00:42:11,413 --> 00:42:12,413
She cares.

750
00:42:13,448 --> 00:42:14,654
That's, that's what that is.

751
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:15,930
That's what that is?

752
00:42:15,931 --> 00:42:17,481
Yeah.

753
00:42:17,482 --> 00:42:18,842
I mean, you guys
have a good thing.

754
00:42:20,448 --> 00:42:21,586
(sighs) You know what?

755
00:42:22,931 --> 00:42:25,378
I've been jealous
of women like Maya.

756
00:42:25,379 --> 00:42:26,379
Jealous, why?

757
00:42:27,310 --> 00:42:29,999
I just, come on.

758
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,654
She has everything
that I've ever wanted.

759
00:42:32,655 --> 00:42:34,585
A good husband.

760
00:42:34,586 --> 00:42:36,826
This house is amazing.

761
00:42:36,827 --> 00:42:40,068
And your kids are so cute.

762
00:42:41,482 --> 00:42:42,930
They really are.

763
00:42:42,931 --> 00:42:44,275
I, I've always
wanted to be a mom.

764
00:42:45,275 --> 00:42:46,309
Really?

765
00:42:46,310 --> 00:42:47,310
Mm-hmm.

766
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:50,585
I've always
wanted to be a dad.

767
00:42:50,586 --> 00:42:51,482
Really?

768
00:42:51,483 --> 00:42:53,343
Yeah.

769
00:42:53,344 --> 00:42:55,655
I mean, it'd be nice to
have one of my own one day.

770
00:42:57,137 --> 00:42:59,068
You know, I mean, gosh,

771
00:43:00,275 --> 00:43:02,102
that's all I've ever wanted.

772
00:43:02,103 --> 00:43:05,171
You know, my dad used
to always tell me,

773
00:43:05,172 --> 00:43:09,137
"A man's not a man unless
he knows how to raise one."

774
00:43:10,724 --> 00:43:12,379
Oh, well, that's an
interesting saying.

775
00:43:13,931 --> 00:43:15,757
He had a lot of them.

776
00:43:15,758 --> 00:43:17,861
(Elle laughs)

777
00:43:17,862 --> 00:43:19,827
All I've ever wanted to
do was to make him proud.

778
00:43:21,586 --> 00:43:25,861
Show him that I'm
my own man, right?

779
00:43:25,862 --> 00:43:27,827
Like, I hope I did that.

780
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:32,931
Yeah, well, I can relate.

781
00:43:34,551 --> 00:43:36,999
I've had baby fever
since I was little.

782
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,550
Really?

783
00:43:38,551 --> 00:43:40,191
Yes, I remember my
kindergarten teacher.

784
00:43:41,827 --> 00:43:44,723
She, she was pregnant

785
00:43:44,724 --> 00:43:48,240
and the next year she had
the cutest little baby.

786
00:43:48,241 --> 00:43:50,067
I was so obsessed with him.

787
00:43:50,068 --> 00:43:52,896
I kept wanting to carry him
around every time she visited.

788
00:43:53,896 --> 00:43:55,241
She was my favorite teacher.

789
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,412
My kindergarten teacher
was a crazy bitch.

790
00:43:59,413 --> 00:44:00,826
Really?

791
00:44:00,827 --> 00:44:01,999
(laughs) Yeah, my gosh.

792
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,103
So sorry, that's awful.

793
00:44:05,551 --> 00:44:08,309
Ms. Johnson.

794
00:44:08,310 --> 00:44:09,723
Still remember her name.

795
00:44:09,724 --> 00:44:11,724
I will never forget her.

796
00:44:13,931 --> 00:44:15,619
(laughs) Hey, where,

797
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:17,447
where'd you say you
went to school at again?

798
00:44:17,448 --> 00:44:18,448
Seattle.

799
00:44:19,758 --> 00:44:21,309
Hooping in Seattle.

800
00:44:21,310 --> 00:44:22,585
Oh.

801
00:44:22,586 --> 00:44:23,786
Yeah, I didn't grow up here.

802
00:44:25,689 --> 00:44:30,309
Well, Miss Seattle,
who never played ball.

803
00:44:30,310 --> 00:44:31,310
Come on.

804
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,724
I think you're going to
make a great mom one day.

805
00:44:37,103 --> 00:44:38,240
(Elle laughs)

806
00:44:38,241 --> 00:44:39,550
Cheers to that?

807
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:41,550
Cheers to that.

808
00:44:41,551 --> 00:44:43,585
(glasses clinking)

809
00:44:43,586 --> 00:44:45,067
You didn't drink it.

810
00:44:45,068 --> 00:44:46,723
It's not real if
you don't drink it.

811
00:44:46,724 --> 00:44:48,206
I'm not worried about that.

812
00:44:52,413 --> 00:44:54,274
I'll...

813
00:44:54,275 --> 00:44:57,793
(clears throat) I'll check
on the girls when I head out.

814
00:44:58,793 --> 00:45:00,792
I gotta go to bed anyway, huh?

815
00:45:00,793 --> 00:45:04,792
Look, just maybe
not say anything.

816
00:45:04,793 --> 00:45:06,447
Keep this between us.

817
00:45:06,448 --> 00:45:07,999
Of course.

818
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,309
Good night, Elle.

819
00:45:10,310 --> 00:45:11,310
Good night.

820
00:45:17,448 --> 00:45:18,448
Be careful.

821
00:45:18,449 --> 00:45:19,481
Them stairs.

822
00:45:19,482 --> 00:45:20,793
I know, I know.

823
00:45:22,482 --> 00:45:25,310
(suspenseful music)

824
00:45:42,965 --> 00:45:43,965
You.

825
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:46,275
You're unbelievable.

826
00:45:48,068 --> 00:45:50,206
I've done so much for you

827
00:45:51,965 --> 00:45:55,172
and you can't do this
one thing for me.

828
00:45:58,172 --> 00:45:59,172
Just one.

829
00:45:59,896 --> 00:46:01,517
But you know what?

830
00:46:05,758 --> 00:46:10,378
I realize there's so
many women out there

831
00:46:10,379 --> 00:46:12,206
that would love to
gimme what I need.

832
00:46:13,517 --> 00:46:14,517
You know why?

833
00:46:15,517 --> 00:46:16,517
No?

834
00:46:18,758 --> 00:46:21,378
'Cause I'm a good man.

835
00:46:21,379 --> 00:46:22,586
A damn good man.

836
00:46:24,206 --> 00:46:26,000
Life would be so much
easier without you.

837
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:29,585
Why?

838
00:46:29,586 --> 00:46:32,896
So you can use my insurance
money to pay off your debts?

839
00:46:41,241 --> 00:46:42,241
Huh.

840
00:46:44,137 --> 00:46:46,862
Now why didn't I think of that?

841
00:46:48,758 --> 00:46:51,344
(Ian laughing)

842
00:46:58,689 --> 00:47:01,275
(Ian kissing)

843
00:47:05,482 --> 00:47:07,447
No, no, no, no.

844
00:47:07,448 --> 00:47:08,586
Ian, Ian, stop.

845
00:47:10,206 --> 00:47:11,206
Ian, stop!

846
00:47:11,862 --> 00:47:13,344
Ian, I'm pregnant.

847
00:47:15,310 --> 00:47:16,310
I'm pregnant.

848
00:47:17,965 --> 00:47:19,137
I'm pregnant.

849
00:47:20,931 --> 00:47:21,931
What?

850
00:47:24,586 --> 00:47:27,654
Are you serious?

851
00:47:27,655 --> 00:47:29,620
I'm serious, I'm serious.

852
00:47:36,862 --> 00:47:39,482
Baby, that explains it then.

853
00:47:41,379 --> 00:47:42,999
That explains it.

854
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,931
Why, why you've been so
hysterical, right, baby?

855
00:47:47,275 --> 00:47:49,550
Because of the hormones, right?

856
00:47:49,551 --> 00:47:53,964
(laughs) Because, because
of the hormones, baby.

857
00:47:53,965 --> 00:47:58,171
Baby, baby, baby, we're
gonna have a child.

858
00:47:58,172 --> 00:47:59,172
Baby.

859
00:48:00,137 --> 00:48:02,895
Baby, we're gonna have a child.

860
00:48:02,896 --> 00:48:04,137
Oh my God, oh.

861
00:48:05,206 --> 00:48:07,033
Baby, you need your rest.

862
00:48:07,034 --> 00:48:08,999
You need your rest.

863
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:12,757
You need to rest,
come on, right here.

864
00:48:12,758 --> 00:48:14,171
Lay down right here, lay down,

865
00:48:14,172 --> 00:48:15,689
lay, lay, lay down.

866
00:48:22,896 --> 00:48:23,896
Baby.

867
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,378
You're pregnant, baby.

868
00:48:26,379 --> 00:48:28,171
You're pregnant.

869
00:48:28,172 --> 00:48:30,102
Baby, I'm gonna be a father.

870
00:48:30,103 --> 00:48:32,689
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

871
00:48:46,206 --> 00:48:49,310
(suspenseful music)

872
00:49:14,448 --> 00:49:16,309
Good to see you.

873
00:49:16,310 --> 00:49:17,310
Thank you.

874
00:49:19,482 --> 00:49:20,895
Hey.

875
00:49:20,896 --> 00:49:22,655
- Nice job.
- Thank you.

876
00:49:24,551 --> 00:49:25,895
Hey.

877
00:49:25,896 --> 00:49:28,481
Thanks, man, appreciate it.

878
00:49:28,482 --> 00:49:29,999
Good morning, Chief.

879
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,654
Good morning.

880
00:49:31,655 --> 00:49:32,655
LT.

881
00:49:34,586 --> 00:49:36,723
You are gonna be Lieutenant
by the end of the day.

882
00:49:36,724 --> 00:49:38,447
The paperwork is almost done.

883
00:49:38,448 --> 00:49:39,964
Congratulations.

884
00:49:39,965 --> 00:49:41,447
So proud of you.

885
00:49:41,448 --> 00:49:42,768
Thank you, Chief,
it's an honor.

886
00:49:43,137 --> 00:49:44,826
Hey, listen.

887
00:49:44,827 --> 00:49:45,999
Me and the guys
wanna take you out

888
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,136
at the end of the shift, right?

889
00:49:47,137 --> 00:49:48,309
So don't go anywhere, right?

890
00:49:48,310 --> 00:49:49,137
- Let's do it.
- All right.

891
00:49:49,138 --> 00:49:50,309
You know where.

892
00:49:50,310 --> 00:49:51,430
(clears throat) Excuse me.

893
00:49:52,620 --> 00:49:54,136
Emily Stocklan called again,

894
00:49:54,137 --> 00:49:56,585
looking for a wellness
check on her dad.

895
00:49:56,586 --> 00:49:58,240
I told you we don't have
the manpower for that.

896
00:49:58,241 --> 00:49:59,000
Wait, wait, wait.

897
00:49:59,001 --> 00:50:00,619
Who?

898
00:50:00,620 --> 00:50:02,240
A woman wants us to
check in on her father.

899
00:50:02,241 --> 00:50:04,067
Apparently he's not
answering the phone.

900
00:50:04,068 --> 00:50:06,067
She's called three
times this morning.

901
00:50:06,068 --> 00:50:07,206
What's the address?

902
00:50:11,448 --> 00:50:13,067
What?

903
00:50:13,068 --> 00:50:16,412
It's my neighbor,
older guy, confused.

904
00:50:16,413 --> 00:50:18,930
Chief, you mind if I pop
in and check in on him?

905
00:50:18,931 --> 00:50:20,067
I'll come with you.

906
00:50:20,068 --> 00:50:21,619
No, no, it's, it's fine.

907
00:50:21,620 --> 00:50:22,895
You should have
someone with you.

908
00:50:22,896 --> 00:50:23,724
I said I can handle it, Liz.

909
00:50:23,725 --> 00:50:25,585
Hey, hey, hey.

910
00:50:25,586 --> 00:50:26,757
Both of you go.

911
00:50:26,758 --> 00:50:27,758
Make it fast.

912
00:50:41,068 --> 00:50:42,136
Have you seen
him around lately?

913
00:50:42,137 --> 00:50:44,136
A couple days ago.

914
00:50:44,137 --> 00:50:46,217
He dropped off some mail
that he grabbed by accident.

915
00:50:50,068 --> 00:50:51,723
(knocking)

916
00:50:51,724 --> 00:50:52,724
Mr. Stocklan!

917
00:50:53,724 --> 00:50:55,034
It's Ian Flynn, your neighbor!

918
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,206
Let's go around back.

919
00:51:11,310 --> 00:51:12,792
Oh, wait a minute, wait.

920
00:51:12,793 --> 00:51:14,792
I think I see something.

921
00:51:14,793 --> 00:51:17,344
(solemn music)

922
00:51:34,689 --> 00:51:37,103
(Ian sighs)

923
00:51:41,620 --> 00:51:42,895
Hey, Chief.

924
00:51:42,896 --> 00:51:45,309
Yeah, suicide from
the looks of it.

925
00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:46,654
Yeah, coroner's taking
a look right now,

926
00:51:46,655 --> 00:51:49,550
but it looks like it's
gonna be pretty cut and dry.

927
00:51:49,551 --> 00:51:50,792
Yeah, yeah.

928
00:51:50,793 --> 00:51:51,826
Okay.

929
00:51:51,827 --> 00:51:53,895
Hernandez is talking to
the family right now.

930
00:51:53,896 --> 00:51:55,136
Okay.

931
00:51:55,137 --> 00:51:56,481
No, no, no, it's fine,
I'll, I'll wait around.

932
00:51:56,482 --> 00:51:58,724
You know, just in case
they need anything.

933
00:51:59,862 --> 00:52:01,275
All right, bye-bye.

934
00:52:04,068 --> 00:52:05,620
Talk to the daughter?

935
00:52:06,689 --> 00:52:08,206
Did you know him well?

936
00:52:09,103 --> 00:52:11,033
Ran into him in the streets
a couple times, you know?

937
00:52:11,034 --> 00:52:13,930
Lonely guy, but friendly.

938
00:52:13,931 --> 00:52:14,964
Seemed nice.

939
00:52:14,965 --> 00:52:15,862
It's a shame.

940
00:52:15,863 --> 00:52:17,172
Yeah.

941
00:52:18,827 --> 00:52:21,240
His daughter says it
came outta nowhere.

942
00:52:21,241 --> 00:52:22,447
Well, I mean,

943
00:52:22,448 --> 00:52:24,309
some people don't talk
about anything, you know?

944
00:52:24,310 --> 00:52:25,103
That's the way it is.

945
00:52:25,104 --> 00:52:26,205
Especially family.

946
00:52:26,206 --> 00:52:28,274
He had his keys on him.

947
00:52:28,275 --> 00:52:29,930
Your point?

948
00:52:29,931 --> 00:52:32,862
His house keys, in his pocket.

949
00:52:34,379 --> 00:52:36,102
Who carries their
keys around on them

950
00:52:36,103 --> 00:52:38,723
when they're planning
on killing themself?

951
00:52:38,724 --> 00:52:40,619
A lonely old man, Liz.

952
00:52:40,620 --> 00:52:43,344
Everybody's not as
sharp as you, Hernandez.

953
00:52:44,379 --> 00:52:46,689
Yeah, but something's off.

954
00:52:48,275 --> 00:52:50,205
Well, we'll wait for a
coroner's report, you know,

955
00:52:50,206 --> 00:52:52,619
get a cause of death.

956
00:52:52,620 --> 00:52:55,412
But, I mean, it
just is what it is.

957
00:52:55,413 --> 00:52:58,448
I mean, we have our people
looking at the scene, Liz.

958
00:52:59,482 --> 00:53:02,309
I mean, this guy, I mean, there
was no fingerprints, right?

959
00:53:02,310 --> 00:53:04,274
Nobody forced
themselves in the house.

960
00:53:04,275 --> 00:53:06,274
This guy had no enemies.

961
00:53:06,275 --> 00:53:08,343
Just a lonely old man

962
00:53:08,344 --> 00:53:10,827
who his only family lived
hours away from him.

963
00:53:12,517 --> 00:53:15,033
You know, sometimes the
answer's right in front of you.

964
00:53:15,034 --> 00:53:17,000
Don't think too hard.

965
00:53:18,827 --> 00:53:20,723
I'm gonna stick around.

966
00:53:20,724 --> 00:53:23,586
Why don't you head back to
the station, Lieutenant?

967
00:53:24,724 --> 00:53:26,930
Sure there's a party
brewing for you

968
00:53:26,931 --> 00:53:28,758
that you should get back to.

969
00:53:30,103 --> 00:53:31,931
Yeah, right.

970
00:53:37,965 --> 00:53:39,413
(phone chimes)

971
00:53:57,793 --> 00:54:00,827
(ominous music)

972
00:54:12,344 --> 00:54:14,724
Are you ready for
the tickle monster?

973
00:54:19,379 --> 00:54:20,516
(laughs) Oh, bedtime
already, huh?

974
00:54:20,517 --> 00:54:22,964
Will you tell me
a bedtime story?

975
00:54:22,965 --> 00:54:27,654
Well, the only one I know
is about a Queen Noelle.

976
00:54:27,655 --> 00:54:29,034
Have you ever heard of that one?

977
00:54:30,103 --> 00:54:31,103
- No.
- No?

978
00:54:32,689 --> 00:54:36,033
Well, there once was a
beautiful queen named Noelle.

979
00:54:36,034 --> 00:54:39,171
She lived in a magical castle
with her sister, Grace,

980
00:54:39,172 --> 00:54:40,172
and their mom.

981
00:54:41,689 --> 00:54:44,826
And her big crown
and her big sword.

982
00:54:44,827 --> 00:54:46,688
Of course.

983
00:54:46,689 --> 00:54:50,240
So when there was a dragon that
came to attack the castle...

984
00:54:50,241 --> 00:54:51,723
She fought it.

985
00:54:51,724 --> 00:54:52,724
No.

986
00:54:54,241 --> 00:54:56,413
Queen Noelle was way
smarter than that.

987
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,619
She knew there were
people inside that castle

988
00:54:59,620 --> 00:55:01,379
who could be hurt
by that dragon.

989
00:55:02,241 --> 00:55:03,895
So instead of fighting,

990
00:55:03,896 --> 00:55:06,067
she helped them escape
to another castle

991
00:55:06,068 --> 00:55:07,930
deep inside the woods

992
00:55:07,931 --> 00:55:10,792
where she knew they would
be safe from that dragon.

993
00:55:10,793 --> 00:55:13,309
Queen Noelle wouldn't
run away from a fight.

994
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:14,379
Hmm.

995
00:55:15,793 --> 00:55:17,586
Well, sometimes running away is

996
00:55:19,172 --> 00:55:20,724
the smartest thing you can do.

997
00:55:39,482 --> 00:55:42,586
(suspenseful music)

998
00:55:53,482 --> 00:55:56,482
(hammer pounding)

999
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,793
(engine rumbling)

1000
00:57:30,551 --> 00:57:33,000
(Ian kisses)

1001
00:57:38,931 --> 00:57:41,586
(door creaking)

1002
00:57:47,379 --> 00:57:48,379
Noelle?

1003
00:57:49,344 --> 00:57:50,861
Maya!

1004
00:57:50,862 --> 00:57:51,724
Noelle?

1005
00:57:51,724 --> 00:57:52,379
Grace?

1006
00:57:52,380 --> 00:57:53,964
Maya!

1007
00:57:53,965 --> 00:57:55,136
Oh my God.

1008
00:57:55,137 --> 00:57:56,619
Ian, why are you yelling?

1009
00:57:56,620 --> 00:57:58,033
Hey, baby, the,
the kids are missing.

1010
00:57:58,034 --> 00:57:59,378
What do you mean
they're missing?

1011
00:57:59,379 --> 00:58:00,895
They're not in their rooms.

1012
00:58:00,896 --> 00:58:02,171
They're gone, I don't
know where they are.

1013
00:58:02,172 --> 00:58:03,172
- Ian!
- Noelle!

1014
00:58:04,137 --> 00:58:05,654
- Oh my God.
- Grace!

1015
00:58:05,655 --> 00:58:08,964
(cars honking)

1016
00:58:08,965 --> 00:58:11,103
(Maya) I didn't hear
anything, I don't know.

1017
00:58:12,965 --> 00:58:15,930
What time do you think
you went to bed last night?

1018
00:58:15,931 --> 00:58:16,931
Maybe 10.

1019
00:58:18,724 --> 00:58:20,924
The next thing I know, Ian
is yelling that they're gone.

1020
00:58:25,275 --> 00:58:26,688
It's okay.

1021
00:58:26,689 --> 00:58:28,000
We're gonna find them.

1022
00:58:29,103 --> 00:58:30,654
Okay?

1023
00:58:30,655 --> 00:58:32,895
Now, I don't know
if Ian told you,

1024
00:58:32,896 --> 00:58:34,931
but I stopped by your
house the other day.

1025
00:58:37,241 --> 00:58:38,792
Why?

1026
00:58:38,793 --> 00:58:39,689
We got a call from
one of your neighbors

1027
00:58:39,690 --> 00:58:40,931
about a disturbance.

1028
00:58:42,206 --> 00:58:44,792
And I saw you guys have
some cameras set up.

1029
00:58:44,793 --> 00:58:46,757
Please don't tell Ian.

1030
00:58:46,758 --> 00:58:48,585
He has no idea
that I have those.

1031
00:58:48,586 --> 00:58:49,793
And what do you mean?

1032
00:58:51,827 --> 00:58:53,861
He wanted me to take them down

1033
00:58:53,862 --> 00:58:55,862
'cause he thought they
looked creepy, but I didn't.

1034
00:58:59,103 --> 00:59:01,343
That footage gets
downloaded to my computer,

1035
00:59:01,344 --> 00:59:05,034
but I have no idea what, or if
anything useful is on there.

1036
00:59:06,896 --> 00:59:08,896
Well, why did you put
them up in the first place?

1037
00:59:10,586 --> 00:59:12,172
Because I was
going back to work

1038
00:59:14,068 --> 00:59:17,896
and I wanted to keep an eye
on the nanny and the kids.

1039
00:59:20,551 --> 00:59:21,931
I know, Chief.

1040
00:59:26,206 --> 00:59:27,206
Right.

1041
00:59:28,586 --> 00:59:29,586
Give me a second.

1042
00:59:35,965 --> 00:59:37,826
We're gonna pull out
every resource we have.

1043
00:59:37,827 --> 00:59:39,309
Chief, those are my kids.

1044
00:59:39,310 --> 00:59:40,310
I know.

1045
00:59:47,034 --> 00:59:49,999
I think they're finished
sweeping your house for prints,

1046
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,034
so you and Ian are
fine to go back.

1047
00:59:54,034 --> 00:59:58,724
But when you do, I want you to
plug this into your computer.

1048
01:00:03,551 --> 01:00:05,688
It'll give me remote access

1049
01:00:05,689 --> 01:00:07,310
and let me look
through the footage.

1050
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,378
Thank you.

1051
01:00:15,379 --> 01:00:20,241
You're welcome.

1052
01:00:30,586 --> 01:00:32,447
Only you would sleep
through the kidnapping

1053
01:00:32,448 --> 01:00:33,448
of your own children.

1054
01:00:37,379 --> 01:00:38,758
I can't do this.

1055
01:00:40,344 --> 01:00:41,344
I need some air.

1056
01:00:43,068 --> 01:00:44,688
Flynn!

1057
01:00:44,689 --> 01:00:46,009
There's something
you need to see.

1058
01:00:49,068 --> 01:00:52,067
Well, we're currently waiting
on fingerprint analysis.

1059
01:00:52,068 --> 01:00:54,171
Locks on the back
door were broken

1060
01:00:54,172 --> 01:00:56,068
and it looked like
nothing was stolen.

1061
01:01:06,379 --> 01:01:07,379
Elle.

1062
01:01:10,103 --> 01:01:11,343
Ian.

1063
01:01:11,344 --> 01:01:12,826
What the hell is happening?

1064
01:01:12,827 --> 01:01:14,307
Maya texted me to
come to the station.

1065
01:01:15,310 --> 01:01:16,343
Kids are gone.

1066
01:01:16,344 --> 01:01:17,481
What do you mean gone?

1067
01:01:17,482 --> 01:01:18,619
I just saw them last night.

1068
01:01:18,620 --> 01:01:19,551
Where's Maya?

1069
01:01:19,552 --> 01:01:21,102
I don't know.

1070
01:01:21,103 --> 01:01:22,826
She went to get some
air or something.

1071
01:01:22,827 --> 01:01:24,412
Let me go see
if I can find her,

1072
01:01:24,413 --> 01:01:26,654
but just call me if you
need something, okay?

1073
01:01:26,655 --> 01:01:28,654
Hey, can we chat real quick?

1074
01:01:28,655 --> 01:01:30,034
I'd love to get a statement.

1075
01:01:31,448 --> 01:01:32,448
Of course.

1076
01:01:38,655 --> 01:01:41,275
(siren wailing)

1077
01:01:48,655 --> 01:01:50,034
Everything good over there?

1078
01:01:51,517 --> 01:01:52,965
Yeah, yeah, I'll be back soon.

1079
01:01:54,517 --> 01:01:55,837
Oh, it's fine, I'm
using a burner.

1080
01:02:01,448 --> 01:02:02,619
Ian.

1081
01:02:02,620 --> 01:02:03,620
Something's wrong.

1082
01:02:04,275 --> 01:02:05,275
What?

1083
01:02:13,034 --> 01:02:16,171
So I dug a little deeper.

1084
01:02:16,172 --> 01:02:18,654
There's no one named Elle Taylor

1085
01:02:18,655 --> 01:02:20,827
that's even registered
in this state.

1086
01:02:21,793 --> 01:02:23,344
She doesn't exist.

1087
01:02:26,827 --> 01:02:27,827
Who is she?

1088
01:02:35,620 --> 01:02:36,620
Okay.

1089
01:02:37,793 --> 01:02:40,206
(Maya sighs)

1090
01:02:45,172 --> 01:02:47,792
We have facial recognition
software running.

1091
01:02:47,793 --> 01:02:48,793
We'll find her.

1092
01:02:50,137 --> 01:02:51,457
Hernandez, we
need you out here.

1093
01:02:57,551 --> 01:03:00,241
(ominous music)

1094
01:03:10,379 --> 01:03:13,688
Sorry, Chief, I
gotta find my wife.

1095
01:03:13,689 --> 01:03:16,241
(ominous music)

1096
01:03:44,379 --> 01:03:45,792
Maya!

1097
01:03:45,793 --> 01:03:48,517
(dramatic music)

1098
01:03:53,241 --> 01:03:54,413
Rachelle Turner.

1099
01:04:06,344 --> 01:04:08,655
(tense music)

1100
01:04:19,931 --> 01:04:20,862
What's going on over here?

1101
01:04:20,863 --> 01:04:22,033
Is everything all right?

1102
01:04:22,034 --> 01:04:23,619
Everything's fine, sir.

1103
01:04:23,620 --> 01:04:24,620
Can I help you?

1104
01:04:28,655 --> 01:04:29,655
Ian?

1105
01:04:31,586 --> 01:04:33,102
Mr. Stocklan.

1106
01:04:33,103 --> 01:04:35,033
Heard a commotion
coming from your house.

1107
01:04:35,034 --> 01:04:37,757
I'm sorry, I don't know
what you're talking about.

1108
01:04:37,758 --> 01:04:39,274
Are you feeling all right?

1109
01:04:39,275 --> 01:04:41,205
I'd like to speak
with your wife.

1110
01:04:41,206 --> 01:04:42,654
She's out back
taking out the garbage.

1111
01:04:42,655 --> 01:04:44,619
We had a little accident.

1112
01:04:44,620 --> 01:04:46,102
But I'm sure she'll tell you

1113
01:04:46,103 --> 01:04:48,068
that this was all just
a misunderstanding.

1114
01:04:49,689 --> 01:04:50,689
Here, let me show you.

1115
01:04:50,689 --> 01:04:51,689
Take you out back.

1116
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,655
(ominous music)

1117
01:04:58,758 --> 01:05:00,826
I guess she'll be back.

1118
01:05:00,827 --> 01:05:01,827
Where is she?

1119
01:05:03,172 --> 01:05:04,861
She went to the store.

1120
01:05:04,862 --> 01:05:06,240
It's funny, she
was just out here.

1121
01:05:06,241 --> 01:05:07,826
I heard her scream.

1122
01:05:07,827 --> 01:05:09,206
I saw you hit her!

1123
01:05:10,241 --> 01:05:11,206
I've already called the police.

1124
01:05:11,207 --> 01:05:12,688
They're on their way.

1125
01:05:12,689 --> 01:05:13,930
(dramatic music)

1126
01:05:13,931 --> 01:05:17,206
(Mr. Stocklan gasping)

1127
01:05:42,206 --> 01:05:43,206
Chief!

1128
01:05:45,206 --> 01:05:46,723
Chief!

1129
01:05:46,724 --> 01:05:48,205
So this whole time,

1130
01:05:48,206 --> 01:05:49,826
you've been some sort
of actress, right?

1131
01:05:49,827 --> 01:05:51,274
It's not what you think.

1132
01:05:51,275 --> 01:05:53,343
Well, correct me if I'm wrong.

1133
01:05:53,344 --> 01:05:55,447
I think Rachelle went
to our high school.

1134
01:05:55,448 --> 01:05:56,826
I think you know
that she never worked

1135
01:05:56,827 --> 01:05:57,999
for a nannying company.

1136
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,585
You hired her, independently.

1137
01:06:00,586 --> 01:06:02,999
I think you knew that she
was using a fake name.

1138
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:04,999
Hell, I think you knew
that this whole time,

1139
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,171
she was the one trying
to kidnap our kids.

1140
01:06:07,172 --> 01:06:09,241
They're not your kids.

1141
01:06:12,137 --> 01:06:13,413
No you don't.

1142
01:06:15,103 --> 01:06:18,034
(Maya screaming)

1143
01:06:28,965 --> 01:06:31,448
(tense music)

1144
01:07:02,655 --> 01:07:05,275
(phone chimes)

1145
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:32,895
I got you, Rachelle.

1146
01:07:32,896 --> 01:07:34,136
What's her name?

1147
01:07:34,137 --> 01:07:35,417
What's my girl's
name right here?

1148
01:07:36,827 --> 01:07:38,999
Hmm, oh, wow.

1149
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:40,171
Good job.

1150
01:07:40,172 --> 01:07:42,240
That's nice.

1151
01:07:42,241 --> 01:07:45,619
Okay, so now we should, we
should see if the giraffe...

1152
01:07:45,620 --> 01:07:47,724
(thumping)

1153
01:07:48,827 --> 01:07:49,827
Girls, girls, shh.

1154
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:52,964
Let's play quietly, okay?

1155
01:07:52,965 --> 01:07:55,964
Stay right here
and play quietly.

1156
01:07:55,965 --> 01:07:56,965
I'll be right back.

1157
01:07:59,172 --> 01:08:02,344
(suspenseful music)

1158
01:08:22,896 --> 01:08:25,517
(gentle music)

1159
01:08:29,862 --> 01:08:32,032
Thank God you're all right.

1160
01:08:32,033 --> 01:08:33,517
I was so worried he'd hurt you.

1161
01:08:34,792 --> 01:08:38,102
Thank you for
everything, Rachelle.

1162
01:08:38,103 --> 01:08:39,549
They're safe.

1163
01:08:39,550 --> 01:08:40,413
We did it.

1164
01:08:40,414 --> 01:08:41,517
We got away with it.

1165
01:08:42,862 --> 01:08:43,862
We're not safe yet.

1166
01:08:45,758 --> 01:08:46,862
He knows about you.

1167
01:08:49,689 --> 01:08:51,517
Noelle, Grace.

1168
01:08:53,758 --> 01:08:55,516
Babies, are you there?

1169
01:08:55,517 --> 01:08:57,032
Oh!

1170
01:08:57,033 --> 01:08:58,379
Oh, look at you.

1171
01:08:59,931 --> 01:09:02,826
Oh, I'm so happy to see you.

1172
01:09:02,827 --> 01:09:04,309
Are you guys okay?

1173
01:09:10,137 --> 01:09:12,032
Thank you for
everything, Rachelle.

1174
01:09:12,033 --> 01:09:14,931
You girls always had my
back, ever since high school.

1175
01:09:16,517 --> 01:09:18,448
(laughs) Sis,
you know I got you.

1176
01:09:20,172 --> 01:09:21,792
Sorry I've been
away for so long.

1177
01:09:23,620 --> 01:09:26,343
I still can't forgive myself
for missing the funeral.

1178
01:09:26,344 --> 01:09:28,343
No, what matters is
that you're here now.

1179
01:09:28,344 --> 01:09:30,447
If you weren't traveling
and working so much,

1180
01:09:30,448 --> 01:09:33,032
you wouldn't have
this beautiful ranch.

1181
01:09:33,033 --> 01:09:34,033
Yeah.

1182
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:36,241
And we should be safe here.

1183
01:09:38,482 --> 01:09:40,447
If you would've told
me what was going on,

1184
01:09:40,448 --> 01:09:43,102
I would've left
sooner, seriously.

1185
01:09:43,103 --> 01:09:44,585
Rachelle, no one knew.

1186
01:09:45,792 --> 01:09:47,308
And I was stupid enough

1187
01:09:47,309 --> 01:09:48,949
to think that I could
handle it by myself.

1188
01:09:51,931 --> 01:09:53,032
He was keeping me disoriented,

1189
01:09:53,033 --> 01:09:54,171
away from my family and friends.

1190
01:09:54,172 --> 01:09:55,448
I was done.

1191
01:09:57,309 --> 01:09:59,448
And trust that he would've
tried to pull us apart.

1192
01:10:00,482 --> 01:10:01,482
Never.

1193
01:10:02,862 --> 01:10:04,517
We go too far back for that.

1194
01:10:06,103 --> 01:10:07,620
Everything's gonna be fine now.

1195
01:10:10,482 --> 01:10:13,447
I think me going to the
police station worked,

1196
01:10:13,448 --> 01:10:15,275
made me seem less
suspicious to Ian.

1197
01:10:16,620 --> 01:10:18,205
Yeah, well, I think
it was a good idea

1198
01:10:18,206 --> 01:10:19,308
that I brought that
stupid sandwich

1199
01:10:19,309 --> 01:10:20,549
and pretended it was his lunch!

1200
01:10:21,379 --> 01:10:22,826
You know what?

1201
01:10:22,827 --> 01:10:23,827
That's my girl.

1202
01:10:26,275 --> 01:10:28,585
Sometimes you gotta
laugh instead of crying.

1203
01:10:30,862 --> 01:10:32,241
Rachelle, I'm scared of him.

1204
01:10:33,862 --> 01:10:35,413
That man is dangerous.

1205
01:10:37,620 --> 01:10:39,447
And it's only a matter of time

1206
01:10:39,448 --> 01:10:41,585
before he figures
everything out and finds us.

1207
01:10:43,482 --> 01:10:45,602
That man is never gonna stop
looking for me, Rachelle.

1208
01:10:49,103 --> 01:10:50,413
And I guess his plan worked.

1209
01:10:54,172 --> 01:10:55,344
I'm pregnant.

1210
01:10:58,896 --> 01:11:02,447
So now what's gonna
happen to me and my girls?

1211
01:11:02,448 --> 01:11:04,516
Nothing's gonna happen.

1212
01:11:04,517 --> 01:11:05,862
Our plan won't change.

1213
01:11:07,689 --> 01:11:11,274
I should have left
that man a long time ago,

1214
01:11:11,275 --> 01:11:13,344
but I was afraid that
he would hurt himself

1215
01:11:14,448 --> 01:11:16,378
like his dad did.

1216
01:11:16,379 --> 01:11:18,447
Wait, you never
told me about his dad.

1217
01:11:18,448 --> 01:11:19,655
He was a cop too.

1218
01:11:21,517 --> 01:11:24,861
Struggled with depression
and took his own life,

1219
01:11:24,862 --> 01:11:26,000
right before I met Ian.

1220
01:11:27,758 --> 01:11:29,550
God, I put myself,

1221
01:11:31,931 --> 01:11:35,413
I put my girls in danger
because I pitied him.

1222
01:11:37,689 --> 01:11:39,102
I thought that I could save him

1223
01:11:39,103 --> 01:11:41,655
and in the meantime lost myself.

1224
01:11:43,585 --> 01:11:48,000
Girl, some things we have to
turn over to God and therapy.

1225
01:11:49,585 --> 01:11:51,205
You were never meant
to save that man.

1226
01:11:51,206 --> 01:11:52,412
Yes, but by the
time I realized that,

1227
01:11:52,413 --> 01:11:54,240
he threatened to set me up.

1228
01:11:54,241 --> 01:11:56,516
Just stop it, okay?

1229
01:11:56,517 --> 01:11:58,516
That's why we're here.

1230
01:11:58,517 --> 01:12:00,447
That's why you devised a
plan that's going to work.

1231
01:12:00,448 --> 01:12:01,931
We just have to follow it.

1232
01:12:03,585 --> 01:12:06,584
My friend will have new
IDs for you by morning.

1233
01:12:06,585 --> 01:12:08,584
I'll disappear with the girls

1234
01:12:08,585 --> 01:12:10,343
and you go to the police and
tell them everything you have.

1235
01:12:10,344 --> 01:12:13,102
I just told you, he's
the new lieutenant.

1236
01:12:13,103 --> 01:12:15,034
Everybody over there loves him.

1237
01:12:16,620 --> 01:12:17,964
Now, Rachelle, I'm
trying to tell you

1238
01:12:17,965 --> 01:12:19,654
that I don't know about
this plan anymore.

1239
01:12:19,655 --> 01:12:22,792
No, we're sure about the plan.

1240
01:12:22,793 --> 01:12:24,724
Didn't you say you
trust that lady cop?

1241
01:12:26,344 --> 01:12:27,930
I don't know if I
trust anyone anymore.

1242
01:12:27,931 --> 01:12:29,619
(phone chiming)

1243
01:12:29,620 --> 01:12:32,067
Someone's at the gate.

1244
01:12:32,068 --> 01:12:33,136
Here it is.

1245
01:12:33,137 --> 01:12:34,137
Here.

1246
01:12:37,344 --> 01:12:38,344
We have to go.

1247
01:12:39,137 --> 01:12:40,137
My God.

1248
01:12:46,517 --> 01:12:47,619
My God, we gotta get outta here.

1249
01:12:47,620 --> 01:12:49,308
Okay, go grab the bags.

1250
01:12:49,309 --> 01:12:50,654
There's only one
road in and out.

1251
01:12:50,655 --> 01:12:52,757
They're already on their way.

1252
01:12:52,758 --> 01:12:54,584
Noelle, come on, let's go
to my secret hiding place.

1253
01:12:54,585 --> 01:12:56,102
Let's go, let me show you.

1254
01:12:56,103 --> 01:12:56,965
Here's Mama.

1255
01:12:56,966 --> 01:12:57,999
Hey, baby.

1256
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:59,171
Okay, this is yours.

1257
01:12:59,172 --> 01:13:00,757
I wanna stay here with you.

1258
01:13:00,758 --> 01:13:02,378
No, no, no, no, no,
baby, listen, listen.

1259
01:13:02,379 --> 01:13:03,481
We're just playing
hide and seek, okay?

1260
01:13:03,482 --> 01:13:05,240
I need you to hide for Mommy.

1261
01:13:05,241 --> 01:13:07,550
Just promise me you'll take
care of your sister, okay?

1262
01:13:08,655 --> 01:13:10,378
Okay, I love you so much.

1263
01:13:10,379 --> 01:13:12,549
Okay, you guys get
outta here, okay?

1264
01:13:12,550 --> 01:13:14,448
It'll be just fine,
baby, I promise.

1265
01:13:15,241 --> 01:13:16,137
Got it, baby?

1266
01:13:16,138 --> 01:13:17,378
Come on, okay.

1267
01:13:17,379 --> 01:13:18,447
Got it?

1268
01:13:18,448 --> 01:13:19,448
Alright, let's go.

1269
01:13:27,137 --> 01:13:29,792
(dramatic music)

1270
01:13:29,793 --> 01:13:31,412
Come on.

1271
01:13:31,413 --> 01:13:35,240
Let's go, let's keep
going, go to the right.

1272
01:13:35,241 --> 01:13:36,241
Okay.

1273
01:13:41,965 --> 01:13:42,999
Okay.

1274
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:44,343
Stay right here, okay?

1275
01:13:44,344 --> 01:13:45,655
Until I come and get you.

1276
01:13:47,068 --> 01:13:48,068
Okay.

1277
01:13:50,827 --> 01:13:51,827
Sorry.

1278
01:14:00,206 --> 01:14:01,206
Okay.

1279
01:14:06,724 --> 01:14:07,724
Okay.

1280
01:14:16,241 --> 01:14:18,378
(door slams)

1281
01:14:18,379 --> 01:14:20,378
Forgive me for
bringing you into this.

1282
01:14:20,379 --> 01:14:22,447
That's what sisters are for.

1283
01:14:22,448 --> 01:14:23,517
Okay?

1284
01:14:24,275 --> 01:14:25,275
Maya!

1285
01:14:27,862 --> 01:14:30,930
Baby, I know you're in there.

1286
01:14:30,931 --> 01:14:31,931
Elle!

1287
01:14:33,206 --> 01:14:36,102
Or should I call you Rachelle?

1288
01:14:36,103 --> 01:14:37,654
Come out, both of you,

1289
01:14:37,655 --> 01:14:39,015
or I will come in
and drag you out.

1290
01:14:40,793 --> 01:14:42,793
We're making it outta
this together, you hear me?

1291
01:14:43,758 --> 01:14:45,358
Come on, baby, I'm
giving you a choice!

1292
01:14:46,620 --> 01:14:48,447
That's how you wanna play?

1293
01:14:48,448 --> 01:14:51,068
You can never make things easy
for me, can you, sweetheart?

1294
01:14:52,758 --> 01:14:57,793
(door smashing)
(Maya screaming)

1295
01:15:03,379 --> 01:15:04,793
Come on, come on.

1296
01:15:08,482 --> 01:15:11,068
(Ian grunting)

1297
01:15:25,793 --> 01:15:27,447
Everything's gonna be okay.

1298
01:15:27,448 --> 01:15:28,448
I'll protect you.

1299
01:15:29,689 --> 01:15:31,308
I'll shoot if either
one of you move.

1300
01:15:31,309 --> 01:15:33,792
Do it, coward.

1301
01:15:33,793 --> 01:15:35,481
Where are the girls?

1302
01:15:35,482 --> 01:15:37,619
You will never
see my babies again.

1303
01:15:37,620 --> 01:15:39,412
(Ian laughs)

1304
01:15:39,413 --> 01:15:40,793
Don't you dare.

1305
01:15:42,655 --> 01:15:46,241
If you shoot her, I will
kill myself and your baby.

1306
01:15:50,448 --> 01:15:51,757
Baby, you ain't got it in you.

1307
01:15:51,758 --> 01:15:52,930
I don't believe you.

1308
01:15:52,931 --> 01:15:53,931
Try me.

1309
01:15:56,137 --> 01:15:59,654
(radio chattering)

1310
01:15:59,655 --> 01:16:01,516
No one's here.

1311
01:16:01,517 --> 01:16:02,655
The place is torn up.

1312
01:16:04,103 --> 01:16:05,896
What could he have
done with her?

1313
01:16:07,275 --> 01:16:09,896
If you just let Elle
go, I will go with you.

1314
01:16:11,793 --> 01:16:15,689
I won't hurt myself or our
baby if you just let her go.

1315
01:16:17,103 --> 01:16:18,343
No, no.

1316
01:16:18,344 --> 01:16:20,136
She'll tell everybody.

1317
01:16:20,137 --> 01:16:21,274
Oh, no, no, no, baby, we're
in the middle of nowhere.

1318
01:16:21,275 --> 01:16:22,861
She won't have time.

1319
01:16:22,862 --> 01:16:25,343
Honey, we will be long gone.

1320
01:16:25,344 --> 01:16:26,447
All right?

1321
01:16:26,448 --> 01:16:27,448
You, me, and our family.

1322
01:16:30,034 --> 01:16:31,654
'Cause we're family, right?

1323
01:16:31,655 --> 01:16:32,723
Yes, baby.

1324
01:16:32,724 --> 01:16:33,895
That's right.

1325
01:16:33,896 --> 01:16:35,516
Better than my old man, right?

1326
01:16:35,517 --> 01:16:36,517
And I never abandoned you.

1327
01:16:36,518 --> 01:16:38,171
I never abandoned you.

1328
01:16:38,172 --> 01:16:39,172
No, no, no, no, no.

1329
01:16:39,173 --> 01:16:40,688
You tried to leave me.

1330
01:16:40,689 --> 01:16:42,209
Because pregnancy
makes you confused.

1331
01:16:42,862 --> 01:16:44,171
Okay?

1332
01:16:44,172 --> 01:16:45,688
It's okay.

1333
01:16:45,689 --> 01:16:47,516
I promise you, we
can just leave.

1334
01:16:47,517 --> 01:16:49,274
We can get out of town,

1335
01:16:49,275 --> 01:16:52,412
and I promise you, promise you
that I will obey this time.

1336
01:16:52,413 --> 01:16:54,102
Okay?

1337
01:16:54,103 --> 01:16:59,068
All you have to do
is let Rachelle go.

1338
01:16:59,758 --> 01:17:01,584
Ian, come on.

1339
01:17:01,585 --> 01:17:03,308
You know how to
make us disappear.

1340
01:17:03,309 --> 01:17:04,654
Yeah?

1341
01:17:04,655 --> 01:17:06,308
Yeah.

1342
01:17:06,309 --> 01:17:09,619
Listen, Ian, she'll
just slow us down.

1343
01:17:09,620 --> 01:17:11,308
Just let her go.

1344
01:17:11,309 --> 01:17:13,481
She serves no purpose,
honey, come on,

1345
01:17:13,482 --> 01:17:16,067
it's just us and the family.

1346
01:17:16,068 --> 01:17:18,379
Elle, get outta here
before I change my mind.

1347
01:17:19,309 --> 01:17:20,309
Go!

1348
01:17:21,448 --> 01:17:23,034
It's okay, it's okay, go, go!

1349
01:17:33,931 --> 01:17:34,896
Hello?

1350
01:17:34,897 --> 01:17:36,792
Can somebody hear me?

1351
01:17:36,793 --> 01:17:37,826
Hello, hello?

1352
01:17:37,827 --> 01:17:39,654
Can somebody hear me?

1353
01:17:39,655 --> 01:17:41,206
We need help, hello.

1354
01:18:00,620 --> 01:18:02,862
How do I know
you won't shoot me?

1355
01:18:04,413 --> 01:18:06,549
Baby, I have my priorities
straight, all right?

1356
01:18:06,550 --> 01:18:07,448
Okay.

1357
01:18:07,449 --> 01:18:09,308
Okay.

1358
01:18:09,309 --> 01:18:10,792
Just put the gun down so
I know you won't hurt me.

1359
01:18:10,793 --> 01:18:12,584
All right.

1360
01:18:12,585 --> 01:18:14,275
All right, it's
going away, okay?

1361
01:18:15,241 --> 01:18:17,516
It's gone, okay?

1362
01:18:17,517 --> 01:18:18,827
Baby, put the knife down.

1363
01:18:20,309 --> 01:18:21,965
Come on, put it down.

1364
01:18:23,275 --> 01:18:24,275
Okay.

1365
01:18:31,344 --> 01:18:32,688
Okay, come here.

1366
01:18:32,689 --> 01:18:34,103
Come here, baby.

1367
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:39,412
Okay, now where did you stash
the girls over here, right?

1368
01:18:39,413 --> 01:18:43,619
Tell 'em that daddy's home to
come save the day, all right?

1369
01:18:43,620 --> 01:18:45,481
Okay?
Okay.

1370
01:18:45,482 --> 01:18:48,137
You can just stay right
here and I'll go get them.

1371
01:18:51,413 --> 01:18:53,793
How should I explain
all this to the girls?

1372
01:18:55,137 --> 01:18:58,275
Just, just tell 'em
the truth, baby, okay?

1373
01:19:00,172 --> 01:19:01,999
Tell 'em that Elle made Mommy
and Daddy fight, all right,

1374
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,412
and now she's gone and
she'll never come back, okay?

1375
01:19:04,413 --> 01:19:05,792
Okay, okay.

1376
01:19:05,793 --> 01:19:07,826
Would you mind getting my car?

1377
01:19:07,827 --> 01:19:10,033
Because yours is gonna
be too easy to track.

1378
01:19:10,034 --> 01:19:10,793
What are you talking about?

1379
01:19:10,794 --> 01:19:11,930
I'm not stupid.

1380
01:19:11,931 --> 01:19:12,758
No, no, no, Ian, I
know that you're not-

1381
01:19:12,759 --> 01:19:13,895
(Maya screaming)

1382
01:19:13,896 --> 01:19:16,172
(dramatic music)

1383
01:19:27,034 --> 01:19:29,412
(children screaming)

1384
01:19:29,413 --> 01:19:30,723
Oh, babies, babies.

1385
01:19:30,724 --> 01:19:31,585
- Mommy!
- I love you so much.

1386
01:19:31,586 --> 01:19:32,654
Come on.
What's going on?

1387
01:19:32,655 --> 01:19:34,688
It's okay, baby, everything's
gonna be just fine.

1388
01:19:34,689 --> 01:19:36,000
Come on now, hurry.

1389
01:19:38,137 --> 01:19:40,792
We're fine, baby, we're fine!

1390
01:19:40,793 --> 01:19:42,757
Okay, Noelle, don't
hurt yourself!

1391
01:19:42,758 --> 01:19:44,861
Okay, Noelle, go
in the other side.

1392
01:19:44,862 --> 01:19:45,758
Go in the other side.

1393
01:19:45,759 --> 01:19:47,240
Okay, Grace, let's get in here.

1394
01:19:47,241 --> 01:19:49,103
(Ian grunting)

1395
01:19:54,517 --> 01:19:55,930
Okay.

1396
01:19:55,931 --> 01:19:57,965
Come on, Elle, come on!

1397
01:19:58,550 --> 01:20:00,240
It's okay, baby.

1398
01:20:00,241 --> 01:20:00,931
It's okay.

1399
01:20:00,932 --> 01:20:02,549
You guys okay?

1400
01:20:02,550 --> 01:20:03,861
(Elle) Yeah, we need
to go, we need to go!

1401
01:20:03,862 --> 01:20:05,240
(gun fires)
Ian, no!

1402
01:20:05,241 --> 01:20:07,205
Ian, the girls are in the car!

1403
01:20:07,206 --> 01:20:08,034
Stop it!

1404
01:20:08,035 --> 01:20:09,447
Oh my God, what do I do?

1405
01:20:09,448 --> 01:20:11,205
Elle, what do I do?

1406
01:20:11,206 --> 01:20:14,516
I don't know, drive the car!

1407
01:20:14,517 --> 01:20:17,206
(Maya screaming)

1408
01:20:20,413 --> 01:20:23,034
(siren wailing)

1409
01:20:26,793 --> 01:20:29,102
(Liz) Maya, Rachelle,
are you all right?

1410
01:20:29,103 --> 01:20:30,103
Yeah.

1411
01:20:31,517 --> 01:20:32,619
Ian, he...

1412
01:20:32,620 --> 01:20:33,620
Where is he?

1413
01:20:36,309 --> 01:20:40,067
Right there.

1414
01:20:40,068 --> 01:20:44,481
Lieutenant Flynn, you have
the right to remain silent.

1415
01:20:44,482 --> 01:20:46,240
Anything you say...

1416
01:20:46,241 --> 01:20:48,550
(tense music)

1417
01:21:24,862 --> 01:21:26,481
Right.

1418
01:21:26,482 --> 01:21:28,205
♪ Merrily, merrily,
merrily, merrily ♪

1419
01:21:28,206 --> 01:21:30,033
♪ Life is but a dream

1420
01:21:30,034 --> 01:21:31,861
Good job today!

1421
01:21:31,862 --> 01:21:33,378
Oh my gosh.

1422
01:21:33,379 --> 01:21:35,861
All right, I'll
see you tomorrow.

1423
01:21:35,862 --> 01:21:37,757
Whew, good job!

1424
01:21:37,758 --> 01:21:40,033
They love you so much.

1425
01:21:40,034 --> 01:21:42,136
They're gonna be so upset
when you leave again.

1426
01:21:42,137 --> 01:21:43,344
I won't be gone long.

1427
01:21:44,862 --> 01:21:46,481
Thanks for covering
my class for me.

1428
01:21:46,482 --> 01:21:48,033
Of course.

1429
01:21:48,034 --> 01:21:49,068
It's my pleasure.

1430
01:21:50,413 --> 01:21:53,619
(gentle music)

1431
01:21:53,620 --> 01:21:54,757
That used to be the song.

1432
01:21:54,758 --> 01:21:55,930
So good to see you ladies.

1433
01:21:55,931 --> 01:21:57,481
You too, you too.

1434
01:21:57,482 --> 01:21:58,964
Wow, so catch us up.

1435
01:21:58,965 --> 01:22:00,136
What's been going on?

1436
01:22:00,137 --> 01:22:01,930
Tell us about the station.

1437
01:22:01,931 --> 01:22:04,516
Well, it's a lot more work,

1438
01:22:04,517 --> 01:22:07,655
but being promoted to
Chief is a huge honor.

1439
01:22:10,344 --> 01:22:12,447
Are you guys gonna
drink that in front of me?

1440
01:22:12,448 --> 01:22:14,895
Ah, come on, we can
give you a little whiff.

1441
01:22:14,896 --> 01:22:15,999
Oh, thank you.

1442
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:17,516
Yeah, yeah, great.

1443
01:22:17,517 --> 01:22:19,413
Oh, did you see
today's headline?

1444
01:22:21,931 --> 01:22:23,826
Oh my God, everything
happened so fast.

1445
01:22:23,827 --> 01:22:25,447
It doesn't seem real.

1446
01:22:25,448 --> 01:22:27,412
Please, after all
that's happened,

1447
01:22:27,413 --> 01:22:29,826
he was a strain
on the department.

1448
01:22:29,827 --> 01:22:31,413
They were happy to wrap that up.

1449
01:22:32,931 --> 01:22:34,033
And I don't know
if I ever told you,

1450
01:22:34,034 --> 01:22:36,205
but in the middle of all this,

1451
01:22:36,206 --> 01:22:38,861
I thought it was you that
was behind everything.

1452
01:22:38,862 --> 01:22:42,000
I could have swore I was gonna
see your face on the news.

1453
01:22:43,689 --> 01:22:45,274
Yeah, well, if you think
she's scandalous now,

1454
01:22:45,275 --> 01:22:46,861
you should have seen
her in high school.

1455
01:22:46,862 --> 01:22:49,102
And I plead the fifth.

1456
01:22:49,103 --> 01:22:51,826
(laughs) You better
plead the fifth.

1457
01:22:51,827 --> 01:22:53,654
So how far along are you?

1458
01:22:53,655 --> 01:22:56,240
Ah, second trimester.

1459
01:22:56,241 --> 01:22:59,068
You think the third time
around would be easier, but no.

1460
01:23:00,517 --> 01:23:03,102
That's why I'm happy
I got my girl back.

1461
01:23:03,103 --> 01:23:04,654
She's gonna help me
out with the other two

1462
01:23:04,655 --> 01:23:06,930
while I go back to teaching.

1463
01:23:06,931 --> 01:23:07,931
Yay!

1464
01:23:09,413 --> 01:23:11,034
You know what you're having?

1465
01:23:12,413 --> 01:23:14,550
A boy.

1466
01:23:16,931 --> 01:23:18,379
Well, ain't that something?

1467
01:23:19,379 --> 01:23:20,792
It is.

1468
01:23:20,793 --> 01:23:22,274
So when is the baby shower?

1469
01:23:22,275 --> 01:23:23,584
'Cause that's what
I'm talking about.

1470
01:23:23,585 --> 01:23:25,999
How about a destination
baby shower?

1471
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:27,240
I'm talking Cabo.

1472
01:23:27,241 --> 01:23:29,758
Look, we could go to Jamaica!

1473
01:23:31,413 --> 01:23:34,757
