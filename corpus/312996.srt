1
00:00:03,297 --> 00:00:05,779
I said 'Shut up, you stupid twat' And...

2
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:06,972
- Oh my God.
- I know.

3
00:00:06,973 --> 00:00:10,214
Because... And then I'm like:
'Oh fuck, what did I just do?'

4
00:00:10,215 --> 00:00:13,447
But then the audience loved it.
They went nuts.

5
00:00:13,448 --> 00:00:19,152
And she looked like an idiot, like they're all like,
she is a stupid twat that should shut up.

6
00:00:19,153 --> 00:00:22,219
- That's awesome.
- So it was like felt really good. So that's on the record.

7
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:27,688
It's all like... So many more copies.
Called someone a stupid twat on it.

8
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:31,276
Who knows. I just glut out
the record finally.

9
00:00:31,277 --> 00:00:33,095
It's so good, so good.

10
00:00:33,096 --> 00:00:35,688
Perhaps I'm a bit producing it. It's crazy.

11
00:00:35,689 --> 00:00:36,689
Wow!

12
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:41,962
And then this book. The stupid idea
I had about how guys are jerks.

13
00:00:41,963 --> 00:00:43,775
I went on Oprah with it.

14
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:47,345
Oh my God, why didn't you tell me?
I would have loved to see that.

15
00:00:47,346 --> 00:00:50,425
I didn't know how would it go,
I wanted it away. You know.

16
00:00:51,243 --> 00:00:53,704
- Can I come on to?
- Yeah, for sure.

17
00:00:53,705 --> 00:00:55,728
Oh my God, that's so cool.

18
00:00:55,729 --> 00:00:58,461
What's going on with you?
What about that pilot?

19
00:00:58,462 --> 00:01:00,737
- I got it.
- Awesome.

20
00:01:00,739 --> 00:01:05,514
I know. I'm waiting to hear for it's gonna get picked up.
And that looks really good. They really like it.

21
00:01:05,515 --> 00:01:06,515
Awesome!

22
00:01:06,516 --> 00:01:07,516
It's so great!

23
00:01:07,517 --> 00:01:09,240
And Dacky was in it.

24
00:01:09,241 --> 00:01:14,939
Cause I brought him to the table reading they needed
a dog for one scene and then like "He's perfect"

25
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:16,734
He is perfect.

26
00:01:17,553 --> 00:01:20,992
And then I sold that script
to this Comedy Central.

27
00:01:20,993 --> 00:01:23,250
- A sports thing.
- Sport show of all things.

28
00:01:23,251 --> 00:01:25,433
I know. I don't even know
anything about sports.

29
00:01:25,434 --> 00:01:26,434
Who loves.

30
00:01:28,215 --> 00:01:30,213
It's concept, I guess.

31
00:01:30,214 --> 00:01:32,896
What about a...
What about you?

32
00:01:32,897 --> 00:01:35,387
What's been going on?
I haven't seen you in a while.

33
00:01:37,983 --> 00:01:39,713
So much.

34
00:01:39,714 --> 00:01:42,533
- Wow, really?
- Yeah.

35
00:01:42,534 --> 00:01:46,337
I'm doing a lot. So...

36
00:01:46,338 --> 00:01:48,042
You've been getting out a lot.

37
00:01:48,043 --> 00:01:52,177
I actually wrote a show.

38
00:01:52,178 --> 00:01:53,137
Wow, cool.

39
00:01:53,138 --> 00:01:55,441
Are you shopping it around or...?

40
00:01:55,835 --> 00:02:00,071
No it's doing it.
I mean it's...

41
00:02:02,022 --> 00:02:07,648
- I mean it's gonna be on. It's a show.
- On TV?

42
00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:16,156
No, but it's actually
like a play slash movie.

43
00:02:16,157 --> 00:02:18,478
- It's cool. Like in a theatre.
- Wow.

44
00:02:18,975 --> 00:02:20,288
Yeah.

45
00:02:20,289 --> 00:02:26,804
It sounds amazing. What is it? What's it about?
Are you like the star of it? What is it?

46
00:02:26,805 --> 00:02:29,521
It's about a ...

47
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:34,706
the Holocaust.

48
00:02:34,707 --> 00:02:40,139
Yeah. And it's kind of a...

49
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:42,525
But it's funny.

50
00:02:44,102 --> 00:02:48,038
And it's also musical.

51
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:51,114
- Oh my God, that sounds awesome.
- I know.

52
00:02:51,115 --> 00:02:52,621
When are you doing it?

53
00:02:52,622 --> 00:02:54,750
It's a real opus, you know.

54
00:02:54,751 --> 00:03:03,643
You know what, tonight. And it's
actually tonight so I'd better skid detail.

55
00:03:03,644 --> 00:03:08,518
- Right now?
- Yeah. I've got a bunch of stuff to do pre-pro.

56
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:12,035
Can we come see it?
I wanna see it.

57
00:03:14,434 --> 00:03:21,157
Shit. It sold out. It's totally sold out,
every scene. I know, it sucks.

58
00:03:21,158 --> 00:03:25,313
What if we just hang backstage and
like watch from the wings or something?

59
00:03:25,314 --> 00:03:29,787
Yeah. Can we just be backstage?

60
00:03:30,263 --> 00:03:34,178
We can stand by the
curtains and be quiet.

61
00:03:34,179 --> 00:03:36,728
I can't think why not.

62
00:03:40,145 --> 00:03:43,355
- So will you let us know...?
- Yeah, sure, definitely.

63
00:03:43,356 --> 00:03:46,223
I'm excited. I'm totally excited.

64
00:03:46,224 --> 00:03:48,563
So see you guys tonight.

65
00:03:48,564 --> 00:03:50,509
- Good luck.
- See you at the show.

66
00:03:58,223 --> 00:03:59,600
Fuck!

67
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:10,295
"Here I go again with my big mouth."

68
00:04:10,296 --> 00:04:13,892
"Spelling off like I got some going."

69
00:04:13,893 --> 00:04:17,076
"I wrote a show and it's playing tonight?"

70
00:04:17,077 --> 00:04:20,670
"I'm so foolish shit man. What was I thinking?"

71
00:04:20,671 --> 00:04:27,502
"I gotta write a show but how am I gonna
do a show. And I don't even have a show to write."

72
00:04:27,503 --> 00:04:34,504
"I never wrote a show, but if I ever wrote a show,
I bet that all of them would know and thinking bites."

73
00:04:34,505 --> 00:04:37,301
"You know what. Fuck down."

74
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:40,464
"I could write a show."

75
00:04:40,465 --> 00:04:45,161
"I could write a show. I'll just do it."

76
00:04:46,075 --> 00:04:48,216
"I'll write a show."

77
00:04:48,217 --> 00:04:51,254
"All it takes is elbow grease"

78
00:04:51,255 --> 00:04:53,353
"And I could write a show."

79
00:04:53,354 --> 00:04:56,488
"I'll write a show tonight."

80
00:04:56,489 --> 00:05:00,015
"I hope I do it right."

81
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:07,283
"I could take this mixed up
world and put it in a show."

82
00:05:07,284 --> 00:05:10,980
"I'll write a show alright."

83
00:05:10,981 --> 00:05:13,548
"And I'll have it by tonight."

84
00:05:15,786 --> 00:05:22,018
"All I need is a theatre space
and a bag of weed and a star."

85
00:05:22,019 --> 00:05:23,548
"A star!"

86
00:05:23,549 --> 00:05:24,639
"Great!"

87
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:30,410
"Good job, Sarah. I'm writing a whole show for tonight.
I don't even have a star. Who's gonna be my star?"

88
00:05:30,411 --> 00:05:33,803
"She's gotta be pretty and
she's gotta be smart."

89
00:05:33,804 --> 00:05:36,684
"She's gotta be funny and
she's gotta be hot."

90
00:05:36,685 --> 00:05:40,478
"She's gotta have a perfect
smile just like me."

91
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:43,801
"I just need a star
but who could it be?"

92
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:44,985
"Julia Roberts?"

93
00:05:44,986 --> 00:05:46,804
"Nah."

94
00:05:46,805 --> 00:05:48,350
"Nicole Kidman?"

95
00:05:48,351 --> 00:05:50,375
"Are you kidding, man?"

96
00:05:50,376 --> 00:05:51,835
"Sandra Bullock?"

97
00:05:52,731 --> 00:05:53,863
"Sandra Bullock."

98
00:05:57,034 --> 00:06:00,959
"She's gotta be the kind of
girl that blows your mind,"

99
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,495
"She ought to be better than
those three twats combined."

100
00:06:04,498 --> 00:06:11,238
"She's gotta have a thing
that you just can't define."

101
00:06:14,464 --> 00:06:16,429
Me.

102
00:06:17,869 --> 00:06:19,358
It's me.

103
00:06:22,996 --> 00:06:25,146
You are beautiful.

104
00:06:35,001 --> 00:06:36,437
No.

105
00:06:37,135 --> 00:06:38,734
Not like this.

106
00:06:42,298 --> 00:06:43,588
Alright.

107
00:06:43,589 --> 00:06:45,379
I'll do it.

108
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:52,227
"I got what it takes. Got what it needs.
Got what a show needs."

109
00:06:52,228 --> 00:06:59,102
"I, I'll show them more, little of me.
I'm what the world needs."

110
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:05,502
"Hear the train coming
it's coming for me."

111
00:07:05,503 --> 00:07:07,619
"I'm going to Star Town."

112
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:10,700
"Hear the train coming it's coming for me."

113
00:07:10,701 --> 00:07:13,636
"I'm gonna be a star now."

114
00:07:13,637 --> 00:07:16,069
I'm a comedian, that's what I do.

115
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:18,419
How do we become whatever
it is that we become?

116
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:21,951
How is he a lawyer,
how is she a hooker?

117
00:07:21,952 --> 00:07:24,897
How are we whatever
it is we become?

118
00:07:24,898 --> 00:07:30,600
I think what it is, it's like
as we grow up from child.

119
00:07:30,601 --> 00:07:37,461
You know. In our childhood we have all these disfunctions and
they kind of... they melt together and they form a formula.

120
00:07:37,462 --> 00:07:41,484
An individual formula,
it drives us to be whatever it is.

121
00:07:41,485 --> 00:07:47,731
We're driven to be, you know. For comedians
it's definitely like any kind of humiliation, you know.

122
00:07:47,732 --> 00:07:49,067
I know for me.

123
00:07:49,068 --> 00:08:02,810
I was a bad wetter willing to my teens.  And continue
to have a bevy of, you know, unwanted hairs. And I...

124
00:08:05,328 --> 00:08:15,449
I was raped by a doctor, which is
a so bitter-sweet for a Jewish girl.

125
00:08:19,231 --> 00:08:20,744
Thank you.

126
00:08:22,907 --> 00:08:25,825
I knew something good
would come out of that.

127
00:08:25,826 --> 00:08:28,207
Out of rape.

128
00:08:30,252 --> 00:08:31,341
I am...

129
00:08:31,342 --> 00:08:38,393
I wear this saint Christopher medal sometimes because
I'm Jewish but my boyfriend is Catholic and it was just....

130
00:08:38,394 --> 00:08:44,324
It was cute the way he gave it to me, you know.
He said if it doesn't burn through my skin it will protect me.

131
00:08:47,329 --> 00:08:50,907
Who cares. Different religions,
you know. I mean...

132
00:08:50,908 --> 00:08:54,409
I guess if you in time with an issue, I suppose
would be like if you're having a baby...

133
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,658
You got to figure out like how
you wanna raise your baby.

134
00:08:57,772 --> 00:09:05,011
...or whatever, you know. Which wouldn't even still
not be an issue for us because we'd be honest, you know...

135
00:09:05,012 --> 00:09:12,751
... and just say, you know like Mammy
is one of the chosen people and ...

136
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:17,270
... and daddy believes
that Jesus is magic.

137
00:09:20,467 --> 00:09:22,436
That's not nice.

138
00:09:24,006 --> 00:09:30,549
You know Jesus is magic you know
because he turn water to wine and he...

139
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:34,859
I think he made the
Stature of Liberty disappear.

140
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,580
... or something.

141
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:41,521
You know that Jews got all,
you know they don't want.

142
00:09:41,522 --> 00:09:45,923
But then Jesus movie came out, you know,
and but now the Jews didn't want people to see it.

143
00:09:45,924 --> 00:09:47,872
Because they felt...

144
00:09:47,873 --> 00:09:53,847
Everybody blames the Jews for killing Christ
and then the Jews try to pass it off on the Romans.

145
00:09:53,848 --> 00:09:57,956
I'm one of the few people that
believes it was the blacks.

146
00:10:01,772 --> 00:10:08,779
I don't care. Good. I hope the Jews did kill Christ.
I'd do it again, I'd fucking do it again on the second.

147
00:10:09,412 --> 00:10:11,880
By here is breaking stocks clacking.

148
00:10:11,881 --> 00:10:13,268
This way.

149
00:10:21,535 --> 00:10:26,236
My boyfriend and I were on like second or
third stage, you know, we're like...

150
00:10:26,237 --> 00:10:28,503
...we're finally comfortable.
You know around.

151
00:10:28,504 --> 00:10:34,158
Like I'm finally comfortable enough to pee in front
of my boyfriend, which is so great, you know.

152
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:36,414
Cause now I'm gonna try
it in the bathroom.

153
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:38,647
And...

154
00:10:38,648 --> 00:10:44,767
...we take showers together
and you know it's really...

155
00:10:44,768 --> 00:10:54,383
I guarantee if you take a shower with your boyfriend, by the time
you step out of that shower your breasts will be sparkling clean.

156
00:10:54,384 --> 00:10:56,183
Sparkle in.

157
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:05,939
I was licking jelly out of my boyfriend's
penis and all of a sudden...

158
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:09,575
...all of a sudden I'm thinking "Oh my God,
I'm turning into my mother."

159
00:11:09,576 --> 00:11:11,232
You know it's like...

160
00:11:13,084 --> 00:11:15,092
Those clues. You know.

161
00:11:15,093 --> 00:11:17,906
Of becoming our parents. It's scary.

162
00:11:19,243 --> 00:11:22,011
So scary.

163
00:11:22,012 --> 00:11:25,125
Try to get that lilts like that.

164
00:11:25,126 --> 00:11:27,880
It's a fun. What if fun cut.

165
00:11:27,881 --> 00:11:30,729
So scary.

166
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:33,973
Can I steal you for a minute?
Like that kind of voice.

167
00:11:33,974 --> 00:11:35,093
I'm so into that.

168
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:37,115
I don't know why it's fun.

169
00:11:40,798 --> 00:11:45,320
Can I steal you for a minute?

170
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:50,400
I'm on a birth control pill.
Cause I do a lot of fucking.

171
00:11:53,214 --> 00:11:57,658
But I want like I wanna try something else,
because it's really hormonian and...

172
00:11:57,659 --> 00:12:01,383
I'm always looking... I'm always asking my
friends what they use for birth control.

173
00:12:01,384 --> 00:12:07,395
...take a little poll, like I ask my friend
Charlie what he and his wife use for birth controlling.

174
00:12:07,396 --> 00:12:11,470
He said he just cums
all over her face.

175
00:12:17,584 --> 00:12:19,254
I'm gonna try that.

176
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:29,514
He has kids already. My boyfriend, he has kids. I mean they’re like...
He's got a boy and a girl, they’re nine and eleven.  And they’re great.

177
00:12:29,515 --> 00:12:36,245
You know what, he actually made them those
ages to commemorate 911, which I hate.

178
00:12:37,947 --> 00:12:40,409
You know it has a lot more than a pin.

179
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:47,535
I always think like I should get on it
if I wanna have kids. I just...

180
00:12:47,536 --> 00:12:54,827
You know, once you had thirty you know you've got to decide fast
Cause it can be difficult to conceive, it can be dangerous.

181
00:12:54,828 --> 00:12:57,507
And the best time to have a baby
is when you're black teenager.

182
00:13:11,173 --> 00:13:15,997
I'm not like a hoydie-toydie kind of girl.

183
00:13:15,998 --> 00:13:18,547
I don’t wanna jewels. I'm not like...

184
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:21,675
I don't really... I'm not into jewelry or anything.

185
00:13:21,676 --> 00:13:22,676
I'm such a hypocrite.

186
00:13:23,167 --> 00:13:26,996
There's a jewel that I think is ...
I guess I'm in such a jap.

187
00:13:26,997 --> 00:13:35,402
There is one jewel that I think is stunning. That I...
It's just like a classic. By jap I mean Japanese.

188
00:13:35,403 --> 00:13:41,111
But it's a... It's just gorgeous. You know.
And it's really... It’s rare.

189
00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:47,294
You know it's only found like on the tip of
the tailbone of Ethiopian babies.

190
00:13:49,955 --> 00:13:52,205
They debone the babies.

191
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:55,740
I know that sounds so bad
when you say it out aloud.

192
00:13:55,741 --> 00:14:00,126
But no, if you saw it...

193
00:14:01,556 --> 00:14:04,047
So worth it.

194
00:14:04,048 --> 00:14:06,813
You know it's like...
How do I even describe it like a...

195
00:14:06,814 --> 00:14:12,240
...like if a diamond had
that newborn baby smell.

196
00:14:15,222 --> 00:14:28,208
I have a moral issue with it obviously cause they're
treating the unions that debone the babies really bad.

197
00:14:29,332 --> 00:14:32,452
Pick your battles I guess. It's so cute.

198
00:14:36,245 --> 00:14:40,688
I can't wait till Sunday I'm gonna see my
favorite niece and my other niece.

199
00:14:42,488 --> 00:14:50,614
I shouldn't have favorites, I know I shouldn't but I just
can't help that she is crazy about me and I just love that in people.

200
00:14:50,615 --> 00:14:58,583
And I can make her laugh so easily. I've always been able
to make her laugh. Like literally since she was a baby.

201
00:14:58,584 --> 00:15:01,015
I could make her laugh, which is so great.

202
00:15:01,016 --> 00:15:03,134
And you know what babies love.

203
00:15:03,135 --> 00:15:05,672
Ethnic jokes.

204
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:13,765
She came out of the closet
recently, my niece.

205
00:15:13,766 --> 00:15:16,631
Announced to the family that she is a lesbian.

206
00:15:16,632 --> 00:15:19,348
She is seven. Did I mention that?

207
00:15:19,349 --> 00:15:24,792
And I don't even know she knows what a
lesbian is. But I support her completely.

208
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:27,567
I'll tell you it's heartbreaking.

209
00:15:29,615 --> 00:15:32,693
My sister punished her for it.

210
00:15:32,694 --> 00:15:35,571
Can you believe that?

211
00:15:35,572 --> 00:15:37,987
No pussy for a week.

212
00:15:37,988 --> 00:15:48,849
Which to us may not sound likable, but when you're seven.
You know, week is a long time. You know. It's like...

213
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:56,691
She goes to a school where the kids are not
allowed to play tag on the playground.

214
00:15:58,023 --> 00:16:05,458
And the reason that they give is that they say, you know,
if a kid loses a tag it could give him low self-esteem.

215
00:16:07,206 --> 00:16:10,614
First of all it's fucking retarded. Okay.

216
00:16:10,615 --> 00:16:13,662
And, I'm sorry. I know I shouldn't say that.

217
00:16:13,663 --> 00:16:17,074
And by retarded I mean,
they can do anything.

218
00:16:23,781 --> 00:16:30,965
I think self-esteem is born out of things like,
you know, I don't know preserving pasts...

219
00:16:30,966 --> 00:16:39,072
...losing, you know, or getting through disappointment. Like that.
Maybe we should be giving these kids a reason to win.

220
00:16:39,073 --> 00:16:41,506
We should be giving them motivation....

221
00:16:41,507 --> 00:16:43,859
...you know, to win.

222
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:48,739
I tell my niece every time she
loses a tag an angel get AIDS.

223
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:50,435
For instance.

224
00:16:53,116 --> 00:16:55,558
You have to speak her language.
You know what I mean.

225
00:16:55,559 --> 00:17:01,080
I tell her, you know, that a beautiful angel...

226
00:17:01,205 --> 00:17:03,708
...gets full blown-ins.

227
00:17:06,913 --> 00:17:09,402
And you know what, she wins.

228
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:11,860
So think about that.

229
00:17:11,861 --> 00:17:15,605
I tell her that when God gives you AIDS...

230
00:17:15,606 --> 00:17:18,927
When God does give you
AIDS by the way? I don't know.

231
00:17:20,874 --> 00:17:23,390
Make lemonades.

232
00:17:27,449 --> 00:17:30,061
It's called, it's positive spin. You know.

233
00:17:30,062 --> 00:17:31,212
I mean it's...

234
00:17:31,213 --> 00:17:34,137
That's what we should steal
from corporate America, you know.

235
00:17:34,138 --> 00:17:39,033
That's what we should steal, one positive
thing we should take from the man, you know.

236
00:17:39,034 --> 00:17:47,742
Is positive spin. The whole idea of taking something terrible,
something tragic and spin it up into something good.

237
00:17:47,743 --> 00:17:55,330
And if American Airlines were smart their slogan would be:
"American Airlines - first through the towers."

238
00:18:00,684 --> 00:18:05,836
Because it is something in which
they came firsts. Right?

239
00:18:05,837 --> 00:18:06,706
Right.

240
00:18:08,573 --> 00:18:14,659
Obviously I'm not trying to be literal
of the events of the September 11.

241
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:19,521
They were devastating. And
they were beyond devastating.

242
00:18:19,522 --> 00:18:24,524
You know, I don’t wanna say especially for
these people or especially for these people.

243
00:18:24,525 --> 00:18:26,307
But especially for me.

244
00:18:27,979 --> 00:18:38,441
Because it happened to be the same exact day that
found out that the soy cholate is like 900 calories.

245
00:18:40,757 --> 00:18:43,666
I had been drinking them everyday.

246
00:18:45,128 --> 00:18:50,077
Cause you hear soy.
You know you think healthy.

247
00:18:50,078 --> 00:18:51,541
And it's a lie.

248
00:18:55,881 --> 00:18:59,754
But it was also the day we were attacked.

249
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:05,722
Devastating.

250
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:14,566
Remember the rage, you know. And then
there is no place to put it. Where do you put it?

251
00:19:14,567 --> 00:19:17,814
I'll tell you what I did
- domain names.

252
00:19:20,587 --> 00:19:26,792
I bought OsamaBinLaden.com,
OsamaBinLaden.net, OsamaBinLaden.org.

253
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,239
And who's he gotta come to, big ass.

254
00:19:33,913 --> 00:19:36,515
Guess what, it's not for sale.

255
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:47,130
Looks like you're gonna have to be Osama 1.

256
00:19:50,141 --> 00:19:53,141
And then who is laughing last - America.

257
00:19:53,142 --> 00:19:55,864
America is.

258
00:19:57,729 --> 00:20:03,607
Was a tough year for me, I actually... it was the
same year I suit my manager for sexual harassment.

259
00:20:03,608 --> 00:20:08,373
which, I don't know if you know anything
about show business, but something that...

260
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:13,327
...boy, you know for a struggling actress to
suit her manager out here in Hollywood

261
00:20:13,328 --> 00:20:18,637
It's something that ...
It takes a lot of guts to do. You know.

262
00:20:18,638 --> 00:20:22,051
Especially because he didn't do anything.

263
00:20:25,402 --> 00:20:29,311
We were in Scotland for a tress camp.

264
00:20:29,312 --> 00:20:31,019
The whole agency went.

265
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:33,954
Oh Jesus!

266
00:20:33,955 --> 00:20:36,671
- That's horrible. What happened?
- What the fuck is this, Karl?

267
00:20:36,672 --> 00:20:37,441
You got fire.

268
00:20:37,442 --> 00:20:39,132
What?

269
00:20:39,133 --> 00:20:40,155
What!?

270
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:42,047
Wochie water.

271
00:20:42,048 --> 00:20:45,745
I'm fucking jam this up somebody's ass.

272
00:20:45,746 --> 00:20:48,985
I mean come on Sarah.
You asked for it.

273
00:20:48,986 --> 00:20:52,057
I asked you for use your jam up your own ass, Karl.

274
00:20:52,058 --> 00:20:53,803
Would you ask me for it?

275
00:20:53,804 --> 00:20:57,418
Fidgy water! I only drink Fidgy water

276
00:20:58,981 --> 00:21:01,040
Did you ask for Fidgy water?

277
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:03,716
Cause I'll...

278
00:21:03,717 --> 00:21:07,428
Okay, now I'm mad.

279
00:21:07,429 --> 00:21:09,798
Now you got me mad.

280
00:21:09,799 --> 00:21:12,811
I don't drink this water.
It tastes thick.

281
00:21:12,812 --> 00:21:16,433
Listen to me. I would break down
walls for you okay?

282
00:21:16,434 --> 00:21:24,488
I will go into my guy's office and I will personally,
you know, masturbate him into a cup for you.

283
00:21:24,489 --> 00:21:26,175
Is that what you want?

284
00:21:26,176 --> 00:21:28,009
What do you want me to do?

285
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:31,792
You wanna me go liposuction Herbie Weinstein...

286
00:21:31,793 --> 00:21:33,651
...and give you some of his fat?

287
00:21:33,652 --> 00:21:37,154
What is it you dream of?
I wanna be a part of a Sarah's dream.

288
00:21:38,519 --> 00:21:42,737
I want you to take your dreams and
I want you to use me as a tool.

289
00:21:42,738 --> 00:21:47,964
And I want you to carve your
dreams out of wood, real wood.

290
00:21:48,132 --> 00:21:49,313
Oak.

291
00:21:51,304 --> 00:21:53,159
And then I want you to...

292
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,680
...deepen in what you lack.

293
00:21:56,715 --> 00:21:58,691
So they never change.

294
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:00,658
Never change.

295
00:22:05,622 --> 00:22:08,124
What did the agency
send you for the show?

296
00:22:08,125 --> 00:22:09,763
I told them to send you a gift.

297
00:22:09,764 --> 00:22:11,403
Cheese in sausage platter.

298
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:13,046
Cheese in sausage?

299
00:22:14,467 --> 00:22:15,886
I wanna take this.

300
00:22:15,887 --> 00:22:19,099
I have an early morning meeting.

301
00:22:23,558 --> 00:22:27,287
Best part of a strawberry.
Best part.

302
00:22:30,436 --> 00:22:32,012
Are you ready to do the show?

303
00:22:32,013 --> 00:22:37,047
No I'm not ready to do the show, because
I can't even lubricate my fuck damn throat.

304
00:22:39,055 --> 00:22:40,356
- You know what.
- I'm gonna call...

305
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:45,793
I'm gonna call Gogie Water and
I'm gonna get mad at myself.

306
00:22:45,794 --> 00:22:48,279
I'll get my phone number.
I wish I had my cell.

307
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,669
No, you know what, Karl. Forget it.

308
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:53,521
Right. You just have my
fucking understudy do it.

309
00:22:58,299 --> 00:23:00,651
You're up for a show?

310
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:05,886
Get out there and knock them dead, alright?

311
00:23:15,681 --> 00:23:21,350
This is so gay. I just promised myself that I'm...

312
00:23:21,351 --> 00:23:26,469
..totally should stop the show for a second...
But I just promised myself that I would...

313
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:29,334
...dedicate this performance to my nana.

314
00:23:29,335 --> 00:23:36,360
Who although this mean I'll be your cup of tea specifically.
But she was very supportive of me.

315
00:23:36,361 --> 00:23:39,339
And we were very close.

316
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:42,084
And she passed away a year ago.

317
00:23:43,169 --> 00:23:44,879
This is for you nana.

318
00:23:49,381 --> 00:23:51,409
I'm sorry.

319
00:24:00,296 --> 00:24:05,880
She was ninety-six so obviously
I suspect fowl play.

320
00:24:10,289 --> 00:24:16,787
I am spending my own money and
I'm getting her body exhumed.

321
00:24:18,701 --> 00:24:23,978
And I am going to get a
full rape exam performed.

322
00:24:27,051 --> 00:24:30,419
And I'm gonna get to the bottom of this.

323
00:24:34,727 --> 00:24:38,151
And my parents are not behind me.

324
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:42,762
What else is new?

325
00:24:45,694 --> 00:24:47,108
They never are.

326
00:24:47,109 --> 00:24:50,141
They don't believe in me.

327
00:24:51,405 --> 00:24:53,600
So they're wrong this time.

328
00:24:53,757 --> 00:24:56,586
That sucks for them.

329
00:25:08,345 --> 00:25:13,121
Oh God please let them find semen in
my dead grandmother's vagina.

330
00:25:22,656 --> 00:25:30,394
My shit and I'm sorry
and that belongs offstage.

331
00:25:36,013 --> 00:25:39,720
"Can you blow your old nose,
can you tie your own shoe?"

332
00:25:39,721 --> 00:25:43,771
"If you had go grey once would
you even know what to do?"

333
00:25:43,772 --> 00:25:47,682
"When you make the duty is it in your pants?"

334
00:25:47,683 --> 00:25:51,146
"Or trousers as they suddenly damp?"

335
00:25:51,181 --> 00:25:54,904
"Are you mad because your grandson is gay?"

336
00:25:54,905 --> 00:25:58,963
"Is it a bummer that your pubes are all grey?"

337
00:25:58,964 --> 00:26:02,998
"When you clear your throat
is it really disgusting?"

338
00:26:02,999 --> 00:26:06,807
"Does it go on for hours and miles?"

339
00:26:06,808 --> 00:26:10,953
"You're gonna die soon,
you're gonna die soon."

340
00:26:10,954 --> 00:26:14,514
"It's not cold in here you're just dying."

341
00:26:14,515 --> 00:26:18,690
"You're gonna die soon,
you're gonna die soon."

342
00:26:18,691 --> 00:26:22,615
"You in the back, you are dying soon."

343
00:26:22,616 --> 00:26:26,253
"You're gonna die soon,
you're gonna die soon."

344
00:26:26,254 --> 00:26:30,342
"We're all gonna die but
not as soon as you, guys."

345
00:26:30,343 --> 00:26:37,542
"You're gonna die, you're gonna die.
You're dying."

346
00:26:40,984 --> 00:26:42,442
"Do you think I'm lazy?"

347
00:26:42,443 --> 00:26:44,555
"That's hilarious."

348
00:26:44,556 --> 00:26:47,636
"You're seen around,
dye your hair and take drugs."

349
00:26:47,637 --> 00:26:50,627
"The more you shrink,
the bigger your mouth gets."

350
00:26:50,628 --> 00:26:54,041
"It drives me crazy how you chew your vomits."

351
00:26:54,042 --> 00:26:55,807
"You told me you hated my perve."

352
00:26:55,808 --> 00:26:57,360
"I've been within you."

353
00:26:57,361 --> 00:27:01,829
"Pick up your prescription.
I'm not your candyman. Bagabooms."

354
00:27:03,124 --> 00:27:08,062
"You're gonna die soon,
you're gonna die. You're dying."

355
00:27:09,657 --> 00:27:17,710
I'm just sensitive and my skin is peeper thin.

356
00:27:17,711 --> 00:27:21,863
And people don't realize that
cause I'm sassy and I'm brassy.

357
00:27:22,503 --> 00:27:25,675
But I am... I just...

358
00:27:26,967 --> 00:27:34,129
You know I see care commercials with these
little kids with the giant bellies and the flies.

359
00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:38,811
And these are one and two
year-old babies, you know.

360
00:27:38,812 --> 00:27:40,337
Nine months pregnant.

361
00:27:45,262 --> 00:27:47,831
It breaks my heart in two.

362
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:53,541
It breaks my heart in half.

363
00:27:53,881 --> 00:27:57,640
And I don't give money cause I don't
want them to spend it on drugs.

364
00:28:02,801 --> 00:28:04,135
I give.

365
00:28:04,136 --> 00:28:08,203
You know I give.

366
00:28:08,204 --> 00:28:18,671
You know, I mean I dispass summer sent
15 really fun sweaters to this village in Africa.

367
00:28:18,672 --> 00:28:21,792
In really fun colors.

368
00:28:21,793 --> 00:28:24,539
Expecting nothing by the way.

369
00:28:27,506 --> 00:28:33,754
They called their money together,
whatever they call it.

370
00:28:33,755 --> 00:28:40,907
And bought a stamp and sent
me a postcard, thanking me.

371
00:28:40,908 --> 00:28:43,161
And it's a, you know, "Thank you".

372
00:28:43,917 --> 00:28:49,397
That day we had enough sweaters for
every single member of the village to get one.

373
00:28:49,398 --> 00:28:52,454
And that they were delicious.

374
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:17,574
I am working on an open
letter and it goes like this

375
00:29:17,575 --> 00:29:25,148
'Guess what, Martin Luther King.
I had a fucking dream too.

376
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:38,671
I had a dream that I was in my living-room. It wasn't my
living room, but it was like play in my living room in the dream.

377
00:29:39,507 --> 00:29:46,469
And I walk through to the backyard and
there's a pool and as I'm diving in there's a shark...

378
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:52,475
...coming up from the water with braces.'

379
00:29:52,476 --> 00:29:55,851
So maybe you're no so fucking special.

380
00:30:00,887 --> 00:30:03,195
Martin Looser King.

381
00:30:05,299 --> 00:30:06,226
Yeah.

382
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:12,338
I wanna be the first comic ever
to shit on Martin Luther King.

383
00:30:13,332 --> 00:30:15,684
People only talk about the good things.

384
00:30:16,756 --> 00:30:20,374
They don't mention he was a litterbug.

385
00:30:23,737 --> 00:30:25,541
He would lock...

386
00:30:25,542 --> 00:30:31,210
He'd roll up all the windows and lock
them and fart in the car with the heat up.

387
00:30:33,038 --> 00:30:39,871
Well his family suffered
and he would laugh.

388
00:30:42,687 --> 00:30:45,042
I just think people
should know everything.

389
00:30:46,118 --> 00:30:48,291
Before they give someone a day.

390
00:30:53,461 --> 00:30:55,144
I'm a comic I've something to say.

391
00:30:55,972 --> 00:30:57,729
That's the difference.

392
00:31:00,973 --> 00:31:03,857
Learnmedy, that's what I call it.

393
00:31:11,049 --> 00:31:12,549
When I was  a...

394
00:31:13,242 --> 00:31:17,350
When I was little I saw my father's
penis by accident and I just...

395
00:31:17,351 --> 00:31:21,283
I wasn't scarred by now but I think it really
affected me just because I was so young.

396
00:31:21,284 --> 00:31:22,488
You know. And so drunk.

397
00:31:25,209 --> 00:31:26,715
I did...

398
00:31:26,716 --> 00:31:27,725
This is fucked up.

399
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:34,060
When I was in high school I went out with my
father's best friend and that's embarrassing, you know.

400
00:31:34,061 --> 00:31:38,776
My father having a fourteen
year old best friend.

401
00:31:43,816 --> 00:31:49,578
It's like the way you treat your kids. You know the
way you raise them it forms everything they become.

402
00:31:49,579 --> 00:31:52,831
All the hang-ups or
whatever they had.

403
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:58,069
I went to get some water, I went to liquor
store down the street to get some water.

404
00:31:58,070 --> 00:32:01,460
Some delicious Fidgy water actually.

405
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:03,981
Which for some reason just tastes better.

406
00:32:06,501 --> 00:32:11,034
And as I'm walking in. There's a
man standing outside of the door.

407
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:17,922
Leutering outside the door. And as
I walk by he goes 'I want pussy'.

408
00:32:20,923 --> 00:32:27,113
First of all I'm not considered or
anything I just... But he, you know...

409
00:32:28,248 --> 00:32:30,486
He was talking to me.

410
00:32:33,775 --> 00:32:37,208
He definitely was talking to me
and he was like 'I want pussy'.

411
00:32:37,209 --> 00:32:40,270
I think it was more like 'I want pussy'.

412
00:32:40,271 --> 00:32:42,754
I can't do these accents.

413
00:32:45,421 --> 00:32:53,492
The point is I had every reason to be offended, to be
angry, you know, or whatever, but I felt sorry for him.

414
00:32:54,858 --> 00:32:58,812
It made me sad, because
he was so obvious to me.

415
00:32:58,813 --> 00:33:08,281
That this is the person who grew up, who was a child you know,
whose mother and father probably never gave him any pussy.

416
00:33:11,333 --> 00:33:17,179
You got to think before you judge people.
There's the point. Because it's a cycle.

417
00:33:19,726 --> 00:33:22,580
I have a joke to that part but. Anyway.

418
00:33:22,581 --> 00:33:25,864
The point I'm trying to say is
that kids need role models.

419
00:33:25,865 --> 00:33:33,706
They need adults in their lives that they can mold their own lives after.
Otherwise they gonna grow up and they're gonna be fucked up.

420
00:33:33,707 --> 00:33:35,805
Look at strippers.

421
00:33:35,806 --> 00:33:42,296
Right? Strippers should be
role models for little girls.

422
00:33:43,348 --> 00:33:47,171
If only for the fact that
they wax their assholes.

423
00:33:49,508 --> 00:33:51,523
I don't have the guts.

424
00:33:51,524 --> 00:33:54,705
And I don't think a lot of you do either.

425
00:33:54,706 --> 00:33:56,907
You excluded, sir.

426
00:34:00,453 --> 00:34:03,617
They deserve the purple heart
for that, the purple asshole.

427
00:34:04,999 --> 00:34:14,199
I have never... I mean the closest I've ever come to
waxing my asshole is once I got it washed and styled.

428
00:34:18,414 --> 00:34:24,299
They say, you know, strippers,
they end up being in porn.

429
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:28,060
It's like a gateway job to porn.

430
00:34:29,786 --> 00:34:31,039
I don't know.
What you gonna do?

431
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:35,882
I'd never do it.  And I could if
I wanted to up in approached.

432
00:34:37,985 --> 00:34:42,016
Or if I did it would be purely,
you know, for political reasons...

433
00:34:42,142 --> 00:34:48,698
...because I do not think there are enough
Jewish women represented in porn.

434
00:34:48,699 --> 00:34:50,692
Fuck my tokus!

435
00:34:54,657 --> 00:34:56,407
I'm a bad Jew.

436
00:34:58,444 --> 00:34:59,760
I'm a dirty Jew.

437
00:35:00,809 --> 00:35:04,153
Fucking dirty Jew.
Fuck my fucking tokus.

438
00:35:07,398 --> 00:35:08,961
We have fun.

439
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:13,031
Can I steal you?

440
00:35:16,059 --> 00:35:20,073
People think Jewish women aren't sexy.
That's such a bullshit, you know.

441
00:35:20,074 --> 00:35:22,280
Put on a sexy neglige.

442
00:35:35,245 --> 00:35:41,403
I have a long neck, that's probably one of my best
features. Out of many good features. But it's...

443
00:35:41,404 --> 00:35:45,786
I've a very swan-like neck.

444
00:35:45,787 --> 00:35:50,346
And my neck is actually six inches long,
completely flaccid.

445
00:35:52,521 --> 00:35:56,612
I am cheating. I'm measuring
from the base of my balls.

446
00:36:03,786 --> 00:36:17,601
I was watching a porn and it was like series of vignettes and this one
scene featured Ron Jeremy, very famous pornographic lesbian.

447
00:36:17,602 --> 00:36:22,355
And he, in the scene he's
masturbating on to a lady.

448
00:36:24,793 --> 00:36:28,587
But I noticed that his pinky was out.

449
00:36:28,588 --> 00:36:40,263
And found out why he does that. I found out why he
masturbates with his pinky out. It's because he's classy.

450
00:36:45,468 --> 00:36:46,891
I'd like to sing a song.

451
00:36:47,828 --> 00:36:50,040
If I may. With your permission.

452
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:56,651
This is a song dedicated to all the porn
actors and porn actresses out there..

453
00:36:56,652 --> 00:37:02,068
I know that my guitar is Steve.
Did porn for a wile, gay porn.

454
00:37:04,209 --> 00:37:10,210
Ladies it was work, it was a job.
Trust me, but...

455
00:37:10,211 --> 00:37:11,810
I was in gafro.

456
00:37:13,543 --> 00:37:15,320
You got gafroed all over your face.

457
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:19,500
But seriously, let's take it down a second.

458
00:37:19,501 --> 00:37:22,638
Jennifer, can we take it down,
get some mood light in here?

459
00:37:22,639 --> 00:37:24,980
Wow, sexy. Sexy lighting.

460
00:37:25,637 --> 00:37:29,797
This is a song... Is there anything on me at all?

461
00:37:32,363 --> 00:37:41,979
"You give yourself to all lovers."

462
00:37:44,464 --> 00:37:51,389
"Sharing all your liquidness."

463
00:37:52,184 --> 00:37:59,827
"Temporary happiness."

464
00:37:59,828 --> 00:38:03,195
"It's you."

465
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:10,448
"There's a hole in your butt.
Where the duty comes out."

466
00:38:10,449 --> 00:38:14,258
"There's a hole in your butt
where the penis goes in."

467
00:38:14,259 --> 00:38:21,016
"Your vagina had so many penises in, that you might
as well talk about the times they were not in it."

468
00:38:21,017 --> 00:38:26,234
"Just roll on the times
that are more unique."

469
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:33,959
"Do you ever take drugs so that
you can have sex without crying?"

470
00:38:35,262 --> 00:38:40,917
"Do you ever take drugs so that
you can have sex without crying?"

471
00:38:42,585 --> 00:38:49,654
"There's a dream in your head that will never come true.
There's a sticking this all over and it didn't come from you."

472
00:38:49,655 --> 00:38:56,729
"You wish your dad had been there but more often times he was not.
You can't put your arms around the dirty gang-bang cumshot."

473
00:38:56,730 --> 00:38:58,433
"But that's all you get."

474
00:38:58,957 --> 00:39:01,019
"That's all you get."

475
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:08,817
"Do you ever take drugs so that
you can have sex without crying?"

476
00:39:10,175 --> 00:39:15,964
"Do you ever take drugs so that
you can have sex without crying?"

477
00:39:17,691 --> 00:39:27,365
"There's a hole in your heart where the sorrow poures out.
There's a hole in your heart where ambivalence sets in."

478
00:39:30,487 --> 00:39:36,541
"All the penises in the country."

479
00:39:38,671 --> 00:39:46,426
"All the penises in the world."

480
00:39:48,656 --> 00:39:55,800
"All the penises in the galaxy."

481
00:40:00,009 --> 00:40:07,992
"Want your hard hole"

482
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:27,646
Thank you.

483
00:40:28,890 --> 00:40:30,976
Thank you for this Silverman.

484
00:40:40,586 --> 00:40:45,742
You know who has a tiny vagina?

485
00:40:46,943 --> 00:40:48,904
Barbie.

486
00:40:51,203 --> 00:40:52,770
Not Klaus Barbie.

487
00:40:52,771 --> 00:40:55,193
The anthem is Nazi.

488
00:40:55,194 --> 00:40:56,402
Okay.

489
00:40:57,087 --> 00:40:59,857
Nazis are assholoes.
And I'll be the first one to say it.

490
00:40:59,858 --> 00:41:01,151
Some edgy.

491
00:41:04,235 --> 00:41:09,519
Nazis are motherfucking
asshole wipes, dicks.

492
00:41:11,967 --> 00:41:15,136
They cute when they’re little. I will get that.

493
00:41:15,137 --> 00:41:18,063
You're so cute. Why can they be so small?

494
00:41:23,312 --> 00:41:26,360
I always know when its Hitler's birthday.

495
00:41:26,361 --> 00:41:30,771
Cause they announced it on Entertainment Tonight.

496
00:41:30,772 --> 00:41:33,788
Right before they got a commercial,
you see like a silhouette.

497
00:41:33,789 --> 00:41:40,278
And then they say, you know,"This man is
responsible for the deaths of six million Jews."

498
00:41:40,279 --> 00:41:43,358
Is it Ted Danson?

499
00:41:47,284 --> 00:41:49,501
Patrick Doughy?

500
00:41:50,731 --> 00:41:58,970
My niece is... my lesbian niece, they all families for
a Julian. She goes to hebrew school and loves it.

501
00:41:58,971 --> 00:42:06,005
And she called me up and she's like, you know
"Aunt Sarah, did you know that Hitler killed sixty million Jews?"

502
00:42:06,006 --> 00:42:14,113
And I corrected her and said you know,
I think he is responsible for killing six million Jews.

503
00:42:14,114 --> 00:42:20,015
And she said "Oh yes, six million, I knew that
but seriously, I mean what's the difference?"

504
00:42:23,117 --> 00:42:28,807
The difference is sixty million
is unforgivable, young lady.

505
00:42:30,737 --> 00:42:32,732
Kids, you know.

506
00:42:32,733 --> 00:42:35,788
Try to figure them out.
I can't. Who could?

507
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:47,022
My nana was a survivor of the Holocaust.
I'm sorry, alleged Holocaust.

508
00:42:47,023 --> 00:42:54,958
And he had the tattoo, you know, the number and thank
God she was at one of the better concentration camps.

509
00:42:54,959 --> 00:42:59,317
She had a vanity number,
it's said a... "Bedazzled."

510
00:42:59,318 --> 00:43:01,097
Just kind of fun.

511
00:43:02,249 --> 00:43:06,602
You know I don't understand the...

512
00:43:06,603 --> 00:43:10,698
... Jewish people who
drive German cars.

513
00:43:10,699 --> 00:43:12,690
It's so...

514
00:43:12,691 --> 00:43:19,622
It's not a secret. that companies like Mercedes and
BMW and you know, Hitler commissioned Volkswagen.

515
00:43:19,623 --> 00:43:23,433
These are companies that
built cars for the Nazi war affair.

516
00:43:24,078 --> 00:43:31,127
Jewish people who drive German cars it's so gay.

517
00:43:32,543 --> 00:43:33,280
It's just gay.

518
00:43:33,281 --> 00:43:38,441
And on the other side of the thing there's companies,
you know, there's Mercedes, companies like that who...

519
00:43:38,442 --> 00:43:44,126
Boy, you know, if they could have only had the foresight,
if they only could have seen into the future.

520
00:43:44,628 --> 00:43:50,722
The kind of business, you know, the amount of
money they'd be making from Jewish consumers.

521
00:43:51,763 --> 00:43:56,822
I don't know, maybe they'd help not
killed the Jews. But, you know...

522
00:43:56,823 --> 00:44:07,228
Instead they helped, facilitated genocide of a people
who would ultimately become their best customers.

523
00:44:09,646 --> 00:44:13,870
Any Jew will tell you it's just
bad business, you know.

524
00:44:15,810 --> 00:44:20,703
And now I feel preachy. But I just ...
I really believe this to be true.

525
00:44:20,704 --> 00:44:32,556
I believe that if black people were in Germany during World War 2,
that the Holocaust would have never happened. I do, you know.

526
00:44:32,557 --> 00:44:35,671
Or not to Jews.

527
00:44:40,601 --> 00:44:45,896
I got in trouble for saying the word 'chink' on
a talk show. On the network talk show.

528
00:44:45,897 --> 00:44:50,807
It was in the context of a joke, you know.
Obviously that would be weird.

529
00:44:50,808 --> 00:44:52,756
I'd be like a really bad career choice.

530
00:44:54,172 --> 00:45:02,080
But nevertheless the president of an Asian-American watched
our group out here in Los Angeles. His name is Guy Ayoki.

531
00:45:02,081 --> 00:45:07,943
And he was up in arms about it. And he put
my name in all the papers, calling me a racist.

532
00:45:07,944 --> 00:45:15,206
And it hurts. I mean as a Jew, as a
member of the Jewish community...

533
00:45:15,207 --> 00:45:20,153
...I was really concerned that
we're loosing control of the media.

534
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:34,176
I'm right. I mean like what kind of world do we live in, where
a totally cute white girl can't say chink on network television?

535
00:45:36,989 --> 00:45:39,023
It's like the 50's.

536
00:45:39,024 --> 00:45:40,169
It's scary.

537
00:45:41,901 --> 00:45:47,579
There are only two Asian people that I
know that I have any problem with, at all.

538
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:57,494
One is Guy Ayoki, the other is my friend
Steve who actually went pee-pee in my coke.

539
00:45:58,617 --> 00:46:02,654
He's all 'Me Chinese, me play joke'

540
00:46:05,742 --> 00:46:10,214
If you have to explain it,
Steve, it's not funny.

541
00:46:12,290 --> 00:46:14,017
It's not funny.

542
00:46:14,018 --> 00:46:16,104
We have to break it down.

543
00:46:20,198 --> 00:46:23,736
You have to be able
to laugh at yourself. So...

544
00:46:23,737 --> 00:46:26,491
It's what I tell Asian people all the time.

545
00:46:27,814 --> 00:46:29,617
They don't listen.

546
00:46:32,310 --> 00:46:40,609
Midgets. You know the politically correct
word for 'midget' is 'little person'.

547
00:46:40,610 --> 00:46:49,213
Which just tickles me because it's like the only politically correct
word that actually more insulting than the original one.

548
00:46:49,214 --> 00:46:53,750
Midgets don't like being called 'little people'.

549
00:46:53,751 --> 00:46:57,969
They much prefer 'Yes you are!'

550
00:47:07,638 --> 00:47:10,727
Thank you for laughing at that.
I appreciate it.

551
00:47:10,728 --> 00:47:15,871
I always feel crappy when I do that joke.
It gets such a good laugh.

552
00:47:16,972 --> 00:47:24,010
I just feel like. What did midgets ever do?
You know as a people to deserve to be marked.

553
00:47:24,012 --> 00:47:28,692
They’re human beings born extra crazy small.

554
00:47:33,361 --> 00:47:37,665
I don't think like anybody here thinks
we should make fun of midgets.

555
00:47:39,096 --> 00:47:41,101
But we do anyway.

556
00:47:42,062 --> 00:47:46,616
I think it's because...

557
00:47:46,829 --> 00:47:49,083
I'll tell you why we make fun of midgets.

558
00:47:49,084 --> 00:47:50,797
We're not afraid of them.

559
00:47:50,798 --> 00:47:54,336
That's what it always boils down to,
cross the board.

560
00:47:55,459 --> 00:48:01,394
I mean, I had a joke with the word
'nigger' in it, that I thought was so edgy.

561
00:48:01,395 --> 00:48:02,914
And so hip.

562
00:48:02,915 --> 00:48:07,489
I was doing it all over town at comedy
clubs and I was at one this one club...

563
00:48:07,490 --> 00:48:14,671
...doing my show and I look in a front
row and a whole front table is black people.

564
00:48:14,672 --> 00:48:18,798
Or African American people.

565
00:48:18,799 --> 00:48:22,219
And you know what?
He was half and half.

566
00:48:22,220 --> 00:48:23,528
I'm pretty sure.

567
00:48:26,401 --> 00:48:31,607
But the point is I didn't do the joke.

568
00:48:31,608 --> 00:48:37,018
And you get ask yourself, is that an
edgy joke or is that the racist joke?

569
00:48:37,019 --> 00:48:40,131
I didn't do it cause I was afraid of them.

570
00:48:42,953 --> 00:48:44,101
I didn't.

571
00:48:44,102 --> 00:48:48,750
And I ended up changing that joke to chinks.

572
00:48:51,603 --> 00:48:55,261
So you live and you learn
and hopefully you grow.

573
00:48:58,346 --> 00:49:06,845
I was going... I was about to go on a talk show and talk about that whole
kind of idea how we make fun of people that we're not afraid of.

574
00:49:06,846 --> 00:49:11,639
But we refrain from making fun
of people we... that scare us.

575
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:16,082
And I was about  to go on and a segment
producer came over to me and he said.

576
00:49:16,083 --> 00:49:19,912
You know, instead of
niggers say the N word.

577
00:49:19,913 --> 00:49:24,807
And I said, great, what do you want me to
say for chink? And he said 'Say chink.'

578
00:49:24,808 --> 00:49:26,595
Why?

579
00:49:28,872 --> 00:49:32,118
I'd like to sing a song for you now.

580
00:49:45,706 --> 00:49:47,005
It's twisted.

581
00:49:54,252 --> 00:49:55,752
A love song.

582
00:49:56,454 --> 00:49:59,374
Oh shit.

583
00:50:02,870 --> 00:50:07,837
I did that on rehearsal too, I forgot and the guy,
one of the guys working in a back said 'Plug it in'.

584
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:11,339
And I said "Yeah, we will fucking rip it up".

585
00:50:12,207 --> 00:50:14,032
Plug it in.

586
00:50:17,675 --> 00:50:19,558
One, two, three, four.

587
00:50:19,559 --> 00:50:22,798
"I love you more than bears love honey."

588
00:50:22,799 --> 00:50:26,172
"I love you more than Jews love money."

589
00:50:26,173 --> 00:50:30,956
"I love you more than Asians are good at math."

590
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:36,096
"I love you even if it's not hip."

591
00:50:36,097 --> 00:50:39,252
"I love you more than black people don't tip."

592
00:50:39,253 --> 00:50:43,795
"I love you more than Puerto Ricans need baths."

593
00:50:46,036 --> 00:50:49,192
"I love you more than girls love dolls."

594
00:50:49,193 --> 00:50:52,343
"I love you more than dogs love balls."

595
00:50:52,344 --> 00:50:56,634
"I love you more than the white stuff in us it."

596
00:50:58,817 --> 00:51:02,137
"I love you like Gary Busey."

597
00:51:02,138 --> 00:51:05,519
"I love you more than Dikes love pussy."

598
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:09,960
"I love you more than my
after show monster bone heap."

599
00:51:21,155 --> 00:51:28,597
"Jewish people driving German cars."

600
00:51:28,598 --> 00:51:32,511
"Jewie people buying German cars."

601
00:51:32,512 --> 00:51:34,946
"What the cock is that shit?"

602
00:51:35,588 --> 00:51:39,283
"But maybe it's like take back for night."

603
00:51:39,284 --> 00:51:42,830
"Maybe it's like a bleeding hearts
grow old and swing to the right."

604
00:51:42,831 --> 00:51:47,434
"Maybe it's like when a faggot
calls himself a faggot."

605
00:51:47,435 --> 00:51:52,659
"Jewish people driving German cars."

606
00:51:52,660 --> 00:51:55,674
"It's the opposite of foo-boo."

607
00:51:56,105 --> 00:52:03,634
"But maybe it's Patty Herst siding with her kidnappers, maybe it's
like African miner killing diamond-bering gangster robbers."

608
00:52:03,635 --> 00:52:09,296
"Maybe it's like when blackeyes
calls each other niggers."

609
00:52:52,139 --> 00:52:53,588
"Cha-cha-cha."

610
00:53:05,384 --> 00:53:14,801
My friend Ryan Lynch came for me tonight. We got drunk and...
he got drunk I don't drink, but I think I... something happened.

611
00:53:18,367 --> 00:53:25,362
I dared him to deep his balls into
his drink for a dollar, for a second.

612
00:53:25,363 --> 00:53:28,829
And would not do it.

613
00:53:28,830 --> 00:53:33,927
I just thought it'd be funny if he like,
I don't know, play... like pleate them in.

614
00:53:36,613 --> 00:53:42,083
He wouldn't do it. I just think it's interesting,
like I know exactly why he wouldn't do it.

615
00:53:42,306 --> 00:53:51,189
And this is interesting. He wouldn't do it because
he knew if he put them in his drink and they floated...

616
00:53:51,518 --> 00:53:55,041
...we would know that his balls are bewitched.

617
00:53:55,076 --> 00:53:59,166
And I just... love that, you know.

618
00:54:00,386 --> 00:54:04,054
I love like getting into the psychology of people.

619
00:54:07,509 --> 00:54:12,158
I did not lose my virginity until was 26.

620
00:54:12,159 --> 00:54:14,159
And that's true.

621
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:16,300
19 vaginally.

622
00:54:19,896 --> 00:54:24,202
But 26, you know, what my
boyfriend calls the 'real way'.

623
00:54:29,697 --> 00:54:33,479
You know what, that's a fucking
disgusting joke. And I don't do that.

624
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:35,115
That's a fictional.

625
00:54:35,116 --> 00:54:39,484
That's a joke, I mean I don't...
That's fucking nasty. And I don't...

626
00:54:39,485 --> 00:54:43,990
My asshole is...
It's totally for decoration.

627
00:54:43,991 --> 00:54:46,320
It's like an appendix.

628
00:54:46,321 --> 00:54:48,638
I tell people that I was shocked.

629
00:54:49,863 --> 00:54:51,166
I am...

630
00:54:53,354 --> 00:55:02,206
And my friend Mike was... he was like on last night
'Oh, you know, it's not disgusting, it's natural.'

631
00:55:02,207 --> 00:55:05,163
It's like trying to sell me on it being natural.

632
00:55:05,897 --> 00:55:09,632
First of all duty comes out of there, okay.

633
00:55:09,633 --> 00:55:13,227
And second of all fucking
duty comes out of here.

634
00:55:13,228 --> 00:55:18,116
I don't need two reasons
when duties involved.

635
00:55:18,117 --> 00:55:24,152
I'm like going off and then remember
as I'm talking that Mike is gay.

636
00:55:24,153 --> 00:55:31,967
And I now have to backpedal and say like 'no,
your asshole is like your vagina. That's totally cool'.

637
00:55:34,825 --> 00:55:36,873
I think on my figs, I'm a comedian.

638
00:55:39,674 --> 00:55:46,705
And he took me to the gay march this year and it was blast,
I haven't been there before. And it's so fun and it's just crazy.

639
00:55:47,593 --> 00:55:54,045
I just don't want... like I don't wanna
be labeled as straight or labbled as gay.

640
00:55:54,046 --> 00:56:00,586
I just want people to look at me and see me.
You know that's white.

641
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:07,147
I can say that, by the way, cause I used
to go out with a guy who was half black.

642
00:56:07,148 --> 00:56:10,532
Who totally broke up with me.
Cause I'm a fucking loser.

643
00:56:14,772 --> 00:56:17,203
I just heard myself say that.

644
00:56:17,204 --> 00:56:18,584
I'm such a pessimist.

645
00:56:18,585 --> 00:56:25,709
It was a worst attitude. He's a half-white.
And he totally broke up with me.

646
00:56:25,710 --> 00:56:36,022
And it's funny now, like what is it? King size 20-20 or whatever.
Like I know it so obvious to me now why he broke up with me.

647
00:56:36,023 --> 00:56:38,995
Cause he has so fucking low self esteem.

648
00:56:38,996 --> 00:56:46,556
And I can't compete with that, like everybody knows somebody
who... it's like anything you say to them they gonna take it.

649
00:56:46,557 --> 00:56:49,236
They gonna hear it in the most negative way.

650
00:56:49,237 --> 00:56:50,366
You know what I mean.

651
00:56:50,367 --> 00:56:51,881
And he was like. You could give him...

652
00:56:51,882 --> 00:56:59,977
Like I gave him a compliment, alright. I told him he probably
would have made like a really expensive slave.

653
00:57:03,296 --> 00:57:05,623
Like in the olden time days.

654
00:57:05,624 --> 00:57:07,308
Not now.

655
00:57:08,879 --> 00:57:19,682
What does he do? Right. It goes through the roobe gold
berg, you know craziest straw of his low self esteem.

656
00:57:19,683 --> 00:57:24,039
And it hit his ear and he
heard something. Fucked up.

657
00:57:27,672 --> 00:57:31,626
I can't control that.
Like I can't control what he hears.

658
00:57:32,529 --> 00:57:35,441
He has to learn how to love himself.

659
00:57:35,442 --> 00:57:39,563
Before I can stop hating his people.

660
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:42,235
As a people.

661
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:48,928
I don't care if you think I'm racist.
I just want you to think I'm thin.

662
00:57:59,308 --> 00:58:01,748
I do talk a little bit about race.

663
00:58:01,749 --> 00:58:12,719
The important thing it’s like the...
Like if I based my material on stereotypes.

664
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:21,254
That would be messed up. It would.
But I don't. Okay. I base it on facts.

665
00:58:23,271 --> 00:58:30,620
Fact the SAT test, the test that basically
decides whether you go to college or not.

666
00:58:30,621 --> 00:58:39,888
Is called truly byest towards Caucasians.
That's a fact. Okay, I heard that somewhere.

667
00:58:39,889 --> 00:58:41,311
Fact...

668
00:58:41,312 --> 00:58:50,043
It the year 2004 women still get paid 70 cents
to every dollar a men gets paid. And that's a fact.

669
00:58:51,188 --> 00:59:01,342
Okay. Fact, every 30 seconds in this country a person of color jumps
up and down and waves their arms behind a local news reporter.

670
00:59:09,712 --> 00:59:10,905
Fact.

671
00:59:16,476 --> 00:59:23,051
I went out with the Mexican man. Do racist people
go out with Mexican men? I don't think so.

672
00:59:25,829 --> 00:59:28,042
No, they're filthy.

673
00:59:34,247 --> 00:59:43,357
It's so hard like...  I feel about like it's jokes. You know like
this woman came up to me last night a she was Mexican and...

674
00:59:43,358 --> 00:59:53,196
...she was so irate, you know she was so angry. And ahe came
up to me ad she said 'You know I'm Mexican and I don't stink'

675
00:59:53,629 --> 01:00:01,721
And it's just broke my heart. Like I had to
explain to her like you can't smell yourself.

676
01:00:01,722 --> 01:00:03,785
Thanks a lot.

677
01:00:30,668 --> 01:00:36,669
Thank you so much. And we would
love to, and I mean the royal We,

678
01:00:36,670 --> 01:00:43,666
leave you with a song.
Something inspirational to live with.

679
01:00:43,667 --> 01:00:45,023
Amazing grace.

680
01:00:49,289 --> 01:00:56,853
"Amazing grace how sweet it sounds.
That save the rash like me."

681
01:00:56,854 --> 01:01:05,093
"I once was lost but now I'm found.
Was blind but now I see."

682
01:01:05,094 --> 01:01:12,817
"It was grace that taught my heart to fear.
And grace my fears relieved."

683
01:01:12,818 --> 01:01:20,732
"A precious day that grace appeared
the hour I first believed."

684
01:01:20,733 --> 01:01:28,821
"Amazing grace, how sweet it sounds,
that save the rash like me."

685
01:01:28,822 --> 01:01:35,484
"I once was lost but now
I'm found, was blind by now I..."

686
01:01:35,485 --> 01:01:37,412
"Was blind by now I'm..."

687
01:01:37,413 --> 01:01:44,911
"Blind by now I see."

688
01:01:53,855 --> 01:02:08,175
"I say no good people turn their hips each
day so satisfied I'm on my way."

689
01:02:08,176 --> 01:02:09,217
Good night!

690
01:02:45,428 --> 01:02:46,839
Come in.

691
01:02:47,721 --> 01:02:48,952
Hi.

692
01:02:48,953 --> 01:02:52,223
- Oh my God, you were so great.
- Thank you.

693
01:02:52,224 --> 01:02:53,541
It was awesome.

694
01:02:53,542 --> 01:02:55,116
It was amazing.

695
01:02:55,117 --> 01:02:57,655
It's like all new material.

696
01:02:57,656 --> 01:03:01,829
And rape, and AIDS and
Holocaust, just like you said.

697
01:03:01,830 --> 01:03:04,027
I was so cool.

698
01:03:04,028 --> 01:03:05,987
You must be so proud of yourself.

699
01:03:05,988 --> 01:03:07,329
- It is so great.
- I am.

700
01:03:07,330 --> 01:03:10,228
Wow, look at this, it's so pretty.

701
01:03:10,229 --> 01:03:11,637
It's beautiful.

702
01:03:11,638 --> 01:03:13,021
Oh my God what a spread.

703
01:03:13,022 --> 01:03:14,752
Do you guys want something?

704
01:03:14,753 --> 01:03:16,705
- I'm so hungry actually. I'm starving.
- Yeah I'm dying.

705
01:03:16,706 --> 01:03:18,141
This is like my dinner.

706
01:03:19,404 --> 01:03:22,583
I've got some Wochie water, delicious.

707
01:03:22,584 --> 01:03:23,851
If you want.

708
01:03:23,852 --> 01:03:26,356
Actually it's just the last one,
so just you can split it.

709
01:03:26,357 --> 01:03:28,377
When do you drink a whole water?

710
01:03:29,457 --> 01:03:31,173
I always leave it.

711
01:03:31,174 --> 01:03:33,020
- Do you want some?
- No I'm good.

712
01:03:33,021 --> 01:03:34,083
I can open.

713
01:03:35,081 --> 01:03:36,244
This one is open.

714
01:03:36,245 --> 01:03:38,231
Thanks for coming by.

715
01:03:38,232 --> 01:03:42,438
And I'm sorry I just think I want...

716
01:03:42,439 --> 01:03:44,782
... like me alone.

717
01:03:44,783 --> 01:03:47,233
Oh yeah, of course.

718
01:03:50,544 --> 01:03:53,442
- We all just, you know, we'll call you.
- Like now.

719
01:03:55,959 --> 01:03:57,179
Okay.

720
01:03:57,180 --> 01:03:57,836
It's okay.

721
01:03:57,837 --> 01:04:02,283
- We'll go get a drink.
- Great job.

722
01:04:04,409 --> 01:04:07,013
We gonna get a drink and...

723
01:04:07,014 --> 01:04:08,808
Have a good time.

724
01:04:13,182 --> 01:04:14,961
It was awesome.

725
01:04:15,964 --> 01:04:17,796
I know!

726
01:04:18,137 --> 01:04:19,320
Bye Sarah.

727
01:04:19,321 --> 01:04:20,242
Bye-bye.

728
01:04:21,642 --> 01:04:23,543
Thank you.

729
01:04:56,483 --> 01:04:57,667
You did it, kid.

730
01:05:02,328 --> 01:05:05,085
Come over here,
I got a secret for you.

731
01:05:09,288 --> 01:05:11,634
You're fucking amazing.

732
01:05:24,384 --> 01:05:25,761
You are a star.

733
01:05:28,034 --> 01:05:30,603
And I'm a star fucker.

734
01:05:58,405 --> 01:06:05,016
I didn't get any sleep. I went to sleep at 1 in the morning.
I woke up at 3 in the morning. Because I was just excited.

735
01:06:05,171 --> 01:06:08,026
I made myself stay in bed,
but it was like this in bed.

736
01:06:09,602 --> 01:06:10,551
What are you gonna do?

737
01:06:10,552 --> 01:06:12,303
Maybe I'll take a nap. You know.

738
01:06:14,921 --> 01:06:16,912
When I'm dead. Alright?

739
01:06:17,621 --> 01:06:18,759
Fuck yeah!

740
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:20,855
What is that noise,

741
01:06:21,363 --> 01:06:23,041
It's a child laughing.

742
01:06:23,195 --> 01:06:33,840
It's really hard, guys. Seriously don't go into acting,
cause it's totally like harder work than you think.

743
01:06:33,841 --> 01:06:38,432
You know what? It just like.. I just...
It helps me realize I'm alive.

744
01:06:38,433 --> 01:06:40,992
Going out with the guy
who drives German car.

745
01:06:40,993 --> 01:06:43,443
And I'm looking for a Yin to my Yang.

746
01:06:43,444 --> 01:06:49,948
Looking for a Yin to my Yang.
He hates women too and I love it.

747
01:06:49,949 --> 01:06:51,543
So fuck you.

748
01:06:51,544 --> 01:06:53,390
A bird shit on me.

749
01:06:53,391 --> 01:06:55,002
A day before yesterday.

750
01:06:56,908 --> 01:06:58,098
Do you feel lucky?

751
01:06:58,099 --> 01:07:00,859
I felt lucky.
Yeah. I was like...

752
01:07:06,831 --> 01:07:13,076
I imagine the birds, they lay eggs and they're like
'Oh my God, I can't believe it came out of my pussy'.

753
01:07:14,366 --> 01:07:18,568
My name is Laura Silverman
I'm actually Sarah's sister.

754
01:07:18,569 --> 01:07:20,205
In real life.

755
01:07:21,246 --> 01:07:25,192
And I'm playing her friend
which I'm not in real life.

756
01:07:25,193 --> 01:07:29,498
And I'm Brian Posehn, her friend.
And I'm actually playing her sister.

757
01:07:29,499 --> 01:07:30,537
Hey guys.

758
01:07:30,538 --> 01:07:33,657
-Hey. We're doing a little...
- Hi Sarah.

759
01:07:33,658 --> 01:07:35,179
Feature out.

760
01:07:35,180 --> 01:07:36,575
In the scene we sink in.

761
01:07:36,576 --> 01:07:37,304
- Cool.
- Yeah.

762
01:07:38,125 --> 01:07:38,697
No.

763
01:07:38,698 --> 01:07:40,546
We just doing joke...

764
01:07:43,409 --> 01:07:45,057
So how is it working with Sarah?

765
01:07:45,269 --> 01:07:47,512
It's horrib... great.

766
01:07:47,513 --> 01:07:53,980
It's if you really-really into Sarah it's great.
Because Jews into Sarah.

767
01:07:53,981 --> 01:07:54,588
Yeah.

768
01:07:54,589 --> 01:07:56,436
So we have a common interest.

769
01:08:00,116 --> 01:08:03,967
Three of the actors just died from that.

770
01:08:03,968 --> 01:08:08,688
I'm 1 year and 1 month pregnant I'm 13
months pregnant, I just found out.

771
01:08:08,689 --> 01:08:12,551
That's what Steve calls
his wife - the Cuntintsky.

772
01:08:12,552 --> 01:08:13,642
I'm not married.

773
01:08:13,643 --> 01:08:14,760
Whatever.

774
01:08:14,761 --> 01:08:15,901
Fuck you.

775
01:08:16,059 --> 01:08:17,045
Fucker.

776
01:08:17,090 --> 01:08:18,209
Alright you're good there.

777
01:08:18,450 --> 01:08:19,685
Motherfucker.

778
01:08:19,686 --> 01:08:20,626
Okay guys.

779
01:08:22,315 --> 01:08:24,140
I came in here to have gas.

780
01:08:24,141 --> 01:08:30,979
Like Marla Thomas that just walked in on her father
under a coffee table with girl take mission on it.

781
01:08:31,546 --> 01:08:33,234
What's f....

782
01:08:33,235 --> 01:08:34,249
What's funny?

783
01:08:34,250 --> 01:08:36,322
I would love to know what's funny?

784
01:08:36,323 --> 01:08:39,254
You guys better go.
Thanks a lot.

785
01:08:40,976 --> 01:08:43,167
Fuck. Fucking take it!

786
01:08:48,552 --> 01:08:53,771
The best time to get pregnant
is when you're a black teenager.

787
01:09:05,581 --> 01:09:08,231
Nazis are assholoes.

788
01:09:08,232 --> 01:09:14,784
But that's totally not true because
they're cute when they're little.
