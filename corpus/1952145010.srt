1
00:00:18,451 --> 00:00:19,145
He's lying.

2
00:00:19,886 --> 00:00:20,648
You think?

3
00:00:21,054 --> 00:00:23,284
Everything that comes out
of his mouth is a lie.

4
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:25,216
Well, what do you want to do?

5
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:27,390
What the fuck you mean
"what I want to do?"

6
00:00:28,395 --> 00:00:29,794
...Go cut off his fingers!

7
00:00:30,163 --> 00:00:32,597
Hang on,
I think I can make him talk.

8
00:00:32,999 --> 00:00:35,007
Who gives a shit?
I found the lighter.

9
00:00:35,235 --> 00:00:36,031
Well...

10
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:39,734
Fine you want to make him talk,
knock yourself out.

11
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:49,007
Eddie, Eddie, Eddie,

12
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:51,783
the only reason your not
being chopped up

13
00:00:51,918 --> 00:00:53,249
into little pieces right now is

14
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:57,447
because I convinced my man over there,
you'd tell the truth.

15
00:00:59,092 --> 00:01:03,426
So come on do me a solid,
huh... the truth will set you free.

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,092
You think I don't know that, man?

17
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:11,234
I've known that ever
since my Grandmother

18
00:01:11,371 --> 00:01:12,065
was whipping it out of me

19
00:01:12,205 --> 00:01:14,503
when I was growing up
on the south side.

20
00:01:15,341 --> 00:01:17,809
I been in this business long enough...

21
00:01:18,545 --> 00:01:22,948
I done seen enough mother fuckers
get there ass smoked to know

22
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:27,076
that at the end of the day
the truth is all that matters.

23
00:01:28,621 --> 00:01:30,248
Now I don't know
if you actually give a shit

24
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:33,359
about somebody making
some crank in some school bus,

25
00:01:34,461 --> 00:01:37,055
or if you're just trying to figure out
why everybody's dead.

26
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:40,392
All I can do is tell you
what happened.

27
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,483
Packed everything?
You took long enough.

28
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,551
Look, Eddie, I know you think

29
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:09,678
I am some sort of
back stabbing whore...

30
00:03:15,762 --> 00:03:16,694
you can trust me.

31
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:22,532
I gotta tell you something, Lexy,
I don't believe in a lot of shit...

32
00:03:23,903 --> 00:03:27,304
I believe in God,
I believe in strength...

33
00:03:35,014 --> 00:03:37,881
...I don't know why but I trust you.

34
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:40,450
I believe you.

35
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,418
I gotta tell you something ok...

36
00:03:47,093 --> 00:03:47,718
What?

37
00:03:50,663 --> 00:03:51,425
I lied.

38
00:03:58,137 --> 00:03:58,865
Stop.

39
00:03:59,472 --> 00:04:01,064
You know what we want to hear.

40
00:04:01,307 --> 00:04:04,299
Why you talking about some hooker
that gets her head blown off?

41
00:04:04,444 --> 00:04:05,775
Cut his fucking fingers off!

42
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:08,278
Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Hold the fuck up...

43
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:10,342
you know none of this shit
would have happened

44
00:04:10,483 --> 00:04:14,783
if Junior hadn't called us
in the first place, let me start over.

45
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:19,552
Hello?

46
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:21,087
Yo, guess who this is...

47
00:04:21,227 --> 00:04:22,558
You're on caller I.D. Junior.

48
00:04:22,695 --> 00:04:26,995
Ahhh, yo, I didn't think your ass
could read, Son!

49
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:29,631
Yo Check this out since
you're feeling so fucking smart today

50
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:32,636
Inspector fucking Gadget,
where the fuck is my dad?

51
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:33,634
I haven't seen him.

52
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:34,637
What you mean you
haven't seen him?

53
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:36,071
He was supposed to call me,
like an hour ago!

54
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,506
Oh, Oh! You know what?
Come to think of it...

55
00:04:39,145 --> 00:04:40,373
I still haven't seen him.

56
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:43,241
That's really funny,
for a fucking retard.

57
00:04:43,383 --> 00:04:44,350
Tell you what, find my dad

58
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:45,974
or I'm gonna make you
clean my bathroom.

59
00:04:47,987 --> 00:04:49,955
You know I changed
that punks diaper once.

60
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:50,919
What's he want man?

61
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:52,523
Supposed to meet
his dad an hour ago.

62
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:53,717
He didn't show.

63
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:58,954
Here you are sir.

64
00:05:01,768 --> 00:05:02,860
Is this chicken?

65
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:04,661
Yes, sir that's chicken parmesan.

66
00:05:04,904 --> 00:05:06,599
Why would you bring it
to my table?

67
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,034
Because that is
what you ordered sir.

68
00:05:10,176 --> 00:05:12,076
You're telling me
I don't know what I ordered.

69
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,074
Rocky...

70
00:05:15,114 --> 00:05:16,103
Be easy

71
00:05:16,516 --> 00:05:18,916
The whole ride over here,
Eddie, what did I talk about?

72
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:19,882
Veal Parmesan

73
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:20,849
Veal Parmesan!

74
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:22,454
Now you're telling me
I ordered chicken.

75
00:05:22,588 --> 00:05:25,523
It says here that
you ordered chicken, sir.

76
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:26,454
Oh really?

77
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:32,863
I will get you your veal.

78
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,865
Don't you know you're not
supposed to yell at the waiter,

79
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,594
until after you get your food.

80
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:40,665
For all you know
he's probably back

81
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:42,274
there rubbing out
some special sauce for

82
00:05:42,408 --> 00:05:43,875
your veal parm right now...

83
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:46,907
So the boss is missing huh?

84
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,339
Maybe I should call his driver,
what's his name?

85
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,012
Chester.

86
00:05:57,223 --> 00:05:59,350
Hey Chester what's up man?
It's Eddie.

87
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:00,550
What do you want? What?

88
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,257
What the fuck you mean "What?"

89
00:06:02,628 --> 00:06:03,617
Where's the Old Man at man?

90
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:04,455
Listen, this is bullshit!

91
00:06:04,597 --> 00:06:06,497
I already told Junior
I don't know where he is.

92
00:06:10,937 --> 00:06:11,665
What's up?

93
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:14,635
I don't know.

94
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:18,709
Maybe we should check it out.

95
00:06:20,513 --> 00:06:21,707
Yeah, let's get out of here man.

96
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:30,378
You know,
I really don't hate working.

97
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:33,556
It pays the bills so I can take the kids
to the game on Sunday.

98
00:06:34,093 --> 00:06:36,061
Deal a little. Collect a little.

99
00:06:36,195 --> 00:06:38,322
If Junior was asking me
to make the fucking coffee,

100
00:06:38,464 --> 00:06:39,692
I'd be cool with that.

101
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:42,501
Yeah, but he didn't ask you
to get coffee, did he Eddie?

102
00:06:42,635 --> 00:06:46,162
He asked me and Rock to
look for his dad.

103
00:06:46,305 --> 00:06:47,101
Our boss.

104
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,073
The Mother Fucking King
shit of Youngstown.

105
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:53,405
And from the nervous tone
in Chester's voice...

106
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,507
I knew this was going to be bad.

107
00:06:56,482 --> 00:06:57,414
Eddie, you coming?

108
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:15,664
Fucking Junior.

109
00:07:16,135 --> 00:07:18,535
He thinks he can
just treat everyone like shit.

110
00:07:18,871 --> 00:07:21,999
The only thing that punk ever did
was squirt out his daddy's nut.

111
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:26,501
Life's a lottery baby.
You and me bought losing tickets.

112
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:29,176
What are you doing?

113
00:07:29,515 --> 00:07:30,573
I'm putting in hollow points.

114
00:07:30,716 --> 00:07:33,378
I still have jackets in there
from when I was at the range.

115
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:37,619
.45 with hollow points,
blow your head right off.

116
00:07:38,891 --> 00:07:39,823
What you got?

117
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:42,423
I got a gun.
It's got bullets in it.

118
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:05,447
Jesus, look at this dump man.

119
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:08,483
What the hell is Al paying,
minimum wage?

120
00:08:42,788 --> 00:08:44,119
Look at this shit hole.

121
00:08:48,094 --> 00:08:51,860
No! Ahh, Damn it!

122
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:52,987
Where's Al, Chester?

123
00:08:53,132 --> 00:08:54,724
How the fuck
should I know where he is?

124
00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:56,902
He gave me the day off alright.

125
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:59,370
You know what...
Where the fuck is Al?!

126
00:08:59,505 --> 00:09:01,132
All right, all right I'll tell you
whatever you want to know

127
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:02,206
just put the gun down alright.

128
00:09:02,341 --> 00:09:04,775
Hey, take it easy man.
Let's give the man a chance.

129
00:09:04,911 --> 00:09:07,778
That's what I'm giving him,
a chance to save his ass.

130
00:09:10,082 --> 00:09:10,741
All right.

131
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:16,411
I drove Al out to this shack out
in the woods all right.

132
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,854
He said something about
somebody cooking up

133
00:09:18,991 --> 00:09:21,118
some meth without his say so.

134
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:27,294
Fuck.

135
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:35,541
He goes inside and
the whole fucking thing explodes.

136
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:40,069
You saying Al's dead?

137
00:09:40,212 --> 00:09:41,406
There wasn't nothing
I could fucking do about it,

138
00:09:41,547 --> 00:09:43,344
you think I knew the place
was booby-trapped?

139
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:46,680
What's up punk?

140
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:48,517
Where's my fucking Dad huh?

141
00:09:51,123 --> 00:09:52,112
Where is my Dad

142
00:09:52,825 --> 00:09:53,587
Fucker!

143
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:54,590
Ahh, Jesus!

144
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:58,256
If something happened to the Big A,
shit's gonna hit the fan.

145
00:09:58,531 --> 00:09:59,498
Let's you and me stay on the level.

146
00:09:59,632 --> 00:10:01,156
The last thing we need,
is for Junior to think

147
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:04,235
that we are into whatever shady
shit's going on here alright?

148
00:10:04,971 --> 00:10:06,131
Fuck! God Dammit!

149
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:11,174
He was just about to tell us
when you got here.

150
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:13,037
Tell Junior what you told us.

151
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:13,301
Bikers?
You ain't said shit about no bikers.

152
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:15,805
That's what I was trying to
tell you, I tried to save him

153
00:11:20,146 --> 00:11:21,113
Who the fuck are these guys?

154
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:51,040
I only sent him in there to
protect him alright.

155
00:11:51,177 --> 00:11:52,701
I'd take a bullet for that guy.

156
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:54,174
So what happened to
these bikers?

157
00:11:54,413 --> 00:11:56,210
Well, when it exploded they took off.

158
00:11:58,217 --> 00:11:58,808
Come on man!

159
00:11:58,951 --> 00:12:01,112
Look I know how it sounds,
it sounds crazy.

160
00:12:01,587 --> 00:12:03,782
I swear to God it's the truth alright.

161
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:11,360
This guy is lying.

162
00:12:11,597 --> 00:12:12,586
Oh completely!

163
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:15,132
That chicken shit ain't gonna
stand up to no bikers.

164
00:12:15,267 --> 00:12:17,462
I think he and those bikers
set my dad up.

165
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:20,164
Before we kill him
I want to fuck him up.

166
00:12:20,306 --> 00:12:21,898
I want to cut him up and
I want to fucking hurt him

167
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:22,598
but we can't do it here

168
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,710
because the neighbors are
gonna complain about the noise.

169
00:12:24,977 --> 00:12:26,035
What Noise?

170
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:27,974
The blood curdling screams, Eddie.

171
00:12:30,716 --> 00:12:32,741
Hold on. Wait a second.

172
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,952
We don't even know
if there is a meth lab.

173
00:12:36,355 --> 00:12:37,413
Dude, what are you saying?

174
00:12:37,623 --> 00:12:39,989
I'm saying lets
check the story out first.

175
00:12:40,826 --> 00:12:42,054
You're so smart Eddie.

176
00:13:00,412 --> 00:13:03,404
Somebody takes down the king;
they're going to kill the soldiers.

177
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:05,612
Shit you know
that better than anyone.

178
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:08,852
It's just the kind of situation
where a lot of people get killed.

179
00:13:09,054 --> 00:13:13,855
And I ain't one to be one of them.
But for Junior that shit was personal.

180
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,618
Well, what are we waiting for?

181
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:21,896
Hey, Junior.
Take it easy, hey easy!

182
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:24,196
Blood's getting all over the seats.

183
00:13:31,844 --> 00:13:32,970
Hey Man I know.

184
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:36,571
I like Junior. But he's a hot head.

185
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:39,143
He's a hot head and
somebody killed his pops.

186
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:41,076
He flipped the fuck out,
what would you do?

187
00:13:53,365 --> 00:13:56,357
Alright Chester,
where's this frigging lab?

188
00:13:57,303 --> 00:13:59,066
Head north on Route 26.

189
00:14:21,327 --> 00:14:22,225
Holy Shit!

190
00:14:22,995 --> 00:14:24,690
Mother fucker might
have been telling the truth.

191
00:14:28,467 --> 00:14:31,027
See, just like I told you.
I wasn't lying.

192
00:14:35,407 --> 00:14:38,376
He had me stop right here.
And he get up out the car.

193
00:14:38,944 --> 00:14:42,107
And he goes walking up along
here around the far side.

194
00:14:42,481 --> 00:14:44,745
And I stayed here at
the car and then,

195
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:48,209
all the bikers come in
from behind us, right there.

196
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:25,523
Someone killed my fucking dad.

197
00:15:25,724 --> 00:15:27,954
Someone is gonna fucking
pay for this shit.

198
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:35,467
Someone is gonna
fucking pay for this!

199
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:38,193
Where the fuck is Chester at?!

200
00:15:39,004 --> 00:15:40,938
Why the fuck isn't he
in here right now?!

201
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:42,570
Chester?

202
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:42,160
Psst, Eddie.
Come on man you got to help me.

203
00:16:42,301 --> 00:16:43,268
They are going to kill me.

204
00:16:44,436 --> 00:16:45,494
You got to help me
get out of here.

205
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,397
Eddie come on man!

206
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:49,302
Come here Chester.

207
00:16:49,441 --> 00:16:54,845
No Eddie I can't die like this.
No! No!

208
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:01,244
Eddie! Eddie! No!

209
00:17:02,087 --> 00:17:03,554
Eddie! No! No!

210
00:17:04,123 --> 00:17:04,817
Come on!

211
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:06,423
Ahh, no!

212
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:08,355
Get the fuck out of there!
Come Here!

213
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:25,810
I thought you were my friend Eddie.

214
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:34,808
Fucking Asshole!

215
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:39,548
Got me running around the woods
like a fucking moron.

216
00:17:39,925 --> 00:17:40,949
Get the gas can.

217
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:42,384
You're gonna burn him here?

218
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:46,330
No. We'll burn him over there.

219
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:56,302
No!! No!!

220
00:18:08,554 --> 00:18:10,146
I'm sick of your bullshit Chester.

221
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:16,994
Ahh, don't burn me!

222
00:18:17,996 --> 00:18:18,985
You got your lighter Eddie?

223
00:18:21,633 --> 00:18:22,497
Chester.

224
00:18:23,735 --> 00:18:25,669
Tell us how those bikers
set up my dad.

225
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:36,441
I drove your dad out to
that meth lab in the woods.

226
00:18:38,684 --> 00:18:42,984
When we got there,
there was a gang of bikers there.

227
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:58,363
Chester, do something!

228
00:19:14,186 --> 00:19:14,743
You OK?

229
00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:15,785
Yeah, I'm fine.

230
00:19:22,728 --> 00:19:26,630
Wow! You heard that Rock?
That's some real shit homie.

231
00:19:26,765 --> 00:19:27,823
Real shit.

232
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,624
I was gonna save him...

233
00:19:31,603 --> 00:19:35,004
Tell me something,
what kind of gun did Al have?

234
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:39,276
A... Shotgun.

235
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:43,545
Pump action?

236
00:19:43,882 --> 00:19:44,712
Yeah.

237
00:19:45,951 --> 00:19:46,975
No, wait.

238
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:48,848
I wasn't thinking
it wasn't a pump action it

239
00:19:48,987 --> 00:19:50,716
was a double barrel shotgun.

240
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:54,348
Al stopped carrying a gun after
he did that year for gun possession.

241
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:09,365
Burn him Eddie.

242
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:10,065
Stop, Stop, Stop!

243
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:13,406
Listen dude just tell us
how the bikers set up my dad, Ok.

244
00:20:13,645 --> 00:20:15,670
I lied about the gun.
He never had a gun.

245
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:19,817
I tried to save him I swear.
Here's what happened.

246
00:20:20,085 --> 00:20:22,212
Keep your head clear
I'm gonna get you out of this.

247
00:20:22,354 --> 00:20:23,252
Fuck You!

248
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:27,717
We got a problem.

249
00:20:28,493 --> 00:20:30,723
Looks like this place
is wired to explode.

250
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:32,360
I'm fucking out of here.

251
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,258
Al!!!

252
00:20:38,637 --> 00:20:40,537
You're going to be alright Al,
just hang in there.

253
00:20:40,672 --> 00:20:42,606
Don't you let go Al
you stay with me.

254
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:48,209
Son's of Bitches!

255
00:20:58,991 --> 00:21:01,289
And that's what happened.

256
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:09,391
So now we know.

257
00:21:12,237 --> 00:21:14,398
Oh come on, you believe that shit?

258
00:21:14,539 --> 00:21:15,631
Yeah I do believe that shit.

259
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:17,537
Obviously Chester
is not Chuck Norris but yeah,

260
00:21:17,676 --> 00:21:18,574
I believe his story.

261
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:19,573
About what?

262
00:21:19,711 --> 00:21:22,179
About the bikers setting my dad up.

263
00:21:22,347 --> 00:21:22,813
I don't know man.

264
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:25,075
I mean what type of meth dealer
just starts killing people.

265
00:21:25,384 --> 00:21:27,875
I don't know what you guys
want me to tell you man.

266
00:21:29,388 --> 00:21:31,356
We were driving in the car.

267
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:33,720
He gets a phone call.

268
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:37,050
He tells me 'she said
to go out Route'...

269
00:21:42,834 --> 00:21:45,394
Lexy!
He had a girl friend named Lexy.

270
00:21:45,537 --> 00:21:46,367
Dude, what girl friend?

271
00:21:46,505 --> 00:21:48,097
She must have set him up!
That's who you want to talk to.

272
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,264
That's fucking bullshit.
What the fuck?

273
00:21:49,408 --> 00:21:51,501
You saying you know something
about my fucking family?

274
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:54,003
Exotic. Dark

275
00:21:54,413 --> 00:21:56,506
Don't listen to him Momma,
god rest your sacred heart.

276
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:57,171
Hear me out.

277
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,284
You know it sounds to me
like he's finally telling the truth.

278
00:21:59,418 --> 00:22:01,409
It sounds to me like
he's not telling the fucking truth,

279
00:22:01,553 --> 00:22:03,680
and I don't see how you can't
fucking see that Rock.

280
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:04,982
- Please you gotta believe me
- So, why don't you shut the fuck up

281
00:22:05,123 --> 00:22:06,090
- this is true.
- cause I'm in charge here.

282
00:22:06,224 --> 00:22:09,022
And you shut the fuck up,
and you shut the fuck up.

283
00:22:09,227 --> 00:22:11,661
Fuck! Mother fucking Shit!

284
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:12,486
- Eddie, you got to believe me man
- Everybody here needs to

285
00:22:12,631 --> 00:22:14,531
- this really happened.
- shut the fuck up.

286
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:15,690
Lexy must have
set him up alright.

287
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:18,098
I mean she was shady alright.
No! Oh My...

288
00:22:25,477 --> 00:22:30,676
Junior. It's not my place to criticize,
but why the hell you just did that?

289
00:22:31,049 --> 00:22:33,244
I think he was just getting ready
to tell us something.

290
00:22:33,552 --> 00:22:36,112
Dude if my dad's dead then
that makes me the boss.

291
00:22:37,222 --> 00:22:40,214
Why don't you get that bullet back
so the cops don't trace it to my gun.

292
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:46,494
It's still in his head.
Just throw your gun in the river.

293
00:22:46,665 --> 00:22:49,259
I'm not throwing my fucking gun
in the river I like this gun.

294
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:52,295
Just fucking do it.

295
00:23:05,584 --> 00:23:06,642
Why did he just do that,

296
00:23:06,785 --> 00:23:07,581
I mean if you were Junior

297
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:09,346
wouldn't you want to know
who is coming after you.

298
00:23:09,955 --> 00:23:12,253
I've been telling you,
kid's a fucking dope.

299
00:23:15,193 --> 00:23:16,387
I'm not dressed for this shit.

300
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:20,595
Yo, it's his phone man.

301
00:23:26,805 --> 00:23:27,999
What's that chick's name again?

302
00:23:28,607 --> 00:23:29,369
Lexy.

303
00:23:41,953 --> 00:23:42,476
Hello?

304
00:23:42,621 --> 00:23:43,849
Yeah. Lexy?

305
00:23:43,989 --> 00:23:44,978
Yeah, Uh-huh?

306
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:47,087
Hello?

307
00:23:47,225 --> 00:23:48,351
Hold on one second, ok baby?

308
00:23:48,794 --> 00:23:52,195
Yo, Rock you don't hear me
on this fucking phone, man?

309
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:55,596
You don't see me
breaking this head?

310
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:01,905
I'm sorry about that baby, yeah,
look I'm a friend of Al's.

311
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,133
He wanted me to
invite you to this party-but

312
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:04,799
He did?

313
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:06,308
But I kind of forgot your address.

314
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:07,377
Well, just ask Al.

315
00:24:07,512 --> 00:24:09,070
Yeah, Yeah,
I don't want to call him back,

316
00:24:09,214 --> 00:24:09,908
because you know how he is.

317
00:24:10,048 --> 00:24:10,514
Yeah well whatever.

318
00:24:10,649 --> 00:24:12,173
I'm at the party house.
Do you know where that is?

319
00:24:12,317 --> 00:24:12,646
Yeah.

320
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:13,409
I'm with the rest of the girls.

321
00:24:13,552 --> 00:24:15,520
Yeah. Yeah I know right
where that's at, yeah.

322
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,687
Alright, I'll see you in a minute.

323
00:24:16,822 --> 00:24:18,153
Ok. Bye.

324
00:24:21,493 --> 00:24:24,291
Rock, something's wrong
with you man.

325
00:24:36,675 --> 00:24:37,403
What's up, Eddie?

326
00:24:37,542 --> 00:24:38,167
Sup, man.

327
00:24:38,343 --> 00:24:39,310
Yo did you get that bullet?

328
00:24:39,678 --> 00:24:40,372
Rocky's on it.

329
00:24:56,795 --> 00:24:57,955
Dude,
where are we going right now?

330
00:24:58,563 --> 00:24:59,393
Lexy's house.

331
00:24:59,698 --> 00:25:01,632
Gonna follow up on what
Chester told us about.

332
00:25:02,033 --> 00:25:03,728
Dude we already decided
that was a dead end,

333
00:25:03,869 --> 00:25:04,961
we're not going there right now.

334
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:07,470
Check this out,
whoever killed your pops,

335
00:25:07,772 --> 00:25:09,603
is probably coming after us.

336
00:25:17,415 --> 00:25:19,349
I know but I just said we're
not going there right now

337
00:25:19,484 --> 00:25:20,473
so we're not going there.

338
00:25:20,619 --> 00:25:22,052
What the hell is a matter with you?

339
00:25:22,387 --> 00:25:24,048
Don't you want to know
who killed your father?

340
00:25:25,257 --> 00:25:26,815
What man? Go do your job.

341
00:25:32,631 --> 00:25:33,825
This seem sketchy to you?

342
00:25:36,334 --> 00:25:37,130
A little.

343
00:25:38,169 --> 00:25:40,569
Check this out man- you take that side,
I'm gonna go this way.

344
00:26:06,998 --> 00:26:10,195
Listen to me there
is a package on its way,

345
00:26:10,335 --> 00:26:11,666
and do not sign for it.

346
00:27:48,933 --> 00:27:51,401
Hey, Where's your friend?

347
00:28:11,156 --> 00:28:14,057
Hey, look I found this creep outside
playing with himself.

348
00:29:04,709 --> 00:29:05,300
Lexy?

349
00:29:06,211 --> 00:29:07,303
It is Lexy right?

350
00:29:09,013 --> 00:29:11,243
See that's an <i>AK-47</i> you got there.

351
00:29:13,184 --> 00:29:17,484
That's bad news for me baby.
Cause all I got is this here.22.

352
00:29:18,356 --> 00:29:21,325
Thing is, I still got bullets.

353
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:26,791
So Lexy, do you want to
come out peaceful and talk?

354
00:29:29,667 --> 00:29:31,294
Or do you want to
get into a gun fight?

355
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:46,246
What you thought you were
going to get away with it? Huh?

356
00:29:46,384 --> 00:29:46,850
Stop

357
00:29:46,985 --> 00:29:49,010
Get off me!
She killed the Old Man.

358
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:50,648
What the Old Man's dead?

359
00:29:50,889 --> 00:29:52,151
Don't act all surprised.

360
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:53,621
Yeah, what the hell you
shot at us for then?

361
00:29:53,758 --> 00:29:55,225
Cause you were coming to
kill me!

362
00:29:56,928 --> 00:29:59,488
Who told you we were
coming to kill ya? Huh?

363
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:00,996
I asked you a question bitch.

364
00:30:01,099 --> 00:30:04,626
Who told you we were
trying to kill you? Huh? Who...

365
00:30:15,713 --> 00:30:19,046
Fuck! Mother Fucker
Open the God Damn Door!

366
00:30:20,051 --> 00:30:21,643
How can you fucking
do this to me?

367
00:30:21,786 --> 00:30:23,811
What the fuck man?
Get her the fuck out of here.

368
00:30:23,955 --> 00:30:26,048
He's the one that set you up, ok.

369
00:30:26,191 --> 00:30:27,590
He's the one that
said there is a package

370
00:30:27,725 --> 00:30:29,659
to be delivered
and not to sign for it,

371
00:30:29,794 --> 00:30:32,490
and that means kill whatever
motherfucker comes to my door.

372
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:35,390
Open the door you fucking pussy!

373
00:30:35,533 --> 00:30:36,261
Get out of the car Junior.

374
00:30:36,401 --> 00:30:38,335
Dude, I'm not getting out
of the fucking car.

375
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:40,467
I will shoot you right in the face.

376
00:30:41,606 --> 00:30:42,630
Dude, what the fuck?

377
00:30:43,041 --> 00:30:45,009
You don't need to pull
your fucking gun out alright.

378
00:30:45,877 --> 00:30:47,401
What the fuck bitch? Get off!!

379
00:30:47,545 --> 00:30:49,877
You are such
a fucking piece of shit.

380
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:54,375
What do you know about
a meth lab out on Route 26?

381
00:30:57,121 --> 00:31:00,056
Hold on a second,
ok just fucking hold on a second,

382
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:03,251
because I am not about to killed
over some bullshit Junior's doing.

383
00:31:03,394 --> 00:31:05,362
Dude, she's fucking
totally lying right now.

384
00:31:05,496 --> 00:31:08,090
Wait a second. What bullshit?

385
00:31:08,433 --> 00:31:10,424
It was Junior's fucking meth lab.

386
00:31:10,668 --> 00:31:11,362
What Bitch?!

387
00:31:11,502 --> 00:31:15,461
You said that you loved me!!!
You said that you loved me.

388
00:31:15,607 --> 00:31:19,168
Bullshit, like I would fucking
say that shit to this fucking-

389
00:31:22,146 --> 00:31:25,445
Whoa whoa Whoa!
What are you doing?

390
00:31:25,516 --> 00:31:26,380
I'm going to kill him.

391
00:31:26,517 --> 00:31:28,382
Al's dead. That means he's the boss.

392
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:29,952
I don't know about you Eddie,

393
00:31:30,088 --> 00:31:32,522
but when a tries to kill me
he crosses a line.

394
00:31:32,657 --> 00:31:33,681
We can't whack this dude

395
00:31:33,825 --> 00:31:36,885
until we find out
what the fuck is going on. Ok?

396
00:31:37,295 --> 00:31:38,626
Get in the car whore.

397
00:31:42,033 --> 00:31:43,466
Ahh! Help me!

398
00:31:43,668 --> 00:31:44,657
What the hell is that Rock?

399
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:46,134
Nothing.

400
00:31:46,271 --> 00:31:48,432
Someone help me!

401
00:31:49,007 --> 00:31:49,837
Idiot.

402
00:32:03,187 --> 00:32:04,347
Shut up.

403
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,126
Someone fucking help me.

404
00:32:12,163 --> 00:32:15,826
Seemed like the more we found out,
the less we knew.

405
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:19,365
Now I never thought Junior
would kill his own pops,

406
00:32:19,504 --> 00:32:20,698
but he lied to us.

407
00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:23,102
You can't blame Rocky
for freaking out.

408
00:32:23,241 --> 00:32:27,803
Hey Man, Rocky's a soldier.
Soldier's kill.

409
00:32:40,758 --> 00:32:42,123
Whoa Whoa Whoa Whoa.

410
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:44,091
I said I'm gonna tell you
what you want to know man.

411
00:32:45,263 --> 00:32:46,389
I said I'm gonna tell you
what you want to know-

412
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:57,933
Please,

413
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:05,472
No No Don't.

414
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:09,885
I didn't set up Al, ok.

415
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:12,585
I might have been fucking his son,

416
00:33:12,724 --> 00:33:14,021
but that doesn't mean
I wanted to kill him.

417
00:33:17,195 --> 00:33:18,822
I thought that Junior loved me.

418
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:20,158
An 'I love you' from Junior

419
00:33:20,298 --> 00:33:22,732
and fifty cents might
buy you a cup of coffee.

420
00:33:22,867 --> 00:33:24,129
Where are we going?

421
00:33:24,435 --> 00:33:25,561
Yeah where are we going?

422
00:33:26,104 --> 00:33:27,071
The Asylum.

423
00:33:30,908 --> 00:33:33,604
Look, one way or another
I'm gonna get to the truth.

424
00:33:33,745 --> 00:33:36,475
And the Asylum is
the fucking ministry of truth.

425
00:34:04,976 --> 00:34:10,846
Ouch, Ow you fucker!

426
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:14,777
Hold the fuck up,
this is Armani, Hold up.

427
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:25,260
Lexy Get your ass out the car.

428
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:36,736
This is Bullshit Rocky!
Fuck You.

429
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:41,843
You want to do this hard way Junior,
it's ok with me.

430
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:00,294
Lexy get her side.

431
00:35:07,505 --> 00:35:08,335
Fuck off Rock.

432
00:35:08,473 --> 00:35:09,064
Take a seat.

433
00:35:09,207 --> 00:35:10,071
FUCK OFF!

434
00:35:11,075 --> 00:35:12,337
Sit the fuck down.

435
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:25,820
Moans in agony.

436
00:35:27,558 --> 00:35:29,389
It's ok.

437
00:35:40,838 --> 00:35:43,033
Don't bother sweetie,
windows nailed shut.

438
00:35:43,541 --> 00:35:44,439
Just have a seat.

439
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:52,108
You ain't such
a big shot now are ya?

440
00:35:58,022 --> 00:35:58,545
Rock.

441
00:36:05,062 --> 00:36:06,620
Let's take a breath for a second, ok?

442
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:09,561
Where the fuck
are we going with this?

443
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:11,332
Well let's start with the truth.

444
00:36:11,435 --> 00:36:14,029
This could be part of something
much bigger than we think.

445
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:17,301
If he set up his dad,
who is he working with?

446
00:36:18,809 --> 00:36:21,369
Ok. What do you want to do?

447
00:36:21,646 --> 00:36:22,738
Do what I did in the army.

448
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:23,676
When I'm done with him

449
00:36:23,814 --> 00:36:25,475
he going to tell us
whatever we want.

450
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:28,011
Now get that barrel
fill it up with water.

451
00:36:28,219 --> 00:36:29,846
I'll show you a little trick I learned.

452
00:36:34,125 --> 00:36:36,355
You set us up Junior, Why?

453
00:36:36,494 --> 00:36:38,826
Because I didn't want you
to know I was boning Lexy.

454
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:41,430
Now let me out of here
before I have you killed.

455
00:36:42,266 --> 00:36:42,823
Hold it Junior.

456
00:36:42,967 --> 00:36:45,367
Here is what happened,
you set your dad up,

457
00:36:45,503 --> 00:36:48,131
then you tried to set us up
because we were on to you.

458
00:36:48,306 --> 00:36:51,036
Dude, fuck you man.
I fucking loved my dad.

459
00:36:51,242 --> 00:36:54,234
Oh, that's why you were
fucking his girl?

460
00:36:54,412 --> 00:36:56,039
So that's what this is about huh?

461
00:36:56,347 --> 00:36:59,510
Your jealous cause my dad gave birth
to a player and he made you a clown.

462
00:37:00,017 --> 00:37:01,416
You didn't know that did you?

463
00:37:01,652 --> 00:37:03,916
That's what he calls you -
his fucking little clown.

464
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:10,087
You guys are making the biggest
fucking mistakes of your lives.

465
00:37:10,294 --> 00:37:13,661
With him gone you inherit
the entire operation.

466
00:37:13,798 --> 00:37:15,925
You had every reason
to whack him

467
00:37:16,267 --> 00:37:17,291
FUCK!

468
00:37:17,501 --> 00:37:18,729
Who else is in on this?

469
00:37:18,869 --> 00:37:20,530
Who else was in on what?

470
00:37:26,043 --> 00:37:27,203
Who else Junior?

471
00:37:27,478 --> 00:37:29,036
I don't know what the fuck
you're talking about

472
00:37:29,146 --> 00:37:33,640
God Dammit if you fucking hit me
one more time. Fuck.

473
00:37:35,219 --> 00:37:36,447
Now that felt good.

474
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,628
Eddie, please help me.

475
00:38:09,887 --> 00:38:11,650
Who else was in on this?

476
00:38:12,823 --> 00:38:16,384
Nobody. It was my lab ok.

477
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:19,194
Now we're getting somewhere.

478
00:38:20,564 --> 00:38:22,589
And your dad found out
so you killed him.

479
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:23,257
No, no.

480
00:38:23,401 --> 00:38:24,095
It was booby-trapped

481
00:38:24,235 --> 00:38:26,260
but I didn't think
he'd be the one going in it.

482
00:38:26,937 --> 00:38:27,801
It was Lexy and me.

483
00:38:27,938 --> 00:38:29,929
We were just trying to
make extra cash on the side.

484
00:38:31,776 --> 00:38:34,745
Ok that sounds reasonable, right?

485
00:38:36,847 --> 00:38:38,280
Let's let the kid go, man.

486
00:38:38,416 --> 00:38:41,852
Let him go?
You're usually so smart Eddie.

487
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:43,783
We can't just kill the kid.

488
00:38:43,921 --> 00:38:45,252
I didn't say kill the kid.

489
00:38:45,389 --> 00:38:47,482
Did you hear me say anything
about kill the kid.

490
00:38:47,925 --> 00:38:51,019
Eddie, go check his story with Lexy.

491
00:38:51,228 --> 00:38:52,252
I'm telling you Junior,

492
00:38:52,396 --> 00:38:55,524
if you are lying to me
you're going in that fucking barrel.

493
00:38:57,468 --> 00:38:59,368
Open the fucking door!

494
00:39:03,407 --> 00:39:04,669
God dammit!

495
00:39:18,656 --> 00:39:19,452
Did you kill him?

496
00:39:21,325 --> 00:39:25,989
Relax, Lexy.
Nobody's killing nobody. Alright?

497
00:39:28,232 --> 00:39:29,164
You want to smoke?

498
00:39:30,134 --> 00:39:30,930
Thanks.

499
00:39:38,509 --> 00:39:39,373
What did he say?

500
00:39:40,244 --> 00:39:42,906
Did he try and blame it all on me
because it was his fucking idea.

501
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,271
He said that you and him
set up the meth lab on the side

502
00:39:45,416 --> 00:39:49,113
to make a few extra bucks.
Said you booby trapped it

503
00:39:49,253 --> 00:39:51,118
but you never expected Al
to go in there.

504
00:39:52,757 --> 00:39:53,724
Yeah that's right.

505
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:56,192
I mean that's exactly
what happened.

506
00:40:03,267 --> 00:40:04,461
She said the same thing Junior said.

507
00:40:04,602 --> 00:40:05,261
It was their meth lab

508
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:06,836
Great, get me the fuck out of here.

509
00:40:06,971 --> 00:40:08,836
That only leaves ones lose end.

510
00:40:08,973 --> 00:40:09,598
What's that?

511
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,571
The bikers Chester was talking about.

512
00:40:11,809 --> 00:40:13,276
Dude he was fucking lying.

513
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:14,742
Yeah? Prove it.

514
00:40:15,513 --> 00:40:21,247
Whoa Whoa, rock don't do this man.

515
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:25,180
Look, maybe he is telling the truth
and maybe he's setting us up again.

516
00:40:25,322 --> 00:40:27,517
Suppose we let him go and
he is working with the bikers.

517
00:40:27,658 --> 00:40:28,784
Then we're frigging dead.

518
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:30,757
I'm not gonna take his word for it.

519
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:33,021
I'm gonna ask you
one more time Junior.

520
00:40:33,164 --> 00:40:34,529
Who are those guys?

521
00:40:34,799 --> 00:40:36,926
I told you a million times already,

522
00:40:37,067 --> 00:40:39,035
I swear to god
there were no other guys.

523
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:41,638
Alright, whatever you guys are
gonna do, just don't do it.

524
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:44,866
Ok please, I swear I'm gonna
keep you guys on. I promise.

525
00:40:45,009 --> 00:40:46,909
It's not you
I'm worried about Junior,

526
00:40:47,044 --> 00:40:49,706
it's the guys I don't know
that got me twisted.

527
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:52,082
Grab him Eddie.

528
00:40:53,617 --> 00:41:06,929
No! No! No!

529
00:41:16,106 --> 00:41:16,868
Now what?

530
00:41:17,408 --> 00:41:18,204
We wait.

531
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:27,840
How long we gonna keep him in here?

532
00:41:28,552 --> 00:41:30,019
Everybody's different.

533
00:41:41,699 --> 00:41:43,462
You going to
Sonny's wedding next week?

534
00:41:43,801 --> 00:41:44,563
What?

535
00:41:44,802 --> 00:41:46,736
Sonny's wedding.
He is getting married next week.

536
00:41:46,871 --> 00:41:48,736
Shut the fuck up and do this man.
Come on.

537
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:56,139
That a boy.

538
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:10,717
You know, you are too tense Eddie.

539
00:42:33,884 --> 00:42:35,909
Alright it's been a minute man,
come on.

540
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:37,384
It ain't a matter of minutes.

541
00:42:37,821 --> 00:42:39,755
It's a matter of
how long he can hold out.

542
00:42:51,101 --> 00:42:53,968
You know I'm beginning to wonder
if you got the heart for this Eddie.

543
00:42:55,673 --> 00:42:57,504
Hey look we should
get him out right now ok.

544
00:42:57,675 --> 00:42:59,643
Nah, I think he
is playing Opossum.

545
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:03,039
Come on, let's get him out. Come on.

546
00:43:03,981 --> 00:43:05,107
Yeah alright.

547
00:43:16,226 --> 00:43:17,523
Shit I think he's dead Rock.

548
00:43:17,661 --> 00:43:19,390
Nah. Hold his feet up.

549
00:43:48,993 --> 00:43:52,520
You know, it really pains me
to keep doing this to you Junior.

550
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:55,896
But if you don't start telling me
who those bikers are,

551
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:57,631
I'm just going to keep dunking you.

552
00:44:10,114 --> 00:44:10,978
Ah fuck!

553
00:44:13,083 --> 00:44:14,243
Ah shit.

554
00:44:14,451 --> 00:44:15,713
Please just don't
dunk me anymore.

555
00:44:15,853 --> 00:44:16,820
Ok I swear to god
I am going to tell you

556
00:44:16,954 --> 00:44:17,943
what ever you guys want to hear.

557
00:44:18,088 --> 00:44:19,521
So who are these bikers?

558
00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:22,520
Lexy told me about them.

559
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:24,651
See, what did I tell you?

560
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:28,328
It was her idea from the start.

561
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:40,909
Baby I don't know
why you can't just meet with them

562
00:44:41,045 --> 00:44:42,808
and see what they have to say.

563
00:44:43,447 --> 00:44:45,779
Because, they're just trying to
make money in Youngstown.

564
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:48,143
And as far as
I am concerned it's a closed city.

565
00:44:48,819 --> 00:44:50,753
My pops runs it and
he doesn't want any partners.

566
00:44:50,888 --> 00:44:52,355
Baby, your daddy is old.

567
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:55,056
He ain't gonna be
around forever and then what?

568
00:44:55,926 --> 00:44:59,123
You really think you got
enough juice to keep it together.

569
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:00,662
Yeah I do think I have enough juice.

570
00:45:00,798 --> 00:45:02,493
Why don't you ride
my fucking jimmy.

571
00:45:02,633 --> 00:45:03,827
I don't think so.

572
00:45:05,602 --> 00:45:07,399
Spanky says it's a whole new world.

573
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:10,803
Yo, what the fuck did you just say,
did you just fucking say Spanky.

574
00:45:11,675 --> 00:45:13,404
So you fucking met with these guys.

575
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:15,136
Yeah I just want to hear
what they had to say.

576
00:45:16,113 --> 00:45:17,603
There's no harm in that right?

577
00:45:17,848 --> 00:45:19,406
Actually there is
fucking harm in that.

578
00:45:20,617 --> 00:45:22,016
Now I got to clean up this mess.

579
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:24,881
I'm sorry I didn't know.

580
00:45:29,993 --> 00:45:33,190
I don't know why you fucking do this
to me every fucking time.

581
00:45:34,064 --> 00:45:35,497
It's like you don't understand

582
00:45:35,632 --> 00:45:38,066
that everything I fucking
do I do for you.

583
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:39,725
Psyche.

584
00:45:40,537 --> 00:45:42,095
You what's up control it's K.

585
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:43,536
Yo we got a situation.

586
00:45:44,041 --> 00:45:47,807
Yo get the fuck of me rat.
Yeah you best come correct.

587
00:46:27,918 --> 00:46:30,819
Yo are you Spanky?

588
00:46:31,588 --> 00:46:32,816
Al's kid.

589
00:46:36,426 --> 00:46:37,154
Get'em out.

590
00:46:38,529 --> 00:46:41,089
Alright everyone get the fuck out.
Party's over. Get out.

591
00:46:45,936 --> 00:46:48,097
Sit down.
Somebody get this boy a beer.

592
00:46:52,910 --> 00:46:55,276
Lexy has said some pretty
good things about you.

593
00:46:55,913 --> 00:46:57,744
Says you want to
make some money.

594
00:46:59,149 --> 00:47:00,411
Who doesn't want to make money?

595
00:47:01,051 --> 00:47:02,040
Your old man.

596
00:47:02,452 --> 00:47:04,852
He's more interested in
playing cops and robbers.

597
00:47:06,056 --> 00:47:07,114
That's what you think huh?

598
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:09,516
Well don't be fooled
cause he likes money.

599
00:47:11,728 --> 00:47:13,195
Let Isis christen this for you.

600
00:47:38,455 --> 00:47:41,788
I'm going to have a war
with your daddy. Here's the deal.

601
00:47:42,226 --> 00:47:46,390
You help me kill your old man,
and I let you live.

602
00:47:48,465 --> 00:47:50,592
Maybe I'll throw you
in a few scraps.

603
00:47:52,269 --> 00:47:53,497
You want a fucking war?

604
00:47:53,637 --> 00:47:55,229
Do you want a fucking war
then bring it.

605
00:47:57,608 --> 00:48:00,133
I am ready to die mother fucker,
how about you.

606
00:48:00,410 --> 00:48:02,901
You ready to get
your friend here killed to?

607
00:48:18,996 --> 00:48:21,362
Dude this is fucking bullshit, man.
What the fuck are we doing here?

608
00:48:21,431 --> 00:48:22,728
Yo I need you to stay with me bro.

609
00:48:22,866 --> 00:48:24,731
I'm gonna get us out of
this shit so just relax.

610
00:48:24,868 --> 00:48:25,596
Have you seen this shit?

611
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:26,862
They're gonna cut
my fucking dick off.

612
00:48:27,004 --> 00:48:28,904
Yo why you acting like
a little bitch right now?

613
00:48:29,273 --> 00:48:30,672
Huh? Why you acting like a bitch?

614
00:48:32,576 --> 00:48:37,513
Yo, Yo! I don't even know this dude,
man, dude I'm shit...

615
00:48:46,857 --> 00:48:49,485
Shit you guys had me
so fucking scared.

616
00:49:15,819 --> 00:49:18,151
I knew you were a faggot
when you didn't drink that beer.

617
00:49:19,589 --> 00:49:23,252
Life is about getting your dick wet
in as much poontang as possible.

618
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:24,458
Poontang?

619
00:49:25,295 --> 00:49:27,388
Is that your sister's name
you fucking hillbilly?

620
00:49:37,007 --> 00:49:38,998
You had your chance. You blew it.

621
00:49:39,743 --> 00:49:42,303
Right now Lexy's
setting up your old man.

622
00:49:42,679 --> 00:49:44,271
He'll be dead in five minutes.

623
00:49:44,348 --> 00:49:45,576
Baby, what are you taking to?

624
00:49:46,750 --> 00:49:47,444
You'll see.

625
00:49:47,584 --> 00:49:51,748
It's a goddamn school bus.
Come on. I ain't going in there. Come on

626
00:49:51,888 --> 00:49:52,980
Come on.

627
00:49:55,392 --> 00:49:56,723
There's a surprise

628
00:49:56,893 --> 00:49:57,416
Oh yeah?

629
00:49:57,594 --> 00:49:58,185
Uh huh.

630
00:49:59,062 --> 00:50:00,927
So you can see
why I shot Chester

631
00:50:01,064 --> 00:50:02,656
and you can see
why I set Lexy up -

632
00:50:02,799 --> 00:50:05,267
so she'd get killed not
the other way around.

633
00:50:06,203 --> 00:50:07,295
The only reason
I lied to you guys was

634
00:50:07,437 --> 00:50:10,065
because I didn't want you to think
I had something to do with it.

635
00:50:11,308 --> 00:50:12,400
I love my dad.

636
00:50:20,150 --> 00:50:22,277
Welcome to some shit
called reality.

637
00:50:41,271 --> 00:50:42,568
To bad you're not a bitch,

638
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:45,037
or I'd let you suck
your way out of this.

639
00:51:14,104 --> 00:51:16,834
And you just broke the ropes
and kicked every body's ass?

640
00:51:17,474 --> 00:51:21,205
When you got to throw down
you got to buck up.

641
00:51:22,679 --> 00:51:24,442
Do me a favor. Break those.

642
00:51:26,216 --> 00:51:27,080
Right now?

643
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:29,878
Yeah, yeah.
I believe your story and all,

644
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:32,215
it's just so bad ass
I got to see you do it.

645
00:51:38,161 --> 00:51:39,594
These ones are stronger.

646
00:51:41,198 --> 00:51:44,361
Rock. Go easy man

647
00:51:47,838 --> 00:51:49,703
Shouldn't you be checking the girls.

648
00:52:21,104 --> 00:52:21,968
You got to help her.

649
00:52:22,105 --> 00:52:24,801
She is going to the doctor as soon as
I find out what the hell is going on.

650
00:52:24,941 --> 00:52:25,373
You know what?

651
00:52:25,509 --> 00:52:27,067
I don't know
what the fuck is going on.

652
00:52:27,277 --> 00:52:29,745
Nah, that's not what Junior said.

653
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:30,904
What did he tell you?

654
00:52:31,248 --> 00:52:33,580
Man that was a great story Junior.

655
00:52:34,384 --> 00:52:37,182
You just took on all those guys,
you didn't even have a gun?

656
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:38,844
You know I know karate and shit,

657
00:52:38,989 --> 00:52:42,083
so I just fucking took
one from the bikers.

658
00:52:43,527 --> 00:52:44,653
How many was it?

659
00:52:46,096 --> 00:52:47,358
Probably like ten.

660
00:52:48,598 --> 00:52:50,998
Eight. Probably eight.
It was probably like eight.

661
00:52:51,535 --> 00:52:53,230
Show me some of that shit.

662
00:52:53,637 --> 00:52:55,264
Show you some of what shit?

663
00:52:55,472 --> 00:52:56,336
That karate

664
00:52:57,407 --> 00:52:58,066
Karate?

665
00:52:58,208 --> 00:53:00,301
Yeah yeah.
Show me some of your moves.

666
00:53:01,378 --> 00:53:04,506
Come on Rock, I don't want to
fucking show you some moves and shit.

667
00:53:04,648 --> 00:53:07,116
Come on show me some karate.

668
00:53:07,584 --> 00:53:09,745
If you show me some karate
I'll believe you.

669
00:53:12,255 --> 00:53:13,984
Rock, I don't want to
fucking mess you up,

670
00:53:14,124 --> 00:53:14,818
you don't understand?

671
00:53:14,958 --> 00:53:17,119
If I believe you I'll let you go.

672
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:25,129
Try some of that shit on me.

673
00:53:33,343 --> 00:53:36,073
Ok. Just back up ok?

674
00:54:01,871 --> 00:54:02,803
Ahh, fuck.

675
00:54:03,974 --> 00:54:04,838
So what you believed him?

676
00:54:05,942 --> 00:54:06,738
I don't know.

677
00:54:23,326 --> 00:54:26,386
Listen you seem like a smart guy.

678
00:54:27,530 --> 00:54:29,725
Get us out of here and I can save you.

679
00:54:29,866 --> 00:54:30,764
Save me from what?

680
00:54:31,234 --> 00:54:31,996
The Horde.

681
00:54:34,838 --> 00:54:36,396
Are you fucking stupid?

682
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:40,869
I set up Al. OK?

683
00:54:42,679 --> 00:54:47,207
I met with spanky we made a plan
and I set him up

684
00:55:08,738 --> 00:55:10,763
Baby what are you taking me to?

685
00:55:11,107 --> 00:55:11,869
You'll see.

686
00:55:12,008 --> 00:55:16,206
It's a goddamn school bus.
Come on. I ain't going in there. Come on

687
00:55:16,346 --> 00:55:17,506
Come on.

688
00:55:19,849 --> 00:55:21,146
There's a surprise

689
00:55:21,284 --> 00:55:21,773
Oh yeah?

690
00:55:21,918 --> 00:55:22,907
Uh huh.

691
00:55:35,131 --> 00:55:37,463
This is a meth lab,
you want to fuck in a meth lab?

692
00:55:37,901 --> 00:55:40,301
Yeah baby it turns me on.

693
00:55:42,305 --> 00:55:46,674
Look it's dirty, let's go to a motel.
Come on, Jacuzzi.

694
00:55:47,777 --> 00:55:49,142
You have got to be kidding me.

695
00:55:50,013 --> 00:55:52,811
You say you want it nasty,
you say you want it dirty.

696
00:55:52,949 --> 00:55:54,348
I go to all the trouble
to find this place

697
00:55:54,484 --> 00:55:56,008
and this is how you repay me.

698
00:55:57,053 --> 00:55:58,247
You know what, fuck you.

699
00:55:59,055 --> 00:56:01,580
Lexy?! Lexy, wait a minute.

700
00:56:02,525 --> 00:56:04,959
Hey you want to fuck in a meth lab.

701
00:56:05,595 --> 00:56:08,155
Come on, let's fuck in a meth lab.

702
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:14,227
Yeah that's right, Oh Baby!

703
00:56:15,872 --> 00:56:17,863
That's what I'm talking about.

704
00:56:18,608 --> 00:56:19,472
Come in here.

705
00:56:27,417 --> 00:56:28,315
Sit down.

706
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:30,712
Oh Yeah!

707
00:56:30,854 --> 00:56:31,752
Shut up.

708
00:56:43,633 --> 00:56:45,931
Where you going?
Come here.

709
00:56:48,772 --> 00:56:51,866
What are you doing?
Come on take that jacket off.

710
00:56:53,743 --> 00:56:54,732
Sorry Al

711
00:56:56,746 --> 00:56:58,611
Sorry for what? Come on.

712
00:57:09,859 --> 00:57:10,723
Put that down.

713
00:57:14,330 --> 00:57:15,194
What the fuck you doing?

714
00:57:19,569 --> 00:57:20,627
It was either you are me.

715
00:57:20,937 --> 00:57:23,770
You are me?
You fucking bitch!

716
00:57:24,741 --> 00:57:28,006
After what I've done for you,
you sell me out.

717
00:57:30,313 --> 00:57:32,679
Lexy, come on I was kidding.

718
00:57:33,883 --> 00:57:36,078
Chester! Chester!

719
00:57:37,086 --> 00:57:39,486
Chester! Chester!

720
00:57:39,923 --> 00:57:41,413
CHESTER!!!!!!!

721
00:57:59,209 --> 00:58:00,904
CHESTER!!!!!!!

722
00:58:15,925 --> 00:58:16,584
Why?

723
00:58:19,262 --> 00:58:20,194
Why do you think?

724
00:58:24,868 --> 00:58:26,460
Spanky told me to.

725
00:58:29,873 --> 00:58:32,068
Man the horde is a special kind of evil.

726
00:58:33,309 --> 00:58:35,743
They've been killing their way up
north for the last six months.

727
00:58:36,312 --> 00:58:37,540
Anyone who gets in their way.

728
00:58:38,348 --> 00:58:40,043
I'm not just talking about
gangsters here ok,

729
00:58:40,183 --> 00:58:43,277
they will take out whole
fucking families.

730
00:58:43,653 --> 00:58:45,746
Women, Children,
it doesn't matter.

731
00:58:48,224 --> 00:58:50,954
You think Spanky is going to
stop just because Al is dead.

732
00:58:51,861 --> 00:58:55,922
He is taking out his whole crew.
And that means you.

733
00:58:59,903 --> 00:59:04,135
It's not too late. I can save you.
I know Spanky, I can get you in.

734
00:59:04,674 --> 00:59:06,164
Whoa whoa whoa.

735
00:59:06,309 --> 00:59:07,867
You saying junior
was telling the truth?

736
00:59:08,011 --> 00:59:10,571
Al is dead.
You don't owe him anything.

737
00:59:11,481 --> 00:59:13,312
Ok just get me out of here

738
00:59:13,449 --> 00:59:16,418
and I will make sure
that Spanky takes care of you.

739
00:59:20,290 --> 00:59:22,588
Yo Rocky! Yo rock.

740
00:59:23,359 --> 00:59:24,758
Yo the kid was telling the truth man.

741
00:59:24,961 --> 00:59:26,986
Hey man,
Junior was telling the truth.

742
00:59:27,130 --> 00:59:28,893
Lexy set up the old man.

743
00:59:29,132 --> 00:59:29,791
No shit?

744
00:59:29,933 --> 00:59:30,991
Yeah man
she just told me everything.

745
00:59:31,134 --> 00:59:32,465
She did it just the way-

746
00:59:40,343 --> 00:59:41,275
Forget it Eddie.

747
00:59:41,578 --> 00:59:43,512
He stopped twitching
three minutes ago.

748
00:59:48,585 --> 00:59:49,882
What the fuck is wrong with you.

749
01:00:21,551 --> 01:00:23,143
Eddie he has been out to long.

750
01:00:23,319 --> 01:00:25,583
Look I need more juice man,
rev up the engine for me ok?

751
01:00:27,156 --> 01:00:28,987
Rocky, rev up the fucking engine!

752
01:00:50,847 --> 01:00:51,779
He's alive.

753
01:00:52,949 --> 01:00:53,973
Holy Shit!

754
01:01:02,191 --> 01:01:06,218
Nah, he's been out to long,
he's a fucking retard.

755
01:01:07,430 --> 01:01:10,092
You sick bastard.
You just fucked up Junior.

756
01:01:10,266 --> 01:01:10,698
What?

757
01:01:10,833 --> 01:01:12,494
He was gonna run
his dad's business?

758
01:01:12,635 --> 01:01:13,829
Don't make me laugh.

759
01:01:14,137 --> 01:01:14,762
You know Eddie,

760
01:01:14,904 --> 01:01:17,805
when the world gives you lemons
it's time to make lemonade.

761
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:22,576
Think about it. The boss is dead.
Junior's dead.

762
01:01:22,712 --> 01:01:25,010
And nobody knows
about it except us.

763
01:01:25,248 --> 01:01:28,183
If we play our cards we could be
at the top of the food chain.

764
01:01:28,317 --> 01:01:32,117
Are you fucking deaf?
The Horde, they're already here!

765
01:01:32,255 --> 01:01:32,880
They're real.

766
01:01:33,022 --> 01:01:35,855
Without the organization
we are on our own - we are fucked!

767
01:01:35,992 --> 01:01:38,256
You say that broad upstairs
knows where they hang?

768
01:01:38,695 --> 01:01:41,391
Let's have her set up a meeting
between us and Spanky.

769
01:01:41,531 --> 01:01:44,227
Then, when we know he's
there with his top guys, we burn it.

770
01:01:44,367 --> 01:01:47,700
I mean we jam the doors shut,
torch it with everyone inside.

771
01:01:47,804 --> 01:01:49,362
Anybody that runs out,
we shoot them.

772
01:01:49,505 --> 01:01:51,405
You are out of
your fucking mind Rock.

773
01:01:51,507 --> 01:01:54,806
Oh, come on Eddie.
This is our moment to shine,

774
01:01:54,944 --> 01:01:57,208
our moment in the sun
where we get everything

775
01:01:57,346 --> 01:02:01,305
that's coming to us without
big Al taking forty percent.

776
01:02:04,854 --> 01:02:06,549
Are you with me or against me?

777
01:02:08,124 --> 01:02:09,751
Yeah, I'm with you.

778
01:02:11,427 --> 01:02:13,725
So I'm going to take care of Lexy
and then we'll boogie.

779
01:02:13,863 --> 01:02:15,728
That a boy. Hey Hey hey.

780
01:02:15,832 --> 01:02:17,891
You know,
if you like her so much

781
01:02:18,034 --> 01:02:19,934
you should just fuck her
before you kill her.

782
01:02:21,904 --> 01:02:22,768
I tell you what give me five

783
01:02:22,905 --> 01:02:24,770
and then we going to
boogie out of here. OK?

784
01:02:27,443 --> 01:02:28,341
But use your knife.

785
01:02:31,180 --> 01:02:32,306
That's my gun Rock.

786
01:02:32,448 --> 01:02:34,473
Yeah I know. But I want you to
use your knife.

787
01:02:34,617 --> 01:02:37,313
Mother fucker I just told you
that I was with you.

788
01:02:38,154 --> 01:02:39,121
Use your knife.

789
01:02:41,891 --> 01:02:43,859
Yeah. Ok. It's like that.

790
01:02:44,293 --> 01:02:46,090
Alright. Give me a few minutes
I'll be right back.

791
01:02:49,465 --> 01:02:50,159
Let's go.

792
01:02:51,701 --> 01:02:53,430
Listen you said you could
get me in with the Horde right?

793
01:02:53,569 --> 01:02:55,264
Yeah, I mean you haven't
done anything to cut them.

794
01:02:55,404 --> 01:02:57,065
I'm just trying not to
get killed, ok?

795
01:02:57,206 --> 01:02:58,298
Yeah well me too.

796
01:03:01,844 --> 01:03:02,742
Let's go, come on.

797
01:03:02,879 --> 01:03:04,346
Wait, I'm not leaving without her.

798
01:03:05,381 --> 01:03:07,645
Look, I'm not fucking
leaving without her.

799
01:03:09,285 --> 01:03:10,309
I'm going to get a car.

800
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:11,077
I'll meet you out front.

801
01:03:11,220 --> 01:03:13,017
Have her down stairs,
you understand me?

802
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:17,525
Some wounds run deep Junior.

803
01:03:17,827 --> 01:03:18,816
They never heal.

804
01:03:19,495 --> 01:03:24,432
They just keep festering and festering
like a scab you can't help picking at.

805
01:03:25,301 --> 01:03:28,031
I don't know if killing you is going to
make me feel any better.

806
01:03:28,437 --> 01:03:32,373
But sometimes you just
want to grab hold of that scab

807
01:03:32,708 --> 01:03:34,642
and rip the mother fucker off!!

808
01:03:49,559 --> 01:03:52,619
You know that
did make me feel better.

809
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:10,577
Yo, Eddie.

810
01:04:12,648 --> 01:04:13,512
Just go.

811
01:04:27,897 --> 01:04:28,955
Eddie You done yet?

812
01:04:35,838 --> 01:04:38,932
You know if she ain't dead yet,
I wouldn't mind sloppy seconds.

813
01:04:42,311 --> 01:04:43,039
Eddie?

814
01:05:02,098 --> 01:05:03,224
Where did they go whore?

815
01:05:08,204 --> 01:05:12,004
What are you gonna do?
Kill me?

816
01:08:21,864 --> 01:08:23,388
Packed everything?
You took long enough.

817
01:08:26,135 --> 01:08:31,095
Look, Eddie, I know you think
I am some sort of back stabbing whore...

818
01:08:33,375 --> 01:08:37,505
but it's not what you think,
you can trust me.

819
01:08:42,918 --> 01:08:43,976
You trying to play me?

820
01:08:46,856 --> 01:08:48,255
I gotta tell you something ok...

821
01:08:49,391 --> 01:08:50,153
What?

822
01:08:53,395 --> 01:08:58,389
All that stuff I said about
Spanky and the Horde,

823
01:08:58,534 --> 01:09:04,632
and setting up Al. I lied.

824
01:09:11,780 --> 01:09:14,112
That was a dumb shit move
coming back here Eddie.

825
01:09:15,084 --> 01:09:16,108
You sick Mother fucker.

826
01:09:16,252 --> 01:09:17,685
Come on out,
I'm not going to kill you

827
01:09:17,820 --> 01:09:19,811
Crazy bastard.
I'm gonna fucking kill you Rock.

828
01:09:19,955 --> 01:09:21,217
That's just the pussy talking.

829
01:09:21,357 --> 01:09:24,121
The bitch has got your head
so wound you can't see the reality.

830
01:09:24,260 --> 01:09:25,318
What reality?

831
01:09:26,195 --> 01:09:28,755
Our reality.
The one we choose.

832
01:09:28,898 --> 01:09:31,332
Not the one we got because
we were born poor and dumb.

833
01:09:31,467 --> 01:09:35,096
I'm talking about the one we create
where we're the masters of our world.

834
01:09:35,237 --> 01:09:36,431
Leave me alone.

835
01:09:37,640 --> 01:09:42,077
What are three elements of life?
Money, Pussy, Power.

836
01:09:42,378 --> 01:09:44,437
That's all within our grasp.

837
01:09:44,713 --> 01:09:46,806
We just need to show
some fucking resolve.

838
01:09:46,949 --> 01:09:48,507
Then Rock, go ahead and do it.

839
01:09:48,717 --> 01:09:51,049
Nobody is stopping you,
go on and take on the Horde,

840
01:09:51,187 --> 01:09:52,449
but do it your damn self.

841
01:09:52,588 --> 01:09:55,523
I need you to shoot the Horde
when they run out the backdoor.

842
01:09:55,858 --> 01:09:56,483
What?

843
01:09:57,393 --> 01:09:58,257
Wait a sec.

844
01:10:01,830 --> 01:10:02,558
Hello?

845
01:10:09,171 --> 01:10:11,571
Yeah.
No, Everybody, Everything is fine.

846
01:10:15,711 --> 01:10:16,575
Yes sir.

847
01:10:26,689 --> 01:10:27,451
Where are you?

848
01:10:28,224 --> 01:10:31,421
Jail. They're processing me
out right now.

849
01:10:31,961 --> 01:10:35,294
If you run into that fucking coward
Chester tell him I want to talk to him.

850
01:10:36,632 --> 01:10:37,428
What happened?

851
01:10:38,033 --> 01:10:40,194
You want to talk bullshit,
listen to this.

852
01:10:41,136 --> 01:10:44,367
Lexy asked me if I was getting into
the crank making business.

853
01:10:44,773 --> 01:10:46,434
I said you must be fucking crazy.

854
01:10:46,575 --> 01:10:49,703
I'm a business man, just cause
I sell it doesn't mean I make it.

855
01:10:49,845 --> 01:10:51,574
It's a job for niggers and hicks.

856
01:10:51,647 --> 01:10:55,174
Then she said the girls heard
one of your boys set up a lab.

857
01:10:55,417 --> 01:10:57,476
I said "Really"? Where?

858
01:12:26,709 --> 01:12:28,370
So I've been sitting here
for the past 24 hours

859
01:12:28,510 --> 01:12:30,444
answering these stupid questions.

860
01:12:31,947 --> 01:12:32,879
Well, that sucks.

861
01:12:36,385 --> 01:12:38,512
Where's Lexy?
I can't find anybody.

862
01:12:39,355 --> 01:12:41,414
Uh... we're at the house now.

863
01:12:42,825 --> 01:12:44,816
Yeah why don't you
just meet us there?

864
01:12:45,794 --> 01:12:47,728
Yeah ok, bye.

865
01:13:01,510 --> 01:13:02,306
Al?

866
01:13:21,196 --> 01:13:22,288
There's no Horde?

867
01:13:22,931 --> 01:13:26,332
No. Junior lied to us.

868
01:13:26,702 --> 01:13:29,466
That little fucking punk
why would he do that?

869
01:13:32,975 --> 01:13:35,375
He just made all that shit up.
He knew we would take the bait.

870
01:13:35,511 --> 01:13:38,036
And he set us up
so we would fall on our faces.

871
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:37,737
Al. Al. I know
what this looks like alright.

872
01:14:37,873 --> 01:14:39,670
But I tried to stop him.

873
01:14:39,875 --> 01:14:42,639
I tried to stop Rock,
I was trying to save you son.

874
01:14:43,479 --> 01:14:46,312
Alright? I saved you.
Rock was going to kill you.

875
01:14:47,483 --> 01:14:49,610
Why did you tell them
to meet us here?

876
01:14:49,918 --> 01:14:51,146
We have to kill Al.

877
01:14:51,753 --> 01:14:52,515
What?

878
01:14:53,789 --> 01:14:55,381
Don't act like
we don't have to kill him.

879
01:14:55,524 --> 01:14:56,388
We just killed his son

880
01:14:56,525 --> 01:14:58,254
You killed his fucking son.

881
01:14:59,995 --> 01:15:02,896
Oh that's the way
you're going to play me?

882
01:15:03,098 --> 01:15:05,726
After all we've been through together
that's the way you're going to be?

883
01:15:06,068 --> 01:15:08,127
Fine, we might as well part ways.

884
01:15:10,205 --> 01:15:10,830
Part ways?

885
01:15:10,973 --> 01:15:15,603
Yeah, you go clean yourself up
and go do whatever you're gonna do.

886
01:15:15,711 --> 01:15:17,076
I'll take care of Al.

887
01:15:34,563 --> 01:15:36,929
Take my gun mother fucker huh?

888
01:15:39,535 --> 01:15:40,160
Fuck you Eddie,

889
01:15:40,302 --> 01:15:42,293
I got this shotgun pointed
right at your head.

890
01:15:42,471 --> 01:15:43,267
So let's go.

891
01:15:43,772 --> 01:15:45,831
Let's die, right here right now,
you want to die?

892
01:15:46,909 --> 01:15:48,934
Actually, not really.

893
01:15:49,111 --> 01:15:51,409
Why don't we just put
the guns down and walk away?

894
01:15:51,914 --> 01:15:53,279
Put the guns down
and walk away?

895
01:15:53,715 --> 01:15:55,080
Yeah, count of three.

896
01:15:55,584 --> 01:15:57,051
Ok. Bet.

897
01:15:57,219 --> 01:16:00,780
Tell you what, take my twenty-two
out your back pocket first.

898
01:16:03,091 --> 01:16:06,151
Oh yeah. Sure.

899
01:16:09,998 --> 01:16:10,930
Count of three.

900
01:16:12,801 --> 01:16:13,631
One.

901
01:16:19,207 --> 01:16:20,139
Two.

902
01:16:25,647 --> 01:16:26,511
three.

903
01:16:49,338 --> 01:16:50,168
See you around.

904
01:16:50,305 --> 01:16:51,329
Yeah, we'll do lunch.

905
01:17:02,784 --> 01:17:03,546
Fuck You!

906
01:17:03,819 --> 01:17:08,347
Fuck You! Mother Fucker!
Come on let's die mother fucker.

907
01:19:51,686 --> 01:19:53,984
Story checks out.
Found the bodies.

908
01:19:54,656 --> 01:19:55,418
Aw shit.

909
01:19:56,224 --> 01:19:59,284
Eddie this has all been
one big misunderstanding.

910
01:19:59,694 --> 01:20:02,185
I just wish, I wish
I could have stopped him sooner.

911
01:20:02,330 --> 01:20:06,061
This mother fucker went crazy.
He just started killing everybody.

912
01:20:07,402 --> 01:20:08,926
Look at me,
I've been beating on you.

913
01:20:11,573 --> 01:20:12,540
Want a smoke Eddie?

914
01:20:14,376 --> 01:20:15,138
Yeah.

915
01:20:44,439 --> 01:20:45,906
Guess where I found this Eddie?

916
01:20:51,980 --> 01:20:55,108
You know what? Don't guess.
Let me tell you a story.

917
01:20:58,353 --> 01:21:01,220
Now you just told me
all this shit.

918
01:21:01,957 --> 01:21:04,323
But you still haven't
answered the big question.

919
01:21:05,627 --> 01:21:07,094
Whose meth lab was it?

920
01:21:28,783 --> 01:21:30,478
That was your meth lab,
wasn't it Eddie.

921
01:21:31,853 --> 01:21:34,447
You let my son take
the rap for something you did.

922
01:21:35,023 --> 01:21:37,321
They all took the wrap for
something you did.

923
01:21:39,261 --> 01:21:41,456
That makes you
the biggest liar of them all.

924
01:21:43,265 --> 01:21:45,062
All your little bullshit story proves

925
01:21:45,200 --> 01:21:48,135
is that when you torture people,
they lie.

926
01:21:48,970 --> 01:21:49,834
Just like you.

927
01:21:52,674 --> 01:21:54,198
Why don't you just tell me
something I don't know?

928
01:21:59,614 --> 01:22:02,708
Get that smug look off
your fucking face Al.

929
01:22:03,919 --> 01:22:06,615
You lucked up and found my lighter.

930
01:22:08,089 --> 01:22:09,647
You think you know what's going on?

931
01:22:13,028 --> 01:22:14,495
Fuck it I'll come clean.

932
01:22:15,530 --> 01:22:20,991
I don't really give a shit Eddie.
There is no truth, just reality.

933
01:22:21,703 --> 01:22:24,672
I lost interest in the truth
the moment I started beating on you.

934
01:22:26,441 --> 01:22:32,107
The reality is, my boy is dead.

935
01:22:38,153 --> 01:22:39,711
Are you getting ready to cry?

936
01:22:45,527 --> 01:22:52,933
Are you... Hey dog, don't cry for that
motherfucker because, WOW!

937
01:22:54,135 --> 01:22:58,595
Your son went out like a bitch.
I swear to God.

938
01:22:59,607 --> 01:23:00,938
That's your seed?

939
01:23:01,810 --> 01:23:05,371
Al? That's the type of
man you produce.

940
01:23:06,081 --> 01:23:08,549
A man that cries like
a twelve year old girl

941
01:23:08,683 --> 01:23:10,708
that just had her fucking period.

942
01:23:13,722 --> 01:23:14,484
You know what Al,

943
01:23:14,622 --> 01:23:16,385
you can ignore me
as much as you want,

944
01:23:16,891 --> 01:23:19,416
you can act like you don't
give a shit about what I'm saying.

945
01:23:19,661 --> 01:23:20,787
That shit don't matter.

946
01:23:21,429 --> 01:23:26,298
What matters is this Al:
You will remember me.

947
01:23:27,268 --> 01:23:30,726
You will remember me for
the rest of your greasy haired,

948
01:23:30,872 --> 01:23:33,204
guinea, wop, mother fucking life.

949
01:23:33,341 --> 01:23:37,539
Because I am the Moolian
that killed your son.

950
01:23:38,847 --> 01:23:41,179
Die slow mother fucker.

951
01:23:41,816 --> 01:23:43,283
You know what?
You got a big mouth.

952
01:23:44,452 --> 01:23:45,783
That's where I'm going to start first.

953
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:47,148
With your mouth because

954
01:23:47,288 --> 01:23:49,415
I'm getting sick
and tired of hearing your shit.

955
01:23:51,826 --> 01:23:53,259
I want to cut your tongue out.

956
01:23:55,296 --> 01:23:57,730
So you just got to ask yourself
one thing Eddie.

957
01:23:58,299 --> 01:24:03,293
If I'm going to cut your tongue out,
what is it I want to hear from you?

958
01:24:04,639 --> 01:24:08,006
Do your worst.
Do your fucking worst.

959
01:24:10,945 --> 01:24:12,344
You know what I want to
hear from you?

960
01:24:15,950 --> 01:24:17,611
I want to hear you suffer.

961
01:24:18,086 --> 01:24:20,111
Fuck you!
Fuck you mother fucker.

962
01:24:20,255 --> 01:24:24,385
Make it work. Make it work.
Make it work. Do it!

963
01:26:24,386 --> 01:26:25,386
