Yeah, actually I usually go home

609
00:26:06,178 --> 00:26:08,445
but my company's got
a big pitch meeting

610
00:26:08,481 --> 00:26:09,813
so I'm staying in town
this year.

611
00:26:09,815 --> 00:26:14,017

- Uh, Lloyd Industries.

614
00:26:21,894 --> 00:26:23,160
Yeah, it is.

00:26:23,229 --> 00:26:25,929
Blue Skies has had a bit of
a rough go of things lately

616
00:26:25,931 --> 00:26:28,465
and its future affects us all,

617
00:26:28,501 --> 00:26:30,701
so I want to be there
for my boss.

618
00:26:30,736 --> 00:26:32,369
- He took a chance on me.
- Hm?

619

Mm. That's lovely.
It's beautiful.

Are you spending Christmas

Just me and my mom.

623
00:26:43,415 --> 00:26:46,650
My parents divorced
when I was young

624
00:26:46,685 --> 00:26:48,519
and my dad wasn't really
in the picture,

625
00:26:48,587 --> 00:26:51,622
so she's basically raised me
on her own.

626
00:26:51,657 --> 00:26:55,692
Right. So, uh, you grew up
in the states?

627
00:26:55,694 --> 00:26:57,161
Yeah, Chicago.

628
00:26:57,229 --> 00:26:59,930
Ah. That explains
the American accent.

629
00:26:59,965 --> 00:27:04,168
Yes. But my mother is
from Winterstone.

630
00:27:04,203 --> 00:27:06,370
When I was 12, my
grandfather passed away

631
00:27:06,405 --> 00:27:09,706
and he left her his house and
it was in such horrible shape

632
00:27:09,742 --> 00:27:11,341
and we didn't have
the money to fix it up

633
00:27:11,377 --> 00:27:14,211
but it was all that was left
of my mom's family.

634
00:27:14,246 --> 00:27:15,846
My mom wanted
to keep it

635
00:27:15,881 --> 00:27:18,182
so we moved back here

636
00:27:18,217 --> 00:27:21,051
and she's worked really hard to
provide a life for us.

637
00:27:24,623 --> 00:27:25,522

to the house?

Oh. She whipped
that thing into shape.

642
00:27:31,931 --> 00:27:34,398
I mean, when my mom puts
her mind to something,

643
00:27:34,466 --> 00:27:36,133
she gets it done.

644
00:27:36,168 --> 00:27:37,134
Right.

645
00:27:38,704 --> 00:27:40,771
I would love to meet
her sometime.

646
00:27:43,542 --> 00:27:44,708

00:28:09,134 --> 00:28:12,169

661
00:28:33,179 --> 00:28:38,849
- No. You look... Um...
- This is a disaster.

662

I know it's not a date,
but...

Look, you couldn't look bad
if you possibly tried

664
00:28:42,355 --> 00:28:45,222
but if you're not feeling this,
this is easily fixed.

665
00:28:45,258 --> 00:28:48,192
- How?
- I own a store.

666
00:28:48,227 --> 00:28:49,527
And you have my pants.

667
00:28:49,562 --> 00:28:51,696

900
00:39:35,334 --> 00:39:37,468
So much stuff.

901
00:39:39,739 --> 00:39:42,773
- Hi, welcome to the Hope Chest.
- Hello.

902
00:39:43,509 --> 00:39:44,575
Wait.

903
00:39:48,347 --> 00:39:51,382
Mom, didn't you just buy these
for you company Christmas party?

904
00:39:51,417 --> 00:39:53,984
Yes, they were torture.

905
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:55,619
My feet are still recovering.

906
00:39:55,655 --> 00:39:59,356
I almost feel guilty giving them
to someone else.

907
00:39:59,392 --> 00:40:03,193
Speaking of the party,
what did you think of Niles?

908
00:40:03,229 --> 00:40:05,763
- I hear he's single.
- He's not my type.

909
00:40:05,798 --> 00:40:07,998
Why not? I find him charming.

910
00:40:08,034 --> 00:40:09,066
Well, he wasn't
so charming

911
00:40:09,068 --> 00:40:11,335
when he thought I was a server
at the cocoa cart.

912
00:40:11,404 --> 00:40:12,836
And why did he think that?

913
00:40:12,872 --> 00:40:15,706
Well Dorris was having technical
issues with the machine

914
00:40:15,708 --> 00:40:17,708
and I stepped in to help.

915
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:19,476
Of course you did.

916
00:40:19,512 --> 00:40:21,412
But, as it so happens,

917
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:24,949
I did meet someone
at your party.

918
00:40:24,951 --> 00:40:25,816
Oh?

919
00:40:25,885 --> 00:40:27,518
His name is Claude

920
00:40:27,553 --> 00:40:30,454
and we've been seeing each
other for a little while now.

921
00:40:30,523 --> 00:40:32,022
Is it serious?

922
00:40:32,058 --> 00:40:33,557
Maybe?

923
00:40:33,593 --> 00:40:35,392
I'd like to meet him.

924
00:40:35,428 --> 00:40:38,629
Why don't you have him
over to the house for dinner?

925
00:40:38,664 --> 00:40:40,030
Sure.

926
00:40:40,066 --> 00:40:42,866
Um, how about
after the holidays?

927
00:40:42,868 --> 00:40:45,302
I've just, you know I've just
been so busy with the gala.

928
00:40:45,338 --> 00:40:48,038
You're right.
And I have to dash.

929
00:40:48,708 --> 00:40:49,707
Ok.

930
00:40:49,709 --> 00:40:51,108
Thank you so much
for the clothes.

931
00:40:51,143 --> 00:40:52,042
You're welcome.

932
00:40:52,078 --> 00:40:53,544
I love you, Mom.
Thanks.

933
00:40:55,948 --> 00:40:58,983
[phone ringing]

934
00:40:59,018 --> 00:41:01,518
Hey, Karen.
Yes, I'm on my way.

935
00:41:03,589 --> 00:41:04,421
Hey!

936
00:41:05,992 --> 00:41:07,424
You all right?

937
00:41:07,426 --> 00:41:09,460
The color drained from your face
for a second there.

938
00:41:09,495 --> 00:41:12,396
Oh, no, no.
I'm good.

939
00:41:12,431 --> 00:41:13,697
Wow, what do you
got there?

940
00:41:13,733 --> 00:41:16,333
Oh, it's a rescue.

941
00:41:16,402 --> 00:41:18,402
Saw it on the way over.
I couldn't resist.

942
00:41:18,437 --> 00:41:19,503
You're such a sap.

943
00:41:19,572 --> 00:41:22,906
Did you actually buy a Charlie
Brown Christmas tree?

944
00:41:22,908 --> 00:41:24,675
Yes, I did.

945
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:26,543
Does it have a home?

946
00:41:26,579 --> 00:41:29,546
My office. Do you want
to help me decorate it?

947
00:41:29,582 --> 00:41:31,315
How can I say no to that?

948
00:41:33,919 --> 00:41:35,352
Hi.

949
00:41:35,388 --> 00:41:37,054
- How are you doing?
- How are you doing, Claude?

950
00:41:37,556 --> 00:41:42,493
- Right down the stairs here.
- This is so cool.

951
00:41:42,561 --> 00:41:44,428
Welcome to my world.

952
00:41:44,430 --> 00:41:46,063
Well, I share it with Ben
and a couple others but,

953
00:41:46,098 --> 00:41:47,431
you know, they're at lunch.

954
00:41:48,467 --> 00:41:50,434
It is exactly like
I pictured it.

955
00:41:50,469 --> 00:41:55,572
It's arty, groovy, comfy,
just like you.

956
00:41:55,641 --> 00:41:56,740
Comfy?

957
00:41:56,776 --> 00:41:57,908
Are you sure that's
a compliment?

958
00:41:57,910 --> 00:42:00,077
Absolutely.
It means cuddly.

959
00:42:00,112 --> 00:42:01,412
Cuddly?

960
00:42:02,148 --> 00:42:03,514
Then I'll take it.

961
00:42:05,217 --> 00:42:08,852
You don't know how happy
that tree makes me.

962
00:42:08,921 --> 00:42:10,020
Thank you.

963
00:42:10,056 --> 00:42:13,190
You're ridiculously easy
to please, you know that?

964
00:42:13,225 --> 00:42:14,692
How did I get so lucky.

965
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:15,759
I want to congratulate
your mother

966
00:42:15,795 --> 00:42:17,227
on raising such
an awesome girl.

967
00:42:17,263 --> 00:42:19,763
Oh, I'll tell her.

968
00:42:19,799 --> 00:42:20,998
Well, when can
I meet her?

969
00:42:21,033 --> 00:42:23,067
I can tell her myself.

970
00:42:23,102 --> 00:42:25,102
Um, you know what,
I'll, I'll ask her.

971
00:42:25,137 --> 00:42:27,137
How do you turn this on?

972
00:42:27,173 --> 00:42:28,105
Ah!

973
00:42:29,108 --> 00:42:31,175
You don't like talking
about your mother, do you?

974
00:42:32,978 --> 00:42:36,747
- What, you're not close?
- No, no, we're very close.

975
00:42:36,782 --> 00:42:38,682
Well what is it then?

976
00:42:38,718 --> 00:42:41,118
You know, you can
tell me anything.

977
00:42:41,153 --> 00:42:43,620
I want us to be able
to trust each other.

978
00:42:43,656 --> 00:42:44,988
Absolutely.

979
00:42:44,990 --> 00:42:46,156
In my last relationship

980
00:42:46,192 --> 00:42:47,424
I discovered she wasn't
an honest person

981
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:50,627
and I don't really ever want
to go through that again.

982
00:42:50,629 --> 00:42:54,665
Sorry, baggage, but I feel
a connection to you.

983
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:56,233
Me too.

984
00:42:57,870 --> 00:43:02,106
I have been meaning to share
something with you, Claude.

985
00:43:02,108 --> 00:43:04,174
My mother is actually-

986
00:43:04,243 --> 00:43:06,510
Hey, Claude, there you are!

987
00:43:06,512 --> 00:43:07,878
Back from lunch already?

988
00:43:07,913 --> 00:43:10,114
Uh, yes, just a grab and go.

989
00:43:10,149 --> 00:43:11,582
Don, this is Haley.

990
00:43:11,617 --> 00:43:14,718
Haley. I've heard so much
about you.

991
00:43:14,754 --> 00:43:15,652
All good.

992
00:43:15,721 --> 00:43:16,987
Ah, I hope so!

993
00:43:17,022 --> 00:43:18,989
And this is my brilliant boss,
Don.

994
00:43:19,024 --> 00:43:20,624
I'll try and live up to that.

995
00:43:20,659 --> 00:43:22,392
Claude, can I borrow
your brain for a sec?

996
00:43:22,428 --> 00:43:24,828
I was just rethinking the color
of the font.

997
00:43:24,830 --> 00:43:25,996
Yeah, I can pull it
right up.

998
00:43:26,031 --> 00:43:26,630
Great.

999
00:43:26,699 --> 00:43:27,664
Is it ok if Haley sees this?

1000
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:29,666
Of course, I'd love
to get your opinion.

1001
00:43:29,668 --> 00:43:30,667
Uh...

1002
00:43:30,669 --> 00:43:33,036
It's for our presentation
with Leona Lloyd.

1003
00:43:33,072 --> 00:43:34,872
Oh, when is that?

1004
00:43:34,907 --> 00:43:36,073
It's Friday.

1005
00:43:36,108 --> 00:43:37,674
I really shouldn't have
an opinion.

1006
00:43:37,710 --> 00:43:38,842
What are you talking about?

1007
00:43:38,878 --> 00:43:41,779
It's a woman's fragrance.
You're our target audience.

1008
00:43:41,814 --> 00:43:43,747
Ok. Um...

1009
00:43:44,950 --> 00:43:46,717
Well, what do you think?

1010
00:43:46,752 --> 00:43:51,188
It's really nice.
It's clean, it's sleek.

1011
00:43:51,223 --> 00:43:52,823
Too clean?

1012
00:43:53,526 --> 00:43:55,392
I'm just not an authority
on marketing

1013
00:43:55,427 --> 00:43:57,294
and I don't want to say
the wrong thing

1014
00:43:57,363 --> 00:44:00,731
and I know how important this
meeting is to your company

1015
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:03,066
and I should probably
just let you guys

1016
00:44:03,068 --> 00:44:05,302
get back to work and get
out of your hair.

1017
00:44:05,337 --> 00:44:06,670
Oh, you don't have
to do that,

1018
00:44:06,705 --> 00:44:08,105
I mean, Claude and I can
finish this later.

1019
00:44:08,107 --> 00:44:09,306
Yeah.

1020
00:44:09,308 --> 00:44:10,908
You know what, I'm feeling
a little bit light headed, so...

1021
00:44:10,943 --> 00:44:12,242
Are you ok?

1022
00:44:12,278 --> 00:44:13,310
I can get you some water.

1023
00:44:13,345 --> 00:44:14,978
No, I'm fine, I just
didn't sleep very well.

1024
00:44:15,014 --> 00:44:16,547
But I'll let you guys
do your creative thing

1025
00:44:16,549 --> 00:44:18,816
and it was lovely meeting
you Don, but I'm gonna...

1026
00:44:18,884 --> 00:44:19,550
Same here.

1027
00:44:19,552 --> 00:44:20,384
Are you...

1028
00:44:20,419 --> 00:44:22,219
I'm going to go.
I'll see you later.

1029
00:44:35,361 --> 00:44:37,995
I think I've actually made
myself physically nauseous.

1030
00:44:37,997 --> 00:44:39,797
Yeah, this should help.

1031
00:44:43,670 --> 00:44:44,902
What is it?

1032
00:44:45,838 --> 00:44:47,205
Antacid and eggnog.

1033
00:44:49,676 --> 00:44:51,309
Uh, that's an icky combo.

1034
00:44:54,147 --> 00:44:55,813
I think I'm gonna die.

1035
00:44:55,848 --> 00:44:57,982
It's just guilt,
it's not fatal.

1036
00:44:58,051 --> 00:44:59,884
I'm a horrible person.

1037
00:44:59,919 --> 00:45:01,986
How could I have deceived
Claude like this?

1038
00:45:02,055 --> 00:45:03,354
I mean, it all started out
so innocent

1039
00:45:03,389 --> 00:45:06,224
and now it's turned into this
big ugly lie that I can't undo.

1040
00:45:06,292 --> 00:45:07,358
Why not?

1041
00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:08,626
Because he's fallen for
this girl that he thinks I am,

1042
00:45:08,695 --> 00:45:09,727
which I am clearly not.

1043
00:45:09,762 --> 00:45:12,029
Exactly what did you tell him?

1044
00:45:12,065 --> 00:45:14,365
He thinks that I was raised
by a struggling single mother.

1045
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:15,566
Why would he think that?

1046
00:45:15,602 --> 00:45:17,401
Because she was single and
it was a struggle for her.

1047
00:45:17,403 --> 00:45:18,569
Because she was busy building

1048
00:45:18,605 --> 00:45:20,605
a multi-million
dollar corporation?

1049
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:22,473
Yes, which she did
all by herself.

1050
00:45:22,508 --> 00:45:23,674
Mm. Still a stretch.

1051
00:45:23,710 --> 00:45:24,709
Ok, fine.

1052
00:45:24,744 --> 00:45:25,876
But now Claude
and the guys

1053
00:45:25,912 --> 00:45:27,445
they have this big pitch meeting
with her

1054
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:29,146
and when they find out
that I'm her daughter

1055
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:31,182
it's going to go south,
like it always does.

1056
00:45:31,251 --> 00:45:33,251
Ok, you need to let this
presentation happen

1057
00:45:33,286 --> 00:45:37,188
without any interference
then drop the bomb.

1058
00:45:37,257 --> 00:45:38,556
Now, I've got to go
get ready.

1059
00:45:38,558 --> 00:45:39,957
No, don't leave me,
where are you going?

1060
00:45:39,959 --> 00:45:40,758
Out with Ben.

1061
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:41,759
Oh!

1062
00:45:41,794 --> 00:45:42,893
It's just casual.

1063
00:45:42,929 --> 00:45:44,629
Right, can you just make
sure to not.

1064
00:45:45,798 --> 00:45:47,732
Don't worry, I won't
say a word.

1065
00:45:47,767 --> 00:45:49,000
Thank you.

1066
00:45:50,803 --> 00:45:51,902
[sighs]

1067
00:45:52,972 --> 00:45:55,306
I am definitely on
the naughty list.

1068
00:45:58,077 --> 00:46:01,279
♪

1069
00:46:01,314 --> 00:46:04,782
So we've added some vegan
options to the appetizers

1070
00:46:04,851 --> 00:46:06,651
and it fits perfectly
in the budget.

1071
00:46:06,686 --> 00:46:09,086
Wonderful, so that's all set.

1072
00:46:09,122 --> 00:46:12,123
And the committee has landed
some big ticket auction items

1073
00:46:12,158 --> 00:46:15,593
and I've been working on a golf

1193

No, no. I just, I took this
candid shot,

for the picture.

happened today.

1282

I met with a young man in
my office whom as it turns out

1283
00:56:36,395 --> 00:56:39,830
has been dating my daughter
for some time.

1284
00:56:39,865 --> 00:56:44,868

I was her mother.

this anomaly?

1286

Mom, I'm sorry.

Are you ashamed of me?

1288
00:56:55,548 --> 00:56:57,247
No, of course not.

Haley Logan.

So you didn't mislead him?

1294

I didn't do it on purpose.

1295
00:57:11,664 --> 00:57:16,233
It just, it sort of happened and
then I couldn't take it back.

1296
00:57:16,268 --> 00:57:20,637
I know it hasn't been easy
for you, being my daughter.

1297
00:57:20,673 --> 00:57:23,107
But I want you to remember
something,

1298
00:57:23,142 --> 00:57:27,544
when your father left us,
we had to start from scratch.

1299
00:57:27,546 --> 00:57:29,947
I never wanted you to be
in that position,

1300
00:57:29,982 --> 00:57:33,384
to have to rely on someone else
for your livelihood.

1301
00:57:33,419 --> 00:57:37,955
I built this life and
this company for us.

1302
00:57:37,990 --> 00:57:40,758
For our future.

1303
00:57:40,793 --> 00:57:46,063
And it was very tough,
but we persevered, didn't we?

1304
00:57:46,065 --> 00:57:49,933
Mom, you sacrificed so much
for me and I'm truly grateful.

1305
00:57:49,969 --> 00:57:52,236
And when I walk
into that building,

1306
00:57:52,271 --> 00:57:55,372
and see our name
up on that wall,

1307
00:57:55,441 --> 00:57:57,908
I think of what we overcame
to get there.

1308
00:57:57,943 --> 00:57:59,543
And we did it together.

1309
00:57:59,578 --> 00:58:03,580

I am very proud of.

1310
00:58:03,582 --> 00:58:05,048

to elf camp
