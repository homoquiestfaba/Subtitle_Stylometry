00:43:51,759 --> 00:43:54,544
It's a feat for
the record books.
50 years.

868
00:43:57,896 --> 00:43:59,811
My wife kicked me out
after 14.

869
00:44:00,202 --> 00:44:02,248
Ouch.

870
00:44:02,291 --> 00:44:04,946
What did you do
to deserve that?

871
00:44:04,990 --> 00:44:07,253
Probably a number of things,
but the big one was

872
00:44:07,296 --> 00:44:08,950
sleeping with someone else.

873
00:44:11,474 --> 00:44:13,172
Sounds like my nephew.

874
00:44:13,215 --> 00:44:16,175
He made the same mistake.
Twice.

875
00:44:16,218 --> 00:44:20,962
And now he's on his third
till-death-do-us-part.
Let's see...

876
00:44:21,006 --> 00:44:25,053
Two sons and a daughter
from his first marriage.

877
00:44:25,097 --> 00:44:27,534
Two daughters
from his second.

878
00:44:27,577 --> 00:44:29,492
Stepson from his third.

879
00:44:30,842 --> 00:44:32,887
Me, pretty simple.

880
00:44:33,758 --> 00:44:36,282
One wife, two burial plots.

881
00:44:36,325 --> 00:44:38,066
So what do you write?

882
00:44:38,110 --> 00:44:39,807
Children's books.

883
00:44:39,851 --> 00:44:42,592
I was a reporter
and then I quit when
my daughters were born.

884
00:44:42,636 --> 00:44:44,420
I started writing stories
during their nap-time

885
00:44:44,464 --> 00:44:46,335
and it turned into
a second career.

886
00:44:46,379 --> 00:44:48,033
What does your husband do?

887
00:44:49,991 --> 00:44:53,734
My soon-to-be ex-husband
is a sports writer.

888
00:44:53,778 --> 00:44:55,736
Well, that's exciting.

889
00:44:55,780 --> 00:44:58,739
Do you get to go to
the games with him?

890
00:44:58,783 --> 00:45:02,003
Well, it's kind of
a sore point at the moment.

891
00:45:02,961 --> 00:45:04,005
Um...

892
00:45:05,311 --> 00:45:07,487
Matt came back
from a road trip

893
00:45:07,530 --> 00:45:10,142
for one of the Vikings'
away games,

894
00:45:10,185 --> 00:45:12,622
and the dry cleaner presented me
with a business card

895
00:45:12,666 --> 00:45:14,755
that Matt had left
in one of his pockets.

896
00:45:14,799 --> 00:45:16,975
It was from a PR woman
who had traveled with him,

897
00:45:17,018 --> 00:45:21,196
and she had written
a proposition on
the back of the card

898
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:23,329
that wasn't exactly
business-like.

899
00:45:26,941 --> 00:45:28,769
So...

900
00:45:28,813 --> 00:45:31,554
I confronted him with it.

901
00:45:31,598 --> 00:45:34,644
He admitted that
he had cheated on me.

902
00:45:34,688 --> 00:45:36,777
No, never had any children.

903
00:45:36,821 --> 00:45:38,387
Something didn't work.

904
00:45:39,345 --> 00:45:40,607
But...

905
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:44,219
having each other

906
00:45:44,263 --> 00:45:45,960
turned out to be enough.

907
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:49,485
Well, I'm happy for you.

908
00:45:49,529 --> 00:45:52,271
Of course you can't
hitch your cart to someone

909
00:45:52,314 --> 00:45:55,491
without taking
a spin with them.

910
00:45:55,535 --> 00:45:56,754
Yeah.

911
00:45:56,797 --> 00:45:59,582
I wish I knew
your secret.

912
00:45:59,626 --> 00:46:03,761
So, you obviously
have a choice to make.

913
00:46:03,804 --> 00:46:06,285
Well, if your husband spends
a night with another woman,

914
00:46:06,328 --> 00:46:08,591
I doubt that
there's a choice.

915
00:46:10,593 --> 00:46:13,422
Do you still love him?

916
00:46:13,466 --> 00:46:17,557
If love had anything to do
with it, he would have been
alone in that hotel room.

917
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:20,560
[CHUCKLES] Oh, Maddie.

918
00:46:20,603 --> 00:46:23,389
Love has everything
to do with it.

919
00:46:35,705 --> 00:46:37,272
[ALL THREE EXCLAIMING]

920
00:46:37,316 --> 00:46:38,883
Look at this place!

921
00:46:38,926 --> 00:46:40,362
Okay, stay close.

922
00:46:49,371 --> 00:46:50,546
Need some tokens?

923
00:46:51,373 --> 00:46:52,461
Oh, it's you again.

924
00:46:52,505 --> 00:46:54,072
Yeah, it's me again.

925
00:46:54,115 --> 00:46:57,466
I don't exactly spend
a lot of my time in
video arcades.

926
00:46:57,510 --> 00:46:59,120
Really?

927
00:46:59,164 --> 00:47:00,774
We live in video arcades.

928
00:47:00,818 --> 00:47:04,822
Let's play.
Two out of three.
Loser buys a beer.

929
00:47:04,865 --> 00:47:08,129
All right. But I have
to warn you, I always
play to win.

930
00:47:08,173 --> 00:47:10,392
Yeah, I remember that
about your kickball.

931
00:47:10,436 --> 00:47:12,873
Let's try to set a good
example for the kids.

932
00:47:12,917 --> 00:47:15,006
Why?

933
00:47:15,049 --> 00:47:17,443
Hey, you don't still
get violent when
you lose, do you?

934
00:47:17,486 --> 00:47:19,749
I don't know. We'll see.

935
00:47:20,402 --> 00:47:22,274
Yeah. Let's.

936
00:47:22,317 --> 00:47:23,841
Go ahead. Take a shot.

937
00:47:28,497 --> 00:47:30,499
I'm bested.
I can't beat that.

938
00:47:32,458 --> 00:47:36,592
Well, if you and your husband
have been married for 49 years,

939
00:47:36,636 --> 00:47:38,768
he must be doing
something right.

940
00:47:39,857 --> 00:47:41,075
What's your secret?

941
00:47:42,076 --> 00:47:43,686
I don't know.

942
00:47:45,079 --> 00:47:47,081
I have to think
about that.

943
00:47:47,125 --> 00:47:50,041
Oh, he's, uh, funny.

944
00:47:51,781 --> 00:47:57,178
And he's more romantic now
than when we were fist married.

945
00:47:57,222 --> 00:48:01,182
For my 60th birthday,
he covered our entire bed
with rose petals.

946
00:48:02,575 --> 00:48:04,969
Stripped four dozen roses clean.

947
00:48:05,012 --> 00:48:06,144
No!Yes!

948
00:48:06,187 --> 00:48:07,972
That's great!

949
00:48:09,451 --> 00:48:10,583
Matt...

950
00:48:10,626 --> 00:48:12,193
Matt was occasionally romantic.

951
00:48:12,237 --> 00:48:15,370
I mean, you know,
he would send me
French tulips

952
00:48:15,414 --> 00:48:19,070
and sometimes
my favorite
chocolate truffles.

953
00:48:19,113 --> 00:48:20,985
I remember once he...

954
00:48:21,028 --> 00:48:24,249
I came home from work
and he'd installed
a porch swing,

955
00:48:24,292 --> 00:48:28,383
which for Matt was amazing
because he couldn't
hammer a nail.

956
00:48:28,427 --> 00:48:34,433
And we'd, you know,
get the girls in bed at night
and then just sit out there,

957
00:48:34,476 --> 00:48:36,304
talk about our day,

958
00:48:36,348 --> 00:48:37,740
snuggle,

959
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:41,657
watch the stars.

960
00:48:43,268 --> 00:48:44,834
That sounds romantic.

961
00:48:46,445 --> 00:48:47,576
Yeah.

962
00:48:47,620 --> 00:48:50,536
Yeah, we used to
have some good times.

963
00:48:50,579 --> 00:48:54,061
Not even, you know,
doing anything big,
just hanging out,

964
00:48:54,105 --> 00:48:56,542
walking the dog
after dinner.

965
00:48:57,847 --> 00:49:02,374
Sometimes we'd shoot pool,
we had this...

966
00:49:02,417 --> 00:49:06,378
This old pool table
that we kept down
in the basement, and...

967
00:49:13,341 --> 00:49:15,865
I don't know, we just...

968
00:49:18,912 --> 00:49:20,783
We just stopped.

969
00:49:30,358 --> 00:49:32,143
What about you?
Did you ever get married?

970
00:49:32,186 --> 00:49:33,796
Close.

971
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:36,451
Came to my senses
two weeks before
the ceremony.

972
00:49:36,495 --> 00:49:39,063
Of course my mother nearly
had to be hospitalized.

973
00:49:40,325 --> 00:49:41,717
What do I need
a husband for?

974
00:49:41,761 --> 00:49:44,459
I have my own toolbox.

975
00:49:44,503 --> 00:49:47,549
Besides, I don't see much
evidence that marriage works.

976
00:49:47,593 --> 00:49:49,943
Maybe you just haven't
met the right guy yet.

977
00:49:49,987 --> 00:49:52,511
Must be because I'm too busy
meeting the wrong ones.

978
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:56,950
How do all the wrong guys
get to date
the right women?

979
00:49:59,997 --> 00:50:02,912
She hosed down beef
in a packing plant

980
00:50:02,956 --> 00:50:05,393
to put herself
through the university.

981
00:50:05,437 --> 00:50:07,961
She was something.

982
00:50:08,005 --> 00:50:12,444
Wouldn't marry me till
she had that teaching degree
in her hand.

983
00:50:14,359 --> 00:50:17,840
Ah, smartest thing I ever did.

984
00:50:17,884 --> 00:50:20,756
Marrying Ruth Marie Jensen.

985
00:50:21,714 --> 00:50:23,890
You two must have had

986
00:50:23,933 --> 00:50:25,761
quite a romance.

987
00:50:25,805 --> 00:50:28,068
Oh, don't we all?

988
00:50:28,112 --> 00:50:31,028
I mean, isn't that
what gets us married
in the first place?

989
00:50:32,116 --> 00:50:33,769
I guess you're right.

990
00:50:34,509 --> 00:50:36,294
The good, old days.

991
00:50:36,337 --> 00:50:39,253
No quarrels,
no responsibilities,

992
00:50:39,297 --> 00:50:41,212
no problems whatsoever,

993
00:50:42,822 --> 00:50:45,259
before we lost
the romance.

994
00:50:47,305 --> 00:50:49,524
Lost the romance.

995
00:50:49,568 --> 00:50:51,700
It's a bit of a cop-out,
wouldn't you say?

996
00:50:51,744 --> 00:50:57,489
I mean, things get a little
too familiar and maybe
even a little dull.

997
00:50:57,532 --> 00:51:01,232
And then we think,
"We've lost the romance."

998
00:51:02,146 --> 00:51:03,799
But do you wanna know something?

999
00:51:05,062 --> 00:51:07,064
Romance never goes away.

1000
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:12,504
We just stop being romantic.

1001
00:51:16,203 --> 00:51:18,553
Did you marry her for love?

1002
00:51:18,597 --> 00:51:19,598
Of course I did.

1003
00:51:22,209 --> 00:51:25,343
Then fall in love
with her again.

1004
00:51:26,735 --> 00:51:29,347
Romance her, again.

1005
00:51:30,696 --> 00:51:33,351
Give her a reason

1006
00:51:33,394 --> 00:51:36,615
to fall in love
with you again.

1007
00:51:40,314 --> 00:51:42,316
That's the secret.

1008
00:51:48,453 --> 00:51:51,586
Miss, I'll take six.

1009
00:51:57,331 --> 00:51:59,203
Thanks.

1010
00:51:59,246 --> 00:52:04,164
Oh, feels so good to
work off these calories.

1011
00:52:04,208 --> 00:52:07,907
You mean I can't just eat
the pie and let my thighs
inflate like tires?

1012
00:52:07,950 --> 00:52:08,995
No.

1013
00:52:09,517 --> 00:52:10,605
Aw!

1014
00:52:11,563 --> 00:52:12,912
Young love.

1015
00:52:12,955 --> 00:52:15,088
Gets better, you know.

1016
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:16,350
Even the sex.

1017
00:52:16,394 --> 00:52:18,222
Really?

1018
00:52:18,265 --> 00:52:21,442
Well, just because
you grow older doesn't mean
the feelings go away.

1019
00:52:21,486 --> 00:52:23,096
Always wondered about that.

1020
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:25,316
But it's not the kind
of thing you can
ask your grandma.

1021
00:52:25,359 --> 00:52:26,882
Definitely can't ask my mother.

1022
00:52:28,536 --> 00:52:34,716
Oh, marriage, sex,
such a mysterious subject.

1023
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:40,679
Ah, yes, young people think
that old, married folks just
have sex with illicit lovers.

1024
00:52:41,419 --> 00:52:42,898
I know I did.

1025
00:52:42,942 --> 00:52:45,510
What? Thought your parents
didn't have sex?

1026
00:52:45,553 --> 00:52:48,077
Had sex with
an illicit lover.

1027
00:52:50,645 --> 00:52:53,213
It was 35 years ago.

1028
00:52:53,257 --> 00:52:56,085
But I thought you and Earl
were still in love.

1029
00:52:56,608 --> 00:52:57,783
We are.

1030
00:52:57,826 --> 00:52:59,219
We were.

1031
00:52:59,263 --> 00:53:00,699
We just worked
things through.

1032
00:53:03,223 --> 00:53:04,964
My husband was
a firefighter.

1033
00:53:05,007 --> 00:53:07,836
He was working long hours
to make captain.

1034
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:13,233
So I started feeling
a bit resentful,
bit neglected.

1035
00:53:13,277 --> 00:53:17,194
So one morning,
I poured out my troubles
to Mr. Frauer,

1036
00:53:17,237 --> 00:53:19,892
of Biology 10.

1037
00:53:19,935 --> 00:53:24,288
He'd always complimented me
on things that Earl didn't
seem to notice anymore, so...

1038
00:53:25,811 --> 00:53:30,163
Before long, we started
staying after school for,

1039
00:53:30,207 --> 00:53:32,818
shall we say, play dates?

1040

What happened?

1041
00:53:36,822 --> 00:53:39,390
He was a very decent man.

1042
00:53:39,433 --> 00:53:43,872
Veryattractive,
but I loved my husband.

1043
00:53:43,916 --> 00:53:46,353
What I was missing,
I now realize,

1044
00:53:46,397 --> 00:53:49,400
was the romance that
I'd once had with Earl.

1045
00:53:49,443 --> 00:53:52,577
So, I decided to confess.

1046
00:53:52,620 --> 00:53:55,493
I know that sounds cruel

1047
00:53:55,536 --> 00:53:57,234
and maybe I was
just feeling guilty.

1048
00:53:57,277 --> 00:54:00,628
But I didn't know
what else to do, so...

1049

He never said a word.

1050
00:54:03,631 --> 00:54:06,504
He just got up,
he walked into the garage.

1051
00:54:06,547 --> 00:54:10,421
He didn't speak to me again
for three days.

1052
00:54:10,464 --> 00:54:12,945
Later on, he told me
that he cried like a baby.

1053
00:54:13,815 --> 00:54:16,296
And then on the fourth day,

1054
00:54:16,340 --> 00:54:18,733
he showed me
how to save the marriage.

1055
00:54:19,691 --> 00:54:21,345
How?

1056

if you're gonna love

Even though I was the one
who'd done something wrong.

1061
00:54:40,015 --> 00:54:43,715
He said that he knew
that his own behavior had

1062
00:54:43,758 --> 00:54:47,327
a lot to do with it
and he was sorry for

1063
00:54:47,371 --> 00:54:49,155

for granted.

for taking piano lessons.

but we made a deal that
