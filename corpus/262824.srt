00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:37,280
Thanks.

181
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:39,218
AI Green
helps me clear my head.

182
00:04:39,253 --> 00:04:41,847
It's a mental thing.

183
00:04:41,889 --> 00:04:43,083
Yikes.

184
00:04:43,124 --> 00:04:45,285
I hear he's playing at
the Opera House in two weeks.

185
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:47,123
Maybe he's looking
for an opening act.

186
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:48,719
You like the Reverend?

187
00:04:48,763 --> 00:04:51,960
[Laughs] My mom was listening
to Love and Happiness...

188
00:04:51,999 --> 00:04:53,261
when she was in labor with me.

189
00:04:53,301 --> 00:04:57,795
I think he's...
definitely in my soul. Ha ha.

190
00:05:00,608 --> 00:05:02,769
So...

191
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:05,904
what do you do besides approach
strange men on the "L"?

192
00:05:07,315 --> 00:05:09,249
I go to school--grad school.

193
00:05:09,283 --> 00:05:11,274
-What do you study?
-Archeology.

194
00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:12,445
Archeology.

195
00:05:12,486 --> 00:05:13,612
What do you do...

196
00:05:13,654 --> 00:05:15,417
besides serenade
strange people on the "L"?

197
00:05:15,456 --> 00:05:18,983
Oh, wait. Wait, wait.
Let me guess.

198
00:05:19,026 --> 00:05:21,995
You are an ad man.

199
00:05:23,397 --> 00:05:24,887
Now, how did you do that?

200
00:05:24,932 --> 00:05:28,265
It's stitched on your bag.

201
00:05:28,302 --> 00:05:30,293
[Laughs]

202
00:05:32,606 --> 00:05:34,130
Have you done anything
I might've seen?

203
00:05:34,175 --> 00:05:37,736
I don't know. Uh...

204
00:05:37,778 --> 00:05:40,178
I had a hand in the Pop Secret
popcorn campaign.

205
00:05:40,214 --> 00:05:42,182
[Sings]
Butter makes it better, baby

206
00:05:42,216 --> 00:05:45,913
That's it. That's me.
I actually wrote that.

207
00:05:45,953 --> 00:05:48,251
So now when I go to Wrigley
and root for the Cubbies...

208
00:05:48,289 --> 00:05:50,484
I can look up at the big
Pop Secret billboard...

209
00:05:50,524 --> 00:05:51,650
and think of you.

210
00:05:51,692 --> 00:05:54,160
-You're a Cubs fan?
-Heck, yeah. Born and raised.

211
00:05:54,195 --> 00:05:56,891
All right, all right.
Um, so, tell me.

212
00:05:56,931 --> 00:05:59,161
Tell me your best and worst
Cub moment.

213
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,499
-Best--whenever they win.
-Of course.

214
00:06:02,536 --> 00:06:04,868
Worst--game five
in the '84 playoffs.

215
00:06:04,905 --> 00:06:07,669
BOTH: The ground ball
went through Durham's legs.

216
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:10,176
That is the worst moment
of my life.

217
00:06:10,211 --> 00:06:11,803
Horrible.
I was so depressed.

218
00:06:11,846 --> 00:06:13,336
I didn't even go to school
the next day.

219
00:06:13,381 --> 00:06:15,144
I cried.

220
00:06:15,182 --> 00:06:18,481
OK, most guys
wouldn't admit that.

221
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:22,853
Yeah. I don't know why
I just told you that.

222
00:06:29,263 --> 00:06:32,960
DRIVER: Next stop, Adams--
Adams and Wabash.

223
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,297
That's my stop.

224
00:06:34,335 --> 00:06:36,269
[Laughs]

225
00:06:36,303 --> 00:06:37,861
Mine, too.

226
00:06:40,374 --> 00:06:42,069
After you.

227
00:06:42,109 --> 00:06:43,974
Thank you.

228
00:06:46,046 --> 00:06:49,243
So, tell me something that
you would only tell a stranger.

229
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:51,979
Uh...whoo.

230
00:06:52,019 --> 00:06:55,420
I like to make paper airplanes.
My dad's a pilot.

231
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:56,821
Really?

232
00:06:58,392 --> 00:07:01,122
Oh, wait.
Do you have a piece of paper?

233
00:07:01,162 --> 00:07:03,392
Yeah, sure.

234
00:07:03,431 --> 00:07:05,399
What, am I going to get
a little demonstration?

235
00:07:05,433 --> 00:07:08,300
Uh-huh. A little demonstration.
Thank you.

236
00:07:11,505 --> 00:07:12,904
That's very impressive.

237
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:15,408
Thank you.
It's my own design.

238
00:07:15,443 --> 00:07:16,808
Ah.

239
00:07:16,844 --> 00:07:19,369
All right,
this is my favorite spot.

240
00:07:19,413 --> 00:07:22,348
-So, you've done this before?
-Many times.

241
00:07:22,383 --> 00:07:24,715
-You ready?
-I guess.

242
00:07:24,752 --> 00:07:26,549
Here we go.

243
00:07:26,587 --> 00:07:30,353
Strong takeoff. Smooth flight.

244
00:07:30,391 --> 00:07:32,222
Excellent paper airplane.

245
00:07:32,259 --> 00:07:35,524
ABBEY: Thank you.
Oh! Ha ha ha!

246
00:07:35,563 --> 00:07:38,589
KEVIN: But I think your
landing needs a little work.

247
00:07:38,632 --> 00:07:40,463
Yeah, a little.

248
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:41,968
Definitely.

249
00:07:42,002 --> 00:07:43,629
All right, don't think
you're getting off so easy.

250
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:46,367
-It's your turn.
-I don't know. Um...

251
00:07:47,741 --> 00:07:50,471
Let's see. Uhh.

252
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:53,571
OK. You're totally
going to think I'm lame...

253
00:07:53,614 --> 00:07:57,573
but I can name
all the presidents in order.

254
00:07:57,618 --> 00:07:59,609

Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan,

263
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,304
-Wow.
-Ha ha!

264
00:08:22,343 --> 00:08:25,107
OK, I think we're the only
two people in the world...

265
00:08:25,145 --> 00:08:26,772
who can do that
at the same time.

266
00:08:26,814 --> 00:08:29,476
I think you may be right.

267
00:08:29,517 --> 00:08:31,246
[Laughs] OK, that's amazing.

268
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:36,983
Um, I got to catch
the connecting train.

269
00:08:37,024 --> 00:08:40,926
Right. Um...

270
00:08:40,961 --> 00:08:44,192
Well, listen,
it was a pleasure...

271
00:08:47,201 --> 00:08:50,659
commuting with you.

272
00:08:50,704 --> 00:08:52,467
Yeah, it really was.

273
00:08:56,844 --> 00:08:58,471
Well...

274
00:09:01,515 --> 00:09:03,346
bye.

275
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:17,361
Ha ha!

276
00:09:27,207 --> 00:09:29,334
Come on

277
00:09:29,376 --> 00:09:32,072
Love is like a bomb, baby,
come on, get it on

278
00:09:32,112 --> 00:09:35,047
Livin' like a lover
with a radar phone

279
00:09:36,684 --> 00:09:39,710
Hey! To the bone

280
00:09:39,753 --> 00:09:43,211
Rise a little, dance a little,
flash a little light

281
00:09:43,257 --> 00:09:46,818
Television lover, baby,
go all night

282
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:49,420
Take the bottle

283
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:51,658
Shake it up

284
00:09:51,699 --> 00:09:55,032
Break the bubble

285
00:09:55,069 --> 00:09:57,537
Break it up

286
00:09:57,571 --> 00:10:00,870
Pour some sugar on me

287
00:10:00,908 --> 00:10:02,671
Ooh, in the name oflove

288
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:04,337
Yo, man, come on,
tell me what happened.

289
00:10:04,378 --> 00:10:06,005
You're sitting on the train.
She stands up.

290
00:10:06,046 --> 00:10:08,571
Doors open. She's about to
get off, but she stops, right?

291
00:10:08,616 --> 00:10:09,742
Did you say something to her?

292
00:10:09,783 --> 00:10:11,614
I said it was a pleasure
commuting with her.

293
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:13,950
"It was a pleasure
commuting with you?"

294
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:15,421
I'm hot

295
00:10:15,456 --> 00:10:17,356
Oh, that's great.
You couldn't say, like--

296
00:10:17,391 --> 00:10:18,756
[Coughs] From my head

297
00:10:18,792 --> 00:10:21,920
No number, no fingerprints,
no place of business?

298
00:10:21,962 --> 00:10:23,589
OK, fine. I tanked.

299
00:10:23,631 --> 00:10:26,395
-Again?
-Man, you need some help.

300
00:10:26,433 --> 00:10:28,401
Yeah.

-What's up, guys?
-Hey, that was hot, man.

306
00:10:52,393 --> 00:10:53,758
It was great.
It was fantastic.

307
00:10:53,794 --> 00:10:56,763
It stunk. I can't freakin'
believe these guys.

308
00:10:56,797 --> 00:10:58,788
Man, I mean,
the band wasjust awful.

309
00:10:58,832 --> 00:11:01,096
Dude, it wasn't that bad.
Come on, I was in the band.

310
00:11:01,135 --> 00:11:03,330
You.
You should've never--

311
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:04,632
Don't even start this, man.

312
00:11:04,672 --> 00:11:05,832
You should've never
quit the band.

313
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:07,568
Gentlemen,
this is the oldest argument.

314
00:11:07,608 --> 00:11:08,575
It was a high school band.

315
00:11:08,609 --> 00:11:10,474
No, it wasn't.
You know what it was.

316
00:11:10,511 --> 00:11:13,947
Yeah. It was the best
high school band ever!

317

Gimme some! Gimme some!

319
00:11:19,386 --> 00:11:21,684
The chicks were hot, man.
They were great.

320
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:24,987
Yeah. Oh, my gosh.
Is that Brady freakin' Frances?

321
00:11:25,025 --> 00:11:26,652
You didn't know he wrote
a column for the Post?

322
00:11:26,694 --> 00:11:28,821
-No.
-Ooh, that's right. I forgot.

323
00:11:28,862 --> 00:11:30,625
You just skip
right to the Family Circus.

324
00:11:30,664 --> 00:11:32,154
Hey, Family Circus
is a good comic.

325
00:11:32,199 --> 00:11:33,826
It's, like, one square,
and then you're done with it.

326
00:11:33,867 --> 00:11:36,358
-Brady Frances--
-No, Brady Frances--

327
00:11:36,403 --> 00:11:38,337
the guy that Kevin
swooped in on his girl...

328
00:11:38,372 --> 00:11:41,466
back in high school prom time,
you remember?

329
00:11:41,508 --> 00:11:45,137
Oh, my goodness. That was
a freakin' classic, man.

330
00:11:45,179 --> 00:11:46,612
It was a calamity
is what it was.

331
00:11:46,647 --> 00:11:48,114
That's not exactly
what happened.

332
00:11:48,148 --> 00:11:50,275
-Aw, man.
-That was seven years ago.

333
00:11:50,317 --> 00:11:51,682
I got another set, guys,
to do, so...

334
00:11:51,719 --> 00:11:54,279
-Hey, play something good.
-OK.

335
00:11:54,321 --> 00:11:56,653
Hey, look, man, let's face it.
You're twenty-four years old.

336
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:58,453
It's not the first time
you ever choked with a chick.

337
00:11:58,492 --> 00:11:59,823
You know what I'm saying?
You got a problem.

338
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:01,851
Yeah, but this is different.

339
00:12:01,895 --> 00:12:04,887
I mean,
this girl was incredible.

340
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:06,331
Yeah?

341
00:12:06,366 --> 00:12:07,890
You know, it's embarrassing
when everyone knows you...

342
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:09,459
as the guy that always chokes.

343
00:12:09,503 --> 00:12:11,471
Hey, man, come on.
Not everybody knows that.

344
00:12:11,505 --> 00:12:12,631
Two more, please.

Kevin sits silently still

348

In the dead of the day

349
00:12:25,452 --> 00:12:27,181
Huh?

350
00:12:27,221 --> 00:12:30,088
Wonderin'
ifhe finds that girl

351
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:32,422
Thatjust walked away

352

Hmm...

353
00:12:33,761 --> 00:12:37,390

I bet you're wondering why...

Well, yeah, kind of,
but also because...

866
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:07,302
I came up with
this really brilliant idea.

867
00:35:07,346 --> 00:35:10,338
Actually, it's more like
a proposition for you.

Why am I afraid to hear this?

869
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:13,677
I don't know. Me and the guys
were just thinking that...

870

a good idea?

-Hey!

1222
00:07:07,902 --> 00:07:09,597
-Good morning.
-How you doing?

1223
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:12,538
Why so crestfallen, young man?

1224
00:07:12,573 --> 00:07:14,131
I don't want to talk about it.

1225
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:16,871
At this table,
we kiss and we tell.

1226
00:07:16,911 --> 00:07:19,243
Yeah, and then we tell
some more, so come on!

1227
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,407
I think I injured my date.

1228
00:07:21,449 --> 00:07:24,009
Ha ha! Come on, dude!
Don't be so cocky!

1229
00:07:24,052 --> 00:07:25,679
No, I'm serious.
She's jacked up.

1230
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,245
-What is she, a car?
-Isn't that a good thing, dude?

1231
00:07:28,289 --> 00:07:29,722
No.

1232
00:07:29,757 --> 00:07:31,918
-So, what--what's up?
-Yeah?

1233
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:34,689
All right,

Brought her to my apartment.

1237
00:07:40,601 --> 00:07:41,829
And all of a sudden
she points to me...

1238
00:07:41,869 --> 00:07:44,736
and she says to me,
"I want to hear you play...

1239
00:07:44,772 --> 00:07:46,967
one of the songs
that you wrote."

1240
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:48,441
-Ha ha ha!
-Yeah!

1241
00:07:48,476 --> 00:07:50,444
So I thought that was
friggin' great, right?

1242
00:07:50,478 --> 00:07:53,072
So I was like, "Sure!"
So there I am.

RANDY: Oh, yeah!

1248
00:08:04,225 --> 00:08:05,556
That's when it happened.

1249
00:08:05,593 --> 00:08:07,356
-Yes!
-Yes!

1250
00:08:07,395 --> 00:08:08,862

Yo, she got rocked!

1257
00:08:18,606 --> 00:08:20,506
But it's not funny.

1258
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:27,071
Um, so, guys...

1259
00:08:27,115 --> 00:08:30,084
have we decided
what we're gonna do...

1260
00:08:30,118 --> 00:08:33,986
um, you know, if the real girl
actually calls?

1261
00:08:34,021 --> 00:08:36,148
Well, if she hasn't
called by now--

1262
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:37,817
And obviously,
if she does happen to call...

1263
00:08:37,859 --> 00:08:40,589
the right thing to do is
close up shop, end of story.

1264
00:08:40,628 --> 00:08:42,493
Anything else
would be unconscionable.

1265
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:43,929

-She was my 7:30.

1268
00:08:48,302 --> 00:08:50,099
Have you told Kevin about this?

1269
00:08:50,138 --> 00:08:52,197
-Not yet.
-Well, you need to tell him!

1270
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,834
Well, yeah, but
what about our operation, man?

these copies made...

1283
00:09:27,975 --> 00:09:30,341
my whole proposal
turns to crud.

1284
00:09:30,378 --> 00:09:33,370
OK. All right. I can do this.

1285
00:09:34,816 --> 00:09:37,649

-Yep.
-Well, what happened?

You know, it doesn't
surprise me, though.

1306

After all the articles
in the paper...

1307
00:12:00,394 --> 00:12:02,328
but the thing
I don't understand--

1308
00:12:02,363 --> 00:12:04,729
why didn't she call
in the first place?

1310
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:13,399

is already done, so...

listen to your song...

your passion, Kev.

to write this...

1356
00:14:27,808 --> 00:14:29,332
I figure if you could
put yourself on the line...

I can do the same.

all right?

gotta make things right, right?

1393
00:16:30,865 --> 00:16:32,298
-Yeah.
-Exactly.

1394
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:34,267
Good!

1395
00:16:34,301 --> 00:16:35,996
How are we gonna do that?

1396
00:16:41,475 --> 00:16:42,999
I got an idea.

1397
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:44,567
[Crash]

1398
00:16:44,612 --> 00:16:45,738
Whoa!

1399
00:16:45,779 --> 00:16:47,246
Look. I'm gonna
start right here...

1400
00:16:47,281 --> 00:16:48,839
and jump, zip, lock,
I'm gonna ride this.

1401
00:16:48,883 --> 00:16:50,680
Now, Randy, I want you
to start right around the loop.

1402

[Indistinct talking]

1403
00:17:01,328 --> 00:17:04,820
People, we're looking
for the real "L" train girl.

1404
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:08,201
RANDY: Yeah, she's the one.
Here you go.

1405
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:10,203
Wanted--we're looking
for the real train girl.

1406
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:12,034
Have you seen this--
anybody seen this girl?

1407
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:13,699
She's real cute, and, uh...

1408
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:15,538
you seen this girl?
Take that. Thank you.

1409
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:17,441
Take a--take a flier.
Here you go.

Every time I look around

1412
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:23,879
But everywhere you are

1413
00:17:23,918 --> 00:17:27,046
A little short. She's got
pretty hair, beautiful eyes.

1414
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:28,645
Hello. Here you go.

1415
00:17:28,689 --> 00:17:32,022
Beautiful hair, pretty eyes

1416
00:17:32,059 --> 00:17:34,459
Do you know her?
Have you seen this girl?

1417
00:17:34,495 --> 00:17:36,122
I'm trying to find her.

1418
00:17:36,163 --> 00:17:37,494
Have you seen this girl?

Hello, we need some help here.
This is really important.

1422
00:17:43,938 --> 00:17:45,872
We're looking
for this girl, OK?

1423
00:17:45,906 --> 00:17:48,238
Hey! Hey, we need your help,
people!

1424
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:51,972
Hey, has any one of you
ever been in love? Huh?

1425
00:17:52,012 --> 00:17:56,949
Has anyone ever met someone
they thought was their destiny?

1426
00:17:56,984 --> 00:17:59,885
Well, my friend
Kevin Gibbons did.

1427
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:03,378
I wasn't there for him then,
but I am here now.

1428
00:18:03,424 --> 00:18:06,120
Me and my friends, you know,
we took advantage of Kevin...

1429
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,253
and his situation.

1430
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:10,695
-He didn't even know it.
-Yeah.

1431
00:18:10,731 --> 00:18:13,029
We went behind his back.
We messed him over.

1432
00:18:13,067 --> 00:18:14,728
So come on, people...

1433
00:18:14,768 --> 00:18:16,793
take a look at this flier,
please.

1434
00:18:16,837 --> 00:18:18,327
ERIC: And I leave you
with this.

1435
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:23,736
Love may not make
the world go 'round...

1436
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,572
but it's what makes
the ride worthwhile.

I'll be under you

00:19:04,151 --> 00:19:06,619
Hey, Margie,
have you seen Nathan?

1447
00:19:06,653 --> 00:19:08,348
Didn't you hear?

1448
00:19:08,389 --> 00:19:10,118
He had a heart attack
last night...

1449
00:19:10,157 --> 00:19:12,625
right after the Cubbies lost.

1450
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:26,032
Hi, um, I'm looking
for a patient.

1451
00:19:26,073 --> 00:19:27,870
-His name is--

00:19:27,908 --> 00:19:30,206
NATHAN: lfyou think
this food tastes so good...

1453
00:19:30,244 --> 00:19:31,905
then you eat it!

1454
00:19:34,081 --> 00:19:36,641
Uh, never mind.

1455
00:19:36,683 --> 00:19:39,880
So, Eric Young doubles
for an RBl...

1456
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,717
in the top of the ninth.

1457
00:19:41,755 --> 00:19:45,486
Bottom of the ninth,
Wood "K"s the side.

1458
00:19:45,526 --> 00:19:48,495
Set 'em up, sit 'em down.

1459
00:19:52,599 --> 00:19:55,159
You know,
this isn't the first time...

1460
00:19:55,202 --> 00:19:57,670
my Cubbies
have put me through this.

1461
00:19:58,772 --> 00:20:01,639
Ulcer during the '69 playoffs.

1462
00:20:01,675 --> 00:20:04,906
Hypertension
when they lost in '84.

1463
00:20:04,945 --> 00:20:07,641
And you should have seen the way
my hemorrhoids flared up...

1464
00:20:07,681 --> 00:20:09,205
when they went down in '89.

1465
00:20:11,385 --> 00:20:15,344
But that team
also gives me a reason to live.

1466
00:20:17,724 --> 00:20:22,058
So, did it ever work out
between you...

1467
00:20:22,096 --> 00:20:24,587
and that nice girl
from the train?

1468
00:20:24,631 --> 00:20:30,501
I wanted it to, but I don't
think it's gonna happen.

1469
00:20:30,537 --> 00:20:33,836
August 29, 1 989.
My beloved Cubs...

1470
00:20:33,874 --> 00:20:36,672
were down by nine runs
to the Astros in the sixth...

1471
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:38,371
but did they give up?
No, sir.

1472
00:20:38,412 --> 00:20:42,644
They fought tooth and nail,
and they won in extra innings.

1473
00:20:44,651 --> 00:20:48,348
I'll never give up
on my Cubbies.

1474
00:20:48,388 --> 00:20:51,255
Maybe you shouldn't give up
on that girl, either.

1475
00:20:55,529 --> 00:20:58,498
So...

1476
00:20:58,532 --> 00:21:01,433
you gonna tell me
what that's all about?

1477
00:21:07,608 --> 00:21:10,543
Ernie Banks's dinger.

1478
00:21:11,778 --> 00:21:15,339

1479

1480
00:21:33,033 --> 00:21:35,263
Thanks, Nathan.

1481
00:21:35,302 --> 00:21:37,099
Now, you're not gonna
kiss me, are ya?

1482
00:21:37,137 --> 00:21:39,970
Heh!

1483
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:44,376

I know I'm a hard case...

1489
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:19,512
but you're just gonna
have to deal with it...

1490
00:22:19,546 --> 00:22:21,537

1491
00:22:24,885 --> 00:22:26,409
I'm back on the account?

Reebok needs
your talent and passion...

1493
00:22:30,457 --> 00:22:33,949
especially after I told them
that it was your idea.

1494
00:22:39,566 --> 00:22:42,091
I knew there was a soft side
in there somewhere.

1495
00:22:42,135 --> 00:22:45,969
Maybe, but this is strictly
a business decision.

1496
00:22:46,006 --> 00:22:48,600
Sure. I understand.

all over the city.

WOMAN:

1571
00:26:10,444 --> 00:26:12,674

00:26:58,792 --> 00:27:00,384
And when it is the truth,
it is the truth!

1591
00:27:00,427 --> 00:27:01,917
How would you like
to record your new stuff...

1592
00:27:01,962 --> 00:27:03,088

Yeah. Well, Mick's all right,
but I'm more into you, Rod.

1602

[Music starts]

1609
00:27:46,473 --> 00:27:48,498
I get a feeling

1610
00:27:48,542 --> 00:27:51,807
I can't explain

1611
00:27:51,845 --> 00:27:55,440
Whenever your eyes meet mine

1612
00:27:57,017 --> 00:27:59,986
My heart spins in circles

1613
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:05,617
And I lose all space and time

1614
00:28:05,659 --> 00:28:11,325
And now that
we're standing face-to-face

1615

Something tells me

1616
00:28:13,667 --> 00:28:16,659
It's gonna be OK
