1
00:00:45,589 --> 00:00:48,133
Time to smurf some magic.

2
00:00:49,843 --> 00:00:51,553
Let's see.

3
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:54,223
There you are.

4
00:00:54,306 --> 00:00:56,141
Mimosa pollen.

5
00:00:59,436 --> 00:01:02,231
Yes, tiger lily

6
00:01:02,314 --> 00:01:05,651
to make her essence magical and blue.

7
00:01:06,777 --> 00:01:10,322
Unless this spell be all for naught,

8
00:01:10,405 --> 00:01:13,325
the final thing, one hopeful thought.

9
00:01:24,962 --> 00:01:28,423
Once upon a time, in Smurf Village,

10
00:01:28,507 --> 00:01:32,427
happy Smurfs
were going about their happy lives

11
00:01:32,511 --> 00:01:36,598
completely unaware that not too far away,

12
00:01:36,682 --> 00:01:39,768
the evil wizard Gargamel

13
00:01:39,851 --> 00:01:43,522
was concocting a diabolical plan.

14
00:01:44,272 --> 00:01:45,524
Hey.

15
00:01:45,607 --> 00:01:46,942
Hey!

16
00:01:47,025 --> 00:01:49,987
Smooth, you're upstaging the narrator.

17
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:53,281
Yo, take it down a notch,
my blues brothers.

18
00:01:53,365 --> 00:01:55,367
- All right. All right.
- Thank you. Anyway...

19
00:01:55,534 --> 00:01:56,868
So Gargamel said,

20
00:01:57,035 --> 00:02:00,622
"I am making my own irresistible creation,

21
00:02:00,706 --> 00:02:06,211
"the Smurfette, to infiltrate their village
and betray the Smurfs."

22
00:02:21,768 --> 00:02:22,811
Wow.

23
00:02:22,894 --> 00:02:24,312
Not a good look on her.

24
00:02:24,396 --> 00:02:25,981
- She's a Frankensmurf?
- Yes.

25
00:02:26,732 --> 00:02:31,236
And her naughty nature
took Smurf Village by storm.

26
00:02:33,071 --> 00:02:35,615
She even flooded our village.

27
00:02:38,618 --> 00:02:41,079
The Smurfs wanted her gone,

28
00:02:41,163 --> 00:02:46,251
but even though she was Gargamel's
creation, Papa saw the good in her.

29
00:02:46,334 --> 00:02:51,506
With love, kindness, a complete makeover,
and a secret magic formula,

30
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:54,843
he turned her into a true-blue Smurf,

31
00:02:54,926 --> 00:02:59,598
and that is how
our darling Smurfette came to be.

32
00:03:01,433 --> 00:03:03,769
- Hi.
- Holy moly.

33
00:03:03,852 --> 00:03:05,270
Hi, Smurfette.

34
00:03:06,563 --> 00:03:09,608
I wish I had that hair.

35
00:03:13,153 --> 00:03:15,697
- Nice dive, Smurfette.
- That was amazing.

36
00:03:15,781 --> 00:03:16,740
Wow. Show-off.

37
00:03:16,823 --> 00:03:17,866
Pretty!

38
00:03:17,949 --> 00:03:21,286
- That was so purty.
- Nice tuck and roll.

39
00:03:21,369 --> 00:03:23,080
- Hi!
- Like a beautiful mermaid.

40
00:03:23,163 --> 00:03:25,916
Wait, how is her hair still dry?

41
00:03:29,461 --> 00:03:31,379
Oh, no.

42
00:03:31,463 --> 00:03:33,006
What...

43
00:03:34,966 --> 00:03:38,136
Stupid, trusting Smurfs.

44
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:40,013
You're mine now.

45
00:03:40,097 --> 00:03:42,015
- It's alive!
- Smurf for the hills!

46
00:03:42,099 --> 00:03:43,850
Don't kill the narrator!

47
00:03:44,559 --> 00:03:47,979
The world as we know it is over!

48
00:03:48,438 --> 00:03:50,023
She's got a Dragon Wand.

49
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:51,775
Don't hurt my cupcake!

50
00:03:51,858 --> 00:03:52,859
Look out!

51
00:03:56,238 --> 00:03:59,741
Yes! My beautiful creation.

52
00:03:59,825 --> 00:04:03,120
You truly are daddy's little girl.

53
00:04:12,504 --> 00:04:14,089
No...

54
00:04:15,257 --> 00:04:17,843
Smurfette, are you okay?

55
00:04:18,844 --> 00:04:20,220
Oh, Papa.

56
00:04:20,887 --> 00:04:24,432
There, there. Everything's
going to be fine.

57
00:04:24,516 --> 00:04:26,518
Having that nightmare again?

58
00:04:27,018 --> 00:04:29,771
Papa, every year on my birthday,

59
00:04:29,855 --> 00:04:32,858
I have these horrible dreams
about where I come from,

60
00:04:32,941 --> 00:04:37,529
and it makes me wonder who I really am.

61
00:04:37,696 --> 00:04:42,742
And every year, I remind you,
it doesn't matter where you came from.

62
00:04:42,826 --> 00:04:45,662
What matters is who you choose to be.

63
00:04:45,745 --> 00:04:47,539
Really?

64
00:04:48,623 --> 00:04:51,168
Don't take this old Smurf's word for it.

65
00:04:51,251 --> 00:04:53,712
Go out there and see for yourself.

66
00:04:53,795 --> 00:04:56,131
This is where you belong.

67
00:04:56,214 --> 00:04:58,800
You belong to Gargamel.

68
00:04:59,801 --> 00:05:02,387
You belong to Gargamel.

69
00:05:03,054 --> 00:05:06,099
"You belong to Gargamel." Say it.

70
00:05:07,142 --> 00:05:08,768
"You belong to Gargamel."

71
00:05:08,852 --> 00:05:10,145
"I, I."

72
00:05:10,228 --> 00:05:11,229
"I, I."

73
00:05:11,396 --> 00:05:14,316
You know what? Never mind, sir.
You're a dim-witted toad.

74
00:05:14,691 --> 00:05:17,235
"You're a dim-witted toad, sir?"

75
00:05:17,402 --> 00:05:19,404
No, actually, you are!

76
00:05:22,365 --> 00:05:23,867
There.

77
00:05:24,618 --> 00:05:27,204
Yet another groundbreaking feat of illusion

78
00:05:27,287 --> 00:05:31,208
from the most innovative conjurer
the world has ever seen.

79
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:32,709
Gargamania,

80
00:05:32,792 --> 00:05:37,172
the magical sensation that has captivated
the nation from New York to Las Vegas,

81
00:05:37,255 --> 00:05:40,258
is now taking on the City of Light,
Paris, France.

82
00:05:40,425 --> 00:05:44,179
This master mysterio
has gone from unknown to unstoppable

83
00:05:44,262 --> 00:05:46,598
after a surprise discovery in New York.

84
00:05:51,269 --> 00:05:53,355
Yo, get out of the road, freak!

85
00:05:53,438 --> 00:05:56,942
How dare you? How dare you call me "Yo"?

86
00:05:57,025 --> 00:06:00,111
Hey, no, put my car down.

87
00:06:00,195 --> 00:06:02,948
Yo, how do you like it up there?

88
00:06:06,201 --> 00:06:07,410
Moron.

89
00:06:12,582 --> 00:06:16,252
From New York street performer
to the new toast of Europe,

90
00:06:16,336 --> 00:06:20,131
the only magician ever to play
the famed Paris Opera House.

91
00:06:20,215 --> 00:06:21,383
Stay tuned.

92
00:06:24,094 --> 00:06:27,555
Oh, dear gods, can we please
just have one quiet carriage ride

93
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:30,642
without you tormenting me about
using up all the Smurf essence?

94
00:06:30,809 --> 00:06:35,063
I extracted all I could from Papa Smurf
in the kingdom of New York.

95
00:06:35,146 --> 00:06:36,898
How much essence did you extract?

96
00:06:38,483 --> 00:06:39,484
I'm squandering it?

97
00:06:39,651 --> 00:06:40,652
What are you talking about?

98
00:06:40,735 --> 00:06:44,155
I had to turn that man into a giant toad.
It's a magic show, isn't it?

99
00:06:45,657 --> 00:06:47,617
Because without Smurf essence, I can't...

100
00:06:47,701 --> 00:06:50,495
Why am I even discussing this with you?
You don't have any magic!

101
00:06:51,496 --> 00:06:53,832
Stick that on your
Facebook page and lick it.

102
00:06:53,915 --> 00:06:55,500
Like it. Like it. Whatever.

103
00:06:56,835 --> 00:06:57,961
Besides,

104
00:06:58,128 --> 00:07:02,465
I still have plenty enough essence left to
carry out my delightfully diabolical plan.

105
00:07:03,758 --> 00:07:06,720
Now, my adoring public desires me.

106
00:07:07,178 --> 00:07:08,638
Hello!

107
00:07:08,722 --> 00:07:11,933
Hello, my lowly little bootlicks.

108
00:07:12,559 --> 00:07:15,186
Yes, you must all worship me.

109
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:16,271
Yes.

110
00:07:16,438 --> 00:07:19,357
Even you, my flea-bitten little fur bag.

111
00:07:20,817 --> 00:07:25,071
All hail the great and powerful...

112
00:07:25,238 --> 00:07:28,116
Azrael... Azrael... Stop it.

113
00:07:28,658 --> 00:07:30,201
Open it! Open it!

114
00:07:33,371 --> 00:07:35,749
Come, Azrael. Hurry up.

115
00:07:44,924 --> 00:07:46,718
Hello, handsome.

116
00:07:48,053 --> 00:07:49,554
Look, a present.

117
00:07:49,721 --> 00:07:51,973
No doubt from a worshipping admirer.

118
00:07:54,142 --> 00:07:55,143
It's for you.

119
00:07:58,146 --> 00:08:00,815
You are not more popular than I am.

120
00:08:02,817 --> 00:08:04,319
A little green dot?

121
00:08:04,486 --> 00:08:07,697
Why do you get all the little green dots?

122
00:08:07,864 --> 00:08:09,532
Get it, get it.

123
00:08:09,741 --> 00:08:10,992
Father's going to love this.

124
00:08:11,076 --> 00:08:12,077
- Hackus want to play.
- Hey!

125
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,411
Let Hackus play with the kitty.

126
00:08:13,536 --> 00:08:14,746
Cover me.

127
00:08:14,871 --> 00:08:15,872
I'm going in.

128
00:08:16,247 --> 00:08:17,415
Hello, kitty.

129
00:08:18,249 --> 00:08:19,751
Vexy!

130
00:08:20,919 --> 00:08:22,587
All right, my little Naughties.

131
00:08:22,962 --> 00:08:24,047
Yeah!

132
00:08:25,465 --> 00:08:27,092
Hackus to the rescue!

133
00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:29,511
Booyah!

134
00:08:29,677 --> 00:08:31,638
Good save, Hackus.

135
00:08:31,763 --> 00:08:32,847
Pull, pull!

136
00:08:32,931 --> 00:08:35,767
Hackus cat-fishing. Caught a big one.

137
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:38,937
And round 12 goes to the Naughties.

138
00:08:41,231 --> 00:08:43,066
Well said, my dim brother.

139
00:08:43,149 --> 00:08:45,443
Apparently, it wasn't a gift, Azrael.

140
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:46,945
It was a trap.

141
00:08:48,196 --> 00:08:50,657
- Very amusing, my little Naughties.
- Hey!

142
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:51,908
Did we please you, Father?

143
00:08:52,075 --> 00:08:53,993
No, no, you didn't.

144
00:08:55,453 --> 00:08:58,873
You know what would please me, Vexy,
if you were blue like real Smurfs,

145
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,377
then your essence would endow me with real
magic like that of a true-blue Smurf.

146
00:09:02,544 --> 00:09:05,380
That would excite me.

147
00:09:05,463 --> 00:09:08,258
Instead, you're both just
deeply disappointing experiments.

148
00:09:08,424 --> 00:09:09,551
Experiment?

149
00:09:09,634 --> 00:09:12,637
Like my traitorous Smurfette.

150
00:09:12,762 --> 00:09:16,850
The banner goes over there, please.
Thank you, and I love the pinata.

151
00:09:16,933 --> 00:09:19,227
- How's that, Gutsy?
- A little lower, Grouchy.

152
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:21,980
I want to be able to
whack him right in the smurf berries.

153
00:09:22,063 --> 00:09:23,982
Hey, Grouchy. Hey, Gutsy.

154
00:09:24,149 --> 00:09:27,235
What a cake!
Smurfette's gonna love this party!

155
00:09:27,318 --> 00:09:29,946
Hey, who smurfed a bite
out of Smurfette's birthday cake?

156
00:09:30,029 --> 00:09:31,030
- Not me.
- I don't know.

157
00:09:31,114 --> 00:09:33,158
- Greedy?
- What? Why you all looking at me?

158
00:09:33,241 --> 00:09:36,411
Hey, Brainy, here's my present
for Smurfette's surprise party.

159
00:09:36,494 --> 00:09:40,039
Come on, Jokey, do you really think that I,
the smartest Smurf in the village,

160
00:09:40,123 --> 00:09:42,000
- would fall for your sophomoric gag?
- Yep.

161
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:43,835
Just give me the card.

162
00:09:44,961 --> 00:09:47,088
Out-smurfed by a simpleton.

163
00:09:47,172 --> 00:09:50,175
- She's coming. Smurfette's coming.
- Oh, no! The surprise will be ruined.

164
00:09:50,258 --> 00:09:54,262
Code blue! Code blue!
Repeat, this is not a drill. Code blue.

165
00:09:54,345 --> 00:09:55,430
Undo it, unglue it!

166
00:09:55,513 --> 00:09:56,848
We gotta get her out of here!

167
00:09:56,931 --> 00:09:59,058
Here she is! Act natural!

168
00:09:59,225 --> 00:10:00,518
Hey, guys.

169
00:10:00,685 --> 00:10:04,189
Anyone want to do anything fun
on this special day?

170
00:10:04,314 --> 00:10:06,191
Hey, Vanity.

171
00:10:06,274 --> 00:10:08,610
Want to sit by the fountain
and look at your reflection?

172
00:10:08,693 --> 00:10:11,654
Kind of tired of looking
at myself, Smurfette.

173
00:10:11,738 --> 00:10:12,947
As if.

174
00:10:13,031 --> 00:10:14,949
Nope, not building anything for anybody.

175
00:10:15,033 --> 00:10:16,034
- Hey, Party Planner.
- Hey.

176
00:10:16,117 --> 00:10:17,952
- Hey, Social Smurf.
- Yes, darling?

177
00:10:18,036 --> 00:10:21,122
Anything fun coming up
that I should know about?

178
00:10:21,206 --> 00:10:23,458
No, nothing till Smurfapalooza.

179
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:25,877
It's going to be wild, right, Social Smurf?

180
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:30,632
Yeah. I've got it all over the Smurf Web.
It's got 101 likes on Smurf book.

181
00:10:30,715 --> 00:10:32,091
I will put you on the guest list.

182
00:10:32,175 --> 00:10:35,303
So, no one remembered my birthday?

183
00:10:35,428 --> 00:10:37,388
The surprise is gonna be ruined!

184
00:10:37,555 --> 00:10:39,432
Hush up! Hush up!

185
00:10:41,226 --> 00:10:46,314
You know, Smurfette, occasionally,
it's good to have a little alone time.

186
00:10:46,397 --> 00:10:49,817
- Yeah, so take a hike.
- Yeah, we don't need you here, we're good.

187
00:10:49,901 --> 00:10:50,902
- Bye.
- There you go.

188
00:10:50,985 --> 00:10:52,487
See you.

189
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:55,448
We fooled her pretty good,
don't you think, Clueless Smurf?

190
00:10:55,531 --> 00:11:00,161
Yeah!
She's got no idea about the surprise party!

191
00:11:01,537 --> 00:11:02,580
Dude.

192
00:11:05,917 --> 00:11:09,754
Maybe I really don't belong here.

193
00:11:24,227 --> 00:11:26,104
Okay, blow out the candles, Blue.

194
00:11:26,771 --> 00:11:28,773
Nice.

195
00:11:29,691 --> 00:11:32,318
Okay, I think
I've got everyone's issues covered here.

196
00:11:32,402 --> 00:11:37,115
This is an organic, gluten-free,
antioxidant-rich acai berry cake

197
00:11:37,282 --> 00:11:43,037
made locally by a cruelty-free baker
who swears he's never even seen a peanut.

198
00:11:43,121 --> 00:11:44,747
Everybody good? Right?

199
00:11:44,831 --> 00:11:47,625
- Are these plates PCB-free?
- No.

200
00:11:47,709 --> 00:11:52,046
- Actually, we're good.
- Actually, we're good. PCB and BPA-free.

201
00:11:52,213 --> 00:11:53,339
Daddy, can we cut the cake?

202
00:11:53,506 --> 00:11:54,507
- Yeah.
- All right, let's do that.

203
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:55,758
Cut it.

204
00:11:55,842 --> 00:11:58,052
Boy, who thought parenting
could be so complicated?

205
00:11:58,136 --> 00:11:59,387
- Yummy.
- Seriously, guys?

206
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:00,471
You guys make it look easy.

207
00:12:00,638 --> 00:12:02,557
Yeah, you must have had a great role model.

208
00:12:03,641 --> 00:12:04,684
No, not really.

209
00:12:04,809 --> 00:12:08,563
- My dad took off when I was five, so...
- Am I late?

210
00:12:09,522 --> 00:12:10,523
Did I miss all the presents?

211
00:12:11,107 --> 00:12:12,567
Hey!

212
00:12:12,734 --> 00:12:16,362
- Grandpa Vicster!
- Hey!

213
00:12:17,405 --> 00:12:18,448
Happy birthday, Blue.

214
00:12:18,614 --> 00:12:20,783
Now it's a party. Hello.

215
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:22,285
I'm Victor, Patrick's dad.

216
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:25,872
And you must all be his friends,
which makes you my friends.

217
00:12:25,955 --> 00:12:26,956
So let's go.

218
00:12:27,123 --> 00:12:28,708
Arms in the air, you're all getting hugs.

219
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:29,917
Hey, okay.

220
00:12:30,084 --> 00:12:32,503
I thought you said your father left you.

221
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:34,797
He did. This is my stepfather.

222
00:12:34,881 --> 00:12:36,466
You'll want him to leave. Just wait.

223
00:12:36,591 --> 00:12:38,509
Hello. Where's my Gracie?

224
00:12:38,676 --> 00:12:40,511
- Hey.
- Victor.

225
00:12:40,678 --> 00:12:42,055
How are you?

226
00:12:42,138 --> 00:12:43,264
You know, ever since Blue was born,

227
00:12:43,348 --> 00:12:46,934
I kind of miss you being as big as a house
with more of you to hug.

228
00:12:47,018 --> 00:12:48,061
Yep.

229
00:12:48,144 --> 00:12:50,688
And now, I've saved the
biggest hug for last.

230
00:12:50,855 --> 00:12:52,982
- Boundaries, please. Boundaries.
- Let's show them how it's done.

231
00:12:53,149 --> 00:12:54,609
Unhand me.

232
00:12:54,817 --> 00:12:57,278
I don't like this at all.

233
00:12:57,862 --> 00:12:58,988
Thank you.

234
00:12:59,572 --> 00:13:01,824
There's nothing like
the embrace of two proud Doyle men.

235
00:13:01,991 --> 00:13:03,201
I am not a Doyle man.

236
00:13:03,368 --> 00:13:04,369
Little Paddy Doyle.

237
00:13:04,535 --> 00:13:06,829
- Winslow.
- Okay, compromise. Winslow.

238
00:13:06,996 --> 00:13:08,706
Hyphen-Doyle.

239
00:13:09,665 --> 00:13:13,544
Hey, isn't he the guy
from the Korndog commercials on TV?

240
00:13:13,628 --> 00:13:15,713
- Hey, you're right.
- Well, you got me.

241
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,131
- Korndog King.
- No, no, no.

242
00:13:17,215 --> 00:13:18,174
- One moment.
- Please not this.

243
00:13:18,257 --> 00:13:20,718
Now, in honour of Blue's birthday,

244
00:13:20,927 --> 00:13:23,429
I'm going to present each and every
one of you with a free Korndog...

245
00:13:24,055 --> 00:13:25,056
- Thank you.
- ...on the house.

246
00:13:25,223 --> 00:13:27,058
Teriaki dog.

247
00:13:27,225 --> 00:13:28,518
That's for you.

248
00:13:28,684 --> 00:13:30,353
Do these have any peanuts?

249
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:33,022
I would never put peanuts in a Korndog.

250
00:13:33,189 --> 00:13:34,190
Great.

251
00:13:34,357 --> 00:13:35,691
Go ahead, big guy, it's okay.

252
00:13:35,775 --> 00:13:38,694
For the simple reason, you see,
we deep-fry them in peanut oil.

253
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:39,821
Peanut oil?

254
00:13:39,904 --> 00:13:42,615
- What?
- Johnny, spit it... Spit it out right away!

255
00:13:42,782 --> 00:13:44,242
Okay, I got the phone, okay.

256
00:13:44,409 --> 00:13:47,745
Spit it out, Johnny! Spit it out right away!
Into Mama's hands.

257
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:48,913
Deep breath for the EpiPen.

258
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,249
- It's okay.
- What's happening to that kid's lips?

259
00:13:55,586 --> 00:13:58,047
- Azrael, bring me my plan.
- Father?

260
00:13:58,131 --> 00:14:00,174
It's in the bathroom.
Check my side of the sink.

261
00:14:00,258 --> 00:14:01,259
Father?

262
00:14:01,426 --> 00:14:02,969
It's feeding time.

263
00:14:03,052 --> 00:14:04,846
Hackus dizzy.

264
00:14:05,012 --> 00:14:07,014
Yes, I almost forgot.

265
00:14:07,098 --> 00:14:09,434
Apparently, I have to keep you alive.

266
00:14:09,517 --> 00:14:13,855
I hope you both appreciate
what a tremendous burden this is upon me.

267
00:14:13,938 --> 00:14:15,148
All right, mind your manners.

268
00:14:15,314 --> 00:14:16,566
Thank you.

269
00:14:16,649 --> 00:14:20,862
If you were real Smurfs,
I'd be taking essence from you.

270
00:14:21,946 --> 00:14:24,532
I didn't hear a "thank you."

271
00:14:24,699 --> 00:14:26,325
Close enough. Come, come.

272
00:14:26,492 --> 00:14:30,621
We must review my plan
before tonight's raid on Smurf Village.

273
00:14:32,707 --> 00:14:35,751
This is not my writing parchment.
Where is my plan?

274
00:14:36,669 --> 00:14:37,753
"Gone digital"?

275
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,964
I don't understand what that means.

276
00:14:40,047 --> 00:14:43,468
Yes, phase one, "Create Naughties." Yes.

277
00:14:43,634 --> 00:14:45,636
Check. Where is phase two?

278
00:14:50,016 --> 00:14:51,976
I am enamoured of that swiping motion.

279
00:14:52,143 --> 00:14:54,729
Yes, get away, get away,
get away, get away.

280
00:14:54,812 --> 00:14:57,773
Phase three... Swipe.

281
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:59,734
I capture my ungrateful daughter

282
00:14:59,817 --> 00:15:04,030
and force her to tell me the secret formula
that Papa used to turn her blue.

283
00:15:04,113 --> 00:15:05,198
Swipe.

284
00:15:05,364 --> 00:15:07,408
I turn you and hundreds
other like you blue.

285
00:15:07,492 --> 00:15:08,493
Hackus blue!

286
00:15:08,659 --> 00:15:10,495
Hackus blue!

287
00:15:10,661 --> 00:15:14,415
I place you into a terrifying machine
and extract your essence.

288
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:15,541
- What?
- And then,

289
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:19,629
the entire world shall bow before me!

290
00:15:21,047 --> 00:15:23,633
Will that extracting thing hurt?

291
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:26,302
It's excruciatingly painless.

292
00:15:26,385 --> 00:15:28,513
You'll see, it'll be fun, for me.

293
00:15:29,013 --> 00:15:30,598
Anyway, we're getting ahead of ourselves.

294
00:15:30,681 --> 00:15:36,103
Back to phase two, the very reason
we came to this cheese-infested metropolis.

295
00:15:36,187 --> 00:15:39,607
The great iron spire.

296
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:41,275
The only possible way

297
00:15:41,359 --> 00:15:45,863
to harness enough energy to create a portal
right into the heart of Smurf Village.

298
00:15:47,198 --> 00:15:48,616
How I love portal creation.

299
00:15:48,699 --> 00:15:51,786
Come, come, let us away! To the iron spire!

300
00:16:33,869 --> 00:16:35,955
It worked!

301
00:16:36,163 --> 00:16:38,583
Yes! Just enough essence!

302
00:16:47,091 --> 00:16:50,678
And now I will go down in history!

303
00:16:50,761 --> 00:16:53,639
Nothing can stop me now!

304
00:16:58,352 --> 00:17:00,438
My Gargaberries!

305
00:17:02,815 --> 00:17:03,816
Oh, no!

306
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:09,155
Now I shall prove my genius!

307
00:17:12,033 --> 00:17:14,243
Head spin!

308
00:17:19,081 --> 00:17:24,295
It appears I lack sufficient essence
to create a human-size portal.

309
00:17:24,378 --> 00:17:27,590
Father, I can fit through there.
Let me get Smurfette.

310
00:17:27,673 --> 00:17:28,716
Hackus go! Hackus go!

311
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,217
- Hey!
- Hackus go!

312
00:17:30,301 --> 00:17:33,262
Yes, yes. Well, let's see here.

313
00:17:34,013 --> 00:17:37,058
- Eeny, meeny, miny...
- Pick me! Pick me!

314
00:17:37,141 --> 00:17:38,184
Moron.

315
00:17:38,267 --> 00:17:39,226
Yes!

316
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:42,355
- Hey, Hackus, listen to this.
- What?

317
00:17:42,438 --> 00:17:43,648
I win.

318
00:17:43,773 --> 00:17:45,399
Nicely played, Vexy.

319
00:17:45,483 --> 00:17:47,068
Now, I must warn you.

320
00:17:47,151 --> 00:17:49,737
Your destination is a true horror.

321
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:54,325
A realm filled with
the relentless crushing quiet of peace,

322
00:17:54,408 --> 00:17:57,620
punctuated by
the wretched cacophony of joyousness.

323
00:17:57,703 --> 00:17:59,455
- It's horrible.
- What a nightmare.

324
00:17:59,538 --> 00:18:01,916
Yes, yes, it completely ruined your sister.

325
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:04,293
It's such a shame when
a bad girl turns good.

326
00:18:04,377 --> 00:18:05,378
So true.

327
00:18:05,544 --> 00:18:09,006
But she does know the secret formula,

328
00:18:09,173 --> 00:18:12,343
so go get Smurfette!

329
00:18:17,014 --> 00:18:19,100
I just don't get it.

330
00:18:19,183 --> 00:18:22,311
They know how tough my birthday can be,

331
00:18:22,436 --> 00:18:25,272
and they didn't even remember.

332
00:18:25,773 --> 00:18:28,192
Maybe Papa was wrong.

333
00:18:28,275 --> 00:18:31,195
Guess I'll never really be one of them.

334
00:18:36,701 --> 00:18:38,703
- Oh, no!
- Help.

335
00:18:38,869 --> 00:18:41,455
Please, wait.

336
00:18:42,707 --> 00:18:44,041
I escaped.

337
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:45,376
Escaped?

338
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,921
From the evil wizard who made me.

339
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:52,133
Do you mean Gargamel?

340
00:18:52,216 --> 00:18:54,802
Is Gargamel your father?

341
00:18:54,885 --> 00:18:56,345
Yes.

342
00:18:56,512 --> 00:18:59,056
But he's...

343
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:01,934
That means you're just like me.

344
00:19:02,059 --> 00:19:04,186
- Gotcha!
- What are you doing?

345
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:06,230
Father's going to be very happy.

346
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,982
Smurfette's in trouble!

347
00:19:08,065 --> 00:19:09,191
- Crikey!
- Oh, no!

348
00:19:09,275 --> 00:19:11,318
- Come on, Smurfs!
- Smurfette!

349
00:19:11,402 --> 00:19:12,987
No!

350
00:19:14,071 --> 00:19:15,823
- Oh, no, you don't.
- No!

351
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:17,408
- Let go!
- Now get in there!

352
00:19:17,491 --> 00:19:19,034
Oh, no!

353
00:19:19,118 --> 00:19:22,246
- She's being smurf napped.
- Unhand her!

354
00:19:22,413 --> 00:19:25,040
So long, Smurfs.

355
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:27,168
- Smurfette!
- Smurfette!

356
00:19:27,251 --> 00:19:28,377
What are we gonna do now?

357
00:19:28,461 --> 00:19:33,299
My powers of deduction lead me to believe
that this is the work of Gargamel.

358
00:19:37,136 --> 00:19:39,430
Oh, no, oh, no!

359
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:43,100
- Yes!
- Pretty blue.

360
00:19:44,018 --> 00:19:45,519
Gargamel.

361
00:19:45,603 --> 00:19:48,731
Smurfette. Welcome home.

362
00:19:55,154 --> 00:19:57,531
You're wasting your time, Gargamel.

363
00:19:57,615 --> 00:19:59,325
Papa and the others are gonna come for me.

364
00:19:59,408 --> 00:20:02,244
I don't think so.

365
00:20:02,328 --> 00:20:03,871
They came for Clumsy.

366
00:20:03,954 --> 00:20:09,627
Yes, but you see, Clumsy was a real Smurf.

367
00:20:10,961 --> 00:20:13,923
Whereas I was the one who created you.

368
00:20:14,465 --> 00:20:16,550
You do remember that, don't you, dear?

369
00:20:17,343 --> 00:20:21,472
You're not my father. Just let me go home.

370
00:20:21,555 --> 00:20:22,890
Of course.

371
00:20:22,973 --> 00:20:24,266
Anything you say,

372
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:30,397
but first, I will need one itsy-bitsy,
teeny-tiny little thing first.

373
00:20:30,481 --> 00:20:32,525
- Teeny-tiny.
- What?

374
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:38,572
Just the secret formula that Papa
used to turn you into a real Smurf.

375
00:20:38,739 --> 00:20:41,408
Hackus real Smurf. Hackus blue!

376
00:20:41,492 --> 00:20:42,701
Like you, blondie.

377
00:20:42,868 --> 00:20:45,246
It would benefit us both,
don't you see, my dear?

378
00:20:45,329 --> 00:20:48,541
You give me the formula,
I turn my little Naughties blue.

379
00:20:48,749 --> 00:20:50,417
- Blue.
- I use their essence

380
00:20:50,501 --> 00:20:53,629
to continue with
my wonderful magic show here.

381
00:20:53,712 --> 00:20:58,259
That way I never have to bother you
or Smurf Village again.

382
00:20:58,467 --> 00:21:01,345
I don't trust you,
and I'm not telling you anything.

383
00:21:01,512 --> 00:21:06,016
Well,
perhaps you need a little persuasion, eh?

384
00:21:07,101 --> 00:21:08,352
Naughties, attack!

385
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:10,396
With pleasure.

386
00:21:10,479 --> 00:21:11,522
Attack!

387
00:21:11,689 --> 00:21:13,566
- No, no, no, not each other.
- Not me!

388
00:21:13,732 --> 00:21:15,609
I got you...

389
00:21:15,734 --> 00:21:16,944
Hackus!

390
00:21:17,111 --> 00:21:18,654
Kitty, kitty, kitty.

391
00:21:20,531 --> 00:21:22,741
Not the cat, not the...

392
00:21:22,825 --> 00:21:25,744
Deeply, deeply disappointing experiments.

393
00:21:25,995 --> 00:21:27,496
We've got to rescue Smurfette.

394
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:29,081
What's our plan to bring Smurfette home?

395
00:21:29,164 --> 00:21:30,624
All right, Smurfs, listen up.

396
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:35,462
I saved enough grotto water from the last
blue moon for just such an occasion.

397
00:21:35,546 --> 00:21:38,883
I was able to
smurf it into smurfportation crystals.

398
00:21:39,008 --> 00:21:42,052
So you don't need a portal.
Very clever, Papa.

399
00:21:42,219 --> 00:21:43,429
Smurf-xactly.

400
00:21:43,512 --> 00:21:46,515
These will take us directly to
Master Winslow's mushroom.

401
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,852
Yeah, Patrick and Grace helped us
last time we smurfed through the portal.

402
00:21:49,935 --> 00:21:51,812
Precisely! They'll know what to do!

403
00:21:51,937 --> 00:21:52,938
- Sign me up!
- Sign me up.

404
00:21:53,022 --> 00:21:53,981
- At your service, Papa.
- Pick me!

405
00:21:54,064 --> 00:21:55,649
- Did someone say, "Baker should go"?
- I would rather not.

406
00:21:55,733 --> 00:21:56,734
Me, me, pick me, Papa!

407
00:21:56,817 --> 00:22:00,195
Now, now, Smurfs.
I only had water enough for nine crystals.

408
00:22:00,279 --> 00:22:04,575
That's me and three others round trip,
plus Smurfette on the way home.

409
00:22:04,742 --> 00:22:06,702
Assuming you can find her, which you won't.

410
00:22:06,785 --> 00:22:10,414
That's not a very smurfy attitude, Grouchy.

411
00:22:10,497 --> 00:22:12,583
Actually, for me, that was pretty good.

412
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:15,753
I'll need courage,
intelligence and strength.

413
00:22:15,836 --> 00:22:17,129
- So Gutsy.
- Aye.

414
00:22:17,212 --> 00:22:18,339
- Brainy.
- Of course.

415
00:22:18,422 --> 00:22:19,548
- Hefty.
- You got it.

416
00:22:19,757 --> 00:22:21,508
- You'll smurf with me.
- Yeah, can I...

417
00:22:21,592 --> 00:22:23,844
Yes, Passive-Aggressive Smurf?

418
00:22:23,928 --> 00:22:27,765
I think Brainy is a
really excellent choice.

419
00:22:27,848 --> 00:22:28,849
Good luck with that.

420
00:22:29,016 --> 00:22:30,225
You see what he does?

421
00:22:30,309 --> 00:22:32,186
- That's not a compliment.
- Go figure.

422
00:22:32,353 --> 00:22:34,605
- Okay, Hefty, take one.
- Let's do this.

423
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:36,774
- Go get her, guys!
- Oops!

424
00:22:36,857 --> 00:22:37,858
Clumsy.

425
00:22:37,942 --> 00:22:39,193
Somebody do something!

426
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,528
Stand back! I know the Smurflich manoeuvre.

427
00:22:41,862 --> 00:22:42,863
He doesn't look good.

428
00:22:42,947 --> 00:22:44,865
Oh, dear, he's turning blue-er.

429
00:22:44,949 --> 00:22:45,950
Not good.

430
00:22:46,992 --> 00:22:48,911
Somebody get my hammer!

431
00:22:48,994 --> 00:22:50,871
Nice going, Clumsy.

432
00:22:51,872 --> 00:22:54,249
I got it!

433
00:22:54,333 --> 00:22:55,876
Cheerio!

434
00:22:56,043 --> 00:22:58,212
This was supposed to be Hefty!

435
00:22:58,295 --> 00:22:59,713
Sorry! My bad!

436
00:22:59,797 --> 00:23:02,341
I get so puffy when I travel.

437
00:23:02,424 --> 00:23:03,425
Bye.

438
00:23:03,592 --> 00:23:07,262
Well, sometimes,
you got to smurf with the changes.

439
00:23:07,346 --> 00:23:08,430
Travel safe, Papa.

440
00:23:08,555 --> 00:23:11,225
And so Papa and his B team...

441
00:23:11,308 --> 00:23:12,768
I'll be in charge while you're gone!

442
00:23:12,851 --> 00:23:15,062
- And so Papa...
- Go get Smurfette back!

443
00:23:15,145 --> 00:23:17,898
- Come on!
- And bring her home!

444
00:23:20,234 --> 00:23:23,988
I'm glad his throat opened up
and his lips are back to normal.

445
00:23:24,154 --> 00:23:25,823
Again, we're so sorry.

446
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:27,992
If... Hello?

447
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:33,872
Johnny can breathe again, which makes two of
us since both of his parents are lawyers.

448
00:23:33,956 --> 00:23:36,834
Well, that's why they overreacted.

449
00:23:36,917 --> 00:23:38,127
They didn't overreact.

450
00:23:38,293 --> 00:23:39,962
He's dying.

451
00:23:41,213 --> 00:23:43,132
I think it's time for this.

452
00:23:43,215 --> 00:23:46,427
You didn't bring the crown.
Don't put the crown on him.

453
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:48,012
Come on, you used to love this crown.

454
00:23:48,095 --> 00:23:49,471
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

455
00:23:49,638 --> 00:23:51,223
- You wore it everywhere.
- I did not.

456
00:23:51,348 --> 00:23:52,391
Never did. Never once.

457
00:23:53,934 --> 00:23:55,602
This is the way you do it... Look.

458
00:23:56,979 --> 00:23:58,981
Do you see what is going on out there?

459
00:24:00,941 --> 00:24:02,818
Yeah, they're bonding.

460
00:24:04,361 --> 00:24:06,113
- Technically, they're spitting.
- Come on.

461
00:24:06,196 --> 00:24:08,615
Blue needs to know that
family's not just you and me,

462
00:24:08,699 --> 00:24:10,617
and it's really good for him
to play with his grandfather.

463
00:24:10,826 --> 00:24:12,202
Good job!

464
00:24:12,369 --> 00:24:14,997
- Oh, yeah. He's a terrific role model.
- Come on, Patrick.

465
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,540
Grace, he ruins everything.

466
00:24:16,707 --> 00:24:20,294
He shows up, and he ruins things.
That's what he does.

467
00:24:20,878 --> 00:24:23,630
Just like when he first
moved into my house.

468
00:24:23,714 --> 00:24:25,924
He sent my parrot away.

469
00:24:26,008 --> 00:24:27,009
Your parrot?

470
00:24:27,176 --> 00:24:29,178
My father's parrot.

471
00:24:30,095 --> 00:24:35,934
When my dad took off, he left Zeus,
and I loved that bird.

472
00:24:36,143 --> 00:24:40,856
I was a kid, and Zeus
was the only part of my dad I had left.

473
00:24:44,777 --> 00:24:46,070
There you go.

474
00:24:49,448 --> 00:24:50,491
What?

475
00:24:58,373 --> 00:25:00,125
Get Blue. Blue?

476
00:25:01,335 --> 00:25:02,795
Blue?

477
00:25:03,587 --> 00:25:06,256
Blue! Victor!

478
00:25:18,769 --> 00:25:20,187
- Stay there.
- Victor, do you have Blue?

479
00:25:20,395 --> 00:25:21,563
Victor! We can't get the door open!

480
00:25:21,772 --> 00:25:23,023
Victor!

481
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:25,609
- Victor, open the door!
- Victor, we can't open the door!

482
00:25:31,615 --> 00:25:33,617
I can't see! I can't see!

483
00:25:33,784 --> 00:25:37,496
I'm on a dark, lifeless planet
that smells like corn dogs!

484
00:25:39,123 --> 00:25:40,541
Oh, the smurfanity.

485
00:25:44,628 --> 00:25:48,298
Sorry, mister. Your face got in the way.

486
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,969
- Is that Clumsy? Smurfs?
- Clumsy?

487
00:25:52,136 --> 00:25:53,720
- Help!
- Look out, Grouchy!

488
00:25:53,804 --> 00:25:55,430
- Clumsy, is that you?
- This way!

489
00:25:55,639 --> 00:25:57,975
- I'm blind!
- No, you're in a corn dog.

490
00:25:58,142 --> 00:25:59,268
I knew it would end this way!

491
00:26:03,397 --> 00:26:04,606
Where am I?

492
00:26:04,815 --> 00:26:07,651
This place is strange and terrifying

493
00:26:07,818 --> 00:26:10,154
and so handsome.

494
00:26:10,279 --> 00:26:11,989
Hello, you.

495
00:26:14,074 --> 00:26:15,159
- No! '

496
00:26:15,659 --> 00:26:17,494
We're lost in the dark,
and it smells like corn dogs!

497
00:26:17,661 --> 00:26:18,662
Watch out!

498
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:21,456
Master Winslow's gotten old.

499
00:26:21,665 --> 00:26:23,250
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Blue?

500
00:26:23,333 --> 00:26:25,460
Stop, stop, stop. They're friends.

501
00:26:25,627 --> 00:26:26,628
- Friends?
- Yeah.

502
00:26:26,712 --> 00:26:28,672
They're little blue aliens
trying to steal our faces.

503
00:26:28,839 --> 00:26:30,465
No, no, they're called Smurfs.

504
00:26:30,549 --> 00:26:33,802
And they are the sweetest little things
you ever did see.

505
00:26:33,886 --> 00:26:34,887
Not me.

506
00:26:35,053 --> 00:26:37,014
No, not you, Grouchy.

507
00:26:37,097 --> 00:26:38,223
Papa, Clumsy.

508
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:39,808
- Patrick!
- Master Winslow.

509
00:26:39,892 --> 00:26:42,352
- Hi, Grace.
- Smurf, Smurf, Smurf!

510
00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:45,105
- Is that Blue?
- He's huge.

511
00:26:45,314 --> 00:26:47,691
I wouldn't want to be
the stork that brought that guy.

512
00:26:48,483 --> 00:26:53,530
Well, if Blue likes the Smurfs,
then Vicster likes the Smurfs.

513
00:26:53,697 --> 00:26:56,658
What a thrill this must be for all of you.

514
00:26:56,742 --> 00:26:58,493
No pictures, please.

515
00:26:58,577 --> 00:26:59,578
That's Vanity.

516
00:26:59,745 --> 00:27:01,163
Narcissist.

517
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:02,331
What are you guys doing here?

518
00:27:02,456 --> 00:27:03,832
Smurfette's been taken.

519
00:27:03,999 --> 00:27:05,250
- Wait, what?
- Taken? What do you mean "taken"?

520
00:27:05,459 --> 00:27:07,711
Smurf napped by that ghastly Gargamel.

521
00:27:07,794 --> 00:27:10,589
She was off alone
because she thought we forgot her birthday.

522
00:27:10,797 --> 00:27:13,133
There was a misunderstanding.

523
00:27:13,217 --> 00:27:15,844
But if we can find him, we'll find her.

524
00:27:15,928 --> 00:27:17,888
Well, that shouldn't be hard.
He's a big star now.

525
00:27:18,055 --> 00:27:19,890
- He's in Paris.
- I'll call the dog sitter.

526
00:27:20,057 --> 00:27:21,225
You get Blue's passport.

527
00:27:21,391 --> 00:27:24,478
Yes, a rescue mission. I'll come, too.

528
00:27:24,686 --> 00:27:25,729
You need all the help you can get.

529
00:27:25,938 --> 00:27:27,606
Wait a minute, Blue's passport?

530
00:27:27,814 --> 00:27:29,441
We can't just up and go to Paris.

531
00:27:29,608 --> 00:27:31,944
At least, not all of us.

532
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:36,615
Okay, so that's one vote no. Who votes yes?

533
00:27:38,617 --> 00:27:39,868
- Me.
- Of course.

534
00:27:41,328 --> 00:27:43,330
Daddy always loses.

535
00:27:43,497 --> 00:27:46,416
Look, this is my Smurfette
we're talking about. We have to go.

536
00:27:46,875 --> 00:27:50,671
If we're going to be traveling,
let's make sure we do this properly.

537
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:18,949
Okay, here we are. Victor,
can you get Blue?

538
00:28:19,825 --> 00:28:21,285
- All right. We're all clear on the plan, right?
- Yeah.

539
00:28:21,368 --> 00:28:22,452
We'll head over to Gargamel's show

540
00:28:22,536 --> 00:28:24,121
- and see if Smurfette's there.
- Yes.

541
00:28:24,288 --> 00:28:27,124
And I'll go to Gargamel's hotel and see
if I can find out what room he's in.

542
00:28:27,207 --> 00:28:29,668
And, Victor, you and Blue
can just check into the room here.

543
00:28:29,751 --> 00:28:33,088
- Well, actually, I was thinking...
- No. "Actually, I" nothing.

544
00:28:33,297 --> 00:28:34,298
You and Blue, upstairs.

545
00:28:34,464 --> 00:28:35,632
That's the deal. End of story.

546
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:40,012
L'Opera House, s'il vous plait.

547
00:28:41,054 --> 00:28:42,681
My French is tres sexy, non?

548
00:28:42,764 --> 00:28:45,726
- Oui, maybe I'll get you a beret.
- You cannot handle me in a beret.

549
00:28:45,809 --> 00:28:48,729
- Is that what you think? I can't...
- Hey!

550
00:28:48,812 --> 00:28:50,022
Get a shroom.

551
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:53,608
- Good luck.
- You, too.

552
00:28:53,692 --> 00:28:54,943
Okay.

553
00:28:55,986 --> 00:28:59,239
Give him the formula.

554
00:28:59,323 --> 00:29:02,200
Give him the formula.

555
00:29:02,284 --> 00:29:04,703
Give him the formula.

556
00:29:04,786 --> 00:29:07,456
You want to give it to him.

557
00:29:07,539 --> 00:29:09,583
You'll feel better about yourself

558
00:29:09,791 --> 00:29:13,337
if you stop being such an annoying
little brat and give him the formula.

559
00:29:17,674 --> 00:29:20,719
Make her stop. It burns.

560
00:29:20,802 --> 00:29:25,057
Hackus tell you everything I know.

561
00:29:25,349 --> 00:29:27,851
Hackus doesn't know anything.

562
00:29:28,852 --> 00:29:30,854
What? What?

563
00:29:30,937 --> 00:29:32,731
"Buffering"? What the...

564
00:29:34,191 --> 00:29:35,484
My public awaits.

565
00:29:35,567 --> 00:29:39,654
Once again I must go astound
and confound the merry imbeciles.

566
00:29:40,614 --> 00:29:43,658
What do you mean, I'm out of essence?

567
00:29:43,742 --> 00:29:46,036
We can still do the show, all right.

568
00:29:46,745 --> 00:29:51,500
Because we got all the essence we need
right here now, don't we?

569
00:29:52,376 --> 00:29:54,044
I'm going to need a little snip.

570
00:29:54,211 --> 00:29:55,837
Oh, no!

571
00:29:55,962 --> 00:29:58,840
Just going to take a little
off around the ears.

572
00:29:58,924 --> 00:29:59,925
There.

573
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:02,260
When my Papa gets here,
you're gonna be sorry.

574
00:30:02,427 --> 00:30:06,515
Your Papa is not coming
because your real Papa is already here.

575
00:30:06,598 --> 00:30:07,974
- Yeah!
- Now,

576
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:11,520
you can either be a good little girl
and give me the formula,

577
00:30:11,603 --> 00:30:14,981
or you can spend the rest
of your miserable little existence

578
00:30:15,065 --> 00:30:19,319
being harvested
inside my new superpowered Smurfalator!

579
00:30:19,403 --> 00:30:21,321
Your call entirely. Really.

580
00:30:21,446 --> 00:30:22,823
Up to you.

581
00:30:22,989 --> 00:30:24,825
Father! Father!

582
00:30:25,742 --> 00:30:26,952
Yes!

583
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:28,370
Nice work, my dear.

584
00:30:28,453 --> 00:30:31,331
And as for you, nice try.

585
00:30:33,417 --> 00:30:34,418
Yes, Azrael.

586
00:30:34,584 --> 00:30:36,670
You can press the button
on the Smurfalator.

587
00:30:36,753 --> 00:30:37,838
Come, come, come!

588
00:30:38,046 --> 00:30:40,424
We'll brew this hair into Smurf essence!

589
00:30:42,926 --> 00:30:45,971
Papa, please hurry.

590
00:30:46,138 --> 00:30:47,931
I'm so scared.

591
00:30:50,392 --> 00:30:52,352
Poor baby's gonna cry.

592
00:30:52,436 --> 00:30:53,937
Hello, pretty lady.

593
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:56,314
Hackus pretty, too.

594
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:04,990
- Hi.
- Hello.

595
00:31:05,073 --> 00:31:07,451
I was just wondering if you could be
so kind as to tell me what room...

596
00:31:07,659 --> 00:31:09,369
What room Monsieur Gargamel is in?

597
00:31:09,536 --> 00:31:11,621
No. Hotel policy.

598
00:31:18,211 --> 00:31:19,296
Just right over there. Thanks.

599
00:31:19,379 --> 00:31:20,964
Here we are, guys, the Paris Opera House.

600
00:31:22,299 --> 00:31:25,802
- Not too shabby.
- Gargamel's really come up in the world.

601
00:31:27,179 --> 00:31:29,473
I hope Smurfette's here.

602
00:31:29,764 --> 00:31:32,684
I do love a good musical. Guilty!

603
00:31:38,523 --> 00:31:41,109
- What did he just say?
- I have no idea.

604
00:31:57,834 --> 00:31:59,836
Well, wait a minute, wait a minute.

605
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:03,423
I asked for a shroud of mystery.
This is a wisp!

606
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:06,676
Alakazatmosphere!

607
00:32:07,719 --> 00:32:09,179
Holy smurf!

608
00:32:09,387 --> 00:32:12,933
- Where did that come from?
- He's never had this much power before.

609
00:32:26,029 --> 00:32:28,990
Well, I am outraged!

610
00:32:29,199 --> 00:32:30,408
Positively outraged.

611
00:32:30,617 --> 00:32:32,410
I'm sorry, who are you?

612
00:32:32,619 --> 00:32:37,123
I am Monsieur Gargamel's manager,
Madame Doolittle.

613
00:32:37,874 --> 00:32:41,127
What is this outhouse you call a room?

614
00:32:41,378 --> 00:32:43,380
- The Napoleon Suite?
- Napoleon Suite? Yes.

615
00:32:43,463 --> 00:32:45,131
But, Madame,
this is the finest room in all the hotel.

616
00:32:45,298 --> 00:32:46,883
What could possibly...

617
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:50,136
Well, for starters, darling,
it's on the wrong floor.

618
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:52,180
No one wants to be on the...

619
00:32:52,389 --> 00:32:55,976
- The fifth floor.
- Yes. Yes, that's much too low.

620
00:32:56,935 --> 00:32:58,478
Oh, boy.

621
00:33:00,272 --> 00:33:01,314
Good evening! Good evening!

622
00:33:01,398 --> 00:33:02,774
Okay, guys, we're going in.

623
00:33:03,733 --> 00:33:04,943
No, no, no.

624
00:33:08,196 --> 00:33:09,155
Great.

625
00:33:09,239 --> 00:33:11,157
Okay, Papa,
sneak out the back of my sweater

626
00:33:11,324 --> 00:33:13,410
while I talk to this man
who has no idea what I'm saying

627
00:33:13,577 --> 00:33:14,869
and go find that dressing room.

628
00:33:15,078 --> 00:33:19,165
This is a great vacation, guys.
I can feel the stress melting right off me.

629
00:33:19,249 --> 00:33:22,335
- Don't spiral, Grouchy.
- Yeah. We got this.

630
00:33:22,419 --> 00:33:26,089
- Gentlemen, we have a cat problem.
- Get down, get down.

631
00:33:28,008 --> 00:33:29,926
There! No, no, don't be alarmed.

632
00:33:30,093 --> 00:33:32,178
This is how I treat all the critics.

633
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,140
Hurry, up those ropes.

634
00:33:35,223 --> 00:33:37,017
Is Smurfette really worth all this?

635
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:38,435
- I'm just saying.
- Let's go.

636
00:33:38,643 --> 00:33:41,062
- Not permis. Not permis.
- What? This is outrageous.

637
00:33:41,229 --> 00:33:43,148
Your families will all pay dearly.

638
00:33:43,231 --> 00:33:45,859
As a result, some of you may die.

639
00:34:00,915 --> 00:34:02,250
No, I'm sorry, you will need your key card.

640
00:34:02,459 --> 00:34:05,086
Yes, of course, darling, my key card!

641
00:34:06,046 --> 00:34:08,214
Oh, dear, I've left it.

642
00:34:08,673 --> 00:34:13,219
Oui, I was having breakfast at Tiffany's.

643
00:34:15,513 --> 00:34:18,475
I'll just go back and get it.

644
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:29,319
I bet my glutes look great
climbing up this rope.

645
00:34:29,402 --> 00:34:30,904
Grouchy, take a look.

646
00:34:30,987 --> 00:34:32,030
I hate my life.

647
00:34:32,822 --> 00:34:35,283
- Clumsy!
- Move it.

648
00:34:35,367 --> 00:34:37,410
...Interrupt my sorcery,
at least I should be amused.

649
00:34:37,494 --> 00:34:43,083
Now, you will all kindly hail to the great
and exceedingly powerful Gargamel...

650
00:34:43,333 --> 00:34:45,502
What are you doing out here? How dare you?

651
00:34:46,836 --> 00:34:49,464
You smell something suspicious?
Well, of course you do!

652
00:34:49,631 --> 00:34:51,049
I've seen where you put your nose.

653
00:34:51,216 --> 00:34:52,676
Now, get out of here.

654
00:34:52,842 --> 00:34:53,843
Hi, Daddy.

655
00:34:53,968 --> 00:34:56,304
- Blue?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, just listen...

656
00:34:56,388 --> 00:34:58,431
Blue and I decided
we can't let you run solo on this.

657
00:34:58,556 --> 00:34:59,557
We can do this together.

658
00:35:00,558 --> 00:35:03,269
Three generations of proud Doyle men
standing shoulder to shoulder.

659
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,438
Even though we're all
different heights and whatnot.

660
00:35:05,689 --> 00:35:07,774
We are not Doyle men.

661
00:35:07,941 --> 00:35:09,150
Winslow-hyphen-Doyle.

662
00:35:09,234 --> 00:35:12,237
You have a bee in your bonnet
about the whole name thing.

663
00:35:12,404 --> 00:35:13,405
Why do you chortle?

664
00:35:13,488 --> 00:35:16,533
Usually, in magic, the cats are big, no?

665
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:18,785
Like tiger or like lions, you know?

666
00:35:19,035 --> 00:35:22,414
Silence, knave! And allow me to oblige you.

667
00:35:22,497 --> 00:35:24,499
Alakazanimal!

668
00:35:33,383 --> 00:35:35,218
Try not to smell delicious!

669
00:35:35,301 --> 00:35:37,804
So far, this is the worst trip of my life!

670
00:35:38,054 --> 00:35:39,347
And I've only taken two!

671
00:35:39,431 --> 00:35:42,142
- Look! There's Gargamel's dressing room.
- Good eye, Vanity.

672
00:35:42,225 --> 00:35:44,227
Please! He's got a star on his door.

673
00:35:44,394 --> 00:35:45,353
Let's go.

674
00:35:45,437 --> 00:35:47,731
Remind me to put a star
on my mushroom when we get home.

675
00:35:48,732 --> 00:35:50,734
- If we ever want to be blue...
- Blue.

676
00:35:50,817 --> 00:35:52,694
...we've got to come up with
some way to get her talking.

677
00:35:52,777 --> 00:35:54,571
- Yeah.
- Got any ideas?

678
00:35:55,697 --> 00:35:58,032
I got it! Say "please."

679
00:35:58,116 --> 00:36:00,869
Never mind. I forgot you were you.

680
00:36:01,745 --> 00:36:03,705
- All right, here's my plan.
- Okay.

681
00:36:03,788 --> 00:36:06,791
We trick her into
acting like us, being naughty.

682
00:36:06,875 --> 00:36:07,917
Naughty, naughty!

683
00:36:08,001 --> 00:36:10,295
We use all her goodness against her.

684
00:36:10,378 --> 00:36:14,132
Once that happens,
she'll feel like she's part of our family!

685
00:36:14,299 --> 00:36:16,384
Family! I like family!

686
00:36:16,593 --> 00:36:17,927
I love this plan!

687
00:36:18,094 --> 00:36:19,179
- Oh, no!
- Broken family!

688
00:36:20,972 --> 00:36:23,641
- Get her!
- Catch her! Catch Smurfette!

689
00:36:23,725 --> 00:36:25,602
See you later, Smurfigators!

690
00:36:25,769 --> 00:36:28,438
Father's gonna kill us! Go faster!

691
00:36:28,938 --> 00:36:32,192
- Au revoir, trolls!
- Get her!

692
00:36:32,275 --> 00:36:33,234
- Hello?
- Smurfette?

693
00:36:33,318 --> 00:36:34,569
- Where are you?
- Quick question.

694
00:36:34,652 --> 00:36:37,739
How is it we can't reach a doorknob,
but we can get up here?

695
00:36:37,822 --> 00:36:39,032
No, Clumsy, don't! No, no!

696
00:36:46,164 --> 00:36:49,000
You just lost a fight to an empty room.

697
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:51,085
Nobody wants to come up here

698
00:36:51,169 --> 00:36:54,339
and play with the larger kitty
that they so annoyingly asked for!

699
00:36:54,464 --> 00:36:55,465
You have to go! Now!

700
00:36:55,632 --> 00:36:57,592
- Yeah, soon as we get the Smurfette.
- Yeah!

701
00:36:58,134 --> 00:36:59,803
- He coughs up everything he eats.
- You!

702
00:37:00,428 --> 00:37:03,139
Magic man, hand over the Smurfette.

703
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:04,808
What did you just say?

704
00:37:05,016 --> 00:37:06,559
You heard me.

705
00:37:06,643 --> 00:37:08,937
Give me the Smurfette! Now!

706
00:37:09,103 --> 00:37:11,648
How dare you? Alaka...

707
00:37:11,856 --> 00:37:12,941
- Duck!
- ...duck!

708
00:37:14,359 --> 00:37:15,568
Duck?

709
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:21,616
That was... up.

710
00:37:21,741 --> 00:37:23,243
No!

711
00:37:23,326 --> 00:37:24,327
You.

712
00:37:24,536 --> 00:37:27,705
By great Merlin's beard, I remember you!

713
00:37:30,166 --> 00:37:31,668
We meet again, eh?

714
00:37:31,751 --> 00:37:35,171
Daddy's flying! Daddy's flying!

715
00:37:37,549 --> 00:37:40,844
Well, well, well,
it appears we have a volunteer after all!

716
00:37:42,178 --> 00:37:45,056
Enough fooling around, yes?
Open wide, Azrael.

717
00:37:48,309 --> 00:37:50,019
Put him down, Gargafella!

718
00:37:53,231 --> 00:37:54,899
Leave my son alone!

719
00:37:54,983 --> 00:37:57,277
I'll teach you to mess with us Doyle ducks!

720
00:38:09,622 --> 00:38:10,623
You again!

721
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:12,876
What are you doing? Put me down!

722
00:38:13,042 --> 00:38:14,043
Come on, Blue.

723
00:38:14,210 --> 00:38:16,588
Put me down! I could have taken him!
I had him!

724
00:38:18,798 --> 00:38:20,800
I'm afraid that's all the show
we have time for.

725
00:38:21,009 --> 00:38:22,468
Good bye.

726
00:38:22,552 --> 00:38:24,929
Go on, get out, get out, get out.

727
00:38:25,138 --> 00:38:27,181
Smurfette's hair. She's been here.

728
00:38:27,265 --> 00:38:29,183
Look! I found something.

729
00:38:29,267 --> 00:38:31,853
A portrait of perfection.

730
00:38:32,395 --> 00:38:34,647
Imagine how good you'd look
if you were actually helping.

731
00:38:34,731 --> 00:38:36,649
Don't hate the player, hate the game.

732
00:38:36,733 --> 00:38:38,985
- Smurfette?
- Smurfette?

733
00:38:39,068 --> 00:38:40,278
Hey, is that coffee?

734
00:38:41,487 --> 00:38:43,489
Anyone else want a cup o' joe?

735
00:38:44,407 --> 00:38:46,659
Hey, what's that?

736
00:38:46,743 --> 00:38:48,578
It's a mirror, you barbarian.

737
00:38:48,661 --> 00:38:50,455
Snap out of it, Vanity, and push!

738
00:38:52,707 --> 00:38:54,167
Rage before beauty.

739
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:56,753
Whatever this is,
it's making my butt scrunch.

740
00:38:57,378 --> 00:39:00,214
That's a little scary. I mean...

741
00:39:00,423 --> 00:39:02,467
Gargamel!

742
00:39:04,594 --> 00:39:07,722
Clumsy! Are you trying to get us smurfed?

743
00:39:07,805 --> 00:39:10,183
It's some sort of magic window.

744
00:39:10,266 --> 00:39:12,060
Maybe it'll show us where Smurfette is.

745
00:39:13,102 --> 00:39:14,103
Naughties?

746
00:39:14,604 --> 00:39:16,314
- Gargamel!
- Quickly, pick it up.

747
00:39:16,814 --> 00:39:18,900
Quickly, to me, to me!

748
00:39:18,983 --> 00:39:21,361
Smurfette? Hello?

749
00:39:21,569 --> 00:39:23,488
Where did you go? Hello?

750
00:39:23,655 --> 00:39:25,323
- Move, Smurfs.
- Here he comes. Hurry.

751
00:39:25,573 --> 00:39:27,158
- Let's go! Let's go!
- Where are you? Are you here?

752
00:39:27,617 --> 00:39:29,827
- Children? Smurfette?
- Back up, back up.

753
00:39:30,328 --> 00:39:31,621
Close the door! Close the door!

754
00:39:31,704 --> 00:39:33,247
Your papa is back.

755
00:39:33,998 --> 00:39:35,208
Her papa?

756
00:39:35,291 --> 00:39:37,919
If this is a joke,
I assure you I don't find it funny.

757
00:39:38,795 --> 00:39:40,630
- Hello?
- Hold it!

758
00:39:40,838 --> 00:39:44,550
- Are you down there, you little delinquents?
- Keep still.

759
00:39:44,634 --> 00:39:46,636
They must have retreated back to the hotel.

760
00:39:50,264 --> 00:39:52,058
Of course we're running out of time.

761
00:39:52,141 --> 00:39:55,937
If that Patrick person is here,
then Papa cannot be far behind.

762
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:59,023
Quickly, to the hotel!
We must get to her before he does.

763
00:40:03,486 --> 00:40:04,946
My face! My face!

764
00:40:05,029 --> 00:40:07,407
- What?
- It's gorgeous.

765
00:40:08,074 --> 00:40:10,952
We fell, and it wasn't even my fault!

766
00:40:11,411 --> 00:40:13,162
Anyone? Anyone?

767
00:40:13,246 --> 00:40:17,083
Oh, my Smurf.

768
00:40:20,878 --> 00:40:22,964
I'm scrunching again.

769
00:40:23,798 --> 00:40:27,343
Papa, what does this
have to do with Smurfette?

770
00:40:27,427 --> 00:40:29,929
Everything, I'm afraid.

771
00:40:30,013 --> 00:40:33,141
Why would he build such a hideous device?

772
00:40:33,224 --> 00:40:35,768
Is that a giant Smurfalator?

773
00:40:35,852 --> 00:40:37,687
To extract our essence.

774
00:40:38,396 --> 00:40:41,566
What are all those containers for?

775
00:40:41,649 --> 00:40:44,986
Ninety-nine bottles of Smurf on the wall.

776
00:40:45,069 --> 00:40:47,905
So if Smurfette gives him the formula...

777
00:40:47,989 --> 00:40:53,286
He can turn as many Naughties into Smurfs
as his greedy heart desires.

778
00:40:53,369 --> 00:40:55,038
Guys?

779
00:41:03,463 --> 00:41:04,547
Oh, dear.

780
00:41:06,758 --> 00:41:08,384
Need a catch, please.

781
00:41:12,096 --> 00:41:14,390
This place really needs to recycle.

782
00:41:14,807 --> 00:41:16,976
Think, Smurfette, think. Oh, no!

783
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:19,228
- Where's Smurfette? Where's Smurfette?
- There she is!

784
00:41:19,312 --> 00:41:21,647
She's fast! I love this game!

785
00:41:21,731 --> 00:41:25,318
Wait! Let's let her run for a bit.
She's got nowhere to go.

786
00:41:25,401 --> 00:41:27,445
- This is perfect for my plan!
- Yeah, yeah.

787
00:41:27,653 --> 00:41:30,239
What are you so cross about? I'm the duck!

788
00:41:30,406 --> 00:41:33,493
You always barge in and ruin everything!
You're like a walking disaster!

789
00:41:33,576 --> 00:41:35,244
Hey, look me in the eyes and say that.

790
00:41:35,453 --> 00:41:38,748
- I can't.
- That's right, because it's not true.

791
00:41:39,248 --> 00:41:41,542
No, I can't because your eyes
are on the sides of your head!

792
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:45,379
All the better for me
to see your disrespect!

793
00:41:46,422 --> 00:41:48,341
- What are you looking at?
- Hurry up.

794
00:41:48,424 --> 00:41:50,301
It's global warming. Buy a Prius.

795
00:41:51,427 --> 00:41:53,679
Okay. Did I lose them?

796
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:58,810
Good dog.

797
00:41:59,519 --> 00:42:02,271
No, no... Sorry. Excuse me.

798
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:05,691
Okay, I got this.

799
00:42:16,285 --> 00:42:19,664
Papa, where are you?

800
00:42:20,414 --> 00:42:24,127
Why am I not surprised the way out of
Gargamel's lair is through a sewer?

801
00:42:24,210 --> 00:42:25,795
- Master Winslow.
- Papa!

802
00:42:25,878 --> 00:42:27,630
- Patrick, look.
- What happened?

803
00:42:27,797 --> 00:42:30,967
Gargamel is hatching a
terrible, terrible plan.

804
00:42:32,176 --> 00:42:33,594
What's with the duck?

805
00:42:33,803 --> 00:42:35,847
That's Victor.
Gargamel turned him into a duck.

806
00:42:36,097 --> 00:42:39,100
- Now Gargamel knows we're onto him.
- I was only trying to help!

807
00:42:39,308 --> 00:42:41,144
Victor, you look fowl.

808
00:42:41,769 --> 00:42:44,063
Yes, I did. Yes, I did.

809
00:42:44,313 --> 00:42:47,567
Focus, everyone.
We've got to find Smurfette quickly.

810
00:42:48,234 --> 00:42:51,404
- There she is! Got her!
- Chase over?

811
00:42:52,196 --> 00:42:54,740
Hey, Hackus. See that candy store?

812
00:42:54,824 --> 00:42:57,076
- Candy? Candy!
- I've got an idea.

813
00:42:57,326 --> 00:43:00,746
Go get yourself in trouble. Be naughty!
I'll take care of the rest.

814
00:43:00,830 --> 00:43:03,833
I love to make trouble!
Naughty, naughty, naughty!

815
00:43:05,793 --> 00:43:08,045
Hey, blondie. Where you going?

816
00:43:08,254 --> 00:43:09,589
Leave me alone.

817
00:43:09,672 --> 00:43:12,175
You mean like your so-called Papa has?

818
00:43:12,675 --> 00:43:14,218
No, he hasn't!

819
00:43:15,386 --> 00:43:17,180
He will come for me.

820
00:43:18,055 --> 00:43:23,060
He won't, because he knows
you're where you really belong.

821
00:43:23,769 --> 00:43:25,396
I didn't kidnap you, Smurfette.

822
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:27,648
I brought you home.

823
00:43:29,984 --> 00:43:32,320
I'm gonna make big trouble.

824
00:43:38,326 --> 00:43:40,453
Yummy candy!

825
00:43:48,544 --> 00:43:49,587
Here comes trouble!

826
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:54,300
Hello!

827
00:44:04,727 --> 00:44:08,522
Oh, my gosh!
He's gonna be killed! We have to help!

828
00:44:10,024 --> 00:44:11,651
I thought you were supposed to be good.

829
00:44:11,859 --> 00:44:13,152
But...

830
00:44:13,611 --> 00:44:14,987
Help!

831
00:44:15,196 --> 00:44:16,530
Oh, smurf.

832
00:44:16,614 --> 00:44:18,074
Okay, come on!

833
00:44:18,407 --> 00:44:21,494
Oh, no. I'm really in trouble now.

834
00:44:21,744 --> 00:44:23,955
- Vexy!
- Oh, no! Hackus!

835
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:25,206
Help!

836
00:44:25,331 --> 00:44:26,749
Help Hackus.

837
00:44:28,417 --> 00:44:30,544
Smurfette, what are we gonna do?

838
00:44:31,087 --> 00:44:33,089
Vexy, give me a lift! Come on, jump!

839
00:44:36,092 --> 00:44:38,261
- Bull's-eye!
- Holy smurf!

840
00:44:38,427 --> 00:44:41,514
- Good one, Smurfette!
- Blend that, candy man!

841
00:44:41,764 --> 00:44:42,807
Come on, Hackus!

842
00:44:44,558 --> 00:44:46,727
Vexy, let's go!

843
00:44:50,606 --> 00:44:51,774
Hold on!

844
00:44:52,024 --> 00:44:53,567
Look out!

845
00:44:53,776 --> 00:44:55,653
Nice move, stealing a cart.

846
00:44:55,861 --> 00:44:57,989
I didn't exactly steal it.

847
00:44:58,698 --> 00:45:00,616
- Sorry!
- Well, it's not yours, is it?

848
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:01,951
Naughty, naughty, naughty.

849
00:45:02,034 --> 00:45:04,120
See? You're just like us.

850
00:45:05,621 --> 00:45:09,875
How am I going to get Smurfette
to give me that formula, Azrael?

851
00:45:09,959 --> 00:45:12,128
This whole thing just makes me want to...

852
00:45:12,837 --> 00:45:15,172
Cry? No. Flush her down the toilet bowl.

853
00:45:15,256 --> 00:45:16,841
There must be something we can do.

854
00:45:16,924 --> 00:45:20,636
I know you only have a tiny little
pea-sized brain in there, but think!

855
00:45:21,804 --> 00:45:24,181
Is it her birthday? Really? Who cares?

856
00:45:25,933 --> 00:45:28,269
A present? A cake?

857
00:45:28,352 --> 00:45:29,395
Be nice to her?

858
00:45:32,690 --> 00:45:37,320
Bribery and flattery
to soften her stony little heart, eh?

859
00:45:37,403 --> 00:45:40,448
That's counterintuitive,
but that just might work.

860
00:45:41,157 --> 00:45:43,200
I'm so glad I thought of this!

861
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:45,619
Let's see...

862
00:45:46,370 --> 00:45:47,371
All right, all right.

863
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:49,081
What kind of gift should I get her?

864
00:45:49,248 --> 00:45:51,334
- Kitty, kitty, kitty!
- Hey, fish breath!

865
00:45:53,502 --> 00:45:55,546
Not now, Azrael, I'm trying to think of

866
00:45:55,629 --> 00:45:58,924
a genuine and heartfelt gift
that I can deceive that Smurfette with!

867
00:45:59,008 --> 00:46:00,343
I said not now!

868
00:46:01,510 --> 00:46:05,056
Not now! Not now! Not now!
Not now! Not now! Not now!

869
00:46:06,349 --> 00:46:07,850
You are walking home.

870
00:46:09,352 --> 00:46:10,353
Cats.

871
00:46:12,355 --> 00:46:13,522
Faster! Faster!

872
00:46:13,647 --> 00:46:14,607
Excuse us! Sorry!

873
00:46:14,690 --> 00:46:16,192
How are we gonna stop this thing?

874
00:46:16,650 --> 00:46:18,694
I don't think that's gonna be a problem!

875
00:46:19,612 --> 00:46:21,697
And she sticks the landing!

876
00:46:25,242 --> 00:46:28,329
- Yummy pudding!
- Hackus, it's mud.

877
00:46:28,412 --> 00:46:30,039
Yummy mud!

878
00:46:33,334 --> 00:46:35,252
Take your best shot, cat!

879
00:46:36,003 --> 00:46:37,046
Watch out!

880
00:46:40,424 --> 00:46:41,425
Yes!

881
00:46:41,592 --> 00:46:43,552
- Nice shot! Let's go!
- Nice shot! Let's go!

882
00:46:44,095 --> 00:46:45,971
- Come on!
- Move it or lose it, Hackus!

883
00:46:46,055 --> 00:46:49,225
Oh, no! Angry kitty! Angry kitty! Run!

884
00:46:49,683 --> 00:46:51,560
Okay, ladies, act pregnant.

885
00:46:51,685 --> 00:46:52,853
- This way, guys!
- Faster!

886
00:46:52,937 --> 00:46:54,730
- It's time to get your wings!
- Faster!

887
00:46:54,814 --> 00:46:56,065
Quick, get on the storks!

888
00:46:56,232 --> 00:46:57,358
Let's go!

889
00:46:57,441 --> 00:46:58,442
Wait, where's Hackus?

890
00:46:59,443 --> 00:47:00,945
Fly, big stork, fly!

891
00:47:01,445 --> 00:47:03,823
Here comes kitty! Look out!

892
00:47:04,448 --> 00:47:06,409
Come on, Hackus! Let's go!

893
00:47:08,869 --> 00:47:10,204
Yeah!

894
00:47:10,746 --> 00:47:13,040
Hey, look, it's a catfish!

895
00:47:13,124 --> 00:47:15,292
Bye, kitty!

896
00:47:16,252 --> 00:47:18,504
This is amazing!

897
00:47:19,004 --> 00:47:22,174
Stork going backwards!
Stork going backwards!

898
00:47:26,137 --> 00:47:28,931
This is so beautiful!

899
00:47:30,433 --> 00:47:32,351
I'm falling! I'm falling!

900
00:47:33,936 --> 00:47:36,021
Smurfette's my hero!

901
00:47:37,857 --> 00:47:39,567
- How did it go?
- Couldn't have gone better.

902
00:47:39,650 --> 00:47:42,278
Except that everything
was a complete smurftastrophe.

903
00:47:43,112 --> 00:47:44,488
It's Smurfy's Law.

904
00:47:44,572 --> 00:47:46,824
Well, I have some good news.

905
00:47:46,907 --> 00:47:52,413
I borrowed a waiter's outfit for you, complete
with a security card for the elevator.

906
00:47:52,621 --> 00:47:53,622
How did you manage that?

907
00:47:53,956 --> 00:47:57,084
Let's just say that the Plaza Athénée
laundry room was paid a little visit

908
00:47:57,251 --> 00:48:01,213
by international apparel
inspector Mademoiselle Doolittle.

909
00:48:01,297 --> 00:48:03,174
I was like Meryl smurfin' Streep.

910
00:48:04,133 --> 00:48:05,759
Good job, Grace!

911
00:48:05,885 --> 00:48:08,345
Does everyone get a new outfit,
or just Patrick?

912
00:48:09,472 --> 00:48:11,098
- Bloody window.
- What was that?

913
00:48:11,265 --> 00:48:12,224
That's Victor.

914
00:48:12,308 --> 00:48:15,728
They wouldn't let him through the lobby,
so he flew up.

915
00:48:16,937 --> 00:48:18,814
No depth perception.

916
00:48:18,981 --> 00:48:20,816
Grandpa Vicster is a duck!

917
00:48:21,150 --> 00:48:22,318
Gargamel zapped him.

918
00:48:22,776 --> 00:48:23,819
You can change him back, right?

919
00:48:24,361 --> 00:48:26,530
No, but it's a transformation spell.

920
00:48:26,739 --> 00:48:28,157
It'll wear off eventually.

921
00:48:28,324 --> 00:48:30,576
Everybody relax. It's not a problem.

922
00:48:30,659 --> 00:48:33,162
But if you see me lay an egg,
it's just between us.

923
00:48:35,122 --> 00:48:36,832
You don't seem too upset about this.

924
00:48:36,999 --> 00:48:39,210
It's not in a duck's nature to get upset.

925
00:48:39,293 --> 00:48:41,879
We like to let things roll off our backs.

926
00:48:42,046 --> 00:48:44,256
Seriously? You seriously just said that?

927
00:48:44,423 --> 00:48:47,176
- I like that. That's very smurfy of you.
- Very smurfy.

928
00:48:47,259 --> 00:48:48,552
Why, thank you. See?

929
00:48:48,761 --> 00:48:50,763
The little Santa Claus
Smurf appreciates me.

930
00:48:50,846 --> 00:48:54,725
Maybe someday, Patrick, you'll learn to
appreciate my smurfy qualities, too!

931
00:48:54,975 --> 00:48:56,936
Okay. I've... There's... You know...

932
00:48:57,144 --> 00:48:58,896
I'm not having this
conversation with a duck.

933
00:49:00,689 --> 00:49:02,441
Now I'm catching a cold.

934
00:49:02,525 --> 00:49:03,776
I wish I had a cold.

935
00:49:03,984 --> 00:49:06,111
I've had Hefty's crystal
shoved down my throat,

936
00:49:06,195 --> 00:49:09,031
got attacked as a corn dog,
fell down a sewer,

937
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:11,534
and if that wasn't smelly enough,

938
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:15,704
had to travel by armpit just to find
out we're all gonna be extinct!

939
00:49:16,539 --> 00:49:20,417
- Holy smurf, I'm a downer.
- You most certainly are.

940
00:49:20,668 --> 00:49:25,673
Grouchy, the only way we'll be extinct is if
Smurfette gives Gargamel the secret formula.

941
00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:28,008
- But Smurfette would never tell.
- Of course not.

942
00:49:28,092 --> 00:49:29,301
- Never.
- Absolutely not.

943
00:49:29,385 --> 00:49:32,263
Smurfette could never be
tricked into being one of them.

944
00:49:33,389 --> 00:49:34,515
Hey, Smurfette.

945
00:49:34,598 --> 00:49:37,059
Did you do this
with your sisters back in Smurf Village?

946
00:49:37,142 --> 00:49:40,646
Lots of flying, but I never had a sister.

947
00:49:40,729 --> 00:49:42,398
Well, you do now.

948
00:49:42,481 --> 00:49:45,067
- Want to race?
- You want to race me?

949
00:49:45,859 --> 00:49:47,736
You're in trouble now!

950
00:49:49,446 --> 00:49:51,615
- I'm gonna lose you, Smurfette.
- Not a chance.

951
00:50:01,292 --> 00:50:03,168
Watch out!

952
00:50:03,252 --> 00:50:04,837
Hold on tight, Hackus.

953
00:50:05,754 --> 00:50:07,798
- Not that tight, Hackus.
- Sorry.

954
00:50:07,965 --> 00:50:09,842
Stork fight!

955
00:50:10,759 --> 00:50:12,219
Coming through!

956
00:50:13,095 --> 00:50:14,763
This is insane!

957
00:50:16,265 --> 00:50:18,434
Smurf, smurf, and away.

958
00:50:20,019 --> 00:50:22,438
Hackus, king of world!

959
00:50:23,731 --> 00:50:25,524
You're playing dirty now!

960
00:50:25,733 --> 00:50:27,401
I'm just getting started.

961
00:50:27,484 --> 00:50:28,986
Go, go!

962
00:50:29,111 --> 00:50:31,071
I call that a Crepe Smurfette.

963
00:50:32,865 --> 00:50:34,825
Snails to go?

964
00:50:35,951 --> 00:50:37,995
- Batter up!
- Come on!

965
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:40,205
Hit me with your best shot.

966
00:50:42,833 --> 00:50:43,834
Snailed her!

967
00:50:43,917 --> 00:50:46,045
- You are naughty, Smurfette.
- Yeah.

968
00:50:50,257 --> 00:50:53,636
Hey! I've seen that lady before.

969
00:50:53,719 --> 00:50:55,346
She's beautiful.

970
00:50:55,429 --> 00:50:58,474
They've got one of these everywhere.

971
00:50:59,141 --> 00:51:00,559
I'm gonna strangle that duck.

972
00:51:00,643 --> 00:51:02,686
Vic's like a black cloud
that follows me around.

973
00:51:04,063 --> 00:51:05,147
Okay, look, I get it.

974
00:51:05,314 --> 00:51:07,149
But you know what, he's here, isn't he?

975
00:51:07,316 --> 00:51:08,567
He shows up.

976
00:51:08,651 --> 00:51:10,527
Yeah, whether you want him to or not.

977
00:51:10,694 --> 00:51:13,155
Okay, I always heard that
showing up was 90% of the job.

978
00:51:13,656 --> 00:51:15,407
A lot of fathers don't even do that.

979
00:51:15,741 --> 00:51:17,326
He's not my father.

980
00:51:17,576 --> 00:51:19,411
Well, that's too bad.

981
00:51:19,495 --> 00:51:21,830
'Cause that pretty much
leaves you without one.

982
00:51:35,177 --> 00:51:36,845
- Patrick.
- All right, guys.

983
00:51:37,012 --> 00:51:38,555
- Game on.
- Let's do this!

984
00:51:38,639 --> 00:51:40,766
- I'm gonna stay with Blue.
- And Vic.

985
00:51:40,849 --> 00:51:43,352
Okay, Smurfs, off to Gargamel's hotel.

986
00:51:43,435 --> 00:51:44,978
Patrick,
there's actually something I'd like to...

987
00:51:45,062 --> 00:51:46,146
No "actuallys."

988
00:51:46,355 --> 00:51:47,439
You're staying here.

989
00:51:47,606 --> 00:51:48,899
That's not what I was even going...

990
00:51:49,066 --> 00:51:50,651
Victor, don't make me pluck you.

991
00:51:50,818 --> 00:51:52,152
- Let's go.
- Let's do it.

992
00:51:52,319 --> 00:51:56,115
We're gonna get Smurfette this time,
100% guaranteed.

993
00:51:56,323 --> 00:51:57,866
What did you just say, Grouchy?

994
00:51:58,075 --> 00:52:03,038
You heard it. I'm tired of being Grouchy.
I am changing my tune to a happy one.

995
00:52:03,205 --> 00:52:05,082
From now on, lam...

996
00:52:05,207 --> 00:52:07,668
Ready? Positive Smurf.

997
00:52:07,751 --> 00:52:09,920
I sprained my face.

998
00:52:10,129 --> 00:52:12,464
You'll get used to it. Let's go, Smurfs.

999
00:52:12,965 --> 00:52:14,800
- Come on. Come on.
- A paper bag. First-class.

1000
00:52:14,883 --> 00:52:16,760
- Hurry...
- Clumsy!

1001
00:52:17,469 --> 00:52:19,221
Good luck, Daddy!

1002
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:23,183
Le chat VIP.

1003
00:52:23,267 --> 00:52:25,853
Please, I will take you to your room.

1004
00:52:30,983 --> 00:52:33,819
- Front desk.
- Listen well, you slack-jawed knave.

1005
00:52:33,902 --> 00:52:34,987
Monsieur Gargamel.

1006
00:52:35,154 --> 00:52:39,825
I want ale, curds and blistered meats
sent into my room in 10 minutes,

1007
00:52:39,908 --> 00:52:43,245
or I will turn you into
a legless tree sloth.

1008
00:52:44,246 --> 00:52:47,040
How was that, Smurfs?

1009
00:52:47,875 --> 00:52:48,959
That's not funny, man.

1010
00:52:54,757 --> 00:52:58,719
Duck, duck, duck.

1011
00:52:59,303 --> 00:53:00,721
Goose!

1012
00:53:04,057 --> 00:53:07,102
The security card for the elevator.
Patrick needs my help.

1013
00:53:08,771 --> 00:53:13,525
When I show up with this, he'll see
this black cloud has got a silver...

1014
00:53:13,942 --> 00:53:15,569
A silver lining!

1015
00:53:28,791 --> 00:53:30,584
Oh, my...

1016
00:53:30,667 --> 00:53:32,127
Master Winslow, please.

1017
00:53:32,211 --> 00:53:33,754
- You can't get a reservation...
- Focus.

1018
00:53:33,837 --> 00:53:35,464
That smells delish!

1019
00:53:38,258 --> 00:53:39,676
Le bingo.

1020
00:53:43,430 --> 00:53:47,559
Okay, guys, listen, when you get to
the room, if there's any problems...

1021
00:53:48,644 --> 00:53:52,314
- Snot on a half shell. Delicacy.
- Sorry, Mr Fish!

1022
00:53:53,148 --> 00:53:54,483
You look fried.

1023
00:53:54,566 --> 00:53:56,151
Like I said, if there are any problems...

1024
00:53:56,360 --> 00:53:58,278
My friend,
there are no such thing as problems.

1025
00:53:58,362 --> 00:53:59,988
Only smurfitunities.

1026
00:54:00,072 --> 00:54:02,491
- You're freaking me out, Grouchy.
- Positive!

1027
00:54:02,658 --> 00:54:04,201
Of...

1028
00:54:10,499 --> 00:54:12,417
Okay, guys, we're in.

1029
00:54:12,501 --> 00:54:14,461
Patrick Winslow-Doyle.

1030
00:54:15,963 --> 00:54:17,130
Patrick.

1031
00:54:18,715 --> 00:54:21,677
- What are you doing here?
- Saving your tail feather. Now come here.

1032
00:54:21,802 --> 00:54:23,345
I've got something
you need for your mission.

1033
00:54:23,512 --> 00:54:24,680
Hurry up. There's no time to argue.

1034
00:54:26,682 --> 00:54:28,892
- What?
- It's the security card for the elevator.

1035
00:54:29,101 --> 00:54:31,228
I have the security card.

1036
00:54:31,687 --> 00:54:34,690
What is this? This is our room key.

1037
00:54:36,650 --> 00:54:39,152
Well, now when you come back,
you'll be able to get in.

1038
00:54:39,361 --> 00:54:40,571
- No problem.
- I can't...

1039
00:54:40,988 --> 00:54:41,989
No, no, no, no, no.

1040
00:54:43,198 --> 00:54:44,283
You're welcome.

1041
00:54:44,449 --> 00:54:46,451
You can thank me later.

1042
00:54:46,535 --> 00:54:48,036
How did you get out?

1043
00:54:48,203 --> 00:54:49,454
Now, you just put me back down.

1044
00:54:49,538 --> 00:54:50,747
Patrick, help!

1045
00:54:50,956 --> 00:54:53,584
- We need you for our duck a l'orange.
- You want a piece of me?

1046
00:54:53,750 --> 00:54:55,836
No, no, no, no! That's not what I meant.

1047
00:54:55,919 --> 00:54:59,214
Yeah, it starts with the ducks,
and soon, no one's safe!

1048
00:54:59,590 --> 00:55:01,675
- Unbelievable.
- Patrick!

1049
00:55:04,511 --> 00:55:05,512
Master Winslow?

1050
00:55:05,596 --> 00:55:07,431
- Patrick!
- Where'd he go?

1051
00:55:07,806 --> 00:55:09,308
- He disappeared.
- Now we're on our own.

1052
00:55:09,391 --> 00:55:10,809
- Well...
- Hide!

1053
00:55:12,853 --> 00:55:14,146
Monsieur Gargamel.

1054
00:55:19,985 --> 00:55:22,446
We're smurfed. Plan B, anybody?

1055
00:55:22,529 --> 00:55:24,698
I'm struggling to remain positive here.

1056
00:55:30,245 --> 00:55:32,164
Monsieur Gargamel?

1057
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:34,124
Room service.

1058
00:55:36,752 --> 00:55:38,420
Hello, kitty.

1059
00:55:38,921 --> 00:55:40,088
Here is your room service.

1060
00:55:40,255 --> 00:55:44,051
- What do we do?
- Smurf him with the element of surprise.

1061
00:55:45,010 --> 00:55:46,637
Oh, Clumsy!

1062
00:55:48,513 --> 00:55:49,681
- Oh, dear.
- Now what do we do?

1063
00:55:50,766 --> 00:55:52,100
Just act scary.

1064
00:55:52,267 --> 00:55:53,560
What?

1065
00:55:53,685 --> 00:55:56,104
I'm a scary ghost!

1066
00:55:56,396 --> 00:55:57,439
Nice.

1067
00:55:58,899 --> 00:56:01,652
Why do so many bad things
happen to little blue people?

1068
00:56:01,818 --> 00:56:03,654
Positive, positive.

1069
00:56:03,862 --> 00:56:07,324
Window! Window! Window!

1070
00:56:10,118 --> 00:56:13,038
Oh, no!

1071
00:56:13,580 --> 00:56:16,208
Are you smurfing kidding me?
You nearly killed...

1072
00:56:17,084 --> 00:56:19,294
I mean, look at this view.

1073
00:56:23,715 --> 00:56:29,680
If it looks like a duck, quacks like a
duck, and smells like a corn dog...

1074
00:56:29,888 --> 00:56:31,890
All right, which one of you is Vic?

1075
00:56:31,974 --> 00:56:33,809
What, you don't recognise your own father?

1076
00:56:35,435 --> 00:56:37,896
- Let's go.
- What about my brothers?

1077
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:39,815
We can't just leave them here to be eaten.

1078
00:56:39,982 --> 00:56:41,233
You just met them.

1079
00:56:41,483 --> 00:56:44,319
This is my flock.
I can't just leave them behind.

1080
00:56:44,820 --> 00:56:47,197
Come on, if you're game, so am I.

1081
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:52,577
I am covered in filth.

1082
00:56:52,786 --> 00:56:55,080
I look like something the cat dragged in!

1083
00:56:57,833 --> 00:56:59,918
Come on, it's not that bad.

1084
00:57:00,168 --> 00:57:02,295
Although, if I don't... The cat!

1085
00:57:02,504 --> 00:57:05,674
- Not the face. Not the face!
- Close the lid!

1086
00:57:08,135 --> 00:57:10,387
- That was awesome!
- Thank you!

1087
00:57:10,846 --> 00:57:13,015
Hackus lives!

1088
00:57:13,098 --> 00:57:14,349
Vexy, come and help me close the door.

1089
00:57:14,516 --> 00:57:16,101
- Thank you, bird.
- Bye.

1090
00:57:16,184 --> 00:57:17,936
That was crazy.

1091
00:57:19,062 --> 00:57:21,940
Bye-bye, birds. I had fun.

1092
00:57:22,357 --> 00:57:23,358
Yeah.

1093
00:57:23,567 --> 00:57:25,569
- High fours!
- High fours!

1094
00:57:25,652 --> 00:57:28,113
Hackus, Hackus, Hackus.

1095
00:57:28,196 --> 00:57:30,365
It's so nice having another girl around.

1096
00:57:32,951 --> 00:57:33,952
What are you doing?

1097
00:57:34,453 --> 00:57:37,039
Rm just hugging you.

1098
00:57:37,706 --> 00:57:39,916
Haven't you ever been hugged?

1099
00:57:43,545 --> 00:57:45,130
Vexy...

1100
00:57:49,885 --> 00:57:52,888
- Hackus hug. Hackus hug.
- Hackus.

1101
00:57:52,971 --> 00:57:54,806
Hackus squeeze!

1102
00:57:54,890 --> 00:57:56,224
Hackus.

1103
00:57:56,391 --> 00:57:58,977
I'm positive we should
just leave him in here.

1104
00:57:59,061 --> 00:58:00,062
Thanks.

1105
00:58:00,312 --> 00:58:04,274
Hurry. They're probably doing something
mean and horrible to her right now.

1106
00:58:04,441 --> 00:58:07,778
Yeah, Smurfette needs us.
She's probably scared and...

1107
00:58:09,279 --> 00:58:11,364
- I love family!
- What...

1108
00:58:11,907 --> 00:58:13,241
What is she doing?

1109
00:58:13,325 --> 00:58:15,327
I think they're hugging.

1110
00:58:15,410 --> 00:58:16,578
Papa?

1111
00:58:16,787 --> 00:58:18,330
Hackus love to hug.

1112
00:58:18,413 --> 00:58:19,790
Hackus.

1113
00:58:19,873 --> 00:58:22,417
Smurfette, come on,
I got to show you something.

1114
00:58:23,460 --> 00:58:27,172
Look at us. Come on, tell
me we're not family.

1115
00:58:28,715 --> 00:58:30,967
Smurfette!

1116
00:58:31,051 --> 00:58:32,177
Over here!

1117
00:58:32,260 --> 00:58:33,303
Smurfette!

1118
00:58:33,386 --> 00:58:36,431
I'm sorry Papa Smurf didn't come for you.

1119
00:58:36,515 --> 00:58:41,019
But maybe your place is here with us.

1120
00:58:42,521 --> 00:58:43,980
Yeah.

1121
00:58:44,397 --> 00:58:45,607
Maybe it is.

1122
00:58:46,108 --> 00:58:48,276
Why is she being nice to them?

1123
00:58:48,485 --> 00:58:52,114
She's just identifying with her captors.
It's classic Smurf-holm syndrome.

1124
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:56,409
No, she thinks we don't care anymore,
and they do.

1125
00:58:56,493 --> 00:58:57,786
She's confused.

1126
00:58:58,120 --> 00:59:01,164
Clumsy, Grouchy, get up there,
and help me get this door open.

1127
00:59:01,248 --> 00:59:02,332
- That's my daughter in there!
- Okay, Papa.

1128
00:59:02,415 --> 00:59:05,544
- I'll get on top.
- Okay, Grouchy, you jump, I'll pull.

1129
00:59:05,627 --> 00:59:08,088
- Come on, we can do this.
- Children.

1130
00:59:08,255 --> 00:59:11,299
- Gargamel!
- Clumsy, don't let go...

1131
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:13,218
Daddy's home.

1132
00:59:13,301 --> 00:59:18,265
And consistent with his kind nature,
he brought you a present.

1133
00:59:18,473 --> 00:59:19,599
Grouchy, get down. He'll see you.

1134
00:59:19,683 --> 00:59:21,977
- How are we gonna rescue her now?
- Quiet.

1135
00:59:22,144 --> 00:59:24,771
I do believe
we got off on the wrong foot earlier.

1136
00:59:24,855 --> 00:59:25,897
What's happening?

1137
00:59:25,981 --> 00:59:29,734
Would you allow me to wish you
a very, very happy birthday?

1138
00:59:30,652 --> 00:59:32,279
It seems like only yesterday

1139
00:59:32,362 --> 00:59:36,616
you were just my little glob of clay
and other putrid ingredients.

1140
00:59:36,825 --> 00:59:40,412
You remembered my birthday?

1141
00:59:40,495 --> 00:59:42,914
Of course I did. We're family.

1142
00:59:43,081 --> 00:59:44,499
- What?
- But we're her family.

1143
00:59:44,583 --> 00:59:47,377
- Families don't forget things like that.
- Does she think we abandoned her?

1144
00:59:47,544 --> 00:59:51,089
Speaking of which, your little blue
step-papa never did arrive, now did he?

1145
00:59:51,173 --> 00:59:52,507
Step-Papa?

1146
00:59:52,674 --> 00:59:56,011
Why, I am truly sorry, my dear.
That must really sting.

1147
00:59:57,387 --> 01:00:01,641
I remember when my father
threw me down the well for the first time.

1148
01:00:02,559 --> 01:00:07,981
The disappointed look on his face
when I finally managed to claw my way out.

1149
01:00:09,399 --> 01:00:12,152
Anyway, happy birthday, my dear.

1150
01:00:12,235 --> 01:00:13,904
- Happy birthday, Smurfette!
- Happy birthday, Smurfette!

1151
01:00:14,029 --> 01:00:16,489
- I want to open! Let me open!
- No, no, no.

1152
01:00:16,698 --> 01:00:17,866
Ugly.

1153
01:00:22,204 --> 01:00:25,540
"Bow. Kneel. Worship me."

1154
01:00:27,375 --> 01:00:30,545
Yes, delightful rendition, really.

1155
01:00:30,629 --> 01:00:32,797
Keep it up, no-neck,
I'll turn you into a cross-eyed newt.

1156
01:00:34,049 --> 01:00:36,968
Yes, yes, my dear.

1157
01:00:37,052 --> 01:00:38,553
Go ahead, take it.

1158
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:42,891
It's a tiny little magical wand
of your very own.

1159
01:00:42,974 --> 01:00:45,894
Go ahead. It's your birthday present.

1160
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:51,900
No.

1161
01:00:52,025 --> 01:00:53,526
Don't do it.

1162
01:00:55,654 --> 01:00:57,614
Do you like it?

1163
01:00:58,907 --> 01:01:02,285
Silly me. I've forgotten to turn it on.

1164
01:01:03,328 --> 01:01:05,121
Here we are.

1165
01:01:05,747 --> 01:01:09,042
Yes, there we go.

1166
01:01:12,963 --> 01:01:15,757
Yes, go ahead, try it out. Don't be afraid.

1167
01:01:15,924 --> 01:01:17,968
- A Dragon Wand.
- Oh, dear.

1168
01:01:18,218 --> 01:01:21,096
After all, it is your birthright.

1169
01:01:22,555 --> 01:01:24,391
How do you know I won't use it on you?

1170
01:01:25,475 --> 01:01:26,601
Well...

1171
01:01:26,685 --> 01:01:31,106
Because, Smurfette, I am your father.

1172
01:01:31,189 --> 01:01:34,317
Search your feelings.
You know it to be true.

1173
01:01:34,484 --> 01:01:37,028
- She's gonna zap him.
- Get him, Smurfette.

1174
01:01:37,237 --> 01:01:38,530
Smurfette...

1175
01:01:38,613 --> 01:01:40,532
Sing The La La Song.

1176
01:01:45,704 --> 01:01:46,788
Sing it!

1177
01:01:50,583 --> 01:01:52,252
This is good, right, Papa?

1178
01:01:52,335 --> 01:01:54,838
No! She's becoming one of them!

1179
01:01:54,963 --> 01:01:57,590
I have always wanted to do this!

1180
01:02:01,011 --> 01:02:02,345
We're losing her.

1181
01:02:02,554 --> 01:02:05,849
- Yes! Good one, Smurfette.
- Your first cat zap.

1182
01:02:05,932 --> 01:02:08,518
Look at you. Look at you.

1183
01:02:10,270 --> 01:02:14,316
You truly are daddy's little girl.

1184
01:02:14,816 --> 01:02:16,776
- Smurfette!
- No, Papa! Grouchy, grab him!

1185
01:02:16,985 --> 01:02:18,570
- No, Papa, he's gonna see you!
- Get him down!

1186
01:02:18,778 --> 01:02:20,363
- Clumsy, help, help me get him down!
- Papa, no!

1187
01:02:20,989 --> 01:02:22,699
Yeah!

1188
01:02:29,331 --> 01:02:31,666
No!

1189
01:02:33,877 --> 01:02:37,756
Take to the skies, lads.
Free at last! Free at last!

1190
01:02:37,839 --> 01:02:40,342
- What are you, Martin Luther Wing?
- That's it.

1191
01:02:40,508 --> 01:02:45,055
Joke it up, funny boy, but I am proud
as a peacock to be a freedom flighter.

1192
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:46,723
Oh, no.

1193
01:02:46,890 --> 01:02:48,683
What the... is that?

1194
01:02:50,393 --> 01:02:52,854
Hang on, Smurfs! Victor's on the way!

1195
01:02:53,021 --> 01:02:54,898
Pop your smurf-chutes.

1196
01:02:54,981 --> 01:02:56,232
The flying V!

1197
01:02:56,441 --> 01:02:58,276
Gotcha.

1198
01:02:59,152 --> 01:03:00,278
Okay, don't panic.

1199
01:03:00,362 --> 01:03:02,364
That is a lot of white meat.

1200
01:03:03,156 --> 01:03:04,574
Now panic!

1201
01:03:04,866 --> 01:03:06,409
Me no likey!

1202
01:03:12,248 --> 01:03:13,291
That was brilliant.

1203
01:03:13,958 --> 01:03:15,877
- He's naked, right?
- Everyone okay?

1204
01:03:16,086 --> 01:03:19,089
Help me, somebody.
Somebody please, let me out!

1205
01:03:21,049 --> 01:03:24,594
I have seen unspeakable things down there.

1206
01:03:25,220 --> 01:03:27,680
I have been scarred for life.

1207
01:03:29,224 --> 01:03:31,059
Where's Smurfette?

1208
01:03:33,061 --> 01:03:35,021
- She's...
- Where's Smurfette?

1209
01:03:36,064 --> 01:03:38,775
We were too late.

1210
01:03:41,069 --> 01:03:42,070
Nice going.

1211
01:03:45,490 --> 01:03:49,786
Have fun, children.
Just remember, be kind to each other.

1212
01:03:49,869 --> 01:03:52,080
Will you get away from me,
you bumbling moron?

1213
01:03:52,163 --> 01:03:53,832
- Where are they?
- What?

1214
01:03:53,915 --> 01:03:56,751
Smurfs were here? In this room?
Why didn't you say so?

1215
01:03:56,918 --> 01:03:58,503
Right now!

1216
01:04:00,547 --> 01:04:01,589
She must not learn of this.

1217
01:04:01,965 --> 01:04:06,928
We must spirit her away from here
and get that formula now.

1218
01:04:07,387 --> 01:04:10,432
Smurfette, my dear,
are you ready to go celebrate?

1219
01:04:10,515 --> 01:04:12,183
- Yeah!
- Come on, come on. This'll be fun.

1220
01:04:14,310 --> 01:04:15,437
We were this close to
getting Smurfette back.

1221
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:16,521
I know.

1222
01:04:16,604 --> 01:04:19,399
He distracted me
at the worst possible moment, Grace.

1223
01:04:19,482 --> 01:04:21,276
I would have been in the elevator
if it wasn't for him.

1224
01:04:21,359 --> 01:04:24,112
Okay, okay, use your indoor voice,
and please, Patrick, just breathe.

1225
01:04:24,237 --> 01:04:25,864
I want him gone.

1226
01:04:25,947 --> 01:04:28,741
- He's your dad.
- No, that's one thing he is not.

1227
01:04:28,825 --> 01:04:31,119
He's right, Grace. I'm not his father.

1228
01:04:32,495 --> 01:04:34,664
His real father left and
started a new family.

1229
01:04:35,790 --> 01:04:37,417
He's been chewed up about it ever since.

1230
01:04:38,251 --> 01:04:40,170
- Excuse me?
- As well you might.

1231
01:04:40,378 --> 01:04:43,840
But I can't take the brunt of it anymore.

1232
01:04:44,048 --> 01:04:47,552
Hey, I never asked
for you to come barging into my life, okay?

1233
01:04:47,802 --> 01:04:51,556
I didn't ask you to
marry my mother or take away Zeus.

1234
01:04:51,890 --> 01:04:54,100
Zeus? The pigeon?

1235
01:04:54,809 --> 01:04:56,269
The parrot.

1236
01:04:56,352 --> 01:04:57,937
My parrot.

1237
01:04:58,021 --> 01:05:01,107
Taken away because you were allergic.

1238
01:05:04,444 --> 01:05:06,154
I was not allergic to that bird, Patrick.

1239
01:05:06,362 --> 01:05:07,489
Yes, you were.

1240
01:05:08,323 --> 01:05:10,533
No, I wasn't.

1241
01:05:10,617 --> 01:05:11,659
You were.

1242
01:05:12,327 --> 01:05:13,661
What?

1243
01:05:13,870 --> 01:05:17,040
It got so bad, every day,
you were wheezing, coughing.

1244
01:05:17,415 --> 01:05:19,584
Your mother and I both knew
that it would break your heart

1245
01:05:19,667 --> 01:05:22,212
to think the bird
had to go away because of you.

1246
01:05:22,504 --> 01:05:24,756
You already blamed yourself for your dad.

1247
01:05:24,839 --> 01:05:26,090
So I took the heat.

1248
01:05:26,966 --> 01:05:30,512
That's a lie. What are you...
I'm not allergic to birds.

1249
01:05:31,179 --> 01:05:32,931
Okay, tell you what.

1250
01:05:33,515 --> 01:05:34,516
Sniff my feathers.

1251
01:05:34,891 --> 01:05:37,227
- I'm not going to...
- Come on, sniff them.

1252
01:05:43,942 --> 01:05:45,026
Truth itches, doesn't it?

1253
01:05:49,906 --> 01:05:51,991
Listen to me, Patrick.

1254
01:05:52,075 --> 01:05:54,369
I loved your mother with all my heart.

1255
01:05:54,536 --> 01:05:57,830
I took care of Jeannette,
and I made her happy.

1256
01:05:58,081 --> 01:06:00,792
I also chose to love you as my own.

1257
01:06:00,875 --> 01:06:02,377
Now, I didn't have to do that.

1258
01:06:02,460 --> 01:06:07,757
But you were this little kid, no father, no
hope in his eyes, a big hole in his heart,

1259
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:09,384
so I gave you everything I could.

1260
01:06:10,093 --> 01:06:11,928
But I'm done, you know?

1261
01:06:12,011 --> 01:06:14,514
You don't want it, that's fine.

1262
01:06:15,014 --> 01:06:17,016
My last word of advice to you is this...

1263
01:06:18,017 --> 01:06:19,185
Will you grow up?

1264
01:06:19,852 --> 01:06:22,730
Stop blaming everyone else for your pain.

1265
01:06:22,897 --> 01:06:24,023
And whatever you do,

1266
01:06:24,107 --> 01:06:29,696
don't teach that beautiful son of yours that
love is conditional, because it is not.

1267
01:06:31,573 --> 01:06:33,408
Good bye, Grace.

1268
01:06:38,204 --> 01:06:40,081
Bye-bye, Blue.

1269
01:06:49,340 --> 01:06:51,342
Grandpa Vicster.

1270
01:06:55,179 --> 01:06:56,180
Bye.

1271
01:06:59,809 --> 01:07:01,561
Goodbye, Patrick Winslow.

1272
01:07:11,821 --> 01:07:14,449
Look at that big wheel.

1273
01:07:14,532 --> 01:07:17,327
Come. Come along, my dear.

1274
01:07:17,619 --> 01:07:20,705
So this is why they call
it the City of Light.

1275
01:07:21,789 --> 01:07:23,416
There's a lot of people.

1276
01:07:23,666 --> 01:07:25,543
Yes, well...

1277
01:07:25,627 --> 01:07:28,880
I prefer to call them "worshippers."

1278
01:07:28,963 --> 01:07:30,381
"Worshippers."

1279
01:07:31,174 --> 01:07:32,967
Alakakneel!

1280
01:07:34,302 --> 01:07:37,138
Bow. Kneel.

1281
01:07:38,097 --> 01:07:39,432
Hackus.

1282
01:07:39,515 --> 01:07:41,559
- Shall we?
- Let's go.

1283
01:07:41,643 --> 01:07:45,980
Don't worry. Everyone likes it.
He's a celebrity. Come on.

1284
01:07:46,105 --> 01:07:47,315
Okay.

1285
01:07:47,815 --> 01:07:49,776
Yes, hello. It's me.

1286
01:07:49,901 --> 01:07:52,445
- These are my children.
- Hi.

1287
01:07:52,528 --> 01:07:54,113
- Who's that?
- That's my brother.

1288
01:07:54,197 --> 01:07:55,281
Hi. I'm Hackus.

1289
01:07:55,782 --> 01:07:57,950
Look at that. It's a magical creature.

1290
01:07:58,326 --> 01:07:59,786
Hi.

1291
01:07:59,869 --> 01:08:01,204
It's my birthday.

1292
01:08:01,788 --> 01:08:02,830
Thank you.

1293
01:08:02,914 --> 01:08:05,124
- I have a FASTPASS.
- Yeah, FASTPASS.

1294
01:08:06,167 --> 01:08:07,627
Monsieur Gargamel!

1295
01:08:08,294 --> 01:08:10,505
Thank you for keeping our seats warm.
Goodbye.

1296
01:08:10,630 --> 01:08:11,673
Bye-bye!

1297
01:08:11,798 --> 01:08:14,842
Come along, children. Right this way.

1298
01:08:15,093 --> 01:08:18,012
Monsieur Gargamel! Monsieur Gargamel!

1299
01:08:19,514 --> 01:08:20,932
Let's go!

1300
01:08:21,015 --> 01:08:22,266
- Father.
- Not now.

1301
01:08:22,350 --> 01:08:23,768
It's feeding time soon.

1302
01:08:23,851 --> 01:08:25,770
- Not now!
- But...

1303
01:08:27,939 --> 01:08:29,023
Here we are.

1304
01:08:30,191 --> 01:08:33,778
- Our fun is just beginning, eh?
- Yeah.

1305
01:08:34,570 --> 01:08:37,156
Alakazelevate!

1306
01:08:43,037 --> 01:08:45,581
But isn't this lovely, my dear?

1307
01:08:45,957 --> 01:08:47,834
And just think,

1308
01:08:47,917 --> 01:08:52,296
with your secret formula
and my incredible magic,

1309
01:08:52,380 --> 01:08:56,384
there's absolutely nothing
that we cannot do.

1310
01:08:57,719 --> 01:08:59,303
Yeah.

1311
01:08:59,387 --> 01:09:02,515
Think of all the fun we
could have, Smurfette.

1312
01:09:07,854 --> 01:09:09,272
Okay.

1313
01:09:09,355 --> 01:09:12,817
Then why are we going so slow?

1314
01:09:32,503 --> 01:09:34,839
- Look out!
- Yeah!

1315
01:09:34,922 --> 01:09:36,507
Isn't this fun?

1316
01:09:36,591 --> 01:09:38,176
Decidedly not!

1317
01:09:48,561 --> 01:09:52,273
Best ride ever! Smurfette's fun, huh?

1318
01:09:58,821 --> 01:10:00,490
Incoming!

1319
01:10:00,573 --> 01:10:03,284
Look out! Coming through!

1320
01:10:06,454 --> 01:10:07,747
Sorry!

1321
01:10:24,472 --> 01:10:26,140
I must have failed her.

1322
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:30,812
Sorry. I was looking for a place to think.

1323
01:10:30,978 --> 01:10:33,564
No, no, no, no. It's okay.

1324
01:10:33,648 --> 01:10:36,317
I was doing a little thinking myself.

1325
01:10:39,946 --> 01:10:42,949
Master Winslow, it's hard for me,

1326
01:10:43,115 --> 01:10:46,452
but, well, can I ask you some advice?

1327
01:10:46,661 --> 01:10:48,496
I mean, papa to Papa.

1328
01:10:49,622 --> 01:10:51,332
It's about Smurfette.

1329
01:10:52,166 --> 01:10:53,835
I don't know what to do.

1330
01:10:54,001 --> 01:10:56,128
I turned her blue.

1331
01:10:56,212 --> 01:10:59,006
I taught her love and kindness.

1332
01:10:59,131 --> 01:11:02,009
But the truth is, Gargamel made her.

1333
01:11:02,093 --> 01:11:06,138
She's only a Smurf
as long as she chooses to be.

1334
01:11:06,222 --> 01:11:08,558
But what if she doesn't?

1335
01:11:10,226 --> 01:11:12,436
What if she chooses him?

1336
01:11:12,520 --> 01:11:14,689
We could lose her.

1337
01:11:14,772 --> 01:11:16,691
We may have already.

1338
01:11:18,609 --> 01:11:20,319
I haven't done enough.

1339
01:11:20,403 --> 01:11:21,779
Are you kidding?

1340
01:11:21,946 --> 01:11:24,323
Gargamel just made her, but you,

1341
01:11:24,407 --> 01:11:25,783
you made her what she is.

1342
01:11:25,867 --> 01:11:28,744
You stepped in and loved her
as your very own.

1343
01:11:29,036 --> 01:11:31,038
No one asked you to, you just did.

1344
01:11:31,372 --> 01:11:33,624
Because you knew she needed that.

1345
01:11:33,708 --> 01:11:35,835
And that's a...

1346
01:11:38,379 --> 01:11:41,924
That's a pretty special kind of love.

1347
01:11:44,552 --> 01:11:46,721
She's way too smart not to see that.

1348
01:11:49,390 --> 01:11:50,975
You're right.

1349
01:11:51,058 --> 01:11:53,728
We didn't believe in her
because she changed.

1350
01:11:53,811 --> 01:11:56,188
She changed because we believed in her.

1351
01:11:57,982 --> 01:11:59,650
Thank you, Master Winslow.

1352
01:11:59,734 --> 01:12:03,070
That was exactly what I needed to hear.

1353
01:12:11,913 --> 01:12:13,414
Me, too.

1354
01:12:15,625 --> 01:12:17,293
Just a few more bubbles.

1355
01:12:17,543 --> 01:12:18,920
How's that?

1356
01:12:19,003 --> 01:12:22,256
Sweet Smurf in Heaven,
what have you eaten?

1357
01:12:22,423 --> 01:12:25,760
It's okay.
Every time a Smurf toots, someone smiles.

1358
01:12:26,594 --> 01:12:28,012
- Let's go, Smurfs.
- Where?

1359
01:12:28,095 --> 01:12:29,263
We're getting Smurfette.

1360
01:12:29,430 --> 01:12:31,182
But you saw her, Papa.

1361
01:12:31,766 --> 01:12:33,184
She's one of them now.

1362
01:12:33,267 --> 01:12:35,019
- A horse whisperer?
- No!

1363
01:12:35,102 --> 01:12:37,063
- A French Socialist?
- No!

1364
01:12:37,146 --> 01:12:38,272
A Flying Wallenda!

1365
01:12:38,356 --> 01:12:40,149
No, she's with Gargamel. Keep up.

1366
01:12:40,358 --> 01:12:42,026
I don't care what we saw.

1367
01:12:42,109 --> 01:12:44,445
You never give up on family.

1368
01:12:44,528 --> 01:12:46,447
Yeah, Papa's right.

1369
01:12:46,530 --> 01:12:48,824
Who are you,
and what have you done with Grouchy?

1370
01:12:48,908 --> 01:12:51,035
Hey, I'm Positive, remember?

1371
01:12:51,619 --> 01:12:54,163
All right, Smurfs. Let's get smurfing.

1372
01:12:55,122 --> 01:12:57,291
Master Winslow, you coming with us?

1373
01:12:57,458 --> 01:12:58,960
Is a Smurf's butt blue?

1374
01:13:01,212 --> 01:13:02,463
You tell me.

1375
01:13:02,922 --> 01:13:04,048
Grouchy.

1376
01:13:04,340 --> 01:13:07,051
- Put it away.
- Anybody else?

1377
01:13:07,677 --> 01:13:09,762
Okay, then. Out of the tub with you.

1378
01:13:09,845 --> 01:13:10,930
- We've got work to do.
- Hey.

1379
01:13:11,013 --> 01:13:13,140
Let's smurf this mushroom stand.
Let's roll.

1380
01:13:13,224 --> 01:13:15,393
Yeah, guys, let's do this.

1381
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:25,444
Victor? Hey.

1382
01:13:54,181 --> 01:13:56,058
Okay, Master Winslow, we'll split up here.

1383
01:13:56,225 --> 01:13:58,310
All right. I'll find the
electrical room and cut the power.

1384
01:13:58,519 --> 01:13:59,520
And we'll find Smurfette.

1385
01:13:59,603 --> 01:14:01,689
And we'll all look fabulous doing it.

1386
01:14:02,064 --> 01:14:03,357
Oh, come on.

1387
01:14:03,441 --> 01:14:05,401
Team building. Hello!

1388
01:14:05,568 --> 01:14:08,029
All right, see you inside. Good luck.

1389
01:14:08,195 --> 01:14:10,031
- Come on, guys.
- lnto the belly of the beast.

1390
01:14:12,366 --> 01:14:14,660
Why are we coming down here, Father?

1391
01:14:14,744 --> 01:14:18,706
Well, we are celebrating
your long-lost sister's birthday.

1392
01:14:18,789 --> 01:14:19,790
Really?

1393
01:14:19,874 --> 01:14:22,293
Can't very well end the festivities without

1394
01:14:23,919 --> 01:14:25,212
a cake.

1395
01:14:26,338 --> 01:14:29,717
I made you your favourite, my dear.
Blue velvet.

1396
01:14:31,385 --> 01:14:32,511
Cake.

1397
01:14:33,596 --> 01:14:36,640
Go ahead. Go ahead. Make a wish, my dear.

1398
01:14:36,724 --> 01:14:41,270
Anything your tiny little heart
can dream of, and it is yours.

1399
01:14:41,604 --> 01:14:43,064
Anything?

1400
01:14:43,147 --> 01:14:44,440
But of course.

1401
01:14:45,232 --> 01:14:46,901
Yes, well, within reason.

1402
01:14:46,984 --> 01:14:51,238
I'm afraid we're on a bit
of an essence budget around here lately.

1403
01:14:51,322 --> 01:14:54,742
That's why we need the formula, you see.

1404
01:15:01,499 --> 01:15:03,250
There she is.

1405
01:15:03,417 --> 01:15:05,294
Is that a birthday cake?

1406
01:15:05,377 --> 01:15:07,254
We had a birthday cake for her, too.

1407
01:15:07,421 --> 01:15:09,840
She just never saw it.

1408
01:15:09,924 --> 01:15:12,885
They look like a happy family.

1409
01:15:12,968 --> 01:15:15,304
She's not going to give him the formula,
is she, Papa?

1410
01:15:15,387 --> 01:15:18,974
If she does,
it would mean the end of all Smurf kind.

1411
01:15:20,601 --> 01:15:22,686
Wait. Even the handsome ones?

1412
01:15:22,812 --> 01:15:24,772
- Yeah.
- Vanity, you come with me.

1413
01:15:24,855 --> 01:15:27,108
Clumsy and Grouchy,
go meet Master Winslow.

1414
01:15:38,410 --> 01:15:40,204
Victor, what are you doing here?

1415
01:15:40,287 --> 01:15:41,413
Grace called me.

1416
01:15:41,539 --> 01:15:43,624
She said you might need a hand.

1417
01:15:46,502 --> 01:15:48,337
No, no. Victor, wait.

1418
01:15:49,922 --> 01:15:51,924
As usual, Grace is right.

1419
01:15:52,883 --> 01:15:53,926
I could use some help.

1420
01:15:54,510 --> 01:15:57,680
Well, for starters,
you might try lifting the sewer cover.

1421
01:15:57,763 --> 01:15:59,181
Unless you're planning
on fixing the phone lines?

1422
01:16:04,854 --> 01:16:06,981
Smurfette, the formula?

1423
01:16:07,064 --> 01:16:08,941
Take all the time you need, my dear.

1424
01:16:09,108 --> 01:16:10,734
As long as it's very, very soon.

1425
01:16:10,901 --> 01:16:13,737
Then we can all be blue. Together.

1426
01:16:13,863 --> 01:16:17,116
Hackus blue. Hackus blue.

1427
01:16:17,658 --> 01:16:19,243
You see? They want to be blue,

1428
01:16:19,660 --> 01:16:21,495
just like their big sister.

1429
01:16:21,996 --> 01:16:24,665
Then we could be a real family.

1430
01:16:29,086 --> 01:16:31,005
This is something.

1431
01:16:31,088 --> 01:16:35,384
A sacred gift entrusted to me.

1432
01:16:38,345 --> 01:16:39,847
I'm sorry.

1433
01:16:41,140 --> 01:16:42,725
I just, I...

1434
01:16:44,226 --> 01:16:45,519
I can't.

1435
01:16:48,355 --> 01:16:50,941
What do you mean, you can't?

1436
01:16:51,025 --> 01:16:52,359
I've given you everything.

1437
01:16:52,985 --> 01:16:54,570
Kindness, presents,

1438
01:16:54,737 --> 01:16:57,781
a cake with no poison. It's been horrible!

1439
01:16:57,865 --> 01:17:00,576
Now, I have had just about enough of this,
young lady.

1440
01:17:00,659 --> 01:17:03,454
You are going to give me
what I want right now!

1441
01:17:03,537 --> 01:17:04,872
- The formula!
- No!

1442
01:17:04,955 --> 01:17:05,956
Yes!

1443
01:17:06,040 --> 01:17:07,374
- Father?
- What, what, what?

1444
01:17:09,668 --> 01:17:12,338
Hackus dizzy.

1445
01:17:12,421 --> 01:17:14,006
What's happening to them?

1446
01:17:14,173 --> 01:17:15,424
So dizzy.

1447
01:17:15,507 --> 01:17:18,969
Don't tell me you actually care
for these pathetic creatures.

1448
01:17:19,053 --> 01:17:20,304
How sad for you.

1449
01:17:22,056 --> 01:17:26,227
And how absolutely perfect for me.

1450
01:17:26,727 --> 01:17:27,978
It looks like the power lines run this way.

1451
01:17:28,062 --> 01:17:29,813
Let's go! Let's go!
We got to get her out of there!

1452
01:17:29,897 --> 01:17:31,357
All right, let's do this!

1453
01:17:31,523 --> 01:17:33,651
This way, Vanity. Through this pipe.

1454
01:17:33,734 --> 01:17:36,987
We have to save her!
This could be my moment!

1455
01:17:38,864 --> 01:17:42,826
I'm so sorry, my dear. I thought you knew.

1456
01:17:42,910 --> 01:17:46,247
Without essence, they cannot live.

1457
01:17:47,414 --> 01:17:48,791
- Father.
- No.

1458
01:17:48,958 --> 01:17:50,125
Please.

1459
01:17:50,209 --> 01:17:51,835
No. Vexy.

1460
01:17:55,422 --> 01:17:57,508
So dizzy.

1461
01:17:58,092 --> 01:18:00,302
- Hackus.
- Smurfette.

1462
01:18:00,928 --> 01:18:02,930
Give them what you have!
Take some from me.

1463
01:18:03,055 --> 01:18:04,056
Take some!

1464
01:18:05,099 --> 01:18:06,141
Please!

1465
01:18:06,225 --> 01:18:08,769
What's the point?
You won't give me the formula,

1466
01:18:08,852 --> 01:18:12,690
so, well, I might as well just let them go.

1467
01:18:13,065 --> 01:18:14,149
Vexy.

1468
01:18:15,567 --> 01:18:18,279
You mean you'd let them die?

1469
01:18:19,571 --> 01:18:21,282
I can always make others.

1470
01:18:21,407 --> 01:18:25,202
Besides, I am not the one letting them die.

1471
01:18:25,619 --> 01:18:26,704
You are.

1472
01:18:29,123 --> 01:18:31,083
Okay. Okay.

1473
01:18:31,458 --> 01:18:34,378
I'll give it to you. Just feed them.

1474
01:18:35,587 --> 01:18:37,464
The formula first.

1475
01:18:37,673 --> 01:18:40,301
Feed them. Feed them!

1476
01:18:40,467 --> 01:18:41,927
Quickly. We have to get in there.

1477
01:18:42,011 --> 01:18:44,138
- Dead end!
- It's locked!

1478
01:18:45,681 --> 01:18:49,143
The formu-la-la-la-la-la-la.

1479
01:18:51,645 --> 01:18:53,147
One hopeful thought.

1480
01:18:54,356 --> 01:18:56,442
A dab of royal jelly.

1481
01:18:57,860 --> 01:18:59,153
Mimosa pollen.

1482
01:18:59,236 --> 01:19:00,279
Smurfette.

1483
01:19:00,362 --> 01:19:02,614
- Smurfette!
- Yes, good girl.

1484
01:19:02,823 --> 01:19:04,742
I can hear them, but I can't see them.

1485
01:19:04,825 --> 01:19:06,952
Wait! I know.

1486
01:19:07,036 --> 01:19:08,078
Papa, look.

1487
01:19:08,245 --> 01:19:09,705
- And a drop of mink oil.
- I knew it.

1488
01:19:09,788 --> 01:19:12,082
Is she giving him the formula?

1489
01:19:12,166 --> 01:19:13,542
- Oh, no.
- Smurfette.

1490
01:19:13,625 --> 01:19:14,668
Help me get this open.

1491
01:19:15,169 --> 01:19:17,796
And you must say one loving truth.

1492
01:19:18,422 --> 01:19:20,174
- Of course.
- There.

1493
01:19:20,299 --> 01:19:22,426
That's the formula Papa used.

1494
01:19:22,509 --> 01:19:24,178
Now, feed them! Please!

1495
01:19:24,261 --> 01:19:25,346
First, we'll see if this works, huh?

1496
01:19:27,348 --> 01:19:28,557
Hurry!

1497
01:19:29,725 --> 01:19:30,768
- Come on.
- Here we are.

1498
01:19:30,851 --> 01:19:32,186
Let's go! Let's go!

1499
01:19:33,854 --> 01:19:35,481
Pull, Patrick. Put your back into it.

1500
01:19:35,731 --> 01:19:38,150
- Come on!
- Hey, there's an opening down here.

1501
01:19:38,359 --> 01:19:40,903
- Come on, Positive.
- Yeah, let's shut 'em down.

1502
01:19:41,320 --> 01:19:43,614
One loving truth.

1503
01:19:43,697 --> 01:19:45,366
I hope this works.

1504
01:20:29,243 --> 01:20:30,536
Hackus.

1505
01:20:32,162 --> 01:20:35,749
- Smurfette. Thank you.
- Vexy!

1506
01:20:35,916 --> 01:20:39,086
Oh, my Smurf, it worked.

1507
01:20:39,253 --> 01:20:40,587
- Hackus!
- Hackus blue!

1508
01:20:40,671 --> 01:20:42,589
Hackus.

1509
01:20:42,714 --> 01:20:44,425
Hackus is blue!

1510
01:20:44,550 --> 01:20:47,010
We're blue! We're Smurfs!

1511
01:20:47,136 --> 01:20:49,346
It worked. All the world is mine!

1512
01:20:49,680 --> 01:20:52,433
- I can make my own Smurfs!
- No!

1513
01:20:53,934 --> 01:20:56,603
We've been betrayed.

1514
01:20:57,104 --> 01:20:59,314
Finally, finally.

1515
01:20:59,398 --> 01:21:01,275
You're a real boy.

1516
01:21:01,442 --> 01:21:02,443
I'm blue.

1517
01:21:02,609 --> 01:21:04,445
Now into the machine with all of you.

1518
01:21:04,653 --> 01:21:05,696
Father, no.

1519
01:21:06,655 --> 01:21:10,617
- No cage for Hackus. No cage for Hackus.
- All right, all right.

1520
01:21:11,243 --> 01:21:13,120
- In you go.
- No cage for Hackus!

1521
01:21:13,203 --> 01:21:15,289
- Everybody gets their own room.
- Please!

1522
01:21:15,706 --> 01:21:18,750
- I failed her, Vanity.
- Papa, wait.

1523
01:21:19,460 --> 01:21:21,336
I think I can reach that pin.

1524
01:21:21,420 --> 01:21:22,921
Good idea, Vanity.

1525
01:21:23,005 --> 01:21:24,381
Come on, come on.

1526
01:21:25,299 --> 01:21:26,675
Father, please.

1527
01:21:26,758 --> 01:21:28,260
Now, don't go anywhere.

1528
01:21:30,596 --> 01:21:33,807
You face leaking.

1529
01:21:35,142 --> 01:21:37,311
Hackus leaking.

1530
01:21:38,604 --> 01:21:41,231
Hackus leaking.

1531
01:21:41,315 --> 01:21:46,111
You sacrificed everything just to save us.

1532
01:21:46,695 --> 01:21:48,155
I had to.

1533
01:21:48,739 --> 01:21:49,907
I care about you.

1534
01:21:51,992 --> 01:21:53,535
We're family.

1535
01:21:54,703 --> 01:21:56,914
No like leaking.

1536
01:21:56,997 --> 01:21:58,749
Hackus like blue.

1537
01:21:58,916 --> 01:22:01,084
What a sickening scene.

1538
01:22:01,168 --> 01:22:03,837
I'd be completely nauseated if this weren't

1539
01:22:04,046 --> 01:22:06,924
the happiest moment of my life!

1540
01:22:07,090 --> 01:22:09,092
- Try the lever, the big one.
- Get on my shoulders.

1541
01:22:09,384 --> 01:22:10,844
Hurry, lads.

1542
01:22:10,928 --> 01:22:11,970
Which way do I go?

1543
01:22:12,054 --> 01:22:13,972
Try negative. That might shut it off.

1544
01:22:14,056 --> 01:22:16,892
Negative? Nah. I'm all about positive.

1545
01:22:20,187 --> 01:22:21,230
There.

1546
01:22:21,313 --> 01:22:25,275
One small step for a wizard,

1547
01:22:25,359 --> 01:22:28,362
one giant leap for... What?

1548
01:22:29,613 --> 01:22:30,697
Positive!

1549
01:22:31,198 --> 01:22:33,325
Too much smurf berry cobbler.

1550
01:22:33,617 --> 01:22:34,618
Grouchy!

1551
01:22:34,868 --> 01:22:37,788
Yes, I said you could press the button,
didn't I?

1552
01:22:40,249 --> 01:22:42,125
Grouchy!

1553
01:22:42,292 --> 01:22:44,378
I lied. One giant leap for me!

1554
01:22:49,299 --> 01:22:50,759
Just got fried.

1555
01:22:50,842 --> 01:22:53,220
Hard to put a positive spin on that.

1556
01:22:58,392 --> 01:22:59,560
Son of a Smurf!

1557
01:22:59,726 --> 01:23:00,727
Hurry, Vanity.

1558
01:23:00,811 --> 01:23:04,064
Narcissism is about to save the day.

1559
01:23:04,565 --> 01:23:05,691
- Got it!
- Smurftastic work.

1560
01:23:05,816 --> 01:23:07,025
- I knew it.
- Now go.

1561
01:23:07,109 --> 01:23:08,569
- What?
- Go!

1562
01:23:08,735 --> 01:23:09,945
Come, Azrael!

1563
01:23:10,028 --> 01:23:14,324
Apparently, we must harness
the power of the skies one final time.

1564
01:23:14,408 --> 01:23:15,826
Why does this have to be so Les Misérables?

1565
01:23:15,909 --> 01:23:18,453
- Let's go.
- Look at me, all rough-and-tumble.

1566
01:23:18,537 --> 01:23:20,497
I'm like Commando Smurf.

1567
01:23:20,581 --> 01:23:21,790
Hooah!

1568
01:23:22,833 --> 01:23:25,377
You are right.
Commandos are quiet and stealthy.

1569
01:23:25,586 --> 01:23:26,962
Hooah!

1570
01:23:27,045 --> 01:23:28,505
- There she is!
- Smurfette.

1571
01:23:29,590 --> 01:23:30,841
Santa!

1572
01:23:31,300 --> 01:23:34,303
Papa? You... You came for me.

1573
01:23:34,469 --> 01:23:37,723
Well, of course we came for you.
You're my daughter.

1574
01:23:37,889 --> 01:23:39,600
Was there ever a question?

1575
01:23:39,808 --> 01:23:41,393
- No, it's locked.
- Go on through.

1576
01:23:41,602 --> 01:23:42,686
- We'll find another way.
- Okay.

1577
01:23:42,769 --> 01:23:45,230
We'll see you in there, Master Winslow.
Hurry!

1578
01:23:48,650 --> 01:23:49,901
Here.

1579
01:23:50,569 --> 01:23:51,862
Hold this!

1580
01:24:08,670 --> 01:24:09,880
Papa.

1581
01:24:09,963 --> 01:24:12,132
Oh, my dear.

1582
01:24:12,799 --> 01:24:16,470
Papa, I gave Gargamel the formula.

1583
01:24:16,678 --> 01:24:18,221
But she saved our lives.

1584
01:24:18,388 --> 01:24:20,849
Hackus live! Hackus live!

1585
01:24:20,932 --> 01:24:23,810
Papa, I let you down.

1586
01:24:24,645 --> 01:24:27,064
I betrayed the Smurfs.

1587
01:24:27,147 --> 01:24:28,649
I'm so sorry.

1588
01:24:28,857 --> 01:24:33,737
Smurfette, life is the most precious thing
to protect.

1589
01:24:33,820 --> 01:24:35,906
I'm very proud of you.

1590
01:24:35,989 --> 01:24:37,949
You... You are?

1591
01:24:38,158 --> 01:24:41,036
Seriously? No spanking?
No smack to the knuckles?

1592
01:24:41,119 --> 01:24:43,163
You forgive her, just like that?

1593
01:24:43,413 --> 01:24:46,750
Of course.
We rise to the amount of love we're shown,

1594
01:24:46,833 --> 01:24:50,128
and we sink only when that love stops.

1595
01:24:50,212 --> 01:24:53,882
Hackus leaking again. Leaking again!

1596
01:24:54,299 --> 01:24:55,676
Hey, you found Smurfette!

1597
01:24:56,343 --> 01:24:57,552
Hello.

1598
01:24:58,595 --> 01:24:59,638
Hi.

1599
01:25:01,556 --> 01:25:02,766
Oh, no, we don't have much time.

1600
01:25:02,974 --> 01:25:06,228
Let's just get the formula back
and get out of here. Hooah!

1601
01:25:06,353 --> 01:25:07,938
Wait! What about them?

1602
01:25:08,105 --> 01:25:10,065
What about them? They kidnapped you.

1603
01:25:10,148 --> 01:25:11,441
Yeah, they're Gargamel's.

1604
01:25:11,525 --> 01:25:16,071
So was I, but Papa never gave up on me.

1605
01:25:16,154 --> 01:25:18,532
So I'm not about to give up on them.

1606
01:25:19,157 --> 01:25:21,493
And you thought you weren't a real Smurf.

1607
01:25:22,786 --> 01:25:24,371
- Get them out, quickly.
- Right, Papa.

1608
01:25:24,454 --> 01:25:26,039
Free Hackus!

1609
01:25:26,206 --> 01:25:28,625
And then there were seven, eh?

1610
01:25:29,835 --> 01:25:31,169
Hello, kitty.

1611
01:25:31,378 --> 01:25:33,880
Welcome to the party, Papa!

1612
01:25:35,382 --> 01:25:37,843
Look at all this essence.

1613
01:25:40,512 --> 01:25:43,640
I love your work. Really, all of you.

1614
01:25:43,724 --> 01:25:46,560
In particular, your Blue Period.

1615
01:25:47,227 --> 01:25:50,063
My whole body is scrunching!

1616
01:25:50,272 --> 01:25:52,482
That's enough, Gargamel.

1617
01:25:52,566 --> 01:25:53,984
You have enough.

1618
01:25:54,067 --> 01:25:58,822
Yes, yes, but you see, Papa,
I want more than enough!

1619
01:26:01,491 --> 01:26:05,078
After all, I have to be able to power this!

1620
01:26:06,913 --> 01:26:10,167
I call her La Wanda.

1621
01:26:11,877 --> 01:26:13,545
You get it? Because it's a wand.

1622
01:26:13,628 --> 01:26:15,422
So I called it La... It's very funny.

1623
01:26:15,505 --> 01:26:19,342
If you weren't in excruciating pain,
you'd be laughing hysterically, believe me.

1624
01:26:23,722 --> 01:26:27,476
Whatever will I do with all of this power?

1625
01:26:29,436 --> 01:26:30,604
That's right.

1626
01:26:30,687 --> 01:26:34,024
I'm going to rule the entire world!

1627
01:26:34,274 --> 01:26:35,609
No.

1628
01:26:36,318 --> 01:26:37,527
And, Papa,

1629
01:26:37,611 --> 01:26:40,489
I want you to know
that as my first official act,

1630
01:26:40,572 --> 01:26:47,329
I'm going to create a portal all the way from
Smurf Village right here to my Smurfalator,

1631
01:26:47,412 --> 01:26:51,750
so you get to be
with all of your little smurfy friends.

1632
01:26:53,668 --> 01:26:55,378
Forever!

1633
01:26:55,462 --> 01:26:56,588
I don't think so, Gargamel.

1634
01:27:00,759 --> 01:27:01,843
Hit it again.

1635
01:27:02,052 --> 01:27:03,136
- Give it to me.
- Hurry.

1636
01:27:04,387 --> 01:27:06,223
Hurry, he's going for his wand.

1637
01:27:07,140 --> 01:27:09,935
- Just break it already!
- I'm too beautiful to die!

1638
01:27:10,936 --> 01:27:13,855
For the love of Smurf, use the pointy end!

1639
01:27:13,939 --> 01:27:16,107
Don't just stand there yelling at me!
Attack!

1640
01:27:17,317 --> 01:27:18,360
Yes!

1641
01:27:21,863 --> 01:27:23,073
Oh, no.

1642
01:27:25,033 --> 01:27:26,326
Alaka...

1643
01:28:14,040 --> 01:28:15,792
Hackus real boy.

1644
01:28:16,376 --> 01:28:18,378
Thrown to the curb again.

1645
01:28:18,461 --> 01:28:20,213
Careful, Clumsy!

1646
01:28:20,297 --> 01:28:22,007
- Every time!
- Sorry.

1647
01:28:22,173 --> 01:28:23,216
Really?

1648
01:28:23,300 --> 01:28:24,467
High fours!

1649
01:28:35,312 --> 01:28:36,521
Is everyone all right?

1650
01:28:36,730 --> 01:28:38,773
All smurfy and accounted for.

1651
01:28:39,024 --> 01:28:41,109
- Patrick!
- Daddy!

1652
01:28:41,192 --> 01:28:42,777
- Hey.
- Hey, Grace!

1653
01:28:42,861 --> 01:28:44,237
Hey.

1654
01:28:45,322 --> 01:28:46,489
We did it!

1655
01:28:46,573 --> 01:28:48,116
Grace!

1656
01:28:48,199 --> 01:28:49,284
Smurfette.

1657
01:28:49,451 --> 01:28:50,577
I've missed you.

1658
01:28:51,328 --> 01:28:53,079
I was so worried about you.

1659
01:28:53,246 --> 01:28:56,333
Grace, this is Vexy, my other sister.

1660
01:28:57,542 --> 01:28:59,794
Well, I guess that makes
you my sister, too.

1661
01:29:01,630 --> 01:29:03,089
Are you okay?

1662
01:29:05,634 --> 01:29:07,886
Is this what happy feels like?

1663
01:29:08,762 --> 01:29:11,014
Hello, pretty lady! I'm pretty, too!

1664
01:29:11,097 --> 01:29:13,642
And this is Hackus, my brother.

1665
01:29:13,725 --> 01:29:14,768
Hackus!

1666
01:29:14,893 --> 01:29:16,770
Hackus, this is Grace and Patrick.

1667
01:29:17,145 --> 01:29:19,481
- Hello!
- And... Your baby?

1668
01:29:19,648 --> 01:29:20,941
This is Blue.

1669
01:29:21,441 --> 01:29:22,984
You did good, Grace.

1670
01:29:23,068 --> 01:29:24,861
He's blue-tiful.

1671
01:29:25,445 --> 01:29:26,988
Who this? Who this?

1672
01:29:27,072 --> 01:29:28,573
That's Victor.

1673
01:29:28,740 --> 01:29:29,783
He's...

1674
01:29:29,908 --> 01:29:30,909
He's my dad.

1675
01:29:32,285 --> 01:29:34,746
And Blue's pretty fantastic grandpa.

1676
01:29:40,669 --> 01:29:42,295
Daddy and Vicster!

1677
01:29:44,297 --> 01:29:46,508
Okay. I got it.

1678
01:29:46,758 --> 01:29:48,301
I'm really proud of you, Patrick Winslow.

1679
01:29:48,468 --> 01:29:50,720
Hyphen-Doyle.

1680
01:29:51,471 --> 01:29:52,889
Hyphen-Smurf.

1681
01:29:53,682 --> 01:29:56,142
Yeah, guys! Smurf pound.

1682
01:29:56,226 --> 01:29:58,770
- Vanity?
- Great job! Great job!

1683
01:29:58,853 --> 01:30:00,563
- Positive?
- Hey, get that thing out of here!

1684
01:30:00,647 --> 01:30:01,940
I'm not pounding anything!

1685
01:30:02,023 --> 01:30:05,360
I'm Grouchy,
and I got a lot of pent-up anger to vent!

1686
01:30:05,735 --> 01:30:07,612
Wow, that feels good.

1687
01:30:07,696 --> 01:30:08,863
I'm back!

1688
01:30:09,280 --> 01:30:10,949
And so am I!

1689
01:30:11,491 --> 01:30:12,575
Perfect.

1690
01:30:12,742 --> 01:30:14,369
I think most of you know La Wanda...

1691
01:30:14,452 --> 01:30:17,747
Unfortunately.
- ...which is a hilarious play on words.

1692
01:30:18,748 --> 01:30:22,585
- Smurfette.
- Say hello to my enormous friend!

1693
01:30:22,877 --> 01:30:25,296
I don't think so, Gargamel!

1694
01:30:29,718 --> 01:30:30,844
Yeah!

1695
01:30:32,137 --> 01:30:34,639
Wanda! No, La Wanda, no!

1696
01:30:34,723 --> 01:30:37,517
Where is the "off" button on this thing?

1697
01:30:45,775 --> 01:30:46,860
No, no, no, no.

1698
01:30:47,610 --> 01:30:48,737
No...

1699
01:30:54,034 --> 01:30:56,161
No, La Wanda! No means no!

1700
01:31:13,053 --> 01:31:15,513
This is really, really gonna hurt.

1701
01:31:22,062 --> 01:31:24,814
- Bravo, Smurfette! Bravo!
- Good job, Smurfette!

1702
01:31:24,898 --> 01:31:26,316
That was amazing!

1703
01:31:26,399 --> 01:31:28,234
Well, that takes care of Gargamel.

1704
01:31:28,651 --> 01:31:30,153
Let's go home, everybody!

1705
01:31:30,236 --> 01:31:31,362
- Yeah!
- Home!

1706
01:31:31,446 --> 01:31:33,990
We still have one small problem.

1707
01:31:34,074 --> 01:31:35,825
I've only got five crystals.

1708
01:31:35,992 --> 01:31:39,579
Well, I say no Smurf left behind.

1709
01:31:40,413 --> 01:31:42,707
Wow, Smurfette.

1710
01:31:42,791 --> 01:31:45,251
You are pretty good with that wand.

1711
01:31:46,002 --> 01:31:47,670
It's kind of in my blood.

1712
01:31:47,754 --> 01:31:49,756
Which used to concern me.

1713
01:31:50,423 --> 01:31:52,759
But as someone wonderful once told me,

1714
01:31:52,842 --> 01:31:55,178
it doesn't matter where you came from.

1715
01:31:55,261 --> 01:31:59,099
What matters is who you choose to be.

1716
01:31:59,182 --> 01:32:01,184
That's my girl.

1717
01:32:01,267 --> 01:32:03,436
And you're our papa.

1718
01:32:04,604 --> 01:32:06,523
Thanks for giving us a new home.

1719
01:32:06,606 --> 01:32:08,942
And a new family.

1720
01:32:09,025 --> 01:32:10,568
You're a good Smurf, Papa.

1721
01:32:10,652 --> 01:32:12,946
You'll be a good one, too.

1722
01:32:13,196 --> 01:32:14,614
I'm gonna miss you, Smurfs.

1723
01:32:14,697 --> 01:32:16,241
Maybe you can name a corn dog after them.

1724
01:32:16,491 --> 01:32:18,993
Now you're talking. We could use blue corn.

1725
01:32:19,202 --> 01:32:20,662
Smurf dogs, yum!

1726
01:32:21,287 --> 01:32:22,455
Yes!

1727
01:32:22,539 --> 01:32:23,873
Well, safe travels, guys.

1728
01:32:24,374 --> 01:32:26,376
And smurf back soon.

1729
01:32:26,459 --> 01:32:28,503
Thank you once again, Master Winslow.

1730
01:32:31,422 --> 01:32:32,715
Miss Doolittle.

1731
01:32:33,967 --> 01:32:35,218
Little Blue.

1732
01:32:35,635 --> 01:32:36,970
Papa Vicster.

1733
01:32:38,596 --> 01:32:40,431
- Goodbye, Winslow family.
- Goodbye, Papa.

1734
01:32:40,515 --> 01:32:42,183
- Bye-bye!
- Toodles!

1735
01:32:42,267 --> 01:32:45,061
- Well, let's go, Smurfs.
- Bye-bye, Winslows.

1736
01:32:45,145 --> 01:32:48,690
I can't wait to see the rest of my family.

1737
01:32:51,651 --> 01:32:53,653
Bye, Smurfs!

1738
01:33:04,330 --> 01:33:05,957
- Hey, personal space.
- Sorry.

1739
01:33:06,082 --> 01:33:07,417
Papa, you got Smurfette!

1740
01:33:07,792 --> 01:33:09,043
Welcome home, Smurfette!

1741
01:33:09,210 --> 01:33:11,671
- Well, looky here!
- Yeah, we're back!

1742
01:33:11,754 --> 01:33:13,590
- Hi, guys!
- This is good.

1743
01:33:13,673 --> 01:33:15,842
And some new Smurfs for our family.

1744
01:33:15,925 --> 01:33:17,886
Everyone, this is Vexy.

1745
01:33:17,969 --> 01:33:20,722
- Great goobaloo!
- She's a sassy lassie.

1746
01:33:20,805 --> 01:33:21,848
Hi.

1747
01:33:22,015 --> 01:33:23,600
- Hi...
- Hi, I'm Greedy.

1748
01:33:23,683 --> 01:33:26,769
Hi, I'm Greedy. You want
to share a cupcake?

1749
01:33:30,106 --> 01:33:31,608
- Crikey!
- What the hey?

1750
01:33:31,691 --> 01:33:32,901
I nearly smurfed myself.

1751
01:33:33,193 --> 01:33:34,360
Hackus.

1752
01:33:34,444 --> 01:33:36,529
Hackus, these are your new brothers.

1753
01:33:37,030 --> 01:33:38,698
I have new brothers!

1754
01:33:39,032 --> 01:33:40,575
Squeeze!

1755
01:33:40,658 --> 01:33:41,951
Hold on a minute.

1756
01:33:42,035 --> 01:33:43,286
Technically speaking,

1757
01:33:43,369 --> 01:33:46,122
according to section six of the
Smurf Code of Genealogical Legitimacy...

1758
01:33:46,206 --> 01:33:47,749
Hey. Just give him a punt.

1759
01:33:47,832 --> 01:33:49,709
- This creature cannot...
- Hackus punt!

1760
01:33:50,335 --> 01:33:51,920
- Yeah!
- That kid's got style.

1761
01:33:52,003 --> 01:33:53,046
He's one of us.

1762
01:33:54,297 --> 01:33:58,051
And so, after waiting patiently
to be relevant again,

1763
01:33:58,134 --> 01:34:02,388
our heroic Narrator
steps back into his leading role

1764
01:34:02,513 --> 01:34:04,265
to point out that when last we met,

1765
01:34:04,349 --> 01:34:07,393
the entire village was busying itself
with preparations for...

1766
01:34:07,477 --> 01:34:09,312
Hey, what's with all the decorations?

1767
01:34:09,395 --> 01:34:12,857
Happy birthday, Smurfette!

1768
01:34:12,941 --> 01:34:15,902
Do you mind? I'm trying to bookend this.

1769
01:34:15,985 --> 01:34:18,154
- And so...
- Yo, let's kick it.

1770
01:34:18,238 --> 01:34:22,825
...as the music unceremoniously
drowns out the narration...

1771
01:34:23,368 --> 01:34:24,953
This is for my new family.

1772
01:34:50,603 --> 01:34:51,646
Yeah!

1773
01:35:08,538 --> 01:35:10,665
Hey, Hackus, I got you a present.

1774
01:35:10,748 --> 01:35:12,125
Yummy!

1775
01:35:22,593 --> 01:35:24,095
Yeah!

1776
01:35:27,181 --> 01:35:28,391
Hooah!

1777
01:35:47,785 --> 01:35:49,162
Have a nice trip!

1778
01:35:58,963 --> 01:36:00,840
Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no! Stop, stop!

1779
01:36:02,508 --> 01:36:05,386
Help me, Wanda! Help, help me, Wanda!

1780
01:36:08,014 --> 01:36:11,893
And where do you think you're going?
You are coming with me!

1781
01:44:20,172 --> 01:44:23,217
How dare you call me that?
I have bungled nothing!

1782
01:44:24,677 --> 01:44:26,720
Well, Paris is over, my friend.

1783
01:44:26,804 --> 01:44:29,306
We're back here in the Dark Ages.
I suggest you get used to it.

1784
01:44:31,392 --> 01:44:34,353
You want room service?
Why don't you yell out the window?

1785
01:44:36,188 --> 01:44:40,442
Don't you show your claws to me unless you
are prepared to use them, Mr Pussy Foot!

1786
01:44:40,609 --> 01:44:43,862
Pussy foot! Pussy foot! Pussy foot!

1787
01:44:44,071 --> 01:44:46,365
Stop it! Not the face! Not the face!
