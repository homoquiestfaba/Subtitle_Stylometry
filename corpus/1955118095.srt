00:00:10,858 --> 00:00:15,125
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome, Jim Norton!

3
00:00:26,792 --> 00:00:31,056
Thank you!

4
00:00:31,058 --> 00:00:32,658
Thank you!

5
00:00:36,692 --> 00:00:38,325
Thank you, Boston!

6
00:00:41,858 --> 00:00:43,156
I appreciate your coming.

7
00:00:43,158 --> 00:00:44,692
How are you?

8
00:00:47,992 --> 00:00:50,490
Let's be honest, if I
had one ounce of balls,

9
00:00:50,492 --> 00:00:52,790
I would have worn a sweater
and done my entire act

10
00:00:52,792 --> 00:00:54,292
as Bill Cosby!

11
00:00:56,725 --> 00:01:00,192
"Oh, you look a little thirsty..."

12
00:01:04,692 --> 00:01:07,023
A bit of good news for any Cosby fans,

13
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:09,390
he actually does have
a new show coming out,

14
00:01:09,392 --> 00:01:12,225
Women Make The Darnedest Accusations.

15
00:01:17,392 --> 00:01:19,690
I'm going to say one good
thing about Bill Cosby

16
00:01:19,692 --> 00:01:21,290
in this whole scandal,

17
00:01:21,292 --> 00:01:24,756
he has made me realize I am
not nearly as big a pervert

18
00:01:24,758 --> 00:01:26,192
as I thought I was!

19
00:01:27,958 --> 00:01:31,456
I'm a normal, sexually healthy person!

20
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:33,156
Yeah, I like to be spanked,

21
00:01:33,158 --> 00:01:35,625
and if a finger slips in,
I'm not going to be rude.

22
00:01:37,692 --> 00:01:41,192
But if we fuck, I'd like
you to be awake through it!

23
00:01:45,892 --> 00:01:48,456
And if you do fall asleep, I
want it to be out of boredom,

24
00:01:48,458 --> 00:01:50,192
like all the other ones!

25
00:01:51,392 --> 00:01:53,090
What a ghoulish story, man!

26
00:01:53,092 --> 00:01:55,590
I mean, it's really hard for
any of us to kind of fathom

27
00:01:55,592 --> 00:01:57,723
that this guy, who we've
loved for all these years,

28
00:01:57,725 --> 00:01:59,223
could be guilty of this stuff.

29
00:01:59,225 --> 00:02:00,690
And I understand the instinct

30
00:02:00,692 --> 00:02:03,290
to defend somebody who hasn't
been convicted in court.

31
00:02:03,292 --> 00:02:05,290
But there's a lot of accusations.

32
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:08,190
And Phylicia Rashad came
out and defended him,

33
00:02:08,192 --> 00:02:10,990
and it's always interesting
to see the TV wife

34
00:02:10,992 --> 00:02:15,192
defend the TV husband of
real-life rape charges...

35
00:02:16,892 --> 00:02:18,258
because she would know...

36
00:02:19,792 --> 00:02:21,356
Obviously, he would have told her.

37
00:02:21,358 --> 00:02:23,223
She's, like, "I saw him
every Monday morning,

38
00:02:23,225 --> 00:02:25,190
and no, he didn't talk
about that," you know.

39
00:02:25,192 --> 00:02:26,290
"So, what did you do all weekend?"

40
00:02:26,292 --> 00:02:27,123
Like, he was going to go,

41
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:28,390
"I was raping [INAUDIBLE]!

42
00:02:28,392 --> 00:02:33,358
The girl fell asleep, I sucked her toes!"

43
00:02:40,358 --> 00:02:42,556
You know,

44
00:02:42,558 --> 00:02:44,223
people hang onto that, like,

45
00:02:44,225 --> 00:02:46,423
well, you know, these
women are all making it up,

46
00:02:46,425 --> 00:02:48,590
it's a conspiracy, or they
want money, or they want fame.

47
00:02:48,592 --> 00:02:50,923
Okay, maybe a couple of them are.

48
00:02:50,925 --> 00:02:53,223
Ah, but, you know, 20 women?

49
00:02:53,225 --> 00:02:54,490
I mean, over 20.

50
00:02:54,492 --> 00:02:56,592
That's two football teams of women!

51
00:02:58,058 --> 00:03:00,556
That's like if the Cowboys
were playing the Packers,

52
00:03:00,558 --> 00:03:02,490
and they both stopped at the same time,

53
00:03:02,492 --> 00:03:06,192
and looked at the referee, and
said, "Bill Cosby raped me!"

54
00:03:14,025 --> 00:03:15,490
Well, he raped all of us but Romo.

55
00:03:15,492 --> 00:03:16,556
He handed Romo the drink,

56
00:03:16,558 --> 00:03:18,192
and he dropped it!

57
00:03:27,225 --> 00:03:30,223
It's just a lot of people to
be lying about the same thing,

58
00:03:30,225 --> 00:03:31,356
and in the same way.

59
00:03:31,358 --> 00:03:32,890
So, let's play devil's advocate,

60
00:03:32,892 --> 00:03:35,156
I mean, I'll even say, okay,
just to appease those people,

61
00:03:35,158 --> 00:03:36,823
let's say half the women are lying,

62
00:03:36,825 --> 00:03:38,123
which I don't think they are.

63
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:39,856
But let's just say half are lying.

64
00:03:39,858 --> 00:03:44,223
That means he still raped
at least 10 or 11 women.

65
00:03:44,225 --> 00:03:46,625
I don't want to say that's
an impressive number...

66
00:03:48,392 --> 00:03:50,423
Like, you hear that, you never
want someone to see you going,

67
00:03:50,425 --> 00:03:52,823
"Oh..." You know.

68
00:03:52,825 --> 00:03:53,956
But if you're a rapist,

69
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:55,992
you're tipping your cap to Bill Cosby!

70
00:03:57,858 --> 00:04:00,392
He's the Bernie Madoff of rapists!

71
00:04:03,025 --> 00:04:07,156
He never had that
self-hating moment of clarity.

72
00:04:07,158 --> 00:04:10,123
Like, were there no mirrors
in any of these rooms?

73
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:12,290
Like, did he not once look up in the mirror

74
00:04:12,292 --> 00:04:14,825
as he was having sex with a sleeping woman?

75
00:04:28,558 --> 00:04:31,523
How do you keep an erection
after your partner goes

76
00:04:31,525 --> 00:04:38,690
[SNORING SOUND]...?

77
00:04:38,692 --> 00:04:40,823
That moment of self-recognition

78
00:04:40,825 --> 00:04:42,523
and self-hatred is kind of healthy.

79
00:04:42,525 --> 00:04:44,892
I've had that moment alone!

80
00:04:46,925 --> 00:04:48,456
There's been times where I had to power

81
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:51,256
down and turn off and close my laptop,

82
00:04:51,258 --> 00:04:53,758
while I still had cum all over myself!

83
00:04:58,058 --> 00:05:00,123
Because the last thing I need is to trip

84
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:03,525
and kill myself as I'm
duck-walking to the bathroom...

85
00:05:06,758 --> 00:05:09,156
And then the coroner has to
come in, and he backtracks,

86
00:05:09,158 --> 00:05:12,490
and he realizes what I
was watching when I died!

87
00:05:12,492 --> 00:05:14,725
"This was no murder, Sam!"

88
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:26,892
He was masturbating watching
women with male genitals!

89
00:05:31,892 --> 00:05:33,223
You know, it's been kind

90
00:05:33,225 --> 00:05:35,190
of a sad time for comedy,
let's be real honest!

91
00:05:35,192 --> 00:05:37,756
I mean, with our iconic comic heroes,

92
00:05:37,758 --> 00:05:40,056
this horrible thing about Cosby,

93
00:05:40,058 --> 00:05:41,490
you had Robin Williams die,

94
00:05:41,492 --> 00:05:43,290
you had Joan Rivers die.

95
00:05:43,292 --> 00:05:44,690
And it's always interesting
to me when something

96
00:05:44,692 --> 00:05:46,323
very sad like that happens,

97
00:05:46,325 --> 00:05:48,123
the way people react.

98
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:49,690
And inevitably,

99
00:05:49,692 --> 00:05:52,790
there are people who just have
to make it about themselves.

100
00:05:52,792 --> 00:05:54,890
And the day after Robin Williams died,

101
00:05:54,892 --> 00:05:57,056
I was out, and there
were three women talking.

102
00:05:57,058 --> 00:05:58,823
And they were being very nice.

103
00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:01,123
But the one woman was
just making it about her.

104
00:06:01,125 --> 00:06:02,990
And I really wanted to smash her face!

105
00:06:02,992 --> 00:06:05,690
She's a big giant lady,

106
00:06:05,692 --> 00:06:07,490
and she had, like, a
big, wide-brimmed hat.

107
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:10,292
She looked like Brando in
The Island of Dr. Moreau!

108
00:06:12,558 --> 00:06:15,223
And she was just one of these
"it's all about me" people.

109
00:06:15,225 --> 00:06:17,756
She said to her two friends,
she goes, "Oh, my God,

110
00:06:17,758 --> 00:06:19,756
it was so terrible that he did that!

111
00:06:19,758 --> 00:06:22,392
Do you know, he and I
had the same birthday?"

112
00:06:24,058 --> 00:06:24,956
And I wanted

113
00:06:24,958 --> 00:06:25,856
to ask her, "Where do you expect

114
00:06:25,858 --> 00:06:27,690
this discussion to go?"

115
00:06:27,692 --> 00:06:29,190
Like, do people hear that,

116
00:06:29,192 --> 00:06:30,490
and they're supposed to go, "Oh, my God!

117
00:06:30,492 --> 00:06:31,956
I mean, for us, it's going to be hard.

118
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:34,290
But how are YOU going to get through this?

119
00:06:34,292 --> 00:06:36,023
Oh, once a year,

120
00:06:36,025 --> 00:06:39,390
you blow the candles
out, oh, how terrible!"

121
00:06:39,392 --> 00:06:40,690
And then she's naming his movies,

122
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:42,190
but she's getting them all wrong.

123
00:06:42,192 --> 00:06:45,923
She's, like, "Oh, and he
was so good in Good Hunting,

124
00:06:45,925 --> 00:06:50,123
and oh, in Doubtfire, he was so amazing!

125
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:52,390
He was top of the tops!"

126
00:06:52,392 --> 00:06:53,456
And when she said he was

127
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:54,690
"top of the tops,"

128
00:06:54,692 --> 00:06:56,256
I really started to think,

129
00:06:56,258 --> 00:07:00,792
all right, how much time
would I get if I bit her face?

130
00:07:02,992 --> 00:07:04,556
Like, is there a way to
bite her face, and then just

131
00:07:04,558 --> 00:07:06,556
tell the judge, "Your Honor,
she said, 'top of the tops,'

132
00:07:06,558 --> 00:07:08,523
I just saw Cape Fear!

133
00:07:08,525 --> 00:07:09,556
I got you now,

134
00:07:09,558 --> 00:07:11,192
bitch!"

135
00:07:14,492 --> 00:07:15,756
And Joan Rivers sucked,

136
00:07:15,758 --> 00:07:17,456
because it was just so sad for all of us,

137
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:18,790
because it was just so sudden,

138
00:07:18,792 --> 00:07:20,523
you know, and kind of avoidable.

139
00:07:20,525 --> 00:07:22,023
But I guess for her, it's great,

140
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:23,756
because that's the way you want to die.

141
00:07:23,758 --> 00:07:25,156
I want to die like Joan Rivers.

142
00:07:25,158 --> 00:07:28,756
I don't want a long,
drawn-out death, and tributes.

143
00:07:28,758 --> 00:07:31,123
One minute you're here,
the next minute you're gone.

144
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:32,490
You don't some, you know,

145
00:07:32,492 --> 00:07:35,223
terrible sad notes to be
written to your family.

146
00:07:35,225 --> 00:07:36,856
You want your last
thought to be, like, "Wow,

147
00:07:36,858 --> 00:07:38,190
that nurse has weird nipples!"

148
00:07:38,192 --> 00:07:41,725
Gaaahhhhhhhhh!

149
00:07:46,892 --> 00:07:49,690
Joan Rivers was so
under-rated as a comedian,

150
00:07:49,692 --> 00:07:52,556
she really, I think, is the most
under-rated comic of all time.

151
00:07:52,558 --> 00:07:53,690
Because whenever we talk about, like,

152
00:07:53,692 --> 00:07:55,323
the top five or top ten greats,

153
00:07:55,325 --> 00:07:57,690
you always hear, like,
Richard Pryor, George Carlin,

154
00:07:57,692 --> 00:07:58,956
or Cosby, or Lennie Bruce.

155
00:07:58,958 --> 00:08:01,123
You never hear Joan's name mentioned.

156
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:03,190
And I think she was the most brutal...

157
00:08:03,192 --> 00:08:04,823
and I say that with affection...

158
00:08:04,825 --> 00:08:07,190
the most brutal comic I ever saw perform!

159
00:08:07,192 --> 00:08:08,756
She made fun of AIDS,

160
00:08:08,758 --> 00:08:10,523
she made fun of 9-11, I mean,

161
00:08:10,525 --> 00:08:13,392
recently she called
Michelle Obama a "trannie!"

162
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:18,192
I'd be scared to text that to somebody!

163
00:08:20,858 --> 00:08:23,056
And when they asked her about
it, expecting an apology,

164
00:08:23,058 --> 00:08:23,856
like, "Why did you say that?" She's,

165
00:08:23,858 --> 00:08:25,558
like, "Oh! Look at her!"

166
00:08:28,158 --> 00:08:29,823
Joan Rivers was wonderful!

167
00:08:29,825 --> 00:08:32,458
I would have eaten her pussy
10 minutes after she died!

168
00:08:33,758 --> 00:08:36,192
God bless Joan Rivers!

169
00:08:43,192 --> 00:08:44,990
Because she never gave
them what they wanted!

170
00:08:44,992 --> 00:08:46,523
She never said she was sorry.

171
00:08:46,525 --> 00:08:49,223
She was more fearless than
any comic, she really was.

172
00:08:49,225 --> 00:08:51,356
Because they were always
trying to get her to apologize!

173
00:08:51,358 --> 00:08:53,490
And in this era, man, that's what they do!

174
00:08:53,492 --> 00:08:55,223
They catch you saying something,

175
00:08:55,225 --> 00:08:57,690
and they hound you until
you say you're sorry.

176
00:08:57,692 --> 00:08:59,223
And it seems like contextually,

177
00:08:59,225 --> 00:09:01,023
it doesn't matter what the situation is.

178
00:09:01,025 --> 00:09:02,956
Like, look what happened to Jonah Hill.

179
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:05,090
Jonah's a nice guy, he's not a homophobe.

180
00:09:05,092 --> 00:09:06,923
He's being stalked by the Paparazzi,

181
00:09:06,925 --> 00:09:08,423
the guy's hassling him,

182
00:09:08,425 --> 00:09:12,756
and in one stupid moment, Jonah
Hill uses an anti-gay slur,

183
00:09:12,758 --> 00:09:13,756
and they come right after him.

184
00:09:13,758 --> 00:09:15,356
"He's a homophobe!"

185
00:09:15,358 --> 00:09:16,790
And he wasn't.

186
00:09:16,792 --> 00:09:18,423
The guy was all over him,
and Jonah Hill just kind of,

187
00:09:18,425 --> 00:09:20,290
like, "Suck my dick, faggot!"

188
00:09:20,292 --> 00:09:21,756
Like, all right, that's not a nice thing

189
00:09:21,758 --> 00:09:24,223
to say if you yell it at a guy

190
00:09:24,225 --> 00:09:26,292
because he's taking too
long making your cappuccino.

191
00:09:27,592 --> 00:09:30,056
Fair enough. You owe an
apology if you're in Starbuck's,

192
00:09:30,058 --> 00:09:31,423
and you're, like, "Suck my dick, faggot!"

193
00:09:31,425 --> 00:09:42,890
[NOISE]

194
00:09:42,892 --> 00:09:44,290
But it seems like we're now

195
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:46,323
judged out of what we
say and not what we do,

196
00:09:46,325 --> 00:09:48,756
because nobody penalizes the Paparazzi!

197
00:09:48,758 --> 00:09:51,056
As a kid, you were always taught
what you say is irrelevant,

198
00:09:51,058 --> 00:09:52,790
your actions are all that matters.

199
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:53,990
And now we've turned upside down,

200
00:09:53,992 --> 00:09:55,556
and we're just the opposite way.

201
00:09:55,558 --> 00:09:57,856
Look at one of my closest
friends, Anthony Cumia.

202
00:09:57,858 --> 00:09:59,558
Look what happened to Anthony Cumia!

203
00:10:13,492 --> 00:10:15,490
And you all know Anthony.

204
00:10:15,492 --> 00:10:17,356
For many, many years, you know,

205
00:10:17,358 --> 00:10:20,490
the show was the Opie and
Anthony Show that I was on,

206
00:10:20,492 --> 00:10:25,025
and Anthony, look, comic genius,
bit of a volatile personality!

207
00:10:30,725 --> 00:10:33,323
But, what happened, if
anybody's not familiar with it,

208
00:10:33,325 --> 00:10:34,790
the reason I'm talking about it

209
00:10:34,792 --> 00:10:38,156
is because Anthony was assaulted
in Times Square one night.

210
00:10:38,158 --> 00:10:40,156
He was punched in the
face by a black woman,

211
00:10:40,158 --> 00:10:41,790
and he went on Twitter
and said some racially

212
00:10:41,792 --> 00:10:43,523
insensitive things.

213
00:10:43,525 --> 00:10:45,790
And people thought she
might have been a hooker,

214
00:10:45,792 --> 00:10:48,123
but I don't know if you saw a
photo that he tweeted of her,

215
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:51,656
she was NOT a hooker.

216
00:10:51,658 --> 00:10:54,325
She looked like the boat
captain in Apocalypse Now!

217
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:01,556
And Anthony had this camera,

218
00:11:01,558 --> 00:11:03,523
a lot of people thought
maybe he was being creepy.

219
00:11:03,525 --> 00:11:06,156
He had this camera for
about a year in studio,

220
00:11:06,158 --> 00:11:07,823
and he had become
obsessed with photography.

221
00:11:07,825 --> 00:11:09,756
He was photographing everything.

222
00:11:09,758 --> 00:11:11,490
And that's just what
happens when you hit 50,

223
00:11:11,492 --> 00:11:13,192
and you have no love, or children.

224
00:11:14,892 --> 00:11:16,756
You photograph things,
just so you have something

225
00:11:16,758 --> 00:11:19,123
to show people when they come to the house,

226
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:21,858
other than empty beer cans
and Xanax prescriptions!

227
00:11:24,858 --> 00:11:27,290
And I'm not knocking Anthony, I'm 46,

228
00:11:27,292 --> 00:11:28,456
and I'm eyeing up cameras.

229
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:30,225
I'm right behind him!

230
00:11:31,825 --> 00:11:33,323
But he photographed...

231
00:11:33,325 --> 00:11:34,690
this black woman was walking,

232
00:11:34,692 --> 00:11:36,456
and she was in the photo.

233
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:38,756
And I guess she might have
thought he was being creepy.

234
00:11:38,758 --> 00:11:40,756
I don't know what her situation was.

235
00:11:40,758 --> 00:11:43,556
But she came back, and she's,
like, "You white mother fucker!"

236
00:11:43,558 --> 00:11:44,956
And she belted him in the face

237
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:46,590
about 10 times!

238
00:11:46,592 --> 00:11:48,923
And Anthony didn't hit her back.

239
00:11:48,925 --> 00:11:51,323
He went home, and I guess he thawed out,

240
00:11:51,325 --> 00:11:53,956
like, sometimes an assault, you
thaw out after a little while.

241
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:55,290
And he went on Twitter,

242
00:11:55,292 --> 00:11:57,456
and, you know, he kind
of went on a rampage.

243
00:11:57,458 --> 00:12:01,123
And he said some shit that I
wish he would have rephrased.

244
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:02,856
Like, I wish he would have called me first

245
00:12:02,858 --> 00:12:03,823
and run them by me, I
would have been, like,

246
00:12:03,825 --> 00:12:05,223
"That's fine, that's fine, no!

247
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:06,690
That's fine, that's fine, no!

248
00:12:06,692 --> 00:12:08,858
No, no, no, no! Put that
one there, trust me!"

249
00:12:10,992 --> 00:12:12,390
But they fired him,

250
00:12:12,392 --> 00:12:14,523
and it was so horrible that they fired him!

251
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:15,956
First, and most importantly,

252
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:18,290
they robbed me of the opportunity

253
00:12:18,292 --> 00:12:21,023
to tease my friend by getting
his ass kicked by Madea.

254
00:12:21,025 --> 00:12:22,458
Do you have any idea...

255
00:12:24,292 --> 00:12:27,156
forever I could have made fun of him!

256
00:12:27,158 --> 00:12:29,290
Every day, I would have
walked in and held up a picture

257
00:12:29,292 --> 00:12:31,690
of a different black woman!

258
00:12:31,692 --> 00:12:32,956
Oprah Winfrey, "Duck, Anthony!

259
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:34,492
Careful!"

260
00:12:40,692 --> 00:12:42,323
And, you know, the problem was,

261
00:12:42,325 --> 00:12:43,856
the press just ran with it.

262
00:12:43,858 --> 00:12:45,156
And they were so predictable.

263
00:12:45,158 --> 00:12:47,090
They always take the easy narrative.

264
00:12:47,092 --> 00:12:48,690
Like, I wish for once,

265
00:12:48,692 --> 00:12:50,823
they would really just go the extra mile

266
00:12:50,825 --> 00:12:52,756
and take the proper angle
on it, because, you know,

267
00:12:52,758 --> 00:12:53,890
the big story is, "Shock

268
00:12:53,892 --> 00:12:56,756
jock says inappropriate things!"

269
00:12:56,758 --> 00:12:58,490
How about the story being,

270
00:12:58,492 --> 00:13:00,523
"Shock jock is assaulted,

271
00:13:00,525 --> 00:13:02,290
but reacts non-violently."

272
00:13:02,292 --> 00:13:06,123
Why wasn't the non-violent
reaction part of the story?

273
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:13,690
You don't have to like what Anthony said.

274
00:13:13,692 --> 00:13:15,290
You don't have to agree with what he said.

275
00:13:15,292 --> 00:13:17,356
But you do have to respect
the fact that he didn't punch

276
00:13:17,358 --> 00:13:18,856
this woman in the face,

277
00:13:18,858 --> 00:13:22,156
nor did he pull out the gun
that he has on him at all times!

278
00:13:22,158 --> 00:13:23,190
And he shouldn't have.

279
00:13:23,192 --> 00:13:24,390
He shouldn't have pulled his gun.

280
00:13:24,392 --> 00:13:26,156
But he didn't.

281
00:13:26,158 --> 00:13:29,456
And Anthony's one of those guys
who's armed all the time, like,

282
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:30,990
I've been at his house 3:00 in the morning,

283
00:13:30,992 --> 00:13:34,390
he'll be in his underpants with just a gun.

284
00:13:34,392 --> 00:13:36,023
If you look through the window,
you'd think he was either,

285
00:13:36,025 --> 00:13:37,856
like, a tall six-year-old
playing sheriff,

286
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:40,192
or a man who's mentally ill!

287
00:13:46,758 --> 00:13:49,756
I have been in his Jacuzzi
with him at 3:00 in the morning,

288
00:13:49,758 --> 00:13:51,625
just me and him... as friends...

289
00:13:53,992 --> 00:13:57,290
and he has a gun within arm's distance,

290
00:13:57,292 --> 00:13:59,290
outside of the Jacuzzi.

291
00:13:59,292 --> 00:14:00,756
And at one point I said
to him, like, "Dude,

292
00:14:00,758 --> 00:14:04,290
is something going to happen
here that I'm not aware?

293
00:14:04,292 --> 00:14:05,690
Like, you know, are you
going to all of a sudden point

294
00:14:05,692 --> 00:14:07,356
that at me?" And,

295
00:14:07,358 --> 00:14:09,223
I'm, like...

296
00:14:09,225 --> 00:14:17,356
[gurgling sound] My head's
going to pop out of the water,

297
00:14:17,358 --> 00:14:18,890
I'm going to hear the Cosby theme song

298
00:14:18,892 --> 00:14:20,458
coming out of the house?

299
00:14:24,692 --> 00:14:26,156
Because I do think the fact

300
00:14:26,158 --> 00:14:28,490
that he behaved responsibly
as a gun owner is worth noting.

301
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:30,190
Because I'm telling you very honestly,

302
00:14:30,192 --> 00:14:33,956
if I had a gun, that woman
would have gotten shot!

303
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:35,890
But not out of being a tough guy,

304
00:14:35,892 --> 00:14:37,956
or being angry, I would have panicked,

305
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:40,356
because I can't fight for shit!

306
00:14:40,358 --> 00:14:42,756
And any woman that walks up
to a guy at 3:00 in the morning

307
00:14:42,758 --> 00:14:43,790
and goes, "You white mother fucker,"

308
00:14:43,792 --> 00:14:45,690
and punches him probably

309
00:14:45,692 --> 00:14:47,323
could kick the shit out of me!

310
00:14:47,325 --> 00:14:49,423
So I guarantee you, if she hit me once,

311
00:14:49,425 --> 00:14:51,056
I would have pointed the
gun at her in a panic,

312
00:14:51,058 --> 00:14:52,823
"Get away from me, madam!"

313
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:55,058
And I would have shot her 30 to 40 times!

314
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:58,723
And putting it away, I would have panicked,

315
00:14:58,725 --> 00:15:01,492
and shot myself, like Plaxico Burress!

316
00:15:03,192 --> 00:15:04,690
Then I would have went home on Twitter

317
00:15:04,692 --> 00:15:06,625
and blamed the Puerto Ricans!

318
00:15:09,392 --> 00:15:11,756
You know, gun ownership's
a big responsibility.

319
00:15:11,758 --> 00:15:13,823
Like, I don't think I'm the
right mentality to have one.

320
00:15:13,825 --> 00:15:15,323
Like, I've been dying to get one.

321
00:15:15,325 --> 00:15:17,290
And it's not even to shoot people, I just

322
00:15:17,292 --> 00:15:20,190
want one for those annoying
day to day interactions,

323
00:15:20,192 --> 00:15:26,192
like... do you ever go to
return an item with no receipt?

324
00:15:27,692 --> 00:15:30,523
How great would a gun be at those moments?

325
00:15:30,525 --> 00:15:32,490
You don't have to brandish it, just quietly

326
00:15:32,492 --> 00:15:34,890
put it on the counter.

327
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:36,023
"Do you have a receipt?"

328
00:15:36,025 --> 00:15:38,192
I don't know, do I?

329
00:15:49,592 --> 00:15:51,690
And the thing you got
to be careful about is,

330
00:15:51,692 --> 00:15:52,790
you never know who's armed.

331
00:15:52,792 --> 00:15:54,290
Like, Anthony behaved responsibly.

332
00:15:54,292 --> 00:15:55,556
But not everybody does.

333
00:15:55,558 --> 00:15:56,923
There was a guy in Florida shot

334
00:15:56,925 --> 00:15:59,756
and killed for texting in a movie theater!

335
00:15:59,758 --> 00:16:01,323
Now, obviously, you hear that,

336
00:16:01,325 --> 00:16:02,692
you have mixed feelings...

337
00:16:06,025 --> 00:16:07,223
That's one of those stories
you hear, you're like, oh!

338
00:16:07,225 --> 00:16:09,325
Ahhh...

339
00:16:13,225 --> 00:16:16,156
And the guy who got shot
was in his 30s, and the guy

340
00:16:16,158 --> 00:16:19,990
who killed him was a 71-year-old
retired police captain.

341
00:16:19,992 --> 00:16:22,523
You can't find a crankier human being

342
00:16:22,525 --> 00:16:24,223
than a
71-year-old...

343
00:16:24,225 --> 00:16:26,292
"I got all you guinea hoods locked up!"

344
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:31,690
And I'm not saying the young
guy deserved to get shot,

345
00:16:31,692 --> 00:16:33,690
but I think he read the situation wrong,

346
00:16:33,692 --> 00:16:35,290
because they started to argue,

347
00:16:35,292 --> 00:16:36,856
and it got very, very heated.

348
00:16:36,858 --> 00:16:38,356
Now, first of all, in
fairness to the old guy,

349
00:16:38,358 --> 00:16:39,990
old people sucked with technology.

350
00:16:39,992 --> 00:16:42,323
He probably had no idea, he
saw the glow of the cellphone,

351
00:16:42,325 --> 00:16:43,956
and, "The man's got plutonium!"

352
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:46,492
And panicked, and shot his pants!

353
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:51,556
But they started arguing,

354
00:16:51,558 --> 00:16:54,456
and it got very heated,
then the old guy shot him.

355
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:55,990
If you're in your 30s,

356
00:16:55,992 --> 00:16:59,023
and you're having a really nasty
argument with a very old man,

357
00:16:59,025 --> 00:17:00,890
and the old man's not backing off,

358
00:17:00,892 --> 00:17:03,523
find out what he used to do for a living!

359
00:17:03,525 --> 00:17:05,523
Because there's a reason
he's not backing off!

360
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:07,323
So, at one point, just go,
like, "What did you used to do?"

361
00:17:07,325 --> 00:17:08,690
And if he's, like, "I was a baker!"

362
00:17:08,692 --> 00:17:10,392
Then kick the shit out of him!

363
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:14,990
But if he says, "I was
a police officer!" Say,

364
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:17,558
"Thank you for your service!"

365
00:17:25,792 --> 00:17:27,990
And another thing that should
have tipped the young guy

366
00:17:27,992 --> 00:17:29,456
off is, they were both
there with their wives.

367
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:31,956
You don't argue with a man who's that old

368
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:33,123
if he's with his wife,

369
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:35,856
because that guy's been
married a long time,

370
00:17:35,858 --> 00:17:38,192
he's looking for a way out!

371
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:42,456
Shooting you does not
represent dying alone in prison;

372
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:47,058
it represents a 30-year vacation
with better food and more sex!

373
00:17:54,792 --> 00:17:56,890
I'll tell you what
really scares me, though.

374
00:17:56,892 --> 00:17:58,823
It's not necessarily the random shootings,

375
00:17:58,825 --> 00:18:00,356
because those are very rare,

376
00:18:00,358 --> 00:18:02,756
and you can't live life
being afraid of that.

377
00:18:02,758 --> 00:18:04,956
It's the workplace shootings, because those

378
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,290
do not feel random.

379
00:18:06,292 --> 00:18:08,223
You always see those coming.

380
00:18:08,225 --> 00:18:11,056
So, there's, like, an
anticipation before it happens.

381
00:18:11,058 --> 00:18:14,456
Because it's always that
one fucking nut on the job,

382
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:17,190
you know what I mean, who
slowly descends into being crazy.

383
00:18:17,192 --> 00:18:20,123
Because no one goes on a
rampage the day they get hired.

384
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:21,690
You know, it's never,
like, "Welcome aboard!

385
00:18:21,692 --> 00:18:23,390
Let me show you where the break
room is." "I'll never need it!"

386
00:18:23,392 --> 00:18:28,356
You know. Oh! By the way,

387
00:18:28,358 --> 00:18:30,456
was that the worst impression
ever of pulling a gun?

388
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:31,992
Who the fuck draws, like...

389
00:18:33,225 --> 00:18:35,756
If I ever wonder why I don't
get acting work, remind me of,

390
00:18:35,758 --> 00:18:37,690
you know, "All right, Jim,
you're a bank robber," okay,

391
00:18:37,692 --> 00:18:40,690
"Give me your money, see?" Cut!

392
00:18:40,692 --> 00:18:42,192
What the fuck are you doing?"

393
00:18:47,058 --> 00:18:48,790
It's always one of those guys

394
00:18:48,792 --> 00:18:50,823
that people start
talking about for a month,

395
00:18:50,825 --> 00:18:53,956
like, "I think there's
something wrong with Bill!

396
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:56,292
"What do you mean?" He
holds his pen like this!

397
00:18:58,392 --> 00:19:03,756
He writes, 'JEWS' in capital letters...

398
00:19:03,758 --> 00:19:05,790
"And you watch those
post-shooting interviews,

399
00:19:05,792 --> 00:19:08,756
they're never shocked
by who the shooter is!"

400
00:19:08,758 --> 00:19:10,090
Were you surprised Bill

401
00:19:10,092 --> 00:19:12,058
went on a rampage? "Oh, no, not at all!

402
00:19:13,192 --> 00:19:14,123
We knew Bill was going

403
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:15,692
to kill all of us!

404
00:19:16,858 --> 00:19:18,056
"How did you know?" Well,

405
00:19:18,058 --> 00:19:20,756
he'd say, 'I'm going to kill all of you!'

406
00:19:20,758 --> 00:19:22,056
And then he'd spit in our food

407
00:19:22,058 --> 00:19:24,123
and walk out of the break room!

408
00:19:24,125 --> 00:19:25,456
We tried to have him fired,

409
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:26,756
but he's one quarter Native American.

410
00:19:26,758 --> 00:19:28,758
It was a Human Resources issue!"

411
00:19:32,758 --> 00:19:34,290
But it's so interesting to me

412
00:19:34,292 --> 00:19:35,590
too, because I think by
this point in your life,

413
00:19:35,592 --> 00:19:37,223
you know, what a gunshot sounds like.

414
00:19:37,225 --> 00:19:39,056
We've all heard them or
seen them in the movies

415
00:19:39,058 --> 00:19:40,590
or on television, and yet,

416
00:19:40,592 --> 00:19:43,423
they never think that's what
it is the day of the shooting.

417
00:19:43,425 --> 00:19:45,556
I don't know what it is, but the
interviews are always the same.

418
00:19:45,558 --> 00:19:47,323
It's, like, "Well, I was at my desk,

419
00:19:47,325 --> 00:19:48,956
and I heard, pop pop pop,

420
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:51,990
pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop!

421
00:19:51,992 --> 00:19:54,192
And I thought it was firecrackers!

422
00:19:55,825 --> 00:19:58,223
So, I went out into the hallway,

423
00:19:58,225 --> 00:20:00,025
and it was Bill.

424
00:20:01,558 --> 00:20:03,390
And he was wearing Army fatigues,

425
00:20:03,392 --> 00:20:07,125
which I thought was odd,
because he's an attorney.

426
00:20:08,825 --> 00:20:10,890
And he was pointing something at people

427
00:20:10,892 --> 00:20:14,158
who were sleeping on the floor,
with cranberry sauce on them!

428
00:20:16,158 --> 00:20:22,790
I said, 'Bill, what are you doing, Bill?'"

429
00:20:22,792 --> 00:20:24,190
Like, I understand you're in shock,

430
00:20:24,192 --> 00:20:26,890
but Jesus, fucking firecrackers?

431
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,223
When was the last time you had your workday

432
00:20:28,225 --> 00:20:30,990
disrupted by fireworks?

433
00:20:30,992 --> 00:20:32,956
We saw that story on the news,

434
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:34,356
it was, like, "Well, I was
at my desk, and I heard,

435
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:36,223
pop, pop, pop, pop, pop!" "What happened?"

436
00:20:36,225 --> 00:20:38,158
"Edna turned 75!

437
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:43,223
We threw firecrackers into the office,

438
00:20:43,225 --> 00:20:46,590
and she screamed because
she broke her femur,

439
00:20:46,592 --> 00:20:48,425
jumping up in happiness!"

440
00:20:49,558 --> 00:20:50,923
"What was all the, 'Help,

441
00:20:50,925 --> 00:20:52,556
help'?"Oh, nothing,

442
00:20:52,558 --> 00:20:54,892
we're just going to teabag her
until the ambulance gets here!"

443
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:07,023
But you sense that kind
of stuff off people.

444
00:21:07,025 --> 00:21:09,123
And we're taught to ignore that,

445
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:12,056
because it's not social
polite to prejudge people.

446
00:21:12,058 --> 00:21:14,490
But I think that we all
connect on some weird level

447
00:21:14,492 --> 00:21:15,990
that's inexplicable.

448
00:21:15,992 --> 00:21:17,990
Like, I had a weird moment when I was in

449
00:21:17,992 --> 00:21:20,223
Washington, D.C. recently, in my hotel.

450
00:21:20,225 --> 00:21:22,190
And this is not, like, an
ominous or threatening thing,

451
00:21:22,192 --> 00:21:25,456
it was just a weird,
connecting, uncomfortable moment.

452
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:27,490
I was in the elevator
with three other guys,

453
00:21:27,492 --> 00:21:29,156
and we were all strangers to each other,

454
00:21:29,158 --> 00:21:30,790
four total strangers.

455
00:21:30,792 --> 00:21:32,356
And a woman steps on the elevator,

456
00:21:32,358 --> 00:21:34,056
before the doors close.

457
00:21:34,058 --> 00:21:35,756
And she starts to talk to one of the guys.

458
00:21:35,758 --> 00:21:37,490
And she goes, "Hey, I
just started working here,

459
00:21:37,492 --> 00:21:40,356
is there anything I can do
to make your stay better?"

460
00:21:40,358 --> 00:21:41,890
And when she said that,

461
00:21:41,892 --> 00:21:44,556
of course, I had a couple
of things come to...

462
00:21:44,558 --> 00:21:46,790
you know, but I figure it was
just too awkward to blurt out.

463
00:21:46,792 --> 00:21:48,392
"You could eat my ass," you
know, I just figured that's...

464
00:21:49,692 --> 00:21:50,490
because if that doesn't get a laugh,

465
00:21:50,492 --> 00:21:52,690
that's an ugly elevator ride!

466
00:21:52,692 --> 00:21:54,558
"What?" Oh, I was just...

467
00:21:57,858 --> 00:21:59,156
"So, nobody said anything.

468
00:21:59,158 --> 00:22:01,156
And she got off about three floors later.

469
00:22:01,158 --> 00:22:02,890
And then there was an uncomfortable silence

470
00:22:02,892 --> 00:22:05,756
between the four of us
guys that were remaining.

471
00:22:05,758 --> 00:22:07,856
And one guy finally couldn't hold it in.

472
00:22:07,858 --> 00:22:09,856
And he just blurts out, he goes,

473
00:22:09,858 --> 00:22:11,290
"Damn, there was a few things I

474
00:22:11,292 --> 00:22:13,756
wanted to tell her she could
do to make my stay better!"

475
00:22:13,758 --> 00:22:15,490
And the other two guys

476
00:22:15,492 --> 00:22:16,823
were, like, "Yeah, I was
thinking the same thing!"

477
00:22:16,825 --> 00:22:19,823
And then finally, pussy-boy,
Jim goes, "Yeah, me too, guys!

478
00:22:19,825 --> 00:22:22,690
I was thinking the same thing!"

479
00:22:22,692 --> 00:22:24,290
But then, I just kind of creeped

480
00:22:24,292 --> 00:22:26,492
everybody out, "She could have
eaten all our asses, right guys?

481
00:22:28,392 --> 00:22:29,992
And then we could have killed her, huh?"

482
00:22:36,692 --> 00:22:38,690
Now, that's not an ominous or scary thing,

483
00:22:38,692 --> 00:22:40,356
but the interesting thing

484
00:22:40,358 --> 00:22:45,056
to me was that four absolute
strangers, independently,

485
00:22:45,058 --> 00:22:48,423
came to the exact same wrong conclusion!

486
00:22:48,425 --> 00:22:49,923
Because she was not being flirtatious,

487
00:22:49,925 --> 00:22:52,423
she wasn't being sexual, she was dressed,

488
00:22:52,425 --> 00:22:53,590
you know, very professionally.

489
00:22:53,592 --> 00:22:55,090
Just trying to be nice.

490
00:22:55,092 --> 00:22:56,156
"Is there anything I can do to help..."

491
00:22:56,158 --> 00:22:58,223
We're all, like, "Yeah...

492
00:22:58,225 --> 00:22:59,825
grrrrr!"

493
00:23:04,358 --> 00:23:07,556
Now, you probably attribute that
to collective male immaturity.

494
00:23:07,558 --> 00:23:09,856
I think that's male immaturity,
to be very honest with you.

495
00:23:09,858 --> 00:23:11,890
Because from my hotel window,

496
00:23:11,892 --> 00:23:13,490
I could see the Washington Monument.

497
00:23:13,492 --> 00:23:16,523
I spent an hour staring
at the Washington Monument

498
00:23:16,525 --> 00:23:18,458
holding up two apples,

499
00:23:20,758 --> 00:23:22,992
trying to snap a photo...

500
00:23:32,558 --> 00:23:35,823
Because to every guy I know,
me licking a 500-foot dick

501
00:23:35,825 --> 00:23:37,392
is hilarious!

502
00:23:40,825 --> 00:23:44,756
It's a really weird time
for us culturally, isn't it?

503
00:23:44,758 --> 00:23:47,256
It just seems like we're kind of adjusting

504
00:23:47,258 --> 00:23:50,290
to all the new technology
and the instant communication.

505
00:23:50,292 --> 00:23:53,156
And as a result of that, a lot
of us are getting in trouble.

506
00:23:53,158 --> 00:23:54,556
And you know, it's not
even for things like,

507
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:55,923
Jonah Hill had the outburst,

508
00:23:55,925 --> 00:23:57,323
or Anthony for what he said on Twitter.

509
00:23:57,325 --> 00:23:58,356
People are getting in trouble for what

510
00:23:58,358 --> 00:23:59,956
they said a long time ago!

511
00:23:59,958 --> 00:24:01,356
I mean, look at Paula Deen,

512
00:24:01,358 --> 00:24:03,690
and her... and by the way,
the Paula Deen outrage,

513
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:04,890
you've got to be very careful,

514
00:24:04,892 --> 00:24:07,823
because talking about race
gets people in trouble.

515
00:24:07,825 --> 00:24:10,292
Talking about race gets
white people in trouble.

516
00:24:20,758 --> 00:24:23,023
And by the way, that's
not black people's fault,

517
00:24:23,025 --> 00:24:24,856
that's white people's fault.

518
00:24:24,858 --> 00:24:26,390
Because, you know, most white people...

519
00:24:26,392 --> 00:24:27,690
I can't say all white people...

520
00:24:27,692 --> 00:24:28,523
but a lot of white people,

521
00:24:28,525 --> 00:24:29,690
whey they deal with race,

522
00:24:29,692 --> 00:24:30,690
they don't deal with race.

523
00:24:30,692 --> 00:24:32,523
Their idea of addressing racism

524
00:24:32,525 --> 00:24:34,990
is just finding other white
people to throw under the bus

525
00:24:34,992 --> 00:24:37,223
so they don't look particularly bad.

526
00:24:37,225 --> 00:24:39,823
Because black people didn't
give a shit about Paula Deen.

527
00:24:39,825 --> 00:24:41,690
That was a bunch of fake white people

528
00:24:41,692 --> 00:24:46,458
going, "Could you believe
she said the 'n' word?" Yes!

529
00:24:47,925 --> 00:24:50,292
She's almost 70, from Georgia!

530
00:24:52,325 --> 00:24:55,425
I'm impressed she doesn't have
it tattooed on her knuckles!

531
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:04,223
Because all white people
want our black friends to know

532
00:25:04,225 --> 00:25:06,823
we're not racist, but it's an
awkward conversation to have.

533
00:25:06,825 --> 00:25:09,156
You can't just walk up to your
black friends for no reason

534
00:25:09,158 --> 00:25:12,192
and go, "Hey, hey, hey,
hey, I don't say, 'nigger'!

535
00:25:20,192 --> 00:25:22,558
But I can show you someone who does!"

536
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:29,690
And it was also, by the way,

537
00:25:29,692 --> 00:25:31,356
something she said 35 years ago.

538
00:25:31,358 --> 00:25:32,790
Thirty-five...

539
00:25:32,792 --> 00:25:34,690
that was embarrassing to me as an American.

540
00:25:34,692 --> 00:25:38,056
We're going to go into each
other's pasts, 35 years,

541
00:25:38,058 --> 00:25:39,823
and find little things we...

542
00:25:39,825 --> 00:25:42,456
it's not like she was
driving down the street now

543
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:43,690
with a GoPro hooked up

544
00:25:43,692 --> 00:25:44,756
and a bullhorn, just yellowing,

545
00:25:44,758 --> 00:25:46,556
"Attention, you at the bus stop,

546
00:25:46,558 --> 00:25:48,192
with the matching hat
and shoes," you know...

547
00:25:55,058 --> 00:25:57,056
And it was, like, it
kind of made me cringe.

548
00:25:57,058 --> 00:25:59,556
I'm, like, are we really going
to go over somebody's history?

549
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:00,856
Can any of us withstand

550
00:26:00,858 --> 00:26:03,323
that scrutiny of having
our whole lives opened up?

551
00:26:03,325 --> 00:26:05,190
Can anybody say we've
never said anything racist?

552
00:26:05,192 --> 00:26:06,356
Like, not once?

553
00:26:06,358 --> 00:26:08,223
You know, you never got
cut off by an Asian guy

554
00:26:08,225 --> 00:26:13,156
and said, "Of course!" Never?

555
00:26:13,158 --> 00:26:15,123
Like, you never saw a
Jew picking up a penny

556
00:26:15,125 --> 00:26:18,025
and tried to sneak a photo
with your iPhone really fast?

557
00:26:20,058 --> 00:26:21,356
Good luck, they're hard to get!

558
00:26:21,358 --> 00:26:24,990
They're very fast!
You'll never get that one!

559
00:26:24,992 --> 00:26:27,356
You just got a sleeve, coming backwards,

560
00:26:27,358 --> 00:26:29,456
you know...

561
00:26:29,458 --> 00:26:30,756
But it annoyed me so much,

562
00:26:30,758 --> 00:26:32,156
because it was so fake.

563
00:26:32,158 --> 00:26:34,323
It was just a chance for people to use her

564
00:26:34,325 --> 00:26:37,456
to show everyone how wonderful
and progressive they are.

565
00:26:37,458 --> 00:26:38,990
So, I was on Twitter.

566
00:26:38,992 --> 00:26:40,456
And I like Twitter, it's a great place

567
00:26:40,458 --> 00:26:42,192
to have a rational discussion.

568
00:26:43,892 --> 00:26:45,456
And I was making fun

569
00:26:45,458 --> 00:26:47,956
of all the fake outrage about Paula Deen.

570
00:26:47,958 --> 00:26:50,490
I also wanted to bash Paula
Deen. I don't hate her.

571
00:26:50,492 --> 00:26:52,090
I thought she was great in Total Recall

572
00:26:52,092 --> 00:26:54,092
when her head came apart in the airport.

573
00:26:59,792 --> 00:27:01,390
But I don't particularly like her.

574
00:27:01,392 --> 00:27:02,956
So, at one point,

575
00:27:02,958 --> 00:27:05,023
after I made fun of all the fake outrage,

576
00:27:05,025 --> 00:27:07,223
I tweeted, "By the way,
just for the record,

577
00:27:07,225 --> 00:27:12,290
I do think that Paula Deen
is a fat, irritating cunt!"

578
00:27:12,292 --> 00:27:13,790
Now, I know that sounds really harsh,

579
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:15,323
but I put a little winky face and a smile.

580
00:27:15,325 --> 00:27:17,192
It was cute!

581
00:27:19,125 --> 00:27:21,456
And you know, you can never give
a shit if somebody gets upset,

582
00:27:21,458 --> 00:27:22,756
because no matter what you say publicly,

583
00:27:22,758 --> 00:27:23,956
there's always one person

584
00:27:23,958 --> 00:27:25,690
who wants to step in the line of fire

585
00:27:25,692 --> 00:27:27,123
on purpose, just to get upset,

586
00:27:27,125 --> 00:27:29,056
so they get a little
attention for themselves.

587
00:27:29,058 --> 00:27:30,790
So, this big fat lady on Twitter

588
00:27:30,792 --> 00:27:33,756
gets mad at me because
I used the word, "fat."

589
00:27:33,758 --> 00:27:34,990
She's, like, "Oh, Jim Norton"...

590
00:27:34,992 --> 00:27:36,690
it's, like, first of all, the word

591
00:27:36,692 --> 00:27:40,123
"fat" there was not meant
to attack fat people at all.

592
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:42,556
I was simply using the word "fat"

593
00:27:42,558 --> 00:27:45,490
as kind of a gateway
insult to get to "cunt."

594
00:27:45,492 --> 00:27:47,923
That's all I was doing!

595
00:27:47,925 --> 00:27:49,990
"Cunt" is obviously the point,

596
00:27:49,992 --> 00:27:51,290
but you can't have "cunt" in the middle,

597
00:27:51,292 --> 00:27:53,223
because nothing follows it!

598
00:27:53,225 --> 00:27:54,923
"Cunt" has to be...

599
00:27:54,925 --> 00:27:57,056
"cunt" is not the single
in the third inning,

600
00:27:57,058 --> 00:27:58,690
"cunt" is the walk-off home run

601
00:27:58,692 --> 00:28:00,192
in the bottom of the 11th!

602
00:28:06,058 --> 00:28:07,690
You know what you say after "cunt?"

603
00:28:07,692 --> 00:28:10,858
Ta daaa! That's what you say!

604
00:28:13,892 --> 00:28:16,756
So, this woman gets really mad
at me, and she @-mentions me,

605
00:28:16,758 --> 00:28:19,556
and she goes, "Oh, now
Jim Norton is fat-shaming!"

606
00:28:19,558 --> 00:28:22,490
Unfollow!

607
00:28:22,492 --> 00:28:26,890
Oh! First of all, are you
sure you're not unfollowing me

608
00:28:26,892 --> 00:28:29,025
because I'm walking quickly?

609
00:28:32,525 --> 00:28:34,990
And second of all, can we stop
with the victimizing terms,

610
00:28:34,992 --> 00:28:36,556
like, "fat-shaming," all the time?

611
00:28:36,558 --> 00:28:38,490
Just because you mentioned a condition,

612
00:28:38,492 --> 00:28:40,556
it doesn't mean you're shaming victims!

613
00:28:40,558 --> 00:28:42,356
How come nobody accused me

614
00:28:42,358 --> 00:28:44,790
of "fat-shaming" the first
20 years of my career,

615
00:28:44,792 --> 00:28:48,956
when all I did was attack
my awful torso onstage?

616
00:28:48,958 --> 00:28:52,756
I made a living for two decades
mashing my... because first

617
00:28:52,758 --> 00:28:54,123
of all, I was 30 pounds heavier,

618
00:28:54,125 --> 00:28:56,223
and it was not evenly distributed.

619
00:28:56,225 --> 00:28:59,790
It was, like, between my
pubis and my weak chin!

620
00:28:59,792 --> 00:29:01,756
Like a little bag of placenta!

621
00:29:01,758 --> 00:29:06,690
I would call myself an
"ugly, unfuckable amoeba!"

622
00:29:06,692 --> 00:29:08,590
Patrice O'Neal said, "Jim Norton

623
00:29:08,592 --> 00:29:11,192
looks like any container you pour him in!"

624
00:29:22,792 --> 00:29:24,456
Nobody attacked Patrice, "Hey,

625
00:29:24,458 --> 00:29:27,123
that's not right!" You know?

626
00:29:27,125 --> 00:29:28,856
I used to do a joke in my act, right?

627
00:29:28,858 --> 00:29:31,356
Talked about taking a dildo

628
00:29:31,358 --> 00:29:36,956
and duck-taping it between
my almost-C-cup breasts,

629
00:29:36,958 --> 00:29:40,756
and killing myself with
a gun on New Year's Eve!

630
00:29:40,758 --> 00:29:42,056
Not one person ever said,

631
00:29:42,058 --> 00:29:43,423
"Hey, don't go fat-shaming

632
00:29:43,425 --> 00:29:44,523
yourself, that's..."

633
00:29:44,525 --> 00:29:45,690
No! They were more, like,

634
00:29:45,692 --> 00:29:49,458
Ahhh! "Do it, piggy tits! Ahhh!"

635
00:29:54,758 --> 00:29:56,023
And the way, you know,

636
00:29:56,025 --> 00:29:58,023
it's funny, because I have
dropped the weight, and,

637
00:29:58,025 --> 00:29:59,558
you know, there's still...

638
00:30:04,225 --> 00:30:05,623
Would I be really annoying

639
00:30:05,625 --> 00:30:07,358
if I got cocky after I said
that, and just trying to...

640
00:30:13,892 --> 00:30:15,690
People ask, like, "How
do you drop the weight?"

641
00:30:15,692 --> 00:30:18,123
And it really is just from,
you know, doing the right thing.

642
00:30:18,125 --> 00:30:20,290
Keeping it off is really hard.

643
00:30:20,292 --> 00:30:22,123
And one of the things that
helped me keep the weight

644
00:30:22,125 --> 00:30:24,456
off, honestly, was, you kind
of get used to compliments.

645
00:30:24,458 --> 00:30:26,323
And people are going, "Hey, you
look like you lost some weight,"

646
00:30:26,325 --> 00:30:28,323
and it makes you feel good about yourself.

647
00:30:28,325 --> 00:30:30,623
And some of you understand this story.

648
00:30:30,625 --> 00:30:33,792
I was a... I'm an Ozzy Osbourne
fanatic for my entire life.

649
00:30:37,125 --> 00:30:40,190
And I've met Ozzy many
times, I've interviewed him

650
00:30:40,192 --> 00:30:43,123
over the years, and I never
expect Ozzy to remember me,

651
00:30:43,125 --> 00:30:44,590
because there's this really nasty rumor

652
00:30:44,592 --> 00:30:45,990
that he experimented with drugs

653
00:30:45,992 --> 00:30:47,558
in the '80s...

654
00:30:51,225 --> 00:30:53,590
and the last time I saw him,

655
00:30:53,592 --> 00:30:54,923
not only did he recognize me,

656
00:30:54,925 --> 00:30:57,223
but he realized that I had lost weight.

657
00:30:57,225 --> 00:30:59,556
And it was one of the most
surreal moments of my life.

658
00:30:59,558 --> 00:31:01,056
Ozzy walks in, and he goes,

659
00:31:01,058 --> 00:31:02,556
[ENGLISH ACCENT] "Hey man,
you've lost a lot of weight,

660
00:31:02,558 --> 00:31:04,556
you look great! What have you been doing?"

661
00:31:04,558 --> 00:31:06,956
And I was so blown away

662
00:31:06,958 --> 00:31:09,290
that Ozzy realized I lost weight,

663
00:31:09,292 --> 00:31:13,192
that I responded to him in an Irish accent!

664
00:31:17,792 --> 00:31:20,690
I have no idea why I did
it! It wasn't planned!

665
00:31:20,692 --> 00:31:22,056
He's, like, "You lost weight,
what have you been doing?"

666
00:31:22,058 --> 00:31:23,290
And I was, like,

[IRISH ACCENT] "Ah, just going
to the gym, eating better!"

I swear to you, I didn't...

669
00:31:33,358 --> 00:31:34,990
hey, if Ozzy compliments

670
00:31:34,992 --> 00:31:36,823
you, pretend you're from
somewhere else, you know?

671
00:31:36,825 --> 00:31:39,323
[IRISH ACCENT] "Ah, just
lifting a few weights, man!"

672
00:31:39,325 --> 00:31:41,356
You know.

673
00:31:41,358 --> 00:31:44,123
I didn't even realized I had
done it until an hour later,

674
00:31:44,125 --> 00:31:46,425
when Anthony went,
"What the fuck was that?"

675
00:31:49,492 --> 00:31:51,256
One of the most humiliating moments

676
00:31:51,258 --> 00:31:52,990
of my life, that I did that!

677
00:31:52,992 --> 00:31:55,225
And Bob Kelly, that piece of shit!

678
00:32:01,358 --> 00:32:03,523

he was playing it for

00:32:17,358 --> 00:32:19,625
duh... like, he's from fucking Ireland!"

688
00:32:28,858 --> 00:32:31,023
There's also a lot of concerns,
it seems, I don't know,

689
00:32:31,025 --> 00:32:33,390
are you guys concerned about
your privacy going away?

690
00:32:33,392 --> 00:32:36,290
It really does seem like that's
been a big topic of conversation

691
00:32:36,292 --> 00:32:39,223
for the last few years; is that
our privacy is being taken away.

692
00:32:39,225 --> 00:32:42,523
No, it's not. It's being given away, by us.

693
00:32:42,525 --> 00:32:44,523
And it's not big brother,
it's not the government,

694
00:32:44,525 --> 00:32:46,323
we're snitching on each other!

695
00:32:46,325 --> 00:32:48,090
We are tattling on each other!

696
00:32:48,092 --> 00:32:50,256
We're the one taking each
other's private information

697
00:32:50,258 --> 00:32:52,823
and uploading it, and
giving it to the newspapers.

698
00:32:52,825 --> 00:32:55,690
That's us! Donald Sterling was a great test

699
00:32:55,692 --> 00:32:57,956
of how much do we value
privacy in this country,

700
00:32:57,958 --> 00:33:00,490
and we failed miserably!

701
00:33:00,492 --> 00:33:03,756
We failed miserably, because
he's not a likable guy.

702
00:33:03,758 --> 00:33:05,890
And you can't judge
privacy by whether or not

703
00:33:05,892 --> 00:33:07,356
somebody is likable.

704
00:33:07,358 --> 00:33:09,890
I wish they would have
caught him committing a crime!

705
00:33:09,892 --> 00:33:12,823
He didn't deserve to lose
a billion dollar franchise

706
00:33:12,825 --> 00:33:15,290
because he said nasty shit in his house!

707
00:33:15,292 --> 00:33:16,556
Like, wouldn't it have been
better if they caught him

708
00:33:16,558 --> 00:33:17,990
in a pedophile sting?

709
00:33:17,992 --> 00:33:19,823
Wouldn't that have felt just something,

710
00:33:19,825 --> 00:33:20,890
like, "Ahh, bring in those kids,

711
00:33:20,892 --> 00:33:22,725
I'm going to fuck them all!

712
00:33:25,692 --> 00:33:27,790
But only the white ones,
I don't fuck black ones!

713
00:33:27,792 --> 00:33:29,692
I only fuck the white ones!

714
00:33:33,192 --> 00:33:35,690
Then people could sit
around and go, "Ugghh!

715
00:33:35,692 --> 00:33:39,192
He's a racist!"

716
00:33:43,358 --> 00:33:45,590
You know. And again, he's not a nice guy,

717
00:33:45,592 --> 00:33:48,990
and his girlfriend was
kind of a twat to tape him,

718
00:33:48,992 --> 00:33:50,990
but I didn't like his
little schoolboy answer.

719
00:33:50,992 --> 00:33:52,690
He's not an empathetic character.

720
00:33:52,692 --> 00:33:55,192
"Oh, I thought that girl liked me!"

721
00:33:56,592 --> 00:33:59,690
You're 80, she's 35!

722
00:33:59,692 --> 00:34:02,490
If she's fucking you, it's for your money!

723
00:34:02,492 --> 00:34:03,856
And I'm not knocking that arrangement.

724
00:34:03,858 --> 00:34:06,190
That encourages me to work hard,

725
00:34:06,192 --> 00:34:09,856
and save my money and be
somebody, so when I'm 80,

726
00:34:09,858 --> 00:34:11,856
I can fuck a
35-year-old!

727
00:34:11,858 --> 00:34:13,390
But I'm not going to be delusional about it

728
00:34:13,392 --> 00:34:14,690
and think she's into it.
Like, what do you think?

729
00:34:14,692 --> 00:34:16,156
That's her fetish? She wants

730
00:34:16,158 --> 00:34:19,092
your rotten, silly-putty
dick jammed into her?

731
00:34:20,192 --> 00:34:22,992
"Yeah, I'm going to give it to you slow!"

732
00:34:26,692 --> 00:34:27,956
Then his dementia kicks in,

733
00:34:27,958 --> 00:34:29,458
he just stops!

734
00:34:32,558 --> 00:34:36,990
She's got to yell at him,
"Donald!" "Ahh, who are you?

735
00:34:36,992 --> 00:34:38,756
You've got an Adam's apple and a visor!

736
00:34:38,758 --> 00:34:41,023
Aargh!"

737
00:34:41,025 --> 00:34:42,958
Pisses on her leg, "Aargh!"

738
00:34:47,958 --> 00:34:49,756
But he's a hard guy to empathize with,

739
00:34:49,758 --> 00:34:51,456
because he is a racist, you know?

740
00:34:51,458 --> 00:34:54,756
He's not a hateful neo-Nazi
type of racist, like,

741
00:34:54,758 --> 00:34:56,456
he doesn't want to beat the
shit out of black people,

742
00:34:56,458 --> 00:34:58,123
he is one of those really old guys

743
00:34:58,125 --> 00:34:59,690
who doesn't even know he's a racist.

744
00:34:59,692 --> 00:35:01,990
Like, he's the type of guy
who would meet President Obama

745
00:35:01,992 --> 00:35:05,725
and go, "Boy, you people
sure have come a long way!

746
00:35:09,892 --> 00:35:12,458
You're as good as I am!"

747
00:35:15,325 --> 00:35:17,323
And he was mad that his girlfriend

748
00:35:17,325 --> 00:35:19,490
was hanging out with all
these world-class athletes

749
00:35:19,492 --> 00:35:21,690
and posting the pictures on social media,

750
00:35:21,692 --> 00:35:23,856
probably because his
friends were giving him shit.

751
00:35:23,858 --> 00:35:26,156
And now, on the tape is
that one funny moment,

752
00:35:26,158 --> 00:35:28,756
where she, like, has a
picture with Magic Johnson.

753
00:35:28,758 --> 00:35:30,890
And he yells at her for it.

754
00:35:30,892 --> 00:35:32,990
And she's, like, "Well, I
happen to admire Magic Johnson!"

755
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:34,223
And he's, like, "Well, you can admire him,

756
00:35:34,225 --> 00:35:35,556
but do it privately!

757
00:35:35,558 --> 00:35:36,890
You could bring him over here,

758
00:35:36,892 --> 00:35:38,956
you could feed him and fuck him,

759
00:35:38,958 --> 00:35:41,492
just don't post it on Instagram!"

760
00:35:43,225 --> 00:35:46,192
You're encouraging her
to fuck Magic Johnson?

761
00:35:50,758 --> 00:35:54,392
Donald, perhaps you haven't heard...

762
00:36:00,958 --> 00:36:02,290
That's the last guy

763
00:36:02,292 --> 00:36:04,523
you should be encouraging her to fuck!

764
00:36:04,525 --> 00:36:06,190
Let her fuck Kobe Bryant,

765
00:36:06,192 --> 00:36:08,390
or LeBron James, like, and
then put on an oven mitt

766
00:36:08,392 --> 00:36:10,692
and jerk Magic off into the sink!

767
00:36:18,358 --> 00:36:19,956
Guy's a billionaire,

768
00:36:19,958 --> 00:36:23,192
he has a 1980 Forrest
Gump understanding of AIDS!

769
00:36:24,692 --> 00:36:27,725
"Why you coughing so much, Jenny?"

770
00:36:34,058 --> 00:36:38,456
You look really thin!

771
00:36:38,458 --> 00:36:40,890
Boy, him and Lieutenant Dan did
really great with the ladies.

772
00:36:40,892 --> 00:36:44,525
"Forrest, this is my fat
Asian wife, Susan, Forrest!

773
00:36:48,492 --> 00:36:50,456
We did really great with the chicks!

774
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:52,490
Your wife weighs 40 pounds,

775
00:36:52,492 --> 00:36:55,725
and my wife looks like the
guy who sang "Gingham Style"!

776
00:37:03,492 --> 00:37:06,756
Who knows, maybe Sterling did
have dementia, I don't know.

777
00:37:06,758 --> 00:37:08,456
Maybe that... they said
that's why they took the team,

778
00:37:08,458 --> 00:37:10,823
because his faculties weren't all there.

779
00:37:10,825 --> 00:37:12,990
He didn't look good in the
Anderson Cooper interview.

780
00:37:12,992 --> 00:37:14,523
I don't know if you guys
remember that interview,

781
00:37:14,525 --> 00:37:16,456
but whenever you get in trouble,
the first thing the lawyers

782
00:37:16,458 --> 00:37:18,523
tell you is shut the fuck
up, don't talk to anybody.

783
00:37:18,525 --> 00:37:19,790
And I'm always, like, no, go out there

784
00:37:19,792 --> 00:37:21,156
and speak up for yourself!

785
00:37:21,158 --> 00:37:23,223
But then I saw him in that
Anderson Cooper interview,

786
00:37:23,225 --> 00:37:24,690
and I'm, like, "Oh,
that's why they tell you

787
00:37:24,692 --> 00:37:28,056
to shut the fuck up!" Not good!

788
00:37:28,058 --> 00:37:30,690
Jerry Sandusky did a
better job of damage control

789
00:37:30,692 --> 00:37:33,456
in the Bob Costas interview.

790
00:37:33,458 --> 00:37:36,223
And that was not a good job
of damage control, at all!

791
00:37:36,225 --> 00:37:37,790
"Why did you shower with them?

792
00:37:37,792 --> 00:37:40,725
"I just like when their
hineys smell like shampoo, Bob!

793
00:37:42,958 --> 00:37:44,590
I like when we would wrestle around

794
00:37:44,592 --> 00:37:47,725
and our scrotums got tangled
up like old phone cords!

795
00:37:51,892 --> 00:37:53,290
There was nothing wrong with those boys

796
00:37:53,292 --> 00:37:55,290
sleeping over and screaming into a pillow

797
00:37:55,292 --> 00:37:57,823
for an hour and a half,

798
00:37:57,825 --> 00:38:00,356
while my codependent,
Brian-Dennehy-looking wife

799
00:38:00,358 --> 00:38:02,323
just stayed upstairs making
cookies and whistling,

800
00:38:02,325 --> 00:38:05,190
so she couldn't hear the screams!"

801
00:38:05,192 --> 00:38:07,556
Another fucking delusional
spouse, "Who wants a cookie?"

802
00:38:07,558 --> 00:38:10,690
"Aha, ha, ha!"

803
00:38:10,692 --> 00:38:14,056
Ooh, someone needs a sugar
cookie to dab those tears

804
00:38:14,058 --> 00:38:16,458
and bleeding assholes, doesn't he?"

805
00:38:25,158 --> 00:38:26,523
So, look, maybe, you know,

806
00:38:26,525 --> 00:38:28,690
maybe his mental health
wasn't good, because Sterling,

807
00:38:28,692 --> 00:38:31,756
it seemed like that Anderson
Cooper interview was going okay,

808
00:38:31,758 --> 00:38:33,156
and then it just went off

809
00:38:33,158 --> 00:38:35,556
the rails very suddenly,
it was really bizarre.

810
00:38:35,558 --> 00:38:37,390
They were talking, and out of nowhere,

811
00:38:37,392 --> 00:38:41,092
Sterling goes, "And when has
Magic Johnson done it so great?"

812
00:38:42,358 --> 00:38:44,056
And you could see Anderson Cooper

813
00:38:44,058 --> 00:38:45,323
was actually thrown by this.

814
00:38:45,325 --> 00:38:46,356
He's, like, "Well, you
know, he's an entrepreneur,

815
00:38:46,358 --> 00:38:47,956
he's started a lot of businesses."

816
00:38:47,958 --> 00:38:50,858
And then Sterling just
blurts out, "He's got AIDS!"

817
00:38:56,325 --> 00:38:57,690
That's the greatest example

818
00:38:57,692 --> 00:38:59,190
of an old man blurting shit

819
00:38:59,192 --> 00:39:01,856
out you're ever going to see in your life!

820
00:39:01,858 --> 00:39:03,523
That's the type of thing
you'd expect an old guy

821
00:39:03,525 --> 00:39:04,756
to say when he's walking, like,

822
00:39:04,758 --> 00:39:06,756
with his ass hanging
out of a hospital gown.

823
00:39:06,758 --> 00:39:08,456
"Yeah, he's got AIDS!

824
00:39:08,458 --> 00:39:12,525
He's putting AIDS in my
Jello and in my orange juice!"

825
00:39:19,292 --> 00:39:20,223
And it's not even,

826
00:39:20,225 --> 00:39:21,890
you know, again, going into people's pasts,

827
00:39:21,892 --> 00:39:23,423
or privacy invasions.

828
00:39:23,425 --> 00:39:25,423
You can also get in trouble in this culture

829
00:39:25,425 --> 00:39:28,390
that we're in right now
for giving an opinion

830
00:39:28,392 --> 00:39:31,356
that one segment of the
population finds unpleasant.

831
00:39:31,358 --> 00:39:34,056
Like, we claim that we like
honesty and open dialog,

832
00:39:34,058 --> 00:39:35,523
and then all we do is go after people

833
00:39:35,525 --> 00:39:36,923
for saying shit we don't like!

834
00:39:36,925 --> 00:39:40,423
Phil Robertson, the
patriarch of Duck Dynasty,

835
00:39:40,425 --> 00:39:43,790
in an interview with GQ said
he was against gay marriage.

836
00:39:43,792 --> 00:39:46,290
And I don't like that
opinion, I think it's stupid,

837
00:39:46,292 --> 00:39:47,956
and I'm all for gay marriage.

838
00:39:47,958 --> 00:39:51,156
But you shouldn't be afraid
to say you're against it.

839
00:39:51,158 --> 00:39:52,456
You know? Because A&E was so full of shit,

840
00:39:52,458 --> 00:39:53,956
they pulled him off the air.

841
00:39:53,958 --> 00:39:56,390
They're like, "We had no
idea he felt that way!"

842
00:39:56,392 --> 00:39:57,892
I know, why would you?

843
00:39:59,358 --> 00:40:01,456
He's only a born again Christian preacher!

844
00:40:01,458 --> 00:40:04,656
What are the odds he's
against gay marriage?

845
00:40:04,658 --> 00:40:05,856
A hundred percent!

846
00:40:05,858 --> 00:40:08,323
Those are the odds!

847
00:40:08,325 --> 00:40:10,490
The entire family looks like the Unabomber,

848
00:40:10,492 --> 00:40:13,156
how do you think they
feel about gay people?

849
00:40:13,158 --> 00:40:14,223
Here's the rule of thumb:

850
00:40:14,225 --> 00:40:15,890
When you say, "homosexuals,"

851
00:40:15,892 --> 00:40:17,325
you're against gay marriage!

852
00:40:22,858 --> 00:40:24,356
And he said something like, "You know,

853
00:40:24,358 --> 00:40:26,190
I'm against homosexuality,
bestiality, fornacation."

854
00:40:26,192 --> 00:40:30,223
And I understand why gay people were upset.

855
00:40:30,225 --> 00:40:31,856
I mean, I really do. I mean,

856
00:40:31,858 --> 00:40:33,723
no one wants to be mentioned
right before "bestiality."

857
00:40:33,725 --> 00:40:35,623
I get it!

858
00:40:35,625 --> 00:40:37,623
I don't think gay people are
being unreasonable to go, "Look,

859
00:40:37,625 --> 00:40:39,156
you don't have to love us,
but could you separate us

860
00:40:39,158 --> 00:40:41,156
from the dog fuckers by more than a comma,

861
00:40:41,158 --> 00:40:42,725
you piece of shit?"

862
00:40:44,592 --> 00:40:46,423
But he gets pulled off the air,

863
00:40:46,425 --> 00:40:48,390
and people were celebrating,
and groups were happy.

864
00:40:48,392 --> 00:40:51,156
And that's a very dangerous
place to be in a free society.

865
00:40:51,158 --> 00:40:52,490
The only group that should have been happy

866
00:40:52,492 --> 00:40:53,956
he got in trouble are ducks!

867
00:40:53,958 --> 00:40:56,656
I understand if ducks hate Phil Robertson,

868
00:40:56,658 --> 00:40:57,890
because that duck whistle

869
00:40:57,892 --> 00:41:00,190
is responsible for a duck holocaust.

870
00:41:00,192 --> 00:41:02,856
So, I get it if they're not a fan of his!

871
00:41:02,858 --> 00:41:04,756
And first of all, like, I don't hunt ducks,

872
00:41:04,758 --> 00:41:06,023
so I don't know anything about it.

873
00:41:06,025 --> 00:41:08,692
But I will say, if you
have to trick a duck,

874
00:41:10,392 --> 00:41:11,390
you're a shitty hunter!

875
00:41:11,392 --> 00:41:13,490
I'm sorry!

876
00:41:13,492 --> 00:41:15,156
Because ducks aren't dangerous animals.

877
00:41:15,158 --> 00:41:16,690
You know, like a bear or an alligator,

878
00:41:16,692 --> 00:41:17,856
where it's kill or be killed.

879
00:41:17,858 --> 00:41:20,123
This is kill, or wait a few more minutes!

880
00:41:20,125 --> 00:41:21,758
That's all it is!

881
00:41:24,192 --> 00:41:25,190
You know, ducks are very, very...

882
00:41:25,192 --> 00:41:26,756
they're very non-threatening.

883
00:41:26,758 --> 00:41:28,756
They have little, fat delicious stomachs,

884
00:41:28,758 --> 00:41:30,190
their legs are this long,

885
00:41:30,192 --> 00:41:32,292
they kick their own assholes when they run!

886
00:41:34,225 --> 00:41:35,556
They're not hard to find.

887
00:41:35,558 --> 00:41:37,023
You'd think if you were that helpless,

888
00:41:37,025 --> 00:41:39,356
you'd kind of keep it on the
D-L when you're in the forest.

889
00:41:39,358 --> 00:41:41,390
But these idiots walk through
like they're the fucking mayor!

890
00:41:41,392 --> 00:41:43,290
"Raahh! Raahh!

891
00:41:43,292 --> 00:41:44,825
Raahh!"

892
00:41:46,758 --> 00:41:48,423
You don't need to "trick a duck."

893
00:41:48,425 --> 00:41:49,823
You know what you need to hunt a duck?

894
00:41:49,825 --> 00:41:50,956
Two ears and a hammer.

895
00:41:50,958 --> 00:41:52,892
That's all you need to hunt a duck!

896
00:41:54,258 --> 00:41:57,823
Or, a piece of Wonder Bread,
you impatient mother fucker!

897
00:41:57,825 --> 00:42:00,325
Just stand at the end
of the lake and wave it!

898
00:42:01,858 --> 00:42:03,556
They don't speak English,
you could even tell them

899
00:42:03,558 --> 00:42:05,156
what you're going to do!
"Come here, little duck!

900
00:42:05,158 --> 00:42:07,390
I'm going to bash your brains in!

901
00:42:07,392 --> 00:42:08,490
Gonna bash them right

902
00:42:08,492 --> 00:42:10,325
the fuck in!"

903
00:42:12,758 --> 00:42:13,856
Ducks are so stupid;

904
00:42:13,858 --> 00:42:15,323
while one duck is eating the bread,

905
00:42:15,325 --> 00:42:17,190
you could pick the
other duck up by the legs

906
00:42:17,192 --> 00:42:20,990
and Caligula-smash his head into a rock!

907
00:42:20,992 --> 00:42:23,890
The other ducks wouldn't even flee!

908
00:42:23,892 --> 00:42:25,823
They'd all go, "Oh, look,
he's drying Murray off,

909
00:42:25,825 --> 00:42:27,192
how helpful!"

910
00:42:29,558 --> 00:42:31,956
You know how stupid ducks

911
00:42:31,958 --> 00:42:34,290
must feel when they
fall for that duck call?

912
00:42:34,292 --> 00:42:35,290
How humiliating!

913
00:42:35,292 --> 00:42:36,256
They're, like, [DUCK CALL],

914
00:42:36,258 --> 00:42:37,456
they're, like, "Come on, guys,

915
00:42:37,458 --> 00:42:38,523
someone needs help!" You're, like,

916
00:42:38,525 --> 00:42:40,690
pop pop pop, pop pop pop
pop pop! "No, it's okay,

917
00:42:40,692 --> 00:42:42,325
I think it's just firecrackers!"

918
00:42:56,092 --> 00:42:57,956
It's just a very scary time

919
00:42:57,958 --> 00:42:59,456
for privacy, and for stuff like that.

920
00:42:59,458 --> 00:43:01,056
And I think part of the reason

921
00:43:01,058 --> 00:43:04,390
we are so ill-equipped
to handle everything

922
00:43:04,392 --> 00:43:07,890
is because we didn't understand
the technology that was coming.

923
00:43:07,892 --> 00:43:09,223
People are getting in trouble,

924
00:43:09,225 --> 00:43:11,756
because we're responding
immediately to things.

925
00:43:11,758 --> 00:43:15,123
And here's why: Because
nobody warned us about this.

926
00:43:15,125 --> 00:43:17,756
Nobody told us when we were in high school.

927
00:43:17,758 --> 00:43:19,690
Did anybody come to you,
we talked about the future?

928
00:43:19,692 --> 00:43:21,223
They said things like, "Oh,

929
00:43:21,225 --> 00:43:23,556
you're going to have flying cars," or,

930
00:43:23,558 --> 00:43:25,790
you know, "Mom's going to
push a button and a pot roast

931
00:43:25,792 --> 00:43:27,223
will show up in the living room!

932
00:43:27,225 --> 00:43:30,492
Ooh! Good for mom!"

933
00:43:31,792 --> 00:43:33,456
No guidance counselor ever just

934
00:43:33,458 --> 00:43:35,690
said, "Jim, stay alive,

935
00:43:35,692 --> 00:43:36,890
because someday soon,

936
00:43:36,892 --> 00:43:39,456
you're going to have a
six-inch glass telephone

937
00:43:39,458 --> 00:43:42,525
that you can use to photograph your dick!

938
00:43:46,758 --> 00:43:49,092
And you can send it to
any girl in the world!"

939
00:43:50,425 --> 00:43:53,092
I wouldn't even ask if it made phone calls!

940
00:43:59,958 --> 00:44:02,523
We're losing the ability to pause.

941
00:44:02,525 --> 00:44:04,490
Now, I have a lot of
dick photos on my phone.

942
00:44:04,492 --> 00:44:06,356
And that's easy for me
to say as a comedian.

943
00:44:06,358 --> 00:44:09,056
I know as regular people,
I have a little more leeway

944
00:44:09,058 --> 00:44:10,456
than you do; you know,
you're a schoolteacher,

945
00:44:10,458 --> 00:44:11,490
you can't go on Facebook,

946
00:44:11,492 --> 00:44:12,290
"Took a great cock shot!

947
00:44:12,292 --> 00:44:14,058
L-O-L!"

948
00:44:16,692 --> 00:44:18,156
I had so many pictures

949
00:44:18,158 --> 00:44:19,356
of my dick on my phone,

950
00:44:19,358 --> 00:44:22,756
I can't hand my phone to a family member.

951
00:44:22,758 --> 00:44:25,056
Like, if I was having a stroke,
and my mother was, like, "Quick!

952
00:44:25,058 --> 00:44:28,358
I'll call the hospital!" I
would have to go, "Fuck it!

953
00:44:32,525 --> 00:44:34,525
I'll be all right, ma!"

954
00:44:42,458 --> 00:44:43,956
But, you know,

955
00:44:43,958 --> 00:44:45,956
it's so easy to ruin somebody's life.

956
00:44:45,958 --> 00:44:47,923
And once again, we're
not punishing the people

957
00:44:47,925 --> 00:44:49,456
who are releasing the information,

958
00:44:49,458 --> 00:44:51,423
who are doing the life-ruining.

959
00:44:51,425 --> 00:44:54,390
We're actually penalizing the
people whose stuff is stolen,

960
00:44:54,392 --> 00:44:57,456
and whose text messages
and shit are posted online!

961
00:44:57,458 --> 00:45:00,356
Like, Anthony Weiner in
New York is a great example.

962
00:45:00,358 --> 00:45:02,023
I don't know much about his politics,

963
00:45:02,025 --> 00:45:04,556
I just know that people who voted for him

964
00:45:04,558 --> 00:45:07,456
felt that he really did
what they wanted him to do,

965
00:45:07,458 --> 00:45:11,990
and his career is ruined
because of stupid dick pictures!

966
00:45:11,992 --> 00:45:14,556
And people were, like, "He
used very poor judgment!"

967
00:45:14,558 --> 00:45:17,523
I thought he used wonderful judgment!

968
00:45:17,525 --> 00:45:19,156
He wasn't cheating on his wife at all,

969
00:45:19,158 --> 00:45:20,456
he was just talking to her!

970
00:45:20,458 --> 00:45:23,156
He didn't risk disease,
he didn't risk pregnancy.

971
00:45:23,158 --> 00:45:25,092
He didn't waste gas!

972
00:45:27,892 --> 00:45:29,156
That, to me, is an excellent... by the way,

973
00:45:29,158 --> 00:45:31,456
and it shows you how
full of shit people are!

974
00:45:31,458 --> 00:45:33,123
Because how many years have
we been saying, "Why can't we

975
00:45:33,125 --> 00:45:34,990
get a regular guy elected to office?"

976
00:45:34,992 --> 00:45:36,156
That was the best shot

977
00:45:36,158 --> 00:45:37,725
we're ever going to have!

978
00:45:39,058 --> 00:45:41,556
Because what says "regular
guy" more than a man

979
00:45:41,558 --> 00:45:44,790
who gets in trouble
sending a photo of his dick,

980
00:45:44,792 --> 00:45:46,592
and then does it again?

981
00:45:48,758 --> 00:45:50,823
He did it again!

982
00:45:50,825 --> 00:45:52,423
When he did it the second time,

983
00:45:52,425 --> 00:45:53,923
every guy in this country
should have said, "I'm going

984
00:45:53,925 --> 00:45:56,823
to follow this guy to the White House,

985
00:45:56,825 --> 00:46:01,790
because he understands who I am!"

986
00:46:01,792 --> 00:46:03,223
And the pictures were not good.

987
00:46:03,225 --> 00:46:04,823
I mean, we all saw the picture.

988
00:46:04,825 --> 00:46:06,756
I mean, it was something
that he really... that had...

989
00:46:06,758 --> 00:46:07,890
he had a towel around it,

990
00:46:07,892 --> 00:46:09,556
he had a hard-on tenting,

991
00:46:09,558 --> 00:46:11,156
and his body, and his face.

992
00:46:11,158 --> 00:46:12,356
And when I saw that he had put

993
00:46:12,358 --> 00:46:14,856
his face and his heart
on in the same picture,

994
00:46:14,858 --> 00:46:16,156
I wanted to hug him!

995
00:46:16,158 --> 00:46:19,525
Like, come here, you rookie, get over here!

996
00:46:23,858 --> 00:46:25,990
What is the matter with you? Never!

997
00:46:25,992 --> 00:46:28,523
I'll send my face, I'll send my dick.

998
00:46:28,525 --> 00:46:31,356
Never in the same photo!

999
00:46:31,358 --> 00:46:34,190
I won't even take those
pictures in the same room,

1000
00:46:34,192 --> 00:46:37,192
so you can put them
together later in Photoshop!

1001
00:46:38,292 --> 00:46:39,990
Like, if you want a picture of my face,

1002
00:46:39,992 --> 00:46:42,223
I'll go outside and
stand in front of a tree,

1003
00:46:42,225 --> 00:46:43,856
or have some sunshine.

1004
00:46:43,858 --> 00:46:44,690
And then, if you want my dick, I'll,

1005
00:46:44,692 --> 00:46:47,590
like, open the refrigerator,

1006
00:46:47,592 --> 00:46:51,823
hang it in front of the
vegetable drawer, you know.

1007
00:46:51,825 --> 00:46:54,256
I'll move, obviously, the
zucchinis and cucumbers,

1008
00:46:54,258 --> 00:46:58,192
and put in some baby carrots!

1009
00:47:04,292 --> 00:47:06,756
But it's easy to get in trouble,

1010
00:47:06,758 --> 00:47:08,190
because the immediacy...

1011
00:47:08,192 --> 00:47:09,690
like, you know, we're all, you know, horny.

1012
00:47:09,692 --> 00:47:11,790
You're talking to somebody,
there's no pause anymore!

1013
00:47:11,792 --> 00:47:13,190
You're talking to a girl,
you're texting, she's,

1014
00:47:13,192 --> 00:47:14,356
like, "I want to see your dick!" You're,

1015
00:47:14,358 --> 00:47:15,490
like, "You want to see my fucking dick?

1016
00:47:15,492 --> 00:47:17,690
There's my fucking dick!

1017
00:47:17,692 --> 00:47:20,356
Oh my God, I ruined my life!

1018
00:47:20,358 --> 00:47:22,556
Oh, my God! And now,
there's pre-cum in my hair!

1019
00:47:22,558 --> 00:47:28,223
Oh, my God!" I don't
think we're any worse now

1020
00:47:28,225 --> 00:47:29,990
than we used to be, we just...

1021
00:47:29,992 --> 00:47:31,490
years ago, you couldn't do that,

1022
00:47:31,492 --> 00:47:33,523
because the technology
didn't exist to do it.

1023
00:47:33,525 --> 00:47:35,790
Men were the same 30 years ago.

1024
00:47:35,792 --> 00:47:37,323
You know, in the mid
-'80s, you'd be talking to a girl,

1025
00:47:37,325 --> 00:47:38,456
like, "You want to see my dick?

1026
00:47:38,458 --> 00:47:40,190
I'll show you my fucking dick!

1027
00:47:40,192 --> 00:47:42,492
Sit tight!"

1028
00:47:44,425 --> 00:47:51,290
You'd have to go get the Polaroid
out, try to line up the shot,

1029
00:47:51,292 --> 00:47:53,823
and your dick would never
get hard for the photo.

1030
00:47:53,825 --> 00:47:54,923
Remember the old fluff?

1031
00:47:54,925 --> 00:47:56,123
You'd have to do the fluff,

1032
00:47:56,125 --> 00:47:58,890
and then try to move
your hand out of the way,

1033
00:47:58,892 --> 00:48:00,956
to snap the picture on the upswing.

1034
00:48:00,958 --> 00:48:02,658
You never got it, it
was always, like, that...

1035
00:48:04,492 --> 00:48:06,156
And then finally, you'd just kind of pinch

1036
00:48:06,158 --> 00:48:08,756
the back of the head and hold it out.

1037
00:48:08,758 --> 00:48:10,958
You looked like a lioness holding her cub!

1038
00:48:20,825 --> 00:48:22,790
Oh!

1039
00:48:22,792 --> 00:48:25,156
Then, you'd have to get in
the car, drive it to her house,

1040
00:48:25,158 --> 00:48:26,890
beep the horn, roll down the window,

1041
00:48:26,892 --> 00:48:28,456
"Here's my blurry, thin dick,

1042
00:48:28,458 --> 00:48:30,292
stupid," drive away...

1043
00:48:33,125 --> 00:48:35,823
You couldn't claim
temporary insanity in 1984.

1044
00:48:35,825 --> 00:48:37,456
"I didn't know what I was doing,"

1045
00:48:37,458 --> 00:48:39,156
you paid three tolls before
you gave her your dick picture,

1046
00:48:39,158 --> 00:48:40,692
what are you talking about?

1047
00:48:44,525 --> 00:48:47,190
And you couldn't ruin
somebody's life instantly.

1048
00:48:47,192 --> 00:48:49,523
You couldn't have one moment
of vindictiveness back then,

1049
00:48:49,525 --> 00:48:50,523
and ruin someone's life.

1050
00:48:50,525 --> 00:48:52,556
Now, you just push a button,

1051
00:48:52,558 --> 00:48:55,823
and somebody's judgment error is
uploaded into the consciousness

1052
00:48:55,825 --> 00:48:57,323
of the entire planet!

1053
00:48:57,325 --> 00:48:59,856
Thirty years ago, you wanted to
wreck a life with a dick photo?

1054
00:48:59,858 --> 00:49:01,123
Door to door operation!

1055
00:49:01,125 --> 00:49:02,690
[KNOCK]

1056
00:49:02,692 --> 00:49:06,390
Guess who? "I don't know,

1057
00:49:06,392 --> 00:49:09,058
it's kind of small, and he's
wearing a Black Sabbath shirt.

1058
00:49:10,225 --> 00:49:11,423
It's either Jim Norton

1059
00:49:11,425 --> 00:49:13,592
or a five-year-old
with great music taste!"

1060
00:49:19,392 --> 00:49:20,456
And don't get me wrong.

1061
00:49:20,458 --> 00:49:22,423
You know, I'm not blaming technology

1062
00:49:22,425 --> 00:49:24,090
for what we've turned into.

1063
00:49:24,092 --> 00:49:27,792
I'm just saying the immediacy
makes our decision-making,

1064
00:49:28,858 --> 00:49:32,090
you know, a little more important.

1065
00:49:32,092 --> 00:49:33,890
And I was a pervert
long before a computer...

1066
00:49:33,892 --> 00:49:36,123
this is how long I've been a pervert.

1067
00:49:36,125 --> 00:49:39,792
I used to rent pornography
from Rite Aid Pharmacy!

1068
00:49:41,558 --> 00:49:43,090
Does anybody remember 30 years ago,

1069
00:49:43,092 --> 00:49:45,490
when Rite Aid had a video rental section,

1070
00:49:45,492 --> 00:49:46,990
and we didn't own a VCR.

1071
00:49:46,992 --> 00:49:49,556
I would walk a mile to the video store.

1072
00:49:49,558 --> 00:49:52,156
And you were allowed to
rent three porno tapes,

1073
00:49:52,158 --> 00:49:54,156
which was the maximum,
which I think was my fault,

1074
00:49:54,158 --> 00:49:56,392
because the first time I
walked in pushing a hand truck!

1075
00:49:57,858 --> 00:49:59,823
And I think they were, like,
"Somebody better flag this kid,

1076
00:49:59,825 --> 00:50:02,325
or he's going to need Tommy
John surgery before he's 18!"

1077
00:50:05,392 --> 00:50:06,690
And they didn't have the pornos

1078
00:50:06,692 --> 00:50:08,123
displayed all over the pharmacy.

1079
00:50:08,125 --> 00:50:09,723
They had, like, regular movies.

1080
00:50:09,725 --> 00:50:11,190
And if you wanted to see the pornos,

1081
00:50:11,192 --> 00:50:14,290
there was a binder behind the counter

1082
00:50:14,292 --> 00:50:17,056
that had photos of all
the box covers in it.

1083
00:50:17,058 --> 00:50:20,823
So, you'd have to wait until
the counter cleared out,

1084
00:50:20,825 --> 00:50:22,190
then you'd walk over and go,

1085
00:50:22,192 --> 00:50:25,292
like, "Uh, can I see the binder, please?"

1086
00:50:29,458 --> 00:50:32,158
They put on those gloves
they use to train a falcon!

1087
00:50:47,892 --> 00:50:50,656
And then you'd have to
pick out three movies

1088
00:50:50,658 --> 00:50:52,223
that you were going to watch for two days.

1089
00:50:52,225 --> 00:50:54,090
So, your addiction couldn't
go all over the place,

1090
00:50:54,092 --> 00:50:55,656
you had to make a decision.

1091
00:50:55,658 --> 00:50:57,690
"All, right, maybe I'll get,
like, a little girl-girl,

1092
00:50:57,692 --> 00:50:59,190
and maybe I'll wind up getting

1093
00:50:59,192 --> 00:51:00,956
a little interracial porn, is always good."

1094
00:51:00,958 --> 00:51:02,123
Then you get the one you pretend

1095
00:51:02,125 --> 00:51:04,092
you don't know is transsexuals.

1096
00:51:05,292 --> 00:51:06,456
Just hope it's not the same guy

1097
00:51:06,458 --> 00:51:08,156
behind the counter when you bring it back,

1098
00:51:08,158 --> 00:51:09,790
because then you've got
to make up an excuse.

1099
00:51:09,792 --> 00:51:12,492
"Hey, I thought this was
chicks with detectives!

1100
00:51:18,025 --> 00:51:20,325
That's the third time
you got me with this one!"

1101
00:51:28,458 --> 00:51:30,690
But now, man, you don't
have to make decisions.

1102
00:51:30,692 --> 00:51:32,823
You can just open one
of these porn megasites,

1103
00:51:32,825 --> 00:51:34,390
and look at anything you want.

1104
00:51:34,392 --> 00:51:36,523
And that really exacerbates
your sexual addiction.

1105
00:51:36,525 --> 00:51:37,756
I'm not saying it causes it,

1106
00:51:37,758 --> 00:51:39,290
but it does make it a lot worse.

1107
00:51:39,292 --> 00:51:41,523
I want to know how many things
become fetishes that guys

1108
00:51:41,525 --> 00:51:43,156
click on, just to have a laugh.

1109
00:51:43,158 --> 00:51:44,956
Like, how many guys have
clicked on a video, and,

1110
00:51:44,958 --> 00:51:47,890
like, "This girl is going
to shit in this guy's face!"

1111
00:51:47,892 --> 00:51:51,392
[LAUGHS]

1112
00:52:01,392 --> 00:52:03,825
"Oh, for Pete's sake!"

1113
00:52:09,692 --> 00:52:10,990
And the whole, like, pretending

1114
00:52:10,992 --> 00:52:13,223
you're young thing is just bizarre.

1115
00:52:13,225 --> 00:52:15,390
Like, I don't mind the
Catholic school girl skirt.

1116
00:52:15,392 --> 00:52:16,956
That's kind of sexy.

1117
00:52:16,958 --> 00:52:18,690
But I don't like
when 30-year-old woman

1118
00:52:18,692 --> 00:52:21,625
walks into my bedroom,
"I didn't do my homework!"

1119
00:52:24,492 --> 00:52:25,856
"Do it, retard!

1120
00:52:25,858 --> 00:52:28,658
What do you want me to tell you?"

1121
00:52:36,125 --> 00:52:40,290
"Spank me! I was late for school!"

1122
00:52:40,292 --> 00:52:43,690
Nobody gets spanked for
being late for school anymore!

1123
00:52:43,692 --> 00:52:46,256
What is this, 1953 dirty talk?

1124
00:52:46,258 --> 00:52:49,056
"Ooh, spank me, I served
a negro at the counter

1125
00:52:49,058 --> 00:52:50,825
at Woolworth's today!"

1126
00:52:55,825 --> 00:52:57,256
Update your dirty talk

1127
00:52:57,258 --> 00:52:58,390
to the new millennium!

1128
00:52:58,392 --> 00:52:59,890
"Ooh, you brought in muffins,

1129
00:52:59,892 --> 00:53:01,956
even though some of the
kids have peanut allergies!

1130
00:53:01,958 --> 00:53:03,658
Naughty!

1131
00:53:06,858 --> 00:53:08,323
"You didn't give a Valentine's

1132
00:53:08,325 --> 00:53:10,523
Day card to the Muslim boy,
you're not all-inclusive,

1133
00:53:10,525 --> 00:53:12,325
young lady!

1134
00:53:20,858 --> 00:53:22,356
Oh! I've just... you know,

1135
00:53:22,358 --> 00:53:24,156
I think part of the problem
for me is I've been so open

1136
00:53:24,158 --> 00:53:26,690
about how dirty I am for so long,

1137
00:53:26,692 --> 00:53:29,490
it just makes women not
want to go out with me.

1138
00:53:29,492 --> 00:53:34,323
Like, ah, any guy ever been
fucked with a strappon? Cool!

1139
00:53:34,325 --> 00:53:36,525
No no, I'll bite the bullet
on this one, it's fine!

1140
00:53:38,858 --> 00:53:40,190
I've tried.

1141
00:53:40,192 --> 00:53:42,490
I've never actually been
able to go through with it.

1142
00:53:42,492 --> 00:53:44,756
Because it's only because
physically, my body won't take...

1143
00:53:44,758 --> 00:53:46,556
a lot of guys are, like, "What,
what, are you fucked by a guy?"

1144
00:53:46,558 --> 00:53:48,458
No, at this point...

1145
00:53:52,225 --> 00:53:53,756
But there's just

1146
00:53:53,758 --> 00:53:56,323
something perverse about
a woman with a fake dick,

1147
00:53:56,325 --> 00:53:57,890
and she's going to wreck your asshole!

1148
00:53:57,892 --> 00:53:59,456
There's just something that I kind of,

1149
00:53:59,458 --> 00:54:00,992
like, I don't know!

1150
00:54:04,792 --> 00:54:06,190
But I've never been able
to go through with it,

1151
00:54:06,192 --> 00:54:07,390
because for some reason,

1152
00:54:07,392 --> 00:54:09,356
you know, whenever a
strappon is hitting my...

1153
00:54:09,358 --> 00:54:12,192
my asshole reacts like an eye
with a finger in it, just...

1154
00:54:26,858 --> 00:54:28,823
And I've tried a few times,

1155
00:54:28,825 --> 00:54:30,323
I just... I'm finally going
to have to give up on it.

1156
00:54:30,325 --> 00:54:33,156
The last time I tried, I was
in Los Angeles with a woman,

1157
00:54:33,158 --> 00:54:34,390
and I was laying on my back,

1158
00:54:34,392 --> 00:54:35,990
and she's kneeling between my legs.

1159
00:54:35,992 --> 00:54:38,756
And my legs were draped over her thighs.

1160
00:54:38,758 --> 00:54:41,556
And she was jabbing a
sixteenth of an inch in.

1161
00:54:41,558 --> 00:54:43,223
And that was all I needed.

1162
00:54:43,225 --> 00:54:44,523
I was happy with that.

1163
00:54:44,525 --> 00:54:45,756
She's, like, "I'm going to go farther in."

1164
00:54:45,758 --> 00:54:48,956
I'm, like, "No! No!" Like,

1165
00:54:48,958 --> 00:54:50,290
I'm trying not to get
her to piss on the rug!

1166
00:54:50,292 --> 00:54:52,690
"No!"

1167
00:54:52,692 --> 00:54:54,590
Sixteenth of an inch was fine!

1168
00:54:54,592 --> 00:54:55,690
I'm tweedling my nipples,

1169
00:54:55,692 --> 00:54:56,690
"Oh, I'm a bitch!

1170
00:54:56,692 --> 00:54:58,258
I'm a bitch!"

1171
00:55:00,992 --> 00:55:03,356
My poor dick was just curled up,

1172
00:55:03,358 --> 00:55:06,756
limp and shivering like a wet Chihuahua!

1173
00:55:06,758 --> 00:55:08,523
"Oh, what am I doing? Who is he?

1174
00:55:08,525 --> 00:55:09,823
I don't know who he is anymore!

1175
00:55:09,825 --> 00:55:11,392
What is this invader?"

1176
00:55:15,125 --> 00:55:18,390
But then she pushes it
in about a half inch,

1177
00:55:18,392 --> 00:55:19,523
which was a bad move,

1178
00:55:19,525 --> 00:55:21,458
because I had had vegetable juice,

1179
00:55:22,692 --> 00:55:25,790
which tends to make me a little gassy!

1180
00:55:25,792 --> 00:55:27,690
And I told her, like,

1181
00:55:27,692 --> 00:55:29,390
"Do NOT push it...

1182
00:55:29,392 --> 00:55:31,956
no! No!" Because she was going

1183
00:55:31,958 --> 00:55:34,890
to pull it out, "NO!" I'm, like,

1184
00:55:34,892 --> 00:55:36,223
"We have a situation, here!"

1185
00:55:36,225 --> 00:55:38,490
I wanted her to take off that strappon,

1186
00:55:38,492 --> 00:55:39,690
leave it in my asshole,

1187
00:55:39,692 --> 00:55:41,192
and go home!

1188
00:55:48,392 --> 00:55:49,890
But she thought she knew better,

1189
00:55:49,892 --> 00:55:51,725
and she pulled back...

1190
00:55:53,892 --> 00:55:56,556
You know what happens when
the door of an airplane

1191
00:55:56,558 --> 00:55:59,258
gets ripped off at 30,000 feet?

1192
00:56:06,225 --> 00:56:07,756
And she couldn't even get up,

1193
00:56:07,758 --> 00:56:10,290
because my legs were over her thighs, so,

1194
00:56:10,292 --> 00:56:13,092
