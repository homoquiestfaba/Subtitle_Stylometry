1
00:01:08,231 --> 00:01:13,862
You need a man,
a red hot loving Stan.

2
00:01:14,904 --> 00:01:22,203
If you wanna be satisfied,
I'm your guy, forget Kai

3
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:27,792
You need me, 790,
I have the technology

4
00:01:27,917 --> 00:01:29,794
for thee, sweet pea.

5
00:01:29,919 --> 00:01:33,557
- No, me...
- Me

6
00:01:33,815 --> 00:01:35,507
- Me
- Me

7
00:01:35,508 --> 00:01:36,301
Why should she want you?

8
00:01:36,426 --> 00:01:38,136
Because I'm a man, you're a can.

9
00:01:38,219 --> 00:01:39,721
You're a man? That's news.

10
00:01:39,804 --> 00:01:41,723
Well, you're a can - not news!

11
00:01:41,848 --> 00:01:43,933
- At least I can sing.
- So can I.

12
00:01:43,934 --> 00:01:47,145
Since when? You're not
wanted here, leave!

13
00:01:47,146 --> 00:01:47,937
You leave!

14
00:01:47,938 --> 00:01:48,938
You!

15
00:01:48,939 --> 00:01:50,024
You!

16
00:01:51,858 --> 00:01:53,234
I'm leaving.

17
00:01:53,235 --> 00:01:54,361
Where are you going?

18
00:01:54,362 --> 00:01:55,570
Yes, where?

19
00:01:55,653 --> 00:01:57,113
To wake Kai.

20
00:01:57,114 --> 00:01:58,114
What for?

21
00:01:58,115 --> 00:01:59,532
Yes, what for?

22
00:01:59,616 --> 00:02:02,327
To sing to, to talk to, I don't know.

23
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:06,956
Zev, come on now. You know dead man
only has a limited amount of

24
00:02:07,248 --> 00:02:09,626
He has enough protoblood to last
for months.

25
00:02:09,751 --> 00:02:11,961
Months fly by!

26
00:02:12,045 --> 00:02:13,922
And cryostasis gives him years.

27
00:02:14,547 --> 00:02:16,966
Look, if you wanna sing gorgeous,
sing to me!

28
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:19,844
Sing to me!

29
00:02:33,441 --> 00:02:36,152
I know how to open his pod myself,
you know

30
00:02:36,236 --> 00:02:40,156
Yeah, but I'm almost certified.
It's a delicate machine,
you gotta have the touch.

31
00:02:40,281 --> 00:02:42,158
Exactly - so you're excluded.

32
00:02:42,283 --> 00:02:44,285
Stand aside and let me direct Zev.

33
00:02:44,369 --> 00:02:46,579
I know what I'm doing.

34
00:02:46,663 --> 00:02:48,039
Since when?

35
00:02:49,249 --> 00:02:50,542
Just open it.

36
00:02:55,296 --> 00:02:57,882
Not like that, you got
the order all wrong.

37
00:03:01,094 --> 00:03:03,221
I kill you now in the name
of His Divine Shadow.

38
00:03:04,856 --> 00:03:05,898
Stan!

39
00:03:06,182 --> 00:03:07,267
Oh yeah!

40
00:03:08,977 --> 00:03:09,978
Kai!

41
00:03:10,061 --> 00:03:13,398
We must freeze him, now.

42
00:03:21,281 --> 00:03:25,201
Wait - the key! He has to give
up the key to the Lexx
or we're helpless.

43
00:03:25,326 --> 00:03:27,704
That's true. It's up to you Zev.

44
00:03:27,829 --> 00:03:29,664
A living key must pass to
a living creature.

45
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:35,628
Stanley? Give me the key.

46
00:03:36,796 --> 00:03:39,382
Captain Stan...

47
00:03:39,382 --> 00:03:43,011
Stanley, I need it to save you,
to save us all.

48
00:03:43,094 --> 00:03:45,096
You're cute.

49
00:03:45,221 --> 00:03:47,515
Please Stan, please..

50
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:51,102
I'm late for work -
I gotta - I gotta...

51
00:03:55,607 --> 00:03:57,525
Come on, Stanley, surrender the key!

52
00:04:12,916 --> 00:04:15,627
Surrender the key to me.

53
00:04:16,711 --> 00:04:19,047
Oh yeah.

54
00:04:42,862 --> 00:04:45,240
Isn't it wonderful how some days
turn out?...

55
00:05:02,465 --> 00:05:04,403
I don't understand

56
00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:07,679
why you insist that I keep wasting
countless hours executing your search.

57
00:05:07,762 --> 00:05:09,180
We should be celebrating!

58
00:05:09,305 --> 00:05:10,765
Just keep looking.

59
00:05:10,765 --> 00:05:14,185
As you wish, luscious dish.

60
00:05:14,936 --> 00:05:17,355
The protein regenerator was able
to repair Stan's hand before.

61
00:05:17,356 --> 00:05:19,774
Why wouldn't it work now?

62
00:05:21,276 --> 00:05:22,861
Stan's heart is shattered.

63
00:05:22,986 --> 00:05:26,489
He would suffer brain death
long before we could repair it.

64
00:05:26,573 --> 00:05:28,825
That wasn't your fault, Kai.
It was Stan's.

65
00:05:28,826 --> 00:05:31,077
He didn't work it right.

66
00:05:31,202 --> 00:05:33,288
I am aware of that.

67
00:05:33,371 --> 00:05:35,665
You are not His Shadow's assassin
anymore.

68
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:38,501
Stan might disagree.

69
00:05:38,585 --> 00:05:42,714
But you also saved his life
many times - mine too.

70
00:05:44,549 --> 00:05:48,053
I have ended countless more lives
than I have saved.

71
00:05:49,012 --> 00:05:53,683
No, that wasn't you,
that was His Shadow controlling you.

72
00:05:55,101 --> 00:05:56,895
Ah! Ugh!

73
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:58,021
What?

74
00:05:58,104 --> 00:05:59,397
Horrible news!

75
00:05:59,522 --> 00:06:01,107
What?

76
00:06:01,191 --> 00:06:04,611
There's hope for Tweedle!

77
00:06:04,611 --> 00:06:07,071
This is MedSat medical terminal,

78
00:06:07,072 --> 00:06:09,532
proud home of the finest physicians
in the Quadra system.

79
00:06:10,325 --> 00:06:14,329
If it's broken, we can mend it.
If it's bleeding, we can stem it.

80
00:06:14,412 --> 00:06:18,625
If it's spreading, we can halt it.
If it's sagging we can lift it.

81
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,939
MedSat -
where medicine is at.

82
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:23,129
Professional. Affordable.

83
00:06:23,338 --> 00:06:25,215
Receiving patients now.

84
00:06:27,008 --> 00:06:28,927
Will that do?

85
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:31,221
Lexx -

86
00:06:31,763 --> 00:06:33,431
set course for that satellite.

87
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:35,934
As you request, captain.

88
00:06:51,366 --> 00:06:54,515
MedSat medical terminal,
this is Zev of B3K.

89
00:06:54,516 --> 00:06:57,664
I'm acting captain of
the space vessel Lexx.

90
00:06:58,832 --> 00:07:00,729
We've an emergency with one of
our crew,

91
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:02,627
and we need to bring him aboard.

92
00:07:04,337 --> 00:07:06,006
What is the nature of your
medical emergency?

93
00:07:06,589 --> 00:07:09,050
Our captain has had his heart
badly punctured.

94
00:07:09,843 --> 00:07:11,553
One moment please.

95
00:07:22,564 --> 00:07:25,150
Do you have a Q4A5 planet
insurance waiver?

96
00:07:26,201 --> 00:07:27,260
No...

97
00:07:27,694 --> 00:07:28,778
A D class standard waiver?

98
00:07:30,247 --> 00:07:31,381
Sorry.

99
00:07:32,282 --> 00:07:33,700
Any waivers of any kind?

100
00:07:34,459 --> 00:07:35,577
No.

101
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:37,495
Then cash will be fine.

102
00:07:38,021 --> 00:07:39,113
Pardon?

103
00:07:39,372 --> 00:07:41,333
Precious metals or bankable equivalent.

104
00:07:42,584 --> 00:07:45,962
We have no precious metals
or bankable anything.

105
00:07:47,088 --> 00:07:49,799
Then your situation becomes
a class 1313.

106
00:07:50,392 --> 00:07:51,668
What's that?

107
00:07:51,885 --> 00:07:53,011
Ignored.

108
00:07:53,536 --> 00:07:54,637
You can't do that.

109
00:07:54,637 --> 00:07:57,724
I'm afraid I have no choice.
Policy is policy.

110
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,352
We will pay you, later.

111
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,646
I'm sorry, MedSat does
not accept credit.

112
00:08:04,647 --> 00:08:06,191
This is an emergency!

113
00:08:06,608 --> 00:08:07,806
I understand.

114
00:08:07,807 --> 00:08:09,903
Please inform the next person
to appear on the screen.

115
00:08:11,488 --> 00:08:13,990
Hey, lady - watch.

116
00:08:19,704 --> 00:08:23,917
Lexx - blow up that little
red moon we just passed.

117
00:08:24,501 --> 00:08:26,836
As you command, captain.

118
00:08:52,404 --> 00:08:53,757
I'm Dr Flag

119
00:08:53,758 --> 00:08:55,865
chief administrator of this facility.

120
00:08:58,201 --> 00:09:00,328
I understand that you have
a medical problem?

121
00:09:00,954 --> 00:09:02,372
And a money problem.

122
00:09:04,374 --> 00:09:06,522
We aren't the sort to get
hung up over money,

123
00:09:06,523 --> 00:09:08,670
when a person's life hangs
in the balance.

124
00:09:09,754 --> 00:09:10,714
How can we help?

125
00:09:24,436 --> 00:09:26,604
Once again I apologise
for your initial reception.

126
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,316
Our primary responsibility
is to help people in need

127
00:09:30,317 --> 00:09:33,153
regardless of their financial situation.

128
00:09:33,778 --> 00:09:38,283
I am pleased to inform you that
your captain has been assigned
to a top surgeon,

129
00:09:38,366 --> 00:09:40,702
the very eminent -

130
00:09:40,785 --> 00:09:43,830
Dr Kazan, at your service.

131
00:09:45,373 --> 00:09:48,877
Let me add my voice to the criticism
of your rude welcome.

132
00:09:49,085 --> 00:09:55,258
I promise you that the quality
of surgery here on MedSat is better
than the administration.

133
00:09:56,259 --> 00:09:58,762
They sometimes forget that -

134
00:09:58,887 --> 00:10:01,181
human lives are at stake!

135
00:10:04,726 --> 00:10:05,560
What caused the injury?

136
00:10:06,019 --> 00:10:08,271
I punctured him - with this.

137
00:10:10,774 --> 00:10:11,816
It was an accident.

138
00:10:12,067 --> 00:10:14,361
A beautiful, wonderful accident.

139
00:10:14,611 --> 00:10:16,488
We'll fix him up, as good as new.

140
00:10:17,364 --> 00:10:18,365
Don't knock yourself out...

141
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:19,532
Quiet!

142
00:10:20,367 --> 00:10:23,078
My team is the best of the best,

143
00:10:23,203 --> 00:10:25,643
but this looks like no mere
cardial rupture.

144
00:10:25,644 --> 00:10:28,083
His heart has been pulverised.

145
00:10:28,416 --> 00:10:30,856
I won't feed you any promises but -

146
00:10:30,857 --> 00:10:33,296
what would we be if we didn't try.

147
00:10:33,421 --> 00:10:34,673
Let's go people.

148
00:10:46,267 --> 00:10:47,602
Let's get to work.

149
00:11:23,722 --> 00:11:25,932
Dr Kazan seems to know exactly
what he is doing.

150
00:11:26,433 --> 00:11:28,518
Ha - if he knew what he was doing,

151
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:30,603
he would promptly kill Tweedle
and then himself.

152
00:11:32,272 --> 00:11:34,482
Maybe I should get you rewired
while we're here.

153
00:11:34,899 --> 00:11:37,110
I only say these things because
I'm crazy about you.

154
00:13:24,926 --> 00:13:27,554
He must be some kind of warrior.

155
00:13:27,637 --> 00:13:31,581
- Those clothes, that hair
- That weapon.

156
00:13:31,808 --> 00:13:34,331
There's no question that he's
potentially dangerous -

157
00:13:34,332 --> 00:13:36,855
beautiful incision, doctor.

158
00:13:37,647 --> 00:13:39,733
And yet he's strangely benign.

159
00:13:40,984 --> 00:13:42,027
Curious...

160
00:13:42,569 --> 00:13:44,738
Very curious...

161
00:13:46,364 --> 00:13:47,991
Cauterise that artery, please.

162
00:14:33,453 --> 00:14:35,205
Splendidly done, doctors.

163
00:15:00,389 --> 00:15:01,664
Yea!

164
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:06,695
The dream is over...

165
00:15:34,305 --> 00:15:36,224
I have to admit it was touch and
go there for a while,

166
00:15:36,725 --> 00:15:39,436
but there is no reason your captain
shouldn't make a full recovery.

167
00:15:41,521 --> 00:15:44,024
Thank you Dr. Funz,
Dr. Veezra.

168
00:15:44,449 --> 00:15:45,575
Good luck then.

169
00:15:52,891 --> 00:15:54,067
Thank you.

170
00:15:55,293 --> 00:15:56,419
Good luck.

171
00:15:56,811 --> 00:15:57,870
Thank you.

172
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:08,506
It will be some time before he wakes,
as much as a day or two.

173
00:16:09,299 --> 00:16:10,300
We have some rooms available, if you -

174
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:12,635
Thank you, but I will stay here
with Stanley.

175
00:16:14,054 --> 00:16:15,305
As you wish.

176
00:16:16,264 --> 00:16:18,266
Then perhaps some food
would be in order.

177
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:19,701
I do not eat.

178
00:16:21,269 --> 00:16:23,167
How about you, Zev?

179
00:16:23,168 --> 00:16:25,065
Would you care to join me for dinner?

180
00:16:25,357 --> 00:16:26,441
Oh, I'd like that.

181
00:16:26,442 --> 00:16:27,543
Let's go then.

182
00:16:28,318 --> 00:16:30,612
You are not going anywhere -
Ты тоже не ешьyou don't eat either

183
00:16:30,745 --> 00:16:31,846
But darling -

184
00:16:31,847 --> 00:16:33,093
No, you're going to stay here with Kai.

185
00:16:33,094 --> 00:16:34,616
Stan needs you.

186
00:16:34,741 --> 00:16:36,701
You need me.

187
00:16:36,702 --> 00:16:38,661
to save you from that shifty hack
of a physician!

188
00:16:42,832 --> 00:16:48,088
So heartless. So cruel.
So delicious.

189
00:16:58,682 --> 00:17:02,644
Dr. Kazan! Dr. Kazan!

190
00:17:05,772 --> 00:17:07,023
Dr. Kazan

191
00:17:08,066 --> 00:17:13,446
did you hear? It's official.
I've made a complete recovery.

192
00:17:14,114 --> 00:17:15,990
That's excellent news Mrs. Deebee.

193
00:17:16,491 --> 00:17:19,473
My tumour's gone. My pains are gone

194
00:17:19,474 --> 00:17:22,455
and I've got the rest of my life back.

195
00:17:23,289 --> 00:17:24,749
And all because of you.

196
00:17:26,376 --> 00:17:29,629
I'm only one member of a highly
dedicated team, Mrs Deebee.

197
00:17:30,171 --> 00:17:33,883
Doctor, I am dedicated to you.

198
00:17:36,469 --> 00:17:38,555
Isn't he just so good looking?

199
00:17:41,691 --> 00:17:42,800
Thank you.

200
00:17:47,405 --> 00:17:48,623
Shall we?

201
00:18:09,586 --> 00:18:13,423
The gallant crew of the Lexx.

202
00:18:13,424 --> 00:18:17,260
I have to say that I feel
rather ordinary next to you.

203
00:18:19,095 --> 00:18:20,213
To Zev.

204
00:18:22,974 --> 00:18:24,976
May your every wish be realised.

205
00:18:28,146 --> 00:18:31,107
I - wish to be kissed.

206
00:18:44,829 --> 00:18:47,248
Show me that trick you do with
your hand again.

207
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:50,168
I can do many tricks with my hand.

208
00:18:50,585 --> 00:18:52,587
How exactly did Stan pass it to you?

209
00:18:53,588 --> 00:18:55,277
I don't know...

210
00:18:55,278 --> 00:18:56,966
he transferred it to me as he was dying.

211
00:18:57,717 --> 00:18:59,761
Was it automatic?

212
00:18:59,762 --> 00:19:01,805
or did it require an act
of will on his part?

213
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:04,641
I don't know. I really don't know
how it works.

214
00:19:06,101 --> 00:19:08,853
A beam of energy locked inside your body -

215
00:19:10,689 --> 00:19:14,359
mysterious, alluring, powerful -

216
00:19:15,151 --> 00:19:16,695
very much like you.

217
00:19:17,704 --> 00:19:18,822
Go on...

218
00:19:19,447 --> 00:19:22,617
You have a force, a burning vitality.

219
00:19:24,536 --> 00:19:28,623
I know you. It sounds crazy,
but I do.

220
00:19:29,541 --> 00:19:34,004
You wear your destiny on your skin.
You're one of the chosen

221
00:19:34,879 --> 00:19:36,715
I wouldn't go that far.

222
00:19:38,425 --> 00:19:42,012
Zev - where do you see yourself
in five years?

223
00:19:42,387 --> 00:19:45,682
I don't know - maybe on a nice planet
I can call home.

224
00:19:46,933 --> 00:19:48,893
with someone special.

225
00:19:56,993 --> 00:19:58,153
What's wrong?

226
00:19:58,370 --> 00:19:59,646
I can't do this.

227
00:20:00,564 --> 00:20:01,856
not with you.

228
00:20:03,116 --> 00:20:06,953
I shouldn't have seduced you into
accepting what you already know.

229
00:20:07,629 --> 00:20:08,821
I lied, Zev.

230
00:20:09,706 --> 00:20:10,749
I'm not ordinary.

231
00:20:11,374 --> 00:20:13,460
Not next to you, not next to anybody.

232
00:20:15,128 --> 00:20:17,672
What I really feel is that
you are my equal.

233
00:20:18,631 --> 00:20:21,801
You and me, Zev, are meant to be
partners in greatness.

234
00:20:22,886 --> 00:20:27,098
Your home will not be a hut
on some swampy outback planet -

235
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:28,475
That's not what I had in mind.

236
00:20:28,725 --> 00:20:30,852
- your home will be the entire universe.

237
00:20:32,103 --> 00:20:34,898
aboard the starship Lexx,
with me at your side.

238
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:36,691
You want to join the crew?

239
00:20:37,025 --> 00:20:39,444
We'll be the crew - you and me

240
00:20:39,744 --> 00:20:40,979
What about the others?

241
00:20:41,054 --> 00:20:42,238
Leave them behind.

242
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,115
I can't, not just like that.

243
00:20:44,199 --> 00:20:47,911
Be bold, Zev. don't compromise
yourself for sentiment.

244
00:20:48,244 --> 00:20:50,121
Together we can own the universe.

245
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:53,041
You know this is what you want.

246
00:20:54,042 --> 00:20:56,920
You are one of the chosen,
we both are. Seize your fate.

247
00:20:57,921 --> 00:21:00,131
Can't we just have sex instead?

248
00:21:02,342 --> 00:21:06,054
Look -
I need you. You need me.

249
00:21:06,429 --> 00:21:08,702
We will make a great team.

250
00:21:08,703 --> 00:21:10,975
But if you insist on making a foolish
choice, to stay with the others -

251
00:21:11,059 --> 00:21:12,977
What is so foolish about it?

252
00:21:13,311 --> 00:21:14,554
Stan is weak and pathetic.

253
00:21:14,688 --> 00:21:17,691
Kai is an undead freak of science,
and the robot is a cartoon!

254
00:21:17,982 --> 00:21:19,776
Who do you think you are?!

255
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:25,198
Forgive me my darling. I've offended you.

256
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:32,288
It's just that I - I so hoped
this next step would be unnecessary.

257
00:21:54,853 --> 00:21:58,481
Kazan here. We're away. Be careful.

258
00:22:01,526 --> 00:22:04,320
It couldn't be simpler.

259
00:22:04,321 --> 00:22:07,115
Take me to Zev, come back,
and Stan will still be here.

260
00:22:07,741 --> 00:22:09,200
Zev wants to be alone.

261
00:22:09,451 --> 00:22:12,954
No, she only thinks she wants to be alone.

262
00:22:15,282 --> 00:22:16,499
what was that?

263
00:22:17,717 --> 00:22:18,952
What was what?

264
00:22:19,302 --> 00:22:20,562
I heard something.

265
00:22:27,218 --> 00:22:30,472
Ah! What's that? It's - Zev! Zev!
Zev! Zev!

266
00:23:51,061 --> 00:23:52,220
Hi there.

267
00:23:56,599 --> 00:23:57,600
Everything we want...

268
00:23:57,709 --> 00:23:58,927
Anytime we want it.

269
00:24:00,346 --> 00:24:01,546
Dream it...

270
00:24:01,547 --> 00:24:02,747
Take it...

271
00:24:03,273 --> 00:24:04,373
Status...

272
00:24:04,374 --> 00:24:06,693
Money... A place beyond money.

273
00:24:07,152 --> 00:24:09,195
Power... Raw and unlimited.

274
00:24:09,529 --> 00:24:10,989
And nothing else matters.

275
00:24:11,823 --> 00:24:13,742
First thing we learned in medical school.

276
00:24:13,992 --> 00:24:15,785
We've even got matching tattoos!

277
00:24:16,786 --> 00:24:17,871
Tattoo?

278
00:24:28,298 --> 00:24:32,052
We suspect the key can be released
as an act of will.

279
00:24:33,136 --> 00:24:35,805
We know it can be released
at the point of death.

280
00:24:36,514 --> 00:24:41,436
And as doctors, we know that the will
can be broken at the point of death.

281
00:24:42,062 --> 00:24:44,147
So, better to offer us the key,
if you can.

282
00:24:45,565 --> 00:24:47,692
Should we have to go in there
and try to get it...

283
00:24:47,693 --> 00:24:49,819
things could get ugly.

284
00:24:51,863 --> 00:24:54,449
I used to be ugly.

285
00:24:54,991 --> 00:24:56,826
None of us wants that...

286
00:25:00,664 --> 00:25:02,818
The risks are enormous.

287
00:25:02,819 --> 00:25:07,128
Why die for those ridiculous
characters you call a crew?

288
00:25:09,214 --> 00:25:13,343
We're your friends. They're
your handicap.

289
00:25:15,136 --> 00:25:16,680
My friends?

290
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:21,017
Ah, it could be so special. Good luck.

291
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,990
Bye bye - ah!

292
00:25:48,595 --> 00:25:49,729
You're welcome.

293
00:25:58,388 --> 00:26:00,890
We're ready. Are you?

294
00:26:08,398 --> 00:26:11,818
Dr. Kazan! Dr. Kazan!

295
00:26:15,196 --> 00:26:18,825
Dr. Kazan! Dr. Kazan.

296
00:26:21,244 --> 00:26:22,579
I've looked everywhere for you.

297
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:26,958
Help me. Help me.

298
00:26:27,167 --> 00:26:29,982
My dear, relax.

299
00:26:29,983 --> 00:26:32,797
you've got all the help you need
with our Dr Kazan.

300
00:26:34,674 --> 00:26:36,787
they are releasing me tomorrow,

301
00:26:36,788 --> 00:26:41,014
but I do not want to leave
without thanking you again.

302
00:26:41,222 --> 00:26:44,684
I owe you my life, doctor.

303
00:26:45,226 --> 00:26:50,815
What you owe me, you insipid old cow,
is a fortune in bills.

304
00:26:51,358 --> 00:26:53,735
so trade in your gratitude for some cash.

305
00:26:54,277 --> 00:26:56,780
But doctor, really -

306
00:26:57,197 --> 00:27:01,159
And here's the best part -
there was never anything wrong with you.

307
00:27:01,576 --> 00:27:02,619
not a thing...

308
00:27:03,453 --> 00:27:04,913
You never had a tumour.

309
00:27:05,372 --> 00:27:07,811
We went in, poked around,

310
00:27:07,812 --> 00:27:10,251
messed things up a little
to ensure your speedy return...

311
00:27:10,543 --> 00:27:13,088
emptied your purse
and sewed you shut.

312
00:27:13,463 --> 00:27:16,716
What? I didn't have a tumour?

313
00:27:16,966 --> 00:27:19,969
Mrs. Deebee - you are a tumour!

314
00:27:33,066 --> 00:27:34,898
Last chance, Zev.

315
00:27:35,385 --> 00:27:41,157
Close your eyes, concentrate
and surrender to me.

316
00:27:41,416 --> 00:27:42,542
No.

317
00:27:45,662 --> 00:27:47,664
The hand that heals
becomes the hand that steals.

318
00:27:49,541 --> 00:27:51,418
Let's start with an artery probe.

319
00:28:06,349 --> 00:28:10,020
Look how quickly his flesh
reconstitutes - fascinating.

320
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,230
Perhaps we could dissolve it in acid.

321
00:28:12,689 --> 00:28:15,233
A brilliant idea, from a brilliant woman.

322
00:28:40,342 --> 00:28:42,135
Do you hear me, sir?.

323
00:28:43,261 --> 00:28:44,387
Yes, I can hear you.

324
00:28:44,888 --> 00:28:47,098
I have to say, you are hard to kill.

325
00:28:47,932 --> 00:28:50,226
That has not always been the case.

326
00:28:51,269 --> 00:28:54,564
So, the question is - how do we kill you?

327
00:28:55,565 --> 00:29:01,404
The answer is, I am already dead -
as you soon may be.

328
00:29:01,905 --> 00:29:03,573
I'll bet you're feeling
a little angry right now.

329
00:29:04,199 --> 00:29:05,658
Feelings don't enter into it.

330
00:29:07,118 --> 00:29:09,204
You should be thanking us for our efforts.

331
00:29:10,038 --> 00:29:11,748
For a creature like yourself,

332
00:29:11,749 --> 00:29:13,458
eternal peace would be a blessing.

333
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,086
On some other occasion, perhaps.

334
00:29:17,337 --> 00:29:18,796
The acid didn't work.

335
00:29:18,797 --> 00:29:20,256
Why don't we just keep him frozen?

336
00:29:21,007 --> 00:29:23,802
Because if he ever thaws out,
he will certainly come after us -

337
00:29:24,127 --> 00:29:25,178
won't you, my friend?

338
00:29:25,929 --> 00:29:27,097
Yes I will.

339
00:29:28,098 --> 00:29:30,684
We can blow up MedSat
with him on it when we leave.

340
00:29:31,351 --> 00:29:32,769
That won't stop you, will it?

341
00:29:34,504 --> 00:29:34,563
No.

342
00:29:35,897 --> 00:29:38,191
Besides, I can't resist the challenge.

343
00:29:39,067 --> 00:29:43,196
It seems clear that you will
be able to rematerialise unless

344
00:29:43,613 --> 00:29:45,699
we break you down into subatomic particles.

345
00:29:46,533 --> 00:29:50,870
Our satellite drive is powered by
a plasma beam from the ion furnace.

346
00:29:51,538 --> 00:29:55,500
I'm going to redirect that beam
right into your face.

347
00:29:56,918 --> 00:29:59,462
What do you think of my plan, dead man?

348
00:30:01,548 --> 00:30:02,549
Fire away.

349
00:30:04,217 --> 00:30:06,011
Your plan might break up MedSat too.

350
00:30:06,261 --> 00:30:09,180
Not if I'm smart - which of course, I am.

351
00:30:13,643 --> 00:30:17,022
I used to believe that the doctor thing
was selfless and noble.

352
00:30:17,731 --> 00:30:21,568
I would say "What would we be,
if we didn't try?".

353
00:30:22,152 --> 00:30:23,236
and actually mean it -

354
00:30:24,154 --> 00:30:28,033
then it just became a line.
Guaranteed panty remover.

355
00:30:28,458 --> 00:30:29,617
It worked on you.

356
00:30:30,452 --> 00:30:32,551
Of course, being a love slave

357
00:30:32,552 --> 00:30:36,750
your panties aren't exactly
glued on, are they?

358
00:30:38,001 --> 00:30:40,628
What I do is not noble,
Zev, far from it.

359
00:30:42,213 --> 00:30:44,966
But I do beautiful work.
Perfect work.

360
00:30:46,176 --> 00:30:48,261
on undeserving losers...

361
00:30:49,095 --> 00:30:50,138
Poor you.

362
00:30:51,389 --> 00:30:52,749
Patients are wallets...

363
00:30:53,850 --> 00:31:01,107
wallets with entrails,
and I reach my hands down into those
greasy guts and stitch them up -

364
00:31:01,608 --> 00:31:05,445
for what? Little dribs and drabs of money.

365
00:31:07,155 --> 00:31:12,077
But not any longer,
because I will have the Lexx.

366
00:31:13,078 --> 00:31:14,537
At least you're honest.

367
00:31:15,163 --> 00:31:17,457
Honest, young, gifted and gorgeous!

368
00:31:18,625 --> 00:31:19,876
We don't have to do this, Zev.

369
00:31:21,044 --> 00:31:22,253
Let me have the key.

370
00:31:22,637 --> 00:31:23,713
Never!

371
00:31:27,884 --> 00:31:31,221
Dr. Kazan - I think maybe you
should hold off on the juice

372
00:31:31,846 --> 00:31:32,931
Excuse me?

373
00:31:33,473 --> 00:31:37,602
There's something about her DNA
that's a little - unfamiliar...

374
00:31:38,311 --> 00:31:40,730
She's got the key to the Lexx
buried in it.

375
00:31:41,648 --> 00:31:43,817
Maybe, but that's not what I mean.

376
00:31:44,317 --> 00:31:46,778
I need more time to analyse
her cell structure.

377
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:47,979
You don't have it.

378
00:31:48,321 --> 00:31:50,824
I'm telling you that there are some
truly abnormal elements.

379
00:31:51,157 --> 00:31:52,867
So figure them out, that's your job.

380
00:32:18,768 --> 00:32:21,062
I'm keeping the key.

381
00:32:22,522 --> 00:32:24,023
We'll see about that.

382
00:32:25,025 --> 00:32:29,154
This will sting a bit -
a lot, actually.

383
00:32:50,892 --> 00:32:52,018
Wake up Tweedle...

384
00:32:52,552 --> 00:32:54,203
wake up!

385
00:32:59,434 --> 00:33:01,311
Guh! Wake up.

386
00:33:03,605 --> 00:33:05,440
Tweedle, wake up -

387
00:33:08,985 --> 00:33:11,738
Yes!

388
00:33:12,572 --> 00:33:13,939
Come on!

389
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:35,536
Vital signs?

390
00:33:35,729 --> 00:33:36,788
20%

391
00:33:38,131 --> 00:33:39,315
18%

392
00:33:40,442 --> 00:33:41,551
12%

393
00:33:42,486 --> 00:33:43,511
8%

394
00:33:44,429 --> 00:33:45,780
More.

395
00:33:47,457 --> 00:33:48,658
5%

396
00:33:51,895 --> 00:33:53,121
3%

397
00:33:54,815 --> 00:33:56,024
More.

398
00:33:56,024 --> 00:33:57,333
She'll die!

399
00:33:58,451 --> 00:34:00,537
Die? Maybe...

400
00:34:01,579 --> 00:34:03,581
Obey - certainly.

401
00:34:04,199 --> 00:34:05,675
Give it up Zev.

402
00:34:09,121 --> 00:34:10,246
More.

403
00:34:12,124 --> 00:34:13,241
2%

404
00:34:14,835 --> 00:34:16,185
1%

405
00:34:23,393 --> 00:34:25,028
She's at the point of death.

406
00:34:41,244 --> 00:34:42,662
Well, well - I knew it.

407
00:34:47,342 --> 00:34:48,701
That's right.

408
00:34:50,503 --> 00:34:52,172
that's right...

409
00:34:54,341 --> 00:34:56,426
come to papa...

410
00:34:58,887 --> 00:35:00,513
looking good...

411
00:35:00,764 --> 00:35:01,556
Oh my...

412
00:35:02,098 --> 00:35:03,308
um, doctor?

413
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:04,976
Not now, Berg.

414
00:35:05,393 --> 00:35:06,844
Excuse me, but I insist that -

415
00:35:06,936 --> 00:35:08,938
I said not now, Berg.

416
00:35:11,649 --> 00:35:14,778
I win - again.

417
00:35:16,613 --> 00:35:18,865
Doctor - she's not entirely human.

418
00:35:19,115 --> 00:35:20,700
I can't hear you, Berg.

419
00:35:25,205 --> 00:35:26,665
She's not all human.

420
00:35:27,916 --> 00:35:30,418
Not human? What the hell is she then?

421
00:35:30,835 --> 00:35:32,287
Some kind of reptile.

422
00:35:33,129 --> 00:35:34,572
A reptile?

423
00:37:00,216 --> 00:37:01,751
I saved your captain.

424
00:37:04,062 --> 00:37:05,396
I saved him.

425
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:11,961
I know where Kai is.

426
00:37:13,813 --> 00:37:15,940
If you kill me now,
you don't know where to find him.

427
00:37:19,694 --> 00:37:21,354
I'm too beautiful to die!

428
00:37:39,206 --> 00:37:40,348
Zev!

429
00:37:40,882 --> 00:37:42,842
Zev, where are you, Zev?

430
00:37:43,685 --> 00:37:44,836
It wakes.

431
00:37:46,188 --> 00:37:47,222
Where am I?

432
00:37:47,222 --> 00:37:48,556
MedSat medical terminal.

433
00:37:49,099 --> 00:37:51,601
MedSat? What is this stuff?

434
00:37:52,227 --> 00:37:55,146
The doctors who healed you have taken Zev.
We have to find her!

435
00:38:05,065 --> 00:38:06,507
The wrap!

436
00:38:08,418 --> 00:38:09,953
What's the matter with this thing?

437
00:38:09,953 --> 00:38:12,706
Get the wrap off my eyes,
I'm losing control!

438
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,709
We're gonna hit 'em, do something!

439
00:38:39,816 --> 00:38:41,217
Aah! Eat the robot!

440
00:38:42,694 --> 00:38:44,988
Zev! Is it you?

441
00:38:45,622 --> 00:38:46,865
Zev?

442
00:38:46,865 --> 00:38:49,159
I told you that doctor was a quack.

443
00:38:54,873 --> 00:38:56,166
Come on, follow her.

444
00:38:56,666 --> 00:38:58,335
I'm trying.

445
00:38:58,752 --> 00:39:00,103
Try harder.

446
00:39:00,754 --> 00:39:02,505
I hate you.

447
00:39:03,206 --> 00:39:04,599
Come on!

448
00:39:59,854 --> 00:40:03,483
Wow! And that was just a test.
This is definitely going to work.

449
00:40:04,109 --> 00:40:05,994
OK - full power.

450
00:41:00,248 --> 00:41:02,959
Zev! Darling! No! No!!!!!

451
00:41:17,858 --> 00:41:19,592
We have to do something.

452
00:41:19,726 --> 00:41:21,394
I believe we are too late.

453
00:41:21,811 --> 00:41:22,854
No, no...

454
00:41:26,199 --> 00:41:27,433
Goodbye.

455
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:31,913
Thank you.

456
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:39,746
I had a good life with you guys.

457
00:41:40,789 --> 00:41:43,500
I did all right for a girl
who grew up in a box

458
00:41:44,626 --> 00:41:46,419
You can't die. You can't...

459
00:41:48,597 --> 00:41:50,056
I'll miss you.

460
00:41:57,022 --> 00:41:58,306
Zev...

461
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,062
I love you.

462
00:42:53,778 --> 00:42:55,780
No!

463
00:43:20,272 --> 00:43:21,489
What are you doing?

464
00:43:23,850 --> 00:43:25,426
Bringing Zev home.

465
00:43:51,544 --> 00:43:53,630
Forever, by the Zev, Zev...

466
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,678
Forever by Zev I did lay...

467
00:44:06,768 --> 00:44:09,479
I'm gonna turn the Lexx around.

468
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:12,190
and I'm gonna blow the MedSat
medical terminal into dust! Hear hear!

469
00:44:13,525 --> 00:44:16,778
That's revenge. Do you think
it is an acceptable motivation?

470
00:44:17,237 --> 00:44:18,905
I don't care.

471
00:44:19,698 --> 00:44:21,783
Those who did this to her are already dead.

472
00:44:23,076 --> 00:44:25,870
Well, that's just gonna take
some of the fun out of it.

473
00:44:26,037 --> 00:44:28,456
Zev died saving us.

474
00:44:30,542 --> 00:44:32,202
It would not be her wish.

475
00:44:37,590 --> 00:44:41,386
Yeah, just like her.
Deny me everything.

476
