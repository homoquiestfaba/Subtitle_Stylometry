I'm outta here.
[Laughs]

67
00:03:49,552 --> 00:03:52,521
[Narrator] I'm gonna tell you what
it's really like livin' in the hood.

68
00:03:52,589 --> 00:03:57,526
I moved back into my father's
house after livin' with my moms
for most of my life.

69
00:03:57,594 --> 00:04:01,553
Tray, I don't want you
hangin' out in the streets.

70
00:04:01,631 --> 00:04:03,929
I want you to finish school,

71
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,664
'cause without an education the only
work you're gonna get is sellin' drugs,

72
00:04:08,738 --> 00:04:13,437
pimpin' women or workin'
security for Eddie Murphy.

73
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:15,569
Now, I've done all I can.

74
00:04:15,645 --> 00:04:19,411
I got my education;
I worked two jobs to support you.

75
00:04:19,482 --> 00:04:23,111
But I can't teach you
how to be a man.

76
00:04:23,186 --> 00:04:25,916
Only your father
can do that.

77
00:04:27,023 --> 00:04:29,150
Now gimme a kiss
and be a good boy.

78
00:04:30,727 --> 00:04:33,059
- I love you, Tray. [Blows At Leaf]
- Love you too, Mom.

79
00:04:37,066 --> 00:04:39,000
So, will I see you again?

80
00:04:39,068 --> 00:04:41,161
Sorry, baby.

81
00:04:41,237 --> 00:04:44,695
You know there ain't no positive
black females in these movies.

84

[Tray Narrating] My father tried
his best to give me advice.

85
00:04:57,187 --> 00:05:00,122
The problem was, he was only
a couple of years older than me.

86
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:03,353
[Man] Fool, I told you I don't
want no damn Watchtower!

00:05:03,426 --> 00:05:05,360
Hey, what's up, nigger?

88
00:05:05,428 --> 00:05:07,589

- Oh, how you doin', man?

89
00:05:07,664 --> 00:05:09,598
- How you doin', man?
- How's it goin'?

90
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:12,260
- Oh, man!
- Look at you. It's goin' be on!

91
00:05:12,335 --> 00:05:15,771
- Look at you, man!
Look, you got big, man!
- Oh, you know.

92
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:17,773
Last time I seen you,
you was about this tall.

93
00:05:17,841 --> 00:05:21,106
They wouldn't even let you on
the rides at the amusement park.
Had to take you to kiddie land.

94
00:05:21,177 --> 00:05:23,145
- Remember that?
- Yeah, but it's all good.

95
00:05:23,213 --> 00:05:26,148
- I was just about to eat
breakfast. You hungry?
- No, I'm full, man.

96
00:05:26,216 --> 00:05:29,481
- I had some Red Hots.
- Oh, is that right?
Cool. Hey, man, come on in.

97
00:05:29,552 --> 00:05:33,044
Oh, please allow me.
You're the guest in my house, man.

98
00:05:33,122 --> 00:05:36,216
Make yourself at home.
Hey, are those your Bo's?

99
00:05:36,292 --> 00:05:38,658
- Yeah.
- Hey, I'm gonna be sportin' them, man.

100
00:05:38,728 --> 00:05:41,458
It's good to have you
up in it too.

101
00:05:41,531 --> 00:05:45,490
- I'm gonna finish gettin' my
swollen on right. Have a seat.
- All right. Cool.

102
00:05:45,568 --> 00:05:49,834
Hey! Make sure your
ass is on that plastic.

103
00:05:49,906 --> 00:05:51,999
Look, Tray.
So we're not bumpin' heads.

104
00:05:52,075 --> 00:05:54,635
Man, if you gon' be stayin' here,
you gon' have to follow some rules.

105
00:05:54,711 --> 00:05:58,238
No smokin' my shit.
Don't let me catch you drinkin' my shit.

106
00:05:58,314 --> 00:06:03,843
And if you bring any of them ho's up
in here, make sure I fuck 'em first.

107
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:07,754
And, uh... you gon'
have some chores.

108
00:06:07,824 --> 00:06:09,917
- Chores?
- That's right. Chores.

109
00:06:09,993 --> 00:06:12,154
Nigger, this ain't gon'
be no free ride!

110
00:06:12,228 --> 00:06:14,287
Uh, you gon' have to
keep track of my Matchbox cars.

111
00:06:14,364 --> 00:06:16,958
You got to organize the damn
Sega Genesis cartridges.

112
00:06:17,033 --> 00:06:20,935
Do my homework, since you want
to be such a smart ass.

113
00:06:21,004 --> 00:06:23,370
After that, in the nighttime,
cut the hair on my balls.

114
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:26,101
- Can I ask you a question, Pop?
- Yeah.

115
00:06:26,175 --> 00:06:28,405
What you gon' be doin'?

116
00:06:28,478 --> 00:06:32,608
Hey! Look, nigger, I ain't got
to do nothin'. My mama take care of me.

117
00:06:32,682 --> 00:06:36,243
-[Sighs]
-I know you think I'm bein' hard on you.

118
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:39,288
What the hell. I guess I'm tryin'
to teach you some responsibility.

119
00:06:39,355 --> 00:06:41,846
- You right, Pop.
- No shit.

120
00:06:41,925 --> 00:06:44,860
Hey, could you do me a favor?
Could you line me up in the back?

121
00:06:44,928 --> 00:06:47,396
That's gon' run you
about $13.

122
00:06:47,463 --> 00:06:51,263
Thirteen dollars?
Come on, man. The Spanish dude
down the block only charges six.

123
00:06:51,334 --> 00:06:57,364
- Well, take your ass to him
and let him fuck your head up.
- Nah, I'll let you cut me up.

124
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,307
Hey, Tray, let me
ask you a question, man.

125
00:07:00,376 --> 00:07:02,310
- What's up?
- You still a virgin?

126
00:07:02,378 --> 00:07:04,312
Of course.

127
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:10,250
Well, there was this one dude
who rubbed up against my butt
one time, but I ain't like it.

128
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:13,653
Hey, man, I'm talkin'
about girls, man!

129
00:07:13,723 --> 00:07:17,159
Oh! Girls? C'mon, Pops.
Now, you know I be gettin' mine.

130
00:07:17,226 --> 00:07:20,821
- Mmm. I mean, you gettin' it,
or you gettin' it?
- I'm gettin' it.

131
00:07:20,897 --> 00:07:24,731
- I didn't tell you about
that little honey dip?
- Uh-uh. What honey?

132
00:07:24,801 --> 00:07:27,395
- [Razor Buzzing]
- Oh, Pop, I met the finest
little brown-skinned cutie...

133
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:29,404
down at
the corner market, man.

134
00:07:29,472 --> 00:07:33,374
She had big breasts
and big legs. Ass was-- Pow!

135
00:07:33,443 --> 00:07:35,775
- Ghetto booty! Yes.
- Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

136
00:07:35,845 --> 00:07:38,780
So, you know, I knew she liked me,
'cause we locked eyes.

137
00:07:38,848 --> 00:07:41,783
- Mm-hmm.
- So I started to get into
my mack daddy Denzel mode.

138
00:07:41,851 --> 00:07:46,652
You know? Yeah. So I start fixin' my
eyebrows, make sure they was straight.

139
00:07:46,723 --> 00:07:49,658
Fix my hair, make sure
it was slick and greasy.

140
00:07:49,726 --> 00:07:53,162
- Makin' sure my breath wasn't stinkin'.
- Hey, get to the fuckin' part!

141
00:07:53,229 --> 00:07:55,527
- [Razor Buzzing]
- Oh. Okay. So anyway...

142
00:07:55,598 --> 00:07:58,999
I went over to her house
one Sunday mornin'.

143
00:07:59,068 --> 00:08:01,400
Her moms had
just gone to church.

144
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:08,473
And we had the place
all to ourself.

145
00:08:08,544 --> 00:08:12,207
So you know, we got to kissin',
lickin', slobbin'.

146
00:08:12,281 --> 00:08:15,842
You know, doin' the wild thing.
[Laughs]

147
00:08:18,287 --> 00:08:21,154
- When we got up there,
it was like heaven.
- [Moans]

148
00:08:21,224 --> 00:08:23,522
Better than
my wildest fantasies.

149
00:08:25,495 --> 00:08:28,828
Well, apparently, her moms must have
forgot her purse or somethin',

150
00:08:28,898 --> 00:08:31,093
- [Sniffing]
- 'cause she came back home.

151
00:08:31,167 --> 00:08:35,103
-I guess she could smell sex in the air.
-[Sniffing Continues]

152
00:08:35,171 --> 00:08:37,935
I got a surprise for you.

153
00:08:38,007 --> 00:08:40,475
- And that's when things
really got freaky.

- [Groans]

1120
01:08:00,866 --> 01:08:03,334
- All right, I'm out.
- All right. Hey, hey, hey!

1121
01:08:03,402 --> 01:08:07,202
Before you go, why don't you
read me, like, a bedtime story,
like the good old days?

1122
01:08:07,273 --> 01:08:10,106
- All right. Just one.
- That's all I need.

1123
01:08:10,176 --> 01:08:12,838
All right.

Here we go.

1126
01:08:20,953 --> 01:08:24,616
"This is the story
of Dick and Mary.

1127
01:08:24,690 --> 01:08:28,126
Mary lies on the bed
and spreads her thighs.

1128
01:08:28,194 --> 01:08:31,925
Dick thrusts his large member
into her waiting vagina.

1129
01:08:31,998 --> 01:08:35,525
- 'Fuck me, Fuck me,' Mary screams.
- [Springs Squeaking]

1130
01:08:35,601 --> 01:08:38,069
Dick covers her head with a pillow
'cause she's too noisy.

1131
01:08:38,137 --> 01:08:40,628
- Yeah.
- Dick continues to pound
her swollen opening...

1132
01:08:40,706 --> 01:08:42,640
'til he climates.

1133
01:08:42,708 --> 01:08:46,235
'Oh! I'm coming! I'm coming!
Oh! Oh! Ohh!

1134
01:08:46,312 --> 01:08:49,042
- Yeah. Oh. Oh.
- Oh. Oh.'

1135
01:08:49,115 --> 01:08:52,573
And he falls asleep."

1136
01:08:55,288 --> 01:08:58,689
- Mmm.
- Good night, Pops.

1144
01:09:19,679 --> 01:09:22,773
I got one question.
Who's got that chronic, nigger?

1145
01:09:22,848 --> 01:09:24,873

La Quanda, do you have a boyfriend?

1173
01:11:08,587 --> 01:11:12,580
No. You know, men always seem
to be really intimidated by me.

1174
01:11:12,658 --> 01:11:15,126

I can understand how a pretty girl like
yourself might make a man a little sick.

1178

Oh, I mean nervous.

1179
01:11:26,672 --> 01:11:30,403

- You always this shy, Keisha?
- Mm-hmm.

I guess it'll be all right.

See, I don't want you to think
I'm a freak or nothin' like that,

1212
01:13:27,192 --> 01:13:31,891
because I usually don't even go home
with guys when I first meet 'em.

But I just feel
so comfortable with you.

See, I met this girl.
She's pretty special.

Oh, come on, Pop! Don't tell me
you slept with her too.

Oh, no, no. It ain't
nothin' like that, son.

- She sure could suck a dick, though.
- What?

1248
01:15:39,291 --> 01:15:42,419
Oh, nothing, son. Go ahead.
Tell me about this girl.

01:15:42,494 --> 01:15:46,294
Anyway, I think I'm in love.

You knockin' boobs yet?

- Yeah.
- Hold on.

1252
01:15:51,403 --> 01:15:54,031
You use a condom?

1253
01:15:54,106 --> 01:15:56,040
No.

Yo, never use condoms, son.

now she's pregnant.

Give up hope. Look at me.
Dreams are for suckers.

Ain't no future for you.

1261
01:16:22,568 --> 01:16:25,002
And don't think about
gettin' no job, Tray,

1262
01:16:25,070 --> 01:16:29,029
'cause a black man ain't got no place
in the work force.

1263
01:16:29,108 --> 01:16:31,201
So let me get this straight.

1264
01:16:31,276 --> 01:16:34,803
What you trying to say is, don't get
caught up in the white man's system...

1265
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:36,643
of self-perpetuating
unemployment...

1266
01:16:36,715 --> 01:16:39,513
and wind up trying to survive on
welfare checks and food stamps, right?

1267
01:16:39,585 --> 01:16:42,418
Wrong, man! Hell, ain't nothing wrong
with no welfare check.

1268
01:16:42,488 --> 01:16:47,187
That's called free money. Hell, our
family survived six generations on it.

Thanks, Pop.

1270

It's over here.

01:26:41,553 --> 01:26:45,148
# Beats not worthy of my cause
I prolong extravaganza #

1441
01:26:45,223 --> 01:26:47,214
# Time sits still
No propaganda #

1442
01:26:47,292 --> 01:26:49,726
# Be wary of the skill
as I bring forth the music #

1443
01:26:49,794 --> 01:26:51,193
# Make love to your eardrum #

1444
01:26:51,262 --> 01:26:53,628
# Dedicated to rap
Nigger, beware the fearsome #

1445
01:26:53,698 --> 01:26:55,996
# Lebanon dawn
Malcolm X beat threat #

1446
01:26:56,067 --> 01:26:58,467
# CD Massacre
Murder to Cassette #

1447
01:26:58,536 --> 01:27:00,970
# I blow the shop up
You ain't seen nuttin' yet #

1448
01:27:01,039 --> 01:27:03,405
# One man ran
Tryin' to get away from it #

1449
01:27:03,475 --> 01:27:05,909
# Put your bifocal on
Watch me a-cometh #

1450
01:27:05,977 --> 01:27:08,275
# lnto your chamber
like Freddy into dream #

1451
01:27:08,346 --> 01:27:10,746
# Discomboomerated technique
in your scheme #

1452
01:27:10,815 --> 01:27:13,181
# Four clause applause
Like a blackjack did that #

1453
01:27:13,251 --> 01:27:15,719
# You stuck on stupid
like I'm stuck on the map #

1454
01:27:15,787 --> 01:27:18,187
# Nowhere to go
except next show, bro #

1455
01:27:18,256 --> 01:27:21,282
# Entertain the motherfuckers
Can't stop, oh, in battlin' #

1456
01:27:21,359 --> 01:27:23,054
# You don't want me
to start tattlin' #

1457
01:27:23,128 --> 01:27:25,562
# All up on the stage 'cause
your snakes keep rattlin' #

1458
01:27:25,630 --> 01:27:27,928
# Bitch, you ain't got nothin'
on the rich #

1459
01:27:27,999 --> 01:27:30,297
# Every other day
my ho dress code switch #

1460
01:27:30,368 --> 01:27:32,768
# So just in case you wanna
clock me like Sherry #

1461
01:27:32,837 --> 01:27:35,271
# All y'all crab bitches
ain't got to worry #

1462
01:27:35,340 --> 01:27:37,706
# Can't get a nigger like Don
dime a dozen #

1463
01:27:37,776 --> 01:27:40,074
# Even if I'm smoked out
I can't be scoped out #

1464
01:27:40,145 --> 01:27:42,613
# I'm too ill
I represent Parkhill #

1465
01:27:42,680 --> 01:27:45,046
# See my face
on a twenty-dollar bill #

1466
01:27:45,116 --> 01:27:47,448
# Cashin' in
and get ten dollars back #

1467
01:27:47,519 --> 01:27:49,919
# The phat L.P.
with Cappuccino on the wax #

1468
01:27:49,988 --> 01:27:52,388
# Pass it in your thing
Put valve up to twelve #

1469
01:27:52,457 --> 01:27:54,721
# Put all the other L.P.s
back on the shelf #

1470
01:27:54,793 --> 01:27:57,284
# And smoke a blunt
and dial 9-1-7 #

1471
01:27:57,362 --> 01:27:59,728
# 1-6-0-4-9-3-11 #

1472
01:27:59,798 --> 01:28:02,130
# You could get long dick
hip-hop effects in #

1473
01:28:02,200 --> 01:28:04,532
# I'll damage any MC
who step in my direction #

1474
01:28:04,602 --> 01:28:07,002
# I'm Staten lsland's best son
Fuck what you heard #

1475
01:28:07,071 --> 01:28:09,403
# Nigger still talkin' that shit
is absurd #

1476
01:28:09,474 --> 01:28:11,999
# My repertoire is U.S.S.R. #

1477
01:28:12,076 --> 01:28:14,203
# P.L.O. style
got thrown out the car #

1478
01:28:14,279 --> 01:28:16,839
# And ran over
by the method man Jeep #

1479
01:28:16,915 --> 01:28:19,076
# Divine can't define
My style is so deep #

1480
01:28:19,150 --> 01:28:22,677
# Like pussy, My loc'd up face
stay bushy like a porkypine #

1481
01:28:22,754 --> 01:28:26,451
# I part backs like a spine
Gut you like a blunt
and reconstruct your design #

1482
01:28:26,524 --> 01:28:28,890
# I know you wanna dis me
but I can read your mind #

1483
01:28:28,960 --> 01:28:31,485
# 'Cause you weak in the knees
like S.W.V. #

1484
01:28:31,563 --> 01:28:33,827
# Tryin' to get a title
like Wu Killer Bee #

1485
01:28:33,898 --> 01:28:36,560
# Can't change, you have it
You know I'm friends with the habit #

1486
01:28:36,634 --> 01:28:39,501
# Me and Razor Raw name
printed in the tablet under "best" #

1487
01:28:39,571 --> 01:28:41,436
# We paid our debts
for nine years #

1488
01:28:41,506 --> 01:28:43,303
# Haven't made a sound
and now we out like beers #

1489
01:28:43,374 --> 01:28:46,241
# lnborn power
Born physically power speakin' #

1490
01:28:46,311 --> 01:28:48,973
# The truth in the song
Be the pro-black teachin' ##
