Oh, yeah, you can tell that already?

88
00:06:12,668 --> 00:06:16,728

00:12:48,233 --> 00:12:51,174
She comes straight up to
me, none of that messin'

185
00:12:51,174 --> 00:12:54,234
around, makes it very
clear what she's after.

186
00:12:54,234 --> 00:12:54,893
Uh-huh.

187
00:12:54,893 --> 00:12:55,565
You know what I mean?

188
00:12:55,565 --> 00:12:56,485
Uh-huh, mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm.

189
00:12:56,485 --> 00:13:00,305
Anyhow, she takes me to a fuckin' boat.

190
00:13:00,305 --> 00:13:01,296
A boat?

191
00:13:01,296 --> 00:13:03,235
[Guitarist] Lenny, could
we get some sound up here?

192
00:13:03,235 --> 00:13:05,075
She like, resides on a boat that's

193
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:07,455
docked in Tribeca somewhere.

194
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:10,795
I never heard of such a
thing, I'm tellin' you.

195
00:13:10,795 --> 00:13:13,705
Lenny, could we get some sound up here?

196
00:13:15,595 --> 00:13:17,727
(feedback resonates)

197
00:13:17,727 --> 00:13:20,147
Yeah, you got some sound now?

198
00:13:20,147 --> 00:13:21,559
Thank you.

199
00:13:21,559 --> 00:13:23,419
And before I know it, she's taking

200
00:13:23,419 --> 00:13:27,320
me up to the poop deck and
having her way with me.

201
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,699
On the fuckin' poop deck, man.

202
00:13:29,699 --> 00:13:31,839
In front of all these Halloween freaks

203
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:33,839
that are trudging about, and shit.

204
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:36,459
Can I get some sound on the acoustic?

205
00:13:36,459 --> 00:13:37,410
Hey Lenny, take care of these guys

206
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:39,590
man, I gotta make a phone call.

207
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:44,801
Nicky, hey listen, man.

208
00:13:44,801 --> 00:13:45,792
I'm trying to get in touch with

209
00:13:45,792 --> 00:13:47,603
this girl I met at your party,

210
00:13:47,603 --> 00:13:50,124
she said you invited her.

211
00:13:50,124 --> 00:13:51,764
No, never seen her before.

212
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:54,038
I was leavin' and she disappeared.

213
00:13:55,144 --> 00:13:56,483
Anna.

214
00:13:57,647 --> 00:14:00,247
Yeah, what's her name?

215
00:14:02,155 --> 00:14:05,298
All right, well listen, I'm
at the restaurant, I gotta go.

216
00:14:05,298 --> 00:14:06,672
All right, see ya.

217
00:14:06,672 --> 00:14:08,060
(singer vocalizing)

218
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:09,192
Slimma.

219
00:14:09,192 --> 00:14:10,212
Hey buddy, how are you doin'?

220
00:14:10,212 --> 00:14:10,913
Doin', man.

221
00:14:10,913 --> 00:14:11,912
All right.

222
00:14:11,912 --> 00:14:14,312
You want this?

223
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:17,926
No, you keep it.

224
00:14:28,383 --> 00:14:30,975
(whistles)

225
00:14:36,724 --> 00:14:38,005
(cat meows)

226
00:14:38,005 --> 00:14:42,184
Oh, goodbye Mutt.
(cat meows)

227
00:14:42,184 --> 00:14:44,187
I'll miss you.

228
00:14:44,187 --> 00:14:48,417
(engine revs)

229
00:14:55,928 --> 00:14:57,597
(boxes thud)

230
00:15:05,007 --> 00:15:07,638
(brakes squeak)

231
00:15:15,667 --> 00:15:18,551
(door thuds)

232
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,411
I can't believe I'm getting the hairy

233
00:15:55,411 --> 00:15:56,591
eyeball from those two, what the

234
00:15:56,591 --> 00:15:58,021
hell did you tell them about me?

235
00:15:58,021 --> 00:15:59,061
[Liza] Don't be so paranoid.

236
00:15:59,061 --> 00:15:59,921
No, they're treating me like

237
00:15:59,921 --> 00:16:01,822
the schmucky boyfriend
who walked out on you.

238
00:16:01,822 --> 00:16:03,422
Hmm.

239
00:16:03,422 --> 00:16:05,542
You're the one who's moving out, Liza.

240
00:16:05,542 --> 00:16:08,842
Well, I mean somebody
had to do something.

241
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:09,962
Yeah, I know.

242
00:16:09,962 --> 00:16:13,002
Anyway, you got what
you wanted, you know?

243
00:16:13,002 --> 00:16:15,355
Your freedom. (chuckles)

244
00:16:19,067 --> 00:16:20,566
Oh Susan, that's great, would you just

245
00:16:20,566 --> 00:16:22,644
put that lamp down over
here by the window?

246
00:16:22,644 --> 00:16:24,954
Watch that cord so you don't trip.

247
00:16:26,267 --> 00:16:27,574
(door thuds)

248
00:16:32,904 --> 00:16:33,525
Need some help?

249
00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:36,137
Nah, just move.

250
00:16:47,326 --> 00:16:48,639
(door thunks)

251
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:53,983
That's it.

252
00:16:53,983 --> 00:16:54,963
Well, you wanna come up?

253
00:16:54,963 --> 00:16:56,164
I got a couple of beers in the fridge

254
00:16:56,164 --> 00:16:58,683
and we're gonna order out for pizza.

255
00:16:58,683 --> 00:16:59,525
I'll pass.

256
00:16:59,525 --> 00:17:02,365
All right, well thanks for the help.

257
00:17:02,365 --> 00:17:03,946
Sure.

258
00:17:03,946 --> 00:17:05,746
So, did you have a
good time at the party?

259
00:17:05,746 --> 00:17:06,467
What?

260
00:17:06,467 --> 00:17:07,546
Nick and Rae's party?

261
00:17:07,546 --> 00:17:09,006
Yeah, did you?

262
00:17:09,006 --> 00:17:10,626
Go home with someone?

263
00:17:10,626 --> 00:17:14,309
No, I got stood up to tell the truth.

264
00:17:14,309 --> 00:17:15,408
(car horn honks)

265
00:17:15,408 --> 00:17:17,649
Ah, speak of the devil.

266
00:17:17,649 --> 00:17:19,169
How are you doin', Nick?

267
00:17:19,169 --> 00:17:20,788
You're only an hour and a half late.

268
00:17:20,788 --> 00:17:22,169
Sorry, I lost the address.

269
00:17:22,169 --> 00:17:23,829
That was convenient.

270
00:17:23,829 --> 00:17:24,510
Hey, Liza.

271
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:25,671
Hi, Nick.

272
00:17:25,671 --> 00:17:26,991
So, how'd it go?

273
00:17:26,991 --> 00:17:29,272
It's fine, we're done.

274
00:17:29,272 --> 00:17:30,975
I need a sip of that.

275
00:17:30,975 --> 00:17:33,695
So, you sure you don't wanna come up?

276
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:35,576
I gotta go, you wanna go?

277
00:17:35,576 --> 00:17:36,750
Sure.

278
00:17:37,817 --> 00:17:39,217
So long.

279
00:17:39,217 --> 00:17:41,018
Sam, come here for a minute.

280
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:41,898
Nick, do you mind?

281
00:17:41,898 --> 00:17:43,391
No.

282
00:17:48,342 --> 00:17:50,643
I want you to be careful, OK?

283
00:17:50,643 --> 00:17:51,963
Fine.

284
00:17:51,963 --> 00:17:54,102
I mean, I think I'm doing the right

285
00:17:54,102 --> 00:17:58,013
thing Sam, but I'm not
giving up on us, you know.

286
00:17:58,013 --> 00:18:00,224
I understand.

287
00:18:00,224 --> 00:18:02,644
I don't want you to go
crazy now just because

288
00:18:02,644 --> 00:18:06,054
there's no one around to
call you on it, all right?

289
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:09,060
I gotta go.

290
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,951
Fuckin' nightmare.

291
00:18:10,951 --> 00:18:13,051
I have a feeling I'm
gonna go through that next.

292
00:18:13,051 --> 00:18:15,564
What, with Rae?

293
00:18:17,115 --> 00:18:20,847
Do you want to grab a drink at Gold Bar?

294
00:18:20,847 --> 00:18:22,344
[Sam] Where are we?

295
00:18:22,344 --> 00:18:24,439
(cars rev)

296
00:18:24,439 --> 00:18:25,399
First Avenue.

297
00:18:25,399 --> 00:18:28,849
Let's just go to the Holiday, come on.

298
00:18:35,939 --> 00:18:37,859
(phone ringing)

299
00:18:37,859 --> 00:18:39,399
(classical music)

300
00:18:39,399 --> 00:18:43,079
(pee splashing)

301
00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:45,459
And what did she look like?

302
00:18:45,459 --> 00:18:47,699
[Sam] I can't even remember, man.

303
00:18:47,699 --> 00:18:48,840
Can't even remember.

304
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,401
(silverware clattering)

305
00:18:50,401 --> 00:18:53,612
Is she short, is she tall?

306
00:18:53,612 --> 00:18:55,535
Big hooters?

307
00:18:55,535 --> 00:18:58,594
What she got?

308
00:18:58,594 --> 00:19:01,694
Short-ish, nice figure,

309
00:19:01,694 --> 00:19:04,105
you know, enough to reel me in.

310
00:19:04,105 --> 00:19:08,130
Well, hate to one-up you Sammy boy, but

311
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:12,377
you should see the chick I bang with.

312
00:19:12,377 --> 00:19:15,110
What, the one with the boat?

313
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:17,909
Uh-huh.

314
00:19:17,909 --> 00:19:20,409
She's quite a little number.

315
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:22,150
Been seein' her ever since the party.

316
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:23,729
Oh yeah?

317
00:19:23,729 --> 00:19:24,989
What does Allison think of that?

318
00:19:24,989 --> 00:19:28,170
Oh, fuck Allison.

319
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:31,322
(thuds)

320
00:19:31,324 --> 00:19:33,247
[Sam] Are you all right?

321
00:19:34,796 --> 00:19:38,608
Yeah, actually considering
how much I'm getting laid,

322
00:19:38,608 --> 00:19:40,574
it's amazing how shitty I feel.

323
00:19:40,574 --> 00:19:43,774
You look like shit, dude.
(coughing)

324
00:19:43,774 --> 00:19:44,914
Are you all right?

325
00:19:44,914 --> 00:19:46,694
Yeah, I'm fine.

326
00:19:46,694 --> 00:19:47,854
You goin' to the festival tonight

327
00:19:47,854 --> 00:19:49,594
with Nick and those guys?

328
00:19:49,594 --> 00:19:50,915
Yeah, I'm thinkin' about goin'.

329
00:19:50,915 --> 00:19:52,676
Bring some (mumbles).

330
00:19:52,676 --> 00:19:53,796
[Sam] Are you OK?

331
00:19:53,796 --> 00:19:55,905
[Lenny] Seven o'clock, I'm fine.

332
00:19:55,905 --> 00:19:56,696
[Sam] Man, you need to lay off

333
00:19:56,696 --> 00:19:59,204
the hooch, you look sick as a dog.

334
00:19:59,204 --> 00:20:02,385
(people chatting)

335
00:20:02,385 --> 00:20:06,555
(slow blues music)

336
00:20:10,365 --> 00:20:12,909
[Voiceover] Hey now,
wanna go racin', anybody

337
00:20:12,909 --> 00:20:15,619
else out there wanna get in?

338
00:20:29,967 --> 00:20:31,009
(fire sizzles)

339
00:20:31,009 --> 00:20:32,899
(bell dings)

340
00:20:45,814 --> 00:20:47,575
Hey.

341
00:20:47,575 --> 00:20:49,267
Jesus guys, what's goin' on?

342
00:20:49,267 --> 00:20:51,878
Hey listen, Rae's grandmother died.

343
00:20:51,878 --> 00:20:53,198
Oh, shit.

344
00:20:53,198 --> 00:20:55,308
We got a call this morning.

345
00:20:55,308 --> 00:20:57,221
Rae, are you all right?

346
00:20:57,221 --> 00:20:59,001
Yeah, she's been sick a long time.

347
00:20:59,001 --> 00:21:00,821
I knew it was coming.

348
00:21:00,821 --> 00:21:04,491
(people talking nearby)

349
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,171
Listen, do you guys not want to do this?

350
00:21:11,171 --> 00:21:12,830
She'll be OK.

351
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:14,550
Yeah, I'm fine.

352
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:16,350
God.

353
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:17,551
So, did you find your mystery girl

354
00:21:17,551 --> 00:21:19,170
from the party the other night?

355
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:20,410
No, it's been driving me crazy.

356
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:21,650
I can't even remember what she looks like.

357
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:23,392
She's been the perfect date in my mind.

358
00:21:23,392 --> 00:21:25,877
Where the fuck is Lenny,
is he coming or what?

359
00:21:25,877 --> 00:21:26,747
I don't know man, I saw him this

360
00:21:26,747 --> 00:21:28,187
afternoon, he's looking pretty sick today,

361
00:21:28,187 --> 00:21:30,007
I wouldn't be surprised if he passes.

362
00:21:30,007 --> 00:21:31,979
Fuckin' Lenny, I probably spent a month

363
00:21:31,979 --> 00:21:35,647
of my lifetime over the
years waiting for him.

364
00:21:35,648 --> 00:21:38,339
Listen, I'm gonna get
a beer, anybody else?

365
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:41,719

369
00:21:55,121 --> 00:21:56,152
Anna?

370
00:21:56,152 --> 00:21:57,673
Hi, Sam.

371
00:21:57,673 --> 00:21:59,493
It's really you,
what are you doing here?

372
00:21:59,493 --> 00:22:01,013
You never called me.

373
00:22:01,013 --> 00:22:02,573
You never left your number.

374
00:22:02,573 --> 00:22:03,514
Oh, you never found it.

375
00:22:03,514 --> 00:22:06,476
I left it in your pocket.

376
00:22:06,476 --> 00:22:07,905
Really?

377
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:12,137
I wish you'd waited, I wasn't that long.

378
00:22:12,137 --> 00:22:15,757
I've been trying to find you,
I've been thinking about you.

379
00:22:15,757 --> 00:22:18,389
-I've been thinking about you, Sam.

380
00:22:20,031 --> 00:22:21,271
Listen, I'm with Nick and Rae,

381
00:22:21,271 --> 00:22:23,191
they had that party that night.

382
00:22:23,191 --> 00:22:24,859
We could check out the festival.

383
00:22:24,859 --> 00:22:27,551
I thought I found you alone.

384
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:31,763
It's so amazing to see you again.

385
00:22:31,763 --> 00:22:34,737
- [Anna] You're blushing.
- [Sam] Oh, yeah?

386
00:22:36,767 --> 00:22:39,597
(kisses)

387
00:22:42,429 --> 00:22:46,031
Well listen, I should get this beer

388
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:47,870
back to Nick and maybe we can go

389
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:50,355
off and have a festival on our own.

390
00:22:50,355 --> 00:22:51,216
I'd like that.

391
00:22:51,216 --> 00:22:52,497
Yeah?

392
00:22:52,497 --> 00:22:54,217
Are you gonna wait this time?

393
00:22:54,217 --> 00:22:55,857
Yeah.

394
00:22:55,857 --> 00:22:58,098
I came back the last time,
you weren't there.

395
00:22:58,098 --> 00:22:59,230
I'll be here.

396
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:00,939
All right.

397
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:05,612
I'm sorry you guys,
I've just been so possessed.

398
00:23:05,612 --> 00:23:06,695
I gotta check her out.

399
00:23:06,695 --> 00:23:08,614
So, what should we do?

400
00:23:08,614 --> 00:23:10,455
Lenny's not coming, I can tell you that.

401
00:23:10,455 --> 00:23:13,534
I don't know Nick, why don't
we check out the festival?

402
00:23:13,534 --> 00:23:16,119
Maybe we should just head back uptown.

403
00:23:16,119 --> 00:23:19,731
Go on Sam, you are released.

404
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:22,831

407
00:23:36,851 --> 00:23:39,232
I thought you dooped me.

408
00:23:39,232 --> 00:23:42,963

410
00:24:11,998 --> 00:24:14,440

412
00:24:44,979 --> 00:24:48,011
Ah, this fucker keeps coming.

(slow blues music)

414
00:24:58,904 --> 00:25:01,944
So, what's the truth,
did you crash that party?

415
00:25:01,944 --> 00:25:04,787
[Anna] I heard about it
through someone or other.

416
00:25:06,765 --> 00:25:10,180
I haven't crashed a party in years.

417
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:11,659
There's no parties to crash, everybody

418
00:25:11,659 --> 00:25:14,159
I know has gone their separate ways.

419
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:18,219
So, you've known Rae a long time?

420
00:25:18,219 --> 00:25:21,370
Yeah, we went to school
together when we were kids.

421
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:25,072
We were gonna get married
when we were nine.

422
00:25:25,072 --> 00:25:30,016
Good that's it, please
don't move, don't move.

423
00:25:30,016 --> 00:25:33,487
Five seconds left, please
don't move, don't breathe.

424
00:25:36,538 --> 00:25:37,377
And relax.

425
00:25:37,377 --> 00:25:41,708
Rose, come on, Maria, Maria?

426
00:25:41,708 --> 00:25:45,188
OK girls, OK and relax.

(siren chirping)

429
00:26:04,956 --> 00:26:06,061
Yeah, this is a project that I've

430
00:26:06,061 --> 00:26:07,852
been working on for a little while.

431
00:26:07,852 --> 00:26:11,505
[Sam] That's a lot of work,
hope it gets published.

432
00:26:11,505 --> 00:26:14,288
[Anna] His ticket to immortality.

433
00:26:26,898 --> 00:26:29,739
[Sam] So tell me, Anna, that blowout

434
00:26:29,739 --> 00:26:33,680
back there on the wheel, it's just

435
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:36,873
a, I got a thing about heights.

436
00:26:49,223 --> 00:26:52,095
God, you're so beautiful.

Oh, shit! Ow, shit!

445
00:29:04,397 --> 00:29:07,448
Hey, listen, I need you
to stand-in for Lenny.

446
00:29:07,448 --> 00:29:08,828
No, tonight.

447
00:29:08,828 --> 00:29:10,308
He fucking disappeared, I don't know,

448
00:29:10,308 --> 00:29:12,787
he didn't show up last night either.

449
00:29:12,787 --> 00:29:15,788
Look, fuck.

450
00:29:15,788 --> 00:29:18,008
All right, um, OK thanks.

451
00:29:18,008 --> 00:29:20,348
I'll see you Tuesday, bye.

461
00:29:58,273 --> 00:30:00,742
[Man] This salad has no dressing.

462

Well, it does, if you want a

463
00:30:02,844 --> 00:30:04,845
little more, I can get it for you.

464
00:30:04,845 --> 00:30:07,785
I paid for the dressing,
I'd like to taste it.

465
00:30:07,785 --> 00:30:09,544
Can you bring me a little
container, or something?

Yes, I'll be right back with that.

Hi, Sam.

477
00:30:58,695 --> 00:31:01,176
You found me, incredible.

478
00:31:01,176 --> 00:31:02,955
God, I was wondering what
happened to you last night.

479
00:31:02,955 --> 00:31:05,676
Oh, I tried to wake you,
you were passed out.

480
00:31:05,676 --> 00:31:06,295
Really?

481
00:31:06,295 --> 00:31:07,216
[Anna] Mmm-hmm.

482
00:31:07,216 --> 00:31:09,946
Well you know I've been
workin' late hours.

483
00:31:11,653 --> 00:31:13,913
You like hamburgers?

484
00:31:13,913 --> 00:31:17,119
I may like a good hamburger.

485
00:31:18,748 --> 00:31:21,748
I'm feeling a little light-headed today,

486
00:31:21,748 --> 00:31:25,328
thought I might need some red meat.

487
00:31:25,328 --> 00:31:26,689
You're not a vegetarian are you?

488
00:31:26,689 --> 00:31:28,125
'Cause that wouldn't last too long.

489
00:31:28,125 --> 00:31:29,624
No, not at all.

490
00:31:29,624 --> 00:31:31,367
No?

491
00:31:32,816 --> 00:31:35,093
I could be vegetarian but

492
00:31:35,093 --> 00:31:36,174
there's just too much stuff I couldn't

493
00:31:36,174 --> 00:31:40,133
give up, like lobsters, clams...

494
00:31:40,133 --> 00:31:42,157
I don't think I could do it.

496
00:31:49,418 --> 00:31:51,858
[Anna] What do you do at
the restaurant with the dishes?

497
00:31:51,858 --> 00:31:55,599
(scoffs) Excuse me.

498
00:31:55,599 --> 00:31:59,579
I'm the manager four nights a week.

499
00:32:02,299 --> 00:32:04,430
What about you, do you work?

500
00:32:04,430 --> 00:32:05,490
I work.

501
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:07,071
[Sam] Yeah?

502
00:32:07,071 --> 00:32:09,111
Yeah.

503
00:32:09,111 --> 00:32:11,232
What kind of work?

504
00:32:11,232 --> 00:32:13,171
I don't like to talk about it.

505
00:32:13,171 --> 00:32:15,711
It doesn't really have
anything to do with who I am.

506
00:32:15,711 --> 00:32:17,643
You know what I mean?

507
00:32:18,931 --> 00:32:20,693
Sort of.

508
00:32:20,693 --> 00:32:21,913
Well, how much do you need to

509
00:32:21,913 --> 00:32:24,014
know about someone to
be attracted to them?

510
00:32:24,014 --> 00:32:26,554
Attracted? Nothing.

511
00:32:26,554 --> 00:32:29,297
To stay interested, you
need to fall in love.

512
00:32:29,297 --> 00:32:31,317
Well, I suspect that
the less you know about me,

513
00:32:31,317 --> 00:32:35,197
the longer you'll stay interested.

514
00:32:35,197 --> 00:32:37,017
Why, you have somethin' to hide?

515
00:32:37,017 --> 00:32:39,037
No.

516
00:32:39,037 --> 00:32:40,698
Just that men like to fall in love

517
00:32:40,698 --> 00:32:43,678
don't like to stay in love.

519
00:32:47,978 --> 00:32:52,862
All love ends in sadness,
that's my experience.

520
00:32:52,862 --> 00:32:57,157

I can't offer you a drink.

00:34:56,868 --> 00:35:00,160
Your lip, it's cut.

547
00:35:02,329 --> 00:35:03,790
Oh, yeah.

548
00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:07,530
Or is that herpes?

549
00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:10,470
[Sam] (scoffs) No.

550
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:12,515
What is it then?

551
00:35:12,515 --> 00:35:16,038
Didn't you bite my lip in Battery Park?

552
00:35:16,038 --> 00:35:19,098
[Anna] I didn't think you'd remember.

553
00:35:19,098 --> 00:35:22,043
Sometimes, I can have a good memory.

554
00:35:22,043 --> 00:35:24,655
A little...

555
00:35:28,805 --> 00:35:33,485
Just a little bit at a
time, because I like you.

556
00:35:33,485 --> 00:35:35,877
Sicko.

557
00:35:37,031 --> 00:35:40,521
(people chatting in the distance)

558
00:36:21,936 --> 00:36:24,946
(panting)

559
00:36:29,777 --> 00:36:32,310
Wait, wait.

560
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:40,950
(moaning)

561
00:36:45,641 --> 00:36:48,240
Wait, do you got protection?

562
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,063
Protection from what?

563
00:36:50,063 --> 00:36:52,438
Seriously. Oh, fuck.

564
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:56,898
(moaning)

565
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:05,723
Fuck.

566
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:07,913
(kisses)

567
00:37:20,763 --> 00:37:23,913
(Anna moans)

568
00:37:44,644 --> 00:37:47,873
(exclaims)

569
00:37:53,383 --> 00:37:57,333
(wind chimes chiming)

570
00:37:59,925 --> 00:38:01,586
Ow.

571
00:38:01,586 --> 00:38:04,028
That's protection.

572
00:38:04,028 --> 00:38:07,169
Fair enough, fair enough.

573
00:38:08,227 --> 00:38:11,600
It's not just pregnancy anymore.

574
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,805
I'm not contagious.

575
00:38:13,805 --> 00:38:15,485
All right.

576
00:38:15,485 --> 00:38:19,666
(sighs) You gotta ask, you gotta ask.

577
00:38:19,666 --> 00:38:23,471
(water rippling)

578
00:38:24,937 --> 00:38:28,983
I used to cut my arms at parties.

579
00:38:28,983 --> 00:38:30,761
[Anna] (scoffs) Oh, you're a cutter.

580
00:38:30,761 --> 00:38:33,623
[Sam] See? That's my favorite.

581
00:38:33,623 --> 00:38:36,264
It's got the, it's kind of a map.

582
00:38:36,264 --> 00:38:38,705
[Anna] (chuckles) A cross.

583
00:38:38,705 --> 00:38:40,745
And then I have this one.

584
00:38:40,745 --> 00:38:45,149
You can't see that as well, it's all over.

585
00:38:50,509 --> 00:38:54,396
It's a weird thing to puncture your skin.

586
00:38:54,396 --> 00:38:58,605
Skin is all there is between
you and the rest of the world.

587
00:39:00,835 --> 00:39:03,577
Blood is so eager to get out.

588
00:39:04,795 --> 00:39:07,700
You know it's blue and green?

589
00:39:09,501 --> 00:39:12,931
The oxygen turns it red.

590
00:39:14,261 --> 00:39:16,861
And what about this?

591
00:39:16,861 --> 00:39:20,101
You pull out your teeth at parties, too?

592
00:39:20,101 --> 00:39:22,654
No, I was mugged.

593
00:39:25,164 --> 00:39:30,156
They kicked me in the face,
I lost my tooth.

594
00:39:30,156 --> 00:39:33,419
They got six bucks off me.

595
00:39:35,709 --> 00:39:38,742
I like it.
(Sam chuckles)

596
00:39:49,712 --> 00:39:50,454
(keys clacking)

597
00:39:50,454 --> 00:39:53,335
Well you know, Sam, you might want

598
00:39:53,335 --> 00:39:57,914
to consider that you were
pretty seriously on the rebound.

599
00:39:57,914 --> 00:40:00,314
Yeah, well, I don't know man,

600
00:40:00,314 --> 00:40:01,915
she's got a real ease about her,

601
00:40:01,915 --> 00:40:04,034
kind of a timeless quality.

602
00:40:04,034 --> 00:40:06,775
Uh-huh, Uh-huh.

603
00:40:06,775 --> 00:40:10,355
And you know, she jerked me off
on our first date.

604
00:40:10,355 --> 00:40:14,028
(scoffs) That might have
something to do with it.

605
00:40:16,738 --> 00:40:19,678
We are late for that funeral.

606
00:40:19,678 --> 00:40:21,638
Oh, shit.

607
00:40:21,638 --> 00:40:22,830
Come on, Rae's waiting for us.

608
00:40:22,830 --> 00:40:25,630
All right, let's go, let's go.

609
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:27,470
Come on Nick.

610
00:40:27,470 --> 00:40:29,732
You should come, I know Rae'd want

611
00:40:29,732 --> 00:40:31,671
you there, and what else are you gonna do?

612
00:40:31,671 --> 00:40:33,251
I don't know, something
with Anna I'm hoping.

613
00:40:33,251 --> 00:40:35,771
Well, Anna's invited.

614
00:40:35,771 --> 00:40:37,651
It's gotta be weird for you too, I mean,

615
00:40:37,651 --> 00:40:39,411
the first year without your dad.

616
00:40:39,411 --> 00:40:40,751
Yeah.

617
00:40:40,751 --> 00:40:42,239
What'd you guys used to do?

618
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:44,000
After my mom died?

619
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,460
I don't know, I'd make a
turkey and creamed onions,

620
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:48,479
he'd have some of his cronies over but

621
00:40:48,479 --> 00:40:51,091
last year, he was getting
kind of despondent.

622
00:40:51,091 --> 00:40:55,390
Just wanted to be away so
we ate in this place uptown,

623
00:40:55,390 --> 00:40:57,983
just the two of us, it was pretty dismal.

624
00:40:57,983 --> 00:41:02,385
(bell chimes)

625
00:41:02,385 --> 00:41:05,044
[Nick] Well, come out to the house.

626
00:41:05,044 --> 00:41:08,137
The spirit of grandma will be there.

627
00:41:08,137 --> 00:41:09,908
All right.

628
00:41:09,908 --> 00:41:12,935
(slow classical music)

629
00:41:12,935 --> 00:41:15,605
(bird caws)

630
00:41:28,236 --> 00:41:30,511
[Anna] Sam?

631
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:34,200
Sam?

632
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:37,390
[Sam] Anna, hey, hold on.

633
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:44,100
This is the key to the front door.

634
00:41:51,222 --> 00:41:53,795
(knocking)

635
00:41:57,646 --> 00:41:59,987
- [Sam] Hi.
- [Anna] Hi.

636
00:41:59,987 --> 00:42:01,348
What's that smell?

637
00:42:01,348 --> 00:42:02,667
What?

638
00:42:02,667 --> 00:42:04,167
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

639
00:42:04,167 --> 00:42:06,077
What is it? (sniffs)

640
00:42:06,077 --> 00:42:08,673
You can't smell it, you're
standing in it, I think.

641
00:42:08,673 --> 00:42:10,125
- [Sam] Maybe it's the catbox,
- [Anna] Come here.

642
00:42:10,125 --> 00:42:11,765
- Come here.
- [Sam] Catbox is right there.

643
00:42:11,765 --> 00:42:13,800
[Anna] Look.

644
00:42:15,266 --> 00:42:17,729
Hey, what do you got?

645
00:42:17,729 --> 00:42:19,259
A good BBQ set.

646
00:42:19,259 --> 00:42:21,079
(both chuckle)

647
00:42:21,079 --> 00:42:23,880
We have to use it,
can we get on the roof?

648
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:25,360
Um, yeah.

649
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:26,919
So, we'll have a BBQ.

650
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:27,950
Where did this you get this?

651
00:42:27,950 --> 00:42:29,231
It's really high tech.

652
00:42:29,231 --> 00:42:31,010
14th Street.

653
00:42:31,010 --> 00:42:33,711
You can shop anywhere when
you buy on 14th Street, right?

654
00:42:33,711 --> 00:42:37,831
All right, OK, cool, so we'll

655
00:42:37,831 --> 00:42:39,072
move this operation upstairs.

656
00:42:39,072 --> 00:42:43,066
Great, I'll stay here.

657
00:42:43,066 --> 00:42:45,727
(chuckles) It's not that bad, it's just--

658
00:42:45,727 --> 00:42:48,499
[Sam] All right.

659
00:42:55,370 --> 00:42:56,610
[Anna] Have you ever been naked

660
00:42:56,610 --> 00:42:58,741
on a New York rooftop?

661
00:42:59,790 --> 00:43:03,032
[Sam] Not in this life.

662
00:43:03,032 --> 00:43:06,512
[Anna] What would that be like?

663
00:43:06,512 --> 00:43:09,011
[Sam] You're sort of
an exhibitionist, huh?

664
00:43:09,011 --> 00:43:13,461
(slow romantic classical music)

665
00:43:33,714 --> 00:43:35,904
(horn honks)

666
00:43:58,035 --> 00:44:00,524
(moaning)

667
00:44:05,395 --> 00:44:07,606
(bottles clatter)

668
00:44:13,576 --> 00:44:15,456
(horn honks)

669
00:44:15,456 --> 00:44:17,737
(bottle clatter)

670
00:44:17,737 --> 00:44:20,627
(distant siren)

671
00:44:22,258 --> 00:44:25,808
(Sam moaning)

672
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:32,203
(people talking in the distance)

673
00:44:34,392 --> 00:44:38,593
(phone ringing)

674
00:44:38,593 --> 00:44:42,384
(wind chimes chiming)

675
00:44:48,866 --> 00:44:50,387
[Liza] Hey, are you there?

676
00:44:50,387 --> 00:44:55,148
It's me, um, well, it's been awhile

677
00:44:55,148 --> 00:44:56,329
and I was just wondering how you

678
00:44:56,329 --> 00:45:00,579
were doing and gimme a call someday.

679
00:45:06,623 --> 00:45:09,223
(machine beeps)

680
00:45:16,855 --> 00:45:18,880
It's good to see you.

681
00:45:20,674 --> 00:45:22,790
How you been?

682
00:45:22,790 --> 00:45:27,210
OK, what's been goin' on with you?

683
00:45:27,210 --> 00:45:29,810
You look strung out.

684
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:31,514
I'm running a free life.

685
00:45:31,514 --> 00:45:33,047
[Waitress] Hi.

686
00:45:33,047 --> 00:45:36,399
Yeah, can I have a coffee please?

687
00:45:38,230 --> 00:45:42,810
So, what's been goin' on with you?

688
00:45:42,810 --> 00:45:44,840
Hey did you hear about Lenny?

689
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:46,261
No, what?

690
00:45:46,261 --> 00:45:47,721
[Sam] He's gone missing.

691
00:45:47,721 --> 00:45:51,120
Oh, well what does that mean?

692
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:53,140
He stopped coming to the restaurant,

693
00:45:53,140 --> 00:45:55,621
he never called, nothin'.

694
00:45:55,621 --> 00:46:00,223
Well, isn't he always
threatening to just up and go?

695
00:46:00,223 --> 00:46:03,663
Yeah, well I think it's weird.

696
00:46:03,663 --> 00:46:05,403
(phone rings)
(people laugh)

697
00:46:05,403 --> 00:46:06,724
So what else is new?

698
00:46:06,724 --> 00:46:08,725
How's Nick and Rae?

699
00:46:08,725 --> 00:46:12,589
They're fine, oh, look at this.

700
00:46:12,589 --> 00:46:15,849
I gotta give this speech
tonight about my dad.

701
00:46:15,849 --> 00:46:18,170
[Liza] Hmm, what are you gonna say?

702
00:46:18,170 --> 00:46:20,590
That he liked to travel
and he was never around.

703
00:46:20,590 --> 00:46:22,722
[Liza] (chuckles) Mmm-hmm.

704
00:46:22,722 --> 00:46:24,143
It's a reservation.

705
00:46:24,143 --> 00:46:25,265
The reservation is the two-all,

706
00:46:25,265 --> 00:46:26,924
we can't put them on the air.

707
00:46:26,924 --> 00:46:29,516
I've got this young kid,
he's very telegenic.

708
00:46:29,516 --> 00:46:33,068
So, how's your apartment and stuff?

709
00:46:33,068 --> 00:46:34,707
It's OK, staying at Mark's place

710
00:46:34,707 --> 00:46:37,529
is kind of funny, I guess,
It's sort of a circus.

711
00:46:37,529 --> 00:46:40,409
[Man on Phone] No, listen,
you're calling me.

712
00:46:40,409 --> 00:46:43,269
Well, I'd like to come by and see it.

713
00:46:43,269 --> 00:46:46,550
[Liza] You should, are you all right?

714
00:46:47,969 --> 00:46:49,360
Yeah, I'm fine.

715
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:52,100
[Liza] What happened to your lip?

716
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:53,320
I get that every year, you know,

717
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:55,672
it's herpes or somethin', right?

718
00:46:55,672 --> 00:46:57,625
You seem nervous.

719
00:46:59,572 --> 00:47:01,668
Too much coffee.

720
00:47:04,478 --> 00:47:05,939
I've been feelin' a little weird.

721
00:47:05,939 --> 00:47:08,378
Yeah, like what?

722
00:47:08,378 --> 00:47:10,681
(phone rings)

723
00:47:10,681 --> 00:47:15,378
Liza, I've started seeing somebody.

724
00:47:17,041 --> 00:47:18,601
I'm not saying it's serious or anything

725
00:47:18,601 --> 00:47:23,392
but I just feel like we should
start to say our things over.

726
00:47:24,783 --> 00:47:26,842
We don't have to have
this conversation right now.

727
00:47:26,842 --> 00:47:29,842
I know, I know, it's just so you know.

728
00:47:29,842 --> 00:47:31,683
Oh, well that didn't take long,

729
00:47:31,683 --> 00:47:33,222
how long have you known her?

730
00:47:33,222 --> 00:47:35,763
[Sam] Not that long.

731
00:47:35,763 --> 00:47:38,547
Are you fucking her?

732
00:47:38,547 --> 00:47:39,987
What do you think?

733
00:47:39,987 --> 00:47:41,441
Well, I hope you're being careful.

734
00:47:41,441 --> 00:47:42,621
Liza, come on.

735
00:47:42,621 --> 00:47:44,322
You met her at that
Halloween party, right?

736
00:47:44,322 --> 00:47:46,821
I knew it when I saw you there.

737
00:47:46,821 --> 00:47:48,722
Liza, this isn't a separation if you're

738
00:47:48,722 --> 00:47:50,201
gonna keep quizzing me on everything.

739
00:47:50,201 --> 00:47:51,803
I mean, how is this any
different from living together?

740
00:47:51,803 --> 00:47:53,623
You got me under a fuckin' microscope.

741
00:47:53,623 --> 00:47:54,975
That's not me Sam, that's you

742
00:47:54,975 --> 00:47:56,556
doing that to yourself.
(table thuds)

743
00:47:56,556 --> 00:47:57,815
Ah, shit.

744
00:47:57,815 --> 00:47:59,195
What's the matter?

745
00:47:59,195 --> 00:48:01,486
(Sam breathing heavily)
Are you OK?

746
00:48:01,486 --> 00:48:03,827
I'm fine, I'm fine.

747
00:48:03,827 --> 00:48:05,507
Just a little hung over.

748
00:48:05,507 --> 00:48:07,686
Listen, this was a
bad idea, I'm gonna go.

749
00:48:07,686 --> 00:48:10,247
No, just wait for a minute.

750
00:48:10,247 --> 00:48:12,181
(door creaks)

751
00:48:12,181 --> 00:48:15,941
[Voiceover] (chuckles) Look at you, how

752
00:48:15,941 --> 00:48:18,176
much longer can you keep this up?

753
00:48:20,367 --> 00:48:22,292
[Voiceover] Is she moving out?

754
00:48:22,292 --> 00:48:23,831
[Sam] I'm all packed.

755
00:48:23,831 --> 00:48:26,672
[Voiceover] What's up with you two?

756
00:48:26,672 --> 00:48:30,353
[Sam] Just stuck enjoying
each other, I guess.

757
00:48:33,103 --> 00:48:37,233
(people murmuring)

758
00:48:42,885 --> 00:48:45,064
[Mr. Lyons] That's enough
out of me for this evening.

759
00:48:45,064 --> 00:48:47,344
Now what we all came here for,

760
00:48:47,344 --> 00:48:50,684
to here from his son, Sam.

761
00:48:50,684 --> 00:48:53,654
Let's bring him on.
(crowd claps)

762
00:49:04,224 --> 00:49:05,860
Thank you.

763
00:49:07,584 --> 00:49:11,570
I'm not very helpful in these situations,

764
00:49:11,570 --> 00:49:14,431
(paper rustles)

765
00:49:14,431 --> 00:49:19,431
but I did try to put down a
few thoughts about my father.

766
00:49:21,426 --> 00:49:26,227
I'm thinking about him and I believe

767
00:49:26,227 --> 00:49:30,566
that he never stopped searching,

768
00:49:30,566 --> 00:49:35,127
traveling around,
especially later in life.

769
00:49:35,127 --> 00:49:40,008
I think that he took great comfort in

770
00:49:40,008 --> 00:49:43,868
history and in the past,
he seemed to identify

771
00:49:43,868 --> 00:49:46,929
with the ruins of great civilizations

772
00:49:46,929 --> 00:49:51,109
as monuments to some sort of idealism

773
00:49:51,109 --> 00:49:55,809
which he felt was lacking in the, "Culture

774
00:49:55,809 --> 00:49:58,801
of narcissism," as he liked to call it.

775
00:49:58,801 --> 00:50:03,765
That was Christopher Lasch,
my father liked that phrase.

776
00:50:06,276 --> 00:50:10,636
He had a lot of ambivalence about popular

777
00:50:10,636 --> 00:50:14,728
culture and the media
and I think he felt that

778
00:50:14,728 --> 00:50:19,639
the education system discouraged real

779
00:50:19,639 --> 00:50:23,750
self discovery.

780
00:50:23,750 --> 00:50:27,741
I'm sure you've all discussed
these issues with him.

781
00:50:27,741 --> 00:50:32,741
Anyway, I think that made him

782
00:50:32,741 --> 00:50:37,103
bitter, but he was not

783
00:50:37,103 --> 00:50:42,103
a pessimist or a cynic,

784
00:50:42,104 --> 00:50:46,773
as some of his detractors would have it.

785
00:50:48,020 --> 00:50:52,676
I think...

786
00:50:52,676 --> 00:50:56,496
I think he was an optimist who'd

787
00:50:56,496 --> 00:51:00,630
come up against a lot of disappointments.

788
00:51:06,260 --> 00:51:10,020
But here in this
institution, I think he felt

789
00:51:10,020 --> 00:51:15,019
idealism was still possible and I think

790
00:51:15,019 --> 00:51:19,124
that meant a lot to him.

791
00:51:19,124 --> 00:51:22,584
It meant everything to him.

792
00:51:22,584 --> 00:51:26,115
So, in his honor,

793
00:51:26,115 --> 00:51:29,707
I accept

794
00:51:29,707 --> 00:51:32,961
this memorial.

795
00:51:36,438 --> 00:51:40,329
What I'm sayin' is...
(distant laugh echoes)

796
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:47,640
Thank you, and now maybe we

797
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:50,619
should all get a drink or something.

798
00:51:50,619 --> 00:51:51,720
Thank you.

799
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:54,430
(crowd claps)

800
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:02,299
[Mr. Lyons] Sam.

801
00:52:02,299 --> 00:52:02,991
[Sam] Mr. Lyons.

802
00:52:02,991 --> 00:52:04,511
Are you OK?

803
00:52:04,511 --> 00:52:08,821
Oh, yeah I'm just,
been a little run down.

804
00:52:08,821 --> 00:52:12,174
Well I'm sure all of this
has been pretty hard on you.

805
00:52:12,174 --> 00:52:13,414
[Sam] Yeah.

806
00:52:13,414 --> 00:52:16,055
That was very fine what you said.

807
00:52:16,055 --> 00:52:17,894
It would've meant a lot to your dad.

808
00:52:17,894 --> 00:52:20,514
Thank you, thanks.

809
00:52:20,514 --> 00:52:24,774
How is that girlfriend
of yours, the painter?

810
00:52:24,774 --> 00:52:28,534
Oh, Liza, she's fine, yeah.

811
00:52:28,534 --> 00:52:32,475
Your father was fond of her.

812
00:52:32,475 --> 00:52:34,949
She was studying archaeology, I think.

813
00:52:34,949 --> 00:52:36,710
That's right, very good, yeah.

814
00:52:36,710 --> 00:52:40,742
She's trying to decide
which way to go now,

815
00:52:40,742 --> 00:52:42,982
painting or archeology.

816
00:52:42,982 --> 00:52:45,102
Your father was tickled pink about that.

817
00:52:45,102 --> 00:52:49,303
Oh yeah, they got along very well.

818
00:52:49,303 --> 00:52:51,436
- [Anna] Who's this?
- [Sam] Anna?

819
00:52:51,436 --> 00:52:53,968
Hi, sorry I missed
your speech, how'd it go?

820
00:52:53,968 --> 00:52:56,268
[Sam] It was fine.

821
00:52:56,268 --> 00:52:59,268
Mr. Lyons, this is Anna.

822
00:52:59,268 --> 00:53:03,867
Hi, Jerry Lyons, nice to know you.

823
00:53:03,867 --> 00:53:07,872
[Anna] I'm not interrupting
anything, am I?

824
00:53:07,872 --> 00:53:11,652
Here Sam, I got you something,
in honor of the occasion.

825
00:53:11,652 --> 00:53:14,255
[Mr. Lyons] Oh, nice.

826
00:53:14,255 --> 00:53:15,136
What is it?

827
00:53:15,136 --> 00:53:17,598
How extraordinary!

828
00:53:17,598 --> 00:53:20,297
Peter, come take a look at this.

829
00:53:20,297 --> 00:53:24,677
Come here, take a look at this.

830
00:53:24,677 --> 00:53:27,374
Don't touch, it's for Sam.

831
00:53:30,384 --> 00:53:32,705
What was that all about?

832
00:53:32,705 --> 00:53:34,284
You're not mad that I showed up?

833
00:53:34,284 --> 00:53:35,984
That was just so fuckin' weird.

834
00:53:35,984 --> 00:53:37,567
[Anna] Come on.

835
00:53:41,758 --> 00:53:45,228
(distant siren blares)

836
00:53:56,778 --> 00:53:58,437
Listen.

837
00:53:58,437 --> 00:54:02,057
What are you hearing? I don't...

838
00:54:02,057 --> 00:54:05,133
[Anna] They're out tonight.

839
00:54:06,682 --> 00:54:09,263
What are those, dogs?

840
00:54:09,263 --> 00:54:13,523
Central Park used to be full of wolves.

841
00:54:13,523 --> 00:54:15,663
(horn honks)

842
00:54:15,663 --> 00:54:17,903
(thuds)

843
00:54:17,903 --> 00:54:19,567
Oh, shit!

844
00:54:27,977 --> 00:54:29,757
(growling)

845
00:54:29,757 --> 00:54:32,057
(whooshes)

846
00:54:32,058 --> 00:54:33,340
Anna, come on!

847
00:54:33,340 --> 00:54:36,229
(howling)

848
00:54:39,599 --> 00:54:43,741
(men arguing)

849
00:54:43,741 --> 00:54:45,841
[Man] Don't move him, don't move him.

850
00:54:45,841 --> 00:54:49,442
(water splashing)

851
00:54:49,442 --> 00:54:53,703
Wait, don't move him, put him back in.

852
00:54:53,703 --> 00:54:56,616
Anybody getting the ambulance, or what?

853
00:54:58,625 --> 00:55:00,689
[Sam] Don't touch it, Anna.

854
00:55:00,689 --> 00:55:03,115
[Anna] His little life is slipping away.

855
00:55:03,115 --> 00:55:06,395
[Man] Don't move him, don't move him.

856
00:55:06,395 --> 00:55:08,977
(brakes squeak)

857
00:55:08,977 --> 00:55:11,459
Wait, don't move him, put you back in.

858
00:55:11,459 --> 00:55:12,799
(water splashing)

859
00:55:12,799 --> 00:55:15,039
Anybody getting the ambulance, or what?

860
00:55:15,039 --> 00:55:17,231
[Sam] Jesus, that's a baby?

861
00:55:17,231 --> 00:55:20,223
[Anna] It's the child
we'll never have, Sam.

862
00:55:23,972 --> 00:55:28,143
(hospital chatter)

863
00:55:31,833 --> 00:55:36,692
(slow ominous classical music)

864
00:55:42,612 --> 00:55:46,071
[Sam] Seriously, Anna,
let's get the fuck out of here.

865
00:55:48,855 --> 00:55:50,421
You're being perverse.

866
00:55:50,421 --> 00:55:53,540
[Anna] Take me, Sam,
rub your hard cock against me.

867
00:55:53,540 --> 00:55:55,261
You got a very morbid streak, Anna.

868
00:55:55,261 --> 00:55:56,860
What, and you don't?

869
00:55:56,860 --> 00:55:58,380
I don't know, maybe.

870
00:55:58,380 --> 00:56:00,861
With your scars, Sam?

871
00:56:00,861 --> 00:56:04,280
Drinking yourself into
a stupor every night.

872
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:06,000
[Sam] I got the gloom gene in my family.

873
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,300
(winces) Goddamnit.

874
00:56:15,738 --> 00:56:19,660
(moaning)

875
00:56:36,977 --> 00:56:39,639
(panting)

876
00:56:39,639 --> 00:56:44,108
(slow classical violin music)

877
00:57:05,919 --> 00:57:07,099
Look, I'm fine, all right?

878
00:57:07,099 --> 00:57:08,361
I just need to get home, it's been

879
00:57:08,361 --> 00:57:11,713
a fuckin' intense night, I've had it.

880
00:57:11,713 --> 00:57:14,173
(sighs)

881
00:57:14,173 --> 00:57:15,813
I'll see you tomorrow, we have
the whole weekend, all right?

882
00:57:15,813 --> 00:57:17,153
I'll see you tomorrow?

883
00:57:17,153 --> 00:57:18,113
All right.

884
00:57:18,113 --> 00:57:21,273
All right, I'm sorry, I'm tired.

885
00:57:21,273 --> 00:57:23,106
Be well.

886
00:57:31,479 --> 00:57:33,351
(door thuds)

887
00:57:35,704 --> 00:57:37,478
(horn beeps)

888
00:57:39,143 --> 00:57:40,388
Sam?

889
00:57:40,388 --> 00:57:43,288
Yeah?

890
00:57:43,288 --> 00:57:45,009
[Anna] You like me?

891
00:57:45,009 --> 00:57:48,110
(scoffs) After that?

892
00:57:48,110 --> 00:57:49,962
[Anna] Really?

893
00:57:51,629 --> 00:57:54,293
[Sam] Yeah.

894
00:57:54,293 --> 00:57:57,273
[Anna] Why?

895
00:57:57,273 --> 00:58:01,065
[Sam] I guess...

896
00:58:01,065 --> 00:58:05,234
I guess you seem lonely.

897
00:58:07,044 --> 00:58:09,419
You put up a tough front.

898
00:58:11,445 --> 00:58:14,579
That appeals to me.

899
00:58:14,579 --> 00:58:16,339
[Anna] Why?

900
00:58:16,339 --> 00:58:17,980
Are you lonely?

901
00:58:17,980 --> 00:58:22,472
[Sam] Well, maybe I am.

902
00:58:27,023 --> 00:58:31,323
We live as we dream alone.

903
00:58:31,323 --> 00:58:33,284
Who said that?

904
00:58:33,284 --> 00:58:35,077
[Anna] You did.

905
00:58:36,816 --> 00:58:39,841
[Sam] No, no, it was someone.

906
00:58:47,811 --> 00:58:52,210
[Segundo] Mister Sam, are you OK?

907
00:58:52,210 --> 00:58:54,742
I don't know man.

908
00:58:54,742 --> 00:58:57,894
You don't look so good,
what is the deal?

909
00:59:03,027 --> 00:59:05,360
Mister Sam?

910
00:59:10,110 --> 00:59:11,111
Hi.

911
00:59:11,111 --> 00:59:16,090
(speaks Spanish)

912
00:59:16,090 --> 00:59:18,715
I'm fine man, I'm fine.

913
00:59:21,694 --> 00:59:23,126
Here you go.

914
00:59:24,091 --> 00:59:26,572
(distant horn honks)

915
00:59:27,731 --> 00:59:29,051
She left a message on my machine, she's

916
00:59:29,051 --> 00:59:32,023
going to meet us up there tomorrow.

917
00:59:32,023 --> 00:59:34,425
I'm sorry, I should've checked sooner.

918
00:59:34,425 --> 00:59:35,506
Think nothing of it.

919
00:59:35,506 --> 00:59:38,297
Let's go then before we
get slammed by the traffic.

920
00:59:38,297 --> 00:59:41,617
(soft rock music)

921
00:59:41,617 --> 00:59:43,599
Cut someone off Nick.

922
00:59:43,599 --> 00:59:45,619
I'm trying to get us out there
before Christmas time.

923
00:59:45,619 --> 00:59:47,598
I would not take
the breakdown lane, Nick.

924
00:59:47,598 --> 00:59:49,158
There are cops all over the place.

925
00:59:49,158 --> 00:59:52,019
Now, isn't this nice?

926
00:59:52,019 --> 00:59:54,345
Sheep, you're all sheep.

927
00:59:54,345 --> 00:59:56,642
(horn honks)

928
00:59:56,642 --> 00:59:59,164
Yoo-hoo, Mister Kingfuck?

929
00:59:59,164 --> 01:00:03,605
Hey, Mister Teenage Entrepreneur?

930
01:00:03,605 --> 01:00:06,024
[Rae] Hey asshole,
move over or I'm gonna

931
01:00:06,024 --> 01:00:08,285
come over and kick your balls in.

932
01:00:08,285 --> 01:00:10,585
(laughing)

933
01:00:10,585 --> 01:00:12,645
Kick your balls in?

934
01:00:12,645 --> 01:00:14,832
She means it, too.

935
01:00:14,832 --> 01:00:19,343
#<i> I just wanna be like you #<i>

936
01:00:29,813 --> 01:00:31,883
(light clicks)

937
01:00:39,674 --> 01:00:42,683
Grandma's kitchen.

938
01:00:44,973 --> 01:00:47,644
(clock ticking)

939
01:00:59,953 --> 01:01:02,735
I'm gonna go to bed.

940
01:01:02,735 --> 01:01:05,187
You know where it is?

941
01:01:07,137 --> 01:01:10,047
Yep. (clears throat)

942
01:01:12,218 --> 01:01:14,149
Night.

943
01:01:15,939 --> 01:01:18,149
[Sam] Goodnight.

944
01:01:21,232 --> 01:01:24,863
(distant horn blares)

945
01:01:26,694 --> 01:01:29,025
[Anna] Sam.

946
01:01:40,174 --> 01:01:43,035
Sam.

947
01:02:14,750 --> 01:02:18,420
(bell chimes)
(gasps)

948
01:02:24,250 --> 01:02:28,280
(clock ticks)
(birds chirping)

949
01:02:41,930 --> 01:02:43,990
These were made by Grandma.

950
01:02:43,990 --> 01:02:45,830
Really? That's weird, right?

951
01:02:45,830 --> 01:02:47,210
Very sacred.

952
01:02:47,210 --> 01:02:49,489
Wow, yeah.

953
01:02:49,489 --> 01:02:51,724
Oh, to be cherished.

954
01:02:51,724 --> 01:02:53,225
I wonder what she put in there?

955
01:02:53,225 --> 01:02:54,463
Love.

956
01:02:54,463 --> 01:02:57,647
(distant lawn mower buzzes)

957
01:03:01,256 --> 01:03:03,796
So, Sam?

958
01:03:03,796 --> 01:03:06,216
How's this thing with Anna turning out?

959
01:03:06,216 --> 01:03:08,936
Oh, uh...

960
01:03:08,936 --> 01:03:12,776
it's a...

961
01:03:12,776 --> 01:03:15,759
I don't know, there's
something about her, you know?

962
01:03:18,596 --> 01:03:19,812
Yeah, I can't get a handle on it.

963
01:03:19,812 --> 01:03:23,544
But it's you know...

964
01:03:25,992 --> 01:03:28,993
I'm not really saying anything. (chuckles)

965
01:03:28,993 --> 01:03:30,375
Well, if you're happy.

966
01:03:30,375 --> 01:03:33,556
Yeah, so what about you Rae,

967
01:03:33,556 --> 01:03:36,616
how are things going?

968
01:03:36,616 --> 01:03:38,895
Things are pretty hard right now.

969
01:03:38,895 --> 01:03:39,716
[Sam] Yeah?

970
01:03:39,716 --> 01:03:42,436
I'm trying to make
a major life decision.

971
01:03:42,436 --> 01:03:44,875
Both options are pretty disappointing.

972
01:03:44,875 --> 01:03:46,796
Like, what's goin' on?

973
01:03:46,796 --> 01:03:50,435
Sam, swim in the ocean.

974
01:03:50,435 --> 01:03:51,835
You're kidding.

975
01:03:51,835 --> 01:03:54,615
We must be manly and
go for a dip in the sea.

976
01:03:54,615 --> 01:03:56,536
No, that's impossible man, I'm sick.

977
01:03:56,536 --> 01:03:59,236
Nonsense, good for the circulation.

978
01:03:59,236 --> 01:04:03,195
Anyway, I need the company,
walk me to the beach.

979
01:04:03,195 --> 01:04:05,155
What about you Rae,
you need some help here?

980
01:04:05,155 --> 01:04:07,857
Entertain Nick, that's help enough.

981
01:04:07,857 --> 01:04:11,071
All right, but I may not go in.

982
01:04:13,844 --> 01:04:15,100
We'll finish this later.

983
01:04:15,100 --> 01:04:17,255
Yes.

984
01:04:17,255 --> 01:04:20,304
Bye. Jesus, man.

985
01:04:20,304 --> 01:04:22,615
[Nick] To the sea!

986
01:04:22,615 --> 01:04:24,736
[Sam] What am I supposed
to do with this?

987
01:04:24,736 --> 01:04:27,068
[Nick] You put it on, that's a start.

988
01:04:27,068 --> 01:04:28,500
Then we walk to the ocean, we put

989
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:30,950
our bodies into it, and we swim.

990
01:04:39,471 --> 01:04:42,632
[Sam] So, I told her
it was over, pissed her off.

991
01:04:42,632 --> 01:04:45,237
Come on, we can't return
to the house in defeat.

992
01:04:45,237 --> 01:04:46,558
Look, I'm keeping you company, Nick.

993
01:04:46,558 --> 01:04:47,881
I don't feel well, go in the fucking

994
01:04:47,881 --> 01:04:49,503
water, I'll be your witness.

995
01:04:49,503 --> 01:04:51,743
What is this new frailty
image you're cultivating?

996
01:04:51,743 --> 01:04:53,505
Always the martyr, always the victim.

997
01:04:53,505 --> 01:04:56,046
Don't be unkind, dude.

998
01:04:56,046 --> 01:05:00,727
All right. I'm going in.

999
01:05:00,727 --> 01:05:02,818
(zip unzips)

1000
01:05:02,818 --> 01:05:06,948
(waves crashing)

1001
01:05:13,498 --> 01:05:18,249
(Nick yelling)

1002
01:05:28,168 --> 01:05:31,778
(birds cawing)

1003
01:05:44,808 --> 01:05:49,198
(Nick groaning)

1004
01:05:49,201 --> 01:05:51,687
[Sam] Fucker! Fucker!

1005
01:05:51,687 --> 01:05:53,891
(Nick yells)

1006
01:06:13,215 --> 01:06:15,411
(both yell)

1007
01:06:15,411 --> 01:06:19,821
(heartbeat thumps)

1008
01:06:27,271 --> 01:06:30,800
(birds tweeting)

1009
01:06:33,250 --> 01:06:36,581
(plane engine whirs)

1010
01:06:42,510 --> 01:06:43,653
[Woman] Oh, sorry.

1011
01:06:43,653 --> 01:06:46,143
[Nick] Don't worry, I'm all right.

1012
01:06:47,903 --> 01:06:49,498
- [Rae] So, Nick?
- [Nick] Mmm-hmm?

1013
01:06:49,498 --> 01:06:51,537
No listen, I'm thinking that maybe

1014
01:06:51,537 --> 01:06:55,080
our little process (audio trails off).

1015
01:06:55,080 --> 01:06:56,360
[Nick] What's the matter?

1016
01:06:56,360 --> 01:06:59,120
[Rae] It's Sam, he's looking weird.

1017
01:06:59,120 --> 01:07:02,220
I don't think you should
encourage him drinking.

1018
01:07:02,220 --> 01:07:05,300
This woman Anna is obviously
doing nothing good.

1019
01:07:05,300 --> 01:07:07,580
[Nick] He spends so much time with her.

1020
01:07:07,580 --> 01:07:10,115
It's not about Sam.

1021
01:07:10,115 --> 01:07:12,022
(Nick and Rae argue)

1022
01:07:12,022 --> 01:07:15,346
Everything's about money.

1023
01:07:19,157 --> 01:07:23,066
(phone rings)

1024
01:07:25,756 --> 01:07:29,056
Happy Thanksgiving, Nick.

1025
01:07:29,056 --> 01:07:31,028
Yep.

1026
01:07:34,438 --> 01:07:36,178
[Man] Whoa, are you all right?

1027
01:07:36,178 --> 01:07:38,322
(bird caws)

1028
01:07:38,322 --> 01:07:42,513
(chatter and chuckling)

1029
01:07:53,003 --> 01:07:56,286
(slow dramatic classical music)

1030
01:08:00,935 --> 01:08:02,555
[Man] The Hunter's Moon, now that's

1031
01:08:02,555 --> 01:08:07,306
the name given the full moon in October.

1032
01:08:07,306 --> 01:08:10,061
Hunter, but it's mostly (mumbles).

1033
01:08:10,061 --> 01:08:11,682
(laughs)

1034
01:08:11,682 --> 01:08:13,973
[Man] Sam, the gravy.

1035
01:08:13,973 --> 01:08:17,093
No, every full moon has a name.

1036
01:08:17,093 --> 01:08:19,424
The Harvest Moon, that's
a full moon in September

1037
01:08:19,424 --> 01:08:22,004
and then of course the Blue Moon

1038
01:08:22,004 --> 01:08:26,023
and that's when there's two
full moons in the same month.

1039
01:08:26,023 --> 01:08:27,684
That happens well...

1040
01:08:27,684 --> 01:08:28,623
Once every blue moon.

1041
01:08:28,623 --> 01:08:31,207
[Man] Ah precisely, thank you.

1042
01:08:31,207 --> 01:08:32,507
Rae, you're looking like quite

1043
01:08:32,507 --> 01:08:36,347
the little temptress tonight
in your antique gown.

1044
01:08:36,347 --> 01:08:38,027
It really is beautiful.

1045
01:08:38,027 --> 01:08:39,147
Where'd you get it?

1046
01:08:39,147 --> 01:08:41,167
It was in my grandmother's closet.

1047
01:08:41,167 --> 01:08:44,087
I just put it on and it fit.

1048
01:08:44,087 --> 01:08:46,319
You know, I've never really
been attracted to antiques,

1049
01:08:46,319 --> 01:08:49,343
I always like what's happening now.

1050
01:08:49,343 --> 01:08:52,714
Well, it belonged to my grandmother,
that's why I like it.

1051
01:08:52,714 --> 01:08:53,986
You've got sort of an Emma Peel

1052
01:08:53,986 --> 01:08:56,447
thing going there,
Anna, that's very retro.

1053
01:08:56,447 --> 01:09:00,099
Yeah, well, I pick up a
few things along the way.

1054
01:09:01,909 --> 01:09:04,169
Rae, I'd like a toast, a toast

1055
01:09:04,169 --> 01:09:07,231
to the chef, Rae, thank you so much.

1056
01:09:07,231 --> 01:09:08,120
[Nick] Thank you, Rae.

1057
01:09:08,120 --> 01:09:10,719
Thanks, thanks very much.

1058
01:09:10,719 --> 01:09:12,179
[Nick] And to the glorious hypocrisy

1059
01:09:12,179 --> 01:09:13,699
of the Thanksgiving feast.

1060
01:09:13,699 --> 01:09:16,061
(all whooping)

1061
01:09:16,061 --> 01:09:18,222
And in the principles first embodied

1062
01:09:18,222 --> 01:09:20,114
in The Constitution, the rest we'll

1063
01:09:20,114 --> 01:09:21,337
just leave to that time-honored

1064
01:09:21,337 --> 01:09:24,817
commodity, historical amnesia.

1065
01:09:24,817 --> 01:09:28,016
Anna, you haven't eaten anything,
aren't you hungry?

1066
01:09:28,016 --> 01:09:30,029
[Sam] Anna's never hungry.

1067
01:09:30,029 --> 01:09:31,091
[Rae] Oh really, doesn't that put

1068
01:09:31,091 --> 01:09:32,910
a damper on your courtship, Sam?

1069
01:09:32,910 --> 01:09:35,310
Don't you always cook for your dates?

1070
01:09:35,310 --> 01:09:38,501
[Sam] Now Rae, you're giving away
all of my techniques.

1071
01:09:38,501 --> 01:09:41,143
Now he's cultivating
the ill-health routine.

1072
01:09:41,143 --> 01:09:43,476
[Rae] Oh yes, it's very sexy.

1073
01:09:43,476 --> 01:09:45,375
[Anna] It's OK, Sam,
you already won me over.

1074
01:09:45,375 --> 01:09:47,809
Thank you, and you all...

1075
01:09:47,809 --> 01:09:50,209
(all laugh)

1076
01:09:50,209 --> 01:09:51,869
With my manliness!

1077
01:09:51,869 --> 01:09:53,589
(all chuckle)

1078
01:09:53,589 --> 01:09:55,300
[Nick] Sam and I went swimming today.

1079
01:09:55,300 --> 01:09:56,080
It wasn't so bad.

1080
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:57,554
[Man] That's very sporty of you.

1081
01:09:57,554 --> 01:09:59,754
[Rae] Is he all right?

1082
01:10:03,064 --> 01:10:04,605
Is he all right?

1083
01:10:04,605 --> 01:10:07,325 
Oh, yeah, he just hasn't been
feeling well, lately.

1084
01:10:07,325 --> 01:10:10,029
[Man] Just a change in the weather.

1085
01:10:10,029 --> 01:10:12,790
That's weird that he just walked away.

1086
01:10:12,790 --> 01:10:16,099
(coughing)

1087
01:10:17,654 --> 01:10:21,604
(clock ticking)

1088
01:10:23,797 --> 01:10:28,328
[Voiceover] How is that
girlfriend of yours, the painter?

1089
01:10:28,328 --> 01:10:30,190
Your father was fond of her.

1090
01:10:30,190 --> 01:10:32,460
[Voiceover] Two tickets
for the ride of your life.

1091
01:10:32,460 --> 01:10:36,341
(thunder crashes)

1092
01:10:52,160 --> 01:10:55,701
Oh my God, there you are.

1093
01:10:55,701 --> 01:10:58,684
We thought we lost you.

1094
01:10:58,684 --> 01:11:01,620
(horse chomping)

1095
01:11:09,789 --> 01:11:12,360
(neighs)

1096
01:11:21,310 --> 01:11:23,029
[Rae] Did you see that?

1097
01:11:23,029 --> 01:11:25,310
Yeah, you frightened it.

1098
01:11:25,310 --> 01:11:26,869
What happened to you at dinner, anyway?

1099
01:11:26,869 --> 01:11:28,490
You disappeared.

1100
01:11:28,490 --> 01:11:29,532
Cramps.

1101
01:11:29,532 --> 01:11:32,511
[Rae] Oh really, I got some pills
for that if you need.

1102
01:11:32,511 --> 01:11:36,132
No, I'm feeling better.

1103
01:11:36,132 --> 01:11:39,922
So, what's going on with you and Nick?

1104
01:11:39,922 --> 01:11:41,375
What?

1105
01:11:41,375 --> 01:11:44,195
[Anna] You seem distracted.

1106
01:11:44,195 --> 01:11:45,996
It's a lot of things.

1107
01:11:45,996 --> 01:11:48,629
[Anna] Oh, right. Your grandmother?

1108
01:11:50,015 --> 01:11:51,920
What is your deal, Anna?

1109
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:53,500
[Anna] Excuse me?

1110
01:11:54,649 --> 01:11:55,570
What do you do?

1111
01:11:55,570 --> 01:11:57,330
I don't believe Sam's ever told me.

1112
01:11:57,330 --> 01:11:59,042
I never told Sam.

1113
01:11:59,042 --> 01:12:01,695
Really? (scoffs)

1114
01:12:04,805 --> 01:12:09,695
You and Sam is absurd, I'm sorry.

1115
01:12:10,946 --> 01:12:12,855
Are you still carrying a torch for him?

1116
01:12:12,855 --> 01:12:15,175
I mean, hasn't it been quite some time

1117
01:12:15,175 --> 01:12:18,805
since he used to get drunk
and knock you around?

1118
01:12:24,295 --> 01:12:25,395
I mean, I don't know when you started

1119
01:12:25,395 --> 01:12:27,695
this thing about Rae, but I'll

1120
01:12:27,695 --> 01:12:31,775
tell you, I wouldn't
get too flip about it.

1121
01:12:31,775 --> 01:12:33,475
I mean, she's pretty together.

1122
01:12:33,475 --> 01:12:35,625
Yeah, I know.

1123
01:12:37,195 --> 01:12:40,296
Where is our little cast
of characters, anyway?

1124
01:12:40,296 --> 01:12:43,497
Our little starlets.

1125
01:12:43,497 --> 01:12:46,436
(chuckles) Rae went for a walk,
isn't that what you said?

1126
01:12:46,436 --> 01:12:50,347
Right, right, right.

1127
01:12:52,357 --> 01:12:53,458
It's a good thing too, I would hate

1128
01:12:53,458 --> 01:12:56,599
to think of them upstairs together.

1129
01:12:56,599 --> 01:12:59,319
They seem to dislike each other.

1130
01:12:59,319 --> 01:13:02,132
Yeah, what is that, anyway?

1131
01:13:03,500 --> 01:13:06,732
Have you ever noticed that Rae

1132
01:13:06,732 --> 01:13:11,485
is jealous of every girl you go out with?

1133
01:13:13,935 --> 01:13:15,365
That's in your head, man.

1134
01:13:15,365 --> 01:13:17,768
Open your eyes, man.

1135
01:13:19,618 --> 01:13:22,875
[Anna] Jesus.
(rain pours)

1136
01:13:25,125 --> 01:13:29,085
Ah, your dress is ruined.

1137
01:13:29,085 --> 01:13:32,405
You didn't like it, anyway.

1138
01:13:32,405 --> 01:13:35,145
I like you in it.

1139
01:13:35,145 --> 01:13:37,005
What is this, a come on?

1140
01:13:37,005 --> 01:13:40,860
Well, (scoffs) the setting's so right.

1141
01:13:42,550 --> 01:13:45,110
I've never gotten into that.

1142
01:13:45,110 --> 01:13:46,910
Oh?

1143
01:13:46,910 --> 01:13:49,270
Anyway, there's Nick.

1144
01:13:49,270 --> 01:13:53,010
Oh, is that all it is?

1145
01:13:53,010 --> 01:13:57,403
No, I don't trust you either.

1146
01:13:57,403 --> 01:14:00,168
(glass thunks)
(Sam scoffs)

1147
01:14:03,638 --> 01:14:05,558
(bottle thuds)
Ah.

1148
01:14:05,558 --> 01:14:09,367
(stammers)

1149
01:14:09,367 --> 01:14:12,025
I don't, no, man...

1150
01:14:12,025 --> 01:14:14,185
This is all I need.

1151
01:14:14,185 --> 01:14:17,733
So, if it wasn't me,

1152
01:14:17,733 --> 01:14:22,282
and I wasn't

1153
01:14:22,282 --> 01:14:24,736
with Sam?

1154
01:14:26,884 --> 01:14:31,387
But, I am with Sam you know,

1155
01:14:31,387 --> 01:14:34,449
and he's with me.

1156
01:14:38,609 --> 01:14:40,700
(kisses)

1157
01:14:40,700 --> 01:14:43,729
(thunder crashes)

1158
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:49,969
(rain pouring)

1159
01:15:01,500 --> 01:15:04,250
We don't want to get into this.

1160
01:15:12,520 --> 01:15:14,947
[Sam] Whoo.

1161
01:15:14,947 --> 01:15:16,951
(Nick exclaims)

1162
01:15:21,062 --> 01:15:24,694
I hope Rae is all right in this rain.

1163
01:15:26,404 --> 01:15:29,074
She should be back.

1164
01:15:31,024 --> 01:15:35,315
(slow classical violin music)

1165
01:15:51,264 --> 01:15:55,045
(birds chirping)

1166
01:15:55,045 --> 01:15:59,036
(water drips)

1167
01:16:01,027 --> 01:16:03,567
Look at this piece of shit note.

1168
01:16:03,567 --> 01:16:04,819
We're getting sticked
for the whole weekend,

1169
01:16:04,819 --> 01:16:06,899
they've gone back to New
York, they took the train!

1170
01:16:06,899 --> 01:16:07,549
[Sam] What?

1171
01:16:07,549 --> 01:16:09,900
Nobody even woke me up.

1172
01:16:09,900 --> 01:16:12,916
Well, I can't wait, a whole
weekend being pissed off!

1173
01:16:12,916 --> 01:16:14,316
Exactly.

1174
01:16:14,316 --> 01:16:17,149
We close up the house and get out of here.

1175
01:16:18,538 --> 01:16:20,129
Hey.

1176
01:16:21,938 --> 01:16:24,959
We gotta do all the fuckin' dishes, man.

1177
01:16:24,959 --> 01:16:26,599
(Nick scoffs)

1178
01:16:26,599 --> 01:16:28,730

[Mr. Lyons] Sam, Jerry Lyons here.

1206
01:18:19,515 --> 01:18:20,995
I want to thank you again for the

1207
01:18:20,995 --> 01:18:25,995
other night and listen, I'd like

1208
01:18:25,995 --> 01:18:28,937
to have a word with you
about the young woman

1209
01:18:28,937 --> 01:18:32,928
you brought to the reception if you've

1210
01:18:32,928 --> 01:18:37,271
got a minute or two, give
me a call, we should talk.

1211
01:18:37,271 --> 01:18:41,721
(distant soft rock music)

1212
01:18:58,802 --> 01:19:00,742
(phone ringing)

1213
01:19:00,742 --> 01:19:01,742
Liza.

1214
01:19:01,742 --> 01:19:03,062
[Sam] It's Sam.

1215
01:19:03,062 --> 01:19:04,523
Yeah, Sam?

1216
01:19:04,523 --> 01:19:05,982
[Sam] Happy Holidays.

1217
01:19:05,982 --> 01:19:08,123
What's going on?

1218
01:19:08,123 --> 01:19:09,623
We didn't really get a chance to

1219
01:19:09,623 --> 01:19:11,943
talk, you kind of split on me.

1220
01:19:11,943 --> 01:19:13,262
Well, I mean I don't really need to

1221
01:19:13,262 --> 01:19:14,703
watch you stumble around with a hangover

1222
01:19:14,703 --> 01:19:16,963
Sam, you know I've done
that routine already.

1223
01:19:16,963 --> 01:19:21,003
I wasn't hungover, I'm sick.

1224
01:19:21,003 --> 01:19:22,323
What's the matter with you?

1225
01:19:22,323 --> 01:19:23,668
[Sam] So Liza, do you want to

1226
01:19:23,668 --> 01:19:25,268
get together, just to hang out?

1227
01:19:25,268 --> 01:19:29,086
Um, I don't think so, Sam.

1228
01:19:29,086 --> 01:19:31,646
[Sam] I haven't even seen
your place set up.

1229
01:19:31,646 --> 01:19:33,485
You know, I thought that if I just left

1230
01:19:33,485 --> 01:19:35,105
you alone for awhile, you'd try to

1231
01:19:35,105 --> 01:19:36,886
do something about your drinking Sam,

1232
01:19:36,886 --> 01:19:39,707
you know, decide what you
wanted to do with yourself.

1233
01:19:39,707 --> 01:19:42,986
I didn't think that you'd
be dating in 10 minutes.

1234
01:19:42,986 --> 01:19:46,773
I'm not dating someone,
I just met someone.

1235
01:19:46,773 --> 01:19:48,493
Well, I'm not mad at you if that's

1236
01:19:48,493 --> 01:19:50,614
what you're worried about,
you're off the hook.

1237
01:19:50,614 --> 01:19:54,185
Come on let me come by,
I'll bring a bottle of wine.

1238
01:19:55,936 --> 01:19:57,976
Whatever, I'll bring a bottle of seltzer.

1239
01:19:57,976 --> 01:20:01,276
Oh fuck, no, we'll
make it a bottle of wine.

1240
01:20:01,276 --> 01:20:03,176
[Sam] Is that a yes?

1241
01:20:03,176 --> 01:20:04,427
(clinks)

1242
01:20:04,427 --> 01:20:06,367
Oh, Jesus! You scared me.

1243
01:20:06,367 --> 01:20:07,607
Sorry, I'm late Sam.

1244
01:20:07,607 --> 01:20:09,967
You weren't making other plans, were you?

1245
01:20:09,967 --> 01:20:11,728
What the fuck, Anna?

1246
01:20:11,728 --> 01:20:14,788
Don't be mad.
(Sam panting)

1247
01:20:14,788 --> 01:20:16,157
See.

1248
01:20:17,848 --> 01:20:19,508
What happened to you two last night?

1249
01:20:19,508 --> 01:20:20,689
We went for a walk, when we got

1250
01:20:20,689 --> 01:20:22,769
back, you were both passed out.

1251
01:20:22,769 --> 01:20:24,161
Oh.

1252
01:20:28,020 --> 01:20:31,779
Sam, did you not? Please don't.

1253
01:20:31,779 --> 01:20:33,459
Just be with me tonight, OK?

1254
01:20:33,459 --> 01:20:35,081
We didn't have our weekend together.

1255
01:20:35,081 --> 01:20:37,672
I gotta apologize.

1256
01:20:55,242 --> 01:20:57,232
Liza, are you there?

1257
01:20:57,232 --> 01:20:59,105
Just pick up.

1258
01:21:00,894 --> 01:21:04,765
I'm sorry, I'll call you later.

1259
01:21:07,614 --> 01:21:08,874
(phone receiver clanks)

1260
01:21:08,874 --> 01:21:10,557
No one home?

1261
01:21:10,557 --> 01:21:12,397
I don't get you.

1262
01:21:12,397 --> 01:21:14,178
So, this is what you do, you pine

1263
01:21:14,178 --> 01:21:16,937
away over Liza when I'm not around.

1264
01:21:16,937 --> 01:21:19,238
I was giving her a call,
if you don't mind.

1265
01:21:19,238 --> 01:21:22,398
Sam, I don't want to have to compete

1266
01:21:22,398 --> 01:21:25,070
for your interest, it doesn't feel good.

1267
01:21:28,820 --> 01:21:33,041
Anna, I need some time
to work some stuff out.

1268
01:21:33,041 --> 01:21:36,580
I'm feeling really out of sorts.

1269
01:21:36,580 --> 01:21:39,855
I just, I don't think we should...

1270
01:21:43,405 --> 01:21:45,860
I just need some time.

1271
01:21:47,569 --> 01:21:50,240
I can give you time.

1272
01:21:53,489 --> 01:21:56,470
Anna, wait.

1273
01:21:56,470 --> 01:22:00,051
Did you say something?

1274
01:22:00,051 --> 01:22:03,471
I'm not saying anything.

1275
01:22:03,471 --> 01:22:04,921
Sam, don't worry about it, don't

1276
01:22:04,921 --> 01:22:08,123
lose any sleep over it, I'll get mine.

1277
01:22:10,675 --> 01:22:13,535
Anna...

1278
01:22:13,535 --> 01:22:17,465
(slow dramatic piano music)

1279
01:22:22,796 --> 01:22:25,088
I really...

1280
01:22:29,037 --> 01:22:33,179
I had a thing for you, I just
need some time, all right?

1281
01:22:34,637 --> 01:22:36,879
Right.

1282
01:22:40,369 --> 01:22:43,881
Here's your key, sorry.

1283
01:22:47,321 --> 01:22:49,891
Force of habit.

1284
01:22:52,402 --> 01:22:54,021

1285
01:22:54,021 --> 01:22:56,441

1293
01:23:57,371 --> 01:24:00,820
[Rae] He can't see he's in
total denial about his father.

1294
01:24:14,869 --> 01:24:18,220
[Lenny] Sammy, boy.

1295
01:24:18,220 --> 01:24:21,471
Oh, on the fuckin' poop deck, man.

1296
01:24:25,421 --> 01:24:27,321
[Rae] Already wasted?

1297
01:24:27,321 --> 01:24:31,073
[Anna] So, you've known Rae a long time?

1298
01:24:31,073 --> 01:24:35,164
[Nick] Like all conviction,
the worst are

1299
01:24:35,164 --> 01:24:39,447
full of passion and intensity.

1300
01:24:39,447 --> 01:24:42,746
That should appeal to you
a little bit, right Sam?

1301
01:24:42,746 --> 01:24:47,139
[Man] That's the name given
the full moon in October.

1302
01:24:47,139 --> 01:24:50,126
Hunter, but it's mostly (mumbles).

1303
01:24:50,126 --> 01:24:51,390

1304
01:24:51,390 --> 01:24:54,953
(Anna hisses)
(skin rips)

1305
01:24:54,953 --> 01:24:58,944
[Anna] A little bit at a time,
because I like you.

1306
01:25:02,996 --> 01:25:05,216
(cat hisses)

1307
01:25:05,216 --> 01:25:07,547
[Voiceover] Sam?

1309
01:25:12,156 --> 01:25:14,080

1323
01:26:18,862 --> 01:26:22,803
I'd swing by, offer you a beer.

1324
01:26:22,803 --> 01:26:25,423
No thanks man, I'll pass.

1325
01:26:25,423 --> 01:26:29,860
Yeah? What's the matter?

1326
01:26:29,860 --> 01:26:31,334
Are you sick?

1327
01:26:31,334 --> 01:26:33,392
You were pretty crazy
out there on the road.

1328
01:26:33,392 --> 01:26:34,724
I don't know, man,
I just feel like I'm fallin'

1329
01:26:34,724 --> 01:26:38,136
apart, like my fuckin'
health is failing me.

1330
01:26:41,207 --> 01:26:41,967
What's going on?

1331
01:26:41,967 --> 01:26:44,308
I mean, how do you feel?

1332
01:26:44,308 --> 01:26:45,307
I know what it is, man, it's

1333
01:26:45,307 --> 01:26:48,647
just so fuckin' weird,
I been afraid to tell you.

1334
01:26:48,647 --> 01:26:50,147
[Nick] Yeah, what is it?

1335
01:26:50,147 --> 01:26:53,247
You're a mess.

1336
01:26:53,247 --> 01:26:55,670
It's about Anna.

1337
01:26:55,670 --> 01:26:56,910
Oh, God.

1338
01:26:56,910 --> 01:26:57,732
What?

1339
01:26:57,732 --> 01:27:00,152
Nothing, go on, what about Anna?

1340
01:27:00,152 --> 01:27:02,731
So, you know I broke up
with her last night.

1341
01:27:02,731 --> 01:27:04,672
That was quick, what's that been?

1342
01:27:04,672 --> 01:27:06,151
Two, three weeks?

1343
01:27:06,151 --> 01:27:07,372
Yeah, things went fast like that

1344
01:27:07,372 --> 01:27:10,316
fuckin' chick, she really messed with me

1345
01:27:10,316 --> 01:27:14,097
you know like an animal,
like a fuckin' parasite.

1346
01:27:14,097 --> 01:27:15,516
Yeah, I know what you mean.

1347
01:27:15,516 --> 01:27:17,617
No, you don't have any idea
what I mean, Nick.

1348
01:27:17,617 --> 01:27:19,637
Well, look Sam,
you broke it up with Liza

1349
01:27:19,637 --> 01:27:21,596
so you could be with
Anna, the mystery girl,

1350
01:27:21,596 --> 01:27:23,837
and now things are so fucked up, it's made

1351
01:27:23,837 --> 01:27:26,396
me realize what a turd you are and

1352
01:27:26,396 --> 01:27:28,101
it's made you ill, a sick person.

1353
01:27:28,101 --> 01:27:29,022
That's not what's going on.

1354
01:27:29,022 --> 01:27:29,921
Well, what is it?

1355
01:27:29,921 --> 01:27:31,462
You're being so mysterious.

1356
01:27:31,462 --> 01:27:32,722
What has transpired between you and

1357
01:27:32,722 --> 01:27:34,621
Anna that's making you so crazy?

1358
01:27:34,621 --> 01:27:35,841
Let me tell you this, man.

1359
01:27:35,841 --> 01:27:37,642
I'm all ears, Sam.

1360
01:27:37,642 --> 01:27:39,401
So listen man, like
that first night, right?

1361
01:27:39,401 --> 01:27:42,442
After the festival, so we're gettin' it on

1362
01:27:42,442 --> 01:27:47,001
in Battery Park and she bites into my lip.

1363
01:27:47,001 --> 01:27:49,491
I was wondering what that was,
I was afraid to ask.

1364
01:27:49,491 --> 01:27:50,571
No, I'm serious man, she's biting

1365
01:27:50,571 --> 01:27:52,772
into my lip to draw blood, so I said,

1366
01:27:52,772 --> 01:27:54,111
"What the fuck Anna, what are you doing?"

1367
01:27:54,111 --> 01:27:57,043
And she says, "Oh, just a
little bit at a time, Sam."

1368
01:27:57,043 --> 01:28:01,043
Sticks a finger in the cut
and like, licks the blood off.

1369
01:28:01,043 --> 01:28:02,063
So?

1370
01:28:02,063 --> 01:28:03,845
You don't understand man,
she does it like every time.

1371
01:28:03,845 --> 01:28:05,207
We'll be screwing or something

1372
01:28:05,207 --> 01:28:09,586
and she bites me and then
starts sucking the blood.

1373
01:28:09,586 --> 01:28:10,426
And what are you doing man?

1374
01:28:10,426 --> 01:28:11,987
Are you getting off?

1375
01:28:11,987 --> 01:28:13,387
I don't know man,
it's like totally amazing,

1376
01:28:13,387 --> 01:28:14,747
it's like nothing I've ever felt before.

1377
01:28:14,747 --> 01:28:16,687
It's like when we're screwing it's like

1378
01:28:16,687 --> 01:28:19,507
having warm milk running
through your veins or something.

1379
01:28:19,507 --> 01:28:21,567
What are you saying,
because she's biting you?

1380
01:28:21,567 --> 01:28:23,387
Yeah, I'll wake up and
I'll have this puncture mark

1381
01:28:23,387 --> 01:28:25,787
on my arm or my chest or something.

1382
01:28:25,787 --> 01:28:27,347
I don't get it, I mean,
if she's biting you

1383
01:28:27,347 --> 01:28:29,226
in these different places and then she's

1384
01:28:29,226 --> 01:28:31,607
sucking your blood, actively sucking it?

1385
01:28:31,607 --> 01:28:34,607
Yeah, and then I started
feeling sick like this

1386
01:28:34,607 --> 01:28:36,966
and I started to wonder 'cause
of what happened to Lenny.

1387
01:28:36,966 --> 01:28:39,626
Wait a minute, what does
Lenny have to do with this?

1388
01:28:39,626 --> 01:28:40,547
I'm tellin' you man, before he

1389
01:28:40,547 --> 01:28:43,546
disappeared, he was sick the same way.

1390
01:28:43,546 --> 01:28:44,706
Hold on now, Sam.

1391
01:28:44,706 --> 01:28:47,027
No, I'm serious man, I mean, at first

1392
01:28:47,027 --> 01:28:49,667
I was goin' with it 'cause
it was kind of cool.

1393
01:28:49,667 --> 01:28:51,427
I mean, it's not...

1394
01:28:51,427 --> 01:28:53,007
I don't know, it's just
like our little thing.

1395
01:28:53,007 --> 01:28:54,127
Like me and Anna, right?

1396
01:28:54,127 --> 01:28:55,227
And then I started feeling sick like

1397
01:28:55,227 --> 01:28:56,868
this and out of it and I started

1398
01:28:56,868 --> 01:28:57,988
to realize this fucking chick is like

1399
01:28:57,988 --> 01:29:01,248
drinking my blood in a way
that's affecting my health.

1400
01:29:01,248 --> 01:29:04,187
Sam, you should've stayed in the arts.

1401
01:29:04,187 --> 01:29:06,828
You have such a fertile imagination,

1402
01:29:06,828 --> 01:29:09,887
such a propensity for gothic melodrama.

1403
01:29:09,887 --> 01:29:11,007
I mean, seeing you work in a restaurant

1404
01:29:11,007 --> 01:29:12,848
is like, well, to use your beloved guy

1405
01:29:12,848 --> 01:29:15,709
is like Cyrano without his plume.

1406
01:29:15,709 --> 01:29:16,889
Fuck you, Nick.

1407
01:29:16,889 --> 01:29:18,489
No, fuck you.

1408
01:29:18,489 --> 01:29:20,469
I mean, what is this
concoction you've come up with?

1409
01:29:20,469 --> 01:29:22,689
That Anna is drinking your blood

1410
01:29:22,689 --> 01:29:24,169
and that she's drinking Lenny's blood?

1411
01:29:24,169 --> 01:29:26,310
You haven't gave a fuck
about Lenny disappearing.

1412
01:29:26,310 --> 01:29:27,949
[Nick] Lenny is always disappearing,

1413
01:29:27,949 --> 01:29:29,590
he's an irresponsible fuck.

1414
01:29:29,590 --> 01:29:30,649
No, man, it was Anna.

1415
01:29:30,649 --> 01:29:31,689
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

1416
01:29:31,689 --> 01:29:32,429
Anna what?

1417
01:29:32,429 --> 01:29:34,189
What are you really trying to say, Sam?

1418
01:29:34,189 --> 01:29:35,869
That Anna is sucking your blood

1419
01:29:35,869 --> 01:29:38,229
and that she's sucking Lenny's blood?

1420
01:29:38,229 --> 01:29:41,749
Are you trying to tell
me that Anna's a vampire?

1421
01:29:41,749 --> 01:29:43,191
Get a fucking grip, man.

1422
01:29:43,191 --> 01:29:44,809
Listen, I know it's absurd, but I swear

1423
01:29:44,809 --> 01:29:46,649
to God man, I've never seen her eat,

1424
01:29:46,649 --> 01:29:47,829
I've never seen her drink, I've never

1425
01:29:47,829 --> 01:29:48,990
seen her smoke, I've never seen

1426
01:29:48,990 --> 01:29:50,589
her once, not once, in the daylight.

1427
01:29:50,589 --> 01:29:52,549
I've never seen her take a shit
or piss, for Christ's sake.

1428
01:29:52,549 --> 01:29:54,069
And for that, she's a fucking vampire?

1429
01:29:54,069 --> 01:29:55,789
Because she won't shit in front of you?

1430
01:29:55,789 --> 01:29:57,710
I'm not telling you
she's a vampire, man.

1431
01:29:57,710 --> 01:29:59,489
I'm not asking you to
believe she's a vampire,

1432
01:29:59,489 --> 01:30:00,531
I mean, vampire.

1433
01:30:00,531 --> 01:30:02,451
Well, maybe she thinks she's a vampire,

1434
01:30:02,451 --> 01:30:04,271
maybe she thinks that you think that she's

1435
01:30:04,271 --> 01:30:05,670
a vampire and that's getting you two off.

1436
01:30:05,670 --> 01:30:06,532
Listen man, I'm just telling you what

1437
01:30:06,532 --> 01:30:08,671
I know that this chick does, right?

1438
01:30:08,671 --> 01:30:12,363
She drinks blood! (shudders)

1439
01:30:12,363 --> 01:30:17,123
[Nick] Vampires do not exist,
Sam, and it is unfortunate.

1440
01:30:17,123 --> 01:30:18,843
They would provide much diversion from

1441
01:30:18,843 --> 01:30:21,243
the miseries of life, many
in which you have effectively

1442
01:30:21,243 --> 01:30:22,985
avoided since your mother passed away

1443
01:30:22,985 --> 01:30:24,626
and left you that little nest egg.

1444
01:30:24,626 --> 01:30:26,760
You reveal yourself, Nick.

1445
01:30:26,760 --> 01:30:28,201
Nevermind that then.

1446
01:30:28,201 --> 01:30:32,320
I would prefer to make this point.

1447
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:35,540
Vampirism is everywhere.

1448
01:30:35,540 --> 01:30:37,580
It is hiding in our hearts, Sam.

1449
01:30:37,580 --> 01:30:39,980
It is at the bottom of
a bottle or a needle

1450
01:30:39,980 --> 01:30:42,460
in the arm, it is 500 channels

1451
01:30:42,460 --> 01:30:44,460
of insipid cultural dribble.

1452
01:30:44,460 --> 01:30:46,920
The advertising and gluttony, draining

1453
01:30:46,920 --> 01:30:48,400
us of our ability to think.

1454
01:30:48,400 --> 01:30:50,676
It is the insidious Faustian bargains

1455
01:30:50,676 --> 01:30:53,436
we make every day.

1456
01:30:53,436 --> 01:30:55,436
The little compromises
that eat at our soul

1457
01:30:55,436 --> 01:30:59,597
but believe me, it is not to
be found embodied in Anna.

1458
01:30:59,597 --> 01:31:02,096
She's not that deep.

1459
01:31:02,096 --> 01:31:06,294
Hey, maybe she does drink
blood, I don't know.

1460
01:31:06,294 --> 01:31:07,454
She probaby belongs to one of those

1461
01:31:07,454 --> 01:31:10,353
blood-sucking cults or whatever they are,

1462
01:31:10,353 --> 01:31:14,673
but believe me, she is not a vampire.

1463
01:31:14,673 --> 01:31:18,973
And you, Sam, had better pull yourself

1464
01:31:18,973 --> 01:31:21,053
out of this rut you're going through.

1465
01:31:21,053 --> 01:31:24,293
God forbid, maybe lay
off the booze for awhile

1466
01:31:24,293 --> 01:31:28,513
or whatever it takes to
pull yourself together.

1467
01:31:28,513 --> 01:31:33,353
And if she's been biting you,
I'd get a fucking AIDS test.

1468
01:31:33,353 --> 01:31:37,876
Sounds like very unsafe
sex you've been having.

1469
01:31:37,876 --> 01:31:40,315
You disappoint me, Nick, man.

1470
01:31:40,315 --> 01:31:44,195
I can't even talk to
you, you're so fuckin'...

1471
01:31:44,195 --> 01:31:46,799
It's like you got the shade down.

1472
01:31:48,868 --> 01:31:53,250
Sam, what do you want me to say?

1473
01:31:53,250 --> 01:31:54,850
I mean, really.

1474
01:31:54,850 --> 01:31:58,270
I just want to tell you
the shit that's been goin' on.

1475
01:31:58,270 --> 01:31:59,610
Sure.

1476
01:31:59,610 --> 01:32:02,851
[Sam] Have you say,
you know, "It's all right."

1477
01:32:02,851 --> 01:32:04,170
Yeah, Sam.

1478
01:32:04,170 --> 01:32:06,450
And, "It's over."

1479
01:32:06,450 --> 01:32:09,070
It's over, Sam, you're gonna be fine.

1480
01:32:09,070 --> 01:32:12,332
I'm scared man, I feel
like I'm cracking up.

1481
01:32:15,382 --> 01:32:19,829
Listen, come have a
drink with us, Rae and me.

1482
01:32:19,829 --> 01:32:21,362
[Sam] I told you man, I'm not drinking.

1483
01:32:21,362 --> 01:32:22,882
You should be drinking, it's probably

1484
01:32:22,882 --> 01:32:24,823
the best thing for a man in your shoes.

1485
01:32:24,823 --> 01:32:27,184
(Sam chuckles)

1486
01:32:30,534 --> 01:32:33,394
[Sam] Why don't you
just get out of here?

1487
01:32:33,394 --> 01:32:38,090
Sure, you take care of yourself.

1488
01:32:38,090 --> 01:32:42,988
Maybe you are really sick.

1489
01:32:47,117 --> 01:32:49,917
Like, maybe you should talk to someone.

1490
01:32:49,917 --> 01:32:53,244
I will Nick, you can come
visit me at The Creedmoor.

1491
01:32:53,244 --> 01:32:56,625
Look, Sam, your father
died two months ago,

1492
01:32:56,625 --> 01:32:59,005
he'd been away, he stopped calling.

1493
01:32:59,005 --> 01:33:01,704
It looks like he died
on a binge or something,

1494
01:33:01,704 --> 01:33:05,644
you're feeling unresolved,
you've got a right to.

1495
01:33:05,644 --> 01:33:07,784
Look, all I'm trying
to say is I don't think

1496
01:33:07,784 --> 01:33:09,606
Anna is your problem, OK?

1497
01:33:09,606 --> 01:33:12,985
I hear you, dude.

1498
01:33:12,985 --> 01:33:14,646
[Nick] All right.

1499
01:33:16,171 --> 01:33:19,510
Look, take care, OK?

1500
01:33:22,641 --> 01:33:27,031
Call me, and tell me
what Freud has to say.

1501
01:33:39,283 --> 01:33:42,043
(door creaks)

1502

1505
01:34:10,073 --> 01:34:12,724
Mutt?

1506
01:34:15,393 --> 01:34:17,864
Mutt.

1507
01:34:22,093 --> 01:34:24,053
Yo, mutt.

1508
01:34:24,053 --> 01:34:28,134

1510
01:35:11,147 --> 01:35:13,477
Oh, crap.

(exclaims)

1512
01:35:27,027 --> 01:35:30,628
Liza, Liza, it's Sam.

1513
01:35:30,628 --> 01:35:35,228
Listen, I'm in trouble,
you gotta come over.

1514
01:35:35,228 --> 01:35:38,058
OK, please?

1515
01:35:38,058 --> 01:35:42,042
OK, I think I'm cracking up.

1516
01:35:43,191 --> 01:35:44,417

1521
01:36:47,074 --> 01:36:49,188
Liza.

1522
01:36:51,459 --> 01:36:53,292
Liza?

1523
01:36:55,198 --> 01:36:56,962
I remember you.

1524
01:36:56,962 --> 01:37:00,283
Have you seen Liza,
the woman that lives here?

1525
01:37:00,283 --> 01:37:03,092
I don't want no trouble here.

1526
01:37:25,683 --> 01:37:28,192
(door creaks)

1527
01:37:29,362 --> 01:37:31,212
Liza?

1528
01:37:41,542 --> 01:37:43,962
(gasps)

1529
01:37:43,962 --> 01:37:47,357
Liza, Liza, Liza.

1530
01:37:55,047 --> 01:37:57,831
[Voiceover] There's trouble
at the neighbor's apartment.

1531
01:37:58,978 --> 01:38:01,961
That's right, picking the lock.

1532
01:38:01,961 --> 01:38:05,453
That's right, I heard a lot of voices.

1533
01:38:07,904 --> 01:38:11,914
He's still in there, that's right.

1534
01:38:14,113 --> 01:38:17,983
You're gonna catch him if you hurry.

1535
01:38:19,293 --> 01:38:23,723

[Voiceover] Anna's sucking your

1539
01:39:05,047 --> 01:39:07,389
blood, she's sucking Lenny's blood?

1540
01:39:07,389 --> 01:39:09,488
[Voiceover] I'll never forget her.

1541
01:39:09,488 --> 01:39:10,300
[Nick] Are you trying to tell me

1542
01:39:10,300 --> 01:39:12,691
that Anna's a vampire?

1543
01:39:12,691 --> 01:39:14,171
Get a fucking grip.

1544
01:39:16,832 --> 01:39:18,253
[Nick] What are you
really trying to say, Sam?

1545
01:39:18,253 --> 01:39:19,993
That Anna's sucking your blood

1546
01:39:19,993 --> 01:39:22,183
and sucking Lenny's blood?

1547
01:39:23,633 --> 01:39:27,943
[Mr. Lyons] How is that
girlfriend of yours, the painter?

1548
01:39:27,943 --> 01:39:30,813
Your father was fond of her.

1549
01:39:34,183 --> 01:39:35,043
[Nick] Are you trying to tell me

1550
01:39:35,043 --> 01:39:37,543
that Anna's a vampire?

1551
01:39:37,543 --> 01:39:38,805
Get a fucking grip.

1552
01:39:38,805 --> 01:39:40,445
[Anna] I don't want to have to compete

1553
01:39:40,445 --> 01:39:44,125
for your interest, it doesn't feel good.

1554
01:39:44,125 --> 01:39:48,455
[Mr. Lyons] How is that
girlfriend of yours, the painter?

1555
01:39:52,485 --> 01:39:57,119

1556

[Voicemail Message]
This is a crucial moment.

1557
01:40:21,757 --> 01:40:26,386
Leave a message for Nick
or Rae after the beep.

Listen man, give me a call at my

1561
01:40:34,356 --> 01:40:36,776
father's house, all right?

1562
01:40:36,776 --> 01:40:40,084
I'm serious man, I'm in deep shit.

Oh hi Liza, Sam told me about you.

1574
01:42:07,860 --> 01:42:10,681
So, you want to talk to him?

1575

Sam, Liza's on the phone for you.

1576
01:42:14,101 --> 01:42:16,930
It's not possible!

[Anna] Sam?

1578
01:42:26,063 --> 01:42:28,203
He's in the bathroom, he won't come

1579
01:42:28,203 --> 01:42:30,955
out, can he call you back?

him, he's locked himself in the bathroom,

1585
01:42:47,607 --> 01:42:49,987
he's not coming out, I don't know,

1586
01:42:49,987 --> 01:42:54,682

maybe you can come by.
