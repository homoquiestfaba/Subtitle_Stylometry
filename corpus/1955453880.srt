1
00:00:28,629 --> 00:00:29,762
- I'm starting a new life.

2
00:00:34,134 --> 00:00:37,536
Up here where it's quiet and
clean among the redwoods.

3
00:00:38,805 --> 00:00:40,806
And almost no one knows me.

4
00:01:18,344 --> 00:01:19,745
Poor Jerry.

5
00:01:22,348 --> 00:01:25,717
I had a nervous breakdown
after he left me.

6
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:31,557
They say I'm cured now.

7
00:01:34,394 --> 00:01:37,463
But I still have
intrusive thoughts.

8
00:01:44,471 --> 00:01:48,607
My therapist told me that
I'm not unusual at all.

9
00:01:49,676 --> 00:01:52,544
People are abused
all over the world

10
00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:54,446
every day

11
00:01:54,814 --> 00:01:56,582
much worse than me

12
00:01:58,384 --> 00:01:59,852
and they do fine.

13
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:47,599
- Your tail light's out, miss.

14
00:02:47,601 --> 00:02:50,936
- Oh, thank you for
letting me know.

15
00:02:52,705 --> 00:02:55,407
Are you gonna write me a ticket?

16
00:02:55,409 --> 00:02:59,444
- I'll let ya go this time,
but make sure you get it fixed.

17
00:03:00,813 --> 00:03:02,581
- Thank you, officer.

18
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:05,651
- You drive safely.

19
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:33,245
- When Jerry left
me, I devoured everything

20
00:03:33,247 --> 00:03:36,582
I could about how to
get your man back.

21
00:03:37,283 --> 00:03:40,452
According to the experts,
men are very fragile.

22
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:48,527
They can get crushed down if
you assert yourself in any way.

23
00:03:50,496 --> 00:03:52,798
You have to be very tricky.

24
00:04:38,544 --> 00:04:39,544
- Elaine?

25
00:04:39,812 --> 00:04:40,612
Hi, I'm Trish.

26
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:42,714
- Hi, Trish, it's
nice to meet you.

27
00:04:42,716 --> 00:04:44,549
- Oh, you're so pretty.

28
00:04:45,551 --> 00:04:46,518
Oh, um, I didn't mean anything.

29
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,320
I'm married and everything.

30
00:04:48,322 --> 00:04:50,589
- No, I didn't think anything.

31
00:04:50,591 --> 00:04:53,892
- Well, let me help
you with your bags.

32
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,427
Is this all you've got?

33
00:04:55,429 --> 00:04:56,528
- For now.

34
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:58,597
My art supplies are
being shipped over later.

35
00:04:58,599 --> 00:04:59,831
- So you're an artist?

36
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:00,932
- Yes, I am.

37
00:05:01,734 --> 00:05:03,001
- I'm an interior decorator.

38
00:05:03,003 --> 00:05:04,369
- Oh, really?

39
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:05,570
- Yes.

40
00:05:12,945 --> 00:05:14,780
That's how I met Barbara.

41
00:05:14,782 --> 00:05:17,082
I decorated this apartment.

42
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:19,518
It was lucky I
still had the keys.

43
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:23,455
Barbara didn't exactly
know when she'd be back.

44
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:37,536
How do you know Barbara?

45
00:05:37,538 --> 00:05:39,604
- We used to dance
together in San Francisco.

46
00:05:39,606 --> 00:05:40,739
- Oh, really?

47
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,082
Well, I hope you
like the apartment.

48
00:05:50,084 --> 00:05:53,051
It's a bit garish but
Barbara wanted it that way.

49
00:05:53,053 --> 00:05:56,088
She had me take all of the
colors from the Thoth tarot deck

50
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:58,390
and she and her students did
a bunch of occult paintings

51
00:05:58,392 --> 00:05:59,725
for me to hang.

52
00:06:00,593 --> 00:06:02,761
She's into all that Wicca stuff.

53
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:09,634
Well, this is it.

54
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:15,841
- Oh, Trish, I love it.

55
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:17,809
It's just beautiful.

56
00:06:17,811 --> 00:06:18,811
- Really?

57
00:06:19,445 --> 00:06:20,512
Oh, I'm so glad.

58
00:06:21,614 --> 00:06:22,881
I thought I may
have overdone it.

59
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:25,517
- Oh no, it's exactly my taste.

60
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:27,486
- You must be exhausted.

61
00:06:27,488 --> 00:06:27,486
I'm sure you want to lie down.

62
00:06:27,488 --> 00:06:31,390
- Actually, I was thinking
about getting a bite to eat.

63
00:06:31,392 --> 00:06:33,492
Do you know of a
place around here?

64
00:06:33,494 --> 00:06:34,893
- There's the
Victorian tea room.

65
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:37,496
We could go together, if
you don't mind the company.

66
00:06:37,498 --> 00:06:39,431
- Oh, how fantastic.

67
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:41,400
Where can I freshen up?

68
00:06:41,402 --> 00:06:42,968
- The bedroom is through there.

69
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:45,036
- I'll only be a moment.

70
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:19,971
- What a lovely room.

71
00:07:20,506 --> 00:07:21,673
- Yes, isn't it?

72
00:07:21,675 --> 00:07:23,442
I love Victoriana.

73
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,578
- Being here is like being
a Princess in a fairy tale.

74
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:29,481
- Do you have fairy
Princess fantasies, Elaine?

75
00:07:29,483 --> 00:07:30,549
- Of course.

76
00:07:30,551 --> 00:07:30,549
We may be grown
women, but underneath

77
00:07:30,551 --> 00:07:36,621
we're just little girls
dreaming about being carried off

78
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:39,124
by a prince on a white horse.

79
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:41,560
- Yes, I suppose so.

80
00:07:41,562 --> 00:07:43,595
It's ridiculous, isn't it?

81
00:07:49,735 --> 00:07:53,238
- I don't think I've found
my prince charming yet,

82
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,574
but I think I found the formula.

83
00:07:55,576 --> 00:07:57,042
You know, I've been
studying parapsychology

84
00:07:57,044 --> 00:08:01,480
and I understand men so
much better than I used to.

85
00:08:03,549 --> 00:08:07,786
If only I would have known
before what I know now.

86
00:08:10,022 --> 00:08:12,891
Then Jerry would
have never left me.

87
00:08:12,893 --> 00:08:14,125
- Who's Jerry?

88
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:15,894
- My ex-husband.

89
00:08:17,597 --> 00:08:21,032
The day he left me was
the day that I died.

90
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:26,204
But then I was
reborn as a witch.

91
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:31,009
Barbara and Dan brought
me back to life.

92
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:35,247
They taught me everything I
know about magic and about men.

93
00:08:36,282 --> 00:08:38,583
Men are like children.

94
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:40,986
They're very easy to please

95
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:44,523
as long as we give
them what they want.

96
00:09:23,037 --> 00:09:23,996
- Where were we?

97
00:09:23,997 --> 00:09:29,334
Oh, men, you said we need
to give them what they want.

98
00:09:29,969 --> 00:09:31,349
Well, what do men want?

99
00:09:32,638 --> 00:09:35,774
- Just a pretty woman to
love and to take care of them

100
00:09:35,776 --> 00:09:38,310
and to make them feel like a man

101
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:40,245
and to give them total freedom

102
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:42,647
in whatever they wanna do or be.

103
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:45,116
- But what about what we want?

104
00:09:45,118 --> 00:09:46,751
How are we going to
be equals with men

105
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:50,322
if we keep catering
to all of their needs?

106
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:54,693
- I think that if you want
love, you have to give love.

107
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:58,897
Giving men sex is a way of
unlocking their love potential.

108
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:03,268
- You sound as if you'd been
brainwashed by the patriarchy.

109
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:07,706
Your whole self-worth is
wrapped up in pleasing a man.

110
00:10:08,808 --> 00:10:10,875
I'll admit, I used
sex to get this,

111
00:10:12,244 --> 00:10:14,312
but I'm not proud of it.

112
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:17,616
A whole world doesn't
revolve around a man's needs.

113
00:10:17,618 --> 00:10:19,684
If I gave Richard sex
every time he wanted it,

114
00:10:19,686 --> 00:10:21,019
I'd be a wreck.

115
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:22,387
- Poor Richard.

116
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:27,659
He loves you and he wants
you and you torture him.

117
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:32,030
You have to give
a man his fantasy.

118
00:10:32,032 --> 00:10:34,899
- His fantasy?

119
00:10:34,901 --> 00:10:36,334
- Yes, his fantasy.

120
00:10:38,938 --> 00:10:41,740
But what I'm really
interested in

121
00:10:42,174 --> 00:10:43,775
is love.

122
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:48,146
You might say I'm
addicted to love.

123
00:10:49,248 --> 00:10:52,283
I wonder if all
women feel that way?

124
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:55,854
- Well, it depends on
what you mean by love.

125
00:10:55,856 --> 00:10:57,756
A husband isn't
a prince, Elaine,

126
00:10:57,758 --> 00:11:00,158
and life isn't a fairy tale.

127
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:02,160
We have to face that fact.

128
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:03,162
- Why?

129
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:05,063
Maybe life could be a fairy tale

130
00:11:05,065 --> 00:11:07,165
if you pleased
your husband more.

131
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:09,901
- I don't
need to please Richard.

132
00:11:09,903 --> 00:11:12,037
Richard loves me for myself.

133
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:13,104
- Of course.

134
00:11:13,106 --> 00:11:16,274
Maybe you did find
your prince charming.

135
00:11:16,276 --> 00:11:17,676
- Perhaps I did.

136
00:11:30,823 --> 00:11:31,823
- Guess who.

137
00:11:32,925 --> 00:11:35,293
- Richard, what
are you doing here?

138
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:38,063
This tea room is
for ladies only.

139
00:11:38,065 --> 00:11:40,231
- Oh, I went to
visit you at work

140
00:11:40,233 --> 00:11:40,231
and Julie said you were here.

141
00:11:40,233 --> 00:11:44,069
I thought we could
have lunch together.

142
00:11:44,071 --> 00:11:47,305
- Well, that's very sweet,
but I've already had my lunch.

143
00:11:47,307 --> 00:11:49,174
Oh, uh, Richard, this is Elaine.

144
00:11:49,176 --> 00:11:52,243
Elaine, this is my
husband, Richard.

145
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:54,979
- I've heard so much
about you, Richard.

146
00:11:54,981 --> 00:11:57,415
- Nothing too horrible, I hope.

147
00:11:57,417 --> 00:11:58,950
- On the contrary.

148
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:19,324
- Goddess, please,

149
00:14:21,393 --> 00:14:25,864
send me a beautiful, sweet man

150
00:14:25,866 --> 00:14:33,438
to love me as I love him.

151
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,373
To love me, love me,

152
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:41,446
love me,

153
00:14:43,315 --> 00:14:44,315
love me,

154
00:14:45,985 --> 00:14:47,051
love me,

155
00:14:48,153 --> 00:14:49,220
love me,

156
00:14:50,322 --> 00:14:51,389
love me,

157
00:14:52,626 --> 00:14:53,892
love me.

158
00:15:14,146 --> 00:15:15,513
Hi, are you Wendy?

159
00:15:16,315 --> 00:15:18,416
- Yes, what can I do for you?

160
00:15:19,151 --> 00:15:20,218
- I'm Elaine.

161
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:20,418
We spoke on the phone.

162
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:24,322
I make natural soaps
and candles and things.

163
00:15:24,324 --> 00:15:25,924
- Elaine, right.

164
00:15:26,392 --> 00:15:27,558
Thanks for coming by.

165
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:29,394
Mind if I have a look?

166
00:15:29,396 --> 00:15:30,461
- Please do.

167
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,404
- These are nice.

168
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:44,342
Really nice.

169
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:49,047
I think these will
do well in the store.

170
00:15:49,049 --> 00:15:50,481
- Then you'll take them?

171
00:15:50,483 --> 00:15:54,485
- Let's start with these
and see how they do.

172
00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:00,725
If these sell in the next
week or two, I'll order more.

173
00:16:00,727 --> 00:16:01,727
Sound good?

174
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:03,394
- Yes, fantastic.

175
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:05,396
Thank you, Wendy.

176
00:16:05,731 --> 00:16:06,731
- Sure, Elaine.

177
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:08,333
Bright blessings.

178
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:50,608
- People always
ask me why I'm a witch.

179
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:54,712
I tell them it's because I
wanna have magical powers.

180
00:16:54,714 --> 00:16:57,015
But it's not like it sounds.

181
00:16:57,017 --> 00:17:01,285
All it is is using your
will to get what you want.

182
00:17:36,655 --> 00:17:37,655
- Hi.

183
00:17:38,657 --> 00:17:39,657
- Hi.

184
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,362
- It's a beautiful day.

185
00:17:44,364 --> 00:17:45,530
- Yes, it is.

186
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:49,400
I love to be out in
nature on days like this.

187
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:51,302
- Oh, you like nature?

188
00:17:51,637 --> 00:17:52,637
- Very much.

189
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:56,374
You seem like a nature type too.

190
00:17:57,443 --> 00:18:00,244
I'll bet you like to
spend time in the woods.

191
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:01,579
- That's right.

192
00:18:02,114 --> 00:18:03,114
How'd you know?

193
00:18:03,348 --> 00:18:04,582
- I can just tell.

194
00:18:05,384 --> 00:18:07,151
Nature is where your heart is.

195
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:11,255
City and people can get
to be too much for you.

196
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:15,560
- Whuh, that is a lot to get
from someone in a few seconds.

197
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:19,330
- I'm talented that way.

198
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:23,267
- Well, you're right
about the city.

199
00:18:24,336 --> 00:18:26,137
In fact, I have a
house out in the woods

200
00:18:26,139 --> 00:18:28,206
about an hour from here.

201
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:31,442
I like to go there whenever
I can to, you know,

202
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:33,377
just think and read.

203
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:36,881
- Do you take your
wife up there?

204
00:18:36,883 --> 00:18:39,684
- No.

205
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:41,552
I'm not married.

206
00:18:42,821 --> 00:18:44,388
- Well, you might at
least take a girl up there

207
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:45,590
once in a while.

208
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,493
- I do.

209
00:18:48,495 --> 00:18:50,394
I do, once in a while.

210
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:53,331
- You wanna take a
girl up there now?

211
00:18:57,402 --> 00:18:58,903
What do you mean?

212
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:02,473
- Well, I'm new in town

213
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:05,910
and I haven't seen much
of the nature around here.

214
00:19:05,912 --> 00:19:08,513
I'll make you a nice dinner.

215
00:19:09,414 --> 00:19:13,184
- Yes, yes, okay, sure.

216
00:19:13,752 --> 00:19:15,853
Uh, my car is right over there.

217
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:17,822
- Okay.

218
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:20,291
Let's go.

219
00:20:09,241 --> 00:20:11,475
You know what I'd
like to do right now?

220
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:19,383
I'd like to make love
right here in the car

221
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:21,586
just like we were kids.

222
00:20:23,755 --> 00:20:25,656
- Wait, wait.

223
00:20:29,861 --> 00:20:31,295
You want some?

224
00:20:32,965 --> 00:20:34,298
- What is it?

225
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,601
- Something I made.

226
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:44,642
- Mm.

227
00:20:45,644 --> 00:20:49,013
Oh, wo, ho, ho, ho,
that is, that is strong.

228
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:51,482
- Finish it.

229
00:21:02,361 --> 00:21:04,729
- Oh.

230
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:11,936
- No, Wayne, Wayne, stop.

231
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:14,772
Not here.

232
00:21:15,474 --> 00:21:16,674
Let's go inside.

233
00:21:29,554 --> 00:21:30,921
This is beautiful.

234
00:21:36,028 --> 00:21:37,928
I'll start the dinner.

235
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:21,539
- Wow.

236
00:22:28,447 --> 00:22:30,448
This looks delicious.

237
00:22:33,385 --> 00:22:34,452
- To nature.

238
00:22:53,405 --> 00:22:55,940
- This is really nice, isn't it?

239
00:22:56,775 --> 00:22:58,409
I like to come up here a lot

240
00:22:58,411 --> 00:23:01,078
at the end of the
semester to unwind.

241
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,580
- Are you a teacher?

242
00:23:02,582 --> 00:23:05,116
- Yeah, I teach
at the university.

243
00:23:05,118 --> 00:23:07,385
- Oh, what do you teach?

244
00:23:07,986 --> 00:23:09,787
- English and French literature

245
00:23:09,789 --> 00:23:12,623
with a focus on
the 18th century.

246
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:15,693
- So, you must be
quite a libertine.

247
00:23:15,695 --> 00:23:16,927
- A libertine?

248
00:23:18,029 --> 00:23:19,697
Why would you say that?

249
00:23:19,699 --> 00:23:20,998
- Oh, you know.

250
00:23:22,467 --> 00:23:24,602
All of the dangerous
liaisons, Benny hill stuff.

251
00:23:24,604 --> 00:23:26,070
Not to mention Casanova.

252
00:23:26,072 --> 00:23:29,607
- Well, there
were a lot of books written

253
00:23:29,609 --> 00:23:31,442
in the 18th century.

254
00:23:31,444 --> 00:23:32,910
- Well, is it true?

255
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:35,012
Are you a libertine?

256
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:37,415
- Yes I am.

257
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:39,583
I love women.

258
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:41,819
Does that bother you?

259
00:23:41,821 --> 00:23:43,587
- On the contrary.

260
00:23:48,193 --> 00:23:49,193
Oh, hmm,

261
00:23:51,463 --> 00:23:53,564
I feel strange, dizzy.

262
00:23:59,037 --> 00:24:01,806
What was in that
drink you gave me?

263
00:24:01,808 --> 00:24:05,810
- Organic berries, vodka,
hallucinogenic herbs.

264
00:24:07,212 --> 00:24:09,213
- Hallucinogenic herbs?

265
00:24:11,484 --> 00:24:12,583
Oh, baby.

266
00:24:13,051 --> 00:24:14,652
You are really wild.

267
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:24,161
- Would you mind if I made
myself more comfortable?

268
00:24:24,163 --> 00:24:25,529
- Not at all.

269
00:24:50,121 --> 00:24:51,522
- What the hell?

270
00:24:52,858 --> 00:24:53,858
Your coat.

271
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:55,860
It's so bright.

272
00:25:00,532 --> 00:25:02,867
- I always line my clothing.

273
00:25:03,535 --> 00:25:05,536
- You have two selves.

274
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:09,974
Dark and quiet that
you show the world.

275
00:25:11,109 --> 00:25:13,177
Who do you give that to?

276
00:25:14,579 --> 00:25:15,646
The rainbow?

277
00:25:16,248 --> 00:25:18,816
- I give the rainbow to you.

278
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:21,519
Right now.

279
00:25:46,111 --> 00:25:48,913
- Oh.

280
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:53,884
- Oh.

281
00:26:03,595 --> 00:26:04,695
- Huh!

282
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:06,230
Oh god.

283
00:26:07,132 --> 00:26:08,132
Oh, Elaine.

284
00:26:10,201 --> 00:26:11,268
Look at you.

285
00:26:12,704 --> 00:26:14,305
- You can make love to me now.

286
00:27:25,911 --> 00:27:27,378
- Aw, okay.

287
00:28:48,294 --> 00:28:50,027
- What is it, Wayne?

288
00:28:50,495 --> 00:28:52,062
What is it, baby?

289
00:28:53,498 --> 00:28:56,433
- Oh, Elaine, I feel so strange.

290
00:28:58,937 --> 00:29:02,272
- It's all right,
you're with me, shhh.

291
00:29:06,044 --> 00:29:07,044
- Elaine.

292
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:13,450
No woman has ever given
herself like that to me before.

293
00:29:14,452 --> 00:29:16,520
- Life has been tough, huh?

294
00:29:17,188 --> 00:29:18,255
- Yeah, in a way.

295
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:26,363
You're not like any
other woman I've met.

296
00:29:27,232 --> 00:29:28,332
No games, no agendas.

297
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:33,504
You just seem to
take life as it is.

298
00:29:35,373 --> 00:29:38,108
- Is there any other
way to take life?

299
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:40,944
- Well, the women
I've been with,

300
00:29:42,313 --> 00:29:44,248
they all want you to make
a bunch of promises to 'em

301
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:46,817
as soon as you sleep with 'em.

302
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:50,821
But, how can you commit to someone
that you don't even know?

303
00:29:50,823 --> 00:29:51,823
It's crazy.

304
00:29:52,357 --> 00:29:53,891
- I know, baby.

305
00:29:55,059 --> 00:29:56,059
I know.

306
00:29:57,562 --> 00:30:01,999
- I never thought I wanted
to be tied down to anybody.

307
00:30:03,368 --> 00:30:06,537
But it's just 'cause no
one was ever quite right.

308
00:30:07,438 --> 00:30:10,908
All the women that I'm
attracted to physically

309
00:30:11,509 --> 00:30:13,477
they're never bright enough.

310
00:30:14,879 --> 00:30:17,981
And all the bright ones are
homely and don't arouse me.

311
00:30:19,083 --> 00:30:20,984
- That seems like
quite a problem.

312
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:24,388
- It is.

313
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:27,991
I feel my whole life as a loner,

314
00:30:28,593 --> 00:30:30,961
thinkin' I didn't need anybody.

315
00:30:32,864 --> 00:30:34,932
But now I'm not so sure.

316
00:30:35,567 --> 00:30:36,567
Oh, Elaine,

317
00:30:38,303 --> 00:30:42,339
I have never felt real
love like this before.

318
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:46,944
- You're just having a
lot of emotions right now.

319
00:30:47,312 --> 00:30:49,546
- Oh.

320
00:30:50,448 --> 00:30:51,615
Elaine, I'm scared.

321
00:30:54,619 --> 00:30:58,455
I'm not used to feeling
things so strongly.

322
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:01,024
I can't take it,
I can't take it.

323
00:31:01,026 --> 00:31:03,427
Oh.

324
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:09,433
Elaine, I'm sick.

325
00:31:10,101 --> 00:31:11,101
I'm sick.

326
00:31:12,503 --> 00:31:14,404
- Hey, it's all right.

327
00:31:17,141 --> 00:31:18,308
I've got you.

328
00:31:18,943 --> 00:31:19,943
I love you.

329
00:31:20,479 --> 00:31:24,281
And I'll always be here for you.

330
00:31:26,317 --> 00:31:28,218
Try to get some sleep.

331
00:31:37,428 --> 00:31:39,463
- Elaine.

332
00:31:43,001 --> 00:31:44,902
Elaine, where are you?

333
00:31:46,304 --> 00:31:48,372
Elaine, where are you?

334
00:31:53,044 --> 00:31:54,444
- What a pussy.

335
00:31:55,481 --> 00:31:56,546
What a baby.

336
00:31:57,382 --> 00:31:58,649
I thought I'd found a real man,

337
00:31:58,651 --> 00:32:00,651
but he's just like
a little girl.

338
00:32:00,653 --> 00:32:02,419
- Elaine!

339
00:32:03,521 --> 00:32:04,621
- No one was ever there for me

340
00:32:04,623 --> 00:32:07,057
when I was crying my heart out.

341
00:32:08,394 --> 00:32:10,527
No one ever comforted me.

342
00:32:11,296 --> 00:32:12,296
No one.

343
00:33:26,404 --> 00:33:28,305
- Good morning, Wayne.

344
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:30,273
- Hi, Elaine.

345
00:33:36,581 --> 00:33:38,415
- Here, drink this.

346
00:33:48,793 --> 00:33:52,396
- I had such horrible
dreams last night.

347
00:33:53,431 --> 00:33:55,399
- What did you
dream about, baby.

348
00:33:56,501 --> 00:33:58,035
- I dreamt that I
was calling your name

349
00:33:58,037 --> 00:33:59,736
and you didn't answer.

350
00:34:01,339 --> 00:34:04,174
I kept calling and calling,
but I couldn't find you.

351
00:34:07,245 --> 00:34:10,247
Oh, Elaine, you
love me, don't you?

352
00:34:12,517 --> 00:34:13,583
- Of course, I love you.

353
00:34:13,585 --> 00:34:17,821
- Oh god, oh god, Elaine.

354
00:34:23,428 --> 00:34:24,694
- Are you hungry?

355
00:34:26,631 --> 00:34:28,765
- I don't know what I am.

356
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:31,601
- Well, try to get some sleep.

357
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:33,737
- Elaine.

358
00:34:35,606 --> 00:34:37,107
Don't leave me.

359
00:34:37,708 --> 00:34:39,476
- I'm not going anywhere, baby.

360
00:34:39,478 --> 00:34:41,111
I'll be right here.

361
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:09,573
Wayne, wake up.

362
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:11,108
It's late.

363
00:35:13,511 --> 00:35:14,511
Wayne.

364
00:35:15,346 --> 00:35:17,347
Wayne, baby, wake up.

365
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:19,783
Wake up.

366
00:35:21,219 --> 00:35:22,219
Wayne.

367
00:36:37,728 --> 00:36:40,497
Tampons aren't gross.

368
00:36:40,499 --> 00:36:43,800
Women bleed and that's
a beautiful thing.

369
00:36:45,403 --> 00:36:49,206
Do you know that most men have
ever even seen a used tampon?

370
00:36:55,513 --> 00:36:58,348
Part of me can be
with Wayne now.

371
00:36:59,784 --> 00:37:00,784
Always.

372
00:37:03,621 --> 00:37:05,855
I don't really mind death.

373
00:37:06,657 --> 00:37:08,325
I've buried people before.

374
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:11,261
People I really cared about.

375
00:37:16,434 --> 00:37:19,936
In the end we're all
just compost anyway.

376
00:37:21,439 --> 00:37:23,440
Everything regenerates.

377
00:37:26,844 --> 00:37:29,512
I'd like to come back as a cat.

378
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:33,917
I've been so depressed
since my cat died.

379
00:37:35,453 --> 00:37:38,488
His name was Greymalkin,
but he was black and white.

380
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:41,591
He was my best friend.

381
00:38:00,478 --> 00:38:02,846
- I give the rainbow to you.

382
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:06,750
Right now.

383
00:39:47,485 --> 00:39:48,518
Just a minute.

384
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,427
Oh hi Trish.

385
00:39:57,762 --> 00:39:58,762
Come on in.

386
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:00,397
- Hey, Elaine.

387
00:40:00,765 --> 00:40:01,998
You look gorgeous.

388
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,533
I love what you've
done with your hair.

389
00:40:03,535 --> 00:40:04,601
- Thank you.

390
00:40:05,436 --> 00:40:05,435
What's up, honey?

391
00:40:05,437 --> 00:40:07,771
- Well, I haven't been
able to reach you,

392
00:40:07,773 --> 00:40:08,938
so I thought I'd come over

393
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:10,940
to see if everything
was all right.

394
00:40:10,942 --> 00:40:11,942
- I'm fine.

395
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:13,510
Really.

396
00:40:14,712 --> 00:40:16,513
Can I offer you something?

397
00:40:16,515 --> 00:40:19,082
I just made some tea and cake.

398
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:21,017
- Just tea, thank you.

399
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:35,098
- Cream and sugar?

400
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:37,534
- No, I'm fine, thank you.

401
00:40:53,083 --> 00:40:55,919
So, what have you
been so busy with?

402
00:40:55,921 --> 00:40:57,153
A man, I hope.

403
00:40:57,855 --> 00:40:59,155
- Yes, it was a man.

404
00:41:00,524 --> 00:41:02,559
But, it didn't work out.

405
00:41:03,093 --> 00:41:03,960
- I'm sorry.

406
00:41:03,962 --> 00:41:07,697
- Yes, it's a shame
and I really liked him.

407
00:41:10,234 --> 00:41:12,168
I thought that he was the one.

408
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:14,237
- Well, maybe next time.

409
00:41:15,706 --> 00:41:18,208
- Are you sure you
won't have some cake?

410
00:41:18,210 --> 00:41:19,943
- Oh, no, thank you.

411
00:41:21,545 --> 00:41:24,614
I just came over to check up
on you and to say good bye.

412
00:41:24,616 --> 00:41:25,616
- Good bye?

413
00:41:26,951 --> 00:41:28,651
Why, where are you going?

414
00:41:28,653 --> 00:41:32,722
- Oh, just to Dallas for
a furniture convention.

415
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:35,225
- Is Richard going with you?

416
00:41:35,227 --> 00:41:36,926
- No, it's just a business trip.

417
00:41:36,928 --> 00:41:41,097
Richard will have to fend
for himself for awhile.

418
00:42:15,633 --> 00:42:18,101
- Sam, give me two
whiskeys on the rocks.

419
00:42:18,103 --> 00:42:19,736
- Sure thing, Jane.

420
00:42:21,272 --> 00:42:22,972
You see the papers today?

421
00:42:22,974 --> 00:42:23,974
- No, why?

422
00:42:24,975 --> 00:42:27,010
- They found a body
in the eel river.

423
00:42:27,012 --> 00:42:28,012
- A murder?

424
00:42:28,646 --> 00:42:29,646
- Maybe.

425
00:42:30,215 --> 00:42:34,050
They found a symbol
carved in his chest.

426
00:42:35,319 --> 00:42:36,619
Here.

427
00:42:38,322 --> 00:42:41,558
- It's a pentagram.

428
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:43,793
- It's them witches again.

429
00:42:44,929 --> 00:42:47,630
- That's what I was
thinking too, Lyle.

430
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:52,602
- So yeah, Barbara,
that's everything.

431
00:42:53,971 --> 00:42:56,306
After Jerry died, the cops
wouldn't stop harassing me.

432
00:42:56,308 --> 00:42:58,675
They couldn't prove anything.

433
00:42:58,677 --> 00:43:01,611
They actually thought
that I killed him.

434
00:43:01,613 --> 00:43:03,279
Can you believe it?

435
00:43:04,648 --> 00:43:08,618
Anyways, San Francisco got
to be a really bad trip

436
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:09,719
after you left.

437
00:43:11,188 --> 00:43:13,990
That's when I remembered you
had that extra apartment.

438
00:43:13,992 --> 00:43:15,992
- Well, it was perfect timing.

439
00:43:15,994 --> 00:43:18,361
I'm just sorry I wasn't
here to greet you.

440
00:43:18,363 --> 00:43:19,596
That's all right.

441
00:43:19,598 --> 00:43:21,698
Trish has been lovely.

442
00:43:22,633 --> 00:43:24,267
And I've been getting
a lot of artwork done.

443
00:43:24,269 --> 00:43:26,803
But I had this
experience last weekend

444
00:43:26,805 --> 00:43:28,871
that really shook me up.

445
00:43:30,841 --> 00:43:32,675
- Why, what happened?

446
00:43:33,811 --> 00:43:35,745
- Well, I met this
great-looking guy.

447
00:43:35,747 --> 00:43:38,114
And I used love magic on him.

448
00:43:38,116 --> 00:43:40,750
Then he got really weird on me.

449
00:43:42,052 --> 00:43:45,355
All these emotions started
flowing out of him.

450
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:48,858
Then he got really

451
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:51,127
sick.

452
00:43:52,396 --> 00:43:54,397
- Well, guys can't handle
their emotions too well.

453
00:43:54,399 --> 00:43:57,266
That's why they don't
like heavy conversations.

454
00:43:57,268 --> 00:43:59,302
It was probably just
too much for him.

455
00:43:59,304 --> 00:44:03,406
All the love and the great
sex that you were giving him.

456
00:44:03,408 --> 00:44:05,908
- I guess that's what it was.

457
00:44:06,377 --> 00:44:08,011
But, I don't know.

458
00:44:09,113 --> 00:44:11,214
- Honey, you have
to be more careful.

459
00:44:11,216 --> 00:44:12,715
Maybe you shouldn't be
messing with love spells

460
00:44:12,717 --> 00:44:15,184
in the first place, you know.

461
00:44:17,254 --> 00:44:19,055
- Merry meet, Elaine.

462
00:44:20,024 --> 00:44:22,191
- Bright blessings Gahan.

463
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:43,880
- I heard you
discussing love spells.

464
00:44:43,882 --> 00:44:45,815
You do have to be
careful, Elaine.

465
00:44:45,817 --> 00:44:49,686
Love spells never work the
way you think they will.

466
00:44:49,688 --> 00:44:53,189
But on a lighter note, it's
wonderful to see you, Elaine.

467
00:44:53,191 --> 00:44:55,725
What's it been now, a year?

468
00:44:56,427 --> 00:44:59,362
We must celebrate this
reunion of dear friends.

469
00:44:59,364 --> 00:45:01,764
Thank you goddess everywhere

470
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:06,302
for the blessings that we share.

471
00:45:06,304 --> 00:45:08,438
- Blessed be, Variah.

472
00:45:10,974 --> 00:45:12,442
- Go home, witches.

473
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:15,111
Go home.

474
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:17,480
- Just ignore them.

475
00:45:17,482 --> 00:45:19,282
They're always
giving us trouble.

476
00:45:19,284 --> 00:45:22,018
- I didn't know this town
was hostile to witches.

477
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:24,320
- Well, it's certainly
not San Francisco.

478
00:45:24,322 --> 00:45:26,789
But it's not bad
for a small town.

479
00:45:26,791 --> 00:45:28,391
Not all of them
embrace our methods

480
00:45:28,393 --> 00:45:30,460
of practicing witchcraft.

481
00:45:30,462 --> 00:45:34,297
But, I don't see why we
ought to be so uptight now.

482
00:45:34,299 --> 00:45:37,500
Back in the day, we
all made love freely

483
00:45:39,036 --> 00:45:41,838
and put up Baphomet posters
and no one was dogmatic

484
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:45,408
about whether they were a witch
or a satanist or thelemites,

485
00:45:45,410 --> 00:45:48,411
or a druid or a
wiccan or whatever.

486
00:45:49,246 --> 00:45:50,379
And it was fun.

487
00:45:51,116 --> 00:45:54,484
But our classes and circles
have been very popular.

488
00:46:00,758 --> 00:46:02,258
- What have you been teaching?

489
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:04,961
- Let's see, I've got a
new class on Sidral magic

490
00:46:04,963 --> 00:46:08,297
and Barbara's got a new
class on organite alchemy.

491
00:46:08,299 --> 00:46:10,867
Otherwise, we're still
teaching the staples,

492
00:46:10,869 --> 00:46:13,469
energy grounding,
earth-based spirituality,

493
00:46:13,471 --> 00:46:15,304
pagan arts and crafts,

494
00:46:15,306 --> 00:46:19,542
candle work, the spellcraft
master class, ancient mysticism,

495
00:46:20,878 --> 00:46:23,479
herbs and spices, and
sex magic, of course.

496
00:46:24,481 --> 00:46:27,116
- Oh, are you still
teaching that?

497
00:46:28,418 --> 00:46:31,254
- Yes, in fact, we've invited
some girls here tonight

498
00:46:31,256 --> 00:46:35,324
for a seminar about the
power of sexual dancing.

499
00:46:36,527 --> 00:46:40,163
Dancing is such a powerful
thing for women and girls.

500
00:46:40,831 --> 00:46:42,431
- Are you still dancing?

501
00:46:42,433 --> 00:46:44,367
- Yeah, some of us dance
here on amateur night.

502
00:46:44,369 --> 00:46:45,568
You should come.

503
00:46:48,172 --> 00:46:49,205
- Hi, Barbara.

504
00:46:49,207 --> 00:46:50,207
Hi, Gahan.

505
00:46:50,574 --> 00:46:51,841
Sorry we're late.

506
00:46:51,843 --> 00:46:55,978
- Hello lovely ladies,
please have a seat.

507
00:46:57,447 --> 00:47:01,150
Elaine, this is star
and her sister moon.

508
00:47:02,152 --> 00:47:03,386
They're our students
for tonight.

509
00:47:03,388 --> 00:47:05,521
Girls, this is our
dear friend Elaine.

510
00:47:05,523 --> 00:47:06,523
- Hi.

511
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:08,157
- Hi.

512
00:47:09,126 --> 00:47:10,493
- I was just pointing
out that dancing

513
00:47:10,495 --> 00:47:13,396
is a powerful thing
for women and girls.

514
00:47:13,398 --> 00:47:15,164
We asked you to
meet us here tonight

515
00:47:15,166 --> 00:47:17,533
so you could learn about that.

516
00:47:19,536 --> 00:47:22,872
Do you see how
powerful that girl is?

517
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:27,009
These men would do
anything for her.

518
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:31,113
Wouldn't you like to have
that power yourselves?

519
00:47:31,615 --> 00:47:33,382
Then let us begin.

520
00:47:34,551 --> 00:47:38,020
All witches need to figure
out where their power lies.

521
00:47:38,022 --> 00:47:41,090
And we feel that a
woman's greatest power

522
00:47:41,092 --> 00:47:42,992
lies in her sexuality.

523
00:47:44,361 --> 00:47:47,930
We don't view this power as
satanic or anti-feminist,

524
00:47:49,233 --> 00:47:52,401
but as a celebration of
woman as a natural creature.

525
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:57,106
An earthly body, a spiritual
essence, and a womb.

526
00:47:59,343 --> 00:48:02,078
- The whole history of
witchcraft is interwoven

527
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:04,981
with the fear of
female sexuality.

528
00:48:06,316 --> 00:48:08,150
They burned us at the
stake because they feared

529
00:48:08,152 --> 00:48:11,454
the erotic feelings
we illicited in them.

530
00:48:11,456 --> 00:48:14,590
Later, they used marriage
to hold us in bondage

531
00:48:14,592 --> 00:48:19,028
and made us into servants,
whores, and fantasy dolls

532
00:48:19,630 --> 00:48:22,031
never asking us what we wanted.

533
00:48:23,166 --> 00:48:25,468
- They teach us that a
normative human being

534
00:48:25,470 --> 00:48:28,371
is a hyper-rationalist,
stoic male

535
00:48:29,506 --> 00:48:32,241
and that women's emotions
and intuitions are illnesses

536
00:48:32,243 --> 00:48:34,143
that need to be cured.

537
00:48:35,312 --> 00:48:38,514
And they believe that men
and women are different

538
00:48:38,516 --> 00:48:42,485
and that true equality
lies in that difference.

539
00:48:43,987 --> 00:48:45,621
- We strive for male/female
polarity and to regain

540
00:48:45,623 --> 00:48:47,390
our primal power as goddesses.

541
00:48:49,227 --> 00:48:51,494
We need to teach
men how to love us

542
00:48:51,496 --> 00:48:54,163
using ways they can understand.

543
00:48:54,965 --> 00:48:56,499
So goddesses, use perfume,

544
00:48:57,401 --> 00:48:59,535
wear high heels and makeup,

545
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:03,973
learn to dress your
hair in attractive ways,

546
00:49:03,975 --> 00:49:08,110
display flesh artfully,
and know what to conceal.

547
00:49:09,012 --> 00:49:11,080
Be a mother and a lover.

548
00:49:12,416 --> 00:49:16,352
Stand your ground, but always
let the man feel like a man.

549
00:49:19,222 --> 00:49:22,358
- Use sex magic to
destroy his fear of you

550
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:25,995
and to open his heart to
the floodgates of love.

551
00:49:25,997 --> 00:49:29,498
Only then will he begin to
see you as a human being

552
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:32,268
with all of your inner beauty.

553
00:49:33,337 --> 00:49:34,470
Then, when his heart
is open to love,

554
00:49:34,472 --> 00:49:37,573
you may do with
him what you will.

555
00:49:58,362 --> 00:50:01,364
- I love you, Elaine.

556
00:50:02,165 --> 00:50:03,566
You know that, don't you?

557
00:50:06,036 --> 00:50:07,636
I love you very much.

558
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:13,542
But you need to be more careful.

559
00:50:16,246 --> 00:50:19,482
Dinner was late three
times this week.

560
00:50:20,384 --> 00:50:22,551
And that house is
a total pigsty.

561
00:50:23,653 --> 00:50:27,023
Do you know that I
found an old hot dog

562
00:50:27,624 --> 00:50:29,225
under the bed this morning?

563
00:50:32,429 --> 00:50:34,597
And why don't you
ever brush your hair?

564
00:50:34,599 --> 00:50:39,035
You need to take better care
of yourself and of the house.

565
00:50:40,203 --> 00:50:43,172
I'm embarrassed to
have people over.

566
00:50:44,241 --> 00:50:45,574
I've been really
patient up until now,

567
00:50:45,576 --> 00:50:48,477
but you need to
step up your game.

568
00:50:51,081 --> 00:50:53,816
- I have a
crazy bitch for a daughter.

569
00:50:53,818 --> 00:50:56,652
What?

570
00:50:57,621 --> 00:50:59,321
You're not crazy.

571
00:51:00,524 --> 00:51:02,525
Well, if you're not
crazy then you're stupid.

572
00:51:02,527 --> 00:51:03,459
Which is it?

573
00:51:03,461 --> 00:51:05,694
Are you crazy or are you stupid?

574
00:51:05,696 --> 00:51:08,130
And you could lose a few pounds.

575
00:51:08,132 --> 00:51:10,499
You're looking a little fatty.

576
00:51:13,438 --> 00:51:17,673
- Oh my god, Elaine,
you've lost so much weight.

577
00:51:18,442 --> 00:51:20,509
You have such a hot body now.

578
00:51:21,411 --> 00:51:24,513
Do you like it when I
touch you like this?

579
00:51:24,515 --> 00:51:25,681
Or like this?

580
00:51:29,286 --> 00:51:30,686
I wanna make you come.

581
00:51:35,126 --> 00:51:37,359
- Don't be frightened, Elaine.

582
00:51:37,361 --> 00:51:39,328
I would never hurt you.

583
00:51:40,130 --> 00:51:41,730
I'm not the big, bad wolf.

584
00:51:42,866 --> 00:51:46,535
You need to have perfect
love and perfect trust.

585
00:52:24,708 --> 00:52:27,576
- Hast thou the courage
to make the assay?

586
00:52:27,578 --> 00:52:31,814
- I have two words, perfect
love and perfect trust.

587
00:52:50,433 --> 00:52:53,669
- Assist me to erect
the ancient altar

588
00:52:54,771 --> 00:52:57,239
at which in days
past all worshiped.

589
00:52:58,909 --> 00:53:02,478
From the old times, a
woman was the altar.

590
00:53:03,813 --> 00:53:06,882
And the sacred place was
the point within the center

591
00:53:06,884 --> 00:53:10,486
of the circle, the
origin of all things.

592
00:53:13,623 --> 00:53:16,392
Therefore, should we adore it.

593
00:53:46,723 --> 00:53:48,891
- Good morning, sergeant Griff.

594
00:53:48,893 --> 00:53:51,227
Congratulations
on your promotion.

595
00:53:51,229 --> 00:53:52,528
- Thanks, Connie.

596
00:53:53,396 --> 00:53:54,797
Is there any coffee.

597
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:56,865
- Yeah, I just made some.

598
00:53:56,867 --> 00:53:59,602
I made it just the
way you like it.

599
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:02,605
- Is there anything
you don't do well?

600
00:54:02,607 --> 00:54:06,609
- Why don't you try me
sometime and find out?

601
00:54:11,548 --> 00:54:13,549
- How's the coffee, Steve?

602
00:54:13,551 --> 00:54:14,850
- Uh, too strong.

603
00:54:17,587 --> 00:54:19,722
- Well, I like it strong.

604
00:54:20,857 --> 00:54:23,525
Man's gotta stay awake
on the job after all.

605
00:54:23,527 --> 00:54:26,929
- Why, have you been
keeping late nights?

606
00:54:26,931 --> 00:54:27,931
- Maybe so.

607
00:54:32,002 --> 00:54:33,802
- But, now that
you've been promoted,

608
00:54:33,804 --> 00:54:36,872
maybe you ought to start
thinking about settling down.

609
00:54:36,874 --> 00:54:38,641
- Me, you kidding?

610
00:54:44,748 --> 00:54:48,584
- Sergeant meadows, a
lady's here to see you.

611
00:54:49,452 --> 00:54:49,451
- I'm Shelly Curtis.

612
00:54:49,453 --> 00:54:54,490
I phoned about Wayne Peters,
the teacher who disappeared.

613
00:54:55,358 --> 00:54:56,458
- Yes, of course.

614
00:54:57,060 --> 00:54:58,827
Have a seat, miss Curtis.

615
00:55:00,864 --> 00:55:04,433
You say you think Mr. Peters
might have been kidnapped?

616
00:55:04,435 --> 00:55:07,736
- Yes, no one's seen
him for two weeks.

617
00:55:08,805 --> 00:55:11,573
I went by his house and
the mail's piled up.

618
00:55:12,642 --> 00:55:14,677
We had lunch the
day he disappeared.

619
00:55:16,046 --> 00:55:19,081
I saw him drive away with a
strange woman near the Plaza.

620
00:55:19,083 --> 00:55:22,084
- Do you have any idea where
he might have gone with her?

621
00:55:22,086 --> 00:55:23,485
- Wayne used to spend weekends

622
00:55:23,487 --> 00:55:26,588
up in a cabin he
had in the woods.

623
00:55:28,091 --> 00:55:29,958
He used to take dates there.

624
00:56:01,591 --> 00:56:04,893
- Oh, Jesus.

625
00:56:26,082 --> 00:56:27,649
- Hey Griff, look.

626
00:56:29,152 --> 00:56:30,152
- Good lord.

627
00:56:39,529 --> 00:56:40,763
- What the hell is this?

628
00:56:42,733 --> 00:56:44,066
- I don't know.

629
00:56:51,941 --> 00:56:53,575
We're going to
have to dig, Steve.

630
00:56:53,577 --> 00:56:54,577
- I know.

631
00:57:02,018 --> 00:57:03,898
I think you should go
back to the house, Shelly.

632
00:57:29,546 --> 00:57:30,546
- Mmm, mmm,

633
00:57:35,452 --> 00:57:38,153
this cake is
absolutely fantastic.

634
00:57:38,822 --> 00:57:40,088
And what a great dinner.

635
00:57:40,090 --> 00:57:41,156
- Thank you.

636
00:57:41,758 --> 00:57:43,158
I enjoy cooking.

637
00:57:44,561 --> 00:57:47,229
Hope you don't mind
my calling you.

638
00:57:47,231 --> 00:57:50,232
Sometimes it's so
hard to be alone.

639
00:57:50,767 --> 00:57:51,633
- Not at all.

640
00:57:51,635 --> 00:57:57,105
I get a little lonely, too,
when Trisha is out of town.

641
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:06,215
- How long have you
and Trish been married?

642
00:58:06,217 --> 00:58:08,650
- 10 years this September.

643
00:58:08,985 --> 00:58:10,052
- 10 years?

644
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:13,021
It's really amazing.

645
00:58:14,958 --> 00:58:19,194
No one has ever loved me the
way you love Trish, no one.

646
00:58:26,536 --> 00:58:28,570
- What about your husband?

647
00:58:29,572 --> 00:58:31,139
- My husband never loved me.

648
00:58:31,141 --> 00:58:34,276
He couldn't wait to
get away from me.

649
00:58:35,011 --> 00:58:36,078
- I'm sorry.

650
00:58:45,622 --> 00:58:49,858
Sometimes I think Trish would
like to get away from me, too.

651
00:58:50,627 --> 00:58:51,693
- Poor baby.

652
00:58:53,096 --> 00:58:54,696
Poor, poor baby.

653
00:59:24,961 --> 00:59:27,629
So, tell me, what turns you on?

654
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:33,335
- What turns me on?

655
00:59:34,604 --> 00:59:36,772
Wow, no one's ever
asked me that before.

656
00:59:36,774 --> 00:59:37,940
Let me think.

657
00:59:40,176 --> 00:59:42,978
You know what
really turns me on?

658
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:44,580
Flying.

659
00:59:44,881 --> 00:59:45,881
- Flying?

660
00:59:46,249 --> 00:59:48,150
- Yeah, flying a plane.

661
00:59:49,252 --> 00:59:51,053
You don't know what
kinda high it is.

662
00:59:51,055 --> 00:59:54,022
You're soarin' up
there above everything.

663
00:59:54,024 --> 00:59:55,591
You're in control.

664
00:59:56,259 --> 00:59:57,693
- Oh, how fantastic.

665
00:59:58,728 --> 00:59:59,728
- It really is.

666
01:00:01,264 --> 01:00:05,100
It's the only time I feel
really clear about things.

667
01:00:06,302 --> 01:00:09,671
Sometimes I look at my life
and I wonder how I got here.

668
01:00:14,043 --> 01:00:15,644
I feel like my life
is slipping away

669
01:00:15,646 --> 01:00:18,113
and there's so many
things I haven't done.

670
01:00:18,115 --> 01:00:19,181
- Like what?

671
01:00:19,183 --> 01:00:21,216
- I've never had any
sort of love affairs

672
01:00:21,218 --> 01:00:23,385
or gotten into any mischief.

673
01:00:24,921 --> 01:00:26,989
I used to watch those
old Steve McQueen movies,

674
01:00:26,991 --> 01:00:30,225
you know, the ones where
they'd rob a bank or something,

675
01:00:30,227 --> 01:00:31,893
and I'd fantasize that
I was one of those

676
01:00:31,895 --> 01:00:36,131
crazy kinda gangsters with a
sexy, messed up girl on my arm.

677
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:41,303
Or those westerns, when
they'd shoot up a town

678
01:00:42,405 --> 01:00:44,806
and then go visit the
local prostitutes.

679
01:00:44,808 --> 01:00:46,842
It's sounds stupid, I know.

680
01:00:46,844 --> 01:00:48,310
- No, it doesn't.

681
01:00:50,380 --> 01:00:51,780
It's very sweet.

682
01:00:53,716 --> 01:00:54,716
- Really?

683
01:00:56,719 --> 01:00:58,720
Trish doesn't think so.

684
01:00:59,856 --> 01:01:02,324
She just rolls her eyes
when I talk like this.

685
01:01:02,326 --> 01:01:06,261
- That's because she
doesn't understand you.

686
01:01:07,063 --> 01:01:08,797
I understand you perfectly.

687
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:11,800
- You do?

688
01:01:12,235 --> 01:01:13,235
- Of course.

689
01:01:14,804 --> 01:01:17,873
You wanna have a
sordid love affair.

690
01:01:18,941 --> 01:01:21,710
You wanna get into
some mischief.

691
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,000
- Uh.

692
01:02:35,818 --> 01:02:36,818
- Ho!

693
01:03:04,347 --> 01:03:05,380
Who are you?

694
01:03:06,249 --> 01:03:08,383
What are you doing to me?

695
01:03:09,018 --> 01:03:10,418
- I'm the love witch.

696
01:03:11,921 --> 01:03:15,323
I'm your ultimate fantasy.

697
01:03:15,325 --> 01:03:16,858
- That's right.

698
01:03:19,129 --> 01:03:20,129
That's right.

699
01:03:27,203 --> 01:03:29,404
- Steve, I'm going out
to see that witch doctor.

700
01:03:29,406 --> 01:03:30,406
- Who?

701
01:03:30,973 --> 01:03:32,207
- Professor king.

702
01:03:32,209 --> 01:03:34,442
He specializes in black
magic and witchcraft.

703
01:03:34,444 --> 01:03:35,844
He might be able to help me

704
01:03:35,846 --> 01:03:37,312
identify some of
the items we found.

705
01:03:37,314 --> 01:03:38,446
- It's great.

706
01:03:39,248 --> 01:03:40,482
Did you get the lab report?

707
01:03:40,484 --> 01:03:43,852
- Yeah, yeah, it looks
like heart failure.

708
01:03:45,221 --> 01:03:47,222
But the toxicology report
showed traces of jimsonweed

709
01:03:47,224 --> 01:03:51,459
also known as devil's weed, a
highly toxic hallucinogenic.

710
01:03:52,094 --> 01:03:53,461
- It's unbelievable.

711
01:03:54,463 --> 01:03:54,462
You want me to come with you?

712
01:03:54,464 --> 01:03:58,266
- No, this will only
take a few minutes.

713
01:03:58,268 --> 01:04:00,969
Can you order me a Turkey
and avocado on whole wheat?

714
01:04:00,971 --> 01:04:02,337
- Mustard, Mayo?

715
01:04:03,005 --> 01:04:04,406
- Yeah and Cole slaw.

716
01:04:05,107 --> 01:04:05,941
Thanks.

717
01:04:05,943 --> 01:04:06,943
- Done.

718
01:04:15,518 --> 01:04:19,087
- Ah, sergeant meadows, sorry
to have kept you waiting.

719
01:04:19,089 --> 01:04:21,456
- Glad to meet you, professor.

720
01:04:24,327 --> 01:04:27,362
Professor, this is the
bottle we found in a grave

721
01:04:27,364 --> 01:04:31,466
of Wayne Peters, the one
you read about in the paper.

722
01:04:31,468 --> 01:04:33,134
- Interesting, yes.

723
01:04:33,970 --> 01:04:36,471
Just as I thought.

724
01:04:36,473 --> 01:04:39,374
The contents indicate
that it's a witch bottle.

725
01:04:39,376 --> 01:04:40,375
- A witch bottle?

726
01:04:40,377 --> 01:04:41,543
- Yes, witches used to make them

727
01:04:41,545 --> 01:04:44,312
for protection against curses.

728
01:04:44,947 --> 01:04:47,916
They'd take something personal
like bodily fluids or hair

729
01:04:47,918 --> 01:04:49,584
along with herbs
and something sharp

730
01:04:49,586 --> 01:04:54,022
like pins or broken glass
to scare away evil spirits.

731
01:04:54,924 --> 01:04:56,157
Witch bottles have often been
found buried in the hearse

732
01:04:56,159 --> 01:04:57,492
of very old houses.

733
01:04:57,494 --> 01:05:00,462
- Would it be safe to assume
that the person who made this

734
01:05:00,464 --> 01:05:01,529
was a witch?

735
01:05:02,198 --> 01:05:03,465
- It's very likely.

736
01:05:03,467 --> 01:05:05,567
Witchcraft, long dormant
in civilized places,

737
01:05:05,569 --> 01:05:08,203
has taken root again in cities.

738
01:05:08,205 --> 01:05:10,238
There have several
rituals per year.

739
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:14,476
One of them, Samhain,
corresponds of our Halloween.

740
01:05:14,944 --> 01:05:18,280
Other rituals celebrate
summer solstice, Litha,

741
01:05:18,282 --> 01:05:22,183
or the winter solstice,
which they call Imolg.

742
01:05:25,421 --> 01:05:28,189
Here the members of a coven
kiss the devil's behind

743
01:05:28,191 --> 01:05:31,092
in a mockery of
Christian rituals.

744
01:05:32,662 --> 01:05:36,264
Here, a satanic cult
sacrifices a child.

745
01:05:37,333 --> 01:05:39,067
- Does this stuff
really go on today?

746
01:05:39,069 --> 01:05:40,302
- Yes, indeed.

747
01:05:40,304 --> 01:05:44,172
Those who practice human
sacrifice are the black witches

748
01:05:44,174 --> 01:05:47,142
who perform blood rituals
to gain demonic powers

749
01:05:47,144 --> 01:05:50,345
and to bind their members
together in secrecy.

750
01:05:50,347 --> 01:05:52,681
Law has been trying to root
out these cults for decades

751
01:05:52,683 --> 01:05:54,983
but they've been unsuccessful.

752
01:05:54,985 --> 01:05:57,152
Then there are the
white witches or Wiccans

753
01:05:57,154 --> 01:05:59,421
who commune in nature
in the healing spirit

754
01:05:59,423 --> 01:06:02,590
and who have a strict law
that forbids harming others.

755
01:06:02,592 --> 01:06:05,026
Every city and rural
village today has pockets

756
01:06:05,028 --> 01:06:06,494
of both black and white witches

757
01:06:06,496 --> 01:06:09,164
who practice the ancient rites.

758
01:06:40,062 --> 01:06:44,299
- I invoke and call upon
thee, mighty mother of us all.

759
01:06:45,701 --> 01:06:50,138
I invoke thee to descend upon
the body of this thy servant

760
01:06:51,374 --> 01:06:52,607
and priestess.

761
01:06:54,643 --> 01:06:57,312
- Of the mother
darksome and divine

762
01:06:57,314 --> 01:06:59,748
here I charge you in this sign.

763
01:07:02,485 --> 01:07:06,087
- Listen to the words
of the great mother.

764
01:07:08,291 --> 01:07:11,526
She, who of old, who
was also called Artemis,

765
01:07:11,528 --> 01:07:14,529
Aphrodite, Ceridwyn,
Diana, Isis,

766
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:19,467
and by many other names.

767
01:07:23,040 --> 01:07:25,440
- Whenever ye have
need of anything,

768
01:07:25,442 --> 01:07:29,477
then ye shall assemble in some
secret place and adore me,

769
01:07:30,346 --> 01:07:32,747
who am queen of all witches.

770
01:07:34,083 --> 01:07:37,419
There shall ye assemble,
ye who are fain to learn

771
01:07:37,421 --> 01:07:38,486
all sorcery.

772
01:07:39,822 --> 01:07:44,225
Behold all acts of love and
pleasure are my rituals.

773
01:07:45,361 --> 01:07:48,296
Behold I have been with
thee from the beginning

774
01:07:49,365 --> 01:07:52,467
and I am that which is
attained at the end of desire.

775
01:08:15,091 --> 01:08:16,091
- Arise.

776
01:08:57,700 --> 01:08:59,534
- You're looking a little
tense tonight, love.

777
01:08:59,536 --> 01:09:01,336
What's the matter?

778
01:09:02,505 --> 01:09:06,508
- Oh nothing, just my usual
roller coaster love life.

779
01:09:07,510 --> 01:09:08,843
- Well, have a drink and relax.

780
01:09:08,845 --> 01:09:12,614
Nothing's that dire,
at least not for you.

781
01:09:13,782 --> 01:09:16,818
It's an entirely different
story for your victims.

782
01:09:18,521 --> 01:09:19,654
- What victims?

783
01:09:19,656 --> 01:09:23,525
- There's no need to play
miss innocent with me, dearie.

784
01:09:23,527 --> 01:09:25,460
- Please, don't touch me.

785
01:09:31,367 --> 01:09:32,734
- Bright blessings, Barbara.

786
01:09:32,736 --> 01:09:34,335
- Merry meet, Elaine.

787
01:09:34,337 --> 01:09:35,436
How's it going?

788
01:09:36,572 --> 01:09:37,539
- I'm back in the
dating pool again.

789
01:09:37,541 --> 01:09:38,740
- What happened?

790
01:09:38,742 --> 01:09:41,709
I thought you were crazy about
that new guy you were seeing,

791
01:09:41,711 --> 01:09:43,311
the married man.

792
01:09:43,779 --> 01:09:45,380
- No, I broke it off.

793
01:09:46,448 --> 01:09:48,917
He just became really
obsessive, morose,

794
01:09:49,952 --> 01:09:52,654
and his aura became
really murky.

795
01:09:53,756 --> 01:09:56,858
He didn't even wanna
make love anymore.

796
01:09:58,427 --> 01:10:01,229
He became just like a woman,
crying at every little thing.

797
01:10:01,697 --> 01:10:03,598
There was no polarity.

798
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:05,833
But, I should have known.

799
01:10:05,835 --> 01:10:07,268
He's a Pisces.

800
01:10:38,434 --> 01:10:39,534
- Richard.

801
01:10:42,771 --> 01:10:44,872
- I thought I told you
never to interrupt me

802
01:10:44,874 --> 01:10:46,341
when I'm working.

803
01:10:46,343 --> 01:10:47,642
What do you want?

804
01:10:49,245 --> 01:10:50,712
- I just wanted to let you
know that I'm going to bed

805
01:10:50,714 --> 01:10:52,614
and I'm taking a pill.

806
01:11:11,300 --> 01:11:13,001
Are you coming to bed?

807
01:11:13,402 --> 01:11:14,402
- No.

808
01:11:20,309 --> 01:11:22,510
I have some more work to do.

809
01:11:25,514 --> 01:11:28,583
- All right, see
you tomorrow, then.

810
01:13:02,978 --> 01:13:05,613
- Sergeant Griff meadows
of the police department.

811
01:13:05,615 --> 01:13:07,648
I'd like to ask you
a few questions.

812
01:13:07,650 --> 01:13:08,650
- Okay.

813
01:13:18,660 --> 01:13:21,662
- Does this look
familiar to you?

814
01:13:24,466 --> 01:13:26,567
- It's a witch bottle.

815
01:13:27,469 --> 01:13:29,570
- Do you have any idea
who could have made it?

816
01:13:29,572 --> 01:13:31,072
- No, no I don't.

817
01:13:34,643 --> 01:13:37,111
- Ever seen any of
these in here before?

818
01:13:37,113 --> 01:13:39,414
- Yeah, we have
some witch bottles.

819
01:13:39,416 --> 01:13:40,782
I'll show you one.

820
01:13:47,890 --> 01:13:48,890
Here's one.

821
01:13:52,728 --> 01:13:54,529
- How common are these bottles?

822
01:13:54,531 --> 01:13:55,930
- I've never seen 'em
in here before until

823
01:13:55,932 --> 01:13:58,933
a girl started
supplying 'em to us.

824
01:14:00,102 --> 01:14:01,736
- Who is this girl?

825
01:14:03,038 --> 01:14:06,040
- Her name is
Elaine, Elaine parks.

826
01:14:33,101 --> 01:14:34,168
- Who is it?

827
01:14:35,771 --> 01:14:39,006
- Sergeant meadows,
police department.

828
01:14:44,112 --> 01:14:46,547
Sorry to bother you, ma'am,
but I'm investigating a case

829
01:14:46,549 --> 01:14:49,617
and I just wanted to
ask you a few questions.

830
01:14:49,619 --> 01:14:50,551
- About what?

831
01:14:50,553 --> 01:14:53,754
- Well, it's a
potential homicide case.

832
01:14:53,756 --> 01:14:55,556
Just a routine check.

833
01:14:56,692 --> 01:14:59,026
I thought you might
be able to help us.

834
01:14:59,528 --> 01:15:00,628
- Of course.

835
01:15:02,264 --> 01:15:04,599
Please come in, sergeant.

836
01:15:11,573 --> 01:15:14,509
So you say there was a homicide.

837
01:15:14,843 --> 01:15:15,843
How horrible.

838
01:15:16,912 --> 01:15:18,212
Who was killed?

839
01:15:19,014 --> 01:15:20,648
- A man named Wayne Peters.

840
01:15:21,250 --> 01:15:22,850
Did you know Wayne Peters?

841
01:15:22,852 --> 01:15:23,852
- No.

842
01:15:26,555 --> 01:15:28,589
- Here's a picture of him.

843
01:15:28,591 --> 01:15:30,124
Ever seen him before?

844
01:15:30,126 --> 01:15:31,126
- No.

845
01:15:32,094 --> 01:15:33,761
I guess I can't
help you, sergeant.

846
01:15:33,763 --> 01:15:34,763
Good bye.

847
01:15:35,531 --> 01:15:36,531
- Ms. parks, wait.

848
01:15:42,905 --> 01:15:46,741
Have you ever seen
anything like this before?

849
01:15:47,609 --> 01:15:48,910
- It's a magic bottle.

850
01:15:49,578 --> 01:15:50,545
I made it myself.

851
01:15:50,547 --> 01:15:54,248
- Have you ever seen
one containing urine?

852
01:15:54,250 --> 01:15:55,550
- Urine?

853
01:15:56,652 --> 01:15:57,652
No.

854
01:16:08,297 --> 01:16:12,333
- We found this bottle containing
urine and a used tampon

855
01:16:13,702 --> 01:16:16,103
on the grave of Wayne Peters.

856
01:16:19,608 --> 01:16:22,109
- Will you excuse me
for a moment, sergeant?

857
01:16:27,316 --> 01:16:30,017
- Ms. parks, are you a witch?

858
01:16:30,352 --> 01:16:31,352
- Yes, I am.

859
01:16:32,154 --> 01:16:33,988
Is there a law against that?

860
01:16:33,990 --> 01:16:37,825
- I guess not, not unless
you do something wrong.

861
01:16:37,827 --> 01:16:40,127
- Do you think that being
a witch makes me evil,

862
01:16:40,129 --> 01:16:42,129
capable of murder even?

863
01:16:43,198 --> 01:16:45,600
- No, I wasn't
trying to imply...

864
01:16:46,702 --> 01:16:48,869
- Sergeant meadows, do
you know what it's like

865
01:16:48,871 --> 01:16:50,338
to really suffer?

866
01:16:51,808 --> 01:16:53,274
You have to fight and fight

867
01:16:53,276 --> 01:16:56,344
until you're too
exhausted to go on.

868
01:16:57,613 --> 01:16:59,680
Witchcraft is my
religion, sergeant.

869
01:17:00,916 --> 01:17:04,151
And this religion, which is
older than your Christianity,

870
01:17:04,653 --> 01:17:05,653
saved my life.

871
01:17:20,035 --> 01:17:23,771
- Ms. parks, I'm sorry
if I've offended you.

872
01:17:26,074 --> 01:17:27,375
I didn't realize.

873
01:17:31,046 --> 01:17:34,115
- That's all right,
sergeant Meadow.

874
01:17:39,655 --> 01:17:41,722
- You can call me Griff.

875
01:17:42,791 --> 01:17:43,791
- Griff?

876
01:17:46,896 --> 01:17:49,296
I know I've seen you before.

877
01:17:50,932 --> 01:17:53,000
I just don't know where.

878
01:17:54,069 --> 01:17:56,370
- I have that same feeling.

879
01:17:56,972 --> 01:17:57,972
- I know.

880
01:18:02,210 --> 01:18:04,412
You're the man in the cards.

881
01:18:05,881 --> 01:18:07,214
You're my fate.

882
01:18:08,450 --> 01:18:11,352
- What do you mean,
I'm your fate?

883
01:18:12,154 --> 01:18:14,255
- I did a Celtic cross reading.

884
01:18:15,390 --> 01:18:17,858
For my future card I
got knight of wands.

885
01:18:19,928 --> 01:18:24,165
Always felt that if that card
showed up in a future reading,

886
01:18:25,267 --> 01:18:27,702
soon meet the man that
I'm going to marry.

887
01:18:28,970 --> 01:18:31,472
But, the man that I marry
has to love animals.

888
01:18:32,274 --> 01:18:33,841
Do you like animals, Griff?

889
01:18:34,443 --> 01:18:36,477
- Why yes, I love animals.

890
01:18:37,345 --> 01:18:39,346
In fact, a friend of
mine has a couple horses

891
01:18:39,348 --> 01:18:40,848
I'm very fond of.

892
01:18:41,450 --> 01:18:43,718
You know, tomorrow is my day off

893
01:18:44,820 --> 01:18:47,321
and it's supposed to
be quite nice out.

894
01:18:47,323 --> 01:18:51,392
Maybe I'll get away from
the city and do some riding.

895
01:18:51,394 --> 01:18:53,794
Do you like to ride, Elaine?

896
01:19:22,224 --> 01:19:23,224
Whoa.

897
01:19:48,283 --> 01:19:51,552
- Oh patchouli, you're
such a sweetheart.

898
01:20:02,330 --> 01:20:03,531
- How's my girl?

899
01:20:04,466 --> 01:20:05,966
- Am I your girl?

900
01:20:06,434 --> 01:20:08,169
- For today you are.

901
01:20:09,337 --> 01:20:10,805
You're my girl and
there's nobody around

902
01:20:10,807 --> 01:20:12,406
to tell me otherwise.

903
01:20:14,409 --> 01:20:15,409
- Except me.

904
01:20:16,545 --> 01:20:18,412
- And what's that
supposed to mean?

905
01:20:18,414 --> 01:20:21,515
- Nothing.

906
01:20:35,030 --> 01:20:36,564
- What's that sound?

907
01:20:37,299 --> 01:20:38,499
- I don't know.

908
01:20:39,067 --> 01:20:40,067
Let's go see.

909
01:22:03,285 --> 01:22:06,587
- Now is the time of
the summer solstice.

910
01:22:07,923 --> 01:22:09,957
The strength of the
oak king is waning.

911
01:22:09,959 --> 01:22:13,160
And the Holly king stands
ready to challenge him

912
01:22:13,162 --> 01:22:15,963
for the hand of
the green maiden.

913
01:22:17,632 --> 01:22:19,600
- Let the battle begin.

914
01:22:25,307 --> 01:22:26,540
- Your season is over old man.

915
01:22:27,376 --> 01:22:28,575
- Oh never.

916
01:22:35,583 --> 01:22:37,151
- I will have her.

917
01:22:37,153 --> 01:22:38,185
- Never have her.

918
01:22:39,021 --> 01:22:40,021
- Never.

919
01:22:44,327 --> 01:22:46,660
- Holly king, I
name you the Victor.

920
01:22:46,662 --> 01:22:48,662
The green maiden is yours.

921
01:22:48,664 --> 01:22:49,664
- M'lady.

922
01:22:51,434 --> 01:22:52,434
Come on.

923
01:22:58,673 --> 01:22:59,673
- Elaine.

924
01:23:00,675 --> 01:23:02,242
- You know these people?

925
01:23:02,244 --> 01:23:04,044
- Well yes, in a way.

926
01:23:04,646 --> 01:23:06,280
- All hail, fair lord and lady.

927
01:23:06,282 --> 01:23:08,315
Welcome to our little gathering.

928
01:23:08,317 --> 01:23:09,317
- All hail.

929
01:23:10,485 --> 01:23:12,119
- We are the good people
of the renaissance

930
01:23:12,121 --> 01:23:16,290
and medieval players and we
are celebrating the mid-summer.

931
01:23:16,292 --> 01:23:17,658
Won't you join us?

932
01:23:18,460 --> 01:23:20,427
- To be sure, fair consort.

933
01:23:27,736 --> 01:23:29,536
- They are charming,
are they not?

934
01:23:29,538 --> 01:23:31,438
- Yes, quite charming.

935
01:23:32,440 --> 01:23:34,441
- I see two people in love.

936
01:23:35,243 --> 01:23:36,477
This calls for a wedding.

937
01:23:37,212 --> 01:23:38,212
- A wedding?

938
01:23:38,646 --> 01:23:40,047
- Yes, a mock
wedding, if you will.

939
01:23:40,049 --> 01:23:42,282
To honor the gods of love.

940
01:25:44,507 --> 01:25:45,606
- Okay.

941
01:27:07,422 --> 01:27:08,989
- Now, ye are wed.

942
01:27:17,398 --> 01:27:20,500
- I'm so happy for you,
Elaine, he's adorable.

943
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:54,301
- I'm not in love.

944
01:27:54,303 --> 01:27:56,003
It's not that I
don't have sentiment,

945
01:27:56,005 --> 01:27:57,904
it's just that love is soft.

946
01:27:57,906 --> 01:27:59,973
You need guts in this business.

947
01:27:59,975 --> 01:28:02,509
I've seen guys get shot to
death because they fell in love

948
01:28:02,511 --> 01:28:04,044
and got soft inside.

949
01:28:04,712 --> 01:28:06,480
I want an heir some day

950
01:28:06,482 --> 01:28:07,881
and then I would
need to have a wife,

951
01:28:07,883 --> 01:28:10,284
but love is something else.

952
01:28:10,286 --> 01:28:12,919
A man can get destroyed
by things like that.

953
01:28:12,921 --> 01:28:15,489
It's like he's not
even a man anymore.

954
01:28:15,491 --> 01:28:17,824
I never wanna get that way.

955
01:28:18,926 --> 01:28:21,528
- When you really love him,

956
01:28:21,530 --> 01:28:25,565
it's like fireworks and
nothing else matters.

957
01:28:26,401 --> 01:28:28,402
You love all the little
quirks about him.

958
01:28:28,404 --> 01:28:30,671
The way he slurps his cereal.

959
01:28:31,773 --> 01:28:33,974
The way his mouth
is a little crooked.

960
01:28:33,976 --> 01:28:37,944
Those details about him
become your whole life.

961
01:28:39,047 --> 01:28:41,748
Something inside you
opens up like a flower

962
01:28:42,850 --> 01:28:45,719
and you realize that you
have more love to give

963
01:28:45,721 --> 01:28:48,689
than you ever
thought was possible.

964
01:28:49,490 --> 01:28:51,858
'Cause the more you know him,

965
01:28:52,994 --> 01:28:54,895
the more you love him.

966
01:28:56,097 --> 01:28:57,731
- The more
you get to know a woman,

967
01:28:57,733 --> 01:29:00,467
the less you can feel about her.

968
01:29:00,469 --> 01:29:02,969
At first, she's this
incredible object of mystery

969
01:29:02,971 --> 01:29:06,506
who fulfills all you're
wildest fantasies.

970
01:29:06,508 --> 01:29:09,576
Then she starts to
reveal little flaws

971
01:29:09,578 --> 01:29:13,513
and after a while, just
gets pretty hard to care.

972
01:29:13,515 --> 01:29:16,950
Feminine ideal only
exists in a man's mind.

973
01:29:18,019 --> 01:29:20,687
No woman could ever fulfill it.

974
01:29:21,823 --> 01:29:23,924
And sometimes, when she
tries to love you more,

975
01:29:23,926 --> 01:29:27,994
give you more, you feel
like you're suffocating,

976
01:29:29,430 --> 01:29:31,064
drowning in estrogen.

977
01:29:32,567 --> 01:29:34,568
The most awful feeling.

978
01:29:42,510 --> 01:29:44,578
- Dinner tonight, Griff?

979
01:29:45,580 --> 01:29:47,114
- Um, can't tonight, Connie.

980
01:29:49,016 --> 01:29:50,617
Some other time.

981
01:29:56,491 --> 01:29:57,691
- Hey Griff, I got
more information

982
01:29:57,693 --> 01:29:59,493
on that Elaine parks girl.

983
01:29:59,495 --> 01:30:01,528
- You leave it on my desk.

984
01:30:02,530 --> 01:30:02,529
- Don't you wanna hear it?

985
01:30:02,531 --> 01:30:06,466
- Steve, captain wants
us to lay off the case.

986
01:30:06,468 --> 01:30:06,466
- Are you serious?

987
01:30:06,468 --> 01:30:11,571
- He says we have a policy
of leaving the witches alone.

988
01:30:11,573 --> 01:30:13,807
He says they've lived
in this town a long time

989
01:30:13,809 --> 01:30:15,642
and he doesn't like
to mess with them.

990
01:30:15,644 --> 01:30:17,544
- Even if they murder.

991
01:30:18,679 --> 01:30:20,080
- He says he's satisfied
that Wayne's death

992
01:30:20,082 --> 01:30:21,748
was a heart attack.

993
01:30:22,483 --> 01:30:23,583
I think so too.

994
01:30:27,455 --> 01:30:29,790
- Has everyone gone
crazy around here?

995
01:30:29,792 --> 01:30:33,026
Let me at least tell
you what I found.

996
01:30:37,899 --> 01:30:40,667
Now, Elaine used to run
an organic beauty store

997
01:30:40,669 --> 01:30:42,702
in Berkeley with
her husband, Jerry.

998
01:30:42,704 --> 01:30:44,438
Two years later
they were divorced

999
01:30:44,440 --> 01:30:46,039
and Elaine moved
to San Francisco

1000
01:30:46,041 --> 01:30:48,175
to start dancing
at a burlesque club

1001
01:30:48,177 --> 01:30:51,745
where she got involved
with a witch coven.

1002
01:30:59,053 --> 01:31:01,488
The coven broke up
after police questioning

1003
01:31:01,490 --> 01:31:03,924
when some of it's members
died mysteriously.

1004
01:31:03,926 --> 01:31:08,161
Soon after, Elaine's ex-husband
died of a drug overdose

1005
01:31:09,464 --> 01:31:12,666
shortly before he was
planning to remarry.

1006
01:31:13,468 --> 01:31:13,467
The police questioned Elaine

1007
01:31:13,469 --> 01:31:16,903
but they couldn't find
enough to hold her.

1008
01:31:16,905 --> 01:31:19,706
- Well, if the San Francisco
police couldn't find anything,

1009
01:31:19,708 --> 01:31:21,675
what happened there is
none of our business.

1010
01:31:21,677 --> 01:31:23,243
- Are you serious?

1011
01:31:24,545 --> 01:31:25,812
- I'd say this woman is
a dangerous character

1012
01:31:25,814 --> 01:31:27,948
and you better watch her.

1013
01:31:29,016 --> 01:31:30,617
- You mean because
she's a witch?

1014
01:31:30,619 --> 01:31:32,252
That doesn't mean anything.

1015
01:31:32,254 --> 01:31:36,490
- No, her husband died of a
drug he'd never taken before.

1016
01:31:36,492 --> 01:31:37,958
And did you ever find
where Wayne Peters

1017
01:31:37,960 --> 01:31:39,759
got the devil's weed?

1018
01:31:40,862 --> 01:31:42,929
- I questioned Ms.
Curtis about that.

1019
01:31:42,931 --> 01:31:45,899
There was devil's weed
growing near his cabin.

1020
01:31:45,901 --> 01:31:48,635
Apparently, he experimented
often with drugs.

1021
01:31:48,637 --> 01:31:50,737
- Come on Griff, can't
you connect the dots?

1022
01:31:50,739 --> 01:31:52,138
We have a possible murder here

1023
01:31:52,140 --> 01:31:54,774
and Elaine is our only suspect.

1024
01:31:55,877 --> 01:31:57,544
- I told you, we're
laying off her.

1025
01:31:57,546 --> 01:31:59,946
- Because of orders or because
you're in love with her?

1026
01:31:59,948 --> 01:32:01,548
- Who says I'm in love with her?

1027
01:32:01,550 --> 01:32:02,716
Get the hell off my back.

1028
01:32:08,089 --> 01:32:11,925
- You're out of line,
Griff, way out of line.

1029
01:32:46,795 --> 01:32:47,795
- Richard.

1030
01:32:50,565 --> 01:32:51,565
Richard!

1031
01:32:52,868 --> 01:32:53,868
Richard!

1032
01:32:54,335 --> 01:32:55,335
Richard!

1033
01:33:42,350 --> 01:33:44,618
- Thank you for
meeting me, Elaine.

1034
01:33:44,620 --> 01:33:47,320
It's not good for me
to be alone too much.

1035
01:33:47,322 --> 01:33:49,089
I know you're busy.

1036
01:33:49,091 --> 01:33:50,156
- Of course.

1037
01:33:50,825 --> 01:33:52,192
I wanted to come.

1038
01:33:54,328 --> 01:33:58,098
- I can't help but blaming
myself for what happened.

1039
01:33:58,100 --> 01:34:00,400
- You can't blame yourself.

1040
01:34:01,268 --> 01:34:03,637
You were a good wife to Richard.

1041
01:34:04,939 --> 01:34:06,339
- I tried to be.

1042
01:34:08,643 --> 01:34:11,011
I tried so hard to please him,

1043
01:34:12,013 --> 01:34:14,280
but I should have tried harder.

1044
01:34:14,282 --> 01:34:18,718
He wanted a certain type of
woman, someone I could never be.

1045
01:34:21,055 --> 01:34:22,856
Maybe you were right.

1046
01:34:23,924 --> 01:34:26,726
Maybe you should give
a man his fantasy.

1047
01:34:28,262 --> 01:34:32,265
I thought that was so
awful when you said that.

1048
01:34:32,933 --> 01:34:34,734
Maybe I was being naive,

1049
01:34:35,870 --> 01:34:38,371
but I really thought
he loved me for me.

1050
01:34:39,907 --> 01:34:41,808
But now, now I wish...

1051
01:34:46,280 --> 01:34:49,716
- You have to stop
torturing yourself.

1052
01:34:50,384 --> 01:34:51,418
You have to let go.

1053
01:34:51,420 --> 01:34:56,189
Remember how he changed
after my Dallas trip?

1054
01:34:56,191 --> 01:34:59,693
I think that's when he
started having that affair.

1055
01:34:59,695 --> 01:35:02,762
Whoever she was she
drove him crazy.

1056
01:35:04,065 --> 01:35:06,733
I hated him so much for that.

1057
01:35:07,401 --> 01:35:09,736
I wanted to kill them both.

1058
01:35:11,038 --> 01:35:14,340
If I ever found out who she
was, I would rip her to pieces.

1059
01:35:15,376 --> 01:35:18,378
But now I see I should
have helped him.

1060
01:35:19,947 --> 01:35:23,283
I didn't know that he was
going to take his own life.

1061
01:35:24,719 --> 01:35:25,719
- Hey,

1062
01:35:26,487 --> 01:35:27,487
hey.

1063
01:35:29,957 --> 01:35:31,725
- Enough about me.

1064
01:35:33,160 --> 01:35:34,994
What's going on with you?

1065
01:35:34,996 --> 01:35:38,064
- Trish, I'm in love.

1066
01:35:40,367 --> 01:35:41,434
- Who is he?

1067
01:35:41,436 --> 01:35:44,437
- He's a detective
and he's everything

1068
01:35:45,840 --> 01:35:47,407
a woman could ever want.

1069
01:35:48,442 --> 01:35:51,911
He's strong and
handsome, smart and kind.

1070
01:35:54,448 --> 01:35:57,016
I just know that he's the one.

1071
01:35:57,952 --> 01:36:00,186
He even gave me this ring.

1072
01:36:00,921 --> 01:36:02,455
I call it my magic ring.

1073
01:36:03,257 --> 01:36:03,256
It's not an engagement ring

1074
01:36:03,258 --> 01:36:08,428
but I just know that he's
gonna pop the question soon.

1075
01:36:22,746 --> 01:36:24,245
- When we first came here

1076
01:36:24,246 --> 01:36:28,848
I showed you my
engagement ring, remember?

1077
01:36:31,018 --> 01:36:32,485
I can barely stand to
look at it anymore.

1078
01:36:32,487 --> 01:36:34,187
It's too painful.

1079
01:36:36,457 --> 01:36:39,459
I'm sure he's going
to ask you soon.

1080
01:36:39,461 --> 01:36:42,796
You're going to make
a beautiful bride.

1081
01:36:43,464 --> 01:36:44,531
The first day we met,

1082
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,868
you were envious of
me because I had a man

1083
01:36:48,870 --> 01:36:50,870
and you were all alone.

1084
01:36:51,505 --> 01:36:53,540
Now it's the reverse.

1085
01:36:55,242 --> 01:36:57,310
Life is funny, isn't it?

1086
01:36:59,914 --> 01:37:02,515
- Trish, I'm sorry,
I've gotta go.

1087
01:37:02,517 --> 01:37:05,518
Would you like to
walk out with me?

1088
01:37:06,587 --> 01:37:09,389
- No, I'd like to stay
and finish my tea.

1089
01:37:09,924 --> 01:37:10,924
- All right.

1090
01:37:13,427 --> 01:37:14,828
Take care, love.

1091
01:37:55,236 --> 01:37:57,036
- Hi Elaine, it's me.

1092
01:37:57,605 --> 01:37:59,439
Yeah, you left your ring here.

1093
01:37:59,441 --> 01:38:02,909
You're probably driving but
I'll drop it by on my way home.

1094
01:38:02,911 --> 01:38:04,444
See you in a minute.

1095
01:43:27,968 --> 01:43:29,235
- You bitch.

1096
01:43:30,838 --> 01:43:32,738
You killed my husband.

1097
01:43:36,643 --> 01:43:38,578
Bitch, skank, whore.

1098
01:43:53,227 --> 01:43:54,827
You'll burn for this.

1099
01:44:05,272 --> 01:44:06,973
- Crash, crash, crash.

1100
01:44:08,508 --> 01:44:09,742
Die, die, die.

1101
01:45:01,295 --> 01:45:03,562
- Oh Habondia, bind these two

1102
01:45:04,631 --> 01:45:06,866
with a heady lovers' brew.

1103
01:45:07,668 --> 01:45:10,369
Even should they strive to flee

1104
01:45:10,971 --> 01:45:12,938
they'll cling for all eternity.

1105
01:45:24,685 --> 01:45:25,685
- Scotch.

1106
01:45:42,602 --> 01:45:44,503
- Bottle o' beer, Sam.

1107
01:45:51,445 --> 01:45:53,512
Who are those new girls?

1108
01:45:53,980 --> 01:45:55,715
They can't dance at all.

1109
01:45:56,583 --> 01:45:57,616
And they're weird.

1110
01:46:02,589 --> 01:46:06,625
- I don't know, but the
customers really like 'em.

1111
01:46:07,728 --> 01:46:08,928
- They're friends
of the witches.

1112
01:46:08,930 --> 01:46:10,930
I seen them come
in together before.

1113
01:46:10,932 --> 01:46:12,665
- Yeah, the witches.

1114
01:46:14,034 --> 01:46:15,668
They're everywhere.

1115
01:46:16,570 --> 01:46:17,803
- One gin and tonic, Sam.

1116
01:46:17,805 --> 01:46:20,039
- Gin and tonic coming up.

1117
01:46:20,807 --> 01:46:22,074
- Did you read about the teacher

1118
01:46:22,076 --> 01:46:24,110
buried in the back
yard of his cabin?

1119
01:46:24,112 --> 01:46:26,579
They said it was
dug by the witches.

1120
01:46:26,581 --> 01:46:26,579
- Oh yeah, I read about that.

1121
01:46:26,581 --> 01:46:31,083
They found all kinds of
witchcraft things on the grave.

1122
01:46:31,085 --> 01:46:33,552
- Yeah, I heard about that, too.

1123
01:46:33,554 --> 01:46:34,554
Creepy.

1124
01:46:52,440 --> 01:46:53,873
- Sit down, Elaine.

1125
01:47:01,581 --> 01:47:04,683
Elaine, the DNA came
back from the lab.

1126
01:47:06,887 --> 01:47:09,789
It connects you
with Wayne Peters.

1127
01:47:13,593 --> 01:47:15,027
Patricia Manning
came by the station.

1128
01:47:15,029 --> 01:47:16,862
Some things of yours.

1129
01:47:18,665 --> 01:47:19,965
Including this.

1130
01:47:22,068 --> 01:47:25,638
She said you drove her
husband to suicide.

1131
01:47:29,009 --> 01:47:30,976
- So, I was a bad girl.

1132
01:47:31,778 --> 01:47:33,913
Are you going to punish me?

1133
01:47:35,582 --> 01:47:38,818
- What sort of person
are you, Elaine?

1134
01:47:39,953 --> 01:47:42,688
What sort of sick mind
would do such things?

1135
01:47:43,457 --> 01:47:44,957
- Why are you so negative?

1136
01:47:44,959 --> 01:47:46,759
I didn't kill anyone.

1137
01:47:47,561 --> 01:47:49,695
Wayne died of heart failure

1138
01:47:50,797 --> 01:47:53,532
after a beautiful
night of lovemaking.

1139
01:47:54,234 --> 01:47:57,703
And Richard died because
he loved me too much.

1140
01:47:59,105 --> 01:48:00,573
These men weren't used to
the deep feelings of love

1141
01:48:00,575 --> 01:48:02,908
that they were
experiencing with me.

1142
01:48:02,910 --> 01:48:05,544
- Are you saying these
men died of love?

1143
01:48:05,546 --> 01:48:06,779
That's insane.

1144
01:48:07,781 --> 01:48:10,649
What about the
spells and the drugs?

1145
01:48:11,852 --> 01:48:13,552
Are you saying witchcraft
had nothing to do with it?

1146
01:48:13,554 --> 01:48:17,089
- Witchcraft is just a way
of concentrating energy.

1147
01:48:17,091 --> 01:48:20,125
It can only work with
what's already there.

1148
01:48:20,127 --> 01:48:23,696
I just use sex magic
to create love magic.

1149
01:48:24,731 --> 01:48:27,233
I didn't know how strong
the spells would be.

1150
01:48:27,235 --> 01:48:30,569
Sometimes it's almost scary
how strong the love gets.

1151
01:48:30,571 --> 01:48:31,670
- Love?

1152
01:48:32,772 --> 01:48:35,174
What do you know about love?

1153
01:48:36,243 --> 01:48:39,678
What you call love is a
borderline personality disorder

1154
01:48:40,514 --> 01:48:41,614
or worse.

1155
01:48:42,249 --> 01:48:43,983
- Don't diagnose me.

1156
01:48:45,218 --> 01:48:48,254
Maybe you're a narcissist
who can't love.

1157
01:48:49,556 --> 01:48:51,023
You think that I'm sick

1158
01:48:51,025 --> 01:48:54,560
because you've never
loved like I have.

1159
01:48:55,262 --> 01:48:57,663
Well, I would do
anything for love.

1160
01:48:59,633 --> 01:49:03,669
- That's right, you'll
never get enough love.

1161
01:49:04,804 --> 01:49:07,540
Even when a man loves
you so much it kills him,

1162
01:49:07,542 --> 01:49:09,241
it's not enough for you.

1163
01:49:09,243 --> 01:49:11,544
You're like a bottomless hole.

1164
01:49:11,546 --> 01:49:15,814
You doll yourself up and
do the Stepford wife thing

1165
01:49:17,117 --> 01:49:19,852
thinking every man is
going to fall at your feet.

1166
01:49:19,854 --> 01:49:24,089
But your creepy little sexy
act doesn't work with me.

1167
01:49:26,660 --> 01:49:28,127
I don't love you.

1168
01:49:34,267 --> 01:49:36,302
- How can you stand
there and boast

1169
01:49:36,304 --> 01:49:38,604
about being immune to love?

1170
01:49:39,973 --> 01:49:43,609
Why does the genuine love of
a woman scare you so much?

1171
01:49:44,778 --> 01:49:47,313
You think that your way
is a superior way to live?

1172
01:49:47,315 --> 01:49:50,215
I know a lot of women who
feel the way that I do.

1173
01:49:50,217 --> 01:49:53,953
Only men make us work
so hard for your love.

1174
01:49:55,689 --> 01:49:59,091
If you would just
love us for ourselves,

1175
01:50:01,728 --> 01:50:02,962
but you won't.

1176
01:50:04,898 --> 01:50:07,633
My ex-husband was just like you.

1177
01:50:08,935 --> 01:50:12,671
He used to punish me by
withholding his love from me.

1178
01:50:13,807 --> 01:50:16,675
All my life I've been
tossed in the garbage

1179
01:50:17,711 --> 01:50:20,813
except when men
wanted to use my body.

1180
01:50:22,315 --> 01:50:25,284
So, I decided to
find my own power.

1181
01:50:26,386 --> 01:50:29,622
And I found that power
through witchcraft.

1182
01:50:30,690 --> 01:50:33,359
That means that I take
what I need from men

1183
01:50:33,361 --> 01:50:35,861
and not the other way around.

1184
01:50:38,665 --> 01:50:40,399
- I'm sorry, Elaine.

1185
01:50:42,936 --> 01:50:45,004
It won't work this time.

1186
01:50:46,139 --> 01:50:48,907
I'm afraid I'm going
to have to arrest you.

1187
01:50:48,909 --> 01:50:49,909
- What for?

1188
01:50:51,645 --> 01:50:54,780
Marrying a lover
according to my religion?

1189
01:50:54,782 --> 01:50:56,749
Seducing a married man?

1190
01:50:57,917 --> 01:50:59,685
I know 400 years ago
you could be burned

1191
01:50:59,687 --> 01:51:02,855
for a thing like
that, but not today.

1192
01:51:06,092 --> 01:51:07,359
- No, not burned,

1193
01:51:10,363 --> 01:51:14,400
but you'll be booked for
burying Wayne Peters illegally

1194
01:51:15,368 --> 01:51:17,436
and we'll find out more.

1195
01:51:18,805 --> 01:51:22,708
- Oh, that's the witch
who killed the teacher.

1196
01:51:24,010 --> 01:51:27,179
- Thou shalt not
suffer a witch to live.

1197
01:51:31,786 --> 01:51:32,818
- Burn the witch.

1198
01:51:32,820 --> 01:51:34,319
- Burn the witch.

1199
01:51:34,988 --> 01:51:34,987
- Burn the witch.

1200
01:51:34,989 --> 01:51:37,690
- Burn the witch, burn
the witch, burn the witch,

1201
01:51:37,692 --> 01:51:40,926
burn the witch, burn the
witch, burn the witch,

1202
01:51:40,928 --> 01:51:44,463
burn the witch, burn the
witch, burn the witch,

1203
01:51:44,465 --> 01:51:47,433
burn the witch, burn the
witch, burn the witch,

1204
01:51:47,435 --> 01:51:51,103
burn the witch, burn the
witch, burn the witch,

1205
01:51:51,105 --> 01:51:53,739
burn the witch, burn the
witch, burn the witch,

1206
01:51:53,741 --> 01:51:55,808
burn the witch, burn the
witch, burn the witch,

1207
01:51:55,810 --> 01:51:58,744
burn the witch, burn the
witch, burn the witch,

1208
01:51:58,746 --> 01:52:01,180
burn the witch, burn the
witch, burn the witch,

1209
01:52:01,182 --> 01:52:03,282
burn the witch, burn the
witch, burn the witch,

1210
01:52:03,284 --> 01:52:07,052
burn the witch, burn the
witch, burn the witch,

1211
01:52:07,054 --> 01:52:09,888
burn the witch, burn the
witch, burn the witch,

1212
01:52:09,890 --> 01:52:13,425
burn the witch, burn the
witch, burn the witch,

1213
01:52:13,427 --> 01:52:15,494
burn the witch, burn the
witch, burn the witch,

1214
01:52:15,496 --> 01:52:18,997
burn the witch, burn the
witch, burn the witch.,

1215
01:52:18,999 --> 01:52:22,000
burn the witch, burn the
witch, burn the witch,

1216
01:52:22,002 --> 01:52:26,004
burn the witch, burn the
witch, burn the witch.

1217
01:52:26,973 --> 01:52:27,973
- Burn!

1218
01:52:28,208 --> 01:52:28,841
- Burn her.

1219
01:52:28,843 --> 01:52:29,341
- Burn.

1220
01:52:29,343 --> 01:52:30,442
Burn.

1221
01:52:56,002 --> 01:52:57,069
- Poor baby.

1222
01:52:58,104 --> 01:52:59,505
Poor, poor baby.

1223
01:53:05,445 --> 01:53:08,514
Don't worry,
everything will be okay

1224
01:53:10,517 --> 01:53:13,051
because I love you so much.

1225
01:54:43,610 --> 01:54:45,410
- I love you, Elaine.

1226
01:54:46,980 --> 01:54:48,580
- I love you, Elaine.

1227
01:54:49,883 --> 01:54:51,483
- I love you, Elaine.

1228
01:56:03,323 --> 01:56:05,157
- I love you, Elaine.

1229
01:56:06,459 --> 01:56:09,194
I've never loved anyone but you.

1230
01:56:09,729 --> 01:56:11,463
I want to marry you.
