00:01:38,817 --> 00:01:44,185
<b>GOD'S NOT DEAD 2</b>

2
00:01:45,815 --> 00:01:48,815
<b>Subrip: Pix</b>

3
00:03:44,205 --> 00:03:47,143
Brooke, we're all upset,
but we need to move on.

4
00:03:47,175 --> 00:03:49,411
Honey, you're a junior now.
It's your make-or-break year.

5
00:03:49,444 --> 00:03:51,680
So there's no room
for self pity.

6
00:03:53,314 --> 00:03:55,617
Can you give Marlene and I
a ride to school today?

7
00:03:55,651 --> 00:03:57,237
I'm sorry.
I don't have time.

8
00:03:57,238 --> 00:04:00,189
I have an 8:30 with Marc
Shelley at White & Wolfe.

9
00:04:00,222 --> 00:04:03,426
What? Richard, you didn't say anything!
How did you get the meeting?

10
00:04:03,459 --> 00:04:08,264
It's just a meeting, so don't get
too excited. But it could be huge.

11
00:04:08,296 --> 00:04:10,032
I know!

12
00:04:10,066 --> 00:04:11,601
Who's going to
the meeting with you?

13
00:04:11,602 --> 00:04:13,135
Hey, I got the meeting.

14
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:15,638
I just think maybe you should
take Melinda or Janice.

15
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:17,639
Janice? You want
me to take Janice?

16
00:04:17,673 --> 00:04:19,274
-Yeah. Why not?
-I'm not taking Janice.

17
00:04:19,307 --> 00:04:22,110
-Rough morning?
-You know my parents.

18
00:04:22,144 --> 00:04:25,180
Maybe they just
need a little more time.

19
00:04:25,213 --> 00:04:28,050
I don't know
about that.

20
00:04:28,084 --> 00:04:30,218
I'd say they're
pretty over it.

21
00:04:30,252 --> 00:04:35,223
My mom's making tacos tonight.
I'll let her know you're coming.

22
00:04:35,257 --> 00:04:37,126
It's not like
they'll miss me.

23
00:04:37,158 --> 00:04:40,730
Brooke, I'm serious, honey.
You need to get focused.

24
00:04:40,762 --> 00:04:44,199
Or you can say, "Good-bye,
Stanford, hello, Somewhere State."

25
00:04:44,233 --> 00:04:45,769
Got it.

26
00:04:49,572 --> 00:04:51,774
Yikes.

27
00:04:51,807 --> 00:04:53,158
Good morning!

28
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:54,509
Morning, Grace.

29
00:04:54,543 --> 00:04:57,312
You don't have to
keep doing this.

30
00:04:57,346 --> 00:04:59,615
Are you kidding? This is the
best part of my day, Gramps.

31
00:04:59,648 --> 00:05:02,218
Well, pills first.

32
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:04,286
You're a good girl.

33
00:05:06,488 --> 00:05:09,625
Honey, you know I'm not
gonna be around here forever,

34
00:05:09,658 --> 00:05:13,830
and you might wanna start
thinking about some other guy

35
00:05:13,862 --> 00:05:16,065
you wanna have breakfast with.

36
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:18,434
I'll work on that.

37
00:05:18,466 --> 00:05:21,437
Okay.

38
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:23,739
You know, I love the way
you do the oatmeal,

39
00:05:23,771 --> 00:05:28,110
but what do you say I take you out
for bacon and eggs this morning.

40
00:05:28,144 --> 00:05:29,579
My treat.

41
00:05:29,612 --> 00:05:32,215
Not after your
last cholesterol test.

42
00:05:32,247 --> 00:05:35,117
Besides, I have some papers I have
to grade before the staff meeting.

43
00:05:35,151 --> 00:05:39,355
I'm 81 years old, and bacon is
not gonna be what kills me.

44
00:05:39,387 --> 00:05:42,558
Nice try. You're 82.

45
00:05:47,896 --> 00:05:49,598
Yeah.

46
00:05:49,632 --> 00:05:52,668
-Good morning.
-Have a nice day.

47
00:05:52,701 --> 00:05:54,370
Morning, ladies.
Morning.

48
00:05:55,637 --> 00:05:58,207
Good morning.

49
00:06:01,776 --> 00:06:05,281
Hey, what do you call
a teacher with no students?

50
00:06:05,314 --> 00:06:06,682
Unemployed.

51
00:06:06,714 --> 00:06:08,450
I got it.
How about ecstatic?

52
00:06:08,483 --> 00:06:10,685
You're both right.
Retired.

53
00:06:10,718 --> 00:06:13,656
Only 36 days to go.

54
00:06:13,689 --> 00:06:16,492
You're gonna miss the kids
when you're gone, Rizzo.

55
00:06:16,524 --> 00:06:19,495
No, Grace, that's sweet,
but no, I won't.

56
00:06:19,528 --> 00:06:22,564
The older I get, the more difficult
these kids are to deal with.

57
00:06:22,598 --> 00:06:25,168
I totally agree. Yesterday, I just
about snapped at Tim Webster.

58
00:06:25,201 --> 00:06:27,170
That boy had me
on my last nerve.

59
00:06:27,202 --> 00:06:30,205
Well, I happen to think that difficult
students can be a blessing.

60
00:06:30,238 --> 00:06:32,774
Grace, honey, when is this
optimism ever gonna wear off?

61
00:06:37,779 --> 00:06:39,347
Bill.

62
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:40,882
Bill.

63
00:06:40,915 --> 00:06:42,618
Bill.

64
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:46,288
Junk mail.

65
00:06:48,223 --> 00:06:49,791
Man!

66
00:06:49,824 --> 00:06:53,795
David, why are
you always so sad?

67
00:06:53,829 --> 00:06:57,833
Hey! You're back.
Why are you back?

68
00:06:57,865 --> 00:07:01,570
My pastor gave me permission to
finish my doctorate at Hadleigh,

69
00:07:01,603 --> 00:07:04,973
so if that's okay with you,
I'm gonna be here for a while.

70
00:07:06,975 --> 00:07:09,845
David, you are a mess.
What happened to you?

71
00:07:09,877 --> 00:07:11,514
I woke up.

72
00:07:14,283 --> 00:07:18,687
Okay, for 500 points, for all
the cheese, for the game.

73
00:07:18,721 --> 00:07:21,723
This quote
is from what document?

74
00:07:21,757 --> 00:07:23,959
"We hold these truths
to be self-evident,

75
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,427
that all men are created equal,

76
00:07:25,461 --> 00:07:27,797
that they are endowed by their creator
with certain unalienable rights..."

77
00:07:27,829 --> 00:07:30,665
Boom, baby!

78
00:07:30,699 --> 00:07:32,401
Team 1,
what's your answer?

79
00:07:32,434 --> 00:07:34,470
Our answer is the Declaration
of Independence.

80
00:07:35,571 --> 00:07:37,506
That's...

81
00:07:37,538 --> 00:07:39,541
correct!
Team 1 wins!

82
00:07:42,877 --> 00:07:45,909
Okay, monday we will
examine the assertion

83
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:49,685
of individual rights through the
last century. Have a good weekend.

84
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:56,725
Brooke, are you okay?

85
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:58,694
I'm fine.

86
00:07:59,495 --> 00:08:00,896
Are you sure?

87
00:08:00,928 --> 00:08:03,265
Yeah, thanks.

88
00:08:18,514 --> 00:08:19,848
Ms. Ryan?

89
00:08:42,538 --> 00:08:44,573
I lied.

90
00:08:47,676 --> 00:08:49,745
Are you sure
you're being fair?

91
00:08:49,778 --> 00:08:54,082
Trust me. They're over it. And
they expect me to be over it too.

92
00:08:54,115 --> 00:08:57,819
It's like to them
never even existed.

93
00:08:57,852 --> 00:08:59,688
The only thing
that I know for sure

94
00:08:59,721 --> 00:09:03,425
is that I'm never going
to see my brother again.

95
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:05,527
Everybody's asked if there's
anything that they can do.

96
00:09:05,561 --> 00:09:07,797
The truth is,
no one can do anything

97
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:10,432
because the only thing I really
want is five more minutes

98
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:13,668
to tell my brother
how I really felt about him.

99
00:09:13,701 --> 00:09:16,773
Did you brother believe
there was something more?

100
00:09:17,706 --> 00:09:19,608
I don't know.

101
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,043
Do you?

102
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,251
Brooke, every person
reaches a point in their

103
00:09:26,252 --> 00:09:27,983
life when they ask
themselves this question.

104
00:09:28,015 --> 00:09:31,553
There's nothing wrong
with you asking it too.

105
00:09:33,889 --> 00:09:36,558
You never let anything
get to you.

106
00:09:36,591 --> 00:09:38,694
How do you do that?

107
00:09:40,995 --> 00:09:42,597
Jesus.

108
00:10:03,951 --> 00:10:05,153
Hello?

109
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:07,389
How'd it go, Amy?

110
00:10:07,423 --> 00:10:08,658
<i>Michael.</i>

111
00:10:09,991 --> 00:10:11,927
It's gone.

112
00:10:13,461 --> 00:10:16,631
My cancer's... It's gone.

113
00:10:16,664 --> 00:10:18,800
My goodness!

114
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:20,836
That's incredible!

115
00:10:20,837 --> 00:10:22,838
<i>I know. I just...</i>

116
00:10:23,938 --> 00:10:25,140
I can't believe it.

117
00:10:26,808 --> 00:10:28,810
Isn't that
what you prayed for?

118
00:10:28,844 --> 00:10:30,413
Yes, of course.
I just...

119
00:10:32,748 --> 00:10:35,551
Prayer
is a powerful thing,

120
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:39,554
and it turns out God has
much bigger plans for you.

121
00:10:50,065 --> 00:10:52,435
You okay, Grace?

122
00:10:52,467 --> 00:10:54,937
Yeah, I just can't stop
thinking about Brooke.

123
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:58,106
You know, she's searching.
She's hurting.

124
00:10:58,139 --> 00:11:02,144
Yeah, that's the thing
about atheism.

125
00:11:02,177 --> 00:11:05,915
It doesn't take away the pain.
It just takes away the hope.

126
00:11:07,048 --> 00:11:08,500
What'd you tell her?

127
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:09,951
The truth.

128
00:11:09,985 --> 00:11:12,988
Now she's free to
make her own choice.

129
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:15,591
Unfortunately,
in this day and age,

130
00:11:15,624 --> 00:11:19,628
people seem to forget that the
most basic human right of all

131
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:21,763
is the right
to know Jesus.

132
00:11:21,797 --> 00:11:23,865
Let's put her
on the prayer list.

133
00:11:23,899 --> 00:11:27,068
Prayer always seems to be
the last thing we do,

134
00:11:27,101 --> 00:11:29,538
when it should be the first.

135
00:11:31,038 --> 00:11:33,107
Now, how 'bout
some more popcorn?

136
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:36,945
With a glycemic index
of 100, not a chance.

137
00:11:36,979 --> 00:11:39,148
I swear, Grace, if you
don't start feeding me better,

138
00:11:39,181 --> 00:11:41,684
I'm gonna leave you
for a nursing home.

139
00:11:42,817 --> 00:11:45,086
Well, that's it for me.

140
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,956
I'm going to bed.

141
00:11:46,989 --> 00:11:48,157
Love ya.

142
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:50,192
I love you better.

143
00:11:50,225 --> 00:11:52,094
Love you first.

144
00:11:52,126 --> 00:11:53,862
That's unfair.

145
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:57,667
Gotcha!

146
00:12:02,604 --> 00:12:04,298
Brooke,

147
00:12:04,299 --> 00:12:06,642
the people from that charity place are
here to pick up your brother's things.

148
00:12:06,674 --> 00:12:09,144
Can you make sure
they get everything?

149
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:12,882
And don't forget to
put the milk away!

150
00:13:37,899 --> 00:13:40,369
Well,
that's the last of it.

151
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:42,271
Thank you.

152
00:13:42,303 --> 00:13:45,374
And while I was loading one
of the boxes onto the truck,

153
00:13:45,407 --> 00:13:49,812
I noticed this and I thought
you might want to keep it.

154
00:13:49,845 --> 00:13:51,614
So sorry for your loss.

155
00:14:35,356 --> 00:14:39,995
So peaceful nonviolence comes
first in India under Gandhi,

156
00:14:40,028 --> 00:14:43,298
and then later, here in the United
States under Dr. King and others

157
00:14:43,331 --> 00:14:45,734
as a means of
achieving civil rights.

158
00:14:45,767 --> 00:14:48,903
But what makes
nonviolence so radical

159
00:14:48,937 --> 00:14:51,940
is its unwavering commitment
to a nonviolent approach,

160
00:14:51,972 --> 00:14:55,144
not just initially, but in the
face of escalating persecution

161
00:14:55,177 --> 00:14:57,745
by the opposing force.

162
00:14:57,778 --> 00:14:59,313
Yes?

163
00:14:59,346 --> 00:15:02,016
Isn't that sort of
like what Jesus meant

164
00:15:02,049 --> 00:15:04,853
when said that we
should love our enemies?

165
00:15:07,121 --> 00:15:09,190
Yes.

166
00:15:09,224 --> 00:15:12,094
The writer
of the gospel of Matthew

167
00:15:12,126 --> 00:15:14,929
records Jesus as saying,
"You have heard it said,

168
00:15:14,962 --> 00:15:17,298
love your neighbor
and hate your enemy,

169
00:15:17,331 --> 00:15:20,302
but I tell you,
love your enemies

170
00:15:20,335 --> 00:15:23,172
and pray for those
who persecute you,

171
00:15:23,205 --> 00:15:26,075
that you will be children
of your father in heaven,"

172
00:15:26,107 --> 00:15:29,277
which indicates
a commitment to nonviolence.

173
00:15:29,311 --> 00:15:33,215
Dr. King confirmed the link, describing
his inspiration from Scripture,

174
00:15:33,248 --> 00:15:36,884
saying Christ furnished
the spirit and motivation,

175
00:15:36,918 --> 00:15:38,419
while Gandhi
furnished the method.

176
00:15:38,452 --> 00:15:43,858
Except that that didn't work. Jesus got
himself killed. Everybody knows that.

177
00:15:43,892 --> 00:15:46,361
Well, so did Dr. King.

178
00:15:46,394 --> 00:15:50,932
So I guess it just depends
on how you measure success.

179
00:15:50,966 --> 00:15:53,435
Both men created movements
that survive to this day,

180
00:15:53,467 --> 00:15:56,270
even though both
paid the ultimate price

181
00:15:56,303 --> 00:15:58,139
for their commitment
to their ideals.

182
00:15:58,173 --> 00:16:00,109
I still wouldn't do it.

183
00:16:00,142 --> 00:16:02,945
Well, not very many people
have that kind of courage.

184
00:16:02,977 --> 00:16:06,013
But I, for one, am grateful
for those that do,

185
00:16:06,047 --> 00:16:10,018
you know, those who stand up
for what they believe.

186
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:17,158
Have a good day.

187
00:16:31,807 --> 00:16:33,274
Are you Pastor Dave?

188
00:16:33,307 --> 00:16:34,809
I am.

189
00:16:34,842 --> 00:16:35,910
I'm Martin Yip.

190
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:36,978
Nice to meet you.

191
00:16:37,011 --> 00:16:39,947
My friend Josh Wheaton
said you might be able

192
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:42,451
to answer my questions
about God.

193
00:16:42,484 --> 00:16:45,321
Well, that definitely falls
within my job description.

194
00:16:47,822 --> 00:16:49,357
How many questions
have you got?

195
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:52,060
So far, 147.

196
00:16:54,328 --> 00:16:55,813
Is something wrong?

197
00:16:55,814 --> 00:16:57,298
No.

198
00:16:57,331 --> 00:17:00,903
Josh encouraged me to write them down
and be as comprehensive as possible.

199
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:03,872
Of course did. I'll have to
thank him next time I see him.

200
00:17:03,904 --> 00:17:05,106
Come on.

201
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,909
So, what's
your first question?

202
00:17:08,542 --> 00:17:12,548
Grace, I just have
to hear it from you.

203
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:14,549
Did this happen?

204
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:18,954
If you're asking whether I responded
to a student's question, yes.

205
00:17:18,987 --> 00:17:22,356
If you're asking whether
her question and my answer

206
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:23,923
both referenced Jesus
as it was relevant

207
00:17:23,924 --> 00:17:28,090
to the history lesson we were
discussing, again, I'd have to say...

208
00:17:28,091 --> 00:17:29,244
yes.

209
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,804
Good afternoon,
Ms. Wesley.

210
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:43,846
I've asked Bob Fessler to sit
in... he's the school's attorney...

211
00:17:43,878 --> 00:17:47,548
To advise us on any legal issues
we might be brushing up against.

212
00:17:47,582 --> 00:17:50,052
Should I have
a lawyer too?

213
00:17:50,085 --> 00:17:52,520
I don't see
the need for that.

214
00:17:52,554 --> 00:17:55,423
Ms. Rizzo is present
as your union representation.

215
00:17:57,325 --> 00:17:59,061
Okay.

216
00:17:59,094 --> 00:18:01,897
We are here to hear
your side of the story.

217
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:06,468
Now, I understand a student in
your second-period history class

218
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,936
asked a question
about the parallels

219
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:11,440
between
the teachings of Gandhi

220
00:18:11,472 --> 00:18:13,509
and remarks
allegedly made by Jesus.

221
00:18:15,042 --> 00:18:17,111
Yes, that's correct.

222
00:18:17,144 --> 00:18:22,617
And your answer incorporated specific
detailed reference to those teachings

223
00:18:22,651 --> 00:18:24,486
that included
Scripture itself,

224
00:18:25,619 --> 00:18:27,255
the words of Jesus.

225
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:30,292
Yes.

226
00:18:30,325 --> 00:18:33,061
What were you thinking,
Grace?

227
00:18:33,094 --> 00:18:37,499
Do you believe your response was
in line with district policy?

228
00:18:37,531 --> 00:18:39,667
Yes.

229
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:44,405
As well as in compliance with
state and federal guidelines?

230
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,276
Yes, sir.

231
00:18:47,308 --> 00:18:49,110
Well, Ms. Wesley,

232
00:18:51,112 --> 00:18:53,115
unfortunately for you,

233
00:18:53,147 --> 00:18:56,951
I'm fairly certain the
school board will disagree.

234
00:19:00,587 --> 00:19:03,057
No, Coach,
you're not hearing me.

235
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:04,926
No prayers.

236
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,196
No moments of silence.
Nothing.

237
00:19:08,229 --> 00:19:09,932
<i>It's tradition
on the field.</i>

238
00:19:09,964 --> 00:19:12,067
Not on the field,
not in the locker room,

239
00:19:12,099 --> 00:19:14,302
not in the parking lot
for that matter, okay?

240
00:19:14,336 --> 00:19:16,171
<i>-Whatever you say.
-Okay, thanks, Coach.</i>

241
00:19:16,203 --> 00:19:18,139
Come on in.

242
00:19:18,173 --> 00:19:21,375
-Hi, Brooke.
-You wanted to see me?

243
00:19:21,409 --> 00:19:25,047
Ms. Wesley is currently
under disciplinary review.

244
00:19:25,079 --> 00:19:28,250
All of her classes have been
reassigned until things are settled.

245
00:19:28,282 --> 00:19:30,351
I don't want you to have
any contact with her.

246
00:19:30,384 --> 00:19:33,454
None whatsoever, either
on or off school property.

247
00:19:33,488 --> 00:19:35,390
Do I have any say in this?

248
00:19:35,423 --> 00:19:39,728
No, I've already discussed things
with your father and agrees.

249
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,963
Since when
does my dad care?

250
00:19:41,997 --> 00:19:46,201
Brooke, the important thing for you to
remember is you've done nothing wrong.

251
00:19:46,233 --> 00:19:48,669
Neither did Ms. Wesley. All she
did was answer a question.

252
00:19:48,702 --> 00:19:52,307
Ms. Wesley's answer was not in
line with school policy. -Really?

253
00:19:52,339 --> 00:19:55,343
Aren't we allowed to say what we
believe? When did that change?

254
00:19:55,376 --> 00:19:56,803
I'm not gonna argue with you,

255
00:19:56,804 --> 00:19:58,980
and I don't want you discussing
the situation with anyone.

256
00:19:59,013 --> 00:20:00,448
Do you understand?

257
00:20:01,615 --> 00:20:03,685
Do you understand?

258
00:20:06,721 --> 00:20:08,022
Yes.

259
00:20:22,604 --> 00:20:24,573
Grace?

260
00:20:24,605 --> 00:20:26,508
-Are you...
-Tom Endler.

261
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:28,442
Your union-appointed
attorney.

262
00:20:28,476 --> 00:20:29,995
You don't look
like a lawyer.

263
00:20:29,996 --> 00:20:31,513
Thank you.

264
00:20:31,546 --> 00:20:34,449
I'm not sure I meant
that as a compliment.

265
00:20:34,481 --> 00:20:37,086
I'm determined to take
it as one. Shall we sit?

266
00:20:40,355 --> 00:20:43,357
So, have you defended
many teachers

267
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:45,060
in disciplinary matters?

268
00:20:45,093 --> 00:20:47,028
Nope, you're my first.

269
00:20:47,061 --> 00:20:49,563
Just hired on from
the public defender's office.

270
00:20:49,596 --> 00:20:52,600
Criminal law? No offense,
but I'm not a criminal.

271
00:20:52,634 --> 00:20:56,505
Don't be so sure of that. Your kind of
case makes everybody uncomfortable.

272
00:20:56,538 --> 00:20:59,407
School boards,
teachers, parents.

273
00:20:59,441 --> 00:21:01,509
Makes them feel... yucky.

274
00:21:01,542 --> 00:21:03,310
"Yucky"?

275
00:21:03,344 --> 00:21:05,346
Is that a technical
legal term?

276
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:08,316
You got a better word for it?

277
00:21:08,348 --> 00:21:10,519
Grace, I'm gonna
level with you.

278
00:21:10,551 --> 00:21:12,319
Nobody wants your case.

279
00:21:12,353 --> 00:21:14,756
I drew it because
I'm low man on the totem pole

280
00:21:14,788 --> 00:21:16,825
in a place where
seniority means everything.

281
00:21:16,857 --> 00:21:21,629
If, for whatever reason, you're not
happy with me, you're on your own.

282
00:21:21,663 --> 00:21:24,833
You're free to hire your own
attorney out of your own pocket.

283
00:21:24,865 --> 00:21:28,170
Educational law isn't
exactly a common speciality.

284
00:21:28,202 --> 00:21:30,439
So what's the good news?

285
00:21:30,471 --> 00:21:34,143
I don't like to lose. And I'm
willing to fight for you.

286
00:21:35,643 --> 00:21:37,245
Are you a believer?

287
00:21:37,278 --> 00:21:41,149
You mean a Christian?
No.

288
00:21:41,182 --> 00:21:42,734
But I think
that's an advantage.

289
00:21:42,735 --> 00:21:44,286
Why?

290
00:21:44,318 --> 00:21:45,854
You're passionate
about what you believe.

291
00:21:45,886 --> 00:21:49,090
Let's face it. It's why you're
in trouble in the first place.

292
00:21:49,124 --> 00:21:51,393
But it blinds you to
the realities of procedure.

293
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:57,164
Okay.

294
00:21:57,198 --> 00:21:59,201
Okay, what?

295
00:21:59,233 --> 00:22:01,802
Okay, I agree to
let you represent me.

296
00:22:01,836 --> 00:22:03,337
Good.

297
00:22:03,371 --> 00:22:04,740
Okay.

298
00:22:10,411 --> 00:22:12,447
David, are you okay?

299
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,615
I'm terrific.

300
00:22:14,648 --> 00:22:18,486
There was a young man
in here, brilliant kid,

301
00:22:18,519 --> 00:22:22,557
with no exposure to Scripture
until a few months ago.

302
00:22:22,589 --> 00:22:25,559
Came in
with some questions.

303
00:22:25,593 --> 00:22:28,630
147 of 'em, to be exact.

304
00:22:28,663 --> 00:22:32,500
Feel like I've been hit by a
truck loaded with Bibles.

305
00:22:32,534 --> 00:22:35,837
Big heavy ones
with those thick covers.

306
00:22:38,405 --> 00:22:40,747
"Always be ready to
give answer as to why

307
00:22:40,748 --> 00:22:43,144
you believe and the
reason for your hope."

308
00:22:44,511 --> 00:22:46,847
1 Peter
chapter 3, verse 15.

309
00:22:46,881 --> 00:22:48,483
Yes.

310
00:22:48,516 --> 00:22:51,720
And where were you
four hours ago?

311
00:22:54,321 --> 00:22:59,894
"Trust in the Lord with all your heart
and lean not on your own understanding.

312
00:22:59,928 --> 00:23:02,531
In all your ways,
acknowledge him

313
00:23:02,564 --> 00:23:04,867
and will make
your path straight."

314
00:23:16,577 --> 00:23:18,346
Father, I need you.

315
00:23:19,846 --> 00:23:21,782
I can't do this alone.

316
00:23:25,653 --> 00:23:27,556
I know that you're in control.

317
00:23:30,625 --> 00:23:34,163
Please, give me the courage.

318
00:23:38,398 --> 00:23:41,602
In Jesus' name, amen.

319
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:51,512
Call to order.

320
00:23:52,779 --> 00:23:54,816
I assume
Ms. Wesley understands

321
00:23:54,848 --> 00:23:57,651
that this board has
the power to recommend

322
00:23:57,652 --> 00:23:59,520
any number of
disciplinary actions,

323
00:23:59,554 --> 00:24:00,989
up to and including
termination.

324
00:24:01,021 --> 00:24:03,524
She does.

325
00:24:03,557 --> 00:24:06,627
And this board should be aware that
in the event of such termination,

326
00:24:06,661 --> 00:24:09,660
which we would view as
wrongful and without cause,

327
00:24:09,661 --> 00:24:11,502
she reserves all
rights of redress.

328
00:24:11,503 --> 00:24:13,218
I may have a solution.

329
00:24:13,219 --> 00:24:16,638
There might be a way around
all of this unpleasantness

330
00:24:16,671 --> 00:24:18,940
that would satisfy
all parties.

331
00:24:18,972 --> 00:24:23,010
A disciplinary notice
in Ms. Wesley's file

332
00:24:23,044 --> 00:24:27,682
stating the school board's
objections to her behavior,

333
00:24:27,714 --> 00:24:30,584
a response from Ms. Wesley

334
00:24:30,617 --> 00:24:33,520
confessing
the inappropriateness of

335
00:24:33,554 --> 00:24:36,825
and apologizing
for her actions,

336
00:24:36,857 --> 00:24:39,793
along with a pledge
not to engage

337
00:24:39,826 --> 00:24:44,898
in similar discussion
of Jesus in the future.

338
00:24:44,932 --> 00:24:46,901
I'm confident that we can
move forward on that basis.

339
00:24:46,933 --> 00:24:49,303
No.

340
00:24:49,336 --> 00:24:51,272
Grace.

341
00:24:52,307 --> 00:24:53,875
I can't.

342
00:24:57,811 --> 00:25:01,448
I'd like to request a brief recess
to have a word with my client.

343
00:25:01,481 --> 00:25:02,817
Excuse me.

344
00:25:05,553 --> 00:25:09,357
Grace, this is exactly
what we were hoping for.

345
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:12,394
This is the part where you say
you're sorry, thank your lawyer,

346
00:25:12,426 --> 00:25:16,630
go back to your classroom,
pick up your life and move on.

347
00:25:16,663 --> 00:25:18,132
I can't do that.

348
00:25:18,133 --> 00:25:19,600
Why?

349
00:25:21,568 --> 00:25:24,471
I gave an honest answer to a student's
legitimate question in history.

350
00:25:24,505 --> 00:25:28,843
Grace. Grace, you
don't wanna do this.

351
00:25:28,875 --> 00:25:31,646
It's the wrong decision.

352
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:35,716
Is it?

353
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:38,787
I mean, I would rather
stand with God

354
00:25:38,819 --> 00:25:41,489
and be judged by the world

355
00:25:41,521 --> 00:25:45,660
than stand with the world
and be judged by God.

356
00:25:47,862 --> 00:25:51,066
I am not gonna be afraid
to say the name Jesus.

357
00:26:02,109 --> 00:26:04,478
I know her.
She's not gonna go for it.

358
00:26:04,511 --> 00:26:07,781
How do we make this go away
and not get blood on our hands?

359
00:26:07,815 --> 00:26:11,786
That's the easy part.
We let the ACLU do it.

360
00:26:11,818 --> 00:26:14,955
They'll file suit
against Ms. Wesley

361
00:26:14,989 --> 00:26:18,826
and if she is found liable,
which she will be,

362
00:26:18,859 --> 00:26:20,861
then we fire her
for cause.

363
00:26:20,894 --> 00:26:24,065
But the school district will
certainly be named as a codefendant.

364
00:26:24,097 --> 00:26:26,967
We don't have the financial
wherewithal to fight that.

365
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,869
They've already
been in touch.

366
00:26:28,903 --> 00:26:31,839
They aren't interested
in punishing the school.

367
00:26:31,873 --> 00:26:33,741
They want her.

368
00:26:33,775 --> 00:26:35,777
Are you sure?

369
00:26:35,809 --> 00:26:40,647
Trust me. They've been
dreaming of a case like this.

370
00:26:50,625 --> 00:26:53,939
While Ms. Wesley apologizes
for any inconvenience

371
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:55,596
her actions may have caused,

372
00:26:55,630 --> 00:26:58,533
Ms. Wesley stands by
her statements,

373
00:26:58,566 --> 00:27:02,002
and she does not retract or recant
them, either in full or in part.

374
00:27:05,972 --> 00:27:07,642
So noted.

375
00:27:11,746 --> 00:27:14,716
Having little choice,

376
00:27:14,749 --> 00:27:18,519
this board recommends continued
suspension, henceforth without pay,

377
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:21,956
pending review by a court
of competent jurisdiction

378
00:27:21,989 --> 00:27:24,125
to determine whether or not
Ms. Wesley violated

379
00:27:24,157 --> 00:27:27,861
local, state
or federal guidelines.

380
00:27:27,894 --> 00:27:30,398
This proceeding
is adjourned.

381
00:27:44,912 --> 00:27:46,851
The last thing we need
is a bunch of religious

382
00:27:46,852 --> 00:27:48,583
fanatics protesting
outside of our house.

383
00:27:48,615 --> 00:27:51,519
We'll work to keep it
out of the media for now.

384
00:27:51,551 --> 00:27:54,121
But next year, when you're
applying to all the colleges,

385
00:27:54,154 --> 00:27:56,594
you'll be able to tell
the story of how Brooke

386
00:27:56,595 --> 00:27:58,826
was part of a landmark
constitutional case

387
00:27:58,859 --> 00:28:01,195
concerning the separation
of church and state.

388
00:28:01,229 --> 00:28:05,633
And believe me, there is not
an Ivy League admissions board

389
00:28:05,665 --> 00:28:09,037
that could resist that.

390
00:28:09,069 --> 00:28:11,873
And think of the other
children out there,

391
00:28:11,905 --> 00:28:13,807
innocent children
who are subjected

392
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,543
to their repressive
belief system.

393
00:28:16,576 --> 00:28:18,946
And not forgetting
the financial opportunities.

394
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:20,582
Yes.

395
00:28:20,615 --> 00:28:23,050
Ms. Wesley is an employee
of the school board.

396
00:28:23,084 --> 00:28:27,154
We win in court and we establish her
misconduct as said paid employee,

397
00:28:27,188 --> 00:28:29,624
well, there's nothing
that changes policy faster

398
00:28:29,656 --> 00:28:33,160
than a big,
expensive settlement.

399
00:28:33,193 --> 00:28:36,663
We're going to prove
once and for all

400
00:28:36,696 --> 00:28:39,033
that God is dead.

401
00:28:46,273 --> 00:28:48,175
Brooke is a minor.

402
00:28:48,209 --> 00:28:51,913
As far as the court is
concerned, she has no rights.

403
00:28:51,945 --> 00:28:55,215
That simply means I won't be
asking her to be a witness.

404
00:28:55,249 --> 00:28:57,818
I feel supremely
confident about this.

405
00:29:05,593 --> 00:29:06,827
Okay.

406
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:21,709
Injunctive relief?

407
00:29:21,741 --> 00:29:23,084
They're asking
that you be fired,

408
00:29:23,085 --> 00:29:24,979
plus revocation of your
teaching certificate.

409
00:29:25,011 --> 00:29:27,080
What?
How am I supposed to...

410
00:29:27,114 --> 00:29:28,850
Plus attorney's fees.

411
00:29:28,883 --> 00:29:32,187
Essentially, you'II...
You'll lose everything.

412
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:35,690
Why are they doing this?

413
00:29:35,722 --> 00:29:37,959
They want to make
an example of you.

414
00:29:37,991 --> 00:29:40,295
To them, your beliefs
are like a disease

415
00:29:40,327 --> 00:29:42,230
whose time
has come and gone,

416
00:29:42,262 --> 00:29:46,201
sort of like small pox,
or polio, or the plague.

417
00:29:49,971 --> 00:29:51,539
So, what do we do?

418
00:29:53,106 --> 00:29:55,042
We win.

419
00:30:02,983 --> 00:30:04,690
Hey, what's going on?

420
00:30:04,691 --> 00:30:06,220
Brooke is exercising
her right to protest.

421
00:30:06,252 --> 00:30:07,848
Idiot.

422
00:30:07,849 --> 00:30:09,691
Hey, shut up, loser. At least
she's standing for something.

423
00:30:09,723 --> 00:30:11,759
Give me that.

424
00:30:11,791 --> 00:30:14,928
Brooke, you need to
stop this immediately.

425
00:30:14,961 --> 00:30:18,066
Brooke, this is the last
time I'm gonna tell you.

426
00:30:18,098 --> 00:30:21,168
If you don't stop this right now,
they're are gonna be some consequences.

427
00:30:21,201 --> 00:30:24,205
I don't think there will,
because this is a sidewalk,

428
00:30:24,206 --> 00:30:25,707
which is public property.

429
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,141
My dad's a lawyer.

430
00:30:27,173 --> 00:30:31,712
Well, actually, this sidewalk
is on school property.

431
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:33,992
I suggest you girls
aren't late for class.

432
00:30:33,993 --> 00:30:35,115
Yes, ma'am.

433
00:30:49,262 --> 00:30:52,366
Hey, what are you doing?

434
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,970
Just reading the paper
while my laptop

435
00:30:54,971 --> 00:30:57,672
goes through my online
jury orientation.

436
00:30:57,704 --> 00:30:59,874
Well, shouldn't you
be paying attention?

437
00:31:02,143 --> 00:31:05,113
<i>Please remember that consumption
of alcoholic beverages,</i>

438
00:31:05,145 --> 00:31:08,782
<i>non-prescription drugs and weapons
are prohibited in the courtroom.</i>

439
00:31:08,816 --> 00:31:12,286
Still, isn't it
your civic duty?

440
00:31:12,318 --> 00:31:16,356
Theoretically, yeah,
but Matthew 22:14.

441
00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:18,726
"Many are called,
few are chosen."

442
00:31:18,759 --> 00:31:20,361
Exactly.

443
00:31:20,394 --> 00:31:23,230
Three hundred people show up,
they sit around for eight hours,

444
00:31:23,263 --> 00:31:26,967
and at the end of the day they all
go home, having not been selected.

445
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,937
Statistically, I have a better
chance of being hit by lightning.

446
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,591
Gotta get some coffee.

447
00:31:33,592 --> 00:31:34,741
All right.

448
00:31:34,775 --> 00:31:37,078
It's called "voir dire."

449
00:31:37,111 --> 00:31:39,496
It means that we get a
chance to eliminate any

450
00:31:39,497 --> 00:31:41,983
potential jurors that may
have bias against you.

451
00:31:42,016 --> 00:31:43,951
Sir.

452
00:31:43,983 --> 00:31:46,086
Thank you, sir.

453
00:31:46,119 --> 00:31:48,088
-So, how are you feeling?
-I'm good.

454
00:31:48,122 --> 00:31:51,225
This is a bit of an arduous process.
They bring all these jurors in.

455
00:31:51,258 --> 00:31:54,295
It's gonna take the whole day, but
this is where we can win the case.

456
00:32:07,508 --> 00:32:10,111
All rise for the Honorable
Judge Robert Stennis.

457
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:17,751
<i>On the order of the matter of Thawley
vs. Wesley, you may be seated.</i>

458
00:32:19,353 --> 00:32:23,490
So, it says here...
What does it say?

459
00:32:23,523 --> 00:32:25,425
It says you're a psychic.

460
00:32:25,459 --> 00:32:27,228
Yes.

461
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:31,031
Do you know who's gonna win
this case? Don't answer that.

462
00:32:31,065 --> 00:32:33,334
We're going to challenge
this juror, Your Honor.

463
00:32:35,068 --> 00:32:39,406
Ms. Bailey, what's
your favorite TV show?

464
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,241
<i>Pretty Little Liars.</i>

465
00:32:43,042 --> 00:32:44,344
Peremptory challenge,
Your Honor.

466
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,750
What is your
favorite TV show?

467
00:32:48,782 --> 00:32:50,718
<i>Duck Dynasty.</i>

468
00:32:52,486 --> 00:32:54,289
Peremptory challenge,
Your Honor.

469
00:32:56,323 --> 00:32:58,526
<i>Duck Dynasty.</i>

470
00:32:58,558 --> 00:33:02,363
Mrs. Smith, are you involved in any
community or charitable organizations?

471
00:33:02,395 --> 00:33:04,231
Yes, the Salvation Army.

472
00:33:04,265 --> 00:33:06,901
We'll accept this juror,
Your Honor.

473
00:33:06,933 --> 00:33:10,538
Juror number nine.
You're a teacher.

474
00:33:10,570 --> 00:33:12,272
I'm a retired teacher.

475
00:33:12,306 --> 00:33:15,143
Ever have any disciplinary
run-ins with the administration?

476
00:33:15,175 --> 00:33:18,145
Never.

477
00:33:18,179 --> 00:33:20,848
Acceptable to the plaintiff,
Your Honor.

478
00:33:20,881 --> 00:33:22,316
Acceptable, Your Honor.

479
00:33:22,348 --> 00:33:24,317
Peremptory challenge,
Your Honor.

480
00:33:24,351 --> 00:33:25,987
We'll take her, Your Honor.

481
00:33:26,019 --> 00:33:28,088
Thank you, Mr. Cherry. Peremptive
challenge, Your Honor.

482
00:33:29,923 --> 00:33:32,559
Number two
just screams Marine.

483
00:33:32,593 --> 00:33:34,228
I don't want him.

484
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:35,896
It'll mean
blowing our last challenge.

485
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:37,498
Well, we have no choice.

486
00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:41,269
What part of "God, Country and Corps"
do you wanna put on that jury?

487
00:33:41,301 --> 00:33:44,538
What was your
last paid position?

488
00:33:44,571 --> 00:33:48,308
Artillery Forward Observer,
United States Marine Corps.

489
00:33:49,609 --> 00:33:52,346
Peremptory challenge,
Your Honor.

490
00:33:52,378 --> 00:33:54,248
Thank you.

491
00:33:57,351 --> 00:34:00,054
Your Honor, we'd like
to challenge for cause.

492
00:34:00,086 --> 00:34:01,855
Why is that?

493
00:34:01,888 --> 00:34:04,925
Your Honor, the man's an ordained
minister. Need I say more?

494
00:34:07,094 --> 00:34:09,230
The juror is excused.

495
00:34:09,262 --> 00:34:10,463
Objection,
Your Honor.

496
00:34:10,496 --> 00:34:12,048
Basis, Mr. Endler?

497
00:34:12,049 --> 00:34:13,600
Discriminatory, Your Honor.

498
00:34:13,634 --> 00:34:16,269
Peremptory challenges
cannot be used to discriminate

499
00:34:16,302 --> 00:34:18,839
against a certain class
of juror based on race,

500
00:34:18,873 --> 00:34:20,842
ethnic background,
religion or gender.

501
00:34:20,875 --> 00:34:24,028
The fact that religious
belief is tangential

502
00:34:24,029 --> 00:34:24,846
to this case doesn't
change that.

503
00:34:30,217 --> 00:34:34,021
Upon further reflection, I find the
respondent's assertion is correct.

504
00:34:34,054 --> 00:34:36,523
Sustained.

505
00:34:36,556 --> 00:34:38,225
You're not her pastor,
are you?

506
00:34:38,259 --> 00:34:40,260
No, Your Honor.

507
00:34:40,293 --> 00:34:43,129
Your Honor,
I must protest here.

508
00:34:43,163 --> 00:34:45,565
Mr. Kane, you had a set number
of peremptory challenges,

509
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:47,335
all of which you have used.

510
00:34:47,367 --> 00:34:50,170
Therefore, it's up
to opposing counsel.

511
00:34:50,204 --> 00:34:52,406
We accept him, Your Honor.

512
00:34:52,438 --> 00:34:54,274
Welcome to the jury, sir.

513
00:34:54,307 --> 00:34:57,478
Henceforth,
juror number 12.

514
00:34:57,510 --> 00:35:00,614
I hope you enjoy
your service to the community.

515
00:35:00,648 --> 00:35:03,617
Better chance of being
struck by lightning.

516
00:35:08,389 --> 00:35:11,593
<i>It amazes me how we,
as human beings, think.</i>

517
00:35:14,994 --> 00:35:17,264
<i>When I was battling
for my life,</i>

518
00:35:17,297 --> 00:35:21,601
<i>I was willing to hold on
to anything, including God,</i>

519
00:35:21,635 --> 00:35:24,973
<i>even though I really didn't
believe in him until that moment.</i>

520
00:35:26,539 --> 00:35:30,344
<i>I was convinced
that I felt him.</i>

521
00:35:30,376 --> 00:35:33,047
But now that
I'm officially in remission,

522
00:35:35,181 --> 00:35:38,051
I find myself
questioning everything.

523
00:35:38,085 --> 00:35:42,490
So, effective immediately,

524
00:35:43,623 --> 00:35:45,592
this blog is the personal diary

525
00:35:45,626 --> 00:35:48,696
of one woman's
exploration of faith

526
00:35:48,728 --> 00:35:53,134
on her own terms,
cancer-free.

527
00:36:02,643 --> 00:36:04,512
Hey, Martin.
How's it going?

528
00:36:04,545 --> 00:36:06,480
Very good,
Pastor Dave.

529
00:36:06,512 --> 00:36:08,115
Please.

530
00:36:10,985 --> 00:36:12,120
You sure?

531
00:36:15,121 --> 00:36:19,059
Well, it seems that for
every question you answered,

532
00:36:19,092 --> 00:36:21,561
three or four more
questions spring up.

533
00:36:21,594 --> 00:36:25,031
Yeah, but that's
a good thing, right?

534
00:36:25,065 --> 00:36:28,001
It's like what Einstein
said about science.

535
00:36:28,034 --> 00:36:30,603
Picture what you know
like the light of a candle.

536
00:36:30,637 --> 00:36:32,974
As the circle
of knowledge expands,

537
00:36:33,007 --> 00:36:36,277
so does the circumference
of darkness around it.

538
00:36:36,309 --> 00:36:38,478
So, I'm actually learning,

539
00:36:38,512 --> 00:36:40,748
even though
I might not feel like it.

540
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:44,117
Yes, exactly.

541
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:47,087
Well, I've been studying
the Beatitudes.

542
00:36:47,121 --> 00:36:51,258
They're very hard, one might say
impossible, to follow completely.

543
00:36:51,291 --> 00:36:54,161
Here in Luke's account,
Jesus says,

544
00:36:54,193 --> 00:36:56,730
"Do unto others as you'd
have them do unto you."

545
00:36:56,764 --> 00:36:59,233
But how is that possible?

546
00:36:59,266 --> 00:37:03,570
How can I react to the needs of
everyone else the same as my own,

547
00:37:03,603 --> 00:37:07,240
even for one day,
let alone my whole life?

548
00:37:07,273 --> 00:37:10,377
And how can I reconcile my
inability to do so with scripture?

549
00:37:11,711 --> 00:37:15,548
Yeah, those
are good questions.

550
00:37:15,581 --> 00:37:17,617
Okay, scoot over.

551
00:37:21,255 --> 00:37:24,458
-What is that, Luke?
-Yes, 6:20.

552
00:37:24,490 --> 00:37:27,527
<i>"And Jesus said
to his disciples,</i>

553
00:37:27,561 --> 00:37:29,764
<i>'You who are poor
are blessed</i>

554
00:37:29,797 --> 00:37:32,032
<i>because the kingdom of God
is yours.</i>

555
00:37:32,065 --> 00:37:34,034
<i>You who are now hungry
are blessed</i>

556
00:37:34,068 --> 00:37:35,436
<i>because you will be filled.</i>

557
00:37:35,469 --> 00:37:40,441
<i>You who now weep are blessed
because you will laugh.</i>

558
00:37:40,474 --> 00:37:43,744
<i>You are blessed when people hate
you, when they exclude you,</i>

559
00:37:43,777 --> 00:37:48,383
<i>insult you and slander your name as
evil because of the Son of Man.'"</i>

560
00:38:00,327 --> 00:38:04,065
You can't win.

561
00:38:04,097 --> 00:38:06,500
Thanks. I'll take that
under advisement.

562
00:38:06,532 --> 00:38:09,436
Come on.
You know I'm right.

563
00:38:09,469 --> 00:38:12,439
I mean, why do it? Why go
through this whole exercise?

564
00:38:12,472 --> 00:38:14,208
Here, thanks.

565
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:16,844
You know, I looked up
your history.

566
00:38:16,876 --> 00:38:19,646
You're better than this.

567
00:38:19,679 --> 00:38:22,215
You were third in your class
at Stanford Law.

568
00:38:22,248 --> 00:38:24,451
You clerked for a judge
on the Ninth Circuit.

569
00:38:24,485 --> 00:38:26,687
Why are you
slumming like this?

570
00:38:26,719 --> 00:38:29,414
I believe people that
don't do anything wrong

571
00:38:29,415 --> 00:38:30,557
shouldn't suffer at
the hands of the law.

572
00:38:31,757 --> 00:38:33,827
You know what hate is, Tom?

573
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:36,763
I'm not talking about
the fairy tale stuff.

574
00:38:36,797 --> 00:38:39,300
I mean real hate.

575
00:38:39,333 --> 00:38:43,204
I hate what people
like your client stand for

576
00:38:43,237 --> 00:38:46,539
and what they're
doing to our society.

577
00:38:46,572 --> 00:38:50,176
And Stennis does too,
even if doesn't admit it.

578
00:38:50,210 --> 00:38:51,811
The jury doesn't hate her.

579
00:38:51,844 --> 00:38:55,415
But that's the secret, Tommy.
They don't need to hate her.

580
00:38:55,449 --> 00:39:00,653
They just need to see a tiny
flaw in her, a half truth,

581
00:39:00,686 --> 00:39:03,356
a small inconsistency,
just a little bit of doubt,

582
00:39:04,557 --> 00:39:06,293
and they'll find against her.

583
00:39:08,896 --> 00:39:11,731
Nice shoes.

584
00:39:26,679 --> 00:39:28,115
You ready?

585
00:39:28,882 --> 00:39:30,918
Come on.

586
00:39:30,951 --> 00:39:36,423
Congress shall make no law respecting
an establishment of religion

587
00:39:36,456 --> 00:39:39,693
or prohibiting
the free exercise thereof.

588
00:39:39,726 --> 00:39:44,398
<i>The first half of this passage is
known as the establishment clause.</i>

589
00:39:44,431 --> 00:39:48,936
The second half is known as
the free exercise clause.

590
00:39:48,969 --> 00:39:50,771
<i>Now, there has been
an ongoing debate</i>

591
00:39:50,804 --> 00:39:53,374
<i>about what the role
of government should be,</i>

592
00:39:53,407 --> 00:39:56,343
<i>because in practice,
these two provisions</i>

593
00:39:56,376 --> 00:39:58,778
are often in conflict,

594
00:39:58,811 --> 00:40:02,750
which is what brings us
here today.

595
00:40:02,782 --> 00:40:05,652
<i>In the matter of
Thawley vs. Wesley,</i>

596
00:40:05,686 --> 00:40:07,855
is the plaintiff prepared to
make its opening statement?

597
00:40:07,887 --> 00:40:09,722
We are, Your Honor.

598
00:40:09,755 --> 00:40:11,925
Then proceed.

599
00:40:11,958 --> 00:40:15,528
Ladies and gentlemen,
in a jury of this size,

600
00:40:15,561 --> 00:40:21,301
I'm imagining that there are
probably among your ranks

601
00:40:21,335 --> 00:40:22,802
a few Christians.

602
00:40:22,835 --> 00:40:26,406
Hopefully practicing ones.

603
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:28,775
And that's a good thing,
that's fine,

604
00:40:28,809 --> 00:40:31,812
because Christianity
is not on trial here,

605
00:40:31,844 --> 00:40:36,449
even though my opponent will
try to convince you that it is.

606
00:40:37,751 --> 00:40:40,888
Nor is faith on trial.

607
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:47,594
Only Ms. Wesley
is on trial here today.

608
00:40:47,628 --> 00:40:50,664
Now, ask any fourth-grader

609
00:40:50,697 --> 00:40:53,834
and they're probably
familiar with the phrase,

610
00:40:53,867 --> 00:40:57,805
"Separation
of church and state,"

611
00:40:57,838 --> 00:41:02,343
and that is guaranteed
to us under our laws.

612
00:41:02,376 --> 00:41:06,780
The plaintiffs are the parents of
a student in Ms. Wesley's class

613
00:41:06,813 --> 00:41:13,019
who was subjected to hearing
the teachings of Jesus Christ

614
00:41:13,052 --> 00:41:16,690
being favorably compared to the
teachings of Mahatma Gandhi.

615
00:41:16,722 --> 00:41:22,362
We all know that Jesus is part of
a particular religious tradition.

616
00:41:24,398 --> 00:41:28,369
These parents, who are trying to raise
their daughter to be a free thinker,

617
00:41:28,402 --> 00:41:31,005
free of any religious dogma,

618
00:41:31,038 --> 00:41:35,541
are wholly offended by what
went on in that classroom.

619
00:41:35,574 --> 00:41:41,381
And she, reciting the words that
were allegedly attributed to Jesus,

620
00:41:41,414 --> 00:41:44,951
who allegedly lived
2,000 years ago,

621
00:41:44,985 --> 00:41:50,557
gave a clear
and compelling indication

622
00:41:50,590 --> 00:41:53,394
of what she believes,

623
00:41:53,427 --> 00:41:55,896
what she supports,

624
00:41:55,929 --> 00:41:57,965
what she endorses.

625
00:41:57,998 --> 00:42:00,567
Now, let me put it this way.

626
00:42:00,599 --> 00:42:04,003
I don't mean to offend anyone
who may be a Muslim here,

627
00:42:04,036 --> 00:42:07,006
and I do not want to slight
the prophet of Islam,

628
00:42:07,039 --> 00:42:11,023
but if you were to ask me a
question concerning the Koran,

629
00:42:11,024 --> 00:42:12,846
the sacred text of Islam,

630
00:42:12,878 --> 00:42:17,384
and I could come up with the answer
with great speed and accuracy,

631
00:42:17,416 --> 00:42:21,387
and I could quote
the proper sura, or chapter,

632
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:26,726
then it would be reasonable
for you to infer

633
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:32,733
that I was not only
a follower of Islam,

634
00:42:32,766 --> 00:42:35,769
but that I considered it
to be superior

635
00:42:35,802 --> 00:42:38,372
to all other forms
of religion.

636
00:42:38,405 --> 00:42:44,545
If I did this in a house of
worship, that would be fine.

637
00:42:44,577 --> 00:42:49,483
But if I did it in an 11th-grade
classroom in a public school,

638
00:42:49,516 --> 00:42:53,753
that would be preaching,
not teaching.

639
00:42:53,786 --> 00:42:56,856
So why in the world
are we here today?

640
00:42:56,889 --> 00:43:01,094
Why? Because Ms. Wesley
refused to apologize.

641
00:43:01,128 --> 00:43:06,633
And that means that her true motivation
in that moment in her classroom

642
00:43:06,666 --> 00:43:10,604
was to take
an innocent question

643
00:43:10,637 --> 00:43:13,541
and turn it into
an opportunity to preach,

644
00:43:15,474 --> 00:43:17,577
not teach.

645
00:43:17,610 --> 00:43:23,516
If we grant Ms. Wesley
the right to do that,

646
00:43:23,550 --> 00:43:26,153
and by extension,
everyone else,

647
00:43:26,186 --> 00:43:30,658
to violate the law based solely
on our own private beliefs,

648
00:43:32,858 --> 00:43:34,694
then our society will crumble.

649
00:43:36,596 --> 00:43:38,065
I believe that.

650
00:43:38,097 --> 00:43:42,503
So I implore you, please
do not set this precedent.

651
00:43:43,637 --> 00:43:45,472
Do not.

652
00:43:45,505 --> 00:43:48,075
The future of our republic
depends on it.

653
00:44:03,722 --> 00:44:05,642
<i>What's going on?</i>

654
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:07,561
<i>Brooke is exercising
her right to protest.</i>

655
00:44:07,594 --> 00:44:10,664
<i>Brooke, I need you
to stop this immediately.</i>

656
00:44:10,697 --> 00:44:13,066
<i>Brooke, this is the last time
I'm gonna tell you.</i>

657
00:44:13,099 --> 00:44:16,003
<i>If you don't stop right now,
there are gonna be consequences.</i>

658
00:44:18,137 --> 00:44:20,039
<i>-Hey, Aunt Amy.
-Hey, Marlene.</i>

659
00:44:20,072 --> 00:44:22,074
Yeah, I just saw the video.
What's going on?

660
00:44:22,108 --> 00:44:23,293
Remember my friend,
Brooke?

661
00:44:23,294 --> 00:44:24,478
<i>Yeah.</i>

662
00:44:24,510 --> 00:44:27,447
Well, she got a teacher in trouble
for asking her about Jesus.

663
00:44:27,481 --> 00:44:30,751
What? -She's not even
supposed to talk about it.

664
00:44:30,784 --> 00:44:33,119
And we can't even cover it
in our school paper.

665
00:44:33,152 --> 00:44:35,488
Is there any way
I could meet with her?

666
00:44:35,521 --> 00:44:38,925
-The teacher?
-No. Brooke.

667
00:44:41,594 --> 00:44:44,030
Mr. Endler,
your opening statement.

668
00:44:46,132 --> 00:44:48,601
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

669
00:44:48,635 --> 00:44:50,971
I have here a copy
of the Constitution

670
00:44:51,003 --> 00:44:52,940
of the United States
of America

671
00:44:52,972 --> 00:44:54,740
and its Bill of Rights,

672
00:44:54,773 --> 00:44:57,176
arguably the two
most important documents

673
00:44:57,210 --> 00:44:59,813
in the history
of our great nation.

674
00:44:59,846 --> 00:45:03,784
But despite Mr. Kane's
impassioned rhetoric,

675
00:45:03,817 --> 00:45:07,588
you know what you won't find in
there, no matter how hard you look?

676
00:45:07,621 --> 00:45:13,026
The phrase "Separation
of church and state."

677
00:45:13,059 --> 00:45:15,229
That's right.

678
00:45:15,262 --> 00:45:17,831
It's not in there.
Never has been.

679
00:45:17,864 --> 00:45:22,235
Because that phrase comes from a
letter written by Thomas Jefferson.

680
00:45:22,268 --> 00:45:26,105
Now, ironically, Jefferson was
writing to a Baptist congregation,

681
00:45:26,139 --> 00:45:28,154
ensuring them that
they would always

682
00:45:28,155 --> 00:45:29,643
have the right to
believe as they wished,

683
00:45:29,675 --> 00:45:32,645
free of government
interference.

684
00:45:32,679 --> 00:45:36,250
But lately, that phrase has
been taken out of context

685
00:45:36,282 --> 00:45:40,853
and twisted and contorted
to mean the exact opposite.

686
00:45:40,887 --> 00:45:44,958
One morning early this year, my client,
Ms. Wesley, she woke up as usual,

687
00:45:44,990 --> 00:45:48,195
she drove to work
at her job as a teacher

688
00:45:48,228 --> 00:45:49,996
at Martin Luther King
High School,

689
00:45:50,030 --> 00:45:52,199
a place where she was
Teacher of the Year.

690
00:45:52,231 --> 00:45:56,836
Her lesson plan for second-period
AP History that morning,

691
00:45:56,869 --> 00:45:59,572
it didn't include
any mention of God or Jesus.

692
00:45:59,606 --> 00:46:03,277
She didn't have a Bible sitting
on her desk in plain view.

693
00:46:03,309 --> 00:46:05,679
She didn't start her class
with a blessing.

694
00:46:05,711 --> 00:46:07,280
She didn't lead
her students in prayer.

695
00:46:07,313 --> 00:46:12,853
No, all she did was
answer a question.

696
00:46:12,885 --> 00:46:16,989
Because that is what
she gets paid to do.

697
00:46:17,023 --> 00:46:19,626
Now, Mr. Kane will insist
loudly and often

698
00:46:19,659 --> 00:46:21,662
that faith isn't
on trial here.

699
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:24,631
But that is exactly
what is on trial...

700
00:46:24,664 --> 00:46:27,834
The most basic human right of
all, the right to believe.

701
00:46:27,867 --> 00:46:30,137
Mr. Kane's afraid.

702
00:46:31,304 --> 00:46:34,074
He's afraid that you,
the jury,

703
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:37,978
the touchstone
of common sense,

704
00:46:38,010 --> 00:46:42,916
might not agree with his tortured
interpretation of the Constitution,

705
00:46:42,949 --> 00:46:46,219
that you might understand
that my client has rights,

706
00:46:46,251 --> 00:46:48,889
rights
that trump his agenda,

707
00:46:48,922 --> 00:46:50,923
and that
in realizing that

708
00:46:50,956 --> 00:46:53,659
you will hold as I do

709
00:46:53,693 --> 00:46:56,063
that my client is guilty
of no wrongdoing

710
00:46:56,096 --> 00:47:00,300
and innocent of any
and all claims against her.

711
00:47:02,402 --> 00:47:03,836
Thank you very much.

712
00:47:13,112 --> 00:47:15,014
And now it's become
this huge deal,

713
00:47:15,047 --> 00:47:18,150
and all she did was
answer my question.

714
00:47:18,184 --> 00:47:21,088
Why do you think your
parents are doing this?

715
00:47:21,121 --> 00:47:25,025
Because my mom thinks it'll help me
get into Stanford or one of the Ivys,

716
00:47:25,057 --> 00:47:28,394
and my dad thinks
it'll help pay for it.

717
00:47:28,427 --> 00:47:30,179
And nobody's asked you
what you think?

718
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:31,931
No.

719
00:47:31,965 --> 00:47:34,835
So, are you
gonna help her?

720
00:47:36,769 --> 00:47:38,072
I don't know.

721
00:47:39,239 --> 00:47:42,074
I would at least
like to talk to her.

722
00:47:42,108 --> 00:47:44,778
Maybe I could help
get her story out there.

723
00:47:44,811 --> 00:47:47,847
Great, because everyone's
telling me to stay out of it.

724
00:47:49,949 --> 00:47:52,219
Do you always do
what you're told?

725
00:47:53,753 --> 00:47:55,956
What is your heart
telling you to do?

726
00:47:59,092 --> 00:48:01,052
Mr. Thawley, how
did you feel when you

727
00:48:01,053 --> 00:48:03,363
found out that your
daughter had been exposed

728
00:48:03,396 --> 00:48:06,700
to faith-based teachings
in class?

729
00:48:06,733 --> 00:48:08,301
It felt like
we had been violated.

730
00:48:08,333 --> 00:48:11,971
This was supposed to be a history
class, not Sunday school.

731
00:48:12,005 --> 00:48:14,041
My wife and I
are free thinkers.

732
00:48:14,074 --> 00:48:16,777
We're rationalists. We believe
in a nontheistic worldview.

733
00:48:16,809 --> 00:48:19,378
That's how we were trying
to raise our daughter.

734
00:48:19,411 --> 00:48:22,381
And did you discuss this
incident with your daughter?

735
00:48:22,414 --> 00:48:24,705
Well, I tried, but
it's hard discussing

736
00:48:24,706 --> 00:48:27,054
anything with kids
that age... she's 16.

737
00:48:27,086 --> 00:48:29,789
Some of you know
what that's like.

738
00:48:29,822 --> 00:48:32,725
It's hard enough trying to
maintain credibility as a parent

739
00:48:32,759 --> 00:48:35,394
without a teacher jumping in and
arguing against your position.

740
00:48:35,427 --> 00:48:37,797
We trust the school
not to overstep its bounds

741
00:48:37,831 --> 00:48:40,901
in terms of what is
and what isn't appropriate.

742
00:48:40,934 --> 00:48:43,320
Is that too much to ask?

743
00:48:43,321 --> 00:48:45,706
No. Thank you, Mr. Thawley.
That's all, Your Honor.

744
00:48:45,739 --> 00:48:48,108
Your witness, Mr. Endler.

745
00:48:48,141 --> 00:48:49,876
No questions,
Your Honor.

746
00:48:49,909 --> 00:48:52,378
Next witness, Mr. Kane.

747
00:48:52,411 --> 00:48:56,348
Mrs. Rizzo,
did Ms. Wesley

748
00:48:56,382 --> 00:48:59,286
talk about faith issues
on the school campus?

749
00:48:59,318 --> 00:49:00,987
All the time.

750
00:49:01,019 --> 00:49:03,255
Everybody knows
she's a Christian.

751
00:49:03,289 --> 00:49:05,992
I don't think she'd chew a stick
of gum without praying first.

752
00:49:06,025 --> 00:49:07,477
It makes everyone
feel awkward.

753
00:49:07,478 --> 00:49:08,929
Thank you.

754
00:49:08,961 --> 00:49:11,498
No further questions,
Your Honor.

755
00:49:11,530 --> 00:49:14,101
Your witness,
Mr. Endler.

756
00:49:16,268 --> 00:49:21,507
Mrs. Rizzo, you stated that Ms. Wesley
talks about her faith all the time.

757
00:49:21,541 --> 00:49:25,846
I'm curious. Can you
give me a specific instance?

758
00:49:25,878 --> 00:49:29,048
Well, not off
the top of my head.

759
00:49:29,081 --> 00:49:32,318
Well, has she, as far as you're aware,
ever started her class with a prayer?

760
00:49:32,351 --> 00:49:34,221
No.

761
00:49:34,253 --> 00:49:37,523
Has she ever asked anyone in the
teacher's lounge to pray with her?

762
00:49:37,556 --> 00:49:39,458
No.

763
00:49:39,492 --> 00:49:42,195
Has she ever asked you personally
to pray with her? -Objection.

764
00:49:42,228 --> 00:49:44,764
-No.
-Cumulative.

765
00:49:44,797 --> 00:49:47,466
The question has effectively
been asked and answered.

766
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:50,003
Your Honor, Mrs. Rizzo's
sworn testimony states

767
00:49:50,036 --> 00:49:52,539
that Ms. Wesley talked
about her faith all the time,

768
00:49:52,572 --> 00:49:54,508
yet she's failed to cite
a single instance.

769
00:49:54,541 --> 00:49:58,144
I'm merely trying to discover
some basis for her opinion.

770
00:49:58,177 --> 00:50:01,347
Sustained. Mr. Endler, we're done
with this line of questioning.

771
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:05,117
Mrs. Rizzo, in the school's
initial inquiry into this matter,

772
00:50:05,150 --> 00:50:06,519
you were Ms. Wesley's
representative

773
00:50:06,552 --> 00:50:08,454
on behalf of the teacher's
union, were you not?

774
00:50:08,487 --> 00:50:10,556
Yes.

775
00:50:10,590 --> 00:50:13,794
And did you ever consider that
your disapproval of her faith

776
00:50:13,827 --> 00:50:15,529
might taint your ability
to represent her properly?

777
00:50:15,561 --> 00:50:18,030
-Objection, speculative.
-Sustained.

778
00:50:18,063 --> 00:50:21,167
God bless you.

779
00:50:21,201 --> 00:50:23,235
Careful, or you
might end up on trial.

780
00:50:23,268 --> 00:50:26,138
Mr. Endler!

781
00:50:26,172 --> 00:50:28,340
No further questions,
Your Honor.

782
00:50:31,610 --> 00:50:34,246
<i>So, when are these
religious zealots</i>

783
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:36,746
<i>going to realize it's
not only disrespectful</i>

784
00:50:36,747 --> 00:50:38,852
<i>of them to push their
beliefs on others,</i>

785
00:50:38,885 --> 00:50:41,421
<i>in this case
it's actually illegal?</i>

786
00:50:41,454 --> 00:50:44,324
<i>This woman, this fundamentalist,</i>

787
00:50:44,356 --> 00:50:46,458
<i>used her position
of influence as a teacher</i>

788
00:50:46,492 --> 00:50:49,496
<i>to fill the minds of our
children with nonsense.</i>

789
00:50:49,528 --> 00:50:52,865
<i>If you ask me, the religious
extremists we need to worry about</i>

790
00:50:52,898 --> 00:50:55,000
<i>are the hard-core Christians.</i>

791
00:50:55,034 --> 00:50:57,903
<i>How about we show up in force
and show Ms. Wesley</i>

792
00:50:57,936 --> 00:51:00,507
<i>just exactly what we think
of her proselytizing?</i>

793
00:51:00,539 --> 00:51:02,275
Principal Kinney,

794
00:51:02,307 --> 00:51:05,846
what was the school district's
final determination?

795
00:51:05,878 --> 00:51:09,181
Well, Grace has been
suspended without pay

796
00:51:09,215 --> 00:51:11,151
pending the results
of this trial.

797
00:51:11,184 --> 00:51:13,887
Isn't it rather unusual,
leaving it up to a third party

798
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:17,523
to determine whether
Ms. Wesley is fired?

799
00:51:17,556 --> 00:51:19,569
We've decided to
accept the court's

800
00:51:19,570 --> 00:51:21,861
interpretation of
wrongdoing either way.

801
00:51:21,894 --> 00:51:23,563
No questions, Your Honor.

802
00:51:23,596 --> 00:51:25,331
Your witness, Mr. Endler.

803
00:51:25,364 --> 00:51:28,067
Ms. Kinney,
can you tell me

804
00:51:28,101 --> 00:51:30,604
the full name of the high school
over which you preside?

805
00:51:30,637 --> 00:51:34,240
Dr. Martin Luther King Junior
Memorial High School.

806
00:51:34,273 --> 00:51:36,442
I noticed that the name
fails to mention

807
00:51:36,476 --> 00:51:39,012
Dr. King's title
as Reverend Doctor.

808
00:51:39,045 --> 00:51:43,416
It's his work in the field of civil
rights that we prefer to highlight.

809
00:51:43,449 --> 00:51:45,117
But that's the whole point.

810
00:51:45,150 --> 00:51:47,152
You consider
his faith and politics

811
00:51:47,186 --> 00:51:48,655
to be separate things.

812
00:51:48,688 --> 00:51:51,657
But I don't,
and certainly wouldn't have.

813
00:51:51,690 --> 00:51:54,994
Objection, Your Honor.
Counsel is testifying.

814
00:51:55,027 --> 00:51:56,663
Sustained.

815
00:51:56,695 --> 00:52:01,134
Jury's instructed to ignore
Mr. Endler's preceding remarks.

816
00:52:01,166 --> 00:52:05,070
Ms. Kinney, are you familiar with Dr.
King's letter from the Birmingham jail?

817
00:52:05,103 --> 00:52:08,107
Yes, it's a seminal piece
of civil rights history.

818
00:52:08,141 --> 00:52:12,278
In that letter Dr. King makes numerous
faith-based references, does not?

819
00:52:12,311 --> 00:52:14,614
Offhand,
I don't recall.

820
00:52:14,646 --> 00:52:17,083
Allow me to refresh
your memory.

821
00:52:19,686 --> 00:52:24,090
Cites the example of the three
youths from the book of Daniel

822
00:52:24,123 --> 00:52:27,260
who were tossed into the fiery
furnace by King Nebuchadnezzar

823
00:52:27,293 --> 00:52:29,229
because they refused
to worship him.

824
00:52:29,262 --> 00:52:32,231
Elsewhere, urges
action with Jesus,

825
00:52:32,264 --> 00:52:34,600
and here I quote,
"Extremist love."

826
00:52:34,634 --> 00:52:37,036
And in his speech,
"I've Been to the Mountaintop,"

827
00:52:37,070 --> 00:52:39,338
stated that just
wanted to do God's will.

828
00:52:39,371 --> 00:52:41,373
Is this coming back
to you now?

829
00:52:41,407 --> 00:52:43,943
Yes.

830
00:52:43,976 --> 00:52:46,413
In your opinion, would Ms.
Wesley, had she chosen to do so,

831
00:52:46,445 --> 00:52:48,044
have been allowed to
present the examples

832
00:52:48,045 --> 00:52:49,415
that I just mentioned
in her class?

833
00:52:49,449 --> 00:52:52,485
-Objection. Speculative.
-I'm going to allow it.

834
00:52:52,518 --> 00:52:54,320
Overruled.
Witness may answer.

835
00:52:57,123 --> 00:53:00,327
No. If it were up to me,
she would not have been allowed.

836
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:02,528
Why not?

837
00:53:02,561 --> 00:53:05,699
Because those examples are too
closely associated with faith.

838
00:53:05,731 --> 00:53:07,733
In other words,
they're facts,

839
00:53:07,766 --> 00:53:11,003
but they're just facts that are
too dangerous for discussion?

840
00:53:11,036 --> 00:53:14,406
The word I would use
would be "controversial."

841
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:16,976
But aren't facts just facts?

842
00:53:17,010 --> 00:53:21,314
I mean, there's nothing controversial
about two plus two equaling four,

843
00:53:21,347 --> 00:53:23,550
or E equals MC squared,

844
00:53:23,583 --> 00:53:25,485
or the date
man landed on the moon.

845
00:53:25,518 --> 00:53:27,987
So why the controversy
about these facts?

846
00:53:28,021 --> 00:53:31,191
I think the fact that we're all
here today speaks for itself.

847
00:53:34,793 --> 00:53:37,196
Thank you for your honesty.

848
00:53:38,630 --> 00:53:41,367
One last question.

849
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:44,036
In your orientation at the
beginning of the semester,

850
00:53:44,070 --> 00:53:48,976
your memo to the staff stressed
diversity and tolerance, did it not?

851
00:53:49,708 --> 00:53:51,477
Yes.

852
00:53:51,510 --> 00:53:55,181
Well, would it be fair to say
that except for Christianity,

853
00:53:55,213 --> 00:53:57,483
all other forms of diversity
are welcome?

854
00:53:57,516 --> 00:54:00,686
-Objection! Your Honor!
-I will withdraw the question.

855
00:54:00,719 --> 00:54:03,489
Mr. Endler, you seem
to have a penchant

856
00:54:03,523 --> 00:54:06,059
for injecting commentary
where it doesn't belong.

857
00:54:06,092 --> 00:54:09,796
You would do well to avoid further
provocation of this court.

858
00:54:09,829 --> 00:54:12,499
I apologize, Your Honor.

859
00:54:12,532 --> 00:54:15,068
I'll look to curtail it
in the future.

860
00:54:17,269 --> 00:54:19,172
Redirect, Your Honor?

861
00:54:20,639 --> 00:54:24,210
Ms. Kinney,
I understand

862
00:54:24,242 --> 00:54:28,347
that you attended a service at Ms.
Wesley's church a short while ago.

863
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:31,183
-Is that correct?
-Yes, that's correct.

864
00:54:31,217 --> 00:54:33,438
It was an event honoring
several students who

865
00:54:33,439 --> 00:54:35,755
attend that church for
their community service.

866
00:54:35,788 --> 00:54:40,092
And who was it that
invited you to that service?

867
00:54:40,126 --> 00:54:41,461
Grace Wesley.

868
00:54:41,462 --> 00:54:42,796
I see.

869
00:54:42,829 --> 00:54:45,565
And where were you when this
invitation was extended?

870
00:54:45,597 --> 00:54:47,833
At my office.

871
00:54:47,867 --> 00:54:49,152
On school grounds?

872
00:54:49,153 --> 00:54:50,437
Yes.

873
00:54:50,469 --> 00:54:52,438
During work hours?

874
00:54:53,672 --> 00:54:55,207
Yes.

875
00:54:56,641 --> 00:54:58,344
Thank you.

876
00:55:00,746 --> 00:55:02,715
One last question.

877
00:55:02,748 --> 00:55:06,786
Is it true that Ms.
Wesley accepts donations

878
00:55:06,818 --> 00:55:12,257
for a faith-based charity,
Convoy of Hope,

879
00:55:12,291 --> 00:55:13,626
right there
in the classroom?

880
00:55:15,260 --> 00:55:16,795
Yes, she does.

881
00:55:16,829 --> 00:55:19,164
Thank you again.

882
00:55:19,197 --> 00:55:20,533
No further questions,
Your Honor.

883
00:55:25,371 --> 00:55:27,773
You may step down,
Mrs. Kinney.

884
00:55:27,806 --> 00:55:29,542
Court's adjourned.

885
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:37,584
Grace, can I ask you
a question,

886
00:55:37,617 --> 00:55:39,119
off the record?

887
00:55:40,253 --> 00:55:41,688
Sure.

888
00:55:41,721 --> 00:55:43,822
These people, they're
looking to destroy you,

889
00:55:43,856 --> 00:55:46,159
and I don't just mean
financially.

890
00:55:47,559 --> 00:55:49,429
Do you think
it's worth it?

891
00:55:51,797 --> 00:55:54,233
I hope so.

892
00:55:56,768 --> 00:55:58,370
So do I.

893
00:56:14,753 --> 00:56:18,157
Fishy and cheesy at the same time.
This tuna melt is exquisite.

894
00:56:18,190 --> 00:56:20,326
Yeah, exquisite.

895
00:56:20,358 --> 00:56:23,262
It's the provolone.
That was my idea.

896
00:56:23,295 --> 00:56:26,398
I love what it does
to the flavor of the fish.

897
00:56:26,431 --> 00:56:27,533
Don't I know you?

898
00:56:27,567 --> 00:56:29,536
You're from
Blaze's Car Rental, right?

899
00:56:29,568 --> 00:56:32,204
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

900
00:56:32,237 --> 00:56:34,640
Yeah, that gig didn't
really work out for me.

901
00:56:34,673 --> 00:56:37,277
I don't think customer
service is my forte.

902
00:56:37,309 --> 00:56:39,211
So you decided
to become a waiter?

903
00:56:39,244 --> 00:56:40,913
This is where
I do dinner theater.

904
00:56:40,947 --> 00:56:43,182
In the mornings
I serve up croissants.

905
00:56:43,215 --> 00:56:44,951
In the evenings
I serve up Chekhov.

906
00:56:46,652 --> 00:56:51,291
Hey, listen, sorry about
the whole car-not-working thing.

907
00:56:51,324 --> 00:56:53,659
It's okay.
I learned my lesson.

908
00:56:53,693 --> 00:56:55,361
Bought a Prius.

909
00:56:55,393 --> 00:56:57,863
Starts every time.

910
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:03,603
-Same guy.
-Same guy.

911
00:57:03,635 --> 00:57:05,672
Amazing.

912
00:57:05,704 --> 00:57:11,344
Gentlemen, I don't want
to spoil your brunch,

913
00:57:11,376 --> 00:57:15,547
but I'm hearing from a friend of
mine in the prosecutor's office

914
00:57:15,581 --> 00:57:19,219
about a subpoena
that just came down

915
00:57:19,251 --> 00:57:24,257
demanding that we submit copies of our
sermons for the last three months

916
00:57:25,391 --> 00:57:27,726
for review.

917
00:57:29,527 --> 00:57:31,463
Can they do that?

918
00:57:31,496 --> 00:57:33,732
They tried it in Houston.

919
00:57:33,766 --> 00:57:35,668
So now the government
can determine what

920
00:57:35,669 --> 00:57:37,570
we can and can't
preach at our churches?

921
00:57:37,603 --> 00:57:40,773
Let's not overreact. I'm sure
there's no ill intent here.

922
00:57:40,806 --> 00:57:44,777
Unfortunately, I think
this is just the beginning.

923
00:57:44,809 --> 00:57:48,547
We've been ignoring it, and now
we're paying the price for it.

924
00:57:50,349 --> 00:57:53,452
Well, don't forget the silent
majority. They're out there.

925
00:57:53,485 --> 00:57:55,754
They just need something
to stand for.

926
00:57:55,788 --> 00:57:57,789
I'll admit
there's pressure,

927
00:57:57,822 --> 00:58:00,492
but I think with time
this will correct itself.

928
00:58:00,525 --> 00:58:03,562
Forgive me,
but I think you're wrong.

929
00:58:03,596 --> 00:58:07,567
I'm serving on a jury in a case right
now that touches on these issues.

930
00:58:07,599 --> 00:58:10,002
Of course, I'm not allowed
to talk about it,

931
00:58:10,036 --> 00:58:12,838
but the one thing
that it's convinced me

932
00:58:12,839 --> 00:58:15,708
of is that if we stand
by and do nothing,

933
00:58:15,740 --> 00:58:18,610
pressure we're feeling today is
gonna mean persecution tomorrow.

934
00:58:18,643 --> 00:58:21,613
What makes you so sure?

935
00:58:21,646 --> 00:58:24,384
Speed of change,
viciousness of the opposition.

936
00:58:26,751 --> 00:58:28,856
The message of the gospel
has us standing in the

937
00:58:28,857 --> 00:58:30,789
way of a lot of things
powerful people want,

938
00:58:30,822 --> 00:58:33,759
and our resistance
to change that message,

939
00:58:33,793 --> 00:58:37,329
because it's not ours to change,
has made us a lot of enemies.

940
00:58:37,362 --> 00:58:40,032
Whether we admit it or not,
we're at war,

941
00:58:40,065 --> 00:58:43,001
the war of Ephesians 6,
not against flesh and blood,

942
00:58:43,034 --> 00:58:45,404
but against the powers
of this world,

943
00:58:45,438 --> 00:58:48,740
against the spiritual forces
in the heavenly realms.

944
00:58:48,773 --> 00:58:51,577
And if we insist
on denying that,

945
00:58:53,945 --> 00:58:55,848
then we've already lost.

946
00:59:09,728 --> 00:59:11,697
Brought a giant bag
of Chinese food

947
00:59:11,731 --> 00:59:13,599
and a briefcase
full of files.

948
00:59:13,632 --> 00:59:15,835
I say we eat first.

949
00:59:15,867 --> 00:59:18,570
I say
you're a genius.

950
00:59:18,603 --> 00:59:22,107
-Does Walter want to join us?
-No. He's hiding in his room.

951
00:59:22,141 --> 00:59:24,010
How come?

952
00:59:24,043 --> 00:59:27,480
He's treating this
like it's a date,

953
00:59:27,512 --> 00:59:30,782
which should give you some indication
of what my social life is like.

954
00:59:30,815 --> 00:59:32,584
Don't worry.
I won't tell.

955
00:59:32,617 --> 00:59:35,454
Falls under
attorney-client privilege.

956
00:59:35,487 --> 00:59:38,623
So, is this what you always saw
yourself doing, the lawyer thing?

957
00:59:38,657 --> 00:59:41,928
No...
I wanted to be Batman.

958
00:59:44,028 --> 00:59:47,934
How 'bout you? Your parents have
you all set to go to the convent?

959
00:59:47,967 --> 00:59:51,371
Actually, there were no bedtime
prayers in my childhood.

960
00:59:51,403 --> 00:59:53,472
I was raised in a house
without much faith.

961
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:56,809
When did you decide
to become a Christian?

962
00:59:58,010 --> 01:00:00,680
I was walking home
from class.

963
01:00:00,713 --> 01:00:05,752
It was dark, and I was
struggling with a lot of things.

964
01:00:06,851 --> 01:00:08,788
And I turned the corner,

965
01:00:08,820 --> 01:00:10,956
and right there in front
of me was this church.

966
01:00:10,989 --> 01:00:12,991
It had this old sign
out front,

967
01:00:13,025 --> 01:00:16,061
but it just stopped me
in my tracks.

968
01:00:16,094 --> 01:00:17,763
And the sign...

969
01:00:19,597 --> 01:00:21,067
the sign said,

970
01:00:22,434 --> 01:00:24,137
"Who do you say
that I am?"

971
01:00:26,672 --> 01:00:30,943
And as I read it, I could
hear the Lord speak to me.

972
01:00:36,815 --> 01:00:41,186
You know, I couldn't get that
question out of my head for days.

973
01:00:41,219 --> 01:00:43,989
So that was the start of a
journey that didn't end

974
01:00:44,023 --> 01:00:46,393
until I found
the answer.

975
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:09,322
That was beautiful.

976
01:05:11,023 --> 01:05:14,927
Forgive me, but I did not
know anyone was here.

977
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:17,396
No.
Please don't apologize.

978
01:05:17,429 --> 01:05:20,231
I didn't mean
to interrupt.

979
01:05:20,264 --> 01:05:23,969
I just didn't know
where else to go.

980
01:05:26,137 --> 01:05:28,074
-I'm Martin.
-I'm Brooke.

981
01:05:30,309 --> 01:05:33,346
Do you think I could ask
you a few questions?

982
01:05:37,983 --> 01:05:40,019
That would be fine.

983
01:05:40,052 --> 01:05:42,454
Good,
'cause I have a lot.

984
01:05:50,027 --> 01:05:51,463
Doesn't make mistakes.

985
01:05:53,264 --> 01:05:56,067
But I thought you proved bias.
Principal Kinney and Mrs. Rizzo?

986
01:05:56,101 --> 01:05:57,836
Those were just jabs.

987
01:05:57,869 --> 01:06:01,106
We need a knockout punch.

988
01:06:01,139 --> 01:06:04,309
Why did you feel compelled to
bring Jesus up in history class?

989
01:06:06,978 --> 01:06:09,013
Why shouldn't I have?

990
01:06:09,047 --> 01:06:11,817
Grace, I'm not here to debate with you
what you think your rights were...

991
01:06:11,849 --> 01:06:15,487
No, Tom, listen.

992
01:06:15,521 --> 01:06:17,856
This isn't about faith.

993
01:06:17,889 --> 01:06:20,092
This is about history.

994
01:06:20,125 --> 01:06:22,894
Okay, maybe I'm wrong here.
I'm not the law expert.

995
01:06:22,927 --> 01:06:25,964
But I think they've
missed the point.

996
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:29,135
I'm not sure I follow.

997
01:06:29,168 --> 01:06:31,971
Their whole attack, it's
about me preaching in class,

998
01:06:32,003 --> 01:06:33,772
but I didn't do that.

999
01:06:33,806 --> 01:06:37,108
They're saying you did.
You cited scripture.

1000
01:06:37,141 --> 01:06:39,150
You talked about
Jesus' teachings just

1001
01:06:39,151 --> 01:06:41,313
like they were any
other verifiable fact.

1002
01:06:42,914 --> 01:06:44,550
But what if
they're just that?

1003
01:06:44,583 --> 01:06:47,452
Just because certain facts happen
to be recorded in the Bible

1004
01:06:47,485 --> 01:06:50,121
doesn't mean
they stop being facts.

1005
01:06:50,155 --> 01:06:53,259
We can separate the history-based
elements of Jesus' life

1006
01:06:53,291 --> 01:06:55,360
from the faith-based
element.

1007
01:06:55,393 --> 01:07:00,298
I mean, in my classroom I didn't talk
about Jesus as my Lord and Savior.

1008
01:07:00,331 --> 01:07:04,135
All I did was comment on quotations
attributed to Jesus, the man,

1009
01:07:04,168 --> 01:07:06,237
and I did it
in AP History.

1010
01:07:06,271 --> 01:07:08,007
There was nothing wrong
with the context.

1011
01:07:08,039 --> 01:07:10,342
And any rule saying
that you can talk about

1012
01:07:10,375 --> 01:07:14,914
<i>any historic figure that ever existed
except Jesus is discriminatory.</i>

1013
01:07:14,947 --> 01:07:16,448
They can't institute that.

1014
01:07:16,481 --> 01:07:19,151
And every credible historian
admits that Jesus existed.

1015
01:07:19,184 --> 01:07:21,053
There's just
too much evidence.

1016
01:07:21,054 --> 01:07:22,922
Grace, I love it.

1017
01:07:22,954 --> 01:07:25,728
This is our defense.
Jesus as a historic

1018
01:07:25,729 --> 01:07:27,960
figure, just like everyone else.

1019
01:07:27,992 --> 01:07:31,063
And you know what?
Kane will never see it coming.

1020
01:07:41,139 --> 01:07:43,009
You got some reading to do.

1021
01:07:47,945 --> 01:07:50,481
Just had so many notes
written in the margins

1022
01:07:50,514 --> 01:07:55,320
that for the first time I felt like I
was truly getting to know my brother,

1023
01:07:55,353 --> 01:07:59,224
like God gave me
the extra five minutes

1024
01:07:59,257 --> 01:08:00,992
that I so desperately
needed with him.

1025
01:08:03,295 --> 01:08:07,266
I just don't understand why
never told me about his faith.

1026
01:08:07,298 --> 01:08:10,068
Sharing one's faith
with family,

1027
01:08:10,101 --> 01:08:13,504
especially not knowing
how they will react,

1028
01:08:13,538 --> 01:08:15,641
can be difficult.

1029
01:08:15,673 --> 01:08:19,011
Count our struggles
as blessings, right?

1030
01:08:21,145 --> 01:08:23,215
That is exactly right.

1031
01:08:28,552 --> 01:08:32,557
There are more than five minutes
awaiting you and your brother.

1032
01:08:32,591 --> 01:08:37,096
John chapter 11,
verse 25 to 26 says,

1033
01:08:37,128 --> 01:08:39,530
"I am the resurrection
and the life.

1034
01:08:39,564 --> 01:08:43,903
Who believes in me
will live even if dies.

1035
01:08:43,935 --> 01:08:48,139
And whoever lives and believes
in me will never die."

1036
01:08:49,307 --> 01:08:51,077
Do you believe this?

1037
01:08:52,543 --> 01:08:54,445
I do.

1038
01:08:54,479 --> 01:08:57,149
Then invite him
into your heart

1039
01:08:57,181 --> 01:09:00,086
and make him
the Lord of your life.

1040
01:09:10,695 --> 01:09:16,001
Dear Lord, I'm not quite
sure what to say, but...

1041
01:09:18,403 --> 01:09:21,039
thank you for dying
on the cross for me.

1042
01:09:23,175 --> 01:09:25,043
Please forgive me
of my sin.

1043
01:09:26,545 --> 01:09:30,548
Jesus, please come
into my life,

1044
01:09:30,582 --> 01:09:33,986
and I will follow you
as my Lord and Savior.

1045
01:09:36,421 --> 01:09:37,990
Amen.

1046
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:50,136
Thank you.

1047
01:09:59,411 --> 01:10:02,181
Can you state your name
and occupation for the court?

1048
01:10:02,213 --> 01:10:03,748
My name is Lee Strobel.

1049
01:10:03,782 --> 01:10:07,052
I'm a professor of Christian thought
at Houston Baptist University

1050
01:10:07,085 --> 01:10:09,587
and the author of more than
20 books about Christianity,

1051
01:10:09,621 --> 01:10:11,457
<i>including
The Case for Christ.</i>

1052
01:10:11,489 --> 01:10:15,193
Can you help me prove
the existence of Jesus Christ?

1053
01:10:15,226 --> 01:10:18,096
Absolutely, beyond
any reasonable doubt.

1054
01:10:18,130 --> 01:10:20,265
How so?

1055
01:10:20,297 --> 01:10:24,068
Actually, this court already
affirmed it when the date was given.

1056
01:10:24,101 --> 01:10:28,106
Our calendar has been
split between BC and AD,

1057
01:10:28,140 --> 01:10:29,641
based on
the birth of Jesus,

1058
01:10:29,673 --> 01:10:32,176
which is quite a feat
if never existed.

1059
01:10:32,210 --> 01:10:35,314
Beyond that,
historian Gary Habermas

1060
01:10:35,346 --> 01:10:39,083
lists 39 ancient sources
for Jesus,

1061
01:10:39,117 --> 01:10:42,554
from which enumerates
more than 100 reported facts

1062
01:10:42,587 --> 01:10:47,192
about his life, teachings,
crucifixion and resurrection.

1063
01:10:47,225 --> 01:10:49,328
In fact,
the historical evidence

1064
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:52,296
for Jesus' execution
is so strong

1065
01:10:52,329 --> 01:10:55,800
that one of the most famous New
Testament scholars in the world,

1066
01:10:55,833 --> 01:10:58,436
Gerd Ldemann of Germany,
said,

1067
01:10:58,470 --> 01:11:01,273
"Jesus' death as a
consequence of crucifixion

1068
01:11:01,305 --> 01:11:03,041
is indisputable."

1069
01:11:03,074 --> 01:11:06,045
Now, there are very few facts
in ancient history

1070
01:11:06,078 --> 01:11:11,283
that a critical historian like Gerd
Ldemann will say is indisputable.

1071
01:11:11,315 --> 01:11:14,452
One of them is the
execution of Jesus Christ.

1072
01:11:14,485 --> 01:11:16,622
Forgive me, but you're a
believer, are you not?

1073
01:11:16,654 --> 01:11:19,657
-A Bible-believing Christian?
-Guilty as charged.

1074
01:11:19,690 --> 01:11:23,362
So, wouldn't this tend
to inflate your estimate

1075
01:11:23,395 --> 01:11:26,231
of the probability
that Jesus existed.

1076
01:11:26,264 --> 01:11:28,400
No, because we
don't need to inflate it.

1077
01:11:28,432 --> 01:11:31,703
We can reconstruct the
basic facts about Jesus

1078
01:11:31,735 --> 01:11:35,273
just from non-Christian
sources outside the Bible.

1079
01:11:35,306 --> 01:11:38,810
And Gerd Ldemann
is an atheist.

1080
01:11:38,844 --> 01:11:42,480
In other words, we can prove
the existence of Jesus

1081
01:11:42,514 --> 01:11:44,404
solely by using
sources that have

1082
01:11:44,405 --> 01:11:46,851
absolutely no sympathy
toward Christianity.

1083
01:11:46,885 --> 01:11:50,556
As the agnostic historian,
Bart Ehrman, says,

1084
01:11:50,588 --> 01:11:54,859
"Jesus did exist,
whether we like it or not."

1085
01:11:54,893 --> 01:11:57,195
I put it this way.

1086
01:11:57,229 --> 01:12:01,100
Denying the existence of Jesus
doesn't make him go away.

1087
01:12:01,132 --> 01:12:04,836
It merely proves that no amount
of evidence will convince you.

1088
01:12:04,869 --> 01:12:08,106
Thank you. No further
questions, Your Honor.

1089
01:12:09,507 --> 01:12:11,777
Mr. Kane, your witness.

1090
01:12:12,911 --> 01:12:15,213
No questions, Your Honor.

1091
01:12:15,247 --> 01:12:16,782
That's lunch.

1092
01:12:16,814 --> 01:12:19,384
We'll recess until 2:00 p.m.

1093
01:12:27,391 --> 01:12:29,827
Can I help you
with something?

1094
01:12:29,860 --> 01:12:31,697
Hi.

1095
01:12:31,729 --> 01:12:34,265
I was looking
for Pastor Dave.

1096
01:12:34,298 --> 01:12:37,336
My friend, Mina, she said
I should come see him.

1097
01:12:38,569 --> 01:12:41,273
She said's real
easy to talk to.

1098
01:12:41,305 --> 01:12:43,274
Won't be back
until after next week.

1099
01:12:43,307 --> 01:12:45,377
Okay. Thanks.

1100
01:12:45,409 --> 01:12:49,380
Sweeping is something
I only do part-time.

1101
01:12:49,413 --> 01:12:52,317
I enjoy it because
it helps me think.

1102
01:12:52,350 --> 01:12:56,588
But if you need to talk,
I'm actually a pastor.

1103
01:12:58,856 --> 01:13:04,363
It's been three weeks since my
doctors told me I was in remission.

1104
01:13:04,395 --> 01:13:06,864
-Amy, that's wonderful.
-It is.

1105
01:13:06,898 --> 01:13:08,800
Yes.

1106
01:13:08,832 --> 01:13:11,870
But even though
I've been given this gift,

1107
01:13:13,805 --> 01:13:16,876
I've been questioning my faith.

1108
01:13:18,409 --> 01:13:20,445
I know Jesus existed, but...

1109
01:13:21,613 --> 01:13:23,448
I'm struggling to believe.

1110
01:13:23,480 --> 01:13:26,652
Actually, I think you
already do believe,

1111
01:13:26,685 --> 01:13:29,621
and the proof is you're not willing
to put God back on the shelf

1112
01:13:29,654 --> 01:13:31,924
now that
your cancer is gone.

1113
01:13:31,957 --> 01:13:34,627
Won't let you
dismiss the thought of him.

1114
01:13:35,793 --> 01:13:37,962
Part of you senses
Jesus' presence

1115
01:13:37,996 --> 01:13:42,234
and wishes that would just
go away and leave you alone.

1116
01:13:42,266 --> 01:13:44,702
Actually,
now that you mention it,

1117
01:13:44,735 --> 01:13:46,704
I had thought of that.

1118
01:13:46,738 --> 01:13:52,511
Look, delights in using us
in ways we never dreamed of

1119
01:13:52,543 --> 01:13:56,247
and giving us things that we
never even knew we wanted.

1120
01:13:56,280 --> 01:13:59,318
We just have to
give him a chance.

1121
01:13:59,350 --> 01:14:00,685
Will you?

1122
01:14:06,358 --> 01:14:07,726
Thank you.

1123
01:14:13,931 --> 01:14:15,900
Hi.
I'm Reverend David Hill.

1124
01:14:15,934 --> 01:14:17,502
Sermon transcripts,
right?

1125
01:14:17,534 --> 01:14:18,552
Yes.

1126
01:14:18,553 --> 01:14:19,570
Just put it right there.

1127
01:14:19,604 --> 01:14:21,539
They've been coming in
all morning.

1128
01:14:23,675 --> 01:14:25,744
I'm sure they did what
they thought was best.

1129
01:14:31,783 --> 01:14:33,785
That's it?

1130
01:14:33,818 --> 01:14:37,322
Those are your entire sermons
for the past 120 days?

1131
01:14:37,354 --> 01:14:39,657
No, that's a letter
that I wrote

1132
01:14:39,690 --> 01:14:42,461
explaining why I'm not
going to hand them in.

1133
01:14:42,493 --> 01:14:44,563
Excuse me?

1134
01:14:44,595 --> 01:14:46,664
I know it's unusual
for a Christian pastor

1135
01:14:46,698 --> 01:14:51,436
to willfully resist a subpoena issued
by a lawful government authority,

1136
01:14:51,469 --> 01:14:54,939
and it's even more unusual that
should feel compelled to do so.

1137
01:14:54,972 --> 01:14:58,010
Are you sure
you wanna do that?

1138
01:14:59,877 --> 01:15:01,712
It's something
that I have to do.

1139
01:15:01,746 --> 01:15:05,417
You know the old saying, "The squeaky
wheel gets the grease," don't you?

1140
01:15:06,417 --> 01:15:08,319
I have another saying.

1141
01:15:08,353 --> 01:15:12,524
"A nail that sticks up
gets hammered down."

1142
01:15:41,786 --> 01:15:44,369
<i>I'm seeing a teacher
who answered a student's</i>

1143
01:15:44,370 --> 01:15:46,091
<i>question to the
best of her ability.</i>

1144
01:15:46,123 --> 01:15:49,327
<i>Amy, it sounds like you're taking
the side of Grace Wesley here.</i>

1145
01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:51,333
<i>Surely, you see that
she used the student's</i>

1146
01:15:51,334 --> 01:15:53,097
<i>question to promote
her Christian agenda.</i>

1147
01:15:53,131 --> 01:15:54,966
<i>Actually,
that's not how I see it.</i>

1148
01:15:54,998 --> 01:15:58,002
<i>I believe Ms. Wesley's entitled
to her own opinions,</i>

1149
01:15:58,036 --> 01:15:59,938
<i>and that includes
in the classroom.</i>

1150
01:15:59,970 --> 01:16:02,606
<i>She didn't try to convert
these students. In fact...</i>

1151
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:04,910
<i>Amy, I must say,
I'm shocked at what seems to be</i>

1152
01:16:04,943 --> 01:16:08,547
<i>a complete 180 from the typical
stance of your blog.</i>

1153
01:16:08,579 --> 01:16:10,782
<i>Just look at the facts
of this case.</i>

1154
01:16:10,814 --> 01:16:13,652
<i>She clearly infringed on
the rights of her students.</i>

1155
01:16:13,685 --> 01:16:16,688
Marlene?
I have an idea.

1156
01:16:16,720 --> 01:16:19,090
Come over as soon
as you can, okay?

1157
01:16:21,458 --> 01:16:22,927
You look terrible.

1158
01:16:22,961 --> 01:16:25,564
-You really ought to ask to be excused.
-No.

1159
01:16:25,596 --> 01:16:28,532
No, I'm fine.
I really need to be here.

1160
01:16:28,565 --> 01:16:29,568
All rise.

1161
01:16:34,104 --> 01:16:36,841
You may be seated.

1162
01:16:36,875 --> 01:16:39,511
Juror number 12, is there
something you'd like to say?

1163
01:16:39,543 --> 01:16:41,445
I'm sorry, Your Honor,
I gotta...

1164
01:16:41,479 --> 01:16:44,015
Bailiff, call paramedics.

1165
01:16:44,047 --> 01:16:45,684
Sir.

1166
01:16:45,716 --> 01:16:47,885
I guess that proves
there is no God,

1167
01:16:47,918 --> 01:16:50,555
'cause they just lost the only
juror they could count on.

1168
01:16:53,858 --> 01:16:54,926
Any dizziness?

1169
01:16:54,927 --> 01:16:55,994
Yeah.

1170
01:16:56,027 --> 01:16:57,262
Vomiting?

1171
01:16:57,263 --> 01:16:58,497
About a half hour ago.

1172
01:16:58,529 --> 01:17:01,565
Does this hurt?
How 'bout this?

1173
01:17:01,599 --> 01:17:03,534
I hope you're not
too attached to your appendix.

1174
01:17:27,992 --> 01:17:29,895
-Brooke!
-Marlene.

1175
01:17:32,564 --> 01:17:34,600
It's not looking good
in there.

1176
01:18:02,760 --> 01:18:06,530
Ms. Marshall, are you prepared to
fulfill your duties as an alternate?

1177
01:18:06,564 --> 01:18:08,834
Yes, I am, Your Honor.

1178
01:18:08,867 --> 01:18:11,536
Mr. Endler, next witness.

1179
01:18:11,569 --> 01:18:13,772
State your name
and experience for the record.

1180
01:18:13,805 --> 01:18:15,941
My name is
James Warner Wallace.

1181
01:18:15,974 --> 01:18:18,743
I'm a retired homicide detective
from Los Angeles County.

1182
01:18:18,775 --> 01:18:22,168
<i>And are you the author of the
book Cold Case Christianity?</i>

1183
01:18:22,169 --> 01:18:22,570
<i>Yes, I am.</i>

1184
01:18:22,571 --> 01:18:25,549
Can you share the subtitle of
the book with the court, please?

1185
01:18:25,582 --> 01:18:28,853
<i>A Homicide Detective Investigates
the Claims of the Gospels.</i>

1186
01:18:28,886 --> 01:18:32,224
Would I be correct in saying that
your duties as a homicide detective

1187
01:18:32,256 --> 01:18:34,625
include investigating
cold case homicides?

1188
01:18:34,658 --> 01:18:36,994
Yes, that is
and was my expertise.

1189
01:18:37,028 --> 01:18:39,998
Don't most of those cases
get solved with DNA evidence?

1190
01:18:40,030 --> 01:18:41,966
Objection. Leading.

1191
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,034
And counsel is
testifying again, Your Honor.

1192
01:18:44,068 --> 01:18:45,971
I'll rephrase.

1193
01:18:46,003 --> 01:18:49,908
How many of your cold cases were solved
through the use of DNA evidence?

1194
01:18:49,940 --> 01:18:52,042
None. Not one.

1195
01:18:52,076 --> 01:18:55,012
That's often popular on TV, but our
departments never had the good fortune

1196
01:18:55,046 --> 01:18:57,983
of solving a cold case
with DNA.

1197
01:18:58,015 --> 01:18:59,984
How do most of these cases
get solved?

1198
01:19:00,018 --> 01:19:02,052
Often by examining
eyewitness claims,

1199
01:19:02,086 --> 01:19:04,256
witness claims that were
made many years earlier,

1200
01:19:04,288 --> 01:19:07,291
even though often our
witnesses are now deceased.

1201
01:19:07,324 --> 01:19:10,761
Forgive my ignorance, Mr. Wallace,
but how is that possible?

1202
01:19:10,795 --> 01:19:12,780
We have a number of
techniques we can use

1203
01:19:12,781 --> 01:19:14,765
to test the reliability
of an eyewitness,

1204
01:19:14,798 --> 01:19:17,702
including something called
forensic statement analysis.

1205
01:19:17,734 --> 01:19:20,237
That's a discipline where we scrutinize
the statements of eyewitnesses,

1206
01:19:20,270 --> 01:19:22,139
looking at what
they choose to minimize,

1207
01:19:22,172 --> 01:19:24,809
what they choose to emphasize,
what they omit altogether,

1208
01:19:24,841 --> 01:19:27,211
how they expand time
or contract time.

1209
01:19:27,244 --> 01:19:30,548
And when we examine these
kinds of eyewitness accounts,

1210
01:19:30,582 --> 01:19:33,020
we can usually tell who's
lying and who's telling

1211
01:19:33,021 --> 01:19:35,020
the truth, even who
the guilty party is.

1212
01:19:35,052 --> 01:19:39,890
And did you apply this skill set any
time outside of your official capacity?

1213
01:19:39,923 --> 01:19:41,923
Yes, I applied my
expertise to the death

1214
01:19:41,924 --> 01:19:43,728
of Jesus at the
hands of the Romans,

1215
01:19:43,761 --> 01:19:46,064
and I actually
looked at the gospels

1216
01:19:46,096 --> 01:19:49,099
as I would any other set
of forensic statements.

1217
01:19:49,132 --> 01:19:52,636
Within a matter of months I
determined that the four gospels,

1218
01:19:52,670 --> 01:19:54,072
written from different
perspectives,

1219
01:19:54,104 --> 01:19:56,674
contained
the eyewitness accounts

1220
01:19:56,707 --> 01:20:00,144
about the life, ministry, death
and resurrection of Jesus.

1221
01:20:00,177 --> 01:20:02,646
Did you consider
that the four accounts

1222
01:20:02,680 --> 01:20:06,952
might be part of a conspiracy designed
to promote belief in a fledgling faith?

1223
01:20:06,984 --> 01:20:10,255
Yeah, you have to consider conspiracies
when assessing eyewitness accounts,

1224
01:20:10,287 --> 01:20:14,725
but successful conspiracies typically
involve the fewest number of people.

1225
01:20:14,759 --> 01:20:18,663
It's easier for two people to lie and
keep a secret than it is for 20.

1226
01:20:18,695 --> 01:20:20,993
And that's the problem
with conspiracy theories

1227
01:20:20,994 --> 01:20:23,100
related to the apostles
in the 1st century.

1228
01:20:23,134 --> 01:20:25,197
There are far too many
of them trying to hold

1229
01:20:25,198 --> 01:20:27,305
this conspiracy for too
long a period of time.

1230
01:20:27,337 --> 01:20:31,009
And far worse, they're experiencing
pressure like no other...

1231
01:20:31,042 --> 01:20:32,978
Unimaginable pressure.

1232
01:20:33,011 --> 01:20:37,015
Every one of these folks was tortured
and died for what they claimed to see,

1233
01:20:37,047 --> 01:20:40,184
and none of them
ever recanted their story.

1234
01:20:40,217 --> 01:20:43,622
So the idea that this is a
conspiracy in the first century

1235
01:20:43,654 --> 01:20:45,055
is just really unreasonable.

1236
01:20:45,088 --> 01:20:47,158
Instead,
what I see in the gospels

1237
01:20:47,190 --> 01:20:50,260
is something I call unintended
eyewitness support statements.

1238
01:20:50,293 --> 01:20:52,863
What's an unintended
eyewitness support statement?

1239
01:20:52,896 --> 01:20:54,298
If I can borrow
your Bible.

1240
01:20:59,002 --> 01:21:02,940
Let me go to the Gospel of
Matthew for an example of this.

1241
01:21:02,974 --> 01:21:05,260
I'll start with a
passage in which Jesus

1242
01:21:05,261 --> 01:21:07,378
is in front of
Caiaphas at a hearing.

1243
01:21:07,412 --> 01:21:11,650
It says here, "Then they spit in his
face and struck him with their fists.

1244
01:21:11,682 --> 01:21:15,252
Others slapped him and said, 'Prophesy
to us, Christ. Who hit you?'"

1245
01:21:15,286 --> 01:21:17,322
That seems like
a very simple request.

1246
01:21:17,354 --> 01:21:20,190
The people who hit him are
standing right in front of him.

1247
01:21:20,224 --> 01:21:22,015
This makes no sense.
Why would it be

1248
01:21:22,016 --> 01:21:24,194
prophecy to be able to
tell you who hit you?

1249
01:21:24,228 --> 01:21:27,231
But it's not until you read Luke
that you get an answer to this.

1250
01:21:27,265 --> 01:21:31,970
Says, "The men who were guarding
Jesus began mocking and beating him.

1251
01:21:32,002 --> 01:21:35,239
They blindfolded him and demanded,
'Prophesy! Who hit you?'"

1252
01:21:35,273 --> 01:21:37,193
Now we know why this
was a challenge...

1253
01:21:37,194 --> 01:21:39,210
Luke tells us the
thing Matthew left out,

1254
01:21:39,243 --> 01:21:42,280
that was actually blindfolded
at the time this took place.

1255
01:21:42,313 --> 01:21:45,417
This is very common, this kind of
unintentional eyewitness support

1256
01:21:45,449 --> 01:21:48,752
that fills in a detail that
the first witness left out.

1257
01:21:48,786 --> 01:21:51,021
After years of
scrutinizing these gospels

1258
01:21:51,055 --> 01:21:54,426
using the template that I use to
determine if an eyewitness is reliable,

1259
01:21:54,458 --> 01:21:57,327
I concluded that the
four gospels in this book

1260
01:21:57,360 --> 01:22:01,832
contained the reliable accounts
of the actual words of Jesus.

1261
01:22:03,835 --> 01:22:06,971
And that's to include the statements
quoted by Ms. Wesley in her class?

1262
01:22:07,003 --> 01:22:08,273
Absolutely.

1263
01:22:11,341 --> 01:22:12,844
Thank you, Detective.

1264
01:22:14,779 --> 01:22:16,848
Your witness.

1265
01:22:18,048 --> 01:22:20,385
Detective Wallace,

1266
01:22:20,417 --> 01:22:23,954
I'm not gonna try to match
biblical knowledge with you.

1267
01:22:25,456 --> 01:22:30,360
But isn't it true that these gospel
accounts vary widely in what they say,

1268
01:22:30,394 --> 01:22:33,998
that there are numerous discrepancies
between these accounts?

1269
01:22:34,030 --> 01:22:37,034
Absolutely. But that's exactly
what we should expect.

1270
01:22:37,068 --> 01:22:40,805
I don't quite
understand that.

1271
01:22:40,837 --> 01:22:42,390
Reliable eyewitness
accounts always differ

1272
01:22:42,391 --> 01:22:43,942
slightly in the way
they recall the story.

1273
01:22:43,975 --> 01:22:46,811
They're coming to it from different
geographic perspectives, their history,

1274
01:22:46,844 --> 01:22:48,480
even where they are
located in the room.

1275
01:22:48,512 --> 01:22:50,280
When I examined
the gospels,

1276
01:22:50,314 --> 01:22:53,251
I was trying to determine if these
were accurate, reliable accounts,

1277
01:22:53,283 --> 01:22:56,487
in spite of any differences there
might be between the accounts.

1278
01:22:56,520 --> 01:23:01,458
And as a devout Christian,
you feel you succeeded?

1279
01:23:01,492 --> 01:23:04,863
Mr. Kane, I think
you misunderstand me.

1280
01:23:04,895 --> 01:23:07,898
When I began this study,
I was a devout atheist.

1281
01:23:07,931 --> 01:23:11,101
I began examining the gospels
as a committed skeptic,

1282
01:23:11,135 --> 01:23:13,003
not as a believer.

1283
01:23:13,037 --> 01:23:16,007
You see, I wasn't raised
in a Christian environment,

1284
01:23:16,039 --> 01:23:19,409
although I do think I have an unusually
high regard for the value of evidence.

1285
01:23:19,443 --> 01:23:22,079
I'm not a Christian because
I was raised that way

1286
01:23:22,113 --> 01:23:26,050
or because I hoped it would satisfy
some need or accomplish some goal.

1287
01:23:26,082 --> 01:23:29,120
I'm simply a Christian
because it's evidentially true.

1288
01:23:33,190 --> 01:23:35,559
-Motion to strike, Your Honor.
-Granted.

1289
01:23:35,592 --> 01:23:40,164
Jury's instructed to ignore
Detective Wallace's last remarks.

1290
01:23:40,198 --> 01:23:42,167
No further questions.

1291
01:23:42,199 --> 01:23:43,867
Witness is excused.

1292
01:23:43,900 --> 01:23:45,970
Thank you, Your Honor.

1293
01:23:51,509 --> 01:23:54,045
Mr. Endler,
your next witness.

1294
01:23:54,078 --> 01:23:55,446
We don't have one,
Your Honor.

1295
01:23:57,381 --> 01:23:59,918
She didn't do anything wrong!
She was just trying to help me!

1296
01:23:59,951 --> 01:24:02,854
-Brooke!
-Order! I'll have order!

1297
01:24:02,886 --> 01:24:05,489
Young lady,
your youth is no excuse

1298
01:24:05,523 --> 01:24:07,958
for disturbing
the sanctity of this court.

1299
01:24:07,992 --> 01:24:10,128
But this case is
supposed to be about me.

1300
01:24:10,161 --> 01:24:13,530
I'm almost 17 years old. It's not
like I can't think for myself.

1301
01:24:13,564 --> 01:24:16,234
-I just don't have the right to speak.
-Brooke, what are you doing?

1302
01:24:16,266 --> 01:24:18,603
Not unless you are called
as a witness, young lady.

1303
01:24:18,636 --> 01:24:21,406
If I put her on the stand,
what am I gonna hear?

1304
01:24:21,439 --> 01:24:23,375
That she asked a question
and I answered it.

1305
01:24:26,644 --> 01:24:30,048
Your Honor, we'd like to call Ms.
Brooke Thawley to the stand.

1306
01:24:30,081 --> 01:24:32,884
Objection, Your Honor.
Ms. Thawley is a minor.

1307
01:24:32,917 --> 01:24:37,055
Her parents do not want her
subjected to the emotional pressure

1308
01:24:37,087 --> 01:24:39,224
of testifying against
her own teacher.

1309
01:24:39,256 --> 01:24:43,060
Ms. Thawley, are you willing
to testify on your own behalf?

1310
01:24:43,094 --> 01:24:44,362
Yes, Your Honor.

1311
01:24:44,395 --> 01:24:47,031
And do you understand that
you will have to answer

1312
01:24:47,064 --> 01:24:50,034
all the questions truthfully,
regardless of your feelings,

1313
01:24:50,067 --> 01:24:54,471
and that failure to do so
is punishable by law?

1314
01:24:54,505 --> 01:24:57,141
Yes, Your Honor. I'm not
afraid of telling the truth.

1315
01:24:57,173 --> 01:24:59,476
<i>I'm only afraid
of not being able to tell it.</i>

1316
01:25:13,157 --> 01:25:14,993
I will allow
this witness.

1317
01:25:16,193 --> 01:25:17,929
Objection overruled.

1318
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,936
Brooke, in class,

1319
01:25:25,970 --> 01:25:29,340
who first brought up the name
Jesus, you or Ms. Wesley?

1320
01:25:29,372 --> 01:25:30,942
I did.

1321
01:25:30,975 --> 01:25:32,694
As part of a question?

1322
01:25:32,695 --> 01:25:34,412
Yes.

1323
01:25:34,444 --> 01:25:38,682
And at that time, did you feel like you
were asking a faith-based question?

1324
01:25:38,716 --> 01:25:40,685
No, not really.

1325
01:25:40,717 --> 01:25:44,454
It just seemed like Martin Luther King
and Jesus were saying similar things,

1326
01:25:44,488 --> 01:25:46,990
so I brought it up.

1327
01:25:47,024 --> 01:25:48,865
Did you consider Ms.
Wesley's response to

1328
01:25:48,866 --> 01:25:50,662
be a reasonable answer
to your question?

1329
01:25:50,694 --> 01:25:52,496
Yes.

1330
01:25:52,529 --> 01:25:54,965
So, if I'm hearing you
correctly,

1331
01:25:54,998 --> 01:25:58,135
you asked a question
in history class

1332
01:25:58,168 --> 01:26:00,671
about a historical figure,

1333
01:26:00,704 --> 01:26:04,242
and your history teacher answered
it in a sensible manner?

1334
01:26:04,274 --> 01:26:06,010
Yes.

1335
01:26:09,246 --> 01:26:10,681
Thank you.

1336
01:26:12,015 --> 01:26:13,484
Your witness.

1337
01:26:23,027 --> 01:26:26,631
Ms. Thawley,
do you like Ms. Wesley?

1338
01:26:26,663 --> 01:26:28,131
Yes.

1339
01:26:28,164 --> 01:26:31,002
Would you say
she's your favorite teacher?

1340
01:26:31,034 --> 01:26:32,436
Yes, absolutely.

1341
01:26:32,470 --> 01:26:34,472
Do you think
Ms. Wesley likes you?

1342
01:26:34,505 --> 01:26:37,074
Objection. Speculative.

1343
01:26:37,108 --> 01:26:40,144
Your Honor, it speaks to the
state of mind of the witness,

1344
01:26:40,176 --> 01:26:42,045
if not Ms. Wesley herself.

1345
01:26:42,078 --> 01:26:45,182
I'm gonna allow it. Overruled.
You may answer the question.

1346
01:26:46,751 --> 01:26:50,154
Yes, I think
she likes me.

1347
01:26:50,186 --> 01:26:54,224
Do you think there's any possibility
that in answering your question,

1348
01:26:54,257 --> 01:26:59,063
she may have tried to share
some of the ideas of her faith,

1349
01:26:59,095 --> 01:27:01,398
a faith that she holds
most dear?

1350
01:27:01,431 --> 01:27:03,300
N... No.
Not at that moment.

1351
01:27:03,301 --> 01:27:05,168
Not at that moment?

1352
01:27:05,202 --> 01:27:08,039
You mean to say that
there were other moments

1353
01:27:08,072 --> 01:27:11,443
in which she talked to you
about her faith?

1354
01:27:14,045 --> 01:27:16,480
Ms. Thawley, please?

1355
01:27:16,514 --> 01:27:19,050
You must answer the question,
Ms. Thawley.

1356
01:27:23,319 --> 01:27:26,757
Yes, but it was outside of school,
and it was only one time.

1357
01:27:26,791 --> 01:27:29,427
Move to strike.
Your Honor, this is irrelevant.

1358
01:27:29,460 --> 01:27:32,296
No actions off the school
campus are at issue here.

1359
01:27:32,328 --> 01:27:35,365
Denied. Mr. Kane seems to
have found a loose thread.

1360
01:27:35,399 --> 01:27:39,070
I'm inclined to let him pull it,
see what unravels.

1361
01:27:39,103 --> 01:27:40,805
Thank you, Your Honor.

1362
01:27:40,837 --> 01:27:43,608
-Why didn't you tell me about this?
-You didn't ask.

1363
01:27:43,640 --> 01:27:46,043
And I didn't think
it mattered.

1364
01:27:46,077 --> 01:27:49,079
Brooke, you realize that you
have to tell the truth here.

1365
01:27:49,113 --> 01:27:51,449
-You understand that, correct?
-Yes.

1366
01:27:51,481 --> 01:27:54,351
So, what did you mean
when you said

1367
01:27:54,385 --> 01:27:57,588
that you had talks about faith
outside of school?

1368
01:28:01,859 --> 01:28:05,163
My brother died in an
accident six months ago.

1369
01:28:07,765 --> 01:28:10,501
Ms. Wesley noticed that
I wasn't doing so well,

1370
01:28:10,533 --> 01:28:13,570
so she asked me if everything
was all right after class.

1371
01:28:13,604 --> 01:28:15,773
I told her I was fine.

1372
01:28:15,805 --> 01:28:19,609
But I went and found her
later on at the coffee shop.

1373
01:28:19,643 --> 01:28:24,349
And did Ms. Wesley refer you to any
kind of psychological counseling?

1374
01:28:26,484 --> 01:28:27,752
No.

1375
01:28:27,784 --> 01:28:30,720
Did she suggest
that perhaps

1376
01:28:30,753 --> 01:28:34,492
she wasn't the right person
to be discussing this with you?

1377
01:28:35,658 --> 01:28:37,360
No.

1378
01:28:37,394 --> 01:28:39,630
Well, then what
did Ms. Wesley do?

1379
01:28:39,662 --> 01:28:41,698
She was really nice.

1380
01:28:41,731 --> 01:28:46,604
We talked for a long time, and I
could tell that she really cared.

1381
01:28:46,636 --> 01:28:50,240
I asked her how she kept it
all together so well,

1382
01:28:50,274 --> 01:28:52,376
and she said,
"Jesus."

1383
01:28:52,408 --> 01:28:55,412
So, she's the one
who brought up Jesus?

1384
01:28:55,445 --> 01:29:00,751
Did her endorsement of Jesus move
you to explore Christianity?

1385
01:29:00,783 --> 01:29:02,552
Yes, at first.

1386
01:29:02,586 --> 01:29:07,425
But when the Salvation Army came
to pick up my brother's things,

1387
01:29:07,457 --> 01:29:11,261
one of the ladies found his
Bible and she gave it to me.

1388
01:29:13,730 --> 01:29:17,167
I didn't even know
that had one.

1389
01:29:17,201 --> 01:29:19,703
So I started reading it,

1390
01:29:19,737 --> 01:29:22,172
and once I started
I realized that...

1391
01:29:23,340 --> 01:29:25,510
I didn't wanna stop.

1392
01:29:25,542 --> 01:29:27,878
That's why.

1393
01:29:27,912 --> 01:29:31,315
That's why I came up with the
question that I asked in class.

1394
01:29:31,347 --> 01:29:34,484
Now, if I understand
you correctly,

1395
01:29:34,518 --> 01:29:37,688
without Ms. Wesley's
direct involvement,

1396
01:29:37,720 --> 01:29:41,892
you never would have asked that
question in the first place, would you?

1397
01:29:41,926 --> 01:29:43,594
I don't know.

1398
01:29:43,627 --> 01:29:46,197
After all of your
Bible readings,

1399
01:29:47,730 --> 01:29:51,469
do you feel now
that you're a believer?

1400
01:29:53,436 --> 01:29:55,305
Yes.

1401
01:29:55,338 --> 01:29:57,774
Maybe even a... Christian?

1402
01:30:00,877 --> 01:30:02,712
Yes.

1403
01:30:04,715 --> 01:30:06,617
At the risk
of seeming redundant,

1404
01:30:06,649 --> 01:30:08,752
do you think any of this...

1405
01:30:08,786 --> 01:30:13,623
The Bible readings, the
question about Jesus in class,

1406
01:30:13,657 --> 01:30:15,927
the newfound commitment
to Christianity,

1407
01:30:15,960 --> 01:30:19,596
is it likely that any of that
would've occurred

1408
01:30:19,630 --> 01:30:22,867
without Ms. Wesley's
direct involvement?

1409
01:30:24,801 --> 01:30:28,338
No, it wouldn't.

1410
01:30:29,506 --> 01:30:31,376
I thank you
for your honesty.

1411
01:30:32,576 --> 01:30:35,313
No further questions,
Your Honor.

1412
01:30:35,345 --> 01:30:37,915
Mr. Endler,
do you wish to redirect?

1413
01:30:39,283 --> 01:30:41,485
No, Your Honor.

1414
01:30:41,518 --> 01:30:44,189
You may step down,
Ms. Thawley.

1415
01:30:59,403 --> 01:31:01,372
Why do they look
so angry?

1416
01:31:01,404 --> 01:31:03,440
Because they think
we lied to them.

1417
01:31:03,474 --> 01:31:04,876
But we didn't.

1418
01:31:06,377 --> 01:31:08,913
It doesn't matter.

1419
01:31:08,945 --> 01:31:10,414
This court is adjourned.

1420
01:31:17,988 --> 01:31:20,691
I have to
prepare you, Grace.

1421
01:31:20,724 --> 01:31:22,694
We're gonna lose
this case.

1422
01:31:25,595 --> 01:31:26,964
I know.

1423
01:31:28,798 --> 01:31:30,568
You were right.

1424
01:31:30,600 --> 01:31:32,469
I'm gonna lose everything.

1425
01:31:53,923 --> 01:31:56,694
<i>We saw a very large crowd
at the courthouse yesterday,</i>

1426
01:31:56,726 --> 01:32:00,730
<i>both in protest and support
of teacher Grace Wesley,</i>

1427
01:32:00,764 --> 01:32:03,734
<i>who is on trial for allegedly
proselytizing at the classroom.</i>

1428
01:32:03,766 --> 01:32:05,836
<i>In an unexpected
move yesterday,</i>

1429
01:32:05,868 --> 01:32:07,938
<i>we saw some of Wesley's
former students</i>

1430
01:32:07,970 --> 01:32:11,642
<i>come out to silently demonstrate
their support for their teacher.</i>

1431
01:32:25,389 --> 01:32:27,592
O Father, please
take this from me.

1432
01:32:29,760 --> 01:32:31,296
I...

1433
01:32:33,529 --> 01:32:35,500
I don't know what to do.

1434
01:32:38,969 --> 01:32:41,306
Please don't forsake me.

1435
01:32:42,905 --> 01:32:44,509
Please.

1436
01:33:12,034 --> 01:33:13,837
Hey, Brooke.

1437
01:33:13,871 --> 01:33:16,106
<i>I ruined everything,
didn't I?</i>

1438
01:33:16,140 --> 01:33:18,776
It's okay.
You don't have to answer.

1439
01:33:18,809 --> 01:33:21,712
I know that I did.

1440
01:33:21,744 --> 01:33:24,448
I'm not even allowed
to talk to her.

1441
01:33:24,480 --> 01:33:27,417
How do I let her know that I'm
sorry without making things worse?

1442
01:33:27,451 --> 01:33:29,119
<i>I can't tell you
what to do, but...</i>

1443
01:33:30,921 --> 01:33:35,426
whatever you do,
just let her know you care.

1444
01:33:40,930 --> 01:33:42,854
Recently when I've
been praying, it's like

1445
01:33:42,855 --> 01:33:44,734
Jesus isn't letting
me feel his presence.

1446
01:33:44,768 --> 01:33:48,706
Usually I can almost
reach out and touch him, but...

1447
01:33:50,207 --> 01:33:52,110
But right now it's like...

1448
01:33:53,743 --> 01:33:55,945
It's like
He's a million miles away.

1449
01:33:55,979 --> 01:34:00,951
Honey, you of all people
should realize

1450
01:34:00,984 --> 01:34:03,954
when you're going through
something really hard,

1451
01:34:03,987 --> 01:34:08,059
the teacher is always quiet
during the test.

1452
01:36:04,640 --> 01:36:07,243
<i>First of all, this trial
took an unexpected turn</i>

1453
01:36:07,277 --> 01:36:12,949
<i>when Wesley's counsel decided they'd
try to prove the existence of Jesus.</i>

1454
01:36:12,983 --> 01:36:15,586
<i>Gary, this is kind of
your area of expertise.</i>

1455
01:36:15,618 --> 01:36:18,221
<i>How do you convince
the skeptics?</i>

1456
01:36:18,255 --> 01:36:21,926
<i>Well, Governor, I employ what
I call the minimal facts method,</i>

1457
01:36:21,958 --> 01:36:26,063
<i>which uses only the historical
events that are so well evidenced</i>

1458
01:36:26,095 --> 01:36:28,665
<i>that they're accepted
across the board,</i>

1459
01:36:28,698 --> 01:36:31,100
<i>even by skeptical
and non-Christian scholars.</i>

1460
01:36:33,136 --> 01:36:36,874
Now I understand what it is you
weren't allowed to talk about.

1461
01:36:36,907 --> 01:36:39,842
I wish I still wasn't
allowed to talk about it.

1462
01:36:39,876 --> 01:36:42,279
She needs me on that jury.

1463
01:36:42,311 --> 01:36:45,815
Have faith, David.
God's plan is at work.

1464
01:36:45,849 --> 01:36:47,685
How'd you get here anyway?

1465
01:36:47,717 --> 01:36:50,587
I borrowed your Prius.
It's very nice.

1466
01:36:50,621 --> 01:36:53,958
Don't get too comfortable.
I'm planning a full recovery.

1467
01:36:53,990 --> 01:36:56,694
Do you believe that she was
proselytizing to her students?

1468
01:36:56,726 --> 01:36:58,996
Governor, not at all.

1469
01:36:59,029 --> 01:37:01,966
Jesus Christ was the most
influential person who ever lived.

1470
01:37:01,998 --> 01:37:05,234
How could you ignore
that fact and teach history?

1471
01:37:05,268 --> 01:37:08,005
Hey. Martin.

1472
01:37:08,037 --> 01:37:11,307
More questions? -I wanted to
make sure that you were okay.

1473
01:37:11,341 --> 01:37:14,111
Yeah, I'm fine. They're just holding
me over for a little observation.

1474
01:37:14,144 --> 01:37:15,713
I'll be released soon.

1475
01:37:17,014 --> 01:37:18,716
Something different
about you.

1476
01:37:18,748 --> 01:37:20,650
Are you okay?

1477
01:37:20,684 --> 01:37:23,954
I should say so, yes.

1478
01:37:23,987 --> 01:37:26,323
I believe God wants me
to be a minister,

1479
01:37:26,355 --> 01:37:29,792
to return to my country and
become a pastor, just like you.

1480
01:37:29,826 --> 01:37:31,929
That's great.

1481
01:37:31,962 --> 01:37:35,132
There'll be challenges in your
country. Are you prepared for them?

1482
01:37:37,734 --> 01:37:39,170
I am.

1483
01:37:41,003 --> 01:37:44,007
I'm proud of you.
Come here.

1484
01:37:46,208 --> 01:37:48,945
That's awesome.

1485
01:37:48,979 --> 01:37:52,650
It's a shocking reality that Christians
are soon gonna be forced to choose

1486
01:37:52,682 --> 01:37:56,653
between obeying the law of man
or following the Word of God.

1487
01:37:56,686 --> 01:37:59,856
<i>I'm Mike Huckabee. We'll see you
next time on Points of View.</i>

1488
01:38:28,385 --> 01:38:31,454
Hey, Brooke, go be with Ms. Wesley.
I think we can handle this.

1489
01:38:31,488 --> 01:38:34,692
Yeah, seriously. We've got
backup coming. You're covered.

1490
01:38:38,427 --> 01:38:40,096
Go get 'em.

1491
01:38:44,134 --> 01:38:46,404
God's got this.

1492
01:39:16,966 --> 01:39:18,435
Where's Tom?

1493
01:39:24,274 --> 01:39:26,110
All rise.

1494
01:39:34,083 --> 01:39:36,119
Be seated.

1495
01:39:41,992 --> 01:39:43,927
Are we missing someone?

1496
01:39:49,966 --> 01:39:53,203
Sorry, Your Honor.
My apologies to the court.

1497
01:39:58,007 --> 01:40:00,144
That's unexpected.

1498
01:40:00,176 --> 01:40:02,246
Almost looks
like a lawyer.

1499
01:40:02,279 --> 01:40:05,916
Your Honor, I have
one final witness to call.

1500
01:40:07,216 --> 01:40:09,952
Grace Wesley.

1501
01:40:09,985 --> 01:40:13,990
Ms. Wesley, please approach
the witness stand.

1502
01:40:14,024 --> 01:40:15,793
Do I have to?

1503
01:40:15,826 --> 01:40:17,761
I'm afraid so.

1504
01:40:23,265 --> 01:40:26,302
Your Honor, given the
witness's reluctance to testify,

1505
01:40:26,336 --> 01:40:28,972
can I have the court's permission
to treat her as a hostile witness?

1506
01:40:29,005 --> 01:40:33,010
You may.
Proceed at your own peril.

1507
01:40:36,212 --> 01:40:39,582
Do you swear to tell the truth, the
whole truth, and nothing but the truth?

1508
01:40:39,615 --> 01:40:41,551
-I do.
-Please be seated.

1509
01:40:47,890 --> 01:40:50,359
Grace, I want you
to do something for me,

1510
01:40:50,393 --> 01:40:52,195
something for everyone
in this courtroom.

1511
01:40:53,229 --> 01:40:55,565
I want you to apologize.

1512
01:40:55,599 --> 01:40:58,601
I want you to say you're sorry
and that you made a mistake.

1513
01:40:58,635 --> 01:41:00,838
-Your Honor, what's going on here?
-Do it, Grace.

1514
01:41:02,372 --> 01:41:03,640
I can't do that.

1515
01:41:03,641 --> 01:41:04,908
Why?

1516
01:41:04,940 --> 01:41:06,328
Why can't you do that, Grace?

1517
01:41:06,329 --> 01:41:08,411
Because I don't believe
I did anything wrong.

1518
01:41:08,444 --> 01:41:12,315
Well, as your attorney, I'm
advising you to do it anyway,

1519
01:41:12,349 --> 01:41:14,111
to at least pretend
you're sorry and throw

1520
01:41:14,112 --> 01:41:15,586
yourself on the
mercy of the court.

1521
01:41:15,618 --> 01:41:17,254
What?

1522
01:41:17,255 --> 01:41:18,889
That would be a lie.

1523
01:41:18,921 --> 01:41:21,591
So what?
Everyone lies.

1524
01:41:21,625 --> 01:41:23,426
Not everyone.

1525
01:41:23,460 --> 01:41:25,962
A-Are you looking
to become a martyr?

1526
01:41:25,996 --> 01:41:27,564
What in the world
is doing?

1527
01:41:27,565 --> 01:41:29,132
I have no idea.

1528
01:41:29,164 --> 01:41:30,733
No.

1529
01:41:30,734 --> 01:41:32,301
Tommy.

1530
01:41:32,335 --> 01:41:35,572
Then what is it that you
want, Grace? Tell me.

1531
01:41:35,604 --> 01:41:36,789
Tell us.

1532
01:41:36,790 --> 01:41:37,974
I want...

1533
01:41:40,911 --> 01:41:43,646
I want to be able
to tell the truth.

1534
01:41:43,680 --> 01:41:45,548
The truth?

1535
01:41:45,582 --> 01:41:47,351
Whose truth?

1536
01:41:47,384 --> 01:41:51,288
And what truth
are you referring to?

1537
01:41:51,320 --> 01:41:55,425
Grace, is there some truth that
you know that no one else knows?

1538
01:41:58,261 --> 01:42:00,430
That's right.

1539
01:42:00,462 --> 01:42:05,234
The other night, didn't you tell me
that Jesus spoke to you personally?

1540
01:42:05,268 --> 01:42:08,438
Why are you doing this? -I'm the one
asking the questions, Ms. Wesley.

1541
01:42:08,470 --> 01:42:12,342
Did you or did you not tell me that
Jesus spoke to you personally?

1542
01:42:14,210 --> 01:42:15,613
Yes.

1543
01:42:16,412 --> 01:42:19,315
And what did say?

1544
01:42:19,349 --> 01:42:23,020
I'll make it easier for you. Didn't
you say that asked you a question?

1545
01:42:23,052 --> 01:42:24,871
That was personal.
You weren't supposed to...

1546
01:42:24,872 --> 01:42:26,689
I don't care.

1547
01:42:26,722 --> 01:42:29,061
The other night, you
told me that Jesus asked

1548
01:42:29,062 --> 01:42:31,094
you something. What
did ask you, Grace?

1549
01:42:31,127 --> 01:42:34,064
Tell all of us.
I think we deserve to know.

1550
01:42:34,096 --> 01:42:37,033
-Why are you doing this to me?
-Answer the question.

1551
01:42:37,067 --> 01:42:38,652
They won't believe me.

1552
01:42:38,653 --> 01:42:40,237
Doesn't matter.

1553
01:42:41,438 --> 01:42:44,208
All that matters
is that you believe it.

1554
01:42:46,376 --> 01:42:49,546
Tell us, Grace,
under penalty of perjury,

1555
01:42:49,578 --> 01:42:51,825
what was the question
that God presented

1556
01:42:51,826 --> 01:42:54,018
to you personally
that night on campus?

1557
01:42:56,051 --> 01:42:58,121
Answer the question.

1558
01:43:00,724 --> 01:43:02,559
Answer the question!

1559
01:43:09,431 --> 01:43:11,034
Asked,

1560
01:43:13,470 --> 01:43:15,706
"Who do you say
that I am?"

1561
01:43:18,240 --> 01:43:20,444
And what did you answer?

1562
01:43:23,078 --> 01:43:27,050
You are the Christ,
the son of the living God.

1563
01:43:31,453 --> 01:43:33,423
Well, there you have it.

1564
01:43:35,057 --> 01:43:38,228
Your Honor, I think we've
all heard quite enough.

1565
01:43:38,261 --> 01:43:41,731
Mr. Endler, are you looking
to change your client's plea?

1566
01:43:41,765 --> 01:43:43,467
No, Your Honor.

1567
01:43:43,500 --> 01:43:46,269
I say she's innocent
of all wrongdoing.

1568
01:43:46,301 --> 01:43:49,206
But I'm asking the jury
to find against her anyway.

1569
01:43:49,238 --> 01:43:50,773
I mean, let's face it.

1570
01:43:50,806 --> 01:43:55,045
She has the audacity to believe
not only that there is a God,

1571
01:43:55,078 --> 01:43:57,781
but that she has a personal
relationship with him,

1572
01:43:57,814 --> 01:44:01,218
which colors everything
that she says and does.

1573
01:44:01,251 --> 01:44:03,320
I think it's time
we stop pretending

1574
01:44:03,353 --> 01:44:06,789
that we can trust a person like
this to serve in a public capacity.

1575
01:44:06,823 --> 01:44:10,660
In the name of tolerance and
diversity, I say we destroy her.

1576
01:44:10,693 --> 01:44:12,295
That's enough, Mr. Endler.

1577
01:44:12,328 --> 01:44:14,498
Then we can all go
to our graves content,

1578
01:44:14,530 --> 01:44:16,688
knowing we stomped out
the last spark of faith

1579
01:44:16,689 --> 01:44:18,801
that was ever exhibited
in the public square.

1580
01:44:18,835 --> 01:44:21,203
-That's enough.
-I say we make an example of her.

1581
01:44:21,237 --> 01:44:23,140
Mr. Endler,
that's enough.

1582
01:44:23,172 --> 01:44:25,307
Let's set a new precedent,

1583
01:44:25,341 --> 01:44:27,310
that employment by our
federal government mandates

1584
01:44:27,342 --> 01:44:30,046
that you must first denounce
any belief system you have.

1585
01:44:30,079 --> 01:44:32,048
Mr. Endler,
you are out of order!

1586
01:44:32,082 --> 01:44:35,786
And if someone slips through the
cracks and hides their beliefs,

1587
01:44:35,819 --> 01:44:38,388
then we arrest them
and fine them.

1588
01:44:38,421 --> 01:44:42,525
And if they don't pay, then we seize
their property. And if they resist?

1589
01:44:42,559 --> 01:44:43,882
Well, let's not kid ourselves.

1590
01:44:43,883 --> 01:44:46,529
Enforcement is always
at the end of a gun.

1591
01:44:46,563 --> 01:44:50,100
Mr. Endler, you are out of order!
I charge you with contempt!

1592
01:44:50,132 --> 01:44:52,152
I accept the charge,
because I have nothing

1593
01:44:52,153 --> 01:44:53,804
but contempt for
these proceedings.

1594
01:44:53,837 --> 01:44:56,744
If we're going to insist
that a Christian's right

1595
01:44:56,745 --> 01:44:59,476
to believe is subordinate
to all other rights,

1596
01:44:59,509 --> 01:45:01,545
then it's not a right.

1597
01:45:01,578 --> 01:45:04,414
Somebody is always
going to be offended.

1598
01:45:04,447 --> 01:45:07,317
Two thousand years
of human history proves that.

1599
01:45:07,350 --> 01:45:09,186
So I say we get on with it.

1600
01:45:09,219 --> 01:45:12,122
Cite the law, charge the jury,
and send them off to deliberate.

1601
01:45:12,154 --> 01:45:13,724
So be it!

1602
01:45:18,127 --> 01:45:21,664
Now, we are gonna bypass
the usual closing arguments,

1603
01:45:21,698 --> 01:45:25,402
unless Mr. Kane finds the need
to further address the jury.

1604
01:45:25,435 --> 01:45:27,471
No, Your Honor.

1605
01:45:27,503 --> 01:45:30,372
We can ask nothing more.

1606
01:45:30,405 --> 01:45:33,710
My instructions to you
are simple.

1607
01:45:33,743 --> 01:45:38,347
Uphold the law without unfairly
prejudicing your decision

1608
01:45:38,381 --> 01:45:42,152
or risking a mistrial
on appeal.

1609
01:45:42,185 --> 01:45:45,388
Now, I believe
I can safely say

1610
01:45:45,421 --> 01:45:48,891
that the respondent's counsel

1611
01:45:48,925 --> 01:45:50,726
has dared you...

1612
01:45:52,395 --> 01:45:54,398
to convict
his own client.

1613
01:45:57,734 --> 01:46:01,571
The jury will now be
dismissed for deliberation.

1614
01:46:01,604 --> 01:46:03,673
We are adjourned.

1615
01:46:10,712 --> 01:46:13,216
She hasn't got a prayer.

1616
01:46:14,317 --> 01:46:15,685
Let's go.

1617
01:46:17,953 --> 01:46:20,756
Remind me to send him
a thank-you note.

1618
01:47:27,023 --> 01:47:29,993
Thank you so much. Thank you,
guys. Thanks for coming out.

1619
01:47:30,025 --> 01:47:34,396
Hey, right now on the phone, a friend
of mine named Amy is on the line,

1620
01:47:34,430 --> 01:47:38,969
and she's calling about a woman
who's on trial for her faith.

1621
01:47:39,002 --> 01:47:43,807
This woman has risked
everything for Jesus.

1622
01:47:43,840 --> 01:47:48,612
Amy's asked me to pray for this
woman. Will you guys join me?

1623
01:47:48,645 --> 01:47:52,415
Lord, we know that
to risk anything for you

1624
01:47:52,448 --> 01:47:56,619
is a complete honor
with eternal rewards.

1625
01:47:56,653 --> 01:47:58,755
But if it's
within your will,

1626
01:47:58,787 --> 01:48:02,891
can you please restore
this woman's hope

1627
01:48:02,925 --> 01:48:08,297
<i>and make her faith
an example to all of us?</i>

1628
01:48:08,331 --> 01:48:11,668
<i>Lord, show your power
to a fallen world.</i>

1629
01:48:11,701 --> 01:48:16,640
<i>We know you have the power
to do anything.</i>

1630
01:48:16,672 --> 01:48:20,743
<i>So we ask you right now, crying
out as the body of Christ,</i>

1631
01:48:20,777 --> 01:48:24,747
<i>move those hearts of those people,
Lord, the judge and the jury,</i>

1632
01:48:24,780 --> 01:48:28,851
to let them know the beauty
of your majesty.

1633
01:48:28,885 --> 01:48:30,604
And we all said amen.

1634
01:48:30,605 --> 01:48:32,322
Amen.

1635
01:48:32,354 --> 01:48:34,023
Amen.

1636
01:49:05,621 --> 01:49:08,759
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
have you reached a decision?

1637
01:49:10,493 --> 01:49:11,895
We have, Your Honor.

1638
01:49:17,399 --> 01:49:19,036
And how do you find?

1639
01:49:24,841 --> 01:49:27,678
We, the jury,
find in favor of...

1640
01:49:29,811 --> 01:49:31,581
Grace Wesley.

1641
01:49:38,154 --> 01:49:39,589
-You're wrong!
-You're wrong!

1642
01:49:49,164 --> 01:49:50,766
We are adjourned.

1643
01:50:01,877 --> 01:50:03,512
Nice shoes.

1644
01:50:25,568 --> 01:50:26,903
Grace.

1645
01:50:28,604 --> 01:50:31,408
I'm sorry.
I couldn't tell you.

1646
01:50:31,440 --> 01:50:33,615
It had to come as a
surprise, otherwise the jury

1647
01:50:33,616 --> 01:50:35,612
wouldn't have been
swayed by your reactions.

1648
01:50:35,645 --> 01:50:38,448
So you did have a plan.

1649
01:50:39,582 --> 01:50:41,852
No. You did.

1650
01:50:42,984 --> 01:50:45,054
You stood up
for what you believed in

1651
01:50:45,087 --> 01:50:47,056
and you held on
to your faith.

1652
01:50:47,088 --> 01:50:50,126
I don't know anybody
that would have done that.

1653
01:50:50,158 --> 01:50:52,761
They were hoping to
make an example of you,

1654
01:50:52,795 --> 01:50:55,132
but instead you became
an inspiration.

1655
01:50:57,867 --> 01:51:00,136
We did it!

1656
01:51:00,168 --> 01:51:03,506
Hey, you've kept
quiet long enough.

1657
01:51:03,538 --> 01:51:06,475
Why don't you go
share the good news?

1658
01:51:08,944 --> 01:51:10,146
Hey.

1659
01:51:13,114 --> 01:51:14,751
Thank you.

1660
01:51:14,783 --> 01:51:16,853
Yeah.

1661
01:52:02,864 --> 01:52:04,132
God's not dead!

1662
01:52:34,262 --> 01:52:37,266
<i>A case that was turning
for the worse was concluded</i>

1663
01:52:37,300 --> 01:52:40,270
<i>with a powerful happy ending
for Ms. Grace Wesley.</i>

1664
01:52:40,302 --> 01:52:42,793
<i>Live outside the courthouse
here in Hope Springs...</i>

1665
01:52:42,794 --> 01:52:44,039
Father. You did it!

1666
01:52:46,007 --> 01:52:48,744
God is good!

1667
01:52:48,778 --> 01:52:51,280
Wait.
I want to hear this.

1668
01:52:51,314 --> 01:52:55,118
<i>In the case of Thawley v. Wesley, they
have ruled in favor of Grace Wesley.</i>

1669
01:52:55,150 --> 01:52:58,086
<i>The crowd is in full celebration
here at Hope Springs.</i>

1670
01:52:58,119 --> 01:53:00,323
So are you gonna say it,
or should I?

1671
01:53:00,355 --> 01:53:01,990
Say what?

1672
01:53:02,024 --> 01:53:03,826
God is good.

1673
01:53:03,859 --> 01:53:05,728
All the time.

1674
01:53:05,761 --> 01:53:08,331
-And all the time...
-God is good.

1675
01:53:08,363 --> 01:53:10,232
Amen, brother.

1676
01:53:38,226 --> 01:53:39,779
I'll get to work
on the appeal.

1677
01:53:39,780 --> 01:53:41,331
Don't bother.

1678
01:53:41,363 --> 01:53:45,300
If we appeal and lose, it'll set
a precedent. I don't want that.

1679
01:53:45,333 --> 01:53:46,969
I don't understand
how we lost this.

1680
01:53:46,970 --> 01:53:48,604
Outsmarted us.

1681
01:53:48,637 --> 01:53:51,707
Played our role
in attacking Wesley.

1682
01:53:51,740 --> 01:53:54,210
Made the jury
hate everyone but her.

1683
01:53:54,243 --> 01:53:57,013
Not to mention proved the
existence of Jesus Christ.

1684
01:54:06,389 --> 01:54:09,292
<i>-God's not dead!
-He's surely alive!</i>

1685
01:54:13,295 --> 01:54:16,132
God's not dead!
He's surely alive!

1686
01:54:16,164 --> 01:54:17,633
God's not dead!
He's surely alive!

1687
01:54:17,634 --> 01:54:19,101
Come on!

1688
01:54:19,135 --> 01:54:21,838
God's not dead!
He's surely alive!

1689
01:54:21,871 --> 01:54:25,208
God's not dead!
He's surely alive!

1690
01:54:25,240 --> 01:54:27,810
God's not dead!
He's surely alive!

1691
01:54:27,842 --> 01:54:30,947
God's not dead!
He's surely alive!

1692
01:54:30,979 --> 01:54:33,949
God's not dead!
He's surely alive!

1693
01:59:16,631 --> 01:59:18,383
You know I'm gonna
need my keys back.

1694
01:59:18,384 --> 01:59:20,135
I know.

1695
01:59:20,168 --> 01:59:22,637
Two days of ice chips.
I'm starving.

1696
01:59:22,671 --> 01:59:25,474
I'm hungry as well,
David.

1697
01:59:25,506 --> 01:59:28,210
How about I take you
for a nice tuna melt?

1698
01:59:28,243 --> 01:59:29,412
David Hill?

1699
01:59:29,413 --> 01:59:30,580
Yes.

1700
01:59:32,113 --> 01:59:34,049
You're under arrest.

1701
01:59:35,417 --> 01:59:36,886
For what?

1702
01:59:36,887 --> 01:59:38,354
Contempt of court.

1703
01:59:38,386 --> 01:59:40,956
You failed to produce your
sermons upon court order.

1704
01:59:40,989 --> 01:59:42,646
Please put your hands
behind your back.

1705
01:59:42,647 --> 01:59:43,391
Please be gentle.

1706
01:59:43,425 --> 01:59:45,661
He's just been released
from the hospital.

1707
01:59:45,694 --> 01:59:47,964
I don't understand. What
is being accused of?

1708
01:59:47,997 --> 01:59:49,699
You have the right
to remain silent.

1709
01:59:49,731 --> 01:59:52,600
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

1710
01:59:52,634 --> 01:59:54,251
You have a right to an attorney.

1711
01:59:54,252 --> 01:59:56,972
If you cannot afford an attorney,
one will be provided.

1712
01:59:57,006 --> 02:00:00,610
Do you understand the rights I
have just read to you? -Yes.

1713
02:00:07,248 --> 02:00:08,617
Sorry about this,
Pastor.

1714
02:00:08,649 --> 02:00:11,186
It's okay.

1715
02:00:11,220 --> 02:00:14,190
Looks like I'm gonna need you to fill
in for me a little while longer.

1716
02:00:14,222 --> 02:00:16,725
Of course, David.
Anything you need.

1717
02:00:22,030 --> 02:00:24,367
What do we do now?

1718
02:00:24,399 --> 02:00:26,101
Same as always,
Martin.

1719
02:00:26,135 --> 02:00:28,704
We pray, in faith.
