00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,238
<i>For as long as I can remember...</i>

2
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,279
<i>... my grandmother and her friends</i>
<i>have been part of a quilting bee.</i>

3
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,348
<i>I remember sitting under the quilting frame</i>
<i>pretending that I was surrounded...</i>

4
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:13,432
<i>... by a forest of friendly trees,</i>
<i>and that their stitches...</i>

5
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,910
<i>... were messages from giants</i>
<i>written across the sky.</i>

6
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,436
<i>I used to spend my summers</i>
<i>with my grandmother and my great-aunt...</i>

7
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,398
<i>... who lived in Grasse, California.</i>

8
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:28,473
<i>My mother would dump me there</i>
<i>when she took off with her latest boyfriend.</i>

9
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,673
<i>My parents' marriage didn't last very long.</i>

10
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,155
<i>They said they didn't love each other anymore.</i>

11
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,959
<i>Or maybe they were just afraid</i>
<i>that their relationship...</i>

12
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,076
<i>... had become just like everyone else's.</i>

13
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:46,756
<i>They eventually parted as friends,</i>
<i>and I eventually stopped thinking...</i>

14
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,592
<i>... it was all my fault.</i>

15
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,834
<i>The truth is, it's no one's fault.</i>

16
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,229
<i>Sometimes love simply dies.</i>

17
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,918
<i>At this moment in time,</i>
<i>I'm working on my third...</i>

18
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,037
<i>... and, I hope, final attempt</i>
<i>at my master's thesis.</i>

19
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:12,317
<i>Whenever I'm about to finish,</i>
<i>I decide to switch topics.</i>

20
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,435
<i>I can't help it.</i>

21
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,715
<i>It seems the more I know about something...</i>

22
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,435
<i>... well, the less I want to know about it.</i>

23
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:26,429
<i>On top of that, my sweetheart Sam</i>
<i>is taking our home apart...</i>

24
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,796
<i>... and putting it back together</i>
<i>in some mysterious new form.</i>

25
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,799
<i>I've decided to go away for the summer.</i>

26
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,791
<i>This makes Sam nervous.</i>

27
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,075
<i>He thinks I'm leaving</i>
<i>because last night he proposed to me.</i>

28
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,070
<i>Sam's great and I really love him.</i>

29
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:46,948
<i>And I'm 26. This is not</i>
<i>an unreasonable age to get married.</i>

30
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,316
<i>Especially if you've found</i>
<i>your possible soul mate.</i>

31
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:03,316
<i>But how do you merge into this thing</i>
<i>called a couple...</i>

32
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,119
<i>... and still keep a little room for yourself?</i>

33
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:09,670
<i>And how do we even know</i>
<i>if we're only supposed to be with one person...</i>

34
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,796
<i>... for the rest of our lives?</i>

35
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:29,279
<i>The day Sam drove me</i>
<i>to my Great-aunt Glady's house...</i>

36
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,716
<i>... the Grasse Quilting Bee was there,</i>
<i>setting up to make a new quilt.</i>

37
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,279
I don't know why we do this...

38
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,430
<i>They've always met here at Aunt Glady's.</i>

39
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,717
<i>My grandmother moved in</i>
<i>after she lost her husband.</i>

40
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,071
<i>They've been fighting ever since.</i>

41
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,799
Arthur's stuff is junk?
It's piled up there.

42
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,839
<i>Everyone defers to Anna,</i>
<i>who is the master quilter.</i>

43
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:53,198
<i>She used to work for my Aunt Glady,</i>
<i>but these days it seems they're working for her.</i>

44
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,111
<i>My least favorite is Sophia.</i>

45
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:59,158
<i>When I was a little girl, she always made me cry.</i>

46
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,750
<i>And then there's Em, who's married to an artist,</i>
<i>and for some reason...</i>

47
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,990
<i>... that makes everyone feel sorry for her.</i>

48
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,795
<i>I always idolized Anna's daughter Marianna.</i>

49
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,233
We have to move this.

50
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:12,357
<i>She had lived in Paris</i>
<i>which made her very mysterious to me...</i>

51
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,509
<i>... when I was a kid.</i>

52
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,439
<i>She taught me French, made café au laits.</i>

53
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:19,876
<i>And the year I got my period,</i>
<i>she gave me a glass of red wine.</i>

54
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,440
Sam, I'm so happy to see you.
Thank you.

55
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,239
Let's move some furniture together.
Sure.

56
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,029
Now I'm not lifting anything else.
I'll do whatever, but no lifting.

57
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:34,272
Shouldn't you be using a computer?
I don't trust computers.

58
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,238
- They lose things.
- Not if you know what you're doing.

59
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,436
- Sophia!
- What?

60
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,552
I made you a tape.

61
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,395
- All the songs have "road" in the title.
- Great. Thanks.

62
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,755
Are you gonna be okay with this?
Yeah, I'm fine.

63
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,874
I got lots to do, so, I'm fine.

64
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,033
So you'll come pick me up in September?

65
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,188
Maybe.

66
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,028
- Maybe not.
- You better.

67
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,152
'Bye.
'Bye.

68
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,914
<i>The challenge with a quilt like this is...</i>

69
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,310
...each of these squares
is made by different hands.

70
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:40,712
So I have to bring
all these different squares together...

71
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,793
...in a balanced and harmonious...

72
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,269
...design.

73
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,034
First, we have to find a theme.

74
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:57,998
Now, for this particular quilt,
the theme is "Where Love Resides."

75
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,710
You put too much sugar in the iced tea.

76
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,429
I did not. It's got like a teaspoon and a half.

77
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:07,034
You put in a whole cup. I can taste it.

78
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,599
Give it a rest, will you?

79
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:11,399
Bicker, bicker, bicker, makes a gal age quicker.

80
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:14,552
What you're saying is,
by harmonizing all different elements...

81
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:17,200
<i>... you're creating kind of</i>
<i>a continuity in the piece?</i>

82
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,589
No. What I'm saying is...

83
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,514
...I don't want to end up
with some damn ugly quilt.

84
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,436
Sweetie, explain to us again
what kind of a book this is you're writing.

85
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:35,193
It's not a book. It's a thesis.

86
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:39,109
I'm looking at women's handiwork
in various tribal cultures...

87
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,872
...and I'm showing that how...

88
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,111
<i>... making a basket, or a blanket,</i>
<i>or a digging stick, or whatever...</i>

89
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,236
<i>... it's all done with a sense of ritual.</i>

90
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:49,073
I thought you were writing
something about the Victorians.

91
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,316
No, that was a different thesis.

92
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:55,194
- What happened to that one?
- I just became more interested in this subject.

93
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,669
- You didn't finish it?
- No.

94
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,637
Well, why not?

95
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,125
Chill, Sophia.

96
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:04,869
By the way, I spotted a fellow for Anna.

97
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,237
Does anybody know Frank Ipsey
who comes by here with the eggs?

98
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,276
Glady, Frank has cancer.

99
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,840
So you got me a sick one, too.

100
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,152
Finn, when are you gonna start having babies?

101
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,197
- My God, I don't know.
- Are you using protection?

102
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,629
Sophia!

103
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,269
Sophia, you filth-monger,
leave my grandniece alone.

104
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:41,037
So, this quilt you're working on, is this
something you're making for the state fair?

105
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,958
It's your wedding quilt, honey.

106
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,196
"Here comes the bride"

107
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,276
Grandma, do you mind if I play some music?

108
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,588
Hell, no.

109
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,199
Hey, Finn.

110
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,553
Hey, Constance.

111
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,350
- Sorry I'm late.
- Quite all right.

112
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,158
You want a smoke?

113
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,635
No, I don't think I'd better.

114
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,958
The hell if I know where love resides.

115
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:16,754
I don't know why your mother divorced
your father and then stayed friends with him.

116
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,589
If you still love each other,
why don't you just stay married?

117
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:24,275
Some people like to get a new car
every other year.

118
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,359
Here you go.

119
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:34,398
Oh, Hy, look what you did.

120
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,876
Well, we're all family.

121
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:40,200
You know,
when your mother and father got married...

122
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,918
<i>... they were very immature.</i>

123
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,638
Which isn't the same case with you and Sam.

124
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,597
You know what Mom said to me once?

125
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,835
- She's so crazy. How'd she get so crazy?
- Don't look at me.

126
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:58,079
She said that as soon as I get married,
I'm gonna want to have an affair.

127
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,197
She doesn't know what she's talking about.

128
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:04,710
That which is forbidden...

129
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,391
Don't be such a cynic.

130
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,148
I'm not.

131
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,232
My grandniece wants to know...

132
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,437
...why the marriage vow
is considered such a sacred thing...

133
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:19,354
...when, in fact,
to most people it means nothing at all.

134
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,829
I took my marriage very seriously.

135
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:28,311
You were too young to remember
your grandpa, but he and I had...

136
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,119
<i>... a very special love for each other.</i>

137
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,350
Which I'm sure even your Aunt Gladiola
was aware of.

138
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,872
Very much aware.

139
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:44,312
That's what made the whole thing so stunning.

140
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,356
Why are you bringing this up right now?

141
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,673
You brought it up.

142
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,320
Fine. You want to tell her?
Tell her. I don't care.

143
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,628
Tell me what?

144
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:59,509
Was this a mistake, letting you smoke?
Oh, no, sweetie.

145
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,511
If I weren't a little high right now...

146
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,160
...Id have your aunt on the floor,
beating her senseless.

147
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,872
- You're gonna need a lot more than that.
- Shut up.

148
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:32,477
All right, I'll tell you what happened.

149
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,713
But I'd like to say one thing first,
with your aunt's permission.

150
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,719
Be my guest.

151
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:48,080
When you've spent your life with someone...

152
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,438
...and they start to die...

153
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:58,116
...and you feel this terrible, terrible...

154
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,229
...severing.

155
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:13,354
So you do things without thinking...

156
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,109
<i>... because what you have to face is so...</i>

157
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,958
<i>... deeply unthinkable.</i>

158
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,991
Could I use your phone, please?

159
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,189
Arthur Cleary.

160
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:16,312
<i>Arthur, where's Glady?</i>
<i>I called your house and she didn't answer.</i>

161
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,311
Hy, is that you?
<i>Yes.</i>

162
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,799
What's wrong?

163
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,074
<i>Is Glady with you?</i>

164
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:26,633
No. She must be out shopping. James didn't...

165
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:33,031
No, he's still here, I just...

166
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:39,673
I need someone to come pick me up.

167
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:56,279
I've got to get back to the office soon.

168
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,949
- What if I take you to our house?
- No.

169
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,712
All right. Okay.

170
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:05,109
I have to lie down before I go back.

171
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:10,435
You know, find me a tree.
I need some peace before I go back.

172
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:15,510
I was at the hospital today.
James didn't know where you had gone.

173
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,036
I told him you had to go to town
for something. He was quite upset.

174
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,111
I know. He told me.

175
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:26,990
I just find it odd that you just left the hospital
without even leaving him a note.

176
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:30,277
That you just took off
for a ride with my husband.

177
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,396
Glady, what are you doing?

178
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,556
Honey, what are you doing?

179
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,308
Come on.

180
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,159
Glady!

181
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:11,793
I don't want to hear a word out of either of you!

182
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,631
You stink of her perfume!

183
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,994
Oh, shit.

184
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,159
Glady?

185
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,749
<i>Glady?</i>

186
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,591
Can't we work this out?

187
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,230
If you want me to go away, I'll do it.

188
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,788
<i>But if you want me to stay, that's what I want.</i>

189
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,113
What's happened to our marriage?

190
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,476
I mean, it's been so long
since we even shared the same bed.

191
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,428
It's been hard on me, sugar.
What do you want me to do?

192
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,750
She's my sister!

193
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,071
She's my sister!

194
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,959
Glady?

195
00:17:58,760 --> 00:17:59,954
Oh, sweetheart.

196
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,549
Glady?

197
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,718
What the hell are you doing?

198
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,997
I'm trying to find something I haven't smashed.

199
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,831
Honey, I'm going to work now.

200
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,272
As you wish, dear.

201
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:56,550
Sweetheart, this is really
kind of creepy, you know.

202
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,550
Can't you just toss all that junk out?

203
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,350
Self-expression heals the wounded heart.

204
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,073
Glady, for God's sake.

205
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,310
Here, you can iron your own.

206
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,798
Glady...

207
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:31,559
- Aren't you ever going to forgive me?
- You made your own bed.

208
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,350
Don't you understand why I did it?

209
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,670
Frankly, the reason eludes me.

210
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,390
Your sister was the closest...

211
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,758
...I could get to you.

212
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,597
Get out! Get out!

213
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:56,150
You must have been angry
for a really long time.

214
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:01,516
Your grandmother won't come in here,
so I'm stuck with doing all the laundry.

215
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:05,116
Did Grandpa ever find out?

216
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,354
I had decided to tell him everything.

217
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,030
<i>Let the man die enlightened.</i>

218
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,592
<i>I was crazy, Finn.</i>

219
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,079
<i>I would've done anything.</i>

220
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,628
<i>Dr. Walton,</i>
<i>please call the operator.</i>

221
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,549
Sweetheart.

222
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,239
<i>That's my darling.</i>

223
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,752
I brought ice cream.

224
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,629
Thank you.

225
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,835
Did you ever forgive Uncle Arthur?

226
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,911
Yeah. I forgave him.

227
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:12,236
That's what you do when someone dies.

228
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,355
Did you ever forgive Grandma?

229
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,109
Well...

230
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,436
I let her move in with me.

231
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:27,637
That is not necessarily the same thing.

232
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,428
I'm sleepy. I'm going to bed.

233
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,478
<i>- '</i>Night.
- Good night, honey.

234
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:42,675
Yeah.

235
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:48,994
By the way, it was so good of you to take me in.

236
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,918
Good night, dear.

237
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:18,276
Honey, it's too hot to work.
Come on. Come swimming with us.

238
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,269
Good girl.

239
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,271
I just have to grab my bathing suit.

240
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,828
"Baby, love me

241
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,831
"Yes, yes she does

242
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:39,239
"Ah the girl's outta sight, yeah

243
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,799
"Says she loves me

244
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,791
"Yes, yes she does"

245
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,069
Come on.

246
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,988
"Gonna show me tonight, yeah

247
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:53,274
"She got the way to move me, Cherry

248
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,749
"She got the way to groove me

249
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,957
"She got the way to move me

250
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:58,836
"Cherry baby

251
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,751
"She got the way to groove me"

252
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:12,480
Look at that. That old dog.

253
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:21,990
- Dean, I'm watching you.
- Just talking, Glady. Just talking.

254
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,150
Just talking. Just talking, my foot.

255
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,433
Nice 'do.
Hi.

256
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:29,876
Cute hair, Em.
Em, you look beautiful.

257
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,470
Just imagine what he's talking about.

258
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,598
There you go.
Thank you.

259
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,193
You're welcome.

260
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,758
Oh, man, what's going on?

261
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,192
What is he doing up there?

262
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,998
I've been standing here...

263
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,275
<i>It seems it's been about 15 minutes.</i>

264
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:58,676
You know what I just did?
I just did 30 laps doing the butterfly stroke.

265
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,955
- You know what my arms feel like right now?
- No.

266
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,634
They feel like I could take off and fly.

267
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:10,039
- So are you in training?
- Yeah. I'm gonna be an ocean swimmer.

268
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,235
Yeah?

269
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,838
What's your name?

270
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,069
Finn.

271
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,513
Like on a fish?

272
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:24,396
No, with a double "n."
It's one of those weird hippie names.

273
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,312
No, it's a beautiful name.

274
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,029
<i>Finn.</i>

275
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:31,196
<i>That's the thing that slices through the water.</i>

276
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:33,794
<i>That's the thing</i>
<i>that gives the fishes their speed.</i>

277
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,275
Finn.

278
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:43,833
Why have I never seen you here before?
I'm just here for the summer.

279
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,871
- You're from the city.
- Berkeley.

280
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,396
- Where the smart people live.
- Not really.

281
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,516
I can tell you're one of them.

282
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,470
- Long line.
- Yeah.

283
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:14,518
You know, I'm really hot.
I'm gonna go jump in the water.

284
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,513
My name's Leon.

285
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,554
Okay, Leon. See you later.

286
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,430
Hey, you want to go in the deep end?

287
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:41,030
- Who was that young man we saw you with?
- Just someone who wanted to talk.

288
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,153
Little girls!

289
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,118
That's not allowed!

290
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:01,352
- Sophia is still scaring children.
- That's how she lives so long.

291
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,675
You should've seen her when she was your age.

292
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,748
My God, she had a stunning figure.

293
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,795
Well!

294
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,797
I'm Preston Richards.

295
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,999
What's your name?

296
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,554
Sophia.

297
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:12,954
Sophia.

298
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,389
Sophia Darling.

299
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:19,951
- Did you say "darling"?
- Yeah. Like the family in <i>Peter Pan.</i>

300
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,355
I thought...

301
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,714
I thought that...

302
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,515
What?

303
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:28,878
I thought that you called me darling.

304
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,996
- Oh, God, no.
- "Oh, God, no."

305
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,069
I like your name. I like it very much.

306
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,549
Do you now?

307
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,353
When we marry,
we'll break tradition so you can keep it.

308
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,270
Excuse me?

309
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,793
Do you dive competitively?

310
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,269
No.

311
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,038
I just do it for myself.

312
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:48,475
I like the sensation of falling.

313
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,031
You swim like a mermaid, you know.

314
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,189
I do?

315
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,710
So, what do you want to do with your life?

316
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,519
I don't know.

317
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,068
Marry you, I guess.

318
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:08,872
<i>A college boy, that's good.</i>

319
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:12,916
But listen, honey,
you let him do most of the talking.

320
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:17,917
Men, especially smart men,
they like a good listener.

321
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,679
Ma, don't!

322
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:22,156
It's all right to shine a little, though.

323
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:25,718
Men like to think
that they've found a treasure.

324
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:32,077
- It's only a date. I'm not gonna marry him.
- You never know.

325
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:34,230
You never know if this is the one.

326
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:37,398
I love you, baby,
but you're just not pretty enough...

327
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,152
...to be on your own.

328
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,270
Good night.
Good night, Mrs. Darling.

329
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,920
These bugs
are gonna eat you alive.

330
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:53,350
You keep your delicate parts covered.

331
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,759
I'll get my door.

332
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:57,229
It's a hotsy-totsy night tonight.

333
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:00,280
I made a dinner reservation for 7:30.
Is that all right?

334
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,634
I've got a better idea.

335
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:02,869
Be careful!

336
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,394
Good night, Preston.

337
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,676
This is where I usually come to swim.

338
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,395
You like it?

339
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:08,358
I'm a geologist. I mean, that's my major. Rocks.

340
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:11,955
God! I'm sorry, I didn't even ask.
No, that's all right.

341
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:14,838
No, I shouldn't have been doing
all the talking.

342
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,113
So tell me more.

343
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:25,353
Well, all right.

344
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,119
This is what I'd like to do.

345
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:30,590
I'd like to travel over the whole planet,
and study every part of her.

346
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:32,716
Especially where rock is met up with water.

347
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:35,314
That's where you get
the most spectacular effects.

348
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,356
That's when you get the Grand Canyon.

349
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,193
There's nothing like water
to wear down a mountain...

350
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,998
<i>... and open up its secrets to you.</i>

351
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,394
You know, in Arizona they...

352
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,515
Stay right there.

353
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,153
Don't move.

354
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,391
Let's go around the world together.

355
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,113
I'll study rocks.

356
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,395
You can swim down to the bottom of canyons.

357
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,675
Swim across the middle of old volcanoes.

358
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,391
Get me away from here.

359
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,996
Where you going this time?

360
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:03,638
They want to send me up to Colorado
to check out the site of a dam.

361
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:20,952
Pres, I'm not gonna raise this child alone.

362
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:23,357
You have to get a job in town.

363
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,752
Sophia, I can't spend my life
doing soil tests for farmers.

364
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:29,798
And I can't be left behind like some old bag.

365
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:36,069
Look, as soon as the baby gets a little older,
you can come along, too.

366
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:38,594
And before that,
how do I know you won't run off?

367
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:43,078
Why would I do that?

368
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,079
That's what you say now.

369
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:48,311
Sophia, this is crazy. Why would I run away?

370
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:54,873
Because it happens.

371
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:09,159
Are you gonna be away
for very long, Daddy?

372
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:12,029
Not so long, sweetheart.
Two or three weeks.

373
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:21,154
- I want to go to college.
- We can only afford to send one of you.

374
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:25,552
- It's more important for Pres Jr. to go.
- But I'm the oldest.

375
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:28,438
A girl doesn't have to go to college.
You can get married.

376
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,192
That's not what I want.

377
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:32,989
We don't always get what we want.

378
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,275
- What's that?
- It's a pond.

379
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,028
For you.

380
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,717
I thought you could wade around in it or...

381
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,589
<i>... keep fish in it, or whatever you want.</i>

382
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,911
I think it's deep enough.

383
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,673
What do you think about getting some goldfish?

384
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:33,551
Evie says she wants a goldfish.

385
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:43,269
Remember when you took me
to the swimming hole?

386
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,757
Why'd you stop going?

387
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,631
I became a wife, I guess.

388
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:09,629
Preston.

389
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,269
Pres?

390
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,431
Let's go down to the swimming hole.

391
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,315
Pres?

392
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,988
So, what happened?

393
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,877
He never came back.

394
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:18,113
Oh, look, Sam is here.
Hi.

395
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,353
Hi, Sam.

396
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:35,913
- So, how come you're here?
- I missed you.

397
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,995
I wanted to go over the house.
We've got plenty.

398
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:41,071
- Sam, are you staying to dinner?
- Sure.

399
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:42,149
Good.
Great.

400
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,912
If you'll have me.
Oh, yeah.

401
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,791
- Did you go swimming?
- Yeah.

402
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:50,551
I took this wall out here
between the kitchen and the dining room.

403
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,278
- And you see this section here?
- Yeah.

404
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:55,432
- That's for your office.
- No, I told you I want a separate room.

405
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:56,475
Yeah, I know.

406
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:59,632
I tried to work it out,
but the house really isn't big enough.

407
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:02,757
- What about this?
- That would be a guest room.

408
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:05,593
Well, screw the guests.
Let them sleep on the couch.

409
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:08,399
I just thought we should have an extra room...

410
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:11,278
...for whatever.
If we have a baby or for work space or...

411
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:14,989
- This is the baby's room?
- No, it's just a possible use of the space, is all.

412
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:17,196
You expect me to have babies right away?

413
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,791
No, I don't expect you to do anything.

414
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:23,077
You just said this is the baby's room.

415
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:28,033
Finn, we're just going over blueprints.

416
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,035
Okay.

417
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,630
Does that mean you don't want to have kids?

418
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,869
Not right now, no.

419
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,712
Do you mean not right now, or never?

420
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,800
Why is this something
I have to answer right now?

421
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:52,111
If you don't want to have kids,
we should talk about it.

422
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,839
Fine, Sam. But you know, this isn't something...

423
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:58,515
...I want to be thinking about right now.
I'm trying to finish my paper.

424
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:01,751
- You went swimming.
- So?

425
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:04,998
So, obviously, you have time
for other things besides work.

426
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,718
Oh, man, I can't...

427
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,239
I can't believe this.

428
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:11,835
- You came to spy on me?
- I can't believe this attitude you're giving me.

429
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:14,150
You were supposed to give me three months.

430
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,196
Three months to get my head together.

431
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,476
And here you are, what, two weeks later?

432
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:19,555
That's bullshit.

433
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,439
You're getting cold feet.

434
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:23,268
Oh, man.

435
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,796
You are. I can see that look on your face.

436
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,199
What look?

437
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,236
That look.

438
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:32,869
The same look your mother gets
when she's gonna dump one of her boyfriends.

439
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,758
<i>That look. Oh, please!</i>
<i>"What am I doing with a carpenter?</i>

440
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:38,035
"Why don't I get somebody better? Smarter?

441
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:42,079
- "Somebody who doesn't even care about me?"
- You are so wrong! So wrong.

442
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:44,835
Am I?

443
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:53,195
All right. Whatever. Let's just do this.

444
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:58,190
I'm not like my mother, Sam.

445
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:05,108
Okay, the extra room would be your office,
and you want...

446
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,274
Whatever.

447
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,834
<i>Want a built-in desk or shelves?</i>
<i>What do you want?</i>

448
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:12,353
I don't care.

449
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:18,513
"Doesn't care."

450
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:34,754
Will you be spending the night, Sam?

451
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:38,031
No, I don't think so.

452
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:48,994
Sam!

453
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:52,632
Don't drive crazy just 'cause you're mad at me.

454
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:21,795
<i>This is Sam.</i>
<i>This is the machine.</i>

455
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:23,279
<i>You know what to do.</i>

456
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:27,632
Hi, it's me again.

457
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:29,918
Are you there?

458
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:32,359
Are you there?

459
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:37,393
Okay, well...

460
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:39,950
...I just wanted to call and say...

461
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,354
...that I'm really...

462
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:45,751
...sorry about the fight we had.

463
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:48,713
I'm just...

464
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:52,831
...sorry for being such a horrible...

465
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:32,040
<i>Hello? Hello, who is this?</i>

466
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:34,075
Shit!

467
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,393
Hi, sleepyhead.

468
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:47,676
Wish I could stay in bed that long.

469
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:50,839
What's going on with her?

470
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:54,593
She was up all night trying to call Sam.

471
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:56,912
Some girl answered.

472
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:03,833
Oh, dear, that sounds bad.
Not necessarily.

473
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:12,071
I don't know. Everything is...

474
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:13,673
<i>I don't like any of these colors.</i>

475
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:17,150
<i>I don't like this color. I don't like that color.</i>
<i>I just can't...</i>

476
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:19,674
Try this.
I can't.

477
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,955
I don't like this, and I don't like that.

478
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:22,995
Fine.

479
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:27,909
Honey?

480
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:31,513
- May I join you?
- Yeah.

481
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:44,751
I'm sure you know about this little involvement
between my husband and...

482
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:47,672
...what's- her-name.

483
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:53,312
This isn't the first time he's fooled around. No.

484
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:57,068
Dean is not a conventional man.

485
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:01,038
He's an artist. He acts out.

486
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:07,714
He's been acting out
since the first month we were married.

487
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:11,160
Then why have you stayed with him so long?

488
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:14,718
I've lived all my life in this town...

489
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:17,511
...and being married to Dean...

490
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:20,392
...makes me feel unusual.

491
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:24,554
Oh, Dean.

492
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:38,158
Dean won't drink American coffee.

493
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:41,869
He makes us go all the way to San Francisco
to the Italian section to get it.

494
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:43,791
Where is he right now?

495
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:48,274
He's in his studio with a student.

496
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:54,158
What's that supposed to mean?

497
00:47:57,120 --> 00:48:00,271
I'd just keep my eyes on him. That's all.

498
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:03,270
You sound like your mother.

499
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:14,676
Do you love that girl?
No! No.

500
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:18,151
It was just the physical pleasure.

501
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:19,593
Dean, stop it!

502
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:23,355
I'm sorry, Em, it's... I'm an artist.
That makes me greedy and selfish.

503
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:26,110
You're a beautiful woman. I don't deserve you.

504
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:28,111
I'm a pathetic excuse for a husband.

505
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:29,428
I have to leave you.

506
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:32,838
- What?
- I can't live like this. I have to leave you.

507
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:35,957
- We have to get a divorce.
- Yeah, but I'll die.

508
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:37,075
Dean!

509
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:40,152
No, you should. You should.
You should leave me.

510
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:42,629
You can't trust me.
You should find someone new.

511
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:47,155
But I'll die if you leave me.

512
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:52,316
Dean, what are you doing? Dean!

513
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:53,230
Get away!

514
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:55,629
Please. Please. Please, forgive me, Em.

515
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:57,631
Don't leave me. Please.

516
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:01,874
Beautiful Em, I can't let you leave me.
Stay with me.

517
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:03,672
I'll paint old men.

518
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:07,594
Fat, old, bald, warty men
with all their clothes on.

519
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:09,511
Please. I love you.

520
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:34,309
I'll get it.

521
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:55,110
I do.

522
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:57,474
I need you.

523
00:49:57,560 --> 00:49:59,152
It's killing me.

524
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:02,477
You shouldn't call me here.

525
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:04,318
I know. I know.

526
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:06,870
It's hard for me, too, baby.

527
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:07,916
Oh, God!

528
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:11,117
Oh, my God, you son of a bitch!

529
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:14,749
I can't believe you're doing this!
Why do you keep doing this?

530
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:16,558
I can't control it.

531
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:22,792
You bastard!

532
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:29,755
Here.

533
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:32,712
<i>And so I left him.</i>

534
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:34,912
<i>I went to stay at my parents' house...</i>

535
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:37,356
<i>... which isn't saying much.</i>

536
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:40,269
<i>They only lived two streets away.</i>

537
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:46,111
<i>All the same, it took Dean three months</i>
<i>to find me.</i>

538
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:00,835
Em.

539
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:02,875
Em.

540
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:06,716
What are you doing here?

541
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:18,233
And what makes you think
I should ever come back to you?

542
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:23,912
This one on top.

543
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:37,316
It's for the best, dear.

544
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:41,873
Unbelievable.

545
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:50,037
I've come to believe
that Dean is more typical than not.

546
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:53,155
It's a pattern of nature.

547
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:58,116
The female keeps the nest,
while the male goes out and flaunts his feathers.

548
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:01,753
- Well, screw that.
- Heck yeah.

549
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:06,073
I've decided...

550
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:08,916
...finally, to leave him.

551
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:12,673
- Please, don't tell anyone.
- Of course not.

552
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:51,353
Our naked lady.

553
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:53,592
I beg your pardon?

554
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:57,594
Our naked lady.

555
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:14,796
Oh, turn it up. I like that song.

556
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:34,432
I don't mean to bother you.

557
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,956
I brought these for you.

558
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:38,749
Thank you.

559
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:40,951
No, I'm about to take a break.

560
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:42,758
Go ahead, sit down.

561
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:51,793
Did you grow these?

562
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:54,151
My family has a field.

563
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:57,313
<i>I just picked these.</i>
<i>They're still warm from the sun.</i>

564
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:16,795
Here.

565
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:21,111
I don't know what I'm gonna do
about that yellow patch.

566
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:24,474
It throws the whole damn balance off.

567
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:28,950
Constance, what are you doing to me?

568
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:34,752
As I understood it, the theme
is supposed to be "Where Love Resides."

569
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:37,998
For me,
love resides in Chickie's garden.

570
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:41,993
You could have put some pink and blue flowers
in Chickie's garden.

571
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:44,830
Chickie's roses were yellow.

572
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:49,310
Constance, there are a lot of colors
we all like to use...

573
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:52,039
...but we have to respect Anna's opinion.

574
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:56,796
Why are we being so strict?
It's a love quilt, for God's sake.

575
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:59,838
It's for Finn, Mama.
It's not for competition.

576
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:03,799
I don't care if it's for the First Lady
or a whore in the street.

577
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:06,189
We will follow the rules of design.

578
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:09,317
Sometimes you have to break the rules
to keep the work alive.

579
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:11,517
<i>Une couleur laide, ça n'existe pas.</i>

580
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:13,989
Don't give me that French crap.

581
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:18,873
I live with someone
who's been breaking the rules for 30 years.

582
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:23,310
And I don't come here
to have it rubbed in my face.

583
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:29,758
I show up here...

584
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:31,708
...and I sew.

585
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:38,791
You know, Constance...

586
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:41,352
<i>... Em has been a part of our group...</i>

587
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:45,353
...longer than you have, and we're in a rather...

588
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:49,551
...uncomfortable situation here.

589
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:51,999
That's fine.

590
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:54,270
I'll leave.

591
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:02,072
I really don't care.

592
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:11,789
I think the hardest part about being a woman
is having women friends.

593
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:20,515
I think the hardest part about being a woman
is not being able to just be friends with a man.

594
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:23,308
That's true.

595
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:28,711
If Howell wasn't buried here
I'd leave in a minute.

596
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:31,758
I meant to write you last year
when he died. I'm so sorry.

597
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:35,469
That's okay.
I hate those condolence notes.

598
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:38,149
Here.

599
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:41,310
You can do what you like with it.

600
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:43,470
I call it Chickie's Garden.

601
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:46,830
When we were moving around a lot...

602
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:50,435
...Howell got me Chickie to keep me company
while he was on the road.

603
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:55,352
She was a wonderful dog,
and very smart and elegant.

604
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:57,868
Wasn't a yapper.

605
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:02,552
When Howell was home the three of us
would go out for walks...

606
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:05,359
...and all the kids in the neighborhood
kept us company.

607
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:07,951
<i>Chickie made us popular.</i>

608
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:11,516
<i>And then the damn dog ate some snail bait</i>
<i>in somebody's yard...</i>

609
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:16,190
<i>... and Howell buried her</i>
<i>under a yellow rose bush in my garden.</i>

610
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:17,998
Why isn't this going in my quilt?

611
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:21,709
Because I've been spending time
with somebody else's husband.

612
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:25,315
And it's absolute nonsense...

613
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:29,995
...because Howell was the love of my life.

614
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:36,516
<i>Is it going?</i>
<i>Yeah.</i>

615
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:43,191
<i>Now, sweetheart,</i>
<i>tell the folks the secret of our marriage.</i>

616
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:50,990
<i>The real secret of our marriage</i>
<i>is that I haven't seen you 'cause...</i>

617
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:53,310
<i>... you've been on the road since we got married.</i>

618
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:56,472
<i>- Tell the folks the secret of our marriage.</i>
<i>- That is the secret.</i>

619
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:57,959
<i>Turn it off.</i>

620
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:04,433
<i>Start again.</i>
<i>Do it again. Do it again.</i>

621
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:24,992
Hi. Em told me about Howell.

622
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:26,758
I'm really sorry.

623
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:30,279
Thank you.

624
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:33,316
You all right? Anything I can do?

625
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:39,920
- You can take me dancing.
- What?

626
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:44,432
Look, I'm sorry.

627
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:47,953
Howell was a good man, and I loved him.

628
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:50,914
But he's gone now and I don't believe in grief.

629
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:53,031
How can you not believe in grief?

630
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:55,677
Either you grieve, or you don't.

631
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:58,996
Yeah.

632
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:05,878
You want me to drive you home?
No, thanks. I feel like walking.

633
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:07,919
Excuse me.

634
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:47,558
Hi. Just thought I'd drop by.
See if you needed anything done.

635
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:50,439
No, I don't think so, but come in.

636
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:03,789
The hair's still in his shaver.
I don't know what to do with it.

637
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:08,270
Do you want me to take it away for you?

638
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:16,794
- Yes, would you?
- Sure.

639
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:30,558
If you go in the bedroom,
there's some jackets and some ties.

640
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:32,278
They're laid out on the bed.

641
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:36,035
Please, take whatever you want.
I don't want to give it to the Goodwill.

642
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:37,835
Okay.

643
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:44,199
Thank you.

644
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:46,153
You're welcome.

645
01:00:50,120 --> 01:00:53,430
With Howell gone,
I was thinking maybe I'd move back East.

646
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:55,238
I miss the seasons.

647
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:01,713
Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night...

648
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:05,517
...and I wonder how exactly I got here.

649
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:10,231
Why don't you go?

650
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:13,269
Why don't you just go?

651
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:21,597
Why don't we both go?

652
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,718
Ain't dead yet.

653
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:35,032
It's getting late.

654
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:38,912
I'm kicking you out.

655
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:43,958
Good night, Dean.

656
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:46,873
God damn it.

657
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:13,397
Hi. Forgot my tool box.

658
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:18,591
Dean, are you trying to have an affair with me?

659
01:02:19,960 --> 01:02:23,077
Well, I guess I am.

660
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:27,994
If Howell were alive, I might be tempted.

661
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:29,433
What do you mean?

662
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:33,350
Because I'd have him to go home to
when I came to my senses.

663
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:40,357
I guess you just saved us both
a whole lot of trouble.

664
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:46,037
You still want Howell's jacket?
Yeah, sure.

665
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:49,195
- It's on the chair in there.
- Okay.

666
01:02:58,640 --> 01:03:00,232
<i>It's 7:45 in the evening...</i>

667
01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:03,995
<i>... and as the sun goes down outside,</i>
<i>here's an old favorite.</i>

668
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:21,715
It fits you.

669
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:30,631
Come on. It's all right.

670
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:35,190
It's okay. It's all right.

671
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:27,594
Look...

672
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:30,991
<i>... just so you know...</i>

673
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:34,075
...Im engaged to be married.

674
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:39,514
So, you just want a friendship thing?

675
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:05,709
You look very pretty, honey.
Is there a special occasion?

676
01:05:06,120 --> 01:05:08,793
I thought I'd go into town, see a movie.

677
01:05:10,080 --> 01:05:13,231
Anna was gonna bring over her quilts
to show you.

678
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:16,953
She'll be here in about 20 minutes.

679
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:20,153
- She doesn't take them out for everybody.
- That's right.

680
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:22,913
I had to twist her arm to bring them out.

681
01:05:28,320 --> 01:05:29,799
I'll get it.

682
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:33,789
Hello.

683
01:05:35,480 --> 01:05:38,278
Yes, Sam, she's right here. Just a minute.

684
01:05:39,640 --> 01:05:40,834
Thanks.

685
01:05:42,080 --> 01:05:43,559
Hello.

686
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:46,029
<i>Fine.</i>

687
01:05:46,560 --> 01:05:48,869
<i>Yeah, I tried to call you again.</i>

688
01:05:49,840 --> 01:05:51,637
<i>Where were you?</i>

689
01:05:57,440 --> 01:05:58,350
It was nothing.

690
01:05:58,440 --> 01:06:00,954
He ended up spending the night
at his brother's...

691
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:03,918
...because he had taken all the plumbing apart.

692
01:06:05,720 --> 01:06:07,836
You see, I told you it wasn't anything.

693
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:09,035
Yeah.

694
01:06:13,040 --> 01:06:14,678
Who was the girl?

695
01:06:16,120 --> 01:06:17,553
Wrong number.

696
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:20,069
He said I dialed a wrong number.

697
01:06:25,160 --> 01:06:26,639
I'll get that.

698
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:40,512
- Hi.
- Hi.

699
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:44,952
You look very pretty.
Thank you.

700
01:06:45,720 --> 01:06:48,871
Look, I'm gonna have to meet you
somewhere later.

701
01:06:52,080 --> 01:06:53,195
Okay.

702
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:58,039
I don't take these quilts out
for everybody, as you know.

703
01:06:58,120 --> 01:06:59,951
I just don't do it.
I know.

704
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:03,710
Are you looking a little different tonight?

705
01:07:08,920 --> 01:07:11,878
My Aunt Pauline
passed this quilt down to me.

706
01:07:12,080 --> 01:07:17,074
It was made by my great-great-grandmother.
She called it "The Life Before."

707
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:20,159
It's a story quilt. It's meant to be read.

708
01:07:22,040 --> 01:07:23,951
<i>When I was a little girl...</i>

709
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:27,510
<i>... my Aunt Pauline would tell me</i>
<i>the story from the quilt.</i>

710
01:07:27,720 --> 01:07:29,950
<i>How my great-grandparents met.</i>

711
01:07:31,360 --> 01:07:35,512
<i>My great-grandmother was just a young woman</i>
<i>when slavery was ending.</i>

712
01:07:36,560 --> 01:07:41,315
<i>And when she was finally free,</i>
<i>she set out to look for her parents...</i>

713
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:44,029
<i>... who had been sold off years before.</i>

714
01:07:55,400 --> 01:07:56,719
<i>One day...</i>

715
01:07:56,880 --> 01:08:00,475
<i>... after many months of travel, she saw a crow...</i>

716
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:02,790
<i>... sitting on a fence.</i>

717
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:10,673
<i>Something told her, "Follow that crow."</i>

718
01:08:23,720 --> 01:08:28,714
<i>The crow led her to a young man</i>
<i>working his acres...</i>

719
01:08:28,840 --> 01:08:31,957
<i>... and my great-grandmother,</i>
<i>she knew in her heart...</i>

720
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:35,711
<i>... that she was supposed to stop right there.</i>

721
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:42,877
<i>It seems that the search for her parents</i>
<i>had led her to the man...</i>

722
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:45,394
<i>... God had intended for her to marry.</i>

723
01:08:50,120 --> 01:08:54,398
<i>Every night, I'd listen to my Aunt Pauline</i>
<i>tell that story.</i>

724
01:08:54,680 --> 01:08:56,033
<i>And I'd think to myself:</i>

725
01:08:56,120 --> 01:09:00,318
<i>"Okay, I'm gonna keep my eyes out</i>
<i>for that crow.</i>

726
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:03,632
<i>"One day, he'll lead me to my own true love."</i>

727
01:09:06,120 --> 01:09:08,156
<i>During the Depression, we had no money...</i>

728
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:13,678
<i>... to pay for shoes or schoolbooks,</i>
<i>so my Aunt Pauline sold off the quilt...</i>

729
01:09:13,760 --> 01:09:15,910
<i>... to the woman she worked for.</i>

730
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:22,197
<i>The woman paid Aunt Pauline $12,</i>
<i>and hung our quilt on her wall.</i>

731
01:09:23,720 --> 01:09:26,393
Where did you get
this marvelous piece?

732
01:09:26,920 --> 01:09:29,753
Pauline sold it to me 10 years ago.

733
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:32,232
I got it for a steal.

734
01:09:32,360 --> 01:09:37,229
<i>I felt like whatever I knew</i>
<i>of the life before was now gone.</i>

735
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:41,199
Anna, would you serve the next course?

736
01:09:43,800 --> 01:09:46,872
Don't let that son of mine
just laze around here all summer.

737
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:48,757
<i>I expect him to do some honest work.</i>

738
01:09:48,840 --> 01:09:52,037
Don't worry.
We'll have him cleaning out the stables.

739
01:09:52,120 --> 01:09:53,519
Come on now.

740
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:56,880
We'll think of something for him to do.

741
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:06,799
Hello, Anna.

742
01:10:16,040 --> 01:10:18,076
It's okay, we can talk as equals.

743
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:21,756
I don't believe
in that servant-master sort of thing.

744
01:10:22,480 --> 01:10:24,710
You think I thought you were my master?

745
01:10:26,320 --> 01:10:27,355
No, I...

746
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:31,115
Maybe I just didn't answer you
because I wanted to be left alone.

747
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:34,794
Touché.

748
01:10:36,280 --> 01:10:37,599
Excuse me?

749
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,673
It's a French expression.

750
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:51,316
So, what are you looking at?

751
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:57,039
Pegasus, Andromeda, Cassiopeia...

752
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:00,279
...Hercules...

753
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:04,515
...the Herdsman with the star Arcturus
in his knee, and...

754
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:12,749
Sorry.

755
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:16,874
You cold?

756
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:19,034
I'm okay.

757
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:23,995
I once took my coat off,
and put it around this girl...

758
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:29,077
...and she told me she could feel
the heat from my body...

759
01:11:30,160 --> 01:11:31,559
...still in the lining.

760
01:11:36,360 --> 01:11:37,759
You feel it?

761
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:41,191
Yeah, it's there.

762
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,309
You ever been with a boy before?

763
01:12:05,960 --> 01:12:07,279
<i>This okay?</i>

764
01:12:15,680 --> 01:12:17,033
You scared?

765
01:12:17,880 --> 01:12:19,108
Of what?

766
01:12:44,280 --> 01:12:46,350
This is your quilt now, Anna.

767
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:49,918
And you must tell the stories to your child.

768
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:55,115
Won't you get in trouble?
I'll pay her back the money.

769
01:12:56,800 --> 01:13:00,110
<i>It was arranged for me to stay</i>
<i>with the Rubens family...</i>

770
01:13:00,200 --> 01:13:04,955
<i>... where I would do housework and mending</i>
<i>while I waited for the birth of my baby.</i>

771
01:13:05,360 --> 01:13:10,480
<i>And it was there that I first met</i>
<i>your Grandma Hy, and your Aunt Glady Joe.</i>

772
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:12,632
Hy, Glady Joe...

773
01:13:13,320 --> 01:13:15,709
...the church has sent us over another girl.

774
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:19,757
She will be staying with us until it's her time.

775
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:24,471
And, as usual, I expect both of
you to treat her with kindness and tolerance.

776
01:13:26,520 --> 01:13:29,956
Now, Anna is a Negro
so we must be especially nice to her.

777
01:13:30,040 --> 01:13:33,396
Hyacinth, would you
put down the magazine, please?

778
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:36,148
Quit it.

779
01:13:37,160 --> 01:13:40,038
Glady Joe, why don't you show Anna her room?

780
01:13:56,840 --> 01:13:59,308
Anna, it's Glady Joe. Are you in there?

781
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:06,430
I was wondering if you'd ever read this.
It's called <i>Wuthering Heights.</i>

782
01:14:06,520 --> 01:14:09,557
Would you like to borrow it?
It's the best book I've ever read.

783
01:14:12,120 --> 01:14:13,348
Oh, my gosh!

784
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:14,839
This is very artistic.

785
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:18,635
How long have you been doing this?
All my family's women quilt.

786
01:14:19,880 --> 01:14:21,996
Gee, I'd love to learn how to do that.

787
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:28,558
Hy plays the piano, but I haven't, as yet,
found an outlet for my artistic expression.

788
01:14:33,800 --> 01:14:36,997
I've been reading about injustice and slavery
in America...

789
01:14:37,080 --> 01:14:39,435
...and it just makes me want to cry.

790
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:42,273
Everyone says how great
Thomas Jefferson was...

791
01:14:42,360 --> 01:14:44,828
<i>... but he owned slaves just like the rest of them.</i>

792
01:14:44,920 --> 01:14:47,434
I brought this up with my teacher
and she says to me:

793
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:50,114
"Well, Glady Joe,
everybody owned slaves back then.

794
01:14:50,200 --> 01:14:51,758
"It was considered normal."

795
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:54,479
Can you believe that? What a dimwit!

796
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:56,676
I swear this world is filled with ignorami.

797
01:14:56,760 --> 01:15:00,036
Look, I gotta finish this quilt for my baby, and...

798
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:02,352
<i>... I'm kind of in a hurry.</i>

799
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:04,519
Oh, all right.

800
01:15:08,680 --> 01:15:10,557
I'll leave this book for you.

801
01:15:11,480 --> 01:15:13,038
Tell me how you like it.

802
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:28,235
Anna?

803
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:37,155
You're sewing crooked. Do it again.

804
01:15:47,360 --> 01:15:48,509
Glady?

805
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:50,075
Mother!

806
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:03,677
You look much better, dear.

807
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:05,752
I made this for the baby.

808
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:11,635
Now, Anna...

809
01:16:11,720 --> 01:16:15,076
<i>... some ladies from the church</i>
<i>will be coming to see you today.</i>

810
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:17,750
I'm not giving them my baby.

811
01:16:18,360 --> 01:16:20,510
I'm raising Marianna myself.

812
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:25,709
But, Anna, don't you want
what's best for the child...

813
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:27,273
Yes, ma'am.

814
01:16:28,480 --> 01:16:30,550
That's why I'm keeping her.

815
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:34,556
<i>As Marianna grew,</i>
<i>I told her the story from the quilt.</i>

816
01:16:35,080 --> 01:16:38,834
<i>And I came to realize,</i>
<i>I had become part of that story, too.</i>

817
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:41,511
<i>It wasn't the love of a husband...</i>

818
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:45,752
<i>... I was meant to find,</i>
<i>but the love of my daughter.</i>

819
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:53,911
Oh, God, look at that!

820
01:16:56,960 --> 01:16:58,951
I never liked full moons.

821
01:16:59,720 --> 01:17:03,190
<i>They give people an excuse to do foolish things.</i>

822
01:17:05,840 --> 01:17:08,957
I'm young. I'm supposed to do foolish things.

823
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:12,077
And spend the rest of your life paying for them?

824
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:18,193
It's better than spending the rest of my life
wondering what I missed.

825
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:23,759
I'd rather wonder than kick myself.

826
01:17:27,080 --> 01:17:29,275
I'd rather kick myself.

827
01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:32,429
Fine.

828
01:17:32,920 --> 01:17:37,118
You will end up with a deeply-sore backside.

829
01:19:27,480 --> 01:19:30,597
This is Eric
who made perfumes in Provence.

830
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:35,189
Michel, the Frenchman.

831
01:19:35,640 --> 01:19:37,631
Fisherman from Marseille.

832
01:19:39,280 --> 01:19:43,114
Paco. Paco raised bulls in Spain.

833
01:19:44,120 --> 01:19:48,591
Luciano, who did marvelous things
with olive oil.

834
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:54,195
I was a wild thing.

835
01:19:54,280 --> 01:19:56,430
All these men trying to tie me down.

836
01:19:56,880 --> 01:20:00,873
"Marry me," in five different languages.

837
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:07,428
I refuse to be tied down to anyone.

838
01:20:09,880 --> 01:20:11,632
Good. Good for you.

839
01:20:12,720 --> 01:20:14,278
You think so?

840
01:20:14,360 --> 01:20:17,272
Are you kidding?
To have that kind of courage?

841
01:20:17,840 --> 01:20:19,876
Especially someone from your generation.

842
01:20:21,280 --> 01:20:23,794
Really?
Yeah, what they don't tell us...

843
01:20:24,280 --> 01:20:29,274
...is that marriage is an anachronistic institution
created for the sole convenience of the father...

844
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:33,512
...who needs to pass off his daughters
over to the care of another man, like:

845
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:37,116
"Here, here, she eats too much.
Take her off my hands."

846
01:20:37,200 --> 01:20:40,510
But now that we've gotten our independence...

847
01:20:40,600 --> 01:20:44,673
...that we earn our own livings,
there's no purpose in being someone's wife.

848
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:49,115
Why can't we love
as many people as we want in a lifetime?

849
01:20:49,480 --> 01:20:54,713
Monogamy is really a very unnatural state
that's been forced on us for centuries...

850
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:56,791
...by screwed-up religious leaders...

851
01:20:56,880 --> 01:20:59,997
...who are completely out of touch
with their own sexuality.

852
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:01,673
You know what I mean?

853
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,912
Have you been talking to your fiancé
about any of this?

854
01:21:08,040 --> 01:21:10,315
All right, let me ask you this:

855
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:14,351
If you had to choose
between marrying a lover or marrying...

856
01:21:15,880 --> 01:21:19,509
...a friend, who would you chose?

857
01:21:24,680 --> 01:21:26,750
I would marry my soul mate.

858
01:21:30,240 --> 01:21:31,559
Who is it?

859
01:21:34,040 --> 01:21:36,474
He's the only man I don't have a picture of.

860
01:21:38,600 --> 01:21:40,670
<i>I don't even know his name.</i>

861
01:21:42,640 --> 01:21:44,073
<i>Mademoiselle?</i>

862
01:21:44,480 --> 01:21:45,469
<i>I was in Paris.</i>

863
01:21:45,560 --> 01:21:46,549
<i>Merci.</i>

864
01:21:46,600 --> 01:21:50,798
<i>I had just turned 30</i>
<i>and my latest love affair was over.</i>

865
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:57,155
<i>The stranger sat down at my table</i>
<i>and ordered me some cake...</i>

866
01:21:57,320 --> 01:21:59,834
<i>... while I cried into his handkerchief.</i>

867
01:22:01,080 --> 01:22:04,117
<i>Before long I told him about my broken heart...</i>

868
01:22:04,520 --> 01:22:08,991
<i>... then he told me about his poetry</i>
<i>and his thoughts on love.</i>

869
01:22:12,080 --> 01:22:14,150
<i>The afternoon became night.</i>

870
01:22:14,920 --> 01:22:19,391
<i>I knew he had somewhere else to go,</i>
<i>but I found myself...</i>

871
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:21,238
<i>... asking him to have dinner with me.</i>

872
01:22:21,320 --> 01:22:23,038
Then have dinner with me.

873
01:22:24,560 --> 01:22:28,599
Look, I already have a dinner to go to,
with my wife.

874
01:22:31,400 --> 01:22:33,470
This is what I wrote today.

875
01:22:33,560 --> 01:22:37,155
<i>As he left,</i>
<i>he gave me one of his poems.</i>

876
01:22:51,760 --> 01:22:52,829
Read it.

877
01:22:54,760 --> 01:22:56,955
"Young lovers seek perfection.

878
01:22:57,280 --> 01:23:00,556
"Old lovers learn the art
of sewing shreds together.

879
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:04,157
"And of seeing beauty
in a multiplicity of patches."

880
01:23:19,520 --> 01:23:21,272
You better get home.

881
01:23:21,800 --> 01:23:23,518
I think the weather's changing.

882
01:23:42,680 --> 01:23:43,749
Mom?

883
01:23:45,720 --> 01:23:46,835
Babe!

884
01:23:50,200 --> 01:23:52,316
Hi.
Hey.

885
01:23:52,400 --> 01:23:53,833
I thought that was you.

886
01:24:17,200 --> 01:24:18,189
What?

887
01:24:22,320 --> 01:24:25,073
Your father and I are getting remarried.

888
01:24:26,040 --> 01:24:27,155
What?

889
01:24:29,680 --> 01:24:31,796
Your father and I are getting remarried.

890
01:24:31,920 --> 01:24:33,069
Since when?

891
01:24:33,480 --> 01:24:34,469
Well...

892
01:24:34,760 --> 01:24:38,594
We ran into each other, a couple months ago...

893
01:24:38,720 --> 01:24:41,712
...and thought we'd have dinner.
You know, catch up.

894
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:45,310
It just turned into one of those...

895
01:24:45,400 --> 01:24:47,038
<i>... wild things...</i>

896
01:24:47,200 --> 01:24:49,156
...and we closed the restaurant.

897
01:24:49,240 --> 01:24:50,229
And then...

898
01:24:50,960 --> 01:24:55,431
<i>... we took a long walk and pretty soon</i>
<i>we were making out in the moonlight.</i>

899
01:24:55,520 --> 01:24:57,670
<i>Look, I got goosebumps.</i>

900
01:24:57,800 --> 01:25:00,268
- Does Grandma know?
- Yeah.

901
01:25:00,480 --> 01:25:02,516
What does she think?

902
01:25:02,840 --> 01:25:04,717
She's fine about it.

903
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:07,678
Was Dad planning
on letting me know about this?

904
01:25:07,760 --> 01:25:11,355
No. He wanted me to tell you first.
And we want you to come to the wedding.

905
01:25:12,280 --> 01:25:13,633
Thanks.

906
01:25:17,680 --> 01:25:19,875
That's an odd response.

907
01:25:20,880 --> 01:25:24,316
Well, Mom, give me a minute here.

908
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:29,639
You can't expect me to make an instant switch
after telling me my whole life...

909
01:25:29,720 --> 01:25:31,472
...what an asshole my dad is.

910
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:34,916
Honey, he was. And so was I.

911
01:25:35,640 --> 01:25:37,198
But we've forgiven each other.

912
01:25:37,480 --> 01:25:41,029
It would've been nice if you had done
this forgiving thing 20 years ago.

913
01:25:41,120 --> 01:25:43,190
We couldn't. We had to grow up a lot.

914
01:25:43,280 --> 01:25:47,319
In the meantime, I get to grow up
with you telling me that marriage is bullshit.

915
01:25:47,400 --> 01:25:49,550
I never said that.
Yes, you did.

916
01:25:49,640 --> 01:25:51,551
- You did say that, Mom.
- No.

917
01:25:51,640 --> 01:25:53,676
You did, Mom.
No, I didn't.

918
01:25:53,760 --> 01:25:56,593
We were sitting in your kitchen
a couple months ago...

919
01:25:56,680 --> 01:25:59,399
<i>... and you were pouring me that awful,</i>
<i>that Bachnia...</i>

920
01:25:59,480 --> 01:26:00,310
Bancha.

921
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:04,109
...Banachia tea and you said,
I remember your exact words...

922
01:26:04,200 --> 01:26:07,272
You said that lifetime commitments
were impossible to keep...

923
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:10,033
<i>... and that serial monogamy</i>
<i>was the only way to go.</i>

924
01:26:11,800 --> 01:26:16,316
- Why would I say such a bizarre thing?
- You say things like that all the time.

925
01:26:16,560 --> 01:26:19,996
Well, I've changed my mind.

926
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:24,592
Do you have any idea
how crazy you've made me?

927
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:28,959
- Then you shouldn't listen to me.
- It's too late.

928
01:26:30,040 --> 01:26:31,917
The imprint's been made. I'm a mess.

929
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:35,231
Give it a break. You're not a mess.

930
01:26:35,320 --> 01:26:37,550
And for a 26-year-old...

931
01:26:37,920 --> 01:26:40,195
I was a mess.

932
01:26:40,920 --> 01:26:43,229
At least you know what you want.

933
01:26:44,080 --> 01:26:45,479
No, I don't.

934
01:26:49,840 --> 01:26:53,389
Yes, you do. You're just scared.

935
01:26:54,680 --> 01:26:57,035
Maybe I've been a flake...

936
01:26:57,120 --> 01:27:00,078
...and you want to tie me up
and do a slide show of my crimes.

937
01:27:00,160 --> 01:27:04,278
Fine. But then move on and live your life.

938
01:27:10,920 --> 01:27:11,989
Mom.

939
01:27:12,360 --> 01:27:13,475
What?

940
01:27:18,320 --> 01:27:19,912
Do you like Sam?

941
01:27:21,280 --> 01:27:22,998
Yes.

942
01:27:23,680 --> 01:27:25,318
I do. I like him a lot.

943
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:29,672
So, why don't you ever tell me?

944
01:27:30,040 --> 01:27:32,190
'Cause it shouldn't matter what I think.

945
01:27:34,880 --> 01:27:36,996
I've been fooling around on him.

946
01:27:37,720 --> 01:27:40,553
Don't be stupid, Finn.
I know. I know.

947
01:27:46,360 --> 01:27:48,112
Don't ever tell him.

948
01:28:37,960 --> 01:28:39,632
What in the world?

949
01:28:52,600 --> 01:28:54,556
Shut the door, Mom!

950
01:32:51,480 --> 01:32:56,076
Finny, here, I found these inside.
I'll help you out here, honey.

951
01:32:56,560 --> 01:32:58,630
I'm never gonna find them all.

952
01:32:58,720 --> 01:33:00,790
I didn't even make a copy.

953
01:33:01,480 --> 01:33:04,358
That's a year and a half of my life, gone.

954
01:33:07,520 --> 01:33:09,909
I hope you're not saying that you're giving up?

955
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:11,877
Grandma, my notes are everywhere.

956
01:33:11,960 --> 01:33:14,952
I'd have to go back and rewrite it,
reconstruct the whole thing.

957
01:33:15,040 --> 01:33:16,837
I just can't do that.

958
01:33:17,120 --> 01:33:21,159
You think it's easier to start all over again
with something else?

959
01:33:23,360 --> 01:33:25,078
I don't know. Yes.

960
01:33:29,680 --> 01:33:33,958
How nice to be so unattached to something.

961
01:35:19,400 --> 01:35:21,709
- Just stay in your truck, Leon.
- Why?

962
01:35:21,800 --> 01:35:25,236
Because if you don't,
then I'm gonna have to kiss you.

963
01:36:01,880 --> 01:36:06,112
<i>That summer the Grasse Quilting Bee</i>
<i>did something they'd never done before.</i>

964
01:36:06,200 --> 01:36:08,873
<i>Anna called everyone back</i>
<i>and wouldn't let them go home...</i>

965
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:10,837
<i>... until they finished the quilt.</i>

966
01:36:10,920 --> 01:36:16,438
<i>They all worked 73 straight hours</i>
<i>sustained by Anna's will and gallons of iced tea.</i>

967
01:36:54,480 --> 01:36:55,629
Glady?

968
01:36:57,560 --> 01:36:58,390
Mother!

969
01:37:06,640 --> 01:37:08,278
That's good work.

970
01:37:48,920 --> 01:37:49,955
Quit it.

971
01:37:59,320 --> 01:38:00,639
Thank you.

972
01:38:39,280 --> 01:38:44,229
You know, you're not
as attractive as I thought you were.

973
01:38:46,960 --> 01:38:48,552
Well, thank you.

974
01:39:33,840 --> 01:39:37,355
Did you get the pages that I found in my yard?

975
01:39:37,440 --> 01:39:40,273
- I gave them to your grandma.
- Yeah. Thank you.

976
01:39:41,600 --> 01:39:43,989
They were wrinkled so I ironed them out.

977
01:39:44,200 --> 01:39:46,236
I singed one of the pages.

978
01:39:46,440 --> 01:39:48,874
I think you're only missing a word or two.

979
01:39:49,120 --> 01:39:51,031
Okay. That's fine.

980
01:39:51,880 --> 01:39:54,599
It's really good, what I read so far.

981
01:39:54,680 --> 01:39:57,114
I'd like to read the whole thing
when you're done.

982
01:39:58,680 --> 01:40:00,193
You're a good writer.

983
01:40:02,320 --> 01:40:03,639
Thank you.

984
01:40:07,280 --> 01:40:08,759
I was a diver.

985
01:40:11,080 --> 01:40:12,274
I know.

986
01:44:01,480 --> 01:44:02,595
Finn.

987
01:44:04,200 --> 01:44:08,352
I'm sorry. I'm early.
I was gonna wait until everybody got...

988
01:44:37,680 --> 01:44:40,717
<i>I'll tell you what makes me happy</i>
<i>about marrying Sam.</i>

989
01:44:40,800 --> 01:44:43,712
<i>I know our marriage has</i>
<i>as good a chance of being wonderful...</i>

990
01:44:43,800 --> 01:44:45,836
<i>... as it does of missing the mark.</i>

991
01:44:45,920 --> 01:44:50,755
<i>However, I'm banking on our love for each other</i>
<i>to weigh a bit heavier on the wonderful side.</i>

992
01:44:51,360 --> 01:44:56,275
<i>As Anna says about making a quilt,</i>
<i>"You must choose your combination carefully.</i>

993
01:44:56,680 --> 01:45:01,310
<i>"The right choices will enhance your quilt,</i>
<i>the wrong choices will dull the colors...</i>

994
01:45:01,400 --> 01:45:03,470
<i>"...hide their original beauty.</i>

995
01:45:03,800 --> 01:45:05,916
<i>"There are no rules you can follow.</i>

996
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:09,356
<i>"You have to go by instinct,</i>
<i>and you have to be brave."</i>
