acting kind of off, is all.

Off? How? I don't know.
Threatening me.

186
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:27,399
What does she want? Car?
Vacation, something?

187
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:30,027
No. Yeah, a vacation.

wouldn't be in a condo.

see the point here.

wrong with your marriage.

00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:56,036
Well, we've been married
31 years, isn't it?

00:19:57,947 --> 00:19:59,620
It's not perfect.

00:19:59,782 --> 00:20:02,626
But in your opinion,
it works well enough.

00:20:04,954 --> 00:20:06,456
But you wanted to come.

335
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:09,884

336
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:12,178
No. I mean, I paid for it.

337
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:16,349
With my own money,
from savings.

338
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:18,509
All right. So this is
really important to you.

339
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:20,932
Mmm-hmm.

340
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:22,725
Tell me why.

341
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:27,610

a marriage again.

343
00:20:28,811 --> 00:20:31,109

I don't know who does.

344
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:34,658
Arnold. Let's let Kay talk
and you can respond after.

348
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:45,957
Not just... You know,

349
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:50,708
but he would touch my arm
or my shoulder, just to...

350
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:54,966
Just to, I don't know,
because he wanted to.

351

And now he doesn't?

352
00:20:59,175 --> 00:21:01,303

Do you touch him?

354
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:07,725
Not really.
He doesn't like it.

355
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:11,354
Is she right, Arnold? Do you
like it when she touches you?

356
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,147
I don't know.

357
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:15,115
DR. FELD: You don't know?
I don't think about it.

358
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:18,781
All right.

360
00:21:23,324 --> 00:21:24,371
What else, Kay?

361
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:30,207
Well, it feels like we live in
the house together like two...

362
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:34,551
Like two workers
who bunk in the same room.

363
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:39,553
Except we don't...
We're not in the same room,

364
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:42,226
but it just feels
like there's nothing

365
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:45,020
holding us together
except the house.

366
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:47,348
Nothing holding us together
like 31 years of...

367
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:49,308
Of what, Arnold?

368
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:50,734
Marriage.

369
00:21:52,061 --> 00:21:53,529
What does that
word mean to you?

370
00:21:53,604 --> 00:21:56,073
Means we have a marriage license
and I pay all the bills.

371
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:58,492
Not to mention
our two grown...

372
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:00,907
You really have
lost your mind.

descriptive and positive.

375
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:09,036
Kay, please continue.

00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:12,373
Um...

377
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:16,001
We don't talk
about anything.

378
00:22:16,085 --> 00:22:19,055

I don't know about you?

379
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:20,756
About Eileen and
the skirts she bought

380
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:24,219
or if she took back the little
necklace with the tiki gods.

384
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:34,862
I don't tell Arnold how
I feel about anything.

385
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:38,691
And I don't know how he feels
about anything either.

386
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:40,697
I'll tell you how I feel
about this, I hate it.

387
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:42,653
All right. This is good.

388
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:43,783
ARNOLD: Good. Yeah.
Good for you.

389
00:22:43,946 --> 00:22:45,198
The more we tear
each other apart,

390
00:22:45,281 --> 00:22:47,033
the more money we have to pay
you to put it back together.

391
00:22:47,116 --> 00:22:51,246
(CHUCKLES) Jesus God. You
people are worse than lawyers.

392
00:22:52,997 --> 00:22:54,419
I understand how you feel.

393
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:55,841
Yeah?

394
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:59,045
You two have come here to try to
restore intimacy to your marriage.

395
00:22:59,128 --> 00:23:00,926
So that is
going to be the goal

396
00:23:01,005 --> 00:23:02,928
of our very focused
sessions together.

397
00:23:03,007 --> 00:23:06,102
To find ways to communicate
your needs to one another.

398
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:08,099
To cultivate intimacy.

399
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:12,274
And to develop the tools to sustain
that intimacy going forward.

400
00:23:17,146 --> 00:23:19,444
The first step in
rebuilding a marriage

401
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:22,322
is tearing away
some of the scar tissue

402
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:23,903
that has built up
over the years.

403
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:27,035
It can be very painful,
but it's worth it.

404
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:28,491
I like to think of it...

405
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:34,001
The metaphor of when you have a
deviated septum and you can't breathe?

406
00:23:34,872 --> 00:23:38,046
You have to break the nose
in order to fix it.

407
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:44,632
(CHUCKLES)
ARNOLD: <i>Charlatan!</i>

408
00:23:44,715 --> 00:23:47,264
No, he's worse than a charlatan.
He's like one of those...

410

The only thing he's honed

411
00:23:50,721 --> 00:23:52,769
is making sure that
if you don't walk in

412
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:54,441
with
a marriage-destroying problem,

413
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:56,439
you won't leave without one.

414
00:23:56,518 --> 00:24:00,489
He's like those moisturizing eye
drops that make your eyes dry.

415
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:03,317
$4,000. That could
have been a new roof!

416
00:24:03,651 --> 00:24:06,780
Did you look at his credentials or
even read that brochure that you...

417
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:07,909
I mean, my God!

418
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:11,204
Unbelievable! I'd like to have a
look at this guy's tax returns.

419
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:12,535
Whoo-hoo.

420
00:24:13,035 --> 00:24:17,085
Oh, don't.
Come on, just don't.

421
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:20,963
You have to
stop yelling at me.

422
00:24:21,043 --> 00:24:22,545
I'm not yelling!
Who's yelling?

423
00:24:22,628 --> 00:24:24,050
Hey. Welcome back.

424
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:26,302
I'll have an Arnold
Palmer and a tuna melt.

425
00:24:26,382 --> 00:24:28,805
You sure you're
ready to commit?

426
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:32,099
I'll have the soup
and salad, please.

Okey-dokey.

428
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:39,904
$9 for a tuna melt, it's canned
tuna, a slab of cheese and toast.

429
00:24:39,979 --> 00:24:42,107

getting kickbacks.

00:24:43,983 --> 00:24:46,486

00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:55,002

436
00:24:55,411 --> 00:24:56,458

00:24:57,204 --> 00:25:00,583

we are never coming back.

much as even one unkind word...

or do you want this kind here?

remember this next year

I never help and I never...

What was your first impression
of Kay, Arnold?

462
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:35,348
She was pretty.
Very pretty.

What else?

464
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:39,473

major in accounting.

picked the wrong horse."

But two days later,
I found it.

00:26:53,112 --> 00:26:56,116
He had hidden it,
the ring, in a cinnamon bun.

it's not like buying a car.

And that winter,
Arnold threw his back out.

474
00:27:12,422 --> 00:27:14,424
I was helping Brad
paint his room and...

475
00:27:14,508 --> 00:27:17,557
He said he would be more
comfortable sleeping alone.

his back got better.

It still bothers me
a little bit. But also I...

479
00:27:23,851 --> 00:27:24,977
He snores.

00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:29,360

00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:32,739

Well, let's try
to think about it.

It was four years ago, almost
five years ago. In September.

I mean, forced intimacy...
Is that really...

525
00:29:40,112 --> 00:29:41,113
It's not forced intimacy.

526
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:42,823
That's what it sounds like.
Oh...

527
00:29:42,948 --> 00:29:45,292
What? We're supposed to be truthful here.
DR. FELD: You are.

528
00:29:45,534 --> 00:29:48,959
Although... So what I'm saying is
that I don't think this exercise,

529
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:51,290
or whatever you wanna call it,
sounds like something...

530
00:29:51,373 --> 00:29:52,875
It's not forced.
If I do that

531
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:54,926
just because somebody tells
me to, what is the point?

532
00:29:55,002 --> 00:29:58,802
I don't think I like the idea
of anybody telling me...

533
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:03,306
I mean, the whole idea of this exercise
thing is totally ridiculous to me.

(SIGHS)

682
00:39:35,582 --> 00:39:40,429
I think I didn't want to think
about sex or about Arnold, even.

00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:45,968
It just made me sad thinking
about what I missed and...

684
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:52,432
What about your fantasy life?

685
00:39:54,183 --> 00:39:55,560

00:39:57,937 --> 00:39:59,189
What?

688
00:40:01,316 --> 00:40:05,366

know, we'll renew our vows.

689
00:40:07,322 --> 00:40:11,543
Just a little small ceremony,
on a beach, maybe.

690
00:40:11,618 --> 00:40:12,870
Right.

691
00:40:12,994 --> 00:40:14,587

692
00:40:15,914 --> 00:40:20,010
Right. And do you
have sexual fantasies?

693
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:25,681

694
00:40:26,925 --> 00:40:31,271

or dressed all in leather?

So, no.

698
00:40:39,604 --> 00:40:43,199

and things that we've done.

Let's talk about that.
ARNOLD: Let's not.

880
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:58,934
Let's just... I'm back, all right?
That ought to be enough.

881
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:00,511
It isn't, actually.

882
00:53:00,594 --> 00:53:02,471
What do you want
from me, blood?

883
00:53:02,596 --> 00:53:05,019
You have a lot
of anger, Arnold.

884
00:53:05,099 --> 00:53:06,521
What do you think
you're so angry about?

885
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:09,023
I'm angry about everything.
I'm angry about being here.

886
00:53:09,103 --> 00:53:11,322
Why? What are you
afraid will happen?

887
00:53:11,397 --> 00:53:13,900
You want to know what? Fine.

888
00:53:14,441 --> 00:53:15,784
What I'm afraid
will happen here

889
00:53:15,859 --> 00:53:18,328
is what probably happens in every
goddamn therapist's office

890
00:53:18,445 --> 00:53:20,368
every time any poor
couple goes in there.

891
00:53:20,447 --> 00:53:22,916
You say whatever thing,
because somebody like you

892
00:53:22,991 --> 00:53:25,494
is dragging it out of them and
then you can't take it back.

893
00:53:25,577 --> 00:53:28,831
There are things in this life
that you don't say for a reason.

894
00:53:28,914 --> 00:53:30,336
Like what?
What would you say?

895
00:53:31,333 --> 00:53:32,459
Uh...

896
00:53:34,545 --> 00:53:35,762
Tell me.

897
00:53:37,506 --> 00:53:39,804
I want to know.
I want to know.

898
00:53:40,634 --> 00:53:43,228
It's worse not knowing when there
are things that you're holding back

899
00:53:43,303 --> 00:53:45,397
you won't say because you think
I'm too fragile or whatever.

900
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:47,315
No, it's not that. It's...

901
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:49,064
Something I can't hear.

902
00:53:49,143 --> 00:53:51,066
All right, fine!
All right.

903
00:53:53,313 --> 00:53:54,815
She has a way...
Say it to Kay.

904
00:53:55,482 --> 00:53:59,532
You have a way of saying
that something's up to me

905
00:53:59,611 --> 00:54:01,739
and then when
I make a decision

906
00:54:01,822 --> 00:54:02,869
and it's something
you don't like,

907
00:54:02,948 --> 00:54:04,245
you don't actually
say anything,

908
00:54:04,324 --> 00:54:06,076
but you sure do get
your point across.

909
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:09,289
Well, can I just say, I don't like...
Is it my turn?

910
00:54:10,664 --> 00:54:13,417
I don't like the way
that we always do

911
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:16,344
something for Christmas,
or an anniversary,

912
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:20,300
that's a joint gift for the
house, like a water heater.

913
00:54:20,382 --> 00:54:21,429
You needed
that water heater.

914
00:54:21,508 --> 00:54:24,136
Yes, but you did, too.
You shower.

915
00:54:24,303 --> 00:54:26,556
Why is that
a special gift for me?

916
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:28,098
Hmm?

917
00:54:28,182 --> 00:54:31,937
And I hate watching golf.
I do. I think it's boring.

918
00:54:32,311 --> 00:54:35,155
And the shows where they
talk about golf, even worse.

919
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:37,733
It's like being
married to ESPN.

920
00:54:39,026 --> 00:54:41,779
And when you eat ranch chips,
your breath smells.

921
00:54:41,862 --> 00:54:43,614
I like ranch chips.

922
00:54:43,864 --> 00:54:45,707
And I hate it when
you rub up against me,

923
00:54:45,783 --> 00:54:48,286
like you just
expect me to do it.

924
00:54:48,368 --> 00:54:49,620
"Come on, let's go."

925
00:54:49,703 --> 00:54:52,126
Hell, it got to the point I was
afraid to make any kind of move.

926
00:54:52,206 --> 00:54:54,129
If I even so much as
tried to kiss you...

927
00:54:54,208 --> 00:54:56,336
Well, you never kiss me.

928
00:54:56,877 --> 00:54:59,756
You don't want to kiss me,
you just want "it."

929
00:54:59,838 --> 00:55:01,090
Not me.

00:55:01,715 --> 00:55:05,720

his eyes squeezed tight shut.

931
00:55:10,224 --> 00:55:12,477
It's not me.
You just want "it."

932
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:16,314
Hell, yes, I want "it." You can
bet your life I want "it."

933
00:55:16,396 --> 00:55:19,525
So screw me for wanting
to have sex with my wife!

934
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:23,074
And, you know,
it's not pleasant

935
00:55:24,238 --> 00:55:26,366
to do that with somebody
who doesn't want to do it.

936
00:55:28,534 --> 00:55:30,411
But you never saw me...

937
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:33,422
What?

938
00:55:34,248 --> 00:55:35,420
Go on, Arnold.

939
00:55:35,499 --> 00:55:37,718
I didn't complain
because Kay didn't want sex.

940
00:55:38,085 --> 00:55:41,009
Love. That's what I wanted.
Not just sex.

941
00:55:42,256 --> 00:55:43,883
I wanted you.

942
00:55:44,842 --> 00:55:47,846
Well, what about all those
years I wanted you?

943
00:55:48,136 --> 00:55:50,559
All those goddamn years.

944
00:55:54,226 --> 00:55:56,069
And I didn't cheat.

945
00:55:56,603 --> 00:55:58,321
I didn't go to hookers.

946
00:55:58,438 --> 00:56:00,691
I watched a little porn,
but who doesn't?

947
00:56:00,941 --> 00:56:03,569
I was good.
I did the right thing.

948
00:56:04,069 --> 00:56:06,163
Now you're
bringing me here for...

949
00:56:10,742 --> 00:56:13,916
You're the one
who stopped, not me.

950
00:56:15,873 --> 00:56:19,218
Yeah, for a while I stopped,
yes, but you stopped, too.

951
00:56:19,626 --> 00:56:22,129
You did. You stopped.

952
00:56:22,838 --> 00:56:25,557
Well, you don't just turn
it on and off, you know?

953
00:56:26,633 --> 00:56:29,136
Maybe when it's off,
it's just off.

954
00:56:34,975 --> 00:56:36,022
Off.

955
00:56:41,648 --> 00:56:42,649
(SIGHS)

956
00:56:44,985 --> 00:56:46,987
I want you to do
something for me.

957
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:50,536
I want you to tell me about
the best sex you ever had.

958
00:56:51,408 --> 00:56:55,003
The time that you can remember
that was the best. Either of you.

959
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:58,499
Even if it wasn't very good.
Even if it was terrible.

960
00:56:59,082 --> 00:57:00,550
Best time
that you remember.

961
00:57:04,630 --> 00:57:05,882
Well...

962
00:57:06,757 --> 00:57:07,849
Hmm.

963
00:57:08,425 --> 00:57:09,472
Oh.

964
00:57:09,551 --> 00:57:12,020
I remember one time.

965
00:57:13,847 --> 00:57:15,019
Kay was pregnant.

966
00:57:15,432 --> 00:57:17,776
Where were you?
In the kitchen.

967
00:57:19,603 --> 00:57:21,105
She was making soup.

968
00:57:21,188 --> 00:57:25,568
And I came in there and she kept
saying she had to stir her soup.

969
00:57:27,194 --> 00:57:30,198
And pretty soon,
she forgot about that soup.

970
00:57:31,031 --> 00:57:32,499
What do you remember, Kay?

971
00:57:35,619 --> 00:57:39,340
Well,
we were on the floor, and...

972
00:57:44,086 --> 00:57:45,838
And it was slow.

973
00:57:53,512 --> 00:57:57,562
He... He put some dish towels
behind my head

974
00:57:57,641 --> 00:57:59,143
so my head wouldn't bang on...

975
00:57:59,226 --> 00:58:02,480
Wouldn't bump up against
the bottom of the cabinet.

976
00:58:03,313 --> 00:58:05,907
That was... (LAUGHS)

977
00:58:10,654 --> 00:58:13,373
Arnold, what else
do you remember about that?

978
00:58:14,574 --> 00:58:16,247
Just wanting her.

979
00:58:18,078 --> 00:58:20,922
Just wanting her.

in the kitchen.

Happy.

982
00:58:30,465 --> 00:58:32,012
Beautiful.

983
00:58:33,635 --> 00:58:38,391
She had a little apron which was
getting to be too little because her

984
00:58:40,434 --> 00:58:42,528
belly was getting so big.

985
00:58:43,437 --> 00:58:45,610
You were very
attracted to her then.

986
00:58:46,481 --> 00:58:48,529
Yeah, I was, and...

987
00:58:48,608 --> 00:58:50,235
Are you still?

00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:55,791
Uh, I don't...
I don't know.

It's been a long
time since we've...

00:58:58,702 --> 00:59:00,704
I don't look
like I did then.

991
00:59:00,787 --> 00:59:01,879
No, it's not that.

992
00:59:01,955 --> 00:59:04,003
No. I never could
lose all the weight.

of it in that way any more.

I had one.

1012
01:00:06,436 --> 01:00:10,782

leap of faith and try something.
