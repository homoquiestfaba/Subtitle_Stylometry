00:00:25,563 --> 00:00:31,563
<i>Subrip by VaVooM</i>

2
00:00:31,564 --> 00:00:35,125
<i>We're gonna be real
Rough Riders in the building.</i>

3
00:00:35,468 --> 00:00:38,665
<i>You know, I ain't stopping until our
high school squad is an All Star squad.</i>

4
00:00:38,738 --> 00:00:40,763
<i>Are you all down?
We've got your back, Lina.</i>

5
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,569
Yeah, girl, we tighter
than a new weave.

6
00:00:42,642 --> 00:00:46,373
Go! Fight! Kill!
I mean, win!

7
00:00:47,814 --> 00:00:49,679
<i>Where you going,
cheer-quitas?</i>

8
00:00:49,749 --> 00:00:51,239
The Spirit Championship.

9
00:00:51,317 --> 00:00:53,911
<i>That's where the baddest
All Star squads go to compete.</i>

10
00:00:53,987 --> 00:00:55,614
<i>You don't look like
no All Stars, ma.</i>

11
00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:00,421
<i>Well, we're not. Yet.
But we will be.</i>

12
00:01:00,493 --> 00:01:02,427
<i>Then I guess you
ain't got one of these.</i>

13
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:07,195
<i>That's an All Star
bracelet. But...</i>

14
00:01:07,267 --> 00:01:10,259
Only the best of the best cheerleaders
win those. How did you get one?

15
00:01:10,336 --> 00:01:12,031
How you think?
You probably stole it.

16
00:01:12,105 --> 00:01:13,367
I know you did.

17
00:01:15,475 --> 00:01:16,464
Whatever.

18
00:02:18,004 --> 00:02:21,462
<i>That's going on right here.
Come on, bring it.</i>

19
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:06,480
Catalina!

20
00:03:06,553 --> 00:03:07,679
<i>No, mami!</i>

21
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:09,515
Lina, what are you doing?

22
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:11,022
<i>She married the gabacho!</i>

23
00:03:25,905 --> 00:03:28,100
<i>Stop! You're
ruining everything!</i>

24
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:30,598
Stop!

25
00:03:31,844 --> 00:03:32,868
<i>What's going on here?</i>

26
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,571
Cheer your
little barrio hearts out!

27
00:03:35,648 --> 00:03:38,139
<i>But Lina's coming to live with
me and my daughter in Malibu!</i>

28
00:03:47,827 --> 00:03:48,816
No!

29
00:03:55,602 --> 00:03:57,365
It was just a dream.

30
00:03:58,271 --> 00:04:00,364
It was just a bad dream.

31
00:04:05,044 --> 00:04:06,568
Now the real nightmare begins.

32
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:15,182
Oh, whoa, whoa.

33
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:17,120
Let me help you
with that, Wife.

34
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,487
Thank you, Husband.

35
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:22,854
<i>I know we sound silly, but I'll
never get tired of hearing it.</i>

36
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:25,756
<i>And I'll never get
tired of saying it.</i>

37
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:30,091
<i>I'm glad I skipped breakfast.</i>

38
00:04:31,971 --> 00:04:34,201
<i>Lina, you don't have to go
to school today, honey.</i>

39
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,970
<i>Actually, yes, I do.
It's my last day in East LA,</i>

40
00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:39,307
and as captain, I need to
handle some squad business.

41
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:40,403
I can give you
a ride if you want.

42
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,539
<i>Mmm-mmm.
No. I'd rather walk.</i>

43
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:44,105
Or get dragged by a bus.

44
00:04:44,183 --> 00:04:45,445
Lina, be nice.

45
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:48,744
<i>Look, I'm gonna be
late. I have to go.</i>

46
00:04:50,356 --> 00:04:51,755
All right. Bye.

47
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:54,426
Sorry.
Oh. No, no, no. Honey, listen,

48
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:56,826
<i>you got to give her a
little time. She'll adjust.</i>

49
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:59,932
<i>Then we'll be one big happy
family. I promise. Okay?</i>

50
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,021
I hate him. And his
daughter, she creeps me out.

51
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:26,489
<i>She's like way too
Single White Female.</i>

52
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:29,489
<i>She's probably just mad excited
about having a new sister.</i>

53
00:05:30,096 --> 00:05:32,894
Treyvonetta, come on.
Sky is not my sister.

54
00:05:32,965 --> 00:05:34,830
Not by cheer,
blood or marriage.

55
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:37,301
I feel you, Lina,
but for real though,

56
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:40,168
<i>girl, you can't complain
about moving to Malibu.</i>

57
00:05:40,239 --> 00:05:42,730
You about to be living large.

58
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:44,174
Yeah, right.

59
00:05:44,243 --> 00:05:45,870
Uh-oh. Love birds alert.

60
00:05:46,746 --> 00:05:47,735
Wassup?

61
00:05:48,648 --> 00:05:51,139
Trey and Lina are
here, okay? I got to go.

62
00:05:51,217 --> 00:05:54,152
<i>Come on, mija,
you know I love you.</i>

63
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,714
As much as you love this car?

64
00:05:55,788 --> 00:05:56,914
Hey,

65
00:05:57,724 --> 00:06:00,818
<i>at least she lets me get
under the hood. You don't.</i>

66
00:06:01,994 --> 00:06:02,983
Watch it, girl.

67
00:06:03,062 --> 00:06:04,188
Oh! I will watch it.

68
00:06:04,263 --> 00:06:06,163
<i>You don't want none of
these Golden Gloves.</i>

69
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,563
Get him, G.

70
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:13,737
<i>Easy, Oscar de la Ha-Ha. And you'd
better not be late picking me up.</i>

71
00:06:13,806 --> 00:06:17,469
What did I tell you about bossing me around
in front of your girly girls like that?

72
00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:19,406
At 4:30, Victor.

73
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:22,004
<i>You can't
tell me what to do.</i>

74
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:24,143
<i>I'm a man.</i>

75
00:06:25,818 --> 00:06:29,049
<i>I'll be here at 4:15 to
pick up your little pom poms.</i>

76
00:06:31,824 --> 00:06:35,487
Hey, make sure you two watch over
my baby girl for me, all right?

77
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:37,722
Victor, go.
We got this. Go.

78
00:06:38,798 --> 00:06:40,163
In the Gloria-mobile.

79
00:06:43,669 --> 00:06:45,534
This is so messed up, man!

80
00:06:45,605 --> 00:06:49,006
<i>I mean, now we're never gonna get
to be All Stars without you, Lina.</i>

81
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:51,133
<i>No, no, no.
We're going to be All Stars.</i>

82
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:53,872
<i>These quickie marriages,
they never last. I'll be back.</i>

83
00:06:53,946 --> 00:06:56,380
<i>Okay, so if you're so sure
you're gonna be back,</i>

84
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:58,849
<i>then why don't you just
come and stay with me?</i>

85
00:06:59,051 --> 00:07:02,145
Because my mom thinks that
going to school in Malibu

86
00:07:02,221 --> 00:07:03,813
is the best thing that
ever happened to me.

87
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:08,088
<i>She's like, "You'll get a better education.
It's safe. I won't have to worry. "</i>

88
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:10,960
Seriously, what is
there to worry about?

89
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:13,521
Besides, this is the first year
our squad is actually tight enough

90
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,533
to become real All Stars.

91
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:16,727
<i>That's what I'm
talking about.</i>

92
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:18,771
<i>Show everyone we're for real.</i>

93
00:07:18,838 --> 00:07:20,237
<i>See, that's what
I'm talking about.</i>

94
00:07:20,306 --> 00:07:22,399
<i>I want you to be
captain while I'm gone.</i>

95
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:25,501
Mmm-hmm. Me?
Captain? Yeah. Why?

96
00:07:26,345 --> 00:07:30,543
Because, besides me, like, you
have the most cheer experience.

97
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:31,844
That is true, G.

98
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:34,648
<i>You probably came out the
womb like this, "Give me a... "</i>

99
00:07:38,157 --> 00:07:40,057
That looks like me.

100
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:43,857
<i>But I don't do captain, all
right? I hate being in charge, man.</i>

101
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:47,297
Whatever, you the one that got Victor
wrapped around your baby finger.

102
00:07:47,366 --> 00:07:49,334
Yeah.
I think you can handle it.

103
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:51,597
<i>That's because I've got
something Victor wants.</i>

104
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:53,536
<i>But he ain't gonna get it.</i>

105
00:07:53,606 --> 00:07:56,268
<i>He ain't gonna get it!</i>

106
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:02,238
Okay, you guys, the new beginning
until the ripple goes like this.

107
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:05,182
<i>We're gonna change it now. It
starts with the same arm, same leg.</i>

108
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:07,446
It goes one, two, three, four.
Girls go back on five.

109
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:12,018
Hit six, six, seven
then eight. Ripple style.

110
00:08:12,091 --> 00:08:14,719
<i>Yeah, let's try that
with the music. Ready?</i>

111
00:08:16,596 --> 00:08:21,659
Five, six, seven, eight. Go one,
two, three, four. Go back, six...

112
00:08:24,303 --> 00:08:25,600
This is a cheer-wreck.

113
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:28,538
Yeah, our girl is
dying over there.

114
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:31,008
I feel like a witness
to a cheer-icide.

115
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:33,737
<i>You think she'll get better?
Hell no.</i>

116
00:08:38,384 --> 00:08:39,373
Really!

117
00:08:40,453 --> 00:08:43,251
Listen, you all need
to drop the attitude,

118
00:08:43,322 --> 00:08:45,847
<i>because while I'm gone,
Gloria is gonna be the captain.</i>

119
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:50,188
<i>Okay, it's like that, huh?</i>

120
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:53,358
<i>That's not very captain-like.</i>

121
00:08:53,432 --> 00:08:55,263
<i>Oh! I'm sorry. My bad.</i>

122
00:08:57,236 --> 00:09:01,935
Look, if we want to be All Stars, then
we need to practice like All Stars. Okay?

123
00:09:02,074 --> 00:09:04,269
<i>Now let's do this. Line up.</i>

124
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:07,375
Yeah, okay.
Keep it loose.

125
00:09:07,446 --> 00:09:09,243
<i>Oh! This ought to be good.
Charmaine, don't forget,</i>

126
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:11,044
pop on six, not seven.

127
00:09:11,117 --> 00:09:13,677
Five, six,
seven, eight. Music.

128
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:24,287
Right. Okay.

129
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:30,761
<i>Remember, All Stars,
that's what we want.</i>

130
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:39,534
Yes. Yes.

131
00:09:41,814 --> 00:09:45,545
All right. Pick it up.

132
00:09:46,218 --> 00:09:48,709
Okay, this is tight.
This is tight, ladies.

133
00:09:49,221 --> 00:09:50,552
Now, out!

134
00:09:51,724 --> 00:09:53,055
In you go, hard.

135
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:58,928
That was hot. Go.

136
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:01,561
Bring it in.

137
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,432
Come on.

138
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:12,074
East LA! East LA!
East LA! East LA!

139
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:15,778
East LA! East LA!
East LA! East LA!

140
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:18,242
In your face.

141
00:10:18,317 --> 00:10:21,218
<i>But they couldn't do
that five minutes ago.</i>

142
00:10:26,425 --> 00:10:28,017
<i>What's this?
Just a little something</i>

143
00:10:28,094 --> 00:10:29,721
<i>so you won't forget us.</i>

144
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:33,253
<i>Come on, guys, I can't forget
you. You're my cheer sisters.</i>

145
00:10:41,941 --> 00:10:43,909
I miss you guys already.

146
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:49,543
Come back soon,
you know, Lina. Real soon.

147
00:10:50,016 --> 00:10:53,076
<i>Catalina, mi amor, mi amor.
It's time to go.</i>

148
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:14,032
- East Los.
- Forever.

149
00:11:14,273 --> 00:11:16,537
<i>Don't forget us, Lina.
We love you.</i>

150
00:11:49,308 --> 00:11:52,607
So, how many
families live here?

151
00:11:52,678 --> 00:11:55,010
One. But it just
doubled in size.

152
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:59,947
<i>Now, listen, I want you both to feel
really comfortable here. Mi casa es su casa.</i>

153
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:01,508
Thanks, Enrique.

154
00:12:01,587 --> 00:12:03,748
<i>Come on, that's not how
Henry pronounces his name.</i>

155
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:05,154
<i>It's okay. She can call
me whatever she wants.</i>

156
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:07,021
Really? Well how about...

157
00:12:08,527 --> 00:12:10,085
Only if you can
say it in church.

158
00:12:10,162 --> 00:12:12,187
<i>Well that's really gonna
limit my vocabulary.</i>

159
00:12:26,645 --> 00:12:27,634
Wow!

160
00:12:28,814 --> 00:12:30,304
This is my room?

161
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:41,287
<i>I don't think I belong
here, you guys.</i>

162
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:46,889
Oh...

163
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:48,627
<i>Oh. No. Now that's bootleg.</i>

164
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:52,193
How are they gonna have a broken
toilet right next to a new one?

165
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:56,200
<i>It's not a toilet, Lina.
It's a bidet.</i>

166
00:12:56,842 --> 00:12:58,571
A... What?

167
00:12:59,411 --> 00:13:00,400
A bidet.

168
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:02,971
You use it to wash your...

169
00:13:03,048 --> 00:13:04,515
No, no, no.

170
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:06,016
<i>That's nasty. How...</i>

171
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:10,621
<i>I don't even drink out of a public
fountain. You expect me to use that?</i>

172
00:13:10,689 --> 00:13:12,680
Oh! I told Dad you were funny.

173
00:13:12,758 --> 00:13:15,625
<i>Thanks, Sky, but your
dad doesn't know me.</i>

174
00:13:15,694 --> 00:13:18,219
<i>He doesn't really even
know my mother, either.</i>

175
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:21,824
<i>Maybe, but I don't
think it really matters.</i>

176
00:13:22,835 --> 00:13:25,929
He said with Isabel,
it was love at first sight.

177
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:30,405
<i>You mean first he saw her
culata. And then he saw her tetas.</i>

178
00:13:31,377 --> 00:13:32,366
What?

179
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:33,801
Nothing.

180
00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:40,113
<i>Anyway, we're sisters now.
I have always wanted a sister.</i>

181
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:45,684
<i>It's gonna to take more than a marriage
license to be considered sisters.</i>

182
00:13:47,059 --> 00:13:49,323
Yeah, I know that.

183
00:13:49,595 --> 00:13:51,654
Even the Brady
Bunch had issues.

184
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:53,357
Right.

185
00:13:53,432 --> 00:13:56,868
<i>Anyway, I'm supposed
to tell you dinner's ready.</i>

186
00:13:58,871 --> 00:14:02,534
<i>You know what, I'm good. I'm actually
kind of tired. It's been a long day.</i>

187
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:03,802
Okay.

188
00:14:05,077 --> 00:14:06,567
Unfortunately.

189
00:14:25,497 --> 00:14:27,727
Remember, work on the sync
in the table top combination

190
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,098
and make sure that
Trey sticks her full back.

191
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:31,534
Yeah, okay. No problem.

192
00:14:32,004 --> 00:14:33,403
<i>Hey, what's it like there?</i>

193
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:36,731
<i>Lifestyles of the
Rich and Annoying.</i>

194
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:41,370
You have to see this!

195
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:44,413
<i>This girl's room is
like a cheer-seum.</i>

196
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:49,449
Her mother won championships
three times!

197
00:14:49,655 --> 00:14:53,056
<i>Wow! Oye, guey, that girl must
have cheerleading in her blood.</i>

198
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:55,457
<i>From what I've seen, I think
it skipped a generation.</i>

199
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,620
Looking for me?
Girl, I got to go.

200
00:14:58,964 --> 00:15:00,761
Is this you and your mom?

201
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,163
Yeah.
Wow.

202
00:15:05,971 --> 00:15:08,371
She must have been
an amazing cheerleader.

203
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:12,441
<i>Don't! I really don't like
people touching her stuff.</i>

204
00:15:12,544 --> 00:15:14,569
<i>Sorry.
It's fine.</i>

205
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:18,641
<i>It's no problem. Here.</i>

206
00:15:21,186 --> 00:15:22,551
Okay. Come on.

207
00:15:22,621 --> 00:15:25,613
<i>You don't want to be late
for your first day of school.</i>

208
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:28,387
Right, because being
the new kid is so much fun.

209
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:34,591
Yeah. So the pool and
the stadium are over there.

210
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:39,169
And you can get vegan
or sushi for lunch.

211
00:15:39,338 --> 00:15:40,327
And...

212
00:15:40,906 --> 00:15:41,930
Oh.

213
00:15:42,007 --> 00:15:46,637
<i>That's the Tai Chi class, which
doesn't count for PE credit.</i>

214
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:48,606
Go figure.

215
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,114
Who are they?

216
00:15:56,188 --> 00:15:57,849
Malibu Jaguars.

217
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:00,090
All Star squad.

218
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:02,059
They belong to the cheerleading
gym across the street,

219
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:05,426
but unfortunately some of
them go to school here.

220
00:16:05,764 --> 00:16:09,598
The Jaguars? They won the
Spirit Championship last year.

221
00:16:09,835 --> 00:16:11,234
<i>Avery's the captain.</i>

222
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:15,000
<i>Now, she's a hater.
A Sea Lion hater.</i>

223
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,505
Why?

224
00:16:16,575 --> 00:16:21,569
<i>She used to be one of us but we
didn't vote her captain, so she quit.</i>

225
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:25,075
She took all of our best
cheerleaders with her.

226
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:28,412
<i>Hey, you just can't
just walk up to them.</i>

227
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:30,720
Watch me.

228
00:16:31,623 --> 00:16:32,851
Avery?

229
00:16:34,693 --> 00:16:38,959
The Jaguars were sick last
year at the Spirit Championship.

230
00:16:39,031 --> 00:16:41,932
<i>I'm sorry,
no autographs today.</i>

231
00:16:42,434 --> 00:16:46,131
<i>No, look, look, I'm not
a groupie. I'm Catalina.</i>

232
00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:49,265
My East LA squad is like this
close to becoming All Stars, too.

233
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:52,777
<i>Wow! And I'm like
this close to caring.</i>

234
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:56,178
<i>I bet you'll care when we take that
bracelet away from you this year.</i>

235
00:16:56,715 --> 00:16:57,807
Cute.

236
00:16:58,317 --> 00:17:00,251
<i>But then you'd
have to beat us.</i>

237
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:01,843
<i>And that's just not happening.</i>

238
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,683
Like her outfit.

239
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,287
Was I talking to you?

240
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:07,620
Excuse me.

241
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:11,424
No, no, no. No time
for cat fights, Kayla.

242
00:17:11,497 --> 00:17:13,727
As a matter of fact, Cat,

243
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:18,826
<i>why don't you go back
to East LA? Just go south,</i>

244
00:17:18,937 --> 00:17:21,531
<i>and when you start to
smell poverty, you're home.</i>

245
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:26,374
Excuse me, but, Lina,
she lives here now.

246
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:31,280
<i>Wait. Your mother's that Mexican
maid who married Sky's daddy.</i>

247
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:32,749
<i>She doesn't look Mexican.</i>

248
00:17:32,818 --> 00:17:35,412
<i>For your information,
we're Cuban-American.</i>

249
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:36,647
Fascinating.

250
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,349
And my mother was a waitress.

251
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:40,114
A maid with tips.

252
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:44,790
<i>You know, y'all are lucky that my girls are
not here, because if they were here, we...</i>

253
00:17:44,863 --> 00:17:48,128
You know what, save
the urban drama, Cat.

254
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:50,599
<i>After all, you're
the lucky one.</i>

255
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:54,901
I mean, you got to
meet real All Stars today.

256
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:02,973
They give Malibu-Americans
a bad name.

257
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:15,693
And guess what.
Game over. We won by two.

258
00:18:20,365 --> 00:18:21,855
<i>Oh! That's gross.</i>

259
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:24,266
<i>I'm sorry. And you are?</i>

260
00:18:24,336 --> 00:18:25,598
Lina. Who are you?

261
00:18:25,671 --> 00:18:28,606
<i>I'm surprised you
have to ask. I'm Evan.</i>

262
00:18:28,674 --> 00:18:31,074
Well, Evan, you
have a booger.

263
00:18:31,877 --> 00:18:32,866
Uh...

264
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:52,853
Hi.

265
00:18:53,832 --> 00:18:56,164
So, we just figured
out your style.

266
00:18:56,268 --> 00:19:00,068
So are these old clothes? Are
they supposed to be vintage?

267
00:19:00,672 --> 00:19:03,664
No, more like
homeless couture.

268
00:19:03,742 --> 00:19:06,870
<i>Look, I don't care what
you label whores think.</i>

269
00:19:06,945 --> 00:19:08,139
<i>Where I'm from, this is tight.</i>

270
00:19:08,213 --> 00:19:09,475
<i>But you're here now,</i>

271
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:11,843
and you kind of stand
out like bad teeth.

272
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:13,646
Look, if you guys want
to take this outside,

273
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:15,016
we can do this.

274
00:19:15,087 --> 00:19:16,645
Hold up, jalapeno.

275
00:19:16,722 --> 00:19:20,385
<i>Yeah, Cat. You know, it's one
thing to be a fashion don't,</i>

276
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:26,090
but unless you want them to
give you a permanent facial,

277
00:19:26,732 --> 00:19:28,427
<i>don't threaten me.</i>

278
00:19:38,744 --> 00:19:40,371
You must be Lina.

279
00:19:40,445 --> 00:19:42,242
Yeah, and who are you?

280
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:47,251
<i>I'm Sky's friend, Christina.
Yeah, we're on the squad together.</i>

281
00:19:47,819 --> 00:19:49,081
<i>You're a cheerleader?</i>

282
00:19:49,154 --> 00:19:50,746
Go Sea Lions.

283
00:19:51,123 --> 00:19:54,615
<i>Look, no offense, but you sound
like you've had a cheer-botomy.</i>

284
00:19:55,661 --> 00:19:59,927
<i>How come people always say "No
offense" right before they offend you?</i>

285
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:03,825
<i>Look, it's been a...</i>

286
00:20:03,902 --> 00:20:08,896
<i>No offense, Lina,
but you're just like them.</i>

287
00:20:38,036 --> 00:20:39,025
Hey, Lina.

288
00:20:39,104 --> 00:20:41,834
Tell me you guys nailed the Liberty
combination! We have to hit every stunt.

289
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:47,371
Lina, Hold on. Victor,
enough with the up and down.

290
00:20:47,446 --> 00:20:51,576
You really want to see my
up and down? Okay, babe.

291
00:20:52,684 --> 00:20:53,742
Girl, we got a problem.

292
00:20:54,052 --> 00:20:56,748
<i>No. Don't tell me that, Gloria.
Step up! Make them practice harder.</i>

293
00:20:56,955 --> 00:20:57,944
I did, but...

294
00:20:58,023 --> 00:20:59,854
Motivate them! Inspire them!

295
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:03,791
<i>There's nobody left to inspire,
all right? Everybody quit.</i>

296
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:05,360
I mean, of course,
except Trey.

297
00:21:05,497 --> 00:21:08,591
My team quit? Why?

298
00:21:08,667 --> 00:21:10,965
<i>Because. Lina, I'm not you.</i>

299
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:12,367
<i>All right?
And they don't think that</i>

300
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:15,736
<i>I can make them All Stars, and
honestly, neither do I. I'm sorry.</i>

301
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:19,407
<i>It's okay. I know you...
I know you tried.</i>

302
00:21:19,478 --> 00:21:20,911
I really did.

303
00:21:22,914 --> 00:21:26,941
<i>But, hey, it's not all bad, you know.
You still get to be Princess Lina.</i>

304
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:28,850
Living in Malibu.

305
00:21:29,588 --> 00:21:30,577
Jaguars!

306
00:21:34,226 --> 00:21:37,389
<i>It ain't all good here,
mi hermana.</i>

307
00:21:37,596 --> 00:21:40,963
Look, I got to bounce.
My bus is here.

308
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:44,829
She just hung up.

309
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:55,510
Sorry about your team.

310
00:21:55,947 --> 00:21:57,346
<i>I'll deal with it later.</i>

311
00:21:58,517 --> 00:22:00,041
Sure.

312
00:22:01,353 --> 00:22:06,290
But if you wanna keep up your skills until
then, we have a spot on the Sea Lions.

313
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:08,388
Are you serious?

314
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:11,951
<i>My squad ain't even cold yet and
you're already cheer-jocking me?</i>

315
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:15,466
<i>You're right.</i>

316
00:22:16,401 --> 00:22:17,891
<i>I'm so sorry. I...</i>

317
00:22:27,412 --> 00:22:29,710
Why did you say that to Sky?

318
00:22:30,315 --> 00:22:33,011
<i>Why? It's not like
she's my real sister.</i>

319
00:22:33,318 --> 00:22:34,842
At least in East LA
I had family.

320
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,911
You have family here
now, too, Lina.

321
00:22:36,988 --> 00:22:39,388
<i>And Sky's been through
so much already.</i>

322
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:41,892
How would you feel
if you lost me?

323
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:47,222
<i>All right, I guess
I'll try to be nicer.</i>

324
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:49,358
<i>You're gonna do
a lot more than try.</i>

325
00:22:49,768 --> 00:22:51,827
<i>You're gonna be joining
the Sea Lions.</i>

326
00:23:15,127 --> 00:23:16,594
Trying out, huh?

327
00:23:18,864 --> 00:23:22,356
No, just checking things out.

328
00:23:22,768 --> 00:23:24,326
<i>That's cool.</i>

329
00:23:24,636 --> 00:23:27,867
You know, they kind of suck
after my sister quit.

330
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:31,933
<i>No. You're Avery's brother?</i>

331
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:33,904
Not in her fan club, huh?

332
00:23:33,979 --> 00:23:38,177
<i>I'm starting my own club. It's called
the League of Avery Can Kiss My Butt.</i>

333
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:41,447
<i>Yeah? Well, you won't
be the only member.</i>

334
00:23:43,789 --> 00:23:47,281
<i>You know, every pretty girl
doesn't have to be a cheerleader.</i>

335
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:49,493
I mean, the stuff they
do is way hard anyway.

336
00:23:49,561 --> 00:23:50,550
<i>It's not that hard.</i>

337
00:23:50,629 --> 00:23:51,755
Oh. No?

338
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:54,196
<i>Okay, that's easy
for a non-cheerleader to say.</i>

339
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:55,255
Okay.

340
00:23:56,468 --> 00:23:59,266
<i>So what's your thing?
You play ball?</i>

341
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:01,732
Maybe.
Think you can step?

342
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:05,740
Here, take a shot. Really.

343
00:24:05,811 --> 00:24:08,575
No, no, no, really this time.
Go ahead.

344
00:24:09,414 --> 00:24:11,314
Okay.
Go ahead. Right there.

345
00:24:16,822 --> 00:24:17,982
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

346
00:24:18,056 --> 00:24:19,387
Sorry, coach.

347
00:24:21,026 --> 00:24:22,425
<i>You think I'm a
klutz, don't you?</i>

348
00:24:22,494 --> 00:24:23,893
Maybe a little.

349
00:24:26,198 --> 00:24:27,426
Come here.

350
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:30,492
This is how you shoot.

351
00:24:35,106 --> 00:24:36,767
<i>That's it.</i>

352
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:40,309
<i>It's perfect.</i>

353
00:24:42,881 --> 00:24:44,371
Peep this.

354
00:24:44,449 --> 00:24:45,541
Okay.

355
00:24:53,859 --> 00:24:55,724
Lina! Hey, you came!

356
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:43,265
Good news. You made the team.

357
00:25:43,341 --> 00:25:45,172
<i>Let's face it,
she is the team.</i>

358
00:25:45,243 --> 00:25:46,710
And we voted
you team captain.

359
00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:49,305
<i>But you're captain.</i>

360
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:52,714
Yeah. By default, and I suck.

361
00:25:52,784 --> 00:25:54,649
But you are really good.

362
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:55,708
Yeah.

363
00:25:55,787 --> 00:25:56,981
You could fix us.

364
00:25:57,055 --> 00:25:59,546
You know, I thought
I can do this, but no.

365
00:25:59,624 --> 00:26:01,091
Come on.
Come on.

366
00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:03,525
Use your powers for good.

367
00:26:03,595 --> 00:26:07,053
<i>I mean, we do cheer
at, like, all of Evan's games.</i>

368
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:08,623
Yeah.

369
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,725
<i>So? I don't care about him.</i>

370
00:26:10,802 --> 00:26:12,201
Right.

371
00:26:13,772 --> 00:26:15,740
<i>We'll pretend like
we believe that.</i>

372
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:19,977
Please, Lina, we will work really hard.
Because we could be really good. I promise.

373
00:26:20,045 --> 00:26:21,478
<i>I'd settle for upright.</i>

374
00:26:21,546 --> 00:26:22,843
Good luck with that.

375
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:24,142
We still have to
fill another spot.

376
00:26:24,215 --> 00:26:28,174
You could fill it with whoever you want
to. It could be somebody good. I just...

377
00:26:30,322 --> 00:26:32,449
Yeah? Like who?

378
00:26:33,325 --> 00:26:34,690
You swear to help me out?

379
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:37,785
I will do whatever it takes.

380
00:26:42,701 --> 00:26:44,066
<i>Okay, I'm in.</i>

381
00:26:56,481 --> 00:26:57,505
Yes? Can I help you?

382
00:26:57,582 --> 00:26:59,573
Lina!

383
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:05,017
Meet the newest
member of our squad.

384
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:07,285
Go, Sea Crabs!
Sea Lions.

385
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:11,562
You said to make
more of an effort.

386
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:15,225
<i>Oye, guey, you got
one smoking casa!</i>

387
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:17,825
Thank you.

388
00:27:17,902 --> 00:27:22,032
<i>Okay. Henry's kindness is no excuse
for you to take advantage of him, Lina!</i>

389
00:27:22,173 --> 00:27:23,572
Not even a little?

390
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:25,906
<i>Gloria, tu mama, she
must be worried about you.</i>

391
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:28,403
I almost forgot.

392
00:27:32,117 --> 00:27:36,076
<i>She's got to go to work, but she'll
call you in the morning to thank you.</i>

393
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:37,746
I have a boyfriend.

394
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:41,451
Mama thinks this is like putting me
in the Virginity Protection Program.

395
00:27:41,893 --> 00:27:44,760
<i>You do realize that there's
a waiting list at MV, right?</i>

396
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:48,265
<i>Dad, can't you, like,
dialog with the principal?</i>

397
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:50,927
<i>Dialog? Please tell me you're
not teaching her hood talk.</i>

398
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:54,199
Come on, Dad. Strings
get pulled all the time.

399
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:56,830
<i>George Bush got into
Yale, didn't he?</i>

400
00:27:56,908 --> 00:27:59,672
Come on. No cheerleader
left behind.

401
00:28:01,312 --> 00:28:04,179
Please, Daddy? Please.

402
00:28:04,616 --> 00:28:07,744
<i>She used the "Daddy" card.
She's good.</i>

403
00:28:10,321 --> 00:28:11,310
All right.

404
00:28:16,327 --> 00:28:17,316
Thank you.
Thank you.

405
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:26,765
Five, six, seven, eight.

406
00:28:32,744 --> 00:28:34,609
Are those the Mountain Lions?

407
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:38,410
<i>It's the Sea Lions.
And no, those are the Jaguars.</i>

408
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:49,516
No. That was a big
bowl of wrong!

409
00:28:50,995 --> 00:28:51,984
Yeah.

410
00:28:54,699 --> 00:28:57,361
Looks like Dora the
Explorer has a new pal.

411
00:28:58,837 --> 00:29:02,068
<i>Seriously, Cat,
you're like a stalker.</i>

412
00:29:02,474 --> 00:29:05,705
<i>Don't you have anything else,
I don't know, better to do?</i>

413
00:29:06,344 --> 00:29:10,644
Better than watching you sweat
off a spray tan? Yes, I do.

414
00:29:10,715 --> 00:29:13,843
<i>As a matter of fact, I'm
going to Sea Lion practice.</i>

415
00:29:14,285 --> 00:29:16,082
They voted me captain.

416
00:29:16,287 --> 00:29:19,950
<i>And you're bragging about it.
What a cheer-barrassment.</i>

417
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:24,654
<i>Don't act like you didn't want to be
the captain of the Sea Lions, Avery.</i>

418
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:28,263
That was way back
when I was into charity.

419
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:30,735
<i>I'm so over that.</i>

420
00:29:30,802 --> 00:29:32,030
Over.

421
00:29:32,971 --> 00:29:35,030
<i>You're a big muscular girl.</i>

422
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,464
Are you gonna practice
with the Sea Lions, too?

423
00:29:37,542 --> 00:29:39,305
Or just bench press them?

424
00:29:40,512 --> 00:29:45,677
Wait, wait,
wait. She said you have

425
00:29:46,251 --> 00:29:49,846
<i>grande muscles.
Strong like bull.</i>

426
00:29:49,921 --> 00:29:51,047
Oh...

427
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:54,216
<i>I'm bilingual. Right?
I speak bitch, too.</i>

428
00:29:54,826 --> 00:29:58,489
<i>You got them right, man.
Cheer-brujas. Mean and bony.</i>

429
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:00,230
<i>Better than fat.
Let's go.</i>

430
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:01,560
You know... In a sec.

431
00:30:01,866 --> 00:30:04,027
<i>But your girls,
they're coming in too early.</i>

432
00:30:04,335 --> 00:30:06,565
They need to hold
on one, and then...

433
00:30:13,511 --> 00:30:17,277
Right. Now train your
little Sea Lions to do that.

434
00:30:17,348 --> 00:30:20,010
<i>Then maybe I'll be impressed.</i>

435
00:30:20,585 --> 00:30:23,247
<i>I'd rather be a Sea Lion,
if this is the best you got.</i>

436
00:30:23,354 --> 00:30:28,018
<i>So, Cat, I'm guessing your little amiga
hasn't seen the rest of the pod squad yet.</i>

437
00:30:28,092 --> 00:30:29,116
Has she?

438
00:30:31,763 --> 00:30:32,889
<i>They're really good. Really.</i>

439
00:30:32,964 --> 00:30:34,454
Really good.

440
00:30:34,532 --> 00:30:37,000
Your Sea Otters
got skills, right?

441
00:30:45,143 --> 00:30:46,906
They have potential.

442
00:30:46,978 --> 00:30:48,912
Really? Where do they keep it?

443
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:54,109
Why is that girl dancing
with her tongue out?

444
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:56,619
She said it helps
her concentrate.

445
00:30:56,921 --> 00:31:00,914
<i>I used to have a dog who did
that. He couldn't cheer either.</i>

446
00:31:01,326 --> 00:31:06,229
<i>Okay. All right, I know it's bad, but,
Christina, she's got tumbling skills</i>

447
00:31:06,297 --> 00:31:09,061
and Sky has spirit.

448
00:31:09,667 --> 00:31:12,727
<i>And don't forget her mom
won, like, every award.</i>

449
00:31:12,804 --> 00:31:15,534
<i>Like, deep down, she's got
cheerleading in her gut!</i>

450
00:31:16,808 --> 00:31:19,140
<i>Too bad it's not in
her brain or muscles.</i>

451
00:31:20,078 --> 00:31:21,773
<i>We've got some work to do.</i>

452
00:31:21,846 --> 00:31:22,938
Yeah.

453
00:31:23,014 --> 00:31:24,140
Six, seven, eight.

454
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:25,477
One, two, three...
Load it out.

455
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:26,539
Load it out.

456
00:31:26,618 --> 00:31:27,676
...four, five, six,
seven, eight.

457
00:31:27,752 --> 00:31:29,447
One, two, three, four.

458
00:31:30,255 --> 00:31:31,916
High knees. High knees.

459
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:34,350
<i>Six. You ain't cute.</i>

460
00:31:34,425 --> 00:31:37,019
One, two, three,
four, five, six.

461
00:31:38,029 --> 00:31:39,326
Hey! Hey.

462
00:32:04,489 --> 00:32:06,150
Four, five, six. One.

463
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:12,020
Are you okay?

464
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:13,358
You all right, man?

465
00:32:14,365 --> 00:32:16,765
<i>I'd rather eat
underwear and die.</i>

466
00:32:17,035 --> 00:32:20,698
Sweaty, day-old,
butt-wedgie underwear.

467
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:26,843
Whitney, come back!

468
00:32:30,014 --> 00:32:34,144
<i>She was one of our best dancers. I
mean, I know that's not saying much,</i>

469
00:32:34,218 --> 00:32:37,119
but what are we
supposed to do now?

470
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:42,782
<i>I've got an idea.</i>

471
00:32:55,506 --> 00:32:57,303
In the house!

472
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:06,750
<i>This is nice! You all
should go on Cribs.</i>

473
00:33:07,018 --> 00:33:09,509
<i>Hey, I'm Treyvonetta.</i>

474
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:12,551
Girl, how many
bedrooms you all got?

475
00:33:13,191 --> 00:33:15,591
Six bedrooms and seven
and a half baths.

476
00:33:15,927 --> 00:33:17,087
We can each have
own our own suite.

477
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:18,651
Nice! Sweet!

478
00:33:20,298 --> 00:33:21,663
<i>I'll show you a tour.</i>

479
00:33:28,773 --> 00:33:31,936
Okay, Gloria, Trey and I are
gonna break it down for you. Okay?

480
00:33:32,076 --> 00:33:34,169
Five, six, seven, eight.

481
00:33:34,245 --> 00:33:42,184
One, two, three and four.
Five, six, seven, eight.

482
00:33:42,253 --> 00:33:46,189
One and two, three and four.
Five, six and roll it out.

483
00:33:46,257 --> 00:33:49,021
One, two, three and give it.

484
00:33:49,093 --> 00:33:52,324
I feel so white.

485
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:55,497
Me, too.
Like Clay Aiken white.

486
00:33:55,633 --> 00:33:57,464
Okay, okay. Come on, get up.

487
00:33:57,535 --> 00:34:00,868
You know, rhythm has no color.
You know, just shake and jive.

488
00:34:00,938 --> 00:34:02,633
<i>Gonna have some fun.
That's right! Come on.</i>

489
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:04,002
Shake what your mama gave you.

490
00:34:04,075 --> 00:34:09,035
I mean, we just could keep the old
routine until, like, after the game.

491
00:34:09,747 --> 00:34:11,738
Or until we graduate.

492
00:34:11,816 --> 00:34:14,011
Look, you want this school
to respect you, right?

493
00:34:14,085 --> 00:34:15,143
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

494
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:16,550
Then you need to
respect yourselves.

495
00:34:16,621 --> 00:34:18,521
Which means you need
to improve on your skills.

496
00:34:18,589 --> 00:34:22,753
<i>That's right. So let's
drop it like it's hot.</i>

497
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:25,795
Hit it, girl.
Take notes.

498
00:34:26,631 --> 00:34:32,160
<i>Yeah. Is there an easier version
that's maybe, like, lukewarm?</i>

499
00:34:33,671 --> 00:34:36,037
Sky, this is the easy version.

500
00:34:36,107 --> 00:34:37,506
Now, come on, Sea Lions.

501
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:40,603
<i>You can do this.
That's right, come on.</i>

502
00:34:40,678 --> 00:34:41,975
All right. Get into formation.

503
00:34:52,723 --> 00:34:54,953
<i>Gloria, look who's here.</i>

504
00:34:55,026 --> 00:34:56,186
Victor!

505
00:34:58,396 --> 00:34:59,488
Victor!

506
00:35:01,732 --> 00:35:03,700
You came all the way
out here to see me.

507
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:05,258
<i>You're my chulita.</i>

508
00:35:05,336 --> 00:35:07,167
<i>I'd follow you anywhere.</i>

509
00:35:07,705 --> 00:35:09,036
<i>That's sweet.</i>

510
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:11,332
Can you spot me
a twenty for gas?

511
00:35:11,409 --> 00:35:12,671
No!

512
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:14,604
Damn!

513
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:17,875
<i>Yo, who's this?</i>

514
00:35:19,584 --> 00:35:23,452
<i>I'm Sky. It's a
pleasure to meet you.</i>

515
00:35:24,922 --> 00:35:27,220
<i>So you're Lina's sister
from another mister.</i>

516
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:29,088
<i>I haven't thought of it like
that. No, no. Not really.</i>

517
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:33,059
Hey, Lina. Who is that dude
over there checking you out?

518
00:35:33,764 --> 00:35:34,753
Oh!

519
00:35:34,866 --> 00:35:36,231
Go ahead, Lina.

520
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,562
<i>That boy's finer
than baby hair.</i>

521
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:39,626
<i>Whatever. He's just some guy.</i>

522
00:35:39,704 --> 00:35:44,038
<i>Yeah, right. Evan's, like,
the most popular guy in school.</i>

523
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:46,367
<i>Please. I'm not impressed.</i>

524
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:49,571
Lina, if Malibu Ken
is sweating you,

525
00:35:50,515 --> 00:35:53,575
I can put that fool in
check, real quick.

526
00:35:54,218 --> 00:35:56,049
Look at this guy.
Look at this guy.

527
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,985
<i>Go get him, papi. You go!</i>

528
00:35:59,891 --> 00:36:01,085
Do that.

529
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:02,319
<i>What's happening?</i>

530
00:36:02,393 --> 00:36:03,587
<i>He's a mess.</i>

531
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,497
<i>What's up, bro?</i>

532
00:36:10,568 --> 00:36:12,001
Dude, is that your ride?

533
00:36:12,069 --> 00:36:16,768
Yeah, foo, cherried-out,
top of the line hydraulics.

534
00:36:17,475 --> 00:36:19,340
What do you know
about that, beach boy?

535
00:36:20,912 --> 00:36:22,209
<i>She's a head turner.</i>

536
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:24,407
All right. Check this out.

537
00:36:24,615 --> 00:36:26,310
<i>I hope he doesn't
scare him too much.</i>

538
00:36:26,384 --> 00:36:27,442
<i>He'll be good.</i>

539
00:36:30,087 --> 00:36:32,681
<i>He's supposed to scare him,
not be all lovey-dovey.</i>

540
00:36:32,757 --> 00:36:33,985
What?

541
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:35,716
<i>She's pimped to the max.</i>

542
00:36:35,793 --> 00:36:37,124
Thanks, man.

543
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:40,858
<i>You know, that's tight you
know how we roll in East Los.</i>

544
00:36:41,065 --> 00:36:42,191
<i>I'm Victor.</i>

545
00:36:42,266 --> 00:36:43,392
Evan.

546
00:36:43,901 --> 00:36:45,869
<i>What... They look like
they're about to hug.</i>

547
00:36:47,405 --> 00:36:48,565
<i>They're hugging.</i>

548
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:52,234
<i>Dude, that's what happens when you send
a Chihuahua to do the job of a pit bull.</i>

549
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:55,473
<i>So, what's up, Evan?
You trying to push up on Lina?</i>

550
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:56,979
<i>Dude, I'm trying.</i>

551
00:36:57,248 --> 00:36:59,546
But I swear, every time I step
to her, I say something stupid.

552
00:36:59,617 --> 00:37:01,312
<i>So, I don't know
how well it's going.</i>

553
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:05,219
<i>Bro, you just got to know
how to handle these chicas.</i>

554
00:37:05,289 --> 00:37:06,950
You got to be in charge, homie. Yeah.

555
00:37:07,024 --> 00:37:10,516
<i>They love that. Come on, man.
I'll show you how it's done.</i>

556
00:37:11,128 --> 00:37:13,255
Come on. Come on, man.

557
00:37:13,364 --> 00:37:15,355
Wait, wait, wait. Why
are they coming over here?

558
00:37:15,433 --> 00:37:16,957
Wait. Quick, quick,
quick. Lip check.

559
00:37:17,034 --> 00:37:19,025
Lip Smacker. Here.

560
00:37:19,103 --> 00:37:20,092
Perfect. Watermelon.

561
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:22,728
Thanks.

562
00:37:25,042 --> 00:37:26,839
Gloria...
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

563
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:30,711
<i>Let's roll out. Evan here
wants to holla' at your girl.</i>

564
00:37:30,781 --> 00:37:32,180
Okay. Are you cool?

565
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,308
Yes, whatever.

566
00:37:34,318 --> 00:37:36,343
<i>Okay. We'll wait for
you in the car.</i>

567
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:37,444
Mmm-hmm.

568
00:37:37,521 --> 00:37:39,512
Quit staring. Come on.

569
00:37:45,529 --> 00:37:47,588
<i>See, that's how you do it.</i>

570
00:37:48,399 --> 00:37:49,866
Come on.

571
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:52,334
So...
So...

572
00:37:52,403 --> 00:37:53,870
We should hang out.

573
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:55,098
Yeah, right.

574
00:37:55,172 --> 00:37:57,538
Your sister would freak out if
she saw us hanging out together.

575
00:37:57,608 --> 00:38:00,168
<i>Come on. Let her freak.
It's nothing new.</i>

576
00:38:00,244 --> 00:38:02,109
Okay.
Yeah?

577
00:38:02,179 --> 00:38:04,443
<i>Maybe. I'll think about it.</i>

578
00:38:05,516 --> 00:38:07,711
<i>Okay. I'll see you at the game tomorrow.</i>

579
00:38:07,985 --> 00:38:09,475
Yes, you will.

580
00:39:21,258 --> 00:39:23,123
Get up, get up, quick.
Give me your hand.

581
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:27,221
<i>They're even worse than
they were before. I love it.</i>

582
00:39:27,631 --> 00:39:30,156
I knew this would be worth
being late for practice.

583
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:37,698
<i>Let's put them out
of their misery.</i>

584
00:39:38,976 --> 00:39:40,102
Jaguars.

585
00:39:47,318 --> 00:39:48,785
<i>We can't just walk out.</i>

586
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,348
Hell, no.

587
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:51,779
Come on.

588
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:30,820
Jaguars!
Jaguars!

589
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:37,432
<i>If you want to win, yell with all your
might! When we say "Go," you say "Fight!"</i>

590
00:40:37,501 --> 00:40:38,729
- Go!
- Fight!

591
00:40:38,803 --> 00:40:40,065
Go!
Fight!

592
00:40:40,171 --> 00:40:42,537
Malibu Vista!

593
00:40:48,979 --> 00:40:50,173
This is Sea Lion territory.

594
00:40:50,247 --> 00:40:52,681
<i>Don't ever shake your conceited
Jag butt over here again.</i>

595
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:57,153
<i>Excuse me. Then who's supposed to show
our school what a real squad looks like?</i>

596
00:40:57,221 --> 00:40:59,348
Not this mariachi band.

597
00:40:59,423 --> 00:41:01,254
<i>You're so lucky I found Jesus.</i>

598
00:41:01,325 --> 00:41:03,225
<i>Hey, hey, hey. Okay?
I didn't use my hands.</i>

599
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:05,626
<i>All right. But you
can't fight girls like this.</i>

600
00:41:06,096 --> 00:41:07,893
They press charges.
Right.

601
00:41:08,766 --> 00:41:10,028
Run away.

602
00:41:16,707 --> 00:41:17,833
Jaguars.

603
00:41:24,815 --> 00:41:26,146
Emergency practice session?

604
00:41:26,217 --> 00:41:27,309
Yes. As long as it takes.

605
00:41:27,585 --> 00:41:30,713
<i>Lina. Look, I'm sorry
about my sister.</i>

606
00:41:30,788 --> 00:41:32,187
<i>She's...
Forgotten.</i>

607
00:41:32,857 --> 00:41:35,155
Okay. Works for me.

608
00:41:35,226 --> 00:41:37,854
Why is your brother talking
to Miss Chiquita Banana?

609
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:41,321
<i>He's always dating down.
But don't you worry.</i>

610
00:41:41,866 --> 00:41:42,924
<i>I'll fix it.</i>

611
00:41:43,033 --> 00:41:44,557
You know, I need to take
care of some team stuff.

612
00:41:44,635 --> 00:41:45,624
Yeah.

613
00:41:45,903 --> 00:41:48,565
<i>I would, too, if my team got
spanked like that. I'd...</i>

614
00:41:52,243 --> 00:41:55,007
<i>I mean, I'll just catch
up with you later.</i>

615
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:05,416
Okay. I see the little wheels
turning in your evil little head.

616
00:42:05,489 --> 00:42:06,888
What you thinking?

617
00:42:06,957 --> 00:42:08,447
<i>That we're outnumbered
and unarmed.</i>

618
00:42:09,627 --> 00:42:12,824
If we were surrounded by all these
people back home, what would we do?

619
00:42:12,897 --> 00:42:14,865
<i>Pretend to no habla ingles?</i>

620
00:42:14,932 --> 00:42:16,729
Use our white voices?

621
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:18,194
No.

622
00:42:18,669 --> 00:42:20,330
Call for backup.

623
00:42:20,404 --> 00:42:21,666
Honestly, I was gonna say run.

624
00:42:21,939 --> 00:42:23,406
<i>But let's do that.</i>

625
00:42:23,474 --> 00:42:25,305
Guys, I know exactly
what we need to do.

626
00:42:48,365 --> 00:42:51,459
<i>Lina, I don't think
this was a good idea.</i>

627
00:42:55,439 --> 00:42:57,464
How do they move
their bodies like that?

628
00:42:57,541 --> 00:43:00,908
<i>Don't be scared, Sky.
Look, I got you looking good.</i>

629
00:43:00,978 --> 00:43:03,776
This is impromptu flavor
school for you guys.

630
00:43:03,847 --> 00:43:05,337
<i>We're about to
loosen you guys up.</i>

631
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:06,607
What do you mean?

632
00:43:10,354 --> 00:43:11,582
<i>You'll see.</i>

633
00:43:22,299 --> 00:43:23,960
<i>What's wrong now?</i>

634
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:29,801
Nothing. I just realized
something.

635
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:33,603
I just realized Lina
already has two sisters.

636
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:37,175
<i>She doesn't need me.</i>

637
00:43:37,648 --> 00:43:40,742
<i>Come on, you're being so
Betty Buzzkill right now.</i>

638
00:43:40,818 --> 00:43:45,619
I know you better than anyone else and it
seems to me like you both need each other.

639
00:43:45,689 --> 00:43:47,384
I have homework.
I should go home.

640
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:48,686
Sky?

641
00:43:52,763 --> 00:43:55,231
<i>Man, you look hot.
Dance with me, chulita.</i>

642
00:43:56,266 --> 00:43:57,597
Okay.

643
00:43:57,668 --> 00:43:58,760
Christina?

644
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:04,604
I have a 4.0 GPA. Leave
me alone, Betty Buzzkill.

645
00:44:18,722 --> 00:44:19,814
Yeah.

646
00:44:24,762 --> 00:44:25,922
Yeah, baby.

647
00:44:34,004 --> 00:44:35,801
Sky, want to dance?

648
00:44:35,873 --> 00:44:36,999
No, thanks.

649
00:44:37,074 --> 00:44:38,268
<i>Come on.
No, I'm good.</i>

650
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:39,570
You know you want to.

651
00:44:39,643 --> 00:44:41,634
<i>No, I'm good right here.
Thank you.</i>

652
00:44:45,616 --> 00:44:46,742
Sky!

653
00:44:50,187 --> 00:44:52,519
<i>Sky, come on. Let's go.</i>

654
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:58,958
<i>Sky's in the house.</i>

655
00:44:59,563 --> 00:45:03,226
<i>Come on, girl. Don't be
scared. Shake it. Yeah.</i>

656
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:06,195
Come on, make us proud, Sky.

657
00:45:14,344 --> 00:45:15,936
Look at those hips.

658
00:45:17,114 --> 00:45:18,274
All right.

659
00:45:25,022 --> 00:45:26,148
Lina.

660
00:45:31,161 --> 00:45:32,992
<i>You know, it's called
stalking, Evan.</i>

661
00:45:33,063 --> 00:45:34,155
Yeah?

662
00:45:34,965 --> 00:45:38,901
<i>Let me guess. Your new friend
Victor told you I'd be here.</i>

663
00:45:39,069 --> 00:45:40,661
Yeah, maybe.

664
00:45:40,838 --> 00:45:44,467
<i>You know, but I cannot believe you didn't
invite me to your little party yourself.</i>

665
00:45:44,541 --> 00:45:47,908
I mean, especially after I told
everyone how much I like you.

666
00:45:47,978 --> 00:45:49,309
<i>It's just rude.</i>

667
00:45:49,379 --> 00:45:50,641
You did not.

668
00:45:51,982 --> 00:45:53,973
No, but I will.

669
00:45:55,853 --> 00:45:57,650
Are you always this corny?

670
00:45:58,355 --> 00:45:59,481
You just make me nervous.

671
00:45:59,556 --> 00:46:01,387
Me?
Yeah.

672
00:46:01,458 --> 00:46:03,085
<i>Why? You're Mr. Popularity.</i>

673
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:04,457
Come on.

674
00:46:04,528 --> 00:46:08,794
<i>That's what those other kids see me
as. But you don't. And I dig that.</i>

675
00:46:16,707 --> 00:46:20,268
<i>Christina, why can't we
be more like them?</i>

676
00:46:21,879 --> 00:46:24,507
Because we took
a purity pledge.

677
00:46:25,215 --> 00:46:28,912
<i>But that doesn't mean we can't be
more cool and hot like they are.</i>

678
00:46:29,787 --> 00:46:30,879
I guess.

679
00:46:32,723 --> 00:46:33,712
Uh-oh.

680
00:46:35,759 --> 00:46:37,158
Yo, what you looking at?

681
00:46:37,227 --> 00:46:38,888
Who, me?

682
00:46:39,596 --> 00:46:41,689
Nothing. Are you
calling my girl nothing?

683
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:43,664
I saw the way you
was looking at her.

684
00:46:43,734 --> 00:46:45,133
What way? There was a way?

685
00:46:45,402 --> 00:46:49,270
<i>No, there's no way.
I was just looking.</i>

686
00:46:49,373 --> 00:46:51,534
So you admit you
was looking at me.

687
00:46:51,608 --> 00:46:53,473
<i>All right, I'm gonna show you
something to look at.</i>

688
00:46:53,544 --> 00:46:58,038
Wait. You want to fight me
because I looked at you?

689
00:46:58,115 --> 00:47:00,709
What, did you think you could just
look at my girl and get away with it?

690
00:47:00,784 --> 00:47:02,513
<i>Uh-uh. We don't
play that here.</i>

691
00:47:02,586 --> 00:47:04,554
Christina, do something.

692
00:47:05,923 --> 00:47:07,914
Lina! Lina! Help!

693
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:14,259
<i>They're gonna kill Sky!</i>

694
00:47:14,331 --> 00:47:16,629
<i>Wait, hold up. Wait,
what's the problem?</i>

695
00:47:17,134 --> 00:47:18,965
<i>I don't know. I mean, I
was just looking at her.</i>

696
00:47:19,036 --> 00:47:20,333
And then she came
down the stairs and...

697
00:47:21,638 --> 00:47:22,969
No! Why, Sky?

698
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:24,871
<i>Sky, you just can't
be looking at people.</i>

699
00:47:24,942 --> 00:47:27,536
I mean, the last girl that
looked at me needed stitches.

700
00:47:27,611 --> 00:47:30,705
<i>Yo, what's up with your girl,
Lina? Staring like she loco.</i>

701
00:47:30,781 --> 00:47:31,907
You know the deal.

702
00:47:31,982 --> 00:47:33,449
<i>Yeah, I do, but she don't.</i>

703
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:34,643
<i>She's from Malibu.</i>

704
00:47:34,718 --> 00:47:38,882
Like, people over there just be looking
at each other for no reason. All the time.

705
00:47:38,956 --> 00:47:42,255
<i>Let me talk to her and explain
it. She'll be straight. Okay?</i>

706
00:47:42,926 --> 00:47:45,622
<i>Fine. We didn't come
here to fight, no way.</i>

707
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:51,129
Will somebody tell
me what just happened.

708
00:47:51,201 --> 00:47:53,999
<i>Sky, you can't just be looking
at people any kind of way.</i>

709
00:47:54,071 --> 00:47:58,440
Like, you can glance at somebody
and smile. But if you stare at them

710
00:47:58,508 --> 00:48:00,669
or you give them one of these.

711
00:48:00,978 --> 00:48:02,377
Or one of these.

712
00:48:03,814 --> 00:48:05,179
<i>That's disrespectful.</i>

713
00:48:05,249 --> 00:48:06,375
And your ass.

714
00:48:07,317 --> 00:48:08,944
<i>You understand, chica?</i>

715
00:48:09,019 --> 00:48:11,715
Yeah. I think so.

716
00:48:11,822 --> 00:48:15,656
Good, next time we bring you to
East LA, bring your sunglasses.

717
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:17,193
Yeah. Big ones.

718
00:48:17,961 --> 00:48:19,428
All right, come, honey.

719
00:48:22,566 --> 00:48:23,931
<i>It's all good.
Everything okay?</i>

720
00:48:24,001 --> 00:48:25,195
Yeah, come on.

721
00:49:01,438 --> 00:49:04,464
Five, six,
seven, eight. Two.

722
00:49:08,478 --> 00:49:11,413
Five, six, seven, eight. Two.

723
00:49:13,050 --> 00:49:14,039
<i>What's wrong with me?</i>

724
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:18,220
Two, four.

725
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:20,612
God...

726
00:49:24,695 --> 00:49:25,855
I suck. Great.

727
00:49:27,631 --> 00:49:29,599
Okay. One...

728
00:49:31,501 --> 00:49:32,866
Hold your chest up.

729
00:49:34,071 --> 00:49:35,299
<i>What's the use?</i>

730
00:49:36,006 --> 00:49:37,769
<i>I'm nothing like my mother.</i>

731
00:49:37,841 --> 00:49:40,537
<i>Sky, look, I'm sure
that's not true.</i>

732
00:49:41,778 --> 00:49:44,747
<i>Because as much as I hate to
admit it, I'm a lot like my mom.</i>

733
00:49:45,315 --> 00:49:46,907
<i>I'm opinionated, stubborn...</i>

734
00:49:46,984 --> 00:49:48,144
Loud.

735
00:49:51,455 --> 00:49:53,650
Yeah, that, too.

736
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:57,919
Which means you have to have
a part of your mom in you.

737
00:49:58,428 --> 00:49:59,759
You really think so?

738
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:02,188
Yeah, I really do.

739
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:06,894
Well, would you
help me find her?

740
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:09,995
Yeah.

741
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:17,345
Ready? Five, six, seven,
eight. One, two, three, four.

742
00:50:17,514 --> 00:50:22,713
Keep your chest up. Seven, eight.
One, two, three and sit in it.

743
00:50:22,786 --> 00:50:25,118
Five, six, seven, clap.

744
00:50:26,957 --> 00:50:29,653
<i>That's what I'm
talking about. It's fun.</i>

745
00:50:58,155 --> 00:51:04,060
Here we go! Malibu Vista on the
move. Taking all you fools to school.

746
00:51:04,127 --> 00:51:08,188
<i>We're caliente.
You know, hot, hot, hot.</i>

747
00:51:08,265 --> 00:51:12,964
<i>We always stay on top. We make
you sweat 'cause we run faster.</i>

748
00:51:13,036 --> 00:51:16,130
<i>Try to catch up
and we say hasta.</i>

749
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:25,905
Sea Lions! Sea Lions!
Sea Lions! Sea Lions!

750
00:51:25,982 --> 00:51:28,246
Sea Lions!
Sea Lions!

751
00:51:30,454 --> 00:51:32,820
Oh, my God. That was fun.

752
00:51:39,129 --> 00:51:41,324
Someone just had a cheer-gasm.

753
00:51:41,398 --> 00:51:44,094
What? No!
You guys are crazy.

754
00:51:44,167 --> 00:51:46,135
<i>Don't front, Lina.</i>

755
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:49,963
<i>She don't need to. She's already
got Evan's nose wide open.</i>

756
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:51,871
Whatever.
You know. For real, though.

757
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:55,105
<i>That boy's nose is so open you could
drive a truck up those nostrils.</i>

758
00:51:56,613 --> 00:51:58,706
<i>What's this?
It's a shoe-vite.</i>

759
00:51:59,182 --> 00:52:03,346
<i>I'm having a RDD party
and I want you guys to come.</i>

760
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:09,491
<i>Look, Avery isn't in charge of the
social order at Malibu Vista. I am.</i>

761
00:52:09,559 --> 00:52:12,585
And despite the little debacle
at the game the other day,

762
00:52:12,662 --> 00:52:17,395
everyone can see that Lina is
making the Sea Lions fabulente!

763
00:52:17,467 --> 00:52:19,662
Everybody is talking
about it. So...

764
00:52:22,205 --> 00:52:26,801
See you there?
And, please, dress to excess!
