00:00:30,693 --> 00:00:33,267
Where I see myself in ten years?

2
00:00:34,785 --> 00:00:41,557
I want you to live well
with my wife.

3
00:00:42,654 --> 00:00:45,788
Where I see myself in ten years ...

00:00:46,093 --> 00:00:52,163

Los Angeles, California.

00:01:07,938 --> 00:01:10,444
8 March 1997.

7
00:01:18,679 --> 00:01:21,618
Just expect you to listen to the album.
Congratulations.

8
00:01:25,236 --> 00:01:27,443
Yes!

9
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:30,644
B.I.G., let's change the world.

10
00:01:37,216 --> 00:01:38,757
Let's go!

11
00:01:51,162 --> 00:01:52,995
We returned.
We returned.

12
00:01:53,316 --> 00:01:55,754
Back to the top.

13
00:01:57,564 --> 00:01:59,608
What are you, fetiþo?
What are you doing?

14
00:01:59,644 --> 00:02:00,972
Hi, boys.

15
00:02:00,973 --> 00:02:03,523
You are moved to, gagico!
Give me your phone number?

16
00:02:07,134 --> 00:02:11,073
In the beginning God he has tarnished the
face in a clean way.

17
00:02:21,545 --> 00:02:24,302
But you knew that I can stay "clean"
where I grew up.

18
00:02:24,574 --> 00:02:25,999
If you are a regular and nuit and job

19
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,921
you flout
gangsters in the making

20
00:02:27,922 --> 00:02:29,773
and white fetiþelor
courtyard of the school.

21
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,423

- Great to see you take!

22
00:02:32,424 --> 00:02:33,961
Top faimo May and

23
00:02:35,695 --> 00:02:38,693
Kurtis Blow is the best!

24
00:02:53,209 --> 00:02:54,538
Hi.

25
00:02:54,762 --> 00:02:56,972
Want an autograph from
which will appear in a day in the magazine?

26
00:02:57,184 --> 00:02:58,595
Christopher will not appear
in any magazine.

27
00:02:58,596 --> 00:03:01,339
It is fat, black and boor.

28
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,042
I do not even wear braces.

29
00:03:08,695 --> 00:03:12,569
Well.
Watch it and learned a lot ...

30
00:03:12,872 --> 00:03:17,543
always gives everything you best
and look what happens. Note 10.

31
00:03:18,741 --> 00:03:22,181
- We are proud of you, Chrissy Pooh.
- I tell you a.

32
00:03:22,405 --> 00:03:25,790
I forgot.
Now you're big.

33
00:03:26,049 --> 00:03:30,282
Mom came from a time he's in Jamaica
where night is allow parties door unlocked.

34
00:03:31,526 --> 00:03:34,941
But in our neighborhood
the only time I let you roam

35
00:03:35,133 --> 00:03:37,210
was when I went home
from school.

36
00:03:38,064 --> 00:03:41,158
You want to see something different?

37
00:03:41,413 --> 00:03:44,483
That was Brooklyn, "are the residency or die"
"Best as the pan.

38
00:03:44,984 --> 00:03:47,960
And his mother could not protect me
even all that shit.

39
00:03:50,314 --> 00:03:52,364
Hi.

40
00:03:56,729 --> 00:04:01,687
Christopher ... welcomes your father.

41
00:04:04,525 --> 00:04:06,525
Sugar.

42
00:04:17,933 --> 00:04:22,840
$ 100?
Just so worth?

43
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:27,097
Have you even
to be part of his life?

44
00:04:27,299 --> 00:04:30,429
- Things are complicated.
- Things!

45
00:04:30,595 --> 00:04:32,040
Us feel that we could ...

46
00:04:32,784 --> 00:04:36,713
It was easy to minþi I wife.
But when it comes to about your son ...

47
00:04:36,915 --> 00:04:39,492
things are complicated.

48
00:04:41,225 --> 00:04:42,964
Bye.

49
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,062
You forgot something.

50
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:20,986
Will not come back, right?

51
00:05:21,881 --> 00:05:25,086
No, I think.

52
00:05:25,824 --> 00:05:28,216
Good, good!

53
00:05:30,928 --> 00:05:32,805
Come here.

54
00:05:42,109 --> 00:05:45,518
We'll be fine.
Only two of us.

55
00:05:47,936 --> 00:05:49,718
<i>You  not me you're father. </ i></i>

56
00:05:49,965 --> 00:05:52,409
<i> You are just a nigga fiþoasã. </ i></i>

57
00:05:52,636 --> 00:05:55,891
<i> Mom I do not want money
So you run. </ i></i>

58
00:05:59,557 --> 00:06:02,821
<i> It hurts me
because you must recognize you ...</ i></i>

59
00:06:03,312 --> 00:06:07,230
<i> I need you in my life
because you're nothing! </ i></i>

60
00:06:21,179 --> 00:06:25,983
At that point I decided
stop being a child gander.

61
00:06:36,777 --> 00:06:39,222
I knew that life is a miserable game.

62
00:06:39,446 --> 00:06:43,244
And you knew that D-Roc was sufficiently
fucking like to go learn the rules.

63
00:06:43,773 --> 00:06:46,080
Howzit, D-Roc?

64
00:06:46,809 --> 00:06:49,039
He left in the end your mother
to exit?

65
00:06:49,248 --> 00:06:51,907
I told you I'll come.
Do not keep me locked in her house.

66
00:06:52,104 --> 00:06:54,124
So you're ready to go
among the mecherilor?

67
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:56,648
What should I do?

68
00:06:58,518 --> 00:07:01,202
You remember you.
Behave yourself like baþi cuba.

69
00:07:10,093 --> 00:07:12,333
Phone rings.

70
00:07:19,543 --> 00:07:22,307
That bastard is alesese
with the first dose of the day

71
00:07:22,764 --> 00:07:25,830
and I'm alesesem with money
from my first sale.

72
00:07:26,051 --> 00:07:29,747
When I was about 17 years ...
was not an ordinary boy and nuit.

73
00:07:30,147 --> 00:07:31,386
I was paid.

74
00:07:31,604 --> 00:07:33,985
Still asleep, Christopher?

75
00:07:35,869 --> 00:07:37,377
How are you, Christopher?

76
00:07:38,771 --> 00:07:40,710
Pray?

77
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:43,777
Just to buy
a frog on the door.

78
00:07:44,013 --> 00:07:45,968
Do not fool with it.

79
00:07:46,293 --> 00:07:48,033
You do not believe that God has felt humor?

80
00:07:48,034 --> 00:07:50,427
Must have
if he did you.

81
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:56,949
For asculþi always this rubbish
country music?

82
00:07:57,163 --> 00:08:00,550
I like this kind of music,
are some stories are beautiful.

83
00:08:00,745 --> 00:08:03,917
Who spoke on the phone
last night?

84
00:08:03,918 --> 00:08:04,882
With Jane.

85
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:08,726
It is perfectly normal
as a mother to feel jealous ...

86
00:08:08,957 --> 00:08:10,832
when her baby is interested
of another woman.

87
00:08:11,525 --> 00:08:15,092
- To God ...
- Stay, mother.

88
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,007
- What?
- How much like a scavenger pan?

89
00:08:17,194 --> 00:08:19,923
- Any $ 28,000 per year. Why?
- No reason.

90
00:08:20,131 --> 00:08:22,944
You can not rush the late
both classes?

91
00:08:29,023 --> 00:08:31,369
You must see this weekend.

92
00:09:13,891 --> 00:09:18,622
3x other term in the equations.
Who can solve the problem?

93
00:09:23,117 --> 00:09:25,233
Stand up, Mr Wallace.

94
00:09:31,413 --> 00:09:38,256
7x = 84
X = 12

95
00:09:40,042 --> 00:09:44,212
Impressive, you're smarter
than you look.

96
00:09:45,199 --> 00:09:48,435
Mr. Welber told me yesterday
I get that scavenger.

97
00:09:48,619 --> 00:09:49,728
Yes.

98
00:09:49,911 --> 00:09:52,307
If you chiuse from school
that you get.

99
00:09:52,635 --> 00:09:58,301
I learned that a teacher
As pan $ 24,000 a year ...

100
00:09:58,514 --> 00:10:02,828
and a scavenger like the frying pan
$ 28,000 per year.

101
00:10:03,434 --> 00:10:08,942
I bring you with 4000 $
more than him.

102
00:10:13,229 --> 00:10:16,760
Exit out of my class!

103
00:10:31,955 --> 00:10:34,833
- Thank you that I expected you to.
- I knew that you'll like.

104
00:10:35,289 --> 00:10:38,716
If mom sees phone bill
I will kill you.

105
00:10:38,954 --> 00:10:42,378
When you see all those phones ...

106
00:10:49,873 --> 00:10:52,401
I'm pregnant.

107
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:57,770
I went and the doctor.

108
00:10:59,508 --> 00:11:01,531
We have a baby!

109
00:11:07,154 --> 00:11:09,424
- Damn!
- Hell?

110
00:11:11,684 --> 00:11:13,476
That's all?

111
00:11:13,667 --> 00:11:15,709
I'm waiting to enjoy fashion,

112
00:11:15,887 --> 00:11:18,464
but if I knock this world
then I apologize.

113
00:11:18,927 --> 00:11:21,872
Sit down, dear.
To talk.

114
00:11:27,912 --> 00:11:31,294
My son segment,
you're my whole world.

115
00:11:33,786 --> 00:11:36,112
I not going to say "fuck"?

116
00:11:36,346 --> 00:11:39,506
No, I do.
You'll know that we care about you.

117
00:11:39,753 --> 00:11:42,326
- We take care of me?
- You are my girlfriend.

118
00:12:01,714 --> 00:12:04,045
- Hi, D-Roc.
- What's up?

119
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:09,679
- You are OK?
- Yes, well.

120
00:12:11,081 --> 00:12:13,309
To make money.

121
00:12:15,927 --> 00:12:18,283
D-Roc and I work very well
together.

122
00:12:18,512 --> 00:12:21,234
Street and 40 was our field.

123
00:12:27,186 --> 00:12:31,901
But once in a while D-Roc said:
"put a little"?

124
00:12:33,633 --> 00:12:35,586
Traffic was my wife.

125
00:12:35,954 --> 00:12:37,948
Rap was an occasional lover.

126
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:40,820
Before my account is gone
news about what I can skin,

127
00:12:40,821 --> 00:12:43,256
and a least you named Primo
I provoked a duel.

128
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,228
Everyone was moved to him,
not because they never lost.

129
00:12:47,492 --> 00:12:49,327
One was to do for lyrics
ga, and that your

130
00:12:49,328 --> 00:12:51,259
Battle but this was something else.

131
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:56,497
- I see that no longer run.
- Better 'n you meliþa wrong.

132
00:13:00,144 --> 00:13:03,487
Come on, clear it away.
That want to see?

133
00:13:04,265 --> 00:13:06,321
I want to see me
and the "Big Boy"?

134
00:13:06,322 --> 00:13:08,122
I'm MC Quess.
That 's me, MC Quess.

135
00:13:09,009 --> 00:13:13,339
We know who will like the pan.
Hey, DJ, a cool place.

136
00:13:14,693 --> 00:13:18,344
Go and get you some fried chicken
until done.

137
00:13:18,345 --> 00:13:21,695
<i> Let me tell you a story

00:15:20,262 --> 00:15:25,341
Look, Mom. I tried.
I missed a few days.

171
00:15:25,568 --> 00:15:29,112
But then I was three full weeks.
They come in two "careers day".

172
00:15:29,447 --> 00:15:33,432
An IT and a doctor.
And there were some losers împuþiþi!

173
00:15:33,944 --> 00:15:35,640
Take care how you talk!

174
00:15:35,831 --> 00:15:38,338
I do not see me going to school
and that reaching them!

175
00:15:38,565 --> 00:15:40,170
Now I have something to do.

176
00:15:40,383 --> 00:15:41,986
What the hell does that mean?

177
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:44,073
Jane is pregnant.
I will be father.

178
00:15:50,153 --> 00:15:53,680
Please tell me
not that you're so stupid.

179
00:15:54,272 --> 00:15:55,898
Why?

180
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:58,992
Because you're still a Baietel!

181
00:15:59,191 --> 00:16:01,903
To think that I came to the U.S.?

182
00:16:02,138 --> 00:16:04,791
I like to spend every day
taking care of you,

183
00:16:04,985 --> 00:16:09,802
feeding back and curãþând
piureul potatoes left under the bed?

184
00:16:10,285 --> 00:16:13,733
You can not take care of you no însuþi!
How can you care for a child?

185
00:16:14,082 --> 00:16:15,034
Where is the plate?

186
00:16:15,169 --> 00:16:17,984
I threw her to the dogs,
it was disgusting!

187
00:16:20,236 --> 00:16:21,588
- Damn!
- What are you doing?

188
00:16:21,922 --> 00:16:24,350
That was not mashed potatoes!
Damn!

189
00:16:27,993 --> 00:16:29,525
Look at me!

190
00:16:29,737 --> 00:16:32,027
I said to you uiþi at me!

191
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:36,854
Trying to tell me what I think?

192
00:16:41,436 --> 00:16:47,100
I like to get those vagrants neisprãviþi
which century I do not see this?

193
00:16:47,419 --> 00:16:50,422
Vagabonzii not lanþuri and no money!
I am man!

194
00:16:54,325 --> 00:16:56,811
I think that makes you to be man?

195
00:16:58,589 --> 00:17:01,505
- Exit out.
- Mother?

196
00:17:01,964 --> 00:17:04,162
Exit out.

197
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:24,682
I was not the man
that his mother and wanted to become.

198
00:17:25,835 --> 00:17:27,653
It's so shit.

199
00:17:27,887 --> 00:17:29,956
Then after you become husband
I felt that it should be.

200
00:17:29,957 --> 00:17:31,918
<i> When you die
I want to go to hell </ i></i>

201
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:34,680

204
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:48,424
- Hi, B.I.G.

205
00:17:48,681 --> 00:17:51,070
See you do not take your eyes police.

206
00:17:51,271 --> 00:17:52,853
- Man, state, and I ...

207
00:17:53,043 --> 00:17:56,281

211
00:18:17,469 --> 00:18:19,345
Thanks, man.

212
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:26,562
- Hey, T, can take you to hell!
- And I love you, Sandy.

213
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:28,737
I have sold drugs to a pregnant woman.

214
00:18:28,996 --> 00:18:32,126
Fuck that, we entered
in ga and that as to be social.

215
00:18:35,303 --> 00:18:39,334
I got tired of work and mãrunþi,
so we increased that stake game.

216
00:18:47,465 --> 00:18:50,664
Scosesem 40 ° bevel on the streets.

217
00:18:51,481 --> 00:18:54,474
Look at you, you're a man.

218
00:18:54,706 --> 00:18:57,018
Shut the fuck up
and look out the door a.

219
00:18:57,743 --> 00:19:01,267
No exit eam with bãieþii.
I play the fool by women.

220
00:19:01,823 --> 00:19:04,093
I was too busy counting banknotes.

221
00:19:05,062 --> 00:19:08,437
But he moved too fast as
and we blew it.

222
00:19:12,707 --> 00:19:18,085
<i>You  a call to reverse the fee

223
00:19:19,723 --> 00:19:22,874
- Mother?
- Damn you, Christopher.

224
00:19:23,547 --> 00:19:26,878
I did a sheep.
I need your help.

225
00:19:27,097 --> 00:19:31,154
No. Alone you put into it,
all alone can solve.

226
00:19:32,402 --> 00:19:34,392
You can not even
to pray for me?

227
00:19:34,555 --> 00:19:36,882
I have never ceased
I can pray for you,

228
00:19:36,883 --> 00:19:38,902
but you must stop to consume more are
while God

229
00:19:38,903 --> 00:19:40,258
and to pray alone.

230
00:19:45,793 --> 00:19:48,714
Close your eyes, Christopher.

231
00:19:50,423 --> 00:19:56,390

234
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:11,395
I am ready to accept
the presence of my Lord.

Whether that goodness and His mercy

236
00:20:17,543 --> 00:20:20,529
Alone you put into it,
all alone can solve.

237
00:20:20,707 --> 00:20:25,515
For the first time in my life
I felt dead.

238
00:20:27,737 --> 00:20:29,775
I started to write
because they simply bore me

239
00:20:29,962 --> 00:20:33,457
Then my own thoughts
were turned into lyrics ...

240
00:20:33,621 --> 00:20:35,902
and those lyrics
said my story.

241
00:21:03,568 --> 00:21:06,622
Christopher, have a fetita.

00:21:06,623 --> 00:21:08,703

<i>How is  to be father

245
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:27,016
Welcome home.

246
00:21:36,742 --> 00:21:39,713
- Where is it?
- Well ...

247
00:21:52,896 --> 00:21:54,851
Give me that.

248
00:21:56,985 --> 00:22:01,230
Tyanna welcomes your father!

249
00:22:04,594 --> 00:22:06,281

250
00:22:09,305 --> 00:22:12,616
No, no, no. I a. ..

251
00:22:20,516 --> 00:22:24,170
What happened, mother?
It's not even so ugly.

252
00:22:34,876 --> 00:22:39,859
Chris?
Let him be a great father.

253
00:22:41,703 --> 00:22:44,043
I hope to.

254
00:22:52,689 --> 00:22:54,720
Look who came back.

255
00:22:55,651 --> 00:22:58,386
It's Chris!
What are you, Chris?

256
00:22:58,585 --> 00:23:00,734
But you?

257
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:03,746
- We closely with all.
- We know now that you're daddy.

258
00:23:04,057 --> 00:23:06,996
It's your daddy?
What are you, a white fetita?

259
00:23:07,878 --> 00:23:10,301
Thank God
that looks to her mother.

260
00:23:10,759 --> 00:23:13,658
- Look who's here.
- What are you doing?

261
00:23:14,506 --> 00:23:17,092
I hope that you remember you
how to smoke it.

262
00:23:17,441 --> 00:23:21,519
Sure.
I like to watch.

263
00:23:26,158 --> 00:23:28,910
Now that you exit it from the cooler,
what are you going to do?

264
00:23:29,287 --> 00:23:32,091
That had a daughter I had
I think I can change.

265
00:23:32,295 --> 00:23:34,559
I did something important.

266
00:23:34,826 --> 00:23:37,405
But if I could maintain the
was as if you were in jail.

267
00:23:37,606 --> 00:23:40,744
I will do what it does normally.

268

- Do not take me guess.
- Only say that I have knowledge.

00:24:43,585 --> 00:24:45,828
Then put a box.

What is your theme?

320

I want to tell you stories about blacks
in Brooklyn, understand?

What kind of life going.

322

Still sell drugs?

I'm not a gangster, just trying to make money.

324
00:27:06,444 --> 00:27:09,887
My business has contact with the streets,
but is not in the streets.

325
00:27:10,152 --> 00:27:13,240
And no I do not want artists who are to reach

Put me.

run after the fulfillment of your dream.

I started as assistant
and I got to be the director.

Nigga, I'm hungry!
I can throw my ass naked in the jungle ...

With all due respect, Puff.
Dreams do not pay the bills.

334
00:27:36,284 --> 00:27:39,630
He's paying them.
I do not know what to say to you that in the ila,

335
00:27:39,861 --> 00:27:41,337
but if I throw myself into the jungle

336
00:27:41,338 --> 00:27:43,236
I'll make you dance nenorociþi.

337
00:27:45,932 --> 00:27:51,108
Maybe in the hands of the be ...
one of the best.

338
00:27:54,394 --> 00:27:57,175
- How many years?
- 19 years.

339
00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:01,494
Until the 21 years I will be millionaire.

340
00:28:01,865 --> 00:28:05,074
We can change the world, Biggie Smalls.
Can we change the rules.

341
00:28:05,589 --> 00:28:10,404
West Coast it has Snoop, Dre
and the Cube. We kill.

342
00:28:10,818 --> 00:28:15,298
The East Coast still wait on someone
choice I belong.

343
00:28:15,506 --> 00:28:19,361
Can be black or can of Brooklyn
made about blacks in Brooklyn.

344
00:28:19,557 --> 00:28:24,151
You choose, streets or the studio.
Te bagi?

345
00:28:35,818 --> 00:28:37,982
What are you, Big Mama?

346
00:28:39,939 --> 00:28:41,739
What did you say?

347
00:28:43,254 --> 00:28:44,751
Big Mama.

348
00:28:45,953 --> 00:28:48,710
Great show.
How goes?

349
00:28:48,903 --> 00:28:51,784
Every day I wonder how you do.
What is it?

350
00:28:51,965 --> 00:28:54,648
The problem is that I care.
You know what I mean?

351
00:28:54,841 --> 00:28:57,792
Yes, as you say, "Big Papa".

352
00:28:58,048 --> 00:29:01,256
- You filthy mouth.
- And you want to do something about the this?

353
00:29:07,463 --> 00:29:09,210
I think not.

354
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:11,939
Wait.

355
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:18,944
Want something to eat?

356
00:29:24,512 --> 00:29:27,046
Shit! Yes! Yes!

357
00:29:31,753 --> 00:29:33,941
Why do not you come over?

358
00:29:49,932 --> 00:29:51,816
You seeing anyone?

359
00:29:52,354 --> 00:29:54,860
It's too late to ask this.

360
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:04,062
I saw someone.

361
00:30:04,944 --> 00:30:07,885
It is often thought about Mike Tyson.

362
00:30:10,294 --> 00:30:12,188
You will not make anyone worse
ever.

363
00:30:12,913 --> 00:30:15,154
I'll take care of you, okay?

364
00:30:25,274 --> 00:30:27,555
Big Puff.

365
00:30:27,788 --> 00:30:29,850
I sat here and we have all expected.

366
00:30:31,748 --> 00:30:35,137
- What are you doing?
- Hi, B.I.G.

367
00:30:37,912 --> 00:30:41,023
Andre said he wanted to be
one lion in the jungle.

368
00:30:43,816 --> 00:30:46,052
What the hell are you talking?

369
00:30:47,417 --> 00:30:49,518
B.I.G., I was fired.

370
00:30:49,921 --> 00:30:52,334
And my contract?

371
00:30:52,873 --> 00:30:57,991
I think I'll start.
I do not knew that you are oave bra.

372
00:30:58,765 --> 00:31:02,074
Can you arrange some concerts
by facultãþi.

373
00:31:02,075 --> 00:31:03,979
That only until successful esc
to get something real.

374
00:31:06,269 --> 00:31:12,206
B.I.G.? Dad died on the streets
when I was two years.

375
00:31:13,658 --> 00:31:16,313
You have no future there.

376
00:31:17,376 --> 00:31:20,453
Just because you're now at Earth
does not mean that you can not I back.

377
00:31:22,862 --> 00:31:25,788
What does not kill you
makes you human.

378
00:31:36,151 --> 00:31:39,948
I thought that contract and now
I have no what buy diapers.

379
00:31:40,859 --> 00:31:42,469
Must take over.

380
00:31:42,664 --> 00:31:46,109
- Parc steady traffic.
- It's a thought, and me.

381
00:31:54,529 --> 00:31:56,293
Shit!

382
00:32:13,269 --> 00:32:15,492
There is one.
Send a unit after him.

383
00:32:17,016 --> 00:32:18,885
You have no where to run.

384
00:32:20,964 --> 00:32:22,874
Do not make things.

385
00:32:23,721 --> 00:32:26,610
Do you see my hands.
Come on, hands.

386
00:32:26,914 --> 00:32:29,563
Show me your hands
and drop the gun.

387
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:40,090
When I was little, if you had
cuþit box and were considered a bad guy.

388
00:32:40,267 --> 00:32:43,204
Now you know least 13 years and that it impui
traficanþii on the street corner

389
00:32:43,205 --> 00:32:44,683
that can take place.

390
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:47,223
What is the world choose

391
00:32:47,387 --> 00:32:49,611
when no drug traficanþii
may not be walking the streets at night?

392
00:32:50,531 --> 00:32:55,219
Tell me, Chris, what's your first:
socks, clothes ... gun?

393
00:32:55,369 --> 00:32:57,407
I have never seen that gun.

394
00:32:58,775 --> 00:33:01,121
Then it should be yours.

395
00:33:02,735 --> 00:33:06,310
One of you will be arrested
for carrying a gun.

396
00:33:06,465 --> 00:33:07,902
I do not care which.

397
00:33:08,093 --> 00:33:12,494
But in any case will not be delivered
both.

398
00:33:17,166 --> 00:33:19,336
We put down a second.

399
00:33:25,159 --> 00:33:26,525
We try to collect the door a.

400
00:33:26,734 --> 00:33:28,758
A search to secure fingerprints.

401
00:33:28,967 --> 00:33:32,122
- You invent something then.
- There will be too late.

402
00:33:33,215 --> 00:33:37,707
You criminal, you will condemn
at least 5 or 6 years.

403
00:33:39,049 --> 00:33:43,284
If you leave me guilty
I will give only 3 years in prison.

404
00:33:43,538 --> 00:33:47,267
- Absolutely not.
- Fuck!

405
00:33:48,177 --> 00:33:52,619
Not everybody gets
where did you get it.

406
00:33:52,829 --> 00:33:56,349
When a miscreant like you go somewhere
and we get time with him.

407
00:33:58,077 --> 00:33:59,982
And if you do not succeed esc?

408
00:34:00,187 --> 00:34:03,280
Listen, I've learned
how to make the drug business.

409
00:34:03,432 --> 00:34:06,199
Now I say to renunþi.

410
00:34:06,341 --> 00:34:11,095
Want a contract? Search one!
But do not go back on the streets!

411
00:34:11,976 --> 00:34:16,979
You can do something
and now I'll put your ass to safety.

412
00:34:18,625 --> 00:34:20,752
So I do it.

413
00:34:26,766 --> 00:34:28,910
So?

414
00:34:32,315 --> 00:34:35,214
I put the osetele first
bastard.

415
00:34:38,767 --> 00:34:40,549
Well.

416
00:34:42,624 --> 00:34:44,759
Come on, clear it away.

417
00:35:00,696 --> 00:35:02,324
What is B.I.G.? You are okay?

418
00:35:02,501 --> 00:35:07,293
I want to leave this motherfucker,
my life is at stake, you know?

419
00:35:07,487 --> 00:35:10,525
I have a fetita,
I feel that is stuck in the mud here.

420
00:35:10,714 --> 00:35:12,452
Tell Puff
that they agree to my dream of watching.

421
00:35:12,674 --> 00:35:14,343
Whatever he wants to do,
I agree.

422
00:35:14,517 --> 00:35:17,156
- But you must leave now.
- I'll tell Puff.

423
00:35:18,467 --> 00:35:20,766
I will take care of you.

424
00:35:24,546 --> 00:35:26,616

00:40:02,386 --> 00:40:04,646
Then we went to a party.

492

It was crazy.

493
00:40:06,661 --> 00:40:09,015

- And I respect all fraþii.
- What are you, B.I.G.?

495
00:40:12,806 --> 00:40:15,063

because when you get up
start shit.

497
00:40:18,286 --> 00:40:20,452

00:40:23,093 --> 00:40:25,095
See you later, B.I.G.

501
00:40:37,869 --> 00:40:40,170

00:40:58,926 --> 00:41:02,292
You have a beautiful voice.

What?

504
00:41:05,383 --> 00:41:08,246
- Like to laugh?
- I will not kid you.

505
00:41:09,753 --> 00:41:11,517
Not even in front of you.

I want to hear something sexy

516
00:41:47,299 --> 00:41:49,966

528
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,904
- What do you like?

529
00:42:38,210 --> 00:42:40,563
- I understand what you do.
- There are, however, a man.

530
00:42:40,758 --> 00:42:44,129
Come here any time at night ...
She called Jane.

531
00:42:45,114 --> 00:42:46,663
Are you gonna rupi
and your daughter?

532
00:42:46,861 --> 00:42:48,694
You are too busy
to see her.

533
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,149
Not working.

534
00:42:50,353 --> 00:42:53,015
And start to wonder
in the end what you do.

535
00:42:53,487 --> 00:42:55,192
Everything is under control.

536
00:42:55,396 --> 00:42:58,918
What kind of man in all of nature
and they say "Puffy"?

537
00:42:59,688 --> 00:43:03,139
It's absolutely ridiculous.
Not even does not have a job.

538
00:43:03,315 --> 00:43:05,706
Why not you?

539
00:43:07,397 --> 00:43:08,910
Sorry, Ms. Wallace.

540
00:43:09,216 --> 00:43:12,115
Please can you let me explain
with what has taken Chris.

541
00:43:12,315 --> 00:43:14,773
Please ... I want to hear.

542
00:43:15,077 --> 00:43:16,590
Yes, lady.

543
00:43:17,612 --> 00:43:21,018
Your son has something special.

544
00:43:21,195 --> 00:43:23,718
Sometimes this will mean working
hard, until the night

545
00:43:23,719 --> 00:43:25,284
but I believe that efforts
will be rewarded.

546
00:43:28,674 --> 00:43:32,275
If you see that and not take work
seriously, we will announce it first.

547
00:43:35,545 --> 00:43:38,610
We understand to be my agent.

548
00:43:40,790 --> 00:43:42,702
Okay then.

549
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:47,608
And if you want to feel responsible
believe me, so I will consider.

550
00:43:49,325 --> 00:43:50,753
Yes, lady.

551
00:43:50,944 --> 00:43:54,613
- You can talk to Chris.
- Yes, ma'am.

552
00:44:10,051 --> 00:44:13,318
My doctor found a tumor in breast.

553
00:44:14,991 --> 00:44:16,505
What?

554
00:44:16,691 --> 00:44:18,183
I will work next week ...

555
00:44:18,356 --> 00:44:21,259
Should be aggressively
if we want to and any chance.

556
00:44:21,456 --> 00:44:23,803
"If" ... What does this mean?

557
00:44:23,952 --> 00:44:26,113
- I want to be honest with you, Chris.
- No, mother.

558
00:44:26,328 --> 00:44:27,499
No, listen.

559
00:44:27,755 --> 00:44:31,698
You want to know ...
Christopher? Please.

560
00:44:40,509 --> 00:44:43,913
I have so many ideas in my head
that I toss all night.

561
00:44:44,306 --> 00:44:45,906
I can ...

562
00:44:46,751 --> 00:44:49,792
I thought about my cousin, Wayne.
It's very expect.

563
00:44:50,009 --> 00:44:52,520
I think you call it
help me.

564
00:44:52,765 --> 00:44:54,809
I think I will like, B.I.G.

565
00:44:57,989 --> 00:44:59,783
Do what you want.

566
00:45:01,304 --> 00:45:05,311
B.I.G.? B.I.G.?
Want to talk about it?

567
00:45:06,497 --> 00:45:08,998
- About what?
- What panic.

568
00:45:09,267 --> 00:45:12,077
You said nothing about two days.

569
00:45:12,514 --> 00:45:15,695
My mom has breast cancer.
I know how to cure?

570
00:45:22,554 --> 00:45:26,670
No. I think not.

571
00:45:29,563 --> 00:45:33,068
I was only 15 years when my mother
died of cancer.

572
00:45:35,978 --> 00:45:40,358
- How did you do?
- I want to talk about.

573
00:45:44,376 --> 00:45:47,874
B.I.G., look, I know that pass
through a difficult period ...

574
00:45:50,022 --> 00:45:52,987
but you must be strong
for mom.

575
00:45:53,994 --> 00:45:56,832
Must be near her,
can susþii.

576
00:45:57,127 --> 00:46:00,007
I will pray for your mother, B.I.G.

577
00:46:11,910 --> 00:46:14,101
So I teþi knowledge?

578
00:46:15,671 --> 00:46:17,981
Maybe some are with us.

579
00:46:18,166 --> 00:46:22,512
What does not kill you makes you a man.
For the record label Bad Boy.

580
00:46:29,409 --> 00:46:32,158
Puff?

581
00:46:32,384 --> 00:46:33,568
I want to talk.

582
00:46:35,181 --> 00:46:36,531
What is your mother?

583
00:46:36,714 --> 00:46:39,208
Better, just a day school.

584
00:46:39,402 --> 00:46:42,552
Puff,
thing with Bad Boy is good?

585
00:46:42,914 --> 00:46:44,868
Let me show you something.

586
00:46:45,213 --> 00:46:47,737
I took that to Clive Davis.

587
00:46:47,935 --> 00:46:51,355
A face, Biggie Smalls.
Second front, Craig Mack.

588
00:46:51,356 --> 00:46:52,381
B.I.G. Mack.

589
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:57,144
It B.I.G. Mack. You understand?
What can you say? Open it.

590
00:47:02,575 --> 00:47:05,188
Welcome to Bad Boy.

591
00:48:25,781 --> 00:48:28,116
It's tough.
I like it.

592
00:48:28,305 --> 00:48:30,603
It will be my first single.

593
00:48:30,828 --> 00:48:32,700
I want to hear.

594
00:48:59,086 --> 00:49:00,811
Understand what I mean?

595
00:49:01,088 --> 00:49:04,190
Trying to make him jump on the chairs.
O to be like soul music!

596
00:49:04,537 --> 00:49:07,286
I think to laugh about it.

597
00:49:07,455 --> 00:49:10,517
If you do this, one you can laugh
and you'll fill the money!

598
00:49:10,795 --> 00:49:13,857
What next?
I'll make you dance like MC Hammer?

599
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:16,731
Leave them on those with life in the neighborhood
for face B.

600
00:49:16,904 --> 00:49:18,253
If you do not have anything that
to be broadcast on the radio,

601
00:49:18,254 --> 00:49:20,644
No one will hear of your album.

602
00:49:20,756 --> 00:49:24,735
You'll be just a broke rapper.
Trust me.

603
00:49:25,148 --> 00:49:30,942
Puff is right.
And many put money in the studio.

604
00:49:32,905 --> 00:49:36,080
Ã º tia looks like Rick James.

605
00:49:36,656 --> 00:49:41,392
- Please ...
- Do what you want.

606
00:49:42,026 --> 00:49:45,758
Come back in a few hours.
We will prepare something before then.

607
00:49:49,154 --> 00:49:53,931
I need Pepsi
and still some grass.

608
00:49:54,092 --> 00:49:57,085
And for some chicks.
Tell them that give a party.

609
00:49:57,247 --> 00:49:58,655
And the weather was.
I'm back soon.

610
00:49:58,921 --> 00:50:00,490
To hear once
thing.

611
00:50:14,253 --> 00:50:19,639
- To find the money.
- Look at him.

612
00:50:20,301 --> 00:50:23,288
Big Mama is looking for you on the phone.

613
00:50:24,954 --> 00:50:26,964
Not now.

614
00:50:27,794 --> 00:50:30,148
Okay, man.
I understood.

615
00:50:34,544 --> 00:50:37,155
B.I.G., out of some lyrics?

616
00:50:37,325 --> 00:50:39,381
I need inspiraþie.

617
00:50:51,471 --> 00:50:53,392
Get in the studio.
I wait Puff.

618
00:50:53,566 --> 00:50:56,432
Come on, man, you wake up.
To make that piece.

Puffy gave him pulse necessary.

649
00:52:22,179 --> 00:52:25,102
As I say we,

650
00:52:25,103 --> 00:52:28,606
a track that led to 100%
to 200%.

651
00:52:28,607 --> 00:52:31,929
Some have said that reinforced
the funk in hip-hop.

652
00:52:31,930 --> 00:52:33,562
I know just ...

653
00:52:33,563 --> 00:52:35,730
what it's made of.

654
00:52:36,112 --> 00:52:39,681

So you're a bad guy who wants

I am a man who tries to be successful.

00:58:41,654 --> 00:58:43,229
- Want to duel?
- I can make you dust.

725
00:58:45,296 --> 00:58:46,566
Take care with this.

Why not go to it and do it?

732
00:59:14,015 --> 00:59:15,981
- What to do?
- To make you laugh.

733
00:59:17,735 --> 00:59:19,247
Can I be me

01:06:09,165 --> 01:06:11,754
- You need to ask?
- I'm in the Elam.

830
01:06:11,789 --> 01:06:15,710
Mark knew a girl and will
sitting in my apartment tonight

831
01:06:16,316 --> 01:06:18,101
so you do not call me.

832
01:06:20,555 --> 01:06:23,034
I and the Mark
You can use the camera?

833
01:06:23,488 --> 01:06:26,928
- Yes, why?
- Sounds pretty pathetic, is all.

834
01:06:27,323 --> 01:06:30,619
Maybe that's silly,
but my buddy.

835
01:06:33,338 --> 01:06:35,274
Agreed. I love you.

836
01:06:36,060 --> 01:06:37,543
And I love you, Faith.

837
01:06:48,697 --> 01:06:50,458
- Hi.
- You can take care of Shine?

838
01:07:03,884 --> 01:07:05,126
Yes?

839
01:07:05,701 --> 01:07:07,576
- Housekeeping.
- No, thank you.

840
01:07:09,601 --> 01:07:11,688
Scuzaþi me, lady,
but you do not hear through the door.

841
01:07:13,019 --> 01:07:14,410
I said: "No, thank you."

842
01:07:16,407 --> 01:07:17,436
- Shit!
- What the hell?

843
01:07:17,799 --> 01:07:20,249
Damn! A wait.

844
01:07:22,245 --> 01:07:23,365
Cãþea!

845
01:07:23,909 --> 01:07:27,539
Wait!
Not what you tiut!

846
01:07:29,415 --> 01:07:36,369
But you should have you know.

847
01:07:36,404 --> 01:07:43,324

01:08:01,339 --> 01:08:05,634

01:08:07,057 --> 01:08:09,375
<i> With all the pain and suffering </ i></i>

854
01:08:09,376 --> 01:08:13,308

857
01:08:36,543 --> 01:08:38,631
I do not know what else to do
like to be with you.

858
01:08:40,264 --> 01:08:41,964
I blew it.

859
01:08:44,928 --> 01:08:48,014
I miss home and to be
with you and with Shin.

860
01:08:51,341 --> 01:08:53,517
It was stupid.

861
01:08:58,446 --> 01:09:00,915
I won 't tread awry, Faith.

862
01:09:04,852 --> 01:09:06,153
Faith.

863
01:09:07,998 --> 01:09:10,023
I do not know what else to say.

864
01:09:12,354 --> 01:09:14,289
I just want to come home.

865
01:09:33,449 --> 01:09:35,982

866
01:09:37,222 --> 01:09:39,369
That smile of yours.

867
01:09:41,696 --> 01:09:43,483
Forgive me, Faith.

868
01:09:50,013 --> 01:09:51,948
Shit.

869
01:09:54,489 --> 01:09:55,941
Look what you did.

870
01:09:59,933 --> 01:10:01,962
I love you, Faith.

871
01:10:03,624 --> 01:10:05,288
And I love you.

872
01:10:14,891 --> 01:10:16,459
Things have settled for
me and Faith ...

873
01:10:17,215 --> 01:10:19,712
so that we left on tour.

874
01:10:20,054 --> 01:10:22,141

909
01:13:21,408 --> 01:13:22,616
Hey, B.I.G.

910
01:13:22,952 --> 01:13:24,402
What are you doing, brother?

911
01:13:24,708 --> 01:13:25,917
Good show.
How are you?

912
01:13:26,938 --> 01:13:28,518
- All right, brother.
- Good to see you.

913
01:13:29,244 --> 01:13:31,181
- You break it.
- Want to see what can?

914
01:13:32,549 --> 01:13:34,697
Pac, I have your autograph?

915
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:41,108
That you get minþi?

916
01:13:41,444 --> 01:13:43,017
- What?
- People I will autograph

917
01:13:43,439 --> 01:13:45,043
would like karate 14.

918
01:13:45,922 --> 01:13:48,491
A least you came to me
and he said that is his hero.

919
01:13:49,459 --> 01:13:53,152
But I said that Malcolm X
should be a hero,

920
01:13:53,187 --> 01:13:54,149
or Dr. King.

921
01:13:54,645 --> 01:13:57,156
That was Pac,
revoluþionar a second,

922
01:13:57,692 --> 01:13:59,301
then fucking tramp
a minute later.

923
01:14:00,029 --> 01:14:03,425
If you ask ten people what's Pac
premiums are ten different answers.

924
01:14:04,173 --> 01:14:06,562
But it was all in one place
and something more ...

925
01:14:07,772 --> 01:14:11,781
- And sometimes that was a joke.
- Give me the money.

926
01:14:14,953 --> 01:14:18,729
But what Pac said, the move to
moments are the beginning,

927
01:14:18,764 --> 01:14:22,079
because when you get to the top
you can only lower.

928
01:14:23,708 --> 01:14:28,807
Pac was right, night
at Quad studio changed everything.

929
01:14:40,791 --> 01:14:42,424
What are you, Pac?

930
01:14:44,602 --> 01:14:46,630
- What?
- Come up?

931
01:14:46,933 --> 01:14:50,808
- Yes, I work at level 12.
- I'm going to B.I.G.

932
01:14:50,843 --> 01:14:51,895
Yes.

933
01:14:57,629 --> 01:14:59,807
- B.I.G., I just saw down Pac.
- Yes?

934
01:15:00,382 --> 01:15:01,199
- Yes.
- Bring him here.

935
01:15:01,502 --> 01:15:02,834
Well.

936
01:15:03,952 --> 01:15:05,544
B.I.G. reserved all ten floor
for a record session.

937
01:15:05,545 --> 01:15:06,606
Yes? As records go?

938
01:15:07,826 --> 01:15:10,064
- Come on, you know that-and do the job.
- Ensure that work.

939
01:15:11,545 --> 01:15:13,177
Said made some bucãþi
all good, man.

940
01:15:13,178 --> 01:15:17,093
With some chicks for you to move
I'm not in the side of anything.

941
01:15:27,950 --> 01:15:28,857
Down, you bastard!

942
01:15:29,765 --> 01:15:31,248
Get back into the elevator, man.

943
01:15:34,035 --> 01:15:37,572
B.I.G., Pac is down and is robbed!
He threatened with a gun!

944
01:15:37,665 --> 01:15:39,875
- Stay here.
- I want to come with you!

945
01:15:40,450 --> 01:15:41,782
I like you here.

946
01:15:47,176 --> 01:15:48,627
Shit!

947
01:15:56,915 --> 01:15:59,123
He was attacked in the hallway.

948
01:16:00,247 --> 01:16:01,518
Pac!

949
01:16:04,600 --> 01:16:05,871
- Stay here.
- Wait!

950
01:16:06,445 --> 01:16:08,079
Shut up and raises hands!

951
01:16:08,776 --> 01:16:10,591
Somebody call a ambulanþã.
Tupac, what happened?

952
01:16:10,755 --> 01:16:12,812
Tupac not people who in the hell
to have confidence.

953
01:16:14,355 --> 01:16:15,746
Stay away from me.

954
01:16:17,833 --> 01:16:19,468
Which one of you he stretched trap?

955
01:16:20,376 --> 01:16:22,699
I'm right here, motherfucker.
What?

956
01:16:24,393 --> 01:16:29,022
For him, all people
were responsible.

957
01:16:29,566 --> 01:16:30,868
Fuck you 'to everyone!

958
01:16:31,202 --> 01:16:32,564

Give time to pass.

May take you EZE things.

976
01:17:25,703 --> 01:17:27,368

This is ...

Tupac has done jail

983
01:17:52,053 --> 01:17:53,688
I think you will be extinguished

984

But in that event,
From Death Row Records ...

985
01:17:57,902 --> 01:17:59,593
he had something else in mind.

986
01:18:03,904 --> 01:18:05,780
And I want to say something.

987
01:18:06,536 --> 01:18:10,408
Artists know that they want to remain
artists are, big stars ...

988
01:18:11,315 --> 01:18:15,490
no need to go

We must raise
top stuff.

993
01:18:37,027 --> 01:18:38,841

Pac.

1006
01:19:28,555 --> 01:19:30,482
This man has a mission

- I'm sorry, dude, it's everywhere.

1015
01:20:16,378 --> 01:20:18,314
When the singing of the choir ...

1016
01:20:19,957 --> 01:20:21,652
Go see who it is.

1017
01:20:22,161 --> 01:20:23,676
Sorry, we do not know what happens.

1018
01:20:24,008 --> 01:20:25,402
Where the hell is Faith?

1019
01:20:26,157 --> 01:20:28,692
I'm in the eli, bitch?

1020
01:20:32,072 --> 01:20:33,706
Come, I want to talk.

1021
01:20:35,642 --> 01:20:37,549
- Open the door!
- Leave me alone!

1022
01:20:39,273 --> 01:20:41,694
- Yea and there.
- Go!

1023
01:20:44,537 --> 01:20:46,684
- Faith!
- Clear it!

1024
01:20:48,349 --> 01:20:51,586
- What was in your mind?
- I thought.

1025
01:20:52,676 --> 01:20:54,278
I exit minþi of it, okay?

1026
01:20:55,034 --> 01:20:57,991
- I just want to know truth.
- The truth is that it makes Pac.

1027
01:20:58,211 --> 01:21:00,220
He wants to pull you down
once with him.

1028
01:21:00,221 --> 01:21:01,923
And you do it game B.I.G.

1029
01:21:03,717 --> 01:21:05,140
I know you got problems.

1030
01:21:05,926 --> 01:21:08,286
But I just signed
for 42 million dollars.

1031
01:21:08,920 --> 01:21:12,149
And you get five, B.I.G.
You give your foot.

1032
01:21:28,483 --> 01:21:29,875
Faith.

1033
01:21:30,784 --> 01:21:32,598
Open the door, I want to talk.

1034
01:21:34,118 --> 01:21:37,236
Open the door a.
Please, Faith.

1035
01:21:40,533 --> 01:21:42,983
You open the door?
Faith.

1036
01:21:54,297 --> 01:21:55,597
What happens?

1037
01:21:56,384 --> 01:21:57,776
Fuck you!

1038
01:21:59,379 --> 01:22:01,376
Not even not know who the hell are you.

1039
01:22:03,278 --> 01:22:04,852
You can go asculþi least?

1040
01:22:05,548 --> 01:22:06,910
Faith, listen to me.

1041
01:22:07,910 --> 01:22:09,268
It is over.

1042
01:22:09,664 --> 01:22:12,114
I'm sorry for everything.
I'm sorry for everything.

1043
01:22:12,689 --> 01:22:14,807
Why do not segment as a man
and ask me directly?

1044
01:22:16,961 --> 01:22:18,805
Okay, I wonder.

1045
01:22:19,745 --> 01:22:21,681
What happened between you and Pac?

1046
01:22:23,435 --> 01:22:27,020
I saw the House of Blues,
I did that picture ...

1047
01:22:28,047 --> 01:22:30,082
and that was it.

1048
01:22:31,634 --> 01:22:33,327
The end of the story you know.

1049
01:22:35,082 --> 01:22:36,928
- Okay.
- Maybe now you know you like ...

1050
01:22:37,232 --> 01:22:40,559
- You are you and in Elat.
- There is reason for praise, Faith,

1051
01:22:41,013 --> 01:22:43,192
but could have and ten women a day
if wanted.

1052
01:22:44,461 --> 01:22:47,458
Please do get ten,
even twenty. I do not care.

1053
01:22:48,757 --> 01:22:50,397
I wanted to call you a.

1054
01:22:59,413 --> 01:23:00,653
No.

1055
01:23:01,410 --> 01:23:02,898
Chris.

1056
01:23:05,559 --> 01:23:07,623
Do not laugh.

1057
01:23:08,506 --> 01:23:10,169
- I laugh.
- Faith ...

1058
01:23:29,570 --> 01:23:30,840
Damn.

1059
01:23:31,896 --> 01:23:33,982
- What?
- You are Notorious?

1060
01:23:34,227 --> 01:23:36,224
- Yes.
- A capeþi to what meriþi, nigga.

1061
01:23:36,618 --> 01:23:38,916
- Who are you?
- West Coast, you bastard.

1062
01:23:41,745 --> 01:23:43,016
How much are they?

1063
01:23:44,317 --> 01:23:46,555
- 44, as you said it.
- I'm not 44, shit!

1064
01:23:49,217 --> 01:23:50,790
- I'm 42, not 44!
- I ...

1065
01:23:51,064 --> 01:23:52,335
Cease, bring your car.

1066
01:23:52,728 --> 01:23:53,818
I exit with all!

1067
01:23:54,212 --> 01:23:55,935
Come on, everybody out!

1068
01:23:56,330 --> 01:23:57,662
Make the crazy.

1069
01:23:57,966 --> 01:23:59,600
- I have another much!

1070
01:24:00,204 --> 01:24:03,018
Yes! I have gre at extent it's shoes

1071
01:24:03,472 --> 01:24:05,137
Do not have time for such a thing.

1072
01:24:05,561 --> 01:24:08,310
You need to calm down, Puff.
Has a lot on my mind now.

1073
01:24:08,585 --> 01:24:10,491
I streseazã those from Death Row
the public?

1074
01:24:10,976 --> 01:24:12,964
B.I.G. not worried about that.
Not that, man.

1075
01:24:13,629 --> 01:24:14,901
Faith is pregnant.

1076
01:24:15,699 --> 01:24:17,545
How to get pregnant?
Park is despãrþiserã!

1077
01:24:18,513 --> 01:24:20,449
- So many drama tear.
- Do not go.

1078
01:24:20,813 --> 01:24:24,563
B.I.G., please don 't do that.
Do not you do that þie!

1079
01:24:24,838 --> 01:24:28,257
I have always done
what you asked.

1080
01:24:28,891 --> 01:24:31,613
I just want some nenorociþi
shoe that will suit me.

1081
01:24:37,738 --> 01:24:39,887
- And fight.
- Yes.

1082
01:24:44,031 --> 01:24:45,993
Can I get my shoes
too seriously.

1083
01:24:46,386 --> 01:24:48,178
Measure 44?
Yes, I took seriously.

1084
01:24:56,376 --> 01:24:58,947
I know that I had not been easy.

1085
01:24:59,733 --> 01:25:02,033
Pac said many things
about us.

1086
01:25:02,307 --> 01:25:04,213
The press has done all it can
that this conflict between the East Coast ...

1087
01:25:04,487 --> 01:25:05,762
and West Coast to continue ...

1088
01:25:06,096 --> 01:25:08,002
I want to be last standing.

1089
01:25:08,668 --> 01:25:10,725
And I hope and you want to
this.

1090
01:25:16,715 --> 01:25:18,415
Look, I did get to the people.

1091
01:25:19,171 --> 01:25:21,348
Are not moved to,
but I must thank you to them.

1092
01:25:23,281 --> 01:25:26,569
Look at me.

1093
01:25:27,930 --> 01:25:30,048
He and I said to you
I'll change the world?

1094
01:25:30,864 --> 01:25:33,043
We can change the world
if we change and take us.

1095
01:25:42,542 --> 01:25:44,146
Come here, you bastard!

1096
01:25:44,751 --> 01:25:46,445
West Side, you bastard!

1097
01:25:46,779 --> 01:25:48,535
Now what are you doing toady?

1098
01:25:49,653 --> 01:25:51,137
Did you attracted into the trap!

1099
01:25:51,954 --> 01:25:55,228
What about now?

1100
01:25:55,466 --> 01:25:57,244
That's why I pulled a lu 'wife!

1101
01:25:59,674 --> 01:26:01,450
Did you attracted into the trap,
motherfucker!

1102
01:26:02,947 --> 01:26:04,610
Come on.

1103
01:26:05,216 --> 01:26:07,575
- West Side, B.I.G.
- I can see you.

1104
01:26:08,817 --> 01:26:10,757
Pac and I had
to put an end to crap.

1105
01:26:11,091 --> 01:26:12,940
I had to go somewhere
to solve this shit.

1106
01:26:13,304 --> 01:26:16,300
But the truth is
mersesem that far.

1107
01:26:20,755 --> 01:26:22,021
The media went crazy.

1108
01:26:22,022 --> 01:26:25,854
Had no business with hip-hop-ul,
but wanted to sell newspapers and magazines.

1109
01:26:26,615 --> 01:26:28,581
If not New York
does not mean anything.

1110
01:26:28,582 --> 01:26:29,551
West Side is the Law.

1111
01:26:29,552 --> 01:26:31,028
We have Big.
We have all.

1112
01:26:31,029 --> 01:26:32,815
We have Pac, we got Dre ...

1113
01:26:32,816 --> 01:26:34,470
Let us put music
on the East Coast.

1114
01:26:34,471 --> 01:26:36,070
No one to hear you something
clubs in the Bronx.

1115
01:26:36,071 --> 01:26:38,172
Anyway we have created
all this shit with rap music.

1116
01:26:38,173 --> 01:26:39,277
S East Coast is the pa na!

1117
01:26:39,278 --> 01:26:40,801
Maybe they think that
were the first,

1118
01:26:40,802 --> 01:26:42,666
but we took everything
than above.

1119
01:26:42,667 --> 01:26:46,495
Tupac speaks up
what really happens

1120
01:26:46,496 --> 01:26:47,635
the streets!

1121
01:26:47,636 --> 01:26:50,456
I know that B.I.G. He pointed into the trap,
Pac that I'll pull it!

1122
01:26:52,332 --> 01:26:53,852
This is a stupid!
He drew the race?

1123
01:26:53,853 --> 01:26:56,282
Biggie has arranged all
because it bears his ill blood Pac.

1124
01:26:59,096 --> 01:27:03,627
How to believe that Pac Biggie
I would do that?

1125
01:27:03,628 --> 01:27:05,911
To hell with the West Coast!
A to receive what worth!

1126
01:27:05,912 --> 01:27:07,926
I do not care who I ã gangsters and people.

1127
01:27:08,325 --> 01:27:10,141
- To hell with the East Coast ...
- West Coast ...

1128
01:27:10,142 --> 01:27:13,439
I'm thinking about
fucking the East Coast.

1129

01:28:23,554 --> 01:28:24,999
Put him on that.

1144
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:25,938
B.I.G., what are you doing?

1145
01:28:25,939 --> 01:28:28,811
Sometimes you must înghiþi,
sometimes you must put your foot down.

1146
01:28:28,812 --> 01:28:30,015
Do not sing it on that, man!

1147
01:28:30,736 --> 01:28:31,926
Take listen here!

1148
01:28:32,279 --> 01:28:35,433
You saw how the streets.
Spuneþi their friends and shower mania:

1149
01:28:35,434 --> 01:28:38,118
Pac he warned,
but I do not believe him.

1150
01:28:38,683 --> 01:28:40,515
This song is written
months ago.

1151
01:28:40,516 --> 01:28:42,815
Probably you will not believe me,

1152
01:28:42,816 --> 01:28:44,177
maybe nobody will.

1153
01:28:44,178 --> 01:28:47,371
But honestly, I have no-Tang!

1154
01:28:47,372 --> 01:28:49,858

I have put some money aside.

1238
01:33:26,075 --> 01:33:27,518
I never did it for the money.

1239
01:33:27,519 --> 01:33:32,263
If it was vice versa, do not know
if you could do this for you.

1240
01:33:32,264 --> 01:33:37,312
If it was vice versa, do not know if I was
sufficiently strong to succeed esc.

What?

1330
01:40:03,747 --> 01:40:05,254
I did it.

1331
01:40:06,592 --> 01:40:08,074
I succeed in it.

1332
01:40:08,667 --> 01:40:10,789
Are the best!

1333
01:40:21,757 --> 01:40:22,969

1335
01:40:25,452 --> 01:40:28,138
- And where are we going?
- The International Airport of L.A.

1336
01:40:28,139 --> 01:40:31,304
- California?
- Sure. California.

1337
01:40:33,199 --> 01:40:35,219
I hate that go there.

1338
01:40:35,220 --> 01:40:38,674
I think if you go to L.A.
to end war will end.

1339
01:40:38,675 --> 01:40:41,626
And anyway, just get an album.

1340
01:40:41,627 --> 01:40:43,155
I will return home soon.

1341
01:40:46,383 --> 01:40:47,531
Mother ...

1342
01:40:48,338 --> 01:40:49,458
I'm proud of you.

1343
01:40:51,183 --> 01:40:52,555
You are proud of me?

1344
01:40:52,556 --> 01:40:54,243
Why?

1345
01:40:54,244 --> 01:40:58,049
Because you have not left cancer
to beat you.

1346
01:40:58,050 --> 01:41:01,302
Even after all
through which you passed.

1347
01:41:06,602 --> 01:41:08,034
Thanks.

1348
01:41:11,340 --> 01:41:14,095
I watch it,
Chrissy Pooh.

1349
01:41:15,141 --> 01:41:17,007
I do not like at all
when I tell you!

1350
01:41:18,827 --> 01:41:20,603
I forgot.

1351
01:41:20,604 --> 01:41:22,898
Now you grew up.

1352
01:41:24,827 --> 01:41:27,949
Rapperii on West Coast
afraid to come on the East Coast.

1353
01:41:27,950 --> 01:41:30,586
And those on the East Coast
afraid to go on the West Coast.

1354
01:41:30,587 --> 01:41:33,231
But it was time to put an end
Astoria garbage.

1355
01:41:33,232 --> 01:41:35,978
So I went to California
I like to promote the album.

1356
01:41:35,979 --> 01:41:39,227
We have seen?

1357
01:41:39,228 --> 01:41:40,851
Yeah, I saw.

1358
01:41:40,852 --> 01:41:43,213
You must remain here
to promote the album.

1359
01:41:44,569 --> 01:41:45,969
Tyanna think you can come here?

1360
01:41:47,423 --> 01:41:49,153
Maybe you could come with her mother?

1361
01:41:55,355 --> 01:41:57,125
Well.

1362
01:41:58,550 --> 01:42:00,809
I would not bother.

1363
01:42:02,894 --> 01:42:04,198
Look!
Are all countries!

1364
01:42:09,601 --> 01:42:11,147
Shit
looks damn good!

1365
01:42:11,148 --> 01:42:14,814
To write all these songs
was the most pain.

1366
01:42:23,777 --> 01:42:25,725
Coming to the party tonight with us?

1367
01:42:25,726 --> 01:42:27,454
I'm too tired.

1368
01:42:27,455 --> 01:42:29,298
People want to see you.

1369
01:42:30,655 --> 01:42:32,737
Yes.

1370
01:42:32,738 --> 01:42:35,283
<i> and delete it from L.A.
if you want to stay in your life.</i>

1371
01:42:35,284 --> 01:42:37,106
Fuck you, motherfucker!
Do not hide!

1372
01:42:40,080 --> 01:42:42,468
- Other?
- Yeah, man.

1373
01:42:51,048 --> 01:42:54,429
And why?
We are not afraid of them, not to you?

1374
01:42:54,430 --> 01:42:55,975
Tonight im out in town!

1375
01:42:57,372 --> 01:42:58,406
Okay, B.I.G.

01:43:29,601 --> 01:43:31,416
I think going to London.

1382
01:43:31,417 --> 01:43:34,012
I had to, but should
to remain here to promote the album.

1383
01:43:34,013 --> 01:43:37,851
When you come back to New York
I want to here trimiþi CJ mom.

1384
01:43:37,852 --> 01:43:40,990
I want my son
to be together with me.

1385
01:43:44,867 --> 01:43:47,489
Well.
We can fix that.

1386
01:43:47,490 --> 01:43:48,786
Talk to you later.

1387

1403
01:44:46,961 --> 01:44:50,609
We are L.A.!

1404
01:44:50,610 --> 01:44:53,154
You afraid to get here?

1405
01:44:53,155 --> 01:44:54,892
I'd like to reward them.

1406
01:44:57,982 --> 01:45:00,074
It seems that you just did it.

1407
01:45:00,075 --> 01:45:01,848
And never yet done.

1408
01:45:03,893 --> 01:45:05,402
Let's change the world, B.I.G.

1409
01:45:07,060 --> 01:45:09,897
We can change the world
if we change and take us.

1410
01:45:12,246 --> 01:45:14,519
I think all my life
trying to become man.

1411
01:45:17,032 --> 01:45:18,302
But, somehow,

1412
01:45:18,964 --> 01:45:20,520
in the evening ...

1413
01:45:20,521 --> 01:45:22,949
never had to try.

1414
01:45:26,688 --> 01:45:28,752
I was about to get
second album

1415
01:45:30,421 --> 01:45:33,086
and felt that God
me clean of sin.

1416
01:45:33,901 --> 01:45:35,360
As the start.

1417
01:45:36,263 --> 01:45:38,636
Our Party
must complete.

1418
01:45:38,637 --> 01:45:43,347
Must evacuate the building,
are five exit iri.

1419
01:45:43,348 --> 01:45:47,065
Please exit on the I floor
in order.

1420
01:46:03,350 --> 01:46:05,544
Man, are you right now
not to you?

1421
01:46:05,545 --> 01:46:08,567
You can film the demo
the morning.

1422
01:46:08,568 --> 01:46:11,058
- We go to the hotel, okay?
- Okay.

1423
01:46:19,422 --> 01:46:20,918
What are you doing?

1424
01:46:22,270 --> 01:46:24,327
I wanted to ask forgiveness.

1425
01:46:24,328 --> 01:46:26,036
When I return to New York

1426
01:46:26,037 --> 01:46:29,335
want to think well
what we do.

1427
01:46:29,336 --> 01:46:30,861
No more scenes.

1428
01:46:30,862 --> 01:46:32,631
We could do that.

1429
01:46:36,732 --> 01:46:39,238
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

1430
01:46:39,239 --> 01:46:41,718
Guess what.
I bought the car I own.

1431
01:46:41,719 --> 01:46:44,541
- What have you got, fetiþo?
- A black Lexus.

1432
01:46:44,542 --> 01:46:45,924
What you need þie your car?

1433
01:46:45,925 --> 01:46:47,211
Well living in Brooklyn.

1434
01:46:48,671 --> 01:46:50,790
- Then we see.
- I understood.

1435
01:46:53,012 --> 01:46:55,417
- We hear later.
- In later.

1436
01:46:57,506 --> 01:46:58,960
Let's go.

1437
01:47:38,896 --> 01:47:40,946
We back!
We back!

1438
01:47:40,947 --> 01:47:42,415
I did not.

1439
01:47:42,416 --> 01:47:43,377
Ends, B.I.G.

1440
01:47:45,632 --> 01:47:47,205
What are you, fetiþo?

1441
01:47:47,206 --> 01:47:49,724
- What are you doing?
- Good show!

1442
01:48:17,402 --> 01:48:18,856
What happened?
What happened?

1443
01:48:29,748 --> 01:48:31,972
Damn!
Take us to the hospital!

1444
01:48:41,678 --> 01:48:46,336
<i>Now  day was the end </ i></i>

1452
01:49:45,428 --> 01:49:46,480
Mrs. Wallace ...

1453
01:49:46,481 --> 01:49:49,637
if you need anything, I ...

1454
01:49:56,598 --> 01:49:59,988
I go to my son home
one last time.

1455
01:51:07,511 --> 01:51:08,615
Let me help you, Mrs. Wallace.

1456
01:51:08,616 --> 01:51:12,272
No, my dear, you just born.
Stay here and rest your back.

1457
01:51:12,273 --> 01:51:14,553
Now you can hold the arm nephew?

1458
01:51:14,554 --> 01:51:15,608
One minute, mother.

1459
01:51:19,349 --> 01:51:20,820
I thank you that you brought.

1460
01:51:20,821 --> 01:51:22,179
Your welcome.

1461
01:51:24,318 --> 01:51:26,777
"Ciorii" sweeps small
its kind of like you.

1462
01:51:26,778 --> 01:51:30,410
The bastard can not even pause to take
one week to be called "nigger"?

1463
01:51:30,411 --> 01:51:33,195
Like "bastard"
sounds better.

1464
01:51:34,922 --> 01:51:37,069
Boy, be careful how you talk
nepoþii beside mine!

1465
01:51:37,070 --> 01:51:38,126
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1466
01:51:42,750 --> 01:51:44,307
Tell your prayer.

1467
01:51:46,783 --> 01:51:47,771
Oh, my God,

1468
01:51:50,429 --> 01:51:52,097
thank you.

1469
01:51:56,667 --> 01:51:58,453
- What?
- Yes.

1470
01:52:00,742 --> 01:52:03,595
I thought it was perfect.

1471
01:52:29,529 --> 01:52:30,854
Living and Biggie TE!

1472
01:52:32,133 --> 01:52:33,910
We love you, Biggie!

1473
01:52:53,263 --> 01:52:56,872
My son, Christopher Wallace,
stories are told.

1474
01:52:56,873 --> 01:53:00,686
Some of them were funny,
others were sad.

1475
01:53:01,870 --> 01:53:03,624
Some were violent,

1476
01:53:03,625 --> 01:53:06,686
but people were listening to it.

1477
01:53:08,061 --> 01:53:12,575
I am sad that life he was persimmon
the age of 24 years.

1478
01:53:12,576 --> 01:53:18,091
But I find the thought of relieving
I became a man

1479
01:53:18,092 --> 01:53:21,641
and that he was ready to live.

1480
01:53:24,441 --> 01:53:27,526
When I looked out,
to all those faces,

1481
01:53:28,470 --> 01:53:29,937
something happened.

1482
01:53:30,710 --> 01:53:33,505
Someone from lot
started a radio

1483
01:53:35,074 --> 01:53:38,334
and I could hear my son's voice.
