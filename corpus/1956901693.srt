359
00:29:20,933 --> 00:29:23,457
The guy has just humiliated
a huge portion

360
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,459
of the most beautiful women
in Paris.

361
00:29:25,502 --> 00:29:27,678
The guy is a horror show.

362
00:29:27,722 --> 00:29:30,029
Don't be afraid?
Don't be ridiculous.

363
00:29:30,072 --> 00:29:31,726
Go on.

364
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,815
Shut up!
The guy's a monster.

365
00:29:33,859 --> 00:29:35,425
I'm a monster.

366
00:29:35,469 --> 00:29:37,558
You see?
Even he thinks so.

367
00:29:37,601 --> 00:29:40,300
Nothing moves me,
nothing touches me.

368
00:29:40,343 --> 00:29:42,084
They all look alike.

369
00:29:42,128 --> 00:29:45,000
plastic, forced,

370
00:29:45,044 --> 00:29:48,264
the image of Salvitore
must be life!

371
00:29:48,308 --> 00:29:51,833
You've got to get him
before he goes.

372
00:29:51,877 --> 00:29:55,837
- Information.
- No!

373
00:29:55,881 --> 00:29:59,188
Mimi: Veronique, come!

374
00:29:59,232 --> 00:30:02,017
Go on!
[ mouths words ]

375
00:30:02,061 --> 00:30:04,063
[ whispers ] No. No!

376
00:30:10,591 --> 00:30:12,985
I have lost my inspiration.

377
00:30:13,028 --> 00:30:15,552
I feel nothing.
I'm moved by nothing.

378
00:30:18,729 --> 00:30:20,819
That is my tragedy.

379
00:30:20,862 --> 00:30:23,691
If I could find something
beautiful that moved me,

380
00:30:23,734 --> 00:30:26,650
it would be a miracle,
I think.

381
00:30:36,922 --> 00:30:41,274
I want something more
than pretty.

382
00:30:41,317 --> 00:30:44,494
I want someone who's
full of life,

383
00:30:44,538 --> 00:30:47,541
full of joy,

384
00:30:47,584 --> 00:30:51,588
someone who's truthful
and challenging

385
00:30:51,632 --> 00:30:55,505
and not...

386
00:30:55,549 --> 00:30:57,029
this.

387
00:31:01,163 --> 00:31:04,340
I won't find it here.

388
00:31:04,384 --> 00:31:07,169
Mnh-mnh.

389
00:31:07,213 --> 00:31:09,389
Perhaps
I won't find it at all.

390
00:31:17,092 --> 00:31:18,920
- Did you do it?
- No.

391
00:31:18,964 --> 00:31:23,664
Do it right now.

392
00:31:23,707 --> 00:31:28,625
Señor Salvitore,
I'm Kelly Carter.

393
00:31:28,669 --> 00:31:30,366
I'm very happy for you.

394
00:31:36,285 --> 00:31:37,983
Great job.

395
00:31:42,161 --> 00:31:43,597
Veronique: You choked.

396
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,120
You're a girl.
He's a man.

397
00:31:45,164 --> 00:31:47,296
You had the
natural advantage.

398
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:49,298
You need to do something
to make yourself

399
00:31:49,342 --> 00:31:51,735
a little less invisible.

400
00:31:51,779 --> 00:31:54,608
I am going to help you
with this.

401
00:31:54,651 --> 00:31:57,698
- I don't need any help.
- I'll forget you said that.

402
00:31:57,741 --> 00:32:00,570
First thing's first...
looks count.

403
00:32:00,614 --> 00:32:02,094
You need a new one.

404
00:32:02,137 --> 00:32:04,705
You look like a housewife.
You're an artist.

405
00:32:04,748 --> 00:32:06,533
You got to make an effort

406
00:32:06,576 --> 00:32:08,404
to live up to
people's expectations.

407
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:10,754
I don't know,
you look normal.

408
00:32:29,556 --> 00:32:32,341
Rule two, you're exactly what
other people think you are.

409
00:32:32,385 --> 00:32:34,474
It's an existential thought,
I know.

410
00:32:34,517 --> 00:32:36,998
If you think you're ordinary,
you're ordinary.

411
00:32:37,042 --> 00:32:39,218
If you think you're special,
then you're special.

412
00:32:39,261 --> 00:32:44,310
We are going to rebuild
your self-confidence.

413
00:32:44,353 --> 00:32:46,355
Veronique: That doesn't look like tough.

414
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:50,011
That looks like you sat on something.

415
00:32:50,055 --> 00:32:51,839
Watch me.
Watch me.

416
00:32:55,669 --> 00:32:57,714
Try sultry again.

417
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:07,159
Now that looks like you have
something in your eye.

418
00:33:07,202 --> 00:33:08,943
I can't do this.
This is ridiculous.

419
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:10,814
- I can't do this.
- Of course, you can.

420
00:33:10,858 --> 00:33:12,642
- No, I can't!
I can't, okay?
- You can.

421
00:33:12,686 --> 00:33:14,166
The idea is just to get other people

422
00:33:14,209 --> 00:33:16,168
to see you in a certain way.

423
00:33:16,211 --> 00:33:19,823
It's no different than clothes.
It's a matter of confidence.

424
00:33:19,867 --> 00:33:22,696
Rule three...
it's all a game.

425
00:33:22,739 --> 00:33:24,089
I'll teach you a new one.

426
00:33:24,132 --> 00:33:26,134
This is...

427
00:33:26,178 --> 00:33:27,788
I've got no plan for this
evening

428
00:33:27,831 --> 00:33:30,617
so why don't you come over
and talk to me?

429
00:33:33,446 --> 00:33:35,404
- Are you serious?
- [ laughs ]

430
00:34:06,131 --> 00:34:08,350
Is there anyone
sitting here?

431
00:34:08,394 --> 00:34:11,223
- No.
- Thank you.

432
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:16,576
[ whispers ]
I don't know.

433
00:34:19,666 --> 00:34:21,102
Just leave me alone.

434
00:34:21,146 --> 00:34:23,191
Kelly, I thought you did
very well, honestly.

435
00:34:23,235 --> 00:34:25,541
- Come on!
- It was a stupid idea
in the first place.

436
00:34:25,585 --> 00:34:27,195
I can't believe
I went along with it.

437
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:29,241
The only way I can look
is the way I look.

438
00:34:29,284 --> 00:34:31,852
And I don't need men to make me
feel good about myself, okay?

439
00:34:31,895 --> 00:34:34,811
I feel fine about myself
as I am except for the fact

440
00:34:34,855 --> 00:34:36,683
that these pants are choking
the life out of me.

441
00:34:36,726 --> 00:34:38,815
[ voice breaking ]
I've never been happier.

442
00:34:41,905 --> 00:34:43,777
Nobody could be happy
like that.

00:34:47,259 --> 00:34:50,827
Mimi: Francesco.
Francesco?

444
00:34:53,395 --> 00:34:56,659
Francesco?

445
00:34:56,703 --> 00:34:58,400
Francesco?

446
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:03,971
- Mimi: Francesco.
- Rene: Francesco.

00:35:08,628 --> 00:35:11,152
I...

448
00:35:11,196 --> 00:35:14,155
I've lost
my inspiration.

449
00:35:14,199 --> 00:35:18,159
I can't find a new image
for the house of Salvitore.

450
00:35:18,203 --> 00:35:22,120
Everything
seems artificial.

451
00:35:22,163 --> 00:35:24,644
I'm a fraud.

452
00:35:24,687 --> 00:35:28,778
And I've let you down.
I'm sorry.

[ clicks tongue ]

454
00:35:34,610 --> 00:35:37,135
We should close the house
of Salvitore.

455
00:35:39,833 --> 00:35:42,183
It is nothing
but a house of cards.

456
00:35:44,707 --> 00:35:46,927
Only a miracle
can save me now.

when do you open?

- What?
- This is Versailles,
isn't it?

- Go away.
- I'm here, aren't I?

Your map is upside down.

Wow.

This is some kind of a house.

Ohh!

00:36:44,854 --> 00:36:47,335
You could throw a big,

Oh, you know,

when you're looking
for something,

476
00:37:01,262 --> 00:37:03,743
it can be staring you
in the face,

477
00:37:03,786 --> 00:37:08,574
and you sometimes have to find
different ways of seeing it.

478
00:37:08,617 --> 00:37:12,621
Thank you for your advice.

I have an idea.

00:37:31,161 --> 00:37:33,425
Sometimes it can be
right in your face.

485
00:37:33,468 --> 00:37:36,732
And you need to see a different
way of looking at it, you see.

486
00:37:36,776 --> 00:37:38,473
Because it's a party,

they're being watched.

Uh, yes.

713
00:56:37,698 --> 00:56:40,701
Do you like them?

714
00:56:40,745 --> 00:56:43,965
I must find her.
Do you understand?

715
00:56:44,009 --> 00:56:47,578
Yeah,
more than you know.

716
00:56:47,621 --> 00:56:50,537
Domino: Did you see
the way he looked at me?

717
00:56:50,581 --> 00:56:52,974
I think he really liked me.

718
00:56:53,018 --> 00:56:54,411
[ giggles ]

719
00:56:56,282 --> 00:56:59,459
I do.

720
00:56:59,503 --> 00:57:01,983
Unbelievable.

721
00:57:11,689 --> 00:57:13,952
Kelly, Kelly the new image
of Salvitore.

722
00:57:13,995 --> 00:57:15,649
- You're gonna be rich
and famous.
- Shh.

723
00:57:15,693 --> 00:57:17,912
Oh, oh...

724
00:57:17,956 --> 00:57:21,046
oh, my God,
what happened?

725
00:57:21,089 --> 00:57:23,918
Oh, I get it.
It was a joke, right.

726
00:57:23,962 --> 00:57:26,355
No, it wasn't a joke, okay?

727
00:57:26,399 --> 00:57:29,446
How did you do it?

728
00:57:29,489 --> 00:57:31,491
You know, I don't know.

729
00:57:31,535 --> 00:57:35,016
And what's worse is
I don't know how I undid it.

730
00:57:35,060 --> 00:57:39,499
Well, whatever you did,
you'd better do it again.

731
00:57:39,543 --> 00:57:43,677
- Maybe it was a dream.
- It wasn't a dream.

732
00:57:43,721 --> 00:57:46,419
Do you realize what's
riding on this?

733
00:57:46,463 --> 00:57:49,291
Do you realize how
much money's at stake?

734
00:57:49,335 --> 00:57:52,164
- I don't care about the money.
- You don't care about
the...

735
00:57:52,207 --> 00:57:55,036
You don't care about the money?
Are you crazy?

736
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:57,169
You will be world-famous.

737
00:57:57,212 --> 00:58:00,389
- I don't think you understand.
- I don't think you understand.

738
00:58:00,433 --> 00:58:03,523
All I want to do
is design shoes.

739
00:58:03,567 --> 00:58:06,047
When you look like
you looked last night,

740
00:58:06,091 --> 00:58:07,788
you can do and be
anything you want,

741
00:58:07,832 --> 00:58:09,964
even design shoes.

742
00:58:10,008 --> 00:58:11,618
Do you really think so?

743
00:58:11,662 --> 00:58:14,229
I know. Believe me.

744
00:58:14,273 --> 00:58:16,580
If he can have who
you were last night,

745
00:58:16,623 --> 00:58:20,627
he will do anything
for who you are today.

746
00:58:20,671 --> 00:58:24,152
Do you know where
you lost it?

747
00:58:24,196 --> 00:58:26,285
Where I lost what?

748
00:58:26,328 --> 00:58:29,767
Your looks.

749
00:58:29,810 --> 00:58:33,771
When I lose something,
I try to retrace my steps.

750
00:58:33,814 --> 00:58:36,904
Kelly, I'm gonna
help you with this.

751
00:58:40,821 --> 00:58:42,823
You know, I'd done my hair,
I'd done my makeup,

752
00:58:42,867 --> 00:58:44,564
I put on my dress,

753
00:58:44,608 --> 00:58:47,698
I remember looking in
the mirror, and I was still me.

754
00:58:47,741 --> 00:58:50,570
There's got to be
something else.

755
00:58:50,614 --> 00:58:54,531
Yeah, I guess I'm
just destined to be me.

756
00:58:54,574 --> 00:58:57,751
That's okay, it's not so bad.
I've been me all my life.

757
00:58:57,795 --> 00:59:00,101
And I'm used to it.

758
00:59:00,145 --> 00:59:01,625
Want something to drink?

759
00:59:09,633 --> 00:59:11,286
Sorry.

760
00:59:13,767 --> 00:59:14,855
What is it?

761
00:59:18,642 --> 00:59:21,819
What?

762
00:59:21,862 --> 00:59:24,082
It...

763
00:59:24,125 --> 00:59:28,434
It worked.

764
00:59:28,477 --> 00:59:31,655
- Oh, my.
- What did you do?

765
00:59:31,698 --> 00:59:33,482
I opened the refrigerator.

766
00:59:33,526 --> 00:59:36,181
Opening the refrigerator,
usually makes you ugly.

767
00:59:36,224 --> 00:59:38,618
Close it.

768
00:59:38,662 --> 00:59:39,967
Look at me.

769
00:59:41,969 --> 00:59:43,580
It's not the refrigerator.

770
00:59:43,623 --> 00:59:45,320
What else?

771
00:59:45,364 --> 00:59:49,281
Um, I was sitting
over there, right?

772
00:59:49,324 --> 00:59:51,762
Okay, I'm over here.

773
00:59:51,805 --> 00:59:54,634
I was sitting down,
I get up, I walk over here.

774
00:59:54,678 --> 00:59:57,028
Look at me.
No.

775
00:59:57,071 --> 00:59:59,639
Um, oh, I remember.

776
00:59:59,683 --> 01:00:01,598
I put my shoe on.

777
01:00:07,516 --> 01:00:09,649
Sit down, sit down.

778
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:15,176
Put it on.

Yes. Yes.
Yes, yes, yes.

784
01:00:40,549 --> 01:00:42,334
- [ knock on door ]
- Yes?

785
01:00:45,946 --> 01:00:47,774
It's you.

786
01:00:47,818 --> 01:00:50,690
Thank God,
I thought I'd lost you.

787
01:00:50,734 --> 01:00:52,779
I am already at work
on my new collection...

788
01:00:52,823 --> 01:00:54,128
Prudence by Salvitore.

789
01:00:54,172 --> 01:00:55,695
I am covering parts
of the body

790
01:00:55,739 --> 01:00:58,611
that haven't been covered
in years.

791
01:00:58,655 --> 01:01:03,355
I am alive again.
I'm touched by genius.

792
01:01:03,398 --> 01:01:05,792
We need to talk business.

793
01:01:07,664 --> 01:01:09,796
Okay, the money's
not the problem.

794
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:13,234
There are a couple of things
we want you to look after...

795
01:01:13,278 --> 01:01:16,150
namely, Prudence wants
her own dresser

796
01:01:16,194 --> 01:01:18,675
and her personal assistant.

797
01:01:18,718 --> 01:01:19,850
Fine.

798
01:01:19,893 --> 01:01:21,242
Who do you want?

799
01:01:21,286 --> 01:01:23,070
Veronique.

800
01:01:23,114 --> 01:01:25,464
We can negotiate my fee,
signing bonus,

801
01:01:25,507 --> 01:01:27,335
- and holiday pay later.
- Mm-hmm.

802
01:01:27,379 --> 01:01:29,337
Oh, and there's
one more thing.

803
01:01:29,381 --> 01:01:32,689
There is one more thing.

804
01:01:32,732 --> 01:01:36,562
- I want my own designer
for my shoes.
- Rene: Who?

805
01:01:36,605 --> 01:01:39,043
- Kelly Carter.
- All: Who?

806
01:01:39,086 --> 01:01:41,523
She's not a designer.

807
01:01:41,567 --> 01:01:42,742
[ whispers ] She's not a designer.

808
01:01:42,786 --> 01:01:44,396
She is too.

809
01:01:44,439 --> 01:01:46,137
She's a great graduate
of the Paris institute.

810
01:01:46,180 --> 01:01:48,792
A piece of paper doesn't
make you a designer.

811
01:01:48,835 --> 01:01:51,403
She has no reputation.
It's not possible.

812
01:01:51,446 --> 01:01:53,840
It's not going to be possible.

813
01:01:56,408 --> 01:01:58,192
Have you seen her work?

814
01:01:58,236 --> 01:02:01,935
We can't let an amateur
work with a master.

815
01:02:01,979 --> 01:02:04,459
Rene: It wouldn't be good
for either of them.

816
01:02:04,503 --> 01:02:08,202
I'm afraid we can't
say yes to this.

817
01:02:08,246 --> 01:02:10,422
They can't say yes to this.

818
01:02:10,465 --> 01:02:12,119
We'll pass on this one
if we can put aside

819
01:02:12,163 --> 01:02:14,600
a little extra money
for the dresser.

820
01:02:14,643 --> 01:02:16,776
Where...
where are you going?

821
01:02:16,820 --> 01:02:18,604
Home.

822
01:02:18,647 --> 01:02:20,867
- We are not done.
- Oh, yes, we are.

823
01:02:20,911 --> 01:02:23,000
Thank you very much
for your offer,

824
01:02:23,043 --> 01:02:24,915
but I'm not interested.

825
01:02:24,958 --> 01:02:26,786
Prudence, Prudence...

826
01:02:26,830 --> 01:02:30,747
I want to make this work.

827
01:02:30,790 --> 01:02:33,401
Now if your friend is good,
she can design your shoes.

828
01:02:33,445 --> 01:02:36,970
but if she's bad,
this I can offer.

829
01:02:37,014 --> 01:02:40,191
This I can accept.

830
01:02:40,234 --> 01:02:43,455
- Sleep with me tonight.
- This I can't.

831
01:02:51,811 --> 01:02:53,770
Carter!

832
01:03:03,954 --> 01:03:05,869
Kelly Carter.

833
01:03:10,482 --> 01:03:13,267
Look at her.
She's so ordinary.

834
01:03:13,311 --> 01:03:14,791
Hi.

835
01:03:17,141 --> 01:03:20,448
Look, I feel so stupid
just standing here.

836
01:03:20,492 --> 01:03:22,015
Hi, I'm Kelly Carter.

837
01:03:22,059 --> 01:03:24,104
I'm thrilled to have
a chance to work with you.

838
01:03:27,281 --> 01:03:29,849
So what are you working on?

839
01:03:29,893 --> 01:03:32,504
You were a dresser, I believe,
in my last collection.

840
01:03:32,547 --> 01:03:34,114
That's right.

841
01:03:34,158 --> 01:03:35,681
I'm sorry it wasn't
more successful.

842
01:03:37,901 --> 01:03:39,511
I'll try to do better this time.

843
01:03:44,690 --> 01:03:46,300
I'm working on a coat.

844
01:03:46,344 --> 01:03:48,520
Mm.

845
01:03:48,563 --> 01:03:52,306
You know, I...
I like the idea.

846
01:03:52,350 --> 01:03:54,352
It's similar to what
you did last year,

847
01:03:54,395 --> 01:03:57,050
but better.

848
01:03:57,094 --> 01:03:58,530
I love the idea
of a coatdress,

849
01:03:58,573 --> 01:04:00,053
but, may I?

850
01:04:00,097 --> 01:04:02,316
Um...

851
01:04:02,360 --> 01:04:05,493
If you had
a great winter shoe.

852
01:04:05,537 --> 01:04:08,540
It would really finish the look, Something like this.

853
01:04:08,583 --> 01:04:13,371
I think it would work.
What do you think?

854
01:04:13,414 --> 01:04:15,764
[ indistinct whispering ]

855
01:04:15,808 --> 01:04:18,550
How can I concentrate
with everyone in the room?

856
01:04:18,593 --> 01:04:21,596
Get out, all of you!

857
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:22,902
Jesus.

858
01:04:26,427 --> 01:04:28,038
Carter.

859
01:04:28,081 --> 01:04:30,083
Mimi, close the door.

860
01:04:32,216 --> 01:04:34,783
Come here.
Show me.

861
01:04:38,091 --> 01:04:39,788
Well, this one...

862
01:04:39,832 --> 01:04:42,269
- I don't need any explanations.
Thank you.
- Okay.

863
01:04:42,313 --> 01:04:44,576
Can I ask you something?

How good of friends
are you with Prudence?

865
01:04:48,232 --> 01:04:51,539
Quite good. You could say
we're like sisters.

01:04:51,583 --> 01:04:53,933
Did she...

867
01:04:53,977 --> 01:04:56,893
does she...

You are very good.

869
01:04:59,199 --> 01:05:01,114
Did she mention me at all?

If it's bad.
Don't tell me.

871
01:05:03,073 --> 01:05:05,205
Well, of course,
she mentioned you.

872
01:05:07,555 --> 01:05:09,862
Very nice choice of color.

01:05:09,906 --> 01:05:12,952
Were they good mentions
or bad mentions?

You're very good
with the fabrics.

If it's bad,
don't tell me.

876

on the whole, good.

Good.

01:05:24,355 --> 01:05:26,096
If you talk to Prudence again,

880
01:05:26,139 --> 01:05:29,838
you can tell her that I think
she is very attractive.

881
01:05:29,882 --> 01:05:31,797
I think she got that.

882
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:35,496
And that I would like
to get to know her better.

883
01:05:35,540 --> 01:05:37,020
Really?

884
01:05:42,025 --> 01:05:44,984
I'm not happy with that color.
What do you think?

885

I think you're right
not to be happy.

01:19:30,330 --> 01:19:32,506
- I don't...
- Francesco.

1068
01:19:32,550 --> 01:19:35,248
- I would like you to watch.
- I was.

1069
01:19:39,296 --> 01:19:40,732
Where were you?

1070
01:19:40,776 --> 01:19:42,603
I was just getting
the next setup ready.

1071
01:19:45,041 --> 01:19:47,870
What do you think
about the clothes?

1072
01:19:47,913 --> 01:19:49,828
Truthfully.

1073
01:19:49,872 --> 01:19:52,004
I think they're wonderful.

1074
01:19:52,048 --> 01:19:53,658
You do?

1075
01:19:53,701 --> 01:19:55,747
Mm-mm, I do.

1076
01:19:55,791 --> 01:19:57,836
Thank you.

1077
01:19:57,880 --> 01:19:59,969
Prudence!

1078
01:20:13,417 --> 01:20:15,767
[ laughing ]

1079
01:20:25,255 --> 01:20:27,387
Cut it!

1080
01:20:34,264 --> 01:20:36,222
Um, she's resting okay?

1081
01:20:36,266 --> 01:20:38,703
And you should just give her...
give her a few minutes.

1082
01:20:38,746 --> 01:20:40,574
- Can you just give her
a few minutes?
- What?

1083
01:20:40,618 --> 01:20:42,228
- Let her rest, okay?
- Okay, alright.

1084
01:20:42,272 --> 01:20:44,491
- Just give me a minute,
all right?
- One minute. Go.

1085
01:20:56,155 --> 01:20:58,636
- [ knock on door ]
- Francesco: Hello?

1086
01:21:07,906 --> 01:21:10,300
- Where's Kelly?
- She just disappeared
for a second.

1087
01:21:13,781 --> 01:21:15,435
Shh.

1088
01:21:15,479 --> 01:21:17,437
[ mouths words ]

1089
01:21:23,704 --> 01:21:25,141
[ laughs ]

1090
01:21:30,624 --> 01:21:32,626
- Snow!
- Yeah!

1091
01:21:32,670 --> 01:21:33,976
Snow!

1092
01:21:34,019 --> 01:21:37,762
- So?
- No snow, you know?

1093
01:21:37,805 --> 01:21:39,372
No snow!

1094
01:21:41,853 --> 01:21:43,899
- How is she?
- She'll be ready in a second.

1095
01:21:43,942 --> 01:21:46,249
Good, I want to see
her fully dressed before we go.

1096
01:21:46,292 --> 01:21:49,556
- Of course.
- I haven't seen the shoes.

1097
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:51,776
- The... the shoes?
- Yes, the shoes.

1098
01:21:51,819 --> 01:21:53,952
The shoes that Kelly designed
to go with the coat.

1099
01:21:53,996 --> 01:21:55,475
I haven't seen
Prudence in them.

1100
01:21:55,519 --> 01:21:58,043
I want to see that
before we go.

1101
01:21:58,087 --> 01:21:59,523
Yeah.

1102
01:22:02,395 --> 01:22:04,745
We've got a huge problem.

1103
01:22:04,789 --> 01:22:08,880
What kind of shoes did Prudence
intend to wear with this outfit?

1104
01:22:08,924 --> 01:22:10,708
Oh, my God.

1105
01:22:10,751 --> 01:22:14,059
One of you two has got to go.
And I say we get rid of Kelly.

1106
01:22:14,103 --> 01:22:15,626
What?

1107
01:22:15,669 --> 01:22:18,585
Prudence earns more money.
Salvitore loves her.

1108
01:22:18,629 --> 01:22:20,239
She gets noticed everywhere
she goes.

1109
01:22:20,283 --> 01:22:22,676
- She could be important
to our careers.
- Our careers?

1110
01:22:22,720 --> 01:22:24,635
I think it is important
we are realistic

1111
01:22:24,678 --> 01:22:26,115
about this decision.

1112
01:22:26,158 --> 01:22:27,855
I can't believe
you're saying this.

1113
01:22:27,899 --> 01:22:29,118
Francesco: Prudence?

1114
01:22:29,161 --> 01:22:31,120
What I suggest is that
you go out there

1115
01:22:31,163 --> 01:22:33,252
in your evening shoes
and tell Francesco

1116
01:22:33,296 --> 01:22:35,385
that the shoes
are a real disaster

1117
01:22:35,428 --> 01:22:36,864
and that you
have fired Kelly.

1118
01:22:36,908 --> 01:22:38,301
Forget it!

1119
01:22:38,344 --> 01:22:40,564
You want Salvitore,
you get him as Prudence.

1120
01:22:40,607 --> 01:22:43,654
You want a big career,
you get it as Prudence.

1121
01:22:43,697 --> 01:22:45,090
What does Kelly
have to offer?

1122
01:22:45,134 --> 01:22:47,179
Francesco: Prudence!

1123
01:22:47,223 --> 01:22:49,747
- A lot.
- Mimi: We're waiting.

1124
01:22:49,790 --> 01:22:52,924
Okay, let's let him decide.

1125
01:22:52,968 --> 01:22:55,187
Oh... [ scoffs ]
oh, please.

1126
01:22:55,231 --> 01:22:57,711
Men always make
the wrong decision.

1127
01:23:00,062 --> 01:23:02,325
She what?

1128
01:23:02,368 --> 01:23:05,719
She won't wear the shoes.
She refuses.

1129
01:23:05,763 --> 01:23:08,026
You're gonna have to decide.

1130
01:23:08,070 --> 01:23:09,810
Either Prudence goes or I go.

1131
01:23:09,854 --> 01:23:12,030
- You can't have us both.
- Why not?

1132
01:23:12,074 --> 01:23:16,034
Listen to me.
Either she goes or I go.

1133
01:23:16,078 --> 01:23:21,866
It is very, very expensive
to arrange all this.

1134
01:23:21,909 --> 01:23:25,261
I'm sorry to do this to you,
but you have to decide.

1135
01:23:25,304 --> 01:23:27,045
- I have to make a choice?
- Yes.

1136
01:23:27,089 --> 01:23:29,352
- Now?
- Yes.

1137
01:23:29,395 --> 01:23:31,658
Good decision.

1138
01:23:37,751 --> 01:23:40,972
Can I have a word with you
over here for a minute?

1139
01:23:44,367 --> 01:23:47,152
What is this shit, huh?

1140
01:23:47,196 --> 01:23:49,154
I work with you.

1141
01:23:49,198 --> 01:23:50,634
I give you support,
encouragement.

1142
01:23:50,677 --> 01:23:52,070
I hold your hand,

1143
01:23:52,114 --> 01:23:54,768
and now you're telling me
to move on?

1144
01:23:54,812 --> 01:23:56,553
I've never lied to you,
Francesco.

1145
01:23:56,596 --> 01:23:58,729
But you're due for a few
home truths.

1146
01:23:58,772 --> 01:24:02,080
I care about you, I really do,
but you don't care about me

1147
01:24:02,124 --> 01:24:04,039
because you don't care
about people.

1148
01:24:04,082 --> 01:24:06,650
All you care about
are appearances,

1149
01:24:06,693 --> 01:24:07,999
looks, surface.

1150
01:24:08,043 --> 01:24:10,088
All this, your whole world
is images.

1151
01:24:10,132 --> 01:24:13,091
You're surrounded by people
who lie to you,

1152
01:24:13,135 --> 01:24:15,050
who believe the same shit
that you do,

1153
01:24:15,093 --> 01:24:16,573
but I know you know
the difference,

1154
01:24:16,616 --> 01:24:18,096
and I know you have a heart.

1155
01:24:18,140 --> 01:24:19,619
But you're just too afraid
to use it.

1156
01:24:19,663 --> 01:24:21,099
And that's what makes
you a fraud,

1157
01:24:21,143 --> 01:24:22,796
not as a designer
but as a human being.

1158
01:24:22,840 --> 01:24:24,450
Do you understand?

1159
01:24:24,494 --> 01:24:25,843
Adios.

1160
01:24:28,106 --> 01:24:30,239
- Give me the shoes.
- I don't...

1161
01:24:30,282 --> 01:24:31,718
Don't say a word.

1162
01:24:35,418 --> 01:24:37,985
- Where's Kelly?
- Where's Carter?

1163
01:24:38,029 --> 01:24:39,726
She's gone, real upset.

1164
01:24:39,770 --> 01:24:42,294
Don't worry, I'll make sure
everything is okay.

1165
01:24:42,338 --> 01:24:45,471
- She's gone?
- Yeah.

1166
01:24:45,515 --> 01:24:48,648
- Good, she was a waste of time.
- She's gone.

1167
01:24:48,692 --> 01:24:50,824
Oh, good lord,
please take those shoes off.

1168
01:24:50,868 --> 01:24:53,131
No.

1169
01:24:53,175 --> 01:24:54,872
I can't wear these.
They're horrible.

1170
01:25:00,312 --> 01:25:03,185
I want you
to wear those shoes.

1171
01:25:03,228 --> 01:25:06,797
They're a disaster.
I won't wear them.

1172
01:25:06,840 --> 01:25:11,280
- You won't wear them?
- No.

1173
01:25:11,323 --> 01:25:13,847
- You won't wear them?
- No.

1174
01:25:13,891 --> 01:25:16,067
Prudence is right.
Carter's an amateur.

1175
01:25:16,111 --> 01:25:17,982
Designers like her
are two a penny.

1176
01:25:18,025 --> 01:25:19,636
Another opinion from you

1177
01:25:19,679 --> 01:25:21,681
and you'll be selling rags
in the flea markets.

1178
01:25:26,338 --> 01:25:29,080
These shoes are
a reflection of effort,

1179
01:25:29,124 --> 01:25:32,127
of style
and of substance.

1180
01:25:32,170 --> 01:25:34,955
She's a fine designer
and an inspiration to me.

1181
01:25:34,999 --> 01:25:37,871
You're lucky
to have met her.

1182
01:25:37,915 --> 01:25:40,396
Prudence, there's a very
important rule

1183
01:25:40,439 --> 01:25:41,962
you may have forgotten.

1184
01:25:42,006 --> 01:25:44,226
Looks fade.

1185
01:25:44,269 --> 01:25:46,141
And yours have faded
like a bad sunset.

1186
01:25:52,059 --> 01:25:55,672
- Oh, thank you.
- Yes.

1187
01:25:55,715 --> 01:25:59,328
Where can I find Kelly?

1188
01:25:59,371 --> 01:26:00,938
[ mouths words ]

1189
01:26:00,981 --> 01:26:02,809
Down by the river.

1190
01:26:02,853 --> 01:26:05,072
There is a little place
she goes,

1191
01:26:05,116 --> 01:26:06,683
down by the river.

1192
01:26:22,089 --> 01:26:23,526
Salvitore: Kelly!

1193
01:26:29,227 --> 01:26:30,576
Kelly!

1194
01:26:33,057 --> 01:26:36,016
Excuse me.

1195
01:26:36,060 --> 01:26:38,105
I'm leaving now.

1196
01:26:38,149 --> 01:26:40,934
And I just wanted to thank you
for all your help.

1197
01:26:40,978 --> 01:26:44,242
You've been ever so kind.
Stay that way.

1198
01:26:44,286 --> 01:26:46,549
Kelly!

1199
01:26:46,592 --> 01:26:48,246
Kelly!

1200
01:26:56,689 --> 01:26:58,996
How do I get from here
to Budapest?

1201
01:27:08,092 --> 01:27:12,096
Come back.
Work for me.

1202
01:27:12,139 --> 01:27:13,750
Why should I?

1203
01:27:18,102 --> 01:27:19,712
Because I need you.

1204
01:27:21,627 --> 01:27:24,108
You're very talented.

1205
01:27:24,151 --> 01:27:25,718
You've helped me.

1206
01:27:29,200 --> 01:27:31,158
I care about you.

1207
01:27:37,077 --> 01:27:39,036
I don't want to lose you.

1208
01:27:46,478 --> 01:27:48,175
There's something about you...

1209
01:27:51,048 --> 01:27:53,268
that's magical.

1210
01:27:59,752 --> 01:28:01,711
You say all the right things.
