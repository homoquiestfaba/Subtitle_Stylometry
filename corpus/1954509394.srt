1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:04,459
Brand X.

2
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:51,760
Okay! Okay.

3
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:55,600
Good Morning

4
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:01,160
I'm Agent Peterson. And this is Agent Wallace

5
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:10,620
Yeah. He's new. But, he's learning, so cut him a little slack for now.

6
00:01:13,659 --> 00:01:15,439
Tell me your name.

7
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,960
...your real name, for the record.

8
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:25,579
Charles Drake.

9
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:31,660
What... what do you want from me?

10
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:34,200
What do we want? What do we want!?

11
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,780
You the motherfucker who likes to steal shit from the government! Huh? Huh!?

12
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:50,100
Not yet. Be Patient

13
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,440
See what I mean?

14
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:02,340
What do you do for a living, Charles?

15
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:08,719
I teach math, at Berkley.

16
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,920
Nice cover, asshole.

17
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:19,080
ALGORITHM: noun. a set of rules to be followed in problem-solving operations, especially by a computer.

18
00:02:34,539 --> 00:02:36,599
A month ago I was a god.

19
00:02:38,139 --> 00:02:40,719
Most people have no idea what a hacker can do.

20
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,319
I make the world you live in...

21
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:48,759
...and I can reshape that world if I feel like it.

22
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:11,180
When I look around I don't see borders walls or locks.

23
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:13,599
I see puzzles...

24
00:03:13,699 --> 00:03:17,079
...games that entertain me while I do bigger things.

25
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:43,060
Things like breaking into the phone company to rewrite the code on their servers…

26
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:45,599
...and give myself free unlimited service.

27
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:54,659
Swapping out my pre-burned SIM cards everyday at 6pm is a small price to pay.

28
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:20,400
I don't care about privacy.

29
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:24,120
or social status or accumulating stuff.

30
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:27,300
I don't care about the law or who makes it.

31
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:31,520
I live by one rule: information should be free.

32
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:38,819
And everything can be simplified, encoded and understood as information.

33
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:43,199
We call this the information age for a reason.

34
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:49,819
Companies and governments don't get it, so they are powerless against me.

35
00:05:49,819 --> 00:05:51,500
You think there are rules?

36
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,839
You treat computers like you do everything else...

37
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:57,219
...like it's an immutable fact of life and because of that…

38
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:59,940
...your worldview is antiquated.

39
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:02,220
Get ready for a serious paradigm shift.

40
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:07,200
The geeks have inherited the earth... the rest of you just don't know it yet.

41
00:06:08,579 --> 00:06:10,839
For your consideration, exhibit A.

42
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:14,939
I just hacked every computer within 20 feet of me.

43
00:06:15,379 --> 00:06:17,500
I own them now.

44
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,120
Thanks for coming.

45
00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:41,779
I think my wife is cheating on me.

46
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,939
So ditch her.

47
00:06:46,699 --> 00:06:50,599
California's a No Fault state. She gets half regardless.

48
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:54,220
I want proof.

49
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:01,139
What for? Just call it "irreconcilable differences" and bail.

50
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:05,379
I want proof for myself.

51
00:07:08,459 --> 00:07:11,099
I need to know.

52
00:07:16,899 --> 00:07:18,959
What kind of proof?

53
00:07:21,259 --> 00:07:27,959
You want video of her playing another guy's skin-flute?

54
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:29,959
'cause that's not what I do.

55
00:07:30,019 --> 00:07:31,599
No, no, no, no, no. Look around.

56
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,120
If you find anything you send it to me.

57
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:36,500
Either way you still get paid.

58
00:07:37,779 --> 00:07:42,159
That's the deal. You know my fee.

59
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:48,360
Why would I hack all these computers...

60
00:07:48,379 --> 00:07:51,500
...including the laptop of a man who just gave me five grand?

61
00:07:52,379 --> 00:07:54,339
I don't care what he does for a living.

62
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,680
And if your wife finds out...?

63
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,420
She won't.

64
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:06,699
I understand the need for discretion, Mr...?

65
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,920
It's LU$er

66
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:19,020
I collect computers. Most of them don't lead anywhere interesting

67
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,579
so I just add them to my botnet

68
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,960
a massive set of computers I use to do whatever I feel like doing at the time

69
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:31,779
mostly, to cover any trace of the big hacks that I do that might lead back to me.

70
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,519
I can write the code I need to break into Dempsey's network.

71
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:42,379
But he lives in a very expensive neighborhood.

72
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:47,520
I can't just sit on his curb, outside his house, brute-forcing my way in.

73
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:45,100
I need another Can-of-Worm.

74
00:09:46,779 --> 00:09:47,980
How soon do you need it?

75
00:09:48,059 --> 00:09:49,099
Two days?

76
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,019
Are you coming?

77
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:58,259
Hackers come in two basic models: coders and makers.

78
00:09:58,759 --> 00:10:00,500
Bitchan is a maker.

79
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,440
She has a degree in electrical engineering.

80
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:10,779
In other words, she's a lightning god, controlling and manipulating electricity to do her will.

81
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:14,720
As a side job, she modified gaming consoles...

82
00:10:14,779 --> 00:10:18,299
...so they'll played copied discs or games from anywhere in the world.

83
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:21,039
It's not to break the law.

84
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,440
That isn't even a factor.

85
00:10:24,539 --> 00:10:28,019
She does it for the same reason I do. It's about information.

86
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:31,519
And region encoding is just another puzzle blocking the way.

87
00:10:42,759 --> 00:10:45,899
So, is this the gig Decimate hooked you up with?

88
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:51,659
Yeah. It's residential. He lives in St. Francis Wood.

89
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:57,100
So, do the TV, the Wi-Fi, and anything else you can think of.

90
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,680
What about the firewall?

91
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:05,939
That too. They just upgraded to smart-meters.

92
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:12,060
If the worm doesn't get through in five hours

93
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:16,460
just reset the power to the house... force a reboot.

94
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:19,600
And when the can works?

95
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:26,939
How big?

96
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:27,899
It'll fit.

97
00:11:35,379 --> 00:11:37,139
Can I spend the night?

98
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,379
When did you start asking?

99
00:11:41,379 --> 00:11:43,419
I'm going to be here until morning.

100
00:12:11,559 --> 00:12:13,659
We're not ADHD.

101
00:12:14,139 --> 00:12:19,080
We just don't care that wind-speeds on Saturn can get up to 3,000 miles per hour.

102
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,800
I remember it because I collect information.

103
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:26,219
But it's worthless to me until I decide to build a probe to land on Saturn,

104
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,640
which doesn't even have a surface to land on anyway.

105
00:13:20,139 --> 00:13:24,480
It's 5:55pm and Bitchan sent me a text letting me know

106
00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:29,659
that the Can-of-Worm will run for 4 days passive, or 12 hours at full-power.

107
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,320
We like things that make us think.

108
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,460
Like, what's the most efficient way to run a Linux computer off of a battery?

109
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:48,200
How fast can I get this program to run?

110
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:52,180
What's the best way to break into a network?

111
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:18,139
What's the best time to launch an attack against a home network?

112
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:40,579
Between the hours of 3:00am and 5:00am everyone's asleep.

113
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:44,240
Even the police who normally patrol are sitting in their cars

114
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:48,240
in secluded parking lots, filling out drunk-driver arrest reports.

115
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:36,080
The first and probably easiest way into any home network is the TV.

116
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:40,480
All new TVs come with Internet-capable software

117
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,940
usually Wi-Fi enabled by default.

118
00:15:43,659 --> 00:15:48,079
Most people don't keep their TV software updated with the latest security patches.

119
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,720
Of course, that doesn't always work.

120
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,900
There are two easy hacks to get past most firewalls.

121
00:15:55,379 --> 00:15:59,919
The first is to use a vulnerability in the default security setup

122
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:04,139
in almost all routers built between 2009 and 2012.

123
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:08,179
The other is to turn the power off and back on.

124
00:16:08,899 --> 00:16:13,000
For 60 seconds, while the hardware reboots, the entire home network

125
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,539
is completely insecure because the firewall software loads last.

126
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,019
The point isn't the method. It's the potential.

127
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,860
There's always a way in.

128
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,420
It might be a bit of a moral grey area to use one of the few

129
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:09,039
socially promoted bastions of free information to hack.

130
00:17:09,619 --> 00:17:13,319
Or, it might be perfectly inline with the ideas of the librarians.

131
00:17:14,019 --> 00:17:16,960
Who knows? I don't ask.

132
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:20,699
The point is, I'm not doing this from home.

133
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:51,599
I'm not destroying Mrs. Dempsey; she did that on her own.

134
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:56,120
I'm just exploiting the vulnerability her carnal excesses created.

135
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:40,220
Do you know where the weakest link in any security system is?

136
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:43,240
It's you, with your shitty passwords

137
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:46,859
and how you share every part of your life online

138
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:52,060
from geotagging everything you do, to a photo you post of your new ATM card.

139
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:08,200
And your willingness to click on links that promise something you want.

140
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:22,180
And now I own Sam Novak's computer.

141
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,980
Whoever he is.

142
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:45,059
Arthur C. Clarke wrote that any sufficiently advanced technology

143
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:47,500
is indistinguishable from magic.

144
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:49,819
This is where we make the magic.

145
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:54,300
Anyone heard of Emergent See?

146
00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:00,700
Emergent See.... Big. Ugly. Nasty government contractor

147
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:07,279
Data-mining. NSA. CIA. Hardcore combinatorial math.

148
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,759
Is that it? Just data-mining?

149
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,120
What's your interest in Emergent See?

150
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:18,599
Oh. Just a side project I'm working on.

151
00:20:26,019 --> 00:20:28,119
Tell me that you're using the neighbor's Wi-Fi.

152
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:29,299
Uh, yeah.

153
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:38,960
I need a drink.

154
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,640
Anybody else?

155
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:54,440
So, what's the uh... great LU$er up to tonight?

156
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,840
Finished with that client Decimate sets you up with?

157
00:20:58,079 --> 00:21:01,179
This afternoon. How did you know about that?

158
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:03,180
Bitchan told me.

159
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,580
She a cheating slut?

160
00:21:05,579 --> 00:21:07,579
Yeah. Something like that.

161
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:13,279
But, you'll never guess with who.

162
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:15,119
Does it matter?

163
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:16,920
Sam Novak.

164
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,539
Don't know him.

165
00:21:18,539 --> 00:21:20,859
CTO of Emergent See.

166
00:21:21,579 --> 00:21:23,539
No shit!?

167
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:31,180
I rooted his office computer this afternoon. I'm searching their network right now, as we speak.

168
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:31,920
Oh, no. Will, no, no.

169
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:32,640
I told you I wasn't.

170
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,520
It's too heavy for Backdoor.

171
00:21:33,519 --> 00:21:34,920
I'm not using your network.

172
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:37,300
Yeah. And Hash told you what Emergent See does.

173
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,779
Large-scale data-mining. That means NSA. They'll find the intrusion.

174
00:21:40,859 --> 00:21:46,959
If anyone sees anything, they're just going to think that Novak has his own botnet.

175
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:53,540
Fine. I think you can do it.

176
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:57,279
And I think you can get away with it. But, not here.

177
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,460
What is your problem?

178
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:03,460
Not. Here.

179
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,559
I don't go on dates. I don't go clubbing.

180
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:19,460
I don't care about celebrity hookups or which sports team just won.

181
00:22:20,599 --> 00:22:24,759
My universe exists entirely within computers.

182
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:28,979
The moment we come up with a way to not have to eat, or sleep

183
00:22:29,099 --> 00:22:33,480
or any of the other things required to stay alive... I'll be the first in line.

184
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:38,440
And by in line, I mean online, breaking in and reading about it.

185
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:43,580
Then, Bitchan and I will get together and bootstrap a homebrew version for ourselves.

186
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:47,860
Because copyrights, patents, trademarks, and all the other

187
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:51,120
ephemeral concepts of ownership are a time-bomb.

188
00:22:52,119 --> 00:22:56,039
Animal trainers teach a dog by giving the dog some treat it likes.

189
00:22:56,759 --> 00:22:59,220
They call this paying the dog.

190
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:03,840
I do what I do for love. Anything else is a form of slavery

191
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:05,839
a reduction of my humanity.

192
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:09,440
Which is why I feel the moral liberty to search through Emergent See's

193
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,220
network and download all of their recently developed programs.

194
00:23:13,579 --> 00:23:19,000
After all, they are a government contractor. In this country, that means they work for me.

195
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:25,640
Ownership is an illusion. I don't value money.

196
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:30,579
I acquiesce to social norms only in so much as it's required

197
00:23:30,619 --> 00:23:33,919
to keep myself alive... and connected.

198
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:15,880
Take a look at the world around you.

199
00:24:16,259 --> 00:24:19,940
You get in your car, which is run by a computer.

200
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:23,160
You watch TV, which is run by computers.

201
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:29,700
Any concept you have a world that doesn't involve electronics is naive.

202
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:35,799
Of course, you can manufacture a reality to suit your delusions if you like.

203
00:24:36,339 --> 00:24:38,319
What difference does that make to me?

204
00:24:39,099 --> 00:24:41,799
It's just one less person I have to deal with.

205
00:24:41,799 --> 00:24:46,460
Because, if that's your choice, then you are irrelevant.

206
00:24:47,099 --> 00:24:50,119
You cease to exist in any meaningful way

207
00:24:50,339 --> 00:24:53,699
except as extremely low-hanging fruit.

208
00:24:54,279 --> 00:24:59,639
That is, until you get a seat on the senate and make idiotic laws

209
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:02,240
like the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.

210
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,279
Copyright hinges on two interrelated ideas:

211
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:08,799
One, scarcity.

212
00:25:09,539 --> 00:25:14,399
Two, if we want a section of our society dedicated to making cool stuff

213
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:18,160
then we've got to keep the people who create that stuff alive

214
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:20,160
and doing what they do best

215
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,960
like Emergent See's program called Shepherd.

216
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:27,880
I open it up, read a few lines of hex, and quickly recognize none of it.

217
00:25:28,759 --> 00:25:33,879
But Hash... he codes like stream-of-consciousness poetry.

218
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:39,100
Maybe he can make sense of Shepherd.

219
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:17,140
I slurped a bunch of programs from a network I hacked into.

220
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:19,319
Any cool ones?

221
00:26:19,319 --> 00:26:21,319
One's interesting.

222
00:26:22,259 --> 00:26:24,059
Where did you get it?

223
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:26,600
Emergent See.

224
00:26:28,359 --> 00:26:31,839
That's some serious shit, man. Did you disable Wi-Fi?

225
00:26:31,839 --> 00:26:33,839
Yeah. But, I don't know what it did.

226
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:39,720
Okay. To hell with it. Let's take a look.

227
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:44,420
Okay. So, type shepherd.

228
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,920
Shepherd? They called it Shepherd?

229
00:26:47,779 --> 00:26:49,359
Pride comes before a fall.

230
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:50,599
I know, right?

231
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:56,960
Okay. It's a bit sparse.

232
00:26:57,319 --> 00:27:01,099
This part looks like a standard terminal...

233
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:06,160
But, this code here looks like it's trying to start an SSH tunnel.

234
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:10,960
Where's it calling?

235
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:17,519
It's calling? I don't... I don't know.

236
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,360
Do you think it's government?

237
00:27:20,539 --> 00:27:24,079
Who knows? We need to give it access to find out.

238
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:27,500
Well... they'll know where we are.

239
00:27:28,019 --> 00:27:31,920
And that's why, my friend, we're so close to the neighbors.

240
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,620
It'll buy us a couple minutes.

241
00:27:36,619 --> 00:27:38,500
Any preferences?

242
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:47,020
Ah... I love the communal nature of San Francisco.

243
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:51,100
So caring. So sharing.

244
00:27:51,099 --> 00:27:53,439
So love-ed.

245
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:56,580
Best Mike Myers movie ever!

246
00:27:58,579 --> 00:28:02,139
Okay. Well, that's as far as I go.

247
00:28:02,279 --> 00:28:05,299
Whatever it is, they don't want company.

248
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:13,259
Be careful, Will. Sudonym was right.

249
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:17,259
Emergent See's nasty... like Orwellian and shit.

250
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,640
Maybe Decimate can hack in.

251
00:28:23,579 --> 00:28:28,279
Well, meanwhile, I'm going to stream So I Married an Axe Murderer.

252
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:31,380
She stole my heart and my cat.

253
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:56,120
We know two things about Shepherd:

254
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:59,680
One, it's calling something outside itself.

255
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:03,240
Two, it leads to a login screen.

256
00:29:03,779 --> 00:29:06,720
Doing that in public was not smart.

257
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:15,019
I've got to go someplace where Wi-Fi signals can't escape.

258
00:29:20,039 --> 00:29:23,980
You know those crazy people who wear aluminum foil hats

259
00:29:24,039 --> 00:29:27,379
to protect themselves from the brainwashing space-rays?

260
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:32,680
The space-rays don't exist. But the foil?

261
00:29:33,079 --> 00:29:36,879
That reflects almost all radio signals in existence.

262
00:29:37,599 --> 00:29:41,099
It's similar to what the CIA uses to make their black-rooms.

263
00:29:41,339 --> 00:29:45,199
And yes, the do call them black-rooms.

264
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:51,920
Of course, if you don't ground it, the reflective metal becomes a giant antenna.

265
00:29:52,319 --> 00:29:56,559
So, the crazies, with the foil hats are actually amplifying

266
00:29:56,559 --> 00:30:00,919
the fictitious space-rays, if they wear rubber-soled shoes.

267
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:50,799
Today's questions are: what is Shepherd doing; and who is it built for.

268
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:11,099
Whoever wrote Shepherd spent a long time doing it.

269
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:14,200
The entire thing is written in a proprietary language.

270
00:33:14,319 --> 00:33:18,059
And, since my debugger only understands standard languages

271
00:33:18,059 --> 00:33:21,200
there's just too much code to know what it's doing.

272
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:23,820
On to question two.

273
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:26,140
Who is Shepherd built for.

274
00:33:27,019 --> 00:33:30,900
Time for some Cartesian logic: any system can be understood

275
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,579
if you break it down to its component parts.

276
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:36,720
Study the parts, figure out what they do

277
00:33:36,779 --> 00:33:40,019
then you'll have a pretty good idea of what the whole thing is doing.

278
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:45,480
But, like I said, it would take weeks to figure out all of Shepherd.

279
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:49,319
So, I look for one very specific part.

280
00:33:50,039 --> 00:33:53,180
I only need to find out who it's trying to talk to.

281
00:33:53,779 --> 00:33:57,240
That will be a single ingredient... one number.

282
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:01,019
The IP address of the server it's calling.

283
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:31,480
In the late 1950s, MIT hackers believed as I do

284
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:33,960
that information should be free.

285
00:34:34,179 --> 00:34:38,399
This ideology leads people to call us crypto-anarchists

286
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:42,139
an oversimplification to the point of error.

287
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:45,539
Just because I don't hold to the tenets of a government

288
00:34:45,619 --> 00:34:48,980
quickly devolving into fascism doesn't make me an anarchist.

289
00:34:49,219 --> 00:34:52,459
I don't have a label for what I do... beyond "hacker".

290
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:54,960
You could just as easily call me a libertarian.

291
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:58,940
Except, I'm not sure government has a place at all

292
00:34:59,019 --> 00:35:02,659
or what it might look like in a future without conventional trade.

293
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:08,960
Or, maybe communist is right... except that means that all are community property

294
00:35:09,059 --> 00:35:13,440
as opposed to no one owning anything, which is closer to how I feel.

295
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:25,260
Godwin's Law states that as online discussions grow longer

296
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:30,519
the probability of comparisons involving Nazis or Hitler approaches certainty.

297
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:35,079
The reason for this is because we, as a species, don't like vagaries.

298
00:35:35,639 --> 00:35:38,879
It's because we come from people who needed to know

299
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:44,579
whether or not there was a tiger in the woods. Their lives depended on it.

300
00:35:55,840 --> 00:36:00,860
My neighbor Brian bakes meth for the Oakland chapter of an infamous biker gang.

301
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:04,220
Walter White, he's not.

302
00:36:04,739 --> 00:36:07,119
The idiot must have blown himself up.

303
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:11,159
The sentence for manufacturing an illegal controlled substance in the

304
00:36:11,159 --> 00:36:14,179
state of California is usually up to 7 years.

305
00:36:15,179 --> 00:36:18,599
Normal computer crimes can be up to 9 years.

306
00:36:19,199 --> 00:36:23,819
Breaking into top-secret government computer systems and copying files?

307
00:36:24,139 --> 00:36:26,639
They call that terrorism now days

308
00:36:27,099 --> 00:36:31,039
at which point the laws have been getting a bit hazy.

309
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:36,780
If I'm lucky, the fire that took Brian also melted any evidence in my loft too.

310
00:36:37,079 --> 00:36:41,059
If not, DHS now has me on their list

311
00:36:41,059 --> 00:36:43,440
somewhere near the top.

312
00:36:46,139 --> 00:36:50,599
Excuse me, Katherine. Is Sudo...  I mean, is Susan around?

313
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:57,599
It's Kat. And Sudonym's in the back.

314
00:37:04,019 --> 00:37:06,099
You asshole.

315
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:09,380
What're you talking about?

316
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:12,140
Hash told me what you did.

317
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:14,900
After I told you not to.

318
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:18,360
An hour ago they came and took him.

319
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:24,200
You did that... asshole.

320
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:27,539
Hey! Hey!!

321
00:37:27,539 --> 00:37:28,239
Wait a second...

322
00:37:28,239 --> 00:37:30,000
Are you listening to me!?

323
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,679
You did that LU$er!

324
00:37:33,199 --> 00:37:37,639
I don't know who those guys were, but they came in here because you decided to steal some government shit for lulz.

325
00:37:37,639 --> 00:37:38,420
You don't understand...

326
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:41,980
No. It's not that I don't understand.

327
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:45,420
It's that I don't care... about you.

328
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:47,420
...not anymore.

329
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:55,020
Why are you still here?

330
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:58,340
I don't have any place to go.

331
00:37:58,340 --> 00:37:59,980
Do I care?

332
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:01,559
You did.

333
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:08,280
Do. I. Care?

334
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,120
No.

335
00:38:14,699 --> 00:38:16,899
Get the hell out of my bar.

336
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:06,599
Correlation without causation: that's when two things seem to be related but aren't.

337
00:39:07,739 --> 00:39:11,379
You have two data-points: Ice cream sales, and drownings.

338
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:16,300
You notice that as ice cream sales increase, so do drownings.

339
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:20,119
You could assume ice cream makes people drown

340
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:24,240
or you could just look at your calendar and realize it's summer.

341
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:29,579
So, at first, the two facts look related.

342
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:32,539
But, logic tells you they're not.

343
00:39:33,519 --> 00:39:38,079
Then you see a third factor, that they are related

344
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:41,240
just not in the way you first thought.

345
00:39:48,639 --> 00:39:50,279
What is Shepherd?

346
00:39:52,679 --> 00:39:55,019
It could just be a login screen.

347
00:39:58,300 --> 00:39:59,640
But, to what?

348
00:40:01,239 --> 00:40:02,539
I don't know.

349
00:40:05,139 --> 00:40:08,259
Whoever it is, they want it hidden.

350
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:15,019
Bit, this sucks.

351
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:18,740
Yeah? What did you expect would happen?

352
00:40:18,739 --> 00:40:20,739
I don't know. Not this.

353
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:27,760
What about Hash? Sudonym hates me.

354
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:34,580
Figure it out. Maybe she'll forgive you.

355
00:40:38,639 --> 00:40:40,219
What the hell, Will?

356
00:40:41,159 --> 00:40:42,000
Come on...

357
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,400
Oh my god.

358
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:46,539
15 years and you're not even curious?

359
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:52,099
Jesus. No! You're Like my brother! And, you're drunk!

360
00:40:54,099 --> 00:40:55,259
You might like it.

361
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:57,260
You might like jerking off.

362
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:02,440
What if Brian didn't cause the fire?

363
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:06,260
What if Emergent See traced Shepherd back to me?

364
00:41:07,199 --> 00:41:11,500
Which still leaves the question: who's Shepherd calling?

365
00:41:11,679 --> 00:41:12,599
Bit!

366
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:17,760
I watched Shepherd in action. I saw the login screen at the park.

367
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:22,600
So, why isn't the IP address working?

368
00:41:22,599 --> 00:41:23,699
Megumi!

369
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:29,639
About last night... I'm sorry.

370
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:35,099
I know. You're a guy. It's expected.

371
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:40,240
It's just that the bastards burned down my apartment. They stole my friend... they kidnapped him.

372
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:44,920
I don't know what they're doing with him or where. I don't know if he's even still alive.

373
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:47,440
Well, you did hack their network.

374
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,640
You're on their side?

375
00:41:53,219 --> 00:41:55,500
What you did was pretty stupid, Will.

376
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:59,699
You don't even know what Shepherd does.

377
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:03,059
So help me find out.

378
00:42:03,099 --> 00:42:05,279
So black-op agents can come and kidnap me?

379
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,280
That's not going to happen.

380
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:12,900
Please, tell me your plan... if you even have one.

381
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:21,159
Find out what they're doing and why.

382
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:24,260
Vague and probably impossible.

383
00:42:27,179 --> 00:42:30,519
The moment you touch Shepherd something bad happens.

384
00:42:33,079 --> 00:42:34,880
So, then, that's where we start?

385
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,059
What?

386
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:45,740
Whoever owns Shepherd... anytime they see it running, they send someone, right?

387
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:50,380
Twice doesn't make it a trend... but, sure.

388
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:56,620
So, we run Shepherd and let them come to us.

389
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:00,559
And when they come with their guns?

390
00:43:18,019 --> 00:43:20,500
Nobody's coming. It's clear.

391
00:43:31,059 --> 00:43:32,739
It's done. Come on.

392
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:48,720
Stakeouts are so much cooler in the movies.

393
00:43:50,099 --> 00:43:55,259
Yeah. But if this works, we'll have something.

394
00:43:57,679 --> 00:44:02,119
Yeah. If they don't see us... if they don't catch us, whoever they are.

395
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:07,519
Did you put your camera in my bag?

396
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:09,800
Yeah.

397
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:15,980
Put your phone down. Keep watch.

398
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:16,860
Why?

399
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:18,860
I have to pee.

400
00:44:30,679 --> 00:44:31,179
What?

401
00:44:31,179 --> 00:44:33,179
What? You think girls don't have to pee?

402
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:36,220
Feel free.

403
00:44:37,079 --> 00:44:39,239
Unfair.

404
00:44:43,559 --> 00:44:44,579
Bit.

405
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:46,580
What?

406
00:44:48,579 --> 00:44:50,739
I know you don't... like me.

407
00:44:51,559 --> 00:44:57,239
Of course I like you. You're like my brother, and best friend, all in one.

408
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:00,700
No. I meant, attracted to me.

409
00:45:00,739 --> 00:45:04,399
I know what you meant. I was just trying to let you off easy.

410
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:06,220
Easy?

411
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:08,960
I thought you said you were sorry.

412
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:09,820
I am.

413
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:13,880
Then why are you bringing this up again?

414
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:17,099
I don't know.

415
00:45:19,139 --> 00:45:24,980
I'm just curious. Something to pass the time.

416
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:28,059
Why wait until now?

417
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:33,260
I didn't wait. That was just the first time you noticed.

418
00:45:36,099 --> 00:45:40,839
Then what, Will? Suddenly, you think I'm going to invite you into my room?

419
00:45:42,199 --> 00:45:43,079
No.

420
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:46,039
You could fuck me all night.

421
00:45:46,039 --> 00:45:47,659
That's not what I meant.

422
00:45:57,659 --> 00:45:58,719
What? What?

423
00:45:58,719 --> 00:45:59,439
You see that?

424
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:01,440
Get the camera. Get the camera.

425
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:04,720
All we need is a licence... just get the license plate.

426
00:46:06,679 --> 00:46:09,460
Get down, get down. Did they see us?

427
00:46:09,539 --> 00:46:11,279
Did they see us?

428
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:13,280
I don't know.

429
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:24,599
Okay. Take the... take the picture.

430
00:46:24,599 --> 00:46:25,659
Okay.

431
00:46:37,780 --> 00:46:41,260
What's going on? Come on. Did they see us? Do you think they saw us?

432
00:46:41,260 --> 00:46:43,260
I... I don't know.

433
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:52,820
Son of a bitch, that was close. Did you get it? Did you get it?

434
00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:54,820
Let's just get out of here.

435
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:04,599
It didn't work.

436
00:47:04,599 --> 00:47:08,239
We know that. Try the next one.

437
00:47:15,739 --> 00:47:17,759
Now what?

438
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:22,440
When do you want to go back and get the Can?

439
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:27,420
It's only going to give us an IP address, not a password.

440
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:35,679
I have to go to work. I'll be back later tonight.

441
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:15,079
It's called port knocking. You want to talk to Server X, which won't respond.

442
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:19,820
The only way to get it to respond is to query Servers A through E

443
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:23,480
in a certain order, during a specified period of time.

444
00:48:24,239 --> 00:48:27,459
Only then does Server X talk back.

445
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:34,900
In this case, 212.3.208.65

446
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:38,579
That's why the IP I got from the black-room didn't work

447
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:41,960
and why I just got a different IP from the Can-of-Worm.

448
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,219
Of course, that doesn't solve the login screen.

449
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:05,500
I'm not dressed.

450
00:49:06,659 --> 00:49:08,460
I got the IP.

451
00:49:09,719 --> 00:49:12,859
I went back and got the Can and it had the IP in it.

452
00:49:20,139 --> 00:49:21,779
Did anyone see you?

453
00:49:22,579 --> 00:49:27,179
Some nosey neighbor. I told him I was with the phone company.

454
00:49:29,179 --> 00:49:31,279
How do you know he was local?

455
00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:34,780
How do you know he wasn't with them?

456
00:49:35,219 --> 00:49:38,919
That... that's just paranoid. I mean, he just walked up to me and...

457
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:42,679
Paranoid? Don't be an idiot, Will.

458
00:49:43,099 --> 00:49:46,460
It's not just your shitty life on the line anymore, okay?

459
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:41,120
Dude! What is your problem? You ever heard of calling first?

460
00:50:41,179 --> 00:50:42,480
You told me to come over.

461
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:43,900
Not a good time.

462
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:44,619
It's important.

463
00:50:44,619 --> 00:50:47,139
Then why wait until we're inside? Tell me now.

464
00:50:47,380 --> 00:50:50,500
I found the IP address Shepherd's been trying to reach.

465
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:53,960
I'll be back in a second.

466
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:55,960
And the ice?

467
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:57,960
Yeah. That too.

468
00:50:58,260 --> 00:51:02,500
I know you think this is important, but it can wait.

469
00:51:02,860 --> 00:51:04,180
It's 212.3...

470
00:51:04,179 --> 00:51:06,759
.208.65, I know.

471
00:51:08,619 --> 00:51:09,460
How?

472
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:13,699
Will? Will. What do I do for a living?

473
00:51:14,639 --> 00:51:16,379
You're a hacker.

474
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:18,460
And who do I work for?

475
00:51:19,539 --> 00:51:20,779
I don't know.

476
00:51:21,159 --> 00:51:24,779
I work for governments. Major multi-national companies.

477
00:51:25,219 --> 00:51:27,859
Finding an IP address is noob shit.

478
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:32,539
Mister Big Shot... I'm gonna need a few more tests.

479
00:51:34,119 --> 00:51:37,019
Now, do you have something useful... or not?

480
00:51:37,019 --> 00:51:38,219
They've got Hash.

481
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:43,620
I know. Kat came here for comfort, and I'd like to get back to that.

482
00:51:44,599 --> 00:51:46,920
I need the password for the login screen.

483
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:51,860
I have to know what it does and why they're willing to kidnap people.

484
00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:58,779
Will, whatever it is, it's bad. I know that; It always is.

485
00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:03,260
It's going to be something you'll want to forget, but you won't be able to.

486
00:52:03,460 --> 00:52:09,079
It will change your worldview. And, it will either make you an activist, or apathetic.

487
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:11,920
Is that what you want?

488
00:52:13,019 --> 00:52:13,619
Yes.

489
00:52:13,659 --> 00:52:18,139
Are you sure? There's no going back, Will. Not ever.

490
00:52:19,460 --> 00:52:21,179
I need to know.

491
00:52:21,219 --> 00:52:23,139
Time for your medicine.

492
00:52:23,139 --> 00:52:25,139
Don't come in.

493
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:34,960
Are you sure about this?

494
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:36,639
What is it?

495
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:39,000
What do you think?

496
00:52:40,539 --> 00:52:41,940
You wrote it down?

497
00:52:41,940 --> 00:52:43,940
Sure. Why not?

498
00:52:45,139 --> 00:52:47,480
That is the stupidest password I've ever seen.

499
00:52:47,659 --> 00:52:52,099
It's actually pretty good: more than eight characters, a capital letter, and a symbol.

500
00:52:52,099 --> 00:52:54,099
Props to Michael Mitchell.

501
00:52:55,199 --> 00:52:57,000
Head of the NSA.

502
00:52:57,380 --> 00:53:01,680
You wanted access. He's probably got the most. Have fun.

503
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:05,480
Wait, wait, wait. How did you get this?

504
00:53:06,719 --> 00:53:10,259
He didn't give it to me, if that's what you're asking.

505
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:19,000
Thanks. I owe you.

506
00:53:19,059 --> 00:53:24,079
No you don't. Not this time. Not for that.

507
00:54:12,039 --> 00:54:17,019
It's not a puzzle anymore. Now, it's something else.

508
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,380
DHS probably thinks I'm dead.

509
00:54:20,380 --> 00:54:23,079
They have everyone they think knows about Shepherd.

510
00:54:23,199 --> 00:54:25,279
I could leave it alone and disappear.

511
00:54:25,340 --> 00:54:28,680
Pull a Kevin Mitnick, sans the getting caught part.

512
00:54:29,199 --> 00:54:34,199
Of course, Mitnick now makes millions as a security consultant.

513
00:54:34,340 --> 00:54:37,539
I just need to terminate some of my social connections

514
00:54:38,300 --> 00:54:43,280
So my trail never leads back to them... or from them to me.

515
00:55:09,019 --> 00:55:10,440
Where were you?

516
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:13,000
I talked to Decimate.

517
00:55:14,579 --> 00:55:16,779
Yeah. He had plans.

518
00:55:17,139 --> 00:55:21,879
I know. How did you know?

519
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:27,880
So, what were you doing for the rest of the night?

520
00:55:32,159 --> 00:55:37,359
Thinking. Wondering when... when does this thing end?

521
00:55:41,420 --> 00:55:43,099
Are you staying here?

522
00:55:43,099 --> 00:55:44,199
No.

523
00:55:49,739 --> 00:55:51,539
You started it, Will.

524
00:55:51,539 --> 00:55:52,699
I know.

525
00:55:53,239 --> 00:55:56,039
So, what's the problem?

526
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:02,500
I think I should let it go.

527
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:06,760
What happened to your curiosity?

528
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:09,700
Too many people are getting hurt.

529
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:12,780
This country is supposed to be free.

530
00:56:13,519 --> 00:56:16,440
I don't care about politics.

531
00:56:16,820 --> 00:56:19,620
It's not about politics.

532
00:56:22,019 --> 00:56:24,639
It's about an idea, Will. It's...

533
00:56:24,980 --> 00:56:28,400
...If people knew about this?

534
00:56:38,119 --> 00:56:42,920
Finish this. It's not about you anymore.

535
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:07,380
An open Wi-Fi network is one more hop they'll have to make to find me.

536
00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:09,980
Then, there's TOR.

537
00:57:10,039 --> 00:57:13,779
TOR was designed by the Navy so their informants could login

538
00:57:13,780 --> 00:57:17,880
and give them secret information from a country they're not supposed to be in.

539
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:22,140
Logging into Shepherd is scary however I do it.

540
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:29,300
The fact that it's a tracking program doesn't help.

541
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:34,880
Who can it track? I wonder if it can track Hash.

542
00:58:01,179 --> 00:58:03,279
How would you wake him up?

543
00:58:07,239 --> 00:58:13,359
No. No knives. Subtle, remember?

544
00:58:20,699 --> 00:58:23,619
How hot's your tea?

545
00:58:36,980 --> 00:58:42,320
Rise and shine, buddy. Rise and shine.

546
00:59:07,940 --> 00:59:10,619
Movie time, Charles.

547
00:59:12,619 --> 00:59:17,159
This is a video of you, at a park bench...

548
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:22,300
As you attempt to access a top-secret database.

549
00:59:23,699 --> 00:59:29,299
Look, Hash. We know you did it. Okay?

550
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:33,440
Lying to us just makes life much more painful for you.

551
00:59:36,059 --> 00:59:43,500
The video shows a man named William Vernor Stephenson giving you the laptop.

552
00:59:43,940 --> 00:59:50,340
See, we were able to track his phone, but we lost his data around 6:00pm

553
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:57,740
Ah, but your phone... we got that for days.

554
01:00:09,860 --> 01:00:18,820
Look. Just tell us where William is, and what you plan on doing with Shepherd.

555
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:24,599
What happens when I know everything: The Age of Aquarius, or 1984?

556
01:00:25,300 --> 01:00:29,100
The U.S. government rarely builds its own technology.

557
01:00:29,320 --> 01:00:33,380
They hire Raytheon to maintain a radar station in Alaska.

558
01:00:34,239 --> 01:00:38,559
SAIC took over remote viewing when the Army got tired of it.

559
01:00:39,079 --> 01:00:44,659
And Emergent See built the login app for the most powerful monitoring system ever conceived.

560
01:00:44,659 --> 01:00:46,000
Sudonym?

561
01:00:46,079 --> 01:00:48,699
And probably the search engine on the back-end too.

562
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:52,480
Kat, would you get her please. This is important.

563
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:54,599
What do you want?

564
01:00:54,579 --> 01:00:56,179
We need to talk.

565
01:00:56,900 --> 01:00:58,340
Then talk.

566
01:00:58,619 --> 01:01:00,579
Not here. In the back.

567
01:01:28,820 --> 01:01:33,559
Does it bother you that the NSA monitors everything that you do online?

568
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:40,400
Does it bother you that you're afraid of a government that claims to be for you?

569
01:01:40,619 --> 01:01:45,179
That both private and public companies know where you are, right now.

570
01:01:45,659 --> 01:01:49,420
Who gives a shit? Why should I care?

571
01:01:49,820 --> 01:01:51,320
What's your name?

572
01:01:51,820 --> 01:01:52,539
Eddie.

573
01:01:52,539 --> 01:01:54,539
Eddie...

574
01:01:54,539 --> 01:01:55,599
Brannon.

575
01:01:55,599 --> 01:01:56,579
Brannon.

576
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:02,599
What were you doing last night, Eddie?

577
01:02:02,599 --> 01:02:04,819
Sitting at home, watching TV.

578
01:02:05,340 --> 01:02:06,820
What were you watching?

579
01:02:07,039 --> 01:02:10,039
I don't remember. Something on Netflix.

580
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:12,619
That good?

581
01:02:18,420 --> 01:02:20,539
Ink!

582
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:26,039
You got good taste in movies, Eddie. That's a good movie.

583
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:28,159
What the hell is this?

584
01:02:28,159 --> 01:02:30,159
It's a tracking program.

585
01:02:30,159 --> 01:02:31,480
What's it track?

586
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:33,920
Everything.

587
01:02:35,039 --> 01:02:39,199
See what I mean? I don't do anything wrong. So, who cares?

588
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:43,380
That's good. You know who else didn't do anything wrong?

589
01:02:43,420 --> 01:02:49,340
A guy named Robert Martin. At least, that's not why he was kidnapped two days ago.

590
01:02:49,340 --> 01:02:51,340
You want to know what he's doing now?

591
01:02:51,340 --> 01:02:53,340
Hey, that's enough.

592
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:06,720
I'm a software engineer at Dean &amp; Dean. I don't even know what Shepherd is!

593
01:03:07,539 --> 01:03:12,480
I want to believe you. I do. But we have records showing...

594
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:14,780
...that you tried to access Shepherd from your house.

595
01:03:14,780 --> 01:03:19,640
Oh, come on. I don't know. I don't. I told you everything I know.

596
01:03:27,159 --> 01:03:28,980
Would you like a cup of coffee?

597
01:03:28,980 --> 01:03:30,440
Sure. Remember, no cream.

598
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:31,659
And two sugars.

599
01:03:31,659 --> 01:03:32,579
Only one today...

600
01:03:32,579 --> 01:03:34,139
Why are you doing this?

601
01:03:34,139 --> 01:03:36,139
Because you wouldn't talk to me.

602
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:39,440
You're an asshole.

603
01:03:39,780 --> 01:03:44,180
Whatever the reason, that's what she said and I want to live long enough to enjoy my pension.

604
01:03:51,420 --> 01:03:53,700
Why!

605
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:58,400
Robert. This is just a job to me and I'm going to come in

606
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:02,200
tomorrow and it's either going to be you in that chair or somebody else...

607
01:04:02,199 --> 01:04:04,199
...and it really doesn't matter to me.

608
01:04:04,199 --> 01:04:09,799
I've told you everything I know. Come on!

609
01:04:10,219 --> 01:04:12,859
This can stop anytime or go on as long as you want.

610
01:04:12,860 --> 01:04:15,620
Come on! No... no...

611
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,920
What the hell is wrong with you!

612
01:04:26,920 --> 01:04:27,840
I know you're mad.

613
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:33,460
Mad!? You show torture, in my bar, in San Francisco.

614
01:04:33,460 --> 01:04:36,820
Will, think for a moment!

615
01:04:37,860 --> 01:04:39,000
There's something else.

616
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:42,460
Yeah. You're right. You logged onto a government website

617
01:04:42,460 --> 01:04:45,159
to show a tracking program that tracks everything.

618
01:04:45,159 --> 01:04:46,719
You saw me use TOR.

619
01:04:46,760 --> 01:04:50,580
And you think the CIA or whoever's behind this, you think they haven't cracked TOR?

620
01:04:50,579 --> 01:04:51,819
No. They haven't.

621
01:04:51,820 --> 01:04:55,240
And you know this how? Because, if they have...

622
01:04:55,679 --> 01:04:58,779
If they trace this back to me?

623
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:04,240
Damn it, Will. They kidnap people. They torture people.

624
01:05:04,239 --> 01:05:08,919
Yes. That's what I wanted to talk to you about.

625
01:05:09,219 --> 01:05:11,599
Just think about somebody other than yourself.

626
01:05:11,599 --> 01:05:14,779
I have been. That's why I'm here.

627
01:05:16,940 --> 01:05:19,820
They have Hash.

628
01:05:22,860 --> 01:05:26,740
I know. I was here when they took him.

629
01:05:26,780 --> 01:05:32,840
No. They have him and I found him.

630
01:05:37,059 --> 01:05:38,500
Show me.

631
01:05:42,619 --> 01:05:45,219
You're not gonna like this.

632
01:06:06,380 --> 01:06:08,059
Where is he?

633
01:06:08,500 --> 01:06:12,440
611 Folsom. Downtown, south of Market.

634
01:06:13,099 --> 01:06:15,779
We gotta get him out.

635
01:06:18,219 --> 01:06:20,459
This is Homeland Security.

636
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:24,720
They're working with the NSA and Emergent See.

637
01:06:24,719 --> 01:06:26,719
We can't just leave him there.

638
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:33,680
Bitchan and I can break into their system.

639
01:06:33,739 --> 01:06:38,039
But you're gonna need to be there to pick him up, when and if he comes out.

640
01:06:38,039 --> 01:06:40,460
And we're gonna need your servers.

641
01:06:40,460 --> 01:06:42,800
You want to just hack them?

642
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:44,220
They'll trace it, Will.

643
01:06:44,219 --> 01:06:45,199
No, not this time.

644
01:06:45,199 --> 01:06:49,239
They will trace it, and then who knows how many people you're gonna have to bail out.

645
01:06:49,239 --> 01:06:51,239
I already have two.

646
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:58,080
There is another possibility, but it's a lot scarier

647
01:06:58,079 --> 01:07:01,079
and it is going to add you to their list.

648
01:07:02,980 --> 01:07:05,519
We gotta get him out.

649
01:07:20,820 --> 01:07:22,360
If I don't come out...

650
01:07:22,360 --> 01:07:24,360
Are you sure he's here?

651
01:07:25,039 --> 01:07:26,360
This is it.

652
01:07:28,360 --> 01:07:30,260
Get him out.

653
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:13,219
Are you ever gonna come in on-time?

654
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:20,880
You know what your problem is? You're too serious.

655
01:08:24,079 --> 01:08:27,920
We're fighting terrorism. Alright? Do you want another 9-11?

656
01:08:30,739 --> 01:08:34,619
Whatever. Someday, when you realize how much

657
01:08:34,619 --> 01:08:37,099
shit actually goes down, you'll relax.

658
01:08:38,020 --> 01:08:42,500
I don't know what I'm expecting. Maybe two armed guards and a full-body scanner.

659
01:08:43,039 --> 01:08:46,000
This place looks more like a library, or a school.

660
01:08:46,060 --> 01:08:49,720
Anything but a domestic prison for advanced interrogation.

661
01:08:49,720 --> 01:08:51,100
What's this regarding?

662
01:08:51,100 --> 01:08:52,579
Prisoner transfer.

663
01:08:52,659 --> 01:08:56,500
I guess that's the point when you violate the people's trust on this scale.

664
01:08:56,500 --> 01:09:00,140
Discretion is more important than function.

665
01:09:00,140 --> 01:09:03,460
So, transfer. That's weird. What's this about?

666
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:07,119
I don't know. I don't ask.

667
01:09:08,100 --> 01:09:13,840
I asked once. That's why I'm running these errands instead of being a field agent.

668
01:09:15,840 --> 01:09:20,159
I know what you mean. I asked once and I didn't sleep for a week.

669
01:09:21,539 --> 01:09:23,880
So, who do you want to work on today?

670
01:09:28,079 --> 01:09:30,059
Martin's dead.

671
01:09:32,060 --> 01:09:35,860
Sometimes Julie overdoes it a bit. I told her to take it easy.

672
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:39,680
Oh. It looks like Robert Martin isn't here anymore.

673
01:09:40,680 --> 01:09:42,760
That's not what I was told.

674
01:09:43,140 --> 01:09:45,780
The database was just updated.

675
01:09:46,380 --> 01:09:52,039
Pneumonia I understand. But, letting a subject die during an interrogation?

676
01:09:52,039 --> 01:09:54,640
That's just irresponsible.

677
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:58,920
Sorry. Anyway, Charles Drake should be coming right out.

678
01:09:58,920 --> 01:10:01,800
That leaves Charles Drake.

679
01:10:02,939 --> 01:10:05,799
Well. Drake it is.

680
01:10:21,560 --> 01:10:23,740
How you doing today, Charlie?

681
01:10:25,500 --> 01:10:28,340
They really went to town on you, huh?

682
01:10:28,859 --> 01:10:33,239
I got some good news. You're getting out a here, buddy.

683
01:10:39,579 --> 01:10:42,720
So, what do you want to try next with Drake?

684
01:10:44,319 --> 01:10:46,639
I don't know.

685
01:10:49,619 --> 01:10:51,359
How about the microwave?

686
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:56,779
I heard that wasn't gonna come in for another couple weeks.

687
01:10:57,859 --> 01:11:00,839
No. It came in this morning.

688
01:11:02,840 --> 01:11:06,380
That's right. Prisoner transfer.

689
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:10,520
I don't know where they're sending you

690
01:11:10,520 --> 01:11:13,080
but it's gotta be better than this place, right?

691
01:11:14,279 --> 01:11:16,779
Okay. Let's go.

692
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:22,220
Someone's gonna change your clothes and walk you out of here, okay?

693
01:11:25,020 --> 01:11:28,260
He doesn't have any fillings, does he?

694
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:32,039
No. I checked earlier.

695
01:11:32,060 --> 01:11:36,480
That's good. You don't want to see what happens to someone with fillings.

696
01:11:37,220 --> 01:11:38,480
I've seen it.

697
01:11:38,479 --> 01:11:42,739
Gnarly old burn marks all over the inside of their mouth. God.

698
01:11:45,539 --> 01:11:48,159
And this guy, it wasn't even in his records.

699
01:11:48,680 --> 01:11:52,400
He must have had it done in Tijuana or something.

700
01:11:52,899 --> 01:11:58,659
Anyway, they turned the emitter on and sparks just started flying from this guys mouth.

701
01:12:00,659 --> 01:12:03,260
And the emitter tech, he pukes on me.

702
01:12:29,460 --> 01:12:31,279
Did they move him?

703
01:12:32,119 --> 01:12:33,279
No.

704
01:12:37,319 --> 01:12:41,199
So, he's in here. 'Cause I know he didn't escape.

705
01:12:50,520 --> 01:12:52,840
No! He's not in here!

706
01:12:55,039 --> 01:12:56,220
I know that.

707
01:12:58,520 --> 01:13:00,100
So, they moved him.

708
01:13:03,399 --> 01:13:07,619
That kind of thing happens all the time. Let's go check with the front desk.

709
01:13:38,399 --> 01:13:41,219
Have you seen a Charles Drake?

710
01:13:41,220 --> 01:13:43,220
Yeah. He just left.

711
01:13:44,220 --> 01:13:45,420
Stop.

712
01:14:04,020 --> 01:14:05,640
They're gone.

713
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:07,640
What? You're just gonna let them get away?

714
01:14:08,359 --> 01:14:12,439
No. I'm going to send a team out after them and bring them back

715
01:14:12,439 --> 01:14:14,799
the same way we did it the first time.

716
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:30,340
I'm saying we use the tools available to us.

717
01:14:30,539 --> 01:14:33,560
Alright? Track them with their cell phones. They have GPS.

718
01:14:35,560 --> 01:14:37,100
Where's Martin?

719
01:14:37,100 --> 01:14:39,100
They probably killed him.

720
01:14:39,100 --> 01:14:42,960
Wait. What? How do you know?

721
01:14:43,640 --> 01:14:48,480
Two reasons: One, he wasn't there this morning.

722
01:14:48,479 --> 01:14:52,099
Two, they don't transfer people out of there.

723
01:14:55,020 --> 01:14:57,220
We can't go anywhere we've ever been.

724
01:14:57,220 --> 01:14:57,780
So...

725
01:14:57,779 --> 01:15:00,559
We... we. They know where we've been.

726
01:15:01,420 --> 01:15:06,039
They know everyone that we know. They know everyone that we've ever talked to.

727
01:15:06,779 --> 01:15:10,619
They're probably tracking us right now. Turn off your phone.

728
01:15:10,619 --> 01:15:11,699
Where am I supposed to go?

729
01:15:11,699 --> 01:15:13,699
I don't know!

730
01:15:17,960 --> 01:15:19,600
Out of town.

731
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:23,640
Take 280 south. I need some time to think.

732
01:15:25,359 --> 01:15:27,639
Can you bring up the lobby cameras for me please?

733
01:15:27,640 --> 01:15:28,860
Sure.

734
01:15:34,359 --> 01:15:37,219
Alright. Back that up five minutes.

735
01:15:37,220 --> 01:15:39,220
Okay.

736
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:46,199
Alright. Wait. Pause. Who's that?

737
01:15:47,100 --> 01:15:49,800
Can you enhance that resolution a little bit?

738
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:55,060
I can increase the contrast a little, but I can't add resolution that doesn't exist.

739
01:15:55,060 --> 01:15:57,740
Alright. Whatever. Just, do that.

740
01:15:58,539 --> 01:16:00,000
Okay.

741
01:16:02,659 --> 01:16:05,039
Okay. Do an image search on him.

742
01:16:10,979 --> 01:16:12,059
Damn it!

743
01:16:12,460 --> 01:16:15,480
That's the kid from the park. That's Stephenson.

744
01:16:16,619 --> 01:16:18,359
Go to Decimate's house.

745
01:16:18,359 --> 01:16:20,359
I don't know where he lives.

746
01:16:20,359 --> 01:16:22,359
Head north on 19th.

747
01:17:04,079 --> 01:17:05,619
Up early, Will?

748
01:17:05,619 --> 01:17:06,939
I need your help.

749
01:17:06,939 --> 01:17:08,519
Again?

750
01:17:08,520 --> 01:17:10,520
I'm in trouble.

751
01:17:11,020 --> 01:17:12,240
I warned you about that.

752
01:17:12,239 --> 01:17:14,239
I know. I get it, more than you know.

753
01:17:14,899 --> 01:17:17,420
I doubt that. But continue.

754
01:17:17,939 --> 01:17:19,699
We got Hash.

755
01:17:20,239 --> 01:17:22,599
Oh, don't tell me that.

756
01:17:22,600 --> 01:17:24,600
He's in the car.

757
01:17:25,479 --> 01:17:30,399
Whatever. Get inside before someone sees you. Douche bag.

758
01:17:35,680 --> 01:17:39,539
You brought him here? Will, this is bad.

759
01:17:39,539 --> 01:17:42,220
I know. We're going to get caught.

760
01:17:42,220 --> 01:17:44,280
And they're going to try and take me down with you.

761
01:17:44,279 --> 01:17:46,579
I'm sorry. But, I know what Shepherd is.

762
01:17:47,039 --> 01:17:48,680
So do I.

763
01:17:50,680 --> 01:17:52,300
I can't let it go.

764
01:17:53,100 --> 01:17:57,180
So, you went the way of the activist. Does this mean you're

765
01:17:57,180 --> 01:17:59,180
willing to accept the consequences?

766
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:01,579
They're going to come and get me.

767
01:18:01,579 --> 01:18:06,399
I'm not asking you to hide me. I'm asking for your help in taking them down.

768
01:18:06,399 --> 01:18:08,399
Shepherd is wrong.

769
01:18:10,859 --> 01:18:12,000
What are you doing here?

770
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:15,199
Does it matter? Will, what the hell have you done?

771
01:18:15,199 --> 01:18:17,300
What do you want this time?

772
01:18:18,220 --> 01:18:21,980
We need to take them down, or at least break them before they find us.

773
01:18:23,460 --> 01:18:28,060
You got Hash out, which I have to say, more than I thought you'd manage.

774
01:18:28,239 --> 01:18:33,319
But, attacking DHS and NSA? Will, it's crazy, even for me.

775
01:18:33,979 --> 01:18:40,539
We can't let them get away with this. I... I can't... I can't live with it.

776
01:18:40,539 --> 01:18:44,479
The NSA is a company mainly populated by people like me.

777
01:18:44,680 --> 01:18:46,360
You don't stand a chance.

778
01:18:46,359 --> 01:18:48,659
Then we notify the media.

779
01:18:48,659 --> 01:18:51,639
Haven't you ever heard the term "media conglomerate"?

780
01:18:51,640 --> 01:18:55,619
Damn it, Decimate. Don't you believe in anything!?

781
01:18:56,460 --> 01:19:01,819
Survival. And what you're talking about? Not how I do it.

782
01:19:01,819 --> 01:19:03,819
Information should be free.

783
01:19:03,819 --> 01:19:05,819
Don't be naive, Will.

784
01:19:05,819 --> 01:19:08,559
Nothing is changing.

785
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:13,539
You either play the game and thrive, or fight it and lose!

786
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:16,740
I don't lose.

787
01:19:20,760 --> 01:19:23,640
Will's right. We can't let them take him.

788
01:19:24,039 --> 01:19:28,819
Sure we can. In fact, it's probably the best option we've got right now.

789
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:34,240
Sometimes the best way to deal with a thing... is to go through it.

790
01:19:34,600 --> 01:19:36,100
I thought you were his friend?

791
01:19:36,100 --> 01:19:38,100
I am.

792
01:19:38,100 --> 01:19:43,660
After seeing you here though, I wonder if he feels the same way about you?

793
01:19:45,659 --> 01:19:48,819
I have a lot of work to do before sunrise, so...

794
01:19:49,939 --> 01:19:52,000
What happens at sunrise?

795
01:19:56,399 --> 01:20:01,719
Don't wake them. They're going to need what little rest they can get.

796
01:20:08,699 --> 01:20:11,239
When are you going to get some furniture?

797
01:20:13,239 --> 01:20:15,019
When I get around to it.

798
01:20:17,060 --> 01:20:23,940
Heat? Really? You are such a guy.

799
01:20:28,760 --> 01:20:30,659
Good morning, people!

800
01:20:31,100 --> 01:20:34,520
I've got some bad news.

801
01:20:35,319 --> 01:20:41,539
DHS is outside and they've come for Will and Hash and Sudonym.

802
01:20:42,399 --> 01:20:43,539
What?

803
01:20:47,399 --> 01:20:49,019
How did they find us?

804
01:20:49,560 --> 01:20:51,020
I turned you in.

805
01:20:52,659 --> 01:20:54,760
You mean, we're just going to knock?

806
01:20:54,760 --> 01:20:56,760
Those are the orders.

807
01:20:57,500 --> 01:20:59,899
That's not a lot of fun.

808
01:21:01,279 --> 01:21:05,639
I get that you're pissed. But, you're just gonna have to trust me.

809
01:21:05,640 --> 01:21:07,160
Why?

810
01:21:07,340 --> 01:21:08,619
Because I've got a plan.

811
01:21:08,619 --> 01:21:10,619
And if you're plan fails?

812
01:21:17,380 --> 01:21:20,239
Punctual. I like that.

813
01:21:21,239 --> 01:21:22,859
Where are they?

814
01:21:24,039 --> 01:21:27,479
It's alright. They're not going to do anything rough.

815
01:21:28,359 --> 01:21:29,839
That's part of the deal.

816
01:21:35,140 --> 01:21:36,700
Look, I don't trust you.

817
01:21:37,100 --> 01:21:39,400
That happens. Get up.

818
01:21:52,479 --> 01:21:55,179
I don't know who you are or who you're friends with.

819
01:21:55,260 --> 01:22:00,119
But, this could have been messy. You just made our job a lot easier. Let's go.

820
01:22:01,239 --> 01:22:05,420
Anything I can do to help. Have a nice rest of your day.

821
01:22:08,439 --> 01:22:11,599
Well that's done.

822
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:19,039
Words are about conveying ideas.

823
01:22:20,079 --> 01:22:25,340
The words "twenty days later" don't even begin to convey my experience.

824
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:32,239
Maybe Sudonym was right. Maybe I should have left it alone.

825
01:22:32,239 --> 01:22:35,939
Hey, it's Will, right? Let me get this off of you.

826
01:22:43,779 --> 01:22:48,800
I got some news for you, Will. You hear me? Hey.

827
01:22:51,159 --> 01:22:56,180
Now they're telling me... and I probably shouldn't even be here...

828
01:22:58,180 --> 01:23:01,260
but your friend... Charles?

829
01:23:03,340 --> 01:23:05,319
He didn't make it.

830
01:23:08,079 --> 01:23:10,739
I'm sorry that it has to come from me.

831
01:23:12,859 --> 01:23:15,279
They couldn't revive him.

832
01:23:17,939 --> 01:23:20,379
You know, I'm sorry.

833
01:23:26,579 --> 01:23:30,739
I don't know who I am anymore. Maybe that doesn't even matter.

834
01:23:43,500 --> 01:23:45,979
Call Timothy Elliot.

835
01:23:50,600 --> 01:23:52,539
You're up early.

836
01:23:52,539 --> 01:23:54,539
Late, actually.

837
01:23:56,939 --> 01:23:59,199
They've had Will for three weeks, now.

838
01:23:59,239 --> 01:24:04,039
I know. I just got the word: they're closing the facility in a week.

839
01:24:04,899 --> 01:24:07,179
Well, then it's time.

840
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:34,020
I could try to justify all of this to you but in the end it really doesn't matter.

841
01:24:39,579 --> 01:24:41,979
What you did is important, Will.

842
01:24:43,979 --> 01:24:48,939
It's a big deal. It's probably the biggest thing that you'll ever do.

843
01:24:56,939 --> 01:24:58,460
What do you want?

844
01:25:00,140 --> 01:25:04,340
I want you to work for us. What can you do.

845
01:25:09,779 --> 01:25:16,880
I'm a... I'm a hacker... a coder.

846
01:25:18,739 --> 01:25:23,779
That's what Timothy told us. You still feel up for it?

847
01:25:35,739 --> 01:25:38,679
What will you do with my code?

848
01:25:40,640 --> 01:25:45,000
Now, we could sit here and talk about the seemingly fluid nature of morality

849
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:48,720
and your particular take on it, but like I said, that doesn't really matter.

850
01:25:49,420 --> 01:25:54,779
I can get you out of here. I can get you doing work that you'll be proud of.

851
01:26:05,960 --> 01:26:07,760
How can I trust you?

852
01:26:09,899 --> 01:26:12,219
Take a leap of faith, Will.

853
01:26:17,100 --> 01:26:19,180
And my friends?

854
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,319
Friendly, would you come in here?

855
01:26:29,119 --> 01:26:33,579
Would you help Will to the car where his friends are waiting for him.

856
01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:37,880
Now Timothy told me your story, but I'd like to hear it from you.

857
01:26:37,880 --> 01:26:39,880
Okay, here we go.

858
01:26:39,880 --> 01:26:41,880
One, two, three...

859
01:26:47,180 --> 01:26:48,880
What are you talking about?

860
01:26:50,359 --> 01:26:52,599
Tell me whatever you think is relevant.

861
01:26:52,640 --> 01:26:54,200
And don't worry about the time.

862
01:26:54,260 --> 01:26:58,199
We've got a couple of hours before we have to get back to the office.

863
01:26:59,779 --> 01:27:05,599
Okay. This started about a month ago.

864
01:27:08,180 --> 01:27:12,079
A month ago... I was a god.
