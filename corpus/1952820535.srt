00:00:30,937 --> 00:00:34,075
#NOWHERE TO HIDE#

2
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:15,604
EMT security. We are reading
a security breach in the

3
00:02:15,605 --> 00:02:18,901
southeast corner of your building.
Please evacuate immediately.

4
00:02:19,741 --> 00:02:22,965
Kimmy. - Possible intruder alert.
The police are on their way.

5
00:02:46,288 --> 00:02:50,937
Mom… - We have to get out.
- What's going on? - Now.

6
00:02:52,267 --> 00:02:54,767
Let's go.

7
00:03:25,911 --> 00:03:29,694
Sarah! Kimmy!

8
00:03:38,396 --> 00:03:40,896
You're calling dad?

9
00:03:43,603 --> 00:03:45,892
That was weird.

10
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:49,967
Sarah! Kimmy!

11
00:03:51,069 --> 00:03:53,569
Sarah!

12
00:04:04,336 --> 00:04:09,116
Eddie? - Mrs. Crane, EMT security.
Unfortunately,it was a false alarm.

13
00:04:09,258 --> 00:04:11,618
The police have been called off and...
- What?

14
00:04:11,619 --> 00:04:13,993
We offer our sincerest
apologies and we'll do our best

15
00:04:13,994 --> 00:04:17,364
to make sure it never happens again. - You
have any idea what we just went through?

16
00:04:17,365 --> 00:04:20,438
I understand and I can credit
your account for one free month.

17
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:23,133
Well, gee, that would be great, thanks.

18
00:04:24,579 --> 00:04:26,870
Dad's new super duper
security system's tons of fun.

19
00:04:26,871 --> 00:04:29,371
Can we do this again tomorrow night?

20
00:04:33,336 --> 00:04:35,836
Hey, you there?

21
00:04:37,049 --> 00:04:39,549
Hey!

22
00:04:43,527 --> 00:04:46,419
Yeah, hon, Can you call
me when you get this?

23
00:04:46,746 --> 00:04:51,514
Kimmy and I just had a fun little
drama. And when you coming home?

24
00:04:51,904 --> 00:04:54,347
We've been getting a
little worried about you.

25
00:04:54,348 --> 00:04:56,848
All right, love you.

26
00:04:57,146 --> 00:05:01,092
So, where's dad? - You know how
he gets when he's working a case.

27
00:05:01,093 --> 00:05:03,593
He should be back soon.

28
00:05:08,313 --> 00:05:10,813
Who's “Studboy 69”?

29
00:05:11,103 --> 00:05:13,996
Mom.
- Sounds like a classy guy.

30
00:05:13,997 --> 00:05:16,497
He's just a friend.

31
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:21,541
Yeah, that's how they get you.
- Oh, is that how dad got you?

32
00:05:21,542 --> 00:05:24,933
Yeah. He was a little more
romantic. Not much but a little.

33
00:05:27,449 --> 00:05:29,696
Do you ever take that thing off?

34
00:05:29,697 --> 00:05:32,197
If it's too loud, you're too old.

35
00:05:35,793 --> 00:05:38,293
All right, no more
I.M.ing tonight, okay?

36
00:05:38,783 --> 00:05:42,835
Gotcha. No more randomly
storming out of the house, okay?

37
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:48,416
Gotcha. Oh, and this?

38
00:05:49,031 --> 00:05:51,531
Doesn't keep out as much
light as you think it does.

39
00:05:51,604 --> 00:05:54,610
Hey, it took you four hours
to catch me, detective.

40
00:05:54,797 --> 00:05:58,072
Ooh, and you're not as
clever as you think you are.

41
00:05:59,195 --> 00:06:02,911
Cops retire. Moms don't. Love you.

42
00:06:03,347 --> 00:06:05,847
You better.

43
00:06:11,328 --> 00:06:13,828
No more texting.

44
00:06:17,452 --> 00:06:20,870
Okay, we'll do this your
way, But if you hurt them...

45
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:23,584
It will be because
you chose to hurt them.

46
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:51,709
What the hell are you up to, Ed?

47
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:57,791
All right, take him to the warehouse. Wh...
where'd they go? Go out and find them.

48
00:06:57,875 --> 00:07:02,942
Shoot them if you must. Keep going, Keep
going. Throw it over the roof. There you go!

49
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:07,215
Somebody got a bazooka!

50
00:07:08,107 --> 00:07:11,107
What did you do with them, you
son of a bitch? Where are they?

51
00:07:11,351 --> 00:07:13,851
Who?
- Somebody just busted down the door

52
00:07:13,904 --> 00:07:17,320
across the street. The guy's got a gun.
- What's the address, sir?

53
00:07:17,321 --> 00:07:20,764
It's 3411 Marine
drive. You better hurry.

54
00:07:23,394 --> 00:07:27,501
Where are they? - I don't know. -
Tell me where they are! - I don't know!

55
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:32,292
Drop the gun, Eddie! - I can't.
- Drop it! - You don't understand.

56
00:07:32,293 --> 00:07:34,793
I don't care! Drop the gun!
- You don't understand.

57
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:37,456
This guy's got my family. He
said he's gonna kill my family

58
00:07:37,532 --> 00:07:41,179
with a push of his finger. - Family?
I've never seen you Before in my life.

59
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:46,181
Hey don’t touch that! Where are they?
- Hey, hey, Eddie! Eddie, it's me, Jack.

60
00:07:47,195 --> 00:07:49,910
Okay, just calm down. If
this guy is who you think

61
00:07:49,911 --> 00:07:52,732
he is we'll bring him in
together, all right? - No.

62
00:07:54,967 --> 00:07:59,929
Okay, look. Does he look like he's
in any position to hurt anyone?

63
00:08:06,671 --> 00:08:09,171
Okay.

64
00:08:10,082 --> 00:08:12,582
Team leader, we got 'em.
You want us to take 'em out

65
00:08:13,903 --> 00:08:16,403
No!

66
00:08:48,232 --> 00:08:50,816
Hello.
- Hello? Eddie?

67
00:08:50,817 --> 00:08:53,241
No. Sarah?

68
00:08:53,242 --> 00:08:57,432
Who is this?
- Sarah, it's Jack.

69
00:09:00,788 --> 00:09:03,288
Mom!

70
00:09:05,498 --> 00:09:07,998
Mom!

71
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:13,470
Mom?

72
00:09:33,846 --> 00:09:37,532
How you holding up, hon?
- I'm okay.

73
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:43,343
Look, I know no matter what I
say, it isn't gonna be enough,

74
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:47,325
but you gotta know that I'm always
gonna be here for you and Kimmy.

75
00:09:47,599 --> 00:09:50,735
Okay? Now, look, if
there's anything I can do,

76
00:09:50,823 --> 00:09:54,376
Anything, you've gotta promise
me that you'll call me, all right?

77
00:09:54,991 --> 00:09:59,012
Anything and anytime.
At home or the precinct.

78
00:10:00,347 --> 00:10:03,563
Come here. Come here, you.

79
00:10:35,428 --> 00:10:38,628
Hello, Sarah.
- What are you doing here?

80
00:10:38,629 --> 00:10:42,106
I... I usually don't deliver
these things personally,

81
00:10:42,189 --> 00:10:44,689
But I wanted to bring them myself.

82
00:10:46,324 --> 00:10:51,653
Two months I've been asking for
my husband's things. Two months.

83
00:10:52,677 --> 00:10:56,292
And then they send you to bring them?
- I volunteered.

84
00:10:57,693 --> 00:11:01,252
They don't release these things
until after the investigation.

85
00:11:01,368 --> 00:11:03,594
It's protocol. You remember.

86
00:11:03,595 --> 00:11:08,413
Protocol? So you're here
to tell me about protocol.

87
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,557
There was something happening with him,

88
00:11:12,261 --> 00:11:15,538
And I.A. may want to put this
whole thing to rest, but I can’t.

89
00:11:15,858 --> 00:11:20,600
Eddie wasn't a bad cop.
You of all people know that.

90
00:11:21,157 --> 00:11:25,977
I know what kind of man Ed was,
Sarah, But you should've seen the

91
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:30,360
look in his eye that night. There
was something going on with him.

92
00:11:34,212 --> 00:11:36,712
I hope that that brings
some kind of closure.

93
00:11:38,801 --> 00:11:44,553
Jack this isn't a gift from
you. This is my property.

94
00:11:45,373 --> 00:11:48,587
And right now, honestly, in
this moment, there is nothing

95
00:11:48,729 --> 00:11:51,383
that you can say that will
make any of this any better.

96
00:12:01,567 --> 00:12:06,182
Hey, who was at the door?
- No one.

97
00:12:08,747 --> 00:12:11,247
What's that?

98
00:12:15,621 --> 00:12:18,121
Okay, fine.

99
00:12:46,943 --> 00:12:49,443
Let's start over, sweetheart.

100
00:12:50,901 --> 00:12:53,401
How are you doing?

101
00:12:54,095 --> 00:12:58,906
I'm okay, But what about you? You
gonna leave the house at all today?

102
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,046
You gonna tomorrow? Maybe the next day?

103
00:13:04,955 --> 00:13:07,695
Maybe you should get out. I don't know.

104
00:13:08,682 --> 00:13:12,998
You can't stay in the house forever.
You're becoming kind of a shut in.

105
00:13:13,476 --> 00:13:15,863
No, I've just been...

106
00:13:15,864 --> 00:13:18,364
Been under self imposed house
arrest for the past two months?

107
00:13:19,698 --> 00:13:22,202
Seriously,people go nuts staying
cooped up inside too long.

108
00:13:24,714 --> 00:13:27,808
And you were never really that
together in the first place.

109
00:13:31,564 --> 00:13:34,238
Just promise me you won't get a million
cats and become the town cat lady.

110
00:13:36,282 --> 00:13:38,782
Okay. I promise.

111
00:13:42,195 --> 00:13:46,027
Maybe you could go to the store.
We sure could use some groceries.

112
00:13:46,962 --> 00:13:49,462
Yeah.

113
00:13:49,651 --> 00:13:52,151
Sunlight's not gonna
turn you to dust, Sarah.

114
00:13:53,741 --> 00:13:56,671
Mom. I'm your mom.

115
00:14:20,178 --> 00:14:23,175
#U THERE?
- ANY BETTER TODAY?#

116
00:14:23,599 --> 00:14:26,696
#STARTING TO FEEL INVISIBLE HERE.
- COME MEET ME. I'LL CHEER U UP#

117
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:21,650
Roadlink. I see you're
having some car troubles.

118
00:15:21,768 --> 00:15:24,966
Yeah, it just sort of...
- Stopped?

119
00:15:27,188 --> 00:15:33,013
Yeah, you guys are good. - Plus your entire
car is on our grid. Looking at my screen here,

120
00:15:33,089 --> 00:15:35,589
I'm seeing that there's some
trouble with the engine itself.

121
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:38,216
Looks like it's maybe the
fuel injector valve cover.

122
00:15:38,882 --> 00:15:41,824
It could've just popped off. If you
wanna take a look under the hood,

123
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:45,619
it's just this little seal that you can
screw back on with a twist of your fingers.

124
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:49,266
How far away's that gas station?
- Around two miles.

125
00:15:49,505 --> 00:15:52,005
Here,I'll pop the hood for you.

126
00:16:03,267 --> 00:16:05,767
How'd that go?
- We'll see.

127
00:16:09,423 --> 00:16:11,643
You're amazing.

128
00:16:11,644 --> 00:16:15,517
Come back for the 9.30 show. Is there
anything I can do for you, Ms. Crane?

129
00:16:15,616 --> 00:16:18,116
Mrs.
- Oh, all apologies.

130
00:16:18,282 --> 00:16:21,114
Is there anything else I
can do for you, Mrs.Crane?

131
00:16:21,269 --> 00:16:26,103
Can you carry groceries? - Have a
good day, Mrs. Crane. - Thank you.

132
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,634
Hello? Kimmy?

133
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:41,410
A little help here.

134
00:16:41,553 --> 00:16:44,053
Got more groceries In the car.

135
00:16:47,448 --> 00:16:49,948
Kimmy?

136
00:16:54,564 --> 00:16:58,504
All right, If you see her, Just
have her call home, okay? Thanks.

137
00:17:35,653 --> 00:17:38,153
Voicemail. Figure it out, genius.

138
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:43,230
If you didn't get my 20 other messages...
- Message box is full. Please try again later.

139
00:17:45,395 --> 00:17:47,902
Roadlink, How may I help you?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

140
00:17:47,966 --> 00:17:51,201
I must've hit the button by mistake.
- No worries, Ms. Crane.

141
00:17:51,581 --> 00:17:53,849
I see you've recently
filled up and added oil.

142
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:56,814
You won't need me if you keep doing that...
- Mrs. Crane.

143
00:17:56,869 --> 00:18:01,231
And I'm sorry I hit the button by mistake.
I don't need any help but thank you.

144
00:18:01,232 --> 00:18:04,356
That's okay because you don't
really need to hit the button.

145
00:18:04,624 --> 00:18:07,120
We can hear you at all
times. The button's just sort

146
00:18:07,121 --> 00:18:10,997
of for client piece of mind.
It's something they don't tell you

147
00:18:11,045 --> 00:18:15,049
in the brochure. - How do
I turn it off? - You don't.

148
00:18:16,912 --> 00:18:20,151
Can I speak to your supervisor?
- I am the supervisor.

149
00:18:20,234 --> 00:18:22,999
Look...
- No. This isn't a looking game.

150
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:26,295
This is a listening game. You understand?
- What?

151
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:30,186
You are a good mom. You were
a good cop at one point, too.

152
00:18:30,832 --> 00:18:36,695
Who is this? - Let's explore who you are,
Sarah Crane. Formerly Sarah Erickson,

153
00:18:37,584 --> 00:18:40,163
Graduated top of her academy
class, Three years service,

154
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:43,025
Then mysteriously, you
drop off the map. Why?

155
00:18:43,913 --> 00:18:46,413
Left to start a family was
the story everyone heard.

156
00:18:46,633 --> 00:18:51,391
Who the hell are you?
- I'm the guy who has your daughter,

157
00:18:52,784 --> 00:18:56,253
and I'm the guy who's gonnakill your
daughter, if, and this is a big if,

158
00:18:58,538 --> 00:19:01,540
you don't do exactly what I say.

159
00:19:17,558 --> 00:19:21,644
Hey! Hey, let me out of here!

160
00:19:24,803 --> 00:19:27,015
Somebody help me!

161
00:19:27,016 --> 00:19:29,516
What the hell have you
done with my daughter?

162
00:19:29,743 --> 00:19:32,243
What am I about to do, you mean?

163
00:19:34,933 --> 00:19:39,516
Don't you touch her. - That's wholly
up to you, Ms. Crane. - If you hurt her…

164
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:42,080
...it will be because
you chose to hurt her.

165
00:19:42,287 --> 00:19:47,823
Now are you ready to listen?
Take your time. Take your time.

166
00:19:47,868 --> 00:19:52,530
I want you to think about this.
- How do I know you even have her?

167
00:19:55,458 --> 00:20:01,813
Let me out! Somebody please let me out!

168
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:04,599
Sarah, pull us back on the road.

169
00:20:06,114 --> 00:20:08,547
Please!

170
00:20:08,548 --> 00:20:11,121
Somebody, let me out!

171
00:20:13,973 --> 00:20:16,575
Sarah, it's completely natural for
you to want to protect your daughter.

172
00:20:16,615 --> 00:20:19,940
Any parent who wouldn't shouldn't
be a parent in the first place,

173
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:25,318
but sometimes protecting them...
Means doing what you're told. Sarah?

174
00:20:27,029 --> 00:20:30,741
Sarah? Are you there?

175
00:20:32,873 --> 00:20:35,265
911 what's your
emergency? - Hello? Listen.

176
00:20:35,266 --> 00:20:38,113
There's a man who has
kidnapped my daughter.

177
00:20:38,664 --> 00:20:43,049
He's using Roadlink to talk to me.
I'm gonna leave the phone on so maybe

178
00:20:43,092 --> 00:20:45,592
you can track the call or...

179
00:20:45,935 --> 00:20:49,615
You can whisper all you want,Sarah.
It's not bringing your daughter home.

180
00:20:52,588 --> 00:20:55,151
Oh, Sarah, if we're gonna
work together, we're gonna need

181
00:20:55,204 --> 00:20:59,894
to learn how to trust each other...
because when you think about it,

182
00:20:59,972 --> 00:21:04,764
in life, that's really all
we have it's what separates...

183
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:13,945
Thought I lost you. Now where were we?

184
00:21:14,112 --> 00:21:16,612
Look, I know a little bit
about these situations.

185
00:21:16,806 --> 00:21:19,674
I need to know that you have
her and that she is all right.

186
00:21:20,416 --> 00:21:23,872
Oh, come on. Sarah, do
you honestly think...

187
00:21:29,153 --> 00:21:31,653
Hey!

188
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:05,720
Stop! stop!

189
00:22:07,656 --> 00:22:10,156
Stop!

190
00:22:22,294 --> 00:22:24,794
Are you there? Hello?

191
00:22:27,209 --> 00:22:31,904
Hello, are you there? I was in a tunnel.
- Aren't we all?

192
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:37,737
I must admit, Sarah, It was very
frustrating watching everyone

193
00:22:37,889 --> 00:22:40,879
turn their backs on you like that.
They immediately assumed the worst

194
00:22:40,962 --> 00:22:44,809
about you. God, I hate this city.

195
00:22:48,248 --> 00:22:50,608
Turn right up here on Buena Vista.

196
00:22:50,609 --> 00:22:54,769
No bridges, No problems. We're not
going to be going through that again.

197
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:59,183
Sarah, I’ve been patient with you so far,
but if you try another stunt like that again,

198
00:22:59,184 --> 00:23:02,696
you'll be shopping for a dress to
bury your daughter in, understood?

199
00:23:03,248 --> 00:23:05,764
Yes. Just tell me what you want.

200
00:23:06,903 --> 00:23:10,776
Of course. You are to find
and deliver to me a man

201
00:23:10,838 --> 00:23:15,210
named Paulo Farina. He's not someone
I've been able to find in the online

202
00:23:15,273 --> 00:23:19,818
white pages, if you understand what
I mean. He's slipped off the grid,

203
00:23:20,099 --> 00:23:22,391
Which is why I need mommy
detective to give me access

204
00:23:22,392 --> 00:23:26,034
to something I don't have access
to. - You seem pretty resourceful.

205
00:23:26,183 --> 00:23:31,728
What don't you have access to?
- It's funny but the police are

206
00:23:31,804 --> 00:23:34,304
very secretive about
protecting their information.

207
00:23:34,978 --> 00:23:38,620
You have the skills and connections
to get me what I want. 14 years ago,

208
00:23:38,717 --> 00:23:41,390
you could find people
that no one else could.

209
00:23:42,339 --> 00:23:47,284
So it's time to go back to work. Time to
get back piece of yourself that you gave up.

210
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:50,521
That will feel pretty good, I'll bet.

211
00:23:51,139 --> 00:23:53,639
Why do I get the feeling
you've done this before?

212
00:23:54,006 --> 00:23:56,875
You know, your husband
wouldn'tlisten either, and,

213
00:23:58,986 --> 00:24:01,486
look where it got him.

214
00:24:01,886 --> 00:24:05,132
What do you know about my husband?
- As it turns out, a great deal.

215
00:24:06,172 --> 00:24:10,443
He didn't have what it takes, And
Sarah, all it takes is listening.

216
00:24:11,499 --> 00:24:16,868
Remember? Either you love
your daughter, Or you don't.

217
00:24:18,143 --> 00:24:20,528
You answer that question by
giving me what I want, Understood?

218
00:24:20,529 --> 00:24:24,611
Don't threaten my daughter.
I am a cop. With cop friends.

219
00:24:24,703 --> 00:24:30,232
There is no way...
- No. No. You're a housewife

220
00:24:30,865 --> 00:24:33,283
with a dead husband and
possibly a dead daughter.

221
00:24:33,284 --> 00:24:36,405
I can find people all right, Do you
understand me? And I can find you.

222
00:24:36,467 --> 00:24:39,332
Do you think you have friends?
Do you think you have friends?

223
00:24:40,682 --> 00:24:43,182
A quick experiment.

224
00:24:44,216 --> 00:24:46,579
Dispatch.
- Hi, this is Roadlink.

225
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:49,080
I have a client who's reporting
she needs some roadside assistance.

226
00:24:49,721 --> 00:24:53,682
She sounds pretty desperate.
- Location and license plate?

227
00:24:54,259 --> 00:24:58,731
She's in the 1400 block Of
Maple. 144.2 Degrees longitude,

228
00:24:59,493 --> 00:25:03,319
97 Degrees latitude.
- We have an officer in the area.

229
00:25:04,914 --> 00:25:10,693
California license plate PCI 140.
- An officer has been dispatched.

230
00:25:11,732 --> 00:25:14,956
Great, thanks so much.
- What are you doing?

231
00:25:15,538 --> 00:25:18,582
What did they teach you in the
academy, Sarah? I over E, right?

232
00:25:18,674 --> 00:25:22,251
Intellect over emotion? The
cop over the mother? Come on,

233
00:25:23,282 --> 00:25:27,473
you know how kidnappings turn
out, Sarah. Use your I over your E.

234
00:25:27,724 --> 00:25:30,224
Go to hell!
- Emotions.

235
00:25:30,426 --> 00:25:33,860
Your "E" motions would tell
you, "have the authorities trace

236
00:25:33,932 --> 00:25:36,605
the whack job's computer and they
arrest him," But your intellect...

237
00:25:38,187 --> 00:25:43,370
your intellect says, "if I do that,
my daughter will suffer horribly,

238
00:25:43,415 --> 00:25:45,915
and I’ll never see her again."

239
00:25:47,211 --> 00:25:49,711
Oh, you might want to pull over.

240
00:26:00,781 --> 00:26:03,639
So really, it's what Part of the
equation do you lean toward, Sarah?

241
00:26:03,941 --> 00:26:06,565
I over E or E over I?

242
00:26:07,857 --> 00:26:10,357
You might want to check that message.

243
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:28,432
E says tell the cop. I says don't.

244
00:26:28,467 --> 00:26:30,743
Both of them are screaming
at you that your daughter's

245
00:26:30,744 --> 00:26:35,557
probably gonna die
anyway, but... maybe not.

246
00:26:40,068 --> 00:26:44,107
And Sarah, I think this goes without
saying, if you say anything to cop,

247
00:26:44,632 --> 00:26:49,534
or set one foot outside the car,
I'm afraid I'll have to kill her.

248
00:26:57,162 --> 00:26:59,467
Afternoon, ma'am. We
got a roadlink report

249
00:26:59,468 --> 00:27:02,308
about you being in a little bit of
trouble, Need some police assistance?

250
00:27:02,808 --> 00:27:08,280
No, that was a mistake.
There's no emergency anymore.

251
00:27:10,303 --> 00:27:13,284
Anymore? So there was an emergency?

252
00:27:13,918 --> 00:27:16,418
No, not exactly.

253
00:27:19,488 --> 00:27:21,988
You all right, ma'am?

254
00:27:24,154 --> 00:27:30,215
Yeah. There was this black
Cadillac, And it was tailgating me.

255
00:27:30,299 --> 00:27:34,404
Well, I thought it was following me.
It seemed like it was following me.

256
00:27:34,463 --> 00:27:38,928
I guess I just got a little nervous. - I'm gonna
have to ask you to step out of the car, ma'am.

257
00:27:38,929 --> 00:27:41,276
For what?
- Standard procedure.

258
00:27:41,277 --> 00:27:46,826
Oh, I know procedure. - I asked you
to step out of the car. - Please.

259
00:27:49,798 --> 00:27:52,298
You been drinking, ma'am?
- No.

260
00:27:52,727 --> 00:27:55,227
Step out of the car.

261
00:27:57,025 --> 00:28:00,603
I'm a cop. I was. Precinct 13.

262
00:28:01,063 --> 00:28:05,360
My husband is, was Edward Crane.

263
00:28:06,251 --> 00:28:11,059
I guess I was just overreacting when I called
it in. It's been a bit of a readjustment.

264
00:28:13,747 --> 00:28:16,247
I heard about what
happened to your husband.

265
00:28:16,878 --> 00:28:19,430
Some of the guys in my unit,
they used to work with him.

266
00:28:20,953 --> 00:28:23,801
Said he was a good man.
- The best.

267
00:28:26,899 --> 00:28:30,470
You're sure there's nothing wrong?
- I'm sorry for the confusion.

268
00:28:30,555 --> 00:28:33,677
I guess I'm just a little
bit on edge, you know?

269
00:28:36,908 --> 00:28:39,408
All right, well, if
there's anything else...

270
00:28:41,196 --> 00:28:43,696
you're in good hands.

271
00:28:43,818 --> 00:28:46,495
Thanks. - Have a good
afternoon, Ms. Crane.

272
00:28:56,199 --> 00:28:58,699
Well done, Ms. Crane.

273
00:29:31,733 --> 00:29:34,632
Say, Sarah. Why did you
Roll your window down?

274
00:29:38,734 --> 00:29:41,234
You really wanna see
what I can do, don't you?

275
00:30:09,425 --> 00:30:13,931
Sarah, quick question. Do you know how
many millions of cars have Roadlink in them?

276
00:30:15,275 --> 00:30:17,775
I don't know. How many?

277
00:30:19,953 --> 00:30:22,453
Really, it only takes one.

278
00:30:36,151 --> 00:30:39,077
#MAN ON ROADLINK KIDNAPPED
MY DAUGHTER#

279
00:30:56,939 --> 00:30:59,439
Sarah. You have work to do.

280
00:31:01,062 --> 00:31:04,262
I can't leave the scene of an accident.
- I think you have more pressing obligations.

281
00:31:04,431 --> 00:31:06,816
Don't you?

282
00:31:07,739 --> 00:31:09,989
Sarah,
What are you doing?

283
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:12,519
I am getting help for that
officer. I will be back in seconds.

284
00:31:12,596 --> 00:31:17,063
Don't touch my daughter.
- No, no, Sarah, Sarah. Sarah!

285
00:31:20,923 --> 00:31:24,709
You okay? It's gonna be okay.
Stay with me. Stay with me.

286
00:31:24,892 --> 00:31:28,214
It's gonna be okay.
Dispatch, Officer down, copy?

287
00:31:28,572 --> 00:31:32,507
Roger that. What's your 20?
- I 394 westbound

288
00:31:32,597 --> 00:31:35,989
near the Clearwater Bridge.
Request immediate assistance, copy?

289
00:31:36,489 --> 00:31:39,780
Emergency service has beendispatched.
Ma'am, what's your name?

290
00:31:40,731 --> 00:31:44,942
Ma'am? - Help me. - Are
you in any danger, ma'am?

291
00:31:44,943 --> 00:31:48,740
I'm sorry. - Ma'am, do you need any
help? Ma'am, are you there?

292
00:31:49,751 --> 00:31:52,251
Oh, are you okay?

293
00:31:59,658 --> 00:32:02,438
Ms. Crane, you have now seen what
I can do when I'm not even there.

294
00:32:02,643 --> 00:32:07,096
Need I remind you your daughter
is in the very next room.

295
00:32:07,866 --> 00:32:10,366
Put your car in D and
pull back onto the road.

296
00:32:22,073 --> 00:32:24,632
Sarah, don't feel bad about
that cop back there. Technically,

297
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:29,222
technically, that wasn't your fault.

298
00:32:29,842 --> 00:32:34,502
So this guy Farina, What, did he
steal Dungeons and Dragons cards?

299
00:32:35,455 --> 00:32:37,955
Questions make you feel
In control, don't they?

300
00:32:39,001 --> 00:32:42,201
I've had a question I've been meaning
to ask you. When you found out that

301
00:32:42,272 --> 00:32:47,047
daughter was missing, did it
bring up any of those bad memories?

302
00:32:48,728 --> 00:32:53,287
I don't know what you're
talking about. - Come on, Sarah.

303
00:32:53,288 --> 00:32:55,730
Your last case, remember?

304
00:32:56,646 --> 00:33:00,084
That greasy perv who nabbed
that kid from the playground.

305
00:33:01,067 --> 00:33:03,992
You must've really been in over
your head for him just to...

306
00:33:05,914 --> 00:33:11,718
kill her right in front of you. Just
like that. - What do you want?

307
00:33:13,784 --> 00:33:17,151
Forgive me. I have one more question,
And tell me if I'm be too personal.

308
00:33:17,964 --> 00:33:21,249
Did you think that having a
kid of your own would make up

309
00:33:21,312 --> 00:33:25,772
for the one that you lost? Because I
don't think the karma works that way.

310
00:33:28,234 --> 00:33:31,034
So this guy Farina.
What have you got on him?

311
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:34,468
Yes.

312
00:33:36,067 --> 00:33:41,174
Paulo Farina Is in police
protection before he testifies as to

313
00:33:41,252 --> 00:33:43,752
the nature of our crime.
Secret witnesses in

314
00:33:43,772 --> 00:33:46,487
secret locations, and
files on internal police

315
00:33:46,544 --> 00:33:49,044
networks mean that I
don't have access to him.

316
00:33:49,577 --> 00:33:53,865
You have access to
those files. Get them.

317
00:34:14,544 --> 00:34:17,044
Can you zoom in a bit more?

318
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:20,665
Zoom in on her hand.

319
00:34:20,666 --> 00:34:24,569
Little more. Right there.
What is she passing him?

320
00:35:04,243 --> 00:35:08,640
So who's Detective Irons?
- I don't know. So where am I going?

321
00:35:10,708 --> 00:35:14,081
You don't know your husband's ex
partner? The man who shot and killed

322
00:35:14,144 --> 00:35:16,736
him and then showed up on
your doorstep this morning.

323
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:23,690
Tell me, did you wanna hurt him? I
think even I would've to hurt him.

324
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,768
So what are you gonna do with
Farina when I bring him to you?

325
00:35:27,769 --> 00:35:30,347
I'm going to give you
your daughter back.

326
00:35:36,107 --> 00:35:39,211
Traffic seems ligh en route to your
destination. You have 19 minutes

327
00:35:39,821 --> 00:35:45,144
to get me what I want, and get back in the
car. You're on the clock now. My clock.

328
00:35:46,939 --> 00:35:49,439
Let's begin.

329
00:36:19,682 --> 00:36:21,961
Dispatch.
- This is Detective Irons.

330
00:36:21,962 --> 00:36:24,462
Could you put me through to the
Roadlink corporate Office, please?

331
00:37:14,428 --> 00:37:19,595
Sarah, what are you doing
here? - I really need your help.

332
00:37:20,171 --> 00:37:25,423
What's wrong, hon? - It's
Kimmy. She's missing.

333
00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:28,939
She wentout to meet some guy on
the internet, And I can't find her.

334
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:33,248
So do you know who the creep is?
- Yeah. Well, maybe.

335
00:37:35,256 --> 00:37:38,131
See, that's why I'm here. I just need
to dig on the department database.

336
00:37:38,624 --> 00:37:41,311
Just to make sure.
- Yeah, well, you give me his stats.

337
00:37:41,414 --> 00:37:43,914
Believe me, I'll find
that cretin's records.

338
00:37:44,555 --> 00:37:50,381
Priscilla. It would be better
if you didn't get too involved.

339
00:37:52,049 --> 00:37:54,549
What's going on?

340
00:37:55,545 --> 00:37:58,045
Sar?

341
00:37:58,515 --> 00:38:04,415
I just need to look the database
alone. I don't have much time.

342
00:38:05,228 --> 00:38:07,728
Until what?

343
00:38:11,723 --> 00:38:14,110
Priscilla, you know
me better than anyone.

344
00:38:14,111 --> 00:38:16,870
And I wouldn't ask you if
I didn't really need it.

345
00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:29,770
So I'm gonna step away for a minute.

346
00:38:31,202 --> 00:38:35,404
So if you wanna wait here,
I'll be back in a few minutes.

347
00:39:40,353 --> 00:39:45,872
Come on, come on.
- Oh, officer, there's a lady...

348
00:39:47,355 --> 00:39:49,910
#WITNESS FARINA PAULO
PROTECTIVE CUSTODY - CLASS B#

349
00:40:03,694 --> 00:40:06,194
What?

350
00:40:07,501 --> 00:40:11,131
Hey. Hey! Where are you?

351
00:40:47,463 --> 00:40:51,678
Open it! - Okay, "A" I'm the only
one with the keys to that door,

352
00:40:51,679 --> 00:40:54,726
and "B"... I guess you
don't really need to know "B"

353
00:40:54,727 --> 00:40:57,182
if you already know "A" right?
- Open it! Where are the keys?

354
00:40:57,183 --> 00:41:00,573
Okay, Kimmy, Yes, you have the
gun. The thing about guns is,

355
00:41:00,707 --> 00:41:03,817
no matter what side you're
on, it's always the wrong one.

356
00:41:04,432 --> 00:41:07,701
Open the door!
- Kimmy!

357
00:41:07,702 --> 00:41:11,791
Mom? What are you doing, you freak?

358
00:41:12,066 --> 00:41:15,957
We're both here, Ms. Crane.
- Farina is at the Aldergrove Motel.

359
00:41:15,958 --> 00:41:18,764
Now, take that info and
give me back my daughter.

360
00:41:20,048 --> 00:41:24,667
Open the door! - Kimmy, if evolution's
right, man will lose all of his limbs

361
00:41:24,739 --> 00:41:27,239
except for the push button finger.

362
00:41:29,007 --> 00:41:31,507
I'm gonna have to require that
you put the gun down now, Kimmy.

363
00:41:32,119 --> 00:41:36,532
Don't. Kimmy, shoot him.
Kimmy, just shoot him!

364
00:41:37,090 --> 00:41:40,163
She's not like you, Sarah.
Takes a lot to pull a trigger.

365
00:41:40,725 --> 00:41:43,225
You have to shoot him!

366
00:41:52,711 --> 00:41:55,211
So you were like your mother, after all.

367
00:41:57,895 --> 00:42:00,395
That's good to know.

368
00:42:04,194 --> 00:42:06,694
Okay, now I’m gonna have to ask
that you put down the glass, Kimmy.

369
00:42:08,731 --> 00:42:11,231
You do
not want to see what this button does.

370
00:42:11,929 --> 00:42:14,429
I don't care!
- I don't care?

371
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:18,980
The three most dangerous
words in the world.

372
00:42:32,519 --> 00:42:35,655
What are you doing?
- Turn it back on!

373
00:42:40,969 --> 00:42:44,405
Go, go, go, Sarah? Cars
are made to go, not to stop.

374
00:42:52,232 --> 00:42:55,572
Stop it! - Come on, Kimmy.
Turn your mommy's brakes back on.

375
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:58,073
Run, Kimmy! Get out of there!

376
00:43:06,774 --> 00:43:11,057
Fine, fine, okay.
- No! no!

377
00:43:11,830 --> 00:43:14,330
Put this on.

378
00:43:20,065 --> 00:43:22,565
Start the car.
- That is wholly up to you.

379
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:39,140
Done!
- Okay, now your wrists.

380
00:44:11,250 --> 00:44:13,750
I can't tighten these.
- Use your teeth.

381
00:44:21,274 --> 00:44:23,774
Start the car!
- Okay.

382
00:44:44,226 --> 00:44:46,726
We're all doing fine
here, Ms. Crane, just fine.

383
00:44:48,474 --> 00:44:51,451
Aldergrove motel. 16 miles
away. You have 37 minutes

384
00:44:51,548 --> 00:44:54,836
to get Farina back
into your custody. Go.

385
00:45:00,303 --> 00:45:02,803
Is it a crime that my best
friend came to visit me?

386
00:45:04,030 --> 00:45:09,073
She's in trouble, Priscilla. Help me
help her. Just tell what she wanted.

387
00:45:10,596 --> 00:45:13,096
What's she gotten into?

388
00:45:13,374 --> 00:45:17,426
I don't know, but she's acting a
hell of a lot like Ed did that night.

389
00:45:18,507 --> 00:45:21,007
You have to promise
that you'll protect her.

390
00:45:21,206 --> 00:45:27,198
I can't promis a thing. If she'dirty,
we both know what has to be done.

391
00:45:33,052 --> 00:45:35,552
Right there, right there.

392
00:45:37,014 --> 00:45:39,514
Wait a second. Farina?!

393
00:46:50,581 --> 00:46:55,298
Yes? - Yeah, officer, Looks like somebody
smashed out your car window.

394
00:46:56,897 --> 00:47:01,413
You must have the wrong room.
- Oh, okay. I didn't know

395
00:47:01,515 --> 00:47:03,787
if you had anything important in
there that could've gotten stolen.

396
00:47:04,948 --> 00:47:07,431
I'm sorry. You got the wrong room.

397
00:47:07,432 --> 00:47:10,326
Okay. Just didn't want
you to get in trouble.

398
00:47:28,065 --> 00:47:30,565
Sorry, newbie, I don't have time.

399
00:47:34,736 --> 00:47:37,236
Farina! Open the door!

400
00:47:37,557 --> 00:47:40,057
I've been sent to deliver you
and whoever it is wants you bad.

401
00:47:40,162 --> 00:47:43,945
He'll kill me. - Who's he?
- You don't know Wilkes?

402
00:47:45,067 --> 00:47:47,240
Not yet.
- Where is he?

403
00:47:47,275 --> 00:47:49,705
He's not here.
- He's everywhere!

404
00:47:49,706 --> 00:47:53,029
He's not stop, and I am notgonna
let a bathroom door stop me either.

405
00:47:53,379 --> 00:47:55,879
Step aside.

406
00:47:55,915 --> 00:47:58,839
Okay, okay. He'll kill me.

407
00:47:59,391 --> 00:48:01,674
He'll kill my daughter.

408
00:48:01,675 --> 00:48:04,637
Look, what do you wanna
know? I'll tell you anything.

409
00:48:05,636 --> 00:48:09,353
We all worked together on some
stuff. - But? - But I got to know

410
00:48:09,354 --> 00:48:12,798
a little too much about him. He
doesn't like that. And now I'm...

411
00:48:12,883 --> 00:48:16,266
Evidence. He's erasing
all of his evidence.

412
00:48:26,655 --> 00:48:29,370
Priscilla, I need one more favor.

413
00:48:34,803 --> 00:48:37,303
Let's go. Now!

414
00:49:06,007 --> 00:49:08,507
Get in.

415
00:49:31,475 --> 00:49:34,554
This is Irons. I have an
officer down. I need assistance.

416
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:48,353
How are you, Paulo? Cat got your tongue?

417
00:49:50,727 --> 00:49:53,227
Say something.

418
00:49:54,477 --> 00:49:57,717
I'm sorry. You know, about all this.

419
00:49:57,752 --> 00:50:00,063
You're a tough man to find when
you quit accessing your bank

420
00:50:00,064 --> 00:50:05,658
and credit cards, Paulo. And Sarah,
you've created quite a stir already.

421
00:50:06,515 --> 00:50:11,291
Word on the police band is you've gotten a
gun from one of our city's finest. That's good.

422
00:50:11,354 --> 00:50:13,854
That'll come in handy.
- So where do I bring him, Wilkes?

423
00:50:15,470 --> 00:50:17,970
I see you're still
quite the talker, Paulo.

424
00:50:19,534 --> 00:50:23,030
Sarah, there is a junkyard on
Portland street on the East end.

425
00:50:23,113 --> 00:50:26,564
There's a surveillance camera.
You're to bring Paulo there.

426
00:50:27,375 --> 00:50:29,875
Bring the gun.

427
00:50:35,452 --> 00:50:39,841
Kim will be there?
- Trade for trade.

428
00:50:39,842 --> 00:50:43,490
Please. I got kids.
- So do I.

429
00:50:58,165 --> 00:51:02,168
Hello? Can anyone hear me?

430
00:51:05,357 --> 00:51:07,857
Hello? Help!

431
00:51:15,884 --> 00:51:18,494
You handing me over is
just like you killing me.

432
00:51:19,475 --> 00:51:21,975
You might as well pull
that trigger right now.

433
00:51:47,672 --> 00:51:53,164
Sarah. Why don't we work
this out? I can get you money.

434
00:51:54,296 --> 00:51:56,796
Would you take money for your kid?

435
00:52:09,260 --> 00:52:12,101
Sarah, What the hell
happened? Where's Farina?

436
00:52:13,209 --> 00:52:15,709
Farina!
- Sarah!

437
00:52:21,273 --> 00:52:23,773
Farina!

438
00:52:24,890 --> 00:52:27,390
Farina!

439
00:53:02,506 --> 00:53:05,881
Toley's. - Hello, this is Officer Colin
Bailey with the LAPD.

440
00:53:06,381 --> 00:53:10,823
Well, how can I help you? - Sir, we have
an APB out on an escaped female prisoner.

441
00:53:11,213 --> 00:53:13,425
She may be making her way towards you.

442
00:53:13,426 --> 00:53:16,211
She may be trying to use
your phone or steal a car.

443
00:53:16,782 --> 00:53:21,315
Well, is she dangerous?
- Well, I would lock my doors if I were you.

444
00:53:21,332 --> 00:53:23,986
She shot two officers already
and she has nothing to lose.

445
00:53:28,174 --> 00:53:30,674
Farina!

446
00:53:54,087 --> 00:53:56,587
Farina!

447
00:54:03,207 --> 00:54:05,707
Farina!

448
00:54:08,022 --> 00:54:10,870
Come on, Farina. I'm
not gonna turn you in.

449
00:54:11,639 --> 00:54:15,692
I'm just playing along until I can
figure out a way to find this guy.

450
00:54:20,523 --> 00:54:23,023
Come on. I know you're here.

451
00:54:33,859 --> 00:54:36,227
Come on, Farina.

452
00:54:36,228 --> 00:54:38,728
Relax, I'm not...

453
00:54:39,818 --> 00:54:43,362
Don't move.
- I'm a cop.

454
00:54:43,871 --> 00:54:46,664
Yeah, sure you are. Back up, cop killer.

455
00:54:48,149 --> 00:54:50,803
Let me explain.
- Back up and turn around.

456
00:54:56,783 --> 00:54:59,977
I got the call. The run is over.

457
00:55:00,860 --> 00:55:05,240
What call? - I ain't letting no cop
killing escaped convict handle no gun so...

458
00:55:05,241 --> 00:55:08,400
so I'll take it. It's mine anyway.

459
00:55:09,008 --> 00:55:11,653
I was transporting
her And she jumped me.

460
00:55:12,459 --> 00:55:14,858
He's lying.
- You're a cop?

461
00:55:14,859 --> 00:55:19,448
Transport officer.
- Listen to me. He's lying. He's the felon.

462
00:55:19,541 --> 00:55:22,041
Hey!

463
00:55:27,741 --> 00:55:30,241
He's not taking my gun.

464
00:55:31,992 --> 00:55:34,492
No!

465
00:55:43,346 --> 00:55:46,063
Farina, don’t do this.
- I ain't going!

466
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:31,460
You just killed my daughter.

467
00:56:33,584 --> 00:56:36,084
Sarah? Sarah?

468
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:38,600
Sarah? Sarah!

469
00:56:42,793 --> 00:56:45,783
All units, We have a report of
gunfire off Robertson Canyon.

470
00:56:54,404 --> 00:56:57,123
Sarah?
- Pris? It's me.

471
00:56:57,898 --> 00:57:00,398
What the heck is going
on with you? Are you okay?

472
00:57:01,061 --> 00:57:04,055
Things aren't so good. I
don't have a whole lot of time.

473
00:57:04,509 --> 00:57:06,985
Sarah, you gotta watch your
back. There's a lot of people

474
00:57:06,986 --> 00:57:09,571
coming down on you right now.
- All right, did you find anything out?

475
00:57:09,757 --> 00:57:12,257
Well, it's bizarre.
- Well, talk quick.

476
00:57:12,501 --> 00:57:15,314
Raymond Wilkes' newborn
son and wife Disappear off

477
00:57:15,370 --> 00:57:19,631
The face of the earth In the mid 70's. - Well,
then, that's not the Wilkes I'm looking for.

478
00:57:19,632 --> 00:57:22,987
Then one day a six year old kid is
found wandering the neighborhood.

479
00:57:23,306 --> 00:57:25,667
He tells a neighbor he's been
trying to wake up his mom,

480
00:57:25,668 --> 00:57:29,398
but she started to smell funny
So he went to get help for her.

481
00:57:29,773 --> 00:57:33,308
So the cops go back to Wilkes' house
to find the mom deader than dead

482
00:57:33,396 --> 00:57:35,896
and the father hanging
by a rope in the garage.

483
00:57:35,969 --> 00:57:39,713
Now, fantastic guy that he was, he
had built a little prison inbasement.

484
00:57:40,174 --> 00:57:42,779
Kept them both down there right
after the little guy was born.

485
00:57:43,252 --> 00:57:46,019
Then little Sheldon Wilkes
became the property of the state,

486
00:57:46,087 --> 00:57:49,371
And moved from home to home, never
adjusted to being around people.

487
00:57:50,102 --> 00:57:54,061
Poor kid. - Yeah, I wouldn't feel too
sorry for him. What else?

488
00:57:54,441 --> 00:57:57,760
Well, and then all records just
stop when the kid's 18 like he was...

489
00:57:57,939 --> 00:58:02,174
Christ!
- Where are you? Sarah?

490
00:58:03,795 --> 00:58:07,661
Sarah? Sarah? Sarah?

491
00:58:26,235 --> 00:58:29,168
Sarah? Sarah? Sarah!

492
00:58:30,344 --> 00:58:32,844
Don't do this!

493
00:58:33,114 --> 00:58:38,785
Wilkes, I'm here. - What the hell happened?
Where's Farina? I heard gunshots.

494
00:58:39,185 --> 00:58:41,497
He's in the backseat. Calm down.

495
00:58:41,498 --> 00:58:44,104
No, he's not. The pressure
sensor Says it's empty.

496
00:58:44,397 --> 00:58:46,970
He's on the floor.
- Don't lie to me!

497
00:58:49,198 --> 00:58:51,698
Mr. Hart.

498
00:58:53,694 --> 00:58:56,194
Mr. Hart?

499
00:58:58,578 --> 00:59:01,078
It's not a good time right now.

500
00:59:05,631 --> 00:59:08,131
Could you open the door, please?

501
00:59:12,989 --> 00:59:15,489
Not one word, Sarah. Understood?

502
00:59:21,113 --> 00:59:24,168
Get out of the car, Sarah. Get out now!

503
00:59:24,732 --> 00:59:27,232
Hands where I can see them! Now!

504
00:59:39,504 --> 00:59:44,602
Mr. Hart! We've had complaints about
a leak coming from your bathroom.

505
00:59:47,587 --> 00:59:50,460
I'm looking at it right
now, and it seems fine.

506
00:59:52,044 --> 00:59:54,544
Well, I need to check it myself.

507
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:59,903
I don't have time.
- I am trying to help you.

508
01:00:00,550 --> 01:00:04,486
That's not the way he wants it.
- That's not how who wants it?

509
01:00:06,003 --> 01:00:10,050
Sarah, I read the note.
What the hell is going on with Roadlink?

510
01:00:12,977 --> 01:00:15,560
Someone has my daughter
and he is going to kill her.

511
01:00:17,793 --> 01:00:22,124
Someone has Kimmy? - Hart, if you
don't open the door, I'm coming in.

512
01:00:23,511 --> 01:00:26,406
It'll be just a minute.

513
01:00:36,589 --> 01:00:40,515
You're Hart? I know you like
these left outside your door.

514
01:00:55,974 --> 01:00:59,632
You know, these window coverings,
they could be a fire hazard.

515
01:01:02,832 --> 01:01:05,380
I have to get back in that car or
Wilkes is gonna kill my daughter.

516
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:10,397
Listen. Listen to me.
Look, just let me help you.

517
01:01:10,838 --> 01:01:14,768
We both know how these things
end, Sarah, he will kill her.

518
01:01:15,708 --> 01:01:18,208
No, he won't.

519
01:01:27,511 --> 01:01:30,011
Did you do this?

520
01:01:36,493 --> 01:01:38,993
You got a key to this?

521
01:02:03,352 --> 01:02:05,852
What the hell is going on?

522
01:02:09,285 --> 01:02:11,785
Kimmy? Kimmy?

523
01:02:37,003 --> 01:02:39,503
Kimmy!

524
01:02:40,798 --> 01:02:45,275
Don't look at me.
- Are you there?

525
01:02:45,694 --> 01:02:50,462
Kimmy, Get out of there
Any way! Can you hear me?

526
01:02:52,772 --> 01:02:55,272
Kimmy!

527
01:03:22,931 --> 01:03:25,540
I'm gonna need you to
put the keys on the table

528
01:03:25,619 --> 01:03:28,119
and get back into the bathroom now.

529
01:03:37,529 --> 01:03:40,029
Close the door, please.

530
01:03:44,871 --> 01:03:47,648
Ms. Crane.
- What just happened?

531
01:03:48,371 --> 01:03:51,264
I want you to know you both
brought this upon yourselves.

532
01:03:52,765 --> 01:03:55,928
With no Farina, there's no deal.
- Wait! No, no, no!

533
01:03:56,213 --> 01:03:58,713
Goodbye, Ms. Crane.
- Wait!

534
01:04:07,266 --> 01:04:11,783
Wilkes? Wilkes? Farina's here.

535
01:04:13,409 --> 01:04:15,963
He's seen better days but he's here.

536
01:04:28,055 --> 01:04:30,555
Pull out on the road
and go straight ahead.

537
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:41,900
How was the run, Paulo?

538
01:04:46,641 --> 01:04:49,141
What? what? What was that? What?

539
01:04:50,820 --> 01:04:53,410
It's your friend talking with
a mouthful of broken teeth.

540
01:04:53,789 --> 01:04:56,289
How far away from you am I?

541
01:05:04,658 --> 01:05:07,158
10 minutes. North.

542
01:05:10,111 --> 01:05:15,585
All right, So I'm gonna see my
daughter alive in 10 minutes, right?

543
01:05:16,562 --> 01:05:19,062
No, one stop first.

544
01:05:24,225 --> 01:05:26,604
What are we doing here?

545
01:05:26,605 --> 01:05:29,446
In my brief time with your husband,
I learned that your verbose guest in

546
01:05:29,512 --> 01:05:32,357
the backseat shared with him some
personal information about me.

547
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:38,341
Now, Roadlink tells me that Eddie
Spaghetti visited this facility

548
01:05:38,463 --> 01:05:41,536
on his last night, Yet there's
no locker in his name, Sarah.

549
01:05:42,015 --> 01:05:45,062
Could be nothing. Could beeverything.
I'm leaning towards the latter.

550
01:05:45,990 --> 01:05:48,814
If you're so sure that Ed had records
on you, why didn't you just come out

551
01:05:48,878 --> 01:05:52,007
and get them yourself?
- What?

552
01:05:58,777 --> 01:06:02,781
Must've been so frightening,

553
01:06:03,992 --> 01:06:06,574
being used to that dark cell.

554
01:06:06,810 --> 01:06:11,480
And then all of a sudden, all
of those people around you,

555
01:06:12,224 --> 01:06:15,865
getting moved around from
one foster family to the next.

556
01:06:16,096 --> 01:06:19,821
It'd make me want to keep
my distance from people too.

557
01:06:21,073 --> 01:06:23,487
I know what you're trying to do, and...

558
01:06:23,488 --> 01:06:26,982
It must've been so frightening,
And you must've felt so helpless.

559
01:06:27,032 --> 01:06:32,255
You want your daughter alive?
- Come on, Wilkes.

560
01:06:33,612 --> 01:06:38,541
We both know that you need me
'cause you can't leave your house.

561
01:06:40,551 --> 01:06:43,488
Just quit your pathetic attempt
at psychoanalyzing me, and just…

562
01:06:45,593 --> 01:06:49,234
Just do your job, Ms. Crane.

563
01:06:53,164 --> 01:06:56,728
You have 10 minutes.
Not one second more.

564
01:07:18,510 --> 01:07:22,971
So...I've been pulling babysitting
duty on this guy Paulo Farina

565
01:07:23,976 --> 01:07:27,769
And he tells me some interesting
things about Sheldon Wilkes,

566
01:07:27,917 --> 01:07:31,757
who he's gonna testify
against if we can find Wilkes.

567
01:07:33,151 --> 01:07:35,651
The thing with Wilkes is he's a ghost.

568
01:07:35,692 --> 01:07:39,341
They don't know anything about
him. So I got out and see if I can,

569
01:07:40,331 --> 01:07:43,743
you know, dig something up on him.
You know, help the suits. You know,

570
01:07:43,801 --> 01:07:46,301
maybe I can bust something open,
Maybe I can finally make detective.

571
01:07:47,269 --> 01:07:54,133
So I started looking for Wilkes,
And well, today he found me instead.

572
01:07:55,948 --> 01:08:01,702
He says he's hurt you and Kimmy,
Sarah, if I don't bring him Farina.

573
01:08:02,496 --> 01:08:04,996
Whatever happens, I did this
to protect you too, okay?

574
01:08:06,072 --> 01:08:09,407
I guess if you're seeing this, I'm gone.

575
01:08:14,050 --> 01:08:16,550
I'll keep you and Kimmy safe.

576
01:08:16,556 --> 01:08:20,283
Give all this Information
to Irons. He's a good guy.

577
01:08:22,294 --> 01:08:24,794
He'll know how to find Wilkes.

578
01:08:30,054 --> 01:08:32,554
Eddie thought he'd found Wilkes
when he busted in that door.

579
01:08:35,150 --> 01:08:37,650
The bastard set him up
and I knocked him down.

580
01:08:40,936 --> 01:08:43,436
We gotta go.

581
01:08:52,663 --> 01:08:56,508
Did you get what we need? - Yes. - If
I find there was anything left behind...

582
01:08:56,509 --> 01:09:00,217
There's nothing missing. It's
a good thing, too, Wilkes.

583
01:09:00,620 --> 01:09:03,120
There's a lot of
information on you in here.

584
01:09:03,558 --> 01:09:08,582
There's even a house address.Dunsmore
Street. That sound like home?

585
01:09:11,598 --> 01:09:14,098
Yeah, Eddie thought he found
me, too. You both get a zero.

586
01:09:14,636 --> 01:09:21,007
It's... It's 3400 Marine drive, number
24. Farina and your backpack

587
01:09:21,075 --> 01:09:23,575
equals one daughter, Alive and well.

588
01:10:42,342 --> 01:10:46,867
All units, officers need backup,
3400 Marine drive. Apartment 24.

589
01:11:19,641 --> 01:11:22,141
Kimmy?

590
01:11:25,329 --> 01:11:27,829
Kimmy?

591
01:11:35,914 --> 01:11:38,452
Where is she? Kimmy!

592
01:11:49,263 --> 01:11:51,763
Kimmy.

593
01:11:58,602 --> 01:12:01,464
She's not here. We gotta go. Sarah,
she's not here. Come on, we gotta go.

594
01:12:02,608 --> 01:12:05,776
We gotta go, Sarah. We gotta go.

595
01:12:07,151 --> 01:12:09,651
No.

596
01:12:20,158 --> 01:12:22,658
Sarah!

597
01:12:29,158 --> 01:12:31,658
No!

598
01:13:45,159 --> 01:13:47,659
Wilkes!

599
01:13:52,055 --> 01:13:55,777
Wilkes?
- She's gone. You killed her.

600
01:13:57,004 --> 01:14:01,004
No, she's alive. You're too
smart to toss in your chips now.

601
01:14:02,097 --> 01:14:06,923
You give me Kimmy, And you can still
slip off the grid and never lookback.

602
01:14:08,324 --> 01:14:10,525
No Farina, no deal.

603
01:14:10,526 --> 01:14:13,841
You're forgetting what I have
in my backpack. Information.

604
01:14:14,161 --> 01:14:19,571
Information All about
you. I over E, remember?

605
01:14:19,937 --> 01:14:22,437
Use your I over E.

606
01:14:23,118 --> 01:14:27,348
You had a good plan. It's gonna
work, Wilkes, and you know it,

607
01:14:28,116 --> 01:14:33,442
But before this goes any further,
I need to know Kimmy is still alive.

608
01:14:37,188 --> 01:14:39,688
Wilkes?

609
01:14:41,218 --> 01:14:45,085
Speak.
- Mom, it's okay. I'm okay.

610
01:14:46,631 --> 01:14:51,316
Your house 15 minutes, time Go.

611
01:14:52,094 --> 01:14:54,768
Okay, if there is anything
wrong with her, no deal.

612
01:14:54,889 --> 01:15:01,111
You don't make the deals! - I am t
he deal. 15 minutes, my house, timed.

613
01:16:22,808 --> 01:16:25,308
Hey.

614
01:16:26,541 --> 01:16:29,041
Hey.

615
01:16:52,113 --> 01:16:54,642
Wilkes.
Wilkes!

616
01:17:09,598 --> 01:17:12,098
Welcome home, Sarah.

617
01:17:13,338 --> 01:17:15,838
Close the door behind you.

618
01:17:16,460 --> 01:17:19,661
Everything okay, Wilkes?
You don't sound so good.

619
01:17:19,981 --> 01:17:22,481
Close the door.

620
01:17:27,169 --> 01:17:31,275
Where are you?
- I'm everywhere.

621
01:17:31,276 --> 01:17:35,449
I don't think that's true anymore,
Wilkes. You know when they re-release

622
01:17:35,519 --> 01:17:40,116
animals into the wild, most times,
they run right back to their cages.

623
01:17:41,548 --> 01:17:44,048
Where did you run to, Wilkes?

624
01:17:45,165 --> 01:17:47,981
You didn't come this far
to kill your daughter.

625
01:17:48,453 --> 01:17:50,953
I wanna know that she's okay.

626
01:17:53,506 --> 01:17:57,881
She's fine. - I wanna
see her. - She sees you.

627
01:17:58,369 --> 01:18:02,317
You're lying.
- I haven't lied to you once, Sarah.

628
01:18:05,203 --> 01:18:07,703
Where is she?

629
01:18:13,182 --> 01:18:16,913
She's in a good place.
- So, all of this,

630
01:18:17,652 --> 01:18:23,469
You killing Farina, Irons, my husband,

631
01:18:23,486 --> 01:18:28,177
all so you can remain anonymous?
You that afraid of the world, Wilkes?

632
01:18:30,686 --> 01:18:35,227
So now what? Where you gonna go?
Where are you gonna go now, Wilkes?

633
01:18:38,136 --> 01:18:40,636
I wanna talk to my daughter.

634
01:18:41,283 --> 01:18:44,304
Now take your husband's files
and put them on the floor.

635
01:18:57,379 --> 01:18:59,879
Put gun there too.

636
01:19:11,452 --> 01:19:13,952
Light them on fire.

637
01:19:15,568 --> 01:19:21,232
I'll burn half now. You give me my
daughter, Then I'll burn the rest.

638
01:19:23,524 --> 01:19:26,024
You burn half of the evidence,
I'll give you half your daughter.

639
01:20:17,129 --> 01:20:22,026
Put that videotape in too.
- No.

640
01:20:23,816 --> 01:20:29,173
What? - No, I'm not gonna do it. This is the
only thing keeping my daughter alive.

641
01:20:31,281 --> 01:20:34,392
Sarah. Put the videotape in the fire.

642
01:20:35,441 --> 01:20:39,235
No, Wilkes. You're gonna have to
come out here and do it yourself,

643
01:20:39,318 --> 01:20:44,714
'cause I wanna see my daughter. I'm
keeping this,until you bring me my

644
01:20:44,784 --> 01:20:48,766
daughter, unharmed, here, now.

645
01:20:51,172 --> 01:20:54,469
Put the tape in the fire!

646
01:20:55,371 --> 01:20:58,385
You're gonna have to crawl out
of your cave and face me, Wilkes.

647
01:20:59,575 --> 01:21:04,810
I know you're close. You're not
gonna be free until you get this,

648
01:21:05,353 --> 01:21:07,887
and you're not getting this
until I get my daughter.

649
01:22:09,649 --> 01:22:12,149
Hey... Help!

650
01:22:28,704 --> 01:22:32,901
What are you gonna do?
You don't even have a home.

651
01:22:36,875 --> 01:22:39,375
That's gotta suck? -Shut up.

652
01:23:07,129 --> 01:23:10,643
Mrs. Crane? This is Roadlink.
I see there's been an accident.

653
01:23:10,828 --> 01:23:13,328
I'm sending emergency
personnel right away.

654
01:23:26,379 --> 01:23:28,879
Look at me, Wilkes.

655
01:23:34,770 --> 01:23:37,270
Ms. Crane.

656
01:23:46,014 --> 01:23:48,514
Mom!

657
01:23:52,716 --> 01:23:55,216
My baby!

658
01:23:56,236 --> 01:23:58,736
Are you okay?
- Yeah.

659
01:23:59,039 --> 01:24:03,499
We're okay. It's gonna be okay.

660
01:24:18,788 --> 01:24:23,257
Sarah, Kimmy, I know I
probably didn't say it enough.

661
01:24:25,108 --> 01:24:27,608
This kind of thing
wasn't my strong suit.

662
01:24:28,313 --> 01:24:31,558
That's why I was gonna give
you this on our anniversary.

663
01:24:33,089 --> 01:24:37,163
#LIFE IS NOT MEASURED HOW MANY BREATHS YOU TAKE,
BUT BY HOW OFTEN YOUR BREATH IS TAKEN AWAY#

664
01:24:39,503 --> 01:24:45,098
You two, took my breath away every day.

665
01:24:47,229 --> 01:24:52,618
I love you, and I know that
you love me. - You better.

666
01:25:02,933 --> 01:25:05,418
Wanna go for a walk?

667
01:25:05,419 --> 01:25:10,096
If I can play you this
new tune I found. - Okay.

668
01:25:13,148 --> 01:25:15,648
It's kinda loud but I
think you can handle it.
