good luck in this new chapter of our lives.

Excuse the cliche,

25
00:01:35,162 --> 00:01:37,696
but they say that time flies when you're having fun.

26
00:01:37,698 --> 00:01:40,099
And I don't know about you guys,

27
00:01:40,101 --> 00:01:43,802
but I have had the best time of my life here

28
00:01:43,804 --> 00:01:45,537
at Madison college.

29
00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:47,806
Now...

30
00:01:47,808 --> 00:01:49,408

- Bring it in here, girls.
- Why do I get the feeling

38
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:07,292
we'll be calling Bob senator one day?

39
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:09,828
In 20 years, that guy's gonna be the president.

40
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,697
Everybody's having a good time.

41
00:02:11,699 --> 00:02:14,166
I'm already having a good time.

42
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:17,169
- Dude.
- Hey!

43
00:02:17,171 --> 00:02:18,804
Don't start with me.

44
00:02:18,806 --> 00:02:21,440
Look, the first semester, she was totally single,

45
00:02:21,442 --> 00:02:23,876
and you were actually the first person to meet her.

46
00:02:23,878 --> 00:02:26,879
- Yeah, I know.
I know I blew it, okay?

47
00:02:26,881 --> 00:02:29,381
I mean, usually I got pretty good game.

48
00:02:29,383 --> 00:02:31,450
But, you know, I get around Elizabeth

49
00:02:31,452 --> 00:02:32,518
and I get all loopy.

50
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,319
Yeah, well...

51
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:36,188
Speaking of game, how'd the breakup go with Rosie?

52
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,523
What do you mean, how'd it go?

53
00:02:37,525 --> 00:02:39,458
She kicked me in the nuts.
- Ooh. Were you wearing?

54
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:40,726
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

55
00:02:40,728 --> 00:02:42,194
You had to know that was coming.
- Oh, yeah.

56
00:02:42,196 --> 00:02:44,296
- Oh, here she comes.
- Hi, guys.

57
00:02:44,298 --> 00:02:45,797
Hey!

58
00:02:45,799 --> 00:02:47,699
- Hi.
- Hey.

59
00:02:47,701 --> 00:02:49,301
What are you guys talking about?

60
00:02:49,303 --> 00:02:50,903
- Baseball and...
- Oh.

61
00:02:50,905 --> 00:02:52,771
Guy stuff?
- Yeah.

62
00:02:52,773 --> 00:02:54,873
- So macho.
- Yeah.

63
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:57,376
- Yeah, let me get--
who wants a beer?

64
00:02:57,378 --> 00:02:58,944
- Yeah, I'll have--
- Beer? Two beers, three beers?

65
00:02:58,946 --> 00:03:01,613
- I'm okay.
Thank you.

66
00:03:01,615 --> 00:03:04,783
So...
Tomorrow's graduation.

67
00:03:04,785 --> 00:03:06,451
It's crazy, right?

68
00:03:06,453 --> 00:03:08,353
I know, right?
It's like four years

69
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:10,422
went by like that.
- Yeah.

70
00:03:10,424 --> 00:03:12,891
You should fly to visit me in San Diego.

71
00:03:12,893 --> 00:03:13,725
Mm...

72
00:03:13,727 --> 00:03:15,494
Yeah, I don't know.

73
00:03:15,496 --> 00:03:18,430
- You don't-- you don't know
if you wanna come see me?

74
00:03:18,432 --> 00:03:20,832
- No, no, it's not--
it's not what you think.

75
00:03:20,834 --> 00:03:23,502
It's... You know.
What I told you.

76
00:03:23,504 --> 00:03:25,304
Oh, the claustrophobia stuff.

77
00:03:25,306 --> 00:03:26,939
- Yes, I--

78
00:03:26,941 --> 00:03:28,907
- I kinda thought you were kidding about that.

79
00:03:28,909 --> 00:03:30,475
No. I don't kid
about that.

80
00:03:30,477 --> 00:03:32,711
I thought it was just elevators and things like that.

81
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:34,313
Yeah, it is, but then it kicks in pretty good

82
00:03:34,315 --> 00:03:39,318
The whole fear of plunging to a fiery, screaming death

83
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,954
tends to amplify it a bit.
- Right.

84
00:03:41,956 --> 00:03:43,522
We can talk about something else.

85
00:03:43,524 --> 00:03:46,458
Sure. But I do want you
to come visit me.

86
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:47,659
Okay.

87
00:03:47,661 --> 00:03:48,660
Lizzie!

88
00:03:48,662 --> 00:03:51,463
Um, hold on one second.

89
00:03:51,465 --> 00:03:54,666
I guess maybe one regret that I have is that,

90
00:03:54,668 --> 00:03:58,370
you know, with all the stupid boyfriends and girlfriends

91
00:03:58,372 --> 00:04:00,339
that we both had

92
00:04:00,341 --> 00:04:03,342
that you and I never gave it a shot.

93
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:06,311
Let's make a deal, Mitch.

94
00:04:06,313 --> 00:04:09,815
In ten years, if we haven't married other people,

95
00:04:09,817 --> 00:04:12,351
we marry each other.

96
00:04:12,353 --> 00:04:13,719
What do you say?

97
00:04:13,721 --> 00:04:15,020
Lizzie!

98
00:04:15,022 --> 00:04:16,822
We're gonna leave without you.

99
00:04:16,824 --> 00:04:18,690
Okay. Hold on.

100
00:04:18,692 --> 00:04:20,626
What do you say?

101
00:04:20,628 --> 00:04:21,827
Sure!

102
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:23,462
I love you so much, Mitch.

103
00:04:23,464 --> 00:04:25,564
I love you too.

104
00:04:26,899 --> 00:04:29,568
Okay. I'll see you soon.

105
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:31,903
Okay.

106
00:04:31,905 --> 00:04:34,573
- Bye.
- Bye.

107
00:04:37,677 --> 00:04:39,878
Huh? So?

108
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,546
How'd it go?

109
00:04:41,548 --> 00:04:42,948
To be honest,

110
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:46,385
I think I just got engaged.

111
00:04:47,987 --> 00:04:50,689
Now listen, I know what you're all thinking.

112
00:04:50,691 --> 00:04:53,325
Yeah, right, he's gonna wait ten years to marry her.

113
00:04:53,327 --> 00:04:55,961
I will admit, I did think about it.

114
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:57,529
For about a month.

115
00:04:57,531 --> 00:05:00,832
Now, as you can see, when I go on the first date,

116
00:05:00,834 --> 00:05:02,901
I got it down pretty good.
I mean,

117
00:05:02,903 --> 00:05:05,604
look at the way they laugh at my jokes.

118
00:05:05,606 --> 00:05:06,972
You can't fake that.

119
00:05:06,974 --> 00:05:09,408
Although with women, you never really can tell.

120
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:12,044
But first date--
I'm king.

121
00:05:12,046 --> 00:05:14,646
When we get a little deeper in the relationship...

122
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:17,683
Mitch, this is the best birthday dinner ever.

123
00:05:17,685 --> 00:05:19,685
You'd better be careful, mister.

124
00:05:19,687 --> 00:05:21,019
I might just use the "I" word tonight.

125
00:05:21,021 --> 00:05:23,021
That's when things go kablooey.

126
00:05:23,023 --> 00:05:25,357
It's your birthday?

127
00:05:27,628 --> 00:05:30,062
Don't ever call me again.

128
00:05:30,064 --> 00:05:32,564
For the last time, my name is Eleanor,

129
00:05:32,566 --> 00:05:34,533
not Elizabeth, jerk!

130
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:37,769
Well, ten years later,

131
00:05:37,771 --> 00:05:39,104
I'm still single.

132
00:05:39,106 --> 00:05:41,973
And I heard that Elizabeth already got married,

133
00:05:41,975 --> 00:05:45,577
so I guess it's just not meant to be.

134
00:05:52,552 --> 00:05:54,553
Okay.

135
00:05:54,555 --> 00:05:56,388
This is from me.

136
00:05:57,523 --> 00:06:00,625
- Thank you, Karen.
- Happy Birthday, Mitch.

137
00:06:00,627 --> 00:06:02,661
- Thank you.
Oh, my gosh.

138
00:06:02,663 --> 00:06:03,962
Oh, come on.

139
00:06:03,964 --> 00:06:06,498
Look at that.

140
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,867
- Nice watch.
What'd that run you?

141
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:11,436
- Easy!
Thank you, Karen.

142
00:06:11,438 --> 00:06:13,004
- You're welcome.

143
00:06:13,006 --> 00:06:16,041
Seriously, I, uh, I feel truly blessed

144
00:06:16,043 --> 00:06:17,642
to have friends like you.

145
00:06:17,644 --> 00:06:20,412
Are these wonderful gifts are just too much, so...

146
00:06:20,414 --> 00:06:22,681
- You're welcome!
- Thank you.

147
00:06:22,683 --> 00:06:25,417
Most of you.

148
00:06:25,419 --> 00:06:28,720
Is this a party, or what?

149
00:06:29,857 --> 00:06:31,490
- Look at you!
You made it!

150
00:06:31,492 --> 00:06:33,392
Hey, dude, I took the last ferry from montauk,

151
00:06:33,394 --> 00:06:35,427
got here in no time.
- And yet, you never visit.

152
00:06:35,429 --> 00:06:38,830
- Nice hat.
- Thank you very much.

153
00:06:38,832 --> 00:06:41,099
This is my good friend Dave breem

154
00:06:41,101 --> 00:06:42,567
from college, everybody.

155
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:45,604
This a birthday party or a funeral?

156
00:06:45,606 --> 00:06:46,738
Come on!
- Funeral.

157
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,106
Hey, hey, hey, easy.

158
00:06:48,108 --> 00:06:49,608
Now, who scored this month's bonus

159
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:51,810
and is picking up tonight's check, huh?

160
00:06:51,812 --> 00:06:54,179
- To Mitch.
- To Mitch.

161
00:06:54,181 --> 00:06:55,547
- <i>Thank you very much.</i>
- <i>Salud.</i>

162
00:06:55,549 --> 00:06:56,982
Waitress!

163
00:06:56,984 --> 00:06:59,151
Another round.
Cheap stuff?

164
00:06:59,153 --> 00:07:01,453
Good night, ladies!

165
00:07:01,455 --> 00:07:03,655
Hey, guys, it's last call.

166
00:07:03,657 --> 00:07:06,525
Would you like anything else before I close out your tab?

167
00:07:06,527 --> 00:07:08,960
No, I think just the check, thanks.

168
00:07:08,962 --> 00:07:10,128
Uh, um...

169
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:12,063
I would like to buy me and my buddy

170
00:07:12,065 --> 00:07:14,499
two shots of whiskey.

171
00:07:14,501 --> 00:07:17,169
Why don't you, uh...
Keep the change?

172
00:07:17,171 --> 00:07:19,070
Huh?

173
00:07:19,072 --> 00:07:21,473
You always know the right thing to do, man.

174
00:07:21,475 --> 00:07:23,875
That is because I'm the ying to your Yang.

175
00:07:23,877 --> 00:07:24,976
Oh!

176
00:07:24,978 --> 00:07:26,945
- What?
Oh, my-- dude.

177
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:28,113
Happy Birthday.

178
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:30,215
- Come on!
- Mm-hmm.

179
00:07:30,217 --> 00:07:32,117
You kept this?

180
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:33,952
Ten years, man.
How you holding up?

181
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:36,755
Eh.

182
00:07:36,757 --> 00:07:38,023
Man, if she only waited,

183
00:07:38,025 --> 00:07:41,493
we would have been great together.

184
00:07:41,495 --> 00:07:43,128
Yeah, I know.

185
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:45,130
Eh. Stupid to think
a girl like her

186
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:47,632
can go ten years and not find somebody.

187
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:49,468
I mean, it's not like I didn't try.

188
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:51,770
I mean, I scoured the Internet, you know?

189
00:07:51,772 --> 00:07:54,072
Facebook, Twitter--
nothing.

190
00:07:54,074 --> 00:07:55,774
This woman's off the grid.
Thank you.

191
00:07:55,776 --> 00:07:58,109
- Well, what if I told you--

192
00:07:58,111 --> 00:08:00,111
- oh, my God, who ordered the cabo?

193
00:08:00,113 --> 00:08:02,647
Seriously, I said bottom shelf, guys!

194
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:04,916
You know what?
I bet you it was damn Carl.

195
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:06,251
- Dude, would you stop?
In two seconds,

196
00:08:06,253 --> 00:08:07,853
you're not even gonna care about that.

197
00:08:07,855 --> 00:08:09,054
Yeah, that I'd like.

198
00:08:09,056 --> 00:08:10,522
Then this you'll love.

199
00:08:10,524 --> 00:08:12,257
You sitting down?
- Yeah, Dave.

200
00:08:12,259 --> 00:08:14,226
I'm sitting down.
- Okay, okay.

201
00:08:14,228 --> 00:08:17,562
She never got married.

202
00:08:17,564 --> 00:08:19,898
- No way.
- Yes, way!

203
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,967
- No, no, no, 'cause I read
in the alumni mag--

204
00:08:21,969 --> 00:08:23,668
are you messing with me?

205
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,937
- I'm not messing with you.
- Don't mess with me.

206
00:08:25,939 --> 00:08:27,939
- I'm not messing with you.
In fact, I'm trying to help you.

207
00:08:27,941 --> 00:08:29,841
I read the same thing too.
But I called the alumni office.

208
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:31,576
She never got married.

209
00:08:31,578 --> 00:08:34,546
This is her last known address in San Diego.

210
00:08:34,548 --> 00:08:37,916
San Diego.

211
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:39,784
Happy Birthday!

212
00:08:39,786 --> 00:08:41,653
It's meant to be, man!
- This might be meant to be.

213
00:08:41,655 --> 00:08:44,089
- This is really meant to be.
- This might be meant to be.

214
00:08:44,091 --> 00:08:46,258
I'll drink to that.

215
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,960
- Mmm!
- Oh, my God.

216
00:08:48,962 --> 00:08:50,962
Ugh...
- Give me my change!

217
00:08:50,964 --> 00:08:53,698
Dude, there's such better Mexican in this town.

218
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,634
Why do you keep going to this dump?

219
00:08:55,636 --> 00:08:57,202
- 'Cause it's got--
it's fiesta hour.

220
00:08:57,204 --> 00:08:58,837
We got, you know, free drinks.

221
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:00,105
- Uhh... But it's-- ugh.

222
00:09:00,107 --> 00:09:02,574
So what are you gonna do?

223
00:09:02,576 --> 00:09:04,309
Be honest?

224
00:09:04,311 --> 00:09:07,746
Probably same thing
I've always done-- nothing.

225
00:09:07,748 --> 00:09:09,548
Can I be honest?

226
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:12,117
That's stupid, man.
Come on-- go after the girl!

227
00:09:12,119 --> 00:09:16,154
She lives a long way away, and I am terrified of flying.

228
00:09:16,156 --> 00:09:18,189
Then drive.

229
00:09:18,191 --> 00:09:20,091
What about my job?

230
00:09:20,093 --> 00:09:21,893
- You hate your job.
- What about my fish?

231
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:24,229
- I'll feed your fish.
- What about my plants?

232
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:26,798
- I'll water 'em.
- What if she

233
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,934
doesn't love me back?
- Well, what if she

234
00:09:28,936 --> 00:09:30,135
love me back?
- All right.

235
00:09:30,137 --> 00:09:32,170
You're an animal.

236
00:09:32,172 --> 00:09:34,139
- Come on, man.
What if she does?

237
00:09:34,141 --> 00:09:36,741
You'll never know unless you get in this car

238
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:38,810
and go find out.

239
00:09:41,782 --> 00:09:42,881
Yo, yo!

240
00:09:42,883 --> 00:09:44,149
Thanks for the cocktails!

241
00:09:44,151 --> 00:09:45,917
- Carl?
- Yeah.

242
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,686
- Douche.
- Douche.

243
00:09:47,688 --> 00:09:49,287
- We're heading to val's.
You and your buddy wanna come?

244
00:09:49,289 --> 00:09:51,189
- Yeah, Mitch, come on.
Come for a night cap.

245
00:09:51,191 --> 00:09:53,892
- Yeah, Mitch.
Come!

246
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,829
I'm gonna have to pass.

247
00:09:57,831 --> 00:09:59,197
What, do you got something better to do?

248
00:09:59,199 --> 00:10:02,233
Yes, I do.

249
00:10:02,235 --> 00:10:04,636
I'm going to San Diego.

250
00:10:04,638 --> 00:10:07,072
- Yeah! All right!

251
00:10:07,074 --> 00:10:09,874

- Uh, hi.

00:12:10,263 --> 00:12:12,931
- Where ya headed?
- Uh, San Diego.

283
00:12:12,933 --> 00:12:16,134
- You look exhausted.
How long you been driving?

284
00:12:16,136 --> 00:12:18,236
- Sheesh.
About 11 hours.

285
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:20,205
What's your name, patriot?

286
00:12:20,207 --> 00:12:21,439
- Mitch.
- Hey, Mitch.

287
00:12:21,441 --> 00:12:23,274
Nice to meet ya.
I'm Laura.

288
00:12:23,276 --> 00:12:25,877
- Hi.
- You know, I run

289
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:27,946
a bed and breakfast just up the road.

290
00:12:27,948 --> 00:12:30,281
- Oh, well, uh...
That's okay.

291
00:12:30,283 --> 00:12:32,484
- Come on.
I didn't meant to startle ya.

292
00:12:32,486 --> 00:12:35,320
But you just look too cute not to meet.

293
00:12:35,322 --> 00:12:38,123
I got a nice bed and a hot shower.

294
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:40,024
I was even gonna cook.

295
00:12:40,026 --> 00:12:41,793
You like spicy?

296
00:12:41,795 --> 00:12:44,262
Yeah, I don't know.

297
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:48,366
Mmm. Oh, my gosh.

298
00:12:48,368 --> 00:12:50,769
That was fantastic.

299
00:12:50,771 --> 00:12:52,904
Thank you.
- That's sweet.

300
00:12:52,906 --> 00:12:54,839
There's more if you like.
- After 11 hours of driving

301
00:12:54,841 --> 00:12:57,275
and three glasses of wine and a meal like that...

302
00:12:57,277 --> 00:12:59,878
Just point me to bed.
I am done.

303
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:03,081
- Mmm. Bed.
That sounds real nice.

304
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:04,449
Oh--

305
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:07,218
You really are cute.

306
00:13:12,893 --> 00:13:14,192
Don't move.

307
00:13:14,194 --> 00:13:16,828
- Wh--

308
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:18,930
- hello.

309
00:13:18,932 --> 00:13:20,832
Oh, hey, Rudy.

310
00:13:20,834 --> 00:13:22,100
It's my brother.

311
00:13:22,102 --> 00:13:24,035
It'll just be a sec.

312
00:13:24,037 --> 00:13:25,837
- Okay.
- Really?

313
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:28,139
That's kinda last minute.

314
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:30,942
But I have a guest here.

315
00:13:32,044 --> 00:13:35,079
All right, I'll see ya in a bit.

316
00:13:37,516 --> 00:13:39,951
My brother and his friends get together once a week

317
00:13:39,953 --> 00:13:43,154
and they lost their usual place, so...

318
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:45,223
He asked if he could come here.

319
00:13:45,225 --> 00:13:48,092
But I said he had to be real quiet.

320
00:13:48,094 --> 00:13:48,594
Um...

321
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:57,502
I'll just...

322
00:13:57,504 --> 00:13:59,838
Probably...
- Okay.

323
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,539
Who is she, and what's her name?

324
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:04,142
What do you mean?

325
00:14:04,144 --> 00:14:06,044
Uh...

326
00:14:06,046 --> 00:14:07,512
Elizabeth.

327
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:09,480
I haven't seen her since college,

328
00:14:09,482 --> 00:14:11,049
and we made this pact back then

329
00:14:11,051 --> 00:14:12,884
that if we weren't married in ten years,

330
00:14:12,886 --> 00:14:14,385
we were gonna marry each other.

331
00:14:14,387 --> 00:14:16,588
So here it is ten years later,

332
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:19,424
and, uh...
I'm gonna track her down.

333
00:14:19,426 --> 00:14:22,894
You made the old friend college

334
00:14:22,896 --> 00:14:24,195
ten-year pact?

335
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:26,464
Sounds kinda dumb when you say it like that.

336
00:14:26,466 --> 00:14:28,166
No, it is kinda dumb.

337
00:14:28,168 --> 00:14:31,402
- Maybe, but...
I have to try.

338
00:14:31,404 --> 00:14:35,573
Are you sure?

339
00:14:35,575 --> 00:14:37,141
If I had a nickel

340
00:14:37,143 --> 00:14:39,010
for every time a beautiful woman like yourself

341
00:14:39,012 --> 00:14:42,080
tried to take me to bed, including right now...

342
00:14:42,082 --> 00:14:43,248
You'd have a nickel?

343
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,582
Maybe a dime.

344
00:14:44,584 --> 00:14:46,584
Well, she's lucky to have you,

345
00:14:46,586 --> 00:14:48,953
even if she doesn't know it.

346
00:14:48,955 --> 00:14:50,455
Thank you.

347
00:14:50,457 --> 00:14:52,957
I would love to find some guy

348
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:54,659
to take me away from this life.

349
00:14:54,661 --> 00:14:57,896
You? I'm sure you have
plenty of offers.

350
00:14:57,898 --> 00:15:00,331
I seem to be attracted to losers.

351
00:15:02,435 --> 00:15:04,135
Wait a minute.

352
00:15:04,137 --> 00:15:06,938
Did she just call me a loser?

353
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:09,474
I haven't felt that awkward
since my first day of college.

354
00:15:12,479 --> 00:15:14,212
- Here we go.
- Whoop! Yeah.

355
00:15:14,214 --> 00:15:15,680
- College!
- All right!

356
00:15:15,682 --> 00:15:19,150
Got in.

357
00:15:23,122 --> 00:15:24,255
- Mitch.
- Oh.

358
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:26,291
I'm Dave.
- Hey.

359
00:15:26,293 --> 00:15:28,226
Cool!
- Okay, all right.

360
00:15:28,228 --> 00:15:30,194
This'll work.

361
00:15:32,231 --> 00:15:35,266
Now that that's settled, I'm gonna go take a whiz.

362
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:37,669
College!
- College.

363
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:57,721
O-ma-o-ma-my-ma...

364
00:16:03,229 --> 00:16:08,266
O-ma-o-ma-my-ma...

365
00:16:08,268 --> 00:16:10,234
- What the f--

366
00:16:19,179 --> 00:16:22,313
Aah! Ohh!

367
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:25,249
Ohh!

368
00:16:25,251 --> 00:16:27,285
- Mitch?

369
00:16:27,287 --> 00:16:31,022
A-are you all right?

370
00:16:31,024 --> 00:16:32,991
I'm fine.

371
00:16:32,993 --> 00:16:34,192
Thank you.

372
00:16:34,194 --> 00:16:38,129
I thought I heard a crash in there.

373
00:16:38,131 --> 00:16:40,064
Uh...

374
00:16:40,066 --> 00:16:42,633
I just dropped some change on the table.

375
00:16:42,635 --> 00:16:44,235
I'm good.

376
00:16:44,237 --> 00:16:46,771
Honey, can you open the door, please?

377
00:16:46,773 --> 00:16:48,306
Ohh...

378
00:16:48,308 --> 00:16:50,575
Coming.

379
00:16:50,577 --> 00:16:53,277
Ohh... Ooh.

380
00:16:57,116 --> 00:17:00,151
See? All good.

381
00:17:00,153 --> 00:17:03,488
Actually, I'm glad you're awake.

382
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:05,623
Oh, really?

383
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:08,192
My brother and his friends are outside,

384
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:11,162
and he'd like to meet you.
- Your brother what?

385
00:17:11,164 --> 00:17:13,231
- He'd like to meet you.
- Do you think

386
00:17:13,233 --> 00:17:15,666
that's a good idea?
I mean, he seems...

387
00:17:15,668 --> 00:17:18,403
Pretty busy with the boys and all.

388
00:17:18,405 --> 00:17:22,306
Laura! Get your sorry butt
out here with your friend now.

389
00:17:22,308 --> 00:17:24,475
Rudy, don't push me!

390
00:17:24,477 --> 00:17:26,377
Mitch is getting dressed

391
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:29,080
<i>and will be out in a minute!</i>

392
00:17:29,082 --> 00:17:31,082
Sorry.
- That's okay.

393
00:17:31,084 --> 00:17:34,252
If you could...
If you could just get dressed

394
00:17:34,254 --> 00:17:38,556
and come out with me, it would be really great.

395
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:40,525
I'll be out in a sec.

396
00:17:40,527 --> 00:17:43,094
Okay.

397
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,631
I'm dead!

398
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:52,470
I knew about you as soon as I met you.

399
00:17:52,472 --> 00:17:54,338
As did I you, sir.

400
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:56,474
- Sir.
- Sir?

401
00:17:56,476 --> 00:17:57,675
Well, look out, everybody.

402
00:17:57,677 --> 00:17:59,644
Here comes sir Rudy!

403
00:18:04,116 --> 00:18:07,685
- Well, I gotta get going.
Got a long drive ahead of me.

404
00:18:07,687 --> 00:18:09,754
Hey, listen, we are gonna be out in Zuma

405
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:11,122

Hey, man.

426
00:19:08,515 --> 00:19:10,748
- Oh, hey, man!
Where are you?

427
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,683
- Texas.
- Texas?

428
00:19:12,685 --> 00:19:14,819
Only two things in Texas--

429
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:16,854
and you're not a steer.

430
00:19:16,856 --> 00:19:19,157
- How's it going?
You got a number for me?

431
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:21,726
- Sorry, but you're really...
Not gonna like this.

432
00:19:21,728 --> 00:19:23,494
Aw, dude, after the night I had,

433
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:25,897
it's not even gonna matter.
Just shoot.

434
00:19:25,899 --> 00:19:27,732
Yeah, she doesn't

435
00:19:27,734 --> 00:19:29,667
live in, um, San Diego.

436
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:32,270
She lives in Hawaii.
Hawaii?

437
00:19:32,272 --> 00:19:34,272
- Yeah, dude, Hawaii.
But look, you can do this.

438
00:19:34,274 --> 00:19:36,207
How am I gonna get to Hawaii?

439
00:19:36,209 --> 00:19:37,842
Is there a boat?
- No, dude.

440
00:19:37,844 --> 00:19:39,777
Not unless you want to spend $5,000.

441
00:19:39,779 --> 00:19:41,379
But you can take a flight.

442
00:19:43,883 --> 00:19:46,184
What the--

443
00:19:47,419 --> 00:19:49,220
- I'll tell you what.
I'll tell you what.

444
00:19:49,222 --> 00:19:51,255
I will book you-- come here.
I'll book you a ticket.

445
00:19:51,257 --> 00:19:53,224
Right there.
Perfect, baby, just--

446
00:19:53,226 --> 00:19:54,892
- all right, look, just book it.

447
00:19:54,894 --> 00:19:56,794
And I got the number of a smoking hot woman

448
00:19:56,796 --> 00:19:58,629
I'll give you, okay?

449
00:19:58,631 --> 00:20:00,464
- Oh, really?
One sec.

450
00:20:00,466 --> 00:20:02,567
How hot?

451
00:20:02,569 --> 00:20:03,701
Just book the ticket.

452
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:06,370
- All right, okay.
Guess what.

453
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:08,806
All right, one second.
Ooh... Pow!

454
00:20:08,808 --> 00:20:10,908
All right, mm-hmm.

455
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:13,945
You owe me $600.

456
00:20:13,947 --> 00:20:15,479
- Fine.
- Call you back.

457
00:20:15,481 --> 00:20:18,482
I'm in the middle of something.
Safe flight.

458
00:20:18,484 --> 00:20:20,318
Ooh! Hit me one time.

459
00:20:24,856 --> 00:20:27,858
- We got you in 21b.
It's a middle seat.

460
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:29,794
Apologize.
That's all we have.

461
00:20:29,796 --> 00:20:34,265
Have a good flight.
Mahalo.

462
00:20:35,334 --> 00:20:36,901
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

463
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:39,370
Please make sure you are with your bags at all times.

464
00:20:39,372 --> 00:20:42,340
Do not leave bags unattended.

465
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:46,777
You okay?

466
00:20:46,779 --> 00:20:49,747
'Cause you don't look well.

467
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:51,882
- I-I don't like flying.

468
00:20:51,884 --> 00:20:54,752
- Oh, God, me neither.
It's just gross.

469
00:20:56,555 --> 00:20:58,422
Hey, look, uh...

470
00:20:58,424 --> 00:21:01,392
I was gonna pound half of this before the flight.

471
00:21:01,394 --> 00:21:04,795
No need to waste it.
You wanna share?

472
00:21:04,797 --> 00:21:07,365
How'd you get that past security?

473
00:21:07,367 --> 00:21:10,401
- I lifted it off
a duty-free.

474
00:21:10,403 --> 00:21:14,505
Welcome to the amarillo international airport.

475
00:21:14,507 --> 00:21:17,441
For your safety, please obey the following

476
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:19,510
airport guidelines.

477
00:21:19,512 --> 00:21:21,012
Drink deeply.

478
00:21:21,014 --> 00:21:22,747
Yeah.

479
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:28,586
- Oh, my goodness.
Come to daddy.

480
00:21:28,588 --> 00:21:29,920
Mm.

481
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:32,990
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

482
00:21:32,992 --> 00:21:35,760
Mm! Mm!

483
00:21:39,832 --> 00:21:42,433
- Oh, yeah, baby.
- Thank you.

484
00:21:42,435 --> 00:21:44,802
- Mm-hmm.

485
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:46,404
You're welcome.

486
00:21:46,406 --> 00:21:48,072
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

487
00:21:48,074 --> 00:21:50,808
We are now boarding aloha flight 3345

488
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:52,376
to Honolulu.

489
00:21:52,378 --> 00:21:54,845
- Um... That's me.
Is that you?

490
00:21:54,847 --> 00:21:57,315
- Uh, that's me.
- Yah, that's us.

491
00:21:57,317 --> 00:21:58,749
That's good.
That's us.

492
00:21:58,751 --> 00:22:00,084
All right.

493
00:22:00,086 --> 00:22:03,921
All right.
I'll, uh... See you on the plane.

494
00:22:05,557 --> 00:22:08,025
All righty.

495
00:22:08,027 --> 00:22:11,429
Keep that.
It's for you.

496
00:22:13,865 --> 00:22:15,766
Boarding group 4.

497
00:22:15,768 --> 00:22:18,502
Only those passengers with a 4 on their boarding pass

498
00:22:18,504 --> 00:22:20,805
should come to the gate.

499
00:22:21,974 --> 00:22:24,108
Ah! We're going down!

500
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:26,077
I'm so sorry.
It's my phone.

501
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:28,879
I'm sorry.
It's Dave.

502
00:22:28,881 --> 00:22:31,449
Hello.
- Dude, oh, good, I got you.

503
00:22:31,451 --> 00:22:33,417
Where are you?
- I'm boarding right now.

504
00:22:33,419 --> 00:22:34,952
- No! Get off.
I was wrong.

505
00:22:34,954 --> 00:22:37,021
Elizabeth is not in Hawaii.

506
00:22:37,023 --> 00:22:39,824
She's--.

507
00:22:39,826 --> 00:22:41,625
- Yeah.
- Your pilot's drunk.

508
00:22:41,627 --> 00:22:43,594
- Don't get on the plane.
- Where am I going?

509
00:22:43,596 --> 00:22:44,829
- She's in Pasadena.
- Pasadena?

510
00:22:44,831 --> 00:22:47,131
You're welcome.

511
00:22:54,072 --> 00:22:57,408
- Morning.
- Morning, honey.

512
00:22:57,410 --> 00:23:00,144
Anything in there that I need to know?

513
00:23:00,146 --> 00:23:03,047
Once again, not unless you like politics.

514
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:04,715
Mm, my favorite.

515
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:06,851
I don't know how you read that day after day.

516
00:23:06,853 --> 00:23:08,586
Doesn't it drive you nuts?

517
00:23:08,588 --> 00:23:10,121
If you don't read about what's going on

518
00:23:10,123 --> 00:23:12,123
in this country, Elizabeth,

519
00:23:12,125 --> 00:23:15,459
how can you expect to be an educated voter?

520
00:23:15,461 --> 00:23:18,095
- Vote?
What's that?

521
00:23:18,097 --> 00:23:20,798
Mom, I'm kidding.
God.

522
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,967
I was thinking of going over

523
00:23:22,969 --> 00:23:25,136
and taking in a movie today.

524
00:23:25,138 --> 00:23:27,104
Care to join me?
- I would love to,

525
00:23:27,106 --> 00:23:29,707
but I have an appointment
with Mrs. Stanton and her kids.

526
00:23:29,709 --> 00:23:31,041
The family you sponsor?

527
00:23:31,043 --> 00:23:32,743
Yeah. They're part of
my training.

528
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:34,879
Three weeks, and then
I'm a full-time social worker.

529
00:23:34,881 --> 00:23:36,480
And I have to go get ready for work.

530
00:23:36,482 --> 00:23:38,616
What time did they say buddy was gonna be ready?

531
00:23:38,618 --> 00:23:40,751
- 5:00.
- Thank you.

532
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:43,754
Turn on rush in the car.

533
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,041
She must be unlisted, 'cause I got nothing.

534
00:24:04,043 --> 00:24:07,144
- No, I know, I tried--
I tried everybody.

535
00:24:07,146 --> 00:24:09,013
What would you do--
did you try Becky?

536
00:24:09,015 --> 00:24:11,115
Maybe you should give her a call.

537
00:24:11,117 --> 00:24:12,550
- Oh, Becky?
- Hey.

538
00:24:12,552 --> 00:24:14,785
That chick scares me.

539
00:24:14,787 --> 00:24:16,520
Ah...

540
00:24:16,522 --> 00:24:18,989
Yeah, try Becky and then get back to me, all right?

541
00:24:18,991 --> 00:24:21,725
- I'll text her.
- Okay.

542
00:24:21,727 --> 00:24:23,994
Take care, buddy.
- Peace!

543
00:24:26,097 --> 00:24:27,565
- God!
- Don't freak out.

544
00:24:27,567 --> 00:24:30,134
- Whoa-- whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

545
00:24:30,136 --> 00:24:32,603
What the hell you doing with my girl?

546
00:24:32,605 --> 00:24:34,538
- I wasn't doing anything!
- Shut up!

547
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:36,707
- J-just don't cut me.
- I said shut up.

548
00:24:36,709 --> 00:24:38,509
Damn it, Eddie, just leave me alone.

549
00:24:38,511 --> 00:24:41,912
So, uh... How long
this been going on?

550
00:24:41,914 --> 00:24:43,180
There's nothing going on.

551
00:24:43,182 --> 00:24:45,015
He gives me everything you don't.

552
00:24:45,017 --> 00:24:46,717
- What?
- What?

553
00:24:46,719 --> 00:24:48,486
You just don't love me!

554
00:24:48,488 --> 00:24:50,688
So I don't love you, huh?

555
00:24:53,258 --> 00:24:55,593
Then what's this then?

556
00:24:55,595 --> 00:24:58,195
What the hell am I supposed to do with that?

557
00:24:58,197 --> 00:24:59,864
Fine.

558
00:24:59,866 --> 00:25:01,799
Choke on it.
- Hey!

559
00:25:01,801 --> 00:25:04,835
Is that how you want her to remember the big question?

560
00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:06,871
Listen, do you know how long

561
00:25:06,873 --> 00:25:08,706
some people wait their whole lives

562
00:25:08,708 --> 00:25:10,274
to be with the one person they love,

563
00:25:10,276 --> 00:25:12,643
and you two morons have found each other,

564
00:25:12,645 --> 00:25:14,879
and you're wasting precious time

565
00:25:14,881 --> 00:25:16,981
acting like children.

566
00:25:16,983 --> 00:25:18,916
Now, she obviously loves you

567
00:25:18,918 --> 00:25:21,552
if she's jumping in a car with a complete stranger...

568
00:25:21,554 --> 00:25:22,987
Right?

569
00:25:22,989 --> 00:25:25,189
- Right.
- Looking to get your attention.

570
00:25:25,191 --> 00:25:26,891
Now, he obviously loves you

571
00:25:26,893 --> 00:25:29,860
if he's willing to go to prison for life over you.

572
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:31,896
Well, it'd probably be 10 to 12 for good behavior.

573
00:25:31,898 --> 00:25:36,166
The point is the two of you are right here right now,

574
00:25:36,168 --> 00:25:38,102
and you know what you want.

575
00:25:38,104 --> 00:25:39,837
I'm so sorry, baby.

576
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:43,307
I just get worried you're gonna leave me.

577
00:25:44,843 --> 00:25:46,677
I love you so much,

578
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:49,647
and I want you to be my one and only.

579
00:25:54,586 --> 00:25:58,856
Oh, Eddie, I just want you so bad right now.

580
00:25:58,858 --> 00:25:59,924
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

581
00:25:59,926 --> 00:26:01,225
Why don't you hop back here

582
00:26:01,227 --> 00:26:03,627
and give me some
of that sweet-smelling sugar.

583
00:26:03,629 --> 00:26:06,997
- I'm, uh...
I'm gonna step out.

584
00:26:06,999 --> 00:26:09,099

Mrs. Carter.

- Yes.

608
00:26:59,185 --> 00:27:00,784

609
00:27:00,786 --> 00:27:02,052

Damn it.

612
00:27:06,058 --> 00:27:08,225
- Yes?

613
00:27:08,227 --> 00:27:10,127
- Mrs. Carter--
- Whatever you're selling,

614
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:11,195
I'm not buying.

615
00:27:11,197 --> 00:27:13,230
But thank you for trying.

616
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:17,234
You on the cell phone, pull over now!

617
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:25,676
Welcome to California.

618
00:27:42,962 --> 00:27:44,328
Hello.

619
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:46,263
- Hi, Mrs. Carter.
Please don't hang up.

620
00:27:46,265 --> 00:27:47,965
- Who is this?
Is this acorn?

621
00:27:47,967 --> 00:27:49,333
No. My name's Mitch Becker.

622
00:27:49,335 --> 00:27:51,235
I'm an old college friend of Elizabeth's.

623
00:27:51,237 --> 00:27:52,936
I was trying to get in touch with her.

624
00:27:52,938 --> 00:27:54,238
- Uh-huh.
Pecker.

625
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,206
No. Becker, with a "B."

626
00:27:56,208 --> 00:27:57,441
- Oh.
Oh, Mitch!

627
00:27:57,443 --> 00:27:59,410
Mitch!
Oh, I'm so sorry.

628
00:27:59,412 --> 00:28:01,378
I was trying to get in touch with Elizabeth.

629
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:02,946
I'm in town.
I'd like to see her.

630
00:28:02,948 --> 00:28:04,848
Oh, she'll be so excited to hear from you.

631
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:06,817
Oh, my goodness.
Listen, do you have

632
00:28:06,819 --> 00:28:08,919
one of those G.S.P. thingies
in your car?

633
00:28:08,921 --> 00:28:12,122
If you do, you could meet her at the dog groomer.

634
00:28:12,124 --> 00:28:13,824
She's picking up her dog
at 5:00.

635
00:28:13,826 --> 00:28:15,759
- That'd be great.
Um...

636
00:28:15,761 --> 00:28:17,227
Well, let me get you the address then.

637
00:28:17,229 --> 00:28:20,931
Oh, she'll be so surprised to see you!

638
00:28:36,182 --> 00:28:37,414
- Hi, Lizzie.
- Hey, Sally.

639
00:28:37,416 --> 00:28:39,783
Is buddy ready?
- You betcha.

640
00:28:39,785 --> 00:28:41,318
I'll go get him.

641
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,754
- Thanks.

642
00:28:43,756 --> 00:28:46,256
- Knock it off!

643
00:28:46,258 --> 00:28:48,992
Shut up!

644
00:28:48,994 --> 00:28:51,962
Hey, I said quiet!

645
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,835
Go see mommy.
There she is!

646
00:28:57,837 --> 00:28:59,369
- How are you?
How do you feel, boy?

647
00:28:59,371 --> 00:29:01,171
- He did great, as always.
- Oh, thanks.

648
00:29:01,173 --> 00:29:03,373
You wanna go on a run later?

649
00:29:05,477 --> 00:29:08,178
Okay!
- How's the training going?

650
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:09,913
Good. I'm almost done.

651
00:29:09,915 --> 00:29:12,149
Sounds crazy back there.
How are you?

652
00:29:12,151 --> 00:29:14,918
Uh, honestly, I'm thinking cats.

653
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,954
- Buddy, no!

654
00:29:19,491 --> 00:29:22,493
- Ohh!
God!

655
00:29:22,495 --> 00:29:24,495
- Oh, my gosh!
Buddy, stay!

656
00:29:24,497 --> 00:29:26,363
Bad dog!
Sir, are you okay?

657
00:29:26,365 --> 00:29:28,365
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

658
00:29:28,367 --> 00:29:30,234
Are you all right?

659
00:29:30,236 --> 00:29:32,402
Oh, my God, I feel so bad.

660
00:29:35,006 --> 00:29:36,840
Elizabeth.

661
00:29:36,842 --> 00:29:39,109
Mitch?

662
00:29:45,151 --> 00:29:46,850
Back soon, mom.

663
00:29:46,852 --> 00:29:48,185
- Welcome home, buddy.

664
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:54,191
Pink toenail Polish.

665
00:29:54,193 --> 00:29:56,927
I got beaten up.

666
00:29:58,230 --> 00:29:59,963
- I'm speechless!
- No.

667
00:29:59,965 --> 00:30:03,467
It's really you.
- It's really me.

668
00:30:03,469 --> 00:30:05,102
You look great.

669
00:30:05,104 --> 00:30:07,538
I was just about to say the same thing about you.

670
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:10,574
So what are you doing here?

671
00:30:12,844 --> 00:30:16,346
You look like you need to tell me something.

672
00:30:18,049 --> 00:30:20,350
Are you sick?
You're not sick, are you?

673
00:30:20,352 --> 00:30:23,120
- No. No, no.
Uh...

674
00:30:23,122 --> 00:30:24,388
What about you?

675
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:26,323
Last I heard, you were married.

676
00:30:26,325 --> 00:30:28,992
Hmm. Uh, no, not yet.

677
00:30:28,994 --> 00:30:32,029
I was going to, and that didn't happen.

678
00:30:32,031 --> 00:30:33,997
It wasn't, um...

679
00:30:33,999 --> 00:30:36,066
Really my choice.

680
00:30:36,068 --> 00:30:37,301
What about you?

681
00:30:37,303 --> 00:30:39,102
- Me.
- Mm-hmm.

682
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:41,505
- Married?

683
00:30:41,507 --> 00:30:44,107
I would have thought you'd be married by now.

684
00:30:44,109 --> 00:30:46,109
Funny you should say that.

685
00:30:46,111 --> 00:30:49,246
- Why?
- It's...

686
00:30:49,248 --> 00:30:53,350
It's funny because I...

687
00:30:53,352 --> 00:30:56,320
I, um...

688
00:30:56,322 --> 00:30:58,589
Have to go to the bathroom,

689
00:30:58,591 --> 00:31:01,325
and I will be right back.

690
00:31:01,327 --> 00:31:04,127
- Okay.
- Excuse me.

691
00:31:11,135 --> 00:31:13,070
Oh, come on, Mitch.

692
00:31:13,072 --> 00:31:14,438
Get it together, man!

693
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,106
You've been waiting on this.

694
00:31:16,108 --> 00:31:18,609
It's gonna be fine.
It's gonna be good.

695
00:31:18,611 --> 00:31:20,210
You got this.
You got this.

696
00:31:20,212 --> 00:31:23,080
Really. 'Cause now you're
talking to your penis.

697
00:31:23,082 --> 00:31:25,482
That's fantastic.

698
00:31:29,187 --> 00:31:31,121
Great.

699
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:35,325
Elizabeth...

700
00:31:35,327 --> 00:31:37,194
We made a promise to each other

701
00:31:37,196 --> 00:31:38,495
ten years ago.

702
00:31:38,497 --> 00:31:40,197
I'm here to honor that promise.

703
00:31:40,199 --> 00:31:43,333
I'm here to say to you,
"will you marry me?"

704
00:31:43,335 --> 00:31:46,036
I'm sorry.

705
00:31:46,038 --> 00:31:48,572
Good luck, bro.

706
00:32:04,523 --> 00:32:06,089
Jake, remember how I told you about

707
00:32:06,091 --> 00:32:07,925
my college best friend who was a guy,

708
00:32:07,927 --> 00:32:09,660
and you said that it was impossible

709
00:32:09,662 --> 00:32:11,962
for guys and girls to be friends,

710
00:32:11,964 --> 00:32:13,664
'cause the guy always wants to get in the girl's pants?

711
00:32:13,666 --> 00:32:15,532
Well, no, babe, what I actually said was only guys

712
00:32:15,534 --> 00:32:18,101
who are friends with attractive women can't be.

713
00:32:18,103 --> 00:32:21,338
Jake Jones, meet my college best friend Mitch Becker.

714
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:23,974
- How you doing?
- Nice to meet you.

715
00:32:23,976 --> 00:32:25,976
- Oh, wait a minute.
I do remember!

716
00:32:25,978 --> 00:32:27,978
Yeah, from some of the college photos that you showed me.

717
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:29,246
- Yes!
- I didn't recognize you

718
00:32:29,248 --> 00:32:30,981
without that perm.

719
00:32:30,983 --> 00:32:32,382
Ha ha ha.

720
00:32:32,384 --> 00:32:34,117
Knock it off.

721
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:36,053
- I'm just messing around.
Friend?

722
00:32:36,055 --> 00:32:38,522
- Friends.
- Good. That's better.

723
00:32:38,524 --> 00:32:41,491
Because I could not have you come to my wedding

724
00:32:41,493 --> 00:32:44,328
hating my fiance.

725
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:46,096
Huh?

726
00:32:46,098 --> 00:32:48,966
Jake and I are getting married.

727
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:51,501
Really?

728
00:32:51,503 --> 00:32:54,504
Congratulations.

729
00:32:54,506 --> 00:32:56,006
When?

730
00:32:56,008 --> 00:32:57,541
Ten days.

731
00:32:57,543 --> 00:33:00,644
That's fantastic!

732
00:33:00,646 --> 00:33:03,113
You should stay for the wedding!

733
00:33:03,115 --> 00:33:04,648
Would you?

734
00:33:06,184 --> 00:33:08,452
Well, while he contemplates that,

735
00:33:08,454 --> 00:33:10,020
I'll go ahead and pay the check.

736
00:33:10,022 --> 00:33:12,556
- I'll get it.
- Okay.

737
00:33:19,464 --> 00:33:20,564
Just tell him I'll be there in a sec.

738
00:33:20,566 --> 00:33:22,466
I'm on my way, okay?

739
00:33:22,468 --> 00:33:24,001
God!

740
00:33:24,003 --> 00:33:26,036
Oh, wait a minute.
I have something for you.

741
00:33:26,038 --> 00:33:28,005
- You do?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

742
00:33:28,007 --> 00:33:31,174
Here you go.
- No!

743
00:33:31,176 --> 00:33:33,210
Babe, it's beautiful.
Thank you.

744
00:33:33,212 --> 00:33:35,612
Wait a minute.
I just gave you a wedding ring.

745
00:33:35,614 --> 00:33:37,714
I need a little something extra than that.

746
00:33:37,716 --> 00:33:39,316
Mmm.
- Mm. Thank you.

747
00:33:39,318 --> 00:33:41,418
She didn't think I could get the ring resized

748
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:44,021
in time for the wedding.
- I didn't say that.

749
00:33:44,023 --> 00:33:45,789
But I did, and she was wrong.

750
00:33:45,791 --> 00:33:48,025
Like she always is.
- Okay, don't listen to him.

751
00:33:48,027 --> 00:33:49,426
I am not always wrong.
- Oh, really?

752
00:33:49,428 --> 00:33:51,261
What about the Christmas party
last year-- remember?

753
00:33:51,263 --> 00:33:53,130
You're gonna bring up the Christmas party?

754
00:33:53,132 --> 00:33:54,731
- Yeah, I'm-- you gotta
hear this, rich.

755
00:33:54,733 --> 00:33:56,366
This is hysterical.
- Mitch.

756
00:33:56,368 --> 00:33:58,101
We're at this lame Christmas party last year,

757
00:33:58,103 --> 00:33:59,403
something for her mom's whatever.

758
00:33:59,405 --> 00:34:01,104
- Nice.
- They finally break out

759
00:34:01,106 --> 00:34:02,672
this karaoke machine, so I start doing

760
00:34:02,674 --> 00:34:05,075
a couple of ll cool j songs.
It was hilarious.

761
00:34:05,077 --> 00:34:07,177
Seriously.
- Honestly, it was awful.

762
00:34:07,179 --> 00:34:08,712
- It was awesome.
Are you kidding?

763
00:34:08,714 --> 00:34:10,313
The early stuff.
Not the later crap.

764
00:34:10,315 --> 00:34:13,617
Anyway, so we get ready to leave at the end of the night

765
00:34:13,619 --> 00:34:15,285
and then Elizabeth here starts dousing

766
00:34:15,287 --> 00:34:17,320
her Debbie downer spray all over the place,

767
00:34:17,322 --> 00:34:19,623
getting on my case about drinking too much,

768
00:34:19,625 --> 00:34:21,525
having too much fun, we gotta call a cab.

769
00:34:21,527 --> 00:34:23,126
So did you?

770
00:34:23,128 --> 00:34:25,662
- No, I didn't call a cab.
She called a cab.

771
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:28,165
But I was fine to drive.
- No, you weren't.

772
00:34:28,167 --> 00:34:29,800
That's why I called the cab.
- Point is

773
00:34:29,802 --> 00:34:32,235
is that she was wrong.
She was wrong about that.

774
00:34:32,237 --> 00:34:34,237
She's wrong about this thing.
She's wrong a lot of the time.

775
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:35,772
I think we get it, okay?

776
00:34:35,774 --> 00:34:38,575
- I think it's cute, though.
- Hey, okay. Um...

777
00:34:38,577 --> 00:34:41,078
How about where I could get a hotel around here.

778
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:43,146
No. You'll just stay
with me and my mom.

779
00:34:43,148 --> 00:34:45,649
Whoa, whoa, we got a big week ahead of us.

780
00:34:45,651 --> 00:34:47,651
We got the wedding.
We got the race.

781
00:34:47,653 --> 00:34:49,219
- What race?
- Jake and I have been training

782
00:34:49,221 --> 00:34:52,122
for this couples marathon for like six months.

783
00:34:52,124 --> 00:34:53,757
- Couples marathon.
- Yeah.

784
00:34:53,759 --> 00:34:55,826
It's a pretty big deal.

785
00:34:55,828 --> 00:34:57,828
They only let like 12 couples even do it.

786
00:34:57,830 --> 00:34:59,830
You should come with us tomorrow.

787
00:34:59,832 --> 00:35:01,498
What, you want him to go to the race too?

788
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,400
Yeah, fine, why don't you come to the bridal shower

789
00:35:03,402 --> 00:35:05,602
while you're at it?
- Well, I don't want to impose.

790
00:35:05,604 --> 00:35:08,805
You're not imposing, and I'm
not gonna take no for an answer.

791
00:35:08,807 --> 00:35:10,574
We have the perfect guest room.

792
00:35:10,576 --> 00:35:12,609
Okay.

793
00:35:12,611 --> 00:35:14,144
And you'll stay for the wedding?

794
00:35:14,146 --> 00:35:16,279
- Sure.
- It's gonna be

795
00:35:16,281 --> 00:35:17,781
just like old times!

796
00:35:17,783 --> 00:35:19,382
- Just like old times.
- Sweetheart,

797
00:35:19,384 --> 00:35:20,851
we really gotta get going.

798
00:35:20,853 --> 00:35:22,419
I have to go see Jake's dad for a couple of things

799
00:35:22,421 --> 00:35:24,588
for the wedding, but I'll see you at the house.

800
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:25,889
Do you remember how to get there?

801
00:35:25,891 --> 00:35:27,524
Yeah, yeah.
It's in the GPS.

802
00:35:27,526 --> 00:35:30,527
- Okay. See you.
- Later, rich.

803
00:35:30,529 --> 00:35:32,796
It's Mitch.

804
00:35:47,879 --> 00:35:50,247
Turn left.

805
00:35:56,587 --> 00:35:59,856
In one mile, turn left.

806
00:36:02,226 --> 00:36:04,794
You have arrived at your destination.

807
00:36:19,178 --> 00:36:22,279
- Yello.
- Yeah, hey, it's me.

808
00:36:22,281 --> 00:36:24,781
- Oh, hey!
- Yeah, good job, nostradamus.

809
00:36:24,783 --> 00:36:27,717
She's getting married in ten days.

810
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:29,252
All right, that's great!

811
00:36:29,254 --> 00:36:30,587
No, not to me.

812
00:36:30,589 --> 00:36:31,821
Oh...

813
00:36:31,823 --> 00:36:32,923
I did not predict that.

814
00:36:32,925 --> 00:36:34,391
Yeah. I got a prediction.

815
00:36:34,393 --> 00:36:36,726
When I get home, I'm gonna--

816
00:36:42,233 --> 00:36:44,501
- Hi.
- Hi, Joyce, how are you?

817
00:36:44,503 --> 00:36:46,236
- Good to see you.
- You too.

818
00:36:46,238 --> 00:36:48,805
Could you please tell my father I'm here to see him?

819
00:36:48,807 --> 00:36:51,541
- Sure.
- Thanks.

820
00:36:51,543 --> 00:36:54,244
Sir, your son is here.

821
00:36:54,246 --> 00:36:57,247
No, he's with Elizabeth.

822
00:36:57,249 --> 00:36:59,849
Oh, okay.

823
00:36:59,851 --> 00:37:01,585
You can go in.
Thanks.

824
00:37:01,587 --> 00:37:03,253
- Thanks.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

825
00:37:03,255 --> 00:37:05,956
He just said Jake, Elizabeth.

826
00:37:05,958 --> 00:37:09,326
Ah. It's okay.
Just go.

827
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:12,362
Damn it.

828
00:37:16,867 --> 00:37:19,236
Didn't I tell you to come alone?

829
00:37:19,238 --> 00:37:20,904
She was with me.
What could I do?

830
00:37:20,906 --> 00:37:23,373
You drop her off at home on the way.

831
00:37:23,375 --> 00:37:25,008
Have a seat.

832
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:30,347
What do you want, dad?

833
00:37:30,349 --> 00:37:33,650
Big Chinese exporter's thinking about hiring this firm.

834
00:37:33,652 --> 00:37:36,419
That's great, but what does that have to do with me?

835
00:37:36,421 --> 00:37:39,289
It always has something to do with you.

836
00:37:39,291 --> 00:37:41,524
Don't you wanna run this firm one day?

837
00:37:41,526 --> 00:37:44,294
Are you thinking about letting me handle the account?

838
00:37:44,296 --> 00:37:47,264
No. What, do you think I'm crazy?

839
00:37:47,266 --> 00:37:49,766
Then why am I here, dad?

840
00:37:49,768 --> 00:37:51,568
- Um...
You and, uh,

841
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:52,869
you and her doing okay?

842
00:37:52,871 --> 00:37:54,337
I mean, the wedding's still on?

843
00:37:54,339 --> 00:37:56,373
Well, if by her you mean Elizabeth,

844
00:37:56,375 --> 00:37:59,476
then the answer's yes, the wedding's still on.

845
00:37:59,478 --> 00:38:01,645
She sign the prenup?

846
00:38:01,647 --> 00:38:03,413
So that's it?

847
00:38:03,415 --> 00:38:05,882
Good old dad looking out for the family interests?

848
00:38:05,884 --> 00:38:07,584
And forget about love,

849
00:38:07,586 --> 00:38:09,853
but let's just make sure the money's safe, right?

850
00:38:09,855 --> 00:38:11,388
Did she sign the prenup?

851
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:14,391
- Yeah.
Yeah, she signed it.

852
00:38:14,393 --> 00:38:16,026
Two days ago.

853
00:38:16,028 --> 00:38:18,895
- Well, that's good, son.
That's good.

854
00:38:18,897 --> 00:38:20,563
I can't afford any--

855
00:38:20,565 --> 00:38:22,599
I mean, we can't afford any problems,

856
00:38:22,601 --> 00:38:24,000
any surprises.

857
00:38:24,002 --> 00:38:26,303
The Chinese believe that a good home life

858
00:38:26,305 --> 00:38:28,605
is essential to a good work life,

859
00:38:28,607 --> 00:38:31,541
and their vetting process is extremely thorough.

860
00:38:31,543 --> 00:38:34,744
Any shenanigans could blow this whole deal,

861
00:38:34,746 --> 00:38:37,380
and we're talking big dollars.

862
00:38:37,382 --> 00:38:39,883
I would appreciate it if you didn't

863
00:38:39,885 --> 00:38:42,585
embarrass your family or this firm.

864
00:38:42,587 --> 00:38:43,853
Not to worry, dad.

865
00:38:43,855 --> 00:38:47,557
I'll do my best not to embarrass you.

866
00:38:47,559 --> 00:38:50,660
Good. Now that we're
on the same page,

867
00:38:50,662 --> 00:38:53,363
you can go.

868
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:02,672
- Is this it right here?
- Yeah, this is it.

869
00:39:02,674 --> 00:39:05,108
Oh, buddy, get down!

870
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:06,843
- Oh, that's okay,
Mrs. Carter.

871
00:39:06,845 --> 00:39:08,645
I'm a dog person.

872
00:39:08,647 --> 00:39:09,846
Good news for you, buddy.

873
00:39:09,848 --> 00:39:11,614
Look,

874
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:12,849
I call you Mitch.

875
00:39:12,851 --> 00:39:14,718
Why don't you just call me Donna?

876
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,519
- Okay. Thank you, Donna.
- You're welcome.

877
00:39:16,521 --> 00:39:18,888
You're welcome. If you need
anything, ask buddy.

878
00:39:19,891 --> 00:39:21,524
- Okay.
- All right?

879
00:39:21,526 --> 00:39:25,662
I'll be right downstairs.
- Thank you.

880
00:39:25,664 --> 00:39:27,530
Hi.

881
00:39:27,532 --> 00:39:29,099
Now what, huh?

882
00:39:37,141 --> 00:39:39,109
You're not gonna say anything

883
00:39:39,111 --> 00:39:41,878
about what just happened in there?

884
00:39:43,681 --> 00:39:45,582
You know, I think it's really ridiculous

885
00:39:45,584 --> 00:39:48,485
that you got this guy staying at your place.

886
00:39:48,487 --> 00:39:49,919
Who, Mitch?

887
00:39:49,921 --> 00:39:51,755
What's wrong with Mitch?

888
00:39:51,757 --> 00:39:54,090
Elizabeth, it's ten days before our wedding.

889
00:39:54,092 --> 00:39:56,426
Now, all of a sudden,
you have some ex-boyfriend--

890
00:39:56,428 --> 00:39:58,094
- he's not my ex-boyfriend.
- That's right.

891
00:39:58,096 --> 00:39:59,562
He's your best friend.

892
00:39:59,564 --> 00:40:01,631
And ten days before our wedding,

893
00:40:01,633 --> 00:40:03,133
he decides to shack up with you at your place?

894
00:40:03,135 --> 00:40:04,734
- Oh, come on.
- Actually, it's not

895
00:40:04,736 --> 00:40:05,869
even your place, though, is it?

896
00:40:05,871 --> 00:40:07,704
It's my place.

897
00:40:07,706 --> 00:40:09,139
I...

898
00:40:09,141 --> 00:40:12,542
I can't believe you would throw that in my face.

899
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:14,110
You knew my mom and I's situation.

900
00:40:14,112 --> 00:40:15,745
You're the one that came up with the idea

901
00:40:15,747 --> 00:40:17,414
for us to live there.

902
00:40:17,416 --> 00:40:19,516
I don't know what your dad said to you up there,

903
00:40:19,518 --> 00:40:22,852
but please stop taking it out on me, okay?

904
00:40:22,854 --> 00:40:24,821
You gonna sign the prenup?

905
00:40:24,823 --> 00:40:26,856
What?

906
00:40:26,858 --> 00:40:28,558
Are you gonna sign the prenup?

907
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:31,060
- Jake, I haven't even
really had a chance to read--

908
00:40:31,062 --> 00:40:33,463
- Elizabeth, I really need you to sign that.

909
00:40:33,465 --> 00:40:35,465
Well, I've had a lot on my mind with the race

910
00:40:35,467 --> 00:40:37,000
and the wedding.
I'm working...

911
00:40:37,002 --> 00:40:38,501
Really? You've had
a lot on your mind?

912
00:40:38,503 --> 00:40:40,136
I've had a lot on my mind too.

913
00:40:40,138 --> 00:40:42,038
I've had the race on my mind, the wedding on my mind.

914
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,706
I have this prenup on my mind

915
00:40:43,708 --> 00:40:45,575
that you seem to never want to talk about.

916
00:40:45,577 --> 00:40:47,444
Now guess what--
now I have Mitch on my mind.

917
00:40:47,446 --> 00:40:48,678
Thanks for that.
Some dweeb I don't even know

918
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:51,181
who's staying with
my-soon-to-be wife

919
00:40:51,183 --> 00:40:53,616
in the house that I paid for.

920
00:40:53,618 --> 00:40:56,052
I really don't want to talk to
you about this right now, okay?

921
00:40:56,054 --> 00:40:58,621
Can you please just take me home?

922
00:40:58,623 --> 00:40:59,722
Fine.

923
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:06,196
I'm sorry.
I love you.

924
00:41:08,499 --> 00:41:10,099
Love you too.

925
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:14,671
Welcome back.

926
00:41:14,673 --> 00:41:18,508
Okay, now there has been a lot of talk about voter fraud,

927
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:21,478
and we are here to discuss--
- Hey, Donna?

928
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,146
- Hey.
- Yeah, I was gonna

929
00:41:23,148 --> 00:41:25,014
go grab a beer.
Is anyplace close by?

930
00:41:25,016 --> 00:41:27,050
Oh. Up the street,
there's lucky's.

931
00:41:27,052 --> 00:41:29,085
Perfect. Can you tell
Elizabeth where I am?

932
00:41:29,087 --> 00:41:31,621
Of course. I think buddy
and I can handle that.

933
00:41:31,623 --> 00:41:32,755
Right, buddy?

934
00:41:32,757 --> 00:41:36,025
Have fun.
- Thank you.

935
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:39,796
- Ooh!

936
00:41:39,798 --> 00:41:41,764
Ah-oh!
- Hey, groin shots

937
00:41:41,766 --> 00:41:43,032
are off-limits.

938
00:41:43,034 --> 00:41:45,502
Anything else is fair game.

939
00:41:45,504 --> 00:41:46,736
Hi.

940
00:41:46,738 --> 00:41:48,037
Hey. What can I get you?

941
00:41:48,039 --> 00:41:50,206
I'll just have a beer, please.

942
00:41:50,208 --> 00:41:51,674
Sure.

943
00:41:56,113 --> 00:41:58,515
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

944
00:41:58,517 --> 00:42:00,283
Would you like to start a tab?

945
00:42:00,285 --> 00:42:02,719
- Sure.
- Aah!

946
00:42:02,721 --> 00:42:03,987
What is that?

947
00:42:03,989 --> 00:42:06,556
It's called the whipping post.

948
00:42:06,558 --> 00:42:08,124
I'll have a beer too.

949
00:42:08,126 --> 00:42:10,560
Put it on this guy's tab.
- Oh!

950
00:42:10,562 --> 00:42:12,829
- Where's Elizabeth?

951
00:42:12,831 --> 00:42:14,063
- I dropped her home.
- Ah.

952
00:42:14,065 --> 00:42:16,099
What are you doing here?

953
00:42:16,101 --> 00:42:18,167
Don't you have a big race tomorrow?

954
00:42:18,169 --> 00:42:20,236
What are you doing here?

955
00:42:20,238 --> 00:42:22,138
I'm just having a beer.

956
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:25,174
<i>No. What are you doing here?</i>

957
00:42:28,078 --> 00:42:32,315
Why would anybody do that to themselves?

958
00:42:32,317 --> 00:42:36,586
I knew you were a wussy from the moment I met you.

959
00:42:36,588 --> 00:42:38,621
- I'm not a wussy.
I'm just not stupid.

960
00:42:38,623 --> 00:42:39,856
Oh, yeah?

961
00:42:39,858 --> 00:42:41,024
Prove it.

962
00:42:41,026 --> 00:42:42,125
No.

963
00:42:42,127 --> 00:42:44,027
See? Wussy.

964
00:42:44,029 --> 00:42:47,964
You actually challenging me to a rat tail competition?

965
00:42:47,966 --> 00:42:49,332
Tell you what.

966
00:42:49,334 --> 00:42:53,636
Bet 1,000 to your 100 you tap out first.

967
00:42:53,638 --> 00:42:57,173
- Hey, everybody.
Jake just bet $1,000 to...

968
00:42:57,175 --> 00:42:58,975
I'm sorry, what's your name?
- Bitch.

969
00:42:58,977 --> 00:43:01,077
- Mitch.
- To Mitch that he can

970
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:03,046
take him in the whipping post!

971
00:43:04,749 --> 00:43:07,283
Whipping post, whipping post!

972
00:43:07,285 --> 00:43:10,253
Whipping post, whipping post,

973
00:43:10,255 --> 00:43:13,289
whipping post, whipping post,

974
00:43:13,291 --> 00:43:15,191
whipping--
- Let's do this.

975
00:43:15,193 --> 00:43:18,361
Whipping post, whipping post!

976
00:43:18,363 --> 00:43:19,896
Whoo!

977
00:43:19,898 --> 00:43:21,230
Let's do it!

978
00:43:21,232 --> 00:43:23,700
Okay, mates, here are the rules.

979
00:43:23,702 --> 00:43:26,836
Trade off whips with your towels until someone taps out.

980
00:43:26,838 --> 00:43:28,671
You tap out, you lose.

981
00:43:28,673 --> 00:43:32,308
No head or groin shots.
Everything else is fair game.

982
00:43:32,310 --> 00:43:34,344
If after five whips there's still no winner,

983
00:43:34,346 --> 00:43:37,714
we dunk those towels in ice water, boys.

984
00:43:37,716 --> 00:43:39,115
Understand?

985
00:43:39,117 --> 00:43:41,084
- Yeah, I understand...
- Yeah, okay.

986
00:43:41,086 --> 00:43:43,052
Let's whip it out, boys.

987
00:43:47,758 --> 00:43:50,693
So, uh, you know, how does this get going here?

988
00:43:50,695 --> 00:43:52,095
Are these regulation towels?

989
00:43:52,097 --> 00:43:53,863
- Oh!
- Ooh!

990
00:43:53,865 --> 00:43:55,365
See that, see that?

991
00:43:55,367 --> 00:43:57,100
Kick his ass, Nate!

992
00:43:57,102 --> 00:43:59,402
- Come on.
- See what you got.

993
00:43:59,404 --> 00:44:02,372
- Ow!

994
00:44:02,374 --> 00:44:04,674
Seems kinda dumb.

995
00:44:07,946 --> 00:44:09,679
- Ah!

996
00:44:09,681 --> 00:44:12,849
- Wanna tap out?
- I'm good.

997
00:44:12,851 --> 00:44:15,785
Okay. Okay.
- Sure you wanna do this,

998
00:44:15,787 --> 00:44:17,687
college friend?

999
00:44:17,689 --> 00:44:20,089
Ow! God!
- Right in the nipple.

1000
00:44:20,091 --> 00:44:22,358
- That's a good shot.
Good shot.

1001
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:24,060
Need a break in this, or what?

1002
00:44:24,062 --> 00:44:25,261
No, we keep going.

1003
00:44:25,263 --> 00:44:27,330
Oh.
- Whoo!

1004
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:31,334
Man, what--

1005
00:44:31,336 --> 00:44:32,802
oh, God!
- Oh!

1006
00:44:32,804 --> 00:44:34,737
- That was right there!
That was--

1007
00:44:34,739 --> 00:44:36,406
- sorry. I don't know.
I've never done it before.

1008
00:44:36,408 --> 00:44:38,307
- Keep your whips up.
- All right, I'll keep it up.

1009
00:44:38,309 --> 00:44:40,743
- Get this guy?
- We keeping score or...

1010
00:44:40,745 --> 00:44:42,779
- Ooh!
- That was a little high.

1011
00:44:42,781 --> 00:44:44,747
No, I know, it's--
- Let's keep it down.

1012
00:44:44,749 --> 00:44:46,149
- You want out?
You good?

1013
00:44:46,151 --> 00:44:47,450
You w-- ow!
Son of a--

1014
00:44:55,325 --> 00:44:57,727
You felt that one, didn't ya?

1015
00:44:58,997 --> 00:45:01,731
Ow! He's hitting
the same spot!

1016
00:45:01,733 --> 00:45:04,033
Come on! Can't he
move it around a little bit?

1017
00:45:04,035 --> 00:45:05,168
- You all right?
- Yeah!

1018
00:45:05,170 --> 00:45:07,336
One-trick pony?

1019
00:45:09,473 --> 00:45:10,840
Oh, what were the rules again?

1020
00:45:10,842 --> 00:45:13,843
Mm!

1021
00:45:36,067 --> 00:45:36,567
Aah!

1022
00:45:41,905 --> 00:45:44,107
These two idiots have actually made it

1023
00:45:44,109 --> 00:45:45,508
to the wet whip.

1024
00:45:45,510 --> 00:45:47,777
It is now time for these two fools

1025
00:45:47,779 --> 00:45:49,479
to whip each other at the same time.

1026
00:45:53,218 --> 00:45:55,818
Just bow out, man.

1027
00:45:55,820 --> 00:45:57,420
- That's not gonna happen.
You bow out.

1028
00:45:57,422 --> 00:45:59,756
- Let's go.
Come on.

1029
00:46:05,496 --> 00:46:08,131
Okay, let's whip it out, boys.

1030
00:46:08,133 --> 00:46:10,233
Let's whip it out.

1031
00:46:12,003 --> 00:46:13,069
- Hey!

1032
00:46:13,071 --> 00:46:14,470
Are you both crazy?

1033
00:46:14,472 --> 00:46:16,372
That's it.
Show's over.

1034
00:46:16,374 --> 00:46:18,908
- Boo!
- Come on!

1035
00:46:18,910 --> 00:46:20,510
What were you both thinking?

1036
00:46:20,512 --> 00:46:23,146
Talk about this tomorrow?

1037
00:46:23,148 --> 00:46:25,214
I'm good with that.

1038
00:46:25,216 --> 00:46:26,549
I'm taking Mitch home.

1039
00:46:26,551 --> 00:46:28,484
And I'm gonna see you
at 10:00 A.M.

1040
00:46:28,486 --> 00:46:30,853
What is that, your mom?
Ha ha ha!

1041
00:46:30,855 --> 00:46:34,323
Come on!
- You had him, Jake.

1042
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,261
Thanks.

1043
00:46:38,263 --> 00:46:40,530
Somebody should tend to those wounds,

1044
00:46:40,532 --> 00:46:43,499
but you're definitely too drunk to drive.

1045
00:46:44,568 --> 00:46:46,903
You got any suggestions?

1046
00:46:46,905 --> 00:46:48,404
I live right upstairs.

1047
00:46:48,406 --> 00:46:50,506

Ohh...
Oh!

1054
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:04,420
Gah!
Ah!

1055
00:47:07,391 --> 00:47:09,258
What the hell were you thinking?

1056
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:10,860
Do you need some help?

1057
00:47:10,862 --> 00:47:12,328
If you've come to yell at me,

1058
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:13,896
I think I'm suffering enough as it is.

1059
00:47:13,898 --> 00:47:16,232
I'm not gonna yell at you.

1060
00:47:16,234 --> 00:47:18,267
- Here.
- What the hell

1061
00:47:18,269 --> 00:47:20,036
were you thinking?
- Oh, my gosh.

1062
00:47:20,038 --> 00:47:22,038
Oh...

1063
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:23,105
Ah!
- I'm sorry.

1064
00:47:23,107 --> 00:47:24,407
Ow...

1065
00:47:24,409 --> 00:47:26,275
Oh, my gosh!

1066
00:47:26,277 --> 00:47:28,144
Where did you find this?

1067
00:47:28,146 --> 00:47:30,112
Oh. Friggin' Dave.

1068
00:47:30,114 --> 00:47:33,883
He was busting my balls about that, so...

1069
00:47:33,885 --> 00:47:35,885
You ate so many hot dogs that day.

1070
00:47:35,887 --> 00:47:39,055
27. I remember
every one of them.

1071
00:47:39,057 --> 00:47:40,389
I ate a lot too.

1072
00:47:40,391 --> 00:47:42,925
If memory serves, you had three.

1073
00:47:42,927 --> 00:47:44,460
- Three is a lot.
- Three's a lot?

1074
00:47:44,462 --> 00:47:46,429
Yes. I mean, not as many
as 27, but...

1075
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:48,264
Well, no, yeah, look at my face,

1076
00:47:48,266 --> 00:47:50,166
and, you know, look at yours.

1077
00:47:50,168 --> 00:47:52,602
We're babies.

1078
00:47:52,604 --> 00:47:54,170
Okay. I'm off to bed.

1079
00:47:54,172 --> 00:47:56,906
Good night.

1080
00:47:56,908 --> 00:47:59,108
Good night.

1081
00:48:04,448 --> 00:48:07,283
Hey.
Don't you judge me.

1082
00:48:10,922 --> 00:48:12,655
You wanna sleep together?

1083
00:48:15,392 --> 00:48:16,993
- College.
- College.

1084
00:48:24,334 --> 00:48:28,004
- Come on, open!

1085
00:48:36,013 --> 00:48:37,680
Hi.

1086
00:48:39,182 --> 00:48:40,950
Hi.

1087
00:48:40,952 --> 00:48:42,285
I can't get my door open.

1088
00:48:42,287 --> 00:48:44,220
You think you could help me out?

1089
00:48:44,222 --> 00:48:46,422
Your door...

1090
00:48:49,393 --> 00:48:51,494
Oh, that's nice.

1091
00:48:51,496 --> 00:48:55,064
- Yeah, it's stuck.
- Um...

1092
00:48:55,066 --> 00:48:57,099
Your door's stuck.
Yeah, let me, uh,

1093
00:48:57,101 --> 00:48:58,200
let me take a look.

1094
00:49:00,971 --> 00:49:02,305
All runners should be making your way

1095
00:49:02,307 --> 00:49:04,006
to registration now.

1096
00:49:06,210 --> 00:49:08,044
He said 10:00 A.M.

1097
00:49:08,046 --> 00:49:09,378
Right?

1098
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:11,080
Yeah.

1099
00:49:11,082 --> 00:49:12,982
Maybe he got held up.

1100
00:49:12,984 --> 00:49:15,351
I don't know, but I can't wait for him anymore.

1101
00:49:15,353 --> 00:49:16,652
I'm gonna go register, okay?

1102
00:49:16,654 --> 00:49:19,722
We'll be right here, honey.

1103
00:49:21,224 --> 00:49:23,359
Donna, what's the deal with this guy?

1104
00:49:23,361 --> 00:49:25,261
I don't know.

1105
00:49:25,263 --> 00:49:28,698
Oh, Mitch, I don't know.

1106
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:31,233
Speak of the devil...

1107
00:49:33,504 --> 00:49:35,037
Hey!

1108
00:49:35,039 --> 00:49:37,273
Hey, where have you been?

1109
00:49:37,275 --> 00:49:40,176
And what-- why aren't you
dressed for the race?

1110
00:49:40,178 --> 00:49:42,144
- What-- what?

1111
00:49:42,146 --> 00:49:43,612
Oh, my God!

1112
00:49:43,614 --> 00:49:46,582
Are you drunk?
- No, I'm not drunk.

1113
00:49:46,584 --> 00:49:49,485
I was drunk.
I'm just hung over now.

1114
00:49:49,487 --> 00:49:51,320
Mitch, could you grab his stuff?

1115
00:49:51,322 --> 00:49:53,222
- Hey, don't-- don't--
don't touch my stuff, bro.

1116
00:49:53,224 --> 00:49:54,557
All right?

1117
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:57,360
If she sees you like this, it will kill her.

1118
00:49:57,362 --> 00:49:59,061
Relax, Donna.

1119
00:49:59,063 --> 00:50:00,663
Give me a break.
Where is she?

1120
00:50:00,665 --> 00:50:02,164
She's at registration.

1121
00:50:02,166 --> 00:50:03,499
Hey, I wasn't talking to you, dirt bag!

1122
00:50:03,501 --> 00:50:04,667
You know, we could finish

1123
00:50:04,669 --> 00:50:06,669
what we started last night if you want.

1124
00:50:06,671 --> 00:50:08,471
- All right,
let's go, 12-step.

1125
00:50:08,473 --> 00:50:10,272
Oh, great.

1126
00:50:10,274 --> 00:50:13,442
That's what I thought.

1127
00:50:13,444 --> 00:50:15,211
Let's do this thing.

1128
00:50:15,213 --> 00:50:16,479
Ow! Ow!
- Nate--

1129
00:50:18,349 --> 00:50:20,182
Get away from me!

1130
00:50:20,184 --> 00:50:21,384
Ah... Uh...

1131
00:50:21,386 --> 00:50:22,718
I'll go find a doctor.

1132
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:25,021
- What happened?
- You do that!

1133
00:50:25,023 --> 00:50:26,489
Whatever happens, do not tell Elizabeth

1134
00:50:26,491 --> 00:50:28,224
you've been drinking.

1135
00:50:28,226 --> 00:50:30,593
- Just quit yelling at me!
God, I have a headache!

1136
00:50:30,595 --> 00:50:33,362
- Good luck to you.
- Thank you.

1137
00:50:33,364 --> 00:50:34,730
- Hi.
- Hi.

1138
00:50:34,732 --> 00:50:37,433
- Team name.
- Welcome back, Carter.

1139
00:50:37,435 --> 00:50:38,567
Okay.

1140
00:50:38,569 --> 00:50:39,735
Here you go.
These are for you.

1141
00:50:39,737 --> 00:50:41,103
- Thanks.
- I'll see you

1142
00:50:41,105 --> 00:50:42,772
at the starting line.
- Okay.

1143
00:50:42,774 --> 00:50:45,307
- Next.
Team name.

1144
00:50:45,309 --> 00:50:49,145
- I'm not gonna be too sure
until I look at some x-rays.

1145
00:50:49,147 --> 00:50:52,481
But what I see so far looks like a high ankle sprain.

1146
00:50:52,483 --> 00:50:54,250
Ow! Ow!

1147
00:50:54,252 --> 00:50:56,685
Oh, no, what happened?

1148
00:50:59,122 --> 00:51:00,790
Speak.

1149
00:51:00,792 --> 00:51:02,591
- I-it was a freak
accident, babe.

1150
00:51:02,593 --> 00:51:05,194
I stepped out of the car and I rolled my ankle.

1151
00:51:05,196 --> 00:51:07,063
Is that the truth?

1152
00:51:08,398 --> 00:51:09,632
Mitch.

1153
00:51:09,634 --> 00:51:13,402
It's pretty much what I saw.

1154
00:51:14,838 --> 00:51:16,505
Do you think there's any possibility

1155
00:51:16,507 --> 00:51:18,207
of him running today?
- Babe, he's a doctor.

1156
00:51:18,209 --> 00:51:19,809
I can't run.
- Like I say,

1157
00:51:19,811 --> 00:51:21,377
I gotta look at some x-rays.

1158
00:51:21,379 --> 00:51:22,678
So that's it?

1159
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:25,147
What about Mrs. Stanton
and her kids?

1160
00:51:25,149 --> 00:51:26,682
I think the pledges will understand.

1161
00:51:26,684 --> 00:51:28,417
Final call for registration.

1162
00:51:28,419 --> 00:51:30,553
I don't think so.

1163
00:51:30,555 --> 00:51:32,421
Well, we're not gonna find out,

1164
00:51:32,423 --> 00:51:35,157
'cause I'll run.

1165
00:51:35,159 --> 00:51:37,393
- What?
- If you'll have me.

1166
00:51:37,395 --> 00:51:39,695
I will so have you.

1167
00:51:40,530 --> 00:51:42,465
Can you handle Jake?

1168
00:51:42,467 --> 00:51:44,133
Mitch and I have a race to run.

1169
00:51:44,135 --> 00:51:45,701
- Wait, whoa--
wait, wait, wait--

1170
00:51:45,703 --> 00:51:47,603
- go get 'em, guys.
- Wait, I--

1171
00:51:47,605 --> 00:51:50,306
- shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

1172
00:51:51,208 --> 00:51:52,741
- Ow!
- All couples should be

1173
00:51:52,743 --> 00:51:54,543
making their way to the starting line.

1174
00:51:54,545 --> 00:51:56,112
I got it, I got it.

1175
00:51:58,748 --> 00:52:00,783
How long is this thing anyway?

1176
00:52:00,785 --> 00:52:02,318
Probably best if you don't know.

1177
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:03,853
Just remember, keep an even pace

1178
00:52:03,855 --> 00:52:05,421
and remember that you're doing it

1179
00:52:05,423 --> 00:52:06,689
for Mrs. Stanton and her kids.

1180
00:52:06,691 --> 00:52:08,791
Mrs. Stanton
and her kids. Right.

1181
00:52:08,793 --> 00:52:11,393
Okay. This gonna
mess up my pedicure?

1182
00:52:11,395 --> 00:52:14,163
The Pasadena couples marathon is about to begin.

1183
00:52:14,165 --> 00:52:16,398
I should have gone to the bathroom first, right?

1184
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:19,668
Ladies and gentlemen, do not break your connection,

1185
00:52:19,670 --> 00:52:21,270
or you will be disqualified.

1186
00:52:21,272 --> 00:52:24,874
Also, make sure you stay in the course,

1187
00:52:24,876 --> 00:52:26,709
especially when you hit trail hill.

1188
00:52:26,711 --> 00:52:29,645
- Trail what?
- Shh!

1189
00:52:29,647 --> 00:52:31,313
- There-- there's a hill?

1190
00:52:31,315 --> 00:52:34,583
In your position.

1191
00:52:34,585 --> 00:52:36,685
On your marks...

1192
00:52:36,687 --> 00:52:38,387

Donna, I can do it by myself, all right?

1202
00:53:13,724 --> 00:53:16,258
- Oh, shut up.
I'm helping.

1203
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:18,594
I can't believe she's running that race with Mitch.

1204
00:53:18,596 --> 00:53:20,763
I bet they don't even finish.

1205
00:53:20,765 --> 00:53:22,198
- Oh, ho!
She will.

1206
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:24,900

- I know.
Crazy, right?

1224
00:54:11,682 --> 00:54:14,683
Yeah. Well, we have
checkpoints all over this place.

1225
00:54:14,685 --> 00:54:16,252
If they were to have quit,

1226
00:54:16,254 --> 00:54:17,853
we would have found out by now.

1227
00:54:21,591 --> 00:54:23,492
Come on, baby!

1228
00:54:23,494 --> 00:54:24,827
Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo!

1229
00:54:24,829 --> 00:54:26,362
Come on, baby!

1230
00:54:26,364 --> 00:54:29,031
- Oh, wow.
- Whoo, whoo, whoo.

1231
00:54:29,033 --> 00:54:31,367
Are you all right?
Are you all right?

1232
00:54:31,369 --> 00:54:32,868
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1233
00:54:32,870 --> 00:54:35,337
- Oh, my gosh.
- Hey, hey.

1234
00:54:35,339 --> 00:54:36,739
You okay?
- Oh, my gosh!

1235
00:54:36,741 --> 00:54:39,341
Should we call an ambulance?
Oh!

1236
00:54:39,343 --> 00:54:41,310
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

1237
00:54:41,312 --> 00:54:42,645
Put your arm around me.
Hold on.

1238
00:54:42,647 --> 00:54:45,314
Oh, look at this.
Oh, my God!

1239
00:54:45,316 --> 00:54:47,716
- Go, Lizzie!
- You all right?

1240
00:54:47,718 --> 00:54:51,353
- Mitch!
Here, sweetheart.

1241
00:54:51,355 --> 00:54:52,988
Oh, my God.

1242
00:54:52,990 --> 00:54:55,491
You okay?
Come on.

1243
00:54:59,329 --> 00:55:01,463
As I get closer and closer to Elizabeth,

1244
00:55:01,465 --> 00:55:07,436
I'm beginning to feel more and more confident about this.

1245
00:55:07,438 --> 00:55:09,838
Morning, sunshine.

1246
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:11,907
Good morning, mommy.

1247
00:55:11,909 --> 00:55:13,676
Mommy?

1248
00:55:13,678 --> 00:55:16,512
- You're not my mom!
- Mm-mm.

1249
00:55:16,514 --> 00:55:18,314
Good thing.

1250
00:55:18,316 --> 00:55:20,783
- Oh.
Oh, God, it hurts to move.

1251
00:55:20,785 --> 00:55:22,451
I figured it would.

1252
00:55:22,453 --> 00:55:24,920
That way, you can't kick me out.

1253
00:55:26,490 --> 00:55:28,824
Doesn't it remind you of when we were camping?

1254
00:55:28,826 --> 00:55:32,328
I could stay here all day.

1255
00:55:32,330 --> 00:55:34,630
I don't think I have a choice.

1256
00:55:38,769 --> 00:55:41,403
I think I left my credit card at the bar the other night.

1257
00:55:41,405 --> 00:55:42,638
Lizzie!

1258
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:44,406
Are you up?
- Uh, yeah.

1259
00:55:44,408 --> 00:55:47,810
Just got a call from the wedding photographer.

1260
00:55:47,812 --> 00:55:48,877
He needs to change his appointment

1261
00:55:48,879 --> 00:55:50,979
to 10:30 A.M. tomorrow.

1262
00:55:50,981 --> 00:55:54,450
- Okay. Thank you.
- You're welcome!

1263
00:55:54,452 --> 00:55:57,519
I actually forgot I had that appointment today.

1264
00:56:00,890 --> 00:56:03,592
I'm sorry, Liz, I have to ask.

1265
00:56:03,594 --> 00:56:05,127
Yes?

1266
00:56:05,129 --> 00:56:07,896
Why are you marrying this guy?

1267
00:56:10,567 --> 00:56:11,767
Excuse me?

1268
00:56:11,769 --> 00:56:14,069
No, I'm just saying, it's...

1269
00:56:14,071 --> 00:56:16,805
From what I've seen, you're not very happy with him.

1270
00:56:16,807 --> 00:56:18,607
And if you don't mind me saying,

1271
00:56:18,609 --> 00:56:20,476
he's kind of a dick.

1272
00:56:20,478 --> 00:56:21,810
Wow.

1273
00:56:21,812 --> 00:56:24,380
What, you disagree?

1274
00:56:24,382 --> 00:56:26,482
What would you like for me to do, Mitch?

1275
00:56:26,484 --> 00:56:29,585
Do you want me to dump Jake and marry you?

1276
00:56:31,722 --> 00:56:33,021
And who do you think you are,

1277
00:56:33,023 --> 00:56:34,723
you're gonna come here after ten years

1278
00:56:34,725 --> 00:56:35,924
and you're gonna judge me?

1279
00:56:35,926 --> 00:56:37,793
- Wait a second.
For-- ow.

1280
00:56:37,795 --> 00:56:39,461
For your information,

1281
00:56:39,463 --> 00:56:40,829
I barely made it through Texas

1282
00:56:40,831 --> 00:56:42,164
coming out here to find you.

1283
00:56:42,166 --> 00:56:43,932
If I want to judge, I'll judge!

1284
00:56:43,934 --> 00:56:45,667
Okay, now we're gonna play that card?

1285
00:56:45,669 --> 00:56:47,770
The "I worked so hard to find you"?

1286
00:56:47,772 --> 00:56:48,904
Come on, give me a break.

1287
00:56:48,906 --> 00:56:50,072
It's no card.

1288
00:56:50,074 --> 00:56:52,908
- Fine.
I'll bite.

1289
00:56:52,910 --> 00:56:56,145
- Laura!

1290
00:56:56,147 --> 00:56:59,148
There he is.

1291
00:56:59,150 --> 00:57:01,150
- Hey, Rudy--
- Come here, you!

1292
00:57:01,152 --> 00:57:02,985
Bring it in.
Bring it in.

1293
00:57:02,987 --> 00:57:07,156
So... I heard you're spending
the night at my sister's.

1294
00:57:07,158 --> 00:57:09,525
- Uh, yes, sir.
- Did you have sex with her yet?

1295
00:57:09,527 --> 00:57:10,726
- Rudy!
- Sorry.

1296
00:57:10,728 --> 00:57:13,028
I'm just kidding.
But I heard she's good.

1297
00:57:13,030 --> 00:57:14,563
I'm just kidding!

1298
00:57:14,565 --> 00:57:16,899
Hey, would you like to hang out with us a bit?

1299
00:57:16,901 --> 00:57:19,101
Me and my boys, we're gonna be hanging around the fire,

1300
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:21,103
saying a couple chants.

1301
00:57:21,105 --> 00:57:23,172
What kinda chants?

1302
00:57:23,174 --> 00:57:26,842
Well, number one,
our lord and savior, J.C.

1303
00:57:26,844 --> 00:57:27,910
J...

1304
00:57:27,912 --> 00:57:29,545
Jesus Christ.

1305
00:57:29,547 --> 00:57:31,146
Right.

1306
00:57:31,148 --> 00:57:33,515
Can I ask what the bonfire's about?

1307
00:57:33,517 --> 00:57:36,919
I mean, don't you guys
usually burn... crosses?

1308
00:57:36,921 --> 00:57:38,854
Whoa, whoa.

1309
00:57:38,856 --> 00:57:41,657
Who do you think we are?

1310
00:57:41,659 --> 00:57:43,192
K.K.K.?

1311
00:57:43,194 --> 00:57:45,194
What would make you say that?

1312
00:57:45,196 --> 00:57:47,596
It might have something to do with the white robes.

1313
00:57:47,598 --> 00:57:49,064
- Laura, first of all,
they're not white--

1314
00:57:49,066 --> 00:57:50,766
they're taupe.

1315
00:57:50,768 --> 00:57:52,935
You've heard of the hell's angels?

1316
00:57:52,937 --> 00:57:54,503
- Of course.
- Well, they are

1317
00:57:54,505 --> 00:57:55,904
the heaven's angels.

1318
00:57:55,906 --> 00:57:57,773
- Oh...
- We're a small group,

1319
00:57:57,775 --> 00:57:59,208
but we're growing fast.

1320
00:57:59,210 --> 00:58:01,643
The robes are what they call angel shrouds.

1321
00:58:01,645 --> 00:58:04,947
Yo, Rudy, the boys are getting restless waiting on you.

1322
00:58:04,949 --> 00:58:06,782
How much longer we gotta wait?

1323
00:58:06,784 --> 00:58:10,686
Would you like to join us for our ceremony this evening?

1324
00:58:10,688 --> 00:58:12,221
If I refuse?

1325
00:58:12,223 --> 00:58:14,623
I'll just have the boys come over and, uh,

1326
00:58:14,625 --> 00:58:17,893
they'll just kick the snot outta you.

1327
00:58:17,895 --> 00:58:19,127
Let's chant!

1328
00:58:19,129 --> 00:58:20,762
All right, well, you boys have fun.

1329
00:58:20,764 --> 00:58:22,831
I'm outta here.
- You're going?

1330
00:58:22,833 --> 00:58:24,833
Oh, yeah.

1331
00:58:24,835 --> 00:58:26,702
- Let's go.
- Okay.

1332
00:58:26,704 --> 00:58:28,237
Yeah. A biker gang

1333
00:58:28,239 --> 00:58:30,506
called the heaven's angels in Texas?

1334
00:58:30,508 --> 00:58:32,174
That's ridiculous.

1335
00:58:32,176 --> 00:58:34,276
Rudy turned out to be a really nice guy.

1336
00:58:34,278 --> 00:58:35,978
He gave me his card.
- You know what?

1337
00:58:35,980 --> 00:58:38,013
Jake proposed to me, I said yes,

1338
00:58:38,015 --> 00:58:39,915
and we're getting married.

1339
00:58:39,917 --> 00:58:41,750
- Well, great.
Good. Fine.

1340
00:58:41,752 --> 00:58:43,652
Good for you!

1341
00:58:45,622 --> 00:58:46,722
You know...

1342
00:58:46,724 --> 00:58:48,123
Buddy!

1343
00:58:48,125 --> 00:58:50,959
Come on, let's wake Mitch up!

1344
00:58:50,961 --> 00:58:52,694
- Wait-- no, bu-- no.

1345
00:58:52,696 --> 00:58:53,695
Buddy, n-n--

1346
00:58:53,697 --> 00:58:54,863
Aah!

1347
00:59:01,538 --> 00:59:03,605
- Excuse me.
- Oh, hey, man.

1348
00:59:03,607 --> 00:59:05,641
Sorry. We don't open
for another hour.

1349
00:59:05,643 --> 00:59:07,643
- Yeah, I know.
I was in here the other night.

1350
00:59:07,645 --> 00:59:09,077
I think I left my credit card.

1351
00:59:09,079 --> 00:59:11,179
I was...
Playing the, uh,

1352
00:59:11,181 --> 00:59:12,981
whipping post.
- Yes!

1353
00:59:12,983 --> 00:59:14,783
I remember you!

1354
00:59:14,785 --> 00:59:16,084
You're awesome!

1355
00:59:16,086 --> 00:59:17,252
- Thank you.
- Yeah. No, man,

1356
00:59:17,254 --> 00:59:19,721
you're one tough son of a bitch!

1357
00:59:19,723 --> 00:59:22,291
Thank you.

1358
00:59:22,293 --> 00:59:24,693
Uh, the credit card.
- Oh, you don't just like

1359
00:59:24,695 --> 00:59:26,228
staring at each other awkwardly.

1360
00:59:26,230 --> 00:59:28,597
Sorry. I'll be right back.
- Thank you.

1361
00:59:28,599 --> 00:59:30,666
I'll call you later.

1362
00:59:37,006 --> 00:59:38,974
What are you doing here?

1363
00:59:38,976 --> 00:59:40,842
Picking up my credit card.

1364
00:59:40,844 --> 00:59:42,978
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

1365
00:59:42,980 --> 00:59:45,147
Nothin'.

1366
00:59:45,149 --> 00:59:48,016
I don't know what you think you saw here,

1367
00:59:48,018 --> 00:59:51,053
but, uh...
You didn't see anything.

1368
00:59:51,055 --> 00:59:53,622
Didn't say I did.

1369
00:59:53,624 --> 00:59:55,591
Good.

1370
00:59:59,296 --> 01:00:01,630
Mr. Mitch Becker...

1371
01:00:01,632 --> 01:00:03,632
Here you go.
- Thank you.

1372
01:00:03,634 --> 01:00:07,102
Oh, and on tabs this high, we automatically add 20%.

1373
01:00:08,972 --> 01:00:11,673
- You have a pen?
- Probably.

1374
01:00:21,218 --> 01:00:24,152
I only got a few minutes, whoever you are.

1375
01:00:24,154 --> 01:00:25,220
I-- oh.

1376
01:00:25,222 --> 01:00:27,923
- Hello, Donna.
- Stanley Jones.

1377
01:00:27,925 --> 01:00:29,825
What brings you out here?

1378
01:00:29,827 --> 01:00:31,727
Well, for starters, I was hoping

1379
01:00:31,729 --> 01:00:36,865
that you would fix me one of
your delicious cups of coffee.

1380
01:00:36,867 --> 01:00:38,867
The house looks great.

1381
01:00:38,869 --> 01:00:40,902
Thank you.

1382
01:00:40,904 --> 01:00:42,337
How's Elizabeth?

1383
01:00:42,339 --> 01:00:45,974
I understand that she has an old friend in town visiting.

1384
01:00:45,976 --> 01:00:48,944
Oh, Mitch. He drove all
the way from Boston to see her.

1385
01:00:48,946 --> 01:00:50,312
She's so excited.

1386
01:00:50,314 --> 01:00:53,015
They haven't seen each other since college.

1387
01:00:53,017 --> 01:00:55,951
How heartwarming.

1388
01:00:55,953 --> 01:01:00,322
You've never been good at smalltalk, Stan.

1389
01:01:00,324 --> 01:01:02,224
Why are you here?

1390
01:01:02,226 --> 01:01:03,792
I just wanna make sure

1391
01:01:03,794 --> 01:01:06,294
that she's going forward with this wedding.

1392
01:01:06,296 --> 01:01:08,697
Well, of course she is.

1393
01:01:08,699 --> 01:01:10,365
Why would you--

1394
01:01:10,367 --> 01:01:11,933
you don't think--

1395
01:01:11,935 --> 01:01:14,436
Oh, Stan!

1396
01:01:14,438 --> 01:01:16,171
They're just friends.

1397
01:01:16,173 --> 01:01:19,307
Trust me.
You have nothing to worry about.

1398
01:01:19,309 --> 01:01:20,809
You're right, Donna.

1399
01:01:20,811 --> 01:01:22,310
I'm not very good at small talk.

1400
01:01:22,312 --> 01:01:25,414
I want your assurance that my son's wedding

1401
01:01:25,416 --> 01:01:27,849
is gonna go off without a hitch.

1402
01:01:27,851 --> 01:01:30,052
It would be a shame if I had to...

1403
01:01:30,054 --> 01:01:33,922
Sell certain assets in order to make up my losses.

1404
01:01:35,224 --> 01:01:37,726
Well, let me be perfectly clear.

1405
01:01:37,728 --> 01:01:40,962
You can be well assured that the wedding will go on

1406
01:01:40,964 --> 01:01:42,898
as planned.

1407
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:46,168
Thank you.
I can get the key in,

1408
01:01:46,170 --> 01:01:47,769
but then when I turn it--
oh!

1409
01:01:47,771 --> 01:01:51,206
Just the new paint sticking to the door.

1410
01:01:51,208 --> 01:01:53,308
- Thank you.

1411
01:01:53,310 --> 01:01:55,143
Oh, I'm Elizabeth Carter.

1412
01:01:55,145 --> 01:01:57,079
Hi, Elizabeth.

1413
01:01:57,081 --> 01:01:59,247
- And you are...
- Oh.

1414
01:01:59,249 --> 01:02:02,317
I'm bitch maker.
Mitch. Becker.

1415
01:02:02,319 --> 01:02:04,286
- Fourth floor.
What the hell?

1416
01:02:04,288 --> 01:02:05,921
Hey, roomie.
- Hi.

1417
01:02:05,923 --> 01:02:07,923
Mm.

1418
01:02:07,925 --> 01:02:11,793
Uh, well, I'll leave you two alone.

1419
01:02:11,795 --> 01:02:14,229
You know, we should hang out some time.

1420
01:02:14,231 --> 01:02:15,464
- Gr-oss!

1421
01:02:17,066 --> 01:02:18,366
That'd be great.

1422
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:21,203
See ya.
- Yeah.

1423
01:02:21,205 --> 01:02:23,071
Bye.

1424
01:02:24,941 --> 01:02:26,808
Bye.

1425
01:02:31,882 --> 01:02:34,416
What happened to you, man?

1426
01:02:34,418 --> 01:02:36,818
Oh, I just fell in love.

1427
01:02:36,820 --> 01:02:39,321
I just got high in the quad.

1428
01:02:39,323 --> 01:02:41,356
- College.
- College.

1429
01:02:47,363 --> 01:02:50,065
- Hey, hey.
- Hey.

1430
01:02:50,067 --> 01:02:52,134
Somebody had a long day at work, huh?

1431
01:02:52,136 --> 01:02:54,803
- Yes.
- Care to join me?

1432
01:02:54,805 --> 01:02:56,872
You know I hate drinking alone.

1433
01:02:56,874 --> 01:02:58,073
Sure.

1434
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:05,413
Here you go.

1435
01:03:05,415 --> 01:03:07,916
- Thank you.
- Cheers.

1436
01:03:13,422 --> 01:03:16,391
Listen, Elizabeth, I want to apologize

1437
01:03:16,393 --> 01:03:18,460
for the way...
- No, Mitch, honestly,

1438
01:03:18,462 --> 01:03:20,896
I'm the one that owes the apology.

1439
01:03:20,898 --> 01:03:23,431
After I thought about it, I can totally understand

1440
01:03:23,433 --> 01:03:25,000
why you felt that way about Jake.

1441
01:03:25,002 --> 01:03:26,434
- Listen, I don't even know him--

1442
01:03:26,436 --> 01:03:28,136
- no, no, just...

1443
01:03:28,138 --> 01:03:29,471
Let me finish, okay?

1444
01:03:29,473 --> 01:03:32,340
This is kind of difficult for me to say.

1445
01:03:34,310 --> 01:03:37,412
My parents always thought that they'd retired here.

1446
01:03:37,414 --> 01:03:39,447
And then my dad died suddenly,

1447
01:03:39,449 --> 01:03:42,851
and both of us were really devastated.

1448
01:03:42,853 --> 01:03:45,053
Six months later, I'm living in Los Angeles

1449
01:03:45,055 --> 01:03:47,222
and I'm about to get married, and then that didn't happen

1450
01:03:47,224 --> 01:03:50,492
because I found my fiance in bed with my best friend.

1451
01:03:50,494 --> 01:03:53,428
My life was kinda going nowhere.

1452
01:03:53,430 --> 01:03:56,097
I felt like... Felt like
I needed to move home,

1453
01:03:56,099 --> 01:03:57,432
and then once I got here,

1454
01:03:57,434 --> 01:04:00,268
I found out my mom was about to lose the house.

1455
01:04:00,270 --> 01:04:04,506
She got caught up in one of those refinancing schemes,

1456
01:04:04,508 --> 01:04:08,043
and she had no choice but to sell or be foreclosed.

1457
01:04:08,045 --> 01:04:12,180
- Mm. Wow.
- That's when I met Jake.

1458
01:04:12,182 --> 01:04:14,282
He came to look at the house

1459
01:04:14,284 --> 01:04:17,919
and pretty soon realized that
all he could do was look at me.

1460
01:04:17,921 --> 01:04:20,222
I know it sounds really silly,

1461
01:04:20,224 --> 01:04:22,190
but after what I had been through,

1462
01:04:22,192 --> 01:04:25,493
it felt really nice.

1463
01:04:25,495 --> 01:04:28,964
We went to dinner.
I explained our situation.

1464
01:04:28,966 --> 01:04:31,166
And shortly after that, he bought the house

1465
01:04:31,168 --> 01:04:33,068
and said that we could stay.

1466
01:04:33,070 --> 01:04:34,402
For free?

1467
01:04:34,404 --> 01:04:38,206
His family has a lot of money.

1468
01:04:38,208 --> 01:04:39,608
- Ah, I see.
For free

1469
01:04:39,610 --> 01:04:41,977
as long as the two of you are together.

1470
01:04:41,979 --> 01:04:44,446
It's really not like that.

1471
01:04:44,448 --> 01:04:48,350
He proposed.
I said yes.

1472
01:04:48,352 --> 01:04:51,052
And here we are.

1473
01:04:53,356 --> 01:04:56,558
What can I say about that?

1474
01:04:56,560 --> 01:04:59,895
I guess I don't really need you to say anything.

1475
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:06,201
Thank you.

1476
01:05:46,409 --> 01:05:47,609
- Woman--
- Shh.

1477
01:05:47,611 --> 01:05:49,244
- Potter residence.
- Hey, Donna,

1478
01:05:49,246 --> 01:05:52,447
is Elizabeth there?
- Oh, good morning, Jake.

1479
01:05:52,449 --> 01:05:55,016
I think she's awake-- she must be
around here somewhere.

1480
01:05:55,018 --> 01:05:57,986
Let me try and fi--
it's for you.

1481
01:05:57,988 --> 01:05:59,454
Hey, you.

1482
01:05:59,456 --> 01:06:01,089
- Hello, sweetheart.
Look, I'm sorry,

1483
01:06:01,091 --> 01:06:02,691
but I'm not gonna be able to make

1484
01:06:02,693 --> 01:06:06,294
that photographer appointment this morning.

1485
01:06:06,296 --> 01:06:07,529
Uh...

1486
01:06:07,531 --> 01:06:09,597
Is-- okay.
Is everything all right?

1487
01:06:09,599 --> 01:06:11,032
No, everything's fine,

1488
01:06:11,034 --> 01:06:12,367
but my dad just wants to show me

1489
01:06:12,369 --> 01:06:14,169
this building he's thinking of purchasing.

1490
01:06:14,171 --> 01:06:16,538
You mind going on your own?
- I would like for you

1491
01:06:16,540 --> 01:06:18,406
to be there, but if you can't,

1492
01:06:18,408 --> 01:06:20,275
I can do it by myself.

1493
01:06:20,277 --> 01:06:21,543
That's my girl.

1494
01:06:21,545 --> 01:06:25,146
Okay. I'll see you
when I get back.

1495
01:06:27,049 --> 01:06:28,616
What now?

1496
01:06:28,618 --> 01:06:30,218
Jake has to go meet his dad,

1497
01:06:30,220 --> 01:06:33,655
so I get to go to the photographer by myself.

1498
01:06:33,657 --> 01:06:36,057
- Want me to go with you?
- No.

1499
01:06:36,059 --> 01:06:38,360
I'm okay.
Thank you.

1500
01:06:38,362 --> 01:06:40,028
Pretty please?

1501
01:06:40,030 --> 01:06:43,331
No. Let me read you
your horoscope instead.

1502
01:06:43,333 --> 01:06:46,034
- Oh, please.
- Leo.

1503
01:06:57,213 --> 01:06:58,413
Good morning.

1504
01:06:58,415 --> 01:07:00,248
Good morning.

1505
01:07:00,250 --> 01:07:02,017
Um...

1506
01:07:02,019 --> 01:07:03,618
I was coming to actually tell you

1507
01:07:03,620 --> 01:07:06,254
that I'm leaving to go meet
with the wedding photographer.

1508
01:07:06,256 --> 01:07:07,756
I'll be back in a little bit, though.

1509
01:07:07,758 --> 01:07:09,557
That's good, 'cause your mom asked me

1510
01:07:09,559 --> 01:07:11,059
to clean some stuff out in the garage, so...

1511
01:07:11,061 --> 01:07:13,495
- She did?
That's nice of you.

1512
01:07:13,497 --> 01:07:15,764
Thank you.
- Oh, not a problem.

1513
01:07:15,766 --> 01:07:18,233
All right, I'll see you later.
Yeah.

1514
01:07:18,235 --> 01:07:20,201
- Awesome.
- Yeah.

1515
01:07:22,738 --> 01:07:24,606
Oh, my God.

1516
01:07:36,318 --> 01:07:38,553
Hey, douche bag,

1517
01:07:38,555 --> 01:07:40,789
you and me gotta talk, bro.

1518
01:07:40,791 --> 01:07:43,391
What is your problem now?

1519
01:07:43,393 --> 01:07:45,560
What'd you tell her, man?

1520
01:07:45,562 --> 01:07:46,795
I see the ankle healed up nice.

1521
01:07:46,797 --> 01:07:48,363
Screw my ankle, all right?

1522
01:07:48,365 --> 01:07:49,631
What did you tell her?

1523
01:07:49,633 --> 01:07:52,100
I didn't tell her anything, okay?

1524
01:07:52,102 --> 01:07:53,468
'Cause it would devastate her.

1525
01:07:53,470 --> 01:07:55,670
- Give me a break.
You expect me to believe that?

1526
01:07:55,672 --> 01:07:58,139
After what I saw last night?

1527
01:07:58,141 --> 01:08:00,108
- Last night?
There was nothing to see.

1528
01:08:00,110 --> 01:08:02,577
- I saw you!
I was right over there!

1529
01:08:02,579 --> 01:08:04,245
She kissed you!

1530
01:08:04,247 --> 01:08:05,680
And you kissed her back.

1531
01:08:05,682 --> 01:08:07,649
You love her, man!

1532
01:08:07,651 --> 01:08:10,318
You've always loved her.

1533
01:08:11,721 --> 01:08:13,755
Elizabeth made her choice, okay?

1534
01:08:13,757 --> 01:08:16,524
And whether I like it or not,

1535
01:08:16,526 --> 01:08:19,360
I'm not gonna do anything to screw up her life.

1536
01:08:19,362 --> 01:08:20,795
Well, guess what, jerk off?

1537
01:08:20,797 --> 01:08:22,864
That's exactly what you're doing.

1538
01:08:22,866 --> 01:08:25,166
Now, I'm gonna be back in an hour.

1539
01:08:25,168 --> 01:08:27,435
Make up any bogus excuse you want,

1540
01:08:27,437 --> 01:08:29,838
but when I get back, your bags better be packed

1541
01:08:29,840 --> 01:08:32,841
and you better be headed back to Boston.

1542
01:08:32,843 --> 01:08:35,143
Got it?

1543
01:08:42,486 --> 01:08:44,285
- Whoa!

1544
01:08:44,287 --> 01:08:46,621
Buddy!

1545
01:08:46,623 --> 01:08:47,822
It's okay, buddy.

1546
01:08:47,824 --> 01:08:49,491
- Oh...
- Help me get him in the car.

1547
01:08:49,493 --> 01:08:53,161
- Uh... No. No.
- Where you going?

1548
01:08:53,163 --> 01:08:56,531
Jake, help me get buddy in the car!

1549
01:08:59,236 --> 01:09:01,236
- What--

1550
01:09:03,206 --> 01:09:05,807
- Okay, buddy.
It's okay, I'm here.

1551
01:09:08,344 --> 01:09:10,378
One, two, three.

1552
01:09:10,380 --> 01:09:11,813
Okay, bud.

1553
01:09:11,815 --> 01:09:14,249
Okay, I got you.
I got you.

1554
01:09:14,251 --> 01:09:16,451
Donna.

1555
01:09:16,453 --> 01:09:18,920
Donna, get the car!

1556
01:09:23,559 --> 01:09:24,592
Dr. Dana Burke,

1557
01:09:24,594 --> 01:09:25,793
please dial extension 202.

1558
01:09:25,795 --> 01:09:28,696
Dr. Burke, please dial
extension 202.

1559
01:09:30,833 --> 01:09:32,433
Oh, honey, honey, honey.

1560
01:09:32,435 --> 01:09:33,935
Honey.

1561
01:09:33,937 --> 01:09:37,238
I'm so glad you're here.
- Is buddy okay?

1562
01:09:37,240 --> 01:09:40,275
Mitch is back there with the doctor right now.

1563
01:09:40,277 --> 01:09:42,343
I've called Jake a hundred times.

1564
01:09:42,345 --> 01:09:44,379
He's not answering his phone.

1565
01:09:44,381 --> 01:09:45,513
Mitch!

1566
01:09:45,515 --> 01:09:46,714
Listen, it's gonna be okay.

1567
01:09:46,716 --> 01:09:48,416
Oh, my God, your shirt.

1568
01:09:48,418 --> 01:09:49,651
It's okay, all right?

1569
01:09:49,653 --> 01:09:50,785
The doctors are with him right now.

1570
01:09:50,787 --> 01:09:52,587
He's gonna be out in a second

1571
01:09:52,589 --> 01:09:53,955
to let us know what's going on.

1572
01:09:53,957 --> 01:09:56,391
- How is he?
- Well, we were able

1573
01:09:56,393 --> 01:09:58,660
to stop the bleeding and repair the damage

1574
01:09:58,662 --> 01:10:01,429
to the leg and the abdomen.

1575
01:10:01,431 --> 01:10:02,730
Is he gonna be okay?

1576
01:10:02,732 --> 01:10:04,599
It looks very good.

1577
01:10:04,601 --> 01:10:05,934
He'll have a full recovery.

1578
01:10:05,936 --> 01:10:08,636
- Thank you.
- Thank Mitch.

1579
01:10:08,638 --> 01:10:12,273
It was Mitch's quick action that saved buddy's life.

1580
01:10:12,275 --> 01:10:14,242
Thank you.

1581
01:10:14,244 --> 01:10:16,444
- Can we see him?
- Sure. Just remember,

1582
01:10:16,446 --> 01:10:17,679
he's a little out of it.

1583
01:10:17,681 --> 01:10:19,581
He hasn't been moved to recovery yet,

1584
01:10:19,583 --> 01:10:22,550
but I'm sure he'd like to see his mom and dad.

1585
01:10:22,552 --> 01:10:23,985
Oh, Mitch isn't his dad.

1586
01:10:23,987 --> 01:10:26,688
He's a friend visiting in town.

1587
01:10:26,690 --> 01:10:28,590
- Excuse me.
Sorry to interrupt you,

1588
01:10:28,592 --> 01:10:30,892
but I have some paperwork that needs filling out.

1589
01:10:30,894 --> 01:10:33,261
- No problem.
You two go.

1590
01:10:33,263 --> 01:10:35,964
- Thank you, mom.
- I'll take care of this.

1591
01:10:35,966 --> 01:10:38,466
I'm just gonna give you guys a couple minutes,

1592
01:10:38,468 --> 01:10:41,769
then we have to move him.

1593
01:10:42,805 --> 01:10:44,872
You okay?

1594
01:10:44,874 --> 01:10:46,674
You wanna be alone?

1595
01:10:46,676 --> 01:10:48,776
No.

1596
01:11:01,490 --> 01:11:03,791
Hey...

1597
01:11:26,548 --> 01:11:28,816
I'm just glad he's gonna be all right.

1598
01:11:28,818 --> 01:11:31,419
- Me too.
- Yeah.

1599
01:11:33,289 --> 01:11:34,989
Oh, honey.

1600
01:11:37,026 --> 01:11:39,494
Oh--
thank you, Mitch.

1601
01:11:39,496 --> 01:11:41,296
Thank you so much.

1602
01:11:41,298 --> 01:11:43,931
Okay. I'll see you both
at home.

1603
01:11:43,933 --> 01:11:46,467
- Drive safe, mom.
- Okay.

1604
01:11:49,705 --> 01:11:51,706
I'm just happy he's coming home in a few days.

1605
01:11:51,708 --> 01:11:53,508
- That's great.

1606
01:11:53,510 --> 01:11:56,311
It's Jake. I don't want
to deal with that right now.

1607
01:11:56,313 --> 01:11:59,414
You wanna go get something to eat?

1608
01:12:00,649 --> 01:12:02,917
You know, I know my timing kinda sucks right now,

1609
01:12:02,919 --> 01:12:05,720
but, um... I think
I'm gonna go.

1610
01:12:05,722 --> 01:12:07,722
- Oh, okay.
Um...

1611
01:12:07,724 --> 01:12:09,757
See you at the house.

1612
01:12:09,759 --> 01:12:12,393
No. I mean I'm gonna leave.

1613
01:12:12,395 --> 01:12:13,761
Like for good?

1614
01:12:13,763 --> 01:12:16,597
Mitch, we still have the wedding.

1615
01:12:16,599 --> 01:12:17,899
I need you there.

1616
01:12:17,901 --> 01:12:20,501
- You don't need me there.
- Yes, I do.

1617
01:12:20,503 --> 01:12:23,938
- Why?
Why do you need me there?

1618
01:12:23,940 --> 01:12:26,341
It's your wedding, for Christ's sake.

1619
01:12:26,343 --> 01:12:30,345
You never really talked to me like that before.

1620
01:12:30,347 --> 01:12:32,413
And you know what, Mitch?

1621
01:12:32,415 --> 01:12:35,049
You're right.
Your timing could not be worse.

1622
01:12:35,051 --> 01:12:37,952
Why is it so important that I be at your wedding, huh?

1623
01:12:37,954 --> 01:12:39,554
You wanna rub it in my face?

1624
01:12:39,556 --> 01:12:42,423
- Rub it in your face?
What are you talking about?

1625
01:12:42,425 --> 01:12:43,725
- God, jeez--

1626
01:12:43,727 --> 01:12:45,460
Jake is right.
I am a wuss.

1627
01:12:45,462 --> 01:12:47,128
You might as well just make me the maid of honor.

1628
01:12:47,130 --> 01:12:48,663
What does that mean?

1629
01:12:48,665 --> 01:12:50,665
- You don't get it, do you?
- Get what?

1630
01:12:50,667 --> 01:12:53,401
I'm in love with you.

1631
01:12:55,771 --> 01:12:57,839
Why would you tell me that?

1632
01:12:57,841 --> 01:13:01,976
I've wanted to tell you that
since the first time I met you.

1633
01:13:01,978 --> 01:13:07,515
Do you know why I came to find you?

1634
01:13:07,517 --> 01:13:09,884
Do you remember what we said to each other?

1635
01:13:09,886 --> 01:13:11,519
The day before graduation.

1636
01:13:13,589 --> 01:13:15,423
Ten years ago.

1637
01:13:16,692 --> 01:13:18,960
Tell me.

1638
01:13:18,962 --> 01:13:21,562
Mitch, tell me.

1639
01:13:28,971 --> 01:13:32,106
Take care of yourself.

1640
01:13:47,723 --> 01:13:49,590
Hey.

1641
01:13:49,592 --> 01:13:52,193
Donna filled me in.
Are you okay?

1642
01:13:54,530 --> 01:13:57,064

1705
01:17:37,887 --> 01:17:40,154
Proud today.

1706
01:17:40,156 --> 01:17:42,957
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1707
01:17:42,959 --> 01:17:44,992
Elizabeth...

1708
01:17:44,994 --> 01:17:47,061
You need to stop.

1709
01:17:47,063 --> 01:17:50,731
Mitch isn't coming.

1710
01:17:50,733 --> 01:17:54,001
I know. I just can't
stop thinking about him.

1711
01:17:54,003 --> 01:17:57,738
It's my wedding day, and all I think about is Mitch.

1712
01:17:57,740 --> 01:18:00,875
It may sound strange, but I keep thinking about him too.

1713
01:18:00,877 --> 01:18:02,977
- Mother!
- What?

1714
01:18:02,979 --> 01:18:04,812
He's a nice republican.

1715
01:18:04,814 --> 01:18:06,747
He's actually a registered independent.

1716
01:18:06,749 --> 01:18:09,984
- On the outside.
Not in here.

1717
01:18:11,353 --> 01:18:13,187
I miss him.

1718
01:18:17,959 --> 01:18:19,226
Is she here?

1719
01:18:19,228 --> 01:18:20,795
You're not supposed to be here.

1720
01:18:20,797 --> 01:18:22,096
Donna, I'm gonna be married to this woman

1721
01:18:22,098 --> 01:18:23,431
in about 30 minutes.

1722
01:18:23,433 --> 01:18:24,999
I think it's okay if I see her now, okay?

1723
01:18:25,001 --> 01:18:28,069
No, no. Not until
she walks down that aisle.

1724
01:18:28,071 --> 01:18:29,804
Fine. Fine.

1725
01:18:29,806 --> 01:18:31,305
You haven't seen Mitch around, have you?

1726
01:18:31,307 --> 01:18:33,140
- No. He isn't here.
- Good.

1727
01:18:33,142 --> 01:18:35,142
'Cause the next time I see him, I'm gonna put him

1728
01:18:35,144 --> 01:18:37,278
in the hospital-- you got it?
- Will you stop with that?

1729
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:43,317
He's the one who saved buddy
after you hit him and took off.

1730
01:18:43,319 --> 01:18:45,986
Besides... They made
a pact ten years ago

1731
01:18:45,988 --> 01:18:48,756
to marry each other only for him to find out

1732
01:18:48,758 --> 01:18:50,391
that she's marrying you instead.

1733
01:18:50,393 --> 01:18:52,460
So I think I'd cut him a little slack, honey.

1734
01:18:52,462 --> 01:18:54,061
They made a pact?

1735
01:18:54,063 --> 01:18:56,464
Gosh, Donna, I don't know what to say.

1736
01:18:56,466 --> 01:18:59,300
That's so touching.
Come on, are you kidding me?

1737
01:18:59,302 --> 01:19:00,835
Who the hell even does that?

1738
01:19:00,837 --> 01:19:02,336
And that whole buddy thing, by the way?

1739
01:19:02,338 --> 01:19:04,438
I was trying to protect my family's reputation.

1740
01:19:04,440 --> 01:19:07,041
Go back to your friends, Jake.

1741
01:19:07,043 --> 01:19:08,242
We'll see you downstairs.

1742
01:19:08,244 --> 01:19:10,978
Yeah, I'll see you downstairs.

1743
01:19:15,851 --> 01:19:18,519
- Everything okay?
- Everything's fine.

1744
01:19:18,521 --> 01:19:22,423
It's terrific. So...

1745
01:19:22,425 --> 01:19:25,292
You ready to get married?

1746
01:19:32,200 --> 01:19:34,001
How's dad?

1747
01:19:34,003 --> 01:19:38,506
Well, look, I'm gonna see you guys Sunday anyway, okay?

1748
01:19:38,508 --> 01:19:41,342
Yes, I'm still coming for dinner.

1749
01:19:41,344 --> 01:19:43,077
Okay?

1750
01:19:43,079 --> 01:19:46,380
I love you too.

1751
01:19:46,382 --> 01:19:47,948
All right, bye.

1752
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:06,200
Buddy?

1753
01:20:06,202 --> 01:20:08,202
Buddy!
Ha ha ha!

1754
01:20:08,204 --> 01:20:10,571
Is that you?
You look great?

1755
01:20:10,573 --> 01:20:15,409
I was about to say the same thing about you.

1756
01:20:15,411 --> 01:20:19,146
Looks like someone took up jogging.

1757
01:20:19,148 --> 01:20:20,948
What are you doing here?

1758
01:20:20,950 --> 01:20:22,550
I just thought that you'd like to see

1759
01:20:22,552 --> 01:20:24,985
that buddy was doing okay.

1760
01:20:24,987 --> 01:20:29,890
- So you came all the way to
Boston to tell me buddy's okay.

1761
01:20:29,892 --> 01:20:33,527
No, actually, I came all the way to Boston

1762
01:20:33,529 --> 01:20:36,297
to show you that buddy was okay.

1763
01:20:36,299 --> 01:20:39,033
Why would you do that?

1764
01:20:40,869 --> 01:20:41,936
Well...

1765
01:20:50,079 --> 01:20:52,146
Will you stop with that?

1766
01:20:52,148 --> 01:20:54,448
He's the one who saved buddy

1767
01:20:54,450 --> 01:20:57,351
after you hit him and took off.

1768
01:20:57,353 --> 01:21:00,588
Besides... They made
a pact ten years ago

1769
01:21:00,590 --> 01:21:03,290
to marry each other, only for him to find out

1770
01:21:03,292 --> 01:21:06,460
that she's marrying you instead.

1771
01:21:37,158 --> 01:21:40,094
- Everything okay?
- Everything's fine.

1772
01:21:40,096 --> 01:21:43,330
It's terrific. So...

1773
01:21:43,332 --> 01:21:46,033
You ready to get married?

1774
01:22:10,258 --> 01:22:13,193
Sorry.

1775
01:22:28,009 --> 01:22:30,611
- Whoa, compadre.
Where do you think you're going?

1776
01:22:30,613 --> 01:22:32,413
- Who the hell are you?
Get your hands off me!

1777
01:22:32,415 --> 01:22:34,014
Ow! Ow!

1778
01:22:34,016 --> 01:22:35,349
Now, we can do this the easy way,

1779
01:22:35,351 --> 01:22:36,650
or we can do this my way.

1780
01:22:36,652 --> 01:22:38,619
It's your choice.
- Mother-- ow! Ow!

1781
01:22:38,621 --> 01:22:41,155
Okay. It's my way.
Let's go.

1782
01:22:46,628 --> 01:22:48,095
Ladies and gentlemen,

1783
01:22:48,097 --> 01:22:50,164
may I have your attention, please?

1784
01:22:50,166 --> 01:22:51,498
I'm sorry to inform you,

1785
01:22:51,500 --> 01:22:53,734
but there will no longer be a wedding here today.

1786
01:22:53,736 --> 01:22:55,302
It seems that the bride to be

1787
01:22:55,304 --> 01:22:56,704
has had a change of heart.

1788
01:22:56,706 --> 01:22:58,973
And as I look around this beautiful setting,

1789
01:22:58,975 --> 01:23:01,642
it seems none of you are shocked.

1790
01:23:03,011 --> 01:23:06,080
Excuse me, but you're hurting my son.

1791
01:23:06,082 --> 01:23:08,615
- Yes, I am.
- Would you please stop?

1792
01:23:08,617 --> 01:23:10,517
Where's Donna?

1793
01:23:12,722 --> 01:23:15,122
No worries.
Elizabeth called me.

1794
01:23:15,124 --> 01:23:16,256
Jake, it's over.

1795
01:23:16,258 --> 01:23:19,126
Don't come looking for Elizabeth-- ever.

1796
01:23:19,128 --> 01:23:21,195
If you do, you're not
gonna find her--

1797
01:23:21,197 --> 01:23:22,296
you're gonna find me.

1798
01:23:22,298 --> 01:23:24,031
And I'm from Texas.

1799
01:23:26,168 --> 01:23:28,202
That means I'll barbecue his ass!

1800
01:23:28,204 --> 01:23:30,604
Oh!

1801
01:23:30,606 --> 01:23:32,506
- Y--
- No.

1802
01:23:32,508 --> 01:23:34,608
Learn to leave on a high note.

1803
01:23:34,610 --> 01:23:36,744
You gonna be okay?

1804
01:23:36,746 --> 01:23:39,013
- I'll be fine.
Take care of her.

1805
01:23:39,015 --> 01:23:41,315
- Will do.
- Thank you.

1806
01:23:41,317 --> 01:23:43,317
Good night, everybody.

1807
01:23:48,490 --> 01:23:50,791
You know what, guys?

1808
01:23:50,793 --> 01:23:53,127
I'm gonna go catch the laker game.

1809
01:23:57,132 --> 01:23:59,433
You don't have to worry about him anymore.

1810
01:23:59,435 --> 01:24:01,268
Ha ha ha!
So where we heading?

1811
01:24:01,270 --> 01:24:05,139
- Boston.
- Ha ha! Beantown. Sweet!

1812
01:24:05,141 --> 01:24:07,775
Hey, baby, we just picked her up.

1813
01:24:07,777 --> 01:24:10,544
We're on our way.
- Hold on, girls.

1814
01:24:10,546 --> 01:24:12,646
- Whoo-hoo!

1815
01:24:12,648 --> 01:24:15,282
- Whoo!
- Yee-haw!

1816
01:24:15,284 --> 01:24:19,153
And we didn't stop until we got here.

1817
01:24:22,223 --> 01:24:23,424
Why would you do that?

1818
01:24:23,426 --> 01:24:25,225
I needed to see you.

1819
01:24:25,227 --> 01:24:28,729
I wanted to make things right between us.

1820
01:24:30,598 --> 01:24:33,500
Well...

1821
01:24:33,502 --> 01:24:35,469
You saw me.

1822
01:24:35,471 --> 01:24:38,205
You--

1823
01:24:38,207 --> 01:24:40,741
buddy looks great.

1824
01:24:40,743 --> 01:24:43,110
Mitch, wait.

1825
01:24:47,115 --> 01:24:49,283
It was the day of graduation,

1826
01:24:49,285 --> 01:24:53,720
and you were talking to Dave
and I went over to steal you.

1827
01:24:53,722 --> 01:24:57,558
I told you what a special friend you were to me...

1828
01:24:57,560 --> 01:24:59,593
And if I have a regret it's that

1829
01:24:59,595 --> 01:25:02,529
I never gave you a chance.

1830
01:25:02,531 --> 01:25:07,101
I never gave us a chance.

1831
01:25:07,103 --> 01:25:11,238
So here I am asking for a chance.

1832
01:25:11,240 --> 01:25:13,841
Mitch Becker, will you do me the honor

1833
01:25:13,843 --> 01:25:18,712
of fulfilling a promise that I made to you?

1834
01:25:18,714 --> 01:25:20,881
Will you marry me?

1835
01:25:20,883 --> 01:25:23,684
I love you, and I wanna
spend the rest--

1836
01:25:23,686 --> 01:25:25,853
- wait, stop.

1837
01:25:25,855 --> 01:25:27,554
I must have gone over this moment

1838
01:25:27,556 --> 01:25:29,756
a thousand times in my head and...

1839
01:25:29,758 --> 01:25:31,325
Never once did I ever imagine

1840
01:25:31,327 --> 01:25:34,528
it was going to be you proposing to me.

1841
01:25:34,530 --> 01:25:36,663
You're the love of my life.

1842
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:42,369
Course I'm gonna marry you.

1843
01:25:46,875 --> 01:25:49,343
Wait, wait.
One condition.

1844
01:25:49,345 --> 01:25:52,246
We don't-- we don't wait.
We do this.

1845
01:25:52,248 --> 01:25:55,616
No engagement.
No ceremony.

1846
01:25:55,618 --> 01:25:57,184
No photographers.

1847
01:25:57,186 --> 01:25:59,586
We just...
We do this right now.

1848
01:25:59,588 --> 01:26:02,456
We go down to city hall
and do it-- what do you say?

1849
01:26:02,458 --> 01:26:03,524
Deal?

1850
01:26:03,526 --> 01:26:04,925
I think I can do one better.

1851
01:26:04,927 --> 01:26:08,362
♪ It's such a long way back to you ♪

1852
01:26:08,364 --> 01:26:09,530
Hey, it's me.

1853
01:26:09,532 --> 01:26:12,533
Hold on, I'm gonna put you on speaker.

1854
01:26:12,535 --> 01:26:14,668
Okay, you're on.

1855
01:26:14,670 --> 01:26:16,637
What's up, my brother?

1856
01:26:16,639 --> 01:26:19,740
- Rudy!
- Hey, Mitch, what's happening?

1857
01:26:19,742 --> 01:26:21,842
- Oh, my gosh, Laura, how are--

1858
01:26:21,844 --> 01:26:24,244
is Dave with you?
- He sure is.

1859
01:26:24,246 --> 01:26:27,347
- <i>And I'm with her.</i>
<i>Ha ha ha!</i>

1860
01:26:27,349 --> 01:26:28,682
So, man, any news.

1861
01:26:28,684 --> 01:26:31,818
Well, I think we need pastor Rudy.

1862
01:26:31,820 --> 01:26:33,820
We're getting married.
- Oh, congratulations.

1863
01:26:33,822 --> 01:26:35,322
- There you go, my man.
All right!

1864
01:26:35,324 --> 01:26:37,424
- Wait, wait.
Rudy's a pastor?

1865
01:26:37,426 --> 01:26:38,625
Hell, yeah.

1866
01:26:38,627 --> 01:26:40,194
Online, baby.

1867
01:26:40,196 --> 01:26:41,628
You can get a license or anything.

1868
01:26:41,630 --> 01:26:43,931
- How soon can you be here?
We wanna do it today.

1869
01:26:43,933 --> 01:26:45,966
Uh, half an hour?

1870
01:26:45,968 --> 01:26:48,368
Okay, we'll see you soon.

1871
01:26:50,905 --> 01:26:54,708
You know, they did say that we had 30 minutes.

1872
01:26:54,710 --> 01:26:57,945
Yes, they did.

1873
01:26:59,581 --> 01:27:02,549
Well, to quote my friend Dave,

1874
01:27:02,551 --> 01:27:04,318
I did not predict that.

1875
01:27:04,320 --> 01:27:06,486
And if there's one thing
I've learned, it's--

1876
01:27:06,488 --> 01:27:07,654
- oh, wait, wait, wait.
