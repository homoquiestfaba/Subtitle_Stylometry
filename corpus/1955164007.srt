00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:04,427
BEFORE YOU KNOW IT SHE'S
GOT HER HANDS IN HIS HEAD,

174
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:07,388
AND SHE'S RUBBING
AND PATFING IT, LAUGHING.

175
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,100
SHE WAS SO FULL OF MISCHIEF
AND LOVE AND FUN.

176
00:14:18,316 --> 00:14:19,984
SHE WAS MY LIGHT, JOE.

177
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:24,572
- YOU DO KNOW IT'S OKAY
TO BE SAD, RIGHT?

178
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:29,202
YOU CAN'T HIDE OUT
HERE FOREVER, RAY.

179
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:33,289
YOU JUST CAN'T.

180
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:40,671
THURSDAY...

181
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:43,549
YOU MEET ME IN TOWN.

182
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:48,137
COME ON, WE'LL HAVE

183
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:49,472

00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,975
I'M SUCH A JERK.

185
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:54,936
HOW ARE YOU DOING?

186
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:56,979
- EVERY DAY ABOVE GROUND, BUDDY.

187
00:14:58,189 --> 00:14:59,774
THAT'S A GOOD DAY.

188
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:02,193
- DO YOU WANT COMPANY
AT THE CLINIC?

189
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:04,070
- NO, NO.

190
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:05,863
- WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?

191
00:15:07,115 --> 00:15:08,741
- OH, YOU KNOW WHAT
YOU CAN DO FOR ME.

192
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:12,745
YOU CAN TAKE GOOD CARE
OF MY BABY THERE...

193
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:16,833
AND YOU CAN COOL IT...

194
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:18,751

00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:48,072

00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:54,787
-I'M KATE.

198
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:58,124
THIS ls JACK, MAYA.
-HI.

199
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:01,377
I'M SORRY ABOUT THE FIRE.

200
00:16:02,837 --> 00:16:05,548
YOU CAN'T HAVE A FIRE,
BUT YOU CAN HAVE WATER.

201
00:16:11,012 --> 00:16:13,890
THESE-- THESE ROCKS
ARE SCARRED NOW,

202
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:17,435
BUT IF YOU PUT 'EM IN THE STREAM BED, THE
WATER MIGHT CLEAN THEM UP EVENTUALLY.

203
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:20,313
- OKAY.

204
00:16:20,605 --> 00:16:21,814
THANK YOU.

205
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:24,442
COME ON, MAYA.

206
00:16:28,446 --> 00:16:29,363
Raven: JACK...

207
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:31,908
WE'RE GONNA MAKE
A WATER TRAR

208
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,160
- Maya: REALLY? WE'RE GONNA
CARRY ALL THESE ROCKS?

209
00:16:38,289 --> 00:16:40,166
Raven: THIS IS VERY COOL.

210
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:43,920
SO IF YOU'RE EVER STUCK IN THE DESERT, EVEN
OUT HERE, AND YOU RUN OUT OF WATER...

211
00:16:44,212 --> 00:16:46,589
SO YOU DIG A HOLE
ABOUT EIGHT INCHES DEEP,

212
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:48,216
EIGHT TO TEN.

213
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:49,717
UNDER THAT BUNCH.

214
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,928
AND THEN YOU
LINE THE HOLE

215
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,888
WITH BLACK PLASTIC.

216
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:56,807
SO HERE WE GO.

217
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,186
ALL RIGHT?
POSSIBLY SAVE YOUR LIFE.

218
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:03,898
THIS WILL COLLECT
THE HEAT DURING THE DAY,

219
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:05,775
AND THEN AT NIGHT,
THE GROUND COOLS.

220
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:08,194
THE TEMPERATURE
CONVERSION IN THE MORNING

221
00:17:08,486 --> 00:17:11,614
WILL COLLECT THE CONDENSATION
AND YOU'LL HAVE WATER.

222
00:17:11,906 --> 00:17:13,366
NOT A LOT OF WATER,
BUT A LITTLE.

223
00:17:13,658 --> 00:17:15,284
ENOUGH TO MAYBE
MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

224
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:18,663
WATER TRAP.

225
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:26,671

00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:34,887
BETWEEN YOUR THUMBS.

229
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:36,973
YEAH, AND THEN THAT

GRANDPA CHET SAID THEY--

THEN WHERE DID SHE GO?

287
00:24:13,744 --> 00:24:15,537

300
00:25:07,798 --> 00:25:11,969
I WANT YOU TO KNOW, I WOULD NEVER PUT
THIS PLACE IN DANGER INTENTIONALLY.

301
00:25:15,014 --> 00:25:18,017
I USED TO BRING MY KIDS HERE WHEN THEY
WERE REALLY YOUNG. IT'S VERY SPECIAL.

302
00:25:19,268 --> 00:25:20,185
- WHERE ARE YOUR KIDS?

303
00:25:21,395 --> 00:25:22,730

00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:25,524
- WHAT?

306
00:25:25,816 --> 00:25:27,943
I HAVEN'T BEEN
OUT HERE VERY LONG.

307
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:31,572
- BESIDES, THEY WERE BEING
PARTICULARLY SHITTY.

308
00:25:31,864 --> 00:25:34,408
I KNOW IT'S THEIR JOB AS
TEENAGERS AND ALL, BUT...

309
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:37,953

310
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:41,040
- YEAH, I'M LUCKY
AND THAT'S EXHAUSTING.

311
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:42,374

00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:51,633
SORRY, I DIDN'T MEAN TO--

313
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:53,677
- NO, I...

314
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:55,804
I TAUGHT FOR A REALLY LONG TIME.

315
00:25:58,265 --> 00:26:00,434
THOUGHT IT WAS LIKE
MY WAY OF HAVING KIDS.

316
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:03,771

317
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:08,233

318
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:09,943

00:26:17,201 --> 00:26:18,410

DO YOU KNOW HOW TO
SPOT POISON OAK?

370
00:29:46,994 --> 00:29:49,496
THREE-LEAF CLUSTER,
RED STEM, VERY DISTINCTIVE...

00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:51,206
NASTY RASH.

HAD IT AFTER SPRING BREAK.

373
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:55,961
DISGUSTING.
DROVE HIM CRAZY.

374
00:29:56,253 --> 00:29:59,381
- THERE WAS A STUDY IN JAPAN
WHERE 'I3 PEOPLE WERE ALLERGIC.

375
00:29:59,673 --> 00:30:03,677
HAD A HARMLESS LEAF RUBBED ON ONE
ARM, BUT WERE TOLD IT WAS POISON OAK.

376
00:30:03,969 --> 00:30:06,638
EVERY SINGLE ONE OF 'EM
BROKE OUT IN A HASH.

377
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:07,973
CRAZY, HUH?

378
00:30:08,265 --> 00:30:10,225

381
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:15,981
- YOU FIND ALL THE WOOD OUT HERE?

382
00:30:17,566 --> 00:30:18,817
- AH, THAT'S TOO SOFT
FOR CARVING.

383
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:21,903

SEEING ALL THE STARS.

388
00:30:30,037 --> 00:30:31,413
MOM REALLY LIKES IT,
ALTHOUGH IT MAKES HER SAD.

389
00:30:31,705 --> 00:30:32,664
- WHY?

390
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:35,417
- WE USED TO CAMP A LOT
WITH OUR OTHER MOM.

391
00:30:38,337 --> 00:30:41,173
- THESE HELP ME FEEL CONNECTED
TO SOMETHING I CAN'T EXPLAIN.

392
00:30:43,008 --> 00:30:44,885
I TRY TO GET AT IT
BY CARVING, I SUPPOSE.

393
00:31:19,336 --> 00:31:21,838
- Maya: WHAT, IS SHE YOUR GIRLFRIEND NOW

394
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:23,173

398
00:31:30,263 --> 00:31:32,391

00:31:43,527 --> 00:31:45,737
- Maya: I AM BEING GENTLE WITH IT.

404
00:32:33,827 --> 00:32:35,412
- SEVEN LETTER WORD...

405
00:32:35,704 --> 00:32:38,415
BEGINNING WITH "O"

406
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:40,625
- Maya: OBLIQUE.

I WAS JUST TESTING YOU.

408
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:46,339

Joe: THIS A REAL METAL COIN?

537
00:41:57,598 --> 00:41:59,100
REAL METAL?
-YEAH.

538
00:42:00,435 --> 00:42:01,602
- J0el GLASS SALT SHAKER.

539
00:42:04,397 --> 00:42:05,690
I'M GONNA MAKE THAT...

540
00:42:05,982 --> 00:42:07,817
GO THROUGH THE COIN,
THROUGH THE TABLE.

541
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:16,909
- Mayai IT'S NOT WORKING.

542
00:42:18,286 --> 00:42:19,704
Kate: UH-OH.

543
00:42:19,996 --> 00:42:21,205
- J0e: THE COIN'S A LITTLE--

544
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:31,883
- MORE JOE, JOE?
-PLEASE.

545
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:35,303
AND HOW ABOUT
A CUPCAKE...

546
00:42:35,595 --> 00:42:36,763
CUPCAKE?

547
00:42:37,055 --> 00:42:38,848
- THANKS FOR HELPING HIM.

548
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:41,517
HE SEEMS BETTER. HE'S SLEEPING
THROUGH THE NIGHT THIS WEEK.

549
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:45,313
- THAT'S REALLY
ENCOURAGING.

550
00:42:45,605 --> 00:42:47,607
- HE WAS CRYING LIKE
A BABY WHEN YOU LEFT, JOE.

551
00:42:47,899 --> 00:42:50,860
BUT IT WAS A RELIEF. WHATEVER
YOU DID, IT WORKED.

552
00:42:51,152 --> 00:42:54,030
- I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING, BETTY.

553
00:42:54,322 --> 00:42:57,033
I JUST PASSED ON THE
INFORMATION GIVEN TO ME.

554
00:43:04,457 --> 00:43:05,833
- MORE COFFEE?

555
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:07,376
- NO, THANK YOU.

556
00:43:11,547 --> 00:43:13,341
- HER BOY JUST GOT BACK
FROM AFGHANISTAN.

557
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:20,681
- Jackl WHAT ARE THOSE?

558
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:24,977
- MAGIC PILLS.
-Kate: JACK.

559
00:43:28,773 --> 00:43:30,066
I'M JUST FIGHTING
A LITTLE BUG.

560
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:36,197
I'M MAKING MY FAMOUS...

561
00:43:36,489 --> 00:43:37,907
BLACKBERRY COBBLER LATER.

562
00:43:38,199 --> 00:43:39,700
- Maya: OOH!
-Kate: YUM!

563
00:43:39,992 --> 00:43:41,119
- J0el DO YOU WANT ME
TO BRING SOME BY?

564
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:42,203
- YES.
-PLEASE.

565
00:43:42,495 --> 00:43:43,913
- OH, WE'D LOVE THAT.

566
00:43:44,205 --> 00:43:45,832
AROUND 7:00?

567
00:43:46,124 --> 00:43:47,250
-IT'S A DATE.

568
00:43:47,542 --> 00:43:48,334
- RAVEN?

569
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:49,585
- NO.

570
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:52,755
-I'LL SEE YOU
LATERS, ALLIGATORS.

571
00:43:57,260 --> 00:43:58,719
- BYE.
-THANK YOU.

572
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:14,277
-EXCUSE ME, MISS?

573
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:20,408
ARE YOU OKAY?

574
00:44:21,784 --> 00:44:22,743
- UH...

575
00:44:23,035 --> 00:44:24,162
- YOU WANT SOME HELP?

576
00:44:24,453 --> 00:44:25,830
- NO, UH...

577
00:44:26,122 --> 00:44:27,665
I DON'T THINK SO.

578
00:44:27,957 --> 00:44:29,208
EXCUSE ME.

579
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:48,186
ARE YOU OKAY?

580
00:44:48,477 --> 00:44:49,478
- YEAH.

581
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:52,064
JUST HAVING A
LITTLE SIT DOWN.

582
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:55,443
I TEND TO GET WORN OUT
PRETTY EASY THESE DAYS.

583
00:45:13,085 --> 00:45:14,253
-lS SHE OKAY?

584
00:45:15,421 --> 00:45:17,298
- I DON'T KNOW, HONEY.
I HOPE SO.

585
00:45:19,425 --> 00:45:21,135
- HURRY.

586
00:45:21,427 --> 00:45:22,220
-I'M GETTING OUT.

587
00:45:40,071 --> 00:45:41,030
FUCK.

588
00:45:53,626 --> 00:45:54,961
Joe: IT IS ONE OF THE...

589
00:45:56,045 --> 00:45:57,546
GLORIOUS GIFTS OF LIFE.

590
00:45:58,798 --> 00:46:00,049
IT JUST HIT ME.

591
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:06,681
ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE OKAY?

592
00:46:08,015 --> 00:46:11,102
- I'M HAVING
A REALLY BAD DAY.

593
00:46:11,394 --> 00:46:13,354
- YEAH, I CAN SEE THAT.

594
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:19,318
-IT'S EMBARRASSING.

595
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:21,988
EMBARRASSMENT IS NOT FATAL.

596
00:46:25,241 --> 00:46:27,243
-I'M TRYING TO WORK
ON FORGIVENESS.

597
00:46:28,703 --> 00:46:29,787
- FORGIVENESS, HUH?

598
00:46:31,038 --> 00:46:32,123
THAT'S A BIG ONE.

599
00:46:34,583 --> 00:46:38,587
I WISH I COULD TAKE BACK EVERY
HURTFUL THING I EVER SAID.

600
00:46:41,716 --> 00:46:43,759
BUT MAYBE THAT'S WHAT
MAKES LIFE A LITTLE SWEETER.

601
00:46:45,303 --> 00:46:46,762
TO HAVE THE SHIT...

602
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:48,097
TO COMPARE TO THE SHINE.

603
00:46:50,099 --> 00:46:51,267
PERSPECTIVE.

604
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:55,062
ANOTHER ONE OF
THOSE GIFTS OF AGE.

605
00:46:59,525 --> 00:47:01,193
- MAYBE IT'S ALL
GONNA WORK OUT.

606
00:47:02,737 --> 00:47:03,946
- AND THAT'S THE SPIRIT.

607
00:47:09,952 --> 00:47:11,746
- STANDING...

608
00:47:12,038 --> 00:47:12,830
NOT SUCH A GIFT.

609
00:47:15,333 --> 00:47:16,792
- THANK YOU.

610
00:47:17,084 --> 00:47:18,419
OH, I'M--

611
00:47:24,592 --> 00:47:26,052
THANK YOU.
-YOU'RE WELCOME.

612
00:47:28,179 --> 00:47:30,306
-LT'S NICE TO KNOW
THAT A STRANGER CARES.

613
00:47:30,598 --> 00:47:31,640
- BOY, THAT'S ME.

614
00:47:33,351 --> 00:47:34,727
STRANGE AND CARING.

615
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:42,693
- ANGELA WAS LIKE A
TORNADO PASSING THROUGH.

616
00:47:42,985 --> 00:47:47,156
WILD, THRILLING AND
TOTALLY DESTRUCTIVE.

617
00:47:47,448 --> 00:47:48,991
BUT THE KIDS LOVED HER.

618
00:47:50,201 --> 00:47:51,410
I WAS...

619
00:47:53,746 --> 00:47:54,955
CONSUMED BY HER.

620
00:48:00,628 --> 00:48:02,546
I DIDN'T...

621
00:48:02,838 --> 00:48:04,965
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS GOING
ON WITH MY OWN CHILDREN.

622
00:48:10,388 --> 00:48:11,639
WE HAD TO GET OUT OF THERE.

623
00:48:11,931 --> 00:48:13,766
I TOOK MY VACATION EARLY...

624
00:48:15,184 --> 00:48:16,310
AND HERE WE ARE.

625
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:19,855
- THAT WAS A VERY...

626
00:48:21,107 --> 00:48:22,233
BRAVE MOVE, KATE.

627
00:48:27,488 --> 00:48:28,572
-I'M A LITTLE RUSTY, BUT--

628
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:34,120
WE USED TO HAVE
A LOT OF FUN HERE.

629
00:48:35,204 --> 00:48:36,956
- DON'T WORRY.

630
00:48:37,248 --> 00:48:38,499
YOU'LL HAVE FUN HERE AGAIN.

631
00:48:39,834 --> 00:48:41,335
- YEAH?
-OH, YEAH.

632
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:47,466
- YEAH.

633
00:48:51,554 --> 00:48:53,639
HEY, JOE, HOW LONG
HAVE YOU KNOWN RAVEN?

634
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:55,558
- HER WHOLE LIFE...

635
00:48:55,850 --> 00:48:57,476
PRETTY MUCH.

636
00:48:57,768 --> 00:48:59,687
HER FOLKS BOUGHT
MY DADDY'S CABIN...

637
00:49:01,397 --> 00:49:03,441
AS A GETAWAY
FROM THE BIG CITY.

638
00:49:03,732 --> 00:49:05,192
- AND SHE DOESN'T LIVE HERE?

639
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:08,487
- NO.

640
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:13,451
BUT SHE HAS BEEN HOLED UP IN THAT
CABIN SINCE EVERYTHING FELL APART.

641
00:49:15,536 --> 00:49:16,704
- WHAT HAPPENED?

642
00:49:18,581 --> 00:49:20,958
- SHE LOST HER NIECE
ABOUT A MONTH AGO.

643
00:49:22,168 --> 00:49:24,420
THEY WERE VERY CLOSE.

644
00:49:26,589 --> 00:49:27,882
-I'M SO SORRY.

645
00:49:30,426 --> 00:49:33,053
- YOU DON'T NEED
TO FEEL SORRY...

646
00:49:35,014 --> 00:49:37,224
AND RAVEN DOESN'T NEED
TO PUNISH HERSELF ANYMORE.

647
00:49:39,477 --> 00:49:40,686
WHAT WE NEED...

648
00:49:43,022 --> 00:49:44,815
IS TO EAT SOME COBBLER.

649
00:49:48,569 --> 00:49:50,529
- I LIKE YOU.

650
00:50:47,253 --> 00:50:49,964
-"THERE IS NO MISTAKING
THE RAUCOUS CAW...

651
00:50:50,256 --> 00:50:53,175
THE DEEP RESONANT CAW
IS ITS TRADEMARK."

652
00:50:53,467 --> 00:50:55,052
SEE, I TOLD YOU.

653
00:50:55,344 --> 00:50:56,303
- NO.

654
00:50:56,595 --> 00:50:57,680
- YOU NEED TO DRINK WATER, MAYA.

655
00:50:57,972 --> 00:50:59,807
-IT BLOATS ME.
-DON'T START THAT AGAIN.

656
00:51:00,099 --> 00:51:01,642
DRINK THE WATER.
YOU NEED IT.

657
00:51:02,977 --> 00:51:04,562
- DON'T TELL ME
THAT WAS A RAVEN.

658
00:51:04,853 --> 00:51:07,731
-IT IS IF IT'S
IMITATING A COYOTE.

659
00:51:08,023 --> 00:51:10,859
-"RAVENS ARE QUARRELSOME,
YET THEY DEMONSTRATE...

660
00:51:11,151 --> 00:51:13,571
CONSIDERABLE DEVOTION
TO THEIR FAMILIES."

661
00:52:05,331 --> 00:52:08,751
--J0e: IF SHE GOT IN HER MIND TO GO
FOR A RUN, SHE COULD BE GONE FOR DAYS.

662
00:52:11,503 --> 00:52:12,921
- HEY, JOE...

663
00:52:13,213 --> 00:52:15,507
WOULD YOU MIND STAYING WITH JACK
AND MAYA FOR A WHILE?

664
00:52:16,759 --> 00:52:18,093
- NOT AT ALL.

665
00:52:18,385 --> 00:52:19,303
- THANKS.

666
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:46,997


667
00:52:48,207 --> 00:52:49,500
- MY LEG IS BETTER.

668
00:52:49,792 --> 00:52:51,001
- OH, THAT'S GOOD.

669
00:52:51,293 --> 00:52:52,211
- WHAT HAPPENED?

670
00:52:52,503 --> 00:52:53,545
- OH!

671
00:52:56,006 --> 00:52:57,675
I WAS RACING DEMONS.

672
00:52:57,966 --> 00:52:58,884
- OH.

673
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:01,345
- I LOST.

674
00:53:06,058 --> 00:53:07,142
- FOLLOW ME.

675
00:53:29,164 --> 00:53:30,290
SIT.

676
00:53:34,086 --> 00:53:35,504
I'M REALLY VERY
GOOD AT THIS.

677
00:53:35,796 --> 00:53:36,672
ASK MY KIDS.

678
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:46,682
LET'S CLEAN UP
SOME OF THESE SCRATCHES.

679
00:53:48,434 --> 00:53:49,852
LET'S SEE.

680
00:53:52,521 --> 00:53:53,480
TAKE THIS OFF.

681
00:54:14,877 --> 00:54:15,794
OKAY.

682
00:54:32,227 --> 00:54:33,270
THERE.

683
00:54:39,318 --> 00:54:41,111
CAN I CLEAN THAT?

684
00:54:53,081 --> 00:54:54,374
IS THAT OKAY?

685
00:55:25,322 --> 00:55:26,907
IT'S NOT SO BAD.

686
00:57:53,178 --> 00:57:55,097
- STAY CLOSE. STAY CLOSE.

687
00:58:00,143 --> 00:58:01,937
YOU'RE OKAY,
COME HERE.

688
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:04,523
YOU'RE OKAY.

689
00:58:05,691 --> 00:58:07,734
NO, NO, NO, NO. NO!

690
00:58:08,026 --> 00:58:10,320
NO!
-SHH, RAY... RAY.

691
00:58:12,364 --> 00:58:13,490
YOU WERE DREAMING.

692
00:58:13,782 --> 00:58:15,492
- I ALMOST REACHED HER THIS TIME.

693
00:58:19,997 --> 00:58:21,206
I ALMOST TOUCHED HER.

694
00:58:26,545 --> 00:58:28,005
I'M NEVER LATE.

695
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:31,049
I'M NEVER LATE.

696
00:58:35,470 --> 00:58:36,513
HE DIDN'T KNOW HER.

697
00:58:38,724 --> 00:58:40,475
IT DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING
TO DO WITH HER.

698
00:58:44,187 --> 00:58:47,024
HE WAS CRAZY AND HE HAD A GUN
AND SHE WAS THERE.

699
00:58:48,608 --> 00:58:50,027
BUT I SHOULD'VE BEEN THERE.

700
00:58:53,655 --> 00:58:54,614
-IT'S OKAY.

701
00:58:54,906 --> 00:58:56,199
- I SHOULD'VE BEEN THERE.

702
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:02,205
-IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.
IT'S OKAY.

703
00:59:02,497 --> 00:59:03,915
- NO.

704
00:59:08,545 --> 00:59:09,629
- WHAT?

705
00:59:12,424 --> 00:59:14,217
- I CAN'T FEEL GOOD.

706
01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:11,918
- HEY.

707
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:13,461
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

708
01:01:13,753 --> 01:01:15,005
Maya: WE HIKED.

709
01:01:15,297 --> 01:01:17,007
- SHE ACTUALLY DID.
IT'S LIKE A MIRACLE.

710
01:01:17,299 --> 01:01:19,593
- NOT REALLY MY THING.
-WHAT ABOUT YOUR MOM?

711
01:01:19,885 --> 01:01:21,386
- OH, SHE KNOWS WE'RE HIKING.

712
01:01:21,678 --> 01:01:22,846
- DOES SHE KNOW YOU'RE HERE?

713
01:01:23,972 --> 01:01:24,890
UMM...

714
01:01:26,141 --> 01:01:27,184
NO.

715
01:01:28,435 --> 01:01:29,394
CAN WE HANG WITH YOU?

716
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:31,605
-I'M WORKING.

717
01:01:31,897 --> 01:01:34,524
- SEE, I TOLD YOU THIS WAS STUPID.
-NO, YOU DIDN'T.

718
01:01:37,611 --> 01:01:38,820
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO.

719
01:01:40,989 --> 01:01:42,282
'SEE?

720
01:01:42,574 --> 01:01:44,075
I TOLD YOU
THIS WAS STUPID.

721
01:01:44,367 --> 01:01:45,577
- HOW'D YOU FIND
YOUR WAY HERE?

722
01:01:45,869 --> 01:01:46,870
- WE FIGURED IT OUT.

723
01:01:47,162 --> 01:01:48,955
- Jack: WE KINDA JUST
FOLLOWED THE TRAILS.

724
01:01:49,247 --> 01:01:50,832
I KINDA SEEN YOU
WALK AROUND.

725
01:01:51,124 --> 01:01:52,459
- Raven: I'M IMPRESSED.
-Maya: CREEPER.

726
01:01:52,751 --> 01:01:54,211
- Jack: THANK YOU.
-Raven: CREEPER?

727
01:01:54,502 --> 01:01:56,338
IS THAT HIS NICKNAME?
-Jack: SHE'S JUST JEALOUS.

728
01:01:56,630 --> 01:01:57,547
Raven: UH-HUH.

729
01:01:58,715 --> 01:02:00,217
- YOU EVER GET
LOST OUT HERE?

730
01:02:00,508 --> 01:02:02,636
- THE MAIN TRAILS
LEAD TO THE ROADS...

731
01:02:02,928 --> 01:02:03,803
EVENTUALLY.

732
01:02:10,894 --> 01:02:13,647
THE NEXT PERSON WHO COMES THROUGH
HERE WON'T HAVE TO LOOK AT THIS SHIT.

733
01:02:15,065 --> 01:02:16,733
DETRITUS.

734
01:02:17,025 --> 01:02:18,818
- I GOT ONE.

735
01:02:19,110 --> 01:02:21,905
- DOESN'T IT JUST PISS THE SHIT OUT OF YOU
THAT PEOPLE TH ROW THEIR DETRITUS OUT HERE?

736
01:02:22,197 --> 01:02:23,657
-IT'S BETTER THAN EFFLUVIA.

737
01:02:23,949 --> 01:02:26,618
-IT'S THE PROXIMITY TO THE
VAPOROUS FORM THAT'S HAZARDOUS.

738
01:02:26,910 --> 01:02:28,495
- TOUCHE.

739
01:02:30,247 --> 01:02:33,541
YOU KNOW WHAT? MY DREAM
IS TO CLEAN ALL OF THIS UP.

740
01:02:33,833 --> 01:02:34,918
BIT BY BIT IS FINE.

741
01:02:35,210 --> 01:02:36,294
Maya: PEOPLE SUCK.

742
01:02:36,586 --> 01:02:37,796
- WELL, YOU CAN'T CONTROL THAT.

743
01:02:38,088 --> 01:02:39,589
- WELL, THEN WHAT'S THE POINT?

744
01:02:39,881 --> 01:02:41,132
EVERYTHING PISSES HER OFF...

745
01:02:41,424 --> 01:02:43,176
ESPECIALLY ME.

746
01:02:43,468 --> 01:02:45,428
- BECAUSE YOU'RE A PUNK
ASSHOLE AND YOU NEVER SHUT UP.

747
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:52,227
- YOU'LL HAVE TIME FOR
EVERYTHING YOU WANT.

748
01:02:56,982 --> 01:02:58,108
YOU SHOULD GET BACK
TO YOUR MOM.

749
01:03:20,672 --> 01:03:22,007
Maya: THAT WAS ACTUALLY FUN.

750
01:03:22,299 --> 01:03:23,800
- JaCk: YEAH, I MEAN,
I KINDA THOUGHT...

751
01:03:24,092 --> 01:03:25,760
IT WOULD BE LIKE,
MORE WEIRD THAN FUN.

752
01:03:26,052 --> 01:03:28,722
- Maya: BUT SHE'S NOT AS CRAZY. --JaCk:
WELL, YEAH, NOW THAT WE LIKE, KNOW HER.

753
01:03:30,432 --> 01:03:32,726
I MEAN, REMEMBER
THE FIRST DAY WE SAW HER?

754
01:03:33,018 --> 01:03:35,687
- THE BIRD AND THE SHIRT.
- YEAH.

755
01:03:35,979 --> 01:03:37,772
YOU THINK WE SHOULD
TELL MOM WE WENT?

756
01:03:38,064 --> 01:03:39,149
- HEY, BEAUTIFUL.

757
01:03:39,441 --> 01:03:41,901
HEY, HANDSOME.
-ANGELA! HI!

758
01:03:42,193 --> 01:03:44,779
'HEY!

759
01:03:45,071 --> 01:03:48,283
- OH, WOW, YOU TWO ARE
SIGHT FOR SORE EYES.

760
01:03:48,575 --> 01:03:51,369
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? -OH, YOUR
MOM DIDN'T TELL YOU I WAS COMING?

761
01:03:51,661 --> 01:03:53,163
- NO, SHE SAID YOU WEREN'T.

762
01:03:53,455 --> 01:03:55,749
- SHE MUST'VE WANTED TO SURPRISE YOU.
-SHE KNOWS?

763
01:03:56,041 --> 01:03:57,667
- LET'S TAKE A WALK.

764
01:03:57,959 --> 01:04:00,378
- OKAY. -I WANT TO
KNOW ALL THE GOSSIP...

765
01:04:00,670 --> 01:04:01,963
TELL ME EVERYTHING.

766
01:04:02,255 --> 01:04:03,673
AND YOU CAN TELL ME...

767
01:04:03,965 --> 01:04:05,717
ALL ABOUT HOTFIE SCOTTY.

768
01:04:14,893 --> 01:04:17,312
- YOU KNOW SHE DOESN'T LIKE SCOT
SO WE'VE BEEN SNEAKING AROUND...

769
01:04:17,604 --> 01:04:19,564
BUT SHE CAUGHT US IN BED,
SO SHE BROUGHT US HERE.

770
01:04:19,856 --> 01:04:21,691
- OH, HONEY, THAT'S BIG.

771
01:04:21,983 --> 01:04:23,526
DID YOU TWO--
-IT WASN'T A BIG DEAL.

772
01:04:23,818 --> 01:04:25,320
-IT'S NOT WHAT YOU TOLD MOM.

773
01:04:25,612 --> 01:04:29,282
- OH, YOU KNOW IT'S HARD TO TALK
TO SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T LISTEN.

774
01:04:29,574 --> 01:04:31,743
OH, SWEETIE,
YOU ARE GROWING UP.

775
01:04:32,952 --> 01:04:34,371
AND WHAT ABOUT YOU, HANDSOME?

776
01:04:34,662 --> 01:04:35,789
DO YOU HAVE A NEW
GIRLFRIEND?

777
01:04:36,081 --> 01:04:36,998
- NOT REALLY.

778
01:04:37,290 --> 01:04:38,750
- HE CAN'T SEEM TO FIND
HIS BRAIN AROUND GIRLS.

779
01:04:39,042 --> 01:04:41,169
- SHUT UP.
-SHE'S JUST MESSING WITH YOU.

780
01:04:41,461 --> 01:04:42,629
I HAVE AN IDEA.

781
01:04:42,921 --> 01:04:45,215
LET'S GO TO TOWN AND PICK
UP SOME PARTY SUPPLIES...

782
01:04:45,507 --> 01:04:47,008
AND WE'LL SURPRISE YOUR MOM.

783
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:49,344

790
01:05:22,335 --> 01:05:24,379
- OF COURSE HE DOES.

791
01:05:24,671 --> 01:05:26,464
- SEE, I WISH SHE UNDERSTOOD
ME THE WAY YOU DO.

792
01:05:26,756 --> 01:05:29,592
- Angela: SHE JUST
DOESN'T GET IT, YOU KNOW?

793
01:05:29,884 --> 01:05:31,386
MAYBE SOMEDAY--

794
01:05:31,678 --> 01:05:33,221

WHO WAS THAT...

798
01:05:39,936 --> 01:05:42,230
WOMAN YOU WERE HAVING
LUNCH WITH IN TOWN?

799
01:05:42,522 --> 01:05:43,815
- WAIT, YOU WERE IN TOWN?

800
01:05:44,107 --> 01:05:45,817
WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY HI?

801
01:05:46,109 --> 01:05:48,820
- OH. I SAW YOU GUYS
FROM A DISTANCE AND--

802
01:05:49,112 --> 01:05:51,614
WELL, YOU WERE HEADING OFF.

803
01:05:51,906 --> 01:05:52,907
SO, WHO IS SHE?

804
01:05:53,199 --> 01:05:55,743
- THE CRAZY WOODS LADY?
-MOM ALMOST RAN HER OVER.

805
01:05:56,035 --> 01:05:58,371
- Angela: MOM IS
A TERRIBLE DRIVER.

806
01:05:58,663 --> 01:06:00,290
- YEAH. NOT AS BAD AS MAYA.

807
01:06:00,582 --> 01:06:02,500
- IT'S BECAUSE MOM REFUSES TO
BELIEVE THAT I CAN ACTUALLY DRIVE.

808
01:06:02,792 --> 01:06:04,210
AND I'M 'I6.
I HAVE A LICENSE.

809
01:06:04,502 --> 01:06:05,837
I'M SO SICK OF HER--

810
01:06:06,129 --> 01:06:08,423
- ARE THEY SPENDING
A LOT OF TIME TOGETHER?

811
01:06:08,715 --> 01:06:10,383
- SHE NEVER EVEN ASKED US
IF WE WANTED TO COME HERE--

812
01:06:10,675 --> 01:06:12,469
- MAYA, I NEED YOU TO FOCUS!

813
01:06:13,845 --> 01:06:15,388
I NEVER WANTED
TO LEAVE, YOU KNOW?

814
01:06:17,140 --> 01:06:18,308
Maya: OKAY.

815
01:06:19,684 --> 01:06:21,269
Angela: I'M SORRY, KID.

816
01:06:23,104 --> 01:06:25,315
YOU KNOW, YOUR MOM
HAS SERIOUS PROBLEMS.

01:06:27,609 --> 01:06:28,985
Maya: WELL, I MEAN...

818
01:06:29,277 --> 01:06:31,571
SHE'S A PAIN, BUTI MEAN, I
DON'T THINK IT'S INTENTIONAL.

819
01:06:32,906 --> 01:06:36,576
- Angela: YOU DON'T THINK
IT'S INTENTIONAL?

820
01:06:36,868 --> 01:06:39,454
IF SHE HADN'T TEXTED ME, I WOULDN'T
HAVE KNOWN WHERE YOU GUYS WERE.

821
01:06:41,873 --> 01:06:45,293
YOU KNOW, IF SHE WEREN'T SO
SELFISH, WE WOULDN'T BE HERE NOW.

822
01:06:45,585 --> 01:06:47,545
--JaCk: WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU GUYS?
-Angela: NOTHING HAPPENED.

823
01:06:53,009 --> 01:06:54,219

WE SHOULD GO BACK.

824
01:06:54,511 --> 01:06:55,261
Angela: SIT STILL!

825
01:07:08,525 --> 01:07:10,568

IF I LEAVE YOU ALONE HERE...

832
01:07:29,754 --> 01:07:31,673
YOU WILL BE SCARED SHITLESS.

833
01:07:33,007 --> 01:07:34,050
- SHOULD WE GO TO HER?

834
01:07:36,344 --> 01:07:37,262
- I DON'T KNOW.

835
01:07:42,642 --> 01:07:44,185
IT'S A TRAIL.

836
01:07:44,477 --> 01:07:45,728
HURRY UP.

837
01:07:46,020 --> 01:07:49,315

I WOULD EVER HURT YOU?

838
01:07:50,608 --> 01:07:52,986
I LOVE YOU BOTH SO MUCH!
