00:00:32,379 --> 00:00:34,847
Dear Mr. Inman,

2
00:00:34,915 --> 00:00:37,782
I began by counting the days,

3
00:00:37,884 --> 00:00:39,852
then the months.

4
00:00:40,687 --> 00:00:45,818
I don't count on anything anymore
except the hope that you will return,

5
00:00:45,892 --> 00:00:51,592
and the silent fear that in the years
since we saw each other,

6
00:00:51,665 --> 00:00:58,229
this war, this awful war, will have
changed us both beyond all reckoning.

7
00:01:51,124 --> 00:01:53,592
This poor boy's from Alabama,

8
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:57,426
- He's a long way from home,
- Thank you,

9
00:02:01,001 --> 00:02:03,993
why don't them Yanks just attack?

10
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,845
Got any shirts, son?

11
00:02:22,522 --> 00:02:24,786
It's Mo Oakley's boy,

12
00:02:25,792 --> 00:02:28,727
Can't be old enough to fight, can he?

13
00:02:34,835 --> 00:02:37,360
- Good morning,
- Morning, son,

14
00:02:38,104 --> 00:02:40,698
Got some boots and jackets,
You want one?

15
00:02:40,774 --> 00:02:43,436
- Here, You want that?
- Thanks,

16
00:02:44,845 --> 00:02:47,336
I hope these boots can hold up
for 400 miles,

17
00:02:47,414 --> 00:02:50,406
'cause they're taking me
back to Cold Mountain,

18
00:02:55,422 --> 00:02:58,391
I think now
on the fleeting moments between us

19
00:02:58,458 --> 00:03:00,858
and wish I could repair them.

20
00:03:02,295 --> 00:03:06,425
My awkward nature,
the things left unsaid.

21
00:03:11,037 --> 00:03:13,528
All right, that's it,

22
00:03:17,878 --> 00:03:20,176
Enough powder here
to blow a hole in the sky,

23
00:03:20,247 --> 00:03:23,614
 Yeah,
a real Yankee good mornin',

24
00:03:38,098 --> 00:03:41,556
That old book of yours is in shreds,

25
00:03:42,736 --> 00:03:45,705
Same as us, Seen too much war,

26
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:53,179
Hey, Oakley, Don't worry, son,
Them Yankee boys keep store hours,

27
00:03:53,246 --> 00:03:55,373
They ain't open yet,

28
00:04:05,025 --> 00:04:07,823
Close it up,

29
00:04:18,972 --> 00:04:22,738
- Hey, where'd you come from?
- Hey, that's fresh breakfast,

30
00:04:22,809 --> 00:04:24,800
- He's mine, Butcher,
- Hey! Hey! Get away!

31
00:04:24,878 --> 00:04:27,847
- Hey, I saw him first,
- Come on!

32
00:04:27,914 --> 00:04:31,475
- I saw it first!
- That's my rabbit! That's my rabbit!

33
00:04:34,387 --> 00:04:38,084
Get your paws off my rabbit!
Get your paws off my rabbit!

36
00:05:22,636 --> 00:05:25,230
when I came with my father
to the town of Cold Mountain,

37
00:05:25,305 --> 00:05:27,899
I was so shy of how I looked,

38
00:05:27,974 --> 00:05:30,534
so out of place.

39
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:34,910
But did you know how happy I was
to escape from Charleston,

40
00:05:34,981 --> 00:05:38,849
from a world of slaves
and corsets and cotton?

41
00:05:38,952 --> 00:05:41,682
what do you fools think
you'll be fightin' for?

42
00:05:41,788 --> 00:05:45,224
- The South?
- I call this nail Northern Aggression,

43
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:48,522
-  Damn right,
- I call this nail the Yankee Skulls,

44
00:05:48,595 --> 00:05:51,325
last time I checked,
the South was a direction,

45
00:05:51,398 --> 00:05:53,923
Never figured you
for a lincoln lover, JT,

46
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,695
 I tell you,
as soon as I finish this chapel,

47
00:05:55,769 --> 00:05:57,896
I'm gonna go off
and kill me some Yankees,

48
00:05:57,971 --> 00:05:59,233
Piss and vinegar,

49
00:05:59,305 --> 00:06:01,796
Fightin' for a rich man's slave,
that's what,

50
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:03,467
 whoa, here comes the minister,

51
00:06:03,543 --> 00:06:06,273
 Ben, thank you,
will you assist my daughter?

52
00:06:06,346 --> 00:06:08,314
lord have mercy,
look at that bonnet,

53
00:06:08,381 --> 00:06:10,212
look what's in it,

54
00:06:10,316 --> 00:06:12,284
 Oakley,
hand me the hammer, boy,

55
00:06:12,352 --> 00:06:14,252
That's a true Southern belle,

56
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:19,257
- Mr, Swanger! Good morning to you,
- Morning, Reverend,

57
00:06:19,325 --> 00:06:22,419
Esco, you remember my daughter, Ada,

58
00:06:22,495 --> 00:06:24,656
- Miss Monroe,
- Good morning,

59
00:06:24,731 --> 00:06:25,891
- Morning,
-  Morning,

60
00:06:25,965 --> 00:06:28,024
- Excellent progress,
- Morning,

61
00:06:28,101 --> 00:06:30,763
- Mrs, Swanger, Mrs, Castlereagh,
- Morning, Reverend,

62
00:06:30,837 --> 00:06:32,930
Now, if y'all will excuse me,

63
00:06:33,006 --> 00:06:37,943
In Charleston, my congregation would still
be disputing the size of the windows,

64
00:06:38,011 --> 00:06:38,773
 It's a chapel,

65
00:06:38,845 --> 00:06:41,871
Miss Monroe,
I was just thinkin' about you,

66
00:06:41,948 --> 00:06:45,748
Cold Mountain must feel
like the end of the world,

67
00:06:45,852 --> 00:06:48,412
Not at all,

68
00:06:48,521 --> 00:06:52,958
- It's very beautiful,
- well, you put us all to shame,

69
00:06:53,026 --> 00:06:56,189
Men up here had a bearing on
what they thought a woman was,

70
00:06:56,262 --> 00:06:59,561
- and then you showed up,
- Oh...

71
00:06:59,632 --> 00:07:01,896
- No, I doubt that,
- Oh, believe me,

72
00:07:01,968 --> 00:07:07,099
If you was to say a word to one of these
fools, I could get my top field cleared,

73
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:10,873
- Any one?
- No, um...

74
00:07:11,811 --> 00:07:14,109
Him in particular,

75
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:16,205
Up in the rafters,

76
00:07:16,282 --> 00:07:19,080
won't normally say boo to a goose,

77
00:07:22,088 --> 00:07:25,888
He's been pressin' me
since the day you arrived here,

78
00:07:29,929 --> 00:07:33,160
- Your top field cleared?
- That's right,

79
00:07:37,804 --> 00:07:41,331
Good morning, I'm Ada Monroe,

80
00:07:42,275 --> 00:07:43,833
Inman,

81
00:07:44,177 --> 00:07:45,371
Inman,

82
00:07:45,445 --> 00:07:47,310
wP Inman,

83
00:07:48,915 --> 00:07:50,382
wP Inman,

84
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:53,180
Repeatin' a thing doesn't improve it,

85
00:07:55,088 --> 00:07:57,682
People call me Inman,

86
00:07:59,926 --> 00:08:01,791
How 'bout that? Inman speaks,

87
00:08:01,861 --> 00:08:05,888
If you were to take a glass of cider,
your friends might stop staring,

88
00:08:08,501 --> 00:08:10,469
Inman,

89
00:08:11,971 --> 00:08:16,999
 You're just jealous, I'm gonna
take her for a walk at Bishop's Creek,

90
00:08:17,076 --> 00:08:19,874
-  Billy, is this frame flush?
- Thank you,

91
00:08:19,946 --> 00:08:23,712
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
Thank you, yeah, right,

92
00:08:24,584 --> 00:08:27,747
 Richie, I seen your house, There
ain't a square angle anywhere near it,

93
00:08:27,854 --> 00:08:30,015
And what do you do?

94
00:08:30,123 --> 00:08:32,387
I work wood,

95
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:34,289
Hunt,

96
00:08:35,328 --> 00:08:37,888
Mostly work wood,

97
00:08:40,099 --> 00:08:42,158
Clear fields?

98
00:08:46,339 --> 00:08:48,773
I can clear a field,

99
00:08:49,876 --> 00:08:53,642
was there something in particular
you wished to say to me?

100
00:08:58,218 --> 00:09:00,846
Not that comes to me,

101
00:09:07,193 --> 00:09:09,923
I'll say thank you... for the cider,

106
00:11:00,139 --> 00:11:02,903
Move back! Go back! Move back!

107
00:11:02,976 --> 00:11:05,672
Go back! Go back!

108
00:11:05,745 --> 00:11:10,580
They're trapped in the wrong
damn crater, whole plan backfired on 'em,

109
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:12,948
 Send them Yanks straight to hell,

110
00:11:13,052 --> 00:11:16,044
-  Hold it, hold it,
-  let's go, Turn it around,

111
00:11:18,524 --> 00:11:21,322
 Damn fools
dug their own grave,

112
00:11:21,394 --> 00:11:24,022
 we've got 'em now, boys,

113
00:11:25,832 --> 00:11:29,495
- It's a turkey shoot,
- what?

114
00:11:29,569 --> 00:11:32,902
It's a turkey shoot,
They've run themselves into a hole,

115
00:11:32,972 --> 00:11:35,133
Hell's busted,

117
00:12:36,569 --> 00:12:38,628
Oakley!

118
00:12:50,683 --> 00:12:53,015
Oakley!

120
00:12:59,959 --> 00:13:01,722
Oakley!

123
00:13:28,087 --> 00:13:31,284
- Inman! Inman!
-  Oakley!

124
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,455
Oakley!

127
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:06,417
- Inman!
- Come on,

128
00:14:07,727 --> 00:14:09,558
Inman,

129
00:14:12,031 --> 00:14:14,465
- I've got you,

130
00:14:42,061 --> 00:14:44,689
I got a few,

131
00:14:44,764 --> 00:14:47,289
- You saw?
- I saw,

132
00:14:51,437 --> 00:14:54,099
Am I gonna die?

133
00:14:56,809 --> 00:14:59,471
Your folks can be real proud of you,

134
00:15:13,059 --> 00:15:17,894
 Son, this fellow says
he'll play whatever you want,

135
00:15:19,999 --> 00:15:23,799
what about Bonaparte's Retreat?
That's one I play,

136
00:15:28,975 --> 00:15:32,411
No, Play me somethin' sweet,

137
00:15:32,478 --> 00:15:35,345
like a girl's waiting for me,

138
00:15:36,315 --> 00:15:40,308
- You heard him,
- I only know a couple of tunes,

139
00:15:40,419 --> 00:15:42,887
like when you're at Bishop's Creek...

140
00:15:43,723 --> 00:15:46,658
and you're thirsty...

141
00:15:46,726 --> 00:15:49,627
and the water's so cool,

142
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:53,525
I don't know what music that is,

144
00:16:18,924 --> 00:16:22,018
I'm reachin' Cold Mountain before you,

145
00:16:59,298 --> 00:17:01,198
 Good morning, Sally,

147
00:17:05,771 --> 00:17:09,229
- well, that's a fine-sounding thing,
- Oh...

148
00:17:10,042 --> 00:17:12,033
My piano,

149
00:17:13,646 --> 00:17:15,773
Oh, I've been missing it,

150
00:17:15,848 --> 00:17:20,581
Thank you, by the way,
Inman's in my top field clearing his debt,

151
00:17:20,686 --> 00:17:22,654
Oh, dear,

153
00:17:26,592 --> 00:17:28,924
And then he had nothing to say,

154
00:17:28,994 --> 00:17:31,485
He was happy,

155
00:17:32,765 --> 00:17:35,199
Really?

156
00:17:35,267 --> 00:17:38,134
Are men so different in Charleston?

157
00:17:40,206 --> 00:17:41,867
Men?

158
00:17:43,275 --> 00:17:45,266
I don't know,

159
00:17:45,344 --> 00:17:51,078
If you're sayin' you might like him,
why not go over and say good mornin'?

160
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:53,141
I should be gettin' along,

161
00:17:53,252 --> 00:17:56,085
 walk on, quickly,

162
00:17:56,155 --> 00:17:59,249
Come on, walk on, Slowly,

163
00:17:59,358 --> 00:18:01,258
walk on,

165
00:18:45,671 --> 00:18:48,367
 My dear daughter, Ada,

166
00:18:48,441 --> 00:18:55,005
who's given up so much for so long to help
me in my ministry, and upon whom I rely,

167
00:18:57,616 --> 00:19:03,851
Friends, we are both very happy
to have this opportunity tonight...

168
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:07,788
to thank you from our hearts...

169
00:19:08,928 --> 00:19:14,127
for your kind welcome
and, most of all, such a fine chapel,

171
00:19:15,634 --> 00:19:17,966
So... 

172
00:19:18,037 --> 00:19:21,029
... thank you, and God bless you,

173
00:19:24,143 --> 00:19:30,275
Our house is always open
to any of you at any time,

174
00:19:30,349 --> 00:19:32,840
welcome,

175
00:19:32,952 --> 00:19:33,976
Esco?

176
00:19:38,324 --> 00:19:40,292
That gentleman - he help build the chapel?

177
00:19:40,392 --> 00:19:43,384
 Him? No, that's Teague,

178
00:19:43,462 --> 00:19:47,364
At one time the Teague family
owned the whole of Cold Mountain,

179
00:19:47,433 --> 00:19:51,961
My farm, your farm,
it all belonged to his grandpappy,

180
00:19:52,037 --> 00:19:54,562
Teague wanted this place bad,
and you got it,

181
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,438
And he's here sniffin' out an advantage,

182
00:19:59,512 --> 00:20:05,178
 There's no advantage here,
except to celebrate a job well done,

183
00:20:05,284 --> 00:20:07,377
And that is a good thing
in these troubled times,

184
00:20:07,486 --> 00:20:10,580
- Miss Monroe,
- Thank you,

185
00:20:15,394 --> 00:20:20,593
- were you never planning to come inside?
- I'm wetter than a fish,

186
00:20:21,667 --> 00:20:24,932
- There's a good fire going,
- I'm all right,

188
00:20:27,673 --> 00:20:30,574
You're always carrying a tray,

189
00:20:32,811 --> 00:20:36,372
I was going to take some root beer
over to the Negroes,

190
00:20:44,523 --> 00:20:47,458
Somebody said you were enlisting,

191
00:20:47,526 --> 00:20:51,326
- Are you?
- If there is a war, we'll all fight,

192
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:08,277
- Did you get a picture made?
- Say again?

193
00:21:08,347 --> 00:21:12,841
A tintype, with your musket
and your courage on display,

194
00:21:14,219 --> 00:21:16,710
You're laughin' at me,

195
00:21:18,257 --> 00:21:20,657
I don't know you,

196
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:27,763
This doesn't come out right,

197
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:33,362
If it were enough just to stand,
without the words...

198
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:37,131
It is,

199
00:21:40,145 --> 00:21:42,045
It is,

200
00:21:45,751 --> 00:21:48,015
You... look,

201
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:51,487
look, look at the sky now,
what color is it?

202
00:21:53,692 --> 00:21:56,559
Or the way... a hawk flies?

203
00:21:59,231 --> 00:22:02,029
Or you wake up...

204
00:22:02,101 --> 00:22:06,538
and your ribs are bruised
thinking so hard on somebody,

205
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:10,231
what do you call that?

206
00:22:18,817 --> 00:22:20,785
I'll do that,

207
00:22:22,121 --> 00:22:24,851
I can't get much wetter,

208
00:22:27,393 --> 00:22:31,762
 what if you are killed,
and I'll never see you again?

209
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:36,665
You said after a few years
I would barely remember your name.

210
00:22:36,735 --> 00:22:39,226
Oh, Inman.

211
00:22:39,304 --> 00:22:44,071
It is more than three years,
and I remember your name.

212
00:22:45,044 --> 00:22:47,842
Soldiers, Don't get up,

213
00:22:49,948 --> 00:22:52,075
You are mentioned tonight in my report,

214
00:22:52,184 --> 00:22:57,121
You men from Cold Mountain have
once again been heroes for the cause,

215
00:22:57,189 --> 00:23:00,989
There are Yankees in that stand of trees
between us, stuck there from the retreat,

216
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:06,862
If they stay there, tomorrow mornin'
they can shoot us down for sport.

217
00:23:10,035 --> 00:23:12,026
Go around,

218
00:23:14,606 --> 00:23:16,369
-  It's a Reb!

219
00:23:16,442 --> 00:23:17,773
 How many of them are there?

220
00:23:17,843 --> 00:23:19,310
 I think there's five,

221
00:23:19,378 --> 00:23:22,279
 Under the trees,

222
00:23:24,349 --> 00:23:26,340
-  we got 'em,
-  let's go, let's go,

223
00:23:26,418 --> 00:23:28,978
 Butcher's down,

224
00:23:30,022 --> 00:23:34,220
 leave him, leave him,
He's gone, let's go,

225
00:23:35,627 --> 00:23:38,460
 Go, go! Go! Run!

226
00:23:39,698 --> 00:23:43,600
- Go! Go! Go!
-  Hold your fire!

227
00:23:43,669 --> 00:23:45,796
what's over by them trees?

228
00:23:45,871 --> 00:23:48,499
 It's us! It's us!

229
00:23:51,176 --> 00:23:54,111
I said hold your fire! Hold your fire,

231
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:03,652
 leave him, leave him,

232
00:24:04,056 --> 00:24:05,819
Agh!

233
00:24:32,985 --> 00:24:35,385
Inman'll get it.

234
00:24:35,454 --> 00:24:40,255
Supposed to bring good luck,
a bird caught in a room,

235
00:24:40,325 --> 00:24:44,887
 I'm so sorry to have kept you
waiting, She'll just be a few seconds,

238
00:25:49,728 --> 00:25:51,821
- Mr, Inman,
- Reverend,

239
00:25:51,897 --> 00:25:54,730
- what can I do for you?
- I have some sheet music,

240
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:58,258
It belonged to my father,
No use to me,

241
00:25:58,337 --> 00:26:00,032
Thank you,

242
00:26:00,105 --> 00:26:02,335
- You must come in,
- I should probably get along,

243
00:26:02,407 --> 00:26:05,672
Mr, Inman is more comfortable outdoors,

244
00:26:05,744 --> 00:26:09,510
Perhaps we might...
perhaps we might take a walk,

245
00:26:09,581 --> 00:26:11,572
A splendid idea,

246
00:26:14,419 --> 00:26:16,887
let me just get your hat,

247
00:26:20,525 --> 00:26:25,224
I dragged my poor daughter 400 miles
from Charleston to Cold Mountain

248
00:26:25,297 --> 00:26:29,666
because my doctors,
they've been sayin' my chest is weak,

249
00:26:29,735 --> 00:26:32,533
So the air's supposed to do me good,

250
00:26:33,538 --> 00:26:35,938
But it's the view I think heals,

251
00:26:36,008 --> 00:26:40,570
 It's what people say
we're fightin' for, To keep it that way,

252
00:26:40,646 --> 00:26:44,673
I have no plans to preach war
in my church, Mr, Inman,

253
00:26:46,184 --> 00:26:51,918
I imagine God is weary of being called
down on both sides of an argument,

254
00:26:54,092 --> 00:26:56,560
I imagine God is,

255
00:27:02,534 --> 00:27:04,525
Thank you,

256
00:27:06,138 --> 00:27:09,073
Now, your father played the piano, did he?

257
00:27:09,141 --> 00:27:11,336
That's right, He was a teacher,

258
00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:13,844
And is your father living, Mr, Inman?

259
00:27:13,912 --> 00:27:16,142
- He is not,
- And your mother?

260
00:27:16,214 --> 00:27:19,479
No, sir, She died when I was born,

261
00:28:16,308 --> 00:28:19,937
- Secession,
- North Carolina left the Union,

262
00:28:20,012 --> 00:28:26,042
for I don't care to stay here long

264
00:28:27,285 --> 00:28:29,753
- we got our war!
- whoo-hoo!

265
00:28:56,848 --> 00:29:01,444
we got our war! we got it!
we got it! It's about time,

266
00:29:01,553 --> 00:29:03,521
whoo!

267
00:29:05,657 --> 00:29:08,125
- All right!
- Inman! Inman!

268
00:29:08,193 --> 00:29:10,718
Ready to fight, son, ready to fight,

269
00:29:10,796 --> 00:29:11,888
whoo!

270
00:29:11,963 --> 00:29:14,363
we got our war, man,

271
00:29:14,433 --> 00:29:16,924
well, you have your war,

272
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:19,264
Ada,

273
00:29:20,272 --> 00:29:22,103
Ada,

274
00:29:23,241 --> 00:29:26,210
It's a great day for North Carolina,

275
00:29:26,278 --> 00:29:30,305
Those who follow lincoln
or preach abolition...

276
00:29:31,316 --> 00:29:33,443
you best keep one eye open
when you're sleepin',

277
00:29:33,552 --> 00:29:36,715
OI' boogeyman might get you,

278
00:29:36,822 --> 00:29:40,121
Are you the law all of a sudden,
Mr, Teague?

279
00:29:40,192 --> 00:29:42,353
That's right, son,

280
00:29:42,427 --> 00:29:46,420
Home Guard for Haywood County,
And I'm the law from today,

281
00:29:46,498 --> 00:29:51,435
Y'all go fight now,
we'll watch over your sweethearts,

282
00:29:51,503 --> 00:29:53,767
Hey, Teague,
why ain't you fightin'?

283
00:29:53,839 --> 00:29:56,467
'Cause he's too old,

284
00:29:56,541 --> 00:29:58,805
- Yeah!

286
00:30:01,646 --> 00:30:04,706
You might be safer back in Charleston,

287
00:30:08,653 --> 00:30:12,851
- But then who'll be waiting for you?
- Three cheers for North Carolina!

288
00:30:12,924 --> 00:30:15,085
- All right,
- Three cheers for the South!

289
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,457
Hip hip hurrah!

290
00:30:16,795 --> 00:30:18,763
Hip hip hurrah!

291
00:30:19,097 --> 00:30:21,224
Hip hip hurrah!

292
00:30:32,911 --> 00:30:35,812
Inman, It belongs to Inman,

293
00:30:35,881 --> 00:30:38,213
I got it, He's here,

294
00:30:42,487 --> 00:30:47,686
They found that book
you been worryin' about, soldier,

295
00:31:27,132 --> 00:31:28,895
wait,

296
00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:42,678
I found you this book to take with you,

297
00:31:42,747 --> 00:31:44,908
william Bartram,

298
00:31:46,318 --> 00:31:48,786
They tell me it's good,

299
00:31:49,721 --> 00:31:53,919
I think he writes about these parts,
the author, so...

300
00:31:54,926 --> 00:31:56,917
Thank you,

301
00:31:58,463 --> 00:32:00,397
And this,

302
00:32:08,607 --> 00:32:11,167
I'm not smiling in it,

303
00:32:13,979 --> 00:32:16,777
I don't know how to do that,

304
00:32:16,848 --> 00:32:18,839
hold a smile,

306
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:44,431
- Ada,
- what?

308
00:33:07,132 --> 00:33:09,623
- whoa!
- He'll be back in a month,

309
00:33:12,304 --> 00:33:14,636
Kiss her for me,

310
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,139
Come on, let's go,

311
00:33:29,354 --> 00:33:32,255
I'll be waiting for you,

312
00:34:07,826 --> 00:34:09,293
lookin' good, Butcher,

313
00:34:09,361 --> 00:34:11,727
Bring home
some Yankee scalps, Swimmer,

314
00:34:11,796 --> 00:34:13,627
Yee-haw!

315
00:34:18,203 --> 00:34:23,368
look out the window, ladies.
See what these poor fools are dyin' for.

316
00:34:23,441 --> 00:34:27,639
How many would still lose a leg
for the rich man's slave?

317
00:34:28,446 --> 00:34:34,043
Most of these soldiers'll be dead by
morning, or if they're stubborn, by nightfall,

318
00:34:34,152 --> 00:34:38,748
I've other men outside
in the courtyard waitin' for beds,

319
00:34:38,857 --> 00:34:41,485
so any kind word will be a blessin',

321
00:34:44,996 --> 00:34:47,590
It's the heat, I'm sorry, They rot,

322
00:34:47,665 --> 00:34:50,190
Pigeon River...

323
00:34:50,268 --> 00:34:52,964
How are you, son?

324
00:34:53,037 --> 00:34:56,029
Cold... Mountain...

325
00:34:58,410 --> 00:35:00,742
I-I'm sorry,

326
00:35:00,812 --> 00:35:05,181
- You want water?
- Cold... Mountain,

327
00:35:07,051 --> 00:35:09,383
Cold Mountain?

328
00:35:10,054 --> 00:35:12,022
Cold Mountain,

329
00:35:15,427 --> 00:35:21,332
Do you worry when there's no word
from him? From Mr, Inman?

330
00:35:22,967 --> 00:35:24,798
Yes,

331
00:35:27,138 --> 00:35:29,800
But then I've tried countin'
the number of words

332
00:35:29,874 --> 00:35:34,811
which have passed between Mr, Inman
and me - not very many,

333
00:35:34,879 --> 00:35:39,111
But I think about him, Daddy, all the time,

334
00:35:39,217 --> 00:35:43,415
I lost your mother
after 22 months of marriage,

335
00:35:45,356 --> 00:35:47,824
It was enough to fill a life,

336
00:35:54,032 --> 00:35:56,159
 That was the last of the ham,

337
00:35:56,234 --> 00:35:59,635
-  It was delicious,
- I have to learn how to cook,

338
00:35:59,704 --> 00:36:02,070
I was thinking of saying
something in chapel,

339
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:04,165
Perhaps some of the womenfolk
will volunteer,

340
00:36:04,242 --> 00:36:07,575
I can't have people coming here
and cooking for me,

341
00:36:09,447 --> 00:36:10,846
I so...

342
00:36:10,915 --> 00:36:12,507
I so regret...

343
00:36:12,617 --> 00:36:18,920
I should have raised you less like a
companion and more like a young woman,

344
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:23,154
I'm sorry, Ada,
And for dragging you here,

345
00:36:23,228 --> 00:36:25,219
I'm not sorry,

346
00:36:28,433 --> 00:36:31,231
I would have followed you anywhere,

347
00:36:33,671 --> 00:36:36,333
- To Mongolia,
- Mongolia,

348
00:36:37,509 --> 00:36:42,776
But with no one left to work this place,
nothing to buy, nothing left to buy it with...

349
00:36:44,382 --> 00:36:48,341
I just don't know how we're gonna
get through another winter,

350
00:36:51,122 --> 00:36:56,890
will you play me somethin'? Somethin'
peaceful while I look over my sermon,

351
00:36:56,961 --> 00:36:59,088
It's too damp out here,
You should come inside,

352
00:36:59,163 --> 00:37:00,858
No,

353
00:37:00,932 --> 00:37:03,093
I like it,

354
00:37:17,749 --> 00:37:20,741
Daddy, bring the tablecloth in,

355
00:37:23,354 --> 00:37:25,822
Come inside before you drown,

359
00:38:13,571 --> 00:38:15,766
You have a letter,

360
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,831
North Carolina,

361
00:38:19,577 --> 00:38:22,171
It's come a long way,

362
00:38:25,049 --> 00:38:27,381
It's not too recent,

363
00:38:27,485 --> 00:38:29,953
It's written this past winter,

364
00:38:32,256 --> 00:38:34,690
I'm afraid I can't read who it's from,

365
00:38:39,464 --> 00:38:41,898
Dear Mr, Inman...

366
00:38:42,634 --> 00:38:48,266
 Since you've left, time has been
measured out in bitter chapters.

367
00:38:48,339 --> 00:38:51,001
last fall, my poor father died.

368
00:38:52,944 --> 00:38:55,845
Our farm at Black Cove is abandoned.

369
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:02,811
Every house in these mountains
touched by tragedy.

370
00:39:05,223 --> 00:39:10,092
Each day the dread...
of learning who has fallen...

371
00:39:11,295 --> 00:39:14,264
who will not return from this terrible war.

372
00:39:16,334 --> 00:39:19,303
And no word from you.

373
00:39:19,370 --> 00:39:21,497
Are you alive?

374
00:39:21,572 --> 00:39:24,370
I pray to God you are.

375
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:27,776
This war is lost on the battlefield

376
00:39:27,845 --> 00:39:32,612
and is being lost twice over
by those who stayed behind.

377
00:39:32,717 --> 00:39:36,175
He ain't comin' back, you know that,

378
00:39:40,358 --> 00:39:42,952
You must know that in your heart,

379
00:39:45,663 --> 00:39:47,824
look at me,

380
00:39:49,467 --> 00:39:51,799
- look at me,

381
00:39:56,607 --> 00:39:59,235
I'm not nothin',

382
00:40:01,446 --> 00:40:05,849
 I'm still waiting,
as I promised I would.

383
00:40:08,619 --> 00:40:12,555
But I find myself alone
and at the end of my wits...

384
00:40:13,691 --> 00:40:18,355
too embarrassed to keep taking
from those who can least afford to give.

385
00:40:19,497 --> 00:40:22,466
Ada! It's Sally!

386
00:40:22,533 --> 00:40:23,761
Ada!

387
00:40:23,835 --> 00:40:26,099
look at the state of this place,

388
00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:29,731
- well, set it on the porch,

389
00:40:31,242 --> 00:40:34,769
She let them slaves go free,
and now...

390
00:40:34,846 --> 00:40:39,681
Poor soul, she's got nobody and nothin',
and waitin' on a ghost,

393
00:40:45,990 --> 00:40:47,981
Shoo!

395
00:40:50,595 --> 00:40:52,563
Go away,

397
00:40:57,568 --> 00:40:58,967
Devil!

398
00:41:02,473 --> 00:41:07,001
My last thread of courage now
is to put my faith in you...

399
00:41:09,447 --> 00:41:12,211
and to believe I will see you again.

400
00:41:13,417 --> 00:41:17,854
So now I say to you, plain as I can...

401
00:41:19,323 --> 00:41:22,588
if you are fighting, stop fighting.

402
00:41:23,828 --> 00:41:27,195
If you are marching, stop marching.

403
00:41:29,233 --> 00:41:31,724
Come back to me,

404
00:41:35,273 --> 00:41:37,605
Come back to me is my request,

405
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:48,412
Come back to me.

406
00:41:49,921 --> 00:41:53,357
Come back to me is my request.

407
00:41:55,827 --> 00:41:59,786
wounded men, don't stray
from the hospital grounds,

408
00:42:00,364 --> 00:42:02,355
Hey!

409
00:42:04,235 --> 00:42:05,725
If they send us back to fight...

410
00:42:05,803 --> 00:42:09,739
Hey, get your peanuts now,
from the blind man,

411
00:42:11,175 --> 00:42:14,633
- Hey, your hot goobers here,
- It's a sad day,

412
00:42:18,583 --> 00:42:21,416
Gettin' better, soldier?

413
00:42:21,519 --> 00:42:24,215
Seems that way,

414
00:42:24,322 --> 00:42:26,290
I wouldn't hurry,

415
00:42:26,390 --> 00:42:30,417
The war's almost done,
Don't need your help to lose it,


417
00:42:31,629 --> 00:42:36,692
You got ten minutes now, boys, Ten
minutes to get your haircuts and shaves,

418
00:42:36,767 --> 00:42:39,634
I've been meanin' to ask you,
where'd you take your wound?

419
00:42:39,704 --> 00:42:42,070
Oh, before I was born,

420
00:42:42,139 --> 00:42:44,573
Never set eyes on a thing in this world,

421
00:42:44,642 --> 00:42:50,137
Not a tree, a gun or a woman,
Put my hand on all three, though,

423
00:42:51,916 --> 00:42:54,714
- what would you give for that?
- Hm?

424
00:42:54,819 --> 00:42:59,222
- To have your eyeballs for ten minutes,
- Ten minutes?

425
00:42:59,290 --> 00:43:01,815
I wouldn't give an Indian head cent,

426
00:43:01,893 --> 00:43:05,920
- Might turn me hateful,
- That's sure what seein's done to me,

427
00:43:05,997 --> 00:43:08,932
No, that's not the way I meant it,

428
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,560
You said ten minutes,

429
00:43:11,636 --> 00:43:16,073
It's havin' a thing and then
the loss of it I'm talking about,

430
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:21,806
Then we don't agree, There's not much I
wouldn't give for ten minutes of someplace,

431
00:43:21,879 --> 00:43:25,975
Yeah, someplace... or someone,

432
00:43:29,053 --> 00:43:32,022
You watch yourself, now,

433
00:43:32,123 --> 00:43:35,115
They're shootin' men
who take themselves a walk,

435
00:44:13,965 --> 00:44:17,025
By order of Zebulon Vance,

436
00:44:17,101 --> 00:44:20,002
governor of this great state
of North Carolina,

437
00:44:20,638 --> 00:44:25,803
any soldier turned deserter
is guilty of treason,

438
00:44:25,876 --> 00:44:28,777
and should be hunted down like a dog,

439
00:44:30,147 --> 00:44:35,551
Any man who takes in a deserter
is likewise guilty of treason,

440
00:44:35,619 --> 00:44:41,956
The Home Guard is powered to enter any
place it sees fit without notice or constraint,

441
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:45,929
Captain Teague needs more volunteers,

442
00:44:45,997 --> 00:44:50,195
Any man whose age or infirmity
prevents him from fightin' shall join us

443
00:44:50,267 --> 00:44:54,863
to protect this county from Yankee raiders
and traitors to the cause,

444
00:44:54,939 --> 00:44:56,736
- Is there a letter for me?
- Nothin',

445
00:44:56,807 --> 00:45:01,676
we've been gettin' no post through at all,
The sooner we lose this war the better,

446
00:45:01,746 --> 00:45:04,977
They say not one boy in ten
is comin' home to these mountains,

447
00:45:05,049 --> 00:45:10,180
Teague and his rabble throwin' their weight
around, They're worse than the Yankees,

448
00:45:10,287 --> 00:45:12,915
Might I speak with you, please?

449
00:45:14,525 --> 00:45:17,085
This was the Reverend Monroe's,

450
00:45:19,830 --> 00:45:22,628
I don't know who would want a watch,

451
00:45:24,802 --> 00:45:26,929
who can bear to look at the time?

452
00:45:30,341 --> 00:45:33,504
I've got a little salt pork you can have,

453
00:45:35,212 --> 00:45:37,612
Keep your daddy's watch,

454
00:45:39,283 --> 00:45:41,649
Thank you,

455
00:45:43,554 --> 00:45:45,351
I was talkin' to some of the other womenfolk

456
00:45:45,423 --> 00:45:48,187
about maybe lookin' in on you
at Black Cove, It's hard right now, but...

457
00:45:48,259 --> 00:45:52,127
Oh, no, I manage very well,
whatever the talk is,

458
00:45:54,498 --> 00:45:56,989
I'm very grateful for the pork,

459
00:45:59,370 --> 00:46:02,533
which I intend to pay for, of course,

460
00:46:11,115 --> 00:46:13,811
Is everything all right?

461
00:46:13,918 --> 00:46:15,715
Mm-hmm,

462
00:46:30,468 --> 00:46:32,265
 Ada,

463
00:46:32,336 --> 00:46:34,167
Ada,

464
00:46:36,107 --> 00:46:39,668
why, Ada, you are skinny
as a whippet, girl,

465
00:46:39,743 --> 00:46:43,201
- You are comin' indoors with me,
- No, I can't,

466
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:45,271
I don't...

467
00:46:46,517 --> 00:46:48,610
I can't keep countin' on your kindness,

468
00:46:48,719 --> 00:46:50,744
Now, come on, I'm makin' a stew,

469
00:46:50,855 --> 00:46:55,758
we'd be proud to have you,
Esco's gonna be wantin' his dinner,

470
00:46:57,061 --> 00:47:00,497
I just wanna stop, I tell you, Yeah,

471
00:47:00,564 --> 00:47:05,001
Sit on the porch with Sal,
watch my boys in the fields,

472
00:47:05,069 --> 00:47:09,005
holler Good job every hour or so,

473
00:47:09,073 --> 00:47:12,839
That'll be a good day,
when our boys get home,

474
00:47:12,910 --> 00:47:15,970
what about your people in Charleston?

475
00:47:18,916 --> 00:47:21,680
There are no people,

476
00:47:21,785 --> 00:47:24,447
And there's no money,

477
00:47:24,555 --> 00:47:28,548
My father had some bonds
and investments,

478
00:47:28,659 --> 00:47:32,322
They're worthless now, of course,
The war...

479
00:47:33,898 --> 00:47:38,801
They're not worth anything,
I don't have anywhere else to go,

480
00:47:44,475 --> 00:47:46,739
I don't wanna go,

481
00:47:48,879 --> 00:47:51,939
- You're waiting on a feller,
-  Oh!

482
00:47:54,952 --> 00:47:57,011
- look down our well...
- Esco...

483
00:47:57,121 --> 00:47:59,089
She should,

484
00:47:59,890 --> 00:48:05,192
If you look down our well with a mirror,
you'll see the future, It's what they say,

485
00:48:06,730 --> 00:48:09,460
You do it,
She does it,

486
00:48:11,769 --> 00:48:13,464
what kind of mirror?

487
00:48:14,638 --> 00:48:18,369
- we'll hold on to you, Esco, you hold on,
- I got her,

488
00:48:18,442 --> 00:48:20,933
-  we got you,
-  Mm,

489
00:48:22,513 --> 00:48:24,504
See anything?

492
00:48:30,454 --> 00:48:33,423
-  I don't know,
-  I tried many a time,

493
00:48:33,524 --> 00:48:36,823
lookin' for a sign
my boys were comin' home,

494
00:48:36,894 --> 00:48:39,294
I never saw a dickey bird,

495
00:48:54,378 --> 00:48:57,279
- Oh!
-  Are you all right? Ada?

496
00:48:57,348 --> 00:49:00,283
what? what happened?

497
00:49:02,052 --> 00:49:04,714
what'd you see? what'd you see?

498
00:49:05,789 --> 00:49:09,122
Yesterday,
I saw you walkin' back to me...

499
00:49:09,927 --> 00:49:12,259
or thought I did.

500
00:49:13,197 --> 00:49:17,634
I found myself crouching
over Sally Swanger's well...

502
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:26,507
...like a madwoman
staring into its secrets.

503
00:49:28,579 --> 00:49:34,142
was it you I saw walking home to me,
or was it your ghost?

504
00:49:34,251 --> 00:49:38,381
After so long, I know I must learn
to survive on my own

505
00:49:38,489 --> 00:49:41,617
and accept you will not return.

506
00:49:41,692 --> 00:49:45,093
And yet I cannot. I cannot.

509
00:49:50,734 --> 00:49:52,964
Them cows wants milkin',

510
00:49:53,037 --> 00:49:56,302
If that letter ain't urgent,
them cows is is what I'm sayin',

511
00:49:56,373 --> 00:49:58,398
I don't know you,

512
00:49:58,475 --> 00:50:01,672
Old lady Swanger says you need help,

513
00:50:01,745 --> 00:50:04,646
Here I am,

514
00:50:04,715 --> 00:50:09,652
I... I need help but... I need...
I do need help, but I need a laborer,

515
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:14,714
There's... there's plowing and rough work,
I think there's been a misunderstanding,

516
00:50:14,825 --> 00:50:17,692
what's that rake for?

517
00:50:17,761 --> 00:50:20,525
- The rake?
- well, it ain't for gardenin', that's for sure,

518
00:50:20,597 --> 00:50:24,226
Number one, you got a horse?
I can plow all day, I'm a worker,

519
00:50:24,301 --> 00:50:26,735
Number two, ain't no man better'n me,

520
00:50:26,804 --> 00:50:31,070
'cause there ain't no man around
who ain't old or full of mischief,

521
00:50:32,476 --> 00:50:36,071
- I know your plight,
- My plight?

522
00:50:36,146 --> 00:50:39,673
Am I hard to hear?
'Cause you keep repeatin' everything,

523
00:50:39,783 --> 00:50:43,378
I ain't lookin' for money, I never cared for it
and now it ain't worth nothin',

524
00:50:43,487 --> 00:50:46,718
I expect to board and eat,
at the same table,

525
00:50:46,790 --> 00:50:49,953
- I ain't a servant, if you get my meanin',
- You're not a servant,

526
00:50:50,027 --> 00:50:54,726
People's gonna have to empty
their own night jars is my point,

527
00:50:54,798 --> 00:50:57,665
And I don't expect to work
whilst you sit around and watch, neither,

528
00:50:57,735 --> 00:50:58,861
Right,

529
00:50:58,936 --> 00:51:01,769
Right, Is that a yes or a no?

531
00:51:04,308 --> 00:51:07,368
There's a rooster,
He's the devil, I'm sure of it,

532
00:51:07,444 --> 00:51:10,004
I go near him
and he is at me with his spurs,

533
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:12,275
He's lucifer himself,

534
00:51:12,349 --> 00:51:15,682
- I despise a floggin' rooster,

535
00:51:16,653 --> 00:51:18,621
Oh, no, I wouldn't...

536
00:51:18,722 --> 00:51:21,691
My name's Ruby Thewes,
I know your name,

539
00:51:31,135 --> 00:51:33,626
let's put him in a pot,

541
00:51:59,630 --> 00:52:01,393
Urgh!

542
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:41,203
You're my angel, my butterfly,

543
00:52:42,606 --> 00:52:45,097
Come fly away,

545
00:52:47,878 --> 00:52:50,813
My love...

546
00:52:50,881 --> 00:52:53,873
God forgive me for doin' this,

547
00:52:53,951 --> 00:52:56,181
I'm so sorry,

548
00:52:56,286 --> 00:52:59,050
I'm sendin' you to a better place,

550
00:53:00,991 --> 00:53:03,926
You go fly away,

551
00:53:03,994 --> 00:53:05,894
Hey!

552
00:53:05,963 --> 00:53:11,026
- Don't do that,
- Don't pull that trigger, I'm a man of God,

553
00:53:11,101 --> 00:53:15,629
- I killed several of them,
- I mean I'm God's minister,

554
00:53:15,706 --> 00:53:19,733
what part of God's business
is throwin' a woman down a gorge?

555
00:53:19,810 --> 00:53:22,108
A slave woman,

556
00:53:22,179 --> 00:53:25,979
Can you see that in this light?
Black as a bucket of tar,

557
00:53:26,049 --> 00:53:29,018
- Is she dead?
- No, I drugged her,

558
00:53:29,086 --> 00:53:31,316
like you would a butterfly,

559
00:53:31,421 --> 00:53:34,390
And I care for her,
That's the heartbreak of it,

560
00:53:35,125 --> 00:53:38,117
She's got my bastard in her belly,

561
00:53:38,195 --> 00:53:40,663
Come on, Back up,

563
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:45,391
- I'm beggin' you,
- Git,

564
00:53:45,469 --> 00:53:51,135
It's better you blow out my brains
than return me to this place,

565
00:53:52,042 --> 00:53:55,136
You're gonna put her back
where she sleeps,

566
00:53:56,246 --> 00:53:59,409
I do that, the members will lynch me

567
00:53:59,483 --> 00:54:03,977
for sirin' a bastard while servin' as
their preacher, we're a strict congregation,

568
00:54:04,087 --> 00:54:07,784
we've churched men
for pickin' up a fiddle on the Sabbath,

569
00:54:07,858 --> 00:54:10,759
So you reckon to kill her?
what, because she's a slave?

571
00:54:13,263 --> 00:54:14,992
I... um...

572
00:54:15,065 --> 00:54:17,465
There's a back door, Have pity,

573
00:54:19,736 --> 00:54:21,966
Thank you,

574
00:54:22,039 --> 00:54:24,701
I was gonna do a grievous wrong,

575
00:54:27,377 --> 00:54:30,278
I think I should go back up to my wife,

576
00:54:31,882 --> 00:54:33,975
She wakes at the slightest noise,

577
00:54:34,084 --> 00:54:36,018
Agh! Ohh...

578
00:54:36,086 --> 00:54:38,077
where's some paper and a pencil?

580
00:54:49,199 --> 00:54:52,862
 - Hey, Ada! You up?

581
00:54:54,571 --> 00:54:55,902
- Yes,

582
00:54:55,973 --> 00:54:58,498
wha...? It's still dark,

583
00:54:58,575 --> 00:55:01,305
Tell that to the cows, It's late,

584
00:55:08,218 --> 00:55:10,516
You all set?

585
00:55:10,621 --> 00:55:12,680
Oh, I-I just have to eat somethin',

586
00:55:12,789 --> 00:55:15,758
well, then, you got to get up earlier,
what's that?

587
00:55:17,761 --> 00:55:20,025
A novel,

588
00:55:20,097 --> 00:55:23,430
You wanna carry a book,
carry one you can write in,

589
00:55:24,868 --> 00:55:31,103
we got our own story,
It's called Black Cove Farm: Catastrophe.

590
00:55:32,175 --> 00:55:36,635
I can spell it, too, learned it the same place
you did, in the schoolhouse,

591
00:55:36,713 --> 00:55:39,273
One of the first words they taught me,

592
00:55:39,349 --> 00:55:44,787
Ruby Thewes,
you are a c-a-t-a-s-t-r-o-p-h-e,

593
00:55:44,855 --> 00:55:47,551
Three years I was in school,
before my daddy...

594
00:55:47,624 --> 00:55:50,991
Sayin' God rest his soul is like
wishin' him what he had in life,

595
00:55:51,061 --> 00:55:53,894
He lived to rest, He was born tired,

596
00:55:53,964 --> 00:55:56,455
He decided... better use for me

597
00:55:56,533 --> 00:56:00,299
than havin' me sat all day
in front of a chalkboard,


600
00:56:07,644 --> 00:56:13,082
Number one, lay out a winter garden
for cool-season crops,

601
00:56:13,150 --> 00:56:16,677
Turnips right there, onions, cabbage,

602
00:56:19,022 --> 00:56:20,182
Collards,

603
00:56:20,290 --> 00:56:23,919
Number two,
patch the shingles on the barn roof,

604
00:56:23,994 --> 00:56:26,292
Have we got a maul and frow?

605
00:56:26,363 --> 00:56:30,231
- Maul?
- Maul, M-a-u-L,

606
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:33,497
Number three, clear and turn this field,

607
00:56:40,343 --> 00:56:43,938
No harm done lettin' it go,
Now we'll do well,

608
00:56:44,781 --> 00:56:45,873
Number 15...

609
00:56:45,949 --> 00:56:46,847
16,

610
00:56:46,950 --> 00:56:48,349
- Number 16...
- Number 16...

611
00:56:48,452 --> 00:56:52,912
Put up some gourds for a martin colony,
Keep away these crows,

612
00:56:53,023 --> 00:56:58,120
One thing in abundance on this farm,
and that's crows, Shut the gate,

614
00:57:41,371 --> 00:57:44,033
I'd pay a dollar for an egg,

615
00:57:45,108 --> 00:57:47,702
I've got no quarrel with you,

616
00:57:47,778 --> 00:57:49,245
Hey!

617
00:57:50,213 --> 00:57:53,205
Am I near the Cape Fear River?

618
00:58:25,148 --> 00:58:28,208
- Home Guard! Get back there!

619
00:58:28,318 --> 00:58:29,979
- Runaways!

621
00:58:35,492 --> 00:58:37,460
Come on, boys!

622
00:58:38,762 --> 00:58:40,457
let's get 'em!

623
00:58:40,530 --> 00:58:43,363
 They're spreadin' out in the field!

624
00:58:47,437 --> 00:58:49,598
- Come back here!
-  They're in the field,

625
00:58:49,673 --> 00:58:52,164
They're in the field!

627
00:59:01,985 --> 00:59:04,351
I can get you outta here,

628
00:59:09,926 --> 00:59:13,054
I daresay that's Home Guard followin' you,

629
00:59:13,129 --> 00:59:16,963
They're out on the road,
huntin' down deserters,

630
00:59:17,033 --> 00:59:19,365
And I don't recommend that way,

631
00:59:19,436 --> 00:59:23,236
You'll meet half the town comin' after me
with a noose, thanks to you,

632
00:59:23,306 --> 00:59:26,104
I should have shot you
when I had the chance,

633
00:59:26,176 --> 00:59:30,613
I know where there's a ferry crossin',
Or you can stubborn yourself to death,

634
00:59:32,048 --> 00:59:37,577
-  If this is a trap...
- Please yourself, I'm just bein' a Christian,

635
00:59:37,687 --> 00:59:40,247
- You got any money?
- $5,

636
00:59:40,357 --> 00:59:43,952
For $5 I wouldn't give a parched man
a dipper of this river water,

637
00:59:44,027 --> 00:59:46,154
The sign says Ferry $5,

638
00:59:46,229 --> 00:59:51,189
Nobody crosses these waters
unless they're runnin' from someplace,

639
00:59:52,102 --> 00:59:54,570
You wanna wait for your friends?

640
00:59:54,638 --> 00:59:56,833
I can give you $30 Confederate,

641
00:59:56,907 --> 00:59:59,239
well, all right, let's go,

642
00:59:59,309 --> 01:00:01,300
whatever that's worth,

643
01:00:06,283 --> 01:00:08,308
They cut off my hair,

644
01:00:09,686 --> 01:00:12,314
That was hard,

645
01:00:12,422 --> 01:00:14,481
I was vain about my hair,

646
01:00:15,292 --> 01:00:17,783
I had curls,

647
01:00:18,428 --> 01:00:21,261
But I deserved it,

648
01:00:21,331 --> 01:00:26,166
I'm the Reverend Veasey,
Have I seen you in church?

649
01:00:26,236 --> 01:00:29,069
No, Not likely to, neither,

650
01:00:29,139 --> 01:00:33,439
I'd say these days, the devil rules the roost,

651
01:00:36,279 --> 01:00:38,577
30 more dollars,
we can go over to that cabin

652
01:00:38,648 --> 01:00:41,776
and I can pull this dress over my head,

653
01:00:44,020 --> 01:00:46,386
Have we got $30?

655
01:00:48,291 --> 01:00:52,159
- Get down!
-  I got one,

656
01:01:00,370 --> 01:01:04,397
- Is there any other way to cross?
- Barge or boat, The water's full of gators,

657
01:01:05,842 --> 01:01:07,867
what's this wood?

658
01:01:07,944 --> 01:01:10,435
- I don't know,
- In,

659
01:01:11,281 --> 01:01:12,771
- I don't know,
- Pine,

660
01:01:12,849 --> 01:01:16,341
- locust?
- Pine, where's north?

661
01:01:16,453 --> 01:01:19,445
North? Uh...

662
01:01:20,490 --> 01:01:23,186
Name me three herbs
that grow wild on this farm,

663
01:01:23,259 --> 01:01:25,727
I can't, I can't, all right?

664
01:01:27,063 --> 01:01:30,430
I can talk about farming in latin,

665
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:34,129
I can... I can read French,

666
01:01:34,204 --> 01:01:37,071
I know how to lace up a corset,
God knows,

667
01:01:37,140 --> 01:01:39,267
I can name the principal rivers in Europe,

668
01:01:39,342 --> 01:01:42,903
Just don't ask me
to name one stream in this county!

669
01:01:42,979 --> 01:01:46,073
I can... I can embroider
but I can't darn!

670
01:01:46,149 --> 01:01:50,210
I can arrange cut flowers
but I can't grow them!

671
01:01:52,555 --> 01:01:55,490
If a thing has a function,
if I might do something with it,

672
01:01:55,558 --> 01:01:58,994
then it wasn't considered suitable!

673
01:02:01,197 --> 01:02:03,188
why?

674
01:02:05,335 --> 01:02:08,827
Ruby, you can ask why about
pretty much everything to do with me,

675
01:02:12,709 --> 01:02:17,112
This fence is about the first thing
that I've ever done

676
01:02:17,180 --> 01:02:20,149
that might produce an actual result,

678
01:02:30,894 --> 01:02:34,557
So you never wrapped your legs
around this Inman?

680
01:02:40,870 --> 01:02:42,861
Come on,

683
01:03:27,817 --> 01:03:29,512
Fine piano,

687
01:03:55,278 --> 01:03:59,044
If we're careful,
now we'll get through winter,

688
01:03:59,115 --> 01:04:01,549
I got old man Roy
to give me ten of them sheep,

689
01:04:01,651 --> 01:04:03,642
on account of I said they's so small,

690
01:04:03,753 --> 01:04:07,519
put together they weren't no bigger
than six proper sheep,

691
01:04:07,590 --> 01:04:10,787
My father
always wanted sheep on this farm,

692
01:04:14,130 --> 01:04:16,758
I cut off my hair once for money,

693
01:04:16,833 --> 01:04:22,703
My daddy got $ 2 for it,
Made a wig for some rich feller in Raleigh,

694
01:04:24,807 --> 01:04:28,208
I'm just sayin'
I'm real sorry you had to lose your piano,

695
01:04:28,278 --> 01:04:30,246
Ruby, it was my idea,

696
01:04:30,313 --> 01:04:33,407
Stobrod liked to call himself a musician,

697
01:04:33,483 --> 01:04:38,045
My daddy,
He could play six tunes on a fiddle,

698
01:04:38,154 --> 01:04:41,646
Got hisself shot dead at Petersburg,

699
01:04:42,625 --> 01:04:45,253
I was like his goat,

700
01:04:45,328 --> 01:04:47,796
Or some critter tethered to a post,

701
01:04:51,634 --> 01:04:54,603
He left me once,
Up in them mountains,

702
01:04:54,671 --> 01:04:57,139
I was eight,
He was gone over two and a half weeks,

703
01:04:57,207 --> 01:04:59,539
He left you?

704
01:05:01,878 --> 01:05:05,075
Uh-huh, I was all right,

705
01:05:05,148 --> 01:05:10,950
My daddy, he'd walk 40 miles for liquor
and not 40 inches for kindness,

706
01:05:13,022 --> 01:05:15,718
I'm so plugged up,

707
01:05:15,792 --> 01:05:19,558
Used to be as regular as morning prayers,

708
01:05:19,629 --> 01:05:23,292
Matter of fact,
I could set my watch by my bowels,

709
01:05:24,801 --> 01:05:31,502
Open my gut now, they'd find turds
stacked up like little black twigs,

710
01:05:32,909 --> 01:05:34,900
Home Guard!

712
01:05:48,858 --> 01:05:50,792
- Hey,
- Shh,

713
01:05:50,860 --> 01:05:53,829
- look at this,
- Keep your voice down,

714
01:05:55,064 --> 01:05:57,055
look at this!

715
01:05:58,968 --> 01:06:01,630
- It's a good saw!
- And it's not yours,

716
01:06:02,839 --> 01:06:06,900
You're a Christian,
Don't you know your Commandments?

717
01:06:07,910 --> 01:06:12,870
You'll find the good lord
very flexible on the subject of property,

718
01:06:13,916 --> 01:06:16,612
we could do a lot with this saw,

719
01:06:16,719 --> 01:06:20,780
Cut down a tree,
Play music with it,

720
01:06:22,325 --> 01:06:24,657
You're gonna thank me for this saw,

721
01:06:24,727 --> 01:06:28,561
I'll say thank you when I've lost you
and I've found some food,

722
01:06:28,631 --> 01:06:30,861
You'll see,
You'll thank me,

723
01:06:42,278 --> 01:06:44,212
Shh,

724
01:06:48,851 --> 01:06:50,876
Good day to you,

725
01:06:57,760 --> 01:07:03,096
My old bull... wandered off...
and died in this here creek,

726
01:07:03,166 --> 01:07:06,693
Poisonin' up our water
is how I found him,

727
01:07:09,806 --> 01:07:12,639
Thank you,
You are a true Christian,

728
01:07:14,143 --> 01:07:18,773
- That's a rank odor from that animal,
- Been dead a good while, I reckon,

729
01:07:19,716 --> 01:07:22,207
- This is a tricky one,

730
01:07:24,687 --> 01:07:28,646
You fellers help me out,
my woman'll cook you up a good dinner,

731
01:07:28,758 --> 01:07:31,056
I'm gettin' an idea,

732
01:07:32,562 --> 01:07:34,757
My saw's the remedy,

733
01:07:34,831 --> 01:07:38,426
I believe you need two people,
one on either end,

734
01:07:38,501 --> 01:07:39,991
Yeah,

735
01:07:40,069 --> 01:07:42,060
Give me that saw,

736
01:07:47,977 --> 01:07:49,444
let's do this in chapters,

737
01:07:49,512 --> 01:07:51,139
- That's right,
- Yeah,

738
01:07:51,214 --> 01:07:54,012
Start at the neck,

739
01:07:54,517 --> 01:07:56,485
Aw...!

741
01:07:59,122 --> 01:08:01,682
Oh, well... That is unpleasant,

742
01:08:03,292 --> 01:08:05,760
There's my place,

743
01:08:05,828 --> 01:08:09,423
Hope you can stomach
a yard chock full of female,

744
01:08:09,499 --> 01:08:12,468
Oh, God, Oh, my God,

745
01:08:12,535 --> 01:08:14,127
Hallelujah,

746
01:08:14,203 --> 01:08:19,197
Hallelujah! Oh, hallelujah!
The Israelites!

747
01:08:19,275 --> 01:08:20,867
 what happened?

748
01:08:20,943 --> 01:08:23,104
He's got a shit comin',
It's overdue,

749
01:08:23,179 --> 01:08:28,981
The tribes of Israel are about to flee
from the banks of Egypt!

750
01:08:29,952 --> 01:08:31,749
Good God,

751
01:08:31,854 --> 01:08:34,652
These boys are stoppin' for supper!

752
01:08:40,696 --> 01:08:42,220
Brought my woman home,

753
01:08:42,298 --> 01:08:46,792
she showed up with her three sisters,
so-called, and their brats,

754
01:08:46,869 --> 01:08:49,167
That's Mae, Dolly, Shyla,

755
01:08:49,238 --> 01:08:52,071
and the pretty one in blue is my wife, lila,

756
01:08:54,510 --> 01:08:56,808
Those are fine examples of the female,

759
01:09:16,432 --> 01:09:21,927
 My home brew sneaks up on you,
It curdles your durdles,

760
01:09:22,004 --> 01:09:24,529
Oh, Oh, look, He's gone now,

761
01:09:24,607 --> 01:09:26,598
look, He's gone now,

762
01:09:27,543 --> 01:09:29,636
His eyes, they've gone,

763
01:09:29,712 --> 01:09:32,510
- His eyes are gone,
- what?

764
01:09:32,582 --> 01:09:36,643
- Gone, gone, gone, gone!

765
01:09:40,223 --> 01:09:44,182
I'm leavin' soon as I'm full,
Y'all havin' too much fun for me,

766
01:09:44,293 --> 01:09:46,124
Really? Goodbye,

767
01:09:46,195 --> 01:09:49,824
well, yeah,
I got a bunch of traps need visitin',

768
01:09:49,899 --> 01:09:53,528
but I'll be back before...
before dark tomorrow,

769
01:09:53,603 --> 01:09:57,232
- Y'all still be here?
- That's my fervent prayer,

770
01:09:57,306 --> 01:10:01,140
I'll say my goodbyes,
I gotta go,

771
01:10:01,210 --> 01:10:07,877
I got miles and miles and miles and miles
ahead of me before I reach the Blue Ridge,

772
01:10:07,950 --> 01:10:10,180
Blue Ridge? what's the hurry?

773
01:10:10,286 --> 01:10:13,722
- Maybe I willjust lie down a moment,
- Yeah,

774
01:10:13,823 --> 01:10:18,419
- This house is on a bit of a tilt,
- Yeah, it is a bit crooked,

776
01:10:22,532 --> 01:10:24,193
lie down,

777
01:10:24,267 --> 01:10:26,258
what about you, Reverend?

778
01:10:27,837 --> 01:10:30,863
I'm headin' for that smokehouse,

779
01:10:30,940 --> 01:10:33,272
And I'm ready
to be washed clean of my dirt,

780
01:10:33,342 --> 01:10:36,402
- Yeah, Mae, you go tend to him,
- Mm-hm,

781
01:10:36,479 --> 01:10:37,468
All right,

782
01:10:37,547 --> 01:10:40,107
Y'all get to bed,

783
01:10:40,182 --> 01:10:42,673
Everybody else got their job,

784
01:10:42,785 --> 01:10:44,753
- Come on, get to bed,
- Now?

785
01:10:44,854 --> 01:10:48,381
Everybody to bed,
lila, you stay with them kids,

786
01:10:48,491 --> 01:10:50,755
Get on up those stairs,

787
01:10:50,826 --> 01:10:52,691
I'll be seein' you.

788
01:10:53,429 --> 01:10:56,489
look...

789
01:10:56,566 --> 01:11:00,525
He's mine,
You go rub yourself off on the preacher,

790
01:11:00,603 --> 01:11:04,164
I'm gonna make him hug me till I grunt,

791
01:11:04,240 --> 01:11:07,107
He's purty, ain't he?

792
01:11:07,977 --> 01:11:10,104
Git,

793
01:11:10,179 --> 01:11:13,171
She ain't even supposed to get a man,

794
01:11:15,384 --> 01:11:17,352
Hey,

796
01:11:24,894 --> 01:11:26,885
I know, I know,

797
01:11:28,464 --> 01:11:30,455
I...

798
01:11:31,801 --> 01:11:33,826
How about that?

799
01:11:33,903 --> 01:11:36,872
- what does that favor?
- I...

800
01:11:38,507 --> 01:11:41,670
- ... gotta go,
- Get on,

801
01:11:41,744 --> 01:11:46,078
And ride me all the way to China,

803
01:11:58,828 --> 01:12:00,318
You shy?

804
01:12:00,396 --> 01:12:02,990
- Do you need a hand?
- No, Uh...

805
01:12:03,065 --> 01:12:06,364
let's have a look
and see what we can muster,

806
01:12:07,103 --> 01:12:10,095
Oh, no,
look what you made me do,

807
01:12:12,308 --> 01:12:14,208
Slut!

808
01:12:14,276 --> 01:12:16,506
Home Guard!

809
01:12:16,579 --> 01:12:18,274
Cover yourself up!

810
01:12:18,347 --> 01:12:21,111
I told you, you don't touch the money!

812
01:12:26,155 --> 01:12:30,091
- I had a special prayer you'd come visit,

813
01:12:30,192 --> 01:12:32,251
- Get up,
- Evenin', Hank,

814
01:12:32,328 --> 01:12:33,989
Evenin', Hank,

815
01:12:34,664 --> 01:12:37,758
- You took your time,
- I said get up!

816
01:12:39,035 --> 01:12:43,028
Get in line,
You fools fall for it every time,

817
01:12:44,774 --> 01:12:47,902
 God will judge you, you Judas,

818
01:12:47,977 --> 01:12:51,378
- Thanks,
- God will judge you!

819
01:12:51,447 --> 01:12:56,111
- Move out!
- Our lives are on your rotten soul,

820
01:12:56,218 --> 01:12:58,015
- Mister?
- Your rotten soul!

821
01:12:58,120 --> 01:13:00,088
Shut your mouth!

822
01:13:01,991 --> 01:13:04,824
- Pleasure doin' business with you, boys,
- Judas!

823
01:13:04,894 --> 01:13:06,657
Save your breath,

824
01:13:06,729 --> 01:13:09,391
You got a long walk back to the fightin',

825
01:13:14,837 --> 01:13:17,931
Ada Monroe and Ruby Thewes,
look at you both,

826
01:13:18,007 --> 01:13:19,406
look at us both what?

827
01:13:19,475 --> 01:13:22,103
like a couple of scarecrows
after a thunderstorm,

828
01:13:22,178 --> 01:13:26,342
we need a scarecrow,
Birds done ate up half our winter garden,

829
01:13:26,415 --> 01:13:30,351
For all your kindness, coffee... and a pie,

830
01:13:30,419 --> 01:13:36,051
Yeah, and that's real coffee, It ain't chicory
and dirt, Found a sack hid in the larder,

831
01:13:36,125 --> 01:13:37,092
Mmm,

832
01:13:37,193 --> 01:13:38,956
Thank you both,

833
01:13:39,028 --> 01:13:42,964
Ruby, I look forward to this,
we all do,

834
01:13:43,032 --> 01:13:44,693
Esco and me,

835
01:13:45,468 --> 01:13:48,562
- She made it,
- I made it,

836
01:13:50,172 --> 01:13:52,436
Good God in heaven,

837
01:13:52,508 --> 01:13:55,306
I'm still livin',

838
01:13:55,377 --> 01:13:59,746
well, I know Esco's
gonna be real sorry he missed you,

839
01:14:11,293 --> 01:14:12,624
Yep,

840
01:14:17,266 --> 01:14:20,201
- Strike you as odd?
- what?

841
01:14:20,269 --> 01:14:24,729
- Stood at her front door,
- I know,

842
01:14:24,807 --> 01:14:28,937
Number one, I knowed that woman
all my life, I never stood outside her house,

843
01:14:29,011 --> 01:14:32,208
She'd let a wolf in if it knocked at the door,

844
01:14:32,281 --> 01:14:34,044
Perhaps...

845
01:14:34,116 --> 01:14:36,448
I don't know,
Perhaps she was busy,

846
01:14:36,552 --> 01:14:42,388
Number two, old man Swanger's inside
that house, I could smell his pipe burnin',

847
01:14:42,458 --> 01:14:47,054
- Number three, look at them fields,
- what about them?

848
01:14:47,129 --> 01:14:51,293
we come by here a week ago
and they was waist-high in hay,

849
01:14:51,367 --> 01:14:55,599
You tellin' me
that's work for one old man and his dog?

850
01:15:03,412 --> 01:15:05,505
Yankees! Yankees!

851
01:15:05,581 --> 01:15:08,311
Cavalry! Federal raiders!

852
01:15:08,417 --> 01:15:10,385
Just over that hill,

853
01:15:10,486 --> 01:15:13,455
- Get those sacks of shit up that hill,
- Come on!

855
01:15:21,063 --> 01:15:25,762
Get those horses under cover,
If they see us, we're dead,

856
01:15:26,368 --> 01:15:29,269
Make a move, make a noise...

858
01:16:03,005 --> 01:16:05,303
I'm gettin' out of this,

859
01:16:05,374 --> 01:16:09,777
I'm not gettin' shot again
for some cause I don't believe in,

860
01:16:09,845 --> 01:16:11,676
Come on, let's go,

861
01:16:11,747 --> 01:16:13,647
Come on, They can't shoot,
Come on,

862
01:16:17,953 --> 01:16:19,818
Keep goin'! Come on!

863
01:16:19,889 --> 01:16:22,619
Bayonets,

864
01:16:23,425 --> 01:16:25,290
Come on!

867
01:16:55,124 --> 01:16:59,618
Grab their boots
and rifles! let's move on!

868
01:16:59,695 --> 01:17:01,663
let's go!

869
01:17:17,146 --> 01:17:20,809
That scarecrow
ain't gonna frighten off no Yankee,

870
01:17:20,883 --> 01:17:23,818
Or are you tryin'
to make a man for yourself?

871
01:17:23,886 --> 01:17:25,376
No,

872
01:17:27,256 --> 01:17:31,352
I come by... a few days,

873
01:17:31,427 --> 01:17:33,918
- I don't pass by,

874
01:17:33,996 --> 01:17:37,227
- lookin' out for you,
- I know,

875
01:17:38,968 --> 01:17:41,061
I see you,

876
01:17:42,371 --> 01:17:45,636
- And I don't like it,
- where's your little servant girl?

877
01:17:45,708 --> 01:17:49,576
Ruby, She tradin' off
more of your daddy's silver?

878
01:17:49,645 --> 01:17:52,136
- Stop it!
- Her nose is in the butter,

879
01:17:52,214 --> 01:17:54,876
Her nose is right in your butter!

880
01:18:04,693 --> 01:18:07,161
This farm's got my name on it!

881
01:18:07,229 --> 01:18:10,892
You listenin', woman?
You're gonna need more than a scarecrow!

884
01:19:39,221 --> 01:19:41,189
Sal,

885
01:19:51,834 --> 01:19:53,825
Afternoon,

886
01:19:55,871 --> 01:19:58,533
Don't spread out,
why are they spreadin' out?

887
01:19:59,441 --> 01:20:02,205
I never seen a man work a field
with a shotgun before,

888
01:20:02,277 --> 01:20:03,676
There's a war on,

889
01:20:03,745 --> 01:20:05,804
Get off my land,

890
01:20:06,715 --> 01:20:10,048
- Your boys come home?
- Ain't seen my boys in four years,

891
01:20:10,152 --> 01:20:12,950
They're out fightin' other boys,
not old men and women,

892
01:20:13,021 --> 01:20:15,854
So you won't mind if we look around?

893
01:20:15,924 --> 01:20:18,188
'Cause we think they're here,

894
01:20:18,260 --> 01:20:20,956
we think you've got 'em
hid up somewhere,

895
01:20:21,029 --> 01:20:25,227
what I gotta give you?
Chicken? lamb?

896
01:20:26,602 --> 01:20:28,297
Sure,

897
01:20:28,370 --> 01:20:31,567
The thing is, you've only got one barrel,

898
01:20:31,640 --> 01:20:35,406
And there's five of us,
That's not a fair fight,

899
01:20:39,281 --> 01:20:41,215
King of kings!

900
01:20:42,217 --> 01:20:42,911
Hey!

901
01:20:44,853 --> 01:20:45,820
what was that?

902
01:20:47,289 --> 01:20:49,780
Aargh!

903
01:20:49,892 --> 01:20:53,828
You're harboring deserters, I could
confiscate this farm and everything on it,

904
01:20:53,896 --> 01:20:57,093
Every plate, every sheep,
every little pellet of chickenshit,

905
01:20:57,166 --> 01:20:59,430
I could confiscate your old lady's asshole,

906
01:20:59,501 --> 01:21:01,128
So don't you offer me no bird,

910
01:21:23,892 --> 01:21:26,759
Come on, boys!

911
01:21:26,828 --> 01:21:28,693
Mama's callin'!

914
01:21:36,905 --> 01:21:37,963
Mama!

915
01:21:38,040 --> 01:21:40,838
No!

916
01:21:40,909 --> 01:21:43,469
Mama! Mama!

917
01:21:45,080 --> 01:21:47,071
No!

922
01:22:24,386 --> 01:22:27,253
Buggery and shit!

923
01:22:27,322 --> 01:22:33,318
If I'da known you were this heavy,
I'da left you in those chains,

926
01:22:51,780 --> 01:22:53,771
Sally!

927
01:22:54,383 --> 01:22:56,112
No!

928
01:22:56,885 --> 01:22:59,046
No!

930
01:23:00,589 --> 01:23:02,056
Oh, God, Sally?

931
01:23:02,124 --> 01:23:03,421
Ada!

932
01:23:04,926 --> 01:23:06,917
All right, all right!

934
01:23:09,598 --> 01:23:11,691
Darlin', what?

935
01:23:12,868 --> 01:23:15,735
She's sayin' Don't bother! Go!

937
01:23:20,075 --> 01:23:22,100
Get her neck!

938
01:23:22,177 --> 01:23:24,805
- Sally!
- Get her neck,

939
01:23:28,483 --> 01:23:32,010
This world won't stand long,

940
01:23:32,387 --> 01:23:35,322
God won't let it...

941
01:23:35,390 --> 01:23:38,325
stand this way long,

942
01:23:43,565 --> 01:23:49,629
- How long have I been sleepin'?
- Two days, three days, Not long enough,

943
01:23:49,705 --> 01:23:53,664
- I can't stop here,
- Sit down before you fall down,

944
01:23:53,742 --> 01:23:56,370
I'm a deserter,

945
01:23:56,445 --> 01:23:59,778
If they find me here,
things could be bad for you,

946
01:23:59,848 --> 01:24:02,373
what are they gonna do?
Cut short my young life?

948
01:24:11,259 --> 01:24:14,956
I've learned a person
can pretty much survive off of a goat,

949
01:24:15,030 --> 01:24:17,863
A goat gives you company,

950
01:24:17,933 --> 01:24:19,730
and milk,

951
01:24:19,801 --> 01:24:21,632
and cheese,

952
01:24:21,703 --> 01:24:24,433
and, when you need it,

953
01:24:24,506 --> 01:24:26,303
good meat,

954
01:24:29,211 --> 01:24:31,202
That's my beauty,

955
01:24:31,480 --> 01:24:33,744
There's my beauty,

956
01:24:34,316 --> 01:24:36,910
So you been fightin',

957
01:24:39,688 --> 01:24:42,555
I could be at killin'...

958
01:24:42,624 --> 01:24:44,455
for days,

959
01:24:45,427 --> 01:24:48,885
my feet against the feet of my enemy,

960
01:24:49,931 --> 01:24:52,263
And I always killed him,

961
01:24:55,971 --> 01:24:57,836
He never killed me,

962
01:24:57,906 --> 01:24:59,897
I don't know why,

963
01:25:01,276 --> 01:25:04,336
Gave it a try, to look at ya,

964
01:25:06,148 --> 01:25:08,139
Yeah, I guess he did,

965
01:25:08,216 --> 01:25:10,013
See, I think there's a plan,

966
01:25:10,118 --> 01:25:12,643
There's a design
for each and every one of us,

967
01:25:12,754 --> 01:25:14,381
You look at nature,

968
01:25:14,489 --> 01:25:19,153
Bird flies somewhere, picks up a seed,
shits the seed out, plant grows,

969
01:25:19,227 --> 01:25:23,254
Bird's got a job,
shit's got a job, seed's got a job,

970
01:25:26,101 --> 01:25:29,229
And you've got a job,

971
01:25:29,304 --> 01:25:31,636
You done good, goat,

972
01:25:32,774 --> 01:25:35,106
You were a real beauty,

974
01:25:47,322 --> 01:25:51,156
Sometimes I think I'm crazy
when I'm just hungry,

975
01:25:51,226 --> 01:25:55,925
Now drink this,
It eases the pain, and you'll sleep,

976
01:26:03,071 --> 01:26:07,064
Is she waitin' for ya,
this Ada Monroe?

977
01:26:07,142 --> 01:26:09,337
She was,

978
01:26:09,411 --> 01:26:12,209
I don't know,

979
01:26:12,280 --> 01:26:15,613
Or even if she knows me,

980
01:26:15,717 --> 01:26:18,447
lie down,

981
01:26:18,553 --> 01:26:20,612
I'm like the boy
who goes for wood in winter

982
01:26:20,722 --> 01:26:23,885
and comes back in spring with a whistle,

983
01:26:25,126 --> 01:26:29,460
like every fool sent off to fight
with a flag and a lie,

984
01:26:32,300 --> 01:26:36,964
That's the laudanum gettin' to ya,
That's good,

985
01:26:37,038 --> 01:26:39,029
Say somethin' more,

987
01:26:43,812 --> 01:26:45,803
She got me a book,

988
01:26:47,215 --> 01:26:49,206
Ada Monroe,

989
01:26:51,653 --> 01:26:53,814
A man by the name of Bartram,

990
01:26:55,924 --> 01:26:58,119
He wrote about his travels,

991
01:26:59,194 --> 01:27:01,685
Sometimes...

992
01:27:01,763 --> 01:27:04,755
just readin' the name of a place...

993
01:27:05,934 --> 01:27:07,925
near home...

994
01:27:12,173 --> 01:27:14,164
Sorell Cove,

995
01:27:15,911 --> 01:27:17,902
Bishop's Creek,

996
01:27:19,481 --> 01:27:22,939
Those places
belonged to people before us,

997
01:27:24,219 --> 01:27:26,244
To the Cherokee,

998
01:27:26,354 --> 01:27:30,347
what did he call Cold Mountain?

999
01:27:32,827 --> 01:27:38,459
How could a name...
not even a real name...

1000
01:27:40,535 --> 01:27:42,867
break your heart?

1001
01:27:47,008 --> 01:27:48,999
It's her,

1002
01:27:51,046 --> 01:27:54,709
She's the place I'm headin',

1003
01:27:56,651 --> 01:28:00,553
And I hardly know her,
I hardly know her!

1004
01:28:04,626 --> 01:28:08,187
And I just can't seem to get back to her,

1005
01:28:12,867 --> 01:28:17,566
To have traveled so far,
from east to west,

1006
01:28:17,639 --> 01:28:19,903
a thousand terrible miles.

1007
01:28:19,975 --> 01:28:21,966
I have to close my eyes,

1008
01:28:22,043 --> 01:28:24,978
My feet treadin' all God's surface -

1009
01:28:25,046 --> 01:28:29,380
his ocean, his swamps,
his slopes and ridges -

1010
01:28:29,484 --> 01:28:35,423
to find myself, at last,
a mark in the aching snow,

1011
01:28:35,523 --> 01:28:38,185
from whence I beheld
through a blue haze

1012
01:28:38,259 --> 01:28:42,286
a world of mountains
piled upon mountains,

1013
01:28:43,231 --> 01:28:45,222
 Ada!

1014
01:28:46,635 --> 01:28:48,626
Ada!

1015
01:28:53,108 --> 01:28:55,167
- It's a man!
- what is?

1016
01:28:55,243 --> 01:28:59,805
Raidin' our corncrib!
Got him in the trap! That's him yelpin'!

1017
01:29:01,516 --> 01:29:04,246
- Help!
- Here,

1018
01:29:04,352 --> 01:29:07,014
Help! Damn,

1019
01:29:07,956 --> 01:29:10,049
listen up!

1020
01:29:10,158 --> 01:29:11,785
You got... Aim!

1021
01:29:11,860 --> 01:29:14,226
You got a barrel trained on your rear end!

1022
01:29:14,295 --> 01:29:17,355
- Get me outta this dang thing!
- You got a weapon?

1023
01:29:17,432 --> 01:29:22,426
No, ma'am, I'm...
My fists are about to drop off,

1024
01:29:22,504 --> 01:29:25,268
Unbelievable,

1025
01:29:26,141 --> 01:29:29,110
- Stobrod Thewes!
- Ruby?

1026
01:29:30,311 --> 01:29:32,779
Agh! 

1027
01:29:34,582 --> 01:29:36,914
That's my daddy,

1028
01:29:38,219 --> 01:29:41,347
Just so's you know,
I can eat while she's doin' this,

1029
01:29:41,456 --> 01:29:44,254
Just so's you know,
you ain't eatin' inside,

1030
01:29:44,325 --> 01:29:49,285
Number one, they hang people round here
for takin' in deserters,

1031
01:29:49,364 --> 01:29:53,425
Number two,
even if they was givin' out prizes,

1032
01:29:53,501 --> 01:29:56,129
you'd still eat outside,

1033
01:29:56,204 --> 01:29:58,502
- You're scarred,
- I'm what?

1034
01:29:58,573 --> 01:30:01,406
Your heart, Scarred,
I did wrong to ya,

1035
01:30:01,476 --> 01:30:05,708
You'd be scarred, You'd be real scarred if
I hadn't wrapped them trap teeth in sackin',

1036
01:30:05,780 --> 01:30:09,409
- which was my idea,
- which was her idea,

1037
01:30:10,452 --> 01:30:13,615
- I hurt you,
- Good God,

1038
01:30:13,722 --> 01:30:16,919
I made up 50 tunes with you in mind,

1039
01:30:16,991 --> 01:30:20,188
Ruby this, Ruby that,
Ruby with the eyes that sparkle,

1040
01:30:20,261 --> 01:30:23,025
Hey! let's agree,

1041
01:30:23,098 --> 01:30:27,296
You beat me,
you abandoned me, you ignored me,

1042
01:30:27,368 --> 01:30:29,029
then you beat me some more,

1043
01:30:29,104 --> 01:30:33,598
And all of that is better'n
Ruby with the eyes that sparkle,

1044
01:30:33,675 --> 01:30:36,473
I'm changed, People change,

1045
01:30:36,544 --> 01:30:38,603
war changes people somethin' terrible,

1046
01:30:38,680 --> 01:30:41,478
Ruby's told you, I've no doubt,
I wasn't always the best,

1047
01:30:41,549 --> 01:30:43,676
You were an asshole!

1048
01:30:43,785 --> 01:30:45,844
I can't disagree with that,
I was,

1049
01:30:46,521 --> 01:30:50,321
- would you get him outta here?
- Music's changed me,

1050
01:30:50,391 --> 01:30:52,382
I'm full of music, Ruby,

1051
01:30:52,494 --> 01:30:54,553
I wish I'd brung my fiddle,

1052
01:30:54,629 --> 01:30:56,927
Hey, Ruby, I got a new fiddle,

1053
01:30:56,998 --> 01:31:02,459
Oh, it's a beautiful fiddle, It's full of tunes,
Ruby, I didn't know I had it in me,

1054
01:31:02,537 --> 01:31:05,768
- You're all set,
- I...

1055
01:31:13,481 --> 01:31:16,143
Bless you both,

1056
01:31:18,853 --> 01:31:20,821
All right, then,

1057
01:31:26,094 --> 01:31:28,289
Ain't you got a proper coat?

1058
01:31:29,297 --> 01:31:33,859
Aw, darlin', I'm fine, you know, And you just
say the word, I won't come back neither,

1059
01:31:33,935 --> 01:31:36,699
Don't wanna put you or your mistress here
in any bother,

1060
01:31:36,771 --> 01:31:39,535
I'm not Ruby's employer,

1061
01:31:39,607 --> 01:31:41,541
Oh, Beg pardon,

1062
01:31:41,609 --> 01:31:43,440
Nobody is,

1063
01:31:43,511 --> 01:31:45,502
Oh,

1064
01:31:53,721 --> 01:31:57,623
You know who really needs a coat, darlin'?
My partner, Fat boy name of Pangle,

1065
01:31:57,692 --> 01:32:00,388
we're hidin' up in a cave
with a singer from Georgia,

1066
01:32:00,461 --> 01:32:05,421
and Pangle, he feels the cold like
a thin man, but there ain't no coat'll fit him,

1067
01:32:09,671 --> 01:32:11,070
I love you, Ruby,

1068
01:32:13,775 --> 01:32:17,336
In case the sky falls on our head,

1069
01:32:17,412 --> 01:32:19,937
You always were a good girl,

1070
01:32:30,225 --> 01:32:35,424
Ooh! He's so full of manure, that man,

1071
01:32:35,496 --> 01:32:39,432
we could lay him in the dirt and...
grow another one just like him,

1072
01:32:40,468 --> 01:32:43,369
That's medicine, that's goat meat,

1073
01:32:44,672 --> 01:32:46,867
And you're sick of both,

1074
01:32:46,941 --> 01:32:50,377
I have a deal to thank you for,

1075
01:32:50,445 --> 01:32:53,175
That's just for show,

1077
01:34:03,251 --> 01:34:05,742
- Get on back where you came from!

1078
01:34:05,853 --> 01:34:08,378
- Thank you for my coat!
- Thanks for the food!

1079
01:34:08,489 --> 01:34:11,549
- Git!

1080
01:34:11,659 --> 01:34:15,720
- I love my coat!

1081
01:34:27,976 --> 01:34:32,743
My love for linton
is like the foliage in the woods.

1082
01:34:32,814 --> 01:34:38,252
Time will change it, I'm well aware,
as winter changes the trees.

1083
01:34:38,319 --> 01:34:43,621
My love for Heathcliff
resembles the eternal rocks beneath.

1084
01:34:44,492 --> 01:34:47,655
A source of little visible delight,

1085
01:34:47,729 --> 01:34:49,890
but necessary,

1086
01:34:51,199 --> 01:34:53,599
He's always...

1087
01:34:54,769 --> 01:34:56,760
always in my mind,

1088
01:34:56,838 --> 01:34:59,136
She ain't gonna marry linton, is she?

1089
01:34:59,207 --> 01:35:03,337
You can't say that about Heathcliff
and then marry linton,

1091
01:35:04,946 --> 01:35:07,881
we'll find out,

1092
01:35:10,451 --> 01:35:12,681
Tomorrow,

1093
01:35:12,787 --> 01:35:16,223
I'm not waitin' till tomorrow!

1094
01:35:16,891 --> 01:35:18,722
Ruby...

1095
01:35:18,793 --> 01:35:23,321
A source of... little visible delight,

1096
01:35:24,499 --> 01:35:27,263
but... necessary,

1097
01:35:30,872 --> 01:35:34,000
I like that,

1102
01:36:00,768 --> 01:36:04,761
I'm a Confederate soldier...
on furlough,

1103
01:36:04,839 --> 01:36:07,933
I need shelter... and food,

1104
01:36:18,719 --> 01:36:21,051
I've got a rifle!

1105
01:36:21,956 --> 01:36:23,924
Fair enough,

1106
01:36:25,193 --> 01:36:27,593
I have some beans and corn pone,

1107
01:36:27,662 --> 01:36:29,823
All I got,

1108
01:36:36,938 --> 01:36:39,236
- Thank you,
- I'm alone here,

1109
01:36:39,307 --> 01:36:41,969
as you can see, with my baby,

1110
01:36:42,043 --> 01:36:44,739
I need to believe you mean no harm,

1111
01:36:48,416 --> 01:36:49,906
No,

1112
01:36:50,418 --> 01:36:52,613
I don't want it,

1113
01:36:52,720 --> 01:36:56,520
If I had my way, they'd take metal
altogether out of this world,

1114
01:36:56,591 --> 01:36:59,082
Every blade, every gun,

1117
01:37:13,774 --> 01:37:15,833
It's all right,

1118
01:37:15,910 --> 01:37:18,811
You're burnin' up, little man,

1121
01:37:35,163 --> 01:37:37,154
Is your baby sick?

1122
01:37:40,234 --> 01:37:45,604
My man's dead, Took his wound
at Gettysburg and never saw his boy,

1123
01:37:45,673 --> 01:37:46,833
I'm sorry,

1124
01:37:46,908 --> 01:37:50,867
It's pretty much what you'll get
if you knock on any door of this war,

1125
01:37:50,945 --> 01:37:53,743
Man dead, woman left,

1127
01:37:58,219 --> 01:37:59,948
It's mean food, but it's hot,

1128
01:38:00,054 --> 01:38:03,820
There's been no huntin' on the road,
just cress and roots,

1129
01:38:03,891 --> 01:38:06,951
I need to try and feed this man,

1130
01:38:07,028 --> 01:38:10,794
- Shh, You gotta eat somethin', baby,

1132
01:38:24,312 --> 01:38:26,940
He won't feed,

1133
01:38:27,014 --> 01:38:30,415
I'm Inman, by the way,
That's my name,

1134
01:38:31,986 --> 01:38:34,079
I'm Sara,

1135
01:38:36,891 --> 01:38:38,415
My baby's Ethan,

1136
01:38:39,994 --> 01:38:41,586
Glad to know you both,

1138
01:38:54,475 --> 01:38:57,672
You look about his size,

1139
01:38:57,745 --> 01:39:00,908
He was another man straight up and down,

1140
01:39:00,982 --> 01:39:03,041
Thank you,

1141
01:39:29,877 --> 01:39:31,674
Everything fit?

1142
01:39:33,281 --> 01:39:35,511
These boots are good boots,

1143
01:39:42,590 --> 01:39:45,252
well, I'll say good night, then,

1144
01:39:46,927 --> 01:39:48,918
Good night,

1146
01:40:12,753 --> 01:40:17,281
Christmastime will soon be over

1147
01:40:17,391 --> 01:40:22,055
then we'll join the band

1148
01:40:22,129 --> 01:40:24,996
- She don't speak?
- Can't speak! I told you,

1149
01:40:25,066 --> 01:40:27,296
well, is she feeble, then?

1150
01:40:27,368 --> 01:40:29,700
No!

1151
01:40:29,770 --> 01:40:31,101
Never mind him,

1152
01:40:53,994 --> 01:40:55,985
will you come inside?

1154
01:41:19,053 --> 01:41:25,424
would you do somethin' for me?
Do you... think you could...

1155
01:41:25,493 --> 01:41:30,294
lie here next to me and not...
need to go further?

1157
01:42:41,669 --> 01:42:45,605
- I'll go, I'll go, shall I?
- No,

1158
01:42:45,673 --> 01:42:48,005
I don't want you to,

1159
01:42:53,848 --> 01:42:55,839
Thing is...

1160
01:42:58,786 --> 01:43:01,050
I love someone,

1162
01:43:06,527 --> 01:43:09,155
I love someone very much,

1164
01:43:27,448 --> 01:43:29,439
Try and sleep,

1166
01:44:41,622 --> 01:44:51,463
Over home

1167
01:44:54,034 --> 01:44:57,470
- Merry Christmas, Pangle,
- Night, ma'am,

1168
01:44:57,538 --> 01:44:59,972
Merry Christmas, Georgia,
Nice to meet you,

1169
01:45:00,040 --> 01:45:03,339
- Merry Christmas, Miss Ada,
- Merry Christmas,

1170
01:45:03,978 --> 01:45:06,208
- Merry Christmas, darlin',
- Don't sleep here,

1171
01:45:06,280 --> 01:45:09,408
- we won't,
- It's dangerous, Don't sleep here,

1172
01:45:09,483 --> 01:45:13,476
Oh, it's bitter,
They could stop one night,

1173
01:45:13,587 --> 01:45:16,351
They stop one night,
they're gonna wanna stop two,

1174
01:45:16,423 --> 01:45:18,721
I'll be all right,
This coat's warm,

1175
01:45:18,792 --> 01:45:21,158
what about next Sunday?
lt'll be New Year,

1176
01:45:21,228 --> 01:45:24,925
- Maybe,
- Gonna be a better one than 1864,

1177
01:45:24,999 --> 01:45:28,992
- This war's over in a month,
- That's what he said a month ago,

1178
01:45:29,069 --> 01:45:31,537
It started off bein' over in a month,

1179
01:45:31,605 --> 01:45:34,335
Night, Miss Sally,
Merry Christmas,

1180
01:45:34,408 --> 01:45:37,468
-  Night, Miss Ruby,
- Night,

1181
01:45:38,412 --> 01:45:39,674
- Night, ma'am,
- Night,

1182
01:45:39,747 --> 01:45:42,238
You're stayin' with us tonight, Sally,

1183
01:45:42,316 --> 01:45:45,308
- That's my Ruby,
- She's an original,

1184
01:45:47,988 --> 01:45:53,517
- what kind of name's Georgia?
- It's where he's from, It's not his name,

1185
01:45:53,594 --> 01:45:58,896
well, I know it's meant to be
the ugliest state under the heavens,

1186
01:45:58,966 --> 01:46:01,696
why do you care what his name is?

1187
01:46:02,603 --> 01:46:05,868
Hey, what do you call
that cluster of stars right there?

1188
01:46:05,939 --> 01:46:08,066
Right there,

1189
01:46:08,142 --> 01:46:10,838
Uh... There? That's Orion,

1190
01:46:10,911 --> 01:46:16,144
And that's Gemini,
and that is Orion's big dog,

1191
01:46:16,216 --> 01:46:18,207
Canis Major,

1192
01:46:18,318 --> 01:46:20,445
listen to her, Sal,

1193
01:46:20,554 --> 01:46:23,887
She's turned into a regular highland girl,

1194
01:46:23,957 --> 01:46:29,554
Nah, I could always name the stars, Ruby,
That was never my problem,

1195
01:46:32,966 --> 01:46:35,799
I love you, darlin',

1196
01:46:35,869 --> 01:46:39,134
in case that big old sky falls on our heads,

1197
01:46:39,206 --> 01:46:40,468
Aw...

1198
01:46:43,744 --> 01:46:47,373
And I love you too, Sally,
I do,

1199
01:46:50,317 --> 01:46:52,785
- Get up!

1200
01:46:52,853 --> 01:46:56,345
Get up! Get out of here, quick!
The Yankees are coming!

1201
01:46:56,457 --> 01:46:58,288
The Yankees, they're here,

1202
01:46:58,358 --> 01:47:02,294
If they find you here,
things'll go bad on all of us,

1203
01:47:02,362 --> 01:47:05,991
- I can try and fight 'em,
- No, My baby, Please, no, Just...

1204
01:47:06,066 --> 01:47:08,057
Please, just git!

1205
01:47:20,080 --> 01:47:23,811
we're Union army!
we're lookin' for food!

1206
01:47:23,917 --> 01:47:26,477

Come on, open up! we're hungry!

1207
01:47:26,587 --> 01:47:29,181
- I got nothin'! I got nothin'!
- we'll see about that,

1209
01:47:31,658 --> 01:47:35,492
- There's a baby inside, Get it,
- Please, he's sick, Don't hurt him, please,

1210
01:47:35,562 --> 01:47:37,530
Please, I got nothin'!

1212
01:47:40,267 --> 01:47:43,794
That's right, Take the chickens,
Take the chickens, They're all I got,

1213
01:47:47,841 --> 01:47:49,934
Says she's only got chickens,

1214
01:47:50,010 --> 01:47:53,571
- You lyin' Southern trash,

1215
01:47:54,248 --> 01:47:56,239
we're hungry,

1216
01:47:56,316 --> 01:47:57,806
we got all day,

1217
01:47:58,786 --> 01:48:01,653
See, those birds
won't get you through the winter,

1218
01:48:01,722 --> 01:48:03,485
Please cover up my boy,

1219
01:48:03,557 --> 01:48:06,287
Just tell us where the food is,
we'll pick him up,

1220
01:48:06,360 --> 01:48:08,851
- Please, my baby's sick,

1221
01:48:08,929 --> 01:48:11,022
Please, just cover him up,

1222
01:48:11,098 --> 01:48:14,625
Please, I'm beggin' you!

1223
01:48:14,701 --> 01:48:17,397
Please! Have mercy!

1224
01:48:19,540 --> 01:48:22,338
- I got a hog!

1225
01:48:22,409 --> 01:48:23,808
I got a hog!

1226
01:48:23,877 --> 01:48:27,438
- He's hid out behind the house!
- Take a look,

1227
01:48:28,649 --> 01:48:31,482
Please! 

1228
01:48:33,053 --> 01:48:35,715
Please, sir, Please,

1229
01:48:35,823 --> 01:48:37,814
He's just a baby!

1230
01:48:39,560 --> 01:48:42,028
- He's shaking!

1231
01:48:42,095 --> 01:48:44,825
Please, just cover him up,

1232
01:48:44,898 --> 01:48:49,335
what's wrong with you?
what's wrong with you?

1234
01:48:50,938 --> 01:48:53,930
I ain't got nothin' else, I swear,

1235
01:48:54,007 --> 01:48:56,942
- That ain't necessarily so,
- Yes,

1236
01:48:57,010 --> 01:48:59,774
Take me inside,
we'll do whatever you want,

1237
01:48:59,847 --> 01:49:04,511
Take my baby inside,
let's all go inside! Please!

1238
01:49:04,618 --> 01:49:07,519
Please! Please!

1239
01:49:07,588 --> 01:49:10,751
You take that hog!
I'm as good as dead!

1240
01:49:10,824 --> 01:49:13,918
Take that hog 'cause I'm as good as dead!

1241
01:49:14,094 --> 01:49:16,358
- Shut up!

1242
01:49:21,368 --> 01:49:23,734
No! Agh!

1245
01:49:30,110 --> 01:49:33,511
- You know, he's gettin' ready to take a fit,
- what do you care?

1248
01:49:48,028 --> 01:49:50,588
- Shh... Shh...

1249
01:49:50,664 --> 01:49:53,132
That's better, Shh, That's better,

1250
01:49:56,803 --> 01:49:59,636
Hey, come on,
leave some for the rest of us,

1252
01:50:10,417 --> 01:50:12,885
Move away from the baby!

1253
01:50:14,588 --> 01:50:16,715
Towards me!

1254
01:50:16,823 --> 01:50:20,281
Don't shoot,
we just wanted food,

1255
01:50:20,394 --> 01:50:22,726
Take off your boots,

1256
01:50:24,364 --> 01:50:27,731
Take off your pants,
Take off your shirt,

1258
01:50:35,108 --> 01:50:37,099
Don't shoot me, please,

1259
01:50:38,645 --> 01:50:41,978
we're starvin',
we haven't eaten in days,

1260
01:50:42,049 --> 01:50:46,748
- Come on,
- we're starving, we haven't eaten in days,

1261
01:50:46,853 --> 01:50:48,878
Come on!

1262
01:50:51,658 --> 01:50:54,252
Thanks, Thank you,

1263
01:50:54,328 --> 01:50:56,592
- Now you get runnin',
- I will,

1264
01:50:56,663 --> 01:50:58,961
- And keep runnin',
- Thank you,

1267
01:51:59,393 --> 01:52:03,989
- I love the snow,
- I hate the snow, I hate the cold,

1268
01:52:05,932 --> 01:52:08,924
- Come on!
- Fellas, what's the rush?

1269
01:52:09,002 --> 01:52:13,564
If Ruby finds out we've spent the night,
there'll be hell to pay,

1270
01:52:50,210 --> 01:52:53,373
 My love, where are you?

1271
01:52:54,281 --> 01:52:57,876
with no hope of reaching you,
I write to you,

1272
01:52:57,984 --> 01:52:59,952
as I always do,

1273
01:53:01,922 --> 01:53:04,254
as I have always done.

1275
01:53:24,711 --> 01:53:27,839
You reckon we could eat this?

1276
01:53:28,548 --> 01:53:30,175
Hey,

1277
01:53:30,250 --> 01:53:33,913
well, you know, you cook somethin'
long enough, you can eat anything,

1278
01:53:34,020 --> 01:53:37,251
It's froze,
How long it been there for?

1279
01:53:37,324 --> 01:53:40,225
- You hungry?
- Yeah,

1280
01:53:40,293 --> 01:53:42,386
Not very long,

1285
01:54:19,099 --> 01:54:20,999
Good evenin',

1286
01:54:21,067 --> 01:54:23,763
Hope we didn't disturb you,

1287
01:54:23,837 --> 01:54:28,069
D'you mind if I warm myself by your fire?

1288
01:54:28,808 --> 01:54:30,537
Name's Teague,

1289
01:54:30,610 --> 01:54:33,204
- Do I know you?
- Stobrod Thewes,

1290
01:54:33,280 --> 01:54:34,269


1291
01:54:34,414 --> 01:54:36,644
- That your wife?
- That's a he,

1292
01:54:36,716 --> 01:54:38,479
Is he your wife?

1293
01:54:38,585 --> 01:54:43,147
we're musicians,
He picks a banjo, I got a fiddle,

1294
01:54:43,256 --> 01:54:46,589
Your sweetheart's got
a nice piece of flesh on him,

1295
01:54:46,660 --> 01:54:50,118
- He looks pretty romantic by the fire,
- It's a picture of love,

1297
01:54:56,770 --> 01:54:59,102
You gonna play that fiddle?

1298
01:54:59,172 --> 01:55:00,605
Sure,

1299
01:55:00,874 --> 01:55:02,739
Sure,

1300
01:55:02,809 --> 01:55:04,800
Hey, wake up,

1301
01:55:06,479 --> 01:55:08,470
Evenin', missis,

1302
01:55:09,216 --> 01:55:11,946
- where's Georgia?
- where's Georgia?

1304
01:55:16,256 --> 01:55:19,748
- Captain Teague wants us to play now,
- love to,

1305
01:55:19,859 --> 01:55:23,625
we heard there were some deserters
up in these parts hidden out in a big cave,

1306
01:55:23,697 --> 01:55:26,632
- Not come to my ears,
- So you don't know where this big cave is?

1307
01:55:26,700 --> 01:55:28,634
- No, sir,
- You do, Stobs, He means...

1308
01:55:28,702 --> 01:55:30,226
No, right, No, no,

1309
01:55:30,303 --> 01:55:34,069
There is a cave right up near Bearpen
Branch, we played some music up there,

1310
01:55:34,140 --> 01:55:38,668
- Never occurred to me they were outliers,
- It ain't nowhere near Bearpen Branch,

1311
01:55:38,745 --> 01:55:40,576
He's always gettin' lost,

1312
01:55:40,647 --> 01:55:43,548
That cave - we live there,

1313
01:55:43,650 --> 01:55:48,053
I used to freeze up in that cave
till I got gived this new coat,

1314
01:55:48,121 --> 01:55:52,148
Ruby made me this coat,
I like my coat,

1315
01:55:52,259 --> 01:55:55,626
This part belonged to a reverend
and this part belonged to a horse,

1316
01:55:55,695 --> 01:56:00,359
Ruby said - what is it? - 
I should pray or neigh, dependin',

1317
01:56:00,433 --> 01:56:02,697
He don't...
he don't know what he's sayin',

1318
01:56:02,769 --> 01:56:06,603
He got a mind
no bigger than a pickled walnut,

1319
01:56:06,673 --> 01:56:09,642
- It's a good coat,

1320
01:56:54,554 --> 01:57:02,086
On a sour apple tree

1321
01:57:46,206 --> 01:57:48,071
Broke my young heart,

1323
01:57:52,612 --> 01:57:54,603
we gonna be here all night?

1324
01:57:57,150 --> 01:57:59,141
Stand over there,

1325
01:58:10,296 --> 01:58:13,925
Ruby, she don't know
one end of the war from the other,

1326
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:17,094
You don't have to worry yourself about her,
is what I'm sayin',

1327
01:58:17,170 --> 01:58:21,038
Or Ada, neither,
You know what I'm sayin'?

1328
01:58:21,107 --> 01:58:23,837
You too,
You stand over there,

1329
01:58:26,846 --> 01:58:29,246
we gonna get our tintype made?

1330
01:58:35,889 --> 01:58:37,720
Don't smile,

1331
01:58:37,791 --> 01:58:39,520
- what?
- Quit smilin',

1332
01:58:39,592 --> 01:58:41,890
He always smiles,
He don't mean nothin' by it,

1333
01:58:41,961 --> 01:58:44,623
I told him, there ain't nothin' in this world
worth a smile!

1334
01:58:44,697 --> 01:58:47,222
Put your hat over your face,

1335
01:58:54,007 --> 01:58:56,032
Cover your face with your hat,

1336
01:59:04,751 --> 01:59:06,685
-  Ruby!
- what?

1337
01:59:07,320 --> 01:59:08,947
- Ruby!
- what's wrong?

1338
01:59:09,055 --> 01:59:12,491
- Teague... The Home Guard...
- what?

1339
01:59:13,560 --> 01:59:15,653
They shot your daddy!

1340
01:59:15,728 --> 01:59:17,821
They shot your daddy, and Pangle too!

1341
01:59:23,870 --> 01:59:28,102
I told Georgia he can stop here,
I told him he can sleep in the barn,

1342
01:59:28,174 --> 01:59:32,042
He's got nothin' inside him,
He'll walk out of here and die in the snow,

1343
01:59:32,111 --> 01:59:35,342
He can milk the cows,
I was worried about that,

1344
01:59:37,684 --> 01:59:41,620
It's five hours' climb from here,
He drew a map,

1345
01:59:41,721 --> 01:59:43,689
I'm ready,

1346
01:59:44,591 --> 01:59:47,424
You know them fools
stayed the night in the mill?

1347
01:59:48,695 --> 01:59:52,791
That's Stobrod Thewes, Can't do
one good thing without addin' the bad,

1348
01:59:52,866 --> 01:59:57,360
left tracks in the snow all the way up
for the Home Guard to follow,

1349
01:59:57,437 --> 01:59:59,735
- Sign that says Shoot me,
- Ruby...

1350
02:00:03,076 --> 02:00:04,566
Ruby,

1351
02:00:06,779 --> 02:00:08,940
I'm sorry,

1352
02:00:10,950 --> 02:00:13,851
Every piece of this is man's bullshit,

1353
02:00:13,920 --> 02:00:16,548
They call this war a cloud over the land,

1354
02:00:16,656 --> 02:00:21,423
but they made the weather, and then they
stand in the rain and say Shit, it's rainin'!

1355
02:00:27,100 --> 02:00:32,333
If I cry one tear for my daddy,
I stole it off a crocodile,

1356
02:00:36,142 --> 02:00:37,200
All right, then,

1357
02:01:26,659 --> 02:01:28,650
All right, then,

1358
02:01:29,696 --> 02:01:32,688
Dear God,

1359
02:01:37,003 --> 02:01:38,994
Oh, dear God,

1360
02:01:45,445 --> 02:01:47,913
He ain't here,

1361
02:01:47,981 --> 02:01:51,974
Agh! Teague's probably took him,

1362
02:01:52,085 --> 02:01:55,919
They did that with the Swanger boys,
didn't they?

1363
02:01:55,989 --> 02:01:58,958
Strung 'em up, as a warnin',

1364
02:02:04,197 --> 02:02:06,461
They took his coat,

1365
02:02:06,532 --> 02:02:08,397
why would they take his coat?

1367
02:02:14,273 --> 02:02:16,741
Daddy? Daddy!

1368
02:02:17,176 --> 02:02:19,167
Daddy!

1369
02:02:25,151 --> 02:02:26,846
- Daddy?

1370
02:02:26,953 --> 02:02:29,353
He's still breathin'!

1371
02:02:29,422 --> 02:02:31,822
It's Ruby!

1372
02:02:31,891 --> 02:02:33,620
Don't you die on me again!

1373
02:02:40,166 --> 02:02:43,966
- we gotta get him home,
- He won't make it, He'll die first,

1374
02:02:44,037 --> 02:02:47,438
He's got hardly no blood left in him,

1375
02:02:50,209 --> 02:02:52,200
 There it is, I feel it,

1376
02:02:52,278 --> 02:02:53,302
- You got it?
- Yep,

1377
02:02:54,280 --> 02:02:58,808
 There's a place close.
Old Cherokee, it used to be.

1378
02:02:58,918 --> 02:03:01,148
It's got shelter, water.

1379
02:03:01,254 --> 02:03:03,916
I used to hide up there
when he'd get a temper goin'.

1380
02:03:04,023 --> 02:03:05,991
God!

1381
02:03:13,399 --> 02:03:17,392
- I'll go look for some food,
- Take the shotgun,

1382
02:03:43,362 --> 02:03:45,057
Goddamn,

1384
02:03:55,875 --> 02:03:57,866
Turn around!

1385
02:03:59,445 --> 02:04:02,005
Go back where you came from!

1386
02:04:03,616 --> 02:04:05,106
Go back!

1387
02:04:09,422 --> 02:04:11,481
Ada?

1388
02:04:12,125 --> 02:04:13,285
Ada Monroe?

1389
02:04:15,394 --> 02:04:18,192
Turn around or I'll shoot!

1390
02:04:46,759 --> 02:04:48,090
Inman?

1391
02:04:48,427 --> 02:04:50,418
Inman?

1392
02:05:03,476 --> 02:05:05,637
Inman,

1393
02:05:37,877 --> 02:05:39,970
You better come with me,

1394
02:05:52,625 --> 02:05:54,593
Ruby,

1395
02:05:55,494 --> 02:05:57,121
This is Inman,

1396
02:06:02,201 --> 02:06:04,635
Oh! Congratulations!

1397
02:06:04,704 --> 02:06:08,231
Oughta send you out with a shotgun
a lot more!

1398
02:06:09,976 --> 02:06:12,035
looks if he's about to topple over,

1399
02:06:13,279 --> 02:06:15,873
- I may need to,
- You shot or somethin'?

1400
02:06:17,884 --> 02:06:19,442
Not lately,

1401
02:06:30,830 --> 02:06:33,924
- He's asleep,
- I ain't surprised,

1402
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:38,437
- Your man looked tuckered out,
- I saw him,

1403
02:06:38,504 --> 02:06:42,770
In Sally Swanger's well,
A man like a black smudge in the snow,

1404
02:06:42,842 --> 02:06:46,278
- well, there you go,
- It wasn't the same, what I saw,

1405
02:06:46,345 --> 02:06:48,506
In the well it was as if he were falling,

1406
02:06:48,581 --> 02:06:52,108
- You probably just don't remember it right,
- I remember it exactly,

1407
02:06:52,218 --> 02:06:54,277
There were crows - black crows,

1408
02:06:54,387 --> 02:06:56,514
They were flyin' towards me,

1409
02:06:56,622 --> 02:06:59,921
Ruby, I thought I was seein' him fall,

1410
02:07:02,261 --> 02:07:05,321
Instead, I was seein' him come back to me,

1411
02:07:07,700 --> 02:07:11,158
I got big plans for that farm,

1412
02:07:15,174 --> 02:07:17,005
I know,

1413
02:07:17,977 --> 02:07:19,774
I know you have,

1414
02:07:19,845 --> 02:07:23,781
I got a vision in my mind
of how Black Cove oughta be,

1415
02:07:27,853 --> 02:07:30,253
I don't know, Ruby,

1416
02:07:30,323 --> 02:07:34,555
All this while
I've been packin' ice around my heart,

1417
02:07:37,196 --> 02:07:39,994
How do I make it melt?

1418
02:07:42,935 --> 02:07:44,402
 Hey!

1419
02:07:45,338 --> 02:07:47,772
You about done with my knife?

1420
02:07:48,441 --> 02:07:50,671
we got a bird to cook,

1421
02:07:51,177 --> 02:07:53,008
 Just about,

1422
02:07:55,815 --> 02:07:59,649
You're makin' a pig's ear of that job,

1423
02:08:01,120 --> 02:08:03,088
Give it to me,

1424
02:08:09,061 --> 02:08:11,689
Oh, I ain't gonna cut you,

1425
02:08:13,499 --> 02:08:17,731
Can't see that it'd make
a bit of difference if I did,

1426
02:08:28,481 --> 02:08:30,779
You got the right feelings for her?

1427
02:08:31,217 --> 02:08:34,118
Don't turn your head! Tsk,

1428
02:08:37,823 --> 02:08:39,222
I do,

1430
02:09:04,850 --> 02:09:07,944
I'm sorry,
I was tryin' to be quiet,

1431
02:09:13,959 --> 02:09:16,291
Did you get my letters?

1432
02:09:18,030 --> 02:09:20,021
I got three letters,

1433
02:09:21,033 --> 02:09:25,561
I carried them,
I carried them in the book you gave me,

1434
02:09:25,638 --> 02:09:27,299
The Bartram,

1435
02:09:28,407 --> 02:09:31,843
I probably sent 103,

1436
02:09:36,582 --> 02:09:39,244
Did you write to me?

1437
02:09:39,351 --> 02:09:41,148
whenever I could,

1438
02:09:41,253 --> 02:09:43,517
If you never got them, I can summarize,

1439
02:09:43,589 --> 02:09:46,422
- No, No, no,
- I pray you are well,

1440
02:09:46,492 --> 02:09:48,824
I pray I am in your thoughts,

1441
02:09:48,894 --> 02:09:54,161
You are all that keeps me
from slidin' into some dark place,

1442
02:09:54,233 --> 02:09:57,361
How did I keep you?

1443
02:09:57,436 --> 02:10:00,303
we barely knew each other,
It was a few moments,

1444
02:10:00,372 --> 02:10:02,237
A thousand moments,

1445
02:10:05,144 --> 02:10:08,773
They're like a bag...
of tiny diamonds,

1446
02:10:10,282 --> 02:10:14,150
Don't matter if they're real
or things I made up,

1447
02:10:16,088 --> 02:10:18,147
The shape of your neck,

1448
02:10:20,159 --> 02:10:22,150
That's real,

1449
02:10:22,761 --> 02:10:26,720
The way you felt under my hands
when I pulled you to me,

1450
02:10:38,043 --> 02:10:40,671
You were plowing a field,

1451
02:10:41,680 --> 02:10:44,308
You were carrying a tray,

1452
02:10:44,383 --> 02:10:47,113
- You wouldn't come in,
- No, I wouldn't go in,

1453
02:10:47,219 --> 02:10:52,122
So that's why I had to carry a tray,
So I could come out to see you,

1454
02:10:54,193 --> 02:10:57,287
That kiss,

1455
02:10:57,363 --> 02:11:00,924
which I kissed every day of my walking,

1456
02:11:02,668 --> 02:11:04,761
Every day I was waiting,

1457
02:11:05,571 --> 02:11:07,095
longing,

1458
02:11:07,173 --> 02:11:10,233
longing to see your face,

1459
02:11:16,415 --> 02:11:19,748
If you could see my inside...

1460
02:11:19,852 --> 02:11:24,789
Now, whatever you wanna name it -
my spirit? That's what I fear,

1461
02:11:25,891 --> 02:11:27,859
I think I'm ruined,

1462
02:11:27,927 --> 02:11:31,693
They kept tryin' to put me in the ground,

1463
02:11:32,698 --> 02:11:35,360
- But I wasn't ready,
- Inman...

1464
02:11:35,434 --> 02:11:38,835
But if I had... if I had goodness,
I lost it,

1465
02:11:41,106 --> 02:11:44,303
If I had anything tender in me,
I shot it dead,

1466
02:11:46,045 --> 02:11:49,845
How could I write to you after what I done,

1467
02:11:50,749 --> 02:11:51,909
what I seen?

1468
02:11:52,017 --> 02:11:53,484
 Number one,

1469
02:11:53,586 --> 02:11:55,918
shut this door,
It's freezin',

1470
02:11:55,988 --> 02:11:58,980
Number two, shut that door,
It's freezin',

1471
02:11:59,091 --> 02:12:01,491
layin' on my back,
my fingers poked in my ears,

1472
02:12:01,594 --> 02:12:04,427
tryin' to shut out
who's got a bag of diamonds,

1473
02:12:04,496 --> 02:12:06,691
who's carrying a tray...

1474
02:12:06,765 --> 02:12:09,063
If you wanna get three feet up a bull's ass,

1475
02:12:09,134 --> 02:12:12,729
just listen to what sweethearts
whisper to one another,

1476
02:12:12,805 --> 02:12:18,505
In fact, if y'all gonna wimble-wimble
all night, I'm gonna sleep in with him,

1477
02:12:33,225 --> 02:12:36,490
- I'll say good night,
- No,

1478
02:12:39,565 --> 02:12:41,556
Please...

1479
02:12:42,568 --> 02:12:44,331
don't say good night,

1480
02:13:08,961 --> 02:13:12,658
wars make some things pointless,

1481
02:13:15,868 --> 02:13:19,201
It's hard to imagine a wedding,

1482
02:13:20,739 --> 02:13:24,038
I think even my father
would recognize that,

1483
02:13:24,610 --> 02:13:27,044
Ada, I wanna marry you,

1484
02:13:28,347 --> 02:13:29,871
If you'll have me,

1485
02:13:31,483 --> 02:13:36,420
Isn't there some religion where you just
have to say I marry you three times,

1486
02:13:36,488 --> 02:13:38,456
and you're man and wife?

1487
02:13:39,391 --> 02:13:41,359
I marry you,

1488
02:13:42,661 --> 02:13:44,788
I marry you, I marry you,

1489
02:13:49,868 --> 02:13:51,893
why is that funny?

1490
02:13:51,970 --> 02:13:57,772
I think it's I divorce you three times
and you're not married anymore,

1491
02:13:58,610 --> 02:14:00,544
I can wait for you,

1492
02:14:00,612 --> 02:14:06,073
Oh, Inman,
I marry you, I marry you, I marry you,

1493
02:14:06,185 --> 02:14:08,153
I marry you, I marry you,

1494
02:14:16,128 --> 02:14:19,825
I have so...
I have so many buttons, Sorry,

1495
02:14:23,469 --> 02:14:26,267
will you turn your back?

1496
02:14:37,483 --> 02:14:38,848
No,

1497
02:14:41,153 --> 02:14:42,620
No, I will not,

1500
02:16:28,594 --> 02:16:31,529
I'll lead the horse
at a pace your daddy can tolerate,

1501
02:16:31,597 --> 02:16:35,328
- You two go ahead now,
- No, I don't wanna do that,

1502
02:16:35,400 --> 02:16:38,096
- No, we can all go together,
- It's safer this way,

1503
02:16:38,170 --> 02:16:40,661
we're deserters,
No one has a quarrel with you,

1504
02:16:40,739 --> 02:16:42,730
He's right,

1505
02:16:42,808 --> 02:16:47,006
I gather I...
I need permission from you, Ruby,

1506
02:16:47,079 --> 02:16:50,207
if I reckon on livin' at Black Cove,

1507
02:16:59,591 --> 02:17:00,990
All right, then,

1509
02:17:04,930 --> 02:17:07,125
You stay on that horse,

1510
02:17:07,199 --> 02:17:10,134
And don't lose it,
Or sell it,

1511
02:17:11,003 --> 02:17:13,904
Gonna need it back on the farm,

1513
02:17:16,775 --> 02:17:18,766
All right, Daddy,

1514
02:17:22,948 --> 02:17:24,711
I don't wanna let you go,

1515
02:17:28,487 --> 02:17:31,684
I'll be with you by nightfall,

1516
02:17:36,528 --> 02:17:37,995
Ugh,

1517
02:17:39,798 --> 02:17:42,164
All right, then,

1518
02:18:12,798 --> 02:18:16,632
Hope that Georgia boy's
been tendin' to the animals,

1519
02:18:16,702 --> 02:18:19,637
- I knew you were thinkin' on him,
- I was not!

1520
02:18:19,705 --> 02:18:22,037
- I was thinkin' on swollen udders,
- Oh...!

1521
02:18:22,107 --> 02:18:26,339
- And before you say same difference...
- I'm sayin' nothin'!

1522
02:18:26,411 --> 02:18:30,905
Miss lovey-Dovey!
Miss lovey-Dovey!

1523
02:18:30,983 --> 02:18:33,008
Hey!

1524
02:18:33,118 --> 02:18:37,282
- That was a long funeral for your daddy,
- That was a wake,

1525
02:18:37,389 --> 02:18:38,947
That was Irish,

1526
02:18:40,926 --> 02:18:42,917
Now, your friend Georgia here...

1527
02:18:42,995 --> 02:18:46,692
we went down to visit you when
we heard you were harborin' deserters,

1528
02:18:46,765 --> 02:18:50,895
and he told us - after some persuasion -
you were up here,

1529
02:18:50,969 --> 02:18:53,836
we were up and down
this mountain,

1530
02:18:53,905 --> 02:18:55,236
Up and down,

1531
02:18:55,841 --> 02:18:57,672
There will be a reckoning,

1532
02:18:57,743 --> 02:19:00,678
when this war is over,
there will be a reckoning,

1533
02:19:02,347 --> 02:19:04,542
Did you make this coat?

1534
02:19:04,616 --> 02:19:06,607
Helpin' a deserter - that's treason,

1535
02:19:06,718 --> 02:19:11,212
Now, I know
it's half horse and half reverend,

1536
02:19:12,858 --> 02:19:14,826
A reckonin'?

1537
02:19:16,461 --> 02:19:19,589
The reckoning's for your world,

1538
02:19:19,998 --> 02:19:22,660
- It's not mine,

1539
02:19:26,471 --> 02:19:29,463
I'I be damned,
He's a hard bastard to kill,

1541
02:19:33,378 --> 02:19:35,744
-  No!
- Ruby!

1543
02:19:41,186 --> 02:19:42,710
 Inman!

1544
02:19:56,435 --> 02:19:58,266
- 
- Captain Teague!

1547
02:20:40,378 --> 02:20:44,405
- Come down from there!
- No, sir, Here is fine,

1548
02:20:44,483 --> 02:20:47,475
I'll just shoot the horse out from under you,

1549
02:20:47,552 --> 02:20:50,715
- You ridin' Captain Teague's animal?
- I am,

1550
02:20:50,822 --> 02:20:53,985
- He dead?
- I hope so,

1551
02:20:54,059 --> 02:20:58,428
look, give me your gun and ride on home,
I'm done fightin', I'm sick of it!

1552
02:20:58,497 --> 02:21:00,988
I give you my gun,
you're gonna shoot me dead,

1553
02:21:01,066 --> 02:21:02,226
I will not shoot you,

1554
02:21:02,300 --> 02:21:05,895
but nor am I goin' down this mountain
lookin' over my shoulder for you,

1555
02:21:05,971 --> 02:21:08,166
That's what they call a conundrum,

1556
02:21:12,577 --> 02:21:16,673
- I'll tell you what I got on my side,
- what you got on your side?

1557
02:21:23,522 --> 02:21:25,353
The confidence of youth,

1558
02:21:40,739 --> 02:21:42,900
Inman!

1559
02:21:59,891 --> 02:22:01,791

1562
02:22:34,226 --> 02:22:36,194
No!

1563
02:23:11,963 --> 02:23:13,191
I...

1564
02:23:14,065 --> 02:23:16,499
came... back,

1565
02:23:25,477 --> 02:23:27,843
I love you,

1567
02:24:00,979 --> 02:24:02,970
Baby,

1568
02:24:28,974 --> 02:24:32,432
what we have lost
will never be returned to us.

1569
02:24:33,979 --> 02:24:36,311
The land will not heal.

1570
02:24:37,148 --> 02:24:40,208
Too much blood.

1571
02:24:40,318 --> 02:24:43,879
The heart will not heal.

1572
02:24:43,989 --> 02:24:47,789
All we can do is make peace with the past

1573
02:24:47,859 --> 02:24:49,884
and try to learn from it.

1574
02:24:53,198 --> 02:24:57,760
- what are you doing?
- He died in the night, love,

1575
02:24:59,037 --> 02:25:00,971
Bring him here,

1576
02:25:01,039 --> 02:25:04,167
- Don't kill him,
- I'm not gonna kill him,

1577
02:25:04,242 --> 02:25:08,338
we have to try somethin'
or else he's gonna die too,

1578
02:25:08,413 --> 02:25:11,280
- It's all right,

1579
02:25:11,950 --> 02:25:14,441
we're gonna try a little trick,

1580
02:25:14,552 --> 02:25:17,020
- Shh,

1583
02:25:36,775 --> 02:25:41,940
There are days now
when I manage not to think of you.

1584
02:25:42,380 --> 02:25:47,374
when the needs of the farm
call with more urgency than my heart.

1585
02:25:48,820 --> 02:25:52,813
This time of year
there's so much life everywhere.

1586
02:25:54,826 --> 02:25:56,794
I find you in all of it.

1587
02:25:58,863 --> 02:26:01,855
As if you were still walking home to me.

1588
02:26:04,769 --> 02:26:09,001
If you could see us now
this Easter day at Black Cove,

1589
02:26:09,074 --> 02:26:12,566
you would know
every step of your journey was worth it.

1590
02:26:29,928 --> 02:26:33,364
Grace Inman, nobody said Eat,

1592
02:26:46,144 --> 02:26:50,877
For good friends, good food, good family,

1593
02:26:50,949 --> 02:26:54,077
all our blessings, O lord, we thank thee,

1594
02:26:54,185 --> 02:26:55,550
- Amen,
- Amen,

1595
02:26:55,620 --> 02:26:57,247
- Amen,
- Amen,

1596
02:26:57,355 --> 02:26:59,880
-  Amen!

1597
02:26:59,991 --> 02:27:03,688
- Sweetheart, there's no cider,
-  That's for you,

1598
02:27:03,761 --> 02:27:07,993
Right, I'd best...
I'd best fetch it, I got my orders,

1599
02:27:11,102 --> 02:27:15,004
I looked once more down Sally's well,

1600
02:27:15,073 --> 02:27:19,134
and this time
there was nothin' there to haunt me.

1601
02:27:20,145 --> 02:27:22,079
Just clouds.

1602
02:27:22,147 --> 02:27:26,447
Clouds, and then... sun.

1603
02:31:10,174 --> 02:31:16,374
Just to lose him again?

1604
02:31:58,022 --> 02:32:03,858
Through musket fire

1605
02:32:33,691 --> 02:32:39,527
through death 's dark veil
