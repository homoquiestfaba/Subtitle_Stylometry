1
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:05,030
(ethereal music)

2
00:00:10,757 --> 00:00:12,190
- [Frances voiceover] Frances.

3
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:13,680
Frances Collins.

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:14,910
I've been married five years,

5
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:17,461
and that still sounds
like someone else's name.

6
00:00:17,461 --> 00:00:20,461
(upbeat rock music)

7
00:00:57,021 --> 00:00:59,521
(eerie music)

8
00:01:02,904 --> 00:01:03,737
- Hi.

9
00:01:10,019 --> 00:01:10,936
Hello, hey.

10
00:01:11,981 --> 00:01:13,043
How you doing?

11
00:01:13,043 --> 00:01:13,960
Good, yeah.

12
00:01:14,819 --> 00:01:16,569
Got a pile over here.

13
00:01:19,214 --> 00:01:21,714
(eerie music)

14
00:02:04,803 --> 00:02:07,886
(intense rock music)

15
00:02:31,533 --> 00:02:36,533
(door slamming)
(eerie music)

16
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,333
- [Frances Voiceover] I'm not scared

17
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,233
of being alone or lonely.

18
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:51,960
I'm afraid that by being so alone,

19
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,140
I'll forget how to behave,

20
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:56,970
which leads to really
embarrassing situations

21
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:59,650
that I don't want to
witness or experience.

22
00:03:00,702 --> 00:03:03,202
(eerie music)

23
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:05,913
I work at a collection agency.

24
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:10,373
We have mottoes like let
them hear your smile.

25
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:12,870
We aren't allowed to use our real names

26
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:14,020
when we make our calls.

27
00:03:15,571 --> 00:03:18,471
Most of the time, we get
answering machines and voicemail.

28
00:03:19,839 --> 00:03:23,410
It's strange to think of
all those messages of mine.

29
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:25,423
Floating around different names.

30
00:03:27,945 --> 00:03:30,445
(eerie music)

31
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,873
On my days off, I never go outside.

32
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:39,643
My husband calls me the agoraphobic freak.

33
00:03:45,524 --> 00:03:49,024
(steady electronic music)

34
00:03:54,476 --> 00:03:55,309
- Thanks.

35
00:03:57,015 --> 00:03:58,290
Good morning, Franny.
- Good morning.

36
00:03:58,290 --> 00:03:59,820
- Hi.
- Hi.

37
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:02,450
- I've got a new call,
daily calls summary sheet.

38
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:03,620
- Great.
- And why don't you

39
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:05,270
work on these accounts first?

40
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:07,430
These people haven't
been making their calls.

41
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:09,463
And then work on the batch.

42
00:04:10,658 --> 00:04:11,957
- [Frances] Okay.

43
00:04:11,957 --> 00:04:14,910
- [Frances Voiceover]
My boss is Snow White.

44
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:16,220
On acid.
- This gentles owes

45
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:18,613
about 15,000 dollars.

46
00:04:18,613 --> 00:04:19,560
- [Frances Voiceover ] She's one of those

47
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,180
guess my age type people

48
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:23,400
who succeed in middle management.

49
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,470
- Take these reports.

50
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:27,695
Some of them are delinquent of course.

51
00:04:27,695 --> 00:04:30,018
Some of have been paid off.

52
00:04:30,018 --> 00:04:31,277
You may want to loosen them out.

53
00:04:31,277 --> 00:04:33,816
- Alright.
- This is really important.

54
00:04:33,816 --> 00:04:34,818
- Absolutely.
- Thank you.

55
00:04:34,818 --> 00:04:36,098
- You just leave 'em.
- And when you're done,

56
00:04:36,098 --> 00:04:36,931
you can just let me know.

57
00:04:36,931 --> 00:04:38,600
- Alright, thank you.
- You're welcome.

58
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:42,139
(upbeat dance music)

59
00:04:42,139 --> 00:04:45,000
- [Frances Voiceover] This
job is a freak magnet.

60
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,650
It scares me because
out of all the people,

61
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:49,100
I've worked here the longest.

62
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:52,338
- Yes, is Mrs. Maloney there?

63
00:04:52,338 --> 00:04:53,688
This is Mrs. Jones calling.

64
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:57,774
- Hey, you look like you
could use a cup of coffee.

65
00:04:57,774 --> 00:04:59,840
- Oh, thanks.

66
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,910
- [Kate] I didn't know how you took it,

67
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:02,030
so I just brought it black.

68
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:03,300
I hope that's okay.

69
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,983
- Oh yeah yeah, I got my
own, my own stash right here.

70
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:08,283
- I'm Kate.

71
00:05:08,283 --> 00:05:09,780
I just started a couple of weeks ago.

72
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:10,613
- [Frances] Oh really?

73
00:05:10,613 --> 00:05:11,783
Frances.
- Frances.

74
00:05:13,298 --> 00:05:14,950
She calls you...
- Franny.

75
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:15,863
Yeah, I hate it.

76
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:21,360
So where'd you work before this?

77
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,820
- [Kate] Oh, I worked for
another telemarketing, yeah.

78
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,374
- Oh really?

79
00:05:25,374 --> 00:05:27,036
- [Kate] Yeah, it's kinda
different from collections, but...

80
00:05:27,036 --> 00:05:30,740
- [Frances] So how do
you like working here?

81
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:31,573
- It sucks.

82
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,010
Yeah, I'm just looking for something

83
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:36,994
better than where I am.

84
00:05:36,994 --> 00:05:41,994
Before I take off.
(laughing)

85
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,603
So are you going away on vacation?

86
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,393
- Oh.

87
00:05:47,575 --> 00:05:49,858
A little nosy there, aren't you?

88
00:05:49,858 --> 00:05:51,210
- [Kate] Well, it's not like

89
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:53,990
there's anything interesting
going on around here.

90
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:55,610
Awful day.

91
00:05:55,610 --> 00:06:00,610
- No, I'm just going to take a trip to up,

92
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:05,053
up, the coast.

93
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:08,330
- [Kate] It must be
nice this time of year.

94
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:10,717
- Yeah, yeah, it's sort of...

95
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,560
- Yeah, so how long are you going for?

96
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,000
- [Frances] Oh, just the weekend.

97
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,750
- Oh, well must be nice.

98
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,430
I wish I could go up there.

99
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:21,773
- [Woman] Thank you, thanks a lot.

100
00:06:24,122 --> 00:06:25,340
- Well I gotta be getting back to work.

101
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:27,420
Thanks for the coffee.
- [Kate] Yeah no problem.

102
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,740
- Thanks again.

103
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:29,964
- [Kate] I'll talk to you later?

104
00:06:29,964 --> 00:06:31,714
- Okay, great.
- Okay.

105
00:06:32,599 --> 00:06:35,940
(upbeat dance music)

106
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:37,100
- [Frances Voiceover]
Sometimes little things

107
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,273
make me want to die.

108
00:06:43,623 --> 00:06:44,743
- Franny.
- Yeah?

109
00:06:44,743 --> 00:06:46,970
- Could you tell me what this is about?

110
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:48,520
I don't understand this.
- What?

111
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,120
- It's telling them,

112
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,903
did they send in the
check for 197 dollars?

113
00:06:52,903 --> 00:06:54,220
And then it canceled.

114
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:55,163
What is this?

115
00:06:58,420 --> 00:06:59,520
- I'm not sure.

116
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,670
I think that that check bounced.

117
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:05,127
- Well you may want to call Mary Parker.

118
00:07:05,127 --> 00:07:06,590
I think it's important.

119
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:07,733
- Okay.
- Thank you.

120
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:13,143
- [Frances Voiceover] God,
she is completely psychotic.

121
00:07:13,143 --> 00:07:16,226
(upbeat dance music)

122
00:07:23,004 --> 00:07:26,004
(people chattering)

123
00:07:33,986 --> 00:07:35,650
I hate eating on my lunch break.

124
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:37,133
I just hate eating alone.

125
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,603
Besides, it's the only
free time I have all day.

126
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:46,250
Sometimes I pretend I
don't have to go back.

127
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,190
Boston is like this giant
closet full of clothes

128
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:04,150
you never would wear,

129
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,520
and can't imagine why
you ever bought them.

130
00:08:08,579 --> 00:08:11,746
(muffled jazzy music)

131
00:08:13,266 --> 00:08:16,970
The only thing I've learned
in this city is stillness.

132
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:18,873
How you can just not move or talk,

133
00:08:19,762 --> 00:08:22,262
and let everything and
everyone happen around you.

134
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:29,980
(muffled jazzy music)
(people chattering)

135
00:08:37,596 --> 00:08:40,679
(upbeat dance music)

136
00:08:52,997 --> 00:08:54,956
(dinging bell)

137
00:08:54,956 --> 00:08:56,990
- Okay everybody, it's six o'clock.

138
00:08:56,990 --> 00:08:58,470
Time to go home.

139
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:01,020
I'll see you all bright
and early tomorrow morning.

140
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:02,257
Thank you very much.

141
00:09:02,257 --> 00:09:05,236
You've all been a great solution.

142
00:09:05,236 --> 00:09:06,632
Why Franny, it's six o'clock.

143
00:09:06,632 --> 00:09:08,299
You can go home now.

144
00:09:08,299 --> 00:09:09,296
- [Frances] Oh yeah, I just want

145
00:09:09,296 --> 00:09:10,129
to finish up on these calls.

146
00:09:10,129 --> 00:09:11,720
- Oh, you're such a great worker.

147
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,590
Thank you very much.

148
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:13,500
Can I take these?

149
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,440
- Sure, those have all been done.

150
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,679
- Alright, thanks a lot.
- Okay bye bye.

151
00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:17,740
- Bye.

152
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:20,823
(upbeat dance music)

153
00:09:32,513 --> 00:09:35,393
- Goodnight Franny.
- Goodnight.

154
00:09:35,393 --> 00:09:38,476
(upbeat dance music)

155
00:10:10,459 --> 00:10:14,292
(energetic rockabilly music)

156
00:12:12,614 --> 00:12:15,614
(people chattering)

157
00:12:52,378 --> 00:12:55,045
(gate slamming)

158
00:12:56,142 --> 00:12:59,142
(mellow rock music)

159
00:13:03,877 --> 00:13:05,477
- Do you have a cigarette?

160
00:13:05,477 --> 00:13:08,378
- Sure, how did you know I was a smoker?

161
00:13:08,378 --> 00:13:09,795
- Just a feeling.

162
00:13:12,398 --> 00:13:13,552
Thanks.

163
00:13:13,552 --> 00:13:16,037
- Smoking's bad for you.

164
00:13:16,037 --> 00:13:16,870
- So what?

165
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:18,993
- So what.

166
00:13:24,042 --> 00:13:25,792
Can I get you a beer?

167
00:13:27,194 --> 00:13:28,444
- Sure, thanks.

168
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,513
I love beer.

169
00:13:32,513 --> 00:13:33,932
- Really?

170
00:13:33,932 --> 00:13:37,180
- I mean, I just started to drink.

171
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:38,530
- You just started tonight?

172
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:40,563
- Yeah.

173
00:13:41,917 --> 00:13:44,731
I never was much of a drinker.

174
00:13:44,731 --> 00:13:49,731
But, now I understand why
people do this, everyone.

175
00:13:49,777 --> 00:13:51,173
And cigarettes, too.

176
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:56,960
I just started smoking today,

177
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:59,710
and I think I'm already addicted.

178
00:14:00,821 --> 00:14:02,839
- Gee, today's been a big day for ya, huh?

179
00:14:02,839 --> 00:14:03,918
- It sure has.

180
00:14:03,918 --> 00:14:05,920
(laughing)

181
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,570
- I haven't seen you here before.

182
00:14:08,421 --> 00:14:10,042
- Oh yeah?

183
00:14:10,042 --> 00:14:11,718
Well today's my birthday.

184
00:14:11,718 --> 00:14:12,779
- Well, happy birthday.

185
00:14:12,779 --> 00:14:13,779
- Thank you.

186
00:14:17,338 --> 00:14:19,171
- So what's your name?

187
00:14:20,138 --> 00:14:20,971
- Um.

188
00:14:25,178 --> 00:14:26,233
Natasha.

189
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,061
- Natasha?

190
00:14:29,061 --> 00:14:30,556
- Yeah.

191
00:14:30,556 --> 00:14:31,389
- What is that?

192
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:33,930
- It's Russian.

193
00:14:34,971 --> 00:14:37,211
- Russian, that's different.

194
00:14:37,211 --> 00:14:38,214
- You think so?

195
00:14:38,214 --> 00:14:40,280
- Yeah, I don't think I ever
met a Russian person before.

196
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,070
- Oh well, I'm not really Russian.

197
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:44,833
Just my parents liked the name Natasha.

198
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,550
What's your name?
- That's a nice name.

199
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:49,670
Me?
- Yeah.

200
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:50,503
- Brian.

201
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:53,350
- Brian.

202
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:54,609
- So what's a pretty girl like you

203
00:14:54,609 --> 00:14:57,359
being alone on your birthday for?

204
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:02,971
- It's not like I have any more friends.

205
00:15:02,971 --> 00:15:04,587
- Me neither.

206
00:15:04,587 --> 00:15:05,590
- You neither?

207
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:09,174
- I don't like any (mumbles) either.

208
00:15:09,174 --> 00:15:11,172
- That's funny.

209
00:15:11,172 --> 00:15:12,622
- So what do you do, Natasha?

210
00:15:13,974 --> 00:15:15,303
Anything special?

211
00:15:17,206 --> 00:15:18,767
- Yeah, I am a...

212
00:15:23,507 --> 00:15:24,757
I'm a stripper.

213
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:26,674
- Really?

214
00:15:27,587 --> 00:15:28,627
- Yeah.

215
00:15:28,627 --> 00:15:32,044
Well it's not dancer, that's the PC term.

216
00:15:34,158 --> 00:15:37,081
But I don't do it to
support my kid or anything.

217
00:15:37,081 --> 00:15:38,078
- Oh you have a kid?

218
00:15:38,078 --> 00:15:38,911
- No.

219
00:15:40,236 --> 00:15:42,121
I just do it for the fun of it, you know?

220
00:15:42,121 --> 00:15:43,118
- Oh really?

221
00:15:43,118 --> 00:15:43,951
- Uh huh.

222
00:15:45,054 --> 00:15:46,339
- Well I love entertainment.

223
00:15:46,339 --> 00:15:47,172
- Do you?

224
00:15:47,172 --> 00:15:48,234
- Oh yeah.

225
00:15:48,234 --> 00:15:50,560
- Do you ever go to any of those clubs?

226
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,198
- Once in a great while I might pop in.

227
00:15:53,198 --> 00:15:54,031
Maybe I've seen you.

228
00:15:54,031 --> 00:15:55,299
Where do you strip?

229
00:15:55,299 --> 00:15:56,297
- Perhaps.
- Oh, where

230
00:15:56,297 --> 00:15:57,137
do you dance exotically?

231
00:15:57,137 --> 00:15:57,970
I'm sorry.

232
00:16:00,099 --> 00:16:02,370
- You know, downtown.

233
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:05,161
Maybe we should drink a little bit more.

234
00:16:05,161 --> 00:16:06,478
- [Brian] We can definitely
get a few more beers.

235
00:16:06,478 --> 00:16:07,598
- I think so.

236
00:16:07,598 --> 00:16:09,059
Maybe some shots.

237
00:16:09,059 --> 00:16:10,430
Don't people drink shots?

238
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:13,902
- [Brian] How about tequila?

239
00:16:13,902 --> 00:16:16,690
- Tequila.
- You can't beat tequila.

240
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:19,917
- Barkeep, tequila.

241
00:16:19,917 --> 00:16:21,417
- One, two, three.

242
00:16:27,161 --> 00:16:28,670
You didn't finish it all.

243
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:30,430
- I know I tried.

244
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:31,518
- Well you did a good job.

245
00:16:31,518 --> 00:16:35,598
- I couldn't do the rest,
I was gonna throw up.

246
00:16:35,598 --> 00:16:37,410
That was good, though.

247
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:39,890
I want to try something else.

248
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:40,723
- Really?

249
00:16:40,723 --> 00:16:41,556
- Yeah.

250
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:43,263
- Whiskey.

251
00:16:44,659 --> 00:16:46,360
Wait, we should toast.

252
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,560
What should we toast to?

253
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,060
- Okay to freedom.

254
00:16:50,744 --> 00:16:52,220
- To freedom.

255
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,323
- To no responsibility.

256
00:16:55,363 --> 00:16:56,365
To fun.

257
00:16:56,365 --> 00:16:57,360
- To fun.

258
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,183
- Is that easy enough?

259
00:16:59,183 --> 00:17:00,963
- To fun and to freedom.

260
00:17:00,963 --> 00:17:02,263
- To fun and wild freedom.

261
00:17:03,322 --> 00:17:04,739
- Drink.
- Drink.

262
00:17:06,003 --> 00:17:09,170
(eerie muffled music)

263
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:13,853
- Two sambuca.

264
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,717
Por favori.

265
00:17:17,843 --> 00:17:18,676
- Por favor.

266
00:17:18,676 --> 00:17:20,250
- Yeah I speak more than one language.

267
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:21,501
- Do you really?

268
00:17:21,501 --> 00:17:22,610
- Yeah.
- That's very sexy.

269
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:23,583
- [Brian] I think that's French.

270
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:24,540
- Por favor?

271
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:25,960
It sounds like Spanish.

272
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,513
- Yeah, same thing.

273
00:17:28,424 --> 00:17:29,421
Un.

274
00:17:29,421 --> 00:17:30,421
- Dos, tres.

275
00:17:36,643 --> 00:17:37,640
- How 'bout a beer?

276
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,610
Your beer doing okay?

277
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:39,790
- I got some left.

278
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:41,619
- Or you want to do another shot?

279
00:17:41,619 --> 00:17:43,139
- I need a breather.

280
00:17:43,139 --> 00:17:44,141
- Really?

281
00:17:44,141 --> 00:17:45,139
- Yeah.
- Okay.

282
00:17:45,139 --> 00:17:46,941
- I wish we could go dancing.

283
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:48,910
- Would you like to?

284
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:50,285
- Yeah.

285
00:17:50,285 --> 00:17:53,085
- We can dance right here, if you want.

286
00:17:53,085 --> 00:17:55,168
I'm not much of a dancer.

287
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,702
- That's it, I'm done.

288
00:18:01,702 --> 00:18:02,620
- Really, you are?

289
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:03,453
- Yeah.

290
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:08,040
Let's go sit down over there.

291
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:11,453
- That's good.

292
00:18:14,896 --> 00:18:17,979
You know they're going to be closing.

293
00:18:20,438 --> 00:18:21,521
We should go.

294
00:18:28,105 --> 00:18:29,355
- We should go?

295
00:18:31,606 --> 00:18:32,439
- Yes.

296
00:18:36,726 --> 00:18:39,504
- But I don't have anywhere to go.

297
00:18:39,504 --> 00:18:40,421
- My place.

298
00:18:44,902 --> 00:18:46,152
- I don't know.

299
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:51,820
I've never gone to a strange
man's apartment before.

300
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:56,736
- Now, am I a strange man?

301
00:18:56,736 --> 00:18:57,697
- Yes.

302
00:18:57,697 --> 00:18:58,610
- No.

303
00:18:58,610 --> 00:19:00,070
- You're a stranger.

304
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:03,996
No, I want to drink this first.

305
00:19:03,996 --> 00:19:06,829
I need to drink this before we go.

306
00:19:07,757 --> 00:19:10,634
If I'm gonna have the guts

307
00:19:10,634 --> 00:19:13,049
to go with you back to your place

308
00:19:13,049 --> 00:19:15,388
I need to drink it.

309
00:19:15,388 --> 00:19:16,991
- Well, maybe we'll accept it.

310
00:19:16,991 --> 00:19:19,241
(laughing)

311
00:19:27,605 --> 00:19:30,355
- I should go back to the office.

312
00:19:36,279 --> 00:19:38,260
That was mine.

313
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,927
- It's out, no more.

314
00:19:51,851 --> 00:19:54,101
(laughing)

315
00:19:54,975 --> 00:19:57,477
Are you, are you okay?

316
00:19:57,477 --> 00:19:59,727
(laughing)

317
00:20:06,218 --> 00:20:08,468
(mumbling)

318
00:20:12,954 --> 00:20:15,371
(rock music)

319
00:21:24,052 --> 00:21:27,135
(upbeat funky music)

320
00:22:25,008 --> 00:22:26,152
(bell dinging)

321
00:22:26,152 --> 00:22:28,632
- [Woman] Okay everybody,
it's six o'clock.

322
00:22:28,632 --> 00:22:29,799
Time to leave.

323
00:22:39,212 --> 00:22:42,462
(energetic rock music)

324
00:23:59,453 --> 00:24:02,703
(energetic rock music)

325
00:24:49,251 --> 00:24:52,501
(energetic rock music)

326
00:25:28,925 --> 00:25:32,175
(energetic rock music)

327
00:26:09,823 --> 00:26:12,656
(eerie squawking)

328
00:26:18,808 --> 00:26:21,610
- [Frances Voiceover] My
sister married this really rich

329
00:26:21,610 --> 00:26:24,930
old guy and told him she
didn't have any family

330
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:27,593
'cause she's embarrassed
by me and my parents.

331
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,263
She thinks she's Victorian.

332
00:26:31,373 --> 00:26:32,870
Very repressed and proper

333
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:35,603
but she's really just a bitch.

334
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:40,472
- What are you doing here?

335
00:26:40,472 --> 00:26:42,472
- I need to talk to you.

336
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:46,530
- About what?

337
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:47,947
- Just let me in.

338
00:26:58,671 --> 00:27:02,580
I wanted to ask you if I could stay here

339
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:03,820
for a couple of days.

340
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:06,377
- No way, no way.

341
00:27:06,377 --> 00:27:08,577
- You just can't pretend
that I don't exist.

342
00:27:09,589 --> 00:27:14,089
- I have for a number of
years now and it's been okay.

343
00:27:15,456 --> 00:27:17,013
- I slept on the street last night.

344
00:27:17,013 --> 00:27:19,376
I have nowhere to go.

345
00:27:19,376 --> 00:27:20,209
Please.

346
00:27:21,193 --> 00:27:22,026
Please.

347
00:27:23,514 --> 00:27:27,181
(ethereal electronic music)

348
00:27:45,146 --> 00:27:46,690
- [Frances Voiceover]
She's got so much stuff

349
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,413
and it's not like I'm
gonna be in her will.

350
00:27:52,431 --> 00:27:56,181
(energetic electronic music)

351
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:42,860
I've never stolen anything before.

352
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:45,010
My sister used to, though

353
00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:46,673
but she got caught and stopped.

354
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:50,790
She used to be really brazen about it.

355
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:54,780
Like take a jewelry display
right out of the store.

356
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:58,088
Totally crazy how could she
get away with it, type stuff.

357
00:28:58,088 --> 00:29:01,838
(energetic electronic music)

358
00:29:18,507 --> 00:29:20,913
Thanks for everything, sis.

359
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,790
I wish I could be there to see you explain

360
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:25,743
all the missing things to your husband.

361
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,563
This calls for a celebration.

362
00:29:35,947 --> 00:29:39,197
(energetic rock music)

363
00:30:55,123 --> 00:30:58,150
- Who put the empty beer
bottle in the fridge?

364
00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:08,738
(clearing throat)

365
00:31:26,272 --> 00:31:29,939
(mystical electronic music)

366
00:31:38,392 --> 00:31:41,559
(playing guitar riff)

367
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:01,447
(music stops)

368
00:32:01,447 --> 00:32:03,030
What are you doing?

369
00:32:22,412 --> 00:32:26,995
(mumbling) some fucking strange chick.

370
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:30,690
Well, I don't see the band here.

371
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:32,930
I see you, me, and some
fucking strange chick

372
00:32:32,930 --> 00:32:34,630
I've never seen before in my life.

373
00:32:35,683 --> 00:32:36,553
This is bullshit!

374
00:32:37,527 --> 00:32:38,360
- Relax.

375
00:32:39,292 --> 00:32:43,057
- Bill, she is not hanging
out with us all day.

376
00:32:47,671 --> 00:32:49,330
- Breakfast with her?

377
00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:51,210
- I'm starving.

378
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:52,110
Now she's back.

379
00:33:02,657 --> 00:33:05,856
I've been up for like two hours, guys.

380
00:33:05,856 --> 00:33:09,439
(rock music in background)

381
00:33:10,791 --> 00:33:12,954
- I know it must be weird for you

382
00:33:12,954 --> 00:33:14,907
to wake up and see some
strange girl in your apartment

383
00:33:14,907 --> 00:33:19,907
but uh, just slept here,
you know, just passed out.

384
00:33:21,269 --> 00:33:23,391
- You were passed out.

385
00:33:23,391 --> 00:33:24,810
(laughing)

386
00:33:24,810 --> 00:33:26,928
I just put you down on the couch.

387
00:33:26,928 --> 00:33:27,926
- Yeah--

388
00:33:27,926 --> 00:33:30,730
- I don't, I don't even remember
getting home last night.

389
00:33:30,730 --> 00:33:32,112
I was fucked up.

390
00:33:32,112 --> 00:33:33,349
- Yeah, me too.

391
00:33:33,349 --> 00:33:35,599
(laughing)

392
00:33:36,928 --> 00:33:38,678
Your hairs so pretty.

393
00:33:40,166 --> 00:33:41,189
- Thanks.

394
00:33:41,189 --> 00:33:42,430
- [Bill] Was it a typical night for you?

395
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:45,003
- Well lately but not really.

396
00:33:46,474 --> 00:33:48,736
- Aren't you showing a little
bit too much thigh there?

397
00:33:48,736 --> 00:33:51,056
You cold or something?

398
00:33:51,056 --> 00:33:51,889
- [Frances] No, I don't
know where the rest

399
00:33:51,889 --> 00:33:53,452
of my clothes are.

400
00:33:53,452 --> 00:33:54,852
- I don't think you had any.

401
00:33:56,053 --> 00:33:58,066
- [Frances] I have a coat.

402
00:33:58,066 --> 00:33:59,516
- Maybe you should put it on.

403
00:34:01,325 --> 00:34:02,728
Your, what's your name?

404
00:34:02,728 --> 00:34:03,728
- Uh, Kasey.

405
00:34:04,669 --> 00:34:06,205
Kasey.

406
00:34:06,205 --> 00:34:07,626
- Like and the Sunshine Band?

407
00:34:07,626 --> 00:34:08,459
- Yeah.

408
00:34:09,890 --> 00:34:11,347
- Did I put it on okay?

409
00:34:11,347 --> 00:34:13,933
- [Frances] Oh yeah, it looks really good.

410
00:34:13,933 --> 00:34:15,583
Do you know a lot of bands, then?

411
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:19,170
- Yeah, well a couple.

412
00:34:19,170 --> 00:34:20,923
One of my exes is from a band.

413
00:34:23,890 --> 00:34:26,223
The Stone Hoagies.
- Really?

414
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,823
- So they do them from home.

415
00:34:34,427 --> 00:34:36,125
- They suck.

416
00:34:36,125 --> 00:34:37,986
(laughing)

417
00:34:37,986 --> 00:34:40,146
- Oh 'cause you guys are awesome.

418
00:34:40,146 --> 00:34:43,485
(rock music in background)

419
00:34:43,485 --> 00:34:45,735
- [Frances] All right,
well I'm starving, so.

420
00:34:46,786 --> 00:34:47,784
- [Man] You're buying, so.

421
00:34:47,784 --> 00:34:50,349
- I'm not buying, Kasey's buying.

422
00:34:50,349 --> 00:34:53,384
- [Bill] I'm getting for breakfast...

423
00:34:53,384 --> 00:34:54,640
(laughing)

424
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:56,870
- Do you guys know a good place to go?

425
00:34:56,870 --> 00:34:58,410
- [Lisa] Yeah, there's
this real greasy spoon

426
00:34:58,410 --> 00:35:00,114
right down the street called Dominic's.

427
00:35:00,114 --> 00:35:01,255
- [Frances] Oh yeah, cool.

428
00:35:01,255 --> 00:35:04,838
(rock music in background)

429
00:35:30,017 --> 00:35:30,850
So.

430
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:39,620
(mumbling drowned out by rock music)

431
00:35:39,769 --> 00:35:41,769
No, I'm still fucked up.

432
00:35:42,787 --> 00:35:44,387
I don't know what happened.

433
00:35:44,387 --> 00:35:48,220
(speech drowned out by music)

434
00:35:54,434 --> 00:35:57,767
(ethereal guitar music)

435
00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:40,140
(ethereal rock music)

436
00:37:14,904 --> 00:37:18,154
(energetic rock music)

437
00:38:44,998 --> 00:38:46,481
- [Bill] Let's get out of here.

438
00:38:46,481 --> 00:38:47,898
- Okay, let's go.

439
00:38:57,899 --> 00:39:01,622
- [Frances Voiceover] The
sky was beautiful last night.

440
00:39:01,622 --> 00:39:03,770
Like someone had tripped

441
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:06,750
and spilled all the stars

442
00:39:09,107 --> 00:39:11,473
and just picked up a few and left.

443
00:39:15,477 --> 00:39:16,596
- We'll see who can come back

444
00:39:16,596 --> 00:39:19,430
with the most phone
numbers from the most guys.

445
00:39:19,430 --> 00:39:21,520
- Wait, why am I getting
their phone numbers?

446
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,090
- 'Cause we're like in a competition.

447
00:39:23,090 --> 00:39:25,150
So we gotta, like whoever comes back

448
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:28,481
with the most phone numbers
wins the competition.

449
00:39:28,481 --> 00:39:29,598
How am I looking?

450
00:39:29,598 --> 00:39:31,450
- You look good.

451
00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:32,318
- You think so?

452
00:39:32,318 --> 00:39:34,224
- You look fabulous.

453
00:39:34,224 --> 00:39:35,057
- Perfect.

454
00:39:36,577 --> 00:39:38,043
- All right.
- Okay.

455
00:39:38,043 --> 00:39:39,126
- Here we go.

456
00:39:42,102 --> 00:39:45,019
(tense rock music)

457
00:40:28,363 --> 00:40:31,280
(tense rock music)

458
00:41:02,177 --> 00:41:05,094
(tense rock music)

459
00:42:03,213 --> 00:42:05,713
(cat howling)

460
00:42:07,319 --> 00:42:08,486
- [Bill] Shit.

461
00:43:11,639 --> 00:43:14,639
(siren in distance)

462
00:43:31,142 --> 00:43:32,724
- What the fuck are you doing?

463
00:43:32,724 --> 00:43:34,880
What is going, what are
you doing in my bed?

464
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:35,924
- Fucking chill out.

465
00:43:35,924 --> 00:43:36,921
- What the fuck, Kasey?

466
00:43:36,921 --> 00:43:37,961
What are you doing here?

467
00:43:37,961 --> 00:43:39,044
- Lisa--

468
00:43:39,044 --> 00:43:40,964
- Who asked you?

469
00:43:40,964 --> 00:43:41,983
Come on!

470
00:43:41,983 --> 00:43:43,885
- I'm sorry.
- Just fucking relax.

471
00:43:43,885 --> 00:43:44,884
- What do you mean you're sorry?

472
00:43:44,884 --> 00:43:47,241
What the fuck are you doing?

473
00:43:47,241 --> 00:43:49,599
Did you guys sleep together last night?

474
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:50,761
Did you fuck her?

475
00:43:50,761 --> 00:43:51,778
Did you?

476
00:43:51,778 --> 00:43:52,783
Get the fuck out of here!

477
00:43:52,783 --> 00:43:55,220
How could you fuck my boyfriend?

478
00:43:55,220 --> 00:43:56,121
- [Bill] Get ahold of
yourself, just fucking relax.

479
00:43:56,121 --> 00:43:57,359
- I thought we were friends.

480
00:43:57,359 --> 00:43:58,830
- I'm sorry, Lisa.

481
00:43:58,830 --> 00:43:59,999
Nothing happened.
- What do you mean

482
00:43:59,999 --> 00:44:01,696
you're sorry, you fucking bitch?

483
00:44:01,696 --> 00:44:03,161
Oh my god, did you fuck her?

484
00:44:03,161 --> 00:44:04,159
- Just chill the fuck out.

485
00:44:04,159 --> 00:44:05,999
- [Lisa] What do you mean chill out?

486
00:44:05,999 --> 00:44:07,001
What the fuck happened here?

487
00:44:07,001 --> 00:44:07,999
- Fucking relax.

488
00:44:07,999 --> 00:44:09,195
You're fucking freaking out.

489
00:44:09,195 --> 00:44:10,201
- [Lisa] What the fuck?

490
00:44:10,201 --> 00:44:11,140
What are you doing
here, what are you doing

491
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:12,923
in my bed with no clothes on?

492
00:44:14,010 --> 00:44:14,843
- Nothing.

493
00:44:15,893 --> 00:44:18,121
- [Lisa] Get the fuck out of here!

494
00:44:18,121 --> 00:44:20,680
- Lisa, just fucking calm down, all right.

495
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:22,010
- Lisa, we're sorry.

496
00:44:22,010 --> 00:44:24,180
- [Lisa] Don't throw it at
me, you fucking asshole.

497
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:25,183
- Fucking relax.

498
00:44:25,183 --> 00:44:26,180
- You fucked her, didn't you?

499
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:27,881
Did you fuck her?

500
00:44:27,881 --> 00:44:29,604
Bastard, I hate you, man.

501
00:44:29,604 --> 00:44:31,203
Fuck you.

502
00:44:31,203 --> 00:44:32,484
Fuck you!

503
00:44:32,484 --> 00:44:34,234
- Chill the fuck out.

504
00:44:42,297 --> 00:44:43,130
Just fucking relax.

505
00:44:43,130 --> 00:44:44,990
Get a fucking ahold of yourself, will ya?

506
00:44:46,399 --> 00:44:47,403
- Don't tell me to relax.

507
00:44:49,893 --> 00:44:51,393
You're gonna fucking be sorry.

508
00:45:57,091 --> 00:46:01,091
(upbeat electronic dance music)

509
00:46:03,267 --> 00:46:04,100
- [Frances Voiceover]
I'm beginning to think

510
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:05,320
of this office as home.

511
00:46:07,331 --> 00:46:08,164
Scary.

512
00:46:10,649 --> 00:46:13,232
I can do this for a few months.

513
00:46:14,288 --> 00:46:15,121
Then what?

514
00:46:18,385 --> 00:46:20,635
(coughing)

515
00:47:30,499 --> 00:47:32,604
- What the hell is this?

516
00:47:32,604 --> 00:47:33,604
Sweet Jesus.

517
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:51,043
Are you okay?

518
00:47:51,043 --> 00:47:52,337
- Yeah.

519
00:47:52,337 --> 00:47:54,920
Do you know, um, how do I get out of here

520
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:58,093
and which way it is to the, um, subway?

521
00:47:59,150 --> 00:48:00,343
I need to get to work.

522
00:48:00,343 --> 00:48:02,263
I have to get to work.

523
00:48:03,980 --> 00:48:05,670
Do you have a light?

524
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:12,473
Thank you.
- Sure.

525
00:48:14,043 --> 00:48:16,243
- I don't really remember how I got here.

526
00:48:18,496 --> 00:48:20,396
I don't really know what happened, so.

527
00:48:26,507 --> 00:48:27,700
See, I...

528
00:48:30,233 --> 00:48:31,550
I can't go home because,

529
00:48:34,987 --> 00:48:36,654
it's not good there.

530
00:48:39,777 --> 00:48:42,153
I've been getting by on not going home.

531
00:48:48,430 --> 00:48:51,300
I don't know if I can anymore.

532
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:52,623
Do you live nearby here?

533
00:48:54,961 --> 00:48:56,183
Can we go there now?

534
00:48:57,540 --> 00:48:59,137
I like to get out at night, you know,

535
00:48:59,137 --> 00:49:03,220
because all day long you're
working in an office.

536
00:49:07,423 --> 00:49:09,230
It's very boring.

537
00:49:09,230 --> 00:49:11,798
- [Man] You don't, make
sure, a drinking problem

538
00:49:11,798 --> 00:49:13,377
or anything, do ya?

539
00:49:13,377 --> 00:49:15,127
- A drinking problem?

540
00:49:17,557 --> 00:49:19,750
A problem with drinking?

541
00:49:19,750 --> 00:49:21,693
No, no.

542
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,263
No problem with it.

543
00:49:26,969 --> 00:49:27,873
I just like to drink.

544
00:49:31,025 --> 00:49:33,192
- This door really sticks.

545
00:50:00,043 --> 00:50:03,284
(plates clattering)

546
00:50:03,284 --> 00:50:04,317
Which one would you like?

547
00:50:13,966 --> 00:50:16,164
- This ones fine.

548
00:50:16,164 --> 00:50:17,806
- Okay.

549
00:50:17,806 --> 00:50:19,600
Let me put these away.

550
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:26,723
I'm sorry, I'm just a
little bit excitable.

551
00:50:28,030 --> 00:50:29,973
I never have people over.

552
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:33,483
I'm just gonna take my pills.

553
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:40,720
It's, I suffer from severe anxiety

554
00:50:41,577 --> 00:50:44,743
and uh, and depression.

555
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:47,393
Um.

556
00:50:54,930 --> 00:50:56,450
Um.

557
00:50:56,450 --> 00:50:58,830
This one is um,

558
00:50:58,830 --> 00:51:01,133
it's kind of worn off, it's um.

559
00:51:02,390 --> 00:51:04,470
Klonopin, it's highly addictive.

560
00:51:04,470 --> 00:51:07,230
It's a benzodiazepine and what it does

561
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:11,660
is it's supposed to block your alphas

562
00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:16,360
and it kind of leave you sterile

563
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:20,937
and this one is Paxil and I can't remember

564
00:51:20,937 --> 00:51:25,800
what, uh, genre of medication.

565
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:30,333
It's sort of like the
sister of Prozac drug.

566
00:51:33,130 --> 00:51:34,560
I'm sorry, I'm being weird.

567
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:35,930
I offered you coffee.

568
00:51:35,930 --> 00:51:37,372
- Oh no, that's all right.

569
00:51:37,372 --> 00:51:38,720
That's fine.

570
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:39,553
- No.

571
00:51:39,553 --> 00:51:41,340
- Don't worry about it, really.

572
00:51:41,340 --> 00:51:42,373
- No um.

573
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:46,746
I'm just gonna make some coffee

574
00:51:46,746 --> 00:51:47,663
and um, um.

575
00:51:51,347 --> 00:51:53,428
That's what I'll do.

576
00:51:53,428 --> 00:51:55,261
I'll make some coffee.

577
00:52:21,049 --> 00:52:23,632
(man groaning)

578
00:52:24,473 --> 00:52:25,510
Coffees done.

579
00:52:25,510 --> 00:52:27,343
- Oh great, thank you.

580
00:52:38,303 --> 00:52:39,136
Sure.

581
00:52:40,642 --> 00:52:41,975
- Sugar.
- Yeah.

582
00:52:43,982 --> 00:52:44,815
- Great.

583
00:52:48,737 --> 00:52:51,320
Let me know if it's too strong.

584
00:52:55,578 --> 00:52:58,578
(plates clattering)

585
00:53:11,164 --> 00:53:14,727
You can call in sick if you want.

586
00:53:14,727 --> 00:53:15,820
- Is this phone okay?

587
00:53:15,820 --> 00:53:20,400
- [Man] Yeah, it's a Western
Electric 211 from 1925.

588
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:23,426
It's um, its a really,
it's a collector's piece.

589
00:53:23,426 --> 00:53:24,487
- Wow.

590
00:53:24,487 --> 00:53:26,023
- [Man] Could you not get any blood on it?

591
00:53:26,023 --> 00:53:27,763
- Oh.
- Thanks.

592
00:53:27,763 --> 00:53:28,596
- Sorry.

593
00:53:37,922 --> 00:53:39,908
(laughing)

594
00:53:39,908 --> 00:53:42,807
Hello, may I speak to Rita, please?

595
00:53:42,807 --> 00:53:44,360
(upbeat dance music)

596
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:46,393
- Good morning, Rita Jenkins speaking.

597
00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:49,740
- Hi, Rita, it's Frances.

598
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:51,070
- Oh hi, Franny.

599
00:53:51,070 --> 00:53:52,770
It's 9:30, where are you?

600
00:53:52,770 --> 00:53:54,170
- Yeah, I'm calling in sick.

601
00:53:55,671 --> 00:53:57,490
- But you don't sound sick.

602
00:53:59,120 --> 00:53:59,967
- No, um.

603
00:54:00,980 --> 00:54:02,563
I'm not feeling well today.

604
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:05,420
Yeah, I'm feeling really really sick.

605
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:08,213
- I see.

606
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:10,933
Oh okay.

607
00:54:10,933 --> 00:54:13,390
All right, well then I'll
see you tomorrow morning.

608
00:54:14,294 --> 00:54:15,127
- Okay.

609
00:54:16,533 --> 00:54:18,390
All right, thanks.

610
00:54:18,390 --> 00:54:19,223
Bye.

611
00:54:23,111 --> 00:54:26,514
I think she knows I'm not really sick.

612
00:54:26,514 --> 00:54:27,347
- [Man] Sorry.

613
00:54:27,347 --> 00:54:30,430
(upbeat dance music)

614
00:54:34,507 --> 00:54:35,340
- Yeah.

615
00:54:39,429 --> 00:54:41,649
I think, do you mind if I take a shower?

616
00:54:41,649 --> 00:54:42,665
- No.

617
00:54:42,665 --> 00:54:45,108
The bathrooms right here.

618
00:54:45,108 --> 00:54:45,941
- Thanks.

619
00:54:47,082 --> 00:54:50,165
(upbeat dance music)

620
00:54:54,806 --> 00:54:57,473
(water running)

621
00:55:26,881 --> 00:55:29,964
(upbeat dance music)

622
00:56:44,895 --> 00:56:47,978
(upbeat dance music)

623
00:57:58,256 --> 00:57:59,089
My bag.

624
00:58:00,425 --> 00:58:01,258
Oh shit.

625
00:58:03,066 --> 00:58:06,149
(upbeat dance music)

626
00:58:35,455 --> 00:58:38,872
(funky industrial music)

627
00:59:06,557 --> 00:59:08,057
- Is Frances here?

628
00:59:11,918 --> 00:59:14,418
She left that at my apartment.

629
00:59:15,773 --> 00:59:19,190
(funky industrial music)

630
01:01:00,526 --> 01:01:03,943
(funky industrial music)

631
01:02:16,619 --> 01:02:18,786
(gasping)

632
01:02:30,737 --> 01:02:33,320
- You don't mind if I sit here?

633
01:02:37,312 --> 01:02:39,645
I'm not bothering you, am I?

634
01:02:40,817 --> 01:02:44,751
I just had to talk to someone, you know.

635
01:02:44,751 --> 01:02:46,897
Just went through an emotional thing.

636
01:02:46,897 --> 01:02:49,380
My husband just died from cancer.

637
01:02:49,380 --> 01:02:51,793
I couldn't stay, I had to leave.

638
01:02:51,793 --> 01:02:52,753
- [Frances] I'm sorry.

639
01:02:54,031 --> 01:02:56,153
- I don't mean to bother
you, I'm really sorry.

640
01:02:56,153 --> 01:02:57,916
- Uh, no, no.

641
01:02:57,916 --> 01:03:00,396
- 'Cause you look like you'd
have your problems, too.

642
01:03:00,396 --> 01:03:02,612
Nothing could be worse than mine,

643
01:03:02,612 --> 01:03:04,513
someone that died.

644
01:03:04,513 --> 01:03:05,777
- Yeah.

645
01:03:05,777 --> 01:03:07,300
- Same thing for you, huh?

646
01:03:07,300 --> 01:03:08,423
- Oh, no, no.

647
01:03:10,689 --> 01:03:13,240
Nothing, I'm fine, really.

648
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:16,012
I'm sorry about that, your husband.

649
01:03:16,012 --> 01:03:17,346
- I know.

650
01:03:17,346 --> 01:03:19,989
At least he's not
suffering and he just died.

651
01:03:19,989 --> 01:03:20,987
- Geeze.

652
01:03:20,987 --> 01:03:21,990
- It's just hard.

653
01:03:21,990 --> 01:03:23,480
I don't want to go to my
mother's house right now

654
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:25,560
and my family, just can't cope with them.

655
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:27,840
I'd rather talk to you even
though I don't know 'ya.

656
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:30,607
I don't usually sit down and
talk to people I don't know

657
01:03:30,607 --> 01:03:32,566
'cause if you start talking to people

658
01:03:32,566 --> 01:03:33,703
they're gonna think you're
weird but you're not.

659
01:03:33,703 --> 01:03:36,270
They're gonna say, who's that weird lady

660
01:03:36,270 --> 01:03:38,450
with the (mumble) all she
does is walk around talking

661
01:03:38,450 --> 01:03:40,289
to people, but not really.

662
01:03:40,289 --> 01:03:42,289
This is the first time it's like,

663
01:03:42,289 --> 01:03:44,780
I can, like sigh a little.

664
01:03:44,780 --> 01:03:46,440
I'm spilling my guts out,

665
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:49,470
you know, what's wrong, you
know did something happen

666
01:03:49,470 --> 01:03:52,223
dramatic to you or no just lonely person?

667
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:55,665
- I'm just tired, that's all.

668
01:03:55,665 --> 01:03:57,930
- Well, you look like
you haven't really slept.

669
01:03:57,930 --> 01:04:01,837
- Yeah, I'm very tired.

670
01:04:01,837 --> 01:04:05,040
- I haven't slept that much
either, since my husband died.

671
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:08,166
I was over at the hospital
every night, every night.

672
01:04:08,166 --> 01:04:11,180
Hard, you know, seeing
him just thrown away,

673
01:04:11,180 --> 01:04:12,600
getting real skinny.

674
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:13,433
- Yeah.

675
01:04:17,692 --> 01:04:21,014
- I shouldn't have
bothered you, I'm sorry.

676
01:04:21,014 --> 01:04:22,874
- [Frances] No, it's okay, it's okay.

677
01:04:22,874 --> 01:04:23,877
You're not bothering me.

678
01:04:23,877 --> 01:04:24,710
- No?

679
01:04:24,710 --> 01:04:27,063
- Nah, I got nobody
else to talk to, anyway.

680
01:04:28,711 --> 01:04:30,237
- Do you have a husband?

681
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:34,429
- Uh yeah, but not really anymore, really.

682
01:04:34,429 --> 01:04:35,629
- No, what happened?

683
01:04:35,629 --> 01:04:37,450
Break up or he's with someone else?

684
01:04:37,450 --> 01:04:38,617
- No, I just left him.

685
01:05:03,648 --> 01:05:07,065
(tense industrial music)

686
01:05:55,036 --> 01:05:56,918
- [Woman] I did it again.

687
01:05:56,918 --> 01:05:57,934
- [Frances] It's okay.

688
01:05:57,934 --> 01:06:01,372
- You know what it is, I'm getting sloshy.

689
01:06:01,372 --> 01:06:03,210
I know, I've been drinking
for a couple of days

690
01:06:03,210 --> 01:06:05,570
so it's like, well once I stop drinking

691
01:06:05,570 --> 01:06:06,973
I'm gonna be sick as a dog.

692
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:13,990
You're not gonna, uh, take
any of my stuff, are you?

693
01:06:13,990 --> 01:06:15,393
'Cause every time someone comes

694
01:06:15,393 --> 01:06:17,070
they even steal an ashtray.

695
01:06:17,070 --> 01:06:18,300
Or they take home,

696
01:06:18,300 --> 01:06:20,793
as you notice the glass,
the glasses on this.

697
01:06:22,770 --> 01:06:25,977
They take all my nice
ashtrays and my glasses.

698
01:06:25,977 --> 01:06:26,980
But you seem okay.

699
01:06:26,980 --> 01:06:28,530
You won't take my stuff, right?

700
01:06:29,480 --> 01:06:30,963
You don't want my (mumbling).

701
01:06:33,033 --> 01:06:35,100
This was George's chair.

702
01:06:35,100 --> 01:06:37,153
I could never sit in it because it always,

703
01:06:37,153 --> 01:06:40,000
be sitting here watching his stupid TV

704
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:45,000
but now he's gone, I'm gonna
sit in this chair, you know?

705
01:06:45,372 --> 01:06:48,572
It's my chair now 'cause he's not here.

706
01:06:48,572 --> 01:06:51,989
(tense industrial music)

707
01:07:54,682 --> 01:07:57,220
Oh god, she must of left.

708
01:07:57,220 --> 01:07:58,053
Shit.

709
01:08:00,479 --> 01:08:02,397
Think she left anything?

710
01:08:02,397 --> 01:08:05,397
(tense dance music)

711
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:18,500
I didn't think she was gonna take it.

712
01:08:18,500 --> 01:08:20,618
She took the whole thing.

713
01:08:20,618 --> 01:08:21,701
Jesus Christ.

714
01:08:23,140 --> 01:08:26,378
She took my glasses and that little thing.

715
01:08:26,378 --> 01:08:28,018
I don't believe it.

716
01:08:28,018 --> 01:08:31,096
This is it, let the
chaos to my house begin.

717
01:08:31,096 --> 01:08:32,266
Shit.

718
01:08:32,266 --> 01:08:35,516
(eerie whistling hiss)

719
01:09:06,971 --> 01:09:10,638
(ethereal electronic music)

720
01:09:52,592 --> 01:09:55,509
(soft dance music)

721
01:10:07,239 --> 01:10:09,318
- [Man] Oh hold on.

722
01:10:09,318 --> 01:10:10,956
Clean it off for a sec.

723
01:10:10,956 --> 01:10:14,123
Just gonna, I'm gonna clean over here.

724
01:10:19,014 --> 01:10:19,916
All right, come on in.

725
01:10:19,916 --> 01:10:21,580
- [Frances] Thanks.

726
01:10:21,580 --> 01:10:22,413
- So.

727
01:10:24,356 --> 01:10:25,189
So.

728
01:10:28,737 --> 01:10:31,750
(mumbling)

729
01:10:31,750 --> 01:10:32,583
Well.

730
01:10:36,297 --> 01:10:37,590
- So, um.

731
01:10:37,590 --> 01:10:38,690
Do you have the money?

732
01:10:39,890 --> 01:10:40,723
- [Man] How much?

733
01:10:40,723 --> 01:10:41,556
I mean what's your, you know,

734
01:10:41,556 --> 01:10:42,433
what are your rates?

735
01:10:43,409 --> 01:10:46,926
Do you have a ballpark figure, you know?

736
01:10:46,926 --> 01:10:47,759
- Well.

737
01:10:50,332 --> 01:10:52,332
I don't know, like $300?

738
01:10:53,270 --> 01:10:55,612
- What's that entail,
what does that include?

739
01:10:55,612 --> 01:10:57,529
What do I get for $300?

740
01:10:59,623 --> 01:11:02,070
Yeah, what do I get?

741
01:11:02,070 --> 01:11:03,047
- Um, um.

742
01:11:05,487 --> 01:11:07,840
I think, just you know, sex?

743
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:09,140
- [Man] Just sex for $300?

744
01:11:10,230 --> 01:11:14,070
Anal, oral, bondage, games?

745
01:11:14,070 --> 01:11:15,653
I mean, do I get the whole bit?

746
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:19,570
- Okay, maybe just like $200.

747
01:11:19,570 --> 01:11:22,113
- So anal and the games?

748
01:11:22,113 --> 01:11:25,230
- No, no anal sex.
- No, all right well.

749
01:11:26,209 --> 01:11:27,042
- Maybe--

750
01:11:27,042 --> 01:11:28,180
- I thought, well.

751
01:11:28,180 --> 01:11:32,050
- Look, I just, I just want
to do something, just average.

752
01:11:32,050 --> 01:11:34,270
- Just average?

753
01:11:34,270 --> 01:11:36,449
Average, what's average for,

754
01:11:36,449 --> 01:11:38,770
I mean what do you mean by average?

755
01:11:38,770 --> 01:11:40,549
- Okay, just like $100.

756
01:11:40,549 --> 01:11:41,483
All right, $100.
- $100, okay.

757
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:43,433
So what does that mean?

758
01:11:43,433 --> 01:11:46,188
Like, what do I get for 100 bucks?

759
01:11:46,188 --> 01:11:47,708
- Well for 100 bucks--

760
01:11:47,708 --> 01:11:50,646
- I mean do you swallow, do you not?

761
01:11:50,646 --> 01:11:52,609
I mean.
- Swallow?

762
01:11:52,609 --> 01:11:53,442
- Yeah.

763
01:11:56,270 --> 01:12:01,270
- I just want to have
old fashioned plain sex.

764
01:12:02,020 --> 01:12:05,165
You know, on my back, you're on top,

765
01:12:05,165 --> 01:12:10,165
let's do it once, with a
condom, and then go to sleep.

766
01:12:10,250 --> 01:12:11,630
- Okay.
- Okay?

767
01:12:11,630 --> 01:12:12,830
That's what I want to do.

768
01:12:12,830 --> 01:12:14,500
- [Man] You shoot dope or anything, heroin

769
01:12:14,500 --> 01:12:15,981
or anything like that?

770
01:12:15,981 --> 01:12:16,814
You're a prostitute.

771
01:12:16,814 --> 01:12:18,541
I mean what I'm supposed
to, I just want to know.

772
01:12:18,541 --> 01:12:19,687
- I don't do anything like that.

773
01:12:19,687 --> 01:12:22,243
- Do you have a john, I mean, a pimp,

774
01:12:22,243 --> 01:12:23,700
anything like that?
- I have no pimp.

775
01:12:23,700 --> 01:12:26,100
- So you're just working on your own?

776
01:12:26,100 --> 01:12:29,380
I mean nobody's gonna crash in
my door in like five minutes

777
01:12:29,380 --> 01:12:30,840
demand more money?

778
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:33,283
I mean if I give you the
money now, that's it, right?

779
01:12:33,283 --> 01:12:37,090
No surprises later on, no angry boyfriends

780
01:12:37,090 --> 01:12:39,800
or anything like that coming in, right?

781
01:12:39,800 --> 01:12:41,740
I think this is a good deal, right?

782
01:12:41,740 --> 01:12:44,020
- [Frances] I promise there's no pimp.

783
01:12:44,020 --> 01:12:44,853
- Okay.

784
01:12:47,620 --> 01:12:50,623
So, what's your bottom rate and
you said $100 for the night.

785
01:12:50,623 --> 01:12:52,303
What about like half a night?

786
01:12:53,981 --> 01:12:55,181
- Well can I sleep here?

787
01:12:56,930 --> 01:12:57,763
- [Man] Yeah.

788
01:12:59,310 --> 01:13:02,040
- Just plain sex with a
condom and sleeping here.

789
01:13:02,040 --> 01:13:04,815
- [Man] Yeah but sex for half the night.

790
01:13:04,815 --> 01:13:06,763
- And me on lying down.
- But half the night.

791
01:13:06,763 --> 01:13:09,055
I mean you won't even get
on top for a little awhile?

792
01:13:09,055 --> 01:13:11,830
Okay, so it's sex for the
half night, all right?

793
01:13:11,830 --> 01:13:14,154
Then you can sleep here together.

794
01:13:14,154 --> 01:13:15,592
All right.
- That's a deal.

795
01:13:15,592 --> 01:13:17,046
- Okay.

796
01:13:17,046 --> 01:13:18,713
- How bout 50 bucks?

797
01:13:21,184 --> 01:13:22,620
- So, all right.

798
01:13:22,620 --> 01:13:26,326
What about just like 15
minutes of actual sex

799
01:13:26,326 --> 01:13:27,693
and then you can sleep here?

800
01:13:27,693 --> 01:13:29,300
- 15 minutes and sleeping here?

801
01:13:29,300 --> 01:13:30,822
- Yeah.
- Oh okay.

802
01:13:30,822 --> 01:13:33,730
That's good, that's good, that's good.

803
01:13:33,730 --> 01:13:36,267
Okay, less than 50, 35.

804
01:13:36,267 --> 01:13:38,007
- 35, so 35.
- 35, 15 minutes

805
01:13:38,007 --> 01:13:42,267
with a condom, me on the
bottom, and then sleeping.

806
01:13:42,267 --> 01:13:43,350
- Okay, here.

807
01:13:45,643 --> 01:13:47,263
- That's a good deal.

808
01:13:48,246 --> 01:13:49,083
- Yup.

809
01:13:51,142 --> 01:13:53,092
- [Frances] You only got 12 bucks here.

810
01:13:54,902 --> 01:13:56,742
- No.
- That's 12 dollars.

811
01:13:56,742 --> 01:13:58,388
- Shit.

812
01:13:58,388 --> 01:13:59,221
Damn it.

813
01:14:03,190 --> 01:14:04,113
Fuck!

814
01:14:14,447 --> 01:14:15,530
What about...

815
01:14:17,391 --> 01:14:19,711
What will you do for 10?

816
01:14:19,711 --> 01:14:20,628
- 10 bucks?

817
01:14:22,370 --> 01:14:23,470
- [Man] I got an idea.

818
01:14:24,569 --> 01:14:27,430
How much does just talking cost?

819
01:14:27,430 --> 01:14:30,207
- Just talking?
- Yeah.

820
01:14:30,207 --> 01:14:32,543
- Talking and a bottle of whiskey is free.

821
01:14:34,004 --> 01:14:35,810
If you let me sleep here.

822
01:14:36,780 --> 01:14:37,613
- Okay.

823
01:14:37,613 --> 01:14:39,450
- [Frances] Just as
much as you can for $12.

824
01:14:39,450 --> 01:14:41,950
- Okay, any, do you
drugs at all or anything?

825
01:14:41,950 --> 01:14:42,783
- Not really.

826
01:14:42,783 --> 01:14:44,080
I, I--
- I know people.

827
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:45,660
So, if you'd rather that.

828
01:14:45,660 --> 01:14:47,501
- No, whiskey.

829
01:14:47,501 --> 01:14:50,600
I've never really done this before.

830
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:51,760
I don't know if you could tell or not

831
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:54,010
but then you came up
to me and you asked me

832
01:14:54,010 --> 01:14:56,262
and I thought, well hey, well I might

833
01:14:56,262 --> 01:14:57,362
as well give it a try.

834
01:15:00,159 --> 01:15:01,156
- Sorry.

835
01:15:01,156 --> 01:15:03,073
I just hate this thing!

836
01:15:04,509 --> 01:15:06,140
Okay.

837
01:15:06,140 --> 01:15:08,751
Yeah I'm not really, I
don't do this either.

838
01:15:08,751 --> 01:15:09,680
- Really?

839
01:15:09,680 --> 01:15:11,108
You seem so experienced.

840
01:15:11,108 --> 01:15:11,941
- Really?

841
01:15:13,188 --> 01:15:15,360
There's just a lot of cop shows on TV,

842
01:15:15,360 --> 01:15:17,050
they always got johns.

843
01:15:17,050 --> 01:15:19,370
- Yeah, can I just rest

844
01:15:19,370 --> 01:15:20,367
until you get back?
- Yeah, sure.

845
01:15:20,367 --> 01:15:21,200
Yeah.

846
01:15:21,200 --> 01:15:22,230
So I'll be back in a couple,

847
01:15:22,230 --> 01:15:23,340
you're gonna stay, right?

848
01:15:23,340 --> 01:15:24,443
- Of course.
- Okay.

849
01:15:50,228 --> 01:15:51,561
- Are you ready?

850
01:15:52,788 --> 01:15:53,705
Here we go.
