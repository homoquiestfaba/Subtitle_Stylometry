1
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,364
Come quickly.
Careful.

2
00:00:53,015 --> 00:00:54,551
San Ms. Dena!

3
00:00:56,545 --> 00:00:58,235
San Ms. Dena?
- Yes.

4
00:00:58,273 --> 00:00:59,923
Please, help my son.

5
00:01:01,841 --> 00:01:04,182
He has in recent days
more voices.

6
00:01:04,797 --> 00:01:06,216
He thinks that something would do him harm.

7
00:01:06,791 --> 00:01:08,941
Tell her.
- I hear his voice.

8
00:01:10,361 --> 00:01:12,088
It is increasingly stronger.

9
00:01:12,588 --> 00:01:14,467
What did he say?
- Nothing.

10
00:01:14,773 --> 00:01:15,657
Tell me what he said!

11
00:01:17,691 --> 00:01:21,029
He has a silver chain from a
car stolen from gypsies.

12
00:01:21,682 --> 00:01:22,834
We have tried to chain
return.

13
00:01:23,217 --> 00:01:24,559
But they did not accept him.

14
00:01:24,559 --> 00:01:26,671
Where is he?
- Here.

15
00:01:34,921 --> 00:01:35,881
Bring him inside.

16
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:02,744
Holy Father, we ask you, is to
mercy on this sick boy.

17
00:02:27,074 --> 00:02:29,071
No ... my son!

18
00:02:29,109 --> 00:02:31,833
Calm, quiet, we come down.

19
00:02:36,477 --> 00:02:38,396
Watch out, away from there, fast!

20
00:02:53,247 --> 00:02:57,660
Help me!
Help me!

21
00:03:14,891 --> 00:03:18,382
We will meet again ...
Here!

22
00:03:18,536 --> 00:03:22,490
DRAG ME TO HELL

23
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:36,229
Repeat the following sentences, literally,
as they are pronounced.

24
00:05:36,575 --> 00:05:39,874
There is no error possible, as the
properly quoted.

25
00:05:40,143 --> 00:05:42,599
There is no error possible, as the
properly quoted.

26
00:05:43,253 --> 00:05:46,437
You get a good sound when the mouth is round.

27
00:05:46,861 --> 00:05:50,735
A good sound when the mouth is round.

28
00:05:51,541 --> 00:05:54,458
Round, round.

29
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:17,675
I think this is going to work.
I call this afternoon and let you know.

30
00:06:18,559 --> 00:06:20,669
Thank you very much.
- Sure.

31
00:06:21,321 --> 00:06:23,393
Thank you
- Have a nice day.

32
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:26,196
You also, a pleasant goodbye.

33
00:06:43,118 --> 00:06:44,807
Mr. Jack ...

34
00:06:45,883 --> 00:06:50,064
Have you already taken a decision on
who the new assistant manager?

35
00:06:50,179 --> 00:06:54,402
I'm still not, but the
date it between you and Stu.

36
00:06:54,517 --> 00:06:56,704
Stu, who new?
- I know he is new,

37
00:06:56,742 --> 00:06:59,390
but he is very enthusiastic and
because we love.

38
00:06:59,506 --> 00:07:03,880
Stu is someone who goes on and
dare to take tough decisions.

39
00:07:03,918 --> 00:07:06,566
I am also able to make difficult
decisions.

40
00:07:06,604 --> 00:07:09,790
I'll let you know, once I
have decided, right?

41
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:15,047
In the meantime, please me by not
qualified procedures leading, right?

42
00:07:15,738 --> 00:07:17,236
Well.

43
00:07:18,463 --> 00:07:21,227
And ... do you mind now
lunch break to take?

44
00:07:21,379 --> 00:07:23,568
No problem.
- And maybe on your way back,

45
00:07:23,606 --> 00:07:25,602
a turkey sandwich for me take.

46
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:29,822
A turkey sandwich, a good choice.
- That you can do for me, thanks.

47
00:07:30,705 --> 00:07:32,010
With sharp mustard.

48
00:07:33,122 --> 00:07:35,579
You must still sign.

49
00:07:35,656 --> 00:07:37,497
Beloney and Johnson.
- Oh yes, of course.

50
00:07:45,557 --> 00:07:49,009
Professor Well, congratulations, with which you
has been very interesting.

51
00:07:49,047 --> 00:07:49,969
Thank you.

52
00:07:51,966 --> 00:07:53,769
I thought you would have a beer lust.

53
00:07:54,192 --> 00:07:56,340
I am also a bit disappointing.

54
00:07:56,608 --> 00:08:00,177
Oh, this thing, it does not stop me.

55
00:08:00,946 --> 00:08:02,173
Christine, you do it but.

56
00:08:03,632 --> 00:08:07,622
I get a new one.
- I tell you that you are crazy.

57
00:08:08,927 --> 00:08:10,079
Piece.

58
00:08:12,612 --> 00:08:14,069
What's broken?

59
00:08:14,184 --> 00:08:19,135
You're smart and sexy and amazing.

60
00:08:19,174 --> 00:08:22,859
Oh, I almost forgot.
- I found this at the bank.

61
00:08:23,165 --> 00:08:24,355
What is this?

62
00:08:26,004 --> 00:08:31,070
My God, it is a standing Liberty 1929
and it is almost cool.

63
00:08:31,146 --> 00:08:33,603
Was this just at the bank?
- Yes, really.

64
00:08:33,987 --> 00:08:37,440
That is in my nurd 'like
coin collection.

65
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:40,665
Thanks honey, I think
him very much.

66
00:08:42,775 --> 00:08:44,425
Well then.
- Day, until later.

67
00:08:44,655 --> 00:08:46,728
Until later, okay?

68
00:08:48,531 --> 00:08:49,951
Roger Dalton.
- Hello, darling.

69
00:08:50,028 --> 00:08:52,062
Hi, Mom.
- What are you doing?

70
00:08:52,062 --> 00:08:55,670
Christine was just before lunch and
We have a few things through.

71
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:59,546
O, from the farm?
- Yes, I already have one years courting her.

72
00:08:59,737 --> 00:09:01,310
She was eating ... we were eating.

73
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:03,728
I know, she is very nice.
- Yes, that's it, I can not wait for you ...

74
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,186
You know your father and I ...
- I told her ...

75
00:09:05,224 --> 00:09:07,949
have certain expectations for you.
- I do not get ...

76
00:09:07,988 --> 00:09:11,059
Like that handsome girl
I played with tennis.

77
00:09:11,097 --> 00:09:13,206
You know she graduated cum laude at Yale.

78
00:09:13,476 --> 00:09:16,852
And she is now a successful lawyer.
- Yes, you told me.

79
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:19,923
That's the kind of girl, where I
would like to see them.

80
00:09:19,923 --> 00:09:21,228
Mom ...
- It's the kind of woman,

81
00:09:21,305 --> 00:09:25,909
you really could help, social and
hence your career.

82
00:09:25,947 --> 00:09:28,750
and there would now have to think.
- Mom, I ...

83
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:31,820
You can not play with little girls
of the farm.

84
00:09:31,858 --> 00:09:35,159
It is now time to find a true partner.

85
00:09:39,763 --> 00:09:41,606
Christine, you have my work,
confused.

86
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:46,519
I did not.
- Yes, I said I did not post.

87
00:09:48,091 --> 00:09:49,472
You did not say.

88
00:09:52,466 --> 00:09:54,499
It does not matter, it is okay.

89
00:10:09,697 --> 00:10:11,078
Mr. Jacks.
- What Winny?

90
00:10:11,501 --> 00:10:13,112
Do you drink?
- Yes, I love drink.

91
00:10:13,266 --> 00:10:15,606
What do I need this, Sunday,
I can not use.

92
00:10:15,606 --> 00:10:16,950
This cerises?
- Yes.

93
00:10:16,988 --> 00:10:18,292
These are great seats.

94
00:10:18,638 --> 00:10:20,365
Here you warm.

95
00:10:20,403 --> 00:10:23,589
Yes, hot.
- Are you sure it is good?

96
00:10:23,896 --> 00:10:25,392
Thank you then.

97
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,295
Can you help me?

98
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:37,212
Of course, what can I do for you?

99
00:10:37,327 --> 00:10:43,352
This paper, my house and all
my other possessions, personals.

100
00:10:43,352 --> 00:10:45,501
Please let them stop.

101
00:10:51,028 --> 00:10:52,985
Mrs. ...
- Ganush.

102
00:10:54,405 --> 00:10:59,047
Mrs. Ganush, the bank lets you know they your
property on the 325 Brandon Street,

103
00:10:59,086 --> 00:11:01,427
Today, confiscate.

104
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:04,344
But that is my house, all 30 years.

105
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:09,333
And I've always paid me to my eye
lost by that disease.

106
00:11:09,947 --> 00:11:13,938
I hope soon to have money, I have
just a little more time.

107
00:11:14,053 --> 00:11:17,353
I do not think my manager you
gives more credit.

108
00:11:18,619 --> 00:11:22,880
Please, do not you try?

109
00:11:26,985 --> 00:11:29,787
Well.
- God bless u.

110
00:11:31,016 --> 00:11:32,243
God bless u.

111
00:11:37,924 --> 00:11:41,570
I have an older woman, who for delay
of a mortgage term calls.

112
00:11:41,876 --> 00:11:45,139
She has a fixed income and at the moment
some medical problems.

113
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:47,401
Can we do something to help her?

114
00:11:54,654 --> 00:11:57,763
It seems, she has already
twice been postponed.

115
00:11:58,031 --> 00:12:01,755
In these cases we put
attachment of the collateral.

116
00:12:01,793 --> 00:12:03,980
And the bank earns a substantial amount
to costs.

117
00:12:04,018 --> 00:12:06,129
But then we put her out of her house.

118
00:12:06,474 --> 00:12:07,741
Yes, that's a difficult decision.

119
00:12:09,314 --> 00:12:10,811
You must decide.

120
00:12:34,988 --> 00:12:36,715
I rule it.

121
00:12:56,056 --> 00:13:01,543
Mrs Ganush ... sorry, mrs Ganush,
but a delay is not possible.

122
00:13:01,582 --> 00:13:03,425
What?
- I would like to help,

123
00:13:03,463 --> 00:13:06,802
but it is not ...
- No ... Please, it's my house.

124
00:13:06,802 --> 00:13:08,989
Where should I live?

125
00:13:09,565 --> 00:13:12,443
You gave your granddaughter as reference,
maybe you can stay with her.

126
00:13:12,482 --> 00:13:14,438
Since I do not want to burden her.

127
00:13:15,206 --> 00:13:17,739
And there are fine and residential care
facilities ...

128
00:13:17,777 --> 00:13:23,303
I want in my house.
I would never want to live in such homes.

129
00:13:24,569 --> 00:13:26,297
I really, really sorry.

130
00:13:49,974 --> 00:13:52,699
I am a proud woman and
difficulties have now.

131
00:13:53,044 --> 00:13:56,230
And ... I've never come to have questions.

132
00:13:58,034 --> 00:14:01,487
But now, I pray thee

133
00:14:01,603 --> 00:14:04,903
I will do everything for you.
- Mrs. Ganush, please scroll down.

134
00:14:04,942 --> 00:14:08,319
I pray you, on my mother's grave ...

135
00:14:08,549 --> 00:14:11,542
I pray you
- Please, let loose, let loose!

136
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:13,691
Security!
Stop!

137
00:14:15,456 --> 00:14:17,720
Here Billy, here it is.
- I'm coming.

138
00:14:26,202 --> 00:14:29,348
You ... you move me crazy ..

139
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:41,705
I pray for you and you put me crazy.

140
00:14:42,781 --> 00:14:44,851
I think you are nothing
to do, ma'am.

141
00:14:45,389 --> 00:14:46,427
Come along.

142
00:14:52,758 --> 00:14:54,024
Mrs Ganush ...

143
00:15:05,576 --> 00:15:07,686
Help me here.
Come on!

144
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:14,939
Something I had never seen.

145
00:15:15,937 --> 00:15:16,858
You okay?

146
00:15:19,313 --> 00:15:21,310
You did very well, you know?

147
00:15:31,671 --> 00:15:33,935
Good night, until tomorrow.

148
00:15:37,849 --> 00:15:40,842
I've just seen that McPherson loan.

149
00:15:40,881 --> 00:15:42,953
This is an impressive piece of work.

150
00:15:43,145 --> 00:15:43,951
Thank you.

151
00:15:44,028 --> 00:15:46,484
Would you like to take this home to
complete it,

152
00:15:46,522 --> 00:15:49,631
because I would like to regional
Deputy Director show tomorrow morning.

153
00:15:49,822 --> 00:15:51,435
Of course, I do like.
- Really?

154
00:15:51,473 --> 00:15:52,664
Thank you.

155
00:15:52,854 --> 00:15:58,495
Oh, and the position of assistant manager
concerned, are you on top.

156
00:17:48,481 --> 00:17:51,859
You've put me crazy.

157
00:17:53,432 --> 00:17:55,888
You get what you deserve.

158
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:50,440
I beat you, you witch!

159
00:21:03,623 --> 00:21:08,191
Now will you come to me have to beg.

160
00:21:46,566 --> 00:21:49,367
They send someone to talk to her,
she will not bother you.

161
00:21:49,445 --> 00:21:52,245
Then you do not need to think of her.
I call Mr. Jacks

162
00:21:52,515 --> 00:21:54,663
and ask him if he 's night with you to
The car will run, right?

163
00:21:55,124 --> 00:21:55,967
All right.

164
00:21:56,888 --> 00:22:01,033
You say it is good.
But it's still okay with you, right?

165
00:22:01,302 --> 00:22:02,491
Yeah, it goes well.

166
00:22:03,795 --> 00:22:06,329
What, what is going on?

167
00:22:07,136 --> 00:22:11,625
It's just ... perhaps, I had her do
delay should give.

168
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:15,962
Chris, no, you do not.
The bank gave her 2 times already postponed it?

169
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,187
If you do not pay your mortgage
you lose your house,

170
00:22:18,225 --> 00:22:22,447
what is expected then that woman?
This is not your fault, do not worry.

171
00:22:46,241 --> 00:22:49,004
What is, is there something wrong?

172
00:22:49,042 --> 00:22:52,303
Did you know?
- What?

173
00:22:52,457 --> 00:22:54,068
Really?

174
00:22:55,297 --> 00:22:57,523
No, what do you mean?

175
00:23:01,054 --> 00:23:04,393
I know this sounds weird, but I
want to go to a soothsayer.

176
00:23:06,694 --> 00:23:09,343
Now, you kidding?

177
00:23:10,418 --> 00:23:13,143
Come on Chris, I will predict your future.

178
00:23:13,334 --> 00:23:16,712
Eh ... in the near future, we get into the
car and go home to relax.

179
00:23:16,712 --> 00:23:17,861
Do not!

180
00:23:18,592 --> 00:23:20,665
Why, by what happened
to that old woman?

181
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:24,155
Chris, I really think that we should go home now.

182
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:27,917
Would you do it for me?

183
00:23:35,514 --> 00:23:37,549
If my students could see me now ...

184
00:23:39,391 --> 00:23:43,343
is the only lesson I can teach them,
hypocritical, one on one.

185
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,640
So many things to choose from, but
not what I seek.

186
00:23:48,679 --> 00:23:52,900
And that's a weird dried head of a monkey.
Oh, wait, never mind, he is al

187
00:23:55,432 --> 00:23:56,967
I'm Rham Jas.

188
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,311
Nice that you are there.

189
00:23:58,426 --> 00:24:00,305
I'm Christine, and it is Clay.

190
00:24:00,612 --> 00:24:02,455
But did you know not?

191
00:24:04,566 --> 00:24:05,985
I'm just kidding.

192
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:09,669
What can I do for you?
- I want you predict my future.

193
00:24:09,861 --> 00:24:14,082
Can you?
- I can see some energy.

194
00:24:14,122 --> 00:24:17,421
Sometimes that energy says something about
the things to come.

195
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:19,955
That is $ 60, please.
- Are you serious?

196
00:24:20,031 --> 00:24:22,027
Yes.
- 60 ...

197
00:24:22,295 --> 00:24:25,902
Is not that a bit expensive, do?
- You're not serious.

198
00:24:25,902 --> 00:24:29,087
Please, do it.
- Well, come on, Chris.

199
00:24:29,087 --> 00:24:30,585
Wait, wait, I pay.

200
00:24:30,623 --> 00:24:34,998
Oh, you know what, here it is.

201
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:36,724
Please.

202
00:24:37,339 --> 00:24:39,680
A platinum card, very well.

203
00:24:44,861 --> 00:24:46,281
Thank you.

204
00:24:46,894 --> 00:24:48,967
Here, here.
- Thanks.

205
00:24:52,919 --> 00:24:54,263
No, please.

206
00:24:57,026 --> 00:25:00,249
So you want to know something about your fate?
- Yes.

207
00:24:59,865 --> 00:25:02,360
Very well, let what the future
has in store for you.

208
00:25:02,398 --> 00:25:04,701
Freud said that nothing in the future
you lot had to do,

209
00:25:04,701 --> 00:25:08,194
but rather something that the subconscious,
created to make choices.

210
00:25:08,347 --> 00:25:11,148
True, but you can not the world
all contain

211
00:25:11,763 --> 00:25:13,182
only with the mind.

212
00:25:13,259 --> 00:25:15,715
Oh, Karl Jung.
- Yes.

213
00:25:15,983 --> 00:25:17,556
From his writings.

214
00:25:17,633 --> 00:25:22,431
Psychological characterisations.
- Favorite psychologist of our time.

215
00:25:22,469 --> 00:25:24,733
He was at least not afraid to God in his
considerations, to take.

216
00:25:23,774 --> 00:25:26,306
Well, he was not afraid of God ...

217
00:25:26,344 --> 00:25:29,376
Clay, please.
- Well let's start, come on.

218
00:25:29,376 --> 00:25:30,106
Shall we?

219
00:25:30,144 --> 00:25:31,296
I'm ready.

220
00:25:31,755 --> 00:25:34,980
Give me your hand, please.
- Okay.

221
00:25:43,153 --> 00:25:44,765
You work with money.

222
00:25:45,878 --> 00:25:47,144
That's right.

223
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:50,330
And you've recently lost something.

224
00:25:52,556 --> 00:25:57,775
No, no, I do not.
- No, you do not lose anything ...

225
00:25:58,656 --> 00:26:01,152
but there is something taken away from you.

226
00:26:01,997 --> 00:26:03,225
No.

227
00:26:03,878 --> 00:26:05,756
A knot.
- Oh my God.

228
00:26:05,987 --> 00:26:07,023
Yes.

229
00:26:07,368 --> 00:26:09,058
What does it matter if it's a
node is lost ...

230
00:26:09,096 --> 00:26:12,780
Clay, which was very strange, the old woman
pulled a button from my sleeve.

231
00:26:12,819 --> 00:26:16,349
Why would she do that?
- Do you sometimes just silent?

232
00:27:25,924 --> 00:27:27,958
I think this is enough for tonight.

233
00:27:27,996 --> 00:27:29,148
What's wrong?

234
00:27:29,379 --> 00:27:32,410
I'm tired and I see it
late become.

235
00:27:32,717 --> 00:27:35,671
I will of course refund your money.
- Wait, wait ...

236
00:27:35,902 --> 00:27:37,437
Have you seen something?

237
00:27:38,397 --> 00:27:41,313
You will be followed by a bad spirit.
- What do you mean?

238
00:27:41,505 --> 00:27:43,808
No ...
- Have you disturbed the dead in the cemetery?

239
00:27:43,885 --> 00:27:47,492
No.
- Something with a Ouija board or black magic?

240
00:27:47,761 --> 00:27:51,061
Okay, calm down, man, come on.
Wait, wait, no, no.

241
00:27:51,482 --> 00:27:53,939
Perhaps, someone has cursed you.

242
00:27:59,695 --> 00:28:01,691
But how he knew all that.

243
00:28:01,729 --> 00:28:03,802
Did some ... that you had lost a button?

244
00:28:04,339 --> 00:28:07,217
He knew little, he gambled well
on a few things ...

245
00:28:07,217 --> 00:28:10,556
He makes you upset and leave you with
all these questions.

246
00:28:10,633 --> 00:28:13,510
And of course with his business card.

247
00:28:13,779 --> 00:28:16,389
Come on Chris, he is a crook.

248
00:28:16,581 --> 00:28:19,575
But he wanted the money, he wanted
rendering, remember?

249
00:28:20,341 --> 00:28:23,527
Well, he did have one attempt, but he has
ultimately, is not accepted?

250
00:28:26,059 --> 00:28:27,441
Yeah, I guess.

251
00:28:50,582 --> 00:28:52,884
I need to go check on the
repair of your car goes, manage that?

252
00:28:52,884 --> 00:28:53,575
Yes.
- Okay.

253
00:28:53,806 --> 00:28:56,798
Kitty, care for her.
- I'm back in an hour.

254
00:32:36,885 --> 00:32:38,842
Here, hold it against your lip.
- Thank you.

255
00:32:38,919 --> 00:32:41,989
I can not believe they came here
is, this is really ridiculous.

256
00:32:42,181 --> 00:32:43,448
It was not.

257
00:32:43,716 --> 00:32:44,868
Who was it?

258
00:32:45,136 --> 00:32:48,437
I do not know, I could not see.
- Of course it was, that could not otherwise.

259
00:32:48,475 --> 00:32:52,580
No, Clay, there was none.
- It was a man, Chris, it was someone.

260
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:56,380
The light was out and I saw who it was ...
- Clay, there was nobody here!

261
00:32:57,839 --> 00:32:59,335
But who did this?

262
00:33:01,178 --> 00:33:02,904
Who has beaten you in your face?

263
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:12,844
I think the reaction on the fact
she was attacked, earlier today.

264
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:15,068
A classic case of post traumatic stress.

265
00:33:15,107 --> 00:33:18,407
Yes, she shows signs of panic,
is a bit paranoid, so ...

266
00:33:18,407 --> 00:33:21,631
Wait, I will just exhaust you.
- No, no, it succeeds.

267
00:33:28,233 --> 00:33:30,650
How are you?
- It's better.

268
00:33:30,918 --> 00:33:34,871
Especially after the doctor has explained to me.
He said that victims of violence,

269
00:33:35,216 --> 00:33:37,403
relive the trauma.

270
00:33:37,595 --> 00:33:41,203
I did not ... did not know what it was.

271
00:33:41,701 --> 00:33:42,776
That happens sometimes.

272
00:33:43,352 --> 00:33:45,770
I ... I feel ...

273
00:33:46,767 --> 00:33:50,067
a little embarrassed.
- That you kidding, no ...

274
00:33:50,183 --> 00:33:51,986
You do for me never be ashamed.

275
00:34:00,812 --> 00:34:03,384
Listen, I thought we maybe small trip
could make.

276
00:34:03,423 --> 00:34:05,917
We deal Saturday and then the train
to Santa Barbara ...

277
00:34:05,955 --> 00:34:06,684
The cabin of your parents?

278
00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:09,677
Yes, if you like.
- Oh, my God, how nice.

279
00:34:09,716 --> 00:34:11,904
Yeah, okay.
- That seems so exciting.

280
00:34:11,942 --> 00:34:13,171
Honey, you'll be great.

281
00:34:13,438 --> 00:34:16,854
There is much to see.
There are trees and it is very private ...

282
00:34:16,854 --> 00:34:19,272
It is amazing, really good.
I think we need ...

283
00:34:19,579 --> 00:34:22,533
and then we ...
we can just talk.

284
00:36:24,991 --> 00:36:26,104
What?

285
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:28,599
What's on?

286
00:36:29,214 --> 00:36:30,979
I could ... I could not wake up.

287
00:36:32,552 --> 00:36:34,356
It's okay.
It is good.

288
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:36,926
Come on, it was only a dream.

289
00:36:48,593 --> 00:36:50,972
That is the rental car they
have delivered this morning.

290
00:36:51,317 --> 00:36:53,158
That is fine.
- Certainly.

291
00:36:53,812 --> 00:36:55,924
I love you.
- I love you.

292
00:36:57,458 --> 00:37:01,947
Hey baby ... try today, no old
ladies angry, okay?

293
00:37:19,754 --> 00:37:23,783
Hey, Christine ... are you just here?
- You thought I would come later?

294
00:37:23,859 --> 00:37:25,894
Haha, very funny, Christine.

295
00:37:26,777 --> 00:37:27,775
What is this?

296
00:37:29,042 --> 00:37:30,192
What do you want?

297
00:37:30,729 --> 00:37:32,994
I want you to teach me the right procedures.

298
00:37:35,681 --> 00:37:38,137
I'm busy, can we do tomorrow?

299
00:37:38,443 --> 00:37:39,902
Well.
- Okay.

300
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:42,242
I would say you now Mr. Jacks
not have time, maybe ...

301
00:37:42,281 --> 00:37:45,619
No, no ... Okay, I'll do it.

302
00:37:45,927 --> 00:37:51,108
Well, we talked about the guidelines for
the collateral of the loans.

303
00:37:51,491 --> 00:37:56,096
Okay, Latsia Client is a company that no
traditional bank financing can do.

304
00:38:06,803 --> 00:38:07,992
And ...

305
00:38:08,223 --> 00:38:09,335
And ...

306
00:38:14,248 --> 00:38:15,245
And ...

307
00:38:17,279 --> 00:38:18,354
And ...

308
00:38:20,810 --> 00:38:24,456
Get your dirty hands off my desk!

309
00:38:31,748 --> 00:38:34,549
Christine blood ... Brown.

310
00:38:35,009 --> 00:38:37,810
Christine ... your nose.

311
00:38:38,425 --> 00:38:40,804
Of course, you have a minute?

312
00:38:41,264 --> 00:38:44,757
Here, let me help.
- No, no, I got this under control.

313
00:38:45,832 --> 00:38:47,175
What is wrong with you?

314
00:38:48,133 --> 00:38:49,937
Mr. Jack ...
- Have what I got in my mouth?

315
00:38:50,015 --> 00:38:51,472
Oh my God!
- Got it in my mouth?

316
00:38:51,664 --> 00:38:53,583
Come along, here.

317
00:38:53,699 --> 00:38:57,152
I am so sorry!
Oh my God!

318
00:38:59,608 --> 00:39:01,335
<i> Have I got something in my mouth? </ i></i>

319
00:39:53,297 --> 00:39:54,678
What is it?

320
00:39:58,746 --> 00:40:01,969
Hi, I come to Sylvia Ganush, is she here?

321
00:40:02,354 --> 00:40:03,581
Who are you?

322
00:40:04,539 --> 00:40:07,458
I am ... a friend of hers.

323
00:40:07,649 --> 00:40:09,376
A white ...

324
00:40:12,215 --> 00:40:15,746
I know who you are, my grandmother said
all that you would come.

325
00:40:16,322 --> 00:40:19,277
You're the woman from the bank.
Those who are taking away her house.

326
00:40:19,698 --> 00:40:23,268
It was actually the bank that taking away the house.
I only work there.

327
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:27,067
I even tried the house of
your grandmother, to get back.

328
00:40:27,067 --> 00:40:28,602
But that was not my boss.

329
00:40:28,832 --> 00:40:32,593
And now you stand here in my portal
and lying to me.

330
00:40:37,582 --> 00:40:38,579
No.

331
00:40:39,078 --> 00:40:41,843
You were once a fat, is not it?

332
00:40:48,098 --> 00:40:50,553
Yes.
- I can see.

333
00:40:51,512 --> 00:40:53,085
You're not welcome here.

334
00:40:54,007 --> 00:40:58,574
Wait ... I must see her, she must forgive me.

335
00:40:58,612 --> 00:41:02,680
And I give her the house back.
- You're everything to make is that it?

336
00:41:02,718 --> 00:41:03,716
Yes.

337
00:41:05,214 --> 00:41:06,518
Come on.

338
00:41:21,139 --> 00:41:22,405
Where is she?

339
00:42:11,910 --> 00:42:15,288
Get off me!
Get off me!

340
00:42:30,676 --> 00:42:33,669
Will you still make it up to her?

341
00:42:35,204 --> 00:42:37,930
You deserve everything that happens to you now.

342
00:42:45,643 --> 00:42:48,828
I think you will be haunted by Alamia.

343
00:42:48,866 --> 00:42:50,978
That is the word that the old woman used.

344
00:42:51,016 --> 00:42:55,351
The black goat, only called by the
Gypsies, for their worst curses.

345
00:42:55,620 --> 00:42:58,920
The first 3 days will appear as a Alamia
bad spirit,

346
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:02,068
who torments his victim.
Then he reveals himself,

347
00:43:02,106 --> 00:43:06,213
as a collector of souls and pursue
owner of the cursed object.

348
00:43:06,213 --> 00:43:07,862
A cursed object, what object?

349
00:43:07,862 --> 00:43:11,125
Something of the victim is taken,
cursed and then returned.

350
00:43:14,769 --> 00:43:15,998
This?

351
00:43:18,033 --> 00:43:19,413
What if I just burned?

352
00:43:19,452 --> 00:43:24,556
The condition of the node does not matter,
You're still the owner.

353
00:43:24,786 --> 00:43:27,780
Alamia will still take you.
- Taking over where?

354
00:43:34,188 --> 00:43:36,030
How to get here from?

355
00:43:36,068 --> 00:43:38,333
You can try to deceive the mind.

356
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,559
The simplest way would be a blood sacrifice

357
00:43:40,827 --> 00:43:44,358
and a small animal would be sacrificed.
Maybe a chicken.

358
00:43:44,396 --> 00:43:49,154
No, not really. I'm vegetarian and I
worked in the puppy heart, for God's sake.

359
00:43:49,231 --> 00:43:51,189
I no dead animals.

360
00:43:51,419 --> 00:43:55,180
You'll be surprised what you would do if
Alamia, you will get.

361
00:43:57,674 --> 00:43:59,248
This is how it should happen.

362
00:47:54,070 --> 00:47:56,065
Come here, Kitty.

363
00:48:16,367 --> 00:48:18,132
Here, Kitty, Kitty.

364
00:48:30,143 --> 00:48:31,218
Chris.

365
00:48:32,561 --> 00:48:33,712
Chris.

366
00:48:35,593 --> 00:48:38,318
Oh, there you are.
what are you doing?

367
00:48:38,510 --> 00:48:40,888
At the bank they said that once you left
and you had answered the phone.

368
00:48:41,388 --> 00:48:43,690
Is that blood?

369
00:48:45,993 --> 00:48:48,679
No, why would it be blood?

370
00:48:48,794 --> 00:48:51,903
Honey, there's blood on your sleeve.

371
00:48:52,287 --> 00:48:55,702
Blood you?
- No, it's just tomato juice.

372
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:59,732
I cut a tomato in the kitchen and
it should come on my sleeve.

373
00:49:02,149 --> 00:49:06,831
Hey, Chris, why do we dinner
not another time?

374
00:49:07,062 --> 00:49:09,710
You've had a few difficult days.
Maybe better.

375
00:49:09,748 --> 00:49:12,933
No, I want to go to that dinner.
- I know, but ...

376
00:49:13,162 --> 00:49:15,044
are you sure you feel good?

377
00:49:16,501 --> 00:49:19,533
Honestly ... was not.

378
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:29,050
But I think everything is okay.

379
00:49:31,469 --> 00:49:33,119
I really believe that.

380
00:49:37,686 --> 00:49:38,875
What do you think?

381
00:49:42,635 --> 00:49:44,171
You look beautiful.

382
00:49:47,971 --> 00:49:50,311
Gosh, what a beautiful day.
- Yes, that is.

383
00:49:50,541 --> 00:49:52,574
Within it will be nice.

384
00:49:55,569 --> 00:49:56,835
They'll like it.

385
00:49:59,982 --> 00:50:02,208
Clay.
- Mom, good to see you.

386
00:50:02,208 --> 00:50:03,896
This is Christine, this is my mom, Trudy.

387
00:50:04,049 --> 00:50:07,235
Hi, Christine.
- Hello, nice to meet you.

388
00:50:08,387 --> 00:50:10,458
Please, come in, this way.

389
00:50:11,303 --> 00:50:13,221
Dad, how is it?
Good to see you.

390
00:50:13,414 --> 00:50:16,292
Eh ... This is Christine, Christine,
This is my father, Larry.

391
00:50:17,059 --> 00:50:19,785
You have a beautiful house.
- Oh, thank you.

392
00:50:21,319 --> 00:50:23,122
Can I pour?
- A wine?

393
00:50:23,506 --> 00:50:24,389
Yes, please.

394
00:50:24,619 --> 00:50:27,690
Okay, Cannula.
- I'll be back.

395
00:50:28,112 --> 00:50:30,337
For me a Chardonnay.
- Yeah, baby.

396
00:50:31,450 --> 00:50:34,214
I hope you do not mind.
- Oh, what fun.

397
00:50:34,252 --> 00:50:35,825
Self made?
- Yes.

398
00:50:36,325 --> 00:50:43,040
And how do you call that pie?
- It is ... a harvest pie.

399
00:50:43,270 --> 00:50:48,067
Is that something you created on the farm?
- No ...

400
00:50:49,947 --> 00:50:51,022
I mean not.

401
00:50:51,060 --> 00:50:56,394
We did that once, when we ...
geese have had ...

402
00:50:56,471 --> 00:51:01,614
Around the harvest, that is when the
a thick layer of goose fat to make.

403
00:51:01,805 --> 00:51:03,456
And that makes for a rich cake.

404
00:51:05,874 --> 00:51:08,098
Well, then ... Thank you.

405
00:51:08,905 --> 00:51:12,321
Look, please.
- Come along to the dining room.

406
00:51:12,359 --> 00:51:13,971
Yes, that's good.
- Good.

407
00:51:16,159 --> 00:51:18,307
Oh, Jesus.
- Hey, you, stop.

408
00:51:18,845 --> 00:51:21,723
I understand that no beast.
I hate cats.

409
00:51:21,723 --> 00:51:25,101
What weird saying, he is normally so sweet.

410
00:51:25,101 --> 00:51:27,786
That's okay.
I also had a cat, I understand.

411
00:51:29,282 --> 00:51:30,857
You have a cat.

412
00:51:32,967 --> 00:51:35,193
Whether he should have walked away.

413
00:51:37,918 --> 00:51:39,721
How would I know?

414
00:51:40,451 --> 00:51:42,907
You know how cats are, they come and go.

415
00:51:46,553 --> 00:51:47,819
That is true.

416
00:51:50,005 --> 00:51:53,344
Well, let's sit down.
- Yes, yes, please.

417
00:51:53,843 --> 00:51:55,686
How are you collecting coins, son?

418
00:51:55,878 --> 00:51:58,448
That's my father's favorite topic.

419
00:51:58,947 --> 00:52:02,900
Christine, just got a standing "Liberty"
penny found me at the bank.

420
00:52:03,015 --> 00:52:03,897
Oh, really?
- Apart not?

421
00:52:03,975 --> 00:52:04,896
Yes, it is a rare coin.

422
00:52:05,087 --> 00:52:08,235
That job at the counter of the bank,
is so difficult for you.

423
00:52:08,350 --> 00:52:11,880
With all that counting and repeating ...
it'll be boring.

424
00:52:11,918 --> 00:52:14,797
Yes, you're right, but I
'm not a desk assistant.

425
00:52:14,797 --> 00:52:16,869
O?
- Mom, Christine handles loans.

426
00:52:17,060 --> 00:52:20,246
It makes loans to small businesses and
private houses at the bank.

427
00:52:20,285 --> 00:52:23,585
And they will probably get a promotion, so ...
Is not it, Chris?

428
00:52:23,854 --> 00:52:27,000
If successful, the account which I
am doing, that would certainly help.

429
00:52:27,115 --> 00:52:28,996
This is an important loan.

430
00:52:29,034 --> 00:52:31,298
It is the biggest of my branch,
has ever issued.

431
00:52:31,759 --> 00:52:33,370
And that is how you ended up?

432
00:52:34,253 --> 00:52:36,442
Well ... I read the "Wall Street Journal '

433
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:40,047
and was a medical products company
against, who wanted to expand out.

434
00:52:40,087 --> 00:52:44,768
But who have not had the liquidity.
So I presented the director a formula,

435
00:52:44,806 --> 00:52:47,301
their long-term loans to restructure.

436
00:52:47,608 --> 00:52:49,872
It sounds like it goes very well
with you, Christine.

437
00:52:50,140 --> 00:52:52,059
Your mother must be very proud of you.

438
00:52:53,058 --> 00:52:54,210
I think so.

439
00:53:00,004 --> 00:53:02,690
I have my mother, not recently seen.
- Why is that?

440
00:53:02,843 --> 00:53:05,646
It is ... it is a private matter.

441
00:53:05,684 --> 00:53:07,103
I talk with Christine.

442
00:53:11,285 --> 00:53:16,007
Since my father is deceased,
they do not talk much.

443
00:53:16,083 --> 00:53:22,722
She resides on the farm and
is much like himself, because ...

444
00:53:23,297 --> 00:53:24,525
Want?

445
00:53:24,871 --> 00:53:28,478
Because her husband is deceased,
she wants her own.

446
00:53:28,594 --> 00:53:31,280
Why ...
- Because my mother is an alcoholic.

447
00:53:35,616 --> 00:53:37,036
I'm sorry.

448
00:53:37,651 --> 00:53:40,759
That is really not something to be ashamed.

449
00:53:41,489 --> 00:53:44,136
I must tell you honestly that I really
find refreshing.

450
00:53:45,211 --> 00:53:48,703
My father had a drinking problem and
I was ashamed to admit it.

451
00:53:49,662 --> 00:53:51,273
You have backbone.

452
00:53:52,003 --> 00:53:54,804
I thought that last girl like that you
brought, what was her name?

453
00:53:54,919 --> 00:53:55,879
Alice.

454
00:53:55,917 --> 00:53:56,877
We do not ...
- Alicia.

455
00:53:56,915 --> 00:53:58,565
Alicia.
- That was very bad.

456
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:02,211
Bad mannered and absolutely no ambition.

457
00:54:02,288 --> 00:54:04,168
He met her through the internet.
That is the reason.

458
00:54:04,206 --> 00:54:06,355
On the Internet ... Who says that?

459
00:54:06,394 --> 00:54:09,426
Did you expect of him?
- No, not really.

460
00:54:10,308 --> 00:54:15,336
Shall we take some of your pie?
- He looks very hot.

461
00:54:16,333 --> 00:54:20,900
You'll not only enjoy it,
if you hate delicious things.

462
00:54:32,258 --> 00:54:33,910
Harvest pie huh?
- That's right.

463
00:54:33,910 --> 00:54:35,559
I want the recipe.
- It tastes very full, right?

464
00:54:35,942 --> 00:54:37,479
Did you hear anything?

465
00:54:38,246 --> 00:54:40,472
No, are you okay?

466
00:54:41,853 --> 00:54:43,926
How do you know?
- Yes very nice.

467
00:54:44,846 --> 00:54:49,107
Mom, I met her via the internet.
That is a bit misleading ...

468
00:55:07,336 --> 00:55:09,023
You must not do so
find no partner.

469
00:55:09,447 --> 00:55:13,129
You can change the things you hear or things,
they write, no trust.

470
00:55:13,629 --> 00:55:16,162
And the pictures are often not real.
Is not that so?

471
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:18,465
Yes, that's true.
- It's not that you must think,

472
00:55:18,465 --> 00:55:20,766
that people of good birth and successfully,

473
00:55:20,959 --> 00:55:22,762
flirts off potential, could be.

474
00:55:22,992 --> 00:55:25,908
You're talking about bars.
- That is such a strange situation, it is ...

475
00:55:34,544 --> 00:55:36,155
... do not you, Christine?

476
00:55:38,649 --> 00:55:41,220
No, no, course not.

477
00:55:41,606 --> 00:55:45,328
What we have done, we are together
met in a bar, right Chris?

478
00:55:45,519 --> 00:55:47,170
Oh my God, yes, that is.
- Shit.

479
00:55:47,245 --> 00:55:48,551
You must set priorities.

480
00:55:48,628 --> 00:55:51,890
The agency relationship was not Mom,
it was a bar.

481
00:55:52,964 --> 00:55:54,997
So, we met in a bar.

482
00:55:55,228 --> 00:55:57,185
And we agreed via the Internet.

483
00:55:57,916 --> 00:55:58,988
You okay?

484
00:56:00,294 --> 00:56:01,445
Okay?

485
00:56:02,251 --> 00:56:03,364
Here, have some ...

486
00:56:03,555 --> 00:56:05,052
It was something from her plate.

487
00:56:06,741 --> 00:56:08,045
Oh my God!

488
00:56:19,519 --> 00:56:21,133
Sorry, I do not know ...

489
00:56:28,385 --> 00:56:33,720
Okay, I hear you, leave me alone,
leave me the hell alone!

490
00:56:34,026 --> 00:56:35,752
Please, there is none.

491
00:56:41,855 --> 00:56:45,078
I think I should go.
- Yeah, I think that is the best.

492
00:56:46,191 --> 00:56:49,339
Hey Chris ...
- Do not go after her, she is sick.

493
00:56:49,416 --> 00:56:52,024
No, she does my help.
- Let her go.

494
00:56:53,789 --> 00:56:55,018
Chris!

495
00:56:56,054 --> 00:56:57,474
What's on?

496
00:56:58,396 --> 00:57:02,539
Well, I did what you said!
I've killed that pussy.

497
00:57:02,769 --> 00:57:04,497
You're a jerk!

498
00:57:04,535 --> 00:57:09,333
These are illustrious and powerful forces, we
face. There are no guarantees!

499
00:57:26,025 --> 00:57:29,097
You should talk directly with the black spirit.

500
00:57:29,326 --> 00:57:31,743
You should avoid it steals your soul.

501
00:57:31,974 --> 00:57:35,236
And fast.
I know someone who can help us.

502
00:57:35,274 --> 00:57:37,192
And I should trust you?

503
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:41,683
Tomorrow is the third day.
Alamia then come after you.

504
00:57:41,837 --> 00:57:43,218
We must not let this happen!

505
00:57:43,909 --> 00:57:47,018
But you must understand ...
that the woman who can help us,

506
00:57:47,056 --> 00:57:49,511
themselves in serious danger.

507
00:57:49,549 --> 00:57:51,238
And she will not do for free.

508
00:57:51,584 --> 00:57:53,196
What you need from me?

509
00:57:53,349 --> 00:57:58,338
$ 10,000 ... cash.
Tomorrow.

510
00:58:10,849 --> 00:58:13,267
Mr. Jacks.
- Yes.

511
00:58:13,421 --> 00:58:17,871
This is a bit strange for me
and I know that it is not official.

512
00:58:18,524 --> 00:58:22,055
But I was wondering if I advance
could get.

513
00:58:22,055 --> 00:58:24,280
With regard to promotion to
assistant manager?

514
00:58:24,395 --> 00:58:28,041
Yes. One of my family is seriously ill.

515
00:58:28,770 --> 00:58:31,726
Not fatal, but it is possible.
- Christine ...

516
00:58:31,764 --> 00:58:32,954
There is a problem.

517
00:58:32,954 --> 00:58:35,946
The McPherson contract
canceled last night.

518
00:58:36,139 --> 00:58:37,865
What?
- Yes.

519
00:58:38,403 --> 00:58:41,895
Just when I had said that the regional manager
This is great loan was coming ...

520
00:58:41,972 --> 00:58:44,965
I heard they had closed a deal
with "First National".

521
00:58:45,464 --> 00:58:48,265
I still have a call to what whores
exactly happened, but ...

522
00:58:48,265 --> 00:58:52,256
Now does not this look so good
for you and me.

523
00:58:52,563 --> 00:58:57,629
So the promotion to assistant manager,
is postponed.

524
00:58:57,899 --> 00:59:00,737
I even think that anything that happened,

525
00:59:00,776 --> 00:59:03,961
this job I will have to give Stu.

526
00:59:04,614 --> 00:59:07,070
Stu ... I understand.

527
00:59:07,415 --> 00:59:10,063
Sorry, look, if you
family problems,

528
00:59:10,063 --> 00:59:13,095
you might have to take time off today.
These things happen.

529
01:00:17,643 --> 01:00:19,139
What is that?

530
01:00:19,255 --> 01:00:23,015
3800 for everything.
- Includes my jewelry?

531
01:00:23,131 --> 01:00:26,623
Included.
- But this is much more valuable.

532
01:00:27,045 --> 01:00:31,229
Please?
This is everything I have, I pray you

533
01:00:32,226 --> 01:00:34,029
It is a choice of parts.

534
01:00:42,435 --> 01:00:44,813
Chris ... Chris.

535
01:00:47,460 --> 01:00:48,689
Honey?

536
01:01:07,072 --> 01:01:09,374
I thought you would not eat.

537
01:01:10,718 --> 01:01:15,860
I thought ... I'm late but,
I even eat ice cream.

538
01:01:19,198 --> 01:01:21,193
I've paid Rham Jas.

539
01:01:24,034 --> 01:01:27,833
What ... you love me for a fool.

540
01:01:28,062 --> 01:01:33,590
I paid him.
- What, I thought you did not believe me.

541
01:01:33,819 --> 01:01:36,468
I do not know, I still believe.

542
01:01:36,812 --> 01:01:41,265
I really do not know, but I do know,
that you believe in here.

543
01:01:41,418 --> 01:01:47,327
I know how important it is for you and
how much pain you do it.

544
01:01:47,788 --> 01:01:49,132
And uh ...

545
01:01:50,283 --> 01:01:57,767
and I also remember, I remember one
promise, which I did and was in love with you.

546
01:01:58,074 --> 01:02:00,260
I told myself that I ...

547
01:02:01,104 --> 01:02:05,364
I would always watch over you.
And you should care.

548
01:02:06,477 --> 01:02:08,243
So I let him pay.

549
01:02:10,813 --> 01:02:13,845
Remember the day you
was in love with me?

550
01:02:13,883 --> 01:02:16,148
To the second even.

551
01:02:18,451 --> 01:02:20,177
Oh my God.

552
01:02:32,227 --> 01:02:34,453
Are you sure I would go with
to within?

553
01:02:34,529 --> 01:02:38,982
He said I just had to come.
- Yes, he told me.

554
01:03:13,903 --> 01:03:18,815
Christine, I can imagine ...
Shaun San Dena.

555
01:03:21,578 --> 01:03:25,148
Welcome.
- Pleasant.

556
01:03:25,263 --> 01:03:30,520
Shaun San Dena is an experienced medium.
Furthermore, she has had contact with Alamia.

557
01:03:30,635 --> 01:03:33,821
I am the spirit come first,
many years ago,

558
01:03:34,128 --> 01:03:35,586
in this house.

559
01:03:36,047 --> 01:03:38,771
And ... what happened?

560
01:03:39,923 --> 01:03:43,607
I lost ... the soul of a boy ...

561
01:03:43,876 --> 01:03:45,296
the beast.

562
01:03:49,708 --> 01:03:57,845
I have waited many years for me
to take revenge.

563
01:03:58,266 --> 01:04:01,567
And bad thing to destroy.

564
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:04,829
Can I be on?
Please?

565
01:04:08,551 --> 01:04:12,236
tonight ...
Will I have the chance.

566
01:04:12,580 --> 01:04:14,883
But for him to call,

567
01:04:15,037 --> 01:04:20,179
I need your help.
Can you strong enough?

568
01:04:21,945 --> 01:04:23,978
I will try.

569
01:04:28,161 --> 01:04:31,461
My deceased husband, Sandok,
was also a medium.

570
01:04:31,615 --> 01:04:37,947
He has chosen this house because he felt
that certain forces are present.

571
01:04:38,676 --> 01:04:45,622
In this house there are some ...
conditions exist.

572
01:04:45,852 --> 01:04:50,074
You can find some open ports, so
we can see what happens.

573
01:04:50,113 --> 01:04:53,605
Certain actions can
a kind of door opening,

574
01:04:53,835 --> 01:04:55,447
where we can go through.

575
01:04:55,178 --> 01:04:59,514
But also, so we can feel things ...
what to do in this world.

576
01:04:59,629 --> 01:05:02,661
And in her world so others can come.

577
01:05:08,073 --> 01:05:10,220
Please, sit down.

578
01:05:37,045 --> 01:05:38,235
What happens?

579
01:05:38,274 --> 01:05:41,229
Everything we do is to help you.
- Please!

580
01:05:42,150 --> 01:05:44,491
Christine ... please.

581
01:05:48,905 --> 01:05:50,324
Thank you.

582
01:06:08,131 --> 01:06:13,350
Holy Spirit ... To us
work, bless ...

583
01:06:19,337 --> 01:06:23,290
If the spirit in me, put my hand
than the beast.

584
01:06:23,328 --> 01:06:26,513
Do you understand?
- Yes.

585
01:06:26,590 --> 01:06:29,660
I force the spirit of the Alamia,
the goat to go.

586
01:06:31,080 --> 01:06:33,574
Milos, then save.
- Yes, I'll do that.

587
01:06:33,613 --> 01:06:35,185
Here!
And hard, you hear?

588
01:06:35,339 --> 01:06:36,605
I understand.

589
01:06:47,158 --> 01:06:49,193
We should be open.

590
01:07:03,392 --> 01:07:04,850
What should I do?

591
01:07:05,003 --> 01:07:07,268
You must let the darkness.

592
01:07:07,460 --> 01:07:10,530
You should invite your dead spirit.

593
01:07:11,375 --> 01:07:14,521
I'm afraid.
- Yes ...

594
01:07:14,636 --> 01:07:16,210
Repeat these words ...

595
01:07:16,825 --> 01:07:19,549
I welcome the dead ...
in my soul.

596
01:07:22,465 --> 01:07:26,072
I welcome the dead in my soul.
- You gotta believe!

597
01:07:26,609 --> 01:07:29,565
I welcome the dead in my soul.

598
01:07:30,370 --> 01:07:34,093
I welcome the dead in my soul.

599
01:07:34,246 --> 01:07:37,585
I welcome the dead in my soul.

600
01:07:37,815 --> 01:07:40,962
I welcome the dead in my soul.

601
01:07:52,629 --> 01:07:55,468
We wait holy spirits,
are you with us?

602
01:08:06,483 --> 01:08:09,398
Something else is here with us.

603
01:08:10,012 --> 01:08:11,816
Yes.

604
01:08:38,757 --> 01:08:42,249
This is not Alamia.
It is ...

605
01:08:42,902 --> 01:08:46,509
the spirit of a lost soul.

606
01:08:46,662 --> 01:08:48,312
From years ago.

607
01:08:48,658 --> 01:08:51,958
Sometimes hanging with you for the Perplexed
around the door.

608
01:08:52,648 --> 01:08:55,794
There are more, here.

609
01:09:05,081 --> 01:09:09,879
Say what spirit.
Mind, say what!

610
01:09:20,970 --> 01:09:23,081
He is coming.

611
01:11:01,323 --> 01:11:04,470
He has the body of Shaun San Dena,
taken possession.

612
01:11:08,116 --> 01:11:13,680
Alamia ...

613
01:11:16,751 --> 01:11:19,168
Alamia, what you want?

614
01:11:19,321 --> 01:11:23,351
I want the soul of Christine Brown!

615
01:11:23,658 --> 01:11:26,997
We will take possession of her body,
to celebrate the brave.

616
01:11:27,035 --> 01:11:30,105
No, it was my manager, Jim jackets.
He was the ...

617
01:11:29,722 --> 01:11:35,592
Stil ... Alamia, I ask you this meaningless
women, not to take.

618
01:11:35,709 --> 01:11:38,510
She is certainly not worthy of your greatness.

619
01:11:46,837 --> 01:11:48,564
No!

620
01:11:51,979 --> 01:11:55,932
I come to you, Christine.

621
01:11:57,351 --> 01:12:00,000
You are mine!

622
01:12:03,991 --> 01:12:08,826
No ... You tricked me there!
You whore with a black heart!

623
01:12:09,019 --> 01:12:12,165
Milos now ... now!
- You whore!

624
01:12:24,216 --> 01:12:26,134
Go away, you evil spirit!

625
01:12:41,523 --> 01:12:42,712
Alamia!

626
01:12:43,288 --> 01:12:44,900
I'm the one who has called you,
in this circle.

627
01:12:45,092 --> 01:12:47,548
I recommend you leave this house now!

628
01:12:50,004 --> 01:12:52,498
She has nice breasts!

629
01:12:53,727 --> 01:12:55,837
Christine ...

630
01:13:01,171 --> 01:13:06,083
I do not want your cat, but you!
Little whores queen!

631
01:13:16,676 --> 01:13:21,088
Shaun San Dena!
You must exorcise the spirit!

632
01:13:21,433 --> 01:13:22,508
Yes.

633
01:13:53,132 --> 01:13:54,284
Milos!

634
01:13:57,046 --> 01:13:59,119
I'm fine.
- My God!

635
01:13:59,195 --> 01:14:01,345
I'm fine.
- Oh my God.

636
01:14:03,378 --> 01:14:05,720
You did it.
- Thank God.

637
01:14:07,369 --> 01:14:10,287
I've tried ...
- You okay?

638
01:14:10,594 --> 01:14:12,781
Oh my God ... help me!

639
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:18,575
Internal bleeding.

640
01:14:22,528 --> 01:14:24,063
She still breathes?

641
01:14:25,407 --> 01:14:26,596
No.

642
01:14:29,973 --> 01:14:31,393
Oh God.

643
01:15:10,767 --> 01:15:13,799
It is sad.
- Yes.

644
01:15:13,913 --> 01:15:15,909
Strange how things work.

645
01:15:16,139 --> 01:15:20,553
She had waited 40 years, the probability
Alamia to overcome.

646
01:15:21,589 --> 01:15:27,000
And on the last night of her
life, is successful.

647
01:15:27,077 --> 01:15:29,342
I think you've misunderstood.

648
01:15:30,646 --> 01:15:33,447
Alamia can not be averted
through a medium.

649
01:15:33,715 --> 01:15:36,556
That was the lesson of last night.
Sorry.

650
01:15:36,670 --> 01:15:42,159
But I saw that she overcame.
- No, she drove him from the seance.

651
01:15:41,237 --> 01:15:45,843
He comes back.
The goat was not slain.

652
01:15:46,150 --> 01:15:48,797
And when it gets dark ...

653
01:15:48,874 --> 01:15:52,712
Alamia is the owner of
the cursed object.

654
01:15:55,935 --> 01:15:58,623
Of course you would, now not
the owner must be more.

655
01:15:58,775 --> 01:15:59,965
Got the knot?

656
01:16:08,062 --> 01:16:12,360
Give it away, then
you have given away the curse.

657
01:16:14,892 --> 01:16:16,773
Why did not you do this before?

658
01:16:16,889 --> 01:16:20,381
Because the Alamia will take the soul of
person to whom you give the knot.

659
01:16:20,535 --> 01:16:22,529
And forever will burn in hell.

660
01:16:24,602 --> 01:16:30,551
And that would be my fault.
- And I am guilty.

661
01:16:31,779 --> 01:16:36,651
Whatever you decide.
- He has left a warning.

662
01:16:55,533 --> 01:16:57,106
Is it over?

663
01:16:58,181 --> 01:16:59,793
It is over.

664
01:17:08,312 --> 01:17:10,768
You'll burn in hell!

665
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:15,681
You'll burn in hell!
- You whore, you will burn in hell!

666
01:17:15,871 --> 01:17:17,715
Your time is coming!

667
01:17:17,906 --> 01:17:19,327
You'll burn in ...

668
01:17:19,364 --> 01:17:20,976
Okay?

669
01:17:21,398 --> 01:17:23,279
Jesus say.

670
01:17:36,903 --> 01:17:38,860
Do you still feel like our trip,
to Santa Barbara? - Yes.

671
01:17:38,898 --> 01:17:40,817
Yes, that's good.
- Okay, what time will you pick me?

672
01:17:41,047 --> 01:17:44,885
It's better when I come to the station.
I must go do something.

673
01:17:45,076 --> 01:17:46,918
I can do.
I will on the way to ...

674
01:17:46,996 --> 01:17:49,797
No, no, I have it all under control.

675
01:17:50,027 --> 01:17:52,828
See you then at 07.30 hours.
- Where is my envelope?

676
01:17:52,867 --> 01:17:55,284
What envelope?
- He sat in my bag, I had him just yet.

677
01:17:55,438 --> 01:17:57,587
It's just one envelope.
- No, he should be here.

678
01:17:57,625 --> 01:18:00,159
He is here, so we will also
eventually found.

679
01:18:00,810 --> 01:18:05,454
My God, I thought I had lost him.
Ok.

680
01:18:06,029 --> 01:18:07,948
07.30, on time!

681
01:18:43,485 --> 01:18:45,518
Are you sure that you do not want anything?

682
01:18:45,749 --> 01:18:49,702
No, so you'll just sit still
which is it?

683
01:18:49,740 --> 01:18:53,040
Yes, perhaps, what of that?

684
01:18:53,078 --> 01:18:56,954
Honey, I earn through tips and
Coffee drinkers do not match.

685
01:18:57,070 --> 01:19:01,253
Bljf with the coffee, then I give you
a tip that you'll never forget.

686
01:19:41,087 --> 01:19:45,385
What looks good out there, say.

687
01:19:45,461 --> 01:19:49,453
You are the sweetest in the world.

688
01:19:50,797 --> 01:19:53,482
It does not in question, Stu.
You will ensure that you are over 10 minutes

689
01:19:53,521 --> 01:19:56,131
I tell Mr. Jacks or something you do not
I want to tell him.

690
01:19:56,438 --> 01:20:01,925
Oh yes, what then?
- First you that the McPherson case,

691
01:20:02,078 --> 01:20:04,381
stolen from my desk and have to
"First National" have given.

692
01:20:04,804 --> 01:20:06,568
And now you have 9 minutes.

693
01:20:10,406 --> 01:20:13,131
Enter only one.
- Really?

694
01:20:20,538 --> 01:20:23,224
Please, Christine, betrayed me.

695
01:20:23,416 --> 01:20:26,525
It was not intentional.
- What do you want?

696
01:20:26,563 --> 01:20:29,863
I have something to give a small gift.

697
01:20:29,978 --> 01:20:34,469
A gift, I do not understand, I thought
you called me here to ...

698
01:20:34,661 --> 01:20:36,310
that case the 'First National'.

699
01:20:36,387 --> 01:20:38,881
Listen, you do not understand.
Just shut up!

700
01:20:41,069 --> 01:20:45,481
That gift, which I will give you, is your
possession, you own it, okay?

701
01:20:48,553 --> 01:20:49,972
Well.

702
01:20:54,846 --> 01:20:56,113
Well.

703
01:20:59,144 --> 01:21:00,486
What?

704
01:21:01,562 --> 01:21:06,321
Forget it.
- I thought of punishment for that loan.

705
01:21:06,282 --> 01:21:07,932
Go.

706
01:21:10,579 --> 01:21:14,187
Okay, thank you, Christine.

707
01:21:19,905 --> 01:21:22,092
But you betray me, huh?
- Go away!

708
01:21:32,915 --> 01:21:35,217
Who can I give?

709
01:21:44,351 --> 01:21:47,037
GANUSH SYLVIA

710
01:21:55,020 --> 01:21:57,283
Well ... is that possible?

711
01:21:58,280 --> 01:22:01,083
There are blessings gypsy
also working with the dead.

712
01:22:01,236 --> 01:22:05,495
They give gifts to the deceased who
appropriate to their souls.

713
01:22:05,649 --> 01:22:07,913
But in reality,
the soul never dies.

714
01:22:09,295 --> 01:22:14,245
Yeah, I think you have to curse someone
can give, who is deceased.

715
01:22:14,514 --> 01:22:17,892
But you must have a formal gift,
to make of the deceased.

716
01:22:17,930 --> 01:22:22,228
I know something better than that, I push
by her throat.

717
01:23:31,919 --> 01:23:34,989
GANUSH

718
01:24:05,574 --> 01:24:34,931
I give it back to you!

719
01:24:09,642 --> 01:24:11,560
And you take him from me.

720
01:24:13,288 --> 01:24:15,206
You want him back?

721
01:24:17,393 --> 01:24:19,197
Take it!

722
01:24:32,130 --> 01:24:34,664
Whatever you do, you'll get him.

723
01:24:39,691 --> 01:24:48,363
I ... Christine Brown, give this knot,
officially yours ... Sylvia Ganush!

724
01:24:49,591 --> 01:24:51,779
Stitch in, bitch!

725
01:25:05,785 --> 01:25:07,666
Goodbye!

726
01:26:33,015 --> 01:26:36,008
<i> Hi, Christine, leave a message ...</ i></i>

727
01:26:36,585 --> 01:26:40,268
<i> Christine, it was Jim, Jim Jacks.
Sorry to call so early, </ i></i>

728
01:26:40,498 --> 01:26:44,872
but last night, I found annoying
Information about Stu Rubin.

729
01:26:44,950 --> 01:26:48,289
It appears your records on the loan McPherson

730
01:26:48,518 --> 01:26:51,665
and tried it a deal
to do with "First National".

731
01:26:51,780 --> 01:26:53,469
I think he thought that we
would not come back.

732
01:26:53,738 --> 01:27:00,261
And that would be so, if he is not one hours
ago and you came along and blamed.

733
01:27:00,915 --> 01:27:06,517
When I confronted him with some errors in
the story, he began to cry and ...

734
01:27:06,555 --> 01:27:09,356
Well ... that we no longer.

735
01:27:09,548 --> 01:27:12,428
So I wanted to let you know that Monday morning,

736
01:27:12,810 --> 01:27:16,533
the job of assistant manager,
is waiting on you.

737
01:27:36,680 --> 01:27:37,831
Everything is okay.

738
01:27:56,060 --> 01:27:57,289
Good morning.

739
01:27:57,557 --> 01:28:01,010
Sorry we are not ...
- Oh, I ... I just want this coat.

740
01:28:01,049 --> 01:28:06,153
We are still not open.
- My friend and I go on a trip.

741
01:28:06,920 --> 01:28:08,839
There he is.

742
01:28:16,668 --> 01:28:18,050
Hi.

743
01:28:18,665 --> 01:28:22,502
Hey. there you are.
- Good to see you.

744
01:28:22,578 --> 01:28:23,537
There are so many things I have
to tell.

745
01:28:23,614 --> 01:28:25,687
Yeah, I know, but I've
all been in a row.

746
01:28:25,879 --> 01:28:27,606
Okay, go ahead.

747
01:28:27,873 --> 01:28:29,945
You always keep watch over me.

748
01:28:30,637 --> 01:28:32,363
And I thank you for it.

749
01:28:33,400 --> 01:28:38,466
And there is something ... something that
I previously could not confess.

750
01:28:38,618 --> 01:28:42,802
I had mrs Ganush a delay
give her loan.

751
01:28:42,841 --> 01:28:44,146
But I did not.

752
01:28:45,451 --> 01:28:49,365
It was my decision ...
and it was wrong of me.

753
01:28:58,459 --> 01:29:00,224
You're so, n goeierd.

754
01:29:02,795 --> 01:29:05,061
You are so beautiful now.

755
01:29:06,595 --> 01:29:07,823
Do you like my new coat?

756
01:29:07,861 --> 01:29:10,011
Yeah, well, really, what have you done with that old?

757
01:29:10,164 --> 01:29:12,160
I've discarded him and I want him
never seen.

758
01:29:12,237 --> 01:29:15,537
Oh no, get it back, see what
I've found.

759
01:29:15,614 --> 01:29:19,068
I found this in the car, eh ...

760
01:29:19,566 --> 01:29:21,945
I thought maybe you could ...

761
01:29:22,636 --> 01:29:24,363
I thought maybe ... Now he is back ...

762
01:29:24,824 --> 01:29:28,201
He still very much like my
"Liberty" quarter appears.

763
01:29:28,278 --> 01:29:31,425
The envelope ... Go, Go ...
Chris ... Chris ...

764
01:29:33,996 --> 01:29:36,106
Oh my God!
- Hey, hey, hey!

765
01:29:37,104 --> 01:29:41,324
Hey, hey, hey ... stop!
Chris, O God ...

766
01:29:42,093 --> 01:29:44,932
Hey, hey ... Hey, hey, you ...

767
01:29:45,086 --> 01:29:47,082
Oh, God, no ...

768
01:29:58,019 --> 01:30:00,053
Help me!

769
01:30:03,622 --> 01:30:05,694

770
01:30:07,690 --> 01:30:10,529
