Oh, I've got to call
this phone number.

00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:03,783
He was pretty gross.

184
00:13:03,884 --> 00:13:05,752
I mean, he was a real geek.

185
00:13:05,853 --> 00:13:07,220
He rubbed up against
me a couple times.

186
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,157
Gave me the creeps.

187
00:13:10,257 --> 00:13:12,592
I hated him.

188
00:13:12,692 --> 00:13:16,029
[Laughter]

189
00:13:19,099 --> 00:13:19,799
Hubert?

190
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,068
What a geek, man.

191
00:13:21,168 --> 00:13:22,202
He's so weird.

192
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:24,471
We used to bounce
basketballs off his head.

193
00:13:24,571 --> 00:13:27,407
We never thought he'd do
something crazy like that,

194
00:13:27,507 --> 00:13:28,842
Though, kill all those people.

195
00:13:28,942 --> 00:13:32,745
[Laughter]

196
00:13:39,219 --> 00:13:40,553
Man, Hubert?

197
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,022
You had to do what
you had to do, man.

198
00:13:42,122 --> 00:13:43,023
Cool.

199
00:13:43,123 --> 00:13:44,024
Peace.

200
00:13:44,124 --> 00:13:47,460

204
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,875
What are we gonna
do with that guy?

205
00:14:01,975 --> 00:14:03,911
I've been watching this guy
for two hours, washing that car.

206
00:14:05,145 --> 00:14:06,479
Well, you're gonna
have to get rid of him.

207
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:07,680
That... that guy's weird.

208
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:08,916
He just got outta the joint.

209
00:14:09,016 --> 00:14:10,517
Why don't you gove over
there and see about it?

210
00:14:10,617 --> 00:14:11,952
Come on.
Go see.

211
00:14:12,052 --> 00:14:13,086
Belongs to the
guy with the suit.

212
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:14,121
Check him out.

213
00:14:14,221 --> 00:14:14,854
You sure you want
me to go over there?

214
00:14:14,955 --> 00:14:15,655
Yeah.

215
00:14:15,755 --> 00:14:16,623

You take care of it.

00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:43,516
Man, I've been watching
you for a couple of hours.

220
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:45,785
You're doing a pretty
good job on this old car.

221
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:46,586
You going some place?

222

I'm going back to college.

224
00:14:50,357 --> 00:14:51,891
You're going back to college?

225
00:14:51,992 --> 00:14:53,826
Here.

226
00:14:53,927 --> 00:14:56,296
Take good care of Betty for me.

227
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,005
Go on with that.

228
00:15:05,105 --> 00:15:06,173

the same shape he's in.

NEIGHBOR: You don't want this?
MAN 2: Hell, no.

235
00:15:16,149 --> 00:15:17,217
I ain't... I ain't
drunk enough yet.

236
00:16:29,189 --> 00:16:31,258
Bullshit.

237
00:16:31,358 --> 00:16:32,059

This is bullshit.

241
00:16:50,177 --> 00:16:51,878

rat shit in here.

[Laughter]

246
00:17:26,446 --> 00:17:29,316
Wonder what's going on up there?

247
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:33,786
No more parties

Where is everyone?

261
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:42,255
School hasn't started yet.

262
00:18:42,355 --> 00:18:46,193
Registration should
have started weeks ago.

263
00:18:46,293 --> 00:18:48,127
Oh, I know.

264
00:18:48,228 --> 00:18:49,596
I know.

265
00:18:49,696 --> 00:18:52,499
I closed them down.

266
00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:55,735
Me, Hubert Whitehead.

267
00:18:55,835 --> 00:18:56,736

[Laughter]

271
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:07,914
Yeah.

272
00:19:08,014 --> 00:19:14,587
I wasted a freak here,
stabbed an egg head here.

273
00:19:14,687 --> 00:19:17,023
[Laughter]

274
00:19:17,123 --> 00:19:17,990
VOICE: Hubert.

275
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:19,459
Shut up!

00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:22,362
Hubert!

277
00:19:22,462 --> 00:19:23,330
Hubert!

278
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:24,797
Hubert!

279
00:19:24,897 --> 00:19:25,798
Hubert!

280
00:19:25,898 --> 00:19:28,401

VOICE: Hubert!

282
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,974
This is crazy!

283
00:19:35,074 --> 00:19:37,377
[Laughter]

284
00:19:37,477 --> 00:19:39,546
Why hasn't school started yet?

285
00:19:42,649 --> 00:19:45,518
VOICE: Hubert Whitehead.

286
00:19:45,618 --> 00:19:48,020
Welcome back, Hubert.

287
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,522
Goddamn it, Hubert.

288
00:19:49,622 --> 00:19:52,024
Are you nuts, bringing
a gun in here?

289
00:19:52,124 --> 00:19:53,793
Remember me?

290
00:19:53,893 --> 00:19:55,962
I'm Brad Aldridge,
the star quarterback

291
00:19:56,062 --> 00:19:58,064
Of the football team.

292
00:19:58,164 --> 00:20:00,700
I never made it to
the pros because you

293
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:04,571
Shot me at point blank
range in the forehead,

294
00:20:04,671 --> 00:20:07,540
And I died instantly.

295
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,508
Hello, Hubert.

296
00:20:08,608 --> 00:20:10,443
I'm Pamela Sue Pierson.

297
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:11,911
Remember me?

298
00:20:12,011 --> 00:20:15,448
I was head of the drama club,
but I never made it to Broadway

299
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:18,785
Because you put a
bullet in my liver,

300
00:20:18,885 --> 00:20:23,456
And I lived in sheer
torture for five minutes.

301
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:25,758
Hello, Hubert, you worm.

302
00:20:25,858 --> 00:20:27,093
Remember me?

303
00:20:27,193 --> 00:20:33,500
Connie Firestone, your dream
girl from the Tasty Freeze.

304
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:37,704
I planned on getting
married to a nice guy,

305
00:20:37,804 --> 00:20:40,973
Not a creep like you, and
having a couple of kids.

306
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:44,076
But even though Susan and I
begged and pleaded that you

307
00:20:44,176 --> 00:20:45,878
Spare us, you went
ahead and put a bullet

308
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:48,281
Through my beautiful face.

309
00:20:48,381 --> 00:20:52,619
And as I bent over gasping for
air, you never stopped firing.

310
00:20:52,719 --> 00:20:54,587
You put another
bullet in my head.

311
00:20:54,687 --> 00:20:58,057
And right before I passed
out, I lived long enough

312
00:20:58,157 --> 00:21:00,627
To see you put your
gun in Susan's mouth

313
00:21:00,727 --> 00:21:04,063
And blow the back
of her head off.

314
00:21:04,163 --> 00:21:05,532
Hi, Hubert.

315
00:21:05,632 --> 00:21:06,966
You never knew me.

316
00:21:07,066 --> 00:21:08,335
I'm Jay Beardsley.

317
00:21:08,435 --> 00:21:10,837
I was president of
the science club

318
00:21:10,937 --> 00:21:13,740
And planned on becoming
a nuclear physicist.

319
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,709
That night when you shot
Brad and Pamela Sue,

320
00:21:16,809 --> 00:21:20,146
I tried hiding from
you underneath the bed,

321
00:21:20,246 --> 00:21:22,649
But you violently ripped
the bed back and stabbed

322
00:21:22,749 --> 00:21:25,117
Me 40 times with a blue marlin.

323
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:27,587
You will never know the
pain that that big fish

324
00:21:27,687 --> 00:21:29,088
Inflicted on me.

325
00:21:29,188 --> 00:21:30,957
You shot me in
the back, you wimp.

326
00:21:31,057 --> 00:21:33,793
[Gasp]

327
00:21:33,893 --> 00:21:35,695
Why don't you come back?

328
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:37,930
What do you want from me?

329
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:42,034
Why, Hubert, we want
you to party with us!

330
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:45,472
[Laughter]

331
00:21:55,782 --> 00:21:59,386
This game is called
quarters, Hubert.

332
00:21:59,486 --> 00:22:04,591
Of course, you were too much of
a geek in college to play it,

333
00:22:04,691 --> 00:22:07,326
So I'm gonna explain
the rules to ya.

334
00:22:07,427 --> 00:22:10,062
First, you take a shot glass.

335
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:11,464
You fill it with beer.

336
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:18,771
Then you take a quarter, and
you clink it off the table

337
00:22:18,871 --> 00:22:20,106
Into a shot glass.

338
00:22:20,206 --> 00:22:23,776
If you make it in, then you
get to choose any person

339
00:22:23,876 --> 00:22:26,045
At the table you want to drink.

340
00:22:26,145 --> 00:22:31,484
But if you miss, then
you have to drink.

341
00:22:31,584 --> 00:22:35,455
Oh, and we've changed
the rules a little.

342
00:22:35,555 --> 00:22:36,255
Gun!

343
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:37,657
How'd you get a...

344
00:22:37,757 --> 00:22:42,328
BRAD: If you miss, instead of
drinking, you'll be shot by me.

345
00:22:42,429 --> 00:22:48,835
And I can choose anywhere
I want on your body.

346
00:22:48,935 --> 00:22:49,802
HUBERT: Oh, my God.

347
00:22:49,902 --> 00:22:55,141
So go ahead, Hubert.

348
00:22:55,241 --> 00:22:57,577
Zap on it.

349
00:22:57,677 --> 00:23:00,112
Oh, God.

350
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:01,113
Pamela Sue?

351
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:02,582
[Laughter]

352
00:23:02,682 --> 00:23:04,083
Jake?

353
00:23:04,183 --> 00:23:08,588
[Laughter]

354
00:23:09,656 --> 00:23:13,059
[Screaming]

355
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,028
Stop, please!

356
00:23:16,128 --> 00:23:17,029
Stop!

357
00:23:17,129 --> 00:23:19,532
Oh, don't be a party pooper!

358
00:23:19,632 --> 00:23:22,034
Hubert, try again.

359
00:23:22,134 --> 00:23:24,504
Oh, it hurts!

360
00:23:30,076 --> 00:23:33,480
Oh, have mercy, Brad.

361
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:35,748
Have mercy.

362
00:23:35,848 --> 00:23:36,583
BRAD: Have mercy?

363
00:23:36,683 --> 00:23:40,553
Oh, that's a good one, Hubert.

364
00:23:40,653 --> 00:23:41,754
[Screaming]

365
00:23:42,655 --> 00:23:44,524
Oh, of course it was!

366
00:23:44,624 --> 00:23:47,527
Now you know how it
feels to have a bullet

367
00:23:47,627 --> 00:23:49,996
Rip through your insides.

368
00:23:50,096 --> 00:23:53,966
Continue with the game!

369
00:23:54,066 --> 00:23:55,935
[Screaming]

370
00:23:56,035 --> 00:23:56,936
Ow!

371
00:23:57,036 --> 00:23:58,437
How can I continue?

372
00:23:58,538 --> 00:23:59,906
I can't even lift my arm.

373
00:24:02,975 --> 00:24:08,881
Pick the quarter up in your
mouth and drop it off the table

374
00:24:08,981 --> 00:24:10,883
Into the shot glass.

375
00:24:10,983 --> 00:24:13,886
No, Brad, I can't do this.

376
00:24:13,986 --> 00:24:15,888
Pamela Sue!

377
00:24:15,988 --> 00:24:18,390
Sue!

378
00:24:18,491 --> 00:24:20,860
Connie!

379
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,363
[Sobbing]

380
00:24:44,617 --> 00:24:45,317
[Screaming]

381
00:24:45,417 --> 00:24:47,319
That's too bad, Hubert.

382
00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:51,924
It seems you don't
have any arms left.

383
00:24:52,024 --> 00:24:52,892
No!

384
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:54,393
No!

385
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:55,562
No!

386
00:24:55,662 --> 00:24:56,362
No!

387
00:25:03,369 --> 00:25:04,771
It's them!

388
00:25:04,871 --> 00:25:06,238
I told you, it's the zombie!

389
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:07,306
They're killing me!

390
00:25:07,406 --> 00:25:08,675
They're trying to kill me!

391
00:25:08,775 --> 00:25:10,810
They already shot me five times.

392
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:11,611
Help me!

393
00:25:11,711 --> 00:25:12,579
Help me!

394
00:25:12,679 --> 00:25:13,846
Help me!

395
00:25:13,946 --> 00:25:15,281
FEMALE REPORTER: Good
evening, ladies and gentlemen.

396
00:25:15,381 --> 00:25:18,184
The top news story at this
hour... police and paramedics

397
00:25:18,284 --> 00:25:21,387
Were just called to the campus
of the now-defunct Spencer

398
00:25:21,487 --> 00:25:24,824
House College by Jim Flowers,
leader of the White Doves

399
00:25:24,924 --> 00:25:27,560
Of Peace, and a
probation officer

400
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:31,463
After they found paroled
mass murder Hubert Whitehead

401
00:25:31,564 --> 00:25:33,465
Screaming and
babbling about being

402
00:25:33,566 --> 00:25:36,903
Shot in the very room he
went on a shooting rampage

403
00:25:37,003 --> 00:25:38,938
22 years ago.

404
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:41,373
There were no signs
of shots being fired,

405
00:25:41,473 --> 00:25:43,776
Nor anyone being there,
except Whitehead.

406
00:25:58,758 --> 00:26:02,561
Good story, Jack, but
whatever happened to Hubert?

407
00:26:02,662 --> 00:26:06,298
Oh, he's locked up in
some padded cell someplace.

408
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:07,299
So let me get this straight.

409
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:09,501
Are you saying this
place has ghosts?

410
00:26:09,602 --> 00:26:12,038
Uh-huh.

411
00:26:12,138 --> 00:26:15,207
And then there was
the Davis family.

412
00:26:15,307 --> 00:26:17,877
Oh, that was quite a story.

413
00:26:17,977 --> 00:26:19,511
RUTHERFORD: Who?

414
00:26:19,612 --> 00:26:21,547
Oh, well, you don't
wanna hear about that one.

415
00:26:21,648 --> 00:26:24,116
RUTHERFORD: Well, why not, Jack?

416
00:26:24,216 --> 00:26:25,685
Because you
wouldn't believe it.

417
00:26:25,785 --> 00:26:26,953
Try me.

418
00:26:27,053 --> 00:26:28,888
Vampires.

419
00:26:28,988 --> 00:26:30,757
Vampires?

420
00:26:30,857 --> 00:26:31,658
Did I hear you right?

421
00:26:31,758 --> 00:26:32,458
Vampires.

422
00:26:45,104 --> 00:26:46,639
[Gunshot]

423
00:26:46,739 --> 00:26:47,439
Shit!

424
00:26:50,476 --> 00:26:51,577
Why don't you let me try?

425
00:26:51,678 --> 00:26:52,779
Because you'll never hit it.

426
00:26:52,879 --> 00:26:54,480
Yeah, only because
you won't let me try.

427
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:55,281
Shut up.

428
00:26:55,381 --> 00:26:56,315
JAMIE: I can hit it.

429
00:26:56,415 --> 00:26:57,717
Get outta here.
You're a girl.

430
00:26:57,817 --> 00:26:58,918
You can't shoot a gun.

431
00:26:59,018 --> 00:27:02,154
Just because I'm a girl
has nothing to do with it.

432
00:27:02,254 --> 00:27:03,155
All right, Jamie.

433
00:27:03,255 --> 00:27:03,956
What?

434
00:27:04,056 --> 00:27:05,257
Are you kidding me?

435
00:27:05,357 --> 00:27:06,258
No way, man.

436
00:27:06,358 --> 00:27:07,059
Uh-uh.

437
00:27:07,159 --> 00:27:08,728
I'm next.

438
00:27:08,828 --> 00:27:09,896
You know how to use this?

439
00:27:09,996 --> 00:27:10,697
I think so.

440
00:27:17,837 --> 00:27:18,570
TIM: OK.

441
00:27:18,671 --> 00:27:20,639
Prop this up on your shoulder.

442
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:23,409
Take off the safety,
and you're all set.

443
00:27:35,287 --> 00:27:36,488
Great shot, Jamie.

444
00:27:36,588 --> 00:27:40,793
TIM: Yeah, terrific shot, Jamie.

445
00:27:40,893 --> 00:27:41,593
Hi, Tim.

446
00:27:41,694 --> 00:27:43,395
Hi, Laurie.

447
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:44,196
Hi, Tim.

448
00:27:44,296 --> 00:27:45,297
Hi, Laurie.

449
00:27:45,397 --> 00:27:46,098
Yeah.

450
00:27:46,198 --> 00:27:47,700
You two make me sick.

451
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:48,534
Come on, Jamie.

452
00:27:48,634 --> 00:27:49,535
Let's see if we can get inside.

453
00:27:57,143 --> 00:27:57,844
Are you coming?

454
00:28:04,616 --> 00:28:06,518
It was as if Timmy
truly believed

455
00:28:06,618 --> 00:28:08,487
That '50s horror
film quote, "a family"

456
00:28:08,587 --> 00:28:16,662
That slays together
stays together."

457
00:28:16,763 --> 00:28:17,463
TOM: Are you coming?

458
00:28:26,005 --> 00:28:27,339
I'm going to check upstairs.

459
00:28:27,439 --> 00:28:29,675
Wait a minute!

460
00:28:29,776 --> 00:28:31,543
Tom!

461
00:28:31,643 --> 00:28:32,678
ADULT JAMIE
(VOICEOVER): What were

462
00:28:32,779 --> 00:28:35,014
We doing in that old
house, a place where we

463
00:28:35,114 --> 00:28:37,349
Played every summer for years?

464
00:28:37,449 --> 00:28:39,285
You didn't have to
be clairvoyant to see

465
00:28:39,385 --> 00:28:43,122
That our family was changing,
even though none of us

466
00:28:43,222 --> 00:28:44,590
Realized it at the time.

467
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:46,425
It was obvious that
Timmy, the oldest,

468
00:28:46,525 --> 00:28:49,796
Had discovered that I wasn't
the only girl in the world.

469
00:28:49,896 --> 00:28:52,765
The time had come for
him to begin thinking

470
00:28:52,865 --> 00:28:54,566
With another part
of his body, and he

471
00:28:54,666 --> 00:28:55,701
Wasn't thinking of me or Tommy.

472
00:29:03,242 --> 00:29:06,512
Tommy, tired of being in
his older brother's shadow,

473
00:29:06,612 --> 00:29:09,515
Was finding strength to
fight his way out of it.

474
00:29:09,615 --> 00:29:12,618
Unfortunately, he found most
of that strength battling

475
00:29:12,718 --> 00:29:13,986
My parents, his
teachers, and the police,

476
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:16,956
Not necessarily in that order.

477
00:29:17,056 --> 00:29:19,458
Sergeant Booker threatened
that one more prank,

478
00:29:19,558 --> 00:29:21,928
And he was going to
put Tommy away forever.

479
00:29:22,028 --> 00:29:23,930
My brother walked
right up to him

480
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:27,499
And said "you'll never take
me alive" with such conviction

481
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:30,469
That we almost believed him.

482
00:29:30,569 --> 00:29:35,942
I was just becoming aware of
my gift, my gift of sight.

483
00:29:36,042 --> 00:29:39,411
Down the hall... it
called me down the hall.

484
00:29:39,511 --> 00:29:43,883
I could see things, things
without them being there.

485
00:29:43,983 --> 00:29:45,784
Sometimes I'd see things
happening at the same time

486
00:29:45,885 --> 00:29:48,354
In another part of town.

487
00:29:48,454 --> 00:29:51,323
Other times, I felt that I
could almost see the future,

488
00:29:51,423 --> 00:29:53,792
But I never got the
full picture, only

489
00:29:53,893 --> 00:29:56,262
Pieces... pieces of the whole.

490
00:29:56,362 --> 00:29:58,764
They'd come in flashes.

491
00:29:58,865 --> 00:30:01,733
Sometimes, they'd
come in dreams.

492
00:30:01,834 --> 00:30:03,235
If I told my brothers
about the gift,

493
00:30:03,335 --> 00:30:06,205
They would have said that
I only had pieces of brain,

494
00:30:06,305 --> 00:30:08,774
May have convinced
Sergeant Booker that I was

495
00:30:08,875 --> 00:30:09,876
The one to be put away forever.

496
00:30:09,976 --> 00:30:14,246
So I kept quiet, but
the piece that flashed

497
00:30:14,346 --> 00:30:16,215
Before me now was a book.

498
00:30:16,315 --> 00:30:18,684
There's a book in the cellar.

499
00:30:18,784 --> 00:30:21,653
Down the cellar
stairs... find it.

500
00:30:21,753 --> 00:30:22,654
It's there.

501
00:30:22,754 --> 00:30:25,091
Part of me said
run, even as I began

502
00:30:25,191 --> 00:30:29,528
This twisted descent down.

503
00:30:29,628 --> 00:30:30,529
Did I see those things?

504
00:30:38,604 --> 00:30:39,405
What was really calling me?

505
00:30:51,383 --> 00:30:52,251
A comic book?

506
00:30:55,321 --> 00:30:57,589
A simple comic book whose
subject would cause our

507
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:59,691
Lives to change wildly
out of control forever.

508
00:31:02,794 --> 00:31:05,264
WOMAN: Jamie!

509
00:31:05,364 --> 00:31:07,766
Who's there?

510
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:09,068
Help me!

511
00:31:09,168 --> 00:31:11,503
My ankle is sprained.

512
00:31:11,603 --> 00:31:14,473
I can't make it up the stairs.

513
00:31:14,573 --> 00:31:18,911
Step into the light
so I can see you.

514
00:31:19,011 --> 00:31:20,379
I can't move.

515
00:31:20,479 --> 00:31:22,081
Please help me.

516
00:31:22,181 --> 00:31:24,050
I don't believe you.

517
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:26,052
You're afraid of the
light, aren't you?

518
00:31:31,123 --> 00:31:32,992
WOMAN: I told you to come here!

519
00:31:50,977 --> 00:31:51,877
Tim, stop it!

520
00:31:51,978 --> 00:31:53,545
What's the matter?

521
00:31:53,645 --> 00:31:54,813
It's getting late.

522
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:55,781
I have to go.

523
00:31:55,881 --> 00:31:56,915
- Oh, come on.
- No!

524
00:31:57,016 --> 00:31:57,716
[Laughter]

525
00:31:57,816 --> 00:31:59,685
Not that late.

526
00:31:59,785 --> 00:32:01,287
OK!
OK, OK.

527
00:32:01,387 --> 00:32:02,588
All right.

528
00:32:02,688 --> 00:32:05,191
I'll come back later when
my parents have gone to bed,

529
00:32:05,291 --> 00:32:06,192
At midnight.

530
00:32:06,292 --> 00:32:08,927
Oh, you mean a,
uh, midnight dinner?

531
00:32:19,505 --> 00:32:21,140
ADULT JAMIE (VOICEOVER):
It was a summer of sneaking

532
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:21,940
Out the bedroom window.

533
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,383
Timmy's teenage desires
required something other

534
00:32:31,483 --> 00:32:33,852
Than a good night's sleep.

535
00:32:37,456 --> 00:32:40,359
It was a case of the
hot-to-trots gone mad.

536
00:32:44,463 --> 00:32:47,499
Unfortunately, midnight
passion needs a bit more

537
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:49,335
Than a flat beer
in a tall boy can

538
00:32:49,435 --> 00:32:51,337
And a stand-up
date's empty promise.

539
00:32:55,507 --> 00:32:57,043
His lust turned to anger.

540
00:33:04,616 --> 00:33:13,492
Then, he saw her dancing,
dancing to some unheard

541
00:33:13,592 --> 00:33:15,927
Music for his audience of one.

542
00:33:16,028 --> 00:33:18,930
Her slow, sultry
movements perfectly match

543
00:33:19,031 --> 00:33:20,899
His internal pubescent rhythms.

544
00:33:28,474 --> 00:33:31,877
Strong, pulsating,
desiring... his body

545
00:33:31,977 --> 00:33:36,348
Wanted her more than his
teenage mind could understand.

546
00:33:36,448 --> 00:33:38,850
In seconds, she
became the object

547
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:41,820
Of his every desire,
the perfect woman

548
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:44,823
To ignite the hot loins
of his youthful passion.

549
00:33:44,923 --> 00:33:49,795
She was the midnight date
of his darkest dream.

550
00:33:49,895 --> 00:33:53,265
His eyes drank in her every
curve, her every move,

551
00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:54,266
Her every motion.

552
00:33:59,838 --> 00:34:03,475
Her slow, undulating sexuality
sent ripples of desire

553
00:34:03,575 --> 00:34:04,276
Throughout him.

554
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:14,886
With every surge of her
body, he felt closer to her.

555
00:34:14,986 --> 00:34:17,356
He wanted to be deep
inside her, sharing

556
00:34:17,456 --> 00:34:18,724
Her pleasure and ecstasy.

557
00:34:22,294 --> 00:34:25,264
Her slow, sensuous
rocking seemed

558
00:34:25,364 --> 00:34:28,200
Like ritualistic foreplay,
a pagan dance of desire

559
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:30,769
That she was using to
prepare herself for him.

560
00:34:38,544 --> 00:34:39,745
He knew.

561
00:34:39,845 --> 00:34:43,615
He knew that she wanted him
as much as he wanted her.

562
00:34:43,715 --> 00:34:46,485
Not knowing exactly
what to do, but knowing

563
00:34:46,585 --> 00:34:49,588
Exactly what he wanted, he
followed her down the hall.

564
00:34:52,458 --> 00:34:54,760
Questions like
who was this woman

565
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:56,495
And what was she
doing in this house

566
00:34:56,595 --> 00:34:59,198
Never entered his mind
as he followed her scent.

567
00:35:03,068 --> 00:35:06,438
[Music playing]

568
00:35:22,321 --> 00:35:25,224
He was entering the
domain of sweating,

569
00:35:25,324 --> 00:35:29,695
Moving, open-mouthed bodies
filled with sexual desires that

570
00:35:29,795 --> 00:35:31,697
Could only be
fulfilled by reaching

571
00:35:31,797 --> 00:35:36,668
A screaming mutual climax that
left no one wanting for more.

572
00:35:36,768 --> 00:35:39,938
He was about to become a man.

573
00:35:40,038 --> 00:35:41,907
Hello.

574
00:35:42,007 --> 00:35:42,774
I'm Diane.

575
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,216
I've been watching you.

576
00:35:52,784 --> 00:35:53,485
Why?

577
00:35:57,556 --> 00:36:00,759
Yes, that's right.

578
00:36:00,859 --> 00:36:01,660
You know why.

579
00:36:07,065 --> 00:36:08,300
I can't do this.

580
00:36:13,205 --> 00:36:19,110
This is what you
want, isn't it?

ADULT JAMIE
(VOICEOVER): Suddenly, I

582
00:36:20,412 --> 00:36:22,548
Could actually sense
the quick, pulsing speed

583
00:36:22,648 --> 00:36:24,015
Of his beating heart.

584
00:36:24,115 --> 00:36:26,485
The gift swept me into the room.

585
00:36:26,585 --> 00:36:30,989
I could clearly see
my brother's face.

586
00:36:31,089 --> 00:36:34,793
[Screaming]

587
00:36:37,929 --> 00:36:38,630
All right, kid.

588
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:39,665
Where's your brother?

589
00:36:39,765 --> 00:36:40,732
I told you already.

590
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:42,067
I don't know where he is.

591
00:36:42,167 --> 00:36:43,935
I ran all you punks off from
the Spencer House yesterday.

592
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:44,903
Tom was with you.

593
00:36:45,003 --> 00:36:45,837
What happened to him?

594
00:36:45,937 --> 00:36:46,938
I don't know what
happened to him.

595
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:48,173
Did he go back
there to meet Lauren?

596
00:36:48,274 --> 00:36:48,974
I have no idea.

597
00:36:49,074 --> 00:36:49,775
I don't know.

598
00:36:54,012 --> 00:36:57,616
MR. DAVIS: He's... he's
really quite an athlete.

599
00:36:57,716 --> 00:36:58,884
CAROL: He's got a
lot of friends too.

600
00:36:58,984 --> 00:37:01,653
I can't imagine he'd
have any enemies at all.

[Crying]

602
00:37:04,189 --> 00:37:07,959
Did you hit or
beat Tim recently?

603
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:10,396
Why don't you just go find him?

604
00:37:10,496 --> 00:37:12,831
Carol, he's just
trying to do his job.

605
00:37:15,867 --> 00:37:18,270
Have you noticed any
changes, any changes at all,

606
00:37:18,370 --> 00:37:19,805
In his behavior?

607
00:37:19,905 --> 00:37:21,206
What are you talking about?

608
00:37:21,307 --> 00:37:22,374
Drugs?

609
00:37:22,474 --> 00:37:24,276
For Christ's sake, haven't
you been listening?

610
00:37:24,376 --> 00:37:26,077
Why don't you cut this
bullshit interrogation

611
00:37:26,177 --> 00:37:27,212
And go out and find out son?

612
00:37:30,215 --> 00:37:31,583
What's going on?

613
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,187
Tim's been gone all night.

614
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:42,628
OFFICER: Jamie, did
your brother say

615
00:37:42,728 --> 00:37:45,664
Anything, anything at all, that
might help us know where he is?

616
00:37:50,135 --> 00:37:52,904
JAMIE: (SCREAMING) The lady in
the old Spencer House has him!

617
00:37:53,004 --> 00:37:53,839
OFFICER: Calm down.

618
00:37:53,939 --> 00:37:55,407
Now, Jamie, tell
us what happened.

619
00:38:01,012 --> 00:38:04,182
Well, this woman is
staying at the house,

620
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:06,117
And Tim went over
there last night.

621
00:38:06,217 --> 00:38:08,720
They started kissing,
and Tim couldn't see what

622
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:10,322
She really is, and she bit him!

623
00:38:10,422 --> 00:38:11,122
Oh, come on.

624
00:38:11,222 --> 00:38:13,792
She bit him?

625
00:38:13,892 --> 00:38:18,229
OFFICER: Jamie, how do
you know she bit him?

626
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:21,533
I saw it happen in a dream.

627
00:38:21,633 --> 00:38:24,803
What do you mean,
you saw it in a dream?

628
00:38:24,903 --> 00:38:28,374
How can you be so
cruel to your mother?

629
00:38:28,474 --> 00:38:32,844
Your brother is missing, and all
you can tell about is a dream?

630
00:38:32,944 --> 00:38:33,645
But Mom...

631
00:38:33,745 --> 00:38:34,613
That's enough, young lady.

632
00:38:34,713 --> 00:38:36,582
Dad, you have to believe me.

633
00:38:36,682 --> 00:38:37,916
I saw her yesterday.

634
00:38:38,016 --> 00:38:40,185
I know she has him
down in the basement.

635
00:38:40,285 --> 00:38:41,186
Go to your room.

636
00:38:41,286 --> 00:38:42,153
It's true!

637
00:38:45,624 --> 00:38:46,958
Go check on your sister.

638
00:38:54,966 --> 00:38:56,368
Stewart, this is Unit 32.

639
00:38:56,468 --> 00:38:59,004
We're 1097 at Spencer House.

00:38:59,104 --> 00:39:00,472
Boy, look at this dump.

641
00:39:00,572 --> 00:39:01,473
Gosh.

642
00:39:01,573 --> 00:39:03,008
I don't know why
these kids play here.

643
00:39:03,108 --> 00:39:04,075
Who knows?

644
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:07,379
We'll find out, though.

645

Boy.

646
00:39:09,314 --> 00:39:11,149
I guess I'll go around back.

647
00:39:11,249 --> 00:39:12,784
I'll check the place out.

648
00:39:12,884 --> 00:39:15,487

649
00:39:15,587 --> 00:39:17,656
It's the only lead I have.

00:39:17,756 --> 00:39:18,657
All right with me.

00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:32,931
Nothing.

00:40:33,031 --> 00:40:33,932

And reported seeing
nothing, we knew

00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:13,605
Than that if we wanted
to find our brother,

657
00:41:13,705 --> 00:41:15,507
We would have to
do it ourselves.

I don't know.

I mean, this sounds crazy,
but I've seen her in a dream.

661
00:41:39,397 --> 00:41:41,032
She wasn't biting my neck.

I don't know.

678
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:22,520
Maybe we should call the cops.

679
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:24,289
They wouldn't believe us.

680
00:45:24,389 --> 00:45:25,690
What do you mean,
they won't believe us?

681

00:48:56,267 --> 00:48:57,268
OFFICER: We need backup!

728
00:48:57,368 --> 00:49:00,538
We need backup now!

729
00:49:00,638 --> 00:49:03,274
[Screaming]

730
00:49:03,374 --> 00:49:04,442
TOM: Get your hands
off my sister!

731
00:49:04,542 --> 00:49:05,643
I fucking mean it!
[gunshot]

732
00:49:05,743 --> 00:49:06,777
He's got a gun!
[gunshot]

733
00:49:06,877 --> 00:49:07,578
Freeze!

734
00:49:07,678 --> 00:49:08,846
[Gunshot]

735
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:09,647
Tom!

736
00:49:15,386 --> 00:49:17,522
We all died that night.

737
00:49:17,622 --> 00:49:22,827
If I close my eyes, I can still
see them... smiling, happy,

738
00:49:22,927 --> 00:49:27,165
Teasing... a true loving family.

739
00:49:27,265 --> 00:49:29,700
But eventually, you
have to open your eyes

740
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:32,270
And face the bright
light of reality.

741
00:49:32,370 --> 00:49:34,739
Mom and Dad never recovered.

742
00:49:34,839 --> 00:49:38,176
They simply lost the
desire to survive,

743
00:49:38,276 --> 00:49:40,645
And they were right, for
they had nothing to live for.

744
00:49:45,316 --> 00:49:48,286
As the years passed,
my gift grew stronger.

745
00:49:48,386 --> 00:49:51,089
The more powerful it became,
the deeper within myself

746
00:49:51,189 --> 00:49:56,327
I hid, until I walled myself
away into my own little world.

747
00:49:56,427 --> 00:49:59,264
But I closed my mind to
the reality of my vision,

748
00:49:59,364 --> 00:50:02,500
Refusing to act upon what I saw.

749
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:04,569
My gift made my see.

750
00:50:04,669 --> 00:50:08,139
The more I denied it,
the stronger my vision.

751
00:50:08,239 --> 00:50:10,641
It was in front of
me day and night,

752
00:50:10,741 --> 00:50:14,412
Gnawing, consuming, destroying.

753
00:50:14,512 --> 00:50:16,013
I could deny it no longer.

754
00:50:16,114 --> 00:50:18,015
Our fates were sealed.

755
00:50:18,116 --> 00:50:20,985
Now all we had to do
was play our parts.

756
00:50:21,086 --> 00:50:25,456
Mine required all the strength
I could possibly muster.

757
00:50:25,556 --> 00:50:28,059
But the gift... my
gift from hell...

758
00:50:28,159 --> 00:50:29,194
Had to reach its final end.

759
00:50:40,338 --> 00:50:42,073
I have something for you.

760
00:50:48,979 --> 00:50:52,350
[Screaming]

761
00:51:12,837 --> 00:51:14,105
ADULT JAMIE (VOICEOVER):
Timmy was right.

762
00:51:14,205 --> 00:51:17,342
A family that slays
together stays together.

763
00:51:21,612 --> 00:51:22,313
Shit.

764
00:51:22,413 --> 00:51:23,114
You're crazy.

765
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:34,492
Is that it?

766
00:51:34,592 --> 00:51:38,529
No, that ain't it.

767
00:51:38,629 --> 00:51:43,201
This place was recently
called Gabriel Manor.

768
00:51:43,301 --> 00:51:44,935
Yeah, that's right.

769
00:51:47,638 --> 00:51:48,806
But wasn't he that
doctor with all

770
00:51:48,906 --> 00:51:50,241
Those Harvard
Medical School awards

771
00:51:50,341 --> 00:51:51,809
That... that went
off the deep end?

772
00:51:51,909 --> 00:51:55,246
Oh, there's a lot more
to the story than that.

773
00:51:55,346 --> 00:51:56,314
I knew you were gonna say that.

774
00:52:01,986 --> 00:52:09,560
Creatures of light, spirits
of fairy, join me tonight.

775
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:13,498
I reach to the air,
oh, goddess, so fair.

776
00:52:24,108 --> 00:52:32,250
Darksome night and shining
moon, east, then south,

777
00:52:32,350 --> 00:52:36,254
Then west, then north.

778
00:52:36,354 --> 00:52:40,691
Harden to the witch's room.

779
00:52:40,791 --> 00:52:43,661
Here I come to call ye forth.

780
00:52:46,664 --> 00:52:50,535
I conspire thee, oh circle
of power, that thou blessed

781
00:52:50,635 --> 00:52:59,444
A meeting place of love, joy,
and truth, a shield against all

782
00:52:59,544 --> 00:53:03,314
That is harmful and
wicked, a boundary

783
00:53:03,414 --> 00:53:12,022
Between the mortal world and
the realms of the mighty ones.

784
00:53:12,122 --> 00:53:17,795
May the goddess send you
through the grass for blade.

785
00:53:17,895 --> 00:53:21,266
And as I wish, let
the spell be made!

786
00:53:24,802 --> 00:53:28,105
[Screaming]

787
00:53:31,509 --> 00:53:32,209
All right.

788
00:53:32,310 --> 00:53:34,879
This guy was a doper.

789
00:53:34,979 --> 00:53:36,981
He's probably got a stash.

790
00:53:37,081 --> 00:53:38,449
Let's find it.
OK.

791
00:53:38,549 --> 00:53:39,250
You got it, chief.

792
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:49,126
He thinks this guy
has some stash.

793
00:53:49,226 --> 00:53:49,927
Let's look around.

794
00:53:50,027 --> 00:53:50,728
You got it.

795
00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:21,459
Frank.

796
00:54:21,559 --> 00:54:22,259
Hi, Miss Peters.

797
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:23,060
Hi, boys.

798
00:54:37,141 --> 00:54:38,676
I guess he thought I
was closing in on him.

799
00:54:38,776 --> 00:54:40,144
He couldn't take the pressure.

800
00:54:40,244 --> 00:54:42,347
Heh, poor son of a
bitch hung himself.

801
00:54:42,447 --> 00:54:45,616
[Chuckling]

802
00:54:48,085 --> 00:54:49,854
Oh, hiya, Jessie.

803
00:54:49,954 --> 00:54:50,655
Hi, Eddie.

804
00:54:56,427 --> 00:54:58,429
Um, let... let me
get back to you here.

805
00:55:11,576 --> 00:55:14,345
Jess, I got something
to show you.

806
00:55:18,816 --> 00:55:22,186
Well, Jim, looks
like you got your man.

807
00:55:22,286 --> 00:55:24,121
I couldn't have
done it without you.

808
00:55:24,221 --> 00:55:25,923
Don't sell yourself short.

809
00:55:26,023 --> 00:55:27,625
Well, let's face it.

810
00:55:27,725 --> 00:55:30,461
Whenever I call you in on
a case, all I have to do

811
00:55:30,561 --> 00:55:32,963
Is sit back and
wait for the corpse.

812
00:55:33,063 --> 00:55:34,064
[Chuckling]

813
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:34,865
OFFICER: Chief!

814
00:55:34,965 --> 00:55:37,167
Telephone!

815
00:55:37,267 --> 00:55:40,104
Oh, hey, so what do I do now?

816
00:55:40,204 --> 00:55:43,307
Consider yourself on vacation.

817
00:55:43,408 --> 00:55:47,344
This is, until the
next psycho turns up.

818
00:55:47,445 --> 00:55:50,748
[Music playing]

819
00:56:03,528 --> 00:56:04,228
Come on, bitch.

820
00:56:16,607 --> 00:56:18,476
Hi, baby!

821
00:56:18,576 --> 00:56:19,477
Hi!

822
00:56:19,577 --> 00:56:20,478
I got something for ya.

823
00:56:27,585 --> 00:56:30,955
[Screaming]

824
00:57:51,602 --> 00:57:52,302
Here we go.

825
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:30,240
[Music playing]

826
00:58:46,924 --> 00:58:49,259
Carefully, carefully!

827
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:50,761
Not to worry, my dear.

828
00:58:50,861 --> 00:58:51,729
No harm done.

829
00:58:51,829 --> 00:58:53,230
I'm sorry, doctor.

830
00:58:53,330 --> 00:58:56,701
I'll get somebody to... hi, Nico.

831
00:58:56,801 --> 00:59:00,270
Well, my boy, was it
a successful operation?

832
00:59:08,245 --> 00:59:15,552
I got what you wanted, if,
uh, this is what you mean.

833
00:59:15,653 --> 00:59:18,889
DOCTOR: You were careful to
make a neat and clean incision,

834
00:59:18,989 --> 00:59:19,690
I hope.

835
00:59:26,063 --> 00:59:36,306
After all, these are patients,
and we must take due care.

836
00:59:44,514 --> 00:59:45,582
Yeah, doc.

837
00:59:45,683 --> 00:59:48,786
I was real clean and neat.

838
00:59:48,886 --> 00:59:49,854
The envelope, please?

839
01:00:00,998 --> 01:00:06,036
You know, doc, I like being
in the medical profession.

840
01:00:06,136 --> 01:00:07,905
It's, uh, very rewarding.

841
01:00:08,005 --> 01:00:11,742
Here is your next
patient, doctor.

842
01:00:11,842 --> 01:00:13,210
How soon must we operate?

843
01:00:13,310 --> 01:00:15,012
Why, immediately.

844
01:00:15,112 --> 01:00:16,914
Good.

845
01:00:17,014 --> 01:00:17,882
MISS TESSBALL: Bye, Nico.

846
01:00:17,982 --> 01:00:20,417
DOCTOR: Miss Tessball, please.

847
01:00:20,517 --> 01:00:21,318
MISS TESSBALL: Yes, doctor.

848
01:00:29,159 --> 01:00:30,761
WOMAN: What do you mean,
you can't find my dog?

849
01:00:30,861 --> 01:00:33,698
My Muffin is the cutest
dog in the country.

850
01:00:33,798 --> 01:00:35,265
What's the matter with
you people, that you

851
01:00:35,365 --> 01:00:37,501
Can't find one little dog?

852
01:00:37,601 --> 01:00:40,137
My tax dollars pay your
salary, and for that matter,

853
01:00:40,237 --> 01:00:42,907
Probably the braces on your
kids' teeth and your car

854
01:00:43,007 --> 01:00:44,508
Parked out there
in the parking lot.

855
01:00:44,608 --> 01:00:45,475
Now get off your butt
and go find my Muffin!

856
01:00:45,575 --> 01:00:46,576
Hi, Jess.

857
01:00:46,677 --> 01:00:47,377
Look what the chief
got me for my birthday.

858
01:00:47,477 --> 01:00:48,312
Hi, Eddie.

859
01:00:48,412 --> 01:00:49,246
Hey, guys, wait up!

860
01:00:49,346 --> 01:00:50,514
I gotta show you this.

861
01:00:50,614 --> 01:00:51,749
Jess, I'm glad you're here.

862
01:00:51,849 --> 01:00:53,017
Well, I got your message.

863
01:00:53,117 --> 01:00:55,519
Oh, how was your vacation?

864
01:00:55,619 --> 01:00:57,922
Short.

865
01:00:58,022 --> 01:01:01,692
Jessica Peters, I'd like you
meet Special Agent Thurber

866
01:01:01,792 --> 01:01:02,893
And Special Agent McGee.

867
01:01:02,993 --> 01:01:03,828
Pleasure.

868
01:01:03,928 --> 01:01:05,395
Jess is on a
special task force.

869
01:01:05,495 --> 01:01:07,264
These gentleman are
with the Bureau.

870
01:01:07,364 --> 01:01:08,833
MAN: [shout] Pick up the phone!

871
01:01:08,933 --> 01:01:10,267
Thank you.

872
01:01:10,367 --> 01:01:12,036
Take a look at these.

873
01:01:12,136 --> 01:01:13,303
When did this happen?

874
01:01:13,403 --> 01:01:14,204
OFFICER: Earlier today.

875
01:01:21,345 --> 01:01:22,579
Any leads?

876
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:26,083
Well, it's the fourth one
this week, so needless to say,

877
01:01:26,183 --> 01:01:28,352
We're not very happy about it.

878
01:01:28,452 --> 01:01:29,820
Any pattern?

879
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:32,656
Yeah, well, that's
where it gets strange.

880
01:01:32,757 --> 01:01:36,326
Seems our man is very
precise in his work.

881
01:01:36,426 --> 01:01:39,496
He kills his victims
by strangulation.

882
01:01:39,596 --> 01:01:41,498
We think he uses a piano wire.

883
01:01:41,598 --> 01:01:46,837
He then very meticulously
extracts a body organ

884
01:01:46,937 --> 01:01:49,239
And takes it with him.

885
01:01:49,339 --> 01:01:51,375
Do we know why?

886
01:01:51,475 --> 01:01:54,378
Well, these gentlemen
think they know.

887
01:01:54,478 --> 01:01:57,681
I'll let Agent Thurber
take it from here.

888
01:01:57,782 --> 01:02:00,650
Are you familiar with
a doctor Henry Gabriel?

889
01:02:00,751 --> 01:02:02,452
Oh, yes, yes, I know who he is.

890
01:02:02,552 --> 01:02:04,922
I know it is said that
he's one of the best

891
01:02:05,022 --> 01:02:06,857
In the country in his field.

892
01:02:06,957 --> 01:02:11,261
Well, he is also
one of the strangest.

893
01:02:11,361 --> 01:02:13,297
Our office received
reports several weeks ago

894
01:02:13,397 --> 01:02:18,535
That one of the corpses used in
the pre-med classes was stolen.

895
01:02:18,635 --> 01:02:21,605
The hospital wrote it
off as some fraternity

896
01:02:21,705 --> 01:02:25,209
Playing the usual college prank.

897
01:02:25,309 --> 01:02:27,244
We decided to investigate.

898
01:02:27,344 --> 01:02:29,479
Through our
investigation, we also

899
01:02:29,579 --> 01:02:32,649
Found that a great
deal of various tissue

900
01:02:32,749 --> 01:02:36,486
And organ life support equipment
had also turned up missing.

901
01:02:36,586 --> 01:02:38,088
Well, how does this
involve Dr. Gabriel?

902
01:02:42,426 --> 01:02:45,695
A good number of students
spoke frankly with us.

903
01:02:45,796 --> 01:02:47,764
The general feeling
was that Dr. Gabriel

904
01:02:47,865 --> 01:02:50,067
Was somehow behind all of this.

905
01:02:50,167 --> 01:02:52,369
He often expressed the
medical possibilities

906
01:02:52,469 --> 01:02:56,941
Of keeping separate
organs alive,

907
01:02:57,041 --> 01:02:58,843
Assembling them
into one body shell,

908
01:02:58,943 --> 01:03:01,245
And giving them unified life.

909
01:03:01,345 --> 01:03:03,914
Why could he possibly
want to do this?

910
01:03:04,014 --> 01:03:07,184
Well, it would appear that
our good doctor is immensely

911
01:03:07,284 --> 01:03:10,554
Paranoid of the AIDS virus.

912
01:03:10,654 --> 01:03:12,589
JESS: Let me see if I can guess.

913
01:03:12,689 --> 01:03:14,591
He wants to assemble
his own little playmate

914
01:03:14,691 --> 01:03:17,061
So he can remain safe.

915
01:03:17,161 --> 01:03:18,128
But wait a minute.

916
01:03:18,228 --> 01:03:20,264
How does he know that
the parts he using

917
01:03:20,364 --> 01:03:23,000
Aren't from women with AIDS?

918
01:03:23,100 --> 01:03:25,069
Good question.

919
01:03:25,169 --> 01:03:29,473
It would seem, coincidentally
or uncoincidentally,

920
01:03:29,573 --> 01:03:32,276
That all the victims so
far were recent patients

921
01:03:32,376 --> 01:03:33,377
Of the hospital.

922
01:03:33,477 --> 01:03:35,079
Therefore, their
blood had been tested

923
01:03:35,179 --> 01:03:39,183
And was on record for any
of the staff to check.

924
01:03:39,283 --> 01:03:40,184
Wait a minute.

925
01:03:40,284 --> 01:03:42,252
This man is a
doctor, not a killer.

926
01:03:42,352 --> 01:03:44,021
So how is it that
he's able to perform

927
01:03:44,121 --> 01:03:47,124
These murders so efficiently
and without a trace?

928
01:03:47,224 --> 01:03:50,560
We thought of that, so we did a
complete sweep of all the crime

929
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:52,930
Scenes thus far,
and on one of them,

930
01:03:53,030 --> 01:03:55,065
There were some strange prints.

931
01:03:55,165 --> 01:03:59,603
When we ran them, we came
up with those of this man.

932
01:03:59,703 --> 01:04:02,472
His name is Nico
Moretti, one of the best

933
01:04:02,572 --> 01:04:04,108
Hired hands in the country.

934
01:04:04,208 --> 01:04:07,211
JESS: Well, why don't you just
bring him in for questioning?

935
01:04:07,311 --> 01:04:08,845
If only it were that easy.

936
01:04:08,946 --> 01:04:12,416
Lovely Nico's been untouchable
for almost 10 years now.

937
01:04:12,516 --> 01:04:16,320
He travels under assumed
names and phony passports.

938
01:04:16,420 --> 01:04:18,956
We may have a lead on this guy.

939
01:04:19,056 --> 01:04:20,557
It seems we've had
several complaints

940
01:04:20,657 --> 01:04:27,998
Of a loud motorcycle coming
and going from Gabriel Manor.

941
01:04:28,098 --> 01:04:31,235
JESS: So you think that Dr.
Gabriel has retained this, uh,

942
01:04:31,335 --> 01:04:34,571
Nico's services for
his new project?

943
01:04:34,671 --> 01:04:37,207
Excuse my ignorance here,
but, uh, why not bring

944
01:04:37,307 --> 01:04:40,177
In Dr. Gabriel for questioning?

945
01:04:40,277 --> 01:04:44,414
Dr. Gabriel is a
pillar of society.

946
01:04:44,514 --> 01:04:46,450
This evidence,
however revealing,

947
01:04:46,550 --> 01:04:48,785
Is merely circumstantial.

948
01:04:48,885 --> 01:04:52,189
His lawyers would never allow
us to get anywhere near him.

949
01:04:52,289 --> 01:04:56,093
Unfortunately, even the
law has its limitations.

950
01:04:56,193 --> 01:05:00,864
So Jess, you can
see why we need you.

951
01:05:00,965 --> 01:05:03,567
What is your part of
the special task force?

952
01:05:03,667 --> 01:05:07,537
Uh, let's just say that Jess
has a way of, uh, cutting

953
01:05:07,637 --> 01:05:09,306
Through the red
tape of bureaucracy.

954
01:05:12,276 --> 01:05:14,011
AGENT THURBER: Well,
however you do it,

955
01:05:14,111 --> 01:05:16,646
I hope you catch
this wacko soon.

956
01:05:16,746 --> 01:05:22,619
For all we know, this clown
could be at it as we speak.

957
01:06:02,359 --> 01:06:03,027
Shit!

958
01:06:11,335 --> 01:06:12,036
Fuck!

959
01:06:28,085 --> 01:06:29,986
Oh, my God!

960
01:06:30,087 --> 01:06:31,988
Aw, shit!

961
01:06:32,089 --> 01:06:32,989
Son of a bitch!

962
01:06:45,069 --> 01:06:46,470
[Screaming]

963
01:06:46,570 --> 01:06:47,937
Bitch!

964
01:06:48,038 --> 01:06:49,106
You bitch!

965
01:06:49,206 --> 01:06:52,376
Nobody cuts Nico Moretti!

966
01:06:52,476 --> 01:06:53,343
Bitch!

967
01:06:53,443 --> 01:06:54,144
Oh!

968
01:07:25,842 --> 01:07:27,411
Oh.

969
01:07:27,511 --> 01:07:28,212
God.

970
01:09:17,887 --> 01:09:20,257
Wouldn't you rather
play nice than fight?

971
01:09:27,864 --> 01:09:31,235
[Phone ringing]

972
01:09:34,037 --> 01:09:34,738
Hello?

973
01:09:38,608 --> 01:09:40,944
I'll be right there.

974
01:09:41,044 --> 01:09:43,913
[Groaning]

975
01:09:50,954 --> 01:09:51,821
I got something here.

976
01:09:51,921 --> 01:09:52,689
OFFICER: Get a line on it.

977
01:09:52,789 --> 01:09:54,791
Drag it in, but take it easy.

978
01:09:54,891 --> 01:09:58,262
Yeah, put the coroner on
standby and give her out 20.

979
01:10:24,554 --> 01:10:25,289
[Screaming]

980
01:10:25,389 --> 01:10:26,290
It's OK.

981
01:10:26,390 --> 01:10:28,292
Calm down.

982
01:10:28,392 --> 01:10:29,793
JESS: Can I get through, please?

983
01:10:29,893 --> 01:10:31,295
Excuse me.

984
01:10:31,395 --> 01:10:32,296
OFFICER: All right.

985
01:10:32,396 --> 01:10:33,096
OK.

986
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:37,334
Excuse me.

987
01:10:37,434 --> 01:10:38,702
Yeah.

988
01:10:38,802 --> 01:10:39,703
Yeah, OK.

989
01:10:44,741 --> 01:10:46,142
When did this happen?

990
01:10:46,242 --> 01:10:49,913
Uh, a couple hours ago, as
far as we can figure out.

991
01:10:50,013 --> 01:10:51,648
We got a couple of
calls from neighbors

992
01:10:51,748 --> 01:10:53,683
Reporting screams and a
commotion out here at the lake.

993
01:11:01,625 --> 01:11:03,226
What was the
victim's first name?

994
01:11:03,327 --> 01:11:04,661
Sherry.

995
01:11:04,761 --> 01:11:07,564
And how long did you know her?

996
01:11:07,664 --> 01:11:08,432
All my life.

997
01:11:16,773 --> 01:11:18,508
Would you mind sitting down
for just a minute, please?

998
01:11:23,146 --> 01:11:26,115
Chief, I've got a neighbor
here that was able to make

999
01:11:26,215 --> 01:11:27,317
A positive ID of the victim.

1000
01:11:27,417 --> 01:11:28,452
Great work.

1001
01:11:28,552 --> 01:11:30,186
Do me a favor and give
her a ride home for me.

1002
01:11:30,286 --> 01:11:31,655
Thanks.

1003
01:11:31,755 --> 01:11:33,122
Yeah, right, chief.

1004
01:11:37,093 --> 01:11:39,128
Jess, I need to talk to
you for a minute over here.

1005
01:11:39,228 --> 01:11:39,929
Excuse us.

1006
01:11:44,033 --> 01:11:46,269
I just got off the phone
with some of the boys.

1007
01:11:46,370 --> 01:11:48,538
They're over at this
girl's house now.

1008
01:11:48,638 --> 01:11:51,675
They said the place is a
wreck... tables knocked over,

1009
01:11:51,775 --> 01:11:52,909
Blood all over the
girl's bedroom.

1010
01:11:57,213 --> 01:12:00,550
Why would he change his MO?

1011
01:12:00,650 --> 01:12:02,719
I mean, why dispose
of this body?

1012
01:12:02,819 --> 01:12:04,854
He didn't with
any of the others?

1013
01:12:04,954 --> 01:12:07,123
I've been asking myself
that same question.

1014
01:12:07,223 --> 01:12:09,292
The only thing I
can think of is,

1015
01:12:09,393 --> 01:12:11,495
All the others were
so clean and neat,

1016
01:12:11,595 --> 01:12:14,498
And then this one got messy.

1017
01:12:14,598 --> 01:12:16,633
Maybe he just didn't wanna
upset the good doctor.

1018
01:12:16,733 --> 01:12:18,001
Look, I'm going
to need the blood

1019
01:12:18,101 --> 01:12:21,070
From underneath her fingernails
and anything else of his you

1020
01:12:21,170 --> 01:12:22,506
Can get off of her.

1021
01:12:22,606 --> 01:12:23,407
You got it.

1022
01:12:23,507 --> 01:12:24,541
Great.

1023
01:12:24,641 --> 01:12:27,110
Um, listen, when do you
think we might expect

1024
01:12:27,210 --> 01:12:30,647
To retrieve our evasive psycho?

1025
01:12:30,747 --> 01:12:33,282
I'm going to see
someone right now that I

1026
01:12:33,383 --> 01:12:35,419
Think will be able to help.

1027
01:12:35,519 --> 01:12:37,020
Got it.

1028
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:37,821
I hope so.

1029
01:12:42,759 --> 01:12:44,994
Be careful.

1030
01:12:45,094 --> 01:12:47,363
I'm getting kinda used
to having you around.

1031
01:12:47,464 --> 01:12:49,065
[Inaudible].

1032
01:12:49,165 --> 01:12:51,635
After all, I am a
witch, remember?

1033
01:12:51,735 --> 01:12:54,638
Deet, deet, deet, deet.

1034
01:12:54,738 --> 01:12:58,107
[Chuckling]

1035
01:13:20,664 --> 01:13:22,065
Don't be alarmed, dear.

1036
01:13:22,165 --> 01:13:23,099
It's only me.

1037
01:13:25,935 --> 01:13:27,704
Oh, you startled me.

1038
01:13:27,804 --> 01:13:29,539
I'm so glad you came.

1039
01:13:29,639 --> 01:13:32,876
The signal you sent
was very strong.

1040
01:13:32,976 --> 01:13:34,744
I need your help.

1041
01:13:34,844 --> 01:13:35,545
Yes?

1042
01:13:35,645 --> 01:13:37,280
Go on.

1043
01:13:37,380 --> 01:13:38,915
Well, I'm working on
this case, you see,

1044
01:13:39,015 --> 01:13:41,685
And it's unlike
any of the others.

1045
01:14:17,220 --> 01:14:21,124
[Phone ringing]

1046
01:14:25,294 --> 01:14:26,329
Hello?

1047
01:14:26,429 --> 01:14:27,463
Any luck?

1048
01:14:27,564 --> 01:14:29,666
JESS: Looks like I got
the key to the puzzle.

1049
01:14:29,766 --> 01:14:30,800
Did you get my package?

1050
01:14:30,900 --> 01:14:32,435
Yeah, I got it right here.

1051
01:14:32,536 --> 01:14:35,705
JIM: I was able to get you
his blood and skin samples.

1052
01:14:35,805 --> 01:14:37,073
Anything else?

1053
01:14:37,173 --> 01:14:38,407
Well, what do you mean?

1054
01:14:38,508 --> 01:14:39,709
JESS: Any other samples?

1055
01:14:39,809 --> 01:14:41,110
No, why?

1056
01:14:41,210 --> 01:14:43,513
I need three body fluids.

1057
01:14:43,613 --> 01:14:44,948
I can get the sweat
from the skin.

1058
01:14:45,048 --> 01:14:46,916
I've got the blood.

1059
01:14:47,016 --> 01:14:49,786
Oh, that leaves me one short.

1060
01:14:49,886 --> 01:14:52,822
Well, what do you need,
sperm or something?

1061
01:14:52,922 --> 01:14:55,158
That certainly would qualify.

1062
01:14:55,258 --> 01:14:56,425
Wh... what the hell's going on?

1063
01:14:56,526 --> 01:14:58,995
JESS: Look... look, I'll
figure something out.

1064
01:14:59,095 --> 01:15:01,264
Well, don't do anything stupid.

1065
01:15:01,364 --> 01:15:03,767
Don't do anything
'til you call me.

1066
01:15:03,867 --> 01:15:04,701
Yeah, yeah, yeah, OK.

1067
01:15:04,801 --> 01:15:05,501
All right.

1068
01:15:05,602 --> 01:15:07,503
Look, I gotta go, Jim.

1069
01:15:07,604 --> 01:15:08,504
Bye.

1070
01:15:08,605 --> 01:15:09,505
All right, spy.

1071
01:15:34,564 --> 01:15:44,007
Salamander and dragons,
creatures of fire,

1072
01:15:44,107 --> 01:15:50,580
I call upon thee to
fulfill my desire.

1073
01:15:50,680 --> 01:15:56,452
By fire and smoke, I do
invoke our father from above.

1074
01:15:59,355 --> 01:16:11,400
Feel this right with your
might, with sacredness and love.

1075
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:14,103
I cast thee, oh,
circle of power.

1076
01:16:17,707 --> 01:16:29,318
May this be a sacred place
for the lady and her lover.

1077
01:16:34,290 --> 01:16:40,463
May all that is evil be
banished by the spirit of water

1078
01:16:40,563 --> 01:16:52,375
And Earth, by the spirit of
air, by the spirit of fire,

1079
01:16:52,475 --> 01:16:56,445
By all the elements
and the human spirit.

1080
01:17:00,349 --> 01:17:03,186
I purify the circle.

1081
01:17:03,286 --> 01:17:07,123

Yes, doctor.

01:17:42,025 --> 01:17:43,893
DOCTOR GABRIEL: I didn't hear
from you yesterday, Nico.

1091
01:17:49,833 --> 01:17:55,471
Yeah, well, since
that last operation,

1092
01:17:55,571 --> 01:17:57,406
I've been doing some thinking.

1093
01:17:57,506 --> 01:17:59,809
And what were you
thinking about?

1094
01:18:05,548 --> 01:18:09,552
I've been thinking that I don't
know if I can do this anymore.

on me, are you, dear boy?

01:18:22,231 --> 01:18:25,334
I thought you found the
medical profession rewarding?

1098
01:18:28,938 --> 01:18:30,940
I'll be honest with you, doc.

1099
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:33,943
This last one, it
got kind of messy.

1101
01:18:35,912 --> 01:18:37,613

not enjoying it so much.

1103
01:18:43,386 --> 01:18:48,157

were quick and easy.

real... it was real different.

1106
01:19:05,674 --> 01:19:09,512

as I did for all the others,

bring the patient here.

most sensitive operation.
