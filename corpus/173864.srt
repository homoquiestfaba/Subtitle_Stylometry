1
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,515
Nice playing, Will.

2
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,158
Thanks.

3
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,157
How you getting up there?

4
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,993
- Going by bus.
- How long's that?

5
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,470
It's... five, six hours.

6
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:25,189
- How about some food?
- No, I'm good. I'll see you.

7
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:02,676
- One to Knight's Ridge.
- One-way or round trip?

8
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:06,753
- One-way. How much is that?
- $48.

9
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,276
There you go.

10
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:23,511
OK. Gate 62. That way and turn right.
Have a good trip.

11
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,112
That's it.

12
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,349
Oh, shit.

13
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,598
- Hey.
- Hey.

14
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:18,070
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

15
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,758
No 'buca. What's the matter?
No Sambuca this time?

16
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:26,879
- It's five in the morning, Kev.
- Is that too late or too early?

17
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,518
You guys done for the night?

18
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,556
- Yeah.
- Big storm.

19
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:38,875
- I didn't have any styrofoam.
- That's OK. I'll bring 'em back.

20
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,551
- OK.
- OK.

21
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,438
- Bye, Kev.
- Yeah.

22
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,431
- I'll see you.
- Bye.

23
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:01,111
- What?
- The styrofoam thing creases me.

24
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,873
- What are you talking about?
- First storm,

25
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:08,431
you'd think she'd get
some styrofoam cups for, like, $1.99.

26
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:12,752
- I'll return the mugs this time.
- Shut your fucking hole.

27
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,638
- The chick's married, Tommy.
- No shit.

28
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,549
- She's not home.
- Where is she?

29
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:11,518
- Banging that guy.
- Buddy, she's sleeping.

30
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,670
I'll bet $20 she's banging that guy.

31
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,433
- Bad bet.
- Bad bet? Why?

32
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:19,512
Either way, you lose.
If you win, she's bangin' him.

33
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,876
If you lose, you lose 20 bucks.
Not a smart bet.

34
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,475
- I can't believe her.
- You really think she is?

35
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,596
- I know.
- The meat cutter?

36
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,353
Yes. The fucking meat cutter.

37
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,670
What future can she have?
He cuts meat!

38
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:37,150
- You plough snow.
- At least meat you can eat.

39
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,793
- Why is he here?
- He's an employee.

40
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,309
All right. I'm outta here.
I'll see you at home.

41
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,868
- Don't go by Jan's.
- I'm not.

42
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,632
- Hey.
- You sand my lots?

43
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:56,748
- Yeah. Don't go by there.
- I'm not. Just get my lots.

44
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,989
- He's going by there.
- Without a doubt.

45
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:09,877
- Do I got anything in my 'stache?
- You're clean.

46
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,834
Willie!

47
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:10,674
- Willie!
- Hey, Mo!

48
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:15,389
- How you doing, man?
- All right. Good to see you.

49
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:19,678
- Good to be back?
- I've been back four minutes.

50
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:25,153
- You remember Cheryl and Michael Jr?
- Wow, Mo, they're...

51
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,559
cute.

52
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:31,511
- Yeah. You still seeing that chick?
- What do you mean by seeing?

53
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,591
- You're not engaged?
- No.

54
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,830
Well, it's been... what, a year?

55
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:39,878
11 months, living together for six.

56
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,198
- She hasn't put pressure on you?
- Depends what you mean by pressure.

57
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,071
Hey, kids.

58
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,357
- Hey, you psyched for the reunion?
- Oh, yeah.

59
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,353
- It's great to be back.
- The gang back together.

60
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,398
- Everybody's coming?
- Oh, yeah, everybody.

61
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,160
I can't wait to show you the house.

62
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,118
Come over for brunch.
Sarah'll make her waffles.

63
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,273
- Great. Thanks for the ride.
- No problem. You OK with this?

64
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,032
Yeah, I'm OK. I'm fine.

65
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,430
I'm glad you're home, man.

66
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:39,273
- All right, see you.
- See you soon.

67
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,271
- See you, kids.
- Bye!

68
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,273
- Hey, kids. Who wants ice cream?
- Me!

69
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,875
Hello, Dad.

70
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:27,470
- When did you get in?
- Just now. Mo picked me up.

71
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:33,708
- Got a lot of bags. Staying long?
- I don't know.

72
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:45,475
There's golf on TV.
Would you like to watch some golf?

73
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,192
Sure.

74
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:57,479
Why don't you put your bags upstairs
and come down and watch some golf?

75
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,312
Yeah. Yeah.

76
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,599
Hey!

77
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,716
Oh, man!

78
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,988
- You just getting up?
- Oh, yeah, man.

79
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:48,470
- Wild night. I got wrecked.
- Yeah?

80
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:55,670
- You gonna be home long?
- I don't know. We'll see.

81
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:00,990
- You see Dad?
- Yeah. We're gonna watch some golf.

82
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:08,354
- You missed a hell of a storm.
- Yeah.

83
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:13,155
Hey, when did the Ryans move out?

84
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:16,357
Ryans? I don't know. Last year.

85
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,351
Who moved in?

86
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,033
I don't know.

87
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,635
- They got a kid?
- Do they? I don't know.

88
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,188
Yeah, I think so. They got a kid.

89
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,430
Yeah, I'm gonna take a dump, man.

90
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,233
- Hey! Willie C! What's up?
- Paulie.

91
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:04,278
- You remember Elle MacPherson?
- How you doin'?

92
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,078
Jan's banging some meat cutter.

93
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:10,233
- It started a month ago.
- I heard you got the ultimatum.

94
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,312
Fuck that.
What right does she have to do that?

95
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:17,359
- You've been going out seven years.
- So what's the big deal?

96
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,876
- How old is Jan?
- Don't start with me...

97
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:24,430
- She's 27.
- 27. Maybe she wants to have kids.

98
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:28,195
So what? I wanna have kids, too,
but what's the rush?

99
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:31,477
Kathy Lee Gifford just had a kid
and she's 45.

100
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,836
- So who's this guy?
- Victor the meat cutter.

101
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:38,833
You ready to puke? This guy's 40,
divorced and has three kids.

102
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,832
So there's no way
she's getting sperm from him.

103
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,956
Exactly. I knew you'd understand.

104
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:47,157
You wanna know what really
creases me? Jan's a vegetarian.

105
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,674
- Right.
- You see the hypocrisy?

106
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,558
Jan's a vegetarian.
He's a meat cutter.

107
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,709
Oh, wow!

108
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,758
How can she live
with a man who stinks of brisket?

109
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:59,957
Show time is 12:30
here on Sports Central.

110
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,270
- You're saying six...?
- Six speakers.

111
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:05,113
- Hey, look who's here.
- Hey! What's up?

112
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,794
- Hey!
- It's Sharon. She's sleeping.

113
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,235
Listen, I'll see you in a minute.

114
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,197
All right.

115
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,392
- Hey.
- Yeah?

116
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,597
- It's good to see you.
- Good to see you.

117
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,834
Jesus.

118
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,309
You still seeing that chick?
The lawyer?

119
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,392
- Tracy, yeah.
- Tracy? What's goin' on?

120
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,118
- She's great.
- And?

121
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,952
- What?
- What's the deal?

122
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:41,636
- We're going through this stage...
- They're all sisters. Trust me.

123
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,915
It's one big conspiracy.
Leave it alone.

124
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,197
- You been playing piano?
- Yeah. Nothing steady.

125
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,635
- Good money?
- How they doing?

126
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,439
All he ever thinks about
is Darian Smalls.

127
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:56,876
- Come on! Still?
- Nothing changes around here, Will.

128
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:00,157
Every time Sharon sees Birdy
thinking about Darian,

129
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,152
it's another pound
when she looks in the mirror.

130
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,593
Have you seen her?

131
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:08,798
She's like one of those kids
Sally Struthers feeds paste to.

132
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,791
- We need models.
- What?

133
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:15,237
They're beautiful, rich, you don't
have to spend much time with them.

134
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,709
Fuckers that date models,
they got it made.

135
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:21,031
My next girlfriend's
gonna be a six-foot-tall model.

136
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,314
Definitely.

137
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:24,955
A big one.

138
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,270
- Models.
- I like those chicks.

139
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,951
Don't shovel much, do you?

140
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:51,799
- What makes you say that?
- Your technique, it's sloppy.

141
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:56,510
- You live in a city or warm climate.
- City.

142
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,952
You grew up here?

143
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,399
Yeah. Yeah.

144
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:06,438
- Don't visit much?
- Nope.

145
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,951
- Mom dead?
- You a cop?

146
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,432
No.

147
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,675
Yeah, my mother's dead.

148
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:24,033
I knew it. Your dad's
kind of a sad guy.

149
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:28,511
Your brother is kind of missing that
thing that having a mom gives you.

150
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,511
It's a lonely house you got.

151
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,673
What's your name?

152
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,915
- Marty.
- As in Martha?

153
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,993
As in Marty, named for a grandfather
I never even knew - Martin.

154
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:47,516
So now I'm Marty.
Just Marty. A girl named Marty.

155
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,670
It is the bane of my existence.

156
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:55,959
- How old are you?
- 13, but I'm an old soul.

157
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,435
So why did you come back?

158
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,317
Well...

159
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,870
My high school reunion.

160
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,916
- Heavy.
- Yeah.

161
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,118
- So what's your name?
- Willie.

162
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,998
Willie, I like your 'burns.

163
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,749
Thanks.

164
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:23,197
- You're kinda cool.
- How do you mean?

165
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:29,840
I don't know. It's just a call.
You don't think you are?

166
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,069
I...

167
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,634
I, um...

168
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,350
No, I... I think I am.

169
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,629
You are... I think.

170
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,473
- Yeah?
- Maybe not.

171
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,117
I'm gonna go.

172
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,873
Yeah, I'll see you around...

173
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,632
Marty.

174
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:02,356
Are you Victor?
Excuse me, is your name Victor?

175
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,396
See who's here?

176
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,755
- Shit.
- Are you Victor?

177
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,956
I'm looking for Victor
the meat cutter.

178
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:12,430
I hit a cow
and he could slice me some steaks.

179
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:16,069
- It's a waste to let it rot.
- You're not funny.

180
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,515
I'm serious, Jan.

181
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:23,515
I don't appreciate you burying my
driveway like some obsessed lunatic.

182
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,830
- OK. That's fair.
- What do you want?

183
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:32,354
- I wanna give you this.
- What is that?

184
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,590
- It's a rump roast. Come on.
- Paul...

185
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,716
Come on. At least open it.

186
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:41,430
- I really don't think I should.
- Do you believe this?

187
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:46,835
See what a man
has to go through for love?

188
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,712
It's beautiful, Paul. It's lovely.

189
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:57,552
- It's brown.
- Champagne. It's the newest thing.

190
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,868
It's not brown.

191
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,430
- Champagne? It's beautiful.
- Thank you.

192
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,431
- So what are you doing?
- I can't take it.

193
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,953
- Why not?
- I can't.

194
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,678
- Marry me, Jan.
- No.

195
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:16,232
- "No"? Just like that, "no"?
- No.

196
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,668
- Jesus Christ, Jan!
- You're so selfish.

197
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,593
Selfish? Let me explain something.

198
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:27,754
What's in this box constitutes
30 driveways. Selfish? I think not.

199
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,434
We're taking some time.
This screws everything up.

200
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:34,069
- Paul. What are you doing?
- Chip, cut me some slack.

201
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,913
- You're making a spectacle.
- It's her fault.

202
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,560
Jan? Outside.

203
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,595
- Look, take this ring.
- I got customers, Paul.

204
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,398
- Jan.
- Paul.

205
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,913
Take the fucking ring!

206
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,878
- That's romantic!
- You sucked the romance out.

207
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:58,554
This is the desperate act
of a desperate man.

208
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,916
Only when faced with losing me
do you decide to do this.

209
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,391
So? I didn't like the alternative.
That's how one comes to a decision.

210
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,155
Wrong. One comes to a decision
based on what one wants,

211
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,276
not what one doesn't want, got it?

212
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,510
I got customers.

213
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,590
So how's everything at home?

214
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:28,831
It's all right. It's a little weird.

215
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:32,356
Dad's parked in front of the TV
all the time

216
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:36,228
and my mom's clothes
are still hanging in the closet.

217
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:42,077
- So what did you do Christmas?
- The tiki lounge gets real busy.

218
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:46,119
- Come on. What did you do?
- Went to Pennsylvania with Tracy.

219
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,156
- Met her parents.
- Was it good?

220
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,390
- It was all right.
- Right.

221
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,994
How's Sharon?

222
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:57,351
Sharon? She's OK, you know?

223
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,671
Well, she's actually not that good,
you know...

224
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:04,878
What about the other thing,
the other situation?

225
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,235
Oh, Darian? It's over.

226
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:11,757
- It's over?
- I mean it's practically over.

227
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,637
Wait, it's "practically" over?

228
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:17,429
Well, I mean it's... practically over.
It's over.

229
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:21,991
Listen, how come you never came down
that weekend? I had the whole thing.

230
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:26,915
You know, I got busy and...
I had to stick around, but...

231
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,798
What about spring?
I'll come see you this spring.

232
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,553
Now I know
what I'm doing this spring.

233
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:39,838
Hey, Stinky Womack re-opened
The Johnson Inn.

234
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:42,275
You wanna go by, maybe,

235
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:45,432
- grab a beer or something?
- Yeah. Great.

236
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:06,439
- Hey, what's up, Tommy? Who's that?
- Hey, Stinky!

237
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,238
Hey, Willie!

238
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:12,472
Hey, watch the Stinky stuff.
I'm a proprietor now.

239
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:15,438
- Sorry, Stinky. Nice job!
- Yeah, huh?

240
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:19,957
We got a new bar,
little fireplace, menu, apps.

241
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:24,352
- Apps?
- Yeah. Appetisers. We got apps.

242
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,829
He's the proprietor.
He's got the lingo down.

243
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,319
Willie! Willie C!

244
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,918
- What's up?
- What's up?

245
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,514
You all right?

246
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,591
Scoot over.

247
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:41,911
- What's got him creased?
- This.

248
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,389
- What is it?
- It's a diamond.

249
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:53,351
- Fuckin' thing's brown.
- It's champagne, the newest thing.

250
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,590
- What?
- It's a trend.

251
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:58,717
- Frank, two beers.
- You're so uncultured.

252
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,870
Champagne. It's a nice stone, Paul.

253
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:05,351
I heard about this. They're trying
to create a new market.

254
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:10,230
Oh, right, yeah. They were calling it
"piss" but weren't moving any units.

255
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,151
- What's with you?
- What?

256
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,915
- How much did you pay?
- What difference does it make?

257
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,468
What difference?
Diamonds are colourless.

258
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:22,758
You buy a coloured diamond
for a girl you're not even seeing.

259
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:25,877
- You been eating retard sandwiches.
- I don't need your shit.

260
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:30,476
- I think you do.
- Fuck you, Mr High Horse.

261
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,915
You're like a human Geraldo episode.

262
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,355
- What does that mean?
- Guys...

263
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:39,115
You got one broad destroying her
marriage, one destroying her stomach.

264
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,033
- You just watch hockey.
- Don't push it.

265
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:45,669
What are you gonna do?
Beat me up after class?

266
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,638
This ain't high school any more.
The legend's dead.

267
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,439
- The legend can still fuck you up.
- Bullshit!

268
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,431
- Paul...
- Butt out, Conway.

269
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,512
Don't waltz in here
with your big city bullshit.

270
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,192
- Fucking loser.
- Faggot.

271
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,872
- Prick.
- Asshole.

272
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:03,396
Free apps! I got free apps.

273
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,393
What?

274
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,309
Hey!

275
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,593
Willie boy.

276
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:21,716
- What are you doin'?
- Hanging out.

277
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:27,158
I like to mash snow, it gives me
a sense of self-satisfaction.

278
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:33,790
- You got a girlfriend?
- Why do you ask?

279
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:38,469
I don't know. You're a dude in flux.

280
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:42,473
You've come back to the house
of loneliness and tears,

281
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:47,793
to daddy downer and brother bummer,
to come to some decision about life.

282
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:50,155
A life decision, if you will.

283
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,710
You fancy yourself a perceptive
little thing, don't you?

284
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:57,588
I don't know about "little".
I'm the tallest girl in my class.

285
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,636
I may grow to be 5' 10".

286
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,796
I'll be hot.

287
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,273
Well...

288
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:10,717
Am I right? Life decision? You
got the full-on Hamlet thing going?

289
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,917
Hamlet? Danish prince,
couldn't make decisions.

290
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,274
Yeah, I know Hamlet.

291
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:19,239
So, about that girlfriend?

292
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,591
Yeah. Yeah, there is one.

293
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:29,515
- She want to get married?
- I think so.

294
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,556
- You don't?
- I'm not sure.

295
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:35,872
- Is she fat?
- No! She's quite nice actually.

296
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:40,431
- So why don't you marry her?
- I knew I came for a reason!

297
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,351
Thank you.

298
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:46,194
- That's OK. Tease the little kid.
- See you around.

299
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,357
See ya.

300
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,999
Sharon?

301
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,799
Sharon? What?

302
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:08,034
It would be nice if when we were
making love, you'd be thinking of me.

303
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:11,351
- Huh?
- She's not gonna leave him, Tommy.

304
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:17,512
I don't know what you're talking
about. I haven't seen her in months.

305
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,511
I am not stupid.

306
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,395
So you wanna end this?

307
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:27,029
That'd be convenient.
Save you the guilt? I end it?

308
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:34,035
Let me ask you something.
What do I do?

309
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:37,954
The best years
of your life were high school,

310
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:42,397
when you were the king of the hill
and Darian was your girlfriend.

311
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,597
You want all that back.
I can't give that to you.

312
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:50,435
How do I compete with a life that
is impossible for you to have again?

313
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:57,639
You're gonna have to break up
with him now.

314
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:01,952
Getting over him, that's the hard
part. I know. Believe me, I know.

315
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:06,470
She's right.
At first, you'll have these visions

316
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:12,237
of you alone, 57, 58,
walking around, your hair in a bun -

317
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:15,232
maybe you're a librarian -
heating up soup for one

318
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:17,993
and worrying
about the cobwebs in your womb.

319
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:22,198
- Gina.
- The visions fade, that's my point.

320
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:25,078
You will get over him
in about two years.

321
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:29,551
You'll be 29. It'd be better
if you were 24 now, then you'd be 26,

322
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,596
but we don't choose these things.

323
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:35,593
- They choose us.
- Exactly. So, 29.

324
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:38,319
- That's not exactly ancient.
- Not exactly 30.

325
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,789
- Which is good.
- Which is very good.

326
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:47,272
Look, I know what you're saying
and I know how bad it looks,

327
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:54,869
but nobody knows what it's like
when it's just the two of us.

328
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,791
I love him.

329
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,953
OK. No, that's fair.

330
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,916
So how is it?

331
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:11,751
- Lately, it's not so good.
- The man can't commit.

332
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,193
The man can't commit.

333
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:17,113
Why is it
when a relationship doesn't work out,

334
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:20,590
we say it's cos they can't commit?

335
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:24,593
- Shouldn't I take some of the blame?
- No. That is grief talking.

336
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:28,309
- No way is that Sharon.
- It's a little grief-stricken girl

337
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,436
who looks a lot like Sharon.

338
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:32,988
I'm still not sure they're broken up.

339
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:35,913
You're broken up, right?

340
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:41,428
I don't know.
It's Tommy's birthday next week.

341
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,909
It's on Saturday. I mean...

342
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,390
Maybe if I threw him a party
with all his friends

343
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:50,597
and we just had a nice time,
just relaxed...

344
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:55,150
Would you guys help me organise it?

345
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,033
Would you, please?

346
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,279
One more.

347
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,194
One more.

348
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:36,870
Michael and my father, they both fall
off the boat, right into the lake.

349
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:40,475
- It was classic.
- He got the picture, though.

350
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,357
It's good.

351
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:47,389
- So you been working much?
- A few nights, you know.

352
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:50,995
But I'm actually toying
with the idea of becoming a citizen.

353
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,196
Oh, what do you mean?

354
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:59,469
Well, I got offered this sales job.
It's got a pretty good base salary,

355
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:04,509
plus commission and...
I don't know. They'll let me know.

356
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:07,353
- That sounds great.
- Yeah, it could be.

357
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,919
Yeah.

358
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:13,436
You... I'm gonna go get the video.

359
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:17,638
- Of this? See him fall in... Yeah.
- You're gonna love it.

360
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,159
What?

361
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:25,952
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

362
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,632
- That's bogus.
- Why?

363
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:31,474
Cos you get that job, you won't have
any time to play the piano.

364
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:35,473
Mo, listen, it's not happening.
It's just not happening.

365
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:38,632
I'm getting older
and I gotta think about the future.

366
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,553
You would be
the worst salesman ever, OK?

367
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:45,349
I deal with salesmen every day
and you... you are no salesman.

368
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:48,477
Well, thanks
for the vote of confidence.

369
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:51,438
What the hell do you know
about office equipment?

370
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:55,195
What do you know about kids?
You're raising two just fine.

371
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,230
- Dad!
- Sarah?

372
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:10,231
See these guys?
Husky Pete, Rizzo and Sammy Bean?

373
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:15,872
They work all day, drink all night
for 40 fucking years.

374
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:19,032
Two weeks out of the year,
they take a vacation.

375
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:24,069
What do they do?
Drink all day and drink all night.

376
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:28,676
Does this little observation
contain anything resembling a point?

377
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:29,829
Yes, Tom.

378
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:34,719
If we don't step it up,
we'll wind up just like Husky Pete

379
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,314
and Rizzo and Sammy Bean.

380
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,114
Cool.

381
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,918
Cool?

382
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,471
Holy shit!

383
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,673
- Hi, Frank.
- Hey!

384
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,519
Oh, it's good to see you.

385
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:57,353
- What is that?
- That is unbelievable.

386
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:01,433
- Stink, who's the vixen?
- It's my cousin from Chicago.

387
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:05,069
- No way.
- No way does she share your blood.

388
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:09,551
Yes, she does, and she is not only
hot, she is also completely cool.

389
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:12,757
- Unbelievable.
- Does she have a boyfriend?

390
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:16,992
What do you think? A girl
like that's born with a boyfriend.

391
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:20,919
I'm gonna go say hi to Stanley.

392
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,436
- Stanley?
- Hey, you.

393
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:28,471
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

394
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:32,030
I got some friends
I want you to meet. Come here.

395
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:35,110
Oh, man, this should be fun.

396
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:41,118
Andera, this is Tommy...

397
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,236
- Kev...
- Hi.

398
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:45,436
- Paul...
- Hi.

399
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:47,750
- Willie.
- Guys...

400
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,592
- Hey, Stink.
- I'm sorry. And Mo.

401
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:52,433
- Hi, Mo.
- Hi.

402
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,795
Guys, Andera.

403
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,192
Hi.

404
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:59,919
I'll be here if you need me.

405
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,992
So what part of Chicago you from?

406
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:08,359
- Do you know Chicago?
- Yeah... I know Soldier's Field.

407
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:10,635
That's a football field.

408
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,359
- She said it.
- So what do you do?

409
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:19,998
- I'm in advertising.
- Advertising! That's great.

410
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:23,390
- What do you guys do?
- What do we do?

411
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:28,076
- Well, Paul and I have...
...a business.

412
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,196
- Construction...
- Painting...

413
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:33,670
- Kevin works for me.
- I work with him.

414
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:37,036
- Mo works in a textile plant.
- I'm plant manager.

415
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,076
And Willie here's a musician.

416
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:42,836
- What do you play?
- Piano.

417
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:45,309
- Would you play something?
- No, no...

418
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,914
- Hey, Will, play something.
- No...

419
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,479
Come on.

420
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:52,233
- Come on. You never play any more.
- I know.

421
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,276
- He's good.
- I need a shot.

422
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:58,069
- Do you guys want to do a shot?
- Shots? We love shots.

423
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:03,518
- Er, woo-woos, melon balls?
- Chicks like num-nums.

424
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:07,832
- Whiskey.
- Whiskey, yeah. Whiskey it is.

425
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,876
- Stan, six shorts.
- Who's Stan?

426
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:12,110
You got it.

427
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:14,270
Thank you.

428
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,759
Gotcha.

429
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,353
Irish.

430
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:22,748
So, Willie,
you gonna play something or what?

431
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:26,470
All right. All right.

432
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,913
All right.

433
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,109
Hey, buddy.

434
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:48,397
Why'd you mention the piano?
We can't compete with that.

435
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,914
Show her how you spread mulch.
That's sexy.

436
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,595
Stinky's cousin. He's related!

437
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:12,474
What's this song?

438
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,391
You don't know this?

439
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,753
Take it, buddy.

440
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:39,396
I'm done speaking to both of you, OK?
You're both fucking insane.

441
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:44,429
You know what your problem is? MTV,
Playboy and Madison fucking Avenue.

442
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,795
Yes. Let me explain something to you.

443
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:49,155
Girls with big tits have big asses.

444
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:52,755
Girls with little tits have
little asses. That's how it goes.

445
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,956
God doesn't fuck around. He's fair.

446
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,270
He gave the fatties
big, beautiful tits

447
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:59,669
and the skinnies
little, tiny niddlers.

448
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,638
It's not my rule.
If you don't like it, call him.

449
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,278
Hey, Mitch.

450
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,634
Thank you.

451
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:11,075
Oh, guys, look what we have here.

452
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:13,833
Look. Your favourite.
Oh, you like that?

453
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:17,629
- I can go with that.
- Nice? Well, it doesn't exist.

454
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:21,235
Look at the hair.
It's long, flowing - like a river.

455
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:23,231
Well, it's a fucking weave, OK?

456
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:26,949
And the tits. Please!
I could hang my overcoat on them.

457
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,554
Tits, by design, were invented
to be suckled by babies.

458
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:33,553
Yes, they're purely functional.
These are silicone city.

459
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:36,200
And look - my favourite,
the shaved pubis.

460
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:39,556
Pubic hair being so unruly and all.

461
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:42,712
This is a mockery, a sham.
This is bullshit.

462
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,834
Implants, collagen, plastic,
capped teeth, the fat sucked out,

463
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:50,957
the hair extended,
the nose fixed, the bush shaved...

464
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,713
These are not real women.
They're beauty freaks.

465
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:56,553
They make us normal women
with our wrinkles,

466
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:00,792
our puckered boobs - hi, Bob - our
cellulite, feel somehow inadequate.

467
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,518
Well, I don't buy it.

468
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:07,310
But if you think there's a chance
you could get one of these women,

469
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:11,154
you don't give us real women
any commitment - it's pathetic.

470
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:15,597
What do you think you'll do? You'll
end up drooling in some nursing home,

471
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:18,797
then you'll decide that it's time
to settle down, have kids?!

472
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,633
You gonna find a cheerleader?
Charge it, Mitch.

473
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,915
- You're oversimplifying.
- Oh, eat me!

474
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,629
Look at Paul - models on the wall,
dog named Elle MacPherson.

475
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:30,553
He's insane! He's obsessed.
You're all obsessed.

476
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:34,474
If you had an ounce of self-esteem,
of self-worth, of self-confidence,

477
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:39,190
you would realise that as trite as it
may sound, beauty is truly skin deep.

478
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:43,239
And if you did hook a model,
I guarantee you'd be sick of her.

479
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,515
Yeah, I suppose I'd get sick of her

480
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:48,672
after about, what, 20 or 30 years?

481
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:54,719
Get over yourself. Thank you, Mitch.
Say hello to Gertrude.

482
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,997
No matter how perfect the nipple,
how supple the thigh,

483
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:01,629
unless there's some other shit
going on besides the physical,

484
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:03,199
it's going to get old, OK?

485
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:06,113
And you guys have got to get a grip,

486
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:09,954
otherwise the future
of the human race is in jeopardy.

487
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:14,479
What was that?

488
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,357
I have to wait for you, Pete?

489
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:18,078
I don't know.

490
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:22,711
- Great ass.
- Nice tits. Come on. Let's go.

491
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,870
- Hey.
- What's up?

492
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,712
Nothing.

493
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:58,156
Who's the guy?

494
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:04,478
- Andrew Willis. He's in my class.
- Oh. He your boyfriend?

495
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:08,034
I don't know. I guess. He's OK.

496
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,756
He seemed a little short.

497
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:14,515
- He's 12 years old, Willie.
- Oh, right.

498
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:18,399
So, he's not really... Right.

499
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,152
Are you OK?

500
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,196
Yeah. Yeah, I'm... Why?

501
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:26,319
- You seem a little flavoured today.
- No! No, I'm cool.

502
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,992
Cool.

503
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,433
Yeah.

504
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:34,153
So, tell me something.
What do you kids...?

505
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:37,437
What is it you do, kids your age,
on the weekend?

506
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:41,195
Well, what we've been doing lately
is smoking massive amounts of drugs,

507
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:43,999
bingeing on Entenmanns
and listening to Pink Floyd.

508
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:45,195
Really?

509
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,840
You are flavoured today.

510
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:52,318
- Oh, you're kidding?
- The Entenmanns part was true.

511
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:55,198
Oh. Wow.

512
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:59,876
So... you like this guy Andrew?

513
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:05,397
He's OK. He's into male contraception
which is nice for a change.

514
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:09,837
Joking.
You really got to chill, Will.

515
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,956
Right. Right.

516
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:16,273
I'm gonna go inside.

517
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:19,318
- You sure you're OK?
- I'll be OK.

518
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,072
Good.

519
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,918
Hey, Marty!

520
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,273
Yes?

521
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:31,519
Ah, forgot what I was going to say.

522
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,359
See you around.

523
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:37,912
Bye.

524
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:44,829
- I owe you five bucks, right?
- I think it's more than that.

525
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:47,832
- This controller's broken.
- Shut up.

526
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:50,480
- My X button doesn't work.
- You always say that.

527
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:53,028
It's not fair. Hey, was that Tracy?

528
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:54,553
Yep.

529
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,596
- Is she hot?
- She's nice.

530
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:59,717
Ascribe a numerical value -
face, body, personality.

531
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,756
I'm not gonna do that.

532
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:04,513
- Come on. Do it.
- Don't be vile.

533
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:07,751
- Grow up. Do it.
- You don't have to.

534
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:09,831
I don't know, let's see. Face...

535
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:13,993
- We need a frame of reference.
- I thought I was vile.

536
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:16,116
- You gotta do it proper.
- Who?

537
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,838
Kelly Norman.

538
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:22,152
All right. Let's see.
Kelly Norman - face, six;

539
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:24,913
body, eight and a half;

540
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,831
personality, four.

541
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:29,753
Yes, sir.

542
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:32,400
- Jennifer Colton.
- Jennifer Colton?

543
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,672
Face, one;

544
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:39,153
body, two; personality, three.

545
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:42,949
- OK, I got it, so...
- Wait!

546
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:45,395
Carmen Swisher.

547
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:48,474
- Who?
- Carmen Swisher, man. Porn star.

548
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:50,949
- I don't know her.
- Yeah, you do.

549
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,632
She's in Fistful Of Vixens.

550
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:57,316
The one who gets all of her orifices
penetrated by those circus midgets?

551
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:00,870
Oh shit, that's her?
That's her name? She's good.

552
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,916
- Very talented girl.
- Very talented.

553
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,592
Face, seven;

554
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:07,114
body, nine and a half...

555
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:11,278
and personality -
well, the sky's the limit.

556
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,868
Those midgets
got a real kick out of her.

557
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,154
Exactly.

558
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:18,549
So do Tracy now.

559
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:20,278
Tracy.

560
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:27,594
Face - good, solid...
seven and a half.

561
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:32,877
Body - good, solid...
seven and a half.

562
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:37,555
Personality - good, solid...

563
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:40,758
seven and a half.

564
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:44,116
- Sounds excellent, man.
- When's she coming in?

565
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:49,194
He has the puck! He shoots,
he scores. Yes! Two nothing.

566
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:55,078
Tommy, would you mind pulling over?
I have to go to the bathroom.

567
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:58,550
What? We're gonna be
at the restaurant in five minutes.

568
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:02,235
No, it's gonna take longer than that.
We could just pull in here.

569
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:05,312
The VFW? We'll be at the restaurant
in five minutes.

570
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:08,710
I'm not feeling good.
I just need to go in quick.

571
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:11,837
Did you eat today?
Did you eat anything?

572
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:14,036
- I ate.
- What did you eat?

573
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:18,113
- What did you eat?
- It doesn't matter what I ate.

574
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:22,398
You never eat, then get stomach pains
and wonder why.

575
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:25,472
- Cos you didn't eat.
- I did so.

576
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:27,949
You can't do this.
It's eight o'clock...

577
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:30,429
- Stop it.
- All right. Forget it.

578
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:34,069
- Good.
- I'm concerned, that's all.

579
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:36,275
Surprise!

580
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:48,875
That's nice.

581
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:53,949
Happy Birthday, Birdy.

582
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:58,238
- Did you know?
- I had no idea.

583
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,629
Let's get the party started.

584
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:02,597
- I'm DJing.
- No.

585
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:04,989
Paul, no. No Jethro Tull.

586
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:12,518
Hey, you're looking great.

587
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:22,998
- He didn't know.
- It was beautiful.

588
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:34,510
- Second course.
- That's right.

589
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:37,637
- Yo, what's up, guys?
- What's up, man?

590
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:43,713
Spider, let me explain.
This is my domain.

591
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:45,791
Let me explain something, my friend.

592
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:48,189
This is my domain. I don't want...

593
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:56,759
It ought to be Stinky's - big sign...

594
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:58,876
Our motto - "Go ugly early".

595
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:06,030
I like that. Stinky's.
It would look good on the matches.

596
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:12,434
You know what I was thinking?
We planned all this in the salon...

597
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:15,159
Congratulations to all of us.

598
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:17,515
You're happy, I'm happy, Sharon.

599
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:36,753
Hey, Darian.

600
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:42,513
- What the fuck is she doing?
- Your boy's fucked now, buddy.

601
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:46,434
- Holy shit!
- Oh, Christ!

602
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:50,399
Food for the hungry,
drink for the thirsty...

603
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:56,031
- Shit.
- The odds just increased.

604
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:57,678
Fuck, man. Who told her?

605
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:02,436
It's all right. I'm sure
she's just gonna walk right back out.

606
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:04,192
Darian.

607
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:07,794
- Hey.
- Happy birthday.

608
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:11,759
- That's really nice. Thanks.
- I got this for your birthday.

609
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:16,834
- I mean this is for you and for me.
- Thanks, guys.

610
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:21,277
- It's too much.
- Somebody should go over.

611
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:23,316
You smell good.

612
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:26,919
- Let's get outta here.
- You wanna go?

613
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,878
- We're going!
- Fine. I'm ready to go.

614
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:33,396
She polluted the air,
as far as I'm concerned.

615
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:38,429
- Don't even think twice about it.
- Get home early. Pay the sitter.

616
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:41,594
- Do you like it?
- I don't know.

617
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:43,989
- I put the bow on.
- It's really nice.

618
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:47,595
- Should we do something?
- What?

619
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:49,636
What the fuck is that?

620
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:55,789
- I don't understand.
- I have no idea why she's here.

621
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:58,678
But it's classic Birdman.

622
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:01,320
It's not funny, but it is true.

623
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:23,479
- Steven's in New York.
- That's great. Great.

624
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:26,915
Kristen's with my folks.

625
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,353
Uh-huh.

626
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:37,512
It was your special night, Tommy.

627
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,468
Why couldn't I share
in your special night?

628
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:43,596
Because...

629
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:44,908
Good night, Darian.

630
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:49,470
I want you to come inside.

631
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:52,074
I'm not goin' inside.

632
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:58,076
Come on, Tommy.
I have to give you your real present.

633
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:01,550
What you gave me is fine, OK?
Darian, come on.

634
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:04,995
Come on.

635
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:07,753
You can slip into
something more comfortable.

636
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:09,512
Like what?

637
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:11,272
Like me.

638
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:26,437
- Come on, Darian. I gotta go.
- Come on, Tommy. Grow up.

639
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:29,432
I gotta go. Just go inside, will you?

640
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:32,831
Just get out.

641
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,715
We always gotta do this, don't we?

642
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:46,109
Just go inside.

643
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:49,791
OK. Fuck it.

644
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:55,198
Stupid truck.

645
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:08,072
All I'm saying is
you have this amazing thing,

646
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:12,119
you got his person with all
that potential, all that future...

647
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:15,909
This girl... is gonna be amazing.

648
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,834
She's smart,
she's funny... she's hot...

649
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:22,354
- She's 13!
- I know. Get over it.

650
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:25,432
It's not a sexual thing. This is...

651
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:27,476
- I could wait.
- What?

652
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:32,076
In ten years, she'll be 23,
I'll be 39, it won't be a big deal.

653
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:34,720
Willie... you're scaring me here.

654
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,950
This girl is gonna be amazing.

655
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:40,553
Great.

656
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:48,396
I was actually jealous
of this little kid on a bike,

657
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:53,110
this short little kid on a bike,
cos he gets to be her age now.

658
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:57,113
I get to be some vile old man,
like... What's his name?

659
00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:00,909
- Roman Polanski.
- No, like... Nabokov.

660
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,912
Like some Nabokov character.

661
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:09,154
Like some old fat, hairy, fat,
stinky, putrid man.

662
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:12,198
And...

663
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:16,671
I don't know. You just want to say
to her in all sincerity,

664
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:19,513
"Take me with you when you go."

665
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:26,789
Willie, the girl was a zygote
when you were in the seventh grade.

666
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:32,437
So what? What are you saying?

667
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:36,195
That this is my way
of postponing the inevitable?

668
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:39,033
My way of saying
I don't wanna grow old?

669
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:43,750
No, I think it's your way
of saying you don't want to grow up.

670
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:57,030
I just want something beautiful.

671
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:03,073
We all want something beautiful.

672
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:37,956
Hi, Mrs Cassidy. I know it's late.
I'm sorry. Is Sharon home?

673
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:41,396
- She's sleeping, Tom.
- Can I see her?

674
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:44,233
- She's sleeping.
- OK.

675
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:49,119
I'm sorry. Could you just tell her
that I stopped by?

676
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:55,794
You should know Sharon put a lot
of planning into tonight, Tom.

677
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:01,559
Mom, it's all right. Go to bed.

678
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:03,513
Hey.

679
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:06,160
I just... I want to apologise.

680
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:09,869
You don't have to. I'm fine.

681
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:11,837
I feel that I should explain.

682
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:15,754
You know what, Tommy?
It's a little late.

683
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:20,710
Yeah. OK.

684
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:30,832
All right.

685
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:40,276
Willie C. What's up?

686
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:42,351
- Hey, fellas.
- What's goin' on?

687
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:45,236
You never went home last night?

688
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:48,392
Came here. Pike is runnin'.
Haven't caught a thing.

689
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:51,313
- Guess what I did this morning.
- What?

690
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:55,393
Made a phone call to Stinky's cousin,
the lovely Andera.

691
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:59,837
- What happened?
- She's going out with me. Thank you.

692
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:01,717
Like on a date?

693
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:06,035
We didn't get into specifics.
Jealous?

694
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:09,598
- Well...
- A little bit.

695
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:13,153
Come on, Elle. Let's get some air.

696
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:22,312
Jesus!

697
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:25,512
Is that Mo?

698
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,070
Fuckin' Mo has got it wired, man.

699
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:31,038
He's like a retard
that doesn't know any better.

700
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:34,669
He doesn't desire new experiences,
new women, nothing. Look at him.

701
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:38,799
He's like the mental patient
that doesn't know he's mental.

702
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:41,394
So he's perfectly content.

703
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:45,359
- I gotta go take a piss.
- I'll see you later.

704
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:56,629
Hey!

705
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:00,435
I'll see you later.

706
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:08,670
What the heck are you doing here?

707
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:12,435
My friends are ice fishing
in the shack over there.

708
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:14,272
Those guys are your friends?

709
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:17,033
- You know 'em?
- They're here every Sunday.

710
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:21,432
We call them the Drunken Dry-heavin'
Cheese-eatin' Outhouse Boys.

711
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:23,636
They're your friends?

712
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:27,269
- They're acquaintances, really.
- Right.

713
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:30,351
- So, where's Scooter?
- Who?

714
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:34,194
What's his name? Billy? Tiger?
Pookie? The kid on the bike?

715
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:37,158
- Andrew?
- Andrew, that's it. Where is he?

716
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:40,835
He dorked out on me.
I'm not into him any more.

717
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:43,354
Ah. So you got someone new?

718
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:50,397
Yep. You!

719
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:52,155
What?

720
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:55,758
You. You're my new boyfriend.
You up to it?

721
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:57,398
Oh, I feel faint!

722
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:02,757
My hero.

723
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:08,193
So you gonna marry that girl in NYC?

724
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:10,236
I don't know. Why?

725
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:14,198
- I don't think you should.
- How come?

726
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:18,034
You should wait until
you meet someone who excites you.

727
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:20,475
Well, she may not be out there.

728
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:24,030
It's like the Wizard of Oz.
It was in your own backyard.

729
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:26,714
What do you mean?

730
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:29,155
You. Me and you.

731
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,753
- Really?
- Yep. You don't think?

732
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:38,957
Well, we have a little age problem.

733
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:41,838
I know. We're as star-crossed
as Romeo and Juliet.

734
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:44,388
It's a tragedy
of Elizabethan proportions.

735
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:46,789
"What light
through yonder window breaks?

736
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:48,916
"Tis the east
and Juliet is the sun."

737
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:56,313
- Weird.
- No way.

738
00:57:57,320 --> 00:57:59,834
So, um... So what do we do?

739
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:03,879
Alas, poor Romeo, we can't do diddly.
You'll go to penitentiary,

740
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:06,918
I'll be the laughing stock
of the Brownies.

741
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:10,834
But if your feelings for me are true,
you'll wait.

742
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:12,795
Wait?

743
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:16,998
Yep. Wait 5 years.

744
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:20,470
I'll be 18 and we can walk
through this world together.

745
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:29,315
- In 5 years you won't remember me.
- William.

746
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:32,870
I'm formed and you're not.
You have changes to go through.

747
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:34,791
You'll change.

748
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:37,269
And I'll be Winnie The Pooh
to your Christopher Robin.

749
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:41,239
No literary reference left unturned.
How do you figure Pooh?

750
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:44,073
Christopher Robin outgrew Pooh.
That's how it ended.

751
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:47,755
He had Pooh when he was a child.
When he matured,

752
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:51,276
he didn't need him any more.

753
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:54,033
That's the saddest thing
I ever heard.

754
00:58:54,120 --> 00:58:56,554
Yeah, but it's true.

755
00:58:56,640 --> 00:59:00,918
You don't realise it now,
but you'll be doing some changing.

756
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:07,190
And...

757
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:10,152
I can't be a Pooh.

758
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:18,519
- I think I'll skate away now, Pooh.
- All right, Christopher.

759
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:11,951
- Hey, Earl.
- Hey, good one!

760
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:25,716
Sit down here. It's a better view.

761
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:35,152
So, where are your buddies?

762
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:40,036
- Huh?
- Your buddies?

763
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:42,076
Oh, they're gonna be late.

764
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:45,152
Hi. A bottle
of your best champagne, please.

765
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:48,357
We don't have a best champagne.
They're all the same.

766
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:51,318
Thank you. That'll be fine.

767
01:00:57,560 --> 01:00:59,118
You really look nice.

768
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:03,397
- What is going on?
- What do you mean?

769
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:05,835
- What are you doing?
- What?

770
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:09,879
- What's with this Al Capone shit?
- What Al Capone shit?

771
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:11,632
Who's the girl?

772
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:14,473
- What girl?
- That girl right over there.

773
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:18,514
She's... She's my book-keeper.

774
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:20,158
- Your book-keeper?
- Yes.

775
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:24,472
- You are full of shit.
- She's very efficient, that girl.

776
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:29,509
Paul, I'm gonna get up and make
the biggest scene you can imagine.

777
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:33,479
She's my cousin. We fell out
and we don't speak in public.

778
01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:37,075
- Bye, Paul. I'm leaving.
- All right, all right.

779
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:39,958
She's my ex-girlfriend.
We broke up after seven years

780
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:43,316
because she's seeing
that meat cutter over there.

781
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:47,234
It drives me crazy, OK? And...

782
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:50,312
I was just showing off.

783
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:53,391
Why didn't you just tell me?

784
01:01:55,120 --> 01:01:57,475
Just please don't make a scene.

785
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:01,358
Oh, we'll make a scene.
You don't need this.

786
01:02:49,360 --> 01:02:51,351
Who is that?

787
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:54,113
- It's Paul.
- No shit.

788
01:02:56,720 --> 01:02:58,676
- Who's the babe?
- I don't know.

789
01:02:58,760 --> 01:03:00,716
She's gorgeous.

790
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:03,948
Well, not gorgeous like you.

791
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:06,793
- Gorgeous just the same.
- Can we leave?

792
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:08,233
Sure.

793
01:03:26,360 --> 01:03:27,509
Fuck!

794
01:03:35,840 --> 01:03:37,990
- Andera, where you goin'?
- Home.

795
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:41,072
- Why?
- That was for you.

796
01:03:41,160 --> 01:03:44,596
I was trying to help you out.
You're such a knucklehead.

797
01:03:44,680 --> 01:03:47,752
- Come back inside.
- Bye, Paul.

798
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:50,195
- Andera...
- Bye, Paul.

799
01:03:50,280 --> 01:03:53,033
- Come on.
- Bye, Paul.

800
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:55,076
I'll call you tomorrow, all right?

801
01:03:56,120 --> 01:03:59,112
- She likes fresh air, you know?
- Sure.

802
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:57,869
Hey, what you doin' out so late?

803
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:02,197
I was out with your friend Paul.

804
01:05:03,360 --> 01:05:06,955
He's not my friend,
he lives in my house.

805
01:05:07,040 --> 01:05:10,476
I got roaches,
I got termites and I got Paul.

806
01:05:10,560 --> 01:05:12,949
- You need a lift?
- No.

807
01:05:13,040 --> 01:05:15,952
It's nice to be able
to walk after dark.

808
01:05:16,040 --> 01:05:19,476
Yeah, it's one of the few perks
of living here.

809
01:05:19,560 --> 01:05:21,312
It's a good one.

810
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:27,390
Can I ask a question? How long have
you been with your boyfriend?

811
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:30,597
- Eight months.
- And it's good?

812
01:05:30,680 --> 01:05:32,272
It's very good.

813
01:05:32,360 --> 01:05:33,873
He makes you happy?

814
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:35,234
Yeah.

815
01:05:39,040 --> 01:05:44,353
I look for that in a man. The ones
who make me miserable never last.

816
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:45,714
Right.

817
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:50,715
There's four words I need to hear
before I go to sleep. Four words.

818
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:54,475
Good night, sweet girl.
That's all it takes.

819
01:05:56,040 --> 01:05:58,315
I'm easy, I know.

820
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:02,791
But a guy who can muster up those
words is a guy I'll stay with.

821
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:05,792
Right. You sure
you don't need a ride?

822
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:11,399
- Yeah.
- All right.

823
01:06:11,480 --> 01:06:14,074
- See you around.
- I'll see you.

824
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:21,109
Good night, sweet girl.

825
01:06:35,240 --> 01:06:39,199
I spoke to Jan this morning
and it's obvious she no longer cares.

826
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:43,159
She ran out of that restaurant
like a maniac, but I guess later,

827
01:06:43,240 --> 01:06:45,754
she realised she didn't give a shit.

828
01:06:45,840 --> 01:06:48,070
Yeah?

829
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:51,152
I spoke to Tracy.
She's coming up for the reunion.

830
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:53,754
Is that right?
I gotta meet this Tracy.

831
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:59,915
- You got to take this shit down.
- Why?

832
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:04,073
- You're like a serial killer.
- Don't cap on my supermodels.

833
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:06,355
- Leave it alone.
- It's creepy.

834
01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:08,556
Look who's talking,
Mr Jerry Lee Lewis.

835
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:10,710
Oh, fucking Mo!

836
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:14,554
I don't judge. If she can cut
her own food, she's fair game.

837
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:20,590
OK. All I'm saying is you got to take
all this down because it's creepy...

838
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:25,708
Look. The supermodel's a beautiful
girl, Will. She can make you dizzy,

839
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:27,916
like you've been drinking
Jack all morning.

840
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:31,993
She can make you feel high for
the greatest commodity known to man -

841
01:07:32,080 --> 01:07:34,389
promise, the promise of a better day,

842
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:36,277
the promise of a greater hope,

843
01:07:36,360 --> 01:07:38,157
the promise of a new tomorrow.

844
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:43,075
This particular ore can be found
in the gait of a beautiful girl -

845
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:46,197
in her smile, in her soul,

846
01:07:46,280 --> 01:07:49,829
in the way she makes every rotten
thing about life seem OK.

847
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:54,799
The supermodels, Willie? That's all
they are - bottled promise.

848
01:07:55,880 --> 01:07:58,917
Scenes from a new day,
hope in stiletto heels.

849
01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:07,316
I am now going to
check your freezer for human heads.

850
01:08:07,960 --> 01:08:11,714
A beautiful girl's all-powerful
and that is as good as love.

851
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:13,313
That's as good as love.

852
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:15,674
It's...

853
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:22,108
just that I gotta think
beyond a couple times a week.

854
01:08:22,200 --> 01:08:25,272
I feel like
the biggest scumbag on earth

855
01:08:25,360 --> 01:08:27,794
every time
I see your kid smiling at me.

856
01:08:27,880 --> 01:08:29,711
Look, Mommy.

857
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:32,119
That's nice, honey.

858
01:08:33,240 --> 01:08:35,515
It's ridiculous.

859
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:38,797
It's making me nuts.
It's making you nuts.

860
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:40,757
Sharon, Steven...

861
01:08:41,800 --> 01:08:45,315
I have worked it
so that he has no idea.

862
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:48,517
That's cos I don't show up
at your parties drunk.

863
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:53,116
- Sharon knew way before then.
- Maybe Steve doesn't give a shit.

864
01:08:53,200 --> 01:08:58,069
Tommy, don't try to characterise
my marriage as a bad one.

865
01:08:58,160 --> 01:09:02,472
- I love Steven.
- So why are you fucking me?

866
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:04,312
I don't know.

867
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:09,554
But I guess I won't be any more.

868
01:09:10,720 --> 01:09:14,156
No. I guess not.

869
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:16,876
I wonder how I'll survive.

870
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:18,518
Oh, please!

871
01:09:25,760 --> 01:09:29,639
I told Steven
the reunion would be a total bore.

872
01:09:29,720 --> 01:09:34,157
And I assume Sharon
won't be accompanying you, right?

873
01:09:34,240 --> 01:09:37,471
No, you've taken care of that.

874
01:09:37,560 --> 01:09:39,312
- Mom.
- What?

875
01:09:56,200 --> 01:10:00,239
OK, sweetie. Come on.
We'll go home, OK?

876
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:02,595
All right, put the other arm in.

877
01:10:02,680 --> 01:10:04,636
OK. Very good.

878
01:10:07,160 --> 01:10:12,234
Look. It'll be great.
We'll be there alone.

879
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:14,834
It'll be just like the old days.

880
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:23,198
And we'll see if you really
just broke up with me or not.

881
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:24,998
Let's go, honey.

882
01:10:43,080 --> 01:10:44,513
Hey.

883
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:48,876
How you doin'?
Want some wine to warm you up?

884
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:50,359
Sure.

885
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:56,479
Thanks, Stan.

886
01:11:24,760 --> 01:11:28,036
That was nice. Really nice.

887
01:11:29,240 --> 01:11:32,676
Less intense and emotionally
possessed than normal,

888
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:36,753
but no less effective because
of its pointless colouration.

889
01:11:36,840 --> 01:11:38,398
Excuse me?

890
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:42,758
My teacher's exact comment after
my first recital - Rhapsody In Blue.

891
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:44,910
When in doubt, go Gershwin.

892
01:11:45,680 --> 01:11:47,238
You drunk?

893
01:11:48,680 --> 01:11:51,148
I don't know
but you both look beautiful.

894
01:11:53,240 --> 01:11:54,798
So why the sad face?

895
01:11:56,320 --> 01:12:00,472
Job requirement.
Happy piano players work the circus.

896
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:03,870
I think you Knight's Ridge boys
take the ladies way too seriously.

897
01:12:03,960 --> 01:12:05,996
Only until baseball season starts.

898
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:10,358
Pitchers and catchers report in
two months, three weeks and six days.

899
01:12:12,720 --> 01:12:15,439
- Wanna go home with me?
- No.

900
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:20,469
OK, I had to ask. To be honest,
I don't find you at all attractive.

901
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:22,152
- Really?
- Really.

902
01:12:22,240 --> 01:12:25,869
- So now you wanna go home with me?
- No.

903
01:12:25,960 --> 01:12:29,350
- Well, I tried every angle.
- Job requirement.

904
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:31,351
Exactly.

905
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:34,392
Play something else.

906
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:37,597
You don't like this boozy,
after-hours musician banter?

907
01:12:37,680 --> 01:12:39,989
Can't dance to it.

908
01:12:40,840 --> 01:12:42,910
You'd be surprised.

909
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:49,389
OK, you've spurned
both my sexual advances,

910
01:12:49,480 --> 01:12:54,110
my attempts at conversation, so I'm
gonna reach into my bag of tricks...

911
01:12:56,600 --> 01:12:59,876
- Wanna go ice fishing?
- I'd love to.

912
01:13:01,320 --> 01:13:02,389
Great.

913
01:13:05,160 --> 01:13:09,631
You know how it is at the beginnings
when you first fall in love?

914
01:13:09,720 --> 01:13:12,075
You can't eat. You can't sleep.

915
01:13:12,160 --> 01:13:17,393
Getting a call from her makes your
day, like seeing a shooting star.

916
01:13:17,480 --> 01:13:22,235
- It's the best.
- But inevitably, it goes away.

917
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:24,834
So, this is my thing, you see.

918
01:13:24,920 --> 01:13:29,357
Why get married now? Why not have
two, three more of those beginnings

919
01:13:29,440 --> 01:13:32,398
before I settle into the big fade?

920
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:36,189
The big fade?
That's an awful way to put it.

921
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:41,796
- She's coming tomorrow.
- That's obvious.

922
01:13:41,880 --> 01:13:46,635
I got no feeling about that. I got a
feeling of overwhelming ambivalence.

923
01:13:46,720 --> 01:13:50,918
But I would rather dread her arrival
than not give a shit.

924
01:13:53,320 --> 01:13:58,474
It's amazing that there's a guy
that gets to do things with you.

925
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:01,791
He gets to make you happy,
spend evenings with you...

926
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:04,269
Make me martinis,
listen to Van Morrison...

927
01:14:04,360 --> 01:14:07,636
- Smell your skin...
...after a day at the beach.

928
01:14:07,720 --> 01:14:11,030
- And read the papers...
...on a Sunday morning.

929
01:14:11,120 --> 01:14:15,318
A rainy Sunday morning. And pepper
your belly with baby kisses.

930
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:19,638
Sorry...

931
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:25,832
There's a guy out there that
thinks the same thing about Tracy.

932
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:31,037
He's jealous of you,
you getting to do all that with her.

933
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:38,472
Can you think of anything better than
making love to an attractive stranger

934
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:42,473
on a frozen lake with
just an oil light to guide your way?

935
01:14:43,160 --> 01:14:45,515
Can you think of anything better?

936
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:47,670
Going back to Chicago.

937
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:52,151
Ice-cold martini. Van Morrison.

938
01:14:54,600 --> 01:14:56,397
Sunday papers. Got you.

939
01:14:58,520 --> 01:14:59,873
I gotta go.

940
01:15:04,280 --> 01:15:05,633
Hey.

941
01:15:06,680 --> 01:15:09,148
Why do I feel
like I'll never see you again?

942
01:15:10,160 --> 01:15:12,276
You'll see me again, Willie.

943
01:15:20,920 --> 01:15:22,273
Damn.

944
01:15:53,640 --> 01:15:55,312
Hi.

945
01:16:07,880 --> 01:16:09,359
You look awful.

946
01:16:10,440 --> 01:16:13,750
- I've been drunk for two weeks.
- Nice.

947
01:16:15,640 --> 01:16:20,111
- How was it, the drive?
- The roads were awful. Sheet ice.

948
01:16:20,200 --> 01:16:22,191
You got here safe.
I'll make you some tea.

949
01:16:28,160 --> 01:16:32,153
That was delicious.
Really superb, Tracy.

950
01:16:32,240 --> 01:16:34,629
- Thank you.
- The fact that you can cook,

951
01:16:34,720 --> 01:16:37,553
rolled into the fact
that you're a successful lawyer

952
01:16:37,640 --> 01:16:41,792
and the fact that you are stunning
to look at, just makes me insane.

953
01:16:44,040 --> 01:16:45,553
Bobby!

954
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:48,392
I'm flattered, Bobby.

955
01:16:49,880 --> 01:16:51,836
It really was superb, Tracy.

956
01:16:53,640 --> 01:16:56,757
- All right, we're gonna shower...
- Why?

957
01:16:56,840 --> 01:17:00,037
We're going over to Mo's
for a pre-bash thing. Why?

958
01:17:00,120 --> 01:17:02,588
You want to shower first or should I?

959
01:17:02,680 --> 01:17:06,036
Why don't you shower first, Will?

960
01:17:06,120 --> 01:17:09,829
We can take the rest
of the time to bond.

961
01:17:09,920 --> 01:17:13,196
- Go ahead. I'll be fine.
- Superb.

962
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:16,438
It really was superb, Tracy.

963
01:17:35,640 --> 01:17:36,629
Hey!

964
01:17:40,760 --> 01:17:43,513
Romeo And Juliet,
the dyslexic version.

965
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:48,675
- What are you doing?
- Another exciting Saturday night.

966
01:17:48,760 --> 01:17:51,911
You got many exciting Saturday nights
in your future.

967
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,355
Yeah. Yeah.

968
01:17:57,040 --> 01:18:00,396
- So your lady's here, huh?
- Yeah.

969
01:18:02,240 --> 01:18:06,472
I saw her. She's really pretty.

970
01:18:07,160 --> 01:18:11,199
She's OK. She's not as pretty
as you, though.

971
01:18:12,080 --> 01:18:14,594
Got that boob thing
going for her, though.

972
01:18:14,680 --> 01:18:17,752
And she can get into R-rated movies.

973
01:18:18,840 --> 01:18:23,675
Two words not in her vocabulary -
"lunch money".

974
01:18:32,200 --> 01:18:34,031
Hey, Marty.

975
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:41,988
I hope we stay in touch.

976
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:48,155
Cos I hope to learn
someday about what you're doing.

977
01:18:48,240 --> 01:18:52,438
Cos I think whatever it is,
it'll be amazing.

978
01:18:54,720 --> 01:18:56,278
I really do.

979
01:18:58,280 --> 01:18:59,633
Thank you.

980
01:18:59,720 --> 01:19:01,358
You got it.

981
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:17,952
- It was great.
- I'm glad you enjoyed it.

982
01:19:18,040 --> 01:19:22,158
- Thank you for coming.
- Trace, we gotta get going.

983
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:24,999
Bye.

984
01:19:27,320 --> 01:19:31,632
- Take care, now. Be careful!
- Stay warm, guys.

985
01:19:33,160 --> 01:19:34,639
Bye.

986
01:19:41,080 --> 01:19:44,789
It's unbelievable. They haven't liked
anyone since Steve McQueen died.

987
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:48,031
- You just...
- They're nice.

988
01:19:48,120 --> 01:19:51,954
Nice. They're as far away
from nice as...

989
01:19:52,040 --> 01:19:55,032
If nice is London, they are Tokyo.

990
01:19:55,120 --> 01:19:56,792
OK.

991
01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:00,836
You're nice.

992
01:20:12,280 --> 01:20:13,952
I can't believe you're not gonna go.

993
01:20:14,040 --> 01:20:16,395
I'm laying low. You have fun.

994
01:20:16,480 --> 01:20:20,109
You loved high school. Everybody's
gonna wonder what happened.

995
01:20:20,200 --> 01:20:22,873
So tell them I'm in Geneva,

996
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:26,589
doing my presentation
on sub-zero water removal.

997
01:20:26,680 --> 01:20:29,114
You just wanna sit here like a loser.

998
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:32,988
Channel 38's showing
Rich Man, Poor Man - all 12 parts.

999
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:40,155
- No shit?
- Back to back.

1000
01:20:40,240 --> 01:20:43,676
Holy shit. Fuck!

1001
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:46,068
Fuck!

1002
01:20:46,160 --> 01:20:50,995
364 nights a year I do dick.
The one night I decide to go out...

1003
01:20:51,080 --> 01:20:53,275
You gotta tape it for me.

1004
01:20:53,360 --> 01:20:55,715
- Can't do it.
- Why not?

1005
01:20:55,800 --> 01:20:58,155
You can't tape Rich Man, Poor Man.

1006
01:20:58,240 --> 01:21:02,074
You gotta watch it with the
commercials just like everybody else.

1007
01:21:03,480 --> 01:21:05,118
That's a good point.

1008
01:21:05,200 --> 01:21:07,350
Falcon Eddie.

1009
01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:11,831
Man, was there ever a more terrifying
screen villain than Falcon Eddie?

1010
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:13,069
No.

1011
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:18,115
- You're gonna watch it?
- Yep.

1012
01:21:18,200 --> 01:21:20,475
- All 12 parts?
- Back to back.

1013
01:21:23,400 --> 01:21:24,879
Shit.

1014
01:21:25,960 --> 01:21:29,748
It's a tough call. You're a bastard.

1015
01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:31,034
Yep.

1016
01:21:34,440 --> 01:21:35,793
Oh, shit...

1017
01:21:40,840 --> 01:21:42,796
Don't drink too much punch.

1018
01:21:55,120 --> 01:21:57,076
Stanley, you kill me.

1019
01:21:57,160 --> 01:22:01,472
- How does that work?
- That's not what I practise...

1020
01:22:01,560 --> 01:22:04,074
- You want some more?
- Yeah.

1021
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:07,391
Tracy. Hey, Paul. You good?

1022
01:22:07,480 --> 01:22:10,392
So, listen... I like this.

1023
01:22:10,480 --> 01:22:12,311
She makes those herself.

1024
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:14,675
Mohammed, one white wine, please.

1025
01:22:14,760 --> 01:22:18,639
- Willie, she is delightful.
- Delightful? Are you Rex Harrison?

1026
01:22:18,720 --> 01:22:21,393
She's amazing.
What is your malfunction?

1027
01:22:21,480 --> 01:22:26,031
She's smart, she's funny,
she's got a great ass, nice rack...

1028
01:22:26,120 --> 01:22:29,237
- Nice rack.
- She's charming, rich, great ass...

1029
01:22:29,320 --> 01:22:32,232
- You mentioned that.
- It's that good, Will.

1030
01:22:36,240 --> 01:22:38,595
- Hey, Frank?
- Hey, Tommy.

1031
01:22:38,680 --> 01:22:41,478
- Get a Bud?
- Sure.

1032
01:22:58,400 --> 01:23:02,632
- You're beautiful.
- Always room for improvement.

1033
01:23:02,720 --> 01:23:06,030
Do you know who you look like?
Ally Sheedy.

1034
01:23:06,120 --> 01:23:09,396
Do you know Ally Sheedy?
Whatever happened to her?

1035
01:23:09,480 --> 01:23:12,677
She was in The Breakfast Club
with the Estevez brothers.

1036
01:23:12,760 --> 01:23:15,593
- That's right.
- I've never seen her since.

1037
01:23:15,680 --> 01:23:18,797
- Did you ever see Misery?
- No.

1038
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:24,000
- Cos you remind me of Kathy Bates.
- Oh, don't you say that!

1039
01:23:24,080 --> 01:23:27,789
Did you hear Andera
went back to Chicago?

1040
01:23:27,880 --> 01:23:31,270
She was supposed to stay
for the reunion, but she just left.

1041
01:23:31,360 --> 01:23:33,078
Really?

1042
01:23:34,160 --> 01:23:36,993
What did you do to her in that shack?

1043
01:23:37,080 --> 01:23:39,913
I told you, we just talked.

1044
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:43,834
- You told her things, didn't you?
- What things?

1045
01:23:43,920 --> 01:23:48,072
- You let her behind the curtain.
- Maybe she missed her boyfriend.

1046
01:23:48,160 --> 01:23:50,879
You let her
behind the curtain. I know.

1047
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:52,598
Never let 'em behind, Will.

1048
01:23:52,680 --> 01:23:57,356
You never let them see the old man
working the levers of the great Oz.

1049
01:23:57,440 --> 01:24:00,671
They're all sisters, Willie.
They aren't allowed back there.

1050
01:24:00,760 --> 01:24:02,352
They mustn't see.

1051
01:24:05,120 --> 01:24:10,069
Tell me the truth. You stay up nights
thinking about this shit?

1052
01:24:10,160 --> 01:24:12,674
You say it like it's a bad thing.

1053
01:24:33,480 --> 01:24:35,516
Hi, Darian. Good to see you.

1054
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:36,919
Susan.

1055
01:24:39,320 --> 01:24:42,153
...and your last name?
- Smalls.

1056
01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:48,957
Say, didn't you used to be
Darian Smalls?

1057
01:24:49,040 --> 01:24:53,352
- That's right.
- I'm Peter Gropeman. Remember me?

1058
01:24:53,440 --> 01:24:54,759
No.

1059
01:24:55,560 --> 01:24:59,599
I used to have a weight problem.
You called me Peter the Eater.

1060
01:24:59,680 --> 01:25:03,719
- You made me cry in seventh grade.
- I did?

1061
01:25:03,800 --> 01:25:05,552
I'm sorry.

1062
01:25:05,640 --> 01:25:07,835
You here alone?

1063
01:25:10,600 --> 01:25:15,435
- Yeah, I guess I am.
- That's weird. Darian Smalls alone.

1064
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:17,715
God you were something
in those days.

1065
01:25:17,800 --> 01:25:19,756
You were beautiful.

1066
01:25:20,840 --> 01:25:24,116
But if you don't mind me saying,
mean as a snake.

1067
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:27,716
You were as mean as a snake.

1068
01:25:45,120 --> 01:25:47,680
Hello, Tom.

1069
01:25:47,760 --> 01:25:49,273
Steve.

1070
01:25:49,360 --> 01:25:52,318
How come you're not at the reunion?

1071
01:25:52,400 --> 01:25:56,154
- Wasn't into it.
- Won't Darian be disappointed?

1072
01:25:58,600 --> 01:26:00,556
- Did she go?
- Yeah.

1073
01:26:00,640 --> 01:26:03,757
- That's nice.
- Can I buy you a drink?

1074
01:26:04,840 --> 01:26:08,549
- No, I got one.
- Come on, Tom. One drink.

1075
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:11,393
I was just gonna be leaving.

1076
01:26:11,480 --> 01:26:13,232
OK.

1077
01:26:14,040 --> 01:26:17,032
Let me see if I got this straight.

1078
01:26:17,120 --> 01:26:21,910
I can't buy you a drink, but you can
stick your dick into my wife.

1079
01:26:24,400 --> 01:26:27,472
- Frank, shot of rye.
- Two.

1080
01:26:30,640 --> 01:26:33,234
See, I think it's Knight's Ridge.

1081
01:26:33,320 --> 01:26:36,073
Fucking working-class towns, man.

1082
01:26:36,160 --> 01:26:38,879
Girls here see a tool belt,
they get moist.

1083
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:42,316
I got an extra one
I can lend you, Steve.

1084
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:45,949
Hook you up
with some vice grips, ratchet...

1085
01:26:46,040 --> 01:26:48,952
Don't fuck with me, man.

1086
01:26:50,840 --> 01:26:54,594
Don't worry about them, either.
This is me and you.

1087
01:26:54,680 --> 01:26:57,797
You know, I don't think it is, Steve.

1088
01:26:57,880 --> 01:27:02,556
You don't strike me as the type
who fights his own battles,

1089
01:27:02,640 --> 01:27:05,473
but I give you
the benefit of the doubt.

1090
01:27:07,200 --> 01:27:12,832
I tell you what. Drink your shot,
go back to your boys,

1091
01:27:12,920 --> 01:27:17,994
play quarters, whatever you frat boys
do and I'll get out of your hair.

1092
01:27:18,080 --> 01:27:20,071
Thanks, Frank.

1093
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:45,311
- You couldn't leave it alone.
- That's right, mother...

1094
01:28:14,960 --> 01:28:16,791
Fuck. You.

1095
01:28:25,360 --> 01:28:28,158
- Let's go.
- Fuckin' lowlife.

1096
01:28:28,240 --> 01:28:30,037
Fuckin' showed him.

1097
01:28:39,960 --> 01:28:41,029
Shit!

1098
01:28:41,120 --> 01:28:42,997
- Michael!
- What?

1099
01:28:43,080 --> 01:28:47,551
Frank just called.
Tommy got the shit kicked out of him.

1100
01:28:47,640 --> 01:28:49,392
- By who?
- Let's go.

1101
01:28:49,480 --> 01:28:54,190
- I don't think you should.
- Sarah, not now, OK? Come on.

1102
01:28:54,280 --> 01:28:56,874
I'm goin'. Come on.

1103
01:28:59,080 --> 01:29:02,152
- Will? Willie?
- Go.

1104
01:29:17,200 --> 01:29:20,636
- Where is he?
- He didn't want me to call the cops.

1105
01:29:21,720 --> 01:29:23,517
Thanks.

1106
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:27,478
- Who the fuck did this?
- Calm down, Mo.

1107
01:29:27,560 --> 01:29:29,869
Frank, who did this?

1108
01:29:29,960 --> 01:29:32,349
Rossmore. He and his buddies.

1109
01:29:32,440 --> 01:29:34,749
- Where are you goin'?
- To find Rossmore.

1110
01:29:34,840 --> 01:29:39,595
- Suddenly, he's Charles Bronson.
- Get him to a hospital. Come on.

1111
01:29:49,320 --> 01:29:53,552
It's snowing. I can't believe
I'm gonna have to plough tonight.

1112
01:29:54,880 --> 01:29:56,916
Tommy was sleeping with his wife.

1113
01:29:58,440 --> 01:29:59,873
So?

1114
01:30:01,440 --> 01:30:03,715
It's not like he was that innocent.

1115
01:30:03,800 --> 01:30:06,758
So he deserved that?
You see his face?

1116
01:30:06,840 --> 01:30:09,673
Look, this does present
a moral dilemma.

1117
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:18,072
All right, fuck him.
Let's lynch the bastard.

1118
01:30:38,520 --> 01:30:40,476
You got a plan?

1119
01:30:44,160 --> 01:30:45,479
No plan.

1120
01:30:45,560 --> 01:30:48,552
- Think he's here?
- I don't know.

1121
01:30:49,200 --> 01:30:52,033
- Fucking douchebag, man.
- Easy, Mo.

1122
01:30:52,120 --> 01:30:54,076
Take it easy.

1123
01:30:54,600 --> 01:30:58,149
You fuck with my friend,
you fuck with me!

1124
01:30:58,240 --> 01:31:02,791
Beat up my friend, you beat up me!
You fuck with me, you fuck with you!

1125
01:31:02,880 --> 01:31:05,678
You get mad when you drink,
you don't drink!

1126
01:31:06,920 --> 01:31:09,912
- What are you talking about?
- Don't talk back.

1127
01:31:12,680 --> 01:31:14,636
- What?
- We got company.

1128
01:31:15,560 --> 01:31:18,791
The cavalry has arrived. Assholes.

1129
01:31:31,960 --> 01:31:33,916
Car trouble, fellas?

1130
01:31:36,560 --> 01:31:38,516
I didn't even see you!

1131
01:31:43,160 --> 01:31:46,311
Now, where were we, shithead?

1132
01:31:51,320 --> 01:31:53,436
Daddy, what's going on?

1133
01:31:57,720 --> 01:32:01,474
I'm just trying to save
my family here, man, all right?

1134
01:32:10,960 --> 01:32:14,475
- Just stay away from us, Stevie.
- Come on.

1135
01:32:16,760 --> 01:32:19,957
Hey, darlin', just go back inside.
I'll be right in.

1136
01:32:20,040 --> 01:32:21,678
OK.

1137
01:32:31,160 --> 01:32:34,118
- All right?
- Yeah, let's get outta here.

1138
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,958
Fuckin' kids comin' out and shit...

1139
01:32:41,040 --> 01:32:43,600
- What did you say?
- Just babbling.

1140
01:32:43,680 --> 01:32:45,238
See you, fellas.

1141
01:33:18,200 --> 01:33:20,509
- How is he?
- I don't know.

1142
01:33:20,600 --> 01:33:24,149
- What did they say?
- They didn't say nothin'.

1143
01:33:25,040 --> 01:33:28,112
- How are you?
- You guys do your macho things?

1144
01:33:28,200 --> 01:33:32,079
We just went over
and Mo pushed him around a bit.

1145
01:33:35,960 --> 01:33:42,149
- Did you tell Annie we'd be late?
- Yeah. I told her to sleep over.

1146
01:33:42,240 --> 01:33:46,756
- That was good.
- You OK?

1147
01:33:46,840 --> 01:33:48,558
Yeah.

1148
01:33:48,640 --> 01:33:51,200
- I'm sorry.
- Just don't...

1149
01:33:51,280 --> 01:33:53,236
- I'm sorry.
- I know.

1150
01:33:54,960 --> 01:33:56,632
I love you, baby.

1151
01:33:56,720 --> 01:33:59,518
Miss, would you check
on room 309, please?

1152
01:33:59,600 --> 01:34:02,398
- You haven't heard anything?
- Here we go.

1153
01:34:03,240 --> 01:34:05,708
- Who called her?
- I don't know.

1154
01:34:05,800 --> 01:34:07,950
Who do you think? Me.

1155
01:34:08,040 --> 01:34:11,476
- What's up?
- He's gonna be OK.

1156
01:34:11,560 --> 01:34:15,872
He has a concussion, two broken ribs
and took about 30 stitches.

1157
01:34:15,960 --> 01:34:19,396
- But he's gonna be OK?
- Yeah. He's gonna be fine.

1158
01:34:19,480 --> 01:34:22,040
He said it's snowing
and that somebody should...

1159
01:34:22,120 --> 01:34:24,793
...sand his lots. Got it.

1160
01:34:24,880 --> 01:34:26,871
Go get 'em, Kev.

1161
01:34:26,960 --> 01:34:32,159
- I'll be by tomorrow to say goodbye.
- Wait. Where are you goin'?

1162
01:34:32,240 --> 01:34:34,231
We're going back tomorrow.

1163
01:34:34,320 --> 01:34:36,470
- Just like that?
- Just like that.

1164
01:34:44,760 --> 01:34:46,432
Is the couch OK?

1165
01:34:46,520 --> 01:34:49,557
Yeah, yeah. It's fine.

1166
01:34:50,800 --> 01:34:52,870
Sorry about tonight.

1167
01:34:52,960 --> 01:34:54,712
- I had fun.
- Yeah?

1168
01:34:54,800 --> 01:34:58,031
It's pretty lively around here.

1169
01:34:58,120 --> 01:35:00,998
So how come
you're coming back with me?

1170
01:35:01,080 --> 01:35:04,038
I don't know. Cos I want to.

1171
01:35:07,240 --> 01:35:11,711
- I'm not gonna take that sales job.
- I don't think you should.

1172
01:35:11,800 --> 01:35:15,918
- How come?
- Piano players are sexy.

1173
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,992
Salesmen are uncles.

1174
01:35:19,080 --> 01:35:21,036
And uncles aren't sexy.

1175
01:35:21,120 --> 01:35:23,031
Not usually.

1176
01:35:31,440 --> 01:35:34,557
Wait, wait. This is so weird.

1177
01:35:34,640 --> 01:35:37,154
You've never had sex in here before?

1178
01:35:37,240 --> 01:35:39,629
Not with another person.

1179
01:35:49,520 --> 01:35:51,317
So...

1180
01:35:53,480 --> 01:35:56,756
So how are you holding up?
Are you in pain?

1181
01:35:56,840 --> 01:35:58,478
I'm OK.

1182
01:36:02,960 --> 01:36:04,951
You look nice.

1183
01:36:05,040 --> 01:36:08,510
Thanks. I was on a date.

1184
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:15,356
- Did you have fun?
- It was OK.

1185
01:36:16,600 --> 01:36:18,352
It's weird.

1186
01:36:20,160 --> 01:36:22,196
What is?

1187
01:36:22,280 --> 01:36:26,910
I'm just lying here
and I'm wondering...

1188
01:36:28,160 --> 01:36:30,196
how I got here, you know?

1189
01:36:31,880 --> 01:36:36,908
I don't mean here,
I mean how I got here...

1190
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:40,117
How I'm not anything like...

1191
01:36:40,200 --> 01:36:43,317
what I'd hoped that I'd be,
you know?

1192
01:36:51,080 --> 01:36:56,154
I'm not even close to the guy
I thought I'd end up being.

1193
01:36:58,800 --> 01:37:01,314
And it kind of blows.

1194
01:37:02,320 --> 01:37:03,992
You know?

1195
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:12,028
When I think about that guy
that I thought I was gonna be...

1196
01:37:15,360 --> 01:37:17,237
there's a...

1197
01:37:18,360 --> 01:37:23,115
there's this girl next to him,
with him...

1198
01:37:25,560 --> 01:37:28,438
and I don't know...

1199
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,116
she looks sorta like you.

1200
01:37:34,520 --> 01:37:37,751
- Sorta?
- Exactly.

1201
01:37:40,520 --> 01:37:42,033
Exactly sorta.

1202
01:38:55,160 --> 01:38:57,310
- Hey.
- Hey.

1203
01:39:00,560 --> 01:39:02,516
You look excellent.

1204
01:39:04,760 --> 01:39:06,637
Did you guys fuck up Rossmore?

1205
01:39:06,720 --> 01:39:11,589
No, we put the fear of God into him.
He was a real shit.

1206
01:39:12,720 --> 01:39:16,838
- He had a right to be pissed.
- How's she doing?

1207
01:39:18,160 --> 01:39:19,513
She's fine.

1208
01:39:19,600 --> 01:39:22,717
Yeah. You're not gonna fuck it up
with her, are you?

1209
01:39:26,040 --> 01:39:27,951
What do you think?

1210
01:39:28,040 --> 01:39:33,034
She's one of the good ones. Why
do we always fuck up the good ones?

1211
01:39:34,520 --> 01:39:37,239
I don't know.
I've been pretty successful at it.

1212
01:39:39,160 --> 01:39:41,913
Listen, I just came by
to say goodbye.

1213
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,719
- I'm taking off.
- Taking off?

1214
01:39:44,800 --> 01:39:47,360
- Yeah.
- All right.

1215
01:39:47,440 --> 01:39:50,512
Listen, maybe
I'll come down and visit.

1216
01:39:50,600 --> 01:39:53,433
Yeah, right. Like, what, spring?

1217
01:39:54,680 --> 01:39:56,671
- Spring.
- Spring.

1218
01:39:57,360 --> 01:39:58,509
Hey.

1219
01:39:58,600 --> 01:40:02,912
- Don't be a stranger.
- All right. Take care of each other.

1220
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:05,150
Right.

1221
01:40:06,040 --> 01:40:09,715
- Surprise!
- Oh, shit!

1222
01:40:11,160 --> 01:40:12,673
- Hey!
- Hey!

1223
01:40:12,760 --> 01:40:16,958
- Tough guy, how you feelin'?
- I've been better. You takin' off?

1224
01:40:17,040 --> 01:40:19,076
Yeah, I'm goin' home.

1225
01:40:19,160 --> 01:40:23,790
- Listen, say goodbye to Sarah.
- Say goodbye to Tracy.

1226
01:40:23,880 --> 01:40:26,269
You figure any of that shit out?

1227
01:40:26,360 --> 01:40:28,510
You know. I'm working on it.

1228
01:40:28,600 --> 01:40:30,591
Good.

1229
01:40:30,680 --> 01:40:33,797
- I better get in there.
- See you soon.

1230
01:40:33,880 --> 01:40:36,474
All right, buddy. I love you, man.

1231
01:40:38,600 --> 01:40:41,273
How you doin', bud?

1232
01:40:49,360 --> 01:40:53,433
- I'm not used to this snow.
- How long is the drive?

1233
01:40:53,520 --> 01:40:56,956
About five or six hours.
If he drives, for sure five...

1234
01:40:58,320 --> 01:41:02,199
- You'll have nice weather.
- It won't be too bad.

1235
01:41:02,280 --> 01:41:04,350
- Here.
- Oh, thank you.

1236
01:41:04,440 --> 01:41:07,113
- Front or back?
- Back is good.

1237
01:41:31,680 --> 01:41:34,319
Word is Jan and Victor
are engaged, Willie.

1238
01:41:34,400 --> 01:41:37,995
- How do you feel?
- She drains me. They're all sisters.

1239
01:41:38,080 --> 01:41:39,513
Each and every one.

1240
01:41:39,600 --> 01:41:41,955
- Yo, Willie boy.
- Hey.

1241
01:41:42,040 --> 01:41:45,112
- So you outta here?
- Yep.

1242
01:41:45,200 --> 01:41:47,236
She is a honey-limbed lovely.

1243
01:41:47,320 --> 01:41:49,117
- Nice meeting you.
- You, too.

1244
01:41:49,200 --> 01:41:51,509
- Have a safe ride.
- Trace.

1245
01:41:52,120 --> 01:41:54,998
This is Marty. Marty, Tracy.

1246
01:41:55,080 --> 01:41:57,833
- Hi, nice to meet you.
- You, too.

1247
01:41:57,920 --> 01:42:01,754
- OK. Take care, big guy.
- Thanks.

1248
01:42:06,360 --> 01:42:08,112
See you.

1249
01:42:12,560 --> 01:42:14,232
- You ready?
- Yeah.

1250
01:42:14,320 --> 01:42:15,673
- Bye.
- Bye.

1251
01:42:21,600 --> 01:42:23,511
Bye, Marty.

1252
01:42:23,600 --> 01:42:25,556
Later, Pooh.

1253
01:42:41,800 --> 01:42:43,870
Come back and see us, Will.

1254
01:42:43,960 --> 01:42:47,589
We'll be right here.
Nothing changes here but the seasons.

1255
01:42:58,760 --> 01:43:01,035
So you're
the little neighbourhood Lolita?

1256
01:43:01,120 --> 01:43:04,908
So you're the alcoholic,
high school buddy shit-for-brains?

1257
01:43:05,200 --> 01:43:08,510
That little girl was cute.
What was her name? Marcy?

1258
01:43:08,600 --> 01:43:10,431
No, no. Marty.

1259
01:43:10,520 --> 01:43:13,239
- Is it Martha?
- No, as in Martin.

1260
01:43:13,320 --> 01:43:16,471
Named after a grandfather
she never even knew.

1261
01:43:20,080 --> 01:43:22,878
- You OK?
- Yeah.

1262
01:43:22,960 --> 01:43:24,757
Yeah, I am.

1263
01:43:24,840 --> 01:43:26,592
Superb.

1264
01:43:37,480 --> 01:43:38,799
Willie C!

1265
01:43:39,720 --> 01:43:41,756
Take care, man.

1266
01:43:41,840 --> 01:43:43,796
Stay cool. Stay cool forever.

1267
01:43:43,880 --> 01:43:45,472
All right, Kev.
