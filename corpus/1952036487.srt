called Troy from Titus last night.

It was some emergency
with the lift.

off out of here

with the money.

you were coming.

as he gets back...

me manager right after Christmas,

28
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:18,289
so I can definitely
make the payments

29

A relative?

1057
01:28:15,973 --> 01:28:17,239
A friend.

1058
01:28:18,275 --> 01:28:20,376
But I need to call my kids.

1059
01:28:29,002 --> 01:28:30,803
Mom, what did you do?

1060
01:28:32,406 --> 01:28:34,374
What? A smuggler?
Holy shit!

1061
01:28:38,579 --> 01:28:40,347
Are you in jail?

1062
01:28:43,083 --> 01:28:45,718
Yeah, but are you
gonna be in jail?

1063
01:28:51,324 --> 01:28:54,594
Yeah, okay. But...
But why? I...

1064
01:28:55,829 --> 01:28:57,296
I can do it. I...

1065
01:28:57,364 --> 01:28:58,598
I look after him
all the time.

1066
01:28:58,665 --> 01:29:00,366
I don't see why we need...

1067
01:29:02,603 --> 01:29:03,669
Yeah, I'm still here.

1068
01:29:03,737 --> 01:29:05,304
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

1069
01:29:13,146 --> 01:29:14,263
Hi.

1070
01:29:16,399 --> 01:29:17,500
Okay.

1071
01:29:28,611 --> 01:29:31,413
Hey, you've got to put the little
pieces up higher or he'll eat them. Okay?

1072
01:29:31,481 --> 01:29:32,548
RICKY: What?

1073
01:29:47,347 --> 01:29:48,881
(BABY GURGLING)

1074
01:30:30,473 --> 01:30:33,375
You got a little boy
named Troy Junior?

1075
01:30:33,443 --> 01:30:34,811
Yeah.

1076
01:30:35,946 --> 01:30:37,046
Troy!

1077
01:30:38,348 --> 01:30:41,250
Would you come here?
I want to talk to you.

1078
01:30:53,863 --> 01:30:56,632
You know, you did a bad
thing to an old lady,

1079
01:30:56,699 --> 01:30:59,068
and I'd like to
introduce her to you

1080
01:30:59,136 --> 01:31:01,870
and give you a chance
to apologize.

1081
01:31:01,939 --> 01:31:03,539
Because I know you're
probably a good kid,

1082
01:31:03,606 --> 01:31:06,042
and I know you want
to set this right.

1083
01:31:06,109 --> 01:31:07,276
Come on.

1084
01:31:08,912 --> 01:31:10,780
Tell her you're sorry.

1085
01:31:13,116 --> 01:31:14,450
Sorry.

1086
01:31:14,902 --> 01:31:16,052
Okay?

1087
01:31:18,154 --> 01:31:20,790
You did good.
Now don't do that again.

1088
01:31:28,232 --> 01:31:30,633
Hey, come here.

1089
01:31:33,871 --> 01:31:35,437
