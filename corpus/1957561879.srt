1
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:15,887
ANDREW: Go to sleep, Katie.

2
00:03:16,013 --> 00:03:18,976
KATIE: You know I can't go
to sleep with the light off.

3
00:03:19,101 --> 00:03:20,937
ANDREW: Try counting sheep.

4
00:03:21,063 --> 00:03:22,649
KATIE: I don't like sheep.

5
00:03:22,774 --> 00:03:24,193
They scare me.

6
00:03:24,318 --> 00:03:25,696
ANDREW: You are so sad.

7
00:03:25,821 --> 00:03:26,573
Stop it.

8
00:03:26,697 --> 00:03:27,574
DAD: OK, you two.

9
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,035
What's all the talking about?

10
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,788
I can't sleep
with the light off.

11
00:03:30,913 --> 00:03:31,664
ANDREW: I could have.

12
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:32,708
All right.

13
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:34,586
Let's, let's just settle down.

14
00:03:34,711 --> 00:03:36,631
I miss mom.

15
00:03:36,757 --> 00:03:38,384
And I think there's
something in the closet.

16
00:03:42,558 --> 00:03:43,435
How about a story?

17
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,813
ANDREW: Could we?

18
00:03:44,937 --> 00:03:45,730
Yeah?

19
00:03:45,856 --> 00:03:46,857
OK.

20
00:03:46,983 --> 00:03:47,860
OK.

21
00:03:51,324 --> 00:03:52,576
Um yeah, how about this one?

22
00:03:52,701 --> 00:03:53,577
Nah.

23
00:03:53,703 --> 00:03:54,955
No?

24
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,376
Oh, this-- this one was
your favorite last year.

25
00:03:57,501 --> 00:03:59,296
You loved-- you don't
love this one anymore.

26
00:03:59,421 --> 00:04:00,631
OK.

27
00:04:00,757 --> 00:04:04,180
Um, well, I've never
seen this one before.

28
00:04:07,226 --> 00:04:08,270
BOTH: Neither have we.

29
00:04:11,233 --> 00:04:12,068
All right then.

30
00:04:12,193 --> 00:04:13,070
Let's try this.

31
00:04:21,376 --> 00:04:22,210
Wow.

32
00:04:24,881 --> 00:04:26,760
Hm.

33
00:04:26,885 --> 00:04:29,640
"Once upon a time,
in a far off land,

34
00:04:29,765 --> 00:04:32,020
there stood a
lowly shack, hardly

35
00:04:32,144 --> 00:04:33,856
fit for an animal to live."

36
00:04:33,981 --> 00:04:35,400
Wait a minute.

37
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:38,530
Don't these stories usually
start with a castle?

38
00:04:38,656 --> 00:04:40,576
Is this a fairy tale?

39
00:04:40,701 --> 00:04:42,287
Let's just give
it a few pages.

40
00:04:42,413 --> 00:04:46,794
There aren't any, uh, sheep,
in any of these fairy tales,

41
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,838
are there?

42
00:04:51,053 --> 00:04:52,930
DAD : "Close
to a large forest,

43
00:04:53,056 --> 00:04:55,434
there lived a woodcutter
and his family.

44
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,106
They were very poor
and had little to eat.

45
00:04:58,231 --> 00:05:00,110
The boy was named Hansel.

46
00:05:00,234 --> 00:05:01,821
The girl, Gretel.

47
00:05:01,946 --> 00:05:04,241
While their father spent
his days searching for food,

48
00:05:04,367 --> 00:05:05,911
the children were
left to the care

49
00:05:06,037 --> 00:05:07,038
of their wicked stepmother."

50
00:05:10,001 --> 00:05:12,673
Rats, eating all my bread.

51
00:05:12,798 --> 00:05:14,677
Well, we all know
what happens to rats.

52
00:05:17,181 --> 00:05:18,725
They get squished.

53
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:23,525
My cheese!

54
00:05:38,718 --> 00:05:40,847
What in the living
daylights is going on?

55
00:05:40,973 --> 00:05:41,765
BOTH: Father!

56
00:05:44,645 --> 00:05:46,106
BRUNHILDA: We have
rats in the house.

57
00:05:46,231 --> 00:05:47,024
Rats?

58
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:48,068
Yes.

59
00:05:48,193 --> 00:05:49,613
Huge rats.

60
00:05:49,737 --> 00:05:54,161
And they ate a week's worth
of bread and my cheese.

61
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:59,129
We had cheese and a
week's worth of bread?

62
00:05:59,254 --> 00:06:02,885
No, just wishful thinking.

63
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:04,346
We never have any food.

64
00:06:05,974 --> 00:06:12,736
Well, tonight, we feast!

65
00:06:12,861 --> 00:06:18,329
Oh, honey--
ferret, my favorite.

66
00:06:18,454 --> 00:06:20,457
I'll just stick it in a
pot, and we'll have stew.

67
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:22,794
GRETEL: Hansel, we're
gonna have hot stew!

68
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:28,179
Now, come and see what I have
gotten for your collection.

69
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:30,057
Ah.

70
00:06:30,183 --> 00:06:31,184
See?

71
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:32,603
Has some quartz in there.

72
00:06:32,729 --> 00:06:33,897
Amazing!

73
00:06:34,023 --> 00:06:35,358
KATIE: Father, what is--
BRUNHILDA: Yummy--

74
00:06:35,483 --> 00:06:36,610
KATIE: --this one called?
BRUNHILDA: Ferret stew.

75
00:06:36,736 --> 00:06:37,696
ANDREW: I've never
seen one like this!

76
00:06:37,821 --> 00:06:38,530
DAD: This one has
some fellspire.

77
00:06:38,656 --> 00:06:40,200
You see how that shines?

78
00:06:40,325 --> 00:06:42,579
That is a jewel for
my little princess.

79
00:06:42,704 --> 00:06:44,750
Oh, thank you, father.

80
00:06:44,874 --> 00:06:46,794
I love you.

81
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,881
If you spent more time looking
for food instead of for rocks,

82
00:06:49,007 --> 00:06:50,634
maybe we wouldn't be starving.

83
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,761
DAD: What was that, Brun?

84
00:06:51,887 --> 00:06:53,431
KATIE: We have so
many rocks now.

85
00:06:53,557 --> 00:06:57,271
Uh, I was just saying what a
rocking good time we're having!

86
00:06:57,397 --> 00:06:58,690
FATHER: Ah, is that so?

87
00:06:58,816 --> 00:07:02,990
Yeah, we were chasing rats.

88
00:07:03,114 --> 00:07:04,576
You're kidding me.

89
00:07:04,701 --> 00:07:07,289
ANDREW: I saw a huge one--
looked just like Broomhilda.

90
00:07:07,414 --> 00:07:09,167
So I whacked it on the head.

91
00:07:09,292 --> 00:07:11,587
BRUNHILDA: Do you see how
they tease and taunt me?

92
00:07:11,713 --> 00:07:14,969
And my name is Brunhilda,
not Broomhilda.

93
00:07:15,094 --> 00:07:17,097
Can't you get that straight?

94
00:07:17,223 --> 00:07:21,480
It just hurts me so.

95
00:07:21,605 --> 00:07:23,191
Hansel, I will
not have you talk

96
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:24,151
that way about your stepmother.

97
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:25,237
Off to bed with you.

98
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:26,238
Go.

99
00:07:32,081 --> 00:07:33,292
And where do you
think you're going?

100
00:07:35,921 --> 00:07:38,176
I'm going too.

101
00:07:38,301 --> 00:07:39,136
Good night, father.

102
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:49,361
Aw, come here, Broom.

103
00:07:49,487 --> 00:07:50,572
I mean, Brun.

104
00:07:50,697 --> 00:07:51,657
I meant to say Brun.

105
00:07:51,783 --> 00:07:52,576
Please.

106
00:07:55,205 --> 00:07:57,834
Come.

107
00:08:04,972 --> 00:08:06,433
I just want them to love me.

108
00:08:06,558 --> 00:08:07,936
And they will, in time.

109
00:08:08,061 --> 00:08:08,770
Yeah?

110
00:08:08,896 --> 00:08:10,106
Yeah.

111
00:08:10,231 --> 00:08:10,941
Yeah?

112
00:08:11,066 --> 00:08:12,110
Yeah.

113
00:08:18,329 --> 00:08:19,038
Oh yeah.

114
00:08:19,163 --> 00:08:20,416
Ew!

115
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:21,459
What's she doing?

116
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:22,419
Gross!

117
00:08:22,544 --> 00:08:24,423
She's juicing him.

118
00:08:24,547 --> 00:08:28,387
The word's seducing, stupid.

119
00:08:28,513 --> 00:08:29,932
Well, it's still gross.

120
00:08:30,057 --> 00:08:32,061
Poor children.

121
00:08:32,186 --> 00:08:33,605
I'll try to be
more understanding.

122
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:34,565
Yeah.

123
00:08:38,154 --> 00:08:39,699
Hm.

124
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,456
Goodnight, Hansel.

125
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:08,583
Goodnight, Gretel.

126
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:20,937
I have been thinking
about what you said.

127
00:09:21,063 --> 00:09:22,231
Oh?

128
00:09:22,356 --> 00:09:24,067
What's that?

129
00:09:24,193 --> 00:09:29,911
Oh, I can't stand us
living this way any longer.

130
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:32,916
I will sell the necklace.

131
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:35,671
This is not the life I
promised you and the children.

132
00:09:38,593 --> 00:09:41,681
I will head for
the city tomorrow.

133
00:09:41,807 --> 00:09:45,814
Well, if that's
what you've decided,

134
00:09:45,939 --> 00:09:48,234
honey, then you should tell
the children right away.

135
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,278
Yeah, yeah.

136
00:10:22,711 --> 00:10:23,796
ANDREW: This is dumb.

137
00:10:23,921 --> 00:10:24,840
Is not.

138
00:10:24,964 --> 00:10:26,426
Yeah, it is.

139
00:10:26,551 --> 00:10:30,892
A real fairy tale has trolls
and witches and boogymen.

140
00:10:33,438 --> 00:10:35,233
You wouldn't sell
any of mommy's things,

141
00:10:35,358 --> 00:10:36,109
would you, daddy?

142
00:10:36,234 --> 00:10:36,986
No, honey.

143
00:10:37,111 --> 00:10:38,614
No, I wouldn't.

144
00:10:38,739 --> 00:10:40,659
But I don't think Hansel and
Gretel's dad had a choice,

145
00:10:40,784 --> 00:10:41,494
you know?

146
00:10:41,619 --> 00:10:42,871
They were starving.

147
00:10:42,996 --> 00:10:45,334
Maybe they could each
other, like cannibals.

148
00:10:45,459 --> 00:10:46,377
That's enough, Andrew.

149
00:10:55,184 --> 00:10:56,019
How are the children?

150
00:10:58,273 --> 00:10:59,107
Upset.

151
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:02,989
Well, the money
the locket brings

152
00:11:03,114 --> 00:11:05,869
us will buy us food and
supplies to last a whole year.

153
00:11:08,874 --> 00:11:09,709
Yeah, yeah.

154
00:11:14,634 --> 00:11:15,386
I'll just--

155
00:11:17,056 --> 00:11:18,809
--polish and pack
it for the journey.

156
00:11:18,933 --> 00:11:21,063
It should look its very
best for the jewelers.

157
00:11:23,567 --> 00:11:25,570
That is very
thoughtful of you.

158
00:11:25,696 --> 00:11:26,989
I'm a very thoughtful girl.

159
00:11:28,784 --> 00:11:30,370
FATHER: I will have to
leave before sunrise.

160
00:11:41,139 --> 00:11:44,269
Time for bed.

161
00:12:26,717 --> 00:12:28,096
It's show time!

162
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:29,973
We're going for a
walk into the woods.

163
00:12:30,099 --> 00:12:31,893
A very long walk.

164
00:12:32,019 --> 00:12:32,979
Count me out.

165
00:12:33,104 --> 00:12:33,939
Me too.

166
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,779
I wasn't axing you.

167
00:12:37,904 --> 00:12:40,200
I'm telling you.

168
00:12:40,324 --> 00:12:41,702
Chop, chop!

169
00:12:41,827 --> 00:12:42,620
Yes, Brun.

170
00:12:45,626 --> 00:12:46,627
Is she gonna chop us up?

171
00:12:46,753 --> 00:12:48,213
No, she's not that dumb.

172
00:12:48,339 --> 00:12:50,050
She's going to take us into
the forest and lose us.

173
00:12:50,176 --> 00:12:52,471
But don't worry,
I've got a plan.

174
00:12:52,596 --> 00:12:54,307
It's called, let's
get out of here!

175
00:12:57,604 --> 00:12:59,191
I don't think so.

176
00:12:59,316 --> 00:13:01,612
If you hate us so much, then
why did you marry our father?

177
00:13:01,737 --> 00:13:03,616
One very good reason.

178
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:07,664
One 22-carat, fine
filigree reason.

179
00:13:07,789 --> 00:13:08,957
That's our mother's!

180
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:10,419
Not anymore.

181
00:13:10,544 --> 00:13:12,506
But father said he was
taking it to town to sell.

182
00:13:12,631 --> 00:13:15,720
Your idiot father is carrying
a neatly packaged pebble.

183
00:13:15,844 --> 00:13:18,099
And with the money this
fine necklace brings,

184
00:13:18,224 --> 00:13:20,520
I can finally live the
kind of life I deserve.

185
00:13:20,644 --> 00:13:21,772
Our father will find you.

186
00:13:21,897 --> 00:13:23,900
Then you'll be sorry!

187
00:13:24,026 --> 00:13:25,612
Not!

188
00:13:25,737 --> 00:13:27,782
He'll be too busy searching
for his little lost children.

189
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:35,003
Lessens the value,
you understand.

190
00:13:35,129 --> 00:13:36,004
No!

191
00:13:58,377 --> 00:14:01,800
DAD : "Deeper
and deeper and deeper

192
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:04,012
into the forest she led them.

193
00:14:04,137 --> 00:14:06,016
Hansel, always a
boy with a plan,

194
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:07,726
secretly marked the pathway.

195
00:14:07,852 --> 00:14:11,609
Otherwise, they would never be
able to find their way home."

196
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,307
Do we have a problem?

197
00:14:30,433 --> 00:14:33,187
Hm?

198
00:14:33,313 --> 00:14:35,650
No way I'm going in there.

199
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:38,989
Don't worry, we'll
find our way back.

200
00:14:39,114 --> 00:14:41,827
My rock collection, remember?

201
00:14:41,953 --> 00:14:44,624
Oh, by the way, you
might want to bring these.

202
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:48,172
I know.

203
00:14:48,297 --> 00:14:50,509
I even amaze myself sometimes.

204
00:14:50,634 --> 00:14:52,179
Now, off with you.

205
00:14:52,304 --> 00:14:54,892
Go, go, go.

206
00:14:57,437 --> 00:14:58,314
Oh.

207
00:15:01,444 --> 00:15:02,780
ANDREW: Let's just wait
here until she's gone.

208
00:15:06,662 --> 00:15:07,914
Hm.

209
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:21,187
See?

210
00:15:21,313 --> 00:15:22,857
It's not so bad.

211
00:15:22,982 --> 00:15:26,489
Nothing here but fog.

212
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:35,754
Boo!

213
00:15:35,879 --> 00:15:39,302
Run, Gretel!

214
00:15:39,427 --> 00:15:41,347
Just think of
it as a sleepover.

215
00:15:41,473 --> 00:15:44,561
Only you'll be staying
over and over and over.

216
00:15:57,124 --> 00:15:58,460
What now?

217
00:15:58,586 --> 00:16:00,422
Now we get out of the
forest, head to the city,

218
00:16:00,547 --> 00:16:02,926
and find father.

219
00:16:03,052 --> 00:16:03,970
This way.

220
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:04,930
Wait!

221
00:16:11,149 --> 00:16:12,234
We're lost, aren't we?

222
00:16:16,492 --> 00:16:19,372
I'm so tired and hungry.

223
00:16:19,497 --> 00:16:20,332
Just try to stay calm.

224
00:16:20,457 --> 00:16:22,919
OK, Gretel?

225
00:16:34,397 --> 00:16:39,406
By the twitching of my nose,
something tasty this way comes.

226
00:16:53,723 --> 00:16:54,683
What is it?

227
00:16:54,808 --> 00:16:55,643
I don't know.

228
00:16:55,768 --> 00:16:56,770
What is it?

229
00:16:56,895 --> 00:16:58,147
I don't know.

230
00:16:58,273 --> 00:16:59,900
Well, if you give me
a chance, I'll tell you.

231
00:17:00,026 --> 00:17:01,903
Sorry, I just got
caught up in the moment.

232
00:17:02,029 --> 00:17:03,073
ANDREW: You're scared.

233
00:17:03,197 --> 00:17:04,033
I am not.

234
00:17:08,206 --> 00:17:09,876
Honey, are you sure?

235
00:17:10,001 --> 00:17:11,796
Are you ready for this?

236
00:17:11,921 --> 00:17:14,634
I mean, are you
really ready for it?

237
00:17:14,759 --> 00:17:18,557
I mean, are you really,
really ready for it?

238
00:17:18,683 --> 00:17:20,519
Well, what is it?

239
00:17:20,644 --> 00:17:22,022
It is a boogeyman!

240
00:17:28,742 --> 00:17:30,703
It's getting a little too
noisy in the neighborhood.

241
00:17:30,829 --> 00:17:32,457
The owner's association is
getting a letter from me.

242
00:17:32,582 --> 00:17:34,210
If it's not the
birds squawking, it's

243
00:17:34,335 --> 00:17:35,462
the squirrels chattering, or--

244
00:17:35,587 --> 00:17:36,339
Yo, baldy.

245
00:17:36,463 --> 00:17:40,012
I'm working here, huh?

246
00:17:40,137 --> 00:17:41,013
What are you doing here?

247
00:17:41,139 --> 00:17:42,724
This is my part of the forest.

248
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:44,436
You're not supposed to be here.

249
00:17:44,561 --> 00:17:47,650
Hit the road, Jack, and don't
you come back no more, no more.

250
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,027
Well, well.

251
00:17:49,152 --> 00:17:52,659
If it isn't the Sandman,
the sultan of snooze,

252
00:17:52,783 --> 00:17:54,662
the bearer of bedtime.

253
00:17:54,787 --> 00:17:56,957
Well, at least what
I do is important!

254
00:17:57,083 --> 00:17:59,754
What kind of job is lurking
around in closets, scaring

255
00:17:59,879 --> 00:18:01,466
kids out of their pajamas?

256
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:03,928
It's a fun job.

257
00:18:04,053 --> 00:18:05,263
Oh, ooh.

258
00:18:05,389 --> 00:18:06,557
You know there's, um,
you have a little--

259
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:09,730
Uh, tissue!

260
00:18:09,855 --> 00:18:10,606
You know what?

261
00:18:10,732 --> 00:18:11,859
Not my concern.

262
00:18:11,983 --> 00:18:12,777
Ha, ha.

263
00:18:12,902 --> 00:18:14,488
Very funny.

264
00:18:14,613 --> 00:18:16,616
You know, I'd love to stay and
chat, but I've got a hot date.

265
00:18:16,742 --> 00:18:18,036
Maybe you know her?

266
00:18:18,161 --> 00:18:20,749
The wood faerie.

267
00:18:20,874 --> 00:18:23,128
Well, I know enough about her.

268
00:18:23,253 --> 00:18:23,963
What do you mean?

269
00:18:24,088 --> 00:18:25,924
Well, she's a faerie.

270
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:26,926
She's blonde.

271
00:18:27,052 --> 00:18:28,554
Need I say more?

272
00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:30,140
You're just jealous.

273
00:18:30,266 --> 00:18:31,100
Jealous?

274
00:18:31,226 --> 00:18:33,354
Of you?

275
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:35,107
Ha, ha!

276
00:18:35,232 --> 00:18:37,486
You better
believe it, Sandman.

277
00:18:40,533 --> 00:18:46,126
Well, I'd love to stay and
chat, but I've got to go.

278
00:18:46,252 --> 00:18:49,632
I will see you two later.

279
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:55,226
And I'll see you
later too, later.

280
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:02,363
Don't be scared.

281
00:19:02,488 --> 00:19:05,284
His, um, his, uh, fright is
a lot worse than his frown.

282
00:19:07,956 --> 00:19:09,626
You're not really
the Sandman, are you?

283
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,754
Absolutely.

284
00:19:11,879 --> 00:19:13,132
I'm the Sandman.

285
00:19:13,256 --> 00:19:14,092
And you live here?

286
00:19:14,216 --> 00:19:15,510
Of course.

287
00:19:15,636 --> 00:19:17,472
Where else would
I live, New York?

288
00:19:17,597 --> 00:19:18,933
The city that never sleeps?

289
00:19:20,227 --> 00:19:22,063
I don't think so.

290
00:19:22,189 --> 00:19:24,026
Though I was looking
at a timeshare.

291
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:25,779
I wasn't really
interested in it,

292
00:19:25,903 --> 00:19:27,782
but if you just go,
like, look at it,

293
00:19:27,907 --> 00:19:29,326
they give you a clock radio.

294
00:19:29,452 --> 00:19:31,539
That was nice.

295
00:19:31,663 --> 00:19:33,500
So, this must be
your sleep dust.

296
00:19:33,625 --> 00:19:34,376
Whoa, whoa.

297
00:19:34,502 --> 00:19:36,004
Back off, shorty.

298
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:39,677
This is very powerful stuff,
only to be handled by highly

299
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:42,640
trained professionals.

300
00:19:42,766 --> 00:19:43,810
And you are?

301
00:19:43,935 --> 00:19:45,354
I'm Hansel, and
this is Gretel.

302
00:19:45,479 --> 00:19:47,065
We're lost.

303
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:49,486
Well, it has been
a rare pleasure,

304
00:19:49,612 --> 00:19:53,326
but I must be going,
because I'm an important guy

305
00:19:53,452 --> 00:19:55,956
with an important job.

306
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,419
Do you mean you're
not going to help us?

307
00:19:58,543 --> 00:19:59,503
Uh--

308
00:19:59,629 --> 00:20:00,463
We're lost.

309
00:20:00,589 --> 00:20:01,465
You live here.

310
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:02,717
GRETEL: We must find our father.

311
00:20:02,843 --> 00:20:04,012
You can help us get out.

312
00:20:04,136 --> 00:20:05,430
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

313
00:20:05,556 --> 00:20:06,933
Time out.

314
00:20:07,059 --> 00:20:08,227
I'm already late.

315
00:20:08,352 --> 00:20:10,147
I have to put more
people to sleep

316
00:20:10,272 --> 00:20:11,859
than an Academy Award telecast.

317
00:20:11,983 --> 00:20:15,197
I have children lining up the
world over for some shut eye.

318
00:20:15,323 --> 00:20:18,370
And you help
children, don't you?

319
00:20:18,495 --> 00:20:20,080
That's what I live for--

320
00:20:20,206 --> 00:20:21,459
to help children.

321
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:22,335
And, and--

322
00:20:23,462 --> 00:20:24,672
Ah.

323
00:20:24,797 --> 00:20:25,840
I see.

324
00:20:25,966 --> 00:20:28,136
I see what you're
getting at here.

325
00:20:28,262 --> 00:20:30,056
OK.

326
00:20:30,182 --> 00:20:33,604
I'm not supposed to do this,
but you need someone, right?

327
00:20:33,729 --> 00:20:35,566
You need a guide, right?

328
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:38,279
Someone who knows
the lay of the land.

329
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:41,452
Someone who is a qualified
leader to find the hidden signs

330
00:20:41,576 --> 00:20:43,288
and define their meaning.

331
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:46,293
I don't know anybody like that.

332
00:20:46,419 --> 00:20:50,800
But I happen to be a kick
butt Kung Fu fighter.

333
00:20:50,926 --> 00:20:53,180
I have taught myself online.

334
00:20:53,305 --> 00:20:54,599
Whoa!

335
00:20:54,724 --> 00:20:55,559
Whoa!

336
00:20:55,684 --> 00:20:56,519
Ow!

337
00:20:56,644 --> 00:20:58,022
Woo, woo, woo!

338
00:20:58,147 --> 00:20:59,399
Ooh wah!

339
00:20:59,524 --> 00:21:00,776
Yah!

340
00:21:00,902 --> 00:21:03,030
Ooh, ooh!

341
00:21:03,156 --> 00:21:05,743
See, what I'm doing now, is
I'm focusing more on the sounds

342
00:21:05,869 --> 00:21:06,912
than the actual movements.

343
00:21:07,037 --> 00:21:08,289
Because you take
one piece at a time.

344
00:21:08,415 --> 00:21:10,293
Woo!

345
00:21:10,419 --> 00:21:11,503
Ahh!

346
00:21:11,629 --> 00:21:12,422
Ooh.

347
00:21:12,547 --> 00:21:13,507
Oh.

348
00:21:13,632 --> 00:21:15,176
Oh.

349
00:21:15,302 --> 00:21:16,053
Ooh.

350
00:21:16,179 --> 00:21:18,099
So you'll help us?

351
00:21:18,223 --> 00:21:18,975
Yes.

352
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:21,229
Oh, thank you Sandman!

353
00:21:21,353 --> 00:21:24,526
Oh, you're welcome.

354
00:21:24,652 --> 00:21:25,695
No, it's OK.

355
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:26,529
That's OK.

356
00:21:26,655 --> 00:21:27,406
I understand.

357
00:21:27,532 --> 00:21:28,533
Cool with me.

358
00:21:28,659 --> 00:21:30,119
There you go.

359
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,707
Right back at you.

360
00:21:32,832 --> 00:21:34,877
How about those Bears, huh?

361
00:21:35,003 --> 00:21:36,129
Ooh, it's getting late.

362
00:21:36,255 --> 00:21:37,298
You know what?

363
00:21:37,423 --> 00:21:38,592
It's getting late.

364
00:21:38,717 --> 00:21:39,928
We've got to find
you a place to sleep.

365
00:21:40,053 --> 00:21:40,888
Come on, let's go.

366
00:21:54,787 --> 00:21:56,498
It was-- it was--

367
00:21:56,623 --> 00:22:00,129
it was a left at the oak and
a right at the cedar, right?

368
00:22:00,255 --> 00:22:01,632
Or was it the other way around?

369
00:22:04,345 --> 00:22:08,393
Oh, this fog is
wrecking my hair.

370
00:22:08,519 --> 00:22:09,813
Oh!

371
00:22:09,938 --> 00:22:11,190
Although the moisture
does seem to be doing

372
00:22:11,316 --> 00:22:13,277
wonders for my complexion.

373
00:22:20,164 --> 00:22:23,670
Just a lovely little
walk in the forest.

374
00:22:23,796 --> 00:22:24,589
Tra-la-la!
Oh!

375
00:22:24,713 --> 00:22:25,423
Oh!

376
00:22:25,549 --> 00:22:26,633
Oh, oh!

377
00:22:26,759 --> 00:22:28,012
Left-right,
left-right, left-right,

378
00:22:28,136 --> 00:22:30,766
left-right, left-right,
left-right, left-right.

379
00:22:30,892 --> 00:22:32,769
One.

380
00:22:32,895 --> 00:22:34,356
OK.

381
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,192
All right, this is--

382
00:22:36,317 --> 00:22:37,569
left, take a left here.

383
00:22:37,695 --> 00:22:39,907
All right, left
and now straight.

384
00:22:40,032 --> 00:22:40,992
And step--

385
00:22:41,117 --> 00:22:42,662
This is disgusting.

386
00:22:42,787 --> 00:22:43,997
Hey, Sandman.

387
00:22:44,122 --> 00:22:46,418
Anyone ever tell you
this is a stinky bog?

388
00:22:46,543 --> 00:22:48,088
Right, bog.

389
00:22:48,213 --> 00:22:49,757
Safest place there is.

390
00:22:49,882 --> 00:22:52,136
Yeah, well, I'm just gonna
take my chances somewhere else.

391
00:22:52,262 --> 00:22:55,476
Well, be my guest, but
wolves will not come into bogs.

392
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,356
Wolves do not like bogs.

393
00:23:02,572 --> 00:23:07,120
Did, did I mention what
a beautiful bog this was?

394
00:23:07,246 --> 00:23:08,373
Yes, thank you!

395
00:23:08,498 --> 00:23:09,583
I'll be here all week.

396
00:23:09,709 --> 00:23:10,460
Tip your waitress.

397
00:23:11,587 --> 00:23:14,800
All right, time for me to go.

398
00:23:14,926 --> 00:23:16,762
All right, right this way.

399
00:23:16,888 --> 00:23:17,764
Come on.

400
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:21,103
Up here.

401
00:23:21,229 --> 00:23:21,980
Perfect.

402
00:23:22,105 --> 00:23:23,232
Uh, place right here.

403
00:23:23,357 --> 00:23:25,069
All right, go to sleep.

404
00:23:25,193 --> 00:23:26,446
Okie dokie.

405
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:27,698
All right, just lie down here.

406
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:29,076
Be very comfortable.

407
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,786
Everything here is from
Bed, Bogs and Beyond.

408
00:23:30,912 --> 00:23:32,832
All right?

409
00:23:32,957 --> 00:23:33,833
Sleep tight, kids.

410
00:23:37,089 --> 00:23:38,968
Off like a light,
into the night.

411
00:23:47,065 --> 00:23:48,568
Hansel?

412
00:23:48,693 --> 00:23:49,402
Uh-huh?

413
00:23:49,528 --> 00:23:50,404
I'm hungry.

414
00:23:52,783 --> 00:23:56,665
Me too, but we'll find
something to eat tomorrow, OK?

415
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:57,625
I promise.

416
00:24:06,557 --> 00:24:08,728
Goodnight, Hansel.

417
00:24:08,853 --> 00:24:10,356
Goodnight, Gretel.

418
00:24:26,592 --> 00:24:28,262
Do you think he's coming back?

419
00:24:28,386 --> 00:24:29,513
I don't know.

420
00:24:29,639 --> 00:24:30,599
Come on, let's find
something to eat.

421
00:24:36,192 --> 00:24:38,029
Once I get out of
here, I am never going

422
00:24:38,153 --> 00:24:39,949
to live anywhere near a forest!

423
00:24:40,073 --> 00:24:41,451
Trees, trees, trees.

424
00:24:41,576 --> 00:24:42,453
Hate them.

425
00:24:42,578 --> 00:24:43,288
Oh!

426
00:24:59,065 --> 00:24:59,858
Look, Gretel!

427
00:25:08,623 --> 00:25:09,917
Mm.

428
00:25:10,042 --> 00:25:12,296
Smells good.

429
00:25:12,422 --> 00:25:14,133
No!

430
00:25:14,258 --> 00:25:16,595
Are you nuts?

431
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,015
Fire berries.

432
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:21,103
Wow, that was close, Hansel.

433
00:25:21,229 --> 00:25:22,606
I admit it, I'm impressed.

434
00:25:22,731 --> 00:25:24,693
OK, here's what
I'm going to do now.

435
00:25:24,818 --> 00:25:26,404
I gotta get you two some
food and out of here.

436
00:25:26,529 --> 00:25:27,823
Everyone fall in.

437
00:25:27,949 --> 00:25:28,783
Let's go.

438
00:25:34,251 --> 00:25:35,419
This way.

439
00:25:35,545 --> 00:25:38,759
I, uh, don't want to
go direct, because--

440
00:26:19,579 --> 00:26:21,542
Look!

441
00:26:21,666 --> 00:26:23,336
That's a sign.

442
00:26:23,462 --> 00:26:27,928
Did I put the man
in Sandman, or what?

443
00:26:28,053 --> 00:26:30,682
I'm having a huge
pan-fried river

444
00:26:30,808 --> 00:26:33,186
trout with pumpernickel bread.

445
00:26:33,312 --> 00:26:34,982
Mm!

446
00:26:35,106 --> 00:26:40,658
Wild boar with spiced
apple and Black Forest cake.

447
00:26:40,783 --> 00:26:41,952
Let's go!

448
00:26:42,077 --> 00:26:42,953
Uh-oh.

449
00:26:43,079 --> 00:26:45,708
What do you mean, uh oh?

450
00:26:45,833 --> 00:26:46,585
I'm on.

451
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:47,586
No way!

452
00:26:47,712 --> 00:26:49,298
There's food waiting for us.

453
00:26:49,423 --> 00:26:52,762
Yeah, well, there are millions
of boys and girls expecting me.

454
00:26:52,888 --> 00:26:53,763
What am I supposed to do?

455
00:26:56,393 --> 00:26:58,731
Can't you just delegate?

456
00:26:58,856 --> 00:27:03,531
I-- uh, uh, look!

457
00:27:03,656 --> 00:27:05,910
Delegate, delegate,
delegate, delegate.

458
00:27:10,083 --> 00:27:12,630
Oh, you mean more of a
supervisory position.

459
00:27:12,755 --> 00:27:14,883
Well, you know, it's worth
a thought, I suppose.

460
00:27:15,009 --> 00:27:17,472
But it's a-- that's, um--
it-- there's a system.

461
00:27:17,597 --> 00:27:19,809
And I'm a company man,
don't want to put a crimp

462
00:27:19,935 --> 00:27:21,228
in the system, and union--

463
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:22,982
OK!

464
00:27:23,106 --> 00:27:24,526
I am coming already.

465
00:27:24,651 --> 00:27:26,070
I-- I, uh-- I--

466
00:27:26,195 --> 00:27:28,491
kids, I'll be back
as fast as I can.

467
00:27:28,616 --> 00:27:30,995
Get me some food to go, OK?

468
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:35,545
Off like a light,
into the night!

469
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:38,383
You know what?

470
00:27:38,508 --> 00:27:39,552
I need the cardio.

471
00:27:39,677 --> 00:27:41,388
I'm just going to
stroll, because--

472
00:27:41,513 --> 00:27:44,602
I'm just gonna-- you know what--

473
00:27:44,728 --> 00:27:45,979
Wait, Sandman!

474
00:27:46,105 --> 00:27:47,023
Come back!

475
00:27:47,148 --> 00:27:48,609
I'm eating.

476
00:27:48,735 --> 00:27:49,819
I don't believe this.

477
00:27:53,492 --> 00:27:54,328
Food.

The sign said diner.

531

Yeah, I'm the diner.

532
00:30:20,706 --> 00:30:23,128
You didn't really fall
for the sign, did you?

533
00:30:23,252 --> 00:30:26,675
I mean, that's the
oldest trick in the book.

534
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,178
We're hungry.

535
00:30:28,303 --> 00:30:29,430
HANSEL: Try starving!

536
00:30:29,555 --> 00:30:31,308
I love this job!

537

Oh!

538
00:30:34,439 --> 00:30:37,485
You should have followed the
skull and crossbones, kid.

539
00:30:37,611 --> 00:30:39,405
Hey, wood sprite.

540
00:30:39,531 --> 00:30:40,491
Get away from them.

541
00:30:40,616 --> 00:30:41,826
You trying to ruin my fun again?

542
00:30:41,952 --> 00:30:44,665
Just making nice with
our guests, genius.

543
00:30:44,789 --> 00:30:47,295
Why don't you go outside and
wait for your Ab-buster 3,000

544
00:30:47,419 --> 00:30:48,212
to arrive?

545
00:30:48,338 --> 00:30:50,716
Heaven knows you need it.

546
00:30:50,842 --> 00:30:51,676
And I'm not a wood sprite.

547
00:30:51,802 --> 00:30:53,263
I'm a wood faerie.

548
00:30:53,388 --> 00:30:56,560
And you would know that if
you weren't such a drop out.

549
00:30:56,685 --> 00:30:58,648
I'm much more beautiful
than wood sprite.

550
00:30:58,772 --> 00:31:00,901
Ugh.

551
00:31:01,026 --> 00:31:02,362
Much more of a pain.

552
00:31:02,488 --> 00:31:04,073
Wish I never captured you.

553
00:31:04,199 --> 00:31:05,826
Ugh, dames.

554
00:31:05,952 --> 00:31:08,372
Bah.

555
00:31:08,498 --> 00:31:09,708
So?

556
00:31:10,752 --> 00:31:11,795
Zap me, fat boy!

557
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,715
Take me out of my misery!

558
00:31:18,599 --> 00:31:22,105
Stop moving, you dumb pixie!

559
00:31:24,483 --> 00:31:25,861
The thing that
twists his noodle

560
00:31:25,986 --> 00:31:27,405
is he can't figure out
whether he's just a bad shot,

561
00:31:27,531 --> 00:31:29,368
or I'm really that quick.

562
00:31:29,492 --> 00:31:30,536
Watch it, tubs.

563
00:31:30,661 --> 00:31:31,746
You're going to
blow a blood vessel.

564
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:36,463
Leave my blood
vessels out of it!

565
00:31:41,722 --> 00:31:42,849
Hansel?

566
00:31:42,974 --> 00:31:43,851
Gretel?

567
00:31:43,976 --> 00:31:44,936
Hansel?

568
00:31:45,061 --> 00:31:46,063
This is troll country.

569
00:31:46,188 --> 00:31:47,691
I wouldn't want you
to run into one.

570
00:31:47,816 --> 00:31:48,651
Gretel?

571
00:31:48,776 --> 00:31:49,986
Hansel?

572
00:31:50,112 --> 00:31:50,821
Hansel?

573
00:31:50,946 --> 00:31:52,408
Gretel?

574
00:31:52,532 --> 00:31:54,703
Just when I thought I actually
made some real friends.

575
00:32:01,673 --> 00:32:02,633
Fine.

576
00:32:02,758 --> 00:32:04,052
Fine.

577
00:32:04,178 --> 00:32:05,596
Maybe I'll find another
couple of lost children

578
00:32:05,722 --> 00:32:07,058
who will appreciate my help.

579
00:32:14,195 --> 00:32:15,238
Hansel?

580
00:32:28,512 --> 00:32:30,473
You are the weakest link!

581
00:32:32,518 --> 00:32:33,478
Goodbye!

582
00:32:39,823 --> 00:32:40,866
Sandman!

583
00:32:40,992 --> 00:32:43,036
I thought we'd
never see you again!

584
00:32:43,162 --> 00:32:45,416
Oh, oh, ye have little faith.

585
00:32:45,541 --> 00:32:47,628
Just ah-- Let me just ah--

586
00:32:47,753 --> 00:32:48,838
let me get the lock.
OK.

587
00:32:50,174 --> 00:32:51,593
Thank you, Sandman.

588
00:32:51,718 --> 00:32:55,016
And, uh-huh.

589
00:32:55,141 --> 00:32:55,851
Let's vamoose.

590
00:32:55,976 --> 00:32:56,811
Come on.

591
00:32:56,936 --> 00:32:57,688
All right.

592
00:32:57,812 --> 00:32:59,899
This way, follow me.

593
00:33:00,025 --> 00:33:00,818
Hold on.

594
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:05,116
Be a darling, would you?

595
00:33:05,242 --> 00:33:06,118
Back off!

596
00:33:06,243 --> 00:33:08,163
I know who you are, faerie girl.

597
00:33:08,289 --> 00:33:09,082
Just--

598
00:33:09,207 --> 00:33:10,125
What's wrong, Sandman?

599
00:33:10,251 --> 00:33:12,421
Sandman?

600
00:33:12,546 --> 00:33:14,967
As in sprinkle,
sprinkle, sleepy sleep?

601
00:33:15,092 --> 00:33:17,138
I do kids, all right?

602
00:33:17,262 --> 00:33:19,516
And the occasional troll.

603
00:33:19,642 --> 00:33:20,393
Yeah, yeah, good job.

604
00:33:20,518 --> 00:33:21,938
Could you possibly--

605
00:33:22,062 --> 00:33:25,652
I don't trust anybody who,
uh, dates the Boogeyman.

606
00:33:25,778 --> 00:33:26,738
What?

607
00:33:26,862 --> 00:33:28,282
Who told you that?

608
00:33:28,407 --> 00:33:30,828
We haven't been going
out for, like, hours.

609
00:33:30,953 --> 00:33:33,291
I guess you boogie
oogie oogied till you

610
00:33:33,416 --> 00:33:35,336
just couldn't boogie no more.

611
00:33:35,461 --> 00:33:37,172
I am not that kind of faerie!

612
00:33:37,298 --> 00:33:39,676
We just happened
not to get along.

613
00:33:39,802 --> 00:33:42,222
Besides, he doesn't
use a handkerchief.

614
00:33:42,348 --> 00:33:43,892
OK, good luck.

615
00:33:44,018 --> 00:33:46,438
And I'm sure, once you get free,
you will find Mister Right.

616
00:33:46,563 --> 00:33:48,149
Let's go, let's go.

617
00:33:48,275 --> 00:33:49,569
We can't just leave her here.

618
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:50,988
HANSEL: Yeah, maybe
she can help us.

619
00:33:51,113 --> 00:33:52,992
You know, two heads
are better than one.

620
00:33:55,913 --> 00:33:59,419
So, uh, so somebody doesn't
like the job I'm doing?

621
00:33:59,545 --> 00:34:00,713
No, no.

622
00:34:00,838 --> 00:34:02,675
What he means is she
has faerie powers.

623
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:03,802
Maybe she can help us.

624
00:34:03,927 --> 00:34:05,179
I'm pretty mean with the wand.

625
00:34:10,062 --> 00:34:11,899
Maybe, um, maybe,
you have a point.

626
00:34:12,025 --> 00:34:12,985
I just, uh--

627
00:34:13,109 --> 00:34:13,945
OK.

628
00:34:14,069 --> 00:34:15,822
Uh, you two wait outside.

629
00:34:15,948 --> 00:34:16,699
We should speak.

630
00:34:16,825 --> 00:34:17,618
We can wait.

631
00:34:20,038 --> 00:34:25,089
This is strictly one
magical character to another,

632
00:34:25,214 --> 00:34:26,425
you understand?

633
00:34:26,549 --> 00:34:28,678
So, uh, OK?

634
00:34:28,803 --> 00:34:29,680
Great.

635
00:34:33,854 --> 00:34:35,858
OK.

636
00:34:35,982 --> 00:34:37,694
First things first--
you can only use

637
00:34:37,819 --> 00:34:39,196
your magic against the enemy.

638
00:34:39,322 --> 00:34:41,033
On my honor as a member
of the Faerie Clan.

639
00:34:41,158 --> 00:34:42,243
I am in charge here.

640
00:34:42,369 --> 00:34:43,621
Aye, aye, captain.

641
00:34:43,746 --> 00:34:46,835
And remember-- you are
bound by faerie code.

642
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:47,920
Right.

643
00:34:48,045 --> 00:34:49,631
Faerie code.

644
00:34:49,756 --> 00:34:51,051
Absolutely.

645
00:34:51,176 --> 00:34:52,678
Whatever.

646
00:34:52,803 --> 00:34:56,309
Can you please help me get
out of these bracelets?

647
00:34:56,435 --> 00:34:58,480
OK.

648
00:34:58,605 --> 00:35:00,609
There's that.

649
00:35:00,734 --> 00:35:02,320
And--

650
00:35:02,445 --> 00:35:03,322
Thank you.

651
00:35:06,369 --> 00:35:08,748
Oh, you got, uh, that's, uh--

652
00:35:08,873 --> 00:35:11,920
guess it's important
to accessorize.

653
00:35:12,045 --> 00:35:12,838
Ooh.

654
00:35:12,963 --> 00:35:14,716
That's nice.

655
00:35:14,842 --> 00:35:16,595
Are you trying to seduce me?

656
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:17,722
Because-- whew!

657
00:35:35,795 --> 00:35:38,508
You don't have
a clue where you are, do you?

658
00:35:38,633 --> 00:35:40,135
What is with
all the questions?

659
00:35:40,261 --> 00:35:41,388
I haven't had sleep in two days.

660
00:35:41,513 --> 00:35:43,099
Do you mind?

661
00:35:43,225 --> 00:35:45,979
And I happen to know
exactly where we are.

662
00:35:46,105 --> 00:35:48,025
Well?

663
00:35:48,149 --> 00:35:50,445
The magic forest.

664
00:35:50,571 --> 00:35:52,741
On our way out, if you
want to get technical.

665
00:35:52,866 --> 00:35:54,578
OK, Sandy, since you know
so much about the forest--

666
00:35:54,702 --> 00:35:58,418
where's the thousand-year-old
twisting birch?

667
00:35:58,542 --> 00:36:00,295
Easy.

668
00:36:00,421 --> 00:36:01,255
Eh.

669
00:36:11,815 --> 00:36:14,612
That way.

670
00:36:14,738 --> 00:36:17,158
There is no thousand-year-old
twisting birch.

671
00:36:20,247 --> 00:36:23,586
Are you purposely trying
to undermine my authority?

672
00:36:23,711 --> 00:36:25,756
Listen, if we don't get these
kids something to eat soon,

673
00:36:25,882 --> 00:36:27,092
they're going to
waste away to nothing.

674
00:36:27,218 --> 00:36:28,678
So the sooner we get
them home, the sooner

675
00:36:28,803 --> 00:36:30,139
they can get something to eat.

676
00:36:30,264 --> 00:36:36,609
And I think it's about
time you were voted off.

677
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:41,075
Food!

678
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:42,035
Oh!

679
00:37:08,539 --> 00:37:10,375
I can't walk another step.

680
00:37:10,501 --> 00:37:12,838
I'm too hungry.

681
00:37:12,963 --> 00:37:13,798
Come on, Gretel.

682
00:37:13,923 --> 00:37:14,925
It won't be long now.

683
00:37:15,051 --> 00:37:16,135
We'll be out of here soon.

684
00:37:16,261 --> 00:37:17,638
You'll see.

685
00:37:17,763 --> 00:37:20,643
Carry me, Sandman?

686
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:21,895
Me too.

687
00:37:22,021 --> 00:37:24,525
No, it's, uh, this way.

688
00:37:24,651 --> 00:37:25,819
Not too far now.

689
00:37:25,944 --> 00:37:26,862
Come on.

690
00:37:29,742 --> 00:37:31,078
I wouldn't go that
way, if I were you.

691
00:37:33,916 --> 00:37:35,502
Excuse me?

692
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:36,671
Well, that way will just carry
you deeper into the forest.

693
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:38,382
I don't think so.

694
00:37:38,508 --> 00:37:41,429
You are so in denial.

695
00:37:41,555 --> 00:37:42,515
Psst.

696
00:37:47,439 --> 00:37:49,026
Am not!

697
00:37:49,151 --> 00:37:50,319
You so are!

698
00:37:50,445 --> 00:37:51,196
Am not!

699
00:37:51,322 --> 00:37:52,365
Yes, you are!

700
00:37:52,491 --> 00:37:53,242
Am not!

701
00:37:53,367 --> 00:37:54,159
Yes, you are.

702
00:37:54,285 --> 00:37:55,203
Am not.

703
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:56,831
Am not, not, not--

704
00:37:56,956 --> 00:37:59,294
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

705
00:37:59,419 --> 00:38:00,128
Yes!

706
00:38:00,254 --> 00:38:01,088
Not, not, not!

707
00:38:04,386 --> 00:38:06,556
Oh, nice.

708
00:38:06,682 --> 00:38:07,808
Dinner and a movie?

709
00:38:07,934 --> 00:38:09,645
I like it.

710
00:38:09,771 --> 00:38:10,981
Uh, hello?

711
00:38:11,106 --> 00:38:12,859
Yoo-hoo!

712
00:38:12,984 --> 00:38:14,695
Table for one!

713
00:38:14,821 --> 00:38:16,072
I'm ready to place my order.

714
00:38:16,198 --> 00:38:17,451
Yoo-hoo!

715
00:38:17,575 --> 00:38:18,869
Hello?

716
00:38:18,995 --> 00:38:20,122
I'll call back later.

717
00:38:20,247 --> 00:38:21,499
Can I get a little service?

718
00:38:21,624 --> 00:38:22,417
Waiter?

719
00:38:23,419 --> 00:38:24,671
Waiter?

720
00:38:24,796 --> 00:38:28,678
Not, not, not,
not, not, not, not--

721
00:38:28,803 --> 00:38:29,722
Yes, you are.

722
00:38:29,847 --> 00:38:30,682
Yes, you are.

723
00:38:30,807 --> 00:38:31,767
Yes, you are!

724
00:38:35,189 --> 00:38:36,942
That does it!

725
00:38:38,988 --> 00:38:39,781
Ooh!

726
00:38:39,906 --> 00:38:41,742
Ahh!

727
00:38:41,868 --> 00:38:44,079
Let's go, light bulb.

728
00:38:44,205 --> 00:38:47,419
You're joking, right?

729
00:38:47,544 --> 00:38:48,546
Putting up your dukes!

730
00:38:48,671 --> 00:38:49,506
You're frightened, huh?

731
00:38:49,631 --> 00:38:50,508
Ha!

732
00:38:52,386 --> 00:38:53,388
I'm a wood faerie.

733
00:38:53,512 --> 00:38:54,431
And?

734
00:38:54,556 --> 00:38:57,311
I'm a girl wood faerie.

735
00:38:57,436 --> 00:38:59,315
You brought down
the thunder, baby.

736
00:38:59,439 --> 00:39:03,322
I believe in equal rights for
men, women, and wood fairies.

737
00:39:03,447 --> 00:39:04,323
Why I outta!

738
00:39:14,841 --> 00:39:17,137
Can you smell what
the Sandman's cooking?

739
00:39:21,311 --> 00:39:22,605
BOTH: Go faerie!

740
00:39:22,731 --> 00:39:23,523
Go faerie!

741
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:24,901
Go faerie!
Go faerie!

742
00:39:25,026 --> 00:39:25,861
Go faerie!

743
00:39:25,986 --> 00:39:26,779
Go fairy!

744
00:39:26,904 --> 00:39:27,655
Go faerie!

745
00:39:27,781 --> 00:39:29,116
Oh, you're pinching.

746
00:39:34,251 --> 00:39:35,586
You're kidding, right?

747
00:39:35,711 --> 00:39:37,422
It doesn't say that.

748
00:39:37,548 --> 00:39:40,011
Well, it might.

749
00:39:40,135 --> 00:39:41,805
Come on, I'm just trying to
spice it up a little bit.

750
00:39:41,931 --> 00:39:42,723
It's OK, daddy.

751
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:44,184
You were doing just fine.

752
00:39:44,309 --> 00:39:45,019
Are you sure?

753
00:39:45,144 --> 00:39:47,064
Not too scary?

754
00:39:47,189 --> 00:39:50,445
It's actually pretty good.

755
00:39:50,571 --> 00:39:51,447
OK.

756
00:39:53,909 --> 00:39:54,744
OK.

757
00:39:54,869 --> 00:39:56,205
Hm.

758
00:40:00,963 --> 00:40:01,923
I'm fine.

759
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:02,758
That was nice.

760
00:40:02,883 --> 00:40:03,635
I like that, the--

761
00:40:03,759 --> 00:40:04,636
Thank you.

762
00:40:04,761 --> 00:40:06,681
--the whole flip and the--

763
00:40:06,807 --> 00:40:07,683
OK.

764
00:40:07,808 --> 00:40:08,811
All right.

765
00:40:08,935 --> 00:40:09,812
OK.

766
00:40:09,937 --> 00:40:10,897
Oh, oh.

767
00:40:11,022 --> 00:40:13,276
Maybe, uh, maybe L5, L6.

768
00:40:13,401 --> 00:40:15,029
I don't-- a compressed disc.

769
00:40:15,155 --> 00:40:16,865
But I'm-- I'm OK.

770
00:40:16,991 --> 00:40:18,118
Oh, oh!

771
00:40:19,704 --> 00:40:20,539
Not already.

772
00:40:20,664 --> 00:40:21,415
What's up?

773
00:40:21,541 --> 00:40:22,417
I have to go.

774
00:40:22,542 --> 00:40:23,419
WOOD FAIRY: What about the kids?

775
00:40:23,544 --> 00:40:24,629
I, I know--

776
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:26,465
I'll, I'll be back
as fast as I can,

777
00:40:26,591 --> 00:40:27,968
and I will get you
out of this forest.

778
00:40:28,094 --> 00:40:29,512
And I will get you breakfast.

779
00:40:29,638 --> 00:40:30,765
I mean it!

780
00:40:30,890 --> 00:40:33,603
Eggs, toast, waffles, bacon--

781
00:40:33,728 --> 00:40:35,857
you name it.

782
00:40:35,982 --> 00:40:40,991
Wild boar, pumpernickel bread,
Black Forest gateau with fries.

783
00:40:45,791 --> 00:40:48,504
That's going to be a little
tough at the drive-thru.

784
00:40:49,756 --> 00:40:50,632
Just gonna, uh--

785
00:40:54,807 --> 00:40:57,645
off like-- ooh, it hurts--

786
00:40:57,770 --> 00:41:01,777
off like a light,
into the night!

787
00:41:13,005 --> 00:41:14,632
What now?

788
00:41:14,758 --> 00:41:17,054
You two look exhausted.

789
00:41:17,179 --> 00:41:18,556
I'll tell you what.

790
00:41:18,681 --> 00:41:20,643
You two settle in
here for a little bit.

791
00:41:20,768 --> 00:41:23,189
I'll buzz around and
see what I can find, OK?

792
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:24,734
I'll be back in a flash.

793
00:41:26,654 --> 00:41:28,574
No pun intended.

794
00:41:28,699 --> 00:41:29,534
Hurry back.

795
00:41:34,834 --> 00:41:38,174
Closer, closer, closer now!

796
00:41:38,299 --> 00:41:40,845
Maybe a little
breeze in the night

797
00:41:40,970 --> 00:41:44,685
will help this tasty
meal on its way.

798
00:42:02,967 --> 00:42:04,511
WOOD FAERIE: Hansel?

799
00:42:04,636 --> 00:42:05,471
Gretel!

800
00:42:05,596 --> 00:42:08,601
Help me!

801
00:42:08,727 --> 00:42:09,561
The wood faerie!

802
00:42:09,687 --> 00:42:11,022
She's in trouble!

803
00:42:11,148 --> 00:42:12,608
She told us to wait here.

804
00:42:12,734 --> 00:42:13,944
But she's in trouble!

805
00:42:14,069 --> 00:42:14,821
Hansel!

806
00:42:14,945 --> 00:42:16,615
Gretel!

807
00:42:16,741 --> 00:42:20,121
We have to help her!

808
00:42:53,596 --> 00:42:54,305
Gretel!

809
00:42:54,431 --> 00:42:55,599
Gretel, wake up!

810
00:42:59,439 --> 00:43:01,401
Where's the wood faerie?

811
00:43:01,527 --> 00:43:02,403
I don't know.

812
00:43:07,328 --> 00:43:08,872
Hey, Gretel.

813
00:43:08,998 --> 00:43:09,832
Do you smell that?

814
00:43:13,548 --> 00:43:14,424
Yes!

815
00:44:12,149 --> 00:44:17,450
Two very hungry children
are feasting on my house.

816
00:44:17,575 --> 00:44:19,495
Can you see us?

817
00:44:19,621 --> 00:44:21,498
I am a little short-sighted.

818
00:44:21,624 --> 00:44:28,719
But I can hear you and, more
importantly, I can smell you.

819
00:44:28,845 --> 00:44:32,977
A boy and a girl.

820
00:44:33,102 --> 00:44:34,271
What are your names?

821
00:44:34,396 --> 00:44:35,481
I'm Gretel.

822
00:44:35,607 --> 00:44:37,025
This is my brother, Hansel.

823
00:44:37,151 --> 00:44:37,944
Hello.

824
00:44:38,069 --> 00:44:39,279
Oh!

825
00:44:39,405 --> 00:44:40,281
Oh.

826
00:44:42,285 --> 00:44:44,079
There's lots more
where this comes from.

827
00:44:44,205 --> 00:44:44,956
Wow!

828
00:44:45,081 --> 00:44:46,501
Real food!

829
00:44:46,625 --> 00:44:48,087
Please, help yourselves.

830
00:44:48,211 --> 00:44:50,048
Thank you!

831
00:44:50,174 --> 00:44:52,719
Oh, you're all skin and bone.

832
00:44:56,977 --> 00:44:58,479
Here, come inside.

833
00:44:58,605 --> 00:45:01,902
There's lots more to eat.

834
00:45:02,027 --> 00:45:03,238
What are you thinking?

835
00:45:03,362 --> 00:45:06,785
I'm not, my stomach is.

836
00:45:06,911 --> 00:45:08,455
Something isn't right.

837
00:45:08,581 --> 00:45:09,290
Oh, Gretel.

838
00:45:09,415 --> 00:45:11,001
You're way too cautious.

839
00:45:11,127 --> 00:45:15,091
She's just a sweet old lady with
a ton of food she needs eating.

840
00:45:15,217 --> 00:45:17,679
Well, I guess you're right.

841
00:45:17,805 --> 00:45:20,559
I mean, she can barely see us.

842
00:45:20,685 --> 00:45:22,021
Exactly.

843
00:45:22,145 --> 00:45:24,191
And when was the last time
we had this much to eat?

844
00:45:24,315 --> 00:45:25,694
Try never.

845
00:45:25,818 --> 00:45:27,195
Right.

846
00:45:27,321 --> 00:45:31,161
So I say, we eat like
pigs, smile, eat some more.

847
00:45:31,287 --> 00:45:32,872
Pack as much food
as we can carry,

848
00:45:32,998 --> 00:45:36,254
say our thank you's, and
get out of this forest.

849
00:45:36,378 --> 00:45:38,674
You with me?

850
00:45:38,799 --> 00:45:40,552
WOMAN: Oh, look
what I just found!

851
00:45:40,678 --> 00:45:44,977
A big pan-fried river trout,
wild boar, pumpernickel bread,

852
00:45:45,102 --> 00:45:47,355
some Black Forest gateau.

853
00:45:47,481 --> 00:45:49,860
Oh, and a side of fries!

854
00:45:49,985 --> 00:45:50,820
Got any ketchup?

855
00:46:39,697 --> 00:46:40,949
WOMAN: Come, hurry!

856
00:46:41,074 --> 00:46:41,951
Gorge yourselves!

857
00:46:42,075 --> 00:46:42,869
Feast!

858
00:46:42,994 --> 00:46:44,664
Pig out until you oink!

859
00:46:44,789 --> 00:46:46,082
Eat, feed, devour!

860
00:46:46,208 --> 00:46:48,838
I love to hear little
children eating.

861
00:46:48,962 --> 00:46:51,008
It makes me so, so--

862
00:46:51,134 --> 00:46:53,054
oh!

863
00:46:53,178 --> 00:46:55,891
Is it getting hot in here?

864
00:46:56,017 --> 00:46:56,894
You just go ahead.

865
00:46:57,018 --> 00:46:58,647
You eat as much as you like.

866
00:47:07,202 --> 00:47:08,955
HANSEL: So good.

867
00:47:09,081 --> 00:47:10,458
Here, have some.

868
00:47:17,638 --> 00:47:19,224
Let's get the
show on the road.

869
00:47:19,349 --> 00:47:21,478
Somewhere, someone has
an egg and a muffin

870
00:47:21,602 --> 00:47:22,647
and a sausage on
the grill, and I'm

871
00:47:22,771 --> 00:47:24,482
ready to place an order, kids!

872
00:47:24,608 --> 00:47:25,818
Kids?

873
00:47:25,944 --> 00:47:26,862
Hansel?

874
00:47:26,987 --> 00:47:27,738
Gretel!

875
00:47:27,864 --> 00:47:28,740
Hansel?

876
00:47:28,865 --> 00:47:29,784
Gretel?

877
00:47:29,908 --> 00:47:30,702
Daglo?

878
00:47:30,827 --> 00:47:32,371
Hansel?

879
00:47:32,497 --> 00:47:33,707
Great.

880
00:47:33,832 --> 00:47:35,585
I spend a whole night
at work just to come

881
00:47:35,711 --> 00:47:37,380
home to an empty forest.

882
00:47:37,505 --> 00:47:38,465
OK.

883
00:47:38,591 --> 00:47:39,551
Hansel?

884
00:47:39,675 --> 00:47:40,427
Gretel?

885
00:47:40,552 --> 00:47:41,345
Hansel?

886
00:47:42,264 --> 00:47:44,768
Hello?

887
00:48:13,401 --> 00:48:14,278
Well.

888
00:48:18,493 --> 00:48:23,418
I thought I'd never say
this, but thank you.

889
00:48:23,544 --> 00:48:25,922
What are you doing here,
and where are the kids?

890
00:48:26,048 --> 00:48:28,719
Well, as soon as you checked
out for the night shift,

891
00:48:28,844 --> 00:48:30,764
it turned into a
twister around here.

892
00:48:30,890 --> 00:48:32,351
And I got separated
from the kids,

893
00:48:32,475 --> 00:48:35,105
and then I got trapped
under this branch.

894
00:48:35,231 --> 00:48:37,151
They still should be
where I left them.

895
00:48:37,275 --> 00:48:39,488
Well, well, they're not.

896
00:48:39,613 --> 00:48:40,865
Let's get looking.

897
00:48:40,991 --> 00:48:44,288
If anything happened to
those children, I will--

898
00:48:44,413 --> 00:48:45,164
Gretel?

899
00:48:45,290 --> 00:48:46,041
Hansel?

900
00:48:46,167 --> 00:48:46,917
Gretel?

901
00:48:47,042 --> 00:48:47,919
Hansel?

902
00:48:48,044 --> 00:48:48,921
Gretel!

903
00:49:03,362 --> 00:49:04,615
SPEAKER : The
benefits of laughter.

904
00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:07,287
It's no secret that
laughter makes you smile.

905
00:49:07,411 --> 00:49:08,538
Well, guess what?

906
00:49:08,664 --> 00:49:10,124
It also raises the
levels of chemicals

907
00:49:10,250 --> 00:49:12,462
that have a positive effect
on your immune system.

908
00:49:12,587 --> 00:49:14,048
So go ahead--

909
00:49:14,173 --> 00:49:17,595
I asked for a lemon drop
martini, shaken not stirred,

910
00:49:17,721 --> 00:49:21,477
and with sugar all the
way around the rim.

911
00:49:21,602 --> 00:49:25,442
I finished the kitchen,
the bedroom, and bathroom.

912
00:49:25,568 --> 00:49:27,154
Upstairs and down?

913
00:49:27,279 --> 00:49:28,114
TROLL: Yes.

914
00:49:28,239 --> 00:49:28,991
Yes, what?

915
00:49:29,115 --> 00:49:32,997
Yes, darling dearest.

916
00:49:33,122 --> 00:49:34,625
And the wire hangers?

917
00:49:34,751 --> 00:49:35,919
TROLL: All gone.

918
00:49:36,044 --> 00:49:37,130
Good.

919
00:49:37,255 --> 00:49:40,928
Now, fix me something to eat.

920
00:49:44,768 --> 00:49:46,437
It's not fair.

921
00:49:46,562 --> 00:49:47,773
I'm a ferocious troll.

922
00:49:47,898 --> 00:49:49,693
This is my house.

923
00:49:49,818 --> 00:49:51,195
What was that, my sweet?

924
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:54,535
No, nothing, darling dearest!

925
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:59,126
By the way, your card
is way over the limit.

926
00:49:59,251 --> 00:50:00,378
I think you'd better
start thinking

927
00:50:00,504 --> 00:50:02,632
about getting a real job.

928
00:50:02,757 --> 00:50:06,764
We can't live on credit
forever, now, can we?

929
00:50:17,908 --> 00:50:19,453
My stomach's gonna explode.

930
00:50:22,082 --> 00:50:23,418
Wafer thin mints?

931
00:50:23,544 --> 00:50:24,587
No.

932
00:50:24,712 --> 00:50:26,465
Full up.

933
00:50:26,591 --> 00:50:27,467
We should be going.

934
00:50:27,592 --> 00:50:29,220
Huh?

935
00:50:29,345 --> 00:50:33,101
I just don't think I can move.

936
00:50:33,227 --> 00:50:35,064
It's getting dark out.

937
00:50:35,188 --> 00:50:38,987
Well, of course you must go.

938
00:50:39,112 --> 00:50:42,785
But the forest is no place at
night for two small children,

939
00:50:42,910 --> 00:50:48,337
what with trolls and wolves, all
manner of creatures out there,

940
00:50:48,461 --> 00:50:52,552
roaming the cold, dark unknown.

941
00:50:52,677 --> 00:50:56,893
But, you know best.

942
00:50:57,018 --> 00:50:58,938
I could pack you a doggy bag.

943
00:50:59,064 --> 00:51:02,695
Or what if you stayed here
tonight, and in the morning

944
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:04,531
we'll have a big breakfast!

945
00:51:04,657 --> 00:51:07,495
And then I'll take you to
the edge of the forest.

946
00:51:07,620 --> 00:51:12,337
We can have eggs and
bacon, sausage, mushrooms,

947
00:51:12,461 --> 00:51:13,714
French toast, the works.

948
00:51:16,970 --> 00:51:19,181
But there's nowhere
for us to sleep.

949
00:51:19,307 --> 00:51:20,851
Nonsense, child.

950
00:51:20,977 --> 00:51:22,061
Look.

951
00:51:30,242 --> 00:51:31,620
OK.

952
00:51:31,745 --> 00:51:33,540
But right after
breakfast, we go.

953
00:51:33,665 --> 00:51:34,541
Of course.

954
00:51:44,851 --> 00:51:49,108
Goodnight, you
delicious young things.

955
00:51:49,234 --> 00:51:50,361
HANSEL: Goodnight.

956
00:51:50,486 --> 00:51:53,741
Sleep well, with full tummies.

957
00:51:56,705 --> 00:51:57,540
GRETEL: Goodnight.

958
00:52:02,090 --> 00:52:06,931
And dream of a
grand slam breakfast.

959
00:52:07,057 --> 00:52:10,437
HANSEL: Remember, we eat,
then we bust a move, OK?

960
00:52:10,562 --> 00:52:11,314
GRETEL: OK.

961
00:52:13,192 --> 00:52:15,530
Hansel!

962
00:52:23,001 --> 00:52:23,794
Gretel?

963
00:52:23,919 --> 00:52:25,088
Ha- Hansel?

964
00:52:25,213 --> 00:52:26,090
Gretel?

965
00:52:26,214 --> 00:52:27,842
Hansel?

966
00:52:27,968 --> 00:52:30,347
Gretel?

967
00:52:30,472 --> 00:52:31,432
They're gone.

968
00:52:31,557 --> 00:52:33,561
Those poor kids,
I let them down.

969
00:52:33,686 --> 00:52:34,646
What if the witch has them?

970
00:52:34,771 --> 00:52:36,148
Don't be silly.

971
00:52:36,274 --> 00:52:37,526
They're probably at home
right now, tucked up in bed.

972
00:52:37,651 --> 00:52:39,154
No, they're not!

973
00:52:39,278 --> 00:52:40,990
They're hopelessly lost and
starving, and, and wondering

974
00:52:41,115 --> 00:52:43,244
why I abandoned them.

975
00:52:43,370 --> 00:52:45,122
I was supposed to
help them, but I just

976
00:52:45,248 --> 00:52:46,291
ended up making things worse.

977
00:52:46,417 --> 00:52:49,380
Don't say that.

978
00:52:49,505 --> 00:52:50,882

I'm not a mythic--

981
00:53:00,858 --> 00:53:02,068
mythical archetype.

982
00:53:02,194 --> 00:53:04,823
I'm just a-- just a
fairy tale character.

983
00:53:04,948 --> 00:53:08,872
And not very good one.

984
00:53:08,997 --> 00:53:11,001
Kids don't like me.

985
00:53:11,126 --> 00:53:12,337
I mean, have you
ever met a kid that

986
00:53:12,461 --> 00:53:14,548
actually wants to go to sleep?

987
00:53:14,674 --> 00:53:15,508
Course not.

988
00:53:19,265 --> 00:53:20,100
I hate myself.

989
00:53:20,225 --> 00:53:22,395
I hate my job.

990
00:53:22,521 --> 00:53:23,940
Sandman, it's nobody's fault.

991
00:53:24,065 --> 00:53:26,361
Leave, leave me alone.

992
00:53:26,486 --> 00:53:27,905
Don't.

993
00:53:28,030 --> 00:53:31,202
Just go away into the forest,
so I can be by myself.

994
00:53:36,253 --> 00:53:37,630
Hansel!

995
00:53:37,755 --> 00:53:38,715
Hansel, wake up.

00:53:38,841 --> 00:53:39,842
Wake up!

997
00:53:39,968 --> 00:53:41,053
What's happening?

998
00:53:41,178 --> 00:53:44,392
I don't know, but I'm scared.

999
00:53:52,531 --> 00:53:58,291
Well, we are so out of here.

RAVEN: Uh, uh, uh.

00:54:04,134 --> 00:54:05,220
I wouldn't do that

00:54:09,268 --> 00:54:10,521
OK, keep on going.

I'm just trying to help.

Who is that?

Hey, kid, just leave the
window alone, all right?

1006
00:54:18,868 --> 00:54:19,828
Get back in bed.

1007
00:54:19,954 --> 00:54:21,414
Go to sleep.

1008
00:54:21,540 --> 00:54:23,668
Old girl doesn't take too
kindly to the main course

1009
00:54:23,794 --> 00:54:25,463
trying to make a run for it.

1010
00:54:25,588 --> 00:54:27,133
A talking raven.

1011
00:54:27,258 --> 00:54:29,387
Kid, you're in a magic forest.

1012
00:54:29,512 --> 00:54:30,555
Talking ravens?

We're a dime a dozen.

The fun's just starting.

00:54:39,738 --> 00:54:41,658
It tires me
unnecessarily to have

00:54:41,783 --> 00:54:43,911
to chase down my next meal.

1018
00:54:44,037 --> 00:54:45,038
You're not going to eat us?

Oh, yes, indeed I am.

The main course bratwurst.

I'm not against seeing
raven on the menu.

All right, knock
yourself out, chef.

Sandman.

00:55:38,924 --> 00:55:40,510
I've got something that--

there you are.

What are you doing?

1044
00:55:47,898 --> 00:55:52,280
Putting myself

1046
00:55:58,207 --> 00:56:00,002
I found them.

Is that you, mommy?

1052
00:56:10,938 --> 00:56:17,115
I said my prayers and I went
potty, just like you told me.

Oh, yes, sure.

1280
01:09:38,380 --> 01:09:41,427
And bears don't show up
on my father's doorstep.

1281
01:09:41,553 --> 01:09:42,262
But--

1282
01:09:42,387 --> 01:09:43,849
Back off!

1283
01:09:43,973 --> 01:09:44,976
Back it up!

1284
01:09:45,100 --> 01:09:48,440
Back, ba-- I said back, back!

1285
01:09:48,565 --> 01:09:52,739
I said back it up!

1286
01:10:01,713 --> 01:10:02,464
See?

1287
01:10:02,589 --> 01:10:03,340
Perfect fit.

1288
01:10:03,466 --> 01:10:05,970
And quite comfy too.

1289
01:10:06,096 --> 01:10:06,847
Certainly is.

1290
01:10:06,972 --> 01:10:07,807
Hang on tight!

1291
01:10:13,567 --> 01:10:15,194
Bam!

1292
01:10:15,320 --> 01:10:16,071
Sandman!

1293
01:10:16,196 --> 01:10:18,200
Wood faerie!

1294
01:10:18,325 --> 01:10:19,201
But it's nighttime.

1295
01:10:19,327 --> 01:10:20,662
How can you be here?

1296
01:10:20,787 --> 01:10:23,209
I, uh, delegated.

1297
01:10:23,333 --> 01:10:24,126
Or--

1298
01:10:26,631 --> 01:10:27,800
Not a word to anyone, kid.

1299
01:10:31,222 --> 01:10:33,936
Lights out.

1300
01:10:34,060 --> 01:10:35,521
OK, everybody, let's go!

1301
01:10:39,027 --> 01:10:40,154
I'm with you.

1302
01:10:40,280 --> 01:10:41,406
Let's get out of here.

1303
01:10:44,537 --> 01:10:45,246
Nice shorts.

1304
01:10:48,169 --> 01:10:50,297
Not so fast, my pretty.

1305
01:10:54,596 --> 01:10:55,597
Get out!

1306
01:10:55,723 --> 01:10:57,309
Then what?

1307
01:10:57,434 --> 01:11:00,356
She's right.

1308
01:11:00,481 --> 01:11:03,486
We must stand together.

1309
01:11:03,612 --> 01:11:05,657
HANSEL: Gretel,
witches hate water!

1310
01:11:05,782 --> 01:11:09,330
The raven told me.

1311
01:11:09,456 --> 01:11:10,666
Uh, the wands.

1312
01:11:10,791 --> 01:11:11,584
Give me the wands.

1313
01:11:14,046 --> 01:11:16,092
You ready?

1314
01:11:16,217 --> 01:11:18,262
Kick the bucket, Sandman!

1315
01:11:18,387 --> 01:11:19,222
Oh no!

1316
01:11:19,347 --> 01:11:21,309
Not the water!

1317
01:11:21,434 --> 01:11:23,480
Oh-ya!

1318
01:11:24,982 --> 01:11:27,570
First, a house falls on
my sister, and now this!

1319
01:11:40,885 --> 01:11:43,473
Pretty good.

1320
01:11:43,597 --> 01:11:46,019
Wood faerie, take
Gretel, get her out.

1321
01:11:46,144 --> 01:11:47,437
I'll take care of Hansel.

1322
01:11:47,563 --> 01:11:48,982
OK.

1323
01:11:49,107 --> 01:11:49,984
Hey, Hansel?

1324
01:11:57,246 --> 01:12:00,920
OK, hey-- um, come on, Hansel.

1325
01:12:01,045 --> 01:12:02,547
HANSEL: I can't move.

1326
01:12:02,673 --> 01:12:04,426
I'm too fat.

1327
01:12:04,550 --> 01:12:07,723
Uh, not a problem.

1328
01:12:13,149 --> 01:12:14,360
All right, OK.

1329
01:12:14,485 --> 01:12:16,697
We're on a roll, and--

1330
01:12:18,241 --> 01:12:19,117
Strike!

1331
01:12:22,040 --> 01:12:23,209
You OK, Hansel?
- You OK?

1332
01:12:23,333 --> 01:12:24,460
- OK, buddy.
- Come on.

1333
01:12:24,586 --> 01:12:25,670
Help you up.

1334
01:12:25,796 --> 01:12:27,674
Hansel?

1335
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:29,386
Gretel, is that you?

1336
01:12:29,510 --> 01:12:30,304
Father!

1337
01:12:30,429 --> 01:12:31,723
Father!

1338
01:12:31,849 --> 01:12:33,017
Is that really you?

1339
01:12:33,142 --> 01:12:33,935
Ah.

1340
01:12:34,060 --> 01:12:34,853
Father.

1341
01:12:37,274 --> 01:12:39,529
Hansel, what happened?

1342
01:12:39,653 --> 01:12:40,739
Oh, father.

1343
01:12:40,864 --> 01:12:43,159
We had this terrible
adventure, we did.

1344
01:12:43,285 --> 01:12:45,455
Stepmother, she took us
into the forest to lose us,

1345
01:12:45,580 --> 01:12:47,709
and we were trapped by a troll--

1346
01:12:47,834 --> 01:12:51,382
And this evil witch came
and, and tried to eat Hansel.

1347
01:12:51,507 --> 01:12:52,885
But Sandman and wood
faerie saved us.

1348
01:12:53,010 --> 01:12:53,719
Ahh.

1349
01:12:53,845 --> 01:12:54,637
It's true, father!

1350
01:12:54,763 --> 01:12:55,556
It's all really true.

1351
01:12:55,681 --> 01:12:56,474
Of course it is, Gretel.

1352
01:12:56,599 --> 01:12:57,309
Tell him!

1353
01:12:57,434 --> 01:12:58,645
Tell him it's all true.

1354
01:12:58,770 --> 01:13:00,857
But, it, uh, it won't
make a difference.

1355
01:13:00,982 --> 01:13:01,984
He can't see us.

1356
01:13:02,109 --> 01:13:04,279
No, no grown ups can see us.

1357
01:13:04,405 --> 01:13:07,452
We are just, uh, um--

1358
01:13:14,923 --> 01:13:18,721
Gretel, are you all right?

1359
01:13:18,846 --> 01:13:20,850
Ah, well, you two, come.

1360
01:13:20,975 --> 01:13:22,310
Let's go.

1361
01:13:22,436 --> 01:13:23,897
I've been looking for you
for days, worried sick.

1362
01:13:24,022 --> 01:13:24,857
Let's go home.

1363
01:13:24,982 --> 01:13:27,653
BOTH: What about stepmother?

1364
01:13:27,779 --> 01:13:28,572
Uh--

1365
01:13:31,910 --> 01:13:33,413
What on earth are you doing?

1366
01:13:37,045 --> 01:13:38,463
And where have you been?

1367
01:13:38,589 --> 01:13:40,968
There is a sink full of
dishes that needs washing.

1368
01:13:41,093 --> 01:13:43,097
What are you doing?

1369
01:13:43,222 --> 01:13:48,273
Something I should have done a
long time ago, darling dearest.

1370
01:13:48,397 --> 01:13:50,401
Oh, don't you
darling dearest me.

1371
01:13:50,526 --> 01:13:51,946
I've been sitting
in there all day

1372
01:13:52,070 --> 01:13:53,365
without a thing to eat or drink.

1373
01:13:53,490 --> 01:13:55,577
I could pass out at any moment.

1374
01:13:55,702 --> 01:13:58,666
I have low blood sugar.

1375
01:13:59,834 --> 01:14:02,005
Don't point your finger at me.

1376
01:14:02,130 --> 01:14:06,930
I said, don't point
your finger at me!

1377
01:14:07,055 --> 01:14:07,848
Excuse me, love birds.

1378
01:14:07,973 --> 01:14:09,726
I just need this.

1379
01:14:09,852 --> 01:14:11,313
Thank you!

1380
01:14:11,437 --> 01:14:12,147
No!

1381
01:14:12,273 --> 01:14:13,399
My locket!

1382
01:14:13,525 --> 01:14:14,401
Oh!

1383
01:14:14,526 --> 01:14:16,363
Oh, my ticket to the good life!

1384
01:14:16,488 --> 01:14:18,617
Troll, do something!

1385
01:14:18,742 --> 01:14:20,161
What?

1386
01:14:20,286 --> 01:14:21,997
What do you want me to do?

1387
01:14:22,123 --> 01:14:24,210
Out of my way!

1388
01:14:24,335 --> 01:14:25,587
Come back, you gold digger!

1389
01:14:25,713 --> 01:14:28,050
Please don't go.

1390
01:14:28,175 --> 01:14:29,386
Come back!

1391
01:14:29,510 --> 01:14:32,182
Bye-bye, darling dearest.

1392
01:14:47,166 --> 01:14:49,879
Well, I don't think
there will be anybody else.

1393
01:14:50,005 --> 01:14:52,050
At least, not right away.

1394
01:14:52,175 --> 01:14:54,846
But I have my daughter and my
son back, and that is enough,

1395
01:14:54,972 --> 01:14:55,723
yeah?

1396
01:14:55,848 --> 01:14:57,059
Well, it'll have to be.

1397
01:14:57,183 --> 01:14:58,019
We have no money.

1398
01:14:58,143 --> 01:14:59,688
Ah, but we will manage.

1399
01:14:59,813 --> 01:15:00,899
RAVEN: Heads up!

1400
01:15:01,023 --> 01:15:02,401
It's mother's locket!

1401
01:15:03,612 --> 01:15:05,365
Oh, thank you!

1402
01:15:05,490 --> 01:15:06,867
No, thank you.

1403
01:15:06,992 --> 01:15:10,874
Consider it payment for
smoking the old witch.

1404
01:15:15,757 --> 01:15:17,510
I have you now.

1405
01:15:30,199 --> 01:15:31,619
I'll be back!

1406
01:15:57,330 --> 01:15:59,583
Will I ever see you again?

1407
01:15:59,709 --> 01:16:00,586
In your dreams.

1408
01:16:09,100 --> 01:16:09,935
Go ahead.

1409
01:16:20,662 --> 01:16:21,580
Can we go home now?

1410
01:16:30,387 --> 01:16:31,472
Now we can go home.

1411
01:16:34,019 --> 01:16:34,812
Come.

1412
01:16:58,102 --> 01:17:01,357
"And they all lived
happily ever after.

1413
01:17:01,483 --> 01:17:02,359
The end."

1414
01:17:04,863 --> 01:17:06,992
ANDREW: That was a
pretty cool story, dad.

1415
01:17:07,117 --> 01:17:09,872
Yeah, I liked it too, honey.

1416
01:17:09,997 --> 01:17:11,416
Gretel was brave, wasn't she?

1417
01:17:11,542 --> 01:17:14,339
She was very brave.

1418
01:17:14,463 --> 01:17:15,966
OK, you two.

1419
01:17:16,092 --> 01:17:17,719
Time to sleep.

1420
01:17:17,845 --> 01:17:18,805
Goodnight, dad.

1421
01:17:18,930 --> 01:17:19,806
Goodnight, buddy.

1422
01:17:19,932 --> 01:17:20,766
There you go.

1423
01:17:20,892 --> 01:17:21,726
OK.

1424
01:17:24,523 --> 01:17:25,733
Daddy?

1425
01:17:25,859 --> 01:17:28,112
Hm?

1426
01:17:28,237 --> 01:17:29,197
You can turn the light out.

1427
01:17:41,093 --> 01:17:42,179
Goodnight.

1428
01:17:48,523 --> 01:17:49,983
Goodnight, you two.

1429
01:17:50,109 --> 01:17:53,532
Sleep tight, sweet dreams.

1430
01:17:53,656 --> 01:17:56,369
Always remember your
father loves you,

1431
01:17:56,495 --> 01:17:58,165
and your mother
would be very proud.

1432
01:18:06,679 --> 01:18:07,639
Trolls?

1433
01:18:07,765 --> 01:18:08,683
The Boogeyman?

1434
01:18:08,808 --> 01:18:10,019
Sandman?

1435
01:18:10,143 --> 01:18:11,605
Give me a break.

1436
01:18:11,729 --> 01:18:12,982
I liked it.

1437
01:18:13,107 --> 01:18:16,696
You are so six years old.

1438
01:18:25,003 --> 01:18:25,754
Hello.

1439
01:18:25,879 --> 01:18:27,549
I just, um, excuse me.

1440
01:18:27,674 --> 01:18:29,302
I just-- oh!

1441
01:18:29,427 --> 01:18:30,179
Let me just, oh!

1442
01:18:30,303 --> 01:18:31,889
There it is.

1443
01:18:32,015 --> 01:18:33,852
Just came back for this, because
somebody must have dropped it.

1444
01:18:33,976 --> 01:18:35,312
All right.
Well, that's--

1445
01:18:35,437 --> 01:18:36,272
Sorry.

1446
01:18:36,397 --> 01:18:40,446
I see fairy tale people.

1447
01:18:40,572 --> 01:18:42,575
You know, the witch
wanted to come along,

1448
01:18:42,700 --> 01:18:45,163
and then I, I thought, bad idea.

1449
01:18:45,288 --> 01:18:46,623
WITCH: I heard that!

1450
01:18:46,749 --> 01:18:50,505
Oh, shut up, you old witch!

1451
01:18:50,630 --> 01:18:52,258
You're all real.

1452
01:18:52,383 --> 01:18:53,760
Duh, of course we are.

1453
01:18:53,886 --> 01:18:56,390
Where do you think the Grimm
boys got their stories?

1454
01:18:56,516 --> 01:18:57,935
Wait a sec, you
didn't think they

1455
01:18:58,060 --> 01:19:00,105
just made them up, did you?

1456
01:19:00,230 --> 01:19:02,652
You mean to tell
me that you actually

1457
01:19:02,776 --> 01:19:04,029
knew the Grimm brothers?

1458
01:19:04,153 --> 01:19:05,197
Yeah, both sets.

1459
01:19:05,323 --> 01:19:06,658
You betcha.

1460
01:19:06,783 --> 01:19:07,993
Well, obviously, we were
a lot younger back then.

1461
01:19:08,119 --> 01:19:10,623
And the troll
even-- he had hair.

1462
01:19:10,749 --> 01:19:11,458
It's true.

1463
01:19:11,583 --> 01:19:12,460
I did.

1464
01:19:12,585 --> 01:19:13,920
Ha ha ha.
Look at that.

1465
01:19:14,046 --> 01:19:14,923
That's me.

1466
01:19:17,427 --> 01:19:19,973
I mean, those guys got
all their ideas from us,

1467
01:19:20,098 --> 01:19:21,267
and we never saw a penny.

1468
01:19:21,392 --> 01:19:23,520
No story rights, no
international sales,

1469
01:19:23,646 --> 01:19:24,773
merchandising, nada.

1470
01:19:24,898 --> 01:19:25,608
Zippo.

1471
01:19:25,733 --> 01:19:26,735
Nothing.

1472
01:19:26,860 --> 01:19:27,903
Come off it.

1473
01:19:28,029 --> 01:19:29,949
They're fairy tales,
made-up stories

1474
01:19:30,073 --> 01:19:31,368
to keep children in line.

1475
01:19:31,493 --> 01:19:33,622
Nobody actually
believes that stuff.

1476
01:19:33,747 --> 01:19:34,790
All right, then.

1477
01:19:34,916 --> 01:19:35,792
Sleep on it.

1478
01:19:40,342 --> 01:19:42,805
Are you ready?

1479
01:19:42,929 --> 01:19:46,060
Will you come
back tomorrow night?

1480
01:19:46,185 --> 01:19:48,982
Every night.

1481
01:19:57,789 --> 01:19:58,665
OK, boys.

1482
01:20:09,726 --> 01:20:13,440
And that goes for
everyone else too.

1483
01:20:13,566 --> 01:20:14,485
Nighty night.

1484
01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:23,792
Not!

1485
01:20:23,917 --> 01:20:25,920
Oh!

1486
01:20:26,046 --> 01:20:30,136
Well, talk about
your fixer upper.

1487
01:20:30,262 --> 01:20:32,725
Well, you know what they say.

1488
01:20:32,849 --> 01:20:36,606
Location, location, location.
