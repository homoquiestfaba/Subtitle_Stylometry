1
00:00:24,886 --> 00:00:26,184
Here you go, darling.

2
00:00:27,288 --> 00:00:28,688
But where are yours?

3
00:00:31,092 --> 00:00:33,823
The magic of Christmas
is a child's making a wish,

4
00:00:34,028 --> 00:00:35,587
and it coming true.

5
00:00:36,698 --> 00:00:38,132
Go ahead, Ayden.

6
00:00:38,533 --> 00:00:41,002
We'll share whatever it is, all right?

7
00:00:41,569 --> 00:00:42,696
All right.

8
00:00:46,874 --> 00:00:48,172
For a kite!

9
00:00:50,945 --> 00:00:52,937
Thank you, thank you!

10
00:00:53,314 --> 00:00:56,443
Well don't thank us.
Thank Father Christmas.

11
00:00:59,254 --> 00:01:00,381
Thank you.

12
00:01:29,417 --> 00:01:31,409
There he is.

13
00:01:39,894 --> 00:01:41,157
Gazared.

14
00:01:41,663 --> 00:01:42,653
Born tall.

15
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:44,796
Taxes.

16
00:01:45,933 --> 00:01:48,698
I seem to recall after giving
you last year's payment

17
00:01:48,803 --> 00:01:51,136
not all of it reached Lord Rockfort.

18
00:01:51,506 --> 00:01:54,738
And I had men even more foul
than you show at my door.

19
00:01:54,876 --> 00:01:58,210
I'm not to blame, you can imagine.

20
00:01:59,147 --> 00:02:02,242
Do you still from every person
you collect, or just us?

21
00:02:03,251 --> 00:02:07,313
Are you going to give me the payment
or do you need persuading?

22
00:02:07,622 --> 00:02:09,420
I'm not giving you anything.

23
00:02:09,991 --> 00:02:12,893
I shall deliver my payment
to Lord Rockfort himself.

24
00:02:13,895 --> 00:02:17,662
I don't think our lord visits
many men in the dungeon.

25
00:02:17,832 --> 00:02:19,198
Arrest him!

26
00:02:34,849 --> 00:02:36,181
No!

27
00:02:37,185 --> 00:02:38,744
All right!

28
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:39,913
All right.

29
00:02:40,088 --> 00:02:41,021
Enough.

30
00:02:43,257 --> 00:02:44,589
I'll get the money.

31
00:02:45,693 --> 00:02:46,661
Just don't hurt her.

32
00:02:46,728 --> 00:02:48,890
I wouldn't dream of hurting her.

33
00:02:49,464 --> 00:02:53,060
Not when I can get such a fair price
for another child in the mines.

34
00:02:53,167 --> 00:02:54,692
Get them in the wagon.

35
00:02:54,936 --> 00:02:56,666
No! No!

36
00:02:57,739 --> 00:02:59,332
Ayden, run!

37
00:02:59,774 --> 00:03:00,833
Stop fighting.

38
00:03:01,209 --> 00:03:02,074
Run!

39
00:03:04,912 --> 00:03:06,403
Into the wagon.

40
00:03:51,893 --> 00:03:53,452
Forget the girl.

41
00:03:53,795 --> 00:03:56,731
We'll make 10 times as much
from just one of these dragon eggs.

42
00:03:57,899 --> 00:04:00,300
You, girl. Give us the eggs.

43
00:04:00,635 --> 00:04:02,263
No! I won't!

44
00:04:04,672 --> 00:04:05,662
Come on, girl.

45
00:04:15,616 --> 00:04:18,518
D-d-d-d-dragon!

46
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:25,388
Ayden!

47
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:37,463
Get down!

48
00:04:39,273 --> 00:04:40,969
Ayden!

49
00:05:00,728 --> 00:05:02,924
Gazared! Set us free.

50
00:05:03,498 --> 00:05:05,433
Gazared, don't be a coward!

51
00:05:07,869 --> 00:05:09,132
Ayden!

52
00:05:10,538 --> 00:05:11,369
Let's go!

53
00:05:16,444 --> 00:05:17,707
Watch it, watch it!

54
00:05:21,749 --> 00:05:23,615
No! No!

55
00:05:40,368 --> 00:05:41,700
Get away!

56
00:05:44,272 --> 00:05:45,706
Ayden!

57
00:05:46,807 --> 00:05:47,536
No.

58
00:05:55,716 --> 00:05:56,649
She's safe.

59
00:06:45,232 --> 00:06:47,326
I'll get your fresh pickled ginger.

60
00:06:59,814 --> 00:07:00,679
Thank you.

61
00:07:11,826 --> 00:07:15,058
He brandished his sword
to face the ferocious dragon.

62
00:07:15,229 --> 00:07:19,690
The battle was fierce, sword was...

63
00:07:19,867 --> 00:07:24,430
And they battled from sunup until
sundown until finally the dragon fell.

64
00:07:24,572 --> 00:07:26,302
The knight was victorious.

65
00:07:26,474 --> 00:07:28,670
The villagers cheered,
"We love you!"

66
00:07:51,265 --> 00:07:52,699
You'll be safe here.

67
00:07:53,267 --> 00:07:55,827
I brought you some worms, too,
for your wrist.

68
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:58,833
Stay off of that one until
you feel better.

69
00:07:59,073 --> 00:08:00,871
Where did you learn to do that?

70
00:08:00,975 --> 00:08:03,274
My mother taught me when
I was about your age.

71
00:08:06,981 --> 00:08:08,279
What is it?

72
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:10,779
Dragons.

73
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:38,072
No, Come on, we need to go.

74
00:08:44,418 --> 00:08:45,613
Come on, come on.

75
00:08:53,127 --> 00:08:55,221
Wait, wait, wait for us! We're here.

76
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:56,792
We're here.

77
00:08:57,064 --> 00:08:58,896
Hurry. Hurry!

78
00:09:00,034 --> 00:09:02,299
I would expect you to
take the warning bells

79
00:09:02,503 --> 00:09:04,495
a little more seriously, Ayden.

80
00:09:04,605 --> 00:09:07,336
Especially with what happened
to your parents.

81
00:09:07,508 --> 00:09:08,771
I'm sorry, Sister Lenora.

82
00:09:08,943 --> 00:09:11,071
Now go find the twins and
make sure they're shuttering

83
00:09:11,245 --> 00:09:14,511
the windows properly instead
of hanging out of them.

84
00:09:14,782 --> 00:09:16,512
And bring them down for supper.

85
00:09:16,817 --> 00:09:18,183
- Can you see anything?
- No, I can't.

86
00:09:18,285 --> 00:09:19,719
- Where is it?
- I don't know.

87
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:22,756
- Scoot over!
- No, you! I can't see.

88
00:09:24,925 --> 00:09:29,260
Would you two knock it off and close
that thing before you get us all cooked?

89
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:31,522
You're not the boss of us.

90
00:09:32,032 --> 00:09:32,897
Yeah?

91
00:09:35,102 --> 00:09:35,797
Hey!

92
00:09:35,903 --> 00:09:37,428
You could have killed us!

93
00:09:38,806 --> 00:09:40,331
Prepare to die!

94
00:09:42,409 --> 00:09:44,935
Don't be silly, Ayden.
You're safe here.

95
00:09:45,112 --> 00:09:46,740
Talking to yourself again?

96
00:09:47,715 --> 00:09:48,808
No...

97
00:09:49,817 --> 00:09:50,750
I was...

98
00:09:50,885 --> 00:09:53,753
Shouldn't be such a It's very...

99
00:09:53,854 --> 00:09:55,322
Roslyn!

100
00:09:56,056 --> 00:09:57,490
- You were saying?
- Garret.

101
00:09:58,526 --> 00:09:59,789
Don't pick on Ayden.

102
00:09:59,927 --> 00:10:01,862
Sister Lenora says supper's ready.

103
00:10:04,098 --> 00:10:05,532
Hey!

104
00:10:19,513 --> 00:10:21,880
- Oh...
- That is not fair.

105
00:10:22,116 --> 00:10:23,914
The smell is awful!

106
00:10:24,185 --> 00:10:25,983
Finn! Hoyt! What are you doing?

107
00:10:28,689 --> 00:10:29,782
Nothing?

108
00:10:30,391 --> 00:10:33,691
We're just cleaning up for supper.

109
00:10:34,528 --> 00:10:35,689
It's ready.

110
00:11:08,829 --> 00:11:10,058
What is it, Ayden?

111
00:11:10,464 --> 00:11:13,992
Oh. Just your stocking hanging
on the fireplace.

112
00:11:14,702 --> 00:11:17,103
It reminded me of Father Christmas.

113
00:11:17,171 --> 00:11:17,900
Who?

114
00:11:18,138 --> 00:11:19,663
Who's Father Christmas?

115
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:21,936
- No one but a fairytale.
- That's not true.

116
00:11:22,276 --> 00:11:24,768
He's real, and he's wonderful.

117
00:11:25,846 --> 00:11:26,870
Ayden's right.

118
00:11:27,147 --> 00:11:29,582
Well, at least partially.

119
00:11:30,384 --> 00:11:34,116
Many years ago, even before
Sister Lenora was born,

120
00:11:34,622 --> 00:11:38,684
there was a man named Nicholas
who lived in a village not far from here.

121
00:11:39,293 --> 00:11:41,819
When his neighbors needed money
for their daughter's wedding,

122
00:11:41,896 --> 00:11:44,525
he gifted it to them by dropping
it down their chimney.

123
00:11:44,698 --> 00:11:46,098
So no one would know it was him.

124
00:11:46,267 --> 00:11:47,860
I remember this story.

125
00:11:48,435 --> 00:11:50,631
After seeing how happy
his neighbors were,

126
00:11:50,771 --> 00:11:54,139
he decided that was the way
he wanted to live his life.

127
00:11:54,408 --> 00:11:56,809
Bringing joy to the lives
of other people.

128
00:11:56,977 --> 00:12:00,505
He spent his nights making secret
deliveries to those in need.

129
00:12:00,915 --> 00:12:03,976
And even though helping
grownups was good,

130
00:12:04,385 --> 00:12:07,378
what made Nicholas happiest
was seeing the smiles

131
00:12:07,554 --> 00:12:10,490
on the children's faces
when their wishes came true.

132
00:12:10,658 --> 00:12:12,786
But how did he become
Father Christmas?

133
00:12:13,527 --> 00:12:14,790
Well he started making a list

134
00:12:15,029 --> 00:12:17,021
of all the children that were
good and deserved a present.

135
00:12:17,131 --> 00:12:18,292
Not just in his town,

136
00:12:18,432 --> 00:12:22,301
but in every town he visited.
And soon, the list got so long,

137
00:12:22,469 --> 00:12:24,768
that it took a whole year
to make all the gifts.

138
00:12:24,939 --> 00:12:27,431
And then he chose a special night
to deliver them on.

139
00:12:27,908 --> 00:12:29,035
Christmas.

140
00:12:29,109 --> 00:12:30,577
That sounds familiar.

141
00:12:30,811 --> 00:12:31,779
Is Christmas real?

142
00:12:32,446 --> 00:12:33,106
When is it?

143
00:12:33,247 --> 00:12:35,614
It's real.
It's less than a week away.

144
00:12:35,783 --> 00:12:38,947
And now his list includes
every child in the whole world!

145
00:12:39,286 --> 00:12:40,777
So you'd better be good.

146
00:12:42,189 --> 00:12:45,353
And just how does he travel
around the whole entire world

147
00:12:45,492 --> 00:12:47,825
and visit every child in one night?

148
00:12:48,128 --> 00:12:49,528
He uses magic.

149
00:12:49,964 --> 00:12:50,897
Really.

150
00:12:51,966 --> 00:12:53,662
Well he must have lost it, then.

151
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:58,667
There haven't been presents
in any stockings for years now.

152
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:01,368
Isn't that right, Finn?

153
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:05,502
Why hasn't Father Christmas
been seen in years?

154
00:13:05,612 --> 00:13:07,672
Why haven't we ever had
a Christmas here?

155
00:13:08,182 --> 00:13:10,151
Well maybe it's because
we don't believe.

156
00:13:10,684 --> 00:13:12,653
We need to believe that he'll come.

157
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:15,615
Make a wish in your heart
for him to answer.

158
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:19,819
I think it's cruel
that you're getting their hopes up.

159
00:13:20,494 --> 00:13:21,860
I don't want any part of it.

160
00:13:29,236 --> 00:13:31,831
Don't worry. I'll talk to her.

161
00:13:35,909 --> 00:13:37,673
We wish for a...

162
00:13:38,112 --> 00:13:41,514
Make it silent.
So only he can hear it.

163
00:13:51,792 --> 00:13:54,591
We need to show Father Christmas
that we believe.

164
00:13:54,728 --> 00:13:57,789
You don't have to.
He can see it in your heart.

165
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:01,665
What if we made him something?

166
00:14:04,171 --> 00:14:05,833
We should make him a wreath.

167
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:07,221
We can hang it on the door,

168
00:14:07,274 --> 00:14:08,914
and that way he'll know
that he's welcome.

169
00:14:09,476 --> 00:14:11,274
Here.
You keep gathering firewood,

170
00:14:11,378 --> 00:14:14,371
and I'm going to look for some
leaves and holly berries.

171
00:14:25,292 --> 00:14:26,351
Hello?

172
00:14:30,931 --> 00:14:32,126
Hello?

173
00:14:37,871 --> 00:14:38,895
Hello?

174
00:14:42,476 --> 00:14:44,377
What are you looking for?

175
00:14:44,545 --> 00:14:46,673
Oh only holly berries and leaves.

176
00:14:47,247 --> 00:14:49,113
Holly berries are poisonous.

177
00:14:49,216 --> 00:14:50,548
They're not for eating.

178
00:14:50,751 --> 00:14:54,153
We're making a wreath.
For Father Christmas.

179
00:14:55,489 --> 00:14:58,550
There is not going to be
a Christmas, child.

180
00:14:58,792 --> 00:15:02,354
Not this year.
Perhaps never again.

181
00:15:02,896 --> 00:15:04,091
How would you know?

182
00:15:05,699 --> 00:15:06,894
Can't you feel it?

183
00:15:09,503 --> 00:15:10,266
It's gone.

184
00:15:10,604 --> 00:15:11,628
What's gone?

185
00:15:11,772 --> 00:15:12,762
The magic.

186
00:15:13,874 --> 00:15:15,274
It's gone out of us.

187
00:15:16,076 --> 00:15:19,774
And all good things are turning bad.

188
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:24,247
Yes.

189
00:15:24,885 --> 00:15:25,818
I know.

190
00:15:27,387 --> 00:15:28,855
I'm not pretty.

191
00:15:29,723 --> 00:15:31,055
But I once was.

192
00:15:33,827 --> 00:15:35,659
You're... you're an elf?

193
00:15:36,029 --> 00:15:37,520
What happened to you?

194
00:15:38,966 --> 00:15:43,768
There's a darkness in the north.
Father Christmas is dying.

195
00:15:44,505 --> 00:15:47,634
He sent us to find the magic.

196
00:15:47,908 --> 00:15:50,605
But he didn't realize how quickly
the elves were turning...

197
00:15:50,777 --> 00:15:53,804
I only made it
this far because of this.

198
00:15:54,748 --> 00:15:55,875
What is that?

199
00:15:56,817 --> 00:15:58,217
It's a way-stone.

200
00:15:59,219 --> 00:16:00,653
A compass.

201
00:16:01,655 --> 00:16:06,286
It was meant to guide me to the magic,
but instead it led me to you.

202
00:16:07,861 --> 00:16:08,658
Why me?

203
00:16:09,763 --> 00:16:10,662
Ayden!

204
00:16:11,465 --> 00:16:13,457
I don't know.

205
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:16,033
But I believe
you are meant to have it.

206
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:18,538
Once you take it,

207
00:16:18,872 --> 00:16:22,331
there will be nothing left
to keep the snow from taking me.

208
00:16:22,743 --> 00:16:24,609
I don't understand. Why...

209
00:16:25,812 --> 00:16:27,212
Follow the compass.

210
00:16:27,714 --> 00:16:29,546
Find the magic.

211
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:31,650
Save Christmas.

212
00:16:31,785 --> 00:16:35,745
I can't do that.
I can't do it by myself.

213
00:16:43,664 --> 00:16:44,893
Come on, we've got to go!

214
00:16:45,232 --> 00:16:46,097
Why?

215
00:16:46,266 --> 00:16:47,734
- What is it Ayden?
- Come on!

216
00:16:56,810 --> 00:16:57,743
Sorry.

217
00:16:57,844 --> 00:16:59,073
Animals!

218
00:16:59,446 --> 00:17:01,813
Why is everybody always
running in this place?

219
00:17:02,849 --> 00:17:03,646
Ayden!

220
00:17:04,952 --> 00:17:06,318
What is it?

221
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:08,652
What's wrong?

222
00:17:09,389 --> 00:17:10,755
What is it?

223
00:17:11,658 --> 00:17:12,819
Are you all right?

224
00:17:12,993 --> 00:17:13,833
What's going on here?

225
00:17:14,027 --> 00:17:15,655
I need to make sure
no one's listening.

226
00:17:18,832 --> 00:17:20,698
- What are you doing?
- What's gong on?

227
00:17:21,068 --> 00:17:23,537
Come on, Ayden.

228
00:17:23,704 --> 00:17:24,204
What is it?

229
00:17:24,471 --> 00:17:25,632
Ayden,

230
00:17:25,772 --> 00:17:27,573
- what's going on?
- Tell us what's happening.

231
00:17:28,308 --> 00:17:29,742
As I've told you many times before,

232
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:33,074
we don't bid them out until
they become of age.

233
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:36,846
I mean, even orphans
deserve to be children.

234
00:17:37,084 --> 00:17:38,017
All right.

235
00:17:38,185 --> 00:17:39,949
We'll take one before
we leave town tomorrow,

236
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:42,451
and we'll back for
the other next week.

237
00:17:44,725 --> 00:17:46,626
I have something to show you.

238
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:51,823
It's important.

239
00:17:59,473 --> 00:18:02,102
So you met a real live elf?

240
00:18:02,509 --> 00:18:03,499
Yes.

241
00:18:04,845 --> 00:18:09,579
And he told you Christmas
wasn't coming back this year.

242
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:12,413
Well not just this year,
maybe never.

243
00:18:12,586 --> 00:18:15,954
Unless you use this crystal
to find the missing magic?

244
00:18:16,156 --> 00:18:19,558
Well he called it a compass,
but yes.

245
00:18:21,862 --> 00:18:23,660
All right. I'm in.

246
00:18:23,897 --> 00:18:25,889
You really believe me just like that?

247
00:18:26,566 --> 00:18:30,662
I can't think of any better reason why
you'd have a magic glowing rock.

248
00:18:32,172 --> 00:18:33,731
So when so we leave?

249
00:18:35,609 --> 00:18:36,770
You're all crazy!

250
00:18:37,811 --> 00:18:39,746
You really want to get yourself lost

251
00:18:39,913 --> 00:18:43,441
and probably killed over a silly rock?

252
00:18:45,385 --> 00:18:48,753
You know what, you're more
than welcome to do it. Alone.

253
00:18:49,856 --> 00:18:52,587
No one invited you anyways.

254
00:18:54,661 --> 00:18:56,222
We'll leave first thing in the morning.

255
00:18:56,563 --> 00:18:58,930
But before you make your decisions,

256
00:18:59,766 --> 00:19:02,668
I want you to know that this
is not going to be easy.

257
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:05,468
We're going to be runaways.

258
00:19:05,806 --> 00:19:09,709
We're going to have no money,
no food, no shelter.

259
00:19:10,043 --> 00:19:11,568
All we have is this.

260
00:19:12,612 --> 00:19:14,774
And we don't even know
where it's taking us.

261
00:19:15,515 --> 00:19:17,177
We're going to find the lost magic.

262
00:19:17,284 --> 00:19:18,843
We're going to save Christmas!

263
00:19:22,289 --> 00:19:23,655
Roslyn's right.

264
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:26,821
You're all crazy.

265
00:19:30,897 --> 00:19:32,331
But of course I'll go.

266
00:19:35,869 --> 00:19:39,362
What are you all up to?

267
00:19:52,352 --> 00:19:53,752
It's almost supper.

268
00:19:57,724 --> 00:19:58,851
Go wash up.

269
00:20:26,853 --> 00:20:27,946
Hoyt,

270
00:20:37,631 --> 00:20:39,327
Did you make past the ogre OK?

271
00:20:39,533 --> 00:20:40,728
Yeah, just barely.

272
00:20:40,934 --> 00:20:41,697
Good.

273
00:20:41,868 --> 00:20:44,133
I don't want to come face
to face with her this early.

274
00:20:44,271 --> 00:20:46,035
Especially with her dragon breath.

275
00:20:46,573 --> 00:20:47,541
Where's Garret?

276
00:20:49,075 --> 00:20:50,907
Come on let's do this.

277
00:21:58,178 --> 00:21:59,407
Coming.

278
00:22:01,781 --> 00:22:02,908
I'm coming.

279
00:22:12,526 --> 00:22:13,653
You're early.

280
00:22:14,861 --> 00:22:16,420
Fetch the boy.

281
00:22:18,131 --> 00:22:20,828
Let me get you something
to drink first.

282
00:22:24,704 --> 00:22:26,138
What are we going to do now?

283
00:22:26,806 --> 00:22:28,104
I know another way.

284
00:22:28,575 --> 00:22:29,543
Follow me.

285
00:22:30,944 --> 00:22:32,810
Don't wake the other children.

286
00:22:44,591 --> 00:22:45,889
It's OVER 30 feet down.

287
00:22:46,026 --> 00:22:47,858
That's why we're not jumping.

288
00:23:00,574 --> 00:23:01,837
Come on come on come on!

289
00:23:02,943 --> 00:23:06,505
Come on, faster!
You're taking too long.

290
00:23:08,248 --> 00:23:09,807
Hurry up, come on!

291
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:12,044
Hoyt, wait,
I'm not down all the way.

292
00:23:16,156 --> 00:23:18,625
One at a time, you numbskulls.

293
00:23:23,196 --> 00:23:24,789
Ayden. Hurry.

294
00:23:30,971 --> 00:23:32,462
Garret come on.

295
00:23:32,973 --> 00:23:34,771
I can't leave without Roslyn.

296
00:23:35,208 --> 00:23:38,337
I'll buy you time by pulling up the blanket
so they won't know and catch you.

297
00:23:38,445 --> 00:23:40,505
If I don't meet you
by the edge of the woods,

298
00:23:41,247 --> 00:23:42,545
then go on without me.

299
00:23:42,749 --> 00:23:44,377
Garret, no!
We can't go without you!

300
00:23:44,551 --> 00:23:45,917
Yes, you can, Ayden.

301
00:23:46,486 --> 00:23:47,818
You must.

302
00:23:48,622 --> 00:23:49,954
Promise me you will.

303
00:23:51,458 --> 00:23:52,687
Promise.

304
00:23:56,696 --> 00:23:57,720
Garret?

305
00:24:00,634 --> 00:24:02,694
Now go. Hurry!

306
00:24:23,023 --> 00:24:24,082
Where's Garret?

307
00:24:24,391 --> 00:24:25,290
Oh.

308
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:31,862
He didn't make it out.

309
00:24:34,668 --> 00:24:36,694
He told me we have
to go on without him.

310
00:24:37,871 --> 00:24:39,703
He made me promise.

311
00:24:41,408 --> 00:24:42,671
I understand
if you want to go back...

312
00:24:42,809 --> 00:24:45,210
If it's a choice between
following your magic rock

313
00:24:45,378 --> 00:24:48,507
and facing the wrath of Sister Lenora
and Father Mendel,

314
00:24:48,581 --> 00:24:50,641
I'll take my chances with the rock.

315
00:24:52,686 --> 00:24:54,052
Which way do we go?

316
00:25:16,743 --> 00:25:18,575
I wish I knew where this thing
was taking us.

317
00:25:18,745 --> 00:25:19,644
That's easy.

318
00:25:19,713 --> 00:25:20,772
North.

319
00:25:21,581 --> 00:25:22,708
Well how do you know that?

320
00:25:23,016 --> 00:25:24,177
You can tell by the moss.

321
00:25:24,284 --> 00:25:26,048
It grows on the north side
of the trees.

322
00:25:26,352 --> 00:25:29,345
- Oh, that's pretty handy.
- Yeah. And at night...

323
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:37,991
It's probably just a squirrel
or something.

324
00:25:38,531 --> 00:25:41,524
Yeah. A squirrel.

325
00:25:42,469 --> 00:25:44,062
But we should stay together,

326
00:25:44,938 --> 00:25:46,304
just in case.

327
00:25:59,285 --> 00:26:01,220
I don't think we're alone
in these woods.

328
00:26:03,223 --> 00:26:04,623
I have an idea.

329
00:26:12,899 --> 00:26:14,731
Anytime now, Finn.

330
00:26:22,375 --> 00:26:23,308
No!

331
00:26:29,549 --> 00:26:30,812
Reveal yourself.

332
00:26:33,887 --> 00:26:35,116
Roslyn?

333
00:26:35,755 --> 00:26:37,018
What are you doing here?

334
00:26:37,724 --> 00:26:39,659
Let me down.

335
00:26:39,793 --> 00:26:42,228
No way. Sister Lenora could
have sent you.

336
00:26:42,328 --> 00:26:43,352
Cut me down!

337
00:26:43,496 --> 00:26:44,725
Is Garret with you?

338
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:49,234
I am not telling you anything
until you cut me down!

339
00:26:52,505 --> 00:26:54,337
What is wrong with you, Finn?

340
00:26:54,507 --> 00:26:55,702
Nothing's wrong with me.

341
00:26:55,975 --> 00:26:58,501
You're the one who's
stalking us through the woods.

342
00:26:58,745 --> 00:26:59,906
Now where's Garret?

343
00:27:02,415 --> 00:27:03,212
He's not coming.

344
00:27:03,383 --> 00:27:04,715
What do you mean?

345
00:27:04,818 --> 00:27:06,616
- Is he all right?
- No.

346
00:27:07,487 --> 00:27:08,716
He's not all right.

347
00:27:09,088 --> 00:27:11,023
Nothing is all right
right now, Ayden.

348
00:27:13,293 --> 00:27:16,092
We have to get moving.
They're after us.

349
00:27:16,663 --> 00:27:19,633
Not that way.
We're heading north.

350
00:27:22,135 --> 00:27:24,095
Well if you want to go north,
I know a faster way.

351
00:27:24,304 --> 00:27:25,272
The river.

352
00:27:25,905 --> 00:27:28,568
I assume you don't want
anyone following you?

353
00:27:28,675 --> 00:27:31,201
I couldn't imagine running
into anyone worse.

354
00:27:33,213 --> 00:27:37,810
Christmas is only four days away,
so the faster the better.

355
00:27:38,818 --> 00:27:40,946
See? What would you
do without me?

356
00:27:42,822 --> 00:27:43,790
Roslyn?

357
00:27:44,824 --> 00:27:46,019
It's that way.

358
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:48,159
Oh.

359
00:27:50,296 --> 00:27:54,233
Couldn't imagine Sister Lenora and
Father Mendel ever catching up with us.

360
00:28:00,506 --> 00:28:02,771
This is going to be much
faster than walking.

361
00:28:03,176 --> 00:28:05,202
How did you know this was here?

362
00:28:05,912 --> 00:28:09,610
Garret used to help Old Man Husker
haul his catch from here to the market.

363
00:28:10,316 --> 00:28:12,217
Isn't he going to miss his boat?

364
00:28:13,853 --> 00:28:15,321
Look at this thing.

365
00:28:15,788 --> 00:28:18,824
Hasn't been used in months,
maybe even years.

366
00:28:18,825 --> 00:28:20,760
No one is going to miss it.

367
00:28:31,905 --> 00:28:33,430
Is it lunchtime yet?

368
00:28:35,875 --> 00:28:37,741
It looks like about midday.

369
00:28:38,645 --> 00:28:39,772
What do we have to eat?

370
00:28:41,147 --> 00:28:42,274
Sorry.

371
00:28:43,016 --> 00:28:44,143
I got hungry.

372
00:28:45,218 --> 00:28:46,550
Seriously?

373
00:28:47,186 --> 00:28:49,621
How long did you think
we were going to be out here?

374
00:28:50,657 --> 00:28:51,590
Hey.

375
00:28:51,791 --> 00:28:53,589
What did you bring?

376
00:28:54,394 --> 00:28:56,954
I was in a hurry, OK?

377
00:28:57,864 --> 00:29:01,858
And I thought you would be smart enough
to bring more than just stinky cheese.

378
00:29:02,769 --> 00:29:04,829
You can do a lot with stinky cheese.

379
00:29:05,471 --> 00:29:07,235
Why don't we catch our own lunch?

380
00:29:09,876 --> 00:29:11,139
Good idea, Rand.

381
00:29:13,212 --> 00:29:14,544
You see?

382
00:29:14,647 --> 00:29:17,207
If we all work together
we can make it.

383
00:29:26,592 --> 00:29:28,788
What do you think
we're going to catch?

384
00:29:29,329 --> 00:29:31,025
This way you won't get wet.

385
00:29:40,606 --> 00:29:42,074
There's something in the water.

386
00:29:45,545 --> 00:29:46,342
Rand!

387
00:29:46,713 --> 00:29:47,544
Rand!

388
00:30:02,295 --> 00:30:04,423
It got me! It got me.

389
00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:06,021
Help me! Please!

390
00:30:06,132 --> 00:30:07,532
Something's on me!

391
00:30:09,369 --> 00:30:10,462
Grab on!

392
00:30:15,541 --> 00:30:16,839
Get him in, come on!

393
00:30:23,316 --> 00:30:25,945
Are you all right? What had you?

394
00:31:21,207 --> 00:31:22,698
That was raw.

395
00:31:23,009 --> 00:31:25,740
We traveled much faster than we
would have through your mossy trees.

396
00:31:29,749 --> 00:31:31,718
We should make a fire
and set up camp.

397
00:31:31,818 --> 00:31:32,808
It's gonna be dark soon.

398
00:31:32,985 --> 00:31:35,687
What if a dragon smells our smoke
and comes for us?

399
00:31:35,688 --> 00:31:37,452
I'd welcome some dragon fire.

400
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:39,691
Dragons always smell smoke.

401
00:31:39,692 --> 00:31:41,820
It's in their noses all the time.

402
00:31:42,028 --> 00:31:44,862
They won't be able to tell our
fire from their own.

403
00:31:45,465 --> 00:31:46,728
Trust me.

404
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:48,864
We still shouldn't build a fire.

405
00:31:49,769 --> 00:31:51,533
Why are you so scared, Roslyn?

406
00:31:51,704 --> 00:31:54,731
It's not like we've never been
caught and punished before.

407
00:32:03,749 --> 00:32:05,047
How does that thing work,
anyway?

408
00:32:05,184 --> 00:32:08,177
It has to be some kind of magic, right?

409
00:32:08,354 --> 00:32:10,687
My mother said the magic
of Christmas

410
00:32:11,023 --> 00:32:15,757
is a child making a wish
and it coming true.

411
00:32:15,862 --> 00:32:17,228
Mind if I see that?

412
00:32:29,342 --> 00:32:30,571
How did you do that?

413
00:32:30,743 --> 00:32:32,075
I just did what you said.

414
00:32:32,211 --> 00:32:35,875
I have the same Christmas wish
every year, to go on an adventure.

415
00:32:36,015 --> 00:32:39,543
I just thought about how I feel now
that it's finally coming true.

416
00:32:40,219 --> 00:32:41,653
Can we have it now?

417
00:32:41,754 --> 00:32:44,952
Rather not see what happens
after you two make a wish.

418
00:32:45,124 --> 00:32:45,989
Why not?

419
00:32:48,861 --> 00:32:50,693
Actually, you'd better
hold on to that.

420
00:32:52,865 --> 00:32:54,424
Roslyn, what was your wish?

421
00:32:56,135 --> 00:32:57,501
Nothing special.

422
00:32:58,371 --> 00:32:59,566
What about you?

423
00:33:00,473 --> 00:33:03,102
Well mine's not very original.

424
00:33:03,209 --> 00:33:05,110
An orphan wishing for a family.

425
00:33:05,178 --> 00:33:06,806
Welcome to the club.

426
00:34:00,433 --> 00:34:01,298
Roslyn?

427
00:34:03,836 --> 00:34:04,929
What are you doing here?

428
00:34:05,104 --> 00:34:07,335
I was about to ask you
the same question.

429
00:34:09,008 --> 00:34:11,136
I just wanted to see how lost
we really were.

430
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:16,806
There's something
you're not telling us.

431
00:34:17,450 --> 00:34:19,544
You've been acting really strange.

432
00:34:24,390 --> 00:34:26,052
Why did you come after us?

433
00:34:26,792 --> 00:34:28,693
Did something happen to Garret?

434
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:32,630
I know he means a lot to you.

435
00:34:32,698 --> 00:34:34,929
You have no idea what
you're talking about.

436
00:34:35,835 --> 00:34:37,531
He would be here if he could.

437
00:34:38,371 --> 00:34:39,703
What does that mean?

438
00:34:40,339 --> 00:34:41,568
It means...

439
00:34:43,876 --> 00:34:45,811
it means the sun's up.
We need to get moving.

440
00:34:47,346 --> 00:34:48,279
Roslyn.

441
00:35:45,371 --> 00:35:47,931
Looks like your magic rock's
been leading us in circles.

442
00:35:48,374 --> 00:35:50,866
We're gonna starve to death
before we even get there.

443
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:52,908
Hey, I think I found
something up here!

444
00:35:55,748 --> 00:35:57,910
I thought you didn't
believe in Christmas.

445
00:35:58,851 --> 00:36:00,820
At this point I don't know
what to believe.

446
00:36:08,494 --> 00:36:11,623
You need to get your eyes checked.

447
00:36:11,764 --> 00:36:12,823
Why? At least.

448
00:36:14,266 --> 00:36:15,791
Can you smell that?

449
00:36:16,168 --> 00:36:19,900
Fresh baked bread. And bacon!

450
00:36:20,773 --> 00:36:22,332
I'm not going in there.

451
00:36:24,543 --> 00:36:26,569
The crystal says
we go to the tavern.

452
00:36:26,779 --> 00:36:28,077
I agree with Finn.

453
00:36:29,515 --> 00:36:31,746
The compass hasn't
steered us wrong yet.

454
00:36:31,984 --> 00:36:33,213
And I have?

455
00:36:33,352 --> 00:36:34,047
The river.

456
00:36:34,787 --> 00:36:37,689
Wouldn't it be nice to go somewhere
that wasn't crawling with bugs?

457
00:36:37,823 --> 00:36:40,554
I doubt there are any less bugs
in there than there are out here.

458
00:36:40,693 --> 00:36:41,888
But food.

459
00:36:42,695 --> 00:36:45,096
It doesn't look like a very
charitable place, Finn.

460
00:36:45,231 --> 00:36:47,530
How do you imagine
paying for that?

461
00:36:48,534 --> 00:36:49,832
With my good looks.

462
00:37:20,232 --> 00:37:21,860
Get away from here, kids.

463
00:37:32,812 --> 00:37:33,745
What?

464
00:37:33,979 --> 00:37:37,780
We'll have a loaf of your finest bread
and a flagon of water, kind sir.

465
00:37:38,617 --> 00:37:40,449
How do you plan do pay for this?

466
00:37:46,091 --> 00:37:47,616
How about a trade?

467
00:37:54,066 --> 00:37:56,729
Come on, where's
your Christmas spirit?

468
00:37:57,703 --> 00:38:00,104
What, you haven't noticed
my decorations?

469
00:38:04,143 --> 00:38:06,738
That was the last man
that couldn't pay for his meal.

470
00:38:06,912 --> 00:38:07,936
Now scram!

471
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:14,010
It's all right. There's a here.

472
00:38:18,524 --> 00:38:20,686
Excuse me, sir?

473
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:23,695
Would you be so kind as to...

474
00:38:24,864 --> 00:38:25,923
I am so sorry.

475
00:38:26,131 --> 00:38:27,972
She thought you looked
just like our uncle did.

476
00:38:28,133 --> 00:38:29,294
Our mistake.

477
00:38:30,669 --> 00:38:33,229
Thanks,
That was about to get ugly.

478
00:38:33,372 --> 00:38:36,365
You mean uglier.
That guy was only pretty ugly.

479
00:38:36,542 --> 00:38:37,339
Get down!

480
00:38:39,411 --> 00:38:40,606
What are you doing?

481
00:39:01,667 --> 00:39:03,192
I know you.

482
00:39:07,907 --> 00:39:08,931
Go go go!

483
00:39:40,906 --> 00:39:43,375
There. There they are.
Behind those tables!

484
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:48,709
Get out of my way!

485
00:39:48,914 --> 00:39:50,314
Come here. Get over here.

486
00:39:52,051 --> 00:39:54,520
Hey! That's mine, give it back!

487
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:56,384
Where did you get the Waystone?

488
00:39:56,622 --> 00:39:57,555
Waystone?

489
00:39:57,790 --> 00:39:59,224
That's what the old elf called it.

490
00:39:59,325 --> 00:40:02,591
Now you get me out here, kid,
and it's yours.

491
00:40:08,867 --> 00:40:11,302
Move faster, kid, faster.

492
00:40:12,171 --> 00:40:14,231
There. There's a knife.
There's a knife.

493
00:40:14,773 --> 00:40:15,502
Get one.

494
00:40:17,109 --> 00:40:18,475
Come on kids,

495
00:40:19,178 --> 00:40:19,804
let's go.

496
00:40:27,686 --> 00:40:29,120
Don't let them escape.

497
00:40:30,255 --> 00:40:31,416
Out of the way.

498
00:40:31,790 --> 00:40:32,655
Where'd they go?

499
00:40:32,825 --> 00:40:35,294
Where are those cursed brats?
Look over there!

500
00:40:45,504 --> 00:40:46,665
Hey! Give it back!

501
00:40:51,343 --> 00:40:52,402
Give it...

502
00:41:00,252 --> 00:41:01,220
Stop him!

503
00:41:17,736 --> 00:41:19,500
Hey, wait!

504
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:23,873
- I need to talk...
- No, Finn, stop!

505
00:41:24,143 --> 00:41:26,078
Go. Go, go, go.

506
00:41:29,715 --> 00:41:32,446
We need to go!
We need to go now.

507
00:41:33,252 --> 00:41:35,653
Excuse me, excuse me.
Could you help us?

508
00:41:35,821 --> 00:41:36,720
Oh sure, hop in.

509
00:41:54,707 --> 00:41:55,834
Come on!

510
00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:33,611
Let go! Get off!

511
00:42:35,981 --> 00:42:39,110
Wait...

512
00:42:44,857 --> 00:42:46,655
They're catching up!

513
00:42:46,725 --> 00:42:48,057
Go faster!

514
00:42:48,527 --> 00:42:49,654
Help me with this.

515
00:42:54,833 --> 00:42:55,732
Apples!

516
00:42:55,834 --> 00:42:56,665
Pass them up here.

517
00:43:10,182 --> 00:43:11,582
Use your slingshot Fin.

518
00:43:16,221 --> 00:43:17,416
Nice shot Finn.

519
00:43:17,489 --> 00:43:20,789
This is good,
this is good. Right here.

520
00:43:23,595 --> 00:43:25,530
Quick, quick, quick!

521
00:43:28,467 --> 00:43:28,797
What is going on?

522
00:43:28,967 --> 00:43:30,833
Not here, come on.

523
00:43:32,004 --> 00:43:34,030
- Thank you.
- Hup!

524
00:43:38,243 --> 00:43:39,142
Stay with them.

525
00:43:40,312 --> 00:43:42,645
- Faster Let's go!...
- Move quickly.

526
00:43:42,714 --> 00:43:48,813
We can't let them get away.

527
00:43:50,656 --> 00:43:53,182
- We need to keep moving.
- No! I want answers.

528
00:43:53,292 --> 00:43:54,760
All in good time.

529
00:43:56,128 --> 00:43:57,391
From you.

530
00:44:00,766 --> 00:44:03,861
Those two are partly responsible
for my parents' deaths.

531
00:44:05,771 --> 00:44:07,171
Do you know them?

532
00:44:07,806 --> 00:44:08,865
No.

533
00:44:10,676 --> 00:44:13,271
Well I mean, not really.

534
00:44:13,745 --> 00:44:16,408
Do you think Sister Lenora
sent them after us?

535
00:44:16,782 --> 00:44:18,546
What do they want with us?

536
00:44:18,650 --> 00:44:19,948
They're bounty hunters.

537
00:44:20,085 --> 00:44:23,613
Oh. So which one of you got today?

538
00:44:26,825 --> 00:44:27,815
It was me.

539
00:44:29,795 --> 00:44:31,423
What? Spit it out!

540
00:44:32,731 --> 00:44:34,495
When you become of age,

541
00:44:34,733 --> 00:44:36,827
you're old enough to become
an apprentice.

542
00:44:37,569 --> 00:44:40,835
Kids with parents usually
pick with much fair.

543
00:44:41,874 --> 00:44:44,708
Kids like us get sold
to the highest bidder.

544
00:44:47,713 --> 00:44:48,737
Garret.

545
00:44:50,816 --> 00:44:53,047
They must have took him
the morning we left.

546
00:44:53,685 --> 00:44:54,846
That's who was there.

547
00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:57,216
And you must have been
the other one on the list.

548
00:44:58,257 --> 00:44:59,953
I heard them talking about it.

549
00:45:00,459 --> 00:45:02,360
They were gonna send me
to the mines.

550
00:45:02,794 --> 00:45:05,059
I... I couldn't stand going,
I had to run away.

551
00:45:05,264 --> 00:45:08,792
Old enough to know
who's of age and who's not.

552
00:45:08,934 --> 00:45:09,993
Why not?

553
00:45:10,636 --> 00:45:11,194
Well let's put it this way.

554
00:45:11,470 --> 00:45:14,929
If those guys catch up to us, they are
not taking you back to the orphanage.

555
00:45:15,741 --> 00:45:19,701
Roslyn, they've been after
you this whole time.

556
00:45:20,245 --> 00:45:21,406
Not us.

557
00:45:24,149 --> 00:45:25,742
I put you all in danger.

558
00:45:27,185 --> 00:45:28,653
I was afraid.

559
00:45:30,789 --> 00:45:34,191
You should have told us.
We never would have left you.

560
00:45:36,862 --> 00:45:38,194
I'm so sorry.

561
00:45:38,463 --> 00:45:40,796
This is all very sweet.

562
00:45:41,133 --> 00:45:42,934
But there is a pack of
ruthless bounty hunters

563
00:45:43,068 --> 00:45:44,331
who would have caught up
to the wagon by now

564
00:45:44,503 --> 00:45:46,631
and noticed that we are not in it.

565
00:45:46,939 --> 00:45:47,736
So.

566
00:45:48,006 --> 00:45:51,499
Unless you want to be really,
really sorry, we need to go.

567
00:45:51,910 --> 00:45:52,775
Now.

568
00:45:54,513 --> 00:45:55,776
Who are you anyway?

569
00:46:00,085 --> 00:46:01,314
I'm Eric.

570
00:46:08,727 --> 00:46:09,820
Let's go.

571
00:46:10,228 --> 00:46:11,196
- Hoyt.
- Good.

572
00:46:11,396 --> 00:46:11,896
Fin.

573
00:46:12,097 --> 00:46:13,121
- Rand.
- Nice to meet you. Pleasure.

574
00:46:13,332 --> 00:46:15,028
- Rosalynne.
- Thank you.

575
00:46:35,754 --> 00:46:38,383
So an elf gave you his Waystone?

576
00:46:39,825 --> 00:46:41,088
Just like that.

577
00:46:47,766 --> 00:46:49,200
Not exactly.

578
00:46:50,936 --> 00:46:55,738
When he gave it to me,
he... changed.

579
00:46:56,008 --> 00:46:57,476
Changed?

580
00:46:58,343 --> 00:46:59,606
Changed how?

581
00:47:00,345 --> 00:47:02,371
I don't know, it was...

582
00:47:02,981 --> 00:47:05,712
it was like he went dark all
of a sudden.

583
00:47:06,685 --> 00:47:07,948
Like...

584
00:47:08,086 --> 00:47:12,581
Like all of the magic
was being drained out of him.

585
00:47:17,462 --> 00:47:19,328
He turned into a goblin.

586
00:47:22,667 --> 00:47:26,695
He told me to follow
the Waystone, and I did.

587
00:47:28,373 --> 00:47:30,774
And it led me to you.

588
00:47:35,547 --> 00:47:37,539
Do you know where the magic is?

589
00:47:39,451 --> 00:47:40,783
I do.

590
00:47:42,054 --> 00:47:44,023
But it's not that simple.

591
00:47:44,689 --> 00:47:45,782
What do you mean?

592
00:47:50,595 --> 00:47:53,895
Father Christmas's magic
comes from an orb

593
00:47:54,833 --> 00:47:57,701
that's cut from the same crystal
as your Waystone.

594
00:47:58,870 --> 00:48:02,705
I used to have it,
but I lost it years ago.

595
00:48:02,874 --> 00:48:06,174
Lost it? But you just said
you knew where it was.

596
00:48:07,512 --> 00:48:11,415
When I say I lost it,
I meant to someone.

597
00:48:11,783 --> 00:48:16,016
Or, in this case, an ogre.

598
00:48:17,189 --> 00:48:20,626
So without this orb thing there's
no chance of saving Christmas?

599
00:48:21,793 --> 00:48:23,819
Well, I know we should
be rationing this,

600
00:48:24,029 --> 00:48:27,329
but if we're going after an ogre,
I'm gonna need my strength.

601
00:48:36,374 --> 00:48:37,899
I think there's a rock in my shoe.

602
00:48:38,076 --> 00:48:39,874
We have bigger things
to worry about.

603
00:48:40,812 --> 00:48:42,405
Much bigger.

604
00:48:54,025 --> 00:48:56,824
I can't believe you survived
a fight with an ogre.

605
00:48:58,530 --> 00:49:02,661
Well, uh, it wasn't really a fight.

606
00:49:02,734 --> 00:49:04,703
What was it then?
A battle of wits?

607
00:49:04,836 --> 00:49:08,705
Please, tell me you didn't lose
to an ogre in a battle of wits.

608
00:49:08,773 --> 00:49:10,708
Actually it was a bet.

609
00:49:11,209 --> 00:49:14,338
Why in the world would
you make a bet with an ogre?

610
00:49:14,713 --> 00:49:16,682
It's a long story. You see...

611
00:49:21,153 --> 00:49:22,451
I have a plan.

612
00:49:23,188 --> 00:49:24,850
Do you know what ogres
like to eat?

613
00:49:25,290 --> 00:49:27,384
Besides children?

614
00:49:29,261 --> 00:49:30,092
Yes.

615
00:49:35,567 --> 00:49:38,230
We're not going to let
the ogre eat that, right?

616
00:49:38,403 --> 00:49:41,669
No. It's a... distraction.

617
00:49:46,711 --> 00:49:47,940
Quiet down, here he comes.

618
00:50:00,192 --> 00:50:02,787
OK. You ready?

619
00:50:04,029 --> 00:50:05,122
Yeah?

620
00:50:06,131 --> 00:50:08,623
Are you gonna remember the signal?
In case he comes back?

621
00:50:08,967 --> 00:50:10,026
I can do it.

622
00:50:10,468 --> 00:50:11,265
OK.

623
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:29,518
Easy as pie.

624
00:50:30,288 --> 00:50:32,814
I hope that's not what you said
before losing a bet to him.

625
00:50:42,767 --> 00:50:44,793
So what does your stone do?

626
00:50:45,704 --> 00:50:47,764
How's it going to help
bring the magic back?

627
00:50:48,506 --> 00:50:52,910
Well, Father Christmas uses
it to slow down time

628
00:50:53,044 --> 00:50:55,172
so that he can deliver presents.

629
00:50:56,314 --> 00:50:58,579
I mean, how do you think
he did it all in one night?

630
00:50:59,084 --> 00:51:00,814
Will you be able to show us?

631
00:51:01,886 --> 00:51:07,382
Uh... maybe?
There! There, I see it!

632
00:51:24,542 --> 00:51:25,771
Caw!

633
00:51:28,246 --> 00:51:30,215
Was that supposed to be a bird call?

634
00:51:30,382 --> 00:51:31,680
Caw!

635
00:51:31,816 --> 00:51:33,216
This way, this way!

636
00:52:29,741 --> 00:52:30,709
Run!

637
00:52:42,587 --> 00:52:43,782
Hey!

638
00:52:45,056 --> 00:52:46,456
Remember me?

639
00:52:48,893 --> 00:52:49,952
That's nice.

640
00:52:51,696 --> 00:52:53,631
Should we see if they need any help?

641
00:53:21,059 --> 00:53:21,958
Run.

642
00:53:27,532 --> 00:53:29,660
Come on, he won't stay
unconscious forever!

643
00:53:29,834 --> 00:53:32,235
Come on, quickly! Quickly!

644
00:53:34,739 --> 00:53:35,570
Run!

645
00:53:35,707 --> 00:53:36,731
Go!

646
00:53:55,660 --> 00:53:56,787
We made it.

647
00:53:57,729 --> 00:53:58,992
So is that the rock?

648
00:53:59,964 --> 00:54:02,297
Father Christmas uses
it to slow down time.

649
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:04,740
That's how he deliver all
the presents in one night.

650
00:54:05,603 --> 00:54:06,764
Show us how it works.

651
00:54:07,071 --> 00:54:08,562
Yeah, show us!

652
00:54:10,742 --> 00:54:15,203
Well, I... I don't actually know that
I can make it work.

653
00:54:17,449 --> 00:54:18,781
Why? What's missing?

654
00:54:20,084 --> 00:54:24,215
Well I don't actually know that
it works at all anymore.

655
00:54:25,223 --> 00:54:28,057
Ever since I laid hands on it,
it's been dark.

656
00:54:28,726 --> 00:54:30,592
How did you end up with this thing?

657
00:54:31,896 --> 00:54:34,695
That's a long story.
Look, if it's like Ayden says,

658
00:54:34,833 --> 00:54:37,098
and the elves are turning,
then we don't have much time.

659
00:54:38,036 --> 00:54:40,267
OK? We've got two days to
get this to Father Christmas,

660
00:54:40,472 --> 00:54:42,737
and that's our only chance
of making it work again.

661
00:54:43,208 --> 00:54:45,803
All right, how do
we find Father Christmas?

662
00:54:46,945 --> 00:54:48,880
I was afraid you'd ask that.

663
00:54:51,115 --> 00:54:53,175
I could take you to
the border of the North.

664
00:54:53,351 --> 00:54:55,149
But that's as far as I'm going.

665
00:54:56,988 --> 00:54:58,251
All right.

666
00:54:59,023 --> 00:55:00,184
Come on, then.

667
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:23,678
Is that a field over there?

668
00:55:24,782 --> 00:55:26,444
Wouldn't that be easier to travel on?

669
00:55:26,784 --> 00:55:28,548
It'd be quicker, yes.

670
00:55:29,287 --> 00:55:33,281
But being out in the open like that
makes us easy lunch for a dragon.

671
00:55:35,326 --> 00:55:36,692
Besides,

672
00:55:37,829 --> 00:55:40,389
in those woods are hunter-bandits.

673
00:55:40,865 --> 00:55:44,734
You think that these woods
are infested with goblins.

674
00:55:44,936 --> 00:55:47,064
Are there?
Goblins in these woods?

675
00:55:47,171 --> 00:55:48,696
In these woods?

676
00:55:51,609 --> 00:55:57,310
No. No, the scariest things
in these woods is us.

677
00:56:00,752 --> 00:56:02,812
He doesn't seem very sure of himself.

678
00:56:15,833 --> 00:56:16,801
They're close.

679
00:56:41,259 --> 00:56:42,158
So.

680
00:56:43,528 --> 00:56:45,656
How do you feel about using
rivers to travel?

681
00:56:45,730 --> 00:56:47,665
It's a good way to hide
your tracks, right?

682
00:56:48,666 --> 00:56:50,100
It seems like it could work.

683
00:56:51,502 --> 00:56:55,132
But there's a lot of foul beasts lurking in
that water who wouldn't think twice

684
00:56:55,306 --> 00:56:58,299
about tearing you into chum.

685
00:57:01,846 --> 00:57:04,008
Ow. Ouch.

686
00:57:04,415 --> 00:57:05,314
What is it?

687
00:57:20,365 --> 00:57:24,200
Ready, aim, fire!

688
00:57:26,938 --> 00:57:28,065
Wait!

689
00:57:32,010 --> 00:57:33,808
Finn! Roslyn! Slow down!

690
00:57:37,749 --> 00:57:40,218
Grant! Wait, what are you...

691
00:57:47,191 --> 00:57:48,819
Finn, wait, where are you going?

692
00:58:01,806 --> 00:58:04,640
They shot this little one down too.

693
00:58:07,745 --> 00:58:08,735
No, don't!

694
00:58:18,222 --> 00:58:19,884
Ayden, it's hurt.

695
00:58:20,458 --> 00:58:22,893
She's an orphan like us now.

696
00:58:23,728 --> 00:58:26,197
If we don't help her, no one will.

697
00:58:35,473 --> 00:58:37,374
This is a bad idea.

698
00:58:43,147 --> 00:58:45,981
We really should be going,
there is nothing we can do.

699
00:59:19,851 --> 00:59:23,913
Those bandits will be here any minute
to make sure that that dragon is dead.

700
00:59:25,389 --> 00:59:28,291
But aren't the bandits too scared
to come into the woods?

701
00:59:28,693 --> 00:59:30,252
What about the goblins?

702
00:59:30,495 --> 00:59:33,329
Yeah, the only problem
is there are no goblins.

703
00:59:40,138 --> 00:59:41,663
Yes. There are.

704
00:59:50,248 --> 00:59:52,547
I think the beast went
down by the river.

705
01:00:09,867 --> 01:00:10,926
Did you see that?

706
01:00:17,775 --> 01:00:19,334
Don't be a coward.

707
01:00:20,378 --> 01:00:21,311
This way.

708
01:01:10,461 --> 01:01:13,397
Hey! You're no goblin.

709
01:01:48,499 --> 01:01:51,697
Hey! You! Get over here!

710
01:02:04,215 --> 01:02:06,741
Don't worry.
They'll be back soon.

711
01:02:11,389 --> 01:02:12,823
I'll go see what it is.

712
01:02:20,865 --> 01:02:23,528
Isn't that sweet.

713
01:02:23,834 --> 01:02:25,496
A girl and her dragon.

714
01:02:25,937 --> 01:02:28,736
Step aside. This one's mine.

715
01:02:30,875 --> 01:02:34,277
I shot it down. It's mine to kill.

716
01:02:36,747 --> 01:02:38,875
Then you'll have to go
through me first.

717
01:03:36,807 --> 01:03:39,470
Our woods, our dragon.

718
01:03:45,149 --> 01:03:46,742
Are you a goblin?

719
01:03:47,985 --> 01:03:49,214
Who are you?

720
01:03:50,488 --> 01:03:52,548
I was going to ask
you the same thing.

721
01:03:55,793 --> 01:03:58,490
What are you waiting for?
Get out of here!

722
01:04:06,804 --> 01:04:09,137
Well it looks like you didn't have
any problems here.

723
01:04:09,306 --> 01:04:12,674
Well I did run into a little trouble,
but I was able to take care of it.

724
01:04:12,977 --> 01:04:13,808
With help.

725
01:04:14,945 --> 01:04:16,504
Found you the herbs you needed.

726
01:04:17,181 --> 01:04:18,012
Saerwen?

727
01:04:18,249 --> 01:04:19,376
Oh! Uh!

728
01:04:21,952 --> 01:04:23,215
That's for leaving.

729
01:04:23,821 --> 01:04:25,722
- And that is for not saying goodbye.
- OK.

730
01:04:25,823 --> 01:04:29,817
And that is for stealing
the orb of Borealis.

731
01:04:30,995 --> 01:04:33,294
Are you gonna beat the rest of us up, too?

732
01:04:33,964 --> 01:04:34,795
No.

733
01:04:35,833 --> 01:04:37,802
I only do that to thieves.

734
01:04:39,537 --> 01:04:42,701
Ayden, do you care
to explain what's going on?

735
01:04:43,140 --> 01:04:44,540
Who's your new friend?

736
01:04:44,809 --> 01:04:45,902
This is Saerwen.

737
01:04:46,010 --> 01:04:48,980
She's one of the elves from the north
trying to find the orb of Borealis,

738
01:04:49,146 --> 01:04:51,672
which apparently was stolen
from Father Christmas.

739
01:04:52,183 --> 01:04:53,378
By his son.

740
01:04:56,454 --> 01:04:57,945
Isn't that right, Eric?

741
01:04:58,089 --> 01:04:59,557
I didn't do it for me.

742
01:04:59,857 --> 01:05:01,416
Well it was still pretty selfish.

743
01:05:01,892 --> 01:05:04,088
You have no idea what's happening
in the north, do you?

744
01:05:04,261 --> 01:05:06,127
Well I can see that it's not good.

745
01:05:06,297 --> 01:05:07,731
Well this is the least of it.

746
01:05:08,232 --> 01:05:09,632
The north is dying.

747
01:05:10,034 --> 01:05:13,527
The Snall is back and it is huge
and dark and dangerous and wrong.

748
01:05:13,737 --> 01:05:18,038
And Father Christmas
your father is not doing well.

749
01:05:19,810 --> 01:05:20,675
Hold on.

750
01:05:21,178 --> 01:05:23,977
I thought this orb thing was
for delivering presents.

751
01:05:24,115 --> 01:05:26,311
Now all of a sudden
it's destroying the north?

752
01:05:26,484 --> 01:05:32,424
Yeah, I... I may not have been
completely honest about its powers.

753
01:05:32,823 --> 01:05:34,689
Well that is the understatement
of the century.

754
01:05:35,292 --> 01:05:37,488
When connected
to Father Christmas's staff,

755
01:05:37,661 --> 01:05:40,324
the orb makes time in
the north run constantly slower.

756
01:05:40,498 --> 01:05:43,730
It has to for the north to function.

757
01:05:44,034 --> 01:05:46,435
Is that why Father Christmas
has lived for so long?

758
01:05:46,537 --> 01:05:47,470
Yes.

759
01:05:48,139 --> 01:05:50,370
And it also helps us keep
the Snall at bay.

760
01:05:50,774 --> 01:05:54,768
With the power to control time,
it can pretty much do anything.

761
01:05:54,945 --> 01:05:56,470
No, it can't.

762
01:05:58,549 --> 01:05:59,539
Eric.

763
01:05:59,984 --> 01:06:04,752
You know that the orb can slow down time
and sometimes even stop it at nothing.

764
01:06:04,989 --> 01:06:06,457
Not even the orb can reverse it.

765
01:06:06,590 --> 01:06:08,650
Yeah, but he didn't even try.

766
01:06:08,826 --> 01:06:11,295
Someone had to try.

767
01:06:13,430 --> 01:06:14,489
For her.

768
01:06:15,232 --> 01:06:16,063
Who?

769
01:06:20,004 --> 01:06:21,495
Eric's mother died.

770
01:06:22,173 --> 01:06:23,539
Five years ago.

771
01:06:24,775 --> 01:06:27,745
He stole the orb to
turn back time and save her.

772
01:06:32,550 --> 01:06:33,518
Look.

773
01:06:38,255 --> 01:06:42,852
You know that I never
meant for any of this to happen.

774
01:06:44,929 --> 01:06:47,262
I would never do
anything to hurt you.

775
01:06:48,699 --> 01:06:50,793
Don't ever leave without
saying goodbye again.

776
01:06:53,137 --> 01:06:54,730
Glad you came back.

777
01:06:55,306 --> 01:06:56,672
But there isn't much time.

778
01:06:57,474 --> 01:06:59,807
Even now it may be too late
to save Christmas.

779
01:07:03,514 --> 01:07:04,709
We've failed.

780
01:07:09,153 --> 01:07:10,746
There's still a chance, Ayden.

781
01:07:11,455 --> 01:07:14,152
But we must return the
orb back to Father Christmas.

782
01:07:17,828 --> 01:07:19,797
I was afraid you'd say that.

783
01:07:39,783 --> 01:07:43,720
I know it hurts, but this will help
your wing heal faster.

784
01:07:45,856 --> 01:07:47,552
What are we going to do with her?

785
01:07:48,692 --> 01:07:49,887
We're keeping her.

786
01:07:52,429 --> 01:07:55,524
She's not gonna be able to travel
very far until her wings heal.

787
01:07:55,666 --> 01:07:56,690
We can't wait.

788
01:07:57,368 --> 01:07:58,802
Tomorrow is Christmas eve.

789
01:07:58,936 --> 01:08:00,666
We can take her with us.

790
01:08:01,572 --> 01:08:04,132
Dragons are meant to fly,
not walk.

791
01:08:04,575 --> 01:08:06,339
She would never make it
in the snow.

792
01:08:07,044 --> 01:08:10,071
What is so bad about
this Snall thing?

793
01:08:10,214 --> 01:08:11,944
You'll find out soon enough.

794
01:08:12,716 --> 01:08:15,413
I don't like the sound of that at all.

795
01:08:16,420 --> 01:08:17,820
We should get some sleep.

796
01:08:19,156 --> 01:08:20,818
We're going to need our rest.

797
01:08:38,809 --> 01:08:40,471
You'll be safe here.

798
01:08:40,811 --> 01:08:42,812
You have plenty of food and water.

799
01:08:42,813 --> 01:08:44,372
Stay off that wing.

800
01:08:45,616 --> 01:08:47,608
Even though it's healing fast,
no flying.

801
01:08:47,751 --> 01:08:48,980
You need your rest.

802
01:08:52,489 --> 01:08:53,479
Don't worry.

803
01:08:54,325 --> 01:08:56,453
You've created a sacred
bond with her.

804
01:08:56,794 --> 01:08:59,286
And you will always
be able to find.

805
01:09:04,234 --> 01:09:05,497
All set to go?

806
01:09:09,740 --> 01:09:13,336
We're going north. Catch up
with us when you can.

807
01:10:55,846 --> 01:10:57,678
I don't remember it being quite so...

808
01:10:57,781 --> 01:10:58,339
Dark?

809
01:10:58,649 --> 01:10:59,514
Creepy?

810
01:10:59,750 --> 01:11:01,651
Terrifying beyond all belief?

811
01:11:01,852 --> 01:11:03,650
I was going to say big, but.

812
01:11:05,022 --> 01:11:06,684
I told you it was bad.

813
01:11:07,458 --> 01:11:09,256
And all this in a few years.

814
01:11:09,493 --> 01:11:11,359
It's gotten worse as time goes on.

815
01:11:11,795 --> 01:11:15,664
With no elves left to cut it back,
it's gone dark and wild.

816
01:11:21,738 --> 01:11:24,469
Are you sure it's a good idea
for you to go in there?

817
01:11:24,975 --> 01:11:27,308
Going through the only
way to the north now.

818
01:11:27,711 --> 01:11:29,407
We have no other choice.

819
01:11:55,572 --> 01:11:57,438
Do you have the feeling
we're being watched?

820
01:11:58,876 --> 01:12:02,677
This way.
There is something back there.

821
01:12:03,046 --> 01:12:04,275
Goblins.

822
01:12:05,115 --> 01:12:07,584
They're gathering,
closing in on us.

823
01:12:07,751 --> 01:12:09,720
I've never met a full-blown
goblin before,

824
01:12:09,853 --> 01:12:14,257
but deep down they're
still elves. Right?

825
01:12:15,292 --> 01:12:17,090
The Snall makes us
forget who we are.

826
01:12:17,628 --> 01:12:19,824
I feel it pulling on me.

827
01:12:21,832 --> 01:12:23,232
So what do we do?

828
01:12:24,301 --> 01:12:25,826
We need to stay together.

829
01:12:31,975 --> 01:12:32,965
What do we do?

830
01:12:34,745 --> 01:12:35,678
Run!

831
01:12:36,780 --> 01:12:38,544
OK follow the twins,
I'll take Finn!

832
01:12:38,715 --> 01:12:40,675
- What about the girls?
- They'll be fine, now go!

833
01:12:56,700 --> 01:12:58,692
Hey! Oh!

834
01:12:59,803 --> 01:13:01,135
A little help here?

835
01:13:10,814 --> 01:13:11,782
Take this!

836
01:13:12,749 --> 01:13:13,773
Finn!

837
01:13:14,751 --> 01:13:15,741
Finn!

838
01:13:17,588 --> 01:13:18,556
Finn!

839
01:13:20,057 --> 01:13:21,081
Behind you!

840
01:13:25,896 --> 01:13:26,920
Roslyn!

841
01:13:27,564 --> 01:13:28,725
Let go of my friend!

842
01:13:34,404 --> 01:13:35,428
Go, go!

843
01:13:40,811 --> 01:13:42,677
Hurry! Quickly!

844
01:13:47,417 --> 01:13:50,387
Go! Go!

845
01:14:03,433 --> 01:14:04,696
Get down!

846
01:14:11,908 --> 01:14:12,705
Let's go!

847
01:14:16,780 --> 01:14:18,408
I've got you.

848
01:14:25,789 --> 01:14:27,724
- What's wrong with...
- Not sure.

849
01:14:27,791 --> 01:14:28,690
Saerwen?

850
01:14:29,292 --> 01:14:32,956
It's this place.
Eric? Get me out of here.

851
01:15:27,284 --> 01:15:27,614
Eric.

852
01:15:27,784 --> 01:15:30,720
Look. You have to fight,
you have to fight it.

853
01:15:31,421 --> 01:15:33,856
I can't. I'm out of time.

854
01:16:06,656 --> 01:16:08,818
And I thought you needed me.

855
01:16:12,062 --> 01:16:13,257
We need you.

856
01:16:18,668 --> 01:16:20,159
No, don't leave me.

857
01:16:21,104 --> 01:16:24,973
Don't leave me,
we need you! I need you.

858
01:16:26,109 --> 01:16:27,475
I need you.

859
01:16:32,549 --> 01:16:33,608
Please.

860
01:16:35,051 --> 01:16:36,451
Please.

861
01:16:59,609 --> 01:17:02,477
You did it. You used the orb.

862
01:17:11,221 --> 01:17:12,985
Disgusting.

863
01:17:19,062 --> 01:17:20,530
There's hope yet.

864
01:17:21,531 --> 01:17:24,194
If we can get the orb back
to Father Christmas in time.

865
01:17:24,734 --> 01:17:27,898
But the sun is already setting.
It's Christmas Eve.

866
01:17:34,377 --> 01:17:35,743
Wow.

867
01:17:38,815 --> 01:17:42,252
I see the end of the Snarl!
Follow us!

868
01:17:44,988 --> 01:17:46,752
What are we waiting for?

869
01:17:56,867 --> 01:17:58,301
Thank you!

870
01:18:11,815 --> 01:18:15,513
This is
where Father Christmas lives?

871
01:18:16,152 --> 01:18:18,144
It didn't always look like this.

872
01:18:22,459 --> 01:18:23,620
Are you ready?

873
01:18:37,107 --> 01:18:38,632
I just want to warn you.

874
01:18:39,209 --> 01:18:41,178
You're not going
to like what you see.

875
01:19:58,755 --> 01:19:59,745
Father?

876
01:20:09,766 --> 01:20:10,893
Father.

877
01:20:14,771 --> 01:20:18,503
He's still alive, he's just... old?

878
01:20:21,644 --> 01:20:24,546
It was only the magic of the orb
that kept his body young.

879
01:20:24,814 --> 01:20:28,410
Without it, he's just
a thousand-year-old man.

880
01:20:40,697 --> 01:20:41,824
Father.

881
01:20:43,466 --> 01:20:45,492
I've brought back the orb.

882
01:20:47,270 --> 01:20:49,739
You can save Christmas.

883
01:20:56,413 --> 01:20:57,574
Come on, children.

884
01:20:58,581 --> 01:21:00,140
Let's give them some time alone.

885
01:21:15,532 --> 01:21:19,628
Father, I know how
angry you must be.

886
01:21:21,004 --> 01:21:26,875
Yet I know that there is nothing
I can say to fix the damage I have done.

887
01:21:31,314 --> 01:21:33,408
But I am sorry.

888
01:22:15,258 --> 01:22:16,692
Here's our last hope.

889
01:22:22,832 --> 01:22:25,825
At least I get to spend
my last Christmas with you.

890
01:22:29,873 --> 01:22:32,308
I can't believe we came all
this way for nothing!

891
01:22:32,709 --> 01:22:34,200
We can't just give up.

892
01:22:36,746 --> 01:22:38,339
There's nothing else to do.

893
01:22:39,849 --> 01:22:41,408
And it's all my fault.

894
01:22:41,985 --> 01:22:43,920
Christmas is lost forever.

895
01:22:44,154 --> 01:22:45,747
No, it can't be lost!

896
01:22:45,889 --> 01:22:48,222
If we give up, then it really is lost.

897
01:22:50,260 --> 01:22:52,957
But we already know that
the magic... it's not completely gone.

898
01:22:53,096 --> 01:22:54,655
Maybe not yet,

899
01:22:54,864 --> 01:22:58,096
but without a whole lot of magic,
Father Christmas won't ever wake up.

900
01:22:59,569 --> 01:23:02,767
Our... our Christmas wishes!
Rand, Hoyt!

901
01:23:03,072 --> 01:23:04,665
We got our dragon.

902
01:23:05,542 --> 01:23:06,737
I never told you,

903
01:23:07,710 --> 01:23:11,112
but my wish was to be free from the life
that would have been forced onto me.

904
01:23:12,782 --> 01:23:14,614
And I guess that came true, too.

905
01:23:15,885 --> 01:23:18,821
I can't imagine those goons
finding me all the way up here.

906
01:23:20,156 --> 01:23:23,092
And I guess my wish
came true a long time ago.

907
01:23:23,593 --> 01:23:24,788
What was that?

908
01:23:25,495 --> 01:23:26,485
A family.

909
01:23:31,534 --> 01:23:32,661
I don't know.

910
01:23:33,736 --> 01:23:36,638
I mean even with all
those wishes look.

911
01:23:37,540 --> 01:23:39,304
My father hasn't stirred.

912
01:23:40,176 --> 01:23:41,337
Not yet.

913
01:23:42,545 --> 01:23:44,377
But they're right about the wishes.

914
01:23:44,581 --> 01:23:46,482
Who knows how many it will take.

915
01:23:47,150 --> 01:23:49,779
But look how powerful mine
was in the Snarl.

916
01:23:51,688 --> 01:23:54,180
When did your wish come true
in the Snarl?

917
01:23:54,857 --> 01:23:56,849
When you said you needed me.

918
01:24:03,299 --> 01:24:04,699
All right, Ayden.

919
01:24:05,134 --> 01:24:06,261
I believe.

920
01:24:07,804 --> 01:24:09,363
What's the plan?

921
01:24:14,544 --> 01:24:16,740
Eric! Get the list from your father.

922
01:24:16,846 --> 01:24:19,406
Rand, Hoyt, Finn, go help
Saerwen get the presents.

923
01:24:19,582 --> 01:24:21,175
Roslyn, you're with me.

924
01:25:11,868 --> 01:25:15,168
But, wait. How are we gonna pull
the sleigh without magic?

925
01:25:19,609 --> 01:25:21,305
Are you sure this thing
is gonna work?

926
01:25:21,577 --> 01:25:26,140
No, but it's not impossible
to imagine that it might.

927
01:25:26,749 --> 01:25:29,150
That's everything.
It's now or never.

928
01:25:29,686 --> 01:25:32,918
All right, dragon.
On the count of three.

929
01:25:33,589 --> 01:25:34,352
One.

930
01:25:35,825 --> 01:25:36,815
Two.

931
01:25:37,727 --> 01:25:38,751
Three!

932
01:25:43,366 --> 01:25:44,664
It's all right!

933
01:25:45,535 --> 01:25:46,730
You can go.

934
01:26:11,394 --> 01:26:12,555
Fire!

935
01:26:16,165 --> 01:26:17,690
Is everybody all right?

936
01:26:19,102 --> 01:26:20,035
Roslyn!

937
01:26:22,805 --> 01:26:23,829
The presents!

938
01:26:24,774 --> 01:26:26,743
Tell her we need to go higher!

939
01:26:26,809 --> 01:26:29,404
Higher! We need to go higher!

940
01:26:47,263 --> 01:26:48,731
Merry Christmas to you, too!

941
01:27:24,934 --> 01:27:26,402
Once all the presents are delivered,

942
01:27:26,536 --> 01:27:29,233
we'll ring the town bell and everyone
will be able to wake up to their gifts.

943
01:27:29,338 --> 01:27:30,863
With that many Christmas
wishes coming true,

944
01:27:31,007 --> 01:27:33,101
there'll be enough magic
to save Christmas for good.

945
01:27:34,710 --> 01:27:36,508
- Eveline and Violet Ashwater.
- OK.

946
01:27:37,246 --> 01:27:38,214
Larson Pike.

947
01:27:39,382 --> 01:27:41,010
Pansy and Penny Brooks.

948
01:27:52,028 --> 01:27:53,792
Christian Andrews.

949
01:27:55,031 --> 01:27:56,192
Amora Brielle.

950
01:29:23,953 --> 01:29:25,717
Who is out of bed?

951
01:29:27,790 --> 01:29:30,191
Hoyt? Rand?

952
01:29:30,860 --> 01:29:33,828
Oh, where have you been?
I have been worried sick.

953
01:29:33,829 --> 01:29:36,663
- We went to the north.
- To find Father Christmas.

954
01:29:37,867 --> 01:29:39,733
There is no Father Christmas.

955
01:29:43,172 --> 01:29:46,233
- This is yours.
- This one's for you.

956
01:29:52,181 --> 01:29:54,309
I've always wanted one.

957
01:29:55,484 --> 01:29:57,043
H... how did you know?

958
01:29:57,219 --> 01:30:00,451
It's not from us. It's from him.

959
01:30:02,224 --> 01:30:05,388
This is just like
the one my mother had.

960
01:30:17,807 --> 01:30:19,469
All the gifts have been delivered.

961
01:30:19,609 --> 01:30:22,272
It's up to Ayden and the
twins now. To ring the bell.

962
01:30:22,712 --> 01:30:24,271
I'll go see what's keeping her.

963
01:30:38,628 --> 01:30:39,687
We need to hurry.

964
01:30:39,795 --> 01:30:42,629
- There it is, get the dragon!
- Come on!

965
01:30:42,765 --> 01:30:43,425
What is it?

966
01:30:43,633 --> 01:30:45,693
The dragon!
I... I have to go help him.

967
01:30:45,768 --> 01:30:47,100
You two go on without me.

968
01:30:56,979 --> 01:30:58,277
Rand?

969
01:31:00,750 --> 01:31:01,945
Rand?

970
01:31:07,923 --> 01:31:09,152
Ayden?

971
01:31:13,129 --> 01:31:14,427
Rand? Hoyt?

972
01:31:19,735 --> 01:31:21,431
Where's their Christmas spirit?

973
01:31:21,570 --> 01:31:25,701
Well, angry mobs aren't exactly
known for their good will.

974
01:31:30,713 --> 01:31:31,737
Step aside.

975
01:31:32,348 --> 01:31:33,976
You're gonna have to kill us first.

976
01:31:34,250 --> 01:31:36,116
Yeah, what he said.

977
01:31:36,485 --> 01:31:39,512
- So be it.
- No! Stop!

978
01:31:40,156 --> 01:31:43,149
Out of the way, girl.
This dragon is made for us to kill.

979
01:31:43,325 --> 01:31:46,887
There's no need for violence.
It's Christmas.

980
01:31:47,129 --> 01:31:49,621
Christmas or not, that's a dragon.

981
01:31:49,699 --> 01:31:50,792
- Yeah!
- Yeah.

982
01:31:51,067 --> 01:31:53,730
I know all too well about
the danger of dragons.

983
01:31:54,270 --> 01:31:56,637
It was a dragon that took
my parents from me.

984
01:31:57,673 --> 01:31:59,904
But I was able to look past my fear.

985
01:32:00,543 --> 01:32:02,671
If we don't hurt them,
they won't hurt us.

986
01:32:04,447 --> 01:32:08,509
It's just a young dragon.
It's an orphan. Like me.

987
01:32:12,288 --> 01:32:13,722
Rand? Hoyt?

988
01:32:25,267 --> 01:32:26,326
Thank you.

989
01:32:26,769 --> 01:32:27,862
Ring the bell!

990
01:32:33,809 --> 01:32:36,108
Well, well, well.

991
01:32:36,545 --> 01:32:39,674
Looks like our Christmas
wish came true.

992
01:32:40,149 --> 01:32:44,416
Are you going to come along quietly,
or do you need persuading?

993
01:32:49,792 --> 01:32:53,229
It's a young dragon now.
But the dragons grow up.

994
01:32:53,395 --> 01:32:55,697
- Yeah!
- And then what? I Yeah.

995
01:32:55,698 --> 01:33:00,864
Christmas is about forgiving,
and understanding.

996
01:33:01,470 --> 01:33:05,305
It reminds us to think of others
instead of ourselves.

997
01:33:05,508 --> 01:33:08,706
This dragon saved our lives,

998
01:33:09,311 --> 01:33:11,109
and it helped us deliver Christmas.

999
01:33:11,347 --> 01:33:14,579
What Christmas?
There is no Christmas anymore!

1000
01:33:14,817 --> 01:33:15,807
Yeah!

1001
01:33:19,221 --> 01:33:20,712
You have to let her go.

1002
01:33:21,490 --> 01:33:23,220
If someone doesn't ring that bell,

1003
01:33:23,325 --> 01:33:25,885
there will never be another
Christmas ever again.

1004
01:33:26,328 --> 01:33:30,629
Christmas.
That's just a story for kids.

1005
01:33:30,933 --> 01:33:34,700
Roslyn's too old to believe in
that nonsense, isn't that right?

1006
01:33:35,137 --> 01:33:38,767
If I let her go she'd just
run away to save herself.

1007
01:33:41,410 --> 01:33:43,140
Let us go and you'll find out.

1008
01:33:59,228 --> 01:34:01,697
You're going to need
two hands to ring that bell.

1009
01:34:02,331 --> 01:34:06,996
So what'll it be?
Save yourself or save Christmas.

1010
01:34:07,136 --> 01:34:10,436
Roslyn. You have to believe.

1011
01:34:13,909 --> 01:34:18,404
Just ring the bell and you're mine.

1012
01:34:30,659 --> 01:34:31,683
Let her go!

1013
01:35:20,876 --> 01:35:22,469
Grandfather,

1014
01:35:22,945 --> 01:35:25,710
Grandfather, look! For Christmas!

1015
01:35:39,495 --> 01:35:40,554
We did it.

1016
01:35:40,829 --> 01:35:42,855
This might actually work.

1017
01:35:46,235 --> 01:35:48,136
There's the rest of them.

1018
01:35:51,006 --> 01:35:52,702
Let go of them now.

1019
01:35:53,776 --> 01:35:56,746
My, oh my.
This little one has spirit.

1020
01:35:56,845 --> 01:35:57,869
You.

1021
01:35:58,914 --> 01:36:01,713
You're the reason
my mother and father are dead.

1022
01:36:01,951 --> 01:36:04,216
It's because of you that
I'm an orphan.

1023
01:36:06,422 --> 01:36:11,451
Yes. I remember.
You cost me a lot that day.

1024
01:36:11,527 --> 01:36:14,395
I lost some good men
and a good wagon.

1025
01:36:14,530 --> 01:36:18,797
- Time to repay me for all the troub...
- She is not going anywhere.

1026
01:36:19,068 --> 01:36:20,798
If you try to to take her,

1027
01:36:21,070 --> 01:36:23,699
that dragon will burn you
to the ground.

1028
01:36:26,875 --> 01:36:29,538
Well that can't happen, can it?

1029
01:36:29,712 --> 01:36:32,739
A good dragon is a dead dragon.

1030
01:36:55,738 --> 01:36:59,300
- Oh, dear me! Father Christmas?
- Can it really be him?

1031
01:36:59,475 --> 01:37:00,841
Father Christmas?

1032
01:37:01,777 --> 01:37:03,109
Gazared.

1033
01:37:03,712 --> 01:37:04,941
Born tall.

1034
01:37:05,814 --> 01:37:09,410
Untie those children
and release them to me.

1035
01:37:09,685 --> 01:37:10,584
Listen, old man.

1036
01:37:10,753 --> 01:37:14,849
We've paid for the girl and we're
already several days past her delivery.

1037
01:37:15,591 --> 01:37:17,492
The rest we're taking for our trouble.

1038
01:37:17,659 --> 01:37:22,097
The only thing you'll be getting,
Gazared, grim grace's justice.

1039
01:37:22,464 --> 01:37:24,933
And you barely deserve that much.

1040
01:37:25,467 --> 01:37:28,164
For your treachery, your thievery,

1041
01:37:28,270 --> 01:37:34,232
your dishonesty, and, most despicably,
your attack on these children,

1042
01:37:34,777 --> 01:37:37,779
I find you guilty,
and sentence you...

1043
01:37:37,780 --> 01:37:41,239
To what?
What are you going to do?

1044
01:37:41,817 --> 01:37:44,343
You are both banished.

1045
01:37:45,154 --> 01:37:51,492
Leave this land and never,
ever, ever return.

1046
01:37:51,693 --> 01:37:53,025
And if we do?

1047
01:37:53,295 --> 01:37:54,854
You'll have to deal with us.

1048
01:37:55,731 --> 01:37:57,063
All of us.

1049
01:37:57,166 --> 01:37:58,657
Yeah!...

1050
01:38:20,089 --> 01:38:23,389
Father. Father,
I know how angry you must be.

1051
01:38:23,459 --> 01:38:27,396
Here. It's all right.
All is forgiven.

1052
01:38:34,436 --> 01:38:38,339
Thank you for finding my son.
And bringing him home.

1053
01:38:38,707 --> 01:38:40,300
It wasn't me who found him.

1054
01:38:41,176 --> 01:38:42,735
It was these children.

1055
01:38:44,780 --> 01:38:51,186
Rand, Hoyt, Roslyn, Finn,
Ayden. My sincerest thanks.

1056
01:38:51,553 --> 01:38:54,148
I will not forget
what you've done for me.

1057
01:38:55,124 --> 01:38:56,786
Saerwen, Eric.

1058
01:38:57,059 --> 01:38:59,961
Make sure Gazared
and Born tall have left for good.

1059
01:39:00,295 --> 01:39:02,855
I'll see to it that these
children get back home.

1060
01:39:11,673 --> 01:39:13,369
What's wrong, child?

1061
01:39:13,976 --> 01:39:15,569
Don't you want to go?

1062
01:39:16,245 --> 01:39:17,804
I just thought after all this,

1063
01:39:17,980 --> 01:39:20,415
we wouldn't have to go back
to the orphanage.

1064
01:39:20,949 --> 01:39:22,645
That's not your home anymore.

1065
01:39:23,986 --> 01:39:26,717
Your home is with me now.

1066
01:39:27,689 --> 01:39:29,658
For as long as you want.

1067
01:39:29,858 --> 01:39:31,793
And that goes for
the rest of you, too.

1068
01:39:32,394 --> 01:39:35,796
I'm sure we can find five beds
for the rest of you to sleep in.

1069
01:39:49,745 --> 01:39:51,145
Father Christmas?

1070
01:39:52,247 --> 01:39:54,182
Can I have one more
Christmas wish?

1071
01:39:54,616 --> 01:39:58,712
Yes, we can pick up
Garret along the way.

1072
01:40:09,298 --> 01:40:10,322
There they are!

1073
01:40:12,467 --> 01:40:14,028
Don't hurt them,
just give them a scare.

1074
01:40:14,136 --> 01:40:15,900
Hold on!

1075
01:41:03,685 --> 01:41:04,653
Family

1076
01:41:05,187 --> 01:41:07,713
is what's most important in life.

1077
01:41:09,725 --> 01:41:12,354
Be it formed of blood or of bond.

1078
01:41:13,228 --> 01:41:15,390
When someone joins a family,

1079
01:41:15,464 --> 01:41:17,933
they are bound together forever.

1080
01:41:18,734 --> 01:41:20,100
They come to our rescue

1081
01:41:20,769 --> 01:41:22,670
when we need it the most.

1082
01:41:24,773 --> 01:41:25,968
With family,

1083
01:41:27,075 --> 01:41:29,704
we have our saddest moments,

1084
01:41:31,213 --> 01:41:34,115
but also our happiest.

1085
01:41:36,351 --> 01:41:40,118
Family is one
of God's greatest gifts to us.

1086
01:41:40,756 --> 01:41:42,486
We must honor it,

1087
01:41:42,824 --> 01:41:45,055
with all our heart,
throughout our life.

1088
01:41:47,629 --> 01:41:50,064
And so, Saerwen,

1089
01:41:52,034 --> 01:41:53,502
with great joy,

1090
01:41:53,669 --> 01:41:55,831
you are hereby joined

1091
01:41:55,937 --> 01:41:57,906
with our family.

1092
01:42:02,577 --> 01:42:05,809
Don't just stand there, boy.
Kiss the girl.
