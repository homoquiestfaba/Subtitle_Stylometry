00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:52,183
Yo, you finished
taking your piss?

3
00:02:54,385 --> 00:02:55,853
Could use some help over here.

4
00:03:03,361 --> 00:03:04,794
How many barrels of this crap

5
00:03:04,796 --> 00:03:06,898
did they have us dump
here last summer?

6
00:03:08,266 --> 00:03:11,200
Enough for us
to pays the bills,

7
00:03:11,202 --> 00:03:14,373
so we do what we do, right?

8
00:03:16,641 --> 00:03:17,942
Where we moving 'em to?

9
00:03:19,109 --> 00:03:22,378
About three
miles down the freeway.

10
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:25,780
There's an old abandoned
park down there off the 15.

11
00:03:25,782 --> 00:03:27,285
Story Book Land!

12
00:03:28,286 --> 00:03:31,621
I used to love that place!

13
00:03:31,623 --> 00:03:35,491
My dad had these home movies
of my younger brother and me

14
00:03:35,493 --> 00:03:37,395
on the little firetrucks.

15
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:40,296
So cool.

16
00:03:40,298 --> 00:03:41,433
This bitch is stuck.

17
00:03:45,602 --> 00:03:50,573
Told those goombas from the
city this is where we part ways.

18
00:03:50,575 --> 00:03:54,177
After this gig is finished,
we're done with 'em.

19
00:03:54,179 --> 00:03:57,115
We shoulda be done with
them a long time ago.

20
00:03:58,517 --> 00:04:03,020
We get caught, no money's
enough to save us from the feds.

21
00:04:05,256 --> 00:04:07,689
Let's just open a weed shop.

22
00:04:07,691 --> 00:04:10,028
No thanks.

23
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:14,866
How about a vintage VHS
store like the '80s?

24
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,972
You mean like VCR VHS?

25
00:04:27,611 --> 00:04:28,713
Be kind.

26
00:04:30,113 --> 00:04:31,115
Rewind.

27
00:04:33,817 --> 00:04:38,320
That's right, mock the VCR!

28
00:04:38,322 --> 00:04:41,390
Back when you could tell
what kind of person you were

29
00:04:41,392 --> 00:04:44,060
by what kind of
movies you rented.

30
00:04:44,062 --> 00:04:47,999
You were either a top-loader
or a front-loader.

31
00:04:50,067 --> 00:04:52,236
What the hell are
you babbling about?

32
00:04:54,072 --> 00:04:55,807
This is one tough SOB.

33
00:05:12,055 --> 00:05:12,890
Here.

34
00:05:13,925 --> 00:05:15,026
Try this.

35
00:05:16,894 --> 00:05:21,198
Wedge it under the
bottom and rock it.

36
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:24,267
Great thinkin', Lincoln.

37
00:05:24,269 --> 00:05:25,568
Where'd you get this from?

38
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:26,437
At the, um,

39
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:29,505
the video store.

40
00:05:29,507 --> 00:05:31,042
Good one.

41
00:05:34,712 --> 00:05:37,212
I think one more and we're good.

42
00:05:37,214 --> 00:05:39,618
Kinda cradle it outta
the mud, you know?

43
00:05:49,127 --> 00:05:51,226
Seriously!

44
00:05:51,228 --> 00:05:52,764
You coulda put my
eye out with that.

45
00:05:53,731 --> 00:05:57,235
Stop whining, you big baby.

46
00:05:59,236 --> 00:06:01,807
Maybe not my eye,
but I coulda got hurt.

47
00:06:02,974 --> 00:06:04,642
Safety first, dude!

48
00:06:05,976 --> 00:06:08,210
Says the man who's been

49
00:06:08,212 --> 00:06:11,483
dropping this shit in
the pond for years.

50
00:06:12,315 --> 00:06:13,150
Good one.

51
00:06:14,584 --> 00:06:18,156
Seriously, Jimmy, where the
hell you getting all this wood?

52
00:06:19,957 --> 00:06:20,959
It's here.

53
00:06:23,661 --> 00:06:24,829
It's nailed to this old

54
00:06:26,663 --> 00:06:31,301
'no trespassing' thing.

55
00:06:31,303 --> 00:06:32,335
What thing?

56
00:06:32,337 --> 00:06:33,835
I don't know.

57
00:06:33,837 --> 00:06:37,842
It's an old-looking
shack, I guess.

58
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:40,846
Maybe when this place
used to be jumping,

59
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:45,181
they used to use this
for storage for shit,

60
00:06:45,183 --> 00:06:47,452
back when they used to
come up here for gold.

61
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:49,287
That was here?

62
00:06:50,354 --> 00:06:51,786
You catch on quick.

63
00:06:51,788 --> 00:06:53,589
Gonna use you as my partner

64
00:06:53,591 --> 00:06:58,597
when I start Grover's Vintage
VHS and Head Shop Inc.

65
00:07:03,134 --> 00:07:04,369
Hey, be careful over there.

66
00:07:05,536 --> 00:07:06,536
You might lose your head.

67
00:07:06,538 --> 00:07:07,803
What?

68
00:07:08,705 --> 00:07:10,472
You don't watch horror movies?

69
00:07:10,474 --> 00:07:14,109
This is where a guy jumps out
with a mask and a machete.

70
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:25,887
Dude, quit making so
much noise over there.

71
00:08:07,932 --> 00:08:09,364
Maxine is here!

72
00:08:09,366 --> 00:08:10,666
I'm leaving, Uncle Brody!

73
00:08:10,668 --> 00:08:11,670
Coming, Max!

74
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:20,075
Hi.

75
00:08:20,077 --> 00:08:20,909
Hey, love.

76
00:08:20,911 --> 00:08:21,743
So, where's Dylan?

77
00:08:21,745 --> 00:08:22,777
I couldn't get him up.

78
00:08:22,779 --> 00:08:23,945
He was up all last night

79
00:08:23,947 --> 00:08:25,782
working on his
livestreaming show.

80
00:08:25,784 --> 00:08:28,082
That's okay, he'll just
have to drive in with Brody.

81
00:08:28,084 --> 00:08:30,719
But we have a lot to do to
get the campgrounds ready

82
00:08:30,721 --> 00:08:31,856
in just a few days.

83
00:08:33,024 --> 00:08:34,257
I hope I don't
screw anything up.

84
00:08:34,259 --> 00:08:35,457
Oh, you will.

85
00:08:35,459 --> 00:08:38,294
But that's okay,
you're just a kid.

86
00:08:38,296 --> 00:08:41,630
And besides, this is
your first real job!

87
00:08:41,632 --> 00:08:43,868
Oh my god, high five, yeah!

88
00:08:45,637 --> 00:08:50,273
It's my first job, bitches!

89
00:08:50,275 --> 00:08:53,408
So, was your
uncle up when you left?

90
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:55,544
I heard him coughing earlier.

91
00:08:55,546 --> 00:08:57,145
Oh my god, it's
because of all the drinking

92
00:08:57,147 --> 00:08:58,547
and smoking that cigar.

93
00:08:58,549 --> 00:09:01,717
He's got that old-man
morning cough.

94
00:09:01,719 --> 00:09:04,819
Oh my gosh, no, wait,
that's so true.

95
00:09:04,821 --> 00:09:06,954
It's so
gross, but I love him.

96
00:09:06,956 --> 00:09:08,124
I know.

97
00:09:08,126 --> 00:09:09,058
Aww!

98
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:09,991
He's a good guy.

99
00:09:09,993 --> 00:09:11,659
He is a good guy.

100
00:09:11,661 --> 00:09:13,795
I left his uniform?

101
00:09:13,797 --> 00:09:15,230
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

102
00:09:15,232 --> 00:09:16,664
I ironed it.

103
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:17,632
Oh!

104
00:09:17,634 --> 00:09:18,600
He better get ready!

105
00:09:18,602 --> 00:09:19,736
That's wife material!

106
00:09:19,738 --> 00:09:20,836
I...

107
00:09:20,838 --> 00:09:22,838
Have you said that to him?

108
00:09:35,987 --> 00:09:38,087
Dylan, are you still here?

109
00:09:38,089 --> 00:09:40,525
You were supposed to head
out with Maxine, your cousin.

110
00:09:41,691 --> 00:09:43,861
I'm sorry, Uncle
Brody, I forgot.

111
00:09:47,766 --> 00:09:48,767
You forgot?

112
00:09:55,705 --> 00:09:57,875
You didn't forget that
video game at 2 AM.

113
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:02,278
Surprised you get
cell service up here.

114
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:05,213
Well, it's not a video
game, it's a livestream,

115
00:10:05,215 --> 00:10:07,048
and, yeah, you are right.

116
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:08,619
The service is a bit spotty.

117
00:10:10,621 --> 00:10:12,557
Can I stay home
today, Uncle Brody?

118
00:10:16,728 --> 00:10:17,796
You sick, boy?

119
00:10:19,162 --> 00:10:20,395
No.

120
00:10:20,397 --> 00:10:21,331
You got the runs?

121
00:10:22,565 --> 00:10:24,033
No.

122
00:10:24,035 --> 00:10:25,804
I should after
dinner last night.

123
00:10:27,537 --> 00:10:29,739
Then you're not staying home.

124
00:10:29,741 --> 00:10:30,575
But,

125
00:10:32,042 --> 00:10:33,342
I'm tired!

126
00:10:33,344 --> 00:10:35,847
Can't I just relax,
like even a little bit?

127
00:10:37,581 --> 00:10:38,515
Relax a bit?

128
00:10:40,685 --> 00:10:41,918
No.

129
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,252
Get up, make your
bed, get washed up.

130
00:10:44,254 --> 00:10:46,353
We're outta here in an hour.

131
00:10:46,355 --> 00:10:49,526
Fine, I'll get ready.

132
00:10:52,397 --> 00:10:55,867
Millennials.

133
00:10:57,602 --> 00:10:59,103
Ah, thank you, Maxie.

134
00:11:00,438 --> 00:11:01,239
I so love you.

135
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:07,612
And thank you, Lord, for
giving me another day.

136
00:11:10,781 --> 00:11:13,115
I don't hear that
shower running yet!

137
00:11:13,117 --> 00:11:13,952
Kiddo!

138
00:11:15,118 --> 00:11:16,619
I'm going,
Uncle Brody, I'm going!

139
00:11:23,294 --> 00:11:25,928
Chief Brody MacReady.

140
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:27,799
Sure, we'd love to
have you come down.

141
00:11:28,965 --> 00:11:30,467
Can you call us
back in 20 minutes?

142
00:11:31,701 --> 00:11:32,736
All right, thank you.

143
00:11:41,478 --> 00:11:42,712
Camp Taghkanic Lake
State Park and Campground.

144
00:11:42,714 --> 00:11:43,978
How can I help you?

145
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:45,814
Deanna, good morning, sweetie.

146
00:11:45,816 --> 00:11:47,316
Oh, hey Chief.

147
00:11:47,318 --> 00:11:49,150
Hey, can you take the phones
off night mode forwarding

148
00:11:49,152 --> 00:11:50,986
and route them
back to the office?

149
00:11:50,988 --> 00:11:51,952
Oh.

150
00:11:51,954 --> 00:11:52,755
Are they still on night mode?

151
00:11:52,757 --> 00:11:54,323
Hold on.

152
00:11:54,325 --> 00:11:55,590
They are.

153
00:11:55,592 --> 00:11:57,459
I'm sorry, I will take
care of it for you.

154
00:11:57,461 --> 00:11:59,160
Yeah, great.

155
00:11:59,162 --> 00:12:00,562
All right, I'll see you shortly.

156
00:12:00,564 --> 00:12:02,898
Okay, no worries, see ya soon.

157
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:03,668
Thank you.

158
00:12:07,238 --> 00:12:08,805
Oh God, the coffee.

159
00:12:25,289 --> 00:12:26,191
Let's go!

160
00:12:28,859 --> 00:12:30,494
Geez, I'm coming.

161
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:36,300
Let's go, Ranger Brody.

162
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,675
Ahem!

163
00:12:45,975 --> 00:12:48,778
We're gonna be late, Smokey.

164
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:49,613
Millennials.

165
00:12:51,983 --> 00:12:53,215
Who you texting?

166
00:12:53,217 --> 00:12:54,216
I'm not
texting anyone.

167
00:12:54,218 --> 00:12:55,353
I'm uploading a video.

168
00:12:56,853 --> 00:12:57,852
Never mind.

169
00:12:57,854 --> 00:12:59,221
Let's get in work mode.

170
00:12:59,223 --> 00:13:00,791
It's the summer, Uncle B.

171
00:13:03,393 --> 00:13:05,360
And what does that mean?

172
00:13:05,362 --> 00:13:06,562
Doesn't mean you get a pass.

173
00:13:06,564 --> 00:13:08,730
No, not with me.

174
00:13:08,732 --> 00:13:10,164
Told your father I'd
take you for the summer

175
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:12,635
and teach you the
finer things in life.

176
00:13:12,637 --> 00:13:14,336
Like getting laid.

177
00:13:14,338 --> 00:13:15,170
What?

178
00:13:15,172 --> 00:13:16,572
No.

179
00:13:16,574 --> 00:13:19,073
I'm talking about
the outdoors, sports,

180
00:13:19,075 --> 00:13:21,076
interacting with
kids your own age,

181
00:13:21,078 --> 00:13:23,481
rather than sitting behind
a laptop all summer.

182
00:13:24,748 --> 00:13:26,914
Maybe teach you some
survival skills?

183
00:13:34,391 --> 00:13:35,226
Okay.

184
00:13:42,599 --> 00:13:44,765
Then maybe you can
get yourself laid,

185
00:13:44,767 --> 00:13:46,000
as long as you understand
what that means.

186
00:13:46,002 --> 00:13:47,269
Protect yourself.

187
00:13:47,271 --> 00:13:48,571
Use a con...

188
00:13:48,573 --> 00:13:49,571
Are we seriously gonna
have this conversation?

189
00:13:49,573 --> 00:13:51,042
I was just kidding, Uncle B.

190
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:09,793
We can, if you'd like.

191
00:14:11,961 --> 00:14:13,130
Nah.

192
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:36,154
This is
ridiculous, I'm so tired.

193
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,654
Oh wait, here
we go, here we go.

194
00:14:38,656 --> 00:14:39,987
Hey, hey.

195
00:14:39,989 --> 00:14:40,956
Hey now.

196
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:41,793
Hey.

197
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,959
Hey.

198
00:14:44,961 --> 00:14:45,894
Hello?

199
00:14:45,896 --> 00:14:47,298
Hey, hey!

200
00:14:48,132 --> 00:14:49,334
Aw, come on!

201
00:14:50,401 --> 00:14:51,832
Jesus Christ!

202
00:14:51,834 --> 00:14:53,903
Steve, how much longer?

203
00:14:53,905 --> 00:14:54,736
I don't know.

204
00:14:54,738 --> 00:14:56,074
A mile, maybe two.

205
00:15:26,871 --> 00:15:28,202
Morning, Charlie.

206
00:15:28,204 --> 00:15:29,873
Looking real good, nice job.

207
00:15:32,042 --> 00:15:33,543
That dude is disturbing.

208
00:15:34,711 --> 00:15:35,879
He's had a tough life.

209
00:15:37,013 --> 00:15:38,212
Is Lenny still on schedule

210
00:15:38,214 --> 00:15:39,883
for the final
inspection tomorrow?

211
00:15:41,185 --> 00:15:42,650
What'd he go to
prison or something?

212
00:15:42,652 --> 00:15:44,553
That's what I always
love about you, Charlie.

213
00:15:44,555 --> 00:15:46,221
You always get things done.

214
00:15:46,223 --> 00:15:47,125
Let's talk later.

215
00:15:50,393 --> 00:15:51,726
No.

216
00:15:51,728 --> 00:15:52,895
He lost everything he loved

217
00:15:52,897 --> 00:15:54,732
to the Thomas wildfire
a few years ago.

218
00:15:55,898 --> 00:15:56,733
I wanted to help.

219
00:15:57,901 --> 00:15:59,570
Gave him a job and
a place to live.

220
00:16:01,037 --> 00:16:04,239
He lives in one of the vacant
cabins down by the stables.

221
00:16:04,241 --> 00:16:05,510
Oh, I didn't know that.

222
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:10,345
'Cause he's a real person,
not something you plug in.

223
00:16:10,347 --> 00:16:11,847
Learn much more about people

224
00:16:11,849 --> 00:16:14,151
once you pop the cartridge
outta the game console.

225
00:16:15,352 --> 00:16:16,421
What's a cartridge?

226
00:16:20,023 --> 00:16:21,557
Millennials.

227
00:16:24,228 --> 00:16:25,895
Camp Taghkanic Lake
State Park and Campground.

228
00:16:25,897 --> 00:16:26,930
How can I help you?

229
00:16:28,565 --> 00:16:30,435
Oh sure, yeah, no
problem at all!

230
00:16:32,002 --> 00:16:34,372
Okay, I'm gonna put you
on hold for one second.

231
00:16:35,705 --> 00:16:36,538
Hey, Deanna.

232
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:37,771
Hey, you!

233
00:16:37,773 --> 00:16:38,941
Oh, I have shirts
for you and Naomi.

234
00:16:38,943 --> 00:16:40,175
We just got 'em in.

235
00:16:40,177 --> 00:16:41,610
You a medium?

236
00:16:41,612 --> 00:16:43,412
I'm a small, but I'll
take a medium for my cousin.

237
00:16:43,414 --> 00:16:44,545
Okay, perfect.

238
00:16:44,547 --> 00:16:46,414
All of the sizes
should be in the boxes.

239
00:16:46,416 --> 00:16:48,384
Also, later on, these need
to go in the storage area

240
00:16:48,386 --> 00:16:49,550
in the basement.

241
00:16:49,552 --> 00:16:50,452
We got a small
delivery in as well.

242
00:16:50,454 --> 00:16:51,452
Can you take those too?

243
00:16:51,454 --> 00:16:53,621
- Yeah, sure.
- Perfect, okay.

244
00:16:55,059 --> 00:16:57,092
Yes, I'm back.

245
00:16:57,094 --> 00:16:58,626
Huh, okay, cabin one.

246
00:16:58,628 --> 00:16:59,894
That's weird, it looks like
we have a Marion in cabin...

247
00:16:59,896 --> 00:17:02,029
Oh, cabin four; I
gotcha, I gotcha.

248
00:17:02,031 --> 00:17:03,531
No, thank you for
sticking around.

249
00:17:03,533 --> 00:17:05,266
No problem at all, I'll get
somebody right over there.

250
00:17:05,268 --> 00:17:06,134
Okay, thanks again.

251
00:17:06,136 --> 00:17:07,135
Bye-bye now.

252
00:17:07,137 --> 00:17:08,205
Morning, Chief.

253
00:17:09,072 --> 00:17:10,572
Here you go.

254
00:17:10,574 --> 00:17:11,773
Just wanna let you know

255
00:17:11,775 --> 00:17:14,141
that we all can breathe
a little better now.

256
00:17:14,143 --> 00:17:16,410
Everything is
perfect and in order.

257
00:17:16,412 --> 00:17:18,313
PH levels are straight.

258
00:17:18,315 --> 00:17:19,880
There's no negative readouts

259
00:17:19,882 --> 00:17:22,316
or any toxins
surrounding the lake

260
00:17:22,318 --> 00:17:26,255
to the beach to a three-mile
radius around the campground.

261
00:17:26,257 --> 00:17:30,325
And I'll make sure I check
on the tunnels in the fall.

262
00:17:30,327 --> 00:17:31,560
Deputy Jaeckel,
it sounds exciting.

263
00:17:31,562 --> 00:17:33,062
What are you telling me?

264
00:17:33,064 --> 00:17:37,131
I am saying
congratulations,

265
00:17:37,133 --> 00:17:40,334
Chief Park Ranger
Brody MacReady.

266
00:17:43,173 --> 00:17:44,805
Yes, sir!

267
00:17:44,807 --> 00:17:47,508
After 27 years sitting dormant,

268
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:52,313
your park and campground is
officially open to the public.

269
00:17:52,315 --> 00:17:55,786
Sir, you are official.

270
00:17:59,289 --> 00:18:01,523
I mean, we did have the
temporary one hanging up,

271
00:18:01,525 --> 00:18:03,958
but now we got the actual one.

272
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,596
Wow, this is exciting,
this new chapter in my life.

273
00:18:07,863 --> 00:18:10,631
The land is officially ready!

274
00:18:10,633 --> 00:18:13,034
Yes!

275
00:18:13,036 --> 00:18:15,637
And congrats to all
you fine park rangers

276
00:18:15,639 --> 00:18:17,341
for your hard work
and dedication.

277
00:18:19,509 --> 00:18:20,644
This place was a dump.

278
00:18:21,545 --> 00:18:23,378
Companies drove for miles to use

279
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:25,049
this place as
their own landfill.

280
00:18:26,283 --> 00:18:28,516
Hundreds of animals died
from the various toxins

281
00:18:28,518 --> 00:18:31,219
that were poured into the
lake and seeped into the soil.

282
00:18:31,221 --> 00:18:34,522
But with you, several members
of Congress' hard work,

283
00:18:34,524 --> 00:18:36,056
we were able to
clean this place up

284
00:18:36,058 --> 00:18:38,659
and turn it back into
a state park again.

285
00:18:38,661 --> 00:18:41,062
Now this is the beginning.

286
00:18:41,064 --> 00:18:42,698
We have a lotta work
to finish this weekend

287
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:45,668
before we officially
reopen next week.

288
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:46,504
But thank you.

289
00:18:47,738 --> 00:18:49,574
Let's keep this
thing going.

290
00:18:52,575 --> 00:18:54,743
Chief, are we still offering
that early-bird special.

291
00:18:54,745 --> 00:18:56,745
Yeah, we'll turn that till
the end of the weekend, yes.

292
00:18:56,747 --> 00:18:57,981
How are the bookings going?

293
00:18:59,048 --> 00:19:00,047
Almost at capacity.

294
00:19:00,049 --> 00:19:01,585
- Which week?
- All of them.

295
00:19:02,753 --> 00:19:04,919
Okay, yeah.

296
00:19:04,921 --> 00:19:06,053
Okay, thank you.

297
00:19:06,055 --> 00:19:08,657
Hey, again,
congratulations, Chief.

298
00:19:08,659 --> 00:19:10,258
I'm gonna go out
and make some runs

299
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:13,428
and just wanted to let
you know I'm proud of you.

300
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:15,330
Matter of fact, let
me rephrase that.

301
00:19:15,332 --> 00:19:17,032
I'm proud of all of us.

302
00:19:17,034 --> 00:19:18,600
Yes, sir.

303
00:19:22,005 --> 00:19:23,271
Ohhh.

304
00:19:23,273 --> 00:19:24,906
Ohhhhhh.

305
00:19:24,908 --> 00:19:26,507
I'm so proud of
you, Uncle Brody.

306
00:19:26,509 --> 00:19:27,708
Thanks, honey.

307
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:29,279
You work so hard,
and you did it.

308
00:19:30,347 --> 00:19:31,615
You do use it.

309
00:19:32,749 --> 00:19:34,015
Oh, how would that look?

310
00:19:34,017 --> 00:19:35,950
My niece stays with
me the whole summer

311
00:19:35,952 --> 00:19:37,719
and I don't use her gift?

312
00:19:37,721 --> 00:19:41,556
Wait, so you're only
using it because I'm here?

313
00:19:41,558 --> 00:19:42,756
Ohhh.

314
00:19:42,758 --> 00:19:44,525
No, no no no, he
uses it all the time.

315
00:19:44,527 --> 00:19:46,428
Come here, come here, Naomi.

316
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:48,062
I wanna get you organized.

317
00:19:48,064 --> 00:19:51,134
Okay, and look at you,
you're doing great.

318
00:19:53,136 --> 00:19:56,071
Maxine, thanks for going
the extra mile with her.

319
00:19:56,073 --> 00:19:57,708
Aww, you got it, babe.

320
00:19:59,075 --> 00:20:01,208
I mean Chief Babe.

321
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:02,078
Yeah.

322
00:20:03,814 --> 00:20:06,046
Okay, so listen, troops,
this what we're gonna do.

323
00:20:06,048 --> 00:20:07,881
We're gonna go down
to the basement.

324
00:20:07,883 --> 00:20:09,150
We're gonna take all the folders

325
00:20:09,152 --> 00:20:11,386
and put them on
the shelves, okay?

326
00:20:11,388 --> 00:20:14,288
Okay, so yesterday you
said that you wanted us

327
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:16,992
to file some in
the storage room.

328
00:20:16,994 --> 00:20:18,893
Do you still want us to do
that since we'll be down there?

329
00:20:18,895 --> 00:20:21,496
Naomi needs help putting up
the boxes in the storage room.

330
00:20:21,498 --> 00:20:22,964
Okay, we'll
definitely do that,

331
00:20:22,966 --> 00:20:27,002
but I need to tackle
that souvenir shop, okay?

332
00:20:27,004 --> 00:20:28,902
That's right, well, I can
help clean up the basement

333
00:20:28,904 --> 00:20:30,338
if Naomi helps me with that.

334
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:31,739
Okay, yeah,
that's a good idea.

335
00:20:31,741 --> 00:20:32,940
So this is what we'll do.

336
00:20:32,942 --> 00:20:35,476
We will clean up the
room, and then take care

337
00:20:35,478 --> 00:20:38,012
of the paperwork, I'll
take you guys out to lunch,

338
00:20:38,014 --> 00:20:40,015
and then we'll do the
souvenir shop, deal?

339
00:20:40,017 --> 00:20:40,851
Yeah.

340
00:20:42,251 --> 00:20:44,320
Good job, thank you.

341
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:56,430
Steve, how much longer?

342
00:20:56,432 --> 00:20:59,434
I don't know, a
mile, maybe two.

343
00:20:59,436 --> 00:21:01,369
You said that four miles ago.

344
00:21:01,371 --> 00:21:03,204
I just don't get why
no one wants to pick up

345
00:21:03,206 --> 00:21:05,172
hitchhikers anymore,
it's like everyone's

346
00:21:05,174 --> 00:21:06,874
just out for themselves.

347
00:21:06,876 --> 00:21:09,277
Because don't
wanna get kidnapped.

348
00:21:09,279 --> 00:21:11,545
Kidnapped? Amy,
we're in the mountains,

349
00:21:11,547 --> 00:21:14,349
not the fricking
third-world country.

350
00:21:14,351 --> 00:21:16,184
Don't be so naive, Steve.

351
00:21:16,186 --> 00:21:19,287
This is where the nut jobs
breed, in these mountains.

352
00:21:19,289 --> 00:21:22,189
The Santa Maria
Mountains, are you kidding?

353
00:21:22,191 --> 00:21:23,691
No, why are you
laughing at me?

354
00:21:23,693 --> 00:21:25,560
Because, that was funny.

355
00:21:25,562 --> 00:21:26,731
- Really?
- Really.

356
00:21:27,898 --> 00:21:29,563
I think this is
the campground.

357
00:21:29,565 --> 00:21:33,136
We just have to find
the lodge to check in.

358
00:21:38,542 --> 00:21:40,309
I think I heard something.

359
00:21:40,311 --> 00:21:43,911
It sounds like it's
moving around us.

360
00:21:43,913 --> 00:21:47,151
Oooo, what's the matter?

361
00:21:49,319 --> 00:21:50,084
Well I think
I heard something.

362
00:21:50,086 --> 00:21:51,084
What, a car?

363
00:21:51,086 --> 00:21:52,653
No, I think I heard like a...

364
00:21:52,655 --> 00:21:55,023
A mass killer trying to
stalk us on the way to camp?

365
00:21:55,025 --> 00:21:59,393
No, schmuck, I think I
heard a growl or something.

366
00:21:59,395 --> 00:22:00,696
Like, as in an animal.

367
00:22:03,165 --> 00:22:04,198
An animal?

368
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,066
Yes, we are in the mountains.

369
00:22:06,068 --> 00:22:08,437
An animal growl, like a tiger?

370
00:22:08,439 --> 00:22:10,940
A tiger, where do
you think we are?

371
00:22:13,176 --> 00:22:14,709
I meant mountain
lion, not tiger.

372
00:22:14,711 --> 00:22:17,280
You said tiger,
who even says that?

373
00:23:03,959 --> 00:23:05,429
Help me, please.

374
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:06,289
Ooh, creepy.

375
00:24:16,834 --> 00:24:19,367
Yeah, I'm good
carrying that big box.

376
00:24:19,369 --> 00:24:22,871
Thank you for asking,
really appreciate it.

377
00:24:22,873 --> 00:24:23,908
Oh, you're welcome.

378
00:24:26,142 --> 00:24:28,211
This place gives me
the heeby jeebies.

379
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:31,015
Yeah.

380
00:24:32,382 --> 00:24:34,882
I hate storage rooms with tools.

381
00:24:34,884 --> 00:24:38,252
There are just too many bad
things that could happen.

382
00:24:38,254 --> 00:24:41,255
Yeah, someone definitely
got killed here.

383
00:24:41,257 --> 00:24:42,526
Why would you say that?

384
00:24:45,094 --> 00:24:45,930
What's this?

385
00:24:50,267 --> 00:24:51,101
Whooaaa.

386
00:24:56,238 --> 00:25:00,441
I don't know what that is.

387
00:25:00,443 --> 00:25:02,178
I wonder
what's in here.

388
00:25:04,113 --> 00:25:08,082
Oh my gosh , it
smells really bad, though.

389
00:25:08,084 --> 00:25:09,784
Come on, let's check this out.

390
00:25:09,786 --> 00:25:10,754
It's windy in here.

391
00:25:11,621 --> 00:25:12,954
I bet it leads to somewhere.

392
00:25:12,956 --> 00:25:13,924
The outside?

393
00:25:14,891 --> 00:25:16,557
Go on, Captain Obvious.

394
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:18,227
I know the wind is scary.

395
00:25:21,797 --> 00:25:25,131
Actually, when I
was a little girl,

396
00:25:25,133 --> 00:25:28,136
I always thought that
the howling of the wind

397
00:25:28,138 --> 00:25:30,708
meant something bad
was gonna happen.

398
00:25:33,476 --> 00:25:34,708
Huh.

399
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:37,879
Okay, cool theory there, loser.

400
00:25:37,881 --> 00:25:39,380
Thanks.

401
00:25:39,382 --> 00:25:41,149
Come on, let's check out
this part of the tunnel.

402
00:25:41,151 --> 00:25:42,820
Yeah, like that's
gonna happen.

403
00:25:44,054 --> 00:25:46,256
Come on, where's your
sense of adventure, Cuz?

404
00:25:47,824 --> 00:25:48,922
I think it's a tunnel.

405
00:25:48,924 --> 00:25:52,593
A hallway, something like that?

406
00:25:52,595 --> 00:25:54,161
There's gotta be an exit,
because that's what's

407
00:25:54,163 --> 00:25:56,831
trapping the wind,
right, there's a draft?

408
00:25:56,833 --> 00:25:59,265
It's a mining shaft.

409
00:25:59,267 --> 00:26:00,735
It hasn't been used in forever,

410
00:26:00,737 --> 00:26:03,103
so it's probably
dangerous as hell.

411
00:26:03,105 --> 00:26:05,675
No upkeep means craziness.

412
00:26:07,844 --> 00:26:10,178
I heard my mom talking
about it with Uncle Brody.

413
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:12,846
You know that's the reason why
him and Aunt Linda broke up?

414
00:26:12,848 --> 00:26:16,519
She didn't want him to do
this, but, it was his passion.

415
00:26:17,853 --> 00:26:19,821
Yeah, I never really
liked Aunt Linda.

416
00:26:19,823 --> 00:26:22,325
She had those really hairy
arms and that mustache.

417
00:26:24,094 --> 00:26:26,361
Though, I do think
Maxine is pretty hot.

418
00:26:26,363 --> 00:26:28,263
Okay, let's be respectful.

419
00:26:28,265 --> 00:26:30,534
Come on, let's check this
section of the tunnel out.

420
00:26:31,869 --> 00:26:32,703
Yo!

421
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:40,644
Pinocchio!

422
00:27:14,076 --> 00:27:17,847
Okay, I'm pretty sure I
heard something back there.

423
00:27:19,082 --> 00:27:20,084
Yo ho!

424
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:29,026
Uh.

425
00:27:30,226 --> 00:27:31,426
I don't like this.

426
00:27:31,428 --> 00:27:33,061
Yo, what's up, my
bitches?

427
00:27:33,063 --> 00:27:34,595
Bitches?

428
00:27:34,597 --> 00:27:35,932
I'm not a bitch.

429
00:27:36,933 --> 00:27:38,765
I'm not a bitch!

430
00:27:38,767 --> 00:27:40,434
We're here live in the tunnel,

431
00:27:40,436 --> 00:27:41,602
checking out some creepy shit.

432
00:27:41,604 --> 00:27:43,036
Dylan, seriously, stop.

433
00:27:43,038 --> 00:27:44,171
Why?

434
00:27:44,173 --> 00:27:46,006
I'm sorry, it's just

435
00:27:46,008 --> 00:27:47,774
creeping me out,
okay, can we just go,

436
00:27:47,776 --> 00:27:49,379
get lunch with Maxine, okay?

437
00:28:00,958 --> 00:28:02,456
What was that?

438
00:28:02,458 --> 00:28:04,860
Something you need
to go check out.

439
00:28:04,862 --> 00:28:05,696
Don't, stop!

440
00:28:56,145 --> 00:28:56,979
Octavia.

441
00:28:58,148 --> 00:28:59,183
Oh, hey Marge.

442
00:29:00,415 --> 00:29:01,851
Yeah yeah yeah, how are you?

443
00:29:03,486 --> 00:29:05,686
How's the real estate business?

444
00:29:06,956 --> 00:29:08,188
Yeah, okay.

445
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:10,760
Um, yeah.

446
00:29:12,828 --> 00:29:16,165
Naw, when can I come
check out the property?

447
00:29:18,634 --> 00:29:19,867
Tomorrow?

448
00:29:19,869 --> 00:29:21,701
Today, no no no, I
can't do it today.

449
00:29:21,703 --> 00:29:23,039
I'm off tomorrow.

450
00:29:24,873 --> 00:29:27,110
Yeah yeah yeah, I can't do it.

451
00:29:28,311 --> 00:29:29,146
Right.

452
00:29:30,447 --> 00:29:31,481
Yeah, I understand.

453
00:29:32,815 --> 00:29:35,449
Yeah, we're reopening next week.

454
00:29:35,552 --> 00:29:38,622
Yeah,
Santa Maria Mountains.

455
00:29:40,222 --> 00:29:41,723
Yeah but we definitely
cannot do it then.

456
00:29:41,725 --> 00:29:44,158
It'd take me and
my wife two hours

457
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:46,326
to come to Los Angeles,
but look, Marge,

458
00:29:46,328 --> 00:29:47,795
I definitely have to
get off the phone.

459
00:29:47,797 --> 00:29:50,566
We'll talk about, talk
about the property later.

460
00:29:52,001 --> 00:29:54,738
All right, all right,
take care, Marge, bye-bye.

461
00:29:57,574 --> 00:29:58,505
Hello?

462
00:30:04,247 --> 00:30:05,916
Is anybody out here?

463
00:30:09,084 --> 00:30:11,085
Johnny, you see anybody?

464
00:30:11,087 --> 00:30:11,988
Good boy, stay.

465
00:30:13,256 --> 00:30:14,423
This is a park ranger.

466
00:30:16,426 --> 00:30:17,725
What is going on?

467
00:30:34,744 --> 00:30:36,079
Don't see anybody out here.

468
00:30:39,548 --> 00:30:40,349
Hello?

469
00:30:42,084 --> 00:30:43,085
Park ranger.

470
00:30:45,087 --> 00:30:46,254
Hello?

471
00:30:46,256 --> 00:30:47,056
Is any?

472
00:30:51,026 --> 00:30:52,360
What the?

473
00:30:56,431 --> 00:30:57,233
Shit?

474
00:30:59,635 --> 00:31:01,201
Ohhhh.

475
00:31:01,203 --> 00:31:02,438
This is insane.

476
00:31:24,727 --> 00:31:27,629
I'm at the deluxe
cabin to see DiStefano.

477
00:31:27,631 --> 00:31:28,598
Copy that, Chief.

478
00:31:31,901 --> 00:31:33,434
DiStefanos?

479
00:31:33,436 --> 00:31:35,602
Oh, he's probably checking
in on the scratch noises.

480
00:31:35,604 --> 00:31:37,103
That makes sense.

481
00:31:37,105 --> 00:31:38,642
Did I call the extermin,
did I call the exterminator?

482
00:31:40,276 --> 00:31:42,845
I didn't call the exterminator.

483
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:04,865
He's in the back,
he's finishing off a couple of things.

484
00:32:04,867 --> 00:32:05,801
Great, thank you.

485
00:32:07,202 --> 00:32:08,637
Hey, Paulie, who was that?

486
00:32:09,505 --> 00:32:11,839
Oh, you.

487
00:32:11,841 --> 00:32:12,843
Yeah, come on in.

488
00:32:15,944 --> 00:32:16,779
How are you?

489
00:32:17,947 --> 00:32:22,050
So, can I get you
a drink or something?

490
00:32:22,052 --> 00:32:25,285
We have water,
sparkling or flat.

491
00:32:25,287 --> 00:32:27,988
Iced tea, beer and soda.

492
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:30,059
No, thank you, I
appreciate it, thanks.

493
00:32:31,193 --> 00:32:33,294
How about you, Paulie,
you want something?

494
00:32:33,296 --> 00:32:35,862
No, that's okay, I'm
good, thanks a lot.

495
00:32:35,864 --> 00:32:37,363
Sorry to keep you waiting.

496
00:32:37,365 --> 00:32:38,666
What can I do for you, Chief?

497
00:32:38,668 --> 00:32:40,300
I'm sorry, did
you hurt yourself?

498
00:32:40,302 --> 00:32:41,902
Do you need first-aid attention?

499
00:32:41,904 --> 00:32:43,838
No, no, it's the
craziest thing.

500
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,640
What's that?

501
00:32:45,642 --> 00:32:46,840
What?

502
00:32:46,842 --> 00:32:48,509
You said it's
the craziest thing.

503
00:32:48,511 --> 00:32:49,310
Yeah, it was.

504
00:32:49,312 --> 00:32:50,910
What's that?

505
00:32:50,912 --> 00:32:52,846
What can I do for you, Chief?

506
00:32:52,848 --> 00:32:54,081
Well, Mr. DiStefano, you...

507
00:32:54,083 --> 00:32:56,550
No, no, that's my father.

508
00:32:56,552 --> 00:32:57,551
You call me Marco.

509
00:32:57,553 --> 00:32:59,018
It's nice to meet you, Marco,

510
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:01,487
and welcome to Camp
Taghkanic Lake State Park.

511
00:33:01,489 --> 00:33:05,059
I am chief Brody McReady, I
am the park ranger in charge.

512
00:33:05,061 --> 00:33:08,763
Well, what can I do for
you, park ranger in charge?

513
00:33:08,765 --> 00:33:09,996
You had called the office,

514
00:33:09,998 --> 00:33:11,864
complaining about some
scratching noises.

515
00:33:11,866 --> 00:33:13,767
Oh yeah yeah yeah,
that was Paulie.

516
00:33:13,769 --> 00:33:16,437
He said there was some sorta
noise down in the basement.

517
00:33:16,439 --> 00:33:19,038
That was no frigging raccoon.

518
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:21,777
That noise was loud, I'm
thinking like a bear.

519
00:33:22,746 --> 00:33:23,944
Like a bear?

520
00:33:23,946 --> 00:33:25,211
Yeah.

521
00:33:25,213 --> 00:33:27,448
Like you know what a
bear sounds like, JoJo.

522
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:30,118
Did you hear a
scratching or a roar, bec...

523
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:33,687
Nah, it's scratching,
JoJo, scratching.

524
00:33:33,689 --> 00:33:37,358
Look, Benny heard
it too, ask him.

525
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,195
Benny?

526
00:33:39,595 --> 00:33:42,129
Yeah, Benny, he's a
little tied up right now.

527
00:33:42,131 --> 00:33:44,899
Look, you're probably right,
it was probably just a coon.

528
00:33:44,901 --> 00:33:49,469
You can't say that
anymore, Marco, it's racist.

529
00:33:49,471 --> 00:33:52,407
What's the matter with
you, have you gone stupid?

530
00:33:52,409 --> 00:33:55,043
I'm confused here.

531
00:33:55,045 --> 00:33:56,576
What just happened?

532
00:33:56,578 --> 00:33:59,048
Nothing, you're right, it
was probably just a raccoon.

533
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:03,319
How do we get this
raccoon to go away?

534
00:34:04,453 --> 00:34:05,620
I have an exterminator
coming by tomorrow.

535
00:34:05,622 --> 00:34:07,822
I can have him
stop by here first.

536
00:34:07,824 --> 00:34:09,156
That works.

537
00:34:09,158 --> 00:34:10,591
The exterminator's the
last thing to get done

538
00:34:10,593 --> 00:34:12,993
before we officially
reopen next week.

539
00:34:12,995 --> 00:34:14,594
What, reopen?

540
00:34:14,596 --> 00:34:16,496
Reopen back to the public.

541
00:34:16,498 --> 00:34:18,265
I have a few guests,
including yourself,

542
00:34:18,267 --> 00:34:20,801
that took advantage of
the early-bird special.

543
00:34:20,803 --> 00:34:22,669
We didn't even know
that was happening.

544
00:34:22,671 --> 00:34:26,073
So how
long you guys with us?

545
00:34:26,075 --> 00:34:27,775
We're trying to
sort that out now.

546
00:34:27,777 --> 00:34:30,777
You know, couple
days, maybe more.

547
00:34:30,779 --> 00:34:33,147
It just matters how
much Benny can take.

548
00:34:36,518 --> 00:34:38,185
Okay, well, I'll
leave you guys

549
00:34:38,187 --> 00:34:40,289
and coordinate with
the exterminator.

550
00:34:41,357 --> 00:34:42,790
Yeah yeah.

551
00:34:42,792 --> 00:34:45,158
Chief,
you got your ears on?

552
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:46,661
Yeah, Jaeckel.

553
00:34:46,663 --> 00:34:51,134
Hey, can you meet me by
the lake crossing by TK421?

554
00:34:52,468 --> 00:34:53,469
Sure, all good?

555
00:34:56,538 --> 00:34:57,707
Affirmative.

556
00:34:58,875 --> 00:35:00,708
All right, give me
15, I'm on my way.

557
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:02,375
Copy that.

558
00:35:02,377 --> 00:35:04,948
Ohhh, I cannot believe this.

559
00:35:06,882 --> 00:35:08,382
Well it was great
meeting you guys.

560
00:35:08,384 --> 00:35:10,384
Oh, please fill out
our little rating card.

561
00:35:10,386 --> 00:35:12,953
I would really appreciate your
feedback in staying with us.

562
00:35:12,955 --> 00:35:15,221
Yeah, and you'll get that
exterminator over here tomorrow?

563
00:35:15,223 --> 00:35:16,058
Yes, sir.

564
00:35:17,125 --> 00:35:18,227
Thank you, Mr. DiSte...

565
00:35:19,194 --> 00:35:20,062
Marco.

566
00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:22,799
Yeah, yeah, get outta here.

567
00:35:24,567 --> 00:35:26,169
What the hell's wrong with you?

568
00:35:40,815 --> 00:35:43,382
Yeah, so, just matches exactly

569
00:35:43,384 --> 00:35:44,888
like what Deputy Jaeckel says.

570
00:35:46,022 --> 00:35:48,188
All right, thanks.

571
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:49,824
Of course, Chief.

572
00:35:59,868 --> 00:36:01,100
Chief, so what now?

573
00:36:01,102 --> 00:36:02,569
What now?

574
00:36:02,571 --> 00:36:04,538
Let's get something
straight, this is my park.

575
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:07,708
I am responsible, I am
the chief park ranger.

576
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:09,676
I investigate first,
then I make the call.

577
00:36:09,678 --> 00:36:12,612
You do not call the state
police, an ambulance

578
00:36:12,614 --> 00:36:14,082
or even damn animal control,

579
00:36:14,084 --> 00:36:16,116
or anyone else
before calling me.

580
00:36:16,118 --> 00:36:17,384
Do you understand me?

581
00:36:17,386 --> 00:36:18,853
Sorry, Chief, I was
just following protocol.

582
00:36:18,855 --> 00:36:21,288
No, protocol
coulda stopped you

583
00:36:21,290 --> 00:36:24,290
when you called dispatch,
which you did not do.

584
00:36:24,292 --> 00:36:26,460
Now, I have a potential
frenzy, and we're back

585
00:36:26,462 --> 00:36:28,765
under the microscope
before the season begins.

586
00:36:30,065 --> 00:36:30,899
Jaeckel?

587
00:36:35,203 --> 00:36:36,640
What's all over your uniform?

588
00:36:38,207 --> 00:36:40,477
It's, um, it's shit, sir.

589
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:44,779
Yeah, smells like
rat shit actually.

590
00:36:44,781 --> 00:36:47,080
How do you even know
what rat shit smells like?

591
00:36:47,082 --> 00:36:49,750
I used to be an exterminator
back in the day, so

592
00:36:49,752 --> 00:36:50,984
dealt with it otherwise.

593
00:36:50,986 --> 00:36:52,154
All right, go get
yourself cleaned up.

594
00:36:53,321 --> 00:36:54,989
Look, Chief, I'm
sorry, I guess...

595
00:36:54,991 --> 00:36:57,391
No, I get it.

596
00:36:57,393 --> 00:36:58,826
You're new at this.

597
00:36:58,828 --> 00:37:01,129
It's totally different than
being a youth counselor.

598
00:37:01,131 --> 00:37:03,496
But you can't sound the
alarm at everything you find.

599
00:37:03,498 --> 00:37:05,834
That'll cause chaos,
people could get hurt.

600
00:37:07,002 --> 00:37:09,236
Follow the standard
operating procedures.

601
00:37:09,238 --> 00:37:12,839
All right, safety
first, all around.

602
00:37:12,841 --> 00:37:13,676
Cool?

603
00:37:15,176 --> 00:37:16,011
Yes, sir.

604
00:37:17,245 --> 00:37:19,014
Come back when
you get cleaned up.

605
00:37:21,517 --> 00:37:23,953
You're right, you
smell like shit.

606
00:37:29,192 --> 00:37:31,824
Smell like rat shit.

607
00:37:37,098 --> 00:37:39,165
Okay, so tomorrow,
what do you say you and I

608
00:37:39,167 --> 00:37:41,000
have a girls' day together?

609
00:37:41,002 --> 00:37:41,835
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah.

610
00:37:41,837 --> 00:37:43,203
Yeah.

611
00:37:43,205 --> 00:37:46,205
Well, does that
mean no work or like?

612
00:37:46,207 --> 00:37:48,341
Well, tomorrow is Sunday,
so usually we only have

613
00:37:48,343 --> 00:37:50,509
like a half a day, so I
was thinking we could go

614
00:37:50,511 --> 00:37:52,712
to the lake, get our tans on,

615
00:37:52,714 --> 00:37:54,348
you know, before the
season gets really busy.

616
00:37:54,350 --> 00:37:55,683
Yeah, that sounds really fun.

617
00:37:55,685 --> 00:37:57,118
Yeah.

618
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:59,520
Well, I don't know if Uncle
Brody's gonna let me go.

619
00:37:59,522 --> 00:38:01,221
Hello, I got you, okay.

620
00:38:01,223 --> 00:38:02,892
It's totally me
and you.

621
00:38:05,794 --> 00:38:08,063
Did my mom play
with you guys growing up?

622
00:38:09,031 --> 00:38:10,464
She did.

623
00:38:10,466 --> 00:38:11,665
She was a bit older
than your uncle,

624
00:38:11,667 --> 00:38:13,236
so she had her own friends.

625
00:38:15,071 --> 00:38:19,640
She was very good at sports
like basketball, handball.

626
00:38:19,642 --> 00:38:20,406
Really?

627
00:38:20,408 --> 00:38:21,741
Yeah.

628
00:38:21,743 --> 00:38:23,411
Huh.

629
00:38:23,413 --> 00:38:25,078
I had no idea.

630
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:28,017
She never talked to
us about any of that.

631
00:38:29,151 --> 00:38:30,083
Then again, she
never really talked

632
00:38:30,085 --> 00:38:32,152
about her childhood at all.

633
00:38:32,154 --> 00:38:33,420
We all had a great childhood.

634
00:38:33,422 --> 00:38:36,690
Our parents weren't
rich, but we felt rich.

635
00:38:36,692 --> 00:38:39,592
They bought us just enough
things for us to be happy.

636
00:38:39,594 --> 00:38:41,064
Always showed us love.

637
00:38:42,397 --> 00:38:44,433
That's what we continue
to do with you guys.

638
00:38:48,004 --> 00:38:49,902
Yeah, the call
was made to him.

639
00:38:49,904 --> 00:38:51,908
He just gave us orders
to prep the room.

640
00:38:53,107 --> 00:38:54,607
When did he say
he was gonna come?

641
00:38:54,609 --> 00:38:56,345
I don't know,
sometime tomorrow.

642
00:38:57,513 --> 00:38:58,745
Where's Paulie?

643
00:38:58,747 --> 00:39:01,082
You know Paulie,
he's on the shitter,

644
00:39:01,084 --> 00:39:03,286
or he's on the phone,
who knows where he is?

645
00:39:05,254 --> 00:39:09,455
Hey, Benny, just tell me why,
that's all we need to know.

646
00:39:09,457 --> 00:39:11,560
Then this whole thing'll
be over quickly.

647
00:39:13,096 --> 00:39:13,930
Come on, Benny.

648
00:39:15,297 --> 00:39:17,433
I'll even personally
take care of your family.

649
00:39:18,767 --> 00:39:21,471
I never sold you out, never.

650
00:39:22,437 --> 00:39:23,969
This is wrong.

651
00:39:23,971 --> 00:39:26,373
I took the oath for you guys.

652
00:39:26,375 --> 00:39:27,877
Why would I do it?

653
00:39:28,977 --> 00:39:30,643
I am not a rat.

654
00:39:33,114 --> 00:39:36,252
Tell me, what did my dad
and you used to do again?

655
00:39:37,652 --> 00:39:38,884
We used to challenge the
rest of the street kids

656
00:39:38,886 --> 00:39:40,920
to good old bare-knuckle fights.

657
00:39:40,922 --> 00:39:41,757
Why?

658
00:39:42,658 --> 00:39:43,991
Because it's fun.

659
00:39:43,993 --> 00:39:46,493
Two brothers against the
rest of the street kids?

660
00:39:46,495 --> 00:39:49,929
It's exciting, created
a bond between us.

661
00:39:49,931 --> 00:39:51,732
That's something your
generation doesn't really have.

662
00:39:51,734 --> 00:39:54,333
Your generation doesn't
do anything in reality.

663
00:39:54,335 --> 00:39:55,772
I get that, but

664
00:39:56,906 --> 00:39:58,406
at least my generation has...

665
00:39:58,408 --> 00:39:59,741
Lack of the real world.

666
00:40:00,676 --> 00:40:02,676
Look, technology is amazing.

667
00:40:02,678 --> 00:40:05,511
The ability to text and
video chat with your friends

668
00:40:05,513 --> 00:40:07,848
is great, but your
generation shouldn't just do

669
00:40:07,850 --> 00:40:10,350
sports in school
because it's a class.

670
00:40:10,352 --> 00:40:11,851
Now I'm not saying
fighting is cool.

671
00:40:11,853 --> 00:40:13,853
Thank you, or
everything that we did

672
00:40:13,855 --> 00:40:15,522
growing up was all good.

673
00:40:15,524 --> 00:40:18,357
But it created real-life
experiences like no other.

674
00:40:18,359 --> 00:40:21,161
To physically hit a ball
or tackle your friends

675
00:40:21,163 --> 00:40:22,165
in a football game?

676
00:40:23,533 --> 00:40:26,699
Couple of fights here and
there, it's real life.

677
00:40:26,701 --> 00:40:27,970
You piece of shit, rat.

678
00:40:30,372 --> 00:40:33,041
We should just do him now,
never mind the cleaner.

679
00:40:34,944 --> 00:40:36,379
I hate rats.

680
00:40:37,513 --> 00:40:39,212
And you're gonna
tell us where you hid

681
00:40:39,214 --> 00:40:41,449
the payoff money
the feds gave you.

682
00:40:41,451 --> 00:40:42,218
Huh?

683
00:40:43,285 --> 00:40:46,055
What did you promise the feds?

684
00:40:47,357 --> 00:40:48,788
We vouched for you.

685
00:40:48,790 --> 00:40:51,958
We may have to go on
the lam because of you!

686
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:55,862
How could you rat us out, huh?

687
00:40:55,864 --> 00:40:58,533
Why would you rat us out?

688
00:40:59,701 --> 00:41:01,234
All right, look at
all this delicious food.

689
00:41:01,236 --> 00:41:02,669
Thank you, ladies.

690
00:41:02,671 --> 00:41:03,837
Dylan, wanna say grace?

691
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:04,674
Sure.

692
00:41:07,743 --> 00:41:09,011
Dear God, uh,

693
00:41:10,312 --> 00:41:11,745
thank you for all of
us for being here.

694
00:41:11,747 --> 00:41:13,379
Please nourish this
food to our bodies

695
00:41:13,381 --> 00:41:15,214
and let's have a
good day tomorrow.

696
00:41:15,216 --> 00:41:16,650
- Amen.
- Amen.

697
00:41:16,652 --> 00:41:19,822
Hey, Dylan, did you tell
Uncle Brody about your new job?

698
00:41:20,821 --> 00:41:22,589
You should tell him, Dylan.

699
00:41:22,591 --> 00:41:24,924
It's awesome, and
very impressive.

700
00:41:24,926 --> 00:41:25,761
Yeah?

701
00:41:27,196 --> 00:41:29,429
I have a online channel
where I post videos

702
00:41:29,431 --> 00:41:31,000
and make a little bit of money.

703
00:41:31,834 --> 00:41:33,600
Oh, what kinda videos?

704
00:41:33,602 --> 00:41:36,002
Just stuff that's
important to me.

705
00:41:36,004 --> 00:41:38,437
Yeah, he has a whole
channel where he just talks

706
00:41:38,439 --> 00:41:40,742
about rapping, movies and music.

707
00:41:42,078 --> 00:41:43,609
That's kinda why I
always have my phone on me.

708
00:41:43,611 --> 00:41:44,879
While you think I'm texting,

709
00:41:44,881 --> 00:41:47,013
I'm actually getting
ideas for my show.

710
00:41:47,015 --> 00:41:48,614
And you get paid?

711
00:41:48,616 --> 00:41:51,250
Yes, sir, pretty good, too.

712
00:41:51,252 --> 00:41:54,420
Last month, he made $15,000.

713
00:41:54,422 --> 00:41:55,955
Wow.

714
00:41:55,957 --> 00:41:58,725
That's like serious nest
egg, I mean, that's great.

715
00:41:58,727 --> 00:42:01,395
And you know, his dad takes
the money, puts it in savings

716
00:42:01,397 --> 00:42:04,198
so he can get it when
he graduates college?

717
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:07,366
My brother never mentioned
your little side business.

718
00:42:07,368 --> 00:42:08,935
I'm proud of you.

719
00:42:08,937 --> 00:42:11,440
Yeah, not all
millennials are lazy.

720
00:42:12,774 --> 00:42:14,808
Still should get out
and play sports too.

721
00:42:14,810 --> 00:42:16,810
Enjoy being a kid.

722
00:42:16,812 --> 00:42:19,980
Okay, so tomorrow, I'm
gonna take Naomi and Deana,

723
00:42:19,982 --> 00:42:21,614
and we're gonna go to the lake.

724
00:42:21,616 --> 00:42:23,984
And I think that
maybe you and Dylan

725
00:42:23,986 --> 00:42:26,422
should do some, bonding.

726
00:42:28,323 --> 00:42:30,824
Aw, honey, I'm on
call all day tomorrow.

727
00:42:30,826 --> 00:42:32,658
I gave Jaeckel the day off.

728
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:34,161
Oh.

729
00:42:34,163 --> 00:42:36,666
Can I still hang out with
you anyways, Uncle Brody?

730
00:42:38,132 --> 00:42:41,100
Sure, you can help me fill
the generators with gasoline.

731
00:42:41,102 --> 00:42:42,969
Then maybe we can
take the boat out.

732
00:42:42,971 --> 00:42:43,805
Oh.

733
00:42:46,509 --> 00:42:49,178
You should do a
segment about it.

734
00:42:50,011 --> 00:42:51,645
Can I be the topic?

735
00:42:51,647 --> 00:42:53,245
Sure.

736
00:42:53,247 --> 00:42:54,448
We can also get Dad involved

737
00:42:54,450 --> 00:42:56,283
and you guys talk about
the good old days.

738
00:42:57,118 --> 00:42:57,919
Now you're talking.

739
00:42:58,953 --> 00:43:00,156
15,000?

740
00:43:01,357 --> 00:43:02,355
Yeah.

741
00:43:02,357 --> 00:43:03,690
Cheers, cheers to that.

742
00:43:03,692 --> 00:43:06,326
Why would you rat us out?

743
00:43:08,497 --> 00:43:10,663
Your father was a
rat too, wasn't he?

744
00:43:10,665 --> 00:43:12,834
Huh, he was on the
witness protection.

745
00:43:14,002 --> 00:43:15,870
I gotta go back and
talk to Jimmy Little.

746
00:43:15,872 --> 00:43:18,203
You're gonna tell us right
now what the feds did!

747
00:43:18,205 --> 00:43:19,808
You're gonna tell us right now!

748
00:43:21,210 --> 00:43:22,612
I love you guys.

749
00:43:23,478 --> 00:43:24,810
I'm not a rat.

750
00:43:24,812 --> 00:43:26,279
You're a rat.

751
00:43:26,281 --> 00:43:28,882
You are a rat, and Jimmy
Little told me to take care

752
00:43:28,884 --> 00:43:31,317
of you now, and I am
taking care of you now.

753
00:43:31,319 --> 00:43:33,722
You are a rat, tell
us where the money is!

754
00:44:09,924 --> 00:44:10,991
Brody?

755
00:44:14,763 --> 00:44:15,565
Jaeckel?

756
00:44:21,502 --> 00:44:22,669
Hello?

757
00:44:40,788 --> 00:44:42,522
Camp Taghkanic Lake State
Park and Campground,

758
00:44:42,524 --> 00:44:43,593
how can I help you?

759
00:44:48,964 --> 00:44:50,732
No, great, thank you.

760
00:44:51,634 --> 00:44:52,632
All right.

761
00:45:05,047 --> 00:45:07,948
I'm gonna grab
the marshmallows.

762
00:45:07,950 --> 00:45:08,748
Thank you.

763
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:09,584
Yeah.

764
00:45:12,154 --> 00:45:14,321
- Oh, I love s'mores.
- Who wants to roast?

765
00:45:14,323 --> 00:45:16,388
Roasting here?

766
00:45:16,390 --> 00:45:17,924
I think I need
to put my pants on.

767
00:45:17,926 --> 00:45:18,824
Here.

768
00:45:18,826 --> 00:45:20,893
Maybe this'll warm us up.

769
00:45:20,895 --> 00:45:23,496
Be better if it was coffee.

770
00:45:23,498 --> 00:45:24,332
Anyone?

771
00:45:28,937 --> 00:45:30,170
Looks like you and me, babe.

772
00:45:30,172 --> 00:45:32,337
Yeah, and a whole
group of friends.

773
00:45:32,339 --> 00:45:33,843

Oh no, what are you
gonna sing, Archie?

778
00:45:54,663 --> 00:45:57,667
Something everyone
can join in on.

779
00:45:58,834 --> 00:46:00,268
Oh please,
no Kumbaya, no Kumbaya.

780
00:46:01,870 --> 00:46:03,839
Hey, it's campfire
karaoke Archie.

781
00:46:06,274 --> 00:46:08,107
You think I can't do it.

782
00:46:08,109 --> 00:46:10,342
I did not say.

783
00:46:10,344 --> 00:46:11,214
I take the Fifth.

784
00:46:12,346 --> 00:46:14,214
Gather round, friends.

785
00:46:14,216 --> 00:46:18,719
Witness me proving
Zoe wrong yet again.

786
00:46:30,131 --> 00:46:31,399
Should I take over?

787
00:46:32,301 --> 00:46:33,469
Yes.

788
00:46:34,636 --> 00:46:36,172
I think Archie
has stage fright.

789
00:46:37,038 --> 00:46:38,237
Me?

790
00:46:38,239 --> 00:46:39,075
Never.

791
00:46:40,207 --> 00:46:41,076
You'll like this.

Hm-mm, come on.

800
00:47:20,114 --> 00:47:23,917
Let's go, I'm gonna
take a quick shower.

801
00:47:23,919 --> 00:47:25,585
Can you pack up the car?

802
00:47:25,587 --> 00:47:27,120
Uh-huh.

803
00:47:27,122 --> 00:47:29,589
I would love to make my
sister's engagement party.

804
00:47:29,591 --> 00:47:32,094
Amber, I will get you
home in time, relax.

805
00:47:33,462 --> 00:47:35,594
Come here for a minute.

806
00:47:35,596 --> 00:47:36,431
No.

807
00:47:37,299 --> 00:47:38,297
No.

808
00:49:21,035 --> 00:49:24,703
Come on, Steve, I
wanna get to the reunion.

809
00:49:24,705 --> 00:49:27,073
You are still in the same
spot that I left you in.

810
00:49:27,075 --> 00:49:28,408
I was waiting for you.

811
00:49:28,410 --> 00:49:30,409
Come on, babe, you promised.

812
00:49:30,411 --> 00:49:32,078
Hey, here, come
here, hey hey hey.

813
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:35,515
Just for a minute, just
for a minute, okay.

814
00:49:35,517 --> 00:49:38,020
No, Timmy, twice
is fine for now.

815
00:49:39,553 --> 00:49:40,486
One more round.

816
00:49:40,488 --> 00:49:42,187
You said that the first time.

817
00:49:42,189 --> 00:49:43,357
Okay.

818
00:49:43,359 --> 00:49:44,324
You said after a
kiss, we're headed back.

819
00:49:44,326 --> 00:49:45,158
Okay.

820
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:46,592
And then we kissed.

821
00:49:46,594 --> 00:49:48,362
And then you wanted
to fool around.

822
00:49:48,364 --> 00:49:49,596
So we fooled around.

823
00:49:49,598 --> 00:49:52,165
Yeah, just for a
minute, come here.

824
00:49:52,167 --> 00:49:53,399
Come here.

825
00:49:53,401 --> 00:49:54,567
And then you said,
babe, let's make love,

826
00:49:54,569 --> 00:49:55,771
so then we made love.

827
00:49:57,071 --> 00:49:58,906
But what other guy
has Miss February

828
00:49:58,908 --> 00:50:01,841
as his girlfriend to make
love to all the time?

829
00:50:01,843 --> 00:50:05,880
You, Mister,
are truly amazing.

830
00:50:14,254 --> 00:50:16,589
No, we're going, we are going.

831
00:50:16,591 --> 00:50:20,692
I am so damn.

832
00:50:34,375 --> 00:50:35,641
I hear, I agree.

833
00:51:11,279 --> 00:51:13,181
Come to me, run, run!

834
00:52:01,397 --> 00:52:02,698
Help, help me.

835
00:52:05,567 --> 00:52:06,402
Hello?

836
00:52:23,218 --> 00:52:25,817
What are you singing?

837
00:52:25,819 --> 00:52:27,987
Oh no, come on.

838
00:52:27,989 --> 00:52:30,092
This isn't a St.
Matthias retreat.

839
00:52:31,426 --> 00:52:33,558
Sing something different.

840
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:36,663
No wonder why our group gets
smaller and smaller each year.

841
00:52:36,665 --> 00:52:38,196
That wasn't fair.

842
00:52:38,198 --> 00:52:40,199
All right, you
didn't like that one?

843
00:52:40,201 --> 00:52:41,100
Understatement.

844
00:52:41,102 --> 00:52:42,870
Okay, how about this one?

00:52:46,674 --> 00:52:51,576

Hey, you're burning them.

851
00:53:11,132 --> 00:53:15,600
Miles, you can't even roast,
what's wrong with you?

852
00:53:15,602 --> 00:53:16,471
That bush.

853
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:19,371
It's getting closer.

854
00:53:19,373 --> 00:53:22,275
Screw the bush, does
anyone have signal.

855
00:53:22,277 --> 00:53:23,944
I'm pretty wasted.

856
00:53:28,049 --> 00:53:29,248
Are you stoned?

857
00:53:29,250 --> 00:53:31,152
What did you smoke
with Archie?

858
00:53:32,321 --> 00:53:33,219
I might
be a little wasted.

859
00:53:33,221 --> 00:53:35,422
Yeah, you think?

860
00:54:54,468 --> 00:54:55,903
I wonder what's down there.

861
00:54:57,571 --> 00:55:00,873
What's up, everybody, you're
back here with Dylan T.

862
00:55:00,875 --> 00:55:02,375
And we're here to
check out this tunnel.

863
00:55:02,377 --> 00:55:04,176
Lotta things I wanna
do here this summer,

864
00:55:04,178 --> 00:55:06,078
but the first thing
we're gonna do

865
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:07,580
is go on a little adventure.

866
00:55:07,582 --> 00:55:09,915
Come along with me, and
we'll discover it together.

867
00:55:09,917 --> 00:55:11,917
Let me know in the comments
where you think this will end

868
00:55:11,919 --> 00:55:14,087
or you think if
I'll find anything.

869
00:55:14,089 --> 00:55:15,922
Can't read all your comments
right now, but I will

870
00:55:15,924 --> 00:55:19,161
make sure that I respond to
each and every one of you.

871
00:55:20,428 --> 00:55:22,594
Kinda smells bad,
kinda smells like shit.

872
00:55:22,596 --> 00:55:24,531
Smells like rotting meat
or something like that.

873
00:55:24,533 --> 00:55:28,100
Apparently, this used to be an
old mine, a goldmine at that.

874
00:55:37,078 --> 00:55:39,545
Maxine told me to talk to
you about unpacking your mess.

875
00:55:39,547 --> 00:55:41,880
She stated, oh, I'm sorry, I
didn't mean to make you jump.

876
00:55:41,882 --> 00:55:43,716
That's okay.

877
00:55:43,718 --> 00:55:45,350
I was thinking just that.

878
00:55:45,352 --> 00:55:46,187
What's up?

879
00:55:47,622 --> 00:55:49,087
I double checked on all
of our current occupancies,

880
00:55:49,089 --> 00:55:50,455
and we don't have
anybody registered

881
00:55:50,457 --> 00:55:52,792
for Plot 43 at the lake,
we don't have anybody

882
00:55:52,794 --> 00:55:54,928
staying on this side of
the lake at all, actually,

883
00:55:54,930 --> 00:55:57,362
but we have the reunion
group down by the canyon,

884
00:55:57,364 --> 00:55:59,966
we have DiStefanos in Cabin
Four, and then we have

885
00:55:59,968 --> 00:56:01,801
the bikers retreat
by Haven Ridge

886
00:56:01,803 --> 00:56:03,368
as well as Charlie
over by the pond.

887
00:56:03,370 --> 00:56:04,804
Okay, okay, I get it.

888
00:56:04,806 --> 00:56:06,105
Has anyone needed anything
since they checked in?

889
00:56:06,107 --> 00:56:07,741
Other than the DiStefanos?

890
00:56:07,743 --> 00:56:09,574
No, everybody's been
great, no issues.

891
00:56:09,576 --> 00:56:11,643
It's been pretty much dead.

892
00:56:11,645 --> 00:56:12,446
Great.

893
00:56:13,647 --> 00:56:17,415
Also, Jaeckel's
off today, right?

894
00:56:17,417 --> 00:56:18,984
Yes, I believe he and his wife

895
00:56:18,986 --> 00:56:20,453
are looking at some
property today.

896
00:56:20,455 --> 00:56:22,154
That's what I
remember him saying.

897
00:56:22,156 --> 00:56:24,323
His wife has called at
least three times today.

898
00:56:24,325 --> 00:56:27,226
She said that he didn't
come home last night.

899
00:56:27,228 --> 00:56:28,062
Really?

900
00:56:29,497 --> 00:56:30,996
Maybe he fell asleep at the
stables, lost track of time.

901
00:56:30,998 --> 00:56:32,998
I'll take a look in a bit.

902
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:33,835
Dylan?

903
00:56:41,076 --> 00:56:43,509
All right, I'll check back
in with you here in a few.

904
00:56:52,986 --> 00:56:54,487
Dylan?

905
00:56:54,489 --> 00:56:55,687
Coming.

906
00:56:55,689 --> 00:56:56,855
You really
have to clean these up.

907
00:56:56,857 --> 00:56:57,692
Geez.

908
00:57:00,094 --> 00:57:00,960
Where were
you all this time?

909
00:57:00,962 --> 00:57:02,428
I was in the basement.

910
00:57:02,430 --> 00:57:04,129
Did you know that there
are tunnels under here?

911
00:57:04,131 --> 00:57:05,499
Tunnels? No.

912
00:57:06,835 --> 00:57:07,766
What's with the bat?

913
00:57:07,768 --> 00:57:09,534
Hey, stay outta the tunnels.

914
00:57:09,536 --> 00:57:11,337
I'm not sure if they're safe.

915
00:57:11,339 --> 00:57:13,505
That's my fall project,
and only if they're safe

916
00:57:13,507 --> 00:57:14,873
are we allowed to
get back in there.

917
00:57:14,875 --> 00:57:16,208
They seem pretty safe.

918
00:57:16,210 --> 00:57:17,444
I mean, they smell really bad,

919
00:57:17,446 --> 00:57:18,978
but I'm pretty sure
that they're safe.

920
00:57:18,980 --> 00:57:20,179
I think the one under here
actually leads to the lake.

921
00:57:20,181 --> 00:57:22,380
Hey, hey, hey, stay
outta the tunnels.

922
00:57:22,382 --> 00:57:23,649
This is my last warning, kid.

923
00:57:23,651 --> 00:57:25,317
I don't think they're safe.

924
00:57:25,319 --> 00:57:26,153
Yes, sir.

925
00:57:27,355 --> 00:57:29,388
All right, now, do me a favor.

926
00:57:29,390 --> 00:57:31,056
Head down to the stables,
see if Jaeckel's there.

927
00:57:31,058 --> 00:57:32,826
If he is, wake him up,

928
00:57:32,828 --> 00:57:34,794
tell him to call his
wife and go home.

929
00:57:34,796 --> 00:57:35,897
- Okay.
- Thanks.

930
00:57:37,397 --> 00:57:39,163
Hey, checked your
channel out, it's nice.

931
00:57:39,165 --> 00:57:40,732
Did you know that I sing too?

932
00:57:40,734 --> 00:57:41,569
Hmm.

933
00:57:42,736 --> 00:57:44,171
Can we go on the boat later?

934
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:46,973
Oh, yes.

935
00:57:46,975 --> 00:57:49,074
I have to fill the
generators first, then we go.

936
00:57:49,076 --> 00:57:49,911
Okay.

937
00:57:53,848 --> 00:57:55,748
What time you closing up?

938
00:57:55,750 --> 00:57:58,016
Would about now, but with
the exterminator being here,

939
00:57:58,018 --> 00:57:59,254
I'll be here a while.

940
00:58:19,940 --> 00:58:21,841
Who are you?

941
00:58:21,843 --> 00:58:24,210
I hear you got
a rodent problem.

942
00:58:24,212 --> 00:58:25,844
Rodent?

943
00:58:25,846 --> 00:58:27,245
Oh yeah, you're
the guy that's here

944
00:58:27,247 --> 00:58:28,614
to take care of the rat.

945
00:58:28,616 --> 00:58:30,850
Hey, nice play on words.

946
00:58:30,852 --> 00:58:33,286
Well, if there's a rat
that needs to go away,

947
00:58:33,288 --> 00:58:34,786
I'm your guy.

948
00:58:34,788 --> 00:58:37,191
Well, we got him isolated
in the back, come on in.

949
00:58:43,797 --> 00:58:45,866
Hey, Marco, he's here!

950
00:58:51,138 --> 00:58:52,641
Who are you, you're not MoMo.

951
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:55,141
I don't know no MoMo.

952
00:58:55,143 --> 00:58:57,646
They sent me, Lenny,
Lenny Cusumano.

953
00:58:58,913 --> 00:59:01,114
Where you from,
Lenny Cusumano?

954
00:59:01,116 --> 00:59:03,082
Originally, or
where I live now?

955
00:59:03,084 --> 00:59:04,984
No, you sound like
you're from back east.

956
00:59:04,986 --> 00:59:06,585
You from Jersey?

957
00:59:06,587 --> 00:59:07,987
I ain't no Jersey boy.

958
00:59:07,989 --> 00:59:09,324
New York, Queens.

959
00:59:10,424 --> 00:59:11,489
Cusumano?

960
00:59:11,491 --> 00:59:12,491
Cusumano.

961
00:59:12,493 --> 00:59:13,792
Cusumano from Flushing?

962
00:59:13,794 --> 00:59:15,330
No, Cusumano from Whitestone.

963
00:59:16,431 --> 00:59:17,330
Whitestone.

964
00:59:17,332 --> 00:59:19,098
Whitestone, Cusumano.

965
00:59:19,100 --> 00:59:20,768
Yeah, I heard
that name before.

966
00:59:21,969 --> 00:59:24,170
Cusumano, used to
run the coffee shop

967
00:59:24,172 --> 00:59:25,404
over at the Cross Island?

968
00:59:25,406 --> 00:59:26,839
You mean Jackie's Place?

969
00:59:26,841 --> 00:59:28,074
Yeah.

970
00:59:28,076 --> 00:59:30,676
Oh, he's a nice
guy, how is Jackie?

971
00:59:30,678 --> 00:59:32,243
I don't know no Jackie.

972
00:59:32,245 --> 00:59:35,681
No coffee, Cusumano, I ran
the florist on 14th Avenue

973
00:59:35,683 --> 00:59:38,451
and the pizza place
over on Parsons.

974
00:59:38,453 --> 00:59:39,454
The shopping center.

975
00:59:40,321 --> 00:59:42,821
Cusumano, hey listen, fellas,

976
00:59:42,823 --> 00:59:44,524
I got a busy day ahead
of me, all right,

977
00:59:44,526 --> 00:59:45,924
lotta calls to make.

978
00:59:45,926 --> 00:59:48,159
Okay, lotta problems out here.

979
00:59:48,161 --> 00:59:50,862
So, let's start with yours.

980
00:59:50,864 --> 00:59:53,100
Where is this, um, rat?

981
00:59:53,968 --> 00:59:55,868
The rat is in the back.

982
00:59:55,870 --> 00:59:57,036
The rat's in the back?

983
00:59:57,038 --> 00:59:59,138
Yeah, we were gonna
do it ourselves,

984
00:59:59,140 --> 01:00:01,975
but Richie from Inglewood
said to call MoMo.

985
01:00:01,977 --> 01:00:04,544
Yeah, we prepped
everything and all.

986
01:00:04,546 --> 01:00:05,377
You prepped the stuff?

987
01:00:05,379 --> 01:00:06,213
Yeah.

988
01:00:07,314 --> 01:00:08,880
Well, let me
tell you something.

989
01:00:08,882 --> 01:00:11,285
Rats, they can be tricky.

990
01:00:12,152 --> 01:00:13,888
They're actually smart bastards.

991
01:00:14,790 --> 01:00:16,154
Not this one.

992
01:00:18,292 --> 01:00:20,960
Stupid ass walked
right into a trap,

993
01:00:20,962 --> 01:00:23,228
never even saw it coming.

994
01:00:42,683 --> 01:00:43,484
Wow.

995
01:00:44,919 --> 01:00:48,087
Yous guys really know
how to camp, huh?

996
01:00:51,259 --> 01:00:52,427
How you doing?

997
01:00:57,832 --> 01:01:00,065
Just checking for droppings.

998
01:01:31,466 --> 01:01:32,734
So this is, uh,

999
01:01:34,402 --> 01:01:37,139
where you first learned
about the rat, huh?

1000
01:01:41,575 --> 01:01:43,908
This where you heard
the scratching?

1001
01:01:43,910 --> 01:01:46,444
No, no, that was
down in the basement.

1002
01:01:46,446 --> 01:01:47,314
Oh the basement.

1003
01:01:48,716 --> 01:01:49,649
Oh.

1004
01:01:49,651 --> 01:01:50,783
Sounded like a raccoon.

1005
01:01:50,785 --> 01:01:52,150
It was a bear.

1006
01:01:52,152 --> 01:01:53,317
It wasn't a bear.

1007
01:01:53,319 --> 01:01:55,154
Either way it's a simple job.

1008
01:01:55,156 --> 01:01:57,792
Listen, I'll go out in the
truck and get my tools and

1009
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:00,592
be on my way.

1010
01:02:00,594 --> 01:02:01,627
What do you need
your tools for?

1011
01:02:01,629 --> 01:02:02,964
We got everything laid out.

1012
01:02:06,234 --> 01:02:08,000
Those are for amateurs.

1013
01:02:08,002 --> 01:02:09,301
Yeah, no, I got pro stuff,

1014
01:02:09,303 --> 01:02:12,105
you know, neck snappers,

1015
01:02:12,107 --> 01:02:16,107
poison, sticky pads.

1016
01:02:16,109 --> 01:02:17,312
Sometimes peanut butter.

1017
01:02:18,678 --> 01:02:20,312
Yeah.

1018
01:02:20,314 --> 01:02:23,651
Uh, is this okay to
take care of him here?

1019
01:02:24,984 --> 01:02:27,487
I don't see why not,
once I get started.

1020
01:02:27,489 --> 01:02:28,323
It'll do.

1021
01:02:29,991 --> 01:02:31,024
Yeah.

1022
01:02:31,026 --> 01:02:31,859
Hey, Lenny?

1023
01:02:33,426 --> 01:02:34,525
I don't wanna stop on your toes

1024
01:02:34,527 --> 01:02:36,761
or tell you how to do your job,

1025
01:02:36,763 --> 01:02:37,598
but, uh,

1026
01:02:39,533 --> 01:02:40,801
he's meant a lot to us.

1027
01:02:42,035 --> 01:02:44,004
You know, I don't
wanna see him suffer.

1028
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:47,440
He won't.

1029
01:02:47,442 --> 01:02:48,476
I'll make it quick.

1030
01:02:49,343 --> 01:02:51,476
I'm part of the Humane Society.

1031
01:02:51,478 --> 01:02:53,011
Sticker's on my truck.

1032
01:02:53,013 --> 01:02:56,151
All right, I'll go get my tools
and start in the basement.

1033
01:02:57,685 --> 01:02:59,187
What the hell does that mean?

1034
01:03:00,888 --> 01:03:02,620
Peanut butter?

1035
01:03:02,622 --> 01:03:04,656
Hey, how the hell did he know

1036
01:03:04,658 --> 01:03:06,527
about the scratching
in the basement?

1037
01:03:07,694 --> 01:03:09,027
I don't know, how'd he
know about the raccoon

1038
01:03:09,029 --> 01:03:11,362
and the rat and all that stuff?

1039
01:03:11,364 --> 01:03:13,332
It's a freaking bear.

1040
01:03:13,334 --> 01:03:15,236
What the hell did
I get myself into?

1041
01:03:23,044 --> 01:03:25,243
Just get this job done.

1042
01:03:30,317 --> 01:03:32,183
He's the fricking
exterminator.

1043
01:03:32,185 --> 01:03:34,652
You mean he's
the exterminator?

1044
01:03:34,654 --> 01:03:36,022
He's not the cleaner?

1045
01:03:36,024 --> 01:03:37,422
What happened?

1046
01:03:37,424 --> 01:03:39,692
Cusumano, he's the
fricking exterminator.

1047
01:03:39,694 --> 01:03:41,092
He's not the cleaner.

1048
01:03:41,094 --> 01:03:43,529
Oh, for the scratching
problem, good.

1049
01:03:43,531 --> 01:03:46,766
He made us, he knows what
we're gonna do to Benny!

1050
01:03:46,768 --> 01:03:48,333
Shut up, you idiot!

1051
01:03:48,335 --> 01:03:50,201
I'm gonna tell you what to do.

1052
01:03:50,203 --> 01:03:51,370
You're gonna go down
in the basement,

1053
01:03:51,372 --> 01:03:52,837
you're gonna wait for him.

1054
01:03:52,839 --> 01:03:55,007
When he comes down and he
signs off that he's finished,

1055
01:03:55,009 --> 01:03:56,741
you're gonna whack
him, and we'll bury him

1056
01:03:56,743 --> 01:03:58,109
and Benny in the basement.

1057
01:03:58,111 --> 01:03:59,513
Now get the hell outta here!

1058
01:04:00,948 --> 01:04:02,114
Done.

1059
01:04:02,116 --> 01:04:03,084
All right.

1060
01:04:04,685 --> 01:04:05,683
Yeah.

1061
01:04:05,685 --> 01:04:07,122
Just get the job done.

1062
01:04:09,890 --> 01:04:11,125
Get in, get out.

1063
01:04:12,459 --> 01:04:16,462
You didn't see nothing.

1064
01:04:18,799 --> 01:04:20,468
That's what we need.

1065
01:04:23,370 --> 01:04:25,870
I didn't see nothing.

1066
01:04:25,872 --> 01:04:27,540
I didn't see nothing.

1067
01:04:45,893 --> 01:04:48,627
Just do this job
and get outta here.

1068
01:04:48,629 --> 01:04:49,663
I didn't see nothing.

1069
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:55,567
Where you at, Mr. Rat, huh?

1070
01:04:55,569 --> 01:04:57,005
Come on out.

1071
01:04:58,672 --> 01:05:00,473
Come out, come out
wherever you are.

1072
01:05:00,475 --> 01:05:04,409
Come to Uncle Lenny, I got
some rat drink for you.

1073
01:05:04,411 --> 01:05:06,511
You want some rat drink?

1074
01:05:06,513 --> 01:05:07,348
Come on.

1075
01:05:08,649 --> 01:05:10,482
Where you at?

1076
01:05:10,484 --> 01:05:14,520
I smell your stinking
little ass, you little rat.

1077
01:05:16,256 --> 01:05:18,357
Where is that little
fella that's keeping up

1078
01:05:18,359 --> 01:05:20,525
those gangsters at night, huh?

1079
01:05:20,527 --> 01:05:24,029
Ooh, I can't sleep, I hear
some scratching sounds.

1080
01:05:26,533 --> 01:05:28,802
Yeah, like big
scratching sounds.

1081
01:05:30,004 --> 01:05:31,469
Maybe it's a raccoon.

1082
01:05:31,471 --> 01:05:34,440
Yeah, stinking raccoon, what
do you know, you goomba?

1083
01:05:34,442 --> 01:05:35,373
You ain't no professional.

1084
01:05:35,375 --> 01:05:38,377
Oh, I got you.

1085
01:05:38,379 --> 01:05:41,714
There you are, let me
get a better look at you.

1086
01:05:41,716 --> 01:05:42,549
Oh ho.

1087
01:05:43,884 --> 01:05:45,551
There we are.

1088
01:05:45,553 --> 01:05:46,688
Look at that.

1089
01:05:48,989 --> 01:05:49,823
Oh.

1090
01:05:51,158 --> 01:05:53,161
Come get some rat drink, fella.

1091
01:05:54,194 --> 01:05:57,062
Get Lenny's
proprietary rat drink.

1092
01:05:57,064 --> 01:05:59,134
You're gonna love
the way it tastes.

1093
01:06:00,567 --> 01:06:03,171
What's the matter, Lenny's rat
drink too cold for you, huh?

1094
01:06:05,406 --> 01:06:07,542
Oh that is a big freaking claw.

1095
01:06:13,513 --> 01:06:16,382
That's a big freaking mouse.

1096
01:06:16,384 --> 01:06:17,752
You are a big freaking rat.

1097
01:06:21,756 --> 01:06:22,589
Back.

1098
01:06:24,091 --> 01:06:25,926
Big freaking rat, run!

1099
01:06:27,094 --> 01:06:28,993
I want you to give me
one good reason, Benny.

1100
01:06:28,995 --> 01:06:30,261
Hit him, man, hit him!

1101
01:06:30,263 --> 01:06:31,663
Hit him!

1102
01:06:31,665 --> 01:06:33,098
One reason why I
shouldn't cap you right now.

1103
01:06:33,100 --> 01:06:34,734
Talk to him, Benny, talk.

1104
01:06:34,736 --> 01:06:38,373
Big freaking rat,
big freaking rat.

1105
01:06:39,774 --> 01:06:41,272
What's wrong with him?

1106
01:06:41,274 --> 01:06:44,109
Oh, you've got a rat
problem, all right.

1107
01:06:44,111 --> 01:06:45,109
I knew it.

1108
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:47,913
No, not that, this rat!

1109
01:06:50,951 --> 01:06:53,286
We're gonna need a bigger trap.

1110
01:06:53,288 --> 01:06:54,518
Is that the coon?

1111
01:06:54,520 --> 01:06:56,087
That's no freaking raccoon!

1112
01:06:56,089 --> 01:06:57,022
It ain't a bear!

1113
01:06:57,024 --> 01:06:58,393
It's a big freaking.

1114
01:07:10,971 --> 01:07:11,805
Paulie.

1115
01:07:28,321 --> 01:07:29,223
Mmm, God.

1116
01:07:34,161 --> 01:07:37,228
I love girl time,
when it's just us.

1117
01:07:37,230 --> 01:07:40,234
Mm, girl time is the best.

1118
01:07:42,169 --> 01:07:45,971
I get to have a little
bit of it with my mom, but

1119
01:07:45,973 --> 01:07:49,341
she's just been
really busy, you know,

1120
01:07:49,343 --> 01:07:52,279
taking Nana to her chemo
treatments and all.

1121
01:07:53,480 --> 01:07:55,748
It's okay, Nana's
gonna be fine.

1122
01:07:55,750 --> 01:07:59,587
She's beat it once, and she's
gonna kick its ass again.

1123
01:08:01,122 --> 01:08:01,955
Yeah.

1124
01:08:03,357 --> 01:08:07,361
Nana is the strongest woman
I've ever met, even at 81.

1125
01:08:08,529 --> 01:08:11,529
And yeah, yeah, she
will kick cancer's ass.

1126
01:08:11,531 --> 01:08:13,433
- Mm-hmm.
- Because Nana don't play.

1127
01:08:14,634 --> 01:08:15,770
Yeah, I love that.

1128
01:08:19,172 --> 01:08:20,938
Oh my gosh.

1129
01:08:20,940 --> 01:08:23,008
Dylan, what are you doing
filming us like a creep?

1130
01:08:23,010 --> 01:08:25,213
I am adding you
both to the Glory Days

1131
01:08:26,046 --> 01:08:27,679
of Summer of Dylan T.

1132
01:08:27,681 --> 01:08:30,050
You're such a perv
with that camera.

1133
01:08:32,653 --> 01:08:34,719
Aren't you supposed to be
working with your uncle?

1134
01:08:34,721 --> 01:08:36,187
I am.

1135
01:08:36,189 --> 01:08:38,557
He sent me down to the
stables to wake up Jaeckel.

1136
01:08:39,894 --> 01:08:41,293
His wife probably called.

1137
01:08:41,295 --> 01:08:43,460
Yes, you need to
go to the stables,

1138
01:08:43,462 --> 01:08:44,998
they're down the hill that way.

1139
01:08:46,533 --> 01:08:50,334
Or, should I call your
uncle now, mm-hmm.

1140
01:08:50,336 --> 01:08:51,238
Oh ho ho.

1141
01:08:52,973 --> 01:08:54,071
Should I call your uncle now?

1142
01:08:54,073 --> 01:08:55,641
That was good, that was good.

1143
01:08:55,643 --> 01:08:58,008
You know what I
really wanted to say?

1144
01:08:58,010 --> 01:09:01,847
Listen, you little perv, I'm
gonna kick your freaking ass.

1145
01:09:04,085 --> 01:09:06,718
Oh, you guys are
gonna call me a pervert?

1146
01:09:06,720 --> 01:09:09,087
Ah, I'm gonna talk
to your uncle.

1147
01:09:09,089 --> 01:09:12,391
Ah, I'm just getting
footage for the show.

1148
01:09:12,393 --> 01:09:14,927
I don't know why everyone
gets mad at me for doing that.

1149
01:09:14,929 --> 01:09:16,861
It's just snippets
here, snippets there.

1150
01:09:19,099 --> 01:09:20,900
Camp Taghkanic Lake
State Park and Campground,

1151
01:09:20,902 --> 01:09:21,903
how can I help you?

1152
01:09:23,069 --> 01:09:25,536
Oh, Janice, it's good
to hear from you again.

1153
01:09:25,538 --> 01:09:27,539
Oh, yeah, no problem, it
gets really confusing.

1154
01:09:27,541 --> 01:09:30,075
Okay, so if you keep
going down, you'll see

1155
01:09:30,077 --> 01:09:31,677
a small gas station
on your right,

1156
01:09:31,679 --> 01:09:34,079
I think it's Old
Mill and Canyon Road.

1157
01:09:34,081 --> 01:09:36,080
Are you ever gonna
marry my uncle?

1158
01:09:36,082 --> 01:09:38,383
He really loves you, that's all.

1159
01:09:38,385 --> 01:09:41,119
I can't even, you're
like, you know what,

1160
01:09:41,121 --> 01:09:44,789
you are so digging right now
I'm gonna call you Shovels.

1161
01:09:45,960 --> 01:09:47,028
Shovels, good.

1162
01:10:03,577 --> 01:10:06,114
Well, honestly,

1163
01:10:06,980 --> 01:10:09,114
I really love your uncle.

1164
01:10:09,116 --> 01:10:11,285
He is an amazing man.

1165
01:10:12,953 --> 01:10:14,785
And you know, we have
been together long enough

1166
01:10:14,787 --> 01:10:16,390
where I know he's the right one.

1167
01:10:24,665 --> 01:10:26,798
Dylan, seriously, cut it out.

1168
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:28,403
You are such a perv.

1169
01:10:55,162 --> 01:10:56,196
Naomi, run!

1170
01:10:57,531 --> 01:10:58,530
Naomi, run!

1171
01:11:07,108 --> 01:11:08,443
Run, Naomi, run!

1172
01:11:10,310 --> 01:11:11,610
Naomi, run!

1173
01:11:11,612 --> 01:11:12,710
Run!

1174
01:11:30,831 --> 01:11:34,066
Naomi, go on, run, baby, run!

1175
01:11:45,145 --> 01:11:46,413
Run, baby, run!

1176
01:12:15,776 --> 01:12:17,077
Naomi, Naomi!

1177
01:12:18,446 --> 01:12:21,612
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, what's going on?

1178
01:12:21,614 --> 01:12:22,448
You okay?

1179
01:12:26,452 --> 01:12:27,953
Oh shit.

1180
01:12:27,955 --> 01:12:29,420
Go, go!

1181
01:12:31,626 --> 01:12:32,794
Come on, I got it!

1182
01:12:37,563 --> 01:12:39,097
What is that thing?

1183
01:12:39,099 --> 01:12:42,366
Hey, hey, hey, this isn't
a pant-pissing contest, run!

1184
01:12:42,368 --> 01:12:44,802
Run, run!

1185
01:12:44,804 --> 01:12:45,639
Right behind you.

1186
01:12:50,077 --> 01:12:50,978
Did she make it?

1187
01:12:51,979 --> 01:12:53,777
I think so.

1188
01:12:53,779 --> 01:12:55,713
I think I know where she's at.

1189
01:12:55,715 --> 01:12:58,216
We just have to make it to it.

1190
01:12:58,218 --> 01:13:00,819
It's gone, we gotta get
inside and call for help.

1191
01:13:00,821 --> 01:13:01,986
Ready, go.

1192
01:13:01,988 --> 01:13:02,823
Go, go!

1193
01:13:10,997 --> 01:13:14,231
So I was a staring it right
in the face, mano y ratto.

1194
01:13:14,233 --> 01:13:16,236
Me and him, it was gonna be.

1195
01:13:17,971 --> 01:13:18,773
Hey, hey.

1196
01:13:21,174 --> 01:13:23,808
I need you to be strong
right now, all right?

1197
01:13:23,810 --> 01:13:25,009
It's gonna be all right.

1198
01:13:25,011 --> 01:13:26,477
What's your name?

1199
01:13:29,517 --> 01:13:31,083
Hey, look at me.

1200
01:13:31,085 --> 01:13:32,618
Listen to my voice.

1201
01:13:32,620 --> 01:13:35,355
I'm Lenny Cusumano,
how you doing?

1202
01:13:36,255 --> 01:13:37,688
What's your name?

1203
01:13:39,292 --> 01:13:40,292
What's your name?

1204
01:13:40,294 --> 01:13:41,694
Naomi, Naomi, Naomi.

1205
01:13:41,696 --> 01:13:45,096
There you go, Naomi, that's
a beautiful name, right.

1206
01:13:45,098 --> 01:13:47,665
Sounds like pudding,
I like pudding.

1207
01:13:47,667 --> 01:13:50,369
Now, stick with Lenny,
everything's gonna be all right.

1208
01:13:50,371 --> 01:13:51,602
All right.

1209
01:13:51,604 --> 01:13:55,307
These tunnels down here,
they run all around

1210
01:13:55,309 --> 01:13:56,611
this park underneath.

1211
01:13:57,778 --> 01:13:59,947
One ran from my cabin
and brought me here.

1212
01:14:01,014 --> 01:14:03,885
Somewhere, that's the good news.

1213
01:14:06,653 --> 01:14:08,887
What's the bad news, Lenny?

1214
01:14:08,889 --> 01:14:09,724
The bad news?

1215
01:14:11,157 --> 01:14:13,794
That big freaking rat, he
likes it down here too.

1216
01:14:16,563 --> 01:14:18,730
Yeah, you can smell him.

1217
01:14:18,732 --> 01:14:22,968
I think that, I think
that way leads to the lodge.

1218
01:14:26,473 --> 01:14:28,073
All right.

1219
01:14:28,075 --> 01:14:29,644
Let's go, come on!

1220
01:14:37,984 --> 01:14:39,383
Please, we're at
Camp Taghkanic Lake

1221
01:14:39,385 --> 01:14:41,352
State Park and Campground,
we're gonna have...

1222
01:14:43,256 --> 01:14:44,556
Are you crazy?

1223
01:14:44,558 --> 01:14:46,525
Now, they will come.

1224
01:14:46,527 --> 01:14:47,926
You start telling them
about some giant rat,

1225
01:14:47,928 --> 01:14:49,663
they're just gonna
hang up on you.

1226
01:14:50,897 --> 01:14:52,931
What do we do, what
do we do, what do we do?

1227
01:14:52,933 --> 01:14:54,232
I got it, I got it, I got it.

1228
01:14:54,234 --> 01:14:55,068
I got it.

1229
01:15:19,626 --> 01:15:22,296
I shut the door, yes,
I know I shut the door.

1230
01:15:23,462 --> 01:15:26,634
Maybe it came in
through the basement.

1231
01:15:28,301 --> 01:15:29,868
I can't believe that
thing killed my...

1232
01:15:29,870 --> 01:15:32,570
Hey hey hey, listen to me,
we have to get out of here.

1233
01:15:32,572 --> 01:15:34,705
We gotta get to my car, and
head straight down the mountain

1234
01:15:34,707 --> 01:15:38,477
to the sheriff's office, I
have another radio in the car.

1235
01:15:38,479 --> 01:15:40,478
But I need you to
be strong right now.

1236
01:15:40,480 --> 01:15:44,316
I am not gonna let that thing
get us, but I need you strong!

1237
01:15:44,318 --> 01:15:47,951
Because I can only get
us out of here as a team,

1238
01:15:47,953 --> 01:15:50,090
and a strong team at that, okay?

1239
01:15:51,591 --> 01:15:53,057
Okay.

1240
01:16:00,099 --> 01:16:02,102
Come on, I'm gonna look.

1241
01:16:04,505 --> 01:16:05,436
Is it safe?

1242
01:16:05,438 --> 01:16:06,339
Shh, shh.

1243
01:16:07,640 --> 01:16:09,673
Okay, all right, it's
clear, we're gonna go.

1244
01:16:09,675 --> 01:16:11,509
Okay, ready, on three.

1245
01:16:11,511 --> 01:16:13,844
One, two, three, go.

1246
01:16:23,189 --> 01:16:25,690
Wait, wait, I
can hear my cousin.

1247
01:16:25,692 --> 01:16:28,696
Yes, those
are my friends!

1248
01:16:32,032 --> 01:16:33,030
Help, help us!

1249
01:16:34,033 --> 01:16:35,001
Help, help!

1250
01:16:37,002 --> 01:16:38,302
Help, help!

1251
01:16:38,304 --> 01:16:39,536
Who the hell's that?

1252
01:16:39,538 --> 01:16:40,338
Those are my friends,
those are my friends,

1253
01:16:40,340 --> 01:16:41,106
let my friends in.

1254
01:16:45,645 --> 01:16:46,977
Get in here!

1255
01:16:48,715 --> 01:16:51,682
Hey, listen, this door
ain't gonna hold very long.

1256
01:16:51,684 --> 01:16:53,718
We gotta keep moving.

1257
01:16:53,720 --> 01:16:56,987
That tunnel, that gives us
better odds than this room.

1258
01:16:56,989 --> 01:16:58,123
You want us to go
down in the mineshaft?

1259
01:16:58,125 --> 01:16:59,057
Yeah.

1260
01:16:59,059 --> 01:16:59,991
That's where it came from.

1261
01:16:59,993 --> 01:17:00,892
I'm not going down there.

1262
01:17:00,894 --> 01:17:02,660
All I got is this bat, man.

1263
01:17:02,662 --> 01:17:03,895
Shut up!

1264
01:17:03,897 --> 01:17:06,563
Listen, I just saved all
your asses, all right,

1265
01:17:06,565 --> 01:17:08,499
and I don't even get
a thank you, Lenny?

1266
01:17:08,501 --> 01:17:09,735
Where did you come from?

1267
01:17:09,737 --> 01:17:11,168
The tunnel.

1268
01:17:11,170 --> 01:17:12,736
The tunnel goes all
the way from the cabin

1269
01:17:12,738 --> 01:17:13,737
over to the lodge.

1270
01:17:13,739 --> 01:17:15,073
What happened to you?

1271
01:17:15,075 --> 01:17:16,807
I was, we were attacked.

1272
01:17:16,809 --> 01:17:18,543
I was pulled in by the tunnel.

1273
01:17:18,545 --> 01:17:19,744
He pulled me into
the tunnel, the rat

1274
01:17:19,746 --> 01:17:21,245
and he looked right
at me like he was

1275
01:17:21,247 --> 01:17:22,748
gonna kill me, right,
and then all of a sudden,

1276
01:17:22,750 --> 01:17:24,382
he just took off and ran.

1277
01:17:24,384 --> 01:17:25,917
What is that,
is that a big rat?

1278
01:17:25,919 --> 01:17:28,753
Yeah, it's a big rat, what
do you think, it's your mom?

1279
01:17:30,890 --> 01:17:32,156
What kind of rat
even gets that big?

1280
01:17:32,158 --> 01:17:34,859
I ain't got no idea
what's this big, lady.

1281
01:17:34,861 --> 01:17:36,727
The biggest rat on
history, recorded,

1282
01:17:36,729 --> 01:17:38,262
is from China in '09,

1283
01:17:38,264 --> 01:17:40,899
and only that was like the
size of a dog, you know.

1284
01:17:40,901 --> 01:17:42,734
I mean, the bamboo Sumatra
rat, that can get up

1285
01:17:42,736 --> 01:17:45,904
to 19 inches, but
this freaking rat,

1286
01:17:45,906 --> 01:17:48,438
this freaking rat's a
freak of freaking nature.

1287
01:17:48,440 --> 01:17:50,441
Yeah, we're talking
like prehistoric

1288
01:17:50,443 --> 01:17:53,677
megaloratumus megasus
or something like that.

1289
01:17:53,679 --> 01:17:55,446
This thing ate my family.

1290
01:17:55,448 --> 01:17:57,951
Oh, it killed more than
just your family, girl.

1291
01:18:01,453 --> 01:18:03,858
I'm sorry, I got
sensitivity issues.

1292
01:18:05,059 --> 01:18:07,359
Hey, hey hey hey, don't
think about it right now

1293
01:18:07,361 --> 01:18:08,959
Don't think about it.

1294
01:18:08,961 --> 01:18:10,460
How are we gonna kill it?

1295
01:18:10,462 --> 01:18:12,463
I don't know, but you can
toss out traditional methods.

1296
01:18:12,465 --> 01:18:15,299
I threw a whole gallon of
my proprietary rat drink

1297
01:18:15,301 --> 01:18:17,869
down that throat,
and nothing, nada.

1298
01:18:17,871 --> 01:18:20,304
Yeah, we gotta think outside
the box, because if this

1299
01:18:20,306 --> 01:18:22,606
thing gets off the
mountain, ahhh.

1300
01:18:22,608 --> 01:18:24,610
Damn! I think he got me.

1301
01:18:26,112 --> 01:18:28,379
I saw my uncle toss a thing
of gasoline into its mouth.

1302
01:18:28,381 --> 01:18:30,147
Maybe we can use that.

1303
01:18:30,149 --> 01:18:31,214
Are you sure it's gasoline?

1304
01:18:31,216 --> 01:18:32,450
Yes, I'm sure it's gasoline!

1305
01:18:32,452 --> 01:18:33,821
- You're positive?
- Yes, I'm positive!

1306
01:18:35,788 --> 01:18:37,155
Hey,
what are you doing?

1307
01:18:37,157 --> 01:18:38,623
Just checking.

1308
01:18:38,625 --> 01:18:39,960
What, do you think I would
be carrying that empty?

1309
01:18:40,894 --> 01:18:42,494
I don't know you.

1310
01:18:42,496 --> 01:18:43,494
Chick.

1311
01:18:43,496 --> 01:18:46,130
Down in the tunnel, now, now!

1312
01:18:46,132 --> 01:18:46,966
Go, go!

1313
01:18:48,335 --> 01:18:50,334
Hey, hey, hey, if you see
a gold chain down there,

1314
01:18:50,336 --> 01:18:51,802
that's mine, keep it.

1315
01:18:51,804 --> 01:18:52,639
I want it.

1316
01:18:53,974 --> 01:18:56,510
All right, I hear you knocking
but you can't come in.

1317
01:18:57,443 --> 01:18:58,312
You want me, huh?

1318
01:19:00,113 --> 01:19:01,681
You wanna piece of Lenny?

1319
01:19:02,916 --> 01:19:04,848
Get what you want,
you dirty rat.

1320
01:19:04,850 --> 01:19:06,319
Come on, you dirty rat.

1321
01:19:07,854 --> 01:19:10,124
Oh ho, you are one mean mother.

1322
01:19:11,524 --> 01:19:12,356
Okay.

1323
01:19:15,028 --> 01:19:17,195
Come on and get me.

1324
01:19:21,801 --> 01:19:23,935
I see a light!

1325
01:19:23,937 --> 01:19:26,102
Let's keep going.

1326
01:19:26,104 --> 01:19:28,673
Where's Lenny, where's Lenny?

1327
01:19:40,886 --> 01:19:43,157
You wanna piece of Lenny?

1328
01:19:45,125 --> 01:19:46,158
Well guess what.

1329
01:20:10,850 --> 01:20:12,652
You've been exterminated.

1330
01:20:13,819 --> 01:20:15,723
Really, that's
your catchphrase?

1331
01:20:16,922 --> 01:20:19,356
Did you find my
gold chain or not?

1332
01:20:19,358 --> 01:20:21,758
No, but I woulda
came up with something

1333
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:24,262
better than you've
been exterminated.

1334
01:20:24,264 --> 01:20:25,695
Yeah, well it's too late,

1335
01:20:25,697 --> 01:20:26,932
because I already
exterminated him,

1336
01:20:26,934 --> 01:20:29,203
and I'm a professional,
see the rat on the back?

1337
01:20:30,202 --> 01:20:31,436
Thank you.

1338
01:20:31,438 --> 01:20:32,436
It's okay,
it's okay, girls.

1339
01:20:32,438 --> 01:20:33,704
Lame.

1340
