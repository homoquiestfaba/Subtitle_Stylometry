4
00:00:20,467 --> 00:00:22,367
I'm happy.

5
00:00:22,418 --> 00:00:25,760
Well Gina, listen to me, I'm fine all right.
I landed on my feet.

6
00:00:25,795 --> 00:00:28,250
I got a great new place,
I'm there right now actually.

7
00:00:29,268 --> 00:00:32,162
Umhmm. Aw, it's in a great neighborhood.
Lots of natural light.

8
00:00:33,197 --> 00:00:34,905
Listen I gotta go,
I'm on the other line okay?

9
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:37,760
Say hi to the new boyfriend
for me. Bye. [beep]

10
00:00:38,276 --> 00:00:39,719
Tony, sorry about that,
it was the ex.

11
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,520
Poor thing just can't move on,
you know what I mean?

12
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:45,817
All right look Tony, Tony,
calm down, listen.

13
00:00:45,852 --> 00:00:47,277
Just give me until the
end of business tomorrow

14
00:00:47,278 --> 00:00:48,578
and I'll have your $2,000, okay.

15
00:00:49,879 --> 00:00:52,114
Well that's just really mean.

16
00:00:52,149 --> 00:00:55,196
All right... look, look, look,
I'm picking up these antique toy soldiers,

17
00:00:55,231 --> 00:00:57,833
their mint, they're worth way
more than $2,000, trust me.

18
00:00:57,868 --> 00:01:00,148
Hey, I'm at the dentist,
can I call you back?

19
00:01:00,183 --> 00:01:03,037
Oh, Tony! Hey, you're here...
Why didn't you...uh...

20
00:01:03,072 --> 00:01:07,387
That's a really great
shirt you're having.

21
00:01:08,018 --> 00:01:10,981
- Just give me till the end of tomorrow.
- Noon.

22
00:01:11,016 --> 00:01:13,544
Ok, noon, yeah...

23
00:01:21,412 --> 00:01:24,346
This is the guy I was
talking about. Ron Snuffkin.

24
00:01:24,381 --> 00:01:26,281
Watch me.

25
00:01:39,313 --> 00:01:42,616
- He's a creep!
- Exactly, he's perfect.

26
00:01:42,651 --> 00:01:44,911
We're working too hard.
Let's just put an ad on Craig's list.

27
00:01:44,946 --> 00:01:47,083
Wanted. Father for three boys.
Bam, we're done.

28
00:01:47,118 --> 00:01:50,482
Good idea! A foot race between
t he pervs and child services.

29
00:01:50,517 --> 00:01:53,365
- Bam! We're screwed.
- I liked my "Bam" better.

30
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:56,851
- It's an excellent choice.
- I'm seeing butt-crack.

31
00:01:56,886 --> 00:01:59,283
- Are we this desperate?
- Shoe-lace untied.

32
00:01:59,318 --> 00:02:03,695
Yes, we are. We've been over a hundred
people, now. We need a dad today.

33
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:06,152
Let's just spread
out and watch him.

34
00:02:06,187 --> 00:02:08,837
Oh, sorry I'm late, folks.
I have some good news.

35
00:02:08,872 --> 00:02:12,341
Just got the new BowFlex in.
Something to think about, ma'am?

36
00:02:12,376 --> 00:02:14,221
Can I speak to your manager?

37
00:02:14,222 --> 00:02:16,226
You don't wanna do that.
What's going on?

38
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:19,138
You told me these sleeping-bags
are rated at 10 below.

39
00:02:19,173 --> 00:02:21,148
My family almost froze to death.

40
00:02:21,183 --> 00:02:23,813
- And you, you all wore the thermals?
- You never mentioned it.

41
00:02:23,848 --> 00:02:25,948
You have to keep your wrist loose.

42
00:02:25,983 --> 00:02:30,324
I'm sure I did. You can check the
security footage if you like.

43
00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:33,652
Unfortunately, I have to pass
this on to another service rep,

44
00:02:33,687 --> 00:02:36,260
I'm dealing with a bit
of a personal crysis.

45
00:02:37,141 --> 00:02:39,041
Yeah? And what's that?

46
00:02:40,499 --> 00:02:45,197
My brother and his wife and kids,
they live in Seattle.

47
00:02:46,435 --> 00:02:48,645
They just got hurt pretty,
pretty badly...

48
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:52,214
at a lumber-jack event.

49
00:02:53,122 --> 00:02:56,947
A chain-saw kicked up on them...

50
00:02:56,982 --> 00:03:01,137
And I need to catch a flight
up there right now, at the ICU.

51
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:03,581
Intensive Care Unit...

52
00:03:05,745 --> 00:03:08,098
I hate to keep you from
your choped-up relatives,

53
00:03:08,133 --> 00:03:10,198
but you think you can
exchange this rollerblades?

54
00:03:10,233 --> 00:03:14,327
- Before you head to the airport...
- My God. Have some compassion.

55
00:03:15,699 --> 00:03:17,540
Alright, people, this is it for me.

56
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:19,670
Sara Beth will help you
back in about an hour.

57
00:03:25,642 --> 00:03:27,334
Pardon me, Sir. Got a minute?

58
00:03:27,335 --> 00:03:29,528
I'm on break, boys.
It'll have to wait.

59
00:03:29,978 --> 00:03:32,042
- What are you doing?
- Hpw you feel about

60
00:03:32,077 --> 00:03:34,696
- lying for money?
- Keep talking.

61
00:03:34,731 --> 00:03:36,794
- We need a dad for the day.
- Say what?

62
00:03:36,829 --> 00:03:39,971
Wait, first, if you could have
dinner with any person in history

63
00:03:40,006 --> 00:03:43,854
- what would you eat?
- Not sure, but it would be wrapped in bacon.

64
00:03:43,889 --> 00:03:45,358
He's good.

65
00:03:45,359 --> 00:03:50,541
- We'll give you $200 for an hour's work.
- $200? What do I have to do?

66
00:03:50,576 --> 00:03:52,600
Fake out the school secretary,
pretend to be our dad

67
00:03:52,635 --> 00:03:55,710
- and sign us up for school.
- Ron, is there a problem out here?

68
00:03:55,745 --> 00:03:58,341
No, no problem, Eric.
Thank you, it's all good.

69
00:03:58,376 --> 00:04:01,514
There are several people just standing
in line at the customer's service.

70
00:04:01,549 --> 00:04:03,320
Hey, did you check
the suggestion box?

71
00:04:03,321 --> 00:04:05,512
I filled up one of
the comment cards.

72
00:04:05,547 --> 00:04:07,578
- Nice!
- Yeah. Go get it!

73
00:04:08,246 --> 00:04:09,930
So are you in, Ron?

74
00:04:09,931 --> 00:04:12,268
Can we just slow this down for a second?
I don't even know your guys names.

75
00:04:12,303 --> 00:04:14,109
Gary, Brandon, Robby.

76
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:16,857
Details are all in there.
Be at school by noon.

77
00:04:16,892 --> 00:04:18,395
Wear a suit.

78
00:04:18,396 --> 00:04:20,711
- I don't have a suit.
- We can give you one of dad's old ones.

79
00:04:20,746 --> 00:04:22,661
He's not gonna need
it any time soon.

80
00:04:22,696 --> 00:04:25,230
Ok, I'm gonna be
honest with you guys,

81
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,697
- You kinda scare me a little right now.
- No problem.

82
00:04:27,732 --> 00:04:30,477
We'll find someone else who wants
to do some easy money. Come on.

83
00:04:30,512 --> 00:04:32,412
See ya. Don't tell
the police about us.

84
00:04:34,494 --> 00:04:36,933
Hey, hey, hey! Wait a sec!

85
00:04:36,968 --> 00:04:40,735
Listen! I am interested, ok, but...

86
00:04:42,288 --> 00:04:44,710
Alright, step a bit aside.

87
00:04:45,258 --> 00:04:47,884
What is the deal
with your real dad?

88
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:49,329
We're not gonna get into that.

89
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,186
- You guys didn't kill him, did you?
- No!

90
00:04:51,187 --> 00:04:53,075
- Did he kill someone?
- He's a banker!

91
00:04:53,076 --> 00:04:55,191
Oh, so he's in prison?

92
00:04:56,644 --> 00:04:59,895
Oh my God, he's in prison.
What was it? Mortgages, mail fraud, what?

93
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:01,798
It was a stock thing. 25 years.

94
00:05:01,799 --> 00:05:03,729
He sorta stole from the rich
and gave to some other rich.

95
00:05:03,764 --> 00:05:05,664
From who later he stole
again but not as much.

96
00:05:05,695 --> 00:05:09,206
Brandon, shut up!
And it's not gonna be 25 years!

97
00:05:09,241 --> 00:05:10,859
He's gonna escape anyway.

98
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,334
- Right.
- Look, man,

99
00:05:12,335 --> 00:05:15,875
we don't wanna end up being foster kids,
so please, keep your mouth shut?

100
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:18,470
OK, alright, so where's mom?

101
00:05:18,505 --> 00:05:20,905
- She left a long time ago.
- And you guys are really on yor own?

102
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:22,536
Probably living in
a car or something?

103
00:05:22,537 --> 00:05:24,767
- Who does that?
- No one.

104
00:05:24,802 --> 00:05:27,224
Our dad kept an investment
home in cash over ***.

105
00:05:27,259 --> 00:05:29,396
We made it all the way here
by ourselves from Jersey.

106
00:05:29,431 --> 00:05:31,914
Robby ***

107
00:05:31,949 --> 00:05:33,537
Those beans were mine.

108
00:05:33,538 --> 00:05:36,807
Make a break time, Ron.
What do you say? $200 for an hour's work?

109
00:05:42,253 --> 00:05:45,665
Alright, boys, let's play house.

110
00:05:52,737 --> 00:05:54,650
This suit is not cut well.

111
00:05:54,685 --> 00:05:57,031
Have you been in a
suit that is cut well?

112
00:05:57,066 --> 00:05:59,215
Don't worry about the suit.
It's all about the walk, okay?

113
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:01,378
A good model can
sell a garbage bag.

114
00:06:01,413 --> 00:06:03,554
- Hiya.
- Hi!

115
00:06:03,589 --> 00:06:06,109
So, good looking
bunch you got there.

116
00:06:06,144 --> 00:06:09,134
- Oh, don't I know it? It's all their mother.
- Where is mom?

117
00:06:10,677 --> 00:06:12,639
Still in picture?

118
00:06:12,674 --> 00:06:14,839
No...

119
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:19,183
No, she never left the "Big Easy",

120
00:06:19,218 --> 00:06:22,060
New Orleans... You've heard of it?

121
00:06:22,095 --> 00:06:25,893
It's a great town. Great great town.
It's a shame we had to live,

122
00:06:25,928 --> 00:06:28,809
but nevertheless it's a town
that haunts our every moment,

123
00:06:28,844 --> 00:06:31,802
I mean the biys dream of
flood waters every night,

124
00:06:31,837 --> 00:06:35,890
Me myself was strung with addictions
to anti-psychotics, meta-amphetamines,

125
00:06:35,925 --> 00:06:40,477
When my bride... ***,
as she called her,

126
00:06:40,512 --> 00:06:45,286
When she...When she passed...
We got.. We just...

127
00:06:47,478 --> 00:06:50,134
It's ok.

128
00:06:50,169 --> 00:06:52,069
Is it?

129
00:06:54,575 --> 00:06:58,900
Yeah, just give a shout when you're
done and you guys'd be good to go.

130
00:06:58,935 --> 00:07:02,084
Oh, that sounds wonderful,
thank you.

131
00:07:05,809 --> 00:07:09,404
Down stick. That's how it's done.

132
00:07:12,958 --> 00:07:16,586
I gotta ask. Did you have that Katrina
thing going in, or did it just come up?

133
00:07:16,621 --> 00:07:18,649
- No, no, I was just getting in the zone.
- You just missed our turn.

134
00:07:18,684 --> 00:07:21,175
Yeah, I know, I lied to you.
We gotta do a quick stop.

135
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:22,675
Ron!

136
00:07:22,676 --> 00:07:25,364
Look, I just gotta show my grandma
that I got a family now. That's all.

137
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:28,980
We got a little falling out a few years
ago, a disagreement where the country was
headed.

138
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:31,093
She's not doing so well
now and I feel guilty

139
00:07:31,128 --> 00:07:33,139
About calling her an
Eisenhower doucebag.

140
00:07:33,174 --> 00:07:35,994
So what do you kids say? You wanna
help cheer an old lady before she dies?

141
00:07:36,029 --> 00:07:38,001
I'm out of here.

142
00:07:40,088 --> 00:07:42,911
- What the hell are you doing?
- ***!

143
00:07:42,946 --> 00:07:45,695
That is insane! Ok,
everybody just calm the hell down!

144
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:48,457
We're gonna just pay a little
visit to an old lady. That is all.

145
00:07:49,117 --> 00:07:51,641
Alright. Let's make this quick.

146
00:07:51,676 --> 00:07:53,190
I'm not going!

147
00:07:53,191 --> 00:07:56,419
We'll wait here. Point to us.
We'll wave and smile.

148
00:07:59,976 --> 00:08:03,926
Ok, fine. Wave good.

149
00:08:09,236 --> 00:08:11,046
We chose the wrong dad!

150
00:08:11,047 --> 00:08:12,663
We could have gone with
that biker guy I picked out.

151
00:08:12,664 --> 00:08:15,719
- He was black, Brandon!
- You have no imagination.

152
00:08:15,754 --> 00:08:17,203
What if mom was albina?

153
00:08:17,204 --> 00:08:18,975
- Go to hell!
- I can't yet!

154
00:08:18,976 --> 00:08:22,023
- I have kids to raise.
- You don't have kids!

155
00:08:22,058 --> 00:08:24,025
I do, they're with me right now,
in fact, okay?

156
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:27,341
And I wanna tell you I
love them each so much,

157
00:08:27,376 --> 00:08:30,270
They're so special, it's just they open
my eyes to something new every day,

158
00:08:30,305 --> 00:08:32,565
They just...

159
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:35,930
Stole my car! Unbelieveable! Kids!

160
00:08:35,965 --> 00:08:37,922
No driving!

161
00:08:56,862 --> 00:09:00,213
Okay! Well done!

162
00:09:00,214 --> 00:09:04,752
I just want you to know that you
really disappointed Ethel, okay?

163
00:09:04,787 --> 00:09:08,471
Another thing. This is $180.
You short me 20, you short stack.

164
00:09:09,155 --> 00:09:11,287
We deducted my $20 you
took off the floor.

165
00:09:11,322 --> 00:09:14,200
Oh, I didn't think you saw that.

166
00:09:16,115 --> 00:09:18,016
So, huh, this is a pretty decent
setup you got going on here.

167
00:09:18,084 --> 00:09:20,285
What are we looking at,
like, 3,000 square feet?

168
00:09:20,353 --> 00:09:21,353
What's the temp like inside?

169
00:09:21,421 --> 00:09:22,688
We're busy, Ron.

170
00:09:22,755 --> 00:09:24,223
Yeah, yeah, I know. Me, too.

171
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:26,391
Why don't you guys just let
me come in and hang out

172
00:09:26,459 --> 00:09:28,460
for little bit,
huh? The AC's out at my place.

173
00:09:28,528 --> 00:09:30,429
That place?

174
00:09:30,496 --> 00:09:32,164
Yeah, it's temporary, okay?

175
00:09:32,232 --> 00:09:34,433
Look, you guys, I took

176
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,968
sick day to come and help you.

177
00:09:36,035 --> 00:09:37,703
The least you could
do is invite me in.

178
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:38,704
Ron, we're fine on our own.

179
00:09:38,771 --> 00:09:39,838
Yeah, loser!

180
00:09:39,906 --> 00:09:40,906
Okay, look, guys, let's just...

181
00:09:40,974 --> 00:09:42,941
Ron, our dad was a major player

182
00:09:43,009 --> 00:09:44,710
in the banking world.
You sell balls.

183
00:09:44,777 --> 00:09:45,978
See a difference there?

184
00:09:46,045 --> 00:09:47,512
Little bit, maybe?

185
00:10:00,927 --> 00:10:02,961
WOMAN: What the...
? Who threw that?!

186
00:10:03,029 --> 00:10:04,129
Have fun with that.

187
00:10:04,197 --> 00:10:06,798
You can keep the <i>bicyclette.</i>

188
00:10:08,568 --> 00:10:09,534
Oh, brother.

189
00:10:09,602 --> 00:10:10,903
? ?

190
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:13,038
What in the world is
going on 4out here?!

191
00:10:28,647 --> 00:10:29,914
Get your hot links!

192
00:10:29,982 --> 00:10:32,350
Bratwurst! Polish sausage!

193
00:10:32,418 --> 00:10:34,686
We only have hot dogs.
We're selling dreams, Robby.

194
00:10:34,753 --> 00:10:38,122
What are you doing?
Nobody cleared this booth with me.

195
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:40,158
We are supposed to be
keeping a low profile.

196
00:10:40,226 --> 00:10:42,427
You're the one who's always
talking about trying to fit in.

197
00:10:42,495 --> 00:10:44,596
This will give us a perfect
chance to meet new people.

198
00:10:44,663 --> 00:10:47,065
Let them get to know us...
through our meats.

199
00:10:47,132 --> 00:10:48,600
I'll have a bratwurst.

200
00:10:48,667 --> 00:10:49,367
See?

201
00:10:49,435 --> 00:10:51,135
Coming right up.

202
00:10:51,203 --> 00:10:52,737
Let me just fire up the grill.

203
00:10:56,775 --> 00:10:58,810
Oh, what happened? I don't know.

204
00:10:58,878 --> 00:11:00,612
Oops.

205
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:02,647
And now they know us.

206
00:11:02,715 --> 00:11:05,550
(siren approaching) Okay. Let's go.

207
00:11:05,618 --> 00:11:07,619
Hey.

208
00:11:07,686 --> 00:11:09,888
Oh, brother. What do you guys want?

209
00:11:09,955 --> 00:11:11,356
We need you again.

210
00:11:11,423 --> 00:11:12,490
Same drill as before.

211
00:11:12,558 --> 00:11:13,925
A little small talk
with the principal.

212
00:11:13,993 --> 00:11:15,393
You know, "Nice
weather we're having.

213
00:11:15,461 --> 00:11:17,161
Sorry about the explosion,
" and you're out of there.

214
00:11:17,229 --> 00:11:18,396
What happened?

215
00:11:18,464 --> 00:11:19,531
Robbie stole some camping
fuel from your store

216
00:11:19,598 --> 00:11:20,698
and launched a fireball

217
00:11:20,766 --> 00:11:22,200
at the school's fall festival.

218
00:11:22,268 --> 00:11:23,902
You can see the outline of the
stilt man on the gym wall.

219
00:11:23,969 --> 00:11:25,904
Nice work. Piss off!

220
00:11:25,971 --> 00:11:27,539
You piss off! You-You know what?

221
00:11:27,606 --> 00:11:28,806
I shouldn't even be
talking to you guys

222
00:11:28,874 --> 00:11:29,641
after the way you treated Ethel.
You know that?

223
00:11:29,708 --> 00:11:31,442
But I like you kids.

224
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:32,510
And clearly, you need me.

225
00:11:32,578 --> 00:11:34,012
So, let's call a
spade a spade here.

226
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:35,046
A thousand bucks.

227
00:11:35,114 --> 00:11:36,214
No way. $300.

228
00:11:36,282 --> 00:11:37,415
Okay. All right. I get it.

229
00:11:37,483 --> 00:11:38,883
You're kids. Your back's
up against the wall.

230
00:11:38,951 --> 00:11:40,084
You're vulnerable.

231
00:11:40,152 --> 00:11:41,853
$500. $350.

232
00:11:41,921 --> 00:11:42,687
Deal. Get in. Come on.

233
00:11:44,156 --> 00:11:45,523
All right. So, $400 it is.

234
00:11:45,591 --> 00:11:47,358
Plus, a small, little favor.

235
00:11:48,694 --> 00:11:50,595
Ow, God.

236
00:11:50,663 --> 00:11:51,863
Where's my money?!

237
00:11:51,931 --> 00:11:53,064
What's his problem?

238
00:11:55,401 --> 00:11:57,135
(school bell rings)

239
00:11:57,202 --> 00:11:58,603
When did you get to town?

240
00:11:58,671 --> 00:11:59,871
Last week. A few months ago.

241
00:11:59,939 --> 00:12:00,905
Uh...

242
00:12:00,973 --> 00:12:02,140
Last week,

243
00:12:02,207 --> 00:12:03,441
but it feels like a few months ago.

244
00:12:03,509 --> 00:12:04,909
That's Tucson for you, right?

245
00:12:04,977 --> 00:12:06,077
How old is Robby?

246
00:12:06,145 --> 00:12:07,011
He's nine. Eight.

247
00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:08,246
Eight?

248
00:12:08,314 --> 00:12:09,447
Oh. How <i>old</i> is he?

249
00:12:09,515 --> 00:12:10,815
He's eight.

250
00:12:10,883 --> 00:12:12,283
Can you explain

251
00:12:12,351 --> 00:12:15,353
how an eight-year-old got
ahold of camping fuel?

252
00:12:15,421 --> 00:12:16,588
He gave it to me. No clue.

253
00:12:16,655 --> 00:12:18,456
Uh, Robby, why don't
you go out to the car

254
00:12:18,524 --> 00:12:20,224
and start the air
conditioner for me?

255
00:12:20,292 --> 00:12:21,492
It gets hot, you know?

256
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:24,062
Go on. Chop, chop.

257
00:12:24,129 --> 00:12:25,463
(school bell rings)

258
00:12:25,531 --> 00:12:26,664
MAGGIE: Robby?

259
00:12:26,732 --> 00:12:28,299
ROBBY: Whatever. Oh.

260
00:12:28,367 --> 00:12:31,769
You. The, uh, Rollerblader, right?

261
00:12:31,837 --> 00:12:33,771
(laughs) Wow.

262
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:34,739
You're Robby's father?

263
00:12:34,807 --> 00:12:36,274
Yeah, I am.

264
00:12:36,342 --> 00:12:37,442
Perfect.

265
00:12:37,509 --> 00:12:38,409
John, the kid brought an explosive

266
00:12:38,477 --> 00:12:40,144
onto school property--

267
00:12:40,212 --> 00:12:40,945
Well, actually,
it was camping fuel.

268
00:12:41,013 --> 00:12:42,146
Sally Teal's gonna need

269
00:12:42,214 --> 00:12:43,581
therapy and a wig.

270
00:12:43,649 --> 00:12:45,750
I can't have them
in class together.

271
00:12:45,818 --> 00:12:47,819
Maggie, you have the only class
with room for another student.

272
00:12:47,886 --> 00:12:49,487
MAGGIE: John, I have 34 kids

273
00:12:49,555 --> 00:12:51,389
and with Robby, you're killing me.

274
00:12:51,457 --> 00:12:53,124
Guys, let's not blame Robby, okay?

275
00:12:53,192 --> 00:12:54,659
Let's blame the person

276
00:12:54,727 --> 00:12:55,827
responsible here.

277
00:12:55,894 --> 00:12:57,362
His father.

278
00:12:58,329 --> 00:13:00,797
You know, he hasn't
been around much lately.

279
00:13:00,865 --> 00:13:03,634
You get a good job.
Start climbing up in the ranks.

280
00:13:03,701 --> 00:13:04,935
Next thing you know,
you wake up one morning,

281
00:13:05,003 --> 00:13:06,436
and you are literally
living at your office.

282
00:13:06,504 --> 00:13:11,408
It starts small.
You miss a practice, then a game.

283
00:13:11,476 --> 00:13:12,643
Then the season is gone.

284
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:13,877
They say they don't mind,

285
00:13:13,945 --> 00:13:15,312
but their eyes tell
a different story.

286
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:17,381
The kids are asking you
to come to career day,

287
00:13:17,448 --> 00:13:18,849
but you're not going to be there,

288
00:13:18,917 --> 00:13:19,850
'cause you can't even hear them.
Want to know why?

289
00:13:19,851 --> 00:13:21,852
'Cause you're too busy crushing

290
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,620
1988.

291
00:13:23,688 --> 00:13:25,689
I was superintendent of the
Flagstaff school system.

292
00:13:25,757 --> 00:13:27,558
Had a portrait at City Hall,

293
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:29,626
my pick of tables at
the best restaurants...

294
00:13:29,694 --> 00:13:32,596
and a pair of sons selling crack
cocaine out of my basement.

295
00:13:35,533 --> 00:13:36,800
(sighs)

296
00:13:38,169 --> 00:13:39,970
You think the principal
suspects anything?

297
00:13:40,038 --> 00:13:41,171
Who cares?

298
00:13:41,239 --> 00:13:42,406
We do, Robby! If they find us,

299
00:13:42,473 --> 00:13:43,640
they'll split us up.

300
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:45,142
You want to go live with
some weird foster mom

301
00:13:45,209 --> 00:13:46,543
with a bunch of cats?

302
00:13:46,611 --> 00:13:48,645
You always go right to that
old lady with the cats.

303
00:13:48,713 --> 00:13:50,247
What about the kids who
end up with celebrities

304
00:13:50,315 --> 00:13:51,715
and sports legends?

305
00:13:51,783 --> 00:13:52,916
'Cause that's who I'd pick.

306
00:13:52,984 --> 00:13:54,217
Check it out.

307
00:13:54,285 --> 00:13:55,385
Oh. We're just glad

308
00:13:55,453 --> 00:13:57,154
to have you Gundersons
here in Tucson.

309
00:13:57,221 --> 00:13:58,355
Likewise. Looks like we're okay.

310
00:13:58,423 --> 00:13:59,356
So, we're all good?

311
00:13:59,424 --> 00:14:01,258
Absolutely. Yes.

312
00:14:01,326 --> 00:14:03,393
And we'll let Maggie
make that call on Robby.

313
00:14:03,461 --> 00:14:04,661
om. Okay.

314
00:14:04,729 --> 00:14:06,930
Right. Uh... So, uh...

315
00:14:06,998 --> 00:14:08,565
We're all good, right? No.

316
00:14:08,633 --> 00:14:09,600
I have a few more questions.

317
00:14:09,667 --> 00:14:11,134
How can you assure me that Robby--

318
00:14:11,202 --> 00:14:12,302
Is this going to take
more than one minute?

319
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:13,670
What do you think?

320
00:14:13,738 --> 00:14:15,472
It's just, I have an urgent
appointment off campus

321
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:16,940
I have to get to.
So, I'll tell you what.

322
00:14:17,008 --> 00:14:18,508
Why don't you and I
finish this tonight?

323
00:14:18,576 --> 00:14:19,810
10:00? Drinks? Stallion Club?

324
00:14:19,877 --> 00:14:22,713
4:00. No drinks. In my classroom.

325
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:25,148
If you're late,
you're home-schooling Robby.

326
00:14:25,216 --> 00:14:26,016
Okay, sounds good, Maggie.

327
00:14:26,084 --> 00:14:27,618
Miss Morales is fine.

328
00:14:27,685 --> 00:14:28,852
Miss Morales.

329
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,187
You little...

330
00:14:30,254 --> 00:14:31,722
What are you doing? Close the deal.

331
00:14:31,789 --> 00:14:33,123
Yeah. I will, at 4:00.

332
00:14:33,191 --> 00:14:34,891
But I'm much less
persuasive if I'm dead.

333
00:14:37,395 --> 00:14:38,629
GARY: What's the deal, Ron?

334
00:14:38,696 --> 00:14:39,997
You want to know the deal?

335
00:14:40,064 --> 00:14:42,299
There. That's the King
and Patriots collection.

336
00:14:42,367 --> 00:14:44,101
Worth two grand.

337
00:14:44,168 --> 00:14:46,436
Those are actually somewhere
inside my Grandma Ethel's house.

338
00:14:46,504 --> 00:14:49,106
I got to find them and sell them,
so I can pay back Tony.

339
00:14:49,173 --> 00:14:52,209
The, uh, nice gentleman you met
with the baseball bat earlier.

340
00:14:52,276 --> 00:14:53,844
I still don't understand
why you need us.

341
00:14:53,911 --> 00:14:55,712
Ah, she's got this weird thing

342
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:57,080
about keeping them in the family,

343
00:14:57,148 --> 00:14:59,216
passing them down to the kids.

344
00:14:59,283 --> 00:15:00,684
I don't care if they're your kids.

345
00:15:00,785 --> 00:15:02,252
I don't care if
they're Jerry's kids.

346
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,620
They're not getting anywhere near

347
00:15:03,688 --> 00:15:04,988
those soldiers.

348
00:15:05,056 --> 00:15:05,989
Okay, but you said you wanted

349
00:15:06,057 --> 00:15:07,124
to keep them in the family.

350
00:15:07,191 --> 00:15:09,126
I also said I'm not a racist,

351
00:15:09,193 --> 00:15:10,927
but that doesn't make it true.

352
00:15:10,995 --> 00:15:13,096
(bird chirping) Oh, son of a bitch!

353
00:15:13,164 --> 00:15:16,500
Those damn squirrels are
in my bird feeder again!

00:15:16,567 --> 00:15:18,669
(Ethel grumbling) Uh-huh.

355
00:15:18,736 --> 00:15:20,003
GARY: She's gone.

356
00:15:20,071 --> 00:15:21,638
Now, go find them.

357
00:15:21,706 --> 00:15:26,576
Oh, my God. Unbelievable.

358
00:15:26,644 --> 00:15:28,745
Keep him occupied, okay?

359
00:15:28,813 --> 00:15:30,447
What? He's got a bat!

360
00:15:30,515 --> 00:15:31,581
Well, then, find a ball!

the bus station bathroom.

What are you doing? Oklahoma!

366
00:15:43,127 --> 00:15:44,928
What?

367
00:15:53,337 --> 00:15:56,306
Oh, thank God. The doctor. What?

368
00:15:56,374 --> 00:15:58,475
We don't need a doctor!
We need a priest!

369
00:15:58,543 --> 00:16:00,811
We are not letting her die,
Gary! Come here!

370
00:16:04,315 --> 00:16:05,515
Oh!

371
00:16:17,462 --> 00:16:19,162
You have to save Grandma!
I think she's dying!

372
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:20,697
Let her die with dignity!

373
00:16:20,765 --> 00:16:22,065
You took an oath! What?

374
00:16:22,133 --> 00:16:23,834
Look around.
Is this any kind of life?

375
00:16:23,901 --> 00:16:25,435
Okay. Enough!

376
00:16:25,503 --> 00:16:26,670
Okay, she's ready now.

377
00:16:26,738 --> 00:16:28,271
What? Uh...

378
00:16:28,339 --> 00:16:29,406
What am I doing?

379
00:16:29,474 --> 00:16:30,640
We can't play God.

380
00:16:30,708 --> 00:16:31,875

help the poor woman.

382

Oh!

383

Ah!

384

Oh, Ethel.

389
00:16:53,998 --> 00:16:56,032
Oh, no.

390
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,335
? ?

391
00:17:20,758 --> 00:17:22,893
Oops.

392
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:23,894
Play time's over, boys.

393
00:17:23,961 --> 00:17:25,028
Where is he?

394
00:17:25,096 --> 00:17:26,296
Let's just tell him. Gary.

395
00:17:26,364 --> 00:17:29,009
No, really.
We don't owe him anything.

396
00:17:29,102 --> 00:17:31,573
He's in basement.

397
00:17:34,863 --> 00:17:35,983

00:17:39,609 --> 00:17:40,229
Oh.

401
00:17:40,449 --> 00:17:42,149
Now, you guys get his pants off

402
00:17:42,198 --> 00:17:43,598
and i'll go pickout the right wig..

403
00:17:49,425 --> 00:17:50,926
Uh, I can't believe she actually--

404
00:17:50,993 --> 00:17:53,828
We agreed not to talk about it.
Just get us to school, please.

405
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,100
Hey.

406
00:17:59,168 --> 00:18:00,468
No, no!

Wow. What is that, a word castle?

410
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:10,111
Look at that.
That is very creative.

411
00:18:10,179 --> 00:18:11,646
You missed your chance. I'm busy.

412
00:18:11,714 --> 00:18:13,815
Aww. What are you doing?

413
00:18:13,883 --> 00:18:16,351
I'm transcribing the
history of papier-mâché.

414
00:18:16,419 --> 00:18:17,652
The printer doesn't work.

415
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:18,853
I thought that was a microwave.

416
00:18:20,323 --> 00:18:22,123
I told you 4:00.

417
00:18:22,191 --> 00:18:24,592
I know, I know, I know.

418
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:27,796
I'm going to be totally honest
with you right now, okay?

419
00:18:27,863 --> 00:18:30,031
I was saving a man's
life this afternoon.

420
00:18:30,099 --> 00:18:31,633
I'm finishing this,

421
00:18:31,701 --> 00:18:33,268
and then I need to get my
car out of the impound.

422
00:18:33,336 --> 00:18:34,836
Impound? Listen.

423
00:18:34,904 --> 00:18:36,471
Why don't you wait until tomorrow.
I can help you

424
00:18:36,539 --> 00:18:38,707
because I know Carlos
down there really well.

425
00:18:38,808 --> 00:18:40,742
No. I promised myself
I'd get it done today.

426
00:18:42,054 --> 00:18:45,134
It's been there for two weeks
and I just need to deal with it.

427
00:18:45,169 --> 00:18:46,948
I'm tired of rules being to school

428
00:18:46,949 --> 00:18:48,471
it gives me funny.

429
00:18:48,472 --> 00:18:51,675
Yeah, uh, I can see that.
Look I get it, I get it, you know,

430
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:54,667
You're overworked, under appreciated You're
thinkin', what's one more kid? You know.

431

"can't save them all." So what?

432
00:18:56,014 --> 00:18:59,566
Robby turns to a life of crime in the
streets, odds are he's not gonna rob your
house.

433
00:18:59,601 --> 00:19:01,832
I'm a teacher,
I don't have a house.

434
00:19:01,867 --> 00:19:04,176
Look all right, all right.
What if I solve your printer problem?

435
00:19:04,211 --> 00:19:06,111
Then can Robby stay?

436
00:19:06,782 --> 00:19:08,682
Come on, please!

437
00:19:09,656 --> 00:19:12,512
Fine. Deal.

438
00:19:12,547 --> 00:19:15,024
There's no way you're gonna
get that printer fixed though.

439
00:19:15,059 --> 00:19:17,609
Oh. No, no, no.
I'm not going to fix it.

440
00:19:18,444 --> 00:19:20,126
You're right, Ron.

441
00:19:20,127 --> 00:19:22,313
I should just man up and
tell my boy that I love him.

442
00:19:23,241 --> 00:19:24,709
You will thank
yourself for it Johnny.

443
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:27,046
And do not forget
to journal it, Okay?

444
00:19:27,081 --> 00:19:31,229
And again, I am just so sorry
about the printer, Maggie.

445
00:19:31,264 --> 00:19:32,854
It's a disgrace.

446
00:19:32,855 --> 00:19:35,211
Just don't let the other teachers
know I let you have mine.

447

[clears throat]

448
00:19:40,052 --> 00:19:44,063
So um... Robby can start
tomorrow Ms.Moralez?

449
00:19:44,098 --> 00:19:45,853
Maggie's fine.

450
00:19:45,854 --> 00:19:48,292
Oh... well that's
a new progression.

Unh. This is good day huh?

454
00:19:59,086 --> 00:19:59,486
So what's on the
schedule for manana?

455

Well, we'll be going to school,
and you'll be eating dashboard bacon.

456
00:20:04,072 --> 00:20:07,204
A, uh, actually I think we work
pretty well together. Don't you?

457
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:09,680
Thinkin' maybe we should make
this a bit more of a regular gig?

458
00:20:09,715 --> 00:20:12,434
That's a pretty big step, Ron,
and you're kinda annoying.

459
00:20:12,469 --> 00:20:15,903
You're kinda annoying! You know.
See you're acting like a child. Okay.

460
00:20:15,938 --> 00:20:18,358
You guys are gonna need me
a lot more than you think.

461
00:20:18,393 --> 00:20:20,512
What if you need a
doctor's note for school?

462
00:20:20,547 --> 00:20:23,319
Or a ride to the mall? Plus,
I can buy beer!

Not, not that you should be drinking.
You should not be drinking.

know, but you will do incredible things.

getting at. Don't drink

your principal both think I'm your dad

What's your offer
and make it short?
