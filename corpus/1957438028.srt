-Hi.

183
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:13,020
Hi, hi, hi, hello.

184
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:17,230
Wow. It's been a while.

185
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:18,830
You look healthy.

186
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:23,430
Uh, yeah. Thank you.

187
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:28,870
You too, you also look healthy,
as well.

188
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,380
Do I look healthy?

189
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:32,880
[chuckles]

190
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,880
Yes, remarkably healthy.

191
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,950
Hi. Sorry, this is my daughter,
Hannah.

192
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:40,120
Hannah, this is Luke.
We grew up together.

193
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,090
Hi, Hannah, nice to meet you.

194
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:45,760
I told you it would be just like
when you were a kid.

195
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:50,730
Um, I would love to stay
and catch up

196
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:52,960
but we better run,
our ride is waiting.

197
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:55,430
Oh, shoot, I was supposed to...

198
00:08:58,740 --> 00:08:59,970
Ta da.

199
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:01,640
Joyce got caught up with
some stuff at the bakery

200
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:04,140
and she asked me to do her
a favor, so, here I am.

201
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:06,740
You shall be riding with me.

202
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:11,320
-Ok.
-Ok.

203
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,550
Ok.

204
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,220
Right this way.

205
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,130
So were you there this morning
when the tree fell?

206
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:24,430
No, I wasn't, but I heard
that as things go,

207
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:27,100
it was lucky your dad swooped in
when he did.

208
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,900
He hasn't given you
the play-by-play?

209
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,670
I actually haven't spoken
to him yet.

210
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:37,310
Oh. Well, the hotel's talking
about how brave he is.

211
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:40,850
I bet he hates that.
My Dad, the hero.

212
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:44,780
Hey, welcome home.

213
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:47,020
Since when did the parade
have a cash prize?

214
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,590
Has it been that long since
you've been here?

215
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:50,090
Four years.

216
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,590
Well, we've been doing it
for three years

217
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:53,990
and the mayor thought
if she offered

218
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:56,090
a cash prize it would attract
more tourists.

219
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,500
Well, it seems to be working

220
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,800
'cause the harbor has way more
boats than I remember.

221
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,300
$25,000 grand, huh?

222
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,970
Don't you start getting
any ideas?

223
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:06,300
I don't even think your mom
could get the boat ready
in time,

224
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:08,510
especially considering the shape
it's in.

225
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:10,040
What did you say?

226
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,180
Oh, no, don't get me wrong.

227
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:12,440
If anybody could get
the boat ready...

228
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:13,940
No, no, no, no, no.

229
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:15,180
It would be your mom, 'cause
she was the absolute best...

230
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:16,710
You said with the shape
it's in?

231
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,880
Yeah.

232
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,550
It's still down there?

233
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:22,450
Of course. It's never
gone anywhere.

234
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,220
Hannah, come on.

235
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,630
Where are you going?

236
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:37,400
Ok, well, we don't,
I just, uh. I don't...

237
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,540
Ok.

238
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,910
Not quite how you remember it,
is it?

239
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:46,240
Not exactly.

240
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:48,880
Are you sure this is
the right one?

241
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:59,190
Why would your dad tell you
he sold it?

242
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:01,360
That's a good question.

243
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:11,270
♪

244
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:17,070
Ok, you got it from here?

245
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,440
Yep. What do you say?

246
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:22,680
Thanks for the ride, Mr. Luke.
Merry Christmas.

247
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,520
Very merry Christmas to you too,
Miss Hannah.

248
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,680
And I'm sure I'll be seeing
both of you around town.

249
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:29,050
Yeah. Thanks again.

250
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:31,260
Welcome home.

251
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:33,420
Ok, you ready?
Let's do this.

252
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:35,090
[knocking]

253
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:41,070
-Grandpa!
-Hello.

254
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,600
Merry Christmas, Dad.

255
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:47,540
Oh hi, kiddo.

256
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,410
I'm just saying,
without a Christmas tree

257
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:58,420
it's going to be very difficult
for Santa

258
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:00,950
to know where to put presents
on the big night.

259
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:03,950
Is that a risk you really
want to take?

260
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,990
I guess I never considered
the consequences.

261
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:08,160
Hey, Banana?

262
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,590
Why don't you go explore
for a little bit?

263
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,800
Good idea.

264
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,830
I need to know what
we're dealing with here.

265
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:19,000
So, I hear you're a local
celebrity now?

266
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:22,270
Bunch of nonsense.
Right place, right time.

267
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,280
Maybe.

268
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,610
How're you feeling?

269
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:27,750
Oh this? Doc's being
over cautious.

270
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,180
It's a little sore,
that's all.

271
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:32,180
When Joyce called she said
you needed help.

272
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:34,690
How are the repairs going
on the house?

273
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:38,120
We haven't started yet,

274
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:41,190
but the insurance money
should come through this week.

275
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:42,260
Well...

276
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,100
You're welcome to stay here
as long as you need.

277
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,500
Thanks.

278
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:51,370
But we'll only stay until
you're back on your feet.

279
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:53,140
Gonna be a short visit then.

280
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:55,540
All the same, I think we'll
stay through Christmas,

281
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:56,840
just to make sure.

282
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,310
Well, suit yourself,

283
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:00,610
but you know I don't make
a big deal out of that here.

284
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:02,150
I know that.

285
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:08,290
So we stopped by the marina,
on the way here.

286
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,560
You said you were selling
the boat.

287
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:15,360
I was. I just never
got around to it.

288
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,330
I wish I'd known that
you changed your mind.

289
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:18,560
I didn't change my mind,
I just...

290
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,500
Never got around to it.

291
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,630
<i> Joyce: Merry Christmas!</i>

292
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,670
Oh, boy.

293
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:28,470
Here you help me with-
You take this.

294
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:29,710
-Ok.
-Thank you.

295
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:32,140
You're here! You're here!

296
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:34,210
Oh, it is so good to see you.

297
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:35,680
Oh, you too.

298
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,080
I forget how much you
look like your mother.

299
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,850
Big surprise, no tree
upstairs either.

300
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:43,650
Honey, this is Joyce Benson.

301
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:45,360
Hi, I'm Hannah.

302
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,430
Yes, you are my dear.
Can I have a hug?

303
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:54,100
You... you smell like cookies.

304
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,000
[laughs]

305
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,870
That is the best part of
a Ms. Benson hug.

306
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:01,840
I wish Mary were here
to see this.

307
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,610
The Darling family
back together again.

308
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:09,080
Isn't this great, Dennis?
Oh, well... he's off.

309
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:12,350
We can have a... cookie?

310
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:13,720
Mmm.

311
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:19,090
[laughing]

312
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:20,860
Uh, Julie was asking about you
last night.

313
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,590
Oh, really?

314
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,060
Yeah, you know. She just
wanted to know

315
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:25,700
if you had a date to
the winter ball yet.

316
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,230
Your wife and I go through this
ever year.

317
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:28,630
I know.

318
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:31,140
I told her you weren't gonna go,
but she can't help it.

319
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:32,800
She worries about you.

320
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,540
Worries?

321
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:38,440
What, that I'll get too much
peace and quiet in my life?

322
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,140
Yeah, I worry about you too.

323
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:43,810
Give me this.

324
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:45,380
But I know the real reason why
you're not going to the ball.

325
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:47,050
Oh boy, I can't wait
to hear this one.

326
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:49,750
You're afraid.

327
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,590
Afraid that I might show you up
on the dance floor.

328
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:55,430
Wow. Wow.

329
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:56,960
You know I never knew
why Julie married you,

330
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:59,330
but now I see it.

331
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:02,330
Like a moth to a flame,
my friend. Woo!

332
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:04,000
<i>Hannah: What are you looking at?</i>

333
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:06,770
Wait, what's up?

334
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:08,240
<i> Hannah: You did?</i>

335
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:11,810
You see it?

336
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:16,510
Huh. Liz Darling?

337
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,510
Yeah.

338
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:20,020
Hm. I heard she
got in yesterday.

339
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:22,120
You mean your wife told you
she got in yesterday.

340
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,990
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

341
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:25,590
And?

342
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:26,960
And what?

343
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,360
Just gave her a ride
from the ferry.

344
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,160
Oh, really? Huh.

345
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,630
Hold this, I'll be right back.

346
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:33,330
<i> Liz: Not too far, Hannah!</i>

347
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:36,100
Liz! Hey.

348
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,430
-Hi.
-Hi.

349
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:43,310
So, have you settled back
in to small town living yet?

350
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:44,810
Not quite.

351
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:46,780
My dad seems to think that
he's the one taking care of us

352
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,710
instead of the other
way around. So...

353
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:50,010
Oh yeah.

354
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:51,980
He's one tough cookie,
your old man.

355
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:53,520
Yeah.

356
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,320
All I wanted was to give Hannah
a good Christmas this year.

357
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,620
And instead I brought
her to the house where

Well, I hope you take a break
from the competition

a ball before.

a gallant prince

one of those.

to the ball?

still boycotting it?

once in high school,

he's never been back.

You guys talked about it a lot.

I never meant to lie to you
about the boat.

933
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,910
I wanted to get rid of it.
It hurt to look at the thing.

It's just that every time
someone made an offer

all I could think about was
about how we were never
gonna take that trip.

Why didn't you ask me
to come home

supposed to grieve for her

00:51:33,810 --> 00:51:35,440
Sure, I've had options.

1062
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:38,980
And?

1063
00:51:38,980 --> 00:51:40,480
And what?

1064
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:45,520
The right one just hasn't
come along yet.

1065
00:51:52,890 --> 00:51:54,560
We should get back to work.

1066
00:51:56,660 --> 00:51:58,360
Actually, I think we should
take a break.

1067
00:51:58,370 --> 00:51:59,530
Why?

1068
00:51:59,530 --> 00:52:01,670
I think our youngest sailor
needs one.

1069
00:52:01,670 --> 00:52:06,400
[groaning]

1070
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:09,510
I think I'm seasick.

1071
00:52:09,510 --> 00:52:11,480
The boat isn't even moving.

1072
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:13,750
It must be scurvy then.

1073
00:52:13,750 --> 00:52:14,880
That sounds serious.

1074
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:16,080
[laughs]

1075
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:18,320
Good thing I know just the cure.

1076
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:20,190
One hot chocolate
with extra whipped cream

1077
00:52:20,190 --> 00:52:22,390
should clear that scurvy
right up.

1078
00:52:22,390 --> 00:52:23,720
[giggles]

1079
00:52:24,830 --> 00:52:25,860
Mmm.

1080
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:30,560
Mom?

1081
00:52:33,330 --> 00:52:34,730
No way!

1082
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:40,170
Hannah, what are you doing?

1083
00:52:40,170 --> 00:52:43,070
Elves, Mom! Santa's elves
were right here!

1084
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:44,380
What?

1085
00:52:44,380 --> 00:52:46,510
Where do you think they went?

1086
00:52:46,510 --> 00:52:48,780
I think I might have an idea.
Come on.

1087
00:52:52,590 --> 00:52:54,250
Come on, Mom!

1088
00:52:54,250 --> 00:52:55,720
We haven't missed it.
Come on, get in there.

1089
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:57,290
-Ok.
-Come on, Mom.

1090
00:52:57,290 --> 00:53:00,260
Welcome, boys and girls and a
very merry Christmas to you all.

1091
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:02,030
All: Merry Christmas!

1092
00:53:02,030 --> 00:53:03,930
Hey, why aren't you
in the North Pole?

1093
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:08,130
Because, my friend, the big
man himself needs your help.

1094
00:53:08,140 --> 00:53:09,400
I don't remember this.

1095
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:11,300
It's new.
it started last year.

1096
00:53:11,310 --> 00:53:12,740
Shh!

1097
00:53:12,740 --> 00:53:14,040
<i> Elf: We need you to help</i>
<i> make sure</i>

1098
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:15,810
<i> everyone has an</i>
<i> amazing Christmas.</i>

1099
00:53:15,810 --> 00:53:16,940
Do you think you can help?

1100
00:53:16,940 --> 00:53:18,880
All: Yes!

1101
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:20,550
Come on, Santa needs us!

1102
00:53:20,550 --> 00:53:22,780
You're right. Santa needs us.
Let's go!

1103
00:53:22,780 --> 00:53:24,250
I'll be right here.

1104
00:53:24,250 --> 00:53:25,750
[laughs]

1105
00:53:26,090 --> 00:53:27,250
Hey.

1106
00:53:27,250 --> 00:53:29,290
Oh, hey, Dad. What
are you doing down here?

1107
00:53:29,290 --> 00:53:30,990
I was just coming back from
lunch with Joyce,

1108
00:53:30,990 --> 00:53:32,420
I thought I'd check and see

1109
00:53:32,430 --> 00:53:34,060
if Luke's mom was getting on
all right.

1110
00:53:34,060 --> 00:53:35,260
Oh.

1111
00:53:35,260 --> 00:53:38,400
-He worries, you know.
-Oh, he always has.

1112
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:39,800
Grandpa! Guess what?

1113
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:42,970
I'm an honorary elf. I'm gonna
help save Christmas.

1114
00:53:42,970 --> 00:53:44,240
Really?

1115
00:53:45,740 --> 00:53:48,140
Santa's list of non-perishable
donations.

1116
00:53:48,140 --> 00:53:50,140
This sounds like a very
important job.

1117
00:53:50,140 --> 00:53:52,140
It is, Luke's one too.

1118
00:53:52,850 --> 00:53:54,780
-Nice hat.
-Thank you.

1119
00:53:54,780 --> 00:53:56,410
Aren't you a little old
to be an elf?

1120
00:53:56,420 --> 00:53:58,080
It's never too late
for a career change.

1121
00:53:58,090 --> 00:54:00,090
Well, I hope you haven't
completely given up construction

1122
00:54:00,090 --> 00:54:03,150
because we have a lot of work
to do today.

1123
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:06,260
But Mom, Santa needs help
saving Christmas!

1124
00:54:06,260 --> 00:54:08,630
Oh, honey, I'm so sorry.

1125
00:54:08,630 --> 00:54:12,030
We have so much to finish
before the parade.

1126
00:54:12,030 --> 00:54:15,330
Hannah, why don't you come with
me and you guys go do your work?

1127
00:54:15,340 --> 00:54:16,330
Really?

1128
00:54:16,340 --> 00:54:17,800
If your mom says it's ok.

1129
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:21,110
Of course it's ok.

1130
00:54:21,110 --> 00:54:23,040
All right, Hannah.

1131
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:25,840
Hannah, I'm going to have
to go into early retirement.

1132
00:54:25,850 --> 00:54:26,710
Yeah.

1133
00:54:27,810 --> 00:54:30,980
Dennis, you are now one
of Santa's little helpers.

1134
00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:32,350
You're gonna need this.

1135
00:54:33,620 --> 00:54:34,950
And this.

1136
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:37,520
Good luck to you.

1137
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:39,190
-Come on, kid.
-Bye!

1138
00:54:39,190 --> 00:54:41,690
You call me if you
need anything.

1139
00:54:42,230 --> 00:54:43,800
He's never wearing that hat.

1140
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:45,500
It'll look great on him.
Yeah.

1141
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:46,670
[laughing]

1142
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:49,500
Just the two of us.

1143
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:52,570
Yes. And a boat.

1144
00:54:52,570 --> 00:54:54,310
-The boat.
-Yeah.

1145
00:54:54,310 --> 00:54:58,480
-The boat. Shall we?
-We shall.

1146
00:55:03,580 --> 00:55:04,920
Some choice.

1147
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:06,690
That's really what I said?

1148
00:55:06,690 --> 00:55:08,720
That I would never speak
to you again?

1149
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:11,960
Word for word.

1150
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:15,260
I don't know. That doesn't sound
like me.

1151
00:55:15,260 --> 00:55:16,730
Maybe you're remembering
it wrong.

1152
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:17,960
Nope.

1153
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:19,630
I've got the whole thing
stored up here.

1154
00:55:19,630 --> 00:55:22,230
The entire Liz Darling
encyclopedia.

1155
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:23,570
Oh really?

1156
00:55:24,470 --> 00:55:25,640
Try me.

1157
00:55:27,940 --> 00:55:29,470
Favorite band in high school?

1158
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:30,580
Pearl Jam.

1159
00:55:34,580 --> 00:55:36,150
Favorite food?

1160
00:55:36,150 --> 00:55:37,550
Coconut snowballs.

1161
00:55:42,220 --> 00:55:43,920
Favorite teacher?

1162
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:46,620
Mr. Kirby. The drama teacher.

1163
00:55:49,630 --> 00:55:51,460
High school crush?

1164
00:55:51,470 --> 00:55:53,630
Mr. Kirby. The drama teacher.

1165
00:55:53,630 --> 00:55:55,000
-No!
-Yes!

1166
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:58,340
[laughter]  I didn't tell anyone
that. Not even you.

1167
00:55:58,340 --> 00:55:59,770
Favorite color? Purple.

1168
00:55:59,770 --> 00:56:01,070
Greatest fear? Needles.

1169
00:56:01,070 --> 00:56:03,270
Favorite book?
The Secret Window.

1170
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:05,740
Face it, I know everything
about you.

1171
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:18,320
I bet you didn't know that I had
another high school crush.

1172
00:56:18,330 --> 00:56:21,360
Oh no, poor Mr. Kirby.
Who was it?

1173
00:56:23,830 --> 00:56:25,360
You.

1174
00:56:26,470 --> 00:56:29,270
-No you didn't.
-Yes, I did.

1175
00:56:29,270 --> 00:56:31,970
-No, you didn't.
-Yes, I did.

1176
00:56:31,970 --> 00:56:33,940
-No, you didn't.
-Yes, I did.

1177
00:56:33,940 --> 00:56:35,840
-No, you didn't.
-Fine. I didn't.

1178
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:36,980
Good.

1179
00:56:38,650 --> 00:56:39,710
Look out!

1180
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:41,650
Woah.

1181
00:56:42,780 --> 00:56:44,050
Woah.

1182
00:56:45,290 --> 00:56:49,820
Oh. Uh, thank you.

1183
00:56:49,820 --> 00:56:51,060
Yeah, no problem.

1184
00:56:51,060 --> 00:56:53,060
[exhales]

1185
00:56:54,390 --> 00:56:56,290
Hey, uh, listen.

1186
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:02,330
There's no way you had a crush
on me in high school.

1187
00:57:02,340 --> 00:57:04,040
Because I, uh...

1188
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:05,870
[phone ringing]

1189
00:57:05,870 --> 00:57:08,710
-Because if I'm honest, I...
-I have to get this.

1190
00:57:09,410 --> 00:57:10,710
Hello?

1191
00:57:14,750 --> 00:57:16,850
We make a good team, Grandpa.

1192
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:19,380
We sure do.

1193
00:57:19,390 --> 00:57:22,250
Excuse me, but we need to make
sure this gets delivered

1194
00:57:22,260 --> 00:57:24,760
to Mr. Claus as soon
as possible.

1195
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:27,160
Most people only pick one
of two items on the list.

1196
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:29,190
Yeah, well, my granddaughter
is very serious

1197
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:30,930
about Christmas spirit.

1198
00:57:30,930 --> 00:57:32,500
No kidding.

1199
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:34,200
Well, I can tell you one thing,

1200
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:36,530
if you two weren't on Santa's
nice list before,

1201
00:57:36,540 --> 00:57:38,400
you certainly are now.

1202
00:57:41,510 --> 00:57:44,910
Did you hear that, Grandpa?
You're on the nice list too!

1203
00:57:44,910 --> 00:57:47,110
Yeah, well that'll be
a nice change for me.

1204
00:57:53,090 --> 00:57:55,220
What's going on, kid?

1205
00:57:56,290 --> 00:57:59,260
How come you stopped wanting
to spend Christmas with us?

1206
00:57:59,260 --> 00:58:01,690
I like spending it with you.

1207
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:06,060
I like spending it with you too.

1208
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:14,640
Ah. It's just, Christmas is a
hard time of the year for me.

1209
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:17,380
Mom said it's because
you miss Grandma a lot.

1210
00:58:17,380 --> 00:58:20,580
Mm. That's true.

1211
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:22,250
But I don't understand.

1212
00:58:22,250 --> 00:58:24,880
If you miss Grandma,
and Mom misses Grandma,

1213
00:58:24,890 --> 00:58:28,490
wouldn't it just be better
if we all missed her together?

1214
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:33,590
Oh, god.

1215
00:58:33,590 --> 00:58:35,590
You're just like your Grandma,
you know that?

1216
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:36,960
-Really?
-Yeah.

1217
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:40,830
Kind, funny, clever as a whip.

1218
00:58:40,830 --> 00:58:42,770
She would love to be spending
time with you,

1219
00:58:42,770 --> 00:58:44,740
just like I am right now.

1220
00:58:54,110 --> 00:58:55,780
[giggles]

1221
00:58:55,780 --> 00:58:57,950
Ok, let's go. Let's go see what
your mom's up to.

1222
00:58:57,950 --> 00:58:58,850
Ok.

1223
00:58:58,850 --> 00:59:00,650
-Ok, here, come here.
-Woo!

1224
00:59:01,790 --> 00:59:02,820
Oh, yeah.

1225
00:59:04,490 --> 00:59:05,920
Onward!

1226
00:59:05,930 --> 00:59:07,630
Ok.

1227
00:59:07,630 --> 00:59:09,260
Wee!

1228
00:59:12,830 --> 00:59:15,130
I mean, you said it yourself.
It was a long shot.

1229
00:59:15,140 --> 00:59:16,970
I was wrong. All we have
to do is...

1230
00:59:16,970 --> 00:59:18,870
We did it!
We saved Christmas!

1231
00:59:18,870 --> 00:59:21,270
You did?! That was quick.

1232
00:59:21,270 --> 00:59:24,010
No time to waste when
your stakes are high.

1233
00:59:24,010 --> 00:59:25,710
Now I can help decorate again.

1234
00:59:25,710 --> 00:59:28,810
Good. 'Cause we need
all the help we can get.

1235

01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:50,190
And that beautiful
lady's being wasted,

1411
01:11:50,190 --> 01:11:52,860
just stuck at the marina
all year.

1412
01:11:52,860 --> 01:11:54,760
Nobody keeping her company.

1413
01:11:54,760 --> 01:11:56,560
But Mom loved that boat.

1414
01:11:56,560 --> 01:11:59,830
No, no kiddo.

1415
01:11:59,830 --> 01:12:02,330
No, it was never about the boat.

1416
01:12:02,330 --> 01:12:06,000
Or the decorations
for the parade.

1417
01:12:06,870 --> 01:12:16,380
Your mom loved you and... me.

1418
01:12:16,380 --> 01:12:18,250
For her it was all about us
spending time together

1419
01:12:18,250 --> 01:12:20,280
as a family.

1420
01:12:20,290 --> 01:12:23,450
And being the old fool I am,

1421
01:12:23,460 --> 01:12:27,890
I convinced myself that we
couldn't do that without her.

1422
01:12:27,890 --> 01:12:29,930
[chuckles]

1423
01:12:31,900 --> 01:12:34,870
But this past week, having you
here and getting to know that,

1424
01:12:34,870 --> 01:12:41,970
that amazing little girl,
that you're raising.

1425
01:12:41,970 --> 01:12:45,140
I'm just sorry.

1426
01:12:45,140 --> 01:12:51,980
I'm so sorry that we missed
all those Christmases.

1427
01:12:51,980 --> 01:12:54,790
I've missed you, Dad.

1428
01:12:54,790 --> 01:12:57,050
Oh, I missed you, kiddo.

1429
01:13:03,130 --> 01:13:06,430
Now, tell me what happened
between you and Luke tonight.

1430
01:13:10,670 --> 01:13:12,770
Not much to tell.

1431
01:13:12,770 --> 01:13:13,800
Just...

1432
01:13:18,010 --> 01:13:20,640
Just not meant to be,
I guess.

1433
01:13:25,620 --> 01:13:27,820
I'm gonna go tuck in Hannah.

1434
01:13:30,190 --> 01:13:33,120
-Good night, Dad.
-Good night, kiddo.

1435
01:13:38,260 --> 01:13:39,800
Hm.

1436
01:13:49,780 --> 01:13:51,140
Hello?

1437
01:13:52,510 --> 01:13:53,540
Who's there?

1438
01:13:55,150 --> 01:13:57,680

Oh, honey you scared me.

1439
01:13:57,680 --> 01:13:59,150
Sorry.

1440
01:13:59,150 --> 01:14:01,190
Why aren't you getting things
ready for the parade?

1441
01:14:01,190 --> 01:14:02,890
We finished yesterday.

1442
01:14:02,890 --> 01:14:04,960
So I thought I'd come help
out here.

1443
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:06,520
Well, I appreciate your help,

1444
01:14:06,530 --> 01:14:10,030
but wouldn't you rather spend
time with Liz while she's here?

1445
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:12,400
Uh...

1446
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:17,330
Luke?

1447
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:25,010
I told her how I feel.

1448
01:14:25,010 --> 01:14:28,010
I see. And?

1449
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:32,050
We realized it's just
not gonna work.

1450
01:14:35,090 --> 01:14:40,390
I mean, she's got her whole life
in Seattle

1451
01:14:40,390 --> 01:14:42,560
and I've got my
responsibilities here.

1452
01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:46,260
That hasn't changed.

1453
01:14:46,270 --> 01:14:50,600
You remind me so much
of your father.

1454
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:54,500
He was always making sacrifices
for other people.

1455
01:14:54,510 --> 01:14:56,910
Trying to take care
of the whole world.

1456
01:14:56,910 --> 01:14:57,740
Mom.

1457
01:14:57,740 --> 01:14:59,210
No, no, no, listen to me.

1458
01:14:59,210 --> 01:15:03,450
You stepped up when
this family was hurting.

1459
01:15:03,450 --> 01:15:07,050
And he would have been so proud
of the sacrifices you've made,

1460
01:15:07,050 --> 01:15:09,520
but I should have told you this
a long time ago.

1461
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:12,360
I don't need you to take care
of me anymore.

1462
01:15:12,360 --> 01:15:19,800
What I need is for you
to take care of yourself.

1463
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:23,430
So you have to decide
what you want.

1464
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:26,400
And what you're willing
to do for it.

1465
01:15:26,410 --> 01:15:28,110
I don't want you to spend
another second

1466
01:15:28,110 --> 01:15:31,480
with less love in your life
on my account.

1467
01:15:33,950 --> 01:15:37,410
And I can do all of this
on my own.

1468
01:15:39,390 --> 01:15:40,780
Yeah, you can.

1469
01:15:40,790 --> 01:15:42,790
Thank you very much.

I'd find you here.

your luck again.

Uh, is Liz around?

1474
01:16:03,480 --> 01:16:04,780
No, she and Hannah
went into town

1475
01:16:04,780 --> 01:16:07,340
to get provisions
for tonight.

1476

I was expecting.

What I'm wondering,
what I have always wondered

1483

is when are you going to do
something about it?

1484
01:16:43,880 --> 01:16:47,380
Well, actually that's...
that's why I'm here.

1485

need your help.

about it, ok?
