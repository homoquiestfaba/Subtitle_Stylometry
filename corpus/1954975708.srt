Greg giraldo, very simply,
was the real thing.

He had the respect
of real comedians.

19

compelling things about Greg

was that there's
an honest soul

inside of everything
he did.

25
00:00:59,604 --> 00:01:01,498

And I thought, wow,
that's how they tell you?

34
00:01:20,499 --> 00:01:22,498

this, like, supercomputer
that just wouldn't shut off.

36

all this stuff,

but it also tortured him.

38

and he'd find more
and more and more.

174
00:06:41,499 --> 00:06:43,499
- I'm pissing in the sink
because my crazy wife

175
00:06:44,499 --> 00:06:46,019
has locked herself
in our one bathroom,

176
00:06:46,044 --> 00:06:47,498
and she won't come out

177
00:06:47,499 --> 00:06:49,219
till I admit that I have
a drinking problem.

178
00:06:49,244 --> 00:06:51,498
Well, it's gonna be
a long wait, buttercup,

179
00:06:51,499 --> 00:06:53,498
so hang in there.

180
00:06:53,499 --> 00:06:54,498
I'll always do stand-up.

181
00:06:54,499 --> 00:06:57,498
My entire life is just trying
to fuel this stand-up monster,

182
00:06:57,499 --> 00:06:58,498
you know, come up with ideas

183
00:06:58,499 --> 00:06:59,498
and come up with things
to talk about.

184
00:06:59,499 --> 00:07:00,659
I can't imagine not doing it.

185
00:07:00,684 --> 00:07:02,498
But I also think
that once you stop,

186
00:07:02,499 --> 00:07:04,498
then you really stop
for good.

187
00:07:04,499 --> 00:07:06,498
This in-and-out thing,
is just, it's too painful

188
00:07:06,499 --> 00:07:07,498
to regroup and restart,

189
00:07:07,499 --> 00:07:10,499
and you gotta be in it
all the way.

190
00:07:13,409 --> 00:07:16,890
- The story of giraldo for me
was he was just a great guy.

191
00:07:16,891 --> 00:07:19,211
You know, I'd like to say,
oh, he was the guy of appetites.

192
00:07:19,236 --> 00:07:20,608
Boy, you saw this coming.

193
00:07:20,609 --> 00:07:21,608
It wasn't that way.

194
00:07:21,609 --> 00:07:25,608
He was all of us.

195
00:07:25,609 --> 00:07:27,608
- Greg's the oldest
of three of us.

196
00:07:27,609 --> 00:07:29,608
Myself, I was
the second child,

197
00:07:29,609 --> 00:07:32,608
and my sister Elizabeth
was the baby of the family.

198
00:07:32,609 --> 00:07:35,608
My dad was from Colombia,
my mother from Spain.

199
00:07:35,609 --> 00:07:37,608
Raised in queens, New York.

200
00:07:37,609 --> 00:07:39,608
Typical middle class.

201
00:07:39,609 --> 00:07:42,608
There wasn't anything
that would jump out at you

202
00:07:42,609 --> 00:07:43,689
as being anything,
you know,

203
00:07:43,714 --> 00:07:47,608
that led him into
some crazy world of comedy.

204
00:07:47,609 --> 00:07:48,608
- You are you?

205
00:07:48,609 --> 00:07:50,608
- Greg giraldo.

206
00:07:50,609 --> 00:07:52,129
- Okay, how long
you been doing comedy?

207
00:07:52,154 --> 00:07:53,608
- 35 years.

208
00:07:53,609 --> 00:07:55,608
No, it'll be two years
in march.

209
00:07:55,609 --> 00:07:57,608
- We both, I started
at the comedy cellar

210
00:07:57,609 --> 00:07:59,608
in the same way.

211
00:07:59,609 --> 00:08:02,608
And we were
just in the sort of,

212
00:08:02,609 --> 00:08:04,608
as comics come
in sort of classes

213
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:08,608
in little five-year clusters
like locusts.

214
00:08:08,609 --> 00:08:11,608
- Greg and I go back
to my first day in comedy.

215
00:08:11,609 --> 00:08:13,009
I walk in
and the first person I saw

216
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:16,608
is skinny, young Greg
in the corner of the club

217
00:08:16,609 --> 00:08:18,608
just sweating
like a nervous wreck.

218
00:08:18,609 --> 00:08:21,608
He was like
a wet squirrel.

219
00:08:21,609 --> 00:08:24,608
I mean, from that time
that we did that first show

220
00:08:24,609 --> 00:08:27,608
you just knew
there was no way about it

221
00:08:27,609 --> 00:08:28,608
we were comedians.

222
00:08:28,609 --> 00:08:29,608
- I actually heard
somebody the other day,

223
00:08:29,609 --> 00:08:31,169
he said, "these
illegal aliens come over

224
00:08:31,194 --> 00:08:32,608
"and take American jobs.

225
00:08:32,609 --> 00:08:34,608
They're taking away jobs
from Americans."

226
00:08:34,609 --> 00:08:35,608
Really?

227
00:08:35,609 --> 00:08:38,608
When's the last time you lost
a job to an illegal alien.

228
00:08:38,609 --> 00:08:40,608
You want to deliver
you own Chinese food?

229
00:08:40,609 --> 00:08:42,609
Is that a job you're
having trouble getting?

230
00:08:43,609 --> 00:08:45,289
Do you want to ride your
shitty little bike

231
00:08:45,314 --> 00:08:47,608
down Broadway in the rain?

232
00:08:47,609 --> 00:08:49,608
I used to hang out
at the open mics

233
00:08:49,609 --> 00:08:51,608
at, like, New York
comedy clubs and Gladys's

234
00:08:51,609 --> 00:08:53,608
just for fun, you know?
- For fun?

235
00:08:53,609 --> 00:08:55,608
- Yeah, just I would
hang out there.

236
00:08:55,609 --> 00:08:57,769
It was a good time, a lot of
my buddies would hang out.

237
00:08:57,794 --> 00:08:59,608
And I just thought, you know,

238
00:08:59,609 --> 00:09:04,608
I could never be as good
as everybody there, but, uh...

239
00:09:04,609 --> 00:09:06,608
[Laughs]

240
00:09:06,609 --> 00:09:07,608
- I remember seeing him one time
in a suit and tie,

241
00:09:07,609 --> 00:09:09,608
and I said,
"you look like a lawyer."

242
00:09:09,609 --> 00:09:11,608
And he was a lawyer.

243
00:09:11,609 --> 00:09:14,608
So, you know,
tip of the hat to me, huh?

244
00:09:14,609 --> 00:09:15,969
- We were just miserable
as lawyers

245
00:09:15,994 --> 00:09:17,608
and trying to figure out
how to get out.

246
00:09:17,609 --> 00:09:20,608
I remember him saying,
"I gotta do something I like."

247
00:09:20,609 --> 00:09:21,649
- During that time period,

248
00:09:21,674 --> 00:09:23,608
stand-up comedy was a career

249
00:09:23,609 --> 00:09:25,608
that did not have
a lot of openings.

250
00:09:25,609 --> 00:09:28,608
So I used to joke around
that it was like

251
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:31,608
pursuing a career
in phonograph repairman.

252
00:09:31,609 --> 00:09:34,608
- [Bleep]Ing Harvard lawyer.

253
00:09:34,609 --> 00:09:36,608
It was just like a joke.

254
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:38,369
It's like saying,
"oh, there's that comedian.

255
00:09:38,394 --> 00:09:40,608
He's also a brain surgeon."

256
00:09:40,609 --> 00:09:42,609
- You were a lawyer?
- I went to Harvard preschool.

257
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:43,810
- Well, here's
a Harvard lawyer

258
00:09:43,835 --> 00:09:45,608
who decided to do
what we do.

259
00:09:45,609 --> 00:09:47,608
All of a sudden we're all
a little bit more fancy.

260
00:09:47,609 --> 00:09:50,608
- I got arrested and spent
a night in jail in Virginia

261
00:09:50,609 --> 00:09:53,608
for drinking a beer
on the sidewalk.

262
00:09:53,609 --> 00:09:55,608
In New York I coulda been
drinking that beer

263
00:09:55,609 --> 00:09:56,769
out of the hollowed-out skull

264
00:09:56,794 --> 00:09:59,608
of something
I'd just decapitated.

265
00:09:59,609 --> 00:10:01,608
I coulda been standing
on the hood of a cop car

266
00:10:01,609 --> 00:10:02,729
mocking the officers
with it.

267
00:10:02,754 --> 00:10:04,608
"Cheers, big ears!"

268
00:10:04,609 --> 00:10:07,608
I coulda been doing funnels
out of this head's nostrils,

269
00:10:07,609 --> 00:10:09,608
and there would have been
no problems at all,

270
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,608
unless I was
illegally parked.

271
00:10:11,609 --> 00:10:12,649
You know, that--
[Laughter]

272
00:10:12,674 --> 00:10:16,608
- I got busted
for inciting a riot

273
00:10:16,609 --> 00:10:17,608
at this college gig.

274
00:10:17,609 --> 00:10:19,608
I had no money
for a lawyer.

275
00:10:19,609 --> 00:10:20,608
I was an opening act.

276
00:10:20,609 --> 00:10:22,608
You know,
I didn't want a record.

277
00:10:22,609 --> 00:10:24,369
He said, "yeah, I'll help you
get outta that.

278
00:10:24,394 --> 00:10:25,608
That's no problem."

279
00:10:25,609 --> 00:10:27,209
We each had our one good
suit and tie on,

280
00:10:27,234 --> 00:10:28,608
and Greg, like,
worked circles

281
00:10:28,609 --> 00:10:29,608
around some local judge.

282
00:10:29,609 --> 00:10:33,608
And he got my inciting
a riot case dismissed.

283
00:10:33,609 --> 00:10:37,608
And we were buddies
ever since then.

284
00:10:37,609 --> 00:10:38,769
- It was a ridiculous thought

285
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:40,769
that I could possibly ever
work in a regular job.

286
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:43,608
I just thought, you know, I'd
taken the lsats and all that.

287
00:10:43,609 --> 00:10:46,608
It went well, and going to law
school was fun enough I guess.

288
00:10:46,609 --> 00:10:48,608
But then trying to be
a real working lawyer

289
00:10:48,609 --> 00:10:51,608
was not an issue,
not an option.

290
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:53,608
I'm sitting here
about to perform

291
00:10:53,609 --> 00:10:55,608
in front of
a giant audience

292
00:10:55,609 --> 00:10:57,608
with my pants
electrical taped together.

293
00:10:57,609 --> 00:11:00,608
So imagine the kind
of lawyer I would be.

294
00:11:00,609 --> 00:11:01,608
I was on the subway
the other day.

295
00:11:01,609 --> 00:11:03,608
I saw these homeless guys
singing a capella.

296
00:11:03,609 --> 00:11:06,608
They were homeless and they were
singing a capella for money.

297
00:11:06,609 --> 00:11:09,608
How'd those guys
even meet?

298
00:11:09,609 --> 00:11:13,608
How do you bump into
other a capella enthusiasts

299
00:11:13,609 --> 00:11:15,608
when you're out there
on the homeless trail?

300
00:11:15,609 --> 00:11:17,890
You think they're just sitting
around the shelter one day.

301
00:11:17,891 --> 00:11:18,890
"I need some crack."

302
00:11:18,891 --> 00:11:20,608
♪ Me too, me three

303
00:11:20,609 --> 00:11:22,608
oh!

304
00:11:22,609 --> 00:11:24,608
- I can't ever remember,
like, looking back

305
00:11:24,609 --> 00:11:26,608
remembering Greg
when he was new.

306
00:11:26,609 --> 00:11:28,608
Even though he was new
when I saw him,

307
00:11:28,609 --> 00:11:30,608
he was just always
an awesome comic.

308
00:11:30,609 --> 00:11:31,608
- When you start out,

309
00:11:31,609 --> 00:11:35,608
you do a lot of dick
and midget and [Bleep] jokes.

310
00:11:35,609 --> 00:11:37,608
He was writing
topical stuff.

311
00:11:37,609 --> 00:11:39,608
He had, like, you know,
dirty, filthy stuff

312
00:11:39,609 --> 00:11:41,608
but really smart stuff.

313
00:11:41,609 --> 00:11:42,608
I fought that.

314
00:11:42,609 --> 00:11:45,609
I'm still doing the dick and
[Bleep] and midget stuff, okay?

315
00:11:46,609 --> 00:11:48,608
- Hilary Clinton
is probably gonna get indicted

316
00:11:48,609 --> 00:11:49,608
on whitewater charges.

317
00:11:49,609 --> 00:11:51,089
And because Clinton's
still president,

318
00:11:51,609 --> 00:11:52,608
he gets to decide whether
to pardon her or not.

319
00:11:52,609 --> 00:11:54,608
He gets to decide whether
to pardon his own wife.

320
00:11:54,609 --> 00:11:59,608
What an amazing relationship
bargaining chip that is.

321
00:11:59,609 --> 00:12:00,769
You know,
if you get to decide

322
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:02,330
whether your wife
goes to prison or not,

323
00:12:02,355 --> 00:12:04,608
who picks the movies then,
you know what I mean?

324
00:12:04,609 --> 00:12:05,608
- The way you can really
judge comedians,

325
00:12:05,609 --> 00:12:06,608
'cause you're not
gonna sit there

326
00:12:06,609 --> 00:12:08,608
and watch everybody's
stupid act your whole life,

327
00:12:08,609 --> 00:12:10,049
is going to the bathroom
just to pee.

328
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:11,450
Every time you walk
by the bathroom,

329
00:12:11,475 --> 00:12:12,608
you hear whoever's
on stage.

330
00:12:12,609 --> 00:12:14,129
And every time I walked
by hearing him,

331
00:12:14,154 --> 00:12:16,608
you're like, wow,
that was a great bit.

332
00:12:16,609 --> 00:12:18,608
Yeah, that's a great bit,
you know what I mean?

333
00:12:18,609 --> 00:12:20,209
Then you stay for
an extra minute or two.

334
00:12:20,234 --> 00:12:22,608
- We had both been doing it
for three, four years,

335
00:12:22,609 --> 00:12:25,608
and all of a sudden
we were on sitcoms.

336
00:12:25,609 --> 00:12:27,608
- I started in '92,
and then in '95

337
00:12:27,609 --> 00:12:29,608
I did the Montreal
comedy festival.

338
00:12:29,609 --> 00:12:30,608
There was an agent from L.A.

339
00:12:30,609 --> 00:12:31,608
That kind of discovered me,
or whatever.

340
00:12:31,609 --> 00:12:32,609
And it was kinda the days

341
00:12:32,634 --> 00:12:34,608
when you could still
do that, you know?

342
00:12:34,609 --> 00:12:36,209
If somebody saw you
and you were castable

343
00:12:36,234 --> 00:12:37,608
and had a story, you know,

344
00:12:37,609 --> 00:12:39,049
then you could just
go to Los Angeles

345
00:12:39,074 --> 00:12:41,608
and, you know,
tell your stupid story,

346
00:12:41,609 --> 00:12:42,608
and some executive
would give you money

347
00:12:42,609 --> 00:12:43,609
and develop a shitty show

348
00:12:43,634 --> 00:12:45,608
that would get cancelled
in three episodes.

349
00:12:45,609 --> 00:12:46,608
- 8:30!
Oh, my God.

350
00:12:46,609 --> 00:12:49,608
Oh, my God, what happened?
- Man, I don't know.

351
00:12:49,609 --> 00:12:51,608
We had a couple of bottles
of champagne,

352
00:12:51,609 --> 00:12:53,608
a few hours
of sexual gymnastics.

353
00:12:53,609 --> 00:12:55,608
If I had
to put a name on it,

354
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:58,608
I'd say we got caught up
in pope fever.

355
00:12:58,609 --> 00:12:59,608
I was [Bleep]ing awful in it.
I couldn't act.

356
00:12:59,609 --> 00:13:01,608
I stood there like,
what am I doing here?

357
00:13:01,609 --> 00:13:04,608
And I'd only done comedy
for about 2 1/2 years

358
00:13:04,609 --> 00:13:06,608
when the show got on the air,
so I was ridiculous.

359
00:13:06,609 --> 00:13:07,809
I was everything
that was wrong

360
00:13:07,834 --> 00:13:10,608
with the nature
of entertainment at the time.

361
00:13:10,609 --> 00:13:12,329
- And I think his lasted,
like, three weeks,

362
00:13:12,354 --> 00:13:13,608
and mine lasted, like, six.

363
00:13:13,609 --> 00:13:15,608
And then, you know,
then the next time I saw him,

364
00:13:15,609 --> 00:13:17,849
you know, we were working, like,
in a Chinese restaurant,

365
00:13:17,874 --> 00:13:19,608
going, "yeah, yeah,
this feels about right."

366
00:13:19,609 --> 00:13:21,009
[Laughs]

367
00:13:21,963 --> 00:13:24,643
- There's a fun competition
at a roast

368
00:13:24,668 --> 00:13:29,162
where you wanna have that--
that best joke, you know.

369
00:13:29,163 --> 00:13:33,162
And it's--it's good because
it keeps the bar high.

370
00:13:33,163 --> 00:13:35,162
- Greg would go on first,

371
00:13:35,163 --> 00:13:38,162
which obviously all the comics
are very jealous of

372
00:13:38,163 --> 00:13:41,162
because he gets to just,
you know.

373
00:13:41,163 --> 00:13:43,162
He'd say, "well, I have
to break the ice."

374
00:13:43,163 --> 00:13:45,323
You know, "I have to break--
I gotta do my own warm-up.

375
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:46,323
I gotta break the ice."

376
00:13:46,324 --> 00:13:48,162
He would crush the ice.

377
00:13:48,163 --> 00:13:50,162
- What a teeny little pimp.

378
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:51,283
Man, being a pimp
ain't easy,

379
00:13:51,308 --> 00:13:53,162
especially when you gotta
stand on phone books

380
00:13:53,163 --> 00:13:55,162
to smack a bitch.

381
00:13:55,163 --> 00:13:57,162
Kathy, you look like
Ronald McDonald

382
00:13:57,163 --> 00:13:59,162
[bleep]Ed Lucille ball's corpse

383
00:13:59,163 --> 00:14:00,683
then pushed it down
a flight of stairs.

384
00:14:01,163 --> 00:14:04,162
Lisa actually has a lot in
common with that octomom.

385
00:14:04,163 --> 00:14:06,163
She's never given birth,
but she has had 80 fingers

386
00:14:06,188 --> 00:14:08,162
inside her
at the same time.

387
00:14:08,163 --> 00:14:09,443
- Even, like,
the cable guy roast

388
00:14:09,468 --> 00:14:12,162
is arguably one of
the funniest ten minutes

389
00:14:12,163 --> 00:14:14,162
I think I've ever seen
anywhere ever.

390
00:14:14,163 --> 00:14:16,162
And I mean, like,
out of anything.

391
00:14:16,163 --> 00:14:20,162
It's just a [Bleep]ing tornado.

392
00:14:20,163 --> 00:14:22,162
You're like the trojan army.

393
00:14:22,163 --> 00:14:23,162
You're big, patriotic,

394
00:14:23,163 --> 00:14:25,162
and you both [Bleep] inside
a giant horse.

395
00:14:25,163 --> 00:14:30,162
You gravy-sweating
cousin [Bleep]er.

396
00:14:30,163 --> 00:14:33,162
Larry [Bleep]ed his first
cousin when he was 16.

397
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:35,162
And his last one
about an hour ago.

398
00:14:35,163 --> 00:14:37,162
- He would roast everything
about the person.

399
00:14:37,163 --> 00:14:42,162
You know, and eventually,
like, his real feelings

400
00:14:42,163 --> 00:14:44,162
could come through,
you could see, you know?

401
00:14:44,163 --> 00:14:47,162
He stopped making jokes at
a certain point and he said...

402
00:14:47,163 --> 00:14:51,162
- How the [Bleep]
are you so popular?

403
00:14:51,163 --> 00:14:52,162
[Laughter]

404
00:14:52,163 --> 00:14:54,162
Jesus [Bleep]ing Christ.

405
00:14:54,163 --> 00:14:56,163
This one finally
broke my back.

406
00:14:57,163 --> 00:15:00,162
- I think he really wanted Larry
the cable guy to answer him

407
00:15:00,163 --> 00:15:01,162
in some way.

408
00:15:01,163 --> 00:15:04,162
Bob saget, everybody.
Huh, Bob saget.

409
00:15:04,163 --> 00:15:06,162
- Greg's the first person
out of the gate,

410
00:15:06,163 --> 00:15:07,323
which is--
any good cockfight,

411
00:15:08,163 --> 00:15:09,363
you send out
your best rooster.

412
00:15:09,388 --> 00:15:11,162
And I'm just sitting there.

413
00:15:11,163 --> 00:15:14,162
And when I say cockfight...

414
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:17,162
- Who gives a shit
about Bob saget?

415
00:15:17,163 --> 00:15:21,162
Bob, you are a genital wart on
the [Bleep] of American culture.

416
00:15:21,163 --> 00:15:23,162
- And I'm looking
like I'm happy.

417
00:15:23,163 --> 00:15:25,162
But my posture's bad,

418
00:15:25,163 --> 00:15:28,162
and I was not, like,
overjoyed.

419
00:15:28,163 --> 00:15:30,162
And I was getting
mind raped.

420
00:15:30,163 --> 00:15:33,162
And everything he said
was right.

421
00:15:33,163 --> 00:15:35,162
- You are a vortex
of artistic compromise.

422
00:15:35,163 --> 00:15:38,162
Charlie sheen watches you
and feels good about himself.

423
00:15:38,163 --> 00:15:39,162
[Laughter]

424
00:15:39,163 --> 00:15:41,162
- The stage manager yells,

425
00:15:41,163 --> 00:15:45,162
"Joel wants you to sit up and
look like you're enjoying this."

426
00:15:45,163 --> 00:15:48,162
- No, just you looked
a little uncomfortable.

427
00:15:48,163 --> 00:15:49,162
- And I'm like, what?

428
00:15:49,163 --> 00:15:51,162
See, that's what I have
to contribute.

429
00:15:51,163 --> 00:15:53,162
It's not much.

430
00:15:53,163 --> 00:15:55,162
You should cut to
Sarah silverman right now.

431
00:15:55,163 --> 00:15:56,162
It'll be funny.

432
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:57,403
- You know,
a roast is something

433
00:15:57,428 --> 00:16:01,162
where you can be brutal
because it's with love.

434
00:16:01,163 --> 00:16:03,162
And it never occurs to me
that anyone might have

435
00:16:03,163 --> 00:16:05,162
actually ill feelings
towards me,

436
00:16:05,163 --> 00:16:08,162
which is I'm sure not true
but a great way to live.

437
00:16:08,163 --> 00:16:09,803
- Courtney, what the hell
happened to you?

438
00:16:09,828 --> 00:16:12,162
Your career dried up faster
than Sarah silverman's [Bleep]

439
00:16:12,163 --> 00:16:15,162
Around guys who can't
help her in the business.

440
00:16:15,163 --> 00:16:17,162
- We were in
the car together,

441
00:16:17,163 --> 00:16:19,243
and he was talking about
doing the flavor flav roast.

442
00:16:19,268 --> 00:16:21,162
And we just started
kinda riffing on it.

443
00:16:21,163 --> 00:16:24,162
And I think that's when it
kind of occurred to him

444
00:16:24,163 --> 00:16:26,162
that, like, oh, hey,
I think we could be good

445
00:16:26,163 --> 00:16:27,162
at that together,

446
00:16:27,163 --> 00:16:29,162
and the first joke
we kinda wrote was...

447
00:16:29,163 --> 00:16:31,162
- Ice-t,
you [Bleep]ing fossil.

448
00:16:31,163 --> 00:16:33,162
You're so old

449
00:16:33,163 --> 00:16:35,283
the first thing you bought
with your record deal money

450
00:16:35,308 --> 00:16:37,162
was your freedom.

451
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:38,162
[Laughter]

452
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:41,162
- And when ice-t threw his head
back and applauded

453
00:16:41,163 --> 00:16:42,203
about that
particular joke,

454
00:16:42,228 --> 00:16:44,162
I think everybody
kinda knew, like,

455
00:16:44,163 --> 00:16:45,162
oh, this is okay.

456
00:16:45,163 --> 00:16:48,162
- I've never roasted
an oily cadaver before.

457
00:16:48,163 --> 00:16:51,162
You're like a turd with teeth.
Look at yourself.

458
00:16:51,163 --> 00:16:53,162
I don't try so much
to be funny,

459
00:16:53,163 --> 00:16:55,162
as I just try to make
people uncomfortable

460
00:16:55,163 --> 00:16:58,162
and ideally raise a lot
of ugly truths.

461
00:16:58,163 --> 00:17:01,162
And try not
to shit myself.

462
00:17:01,163 --> 00:17:03,162
If I can get two outta three,

463
00:17:03,163 --> 00:17:06,162
I feel pretty good
about that.

464
00:17:06,163 --> 00:17:08,162
- We're a team.
We're a comedy duo.

465
00:17:08,163 --> 00:17:10,162
We're a duo.
- Did you have fun?

466
00:17:10,163 --> 00:17:12,162
- Oh, we're talking?
I'm posing for a [Bleep]ing--

467
00:17:12,163 --> 00:17:14,162
I'm posing for a still shot
like a douche bag.

468
00:17:14,163 --> 00:17:16,162
What am I,
a [Bleep]ing 90-year-old man?

469
00:17:16,163 --> 00:17:19,162
Hey!
Hey, all right.

470
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:20,563
- The first time
I was on the roast,

471
00:17:20,588 --> 00:17:23,162
I kind of, you know--
to me, my audience was Greg.

472
00:17:23,163 --> 00:17:26,162
Like, if I can
make him laugh,

473
00:17:26,163 --> 00:17:27,162
that's all that matters.

474
00:17:27,163 --> 00:17:30,162
- I think those roasts really
did help focus him,

475
00:17:30,163 --> 00:17:33,162
like, on, like,
on what he was good at,

476
00:17:33,163 --> 00:17:35,162
which is just, like, cutting,
really, really funny

477
00:17:35,163 --> 00:17:38,162
dirty-yet-clever jokes.

478
00:17:38,163 --> 00:17:39,163
- This woman the other day,
she had glitter on her chest.

479
00:17:40,163 --> 00:17:41,803
Glitter, and she catches me
glancing over.

480
00:17:41,828 --> 00:17:44,162
And she's like...

481
00:17:44,163 --> 00:17:48,162
You have shiny shit
on your tits.

482
00:17:48,163 --> 00:17:50,162
Were you hoping
to divert attention?

483
00:17:50,163 --> 00:17:52,162
That's not a great
strategy.

484
00:17:52,163 --> 00:17:54,162
You know, why don't
you hire a marching band

485
00:17:54,163 --> 00:17:55,763
to walk around you
with neon titty signs.

486
00:17:55,788 --> 00:17:57,162
[Imitating band playing]

487
00:17:57,163 --> 00:17:59,162
"What are you looking at?
What are you look--

488
00:17:59,163 --> 00:18:02,162
I'm up here.
Look me in the eyes."

489
00:18:02,163 --> 00:18:04,162
- The insomniac tour thing
was good

490
00:18:04,163 --> 00:18:06,323
'cause I got to pick some of
the comics who were on it.

491
00:18:06,348 --> 00:18:09,162
And one of them was Greg.

492
00:18:09,163 --> 00:18:11,162
- This guy looks funny though.
- This guy is good.

493
00:18:11,163 --> 00:18:13,162
- He actually looks funny.
- Thanks.

494
00:18:13,163 --> 00:18:15,323
- I thought he was an undercover
cop in a '70s TV show,

495
00:18:15,348 --> 00:18:16,162
but he's not.

496
00:18:16,163 --> 00:18:18,162
And Greg really
did me a solid.

497
00:18:18,163 --> 00:18:21,162
- After dinner, we go to
the make-your-own sundae bar,

498
00:18:21,163 --> 00:18:23,162
and we make sundaes
for each other.

499
00:18:23,163 --> 00:18:26,162
- Okay.
- Dane is sober,

500
00:18:26,163 --> 00:18:27,162
but the rest of us, like,
we were hard-core drunk.

501
00:18:27,163 --> 00:18:29,162
So, like, we definitely
coulda, like,

502
00:18:29,163 --> 00:18:31,162
tore through that town.

503
00:18:31,163 --> 00:18:32,162
- I was in
a restaurant recently.

504
00:18:32,163 --> 00:18:33,162
The waitress says,
"hey, gang, did you leave

505
00:18:33,163 --> 00:18:34,162
"any room for dessert?

506
00:18:34,163 --> 00:18:35,563
Did you leave any room
for dessert?"

507
00:18:35,588 --> 00:18:36,948
Did you leave any room
for dessert?

508
00:18:37,163 --> 00:18:38,162
How gluttonous
a concept is that?

509
00:18:38,163 --> 00:18:39,162
Is there any room left

510
00:18:39,163 --> 00:18:41,162
in your fat [Bleep]ing body
cavity for more?

511
00:18:41,163 --> 00:18:43,162
Did you leave any space?

512
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:44,162
Is there any physical way
we could cram more shit

513
00:18:44,163 --> 00:18:46,162
in your fat, bloated face,
you fat [Bleep]?

514
00:18:46,163 --> 00:18:48,162
Any chance at all?

515
00:18:48,163 --> 00:18:49,643
Any space in your
distended esophagus?

516
00:18:50,163 --> 00:18:51,843
We got dudes with plungers
that'll come out

517
00:18:51,868 --> 00:18:53,162
and cram it
right in your head.

518
00:18:53,163 --> 00:18:55,162
Any chance at all?
Won't that be neat, gang?

519
00:18:55,163 --> 00:18:56,643
Won't that be a great way
to celebrate

520
00:18:56,644 --> 00:18:58,643
your happy, Happy Birthday.
Happy, Happy Birthday.

521
00:18:58,644 --> 00:19:00,162
[Laughter]

522
00:19:00,163 --> 00:19:02,162
- When we did
the Vegas special,

523
00:19:02,163 --> 00:19:03,203
it was a lot
of temptation.

524
00:19:03,228 --> 00:19:05,162
But, you know, we were there
to do a job,

525
00:19:05,163 --> 00:19:08,162
and I think we did it.
[Laughs]

526
00:19:08,163 --> 00:19:09,162
- You rocked, and I'm not
just saying that.

527
00:19:09,163 --> 00:19:11,162
- Hey, suck-up, I'm over here.
It was my show.

528
00:19:11,163 --> 00:19:13,162
- No, you didn't do as well
as I expected.

529
00:19:13,163 --> 00:19:15,162
You, on the other hand,
kind of blew.

530
00:19:15,163 --> 00:19:16,323
- At one point
during his set,

531
00:19:16,348 --> 00:19:19,162
the fire alarm
in the casino went off.

532
00:19:19,163 --> 00:19:20,843
- These little [Bleep]ing
12-year-old girls

533
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:24,162
walking around with juicy--
[Alarm blares]

534
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,162
Holy shit.

535
00:19:25,163 --> 00:19:29,162
Wait, are we supposed
to be concerned, anybody, or--

536
00:19:29,163 --> 00:19:30,323
all the [Bleep]ing producers,

537
00:19:30,348 --> 00:19:32,162
the people in the sound truck
have driven off.

538
00:19:32,163 --> 00:19:34,162
It's just us
burning to death.

539
00:19:34,163 --> 00:19:36,162
- That's kind of fun
to, like, deal with

540
00:19:36,163 --> 00:19:37,162
for, like, a minute.

541
00:19:37,163 --> 00:19:40,162
But if kept going off
throughout his set,

542
00:19:40,163 --> 00:19:41,283
like over and over and over.

543
00:19:41,308 --> 00:19:43,162
So it was amazing
how he handled it.

544
00:19:43,163 --> 00:19:45,162
- How bad would that blow?

545
00:19:45,163 --> 00:19:47,162
I quit drinking, I'm in Vegas
without drinking,

546
00:19:47,163 --> 00:19:50,162
and then I die in a [Bleep]ing
fiery crash that day?

547
00:19:50,163 --> 00:19:52,162
- As a guy
who did drink heavily,

548
00:19:52,163 --> 00:19:54,162
I mean, I totally got it,

549
00:19:54,163 --> 00:19:55,603
and I knew
what he was going through.

550
00:19:55,628 --> 00:20:00,162
And few people know that,
like, he really did,

551
00:20:00,163 --> 00:20:02,162
um, try to get sober.

552
00:20:02,163 --> 00:20:03,162
I mean, he really did.

553
00:20:03,163 --> 00:20:05,162
But I think
in his head that, like,

554
00:20:05,163 --> 00:20:06,843
he was just too smart
for it all, you know?

555
00:20:06,868 --> 00:20:08,868
He really just
was too smart for it.

556
00:20:09,163 --> 00:20:11,162
- Say cheese!
- Oh, you got it.

557
00:20:11,163 --> 00:20:12,162
Nice!

558
00:20:12,163 --> 00:20:14,163
[Cheers and applause]

559
00:20:15,105 --> 00:20:17,304
- He was--
I hate to use the word

560
00:20:17,305 --> 00:20:19,304
given the circumstances
of what happened--

561
00:20:19,305 --> 00:20:21,304
but he was reliable.

562
00:20:21,305 --> 00:20:23,304
You know, watch him
on <i>tough crowd,</i> man.

563
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:26,304
Nobody came with more
prepared stuff than he did.

564
00:20:26,305 --> 00:20:27,304
- If you could choose to be gay,
why wouldn't we all do it?

565
00:20:27,305 --> 00:20:29,304
We would you put up
with the hassles

566
00:20:29,305 --> 00:20:30,304
of trying to get a woman
to have sex with you

567
00:20:30,305 --> 00:20:32,304
if you could just walk into
the steam room at the "y"?

568
00:20:32,305 --> 00:20:33,585
- You knew you could
rely on him.

569
00:20:33,586 --> 00:20:35,585
There would never be
nothing there, you know?

570
00:20:35,586 --> 00:20:37,304
- Or maybe there's
a nonviolent way

571
00:20:37,305 --> 00:20:38,745
to solve the whole
north Korea thing.

572
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:40,304
- Good thinking.
- There might be.

573
00:20:40,305 --> 00:20:42,304
They're asking for--what?

574
00:20:42,305 --> 00:20:44,304
- There's a nonviolent way
to solve a problem

575
00:20:44,305 --> 00:20:45,905
with a country that we hate
that hates us

576
00:20:46,305 --> 00:20:47,585
that's got weapons
pointed at us?

577
00:20:47,586 --> 00:20:49,026
I don't think so.
- No, you're right.

578
00:20:49,051 --> 00:20:51,304
Like, Russia, for example,
that big Russian war.

579
00:20:51,305 --> 00:20:54,304
There are things that--
there are things that--

580
00:20:54,305 --> 00:20:57,304
- with guys like Greg,
if you showed up not prepared,

581
00:20:57,305 --> 00:20:58,304
you'd get your head
handed to you.

582
00:20:58,305 --> 00:21:00,304
- This guy writes so many
jokes before the show

583
00:21:00,305 --> 00:21:02,304
it's not even funny.
It's unbelievable.

584
00:21:02,305 --> 00:21:03,465
He's got a pocketful of them.

585
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:05,304
- That's kinda what
we do here, Dennis.

586
00:21:05,305 --> 00:21:06,304
I'm a comedy writer.

587
00:21:06,305 --> 00:21:09,304
- It was Dennis leary
and Lenny Clarke.

588
00:21:09,305 --> 00:21:10,304
- I'm not coming back!

589
00:21:10,305 --> 00:21:12,304
- He was literally
attacking the king

590
00:21:12,305 --> 00:21:15,304
with the king's general
to his left.

591
00:21:15,305 --> 00:21:17,185
- I thought the whole idea
was just go out there

592
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:19,210
and sort of, you know,
spur-of-the-moment.

593
00:21:19,305 --> 00:21:20,585
And he was like,
"yeah, you know,

594
00:21:20,586 --> 00:21:21,585
but, you know, you wanna make
sure that you're funny."

595
00:21:21,586 --> 00:21:23,304
And I was like,
"I'm not writing--

596
00:21:23,305 --> 00:21:24,304
I didn't come here
to do homework."

597
00:21:24,305 --> 00:21:26,304
You're the guy in school
that did all the homework

598
00:21:26,305 --> 00:21:28,665
and then asked if there was any
more that needed to be done.

599
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:30,304
- Yeah, yeah.
That's a good point.

600
00:21:30,305 --> 00:21:31,304
And if you had tried
a little comedy writing,

601
00:21:31,305 --> 00:21:33,304
maybe your show would still
be on the air.

602
00:21:33,305 --> 00:21:34,304
- Oh!

603
00:21:34,305 --> 00:21:36,304
- I'm just saying.

604
00:21:36,305 --> 00:21:37,505
- It was like
that great moment

605
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:39,304
when two guys
are about to fight

606
00:21:39,305 --> 00:21:40,304
where they just both look
at each other

607
00:21:40,305 --> 00:21:41,304
and neither one's like--

608
00:21:41,305 --> 00:21:43,304
their eyes are just getting
opener and wider,

609
00:21:43,305 --> 00:21:44,304
like, you know.

610
00:21:44,305 --> 00:21:45,304
I thought they were just
gonna start fighting

611
00:21:45,305 --> 00:21:46,345
in the middle of the show.

612
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:48,304
- Meanwhile the host,
Colin Quinn,

613
00:21:48,305 --> 00:21:49,505
I mean, all he did
was actually

614
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:50,570
put his leg up
on the table

615
00:21:51,305 --> 00:21:52,545
that was in between
me and Greg.

616
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:54,304
That was like--
what was that?

617
00:21:54,305 --> 00:21:56,304
Like that was gonna
keep us separated

618
00:21:56,305 --> 00:21:57,625
if we decided to go at
each other?

619
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:00,304
Ooh, Colin's knee
is in the way.

620
00:22:00,305 --> 00:22:02,625
- This is a microcosm of why
war will never end right here.

621
00:22:03,305 --> 00:22:05,304
'Cause we can't even
get along.

622
00:22:05,305 --> 00:22:06,705
- No, no, no, [Bleep].
We're at war.

623
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:08,304
You and me, we're done.

624
00:22:08,305 --> 00:22:09,304
It was a great moment

625
00:22:09,305 --> 00:22:15,304
where I really, uh,
looked like a douche bag.

626
00:22:15,305 --> 00:22:17,304
And I felt bad.

627
00:22:17,305 --> 00:22:19,304
In Greg's defense,
he actually--

628
00:22:19,305 --> 00:22:21,304
he was very prepared
for almost anything

629
00:22:21,305 --> 00:22:23,304
that coulda happened.

630
00:22:23,305 --> 00:22:29,304
- I think my on-stage
persona is punkish.

631
00:22:29,305 --> 00:22:31,465
- People give him shit for not
having this huge career,

632
00:22:31,466 --> 00:22:32,586
but comics were always like,

633
00:22:32,611 --> 00:22:36,304
"oh, you know, comedy central
gives him everything."

634
00:22:36,305 --> 00:22:39,304
- Here's your host,
Greg giraldo!

635
00:22:39,305 --> 00:22:41,304
[Cheers and applause]

636
00:22:41,305 --> 00:22:44,304
- <i>Root of all evil.</i>

637
00:22:44,305 --> 00:22:46,304
He was, like,
automatically on the list

638
00:22:46,305 --> 00:22:50,304
just to see if he really

639
00:22:50,305 --> 00:22:53,304
was a Harvard lawyer.

640
00:22:53,305 --> 00:22:54,345
If strip clubs are so bad,

641
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:56,304
why are they called
gentlemen's clubs?

642
00:22:56,305 --> 00:22:58,304
- That's just another lie,
your honor.

643
00:22:58,305 --> 00:23:00,304
Gentlemen's clubs.
There's no gentlemen in there.

644
00:23:00,305 --> 00:23:02,304
You never hear things like,
"oh, I say, old man,

645
00:23:02,305 --> 00:23:04,065
"have you seen the nipples
on the enchantress

646
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:06,304
in the rubber thong?"

647
00:23:06,305 --> 00:23:07,385
- He was always on the side

648
00:23:08,305 --> 00:23:09,425
that was gonna
probably lose.

649
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:11,304
Which is part of the reason
we put him there,

650
00:23:11,305 --> 00:23:13,304
because he's the one
that would present the best

651
00:23:13,305 --> 00:23:15,304
and the funniest argument.

652
00:23:15,305 --> 00:23:16,745
- It's amazing
that we live in a time

653
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:19,304
where I use the same
machine to masturbate

654
00:23:19,305 --> 00:23:23,304
that I use to teach
my kids to spell.

655
00:23:23,305 --> 00:23:24,545
- He was a guy
we could count on

656
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:26,304
when we needed a great set
from somebody.

657
00:23:26,305 --> 00:23:28,304
He was the guy
we always thought of

658
00:23:28,305 --> 00:23:29,304
for particular shows
and pilots.

659
00:23:29,305 --> 00:23:31,304
Like, we want to find a way
to get him on there

660
00:23:31,305 --> 00:23:32,304
and give him a shot.

661
00:23:32,305 --> 00:23:35,304
We sorta considered him
a part of the family.

662
00:23:35,305 --> 00:23:37,304
- It's a comedy show
about sex.

663
00:23:37,305 --> 00:23:38,304
It'll be great.

664
00:23:38,305 --> 00:23:40,304
It's a topic everyone
can relate to.

665
00:23:40,305 --> 00:23:42,304
And it won't be gratuitous
or low-brow humor.

666
00:23:42,305 --> 00:23:44,304
I'm not talking about a bunch
of cheap sex jokes.

667
00:23:44,305 --> 00:23:45,465
I'm talking about
a smart look

668
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:47,304
at the state of sexuality

669
00:23:47,305 --> 00:23:48,585
in contemporary
American society.

670
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:51,304
Ah, [Bleep].

671
00:23:51,305 --> 00:23:53,304
So what do you think?

672
00:23:53,305 --> 00:23:55,304
- Whatever.

673
00:23:55,305 --> 00:23:56,425
- People always talked about

674
00:23:56,450 --> 00:23:58,304
that Greg had a ton of pilots
that didn't work.

675
00:23:58,305 --> 00:23:59,545
And, I mean,
I think that's true

676
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:01,304
of a lot of really
talented people.

677
00:24:01,305 --> 00:24:03,304
- As they say,
the cream rises to the top.

678
00:24:03,305 --> 00:24:06,304
And just because
the things that he did

679
00:24:06,305 --> 00:24:08,304
didn't necessarily
take off in the manner

680
00:24:08,305 --> 00:24:10,304
that I think they could have
or should have,

681
00:24:10,305 --> 00:24:13,304
it's not like he goes back
to the back of the line

682
00:24:13,305 --> 00:24:16,304
as a talented performer.

683
00:24:16,305 --> 00:24:18,304
- Comedians respect him.
Audiences respect him.

684
00:24:18,305 --> 00:24:20,304
The work is all there.

685
00:24:20,305 --> 00:24:22,304
It's digital.
It's on the Internet.

686
00:24:22,305 --> 00:24:24,304
There are people
on other planets

687
00:24:24,305 --> 00:24:26,304
watching him right now,
higher life-forms,

688
00:24:26,305 --> 00:24:28,304
deciding whether or not
to invade

689
00:24:28,305 --> 00:24:30,304
based on Greg's comedy.

690
00:24:30,305 --> 00:24:34,304
And that endures,
you know?

691
00:24:34,305 --> 00:24:35,304
Every once in a while

692
00:24:35,305 --> 00:24:36,304
there's a celebrity
checks into the hospital

693
00:24:36,305 --> 00:24:37,304
because she's exhausted.

694
00:24:37,305 --> 00:24:38,905
You always hear
they went in the hospital

695
00:24:39,305 --> 00:24:40,425
because they were exhausted.

696
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:43,304
How exhausted do you have
to be to go to the hospital?

697
00:24:43,305 --> 00:24:46,304
I mean, I've been
pretty damn tired.

698
00:24:46,305 --> 00:24:50,304
I just take
a little nappy-poo.

699
00:24:50,305 --> 00:24:51,385
And I wake up,
and I'm like,

700
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:53,304
"wow, cancel
the ambulance, honey.

701
00:24:53,305 --> 00:24:55,305
All better."

702
00:24:56,349 --> 00:24:58,648
- You know, everybody
has, like, a hook.

703
00:24:58,649 --> 00:24:59,648
You think, like,
people might have a hook

704
00:24:59,649 --> 00:25:00,809
in what makes them memorable.

705
00:25:00,834 --> 00:25:03,648
Like, with Greg, it was
always that he was smarter.

706
00:25:03,649 --> 00:25:05,648
- These reality shows,
they're getting so extreme.

707
00:25:05,649 --> 00:25:07,648
And they're all such copies
of everything else.

708
00:25:07,649 --> 00:25:08,648
How 'bout <i>the contender?</i>

709
00:25:08,649 --> 00:25:10,648
Everybody, ooh,
it's <i>the contender.</i>

710
00:25:10,649 --> 00:25:11,648
That's a great show.

711
00:25:11,649 --> 00:25:12,648
These shows
are [Bleep]ing soulless.

712
00:25:12,649 --> 00:25:14,089
And by the way,
we already had a show

713
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:15,089
where we went around
looking for the best boxer.

714
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:16,648
It was called boxing.

715
00:25:16,649 --> 00:25:18,648
I don't know
if you remember that show.

716
00:25:18,649 --> 00:25:20,648
It was a really good show,
boxing.

717
00:25:20,649 --> 00:25:22,648
- Yeah, there's too many
comedians out there

718
00:25:22,649 --> 00:25:23,648
that are just smart.

719
00:25:23,649 --> 00:25:24,649
Well, go be a scientist.

720
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:27,648
Smart and funny often means

721
00:25:27,649 --> 00:25:28,648
not that funny.

722
00:25:28,649 --> 00:25:32,648
And in Greg's case,
he was really [Bleep]ing funny.

723
00:25:32,649 --> 00:25:34,648
And he happened
to be really smart.

724
00:25:34,649 --> 00:25:36,648
- That whole thing of, like,
whether somebody's

725
00:25:36,649 --> 00:25:37,648
smart or not smart,

726
00:25:37,649 --> 00:25:39,648
you know, I'm not trying
to be a Professor here.

727
00:25:39,649 --> 00:25:41,648
I'm trying
to make people laugh.

728
00:25:41,649 --> 00:25:42,649
So that and also the fact

729
00:25:42,674 --> 00:25:45,648
that I have mommy issues

730
00:25:45,649 --> 00:25:48,648
I think is what drives me.

731
00:25:48,649 --> 00:25:51,648
- He had all of the qualities

732
00:25:51,649 --> 00:25:53,648
that a stand-up comedian
would want to have.

733
00:25:53,649 --> 00:25:56,648
Intelligent, good-looking,
integrity.

734
00:25:56,649 --> 00:25:59,649
He could have worked
off of his ethnicity.

735
00:26:00,649 --> 00:26:02,648
Never did.
He never did.

736
00:26:02,649 --> 00:26:05,648
- How dare you
not take the shortcut

737
00:26:05,649 --> 00:26:08,648
and talk about your people
for an hour

738
00:26:08,649 --> 00:26:10,648
every single night
of your life?

739
00:26:10,649 --> 00:26:11,648
- Most people find out
that I'm hispanic,

740
00:26:11,649 --> 00:26:12,648
they react the same way.

741
00:26:12,649 --> 00:26:15,648
Like, "wow, man, you don't
seem hispanic."

742
00:26:15,649 --> 00:26:17,649
They say it like
it's an enormous compliment.

743
00:26:18,649 --> 00:26:20,649
"You don't seem hispanic.
Seriously, you look good.

744
00:26:20,674 --> 00:26:22,648
Nice work."

745
00:26:22,649 --> 00:26:24,648
- When a comic
deals with a heckler,

746
00:26:24,649 --> 00:26:27,648
that's when you really see,
like, what they're made of.

747
00:26:27,649 --> 00:26:29,169
- Let's talk about
Keith Richards then.

748
00:26:29,649 --> 00:26:31,009
It's not really what
I had planned,

749
00:26:31,010 --> 00:26:32,250
but why don't
you talk about it?

750
00:26:32,275 --> 00:26:33,648
What exactly is the story?

751
00:26:33,649 --> 00:26:36,648
- He snorted dad.

752
00:26:36,649 --> 00:26:39,648
- Not so easy is it?

753
00:26:39,649 --> 00:26:41,648
Now imagine trying to do that

754
00:26:41,649 --> 00:26:44,648
with some [Bleep]ing drunk
screaming in your face.

755
00:26:44,649 --> 00:26:46,648
- When it would get bad,
I would love to watch him

756
00:26:46,649 --> 00:26:48,648
because he wouldn't
let them off the hook.

757
00:26:48,649 --> 00:26:50,649
- Is that person sleeping?

758
00:26:51,649 --> 00:26:53,049
There's a dude sleeping
dead center.

759
00:26:53,074 --> 00:26:54,648
That is [Bleep] great.

760
00:26:54,649 --> 00:26:56,648
- There was this guy
in the audience

761
00:26:56,649 --> 00:26:57,969
who was asleep
during the special.

762
00:26:57,970 --> 00:26:59,170
Like, he was, like,
passed out,

763
00:26:59,195 --> 00:27:00,648
like in the third row.

764
00:27:00,649 --> 00:27:02,648
And Greg just started
tearing into him.

765
00:27:02,649 --> 00:27:05,648
This was at the taping
for his hour special.

766
00:27:05,649 --> 00:27:07,129
- Doesn't strike you
as a weird choice

767
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:08,330
to fall asleep
in the third row

768
00:27:08,355 --> 00:27:10,648
of my big TV taping?

769
00:27:10,649 --> 00:27:11,769
I mean,
I'm all for sleeping.

770
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:13,769
I'm sure I'd be sleeping
watching you grow weed,

771
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:15,648
or whatever you do
for a living,

772
00:27:15,649 --> 00:27:18,648
but I--I'm just
trying to wonder

773
00:27:18,649 --> 00:27:20,648
why you would opt
for that.

774
00:27:20,649 --> 00:27:22,648
You know what I mean?

775
00:27:22,649 --> 00:27:24,648
- What's beautiful
about Greg

776
00:27:24,649 --> 00:27:28,648
is unrelenting belligerence
to someone that deserves it.

777
00:27:28,649 --> 00:27:30,648
[Laughs]

778
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:32,648
"Why you sleepin'?"

779
00:27:32,649 --> 00:27:36,648
"Me don't know.
Me got up early."

780
00:27:36,649 --> 00:27:39,648
- When you see a rerun
of one of Greg's specials

781
00:27:39,649 --> 00:27:41,169
or one of his appearances
on the roast,

782
00:27:41,194 --> 00:27:42,648
you forget he's gone.

783
00:27:42,649 --> 00:27:44,649
You watch it, and you feel
like he's still around.

784
00:27:45,649 --> 00:27:47,649
- Flavor flav!

785
00:27:48,649 --> 00:27:49,648
[Cheers and applause]

786
00:27:49,649 --> 00:27:51,648
- The flavor flav roast
was very special

787
00:27:51,649 --> 00:27:53,648
because it was a year
where there was a lot

788
00:27:53,649 --> 00:27:56,649
of racial humor
handled poorly.

789
00:27:57,649 --> 00:27:58,648
- I'm not gonna say
anything about flav

790
00:27:58,649 --> 00:28:00,648
that, uh, that hasn't
already been said

791
00:28:00,649 --> 00:28:02,648
by, uh, Michael Richards.

792
00:28:02,649 --> 00:28:05,648
- But the truth is,
racial humor like that,

793
00:28:05,649 --> 00:28:08,648
when handled by professionals
in the right environment,

794
00:28:08,649 --> 00:28:10,648
like the flavor flav roast

795
00:28:10,649 --> 00:28:12,648
can be epic.

796
00:28:12,649 --> 00:28:15,648
It can actually
bring people together.

797
00:28:15,649 --> 00:28:17,648
I remember flavor flav
in that big throne

798
00:28:17,649 --> 00:28:20,648
with that clock
and the smile,

799
00:28:20,649 --> 00:28:23,648
and he was like a little boy
and it was his birthday.

800
00:28:23,649 --> 00:28:26,648
You could not hurt
this guy's feelings.

801
00:28:26,649 --> 00:28:28,648
He laughed so much,
you would have thought

802
00:28:28,649 --> 00:28:29,969
he didn't even understand
English.

803
00:28:29,994 --> 00:28:34,648
- You are one black
mother[Bleep]er.

804
00:28:34,649 --> 00:28:37,648
You're like a skeleton
wrapped in electrical tape.

805
00:28:37,649 --> 00:28:38,648
You look like idi amin

806
00:28:38,649 --> 00:28:42,648
after a three-year crack binge
on the sun.

807
00:28:42,649 --> 00:28:46,648
- He was funny, and...
Nobody questions funny.

808
00:28:46,649 --> 00:28:48,648
You're not gonna get
a network call.

809
00:28:48,649 --> 00:28:51,648
When things are working,
everyone shuts up.

810
00:28:51,649 --> 00:28:55,648
Please welcome
the very funny Greg giraldo.

811
00:28:55,649 --> 00:28:57,729
- People always wanna compare
their dogs to your kid.

812
00:28:57,730 --> 00:28:58,729
You don't know what it's like
to have a kid

813
00:28:58,730 --> 00:29:00,648
'cause you have a dog.
First of all,

814
00:29:00,649 --> 00:29:02,849
nobody has a dog 'cause
they were too drunk to pull out.

815
00:29:02,874 --> 00:29:04,648
All right?
That's the first thing.

816
00:29:04,649 --> 00:29:06,648
- We had worked with Greg

817
00:29:06,649 --> 00:29:08,648
through <i>the late night show,</i>

818
00:29:08,649 --> 00:29:10,648
and he was just
the stand out.

819
00:29:10,649 --> 00:29:12,809
I thought, "let's try and think
of something for Greg."

820
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:14,648
- I'm Colombian.

821
00:29:14,649 --> 00:29:15,889
- Get a load of
the puerto rican

822
00:29:15,914 --> 00:29:18,648
trying to pass himself off
as Colombian.

823
00:29:18,649 --> 00:29:20,809
- What's the difference?
- A Colombian's a puerto rican

824
00:29:20,834 --> 00:29:22,648
with a job.
- I love it--

825
00:29:22,649 --> 00:29:26,648
the black guy
talking about jobs.

826
00:29:26,649 --> 00:29:29,648
- Greg wanted to play
a stand-up comedian.

827
00:29:29,649 --> 00:29:33,648
Which, of course, we were all,
you know, trepidatious about

828
00:29:33,649 --> 00:29:38,648
because Seinfeld had so famously
played a stand-up comedian.

829
00:29:38,649 --> 00:29:42,648
And comedy about comedy
is next to impossible.

830
00:29:42,649 --> 00:29:44,648
- We finished the pilot
and, you know,

831
00:29:44,649 --> 00:29:46,648
we were all so fired up.

832
00:29:46,649 --> 00:29:47,969
You know,
it ultimately didn't go,

833
00:29:47,994 --> 00:29:50,648
and I could tell that that
was another dagger for giraldo

834
00:29:50,649 --> 00:29:53,648
'cause it was another show
and another opportunity

835
00:29:53,649 --> 00:29:55,649
that should have happened,
and it didn't, you know?

836
00:29:55,674 --> 00:29:58,648
Greg was one of those guys
that even when the doors close

837
00:29:58,649 --> 00:30:00,648
and even when they said no

838
00:30:00,649 --> 00:30:02,969
and even when he got another
rejection, he just kept going.

839
00:30:02,994 --> 00:30:05,648
- <i>Last comic standing!</i>

840
00:30:05,649 --> 00:30:07,648
- Greg judging
<i>last comic standing,</i>

841
00:30:07,649 --> 00:30:09,648
I think was great for the show

842
00:30:09,649 --> 00:30:11,648
because of his
universal respect.

843
00:30:11,649 --> 00:30:13,648
- Uncle Mikey did heroin,

844
00:30:13,649 --> 00:30:15,169
which feels like
you're naked in a pool

845
00:30:15,194 --> 00:30:17,648
full of puppies...

846
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:20,648
- He was, I would say,
the Simon of the group.

847
00:30:20,649 --> 00:30:22,889
- Mike, you're always funny.
Your jokes are always funny.

848
00:30:22,914 --> 00:30:24,648
You're likable violent people.

849
00:30:24,649 --> 00:30:27,648
- You know, he would...
Tell it like it is.

850
00:30:27,649 --> 00:30:28,729
- From <i>last comic standing,</i>

851
00:30:28,754 --> 00:30:31,648
wild card Greg giraldo.

852
00:30:31,649 --> 00:30:33,648
- All season long I was like,
"we gotta get Greg.

853
00:30:33,649 --> 00:30:35,648
We gotta get Greg,"
and it wasn't until

854
00:30:35,649 --> 00:30:36,969
the final show
of the first season

855
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:38,050
that we finally got him on.

856
00:30:38,075 --> 00:30:40,648
And he sits there with
Gwyneth paltrow

857
00:30:40,649 --> 00:30:42,648
and Jerry Seinfeld
and just blows it open.

858
00:30:42,649 --> 00:30:45,648
He was poised, he was funny.
He stole the show.

859
00:30:45,649 --> 00:30:47,648
- You know, he's so happy.
His wife helps.

860
00:30:47,649 --> 00:30:49,648
You're so happy.
Gwyneth--oh, look at us!

861
00:30:49,649 --> 00:30:51,648
A rock star! [Mutters]
We're all happy!

862
00:30:51,649 --> 00:30:54,648
All we do is just look
into each other's eyes

863
00:30:54,649 --> 00:30:57,648
as we burn piles of money!

864
00:30:57,649 --> 00:31:00,648
- He liked the rock and roll
aspects to comedy.

865
00:31:00,649 --> 00:31:02,648
He would talk about comedy
like...Like he was

866
00:31:02,649 --> 00:31:04,648
the rolling stones.

867
00:31:04,649 --> 00:31:07,648
And I was like,
"I think we're like Bob Denver."

868
00:31:07,649 --> 00:31:08,849
So when stories
would come back

869
00:31:09,649 --> 00:31:11,009
and he was starting
to get mixed up

870
00:31:11,034 --> 00:31:12,648
or whatever was happening,

871
00:31:12,649 --> 00:31:14,648
I would always worry
about him for sure.

872
00:31:14,649 --> 00:31:17,648
And then--boom.
Then it hits you.

873
00:31:17,649 --> 00:31:18,648
I don't know.

874
00:31:18,649 --> 00:31:19,648
You know...

875
00:31:19,649 --> 00:31:23,648
There's not...There's not much
you can really say

876
00:31:23,649 --> 00:31:25,649
in those moments.

877
00:31:27,688 --> 00:31:29,987
- This homeless guy
asked me for money,

878
00:31:29,988 --> 00:31:31,308
and I was about
to give it to him,

879
00:31:31,309 --> 00:31:32,989
and then I thought,
"he's just gonna use it

880
00:31:33,014 --> 00:31:33,987
on drugs or alcohol."

881
00:31:33,988 --> 00:31:36,987
And then I thought, "that's
what I'm gonna use it on."

882
00:31:36,988 --> 00:31:40,987
- He was struggling with
both, uh, you know,

883
00:31:40,988 --> 00:31:43,987
addiction and--
and marriage, and, uh,

884
00:31:43,988 --> 00:31:45,108
gave him plenty of material.

885
00:31:45,133 --> 00:31:46,987
- Being married to a guy
would be great.

886
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:47,987
It would be great.

887
00:31:47,988 --> 00:31:49,987
Could you imagine
saying something

888
00:31:49,988 --> 00:31:51,148
and having the words you said

889
00:31:51,173 --> 00:31:52,987
interpreted exactly
the way that you intended

890
00:31:52,988 --> 00:31:54,987
your words to be interpreted?

891
00:31:54,988 --> 00:31:55,987
"Remember what you said
ten years ago

892
00:31:55,988 --> 00:31:57,188
"when you were driving the car

893
00:31:57,213 --> 00:31:58,987
on the way to my mother's
house?"

894
00:31:58,988 --> 00:32:00,308
"No."
"Oh, me neither! I'm a dude.

895
00:32:00,333 --> 00:32:01,987
Shit, never mind.
[Bleep] It..."

896
00:32:01,988 --> 00:32:03,987
- Greg had some anger,

897
00:32:03,988 --> 00:32:05,987
particularly
in the past couple years.

898
00:32:05,988 --> 00:32:07,987
Was saying stuff on stage
where I was like,

899
00:32:07,988 --> 00:32:10,987
"wow, I can't believe...
He's saying that."

900
00:32:10,988 --> 00:32:12,987
- "I hate you gotta go on the
road to get drunk all the time."

901
00:32:12,988 --> 00:32:14,987
"Well, I hate going
on the road too, my love,

902
00:32:14,988 --> 00:32:16,987
"but I'm just trying
to earn a goddamn living.

903
00:32:16,988 --> 00:32:18,428
"And if getting drunk
is the only way

904
00:32:18,453 --> 00:32:19,987
"I can anesthetize myself
enough

905
00:32:19,988 --> 00:32:22,987
"to entertain a bunch of freaks
I have nothing in common with,

906
00:32:22,988 --> 00:32:23,987
"I would have thought you,

907
00:32:23,988 --> 00:32:25,987
"as the woman who supposedly
loved me for who I am,

908
00:32:25,988 --> 00:32:26,987
would show me one [Bleep]ing
shred of compassion."

909
00:32:26,988 --> 00:32:28,987
"I wouldn't have married you
if I knew you were gonna

910
00:32:28,988 --> 00:32:30,987
"go on the road and get drunk
and work in night clubs.

911
00:32:30,988 --> 00:32:31,987
I wouldn't have married
someone like that."

912
00:32:31,988 --> 00:32:33,987
"Yes, you would have,
'cause that's how we met

913
00:32:33,988 --> 00:32:35,987
in the first place, remember?"

914
00:32:35,988 --> 00:32:36,987
- I mean, you could tell

915
00:32:36,988 --> 00:32:37,987
he was being personal
with every bit.

916
00:32:37,988 --> 00:32:39,987
That's what made him great
too, is like...

917
00:32:39,988 --> 00:32:41,308
He'd be talking about
Tiger Woods,

918
00:32:41,309 --> 00:32:43,308
but he's telling people
like this is about guys,

919
00:32:43,309 --> 00:32:44,987
my frustration.

920
00:32:44,988 --> 00:32:46,987
- 'Cause I was a loser nerdy
little golfer geek for years,

921
00:32:46,988 --> 00:32:47,987
and now I have access
to all these women,

922
00:32:47,988 --> 00:32:49,987
and it's very hard to just
turn that button off.

923
00:32:49,988 --> 00:32:51,987
I mean, I really want
to have sex with them.

924
00:32:51,988 --> 00:32:53,228
And it would mean nothing
to me.

925
00:32:53,253 --> 00:32:54,987
I love you and I love
our family,

926
00:32:54,988 --> 00:32:55,987
but occasionally I wanna
have sex with some women.

927
00:32:55,988 --> 00:32:58,148
It would mean nothing!
And I know you don't understand,

928
00:32:58,173 --> 00:32:59,987
'cause men and women
are different like that.

929
00:32:59,988 --> 00:33:01,948
Like I don't understand
a lot of things about you.

930
00:33:01,973 --> 00:33:03,987
Like I don't understand
how much you love shoes.

931
00:33:03,988 --> 00:33:05,987
But if hundreds
of free pairs of shoes

932
00:33:05,988 --> 00:33:07,987
showed up in your hotel room
every night,

933
00:33:07,988 --> 00:33:11,987
I guarantee you'd keep a pair
every once in a while.

934
00:33:11,988 --> 00:33:12,987
Thank you very much!

935
00:33:12,988 --> 00:33:14,987
- There's no preparation
you can go through

936
00:33:14,988 --> 00:33:19,987
to go from making a room
of 300 people laugh

937
00:33:19,988 --> 00:33:22,987
and then going home.

938
00:33:22,988 --> 00:33:24,987
- Well, everybody who drinks

939
00:33:24,988 --> 00:33:26,588
eventually starts talking about
drinking.

940
00:33:26,613 --> 00:33:28,987
I mean, I bought a house
off of it.

941
00:33:28,988 --> 00:33:29,987
- One time I was trying
to get on a plane.

942
00:33:29,988 --> 00:33:31,987
They wouldn't let me.
They said I was too drunk

943
00:33:31,988 --> 00:33:32,987
to get on a plane--
too drunk to get on the plane.

944
00:33:32,988 --> 00:33:34,987
Do you know how wasted
you have to be

945
00:33:34,988 --> 00:33:36,987
for someone to say,
"sir, you're just too drunk

946
00:33:36,988 --> 00:33:38,987
to sit in a seat."

947
00:33:38,988 --> 00:33:40,987
- Every time he went
on a binge,

948
00:33:40,988 --> 00:33:42,987
he would feel terrible
about it.

949
00:33:42,988 --> 00:33:44,987
Greg was a kind,
good person.

950
00:33:44,988 --> 00:33:48,987
So when he screwed up,
he felt bad about it for days,

951
00:33:48,988 --> 00:33:49,987
maybe weeks.

952
00:33:49,988 --> 00:33:52,987
He hated hurting his children.
He hated hurting his wife.

953
00:33:52,988 --> 00:33:54,987
He hated disappointing
people.

954
00:33:54,988 --> 00:33:56,987
But that addiction
just had him so--

955
00:33:56,988 --> 00:34:00,987
so badly that
he couldn't let go of it.

956
00:34:00,988 --> 00:34:02,588
- I do a lot of immoral
shit, believe me.

957
00:34:02,613 --> 00:34:05,987
But I lie about it,
and I cover it up...

958
00:34:05,988 --> 00:34:09,987
Because I'm a Christian
and...

959
00:34:09,988 --> 00:34:11,987
I have the decency to create

960
00:34:11,988 --> 00:34:14,987
a false sense of well-being
in my home.

961
00:34:14,988 --> 00:34:16,987
- The other craziest,
insidious thing

962
00:34:16,988 --> 00:34:18,987
about being an addict is
is that

963
00:34:18,988 --> 00:34:20,987
you trick everybody
around you into thinking

964
00:34:20,988 --> 00:34:21,987
that this is how it is
for now.

965
00:34:21,988 --> 00:34:23,987
And then you'll give everybody
a little window

966
00:34:23,988 --> 00:34:25,468
of, like, "see, look.
It gets better."

967
00:34:25,493 --> 00:34:28,987
- He was--had these moments
where he was clean

968
00:34:28,988 --> 00:34:30,588
for long spells,
and he was super-healthy

969
00:34:30,613 --> 00:34:31,987
and he was eating great.

970
00:34:31,988 --> 00:34:34,188
- You know, you sort of thought,
okay, he's gonna become

971
00:34:34,213 --> 00:34:35,987
a pathological vegetarian.

972
00:34:35,988 --> 00:34:39,987
Just talking about how "okra
really is a magical vegetable."

973
00:34:39,988 --> 00:34:42,028
- So everybody kinda thinks
he'll pull through this,

974
00:34:42,053 --> 00:34:43,987
you know, but...

975
00:34:43,988 --> 00:34:44,987
The body is fragile.

976
00:34:44,988 --> 00:34:47,987
Like there's only
so many times

977
00:34:47,988 --> 00:34:48,987
that you can cheat that.

978
00:34:48,988 --> 00:34:50,987
- If anything, if you were
gonna get the call,

979
00:34:50,988 --> 00:34:51,987
you were gonna be like,

980
00:34:51,988 --> 00:34:53,987
giraldo just went nuts
in a, you know,

981
00:34:53,988 --> 00:34:55,987
a juicer store.

982
00:34:55,988 --> 00:34:58,987
And you gotta bail him out
'cause he stole some radishes.

983
00:34:58,988 --> 00:35:02,987
- The rules for being
a gentleman

984
00:35:02,988 --> 00:35:06,987
used to be so specific
and nice, you know?

985
00:35:06,988 --> 00:35:11,987
- Somebody texted me saying.
"I just read on the Facebook

986
00:35:11,988 --> 00:35:14,987
that Greg giraldo overdosed."

987
00:35:14,988 --> 00:35:18,987
- I found out from, uh,
a text from tom papa.

988
00:35:18,988 --> 00:35:21,987
- I found out from...
Well, it was all--

989
00:35:21,988 --> 00:35:24,987
it was from the club owner
where he was performing.

990
00:35:24,988 --> 00:35:26,987
- I found out,
and I didn't believe it,

991
00:35:26,988 --> 00:35:28,987
because it was on Twitter.
[Laughs]

992
00:35:28,988 --> 00:35:31,987
- Nick swardson texted me
and he said,

993
00:35:31,988 --> 00:35:33,987
"what's going on
with Greg giraldo?"

994
00:35:33,988 --> 00:35:35,987
And I said,
"what are you talking about?"

995
00:35:35,988 --> 00:35:37,987
And he said,
"he's in a coma."

996
00:35:37,988 --> 00:35:39,228
- And I just remember
being mad,

997
00:35:39,253 --> 00:35:40,987
like, "come on, man,
what are you doing?

998
00:35:40,988 --> 00:35:43,148
You're too smart for this
stuff," and enough, you know?

999
00:35:43,173 --> 00:35:44,987
I didn't realize
how serious it was.

1000
00:35:44,988 --> 00:35:47,987
- When I went to go visit him,
I knew...You know.

1001
00:35:47,988 --> 00:35:49,988
I knew it was happening.

1002
00:35:51,988 --> 00:35:53,987
- I got it,
like a text message...

1003
00:35:53,988 --> 00:35:55,987
Just said, "Greg died."

1004
00:35:55,988 --> 00:35:59,988
Like typical...Nowadays,
you know, text message.

1005
00:36:01,988 --> 00:36:04,987
- When a comic leaves,

1006
00:36:04,988 --> 00:36:07,987
especially somebody
like Greg,

1007
00:36:07,988 --> 00:36:10,987
to me it's more than losing--
[Ahem]

1008
00:36:10,988 --> 00:36:12,468
Just like a friend
or somebody I knew.

1009
00:36:12,493 --> 00:36:14,987
It's like a part of you
because you know...

1010
00:36:14,988 --> 00:36:16,987
You know
what they went through.

1011
00:36:16,988 --> 00:36:18,987
I mean, you just--
you know that world, you know?

1012
00:36:18,988 --> 00:36:21,987
It's a very unique...
It's a very unique existence.

1013
00:36:21,988 --> 00:36:23,987
And it's one
that you share together.

1014
00:36:23,988 --> 00:36:28,988
Losing Greg was really...
Really, really hard.

1015
00:36:30,988 --> 00:36:35,987
- You know, I have nothing
but heartbreaking, now,

1016
00:36:35,988 --> 00:36:38,987
you know, loving, adoring

1017
00:36:38,988 --> 00:36:43,987
respectful, um,
feelings for him.

1018
00:36:43,988 --> 00:36:45,987
But I--there's also,

1019
00:36:45,988 --> 00:36:48,987
there's like a part of me
that just is like...

1020
00:36:48,988 --> 00:36:51,988
"What the [Bleep]?"

1021
00:36:54,988 --> 00:36:57,987
- I really do miss his, uh,
you know,

1022
00:36:57,988 --> 00:37:00,987
just knowing that he's there
and that I can call him.

1023
00:37:00,988 --> 00:37:02,987
You know,
like I just saw something

1024
00:37:02,988 --> 00:37:04,987
that I really wanna
tell Greg.

1025
00:37:04,988 --> 00:37:06,148
He'll think
this is hilarious.

1026
00:37:06,149 --> 00:37:07,429
And you know
there's nobody there

1027
00:37:07,454 --> 00:37:08,987
on the other end
of the phone.

1028
00:37:08,988 --> 00:37:10,148
- Any young comics coming up,

1029
00:37:10,173 --> 00:37:12,987
that's where you should
try to get to...

1030
00:37:12,988 --> 00:37:14,987
To try to be that real
on stage

1031
00:37:14,988 --> 00:37:17,987
and have observations
so acute and so original--

1032
00:37:17,988 --> 00:37:19,987
that's what you should
strive to be.

1033
00:37:19,988 --> 00:37:21,987
- India and Pakistan
have nuclear weapons.

1034
00:37:21,988 --> 00:37:23,987
How did they get
nuclear weapons?

1035
00:37:23,988 --> 00:37:25,987
They're--they're--
those are dirt poor countries!

1036
00:37:25,988 --> 00:37:27,987
Their armies don't even have
matching uniforms,

1037
00:37:27,988 --> 00:37:29,987
for Christ's sake.

1038
00:37:29,988 --> 00:37:31,788
They go to war,
they gotta call each other up:

1039
00:37:31,988 --> 00:37:34,988
[Accent]
"Wear something tough-looking."

1040
00:37:38,376 --> 00:37:40,675
- My life is so much
harder now

1041
00:37:40,676 --> 00:37:41,675
than it was when I was younger.

1042
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:42,675
I wanna be [Bleep] now
all the time, you know?

1043
00:37:42,676 --> 00:37:44,675
But I can't,
because now I'm an alcoholic,

1044
00:37:44,676 --> 00:37:47,675
and I can't drink at all
'cause when I do,

1045
00:37:47,676 --> 00:37:49,675
I end up snorting crystal meth
off a switchblade

1046
00:37:49,676 --> 00:37:51,675
in some after-hours bar
thinking,

1047
00:37:51,676 --> 00:37:54,675
[bleep] I'm gonna be late
for my flight in the morning.

1048
00:37:54,676 --> 00:37:56,675
Except it's like 2:00
in the afternoon,

1049
00:37:56,676 --> 00:37:58,675
and the flight
was six weeks ago.

1050
00:37:58,676 --> 00:38:00,675
You're like, "holy [Bleep],
how did that happen?"

1051
00:38:00,676 --> 00:38:03,675
- You can't try to, uh...

1052
00:38:03,676 --> 00:38:10,675
Dwell on the dark side
of Greg, because...

1053
00:38:10,676 --> 00:38:12,675
It wasn't why we loved him.

1054
00:38:12,676 --> 00:38:15,675
We loved him because
he was so generous

1055
00:38:15,676 --> 00:38:18,675
with his laughter
and his spirit and his mind

1056
00:38:18,676 --> 00:38:21,676
and the fact that he shared
his talent with us

1057
00:38:22,676 --> 00:38:25,675
and the fact that
he made us all look smarter

1058
00:38:25,676 --> 00:38:27,675
because he was this
cool Harvard lawyer

1059
00:38:27,676 --> 00:38:29,675
who decided to be a comedian

1060
00:38:29,676 --> 00:38:32,675
and then brought that
to the roasts.

1061
00:38:32,676 --> 00:38:35,675
And it was just like
a great mind and a great spirit

1062
00:38:35,676 --> 00:38:38,675
and...I just try
to think of him as...

1063
00:38:38,676 --> 00:38:40,675
The star that he is.

1064
00:38:40,676 --> 00:38:42,076
- Look at the things
we all believe.

1065
00:38:42,101 --> 00:38:43,675
Every religion's
got crazy stuff.

1066
00:38:43,676 --> 00:38:44,836
I'm catholic.
The virgin Mary.

1067
00:38:44,861 --> 00:38:46,675
We have a whole religion
based on a woman

1068
00:38:46,676 --> 00:38:48,675
who really stuck
to her story.

1069
00:38:48,676 --> 00:38:49,675
You know...

1070
00:38:49,676 --> 00:38:51,675
- He really elevated comedy,

1071
00:38:51,676 --> 00:38:55,676
and, uh, he made me proud
to be a comedian.

1072
00:38:56,676 --> 00:38:57,675
You know?

1073
00:38:57,676 --> 00:38:59,676
You look at Greg and, um...

1074
00:39:00,676 --> 00:39:02,675
And he made comedy
like a...

1075
00:39:02,676 --> 00:39:04,675
Admirable profession.

1076
00:39:04,676 --> 00:39:08,675
- I'm...Not sure I'm gonna
see anybody as good as Greg

1077
00:39:08,676 --> 00:39:10,675
in my go-round.

1078
00:39:10,676 --> 00:39:13,675
And that's depressing to me.

1079
00:39:13,676 --> 00:39:14,675
Like any comedian,

1080
00:39:14,676 --> 00:39:16,675
I've managed to make this
about me.

1081
00:39:16,676 --> 00:39:18,675
[Laughs]

1082
00:39:18,676 --> 00:39:21,675
This isn't about Greg.
This is about...How...

1083
00:39:21,676 --> 00:39:24,675
I don't get to book
Greg anymore.

1084
00:39:24,676 --> 00:39:27,675
- I hope he ends up, uh...

1085
00:39:27,676 --> 00:39:31,675
Known for more than being
just really great on roasts,

1086
00:39:31,676 --> 00:39:35,675
because that was really like
just in his pinkie.

1087
00:39:35,676 --> 00:39:38,036
- Right after he passed away
it was always like insult-comic

1088
00:39:38,037 --> 00:39:39,036
known for the roasts.

1089
00:39:39,037 --> 00:39:41,675
That just so minimizes
what he did.

1090
00:39:41,676 --> 00:39:43,675
- Anybody that knew his work,

1091
00:39:43,676 --> 00:39:46,675
the insult-comic
is the last thing

1092
00:39:46,676 --> 00:39:47,996
that would come out of
your mouth.

1093
00:39:48,021 --> 00:39:50,675
- He wasn't mean.
He just wasn't a mean guy.

1094
00:39:50,676 --> 00:39:53,675
He was, uh...He just really
had a good heart.

1095
00:39:53,676 --> 00:39:54,675
Really had a good heart.

1096
00:39:54,676 --> 00:39:56,675
- I don't know
if God cares or not.

1097
00:39:56,676 --> 00:39:58,836
I think there's some power
that's driving the universe,

1098
00:39:58,837 --> 00:39:59,836
but it laughs
when we [Bleep] up.

1099
00:39:59,837 --> 00:40:01,675
It laughs when you
walk into a glass wall

1100
00:40:01,676 --> 00:40:02,675
or, you know, every time
you're driving home,

1101
00:40:02,676 --> 00:40:04,675
trying to get to the bathroom
real fast

1102
00:40:04,676 --> 00:40:05,675
and you're almost there,

1103
00:40:05,676 --> 00:40:07,675
and you shit your pants
just a little bit.

1104
00:40:07,676 --> 00:40:09,675
Somebody's watching that.

1105
00:40:09,676 --> 00:40:11,675
And laughing.

1106
00:40:11,676 --> 00:40:13,675
- He was really going out there

1107
00:40:13,676 --> 00:40:15,675
like he was fighting
for his life.

1108
00:40:15,676 --> 00:40:17,716
There's part of you that's
being sucked into a hole,

1109
00:40:17,741 --> 00:40:20,675
and it's the fight
to get out of it

1110
00:40:20,676 --> 00:40:22,675
that, uh, is where
the comedy comes from.

1111
00:40:22,676 --> 00:40:26,675
There are people that...
They lose that fight.

1112
00:40:26,676 --> 00:40:28,516
- I don't know where
it all went off the rails.

1113
00:40:28,541 --> 00:40:29,675
I mean, I tried.

1114
00:40:29,676 --> 00:40:32,675
Drug addiction, alcoholism--
that probably didn't help.

1115
00:40:32,676 --> 00:40:35,675
But I think maybe
if I had just--

1116
00:40:35,676 --> 00:40:37,675
you know what I probably
should have done, really,

1117
00:40:37,676 --> 00:40:39,675
looking back on it?

1118
00:40:39,676 --> 00:40:41,675
I should have probably, uh,

1119
00:40:41,676 --> 00:40:43,675
committed to show business.

1120
00:40:43,676 --> 00:40:46,675
Because it's not show fun.
It's show business.

1121
00:40:46,676 --> 00:40:49,675

toward the Mike,

00:41:27,089 --> 00:41:29,088
and some guy goes,
"you suck! You suck!"

1133
00:41:29,089 --> 00:41:31,088
So I just snapped,
and I walked over,

1134
00:41:31,089 --> 00:41:32,088
I picked up a beer bottle,
and I poured beer all over him.

1135
00:41:32,089 --> 00:41:34,529
And he goes, "I'll [Bleep]ing

and he gets upall the [Bleep]

1137
00:41:37,089 --> 00:41:39,409
Then I get offstage, and he
had come back and wrote a note.

1138
00:41:39,434 --> 00:41:42,088
"You've been one of my
