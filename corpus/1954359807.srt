that he is a victim too.

But, we can't do that here.

1049
01:33:54,465 --> 01:33:56,990
We have to go.

1051
01:34:01,138 --> 01:34:03,265
Right.

- Here.
- Yeah.

1053
01:34:06,343 --> 01:34:08,402
Hold it.

Yes.

about to witness the destruction...

01:35:30,627 --> 01:35:36,395
of the evidence on
direct order of the General.

Everybody, out! Clear!

But these photographs are evidence.

01:36:31,054 --> 01:36:33,648
[ Man #2 ] This is awful.
These aren't terrorists.

1063
01:36:33,724 --> 01:36:36,887
- They're innocent people.
- [ Man #3 ] I'm with Gustavo.

Go ahead, but be careful.

1077
01:37:47,531 --> 01:37:50,625
This area is full
of terrorists.

1078
01:38:04,881 --> 01:38:09,045
[ Irene Narrating ] Francisco taught me
the meaning of love...

1079
01:38:09,119 --> 01:38:12,520
between a man and a woman,
for a family,

1080
01:38:12,589 --> 01:38:14,921
for a country.

1081
01:38:14,991 --> 01:38:18,950
Like his parents, Francisco
and I had to go into exile.

1082
01:38:19,029 --> 01:38:23,363
Like them we felt that whatever
the pain or suffering...

1083
01:38:23,433 --> 01:38:25,924
we could not allow the truth
to be buried.

1084
01:38:26,002 --> 01:38:31,235
Francisco had arranged our stay
at the Aguas Calientes Spa,

1085
01:38:31,308 --> 01:38:34,243
where I could regain
my strength.

1086
01:38:34,311 --> 01:38:36,745
The last part of our escape
to the border...

1087
01:38:36,813 --> 01:38:40,078
was to be on horseback.

1088
01:38:40,150 --> 01:38:43,881
- How do you feel?
- Better.

1089
01:38:43,954 --> 01:38:47,856
After ten days we were warned that
the military had picked up our trail.

- [ Man ] Who is that?
- [ Woman ] Oh, no.

1094
01:39:20,157 --> 01:39:23,718
[ Irene Narrating ] Francisco had told
Gustavo the truth about Evangelina...

1095
01:39:23,794 --> 01:39:27,355
and the hundreds
of innocent victims.

1096
01:39:27,430 --> 01:39:31,196
It wasn't until later that we heard
of Gustavo's ill-fated attempt...

1097
01:39:31,268 --> 01:39:35,671
to arouse the indignation of
the officers of his generation,

1098
01:39:35,739 --> 01:39:37,673
to overthrow the dictatorship.

1099
01:39:41,044 --> 01:39:45,344
Gustavo never breathed a word
about Francisco and me...

1100
01:39:45,415 --> 01:39:48,111
or our escape.

1101
01:39:52,422 --> 01:39:56,415
Francisco and I now planned
how best to tell the story...

1102
01:39:56,493 --> 01:39:59,758
of the lives entrusted
to our memory.

Good night, Chile.

1104
01:40:40,270 --> 01:40:42,363
The border is over there.

1105
01:40:54,818 --> 01:40:59,721
Francisco and I lived in exile
in Spain for 15 years.

1106
01:40:59,789 --> 01:41:03,225
As a result of our work and
that of hundreds of others...

1107
01:41:03,293 --> 01:41:07,286
fighting in the shadows to expose
the military dictatorship,

1108
01:41:07,364 --> 01:41:12,165
democracy was restored to Chile
peacefully in 1989.

1109
01:41:13,837 --> 01:41:17,034
Francisco and I were then able
to return to our homeland...

1110
01:41:17,107 --> 01:41:20,508
and to our families and friends.

1111
01:41:20,577 --> 01:41:23,944
Our first visit was
to lay flowers on the grave...

of Captain Gustavo Morante,
my gallant cousin.
