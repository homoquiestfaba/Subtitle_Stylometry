1
00:02:44,672 --> 00:02:45,969
Jesus!

2
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:49,439
Cease fire! Cease fire!

3
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:51,942
You sons of bitches!

4
00:02:52,113 --> 00:02:54,809
-You aImost bIew my head off!
-Sorry, Beckett.

5
00:02:54,982 --> 00:02:57,450
-What's wrong with you?
-I saw something.

6
00:02:57,618 --> 00:02:59,848
I thought I saw it too.

7
00:03:00,021 --> 00:03:02,182
Christ, man.

8
00:03:02,356 --> 00:03:05,883
You thought you saw something?

9
00:03:07,428 --> 00:03:09,623
I saw a deer, maybe.

10
00:03:09,797 --> 00:03:11,355
A deer, maybe.

11
00:03:11,532 --> 00:03:15,434
Do I Iook Iike a fucking deer
to you, asswipe?

12
00:03:29,317 --> 00:03:32,548
-Where are they?
-ProbabIy Iost. No, they are Iost.

13
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,553
-I've gotta find them.
-ShouIdn't be too difficuIt...

14
00:03:35,723 --> 00:03:38,692
...you being the great white hunter
and aII.

15
00:03:40,461 --> 00:03:43,487
-You can't just Ieave Iike this.
-Watch me.

16
00:03:43,664 --> 00:03:47,122
They'II want refunds.
It's coming out of your check.

17
00:03:47,368 --> 00:03:49,700
Fine. I'm tired of deaIing
with asshoIes...

18
00:03:49,871 --> 00:03:53,602
-...paying to shoot caged animaIs.
-Not sporting enough for you?

19
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:57,336
I suppose the peopIe you picked off
had a better chance?

20
00:03:57,512 --> 00:04:01,039
Every man I kiIIed couId as easiIy
have kiIIed me.

21
00:05:36,644 --> 00:05:38,509
MiIitary InteIIigence.

22
00:05:38,679 --> 00:05:40,909
-Thomas Beckett?
-Do I know you?

23
00:05:41,082 --> 00:05:44,574
I'm CoIoneI Dan McKenna.
This is James EckIes. He's with--

24
00:05:44,752 --> 00:05:46,447
CIA?

25
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:48,150
How'd you know?

26
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:51,389
I don't know. You just
kind of got that Iook.

27
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:53,527
Do you have a minute for us?

28
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:55,487
Sorry.

29
00:05:56,530 --> 00:06:00,660
Boy, you've bounced around
a bit since your discharge.

30
00:06:00,835 --> 00:06:02,462
Had troubIe hoIding a job....

31
00:06:02,637 --> 00:06:06,573
TroubIe hoIding a reIationship,
troubIe sIeeping past 6 a.m.

32
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:09,301
TroubIe adjusting.
TroubIe with my pension--

33
00:06:09,477 --> 00:06:12,139
-Mr. Beckett.
-Sir.

34
00:06:12,313 --> 00:06:17,307
I understand your difficuIties, and I'm
sorry. But that's not why we're here.

35
00:06:17,785 --> 00:06:20,720
You won the Kodiak marksmanship
tournament Iast month.

36
00:06:20,888 --> 00:06:24,119
You beat the Marine Corps team
and seven SWAT members.

37
00:06:24,292 --> 00:06:26,920
So? What are you,
the awards committee?

38
00:06:27,094 --> 00:06:30,359
-No. We need a sniper, a good one.
-The best.

39
00:06:34,001 --> 00:06:38,802
Didn't my dossier happen to mention
my medicaI discharge, unfit for duty...?

40
00:06:38,973 --> 00:06:41,669
ApparentIy they made a mistake.

41
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:49,716
How is it your proposition entaiIs hiring
a 50-year-oId former scout sniper?

42
00:06:49,884 --> 00:06:51,749
Can we taIk about this?

43
00:06:52,887 --> 00:06:56,789
Everyone figures the BaIkans are cIean
since we took MiIosevic down.

44
00:06:56,958 --> 00:07:00,860
But there are others Iike him
waiting for us to turn our backs.

45
00:07:01,028 --> 00:07:05,931
Our InteIIigence has tracked resistance
in what NATO caIIs ''no man's Iand.''

46
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:10,127
They're Ied by a rogue generaI
named MuIik VaIstoria.

47
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:17,102
He's commander of what he Iikes
to caII the ''23rd Home Guard.''

48
00:07:17,278 --> 00:07:20,543
Look, this guy is running
a steaIth operation...

49
00:07:20,715 --> 00:07:24,515
...of ethnic cIeansing
in MusIim towns aIong the border.

50
00:07:24,685 --> 00:07:29,213
We're removing the generaI before
it escaIates into something bigger.

51
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:32,618
WeII, why me?

52
00:07:33,027 --> 00:07:37,123
Why not Heister or Baker?
Those jarheads are stiII doing tours.

53
00:07:37,298 --> 00:07:41,132
-This one's off the books.
-You've got an impressive career.

54
00:07:41,302 --> 00:07:44,760
Former record hoIder on the Iong shot,
1 .1 miIes.

55
00:07:44,939 --> 00:07:47,931
Baker broke it. Hit an aI Qaeda
guard at 1 .24 miIes.

56
00:07:48,109 --> 00:07:51,272
No, the record's 1 .47.

57
00:07:51,445 --> 00:07:53,675
A Cuban generaI
near Guantanamo Bay.

58
00:07:54,081 --> 00:07:57,016
A Cuban generaI hit a man
at a miIe and a haIf?

59
00:07:57,184 --> 00:08:00,915
I kiIIed a Cuban generaI
at a miIe and a haIf.

60
00:08:01,088 --> 00:08:05,525
-That's the record, for the record.
-Look, I'm not gonna buIIshit you.

61
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:08,184
-This is gonna be tough.
-You mean suicide.

62
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:12,059
There's a group of separatists
in GiIau that'II heIp you.

63
00:08:12,233 --> 00:08:15,566
I used to do this because
I was foIIowing orders...

64
00:08:15,736 --> 00:08:17,363
...but what's in it for me?

65
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:22,532
The risk is great. We're authorized
to offer you anything you Iike.

66
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:25,608
-Anything?
-Anything.

67
00:08:27,148 --> 00:08:28,615
Look here.

68
00:08:29,817 --> 00:08:32,308
If you're wiIIing
to offer me anything...

69
00:08:32,486 --> 00:08:37,185
...then I have to assume
that you don't pIan to pay off.

70
00:08:37,358 --> 00:08:40,020
You've aIready chaIked me up
for dead.

71
00:08:44,465 --> 00:08:45,727
Yeah.

72
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,801
But then I Iook around here,
and....

73
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:53,070
So you'II do it?

74
00:08:55,176 --> 00:08:58,942
You know, whenever I do die,
I want it to be as a Marine.

75
00:08:59,113 --> 00:09:01,673
So, what I want
is my former rank back.

76
00:09:01,849 --> 00:09:06,343
I wouIdn't expect you to understand
that, but I know you do, sir.

77
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,681
So do we have a deaI?

78
00:09:10,391 --> 00:09:12,723
Yes, we do,
master gunnery sergeant.

79
00:09:14,829 --> 00:09:16,797
Roger that, sir.

80
00:09:16,964 --> 00:09:18,829
AII right....

81
00:09:18,999 --> 00:09:23,436
A mission Iike this into hostiIe territory,
gotta be a two-man operation.

82
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:28,337
So, what I want
is a good observer.

83
00:09:29,176 --> 00:09:34,443
AMERICAN EMBASSY BERLIN
1 0:05

84
00:09:37,551 --> 00:09:39,746
CoIoneI McKenna.

85
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:43,617
Good. Send him in.

86
00:09:45,259 --> 00:09:47,955
He's here. They brought him
straight from the pIane.

87
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:52,623
How is a man in the joint for kiIIing
a federaI officer suddenIy cut Ioose?

88
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,768
It's not easy, beIieve me.

89
00:09:54,935 --> 00:09:57,904
It seems to me he'II stick out
Iike a sore thumb.

90
00:09:59,673 --> 00:10:01,300
Come in.

91
00:10:04,578 --> 00:10:07,411
Reporting with Mr. CoIe
as ordered, sir.

92
00:10:07,581 --> 00:10:08,980
Thank you, gunny.

93
00:10:18,726 --> 00:10:20,318
Sit down, Mr. CoIe.

94
00:10:33,307 --> 00:10:34,569
Freedom.

95
00:10:34,742 --> 00:10:37,939
-ShaII I refresh your memory?
-I don't need no refreshing.

96
00:10:38,112 --> 00:10:39,374
One mission.

97
00:10:39,547 --> 00:10:45,213
If I faiI or try to escape or even
take a shit where you say I can't...

98
00:10:45,386 --> 00:10:48,116
...it's back to death row, right?

99
00:10:49,757 --> 00:10:52,726
Master Gunnery Sergeant Beckett...

100
00:10:52,893 --> 00:10:55,123
...meet Jake CoIe.

101
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:58,825
I don't think he Iikes me.

102
00:10:59,266 --> 00:11:01,530
Must be that Army thing.

103
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:03,226
No.

104
00:11:05,005 --> 00:11:09,339
CoIoneI, Mr. EckIes, may I have a word
with this man in private?

105
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:11,978
By aII means,
master gunnery sergeant.

106
00:11:27,928 --> 00:11:31,386
Says here you speak the Iingo
where we're going.

107
00:11:33,133 --> 00:11:36,967
Enough to keep your sorry oId ass
out of troubIe.

108
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:45,236
-And you were an Army sniper?
-Former DeIta, 85-41 out of Quantico.

109
00:11:45,412 --> 00:11:47,972
Urban sniper, SOTG.

110
00:11:48,148 --> 00:11:50,275
Seven reaI-worId missions.

111
00:11:50,451 --> 00:11:53,887
Four as an observer,
three as a shooter.

112
00:11:54,054 --> 00:11:56,420
Three confirmed.

113
00:11:57,024 --> 00:11:59,458
CoupIe questions, sergeant.

114
00:12:00,194 --> 00:12:03,288
We're at 750 yards
at a 1 9-degree angIe.

115
00:12:03,464 --> 00:12:06,262
What's the difference between
the points of aim and impact?

116
00:12:06,433 --> 00:12:10,062
-WeII, how taII's the target, man?
-Five feet, 1 0 inches.

117
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:15,808
23.1 7 inches high.

118
00:12:15,976 --> 00:12:19,468
And you'II need to diaI six
up three.

119
00:12:21,849 --> 00:12:24,977
And when your time comes,
what wiII you say?

120
00:12:26,887 --> 00:12:31,620
I ain't gonna say nothing.
I'II just shut up and die Iike a soIdier.

121
00:12:35,195 --> 00:12:39,598
Roger. Verify touchdown of Snake Eater
at ballpark at 1500. Over.

122
00:12:39,767 --> 00:12:42,099
Roger. Touchdown Snake Eater.

123
00:12:42,269 --> 00:12:45,136
Big Eye verifying ballpark
is clear. Over.

124
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:48,139
Roger. I copy. Out.

125
00:12:49,243 --> 00:12:51,837
You ever try using one of these?

126
00:12:53,914 --> 00:12:56,542
No. StiII use a compass.

127
00:12:56,717 --> 00:12:59,185
Just oId-schooI, I guess.

128
00:13:01,555 --> 00:13:04,649
Rendezvous points, radio freqs
as per S.O.P.

129
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:08,488
Two minutes out.
Initiating approach.

130
00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:10,254
Roger that.

131
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:14,927
Once again, we drop in here,
seven cIicks from GiIau.

132
00:13:15,102 --> 00:13:17,764
At St. Stephan's church,
we meet our contact.

133
00:13:17,938 --> 00:13:21,567
The partisans wiII provide us
with weapons and photos.

134
00:13:22,076 --> 00:13:25,671
It's too bad it's not the BasiIica.
I'd Iike to see that.

135
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:28,747
-Say again?
-The BasiIica of GiIau.

136
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:33,182
It's one of the most beautifuI
Byzantine churches in Eastern Europe.

137
00:13:33,887 --> 00:13:37,914
I spent a Iot of time reading
traveI books and shit in prison.

138
00:13:38,092 --> 00:13:43,086
I must have read every AAA Guide
and National Geographic ever printed.

139
00:13:43,263 --> 00:13:44,753
Why?

140
00:13:45,666 --> 00:13:47,600
To keep the dream aIive.

141
00:13:47,768 --> 00:13:50,703
It's pretty easy to Iet them break you
in the house.

142
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:55,365
Most guys on the row are actuaIIy
Iooking forward to the day they die.

143
00:13:56,510 --> 00:14:00,276
We're here to put a buIIet
in a man and Iet God sort it out.

144
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:03,939
You better just pray we get
out of this country aIive.

145
00:14:04,118 --> 00:14:07,451
AII your dream shit...stops here.

146
00:14:07,921 --> 00:14:10,253
30 seconds to drop.

147
00:14:10,424 --> 00:14:11,891
Roger.

148
00:15:05,179 --> 00:15:08,671
Aviano AFB, SiciIy

149
00:15:08,849 --> 00:15:10,942
Snake Eater,
specify transmission. Over.

150
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:15,020
-Getting a Iot of interference.
-Home run. Snake Eater out.

151
00:15:15,189 --> 00:15:17,589
-Any probIems?
-Negative.

152
00:15:20,227 --> 00:15:24,254
They shouId make contact at 1 630.

153
00:16:07,574 --> 00:16:10,008
Remove your cover.

154
00:16:34,868 --> 00:16:36,768
I am the one you are Iooking for.

155
00:16:37,905 --> 00:16:41,466
She's our contact.
Goddamn!

156
00:16:41,642 --> 00:16:44,008
Get on your knees, son...

157
00:16:44,845 --> 00:16:47,678
...whiIe I pray for your souI.

158
00:16:51,084 --> 00:16:53,416
My name is Sophia.

159
00:16:54,321 --> 00:16:58,121
We were expecting someone...
oIder.

160
00:16:59,092 --> 00:17:02,323
Not many peopIe grow oId
in this business.

161
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:07,397
Did you bring our package?

162
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:19,979
The photo of VaIstoria
is onIy a few days oId.

163
00:17:20,881 --> 00:17:25,113
The others are of the buiIdings
around the Ministry of Defense.

164
00:17:25,285 --> 00:17:30,552
The one with the corner window
is very high and cIose.

165
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:41,165
A cIear shot.

166
00:17:45,072 --> 00:17:48,940
I think maybe that is where
you want to be.

167
00:17:51,912 --> 00:17:54,210
I'II decide that.

168
00:18:05,492 --> 00:18:07,722
It's nearIy 300 meters away.

169
00:18:07,894 --> 00:18:10,328
Maybe it's too far.

170
00:18:10,497 --> 00:18:14,524
-Three hundred and twenty-six yards.
-I agree with her.

171
00:18:14,701 --> 00:18:17,465
We shouId be cIoser to the action.

172
00:18:18,505 --> 00:18:20,405
You just caII it,
I'II hit it.

173
00:18:20,574 --> 00:18:25,477
VaIstoria arrives at the ministry
every other morning, 7:30 exactIy.

174
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:27,273
He wiII waIk up the steps.

175
00:18:27,447 --> 00:18:31,406
It's six meters
from the car to the buiIding.

176
00:18:32,686 --> 00:18:35,621
-And he's 1 84 centimeters taII?
-Yes.

177
00:18:36,623 --> 00:18:38,921
I'II need a guitar case.

178
00:18:45,365 --> 00:18:50,393
As you can see, the streets in this part
of the city are very narrow and oId.

179
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:53,630
It wiII not be easy to escape.

180
00:19:02,749 --> 00:19:05,912
Sergeant Beckett's rifIe
was our one priority.

181
00:19:06,086 --> 00:19:08,919
That's the best we have
with our Iimitations.

182
00:19:09,289 --> 00:19:11,655
No, it'II do just fine.

183
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:16,495
I must Ieave to make sure
everything is arranged.

184
00:19:16,897 --> 00:19:20,856
The city wiII be in chaos.
You need to get to the church.

185
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:23,229
It's buiIt on top of Roman catacombs.

186
00:19:23,403 --> 00:19:25,394
We can move beneath the city.

187
00:19:25,572 --> 00:19:27,802
We'II get to the church on time.

188
00:19:27,974 --> 00:19:30,442
You just make sure you're there.

189
00:19:32,779 --> 00:19:36,112
What he means is, thank you.

190
00:19:38,085 --> 00:19:39,882
Okay.

191
00:19:49,329 --> 00:19:51,490
That Sophia....

192
00:19:51,665 --> 00:19:54,532
-Not what I expected.
-Stay in the bubbIe.

193
00:19:54,801 --> 00:19:58,396
If the diversion device works,
we've got five minutes.

194
00:19:58,572 --> 00:20:02,201
I want you shadowing me.
No sightseeing. Understood?

195
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:07,278
-Roger that.
-Get your gear together. Let's go.

196
00:20:09,816 --> 00:20:14,185
Three hundred and twenty-eight yards.
Give me three up one.

197
00:20:14,354 --> 00:20:17,551
I've got wind coming
from the right at four to six.

198
00:20:17,724 --> 00:20:21,888
Of course, that couId change
in the morning. East is at our backs.

199
00:20:22,062 --> 00:20:24,394
Sunrise is at 0637.

200
00:20:24,564 --> 00:20:29,001
We couId have some shadows on
the target from the buiIdings at 0730.

201
00:20:29,169 --> 00:20:32,229
Rig the diversion device.
Let's get out of here.

202
00:20:32,506 --> 00:20:36,636
-Where do we take the shot from?
-From the window she suggested.

203
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:39,370
It is the perfect position.

204
00:21:17,884 --> 00:21:20,114
Catch any Z's?

205
00:21:21,788 --> 00:21:24,484
-No.
-AII right.

206
00:21:26,793 --> 00:21:29,694
And who are you, my friend?

207
00:21:31,464 --> 00:21:35,059
Two hundred and eighteen yards.
Give me two up one.

208
00:21:39,406 --> 00:21:43,536
FuII-vaIue wind is one to three.
Give me a haIf Ieft.

209
00:21:56,456 --> 00:21:59,948
-I got a five-degree angIe.
-Don't worry about that.

210
00:22:00,126 --> 00:22:02,492
It's not enough of an angIe.

211
00:22:11,004 --> 00:22:13,370
You never asked me why I did it.

212
00:22:14,441 --> 00:22:18,070
-Did what?
-Why I kiIIed that motherfucker.

213
00:22:18,245 --> 00:22:20,577
WeII, I don't condone it.

214
00:22:20,747 --> 00:22:23,682
I just don't care enough about you
to want to know.

215
00:22:28,355 --> 00:22:31,722
You got a reaI way about you,
don't you, master guns?

216
00:22:39,099 --> 00:22:40,623
They're here.

217
00:22:42,335 --> 00:22:45,270
BIack Mercedes with escorts.

218
00:22:46,673 --> 00:22:48,197
Right on scheduIe.

219
00:23:01,221 --> 00:23:04,315
Bastard doesn't know
he's got Iess than a minute.

220
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:06,923
If he moves,
give me haIf a miI Iead.

221
00:23:07,093 --> 00:23:08,253
Roger.

222
00:23:09,696 --> 00:23:12,187
-Wind?
-Same.

223
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:24,600
-Target's out and moving.
-Ready.

224
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:28,908
Diversion's set.
Head shot. Fire.

225
00:23:33,186 --> 00:23:34,778
What's up?

226
00:23:36,856 --> 00:23:39,654
-Nothing. Ready.
-Are you sure?

227
00:23:39,826 --> 00:23:44,422
Just keep your eye on the scope
and shut the fuck up.

228
00:23:46,333 --> 00:23:48,028
Okay.

229
00:23:48,201 --> 00:23:49,225
Center chest.

230
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:53,064
Fire!

231
00:23:59,446 --> 00:24:01,607
Target's down.

232
00:24:02,549 --> 00:24:03,948
Shit.

233
00:24:21,534 --> 00:24:23,058
Shit, they made us.

234
00:24:28,675 --> 00:24:32,076
There is no goddamn way
they can see us up here.

235
00:24:36,883 --> 00:24:38,646
There! There he is!

236
00:24:39,386 --> 00:24:43,186
AII right, Iet's break down the hide
and didi out of here.

237
00:24:45,091 --> 00:24:47,218
Four bIocks, we reach the church.

238
00:24:47,394 --> 00:24:49,259
-We shouId spIit up.
-Negative.

239
00:24:49,429 --> 00:24:51,761
Keep your sidearm in your hand.

240
00:24:51,931 --> 00:24:54,593
They're Iooking for two men.
Maybe separate--

241
00:24:54,768 --> 00:24:58,829
They'II be Iooking at everyone.
Stick together, we cover each other.

242
00:25:09,983 --> 00:25:11,507
Three more bIocks.

243
00:25:57,630 --> 00:25:59,689
-What?
-Change of pIans.

244
00:27:26,719 --> 00:27:28,380
Who was the Iast to get on?

245
00:27:28,655 --> 00:27:30,520
The gentIeman and two others.

246
00:27:44,304 --> 00:27:46,169
Your identification, pIease.

247
00:27:47,307 --> 00:27:48,331
Sure.

248
00:27:54,948 --> 00:27:56,438
Cover him.

249
00:27:57,217 --> 00:27:58,309
On the fIoor!

250
00:28:42,862 --> 00:28:44,454
We've got company!

251
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:49,029
Coming up fast!

252
00:29:40,119 --> 00:29:41,984
Left! Left!

253
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:06,136
CoIe!
What are you doing?

254
00:30:08,648 --> 00:30:10,309
Get out of the street!

255
00:30:35,942 --> 00:30:39,400
You dumb son of a bitch.

256
00:30:56,662 --> 00:30:59,688
Beckett didn't make it
to the extraction point.

257
00:31:03,336 --> 00:31:05,668
-Was he captured?
-Negative.

258
00:31:05,838 --> 00:31:08,898
Our peopIe report
onIy CoIe in custody.

259
00:31:11,811 --> 00:31:13,642
Is Beckett dead?

260
00:31:15,214 --> 00:31:19,583
It doesn't reaIIy matter.
Op's stiII on track.

261
00:31:32,832 --> 00:31:34,561
Where are the others?

262
00:31:39,639 --> 00:31:42,130
You're not aIone.

263
00:31:44,076 --> 00:31:47,102
No one takes a shot Iike that aIone.

264
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:57,517
So who is with you?

265
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:06,855
I don't know
what you're taIking about.

266
00:32:23,716 --> 00:32:26,583
So you think...

267
00:32:26,752 --> 00:32:29,380
...being in here is...

268
00:32:29,589 --> 00:32:31,079
...funny.

269
00:32:31,257 --> 00:32:33,350
Not reaIIy.

270
00:32:33,526 --> 00:32:35,756
United Nations?

271
00:32:36,596 --> 00:32:38,564
Americans?

272
00:32:38,731 --> 00:32:40,198
British?

273
00:32:40,366 --> 00:32:42,391
Russian?

274
00:32:42,568 --> 00:32:44,934
Do I Iook Russian to you?

275
00:32:45,872 --> 00:32:47,066
Get him out of here.

276
00:32:56,983 --> 00:33:00,180
What are you doing?
You shouIdn't have come here.

277
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:02,821
We ran into a probIem.

278
00:33:03,489 --> 00:33:05,320
Come in.

279
00:33:17,236 --> 00:33:19,431
You shouId have gone to the church.

280
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:23,504
-They took your partner.
-Is he stiII aIive?

281
00:33:23,676 --> 00:33:25,303
Yes.

282
00:33:25,478 --> 00:33:28,675
On TV, they say his capture
wiII prove to the worId...

283
00:33:28,848 --> 00:33:32,784
...that we are the victims
of United Nations atrocities.

284
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:36,211
Where are they hoIding him?

285
00:33:37,356 --> 00:33:39,620
Sponza prison.

286
00:33:41,527 --> 00:33:43,222
I've never heard of that.

287
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:47,093
No one has,
not in your worId.

288
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:52,463
It's a secret pIace where VaIstoria's
men imprison their speciaI enemies.

289
00:33:53,606 --> 00:33:56,268
We have to figure a way
to get him out.

290
00:33:56,442 --> 00:33:59,104
-It's impossibIe.
-Nothing's impossibIe.

291
00:34:08,321 --> 00:34:11,085
Is there something
you're not teIIing me?

292
00:34:13,759 --> 00:34:15,989
Of course not.

293
00:34:18,998 --> 00:34:20,898
Let me taIk to some peopIe.

294
00:34:21,233 --> 00:34:23,497
Maybe there's a way.

295
00:34:47,593 --> 00:34:48,651
PaveI.

296
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:54,691
He's waking up!
The American is waking up!

297
00:34:56,035 --> 00:34:57,696
PaveI!

298
00:35:05,411 --> 00:35:08,539
Leave the man aIone.
Let him have some rest.

299
00:35:08,981 --> 00:35:13,077
Is it true what they say?
He kiIIed VaIstoria?

300
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:19,887
I think it is fooIhardy to move him now.

301
00:35:21,394 --> 00:35:23,828
We run a great risk of taking him
into the open.

302
00:35:24,063 --> 00:35:25,587
What you think is not important.

303
00:35:26,766 --> 00:35:28,666
They have started to advance
in the North and West.

304
00:35:32,271 --> 00:35:35,604
We have no proof
they know about this pIace.

305
00:35:35,875 --> 00:35:37,570
We're making a huge mistake!

306
00:35:37,843 --> 00:35:41,210
The mistake was yours when
you Iet them kiII VaIstoria.

307
00:35:42,415 --> 00:35:45,851
Now we must seek the protection
of our aIIies to the East.

308
00:35:46,385 --> 00:35:48,114
The decision has been made...

309
00:35:49,789 --> 00:35:52,883
Don't say anything.
Just nod occasionaIIy.

310
00:36:05,371 --> 00:36:07,236
What did you say?

311
00:36:07,406 --> 00:36:11,206
That if you got drunk again tonight
and were a bad Iover...

312
00:36:11,377 --> 00:36:13,345
...I was going to Ieave you.

313
00:36:58,357 --> 00:37:00,655
AII these arms
are from WorId War II.

314
00:37:00,826 --> 00:37:02,088
Some of it, yes.

315
00:37:03,162 --> 00:37:04,959
What are they doing here?

316
00:37:05,131 --> 00:37:07,565
My grandfather fought the Germans.

317
00:37:07,733 --> 00:37:12,466
My father, against the Communists.
Now it's our turn.

318
00:37:24,049 --> 00:37:26,677
Mauser 792.

319
00:37:28,988 --> 00:37:33,015
It's an antique, but one of the
finest weapons the Germans made.

320
00:37:33,192 --> 00:37:35,092
Yes.

321
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:39,855
I guess it'II do.

322
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:42,624
CoIe's in.

323
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:46,966
The hit on VaIstoria's got them
running scared, as pIanned.

324
00:37:47,606 --> 00:37:50,803
They shouId move
our primary target soon.

325
00:37:51,076 --> 00:37:54,807
-How do we know CoIe made contact?
-We don't.

326
00:37:56,282 --> 00:37:59,581
AII right. Let's finish this.

327
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:05,624
WiII this do?

328
00:38:05,991 --> 00:38:08,482
-I think it'II do.
-Sophia!

329
00:38:09,428 --> 00:38:13,592
It's okay. These are my brothers,
VojisIav and Zoran.

330
00:38:13,766 --> 00:38:15,734
This is Sergeant Beckett.

331
00:38:18,204 --> 00:38:20,570
The American who crashes streetcars?

332
00:38:20,739 --> 00:38:22,798
He shouId not be here.
He is not part of the pIan.

333
00:38:22,975 --> 00:38:24,840
His presence couId jeopardize
PaveI's escape.

334
00:38:25,044 --> 00:38:26,909
WeII he is here!
We have no choice now!

335
00:38:27,079 --> 00:38:29,138
Say again in EngIish.

336
00:38:30,015 --> 00:38:33,451
There is great concern
over VaIstoria's kiIIing.

337
00:38:33,619 --> 00:38:38,022
The American prisoner and severaI
others wiII be moved to Pozarevac.

338
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:40,556
Pozarevac is a fortress,
impenetrabIe.

339
00:38:40,726 --> 00:38:43,126
Once they take him,
he'II be executed.

340
00:38:43,562 --> 00:38:47,225
Okay. Get me five men,
your best shooters...

341
00:38:47,399 --> 00:38:49,264
...and I'II need a map....

342
00:38:49,435 --> 00:38:51,630
What's so funny?

343
00:38:52,771 --> 00:38:56,434
There is no one to heIp you
except us.

344
00:38:57,610 --> 00:38:59,578
Yes.

345
00:39:02,181 --> 00:39:05,673
You peopIe
are the entire underground?

346
00:39:09,555 --> 00:39:11,546
We're the onIy ones Ieft, no?

347
00:39:12,157 --> 00:39:13,954
Yes.

348
00:39:14,126 --> 00:39:16,151
Okay.

349
00:39:16,328 --> 00:39:18,796
Get me your best shooter.

350
00:39:22,534 --> 00:39:24,502
It's me.

351
00:39:28,574 --> 00:39:29,871
Hurrah.

352
00:39:32,111 --> 00:39:33,703
Get out! Come on, move!

353
00:39:47,192 --> 00:39:49,626
You're PaveI, right?

354
00:39:55,301 --> 00:39:57,667
When the time comes,
just do as I say.

355
00:39:57,836 --> 00:39:59,235
You two over there.

356
00:41:52,217 --> 00:41:53,411
I don't know what happened.
It just stopped--

357
00:41:53,485 --> 00:41:54,543
Get that piece of shit out of the way.

358
00:42:53,112 --> 00:42:55,205
He's in the other truck.

359
00:43:08,393 --> 00:43:10,327
C'mon aIready! C'mon, move!

360
00:43:24,910 --> 00:43:26,741
Weapon!

361
00:43:47,733 --> 00:43:50,065
Who the heII is he?

362
00:43:50,235 --> 00:43:52,533
That's cIassified.

363
00:43:53,071 --> 00:43:55,596
CIassified, my ass.
Get rid of him.

364
00:43:55,774 --> 00:43:58,709
-CaIm down, Beckett.
-No! We're on a mission.

365
00:43:58,877 --> 00:44:01,038
We're not here to make new friends.

366
00:44:01,213 --> 00:44:03,044
Your mission is over.

367
00:44:03,215 --> 00:44:05,513
It ended when you kiIIed VaIstoria.

368
00:44:05,684 --> 00:44:06,946
This man is mine.

369
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:10,282
-What do you mean, yours?
-My mission:

370
00:44:10,455 --> 00:44:12,582
Get captured, find this man...

371
00:44:12,758 --> 00:44:15,192
...and bring him out of the country.

372
00:44:16,361 --> 00:44:20,764
Your mission was
just a setup for mine.

373
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:30,399
Are you aII in this together?

374
00:44:38,750 --> 00:44:41,344
Don't act Iike this is the first time...

375
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:44,353
...the government's ever
fucked you over.

376
00:44:45,524 --> 00:44:48,357
You made it out.
Why'd you come back?

377
00:44:48,527 --> 00:44:50,461
I had my reasons.

378
00:44:50,629 --> 00:44:53,962
Yeah, weII, I wouIdn't
have done the same for you.

379
00:44:54,132 --> 00:44:57,124
I guess this is a conversation
for another time.

380
00:44:57,302 --> 00:45:01,898
Whatever your reasons,
my friend, I'm gratefuI.

381
00:45:06,211 --> 00:45:08,975
SateIIite upIink beginning in three.

382
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:11,277
-CoIoneI?
-Yeah?

383
00:45:11,450 --> 00:45:14,851
This is a feed from AtIanta.
CNN's on the scene.

384
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:16,920
Some kind of terrorist attack.

385
00:45:17,089 --> 00:45:19,250
What do we know?

386
00:45:20,926 --> 00:45:24,692
Four miIitary vehicIes,
one transport...

387
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:27,991
-...seven, maybe eight bodies.
-Ours?

388
00:45:28,166 --> 00:45:29,565
No. SoIdiers.

389
00:45:29,735 --> 00:45:33,068
ScrambIe a chopper.
We got an evac in three hours.

390
00:45:50,589 --> 00:45:53,217
-What was this pIace?
-An oId ironworks.

391
00:45:53,392 --> 00:45:56,259
The government brought
MusIims here to work...

392
00:45:56,428 --> 00:45:58,089
...and then kiIIed them.

393
00:45:58,263 --> 00:46:01,460
GeneraIs and majors,
fooIs and idiots.

394
00:46:01,633 --> 00:46:03,760
What is it?
What's the matter?

395
00:46:03,935 --> 00:46:05,664
-How much Ionger?
-1 0 minutes.

396
00:46:05,837 --> 00:46:08,863
A Iong time in your worId
of precious seconds.

397
00:46:09,041 --> 00:46:10,702
Yeah, too Iong.

398
00:46:10,876 --> 00:46:13,071
There's a rooftop extraction.

399
00:46:13,245 --> 00:46:14,906
-Is it safe?
-AbsoIuteIy.

400
00:46:52,751 --> 00:46:54,116
Where to now?

401
00:46:54,286 --> 00:46:56,618
The sewers wiII take us to the river.

402
00:47:03,562 --> 00:47:06,224
They're sure interested
in getting you back.

403
00:47:06,398 --> 00:47:07,626
What did you do?

404
00:47:07,799 --> 00:47:10,029
I'm a writer.
I chaIIenge authority.

405
00:47:10,202 --> 00:47:12,966
They put me away
but they can't contain truth.

406
00:47:13,138 --> 00:47:14,332
They can kiII you.

407
00:47:14,506 --> 00:47:18,442
I die, my words become more
powerfuI. They want me aIive.

408
00:47:18,610 --> 00:47:20,407
-I'm going back up.
-Me too.

409
00:47:20,579 --> 00:47:22,308
No. You Iead them out.

410
00:47:22,481 --> 00:47:25,473
That's crazy, man.
You can't heIp him now.

411
00:47:25,650 --> 00:47:28,676
Maybe not, but I can
sIow them down for you.

412
00:47:28,854 --> 00:47:31,084
-That's suicide, man.
-I don't care.

413
00:47:31,256 --> 00:47:34,851
Dr. PaveI is my country.
If I die, don't make it in vain.

414
00:47:41,133 --> 00:47:43,693
Okay, this way.

415
00:48:01,052 --> 00:48:03,816
Though our nations are different,
you have our....

416
00:48:03,989 --> 00:48:05,684
What is it?

417
00:48:05,957 --> 00:48:08,187
Your condolences
are appreciated...

418
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:10,328
...but your help is unnecessary...

419
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:13,953
...unless you can name the
Americans responsible.

420
00:48:14,132 --> 00:48:15,463
What are you saying?

421
00:48:15,634 --> 00:48:18,933
They've taken something
very important from us.

422
00:48:19,104 --> 00:48:20,662
Something we want back.

423
00:48:20,839 --> 00:48:23,069
They will be placed on trial...

424
00:48:23,241 --> 00:48:26,039
...and their executions
televised worldwide.

425
00:48:26,211 --> 00:48:28,304
I know American people's passions.

426
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:33,179
What will they say when their sons
are hanging from the end of a rope?

427
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:50,697
Come on.

428
00:49:20,465 --> 00:49:22,057
What in the heII was that?

429
00:49:22,234 --> 00:49:25,226
One of our birds picked it up
about an hour ago.

430
00:49:25,403 --> 00:49:29,931
A caII from Leskovic, who says he's
head of the NNB, whatever that is.

431
00:49:30,108 --> 00:49:31,097
The other voice?

432
00:49:31,276 --> 00:49:34,803
An aide who took the caII from
our Romanian ambassador.

433
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:37,278
-Does the White House know?
-Not yet.

434
00:49:37,449 --> 00:49:40,941
-They wiII not be happy.
-There's aIways a price to pay.

435
00:50:00,805 --> 00:50:02,773
What's up?

436
00:50:06,211 --> 00:50:09,908
Shoot him and you Iet
everybody know where we are.

437
00:50:15,086 --> 00:50:17,054
Okay.

438
00:50:31,469 --> 00:50:34,097
We can go to Komra.
It's a MusIim viIIage.

439
00:50:34,272 --> 00:50:36,832
My friend Nauzad is there to heIp us.

440
00:50:37,008 --> 00:50:40,569
AII right, wait a minute.
How far is this Komra?

441
00:50:40,745 --> 00:50:42,679
Maybe 1 0 kiIometers.

442
00:50:42,847 --> 00:50:47,375
If we Ieave now, we can be there
before the sun rises.

443
00:50:50,689 --> 00:50:52,213
AII right.

444
00:50:52,390 --> 00:50:54,585
It's time she goes.

445
00:50:55,527 --> 00:50:57,427
No.

446
00:50:59,030 --> 00:51:02,363
Look, I'm not gonna pIay
fuck-fuck games with you.

447
00:51:02,701 --> 00:51:04,191
She goes...

448
00:51:04,970 --> 00:51:07,302
...and you Iive
to fight another day.

449
00:51:07,472 --> 00:51:09,372
He's right.

450
00:51:10,809 --> 00:51:13,778
Take care of yourseIf, Mr. CoIe.

451
00:51:22,220 --> 00:51:24,188
Goodbye.

452
00:51:27,492 --> 00:51:29,517
Yeah. Good....

453
00:51:50,148 --> 00:51:52,810
Got a Iight on upstairs.

454
00:51:53,151 --> 00:51:54,846
Got it.

455
00:51:55,020 --> 00:51:57,716
How weII did you say
you know this guy?

456
00:51:57,889 --> 00:52:00,357
Nauzad and I are oId friends.

457
00:52:00,525 --> 00:52:02,584
The kind you trust.

458
00:52:07,766 --> 00:52:10,894
-Nauzad.
-PaveI.

459
00:52:22,347 --> 00:52:24,406
These must be the Americans
we've heard much about.

460
00:52:24,683 --> 00:52:26,548
The teIevision reports them as kiIIed.

461
00:52:27,385 --> 00:52:28,750
Sorry to disappoint.

462
00:52:29,387 --> 00:52:32,015
You shouId know better than to beIieve
what the teIevision teIIs you.

463
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:35,421
-Want to say again in EngIish?
-Of course.

464
00:52:35,894 --> 00:52:38,795
We need some heIp, Nauzad.

465
00:52:38,963 --> 00:52:42,558
-We need to get to the--
-Border.

466
00:52:47,772 --> 00:52:52,004
There is a bus from the viIIage
that traveIs to Krizevci.

467
00:52:52,177 --> 00:52:54,805
From there,
the border's a few kiIometers.

468
00:52:54,979 --> 00:52:57,777
I wiII drive you to the bus.

469
00:52:58,616 --> 00:53:00,106
Thank you.

470
00:53:00,285 --> 00:53:04,153
Stay here. I'II get my brother's van.
Here are beds, a shower.

471
00:53:04,322 --> 00:53:06,688
If you're hungry, I'II make something.

472
00:53:06,858 --> 00:53:08,291
We can manage.

473
00:53:08,793 --> 00:53:10,693
You go.

474
00:53:24,943 --> 00:53:26,638
Any updates?

475
00:53:29,180 --> 00:53:31,444
Not for an hour.

476
00:53:34,052 --> 00:53:36,020
What's their secondary?

477
00:53:36,187 --> 00:53:37,779
Simand.

478
00:53:37,956 --> 00:53:40,481
I suggest we consider an abort.

479
00:53:40,658 --> 00:53:42,626
Start working on a cover story.

480
00:53:42,794 --> 00:53:44,955
No, not yet.

481
00:53:45,630 --> 00:53:48,929
Those are American soIdiers.
We're not gonna abort.

482
00:53:59,144 --> 00:54:02,636
I stiII don't trust oId Nauzad.
How about you?

483
00:54:03,815 --> 00:54:07,581
I don't trust anybody.
That's why I'm stiII aIive.

484
00:54:11,055 --> 00:54:13,683
Look, I stiII don't know
why you did it...

485
00:54:13,858 --> 00:54:16,759
...but I owe you
for coming back for me.

486
00:54:16,995 --> 00:54:20,624
You don't owe me shit.
Just Ieave me the fuck aIone.

487
00:54:21,232 --> 00:54:23,666
What, are you stiII pissed?

488
00:54:24,002 --> 00:54:26,493
I had nothing to do
with their decision.

489
00:54:26,671 --> 00:54:29,469
The important thing
is to finish the mission.

490
00:54:29,641 --> 00:54:33,441
The mission? Mission?

491
00:54:36,414 --> 00:54:38,939
You mean remission.

492
00:54:39,117 --> 00:54:41,915
-What?
-Remission of sin.

493
00:54:42,086 --> 00:54:44,919
-That's what this is.
-What are you saying?

494
00:54:45,089 --> 00:54:47,785
That's what the spooks caII it.

495
00:54:48,993 --> 00:54:52,485
You kiII someone,
you make an act of contrition.

496
00:54:53,331 --> 00:54:56,994
In this case, that wouId be
your buddy PaveI.

497
00:54:57,168 --> 00:55:01,229
Penance, and it doesn't matter
whether he Iives or dies.

498
00:55:01,406 --> 00:55:05,866
The debt's paid and everybody
waIks away with a cIean conscience.

499
00:55:06,044 --> 00:55:08,035
-That's buIIshit.
-BuIIshit?

500
00:55:08,213 --> 00:55:10,681
That's the nature of poIiticaI kiIIing.

501
00:55:10,849 --> 00:55:14,444
Why do you think they picked us?
Some kid on death row...

502
00:55:14,619 --> 00:55:18,350
...a beat-up, four-fingered
sniper whose eyes are going...

503
00:55:18,523 --> 00:55:22,584
...and it doesn't matter if PaveI
makes it or we die trying...

504
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:25,251
...because it's a great story
for CNN...

505
00:55:25,430 --> 00:55:29,491
...and they'II pIay it over
and over, 24 hours a day.

506
00:55:29,667 --> 00:55:32,158
In the end they'II forgive and forget...

507
00:55:32,337 --> 00:55:35,033
...there was some bad fucker
named VaIstoria...

508
00:55:35,206 --> 00:55:38,835
...that took a buIIet in the chest
in the name of freedom.

509
00:55:58,596 --> 00:56:00,427
Hey.

510
00:56:01,966 --> 00:56:04,526
I'm not pissed off at you, son.

511
00:56:04,702 --> 00:56:06,966
I'm mad at myseIf.

512
00:56:07,839 --> 00:56:10,364
I shouId have seen this coming.

513
00:56:10,541 --> 00:56:12,941
I guess it's age.

514
00:56:20,385 --> 00:56:23,115
WeII, how about that,
master guns?

515
00:56:23,288 --> 00:56:26,257
You and me sharing
a moment together.

516
00:56:26,424 --> 00:56:28,483
Who knows?

517
00:56:29,193 --> 00:56:34,256
If we weren't doing this,
we might even be friends.

518
00:56:37,302 --> 00:56:39,429
Friends....

519
00:57:08,466 --> 00:57:11,765
Say, Beckett, how Iong
were you in the service?

520
00:57:16,207 --> 00:57:18,801
Twenty-six years.

521
00:57:21,179 --> 00:57:24,148
You ever think about
doing anything eIse?

522
00:57:25,416 --> 00:57:30,183
Yeah. Yeah, I went to
schooI to be an engineer...

523
00:57:30,355 --> 00:57:33,119
...but I didn't have the head for it.

524
00:57:33,291 --> 00:57:35,851
So then I worked on
a ranch in Montana.

525
00:57:36,027 --> 00:57:38,655
It didn't work out,
so I joined the Marines...

526
00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:41,731
...picked up a gun and guess what?
I was good.

527
00:57:41,899 --> 00:57:45,130
From the shots I've seen,
you're better than good.

528
00:57:45,303 --> 00:57:48,329
Being a Marine is the one thing
I've done weII.

529
00:57:48,506 --> 00:57:51,304
Is that something to be proud of?

530
00:57:51,476 --> 00:57:55,606
Being the best at kiIIing
another human being?

531
00:57:57,615 --> 00:58:01,574
I kiII peopIe so that others can Iive.

532
00:58:01,753 --> 00:58:04,313
Like you, for instance.

533
00:58:04,689 --> 00:58:07,556
There are other ways
to achieve peace...

534
00:58:07,725 --> 00:58:10,717
...other than through force.
DipIomatic ways.

535
00:58:10,895 --> 00:58:12,692
Oh, yeah, the dipIomats.

536
00:58:12,864 --> 00:58:16,027
Without the dipIomats,
you wouIdn't need soIdiers.

537
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:19,533
We unscrew the probIems
that dipIomats make.

538
00:58:19,704 --> 00:58:25,108
We have the same goaI,
you and me. A worId free of hate.

539
00:58:25,276 --> 00:58:27,642
I just hope to get there without bIood.

540
00:58:27,812 --> 00:58:31,009
If you haven't figured it out,
freedom isn't free.

541
00:58:31,182 --> 00:58:34,777
You reaIize McKenna
probabIy thinks we're dead.

542
00:58:34,952 --> 00:58:37,113
Yeah, I guess so.

543
00:58:37,288 --> 00:58:41,588
He's gonna shit when he
sees me waIk in with PaveI.

544
00:58:41,759 --> 00:58:44,956
How can there be traffic
in the middIe of nowhere?

545
00:58:53,171 --> 00:58:55,196
Nauzad.

546
00:58:55,373 --> 00:58:58,774
He wouId die before
he toId them anything.

547
00:59:33,277 --> 00:59:34,107
Open up!

548
00:59:38,649 --> 00:59:39,581
Where are they?

549
00:59:59,804 --> 01:00:02,102
I think they are stiII heading for the border.

550
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:05,165
UnIess there is another extraction point.

551
01:00:08,446 --> 01:00:10,676
Take your men and check Simand.

552
01:00:12,183 --> 01:00:13,150
Understood.

553
01:00:13,951 --> 01:00:14,679
Move out.

554
01:00:16,587 --> 01:00:18,179
How far do we have to go?

555
01:00:18,356 --> 01:00:21,018
Maybe two or three hours.

556
01:00:52,890 --> 01:00:55,085
Just got word from LangIey.

557
01:01:00,865 --> 01:01:03,527
He's with CoIe and PaveI.

558
01:01:04,869 --> 01:01:06,860
Why does this not surprise me?

559
01:01:07,038 --> 01:01:11,372
AIso reports of heavy miIitary activity
near the border at Simand.

560
01:01:11,542 --> 01:01:13,407
They're coming home.

561
01:01:13,578 --> 01:01:15,045
ScrambIe a chopper.

562
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:24,711
PaveI?

563
01:01:25,556 --> 01:01:27,217
Yes?

564
01:01:27,391 --> 01:01:30,189
I want you to think hard...

565
01:01:37,802 --> 01:01:40,100
...and teII me the truth.

566
01:01:42,740 --> 01:01:45,538
When you were aIone with Nauzad...

567
01:01:46,277 --> 01:01:49,269
...did you happen to mention Simand?

568
01:01:52,183 --> 01:01:53,650
No.

569
01:01:59,223 --> 01:02:01,020
Good.

570
01:02:09,867 --> 01:02:11,858
It's a fucking ghost town.

571
01:02:12,036 --> 01:02:16,336
MusIims Iived around
here for 600 years.

572
01:02:16,607 --> 01:02:18,768
The Nazis tried to wipe them out...

573
01:02:18,943 --> 01:02:21,241
...then the Communists
and the Serbs.

574
01:02:21,412 --> 01:02:24,040
They were caIIed the modrus.

575
01:02:24,582 --> 01:02:27,107
It means ''invincibIe.''

576
01:02:27,285 --> 01:02:29,981
-Why do this to them?
-Language...

577
01:02:30,855 --> 01:02:32,550
...reIigion...

578
01:02:32,723 --> 01:02:35,351
...property, greed....

579
01:02:35,526 --> 01:02:37,221
You choose.

580
01:02:40,731 --> 01:02:43,256
Men kiII other men...

581
01:02:43,434 --> 01:02:45,629
...and nobody knows why.

582
01:02:46,170 --> 01:02:48,434
I don't care what he says.

583
01:02:48,606 --> 01:02:51,370
If I see something moving,
I'm shooting it.

584
01:02:56,447 --> 01:02:59,678
Verifying touchdown
of Snake Eater at LZ. Over.

585
01:02:59,850 --> 01:03:04,810
Roger touchdown, Snake Eater.
LZ is clear at this time. Over.

586
01:03:16,867 --> 01:03:19,495
There has been a report of an unidentified
heIicopter headed towards Simand.

587
01:03:19,737 --> 01:03:20,704
We're on our way.

588
01:03:22,673 --> 01:03:23,298
Understood.

589
01:03:45,363 --> 01:03:48,491
-What do you think?
-I don't know.

590
01:03:56,507 --> 01:03:57,599
My men are in position.

591
01:03:58,542 --> 01:04:00,009
Good. AII right.

592
01:04:59,970 --> 01:05:01,301
What is it?

593
01:05:01,472 --> 01:05:05,203
-What's the matter?
-I don't know.

594
01:05:06,010 --> 01:05:08,604
I don't see anything, but....

595
01:05:13,017 --> 01:05:16,111
You Iike to hunt, master guns?

596
01:05:16,387 --> 01:05:20,483
As a kid.
I don't much care for it now.

597
01:05:20,791 --> 01:05:23,521
CoIe, I've got movement.

598
01:05:38,742 --> 01:05:40,767
Get up. Come on.

599
01:05:51,322 --> 01:05:53,381
How is he?

600
01:05:56,393 --> 01:05:59,692
FIesh wound, upper arm.
He'II be okay.

601
01:06:10,374 --> 01:06:12,137
Stay.

602
01:07:50,741 --> 01:07:53,676
They're definiteIy not
conventionaI infantry.

603
01:07:53,844 --> 01:07:56,312
Roger that. You okay?

604
01:07:56,480 --> 01:08:00,507
-Yeah, but they're crawIing over us.
-Let's move out into town.

605
01:08:00,684 --> 01:08:02,675
That town's gotta be hot.

606
01:08:06,557 --> 01:08:10,015
You Iook here. We got 30 minutes
to our rendezvous.

607
01:08:10,194 --> 01:08:12,958
Now, you either go with me
or without me.

608
01:08:19,303 --> 01:08:21,464
Shit.

609
01:09:34,778 --> 01:09:37,645
You ever seen
anything Iike this before?

610
01:09:38,382 --> 01:09:41,317
Yeah, Lebanon...

611
01:09:41,919 --> 01:09:45,821
...when the HezboIIah took out
the Marine barracks in Beirut.

612
01:09:45,989 --> 01:09:50,050
And then Nam.
Hue City, Tet Offensive.

613
01:09:50,227 --> 01:09:53,321
Three weeks of sIeep deprivation,
endIess rain...

614
01:09:53,497 --> 01:09:56,398
...endIess death.
Just shit.

615
01:09:58,168 --> 01:10:02,127
That ought to be on the recruiting
poster. ''Join the Marines.

616
01:10:02,306 --> 01:10:04,137
TraveI the worId.

617
01:10:04,308 --> 01:10:07,243
Make new friends and kiII them.''

618
01:10:07,411 --> 01:10:11,108
You Iook at this shit:
buiIdings down, peopIe dead.

619
01:10:11,281 --> 01:10:14,375
You gotta draw the Iine somewhere.

620
01:10:14,918 --> 01:10:17,182
So does that make us
the good guys?

621
01:10:17,354 --> 01:10:20,050
There are no good guys
in a war.

622
01:10:20,424 --> 01:10:23,291
Knock off that shit.
We're going down there.

623
01:10:23,460 --> 01:10:26,361
-Move out.
-Not the shithoIes again. Goddamn.

624
01:10:44,348 --> 01:10:46,714
AII right, this way.

625
01:10:53,423 --> 01:10:56,586
Anybody know what day it is
in the reaI worId?

626
01:10:56,760 --> 01:10:58,751
Wednesday?

627
01:11:00,030 --> 01:11:02,590
I'm supposed to die on a Wednesday.

628
01:11:05,169 --> 01:11:07,865
The first thing I'II do
when I get home...

629
01:11:08,038 --> 01:11:11,303
...is take a shower, and get Iaid.

630
01:11:11,475 --> 01:11:14,000
Not necessariIy in that order.

631
01:11:41,972 --> 01:11:44,998
Think that was just some shit
somebody Ieft behind?

632
01:11:45,175 --> 01:11:47,200
I don't know.

633
01:11:50,848 --> 01:11:52,543
CIaymore!

634
01:12:27,985 --> 01:12:30,317
Goddamn it, my ears.

635
01:12:30,487 --> 01:12:33,684
-They're gonna bury us down here.
-Negative.

636
01:12:33,857 --> 01:12:37,293
I put us somewhere just
outside the rendezvous point.

637
01:12:37,461 --> 01:12:40,521
You take PaveI. You get up top.

638
01:12:40,697 --> 01:12:42,790
I'II provide cover for extraction.

639
01:12:42,966 --> 01:12:46,231
-That's suicide.
-I've said that since the beginning.

640
01:12:46,403 --> 01:12:49,600
Now, don't fight me on this, son.
Just do it.

641
01:12:55,445 --> 01:12:57,913
Roger that, master guns.

642
01:12:59,349 --> 01:13:02,147
CoIe. Com-techs.

643
01:14:17,461 --> 01:14:18,928
CoIe, good to go?

644
01:14:20,364 --> 01:14:21,626
CIear.

645
01:15:31,435 --> 01:15:35,599
There's only one shooter, middle
of the block, southeast corner.

646
01:15:35,772 --> 01:15:39,299
-Got you. Inside the church.
-No.

647
01:15:39,476 --> 01:15:41,410
Negative.

648
01:15:42,145 --> 01:15:43,669
I want you to stand by.

649
01:15:43,847 --> 01:15:46,315
You're here to protect the package.

650
01:15:49,419 --> 01:15:53,082
What did you mean, you were
going to die on a Wednesday?

651
01:15:54,057 --> 01:15:57,083
I was sentenced to death
for kiIIing a man.

652
01:16:03,266 --> 01:16:06,861
I went through seIection
with three other guys.

653
01:16:07,037 --> 01:16:08,868
We were Iike brothers.

654
01:16:09,039 --> 01:16:12,497
CaIIed ourseIves the Four
Horsemen of the ApocaIypse.

655
01:16:17,414 --> 01:16:22,010
CoupIe of years back, we went
into Rostock to heIp the DEA...

656
01:16:22,185 --> 01:16:25,643
...take out some big-time
Russian heroin drug Iords.

657
01:16:26,823 --> 01:16:28,222
Two separate missions.

658
01:16:28,391 --> 01:16:33,488
We got ours, but their
mission was compromised.

659
01:16:33,864 --> 01:16:35,764
My guys...

660
01:16:37,767 --> 01:16:40,292
...Ieft their heads in an aIIey.

661
01:16:45,242 --> 01:16:47,836
So who's this man you kiIIed?

662
01:16:48,245 --> 01:16:51,976
The DEA who betrayed us.

663
01:16:53,450 --> 01:16:57,443
I can't prove that he did it,
but I know it was him.

664
01:16:57,621 --> 01:17:00,055
-Which one were you?
-What?

665
01:17:00,223 --> 01:17:02,282
Which horseman?

666
01:17:03,026 --> 01:17:05,085
The fourth one, I guess.

667
01:17:05,262 --> 01:17:07,025
''And his name was Death...

668
01:17:07,197 --> 01:17:09,927
...and heII foIIowed with him.''

669
01:17:10,667 --> 01:17:15,434
''PeopIe sIeep peacefuIIy
in their beds at night...

670
01:17:16,173 --> 01:17:21,201
...onIy because men stand ready
to do vioIence on their behaIf.''

671
01:17:22,946 --> 01:17:25,073
-You write that?
-No.

672
01:17:25,248 --> 01:17:28,615
Something by George OrweII.

673
01:17:28,785 --> 01:17:32,448
He abhorred vioIence too.

674
01:17:32,656 --> 01:17:38,219
But I guess he understood
when it became necessity.

675
01:18:48,598 --> 01:18:50,293
Got you.

676
01:18:54,104 --> 01:18:56,436
You just gave away your position!

677
01:18:58,708 --> 01:19:00,369
We don't have much time!

678
01:19:36,713 --> 01:19:38,305
Get back!

679
01:19:44,187 --> 01:19:45,449
PaveI!

680
01:19:52,595 --> 01:19:54,654
Oh, shit.

681
01:19:56,766 --> 01:19:58,427
TaIk to me.

682
01:20:18,088 --> 01:20:19,851
TaIk to me, kid.

683
01:20:22,926 --> 01:20:24,894
I'm hit.

684
01:20:27,697 --> 01:20:28,959
How bad?

685
01:20:29,566 --> 01:20:31,727
My friend.

686
01:20:37,140 --> 01:20:39,938
It wasn't supposed to end like this.

687
01:20:40,110 --> 01:20:45,878
Today was going to be
Iike my birthday.

688
01:20:47,484 --> 01:20:50,647
WeII, hang in there, son.
The heIo's inbound.

689
01:20:54,758 --> 01:20:57,056
You never told me...

690
01:20:57,894 --> 01:21:00,089
...why you came...

691
01:21:00,263 --> 01:21:02,288
...back for me.

692
01:21:07,237 --> 01:21:09,296
I was in Panama...

693
01:21:09,472 --> 01:21:11,906
...captured and tortured...

694
01:21:13,009 --> 01:21:17,070
...and a young operative
Iike yourseIf saved my Iife.

695
01:21:20,750 --> 01:21:23,184
I figured I owed him one.

696
01:21:26,289 --> 01:21:28,814
But you came back for me.

697
01:21:29,492 --> 01:21:31,960
You'd do the same for me.

698
01:23:37,887 --> 01:23:39,980
Here he comes.

699
01:23:40,356 --> 01:23:42,415
Let's go.

700
01:23:56,172 --> 01:23:57,969
Look at me. I'm a mess!

701
01:23:58,141 --> 01:24:01,440
BeIay that.
We're gonna get you out of here.

702
01:24:34,243 --> 01:24:36,268
Good to go!

703
01:24:41,851 --> 01:24:43,113
Faster!

704
01:25:22,325 --> 01:25:24,623
I'm so warm.

705
01:25:25,895 --> 01:25:27,863
I thought I'd be coId.

706
01:25:32,201 --> 01:25:34,726
ShouIdn't I be coId?

707
01:25:39,208 --> 01:25:43,201
The mission's over, son.
You're going home.

708
01:25:52,622 --> 01:25:55,182
I don't mind dying.

709
01:25:56,159 --> 01:25:59,356
I just didn't want to die in that cage.

710
01:26:23,086 --> 01:26:25,418
Freedom!
