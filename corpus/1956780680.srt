00:14:42,414 --> 00:14:44,617
[Lois]
Elizabeth?
[descending footsteps]

183
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,165
Ed...

184
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:03,302
Ed! Call 911!

185
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:04,637
[panting]

186
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:07,439
Tell me, what happened?

187
00:15:07,506 --> 00:15:10,009
A man took Elizabeth.
What...

188
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:12,411
What man? Who was it?
[phone buttons beeping]

189
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:15,114
I don't know.
I don't know.
Mary Katherine!

190
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:18,284
Yes. My daughter's been taken!
Tell Mommy what happened!

191
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:19,318
Yeah, yeah, she's gone!

192
00:15:19,385 --> 00:15:22,955
Why did he take her?
I don't know.

193
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,696
Jim, he took her!
Mary Katherine saw him!

194
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:33,465
He... He... He...
She saw him take her!
Lois!

195
00:15:33,532 --> 00:15:35,567
Why would he...
Why would anyone do that?

196
00:15:35,634 --> 00:15:37,136
She saw him?
Who was it?

197
00:15:37,202 --> 00:15:39,138
I don't know.
But find her.

198
00:15:39,204 --> 00:15:41,140
[siren blaring]
We've... We've gotta find her.

199
00:15:41,206 --> 00:15:43,742
We'll find her.
We'll find her.
We've gotta find her!

200
00:15:45,678 --> 00:15:47,313
Please! Please!

201
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:49,548
My... My daughter
was taken by a man.

202
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:52,618
Behold the sword of vengeance
hangeth over you,

203
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:54,720
and the time soon cometh
he avengeth the blood

204
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:56,422
of the saints and our people.

205
00:15:56,488 --> 00:15:59,158
For he will not suffer
their cries any longer.

206
00:15:59,224 --> 00:16:00,292
Where is she?

207
00:16:00,359 --> 00:16:02,194
They're gonna find her.

208
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:04,263
The boys are looking for her.
They're gonna find her.

209
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:05,831
Who would do this?
[door opens]

210
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:07,833
Who would...
Who would want to...

211
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:10,636
Mrs. Smart?

212
00:16:10,703 --> 00:16:13,405
Hi, I'm Detective Coleman.
I need to ask you
a few questions.

213
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:14,873
You mind if I sit down? No.

214
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:17,676
Has your daughter ever
snuck out of the house
at night before?

215
00:16:17,743 --> 00:16:19,712
No.

216
00:16:19,778 --> 00:16:22,715
No. Elizabeth would never
leave the house without...

217
00:16:22,781 --> 00:16:25,818
Did you have a fight?
Was she angry about something?

218
00:16:25,884 --> 00:16:27,386
No.

219
00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:28,487
[camera shutter clicking]

220
00:16:28,554 --> 00:16:31,123
We... We had words
about a vacation

221
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:33,559
she wanted to take
with a friend, but...

222
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:38,597
but I told her
she could go.

223
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:41,266
Well, girls can be
really sensitive at this age.

224
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,268
Can I get the name
and number of her friend?

225
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:45,270
Elizabeth's not with Katie.

226
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:48,640
Does she have a boyfriend?
Maybe one who lives nearby?
Has a car?

227
00:16:48,707 --> 00:16:50,509
Elizabeth doesn't
have a boyfriend.
She's 14.

228
00:16:52,311 --> 00:16:54,546
How much time does she spend
on the Internet?

229
00:16:54,613 --> 00:16:56,548
Do you know if she
was communicating
[door opens]

230
00:16:56,615 --> 00:16:58,283
with anyone in particular?

231
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:02,287
Mom!
Oh, sweetie!

232
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:04,156
Someone took her.

233
00:17:08,927 --> 00:17:11,697
[chattering]

234
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:18,637
Elizabeth Smart, age 14.
Apparent kidnapping.

235
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:20,773
The little sister saw the guy,

236
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:23,475
but she could be covering
for the big sister
if she snuck out.

237
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:26,145
The alarm was faulty.
The backdoor was unlocked.

238
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:27,446
They probably left that way.

239
00:17:27,513 --> 00:17:29,681
The kitchen window was open,
and the screen's been cut.

240
00:17:29,748 --> 00:17:31,683
Now, it looks to me like
it was cut from the inside.

241
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:34,286
Who are all these people?
Friends and family.

242
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:36,722
Some were here when we got here,
and more keep arriving.

243
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:38,090
Well, let's get them
all out of here.

244
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:40,426
This whole scene's
been contaminated.
All right.

245
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:42,561
I want you to listen to me.

246
00:17:42,628 --> 00:17:45,764
Elizabeth is strong.
She's smart.
She's got good judgment.

247
00:17:45,831 --> 00:17:47,366
So wherever she is,
she's being strong,

248
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:49,301
and she's gonna need you
to be strong for her.

249
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:51,336
Someone took her.

250
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:53,672
I don't know where she is.

251
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:56,542
Lois, look at me.
Look in my eyes.

252
00:17:56,608 --> 00:17:59,311
Our Heavenly Father
knows where Elizabeth is.

253
00:17:59,378 --> 00:18:01,580
Believe that in your heart.

254
00:18:01,647 --> 00:18:04,883
She's got guardian angels
all around her.

255
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:08,420
Lois? Where...

256
00:18:08,487 --> 00:18:10,889
Where is, uh, Lois?
Mr. Smart?

257
00:18:10,956 --> 00:18:12,724
Mr. Smart,
I'm Detective Richard Kassen.

258
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:14,426
I'd like to ask you
a few questions.

259
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:17,262
Please, can you get
some more men out there looking?

260
00:18:17,329 --> 00:18:18,797
Everything that can be done
right now is being done, sir.

261
00:18:18,864 --> 00:18:20,866
If I could just take
a few minutes with you...

262
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:22,734
Where is everyone going?

263
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:24,470
This house is
a crime scene, Mr. Smart.

264
00:18:24,536 --> 00:18:27,706
We have to take every precaution
to make sure that
whatever evidence is here

265
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:30,609
is not compromised in any way.
Yes, I understand.

266
00:18:30,676 --> 00:18:32,544
All right. Good.
Let me just clear
a few things up.

267
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,379
Your daughter's name
was Elizabeth?

268
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:36,515
Yes. Is Elizabeth.

269
00:18:36,582 --> 00:18:39,618
Right. Has she ever
run away before?

270
00:18:39,685 --> 00:18:42,387
No. No, she didn't run away.
She was taken.

271
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:44,022
I know how girls
this age can be.

272
00:18:44,089 --> 00:18:47,860
They think
they know everything...
Excuse me. What's being done?

273
00:18:47,926 --> 00:18:50,863
We're gonna take you
and your family
down to the station.

274
00:18:50,929 --> 00:18:52,397
[Officer]
Sir, you can't go in there.
Station?

275
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:54,766
It's okay, Officer.
Excuse me.
Wait a minute. What is it?

276
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:56,301
Who is this guy?
My brother Jim.

277
00:18:56,368 --> 00:18:58,537
What are you doing?
I gotta get her picture
on the news.

278
00:18:58,604 --> 00:19:02,407
Pete, set up
a house-to-house search
in the neighborhood.

279
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:04,943
Make sure you clear the homes
on the streets above
the Smart place.

280
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:08,614
Oh, and, uh, see if you can get
the chopper to do a flyover.
All right.

281
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:12,284
Mr. Smart, you may wanna
get some clothes on.

282
00:19:15,454 --> 00:19:17,890
[crying]

283
00:19:22,528 --> 00:19:25,330
[helicopter blades whirring]

284
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:29,635
[door buzzes]

285
00:19:29,701 --> 00:19:31,637
What's going on?

286
00:19:31,703 --> 00:19:33,839
Have a seat, Mr. Smart.

287
00:19:33,906 --> 00:19:37,509
Where's my family?
What... What's...
What's being done?

288
00:19:37,576 --> 00:19:39,611
Everybody's fine.
Your family's just fine.
Have a seat, please.

289
00:19:42,047 --> 00:19:45,284
All right.
Look, here's the problem.

290
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,653
We don't have a whole lot
to go on.

291
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:49,988
We got a nine-year-old girl
woken up in the middle
of the night

292
00:19:50,055 --> 00:19:51,990
who thinks maybe
she saw someone.

293
00:19:52,057 --> 00:19:54,626
Mary Katherine got
a good look at the man.

294
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:56,929
She said he was wearing
a dark-colored cap...

295
00:19:56,995 --> 00:20:00,299
I'm gonna level with you,
Mr. Smart.

296
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:03,435
I came in here to talk
to you alone,
just you and me.

297
00:20:03,502 --> 00:20:05,070
Please, where are my children?

298
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:06,538
They're fine, Mrs. Smart.

299
00:20:06,605 --> 00:20:08,340
Your mother
has the little ones,

300
00:20:08,407 --> 00:20:10,809
and Mary Katherine
and the older boy

301
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:12,544
are right next door.

302
00:20:12,611 --> 00:20:15,647
Now, we need to clear up
a few things.

303
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:18,050
How would you describe
your marriage?

304
00:20:18,116 --> 00:20:21,320
You got a mortgage.
You got a job and a wife.

305
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:23,355
You got six kids.
That's a lot on your plate.

306
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:26,091
Sometimes you can react
in a moment.

307
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:29,728
You make a mistake,
you explode, things...

308
00:20:29,795 --> 00:20:33,599
What does any of this have to do
with finding my daughter?

309
00:20:33,665 --> 00:20:37,102
Mr. Smart, I have to ask you
these questions, all right?

310
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:39,972
It's procedure.

311
00:20:40,038 --> 00:20:43,442
So, do you have something
to tell me?

312
00:20:43,508 --> 00:20:45,010
I'm right here.

313
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:48,647
Your husband ever
get angry with you
or your children?

314
00:20:48,714 --> 00:20:52,684
What? No. No.

315
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:54,686
I... I wanna go home.

316
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:56,755
I wanna be there
when Elizabeth gets home.

317
00:20:56,822 --> 00:20:58,457
I need...
No, what we need to do

318
00:20:58,523 --> 00:20:59,891
is get a good picture
of the family.

319
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:05,030
Now, what kind of father
is your husband?

320
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:08,700
My husband
did not take Elizabeth.

321
00:21:09,901 --> 00:21:11,837
Now bring me my children now.

322
00:21:11,903 --> 00:21:13,505
I just have
a few more questions.

323
00:21:13,572 --> 00:21:15,007
Please bring me my children now!

324
00:21:15,073 --> 00:21:18,877
You think it's me.

325
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:21,813
You think I took
my daughter and...

326
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:24,716
And what?
Hid her somewhere?

327
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:26,418
Is that what happened?

328
00:21:26,485 --> 00:21:30,489
I did not take my daughter.

329
00:21:30,555 --> 00:21:33,759
I understand
you've got to clear me.

330
00:21:33,825 --> 00:21:35,460
I... I... I get that now.

331
00:21:35,527 --> 00:21:37,863
But, please,
you're wasting time.

332
00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:40,499
We've got to find Elizabeth
before they get too far.

333
00:21:40,565 --> 00:21:41,867
Mr. Smart,
in our experience,

334
00:21:41,933 --> 00:21:44,169
when a young girl is taken
from her home like this,

335
00:21:44,236 --> 00:21:46,938
it is usually by someone
that she knows well, all right?

336
00:21:47,005 --> 00:21:49,541
And she is usually found
within two miles
of her own home.

337
00:21:49,608 --> 00:21:51,843
Did you know that?
No.

338
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,182
Your son Charles was home,
is that right?

339
00:21:57,249 --> 00:21:59,051
Yes.

340
00:21:59,117 --> 00:22:00,886
And does he get along
with your daughter?

341
00:22:00,952 --> 00:22:02,954
They fight?
They close?

342
00:22:03,021 --> 00:22:05,157
We're wasting time.

343
00:22:05,223 --> 00:22:08,660
Charles had nothing
to do with this.

344
00:22:08,727 --> 00:22:10,562
You think it might
be someone you know?

345
00:22:10,629 --> 00:22:13,065
I'm not sure.

346
00:22:13,131 --> 00:22:15,701
You said his voice
sounded familiar.

347
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:17,703
Yes, but not someone I know.

348
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:19,671
He was as tall as Charles.

349
00:22:19,738 --> 00:22:22,107
Charles.
Is that your big brother?

350
00:22:23,275 --> 00:22:25,811
How old is Charles?
He's 15.

351
00:22:25,877 --> 00:22:28,213
So you and your sister
are pretty close in age.

352
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,948
You guys fight a lot?

353
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:32,150
Not a lot.

354
00:22:32,217 --> 00:22:33,518
Sometimes, I guess.

355
00:22:33,585 --> 00:22:35,654
You know, I had a sister.
I know how that can be.

356
00:22:35,721 --> 00:22:37,656
Sometimes she makes you
so angry,

357
00:22:37,723 --> 00:22:39,691
you just don't know
what to do.

358
00:22:39,758 --> 00:22:40,892
Not really.

359
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:44,096
She's pretty,
that's for sure.

360
00:22:44,162 --> 00:22:45,797
Maybe one of your friends
likes her.

361
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:47,833
Everyone likes her.

362
00:22:47,899 --> 00:22:50,202
No, I mean
in a special way, like...

363
00:22:50,268 --> 00:22:51,903
like a boyfriend.

364
00:22:53,972 --> 00:22:55,507
No.

365
00:22:55,574 --> 00:22:58,410
[chattering]
[siren blares]

366
00:23:00,645 --> 00:23:03,615
[Officer]
Keep those people back,
you hear me?

367
00:23:10,922 --> 00:23:14,593
[Woman]
Make sure you get
a shot of both!

368
00:23:14,659 --> 00:23:17,629
[Reporters shouting questions]

369
00:23:21,633 --> 00:23:23,668
Jim,

370
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:25,003
wha...

371
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:27,005
I need you to talk
to the media.

372
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:30,675
Oh, no, Jim.
I don't wanna say...
We need the press.

373
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:32,911
We've got to get
this story out now,

374
00:23:32,978 --> 00:23:34,546
this minute.

375
00:23:34,613 --> 00:23:36,648
We can't afford
to lose any more time.

376
00:23:36,715 --> 00:23:38,650
The first few hours
are critical.

377
00:23:38,717 --> 00:23:41,553
We need you to talk
to the public.

378
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,755
We need you to talk
to whoever has her.

379
00:23:43,822 --> 00:23:46,658
Could you talk to us?
Tell us something?
Look this way, please.

380
00:23:46,725 --> 00:23:49,127
Please,

381
00:23:49,194 --> 00:23:52,230
whoever took Elizabeth,

382
00:23:52,297 --> 00:23:55,801
I can't imagine why
you would take her.

383
00:23:55,867 --> 00:23:58,170
She's our daughter.

384
00:23:58,236 --> 00:24:01,039
Please let her go

385
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:04,109
or... or bring her home.

386
00:24:05,177 --> 00:24:08,213
Please bring her back.

387
00:24:09,681 --> 00:24:11,616
I would pray that you realize

388
00:24:11,683 --> 00:24:13,552
she's just a child.

389
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:15,320
This guy seems real.

390
00:24:15,387 --> 00:24:18,890
She's our daughter.

391
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:21,726
I'm gonna call the FBI.

392
00:24:23,094 --> 00:24:26,598
She needs to be home with us.

393
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:35,674
[Man]
Elizabeth!
[Woman]
Elizabeth!

394
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,542
Elizabeth!

395
00:24:37,609 --> 00:24:40,745
[Jim] There's this guy
that's offered to fly over
the area in his Cessna.

396
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:42,681
Good.
And I spoke
to Dawn Anderson

397
00:24:42,747 --> 00:24:44,816
from the Laura
Recovery Foundation.

398
00:24:44,883 --> 00:24:47,085
She flew in from Texas
last night when she heard.

399
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:49,921
She's helping us set up
a search center
at the Shriners Hospital.

400
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:51,890
What did she have to say?
She said we gotta keep

401
00:24:51,957 --> 00:24:54,059
Elizabeth's name
front and center.

402
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:56,895
Daily press briefings,
color posters

403
00:24:56,962 --> 00:24:58,730
with all of her information
along the bottom...

404
00:24:58,797 --> 00:25:02,234
age, height,
her hair and eye color,

405
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:04,102
what she was wearing
the night she was taken.

406
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:06,037
How many posters?
[dog barking]

407
00:25:06,104 --> 00:25:08,106
Oh, I figure
50 to start with.

408
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:10,742
50 colored posters?
That'll take a long time.

409
00:25:10,809 --> 00:25:13,211
Ed, 50,000 colored posters,
and we need them now.

410
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:15,280
We gotta cover the airports,
freeways, borders,

411
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:17,649
bus stations, you name it.

412
00:25:17,716 --> 00:25:18,750
[Man]
Elizabeth!

413
00:25:18,817 --> 00:25:19,951
[Emmanuel]
Thank thee God
for delivering

414
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:22,787
this jewel of innocence
that we may,
[crying]

415
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:25,757
as members of this society,
be faithful.

416
00:25:25,824 --> 00:25:28,693
And through this great
trust of light,

417
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:31,997
priceless diamonds forming.

418
00:25:32,063 --> 00:25:35,233
A brilliant
shining diamond truth.

419
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:39,337
Let us be obedient in all things
and willing to sacrifice
all things,

420
00:25:39,404 --> 00:25:41,406
even our very lives
if necessary.

421
00:25:41,473 --> 00:25:43,708
Cold?
That we be of mortal...

422
00:25:43,775 --> 00:25:46,077
[Emmanuel continues rambling]
I wanna go home.

423
00:25:46,144 --> 00:25:48,580
You are home.

424
00:25:50,248 --> 00:25:52,150
[crying continues]

425
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:55,320
You're lucky.
He chose you.

426
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:57,722
...gleam in his eyes,
in his heart.

427
00:25:57,789 --> 00:25:59,724
He who suffered and died...
[Man]
Elizabeth!

428
00:25:59,791 --> 00:26:01,793
Elizabeth!

429
00:26:02,961 --> 00:26:04,996
Elizabeth!

430
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:06,331
They're looking for me.

431
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:09,734
Don't worry.
They'll stop.

432
00:26:09,801 --> 00:26:11,770
[Emmanuel]
They shall not find her.
She belongs to me.

433
00:26:14,873 --> 00:26:18,443
Elizabeth!
[Emmanuel resumes rambling]

434
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:20,645
[ringing]

435
00:26:24,015 --> 00:26:25,717
[beeping]
[beeps]

436
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:29,621
Hello?

437
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:33,358
Who is this?

438
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:36,027
No, absolutely not!

439
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:37,362
[beeps]

440
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:38,863
Who was that?

441
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:42,233
He said he was a reporter
with the
Salt Lake City Gazette.

442
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:45,070
He wanted to interview
Mary Katherine.

443
00:26:47,806 --> 00:26:49,941
[ringing]

444
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:26,378
I'm sorry.
You can't touch that.

445
00:27:26,444 --> 00:27:28,847
It's still part
of the crime scene.

446
00:27:32,183 --> 00:27:33,318
[sniffles]

447
00:27:33,385 --> 00:27:36,321
Can I get you something
to eat or drink?

448
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:40,325
How do I know if she's eating?

449
00:27:43,461 --> 00:27:46,331
How do I know
if she's warm?

450
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,468
You're going to
find her, right?

451
00:27:50,535 --> 00:27:53,705
We're doing
everything we can.

452
00:28:03,581 --> 00:28:06,217
[Emmanuel]
Forget about your past life.

453
00:28:06,284 --> 00:28:08,353
It had no meaning.

454
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:11,456
I'm all you have.

455
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:14,025
I'm the one who knows
the real you.

456
00:28:14,092 --> 00:28:15,560
[fabric tears]

457
00:28:15,627 --> 00:28:17,562
And that bright light
that shines within you

458
00:28:17,629 --> 00:28:20,799
is something
only I can see.

459
00:28:22,434 --> 00:28:25,904
I want my mom and dad.

460
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:28,807
They no longer exist.

461
00:28:33,011 --> 00:28:36,181
Uh, this... this is a...
this is a list of everyone

462
00:28:36,247 --> 00:28:38,583
I could remember who...
who worked on the house

463
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:40,485
in the last year.

464
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:43,555
This is a list
of all the people

465
00:28:43,621 --> 00:28:46,257
that attended
Elizabeth's last concert.

466
00:28:46,324 --> 00:28:48,827
And, um, these are...
these are the names

467
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:52,330
of... of all of her friends
that might've seen her
with someone.

468
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:53,832
Great.
This is all gonna help.

469
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:55,967
Uh, I need
to get back home.

470
00:28:56,034 --> 00:28:57,602
I can have one of my men
take you back.
I need...

471
00:28:57,669 --> 00:28:59,938
I need to... to...
Mr. Smart, are you all right?

472
00:29:00,004 --> 00:29:01,473
Mr. Smart?

473
00:29:04,609 --> 00:29:06,911
[beeps]
I need an ambulance
right away.

474
00:29:06,978 --> 00:29:10,515
Ed Smart was taken
to the hospital today
after he collapsed.

475
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:14,152
Doctors there said
he was suffering
from exhaustion and stress

476
00:29:14,219 --> 00:29:16,287
and is expected
to recover quickly.

477
00:29:16,354 --> 00:29:18,590
The Smart family
has organized a search

478
00:29:18,656 --> 00:29:20,458
through the mountains
behind their home

479
00:29:20,525 --> 00:29:22,527
with the help
of thousands of volunteers.

480
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:25,063
Mayor Rocky Anderson
has just announced

481
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:27,065
that the reward
for Elizabeth's safe return

482
00:29:27,132 --> 00:29:30,101
is up to $250,000.

483
00:29:30,168 --> 00:29:33,304
The money appears to be coming
from major corporations

484
00:29:33,371 --> 00:29:36,141
in the area
and concerned local citizens.

485
00:29:36,207 --> 00:29:37,609
I have never seen anything

486
00:29:37,675 --> 00:29:40,178
quite like the scope
of this search.

487
00:29:40,245 --> 00:29:44,182
It seems as if the whole world
feels like they've
lost Elizabeth.

488
00:29:44,249 --> 00:29:46,584
We're here to sign up.

489
00:29:46,651 --> 00:29:49,087
Sorry, kids.
You've gotta be 18 to search.

490
00:29:49,154 --> 00:29:50,455
We are 18.

491
00:29:56,995 --> 00:29:59,030
Just be careful, okay?

492
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:29,561
[People shouting]
Elizabeth!

493
00:30:29,627 --> 00:30:31,896
[plane overhead]

494
00:30:33,064 --> 00:30:35,466
Elizabeth!

495
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:43,508
[Man yelling]

496
00:30:43,575 --> 00:30:45,510
[dog barking]

497
00:30:45,577 --> 00:30:47,212
[Woman]
Elizabeth!

498
00:30:50,381 --> 00:30:52,584
Elizabeth!

499
00:30:54,485 --> 00:30:57,555
[Man]
Elizabeth, can you hear us?

500
00:31:04,229 --> 00:31:06,197
[Man]
Elizabeth!

501
00:31:06,264 --> 00:31:08,233
[Woman]
Elizabeth!

502
00:31:09,734 --> 00:31:10,602
[Man]
Elizabeth!

503
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:20,678
Elizabeth!

504
00:31:33,791 --> 00:31:37,028
Lay out the bedrolls,
then come join us
for God's bounty.

505
00:31:38,429 --> 00:31:40,265
They're still
looking for me.

506
00:31:40,331 --> 00:31:45,003
Did I not tell you
I am your salvation?

507
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:47,238
You eat
if I say you eat.

508
00:31:47,305 --> 00:31:49,674
You sleep if I say you sleep.

509
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:53,745
I walked into your house
and took you.

510
00:31:53,811 --> 00:31:55,380
God had me do that.
Don't you see?

511
00:31:55,446 --> 00:31:57,115
You live if I let you live.

512
00:31:57,181 --> 00:32:00,118
Your family lives
if I say they live.

513
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:04,555
Now do as I say.

514
00:32:13,331 --> 00:32:17,168
[Man, distant]
Elizabeth!

515
00:32:17,235 --> 00:32:19,570
[Woman, distant]
Elizabeth!

516
00:32:21,139 --> 00:32:22,640
[Emmanuel's voice]
Don't say a word

517
00:32:22,707 --> 00:32:25,343
or I will kill you
and your family.

518
00:32:29,414 --> 00:32:31,549
[Man, distant]
Elizabeth!

519
00:32:36,487 --> 00:32:39,557
[Woman]
Elizabeth!
[Man] Elizabeth!

520
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:43,494
Elizabeth! Elizabeth!
Elizabeth!

521
00:32:45,396 --> 00:32:48,066
Elizabeth!

522
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:51,436
[yelling]
Elizabeth!

523
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,109
Elizabeth!

524
00:32:58,176 --> 00:33:00,211
Elizabeth!

525
00:33:28,239 --> 00:33:30,174
It's me, Daddy.

526
00:33:48,793 --> 00:33:51,129
[chattering]

527
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:54,699
[Lois]
Did we say everything?

528
00:33:54,766 --> 00:33:56,634
Did we remember to mention
the reward again?

529
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:58,436
[Man]
You did fine.

530
00:33:58,503 --> 00:34:01,406
I don't know how
they expect you to become
public speakers overnight.

531
00:34:01,472 --> 00:34:02,874
[Ed]
We just wanna say
the right thing,

532
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:04,809
reach whoever we can.

533
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:07,612
I'm Marc Klaas.
I'm here to help.

534
00:34:07,678 --> 00:34:10,548
I followed your story.
I'm sorry about your daughter.

535
00:34:10,615 --> 00:34:12,550
Thank you for coming.

536
00:34:12,617 --> 00:34:14,552
The first thing
we need to do

537
00:34:14,619 --> 00:34:16,487
is to get a forensic
specialist up here

538
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:18,256
to talk to
the younger sister.

539
00:34:18,322 --> 00:34:20,324
She's an eyewitness,
and the image of that man

540
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:21,526
is burned into her retina.

541
00:34:21,592 --> 00:34:24,295
Now, there's a woman
named Jeanne Boylan.

542
00:34:24,362 --> 00:34:26,364
She's the leading forensic
sketch artist in the country,

543
00:34:26,431 --> 00:34:28,199
and I can have her here
in half an hour.

544
00:34:28,266 --> 00:34:30,668
The police and FBI told us
not to push her...

545
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:32,870
that we might
taint her memory.

546
00:34:32,937 --> 00:34:36,607
Ed, your daughter's
been missing
for six days.

547
00:34:36,674 --> 00:34:38,376
Jim...

548
00:34:38,443 --> 00:34:39,844
You need to try
everything that you can.

549
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:42,246
Uh, this is Marc Klaas.

550
00:34:42,313 --> 00:34:43,915
This is my brother Jim.

551
00:34:43,981 --> 00:34:46,184
I know who you are.
Thanks for coming down.

552
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:47,952
We can use all the help
we can get.

553
00:34:48,019 --> 00:34:50,955
Ed, why don't you let me
talk to your daughter?
What's her name? Mary Elizabeth?

554
00:34:51,022 --> 00:34:52,957
Maybe I could get her
to remember...
You know what?

555
00:34:53,024 --> 00:34:56,794
We really appreciate
the help, Marc,
but that's not gonna happen.

556
00:34:56,861 --> 00:34:59,697
There's no way
this kid's still alive.
We're looking for a corpse.

557
00:35:03,901 --> 00:35:06,571
I'm sorry.

558
00:35:06,637 --> 00:35:09,373
From the bottom
of my heart,

559
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,442
thank you for helping.

560
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:16,347
Jim, if I could just
sit down with Ed and Lois

561
00:35:16,414 --> 00:35:17,849
and talk to them.

562
00:35:17,915 --> 00:35:19,550
I've been in their shoes,

563
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:21,652
and I can empathize
with what they're going through.

564
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:23,588
I'll try and arrange something.
How long are you in town?

565
00:35:23,654 --> 00:35:25,690
As long as you need.
Good. Thank you.

566
00:35:25,756 --> 00:35:28,226
I will talk to Ed tonight.

567
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:30,661
Uh, I'm gonna wanna film
our conversation.

568
00:35:30,728 --> 00:35:32,363
Is that okay?

569
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:34,565
You wanna film

570
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:36,767
your "father to grieving father"
conversation?

571
00:35:36,834 --> 00:35:37,835
Why?

572
00:35:39,504 --> 00:35:41,572
Who are you representing?

573
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:43,474
Myself...

574
00:35:43,541 --> 00:35:45,309
and Fox News.

575
00:35:45,376 --> 00:35:48,012
They're very interested
in the whole story
surrounding the kidnapping,

576
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:50,314
and I thought it'd be
very good for this case...

577
00:35:50,381 --> 00:35:53,284
Go home, Mr. Klaas.

578
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:59,724
I'm just here to help.

579
00:36:01,859 --> 00:36:04,829
[Reporters shouting questions]

580
00:36:13,104 --> 00:36:15,773
Hey, everyone.
This is Chris Thomas.

581
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,708
He and his partner
own Intrepid Group,

582
00:36:17,775 --> 00:36:19,443
a public relations firm.

583
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:21,445
He's put his business on hold

584
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:22,914
to handle the media for us.

585
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:24,849
Thank you so much.
Thanks.

586
00:36:24,916 --> 00:36:26,784
I've got some news.

587
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:28,786
Tomorrow morning,
the
Salt Lake City Tribune

588
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:31,355
is gonna run a story
that says the investigation

589
00:36:31,422 --> 00:36:32,990
is now pointing
toward a family member.

590
00:36:33,057 --> 00:36:35,826
[People gasping]
[Jim]
You've gotta be kidding.

591
00:36:35,893 --> 00:36:38,763
Why? What happened
to that guy that the milkman saw
in the neighborhood?

592
00:36:38,829 --> 00:36:41,966
The guy in the green Saturn?
Bret Michael Edmunds.

593
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:44,635
The police are looking for him.
They say they just
wanna talk to him,

594
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:46,871
but he has not
been identified as a suspect.

595
00:36:46,938 --> 00:36:50,341
They can't find him
so it has to be one of us?

596
00:36:50,408 --> 00:36:53,344
The article is gonna say
that it's been determined

597
00:36:53,411 --> 00:36:55,880
that the window screen
was cut from the inside...

598
00:36:55,947 --> 00:36:58,883
that the entrance was staged.

599
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:01,419
Two of the reporters
at the
Tribune...

600
00:37:01,485 --> 00:37:03,721
a Kevin Cantera
and Michael Vigh...

601
00:37:03,788 --> 00:37:06,424
claim they have four sources
within the police department

602
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:07,725
who will confirm
what they're printing.

603
00:37:07,792 --> 00:37:09,660
What sources?
[Man]
Yeah.

604
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:11,963
You can't say that.
You can't just lie.

605
00:37:12,029 --> 00:37:14,799
In any big story,
there's going to be
false accusations

606
00:37:14,865 --> 00:37:16,701
and people who wanna
get their names in the paper.

607
00:37:16,767 --> 00:37:19,437
People will read that.
They might believe it.

608
00:37:19,503 --> 00:37:22,340
Well, the police
have to make a statement
saying it's not true.

609
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:24,875
I tried. They won't.
Not in time.

610
00:37:24,942 --> 00:37:26,611
It'll be on
the news tonight.

611
00:37:26,677 --> 00:37:27,845
It'll be in
the newspapers tomorrow.

612
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:29,914
Every news source in the country
will pick this up.

613
00:37:29,981 --> 00:37:32,817
People will stop searching
if they read this article.

614
00:37:32,883 --> 00:37:34,685
Why should they bother
searching for Elizabeth

615
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:36,954
when they think
we took her ourselves?

616
00:37:37,021 --> 00:37:39,290
[murmuring]

617
00:37:42,059 --> 00:37:44,829
[Chris]
We have to release
a family statement

618
00:37:44,895 --> 00:37:46,631
saying that we're cooperating
with the police

619
00:37:46,697 --> 00:37:49,834
and that we will continue
to do whatever it is
they ask of us, okay?

620
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:51,602
[machine crackling]

621
00:37:51,669 --> 00:37:53,070
[Man]
How old are you?

622
00:37:53,137 --> 00:37:55,573
[Ed]
I'm 46.

623
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:58,542
In those 46 years,
did you ever hurt anyone?

624
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:01,078
I... I... I don't understand.

625
00:38:01,145 --> 00:38:05,383
You mean physically
or emotionally?

626
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:08,052
Just answer the question.

627
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:10,121
Yes, I guess

628
00:38:10,187 --> 00:38:13,090
in 46 years,
I've hurt someone.

629
00:38:13,157 --> 00:38:15,526
Is your name Ed?

630
00:38:15,593 --> 00:38:17,061
Yes.

631
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:20,097
Did you take
your daughter, Elizabeth?

632
00:38:20,164 --> 00:38:22,433
No.

633
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,735
Did you kill
your daughter, Elizabeth?

634
00:38:27,872 --> 00:38:29,373
No.

635
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:33,010
You have no idea
how to serve me.

636
00:38:33,077 --> 00:38:34,745
You mock me when you
pretend to love me.

637
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:36,781
That's not true.
I've given my whole life to you.

638
00:38:36,847 --> 00:38:39,150
Perfect obedience
leads to perfect love,

639
00:38:39,216 --> 00:38:40,818
leads to perfect faith.

640
00:38:40,885 --> 00:38:42,186
You're not worthy.
Your soul is lost

641
00:38:42,253 --> 00:38:43,888
in vanity and false pride.

642
00:38:43,954 --> 00:38:46,991
Your role in this life
is to serve me!

643
00:38:47,058 --> 00:38:48,859
I've done that!

644
00:38:48,926 --> 00:38:51,095
You know to disobey me
is to go against God

645
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:52,863
and to damn yourself
to an eternity in hell?

646
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:55,032
You know that?
I've given up
my whole family!

647
00:38:55,099 --> 00:38:57,601
I have followed you
wherever you've led me.

648
00:38:57,668 --> 00:39:00,538
All I said was that
I miss my daughter.

649
00:39:00,604 --> 00:39:02,573
She is your sister
in his eyes,

650
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,475
and you better get used
to the idea.

651
00:39:04,542 --> 00:39:07,745
It's the plan...
[continues]

652
00:39:53,324 --> 00:39:55,893
[screams]
Where are you going?

653
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:58,562
Nowhere. I was just...
You know I have your house
surrounded, don't you?

654
00:39:58,629 --> 00:40:00,598
You know they will all die
if you are discovered?

655
00:40:00,664 --> 00:40:02,666
You'll never know
who is part of me.

656
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:05,035
You'll never know
who you can trust.

657
00:40:05,102 --> 00:40:07,638
Now let's go home.

658
00:40:16,947 --> 00:40:20,184
You're a child
who ran away from her parents.

659
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:21,952
I'm the one
who saved you, right?

660
00:40:22,019 --> 00:40:24,822
That's who I am...
your savior.

661
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:33,931
I will kill you.
I will kill your family.

662
00:40:33,998 --> 00:40:36,567
They will all die.
[echoing]

663
00:40:40,638 --> 00:40:44,208
It basically
says that, uh...

664
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:46,677
[clears throat]
It says that Jim
and David and Ed

665
00:40:46,744 --> 00:40:48,612
are part of a gay sex ring...

666
00:40:48,679 --> 00:40:50,247
that their wives
know about it,

667
00:40:50,314 --> 00:40:52,750
and that somehow
the sex ring

668
00:40:52,817 --> 00:40:54,552
is responsible for Elizabeth
being taken.

669
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:56,554
[laughter]

670
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:59,089
What's so funny?
It's just so ridiculous.

671
00:40:59,156 --> 00:41:01,792
No one's gonna
believe that nonsense.
They've gone too far.

672
00:41:01,859 --> 00:41:04,762
Unfortunately, the mainstream
media will pick this up,

673
00:41:04,829 --> 00:41:07,031
so many people
will think it's true.

674
00:41:07,097 --> 00:41:10,201
Oh!
You're going to
have to defend yourselves

675
00:41:10,267 --> 00:41:12,803
if you wanna maintain
the support of the people.

676
00:41:14,238 --> 00:41:16,941
[scoffs]
What do we do?

677
00:41:17,007 --> 00:41:22,079
We reject this malicious attack
on our family.

678
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:25,850
We will not respond
to vicious lies.

679
00:41:25,916 --> 00:41:28,586
We, as a family,

680
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:31,956
stand united in our faith

681
00:41:32,022 --> 00:41:35,759
and in our desire
to find Elizabeth.

682
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:39,163
[Reporter]
One more question, please.
Mr. Smart! Mr. Smart!

683
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:41,732
[Reporters shouting questions]

684
00:41:46,971 --> 00:41:48,939
How come we get
to live at home again?

685
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:52,109
Well, we have to be here
when Elizabeth gets back.

686
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:56,146
Later, we're gonna go
to the animal shelter
and get a dog.

687
00:41:56,213 --> 00:41:58,148
I always wanted a dog.
Yeah.

688
00:41:58,215 --> 00:41:59,950
You said
we couldn't have one.

689
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:02,152
Now we can.

690
00:42:02,219 --> 00:42:04,922
I wish I had my BB gun.
I could've shot him.

691
00:42:04,989 --> 00:42:07,625
Honey, this wasn't something
you could've stopped.

692
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:09,326
Mary Katherine
could've stopped him.

693
00:42:09,393 --> 00:42:11,128
She could've screamed
or bit him.

694
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:13,697
That's not true.

695
00:42:13,764 --> 00:42:16,734
Okay, your sister
may have saved your life.

696
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,669
She may have saved
all of our lives.

697
00:42:18,736 --> 00:42:20,704
We don't know
what that man would've done.

698
00:42:20,771 --> 00:42:22,873
And she kept watch
over all of us,

699
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:25,009
and she woke up Daddy
when she thought it was safe.

700
00:42:25,075 --> 00:42:27,645
Mary Katherine is a hero.

701
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:36,153
You know that,
don't you, sweetie?

702
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:39,223
I could've stopped him.
I was too scared.

703
00:42:41,258 --> 00:42:43,327
You did the right thing.

704
00:42:47,031 --> 00:42:49,233
Do you think Elizabeth
knows that?

705
00:42:51,368 --> 00:42:54,138
Yeah, I do.

706
00:42:58,742 --> 00:43:01,312
[Ed]
Why wouldn't they be scared?

707
00:43:01,378 --> 00:43:04,248
Someone can come in here
in the middle of the night,

708
00:43:04,315 --> 00:43:06,450
take one of them,

709
00:43:06,517 --> 00:43:08,852
and their father
wouldn't even hear.

710
00:43:17,161 --> 00:43:19,797
[dog barking, distant]

711
00:43:31,041 --> 00:43:32,876
Tear it up.

712
00:43:39,883 --> 00:43:41,151
[paper ripping]
[crying]

713
00:43:44,521 --> 00:43:45,956
[ripping continues]
[crying continues]

714
00:43:57,167 --> 00:44:00,838
To the holders
of Elizabeth Ann Smart

715
00:44:00,904 --> 00:44:04,742
and our friends
throughout the world,

716
00:44:04,808 --> 00:44:07,111
it has been several weeks
since our daughter, Elizabeth,

717
00:44:07,177 --> 00:44:10,814
was awakened and taken
by force from our home.

718
00:44:12,116 --> 00:44:14,318
Every minute of every day,

719
00:44:14,385 --> 00:44:16,520
we search for her

720
00:44:16,587 --> 00:44:18,522
and pray for her

721
00:44:18,589 --> 00:44:21,225
and yearn for her
to come home.

722
00:44:22,426 --> 00:44:24,962
So many of you

723
00:44:25,029 --> 00:44:27,965
have helped us in that search
and in our prayers,

724
00:44:28,032 --> 00:44:31,268
and we wanna thank you
from the bottom of our hearts.

725
00:44:33,871 --> 00:44:36,473
She's still out there,

726
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:39,743
waiting for us
to come and find her.

727
00:44:42,279 --> 00:44:44,748
Someone out there
knows where she is.

728
00:44:47,117 --> 00:44:50,320
Elizabeth, be strong.

729
00:44:51,321 --> 00:44:54,158
We won't break our promise.

730
00:44:54,224 --> 00:44:56,160
[gasps]

731
00:44:56,226 --> 00:44:58,328
[laughing]

732
00:45:00,264 --> 00:45:02,766
We are going to find you.

733
00:45:03,567 --> 00:45:05,469
Bret Michael Edmunds,

734
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:07,137
who was seen
in the Smarts' neighborhood

735
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:08,539
the week of
Elizabeth's disappearance,

736
00:45:08,605 --> 00:45:12,309
was questioned by police
in a West Virginia hospital.

737
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:15,879
It was determined
that Mr. Edmunds knows nothing
about the disappearance,

738
00:45:15,946 --> 00:45:17,815
and we believe that this is
a dead end.

739
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:20,117
Thank you very much.
[Reporters shouting questions]

740
00:45:22,152 --> 00:45:24,221
Guess what?
[Kassen]
What's that?

741
00:45:24,288 --> 00:45:27,224
Remember Richard Ricci?
Worked at the Smart house.

742
00:45:27,291 --> 00:45:29,226
Ricci. Ricci.

743
00:45:29,293 --> 00:45:31,295
Oh, yeah. Tall guy.

744
00:45:31,361 --> 00:45:33,997
Didn't we bring him in
for questioning,
and his wife gave him an alibi?

745
00:45:34,064 --> 00:45:36,333
Yeah, they just brought him in
on a parole violation.

746
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,868
I think we should
question him again.

747
00:45:41,972 --> 00:45:44,942
All right. Make it so.

748
00:45:45,008 --> 00:45:46,610
Thanks.

749
00:45:46,677 --> 00:45:49,947
Give up.
You're not gonna find anything.

750
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:55,452
You can ask me
for 24 more hours,

751
00:45:55,519 --> 00:45:57,554
and the answer
will still be no.

752
00:45:57,621 --> 00:46:01,825
I did not have anything
to do with taking that girl.

753
00:46:04,161 --> 00:46:06,497
Okay, fine.
Let's start again
at the beginning.

754
00:46:07,931 --> 00:46:10,167
Your dime.

755
00:46:10,234 --> 00:46:12,202
I got nowhere to go.

756
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:14,371
Sure you do,
you heartless bastard.

757
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:15,739
How about I throw you in
with the general population

758
00:46:15,806 --> 00:46:17,875
and let them ask you
where you put the little girl?

759
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:20,277
You know I lost
my own son when he was just 9?

760
00:46:20,344 --> 00:46:22,279
Don't tell me about heartless.

761
00:46:22,346 --> 00:46:24,581
You played that card, Richard.

762
00:46:24,648 --> 00:46:27,384
Where'd you go
in the jeep?

763
00:46:30,387 --> 00:46:33,457
You took their jewelry.

764
00:46:34,658 --> 00:46:36,460
When did you decide
to take their daughter?

765
00:46:39,296 --> 00:46:41,265
[sighs]

766
00:46:41,331 --> 00:46:43,834
Go to hell.

767
00:46:45,569 --> 00:46:48,305
We've arrested a guy
on a parole violation.

768
00:46:48,372 --> 00:46:50,140
[Coleman]
He was on one of your lists.

769
00:46:50,207 --> 00:46:51,608
He worked at your house
for a long time.

770
00:46:51,675 --> 00:46:52,609
Who?

771
00:46:52,676 --> 00:46:55,245
His name is Richard Ricci.

772
00:46:55,312 --> 00:46:57,948
Richard...

773
00:46:58,015 --> 00:47:00,951
He knew all our children
by name.

774
00:47:01,018 --> 00:47:03,520
We gave him a jeep
so he could come and go.

775
00:47:03,587 --> 00:47:05,689
He knew the layout
of our house.

776
00:47:05,756 --> 00:47:09,359
I fired him because
Lois's jewelry was missing.

777
00:47:09,426 --> 00:47:11,495
Ricci's a heroin addict.

778
00:47:11,562 --> 00:47:13,397
He's got a record that
goes back three decades.

779
00:47:14,765 --> 00:47:17,501
[Coleman]
We found it when
we searched his home.

780
00:47:19,770 --> 00:47:21,638
That's my bracelet.

781
00:47:21,705 --> 00:47:24,474
He's probably pawned
some of the stones.

782
00:47:24,541 --> 00:47:26,410
Now, he's got
a dubious alibi

783
00:47:26,476 --> 00:47:28,512
for the night that
Elizabeth was taken,

784
00:47:28,579 --> 00:47:29,846
and, uh...
Yeah?

785
00:47:29,913 --> 00:47:33,650
Two days before the night
Elizabeth disappeared,

786
00:47:33,717 --> 00:47:37,054
Ricci took his jeep
out of a garage
where it was being serviced.

787
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:40,257
When he returned it
several days later,
it was covered in mud,

788
00:47:40,324 --> 00:47:42,292
two of the seat covers
were missing,

789
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:44,294
and there were
a thousand extra miles

790
00:47:44,361 --> 00:47:47,064
on the vehicle that he can't,
or won't, account for.

791
00:47:47,130 --> 00:47:50,367
[Coleman]
Now, we're analyzing
the mud that was on the jeep,

792
00:47:50,434 --> 00:47:54,037
see if we can't figure out
where he's been, but...

793
00:47:54,104 --> 00:47:56,173
So where is she?

794
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:58,175
Where is Elizabeth?

795
00:47:58,242 --> 00:48:00,110
I'm afraid we don't know.

796
00:48:00,177 --> 00:48:01,712
He's not talking.

797
00:48:01,778 --> 00:48:04,147
[Coleman]
He's claiming he's innocent.

798
00:48:04,214 --> 00:48:06,750
His wife, Angela,
says he was with her

799
00:48:06,817 --> 00:48:08,552
the night...
well, that night.

800
00:48:10,821 --> 00:48:13,190
Ed, Lois,

801
00:48:13,257 --> 00:48:16,627
I'm 99.9% sure
that we have our guy.

802
00:48:16,693 --> 00:48:18,629
[sniffling]

803
00:48:18,695 --> 00:48:21,031
[no audible dialogue]
[crying]

804
00:48:27,271 --> 00:48:29,573
[crying]

805
00:49:05,108 --> 00:49:07,210
[screaming]

806

[dog barking]

807
00:49:09,379 --> 00:49:11,348
Mom!
[screaming]

808
00:49:11,415 --> 00:49:13,517
How can you call it a prank?

809
00:49:13,583 --> 00:49:15,719
It happened exactly
the same way as our house.

810
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:17,654
The screen was cut
the exact same way.

811
00:49:17,721 --> 00:49:20,724
She's my niece.
How can that be a coincidence?

812
00:49:22,259 --> 00:49:24,728
Detective,
[sighs]

813
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:26,730
I... I... I don't mean
to do that...

814
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:28,732
tell you how to do your job,

815
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:31,535
but it seems to me...

816
00:49:31,601 --> 00:49:33,770
I... I know, but...

817
00:49:35,272 --> 00:49:36,540
Fine.

818
00:49:36,606 --> 00:49:38,108
[beeps]

819
00:49:40,844 --> 00:49:44,481
It's like the police
simply want to be done with it.

820
00:49:46,783 --> 00:49:51,555
Ed, maybe it is
just a copycat.

821
00:49:51,621 --> 00:49:54,558
You know
how crazy people are.

822
00:49:54,624 --> 00:49:57,527
And Richard Ricci
is in custody.

823
00:49:58,595 --> 00:50:00,197
Come on, Lois.

824
00:50:00,263 --> 00:50:03,533
The screen, the knife.

825
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:08,038
I know it's the same man.

826
00:50:09,473 --> 00:50:10,607
[gavel bangs]

827
00:50:10,674 --> 00:50:14,478
[Judge]
The State of Utah
vs. Richard Ricci.

828
00:50:14,544 --> 00:50:16,480
Mr. Ricci, you've been
convicted of burglary

829
00:50:16,546 --> 00:50:18,482
and will be held
pending sentencing.

830
00:50:18,548 --> 00:50:20,784
The sentencing will be set
for August 30.

831
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:23,387
Your trail for bank robbery
has been set for November...

832
00:50:23,453 --> 00:50:26,523
Forget the robbery.
Why isn't he asking him
where Elizabeth is?

833
00:50:26,590 --> 00:50:30,193
They haven't even charged him
with that yet.

834
00:50:33,397 --> 00:50:35,065
Excuse me.
Mrs. Ricci?

835
00:50:37,467 --> 00:50:41,204
Please, I beg you.

836
00:50:41,271 --> 00:50:43,874
Please ask Richard
to tell us where he was,

837
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:45,575
what he knows.

838
00:50:45,642 --> 00:50:47,411
Does he know where
Elizabeth is?

839
00:50:47,477 --> 00:50:50,647
Look, I know
that you're hurting,

840
00:50:50,714 --> 00:50:52,482
but Richard was in bed
with me that night.

841
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:54,384
Where did he go
in the jeep?

842
00:50:54,451 --> 00:50:55,852
Why won't he tell us
where he was?

843
00:50:55,919 --> 00:50:57,788
Why does he keep
changing his story?

844
00:50:57,854 --> 00:51:00,624
Honestly, I don't know.

845
00:51:00,690 --> 00:51:02,893
But I know that Richie
would never hurt a child.

846
00:51:02,959 --> 00:51:04,594
Never.

847
00:51:06,863 --> 00:51:08,565
Please.

848
00:51:10,634 --> 00:51:13,203
I'll talk to him again.

849
00:51:19,342 --> 00:51:21,812
It's been two weeks.
Angela doesn't seem
to know anything.

850
00:51:21,878 --> 00:51:23,613
That's because Ricci
hasn't told her anything.

851
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:25,282
Well, maybe
I could talk to him.

852
00:51:25,348 --> 00:51:28,251
I could plead with him
as a mother.

853
00:51:28,318 --> 00:51:30,287
I'll see what I can do.
Please.

854
00:51:30,353 --> 00:51:32,222
We could go to the mayor.

855
00:51:32,289 --> 00:51:33,924
He'd understand.
He'd help us.

856
00:51:33,990 --> 00:51:36,626
Mrs. Smart,
we have to go through
so many official channels...

857
00:51:36,693 --> 00:51:38,762
At any time,
our daughter could be killed!

858
00:51:38,829 --> 00:51:41,364
Do you realize that?
Even now while we're standing
here talking about it!

859
00:51:42,866 --> 00:51:44,601
I'll see what I can do.

860
00:51:54,377 --> 00:51:56,146
[paper ripping]

861
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:03,220
[phone ringing]

862
00:52:05,021 --> 00:52:06,723
Mmm.

863
00:52:07,691 --> 00:52:09,292
[beeps]

864
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:11,294
Hello?

865
00:52:16,533 --> 00:52:18,335
Oh.

866
00:52:19,603 --> 00:52:22,339
Well, thank you
for telling me.

867
00:52:23,773 --> 00:52:25,242
[beeps]

868
00:52:25,308 --> 00:52:27,544
That was Detective Kassen.

869
00:52:29,846 --> 00:52:33,583
Richard Ricci suffered
a brain aneurysm last night.

870
00:52:35,585 --> 00:52:36,887
What?

871
00:52:38,088 --> 00:52:39,656
Well, what does that mean?

872
00:52:40,924 --> 00:52:43,193
Essentially, he's brain dead.

873
00:52:46,496 --> 00:52:47,931
No.

874
00:52:52,869 --> 00:52:55,272
Then it's... it...

875
00:52:55,338 --> 00:52:57,274
it's... it's over.

876
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:03,213
Come. Come here.
[crying]

877
00:53:16,526 --> 00:53:18,662
I'm sorry you're so sad.

878
00:53:21,031 --> 00:53:23,500
I'm just tired,
Mary Katherine.

879
00:53:24,834 --> 00:53:26,570
She's gonna come home.

880
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:30,473
I know she is.

881
00:53:32,375 --> 00:53:34,778
It's too bad
we have to wait so long.

882
00:53:39,783 --> 00:53:42,619
That's not the man
that took Elizabeth.

883
00:53:51,461 --> 00:53:53,296
A-Are you sure, honey?

884
00:53:54,164 --> 00:53:56,433
I'm positive.

885
00:53:58,501 --> 00:54:01,071
But Mary Katherine
just saw the picture,

886
00:54:01,137 --> 00:54:03,673
and she says
it's not Ricci.

887
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:06,009
Maybe he's not
the right man after all.

888
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:07,577
It was him, Ed.

889
00:54:07,644 --> 00:54:10,447
He was probably
working with someone,
but it was him.

890
00:54:10,513 --> 00:54:13,483
The police are sure.
Maybe we should be following
other leads.

891
00:54:13,550 --> 00:54:15,418
There are no other leads.

892
00:54:15,485 --> 00:54:17,354
Well, of course there are.

893
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:20,357
I can't let this
consume my life anymore.

894
00:54:20,423 --> 00:54:23,693
I have five other children
who need me.

895
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:25,829
They have to start school.

896
00:54:25,895 --> 00:54:27,864
They have to start living
a normal life,

897
00:54:27,931 --> 00:54:29,265
and I'm never here,

898
00:54:29,332 --> 00:54:32,569
because I'm in press conferences
from 4:00 a.m. to midnight.

899
00:54:32,636 --> 00:54:34,804
Do you wanna have
a memorial for her?

900
00:54:34,871 --> 00:54:36,840
Is that what
you're saying?

901
00:54:36,906 --> 00:54:39,009
No.

902
00:54:39,075 --> 00:54:41,411
I'll always have hope.

903
00:54:41,478 --> 00:54:44,381
But I'm so afraid,

904
00:54:44,447 --> 00:54:47,450
every time the phone rings,

905
00:54:47,517 --> 00:54:50,687
it's the police telling me
they found her body.

906
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:55,058
She's gone.

907
00:54:56,092 --> 00:54:58,395
She's just gone.

908
00:54:59,195 --> 00:55:01,398
I don't believe that.

909
00:55:02,999 --> 00:55:04,934
Well, I have to.

910
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:09,706
For the other children,

911
00:55:11,574 --> 00:55:13,610
I have to.

912
00:56:41,998 --> 00:56:45,268
..."and reserve a swift judgment
against every worker"...

913
00:56:45,335 --> 00:56:46,970
[continues rambling]

914
00:56:47,036 --> 00:56:50,173
You are so young,
and you know so little.

915
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:52,108
But as you grow up,

916
00:56:52,175 --> 00:56:54,811
you will understand
how lucky you are

917
00:56:54,878 --> 00:56:58,047
to be here, away from
the sins of the world.

918
00:56:58,114 --> 00:57:00,183
My family's
still looking for me.

919
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:02,252
[chuckles]
No.

920
00:57:02,318 --> 00:57:04,921
No, they stopped long ago.

921
00:57:08,324 --> 00:57:09,859
[firewood thudding]

922
00:57:21,204 --> 00:57:24,741
[Emmanuel]
Stop crying.
Don't be lifted up in pride.

923
00:57:24,808 --> 00:57:28,044
You should pray for forgiveness
for holding on
to worldy connections.

924
00:57:28,111 --> 00:57:31,648
Your only connection is to me
and to God everlasting.

925
00:57:31,714 --> 00:57:34,717
Now come. Come, come.

926
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:41,791
[chattering]

927
00:58:03,646 --> 00:58:06,282
I have to go
to the bathroom.

928
00:58:18,695 --> 00:58:20,663
[scraping]

929
00:58:29,372 --> 00:58:32,242
I think there might be something
to the call we got from Texas

930
00:58:32,308 --> 00:58:33,910
about the guy in the car.

931
00:58:33,977 --> 00:58:35,879
Ed, it's over, all right?

932
00:58:35,945 --> 00:58:38,882
Now, we have searched
all across America.

933
00:58:38,948 --> 00:58:41,918
We've had dozens
of FBI investigators
work this case.

934
00:58:41,985 --> 00:58:44,287
We've brought in
cold case experts,
criminal profilers.

935
00:58:44,354 --> 00:58:46,289
We've done it all.

936
00:58:46,356 --> 00:58:48,291
You're just gonna have to
find a way to let go.

937
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:53,630
My daughter is alive, Richard.

938
00:58:53,696 --> 00:58:56,132
I know she's out there,

939
00:58:56,199 --> 00:58:59,802
and she's depending on me
to find her.

940
00:58:59,869 --> 00:59:03,773
Well, it's possible
that somebody that knows Ricci
will come forward and tell us...

941
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:06,409
Mary Katherine saw
a picture of Ricci.
She says it's not him.

942
00:59:06,476 --> 00:59:08,778
He was not the one
in her room that night.

943
00:59:08,845 --> 00:59:12,949
I know Mary Katherine
didn't recognize his picture,

944
00:59:13,016 --> 00:59:16,753
but it was late
and it was dark.

945
00:59:16,819 --> 00:59:19,889
Look, Ed, I understand
how you feel.
I really do.

946
00:59:19,956 --> 00:59:22,659
There is no evidence
my daughter is dead.

947
00:59:22,725 --> 00:59:23,726
None.

948
00:59:26,095 --> 00:59:28,298
She's alive,

949
00:59:28,364 --> 00:59:30,300
and I will not give up.

950
00:59:30,366 --> 00:59:32,969
With or without your help,

951
00:59:33,036 --> 00:59:35,271
I will never give up.

952
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:41,344
[Ed]
And we're offering
a $10,000 reward

953
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:45,248
for any information
clearing Richard Ricci.

954
00:59:45,315 --> 00:59:48,084
We know that Ricci
had someone meet him

955
00:59:48,151 --> 00:59:51,154
when he dropped off the jeep
at the garage.

956
00:59:52,789 --> 00:59:55,858
We still stand firm
in our belief

957
00:59:55,925 --> 00:59:58,628
that Elizabeth is alive.

958
01:00:00,897 --> 01:00:02,765
Mary Katherine,
you hungry?

959
01:00:02,832 --> 01:00:04,701
No, thanks.

960
01:00:04,767 --> 01:00:06,436
How's the scrapbook coming?

961
01:00:06,502 --> 01:00:08,304
Really good.
I've got something

962
01:00:08,371 --> 01:00:10,306
from almost every week
she's been gone.

963
01:00:10,373 --> 01:00:12,375
I don't want her to feel
like she missed anything.

964
01:00:12,442 --> 01:00:14,243
[chuckles]

965
01:00:14,310 --> 01:00:16,679
Oh, you're
a wonderful sister.

966
01:00:18,214 --> 01:00:20,783
You know that,
don't you?

967
01:00:26,122 --> 01:00:28,925
You know, honey,

968
01:00:31,227 --> 01:00:33,463
there's a chance

969
01:00:33,529 --> 01:00:37,800
that Elizabeth is in heaven

970
01:00:39,135 --> 01:00:41,771
with Grandpa.

971
01:00:41,838 --> 01:00:44,340
I know, but she's not.

972
01:00:44,407 --> 01:00:46,809
She's trying to get home.

973
01:00:54,951 --> 01:00:58,087
"Cry the Lord, and with you,

974
01:00:58,154 --> 01:01:00,456
I will stand by you."

975
01:01:02,158 --> 01:01:05,495
Daddy, I think
I know who it is.

976
01:01:05,561 --> 01:01:07,797
Hmm?

977
01:01:07,864 --> 01:01:10,733
I think I know
who took Elizabeth.

978
01:01:15,204 --> 01:01:17,473
It was Emmanuel.

979
01:01:17,540 --> 01:01:19,709
Remember that guy we met
when we were shopping?

980
01:01:21,177 --> 01:01:23,246
That was, uh...

981
01:01:23,312 --> 01:01:26,149
The guy that came
to the house to work
on the roof with you.

982
01:01:26,215 --> 01:01:28,818
That was over a year ago?

983
01:01:29,919 --> 01:01:31,454
Yes.

984
01:01:34,323 --> 01:01:36,426
This is a new lead.

985
01:01:36,492 --> 01:01:39,028
This is who
she remembers.

986
01:01:39,095 --> 01:01:41,397
You said, "Don't taint
her memory," and we didn't.

987
01:01:41,464 --> 01:01:44,167
And her mind finally cleared.
She remembered.

988
01:01:44,233 --> 01:01:47,503
She always said he was
about as tall as Charles,
which is 5'8".

989
01:01:47,570 --> 01:01:48,971
Ricci was over six feet.
Over six feet.

990
01:01:49,038 --> 01:01:51,374
I get it, Ed.
Look, you're just gonna
have to trust on this.

991
01:01:51,441 --> 01:01:52,842
We are doing everything
that we can.

992
01:01:52,909 --> 01:01:56,012
I don't know why
you didn't have me
make a sketch.

993
01:01:56,079 --> 01:01:58,147
I was on the roof with him.
I remember what he looks like.

994
01:01:58,214 --> 01:02:01,350
Ed, I'm sorry. I just...

995
01:02:01,417 --> 01:02:03,119
I don't think
this is going anywhere.

996
01:02:03,186 --> 01:02:05,288
Now, I'm gonna send a couple
guys around the shelters

997
01:02:05,354 --> 01:02:07,190
to look for this, uh...
Emmanuel.

998
01:02:07,256 --> 01:02:08,224
...this Emmanuel.

999
01:02:08,291 --> 01:02:10,159
There could be a hundred

1000
01:02:10,226 --> 01:02:11,994
homeless guys
that do odd jobs.

1001
01:02:12,061 --> 01:02:14,230
Mary Katherine doesn't
remember a hundred men,

1002
01:02:14,297 --> 01:02:15,965
she remembers just one.

1003
01:02:16,032 --> 01:02:18,401
I know, Ed.
We talked to her.

1004
01:02:18,468 --> 01:02:21,104
Now, let me see
what I can do.

1005
01:02:22,405 --> 01:02:24,507
Okay.

1006
01:02:25,908 --> 01:02:28,010
Ed, it's Peter Coleman.

1007
01:02:28,077 --> 01:02:31,247
Listen, I've just met
this artist, Darlene Neilson.

1008
01:02:31,314 --> 01:02:33,049
Would you mind trying her out?

1009
01:02:33,116 --> 01:02:37,019
Maybe you guys can come up
with a sketch of the man
that Mary Katherine remembers.

1010
01:02:37,086 --> 01:02:38,488
[Officer]
Attempted shoplifting.

1011
01:02:38,554 --> 01:02:39,822
Calls himself Emmanuel.

1012
01:02:39,889 --> 01:02:42,358
Doesn't have any ID,
but gives his date of birth

1013
01:02:42,425 --> 01:02:44,026
as sometime after
the birth of Christ.

1014
01:02:44,093 --> 01:02:46,896
[Officer on radio]
Is he cooperating with you?
Yeah, seems harmless.

1015
01:02:46,963 --> 01:02:49,899
Then we got nothing here.
No warrants.

1016
01:02:49,966 --> 01:02:51,501
Roger. Let him go.

1017
01:02:51,567 --> 01:02:52,969
Okay.

1018
01:02:55,004 --> 01:02:56,539
On your way.

1019
01:03:01,177 --> 01:03:02,545
May I help you?

1020
01:03:02,612 --> 01:03:05,314
I'm looking for maps
of San Diego
and the surrounding areas.

1021
01:03:05,381 --> 01:03:08,017
Yes. Maps.
That will be in
our reference section.

1022
01:03:10,953 --> 01:03:12,388
Emmanuel will kill
the rest of your family.

1023
01:03:12,455 --> 01:03:15,525
He has followers
surrounding your house.

1024
01:03:17,493 --> 01:03:19,495
Are you two okay?

1025
01:03:21,330 --> 01:03:24,200
Yes, we're fine,
thank you.

1026
01:03:24,267 --> 01:03:27,370
My daughter and I...
we're planning on traveling
south with my husband.

1027
01:03:27,436 --> 01:03:29,405
He's... He's just
looking at maps now.

1028
01:03:29,472 --> 01:03:30,973
[Emmanuel]
Thank you so much.

1029
01:03:38,047 --> 01:03:39,315
Are you okay?

1030
01:03:43,553 --> 01:03:46,022
Are you Elizabeth Smart?

1031
01:03:46,088 --> 01:03:48,391
Her name is Augustine.
She's very shy.

1032
01:03:53,763 --> 01:03:55,698
Well, you folks
have a nice day.

1033
01:03:55,765 --> 01:03:57,934
Thank you so much, Officer.

1034
01:04:05,408 --> 01:04:07,343
[Man]
This is the final boarding call

1035
01:04:07,410 --> 01:04:09,412
for Coach 63 to San Diego.

1036
01:04:09,478 --> 01:04:13,149
Final boarding call
for Coach 63 to San Diego.

1037
01:04:31,734 --> 01:04:34,103
[Ed]
Our Father in heaven,

1038
01:04:34,170 --> 01:04:36,706
we are thankful for our family
gathered together here

1039
01:04:36,772 --> 01:04:38,674
on Elizabeth's birthday.

1040
01:04:38,741 --> 01:04:40,610
We thank Thee for Elizabeth,

1041
01:04:40,676 --> 01:04:43,512
for her spirit
of love and kindness.

1042
01:04:43,579 --> 01:04:46,716
We ask that Thou
wilt watch over her
and keep her safe,

1043
01:04:46,782 --> 01:04:49,452
that she might one day
return to us.

1044
01:04:49,518 --> 01:04:52,588
We pray that the abductor
might feel Thy spirit,

1045
01:04:52,655 --> 01:04:55,391
and his heart be softened
and changed

1046
01:04:55,458 --> 01:04:58,661
that he might let her go.

1047
01:04:58,728 --> 01:05:01,497
We do this in the name
of Jesus Christ.

1048
01:05:01,564 --> 01:05:03,266
Amen.

1049
01:05:03,332 --> 01:05:05,301
[together]
Amen.

1050
01:05:06,569 --> 01:05:08,504
I thought we could go
around the table

1051
01:05:08,571 --> 01:05:12,308
and each say something
that we remember

1052
01:05:12,375 --> 01:05:15,678
and miss about Elizabeth.

1053
01:05:15,745 --> 01:05:18,481
I know that I miss
her helping me

1054
01:05:18,547 --> 01:05:20,716
make blueberry pancakes
on Sunday mornings.

1055
01:05:20,783 --> 01:05:22,718
[chuckling]

1056
01:05:22,785 --> 01:05:24,654
I miss her
reading to me.

1057
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:26,622
I'm old enough
to read by myself,

1058
01:05:26,689 --> 01:05:29,058
but it's better
when she reads to me,

1059
01:05:29,125 --> 01:05:32,094
so I can close my eyes
and picture the story.

[Emmanuel]
On this day 15 years ago,

1064
01:05:49,645 --> 01:05:52,515
Jesus chose you
to come into this world.

1065
01:05:54,250 --> 01:05:56,352
And it was then
that He whispered to me

1066
01:05:56,419 --> 01:05:58,287
that you would be mine.

1067
01:06:01,157 --> 01:06:03,392

01:06:03,459 --> 01:06:05,695

1069
01:06:10,166 --> 01:06:12,168
Happy birthday.

1070

[chattering]

1071
01:06:43,432 --> 01:06:45,234
[Man]
Merry Christmas to you.

1072
01:06:45,301 --> 01:06:46,502
[Woman]
Yeah.

1073
01:06:54,577 --> 01:06:57,446
[chattering continues]

1074
01:06:57,513 --> 01:07:00,316
Get back in line.
I want more food.

1075
01:07:01,617 --> 01:07:03,586
Don't speak to anyone.

1076
01:07:03,652 --> 01:07:05,421
I never do.

1077
01:07:05,488 --> 01:07:07,123
Good girl.

1078
01:07:09,792 --> 01:07:13,763
So your dad and I made
each of you a memory box.

1079
01:07:13,829 --> 01:07:15,698
We wrote each of you
a letter

1080
01:07:15,765 --> 01:07:17,700
telling you how much
you mean to us.

1081
01:07:17,767 --> 01:07:19,235
Thank you.

1082
01:07:19,301 --> 01:07:21,237
And we put it
inside of a box

1083
01:07:21,303 --> 01:07:22,738
with some pictures

1084
01:07:22,805 --> 01:07:26,175
and things we collected
over the years.

1085
01:07:26,242 --> 01:07:27,777
What about a miracle?

1086
01:07:27,843 --> 01:07:29,512
What?

1087
01:07:29,578 --> 01:07:31,347
It's Christmas.
Maybe we'll get a miracle.

1088
01:07:33,949 --> 01:07:36,152
I hope so, honey.

1089
01:07:47,630 --> 01:07:49,498
[Emmanuel]
On this day many years ago,

1090
01:07:49,565 --> 01:07:51,434
a child was born.

1091
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:53,569
A special child

1092
01:07:53,636 --> 01:07:55,871
that would die
for our sins.

1093
01:07:57,273 --> 01:07:59,208
Now I am here,

1094
01:07:59,275 --> 01:08:02,278
as God willed it,
to spread His word.

1095
01:08:02,344 --> 01:08:03,679
Shall we pray?

1096
01:08:05,915 --> 01:08:07,750
Having heard Your words,
Father,

1097
01:08:07,817 --> 01:08:11,353
and having understood
your plan for me,

1098
01:08:11,420 --> 01:08:14,457
I will be Your vessel
in this world

1099
01:08:14,523 --> 01:08:16,292
and in heaven beyond.

1100
01:08:16,358 --> 01:08:18,627
Let us hold hands.

1101
01:08:20,996 --> 01:08:25,568
I will call
this shining soul Augustine.

1102
01:08:26,769 --> 01:08:29,238
She will forever be mine

1103
01:08:29,305 --> 01:08:32,541
and forever serve the Lord
through me.

1104
01:08:36,979 --> 01:08:39,682
Do you do so freely,
Augustine?

to come into this world ♪

1106

that He whispered to me... ♪

1107
01:08:57,633 --> 01:09:00,870
We sent people around
to all the surrounding shelters,
looking for this Emmanuel.

1108
01:09:00,936 --> 01:09:02,571
We don't have anything
in our database.

1109
01:09:02,638 --> 01:09:04,340
There's not a whole lot more
we can do.

1110
01:09:04,406 --> 01:09:05,908
Ricci took her, all right?

1111
01:09:05,975 --> 01:09:08,277
He may have had an accomplice,
and we are still looking
for the guy.

1112
01:09:08,344 --> 01:09:10,546
You've been looking for him
since October.

1113
01:09:10,613 --> 01:09:12,348
Nothing's happening.

1114
01:09:12,414 --> 01:09:14,316
What can it hurt
to put out the sketch?

1115
01:09:14,383 --> 01:09:16,485
It can generate
hundreds of false leads.

1116
01:09:16,552 --> 01:09:18,888
All our manpower looking
for Ricci's accomplice

1117
01:09:18,954 --> 01:09:22,858
goes on a wild-goose chase,
we lose time and focus.

1118
01:09:22,925 --> 01:09:25,861
It's frustrating
not having answers, Ed.
I know that.

1119
01:09:25,928 --> 01:09:28,464
Let us do this our way.

1120
01:09:28,531 --> 01:09:30,499
[scoffs]
W... W... What...

1121
01:09:31,734 --> 01:09:33,569
Richard...
Hey, Ed?

1122
01:09:34,837 --> 01:09:37,306
Do what you feel
in your heart.

1123
01:09:40,509 --> 01:09:43,445
Anyone with information
about Richard Ricci

1124
01:09:43,512 --> 01:09:44,947
is asked to come forward.

1125
01:09:45,014 --> 01:09:47,016
The Smarts want
to clear Mr. Ricci

1126
01:09:47,082 --> 01:09:48,951
of kidnapping Elizabeth.

1127
01:09:49,018 --> 01:09:50,452
Ed.

1128
01:09:50,519 --> 01:09:53,822
Elizabeth,
we are looking for you.

1129
01:09:53,889 --> 01:09:57,826
We have not given up.

1130
01:09:57,893 --> 01:09:59,828
We know you're trying

1131
01:09:59,895 --> 01:10:01,830
to come home to us.

1132
01:10:01,897 --> 01:10:04,567
We will never give up.

1133
01:10:06,535 --> 01:10:09,305
Thanks, Ed.
You can wrap that up now
if you want.

1134
01:10:09,371 --> 01:10:12,308
I think it's gonna
generate some new calls.

1135
01:10:12,374 --> 01:10:15,444
John, can I speak to you
in confidence?

1136
01:10:15,511 --> 01:10:17,580
You know you can.

1137
01:10:17,646 --> 01:10:20,516
You know how grateful
I am to you for calling us

1138
01:10:20,583 --> 01:10:23,352
and putting us
on your program.

1139
01:10:23,419 --> 01:10:26,655
I know. I'll continue
to do anything I can.

1140
01:10:26,722 --> 01:10:30,659
Mary Katherine
came to me in October,

1141
01:10:30,726 --> 01:10:32,628
told me she thinks
she remembers

1142
01:10:32,695 --> 01:10:34,964
who was in
her room that night.

1143
01:10:35,030 --> 01:10:37,967
She said it was
this fellow, Emmanuel,

1144
01:10:38,033 --> 01:10:40,769
who worked for us
more than a year ago.

1145
01:10:40,836 --> 01:10:43,072
He was only at the house
for a few hours,

1146
01:10:43,138 --> 01:10:45,975
but she seems to remember.

1147
01:10:46,041 --> 01:10:47,977
I had a sketch made,

1148
01:10:48,043 --> 01:10:50,879
but Lois doesn't want me
to go out with it

1149
01:10:50,946 --> 01:10:53,582
because she wants
to protect Mary Katherine.

1150
01:10:53,649 --> 01:10:55,618
Have you told the police?
Yes.

1151
01:10:55,684 --> 01:10:57,753
But they say
don't release it.

1152
01:10:57,820 --> 01:11:01,690
It might generate hundreds
of false leads.

1153
01:11:01,757 --> 01:11:03,759
And if we put out
a picture of him,

1154
01:11:03,826 --> 01:11:06,862
it might scare him off,
and he'll go underground.

1155
01:11:06,929 --> 01:11:08,731
It's your daughter
who's missing.

1156
01:11:08,797 --> 01:11:10,966
She doesn't belong
to the detectives
working your case.

1157
01:11:11,033 --> 01:11:13,869
You do what you think
is best for your family.

1158
01:11:15,004 --> 01:11:16,805
Thanks, John.

1159
01:11:16,872 --> 01:11:19,475
I'll call you if I decide
to go out with it.

1160
01:11:19,541 --> 01:11:21,577
Okay.

1161
01:11:24,913 --> 01:11:27,683
You say you have
new information

1162
01:11:27,750 --> 01:11:29,485
on the Elizabeth Smart
kidnapping?

1163
01:11:29,551 --> 01:11:31,186
I spoke with Ed recently.

1164
01:11:31,253 --> 01:11:32,254
He told me his young daughter,
Mary Katherine,

1165
01:11:32,321 --> 01:11:35,024
remembers who was in
her room that night.

1166
01:11:35,090 --> 01:11:36,625
[Man]
After all this time?

1167
01:11:36,692 --> 01:11:39,528
She's the only eyewitness
to the crime.

1168
01:11:39,595 --> 01:11:41,697
I met her.
She's a bright young girl.

1169
01:11:41,764 --> 01:11:43,565
America's Most Wanted
is going to take a look

1170
01:11:43,632 --> 01:11:45,367
a look at this new information.

1171
01:11:47,536 --> 01:11:49,405
Wh... What did you do?

1172
01:11:49,471 --> 01:11:52,007
I told him that
in confidence.

1173
01:11:53,642 --> 01:11:55,678
Do you know
what this means?

1174
01:11:55,744 --> 01:11:58,514
This will take
the spotlight off of Ricci.

1175
01:11:58,580 --> 01:12:00,549
And what if
Mary Katherine is wrong?

1176
01:12:00,616 --> 01:12:03,619
W... We can't put her
through that again.

1177
01:12:03,686 --> 01:12:05,754
She's suffered enough.
Don't do this to her.

1178
01:12:05,821 --> 01:12:09,591
But...th... there's a chance.

1179
01:12:09,658 --> 01:12:12,094
What were you thinking?

1180
01:12:20,002 --> 01:12:22,004
[sighs]

1181
01:12:24,139 --> 01:12:25,641
[beeps]

1182
01:12:28,811 --> 01:12:29,611
Hey.

1183
01:12:32,114 --> 01:12:34,583
It's late.
You should go to bed.

1184
01:12:34,650 --> 01:12:37,152
I didn't realize
he was dangerous.

1185
01:12:40,723 --> 01:12:43,726
I didn't realize

1186
01:12:43,792 --> 01:12:46,628
he could be someone
who could hurt us.

1187
01:12:47,863 --> 01:12:49,865
He seemed nice.

1188
01:12:51,300 --> 01:12:53,235
It's not your fault.

1189
01:12:53,302 --> 01:12:55,871
Of course it's my fault.

1190
01:12:55,938 --> 01:12:59,208
I'm the mother. I'm supposed
to keep my children safe.

1191
01:12:59,274 --> 01:13:01,610
You kept them safe.

1192
01:13:01,677 --> 01:13:03,479
You did everything
in your power

1193
01:13:03,545 --> 01:13:06,582
to give them a secure home.

1194
01:13:06,648 --> 01:13:08,584
Evil will find a place

1195
01:13:08,650 --> 01:13:10,586
through a crack in the wall.

1196
01:13:15,924 --> 01:13:19,728
There was nothing
we could've done to prevent it.

1197
01:13:19,795 --> 01:13:21,997
We go out
with that sketch tomorrow.

1198
01:13:23,699 --> 01:13:25,134
Really?

1199
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:28,036
I don't know if Emmanuel's
involved or not,

1200
01:13:28,103 --> 01:13:30,506
but we have to eliminate him
as a suspect.

1201
01:13:33,242 --> 01:13:35,010
Okay.

1202
01:13:35,077 --> 01:13:37,946
There are good reasons
why Richard Ricci

1203
01:13:38,013 --> 01:13:39,948
is the top potential suspect

1204
01:13:40,015 --> 01:13:41,850
in Elizabeth's kidnapping.

1205
01:13:41,917 --> 01:13:44,186
He stole from our home.
He lied to us.

1206
01:13:44,253 --> 01:13:48,757
He never came forward
with satisfactory answers
to our questions.

1207
01:13:48,824 --> 01:13:50,626
The Smarts are on
a wild-goose chase.

1208
01:13:50,692 --> 01:13:54,730
This guy... this Emmanuel...
is just one of a dozen guys
we're looking at.

1209
01:13:54,797 --> 01:13:57,299
I don't blame Ed.
He's just trying
to keep the case alive.

1210
01:13:57,366 --> 01:13:59,168
He's trying to keep
Elizabeth's name in the press.

1211
01:13:59,234 --> 01:14:01,303
There are, however,

1212
01:14:01,370 --> 01:14:03,672
reasons to believe Ricci
was not the person

1213
01:14:03,739 --> 01:14:06,041
in the house that night.

1214
01:14:06,108 --> 01:14:08,310
Mary Katherine
described a man

1215
01:14:08,377 --> 01:14:11,880
about her brother's height,
which is 5'8".

1216
01:14:11,947 --> 01:14:14,249
Ricci was over six feet.

1217
01:14:14,316 --> 01:14:16,185
She said
the man was familiar

1218
01:14:16,251 --> 01:14:18,720
but not someone
she knew well.

1219
01:14:18,787 --> 01:14:20,722
Richard Ricci
was in our home for months.

1220
01:14:20,789 --> 01:14:23,091
She would've known him.

1221
01:14:23,158 --> 01:14:25,561
Mary Katherine
has come forward

1222
01:14:25,627 --> 01:14:27,863
with this man.

1223
01:14:27,930 --> 01:14:30,265
He calls himself Emmanuel.

1224
01:14:30,332 --> 01:14:33,235
Our number-one suspect
is still Richard Ricci,

1225
01:14:33,302 --> 01:14:36,705
and we continue to believe
that he is the one
who took Elizabeth.

1226
01:14:36,772 --> 01:14:39,241
We are not saying
he's a suspect.

1227
01:14:39,308 --> 01:14:42,678
He's just someone
we'd like to speak to.

1228
01:14:42,744 --> 01:14:44,680
Richard Ricci
may have been involved

1229
01:14:44,746 --> 01:14:47,149
in Elizabeth's kidnapping,

1230
01:14:47,216 --> 01:14:50,686
but I don't believe
he's the one who took her.

1231
01:15:18,947 --> 01:15:20,716
[Woman]
So where are you guys from?
[Emmanuel] We're from heaven.

1232
01:15:20,782 --> 01:15:22,718
We were sent here by God

1233
01:15:22,784 --> 01:15:25,120
to do His work.

1234
01:15:25,187 --> 01:15:26,922
There you go.

1235
01:15:26,989 --> 01:15:28,690
Thanks.

1236
01:15:28,757 --> 01:15:31,193
Do you have a bag?
Yeah.

1237
01:15:31,260 --> 01:15:33,195
[glass shatters]

1238
01:16:25,414 --> 01:16:26,348
Hey.

1239
01:16:26,415 --> 01:16:27,983
Hmm?

1240
01:16:29,151 --> 01:16:30,285
What are you doing here?

1241
01:16:31,486 --> 01:16:33,922
What's your name?

1242
01:16:33,989 --> 01:16:35,891
Michael Jensen.

1243
01:16:35,958 --> 01:16:37,893
Come on.
Get up, please.

1244
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:40,095
Come on. Let's go.

1245
01:16:52,007 --> 01:16:53,308
[camera shutter clicks]

1246
01:16:57,279 --> 01:16:59,114
Relax your hand, please.

1247
01:17:00,515 --> 01:17:03,151
Turn to the right.

1248
01:17:03,218 --> 01:17:04,186
[camera shutter clicks]

1249
01:17:16,031 --> 01:17:18,033
It's been days.

1250
01:17:18,100 --> 01:17:19,901
Where is he?

1251
01:17:22,471 --> 01:17:24,906
He would never abandon us.

1252
01:17:26,308 --> 01:17:28,710
We will die without him.

1253
01:17:34,383 --> 01:17:37,919
He's watching us.

1254
01:17:37,986 --> 01:17:40,288
He wants to make sure
of our devotion to him.

1255
01:17:40,355 --> 01:17:43,458
It's a test.
Oh, we are worthy of his love.

1256
01:17:43,525 --> 01:17:46,962
We are worthy of his love.
We are worthy of his love.

1257
01:17:47,029 --> 01:17:48,363
We haven't eaten in days.

1258
01:17:48,430 --> 01:17:51,099
I'm starving.

1259
01:17:51,166 --> 01:17:53,168
Stop being so selfish.

1260
01:17:55,137 --> 01:17:57,539
We are worthy of his love.
We are worthy of his love.

1261
01:17:57,606 --> 01:17:59,541
We are worthy of...
Say it!

1262
01:17:59,608 --> 01:18:02,811
We are worthy of his love.
We are worthy of his love.

1263
01:18:02,878 --> 01:18:06,448
We are worthy of his love.
We are worthy of his love.

1264
01:18:06,515 --> 01:18:08,383
We are worthy of his love.

1265
01:18:08,450 --> 01:18:10,419
We are worthy
of your love!

1266
01:18:10,485 --> 01:18:12,087
We are worthy
of your love!

1267
01:18:12,154 --> 01:18:14,289
That evening in the church,
Your Honor,

1268
01:18:14,356 --> 01:18:16,925
was the worst night
of my life.

1269
01:18:16,992 --> 01:18:19,528
I got drunk for the first time
in, what, 22 years?

1270
01:18:19,594 --> 01:18:22,297
This last week,
however, in jail

1271
01:18:22,364 --> 01:18:24,433
has been for me like Jonah

1272
01:18:24,499 --> 01:18:25,734
getting swallowed
by the whale.

1273
01:18:25,801 --> 01:18:29,104
It's turned me right around.
I know what I need to do,

1274
01:18:29,171 --> 01:18:31,306
what the Lord wants me to do
with my life.

1275
01:18:31,373 --> 01:18:34,409
And I'm...
[sighs]

1276
01:18:34,476 --> 01:18:37,112
I am terribly sorry.
Nothing like this

1277
01:18:37,179 --> 01:18:39,448
is ever going
to happen again.

1278
01:18:39,514 --> 01:18:41,817
Last week, we showed you
a sketch of a man

1279
01:18:41,883 --> 01:18:44,119
that might have taken
Elizabeth Smart.

1280
01:18:44,186 --> 01:18:45,587
Thanks to one of
our viewers calling in,

1281
01:18:45,654 --> 01:18:48,223
we've been able
to identify him.

1282
01:18:48,290 --> 01:18:51,059
His name
is Brian David Mitchell.

1283
01:18:51,126 --> 01:18:54,362
He calls himself Emmanuel
for religious reasons.

1284
01:18:54,429 --> 01:18:56,531
He is believed
to be traveling with his wife,

1285
01:18:56,598 --> 01:18:58,400
Wanda Barzee.

1286
01:18:58,467 --> 01:19:01,269
Cops stress
he is not a suspect.

1287
01:19:01,336 --> 01:19:03,972
They just wanna question him
in Elizabeth's disappearance.
[doorbell rings]

1288
01:19:08,310 --> 01:19:09,945
Yes?
Mr. Smart?

1289
01:19:10,011 --> 01:19:10,946
Yes.

1290
01:19:11,012 --> 01:19:12,481
My name is Stacey McGinty.

1291
01:19:12,547 --> 01:19:15,317
I'm a relative
of Brian Mitchell's.

1292
01:19:15,383 --> 01:19:18,353
Ah. Uh, please,
uh, come in.

1293
01:19:18,420 --> 01:19:21,623
No, thank you.
I can't stay.

1294
01:19:21,690 --> 01:19:24,526
I just wanted to come by
and tell you...

1295
01:19:26,027 --> 01:19:29,865
I don't know if Brian
is the one who took her or not.

1296
01:19:29,931 --> 01:19:32,234
If it his him,

1297
01:19:32,300 --> 01:19:34,035
she's still alive.

1298
01:19:35,237 --> 01:19:37,305
He doesn't kill them.

1299
01:19:37,372 --> 01:19:40,275
He murders their spirit

1300
01:19:40,342 --> 01:19:42,144
and takes their soul.

1301
01:20:00,428 --> 01:20:02,164
Excuse me.
Could you spare some change?

1302
01:20:02,230 --> 01:20:03,932
Ma'am, some change?

1303
01:20:03,999 --> 01:20:05,066
God bless you, sir.

1304
01:20:05,133 --> 01:20:07,102
Excuse me, sir.
Could you spare some change?

1305
01:20:07,169 --> 01:20:08,803
Can you spare some change?

1306
01:20:08,870 --> 01:20:12,007
[Man on phone]
911 operator.
What's your emergency?

1307
01:20:12,073 --> 01:20:15,243
[Woman]
Yes. Is this where I call if I
think I see that Emmanuel guy?

1308
01:20:15,310 --> 01:20:18,413
The guy they're looking for
in connection with the
Elizabeth Smart kidnapping case?

1309
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:19,614
Is he wearing robes?

1310
01:20:19,681 --> 01:20:22,517
No, but he's got
a big bushy beard and long hair.

1311
01:20:22,584 --> 01:20:23,952
Is he alone?

1312
01:20:24,019 --> 01:20:25,453
No, he was with two ladies,

1313
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:26,555
and they're carrying bedrolls.

1314
01:20:26,621 --> 01:20:28,256
How long ago did you see them?

1315
01:20:28,323 --> 01:20:30,158
I just saw them.

1316
01:20:30,225 --> 01:20:32,627
You, can you spare some change?

1317
01:20:32,694 --> 01:20:34,629
Sir, could you
spare some change?
Burn in hell.

1318
01:20:34,696 --> 01:20:37,599
Excuse me. Would you happen
to have some money for us?

1319
01:20:37,666 --> 01:20:39,201
Ma'am, would you happen
to have...
No!

1320
01:20:39,267 --> 01:20:40,769
[police radio chatter]

1321
01:20:40,835 --> 01:20:43,471
Can you spare some change,
ma'am?
Can you spare some change?

1322
01:20:43,538 --> 01:20:46,241
Burn in hell
the lot of you.

1323
01:20:46,308 --> 01:20:48,243
Good morning,
Officer.

1324
01:20:48,310 --> 01:20:50,345
Good morning.

1325
01:20:50,412 --> 01:20:52,280
Mmm. What's your name, sir?

1326
01:20:52,347 --> 01:20:54,282
Peter Marshall.

1327
01:20:54,349 --> 01:20:55,984
Can I see some ID, sir?

1328
01:20:56,051 --> 01:20:57,419
Oh, we're messengers of God.

1329
01:20:57,485 --> 01:20:58,753
We're free
of all worldly things.

1330
01:20:58,820 --> 01:21:00,322
Simply traveling the earth
spreading God's word.

1331
01:21:00,388 --> 01:21:03,425
My wife Juliette,
our daughter Augustine.

[car door opens]

[bells tolling]

1334
01:21:16,805 --> 01:21:19,140
Transients.
He says his name's
Peter Marshall,

1335
01:21:19,207 --> 01:21:21,109
but he doesn't have
any ID.

1336
01:21:21,176 --> 01:21:23,578
Augustine, you can't say a word.
You know that.

1337
01:21:23,645 --> 01:21:26,281
Let's just relax.
Hmm?
Mr. Marshall.

1338
01:21:26,348 --> 01:21:29,417
Can I talk to you
over here for a moment?
Absolutely.

1339
01:21:29,484 --> 01:21:32,621
Ma'am, you, too,
if you don't mind.

1340
01:21:32,687 --> 01:21:34,489
She'll be fine.

1341
01:21:39,127 --> 01:21:41,029
Can I ask your name?

1342
01:21:41,096 --> 01:21:44,399
My name is
Augustine Ann Marshall.

1343
01:21:44,466 --> 01:21:46,401
I'm traveling with
my mother and father.

1344
01:21:46,468 --> 01:21:49,104
We're from Miami,
Florida.

1345
01:21:49,170 --> 01:21:51,139
Where in Miami
do you live?

1346
01:21:51,206 --> 01:21:53,174
Just Miami.

1347
01:21:54,376 --> 01:21:56,011
Do you live
near the water?

1348
01:21:56,077 --> 01:21:57,545
Yes.

1349
01:22:01,316 --> 01:22:03,418
Why are you wearing a wig?

1350
01:22:03,485 --> 01:22:05,487
That's personal.

1351
01:22:08,323 --> 01:22:09,357
Can you tell me
your name?

1352
01:22:09,424 --> 01:22:12,594
My name is
Augustine Ann Marshall.

1353
01:22:12,661 --> 01:22:14,462
I'm traveling with
my mother and father.

1354
01:22:14,529 --> 01:22:16,431
Do you have
a place to stay?

1355
01:22:17,732 --> 01:22:19,434
We're from Miami,
Florida.

1356
01:22:20,702 --> 01:22:23,605
I'm not gonna let
anything happen to you.

1357
01:22:25,473 --> 01:22:27,342
Can you tell me
your name now?

1358
01:22:27,409 --> 01:22:29,511
My name is
Augustine Ann Marshall,

1359
01:22:29,577 --> 01:22:32,347
and we're from Miami,
Florida.

1360
01:22:33,815 --> 01:22:37,052
So you don't know
where in Miami you're from?

1361
01:22:37,118 --> 01:22:39,521
All I know is I said is that
we're ministers of God,

1362
01:22:39,587 --> 01:22:42,724
and we're traveling
to spread His word.

1363
01:22:42,791 --> 01:22:47,028
You know, Elizabeth,

1364
01:22:49,331 --> 01:22:52,133
there are a lot of people
looking for you

1365
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:54,469
and missing you.

1366
01:23:00,875 --> 01:23:03,078
[chattering]

1367
01:23:13,288 --> 01:23:15,423
You're safe now.

1368
01:23:15,490 --> 01:23:19,227
All you have to do
is tell me you're Elizabeth.

1369
01:23:22,430 --> 01:23:24,599
Thou sayeth.

1370
01:23:26,167 --> 01:23:28,370
I sayeth.

1371
01:23:34,175 --> 01:23:36,378
What's gonna happen
to them?

1372
01:23:36,444 --> 01:23:38,446
Will they be okay?

1373
01:23:44,652 --> 01:23:46,788
The police just called.

1374
01:23:46,855 --> 01:23:48,790
They want me to come down
to the station right away.

1375
01:23:48,857 --> 01:23:50,692
Why?
They wouldn't say.

1376
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:55,130
I think they may have found
Brian Mitchell.

Yes, it is.
This is Lois.

1384
01:24:19,788 --> 01:24:23,224
Uh, no.
You just missed him. He...

1385
01:24:28,730 --> 01:24:30,532
Told me what?

1386
01:24:33,435 --> 01:24:35,837
No. I... I don't know.

1387
01:24:43,978 --> 01:24:45,313
Charles!

1388
01:25:04,365 --> 01:25:06,534
Elizabeth?

1389
01:25:10,605 --> 01:25:12,740
[gasps]

1390
01:25:12,807 --> 01:25:15,743
Is it...
Is it really you?

1391
01:25:15,810 --> 01:25:17,579
Yes, Daddy.

1392
01:25:23,051 --> 01:25:25,620
Don't get your hopes up, Mom.

1393
01:25:25,687 --> 01:25:27,489
We've gone through this before,
and it wasn't her.

1394
01:25:27,555 --> 01:25:28,756
I know. I know.
Come on.

1395
01:25:48,610 --> 01:25:50,979
Oh...

1396
01:25:51,045 --> 01:25:53,414
Oh, my baby.

1397
01:26:06,895 --> 01:26:08,563
[crying]

1398
01:26:17,438 --> 01:26:19,507
I can't believe
it's really you.

1399
01:26:33,821 --> 01:26:35,623
[mutters]

1400
01:26:39,894 --> 01:26:41,829
I knew it.

1401
01:26:46,100 --> 01:26:48,903
[crying]

1402
01:26:56,644 --> 01:26:58,980
[applause, cheering]
