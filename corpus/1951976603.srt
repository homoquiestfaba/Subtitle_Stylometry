1
00:00:51,484 --> 00:00:53,007
Thank you.
Thank you.

2
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,319
Thank you.

3
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:57,083
I'd like to begin -
I'd like to -

4
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:58,317
Thank you. Thank you.

5
00:01:01,161 --> 00:01:04,653
I'd like to begin by saying
fuck Lance Armstrong.

6
00:01:09,669 --> 00:01:10,727
Fuck him and his balls

7
00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:12,704
and his bicycles
and his steroids

8
00:01:12,772 --> 00:01:14,205
and his yellow shirts

9
00:01:14,274 --> 00:01:16,435
and the dumb empty
expression on his face.

10
00:01:16,509 --> 00:01:18,636
I'm tired of that asshole.

11
00:01:20,447 --> 00:01:23,905
And while you're at it
fuck Tiger Woods too.

12
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:31,618
There's another jack-off
I can do without.

13
00:01:31,691 --> 00:01:34,489
I'm tired of being told who
to admire in this country.

14
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:37,894
Aren't you sick of being told
who your heroes ought to be?

15
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:41,994
Being told who you ought
to be looking up to.

16
00:01:42,068 --> 00:01:45,037
I'll choose my own heroes,
thank you very much.

17
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:47,733
And fuck Dr. Phil too.

18
00:01:57,851 --> 00:02:00,251
Dr. Phil said
I should express my emotions,

19
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,185
so that's what I'm doing.

20
00:02:03,923 --> 00:02:06,858
Now, since the last time I
rolled through these parts -

21
00:02:06,926 --> 00:02:09,190
and I do roll through
with some frequency.

22
00:02:09,262 --> 00:02:13,494
I'm a little bit like herpes.
I keep coming back.

23
00:02:13,566 --> 00:02:16,091
But since the last time I might
have seen some of you folks

24
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:20,697
I have had my 70th birthday.
So I'm at -

25
00:02:20,773 --> 00:02:23,503
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

26
00:02:23,576 --> 00:02:25,237
Thank you.

27
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:29,042
Yeah, I'm now 70 years old,
and I like 70.

28
00:02:29,115 --> 00:02:31,549
Not as much as I liked 69.

29
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:36,653
Well, 69 was always
my favorite number.

30
00:02:36,723 --> 00:02:40,784
Now I figure I'm 69
with one finger up my ass.

31
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:49,759
But now that I'm an old fuck

32
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:51,895
- and that's what I
consider myself to be -

33
00:02:51,971 --> 00:02:53,495
an old fuck.

34
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:55,541
Old fuck is a very special term.

35
00:02:55,608 --> 00:02:56,973
It's not like old man.

36
00:02:57,043 --> 00:02:58,374
Old man is different.

37
00:02:58,444 --> 00:03:02,073
Old man isn't really a time in
your life or a period of years.

38
00:03:02,148 --> 00:03:04,479
It's an attitude.
Old man is a point of view.

39
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,050
It's a way of looking at things.

40
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:08,485
Some guys are old men when
they're in their 20's.

41
00:03:08,555 --> 00:03:11,649
You've met guys like that.
They're just wired like old men.

42
00:03:11,724 --> 00:03:12,383
Not me.

43
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:14,551
Not an old man
and not an old fart

44
00:03:14,627 --> 00:03:19,155
because an old fart is kind of -
<i>(Grumbles)</i>

45
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:21,666
What I am is an old fuck.

46
00:03:21,734 --> 00:03:25,295
It's kind of like a fat fuck,
you know what I mean?

47
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:28,602
Fat fuck, tall fuck,
skinny fuck, short fuck,

48
00:03:28,675 --> 00:03:30,165
old fuck.
Who's the old fuck?

49
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:33,770
That's Georgie.
Georgie's the old fuck.

50
00:03:33,846 --> 00:03:38,681
In this respect, fuck is actually
a synonym for the word fellow.

51
00:03:40,987 --> 00:03:43,080
But now that I'm an old fuck
I'm beginning to notice

52
00:03:43,156 --> 00:03:46,284
there's some advantages to
putting on a few extra years.

53
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:47,758
The first one is

54
00:03:47,827 --> 00:03:51,524
you never have to carry
anything heavy ever again.

55
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:54,726
Everybody wants to
help an old fuck.

56
00:03:54,801 --> 00:03:56,826
If you've got a big suitcase or
something like that, you know,

57
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,427
you just kind of go
like this a little bit.

58
00:03:58,504 --> 00:04:00,131
You say, "Yeah, could
you help me with this?"

59
00:04:00,206 --> 00:04:01,332
Say, "Yeah.
Hey, how far you going?"

60
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:02,999
"Indianapolis."

61
00:04:04,477 --> 00:04:07,469
He wants to help?
Fuck him. Put him to work.

62
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:10,674
Take advantage of people.

63
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,217
Another nice thing about
getting old is

64
00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:18,952
you can leave any social event
early just by saying you're tired.

65
00:04:19,025 --> 00:04:21,585
Works great
with family members.

66
00:04:21,661 --> 00:04:22,958
Just turn to the person
next to you and say,

67
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:25,657
"Geez, I'm getting tired,
you know."

68
00:04:25,732 --> 00:04:27,030
Oh, are you tired?
Come on.

69
00:04:27,031 --> 00:04:28,792
Grandpa's tired.
Grandpa's going to bed.

70
00:04:28,868 --> 00:04:31,837
Someone else says,
"But it's 7:30 in the morning."

71
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:36,738
There's always one
asshole in the family.

72
00:04:36,809 --> 00:04:39,004
But the best thing about
getting old is

73
00:04:39,078 --> 00:04:43,139
you're not responsible for
remembering things anymore,

74
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:45,116
even important things.

75
00:04:45,184 --> 00:04:47,550
"But it was your
daughter's funeral."

76
00:04:51,691 --> 00:04:53,158
I forgot.

77
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:57,454
You can even make believe you
have Alzheimer's disease.

78
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:59,259
Ah, it's a lot of fun.

79
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:01,197
You look around the dining
room table and you say,

80
00:05:01,267 --> 00:05:03,758
"Who are you people,
and where is my horse?"

81
00:05:06,205 --> 00:05:08,435
Then you stare at your
eldest son and say,

82
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:12,035
"Agnes, I haven't seen you
since first communion."

83
00:05:12,111 --> 00:05:13,840
Fucks them up.

84
00:05:14,747 --> 00:05:17,341
Fucks them up.
They don't know how to handle it.

85
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:20,284
It takes them a week
to get over that shit.

86
00:05:20,353 --> 00:05:24,153
And they start listening to you
a lot more carefully from then on.

87
00:05:24,223 --> 00:05:26,885
So don't be afraid to get old.
It's a great time of life.

88
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:28,688
You get to take
advantage of people,

89
00:05:28,761 --> 00:05:32,026
and you're not
responsible for anything.

90
00:05:32,098 --> 00:05:34,566
You can even
shit in your pants.

91
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:43,068
They expect it.

92
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:46,040
I haven't tried that yet,

93
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:48,444
but I don't rule it out.

94
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:50,982
I'm keeping my options open.

95
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:53,416
Everything is on the table.

96
00:05:55,621 --> 00:05:59,079
Perhaps that's not the figure
of speech I wanted right there.

97
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:01,519
So you know what
I've been doing?

98
00:06:01,594 --> 00:06:05,826
Going through my address book
and crossing out the dead people.

99
00:06:05,898 --> 00:06:08,128
You do that?
That's a lot of fun, isn't it?

100
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:11,967
It gives you a good feeling.
Kind of gives you a feeling of power,

101
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:15,906
a superiority to have
outlasted another old friend.

102
00:06:15,975 --> 00:06:19,502
But you can't do it too soon, you know?
You can't do it too soon.

103
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:21,570
You can't come running
home from the funeral

104
00:06:21,571 --> 00:06:23,606
and get the book out and
be looking through it.

105
00:06:24,283 --> 00:06:27,047
You can't do that.
A little time has to pass.

106
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,815
You have to let a
little time go by.

107
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:31,755
I have a rule of thumb -
six weeks.

108
00:06:31,824 --> 00:06:34,224
If you're a friend of mine and
you're in my book and you die,

109
00:06:34,293 --> 00:06:37,057
I leave you alone
for an extra six weeks.

110
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:40,759
Six extra weeks in the book.
On the house. It's on me.

111
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:42,824
But after that,
hey, facts are facts.

112
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:44,301
Fuck you. You're dead.

113
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:51,240
Out you fucking go.

114
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:54,210
You got to have
standards, you know.

115
00:06:55,381 --> 00:06:59,181
Now, these days a lot of people don't
keep analog address books anymore.

116
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,686
They don't want to be writing
that stuff out longhand.

117
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:03,119
They're in the computer age.

118
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:06,124
And they have an application in
the computer called Outlook

119
00:07:06,192 --> 00:07:09,093
or Contacts or Address Book
or something like that.

120
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:11,630
So they keep all the
information in the computer,

121
00:07:11,697 --> 00:07:14,222
and they sync it up with their
phone every day or every other day.

122
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,825
So now instead of
scratching out a name

123
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:19,303
you get to delete the fuck.

124
00:07:20,573 --> 00:07:24,202
And deleting someone is an even
more powerful feeling

125
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,336
than simply
scratching out a name.

126
00:07:26,412 --> 00:07:28,141
You know how to delete someone.

127
00:07:28,214 --> 00:07:30,045
You select a name,

128
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,743
highlight the person

129
00:07:31,818 --> 00:07:34,150
and then poof,

130
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,650
straight into the trash.

131
00:07:38,357 --> 00:07:40,621
Now, if it's a really close
friend of yours

132
00:07:40,693 --> 00:07:44,390
you might not want to empty
the trash for about six weeks.

133
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:50,899
Or, if it's a
little too harsh for you,

134
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,598
a little too harsh to
delete an old friend,

135
00:07:53,673 --> 00:07:56,665
you can always
create a new folder,

136
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:00,811
a special folder
for dead people.

137
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:04,009
You keep it on your desktop.

138
00:08:04,884 --> 00:08:07,717
It's kind of a
digital purgatory.

139
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:20,358
And the nice thing
is every now and then

140
00:08:20,359 --> 00:08:22,658
you can open it up,
and you can look inside.

141
00:08:22,735 --> 00:08:24,259
And you can see the
people in purgatory.

142
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,999
You can move them all around,
you know. Move them around.

143
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:29,507
Put them in little groups.
Two people who didn't get along in life,

144
00:08:29,575 --> 00:08:31,440
put them in the corner;
let them work it out.

145
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:32,773
Let them work out in purgatory.

146
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:34,842
Or start a fight.
Have a big fight in purgatory.

147
00:08:34,843 --> 00:08:35,575
That's a lot of fun.

148
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:39,550
Nobody's gonna get hurt.
They're a fucking dead anyway.

149
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:43,555
Then you put them in a big
formation and have a parade -

150
00:08:43,623 --> 00:08:46,786
the purgatory parade
of dead people.

151
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:50,955
Ah, there's a lot of fun you
can have with a computer,

152
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,794
so enjoy your digital selves.

153
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:57,030
Now, speaking of dead people,

154
00:08:57,103 --> 00:08:59,936
there things we say
when someone dies -

155
00:09:00,006 --> 00:09:01,906
most of us say,
a lot of us do -

156
00:09:01,974 --> 00:09:04,465
things we say
that no one ever questions.

157
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,535
They just kind of go unexamined.

158
00:09:06,612 --> 00:09:08,580
I'll give you a
couple of examples.

159
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:13,017
After someone dies the following
conversation is bound to take place

160
00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:14,916
probably more than once.

161
00:09:14,987 --> 00:09:16,579
Two guys meet on the street.

162
00:09:16,656 --> 00:09:19,318
"Hey, did you hear?
Phil Davis died."

163
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:20,882
"Phil Davis?

164
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,986
I just saw him yesterday."

165
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:26,031
Yeah?

166
00:09:26,098 --> 00:09:27,588
Didn't help.

167
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:31,732
He died anyway.

168
00:09:31,804 --> 00:09:37,003
Apparently the simple act of your
seeing him did not slow his cancer down.

169
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:40,637
In fact, it may have
made it more aggressive.

170
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:44,547
You know, you could be
responsible for Phil's death.

171
00:09:44,617 --> 00:09:48,576
How do you live with yourself?

172
00:09:48,654 --> 00:09:50,383
Here's another thing
they say after a death.

173
00:09:50,456 --> 00:09:54,051
This is usually said to
the surviving spouse.

174
00:09:54,126 --> 00:09:58,586
"Listen, if there's anything
I can do, anything at all,

175
00:09:58,664 --> 00:10:02,760
please don't hesitate to ask."

176
00:10:02,835 --> 00:10:05,531
What are you going to
do, a resurrection?

177
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:08,130
This ain't the fucking
New Testament, you know.

178
00:10:08,207 --> 00:10:10,266
You know what you tell a guy
like that who wants to help?

179
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:12,719
Well fine, why don't you
come over this weekend.

180
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,835
You can paint the garage.

181
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:17,139
Bring your plunger.
The upstairs toilet overflowed

182
00:10:17,216 --> 00:10:20,151
and there's shit
all over the floor up there.

183
00:10:20,219 --> 00:10:22,084
Do you drive a tractor?
Good. That'll come in handy.

184
00:10:22,154 --> 00:10:24,850
The north 40 needs
a lot of attention.

185
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:26,357
Bring your chainsaw
and your pickaxe.

186
00:10:26,425 --> 00:10:28,859
We're going to put
your ass to work.

187
00:10:28,928 --> 00:10:32,420
He wants to help?
Fuck him. Call his bluff.

188
00:10:32,498 --> 00:10:35,126
Call his bluff.
"Don't hesitate to ask."

189
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:37,032
The nerve of these pricks.

190
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:43,406
Here's another thing we say
to the surviving spouse.

191
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:47,071
"I'm keeping him
in my thoughts."

192
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:48,636
Where?

193
00:10:49,515 --> 00:10:52,678
Where exactly in your
thoughts does he fit?

194
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:56,279
In between my ass hurt in this
chair and let's fuck the waitress?

195
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:04,520
What are your priorities?

196
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:10,363
We use a lot of euphemisms when
we talk about death, you know.

197
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:14,566
People say things like,
"You know, I lost my father."

198
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,631
Ah, he'll turn up.

199
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:21,177
You've got to stay optimistic
with people like that.

200
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:22,737
Give them reason to hope.

201
00:11:22,815 --> 00:11:25,784
Have you checked the
dumpster out back?

202
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:28,649
He used to like to
take a nap in there.

203
00:11:28,721 --> 00:11:30,313
Keep it upbeat.

204
00:11:31,424 --> 00:11:36,418
Now, there's something else
that is said after a death,

205
00:11:37,763 --> 00:11:41,859
but this one involves belief,

206
00:11:41,934 --> 00:11:44,664
which is where I begin to have

207
00:11:44,737 --> 00:11:46,728
big problems.

208
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:51,832
This one happens after the funeral,
after the burial, back at the house.

209
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:53,469
Back at the house

210
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,571
where the family
and friends and the loved ones

211
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:58,310
of the deceased are
having some food and drink,

212
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:00,993
and they're enjoying
some warm reminiscences

213
00:12:00,994 --> 00:12:02,616
of the person who passed away,

214
00:12:02,688 --> 00:12:05,748
sooner or later, someone is
bound to say the following,

215
00:12:05,825 --> 00:12:09,591
especially after a few drinks.

216
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:17,330
"You know, I think he's up
there now smiling down at us,

217
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:20,566
and I think he's pleased."

218
00:12:26,112 --> 00:12:29,775
Now, first of all,

219
00:12:29,849 --> 00:12:33,080
there is no "up there"

220
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:36,917
no, no

221
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:43,050
for people to be
smiling down from.

222
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:54,003
It's poetic. It's quaint.

223
00:12:54,073 --> 00:12:58,169
And I guess for superstitious
people it provides a little comfort,

224
00:12:58,244 --> 00:13:00,109
but it doesn't exist.

225
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:02,272
But if it did, if it did,

226
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:06,648
and if someone did somehow survive
death in the non-physical form,

227
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:11,315
I personally think he'd be far too
busy with other celestial activities

228
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:13,756
than to be
standing around paradise

229
00:13:13,826 --> 00:13:15,885
smiling down

230
00:13:25,204 --> 00:13:26,899
on live people.

231
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:29,964
What kind of fucking
eternity is that?

232
00:13:31,076 --> 00:13:36,742
And why is no one ever says,
"I think he's down there now,

233
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:39,876
smiling up at us."

234
00:13:39,952 --> 00:13:44,980
Apparently it never occurs to people
that their loved ones might be in hell.

235
00:13:45,057 --> 00:13:47,355
Your parents could
be in hell right now.

236
00:13:47,426 --> 00:13:50,361
Your parents -
your father for sure.

237
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:54,364
Oh, shit.
Hell is full of dads.

238
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:58,802
Full of dads - even the ones
that took you to the ballgame -

239
00:13:58,871 --> 00:14:02,272
just for beating the shit
out of you once too often

240
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:06,175
and fucking the neighbor lady

241
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:09,840
and fucking the neighbor dog,

242
00:14:09,915 --> 00:14:14,943
and who knows,
maybe even fucking the UPS man.

243
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:18,649
We'll never know what
mischief dad was up to.

244
00:14:19,258 --> 00:14:21,123
Parents in hell.

245
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:24,458
It kind of gives you a
nice feeling, doesn't it?

246
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:27,158
It does me.

247
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:29,098
Grandparents in hell.

248
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:30,499
Picture that.

249
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:33,265
Picture your grandmother in hell

250
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:35,534
baking pies

251
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:37,633
without an oven.

252
00:14:40,412 --> 00:14:42,277
And if someone were in hell,

253
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:46,409
I doubt very seriously
he'd be smiling.

254
00:14:46,485 --> 00:14:50,717
I think he's down there
now screaming up at us,

255
00:14:50,789 --> 00:14:53,553
and I think he's in severe pain.

256
00:14:54,193 --> 00:14:57,094
People just refuse
to be realistic.

257
00:14:57,162 --> 00:14:59,187
They don't like to be realistic.

258
00:14:59,265 --> 00:15:02,757
People would rather
stroke themselves, you know.

259
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:04,860
Oh, they like to stroke
themselves, don't they?

260
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:06,632
Stroke themselves.
They stroke each other.

261
00:15:06,705 --> 00:15:07,501
They get stroked.

262
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:09,234
They stroke the boss.
The boss strokes them.

263
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:10,433
Everybody strokes everybody.

264
00:15:10,434 --> 00:15:12,402
It's nothing but a big
stroke job in this country.

265
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:14,070
The government strokes you
every day of your life.

266
00:15:14,146 --> 00:15:15,841
Religion never
stops stroking you.

267
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,280
Big business gives
you a good stroke.

268
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:19,394
And it's one big, transcontinental,

269
00:15:19,395 --> 00:15:22,082
cross-country, red,
white and blue stroke job.

270
00:15:22,154 --> 00:15:24,054
Do you know -

271
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:25,784
yeah. Yeah.

272
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:34,097
Do you know what the national
emblem for this country ought to be?

273
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:35,758
Forget that bald eagle.

274
00:15:35,834 --> 00:15:37,995
The national emblem of this
country ought to be

275
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:41,267
Uncle Sam standing naked
at attention saluting.

276
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:44,002
And seated on a chair
next to him

277
00:15:44,076 --> 00:15:46,544
the Statue of Liberty
jerking him off.

278
00:15:53,018 --> 00:15:57,182
That would be a good symbol for
the United Strokes of America.

279
00:15:58,324 --> 00:16:00,258
It's all bullshit folks.

280
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:02,385
It's all bullshit,
and it's bad for you.

281
00:16:03,862 --> 00:16:06,763
Now, speaking of dead
people in heaven,

282
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:14,338
there are some people
who not only believe

283
00:16:14,406 --> 00:16:18,604
that their dead parents
in heaven can see them

284
00:16:18,677 --> 00:16:20,770
- okay,

285
00:16:20,846 --> 00:16:22,370
okay -

286
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:29,686
they honestly believe that their
dead parents in heaven can help them.

287
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:32,349
You've heard these
people, I'm sure.

288
00:16:32,424 --> 00:16:35,291
They honestly somehow believe
that their dead parents in heaven

289
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:39,525
can intercede with God on their
behalf to gain favors for the living.

290
00:16:39,598 --> 00:16:44,433
I come from a Catholic home.
I heard this shit.

291
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:46,471
They sit there in the chair
with the fucking rosary,

292
00:16:46,538 --> 00:16:47,835
and they look at you
like this, you know.

293
00:16:47,906 --> 00:16:50,067
And they said "Oh, my dad.
My dad was looking out for me.

294
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:50,807
He was looking out.

295
00:16:50,808 --> 00:16:52,940
I don't know how he got me out
of that jam, but he got me out.

296
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:55,412
Oh, my mom - my mom
was in surgery with me.

297
00:16:55,481 --> 00:16:57,506
She was in - I could feel
her presence in there."

298
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:59,744
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

299
00:16:59,818 --> 00:17:02,514
Fine.

300
00:17:02,588 --> 00:17:04,579
Like the people who die
have nothing better to do

301
00:17:04,656 --> 00:17:08,649
than run the heavenly branch
of the Make-A-Wish Foundation.

302
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:12,860
Now,

303
00:17:12,931 --> 00:17:14,421
if people want to believe
this kind of stuff

304
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,024
it's fine with me.
Let them believe it.

305
00:17:16,101 --> 00:17:19,366
I don't want to disabuse
anyone of their beliefs.

306
00:17:19,438 --> 00:17:22,134
But I have a
question about this,

307
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:26,109
a question that involves logic.

308
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,203
Let's suppose it's true.

309
00:17:29,281 --> 00:17:31,459
Let's allow the
proposition that somehow

310
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:34,275
dead parents in heaven can
help their living children.

311
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:34,944
Fine.

312
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:38,285
So we've got a family living on earth,
a father and mother and four kids.

313
00:17:38,357 --> 00:17:39,221
A family of six.

314
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:40,359
A good family.
A nice family.

315
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,089
Doing all the right things,
having a good time,

316
00:17:42,161 --> 00:17:43,185
making all the right moves.

317
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:47,995
And the parents go away on a weekend
trip and get killed in an accident,

318
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,659
and the children,
of course, survive.

319
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:51,259
So now, according
to this theory,

320
00:17:51,336 --> 00:17:53,201
these two people go to heaven

321
00:17:53,272 --> 00:17:55,502
and they start helping
their four living children,

322
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:56,905
helping them
with everything they need.

323
00:17:56,975 --> 00:17:59,876
Helping them with their science
projects, with their SAT scores.

324
00:17:59,945 --> 00:18:02,743
Helping them get a good
school, get a nice job,

325
00:18:02,815 --> 00:18:04,917
get a promotion and a
raise and someone to marry,

326
00:18:04,918 --> 00:18:05,716
and they all grow up.

327
00:18:05,784 --> 00:18:08,947
These four kids now grow up
and have children of their own.

328
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:11,702
And let's say that
all four of these

329
00:18:11,703 --> 00:18:14,891
now-grown children also
die at the same time,

330
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,123
just for the sake of argument.

331
00:18:18,197 --> 00:18:21,826
Let's say there's an explosion
at Thanksgiving dinner,

332
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:28,304
and these four die,
but their children survive

333
00:18:28,373 --> 00:18:31,968
because they were seated
at the children's table.

334
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:34,703
So -

335
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:38,544
So now, according to the theory,

336
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:41,586
these four go to heaven and they
start helping their living children.

337
00:18:41,653 --> 00:18:43,450
But what happens to
the original two?

338
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:46,286
What happens to the grandparents?
Do they just go off-duty now?

339
00:18:46,358 --> 00:18:47,120
What do they do?

340
00:18:47,192 --> 00:18:49,490
Is there a retirement
program up there?

341
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:51,153
Is there some activities
for these people?

342
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:53,460
Shuffleboard,
pinball, online poker.

343
00:18:53,532 --> 00:18:55,090
There must be
something they can do.

344
00:18:55,167 --> 00:18:57,635
Or do they have to remain
on duty indefinitely?

345
00:18:57,703 --> 00:18:59,083
Do they have to keep on helping

346
00:18:59,084 --> 00:19:01,264
their living decedents
forever and ever and ever?

347
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,604
Is that what heaven is all
about, helping the living?

348
00:19:03,675 --> 00:19:05,336
When do you get to just
lie back on a cloud

349
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:09,278
and take a fucking harp lesson,
you know what I mean?

350
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:14,445
Because people have been
dying for a long, long time.

351
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,476
There's been a lot of
dead mother-fuckers.

352
00:19:16,477 --> 00:19:17,250
Did you know that?

353
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:19,415
Yes, you knew there's a
lot of dead mother-fuckers.

354
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:21,755
We've had 100 billion
people live on this earth.

355
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:23,021
That's what the experts say.

356
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:24,756
A hundred billion
people have lived here.

357
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,491
So let's say half of them
died and went to heaven.

358
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:28,123
That's 50 billion
people up there.

359
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,424
That's a pretty crowded place.

360
00:19:29,425 --> 00:19:31,465
It must get pretty busy
and pretty hectic up there.

361
00:19:31,537 --> 00:19:34,370
And God must get pretty pissed
off with all these favors.

362
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:36,134
"Yeah, yeah, I know.
Spelling test Tuesday.

363
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:38,005
Get the fuck out of here,
would you, please?

364
00:19:38,076 --> 00:19:39,941
Just get the fuck out of here."

365
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:52,118
Well, even God can go on
sensory overload.

366
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:55,422
That's why he wanted
one day off a week.

367
00:19:55,494 --> 00:19:57,359
Christians gave him Sunday.

368
00:19:57,429 --> 00:19:59,158
Jews gave him Saturday.

369
00:19:59,231 --> 00:20:01,631
Muslims gave him Friday.

370
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,464
God has a three-day weekend,

371
00:20:06,738 --> 00:20:08,638
which is probably
just what he needs.

372
00:20:09,274 --> 00:20:12,175
Now, just a couple of other
questions about this whole theory.

373
00:20:12,244 --> 00:20:16,578
Suppose you die without
having any children.

374
00:20:16,648 --> 00:20:18,673
Who do you help,

375
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,650
strangers?

376
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:23,119
It would be nice.

377
00:20:23,188 --> 00:20:26,282
Suppose you're an adopted child.

378
00:20:26,358 --> 00:20:28,588
Who helps you,

379
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,525
your biological mother?

380
00:20:30,596 --> 00:20:33,565
She doesn't even know
where the fuck you live.

381
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:44,198
Suppose you kill your parents.

382
00:20:48,947 --> 00:20:51,313
Would they help you?

383
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:56,685
I'll guarantee you Mr. and Mrs. Menendez
are not helping those two boys.

384
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:58,916
No. No.

385
00:21:06,064 --> 00:21:09,192
Yeah, it's all bullshit folks,
and it's bad for you.

386
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:09,825
It's all bullshit.

387
00:21:09,901 --> 00:21:12,199
That's what you have to remember as
you go through life in this country.

388
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,865
It's all bullshit,
and it's bad for you.

389
00:21:16,241 --> 00:21:20,405
Now, speaking of parents
and peaking of bullshit -

390
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:23,971
two ideas which aren't always
mutually exclusive, by the way -

391
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:26,244
I'd like to mention
a special kind of bullshit

392
00:21:26,318 --> 00:21:30,516
that has taken hold in this
country in the last 30 to 40 years.

393
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:33,990
It's a form of bullshit that
really only can be called

394
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:35,321
child worship.

395
00:21:35,394 --> 00:21:37,191
It's child worship.

396
00:21:37,262 --> 00:21:41,460
It's this excessive
devotion to children.

397
00:21:41,533 --> 00:21:44,991
I'm talking about today's
professional parents,

398
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:49,803
these obsessive diaper sniffers,

399
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:52,742
who are over-scheduling and
over-managing their children

400
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:55,279
and robbing them
of their childhoods.

401
00:21:55,347 --> 00:21:58,145
Even the simple act of playing -

402
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:09,756
Even the simple act of playing
has been taken away from children

403
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:13,628
and put on mommy's schedule
in the form of play dates.

404
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:16,463
Something that should be
spontaneous and free

405
00:22:16,535 --> 00:22:19,561
is now being rigidly planned.

406
00:22:19,638 --> 00:22:24,769
When does a kid ever get to sit
in the yard with a stick anymore?

407
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:29,246
You know, just sit there
with a fucking stick.

408
00:22:29,314 --> 00:22:33,717
Do today's kids even
know what a stick is?

409
00:22:33,785 --> 00:22:35,150
You know.

410
00:22:37,122 --> 00:22:40,182
You sit in the yard
with a fucking stick

411
00:22:40,258 --> 00:22:44,024
and you dig a fucking hole.

412
00:22:44,096 --> 00:22:45,620
You know.

413
00:22:52,404 --> 00:22:55,999
And you look at the hole,
and you look at the stick,

414
00:22:56,074 --> 00:22:58,565
and you have a little fun.

415
00:22:58,643 --> 00:23:00,941
But kids don't
have sticks anymore.

416
00:23:01,012 --> 00:23:03,742
I don't think there
are any sticks left.

417
00:23:03,815 --> 00:23:08,184
I think they've all been
recalled because of lead paint.

418
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:11,466
Who would have thought that one day

419
00:23:11,467 --> 00:23:15,057
the manufacturing of sticks
would be outsourced to China?

420
00:23:15,127 --> 00:23:18,756
But you know something, a kid shouldn't
be wasting his time with a stick anyway.

421
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:20,889
If he's 4 years old
he should be home

422
00:23:20,966 --> 00:23:24,868
studying for his
kindergarten entrance exams.

423
00:23:24,936 --> 00:23:27,461
Do you know about that shit?
Oh, they have them now. Yeah. Yeah.

424
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:30,736
There are places that have
kindergarten entrance exams.

425
00:23:30,809 --> 00:23:33,300
The poor little fuck.

426
00:23:33,378 --> 00:23:37,178
The poor little fuck,
he can barely locate his dick,

427
00:23:40,152 --> 00:23:44,782
you know, and already he's
being pressured to succeed.

428
00:23:44,856 --> 00:23:48,155
Pressured to succeed for
the sake of the parents.

429
00:23:48,226 --> 00:23:52,424
Isn't this really just a
sophisticated form of child abuse?

430
00:23:52,497 --> 00:23:55,796
And speaking of that,
speaking of child abuse -

431
00:24:01,206 --> 00:24:04,539
speaking of child abuse,
next stop grade school.

432
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:07,452
Grade school where
he won't be allowed

433
00:24:07,453 --> 00:24:10,878
to play tag because it
encourages victimization.

434
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:15,181
And he won't be allowed to play
dodge ball because it's exclusionary,

435
00:24:15,253 --> 00:24:16,618
and it promotes aggression.

436
00:24:16,688 --> 00:24:18,849
Standing around is still okay.

437
00:24:18,924 --> 00:24:22,018
Standing around is still
permitted, but it won't be for long

438
00:24:22,093 --> 00:24:24,844
because sooner or later some kid
is gonna be standing around,

439
00:24:24,845 --> 00:24:26,086
and his foot will fall asleep,

440
00:24:26,164 --> 00:24:27,722
and his parents
will sue the school,

441
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:30,996
and it'll be goodbye
fucking standing around.

442
00:24:39,744 --> 00:24:42,338
Now fortunately all is not lost.

443
00:24:42,414 --> 00:24:45,349
All is not lost
because at least we know

444
00:24:45,417 --> 00:24:47,036
that when he does get to play,

445
00:24:47,037 --> 00:24:48,978
whatever games he
is allowed to play,

446
00:24:49,054 --> 00:24:50,954
the child will never lose.

447
00:24:51,022 --> 00:24:53,786
We know he'll never lose
because in today's America

448
00:24:53,859 --> 00:24:55,850
no child ever loses.

449
00:24:55,927 --> 00:24:57,588
There are no losers anymore.

450
00:24:57,662 --> 00:24:58,856
Everyone's a winner,

451
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:02,457
no matter what the game or sport
or competition, everybody wins.

452
00:25:02,534 --> 00:25:04,934
Everybody wins.
Everybody gets a trophy.

453
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:06,197
No one is a loser.

454
00:25:06,271 --> 00:25:10,901
No child these days ever gets to those
all-important character building words,

455
00:25:10,976 --> 00:25:13,877
"You lost, Bobby.

456
00:25:13,945 --> 00:25:17,210
You lost.
You're a loser, Bobby."

457
00:25:17,282 --> 00:25:19,750
They miss out on that.

458
00:25:19,818 --> 00:25:22,252
You know what they tell a
kid who lost these days?

459
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,880
"You were the last winner."

460
00:25:28,426 --> 00:25:32,057
A lot of these kids never get to
hear the truth about themselves

461
00:25:32,058 --> 00:25:33,454
until they're in their 20's

462
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:35,056
when the boss
calls them in and says,

463
00:25:35,133 --> 00:25:37,018
"Bobby, clean the
shit out of your desk

464
00:25:37,019 --> 00:25:39,092
and get the fuck out of here.
You're a loser.

465
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:40,865
Get the fuck out of here."

466
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:53,245
Of course, Bobby's parents can't
understand why he can't hold a job.

467
00:25:53,318 --> 00:25:55,752
In school he was always
on the honor roll.

468
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:58,721
Well, what they don't understand,
of course, is that in today's schools

469
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:01,122
everyone is on the honor roll.

470
00:26:01,192 --> 00:26:04,719
Everyone is on the honor roll because
in order to be in the honor roll,

471
00:26:04,796 --> 00:26:07,422
all you really need
to do is to maintain

472
00:26:07,423 --> 00:26:10,496
a body temperature somewhere
roughly in the 90's.

473
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:14,163
But we shouldn't be worrying
about how he's doing in school

474
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:17,606
because you know come summertime
he'll be off to camp.

475
00:26:17,676 --> 00:26:19,303
Yes, he'll be off to camp,

476
00:26:19,377 --> 00:26:22,710
but not to swim and hike
and play softball. No, no, no.

477
00:26:22,781 --> 00:26:25,579
Today's child will be
sent away to lose weight.

478
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:27,641
He'll be sent away to fat camp

479
00:26:27,719 --> 00:26:30,017
or violin camp or ceramics camp

480
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:35,025
or computer camp or leadership
camp, whatever the fuck that is.

481
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:38,756
Leadership camp.
Isn't that where Hitler went?

482
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:49,634
Specialized,
structured summer camps.

483
00:26:49,708 --> 00:26:52,040
Gotta keep the little
fucker busy, don't they?

484
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:54,135
Gotta keep the
little fucker busy.

485
00:26:54,212 --> 00:26:57,841
Wouldn't want him to sneak in a
little unstructured time in the woods.

486
00:26:57,916 --> 00:26:59,543
That wouldn't be any good.

487
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:02,485
God knows he might
start jacking off.

488
00:27:04,889 --> 00:27:09,417
Now, all of this stupid bullshit
that children have been so crippled by

489
00:27:09,494 --> 00:27:14,193
has grown out of something
called the self-esteem movement.

490
00:27:14,265 --> 00:27:17,428
The self-esteem
movement began in 1970,

491
00:27:17,502 --> 00:27:21,734
and I'm happy to say it has
been a complete failure

492
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:24,900
because studies
have repeatedly shown

493
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:28,468
that having high self-esteem
does not improve grades,

494
00:27:28,546 --> 00:27:30,673
does not improve
career achievement.

495
00:27:30,749 --> 00:27:33,013
It does not even lower
the use of alcohol.

496
00:27:33,084 --> 00:27:37,043
And it most certainly does not reduce
the incidence of violence of any sort

497
00:27:37,122 --> 00:27:40,683
because as it turns out,
extremely aggressive, violent people

498
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:42,954
think very highly of themselves.

499
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:50,632
Imagine that, sociopath's
have high self-esteem.

500
00:27:50,702 --> 00:27:52,761
Who woulda thunk, huh?

501
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:54,168
I love when this kind
of thing happens.

502
00:27:54,239 --> 00:27:57,122
I love when these
politically correct ideas

503
00:27:57,123 --> 00:27:59,939
crash and burn and wind
up in the shithouse.

504
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:02,878
Here's another one
that bit the dust.

505
00:28:02,947 --> 00:28:06,678
This practice of playing Mozart
during pregnancy

506
00:28:06,751 --> 00:28:09,083
so the fetus can hear it.

507
00:28:09,154 --> 00:28:11,418
It was supposed to
increase intelligence.

508
00:28:11,489 --> 00:28:13,480
It didn't work. It didn't work.

509
00:28:13,558 --> 00:28:15,788
All it did was
sell a lot of CDs

510
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:18,420
and piss off
a whole lot of fetuses.

511
00:28:21,566 --> 00:28:26,026
The self-esteem movement
revolved around a single notion

512
00:28:26,104 --> 00:28:32,168
- the idea, the single idea
that every child is special.

513
00:28:32,243 --> 00:28:35,110
Boy, they said it over
and over and over,

514
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:37,307
as if to convince themselves.

515
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:40,476
Every child is special.

516
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:45,319
And I kept saying fuck you.

517
00:28:47,292 --> 00:28:53,253
Every child is
clearly not special.

518
00:28:53,331 --> 00:28:55,196
Did you ever look
at one of them?

519
00:28:55,266 --> 00:28:58,895
Did you ever take a good close
look at one of these fucking kids?

520
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:00,938
They're goofy.

521
00:29:01,005 --> 00:29:03,735
They're fucking goofy looking.

522
00:29:03,808 --> 00:29:06,971
They're too small -
they're way too fucking small.

523
00:29:07,045 --> 00:29:09,275
They're mal proportioned. Their
heads don't fit their bodies;

524
00:29:09,347 --> 00:29:10,905
their arms are too
weird and everything.

525
00:29:10,982 --> 00:29:13,815
They can't walk across the
room in a straight line.

526
00:29:13,885 --> 00:29:18,185
And when they talk they talk
like they got a mouthful of shit.

527
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:20,383
They're incomplete.

528
00:29:20,458 --> 00:29:23,291
Incomplete, unfinished work.

529
00:29:23,361 --> 00:29:26,728
I never give credit
for incomplete work.

530
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:30,666
Now, PT Barnum
might think they're special,

531
00:29:30,735 --> 00:29:33,898
but not me. I have standards.

532
00:29:33,972 --> 00:29:37,032
But let's say it's true. Let's grab this.
I'm in a generous mood.

533
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:38,837
Let's grant this proposition.

534
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:44,007
Let's say it's true and somehow
all - every child is special.

535
00:29:44,082 --> 00:29:46,016
What about every adult?

536
00:29:46,084 --> 00:29:48,575
Isn't ever adult special too?

537
00:29:48,653 --> 00:29:53,886
And if not, if not then
at what age do you go

538
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:56,893
from being special

539
00:29:56,961 --> 00:30:00,055
to being not-so-special?

540
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:02,861
And if every adult is special
then it means we're all special,

541
00:30:02,934 --> 00:30:05,960
and the whole idea loses
all of its fucking meaning.

542
00:30:07,105 --> 00:30:09,972
Here's another platitude
they jam down our throat:

543
00:30:10,041 --> 00:30:13,067
children are our future.

544
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:15,612
Children are not our future,

545
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:19,980
and I can prove it
with my usual flawless logic.

546
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:32,025
Children can't be our
future because

547
00:30:32,096 --> 00:30:35,554
by the time the future arrives
they won't be children anymore,

548
00:30:35,633 --> 00:30:38,227
so blow me.

549
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:40,531
Yes.

550
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:45,503
As you may have noticed I always like
to present a carefully reasoned argument.

551
00:30:46,711 --> 00:30:49,771
Raising a child
is not difficult.

552
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:53,648
They try to make it into this
mysterious, difficult task.

553
00:30:53,718 --> 00:30:54,776
Nothing to it.

554
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:56,946
Easiest thing in the world
to raise a kid

555
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:59,319
if you follow the steps.

556
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:00,448
First step,

557
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:04,256
you take the kid and you put it
out on the street corner,

558
00:31:04,329 --> 00:31:06,627
and you leave him there.

559
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:08,928
You come back a week later.

560
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,627
If the kid is still there

561
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:13,296
you've got yourself
a stupid fucking kid.

562
00:31:21,145 --> 00:31:24,911
Then you just proceed
from that point.

563
00:31:24,983 --> 00:31:26,280
It's all bullshit, folks.

564
00:31:26,351 --> 00:31:28,478
It's all bullshit,
and it's bad for you.

565
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:32,682
Now, you wouldn't know it

566
00:31:32,757 --> 00:31:36,318
from some of the things
I've said over the years,

567
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:38,487
but I like people.

568
00:31:42,367 --> 00:31:44,062
I do.

569
00:31:44,135 --> 00:31:48,902
I like people, but I like
them in short bursts.

570
00:31:48,973 --> 00:31:52,807
I don't like people for
extended periods of time.

571
00:31:52,877 --> 00:31:55,277
I'm all right with them
for a little while,

572
00:31:55,346 --> 00:32:00,909
but once you get up past a
minute, minute and a half,

573
00:32:00,985 --> 00:32:02,452
I've got to get the
fuck out of there.

574
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:08,985
And my reason for this, my reason is
for one that you may share possibly.

575
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:13,190
I have a very low tolerance
level for stupid bullshit.

576
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:16,097
That's all. Stupid bullshit.

577
00:32:17,535 --> 00:32:18,695
You know.

578
00:32:21,739 --> 00:32:26,267
And everyone wants to tell
you their stupid bullshit,

579
00:32:26,344 --> 00:32:29,575
and a lot of them don't know when to
stop talking. You ever run into that guy?

580
00:32:29,647 --> 00:32:30,671
Doesn't know when
to stop talking,

581
00:32:30,748 --> 00:32:35,276
just continues running at the
mouth like verbal diarrhea.

582
00:32:35,353 --> 00:32:36,945
Don't know when the
conversation is over.

583
00:32:37,021 --> 00:32:39,819
Stupid, trivial shit you
don't care anything about,

584
00:32:39,891 --> 00:32:43,349
things you're not even
remotely interested in.

585
00:32:43,428 --> 00:32:45,658
"Did I tell you
about my mom and dad?

586
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:50,667
Well, my mom and dad went on vacation
down to Mammoth Cave, Kentucky.

587
00:32:50,735 --> 00:32:55,035
This is about six
years ago, I think.

588
00:32:55,106 --> 00:32:57,370
It seemed like it was
six, about six years ago.

589
00:32:57,442 --> 00:33:01,003
Six or seven - possibly seven.
Could be.

590
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:06,073
Somewhere in there, six seven.
More than six; less than seven.

591
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:08,618
Let's call it six and a half.

592
00:33:08,686 --> 00:33:12,019
So my mom and dad went on
vacation to Mammoth Cave, Kentucky,

593
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:14,115
and my dad
found a big rock.

594
00:33:14,192 --> 00:33:19,027
What he thought was a big rock
turns out it was a dinosaur turd,

595
00:33:19,097 --> 00:33:24,592
a petrified
dinosaur turd, 27 pounder.

596
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:27,035
You know, now that
I think of it,

597
00:33:27,105 --> 00:33:30,233
it might have been
eight years ago.

598
00:33:30,308 --> 00:33:33,175
That would have been
close to Y2K, wouldn't it?

599
00:33:33,244 --> 00:33:35,041
Remember Y2K?

600
00:33:35,113 --> 00:33:36,774
Whatever happened?

601
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:39,783
Everybody's all worried about that.
Nothing ever happened.

602
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:43,412
Ha, ha, ha, big fuss.
Nothing every happened.

603
00:33:43,488 --> 00:33:44,921
You know? God.

604
00:33:44,989 --> 00:33:46,718
That was strange, you know."

605
00:33:47,392 --> 00:33:50,020
"So let's say -
we'll say it's eight years.

606
00:33:50,094 --> 00:33:54,292
It was either eight or five.

607
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:56,356
So my dad gave my
mom this big turd.

608
00:33:56,434 --> 00:33:58,561
He says, 'Here, Mom.
This is a big dinosaur turd.

609
00:33:58,636 --> 00:34:01,127
Put it in your purse
to take that home.'

610
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:04,299
My mom said, 'Dad, I don't
think this is a dinosaur turd.

611
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:07,606
This thing is still warm.

612
00:34:07,678 --> 00:34:11,045
Whoever dropped this thing is
still walking around in here,

613
00:34:11,115 --> 00:34:13,879
and we'd better get the
fuck out of this cave.'

614
00:34:18,189 --> 00:34:21,022
Nine years ago.

615
00:34:21,092 --> 00:34:22,252
Nine.

616
00:34:22,326 --> 00:34:26,387
I know it was nine because my wife
was pregnant with our first boy,

617
00:34:26,464 --> 00:34:30,161
Mach Moody Benel Sayid
Ben Salem,

618
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:32,327
and he's ten now.

619
00:34:36,474 --> 00:34:39,409
Or is he? He's 11.
Maybe he's 11.

620
00:34:39,477 --> 00:34:42,412
He's either 11 or 5."

621
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,210
And while all of this is going on
you're searching through your mind

622
00:34:45,283 --> 00:34:48,047
for something graceful and
diplomatic you can say

623
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:50,053
to bring the conversation
to a close,

624
00:34:50,121 --> 00:34:52,646
and all I can ever come up with
is shut the fuck up.

625
00:34:52,723 --> 00:34:55,351
Shut the fuck up.
Shut the fuck up.

626
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:57,621
Shut the fuck up.

627
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:09,535
But you can't say that.
Good manners don't permit it.

628
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:13,509
You have to find another way,
and I go to body language.

629
00:35:13,578 --> 00:35:17,173
I try to use my body language to
show that the conversation is over.

630
00:35:17,248 --> 00:35:21,412
I find myself leaning
at a 45-degree angle

631
00:35:21,486 --> 00:35:25,183
trying to indicate the direction
that I'd like to go

632
00:35:25,256 --> 00:35:28,623
if this person
would just shut the fuck up.

633
00:35:28,693 --> 00:35:30,593
And then I might even
give him a verbal cue.

634
00:35:30,661 --> 00:35:32,686
"Surgery. Surgery.

635
00:35:32,763 --> 00:35:34,993
I'm late for surgery.

636
00:35:35,066 --> 00:35:39,059
I'm having my ears sewn shut."

637
00:35:40,938 --> 00:35:42,098
You know.

638
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:44,832
Yeah.

639
00:35:44,909 --> 00:35:46,376
Same people on the phone.

640
00:35:46,444 --> 00:35:48,708
Same people on the phone -
don't know when to hang up.

641
00:35:48,779 --> 00:35:50,576
Don't know when the
conversation is over.

642
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:52,138
Dumb, trivial shit.

643
00:35:52,216 --> 00:35:53,774
Dumb questions.

644
00:35:53,851 --> 00:35:58,049
"So what are you guys gonna
do five summers from now?

645
00:35:58,122 --> 00:36:00,784
We haven't made any plans.
Marge wants to go to the beach.

646
00:36:00,858 --> 00:36:02,325
The kids kind of
like it at the lake,

647
00:36:02,393 --> 00:36:04,088
and I want to go
to the mountains.

648
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:08,599
Grandma wants to visit her
sister in Frog Balls, Arkansas.

649
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:10,463
How about you, have
you made any plans?

650
00:36:10,535 --> 00:36:12,469
It's never too
early to make plans.

651
00:36:12,537 --> 00:36:16,496
We're going to Norway in 2025.

652
00:36:16,574 --> 00:36:18,760
Did you know up until the 1950's,

653
00:36:18,761 --> 00:36:21,807
Norway's economy was
based largely on fishing,

654
00:36:21,879 --> 00:36:23,972
but now, thanks to improved
drilling techniques

655
00:36:24,048 --> 00:36:25,606
and the expansion
of the global economy."

656
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:30,916
Once again, searching through your
mind for something gentle you can say.

657
00:36:30,988 --> 00:36:33,752
"Blow it out your ass,"
comes to mind.

658
00:36:33,824 --> 00:36:36,816
Or shut your fucking pie-hole.

659
00:36:36,894 --> 00:36:41,661
Or if your friend prefers cake,
shut your fucking cake-hole.

660
00:36:41,732 --> 00:36:44,030
But you can't say these things,

661
00:36:44,101 --> 00:36:47,036
and you can't use body language
on the phone.

662
00:36:47,104 --> 00:36:49,971
Well, you could always
amuse yourself, you know.

663
00:36:56,914 --> 00:36:59,763
Or if it's your mother you
show your mother respect;

664
00:36:59,764 --> 00:37:01,214
you put her on speakerphone.

665
00:37:11,095 --> 00:37:12,960
But that doesn't move
the conversation along.

666
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:14,554
You have to find another trick.

667
00:37:14,632 --> 00:37:17,100
And I go to tone of voice.

668
00:37:17,168 --> 00:37:20,535
Did you ever use your tone of voice to
try to talk them into a soft landing?

669
00:37:20,605 --> 00:37:22,869
You try to coax the
person toward the end.

670
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:24,271
"Right. Good.

671
00:37:24,342 --> 00:37:25,900
Okay. Good.

672
00:37:25,977 --> 00:37:26,966
All right then.

673
00:37:27,044 --> 00:37:28,636
Good. Great. Okay.

674
00:37:28,713 --> 00:37:29,771
Good. Okay.

675
00:37:29,847 --> 00:37:30,432
All right.

676
00:37:30,433 --> 00:37:33,180
"Oh, fuck, there he goes again.
That cocksucker.

677
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:39,319
"You remember my neighbor with the
burns on 90 percent of her body?

678
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:43,121
Well, she burned the
other 10 percent now.

679
00:37:43,194 --> 00:37:46,721
She was lighting a fart,
and her bush caught fire."

680
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:58,007
"Listen, Reverend."

681
00:38:01,412 --> 00:38:03,880
"Reverend, I hate to be rude,

682
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:08,078
but I just took a three
and a half hour shit,

683
00:38:08,152 --> 00:38:11,952
and I'm bleeding
from the asshole.

684
00:38:12,023 --> 00:38:15,720
Well, I don't have
any mercurochrome.

685
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:19,229
Yes. Yeah, I'll put a Snoopy
band-aid on it. Thank you.

686
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:22,232
You do that for me. Yes,
say a prayer for my asshole.

687
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,858
Thank you very much."

688
00:38:24,268 --> 00:38:26,099
You have to resort
to these tactics

689
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:30,106
because many people do not
understand what a phone call should be

690
00:38:30,174 --> 00:38:31,698
or what a phone call is.

691
00:38:31,776 --> 00:38:34,438
Ideally, a phone call is

692
00:38:34,512 --> 00:38:38,346
the brief exchange of a few
vital pieces of information.

693
00:38:38,416 --> 00:38:39,940
This is a phone call.

694
00:38:40,017 --> 00:38:44,249
"Hey, Steve, what time's the
circle jerk start tonight?

695
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:46,654
Ten o'clock. Okay. Listen, I'm
going to be a little bit late.

696
00:38:46,724 --> 00:38:48,954
You'll have to start without me.

697
00:38:49,026 --> 00:38:50,152
Oh, don't worry. I'll catch up.

698
00:38:50,227 --> 00:38:54,220
I'm eating a whole bunch of
oysters and watching a horny movie.

699
00:38:54,298 --> 00:38:58,029
It's called
<i>Tarzan Fucks a Zebra.</i>

700
00:38:58,102 --> 00:38:59,865
Russell Crowe.

701
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:08,309
Well, it's kind of a fantasy. Right now
Renee Zellweger is blowing a unicorn."

702
00:39:08,379 --> 00:39:10,711
That's a phone call.

703
00:39:10,781 --> 00:39:13,079
It should not be a
two and a half hour harangue

704
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:17,644
of your third cousin describing
her mailman's liposuction.

705
00:39:17,722 --> 00:39:20,691
God, people are fucking boring.

706
00:39:20,758 --> 00:39:23,659
People are just fucking boring.

707
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:26,329
You know what would be
great for a guy like me?

708
00:39:26,397 --> 00:39:29,491
Just to be in a coma.

709
00:39:29,567 --> 00:39:30,556
Huh?

710
00:39:30,634 --> 00:39:32,499
Wouldn't that be great?
Nothing to do all day.

711
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:35,869
You just crap out and breathe
through a fucking tube.

712
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:38,670
They feed you through a tube.
There's nothing to do.

713
00:39:38,743 --> 00:39:42,110
Whoa, you talk about being a
couch potato, that's it man.

714
00:39:42,179 --> 00:39:43,942
No phone calls coming in.

715
00:39:44,014 --> 00:39:46,778
Nobody dropping by unexpectedly.

716
00:39:46,851 --> 00:39:50,378
And if they do drop by you're
completely unaware of it

717
00:39:50,454 --> 00:39:52,354
because you're in
a fucking coma,

718
00:39:52,423 --> 00:39:54,687
and you're practically
clinically dead.

719
00:39:54,759 --> 00:39:57,660
And you don't have to
listen to their stupid shit.

720
00:39:57,728 --> 00:40:01,425
Their stupid shit like about
their new ride-around lawnmower

721
00:40:01,499 --> 00:40:06,630
with the two-tone horn and the GPS
in case they get lost on the lawn.

722
00:40:09,707 --> 00:40:14,303
And their boss and their job
and their car and their kids.

723
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:18,575
Jesus fucking Christ,

724
00:40:18,649 --> 00:40:19,809
their kids.

725
00:40:19,884 --> 00:40:22,648
Folks, folks, nothing worse.

726
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:26,053
Nothing worse
than to be stuck somewhere

727
00:40:26,123 --> 00:40:28,683
with some married asshole

728
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:32,286
and have to listen to him
tell you about his fucking kids.

729
00:40:32,363 --> 00:40:34,831
Let me tell you
something, folks.

730
00:40:34,899 --> 00:40:37,925
Nobody cares about
your children, okay?

731
00:40:38,002 --> 00:40:40,232
No. We don't care.

732
00:40:40,304 --> 00:40:42,067
We don't care.

733
00:40:46,177 --> 00:40:50,079
Nobody cares about your children.
I speak for everyone.

734
00:40:50,147 --> 00:40:52,581
I've been appointed by the rest
of the group to inform you

735
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:55,016
we don't care
about your children.

736
00:40:55,085 --> 00:40:58,816
That's why they're your children

737
00:40:58,889 --> 00:41:02,188
so you can care about them,
and we don't have to bother.

738
00:41:02,259 --> 00:41:03,749
But they tell you anyway.

739
00:41:03,828 --> 00:41:06,695
"Todd is in the
seventh grade now.

740
00:41:06,764 --> 00:41:11,064
He's in the cheese club.

741
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:18,473
Jaselle is 5 and already
she's had nine periods.

742
00:41:18,542 --> 00:41:21,673
Johan is 11,
and he pretty much sits

743
00:41:21,674 --> 00:41:25,311
around the house hallucinating all the time."

744
00:41:26,851 --> 00:41:29,149
Then they want to
show you the pictures.

745
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:30,881
Here's another ordeal,

746
00:41:30,955 --> 00:41:35,915
the pictures of these
little gargoyles

747
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:41,431
that they have
loosed from their loins.

748
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:44,024
A lot of these
professional mommies,

749
00:41:44,101 --> 00:41:46,934
boy, they think there's nothing
better than having a baby.

750
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:48,972
Oh, they think it's the
biggest thing in the world

751
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:51,940
like it's a big event
having a baby.

752
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:55,877
I call it pumping out a unit.

753
00:41:55,946 --> 00:41:57,777
That's all they're doing.

754
00:41:57,848 --> 00:42:00,248
That's all they're doing.
Pumping out a fucking unit.

755
00:42:00,317 --> 00:42:01,614
Ba-boom.

756
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,750
Ba-boom.

757
00:42:04,822 --> 00:42:07,985
Like some of them like
assembly lines like a factory.

758
00:42:08,058 --> 00:42:08,956
Ba-ba-boom.

759
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:09,993
Every fucking year,

760
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:11,391
ba-ba-boom.

761
00:42:11,462 --> 00:42:12,622
"Hey, Jeff, want a kid?"

762
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:14,960
Ba-ba-boom.

763
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:15,726
"How about twins?"

764
00:42:15,799 --> 00:42:18,495
Ba-ba-boom, ba-ba-boom.

765
00:42:18,569 --> 00:42:21,595
Polluting the earth.

766
00:42:21,672 --> 00:42:25,574
Polluting the earth
with these creatures

767
00:42:25,643 --> 00:42:28,043
who have no future.

768
00:42:28,112 --> 00:42:30,171
They have no future.

769
00:42:30,247 --> 00:42:34,308
Have you pictured what this planet
is going to be like in 40 to 50 years?

770
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:39,584
It's going to be
a big smoking ball of shit,

771
00:42:39,657 --> 00:42:45,220
a big, smoking, flaming,
stinking ball of gaseous shit.

772
00:42:45,296 --> 00:42:46,854
That's what's gonna happen.

773
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:49,624
That's what's gonna happen.

774
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:52,032
It's irresponsible to
have more than one child.

775
00:42:52,102 --> 00:42:53,126
Have one.

776
00:42:53,203 --> 00:42:56,764
Have one child, replacement
value for yourself, that's all.

777
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:59,934
Don't even replace your husband.

778
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:01,705
Don't replace your husband.

779
00:43:01,779 --> 00:43:02,677
No.

780
00:43:05,015 --> 00:43:07,449
He's done enough
fucking damage as it is.

781
00:43:08,986 --> 00:43:11,477
But they want to show
you the pictures.

782
00:43:11,555 --> 00:43:13,614
Sometimes they warn you,
you know. That's good.

783
00:43:13,691 --> 00:43:15,682
They say, "Hey, you want to
see some pictures of my kid?"

784
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:17,727
No,

785
00:43:17,795 --> 00:43:20,593
just describe them to me.

786
00:43:20,664 --> 00:43:24,623
But they show you, and there are two
ways you can handle it, I have found.

787
00:43:24,702 --> 00:43:27,034
Two ways to handle the pictures.

788
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:28,799
The first is the easy way.

789
00:43:28,872 --> 00:43:30,863
You just kind of take
it all in stride,

790
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:33,068
you matter-of-factly go
along with the game.

791
00:43:33,143 --> 00:43:36,044
"Oh, uh-huh, boy.

792
00:43:36,113 --> 00:43:37,671
Girl. Yeah.

793
00:43:37,748 --> 00:43:39,613
Older boy.

794
00:43:39,683 --> 00:43:41,947
Older girl. Good. Four.

795
00:43:42,019 --> 00:43:46,217
Listen, I have to go wash my
crotch. I'll see you later."

796
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:48,315
Then you get the
fuck out of there.

797
00:43:49,493 --> 00:43:51,791
Or you can do what I do -

798
00:43:51,862 --> 00:43:57,664
you can do what I do, be a
little honest about what you see.

799
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:01,367
Take a chance.

800
00:44:01,438 --> 00:44:03,372
Tell the truth.

801
00:44:08,712 --> 00:44:11,510
"Look at the fucking
head on that kid."

802
00:44:15,619 --> 00:44:18,417
"Geez, where did he
get a fucking head like that?

803
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:20,980
That thing is huge.

804
00:44:21,058 --> 00:44:24,858
Have you put him on YouTube yet?

805
00:44:24,928 --> 00:44:27,556
Boy, you get a lot of hits
with a head like that.

806
00:44:27,631 --> 00:44:30,623
Or put him on eBay. You might
make a little money, you know.

807
00:44:30,701 --> 00:44:35,331
I'm sure some European circus would
snap his ass up in a fucking minute, boy.

808
00:44:35,406 --> 00:44:39,308
Goddamn that thing is unusual.

809
00:44:39,376 --> 00:44:42,402
Listen, maybe he'll grow into it.
You never know with kids, huh.

810
00:44:42,479 --> 00:44:44,606
Hey, let me ask you
a practical question.

811
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:48,982
Where do you find hats
for a kid like that?"

812
00:44:49,053 --> 00:44:51,954
Tell the truth.
Don't be bullshitting people.

813
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:55,423
Don't be bullshitting. There's
enough bullshit as it is, folks.

814
00:44:55,492 --> 00:44:56,857
There's plenty of bullshit.

815
00:44:56,927 --> 00:45:00,488
Then they want to show you the
pictures of the little girl

816
00:45:00,564 --> 00:45:02,896
whose second teeth
are coming in,

817
00:45:02,966 --> 00:45:05,161
and they think it's cute.

818
00:45:05,235 --> 00:45:06,964
It's not.

819
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:11,371
It's fucking horrifying.

820
00:45:11,442 --> 00:45:13,933
Did you ever look at the teeth
coming in on some of these kids?

821
00:45:14,011 --> 00:45:17,276
Did you ever take a good, close
look at actually in the mouth?

822
00:45:17,347 --> 00:45:19,474
Take a look and see different -
damn, sometimes they got

823
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:22,781
two, three rows of fucking
teeth coming in there.

824
00:45:22,853 --> 00:45:23,877
All odd angles.

825
00:45:23,954 --> 00:45:27,151
There's one under the tongue.
That's unusual. Look at that.

826
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:30,455
A sublingual tooth.
What do you know.

827
00:45:30,527 --> 00:45:33,087
Once again, tell the truth.

828
00:45:33,163 --> 00:45:36,530
"You better start saving
your money right now, pal.

829
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:40,127
It's gonna cost you a
fucking fortune to fix that.

830
00:45:40,204 --> 00:45:45,141
You're gonna need an international
team of orthodontists around the clock

831
00:45:45,209 --> 00:45:46,141
just to make a dent.

832
00:45:46,210 --> 00:45:47,628
You might want to call FEMA.

833
00:45:47,629 --> 00:45:49,907
That looks like a real
fucking problem to me.

834
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:51,072
Look at that.

835
00:45:51,148 --> 00:45:52,649
You have the number
to the National Guard?

836
00:45:52,650 --> 00:45:53,207
Give them a ring.

837
00:45:53,283 --> 00:45:54,250
That's good.

838
00:45:54,318 --> 00:45:56,960
Listen, why don't you
just have them all pulled

839
00:45:56,961 --> 00:45:59,051
and let her start
over again, you know?

840
00:45:59,123 --> 00:46:01,683
Or take a picture of her
with her mouth closed.

841
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:04,250
That would save you a lot of
heartache in the long run.

842
00:46:04,328 --> 00:46:06,523
Listen, you're not Catholic
by any chance, are you?

843
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:07,529
Well, the reason I ask is

844
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:10,931
you might want to take her to Lewards
and pray for a miracle over there."

845
00:46:12,035 --> 00:46:15,198
Tell the truth.
Don't be bullshitting people.

846
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:18,070
Like I say, there's
enough bullshit as it is.

847
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:20,738
There's enough
bullshit as it is.

848
00:46:20,811 --> 00:46:24,042
In fact, there's just
enough, did you know that?

849
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:29,609
There's just enough bullshit to
hold things together in this country.

850
00:46:29,686 --> 00:46:34,714
Bullshit is the glue that
binds us as a nation.

851
00:46:34,792 --> 00:46:38,558
Where would we be without
our safe, familiar,

852
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:40,927
American bullshit.

853
00:46:40,998 --> 00:46:42,625
Land of the free.
Home of the brave.

854
00:46:42,699 --> 00:46:44,132
The American dream.

855
00:46:44,201 --> 00:46:46,032
All men are equal.
Justice is blind.

856
00:46:46,103 --> 00:46:47,434
The press is free.

857
00:46:47,504 --> 00:46:49,495
Your vote counts.

858
00:46:51,375 --> 00:46:52,501
Business is honest.

859
00:46:52,576 --> 00:46:54,544
The good guys win.

860
00:46:54,611 --> 00:46:57,603
The police are on your side.

861
00:46:57,681 --> 00:46:59,478
God is watching you.

862
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:03,680
Your standard of living
will never decline.

863
00:47:03,754 --> 00:47:06,723
And everything is
gonna be just fine.

864
00:47:06,790 --> 00:47:09,350
The official national
bullshit story.

865
00:47:09,426 --> 00:47:11,951
I call it the
American okie-doke.

866
00:47:12,462 --> 00:47:16,956
Every one, every one of those items is
provably untrue at one level or another,

867
00:47:17,034 --> 00:47:18,058
but we believe them

868
00:47:18,135 --> 00:47:20,569
because they're pounded into our
heads from the time we're children.

869
00:47:20,637 --> 00:47:22,195
That's what they do
with that kind of thing,

870
00:47:22,272 --> 00:47:23,395
pound it into the heads of kids

871
00:47:23,396 --> 00:47:25,207
because they know that
children are much too young

872
00:47:25,275 --> 00:47:27,300
to be able to
muster an intellectual defense

873
00:47:27,377 --> 00:47:29,311
against a sophisticated
idea like that.

874
00:47:29,379 --> 00:47:31,108
And they know that
up to a certain age

875
00:47:31,181 --> 00:47:33,877
children believe everything
their parents tell them,

876
00:47:33,951 --> 00:47:36,442
and as a result, they never
learn to question things.

877
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:38,420
Nobody questions things
in this country anymore.

878
00:47:38,488 --> 00:47:40,888
Nobody questions anything.
Everybody is too fat and happy.

879
00:47:40,958 --> 00:47:46,260
Everybody has got a cell phone that'll
make pancakes and rub their balls now.

880
00:47:46,330 --> 00:47:48,730
Way too fucking prosperous
for our own good,

881
00:47:48,799 --> 00:47:50,096
way too fucking prosperous.

882
00:47:50,167 --> 00:47:53,568
Americans have been bought off
in silence by toys and gizmos,

883
00:47:53,637 --> 00:47:55,298
and no one learns
to question things.

884
00:47:55,372 --> 00:47:57,533
Do you remember - Okay.

885
00:48:00,344 --> 00:48:03,006
Now, okay.

886
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:04,513
You remember Barbara Bush?

887
00:48:04,581 --> 00:48:07,277
I call her the silver douche bag.
You remember her?

888
00:48:10,153 --> 00:48:13,418
Barbara Bush. She is the mother
of Governor George Bush.

889
00:48:13,490 --> 00:48:16,550
I call him Governor Bush because
that's the only elected office

890
00:48:16,627 --> 00:48:19,187
he ever held legally
in our country, okay.

891
00:48:19,263 --> 00:48:21,094
George Bush, Governor Bush.

892
00:48:27,504 --> 00:48:29,529
I don't care where
they hang his portrait.

893
00:48:29,606 --> 00:48:34,100
I don't care how big his library is.
He'll always be Governor Bush.

894
00:48:34,177 --> 00:48:39,012
I don't even capitalize his
name when I type it anymore.

895
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:40,913
So she's the mother
of Governor George Bush.

896
00:48:40,984 --> 00:48:44,215
She's also the wife of
his father, George H. W. Bush

897
00:48:44,288 --> 00:48:47,280
who did become president in the
normal, legal, traditional manner.

898
00:48:47,357 --> 00:48:51,259
And when he did, she came along
for the ride as first lady,

899
00:48:51,328 --> 00:48:53,057
and that's been the
tradition up 'til now.

900
00:48:53,130 --> 00:48:54,493
A man has been elected and

901
00:48:54,494 --> 00:48:57,430
the woman has come along for
the ride as the first lady.

902
00:48:57,501 --> 00:49:00,129
And usually, as in
American life in general,

903
00:49:00,203 --> 00:49:03,263
the woman is condescended to,
patronized,

904
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:05,604
given something to
do to keep her busy.

905
00:49:05,676 --> 00:49:08,839
A lot of times they give her a charity
or a cause, something she can champion.

906
00:49:08,912 --> 00:49:12,575
Betty Ford was told to drink.
Remember that?

907
00:49:12,649 --> 00:49:16,141
Yeah, that was
Betty Ford's assignment.

908
00:49:16,219 --> 00:49:20,918
"Betty, you get drunk and get totally falling
down, fucked-up, shit-faced drunk, okay?

909
00:49:20,991 --> 00:49:24,586
You just get fucked up drunk,
and we'll hose you down, baby.

910
00:49:24,661 --> 00:49:25,855
We'll hose you down.

911
00:49:25,929 --> 00:49:27,863
We'll put you in a
facility, you'll get sober,

912
00:49:27,931 --> 00:49:29,364
and then we'll put your
name on the facility.

913
00:49:29,433 --> 00:49:32,960
Liza Minnelli can get sober, and
everything is going to be okay."

914
00:49:33,036 --> 00:49:34,901
That was her assignment.

915
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:37,702
Barbara Bush's assignment was

916
00:49:37,774 --> 00:49:39,742
getting children to read.

917
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:40,640
Remember that?

918
00:49:40,711 --> 00:49:42,269
Getting children to read.

919
00:49:42,346 --> 00:49:46,874
They figured she had
so much success with George

920
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:02,093
that she would be a natural
to get children to read,

921
00:50:02,165 --> 00:50:03,962
which misses the
point completely.

922
00:50:04,034 --> 00:50:05,797
Not important to get
children to read.

923
00:50:05,869 --> 00:50:07,200
Children who want to
read are gonna read.

924
00:50:07,270 --> 00:50:09,101
Kids who want to learn to
read are gonna learn to read.

925
00:50:09,172 --> 00:50:12,198
Much more important to teach
children to question what they read.

926
00:50:12,275 --> 00:50:14,470
Children should be taught to
question everything.

927
00:50:14,544 --> 00:50:18,742
To question everything they
read, everything they hear.

928
00:50:18,815 --> 00:50:20,840
Children should be taught
to question authority.

929
00:50:20,917 --> 00:50:24,284
Parents never teach their children
to question authority because

930
00:50:24,354 --> 00:50:26,322
parents are authority
figures themselves,

931
00:50:26,390 --> 00:50:29,382
and they don't want to undermine their
own bullshit inside the household.

932
00:50:29,459 --> 00:50:31,222
So they stroke the kid
and the kid strokes them,

933
00:50:31,294 --> 00:50:33,455
and they all stroke each other,
all grow up all fucked up,

934
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:35,998
and they come to
shows like this.

935
00:50:44,174 --> 00:50:48,440
Kids have to be warned that there's
bullshit coming down the road.

936
00:50:48,512 --> 00:50:49,945
That's the biggest thing
you can do for a kid.

937
00:50:50,013 --> 00:50:51,878
Tell them what life in
this country is about.

938
00:50:51,948 --> 00:50:55,975
It's about a whole lot of bullshit
that needs to be detected and avoided.

939
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:57,987
That's the best thing you can do.
No one told me.

940
00:50:58,055 --> 00:50:59,454
No one told me a
thing like that.

941
00:50:59,523 --> 00:51:00,888
I was never warned
about any of this.

942
00:51:00,957 --> 00:51:02,720
I had to find all of
it out for myself.

943
00:51:02,793 --> 00:51:04,852
And there are still,
as with you probably,

944
00:51:04,928 --> 00:51:09,126
a lot of things that you're expected
to believe and accept in America

945
00:51:09,199 --> 00:51:11,724
that I personally
have a problem with,

946
00:51:11,802 --> 00:51:13,269
and I question a
lot of these things.

947
00:51:13,336 --> 00:51:14,268
I'll give you an example.

948
00:51:14,337 --> 00:51:17,795
I saw a slogan on a guy's car that
said "Proud to be an American."

949
00:51:17,874 --> 00:51:20,399
And I thought, well, what
the fuck does that mean?

950
00:51:20,477 --> 00:51:21,739
Proud to be an American.

951
00:51:21,812 --> 00:51:24,076
You see, I've never
understood national pride.

952
00:51:24,147 --> 00:51:26,138
I've never understood
ethnic pride.

953
00:51:26,216 --> 00:51:27,222
Because I'm Irish,

954
00:51:27,223 --> 00:51:31,244
and all four of my grandparents were
born in Ireland, so I'm fully Irish.

955
00:51:31,321 --> 00:51:34,085
And when I was a kid I would go
to the St. Patrick's Day parade,

956
00:51:34,157 --> 00:51:37,558
and I noticed they sold a button
that said "Proud to be Irish."

957
00:51:37,627 --> 00:51:39,788
And I could never understand
that because I knew

958
00:51:39,863 --> 00:51:44,061
that on Columbus Day they sold a different
button that said "Proud to be Italian."

959
00:51:44,134 --> 00:51:46,432
Then came black pride
and Puerto Rican pride.

960
00:51:46,503 --> 00:51:49,370
And I could never understand
ethnic or national pride

961
00:51:49,439 --> 00:51:51,737
because to me pride
should be reserved

962
00:51:51,808 --> 00:51:55,141
for something you achieve
or attain on your own,

963
00:51:55,212 --> 00:51:58,010
not something that happens
by accident of birth.

964
00:51:58,081 --> 00:51:59,673
Being Irish -

965
00:52:05,689 --> 00:52:09,352
Being Irish isn't a skill.

966
00:52:09,426 --> 00:52:12,452
It's a fucking genetic accident.

967
00:52:12,529 --> 00:52:15,430
You wouldn't say
"I'm proud to be 5'11".

968
00:52:15,499 --> 00:52:19,959
I'm proud to have a
predisposition for colon cancer.

969
00:52:20,036 --> 00:52:21,867
So why the fuck would you be
proud to be Irish

970
00:52:21,938 --> 00:52:24,031
or proud to be Italian
or American or anything?

971
00:52:24,107 --> 00:52:25,699
Hey, if you're happy
with it, that's fine.

972
00:52:25,775 --> 00:52:28,608
Do that. Put that on your car.
"Happy to be an American."

973
00:52:28,678 --> 00:52:31,374
Be happy. Don't be proud.
Too much pride as it is.

974
00:52:31,448 --> 00:52:33,439
Pride goeth before a fall.

975
00:52:33,517 --> 00:52:35,144
Never forget Proverbs, okay.

976
00:52:35,385 --> 00:52:38,013
Now, here's another slogan -

977
00:52:38,088 --> 00:52:40,113
here's another slogan
you run into all the time.

978
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:41,748
"God bless America."

979
00:52:41,825 --> 00:52:46,057
Once again, respectfully, I say to
myself, "What the fuck does that mean?"

980
00:52:46,129 --> 00:52:49,690
God bless America.
Is that a request?

981
00:52:49,766 --> 00:52:52,633
Is that a demand?
Is that a suggestion?

982
00:52:52,702 --> 00:52:55,000
Politicians say it
at the end of every speech

983
00:52:55,071 --> 00:52:59,337
as if it were some sort of verbal
tick that they can't get rid of.

984
00:52:59,409 --> 00:53:00,876
"God bless you and
God bless America.

985
00:53:00,944 --> 00:53:02,673
God bless you and
God bless America."

986
00:53:02,746 --> 00:53:04,738
I guess they figure
if they leave it out

987
00:53:04,739 --> 00:53:06,876
someone is gonna think
they're bad Americans.

988
00:53:06,950 --> 00:53:09,145
Let me tell you a little
secret about God, folks.

989
00:53:09,219 --> 00:53:12,655
God doesn't give a
flying fuck about America, okay.

990
00:53:12,722 --> 00:53:13,689
He doesn't care.

991
00:53:13,757 --> 00:53:15,019
He never cared
about this country.

992
00:53:15,091 --> 00:53:17,184
He never has. He never will.

993
00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:18,852
He doesn't care
about this country

994
00:53:18,929 --> 00:53:21,454
any more than
he cares about Mongolia,

995
00:53:21,531 --> 00:53:23,055
Transylvania, Pittsburgh,

996
00:53:23,133 --> 00:53:25,226
the Suez Canal
or the North Pole.

997
00:53:25,302 --> 00:53:27,497
He simply doesn't care, okay.

998
00:53:27,571 --> 00:53:29,061
He doesn't care.

999
00:53:29,139 --> 00:53:31,073
Listen, good.

1000
00:53:31,141 --> 00:53:33,109
There are 200 countries
in the world now.

1001
00:53:33,176 --> 00:53:34,961
Do these people honestly think that

1002
00:53:34,962 --> 00:53:37,408
God is sitting around
picking out his favorites?

1003
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:40,813
Why would he do that? Why would
God have a favorite country?

1004
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:43,785
And why would it be America
out of all the countries?

1005
00:53:43,853 --> 00:53:45,753
Because we have the most money?

1006
00:53:45,822 --> 00:53:47,983
Because he likes
our National Anthem?

1007
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:54,054
Maybe it's because he heard we have 18
delicious flavors of classic Rice-A-Roni.

1008
00:53:55,398 --> 00:53:58,196
It's delusional thinking.
It's delusional thinking,

1009
00:53:58,268 --> 00:54:01,237
and Americans are not alone
with these sort of delusions.

1010
00:54:01,304 --> 00:54:04,569
Military cemeteries around
the world are packed

1011
00:54:04,641 --> 00:54:07,735
with brainwashed, dead soldiers

1012
00:54:07,811 --> 00:54:10,507
who were convinced
God was on their side.

1013
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:12,445
America prays for God
to destroy our enemies.

1014
00:54:12,515 --> 00:54:14,449
Our enemies pray for
God to destroy us.

1015
00:54:14,517 --> 00:54:17,452
Somebody is gonna
be disappointed.

1016
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:19,988
Somebody is wasting
their fucking time.

1017
00:54:20,056 --> 00:54:23,287
Could it be everyone?

1018
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:24,657
Now,

1019
00:54:33,169 --> 00:54:35,262
if people want to say God bless America
that's their business.

1020
00:54:35,338 --> 00:54:36,896
I don't care. But here's what
I don't understand.

1021
00:54:36,973 --> 00:54:40,204
If they say God bless America,
presumably they believe in God,

1022
00:54:40,277 --> 00:54:43,246
and if they do, they must have
heard God loved everyone.

1023
00:54:43,313 --> 00:54:44,051
That's what he said.

1024
00:54:44,052 --> 00:54:45,713
He loved everyone,
and he loved them equally.

1025
00:54:45,782 --> 00:54:47,385
So why would these people ask God

1026
00:54:47,386 --> 00:54:49,912
to do something that went
against his own teachings?

1027
00:54:49,986 --> 00:54:52,079
You know what these God bless
America people ought to do?

1028
00:54:52,155 --> 00:54:55,318
They ought to check with that
Jesus fellow they're so crazy about.

1029
00:54:55,392 --> 00:54:57,223
They're always talking
about what would Jesus do,

1030
00:54:57,294 --> 00:54:58,454
what would Jesus do.

1031
00:54:58,528 --> 00:54:59,893
They don't want to
know so they can do it.

1032
00:54:59,963 --> 00:55:02,431
They just want to know so they
could tell other people to do it.

1033
00:55:02,499 --> 00:55:05,764
Well, I'll tell you what
Jesus would have done.

1034
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:10,303
I'll tell you what
Jesus would have done.

1035
00:55:10,373 --> 00:55:12,500
He would have got up on the top of
the Empire State Building and said,

1036
00:55:12,575 --> 00:55:16,011
"God bless everyone around the world,
forever and ever, until the end of time."

1037
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:17,307
That's what Jesus
would have done,

1038
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:18,870
and that's what these
people should do,

1039
00:55:18,948 --> 00:55:22,509
or else they should admit that
God bless America is really just

1040
00:55:22,585 --> 00:55:26,077
some sort of an empty slogan
with no real meaning

1041
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:29,819
except for something vague
like good luck.

1042
00:55:29,893 --> 00:55:32,623
Good luck, America.
You're on your own.

1043
00:55:32,696 --> 00:55:34,789
Which is a little bit
closer to the truth.

1044
00:55:35,365 --> 00:55:38,314
Here's a civic custom
that I don't understand.

1045
00:55:38,315 --> 00:55:39,631
Maybe you can help me.

1046
00:55:39,703 --> 00:55:42,467
Taking off your hat
when a flag passes by

1047
00:55:42,539 --> 00:55:46,202
or when some jack-off at the ballpark
starts singing the National Anthem.

1048
00:55:46,276 --> 00:55:47,743
They tell you to
take off the hat.

1049
00:55:47,811 --> 00:55:51,144
What the fuck does a hat have
to do with being patriotic?

1050
00:55:51,214 --> 00:55:55,412
What possible relationship
exists between the uncovered head

1051
00:55:55,485 --> 00:55:57,885
and a feeling that
ought to live in your heart?

1052
00:55:57,954 --> 00:56:00,149
Suppose you have a red,
white and blue hat.

1053
00:56:00,223 --> 00:56:02,316
Suppose you have a hat
made out of a flag.

1054
00:56:02,392 --> 00:56:04,292
Why would you take it
off to honor the flag?

1055
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:06,261
Wouldn't you leave it on

1056
00:56:06,329 --> 00:56:08,854
and point it toward the flag?

1057
00:56:14,537 --> 00:56:17,199
And what's so bad about hats
that you have to take them off?

1058
00:56:17,273 --> 00:56:20,674
Why not take off your pants

1059
00:56:20,744 --> 00:56:22,837
or your shoes? They tell you
that at the airport.

1060
00:56:22,912 --> 00:56:25,142
They say take off your shoes.

1061
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:26,876
They tell you it's
national security,

1062
00:56:26,950 --> 00:56:29,976
so taking off your shoes
could be patriotic too.

1063
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:33,386
I started to question all of this
stupid hat shit when I was a kid.

1064
00:56:33,456 --> 00:56:35,651
When I was a kid
I was a Catholic,

1065
00:56:35,725 --> 00:56:39,058
at least until I reached
the age of reason, okay.

1066
00:56:39,129 --> 00:56:46,558
So I was a Catholic for about two, two
and a half years, something like that.

1067
00:56:46,636 --> 00:56:49,901
And during that time one of
the things they told us was

1068
00:56:49,973 --> 00:56:52,237
that if a boy or a man
went into a church,

1069
00:56:52,308 --> 00:56:56,210
he had to remove his hat in order
to honor the presence of God.

1070
00:56:56,279 --> 00:56:59,612
But they had already told
me that God was everywhere.

1071
00:56:59,682 --> 00:57:02,515
So I used to wonder,
well, if God is everywhere,

1072
00:57:02,585 --> 00:57:05,452
why would you even own a hat?

1073
00:57:05,522 --> 00:57:10,118
Why not show your respect,
don't even buy a fucking hat.

1074
00:57:10,193 --> 00:57:15,358
And just to confuse things further they
told the women exactly the opposite.

1075
00:57:15,432 --> 00:57:19,732
Catholic women and girls had to cover
their heads when they went into church.

1076
00:57:19,803 --> 00:57:21,123
Same as in certain temples.

1077
00:57:21,124 --> 00:57:23,762
Jewish men have to cover
their heads in those temples.

1078
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:26,866
In those same temples Jewish women
not allowed to cover their heads.

1079
00:57:26,943 --> 00:57:28,877
So try to figure this shit out.

1080
00:57:30,313 --> 00:57:33,544
Catholic men and
Jewish women, no hats.

1081
00:57:33,616 --> 00:57:36,346
Catholic women and
Jewish men, hats.

1082
00:57:36,419 --> 00:57:40,287
Somebody's got the whole thing totally
fucking backward, don't you think?

1083
00:57:48,097 --> 00:57:52,693
And what is this religious
fascination with headgear?

1084
00:57:52,769 --> 00:57:55,431
Every religion has got a
different fucking hat.

1085
00:57:55,505 --> 00:57:57,405
Did you ever notice that?
The Hindus have a turban.

1086
00:57:57,474 --> 00:57:59,271
The Sikhs have a
tall, white turban.

1087
00:57:59,342 --> 00:58:02,539
Jews have yarmulke.
The Muslims have a kufi.

1088
00:58:02,612 --> 00:58:05,740
The Bishop has a pointy hat on one
day and a round hat on another day.

1089
00:58:05,815 --> 00:58:09,512
Cardinal has a red hat, Pope has a white.
Everybody's got a fucking hat.

1090
00:58:09,586 --> 00:58:12,077
One group takes them off;
the other group puts them on.

1091
00:58:12,155 --> 00:58:14,487
Personally, I would never want
to be a member of any group

1092
00:58:14,557 --> 00:58:18,391
where you either have to wear
a hat or you can't wear a hat.

1093
00:58:18,461 --> 00:58:19,758
I think -

1094
00:58:29,606 --> 00:58:32,973
I think all religions should
have one rule and one rule only:

1095
00:58:33,042 --> 00:58:35,909
hats optional.

1096
00:58:35,979 --> 00:58:38,675
That's all you need to run
a really good religion.

1097
00:58:39,482 --> 00:58:42,042
Here's another one of
these civic customs.

1098
00:58:42,118 --> 00:58:44,018
Swearing on the Bible.

1099
00:58:44,087 --> 00:58:45,918
Do you understand that shit?

1100
00:58:45,989 --> 00:58:48,958
They tell you to raise your right hand
and place your left hand on the Bible.

1101
00:58:49,025 --> 00:58:51,493
Does this stuff really
matter which hand?

1102
00:58:51,561 --> 00:58:54,553
Does God really give a fuck
about details like this?

1103
00:58:54,631 --> 00:58:57,566
Suppose you put your right hand on
the Bible and you raise your left hand,

1104
00:58:57,634 --> 00:58:59,534
would that count?

1105
00:58:59,602 --> 00:59:04,062
Or would God say,
"Sorry. Wrong hand. Try again."

1106
00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:08,509
And why does one hand
have to be raised?

1107
00:59:08,578 --> 00:59:11,775
What is the magic
in this gesture?

1108
00:59:11,848 --> 00:59:16,683
This seems like some sort of a
primitive, voodoo, mojo shtick.

1109
00:59:16,753 --> 00:59:18,473
Why not put your
left hand on the Bible

1110
00:59:18,474 --> 00:59:20,450
and let your right hand
hang down by your side?

1111
00:59:20,523 --> 00:59:22,957
It's more natural.
Or put it in your pocket.

1112
00:59:23,026 --> 00:59:24,050
Remember what your
mother used to say?

1113
00:59:24,127 --> 00:59:25,822
Don't put your hands
in your pockets.

1114
00:59:25,895 --> 00:59:28,363
Does she know something
that we don't know?

1115
00:59:28,431 --> 00:59:31,298
Is this hand shit
really important?

1116
00:59:31,367 --> 00:59:32,561
Well, let's get
back to the Bible,

1117
00:59:32,635 --> 00:59:37,368
America's favorite
national theatrical prop.

1118
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:41,467
Suppose the Bible they hand you
to swear on is upside down

1119
00:59:41,544 --> 00:59:43,910
or backward or both,

1120
00:59:43,980 --> 00:59:48,007
and you swear to tell the truth
an upside down, backward Bible.

1121
00:59:48,084 --> 00:59:50,052
Would that count?

1122
00:59:50,119 --> 00:59:55,716
Suppose the Bible they hand you is an
old Bible and half the pages are missing.

1123
00:59:55,792 --> 00:59:58,488
Suppose all they have
is a Chinese Bible

1124
00:59:58,561 --> 01:00:00,654
in an American court,

1125
01:00:00,730 --> 01:00:04,063
or a Braille Bible,
and you're not blind.

1126
01:00:04,133 --> 01:00:06,397
Suppose they hand
you an upside down,

1127
01:00:06,469 --> 01:00:10,405
backward Chinese Braille Bible
with half the pages missing?

1128
01:00:16,713 --> 01:00:19,739
At what point does all of this
stuff just break down

1129
01:00:19,816 --> 01:00:23,980
and become just a lot of stupid
shit that somebody made up?

1130
01:00:24,053 --> 01:00:26,715
They fucking made it up, folks.
It's make-believe.

1131
01:00:26,789 --> 01:00:28,017
It's make-believe.

1132
01:00:28,091 --> 01:00:31,720
Now, all right. Okay.

1133
01:00:35,698 --> 01:00:37,222
Let's leave
the Bible aside.

1134
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:40,758
We'll get back to the science
fiction reading later.

1135
01:00:40,837 --> 01:00:44,068
The more important
question is

1136
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:47,906
what is the big deal about
swearing to God in the first place?

1137
01:00:47,977 --> 01:00:51,674
Why does swearing to God mean
you're going to tell the truth?

1138
01:00:51,748 --> 01:00:53,648
It wouldn't affect me.

1139
01:00:53,716 --> 01:00:55,206
If they said,
"You swear to tell the truth,

1140
01:00:55,284 --> 01:00:57,275
the whole truth and nothing but
the truth, so help you God?"

1141
01:00:57,353 --> 01:01:00,811
I'd say yeah.

1142
01:01:00,890 --> 01:01:03,723
I'll tell you about as much truth as
the people who wrote that fucking Bible.

1143
01:01:03,793 --> 01:01:06,887
How do you like that, huh? Huh?

1144
01:01:12,802 --> 01:01:15,270
Swearing on the Bible
doesn't mean anything.

1145
01:01:15,338 --> 01:01:17,499
It's kid - swearing
to God is kid stuff.

1146
01:01:17,573 --> 01:01:19,473
Did you ever - remember
when you were a kid,

1147
01:01:19,542 --> 01:01:22,067
if you told another kid
something he didn't quite believe

1148
01:01:22,145 --> 01:01:23,976
he'd say,
"You swear to God?"

1149
01:01:24,047 --> 01:01:26,242
I would always say,
"Yeah, I swear to God,"

1150
01:01:26,315 --> 01:01:28,613
even if I was lying.

1151
01:01:28,685 --> 01:01:31,313
Why not?
What's gonna happen if I lie?

1152
01:01:31,387 --> 01:01:33,014
Nothing.

1153
01:01:33,089 --> 01:01:34,886
Nothing happens if you lie

1154
01:01:34,957 --> 01:01:39,018
unless you get caught, and
that's a whole different story.

1155
01:01:39,095 --> 01:01:42,758
Sometimes that kid would think he
was being slick with me and he'd say,

1156
01:01:42,832 --> 01:01:45,392
"You swear on
your mother's grave?"

1157
01:01:45,468 --> 01:01:47,129
I'd say, "Yeah, why not?"

1158
01:01:47,203 --> 01:01:50,730
First of all, my mother was alive.
She didn't have a grave.

1159
01:01:50,807 --> 01:01:52,672
Second of all,
even if she was dead,

1160
01:01:52,742 --> 01:01:56,576
what's she gonna do, rise from
the grave and come and haunt me?

1161
01:01:56,646 --> 01:02:00,173
Come and haunt me all because
I told a lie to an 8-year-old?

1162
01:02:00,249 --> 01:02:02,547
Get fucking real, will you?

1163
01:02:09,892 --> 01:02:14,727
Sometimes I would say,
"I swear on my mother's tits."

1164
01:02:14,797 --> 01:02:17,595
Kids are impressed
with things like that.

1165
01:02:17,667 --> 01:02:19,362
I mean, I don't care about
my mother's tits either.

1166
01:02:19,435 --> 01:02:22,097
I didn't care if they fell off.
Fuck her.

1167
01:02:22,171 --> 01:02:22,967
Not my problem.

1168
01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:26,406
They're your tits, ma.
You keep an eye on them.

1169
01:02:26,476 --> 01:02:28,068
Swearing to God
doesn't mean anything.

1170
01:02:28,144 --> 01:02:29,823
Swearing on the Bible
doesn't mean anything.

1171
01:02:29,824 --> 01:02:30,271
You know why?

1172
01:02:30,346 --> 01:02:33,440
Because Bible or no
Bible, God or no God,

1173
01:02:33,516 --> 01:02:37,646
if it suits their purposes,
people are gonna lie in court.

1174
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:43,317
The police do it all
the time, all the time.

1175
01:02:43,392 --> 01:02:44,791
Yes, they do.

1176
01:02:44,861 --> 01:02:47,830
It's part of their
job to protect, to serve

1177
01:02:47,897 --> 01:02:51,333
and to commit perjury whenever
it supports the state's case.

1178
01:02:52,001 --> 01:02:54,156
Swearing on the Bible
is just one more way

1179
01:02:54,157 --> 01:02:56,461
of controlling people
and keeping them in line,

1180
01:02:56,539 --> 01:03:00,168
and it's one more thing that
holds us back as a species.

1181
01:03:00,243 --> 01:03:03,076
Here's one more item for you,
the last in our civics book:

1182
01:03:03,146 --> 01:03:03,805
rights.

1183
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:05,472
Boy, everyone in this country
is always running around,

1184
01:03:05,548 --> 01:03:07,015
yammering about
their fucking rights.

1185
01:03:07,083 --> 01:03:08,846
I have a right. You have no right.
We have a right.

1186
01:03:08,918 --> 01:03:09,782
They don't a have right.

1187
01:03:09,852 --> 01:03:11,786
Folks,
I hate to spoil your fun but

1188
01:03:11,854 --> 01:03:13,879
there's no such thing
as rights, okay.

1189
01:03:13,956 --> 01:03:14,888
They're imaginary.

1190
01:03:14,957 --> 01:03:17,983
We made them up,
like the Boogie Man,

1191
01:03:18,060 --> 01:03:21,154
the Three Little Pigs, Pinocchio,
Mother Goose, shit like that.

1192
01:03:21,230 --> 01:03:23,460
Rights are an idea.
They're just imaginary.

1193
01:03:23,533 --> 01:03:25,797
They're a cute idea.
Cute but that's all.

1194
01:03:25,868 --> 01:03:27,426
Cute and fictional.

1195
01:03:27,503 --> 01:03:30,097
But if you think you do have
rights let me ask you this,

1196
01:03:30,173 --> 01:03:31,367
where do they come from?

1197
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:33,931
People say, "Well, they come from
God. They're God-given rights."

1198
01:03:34,010 --> 01:03:38,470
Oh, fuck, here we go again.
Here we go again.

1199
01:03:38,548 --> 01:03:39,708
The God excuse.

1200
01:03:39,782 --> 01:03:43,343
The last refuge of a man with
no answers and no argument,

1201
01:03:43,419 --> 01:03:44,511
"They came from God."

1202
01:03:44,587 --> 01:03:47,215
Anything we can't describe
must have come from God.

1203
01:03:47,290 --> 01:03:50,691
Personally, folks, I believe
that if your rights came from God

1204
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:53,058
he would have given you the
right to some food everyday,

1205
01:03:53,129 --> 01:03:55,393
and he would have given you the
right to a roof over your head.

1206
01:03:55,464 --> 01:03:57,864
God would have been
looking out for you.

1207
01:03:57,934 --> 01:04:01,802
God would have been looking
out for you, you know that?

1208
01:04:04,373 --> 01:04:06,466
He wouldn't have been worrying
about making sure you have a gun

1209
01:04:06,542 --> 01:04:10,535
so you can get drunk on Sunday night
and kill your girlfriend's parents.

1210
01:04:10,613 --> 01:04:13,776
But let's say it's true. Let's
say God gave us these rights.

1211
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:16,648
Why would he give us a
certain number of rights?

1212
01:04:16,719 --> 01:04:20,246
The Bill of Rights in this
country has ten stipulations, okay.

1213
01:04:20,323 --> 01:04:21,585
Ten rights.

1214
01:04:21,657 --> 01:04:24,990
And apparently God was doing
sloppy work that week because

1215
01:04:25,061 --> 01:04:29,157
we've had to amend the Bill of
Rights an additional 17 times,

1216
01:04:29,232 --> 01:04:34,101
so God forgot a couple
of things like slavery.

1217
01:04:34,170 --> 01:04:37,901
Just fucking slipped his mind.

1218
01:04:37,974 --> 01:04:41,432
But let's say God
gave us the original ten.

1219
01:04:41,510 --> 01:04:43,273
He gave the British 13.

1220
01:04:43,346 --> 01:04:46,281
The British Bill of Rights
has 13 stipulations.

1221
01:04:46,349 --> 01:04:48,442
The Germans have 29.

1222
01:04:48,517 --> 01:04:50,109
The Belgians have 25.

1223
01:04:50,186 --> 01:04:51,881
The Swedish have only 6.

1224
01:04:51,954 --> 01:04:54,616
And some people in the world
have no rights at all.

1225
01:04:54,690 --> 01:04:58,558
What kind of a fucking, goddamn,
God-giving deal is that?

1226
01:04:58,628 --> 01:05:00,391
No rights at all?

1227
01:05:00,463 --> 01:05:03,694
Why would God give different
people in different countries

1228
01:05:03,766 --> 01:05:06,291
different numbers
of different rights?

1229
01:05:06,369 --> 01:05:07,996
Boredom?

1230
01:05:08,070 --> 01:05:09,537
Amusement?

1231
01:05:09,605 --> 01:05:11,539
Bad arithmetic?

1232
01:05:11,607 --> 01:05:15,112
Do we find out at long
last after all this time

1233
01:05:15,113 --> 01:05:17,375
that God is weak in math skills?

1234
01:05:17,446 --> 01:05:20,381
Doesn't sound like
divine planning to me.

1235
01:05:20,449 --> 01:05:22,849
Sounds more like human planning.

1236
01:05:22,919 --> 01:05:25,911
Sounds more like one group
trying to control another group.

1237
01:05:25,988 --> 01:05:28,889
In other words, business
as usual in America.

1238
01:05:28,958 --> 01:05:32,689
Now, if you think you do have
rights, one last assignment for you.

1239
01:05:32,762 --> 01:05:35,595
Next time you're at he
computer get on the internet.

1240
01:05:35,665 --> 01:05:36,996
Go to Wikipedia.

1241
01:05:37,066 --> 01:05:39,728
When you get to Wikipedia, in
the search field for Wikipedia

1242
01:05:39,802 --> 01:05:43,795
I want you to type in
Japanese Americans 1942,

1243
01:05:43,873 --> 01:05:48,207
and you'll find out all about
your precious fucking rights, okay.

1244
01:05:48,277 --> 01:05:50,643
All right. You know about it.

1245
01:05:50,713 --> 01:05:52,146
You know about it.

1246
01:05:53,883 --> 01:05:55,077
Yeah.

1247
01:05:55,151 --> 01:06:01,420
In 1942 there were 110,000
Japanese-American citizens

1248
01:06:01,490 --> 01:06:03,822
in good standing,
law-abiding people,

1249
01:06:03,893 --> 01:06:06,691
who were thrown into
internment camps

1250
01:06:06,762 --> 01:06:10,254
simply because their parents
were born in the wrong country.

1251
01:06:10,333 --> 01:06:11,322
That's all they did wrong.

1252
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:14,233
They had no right to a lawyer,
no right to a fair trial,

1253
01:06:14,303 --> 01:06:15,998
no right to a jury
of their peers.

1254
01:06:16,072 --> 01:06:18,563
No right to due
process of any kind.

1255
01:06:18,641 --> 01:06:19,938
The only right they had?

1256
01:06:20,009 --> 01:06:24,173
Right this way into
the interment camps.

1257
01:06:24,246 --> 01:06:28,683
Just when these American citizens
needed their rights the most,

1258
01:06:28,751 --> 01:06:31,276
their government
took them away,

1259
01:06:31,354 --> 01:06:34,721
and rights aren't rights if
someone can take them away.

1260
01:06:34,790 --> 01:06:35,882
They're privileges.

1261
01:06:35,958 --> 01:06:38,443
That's all we've ever
had in this country

1262
01:06:38,444 --> 01:06:40,395
is a bill of temporary privileges.

1263
01:06:40,463 --> 01:06:42,795
And if you read
the news even badly

1264
01:06:42,865 --> 01:06:47,427
you know that every year the list
gets shorter and shorter and shorter.

1265
01:06:47,503 --> 01:06:49,403
You see how silly that is.

1266
01:06:55,111 --> 01:06:56,203
Yeah.

1267
01:06:56,278 --> 01:06:58,473
Sooner or later the people in
this country are going to realize

1268
01:06:58,547 --> 01:07:00,879
the government does
not give a fuck about them.

1269
01:07:00,950 --> 01:07:03,145
The government doesn't care
about you or your children

1270
01:07:03,219 --> 01:07:05,619
or your rights or your
welfare or your safety.

1271
01:07:05,688 --> 01:07:07,883
It simply doesn't
give a fuck about you.

1272
01:07:07,957 --> 01:07:09,652
It's interested
in its own power.

1273
01:07:09,725 --> 01:07:13,183
That's the only thing keeping it
and expanding it wherever possible.

1274
01:07:13,262 --> 01:07:14,889
Personally, when
it comes to rights,

1275
01:07:14,964 --> 01:07:16,955
I think one of two
things is true.

1276
01:07:17,033 --> 01:07:19,763
I think either we have
unlimited rights

1277
01:07:19,835 --> 01:07:21,996
or we have no rights at all.

1278
01:07:22,071 --> 01:07:25,199
Personally I lean toward
unlimited rights.

1279
01:07:25,274 --> 01:07:28,710
I feel, for instance, I have the
right to do anything I please.

1280
01:07:28,778 --> 01:07:31,110
But if I do something
you don't like,

1281
01:07:31,180 --> 01:07:34,581
I think you have the
right to kill me.

1282
01:07:34,650 --> 01:07:38,245
So where are you going to find
a fairer fucking deal than that?

1283
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:40,618
So the next time some
asshole says to you,

1284
01:07:40,689 --> 01:07:43,089
"I have a right to my
opinion,"you say,"Oh yeah?

1285
01:07:43,159 --> 01:07:44,558
Well I have a right
to my opinion,

1286
01:07:44,627 --> 01:07:47,425
and my opinion is you have
no right to your opinion."

1287
01:07:47,496 --> 01:07:50,522
Then shoot the
fuck and walk away.

1288
01:07:51,467 --> 01:07:52,365
Thank you.

1289
