1
00:00:53,554 --> 00:00:55,956
Where the hell are you?

2
00:00:56,490 --> 00:01:00,161
I am going to beat your little
ass if you don't get out here!

3
00:01:21,349 --> 00:01:23,917
I've gone over this for two
days.

4
00:01:23,951 --> 00:01:27,155
I don't remember anything.

5
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:32,560
Mommy? Mommy?

6
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:44,605
Look what I got for you.

7
00:01:44,672 --> 00:01:46,640
Shit...

8
00:01:58,452 --> 00:02:00,221
Go away.

9
00:02:03,357 --> 00:02:04,858
Go away.

10
00:02:07,828 --> 00:02:11,365
GO AWAY!!!

11
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:17,238
Can you tell me about Jeremy
Dorian?

12
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:20,608
Where did you two meet?

13
00:02:21,309 --> 00:02:24,278
I don't want to talk about
Jeremy.

14
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:29,383
Why are you guys doing this to
me?

15
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:33,153
Why am I still here?

16
00:02:35,223 --> 00:02:37,625
Is he your boyfriend?

17
00:02:43,331 --> 00:02:46,267
Again, my name is Dr. Carter
Moore.

18
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,337
You waived your right to an
attorney,

19
00:02:49,403 --> 00:02:52,172
And I'm just here to speak
with you.

20
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:58,879
I honestly don't remember
anything.

21
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:06,787
That's alright. Let's just
start at the beginning.

22
00:04:51,859 --> 00:04:53,827
Jeremy?

23
00:04:55,929 --> 00:04:57,264
Thank you.

24
00:04:57,297 --> 00:05:00,834
Aw, you shouldn't have.
Come on in.

25
00:05:01,201 --> 00:05:03,337
So how long have you worked
here?

26
00:05:04,171 --> 00:05:05,939
About three years.

27
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:09,209
Keeps me out of trouble.

28
00:05:09,242 --> 00:05:12,212
Trouble? What kind of trouble?

29
00:05:12,846 --> 00:05:14,915
Thank you for the flowers
by the way.

30
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:17,485
A gentleman always brings
flowers on a first date.

31
00:05:18,486 --> 00:05:22,155
Oh wait, sorry. It's not a date.
It's coffee.

32
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:25,092
I'm not used to guys being so
nice to me.

33
00:05:25,192 --> 00:05:28,362
Oh, come on.
That is hard to believe.

34
00:05:28,429 --> 00:05:30,964
No ones ever got me flowers
before.

35
00:05:31,298 --> 00:05:33,801
Well, I did.

36
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:36,604
You did...

37
00:05:40,307 --> 00:05:43,877
Oh my god... Why am I
so nervous?

38
00:05:45,746 --> 00:05:48,115
I guess I don't get out much.

39
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:52,119
That's impossible.
You're beautiful.

40
00:05:56,323 --> 00:05:58,726
Thank you.

41
00:06:01,962 --> 00:06:04,832
God, your shaking.

42
00:06:07,768 --> 00:06:09,369
Why?

43
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:11,705
Can I kiss you?

44
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:10,764
I wanna feel you inside me.

45
00:07:12,065 --> 00:07:13,767
Okay.

46
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:08,081
Shhhhh...

47
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:11,551
Not now.

48
00:09:11,652 --> 00:09:14,788
Not now. Please stop.

49
00:09:15,255 --> 00:09:17,390
Not right now.

50
00:09:17,691 --> 00:09:22,830
I thought you would never come.
I'm so pleased you did.

51
00:09:23,263 --> 00:09:27,467
I didn't know you wanted me to.
It took some homework

52
00:09:27,534 --> 00:09:29,202
Trying to find you.

53
00:09:33,106 --> 00:09:36,143
Caleb. My boy.

54
00:09:38,646 --> 00:09:42,683
My baby boy Caleb. Look at you!

55
00:09:42,783 --> 00:09:46,887
You have grown to be such a
big boy.

56
00:09:54,494 --> 00:09:57,330
Why do you cover up your hair
like that?

57
00:09:57,464 --> 00:10:00,834
You have such a nice

58
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:04,938
Head of hair. Just like me.

59
00:10:05,806 --> 00:10:07,775
Not like your father.

60
00:10:09,409 --> 00:10:11,311
Like me.

61
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:18,285
Caleb...

62
00:10:18,418 --> 00:10:20,888
My boy Caleb...

63
00:10:23,757 --> 00:10:26,794
Where have you been? Huh?

64
00:10:28,696 --> 00:10:31,164
You left me mom.

65
00:10:32,332 --> 00:10:34,234
Gave me up.

66
00:10:36,403 --> 00:10:38,305
I'm here now.

67
00:10:39,707 --> 00:10:42,009
You've come home.

68
00:10:42,409 --> 00:10:44,211
Cay?

69
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:50,283
Cay?

70
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,822
Caleb?

71
00:10:55,756 --> 00:10:58,125
Cay, you awake?

72
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,796
There's something I wanna
tell you.

73
00:11:25,385 --> 00:11:28,789
And I woke up, he was gone.

74
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:33,026
How did that make you feel?

75
00:11:34,061 --> 00:11:35,462
Abandoned.

76
00:11:36,129 --> 00:11:37,597
Alone.

77
00:11:38,131 --> 00:11:40,333
How would that make you feel?

78
00:11:43,871 --> 00:11:45,038
I've listened to everything

79
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:47,908
Everyone has said. I just
want to go home.

80
00:11:48,341 --> 00:11:51,444
Caleb... You can't go home.

81
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:55,783
We need to find out what
happened.

82
00:11:58,118 --> 00:12:00,720
I don't know where the blood
came from.

83
00:12:18,171 --> 00:12:19,807
Can I help you?

84
00:12:19,873 --> 00:12:21,541
How are you?

85
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:23,676
What can I get you?

86
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:27,781
Ahhh... Cappuccino. No Whip.

87
00:12:35,222 --> 00:12:36,924
So how are you?

88
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:39,759
What's that?

89
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:42,162
How are you?

90
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:47,034
Busy.

91
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,970
It's good to see you.

92
00:12:57,744 --> 00:12:59,847
What else can I get you?

93
00:12:59,947 --> 00:13:01,915
Did I do something wrong?

94
00:13:01,982 --> 00:13:05,853
Yeah. As a matter of fact, you
did. You left.

95
00:13:06,686 --> 00:13:10,523
No note, no phone number.
Nothing.

96
00:13:10,891 --> 00:13:12,926
That was three days ago.

97
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:17,364
I'm sorry.
That's why I'm here.

98
00:13:22,269 --> 00:13:25,272
Caleb. I'm sorry.

99
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:29,142
I didn't mean to make you this
upset.

100
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:32,245
I knew I'd see you again.

101
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:34,347
Yeah, well I didn't.

102
00:13:34,848 --> 00:13:37,050
Have dinner with me.

103
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:46,626
Okay.

104
00:13:47,227 --> 00:13:49,362
But let me make this better.

105
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:51,198
Please...

106
00:13:52,099 --> 00:13:56,069
This has got to be the best
Chinese food I've ever had.

107
00:13:56,503 --> 00:13:57,971
Yeah.

108
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,674
I thought sitting by the
fireplace

109
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:04,144
Would be kinda romantic.

110
00:14:07,647 --> 00:14:09,950
I really love your place.

111
00:14:10,817 --> 00:14:13,086
Thanks. So do I.

112
00:14:14,421 --> 00:14:17,557
It was left to me
when my mom died.

113
00:14:22,729 --> 00:14:25,398
I'm sorry to hear that.

114
00:14:25,498 --> 00:14:27,400
How'd she die?

115
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,536
Leukemia.

116
00:14:30,403 --> 00:14:33,673
She wasn't my real mom.
I just call her that 'cause

117
00:14:33,673 --> 00:14:35,608
She's the closest thing.

118
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:42,149
I don't know my real dad
either.

119
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:49,089
I was adopted.

120
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:53,226
Spent most of my childhood in
foster care.

121
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:57,297
You know, in and out,
in and out.

122
00:14:58,465 --> 00:15:01,568
I guess you could say I was a
little troubled one.

123
00:15:04,271 --> 00:15:07,107
And then I met this older
couple.

124
00:15:07,174 --> 00:15:10,978
Karen and Bill. Gave me a
stable home.

125
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:16,449
They knew I was gay from the
beginning. No problem with it.

126
00:15:18,518 --> 00:15:20,287
Long story short: Karen

127
00:15:20,287 --> 00:15:22,956
Caught Bill cheating and
she kicked him out.

128
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:29,963
So, shortly thereafter she was
diagnosed with Leukemia.

129
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:34,434
And two days before my 17th
birthday, she died.

130
00:15:37,204 --> 00:15:39,572
They let me back here when I
was 18.

131
00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:43,510
By leaving me this place, she
made sure I

132
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:46,313
Would always have a home.

133
00:15:48,815 --> 00:15:52,485
You, mister, are very brave.

134
00:15:54,021 --> 00:15:55,788
I think that

135
00:15:55,888 --> 00:15:59,026
All that stuff you've gone
through,

136
00:15:59,092 --> 00:16:01,561
Has made you into the
man you are today.

137
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,397
I guess.

138
00:16:08,101 --> 00:16:10,370
Why are you so nice to me?

139
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,405
Because I like you.

140
00:16:15,542 --> 00:16:18,411
You're sweet. You're open.

141
00:16:19,046 --> 00:16:21,248
You're honest.

142
00:16:21,948 --> 00:16:24,617
I never met anybody
like you before.

143
00:16:25,418 --> 00:16:28,088
I never told anyone that
stuff before.

144
00:16:29,789 --> 00:16:32,625
Well, I'm glad you did.

145
00:16:35,095 --> 00:16:39,132
Now, are you ready for desert?

146
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:41,534
Hell, yeah!

147
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:56,883
Scoop! Not that much! Pick that
up!

148
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:59,086
Damn. Alright, that's good,
that's good.

149
00:16:59,152 --> 00:17:00,587
I can't eat all that.

150
00:17:00,787 --> 00:17:03,356
What are you talking
about? You can eat all that.

151
00:17:03,456 --> 00:17:07,060
Alright, a little more. A
little more. Oh yeah...

152
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:11,264
More? No, I'm going over here.

153
00:17:12,399 --> 00:17:15,468
So what is with all these
horses?

154
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:23,143
Childhood fantasy. I love
horses. This one...

155
00:17:27,747 --> 00:17:30,550
I've had since I was...

156
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,819
4, I think.

157
00:17:37,757 --> 00:17:39,226
It's my favorite.

158
00:17:42,195 --> 00:17:43,863
I've been collecting since...

159
00:17:44,131 --> 00:17:46,366
My entire life.

160
00:17:52,505 --> 00:17:54,207
My one constant.

161
00:17:57,177 --> 00:18:00,213
I used to... hide.

162
00:18:01,013 --> 00:18:03,015
Hide in my closet.

163
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:05,552
And sit with this one,
and hope and pray

164
00:18:05,718 --> 00:18:11,258
That one day, he would come
to life, right, and just

165
00:18:11,524 --> 00:18:14,561
Take me away from all the hell
that I was living.

166
00:18:15,862 --> 00:18:17,797
You ever ride one?

167
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:21,000
A few times. In Vermont.

168
00:18:21,067 --> 00:18:23,336
Well, we should go.

169
00:18:23,636 --> 00:18:25,405
To Vermont?

170
00:18:25,505 --> 00:18:29,809
No, nimrod!
Horseback riding.

171
00:18:30,243 --> 00:18:33,213
You'd do that with me?

172
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:35,182
Yeah...

173
00:18:42,589 --> 00:18:45,892
You do realize this is
disgusting, don't you?

174
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:50,530
Oh come on, leave poor
Hermie alone.

175
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:53,600
You know, there is only
one thing

176
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:56,536
I hate in this world, and it's
nasty, hairy spiders.

177
00:18:56,669 --> 00:19:00,173
Oh come on, he's only a little
bit poisonous.

178
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:02,675
Don't tap the
glass!

179
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:06,979
I mean, couldn't you settle
for like a dog or a cat?

180
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:11,083
No. I don't like yappy little
Paris Hilton dogs and lord

181
00:19:11,117 --> 00:19:13,353
Knows, I ain't into pussy!

182
00:19:14,621 --> 00:19:16,723
What does one do with a spider
anyway?

183
00:19:16,723 --> 00:19:19,592
I mean, you can't take him out
and play with him?

184
00:19:19,626 --> 00:19:23,029
Sure you can.
I take him out all the time.

185
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:25,164
Let him roam all over me.

186
00:19:25,232 --> 00:19:27,934
Remind me not to be here
when you do that.

187
00:19:29,536 --> 00:19:30,970
AHHHHHH!

188
00:19:31,103 --> 00:19:33,005
Oh fuck! You ass!

189
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,808
You sure you don't wanna hold
him?

190
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:39,712
No! I would shit myself. Twice.

191
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:46,719
Come on you big baby, let's go.

192
00:19:52,425 --> 00:19:53,693
Don't tap the glass!

193
00:19:56,128 --> 00:19:58,498
I could stay like this forever.

194
00:19:58,565 --> 00:20:00,733
Me, too.

195
00:20:01,401 --> 00:20:04,371
Tell something about you that
nobody else knows.

196
00:20:07,674 --> 00:20:09,542
I take Lipitor.

197
00:20:09,976 --> 00:20:12,479
I already knew you were old.

198
00:20:15,448 --> 00:20:19,852
No seriously, I wanna know
everything about you.

199
00:20:23,022 --> 00:20:24,457
Okay...

200
00:20:28,261 --> 00:20:30,963
I'm a recovering addict and
alcoholic.

201
00:20:31,964 --> 00:20:34,233
I've been sober for 15 years.

202
00:20:36,002 --> 00:20:37,837
No shit...

203
00:20:39,639 --> 00:20:42,875
I call it a gift that my
alcoholic mother never got.

204
00:20:46,346 --> 00:20:48,381
Wow... she's not alive?

205
00:20:48,415 --> 00:20:53,085
No. She died when I was 23.

206
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:55,288
From drinking?

207
00:20:56,856 --> 00:21:00,793
Yeah... She was in rehab,
and then she went to a

208
00:21:00,927 --> 00:21:05,398
Halfway house. She wanted out.
She came to live with me.

209
00:21:06,132 --> 00:21:09,369
I couldn't take it anymore.

210
00:21:12,639 --> 00:21:14,607
What happened?

211
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:19,346
They found her body submerged
in the bathtub after the whole

212
00:21:19,446 --> 00:21:21,047
House flooded.

213
00:21:22,749 --> 00:21:24,917
And for the longest
time I didn't know

214
00:21:24,951 --> 00:21:27,587
If she drowned or...

215
00:21:28,855 --> 00:21:30,923
Drank herself to death.

216
00:21:32,058 --> 00:21:33,760
I'm so sorry.

217
00:21:35,562 --> 00:21:40,467
You know, that didn't even stop
me? I kept using for years

218
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:44,671
And I just finally got sick
and tired of being

219
00:21:44,871 --> 00:21:47,006
Sick and tired.

220
00:21:49,576 --> 00:21:53,045
So there ya go! There's one of
my big secrets.

221
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:57,350
Wow...

222
00:21:58,284 --> 00:22:00,853
I wasn't expecting that one.

223
00:22:01,621 --> 00:22:04,857
So you haven't drank or smoked
weed

224
00:22:05,057 --> 00:22:09,729
Or done anything in 15 years?
Not even a little bit?

225
00:22:10,697 --> 00:22:11,998
Nope.

226
00:22:15,234 --> 00:22:17,670
I call that grace.

227
00:22:19,105 --> 00:22:21,708
I never thought of it like that.

228
00:22:21,941 --> 00:22:25,978
That you can do anything you
set your heart to.

229
00:22:33,586 --> 00:22:36,923
Man, I can't believe this is
real.

230
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:43,362
Well, why don't you pinch me
and find out?

231
00:22:45,832 --> 00:22:47,934
You're such a nerd!

232
00:22:48,067 --> 00:22:49,569
Shut it!

233
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:42,589
He was like my knight in
shinning armor.

234
00:23:43,856 --> 00:23:46,926
I never met someone who really
listens to me the way he does.

235
00:23:47,694 --> 00:23:50,563
It sounds like you're quite
enamored with Jeremy.

236
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:57,470
Where is he?
Does he know I'm in here?

237
00:23:57,970 --> 00:24:02,041
Let me ask you
something... would you ever

238
00:24:02,174 --> 00:24:06,012
Intentionally do something to
Jeremy that would hurt him?

239
00:24:07,113 --> 00:24:10,349
No. Absolutely not.

240
00:24:10,883 --> 00:24:12,952
Why would you say something
like that?

241
00:24:15,655 --> 00:24:17,790
I need to see him.

242
00:24:18,357 --> 00:24:19,659
NOW!!!

243
00:24:23,329 --> 00:24:27,166
You're very angry.
I understand that.

244
00:24:27,366 --> 00:24:29,969
You don't understand shit!

245
00:24:31,704 --> 00:24:33,740
You have no idea what it's
like to be me.

246
00:24:33,773 --> 00:24:36,743
That's exactly what we need to
find out.

247
00:24:37,977 --> 00:24:42,915
I don't need to hear this right
now... I don't get this...

248
00:24:52,692 --> 00:24:54,994
Give me that god damn it!
How many times do I have to

249
00:24:55,094 --> 00:24:59,065
Tell you? Not at the dinner
table. There!

250
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:03,335
Now maybe you'll finish your
dinner.

251
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:07,574
You are not leaving this table
until you finish every god damn

252
00:25:07,574 --> 00:25:10,076
Bit of that. Do you hear me?

253
00:25:12,278 --> 00:25:13,345
Do you hear me?

254
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:15,582
But I don't like it mommy.

255
00:25:15,648 --> 00:25:20,119
EAT! Eat! Eat!!

256
00:25:20,753 --> 00:25:27,727
Eat you little pussy boy!
Eat. Eat! Eat! Eat!

257
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:38,605
Go to bed.

258
00:25:43,976 --> 00:25:46,613
That must have been really
hard for you.

259
00:25:49,248 --> 00:25:51,150
I never told anyone.

260
00:25:57,556 --> 00:25:59,659
Are you sure this doesn't
bother you?

261
00:26:01,193 --> 00:26:02,328
No.

262
00:26:03,129 --> 00:26:07,667
It's cool. And you don't have
to keep asking me.

263
00:26:10,002 --> 00:26:12,605
I just don't want you to be
tempted.

264
00:26:16,709 --> 00:26:19,646
I really needed to unwind
tonight.

265
00:26:22,281 --> 00:26:24,216
I know baby.

266
00:26:38,164 --> 00:26:39,565
You know...

267
00:26:39,966 --> 00:26:44,036
You really need to realize that
there is so much good in you.

268
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:48,808
Validating that good is...

269
00:26:48,875 --> 00:26:52,645
Not always an easy thing to do.

270
00:26:56,182 --> 00:26:57,850
I just feel alone.

271
00:26:58,384 --> 00:27:00,619
I feel so alone sometimes.

272
00:27:02,121 --> 00:27:05,224
Like I can't...

273
00:27:05,224 --> 00:27:08,627
Shake this feeling of being
abandoned.

274
00:27:12,031 --> 00:27:13,666
But you...

275
00:27:14,667 --> 00:27:17,303
You can change that.

276
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:20,272
That is all up to you.

277
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:25,511
Besides...

278
00:27:25,945 --> 00:27:29,081
You, mister, have me now.

279
00:27:32,518 --> 00:27:34,987
Will you stay with me tonight?

280
00:27:37,056 --> 00:27:40,827
I would love to stay with
you tonight.

281
00:27:46,165 --> 00:27:50,737
Come on sleepyhead! Wake up!
I've got a surprise for you.

282
00:27:56,876 --> 00:27:59,211
Yo! Sleeping beauty!
Wake up!

283
00:27:59,345 --> 00:28:01,113
But it's Saturday.

284
00:28:01,247 --> 00:28:03,149
Yeah, I know. Let's go.

285
00:28:03,816 --> 00:28:05,684
Where are we going?

286
00:28:05,752 --> 00:28:08,254
Come on. Up, up up! I've got a
surprise.

287
00:28:08,287 --> 00:28:09,555
I hate surprises.

288
00:28:09,588 --> 00:28:11,457
I heard that!

289
00:29:11,884 --> 00:29:13,853
Now can you tell me what
we're doing here?

290
00:29:13,986 --> 00:29:15,955
Well, since horses are
the one thing

291
00:29:15,988 --> 00:29:17,023
That brighten that beautiful

292
00:29:17,289 --> 00:29:20,359
Smile, I thought you should
have one of your own.

293
00:29:21,027 --> 00:29:22,561
What are you talking about?

294
00:29:23,062 --> 00:29:25,832
This farm is part of a...
an adopt a horse program.

295
00:29:25,832 --> 00:29:30,102
You get to adopt a old or an
abused horse...

296
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:34,340
Cay, I want you to meet

297
00:29:34,373 --> 00:29:38,277
Nero Fiddles.
Nero, meet your new owner,

298
00:29:38,377 --> 00:29:40,046
Caleb.

299
00:29:44,884 --> 00:29:45,885
You're kidding, right?

300
00:29:46,052 --> 00:29:49,321
She's 15 years old.
She's friendly, healthy.

301
00:29:49,856 --> 00:29:52,524
And I think a big old lesbian.

302
00:29:53,559 --> 00:29:54,693
But just remember, I don't

303
00:29:54,693 --> 00:29:56,628
Shovel shit or anything
like that.

304
00:29:56,762 --> 00:29:59,065
No, of course not.

305
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:04,503
And there's one more thing...

306
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:06,072
What?

307
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:14,113
I just want you to know you
have made me

308
00:30:14,113 --> 00:30:17,249
The happiest I've been in
my entire life.

309
00:30:20,752 --> 00:30:23,489
I never felt this way
about another guy.

310
00:30:27,493 --> 00:30:29,561
I love you so much.

311
00:30:30,963 --> 00:30:33,299
I love you, too.

312
00:30:46,512 --> 00:30:47,914
Thank you.

313
00:30:48,714 --> 00:30:50,449
Thank you.

314
00:30:51,283 --> 00:30:53,920
That was the first time I ever
heard someone tell me that

315
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:56,222
With such conviction.

316
00:30:57,990 --> 00:30:59,959
It was a foreign word to me.

317
00:31:01,127 --> 00:31:03,896
I don't even think I love
myself.

318
00:31:05,631 --> 00:31:07,333
Did you ever?

319
00:31:09,368 --> 00:31:12,371
No. No.

320
00:31:15,407 --> 00:31:16,909
Why is that?

321
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:20,246
I don't know.

322
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:24,450
I never had love.

323
00:31:26,652 --> 00:31:28,554
Growing up... even when I was

324
00:31:28,554 --> 00:31:31,257
A little kid. Being told,

325
00:31:32,424 --> 00:31:35,727
I was a pussy boy or a faggot
all the time.

326
00:31:36,495 --> 00:31:39,565
It doesn't do much for the
self-esteem.

327
00:31:40,366 --> 00:31:42,468
Who called you that?

328
00:31:42,701 --> 00:31:45,371
My mother. For starters.

329
00:31:55,581 --> 00:31:57,316
You're not a pussy.

330
00:31:57,783 --> 00:32:00,252
And you're not a faggot.

331
00:32:02,721 --> 00:32:04,590
I suck dick...

332
00:32:06,058 --> 00:32:08,527
Is that what you think a
faggot is?

333
00:32:09,161 --> 00:32:15,467
What a faggot is... is
disgusting slang. That's all.

334
00:32:17,203 --> 00:32:20,572
Whatever. I'm gay, okay?

335
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:24,643
Well, great. That's not a bad
thing.

336
00:32:30,682 --> 00:32:32,518
Now...

337
00:32:35,387 --> 00:32:38,090
You had love.

338
00:32:40,326 --> 00:32:42,261
Genuine love.

339
00:32:43,895 --> 00:32:45,431
Jeremy.

340
00:32:49,135 --> 00:32:52,438
Ponyboy. You know, from
that movie 'The Outsiders'?

341
00:32:54,273 --> 00:32:56,775
I like the name, but can't say
I've ever seen it.

342
00:32:57,443 --> 00:33:01,147
You young ones today. Can't get
no respect.

343
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:03,615
What about you?

344
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:05,784
Donnie Darko.

345
00:33:05,884 --> 00:33:07,019
Who?

346
00:33:07,353 --> 00:33:10,756
Jake Gyllenhaal.
When he was a teen.

347
00:33:11,257 --> 00:33:14,193
That whole dark and brooding
thing.

348
00:33:15,461 --> 00:33:18,664
He had all that dark hair.
Had that rebel thing going on.

349
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:25,404
I had actually got caught
beatin' off thinking about him.

350
00:33:25,971 --> 00:33:28,074
No. Really?

351
00:33:29,341 --> 00:33:33,279
I had hung this 'Outsiders'
poster on my bedroom wall

352
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:36,815
And I thought I was being all
inconspicuous about it with it

353
00:33:36,815 --> 00:33:38,550
Hung behind my bed.

354
00:33:39,585 --> 00:33:40,252
Ooops.

355
00:33:40,719 --> 00:33:44,890
I'd lay back with my feet on
the pillow and get busy.

356
00:33:45,391 --> 00:33:50,396
My mom comes in with a pile of
laundry and there I am,

357
00:33:50,429 --> 00:33:51,797
Whackin' off.

358
00:33:52,331 --> 00:33:54,333
Choking the chicken,
yeah, go on.

359
00:33:54,566 --> 00:33:58,970
I'd have my shirt pulled up
against my nipples and my

360
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:02,174
Jeans and my underwear
around my ankles.

361
00:34:02,841 --> 00:34:06,445
She walks in, and I'm so caught
off guard that I roll off

362
00:34:06,445 --> 00:34:09,248
The bed and I fall to the
ground.

363
00:34:10,349 --> 00:34:11,483
Classic.

364
00:34:11,683 --> 00:34:14,886
It was like something out of a
Ben Stiller movie, but...

365
00:34:15,821 --> 00:34:20,359
I mean honestly, the real
experience was not that fun.

366
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,595
You were alone.

367
00:34:25,197 --> 00:34:27,333
Now I have you.

368
00:34:30,369 --> 00:34:32,538
So let me ask you something?

369
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,242
Shoot.

370
00:34:36,708 --> 00:34:40,179
You ever think about finding
your mom?

371
00:34:45,584 --> 00:34:47,553
I don't see the point.

372
00:34:49,688 --> 00:34:51,390
Closure.

373
00:34:55,294 --> 00:34:57,496
I have thought about it
sometimes.

374
00:35:00,766 --> 00:35:02,401
Some day.

375
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:12,711
I have a new family.

376
00:35:16,182 --> 00:35:17,883
It's a nice couple.

377
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:19,851
They take really good
care of me.

378
00:35:20,686 --> 00:35:22,221
That's nice, sweetie.

379
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:26,292
Kinda boring, but they're cool.

380
00:35:27,626 --> 00:35:29,328
What's brown and sticky?

381
00:35:30,996 --> 00:35:32,964
I don't know. Poop?

382
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:34,900
No!

383
00:35:35,066 --> 00:35:37,436
A stick, silly!

384
00:35:41,207 --> 00:35:42,808
I'm in school.

385
00:35:43,875 --> 00:35:45,611
I try really hard.

386
00:35:47,279 --> 00:35:48,647
It's alright.

387
00:35:48,647 --> 00:35:50,816
I don't really get the whole
Algebra II thing.

388
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:55,887
What does a perverted
frog say?

389
00:35:58,190 --> 00:35:59,858
I don't know.

390
00:36:04,029 --> 00:36:06,532
Rub it. Rub it.

391
00:36:08,033 --> 00:36:09,468
Rub it.

392
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:19,378
What do you call a lesbian
dinosaur?

393
00:36:20,912 --> 00:36:22,781
Mom...

394
00:36:23,382 --> 00:36:25,384
Lick-a-lota-puss!

395
00:36:28,053 --> 00:36:31,323
Come on Cabby, duh!

396
00:36:38,664 --> 00:36:42,668
Hey, hey... just one more.
One more. Promise.

397
00:36:42,801 --> 00:36:45,337
And then we will go down to
have applesauce.

398
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:48,274
Because, I need my sauce.

399
00:36:50,108 --> 00:36:52,944
Okay... what is the number
one cause...

400
00:36:53,745 --> 00:36:55,747
Of pedophilia?

401
00:37:00,552 --> 00:37:02,288
Sexy babies.

402
00:37:07,025 --> 00:37:09,561
Get it? Get it?

403
00:37:10,362 --> 00:37:12,831
It's sexy babies.

404
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:22,007
It's sexy babies. Sexy babies.
Sexy babies.

405
00:37:22,874 --> 00:37:26,512
It's the babies. The babies.

406
00:38:02,348 --> 00:38:04,950
Why would someone who rarely
cooks have two jars of

407
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:06,652
Cream of Tartar?

408
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:09,287
I honestly don't even
know what that is.

409
00:38:09,355 --> 00:38:10,689
I don't either.

410
00:38:10,722 --> 00:38:12,991
So how long do
we cook this for?

411
00:38:13,091 --> 00:38:14,893
A half hour, maybe.

412
00:38:15,827 --> 00:38:18,730
So where did you learn all this
kitchen stuff.

413
00:38:18,864 --> 00:38:21,733
You don't really even seem
like the cooking type.

414
00:38:23,835 --> 00:38:25,771
Magic.

415
00:38:27,473 --> 00:38:29,675
Oh, I almost forgot.

416
00:38:35,414 --> 00:38:37,215
You shouldn't have.

417
00:38:37,215 --> 00:38:39,351
Just open it.

418
00:38:47,926 --> 00:38:51,062
So I saw it in the
drugstore and thought of you.

419
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:56,568
Oh my god... a Bugs Bunny
toothbrush.

420
00:38:56,568 --> 00:38:58,236
I know, it's silly.

421
00:38:58,236 --> 00:39:02,040
No. It is not silly. It is
very sweet.

422
00:39:02,774 --> 00:39:08,847
I just thought that we could
ummm... take it to the next

423
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:11,082
Step... level...

424
00:39:12,217 --> 00:39:15,421
I just ummm... you could
keep it here.

425
00:39:15,854 --> 00:39:18,390
With no more overnight toiletry
bag.

426
00:39:19,224 --> 00:39:21,860
No more overnight
toiletry bag.

427
00:39:24,129 --> 00:39:26,364
Thanks.

428
00:39:26,865 --> 00:39:29,568
OH! And...

429
00:39:30,702 --> 00:39:31,737
A key.

430
00:39:31,737 --> 00:39:32,571
To your hole?

431
00:39:32,971 --> 00:39:38,477
No! Gross. No, to my heart.
No, the house. It's the house.

432
00:39:40,412 --> 00:39:42,614
To my heart. To the house.

433
00:39:44,483 --> 00:39:48,820
Baby... Thank you.

434
00:39:49,087 --> 00:39:50,622
Of course.

435
00:39:52,858 --> 00:39:55,060
I love you so much.

436
00:40:06,137 --> 00:40:07,906
By the way...

437
00:40:12,377 --> 00:40:14,646
I found her.

438
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:17,015
Your mom.

439
00:40:49,681 --> 00:40:52,450
Cay? Cay, I'm sorry.

440
00:40:52,618 --> 00:40:54,486
I didn't mean to do it.

441
00:40:56,421 --> 00:40:57,856
I'm sorry, alright.

442
00:40:57,923 --> 00:41:02,561
I shouldn't have done that. I
apologize.

443
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:07,833
Just fuckin' stop. Just fuckin'
stop!!! Why can't you be

444
00:41:07,866 --> 00:41:10,235
My fucking boyfriend and not
my keeper!

445
00:41:10,736 --> 00:41:12,704
You have fuckin' no idea!

446
00:41:13,905 --> 00:41:14,640
So what?

447
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:16,107
I thought I was doing
something...

448
00:41:16,107 --> 00:41:19,310
So now you know the Caleb...
the Jacob's fucking family

449
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:22,147
Secret. How do you feel
about it, huh?

450
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:24,282
You wanna know a secret?

451
00:41:24,382 --> 00:41:27,185
I've been keeping tabs on the
bitch the entire time. In the

452
00:41:27,185 --> 00:41:30,421
Fucking loony bin... that's
exactly where she's been!

453
00:41:30,556 --> 00:41:33,291
I knew that! I fucking
knew that!!!

454
00:41:33,291 --> 00:41:34,793
Just calm down...

455
00:41:34,793 --> 00:41:36,995
NO!
Don't tell me to calm down!

456
00:41:36,995 --> 00:41:40,498
I'm sorry, okay! I thought I was
doing something right.

457
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:42,601
You have no fucking idea
how it feels.

458
00:41:42,601 --> 00:41:44,870
You have fucking no idea!!!

459
00:41:47,539 --> 00:41:49,340
Enough! Enough, okay!

460
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:51,176
Shut up!!!!

461
00:41:52,277 --> 00:41:55,681
I'm sorry, alright!

462
00:41:57,583 --> 00:41:59,885
Calm down...

463
00:42:03,288 --> 00:42:07,859
I'm sorry... I'm sorry.

464
00:42:11,262 --> 00:42:12,564
Forget it...

465
00:42:17,268 --> 00:42:18,436
It's okay...

466
00:42:18,604 --> 00:42:20,438
It's NOT okay.

467
00:42:20,505 --> 00:42:24,743
I know it's not okay,
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

468
00:43:42,053 --> 00:43:43,621
I'm gonna cum...

469
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:45,390
Shoot it! Go!

470
00:44:09,748 --> 00:44:12,583
10 minutes. That's all I needed
was 10 fucking minutes,

471
00:44:12,684 --> 00:44:15,220
And I'd be comatose.
That's all I needed.

472
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:17,088
Did you discuss this with
your therapist?

473
00:44:17,322 --> 00:44:20,158
What's the point? I'd just get
another pill, and...

474
00:44:20,759 --> 00:44:23,528
With the right diagnosis
and medication,

475
00:44:23,528 --> 00:44:25,396
It's amazing what can happen.

476
00:44:27,398 --> 00:44:31,837
Let's get something straight!
I'm not her, alright.

477
00:44:34,039 --> 00:44:35,406
I'm not
her.

478
00:44:39,610 --> 00:44:42,113
You're fucking disgusting.

479
00:44:43,014 --> 00:44:45,350
You fucking piece of shit.

480
00:44:47,786 --> 00:44:50,989
You ugly little pussy bitch.

481
00:44:51,857 --> 00:44:55,360
Cum whore. You did this to me.

482
00:44:58,429 --> 00:45:00,465
You...

483
00:45:00,498 --> 00:45:03,902
Made me like this. You did it.

484
00:45:04,335 --> 00:45:08,039
You made me what I am. You!

485
00:45:08,139 --> 00:45:12,377
You! You!
You little faggot!

486
00:45:12,778 --> 00:45:14,445
Little faggot!

487
00:45:19,584 --> 00:45:21,787
I can't stand you.

488
00:45:22,754 --> 00:45:26,724
I cannot stand that I pushed you
out of my vagina.

489
00:45:28,359 --> 00:45:31,797
You ruined me!

490
00:45:34,232 --> 00:45:37,035
You tore up my insides

491
00:45:37,035 --> 00:45:40,038
And stole every piece of me

492
00:45:40,038 --> 00:45:44,776
When you forced your little fat
wrinkly baby

493
00:45:44,776 --> 00:45:48,046
Body into this world.
My heart...

494
00:45:50,715 --> 00:45:54,119
My intestines. My pussy.

495
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:56,888
My fucking anus.

496
00:45:57,555 --> 00:45:59,157
You're gross.

497
00:46:00,091 --> 00:46:05,196
You are disgusting.
I mean, look at you!

498
00:46:05,396 --> 00:46:09,367
Just look at you!!!!!

499
00:46:15,874 --> 00:46:18,709
Look at you. Devil's spawn!

500
00:46:18,977 --> 00:46:22,713
Worse then even the man who
dumped his sperm into me.

501
00:46:22,981 --> 00:46:25,450
And all for what?

502
00:46:26,184 --> 00:46:29,320
For what? So you could run
around sticking

503
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:33,391
AIDS ridden dicks in your
asshole you sad pathetic

504
00:46:35,326 --> 00:46:37,562
Faggot! Homo!

505
00:46:39,530 --> 00:46:43,468
I hate you! I hate you!

506
00:48:00,645 --> 00:48:02,713
You didn't go to the hospital?

507
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:04,782
No, I didn't go to the hospital.

508
00:48:05,083 --> 00:48:06,985
I wasn't gonna leave
you like this.

509
00:48:09,787 --> 00:48:12,958
You and I...
we need to talk.

510
00:48:15,393 --> 00:48:17,095
Do you hate me?

511
00:48:19,064 --> 00:48:23,334
No.
No I don't hate you.

512
00:48:25,303 --> 00:48:27,438
I am the one that you should
hate.

513
00:48:28,039 --> 00:48:31,009
This is all my fault.
I never should have butt in.

514
00:48:31,276 --> 00:48:33,478
This isn't any ones fault.

515
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:37,448
I did this.

516
00:48:45,957 --> 00:48:49,794
I still cannot comprehend why

517
00:48:50,028 --> 00:48:52,463
You would cut yourself
like this.

518
00:48:58,203 --> 00:48:59,370
Ouch...

519
00:49:00,705 --> 00:49:03,208
Ouch. Fuck...

520
00:49:04,342 --> 00:49:05,443
I don't know.

521
00:49:06,244 --> 00:49:08,813
I guess I just wanted the
outsides to look

522
00:49:08,813 --> 00:49:11,216
Like the way I feel on
the inside.

523
00:49:11,249 --> 00:49:13,618
Oh fuck, that's stupid.

524
00:49:13,818 --> 00:49:16,487
You know, suicide is not
an option.

525
00:49:16,554 --> 00:49:17,888
I wasn't gonna do that!

526
00:49:17,888 --> 00:49:21,159
You know, I look at you
and all I see is pain.

527
00:49:22,994 --> 00:49:24,929
I just want to make it better.

528
00:49:24,929 --> 00:49:28,366
You know, that's just it.
Don't try so hard.

529
00:49:28,766 --> 00:49:30,768
I'm not used to all this.

530
00:49:31,369 --> 00:49:34,039
You know, no one has
ever given me this much.

531
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:37,375
And...

532
00:49:40,145 --> 00:49:42,647
Every single time I let
someone in,

533
00:49:43,081 --> 00:49:44,949
They just leave me.

534
00:49:45,316 --> 00:49:48,119
So don't try so hard, okay?

535
00:49:48,753 --> 00:49:51,122
What was I supposed to do?

536
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:55,126
I walk in and I see
you bleeding.

537
00:49:56,361 --> 00:49:59,964
I don't call that trying too
hard, okay.

538
00:50:00,198 --> 00:50:03,201
I call that trying to take
care of somebody I love.

539
00:50:05,936 --> 00:50:08,173
You're not gonna leave
me now, are you?

540
00:50:08,239 --> 00:50:11,242
Did you not just hear what I
said?

541
00:50:14,445 --> 00:50:16,781
I said I love you.

542
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:22,887
You know, the past 8 months
have changed my life

543
00:50:22,887 --> 00:50:25,022
More than you will ever know.

544
00:50:30,561 --> 00:50:32,330
I'm sorry.

545
00:50:33,131 --> 00:50:36,033
I never want to leave you.

546
00:50:41,972 --> 00:50:44,642
You know what you need?

547
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:49,080
A lobotomy?

548
00:50:49,814 --> 00:50:51,416
Maybe.

549
00:50:54,785 --> 00:50:57,722
I think you need a little bit
of Nero in the morning.

550
00:50:58,323 --> 00:50:59,524
Yeah.

551
00:51:00,491 --> 00:51:01,926
How's that sound?

552
00:51:02,127 --> 00:51:03,828
Sounds great.

553
00:52:44,762 --> 00:52:48,233
Fairmont Place. Fairmont Place.
Fairmont Place.

554
00:52:49,234 --> 00:52:51,402
Fairmont Place...

555
00:55:08,873 --> 00:55:12,643
That ones mine. Ready?
Wanna see what it is?

556
00:55:13,978 --> 00:55:16,313
He's good for something.

557
00:55:19,249 --> 00:55:22,487
Aw... cute.

558
00:55:23,421 --> 00:55:25,623
It's adorable.
Thank you.

559
00:55:28,092 --> 00:55:30,495
But Daddy's not going to be the
one getting up in the middle

560
00:55:30,495 --> 00:55:32,863
Of the night feeding her,
now is he?

561
00:55:33,063 --> 00:55:34,532
She knows me like a book.

562
00:55:35,199 --> 00:55:36,834
I'm kidding...

563
00:55:38,268 --> 00:55:41,171
Ooh... She just kicked.

564
00:55:41,439 --> 00:55:46,744
This kid has been going
crazy all day. Honey, feel.

565
00:56:30,855 --> 00:56:33,858
Baby, could you grab the
recycling bin, too?

566
00:56:34,058 --> 00:56:36,927
Aw, you didn't.

567
00:56:38,362 --> 00:56:39,997
These are my favorite.

568
00:56:43,768 --> 00:56:45,302
Don't forget the box
that my Mother brought.

569
00:56:45,302 --> 00:56:46,804
I know, I know.

570
00:56:46,804 --> 00:56:48,639
It's in the car.

571
00:57:09,059 --> 00:57:10,595
For the longest time I

572
00:57:11,696 --> 00:57:14,198
I didn't even love myself.

573
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:17,568
Caleb, you just have to

574
00:57:19,369 --> 00:57:22,540
You have to be completely
honest with me.

575
00:57:25,409 --> 00:57:27,712
If we're gonna make this work.

576
00:57:31,115 --> 00:57:33,484
I like it that way.

577
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:38,088
Me, too.

578
00:57:59,443 --> 00:58:01,546
Why are you doing this to me?

579
00:58:06,851 --> 00:58:09,219
Why are you doing this to me?

580
00:58:12,389 --> 00:58:18,763
Why are you doing this to me?

581
00:58:21,532 --> 00:58:25,135
Why are you...

582
00:58:25,570 --> 00:58:28,005
Fuck you!

583
00:58:58,135 --> 00:59:00,070
I've been waiting for you.

584
00:59:01,038 --> 00:59:04,108
I'm sorry, baby.
I got stuck in the ER.

585
00:59:06,476 --> 00:59:08,245
Come to bed.

586
00:59:29,099 --> 00:59:31,201
I see how this goes.

587
00:59:31,902 --> 00:59:34,672
Is this my
payback for being late?

588
00:59:39,343 --> 00:59:41,211
Scoot.

589
00:59:42,346 --> 00:59:44,982
Aw, you dirty boy.

590
00:59:50,621 --> 00:59:52,623
You have no idea.

591
00:59:59,463 --> 01:00:01,632
Now kiss me.

592
01:00:02,332 --> 01:00:04,068
Close your eyes.

593
01:00:07,304 --> 01:00:08,906
I have a surprise for you.

594
01:00:28,225 --> 01:00:29,259
Can I open?

595
01:00:29,259 --> 01:00:30,294
Shhh.

596
01:00:45,042 --> 01:00:46,944
Daddy's Angel.

597
01:00:47,978 --> 01:00:49,747
How cute.

598
01:00:50,214 --> 01:00:51,816
How did you get these?

599
01:00:53,283 --> 01:00:58,322
Cay, come on. Let me
explain. Just take these off.

600
01:01:00,124 --> 01:01:03,961
I really don't think I
should be around you right now.

601
01:01:08,032 --> 01:01:11,535
Cay... Cay, wait. Let me
explain. Cay, Wait!

602
01:01:11,736 --> 01:01:15,472
Cay! Caleb!
Take these fucking things

603
01:01:15,472 --> 01:01:18,075
Off me. Cay! Cay!

604
01:01:20,077 --> 01:01:23,781
Please stop. Please stop.
Please stop. Please stop.

605
01:01:23,781 --> 01:01:26,550
Please stop. Please stop.
Please stop.

606
01:01:26,550 --> 01:01:28,753
Please stop. Please stop.
Please stop.

607
01:01:28,753 --> 01:01:33,023
Please stop. Please stop.
Please stop.

608
01:01:37,561 --> 01:01:40,898
STOP STOP STOP STOP!

609
01:01:42,232 --> 01:01:43,868
Caleb...

610
01:01:44,534 --> 01:01:46,303
Cay!!!!!

611
01:01:55,679 --> 01:01:58,448
Cay!!!!!

612
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:08,625
Shut up! Shut up! SHUT UP!

613
01:02:09,126 --> 01:02:13,263
You fucking pussy. I can't
stand this shit!

614
01:03:13,123 --> 01:03:15,325
Ahhhhh!!!!!

615
01:03:15,392 --> 01:03:17,061
Ahhhhhhhhh!!!!

616
01:03:17,194 --> 01:03:20,530
Ahhhhh!!!

617
01:03:24,969 --> 01:03:27,804
You're fucking crazy!

618
01:03:28,338 --> 01:03:30,074
What did you call me?

619
01:03:30,340 --> 01:03:34,945
I have been in here for hours.
You fucking psycho!

620
01:03:37,281 --> 01:03:38,448
Please don't hit me.

621
01:03:38,448 --> 01:03:40,717
- Please don't hit me.
- Please don't hit me.

622
01:03:41,418 --> 01:03:44,688
Listen to you. You sound like a
faggot. You are a faggot,

623
01:03:44,688 --> 01:03:46,723
Right? RIGHT?

624
01:03:46,823 --> 01:03:49,326
Take these off of me.

625
01:03:49,559 --> 01:03:51,996
Answer the question.

626
01:03:53,697 --> 01:03:55,365
Yes.

627
01:03:55,632 --> 01:03:58,002
Louder. I wanna hear it again.

628
01:03:58,335 --> 01:03:59,870
Yes.

629
01:04:01,505 --> 01:04:05,976
Very good. Now see, I know that.
And you know that.

630
01:04:06,810 --> 01:04:09,213
But does your wife know that?

631
01:04:09,213 --> 01:04:12,149
Why are you doing this to me?

632
01:04:13,517 --> 01:04:17,454
Why? Why? Listen to you.

633
01:04:18,088 --> 01:04:20,357
Damn, you are pathetic.

634
01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:24,794
You're nothing but a two-faced
liar.

635
01:04:24,794 --> 01:04:28,632
No...
Nothing that we did was a lie.

636
01:04:29,433 --> 01:04:36,173
She's a fucking cunt. A cunt.
That just blows my mind.

637
01:04:37,807 --> 01:04:41,245
And she's pregnant. She's
pregnant, too?

638
01:04:41,511 --> 01:04:43,447
Take that off of me.

639
01:04:46,316 --> 01:04:49,286
Your wife should really lock
the back door.

640
01:04:50,054 --> 01:04:53,090
Please tell me you didn't
hurt her.

641
01:04:53,423 --> 01:04:57,594
She's fine.
What do you think I am?

642
01:05:01,831 --> 01:05:06,103
I'm sorry, baby. I'm so sorry.

643
01:05:06,136 --> 01:05:10,674
SHUT UP! You're not who I
thought you were.

644
01:05:11,108 --> 01:05:13,010
You're just like everybody else.

645
01:05:13,010 --> 01:05:16,246
No. You're not listening.

646
01:05:17,847 --> 01:05:19,649
I'm sorry.

647
01:05:20,817 --> 01:05:24,588
Shut UP! Just stop.

648
01:05:30,594 --> 01:05:33,063
I can't breathe...

649
01:05:34,498 --> 01:05:37,934
Please let me go. I won't tell
anyone. Please...

650
01:05:37,934 --> 01:05:40,104
Just let me go.

651
01:05:40,504 --> 01:05:42,006
I know...

652
01:05:42,973 --> 01:05:46,476
You're too afraid.
What would you say?

653
01:05:47,111 --> 01:05:49,913
I'm sucking some kid's dick?

654
01:05:50,247 --> 01:05:53,450
The Ms. would love that.

655
01:05:58,055 --> 01:06:01,191
How long do you plan on
keeping me here?

656
01:06:07,831 --> 01:06:11,368
Until you tell me the truth.

657
01:06:22,879 --> 01:06:26,250
Have you heard of Brief
Reactive Psychosis?

658
01:06:27,051 --> 01:06:30,154
No... Enlighten me.

659
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:33,857
It's usually triggered by an
extremely stressful event in

660
01:06:33,857 --> 01:06:38,062
Ones life.
You've had many recently.

661
01:06:38,695 --> 01:06:43,267
The subject tends to hear
voices and hallucinate.

662
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:46,536
To see and hear things that
aren't really there.

663
01:06:46,536 --> 01:06:49,606
They do things they wouldn't
normally ever do.

664
01:06:51,841 --> 01:06:54,444
Does this sound familiar?

665
01:06:59,716 --> 01:07:04,054
We've talked about your life
growing up. The abandonment.

666
01:07:04,521 --> 01:07:07,657
So... what's that got to do with
why I'm here?

667
01:07:09,526 --> 01:07:13,130
I'm thinking that perhaps the
new details

668
01:07:13,130 --> 01:07:16,466
You've discovered about
Jeremy's life may have been

669
01:07:16,466 --> 01:07:19,069
A trigger for what transpired
with him.

670
01:07:20,504 --> 01:07:23,240
You people keep saying what's
transpired with Jeremy.

671
01:07:23,340 --> 01:07:25,609
I don't know what you're
talking about.

672
01:07:25,742 --> 01:07:27,144
Do you hear yourself?

673
01:07:27,277 --> 01:07:31,215
You have an acute
reaction to rejection.

674
01:07:36,486 --> 01:07:40,424
There's only so many times
I can pick myself up again.

675
01:07:42,959 --> 01:07:45,262
So many credit cards...

676
01:07:47,731 --> 01:07:49,433
Oh, whose Don?

677
01:07:50,033 --> 01:07:51,701
Do you fuck him, too?

678
01:07:53,937 --> 01:07:56,206
Should I take that as a yes?

679
01:07:57,006 --> 01:07:58,074
No.

680
01:07:58,142 --> 01:07:59,343
Ooh, look at that...

681
01:07:59,343 --> 01:08:01,945
It's the first word you
said in hours.

682
01:08:02,246 --> 01:08:05,215
I was beginning to
think you were mad at me.

683
01:08:08,051 --> 01:08:10,320
So what's her name?

684
01:08:11,020 --> 01:08:13,223
Your bitch?

685
01:08:13,557 --> 01:08:15,625
Fuck you!

686
01:08:21,698 --> 01:08:24,601
Why did you get married if
you're gay?

687
01:08:26,370 --> 01:08:29,038
You have no clue about
our relationship.

688
01:08:29,173 --> 01:08:30,640
You're GAY!

689
01:08:31,175 --> 01:08:33,343
You can't make that go away.

690
01:08:34,010 --> 01:08:40,184
Alright, YES! I'm gay! Okay,
there. I said it. I'm gay.

691
01:08:42,018 --> 01:08:44,188
Does she even know?

692
01:08:48,592 --> 01:08:50,527
I don't know.

693
01:08:51,361 --> 01:08:53,797
Why did you marry her?

694
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,703
Because I thought it would
change.

695
01:09:01,871 --> 01:09:05,275
I thought having a baby would
make things different.

696
01:09:07,344 --> 01:09:10,113
Do you hear how ridiculous
that is?

697
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:13,550
Oh, it's so easy for
you, isn't it?

698
01:09:15,219 --> 01:09:17,821
We grew up in different times,
Cay.

699
01:09:18,154 --> 01:09:21,491
You... you have things like
fucking Glee.

700
01:09:22,892 --> 01:09:25,262
Where I grew up, all I heard

701
01:09:25,362 --> 01:09:27,964
Is that gay equals AIDS.

702
01:09:28,365 --> 01:09:30,434
You're gay, you die.

703
01:09:31,868 --> 01:09:33,470
That kept me hiding.

704
01:09:33,537 --> 01:09:35,372
You wanna know the real
reason my

705
01:09:35,372 --> 01:09:37,407
Adopted mother threw
her husband out?

706
01:09:37,941 --> 01:09:40,009
She caught him fucking me!

707
01:09:40,377 --> 01:09:42,712
He'd been molesting me for
years. You have no idea what it

708
01:09:42,712 --> 01:09:46,182
Feels like to have the man that
supposed to be your father...

709
01:09:47,251 --> 01:09:48,952
Ripping your ass open.

710
01:09:50,153 --> 01:09:53,357
And AIDS? You think I wasn't
scared of dying?

711
01:09:53,357 --> 01:09:57,661
That disgusting creeper shot
his load in my ass constantly.

712
01:09:59,396 --> 01:10:01,565
If you think I wasn't scared of
dying,

713
01:10:02,165 --> 01:10:04,568
Think again, my friend.

714
01:10:17,581 --> 01:10:18,982
Okay...

715
01:10:55,184 --> 01:10:57,387
I should be back by three.

716
01:10:57,721 --> 01:11:00,524
Would you like me to
leave the TV on for you?

717
01:11:02,459 --> 01:11:05,562
The TV... There's no TV.

718
01:11:07,664 --> 01:11:11,768
Okay, before I go... take three
of these.

719
01:11:12,936 --> 01:11:16,540
One, two, and three.

720
01:11:17,941 --> 01:11:20,777
Drink. Drink!

721
01:11:22,078 --> 01:11:23,913
Swallow.

722
01:11:24,448 --> 01:11:26,950
Now I know you know how
do to that.

723
01:11:28,017 --> 01:11:29,919
Good boy.

724
01:11:31,455 --> 01:11:33,757
Open. Come on, open.

725
01:11:34,023 --> 01:11:38,061
Come on...
For the anxiety.

726
01:11:40,096 --> 01:11:42,432
Three should do the trick.

727
01:11:42,866 --> 01:11:45,935
I wanna go home.

728
01:11:48,872 --> 01:11:51,408
You are home.

729
01:11:58,948 --> 01:12:00,817
I love you.

730
01:12:28,878 --> 01:12:32,416
(Phone Ringing)

731
01:13:40,383 --> 01:13:42,919
(Wimpering)

732
01:14:04,373 --> 01:14:06,209
Hey.

733
01:14:07,644 --> 01:14:10,213
Can I get one of these?

734
01:14:20,356 --> 01:14:22,526
I've seen you here.

735
01:14:22,592 --> 01:14:24,494
Because I work here.

736
01:14:24,494 --> 01:14:28,832
So listen. I'm hot. I think
you're kind of hot.

737
01:14:29,232 --> 01:14:30,934
What do you say we
make it happen?

738
01:14:32,068 --> 01:14:37,974
That's stupid. You're stupid.
Plus, I'm married.

739
01:14:38,742 --> 01:14:41,578
Yeah, well, good luck with
that.

740
01:14:43,112 --> 01:14:45,615
It's on the house.

741
01:14:45,749 --> 01:14:48,151
You're a nasty little bitch,
aren't you?

742
01:14:49,953 --> 01:14:52,556
You have no idea.

743
01:15:19,415 --> 01:15:21,017
Get up!

744
01:15:21,050 --> 01:15:24,153
AHHHHHHH!

745
01:15:24,220 --> 01:15:27,691
Come on. Shut up, you pussy.

746
01:15:28,157 --> 01:15:32,896
AHHHHHHH!

747
01:16:12,235 --> 01:16:16,072
I hope for your sake you
swallowed those pills.

748
01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:41,044
What the... what the fuck are
you doing?

749
01:19:41,344 --> 01:19:45,448
Get... what the fuck are you
doing?

750
01:19:48,584 --> 01:19:51,454
I thought you'd like it daddy.

751
01:20:00,997 --> 01:20:04,267
Please just kill me.

752
01:20:04,733 --> 01:20:08,104
I don't want this anymore.

753
01:20:10,373 --> 01:20:12,475
Don't be ridiculous.

754
01:20:13,042 --> 01:20:17,580
I wanna die. I can't...

755
01:20:18,948 --> 01:20:22,986
Don't worry. I have something
better for you.

756
01:20:34,864 --> 01:20:36,299
You're about to lose the one

757
01:20:36,299 --> 01:20:38,101
Thing that you worked
so hard for.

758
01:20:39,735 --> 01:20:41,905
Take a sip.

759
01:20:51,480 --> 01:20:53,549
Little more?

760
01:21:04,460 --> 01:21:06,462
It's good, isn't it?

761
01:21:06,963 --> 01:21:09,198
Have some more.

762
01:21:10,333 --> 01:21:14,170
Oh, come on, don't be greedy.
Let's get drunk together.

763
01:21:46,602 --> 01:21:49,072
Do you hate me?

764
01:21:50,106 --> 01:21:54,343
No. No I don't hate you.

765
01:21:56,379 --> 01:21:58,948
I am the one that you should
hate.

766
01:21:59,215 --> 01:22:01,484
This is all my fault.

767
01:22:02,785 --> 01:22:05,354
This isn't anyone's fault.

768
01:22:07,323 --> 01:22:09,058
I did this.

769
01:22:18,867 --> 01:22:21,404
You're not gonna
leave me now, are you?

770
01:22:21,770 --> 01:22:24,040
I said I love you.

771
01:22:26,375 --> 01:22:30,146
The past 8 months have changed
my life more than

772
01:22:30,146 --> 01:22:32,081
You will ever know.

773
01:22:37,553 --> 01:22:39,255
I'm sorry.

774
01:22:40,556 --> 01:22:42,691
I never want to leave you.

775
01:22:55,671 --> 01:22:58,107
Even though I'm really scared...

776
01:23:00,576 --> 01:23:02,711
I do love you.

777
01:23:11,887 --> 01:23:14,490
I'm so sorry, baby.

778
01:23:25,768 --> 01:23:27,503
NO!!!!

779
01:23:40,949 --> 01:23:43,986
AHHHH!!! GET IT OUT!

780
01:23:43,986 --> 01:23:47,623
GET IT OUT!!!!

781
01:24:05,341 --> 01:24:08,244
There was only one thing left
to do.

782
01:24:09,112 --> 01:24:11,414
And what was that?

783
01:24:38,841 --> 01:24:40,443
(Phone Vibrates)

784
01:25:12,441 --> 01:25:16,579
You do and say exactly what
we went over, okay?

785
01:25:18,681 --> 01:25:19,748
Yes.

786
01:25:21,150 --> 01:25:24,420
Everything will be okay.

787
01:25:42,305 --> 01:25:46,141
Jeremy? Jeremy, I'm here.

788
01:25:47,610 --> 01:25:48,844
Leah...

789
01:26:05,494 --> 01:26:07,162
Jeremy?

790
01:26:10,266 --> 01:26:12,368
What's this all about?

791
01:26:12,501 --> 01:26:13,869
Jeremy!!!

792
01:26:15,838 --> 01:26:16,572
Are you okay?

793
01:26:16,639 --> 01:26:18,874
Seems we have something
in common.

794
01:26:22,445 --> 01:26:24,880
Isn't that right, baby?

795
01:26:26,315 --> 01:26:29,552
Somebody tell me what
the hell is going on here!

796
01:26:30,219 --> 01:26:32,688
Go on... tell her.

797
01:26:32,788 --> 01:26:34,823
Please... help me.

798
01:26:37,993 --> 01:26:39,728
Come on.

799
01:26:40,363 --> 01:26:42,765
Go ahead and tell her.

800
01:26:44,400 --> 01:26:46,602
Just like we practiced.

801
01:26:50,706 --> 01:26:52,941
Come on. I...

802
01:26:53,542 --> 01:26:54,577
I...

803
01:26:55,611 --> 01:26:56,779
Am...

804
01:26:58,781 --> 01:27:00,416
Am...

805
01:27:00,716 --> 01:27:01,584
A...

806
01:27:02,285 --> 01:27:03,986
Please...

807
01:27:06,221 --> 01:27:07,923
- A...
- A...

808
01:27:09,592 --> 01:27:11,460
Faggot.

809
01:27:12,127 --> 01:27:13,696
Faggot.

810
01:27:14,430 --> 01:27:18,901
How are we supposed to be a
family when you have a wife?

811
01:27:21,236 --> 01:27:23,539
We've been fucking for
almost a year.

812
01:27:23,606 --> 01:27:25,741
Tell her how you like to go
down on me.

813
01:27:25,741 --> 01:27:28,311
He sucks a mean cock.
Swallows, too.

814
01:27:31,213 --> 01:27:34,417
Nice throw. You're more of a
man then he is.

815
01:27:36,985 --> 01:27:40,856
Wouldn't it be great if mommy
had a dirty little secret, too?

816
01:27:42,190 --> 01:27:47,563
Cay, it's over.

817
01:27:51,133 --> 01:27:53,369
Stop! Stop!

818
01:27:55,170 --> 01:27:58,774
You wanna fuck with
my family!

819
01:28:30,739 --> 01:28:32,708
I killed her.

820
01:28:34,810 --> 01:28:36,745
I did it.

821
01:28:39,848 --> 01:28:42,485
I didn't mean to do it.

822
01:28:43,419 --> 01:28:45,921
I didn't mean to hurt anyone.

823
01:28:46,154 --> 01:28:50,125
It's the last thing I remember,
was being at Jeremy's house.

824
01:28:50,459 --> 01:28:52,861
And that was it.

825
01:29:00,369 --> 01:29:02,170
Like I said...

826
01:29:02,438 --> 01:29:05,641
Let's start at the beginning.

827
01:29:19,187 --> 01:29:20,723
Are you hungry still?

828
01:29:20,723 --> 01:29:23,592
Are you hungry still? You
wanna play with the cow?

829
01:29:23,859 --> 01:29:28,431
You want your little cow? I
know you do.

830
01:29:28,497 --> 01:29:32,267
I know mamma. Don't you cry.
You wanna eat.

831
01:29:32,334 --> 01:29:36,138
I know you do. I know you do.

832
01:29:36,505 --> 01:29:40,809
I got your feet. I know mamma.

833
01:29:42,244 --> 01:29:43,912
Jeremy?
