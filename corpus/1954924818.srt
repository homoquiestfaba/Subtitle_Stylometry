1
00:00:18,684 --> 00:00:22,253
- Honey, You Gonna Be In There All Night?
- I'Ll Be Right Out.

2
00:00:31,562 --> 00:00:33,596
I Can'T Believe
There'S No Television.

3
00:00:33,598 --> 00:00:36,165
Oh, Don'T Be
Such A Grump.

4
00:00:36,167 --> 00:00:38,567
I Think It'S Quaint.

5
00:00:38,569 --> 00:00:40,702
Hey, Aren'T We
On The Top Floor?

6
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:43,037
- Yeah, I Think.
- That'S What I Thought.

7
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:44,671
It'S Just That
When I Was In The Bathroom,

8
00:00:44,673 --> 00:00:47,707
I Heard This, Like,
Weird Creaking Noise.

9
00:00:47,709 --> 00:00:50,242
It'S An Old House.

10
00:00:51,177 --> 00:00:53,211
You'Re Right.

11
00:00:53,213 --> 00:00:55,213
Mmm!

12
00:00:55,215 --> 00:00:57,048
So, You Want To Go
Antiquing Tomorrow?

13
00:00:57,050 --> 00:00:58,616
No, I Want To Go To
The Witch Museum.

14
00:00:58,618 --> 00:01:01,118
The Witch Museum? Everyone
Goes To The Witch Museum.

15
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,453
I Know,
But When In Rome...

16
00:01:03,455 --> 00:01:06,355
All Right, Witch
Museum It Is.

17
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:08,256
Thank You.

18
00:01:08,258 --> 00:01:10,791
Anything
For My Baby.

19
00:01:10,793 --> 00:01:12,492
But Now We Have
To Go To Sleep,

20
00:01:12,494 --> 00:01:14,460
'Cause We Have To
Get Up Early.

21
00:01:14,462 --> 00:01:16,795
Okay.

22
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,434
- Good Night.
- Good Night.

23
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,374
Dan, I See
You Found The Place.

24
00:03:45,376 --> 00:03:47,809
Yes, And I Did Not
Get Lost This Time.

25
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:50,678
Gretchen, This Is
My Wife, Jessica.
Jessica, This Is Gretchen.

26
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,313
- Nice To Finally
Meet You.
- Hi.

27
00:03:58,252 --> 00:04:00,353
This Is My Aunt Rose.
She'S The Current Owner.

28
00:04:00,355 --> 00:04:02,521
Rose, This Is Dan
And Jessica Coffey.

29
00:04:02,523 --> 00:04:04,856
They'Re Here To
See The House.

30
00:04:04,858 --> 00:04:06,958
Hi. Your House
Is Lovely.

31
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,393
You'Ll Have To
Excuse My Aunt.

32
00:04:09,395 --> 00:04:12,629
This Is Very Hard For Her--
Handing Over The Business
To Strangers.

33
00:04:12,631 --> 00:04:16,499
- I'M Sure
You Understand.
- Of Course.

34
00:04:19,469 --> 00:04:22,370
The House Is Over
350 Years Old.

35
00:04:22,372 --> 00:04:26,540
It'S One Of The Oldest
In All Of New England,

36
00:04:26,542 --> 00:04:30,276
Dating Back To
The Early Colonists.

37
00:04:31,611 --> 00:04:34,379
It Needs Some Updating,

38
00:04:34,381 --> 00:04:36,781
But That'S Part
Of The Charm.

39
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:54,763
Wow.

40
00:05:02,404 --> 00:05:03,771
Great View.

41
00:05:03,773 --> 00:05:05,605
Absolutely.

42
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:10,676
- It'S Nice, Right?
- Yeah.

43
00:05:10,678 --> 00:05:13,011
We Have
A Main Residence

44
00:05:13,013 --> 00:05:15,747
And Then Three Guest Rooms,
All Upstairs.

45
00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:18,649
- How Long Has It Been
A Bed-And-Breakfast?
- 40 Years.

46
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:21,284
My Aunt And Uncle
Converted It When
They First Bought It.

47
00:05:21,286 --> 00:05:24,020
If You Don'T Mind Me Asking,
Why Are You Guys
Selling The Place?

48
00:05:24,022 --> 00:05:26,789
He Died About A Year Ago,
A Heart Attack.
It Was Very Sudden.

49
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:28,957
She Tried To Keep The Place
Going On Her Own,

50
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:31,025
But It Was Just
Too Much For Her.

51
00:05:31,027 --> 00:05:33,794
Did They Not Have A
Handyman Or Any Other Staff?

52
00:05:33,796 --> 00:05:35,829
No, It Was Just
The Two Of Them.

53
00:05:35,831 --> 00:05:37,831
My Uncle Was
The Fix-It Type.

54
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:40,834
Liked To Do Things
Himself.

55
00:05:40,836 --> 00:05:43,636
So, What'S Gonna
Happen To Her?

56
00:05:43,638 --> 00:05:45,604
Assisted Living.

57
00:05:45,606 --> 00:05:48,740
We Found A Lovely Place
Just A Few Miles From Here.

58
00:05:48,742 --> 00:05:51,976
I Have To Warn You,
The Upstairs Is
A Bit Of A Mess.

59
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:14,764
So What About All
This Furniture Here?

60
00:06:14,766 --> 00:06:16,999
What Do You Guys Plan
On Doing With It?

61
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:19,568
It'S Included. It'D Be
Too Much Trouble To Move It.

62
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:22,904
And Besides,
It Belongs To The House.

63
00:06:32,914 --> 00:06:34,981
So, What
Do You Think?

64
00:06:34,983 --> 00:06:38,584
Can We Afford This?

65
00:06:38,586 --> 00:06:40,886
Yes. We'Ll Be...
We'Ll Be Fine.

66
00:06:40,888 --> 00:06:42,888
- Are You...
- I Promise.

67
00:06:44,056 --> 00:06:46,891
Okay.
Let'S Do It.

68
00:06:46,893 --> 00:06:48,859
- Really?
- Yeah,

69
00:06:48,861 --> 00:06:51,962
- If You Think
We Can Do This.
- I Know We Can.

70
00:06:51,964 --> 00:06:54,631
Okay.

71
00:06:54,633 --> 00:06:56,532
- I Love You.
- I Love You, Too.

72
00:06:56,534 --> 00:06:58,901
This Is Gonna
Be Great.

73
00:06:58,903 --> 00:07:02,571
Okay. Well, I'Ll Go
Back To The Office
And Draw Up The Paperwork.

74
00:07:02,573 --> 00:07:04,005
Pleasure Doing
Business With You.

75
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:05,706
Absolutely.
Thank You Very Much.

76
00:07:05,708 --> 00:07:07,974
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

77
00:07:09,476 --> 00:07:11,710
I Know Running
A B & B Is Crazy,

78
00:07:11,712 --> 00:07:15,480
But It'S Been Your
Dream Since As Long
As I'Ve Known You.

79
00:07:15,482 --> 00:07:18,449
I Know. I Just...

80
00:07:18,451 --> 00:07:21,518
Well, I Guess
It'S Our Dream Now.

81
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,786
I Am Completely
Okay With That.

82
00:07:25,822 --> 00:07:27,756
- Okay.
- Next Time We
Drive Up Here,

83
00:07:27,758 --> 00:07:29,591
It'S Gonna Be
Our Home.

84
00:07:56,451 --> 00:07:58,652
Honey, Where Does
This One Go?

85
00:07:58,654 --> 00:08:00,787
Uh, The Kitchen.

86
00:08:00,789 --> 00:08:04,457
Kitchen. Okay.
Wylie, Come On, Boy.

87
00:08:08,829 --> 00:08:11,931
Excellent.

88
00:08:11,933 --> 00:08:15,668
Honey, I Got
The Phone Working.

89
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:17,870
You Want A
Gold Star Or Something?

90
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:21,006
Yes, Actually, I Would
Love A Gold Star.
Thank You.

91
00:08:21,008 --> 00:08:23,942
All Right, Well,
Why Don'T You Order Us
Some Food On That Thing?

92
00:08:23,944 --> 00:08:25,810
I'M Starving.

93
00:08:32,684 --> 00:08:34,785
- How Is It?
- Okay.

94
00:08:34,787 --> 00:08:36,019
- Yeah?
- Mm-Hmm.

95
00:08:36,021 --> 00:08:38,521
Oh.

96
00:08:38,523 --> 00:08:39,855
Mm. Mm-Hmm.

97
00:08:39,857 --> 00:08:41,489
Did We Unpack
The Glasses?

98
00:08:41,491 --> 00:08:43,123
Hm-Mmm.
Not Yet.

99
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:45,158
Okay.

100
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,895
This Is Gonna
Have To Do,

101
00:08:49,897 --> 00:08:51,729
Madame.

102
00:08:56,201 --> 00:08:57,867
Okay.

103
00:09:08,912 --> 00:09:11,078
A Toast

104
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:14,081
To Our New Home
And Business.

105
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:16,216
Look At Us.

106
00:09:16,218 --> 00:09:18,518
So Classy.

107
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,786
Okay, Well, Mine'S...
Do You Want To Know
My Lucky Numbers?

108
00:09:20,788 --> 00:09:24,990
- Yes. No. I Want To
Read You My Thing.
- What Are Yours?

109
00:09:24,992 --> 00:09:28,059
"Keep In Mind Your
Most Cherished Dreams

110
00:09:28,061 --> 00:09:29,994
In The Future."

111
00:09:29,996 --> 00:09:31,929
- Oh, That'S
What We'Re Doing.
- Yes.

112
00:09:31,931 --> 00:09:34,598
And, Um, "To Catch A Cold"
Is

113
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,701
- Huh?
- Exactly.

114
00:09:47,611 --> 00:09:49,745
Hey, Honey?

115
00:09:49,747 --> 00:09:51,980
What Time Do You
Want To Wake Up
Tomorrow Morning?

116
00:09:51,982 --> 00:09:53,948
Mm, Early.

117
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:55,783
Like, 6:00 A.M.

118
00:09:55,785 --> 00:09:57,151
Okay.

119
00:09:58,153 --> 00:09:59,887
Excellent.

120
00:09:59,889 --> 00:10:01,855
We'Ll Have
Breakfast In Bed.

121
00:10:01,857 --> 00:10:03,590
What Do You Want,
Pancakes Or Waffles?

122
00:10:03,592 --> 00:10:05,091
Pancakes.

123
00:10:11,731 --> 00:10:13,765
I'M So Tired.

124
00:10:13,767 --> 00:10:16,200
Yeah? Long Day?

125
00:10:16,202 --> 00:10:18,769
- Yeah.

126
00:10:18,771 --> 00:10:21,304
Hmm. Mm.

127
00:10:21,306 --> 00:10:23,205
- What?
- What?

128
00:10:23,207 --> 00:10:25,941
I'M Just Checking Out
My Gorgeous Wife'S

129
00:10:25,943 --> 00:10:28,643
Incredibly Cute Ass.

130
00:10:39,754 --> 00:10:41,588
Can We Do This
Tomorrow?

131
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:43,890
Tomorrow?

132
00:10:43,892 --> 00:10:46,325
- Don'T You Know
The Rules?
- What?

133
00:10:46,327 --> 00:10:49,661
You Have To Christen
Your New House
In Your New Bed,

134
00:10:49,663 --> 00:10:52,063
Or It'S Incredibly
Bad Luck.

135
00:10:53,765 --> 00:10:56,566
- Rain Check?
-           "Rain Check"?

136
00:10:56,568 --> 00:10:58,701
Yeah,
I'M Tired.

137
00:10:58,703 --> 00:11:00,869
Did You Pull
That Card On Me?

138
00:11:05,207 --> 00:11:07,208
Okay, But Remind Me

139
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:09,777
To Oil The New Bed

140
00:11:09,779 --> 00:11:11,645
For The Rain Check.

141
00:11:14,081 --> 00:11:17,249
- Sweaty Dreams, Baby.
- "Sw-- Sweaty Dreams"?

142
00:11:17,251 --> 00:11:18,950
Yes.

143
00:11:18,952 --> 00:11:20,785
You Are Cruel.

144
00:11:20,787 --> 00:11:23,220
- You Love Me.
- Yes, I Do.

145
00:11:51,749 --> 00:11:53,616
- Hi.
- Hi.

146
00:11:57,053 --> 00:11:59,888
I Forgot Where I Was
This Morning.

147
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:02,757
Don'T Worry About It.
It'Ll Take Some
Getting Used To.

148
00:12:07,663 --> 00:12:10,864
So What'S First
On The Agenda?

149
00:12:10,866 --> 00:12:12,765
Got Anything?

150
00:12:12,767 --> 00:12:14,633
No.

151
00:12:15,668 --> 00:12:18,302
All Right. Um...

152
00:12:18,304 --> 00:12:20,238
How About That One?

153
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,473
Uh, No.

154
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:25,108
All Right, Then.

155
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:26,776
What About That One?

156
00:12:26,778 --> 00:12:28,511
Oh, Yep.
That'S The Kitchen.

157
00:12:28,513 --> 00:12:32,414
That... Is The Kitchen.
All Right.

158
00:12:38,889 --> 00:12:41,022
This One Is

159
00:12:41,024 --> 00:12:43,057
A Bit Of A Mystery.

160
00:12:46,494 --> 00:12:48,461
Okay, So I'M All Done.

161
00:12:48,463 --> 00:12:51,430
Cool. Can You Help Me
With Some Of These Boxes?

162
00:12:51,432 --> 00:12:53,965
- Maybe.
- Come On.

163
00:13:30,867 --> 00:13:33,368
Dan?

164
00:13:37,473 --> 00:13:39,540
Are You Down Here?

165
00:13:45,313 --> 00:13:47,113
Babe?

166
00:13:48,315 --> 00:13:50,282
Oh, Hey.

167
00:13:52,285 --> 00:13:54,953
What Is All This?

168
00:13:54,955 --> 00:13:56,554
Uh, I Don'T Know.

169
00:13:56,556 --> 00:14:00,324
Some Kind Of Storeroom,
I Guess.

170
00:14:00,326 --> 00:14:02,159
Oh.

171
00:14:03,995 --> 00:14:07,397
- Oh, Weird.
Look At This Chair.
- I Know.

172
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:09,899
At Least, I Think
It'S A Chair.
What Is That?

173
00:14:09,901 --> 00:14:12,334
I Don'T Know,
But I Wouldn'T Go
Touching It If I Were You.

174
00:14:12,336 --> 00:14:14,402
That'S Pretty Nasty.

175
00:14:16,204 --> 00:14:18,604
Why Does It Have
Straps On It?

176
00:14:21,407 --> 00:14:24,075
I Don'T Know.
You Tell Me.

177
00:14:24,077 --> 00:14:26,377
I Don'T Know Why
There'S A Strap On It.

178
00:14:26,379 --> 00:14:28,479
I Don'T Know.

179
00:14:30,014 --> 00:14:31,914
You'Re The Smart One.

180
00:14:46,294 --> 00:14:48,495
So Much For
That Rain Check.

181
00:15:01,976 --> 00:15:04,577
Good Night, Hot Stuff.

182
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:42,140
I Have To Feed Them.

183
00:15:49,647 --> 00:15:53,282
I'M Waiting For You.

184
00:15:53,284 --> 00:15:56,151
Dan! Dan. Dan.

185
00:15:56,153 --> 00:15:58,019
Dan, Wake Up!

186
00:16:02,123 --> 00:16:05,125
Oh, Dear.
I Woke You.

187
00:16:09,096 --> 00:16:12,498
No, I-I Don'T Know
How She Got In.

188
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:16,435
That'S The Point.
We Woke Up, And She Was
In Our Bedroom.

189
00:16:16,437 --> 00:16:19,037
- Yeah, Okay.
No, No, No, No, No.

190
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:20,238
- What?
- I'Ll Call Them.

191
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,405
The Children.

192
00:16:21,407 --> 00:16:23,540
Take Care
Of The Children.

193
00:16:35,085 --> 00:16:38,120
My Norman.

194
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:42,023
My Sweet,
Sweet Norman.

195
00:16:46,962 --> 00:16:49,263
This Way, Mrs. Stanton.

196
00:16:49,265 --> 00:16:51,398
Such A Nice Girl.

197
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:54,167
- Too Bad.
- I'M Very Sorry
About This.

198
00:16:54,169 --> 00:16:57,136
Apparently,
She Just Walked Out.

199
00:16:57,138 --> 00:16:58,604
So She Made It
All The Way Here.

200
00:16:58,606 --> 00:17:01,039
Well, This Is
What She Knows.

201
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:02,707
This Place,
It'S What
She Remembers.

202
00:17:02,709 --> 00:17:05,176
She Must'Ve Walked
Through The Woods.

203
00:17:05,178 --> 00:17:09,413
Without Any Shoes?
How Far Is That?

204
00:17:09,415 --> 00:17:11,982
Um, They Always
Kept A Spare
Hidden Outside.

205
00:17:11,984 --> 00:17:14,184
That'S How
She Got In.

206
00:17:14,186 --> 00:17:16,219
You Might Want To
Change The Locks,

207
00:17:16,221 --> 00:17:17,620
All The Same.

208
00:17:17,622 --> 00:17:21,056
Gretchen Said She Didn'T
Even Have Any Kids.

209
00:17:21,058 --> 00:17:24,192
That Just Doesn'T Make
Any Sense. Then What Was
She Talking About?

210
00:17:24,194 --> 00:17:26,260
Babe, She'S Confused.

211
00:17:26,262 --> 00:17:28,695
She'S Old.

212
00:17:28,697 --> 00:17:32,131
I Don'T Know. I Feel Like We'Re
Somehow Taking Advantage Of
Her Or Something.

213
00:17:32,133 --> 00:17:34,299
Are You Kidding Me?
You Saw Her.

214
00:17:34,301 --> 00:17:36,634
She Didn'T Even Know
Where She Was.

215
00:17:36,636 --> 00:17:38,736
If It Wasn'T Us That Came
And Snatched Up This Place,

216
00:17:38,738 --> 00:17:40,504
It Would'Ve Been
Somebody Else.

217
00:17:40,506 --> 00:17:42,572
At Least
We'Re Good People.

218
00:17:48,677 --> 00:17:50,678
Give Me One Sec.

219
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,346
Okay.

220
00:17:53,548 --> 00:17:55,282
Hello?

221
00:18:03,156 --> 00:18:06,191
So That Was Roger.

222
00:18:06,193 --> 00:18:09,060
He Wants Me To
Fly Out To Chicago.

223
00:18:09,062 --> 00:18:12,596
But I Thought I Had You
For The Next Week.

224
00:18:12,598 --> 00:18:15,732
I'M Sorry. Apparently
There'S Some Client
I'M Supposed To Meet.

225
00:18:15,734 --> 00:18:17,600
It'S Really Important.

226
00:18:19,202 --> 00:18:21,203
Okay.

227
00:18:22,438 --> 00:18:24,238
Sorry.

228
00:18:26,174 --> 00:18:29,075
Hey, Babe,
I'M Heading Into Town
For Some Supplies.

229
00:18:29,077 --> 00:18:32,078
- You Need Anything?
- Nope. I'M Good.

230
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:36,182
- Okay. I Guess
I'Ll See You In A Bit.
- All Right.

231
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,818
Where Did You Get
That Weirdo Book?

232
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:16,520
It'S Not A Weirdo Book.

233
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:18,755
I Got It
At The Library.

234
00:19:18,757 --> 00:19:20,590
You Know,

235
00:19:20,592 --> 00:19:23,392
That Big Building
In Town

236
00:19:23,394 --> 00:19:25,360
With All The Books
In It.

237
00:19:25,362 --> 00:19:27,395
Right, Right, Right.
That Place

238
00:19:27,397 --> 00:19:30,331
With The Words
On Paper.

239
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:32,433
- Yeah.
- Oh.

240
00:19:33,635 --> 00:19:36,236
Anyway, So Why Are
You Reading It?

241
00:19:36,238 --> 00:19:38,271
I Don'T Know.

242
00:19:38,273 --> 00:19:40,506
Thought I'D Try
To Brush Up On
The Region'S History.

243
00:19:40,508 --> 00:19:43,375
- Mm.
- You Know,
Just In Case

244
00:19:43,377 --> 00:19:45,610
Our Guests Ask.

245
00:19:46,612 --> 00:19:48,412
That'S Very Smart.

246
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:52,782
Oh. Oh, Babe, Look,
It'S Our House.

247
00:19:52,784 --> 00:19:56,318
It Says Here That
The Man Who Built It
In 1665,

248
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,721
Arthur March,
Was A Carriage Maker.

249
00:19:59,723 --> 00:20:01,589
Hence The Name.

250
00:20:01,591 --> 00:20:04,358
That'S Clever.

251
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:07,694
- You Are Such A Dork!
- I Know.

252
00:20:10,264 --> 00:20:12,865
Oh, His Wife, Lydia,
Was A Midwife

253
00:20:12,867 --> 00:20:15,400
To The Early Colonists.

254
00:20:15,402 --> 00:20:17,402
Hmm.

255
00:20:17,404 --> 00:20:19,470
That'S Kind Of Cool.

256
00:20:21,706 --> 00:20:24,307
Oh, Babe,
Listen To This.
Look.

257
00:20:24,309 --> 00:20:26,309
"When A Mysterious
Illness

258
00:20:26,311 --> 00:20:28,311
"Plagued The Colony'S
Children,

259
00:20:28,313 --> 00:20:30,479
"Lydia Was Blamed
For It

260
00:20:30,481 --> 00:20:33,615
"And Accused Of
Practicing Witchcraft.

261
00:20:33,617 --> 00:20:37,584
She Was Tried
And Hanged In 1669."

262
00:20:38,819 --> 00:20:41,220
Can You
Believe That?

263
00:20:41,222 --> 00:20:43,755
Some Kids Get The Flu,
And Immediately It'S
A Woman'S Fault.

264
00:20:45,691 --> 00:20:47,425
What?

265
00:20:47,427 --> 00:20:49,794
Just, I Love
My Little Feminist.

266
00:20:49,796 --> 00:20:51,629
- Well...
- So Cute.

267
00:20:51,631 --> 00:20:54,465
Yeah, Just...
It'S A Little
Frustrating.

268
00:21:20,424 --> 00:21:22,458
- I Love You.
- I Love You.

269
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:24,660
- Hurry Back, Okay?
- I Will.

270
00:21:25,928 --> 00:21:28,562
Bye, Wylie.
See You Later.

271
00:23:07,826 --> 00:23:10,694
Wylie? Wylie?
You Want To Go For A Walk?

272
00:23:10,696 --> 00:23:14,030
All Right.
All Right.

273
00:23:14,032 --> 00:23:17,600
Come On! Come On!
Yeah!

274
00:23:46,029 --> 00:23:47,795
Wylie?

275
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:51,731
Wylie, Come On, Boy.

276
00:23:59,339 --> 00:24:00,871
Hey, What'S Up?

277
00:24:00,873 --> 00:24:02,873
- Is This Your Dog?
- Yeah.

278
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:05,041
What'S His Name?

279
00:24:05,043 --> 00:24:08,111
Wylie.

280
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:09,745
Hey, You'Re The New Owner
Of That Inn, Right?

281
00:24:09,747 --> 00:24:11,046
You Mean
The Carriage House?

282
00:24:11,048 --> 00:24:13,848
Yeah, The Old
Witch'S Place.

283
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:17,518
- You, Uh, Want One?
- Uh, No, Thanks.

284
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,521
I Don'T Smoke.

285
00:24:20,523 --> 00:24:22,656
Hey, Listen,
I'Ve Got To Get Back.

286
00:24:22,658 --> 00:24:24,758
My Husband'S Going To
Start To Worry.

287
00:24:26,761 --> 00:24:29,629
You Want To Let Go
Of My Dog?

288
00:24:29,631 --> 00:24:31,230
Sure Thing.

289
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:33,565
Thanks.

290
00:24:33,567 --> 00:24:34,999
Come On.

291
00:24:36,901 --> 00:24:39,102
See You Around.

292
00:24:49,145 --> 00:24:51,212
Wylie, Come On.

293
00:26:57,296 --> 00:26:59,597
Wylie, Come On.
Let'S Go To Bed.

294
00:27:33,631 --> 00:27:37,032
Wylie? Wylie.

295
00:27:37,034 --> 00:27:38,800
Hey, Come On.

296
00:27:38,802 --> 00:27:40,868
Wylie, Get Away
From There.

297
00:27:58,352 --> 00:27:59,885
Weird.

298
00:28:58,036 --> 00:28:59,836
Hello?

299
00:29:00,938 --> 00:29:03,339
Hello?

300
00:30:31,219 --> 00:30:35,455
<I> Are You Sure? </I>
- Yes, Dan, I'M Sure It Rang,

301
00:30:35,457 --> 00:30:38,157
But It Said
It Was Coming From
The East Room.

302
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:40,292
<I> That'S Weird. It'S Probably</I>
<I> Just Something Wrong</I>
<I> With The Wiring.</I>

303
00:30:40,294 --> 00:30:42,527
<I> I'Ll Check It</I>
<I> When I Get Home.</I>

304
00:30:42,529 --> 00:30:45,263
Okay, Yeah. I Guess
I'M Just Being Silly.

305
00:30:45,265 --> 00:30:49,100
<I> Hey, I Got To Go,</I>
<I> But I'Ll See You</I>
<I> Tomorrow, Okay?</I>

306
00:30:49,102 --> 00:30:52,536
Okay. Bye.

307
00:35:35,112 --> 00:35:36,744
Damn.

308
00:37:24,552 --> 00:37:26,953
Norman, You Dirty
Old Man.

309
00:38:03,453 --> 00:38:05,287
Jess?

310
00:38:22,503 --> 00:38:24,570
Sweetie,
You In There?

311
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:30,241
Honey?

312
00:38:30,243 --> 00:38:32,309
Hey, I'M Home.

313
00:38:37,348 --> 00:38:39,982
Hey, There.

314
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:42,317
You Want Some Company?

315
00:38:47,323 --> 00:38:49,724
No, No, No, No.
I Didn'T Want You
To Turn It Off.

316
00:38:49,726 --> 00:38:52,026
I Just Wanted
To Let You Know
I Was Home.

317
00:38:52,028 --> 00:38:54,294
Okay.

318
00:38:55,329 --> 00:38:58,431
Hey, Is Something Wrong?

319
00:38:58,433 --> 00:39:00,499
I'M Fine.

320
00:39:00,501 --> 00:39:02,767
I'M Fine.

321
00:39:02,769 --> 00:39:04,869
Okay.

322
00:39:19,016 --> 00:39:21,550
You Made Quite The Dent
Here Today, Babe.

323
00:39:21,552 --> 00:39:23,618
Yeah.

324
00:39:24,786 --> 00:39:26,920
I'Ve Been Busy.

325
00:39:26,922 --> 00:39:29,355
I Can See That.

326
00:39:32,459 --> 00:39:34,827
Tried Calling You.

327
00:39:34,829 --> 00:39:36,595
Oh?

328
00:39:38,431 --> 00:39:40,665
I Didn'T Hear
The Phone Ring.

329
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:43,967
I Was A Little Worried.

330
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:48,404
Hey,

331
00:39:48,406 --> 00:39:50,806
Is Everything Okay?

332
00:39:50,808 --> 00:39:52,674
Yeah.

333
00:39:53,742 --> 00:39:56,744
I'M Just Tired.

334
00:39:56,746 --> 00:39:59,079
I Haven'T Been
Sleeping Too Well.

335
00:40:03,717 --> 00:40:05,784
,i Missed You.

336
00:40:07,419 --> 00:40:09,486
I Missed You, Too.

337
00:41:02,005 --> 00:41:04,506
Hey.

338
00:41:04,508 --> 00:41:06,674
Where Were You?

339
00:41:07,776 --> 00:41:09,910
Bathroom.

340
00:41:09,912 --> 00:41:12,612
Mm.
You'Re So Cold.

341
00:41:40,138 --> 00:41:42,772
Smells Good.

342
00:41:52,081 --> 00:41:54,415
Wylie.
Hey, Buddy.

343
00:41:54,417 --> 00:41:56,517
You All Right?

344
00:41:56,519 --> 00:41:58,519
Hey, Is Something
Wrong With Him?

345
00:41:58,521 --> 00:42:00,621
He Looks Spooked.
Wylie.

346
00:42:00,623 --> 00:42:03,857
No, I Don'T Know.

347
00:42:03,859 --> 00:42:06,593
Honey...

348
00:42:06,595 --> 00:42:09,929
Have You Been
Beating Our Dog
While I'Ve Been Away?

349
00:42:09,931 --> 00:42:11,997
You Have, Right?

350
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:16,033
No, I Would Never
Do That.

351
00:42:17,435 --> 00:42:20,603
I'M Just Kidding,
Jesus.

352
00:42:20,605 --> 00:42:24,607
What'S... Were You Doing
A Little, Like, Gardening
Before Breakfast?

353
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:30,612
Oh, I Forgot
To Mention That

354
00:42:30,614 --> 00:42:33,248
There'S Something Wrong
With The Washing Machine.

355
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:35,316
It'S Flooded.

356
00:42:35,318 --> 00:42:37,584
Okay. I'Ll Take
A Look At It.

357
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:12,208
Hey, Jess, Have You
Seen My Hammer?

358
00:44:21,783 --> 00:44:23,817
Jess?

359
00:44:36,862 --> 00:44:39,230
Hey, Jess,
You In There?

360
00:44:39,232 --> 00:44:41,966
Jess?

361
00:44:41,968 --> 00:44:44,034
What The Hell
Is That Locked For?

362
00:45:00,183 --> 00:45:02,384
Um...
You Didn'T Hear Me

363
00:45:02,386 --> 00:45:04,452
A Few Minutes Ago,
Trying To Get In?

364
00:45:04,454 --> 00:45:07,154
- No.
- What Are You
Doing In There?

365
00:45:07,156 --> 00:45:08,922
Nothing.
Just Straightening Up.

366
00:45:08,924 --> 00:45:11,758
You'Re Straightening Up
With The Door Locked?

367
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:14,160
I Heard Whispering
In There.

368
00:45:14,162 --> 00:45:16,295
Babe, Who Are
You Talking To?

369
00:45:17,397 --> 00:45:19,464
No One.

370
00:46:24,193 --> 00:46:27,862
Think A Raccoon
Just Tried To
Jack Our Car.

371
00:46:27,864 --> 00:46:31,232
- Wylie?
-         Wylie, Come On.

372
00:46:31,234 --> 00:46:34,835
We'Re Going
Upstairs, Buddy.
Hey. Upstairs.

373
00:46:34,837 --> 00:46:37,470
Wylie, Come On.
Upstairs.

374
00:46:37,472 --> 00:46:40,205
Come On.

375
00:46:41,907 --> 00:46:43,974
Come On.

376
00:46:52,816 --> 00:46:55,450
So... I Was
Just Wondering,

377
00:46:55,452 --> 00:46:58,820
Um, What Happened
To Your Shirt.

378
00:46:58,822 --> 00:47:02,156
I Tore It
On A Nail.

379
00:47:02,158 --> 00:47:05,492
You... You Tore It
On A Nail, So You
Threw It Out?

380
00:47:05,494 --> 00:47:07,827
I Ended Up Using It
As A Rag.

381
00:47:07,829 --> 00:47:11,497
As A Rag?
You Loved That Shirt.

382
00:47:11,499 --> 00:47:15,133
- You Got It
On Our Honeymoon.
- It Got Old.

383
00:47:32,951 --> 00:47:36,386
Hey, It'S Me.

384
00:47:36,388 --> 00:47:39,088
I Mean, She'S Been Acting
A Little Weird Lately.

385
00:47:39,090 --> 00:47:41,156
Moody Or Something.

386
00:47:43,392 --> 00:47:46,160
Yeah, That'S
Very Funny. No.

387
00:47:46,162 --> 00:47:48,362
You Can... Yeah,
You Can Go Ahead
And Tell Her That,

388
00:47:48,364 --> 00:47:50,464
Because I'M Not Gonna.

389
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:55,367
Can You... Can You
Hang On A Second?

390
00:48:04,944 --> 00:48:07,611
Oh, You Have Got
To Be Kidding Me.

391
00:48:07,613 --> 00:48:10,947
Hey, Can I
Call You Back?

392
00:48:41,611 --> 00:48:43,979
Damn It!

393
00:49:09,138 --> 00:49:11,205
What The Hell?

394
00:49:21,448 --> 00:49:23,449
Oh, Jesus.

395
00:50:20,202 --> 00:50:22,970
"Live Feed"?

396
00:50:22,972 --> 00:50:25,138
Huh.

397
00:50:27,074 --> 00:50:28,441
My God.

398
00:50:28,443 --> 00:50:31,410
These Cameras Are
Still Working.

399
00:51:47,684 --> 00:51:50,652
What The Hell?

400
00:52:07,702 --> 00:52:10,203
Oh, Hey.
You'Re Awake.

401
00:52:10,205 --> 00:52:13,672
Uh, I'M Gonna Run To
The Store, And I'Ve
Got To Fix The Roof.

402
00:52:14,674 --> 00:52:16,608
You Gonna Be Okay?

403
00:52:19,211 --> 00:52:20,744
I'M Fine.

404
00:52:23,414 --> 00:52:26,816
Okay.
All Right, See You.

405
00:52:52,741 --> 00:52:54,608
You Sure
About This?

406
00:52:54,610 --> 00:52:56,476
The Suv Is Gone.
I Saw Him Pull Out.

407
00:52:56,478 --> 00:52:58,845
What About
The Dog?

408
00:52:58,847 --> 00:53:00,679
Really, Dude?

409
00:53:03,582 --> 00:53:05,649
Keep A Lookout.

410
00:53:24,468 --> 00:53:26,435
Stay Here.

411
00:54:04,906 --> 00:54:06,706
Dylan?

412
00:55:20,279 --> 00:55:21,946
Dylan?

413
00:55:23,014 --> 00:55:24,914
Eric?

414
00:55:27,384 --> 00:55:29,685
Come On, Guys,
This Isn'T Funny.

415
00:55:37,725 --> 00:55:41,494
They'Re Still Here.

416
00:56:41,482 --> 00:56:44,083
Hey, Honey,
Just Want To Let You
Know I'M Home.

417
00:57:52,651 --> 00:57:54,885
What Do We Have Here?

418
00:57:59,991 --> 00:58:02,926
Unbelievable.

419
00:59:04,954 --> 00:59:07,956
"October 27th, 1998."

420
00:59:28,677 --> 00:59:32,513
"October 27th, 1998."

421
01:00:12,286 --> 01:00:14,053
What'S The Matter?

422
01:00:22,294 --> 01:00:24,795
What Do You Think About

423
01:00:24,797 --> 01:00:27,631
- Getting Out Of Here
For A Few Days?
- When?

424
01:00:27,633 --> 01:00:30,867
I Don'T Know.
How About Tomorrow?

425
01:00:30,869 --> 01:00:33,636
We Still Have
A Lot Of Stuff
Left To Do Here.

426
01:00:33,638 --> 01:00:36,805
I Know, And We'Ve Been
Working Really Hard,
Especially You,

427
01:00:36,807 --> 01:00:38,940
With The Unpacking
And The Renovations.

428
01:00:38,942 --> 01:00:40,975
I Just Think
It Would Be Cool

429
01:00:40,977 --> 01:00:43,610
If We Just Took Off

430
01:00:43,612 --> 01:00:45,979
And, Uh, Cleared
Our Heads.

431
01:00:45,981 --> 01:00:48,247
I Just Think
You'Ve Been Working
Really Hard,

432
01:00:48,249 --> 01:00:50,816
And You Deserve...

433
01:00:50,818 --> 01:00:53,952
I'M Not Going Anywhere
Until We'Re Finished Here.

434
01:02:56,103 --> 01:02:58,270
Dan?

435
01:02:58,272 --> 01:03:00,138
Where Have You Been?

436
01:03:00,140 --> 01:03:02,306
On A Walk.

437
01:03:02,308 --> 01:03:05,409
Did You Sleep In Here
Last Night?

438
01:03:05,411 --> 01:03:07,077
You Were Snoring.

439
01:03:07,079 --> 01:03:10,080
What... What'S
The Matter With You?

440
01:03:10,082 --> 01:03:11,881
Nothing.

441
01:03:11,883 --> 01:03:15,117
Look, I Don'T Know
What I Did

442
01:03:15,119 --> 01:03:19,020
To Make You So Mad
And Distant.

443
01:03:19,022 --> 01:03:21,255
Okay, Maybe It Was
My Trip To Chicago

444
01:03:21,257 --> 01:03:24,391
When I Was Supposed
To Be Here For You,
I Don'T Know.

445
01:03:24,393 --> 01:03:26,926
I'M Not Mad.

446
01:04:04,363 --> 01:04:07,031
"Record."

447
01:04:48,472 --> 01:04:50,372
Hi. Mrs. Stanton?

448
01:04:50,374 --> 01:04:52,173
If You Can Just
Sign In Here,

449
01:04:52,175 --> 01:04:54,542
And She'S In Room 119,
On The Left.

450
01:05:00,581 --> 01:05:04,517
Mrs. Stanton,
Do You Remember Me?

451
01:05:04,519 --> 01:05:06,986
Uh...

452
01:05:06,988 --> 01:05:10,922
My Wife And I, We Bought
The Carriage House.

453
01:05:12,958 --> 01:05:15,326
We'Re The New Owners.

454
01:05:20,231 --> 01:05:23,566
Uh, Mrs. Stanton,
The Other Night

455
01:05:23,568 --> 01:05:26,402
You Mentioned
Something To My Wife

456
01:05:26,404 --> 01:05:29,138
About The Children.

457
01:05:29,140 --> 01:05:31,507
Did I?

458
01:05:33,042 --> 01:05:35,376
You Don'T...
You Don'T Remember That?

459
01:05:39,947 --> 01:05:42,682
Uh, Did Your...

460
01:05:42,684 --> 01:05:45,918
Did Your Husband Ever
Mention Seeing Anything?

461
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:48,220
You Leave My Norman
Out Of This.

462
01:05:48,222 --> 01:05:50,455
My Husband Was
A Good Man!

463
01:05:50,457 --> 01:05:53,458
I'M Sure He Was.
I Just...

464
01:05:53,460 --> 01:05:55,460
I Need To Know If

465
01:05:55,462 --> 01:05:58,663
He, Uh, Saw
Anything Unusual.

466
01:06:00,399 --> 01:06:02,500
That Room...

467
01:06:02,502 --> 01:06:05,469
It Was Supposed To Be
A Nursery.

468
01:06:05,471 --> 01:06:07,370
What Room?

469
01:06:08,605 --> 01:06:10,606
The East Guest Room.

470
01:06:10,608 --> 01:06:14,108
Only, The Wife
Couldn'T Have Children.

471
01:06:17,011 --> 01:06:19,245
But That Didn'T Stop Her.

472
01:06:22,082 --> 01:06:24,616
Wait A Minute.

473
01:06:24,618 --> 01:06:28,019
I Remember You.

474
01:06:28,021 --> 01:06:30,554
Those Children,

475
01:06:30,556 --> 01:06:32,722
The Ones You'Ve Seen?

476
01:06:32,724 --> 01:06:35,991
I Didn'T Mention
Anything About...

477
01:06:35,993 --> 01:06:38,059
They Need To Be Fed.

478
01:06:39,961 --> 01:06:42,162
They Should Have
Burned Her.

479
01:06:42,164 --> 01:06:43,963
Hanging'S Not Enough.

480
01:06:43,965 --> 01:06:47,466
You Need To Burn Her
Before It'S Too Late!

481
01:07:27,039 --> 01:07:30,374
I'M Sorry I'Ve Been
Acting So Strange Lately.

482
01:07:30,376 --> 01:07:33,076
It'S Just This House.

483
01:07:33,078 --> 01:07:36,345
That'S...
Totally Fine.

484
01:07:36,347 --> 01:07:38,347
It'S Okay.

485
01:09:05,531 --> 01:09:07,497
Where Are You?

486
01:09:11,335 --> 01:09:14,235
- I Know You'Re There.

487
01:09:14,237 --> 01:09:17,170
What Are You
Waiting For?

488
01:10:15,559 --> 01:10:17,593
Jess?

489
01:10:51,460 --> 01:10:53,594
Let'S See What
You'Ve Been Up To.

490
01:11:05,239 --> 01:11:06,872
Where'D You Go?

491
01:11:11,210 --> 01:11:13,277
There You Are.

492
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:17,347
What Are You Doing?

493
01:11:57,319 --> 01:11:59,286
Hello?

494
01:12:08,562 --> 01:12:10,729
An... Anyone There?

495
01:13:28,504 --> 01:13:30,371
Hey.

496
01:13:30,373 --> 01:13:32,539
You Out For
Another Walk?

497
01:13:32,541 --> 01:13:34,507
Yep.

498
01:13:37,945 --> 01:13:40,545
Are You All Right?

499
01:13:40,547 --> 01:13:44,415
No, I'M Not All Right.

500
01:13:44,417 --> 01:13:46,984
I Have A Headache.

501
01:13:46,986 --> 01:13:49,353
I'M Definitely
Coming Down
With Something.

502
01:13:53,491 --> 01:13:55,425
Where'S Wylie?

503
01:13:55,427 --> 01:13:57,760
Don'T Know.

504
01:13:57,762 --> 01:14:01,029
You Didn'T Take Him
Out With You When
You Went For A Walk?

505
01:14:01,031 --> 01:14:03,564
Nope.
He Wouldn'T Come.

506
01:14:05,133 --> 01:14:07,134
You Said It Yourself--

507
01:14:07,136 --> 01:14:09,436
He'S Been Acting Strange.

508
01:14:09,438 --> 01:14:12,071
Oh, He'S Been
Acting Strange?

509
01:14:18,845 --> 01:14:21,847
Wylie?

510
01:14:22,782 --> 01:14:25,683
Hey, Boy!

511
01:14:25,685 --> 01:14:27,685
Wyles!

512
01:14:27,687 --> 01:14:29,820
Come On! Come On!

513
01:14:29,822 --> 01:14:32,522
I'M Sure He'S Just
Out For A Walk.

514
01:14:32,524 --> 01:14:35,658
Hey, Um,
I'M Just Wondering,

515
01:14:35,660 --> 01:14:38,794
Were You Burning
Something In The Kitchen
Earlier This Morning?

516
01:14:38,796 --> 01:14:41,096
It'S Just
Some Incense.

517
01:14:41,098 --> 01:14:44,632
"Incense."
Okay, Um, Can You
Do Me A Favor

518
01:14:44,634 --> 01:14:47,568
And Not Do That Again?
Because It Smells Like Shit.

519
01:15:29,110 --> 01:15:31,211
Just Great.

520
01:17:56,714 --> 01:17:59,882
- What Are You Doing?
- Jesus!

521
01:17:59,884 --> 01:18:02,885
What Are<I> You</I> Doing?

522
01:18:02,887 --> 01:18:04,953
I Heard A
Sound Up Here.

523
01:18:04,955 --> 01:18:06,955
I Was Just
Investigating.

524
01:18:06,957 --> 01:18:09,023
Just Go To Bed.

525
01:20:50,080 --> 01:20:51,880
Jess?

526
01:20:53,449 --> 01:20:55,249
Jessica?

527
01:21:01,256 --> 01:21:03,023
Jess?

528
01:21:04,158 --> 01:21:06,493
Man, Where
The Hell Is She?

529
01:22:22,931 --> 01:22:24,598
Jess?

530
01:22:28,503 --> 01:22:30,568
Jess, You Down Here?

531
01:23:30,223 --> 01:23:32,157
Jess?

532
01:23:37,562 --> 01:23:39,596
What Have You
Done To Me?

533
01:23:47,203 --> 01:23:50,138
Let Me Out
Of This Thing.

534
01:23:50,140 --> 01:23:52,173
Jess...

535
01:23:57,077 --> 01:24:00,412
There'S An Evil
Inside You, Dan.

536
01:24:02,415 --> 01:24:04,482
But Don'T Worry.

537
01:24:05,750 --> 01:24:07,751
We'Ll Get It Out.

538
01:24:09,286 --> 01:24:12,288
Jess, Wait.
Just Listen, Okay?

539
01:24:12,290 --> 01:24:14,423
Stop It. Jess, Jesus!

540
01:24:17,060 --> 01:24:20,094
Jess, Hey, Stop.

541
01:24:20,096 --> 01:24:22,429
Please Stop!

01:26:45,731 --> 01:26:48,899
You'Re Crazy!
You'Re Crazy.

544
01:27:49,859 --> 01:27:52,227
I Wasn'T Expecting You
So Soon.

545
01:27:52,229 --> 01:27:55,396
- Traffic Was Quicker
Than We Had Expected.
- Ah.

546
01:27:55,398 --> 01:27:57,564

01:28:00,834 --> 01:28:03,268

Room For You.

549
01:28:03,270 --> 01:28:05,803
It'S The East Room,
Upstairs And To The Left.
