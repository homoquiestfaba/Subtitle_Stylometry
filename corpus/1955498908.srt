1
00:01:00,294 --> 00:01:02,496
(Loud music on headphones)

2
00:01:13,641 --> 00:01:15,776
(Screams)

3
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:23,083
(Growling)

4
00:02:30,551 --> 00:02:33,821
(Crows chirping)

5
00:02:33,854 --> 00:02:36,757
(Thunder rumbles)

6
00:02:42,396 --> 00:02:45,299
So...

7
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:47,835
My place...

8
00:02:47,868 --> 00:02:49,303
Or yours?

9
00:02:58,446 --> 00:03:00,314
(Door opens)

10
00:03:02,616 --> 00:03:04,718
Make yourself at home.

11
00:03:04,752 --> 00:03:05,853
Thank you.

12
00:03:21,469 --> 00:03:22,670
Here you go.

13
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:30,344
Here's one...

14
00:03:57,305 --> 00:03:59,340
So what do you do?

15
00:04:00,641 --> 00:04:01,875
I'm an investor.

16
00:04:04,645 --> 00:04:07,047
Mining.

17
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,450
Diamonds.

18
00:04:11,652 --> 00:04:14,555
Actually, I'm more on
the human side of things.

19
00:04:16,824 --> 00:04:18,959
Where are you from?

20
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:20,628
I'm from Paris.

21
00:04:20,661 --> 00:04:23,497
- Paris.
- Mm-hmm.

22
00:04:23,531 --> 00:04:25,399
I love Paris.

23
00:04:26,967 --> 00:04:27,935
(Laughs)

24
00:04:27,968 --> 00:04:29,403
My ex is from there.

25
00:04:31,705 --> 00:04:34,575
Are you looking
for a replacement?

26
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:37,511
Only if you feed me

27
00:04:37,545 --> 00:04:38,712
with news.

28
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:02,370
I'm Zoe Porter.

29
00:05:02,403 --> 00:05:05,038
And you're watching
avi world news.

30
00:05:05,072 --> 00:05:07,708
Here are the highlights
of the day.

31
00:05:07,741 --> 00:05:10,678
Dr. Danielle Laura,
financial advisor from Toronto,

32
00:05:10,711 --> 00:05:12,813
is among several
journalists missing

33
00:05:12,846 --> 00:05:16,384
after an alleged
vampire attack in Paris.

34
00:05:16,417 --> 00:05:19,420
It is speculated that drakula
is trying to scare the city

35
00:05:19,453 --> 00:05:20,754
into submission,

36
00:05:20,788 --> 00:05:23,557
a tactic used by drakula
and his cult members

37
00:05:23,591 --> 00:05:25,693
for centuries.

38
00:05:25,726 --> 00:05:28,696
Among the missing
is Ronnie keld from Paris

39
00:05:28,729 --> 00:05:31,432
who was traveling through
the carpathian mountains.

40
00:05:31,465 --> 00:05:33,701
We now go live
to Paris, France

41
00:05:33,734 --> 00:05:35,703
where our correspondent,
Beatrice arsenault,

42
00:05:35,736 --> 00:05:38,706
has the latest.
Hi, Beatrice.

43
00:05:38,739 --> 00:05:41,442
What can you tell us
about the missing victim?

44
00:05:41,475 --> 00:05:43,010
Hi, Zoe.

45
00:05:43,043 --> 00:05:45,646
It isn't clear
what drakula's motives would be,

46
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:48,115
but there is a lot of
speculation that the victims

47
00:05:48,148 --> 00:05:51,619
were murdered because of
their connections to the media.

48
00:05:51,652 --> 00:05:55,389
There has been a lot
more exposure on drakula

49
00:05:55,423 --> 00:05:57,825
and the cult in recent times.

50
00:05:57,858 --> 00:06:00,928
And this attack
could be meant as a warning.

51
00:06:00,961 --> 00:06:04,398
Can you tell us anything about
the leaked video footage?

52
00:06:04,432 --> 00:06:05,866
The video
has been taken down,

53
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:09,770
and avi news
has evidence

54
00:06:09,803 --> 00:06:12,139
against some of
the drakula cult members.

55
00:06:12,172 --> 00:06:14,141
Is our legal system
failing us

56
00:06:14,174 --> 00:06:16,076
when it comes to drakula
and his cult?

57
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:17,911
Your thoughts.

58
00:06:17,945 --> 00:06:22,783
Well, Paris sentiment is that
it is time to ratify our laws

59
00:06:22,816 --> 00:06:24,785
so that we have
great authority

60
00:06:24,818 --> 00:06:29,056
to prosecute vampires
and vampire supporters.

61
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:31,592
They are a cult
that has made it clear

62
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:33,594
they have little regard

63
00:06:33,627 --> 00:06:36,196
for all victims...
And life itself.

64
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:38,065
There are rumors...

65
00:06:38,098 --> 00:06:41,101
Hey, emmy, it's me.

66
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:42,936
Pick up. It's urgent.

67
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:44,705
Listen, I'm coming to Paris.

68
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:45,973
Call me back.

69
00:07:58,178 --> 00:08:00,280
(Camera shutters clicking)

70
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:02,783
(Reporters chattering)

71
00:08:20,701 --> 00:08:24,738
People need
vampires because...

72
00:08:24,772 --> 00:08:25,973
We are sad.

73
00:08:28,909 --> 00:08:31,612
Politics suck,

74
00:08:31,645 --> 00:08:33,513
country sucks.

75
00:08:35,115 --> 00:08:37,785
We need to see
drakula for...

76
00:08:37,818 --> 00:08:39,119
For fantasy,

77
00:08:39,152 --> 00:08:40,921
for...

78
00:08:40,954 --> 00:08:42,823
For laughing.

79
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:46,193
For thinking
about love and...

80
00:08:46,226 --> 00:08:48,562
And, yeah...

81
00:08:48,596 --> 00:08:49,997
To dream.

82
00:08:53,233 --> 00:08:56,303
Drakula and his cult members
have been the prime suspects

83
00:08:56,336 --> 00:08:58,739
in many missing
persons cases.

84
00:08:58,772 --> 00:09:01,108
The mission
is normalization.

85
00:09:01,141 --> 00:09:03,977
This mission
is the new order.

86
00:09:04,011 --> 00:09:06,146
Drakula's stocks
are set to triple

87
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:08,315
as he gains support.

88
00:09:08,348 --> 00:09:10,651
Drakula is seen
as a kind of superstar

89
00:09:10,684 --> 00:09:12,185
who is half crazy

90
00:09:12,219 --> 00:09:15,923
trying to get
the inside scoop for the case.

91
00:09:15,956 --> 00:09:18,659
The death toll from
the latest vampire attack

92
00:09:18,692 --> 00:09:20,327
continues to rise.

93
00:09:22,262 --> 00:09:25,599
I love watching vampires.

94
00:09:25,633 --> 00:09:27,835
I feel great when I see one.

95
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:34,708
I feel very good inside.

96
00:09:34,742 --> 00:09:36,143
Like I'm somebody.

97
00:09:49,122 --> 00:09:51,792
You are the usual?

98
00:09:51,825 --> 00:09:52,926
Yeah.

99
00:09:54,662 --> 00:09:55,796
Watch the street.

100
00:09:55,829 --> 00:09:57,264
Sorry.

101
00:10:09,176 --> 00:10:11,378
(Speaks French)

102
00:10:17,217 --> 00:10:18,385
(Door buzzer buzzes)

103
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:23,290
(Shower running)

104
00:10:30,698 --> 00:10:34,367
Oh, how nice to see you!

105
00:10:34,401 --> 00:10:37,070
Emmy!
Emmy!

106
00:10:37,104 --> 00:10:39,339
It's good to see you!
When did you get in?

107
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:40,874
Yesterday.

108
00:10:40,908 --> 00:10:43,043
Valia didn't tell me
you were here.

109
00:10:43,076 --> 00:10:44,812
- I'm happy.
- (Moans)

110
00:10:46,346 --> 00:10:48,849
Thank you so much
for doing this with me.

111
00:10:48,882 --> 00:10:50,417
Hey, we're in
this together.

112
00:11:08,902 --> 00:11:11,338
You're gonna have
the adventure of a lifetime.

113
00:11:11,371 --> 00:11:12,372
Mm.

114
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:13,841
Oh, you know,

115
00:11:13,874 --> 00:11:15,042
it's so good to work
with people

116
00:11:15,075 --> 00:11:17,010
who are interested
in vampires.

117
00:11:17,044 --> 00:11:18,979
- I'm stoked.
- Ugh!

118
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:20,247
I'm just gonna
have a quick shower.

119
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,348
I'm so jet-lagged.

120
00:11:21,381 --> 00:11:22,883
I got it.

121
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:25,352
Hey, try to stay up
as long as you can.

122
00:11:25,385 --> 00:11:26,820
I'll try.

123
00:11:27,955 --> 00:11:30,690
(Police sirens)

124
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:38,398
Oh, thank you.

125
00:11:46,239 --> 00:11:48,108
You want?

126
00:11:48,141 --> 00:11:50,077
It doesn't make sense.

127
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:52,846
Who disclosed details
about the killings

128
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,015
on social networking sites?

129
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:58,151
And why were incriminating
photographs removed from sites?

130
00:11:58,185 --> 00:12:01,121
Paranoid and narcissistic
creeps, cult members,

131
00:12:01,154 --> 00:12:02,790
who intimidate people,

132
00:12:02,823 --> 00:12:05,793
savaging the reputation
of drakula's family

133
00:12:05,826 --> 00:12:07,027
and their lives,
protecting their

134
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,929
whereabouts.

135
00:12:08,962 --> 00:12:10,831
I know that
the images are sensational

136
00:12:10,864 --> 00:12:13,400
and very explicit.

137
00:12:13,433 --> 00:12:16,436
There's every possibility
that it could get worse.

138
00:12:16,469 --> 00:12:20,774
According to my source,
what they have is amazing.

139
00:12:20,808 --> 00:12:21,942
Why this?

140
00:12:21,975 --> 00:12:23,310
Why now?

141
00:12:23,343 --> 00:12:25,445
I'm interested in
finding the truth.

142
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:27,447
That you will
never get to sell.

143
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,416
You know
that it's impossible.

144
00:12:29,449 --> 00:12:30,884
They will
finish you off

145
00:12:30,918 --> 00:12:32,552
like agina.

146
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,822
There are things
you shouldn't interfere with.

147
00:12:34,855 --> 00:12:36,123
Go home or write
about something else.

148
00:12:36,156 --> 00:12:37,958
No, no.
You don't understand.

149
00:12:37,991 --> 00:12:39,927
I want to hear
their side of the story.

150
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:42,029
It's a huge media interest.

151
00:12:45,032 --> 00:12:48,201
The mission is called
normalization.

152
00:12:48,235 --> 00:12:49,903
The term "normalization"

153
00:12:49,937 --> 00:12:51,839
is used by
this group of vampires

154
00:12:51,872 --> 00:12:55,008
to describe the sect
who kill with impunity

155
00:12:55,042 --> 00:12:57,978
resulting in
a civil unrest and demand.

156
00:12:58,011 --> 00:12:59,279
In their view,
this division

157
00:12:59,312 --> 00:13:00,814
is the new order.

158
00:13:00,848 --> 00:13:02,482
Uniting a family

159
00:13:02,515 --> 00:13:05,886
dedicated
to an heroic existence.

160
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:08,989
Those alive,
those not yet born,

161
00:13:09,022 --> 00:13:11,391
and those already dead.

162
00:13:11,424 --> 00:13:13,793
Okay. So?

163
00:13:15,428 --> 00:13:18,331
So there's slow burn
in process at the castle.

164
00:13:18,365 --> 00:13:20,333
Put the media on.

165
00:13:20,367 --> 00:13:22,502
Ignore and move on.

166
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:24,004
What's the issue really?

167
00:13:24,037 --> 00:13:27,040
This issue is privacy
not behavior.

168
00:13:27,074 --> 00:13:28,575
It's jealousy.

169
00:13:28,608 --> 00:13:31,211
The fuckers aren't as rich
and having as much fun?

170
00:13:31,244 --> 00:13:32,512
Surprise, surprise.

171
00:13:32,545 --> 00:13:34,547
It appears
history repeats itself

172
00:13:34,581 --> 00:13:36,984
and is a good fit
for the silly world

173
00:13:37,017 --> 00:13:37,951
of journalists.

174
00:13:37,985 --> 00:13:39,219
Mm, hmm, hmm, hmm.

175
00:13:39,252 --> 00:13:42,489
(Giggles)

176
00:13:42,522 --> 00:13:45,458
It's my job to cut through
the spirit of social rebellion

177
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:48,028
so the rest of the world
can dignify it.

178
00:13:48,061 --> 00:13:49,897
But it's up to the world
to decide.

179
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:51,865
I'm sure that the people
of transylvania will be happy

180
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:54,334
the country
is being talked about...

181
00:13:54,367 --> 00:13:57,070
Famous once more.

182
00:13:57,104 --> 00:13:58,906
The issue is

183
00:13:58,939 --> 00:14:02,409
no people will criticize
drakula's family out of fear.

184
00:14:02,442 --> 00:14:05,278
The nominal role in society
is an insult to people

185
00:14:05,312 --> 00:14:08,315
who have generally risked
their lives or body parts

186
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:12,185
because no one will dare to say
a bad word about the family.

187
00:14:12,219 --> 00:14:14,888
But drakula doesn't care
what you think

188
00:14:14,922 --> 00:14:17,424
and neither do the vampire.

189
00:14:17,457 --> 00:14:19,159
What the fuck
do you think it is?

190
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:21,929
Twilight?
Sleeping in coffins?

191
00:14:21,962 --> 00:14:23,296
A stake through the heart?

192
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:25,032
Oh, oh, I got it.

193
00:14:25,065 --> 00:14:26,299
Ah, ah, ah...

194
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:28,568
It's changing
shapes and forms.

195
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:30,270
Oh, I gotta go!

196
00:14:30,303 --> 00:14:31,504
(Chuckles)

197
00:14:38,611 --> 00:14:40,447
Text me pictures
of the cult?

198
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,082
I want to see.

199
00:14:42,115 --> 00:14:44,417
You never listen, Hannah.

200
00:14:44,451 --> 00:14:45,452
(Scoffs)

201
00:14:45,485 --> 00:14:46,886
See you soon.

202
00:14:48,588 --> 00:14:50,423
(Thunder rumbles)

203
00:14:50,457 --> 00:14:52,492
(Police siren wailing)

204
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,476
(Computer keys clicking)

205
00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:11,344
I'm hungry
for the new order.

206
00:15:13,013 --> 00:15:16,216
Yeah, we all news lovers
suffering from...

207
00:15:17,617 --> 00:15:19,586
Yes.

208
00:15:19,619 --> 00:15:22,622
I'm willing to risk fines
for my company if...

209
00:15:22,655 --> 00:15:24,291
Yeah,

210
00:15:24,324 --> 00:15:27,127
if the benefits for boosting
circulation and revenues

211
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:30,130
outweighs any fines
for breaching the law.

212
00:15:30,163 --> 00:15:32,465
Okay.

213
00:15:32,499 --> 00:15:34,701
See you at the party.

214
00:15:34,734 --> 00:15:36,970
Okay, bye.

215
00:15:37,004 --> 00:15:39,472
Meeting with Christian
is set up.

216
00:15:39,506 --> 00:15:41,308
Who is he?

217
00:15:41,341 --> 00:15:43,243
This guy I met
in Vancouver.

218
00:15:46,646 --> 00:15:48,281
Is he a journalist?

219
00:15:48,315 --> 00:15:50,150
Nope,

220
00:15:50,183 --> 00:15:51,751
but I want him to help us.

221
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:54,321
To get him involved.

222
00:15:54,354 --> 00:15:55,688
His money
and his connections

223
00:15:55,722 --> 00:15:58,125
could get us info on the cult.

224
00:15:58,158 --> 00:15:59,092
(Phone chimes)

225
00:16:01,194 --> 00:16:03,696
Hey, Nate arrives
tomorrow from Amsterdam.

226
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:07,134
He is the journalist
I was talking about.

227
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:09,769
Great.
Can't wait to meet him.

228
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:13,640
Mm, did Xavier
send you the pictures?

229
00:16:13,673 --> 00:16:16,976
Uh-uh. He's going to
encrypt them first.

230
00:16:27,154 --> 00:16:30,057
- Glass of wine?
- Oh.

231
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:32,325
That sounds lovely.

232
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:45,172
(Bell tolling)

233
00:17:05,092 --> 00:17:08,095
(Horn honking)

234
00:19:29,569 --> 00:19:31,538
Oh, it's so
good to see you.

235
00:19:33,906 --> 00:19:35,408
You had a good trip?
Are you tired?

236
00:19:35,442 --> 00:19:36,809
No, no, no.
I'm fine, I'm fine.

237
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:40,647
But I do have to meet
Xavier in two hours.

238
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,748
Cool.

239
00:19:41,781 --> 00:19:42,949
Hey, come on, let's go.

240
00:19:42,982 --> 00:19:44,617
Yeah, let's go.

241
00:19:57,464 --> 00:19:59,466
(Bell tolls)

242
00:20:02,469 --> 00:20:03,936
(Heavy exhale)

243
00:20:07,474 --> 00:20:08,808
(Exhales)

244
00:20:19,486 --> 00:20:20,587
(Growls)

245
00:20:22,455 --> 00:20:25,658
Isn't she beautiful?

246
00:20:33,466 --> 00:20:35,368
New visitors in town.

247
00:20:36,936 --> 00:20:40,540
What do they know?

248
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:46,279
I don't know, Leon.

249
00:20:46,313 --> 00:20:48,915
Things could get

250
00:20:48,948 --> 00:20:52,785
out of hand, Corvinus.

251
00:20:52,819 --> 00:20:54,921
What do they want?

252
00:20:54,954 --> 00:20:57,657
(Moans)

253
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:02,529
They want to be us.

254
00:21:02,562 --> 00:21:03,696
(Moans)

255
00:21:05,965 --> 00:21:10,337
We're going to have to find
a new environment for them,

256
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:13,306
one in which
they can grant protection

257
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:16,309
for lives
and the lives of others?

258
00:21:16,343 --> 00:21:18,311
(Moans)

259
00:21:26,386 --> 00:21:29,021
I'm going to send you
to transylvania.

260
00:21:29,055 --> 00:21:30,757
(Moans)

261
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,825
You'll remain there
until we find a reason

262
00:21:32,859 --> 00:21:34,293
to make a change.

263
00:21:38,698 --> 00:21:40,733
(Moans)

264
00:22:04,857 --> 00:22:08,895
I wish to present Nate,
a good friend of mine.

265
00:22:08,928 --> 00:22:11,431
- Nice to meet you.
- Mm-hmm.

266
00:22:14,767 --> 00:22:15,968
(Speaking French)

267
00:22:29,649 --> 00:22:30,983
No.

268
00:22:36,756 --> 00:22:37,990
Let's see a price.

269
00:22:48,635 --> 00:22:50,570
(Laughs)

270
00:22:50,603 --> 00:22:51,871
(Speaking French)

271
00:23:07,854 --> 00:23:09,021
Okay?

272
00:23:09,055 --> 00:23:10,457
Okay.

273
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:12,058
Okay.

274
00:23:12,091 --> 00:23:13,526
That's okay for you?

275
00:23:22,835 --> 00:23:25,572
No, just, uh,
I just want this key.

276
00:23:27,173 --> 00:23:29,542
I want to get cracking.

277
00:23:29,576 --> 00:23:30,877
You guys are heading out?

278
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:32,679
- Yep.
- Well...

279
00:23:35,682 --> 00:23:37,684
It was a pleasure.

280
00:23:49,128 --> 00:23:51,498
- Bye, Nate.
- Merci.

281
00:23:54,133 --> 00:23:56,469
- Sure we can trust them?
- Yeah, we can.

282
00:23:56,503 --> 00:23:57,737
It's okay.

283
00:24:18,525 --> 00:24:20,527
(Chattering)

284
00:24:31,037 --> 00:24:32,605
Hey!

285
00:24:32,639 --> 00:24:33,773
- Hi!
- Hey.

286
00:24:33,806 --> 00:24:34,974
- Oh, my God!
- Look at you!

287
00:24:36,709 --> 00:24:38,745
- How are you?
- Good, how are you?

288
00:24:51,824 --> 00:24:54,093
(Speaking French)

289
00:25:19,218 --> 00:25:22,054
(Laughs)

290
00:25:22,088 --> 00:25:25,057
(Gasping)

291
00:25:25,091 --> 00:25:27,927
(Panting)

292
00:25:30,096 --> 00:25:32,865
(Tapping)

293
00:25:43,142 --> 00:25:44,611
We have to talk.

294
00:25:44,644 --> 00:25:46,278
I have something
important to tell you.

295
00:25:46,312 --> 00:25:48,748
We have to be
in sync on this.

296
00:25:48,781 --> 00:25:50,617
We're in sync, baby.

297
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:51,951
Yeah?

298
00:25:51,984 --> 00:25:53,119
Okay, then.

299
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:00,159
- You're blushing.
- Me?

300
00:26:00,192 --> 00:26:01,694
- Yeah.
- No.

301
00:26:01,728 --> 00:26:03,596
- Yeah.
- (Giggles)

302
00:26:04,997 --> 00:26:06,198
That's a nice place.

303
00:26:14,674 --> 00:26:16,175
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

304
00:26:16,208 --> 00:26:18,110
Cheers.

305
00:26:18,144 --> 00:26:20,112
(Speaking French)

306
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:27,019
Ooh.
A hugger?

307
00:26:27,053 --> 00:26:28,921
- A kisser.
- Oh.

308
00:26:32,324 --> 00:26:33,660
Ask her.

309
00:26:33,693 --> 00:26:35,962
Do you mind if I
steal him for a bit?

310
00:26:35,995 --> 00:26:37,296
No, it's okay.

311
00:26:37,329 --> 00:26:38,765
No, it's all right.

312
00:26:38,798 --> 00:26:40,733
It's all right,
it's okay.

313
00:26:40,767 --> 00:26:42,034
Okay.

314
00:26:42,068 --> 00:26:44,036
I'm not into a foursome.

315
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:46,739
After tonight,
you will be.

316
00:26:46,773 --> 00:26:49,141
Guys, meet Christian.

317
00:26:49,175 --> 00:26:51,177
Hey, I'm Nathaniel.
You can call me Nate.

318
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:52,979
I stream video footage

319
00:26:53,012 --> 00:26:54,681
and broadcast
the best fucking footage

320
00:26:54,714 --> 00:26:55,982
you'll ever see

321
00:26:56,015 --> 00:26:57,016
or hear.

322
00:26:57,049 --> 00:26:58,685
(Chuckles)

323
00:26:58,718 --> 00:27:01,353
Hi. Emmy.
Editor for az magazine

324
00:27:01,387 --> 00:27:04,056
and I'll publish your
mother's ass off.

325
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:05,792
My mother's ass?

326
00:27:05,825 --> 00:27:07,226
Hi, I'm Xavier.

327
00:27:07,259 --> 00:27:08,761
(Speaking French)

328
00:27:10,329 --> 00:27:12,164
Thanks, guys, for coming.

329
00:27:12,198 --> 00:27:13,966
And for helping me
with this project.

330
00:27:15,702 --> 00:27:18,237
It really means a lot to me.

331
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:21,173
(Laughing, chattering)

332
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:50,770
We need to look everywhere,
online, the fucking church,

333
00:27:50,803 --> 00:27:52,104
library...

334
00:27:52,138 --> 00:27:54,907
People, places, names.

335
00:27:54,941 --> 00:27:57,243
The bloggers on this...
Talk to people.

336
00:27:57,276 --> 00:27:58,277
What about
the government?

337
00:27:58,310 --> 00:27:59,712
The cult?

338
00:27:59,746 --> 00:28:02,214
Need a code or a sign.

339
00:28:02,248 --> 00:28:05,752
I promise
I will publish everything.

340
00:28:05,785 --> 00:28:09,088
It's a flattering
profile on the cult.

341
00:28:09,121 --> 00:28:11,423
We need information
and we need it fast.

342
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:20,933
(Speaking French)

343
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:26,806
Don't worry.
I know what I'm doing.

344
00:28:26,839 --> 00:28:29,108
Made extra money.

345
00:28:29,141 --> 00:28:30,442
How much? How much?

346
00:28:30,476 --> 00:28:32,144
(Chuckles)
How much money?

347
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:35,181
Big money.

348
00:28:43,155 --> 00:28:44,356
(Speaking French)

349
00:29:17,156 --> 00:29:20,092
I was part of the group
studying minerals in water.

350
00:29:20,126 --> 00:29:21,360
Cool.

351
00:29:21,393 --> 00:29:23,162
And did you see
those kids with...?

352
00:29:25,164 --> 00:29:26,032
Hey, Christian.

353
00:29:28,334 --> 00:29:31,037
Christian tells me
that he built a school

354
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:33,339
in Africa? Romania?

355
00:29:33,372 --> 00:29:35,341
That's great.

356
00:29:35,374 --> 00:29:39,011
Maybe he can take us there.
We can blog about it.

357
00:29:39,045 --> 00:29:41,413
Well, I got to go.

358
00:29:41,447 --> 00:29:42,882
See you soon.

359
00:29:42,915 --> 00:29:44,150
Bye.

360
00:29:49,388 --> 00:29:51,157
Well...

361
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:54,560
Let's have dinner
on Friday night and talk.

362
00:29:59,231 --> 00:30:00,432
- Deal.
- Deal.

363
00:30:20,419 --> 00:30:21,854
(Door opens)

364
00:30:23,956 --> 00:30:25,491
(Door closes)

365
00:30:25,524 --> 00:30:27,159
(Laughs)

366
00:30:40,572 --> 00:30:42,374
What are you looking at?

367
00:30:42,408 --> 00:30:45,044
- You.
- Hmm.

368
00:30:45,077 --> 00:30:47,513
- Are you drunk again?
- No, I'm not drunk.

369
00:30:47,546 --> 00:30:49,381
You're working too much.

370
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:54,586
I'm a little bit drunk.

371
00:31:03,562 --> 00:31:05,898
Time, time,

372
00:31:05,932 --> 00:31:07,333
what can I do?

373
00:31:12,571 --> 00:31:16,943
We need a strategy
to control the enemy and...

374
00:31:16,976 --> 00:31:18,444
And compromise
their weakness.

375
00:31:26,285 --> 00:31:28,454
You can hack
into their email.

376
00:31:28,487 --> 00:31:31,023
Would it be safe?

377
00:31:31,057 --> 00:31:33,092
- Safe is boring.
- Yeah, I know.

378
00:31:33,125 --> 00:31:35,027
But we have
to communicate mostly by

379
00:31:35,061 --> 00:31:37,663
encrypted Internet chat.

380
00:31:37,696 --> 00:31:40,166
Melanie thinks
footage was leaked

381
00:31:40,199 --> 00:31:44,303
from a former cult member
to a finance journalist.

382
00:31:44,336 --> 00:31:46,105
- Melanie?
- Yeah.

383
00:31:46,138 --> 00:31:49,208
Nate and I met her
earlier tonight.

384
00:31:49,241 --> 00:31:51,277
(Goth music plays)

385
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:07,053
(Goth music continues)

386
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:12,484
(Groans)

387
00:35:04,803 --> 00:35:06,572
(Gasps)

388
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:17,216
(Panting)

389
00:35:23,722 --> 00:35:26,425
(Sobbing)

390
00:35:36,568 --> 00:35:37,869
Why?

391
00:35:37,903 --> 00:35:41,207
Why did you do this?

392
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,641
Stop.

393
00:35:56,388 --> 00:35:58,724
Why?

394
00:35:58,757 --> 00:36:01,827
Why did you do it?

395
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:03,529
(Sobbing)

396
00:36:05,431 --> 00:36:07,733
Oh, my poor baby.

397
00:36:07,766 --> 00:36:09,668
You don't like my pleasure.

398
00:36:33,859 --> 00:36:35,461
(Gagging)

399
00:36:54,613 --> 00:36:57,883
(Bell tolling)

400
00:37:26,445 --> 00:37:28,414
This is not drakula's castle.

401
00:37:28,447 --> 00:37:29,815
This is vlad's castle,

402
00:37:29,848 --> 00:37:31,750
the real one.

403
00:37:35,821 --> 00:37:37,456
Seven castles
all claiming to be

404
00:37:37,489 --> 00:37:38,957
drakula's this,

405
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:41,327
drakula's that,
drakula's...

406
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:44,330
How the fuck
am I supposed to find it?

407
00:37:44,363 --> 00:37:47,666
Not all transylvanian sites
are associated with vlad.

408
00:37:47,699 --> 00:37:51,570
That guy was a
bad ass motherfucker.

409
00:37:51,603 --> 00:37:53,872
To join his legion,
each man had to let out

410
00:37:53,905 --> 00:37:57,543
blood into a glass
from which they all drank

411
00:37:57,576 --> 00:38:00,346
uniting the legion in death.

412
00:38:00,379 --> 00:38:02,314
To this day,
people claim they see him

413
00:38:02,348 --> 00:38:03,349
riding a horse

414
00:38:03,382 --> 00:38:05,417
in the carpathian mountains.

415
00:38:05,451 --> 00:38:08,019
- Where did you hear that?
- Oh, my dad is an historian.

416
00:38:08,053 --> 00:38:10,622
I grew up in those stories.

417
00:38:19,097 --> 00:38:22,000
(Reading names)

418
00:38:23,769 --> 00:38:27,473
They are painters.
Don't get it.

419
00:38:27,506 --> 00:38:29,007
You know what?

420
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,510
Let's Cypher the names
and send it to Nate.

421
00:38:31,543 --> 00:38:32,611
You bet.

422
00:38:34,012 --> 00:38:38,417
Secret crimes.

423
00:38:42,921 --> 00:38:44,990
May...

424
00:38:45,023 --> 00:38:47,526
May... Me...

425
00:38:47,559 --> 00:38:49,528
It's a g.

426
00:38:49,561 --> 00:38:51,697
Gula.

427
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:53,632
- Caligula.
- (Email tone)

428
00:38:53,665 --> 00:38:54,833
This is what Nate sent.

429
00:38:54,866 --> 00:38:57,569
Look.
Here.

430
00:38:57,603 --> 00:39:00,872
"The cult extorted
cash and property,

431
00:39:00,906 --> 00:39:03,942
facilitated human
trafficking for blood."

432
00:39:03,975 --> 00:39:07,779
"Over the past year,
the cult has launched

433
00:39:07,813 --> 00:39:10,048
one reality
television series."

434
00:39:10,081 --> 00:39:13,051
"The cult is filming
sacraments on drakula

435
00:39:13,084 --> 00:39:16,021
based in caligula"?

436
00:39:16,054 --> 00:39:18,056
The Roman emperor caligula

437
00:39:18,089 --> 00:39:21,793
who used vile means
to get to the throne.

438
00:39:24,095 --> 00:39:26,665
So the cult
is making films?

439
00:39:26,698 --> 00:39:28,967
They're doing remakes

440
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:33,004
based on old cult classics.

441
00:39:33,038 --> 00:39:34,139
Let's go.

442
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:57,128
It consists of more than
a hundred engravings...

443
00:39:57,162 --> 00:39:59,197
More than 50 drawings,

444
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:01,099
- and encrypted Internet code.
- Okay,

445
00:40:01,132 --> 00:40:04,470
but is there anything on it
about the cult in transylvania?

446
00:40:04,503 --> 00:40:06,872
- I couldn't break the code.
- (Sighs)

447
00:40:06,905 --> 00:40:08,607
Nate, you have
to be careful.

448
00:40:11,209 --> 00:40:12,678
Good luck.

449
00:40:55,186 --> 00:40:57,523
I've decoded
some of Xavier's data.

450
00:40:57,556 --> 00:40:59,658
Looks pretty interesting.

451
00:40:59,691 --> 00:41:01,627
Oh, my proxy server's
being so slow today.

452
00:41:03,729 --> 00:41:05,263
You know, looks like
there's a lot of information

453
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:06,798
here about the royals

454
00:41:06,832 --> 00:41:09,635
and some prince
of transylvania.

455
00:41:09,668 --> 00:41:11,603
Note to self.

456
00:41:11,637 --> 00:41:14,139
Some of the names
I was able to crack, however,

457
00:41:14,172 --> 00:41:16,875
looks like they are linked
to some sort of live footage.

458
00:41:16,908 --> 00:41:18,544
(Snapping fingers)
It's gotta be, um...

459
00:41:18,577 --> 00:41:21,179
Yes. A movie called
"secret crimes."

460
00:41:21,212 --> 00:41:22,648
Look for it.

461
00:41:26,585 --> 00:41:28,153
(Computer beeps)

462
00:41:28,186 --> 00:41:31,523
Judging by these names,
they could be doing films

463
00:41:31,557 --> 00:41:33,892
based on these peoples' work.

464
00:41:33,925 --> 00:41:36,061
Bathory.

465
00:41:36,094 --> 00:41:38,564
Mm, interesting.

466
00:41:38,597 --> 00:41:40,265
But Elizabeth Bathory
wasn't the painter.

467
00:41:40,298 --> 00:41:41,767
She was a serial killer...

468
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,735
(Laughs)

469
00:41:43,769 --> 00:41:46,538
Bathing in her victim's blood
to retain her beauty and youth.

470
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:49,608
That's
the fucking name.

471
00:41:49,641 --> 00:41:50,809
"Bathory."

472
00:41:50,842 --> 00:41:53,211
Encode it
and see what happens.

473
00:41:53,244 --> 00:41:56,047
Could be ciphered.
Type "countess."

474
00:41:57,583 --> 00:41:58,650
(Computer beeps)

475
00:42:02,788 --> 00:42:03,855
(Beep, beep)

476
00:42:07,225 --> 00:42:08,760
(Beeping)

477
00:42:08,794 --> 00:42:10,295
Bingo!
Hah!

478
00:42:10,328 --> 00:42:12,764
Okay, here.

479
00:42:12,798 --> 00:42:14,933
Type this in.

480
00:42:14,966 --> 00:42:16,234
See if it works.

481
00:42:16,267 --> 00:42:21,206
Uh, en dot walashia,
slash, movie.

482
00:42:25,744 --> 00:42:27,679
Nothing?

483
00:42:27,713 --> 00:42:29,180
Try zalia.

484
00:42:29,214 --> 00:42:30,548
(Beep, beep)

485
00:42:32,751 --> 00:42:34,886
- (Beep, beep)
- Ah, look at that.

486
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,888
One-time conspirator
and cult leader

487
00:42:36,922 --> 00:42:39,891
planting fear
and physical terror.

488
00:42:39,925 --> 00:42:41,893
Fuck.

489
00:42:41,927 --> 00:42:43,161
- (Loud noise)
- (Gasping)

490
00:42:47,633 --> 00:42:50,035
Here are the codes and signs
you are looking for.

491
00:42:52,804 --> 00:42:55,774
Okay. The money
is in your account.

492
00:42:55,807 --> 00:42:56,975
Fuck.

493
00:42:57,008 --> 00:42:58,844
Thank you.

494
00:42:58,877 --> 00:43:00,712
You must be careful.

495
00:43:04,683 --> 00:43:05,651
(Beep)

496
00:43:10,689 --> 00:43:12,791
Is that the same drive?

497
00:43:12,824 --> 00:43:13,992
It all came from Xavier.

498
00:43:14,025 --> 00:43:15,026
(Computer beeps)

499
00:43:35,714 --> 00:43:37,148
Hey.

500
00:43:37,182 --> 00:43:39,250
Looks like LA Bella lomond

501
00:43:39,284 --> 00:43:42,120
hacked into the email
of some corvinas

502
00:43:42,153 --> 00:43:45,090
exposing the wrongdoings
of the cult.

503
00:43:45,123 --> 00:43:48,026
Who the fuck is corvinas,
and why are we following him?

504
00:43:50,028 --> 00:43:50,996
You're gonna
have to ask Xavier

505
00:43:51,029 --> 00:43:52,030
if he can get us

506
00:43:52,063 --> 00:43:53,131
into a high-tech
facility.

507
00:44:31,236 --> 00:44:33,271
(Knocking on door)

508
00:44:47,786 --> 00:44:49,220
Okay, you gotta be
kidding me, right?

509
00:44:49,254 --> 00:44:51,857
Oh, come on.
Old technology dies hard.

510
00:44:53,959 --> 00:44:56,061
- We're gonna die here.
- No.

511
00:44:56,094 --> 00:44:57,929
It's exactly
what we need.

512
00:44:57,963 --> 00:44:59,397
What? 1980's?

513
00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:03,134
No. 1980's, yes.
1970's, that thing,

514
00:45:03,168 --> 00:45:05,070
- if it works.
- Ah, cool.

515
00:45:05,103 --> 00:45:06,404
You guys wanna
see what I did?

516
00:45:06,437 --> 00:45:08,273
- Yeah.
- Come on.

517
00:45:08,306 --> 00:45:09,707
Now take a seat.

518
00:45:19,250 --> 00:45:20,485
(Computer keys clicking)

519
00:45:20,518 --> 00:45:22,487
(Beep)

520
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:23,789
(Beep)

521
00:45:23,822 --> 00:45:25,223
Oh, click on the fish.

522
00:45:40,338 --> 00:45:41,840
Holy fuck.

523
00:45:50,882 --> 00:45:52,050
(Woman whimpers)

524
00:46:13,438 --> 00:46:15,406
(Whimpers)

525
00:46:25,851 --> 00:46:29,454
It's a tough life
being a messiah.

526
00:46:29,487 --> 00:46:32,958
Unfortunately, I can't be
your Mary magdalene

527
00:46:32,991 --> 00:46:36,461
and bathe your feet.

528
00:46:36,494 --> 00:46:39,197
- However...
- (Crying)

529
00:46:39,230 --> 00:46:41,432
I can save you from this

530
00:46:41,466 --> 00:46:43,134
if you give me
the name of your fellow

531
00:46:43,168 --> 00:46:45,837
investigative journalist.

532
00:46:45,871 --> 00:46:47,873
I don't know her name.

533
00:46:47,906 --> 00:46:49,174
Oh.

534
00:47:04,923 --> 00:47:08,393
I shall be guilty
of drinking your blood.

535
00:47:08,426 --> 00:47:10,261
Let me prove myself

536
00:47:10,295 --> 00:47:13,231
and so to let me
eat of your body,

537
00:47:13,264 --> 00:47:15,233
let me drink
of the cup.

538
00:47:15,266 --> 00:47:16,434
Oh...

539
00:47:19,004 --> 00:47:20,471
My martyr.

540
00:47:40,158 --> 00:47:42,460
(Church bell tolls)

541
00:47:50,936 --> 00:47:52,337
(Bell tolls)

542
00:51:36,794 --> 00:51:38,596
(Coughing)

543
00:52:11,729 --> 00:52:13,498
(Groans)

544
00:52:23,441 --> 00:52:25,743
(Laughs)

545
00:52:30,215 --> 00:52:32,317
(Shouts)

546
00:52:34,785 --> 00:52:37,655
Oh...

547
00:53:03,881 --> 00:53:05,316
Oh, my...

548
00:53:06,917 --> 00:53:07,952
What?

549
00:53:09,854 --> 00:53:13,224
Xavier was found dead.
It's all over the news.

550
00:53:13,258 --> 00:53:14,292
Look.

551
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:24,502
(Sobbing)

552
00:54:04,342 --> 00:54:06,277
(Computer beeps)
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

553
00:54:06,311 --> 00:54:07,612
Take a look at this!

554
00:54:07,645 --> 00:54:08,813
Come here!

555
00:54:11,349 --> 00:54:13,418
My battery is very low.

556
00:54:13,451 --> 00:54:15,953
That's the missing girl
veronique!

557
00:54:15,986 --> 00:54:18,623
Please.

558
00:54:18,656 --> 00:54:20,257
Please help me.

559
00:54:22,327 --> 00:54:23,894
I've been abducted.

560
00:54:25,730 --> 00:54:27,698
I'm thirsty.

561
00:54:27,732 --> 00:54:29,600
I want blood.

562
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:03,868
Hello.

563
00:56:26,951 --> 00:56:28,853
We have to find that place.

564
00:56:32,790 --> 00:56:34,158
(Laughs)

565
00:56:38,796 --> 00:56:40,931
Wanna do it here?

566
00:56:40,965 --> 00:56:41,999
Yep.

567
00:56:47,838 --> 00:56:50,608
There is a slow explosion
in the cult

568
00:56:50,641 --> 00:56:52,477
and a subject
of controlled silence

569
00:56:52,510 --> 00:56:54,779
by the dominant forces.

570
00:56:54,812 --> 00:56:56,213
There can be no motivation

571
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:58,816
other than greed.

572
00:56:58,849 --> 00:57:02,219
Hannah David,
world news, Paris.

573
00:57:02,252 --> 00:57:03,454
Cut!

574
00:57:05,690 --> 00:57:07,558
Looks great, hon.
Good job.

575
00:57:07,592 --> 00:57:08,759
Okay, cool.
Let's go.

576
00:57:43,628 --> 00:57:45,963
(Growls, chuckles)

577
00:57:56,541 --> 00:57:59,677
(Woman screams)

578
00:58:22,700 --> 00:58:24,268
(Whimpering)

579
00:59:04,374 --> 00:59:05,943
(Growling)

580
00:59:58,162 --> 01:00:01,098
(Heavy breathing)

581
01:00:58,155 --> 01:01:01,058
Is everything all right?

582
01:01:01,091 --> 01:01:02,359
Yes.

583
01:01:02,392 --> 01:01:03,794
Are you sure?

584
01:01:15,472 --> 01:01:18,709
I was lying on the sofa...

585
01:01:18,743 --> 01:01:20,711
Naked and it hit me.

586
01:01:20,745 --> 01:01:23,147
You have connections
in transylvania.

587
01:01:24,915 --> 01:01:26,150
So...

588
01:01:29,219 --> 01:01:31,455
What's the event?

589
01:01:31,488 --> 01:01:34,258
I want to find veronique,
a missing girl.

590
01:01:36,827 --> 01:01:38,095
A vampire.

591
01:01:38,128 --> 01:01:39,997
Where?

592
01:01:41,498 --> 01:01:43,033
In transylvania.

593
01:01:43,067 --> 01:01:45,903
How do you know
she's there?

594
01:01:45,936 --> 01:01:48,839
Sources.

595
01:01:48,873 --> 01:01:50,107
She can be anywhere.

596
01:01:50,140 --> 01:01:51,408
Trust me.

597
01:01:51,441 --> 01:01:53,811
She's there...

598
01:01:53,844 --> 01:01:55,445
Somewhere.

599
01:01:55,479 --> 01:01:59,750
If I can leak this,
it will be a triumph.

600
01:01:59,784 --> 01:02:01,952
It could work.

601
01:02:01,986 --> 01:02:03,187
It will cost you.

602
01:02:06,056 --> 01:02:08,292
But I don't see why not.

603
01:02:08,325 --> 01:02:11,996
How much?

604
01:02:12,029 --> 01:02:14,131
10, 20 gs.

605
01:02:18,969 --> 01:02:20,971
I could help as well.

606
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:25,209
- Hm?
- Really?

607
01:02:27,244 --> 01:02:29,346
I will pay you
for the goods.

608
01:02:29,379 --> 01:02:30,981
I know you will like it.

609
01:02:31,015 --> 01:02:34,051
Best thing you'll ever do.

610
01:02:42,059 --> 01:02:47,264
I know of a woman with some
incredible legends to tell.

611
01:02:54,138 --> 01:02:57,007
She lives in
the carpathian mountains.

612
01:02:57,041 --> 01:02:58,909
In a castle?

613
01:02:58,943 --> 01:03:01,245
No, no, in a house.

614
01:03:01,278 --> 01:03:04,014
But apparently,
she's a crone.

615
01:03:04,048 --> 01:03:07,317
My God!
I have goose bumps.

616
01:03:07,351 --> 01:03:09,319
Can I interview her?

617
01:03:09,353 --> 01:03:10,487
I think so.

618
01:03:14,491 --> 01:03:16,260
I'll make it happen.

619
01:03:43,353 --> 01:03:45,455
(Chuckles)

620
01:03:53,663 --> 01:03:58,668
I wanted to let you know
that I'm going to transylvania.

621
01:04:02,539 --> 01:04:03,874
Done deal.

622
01:04:03,908 --> 01:04:06,376
Well, you're not going alone.

623
01:04:06,410 --> 01:04:10,180
I don't wanna force you.

624
01:04:10,214 --> 01:04:13,383
Christian is on board.

625
01:04:13,417 --> 01:04:15,252
And I'm in.

626
01:04:15,285 --> 01:04:18,055
Of course.

627
01:04:18,088 --> 01:04:21,125
Hey, we're in
this together.

628
01:04:21,158 --> 01:04:24,128
- All right.
- Yeah.

629
01:04:24,161 --> 01:04:25,395
All right.

630
01:04:36,140 --> 01:04:39,276
Yeah, wait...

631
01:04:39,309 --> 01:04:42,546
Behind the orthodox church.

632
01:04:42,579 --> 01:04:44,114
Okay, cool.

633
01:04:44,148 --> 01:04:45,415
See you there.

634
01:04:45,449 --> 01:04:46,516
Okay, bye.

635
01:04:48,085 --> 01:04:49,553
Okay, do you know
where that is?

636
01:04:49,586 --> 01:04:51,388
Uh, that street to the left.

637
01:04:51,421 --> 01:04:53,123
Okay, let's go.

638
01:04:54,658 --> 01:04:58,462
So, we agreed
to 2,000 Euros.

639
01:05:00,164 --> 01:05:02,632
And you tell them
what you know,

640
01:05:02,666 --> 01:05:06,136
or what you don't know.

641
01:05:06,170 --> 01:05:07,371
Got it?

642
01:05:09,306 --> 01:05:10,440
2,000?

643
01:05:12,176 --> 01:05:14,644
My underwear
costs more than that.

644
01:05:14,678 --> 01:05:17,047
So, uh...

645
01:05:17,081 --> 01:05:20,017
Five grand or I walk.

646
01:05:21,218 --> 01:05:23,453
Two grand and you talk.

647
01:05:23,487 --> 01:05:25,622
Oh, they're coming.

648
01:05:25,655 --> 01:05:28,993
You always do this to me.

649
01:05:30,995 --> 01:05:32,662
- Hannah.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

650
01:05:32,696 --> 01:05:34,098
- Hey.
- Nate.

651
01:05:34,131 --> 01:05:35,565
- Nate, nice to meet you.
- Hi.

652
01:05:35,599 --> 01:05:37,701
- Emmy.
- Hello.

653
01:05:37,734 --> 01:05:39,603
Gabriella.

654
01:05:41,638 --> 01:05:46,977
Well, here we are
in beautiful transylvania.

655
01:05:47,011 --> 01:05:48,645
Great place for an interview.

656
01:05:51,181 --> 01:05:53,450
Gabby will tell you everything.

657
01:05:56,120 --> 01:06:00,124
I was walking by
the fortified reformed church

658
01:06:00,157 --> 01:06:02,326
on Parker street
here in cluj

659
01:06:02,359 --> 01:06:05,129
when I saw that woman
covered in blood.

660
01:06:05,162 --> 01:06:07,998
Her hair, her clothes.

661
01:06:08,032 --> 01:06:10,200
She told me
that she was robbed,

662
01:06:10,234 --> 01:06:12,002
but I know
that she was bitten

663
01:06:12,036 --> 01:06:15,039
by somebody
or something.

664
01:06:15,072 --> 01:06:18,108
She gave off
a magical aura.

665
01:06:18,142 --> 01:06:20,044
What happened after?

666
01:06:20,077 --> 01:06:21,478
I wanted to take her
to the hospital

667
01:06:21,511 --> 01:06:23,213
but she wouldn't.

668
01:06:23,247 --> 01:06:27,084
She was talking about
signs and types on buildings.

669
01:06:27,117 --> 01:06:31,055
Such as the synagogue,
the center of our predators.

670
01:06:31,088 --> 01:06:33,257
But there are those
signs that are bad luck.

671
01:06:33,290 --> 01:06:34,724
She was pretty out of it.

672
01:06:34,758 --> 01:06:36,326
I thought she was crazy,

673
01:06:36,360 --> 01:06:41,565
but when we got
to king ferdinand street,

674
01:06:41,598 --> 01:06:43,333
there it was.

675
01:06:43,367 --> 01:06:48,505
A sign painted on
the side of a building.

676
01:06:48,538 --> 01:06:50,407
It was very big.

677
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:53,243
So which building?

678
01:06:53,277 --> 01:06:54,511
The yellow one.

679
01:06:56,613 --> 01:06:58,215
What was the sign.

680
01:06:58,248 --> 01:06:59,649
A raven.

681
01:06:59,683 --> 01:07:03,019
She was talking about
the COD and the prince.

682
01:07:05,222 --> 01:07:06,690
The prince?
The prince of...

683
01:07:06,723 --> 01:07:09,059
Prince of transylvania.

684
01:07:09,093 --> 01:07:11,095
Reckless, evil doings.

685
01:07:12,762 --> 01:07:15,099
Like what?

686
01:07:15,132 --> 01:07:17,501
She said the new order
and New York.

687
01:07:29,379 --> 01:07:31,715
So, guys,

688
01:07:31,748 --> 01:07:36,120
this is the place
what I wanted to show you,

689
01:07:36,153 --> 01:07:39,489
the most important,
the most special because

690
01:07:39,523 --> 01:07:43,593
this is the place where
I saw her for the last time.

691
01:07:43,627 --> 01:07:46,363
You know what I mean?

692
01:07:46,396 --> 01:07:47,531
Come on.

693
01:07:55,639 --> 01:07:57,107
Watch for the bats.

694
01:08:00,177 --> 01:08:02,446
So...

695
01:08:02,479 --> 01:08:04,214
What do you
think about it?

696
01:08:04,248 --> 01:08:06,616
- Is this is where you got her?
- Yeah.

697
01:08:06,650 --> 01:08:09,686
She was up there.

698
01:08:09,719 --> 01:08:12,256
Yeah, you can take
some pictures.

699
01:08:12,289 --> 01:08:13,790
That's what I'm doing.

700
01:08:13,823 --> 01:08:16,626
Oh, my God!

701
01:08:16,660 --> 01:08:18,295
Oh, shit!

702
01:08:32,476 --> 01:08:33,610
(Gasps)

703
01:08:36,946 --> 01:08:38,715
(Groaning)

704
01:09:26,496 --> 01:09:27,797
Stay behind me,
stay behind me.

705
01:09:27,831 --> 01:09:29,366
Shh, shh, shh.

706
01:09:30,634 --> 01:09:32,202
(Squeals)

707
01:09:35,405 --> 01:09:36,606
Hey!

708
01:09:56,860 --> 01:09:59,396
(Phone rings)

709
01:09:59,429 --> 01:10:00,597
Hey.

710
01:10:00,630 --> 01:10:02,399
Bit of a problem.

711
01:10:02,432 --> 01:10:05,001
The asset is
in another city

712
01:10:05,034 --> 01:10:07,971
in a town called sighisoara.

713
01:10:10,607 --> 01:10:12,442
Are you sure you
wanna do this?

714
01:10:12,476 --> 01:10:15,279
Yeah, it's worth it, yeah.

715
01:10:15,312 --> 01:10:17,947
Hell, yeah,
I wanna meet 'em.

716
01:10:17,981 --> 01:10:20,817
I wanna interview
with the fucking guy.

717
01:10:20,850 --> 01:10:23,487
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Relax.

718
01:10:25,922 --> 01:10:29,593
Yeah, they're fine, yeah.

719
01:10:29,626 --> 01:10:31,261
Meet you where?

720
01:10:34,298 --> 01:10:35,932
Okay, cool.
See you soon.

721
01:10:35,965 --> 01:10:37,501
Thank you.

722
01:10:37,534 --> 01:10:39,469
Okay, see you there.

723
01:10:55,585 --> 01:10:58,422
Everything that gives rise
to the telling of this story

724
01:10:58,455 --> 01:11:00,790
occurs in drakula's
transylvania

725
01:11:00,824 --> 01:11:02,025
where he was raised.

726
01:11:16,740 --> 01:11:18,342
Uh, where is Christian?

727
01:11:18,375 --> 01:11:21,345
He's in the old clocktower
near there.

728
01:11:21,378 --> 01:11:22,912
Oh, okay.

729
01:11:26,015 --> 01:11:28,752
(Bell tolling)

730
01:11:37,427 --> 01:11:39,396
(Phone rings)

731
01:11:40,664 --> 01:11:41,665
Hey.

732
01:11:43,700 --> 01:11:44,734
Okay.

733
01:11:48,137 --> 01:11:49,939
Call you back in five.

734
01:11:53,910 --> 01:11:58,047
Along here I saw her walking
out from that building.

735
01:11:58,081 --> 01:12:00,083
Blooded.

736
01:12:00,116 --> 01:12:01,918
Blooded, blooded.

737
01:12:01,951 --> 01:12:04,888
Along here,
I saw her blooded

738
01:12:04,921 --> 01:12:06,956
walking out
from that building.

739
01:12:06,990 --> 01:12:10,360
And what happened?

740
01:12:10,394 --> 01:12:11,895
I wanted to help her,

741
01:12:11,928 --> 01:12:13,497
but she says I can't.

742
01:12:13,530 --> 01:12:15,732
No one can, no one can.

743
01:12:15,765 --> 01:12:17,967
That's sounds pretty good.

744
01:12:18,001 --> 01:12:20,437
Add a bit of paprika to it,

745
01:12:20,470 --> 01:12:24,874
little village story,
the carpathians.

746
01:12:26,476 --> 01:12:27,777
Well, come on.

747
01:12:27,811 --> 01:12:30,614
You're the shaman,
for fuck sakes!

748
01:12:30,647 --> 01:12:31,881
How much you want?

749
01:12:33,950 --> 01:12:36,352
- 1,000 Euros.
- (Laughs)

750
01:12:37,587 --> 01:12:38,822
No.

751
01:12:38,855 --> 01:12:40,356
500.

752
01:12:41,791 --> 01:12:43,359
I'll tell them the truth.

753
01:12:45,562 --> 01:12:47,397
Okay, okay, 500, 500.

754
01:12:47,431 --> 01:12:49,999
- (Phone chimes)
- 500.

755
01:12:53,102 --> 01:12:55,939
Along here, I saw her...

756
01:12:55,972 --> 01:12:57,741
Hey, man!
You shut up.

757
01:12:57,774 --> 01:13:00,176
Speak only in
Romanian with them.

758
01:13:00,209 --> 01:13:01,711
Make it 1,000, man.

759
01:13:01,745 --> 01:13:04,914
You made a lot of money
on the African deal.

760
01:13:04,948 --> 01:13:09,619
You have to figure out how
to benefit from the new order.

761
01:13:09,653 --> 01:13:10,954
You'll be great.

762
01:13:10,987 --> 01:13:13,957
(Speaking Romanian)

763
01:13:13,990 --> 01:13:15,158
Love it.

764
01:13:24,167 --> 01:13:25,101
10 g.

765
01:13:29,606 --> 01:13:30,674
Let's do this?

766
01:13:30,707 --> 01:13:33,677
Let's do it.

767
01:13:33,710 --> 01:13:36,480
So what can you tell us
about vlad the impaler?

768
01:13:49,526 --> 01:13:50,927
(Speaking Romanian)

769
01:13:53,897 --> 01:13:56,099
It's a high Mountain pass
and it's dangerous.

770
01:13:58,134 --> 01:14:01,104
What do you know about
the order of the dragon?

771
01:14:03,673 --> 01:14:05,809
(Speaking Romanian)

772
01:14:08,678 --> 01:14:11,648
To defend the cross
and fight the turks.

773
01:14:11,681 --> 01:14:15,018
I know, but I heard
that the dragon society

774
01:14:15,051 --> 01:14:17,487
has members in this town

775
01:14:17,521 --> 01:14:19,856
operating today.

776
01:14:19,889 --> 01:14:21,758
I don't know any members.

777
01:14:26,530 --> 01:14:27,997
I'll give you 10,000 Euros

778
01:14:28,031 --> 01:14:30,734
if you show me a member
and their symbol.

779
01:14:30,767 --> 01:14:31,935
He doesn't know shit.

780
01:14:34,170 --> 01:14:36,172
You can see them at night.

781
01:14:36,205 --> 01:14:37,774
Where?

782
01:14:37,807 --> 01:14:40,877
They use
the covered staircase

783
01:14:40,910 --> 01:14:42,579
which leads up to the church

784
01:14:42,612 --> 01:14:44,180
on the hill.

785
01:14:44,213 --> 01:14:45,749
It can be anyone.

786
01:14:45,782 --> 01:14:48,885
They have a place in covasna

787
01:14:48,918 --> 01:14:52,155
named after a very famous
mineral water.

788
01:14:53,923 --> 01:14:54,958
Okay, I go.

789
01:14:58,094 --> 01:15:01,064
What the fuck?
He's full of shit!

790
01:15:01,097 --> 01:15:04,668
You know the place.
I know you do.

791
01:15:04,701 --> 01:15:07,170
When you didn't drink
your mineral water in Paris.

792
01:15:07,203 --> 01:15:09,272
First time we met,
you said something about

793
01:15:09,305 --> 01:15:11,140
water in Africa.

794
01:15:11,174 --> 01:15:14,177
What the fuck
is going on here?

795
01:15:14,210 --> 01:15:18,782
I paid you 10 grand, man!
What the fuck is going on here?

796
01:15:18,815 --> 01:15:21,818
It's not that easy.

797
01:15:21,851 --> 01:15:24,087
It's dangerous.

798
01:15:24,120 --> 01:15:27,624
I don't have the location.

799
01:15:27,657 --> 01:15:29,826
- He's the shaman.
- You fucking liar!

800
01:15:29,859 --> 01:15:30,894
Come on.

801
01:15:32,696 --> 01:15:33,863
I paid you!

802
01:16:50,406 --> 01:16:51,941
(Growls)

803
01:16:55,244 --> 01:16:58,181
You fuck!

804
01:16:58,214 --> 01:17:00,183
(Screams)

805
01:17:32,081 --> 01:17:34,317
(Gasping)

806
01:17:46,796 --> 01:17:48,765
(Crying)

807
01:17:52,501 --> 01:17:53,870
(Screaming in distance)

808
01:18:17,861 --> 01:18:20,229
(Sobbing)

809
01:18:24,433 --> 01:18:27,003
I don't know what to do.

810
01:18:31,407 --> 01:18:33,242
We move on.

811
01:19:46,515 --> 01:19:48,551
(Speaking Romanian)

812
01:20:55,318 --> 01:21:00,556
Can you tell us about
the symbol at the entrance?

813
01:21:00,589 --> 01:21:02,025
(Speaking Romanian)

814
01:21:10,366 --> 01:21:12,936
They use the symbol
marking the path

815
01:21:12,969 --> 01:21:15,171
so people don't fall
into treachery.

816
01:21:15,204 --> 01:21:17,907
Oh, we want to be safe.

817
01:21:23,179 --> 01:21:25,949
Do you recognize her?

818
01:21:25,982 --> 01:21:28,551
Please help me.
I've been abducted.

819
01:21:28,584 --> 01:21:31,020
Do you recognize this place?

820
01:21:31,054 --> 01:21:32,021
I want blood.

821
01:21:32,055 --> 01:21:33,556
(Speaking Romanian)

822
01:21:36,525 --> 01:21:38,394
She was told
about veronique.

823
01:21:38,427 --> 01:21:43,432
Seen her in a house
with the symbol of a fish.

824
01:21:50,039 --> 01:21:51,507
It's not far.

825
01:21:51,540 --> 01:21:53,309
Walking distance
to the village across

826
01:21:53,342 --> 01:21:59,015
either side.

827
01:21:59,048 --> 01:22:02,986
The path is dangerous.
My way is safe.

828
01:22:03,019 --> 01:22:06,022
We only need an interview
with veronique.

829
01:22:06,055 --> 01:22:08,191
And the prince.

830
01:22:13,696 --> 01:22:17,200
Look for a house with
the symbol of a fish.

831
01:22:52,768 --> 01:22:54,537
(Phone rings)

832
01:22:56,339 --> 01:22:58,174
Emmy?

833
01:22:58,207 --> 01:23:01,177
Yeah.

834
01:23:01,210 --> 01:23:04,380
No.

835
01:23:04,413 --> 01:23:06,615
No, I don't see it.

836
01:23:06,649 --> 01:23:07,683
No, nothing.

837
01:23:07,716 --> 01:23:10,253
Nothing?

838
01:23:10,286 --> 01:23:12,455
Well, okay, where?

839
01:23:12,488 --> 01:23:14,390
Okay.

840
01:23:52,528 --> 01:23:55,631
Hannah?

841
01:23:55,664 --> 01:23:56,532
Hannah?

842
01:23:57,700 --> 01:24:00,403
Emmy, meet me up the hill.

843
01:24:00,436 --> 01:24:01,704
Do you hear me?

844
01:24:01,737 --> 01:24:03,472
I...

845
01:25:45,274 --> 01:25:46,242
(Wind howls)

846
01:25:48,977 --> 01:25:51,214
(Screams)

847
01:29:14,950 --> 01:29:16,919
(Gasping)

848
01:29:20,656 --> 01:29:23,125
(Heavy breathing)

849
01:29:42,778 --> 01:29:44,780
(Groans)

850
01:29:46,449 --> 01:29:47,650
(Gasps)

851
01:30:00,963 --> 01:30:03,432
(Gasps)

852
01:30:07,870 --> 01:30:10,739
(Whimpers)

853
01:31:04,560 --> 01:31:05,794
(Phone rings)

854
01:32:17,833 --> 01:32:20,135
(Sniffing)

855
01:32:45,694 --> 01:32:47,696
(Panting)

856
01:33:20,796 --> 01:33:22,597
(Shrieks)

857
01:33:26,001 --> 01:33:27,335
Christian, stop!

858
01:33:27,369 --> 01:33:29,705
Stop, please, stop!

859
01:33:29,738 --> 01:33:32,007
Please! No!

860
01:33:32,040 --> 01:33:34,076
(Shrieking)

861
01:34:03,806 --> 01:34:05,741
Why?

862
01:34:06,875 --> 01:34:08,944
Why, Christian?

863
01:34:51,253 --> 01:34:53,421
(Laughs)
