00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:44,485
It's not Christmas
morning yet.

360
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:47,592
There's still time
to set things right.

00:19:09,915 --> 00:19:11,143
What is that?

(GROUCHY HUMMING)

366
00:19:18,624 --> 00:19:19,921
- Oh!
- Whoa!

367
00:19:20,058 --> 00:19:21,025
Huh?

368
00:19:22,127 --> 00:19:24,493
- That's incredible.
- Look at this.

369
00:19:24,863 --> 00:19:25,887
(HUMMING)

370
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:28,023
Well, well. Look who's finally up.

371
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:30,859
Grouchy,
you did all this?

372
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,467
I even baked
a fruitcake.

373

(ALL GASPING)

374
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,437
And I was wrong.

375
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:38,669
Christmas isn't
a time for hating.

376
00:19:38,777 --> 00:19:40,802
That's what all
the other days are for.

377
00:19:40,913 --> 00:19:43,279
I was so busy focusing
on what I wanted

378
00:19:44,449 --> 00:19:46,440
that I didn't see
the real gift

379
00:19:47,286 --> 00:19:49,277
was having a family
that cares,

380
00:19:50,155 --> 00:19:52,089
even though
I'm Grouchy.

381
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:54,281
Merry Christmas.

382
00:19:55,394 --> 00:19:58,295
I know it's not the hang
glider you always asked for,

383
00:19:58,397 --> 00:20:01,764
but I made it
just for you.

384
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:04,097
Thanks, Papa.
A new hat!

385
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:10,341
(CHUCKLES)

386
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:12,577
Oh!

387
00:20:13,312 --> 00:20:14,973
I made it
for all of us.

388
00:20:20,953 --> 00:20:22,648
Merry Christmas,
everyone.

389
00:20:22,821 --> 00:20:24,789
(ALL) Yeah!
Merry Christmas.

390
00:20:26,858 --> 00:20:30,851
Hey, wait a minute. If Papa
knew I wanted a hang glider...

391
00:20:30,963 --> 00:20:33,557
PAPA: Remember,
it's just for you.

392
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:37,262
Merry Christmas,
everyone.

Whoo!

396
00:20:45,477 --> 00:20:46,739
Whoa!

397
00:20:46,878 --> 00:20:47,867
Oh!

398
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,106
(GASPS) Oh, no.

399
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:51,611
Ugh! I hate snow.

400
00:20:51,883 --> 00:20:55,683
And I hate being cold,
and I hate carrots.

401
00:20:55,954 --> 00:21:01,688
But most of all, I hate that
Christmas is only once a year.
