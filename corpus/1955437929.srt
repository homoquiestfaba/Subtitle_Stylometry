1
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:27,499
Ice tea, Jack?

2
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:30,369
Sure, Mrs. Miranda.

3
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:35,841
Sure is hot, isn't it, Jack?

4
00:04:35,843 --> 00:04:39,778
It sure is,
Mrs. Miranda.

5
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:43,682
Please, call me Jilly.

6
00:04:43,684 --> 00:04:46,818
Sure, Mrs. Miranda.

7
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:50,289
Jilly.

8
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:53,091
I like that,

9
00:04:53,093 --> 00:04:54,493
The way my name sounds.

10
00:04:54,495 --> 00:04:56,261
Coming off your lips.

11
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:02,234
Jack and Jilly.

12
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:10,842
Jack and Jilly went up the hilly.

13
00:05:10,844 --> 00:05:12,377
What are you doing?

14
00:05:12,379 --> 00:05:13,945
Relax, Jack.

15
00:05:13,947 --> 00:05:19,551
Mrs. Miranda,
where is Mr. Miranda?

16
00:05:26,592 --> 00:05:28,527
Wait, Jack.

17
00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:29,728
What?

18
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:31,096
What are you doing?

19
00:05:31,098 --> 00:05:32,397
What?!

20
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:33,198
It was too quick.

21
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,833
It was too fucking quick.

22
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:36,935
What are you talking about?

23
00:05:36,937 --> 00:05:39,705
Quiver, quake, tremble a little.

24
00:05:39,707 --> 00:05:41,306
I didn't feel any nervousness.

25
00:05:41,308 --> 00:05:42,474
It was just like the last time.

26
00:05:42,476 --> 00:05:43,742
And the time before.

27
00:05:43,744 --> 00:05:46,611
Just like last time and the time before?

28
00:05:46,613 --> 00:05:48,413
Jack and Jilly?

29
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:50,982
"Jack and Jilly
went up the hilly?"

30
00:05:50,984 --> 00:05:52,217
How many times are you going to use

31
00:05:52,219 --> 00:05:54,286
Jack and Jilly went up the hilly?

32
00:05:54,288 --> 00:05:57,489
I like Jack and Jilly went up the hilly.

33
00:05:57,491 --> 00:05:58,990
Yeah, I know you do.

34
00:05:58,992 --> 00:06:00,092
Well, listen, pal,

35
00:06:00,094 --> 00:06:01,226
This is my fucking fantasy.

36
00:06:01,228 --> 00:06:02,627
When you get your own pool,

37
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:04,596
You can orchestrate your own fantasies.

38
00:06:04,598 --> 00:06:05,897
Fine.

39
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:08,734
2 words for you, little man.

40
00:06:08,736 --> 00:06:10,869
Jackie fucking Collins.

41
00:06:14,507 --> 00:06:15,507
Bone up.

42
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:21,847
Jack and Jilly went up the hilly.

43
00:06:21,849 --> 00:06:24,716
To fetch a pail of water.

44
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:26,518
Give it to me!

45
00:06:35,428 --> 00:06:39,464
What in fuck's sake is going on here?

46
00:06:39,466 --> 00:06:40,466
Burt!

47
00:06:40,834 --> 00:06:41,933
I can explain.

48
00:06:41,935 --> 00:06:43,068
You see what I just did there?

49
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:45,470
I was beginning to suspect things.

50
00:06:45,472 --> 00:06:47,005
You see, Jack?
I see.

51
00:06:47,007 --> 00:06:48,707
He raped me, Burt.

52
00:06:48,709 --> 00:06:49,908
He raped me!

53
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:53,712
Jilly, Jilly...
Shut up!

54
00:06:55,349 --> 00:06:59,651
You want to do something
about that thing?

55
00:07:00,821 --> 00:07:01,953
Burt!
No, Burt!

56
00:07:01,955 --> 00:07:03,121
No, no!

57
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:05,357
Mr. Miranda...

58
00:07:05,359 --> 00:07:06,359
The pool guy.

59
00:07:07,393 --> 00:07:08,927
The pool guy.

60
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:09,728
You know what upsets me most,

61
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:11,096
Hand to god,

62
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:13,732
Is that you are a great pool guy, Jack.

63
00:07:13,734 --> 00:07:15,066
When Salvatore was our pool guy,

64
00:07:15,068 --> 00:07:16,535
I could never open my eyes underwater.

65
00:07:16,537 --> 00:07:18,503
There was too much chlorine,
they burned for a week.

66
00:07:18,505 --> 00:07:23,608
But with you, my eyes are always open.

67
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,510
I can play that game.

68
00:07:25,512 --> 00:07:26,511
You know, the one where I toss a penny.

69
00:07:26,513 --> 00:07:27,546
In the deep end,

70
00:07:27,548 --> 00:07:28,380
And then go hunt for it.

71
00:07:28,382 --> 00:07:29,314
With Salvatore,

72
00:07:29,316 --> 00:07:31,650
I could never play that game.

73
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:35,454
You weren't...

74
00:07:35,456 --> 00:07:37,022
No, Burt!

75
00:07:51,204 --> 00:07:52,404
This smells like shit.

76
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,641
It's because they're grown in shit.

77
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:57,843
You look at them?

78
00:07:57,845 --> 00:08:00,011
They're blue, means they're good.

79
00:08:00,713 --> 00:08:01,713
Pilot!

80
00:08:01,715 --> 00:08:03,114
What's it going to be?

81
00:08:03,116 --> 00:08:04,316
I only have 30 bucks.

82
00:08:04,318 --> 00:08:05,984
Pilot!

83
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:08,753
Look, just forget it, all right?

84
00:08:08,755 --> 00:08:10,088
Go read a book.

85
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:13,558
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you Jack Hayes,

86
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,827
The god of fuck.

87
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:17,295
Bro, you're never.

88
00:08:17,297 --> 00:08:18,997
Going to believe this shit!

89
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:20,765
I am so fucking fucked.

90
00:08:20,767 --> 00:08:21,766
I just had a...

91
00:08:21,768 --> 00:08:22,634
I already heard, dude.

92
00:08:22,636 --> 00:08:23,802
You heard?

93
00:08:23,804 --> 00:08:24,803
Yeah, Dylan and wheezer were by.

94
00:08:24,805 --> 00:08:26,104
Yo, what did they say?

95
00:08:26,106 --> 00:08:28,406
Whatever, dude, they're voids.

96
00:08:28,408 --> 00:08:30,375
The point is, Jack, can you find someone.

97
00:08:30,377 --> 00:08:31,676
A little more dangerous to fuck?

98
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:33,278
No.

99
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:36,348
But I tried, bro, I really fucking did.

100
00:08:42,822 --> 00:08:44,022
How was it?

101
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:46,458
Man...

102
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:48,393
It was sick.

103
00:08:48,395 --> 00:08:49,127
Give it to me.

104
00:08:49,129 --> 00:08:50,729
No.
Give it to me.

105
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,766
He shoves a .45
straight up my fucking nose.

106
00:08:54,768 --> 00:08:55,867
Grabbed this lamp...

107
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:00,972
Yeah, dude.

108
00:09:00,974 --> 00:09:01,907
Did you nut?

109
00:09:01,909 --> 00:09:03,842
Come on, pilot.

110
00:09:03,844 --> 00:09:06,144
No, of course not.

111
00:09:06,146 --> 00:09:07,279
Because no girl is worthy.

112
00:09:07,281 --> 00:09:08,547
Of the god of fuck.

113
00:09:10,983 --> 00:09:12,651
So what are you going to do?

114
00:09:12,653 --> 00:09:14,052
About what?

115
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:16,321
You've got to get the hell out of dodge.

116
00:09:16,323 --> 00:09:19,157
What are you talking about, man?

117
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:21,660
Burt Miranda.

118
00:09:21,662 --> 00:09:22,661
Yeah?

119
00:09:22,663 --> 00:09:24,429
Yeah, Burt Miranda!

120
00:09:24,431 --> 00:09:26,831
Yeah, I know Burt Miranda.
I was just in his bed.

121
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:28,033
You've got to bolt, Jack!

122
00:09:28,035 --> 00:09:29,568
What do you mean, I've got to bolt?

123
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:32,337
Do you know how much
he paid for those tits?

124
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:35,273
No, how much did
he pay for those titties?

125
00:09:35,275 --> 00:09:36,274
No sympathy, man.

126
00:09:36,276 --> 00:09:37,375
I got no sympathy for you!

127
00:09:37,377 --> 00:09:38,343
Come on.

128
00:09:38,345 --> 00:09:40,345
I've been telling you for months...

129
00:09:40,347 --> 00:09:42,547
Jilly Miranda is black death.

130
00:09:42,549 --> 00:09:44,783
You don't listen.

131
00:09:44,785 --> 00:09:46,184
You don't listen.

132
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:54,426
Yeah, sweet Connie.

133
00:09:54,428 --> 00:09:56,094
Y'all remember sweet Connie?

134
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,700
Single, no kids,

135
00:10:01,702 --> 00:10:05,437
Full-blown football
scholarship to state.

136
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:06,838
It all changed when that.

137
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,741
Delilah-eyed
sweet, sweet Connie.

138
00:10:09,743 --> 00:10:11,109
Moved to town.

139
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:15,180
Jerry, Rodney, shaker,
Dale, big bill, Clark.

140
00:10:15,182 --> 00:10:17,649
Dad, the name's dad.

141
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:20,118
Little bootie.

142
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:26,758
Nice work with Jilly.

143
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,059
What?

144
00:10:28,061 --> 00:10:31,596
I said, nice work with Jilly.

145
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:35,300
You heard, too?

146
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:37,302
Look, the thing about owning a pecker.

147
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:38,803
Is you've got to be responsible with it.

148
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:39,938
Check it out, bootie,

149
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:40,939
Clark's doling out.

150
00:10:40,941 --> 00:10:42,107
Some fatherly advice.

151
00:10:42,109 --> 00:10:43,241
He's drunk.

152
00:10:43,243 --> 00:10:45,243
I'm not drunk.

153
00:10:45,245 --> 00:10:46,711
Just a little happy.

154
00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:54,619
Yo, bootie.

155
00:10:54,621 --> 00:10:56,221
I got to take off.

156
00:10:57,957 --> 00:10:59,090
I know.

157
00:10:59,092 --> 00:11:01,960
For a while.

158
00:11:01,962 --> 00:11:03,728
Maybe a long while.

159
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:05,563
Yeah.

160
00:11:09,035 --> 00:11:10,068
Late.

161
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:11,569
Late.

162
00:11:17,643 --> 00:11:19,878
You know, the inside of her thigh...

163
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:29,287
Texture like I never came across again.

164
00:11:31,824 --> 00:11:33,425
Hey, Mrs. Kelson.

165
00:11:34,927 --> 00:11:37,362
Pilot ain't in.

166
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:39,364
He's at school.

167
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:43,034
He graduated 2 years ago,
Mrs. Kelson.

168
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:44,569
Whatever.

169
00:12:05,858 --> 00:12:07,058
Where's your boy, Hayes?

170
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,493
Which boy would that be?

171
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:11,563
Jack.

172
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:15,900
Everybody know these fellas?

173
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:19,237
Work for Burt Miranda.

174
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:22,474
Used to call you
"Miranda's pandas."

175
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:24,776
Hey!

176
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:05,416
What are we going to do?

177
00:13:05,418 --> 00:13:07,118
Well, we're not going to play.

178
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,821
The "is it me?" game
again, all right?

179
00:13:09,823 --> 00:13:10,789
Not again.

180
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:12,290
OK.

181
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:13,658
All right.

182
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:14,926
But is it me?

183
00:13:14,928 --> 00:13:16,161
No.

184
00:13:16,163 --> 00:13:18,263
What is it?

185
00:13:18,265 --> 00:13:22,066
A... A war wound.

186
00:13:22,068 --> 00:13:24,369
Really?

187
00:13:25,704 --> 00:13:26,805
Maybe.

188
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:36,314
But you do think I'm hot.

189
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:39,184
I... I... I...

190
00:13:39,186 --> 00:13:40,985
Pilot!

191
00:13:42,121 --> 00:13:45,323
Sorry, pi.

192
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:48,860
Pilot, I got to talk to you.

193
00:13:48,862 --> 00:13:49,928
Bye, Lucy.

194
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:51,362
Bye.

195
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:56,100
Pandas came by propane Lane.

196
00:13:56,102 --> 00:13:59,170
Let the games begin.

197
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:01,072
Look, he won't kill you, all right?

198
00:14:01,074 --> 00:14:02,106
That's for sure.

199
00:14:02,108 --> 00:14:03,174
No?
I mean, he's too rich,

200
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:04,175
He's paved half the valley,

201
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:05,276
He's got major juice.

202
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:06,811
Every wiseguy and high roller.

203
00:14:06,813 --> 00:14:08,646
Comes through Vegas knows Burt Miranda.

204
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:12,684
So if he won't kill me,
what does he want?

205
00:14:12,686 --> 00:14:13,918
You know, every hoodlum has his thing.

206
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,653
Burt Miranda's is, he has the pandas.

207
00:14:15,655 --> 00:14:17,121
Break the feet of his enemy.

208
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:19,958
Break my feet?

209
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,326
Break my feet?!

210
00:14:21,328 --> 00:14:22,894
He ain't breakin' my feet.

211
00:14:22,896 --> 00:14:26,164
Broken feet are the worst,
like black death.

212
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:27,398
Totally gothic.

213
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,100
I mean, like, you can't use crutches,

214
00:14:29,102 --> 00:14:30,134
You can't sit in a wheelchair.

215
00:14:30,136 --> 00:14:31,402
Because the weight distribution.

216
00:14:31,404 --> 00:14:32,604
Making all the blood flow to your ankles.

217
00:14:32,606 --> 00:14:35,106
And making it worse.
You can't do shit.

218
00:14:35,108 --> 00:14:36,474
I mean, you hobble.

219
00:14:36,476 --> 00:14:40,712
No, no, you stumble.
You stumble about.

220
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:43,047
It's completely gothic.

221
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:44,515
He ain't breakin' my feet.

222
00:14:44,517 --> 00:14:45,516
He is if he bags you.

223
00:14:45,518 --> 00:14:46,885
Well, he ain't baggin' me.

224
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,054
Because we're out of here.

225
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:51,055
"We?"

226
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:52,390
Yeah, we.

227
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:54,959
Man, I told you, Jack!

228
00:14:54,961 --> 00:14:57,028
I've got a lot of things going on here!

229
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:59,264
Pilot, you're a lifeguard.

230
00:14:59,266 --> 00:15:00,899
In a therapy pool, for Christ's sake.

231
00:15:00,901 --> 00:15:02,734
Look, I got to go
to scawldy's and cash out,

232
00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:04,502
I got to take Lucy back to work,

233
00:15:04,504 --> 00:15:05,803
I got to rent videos,

234
00:15:05,805 --> 00:15:07,205
I got to pick up some
TV dinners for my mom...

235
00:15:07,207 --> 00:15:08,339
You've been talking.

236
00:15:08,341 --> 00:15:09,507
About leaving
the veg for... for...

237
00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:10,508
Since you were 2!

238
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:11,509
This is enough.
No!

239
00:15:11,511 --> 00:15:12,510
Come on!
I'm out of here!

240
00:15:12,512 --> 00:15:13,711
Bro...
No!

241
00:15:13,713 --> 00:15:15,413
No. No!!

242
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:17,649
Bro, it'll be like

243
00:15:17,651 --> 00:15:20,852
Luke Duke, and the other guy.

244
00:15:20,854 --> 00:15:22,020
Really?

245
00:15:22,022 --> 00:15:23,121
Yeah.

246
00:15:23,123 --> 00:15:24,989
No!

247
00:15:24,991 --> 00:15:26,124
God!

248
00:15:26,126 --> 00:15:28,159
What am I supposed to do?

249
00:15:28,161 --> 00:15:29,394
You should go to Seattle.

250
00:15:29,396 --> 00:15:31,429
Seattle?

251
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:34,165
Definitely Seattle.

252
00:15:34,167 --> 00:15:36,467
Why Seattle?

253
00:15:36,469 --> 00:15:38,136
Does the phrase, "what the fuck"

254
00:15:38,138 --> 00:15:39,804
"difference does it
make to your ass, Jack,

255
00:15:39,806 --> 00:15:41,606
You ain't got no place else to go,".

256
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:42,941
Mean anything to you right now?

257
00:15:42,943 --> 00:15:45,543
All right, all right!

258
00:15:45,545 --> 00:15:47,946
God, just tell me why.

259
00:15:47,948 --> 00:15:49,414
Pop quiz.

260
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:50,581
Go.

261
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:52,083
Number of furious kill boys.

262
00:15:52,085 --> 00:15:54,686
That want to make wine out of your feet?

263
00:15:54,688 --> 00:15:55,586
3.

264
00:15:55,588 --> 00:15:57,255
Number of options you've got?

265
00:15:57,257 --> 00:15:58,456
Well, you know...

266
00:15:58,458 --> 00:15:59,691
Number of options you've got, Jack?

267
00:15:59,693 --> 00:16:00,491
I've got an aunt in south Dakota.

268
00:16:00,493 --> 00:16:02,160
Jack.
What?

269
00:16:02,162 --> 00:16:03,561
Number of options you've got?

270
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:06,164
Few.

271
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:08,032
Destination?

272
00:16:08,934 --> 00:16:10,034
Seattle?

273
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:12,470
Beep.

274
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:13,805
Perfect score.

275
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,808
Gold star, jacky.

276
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:18,443
Higher, bring it higher.

277
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:21,813
Get it all.
No fucking around.

278
00:16:21,815 --> 00:16:24,248
Hyah! Hyah!

279
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,383
Come on, bro.

280
00:16:25,385 --> 00:16:27,285
Keep it steady, hold it steady.

281
00:16:27,287 --> 00:16:29,153
What's up, ladies?

282
00:16:30,456 --> 00:16:34,158
Boys! What up!
What's up, Jack?

283
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,928
Jack!
The god of fuck, bro!

284
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:41,399
Bro, Jilly Miranda.
No. Hello?

285
00:16:41,401 --> 00:16:44,435
Hello? Bad dick!
Very bad dick!

286
00:16:44,437 --> 00:16:45,503
Bad dick!

287
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:46,738
Well, since I'm down here,

288
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,006
I might as well just for a little bit...

289
00:16:48,008 --> 00:16:50,541
How does everybody
on planet fricking earth.

290
00:16:50,543 --> 00:16:51,609
Know this shit already?

291
00:16:51,611 --> 00:16:52,610
You guys never know anything.

292
00:16:52,612 --> 00:16:53,811
You don't even know.

293
00:16:53,813 --> 00:16:55,947
That Kennedy was assassinated.

294
00:16:55,949 --> 00:16:58,016
Wait, George Kennedy was assassinated?

295
00:16:58,018 --> 00:17:01,052
Bro, Jilly Miranda is a deviant, OK?

296
00:17:01,054 --> 00:17:01,986
She's a major deve.

297
00:17:01,988 --> 00:17:04,655
She gets off on causing trouble, OK?

298
00:17:04,657 --> 00:17:05,957
But did she at least.

299
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:08,026
Make you bust
a little coo-coo?

300
00:17:08,028 --> 00:17:09,594
Did you? 11 years,

301
00:17:09,596 --> 00:17:11,362
He hasn't busted a nut, right?

302
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:12,663
Hey, 5.

303
00:17:12,665 --> 00:17:14,298
Taking it off over here, boss.

304
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,968
Hey, pilot, you little fuck,
did you sell that boom?

305
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:17,970
Yeah.

306
00:17:19,638 --> 00:17:20,872
Hey, shut up.

307
00:17:22,107 --> 00:17:24,075
Mayhem, shut the fuck up!

308
00:17:24,943 --> 00:17:26,110
All right.

309
00:17:27,112 --> 00:17:28,913
The hound has some major trust issues.

310
00:17:28,915 --> 00:17:30,548
With our boy pilot here.

311
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:31,549
Yo, wiping it off over here, boss.

312
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:32,717
Listen, I tell you,

313
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:34,052
Putting you down at that water park.

314
00:17:34,054 --> 00:17:35,753
Was an entrepreneurial milestone.

315
00:17:35,755 --> 00:17:37,121
Speaking of which,

316
00:17:37,123 --> 00:17:38,723
There's a rave over by whiskey Pete's.

317
00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:40,558
Yo, sip of water over here, boss.

318
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,561
Will you shut the fuck up
for a blink of an eye!

319
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:44,996
I want you over there.

320
00:17:44,998 --> 00:17:47,665
With some ghb and some
window pane, all right?

321
00:17:47,667 --> 00:17:48,833
Yo, I can't.

322
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:51,536
What?

323
00:17:51,538 --> 00:17:53,337
I can't, man.

324
00:17:53,339 --> 00:17:56,107
I'm... I'm going
with Jack.

325
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,077
Going with Jack where?

326
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:00,144
Scawldy!

327
00:18:00,146 --> 00:18:01,712
Scawldy!

328
00:18:01,714 --> 00:18:03,448
I've got to bail.

329
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:07,452
Of course, right.

330
00:18:07,454 --> 00:18:10,121
Burt Miranda.

331
00:18:12,459 --> 00:18:13,458
Of course, of course.

332
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:14,525
All right, man, that's cool.

333
00:18:14,527 --> 00:18:15,960
Where you guys headed?

334
00:18:17,062 --> 00:18:19,664
We're thinking Seattle, you know?

335
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:21,365
Jilly Miranda, man,

336
00:18:21,367 --> 00:18:23,201
I'd like to take a ride on her.

337
00:18:23,203 --> 00:18:25,436
Little sweet ass pooper,
you know what I mean?

338
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:27,472
Hee! Let's go.

339
00:18:27,474 --> 00:18:29,107
No, scawldy, look,

340
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:30,308
I've got to get out of here, all right?

341
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:31,375
What is your rush, boys?

342
00:18:31,377 --> 00:18:32,643
Come on, you've got the world.

343
00:18:32,645 --> 00:18:34,278
By a fucking string right here.

344
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,948
Scawldy!
I've got to go.

345
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:38,483
Yo, man, can I have my cut?

346
00:18:38,485 --> 00:18:40,251
They're after my fucking toes, man.

347
00:18:40,253 --> 00:18:41,253
<i>Fuck!!</i>

348
00:18:43,222 --> 00:18:46,023
Well, otay.

349
00:18:46,025 --> 00:18:47,692
Where you guys going?
Detroit?

350
00:18:47,694 --> 00:18:49,026
Dee-troit?

351
00:18:49,028 --> 00:18:52,630
Yeah, Detroit.
Detroit's cool.

352
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:53,931
Right on. Detroit's got
that old school shit,

353
00:18:53,933 --> 00:18:55,199
You know what I'm saying?

354
00:18:55,201 --> 00:18:56,534
Like motor city madman,

355
00:18:56,536 --> 00:18:58,669
Teddy, Teddy, Ted fucking nugent, man.

356
00:19:00,773 --> 00:19:02,907
You know, scawld,

357
00:19:02,909 --> 00:19:05,076
We're thinking about getting a stake.

358
00:19:05,078 --> 00:19:08,579
Sell as we go, finance the trip.

359
00:19:08,581 --> 00:19:09,914
The Detroit trip.

360
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:11,415
What are you boys thinking about?

361
00:19:11,417 --> 00:19:12,383
What do you need?

362
00:19:12,385 --> 00:19:14,852
Well, what do you got?

363
00:19:14,854 --> 00:19:18,589

Dude, I'm the fucking thing,

What is that thing at Thanksgiving,

368
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:26,430
The horn thing, the fucking horn thing.

369
00:19:26,432 --> 00:19:27,498
Overflowing with goodies?

370
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,200
The fucking horn thing.

371
00:19:29,202 --> 00:19:30,568
With all the fucking goodies coming out.

372
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:31,636
Nice working with you, fuckface.

373
00:19:31,638 --> 00:19:32,670
What do you call that thing?

374
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:33,704
A cornucopia.

375
00:19:33,706 --> 00:19:34,939
Aha, there you go.

376
00:19:34,941 --> 00:19:36,841
Pilot, my man, knows everything.

377
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:39,043
He's a regular goddamn pat sajak!

378
00:19:39,045 --> 00:19:40,077
I got it all.

379
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:43,247
I got the kind, daffy fucking bud, man,

380
00:19:43,249 --> 00:19:44,649
The hydro nuggety-nugs,

381
00:19:44,651 --> 00:19:46,050
Red fiber,

382
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:49,820
Herbal medications sweep upon the nation.

383
00:19:49,822 --> 00:19:52,523
The red, red, red, red fiber,
you know what I'm saying?

384
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:53,691
Pow! Pow! Pow!

385
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:55,993
I've got an amino acid concoction.

386
00:19:55,995 --> 00:19:58,095
Marinating in the back right now, man.

387
00:19:58,097 --> 00:20:01,065
It creates a totally profound excursion.

388
00:20:01,067 --> 00:20:02,733
It opens up all your fucking
pleasure glands,

389
00:20:02,735 --> 00:20:03,935
You know what I'm saying?

390
00:20:03,937 --> 00:20:04,835
Boom!

391
00:20:04,837 --> 00:20:06,037
You're like in a field of snow,

392
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:07,405
But you're really in sand.

393
00:20:07,407 --> 00:20:09,407
And you're making a goddamn little angel.

394
00:20:09,409 --> 00:20:11,576
Good god almighty,
you're creating symphonies,

395
00:20:11,578 --> 00:20:12,977
You had no idea!

396
00:20:12,979 --> 00:20:14,912
You'll be a genius, my friend.

397
00:20:14,914 --> 00:20:17,982
I got rock soaked in the wine cooler.

398
00:20:17,984 --> 00:20:21,085
I've got wine cooler...
Heh heh...

399
00:20:21,087 --> 00:20:24,155
That's been soaked in...
rock!

400
00:20:24,157 --> 00:20:26,190
I got these new 'ludes in powdered form.

401
00:20:26,192 --> 00:20:28,526
You snort it up!

402
00:20:28,528 --> 00:20:30,828
Your head flies open!
Aaaaah!

403
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:33,698
The bats fly in, they shoot out!

404
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,633
I fucking snapped out of it,

405
00:20:35,635 --> 00:20:37,501
I chomped about 4 of them, right?

406
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:38,636
And I was fucking the coke machine.

407
00:20:38,638 --> 00:20:39,870
In the motel 6.

408
00:20:39,872 --> 00:20:41,772
She was coming fresca, man, like crazy.

409
00:20:41,774 --> 00:20:44,742
I got some mushroom tea.
I got some ecstasy.

410
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:46,344
I got some opium.

411
00:20:49,449 --> 00:20:52,550
And I think I hear
the police coming after me.

412
00:20:52,552 --> 00:20:54,885
I hear the police coming,
I hear the police coming,

413
00:20:54,887 --> 00:20:58,189
I hear the police coming after me.

414
00:20:58,191 --> 00:21:00,591
What's it going to be, boys?

415
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:02,260
How about you give us two z's of endo,

416
00:21:02,262 --> 00:21:04,729
100 hits of e, and a page of blotter?

417
00:21:04,731 --> 00:21:06,564
That's my man, pots and pans.

418
00:21:06,566 --> 00:21:07,832
I have it ready.

419
00:21:07,834 --> 00:21:09,800
I'll fill your order.

420
00:21:09,802 --> 00:21:11,836
I can't believe that you told him,

421
00:21:11,838 --> 00:21:13,170
"we're thinking Seattle."

422
00:21:13,172 --> 00:21:15,806
What kind of total void are you, Jack?

423
00:21:15,808 --> 00:21:18,009
Pilot, relax, man.

424
00:21:18,011 --> 00:21:19,610
He thinks we're going to Detroit.

425
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:21,579
Yeah? Man,
tomorrow morning.

426
00:21:21,581 --> 00:21:22,680
That freak wakes up,

427
00:21:22,682 --> 00:21:24,348
His nipple ring's been torn off,

428
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:27,084
He's got a brand-new
monkey in his closet,

429
00:21:27,086 --> 00:21:28,319
And a 14-year-old
Asian boy.

430
00:21:28,321 --> 00:21:30,354
Lying next to him is in a diabetic coma,

431
00:21:30,356 --> 00:21:32,957
He won't remember a fucking
thing about last night.

432
00:21:32,959 --> 00:21:36,994
Except that we're taking
our trick asses to Seattle!

433
00:21:36,996 --> 00:21:38,429
Give me the keys.

434
00:21:42,167 --> 00:21:45,202
So we don't go to Seattle.

435
00:21:45,204 --> 00:21:46,737
We'll just go someplace else.

436
00:21:46,739 --> 00:21:48,306
Someplace else?

437
00:21:48,308 --> 00:21:49,707
Yeah, like I said,

438
00:21:49,709 --> 00:21:51,842
I've got an aunt in south Dakota.

439
00:21:51,844 --> 00:21:53,144
I got a cousin.

440
00:21:53,146 --> 00:21:56,580
In Albuquerque, tempe, valencia.

441
00:21:56,582 --> 00:21:58,349
Bro!

442
00:21:58,351 --> 00:22:00,685
There's a black belt convention in Reno!

443
00:22:00,687 --> 00:22:01,886
Come on!

444
00:22:01,888 --> 00:22:04,388
No. It's cool.
You're right.

445
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:08,826
I mean, scawldy thinks
we're going to Detroit,

446
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:11,562
Let's go to Seattle.

447
00:22:45,331 --> 00:22:47,398
Hi, you've reached the carnes'.

448
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,000
Billy's in Boston, Amy's in Seattle,

449
00:22:50,002 --> 00:22:53,204
But we're still here, so leave a message.

450
00:22:58,443 --> 00:23:00,845
That Lucy?

451
00:23:00,847 --> 00:23:02,079
Yeah.

452
00:23:02,081 --> 00:23:03,247
How did she take it?

453
00:23:05,283 --> 00:23:07,385
She took it fine, you know, I mean,

454
00:23:07,387 --> 00:23:09,153
Shit, all she's going to be without.

455
00:23:09,155 --> 00:23:11,856
Are my clever observations.

456
00:23:11,858 --> 00:23:13,657
You bang her yet?

457
00:23:13,659 --> 00:23:15,860
Not even close, man.
If "bang her".

458
00:23:15,862 --> 00:23:17,395
Is an island off the Caribbean,

459
00:23:17,397 --> 00:23:19,864
Me and Lucy are stuck
in traffic in Jersey.

460
00:23:19,866 --> 00:23:22,266
Whatever.
The point is,

461
00:23:22,268 --> 00:23:24,201
You haven't been
to the Dan d. Fine.

462
00:23:24,203 --> 00:23:26,370
Of course not, have you?

463
00:23:26,372 --> 00:23:28,906
Clark brought me there when I was 12.

464
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:30,141
Good old Clark!

465
00:23:30,143 --> 00:23:32,877
Who needs disneylands?

466
00:23:32,879 --> 00:23:35,679
It's on the way, maybe we could stop by.

467
00:23:35,681 --> 00:23:36,681
What for?

468
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:39,350
If there's something
wrong with your pipe,

469
00:23:39,352 --> 00:23:41,886
The Dan d. Fine
will clean it out.

470
00:23:41,888 --> 00:23:43,387
There's nothing wrong with me.

471
00:23:44,656 --> 00:23:49,427
Well, I mean, maybe...

472
00:23:49,429 --> 00:23:51,228
Look, man, we've got to put miles.

473
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:53,864
Between us and the veg, you know?

474
00:23:53,866 --> 00:23:54,999
And plus, you know, there are bound to be.

475
00:23:55,001 --> 00:23:56,300
Other places
like the Dan d. Fine.

476
00:23:56,302 --> 00:23:57,935
Further along down the road.

477
00:23:58,737 --> 00:24:00,204
What did you say?

478
00:24:00,206 --> 00:24:02,072
I mean, I think it's better.

479
00:24:02,074 --> 00:24:04,875
If we just skip it.

480
00:24:04,877 --> 00:24:09,246
Bro, there is nothing,

481
00:24:09,248 --> 00:24:11,515
Nothing, nothing, nothing,

482
00:24:11,517 --> 00:24:13,517
Like the Dan d. Fine.

483
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:16,620
So get in the fucking car.
Let's go, you pussy.

484
00:24:16,622 --> 00:24:18,088
Make a woman out of you yet.

485
00:24:36,075 --> 00:24:37,374
I don't know, Jack.

486
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,077
Good evening, gentlemen.

487
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:41,345
How you doing, frood?

488
00:24:43,181 --> 00:24:44,815
How's your dad, Jack?

489
00:24:44,817 --> 00:24:46,517
He's all right.

490
00:24:46,519 --> 00:24:47,485
Have a seat.

491
00:24:47,487 --> 00:24:49,286
Out of here.
You are out.

492
00:24:49,288 --> 00:24:51,989
I didn't even take out
the gock. Leave me alone!

493
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:54,158
Mauzner, I don't care
who your daddy is, OK?

494
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,392
It don't give you the right.

495
00:24:55,394 --> 00:24:57,628
To come in here and act like a virus!

496
00:24:57,630 --> 00:24:58,662
Can it!

497
00:25:01,099 --> 00:25:02,933
Good evening, gentlemen.

498
00:25:02,935 --> 00:25:05,703
Welcome
to the Dan d. Fine.

499
00:25:05,705 --> 00:25:08,205
My name is Naomi.

500
00:25:08,207 --> 00:25:10,441
Would you like to meet the ladies?

501
00:25:11,877 --> 00:25:13,244
Sure.

502
00:25:18,149 --> 00:25:19,650
What's up, dude?
Maker's rocks.

503
00:25:19,652 --> 00:25:22,520
Sorry, mauzner, I don't
think we should...

504
00:25:22,522 --> 00:25:23,621
Make it a double.

505
00:25:23,623 --> 00:25:25,222
Gentlemen.!

506
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:39,904
Huzzah, huzzah, huzzah.

507
00:25:39,906 --> 00:25:40,971
Come on in, babies.

508
00:25:40,973 --> 00:25:43,641
Meet your new boyfriends.

509
00:25:43,643 --> 00:25:45,743
Aren't they sweet?

510
00:25:45,745 --> 00:25:47,144
Come on, don't be shy.

511
00:25:47,146 --> 00:25:49,113
Let's move it, time is money.

512
00:25:49,115 --> 00:25:52,349
Come on. OK.

513
00:25:52,351 --> 00:25:53,851
Introduce yourselves, ladies.

514
00:25:53,853 --> 00:25:55,386
Sophie.

515
00:25:55,388 --> 00:25:57,087
Lois.

516
00:25:57,089 --> 00:25:58,756
Sally sue.

517
00:25:58,758 --> 00:26:00,524
Alexis.

518
00:26:01,627 --> 00:26:03,827
Look at those legs,
man, look at those legs.

519
00:26:03,829 --> 00:26:05,629
She used to wear these, like,

520
00:26:05,631 --> 00:26:09,333
Patent leather go-go
fuck-me boots riding up.

521
00:26:09,335 --> 00:26:10,668
One of these bitches quit.

522
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:13,904
And stole all her shoes, man.

523
00:26:13,906 --> 00:26:15,205
Damn shame, too.
I was hoping.

524
00:26:15,207 --> 00:26:16,640
To get a stomping tonight.

525
00:26:16,642 --> 00:26:18,342
Julie...

526
00:26:18,344 --> 00:26:20,077
You ever have a chick walk on your balls?

527
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:21,045
Yeah.

528
00:26:21,047 --> 00:26:22,546
Ever fuck a 14-year-old?

529
00:26:23,448 --> 00:26:24,448
Sir?

530
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:26,517
Dude, I...

531
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:30,788
I forgot everyone's names.

532
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:32,623
Amateur.

533
00:26:32,625 --> 00:26:36,460
OK. Go.

534
00:26:36,462 --> 00:26:42,666
Cindy, Jackie, snatchie,
cunty, assfuck, blow job.

535
00:26:42,668 --> 00:26:43,601
Dude, pick a girl.

536
00:26:43,603 --> 00:26:45,269
And stick your cock in her, man.

537
00:26:45,271 --> 00:26:48,639
Hey, let him take his time, all right?

538
00:26:48,641 --> 00:26:49,873
Whatever, dude.

539
00:26:52,344 --> 00:26:54,211
Yeah, I'll take Lois.

540
00:26:54,213 --> 00:26:55,713
Good choice.

541
00:26:55,715 --> 00:26:56,647
Come on, Lois,

542
00:26:56,649 --> 00:26:57,481
Take him away, baby.

543
00:26:57,483 --> 00:26:58,782
Unless you want your asshole.

544
00:26:58,784 --> 00:27:00,618
Felched with a crazy straw,

545
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:04,355
You're shit out of luck.
Do you get it? Shit.

546
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:09,727
So, how about you, pudding?

547
00:27:13,898 --> 00:27:16,100
No, I'm just along for the ride.

548
00:27:16,102 --> 00:27:19,370
What? Why?

549
00:27:19,372 --> 00:27:21,338
Bro, I don't pay for it.

550
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:22,873
What are you talking about, dude?

551
00:27:22,875 --> 00:27:24,108
That's the best part.

552
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:26,043
You can do whatever you want.

553
00:27:26,045 --> 00:27:27,511
To these girls, man.

554
00:27:28,546 --> 00:27:30,648
You can bend them over, fuck 'em in...

555
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:31,715
Mauzner!

556
00:27:31,717 --> 00:27:32,583
What?

557
00:27:32,585 --> 00:27:35,019
Just pick, OK?

558
00:27:35,021 --> 00:27:36,353
All right.

559
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,594
Bye-bye, guy.

560
00:27:55,907 --> 00:27:56,907
How was it?

561
00:27:59,478 --> 00:28:00,778
Yeah?

562
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:02,846
Yeah, come to daddy.

563
00:28:02,848 --> 00:28:03,947
There you go.

564
00:28:03,949 --> 00:28:05,382
Those pipes working?

565
00:28:07,385 --> 00:28:11,088
Man, I'm hungry,
let's get something to eat.

566
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:13,457
So it was cool, you know?

567
00:28:13,459 --> 00:28:15,459
I told her about my troubles
and she was like,

568
00:28:15,461 --> 00:28:19,363
"sexual confusion's
a tricky thing."

569
00:28:19,365 --> 00:28:21,732
Sexual confusion?

570
00:28:21,734 --> 00:28:24,768
I mean, easy on the sexual
confusion tip, baby.

571
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:27,604
Make me sound like that guy in a raincoat.

572
00:28:27,606 --> 00:28:30,240
With a fistful of vaseline, you know?

573
00:28:30,242 --> 00:28:32,743
Sexual confusion.

574
00:28:32,745 --> 00:28:36,880
You don't think I have
sexual confusion, do you?

575
00:28:36,882 --> 00:28:37,848
So soft.

576
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:39,249
Hey!

577
00:28:39,251 --> 00:28:40,984
I don't with Lucy, but...

578
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,689
Remember that night with Becky meadows?

579
00:28:45,691 --> 00:28:47,758
I was drunk, but...

580
00:28:49,194 --> 00:28:51,328
But, I mean, I boned her.

581
00:28:52,497 --> 00:28:53,664
I think.

582
00:28:56,401 --> 00:29:00,437
Bro, I boned Becky meadows.

583
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:04,341
Whatever.

584
00:29:04,343 --> 00:29:06,076
After the initial
pre-game jitters,

585
00:29:06,078 --> 00:29:07,544
It was a sensation, you know?

586
00:29:07,546 --> 00:29:10,214
Please, you've been rattling on.

587
00:29:10,216 --> 00:29:11,181
About the deep purple concerts.

588
00:29:11,183 --> 00:29:11,982
For the last 3 hours.

589
00:29:11,984 --> 00:29:13,016
Come on,

590
00:29:13,018 --> 00:29:15,819
I bought you a cheeseburger.

591
00:29:15,821 --> 00:29:17,154
I mean, you're homeless.

592
00:29:17,156 --> 00:29:18,756
Your entire life's
in the trunk of my car.

593
00:29:18,758 --> 00:29:19,757
You know what?

594
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:22,292
I don't think this is such a good idea.

595
00:29:24,963 --> 00:29:26,830
Sick fuck!

596
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:30,167
Nobody touches me!

597
00:29:30,169 --> 00:29:33,403
Nobody fucking touches me!

598
00:29:33,405 --> 00:29:35,005
Are you kidding me?

599
00:29:35,007 --> 00:29:36,206
Are you fucking kidding me?

600
00:29:36,208 --> 00:29:37,241
Are you?

601
00:29:37,243 --> 00:29:38,809
Are you fucking kidding me?

602
00:29:40,578 --> 00:29:43,847
She's just a fucking bitch.

603
00:29:43,849 --> 00:29:45,115
Get in your fucking car.

604
00:29:45,117 --> 00:29:46,950
<i>Get in your fucking car!</i>

605
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:53,557
It's all right, it's OK.
Deep breaths.

606
00:29:57,729 --> 00:29:58,996
Fucking cunt!

607
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:04,902
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

608
00:30:04,904 --> 00:30:06,837
Hey, what. You going
to beat me up, too?

609
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:13,443
I hate that word.

610
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:20,984
Fuck.

611
00:30:26,024 --> 00:30:27,024
You OK?

612
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:29,626
Yeah.

613
00:30:29,628 --> 00:30:32,129
Jesus, don't tell me.

614
00:30:32,131 --> 00:30:33,163
There was a time in days past.

615
00:30:33,165 --> 00:30:34,164
When you could hitch a ride.

616
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:35,332
And the driver didn't think.

617
00:30:35,334 --> 00:30:37,701
He could put it your fucking pail.

618
00:30:37,703 --> 00:30:38,502
Don't tell me.

619
00:30:38,504 --> 00:30:40,504
There was a time like that.

620
00:30:40,506 --> 00:30:42,806
Yeah, sure.

621
00:30:42,808 --> 00:30:44,808
My mom used to hitch all the time, and...

622
00:30:45,944 --> 00:30:46,944
She hates it in the pail.

623
00:30:49,714 --> 00:30:51,448
Shit.

624
00:30:55,587 --> 00:30:57,154
Let's bail, Jack.

625
00:30:57,156 --> 00:30:58,889
Yeah, let's.

626
00:31:04,929 --> 00:31:06,730
Jack.
Come on, man.

627
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,367
Hey, we're...

628
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:12,870
We're heading north.
If you'd...

629
00:31:14,105 --> 00:31:15,672
If you want to...

630
00:31:19,143 --> 00:31:20,143
OK.

631
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:31,054
Thank you.

632
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:41,598
Then there were 3.

633
00:31:54,045 --> 00:31:55,779
What's your name?

634
00:31:58,016 --> 00:32:00,250
Cassie.

635
00:32:00,252 --> 00:32:02,052
As in Cassandra?

636
00:32:02,054 --> 00:32:04,421
Yeah, as in Cassandra.

637
00:32:07,125 --> 00:32:08,859
What's your name?

638
00:32:11,529 --> 00:32:15,565
Pilot. This is,
this is Jack.

639
00:32:15,567 --> 00:32:18,201
Yeah? Why pilot?

640
00:32:18,203 --> 00:32:19,670
I don't like to talk about it.

641
00:32:19,672 --> 00:32:20,771
His mother picked up.

642
00:32:20,773 --> 00:32:22,406
An airline pilot one night...

643
00:32:22,408 --> 00:32:23,640
But Jack loves to.

644
00:32:23,642 --> 00:32:25,342
At a bar near d.F.W.

645
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:26,510
That's Dallas-fort worth.

646
00:32:26,512 --> 00:32:27,978
They fucked, the pilot left,

647
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:29,046
She got pregnant,

648
00:32:29,048 --> 00:32:31,248
Only she never caught the pilot's name.

649
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:32,716
Mom's a peach.

650
00:32:32,718 --> 00:32:35,118
So she named you pilot.

651
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,487
Exactly, Cassandra.

652
00:32:45,663 --> 00:32:47,331
Wow.

653
00:32:47,333 --> 00:32:48,465
Zowie.

654
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:49,967
What?

655
00:32:51,669 --> 00:32:53,370
You did a good thing.

656
00:32:54,473 --> 00:32:56,340
Most people when told the story.

657
00:32:56,342 --> 00:32:57,941
Will inevitably say...

658
00:32:57,943 --> 00:32:59,209
"good thing he wasn't
a fisherman."

659
00:32:59,211 --> 00:33:00,310
"good thing.

660
00:33:00,312 --> 00:33:02,412
He wasn't a
proctologist."

661
00:33:02,414 --> 00:33:05,415
"good thing he wasn't
an exterminator."

662
00:33:05,417 --> 00:33:06,883
OK, I see, because if the guy.

663
00:33:06,885 --> 00:33:09,786
Had been like a proctologist,

664
00:33:09,788 --> 00:33:13,991
Then pilot's name might be like...

665
00:33:13,993 --> 00:33:14,992
Sphincter.

666
00:33:14,994 --> 00:33:17,160
Exactly.
Or anus.

667
00:33:17,162 --> 00:33:18,161
Or hemorrhoid.

668
00:33:18,163 --> 00:33:19,262
Or dingle Berry.

669
00:33:19,264 --> 00:33:21,932
All right, all right.
Can we stop?

670
00:33:26,571 --> 00:33:28,071
Fuck!

671
00:33:28,073 --> 00:33:30,007
Why don't you ease off the steroids,

672
00:33:30,009 --> 00:33:30,807
Snack time?

673
00:33:30,809 --> 00:33:32,676
Where are they, scawldy?

674
00:33:32,678 --> 00:33:34,244
You guys still working for liberace?

675
00:33:34,246 --> 00:33:35,712
He's dead, OK?

676
00:33:35,714 --> 00:33:37,581
Scawldy, don't be
a fucking douche bag, man.

677
00:33:37,583 --> 00:33:39,349
Just tell us where the little pricks are.

678
00:33:39,351 --> 00:33:41,718
I don't know who you're talking about.

679
00:33:44,323 --> 00:33:45,355
De-Detroit.

680
00:33:45,357 --> 00:33:46,390
What? Where?

681
00:33:46,392 --> 00:33:47,424
I didn't hear you.

682
00:33:47,426 --> 00:33:48,759
The fuckers are in Detroit.

683
00:33:48,761 --> 00:33:49,926
They went to Detroit.
You think I give a shit?

684
00:33:49,928 --> 00:33:50,794
Beat the fuck out of them.

685
00:33:50,796 --> 00:33:53,497
Just get out of my...

686
00:33:53,499 --> 00:33:55,098
Steven, check it out.

687
00:33:59,438 --> 00:34:01,204
Where you guys headed?

688
00:34:01,206 --> 00:34:04,474
We're thinking Seattle.

689
00:34:04,476 --> 00:34:05,575
Thinking Seattle.

690
00:34:07,246 --> 00:34:08,478
I love when this happens.

691
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,880
No, no, no, no.
Detroit?

692
00:34:11,683 --> 00:34:14,317
Yeah, it's pilot.

693
00:34:14,319 --> 00:34:17,320
Yeah, I met you guys at graduation.

694
00:34:17,322 --> 00:34:20,724
Look, Mr. Carnes, I'm going
to be in the Seattle area,

695
00:34:20,726 --> 00:34:23,927
And I was just wondering
if you had a number for Amy.

696
00:34:23,929 --> 00:34:25,529
You don't.

697
00:34:25,531 --> 00:34:27,731
Yeah, work address is fine.

698
00:34:29,301 --> 00:34:31,835
I mean, the guy was
the original party poet.

699
00:34:31,837 --> 00:34:33,403
How did he get kicked out of west point.

700
00:34:33,405 --> 00:34:34,704
And write this shit?

701
00:34:34,706 --> 00:34:36,840
"Gaily bedight, a gallant knight,

702
00:34:36,842 --> 00:34:38,275
"in sunshine and in shadow.

703
00:34:38,277 --> 00:34:40,110
"Fell as he found, no spot of ground,

704
00:34:40,112 --> 00:34:42,045
That looked like..."

705
00:34:42,047 --> 00:34:43,914
Hold onto your spore, manler.

706
00:34:43,916 --> 00:34:45,315
Fuck off, goodwin.

707
00:34:48,453 --> 00:34:50,754
There were 2 enormous cockroaches.

708
00:34:50,756 --> 00:34:52,255
Fucking in the parking lot.

709
00:34:52,257 --> 00:34:53,290
You always take me.

710
00:34:53,292 --> 00:34:54,257
To the nicest joints, Jack.

711
00:34:54,259 --> 00:34:55,459
Hello, hello.

712
00:34:55,461 --> 00:34:57,594
Look at this trio.
The wise men.

713
00:34:57,596 --> 00:34:59,596
My bad.

714
00:34:59,598 --> 00:35:03,533
The 2 wise men and one very lovely gown.

715
00:35:03,535 --> 00:35:04,901
Here's 5 good ones.

716
00:35:04,903 --> 00:35:06,136
What do you say, kemo sabe?

717
00:35:06,138 --> 00:35:07,270
There's 5 good ones.

718
00:35:07,272 --> 00:35:09,539
And you are everything.

719
00:35:09,541 --> 00:35:11,641
You're...

720
00:35:15,379 --> 00:35:16,646
I'm Jonathan goodwin.

721
00:35:16,648 --> 00:35:18,248
The kids call me Johnny the fox.

722
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:20,250
Hey, Johnny the fox.

723
00:35:20,252 --> 00:35:21,885
What was all that about?

724
00:35:21,887 --> 00:35:24,621
That. That was just
about the world being.

725
00:35:24,623 --> 00:35:26,556
A fucking blender.

726
00:35:26,558 --> 00:35:28,391
And me being a wild strawberry.

727
00:35:28,393 --> 00:35:29,593
Speaking of which,

728
00:35:29,595 --> 00:35:30,894
You all look a little torqued,

729
00:35:30,896 --> 00:35:32,829
And I am the discoverer
of picker-uppers.

730
00:35:32,831 --> 00:35:34,064
Could I interest you.

731
00:35:34,066 --> 00:35:35,398
In something from the bam family?

732
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,667
A little crystal and such,

733
00:35:37,669 --> 00:35:39,269
Whatever your flavor is.

734
00:35:39,271 --> 00:35:42,639
We're actually
looking to move some ourselves.

735
00:35:42,641 --> 00:35:43,640
You got dance drugs?

736
00:35:43,642 --> 00:35:45,542
Yeah.

737
00:35:45,544 --> 00:35:46,810
Objectify.

738
00:35:46,812 --> 00:35:50,447
Some recently
synthesized m.D.M.A.

739
00:35:50,449 --> 00:35:52,282
Which has not yet been tasted.

740
00:35:52,284 --> 00:35:53,483
I know a place.

741
00:35:56,555 --> 00:35:59,356
Yeah! Come on,
baby!

742
00:36:11,869 --> 00:36:14,604
Check it out, baby!

743
00:36:14,606 --> 00:36:16,940
This is where we taste it, right?

744
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,380
Hoo!

745
00:37:11,329 --> 00:37:13,663
Pilot, do me a favor.
Let me do the talking.

746
00:37:13,665 --> 00:37:16,166
These kids are fucking terrified of me.

747
00:37:16,168 --> 00:37:19,302
Check it out!

748
00:37:19,304 --> 00:37:21,771
Johnny the fox.

749
00:37:21,773 --> 00:37:23,306
What's up?

750
00:37:23,308 --> 00:37:25,508
Ready to surf some warm waves, man?

751
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:26,610
How's that?

752
00:37:26,612 --> 00:37:28,878
Because I am choo choo Charlie.

753
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:32,215
And I got an "e" train
pulling out of the station.

754
00:37:32,217 --> 00:37:33,216
Get on board!

755
00:37:33,218 --> 00:37:34,517
You giving samples?

756
00:37:34,519 --> 00:37:35,852
That kind of greed makes me think.

757
00:37:35,854 --> 00:37:37,988
That you're already stoned, juicy boy.

758
00:37:37,990 --> 00:37:39,689
Come on, bitch.
Let's test the merch.

759
00:37:39,691 --> 00:37:41,591
Bitch? We're out of here,
pilot, good-bye.

760
00:37:41,593 --> 00:37:42,192
Not so fast, trick.

761
00:37:42,194 --> 00:37:43,260
What?

762
00:37:43,262 --> 00:37:45,762
Hey, muffin, what's your story?

763
00:37:45,764 --> 00:37:46,963
Who the fuck are you?

764
00:37:46,965 --> 00:37:48,365
You're a friend of the fox?

765
00:37:48,367 --> 00:37:49,666
Well, that ain't good.

766
00:37:49,668 --> 00:37:52,435
I heard he went down,
and he's going deep cover.

767
00:37:52,437 --> 00:37:53,903
Look, juicy, don't even play.

768
00:37:53,905 --> 00:37:57,607
Is that true?
You 5-0, muffin?

769
00:37:57,609 --> 00:37:58,875
'Cause if it's not,

770
00:37:58,877 --> 00:38:01,111
You'd look real good curled on the floor.

771
00:38:01,113 --> 00:38:03,913
Around my feet...
Purring.

772
00:38:03,915 --> 00:38:05,982
Yo, Harris, what the fuck is this?

773
00:38:05,984 --> 00:38:07,717
What? You want me
to switch it into hype?

774
00:38:07,719 --> 00:38:08,918
You know my bio.

775
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:11,154
You know about my 2 tours in the nam.

776
00:38:11,156 --> 00:38:14,524
Haung nguyen, mekong delta,
with a web-footed ape.

777
00:38:14,526 --> 00:38:19,195
You know how easy it is for
me to go back to that place.

778
00:38:21,666 --> 00:38:23,033
The nam?

779
00:38:23,035 --> 00:38:26,536
You were like 6 when
that shit was going down.

780
00:38:26,538 --> 00:38:27,971
Pilot, come on.

781
00:38:27,973 --> 00:38:29,172
Fucking get him, get him.

782
00:38:29,174 --> 00:38:30,407
Go.

783
00:38:30,409 --> 00:38:32,142
What's that thing on your finger?

784
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:35,912
My wedding ring.

785
00:38:38,749 --> 00:38:40,050
You're married?

786
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:45,789
It got annulled.

787
00:38:45,791 --> 00:38:48,792
What's that mean?
You got divorced?

788
00:38:48,794 --> 00:38:51,861
Yeah. I got divorced.

789
00:38:54,699 --> 00:38:56,833
Jack! Jack!

790
00:38:56,835 --> 00:38:57,901
Let's get the fuck out of here, Jack.

791
00:38:57,903 --> 00:38:58,768
What's up?

792
00:38:58,770 --> 00:39:00,103
Come on, let's bail.

793
00:39:13,718 --> 00:39:16,086
Pilot, I'm really sorry
about what happened back there.

794
00:39:16,088 --> 00:39:17,387
Man, I thought those guys were down.

795
00:39:17,389 --> 00:39:18,588
No.
I did.

796
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:20,256
It's fine, man.

797
00:39:20,258 --> 00:39:21,558
I'm sorry.

798
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,460
That's all, just sorry.

799
00:39:29,467 --> 00:39:30,533
What? You jealous?

800
00:39:31,502 --> 00:39:33,436
No.

801
00:39:33,438 --> 00:39:34,738
It's just...

802
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:36,740
You know, he's never let me drive before.

803
00:39:36,742 --> 00:39:38,208
Well, here's the news flash.

804
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:39,909
You realize if we boost the dose.

805
00:39:39,911 --> 00:39:42,212
To another 2 1/2
grams each of these 'shrooms,

806
00:39:42,214 --> 00:39:44,214
We can get completely mashed and...

807
00:39:44,216 --> 00:39:46,182
Where you going, anyways?

808
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:49,819
I got to meet up with
a friend, make a delivery,

809
00:39:49,821 --> 00:39:51,221
And then I'm off to the emerald city...

810
00:39:51,223 --> 00:39:52,922
Seattle.

811
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:54,657
Yeah?

812
00:39:54,659 --> 00:39:55,825
What about you?

813
00:39:55,827 --> 00:39:57,594
You know, I know somebody in Seattle.

814
00:39:57,596 --> 00:39:59,496
Of course you do.

815
00:39:59,498 --> 00:40:01,631
Amy carnes.

816
00:40:02,667 --> 00:40:03,466
Yeah.

817
00:40:03,468 --> 00:40:04,901
Best girl, ever...

818
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:06,936
In caps.

819
00:40:08,005 --> 00:40:10,006
Best girl ever.

820
00:40:10,008 --> 00:40:11,374
I'm feeling that.

821
00:40:11,376 --> 00:40:13,710
"Billy Johnson, he's our man.

822
00:40:13,712 --> 00:40:15,378
If he can't do it,
nobody can."

823
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,615
Totally.
Squad captain.

824
00:40:18,617 --> 00:40:21,017
Yeah. Wholesome dreams and...

825
00:40:21,986 --> 00:40:23,720
Tight little ass and...

826
00:40:23,722 --> 00:40:27,524
I mean, could I please have
a salad with no dressing?

827
00:40:28,893 --> 00:40:30,460
I know.

828
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:33,096
Night of graduation, man.

829
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:36,199
We had a thing.

830
00:40:37,034 --> 00:40:39,002
The rage-all-night
party.

831
00:40:40,805 --> 00:40:43,406
I never even thought she knew I existed.

832
00:40:45,409 --> 00:40:47,510
She cornered me in the bathroom,

833
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,881
Macked me.
We slow danced to.

834
00:40:51,883 --> 00:40:53,616
<i>Sweet child of mine,</i>

835
00:40:53,618 --> 00:40:56,486
Over and over, for hours.

836
00:40:58,489 --> 00:41:01,991
She said she always thought I was cool.

837
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:05,462
Always thought I was better.

838
00:41:05,464 --> 00:41:07,664
Than the forgettables I hung out with.

839
00:41:08,899 --> 00:41:10,066
"Forgettables?"

840
00:41:10,601 --> 00:41:12,235
Her word.

841
00:41:13,337 --> 00:41:14,971
She knew, man.

842
00:41:16,907 --> 00:41:18,274
She fucking knew.

843
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:21,845
You realize that people
are forgotten by people.

844
00:41:21,847 --> 00:41:24,347
Who remember every single day.

845
00:41:25,583 --> 00:41:26,749
I love her.

846
00:41:26,751 --> 00:41:30,053
Love, love, sweet love.

847
00:41:31,455 --> 00:41:33,289
Did you fuck her?

848
00:41:33,291 --> 00:41:34,891
No.

849
00:41:34,893 --> 00:41:37,126
Well, I mean, you know, I thought

850
00:41:37,128 --> 00:41:38,127
I would, you know,

851
00:41:38,129 --> 00:41:39,596
Like that summer, maybe.

852
00:41:39,598 --> 00:41:41,631
Bird in a hand, baby doll.

853
00:41:41,633 --> 00:41:43,700
She left soon after.

854
00:41:43,702 --> 00:41:45,401
To go...

855
00:41:45,403 --> 00:41:47,036
To Seattle.

856
00:42:12,263 --> 00:42:14,097
What's with those guys?

857
00:42:14,099 --> 00:42:16,533
We keep seeing them.

858
00:42:16,535 --> 00:42:19,435
No doubt headed
to the land of Amy carnes.

859
00:42:19,437 --> 00:42:21,170
Why?

860
00:42:21,172 --> 00:42:23,540
Kurt cobain, son.

861
00:42:23,542 --> 00:42:24,541
What about him?

862
00:42:24,543 --> 00:42:26,075
He killed himself.

863
00:42:27,912 --> 00:42:29,746
When?

864
00:42:29,748 --> 00:42:32,682
Yesterday.
He shot himself.

865
00:42:32,684 --> 00:42:33,850
For real?

866
00:42:33,852 --> 00:42:35,418
For real.

867
00:42:40,691 --> 00:42:41,824
Shit.

868
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:45,828
You cool?

869
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:47,096
Yeah, I'm cool.

870
00:42:47,098 --> 00:42:48,298
Tony Gomez is going to meet up with me.

871
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:49,999
And take me the rest of the way.

872
00:42:50,001 --> 00:42:51,534
Tell these guys I said hey, will you?

873
00:42:51,536 --> 00:42:52,936
All right, see you around then.

874
00:42:52,938 --> 00:42:54,571
Peace and chicken grease.

875
00:43:49,259 --> 00:43:50,360
You and me are the sheep.

876
00:43:50,362 --> 00:43:52,261
That he would do anything for.

877
00:43:52,263 --> 00:43:53,596
Anything.

878
00:43:57,034 --> 00:43:58,501
Nailed to the cross.

879
00:43:58,503 --> 00:44:00,503
Hey, you know where canyondale is?

880
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:02,839
Anna?

881
00:44:02,841 --> 00:44:04,674
What?
Come here.

882
00:44:04,676 --> 00:44:05,808
OK.

883
00:44:08,879 --> 00:44:10,046
Fetch my glasses.

884
00:44:10,048 --> 00:44:11,714
I took the kids there last year.

885
00:44:11,716 --> 00:44:12,815
To see the boy.

886
00:44:15,719 --> 00:44:16,886
It freaked them.

887
00:44:24,928 --> 00:44:26,329
You a pool boy?

888
00:44:29,066 --> 00:44:30,800
I used to be.

889
00:44:37,441 --> 00:44:38,574
What?

890
00:44:47,084 --> 00:44:48,251
You know, you guys.

891
00:44:48,253 --> 00:44:50,253
Aren't really doing it right.

892
00:44:50,255 --> 00:44:52,588
What do you mean?

893
00:44:52,590 --> 00:44:54,691
You want to do the
whole cross-country.

894
00:44:54,693 --> 00:44:56,225
On the road thing.

895
00:44:57,461 --> 00:44:59,829
You should be doing it in a convertible.

896
00:45:43,107 --> 00:45:46,042
What are you doing?

897
00:45:46,044 --> 00:45:47,343
Chill, relax.

898
00:45:47,345 --> 00:45:49,479
I'm making a fucking convertible.

899
00:45:49,481 --> 00:45:51,781
Yeah, but now we're
completely conspicuous.

900
00:45:54,152 --> 00:45:56,085
Right.

901
00:45:56,087 --> 00:45:58,221
Conspicuous to what?

902
00:45:58,223 --> 00:46:01,023
Umm...

903
00:46:01,025 --> 00:46:02,892
To the...

904
00:46:02,894 --> 00:46:04,360
To the...

905
00:46:04,995 --> 00:46:06,195
You know.

906
00:46:06,197 --> 00:46:08,397
You boys passing through?

907
00:46:08,399 --> 00:46:10,366
Yeah, we're heading for Seattle.

908
00:46:10,368 --> 00:46:12,869
Best you check out the boy.

909
00:46:12,871 --> 00:46:15,571
Excuse me?

910
00:46:15,573 --> 00:46:17,273
The boy.

911
00:46:17,275 --> 00:46:18,841
Best you check out the boy.

912
00:46:18,843 --> 00:46:20,143
Hey, where is the boy?

913
00:46:20,145 --> 00:46:22,044
Canyondale, right?

914
00:46:22,046 --> 00:46:23,846
That's right.

915
00:46:23,848 --> 00:46:26,516
I saw a poster for this shit inside.

916
00:46:26,518 --> 00:46:29,152
You'll get a kick out of it.

917
00:46:29,154 --> 00:46:31,254
Promise you that.

918
00:46:31,256 --> 00:46:33,456
You'll get a kick out of it.

919
00:46:34,992 --> 00:46:36,325
Well?

920
00:46:50,141 --> 00:46:51,474
Alligator...

921
00:46:52,943 --> 00:46:54,243
What?

922
00:46:54,245 --> 00:46:56,045
Alligator boy.

923
00:46:56,047 --> 00:46:57,280
That's the boy's name.

924
00:46:57,282 --> 00:47:00,149
His full name is alligator boy.

925
00:47:00,151 --> 00:47:02,385
He's about 20 miles from here.

926
00:47:02,387 --> 00:47:04,020
Dude, what do you mean, alligator boy?

927
00:47:04,022 --> 00:47:05,121
I don't know.

928
00:47:05,123 --> 00:47:08,424
It's just what the dude told me.

929
00:47:08,426 --> 00:47:09,425
What does that mean?

930
00:47:09,427 --> 00:47:10,493
I don't know what that means.

931
00:47:10,495 --> 00:47:11,727
Well, let's find out.

932
00:47:11,729 --> 00:47:13,796
Jack, Jack, we don't have time.

933
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:15,865
What is the rush?

934
00:47:15,867 --> 00:47:18,000
What is the rush?
Is there a rush?

935
00:47:18,002 --> 00:47:19,302
Don't ask me...

936
00:47:19,304 --> 00:47:20,369
It's not like we're meeting somebody.

937
00:47:20,371 --> 00:47:21,671
Up there, are we?

938
00:47:26,376 --> 00:47:27,977
Whatever, dude.

939
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:32,648
Can we just have 15 seconds of fun.

940
00:47:32,650 --> 00:47:34,317
In our miserable lives?

941
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:38,588
Famous fucking last words.

942
00:48:06,583 --> 00:48:07,683
Thank you, ma'am.

943
00:48:07,685 --> 00:48:09,752
You're welcome, sir.

944
00:48:21,098 --> 00:48:22,999
It'll be $10 each.

945
00:48:31,308 --> 00:48:32,541
Come on.

946
00:49:13,183 --> 00:49:14,750
Desmond?

947
00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:18,154
Desmond?

948
00:49:19,489 --> 00:49:20,856
Desmond?

949
00:49:21,325 --> 00:49:23,592
Tip?

950
00:49:27,764 --> 00:49:29,932
Sometimes he's shy.

951
00:49:31,001 --> 00:49:33,469
I think a little girl screamed.

952
00:49:33,471 --> 00:49:36,973
Desmond gets upset when they scream.

953
00:49:36,975 --> 00:49:38,107
Desmond?

954
00:49:54,925 --> 00:49:57,193
There he is.

955
00:50:10,307 --> 00:50:12,308
What's wrong with him?

956
00:50:12,310 --> 00:50:14,977
He's shy.

957
00:50:16,146 --> 00:50:17,713
No, I don't think that's what she means.

958
00:50:17,715 --> 00:50:20,616
I think she means, what's wrong with him?

959
00:50:20,618 --> 00:50:22,685
Yeah, that's what I mean.

960
00:50:22,687 --> 00:50:24,520
He's just bashful.

961
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:28,758
Unbelievable.

962
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:32,528
Unbelievable!

963
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:36,365
Hey, he suffers from,

964
00:50:36,367 --> 00:50:39,602
Ichthyosis, which is a,

965
00:50:39,604 --> 00:50:42,471
A thickening of the epidermis.

966
00:50:42,473 --> 00:50:46,642
And is not dangerous or contagious.

967
00:50:46,644 --> 00:50:48,711
He's also slightly brain damaged.

968
00:50:48,713 --> 00:50:51,747
And incapable of speech.

969
00:50:52,849 --> 00:50:54,150
He's 26.

970
00:50:55,419 --> 00:50:56,952
I'm 26.

971
00:51:01,091 --> 00:51:02,124
It's insane.

972
00:51:03,193 --> 00:51:04,627
26!

973
00:51:06,396 --> 00:51:07,963
What's he thinking?

974
00:51:09,032 --> 00:51:12,101
He probably wishes you'd
stop staring at him.

975
00:51:12,936 --> 00:51:14,537
Insane!

976
00:51:14,539 --> 00:51:16,939
This whole...
This is insane!

977
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:19,141
Look at him, Jack.

978
00:51:19,143 --> 00:51:21,477
He's like... he's the coolest
thing I've ever seen!

979
00:51:21,479 --> 00:51:22,711
He's an alligator, dude!

980
00:51:22,713 --> 00:51:24,313
He's an alligator boy!

981
00:51:37,894 --> 00:51:42,198
That'd be a cry laden
with pain and sorrow.

982
00:51:43,633 --> 00:51:46,235
In around 600 b.C.,

983
00:51:46,237 --> 00:51:48,537
There was a slave.

984
00:51:48,539 --> 00:51:51,974
A slave of wealthy Greek noblemen.

985
00:51:51,976 --> 00:51:54,376
He was horribly deformed.

986
00:51:54,378 --> 00:51:56,312
And all day long,

987
00:51:56,314 --> 00:51:58,914
This monstrous-looking man.

988
00:51:58,916 --> 00:52:03,486
Would spin wondrous tales
of heroic animals.

989
00:52:03,488 --> 00:52:05,821
Great tales, but they tended to show.

990
00:52:05,823 --> 00:52:07,389
The weaknesses of men.

991
00:52:08,892 --> 00:52:14,196
So, the storyteller
was killed by a crazed mob.

992
00:52:14,198 --> 00:52:15,898
Who were insulted.

993
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:19,935
That his stories showed
animals as brave and smart,

994
00:52:19,937 --> 00:52:23,305
And people as weak and stupid.

995
00:52:23,307 --> 00:52:26,275
Really? Wow.

996
00:52:26,277 --> 00:52:27,710
Amazing.

997
00:52:27,712 --> 00:52:29,178
Wait.

998
00:52:29,180 --> 00:52:31,614
The punch line is:

999
00:52:31,616 --> 00:52:34,984
The storyteller's name was aesop.

1000
00:52:36,219 --> 00:52:37,653
Really?

1001
00:52:39,089 --> 00:52:41,023
Wow.
Amazing.

1002
00:52:42,325 --> 00:52:44,627
As in <i>aesop's fables?</i>

1003
00:52:44,629 --> 00:52:46,195
Yes.

1004
00:52:47,398 --> 00:52:48,998
Really?

1005
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,232
Wow!

1006
00:52:50,234 --> 00:52:52,568
Amazing!

1007
00:52:52,570 --> 00:52:54,470
I... I didn't know that.

1008
00:52:54,472 --> 00:52:56,205
I didn't know that aesop was a freak.

1009
00:53:00,177 --> 00:53:01,377
So,

1010
00:53:01,379 --> 00:53:03,979
Where's Mr. Murray?

1011
00:53:05,949 --> 00:53:08,450
Long gone.

1012
00:53:08,452 --> 00:53:10,653
He couldn't accept des.

1013
00:53:10,655 --> 00:53:12,988
He left not long after des was born.

1014
00:53:12,990 --> 00:53:15,891
But then, des and I.

1015
00:53:15,893 --> 00:53:19,495
Went trooping with
a well known 10-in-one.

1016
00:53:19,497 --> 00:53:21,197
Des was the main attraction.

1017
00:53:21,199 --> 00:53:23,465
He made more money for the carnival.

1018
00:53:23,467 --> 00:53:25,434
Than the concession stands.

1019
00:53:25,436 --> 00:53:28,337
We're just trying to get
enough money together.

1020
00:53:28,339 --> 00:53:29,872
To move to south Carolina.

1021
00:53:32,042 --> 00:53:33,742
Why south Carolina?

1022
00:53:33,744 --> 00:53:38,681
It's a wonderful place,
parisville, south Carolina.

1023
00:53:38,683 --> 00:53:40,716
It's a small town, but for some reason.

1024
00:53:40,718 --> 00:53:42,451
It's become the winter quarters.

1025
00:53:42,453 --> 00:53:44,153
Of all the Southern carnies.

1026
00:53:44,155 --> 00:53:47,323
It's a virtual city of special people.

1027
00:53:47,325 --> 00:53:49,391
Tranquil and sunny.

1028
00:53:49,393 --> 00:53:51,994
Des would be happy there.

1029
00:53:51,996 --> 00:53:54,063
I know my des doesn't
have a lot of time left.

1030
00:53:55,031 --> 00:53:57,333
Well, about how much money you need?

1031
00:53:57,335 --> 00:53:59,535
A lot of money.

1032
00:53:59,537 --> 00:54:00,836
How about... how much?

1033
00:54:00,838 --> 00:54:04,039
About $5,000 would do us right.

1034
00:54:04,041 --> 00:54:07,109
With what we'd get for the house.

1035
00:54:07,111 --> 00:54:09,878
Well, we'll be back tomorrow.

1036
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:11,780
Before we leave,
we'll come say good-bye.

1037
00:54:11,782 --> 00:54:13,649
We'd like that.

1038
00:54:13,651 --> 00:54:15,484
We'd like that fine.

1039
00:54:26,896 --> 00:54:29,498
He was amazing, wasn't he?

1040
00:54:32,103 --> 00:54:33,335
Amazing.

1041
00:54:35,839 --> 00:54:40,309
Desmond the alligator boy
is a major happener.

1042
00:54:40,311 --> 00:54:41,410
Isn't he?

1043
00:54:41,412 --> 00:54:43,746
Whatever you say, pilot.

1044
00:54:43,748 --> 00:54:45,514
Would you want to be him?

1045
00:54:45,516 --> 00:54:47,082
What are you doing?

1046
00:54:47,084 --> 00:54:48,084
What?

1047
00:55:29,627 --> 00:55:30,926
Yes you did, dude!

1048
00:55:30,928 --> 00:55:32,127
I... I heard you.

1049
00:55:32,129 --> 00:55:33,629
Cassandra, did you hear?

1050
00:55:33,631 --> 00:55:35,497
I did. "When we go
and say good-bye,".

1051
00:55:35,499 --> 00:55:37,766
Like it was the stupidest
fucking thing you ever heard.

1052
00:55:37,768 --> 00:55:39,368
And it was my idea.

1053
00:55:39,370 --> 00:55:41,303
I did not say that.

1054
00:55:42,906 --> 00:55:44,973
But it was the stupidest fucking thing

1055
00:55:44,975 --> 00:55:46,108
I ever heard, by the way.

1056
00:55:46,110 --> 00:55:47,209
Why?

1057
00:55:47,211 --> 00:55:48,644
Are you guys, by any chance, in love?

1058
00:55:48,646 --> 00:55:50,646
Why? Bro,
why do we have to.

1059
00:55:50,648 --> 00:55:51,647
Go and say good-bye
tomorrow?

1060
00:55:51,649 --> 00:55:52,648
I mean, couldn't we just have.

1061
00:55:52,650 --> 00:55:53,816
Said good-bye today?

1062
00:55:53,818 --> 00:55:54,883
I'm gonna go take a shower.

1063
00:55:54,885 --> 00:55:56,051
I'll meet you all at the bar.

1064
00:55:56,053 --> 00:55:57,353
We gotta stop for the night anyhow.

1065
00:55:57,355 --> 00:55:59,288
I mean, we've been traveling for 2 days.

1066
00:55:59,290 --> 00:56:03,225
And plus, you know, I got some
things I gotta figure out.

1067
00:56:03,227 --> 00:56:04,593
What things?

1068
00:56:04,595 --> 00:56:08,097
I might lay some cash on her.

1069
00:56:40,029 --> 00:56:43,365
My girlfriend.

1070
00:56:43,367 --> 00:56:45,300
She is witchy though, isn't she?

1071
00:56:45,302 --> 00:56:46,535
If you say so.

1072
00:56:46,537 --> 00:56:47,669
Come on, give it...

1073
00:56:47,671 --> 00:56:48,570
Hey, bro, give it up.

1074
00:56:48,572 --> 00:56:51,006
Just get the bags!

1075
00:57:00,383 --> 00:57:03,485
You may... maybe you
shouldn't do that.

1076
00:57:11,394 --> 00:57:13,128
Yikes!

1077
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:19,568
Just up the hill is a house.

1078
00:57:19,570 --> 00:57:21,503
Overlooking lake Washington,

1079
00:57:21,505 --> 00:57:22,571
Where he pulled a chair.

1080
00:57:22,573 --> 00:57:24,139
Up to a window.

1081
00:57:24,141 --> 00:57:27,509
Pressed the barrel of
a 20-Gauge shotgun to his head.

1082
00:57:27,511 --> 00:57:29,178
And pulled the trigger.

1083
00:57:33,750 --> 00:57:35,083
Imagine, though.

1084
00:57:35,085 --> 00:57:38,387
I mean, not to be a total buzz kill, but,

1085
00:57:38,389 --> 00:57:40,689
Imagine how many dicks
have been inside her.

1086
00:57:41,925 --> 00:57:43,759
What?

1087
00:57:43,761 --> 00:57:46,228
That pervert at
the Dan d. Fine.

1088
00:57:46,230 --> 00:57:47,896
Said the girl who stole those shoes.

1089
00:57:47,898 --> 00:57:49,598
Worked there for 11 months.

1090
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:53,268
11 months, Jack.

1091
00:57:53,270 --> 00:57:56,038
That's like... it's
like 4 dicks a day.

1092
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:58,106
And, you know, I'm being conservative.

1093
00:57:58,108 --> 00:58:01,376
All right, and they must've
worked, like, 6-day weeks.

1094
00:58:01,378 --> 00:58:06,381
6 times 4 is 24, 11 months is 44 weeks,

1095
00:58:06,383 --> 00:58:08,016
So, 44 times 24.

1096
00:58:08,018 --> 00:58:10,519
Is 1,056.

1097
00:58:13,022 --> 00:58:16,391
1,056 dicks!

1098
00:58:19,662 --> 00:58:23,599
1,056 dicks, Jack!

1099
00:58:23,601 --> 00:58:24,600
Pop quiz.

1100
00:58:24,602 --> 00:58:25,400
No.

1101
00:58:25,402 --> 00:58:26,401
Come on, it's a quick one.

1102
00:58:26,403 --> 00:58:27,536
No.

1103
00:58:27,538 --> 00:58:28,637
Come on.
No.

1104
00:58:33,710 --> 00:58:35,244
Go.

1105
00:58:35,246 --> 00:58:39,248
What is 1,056 dicks?

1106
00:58:40,650 --> 00:58:43,785
A lot of dicks.

1107
00:58:43,787 --> 00:58:46,588
Beep! Perfect score.

1108
00:58:46,590 --> 00:58:47,590
Gold star.

1109
00:58:48,691 --> 00:58:51,226
We haven't even begun
calculating blow jobs.

1110
00:58:53,997 --> 00:58:55,697
"E?"

1111
00:58:57,634 --> 00:59:00,536
Obviously, the kid doesn't like
being stared at and made fun of,

1112
00:59:00,538 --> 00:59:03,171
So maybe she should stop
charging people to look at him.

1113
00:59:03,173 --> 00:59:05,807
Maybe then he could have a peaceful life.

1114
00:59:11,581 --> 00:59:12,681
What?

1115
00:59:15,084 --> 00:59:16,351
Nothing.

1116
00:59:19,188 --> 00:59:20,622
God!

1117
00:59:21,891 --> 00:59:25,460
2... 3... 4...

1118
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:31,300
Shit!

1119
00:59:34,103 --> 00:59:37,205
When worlds collide.

1120
00:59:37,207 --> 00:59:39,808
I worship the concept.

1121
00:59:39,810 --> 00:59:41,944
Hey!
What's up, Jack?

1122
00:59:41,946 --> 00:59:43,078
What are you doing here?

1123
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:46,281
Tony Gomez
was a no-show!

1124
00:59:46,283 --> 00:59:48,584
I'm now officially
hitchhiking to Seattle.

1125
00:59:48,586 --> 00:59:51,720
Dude, what are you going
up there for anyways?

1126
00:59:57,794 --> 00:59:59,962
A friend of mine died.

1127
00:59:59,964 --> 01:00:01,897
A fucked up freak named Jimmy Deangelo.

1128
01:00:01,899 --> 01:00:04,099
And he left me his business.

1129
01:00:04,101 --> 01:00:06,234
Got insane in the brain one night.

1130
01:00:06,236 --> 01:00:07,703
And suicide-pacted
with this other kid.

1131
01:00:07,705 --> 01:00:09,705
Way too much Jack Daniels, mescaline,

1132
01:00:09,707 --> 01:00:10,772
And ozzy Osbourne.

1133
01:00:10,774 --> 01:00:13,976
"Backward masking,
suicide is good."

1134
01:00:13,978 --> 01:00:16,378
Blah, blah, blah.
Blah, blah.

1135
01:00:16,380 --> 01:00:17,746
Boom!

1136
01:00:17,748 --> 01:00:19,748
Shotgun to the face in the playground.

1137
01:00:19,750 --> 01:00:21,216
The other kid died,

1138
01:00:21,218 --> 01:00:24,119
But Jim hung on.

1139
01:00:25,788 --> 01:00:27,623
They had to do some major surgery,

1140
01:00:27,625 --> 01:00:29,424
On account of most of his face was gone.

1141
01:00:29,426 --> 01:00:33,095
They actually grafted some
of his ass up to his face.

1142
01:00:33,097 --> 01:00:35,297
But Jim had a really hairy ass,

1143
01:00:35,299 --> 01:00:36,431
So he has had to shave his forehead.

1144
01:00:36,433 --> 01:00:38,233
It was a bad scene.

1145
01:00:38,235 --> 01:00:42,137
And he drooled like a motherfucker.

1146
01:00:42,139 --> 01:00:43,705
And that's what eventually did him in.

1147
01:00:43,707 --> 01:00:46,441
Cause, check it out,
Jim didn't mind being ugly.

1148
01:00:46,443 --> 01:00:49,678
And having the hairy
forehead and no teeth.

1149
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:52,314
But goddamn it, he couldn't
take the drooling.

1150
01:00:53,583 --> 01:00:56,051
So one night he gobbled
too many sleeping pills,

1151
01:00:56,053 --> 01:00:57,753
And he did the job right.

1152
01:01:05,728 --> 01:01:06,762
Anyway!

1153
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:21,476
How come they call you pilot, anyways?

1154
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:25,347
My mother fucked an airline pilot,

1155
01:01:25,349 --> 01:01:26,381
Only she never knew his name.

1156
01:01:26,383 --> 01:01:29,151
So she called me pilot.

1157
01:01:29,153 --> 01:01:31,053
Good thing he a wasn't bulimic.

1158
01:01:31,055 --> 01:01:33,422
Otherwise, your name would be puke.

1159
01:01:35,992 --> 01:01:37,592
A field!

1160
01:01:37,594 --> 01:01:39,561
We need a field!

1161
01:01:39,563 --> 01:01:42,431
A field in which to frolic!

1162
01:01:58,915 --> 01:02:01,216
How's your head?

1163
01:02:04,587 --> 01:02:07,456
Good.

1164
01:02:07,458 --> 01:02:08,824
Good.

1165
01:02:17,233 --> 01:02:18,900
What?

1166
01:02:30,446 --> 01:02:31,980
OK.

1167
01:02:38,755 --> 01:02:40,388
We found the shoes.

1168
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:45,827
You went through my shit?

1169
01:02:45,829 --> 01:02:46,995
No.

1170
01:02:46,997 --> 01:02:48,930
The bag, it was open,

1171
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:52,567
A little bit.

1172
01:02:55,671 --> 01:02:58,406
So what's your point, exactly?

1173
01:03:00,076 --> 01:03:05,347
We were there,
at the Dan d. Fine.

1174
01:03:05,349 --> 01:03:07,415
We heard about the shoes.

1175
01:03:32,241 --> 01:03:35,610
A girlfriend and I went to Los Angeles.

1176
01:03:37,446 --> 01:03:39,381
To become actresses.

1177
01:03:44,020 --> 01:03:46,087
Yeah, it didn't work out.

1178
01:03:47,657 --> 01:03:50,458
I don't think I had any talent.

1179
01:03:50,460 --> 01:03:52,460
So, after a few years, I said, "fuck it,".

1180
01:03:52,462 --> 01:03:55,964
And was heading back home.

1181
01:03:58,100 --> 01:03:59,367
But I stopped in Vegas.

1182
01:03:59,369 --> 01:04:06,208
Where a pit boss comped
me a meal and a room.

1183
01:04:06,210 --> 01:04:07,475
And asked if I'd...

1184
01:04:09,579 --> 01:04:12,814
Escort some friend of his,
some Texas high roller,

1185
01:04:12,816 --> 01:04:14,883
You know, and sit at the tables with him,

1186
01:04:14,885 --> 01:04:17,786
Let him rub my thigh for good luck.

1187
01:04:20,923 --> 01:04:21,990
So...

1188
01:04:25,795 --> 01:04:26,995
I did it.

1189
01:04:29,799 --> 01:04:32,334
The next morning, I woke up alone.

1190
01:04:32,336 --> 01:04:34,369
With an envelope on the nightstand.

1191
01:04:34,371 --> 01:04:36,471
Filled with hundreds.

1192
01:04:36,473 --> 01:04:41,076
Within a couple of weeks,
I was at the Dan d. Fine.

1193
01:04:44,580 --> 01:04:46,715
But what about the shoes?

1194
01:04:50,086 --> 01:04:51,786
I don't know.

1195
01:04:51,788 --> 01:04:54,589
Just some symbolic gesture that,

1196
01:04:54,591 --> 01:04:56,958
At the time, seemed epic,

1197
01:04:56,960 --> 01:05:01,730
But now only seems stupid.

1198
01:05:04,300 --> 01:05:07,569
So, what are you going to do next?

1199
01:05:09,272 --> 01:05:10,472
I don't know.

1200
01:05:10,474 --> 01:05:12,807
What do you think I should do?

1201
01:05:12,809 --> 01:05:14,542
Got any ideas?

1202
01:05:19,115 --> 01:05:20,815
Anything but home.

1203
01:05:32,828 --> 01:05:33,828
All right.

1204
01:05:35,598 --> 01:05:37,899
The "so what" factor is...

1205
01:05:40,970 --> 01:05:42,203
Huge.

1206
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:44,940
The unlove...

1207
01:05:47,209 --> 01:05:49,978
At the end of the day,

1208
01:05:49,980 --> 01:05:53,415
Shit, you can see the merit in
actually fellating the pistol,

1209
01:05:53,417 --> 01:05:56,952
Because no matter what,

1210
01:05:58,054 --> 01:05:59,587
No matter how much money you make,

1211
01:05:59,589 --> 01:06:02,924
No matter how many gowns you bone,

1212
01:06:04,527 --> 01:06:05,760
No matter how many times you groove.

1213
01:06:05,762 --> 01:06:09,831
Like nobody ever grooved before...

1214
01:06:12,101 --> 01:06:13,935
In 100 years or so...

1215
01:06:15,504 --> 01:06:17,105
You're dust.

1216
01:06:19,208 --> 01:06:20,709
Crumbling soot in a pine box.

1217
01:06:20,711 --> 01:06:23,111
That our loved ones went all out for.

1218
01:06:23,113 --> 01:06:24,713
So that you could be...

1219
01:06:27,850 --> 01:06:30,485
Crumbling soot in a pine box...

1220
01:06:32,388 --> 01:06:34,856
In a j.C. Penney suit no less.

1221
01:06:34,858 --> 01:06:36,658
And why?

1222
01:06:36,660 --> 01:06:38,526
Because we never wore them in life,

1223
01:06:38,528 --> 01:06:39,828
So they just figure,
"what the fuck?"

1224
01:06:39,830 --> 01:06:42,364
And they stick us in the cheapo one.

1225
01:06:42,366 --> 01:06:45,266
Better than the concert t-shirts
and the ripped-up jeans.

1226
01:06:45,268 --> 01:06:46,901
You wore in life,

1227
01:06:46,903 --> 01:06:50,205
And what the fuck would he know
about giorgio Armani, anyway?

1228
01:06:50,207 --> 01:06:53,742
Johnny the fox!

1229
01:06:53,744 --> 01:06:59,347
You're one daffy
in-vi-di-dual.

1230
01:06:59,349 --> 01:07:00,949
In-vi-di-dual?

1231
01:07:02,885 --> 01:07:04,219
Yes, sir.

1232
01:07:08,424 --> 01:07:10,191
J.C. Penney!

1233
01:07:11,494 --> 01:07:13,728
Even a freak don't deserve to go down.

1234
01:07:13,730 --> 01:07:16,164
In no fucking
j.C. Penney!

1235
01:07:17,266 --> 01:07:20,001
Even a goddamn freak!

1236
01:07:36,886 --> 01:07:37,886
Slower.

1237
01:07:37,888 --> 01:07:39,821
Slower.

1238
01:07:43,359 --> 01:07:44,959
Like this?

1239
01:09:36,972 --> 01:09:40,642
Hey, you wanna give me
a ride back to the Murrays'?

1240
01:09:40,644 --> 01:09:42,810
I don't think I can drive.

1241
01:09:51,720 --> 01:09:53,988
So, clearly, you hit that last night.

1242
01:09:56,392 --> 01:09:57,392
Yeah.

1243
01:09:57,394 --> 01:10:00,795
What was it like?

1244
01:10:00,797 --> 01:10:06,201
It was, it was good.

1245
01:10:06,203 --> 01:10:08,636
You tell her you knew?

1246
01:10:08,638 --> 01:10:11,940
Yeah. She was cool.

1247
01:10:19,448 --> 01:10:20,949
You came, didn't you?

1248
01:10:42,638 --> 01:10:44,339
Mrs. Murray,
what's going on?

1249
01:10:45,407 --> 01:10:46,975
Police won't come.

1250
01:10:46,977 --> 01:10:48,543
Had trouble before.

1251
01:10:48,545 --> 01:10:52,780
They say you want to charge
folks money to see your oddity,

1252
01:10:52,782 --> 01:10:54,616
Then you got to expect trouble.

1253
01:10:54,618 --> 01:10:55,817
What kind of trouble?

1254
01:10:55,819 --> 01:10:58,286
So they won't make the trip anymore.

1255
01:10:58,288 --> 01:11:01,489
You just got to wait
for the trouble to go away.

1256
01:11:08,231 --> 01:11:09,231
Dude, drink it.

1257
01:11:10,967 --> 01:11:12,900
Alligator boy!

1258
01:11:12,902 --> 01:11:14,602
What's going on, guys?

1259
01:11:14,604 --> 01:11:17,839
Hey, meet Desmond, the alligator boy.

1260
01:11:17,841 --> 01:11:19,707
Desmond's learning to party.

1261
01:11:19,709 --> 01:11:20,908
Beer?

1262
01:11:21,510 --> 01:11:22,710
No, thanks.

1263
01:11:22,712 --> 01:11:24,412
Maybe you guys should leave him alone.

1264
01:11:24,414 --> 01:11:25,680
How's that?

1265
01:11:25,682 --> 01:11:27,548
I said maybe you should leave him alone.

1266
01:11:27,550 --> 01:11:28,616
Who are you, his mama?

1267
01:11:28,618 --> 01:11:30,985
No, no, it can't be his mama.

1268
01:11:30,987 --> 01:11:32,320
His mama's in the house,

1269
01:11:32,322 --> 01:11:34,088
Crying into her Bible.

1270
01:11:34,090 --> 01:11:36,591
Maybe this is the boyfriend.

1271
01:11:36,593 --> 01:11:38,926
You the boyfriend?

1272
01:11:38,928 --> 01:11:40,762
You like alligator dick?

1273
01:11:40,764 --> 01:11:43,031
You like to suck it?

1274
01:11:43,033 --> 01:11:46,901
Yo, shanks, who is this
strong, silent type?

1275
01:11:46,903 --> 01:11:48,670
Is this Clint Eastwood?

1276
01:11:48,672 --> 01:11:52,573
No, man, I think that's Steve McQueen!

1277
01:11:52,575 --> 01:11:53,875
I think you're both wrong.

1278
01:11:53,877 --> 01:11:57,445
This is Jack Hayes, the god of fuck.

1279
01:11:57,447 --> 01:12:00,982
The god of fuck?
Is that what they call you?

1280
01:12:00,984 --> 01:12:02,650
The god of fuck?

1281
01:12:02,652 --> 01:12:03,985
Tell me something.

1282
01:12:03,987 --> 01:12:06,020
Do you like to get fucked?

1283
01:12:11,393 --> 01:12:14,095
Sorry about that, Clint.

1284
01:12:14,097 --> 01:12:17,965
Hey, shanks, check this out!

1285
01:12:56,372 --> 01:12:57,271
Hey, you OK?

1286
01:12:57,273 --> 01:12:58,439
I'm all right.

1287
01:13:01,076 --> 01:13:02,510
Hey, shanks,

1288
01:13:02,512 --> 01:13:05,446
Welcome to the human race, motherfucker!

1289
01:13:07,583 --> 01:13:08,583
Come here...

1290
01:13:08,585 --> 01:13:10,051
I'm all right.

1291
01:13:21,196 --> 01:13:22,764
Leave you guys alone for a couple hours,

1292
01:13:22,766 --> 01:13:25,166
And the action just pours
like silver, doesn't it?

1293
01:13:28,904 --> 01:13:30,438
I can't tell you what a pleasure it was.

1294
01:13:30,440 --> 01:13:32,173
To meet you guys.

1295
01:13:33,575 --> 01:13:34,308
You take care.

1296
01:13:34,310 --> 01:13:34,842
Pilot!

1297
01:13:34,844 --> 01:13:36,878
All right, des?

1298
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:38,646
Pilot, let's go!

1299
01:13:41,350 --> 01:13:44,452
Those football turds were
just like Miranda's pandas.

1300
01:13:46,088 --> 01:13:48,189
The same type of dudes.

1301
01:13:49,925 --> 01:13:51,526
It was fucked.

1302
01:13:52,961 --> 01:13:55,596
I don't know, when you think about it,

1303
01:13:55,598 --> 01:13:58,266
It's like the world's
divided into 2 groups:

1304
01:13:58,268 --> 01:14:00,768
Pandas and alligator boys.

1305
01:14:00,770 --> 01:14:03,204
How much did you give her?

1306
01:14:05,274 --> 01:14:06,774
Not much.

1307
01:14:06,776 --> 01:14:08,409
Come on, pilot, how much?

1308
01:14:08,411 --> 01:14:10,912
Just a bit...
I'm not a rich guy.

1309
01:14:10,914 --> 01:14:12,313
Just a bit.

1310
01:14:12,315 --> 01:14:13,147
"A bit?"

1311
01:14:13,149 --> 01:14:16,184
And what is a bit?

1312
01:14:16,186 --> 01:14:18,019
Don't be so nosy, Jack.

1313
01:14:18,021 --> 01:14:21,122
Don't be such a fucking pussy, pilot.

1314
01:14:21,124 --> 01:14:22,623
Just tell me how much.

1315
01:14:22,625 --> 01:14:24,826
Just a bit, all right?

1316
01:14:24,828 --> 01:14:26,794
The kid's dying.

1317
01:14:26,796 --> 01:14:29,230
I gave them a bit.

1318
01:15:19,848 --> 01:15:20,815
No fucking way!

1319
01:15:20,817 --> 01:15:22,016
Pop quiz.
Go!

1320
01:15:22,018 --> 01:15:23,918
Number of possible highways and byways.

1321
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:25,453
In this fair nation that we could be on.

1322
01:15:25,455 --> 01:15:26,521
A gazillion!

1323
01:15:26,523 --> 01:15:27,688
Number of possible highways and byways.

1324
01:15:27,690 --> 01:15:28,789
In this fair nation.

1325
01:15:28,791 --> 01:15:29,590
That Miranda's pandas could be on?

1326
01:15:29,592 --> 01:15:31,025
A zillion!

1327
01:15:31,027 --> 01:15:32,026
Possible conclusion that could be drawn.

1328
01:15:32,028 --> 01:15:33,294
From them being on.

1329
01:15:33,296 --> 01:15:34,595
This very same highway, byway as us?

1330
01:15:34,597 --> 01:15:36,397
Start getting used to loose slippers.

1331
01:15:36,399 --> 01:15:39,066
Perfect score.
Gold star.

1332
01:15:39,068 --> 01:15:40,301
Anyone care to fill me in?

1333
01:15:44,773 --> 01:15:46,374
Now we're on the run.

1334
01:15:46,376 --> 01:15:48,709
I thought you were going
to Seattle for the scene.

1335
01:15:48,711 --> 01:15:51,412
Yeah, we thought we'd combine
checking out the scene.

1336
01:15:51,414 --> 01:15:52,713
With a little flight to safety,

1337
01:15:52,715 --> 01:15:54,448
Right, pi?

1338
01:15:54,450 --> 01:15:55,416
Right.

1339
01:15:55,418 --> 01:15:56,918
Hey, where we going now?

1340
01:15:56,920 --> 01:15:58,152
You want to check the maps?

1341
01:15:58,154 --> 01:16:00,588
This doesn't change anything.

1342
01:16:00,590 --> 01:16:03,424
We check out the place,
and then we split.

1343
01:16:03,426 --> 01:16:05,893
So, you still want to go to Seattle.

1344
01:16:05,895 --> 01:16:07,161
Yeah, dude, it'll be all right.

1345
01:16:07,163 --> 01:16:08,829
I mean, it's a huge place.

1346
01:16:08,831 --> 01:16:11,132
Bro, if it's so fucking huge,

1347
01:16:11,134 --> 01:16:14,068
Then how the fuck are
you going to find Amy carnes?

1348
01:16:16,271 --> 01:16:18,306
How do you know about that?

1349
01:16:20,042 --> 01:16:21,542
How do you know about that, dude?

1350
01:16:22,778 --> 01:16:24,979
Fucking dick.

1351
01:16:24,981 --> 01:16:26,247
What? Did fox tell you?

1352
01:16:26,249 --> 01:16:27,782
Dude, I heard you telling him.

1353
01:16:27,784 --> 01:16:29,250
What are you talking about?

1354
01:16:29,252 --> 01:16:30,685
This whole thing...

1355
01:16:30,687 --> 01:16:34,055
This whole stupid thing
was that so pilot could.

1356
01:16:34,057 --> 01:16:36,090
Chase after some fantasy girl.

1357
01:16:36,092 --> 01:16:37,391
Dude, we macked!

1358
01:16:37,393 --> 01:16:39,060
God...

1359
01:16:39,062 --> 01:16:40,962
These guys are cool!

1360
01:16:40,964 --> 01:16:43,064
They're going to Seattle!

1361
01:16:43,066 --> 01:16:44,498
And they're tripping to the tits!

1362
01:16:46,401 --> 01:16:50,071
What exactly are you on the run from?

1363
01:16:50,073 --> 01:16:51,739
Why don't you tell her, Jack?

1364
01:16:53,609 --> 01:16:55,576
Tell her, Jack!

1365
01:16:56,812 --> 01:16:58,112
I will.

1366
01:16:59,014 --> 01:17:01,015
I fucked a guy's wife,

1367
01:17:01,017 --> 01:17:03,384
And now he wants to break my feet.

1368
01:17:08,523 --> 01:17:11,125
And pilot doesn't seem to give a shit!

1369
01:17:11,127 --> 01:17:12,727
Why you getting so bent?

1370
01:17:12,729 --> 01:17:15,796
We had to leave, what's it matter where?

1371
01:17:15,798 --> 01:17:17,131
You're joking, right?
No!

1372
01:17:17,133 --> 01:17:18,199
No!
You're joking!

1373
01:17:18,201 --> 01:17:19,867
That's sort of pathetic, pilot!

1374
01:17:19,869 --> 01:17:21,402
What is?

1375
01:17:21,404 --> 01:17:23,471
As if it's any of your business.

1376
01:17:23,473 --> 01:17:26,107
He's your best friend,
and he's in trouble,

1377
01:17:26,109 --> 01:17:27,608
And you drag him up here on a lie.

1378
01:17:27,610 --> 01:17:29,043
I don't know, that's sort of pathetic.

1379
01:17:29,045 --> 01:17:30,177
In my book.

1380
01:17:30,179 --> 01:17:31,746
In your book?

1381
01:17:31,748 --> 01:17:32,580
Yep.

1382
01:17:32,582 --> 01:17:34,148
What's the title of that book?

1383
01:17:34,150 --> 01:17:36,150
Is it called, "give me 100 bucks",

1384
01:17:36,152 --> 01:17:37,385
And I'll suck
your dick?"

1385
01:17:37,387 --> 01:17:39,253
Because I think I read that one,

1386
01:17:39,255 --> 01:17:43,491
And it was, it was, lurid!

1387
01:17:43,493 --> 01:17:45,793
Are you kidding me, pilot?

1388
01:17:45,795 --> 01:17:47,094
Look at yourself!

1389
01:17:47,096 --> 01:17:49,163
You're a drug dealer!

1390
01:17:49,165 --> 01:17:50,398
Settle down with that, yoko.

1391
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:51,932
No, you settle down, Johnny.

1392
01:17:51,934 --> 01:17:52,967
You are no better than them.

1393
01:17:52,969 --> 01:17:54,068
In fact, you're worse.

1394
01:17:54,070 --> 01:17:55,336
You're old.

1395
01:17:55,338 --> 01:17:56,871
Time out. What happened
to the hooker.

1396
01:17:56,873 --> 01:17:58,539
With the heart of gold?
Didn't you read that chapter?

1397
01:17:58,541 --> 01:17:59,840
You know, maybe I am a drug dealer,

1398
01:17:59,842 --> 01:18:01,042
But I'll tell you this much,

1399
01:18:01,044 --> 01:18:02,309
When I tell my grandkiddies stories.

1400
01:18:02,311 --> 01:18:03,577
About my misspent youth,

1401
01:18:03,579 --> 01:18:05,379
I won't have to include the fact.

1402
01:18:05,381 --> 01:18:07,114
That I spread them wide for any Jake.

1403
01:18:07,116 --> 01:18:08,416
With a fistful of fifties!

1404
01:18:08,418 --> 01:18:10,151
That I saw more strange dick.

1405
01:18:10,153 --> 01:18:11,452
Than a draft board doctor.

1406
01:18:11,454 --> 01:18:12,586
Jack.

1407
01:18:12,588 --> 01:18:15,122
That I could be sold,
rolled, and cornholed.

1408
01:18:15,124 --> 01:18:17,425
For a negotiable price.

1409
01:18:28,070 --> 01:18:29,270
Congratulations.

1410
01:18:29,272 --> 01:18:30,771
You just became the sir Edmund Hillary.

1411
01:18:30,773 --> 01:18:31,806
Of assholes.

1412
01:18:31,808 --> 01:18:34,241
You climbed the highest mountain, pilot.

1413
01:18:34,243 --> 01:18:36,243
There's 5 good ones.

1414
01:18:45,153 --> 01:18:47,254
Whatever, right?

1415
01:18:48,890 --> 01:18:50,224
Yeah.

1416
01:18:50,826 --> 01:18:52,660
Whatever.

1417
01:18:54,296 --> 01:18:55,930
Hey, are you coming or not, man?

1418
01:18:56,732 --> 01:18:57,565
Come on, Johnny.

1419
01:18:57,567 --> 01:18:59,667
What about mom and dad?

1420
01:18:59,669 --> 01:19:00,901
Get in.

1421
01:26:25,480 --> 01:26:26,680
Jack, Jack, Jack.

1422
01:26:26,682 --> 01:26:28,949
Give it up, baby.

1423
01:26:35,423 --> 01:26:36,690
Cassie!

1424
01:26:43,565 --> 01:26:45,199
You're embarrassing yourself, baby.

1425
01:26:48,570 --> 01:26:49,903
Do you know what that means?

1426
01:26:51,806 --> 01:26:53,273
The game is over!

1427
01:26:53,275 --> 01:26:54,875
Fuck you up two times!

1428
01:26:56,678 --> 01:26:57,978
Come on!

1429
01:27:05,653 --> 01:27:06,887
That's what it's about!

1430
01:27:06,889 --> 01:27:09,356
Let's go! Come on!
Get down here!

1431
01:27:09,358 --> 01:27:11,325
Watch this!
Watch this!

1432
01:27:11,327 --> 01:27:11,892
Watch it!

1433
01:27:11,894 --> 01:27:14,261
Jack, I'm sorry.

1434
01:27:14,263 --> 01:27:15,295
Watch it!

1435
01:27:17,966 --> 01:27:19,066
Jack!

1436
01:27:21,236 --> 01:27:22,703
Jack!

1437
01:27:27,175 --> 01:27:28,275
Jack!

1438
01:27:36,050 --> 01:27:38,085
Next time keep it in your pants, Hayes,

1439
01:27:38,087 --> 01:27:39,753
Or we'll break that, too.

1440
01:27:41,122 --> 01:27:44,157
We'll call 911 from the car.

1441
01:27:44,159 --> 01:27:46,460
Hope you have insurance, Jack.

1442
01:27:46,462 --> 01:27:48,528
Adios, motherfucker.

1443
01:28:13,154 --> 01:28:14,454
Hey.

1444
01:28:16,691 --> 01:28:18,458
Hey.

1445
01:28:18,460 --> 01:28:20,927
How are you doing?

1446
01:28:20,929 --> 01:28:23,563
I've been better.

1447
01:28:29,804 --> 01:28:32,372
How about you?

1448
01:28:32,374 --> 01:28:33,407
OK.

1449
01:28:36,678 --> 01:28:38,945
That was kind of unreal, wasn't it?

1450
01:28:38,947 --> 01:28:40,514
Totally fucking gothic.

1451
01:28:40,516 --> 01:28:42,716
A grade-b horror flick.

1452
01:28:42,718 --> 01:28:46,253
Only thing fucking missing
is fucking Christopher Lee,

1453
01:28:46,255 --> 01:28:49,923
Peter cushing,
and John fucking carradine.

1454
01:28:49,925 --> 01:28:51,525
What's wrong with him?

1455
01:28:51,527 --> 01:28:53,827
I think he's
having re-entry problems.

1456
01:28:54,829 --> 01:28:56,830
Hey, kiddies.

1457
01:28:56,832 --> 01:28:59,166
Jack Hayes, you're awake.

1458
01:28:59,168 --> 01:29:00,867
How you feeling, brother?

1459
01:29:00,869 --> 01:29:02,469
Hey, man, I'm all right.

1460
01:29:04,605 --> 01:29:05,839
Jack...

1461
01:29:06,708 --> 01:29:08,842
Forget it.

1462
01:29:10,812 --> 01:29:12,279
Hey...

1463
01:29:12,281 --> 01:29:14,481
Did you find her?

1464
01:29:23,791 --> 01:29:25,258
What?

1465
01:29:30,398 --> 01:29:31,765
I'm sorry, man.

1466
01:29:31,767 --> 01:29:32,766
Hey, man.

1467
01:29:32,768 --> 01:29:35,068
It's OK.

1468
01:29:35,070 --> 01:29:38,038
It's OK.
It's OK.

1469
01:29:39,741 --> 01:29:41,408
Hey...

1470
01:29:43,077 --> 01:29:45,545
Who the hell needs feet anyway?

1471
01:30:01,229 --> 01:30:02,396
I got to get out of here.

1472
01:30:03,598 --> 01:30:05,065
What?

1473
01:30:05,067 --> 01:30:09,136
Yeah, I got to get back.
I got a girl in Vegas.

1474
01:30:10,238 --> 01:30:12,005
You feeling ready for her?

1475
01:30:14,342 --> 01:30:16,176
Kind of miss her.

1476
01:30:17,979 --> 01:30:20,747
Can I take the monte?

1477
01:30:20,749 --> 01:30:22,883
Keep it.

1478
01:30:22,885 --> 01:30:25,485
Maybe you shouldn't drive.

1479
01:30:26,721 --> 01:30:28,021
Please.

1480
01:30:30,057 --> 01:30:32,325
You guys are gonna hang?

1481
01:30:34,429 --> 01:30:35,429
Yeah.

1482
01:30:36,364 --> 01:30:38,298
I think we're gonna hang for a while.

1483
01:30:44,005 --> 01:30:45,238
I like it.

1484
01:30:46,274 --> 01:30:48,975
Hit the road, flee for your life.

1485
01:30:48,977 --> 01:30:52,312
Meet a doll who's got
"once in a lifetime".

1486
01:30:52,314 --> 01:30:55,081
And "girl of my dreams"
and "reason to believe".

1487
01:30:55,083 --> 01:30:59,085
Written all over her
like so much graffiti.

1488
01:31:00,555 --> 01:31:02,823
Could only happen to the god of fuck.

1489
01:31:02,825 --> 01:31:04,458
That's me.

1490
01:31:06,427 --> 01:31:07,694
Pop quiz.

1491
01:31:08,563 --> 01:31:09,963
Go.

1492
01:31:09,965 --> 01:31:13,667
How much I owe you for helping me out?

1493
01:31:13,669 --> 01:31:15,335
A gazillion.

1494
01:31:15,337 --> 01:31:18,572
Who's the major
old-school happener?

1495
01:31:18,574 --> 01:31:20,207
Pilot.

1496
01:31:20,209 --> 01:31:23,243
How much longer are we a team?

1497
01:31:25,646 --> 01:31:26,980
Forever.

1498
01:31:28,850 --> 01:31:31,251
Beep. Perfect score.

1499
01:31:33,321 --> 01:31:34,721
Gold star.

1500
01:31:39,260 --> 01:31:40,260
Late.

1501
01:31:45,299 --> 01:31:46,366
Late.
