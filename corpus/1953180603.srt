We are proud of it. It's older than the country.
Has a few hundred years.

Was built in 1692 by Jonathan Horn,

35
00:07:33,923 --> 00:07:36,664
one of the founders of our city.

36
00:07:37,504 --> 00:07:39,746
Of course, that has been remodeled over the years
.

37
00:07:39,747 --> 00:07:43,413
Re, left the session and sheriff
60 years from now.

- God, looks like a war of tissue.

00:07:50,742 --> 00:07:52,645
Belongs to each and sheriff.

- Stone you have said?
- What kind of stones?

42
00:07:58,217 --> 00:08:01,015
McSwain, did you work?

43
00:08:02,427 --> 00:08:06,253
Acordaþi  There's too much attention.
It's very healthy to the head.

44
00:08:06,254 --> 00:08:08,488
But, do the job.

45
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:15,264
Keys are here. That area and information about
. Parks, restaurants and more.

46
00:08:17,265 --> 00:08:21,870
There's a row of keys, but...
I left the office.

- A to bring you the latest.
- Everything is OK. Do not rush.

48
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:29,813
Now you will leave. And sheriff,

49
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:33,043
I am sure that your assistant will do

00:08:33,796 --> 00:08:36,174
And if you need anything, feel free to contact me

51
00:08:36,459 --> 00:08:39,846
- Mr Mayor, thank you for everything.
- With pleasure.

52
00:08:45,176 --> 00:08:46,603
This place is creepy.

53
00:08:55,404 --> 00:08:57,381
"Wow"... it's right place and that's great.

54
00:08:57,382 --> 00:08:59,943
Anyway, I'll sit too much.

55
00:09:00,077 --> 00:09:03,422
- Seems to be haunted.
- Kyle, do not start again.

56
00:09:03,457 --> 00:09:05,443
I think you are too big
ghost stories.

57
00:09:05,444 --> 00:09:07,060
But that's not a ghost story
.

58
00:09:07,095 --> 00:09:10,569
- Yes, people were omorâþi here.
- It's an urban legend.

59
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:15,170
It's a great house.
Attract large houses ghost stories.

60
00:09:15,205 --> 00:09:17,824
- Especially in Salem.
- We got free.

61
00:09:17,825 --> 00:09:21,739
's Old house, large and free.
And for that, are willing to accept any.

62
00:09:21,774 --> 00:09:24,465
- Choose your room.

63
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,954
- I think you need help.
- I.

64
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:23,504
Where's my baseball bat?

65
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:42,533
- Sorry.
- What are you doing up here?

66
00:12:42,534 --> 00:12:45,345
- I think you hit the window.
- I think your jokes and...

67
00:12:45,954 --> 00:12:49,069
Wayne! Bird!

68
00:12:52,049 --> 00:12:53,836
- Stuff that cut me.
- Good.

69
00:12:53,837 --> 00:12:55,895
- A sharp glass I entered.
- Okay.

70
00:12:56,565 --> 00:12:58,642
Should be cleaned in order not to infect
, OK?

71
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:01,545
Off. Cleans
first.

72
00:14:02,614 --> 00:14:04,499
- Really?
- How?

73
00:14:06,112 --> 00:14:08,643
- In witchcraft.
- I.

74
00:14:09,951 --> 00:14:12,804
- I think.
- Do you?

75
00:14:17,316 --> 00:14:20,330
Because you think I do now
spells.

76
00:14:24,308 --> 00:14:28,383
- Where'd you put it?
- Do you have any objection?

77
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:31,567
No, no... I just...

78
00:14:32,706 --> 00:14:34,411
Can you?

79
00:14:35,412 --> 00:14:38,774
I'm currently in a perfect form
, Mrs Downs.

80
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,182
At least,
as well as I ever was.

81
00:14:42,783 --> 00:14:47,270
What would you do your time and your shower to the ALA,
for lost time.

82
00:14:48,407 --> 00:14:51,783
- Give me five minutes or less.
- Speak of the shower.

83
00:14:51,784 --> 00:14:53,354
I think that is my shower.

84
00:14:59,411 --> 00:15:03,469
- What's this?
- I got it for about 9 months.

85
00:15:03,983 --> 00:15:05,814
Swear.

86
00:15:07,515 --> 00:15:09,132
I would be better not minds,
and sheriff.

87
00:15:10,533 --> 00:15:12,503
I do not hear, is not it?

88
00:15:14,736 --> 00:15:17,645
Old house has walls, children!

89
00:15:26,386 --> 00:15:29,150
- Wayne, can come a little?
- What happened?

90
00:15:29,151 --> 00:15:31,530
Baby, light flashing here.

91
00:15:32,268 --> 00:15:34,578
Perhaps his light.

Alli...

108
00:21:48,331 --> 00:21:51,071
Good! Forget that you're up.

109
00:21:51,373 --> 00:21:55,281
- Why did you let it idle?
- Not you like?

110
00:21:55,486 --> 00:21:58,562
- Next time I wake you.
- That's how I'll do.

- Where are the children?
- Top, do not talk to each other.

112
00:22:02,713 --> 00:22:04,454
There's something new.

What about you?
Were you nervous about the whole night.

You go to office today?

119
00:22:24,996 --> 00:22:27,720
Not. The mayor said she can
I stay a few days.

120
00:22:29,055 --> 00:22:31,536
Why do I feel that to try and
eviþi this?

Why did and do that?

122

Damn...

148
00:29:25,873 --> 00:29:29,202
I told them not to sirens and lights,
as to not scare anyone.

149
00:29:30,695 --> 00:29:34,629
Do not worry. Will find out sooner or later
. Come to make acquainted.

150
00:29:37,444 --> 00:29:39,350
What is happening?

151
00:29:41,006 --> 00:29:44,330
McSwain, gardener... and he hung himself.

152
00:29:45,623 --> 00:29:47,224
O God.

Do not worry.
You want to prepare a coffee?

00:30:01,372 --> 00:30:03,811
No, no, do not bother.
Thank you.

158
00:30:03,812 --> 00:30:07,397
Honey, go to bed, you must
a few minutes talking with Mike.

159
00:30:09,598 --> 00:30:12,968
- Are you OK?
- Yes, children are worried.

160
00:30:13,003 --> 00:30:17,489
Do not we tell the children...
Tell them that we find a replacement.

161
00:30:18,524 --> 00:30:22,156
- Are you OK?
- Yes, well.

162
00:30:25,791 --> 00:30:27,271

00:30:45,214 --> 00:30:47,462
I do not know.

166
00:30:54,616 --> 00:30:57,853
Lighters, but no smoking, no?
When you gave up?

167
00:30:59,088 --> 00:31:00,955
About nine months ago.

168
00:31:00,956 --> 00:31:02,889
Yes, and I wanted to quit, but...

169
00:31:03,924 --> 00:31:06,176
Sometimes
I do not think this is something bad.

170
00:31:07,633 --> 00:31:10,853
I hope I have not created any problem
by awakening your wife.

171
00:31:11,575 --> 00:31:14,630
Not about it...
But the children.

172
00:31:15,931 --> 00:31:17,993
They believe that this house is haunted.

173
00:31:19,777 --> 00:31:24,407
Can not execute 19 people for witchcraft,

174
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:26,999
without creating a certain reputation.

175
00:31:28,009 --> 00:31:30,911
People say all kinds of stories.

176
00:31:31,912 --> 00:31:34,187
Between  American revolution and civil war
,

177
00:31:34,188 --> 00:31:38,579
will be hard to find yourself in a corner of this region without a story
bloody.

178
00:31:44,195 --> 00:31:47,541
- Ours began to be more...
- Policeman?

179
00:31:48,768 --> 00:31:51,780
Yes... It's a good word:
"policeman".

180
00:31:56,152 --> 00:32:00,005
What did they hear?
Children.

181
00:32:00,306 --> 00:32:03,014
Cause 16 years ago,
a guy crazy there.

182
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:05,749
Cause and killed the whole family.

183
00:32:06,475 --> 00:32:08,145
Yes, it's the same with all young people.

184
00:32:08,146 --> 00:32:13,074
Also catch him a few months...

185
00:32:13,075 --> 00:32:14,904
Especially around Halloween...

186
00:32:14,905 --> 00:32:17,978
They come here to steal and
shows the house and drink beer... Something like that.

187
00:32:19,579 --> 00:32:21,925
I feel that not to come here
.

188
00:32:21,926 --> 00:32:23,305
You would see the sheriff.

189
00:32:25,879 --> 00:32:31,800
The truth is that...  then there were all sorts of stories
horrible with this house Corwin.

190
00:32:34,561 --> 00:32:38,149
But you know...
most of them are just stories.

191
00:32:39,246 --> 00:32:41,722
Most of them?

192
00:32:43,435 --> 00:32:44,860
Would you show you something?

193
00:33:20,473 --> 00:33:23,232
Here was broken granite.

194
00:33:25,196 --> 00:33:28,289
There are rumors that there were 18 Moroni.

195
00:33:29,458 --> 00:33:32,023
18 what...?

196
00:33:33,624 --> 00:33:35,779
Stand on the old site of the Corwin House.

197
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:39,253
It is said that they were
and execute îngropaþi here.

198
00:33:42,156 --> 00:33:45,067
THI not worry. I think they were moved long
families.

199
00:33:48,751 --> 00:33:52,148
Yes... Thank you for coming so late,
Mike.

200
00:33:53,349 --> 00:33:55,662
Like I said...
a beginning and not the service steps.

201
00:33:55,663 --> 00:33:56,663
Yes...

202
00:33:58,037 --> 00:34:00,086
Go and rest your fish.
Probably, we will see tomorrow.

203
00:34:00,587 --> 00:34:03,166
Welcome , and sheriff.
I pick you up tomorrow morning with the machine.

204
00:34:03,167 --> 00:34:04,167
Good.

205
00:34:05,568 --> 00:34:10,600
Hey, Mike... Salem witches were executed as
?

206
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:20,207
Were hanged...
All 19.

207

00:39:26,688 --> 00:39:29,836
Baby, it's adaptation.
Is the first night in the house. It's always hard.

225
00:39:29,977 --> 00:39:32,883
I'm not a child, Mom.
I can adapt anywhere.

226
00:39:33,382 --> 00:39:36,249

Welcome .. Remember what I thought.

232
00:40:01,228 --> 00:40:05,680
After you finish breakfast, we walk through town

00:40:05,715 --> 00:40:08,721

00:41:05,908 --> 00:41:09,309
Having seen the McSwain and A. ..
-Thi should be given a reason.

243
00:41:11,542 --> 00:41:13,840

00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:18,043
I needed veterans hospital.

255
00:43:32,948 --> 00:43:34,450

267
00:44:22,307 --> 00:44:23,307
I'm in the car.

268
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:27,818
Wayne.

269
00:44:49,821 --> 00:44:52,258
Slow down, asshole.

270
00:45:13,619 --> 00:45:17,651
Sheriff And Downs,
I'm glad to see you again so soon.

271
00:45:19,329 --> 00:45:23,610
- Can we talk?
- Of course. To take place.

272
00:45:27,042 --> 00:45:30,418
Obviously, you're a little bit tense.

273
00:45:30,419 --> 00:45:34,003
It's something that trouble you?
E McSwain?

274
00:45:35,122 --> 00:45:38,966
Aid and Goodwyn sheriff told me, of course.
It's a tragedy.

275
00:45:39,001 --> 00:45:41,544
It's not the McSwain.

276
00:45:43,399 --> 00:45:46,274
It's the stories about crimes
tile that happened in the House Corwin.

277
00:45:46,275 --> 00:45:49,986
I want to know if true.
Are true?

278
00:45:49,987 --> 00:45:51,552
Yes.

279
00:45:52,152 --> 00:45:55,176
- Tell me what happened?
- His name was Underhill.

280
00:45:55,177 --> 00:45:59,418
And boy drowned in the bath, put a plastic bag over his head
his wife,

281
00:45:59,453 --> 00:46:01,751
and then thrown out the window,
falling in the yard.

282
00:46:02,383 --> 00:46:07,295
The only survived her daughter, who was scared to death
and the state of shock.

283
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:09,794
Later, after a year and it
suicide.

284
00:46:10,195 --> 00:46:11,608
Why it did something like this?

285
00:46:11,964 --> 00:46:17,383
And it took me a long time, but after one
I understand, the man was completely insane.

286
00:46:17,418 --> 00:46:22,075
It is said that almost immediately drove
and after becoming sheriff.

287
00:46:22,076 --> 00:46:26,005
Talk all day only to curse.

288
00:46:26,691 --> 00:46:30,806
- Man believed that this house is cursed.
- Why would have thought of something like this?

289
00:46:31,550 --> 00:46:33,301
Just as said, it was about...

290
00:46:33,302 --> 00:46:35,861
Why
he believed that this house is haunted?

291
00:46:36,086 --> 00:46:40,524
U and URELIT, and sheriff. I think a little overboard.

292
00:46:41,102 --> 00:46:43,770
Or maybe you made a military...

293
00:46:45,437 --> 00:46:47,848
I do not know exactly what the man thought.

294
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,773
Something like witch burned the property assignee.

295
00:46:50,774 --> 00:46:53,906
- Only a lunatic, I'm sure of it.
- Are you sure?

296
00:46:55,086 --> 00:46:57,593
The only evil that lived in the Corwin House

297
00:46:57,594 --> 00:47:00,421
threw himself out the window half a century ago.

298
00:47:01,746 --> 00:47:06,267
In addition, human arguments have nothing to base
.

299
00:47:06,268 --> 00:47:07,991
Just as Thi and Deputy said Goodwin,

300
00:47:07,992 --> 00:47:09,947
most execute many of those were exhumaþi
,

301
00:47:09,948 --> 00:47:11,394
and their bodies were buried by their families
.

302
00:47:13,403 --> 00:47:18,507
- The many, or all?
- Of course there documents.

303
00:48:19,029 --> 00:48:23,459
Are you OK there? O God...

Hello?

311
00:50:02,206 --> 00:50:04,970
Here is Mary Winston,
the historical society.

312
00:50:08,166 --> 00:50:10,370

313
00:50:15,971 --> 00:50:17,210

00:52:47,905 --> 00:52:50,888
I know, I know... Everything is OK.

318
00:52:51,397 --> 00:52:53,815
Everything is okay.

319
00:53:06,408 --> 00:53:09,333
- What are you doing, Mike?
- I went to take his machine McSwain.

320
00:53:09,334 --> 00:53:12,280
And
other things that need to go to the city.

321
00:53:12,281 --> 00:53:13,281
OK, and why you are here in May?

322
00:53:14,822 --> 00:53:20,214
I do not want my bag to me, but...
Carrie told me what happened to your daughter.

323
00:53:22,628 --> 00:53:27,605
- I knew that a matter to police.
- I learned...

324
00:53:28,087 --> 00:53:32,181
Everything okay with you?
When you told me last night...

325
00:53:32,714 --> 00:53:35,654
You talked about last night?
Let's talk about that, Mike.

326
00:53:35,689 --> 00:53:38,671
Let's talk about the crimes and that
you told me not at all.

327
00:53:38,872 --> 00:53:44,801
- What about them? You are just some stories.
- Stories and tile bodies not create true.

328
00:53:45,613 --> 00:53:48,424
- I understand... what do you mean?
- I went to see him in the primary.

329
00:53:49,175 --> 00:53:52,535
There is no record that the corpses were removed from the earth
.

330
00:53:53,837 --> 00:53:57,297
And  sheriff, come on, do not let
imagination to take hold on you.

331
00:53:57,360 --> 00:53:59,885
Yes... just tell me and your friend.

332
00:54:03,559 --> 00:54:06,012
Do you have a better place?

333
00:54:06,801 --> 00:54:08,522
Yes, I think.

334
00:54:18,518 --> 00:54:21,314
- Where were you? What is happening?
- What is Alli?

335
00:54:21,315 --> 00:54:24,787
E .. How do you think you scared her to death.
And me and Kyle we got scared.

336
00:54:25,303 --> 00:54:27,033
What is happening?

337
00:55:42,361 --> 00:55:45,679

338
00:56:35,838 --> 00:56:39,897
Jesus, Alli, arãþi terrible.

00:56:39,898 --> 00:56:42,715

Are you worried about the father?

360
00:58:13,334 --> 00:58:15,172
Now, he's a little stressed.

361
00:58:16,173 --> 00:58:19,814
You know a big change to
go back to work.

362
00:58:21,486 --> 00:58:24,108

My father shot a man.
His name was Cooper.

366
00:58:37,649 --> 00:58:40,342
It is one of the guys thought wicked,
but...

01:01:44,939 --> 01:01:48,125
Kyle, I thought him a ghost.
I want to hit you.

380
01:01:48,647 --> 01:01:51,213
- Well, you did.
- It was an accident! I swear.

381
01:01:51,248 --> 01:01:54,062
What about Alli, Wayne?
And that was all an accident?

382
01:01:54,097 --> 01:01:58,140
- I do not know, I saw something exaggerated.

383
01:01:58,386 --> 01:02:02,123
- I do not understand things.

384
01:02:02,124 --> 01:02:04,789

Go to your room!

Tile stories are true...
There is something in this house.

- What? House is haunted?
- Listen to me.

01:02:31,491 --> 01:02:33,673
- Not about that.
- Ba that it is.

393
01:02:33,708 --> 01:02:35,482
Since you share the

Why did you do that? What was Kyle was

Look... I never told Mike what happened
,

Well, that and want to do.
I want to take her children and to leave here.

- It's not safe.
- Yes, you're right.

410
01:03:27,055 --> 01:03:31,580
