COME ON.

117
00:09:01,701 --> 00:09:03,502
THIS IS NOT A JOKE.

118
00:09:03,503 --> 00:09:05,537

00:09:39,677 --> 00:09:41,911
FROM BEING RECALLED
BACK HERE TO D.C.

00:09:41,912 --> 00:09:42,779
- WHAT?

129
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:43,447
THEY CAN'T DO THAT.

NOT NOW.

131
00:09:44,316 --> 00:09:45,550
- OH, YES, THEY CAN.

132
00:09:45,551 --> 00:09:47,184
ESPECIALLY SINCE THE
COMMITTEE AND THE CHAIRMEN

133
00:09:47,185 --> 00:09:49,487
BOTH THINK YOU LACK THE
EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT

134
00:09:49,488 --> 00:09:50,722
YOUR THEORY.

135
00:09:50,723 --> 00:09:52,357
- DID YOU SHOW THEM
THE CAGE ENCLOSURES?

136
00:09:52,359 --> 00:09:54,259
- IT'S INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE.

137
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:57,363
THOSE STRUCTURES COULD
HOUSE JUST ABOUT ANYTHING.

138
00:09:57,364 --> 00:09:59,898
- LOOK, THERE IS SOMETHING
ALIVE AND BIG IN THERE.

139
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,468
I'M TELLING YA, I-I HEARD IT.

140
00:10:01,469 --> 00:10:04,270
- AND UNTIL YOU
HAVE VISIBLE PROOF

141
00:10:04,271 --> 00:10:06,339
NOBODY HERE IS
GONNA BUY IT.

142
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:07,874
- WHAT ABOUT THE
EYE IN THE SKY?

143
00:10:07,876 --> 00:10:09,243
- WELL, I PULLED UP THE
MOST RECENT COVERAGE

AND NOTHING.

- VACANT?

00:10:14,483 --> 00:10:15,916
- LOOK, I COUNTED AT LEAST
50 PEOPLE WALKING AROUND

148
00:10:15,918 --> 00:10:17,652
WHEN I WAS UP THERE
THE OTHER DAY.

149
00:10:17,653 --> 00:10:20,522
- BUT THEY'RE NOT THERE NOW.

150
00:10:20,523 --> 00:10:23,124
- MAN, I JUST
DON'T UNDERSTAND.

151
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:25,761
UH, DID YOU GET THE COORDINATES
FOR THE GROWTH FIELD?

152
00:10:25,763 --> 00:10:27,397

THAN PLEASED WHEN HE FINDS OUT

THE GROWTH HORMONE

157
00:10:34,439 --> 00:10:35,839
ON LIVING CREATURES.

158
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,842
- WHAT IF SOMEONE TIPPED HIM
OFF ABOUT OUR INVESTIGATION?

159
00:10:38,843 --> 00:10:40,277
WOULD THEY PULL THE PLUG?

160
00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:42,447
- NO, NO, DRAKE'S GOT WAY TOO
MUCH TIME AND MONEY INVESTED

161
00:10:42,448 --> 00:10:44,816
IN THIS THING TO
JUST SHUT UP SHOP NOW.

162
00:10:44,817 --> 00:10:47,452
- SO WHERE DID
THE PEOPLE GO?

163
00:10:47,454 --> 00:10:48,253
- I DON'T KNOW.

164
00:10:48,254 --> 00:10:49,722
THAT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION.

165
00:10:49,723 --> 00:10:51,356
- PAUL, I THINK YOU NEED
TO HEAD BACK UP THERE,

166
00:10:51,357 --> 00:10:53,859
TAKE A LOOK AROUND UP
CLOSE AND PERSONAL.

167
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:54,493
- YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

168
00:10:54,494 --> 00:10:55,528
I WILL.

169
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:56,996
BUT, NOT TODAY.

A WELL EARNED DAY OFF.

172
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:00,600

173
00:11:00,601 --> 00:11:01,635
WHERE YOU GOING?

174
00:11:01,636 --> 00:11:02,736
- I AM GOING FISHING.

175
00:11:02,737 --> 00:11:03,737
- FISHING?

176
00:11:03,739 --> 00:11:04,605
YOU'RE A WORKAHOLIC.

177
00:11:04,606 --> 00:11:06,006
YOU DON'T DO
STUFF LIKE THAT.

UGLY CLOTHES.

180

PICKED OUT SOMETHING VERY,

181
00:11:12,515 --> 00:11:16,452
VERY ATTRACTIVE AND I THINK THE
NATIVES WILL APPRECIATE IT.

182
00:11:16,453 --> 00:11:18,320
- DUDE, YOU'RE SCARING ME.

183
00:11:18,321 --> 00:11:19,721
- LOOK, I'LL
TALK TO YOU LATER.

184
00:11:19,723 --> 00:11:21,090
- GOODBYE.

185
00:11:47,588 --> 00:11:48,855
- WANSILLA LODGE,
WANSILLA LODGE,

186
00:11:48,856 --> 00:11:50,255
WHAT'S YOUR 20, CASSIDY?

187
00:11:50,257 --> 00:11:52,693
- HEY, DAD, I'M A QUARTER
MILE SOUTH OF FERN GROTTO.

188
00:11:52,694 --> 00:11:53,827
- YOU NEED TO DOCK.

189
00:11:53,828 --> 00:11:55,395
- WHY-- WHAT'S UP?

190
00:11:55,396 --> 00:11:56,830
- WHY YOU ALWAYS
ASKING QUESTIONS?

191
00:11:56,831 --> 00:11:58,465
JUST MEET ME THERE, OKAY?

192
00:11:58,467 --> 00:12:00,635
- SURE THING.

193
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:02,937
CRANKY FART.

194
00:12:46,955 --> 00:12:48,589
SO WHAT COULDN'T YOU
TELL ME OVER THE RADIO.

195
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:50,257
- WE GOT A CALL FROM THAT
NATURE PHOTOGRAPHER,

196
00:12:50,258 --> 00:12:51,959
HAMMOND, ABOUT AN HOUR AGO.

197
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,694
HE'S UP NEAR RAINBOW FALLS.

198
00:12:53,696 --> 00:12:55,530
- WELL, THAT'S HALF
WAY UP THE MOUNTAIN.

199
00:12:55,531 --> 00:12:57,398
SURPRISED HE EVEN GOT
CELL SERVICE UP THERE.

200
00:12:57,399 --> 00:12:59,000
- YEAH, HE'S GOT
SOME SATELLITE PHONE.

201
00:12:59,001 --> 00:13:00,569
IT WAS A LITTLE GARBLED.

202
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:02,037
BUT FROM WHAT I CAUGHT...

203
00:13:02,039 --> 00:13:03,873
HE FOUND SOMETHING STRANGE
FLOATING IN THE WATER.

204
00:13:03,874 --> 00:13:06,809
- WHAT?

205
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:09,178
- BUNCH OF CLOTHES STREWN
AROUND, COUPLE OF BACKPACKS,

206
00:13:09,179 --> 00:13:11,513
A MAN'S WALLET.

207
00:13:11,515 --> 00:13:13,817
THERE WERE BLOOD
STAINS ALL OVER 'EM.

208
00:13:13,818 --> 00:13:14,885
- THERE AREN'T ANY
ANIMALS UP THERE

209
00:13:14,886 --> 00:13:16,319
BIG ENOUGH TO
HARM ANYONE.

210
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,689
- MIGHT NOT BE
AN ANIMAL, CAS'.

211
00:13:18,691 --> 00:13:19,891
- YOU WANT ME TO
TAKE YOU UP RIVER?

212
00:13:19,892 --> 00:13:21,425
- NO, THESE OLD BONES
OF MINE WON'T MAKE IT

213
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:23,360
ONCE THE WATER
GETS SHALLOW.

214
00:13:23,361 --> 00:13:25,730
I GOT JAKE OVER AT SAFARI
GONNA CHOPPER ME UP

215
00:13:25,732 --> 00:13:26,932
FIRST THING IN THE MORNING.

216
00:13:26,933 --> 00:13:27,933
- ALL RIGHT, I'LL GO
UP AND TAKE A LOOK.

217
00:13:27,934 --> 00:13:28,934
- NO, YOU WON'T.

218
00:13:28,935 --> 00:13:30,335
NOT WITHOUT BACKUP.

219
00:13:30,336 --> 00:13:31,236
I JUST WANT YOU TO
KEEP YOUR EYE OUT

220
00:13:31,237 --> 00:13:32,671
WHILE YOU PATROL
THE BANKS.

221
00:13:32,672 --> 00:13:34,707
WATCH FOR
ANYTHING STRANGE.

222
00:13:40,547 --> 00:13:42,582
- YOU MEAN LIKE THAT?

223
00:13:42,584 --> 00:13:44,952
- THOSE SURE
AIN'T TOUR CHOPPERS.

224
00:13:44,953 --> 00:13:48,723
- THEY'RE HEADING IN THE
SAME DIRECTION YOU ARE, DAD.

225
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:02,080
- IT'S TIME TO EARN OUR PAY.

226
00:14:02,081 --> 00:14:04,249
YOU ALL LOCK AND LOAD.

227
00:14:07,253 --> 00:14:10,522
ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
YOU READY TO MOVE OUT.

228
00:14:10,523 --> 00:14:11,856
- HURRAH.

229
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,254
- WE GOT SOMETHING.

230
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:21,559
- WAIT, WAIT, DON'T SHOOT.

231
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,460
DON'T SHOOT.

232
00:15:22,461 --> 00:15:23,494
THANK GOD.

233
00:15:23,495 --> 00:15:24,661
DRAKE INDUSTRY SENT
YOU, DIDN'T THEY?

234
00:15:24,662 --> 00:15:25,696
- THAT'S RIGHT.

235
00:15:25,697 --> 00:15:27,731
DRAKE SENT US
PERSONALLY, YOU'RE SAFE.

236
00:15:27,732 --> 00:15:29,166
NOW TELL ME WHERE
THOSE LIZARDS ARE.

237
00:15:29,167 --> 00:15:30,534
- I DON'T KNOW.

238
00:15:30,535 --> 00:15:31,602
I'VE BEEN HIDING IN THE
BRUSH FOR THE LAST SIX HOURS.

239
00:15:31,603 --> 00:15:32,903
I'VE NEVER BEEN SO
SCARED IN MY LIFE.

240
00:15:32,904 --> 00:15:33,904
- ANY SURVIVORS?

241
00:15:33,905 --> 00:15:34,805
- I DON'T THINK SO.

242
00:15:34,806 --> 00:15:37,274
I-I'M JUST GLAD I MADE IT.

243
00:15:37,275 --> 00:15:39,009
- YOU DIDN'T.

244
00:15:39,009 --> 00:15:40,343
- WAIT-WAIT-WAIT.

245
00:15:43,347 --> 00:15:46,048
- ALL RIGHT, DRAKE SAID THE
FACILITY WAS THREE CLICKS

246
00:15:46,049 --> 00:15:47,517
IN FROM THE BEACH.

247
00:15:47,518 --> 00:15:49,852
MONROE, MARZDEN,
YOU ALL GO THAT WAY.

248
00:15:49,853 --> 00:15:52,255
LEARNER, PATTERSON, YOU ALL
CUT AROUND THE OTHER SIDE.

249
00:15:52,256 --> 00:15:53,689
WIDGE, YOU'RE WITH ME.

250
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:56,092
REMEMBER WE
HAVE OUR ORDERS.

251
00:15:56,093 --> 00:15:58,328
NO WITNESSES.

252
00:16:17,748 --> 00:16:18,948
- FRANK, DID YOU HEAR THAT?

253
00:16:18,949 --> 00:16:19,849
- QUIET.

254
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:21,351
- SOUNDS LIKE ONE
OF OUR REPTILES.

255
00:16:21,352 --> 00:16:22,485
BE READY TO ROCK AND ROLL.

256
00:16:22,486 --> 00:16:23,886
- ROGER THAT.

257
00:16:28,892 --> 00:16:29,992
- MAN, I DON'T KNOW IF I
COULD STOMACH SHOOTING

258
00:16:29,993 --> 00:16:31,427
CIVILIANS LIKE THAT.

259
00:16:31,428 --> 00:16:32,462
- DON'T THINK OF
IT AS CIVILIANS.

260
00:16:32,463 --> 00:16:34,430
THINK OF IT AS DOLLAR SIGNS.

261
00:16:34,431 --> 00:16:37,066
MONEY ALWAYS
EASES THE CONSCIENCE.

262
00:16:38,702 --> 00:16:40,770
- YOU REALLY BELIEVE
WE'RE HUNTING GIANT LIZARDS?

263
00:16:40,771 --> 00:16:42,572
- GUESS WE'LL FIND OUT.

264
00:16:42,572 --> 00:16:43,438
[growling]

265
00:16:43,439 --> 00:16:45,440
- WHAT WAS THAT?

266
00:16:46,709 --> 00:16:47,942
- OH.

267
00:16:49,745 --> 00:16:51,246
- AH!

268
00:16:52,415 --> 00:16:54,216
- PATTERSON,
LEARNER, WHAT'S GOING ON?

269
00:16:54,217 --> 00:16:56,251
PATTERSON, COME IN.

270
00:16:56,252 --> 00:16:57,686
MARZDEN, YOU NEAR THEM?

271
00:16:57,687 --> 00:16:58,253
- NEGATIVE.

272
00:16:58,254 --> 00:16:59,521
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

273
00:16:59,522 --> 00:17:00,922
- GET BACK TO THE RENDEZVOUS
POINT ON THE DOUBLE.

274
00:17:00,923 --> 00:17:03,659
- WE'RE HALF WAY THERE.

275
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:05,327
- MOVE OUT.

276
00:17:08,198 --> 00:17:10,199
- MOVE, MOVE, MOVE.

277
00:17:39,429 --> 00:17:40,161
- DID YOU HEAR THAT?

278
00:17:40,162 --> 00:17:41,029
- YEAH.

279
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:42,864
- THIS WAY.

280
00:17:50,639 --> 00:17:52,673
STOP PLAYING AND
START SHOOTING.

281
00:18:00,749 --> 00:18:01,716
THIS AIN'T DOING NOTHING.

282
00:18:01,717 --> 00:18:03,451
GIVE HIM THE C-4.

283
00:18:12,461 --> 00:18:13,494
GET DOWN.

284
00:18:17,999 --> 00:18:19,267
IT DIDN'T WORK.

285
00:18:19,268 --> 00:18:20,735
MOVE OUT.

286
00:18:28,943 --> 00:18:30,010
- DO YOU THINK WE LOST HIM?

287
00:18:30,011 --> 00:18:32,313
- I DON'T KNOW.

288
00:18:32,314 --> 00:18:34,081
BUT WE GETTING
OUTTA HERE RIGHT NOW.

289
00:18:34,082 --> 00:18:36,550
RADIO THE CHOPPER AND
TELL 'EM WE NEED EXTRACTION.

290
00:18:36,551 --> 00:18:38,185
- DRAKE TEAM XV1, COME IN.

291
00:18:38,186 --> 00:18:40,388
I SAID DRAKE
TEAM XV1, COME IN.

292
00:18:56,136 --> 00:18:58,371
- GENTLEMEN, IN TERMS OF
INVESTMENT, I ASSURE YOU

293
00:18:58,372 --> 00:19:03,443
YOUR MONEY IS SAFER WITH ME
THAN IT WOULD BE IN A BANK.

294
00:19:03,444 --> 00:19:04,977
- SORRY, MA'AM, THIS
IS A PRIVATE PARTY.

295
00:19:04,978 --> 00:19:05,912
- I HAVE AN INVITATION.

296
00:19:05,913 --> 00:19:07,113
- I HAVE TO SEE
WHAT INVITATION.

297
00:19:07,114 --> 00:19:07,980
- YOU HAVE THREE SECONDS

298
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:09,148
TO GET YOUR HAND
OFF MY SHOULDER.

299
00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:10,116
- JUST SHOW ME
THE INVITATION.

300
00:19:10,117 --> 00:19:11,384
- ONE, TWO.

301
00:19:11,385 --> 00:19:12,519
- LOOK, LADY, JUST
SHOW ME THE INVITATION.

302
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,687
- THREE.

303
00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:21,093
- EXCUSE ME.

304
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,368
VERY SUBTLE.

305
00:19:28,369 --> 00:19:31,270
- YOU DON'T PAY
ME FOR SUBTLETY.

306
00:19:31,271 --> 00:19:33,039
- WHAT THE HELL DO
YOU WANT, VICTORIA?

307
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,541
- WE HAVE A PROBLEM.

308
00:19:34,542 --> 00:19:36,443
FRANK AND HIS MEN NEVER MADE IT
BACK TO THE EXTRACTION POINT.

309
00:19:36,444 --> 00:19:37,410
- OH.

310
00:19:37,411 --> 00:19:38,511
- AND THERE'S BEEN
NO RADIO CONTACT

311
00:19:38,512 --> 00:19:39,879
SINCE THEY TOUCHED
DOWN ON THE ISLAND.

312
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,013
- DAMN.

313
00:19:41,014 --> 00:19:43,550
- SO, WE CALL IN MORE MARKS?

314
00:19:43,551 --> 00:19:47,487
- TELL YOU WHAT, VICTORIA,
WHEN I WAS A KID GROWING UP

315
00:19:47,488 --> 00:19:50,156
ON THE LOWER WEST SIDE
OF MANHATTAN THERE WAS

316
00:19:50,157 --> 00:19:54,227
THIS PIZZA JOINT ON THE CORNER
OF NINTH AVENUE AN 22nd STREET.

317
00:19:54,228 --> 00:19:56,763
A LITTLE MOM
AND POP PLACE.

318
00:19:56,763 --> 00:20:00,165
EVERY BOX THEY SENT OUT
HAD WRITTEN ON IT,

319
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:04,903
"YOU'VE TRIED THE REST,
NOW TRY THE BEST."

320
00:20:04,904 --> 00:20:06,338
CALL THE CAJUN.

321
00:20:06,339 --> 00:20:07,840
- THE CAJUN?

322
00:20:07,841 --> 00:20:11,042
- THE CAJUN, IN MY ROLODEX.

323
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,914
- LOGAN.

324
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:50,416
- I'M LOOKING FOR A
MAN CALLED THE CAJUN.

325
00:20:50,417 --> 00:20:51,483
- YEAH, WELL, YOU GOT HIM.

326
00:20:51,484 --> 00:20:52,584
WHO'S THIS?

327
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:54,286
- I'M CALLING IN
BEHALF OF MR. JASON DRAKE.

328
00:20:54,287 --> 00:20:55,821
I BELIEVE YOU
ALREADY KNOW HIM.

329
00:20:55,822 --> 00:20:58,490
- YEAH, I KNOW HIM.

330
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:08,299
WHAT DOES HE WANT ME
TO KILL THIS TIME?

331
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:20,177
- IF YOU'RE CALLING TO
TELL ME TO PACK MY BAGS

332
00:21:20,178 --> 00:21:21,913
I HAVEN'T CAUGHT
MY QUOTA YET.

333
00:21:21,914 --> 00:21:23,514
- OH, YEAH, AND WHAT'S
YOUR QUOTA FOR TODAY?

334
00:21:23,515 --> 00:21:25,716
- I'D SETTLE
FOR AT LEAST ONE.

335
00:21:25,717 --> 00:21:27,117
BUT WE BOTH KNOW THAT'S
NOT WHY YOU'RE CALLING,

336
00:21:27,118 --> 00:21:28,118
NOW IS IT?

337
00:21:28,119 --> 00:21:29,587
- IT'S NOT.

338
00:21:29,588 --> 00:21:31,489
LOOK, AFTER OUR CONVERSATION
THIS MORNING I'M THINKING AGAIN

339
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:33,057
ABOUT WHAT I SAW
IN THOSE FIELDS.

340
00:21:33,058 --> 00:21:34,224
YEAH.

341
00:21:34,225 --> 00:21:35,760
I THINK DRAKE MIGHT
BE UP TO SOMETHING.

342
00:21:35,761 --> 00:21:37,061
- NO QUESTION.

343
00:21:37,062 --> 00:21:39,396
BUT, WHAT DID
YOU GO AND DO?

344
00:21:39,397 --> 00:21:40,998
SOMETHING...

345
00:21:40,999 --> 00:21:42,733
ILLEGAL, I ASSUME?

346
00:21:42,734 --> 00:21:43,768
- NOT REALLY.

347
00:21:43,769 --> 00:21:45,135
I DID GO OVER THE
COMMITTEES HEAD, THOUGH.

348
00:21:45,136 --> 00:21:46,437
I CALLED IN A FAVOR
FROM A BUDDY OF MINE

349
00:21:46,438 --> 00:21:47,538
OVER AT LANGLEY.

350
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:48,473
- CIA?

351
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:51,509
- TECHNICALLY NO,
BUT, YEAH, KINDA.

352
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:52,409
HE HOOKED US UP.

353
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:53,878
- HOW?

354
00:21:53,879 --> 00:21:55,746
- LET'S JUST SAY I HAD A DIRECT
FEED WHEN THE EYE IN THE SKY

355
00:21:55,747 --> 00:21:58,315
TOOK AN UNSCHEDULED
FLIGHT OVER THE ISLAND.

356
00:21:58,316 --> 00:21:59,249
- MARK, I LOVE YOU.

357
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:00,351
WHAT DID YOU FIND?

358
00:22:00,352 --> 00:22:01,652
- WELL, YOU KNOW THOSE
CAGE ENCLOSURES

359
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:02,720
YOU'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT?

360
00:22:02,721 --> 00:22:04,054
- YEAH.

361
00:22:04,055 --> 00:22:05,155
- WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE
BROUGHT A DEMOLITION TEAM

362
00:22:05,156 --> 00:22:05,957
IN THERE.

363
00:22:05,957 --> 00:22:07,423
TOOK THE PLACE APART.

364
00:22:07,424 --> 00:22:09,626
THE, UH, EXTERIOR WALLS
HAVE GAPING HOLES IN 'EM.

365
00:22:09,627 --> 00:22:11,595
THERE'S RUBBLE ALL
OVER THE COURTYARD.

366
00:22:11,596 --> 00:22:13,597
THE PLACE IS A MESS.

367
00:22:13,598 --> 00:22:14,764
- DID YOU ALERT
THE COMMITTEE?

368
00:22:14,765 --> 00:22:15,699
- YEAH, I SHOWED
THEM THE PICTURES

369
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:17,166
AS SOON AS
I GOT BACK.

370
00:22:17,167 --> 00:22:18,602
AND HERE'S THE THING-FIRST
THING THEY DID

371
00:22:18,603 --> 00:22:20,370
WAS CALL DRAKE.

372
00:22:20,371 --> 00:22:21,471
THE GUY HASN'T
CALLED HIM BACK

373
00:22:21,472 --> 00:22:22,639
AND HE'S BEING PRETTY
CAGEY ABOUT IT.

374
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,074
BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT
ROBERTSON WANTS YOU

375
00:22:25,075 --> 00:22:26,943
TO STAY PUT.

376
00:22:26,944 --> 00:22:29,145
HE WANTS YOU TO
KEEP DIGGING.

377
00:22:29,146 --> 00:22:30,847
GO BUILD A CASE.

378
00:22:30,848 --> 00:22:31,982
- THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I WANTED TO HEAR.

379
00:22:31,983 --> 00:22:33,683
GREAT, UM...

380
00:22:33,684 --> 00:22:35,018
I'LL CALL YOU
TOMORROW, ALL RIGHT?

381
00:22:35,019 --> 00:22:36,252
- GOOD.

382
00:22:36,253 --> 00:22:37,921
GO CATCH SOMETHING BIG.

383
00:22:37,922 --> 00:22:40,100
- YEAH, SOMETHING
TELLS ME, I THINK I MIGHT.

384
00:22:42,101 --> 00:22:43,890
¶
[ Motor Sound Behind ]

385
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:16,475
[ Motor Dying ]

386
00:23:23,383 --> 00:23:25,118
- COME ON.

387
00:24:07,815 --> 00:24:09,348
- AHOY.

388
00:24:09,351 --> 00:24:11,652
- HI.

389
00:24:11,656 --> 00:24:13,657
- HAVING SOME
ENGINE TROUBLE?

390
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:16,696
- I DON'T KNOW.

391
00:24:16,701 --> 00:24:18,836
EVERYTHING WAS FINE AND
THEN THE BOAT ROCKED

392
00:24:18,839 --> 00:24:22,674
LIKE IN A STORM AND THE
MOTOR JUST KILLED.

393
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,949
- LET'S GET YOU UP HERE
AND WE'LL TAKE A LOOK.

394
00:24:24,952 --> 00:24:26,018
- DON'T GO TO ANY TROUBLE.

395
00:24:26,021 --> 00:24:27,155
I ALWAYS CALL FOR A TOW.

396
00:24:27,157 --> 00:24:29,591
- IT'S NO TROUBLE.

397
00:24:29,595 --> 00:24:32,164
I DON'T MIND
GETTING MY HANDS DIRTY.

398
00:24:32,168 --> 00:24:33,635
I'M PAUL, BY THE WAY.

399
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:36,606
- SWANSON, CASSIDY SWANSON.

400
00:24:40,186 --> 00:24:42,020
ARE YOU HERE ON VACATION?

401
00:24:42,023 --> 00:24:44,191
- MORE LIKE A SABBATICAL.

402
00:24:44,194 --> 00:24:45,594
MY BOSS HAS BEEN
WAITING A YEAR FOR ME

403
00:24:45,597 --> 00:24:47,131
TO COMPLETE SOME
IMPORTANT THEOREMS

404
00:24:47,134 --> 00:24:48,534
AND I GUESS HE
FIGURED THE BEST WAY

405
00:24:48,537 --> 00:24:50,972
TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN WAS TO
IMPRISON ME HERE IN PARADISE.

406
00:24:50,975 --> 00:24:52,810
- THEOREMS, YOU'RE
A SCIENTIST, HUH?

407
00:24:52,814 --> 00:24:55,481
- UH, AN ENGINEER, OF SORTS.

408
00:24:55,485 --> 00:24:57,520
- OF SORTS.

409
00:24:57,523 --> 00:24:59,590
SOUNDS VERY
MYSTERIOUS, PAUL.

410
00:25:02,869 --> 00:25:04,703
- I THINK I FOUND
YOUR PROBLEM.

411
00:25:04,706 --> 00:25:06,006
- WHAT?

412
00:25:06,008 --> 00:25:07,375
- OH, IT'S YOUR PROP.

413
00:25:07,378 --> 00:25:08,946
THE BLADES ARE BENT
STRAIGHT BACK TO THE HAUL.

414
00:25:08,949 --> 00:25:09,949
YOU HIT A ROCK
OR SOMETHING?

415
00:25:09,951 --> 00:25:11,451
- NOT IN THE
MIDDLE OF THE RIVER.

416
00:25:11,454 --> 00:25:13,655
- WELL, YOU'RE NOT GETTING BACK
TO THE DOCKS IN THIS THING.

417
00:25:13,659 --> 00:25:15,260
I'VE GOT A JEEP.

418
00:25:15,262 --> 00:25:16,762
BE GLAD TO GIVE
YOU A LIFT.

419
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:18,666
- ALL RIGHT, THANKS.

420
00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:20,804
- I'M PARKED JUST
UP THE TRAIL HERE.

421
00:25:28,893 --> 00:25:31,261
SO WHAT'S IT
LIKE BEING A COP?

422
00:25:31,265 --> 00:25:32,765
- MY DAD'S A COP.

423
00:25:32,767 --> 00:25:35,668
I'M A CONSERVATION OFFICER WITH
THE FISH AND GAME DEPARTMENT.

424
00:25:35,673 --> 00:25:37,674
- SOUNDS GLAMOROUS.

425
00:25:37,677 --> 00:25:39,478
SO, WHAT, UH, DROVE A
PRETTY GIRL LIKE YOU

426
00:25:39,481 --> 00:25:40,882
INTO THAT LINE OF WORK?

427
00:25:40,885 --> 00:25:42,786
- SIMPLE, I LOVE ANIMALS.

428
00:25:42,789 --> 00:25:45,291
I HATE SEEING THEM
HURT OR EXPLOITED.

429
00:25:45,295 --> 00:25:48,096
SO WHEN I HAD THE CHANCE I
APPLIED AND GOT THE JOB.

430
00:25:48,101 --> 00:25:50,569
- MUST HAVE MADE
YOUR DAD HAPPY.

431
00:25:50,573 --> 00:25:53,375
- YOU'VE OBVIOUSLY
NEVER MET MY FATHER.

432
00:25:53,379 --> 00:25:55,647
- A CONSERVATION
OFFICER, HUH?

433
00:25:55,651 --> 00:25:58,386
SO IF I, UH, EVER HUNT DOWN
ONE OF THESE WILD BOAR

434
00:25:58,390 --> 00:25:59,958
I SEE RUNNING AROUND?

435
00:25:59,961 --> 00:26:02,862
- I'D THROW YOU UP AGAINST
THE HOOD AND HANDCUFF YOU.

436
00:26:02,866 --> 00:26:05,634
- REALLY, IS THAT A
PROMISE OR A THREAT?

437
00:26:07,844 --> 00:26:10,212
- WATCH OUT!

438
00:26:11,085 --> 00:26:11,985
- YOU ALL RIGHT?

439
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:14,088
- YEAH, I'M FINE.

440
00:26:17,366 --> 00:26:18,699
- I CAME DOWN THIS
ROAD TWO DAYS AGO.

441
00:26:18,701 --> 00:26:20,235
THIS MUST HAVE
JUST HAPPENED.

442
00:26:20,238 --> 00:26:21,238
- COULDN'T HAVE
BEEN A MUDSLIDE,

443
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,707
HASN'T BEEN ENOUGH
RAIN FOR THAT.

444
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:24,277
- HOW'D ALL THESE
ROCKS GET HERE THEN?

445
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:27,383
[distant rumbling]

446
00:26:27,388 --> 00:26:29,022
WHAT WAS THAT, THUNDER?

447
00:26:29,024 --> 00:26:31,758
- NOT LIKE I'VE EVER HEARD.

448
00:26:31,763 --> 00:26:35,333
- I SUDDENLY FEEL THE NEED
TO BE AROUND A LOT OF PEOPLE.

449
00:26:36,741 --> 00:26:37,674
- THERE'S ANOTHER WAY BACK

450
00:26:37,676 --> 00:26:38,809
THROUGH THE DRAKE
GAME PRESERVE.

451
00:26:38,811 --> 00:26:39,711
WE PASSED THE GATE
ABOUT TWO MILES BACK.

452
00:26:39,713 --> 00:26:40,980
BUT I THINK IT
WAS LOCKED.

453
00:26:40,983 --> 00:26:43,018
- WELL, WE'LL TRYING
UNLOCKING IT THEN.

454
00:26:43,021 --> 00:26:44,888
- THAT'S COMMONLY
CALLED TRESPASSING.

455
00:26:44,891 --> 00:26:46,325
- HEY, DESPERATE TIMES
CALL FOR DESPERATE MEASURES.

456
00:26:46,328 --> 00:26:48,029
COME ON, GET IN.

457
00:27:04,368 --> 00:27:05,802
- WHERE ARE THE GUYS?

458
00:27:05,804 --> 00:27:06,937
- I TRIED TO WAKE UP
KYLE, BUT HE WAS OUT.

459
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:08,808
TOTALLY OUT.

460
00:27:08,811 --> 00:27:10,479
JOHNNY OPENED HIS EYES
LONG ENOUGH TO MUMBLE,

461
00:27:10,482 --> 00:27:12,116
"GO WITHOUT US."

462
00:27:12,119 --> 00:27:15,154
- DORKS, I KNEW WHEN THEY
STARTED DRINKING LAST NIGHT

463
00:27:15,158 --> 00:27:16,391
THAT THIS WOULD HAPPEN.

464
00:27:16,394 --> 00:27:18,895
- I KNOW, SO DO
YOU WANNA CANCEL?

465
00:27:18,899 --> 00:27:21,135
- CANCEL A HELICOPTER
RIDE TO A LOST WATERFALL?

466
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:22,405
NO, WAY.

467
00:27:22,407 --> 00:27:23,574
I'M GOING.

468
00:27:23,577 --> 00:27:26,246
- OKAY, I'LL GO CHECK
WITH THE FRONT DESK.

469
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:28,551
HEY, MAYBE WE CAN GET A
REFUND ON THE GUYS FARE

470
00:27:28,554 --> 00:27:30,221
AND USE IT FOR
SHOPPING LATER.

471
00:27:30,224 --> 00:27:33,593
- SOUNDS GOOD TO ME.
- OKAY.

472
00:27:42,185 --> 00:27:44,786
- TAKE A PICTURE
IT'LL LAST LONGER.

473
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:46,224
- AM I BOTHERING YOU?

474
00:27:46,227 --> 00:27:49,663
- YES, YOU ARE.

475
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:53,704
- IT'S JUST I THOUGHT
I RECOGNIZED YOU.

476
00:27:53,709 --> 00:27:57,011
- MY EYES ARE UP HERE, HONEY.

477
00:27:57,016 --> 00:27:59,851
- IT'S NOT THE
PART I RECOGNIZED.

478
00:27:59,856 --> 00:28:01,557
- WHY DON'T YOU TAKE A HIKE
BEFORE I CALL SECURITY

479
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,361
AND HAVE YOU THROWN OUT.

480
00:28:03,364 --> 00:28:04,364
- HEY, THAT'S
NOT VERY FRIENDLY.

481
00:28:04,366 --> 00:28:06,767
- DON'T TOUCH ME.

482
00:28:07,673 --> 00:28:08,906
- CHICA, YOU'RE IN PARADISE.

483
00:28:08,909 --> 00:28:10,977
YOU GOTTA
LEARN TO CHILL.

484
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:13,582
- HEY, PAL, YOU
NEED TO COOL OFF.

485
00:28:13,586 --> 00:28:16,221
- AH!

486
00:28:18,797 --> 00:28:22,066
- LADY SAID SHE
WASN'T INTERESTED.

487
00:28:26,915 --> 00:28:30,551
YOU HAVE A NICE DAY, MA'AM.

488
00:28:36,035 --> 00:28:38,604
- MR. LOGAN, SOMEONE FROM
MR. DRAKE'S OFFICE CALLED.

489
00:28:38,608 --> 00:28:42,477
THEY WANT YOU TO
MEET AT THIS LOCATION.

490
00:28:42,483 --> 00:28:44,050
- ANYTHING ELSE?

491
00:28:44,053 --> 00:28:45,887
- YES, THEY WANTED ME TO INFORM
THAT EVERYTHING'S READY

492
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:47,792
FOR YOUR HUNTING EXPEDITION.

493
00:28:47,795 --> 00:28:50,630
- DO ME A FAVOR,
CALL 'EM BACK,

494
00:28:50,634 --> 00:28:52,768
TELL 'EM I'LL BE THERE
WITHIN AN HOUR.

495
00:28:52,772 --> 00:28:54,540
- WILL DO.

496
00:28:58,452 --> 00:28:59,485
POOL DESK.

497
00:28:59,487 --> 00:29:00,687
- JERRY.

498
00:29:00,689 --> 00:29:01,656
- THAT'S ME.

499
00:29:01,659 --> 00:29:03,860
- JERRY, IT'S ME,
CHAZ KINGSLEY.

500
00:29:03,863 --> 00:29:05,764
- IT'S GOOD TO HEAR YOUR
VOICE AGAIN, MR. KINGSLEY.

501
00:29:05,767 --> 00:29:06,834
- GREAT TO HEAR
YOUR VOICE, TOO.

502
00:29:06,837 --> 00:29:08,036
BUT YOU'RE NOT ONLY
GONNA HEAR ME,

503
00:29:08,038 --> 00:29:09,439
YOU'RE GONNA SEE ME IN
LESS THAN FOUR HOURS.

504
00:29:09,442 --> 00:29:11,777
I'M CATCHING A STUDIO
JET TO THE ISLAND

505
00:29:11,781 --> 00:29:13,382
IN LESS THAN TEN MINUTES.

506
00:29:13,385 --> 00:29:14,485
- THAT'S WONDERFUL.

507
00:29:14,487 --> 00:29:15,487
- IT IS WONDERFUL.

508
00:29:15,489 --> 00:29:17,089
I'M ALMOST AT THE
AIRPORT RIGHT NOW.

509
00:29:17,092 --> 00:29:19,727
JUST WRAPPED ANOTHER
SEQUEL TO "MANIAC MAN"

510
00:29:19,731 --> 00:29:23,267
AND DECIDED IT'S TIME FOR
A LITTLE RATED R AND R.

511
00:29:23,272 --> 00:29:24,806
- WELL, THE WEATHER'S
BEEN GREAT

512
00:29:24,809 --> 00:29:26,476
AND THE FISHING'S
TO DIE FOR.

513
00:29:26,479 --> 00:29:28,680
- YOU KNOW HOW I
LOVE MY TILAPIA.

514
00:29:28,684 --> 00:29:29,618
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

515
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:31,921
I NEED TO ASK YOU
A VERY BIG FAVOR.

516
00:29:31,925 --> 00:29:33,025
- ANYTHING.

517
00:29:33,027 --> 00:29:34,961
- ANYTHING IS MY
FAVORITE WORD.

518
00:29:34,964 --> 00:29:37,265
NOW, I HAVE THE
PRIVATE VILLA, AS USUAL.

519
00:29:37,269 --> 00:29:39,337
BUT I NEED IT STOCKED
WITH EVERYTHING--

520
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:43,043
FOOD, LIQUOR, CHEESES,
ALL BEFORE I GET THERE.

521
00:29:43,049 --> 00:29:44,516
- I'LL MAKE SURE
THAT HAPPENS, SIR.

522
00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:46,687
- GREAT, AND I'LL MAKE SURE
THAT YOU'RE WELL COMPENSATED

523
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:48,357
FOR WHEN I SEE YOU.

524
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,393
- NO PROBLEM, MR. KINGSLEY.

525
00:29:49,395 --> 00:29:50,162
- GREAT.

526
00:29:50,164 --> 00:29:50,964
OH, AND JER'.

527
00:29:50,966 --> 00:29:52,366
- YES?

528
00:29:52,369 --> 00:29:54,337
- MAKE SURE YOU BRING ENOUGH
FOR THREE IF YOU, UH,

529
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:55,406
CATCH MY DRIFT.

530
00:29:55,409 --> 00:29:57,878
- THAT, I DO, SIR.

531
00:29:57,882 --> 00:30:00,183
HAVE A GREAT FLIGHT.

532
00:30:08,137 --> 00:30:15,176
- YOU KNOW IT'S MY SWORN
DUTY TO ARREST PEOPLE

533
00:30:15,185 --> 00:30:17,020
AND CRAZY AND YOU CAN SAY
APED MENTAL PATIENT.

534
00:30:17,023 --> 00:30:19,157
- THAT WOULD
EXPLAIN THE SHIRT.

535
00:30:19,161 --> 00:30:21,563
- I LIKE THIS SHIRT.

536
00:30:21,567 --> 00:30:24,368
ALL RIGHT, WE'RE IN.

537
00:30:24,372 --> 00:30:25,439
- WHERE'D YOU LEARN THAT?

538
00:30:25,441 --> 00:30:27,242
- OH, MY MISSPENT YOUTH.

539
00:30:27,246 --> 00:30:29,781
- FIGURES, I'M OUT
WITH A CONVICTED FELON.

540
00:30:29,785 --> 00:30:33,621
- HEY, I WAS
NEVER CONVICTED.

541
00:30:35,263 --> 00:30:37,297
WHAT?

542
00:30:37,301 --> 00:30:38,501
- NOTHING.

543
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:40,471
I WAS JUST TRYING TO
FIGURE YOU OUT, IS ALL.

544
00:30:40,474 --> 00:30:41,407
- WHERE'S THERE
TO FIGURE OUT?

545
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:42,978
I TOLD YOU, I'M
AN ENGINEER.

546
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:45,414
COME ON.

547
00:31:16,419 --> 00:31:19,689
- OH, MY IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

548
00:31:31,586 --> 00:31:32,352
- OH!

549
00:31:32,354 --> 00:31:34,289
- JEEZ, YOU SCARED ME.

550
00:31:34,293 --> 00:31:37,162
- SORRY ABOUT THAT.

551
00:31:37,166 --> 00:31:39,567
SAW THE HELICOPTER THOUGHT
IT MIGHT BE THE SHERIFF.

552
00:31:39,571 --> 00:31:41,872
- SHERIFF, WHY WOULD YOU
NEED A SHERIFF UP HERE?

553
00:31:41,876 --> 00:31:43,310
- IS SOMETHING WRONG?

554
00:31:43,312 --> 00:31:46,014
- NOTHING YOU GUYS NEED TO
WORRY YOUR LITTLE HEADS ABOUT.

555
00:31:48,591 --> 00:31:49,891
- WHAT'S THAT?

556
00:31:49,893 --> 00:31:51,293
- CAMERA.

557
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:53,932
TRY TO KEEP IT
HIDDEN FROM THE WILDLIFE.

558
00:31:53,936 --> 00:31:57,371
A PHOTOGRAPHER FOR, UH,
"MOTHER NATURE MAGAZINE".

559
00:31:57,376 --> 00:31:59,745
YOU MIGHT HAVE HEARD
OF ME, REESE HAMMOND.

560
00:31:59,749 --> 00:32:02,083
- OH, HAVE YOU DONE
THOSE ANIMAL SHOWS ON CABLE?

561
00:32:02,087 --> 00:32:03,320
- I LOVE THOSE.

562
00:32:03,322 --> 00:32:05,190
- DID A FEW.

563
00:32:05,193 --> 00:32:06,627
- MUST BE FUN GOING
ALL OVER THE WORLD

564
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:08,364
IN EXOTIC LOCATIONS.

565
00:32:08,367 --> 00:32:10,568
- IT HAS ITS MOMENTS.

566
00:32:12,911 --> 00:32:18,615
- SO, MAYBE YOU SHOULD SHOOT
US IN FRONT OF THE WATERFALL.

567
00:32:18,623 --> 00:32:20,858
- YEAH, I'M SURE, UH, IT'S
GONNA BE GREAT FOR MY EDITOR.

568
00:32:20,861 --> 00:32:22,962
NOT SO MUCH FOR THE
PRODUCERS, THOUGH.

569
00:32:22,966 --> 00:32:25,668
- AH, COME ON.

570
00:32:31,285 --> 00:32:34,086
- YOU CAN ALWAYS
CUT IT OUT LATER.

571
00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:35,691
- ONE ROLL.

572
00:32:46,083 --> 00:32:48,551
OKAY, YOU GUYS ARE
GONNA LOVE THIS PICTURE.

573
00:33:01,717 --> 00:33:03,785
- AH!

574
00:33:32,518 --> 00:33:33,885
- DO YOU THINK IT'S GONE?

575
00:33:33,887 --> 00:33:35,755
- I THINK SO.

576
00:33:38,798 --> 00:33:40,366
- I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

577
00:33:40,369 --> 00:33:41,702
THAT POOR GUY.

578
00:33:41,705 --> 00:33:44,841
HE WAS SO CUTE.

579
00:33:44,845 --> 00:33:47,046
- IT'S GONNA BE, "POOR US"
IF WE DON'T GET OUTTA HERE.

580
00:33:47,050 --> 00:33:48,985
- COME ON.

581
00:33:53,167 --> 00:33:54,334
- WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

582
00:33:54,336 --> 00:33:56,638
THE CHOPPER DOESN'T
GET BACK UNTIL FOUR.

583
00:33:56,641 --> 00:33:58,108
- I DON'T KNOW.

584
00:33:58,111 --> 00:33:59,778
WHICH WAY TO THE HOTEL?

585
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:00,680
[growling]

586
00:34:00,682 --> 00:34:02,483
- WHAT'S THAT SOUND?

587
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:06,658
- AH!

588
00:34:41,394 --> 00:34:42,661
- HOWDY, SHERI.

589
00:34:42,663 --> 00:34:44,864
- THANKS FOR COMING
SO QUICK, CHARLIE.

590
00:34:44,867 --> 00:34:47,268
- THAT'S YOUR TAX
DOLLARS AT WORK.

591
00:34:47,271 --> 00:34:48,973
SO WHAT SEEMS TO BE
THE PROBLEM HERE?

592
00:34:48,976 --> 00:34:50,576
YOU WERE PRETTY
VAGUE ON THE PHONE.

593
00:34:50,578 --> 00:34:52,178
- BACK HERE, CHECK IT OUT.

594
00:35:04,805 --> 00:35:06,940
- OH, MY WORD.

595
00:35:06,943 --> 00:35:08,677
- FOUND HER LAYING LIKE THIS,
THIS MORNING WHEN I GOT BACK

596
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:10,881
FROM FEEDING THE GRAIN.

597
00:35:10,884 --> 00:35:14,186
- ANY OF YOU SEE
ANYTHING, HEAR ANYTHING?

598
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:17,292
- NOTHING OUT OF THE
ORDINARY, EXCEPT...

599
00:35:17,296 --> 00:35:19,931
- WELL, WHAT,
ROY, SPIT IT OUT.

600
00:35:19,935 --> 00:35:22,236
- WELL I WAS MENDING THE
FENCES ON THE BACK FORTY

601
00:35:22,239 --> 00:35:25,241
THIS MORNING AND SUDDENLY
THE WHOLE HEARD JUST GOT UP

602
00:35:25,244 --> 00:35:26,945
AND STAMPEDED
UP THE HILL.

603
00:35:26,948 --> 00:35:27,882
IF I HADN'T GOTTEN
OUT OF THE WAY

604
00:35:27,884 --> 00:35:29,584
THEY WOULD HAVE
RUN ME OVER.

605
00:35:29,587 --> 00:35:31,321
- WHO COULD HAVE
DONE THIS, SHERI?

606
00:35:31,323 --> 00:35:32,490
- I'LL TELL YOU WHAT
COULD HAVE DONE THIS,

607
00:35:32,492 --> 00:35:34,026
THIS IS A CATTLE MUTILATION
JUST LIKE YOU SEE

608
00:35:34,029 --> 00:35:35,730
ON THE U.F.O. SHOWS.

609
00:35:35,732 --> 00:35:37,599
- OH, CRAP, NOT THIS AGAIN.

610
00:35:37,602 --> 00:35:40,204
- I'M TELLING
YA, IT'S ALIENS.

611
00:35:40,207 --> 00:35:41,708
FIRST THEY GO
FOR OUR ANIMALS.

612
00:35:41,711 --> 00:35:44,245
THEN THEY GO
FOR OUR WOMEN.

613
00:35:44,248 --> 00:35:45,849
- I'VE SEEN YOUR WIFE.

614
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:47,686
TRUST ME, ROY, SHE'S SAFE.

615
00:35:47,688 --> 00:35:52,458
LOOK HERE.

616
00:35:53,867 --> 00:35:56,102
THAT FLESH WAS TORN APART BY
WHAT LOOKS LIKE HUGE TEETH.

617
00:35:56,105 --> 00:35:57,404
IF E.T. DID IT,

618
00:35:57,406 --> 00:35:59,407
HE'S GOT ONE HELL
OF AN OVERBITE.

619
00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:01,045
- YEAH, BUT THAT DOESN'T
TELL US WHAT KIND OF ANIMAL

620
00:36:01,048 --> 00:36:02,749
DID THIS TO HIM.

621
00:36:02,751 --> 00:36:05,685
- NO, IT DOESN'T.

622
00:36:07,226 --> 00:36:09,193
IT'S WHY I'M CALLING
CASSIDY RIGHT AWAY.

623
00:36:09,196 --> 00:36:12,132
IN THE MEANTIME, MAKE SURE
TO CALL THE OTHER RANCHERS,

624
00:36:12,136 --> 00:36:13,535
TELL THEM EXACTLY
WHAT HAPPENED.

625
00:36:13,537 --> 00:36:14,704
- WILL DO.

626
00:36:14,706 --> 00:36:17,942
- EXACTLY WHAT DID
HAPPEN HERE, SHERI?

627
00:36:19,416 --> 00:36:21,617
- WISH I KNEW.

628
00:36:32,741 --> 00:36:35,743
SWANSON TO LAUNCH,
SWANSON TO LAUNCH, COME IN.

629
00:36:37,350 --> 00:36:39,551
SWANSON TO LAUNCH,
CASSIDY, COME IN.

630
00:36:39,554 --> 00:36:41,422
SWANSON TO LAUNCH, COME IN.

631
00:36:42,995 --> 00:36:46,364
DAMN IT, DAUGHTER, WHERE THE
HELL ARE YOU WHEN I NEED YOU?

632
00:37:08,143 --> 00:37:09,543
SWANSON TO LAUNCH.

633
00:37:09,545 --> 00:37:13,983
SWANSON TO LAUNCH, FOR THE
TENTH TIME, CASSIDY, COME IN.

634
00:37:26,578 --> 00:37:31,283
- SO, PAUL THE ENGINEER, TELL
ME SOMETHING ABOUT YOURSELF.

635
00:37:31,288 --> 00:37:32,354
- NOT MUCH TO TELL, REALLY.

636
00:37:32,356 --> 00:37:35,591
I'M SORT OF BORING.

637
00:37:35,595 --> 00:37:38,197
- COME ON, OUT WITH IT.

638
00:37:38,201 --> 00:37:40,502
- JEEZ, IS THIS
AN INTERROGATION?

639
00:37:40,505 --> 00:37:43,741
SHOULDN'T YOU, UH, READ
ME MY RIGHTS OR SOMETHING?

640
00:37:45,682 --> 00:37:47,450
- STOP THE JEEP.

641
00:37:47,452 --> 00:37:48,385
- WHAT?

642
00:37:48,387 --> 00:37:50,888
- I SAID STOP THE JEEP.

643
00:38:01,179 --> 00:38:02,512
- WHERE YOU GOING?

644
00:38:02,514 --> 00:38:04,949
- BACK TO MY BOAT.

645
00:38:04,953 --> 00:38:07,088
YOU'VE BEEN LYING SINCE WE MET
AND I'M TIRED OF HEARING IT.

646
00:38:07,091 --> 00:38:08,124
- WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

647
00:38:08,126 --> 00:38:09,759
- I SAW THOSE
PHOTOS ON YOUR COMPUTER.

648
00:38:09,761 --> 00:38:12,063
SOME SORT OF SECRET
COMPLEX IN THE JUNGLE.

649
00:38:12,066 --> 00:38:15,702
YOU WANNA TELL ME
ABOUT THOSE, PAUL?

650
00:38:15,707 --> 00:38:17,008
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.

651
00:38:17,010 --> 00:38:18,477
- CASSIDY, WAIT.

652
00:38:18,479 --> 00:38:19,778
- GRAB ME AGAIN AND I'LL PUT A
HOLE IN YOUR FAVORITE SHIRT.

653
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:21,015
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

654
00:38:21,018 --> 00:38:22,784
LOOK, LOOK, I WORK FOR
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT,

655
00:38:22,786 --> 00:38:24,287
ALL RIGHT?

656
00:38:24,290 --> 00:38:25,690
I WORK FOR ECO-GROW.

657
00:38:25,692 --> 00:38:26,959
- NEVER HEARD OF 'EM.

658
00:38:26,961 --> 00:38:29,063
- IT'S AN OFFSHOOT OF THE
DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE.

659
00:38:29,066 --> 00:38:31,034
WE OFFER ENDOWMENTS
TO PRIVATE INDUSTRIES.

660
00:38:31,037 --> 00:38:32,037
THAT'S HOW DRAKE
GOT HIMSELF

661
00:38:32,039 --> 00:38:33,539
THIS PRIME PIECE
OF REAL ESTATE.

662
00:38:33,541 --> 00:38:34,974
WORD CAME BACK HE'S
BEEN OPERATING

663
00:38:34,977 --> 00:38:36,445
WAY OUT OF HIS CHARTER.

664
00:38:36,447 --> 00:38:37,547
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

665
00:38:37,549 --> 00:38:39,016
- WELL, HE-HE'S SUPPOSED
TO BE DEVELOPING

666
00:38:39,018 --> 00:38:40,618
FAST GROWN
AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS.

667
00:38:40,621 --> 00:38:42,156
BUT, WE HEAR HE'S
USING OUR FUNDING

668
00:38:42,158 --> 00:38:43,791
FOR MILITARY APPLICATIONS.

669
00:38:43,794 --> 00:38:45,895
- AND YOU'RE
INVESTIGATING HIM?

670
00:38:45,898 --> 00:38:47,566
- YOU KNOW HOW IT WAS SO EASY
FOR ME TO PICK THAT LOCK

671
00:38:47,568 --> 00:38:49,001
BACK THERE?

672
00:38:49,004 --> 00:38:52,107
'CAUSE I PICKED IT
BEFORE, SEVERAL TIMES.

673
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:53,910
- SO YOU'RE A SPY.

674
00:38:53,913 --> 00:38:57,383
- YEAH, BUT FOR
THE GOOD GUYS.

675
00:38:57,387 --> 00:38:58,420
- HOW DO I KNOW THIS IS
NOT JUST ANOTHER ONE

676
00:38:58,422 --> 00:39:00,256
OF YOUR STORIES?

677
00:39:00,259 --> 00:39:02,194
- I'VE GOT PROOF, COME ON.

678
00:39:13,719 --> 00:39:15,886
WALLA.

679
00:39:18,894 --> 00:39:20,762
- IS THAT WHAT I THINK IT IS?

680
00:39:20,765 --> 00:39:26,803
- YEP, IT'S MUSHROOM,
BIG FREAKIN' MUSHROOMS.

681
00:39:29,516 --> 00:39:31,850
- THEY MUST BE OVER
TWO STORIES TALL.

682
00:39:31,853 --> 00:39:34,121
- YEAH, THERE ABOUTS.

683
00:39:34,124 --> 00:39:35,491
- SOMETHING LIKE THIS
COULD FEED MILLIONS.

684
00:39:35,494 --> 00:39:37,128
THIS IS WONDERFUL.

685
00:39:37,130 --> 00:39:39,665
- IT WOULD BE...

686
00:39:39,669 --> 00:39:42,638
IF IT WERE THE ONLY
THING BEING GROWN.

687
00:39:49,854 --> 00:39:50,888
- IS HE THERE YET?

688
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:52,291
- NO, BUT HIS EQUIPMENT IS.

689
00:39:52,293 --> 00:39:53,926
HE'S ALREADY BEEN
LOADED ONTO A BOAT.

690
00:39:53,929 --> 00:39:55,129
- GOOD.

691
00:39:55,131 --> 00:39:57,066
I'VE ALREADY TOLD HIM
WHAT HE'S GOING AFTER.

692
00:39:57,069 --> 00:39:59,070
BUT MAKE SURE
YOU REITERATE IT.

693
00:39:59,073 --> 00:40:00,574
- SURE, SURE.

694
00:40:00,576 --> 00:40:06,414
- LISTEN, VICTORIA,
IF THIS-- HOLD ON.

695
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:08,087
YOU'RE EXCUSED, DOC.

696
00:40:08,090 --> 00:40:11,559
- I AM NOT LEAVING UNTIL YOU
TAKE YOUR HEART MEDICATION.

697
00:40:27,394 --> 00:40:30,263
- LISTEN, VICTORIA,
IF THIS DISASTER

698
00:40:30,267 --> 00:40:34,136
IS SOMEHOW LINKED BACK TO
US, OUR FIRM IS FINISHED.

699
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,974
I NEED TO KNOW YOU'RE
GONNA BE ABLE TO TIE UP

700
00:40:35,977 --> 00:40:37,378
ALL THE LOOSE ENDS.

701
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:38,913
- I'LL DO MY JOB.

702
00:40:38,916 --> 00:40:40,450
LET'S JUST HOPE THIS
BACKWARDS HILLBILLY YOU HIRED

703
00:40:40,452 --> 00:40:43,321
CAN DO HIS.

704
00:40:44,327 --> 00:40:45,193
AH, I THINK
HE'S JUST ARRIVED.

705
00:40:45,194 --> 00:40:46,127
- ALL RIGHT, I'M
COUNTING ON YOU.

706
00:40:46,129 --> 00:40:48,598
- I'LL SPEAK TO YOU LATER.

707
00:41:05,434 --> 00:41:06,600
YOU THE CAJUN?

708
00:41:06,602 --> 00:41:07,703
- WHAT GAVE IT AWAY?

709
00:41:07,705 --> 00:41:09,038
- YOU SMELL LIKE THE SWAMP.

710
00:41:09,041 --> 00:41:11,710
- YEAH, WELL I RAN
OUTTA OLD SPICE.

711
00:41:11,713 --> 00:41:12,979
- I'M VICTORIA CHASE.

712
00:41:12,981 --> 00:41:14,515
DRAKE SENT ME TO HELP OUT.

713
00:41:14,518 --> 00:41:15,518
- YOU GOT MY BOAT?

714
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,654
- IT'S OVER HERE.

715
00:41:16,656 --> 00:41:18,357
GEAR'S ON BOARD, READY TO GO.

716
00:41:18,359 --> 00:41:19,659
- HOW ABOUT THE ENGINE?

717
00:41:19,661 --> 00:41:21,795
- MODIFIED TO YOUR
SPECS AS REQUESTED.

718
00:41:21,798 --> 00:41:23,065
- PERFECT.

719
00:41:23,068 --> 00:41:25,269
I'LL BE BACK WHEN
THE JOB'S DONE.

720
00:41:25,272 --> 00:41:28,475
- YOU, UH, DO REALIZE
WHAT'S OUT THERE, DON'T YOU?

721
00:41:28,479 --> 00:41:30,580
- YEAH.

722
00:41:34,991 --> 00:41:36,091
OH, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

723
00:41:36,093 --> 00:41:36,926
- COMING WITH YOU, OF COURSE.

724
00:41:36,927 --> 00:41:38,194
- OH, NO YOU'RE NOT.

725
00:41:38,197 --> 00:41:40,899
LOOK, FOR ME
THIS IS PLAY TIME.

726
00:41:40,902 --> 00:41:42,703
BUT FOR YOU COULD
BE A NIGHTMARE.

727
00:41:42,706 --> 00:41:44,507
AND BESIDES, I WORK ALONE.

728
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:45,943
- NOT THIS TIME, COWBOY.

729
00:41:45,945 --> 00:41:48,680
MR. DRAKE, YOUR EMPLOYER
WANTS A FULL REPORT

730
00:41:48,683 --> 00:41:50,951
THE MOMENT THIS
MATTER'S RECTIFIED.

731
00:41:50,955 --> 00:41:54,291
LISTEN, SISTER, THERE'S NO WAY
YOU'RE GETTING ON THIS BOAT

732
00:41:54,295 --> 00:41:57,764
AND THAT'S FINAL.

733
00:42:14,467 --> 00:42:15,500
- YOU'RE LOVING
THIS, AREN'T YOU?

734
00:42:15,502 --> 00:42:18,704
ALL THIS NATURE CRAP?

735
00:42:21,914 --> 00:42:25,650
- YEAH, EVERYTHING IN
THE CITY IS DEAD AND COLD.

736
00:42:25,655 --> 00:42:27,490
OUT HERE IT'S
ALIVE, YOU CAN FEEL IT.

737
00:42:27,492 --> 00:42:30,460
- DAMN, YOU REALLY
ARE A HILLBILLY.

738
00:42:31,566 --> 00:42:32,833
- YOU'RE SOMETHING ELSE.

739
00:42:32,835 --> 00:42:34,135
FIRST YOU TELL ME I STINK,
NOW YOU'RE CALLING ME

740
00:42:34,138 --> 00:42:35,639
A HILLBILLY.

741
00:42:35,641 --> 00:42:37,742
YOU REALLY DON'T
HAVE TO FLIRT SO HARD.

742
00:42:37,745 --> 00:42:42,081
- DON'T FLATTER YOURSELF.

743
00:42:44,190 --> 00:42:47,159
SO, UH, DRAKE PAYING YOU A NICE
BUNDLE FOR THIS JOB THEN?

744
00:42:47,163 --> 00:42:48,831
- YEAH.

745
00:42:48,833 --> 00:42:50,634
THAT'S NOT WHY
I'M DOING IT.

746
00:42:50,637 --> 00:42:53,138
IT'S FOR THE CHALLENGE.

747
00:42:53,141 --> 00:42:55,042
- I'D RATHER HAVE THE CASH.

748
00:42:55,045 --> 00:42:58,581
- DON'T GET ME WRONG,
I'M GONNA KEEP THE CASH.

749
00:43:18,802 --> 00:43:20,436
- I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

750
00:43:20,436 --> 00:43:21,903
- FROM WHAT I GATHERED
THEY STUMBLED ON A WAY

751
00:43:21,903 --> 00:43:25,305
TO STIMULATE PLANT GROWTH BY
USING ELEMENTS FROM ANIMAL DNA.

752
00:43:25,305 --> 00:43:27,474
- WHAT KIND OF ANIMALS?

753
00:43:27,474 --> 00:43:28,206
WHAT WAS THAT?

754
00:43:28,206 --> 00:43:29,006

00:43:35,277 --> 00:43:36,043
- WAIT, WHAT'S COMING?!

760
00:43:36,043 --> 00:43:37,578
[growling]

761
00:43:37,579 --> 00:43:38,278
- THAT.

762
00:43:38,278 --> 00:43:39,078
THAT'S WHAT'S COMING.

00:43:39,079 --> 00:43:40,379

00:43:44,915 --> 00:43:47,283
- GET UP.

765
00:43:48,617 --> 00:43:53,287
- OKAY.

766
00:43:53,286 --> 00:43:55,253
GO!

767
00:44:19,633 --> 00:44:20,967
COME ON!

768
00:44:44,612 --> 00:44:46,312
- JEEZ.

769
00:45:09,491 --> 00:45:11,626
- LOOK, THERE!

770
00:45:12,993 --> 00:45:15,694
MY GOD, IS THAT IT?

771
00:45:15,693 --> 00:45:18,962
- IT'S DAMN SURE ONE OF THEM.

772
00:45:20,663 --> 00:45:22,030
MISS CHASE, YOU
WANTED ON THIS BOAT,

773
00:45:22,030 --> 00:45:23,163
YOU GOTTA EARN
YOUR KEEP.

774
00:45:23,164 --> 00:45:24,097
COME ON OVER HERE.

775
00:45:24,097 --> 00:45:25,097
TAKE THE WHEEL.

776
00:45:25,098 --> 00:45:26,298
JUST HOLD IT
STRAIGHT, ALL RIGHT?

777
00:45:26,298 --> 00:45:27,566
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

778
00:45:27,567 --> 00:45:29,635
- I'M GONNA TRY AND KILL
THAT WHILE I GOT THE CHASE.

779
00:45:51,578 --> 00:45:53,278
- AH!

780
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:55,647
DRIVE!

781
00:45:55,647 --> 00:45:56,847
DRIVE!

782
00:45:56,848 --> 00:45:58,949
- WHAT DO YOU
THINK I'M DOING?

783
00:46:04,752 --> 00:46:06,619
- WELL, THAT TOOK
CARE OF HIM FOR NOW.

784
00:46:06,619 --> 00:46:08,153
- SO?

785
00:46:08,153 --> 00:46:11,756
- SO I GUESS
PLAY TIME'S OVER.

786
00:46:41,203 --> 00:46:42,938
- SO, YOU FEELING BETTER?

787
00:46:42,938 --> 00:46:44,705
- MUCH BETTER, THANK YOU.

788
00:46:44,705 --> 00:46:46,405
- GOOD ENOUGH TO
ANSWER A FEW QUESTIONS?

789
00:46:46,405 --> 00:46:48,106
- DAD, PLEASE, SHE'S
BEEN THROUGH A LOT.

790
00:46:48,106 --> 00:46:49,774
- NO, THIS IS IMPORTANT.

791
00:46:49,774 --> 00:46:51,575
THE ENTIRE ISLAND
POPULATION IS AT RISK.

792
00:46:51,575 --> 00:46:53,341
- SO WHAT CAN YOU
TELL US, MISS, UH--

793
00:46:53,342 --> 00:46:56,311
- TAFT, KIMBERLY TAFT.

794
00:46:56,310 --> 00:46:58,879
AND UP UNTIL 36 HOURS AGO I
WORKED ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE

795
00:46:58,879 --> 00:47:01,614
OF THE ISLAND ON THE
DRAKE GAME PRESERVE.

796
00:47:01,613 --> 00:47:03,647
- AND, UH, WHAT
DID YOU DO THERE?

797
00:47:03,647 --> 00:47:05,081
- WELL, FOR THE
LAST TEN MONTHS,

798
00:47:05,082 --> 00:47:07,617
MY BROTHER STEWART AND I WERE
DEVELOPING A NEW BIOCATALYST

799
00:47:07,616 --> 00:47:09,483
TO INCREASE PLANT GROWTH.

800
00:47:09,483 --> 00:47:12,886
AND AT FIRST WE EXPERIENCE
INCREDIBLE SUCCESS.

801
00:47:12,886 --> 00:47:14,887
- YEAH, WE SAW YOU HANDIWORK
EARLIER THIS AFTERNOON.

802
00:47:14,887 --> 00:47:16,888
AMAZING.

803
00:47:16,888 --> 00:47:20,924
- BELIEVE ME, IT WAS
JUST THE BEGINNING.

804
00:47:20,923 --> 00:47:23,592
AFTER DRAKE INDUSTRIES GREEN
LIT THE PROJECT MY BROTHER

805
00:47:23,591 --> 00:47:27,560
ASSEMBLED A TEAM OF THE MOST
RENOWN MEN IN BIOTECHNOLOGY.

806
00:47:27,559 --> 00:47:30,360
DUE MAINLY TO HIS
REVOLUTIONARY DNA MATRIX,

807
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:33,897
WE WERE ABLE TO ACHIEVE
ASTOUNDING BREAKTHROUGHS.

808
00:47:33,896 --> 00:47:36,931
EVERYTHING WAS GOING ALONG
FINE, UNTIL THE DAY WE HAD

809
00:47:36,931 --> 00:47:39,967
THE VIDEO CONFERENCE
WITH CHASE AND DRAKE.

810
00:47:39,966 --> 00:47:43,334
- DOCTOR, I'D SAY
CONGRATULATIONS ARE IN ORDER.

811
00:47:43,333 --> 00:47:46,035
AFTER DUE DELIBERATION
I'VE DECIDED TO EXPAND

812
00:47:46,035 --> 00:47:47,703
YOUR LITTLE OPERATION.

813
00:47:47,703 --> 00:47:48,603
- REALLY?

814
00:47:48,604 --> 00:47:49,637
HOW SO?

815
00:47:49,637 --> 00:47:50,770
- WELL, FOR STARTERS

816
00:47:50,771 --> 00:47:52,939
WE'RE THINKING OF
TRIPLING YOUR FUNDING.

817
00:47:52,939 --> 00:47:55,540
- TRIPLING?

818
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:57,674
AND WHO DO I HAVE TO
KILL TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN?

819
00:47:57,674 --> 00:47:59,041
- NO ONE.

820
00:47:59,042 --> 00:48:02,144
NOW, ALL WE WANT FROM YOU
IS FOR YOU TO EXPLORE

821
00:48:02,143 --> 00:48:05,012
THE POTENTIAL OF
THE GROWTH MATRIX

822
00:48:05,012 --> 00:48:07,780
ON A COUPLE OF
LIVING ANIMALS.

823
00:48:07,779 --> 00:48:10,715
- WHAT SORT OF ANIMALS
ARE WE TALKING ABOUT HERE?

824
00:48:10,715 --> 00:48:18,121
- WELL, DOCTOR, NOW YOU
CAN START WITH THESE.

825
00:48:20,586 --> 00:48:21,953
- THIS IS INSANE.

826
00:48:21,953 --> 00:48:23,787
- I WAS ALWAYS AGAINST
APPLYING OUR THEORIES

827
00:48:23,787 --> 00:48:25,321
TO ANIMALS.

828
00:48:25,321 --> 00:48:28,389
BUT MY BROTHER WAS FEARFUL
OF LOOSING OUR FUNDING.

829
00:48:28,389 --> 00:48:30,124
- KIMBERLY,
PLEASE RECONSIDER.

830
00:48:30,124 --> 00:48:31,958
IMAGINE WHAT WE COULD DO
WITH THREE MILLION DOLLARS

831
00:48:31,958 --> 00:48:33,058
IN FUNDING?

832
00:48:33,059 --> 00:48:34,760
- STEW, IT JUST
DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT.

833
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:37,595
WE NEVER AGREED TO EXPERIMENT
ON LIVING CREATURES.

834
00:48:37,594 --> 00:48:38,427
- SO, WHAT DO WE DO?

835
00:48:38,428 --> 00:48:39,595
TELL HIM NO?

836
00:48:39,595 --> 00:48:41,462
SACRIFICE EVERYTHING
WE WORKED SO HARD FOR?

837
00:48:41,462 --> 00:48:44,732
- NO, WE STICK TO THE
ORIGINAL AGREEMENT.

838
00:48:44,732 --> 00:48:48,534
WE ARE HERE TO GROW FOOD, NOT
CREATE GENETIC FRANKENSTEINS.

839
00:48:48,533 --> 00:48:50,434
- AND WHAT IF HE
WON'T GO ALONG WITH US?

840
00:48:50,434 --> 00:48:52,135
- THEN I WILL PACK
MY BAGS RIGHT NOW

841
00:48:52,135 --> 00:48:53,869
AND GET ON A PLANE BACK
TO THE MAINLAND.

842
00:48:53,869 --> 00:48:55,803
- AND KILL THE PROJECT?

843
00:48:55,803 --> 00:48:57,904
KIM, I CAN'T DO
THIS WITHOUT YOU.

844
00:48:57,904 --> 00:48:59,805
PLEASE.

845
00:48:59,805 --> 00:49:01,339
- OKAY.

846
00:49:01,339 --> 00:49:02,773
OKAY.

847
00:49:02,774 --> 00:49:05,442
BUT YOU PROMISE ME, AT THE
FIRST SIGN OF TROUBLE,

848
00:49:05,441 --> 00:49:06,875
WE PULL THE PLUG.

849
00:49:06,876 --> 00:49:08,143
- FINE.

850
00:49:08,143 --> 00:49:08,843
- OKAY.

851
00:49:08,844 --> 00:49:09,744
I'LL CALL HIM RIGHT NOW.

852
00:49:09,744 --> 00:49:11,577
- GIVE ME A HUG.

853
00:49:15,412 --> 00:49:18,248
GOOD LUCK.

854
00:49:20,950 --> 00:49:24,252
- GET ME JASON
DRAKE ON THE PHONE.

855
00:49:24,251 --> 00:49:25,885
- WHAT MADE DRAKE
CHOOSE THOSE SPECIES?

856
00:49:25,885 --> 00:49:27,318
- BECAUSE THEY BOTH
ARE AMPHIBIOUS

857
00:49:27,318 --> 00:49:29,987
AND THEY HAVE A HIGH
IMMUNITY TO HUMAN DISEASES.

858
00:49:29,987 --> 00:49:32,956
DRAKE HOPED THAT THEIR
DNA COULD CREATE A VACCINE.

859
00:49:32,956 --> 00:49:35,290
A VACCINE THAT WOULD NOT
ONLY MAKE HUMANS IMMUNE

860
00:49:35,289 --> 00:49:38,825
TO BIOLOGICAL AGENTS, BUT
WOULD MAKE THEM STRONGER

861
00:49:38,825 --> 00:49:42,161
AND MORE AGILE, AS WELL.

862
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:44,728
- SOUNDS LIKE DRAKE WANTED
HIMSELF SOME SUPER SOLDIERS.

863
00:49:44,728 --> 00:49:46,729
- HE WAS TWISTING
MY BROTHER'S WORK.

864
00:49:46,729 --> 00:49:51,432
STEWART WANTED TO FEED THE
WORLD, NOT BUILD ARMIES.

865
00:49:51,430 --> 00:49:52,865
- WHAT HAPPENED NEXT?

866
00:49:52,866 --> 00:49:55,267
- WELL, WE BOMBARDED BOTH
ANIMALS FOR SEVERAL MONTHS

867
00:49:55,266 --> 00:49:58,035
IN MY BROTHERS REACTOR...

868
00:49:58,035 --> 00:50:02,071
BUT WITHOUT ANY SIGNIFICANT
RESULTS OR CHANGE.

869
00:50:02,070 --> 00:50:07,474
AND THEN TWO DAYS AGO WHEN
STEWART WENT TO FEED THEM...

870
00:50:07,472 --> 00:50:10,407
SOMETHING HAPPENED.

871
00:50:10,407 --> 00:50:12,809
SOMETHING TERRIBLE.

872
00:50:18,879 --> 00:50:20,379
EVERYBODY OUT NOW.

873
00:50:20,379 --> 00:50:24,348
IT'S ESCAPED.

874
00:51:04,835 --> 00:51:07,403
- WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON?

875
00:51:08,403 --> 00:51:10,604
- CALM DOWN.

876
00:51:12,138 --> 00:51:15,007
- NO!

877
00:51:15,006 --> 00:51:17,107
I CALLED DRAKE JUST AS
ALL HELL BROKE LOOSE

878
00:51:17,107 --> 00:51:18,340
AND HE TOLD ME
TO CALM DOWN.

879
00:51:18,341 --> 00:51:21,043
CALM DOWN?

880
00:51:21,042 --> 00:51:24,277
THE BASTARD.

881
00:51:24,277 --> 00:51:28,915
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT
THING DID TO MY BROTHER?

882
00:51:30,447 --> 00:51:35,284
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S GIVE THE
LITTLE LADY A CHANCE TO REST.

883
00:51:46,922 --> 00:51:48,055
I GOTTA GO BACK
TO THE OFFICE.

884
00:51:48,056 --> 00:51:49,023
- OKAY.

885
00:51:49,023 --> 00:51:50,190
- I'M GONNA
STICK AROUND HERE.

886
00:51:50,191 --> 00:51:52,058
- LET'S GET SOME FOOD, YEAH?

887
00:52:06,432 --> 00:52:08,433
- OH, CHAD, THIS
PLACE IS AMAZING.

888
00:52:08,433 --> 00:52:10,334
- YEAH, REALLY.

889
00:52:10,334 --> 00:52:11,935
- WELL, YOU CAN'T
SEE IT NOW, GIRLS.

890
00:52:11,935 --> 00:52:14,837
BUT IN THE MORNING I
HAVE AN INCREDIBLE VIEW

891
00:52:14,836 --> 00:52:17,971
OF A PRIVATE BEACH THAT GOES
ON FOR NEARLY HALF A MILE.

892
00:52:17,971 --> 00:52:19,304
- WOW.

893
00:52:19,304 --> 00:52:20,504
I CAN HARDLY WAIT.

894
00:52:20,505 --> 00:52:21,639
- ME, TOO.

895
00:52:21,639 --> 00:52:23,240
- WELL, LET'S RUSH
TOMORROW WHILE WE HAVE

896
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:25,608
SO MUCH WONDERFUL
BEAUTY IN THE HOUSE.

897
00:52:25,608 --> 00:52:28,176
- I'LL SECOND THAT.

898
00:52:28,176 --> 00:52:31,812
- AND I'LL THIRD THAT.

899
00:52:31,811 --> 00:52:33,846
IS THAT RIGHT?

900
00:52:33,846 --> 00:52:36,347
- ABSOLUTELY.

901
00:52:36,347 --> 00:52:38,715
COME.

902
00:52:45,084 --> 00:52:47,552
YOU KNOW, GIRLS, AFTER
SHOOTING FOR THREE MONTHS

903
00:52:47,552 --> 00:52:50,520
I REALLY NEEDED THIS.

904
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:53,356
- SO WHEN DOES THE NEW
"MANIAC MAN" COME OUT?

905
00:52:53,355 --> 00:52:55,289
- OCTOBER, AS USUAL.

906
00:52:55,289 --> 00:52:56,857
JUST ABOUT THE SAME TIME
I'LL BE PUTTING TOGETHER

907
00:52:56,857 --> 00:52:59,691
THE SCRIPT FOR NEXT
YEAR'S FOLLOW UP.

908
00:52:59,691 --> 00:53:01,092
- HOW MANY HAVE
YOU DONE SO FAR?

909
00:53:01,092 --> 00:53:04,294
- THIS WILL BE NUMBER SIX.

910
00:53:04,294 --> 00:53:06,729
- DO YOU THINK THERE MIGHT BE
SOMETHING FOR VICKIE OR ME

911
00:53:06,729 --> 00:53:08,296
IN PART SEVEN?

912
00:53:08,296 --> 00:53:11,498
- THAT ALL DEPENDS, HOW
GOOD OF A SCREAMER ARE YOU?

913
00:53:11,497 --> 00:53:12,898
- OH, I'M THE BEST.

914
00:53:12,898 --> 00:53:14,398
LISTEN.

915
00:53:14,399 --> 00:53:16,000
AH!

916
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,067
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

917
00:53:17,067 --> 00:53:18,200
- NOT BAD.

918
00:53:18,201 --> 00:53:20,569
- OH, I CAN DO
BETTER THAN THAT.

919
00:53:20,569 --> 00:53:22,603
CHECK THIS.

920
00:53:22,603 --> 00:53:25,839
AH!

921
00:53:25,838 --> 00:53:27,038
GOOD, HUH?

922
00:53:27,038 --> 00:53:28,639
- WELL, I THINK YOU
HAVE POTENTIAL, MONICA.

923
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:31,242
BUT TO REALLY MAKE YOUR
MARK IN HORROR MOVIES

924
00:53:31,241 --> 00:53:34,509
YOU'VE GOT TO
GIVE IT YOUR ALL.

925
00:53:34,509 --> 00:53:35,943
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

926
00:53:35,943 --> 00:53:38,912
- WELL, AS I TELL MY
ACTRESSES ON SET,

927
00:53:38,911 --> 00:53:43,148
YOU'VE GOT TO THINK OF THE
WORST NIGHTMARE IMAGINABLE.

928
00:53:43,147 --> 00:53:47,250
FEEL THE FEAR DEEP
WITHIN YOUR SOUL.

929
00:53:47,249 --> 00:53:52,419
OPEN YOUR EYES, LOOK UP, AND
SCREAM LIKE YOUR ENTIRE LIFE

930
00:53:52,418 --> 00:53:54,452
DEPENDED ON IT.

931
00:53:54,452 --> 00:53:55,653
[growling]

932
00:53:55,653 --> 00:53:57,620
- WHAT WAS THAT?

933
00:54:00,592 --> 00:54:03,015
- AAAH!

934
00:54:35,513 --> 00:54:36,581
- SECOND FLOOR.

935
00:54:36,581 --> 00:54:37,714
- YES, THIS IS DR. RHODES.

936
00:54:37,715 --> 00:54:39,649
WE NEED TO DO AN
ICU, IMMEDIATELY.

937
00:54:39,649 --> 00:54:40,849
- DR. RHODES?

938
00:54:40,849 --> 00:54:42,617
- YES, FROM MOLOKAI GENERAL.

939
00:54:42,617 --> 00:54:44,350
- RIGHT AWAY.

940
00:55:22,166 --> 00:55:23,033
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

941
00:55:23,034 --> 00:55:24,301
- SOMETHING BAD.

942
00:55:24,301 --> 00:55:26,035
- NO!

943
00:55:41,441 --> 00:55:43,109
- HEY, WHAT'S
GOING ON HERE?

944
00:56:17,057 --> 00:56:17,924
- PAUL, WHAT'S GOING ON?

945
00:56:17,924 --> 00:56:18,690
ARE YOU OKAY?

946
00:56:18,691 --> 00:56:20,191
- WHAT HAPPENED?

947
00:56:20,191 --> 00:56:23,060
- THAT GIRL OF
YOURS, SHE KILLED HER.

948
00:56:23,059 --> 00:56:24,093
- WHERE IS SHE NOW?

949
00:56:24,094 --> 00:56:24,860
- I DON'T KNOW.

950
00:56:24,860 --> 00:56:26,494
SHE MUST
HAVE RUN OUT.

951
00:56:26,495 --> 00:56:27,394
- I'M GOING AFTER HER.

952
00:56:27,394 --> 00:56:28,528
- OKAY.

953
00:56:34,331 --> 00:56:38,801
[phone rings]

954
00:56:44,836 --> 00:56:45,802
- HELLO.

955
00:56:45,802 --> 00:56:46,969
- MARK, I AM SORRY
TO WAKE YOU,

956
00:56:46,970 --> 00:56:49,471
BUT I JUST RAN INTO SOME
BIG TROUBLE OUT HERE.

957
00:56:49,470 --> 00:56:50,838
- YEAH, PAUL, WHAT'S UP?

958
00:56:50,839 --> 00:56:52,339
- WELL, DRAKE DID
EXACTLY WHAT I THOUGHT.

959
00:56:52,339 --> 00:56:54,641
HE CREATED SOME GIANT MONSTER
IN THAT THINK TANK OF HIS

960
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:55,873
AND THEY'VE GOTTEN LOOSE.

961
00:56:55,874 --> 00:56:57,307
- POSITIVE?

962
00:56:57,307 --> 00:56:58,241
- I'M MORE THAN POSITIVE.

963
00:56:58,241 --> 00:56:59,608
I WAS NEARLY
TRAMPLED BY ONE

964
00:56:59,609 --> 00:57:01,644
AFTER I RAN INTO ONE
OF HIS GENETICISTS.

965
00:57:01,643 --> 00:57:06,947
SHE SPILLED THE BEANS ON THE
WHOLE STORY AFTER WE ESCAPED.

966
00:57:06,945 --> 00:57:07,878
- OKAY, LOOK, WE HAVE TO
GET HER IN FRONT OF THE, UH,

967
00:57:07,879 --> 00:57:09,847
COMMITTEE TO TESTIFY.

968
00:57:09,847 --> 00:57:11,047
HOW SOON CAN
YOU GET HER HERE?

969
00:57:11,047 --> 00:57:12,014
- WELL, I CAN'T.

970
00:57:12,014 --> 00:57:13,848
SHE'S DEAD.

971
00:57:13,848 --> 00:57:14,948
- HOW'D THAT HAPPEN?

972
00:57:14,949 --> 00:57:16,415
- ONE OF DRAKE'S
PEOPLE DID IT.

973
00:57:16,415 --> 00:57:18,250
NEARLY TOOK ME
OUT IN THE PROCESS.

974
00:57:18,250 --> 00:57:19,717
- SO WE GOT NOTHING.

975
00:57:19,717 --> 00:57:21,084
- ACTUALLY, BEFORE SHE DIED

976
00:57:21,084 --> 00:57:22,785
I RECORDED EVERYTHING SHE
HAD TO SAY ON VIDEO.

977
00:57:22,785 --> 00:57:24,318
SO, I THINK WE'VE GOT
MORE THAN ENOUGH

978
00:57:24,318 --> 00:57:26,887
TO PUT DRAKE AWAY
FOR A VERY LONG TIME.

979
00:57:26,887 --> 00:57:29,155
- GOOD, SEND ME AN
MP4 OF THAT RIGHT AWAY.

980
00:57:29,155 --> 00:57:30,388
I'LL GET IT
OVER TO ROBERTSON.

981
00:57:30,388 --> 00:57:31,722
- ALL RIGHT, WILL DO.

982
00:57:31,722 --> 00:57:34,024
OH, HAVE THE BUREAU PUT
OUT AN ALL POINTS ON A WOMAN

983
00:57:34,024 --> 00:57:35,691
NAMED VICTORIA CHASE.

984
00:57:35,691 --> 00:57:36,758
- WHO'S SHE?

985
00:57:36,758 --> 00:57:38,759
- SHE'S THE WOMAN
WHO TRIED TO KILL ME.

986
00:57:38,759 --> 00:57:40,126
I THINK SHE'S PROBABLY
SKIPPED THE ISLAND BY NOW.

987
00:57:40,126 --> 00:57:42,027
PROBABLY ON HER WAY
BACK TO SEE DRAKE.

988
00:57:42,027 --> 00:57:44,327
- OKAY, I'LL
HANDLE HER PERSONALLY.

989
00:57:44,327 --> 00:57:45,528
YOU TAKE CARE
OF YOURSELF.

990
00:57:45,528 --> 00:57:46,261
WATCH YOUR SIX.

991
00:57:46,262 --> 00:57:46,995
- ALL RIGHT, THANKS.

992
00:57:46,995 --> 00:57:48,696
- ALL RIGHT.

993
00:57:57,134 --> 00:57:58,734
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

994
00:57:58,734 --> 00:58:00,434
- I'M EXTRACTING SOME DATA.

995
00:58:00,434 --> 00:58:03,704
TURNING KIM'S
TESTIMONY INTO AN MP4.

996
00:58:08,938 --> 00:58:10,605
- DAD, WHAT'D YOU FIND OUT?

997
00:58:10,605 --> 00:58:12,140
- CYANIDE.

998
00:58:12,140 --> 00:58:14,607
ENOUGH IN HER TO
KILL 20 PEOPLE.

999
00:58:14,607 --> 00:58:17,409
- I HOPE YOUR DEPUTIES
FOUND THE BITCH WHO DID THIS.

1000
00:58:17,408 --> 00:58:18,909
- YOU AIN'T GONNA FIND HER.

1001
00:58:18,909 --> 00:58:20,543
THAT GIRL'S A SNAKE.

1002
00:58:20,543 --> 00:58:22,844
SHE KNOWS HOW TO SLITHER
AWAY OUT OF TIGHT SPOTS.

1003
00:58:22,844 --> 00:58:25,012
SHE'S PROBABLY HALF WAY
TO THE MAINLAND BY NOW.

1004
00:58:25,012 --> 00:58:26,813
- SO WHAT ARE YOU SAYING,
WE SHOULD JUST LET HER GO?

1005
00:58:26,813 --> 00:58:28,313
- NO, I'M SAYING WE SHOULD
DEAL WITH THOSE TWO LIZARDS

1006
00:58:28,313 --> 00:58:29,547
RIGHT NOW.

1007
00:58:29,547 --> 00:58:31,481
OTHERWISE THAT LADY
DIED FOR NOTHING.

1008
00:58:31,481 --> 00:58:33,248
- SOUNDS LIKE A JOB
FOR THE MILITARY.

1009
00:58:33,248 --> 00:58:35,416
- FIRSTLY, NOBODY IN THE
MILITARY'S GONNA BELIEVE YOU.

1010
00:58:35,416 --> 00:58:37,785
AND SECONDLY,
SOLDIERS AIN'T NO GOOD.

1011
00:58:37,784 --> 00:58:38,884
I KNOW LIZARDS.

1012
00:58:38,885 --> 00:58:40,485
THEY'RE PRETTY SMART.

1013
00:58:40,485 --> 00:58:41,752
THEY KNOW WHEN
THEY'RE BEING HUNTED.

1014
00:58:41,752 --> 00:58:43,586
THEY GONNA HUNKER
DOWN AND LAY LOW.

1015
00:58:43,586 --> 00:58:46,421
THEY CAN GO WEEKS WITHOUT
EATING AND THEN JUST WHEN YOU

1016
00:58:46,420 --> 00:58:50,123
EASE UP AND YOU STOP LOOKING
THEY'RE BACK WITH VENGEANCE.

1017
00:58:50,122 --> 00:58:54,659
- SO WHAT DO YOU PROPOSE?

1018
00:58:57,993 --> 00:59:01,461
- ALLIGATOR AND
CROCODILE AND MORTAL ENEMIES.

1019
00:59:01,460 --> 00:59:03,696
I SAY WE BRING
'EM TOGETHER.

1020
00:59:03,696 --> 00:59:06,130
WE MAKE 'EM FIGHT.

1021
00:59:06,129 --> 00:59:08,597
AND THEN HOPEFULLY WE
CAN TAKE OUT THE WINNER

1022
00:59:08,597 --> 00:59:12,633
WHEN IT'S MOST
VULNERABLE.

1023
00:59:13,766 --> 00:59:16,902
- SO, HOW DO YOU
PROPOSE WE DO THAT?

1024
00:59:31,973 --> 00:59:32,907
ALL SET?

1025
00:59:32,908 --> 00:59:34,942
- EVERYTHING'S
ON BOARD, SIR.

1026
00:59:47,847 --> 00:59:49,480
- WHAT'S GOING ON THERE?

1027
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:51,548
- JUST, UH, SENDING
SOME HATE MAIL.

1028
00:59:51,548 --> 00:59:53,983
- WHAT?

1029
00:59:53,983 --> 00:59:56,685
- NOTHING, I-I'LL
TELL YOU ABOUT IT LATER.

1030
00:59:56,684 --> 01:00:00,620
- YOU KNOW, SON, YOU LOOK LIKE
A DAMN FOOL IN THAT SHIRT.

1031
01:00:00,619 --> 01:00:02,486
ALL THE INSTRUMENTS ARE
LOADED ON THE CHOPPERS.

1032
01:00:02,486 --> 01:00:04,287
- THANKS, SHERIFF.

1033
01:00:04,287 --> 01:00:05,654
- WHAT KIND OF
RIG IS IT, LOGAN?

1034
01:00:05,654 --> 01:00:07,923
- IT'S A FLIR DOUBLE A Q-26.

1035
01:00:07,923 --> 01:00:09,423
- NICE.

1036
01:00:09,423 --> 01:00:12,358
- UH, EXCUSE ME, SOME OF
US DON'T SPEAK TECHNO-NERD.

1037
01:00:12,357 --> 01:00:15,059
- SORRY, A FLIR IS SHORT
FOR FORWARD LOOKING INFRARED.

1038
01:00:15,059 --> 01:00:18,161
IT DETECTS WARM OBJECTS BY
MEASURING THERMAL ENERGY.

1039
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:19,194
- YOU MEAN LIKE
POLICE HELICOPTERS

1040
01:00:19,194 --> 01:00:20,627
USE TO TRACK
CRIMINALS AT NIGHT?

1041
01:00:20,628 --> 01:00:22,129
- EXACTLY.

1042
01:00:22,129 --> 01:00:23,429
SEE THEM LIZARDS, THEY MIGHT BE
ABLE TO HIDE UNDER A PALM TREE

1043
01:00:23,429 --> 01:00:25,296
OR IN THE WATER, BUT THEY
AIN'T GONNA HIDE FROM THIS.

1044
01:00:25,296 --> 01:00:26,764
NOW WE FLY OVER THEM,

1045
01:00:26,764 --> 01:00:28,898
THE HEAT SIGNATURE'S GONNA
SHOW UP ON THE SCREEN.

1046
01:00:28,898 --> 01:00:30,232
- IT STILL DOESN'T EXPLAIN
HOW YOU'RE GONNA GET 'EM

1047
01:00:30,232 --> 01:00:31,632
INTO THE RING.

1048
01:00:31,632 --> 01:00:33,700
- A GATOR AND A CROCODILE ARE
REALLY SENSITIVE TO SOUND.

1049
01:00:33,700 --> 01:00:36,068
SO ONCE WE LOCATE EXACTLY
WHERE THEY ARE WE'LL SURROUND

1050
01:00:36,068 --> 01:00:39,303
THEM USING EXPLOSIVES
AND DRIVE 'EM TOGETHER.

1051
01:00:39,302 --> 01:00:41,470
- HOPEFULLY NOT TO
THE CENTER OF TOWN.

1052
01:00:41,470 --> 01:00:43,271
- HOPEFULLY NOT.

1053
01:00:43,271 --> 01:00:45,372
WELL, FIRST THING WE
GOTTA DO IS FIND THEM.

1054
01:00:45,371 --> 01:00:46,038
WE CAN'T DO
THAT SITTING HERE.

1055
01:00:46,039 --> 01:00:48,073
SO, LET'S SADDLE UP.

1056
01:00:52,742 --> 01:00:54,275
- GOOD LUCK, PARTNER.

1057
01:00:57,244 --> 01:00:58,978
- LISTEN, I CALLED
IN ALL MY MEN TODAY

1058
01:00:58,978 --> 01:01:01,279
AND DEPUTIZED
SOME RANCHERS.

1059
01:01:02,579 --> 01:01:05,181
JUST LET ME KNOW WHERE THEY
ARE WE'LL GET AFTER THEM.

1060
01:01:10,249 --> 01:01:12,617
- SOUNDS GOOD.

1061
01:01:12,617 --> 01:01:16,253
SURE YOU DON'T WANNA TAKE A
NICE SCENIC HELICOPTER RIDE?

1062
01:01:24,388 --> 01:01:26,322
- I'LL BE MORE HELP ON
THE GROUND WITH MY DAD.

1063
01:01:26,322 --> 01:01:27,857
- ALL RIGHT.

1064
01:01:27,857 --> 01:01:31,459
WELL, UH, YOU TAKE CARE
OF YOURSELF, OFFICER.

1065
01:01:31,458 --> 01:01:34,293
- COME HERE.

1066
01:01:38,594 --> 01:01:41,897
- CRAP, I DON'T NEED
TO SEE THIS, COME ON.

1067
01:01:42,753 --> 01:01:44,403
- OKAY.

1068
01:01:53,184 --> 01:01:55,901
¶       ¶... 

1069
01:03:56,260 --> 01:03:57,560
- AND HERE WE ARE
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

1070
01:03:57,563 --> 01:03:59,731
AT THE FAMED COCO
PALMS HOTEL.

1071
01:03:59,734 --> 01:04:03,537
BUILT OVER FIVE DECADES
AGO IN 1953 THE RESORT

1072
01:04:03,543 --> 01:04:07,479
ULTIMATELY EXPANDED
TO OVER 400 ROOMS.

1073
01:04:07,485 --> 01:04:09,820
IT BECAME THE PREMIER
HOTEL ON THE ISLAND

1074
01:04:09,824 --> 01:04:15,529
BEFORE HURRICANE NIKKI
LEFT IT IN RUINS IN 1992.

1075
01:04:22,987 --> 01:04:24,988
DURING IT'S HEYDAY WITH
ITS LUSH GREEN SCENERY

1076
01:04:24,991 --> 01:04:28,361
AND IT'S WHITE SANDY BEACHES
IT BROUGHT HOLLYWOOD ICONS

1077
01:04:28,367 --> 01:04:32,302
LIKE BING CROSBY, FRANK SINATRA,
AND YES, EVEN ELVIS PRESLEY

1078
01:04:32,308 --> 01:04:33,576
TO THE RESORT.

1079
01:04:33,578 --> 01:04:35,579
- OH, WHAT ROOM DID
THE KING STAY IN?

1080
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:37,316
- I KNEW SOMEONE WAS
GOING TO ASK THAT.

1081
01:04:37,319 --> 01:04:39,488
HE HAD ONE OF THE
PRIVATE CABANAS IN THE BACK.

1082
01:04:39,492 --> 01:04:41,860
BUT, WE'LL SEE THAT IN
JUST A LITTLE BIT, OKAY?

1083
01:04:41,864 --> 01:04:43,865
- OH, IT ALMOST MAKES
COMING HERE WORTH IT.

1084
01:04:45,037 --> 01:04:46,004
- OKAY, BAM-BAM, COME ON.

1085
01:04:46,006 --> 01:04:48,541
LET'S GO NOW.

1086
01:05:07,455 --> 01:05:08,521
- ANYTHING?

1087
01:05:08,524 --> 01:05:10,625
- NOTHING SO FAR.

1088
01:05:20,986 --> 01:05:23,420
WAIT A MINUTE,
I THINK I GOT SOMETHING.

1089
01:05:23,424 --> 01:05:25,392
OH, YEAH, THIS HEAT
SIGNATURE IS WAY TOO BIG

1090
01:05:25,395 --> 01:05:27,029
TO BE ANYTHING HUMAN.

1091
01:05:27,032 --> 01:05:28,600
- WHAT'S YOUR POSITION?

1092
01:05:28,603 --> 01:05:31,004
- JUST OVER THE NORTHWEST
CORNER OF THE ISLAND

1093
01:05:31,008 --> 01:05:34,544
RIGHT OVER
THE OLD SUGAR FACTORY.

1094
01:05:36,487 --> 01:05:40,356
GARDNER, CAN YOU TAKE
THIS THING DOWN ANY LOWER?

1095
01:05:43,069 --> 01:05:45,771
- NO WAY I'M GONNA
LAND NEXT TO THAT THING.

1096
01:05:47,880 --> 01:05:49,247
- DO YOU SEE THAT, LOGAN?

1097
01:05:49,249 --> 01:05:50,416
- I HAVE A VISUAL.

1098
01:05:50,419 --> 01:05:52,053
- WELL, WHAT NOW?

1099
01:05:52,056 --> 01:05:53,623
- LET'S GET BACK
TO THE HANGER.

1100
01:05:53,626 --> 01:05:55,561
I'LL GET MY EXPLOSIVE
AND A FOUR BY FOUR.

1101
01:05:55,564 --> 01:05:57,898
WE'LL TAKE CARE OF THAT
THING ONCE AND FOR ALL.

1102
01:05:59,105 --> 01:06:01,139
- WAIT A MINUTE, I THINK
I'VE GOT A BETTER IDEA.

1103
01:06:01,143 --> 01:06:02,177
- WHAT'S THAT?

1104
01:06:02,179 --> 01:06:04,013
- I'LL TELL YA
BACK AT BASE CAMP.

1105
01:06:15,509 --> 01:06:16,943
- WHAT DO YOU GOT?

1106
01:06:16,946 --> 01:06:19,247
- THAT SUGAR FACTORY SITS
IN THE MIDDLE OF A VALLEY

1107
01:06:19,251 --> 01:06:21,419
AND THE ONLY WAY IN OR OUT
IS THROUGH A TUNNEL UP

1108
01:06:21,422 --> 01:06:22,889
THROUGH THE SIDE
OF THE MOUNTAIN.

1109
01:06:22,892 --> 01:06:24,860
NOW IF WE COULD FIND THAT
GATOR, DRIVE HIM IN THERE

1110
01:06:24,864 --> 01:06:26,999
AND BLOW THE TUNNEL CLOSED,
THERE'D BE NO WAY TO ESCAPE,

1111
01:06:27,002 --> 01:06:28,035
THEY'D HAVE TO FIGHT.

1112
01:06:28,038 --> 01:06:28,904
- I LIKE IT.

1113
01:06:28,906 --> 01:06:30,073
I LIKE IT.

1114
01:06:30,075 --> 01:06:30,942
I'VE GOT ENOUGH C-4 IN
MY SUPPLIES TO START

1115
01:06:30,944 --> 01:06:32,477
A FULL SCALE LANDSLIDE.

1116
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:34,982
I'M GONNA NEED SOMEBODY TO
HELP ME SET THE CHARGES.

1117
01:06:34,987 --> 01:06:36,587
- I LOVE BLOWING UP TUNNELS.

1118
01:06:36,590 --> 01:06:38,324
IT'S A HOBBY OF MINE.

1119
01:06:38,327 --> 01:06:39,662
- YOU'RE FULL OF SURPRISES.

1120
01:06:39,665 --> 01:06:40,597
HOW ABOUT THAT SHERIFF?

1121
01:06:40,599 --> 01:06:42,000
YOU HEAR FROM HIM
ABOUT THAT GATOR?

1122
01:06:42,002 --> 01:06:44,270
- HE'S GOT ALL HIS UNITS OUT
LOOKING BUT SO FAR NOTHING.

1123
01:06:44,274 --> 01:06:45,440
- WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME.

1124
01:06:45,443 --> 01:06:46,610
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

1125
01:06:46,612 --> 01:06:48,213
- WELL, IT'S PAST NOON.

1126
01:06:48,216 --> 01:06:52,319
THOSE LIZARDS THEY HUNT ON
THE HOTTEST PART OF THE DAY.

1127
01:06:52,326 --> 01:06:55,461
- WHERE WOULD IT ATTACK?

1128
01:06:55,466 --> 01:06:57,601
- WHEREVER THERE'S PEOPLE.

1129
01:07:05,422 --> 01:07:08,424
- OKAY, COME ON,
GATHER AROUND.

1130
01:07:09,899 --> 01:07:12,467
THE COCO PALMS RESORT
ACHIEVED EARLY EXPOSURE

1131
01:07:12,471 --> 01:07:17,075
AND FAME IN THE 1958 FILM,
"SHE-GODS OF SHARK REEF."

1132
01:07:17,082 --> 01:07:19,951
VIRTUALLY, THE ENTIRE CLIMAX
OF THE MOVIE WAS SHOT

1133
01:07:19,956 --> 01:07:23,058
RIGHT HERE ON THE GROUNDS
OR NEAR THE HOTEL.

1134
01:07:23,063 --> 01:07:23,863
- I REMEMBER THAT FILM.

1135
01:07:23,865 --> 01:07:25,065
IT WAS A LOT OF FUN.

1136
01:07:25,067 --> 01:07:27,068
BUT WHERE'S THIS ELVIS
ROOM YOU SPOKE ABOUT?

1137
01:07:27,072 --> 01:07:28,472
- I KNOW, DON'T WORRY.

1138
01:07:28,474 --> 01:07:30,809
I PROMISE WE'RE
GETTING THERE.

1139
01:07:30,813 --> 01:07:33,181
NOW, IF YOU'LL ALL
FOLLOW ME, PLEASE.

1140
01:07:33,185 --> 01:07:35,186
COME ON.

1141
01:08:40,238 --> 01:08:42,039
- ALL RIGHT, BEST WAY TO
TAKE THIS THING DOWN IS--

1142
01:08:42,042 --> 01:08:43,275
- HIT THE STRESS POINTS.

1143
01:08:43,277 --> 01:08:45,345
- EXACTLY.

1144
01:08:45,349 --> 01:08:48,017
- DRAKE, HE'S GONNA HAVE
TO PAY FOR WHAT HE DID.

1145
01:08:48,021 --> 01:08:49,588
- HE WILL.

1146
01:08:49,591 --> 01:08:51,659
I EMAILED KIM'S TESTIMONY
THAT I VIDEO TAPED

1147
01:08:51,663 --> 01:08:53,297
TO A FRIEND OF MINE.

1148
01:08:53,300 --> 01:08:55,268
- WHAT KIND OF FRIEND?

1149
01:08:55,272 --> 01:08:57,974
- THE SERIOUS KIND.

1150
01:09:04,626 --> 01:09:05,926
- ANY WORD FROM HAWAII?

1151
01:09:05,928 --> 01:09:06,928
- JUST THAT THERE'S
PROBABILITY

1152
01:09:06,931 --> 01:09:09,566
THAT SHE'LL
SHOW UP HERE.

1153
01:09:12,276 --> 01:09:13,477
- AND WHAT DO
WE HAVE HERE?

1154
01:09:13,480 --> 01:09:15,381
FEMALE DRIVER,
LATE MODEL SEDAN.

1155
01:09:15,384 --> 01:09:16,617
- IT'S GOTTA BE OUR GIRL.

1156
01:09:16,620 --> 01:09:18,754
- LET'S GO.

1157
01:09:36,365 --> 01:09:37,865
- VICTORIA, WHAT
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

1158
01:09:37,868 --> 01:09:40,303
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE ON
THE ISLAND HELPING THE CAJUN.

1159
01:09:40,307 --> 01:09:41,274
- I CAUGHT THE
REDEYE CHARTER.

1160
01:09:41,276 --> 01:09:44,111
GOT IN ABOUT AN HOUR AGO.

1161
01:09:50,263 --> 01:09:51,464
- WHAT'S WRONG?

1162
01:09:51,466 --> 01:09:53,300
- HAD A LITTLE TROUBLE
CLEARING UP YOUR MESS.

1163
01:09:53,303 --> 01:09:55,337
ALL THANKS TO
THAT HICK YOU HIRED.

1164
01:10:04,562 --> 01:10:06,830
- FREEZE, FBI.

1165
01:10:06,834 --> 01:10:09,936
PUT YOUR HANDS OUT
WHERE I CAN SEE THEM.

1166
01:10:11,210 --> 01:10:14,446
- OFFICER, THERE-THERE
MUST BE SOME MISTAKE HERE.

1167
01:10:14,451 --> 01:10:16,385
- THAT'S RIGHT, MR. DRAKE,
AND YOU MADE IT.

1168
01:10:16,389 --> 01:10:17,956
YOU'VE BEEN UNDER
INVESTIGATION FOR THE ABUSE

1169
01:10:17,959 --> 01:10:20,528
OF GENETIC ENGINEERING
REGULATIONS FOR MONTHS NOW.

1170
01:10:20,532 --> 01:10:22,666
WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY EVIDENCE
UNTIL WE RECEIVED AN EMAIL

1171
01:10:22,670 --> 01:10:24,871
THAT CONTAINED THE VIDEO
DEPOSITION OF ONE,

1172
01:10:24,874 --> 01:10:26,575
KIMBERLY TAFT.

1173
01:10:26,579 --> 01:10:28,180
DOES THAT NAME
RING A BELL?

1174
01:10:28,183 --> 01:10:29,683
- SHE WAS FOUND MURDERED
LAST NIGHT IN HAWAII.

1175
01:10:29,686 --> 01:10:32,688
AND GUESS WHO THE
PRIME SUSPECT IS?

1176
01:10:33,728 --> 01:10:36,197
- OW.

1177
01:10:36,201 --> 01:10:38,868
- AH.

1178
01:10:43,550 --> 01:10:44,584
- MR. DRAKE, ARE YOU OKAY?

1179
01:10:44,587 --> 01:10:45,286
ARE YOU HIT?

1180
01:10:45,287 --> 01:10:46,087
- NO.

1181
01:10:46,089 --> 01:10:47,956
NO, IT-IT'S MY HEART.

1182
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:49,294
- OKAY, I'LL GET SOME HELP.

1183
01:10:49,296 --> 01:10:51,598
WHAT ABOUT HER?

1184
01:10:53,773 --> 01:10:56,141
YEAH, I'M GONNA NEED MEDAVAC
ASAP, POSSIBLE HEART ATTACK

1185
01:10:56,145 --> 01:10:59,180
AND, UH, SEND A
MEAT WAGON.

1186
01:10:59,185 --> 01:11:00,319
- WHAT'S GOING ON DOWN THERE?

1187
01:11:00,321 --> 01:11:02,556
- FREEZE, WHO ARE YOU?

1188
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:03,993
- I'M MR. DRAKE'S NURSE.

1189
01:11:03,996 --> 01:11:04,829
- YOU'RE HIS NURSE?

1190
01:11:04,831 --> 01:11:06,165
GET DOWN HERE.

1191
01:11:06,168 --> 01:11:07,369
HE'S IN TROUBLE.

1192
01:11:07,371 --> 01:11:10,406
COME ON, OVER HERE.

1193
01:11:12,349 --> 01:11:13,416
YES, SAME ADDRESS.

1194
01:11:13,418 --> 01:11:15,419
- MR. DRAKE!

1195
01:11:15,423 --> 01:11:17,658
OH, GOD, KEEP BREATHING.

1196
01:11:17,662 --> 01:11:19,396
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.

1197
01:11:19,399 --> 01:11:20,465
OH, NO.

1198
01:11:20,467 --> 01:11:22,435
OH, NO.

1199
01:11:31,793 --> 01:11:34,894
- PAUL, WHAT'S YOUR 20?

1200
01:11:34,899 --> 01:11:37,167
- BUSY SETTING CHARGES WE'RE
AT THE OLD KULOA TUNNEL.

1201
01:11:37,171 --> 01:11:38,171
ANY NEWS ON THE GATOR?

1202
01:11:38,174 --> 01:11:39,141
- NOTHING SO FAR.

1203
01:11:39,143 --> 01:11:40,877
I'M HOPING IT
STAYS THAT WAY.

1204
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:45,250
- YOU AND ME BOTH.

1205
01:11:50,100 --> 01:11:50,666
- OKAY, COME ON, FOLKS.

1206
01:11:50,667 --> 01:11:52,802
THIS WAY, PLEASE.

1207
01:11:54,472 --> 01:11:56,039
ALL RIGHT, GATHER
AROUND, GATHER AROUND.

1208
01:11:56,040 --> 01:11:57,607
THANK YOU.

1209
01:11:57,608 --> 01:12:00,277
- NOW THE COCO PALMS
RESORT HAS MANY TRADITIONS.

1210
01:12:00,279 --> 01:12:02,580
ONE OF THEM BEING THE
CEREMONIAL TORCH LIGHTING

1211
01:12:02,581 --> 01:12:05,250
ALSO KNOWN AS
THE CALL TO FEAST.

1212
01:12:05,251 --> 01:12:07,685
EVEN TODAY MANY RESORTS
ON THE ISLAND CHAIN,

1213
01:12:07,687 --> 01:12:09,588
CONTINUE THIS TRADITION.

1214
01:12:09,589 --> 01:12:11,157
- THAT'S GREAT.

1215
01:12:11,158 --> 01:12:13,592
BUT IS THAT THE ELVIS ROOM
YOU TOLD US ABOUT OVER THERE?

1216
01:12:13,594 --> 01:12:14,828
- NO, IT'S NOT.

1217
01:12:14,829 --> 01:12:16,496
THE ONE YOU'RE LOOKING
FOR IS OVER THERE,

1218
01:12:16,497 --> 01:12:19,232
THE LAST ONE
TO THE RIGHT.

1219
01:12:19,234 --> 01:12:21,269
- BOB, LET'S GO
CHECK IT--

1220
01:12:21,270 --> 01:12:24,205
- AH!

1221
01:12:53,473 --> 01:12:55,208
- THERE, THE COCO PALMS.

1222
01:12:55,209 --> 01:12:58,077
I THINK WE GOT TROUBLE.

1223
01:13:03,385 --> 01:13:05,920
THIS IS SWANSON,
COCO PALMS HOTEL.

1224
01:13:05,921 --> 01:13:07,655
GATOR MUST BE
AROUND HERE SOMEWHERE.

1225
01:13:07,656 --> 01:13:10,225
WE NEED BACK UP
IMMEDIATELY.

1226
01:13:12,395 --> 01:13:14,096
YOU READY FOR THIS?

1227
01:13:14,097 --> 01:13:15,430
- I'M YOUR
DAUGHTER AREN'T I?

1228
01:13:15,432 --> 01:13:16,766
- DAMN RIGHT YOU ARE.

1229
01:13:16,767 --> 01:13:18,168
I'M LUCKY TO HAVE YOU.

1230
01:13:18,169 --> 01:13:19,135
I SHOULD TELL
YOU MORE OFTEN,

1231
01:13:19,136 --> 01:13:20,904
BUT I'M A CRANKY
SON OF A BITCH.

1232
01:13:20,905 --> 01:13:21,872
- DAD...

1233
01:13:21,874 --> 01:13:23,540
- SAVE IT, CAS'.

1234
01:13:23,541 --> 01:13:25,509
WE'VE GOT
WORK TO DO.

1235
01:13:45,400 --> 01:13:47,701
CRAP.

1236
01:14:04,355 --> 01:14:05,923
CAS' TAKE THIS.

1237
01:14:05,925 --> 01:14:07,058
GET IT STARTED.

1238
01:14:07,059 --> 01:14:08,326
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

1239
01:14:08,327 --> 01:14:09,660
- DAD, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

1240
01:14:09,661 --> 01:14:11,429
- GIVING IT SOMETHING
TO REMEMBER ME BY.

1241
01:14:11,431 --> 01:14:12,364
- DAD, NO.

1242
01:14:12,365 --> 01:14:13,232
DAD, NO, LET'S
GO TO THE CAR.

1243
01:14:13,233 --> 01:14:13,933
- CAS', GET OUTTA HERE.

1244
01:14:13,934 --> 01:14:14,633
- DAD, COME ON.

1245
01:14:14,634 --> 01:14:16,468
- GET OUTTA HERE, NOW!

1246
01:14:21,608 --> 01:14:23,876
HERE'S LOOKING
AT YOU, KID.

1247
01:14:40,664 --> 01:14:41,797
- NO!

1248
01:14:43,969 --> 01:14:46,203
DAD!

1249
01:15:09,198 --> 01:15:11,232
NO.

1250
01:15:12,134 --> 01:15:14,202
DAD.

1251
01:15:48,143 --> 01:15:49,876
- I PLANTED SIX
CHARGES, TEN FEET APART.

1252
01:15:49,877 --> 01:15:50,644
- ALL RIGHT, GOOD.

1253
01:15:50,645 --> 01:15:51,678
I PLANTED FIVE.

1254
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:53,113
- WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE LAST ONE?

1255
01:15:53,115 --> 01:15:56,284
- INSURANCE.

1256
01:15:58,655 --> 01:15:59,955
- PAUL, YOU READING ME?

1257
01:15:59,956 --> 01:16:01,390
- CASSIDY WHAT'S HAPPENING?

1258
01:16:01,391 --> 01:16:02,724
- YOU GOT THOSE
CHARGES READY?

1259
01:16:02,725 --> 01:16:03,959
- JUST FINISHING UP NOW, WHY?

1260
01:16:03,960 --> 01:16:04,960
- I'M HEADING YOUR WAY

1261
01:16:04,962 --> 01:16:06,963
AND I'M BRINGING
THE GATOR WITH ME.

1262
01:16:06,964 --> 01:16:08,331
- YOU MEAN THAT
THING'S CHASING YOU?

1263
01:16:08,332 --> 01:16:09,132
CAS', DON'T DO THIS.

1264
01:16:09,133 --> 01:16:10,467
GET OFF THE ROAD NOW.

1265
01:16:10,468 --> 01:16:12,135
- MY DAD'S DEAD, PAUL.

1266
01:16:12,137 --> 01:16:14,338
THAT THING KILLED HIM.

1267
01:16:14,339 --> 01:16:15,739
SO NOW I'M GONNA KILL IT.

1268
01:16:15,740 --> 01:16:16,874
- CAS'--

1269
01:16:16,875 --> 01:16:18,209
- I'LL LEAD THAT
MONSTER INTO THE TUNNEL.

1270
01:16:18,211 --> 01:16:21,113
ONCE I GET IT THERE YOU
LOAD AND BLOW IT BEHIND HIM.

1271
01:16:23,850 --> 01:16:25,651
- CAS'?

1272
01:16:25,652 --> 01:16:27,487
CASSIDY, COME IN.

1273
01:16:27,488 --> 01:16:29,089
CASSIDY!

1274
01:16:29,090 --> 01:16:31,491
DAMN IT.

1275
01:16:40,869 --> 01:16:43,205
SOUNDS HUNGRY.

1276
01:16:43,207 --> 01:16:45,874
- YOU KNOW IF THAT THING
COMES THIS WAY TOO SOON

1277
01:16:45,875 --> 01:16:48,644
IT'S GONNA PUT CASSIDY RIGHT
BETWEEN IT AND THE GATOR.

1278
01:16:48,646 --> 01:16:49,679
- WELL, CASSIDY SAID
TO BLOW THE TUNNEL,

1279
01:16:49,680 --> 01:16:51,381
BUT SHE DIDN'T SAY
FROM WHAT SIDE.

1280
01:16:51,382 --> 01:16:53,283
I'M GOING THROUGH
TO THE OTHER END.

1281
01:16:53,284 --> 01:16:54,918
I SHOULD BE ABLE TO HELP HER
ONCE SHE GETS THE GATOR

1282
01:16:54,920 --> 01:16:56,154
TO THE VALLEY.

1283
01:16:56,155 --> 01:16:59,224
YOU WITH ME?

1284
01:16:59,225 --> 01:17:00,725
- THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

1285
01:17:00,726 --> 01:17:02,594
- RIGHT.

1286
01:17:19,214 --> 01:17:21,315
RIGHT THERE,
THERE'S THE FACTORY.

1287
01:17:23,186 --> 01:17:25,354
COME ON, LET'S GO.

1288
01:17:46,946 --> 01:17:49,715
- ALL RIGHT, IT'S IN, DO IT.

1289
01:18:15,913 --> 01:18:17,747
THERE IT IS.

1290
01:18:18,550 --> 01:18:20,651
HE DOESN'T SEE US.

1291
01:18:53,724 --> 01:18:56,325
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO.

1292
01:19:26,362 --> 01:19:27,162
- YOU OKAY?

1293
01:19:27,163 --> 01:19:29,931
- YEAH, I'M FINE.

1294
01:19:33,236 --> 01:19:35,338
LOOKS LIKE YOU
GOT YOUR WISH.

1295
01:19:57,231 --> 01:19:58,198
- FIGHT'S ALMOST OVER.

1296
01:19:58,199 --> 01:19:59,399
WE SHOULD
HIGHTAIL IT OUTTA HERE.

1297
01:19:59,400 --> 01:20:00,867
- NO WAY, NOT ON FOOT.

1298
01:20:00,868 --> 01:20:01,835
THIS IS FLAT GROUND.

1299
01:20:01,836 --> 01:20:02,703
THAT THING WILL
PICK UP OUR SCENT

1300
01:20:02,704 --> 01:20:04,070
AND BE ON US
IN A SECOND.

1301
01:20:04,072 --> 01:20:05,873
- YOU STILL HAVE THAT
EXTRA CHARGE YOU DIDN'T USE?

1302
01:20:05,874 --> 01:20:07,908
- YEAH, YEAH, BUT IT'S NOT
ENOUGH TO TAKE THAT DOWN.

1303
01:20:07,909 --> 01:20:08,876
- GIVE IT TO ME.

1304
01:20:08,877 --> 01:20:09,777
- WHY?

1305
01:20:09,779 --> 01:20:11,647
IT'S WORTHLESS.

1306
01:20:12,816 --> 01:20:14,282
- SEE ALL THAT?

1307
01:20:14,283 --> 01:20:16,552
THAT'S CONCENTRATED DUST AND
POWDER SUGAR HANGING IN THE AIR

1308
01:20:16,554 --> 01:20:18,555
WAITING FOR A TINY
SPARK WOULD IGNITE IT.

1309
01:20:18,556 --> 01:20:20,690
THIS IS THE SPARK
WE'RE GONNA NEED.

1310
01:20:20,691 --> 01:20:22,024
ALL RIGHT--
IT'S DO OR DIE TIME.

1311
01:20:22,026 --> 01:20:24,127
MAKE SURE YOU HIT THE DECK
WHEN I TOSS THIS THING IN.

1312
01:20:24,128 --> 01:20:25,663
- WHAT ABOUT YOU?

1313
01:20:25,664 --> 01:20:27,465
- SEE THAT TROUGH OUT THERE?

1314
01:20:27,466 --> 01:20:30,434
I'M HOPING THERE'S ENOUGH
RAIN WATER IN IT TO BE SAFE.

1315
01:20:30,436 --> 01:20:32,637
- WHAT IF THERE ISN'T?

1316
01:20:32,638 --> 01:20:35,774
- WELL, JUST MAKE SURE
THEY BURY ME IN THE SHIRT.

1317
01:21:07,613 --> 01:21:08,613
- YOU OKAY?

1318
01:21:08,614 --> 01:21:10,981
- YEAH.

1319
01:21:48,025 --> 01:21:50,928
- OH.

1320
01:21:50,930 --> 01:21:53,998
- YOU SURPRISED ME.

1321
01:21:57,838 --> 01:21:59,237
- OH.

1322
01:21:59,238 --> 01:22:00,806
GLAD THAT'S OVER WITH.

1323
01:22:36,304 --> 01:22:38,000
[reptilian screeching]
