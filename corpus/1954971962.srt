1
00:00:23,923 --> 00:00:25,834
That never sounded like an owl, Fred.

2
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,564
Kelly.

3
00:00:29,295 --> 00:00:33,368
We've got two hours to get back to base
before Oni starts spilling over time.

4
00:00:33,466 --> 00:00:36,413
Where's the chief? Where's Linda?

5
00:00:41,307 --> 00:00:43,344
Quick shore leave, chief.

6
00:00:45,512 --> 00:00:47,549
We're lucky command let us come at all.

7
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:50,285
This is it?

8
00:00:51,451 --> 00:00:55,729
Most of it's gone,
but yeah, it's the place.

9
00:00:58,124 --> 00:00:59,728
Then let's do this.

10
00:01:09,335 --> 00:01:10,973
<i>Ni'</i>

11
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:37,900
private journal entry.

12
00:01:37,997 --> 00:01:41,501
<i>Encrypt halsey 424-3.</i>

13
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:43,308
<i>Delete if tampered.</i>

14
00:01:45,972 --> 00:01:50,182
<i>A long time ago, I committed myself
to a path, a direction.</i>

15
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:54,383
<i>There were many branches in that path,
but ultimately they all flowered, I think.</i>

16
00:01:55,915 --> 00:01:59,226
<i>John was the first seed.</i>

17
00:02:00,386 --> 00:02:03,196
<i>I couldn't personally screen
every candidate.</i>

18
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:06,964
<i>The outer colonies were simply
too scattered, too distant.</i>

19
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:09,904
<i>But I had to set an example
for the other extraction teams.</i>

20
00:02:10,897 --> 00:02:13,377
<i>So the first candidate...</i>

21
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:16,447
<i>The first candidate,
I dealt with personally.</i>

22
00:02:17,904 --> 00:02:22,046
<i>But the outer colonies were still
very dangerous places in those days,</i>

23
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:24,588
<i>albeit for radically different reasons.</i>

24
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:29,589
<i>And so the office of naval intelligence
assigned me a chaperone,</i>

25
00:02:29,682 --> 00:02:31,855
<i>perhaps for my safety,</i>

26
00:02:31,951 --> 00:02:34,397
<i>perhaps for theirs.</i>

27
00:02:40,226 --> 00:02:42,206
Time to wake up, lieutenant Keyes.

28
00:02:43,763 --> 00:02:46,801
<i>We are preparing to exit slipspace
near the eridanus system.</i>

29
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,002
Dr. halsey?

30
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:51,309
<i>Already awake and
on the bridge, sir.</i>

31
00:02:51,404 --> 00:02:53,941
Eh, of course she is.

32
00:03:05,818 --> 00:03:07,161
Dr. halsey.

33
00:03:07,253 --> 00:03:10,826
Are these shuttles
all so damned claustrophobic?

34
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:14,770
There is barely room for one person
in here, let alone two.

35
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:16,272
- Doctor...
- Toran...

36
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:18,399
<i>Awaiting your orders, Dr. halsey.</i>

37
00:03:18,498 --> 00:03:22,207
Start a pre-burn warm-up cycle
for the fusion engines.

38
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:25,474
<i>Understood, doctor.
Exiting slipspace in six seconds.</i>

39
00:03:25,638 --> 00:03:27,174
Good. And some music.

40
00:03:27,273 --> 00:03:30,186
Rachmaninoff's concerto no. <i>3,</i> I think.

41
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:38,124
Now, lieutenant, you needed my attention?

42
00:03:38,518 --> 00:03:40,520
I was going to say I should act as pilot.

43
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:44,966
If I wished to be chauffeured, you would
already be in this chair, lieutenant.

44
00:03:45,825 --> 00:03:48,499
If you wish to make yourself useful,
take the comms

45
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:51,201
and make sure our arrival is discreet.

46
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:55,947
What are we doing here?
This area is dangerous.

47
00:03:56,035 --> 00:03:58,345
It's been an insurrectionist
stronghold for years.

48
00:03:58,438 --> 00:03:59,416
Meaning?

49
00:03:59,505 --> 00:04:03,920
Meaning the insurrection isn't some
ragtag group of colonial rowdies.

50
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:07,423
Toran, list rebel acts of violence
in this sector in last five days.

51
00:04:08,848 --> 00:04:10,293
<i>Seventy-two hours ago,</i>

52
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:13,193
<i>insurrectionists destroy emergency
food caravan.</i>

53
00:04:13,886 --> 00:04:18,130
<i>Eighteen hours ago, rebellion raids
merchant vessel, murders entire...</i>

54
00:04:18,324 --> 00:04:21,430
I am painfully aware
of the rebellion, lieutenant.

55
00:04:21,527 --> 00:04:24,508
Something needs to be done.
Oni agrees with me.

56
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:26,939
That is why we are here.

57
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:28,034
Om?

58
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:31,343
But if the office of naval intelligence...

59
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:32,939
This is a recon mission?

60
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:35,483
How terribly perceptive of you.

61
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:39,979
But what could you possibly need
to recon out here?

62
00:04:56,663 --> 00:04:58,336
I'm dressed like a fool.

63
00:04:58,431 --> 00:04:59,774
You're dressed like a father

64
00:04:59,866 --> 00:05:02,608
trying to get his daughter
into a decent school.

65
00:05:02,702 --> 00:05:04,409
I don't have a daughter.

66
00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:07,508
And I don't have a pony. Pay attention.

67
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,581
We are here to observe a boy,

68
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:12,656
the first of many evaluations
in the weeks to come.

69
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:16,693
I'm supposed to be protecting
shipping lanes, not babysitting.

70
00:05:16,783 --> 00:05:19,263
This child could be more useful
to the unsc

71
00:05:19,352 --> 00:05:22,925
than a fleet of destroyers,
a thousand lieutenants

72
00:05:23,022 --> 00:05:24,729
of even me.

73
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:27,771
In the end,
one child could be the difference

74
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:30,534
between peace and an unwinnable war.

75
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:33,043
Ah.

76
00:05:33,566 --> 00:05:35,637
There's our young man.

77
00:05:38,404 --> 00:05:41,214
<i>Journal entry.
Same encryption scheme.</i>

78
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:42,576
Who's next?

79
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:45,815
<i>John was the first,
and he was the best.</i>

80
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:50,722
Come on, he can't stop us all!

81
00:05:51,217 --> 00:05:54,255
<i>Even as a child,
I could see how special he was.</i>

82
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:56,958
<i>Sense his unformed potential.</i>

83
00:05:57,924 --> 00:06:01,565
<i>I simply needed to carve away
everything else to get to it.</i>

84
00:06:01,661 --> 00:06:03,334
<i>To shape it.</i>

85
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:07,601
<i>Form him into everything
I knew he would eventually become.</i>

86
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:12,606
Him?

87
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:14,741
- He can't be more than...
- Six.

88
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:18,288
John, like all of our candidates,
is six years old.

89
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:21,291
And like the others,
he has all the genetic markers.

90
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:24,991
There's something else
that makes him of interest.

91
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:28,024
Of interest to whom, precisely?

92
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:30,624
Here, record our interaction.

93
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:31,895
I'll talk to him,

94
00:06:31,991 --> 00:06:35,632
find out if his character
is as exceptional as his DNA.

95
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:46,480
Hello, what's your name?

96
00:06:46,973 --> 00:06:48,145
It's John.

97
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:50,619
And what game were you playing, John?

98
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:52,621
- War?
- King of the hill.

99
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:55,056
Mom says I'm too rough
with the other kids.

100
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:57,719
You like games? So do I.

101
00:06:58,818 --> 00:07:01,822
I have another game if you're interested.

102
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:04,025
This is a coin.

103
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:07,067
Win the game and you keep the coin.

104
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,039
You see the two sides?

105
00:07:09,128 --> 00:07:11,472
Yes. A man and a bird.

106
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:13,644
Which side will land up?

107
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:23,111
Bird.

108
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:25,416
Very good. Again.

109
00:07:26,045 --> 00:07:27,149
Man.

110
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:28,921
- Again.
- Man.

111
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:31,253
Bird.

112
00:07:31,818 --> 00:07:32,922
Bird.

113
00:07:33,152 --> 00:07:37,623
Five out of five, John. That's unusual.

114
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:39,633
You said I could keep it if I won.

115
00:07:39,725 --> 00:07:42,331
Yes. You can keep it, John.

116
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:44,130
Yes!

117
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:46,301
<i>I cursed myself
for using his name.</i>

118
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:49,744
<i>I couldn't afford the luxury of fondness.</i>

119
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:55,309
<i>No telling if subject 117
would even survive what lay ahead.</i>

120
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:58,284
Tell me you recorded that.

121
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:07,796
<i>It all fell into place
so quickly after John.</i>

122
00:08:07,887 --> 00:08:11,027
<i>It wasn't long
before I had my final candidates.</i>

123
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:21,577
These are the 75, déja.

124
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:27,478
<i>Confidential journal entry.</i>

125
00:08:27,573 --> 00:08:30,076
<i>Red encryption using my private key.</i>

126
00:08:32,612 --> 00:08:35,923
<i>As I said before,
I don't regret any of this.</i>

127
00:08:36,749 --> 00:08:38,660
<i>I've thought it all the way through.</i>

128
00:08:38,751 --> 00:08:41,231
<i>I am certain it will be worthwhile.</i>

129
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:46,665
<i>Right at that moment,
across several star systems,</i>

130
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:49,740
<i>children were being acquired
and shipped,</i>

131
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:51,968
<i>like freight to the planet reach.</i>

132
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:56,881
<i>We were replacing the children
with flash clones.</i>

133
00:08:56,969 --> 00:09:00,917
<i>Imperfect simulacra
but nigh impossible to detect.</i>

134
00:09:02,341 --> 00:09:05,220
<i>If I could have used the clones,
of course I would have,</i>

135
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:08,417
<i>but the damn things broke down
faster than we could grow them.</i>

136
00:09:08,514 --> 00:09:10,824
<i>We needed real children.</i>

137
00:09:10,983 --> 00:09:12,519
<i>Whole children.</i>

138
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,200
<i>It was a regrettable
but necessary deception.</i>

139
00:09:19,825 --> 00:09:21,771
<i>I needed those subjects.</i>

140
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:26,907
<i>Orion-h would not have succeeded
built on a foundation of compromise.</i>

141
00:09:32,438 --> 00:09:34,850
<i>On! Would have its soldiers,</i>

142
00:09:35,808 --> 00:09:38,448
<i>and I would have my solution.</i>

143
00:09:40,446 --> 00:09:42,619
May god have mercy on us all.

144
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:48,522
Doctor, they are here. They are ready.

145
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:49,998
Send them in.

146
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:53,468
And, déja, on second thought,
don't save this file.

147
00:09:56,862 --> 00:09:59,069
What happened?
How did I get here?

148
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:00,735
I don't know.

149
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:04,107
Take a seat. All of you.

150
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:10,110
Per naval code 45812,

151
00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:13,884
you are hereby conscripted
into unsc's special project

152
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,119
code-named Orion-ll,

153
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:18,995
also known as spartan ll.

154
00:10:19,585 --> 00:10:21,258
Your parents are gone.

155
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:23,994
The planet reach is your new home.

156
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:27,003
Your fellow trainees are your new family.

157
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:30,596
Each of you has been hand-selected
and called to serve.

158
00:10:30,696 --> 00:10:35,304
Your bodies are already faster
and stronger than other children,

159
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:38,211
and we are going to make them even better.

160
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:42,143
Chief petty officer Mendez,

161
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:46,917
escort the children to the mess hall,
feed them, get them to bed.

162
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,418
Trainees, fall out!

163
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:01,831
John.

164
00:11:03,462 --> 00:11:05,499
<i>Johnny, you need to wake up.</i>

165
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:07,877
Mom?

166
00:11:07,967 --> 00:11:09,207
Wake up!

167
00:11:09,301 --> 00:11:10,871
Wake up, trainee!

168
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:14,283
I said up! Do you know which way up is?

169
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:18,052
Last one up gets it, Jorge!

170
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:19,384
My name's pronounced "George."

171
00:11:19,545 --> 00:11:21,786
Don't you back talk me, Jorge!

172
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:26,725
- What's happening?
- I don't know. Just go, go!

173
00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:28,821
Come on. Everyone's headed this way.

174
00:11:28,921 --> 00:11:31,629
- I'm Sam, by the way.
- I'm Kelly.

175
00:11:31,724 --> 00:11:33,135
It'll be okay, Kelly.

176
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:45,472
Trainees, I am chief Mendez.

177
00:11:45,571 --> 00:11:47,915
Lam your commanding officer.

178
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:53,547
Every day, dawn till dusk,
you will do exactly what I say,

179
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:56,422
when I say, how I say.

180
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:59,988
- Am I clear, trainees?
- Sir, yes, sir.

181
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:03,631
<i>Naturally,
they didn't all make it.</i>

182
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:05,566
We expected drop-outs.

183
00:12:06,192 --> 00:12:09,833
<i>There were accidents, incidents, bad luck.</i>

184
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:14,443
<i>Better that we separated
the chaff from the wheat immediately.</i>

185
00:12:19,338 --> 00:12:22,217
Come in. Class is about to begin.

186
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:26,481
<i>We trained their minds
as well as their bodies.</i>

187
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:31,926
<i>War strategy, theoretical tactics,
sun tzu,</i>

188
00:12:32,017 --> 00:12:35,328
<i>nothing in the sprawling history
of conflict was overlooked.</i>

189
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:40,327
<i>We taught them about thermopylae,
about the unbeatable spartans.</i>

190
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:44,272
Xerxes wanted to steal Greece
from the spartans.

191
00:12:44,396 --> 00:12:47,309
<i>His forces numbered in the thousands.</i>

192
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,102
Why didn't xerxes just sail around them?

193
00:12:50,202 --> 00:12:53,240
Xerxes wanted to send
a message, John.

194
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:56,980
He failed
and just 300 spartans saved Greece.

195
00:12:57,243 --> 00:12:58,381
Yes!

196
00:12:58,477 --> 00:12:59,785
That is all for today.

197
00:13:00,212 --> 00:13:03,091
But tomorrow I will tell you about wolves.

198
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,324
Today's mission is ring the bell.

199
00:13:11,423 --> 00:13:16,463
When every member of your team
has rung the bell, cross this line.

200
00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:18,467
Question, trainee?

201
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:21,636
- What do we win, sir?
- You win dinner, 117.

202
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:25,910
- Last team to finish goes without dinner.
- Oh, no!

203
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:29,646
Make ready. Go!

204
00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:37,654
<i>I knew John was a natural
leader, even if he didn't.</i>

205
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:39,921
John, a little help?

206
00:13:57,036 --> 00:13:58,276
First.

207
00:14:00,372 --> 00:14:05,287
<i>A leader must inspire passion,
and 117 certainly did that.</i>

208
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:07,551
Hey, thanks for nothing.

209
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:12,757
Good work, trainees.

210
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,957
Everybody eats,

211
00:14:15,087 --> 00:14:16,964
except 117 and his team.

212
00:14:17,056 --> 00:14:18,330
But I was first.

213
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:21,462
You were first,
but your team came in last.

214
00:14:22,294 --> 00:14:25,332
And you don't win unless your team wins.

215
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,554
Get out of here.

216
00:14:42,648 --> 00:14:45,925
- Kelly!
- No. Kelly's right, Sam.

217
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:50,124
He could've helped us today,
instead he left us in the dirt.

218
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:52,963
I'm sorry, guys-

219
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:54,765
I stole them a few nights ago.

220
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:57,534
They're stale but better than nothing.

221
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:04,047
- It's not Turkey.
- I know.

222
00:15:04,136 --> 00:15:07,276
It won't happen again. Promise.

223
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:10,119
<i>And that was it.</i>

224
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:14,315
<i>Logic, consequences, spark of leadership.</i>

225
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:17,087
<i>Ah things I saw in him from the start.</i>

226
00:15:29,528 --> 00:15:33,169
You are each being handed
a portion of a map of the area below.

227
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,439
The mission is simple.

228
00:15:35,534 --> 00:15:37,377
You will be individually deployed

229
00:15:37,469 --> 00:15:42,111
and use your piece of the puzzle
to navigate to the extraction point.

230
00:15:42,207 --> 00:15:45,745
Last trainee to make it to extraction
will be left behind.

231
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:50,158
And it is a very long walk back.

232
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:53,858
- 117, you're first.
- Yes, sir.

233
00:15:57,589 --> 00:16:00,365
- Sam, the river.
- I got it.

234
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:02,439
Pass the word, quietly.

235
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:04,166
117, front and center.

236
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:14,075
Good luck, 117.

237
00:16:55,447 --> 00:16:57,620
You sound nothing like an owl, Sam.

238
00:16:57,816 --> 00:17:01,662
- Ah, I've been practicing.
- It sounded exactly like an owl.

239
00:17:01,754 --> 00:17:03,791
I was just drawing you out of cover.

240
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:12,734
Look what I found.

241
00:17:13,465 --> 00:17:15,570
Blueberries? Nice!

242
00:17:16,301 --> 00:17:18,008
I hope these are blueberries.

243
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:20,081
Better than the food in the mess.

244
00:17:21,306 --> 00:17:23,047
Your lips are blue.

245
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:24,621
So are yours.

246
00:17:25,511 --> 00:17:27,286
<i>In the end,
the wilderness mission</i>

247
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:30,155
<i>wasn't a test of strength or survival</i>

248
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:33,719
<i>but of friendship, camaraderie, loyalty.</i>

249
00:17:34,753 --> 00:17:36,289
What are you doing?

250
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:39,096
I'm putting our mark on this place,
so we can remember it.

251
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:41,362
Now and forever.

252
00:17:42,027 --> 00:17:44,564
- We should meet up with the others.
- Then what?

253
00:17:44,696 --> 00:17:46,903
Someone is still gonna get left behind.

254
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:49,536
Then I find a way to get everyone home.

255
00:17:55,407 --> 00:18:00,447
One of those map fragments was bogus.
But I'm sure this is the extraction point.

256
00:18:00,946 --> 00:18:03,051
Almost a day's hike from here.

257
00:18:03,215 --> 00:18:05,092
Then we better get moving.

258
00:18:14,726 --> 00:18:15,704
Hold.

259
00:18:15,794 --> 00:18:17,501
You guys with me. Fall out.

260
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:18,973
And keep quiet.

261
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,509
I heard something.

262
00:18:24,303 --> 00:18:26,647
<i>And what I find fascinating
is that</i>

263
00:18:26,738 --> 00:18:30,242
<i>even though you think
you've prepared for every eventuality...</i>

264
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:32,715
They're armed but they aren't in uniform.

265
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:35,951
And they don't look like soldiers.
Insurrectionists, maybe?

266
00:18:36,048 --> 00:18:37,584
<i>Every contingency...</i>

267
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:39,352
So what now?

268
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:41,362
<i>Every permutation...</i>

269
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:42,488
Wolves.

270
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:46,161
When déja taught us about the wolves,
how they hunt...

271
00:18:46,258 --> 00:18:47,601
What does that...

272
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:49,499
The wolves.

273
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:52,667
<i>Children still manage
to surprise you.</i>

274
00:18:55,267 --> 00:18:58,248
<i>Wolves, children,
are fierce hunters.</i>

275
00:18:58,337 --> 00:19:01,648
<i>But while any wolf
can hunt and kill a rabbit,</i>

276
00:19:04,543 --> 00:19:06,819
<i>one wolf against larger prey</i>

277
00:19:08,547 --> 00:19:10,424
<i>can</i> face a <i>grisly end.</i>

278
00:19:14,353 --> 00:19:18,130
- What the...
- I need help! My friend is hurt!

279
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:21,827
- Go bring that girl back.
- Yes, sir.

280
00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:24,066
<i>But when wolves hunt in a pack...</i>

281
00:19:25,564 --> 00:19:28,306
- Where's the girl?
- I think I broke my leg.

282
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,880
Oh, I got your broken leg right here, kid.

283
00:19:30,969 --> 00:19:33,677
<i>They take down larger prey
with ease.</i>

284
00:19:41,613 --> 00:19:43,024
What the hell, Vince?

285
00:19:43,148 --> 00:19:45,150
One little girl
too much for you to handle?

286
00:20:08,407 --> 00:20:10,148
Ah, doctor.

287
00:20:10,275 --> 00:20:15,418
Trainee 117 was just explaining
why he attacked and injured unsc soldiers.

288
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:19,894
And why he stole the property
they were left to guard.

289
00:20:20,586 --> 00:20:22,930
Ma'am, the craft was unsc,

290
00:20:23,021 --> 00:20:27,094
but the men in the force were hostile
and were not in regulation uniform.

291
00:20:27,593 --> 00:20:30,403
- You flew home?
- Not exactly.

292
00:20:30,495 --> 00:20:33,237
I rigged the autopilot
to return to base, ma'am.

293
00:20:33,665 --> 00:20:35,576
And you brought them all home?

294
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:39,171
According to orders, last trainee
to the ship was supposed to walk.

295
00:20:39,304 --> 00:20:43,116
Instead, we stuck together,
like the spartans at thermopylae.

296
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:46,417
In the real ending of the story, 117,

297
00:20:46,511 --> 00:20:48,787
the spartans are betrayed and slaughtered.

298
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,987
It is their sacrifice
that actually saves and unites Greece.

299
00:20:54,353 --> 00:20:56,094
But we had more choices.

300
00:20:56,221 --> 00:20:58,223
The men you hit with rocks didn't.

301
00:20:58,323 --> 00:21:00,496
No, sir, they did not.

302
00:21:02,527 --> 00:21:06,737
So, doctor, what do we do with this one?

303
00:21:06,832 --> 00:21:11,679
Well, Mendez,
I suggest a promotion to squad leader.

304
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:15,279
Thank you, sir.

305
00:21:15,374 --> 00:21:17,445
What is the highest rank I can attain?

306
00:21:17,542 --> 00:21:20,113
As a non-commissioned officer, 117,

307
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:24,558
the highest rank you can attain
is master chief petty officer.

308
00:21:24,683 --> 00:21:25,957
Then I will.

309
00:21:26,051 --> 00:21:27,621
Perhaps you will at that,

310
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:31,028
but your next mission won't be so easy.

311
00:21:32,057 --> 00:21:34,503
And there will be casualties.

312
00:21:35,994 --> 00:21:37,996
What is that mission, sir?

313
00:21:40,232 --> 00:21:42,007
<i>Your mission, John,</i>

314
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:45,377
<i>is to survive.</i>

315
00:22:05,624 --> 00:22:08,798
<i>Samuel-034,
blue team mission report.</i>

316
00:22:09,261 --> 00:22:10,797
<i>I don't remember the operation,</i>

317
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:17,178
<i>but when we awoke, we were something new.</i>

318
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:22,747
<i>Unbreakable materials
grafted to our bones, gene therapy.</i>

319
00:22:29,381 --> 00:22:33,796
<i>Muscle density increased,
enhanced skeletal and muscular growth.</i>

320
00:22:35,554 --> 00:22:36,532
<i>Of course,</i>

321
00:22:37,756 --> 00:22:40,930
<i>we had no clue
what we had to live through first.</i>

322
00:22:46,164 --> 00:22:47,871
Replay the message, déja.

323
00:22:48,934 --> 00:22:51,915
Message from admiral Ysionris Jeromi.

324
00:22:52,003 --> 00:22:55,143
Chief medical officer,
research station hopeful.

325
00:22:58,143 --> 00:23:00,419
<i>Catherine,
I wish I had better news.</i>

326
00:23:01,179 --> 00:23:04,353
<i>Further analysis
has yielded zero alternatives</i>

327
00:23:04,449 --> 00:23:08,898
<i>to mitigate the risks in your proposed
hypothetical experimentation.</i>

328
00:23:09,788 --> 00:23:13,531
<i>But I understand
the theoretical framework, Catherine,</i>

329
00:23:13,658 --> 00:23:15,399
<i>and admire the imagination.</i>

330
00:23:15,994 --> 00:23:19,806
<i>But! Hope it is
in fact a hypothetical study.</i>

331
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:23,511
<i>Details are in the attached files.</i>

332
00:23:23,602 --> 00:23:27,049
<i>But your proposed treatments
could result In any of the following,</i>

333
00:23:27,139 --> 00:23:30,882
<i>cell necrosis, stroke,
cardiovascular failure</i>

334
00:23:30,976 --> 00:23:33,286
<i>and even Fletcher syndrome.</i>

335
00:23:40,819 --> 00:23:45,199
<i>You proposed the use of lab animals,
simian proxies, in your tests.</i>

336
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:47,292
<i>I must be blunt.</i>

337
00:23:47,392 --> 00:23:51,898
<i>I cannot imagine any more than half
of the subjects surviving this process.</i>

338
00:24:13,585 --> 00:24:16,122
<i>I would hate to see
the poor creatures destroyed</i>

339
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:19,428
<i>in some section h! Project, Dr. halsey.</i>

340
00:24:20,892 --> 00:24:23,702
<i>Well, I've said my piece.</i>

341
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:26,071
<i>Best of luck to you, Catherine.</i>

342
00:24:26,932 --> 00:24:33,076
Doctor, augmentation was always
a vital but statistically dangerous stage.

343
00:24:34,673 --> 00:24:36,118
How many?

344
00:24:36,274 --> 00:24:38,276
Oni was promised soldiers,

345
00:24:38,376 --> 00:24:41,220
and you were the only mind
that could accomplish it.

346
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:43,190
How many dead, déja?

347
00:24:43,882 --> 00:24:45,793
Twenty-seven deceased.

348
00:24:45,884 --> 00:24:47,955
36% of the candidates.

349
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:50,994
Children.

350
00:24:51,089 --> 00:24:54,298
36% of the children.

351
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:59,374
The subjects are just
one-half of the equation, doctor.

352
00:24:59,464 --> 00:25:03,435
Both Mjolnir and the cognitive impression
modeling are critical.

353
00:25:05,637 --> 00:25:06,672
You're correct.

354
00:25:06,771 --> 00:25:10,184
- Doctor?
- This is our only option.

355
00:25:11,543 --> 00:25:14,683
Every day the insurrection invents
new acts of terror

356
00:25:14,779 --> 00:25:17,487
to pull humanity farther into the muck.

357
00:25:17,582 --> 00:25:20,563
Our civilization is balanced
on a razor's edge,

358
00:25:20,652 --> 00:25:24,498
and the insurgents threaten
to bring it down around our ears.

359
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:29,768
If even one candidate survives
and balance is restored,

360
00:25:29,895 --> 00:25:32,603
history will absolve me
for the greater good.

361
00:25:40,138 --> 00:25:41,208
Duty.

362
00:25:41,973 --> 00:25:42,951
Honor.

363
00:25:44,175 --> 00:25:45,677
Self-sacrifice.

364
00:25:47,178 --> 00:25:52,457
<i>We were 14 when we lost almost half
of our comrades to augmentation failures.</i>

365
00:25:52,918 --> 00:25:56,525
Death does not diminish
these qualities in a soldier.

366
00:25:58,456 --> 00:26:00,834
We shall remember our dead.

367
00:26:01,993 --> 00:26:04,803
Honors, attention!

368
00:26:06,932 --> 00:26:10,778
<i>Kids I grew up with,
never said goodbye to.</i>

369
00:26:12,837 --> 00:26:16,284
We commit the bodies of our fallen
to space.

370
00:26:26,384 --> 00:26:28,557
<i>I stiff remember their names.</i>

371
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:42,074
<i>The deaths affected
each of us differently.</i>

372
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:46,410
<i>Fire teams came and went,
but core loyalties and friendships endure.</i>

373
00:26:47,639 --> 00:26:49,277
<i>Even beyond death.</i>

374
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:53,250
<i>Of course, it didn't sit well with John.</i>

375
00:26:54,379 --> 00:26:56,154
Where are you taking my men?

376
00:26:56,247 --> 00:26:57,954
Let 'em go, squad leader.

377
00:26:59,184 --> 00:27:00,925
They can't fight anymore.

378
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:02,828
They don't belong here.

379
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:03,955
What happens to them?

380
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:07,096
The Navy takes care of its own.

381
00:27:07,225 --> 00:27:08,898
Their minds are still sharp.

382
00:27:08,994 --> 00:27:14,137
And our war effort can always use soldiers
for less physical duties.

383
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:17,170
<i>John never left anyone behind.</i>

384
00:27:17,268 --> 00:27:18,906
<i>Not if he could help it.</i>

385
00:27:19,004 --> 00:27:20,847
Was there something else, son?

386
00:27:20,939 --> 00:27:25,149
Sir, I'm squad leader.
Members of my unit died.

387
00:27:25,243 --> 00:27:27,283
What should I have done
to keep that from happening?

388
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:29,285
117.

389
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:31,491
John.

390
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:34,287
What your class went through,

391
00:27:35,286 --> 00:27:39,166
that any of you survived at all
is a testament to your strength.

392
00:27:40,058 --> 00:27:41,560
Walk with me.

393
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:48,770
A leader must be ready to send the men
under his command to their deaths.

394
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:51,541
Your duty is to the mission.

395
00:27:51,636 --> 00:27:55,982
I'm sorry, sir, but I fail to see
how that applies to this situation.

396
00:27:56,074 --> 00:27:58,020
The lesson is sacrifice.

397
00:27:58,977 --> 00:28:02,789
It is acceptable to spend lives
when necessary, squad leader.

398
00:28:03,882 --> 00:28:07,295
What is not acceptable
is to waste said lives.

399
00:28:09,988 --> 00:28:13,663
Which was this, sir? Spent or wasted?

400
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:16,766
Get some rest, squad leader.

401
00:28:26,571 --> 00:28:29,313
- What did Mendez say?
- Not much.

402
00:28:30,341 --> 00:28:31,479
Let me guess.

403
00:28:31,609 --> 00:28:33,850
Something about duty and sucking it up.

404
00:28:33,945 --> 00:28:35,686
That sounds nothing like him.

405
00:28:36,648 --> 00:28:38,525
Like your owl.

406
00:28:38,616 --> 00:28:40,687
It sounds exactly like him.

407
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:45,797
Me and kels are going
to the shooting range later. You in?

408
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:48,234
No. I'm going to hit the gym.

409
00:28:56,768 --> 00:28:59,749
<i>John was still
processing our losses.</i>

410
00:29:00,872 --> 00:29:03,318
<i>Emotionally and physically.</i>

411
00:29:06,511 --> 00:29:10,982
<i>For weeks after augmentation,
every bone in our bodies ached.</i>

412
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:17,157
<i>Our eyes throbbed and bled.</i>

413
00:29:17,989 --> 00:29:19,434
<i>We got headaches.</i>

414
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:21,062
<i>Fell down.</i>

415
00:29:22,393 --> 00:29:24,339
<i>Clumsy in our new skins.</i>

416
00:29:25,196 --> 00:29:27,904
<i>Dr. halsey told us our brains
would have to relearn</i>

417
00:29:27,999 --> 00:29:29,979
<i>how to work with our new bodies.</i>

418
00:29:30,068 --> 00:29:32,412
<i>Learn how to use new strength and speed.</i>

419
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:38,216
<i>But it wasn't easy.</i>

420
00:29:38,843 --> 00:29:39,913
<i>And it was frustrating.</i>

421
00:29:47,418 --> 00:29:48,863
<i>The thing about John is that</i>

422
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:51,797
<i>he really only knew three ways
to react to people.</i>

423
00:29:56,027 --> 00:29:58,633
<i>If you were his superior officer,
he obeyed you.</i>

424
00:29:59,164 --> 00:30:02,407
<i>If you were in his squad,
he would die for you.</i>

425
00:30:02,901 --> 00:30:04,175
<i>But if you were a threat?</i>

426
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:07,408
<i>Then god help you.</i>

427
00:30:28,259 --> 00:30:30,432
Heart rate steady. Pulse level.

428
00:30:30,528 --> 00:30:31,939
He's barely breaking a sweat.

429
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:33,575
What is he doing?

430
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:36,168
What we built him to do. He's winning.

431
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:38,481
I'm gonna stop this now.

432
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:41,643
How is his adrenaline level, I wonder.

433
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:56,327
Attention!

434
00:30:58,389 --> 00:30:59,390
At ease.

435
00:31:00,258 --> 00:31:02,169
Your workout is over for today.

436
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:04,867
Sir, those men.

437
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:07,500
Was this a test?

438
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:11,810
You engaged and neutralized a threat,
squad leader.

439
00:31:12,937 --> 00:31:13,938
They started it.

440
00:31:14,939 --> 00:31:16,475
I was defending myself.

441
00:31:17,642 --> 00:31:19,815
But still they were fellow soldiers.

442
00:31:20,845 --> 00:31:22,449
People die.

443
00:31:22,747 --> 00:31:26,160
Sacrifice is a necessary consequence
of war.

444
00:31:26,284 --> 00:31:29,026
But, sir, they were wasted, not spent.

445
00:31:29,654 --> 00:31:30,860
Because of me.

446
00:31:30,955 --> 00:31:33,299
Your priorities are to follow orders,

447
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:35,837
and to preserve your life
and the lives of your team.

448
00:31:35,927 --> 00:31:38,032
Is that clear, squad leader?

449
00:31:39,497 --> 00:31:40,737
Yes, sir.

450
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:47,645
<i>We heard what happened.</i>

451
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:49,776
<i>Everyone on the ship did.</i>

452
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:51,945
<i>It was an accident.</i>

453
00:31:52,043 --> 00:31:54,284
<i>That didn't make it any easier for John.</i>

454
00:32:01,585 --> 00:32:03,496
Apologies, doctor,

455
00:32:03,587 --> 00:32:07,763
but I have been attempting to decode
a transmission from the planet harvest.

456
00:32:07,858 --> 00:32:11,032
- And?
- It's fragmented and incomplete.

457
00:32:11,128 --> 00:32:13,005
And it stopped repeating.

458
00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:14,541
Show me what you have.

459
00:32:24,541 --> 00:32:25,747
Gods.

460
00:32:25,843 --> 00:32:27,720
Déja, give me a feed from harvest.

461
00:32:27,811 --> 00:32:30,257
- Scanning spectrum.
- Anything.

462
00:32:30,347 --> 00:32:34,454
A comm station, a news feed,
a grain elevator, damn it.

463
00:32:34,618 --> 00:32:36,063
Not found.

464
00:32:36,153 --> 00:32:40,659
It may be interference or a problem
with the slipspace beacon relays.

465
00:32:41,391 --> 00:32:43,837
Harvest is on a 12-hour signal delay.

466
00:32:43,961 --> 00:32:46,202
Get Mendez,
but keep scanning harvest.

467
00:32:49,032 --> 00:32:53,105
I'm accelerating the schedule.
I want a test in a combat mission.

468
00:32:53,203 --> 00:32:56,184
<i>Ma'am,</i> that's needlessly
aggressive.

469
00:32:56,273 --> 00:32:57,308
I disagree.

470
00:32:57,407 --> 00:33:00,547
Brass wants spartans deployed,
and so do I.

471
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:13,361
There's a mission Oni has been saving
for the right team.

472
00:33:13,457 --> 00:33:16,802
Colonel Robert watts
earned his rank in the unsc,

473
00:33:16,927 --> 00:33:19,601
but in 2512 he went turncoat.

474
00:33:19,763 --> 00:33:24,234
And now leads the Insurrectionist forces
in the eridanus system.

475
00:33:24,334 --> 00:33:28,339
Watts has spent 12 years leading raids
against unsc targets,

476
00:33:28,438 --> 00:33:31,578
killing civilians and military alike.

477
00:33:31,675 --> 00:33:33,655
We have intel that watts
is planning to attack

478
00:33:33,744 --> 00:33:36,520
medical satellites in the outer colonies.

479
00:33:37,347 --> 00:33:41,557
Recently, one of watts' men
cut a deal with Oni.

480
00:33:41,652 --> 00:33:44,098
We have known for some time
that watts' forces

481
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:47,135
were launching
from the eridanus asteroid belt.

482
00:33:47,224 --> 00:33:51,468
But there are millions of rocks
scattered over billions of kilometers.

483
00:33:52,429 --> 00:33:54,932
Our informant did not know
the exact location.

484
00:33:55,065 --> 00:33:58,774
However, he did know that
the freighter <i>laden</i> is a supply vessel.

485
00:33:58,902 --> 00:34:00,074
Mendez.

486
00:34:00,170 --> 00:34:04,778
Laden is set to leave dock in six
hours for routine engine recertification.

487
00:34:05,576 --> 00:34:08,113
And yet, she's been loaded with
enough food and water

488
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:10,089
to supply a small city.

489
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:14,822
<i>Spartans, you will be dropped
at the eridanus h space docks.</i>

490
00:34:15,185 --> 00:34:18,428
You'll be dressed the same
<i>as</i> members of the laden crew.

491
00:34:18,722 --> 00:34:22,795
Once in the base, you will infiltrate
the installation and take watts alive.

492
00:34:22,926 --> 00:34:24,337
If you can.

493
00:34:25,028 --> 00:34:28,976
<i>They would've detected a unsc ship.
They wouldn't detect us.</i>

494
00:34:29,967 --> 00:34:31,674
Be prepared for anything.

495
00:34:32,536 --> 00:34:34,379
Finally, squad leader,

496
00:34:34,471 --> 00:34:37,918
you are hereby promoted
to petty officer third class.

497
00:34:47,384 --> 00:34:49,455
<i>Everything went off without a hitch.</i>

498
00:34:49,553 --> 00:34:52,591
<i>Before long, we were safe
in the micro gravity well.</i>

499
00:34:57,394 --> 00:35:00,466
I can never get shut-eye
before a mission.

500
00:35:01,598 --> 00:35:02,599
What are you doing?

501
00:35:02,699 --> 00:35:05,077
Scanning freight and shipping documents.

502
00:35:05,168 --> 00:35:08,308
Read it to me. That'll put me to sleep.

503
00:35:08,405 --> 00:35:11,545
Ten hours out, blue team.
We'll rotate sleep cycles.

504
00:35:12,342 --> 00:35:15,050
- Find anything, Kelly?
- Everything.

505
00:35:15,145 --> 00:35:19,059
Laden doesn't have a ship board al
and their security is a joke.

506
00:35:19,182 --> 00:35:20,183
Course setting.

507
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:24,096
We've got a loose trajectory
into the belt, but no final destination.

508
00:35:24,187 --> 00:35:27,066
Meaning insurgents
don't even trust their own people.

509
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:30,660
Keep digging, and wake me in four.
I'll take over watch.

510
00:35:37,768 --> 00:35:39,611
Where did everyone go?

511
00:35:41,772 --> 00:35:42,842
John?

512
00:35:46,276 --> 00:35:48,552
Where were you when we needed you?

513
00:35:54,785 --> 00:35:57,026
I'm up. What've you got?

514
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,656
I picked up where Kelly left off

515
00:35:58,789 --> 00:36:01,633
and I found something odd
in the ship's manifest.

516
00:36:01,725 --> 00:36:03,295
Hidden in the standard rations,

517
00:36:03,393 --> 00:36:07,034
there's a single crate of cigars,
steaks and chocolates.

518
00:36:07,130 --> 00:36:08,609
Luxury items.

519
00:36:08,699 --> 00:36:11,407
That crate is going to watts.

520
00:36:11,501 --> 00:36:13,412
Precisely what I was thinking.

521
00:36:22,379 --> 00:36:25,724
Follow me. Stay quiet. Blend in.

522
00:36:25,816 --> 00:36:27,693
Kelly, get a bearing on that crate.

523
00:36:28,485 --> 00:36:32,023
On the monorail, headed towards
the tallest building in town.

524
00:36:32,155 --> 00:36:34,465
Only the best for colonel watts.

525
00:36:39,529 --> 00:36:42,999
Nav marker at 443 meters and holding.

526
00:36:43,133 --> 00:36:45,579
Top floor, helmets on. Move out.

527
00:37:06,056 --> 00:37:07,831
Fresh batch, colonel.

528
00:37:30,113 --> 00:37:32,491
<i>It was going well. We felt good.</i>

529
00:37:33,216 --> 00:37:34,786
<i>We got cocky.</i>

530
00:37:34,885 --> 00:37:36,956
<i>Well, I did.</i>

531
00:37:41,558 --> 00:37:42,662
Sam, look out!

532
00:37:51,034 --> 00:37:52,138
John!

533
00:37:52,869 --> 00:37:54,780
John, can you hear me?

534
00:37:55,372 --> 00:37:56,407
It should've been me.

535
00:37:56,506 --> 00:37:58,110
Secure the area.

536
00:37:58,775 --> 00:38:02,154
The biofoam will keep your guts
where they belong till we get home.

537
00:38:02,245 --> 00:38:03,485
It's going to hurt.

538
00:38:04,347 --> 00:38:06,258
That was stupid, John.

539
00:38:06,383 --> 00:38:09,387
Queen doesn't sacrifice everything
to collect a pawn.

540
00:38:09,519 --> 00:38:12,966
All the pieces go back in the same
box when the game is done.

541
00:38:14,224 --> 00:38:16,830
- You hit?
- Nope. I'm lucky.

542
00:38:16,927 --> 00:38:18,327
Some idiot caught my bullet for me.

543
00:38:18,495 --> 00:38:20,941
Do not make me laugh right now.

544
00:38:40,617 --> 00:38:41,823
You won't take me alive.

545
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,661
My men will come for you.

546
00:38:45,755 --> 00:38:48,998
Empty the crate.
Sam, load the cargo.

547
00:38:49,392 --> 00:38:51,838
Cargo? Unhand me, boy.

548
00:38:51,928 --> 00:38:55,774
I don't know who or what you are,
but I know two things, son.

549
00:38:56,366 --> 00:38:58,676
One, none of you are gettin' out alive.

550
00:38:59,135 --> 00:39:03,277
And two, I am absolutely not
getting in that damned box.

551
00:39:18,788 --> 00:39:22,167
<i>We believed</i> we <i>had dealt
the insurrection a mortal blow.</i>

552
00:39:22,259 --> 00:39:23,966
<i>Maybe we did.</i>

553
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:26,097
<i>But everything was about to change.</i>

554
00:39:30,133 --> 00:39:31,544
Who's that?

555
00:39:31,635 --> 00:39:33,239
Uniform says Keyes.

556
00:39:33,837 --> 00:39:35,317
Maybe he's here to interrogate watts?

557
00:39:38,942 --> 00:39:41,081
Nice work, 117.

558
00:39:41,177 --> 00:39:43,316
- John, isn't it?
- Yes, sir.

559
00:39:44,147 --> 00:39:45,319
Have we met?

560
00:39:45,415 --> 00:39:48,225
A long time ago. You wouldn't remember.

561
00:39:48,318 --> 00:39:50,764
You were just a kid fighting in the dust.

562
00:39:50,854 --> 00:39:53,892
Now you're a warrior.
And just in the Nick of time.

563
00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:56,527
- Sir?
- You'll know soon enough.

564
00:39:57,294 --> 00:39:58,398
Dismissed.

565
00:40:00,096 --> 00:40:02,702
Amphitheater, spartans. On the double.

566
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:16,990
What do you think it is?
Insurrection revenge strike?

567
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:19,924
It's something else. Something big.

568
00:40:23,253 --> 00:40:24,698
At ease, spartans.

569
00:40:25,322 --> 00:40:27,268
Lam vice admiral Stanforth.

570
00:40:27,791 --> 00:40:31,238
This is harvest.
Population of three million.

571
00:40:31,328 --> 00:40:33,740
A peaceful and productive farming world.

572
00:40:33,830 --> 00:40:36,276
On February 3rd, at 1423 hours,

573
00:40:36,399 --> 00:40:40,779
the harvest orbital platform made
long range radar contact with this object.

574
00:40:41,504 --> 00:40:44,485
After that,
all contact with harvest was lost.

575
00:40:45,675 --> 00:40:47,916
<i>Command assembled a battle group.</i>

576
00:40:48,011 --> 00:40:51,515
<i>What they found
was all that was left of harvest.</i>

577
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:54,152
<i>Three million fives lost.</i>

578
00:40:54,284 --> 00:40:58,460
<i>The colony burnt to ash.
Power like humanity has never seen.</i>

579
00:40:58,555 --> 00:41:01,161
<i>Then they encountered this.</i>

580
00:41:03,126 --> 00:41:05,868
<i>A starship of unknown design.</i>

581
00:41:05,962 --> 00:41:08,033
<i>It destroyed the Vostok and the Arabia
in under a minute,</i>

582
00:41:08,131 --> 00:41:11,738
<i>using highly advanced weapons
and impenetrable shielding.</i>

583
00:41:11,835 --> 00:41:14,941
<i>The heracles escaped into slipspace
with substantial damage</i>

584
00:41:15,071 --> 00:41:16,744
<i>and brought this intel back.</i>

585
00:41:17,307 --> 00:41:20,618
They will not negotiate,
they will not communicate.

586
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:23,418
They cannot be reasoned or bartered with.

587
00:41:23,513 --> 00:41:25,891
<i>We had just fought
the insurrectionists,</i>

588
00:41:25,982 --> 00:41:27,928
<i>stopped a plot to murder millions.</i>

589
00:41:28,918 --> 00:41:33,833
<i>Only to realize that this could be
the very end of humankind. Period.</i>

590
00:41:35,525 --> 00:41:37,300
Humanity will fight back.

591
00:41:38,395 --> 00:41:42,810
We've already seen that we cannot do it
with the blunt instrument of a fleet.

592
00:41:42,932 --> 00:41:45,640
We need the surgical precision
of a scalpel.

593
00:41:46,903 --> 00:41:49,941
The spartan program is that scalpel.

594
00:41:51,408 --> 00:41:55,754
We received a message before the attack
in ueg base English.

595
00:41:55,912 --> 00:41:57,585
Play the message, beowulf.

596
00:42:01,117 --> 00:42:06,123
Humans, your destruction
is the will of the gods.

597
00:42:06,256 --> 00:42:09,533
And we are their instrument.

598
00:42:20,870 --> 00:42:24,784
<i>Kelly-087 of blue team.
Mission debrief.</i>

599
00:42:33,950 --> 00:42:37,693
<i>We were on the commonwealth,
en route to chi ceti iv.</i>

600
00:42:37,787 --> 00:42:41,633
<i>When we weren't in cryo,
we were all crammed into the bunk room,</i>

601
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:44,067
<i>there was always more prep, more planning.</i>

602
00:42:45,195 --> 00:42:46,640
Damn it!

603
00:42:47,297 --> 00:42:50,210
- You're still dropping your shoulder.
- I know.

604
00:42:54,504 --> 00:42:55,812
Let's go again.

605
00:42:58,608 --> 00:43:02,146
Does project Mjolnir
mean anything to anyone?

606
00:43:02,779 --> 00:43:04,759
Gotta be some kind of weapon.

607
00:43:04,848 --> 00:43:07,590
Brass isn't very imaginative
with codenames.

608
00:43:07,684 --> 00:43:09,823
<i>Spartan 117,
report to the bridge.</i>

609
00:43:09,919 --> 00:43:10,954
Yes, ma'am.

610
00:43:11,554 --> 00:43:14,296
Sam, get everyone ready. On the double.

611
00:43:14,724 --> 00:43:16,260
You heard the petty officer.

612
00:43:16,359 --> 00:43:18,930
Dog the distractions
and into uniforms, spartans.

613
00:43:28,071 --> 00:43:29,744
<i>As we scrambled to get ready,</i>

614
00:43:29,873 --> 00:43:34,151
<i>John was dragged into a pissing contest
between Dr. halsey and the captain.</i>

615
00:43:34,244 --> 00:43:35,917
Ma'am. Captain Wallace.

616
00:43:36,513 --> 00:43:37,583
There it is again.

617
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:40,524
Doctor, that puts our ghost
at 80 million clicks.

618
00:43:40,617 --> 00:43:43,621
Even if it were a ship,
and I don't concur that it is,

619
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:46,326
it would take an hour
to get within weapons range.

620
00:43:46,422 --> 00:43:49,198
Besides, it's disappeared again.

621
00:43:49,292 --> 00:43:52,739
Captain, it is my recommendation
that we go to battle stations.

622
00:43:52,829 --> 00:43:54,502
We have plenty of time.

623
00:43:54,597 --> 00:43:56,577
Unless there's something
you're not telling us.

624
00:43:57,467 --> 00:43:59,208
This is not widely known, captain,

625
00:43:59,302 --> 00:44:02,146
but the alien ships
at harvest disappeared,

626
00:44:02,238 --> 00:44:04,775
then reappeared, much closer.

627
00:44:04,874 --> 00:44:07,980
- An intrasystem jump?
- We believe so, spartan.

628
00:44:08,077 --> 00:44:09,112
Not possible.

629
00:44:09,612 --> 00:44:11,592
I can tell you that slipstream space

630
00:44:11,681 --> 00:44:14,389
simply cannot be navigated
that accurately.

631
00:44:14,517 --> 00:44:17,964
You mean we cannot navigate it
with that kind of accuracy.

632
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:19,960
We'll take the dropship.

633
00:44:20,056 --> 00:44:22,627
I will see these spartans make it
to project Mjolnir.

634
00:44:24,294 --> 00:44:27,138
All hands to battle stations.
This is not a drill.

635
00:44:27,230 --> 00:44:30,177
Reactors to 90%. Come about to course 125.

636
00:44:31,034 --> 00:44:32,638
All hands, brace for impact.

637
00:44:42,812 --> 00:44:44,883
<i>We were being hunted down
like dogs.</i>

638
00:44:44,981 --> 00:44:49,088
<i>Our only chance was whatever
was down in that testing facility.</i>

639
00:45:01,497 --> 00:45:04,137
<i>They call themselves the covenant.</i>

640
00:45:21,084 --> 00:45:25,260
Energy shields. That's amazing.

641
00:45:25,755 --> 00:45:28,497
Bring the ship around. And arm the Mac.

642
00:45:34,497 --> 00:45:39,606
<i>Unlike the missiles, the Mac round
101 is an unguided projectile,</i>

643
00:45:39,702 --> 00:45:43,149
<i>so the firing solution has to be
perfectly aligned to hit.</i>

644
00:46:17,273 --> 00:46:19,184
Ready another Mac round.

645
00:46:19,275 --> 00:46:21,255
Mac system destroyed, captain.

646
00:46:21,344 --> 00:46:24,223
The commonwealth carries
nuclear missiles, correct?

647
00:46:24,314 --> 00:46:27,921
Detonation at this range
will destroy us as well.

648
00:46:28,017 --> 00:46:29,223
Excuse me, sir.

649
00:46:29,319 --> 00:46:32,061
The alien tactics have been
unnecessarily vicious.

650
00:46:32,155 --> 00:46:34,726
They didn't have to take
that second Mac round.

651
00:46:34,824 --> 00:46:38,362
In my opinion, sir, they would
engage anything that challenged them.

652
00:46:39,329 --> 00:46:41,070
They're sending a message.

653
00:46:41,164 --> 00:46:45,306
Longsword squadron delta,
get those ships into the black, boys.

654
00:46:46,703 --> 00:46:48,205
Buy us some time.

655
00:46:48,304 --> 00:46:50,306
<i>Roger that, sir. On our way.</i>

656
00:46:52,041 --> 00:46:53,111
Arm the nuclear warhead.

657
00:46:56,212 --> 00:46:58,658
Proximity detonator at 100 meters.

658
00:47:11,327 --> 00:47:12,772
Fire.

659
00:47:17,433 --> 00:47:19,379
Three, two...

660
00:47:34,984 --> 00:47:38,022
Power us back up. Slowly.

661
00:47:39,422 --> 00:47:40,594
Sensors coming back on.

662
00:47:40,690 --> 00:47:43,170
All longsword interceptors vaporized.

663
00:47:43,259 --> 00:47:46,900
Covenant ship intact, sir.

664
00:47:46,996 --> 00:47:48,839
No.

665
00:47:48,931 --> 00:47:52,310
It is moving off, though, sir.
Most likely to make repairs.

666
00:47:53,803 --> 00:47:55,009
I have my orders.

667
00:47:55,104 --> 00:47:58,711
To get you and yours
to chi ceti iv at all costs.

668
00:48:00,476 --> 00:48:02,456
<i>As we execute a flyby orbit,</i>

669
00:48:02,545 --> 00:48:05,492
<i>your dropship will take you
and your crew planet-side.</i>

670
00:48:05,581 --> 00:48:08,528
<i>If the covenant return,
we will lure them away.</i>

671
00:48:19,328 --> 00:48:23,470
<i>Damascus materials testing
facility to incoming pelican. Identify.</i>

672
00:48:23,566 --> 00:48:29,039
This is Dr. Catherine halsey,
Damascus clearance 197371-Alpha.

673
00:48:29,972 --> 00:48:33,112
<i>Doctor, you're cleared
for landing. Pad four.</i>

674
00:48:49,625 --> 00:48:51,730
This is project Mjolnir.

675
00:48:55,098 --> 00:48:57,169
<i>Mjolnir wasn't just weapons tech.</i>

676
00:48:57,266 --> 00:49:00,304
<i>It was Halsey's endgame.
Her force multiplier.</i>

677
00:49:01,170 --> 00:49:05,050
<i>We were only half of the plan.
The armor was the other.</i>

678
00:49:07,143 --> 00:49:11,057
The armor's shell is a multilayer alloy
of remarkable strength.

679
00:49:11,147 --> 00:49:14,026
An on board computer
connects with your neural interface

680
00:49:14,117 --> 00:49:16,620
to continually track tactical information.

681
00:49:16,719 --> 00:49:20,667
And the inner structure is composed
of a new reactive metal liquid crystal

682
00:49:20,756 --> 00:49:25,000
that is amorphous, yet fractually scales
and amplifies force.

683
00:49:25,094 --> 00:49:28,303
Ma'am, so you're saying
this exoskeleton enhances

684
00:49:28,397 --> 00:49:31,071
both the wearer's strength and speed?

685
00:49:31,167 --> 00:49:34,307
Yes, 104, by a multiple of five.

686
00:49:34,403 --> 00:49:37,680
- Sign me up.
- And the drawbacks, ma'am?

687
00:49:37,773 --> 00:49:40,754
This system is so reactive
that our previous tests

688
00:49:40,843 --> 00:49:44,381
with unaugmented volunteers
ended in failure.

689
00:49:46,749 --> 00:49:50,026
<i>The amplified movements broke their bones,
tore their muscles.</i>

690
00:49:50,119 --> 00:49:53,726
Their own agony-induced spasms
killed them.

691
00:49:53,823 --> 00:49:55,734
But you are not normal humans.

692
00:49:55,825 --> 00:49:58,465
Your enhanced musculature and skeletons

693
00:49:58,561 --> 00:50:01,440
should be enough to allow you
to harness the armor's power.

694
00:50:02,265 --> 00:50:05,644
- Now, I'll need a...
- I'll do it. I'll be first.

695
00:50:06,769 --> 00:50:08,510
I thought you might.

696
00:50:10,806 --> 00:50:13,446
<i>Of course, John volunteered.</i>

697
00:50:13,543 --> 00:50:17,218
<i>He was always the first to explore
the unknown for the rest of us.</i>

698
00:50:21,684 --> 00:50:24,358
Move very slowly, deliberately.

699
00:50:24,453 --> 00:50:29,027
The armor cannot be powered down,
the response cannot be scaled back.

700
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:33,670
It's shifting.

701
00:50:33,763 --> 00:50:37,711
Each suit has a gel-filled
layer to regulate temperature and fit.

702
00:50:39,635 --> 00:50:43,640
- John, ready for your first step?
- Yes, ma'am.

703
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:47,319
<i>We couldn't watch,
but we couldn't turn away.</i>

704
00:50:47,910 --> 00:50:51,289
<i>If felt like the entire fate of humanity
lay in one step.</i>

705
00:50:52,048 --> 00:50:53,959
Come on, man, you got this.

706
00:50:58,955 --> 00:51:01,629
It's lighter than I expected.

707
00:51:01,958 --> 00:51:03,335
Easy now.

708
00:51:08,164 --> 00:51:10,303
Well? How does it feel?

709
00:51:13,569 --> 00:51:16,015
Like I was made to wear it, ma'am.

710
00:51:18,808 --> 00:51:22,119
<i>John was right.
He was made to wear it.</i>

711
00:51:22,211 --> 00:51:23,690
<i>We all were.</i>

712
00:51:33,222 --> 00:51:37,568
Spartans, this is what we've
trained our entire lives to do.

713
00:51:37,660 --> 00:51:40,800
If we lose here, we lose everything.

714
00:51:41,597 --> 00:51:44,874
- Let's send our own message.
- Sir, yes, sir!

715
00:51:44,967 --> 00:51:46,742
Commonwealth to Dr. halsey.

716
00:51:46,836 --> 00:51:48,440
I'm here, captain.

717
00:51:48,537 --> 00:51:50,073
<i>The covenant ship is moving.</i>

718
00:51:50,172 --> 00:51:53,119
<i>They'll be on us inside 10 minutes.</i>

719
00:51:53,209 --> 00:51:56,486
<i>I'm sorry, doctor.
It looks as if you're on your own.</i>

720
00:51:57,113 --> 00:52:01,186
Dr. halsey, let us take a shot.
We're the best possible option.

721
00:52:01,284 --> 00:52:02,854
Your only option.

722
00:52:02,952 --> 00:52:05,455
Blue team is ready, and you know it.

723
00:52:05,554 --> 00:52:06,624
<i>John was right.</i>

724
00:52:06,722 --> 00:52:10,829
<i>And halsey either did know it,
or at least knew better than to argue.</i>

725
00:52:11,927 --> 00:52:13,463
Godspeed, John.

726
00:52:20,536 --> 00:52:24,109
I'm just saying, you could have
volunteered red team instead.

727
00:52:24,206 --> 00:52:26,743
You want me to pull over?
Let you out right here?

728
00:52:26,842 --> 00:52:30,517
As chief Mendez would say,
"it's a long walk home."

729
00:52:31,247 --> 00:52:34,057
Look, you know I trust you and everything,

730
00:52:34,817 --> 00:52:38,355
but how are we supposed to take on
a covenant ship in a pelican?

731
00:52:38,688 --> 00:52:40,634
Drown them in our blood?

732
00:52:41,390 --> 00:52:44,894
I was thinking, the commonwealth's
pelicans are carrying nukes.

733
00:52:44,994 --> 00:52:46,769
Nukes won't even scratch 'em.

734
00:52:46,862 --> 00:52:51,311
No. Not from outside their ship.

735
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:52,470
That's right.

736
00:52:52,568 --> 00:52:55,105
We can't beat them
with brute force, remember?

737
00:52:55,204 --> 00:52:57,684
Scalpels, surgical precision.

738
00:53:01,844 --> 00:53:04,120
We're small enough,
they won't see us coming.

739
00:53:04,213 --> 00:53:05,191
I hope.

740
00:53:05,281 --> 00:53:06,555
Gear up.

741
00:53:11,253 --> 00:53:14,530
Ship's on autopilot.
Course can be tracked via our hud.

742
00:53:14,623 --> 00:53:17,797
You heard this plan?
And we're still doing it?

743
00:53:17,893 --> 00:53:21,204
I think it's a great plan.
I seriously love this plan!

744
00:53:22,798 --> 00:53:26,109
I'm on board. I love this plan.

745
00:53:26,202 --> 00:53:27,704
I love it, too.

746
00:53:29,171 --> 00:53:31,242
All right, here we go.

747
00:53:31,340 --> 00:53:34,446
John? If we miss...

748
00:53:36,278 --> 00:53:37,518
We won't.

749
00:53:50,826 --> 00:53:52,169
The turrets!

750
00:53:52,261 --> 00:53:55,003
The shields have to at least
Iris for them to fire.

751
00:53:55,097 --> 00:53:57,373
If we time this right,
we're behind their shields.

752
00:53:57,767 --> 00:53:59,747
We time it wrong, we're smoke.

753
00:53:59,835 --> 00:54:02,213
Sam, Kelly, with me.

754
00:54:02,304 --> 00:54:04,750
Fred, Linda, take the other side.

755
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:06,683
We'll rendezvous somewhere in the middle.

756
00:54:10,479 --> 00:54:11,890
On my mark.

757
00:54:14,083 --> 00:54:15,926
Mark! Go! Go! Go!

758
00:54:28,764 --> 00:54:30,675
I'm not going to make it!

759
00:54:35,738 --> 00:54:37,376
Everyone makes it.

760
00:54:49,218 --> 00:54:50,526
I need intel.

761
00:54:51,587 --> 00:54:54,796
I've got Cherenkov radiation
readings from all over the ship.

762
00:54:54,890 --> 00:54:56,528
Could be anything.

763
00:54:57,726 --> 00:55:01,230
Agreed, but the largest reading
is coming from the center.

764
00:55:01,430 --> 00:55:03,034
Likely the ship's reactor.

765
00:55:12,475 --> 00:55:15,456
Sam, you take point.
Kelly, in the middle, guiding the way.

766
00:55:16,312 --> 00:55:18,223
I'll bring up the rear.

767
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:33,499
<i>The pressure doors were immense.</i>

768
00:55:33,596 --> 00:55:37,544
<i>The ceilings were three meters high,
the air thick and oily.</i>

769
00:55:38,534 --> 00:55:40,775
<i>Different symbols, different languages.</i>

770
00:55:41,337 --> 00:55:45,444
<i>Oni had theorized the covenant
was more than just one race.</i>

771
00:55:45,541 --> 00:55:47,282
<i>This helped confirm it.</i>

772
00:56:14,870 --> 00:56:16,941
They aren't bulletproof.
Good to know.

773
00:56:18,974 --> 00:56:22,285
Collect samples. Tissue, armor, weapons.

774
00:56:22,378 --> 00:56:23,914
Oni will want it.

775
00:56:24,046 --> 00:56:25,719
Think we should've tried
communicating?

776
00:56:25,814 --> 00:56:27,919
They understood us just fine.

777
00:56:28,717 --> 00:56:31,220
Come on.
We don't know what else is on the way.

778
00:56:38,627 --> 00:56:39,765
Clear.

779
00:57:10,125 --> 00:57:11,502
John!

780
00:57:12,995 --> 00:57:15,942
<i>My heart stopped
when Sam took the shot in the chest.</i>

781
00:57:33,315 --> 00:57:36,558
I'm okay.
Just burns like nothing else.

782
00:57:36,652 --> 00:57:39,792
You'll be fine.
But biofoam won't seal this.

783
00:57:39,888 --> 00:57:41,526
That was stupid, Sam.

784
00:57:41,624 --> 00:57:44,161
- You did the same thing for me.
- That was different.

785
00:57:44,326 --> 00:57:46,829
They can't afford to lose you, John.

786
00:57:56,271 --> 00:57:58,717
This is the source
of the radiation spike.

787
00:57:58,807 --> 00:58:00,445
I have no idea what it is.

788
00:58:00,542 --> 00:58:02,613
Doesn't matter,
as long as it explodes.

789
00:58:02,711 --> 00:58:04,622
I'll arm the warhead, you two...

790
00:58:04,713 --> 00:58:05,885
Contacts!

791
00:58:12,221 --> 00:58:15,031
- They've got shields.
- Only in the front.

792
00:58:26,802 --> 00:58:30,375
I'll seal the door.
John, finish arming that warhead.

793
00:58:40,983 --> 00:58:44,760
<i>I remember thinking
that no matter how dark the future,</i>

794
00:58:44,853 --> 00:58:47,026
<i>we could face it as a team.</i>

795
00:58:48,590 --> 00:58:51,161
Warhead countdown set. Let's move!

796
00:58:51,260 --> 00:58:52,603
<i>Or so I thought.</i>

797
00:58:54,463 --> 00:58:55,874
You guys should get moving.

798
00:58:55,964 --> 00:58:58,638
You guys? You're not coming?

799
00:58:58,734 --> 00:58:59,838
Kelly...

800
00:58:59,935 --> 00:59:02,472
No! We don't leave anyone behind.

801
00:59:03,205 --> 00:59:04,707
My suit is breached.

802
00:59:06,642 --> 00:59:09,418
I step into that vacuum
and I'm dead anyway.

803
00:59:11,947 --> 00:59:16,293
No. No! We don't leave
anyone behind!

804
00:59:18,554 --> 00:59:22,502
He's not staying to die, Kelly.
He's staying to fight.

805
00:59:22,591 --> 00:59:26,767
Go. Our new friends aren't gonna wait
for us to argue.

806
00:59:30,766 --> 00:59:36,182
<i>I know spartans don't cry,
but for once, I was glad for the helmet.</i>

807
00:59:41,410 --> 00:59:44,482
<i>Sam was our first loss since augmentation.</i>

808
00:59:53,322 --> 00:59:55,131
<i>We thought training,</i>

809
00:59:55,224 --> 01:00:00,731
<i>augmentation, armor made us untouchable,
invulnerable, immortal.</i>

810
01:00:02,131 --> 01:00:03,405
<i>Blue team.</i>

811
01:00:04,867 --> 01:00:06,938
<i>We were wrong.</i>

812
01:00:07,035 --> 01:00:08,639
<i>We were children.</i>

813
01:00:10,873 --> 01:00:14,082
<i>This was the only thing
John was ever afraid of.</i>

814
01:00:14,543 --> 01:00:16,045
<i>Losing one of us.</i>

815
01:00:25,587 --> 01:00:28,329
<i>And we knew
we weren't finishing this fight,</i>

816
01:00:28,423 --> 01:00:30,266
<i>we were just getting started.</i>

817
01:00:59,855 --> 01:01:01,425
<i>I was 14 then.</i>

818
01:01:01,523 --> 01:01:04,436
<i>Ah I can think about was that day.</i>

819
01:01:07,095 --> 01:01:09,803
<i>Sam carved our mark into the world,</i>

820
01:01:09,898 --> 01:01:13,539
<i>right here in the wilderness,
before it was all burned.</i>

821
01:01:14,937 --> 01:01:16,507
For Sam.

822
01:01:16,605 --> 01:01:17,709
For Sam.

823
01:01:19,174 --> 01:01:24,624
Sam fell first, and yet he showed us
that the covenant could be killed.

824
01:01:24,713 --> 01:01:27,455
Sam proved we could win this war.

825
01:01:27,549 --> 01:01:30,962
Every battle won is built
on the foundation of that sacrifice.

826
01:01:32,221 --> 01:01:36,897
If we survive this,
it's because Sam showed us the way.

827
01:01:39,828 --> 01:01:40,966
Chief?

828
01:01:42,130 --> 01:01:46,374
Sam was my friend.
He was my brother.

829
01:01:48,170 --> 01:01:50,172
He was our brother.

830
01:01:54,142 --> 01:01:58,591
Last time we were here,
I asked Sam to trust me to take us home,

831
01:01:59,314 --> 01:02:00,588
to follow me.

832
01:02:02,985 --> 01:02:04,828
Will you trust me now?

833
01:02:06,755 --> 01:02:08,462
Will you follow me?
