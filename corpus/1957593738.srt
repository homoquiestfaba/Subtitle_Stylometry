00:00:01,921 --> 00:00:04,754
(Multicom Jingle)

2
00:00:13,742 --> 00:00:17,242
(somber orchestral music)

3
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:25,643
(ominous orchestral music)

4
00:02:57,146 --> 00:02:58,766
- Stop!

5
00:02:58,766 --> 00:02:59,599
You doing?

6
00:03:00,731 --> 00:03:01,981
Get off of me.

7
00:03:04,032 --> 00:03:05,368
(Adrianne cries out)

8
00:03:05,368 --> 00:03:06,535
Stop it, stop!

9
00:03:08,337 --> 00:03:09,408
(David grunts)

10
00:03:09,408 --> 00:03:14,408
(hand weight thuds)
(Adrianne cries out)

11
00:03:23,464 --> 00:03:27,047
(disjointed ominous music)

12
00:04:04,852 --> 00:04:07,269
(gun firing)

13
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,320
- Diane's beautiful eyes have always

14
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,520
played the strings of
my heart effortlessly.

15
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,953
I couldn't imagine life without her.

16
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:39,803
Not for a second did I wanna lose her.

17
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:45,127
I was totally in love with
her and always will be.

18
00:04:45,127 --> 00:04:47,544
(bell rings)

19
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:50,000
- Guys, most really suck.

20
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,440
You are so lucky to have David

21
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,925
even though he does go to Manning.

22
00:04:52,925 --> 00:04:54,344
- Oh, I know.

23
00:04:54,344 --> 00:04:56,980
- Ooh, although Billy's
pretty cute, don't you think?

24
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:58,200
- I haven't noticed.

25
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,130
- Oh, come on.

26
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:01,340
- No, I mean, it's just you know,

27
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:03,530
David and me are really special.

28
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:06,550
- Yeah, but I mean just
hypothetically speaking.

29
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:08,830
Let's suppose David never knew.

30
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:09,940
- There is no suppose.

31
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:12,580
I mean, David and me,
it's not just because

32
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:15,330
we're getting married and we're
gonna be together forever.

33
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:17,540
It's like we're the same person in a way

34
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:19,130
and always have been.

35
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:22,210
It's kind of hard to put
into words. (chuckles)

36
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:24,080
- Yeah, but I at least
wish I had a relationship

37
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,310
I could put into words.

38
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:26,170
- Oh, you will.

39
00:05:27,135 --> 00:05:29,000
If you want something bad
enough, things just come to you.

40
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,010
I mean, that's been my experience.

41
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:32,200
- I want Billy.

42
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,423
- I think you should aim higher.

43
00:05:34,423 --> 00:05:36,170
- (chuckles) It's easy for you to say.

44
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:37,230
You have David.

45
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:38,690
- Yeah, David's special, it's true.

46
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:41,147
He'd do anything in the world for me.

47
00:05:41,147 --> 00:05:42,428
(Susie chuckles)

48
00:05:42,428 --> 00:05:43,261
(drumsticks tapping rhythmically)

49
00:05:43,261 --> 00:05:44,970
- At close interval.

50
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:46,400
Dress right, dress!

51
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,880
- [Announcer] And now if y'all would rise

52
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,790
for the presentation of
the colors by the members

53
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:52,129
of the Manning High ROTC.
- Ready!

54
00:05:52,129 --> 00:05:53,698
Front!

55
00:05:53,698 --> 00:05:55,448
Color Guard, fall in!

56
00:05:58,963 --> 00:06:00,380
Quickstep, halt.

57
00:06:01,502 --> 00:06:02,585
Present arms.

58
00:06:05,747 --> 00:06:09,497
("The Star-Spangled Banner")

59
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,466
(crowd cheering)

60
00:07:00,466 --> 00:07:01,716
- [Coach] Left!

61
00:07:02,939 --> 00:07:03,772
Aw, come on.

62
00:07:03,772 --> 00:07:06,537
- [David] Even though we
went to different schools,

63
00:07:06,537 --> 00:07:08,455
Diane and I created and lived in our own

64
00:07:08,455 --> 00:07:10,224
separate, wonderful world.

65
00:07:10,224 --> 00:07:11,350
(crowd chattering)
- That was embarrassing.

66
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:12,790
- How'd we look?

67
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:14,900
- You looked magnificent.

68
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,533
Greenish brown female sheep.

69
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:19,870
- Greenish brown female sheep.

70
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:22,886
That was our secret code

71
00:07:22,886 --> 00:07:23,760
(sultry music)

72
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,290
so we could say any time, anywhere

73
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:27,690
how much we loved each other

74
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,440
and no one else would ever know.

75
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:39,730
- David, wait.

76
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:42,513
I don't wanna do anything
until, you know, David.

77
00:07:44,605 --> 00:07:46,197
Don't be mad.

78
00:07:46,197 --> 00:07:47,580
- I'm not mad, I just don't understand

79
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:49,411
what we're waiting for here.

80
00:07:49,411 --> 00:07:50,244
Do you doubt me?

81
00:07:50,244 --> 00:07:53,182
- I don't doubt you.
- So what are you (mumbles)?

82
00:07:53,182 --> 00:07:54,015
- David.
- What?

83
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:55,740
What, do you think if we make love

84
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:58,131
this is gonna change things or something?

85
00:07:58,131 --> 00:08:00,376
That only makes me think
you don't believe in us.

86
00:08:00,376 --> 00:08:01,209
- No, I do.

87
00:08:01,209 --> 00:08:02,797
- Okay.
- It's just that,

88
00:08:02,797 --> 00:08:06,920
David, my virginity's something
I can only give you once.

89
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,350
- I know.

90
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:09,270
Well that's important to me, too,

91
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:12,808
but you think waiting four years
is gonna make a difference?

93
00:08:15,932 --> 00:08:17,364

- Forever and ever.

106
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:55,290
Diane had always held her virginity

107
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:56,933
as one of her highest virtues.

108
00:08:58,530 --> 00:08:59,886
When we agreed to be married,

109
00:08:59,886 --> 00:09:00,719
I love you,

110
00:09:00,719 --> 00:09:02,210
she finally let her guard down long enough

111
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:05,023
for our teenage hormones to kick in.

112
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:11,863
- [Salesman] Nice ring, young lady.

113
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,113
60 days to redeem those guns, young man.

114
00:09:26,794 --> 00:09:29,700
- Oh, it's so beautiful I
wanna wear it right now.

115
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,193
- Isn't that bad luck?

116
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,393
- We make our own luck.

117
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,790
I'm so hungry I could eat my boots.

118
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:48,020
Pull in at the Texas Roaster, okay?

119
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,520
- We can't, we're gonna be late.

120
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,363
- David.

121
00:09:51,477 --> 00:09:53,277
- All right, we'll do drive-through.

122
00:10:04,015 --> 00:10:05,580
- Thanks.

123
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,500
Hi, Texas Roasters, may I take your order?

124
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,197
- Can I get a couple of crispy
chicken sandwiches, please?

125
00:10:10,197 --> 00:10:11,199
Fries?

126
00:10:11,199 --> 00:10:14,260
A couple of fries, a
couple of shakes, yes?

127
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:15,093
Anything else?

128
00:10:15,093 --> 00:10:15,926
- Nope.

129
00:10:15,926 --> 00:10:16,759
- And that's all.

130
00:10:16,759 --> 00:10:17,670
- Okay, two crispy chickens,

131
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:19,830
two larges fries, and two shakes.

132
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:23,419
Okay, just pull up to the
99th window and get your food.

133
00:10:23,419 --> 00:10:26,002
(girls giggle)

134
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:32,180
Welcome to Texas Roasters,
may I take your order?

135
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:33,640
- [Customer] Two roasters
and fries, please.

136
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,820
- Okay, two roasters and two fries.

137
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,332
Okay, pull up to the window.

138
00:10:37,332 --> 00:10:40,242
Thank you.

139
00:10:40,242 --> 00:10:41,650
Hey, y'all.

140
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:42,483
- Hey, A.J.

141
00:10:42,483 --> 00:10:43,751
That was you, huh?

142
00:10:43,751 --> 00:10:44,587
- [Adrianne] Yep.

143
00:10:44,587 --> 00:10:45,420
How y'all doin'?

144
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:46,380
You all set for regionals?

145
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,760
- Oh yeah.
- A.J.,

146
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,090
he's here again.

147
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:50,400
- Oh, I'm sorry.

148
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,400
I'll see ya around, David.

149
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,578
- All right.
- Hey.

150
00:10:54,578 --> 00:10:55,880
- Is she all right?
- Yeah,

151
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,750
just some boy keeps stoppin' by.

152
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,063
Drive careful, y'all.

153
00:10:59,063 --> 00:11:00,730
- [David] All right.

154
00:11:02,784 --> 00:11:04,807
- [Boy] I'm serious.

155
00:11:04,807 --> 00:11:06,612
- [Girl] Marcy, come here.

156
00:11:06,612 --> 00:11:09,190
- [Marcy] I said I was
gonna come, didn't I?

157
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:10,606
- [Boy] Gimme 50 cents.

158
00:11:10,606 --> 00:11:13,773
- [Boy] What, you don't have a wallet?

159
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:16,671
- Hey, Bryan.

160
00:11:16,671 --> 00:11:19,570
Can I get ya somethin' to eat?

161
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:21,500
- Is A.J. around?

162
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,333
- Not right now.

163
00:11:24,749 --> 00:11:29,423
Bryan, I think she's
dating somebody, ya know?

164
00:11:29,423 --> 00:11:31,427
- I just wanted to talk to her.

165
00:11:33,423 --> 00:11:35,540
Well, tell her I said hey.

166
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:36,577
- Okay.

167
00:11:36,577 --> 00:11:37,410
Bye-bye.

168
00:11:38,503 --> 00:11:40,313
- [Employee] You gotta
get some out of the fryer.

169
00:11:40,313 --> 00:11:41,977
- I feel so bad hidin' like this.

170
00:11:41,977 --> 00:11:43,810
- It's a kindness, A.J.

171
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:45,567
- Well, I could at least talk to him.

172
00:11:45,567 --> 00:11:48,850
- You did, and now he follows
you around like a puppy.

173
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:50,310
Don't worry about him.

174
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:53,640
- He just seems so sad
all the time, ya know?

175
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,970
Welcome to Texas Roasters,
may I take your order?

176
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:57,663
- Who was she, the little blonde?

177
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:00,050
- Her name's A.J.

178
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:01,720
She's on the cross country team.

179
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:04,710
- She's cute, can she run?

180
00:12:06,307 --> 00:12:07,585
- I don't know.

181
00:12:07,585 --> 00:12:09,502

'cause you haven't said two words to me.

285
00:18:59,022 --> 00:19:02,855
- I'm just tired from
the track meet, ya know.

286
00:19:03,818 --> 00:19:06,787
- You're not goin' steady
with somebody are you?

287
00:19:06,787 --> 00:19:09,617
'Cause I've never seen you
with anybody at school at all.

288
00:19:11,365 --> 00:19:15,047

290
00:19:18,967 --> 00:19:20,723

293
00:19:28,437 --> 00:19:31,630
- She got the tar beat out of
her by that girl Marguerite.

294
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:34,470
I testified in court, did you know that?

295
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:36,150
She had to have her face
rebuilt all on account

296
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:38,413
of messin' with Marguerite's
steady boyfriend.

297

298
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:45,543

299
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:49,300
just so we're clear on that.

00:20:00,394 --> 00:20:03,380

I'm gonna share 'em.

315
00:20:20,379 --> 00:20:21,620
Yeah, I forgot it.

I'll get some later.
- Good to see ya again.

317
00:20:23,588 --> 00:20:24,466

318
00:20:24,466 --> 00:20:25,406

- Bye.
- Bye.

321
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:28,757
- [Val] Well that was quick.

322
00:20:28,757 --> 00:20:30,998
I wonder what they're off to do.

323
00:20:30,998 --> 00:20:31,831
- David.

324
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:34,053
David, did you hear me?

325
00:20:36,832 --> 00:20:38,040
That's the third time today.

326
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,290
What's going on with you?

327
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:41,443
- Nothing.

328
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:49,240
Come on, Diane, the movie
starts in 20 minutes.

329
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,500
- David, wait a minute.

330
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:53,114
David, we're not going to the movies.

331
00:20:53,114 --> 00:20:56,870
- We're not goin' now?
- Why don't you just come over

332
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:57,940
and sit down for a minute.

333
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:59,040
I need to talk to you.

334
00:21:01,759 --> 00:21:03,520
- What's up?

335
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,156
- You've been troubled lately.

336
00:21:06,156 --> 00:21:07,453
Something's going on.

337
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:12,393
- I don't know what you mean.

338
00:21:12,393 --> 00:21:13,670
- I know you.

339
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:16,360
You can't lie to me, don't you know that?

340
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:19,003
So, come on and just get it over with.

341
00:21:23,057 --> 00:21:24,893
Out with it, David, what is it?

342
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:27,043
Another woman?

343
00:21:31,975 --> 00:21:34,475
(David sighs)

344
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:36,723
Who?

345
00:21:38,262 --> 00:21:39,095
- It was

346
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:43,250
A.J. from the track team.

347
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:44,200
You don't know her.

348
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,840
- The girl from the fried chicken place.

349
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:53,563
So, how did it happen?

350
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:56,500
I mean, don't make me drag it out of you.

351
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,260
- It just happened.

352
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:02,570
I mean, I was at the track
meat and we were talking,

353
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:03,403
and then,

354
00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:07,860
I don't know, we sat on the bus together.

355
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:11,707
I was talkin' to her and then

356
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:17,580
she kissed me and...

357
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:18,413
- Go on.

358
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:21,100
- I don't know.

359
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:26,160
She needed a ride home so
I said I'd give her a ride,

360
00:22:27,174 --> 00:22:28,007
and

361
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:32,400
we didn't go straight there,

362
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,963
we stopped at the school first.

363
00:22:36,504 --> 00:22:37,443
- What did you do?

364
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:49,383
- I had

365
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,710
carnal knowledge of her.

366
00:22:57,790 --> 00:22:58,667
(somber music)

367
00:22:58,667 --> 00:22:59,830
(Diane grunts)

368
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:01,225
- Oh God. (sobbing)

369
00:23:01,225 --> 00:23:02,324
- [David] Oh God.

370
00:23:02,324 --> 00:23:03,501
- No. (sobbing)

371
00:23:03,501 --> 00:23:04,720
- [David] Diane.

372
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,929
- [Diane] Oh my God.

373
00:23:05,929 --> 00:23:07,157
- Oh God, Diane.
- No.

374
00:23:07,157 --> 00:23:08,686
No.
- I'll do anything.

375
00:23:08,686 --> 00:23:09,519
Just tell me what

376
00:23:09,519 --> 00:23:11,476
you want me to do.
- No. Oh my God.

377
00:23:11,476 --> 00:23:14,059
(sobbing) Why?

378
00:23:15,542 --> 00:23:16,720
Oh, go away!

379
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,414
I gave up my virginity for you.

380
00:23:19,414 --> 00:23:20,777
- I love you.
- For us!

381
00:23:20,777 --> 00:23:23,655
Oh my God. (sobbing)

382
00:23:23,655 --> 00:23:25,134
Why?

383
00:23:25,134 --> 00:23:25,967
- I'm sorry.
- This isn't

384
00:23:25,967 --> 00:23:26,929
supposed to happen.

385
00:23:26,929 --> 00:23:28,346
This wasn't supposed to happen.

386
00:23:28,346 --> 00:23:29,313
- I am so sorry.
- This can't be allowed

387
00:23:29,313 --> 00:23:33,920
to happen. (sobbing)

388
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:38,920
Why? (sobbing)

389
00:23:38,953 --> 00:23:41,170
- [David] For at least
an hour she screamed sobs

390
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:43,338
I wouldn't have thought possible.

391
00:23:43,338 --> 00:23:44,512
(Diane sobbing)

392
00:23:44,512 --> 00:23:45,345
It wasn't just jealousy.

393
00:23:45,345 --> 00:23:46,670
For Diane
- Why?

394
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:50,144
- she'd been betrayed,
deceived, and forgotten.

395
00:23:50,144 --> 00:23:52,811
(Diane sobbing)

396
00:23:57,049 --> 00:23:58,753
- I don't think it was your fault.

397
00:24:01,278 --> 00:24:03,643
Women have ways of makin'
a man forget himself.

398
00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:09,307
She knew what she was doin'.

399
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,620
So therefore she must
suffer the consequences.

400
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:16,570
- Whatever you say.

401
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:19,283
- It's the only way.

402
00:24:21,531 --> 00:24:25,097
And when she's gone,
we can go on as before,

403
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,343
but not until.

404
00:24:29,642 --> 00:24:30,475
You understand?

405
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:33,583
- Yeah.

406
00:24:34,877 --> 00:24:37,253
- She'll have to suffer the consequences.

407
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,113
She will have to die.

408
00:24:45,906 --> 00:24:47,540

Larry, out, out.

416
00:24:57,450 --> 00:24:59,550
- [David] I didn't have any
harsh feelings for Adrianne,

417
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:02,949

was damaged by my thoughtless actions,

421
00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:12,850
the only thing that could
satisfy her womanly vengeance

422
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:16,150

00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:52,740
He was real upset so I
didn't wanna cut him off.

537
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:57,500
No, he just wanted to
talk, ya know. (chuckles)

538
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:00,403
So, what about us, where were we?

539
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:03,113
Yeah.
- Time.

540
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:14,103
- [Linda] You know how you get

541
00:30:14,103 --> 00:30:15,280
when you don't get enough sleep.

542
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,573
- Mom, don't worry.

543
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:19,130
I'll see you tomorrow.

544
00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:20,157
- 'Night, baby.

545
00:30:20,157 --> 00:30:21,157
- Goodnight.

546
00:30:22,533 --> 00:30:25,116
(somber music)

547
00:31:10,512 --> 00:31:11,679
Well hi there.

548
00:31:20,606 --> 00:31:23,439
(engine rumbling)

549
00:32:05,542 --> 00:32:08,709
(train whistle blows)

550
00:32:15,738 --> 00:32:18,821
(soft ominous music)

551
00:32:31,526 --> 00:32:32,886
- [Linda] Hon, will you get them?

552
00:32:32,886 --> 00:32:33,781
- [Bill] Okay, guys, let's go.

553
00:32:33,781 --> 00:32:34,614
Come on, come on.
- Come on!

554
00:32:34,614 --> 00:32:36,823
- [Bill] Hup, hup, let's go.
- Whoa, we're gonna be late.

555
00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:39,033
Oh get over--
- Good morning, baby.

556
00:32:39,033 --> 00:32:39,866
- Hi, baby.

557
00:32:39,866 --> 00:32:41,140
Sit down here.

558
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:41,973
Who cares?

559
00:32:41,973 --> 00:32:44,527
I want you to eat now
because we're late, again.

560
00:32:48,683 --> 00:32:50,573
Hey, not with your fingers.

561
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:52,393
Adrianne?

562
00:32:56,611 --> 00:32:57,444
Adrianne!

563
00:32:58,901 --> 00:33:00,093
Adrianne, you up?

564
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:11,500
- Another late night?

565
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:13,500
- Too late for him to drive home anyway.

566
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:15,713
I've got a test.

567
00:33:16,846 --> 00:33:18,220
- [Carlos] Hey, David.

568
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:20,370
- Where's my lunch?
- Didn't see your car.

569
00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:22,480
- It's just down the block.

570
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,820
- [Gloria] You two are up early.

571
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:25,750
- I have a test, I told you.

572
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:27,511
We're leaving early.

573
00:33:27,511 --> 00:33:29,928
- [Carlos] Let's go, come on.

574
00:33:52,348 --> 00:33:53,818
(detectives chattering)

575
00:33:53,818 --> 00:33:54,991
- [Officer] Okay, I'll check.

576
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:57,544
- [Officer] By the way,
you left it up there.

577
00:33:57,544 --> 00:33:59,430
- [Dispatcher] Full connect, 45, roger.

578
00:33:59,430 --> 00:34:01,520
- [Officer] I'm gonna
make some molds here also.

579
00:34:03,994 --> 00:34:08,994
Yeah, I've got some
(mumbles), I'll get it.

580
00:34:09,864 --> 00:34:12,710
- [Officer] Charlie, give me
a hand over here, will ya?

581
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:14,618
- [Officer] All the way down
to the edge of the water.

582
00:34:14,618 --> 00:34:15,908
- [Officer] Yeah, what do you got?

583
00:34:15,908 --> 00:34:18,169
I'll have the forensics
boys take a look at this.

584
00:34:18,169 --> 00:34:19,853
- Not there.
- Okay, I'll check.

585
00:34:19,853 --> 00:34:20,686
I'll be waiting--

586
00:34:20,686 --> 00:34:22,850
- She was shot twice in the head and hit

587
00:34:22,850 --> 00:34:26,770
very hard with some sort of
blunt object, skull's crushed.

588
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:27,670
That's the puzzle.

589
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:29,443
Take a look.

590
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:34,736
All four fingers on her
left hand were crushed.

591
00:34:34,736 --> 00:34:36,887
- [Officer] Guys, give me
a hand over here, will ya?

592
00:34:36,887 --> 00:34:39,250
- She was probably trying
to protect herself.

593
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:40,580
- [Officer] What do you got?

594
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:43,540
- I'm thinking that she
was either dead or dying

595
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:44,603
before she was shot.

596
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:49,070
We're finished here.

597
00:34:55,322 --> 00:34:57,155
- [Officer] Down here.

598
00:34:59,288 --> 00:35:01,840
- [Man With Stretcher] Watch it.

599
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:02,950
- Adrianne?

600
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:03,783
Hurry up.

601
00:35:03,783 --> 00:35:05,800
Have you seen your sister?

602
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:06,633
Adrianne.

603
00:35:34,307 --> 00:35:35,140
(bell rings)

604
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:36,591
- [Girl] Oh, I'll tell Mom later.

605
00:35:36,591 --> 00:35:38,559
- Okay.
- That means practice.

606
00:35:38,559 --> 00:35:42,410
(students chattering)

607
00:35:42,410 --> 00:35:44,137
- Sorry, man.
- That's okay.

608
00:36:00,567 --> 00:36:01,895
- Move back now.
- You see what happened?

609
00:36:01,895 --> 00:36:03,529
- [Carl] How ya doin'?

610
00:36:03,529 --> 00:36:06,190
- Hey, Tom Green, Manning PD.

611
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:08,000
- Carl Baker, Tanner County.

612
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,280
You got anything?

613
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,860
- Yeah, there's a missing persons out

614
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:15,190
for an Adrianne Jones,
age 16, from Manning.

615
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:17,890
If that's not her, it's her twin sister.

616
00:36:17,890 --> 00:36:19,047
- You saw the body?

617
00:36:19,047 --> 00:36:20,124
- Okay let's put this through.
- Yeah.

618
00:36:20,124 --> 00:36:21,608
This is where you found her?

619
00:36:21,608 --> 00:36:22,640
- Right over here.

620
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,382
- I don't think she was raped.

621
00:36:24,382 --> 00:36:25,401
- Right.

622
00:36:25,401 --> 00:36:28,730
I wonder what she was doing
out here with no shoes.

623
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:29,706
Hey.

624
00:36:29,706 --> 00:36:30,653
Hey, you.

625
00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:34,310
Here, son, step back
behind this tape, come on.

626
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:35,300
- Is that blood?

627
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:36,480
Is that her blood?

628
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,500
- Yeah.

629
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:39,850
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, watch
where you're walkin'.

630
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:42,950
What's your name, son?

631
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:43,783
- Larry.

632
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,571
I'm a friend of A.J.'s,
I mean, if it is A.J.

633
00:36:47,571 --> 00:36:49,220
- [Tom] A.J.?

634
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:52,123
- Adrianne Jones, everybody
calls her A.J. at school.

635
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,410
Is it her?

636
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:56,910
- Come on, son, we need to ask you some,

637
00:36:56,910 --> 00:36:58,230
right this way, come on.

638
00:36:58,230 --> 00:36:59,990
Ask you some questions, over here.

639
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:02,690
- Hi, this is Linda Jones,
Adrianne Jones' mother.

640
00:37:02,690 --> 00:37:04,080
I called before.

641
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,680
Yeah, hi.

642
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:10,680
Yes, I called missing persons
and I've called all around

643
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:13,603
and I can't find her anywhere.

644
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:15,900
Well when?

645
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:19,253
I'm getting a, okay, I'll hold.

646
00:37:27,212 --> 00:37:28,270
Did you find her?

647
00:37:28,270 --> 00:37:29,890
- Yes, ma'am.

648
00:37:29,890 --> 00:37:32,040
I'm sorry, Ms. Jones,
your daughter's dead.

649
00:37:34,233 --> 00:37:37,816
(Linda breathing raggedly)

650
00:37:51,350 --> 00:37:55,543
Ma'am, the reason we have
to do this now is that,

651
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:00,803
actually this is a homicide investigation.

652
00:38:02,355 --> 00:38:04,188
- What does that mean?

653
00:38:05,270 --> 00:38:07,940
- Your daughter's death
wasn't an accident, Ms. Jones.

654
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:08,963
She was shot.

655
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,548
- Not an accident, you mean--

656
00:38:11,548 --> 00:38:14,950
- We need to find out who
did this so we have to--

657
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:17,253
- You mean my Adrianne was shot?

658
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:19,163
- Yes, ma'am.

659
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:21,680
And in a case like this it's important

660
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,440
that we act quickly, so.

661
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,243
- You mean deliberately murdered?

662
00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:27,923
- Yes, ma'am.

663
00:38:28,947 --> 00:38:33,772
- Oh God, (sobbing) oh my God.

664
00:38:33,772 --> 00:38:36,576
Oh my God! (sobbing)

665
00:38:36,576 --> 00:38:41,370
- Do you know where your
daughter was last night,

666
00:38:41,370 --> 00:38:42,353
who she was with?

667
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:46,300
- Um, she was, um...

668
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:54,873
No one, she went to her job and

669
00:38:57,493 --> 00:38:58,796
then she and I

670
00:38:58,796 --> 00:39:02,067
went to work out together. (sobbing)

671
00:39:03,330 --> 00:39:06,730
Oh God, are you sure? (sobbing)

672
00:39:06,730 --> 00:39:08,130
- What time was that, ma'am?

673
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:16,200
- She was ironing her school clothes

674
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:18,633
at around 11,

675
00:39:20,178 --> 00:39:21,730
I saw her.

676
00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:23,596
- And you didn't see her go out again?

677
00:39:23,596 --> 00:39:28,596
- Where was she? (crying)

678
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:31,045
- Did she talk to anybody?

679
00:39:31,045 --> 00:39:33,523
Were there any phone calls?

680
00:39:35,723 --> 00:39:36,890
- Phone calls.

681
00:39:40,363 --> 00:39:41,933
Um, yeah, yeah.

682
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:48,643
Her boyfriend, Tracy Smith, he called her.

683
00:39:53,177 --> 00:39:58,177
And we let her talk to him
even though it was after 10.

684
00:40:01,642 --> 00:40:02,842
There was somebody else,

685
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:08,273
David, or,

686
00:40:08,273 --> 00:40:10,230
I don't know, I don't remember.

687
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:12,553
The track team or
soemthin', I don't remember.

688
00:40:14,153 --> 00:40:15,643
- But she didn't go out?

689
00:40:17,523 --> 00:40:20,477
- It was a school night.

690
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:23,233
But this morning,

691
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:28,500
sometimes she gets up

692
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,913
and goes running in the morning,

693
00:40:31,905 --> 00:40:35,323
and so when she didn't
come to breakfast I thought

694
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:44,763
maybe she went to school
early, but her books were here,

695
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:49,063
and her shoes.

696
00:40:50,370 --> 00:40:55,343
She has two pair of tennis shoes
and one of 'em was missing.

697
00:40:58,347 --> 00:41:01,290
And so I thought she was out running.

698
00:41:04,651 --> 00:41:06,393
Then I found 'em in the dryer.

699
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:11,340
I used to always worry about her

700
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:16,523
gettin' hit by a car runnin'
in the dark like she did.

701
00:41:18,974 --> 00:41:23,974
Oh God, somebody killed
my little girl. (sobbing)

702
00:41:28,703 --> 00:41:33,703
Somebody killed my little girl. (sobbing)

703
00:42:11,450 --> 00:42:12,800
- [Jason] Is Adrianne dead?

704
00:42:19,910 --> 00:42:21,423
- You're Jason, aren't ya?

705
00:42:23,473 --> 00:42:24,610
Your mother's gonna need you

706
00:42:24,610 --> 00:42:26,760
to help her through this, Jason.

707
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:27,970
- I will.

708
00:42:27,970 --> 00:42:29,920
I saw a pickup truck in the night.

709
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:31,106
- You did?

710
00:42:31,106 --> 00:42:32,650
When was this?

711
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:34,552
- Last night about midnight.

712
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:35,385
- [Tom] Uh-huh.

713
00:42:35,385 --> 00:42:37,177
- I couldn't sleep so then
I looked out my window

714
00:42:37,177 --> 00:42:39,377
and I saw a white pickup
truck pullin' away.

715
00:42:41,090 --> 00:42:41,923
- You sure?

716
00:42:41,923 --> 00:42:43,023
- I think so.

717
00:42:51,032 --> 00:42:52,792
- [Principal] I'd like
to have your attention

718
00:42:52,792 --> 00:42:53,973
for a moment, please.

719
00:42:53,973 --> 00:42:55,123
I have an announcement.

720
00:42:57,380 --> 00:43:00,080
We have lost a student.

721
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:03,270
It is my sad task to inform you

722
00:43:03,270 --> 00:43:06,184
that 10th grader Adrianne Jones is dead.

723
00:43:06,184 --> 00:43:07,660
- [Student] Whoa.

724
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:08,850
- [Principal] This is a tragedy

725
00:43:08,850 --> 00:43:11,663
we will all have to deal
with in our own way,

726
00:43:13,030 --> 00:43:14,690
but she was one of Manning's own,

727
00:43:14,690 --> 00:43:18,853
and we are all saddened by her loss.

728
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:22,155
I know how all of you would like--

729
00:43:22,155 --> 00:43:23,738
- [Boy] Hey, Tommy.

730
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:26,820
- [Principal] There
will be a police inquiry

731
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:29,480
into her movements up
to the time of her death

732
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:32,030
and anyone who can offer any help

733
00:43:32,030 --> 00:43:34,083
is encouraged to come forward.

734
00:43:35,850 --> 00:43:38,420
Again, this is a shock for all of us

735
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:41,749
and a time of sadness and reflection.

736
00:43:41,749 --> 00:43:44,940
(students chattering)

737
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:45,890
- I'm sorry, David.

738
00:43:47,058 --> 00:43:50,690
Look, did you talk to A.J. last night?

739
00:43:50,690 --> 00:43:52,500
- Did I talk to Adrianne?

740
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:53,880
No, why would I?

741
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:55,930
- Because someone said
she talked to a David

742
00:43:55,930 --> 00:43:57,760
from the track team and
you were the only one

743
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,487
Coach Barr could think of.

744
00:43:59,487 --> 00:44:00,487
- Wasn't me.

745
00:44:01,550 --> 00:44:03,260
- Yeah, okay, I'm sorry to bother you.

746
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:05,300
It's just, this is so terrible

747
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:08,395
and they're gonna be talking
to everyone who knew her.

748
00:44:08,395 --> 00:44:09,695
- That's okay, no problem.

749
00:44:11,810 --> 00:44:14,620
That first day at school was the hardest,

750
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:16,770
to make it seem as though
nothing had happened

751
00:44:16,770 --> 00:44:19,930
when we were really both scared as hell.

752
00:44:23,106 --> 00:44:25,230
- [Woman On Loudspeaker]
5th period biology students

753
00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:27,033
may now report
- Well, you are

754
00:44:27,033 --> 00:44:27,866
- to the school cafeteria.
- on the track team

755
00:44:27,866 --> 00:44:29,390
and your name is David.

756
00:44:29,390 --> 00:44:30,580
- Yes, sir.
- 5th period biology students

757
00:44:30,580 --> 00:44:31,637
- But you were
- can report

758
00:44:31,637 --> 00:44:32,690
- dating her, right?
- to the school cafeteria.

759
00:44:32,690 --> 00:44:34,750
- We weren't going
steady or anything, but.

760
00:44:34,750 --> 00:44:38,200
- Okay, now, you called
her on Sunday night

761
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:41,852
and while you were talking to
her somebody called in, right?

762
00:44:41,852 --> 00:44:42,685
- [Tracy] Mm-hm.

763
00:44:43,630 --> 00:44:45,000
- You drive a pickup?

764
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:45,833
- No, sir.

765
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,310
Did the killer drive a pickup?

766
00:44:49,310 --> 00:44:51,770
- [Carl] You know anyone
who drives a white pickup?

767
00:44:51,770 --> 00:44:52,603
- No, sir.

768
00:44:52,603 --> 00:44:53,760
- [Tom] Any idea who that was?

769
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,910
- She said it was some guy named Bryan.

770
00:44:55,910 --> 00:44:57,580
- You sure it was Bryan?

771
00:44:57,580 --> 00:44:58,930
- Bryan's what she told me.

772
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:01,960
- And you say you never dated Adrianne?

773
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:04,380
- No, sir, I'm engaged to be married.

774
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:06,210
- Little young to get married, aren't ya?

775
00:45:06,210 --> 00:45:08,220
- No, sir, we already set the date.

776
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:10,250
Right after I graduate
from the Air Force Academy.

777
00:45:10,250 --> 00:45:11,133
- [Tracy] Bryan's what she told me.

778
00:45:11,133 --> 00:45:12,240
- Hopefully.

779
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:13,270
- [Tom] Not David?

780
00:45:13,270 --> 00:45:14,170
- [Tracy] No, sir.

781
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:22,240
A friend of hers who was really upset.

782
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:23,570
That's all I know.

783
00:45:23,570 --> 00:45:25,143
- Well, good luck.

784
00:45:26,007 --> 00:45:28,100
You think of anything that
might help us, give us a call.

785
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:28,933
- Yes, sir.

786
00:45:30,050 --> 00:45:31,980
- She told me I didn't know him,

787
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:34,053
so I didn't really pay it much mind.

788
00:45:35,030 --> 00:45:37,180
She put me on hold
while she talked to him.

789
00:45:38,419 --> 00:45:42,397
I didn't think she'd sneak out
to meet that guy or anything.

790
00:45:42,397 --> 00:45:43,961
- [Tom] Mm-hm.

791
00:45:43,961 --> 00:45:44,930
- But she wouldn't have
told me that exactly,

792
00:45:44,930 --> 00:45:46,550
would she have?

793
00:45:46,550 --> 00:45:49,563
- Tom, there's a Bryan
McMillen in her address book.

794
00:45:54,345 --> 00:45:55,604
- Thank you.

795
00:45:55,604 --> 00:45:59,354
(frenetic heavy metal music)

796
00:46:01,531 --> 00:46:04,422
♪ This is again ♪

797
00:46:04,422 --> 00:46:07,255
(engine rumbling)

798
00:46:13,690 --> 00:46:15,528
- Bryan McMillen?

799
00:46:15,528 --> 00:46:17,180
I'm Detective Baker from Tanner Police.

800
00:46:17,180 --> 00:46:19,670
This is Detective Green from Manning.

801
00:46:19,670 --> 00:46:20,590
We're workin' on a case.

802
00:46:20,590 --> 00:46:23,860
We were hopin' you might
be able to help us out.

803
00:46:23,860 --> 00:46:25,230
- Me?

804
00:46:25,230 --> 00:46:27,260
Is this about Adrianne Jones?

805
00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:29,893
- You don't mind answering
some questions, do you, Bryan?

806
00:46:29,893 --> 00:46:31,063
- No, why not?

807
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,850
- Of course we could check
with the phone company,

808
00:46:33,850 --> 00:46:36,053
but it would help us out if you remember.

809
00:46:36,940 --> 00:46:40,253
- Well, see the only
thing is I don't remember.

810
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:45,933
- Bryan, you either called her
Sunday night or you didn't.

811
00:46:46,809 --> 00:46:50,041
- Well, see I was drinkin' some,

812
00:46:50,041 --> 00:46:52,430
and when you mix that with the
other pills I take sometimes

813
00:46:52,430 --> 00:46:56,030
the next day it's like I
wasn't even there, ya know?

814
00:46:57,940 --> 00:46:59,860
- What kind of pills
are you takin', Bryan?

815
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:04,405
- Well, a couple of things,
for depression and all.

816
00:47:04,405 --> 00:47:06,500
- Did you go over there, Bryan?

817
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:07,737
Is it possible that you called her

818
00:47:07,737 --> 00:47:11,160
and then maybe drove by there?

819
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:13,560
Even though you were
drinking, is that possible?

820
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:17,383
- It's possible.

821
00:47:18,953 --> 00:47:20,953
I mean, I don't remember much.

822
00:47:22,090 --> 00:47:23,403
- He don't remember much.

823
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:30,164
It's all on tape and I
offered him a lawyer.

824
00:47:30,164 --> 00:47:32,190
- We don't even know if he's tracking.

825
00:47:32,190 --> 00:47:34,140
The kid's on medication for God's sake.

826
00:47:38,420 --> 00:47:40,600
- Now why were ya drinkin', then?

827
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:42,876
- I was just, ya know.

828
00:47:42,876 --> 00:47:44,580
- I know, I know.

829
00:47:44,580 --> 00:47:47,800
It's the end of the weekend,
you've got school tomorrow.

830
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:48,840
- Might as well get drunk,

831
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:50,420
bash some girl's head in with a hammer.

832
00:47:50,420 --> 00:47:51,710
- [Bryan] I'd never hurt A.J.

833
00:47:51,710 --> 00:47:52,750
- Nah, you wouldn't do that.

834
00:47:52,750 --> 00:47:54,740
You're not that kind of a guy.

835
00:47:54,740 --> 00:47:58,030
But if he is, he doesn't remember.

836
00:47:58,030 --> 00:48:00,230
- It's not my fault I
don't remember, is it?

837
00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:02,230
Look, ask anybody.

838
00:48:02,230 --> 00:48:03,063
- Who?

839
00:48:03,063 --> 00:48:04,393
Make us a list, Bryan.

840
00:48:05,230 --> 00:48:07,600
You write the names of
everybody who called Adrianne

841
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:10,110
on Sunday night because they
were really, really upset

842
00:48:10,110 --> 00:48:12,040
and depressed and had to see her.

843
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:14,273
- [Officer] Bryan, you're the
only one on that list there.

844
00:48:15,140 --> 00:48:18,046
- But even if I went there
I wouldn't have killed her.

845
00:48:18,046 --> 00:48:19,280
- But you don't remember, right?

846
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:20,483
So how do ya know?

847
00:48:22,890 --> 00:48:25,080
- All right, Bryan, had you done it,

848
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:27,350
just supposing, all right, Bryan?

849
00:48:27,350 --> 00:48:29,340
Where would ya leave the body?

850
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:30,373
What kind of place?

851
00:48:31,650 --> 00:48:32,483
- I don't know.

852
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:38,753
Away from people,
somewhere remote, a field.

853
00:48:39,610 --> 00:48:40,697
Away from houses.

854
00:48:43,262 --> 00:48:47,095
(singing in foreign language)

855
00:49:24,815 --> 00:49:26,010
- I feel so strange.

856
00:49:26,010 --> 00:49:27,346
- Shock is what it is.

857
00:49:27,346 --> 00:49:28,308
It's gonna be all right.

858
00:49:28,308 --> 00:49:29,289
- I don't know.

859
00:49:29,289 --> 00:49:30,430
- Come on, Diane, we're in the clear.

860
00:49:30,430 --> 00:49:32,217
They got that Bryan McMillen kid.

861
00:49:32,217 --> 00:49:33,800
- But he didn't do it.

862
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:34,760
- Don't worry about that.

863
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:36,760
If they can't prove he did
it, they gotta let him go.

864
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:37,750
- That's what I mean.

865
00:49:37,750 --> 00:49:39,530
They're gonna know the real
killer's still out there

866
00:49:39,530 --> 00:49:42,000
and they're never ever
gonna stop looking, never.

867
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,787
- Look, I know on TV they
always get the guy in the end,

868
00:49:43,787 --> 00:49:46,071
but in real life there's a lot of cases

869
00:49:46,071 --> 00:49:48,994
where they never figure out what happened.

870
00:49:48,994 --> 00:49:51,475
- (sighs) Maybe.

871
00:49:51,475 --> 00:49:53,047
Just need for some time to pass.

872
00:49:53,047 --> 00:49:53,880
- I know, I know.

873
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:54,713
- God, David.

874
00:49:54,713 --> 00:49:56,989
- You just gotta hang in there, okay?

875
00:49:56,989 --> 00:49:58,410
- We've been very lucky so far,

876
00:49:58,410 --> 00:50:01,024
but right now we need to tow the line.

877
00:50:01,024 --> 00:50:02,668
- You're right and we will.

878
00:50:02,668 --> 00:50:03,780
- Beautiful service.
- We have to become models

879
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:06,124
of good conduct from here on out.

880
00:50:06,124 --> 00:50:07,440
- Hi.

881
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:08,293
And we were.

882
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:11,537
We both applied to military academies.

883
00:50:11,537 --> 00:50:13,610
- [Military Officer] From
the United States Congress.

884
00:50:13,610 --> 00:50:15,491
- [David] I got my letters first.

885
00:50:15,491 --> 00:50:16,480
- [Military Officer] Dear David,

886
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,140
congratulations on your appointment

887
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:20,333
to the United States Air Force Academy.

888
00:50:21,340 --> 00:50:24,560
You have demonstrated
excellence in academics,

889
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:28,910
athletics, civics, and community service.

890
00:50:28,910 --> 00:50:32,030
You are the shining example
that we in government look to

891
00:50:32,030 --> 00:50:35,273
when we envision the future
of this great country of ours.

892
00:50:36,150 --> 00:50:39,940
The United States Military
is lucky to have you, David.

893
00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:41,573
Good luck and God speed.

894
00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:44,145
- [Woman] Jennifer, you
sit where I can see you.

895
00:50:44,145 --> 00:50:46,085
- See what ends up happening?
(group chattering)

896
00:50:46,085 --> 00:50:48,138
(upbeat Latin music)

897
00:50:48,138 --> 00:50:51,555
(party goers chattering)

898
00:51:04,603 --> 00:51:06,160
- Well, I can't stand it anymore.

899
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:07,450
Go in the house and get the letter.

900
00:51:07,450 --> 00:51:08,283
- Okay.
- Go.

901
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:12,279
Carlos?

902
00:51:12,279 --> 00:51:14,836
- (speaking in foreign
language), listen up.

903
00:51:14,836 --> 00:51:16,632
We have an announcement to make.

904
00:51:16,632 --> 00:51:17,503
- [Gloria] Listen, everyone.

905
00:51:17,503 --> 00:51:20,428
- Pressed on the envelope
is United States Navy.

906
00:51:20,428 --> 00:51:22,450
(guests applaud)
(guests cheer)

907
00:51:22,450 --> 00:51:23,639
- Let her read it.

908
00:51:23,639 --> 00:51:26,889
- Mama, I don't wanna read it out loud.

909
00:51:30,060 --> 00:51:31,373
It's from Annapolis.

910
00:51:32,850 --> 00:51:33,705
I got in!

911
00:51:33,705 --> 00:51:36,088
(guests cheer)

912
00:51:36,088 --> 00:51:37,806
(guests applaud)

913
00:51:37,806 --> 00:51:40,227
I can't believe it, I'm
accepted at Annapolis.

914
00:51:40,227 --> 00:51:42,250
I'm in the class of the year 2000.

915
00:51:42,250 --> 00:51:43,990
Can you stand it?

916
00:51:43,990 --> 00:51:46,570
- We're all so proud of you.
- Oh.

917
00:51:46,570 --> 00:51:47,420
- And David, too.

918
00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:48,750
- Oh, David, David, by the way,

919
00:51:48,750 --> 00:51:52,268
David got into West Point
and the Air Force Academy.

920
00:51:52,268 --> 00:51:57,268
(guests cheer)
(guests applaud)

921
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:05,730
- [Carl] Okay, Bryan, you
can see how this is going.

922
00:52:05,730 --> 00:52:07,920
We need to find out
everything there is to know

923
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:09,093
about you and Adrianne.

924
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:13,273
- We were just friends.

925
00:52:15,250 --> 00:52:18,260
I never hit anybody in
my life, not on purpose,

926
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:20,743
never mind bashin' their
head in with a hammer.

927
00:52:23,204 --> 00:52:26,348
- How did you know her
head was bashed in, Bryan?

928
00:52:26,348 --> 00:52:27,660
- What?

929
00:52:27,660 --> 00:52:30,250
- You said her head was
bashed in with a hammer.

930
00:52:30,250 --> 00:52:31,250
How'd you know that?

931
00:52:32,540 --> 00:52:33,850
- Somebody said it.

932
00:52:33,850 --> 00:52:37,080
- Nope, try again.
- It was on the news then.

933
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:39,490
- No, that was never
released to the media.

934
00:52:39,490 --> 00:52:42,540
That little detail is something
very few people know about.

935
00:52:42,540 --> 00:52:43,393
- But you knew.

936
00:52:45,100 --> 00:52:47,140
Where's the hammer, Bryan.

937
00:52:47,140 --> 00:52:49,860
- I didn't, somebody musta said it then,

938
00:52:49,860 --> 00:52:51,160
because I didn't kill her!

939
00:52:53,750 --> 00:52:55,416
- All right, that's enough
of this. Let's go, Bryan.

940
00:52:55,416 --> 00:52:56,249
- Oh, hey, hey!
- Hey, wait.

941
00:52:56,249 --> 00:52:57,453
- You gonna charge him?

942
00:52:58,530 --> 00:53:01,130
Don't tell me what I can
do when it comes to my son.

943
00:53:03,340 --> 00:53:04,780
- [Carl] Now, Mr. McMillen, I really think

944
00:53:04,780 --> 00:53:06,180
we oughta talk about this.
- Now, I already told

945
00:53:06,180 --> 00:53:09,100
your boss I may not be rich or a big shot,

946
00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:12,460
but you mess with my son
and I'll come after you

947
00:53:12,460 --> 00:53:14,550
or anybody else with everything I got,

948
00:53:14,550 --> 00:53:16,393
cop or no cop, you hear me?

949
00:53:27,481 --> 00:53:30,481
(crickets chirping)

950
00:53:43,997 --> 00:53:45,330
- Clear.
- Clear.

951
00:53:48,084 --> 00:53:49,861
(whistle blowing)

952
00:53:49,861 --> 00:53:53,611
(upbeat marching band music)

953
00:53:58,238 --> 00:53:59,738
- [Officer] Clear.

954
00:54:02,144 --> 00:54:05,719
Police Department, we
have a search warrant.

955
00:54:05,719 --> 00:54:07,557
Police Department!

956
00:54:07,557 --> 00:54:08,780
Put your hands in the air.

957
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:09,613
(woman screams)
Do it now.

958
00:54:09,613 --> 00:54:11,199
- [Officer] Put your hands in the air.

959
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:12,419
- [Officer] Police Department.

960
00:54:12,419 --> 00:54:13,637
Bryan McMillen, you're under arrest.

961
00:54:13,637 --> 00:54:15,266
- [Officer] Get out of
bed, get out of bed.

962
00:54:15,266 --> 00:54:17,640
- Can I put on my pants?
- Get up, come on.

963
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:20,940
- This is a very rare
and distinctive honor

964
00:54:20,940 --> 00:54:23,596
which brings credit not only to himself,

965
00:54:23,596 --> 00:54:24,429
(Jimmy cries out)

966
00:54:24,429 --> 00:54:25,290
but to his family
- Let go of me!

967
00:54:25,290 --> 00:54:27,530
- and to Manning High as well.

968
00:54:27,530 --> 00:54:31,653
And so, I present to you
our very own David Graham.

969
00:54:32,559 --> 00:54:33,392
- Thank you.

970
00:54:33,392 --> 00:54:34,225
(crowd cheers)

971
00:54:34,225 --> 00:54:35,125
- Hands up.
- What's goin' on?

972
00:54:35,125 --> 00:54:36,300
- [Officer] Get on the
ground, get on the ground.

973
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:39,259
(crowd cheering)

974
00:54:39,259 --> 00:54:41,070
- [Officer] Handcuff him.

975
00:54:41,070 --> 00:54:42,073
(crowd applauding)

976
00:54:42,073 --> 00:54:44,890
- I'll never stop loving you, Diane.

977
00:54:44,890 --> 00:54:48,078
- You better not, not
with what I've got on you.

978
00:54:48,078 --> 00:54:49,020
- [Officer] You're under arrest

979
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:50,956
for the murder of Adrianne Jones.

980
00:54:50,956 --> 00:54:53,615
(crowd cheering)

981
00:54:53,615 --> 00:54:54,776
(crowd applauding)

982
00:54:54,776 --> 00:54:59,192
(upbeat marching band music)

983
00:54:59,192 --> 00:55:01,859
- [Officer] Get him up, come on.

984
00:55:04,406 --> 00:55:06,265
(crowd cheering)

985
00:55:06,265 --> 00:55:08,932
(camera clicks)

986
00:55:22,861 --> 00:55:25,208
- What happened that night, A.J.?

987
00:55:25,208 --> 00:55:26,980
- [Val] I hear they're
gonna hook Bryan McMillen

988
00:55:26,980 --> 00:55:28,210
up to a lie detector.

989
00:55:28,210 --> 00:55:30,180
- Yeah, like Forrest Gump
mighta been the killer.

990
00:55:30,180 --> 00:55:31,450
- Now that's not kind, Larry.

991
00:55:31,450 --> 00:55:32,350
- Well it's true.

992
00:55:32,350 --> 00:55:34,130
Bryan's not exactly
arch criminal material.

993
00:55:34,130 --> 00:55:36,103
- Yeah, everybody but
the police knows that.

994
00:55:36,103 --> 00:55:36,936
- Yeah, they know it, too,

995
00:55:36,936 --> 00:55:39,150
only now they're gonna have
to do somethin' about it

996
00:55:39,150 --> 00:55:40,883
after they let old Bryan go.

997
00:55:41,746 --> 00:55:42,840
- Yeah, it'll be real again, ya know?

998
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:46,390
- Yeah, she was a real girl
and now she's really gone.

999
00:55:46,390 --> 00:55:48,540
- I still can't believe it.

1000
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:49,543
I mean, she's dead.

1001
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:53,573
She died right here.

1002
00:56:11,387 --> 00:56:14,280
- [Interviewer] Are you a
student at Manning High School?

1003
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:16,357
- [Bryan] Yeah.

1004
00:56:16,357 --> 00:56:17,410
- [Interviewer] Do you know anyone

1005
00:56:17,410 --> 00:56:19,075
that owns a white pickup truck?

1006
00:56:19,075 --> 00:56:19,992
- Yeah, no.

1007
00:56:23,243 --> 00:56:25,810
- Were you born in 1972?

1008
00:56:25,810 --> 00:56:26,643
- [Bryan] No.

1009
00:56:35,083 --> 00:56:36,060
- Bryan.
- Let's get this straight.

1010
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:37,470
Bryan is not a suspect

1011
00:56:37,470 --> 00:56:38,451
in this case
- Do you have any comments

1012
00:56:38,451 --> 00:56:39,284
- any longer.
- about your recent situation?

1013
00:56:39,284 --> 00:56:40,117
- [Man] Move over here, please.

1014
00:56:40,117 --> 00:56:41,121
- Bryan, Bryan!
- He was not released

1015
00:56:41,121 --> 00:56:42,291
for lack of evidence.
- What was your relationship

1016
00:56:42,291 --> 00:56:43,124
with Adrianne, Bryan?

1017
00:56:43,124 --> 00:56:44,647
- He was set free because he
- Mr. McMillen, what have--

1018
00:56:44,647 --> 00:56:46,689
- was arrested in error.
- Bryan look this way, please.

1019
00:56:46,689 --> 00:56:47,522
- Sir.
- Can we find out, Bryan.

1020
00:56:47,522 --> 00:56:49,095
- [Reporter] Can we get
a statement, please?

1021
00:56:49,095 --> 00:56:50,620
- His lawyer'll have
somethin' for ya later on,

1022
00:56:50,620 --> 00:56:54,020
but just give the kid a break, all right?

1023
00:56:54,020 --> 00:56:55,196
- [Reporter] Mr. McMillen,
one more question, please?

1024
00:56:55,196 --> 00:56:56,320
- Mr. McMillen.
- Sir, please.

1025
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:57,153
(somber music)

1026
00:56:57,153 --> 00:57:01,193
- What can one say about
a life ended so soon?

1027
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:05,923
She was here with us
and then she was gone.

1028
00:57:07,820 --> 00:57:11,363
It must be enough that
we celebrate her life,

1029
00:57:12,820 --> 00:57:14,853
accepting her in memory,

1030
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:18,880
and trusting in our Lord Jesus Christ

1031
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:21,653
to keep her in the hollow of his hand.

1032
00:57:27,442 --> 00:57:28,275
Larry.

1033
00:57:41,736 --> 00:57:44,403
(ominous music)

1034
00:57:49,270 --> 00:57:51,777
- [Carl] Tom, where are those files?

1035
00:57:51,777 --> 00:57:52,683
- Back here.

1036
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:56,110
- [Carl] Good.

1037
00:57:56,110 --> 00:57:58,230
- Finnegan begin again.

1038
00:57:58,230 --> 00:58:00,470
- Well she knew him, so the killer's

1039
00:58:00,470 --> 00:58:03,410
gotta be in one of these folders here.

1040
00:58:03,410 --> 00:58:04,810
- We'll find him eventually.

1041
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:07,650
Probably.

1042
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:09,810
- Yeah. (chuckles)

1043
00:58:09,810 --> 00:58:12,713
There's one, Grady, first name Pete.

1044
00:58:13,979 --> 00:58:16,610
Let's see, he was in County General

1045
00:58:16,610 --> 00:58:18,550
that night with bad tonsils.

1046
00:58:18,550 --> 00:58:19,760
- Now that's an alibi.

1047
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:21,130
- Un-huh.

1048
00:58:21,130 --> 00:58:25,200
Graham, first name David.

1049
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:26,033
- Yeah, I remember him.

1050
00:58:26,033 --> 00:58:28,050
He was on the high school track team.

1051
00:58:28,050 --> 00:58:30,210
- Yeah, that's him,
interviewed him myself.

1052
00:58:30,210 --> 00:58:32,280
- [Tom] Graham, yeah he
was going to Annapolis or--

1053
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:33,500
- No, that was his girlfriend.

1054
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:35,600
This young man is goin'
to Colorado Springs.

1055
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:36,900
- Air Force Academy?

1056
00:58:36,900 --> 00:58:37,760
Outstanding.

1057
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:39,670
- Yeah, outstanding is
right, he's a good kid.

1058
00:58:39,670 --> 00:58:41,140
Read this.

1059
00:58:41,140 --> 00:58:46,060
National Merit Finalist, athlete,
ROTC battalion commander.

1060

That young man is a recruiting poster.

1061

Ralph Buyers.

1064
00:58:53,010 --> 00:58:56,300
- I'm going home because
I actually have a life.

1065
00:58:56,300 --> 00:58:58,500
- [Carl] Hey Tom, we got
about 50 or 60 more here.

1066
00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:01,000

there Monday morning, Carl.

Oh, and Jenny Taylor?

- Really?

1093
01:00:00,790 --> 01:00:02,010
- I mean, I couldn't believe Morgan Manlee

1094
01:00:02,010 --> 01:00:03,290
would actually say something like that,

1095
01:00:03,290 --> 01:00:06,029
but you were the one who told
me she didn't like you, so.

1096
01:00:06,029 --> 01:00:06,862
- Morgan Manlee said that?

1097
01:00:06,862 --> 01:00:08,013
Who was she talking to?

1098
01:00:08,013 --> 01:00:10,636
- I don't know, she was
talking to some girl,

1099
01:00:10,636 --> 01:00:12,107
but what she said was that
David was unfaithful to you.

1100
01:00:12,107 --> 01:00:13,393
You know, with her.

1101
01:00:14,420 --> 01:00:15,260
- She's so full of it.

1102
01:00:15,260 --> 01:00:17,720
Like David would ever be unfaithful to me.

1103
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:19,540
- Yeah, but I mean, to go
and kill somebody over it?

1104
01:00:19,540 --> 01:00:21,030
- On top of which she was shot,

1105
01:00:21,030 --> 01:00:23,030
or did Morgan forget that little detail?

1106
01:00:24,510 --> 01:00:26,908
- Well yeah, but I mean her head was,

1107
01:00:26,908 --> 01:00:28,910
anyway, you have to be
some kind of lunatic

1108
01:00:28,910 --> 01:00:30,800
to do something like that.

1109
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:32,720
- Well she wasn't saying
that she saw anything.

1110
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:34,613
I mean, she wasn't talking about somebody

1111
01:00:34,613 --> 01:00:36,213
eyewitnessing anything, was she?

1112
01:00:37,546 --> 01:00:40,070
- No, it wasn't like that.

1113
01:00:40,070 --> 01:00:42,870

keep her stupid mouth shut.

Well David may think she hung the moon,

1119
01:00:54,630 --> 01:00:55,930
but I'm not seein' it.

1120
01:00:55,930 --> 01:00:57,301
- Why, what's the matter with her?

1121
01:00:57,301 --> 01:00:58,134

1122

1123

1124
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:03,140
There is a rumor goin' around

1125
01:01:03,140 --> 01:01:05,329
that David Graham's girlfriend killed A.J.

1126
01:01:05,329 --> 01:01:06,162
- What?
- You heard this

1127
01:01:06,162 --> 01:01:06,995
in the girl's room?

1128
01:01:06,995 --> 01:01:08,180
- I overheard her talking to someone,

1129
01:01:08,180 --> 01:01:09,390
her name is Diane something.

1130
01:01:09,390 --> 01:01:10,670
- Zamora, we know.

1131
01:01:10,670 --> 01:01:11,810
So give.

1132
01:01:11,810 --> 01:01:12,660
What'd she say?

1133
01:01:12,660 --> 01:01:16,030
- Well, they said that
David slept with A.J.

1134
01:01:16,030 --> 01:01:17,370
and Diane found out about it

1135
01:01:17,370 --> 01:01:18,820
and killed her with a baseball bat.

1136
01:01:18,820 --> 01:01:19,653
- What?

1137
01:01:19,653 --> 01:01:20,486
- Yeah, good, right.

1138
01:01:20,486 --> 01:01:21,930
I think that was right after they both

1139
01:01:21,930 --> 01:01:23,501
got abducted by space aliens.

1140
01:01:23,501 --> 01:01:24,334

1141
01:01:24,334 --> 01:01:26,540
- I still think it was Marguerite
if it was another girl.

1142
01:01:26,540 --> 01:01:28,050

1143
01:01:28,050 --> 01:01:28,947
A.J. testifying against her and all.

1144
01:01:28,947 --> 01:01:30,450
- Yeah, but the police have already

1145
01:01:30,450 --> 01:01:31,810
been down that road, haven't they?

1146
01:01:31,810 --> 01:01:32,810

look at me, listen to
me. Listen to me now.

1153

1154
01:01:45,460 --> 01:01:47,580
There is nothing we can do about the past.

1155

nothing can bring her back,

- Hi.

1213
01:04:01,770 --> 01:04:04,945
- Didn't see you. (chuckles)

1214
01:04:04,945 --> 01:04:06,223
What can I do for you?

1215
01:04:08,143 --> 01:04:10,523
- I just came by to talk to somebody,

1216
01:04:11,780 --> 01:04:13,437
to see what was happenin'.

1217
01:04:15,880 --> 01:04:17,280
- Well I'm sorry, Ms. Jones.

1218
01:04:18,847 --> 01:04:21,100
We're still working on
it, but the truth is

1219
01:04:21,100 --> 01:04:24,093
it's a very difficult kind of case.

1220
01:04:25,534 --> 01:04:27,383
- You mean 'cause it's been so long?

1221
01:04:29,110 --> 01:04:32,720
- What I mean is when an adult is killed

1222
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:35,970
it's easier to trace their
movements and contacts

1223
01:04:35,970 --> 01:04:39,023
and so on, but with a high school girl,

1224
01:04:40,090 --> 01:04:42,500
she literally came in contact
with hundreds of people,

1225
01:04:42,500 --> 01:04:46,870
so it's a huge investigative
job and we're doin' the best--

1226
01:04:46,870 --> 01:04:48,567
- So are you makin' any headway?

1227
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:56,050
- Ma'am, I'd like to be more optimistic,

1228
01:04:56,050 --> 01:04:59,053
but the truth is we're
not much further along.

1229
01:05:00,080 --> 01:05:01,757

1230

1234
01:05:16,663 --> 01:05:20,339
This was hers.

1235
01:05:20,339 --> 01:05:21,922
- It's very pretty.

1236
01:05:24,007 --> 01:05:25,013
- Oh, I still,

1237
01:05:27,367 --> 01:05:29,863
when the door slams I look up.

1238
01:05:32,915 --> 01:05:37,190
I know she's not comin'
home, but I still...

1239
01:05:39,960 --> 01:05:40,793
- Yes, ma'am.

1240
01:05:44,166 --> 01:05:45,833
- Don't stop trying.

1241
01:05:47,770 --> 01:05:50,619
- Bye, thanks for comin'.
- I'll be home in July.

1242
01:05:50,619 --> 01:05:51,838
- Take care.
- Take care of yourself.

1243
01:05:51,838 --> 01:05:53,030
- All right.

1244
01:05:53,030 --> 01:05:54,400
You be good now, okay?

1245
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:56,120
- I will. I'm gonna miss you so much.

1246
01:05:56,120 --> 01:05:57,920
- I'll miss you, too.

1247
01:05:57,920 --> 01:05:59,562
- Greenish brown female sheep.

1248
01:05:59,562 --> 01:06:00,395
- Me, too.

1249
01:06:01,584 --> 01:06:04,060
- [Man] Say hi to Nancy for me.

1250
01:06:04,060 --> 01:06:05,933
- Oh God, please just go, I'm dyin'.

1251
01:06:11,469 --> 01:06:12,506
- [Woman] Bye.

1252
01:06:12,506 --> 01:06:14,506
Call when you get there.

1253
01:06:19,547 --> 01:06:21,200
- Are you okay?

1254
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:23,720
- Oh Mama, I just have
this terrible feelin'.

1255
01:06:23,720 --> 01:06:25,340
- It will get better.

1256
01:06:25,340 --> 01:06:28,560
A few days and then you'll
be off on your own adventure.

1257
01:06:28,560 --> 01:06:30,380
- No, I mean I just have this awful sense

1258
01:06:30,380 --> 01:06:31,680
that everything is ending.

1259
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:34,620
- Nothing is ending.

1260
01:06:34,620 --> 01:06:37,553
It's all beginning for you, and for David.

1261
01:06:39,110 --> 01:06:41,060
- I'm so afraid.

1262
01:06:41,060 --> 01:06:43,693
- It's going to be good
for you, you'll see.

1263
01:06:44,900 --> 01:06:46,890
Even this separation.

1264
01:06:46,890 --> 01:06:50,160
I know you don't believe me,
it's going to do you good

1265
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:52,910
to spend a little time
apart from each other.

1266
01:06:52,910 --> 01:06:55,023
- You don't know what
you're talkin' about.

1267
01:06:56,331 --> 01:06:58,520
- Is the world coming to an end again?

1268
01:06:58,520 --> 01:07:02,600
- No, she's sad to say goodbye
but something else, too.

1269
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:04,657
- Eh, don't worry. Give her
a couple of days in Annapolis

1270
01:07:04,657 --> 01:07:07,388
and everything will be fine, you watch.

1271
01:07:07,388 --> 01:07:10,700
(dramatic drum music)

1272
01:07:10,700 --> 01:07:14,433
- I know you've shown promise
or you wouldn't be here,

1273
01:07:15,980 --> 01:07:18,280
but if any one of you
thinks that the honor code

1274
01:07:18,280 --> 01:07:20,423
does not apply to him or her,

1275
01:07:21,988 --> 01:07:24,430
then let me save you some heartache.

1276
01:07:24,430 --> 01:07:26,010
Leave now.

1277
01:07:26,010 --> 01:07:28,030
Get up and walk away.

1278
01:07:28,030 --> 01:07:29,363
You won't like it here.

1279
01:07:30,690 --> 01:07:33,981
And frankly, we don't want you here.

1280
01:07:33,981 --> 01:07:35,497
- [Officer] Hey, that's roughing.

1281
01:07:35,497 --> 01:07:36,330
Move, move.

1282
01:07:36,330 --> 01:07:38,220
- [Commander] That's right, we
take the honor code seriously

1283
01:07:38,220 --> 01:07:40,840
and I tell you this
from my own experience.

1284
01:07:40,840 --> 01:07:42,310
If you have no honor,

1285
01:07:42,310 --> 01:07:43,930
- [Officer] Let's go, let's go!

1286
01:07:43,930 --> 01:07:45,123
- [Commander] you have nothing.

1287
01:07:46,368 --> 01:07:49,900
You will abide by the code
while you are at Annapolis.

1288
01:07:49,900 --> 01:07:53,953
You will abide by the code as
long as you wear the uniform.

1289
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:57,940
It takes a very special individual

1290
01:07:57,940 --> 01:08:01,060
to wear the uniform of a naval officer.

1291
01:08:01,060 --> 01:08:05,290
And if you are such a
person, we welcome you.

1292
01:08:05,290 --> 01:08:08,593
If not, you will surely come to ruin.

1293
01:08:10,930 --> 01:08:13,343
You can be declared
officers by act of Congress,

1294
01:08:15,261 --> 01:08:18,927
but honor can only come from within.

1295
01:08:20,040 --> 01:08:23,290
(somber trumpet music)

1296
01:08:37,980 --> 01:08:41,066
(button clattering)

1297
01:08:41,066 --> 01:08:44,649
(Diane breathing raggedly)

1298
01:08:51,075 --> 01:08:52,340
- I just had to tell somebody.

1299
01:08:52,340 --> 01:08:53,640
If David were here--

1300
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:56,143
- I understand, I guess.

1301
01:08:57,070 --> 01:08:59,450
- I couldn't live with such
a terrible secret anymore,

1302
01:08:59,450 --> 01:09:00,283
I'm so sorry.

1303
01:09:06,740 --> 01:09:08,113
- Look, don't worry, Diane.

1304
01:09:08,113 --> 01:09:09,513
I won't tell anyone.

1305
01:09:10,750 --> 01:09:12,223
Your secret's safe with me.

1306
01:09:13,850 --> 01:09:15,600
- [David] Diane's
beautiful eyes have always

1307
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:17,800
played the strings of
my heart effortlessly.

1308
01:09:19,090 --> 01:09:21,753
I couldn't imagine life without her.

1309
01:09:22,720 --> 01:09:24,623
Not for a second did I wanna lose her.

1310
01:09:25,500 --> 01:09:28,280
- Yeah, well, my boyfriend's
goin' to Boston University.

1311
01:09:28,280 --> 01:09:29,665
- [Gail] That's a good school.

1312
01:09:29,665 --> 01:09:30,600
- Yeah, yeah.

1313
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:32,820
He swore he wouldn't date anybody else,

1314
01:09:32,820 --> 01:09:34,834
but I kinda think he will.

1315
01:09:34,834 --> 01:09:37,970
Oh, he may feel guilty about
it, but he'll go out, I'm sure.

1316
01:09:37,970 --> 01:09:40,553
- Why do men find it so
difficult to be faithful?

1317
01:09:41,890 --> 01:09:44,126
- [Diane] David won't be cheatin' on me.

1318
01:09:44,126 --> 01:09:45,385
- Oh sure, why not?

1319
01:09:45,385 --> 01:09:47,362
Because he said so?

1320
01:09:47,362 --> 01:09:50,330
- No, because we have a secret

1321
01:09:50,330 --> 01:09:52,560
that we have to take to the grave.

1322
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:53,430
- Come on.

1323
01:09:53,430 --> 01:09:55,140
I can't think of anything
that's bad enough

1324
01:09:55,140 --> 01:09:56,720
to make a man keep his hands to himself

1325
01:09:56,720 --> 01:09:58,810
once he's had a couple of beers.

1326
01:09:58,810 --> 01:09:59,643
There was this once--

1327
01:09:59,643 --> 01:10:00,886
- So what is it?

1328
01:10:00,886 --> 01:10:02,830
What happened?

1329
01:10:02,830 --> 01:10:03,780
- [Gail] Yeah, what did he do?

1330
01:10:03,780 --> 01:10:06,023
- [Annette] Yeah, what'd
ya do, kill for each other?

1331
01:10:06,023 --> 01:10:06,856
- Yes.

1332
01:10:08,170 --> 01:10:09,403
- Get outta here.

1333
01:10:10,770 --> 01:10:13,540
- He was unfaithful
with this girl back home

1334
01:10:15,660 --> 01:10:17,883
and I wanted her dead so he did it.

1335
01:10:19,167 --> 01:10:20,053
I saw him do it.

1336
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:24,770
- And she died?

1337
01:10:24,770 --> 01:10:25,670
- [Diane] Oh yeah.

1338
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:28,963
He shot her twice, I was there.

1339
01:10:30,982 --> 01:10:33,565
(somber music)

1340
01:10:53,962 --> 01:10:55,629
- [Officer] Roll in.

1341
01:10:59,484 --> 01:11:00,624
Right, left.

1342
01:11:00,624 --> 01:11:04,264
(soft ominous music)

1343
01:11:04,264 --> 01:11:05,390
- [Carl] State your name, please.

1344
01:11:05,390 --> 01:11:06,970
- Diane Zamora.

1345
01:11:06,970 --> 01:11:08,640
- Okay, Diane, you have been advised

1346
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:10,350
of your legal rights, is that correct?

1347
01:11:10,350 --> 01:11:11,887
Your rights to an attorney and so on?

1348
01:11:11,887 --> 01:11:13,270
- Yes, sir.

1349
01:11:13,270 --> 01:11:14,900
- Now, what can you tell us

1350
01:11:14,900 --> 01:11:16,650
about the murder of Adrianne Jones?

1351
01:11:17,506 --> 01:11:19,733
- (grunts) Nothing, sir.

1352
01:11:20,814 --> 01:11:23,450
- [Officer] Right, left, right.

1353
01:11:23,450 --> 01:11:25,200
- Diane, we came a long way.

1354
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:28,890
We know what you told you
roommates, your fellow cadets.

1355
01:11:28,890 --> 01:11:30,140
- Oh, I'm sorry about that, sir,

1356
01:11:30,140 --> 01:11:33,100
but see, that was just girl talk.

1357
01:11:33,100 --> 01:11:35,290
I was trying to impress my classmates

1358
01:11:35,290 --> 01:11:38,453
and I just, I made some stuff up just,

1359
01:11:38,453 --> 01:11:39,853
well I don't know why.

1360
01:11:40,890 --> 01:11:41,903
- So your statement now is

1361
01:11:41,903 --> 01:11:43,963
that what you told them isn't true.

1362
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:46,500
- Yes, sir.

1363
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:47,860
- Diane, according to your roommates,

1364
01:11:47,860 --> 01:11:51,303
your boyfriend David shot Adrianne twice.

1365
01:11:51,303 --> 01:11:52,433
- That's not true.

1366
01:11:53,450 --> 01:11:55,230
- [Carl] And you have no idea who did.

1367
01:11:55,230 --> 01:11:56,173
- No, sir.

1368
01:11:57,030 --> 01:12:01,053
- Diane, if you're hiding
something, anything,

1369
01:12:01,921 --> 01:12:05,980
the only way you can help
yourself out is to talk to us.

1370
01:12:05,980 --> 01:12:09,120
- Sir, I was very foolish
to say the things I did,

1371
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:11,620
but it wasn't true, none of it.

1372
01:12:11,620 --> 01:12:14,740
I knew about the Jones girl getting killed

1373
01:12:14,740 --> 01:12:17,210
and everything so naturally
that's what came into my mind,

1374
01:12:17,210 --> 01:12:20,263
but it was just talk, honest.

1375
01:12:22,040 --> 01:12:23,520
- It's just for a few
days until this business

1376
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:25,620
gets cleared up.
- He on the field right now?

1377
01:12:25,620 --> 01:12:27,137
- Yes, sir.
- I believe so, yes.

1378
01:12:27,137 --> 01:12:27,970
- Here are your orders.

1379
01:12:27,970 --> 01:12:30,450
You go home to Texas and you
rest up after plebe summer.

1380
01:12:30,450 --> 01:12:31,870
Think of it as a furlough.

1381
01:12:31,870 --> 01:12:32,703
- Yes, sir.

1382
01:12:32,703 --> 01:12:33,770
- Very well.

1383
01:12:33,770 --> 01:12:35,760
The duty van'll give you
a lift to the airport.

1384
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:37,764
That's all, Zamora, dismissed.

1385
01:12:37,764 --> 01:12:38,597
- Aye aye, sir.

1386
01:12:40,433 --> 01:12:43,209
- [Officer] You've got
about another 18 minutes.

1387
01:12:43,209 --> 01:12:45,792
(somber music)

1388
01:12:47,930 --> 01:12:50,670
- What is the first name that
Adrianne's mother gave us?

1389
01:12:50,670 --> 01:12:52,300
David from cross country.

1390
01:12:52,300 --> 01:12:54,260
- Yeah, but he's not the type.

1391
01:12:54,260 --> 01:12:55,300
We both said so.

1392
01:12:55,300 --> 01:12:56,473
- What is the type?

1393
01:12:58,930 --> 01:13:01,850
- (sighs) We dropped the ball on this.

1394
01:13:01,850 --> 01:13:03,110
- He's a recruiting poster,

1395
01:13:03,110 --> 01:13:04,810
so I don't put him on a polygraph.

1396
01:13:04,810 --> 01:13:06,029
- Let's go do that.

1397
01:13:06,029 --> 01:13:07,650
- No, first we go back to Manning.

1398
01:13:07,650 --> 01:13:09,690
There's gotta be somebody
that knows somethin'

1399
01:13:09,690 --> 01:13:10,660
about those two.

1400
01:13:10,660 --> 01:13:12,086
- [Announcer] At this time, we'd like to

1401
01:13:12,086 --> 01:13:15,230
Flight 151 to Birmingham non-stop.

1402
01:13:15,230 --> 01:13:16,063
Please advise our
- Hi.

1403
01:13:16,063 --> 01:13:17,902
- first class passengers,
- What can I do for you

1404
01:13:17,902 --> 01:13:19,524
- platinum circle members,
- Midshipman Zamora?

1405
01:13:19,524 --> 01:13:20,357
- and passengers--
- Well, I have

1406
01:13:20,357 --> 01:13:21,330
these travel orders.

1407
01:13:21,330 --> 01:13:22,700
- All right.

1408
01:13:22,700 --> 01:13:25,130
Looks like that's gonna take
you into Dallas-Fort Worth

1409
01:13:25,130 --> 01:13:26,500
and the next flight is--

1410
01:13:26,500 --> 01:13:28,920
- Yeah, I know, I need
to make a stop first

1411
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:30,760
in Colorado Springs.

1412
01:13:30,760 --> 01:13:31,912
- [Clerk] Colorado Springs?

1413
01:13:31,912 --> 01:13:32,745
- [Diane] Mm-hm.

1414
01:13:32,745 --> 01:13:34,370
- That's Air Force country, isn't it?

1415
01:13:34,370 --> 01:13:36,910
- Yeah, my fiance's at the academy.

1416
01:13:36,910 --> 01:13:39,774
- Thought the Air Force and
the Navy were big rivals.

1417
01:13:39,774 --> 01:13:43,090
- Well, I plan to transfer my
commission after I graduate.

1418
01:13:43,090 --> 01:13:44,473
We're both gonna be fliers.

1419
01:13:45,374 --> 01:13:47,480
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

1420
01:13:47,480 --> 01:13:48,540
- Well, in that case,

1421
01:13:48,540 --> 01:13:50,413
let's see if we can't find you a plane.

1422
01:13:51,270 --> 01:13:52,103
- Great.

1423
01:13:52,103 --> 01:13:54,440
Could you just tell him
that Diane will be there

1424
01:13:54,440 --> 01:13:56,840
as planned, the plane's leavin' on time?

1425
01:13:56,840 --> 01:13:59,063
And one more thing,

1426
01:14:00,030 --> 01:14:03,793
just put greenish brown female sheep.

1427
01:14:04,750 --> 01:14:06,320
That's right.

1428
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:08,803
Now he'll know what it means.

1429
01:14:08,803 --> 01:14:10,103
Okay, thank you very much.

1430
01:14:12,180 --> 01:14:13,856
- Yeah, but did they believe you?

1431
01:14:13,856 --> 01:14:16,200
- I don't know, that's not the point.

1432
01:14:16,200 --> 01:14:17,972
I was very firm about it.

1433
01:14:17,972 --> 01:14:19,383
- You know what, they're just gonna

1434
01:14:19,383 --> 01:14:22,124
keep comin' at us from now on.

1435
01:14:22,124 --> 01:14:24,270
(Diane sighs)

1436
01:14:24,270 --> 01:14:25,950
- Well, if they had any hard evidence,

1437
01:14:25,950 --> 01:14:27,790
they would've brought it with them, right?

1438
01:14:27,790 --> 01:14:28,750
- I don't know, that's what they do.

1439
01:14:28,750 --> 01:14:31,571
They just keep comin' on and on.

1440
01:14:31,571 --> 01:14:34,673
(soft ominous music)

1441
01:14:34,673 --> 01:14:37,120
- [Diane] Look, the important thing

1442
01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:38,763
is for us to stick together.

1443
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:42,947
- Yeah, you're right.

1444
01:14:42,947 --> 01:14:45,223
- United we stand,
that's what you told me.

1445
01:14:46,823 --> 01:14:48,683
- God, I missed you so much.

1446
01:14:59,348 --> 01:15:00,700
(camera clicks)

1447
01:15:00,700 --> 01:15:02,619
- [Photographer] One
minute, I'll be right back.

1448
01:15:02,619 --> 01:15:03,452
- Okay.

1449
01:15:05,394 --> 01:15:06,760
- The thing that bothers
me is that I never thought

1450
01:15:06,760 --> 01:15:09,380
they'd run out and tell on me
without talking to me first.

1451
01:15:09,380 --> 01:15:11,270
I mean, what kind of honor code is that?

1452
01:15:11,270 --> 01:15:13,160
- They should have as fellow officers--

1453
01:15:13,160 --> 01:15:15,550
- As fellow officers,
they had the obligation

1454
01:15:15,550 --> 01:15:17,470
to confront me with
their suspicions first.

1455
01:15:17,470 --> 01:15:18,720
- That's right, they did.

1456
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:22,010
- They're the ones that
broke the code, not me.

1457
01:15:22,010 --> 01:15:23,973
- You're right, they
shoulda come to you first.

1458
01:15:25,912 --> 01:15:27,262
- Just put this behind you.

1459
01:15:30,259 --> 01:15:32,210
- I didn't know what to do.

1460
01:15:32,210 --> 01:15:33,992
Nobody's ever asked me
about this until now.

1461
01:15:33,992 --> 01:15:35,683
- What time was it?

1462
01:15:37,437 --> 01:15:39,923
- I don't even know, I was asleep.

1463
01:15:40,780 --> 01:15:42,320
- Okay, so you were asleep.

1464
01:15:42,320 --> 01:15:44,200
What made you wake up?

1465
01:15:44,200 --> 01:15:46,290
- Well,
(knuckles tapping)

1466
01:15:46,290 --> 01:15:47,490
he knocked on my window.

1467
01:15:49,536 --> 01:15:51,066
- I need to come in for a minute,

1468
01:15:51,066 --> 01:15:52,483
all right?
- Okay.

1469
01:15:56,307 --> 01:15:59,498
(Diane gasps)

1470
01:15:59,498 --> 01:16:00,780
- [Ben] I thought they must've been

1471
01:16:00,780 --> 01:16:02,647
in a car wreck or something.

1472
01:16:04,130 --> 01:16:05,880
- Listen to me, you're my
best friend, all right?

1473
01:16:05,880 --> 01:16:06,713
This never happened.

1474
01:16:06,713 --> 01:16:07,720
We were never here tonight.

1475
01:16:07,720 --> 01:16:09,110
We never came in that window, understand?

1476
01:16:09,110 --> 01:16:10,550
- Okay.
- Okay, good.

1477
01:16:10,550 --> 01:16:11,520
- You guys all right?
- Listen,

1478
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:12,938
don't ask any questions.

1479
01:16:12,938 --> 01:16:15,368
You are my friend, this never happened.

1480
01:16:15,368 --> 01:16:16,576
Okay, okay?
- I'm not gonna question ya.

1481
01:16:16,576 --> 01:16:18,583
If you need a place to stay,
you got one right here,

1482
01:16:18,583 --> 01:16:19,833
you know that.

1483
01:16:22,047 --> 01:16:24,630
(Diane crying)

1484
01:16:30,686 --> 01:16:32,209
- What happened next?

1485
01:16:32,209 --> 01:16:33,480
- Well, I let 'em in.

1486
01:16:33,480 --> 01:16:35,037
David wanted some clothes.
- On the left!

1487
01:16:35,037 --> 01:16:36,218
- If you need a place to stay,

1488
01:16:36,218 --> 01:16:39,180
you know you got one right
here, man, you know that.

1489
01:16:39,180 --> 01:16:41,253
- We need to borrow some clothes, okay?

1490
01:16:54,878 --> 01:16:59,853
Oh, I'm gonna be sick. (coughing)

1491
01:17:12,290 --> 01:17:13,123
Oh God.

1492
01:17:25,516 --> 01:17:27,100
(camera clicks)

1493
01:17:27,100 --> 01:17:28,903
- [Photographer] Hang on, one second.

1494
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:32,730
- They're gonna come at you
with everything they have now.

1495
01:17:32,730 --> 01:17:33,973
- Don't worry about me.

1496
01:17:34,850 --> 01:17:35,750
- I'm not worried.

1497
01:17:36,650 --> 01:17:38,950
You're the most disciplined
man I've ever met.

1498
01:17:39,997 --> 01:17:41,577
God, I love you.

1499
01:17:41,577 --> 01:17:43,869
- I love you so much.

1500
01:17:43,869 --> 01:17:45,623
- And I always will no matter what.

1501
01:17:48,500 --> 01:17:49,590
- [Tom] What happened
to the other clothes,

1502
01:17:49,590 --> 01:17:50,837
the ones they took off?

1503
01:17:52,111 --> 01:17:53,805
- I don't know.

1504
01:17:53,805 --> 01:17:54,810
I don't know.

1505
01:17:54,810 --> 01:17:58,460
They took 'em with 'em I guess.

1506
01:17:58,460 --> 01:18:00,310
I looked in on 'em at one point

1507
01:18:01,176 --> 01:18:04,643
because I heard 'em, like, crying.

1508
01:18:09,540 --> 01:18:11,520
I left 'em alone and then
when I went back later

1509
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:12,770
they were gone.

1510
01:18:12,770 --> 01:18:14,930
And I did talk to David
a couple days later

1511
01:18:14,930 --> 01:18:18,140
and he said that I shouldn't say anything

1512
01:18:18,140 --> 01:18:20,350
to anybody ever and he wouldn't tell me

1513
01:18:20,350 --> 01:18:21,250
what happened, so.

1514
01:18:22,527 --> 01:18:23,360
I don't know.

1515
01:18:25,294 --> 01:18:28,620
(camera clicks)

1516
01:18:28,620 --> 01:18:30,290
- We'll get through this, won't we?

1517
01:18:30,290 --> 01:18:33,170
- Of course we will and
we'll be together forever.

1518
01:18:34,133 --> 01:18:35,716
- Forever and ever.

1519
01:18:41,400 --> 01:18:42,233
- That's nice.

1520
01:18:43,721 --> 01:18:46,388
(camera clicks)

1521
01:18:49,766 --> 01:18:52,433
(ominous music)

1522
01:18:57,159 --> 01:19:00,390
- You said that before,
but you were the only David

1523
01:19:00,390 --> 01:19:02,400
on the cross country team, weren't ya?

1524
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:05,150
- Sir, I never said I didn't know A.J.,

1525
01:19:05,150 --> 01:19:06,250
but I didn't kill her.

1526
01:19:09,100 --> 01:19:10,020
- Says he didn't kill her.

1527
01:19:10,020 --> 01:19:11,003
- Mm-hm.

1528
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:15,950
Personally, I believe you, David.

1529
01:19:15,950 --> 01:19:17,180
Why don't you let us give you a polygraph,

1530
01:19:17,180 --> 01:19:18,780
we can wrap this whole thing up.

1531
01:19:20,130 --> 01:19:21,330
- Polygraph?

1532
01:19:21,330 --> 01:19:23,800
- You don't have to, but
it would help us out.

1533
01:19:23,800 --> 01:19:26,400
We can eliminate you
as a suspect, move on,

1534
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:29,196
focus on the next name
on the list, ya know?

1535
01:19:29,196 --> 01:19:30,029
- I don't know.

1536
01:19:34,370 --> 01:19:37,593
- Does the Air Force have
any objection to a polygraph?

1537
01:19:38,770 --> 01:19:40,673
- No, no objections.

1538
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:42,433
Graham?

1539
01:19:48,890 --> 01:19:50,513
- Sir, I have no objections.

1540
01:19:52,470 --> 01:19:54,143
- Good, that's good.

1541
01:19:56,880 --> 01:19:58,330
- [Interviewer] Were you
having a relationship

1542
01:19:58,330 --> 01:19:59,683
with Adrianna Jones?

1543
01:20:00,740 --> 01:20:01,573
- [David] No.

1544
01:20:02,450 --> 01:20:04,650
- [Interviewer] Did you
kill Adrianna Jones?

1545
01:20:06,667 --> 01:20:07,500
- No.

1546
01:20:13,520 --> 01:20:16,260
- David, I want you to listen to me.

1547
01:20:16,260 --> 01:20:19,626
We know you did it, the
machine told us that.

1548
01:20:19,626 --> 01:20:20,459
- What?

1549
01:20:21,560 --> 01:20:22,473
What do you mean?

1550
01:20:23,313 --> 01:20:24,770
What did it say?

1551
01:20:24,770 --> 01:20:25,723
- We know you killed Adrianne.

1552
01:20:25,723 --> 01:20:27,410
- It's not just the polygraph.

1553
01:20:27,410 --> 01:20:29,570
We talked to your friend
Ben about that night.

1554
01:20:29,570 --> 01:20:30,810
He gave you up.

1555
01:20:30,810 --> 01:20:32,680
- He told us about the
knock on the window,

1556
01:20:32,680 --> 01:20:35,200
the bloody clothes, you getting sick,

1557
01:20:35,200 --> 01:20:37,980
you and Diane lying down
together and crying.

1558
01:20:37,980 --> 01:20:39,280
He told us everything, David.

1559
01:20:39,280 --> 01:20:40,830
- [Tom] We know it was you.

1560
01:20:40,830 --> 01:20:43,040
- It's your duty to tell the truth, David.

1561
01:20:43,040 --> 01:20:44,190
It's a matter of honor.

1562
01:20:59,839 --> 01:21:00,672
- I,

1563
01:21:02,850 --> 01:21:03,683
I did it.

1564
01:21:07,550 --> 01:21:08,383
- That's better.

1565
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:12,010
Just start with that.

1566
01:21:13,130 --> 01:21:14,620
Make a chronology.

1567
01:21:14,620 --> 01:21:17,053
Tell us what happened when, in what order.

1568
01:21:18,320 --> 01:21:19,300
You're gonna feel a lot better

1569
01:21:19,300 --> 01:21:21,373
when this is over, believe me.

1570
01:21:22,458 --> 01:21:24,360
- If ya have a typewriter
it'll make things

1571
01:21:24,360 --> 01:21:26,053
move faster for both of us.

1572
01:21:27,440 --> 01:21:29,093
- Okay, I'll get ya what you need.

1573
01:21:31,218 --> 01:21:32,500
(computer keys clicking)

1574
01:21:32,500 --> 01:21:34,020
- Diane's beautiful eyes have always

1575
01:21:34,020 --> 01:21:36,220
played the strings of
my heart effortlessly.

1576
01:21:37,430 --> 01:21:39,230
I couldn't imagine life without her.

1577
01:21:40,320 --> 01:21:42,403
Not for a second did I wanna lose her.

1578
01:21:43,270 --> 01:21:46,690
I thought long and hard about
how to carry out the crime.

1579
01:21:46,690 --> 01:21:49,973
I was stupid, but I was in love.

1580
01:21:54,670 --> 01:21:57,063
Some of the plan worked, some did not.

1581
01:21:58,760 --> 01:22:00,590
The plan was to call
Adrianne and convince her

1582
01:22:00,590 --> 01:22:01,923
to come out to my car.

1583
01:22:02,830 --> 01:22:03,683
That worked.

1584
01:22:05,160 --> 01:22:07,190
A.J. it's me, David Graham.

1585
01:22:07,190 --> 01:22:10,420
Hey, look, I have to talk to you.

1586
01:22:10,420 --> 01:22:11,633
Can I see you?

1587
01:22:13,070 --> 01:22:14,040
Can you get outta your house

1588
01:22:14,040 --> 01:22:15,790
for a few minutes later on tonight?

1589
01:22:17,470 --> 01:22:19,870
Please, A.J., this is
real important, all right?

1590
01:22:21,690 --> 01:22:22,523
Who was that?

1591
01:22:23,972 --> 01:22:26,253
So look, can you come tonight?

1592
01:22:27,350 --> 01:22:28,183
Midnight.

1593
01:22:29,330 --> 01:22:32,170
Please, A.J., this is real
important to me, all right?

1594
01:22:32,170 --> 01:22:35,160
I'm all twisted up inside
and I don't know what to do

1595
01:22:35,160 --> 01:22:37,863
and you're the only one
who can help me, all right.

1596
01:22:39,602 --> 01:22:40,623
So you'll be there?

1597
01:22:42,610 --> 01:22:43,443
Great.

1598
01:22:44,420 --> 01:22:45,253
Okay.

1599
01:22:50,252 --> 01:22:53,669
(soft suspenseful music)

1600
01:22:58,831 --> 01:23:02,260
The plan was to drive her
out near Joe Pool Lake.

1601
01:23:02,260 --> 01:23:03,650
That worked.

1602
01:23:03,650 --> 01:23:05,570
- [Adrianne] So where are we goin'?

1603
01:23:05,570 --> 01:23:07,780
- Just up the road a piece.

1604
01:23:07,780 --> 01:23:09,333
I figured we should be alone.

1605
01:23:09,333 --> 01:23:10,620
- I can't go far, though.

1606
01:23:10,620 --> 01:23:12,680
- No, no.

1607
01:23:12,680 --> 01:23:14,630
- My folks caught me
sneakin' out one time before

1608
01:23:14,630 --> 01:23:17,590
and they fixed the screen
so I couldn't get back in.

1609
01:23:17,590 --> 01:23:18,900
- Yeah?

1610
01:23:18,900 --> 01:23:20,870
- Yeah, my daddy nailed
my bedroom window shut

1611
01:23:20,870 --> 01:23:22,070
so I couldn't sneak out.

1612
01:23:27,224 --> 01:23:29,557
So what's goin' on with you?

1613
01:23:38,532 --> 01:23:42,650
- The plan was to,
(computer keys clicking)

1614
01:23:42,650 --> 01:23:44,573
this is not easy for me to confess,

1615
01:23:47,160 --> 01:23:50,130
break her young neck and sink
her to the bottom of the lake

1616
01:23:50,130 --> 01:23:52,880
with the weights that ended
up being hit into her head.

1617
01:23:56,100 --> 01:23:57,170
That didn't work.

1618
01:23:58,528 --> 01:24:01,611
(soft ominous music)

1619
01:24:21,683 --> 01:24:23,016
- So what is it?

1620
01:24:25,810 --> 01:24:26,810
- Come here.

1621
01:24:28,027 --> 01:24:28,885
- What?

1622
01:24:28,885 --> 01:24:30,235
- Just come here.

1623
01:24:30,235 --> 01:24:31,088
(Adrianne cries out)

1624
01:24:31,088 --> 01:24:31,967
Come here.

1625
01:24:31,967 --> 01:24:33,008
- [Adrianne] What are you doing?

1626
01:24:33,008 --> 01:24:33,957
- Stop!

1627
01:24:33,957 --> 01:24:35,482
- Let go of me.
- Stop.

1628
01:24:35,482 --> 01:24:36,448
- What are you doing?

1629
01:24:36,448 --> 01:24:37,619
Let go!

1630
01:24:37,619 --> 01:24:39,829
What is wrong with you?

1631
01:24:39,829 --> 01:24:40,825
Let go of me.

1632
01:24:40,825 --> 01:24:42,498
- Diane, help me hold her.

1633
01:24:42,498 --> 01:24:44,784
- Oh my God.
- Diane, help me.

1634
01:24:44,784 --> 01:24:46,396
(Adrianne cries out)

1635
01:24:46,396 --> 01:24:47,729
You hold her.

1636
01:24:47,729 --> 01:24:49,126
- [Adrianne] What are you doing?

1637
01:24:49,126 --> 01:24:50,626
- [David] Get her!

1638
01:24:51,475 --> 01:24:53,654
(Adrianne screaming)

1639
01:24:53,654 --> 01:24:55,688
- [Adrianne] Get away now!

1640
01:24:55,688 --> 01:24:56,560
- [David] Come on.

1641
01:24:56,560 --> 01:24:58,063
I can't get her neck.

1642
01:25:00,401 --> 01:25:03,143
We realized that it was either her or us.

1643
01:25:04,140 --> 01:25:05,700
Diane struck her in the back of the head

1644
01:25:05,700 --> 01:25:07,807
with one of the weights while I held her.

1645
01:25:09,729 --> 01:25:10,646
- Remember.

1646
01:25:11,677 --> 01:25:16,677
(skull crunching)
(David grunts)

1647
01:25:18,709 --> 01:25:21,709
(Adrianne whimpers)

1648
01:25:22,931 --> 01:25:25,720
- [Adrianne] Get off me. (crying)

1649
01:25:25,720 --> 01:25:27,919
Oh my God. (whimpering)

1650
01:25:27,919 --> 01:25:29,676
- [David] Come on, hold her.

1651
01:25:29,676 --> 01:25:31,904
- Come on.
- Let me go.

1652
01:25:31,904 --> 01:25:32,737
Help me.

1653
01:25:34,898 --> 01:25:35,731
Let me go.

1654
01:25:37,376 --> 01:25:42,376
Let me go. (whimpering)

1655
01:25:46,159 --> 01:25:47,983
- (grunting) You didn't die.

1656
01:25:47,983 --> 01:25:49,403
Never mind.

1657
01:25:49,403 --> 01:25:54,403
(Adrianne whimpering)
(David grunting)

1658
01:25:57,290 --> 01:25:59,110
Adrianne somehow crawled
through the window,

1659
01:25:59,110 --> 01:26:02,353
and to our horror, ran off.

1660
01:26:03,690 --> 01:26:06,193
She ran into a nearby field and collapsed.

1661
01:26:07,310 --> 01:26:10,033
I wanted to just jump in and drive off.

1662
01:26:12,270 --> 01:26:14,530
We were both shaking and even surprised

1663
01:26:14,530 --> 01:26:16,053
by the nature of our actions.

1664
01:26:17,780 --> 01:26:20,230
Neither Diane or myself
were ever violent people.

1665
01:26:26,550 --> 01:26:29,550
(Adrianne grunting)

1666
01:26:46,920 --> 01:26:48,380
I was panicky and just grabbed

1667
01:26:48,380 --> 01:26:50,133
the nine miller Makarov to follow.

1668
01:26:51,990 --> 01:26:54,160
In that short instant I knew

1669
01:26:54,160 --> 01:26:56,760
I wouldn't leave the key
witness to our crime alive.

1670
01:26:57,620 --> 01:26:59,043
It was either her or us.

1671
01:27:06,160 --> 01:27:08,103
So I just pointed and shot.

1672
01:27:20,004 --> 01:27:21,840
(gun fires)

1673
01:27:21,840 --> 01:27:22,673
I fired again

1674
01:27:22,673 --> 01:27:24,730
and ran to the car.
(gun fires)

1675
01:27:24,730 --> 01:27:26,753
I was very confused and scared.

1676
01:27:33,650 --> 01:27:34,650
- [Diane] I love you.

1677
01:27:34,650 --> 01:27:36,030
- I love you.

1678
01:27:36,030 --> 01:27:37,950
- Oh David, we shouldn't have done that.

1679
01:27:37,950 --> 01:27:42,950
- [David] I thought, nice
time to tell me. (chuckles)

1680
01:28:06,530 --> 01:28:08,480
I just wanted it to be a dream.

1681
01:28:08,480 --> 01:28:11,210
I wanted to be able to
drive Adrianne back home,

1682
01:28:11,210 --> 01:28:14,623
go to sleep, and wake
up back on December 3rd,

1683
01:28:15,620 --> 01:28:17,670
free to make my decisions all over again.

1684
01:28:20,270 --> 01:28:22,570
Diane was constantly
depressed from the guilt.

1685
01:28:23,910 --> 01:28:25,803
She was also scared I'd be arrested.

1686
01:28:27,770 --> 01:28:28,960
Really didn't matter, however,

1687
01:28:28,960 --> 01:28:30,933
what any police or detectives found.

1688
01:28:32,190 --> 01:28:34,190
What happened was over.

1689
01:28:34,190 --> 01:28:37,133
Adrianne was gone and I was responsible.

1690
01:28:38,132 --> 01:28:39,733
And it wasn't going away.

1691
01:28:46,574 --> 01:28:48,697
(computer beeps)

1692
01:28:48,697 --> 01:28:51,614
(printer clacking)

1693
01:28:56,880 --> 01:28:58,460
- Where's the gun, David?

1694
01:28:58,460 --> 01:28:59,293
- My house.

1695
01:29:00,850 --> 01:29:03,000
I wrapped it in a shirt
and I hid it there.

1696
01:29:04,571 --> 01:29:05,813
- Need you to sign this.

1697
01:29:08,384 --> 01:29:10,310
I'll get moving on a warrant.

1698
01:29:13,757 --> 01:29:15,590
- [Carl] Okay, David, we're goin' nextdoor

1699
01:29:15,590 --> 01:29:16,690
so let's put these on.

1700
01:29:19,082 --> 01:29:20,600
- Those are for me?

1701
01:29:20,600 --> 01:29:21,644
- Yes, they are.

1702
01:29:21,644 --> 01:29:24,727
(handcuffs clicking)

1703
01:29:27,375 --> 01:29:29,708
Ya did kill a girl, ya know.

1704
01:29:32,320 --> 01:29:34,640
- They're bringing your
boyfriend down from Colorado.

1705
01:29:34,640 --> 01:29:36,410
He'll be on a different
floor, but I could probably

1706
01:29:36,410 --> 01:29:37,670
get a message to him.

1707
01:29:37,670 --> 01:29:39,320
Anything you want me to tell him?

1708
01:29:40,546 --> 01:29:43,693
- Just tell him greenish
brown female sheep.

1709
01:29:44,680 --> 01:29:45,910
- What's that all about?

1710
01:29:45,910 --> 01:29:47,530
- It's our code.

1711
01:29:47,530 --> 01:29:50,990
Greenish brown is olive
and female sheep is a ewe.

1712
01:29:50,990 --> 01:29:52,290
Olive ewe.

1713
01:29:52,290 --> 01:29:54,060
- [Guard] Olive ewe?

1714
01:29:54,060 --> 01:29:54,893
- I love you.

1715
01:29:59,836 --> 01:30:02,919
(reporters shouting)

1716
01:30:08,086 --> 01:30:11,445
(siren beeping)

1717
01:30:11,445 --> 01:30:12,641
- [Officer] Come on, ma'am.

1718
01:30:12,641 --> 01:30:14,216
(officers chattering)

1719
01:30:14,216 --> 01:30:16,049
- [Officer] Stay back.

1720
01:30:17,353 --> 01:30:18,783
- [Officer] Back it up, back it up.

1721
01:30:18,783 --> 01:30:21,670
(reporters and officers chattering)

1722
01:30:21,670 --> 01:30:22,910
- No questions, please, there'll be

1723
01:30:22,910 --> 01:30:25,010
official statement later day.

1724
01:30:25,010 --> 01:30:26,674
- Yes, sir.
- David, David!

1725
01:30:26,674 --> 01:30:27,570
- Later.
- David!

1726
01:30:27,570 --> 01:30:29,460
- [Reporter] Hey, David.

1727
01:30:29,460 --> 01:30:32,410
David, is there anything
you'd like to say to Diane?

1728
01:30:32,410 --> 01:30:34,294
- I love you.
- Back up.

1729
01:30:34,294 --> 01:30:35,576
Back it up.

1730
01:30:35,576 --> 01:30:37,472
Sir, back up.
- Made you crack?

1731
01:30:37,472 --> 01:30:38,403
(camera clicks)

1732
01:30:38,403 --> 01:30:41,070
(ominous music)

1733
01:31:27,694 --> 01:31:30,361
(Linda sobbing)

1734
01:31:48,988 --> 01:31:52,488
(somber orchestral music)

1735
01:33:21,323 --> 01:33:24,156
(Multicom Jingle)
