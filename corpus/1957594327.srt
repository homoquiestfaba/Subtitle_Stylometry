1
00:00:05,643 --> 00:00:08,226
(spooky music)

2
00:00:37,621 --> 00:00:39,469
(thunder rumbles)

3
00:00:39,469 --> 00:00:40,843
- [Scott] Nice place.

4
00:00:40,843 --> 00:00:44,104
- [Marie] Nice place for an
Amityville Horror squeal anyway.

5
00:00:44,104 --> 00:00:46,033
You know I can't believe I
actually let you drag me out

6
00:00:46,033 --> 00:00:47,336
to this house.

7
00:00:47,336 --> 00:00:48,612
- [Scott] Yeah?

8
00:00:48,612 --> 00:00:50,424
What else would you have done tonight?

9
00:00:50,424 --> 00:00:52,739
- [Marie] Maybe I would
have read a good book.

10
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:53,910
Who knows?

11
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:56,260
I actually would have
rather gone to a bar.

12
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:59,528
(car doors open and close)

13
00:00:59,528 --> 00:01:01,098
- [Scott] Looks like we're
the first to show up.

14
00:01:01,098 --> 00:01:02,743
- [Marie] Well I don't like this too much.

15
00:01:02,743 --> 00:01:04,135
- I think you're being silly.

16
00:01:04,135 --> 00:01:06,906
I mean look at this, this
is going to be a blast.

17
00:01:06,906 --> 00:01:08,739
Partying down at the old haunted house.

18
00:01:08,739 --> 00:01:09,572
- Yippee.

19
00:01:11,208 --> 00:01:12,838
- What were you talking
about earlier today?

20
00:01:12,838 --> 00:01:15,425
Something about Elizabeth?

21
00:01:15,425 --> 00:01:17,629
- Well I was in grade school with her.

22
00:01:17,629 --> 00:01:18,954
I don't remember her too well back then,

23
00:01:18,954 --> 00:01:22,535
except the fact that
she was really spooky.

24
00:01:22,535 --> 00:01:24,972
- Well she sure ain't like that anymore.

25
00:01:24,972 --> 00:01:26,889
- I give you exhibit A.

26
00:01:27,725 --> 00:01:28,955
Witch house.

27
00:01:28,955 --> 00:01:31,455
(scary music)

28
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:45,477
(doorbell rings)

29
00:01:53,996 --> 00:01:55,389
I told you.

30
00:01:55,389 --> 00:01:56,389
Nobody home.

31
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:04,156
(door creaks open)

32
00:02:05,154 --> 00:02:06,737
- Let's go in, huh?

33
00:02:08,321 --> 00:02:09,786
- And what if Elizabeth gets pissed off

34
00:02:09,786 --> 00:02:11,483
because we walked into her house?

35
00:02:11,483 --> 00:02:13,344
- Maybe she'll turn us into frogs.

36
00:02:13,344 --> 00:02:14,660
- Funny, asshole.

37
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:15,669
- How the hell should I know.

38
00:02:15,669 --> 00:02:17,866
Let's just go in.

39
00:02:17,866 --> 00:02:20,616
(dramatic music)

40
00:02:23,081 --> 00:02:25,831
(thunder cracks)

41
00:02:26,907 --> 00:02:29,574
(clock ticking)

42
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,517
(door creaks open)

43
00:02:37,592 --> 00:02:38,824
(whistles)

44
00:02:38,824 --> 00:02:40,163
- Wow.

45
00:02:40,163 --> 00:02:42,163
She really went all out.

46
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:47,217
- How do you know this isn't
the way her place always looks?

47
00:02:48,073 --> 00:02:50,139
Remember that promise?

48
00:02:50,139 --> 00:02:52,465
That we'd go to the Hurricane
if this turned out bad?

49
00:02:52,465 --> 00:02:54,555
- Honey we'll go in a sec, okay?

50
00:02:54,555 --> 00:02:56,393
(thunder cracks)

51
00:02:56,393 --> 00:02:57,226
Elizabeth?

52
00:02:58,914 --> 00:02:59,747
Lizzy?

53
00:03:01,024 --> 00:03:04,233
It's Bob and Margaret,
we're here for the party?

54
00:03:04,233 --> 00:03:05,847
Maybe she's shy?

55
00:03:05,847 --> 00:03:08,400
- Maybe it's an early April Fools gag.

56
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,610
We show up and no party.

57
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:11,812
Ha ha.

58
00:03:11,812 --> 00:03:13,927
Well we really look stupid.

59
00:03:13,927 --> 00:03:15,513
Let's split.

60
00:03:15,513 --> 00:03:17,337
- Hold on, there's a
light coming for here.

61
00:03:17,337 --> 00:03:18,920
Let's check it out.

62
00:03:23,644 --> 00:03:25,010
(door closes)

63
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:28,177
(clock chimes deeply)

64
00:03:30,707 --> 00:03:31,540
- Bob?

65
00:03:35,095 --> 00:03:35,928
Bob?

66
00:03:35,928 --> 00:03:37,562
- Yes mama.

67
00:03:37,562 --> 00:03:39,065
- You idiot.

68
00:03:39,065 --> 00:03:40,585
- You should have seen your face.

69
00:03:40,585 --> 00:03:41,903
- Well take a good look dick head,

70
00:03:41,903 --> 00:03:44,403
because I'm about to claw your eyes out.

71
00:03:44,403 --> 00:03:46,475
- I wasn't trying to scare you, okay?

72
00:03:46,475 --> 00:03:48,252
Ronnie, you got to
check this basement out.

73
00:03:48,252 --> 00:03:49,085
It's wild.

74
00:03:50,448 --> 00:03:53,031
- Okay, let's see the basement.

75
00:03:53,893 --> 00:03:56,643
(thunder cracks)

76
00:03:58,123 --> 00:04:01,257
(water drips)

77
00:04:01,257 --> 00:04:03,840
(spooky music)

78
00:04:09,322 --> 00:04:10,609
- I really hope this is just more

79
00:04:10,609 --> 00:04:12,671
of Elizabeth's party favors.

80
00:04:12,671 --> 00:04:14,449
Because if it isn't,

81
00:04:14,449 --> 00:04:17,640
she's got some serious
problems to deal with.

82
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,473
- Honey,

83
00:04:19,422 --> 00:04:20,416
remember when I told you

84
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:22,309
I always wanted to do it in a graveyard?

85
00:04:22,309 --> 00:04:26,364
- And remember when I called
you a sick freak when you did.

86
00:04:26,364 --> 00:04:29,364
- Well, we could do it here instead.

87
00:04:30,303 --> 00:04:31,602
- Bob.

88
00:04:31,602 --> 00:04:34,724
What if Elizabeth or
somebody else finds us?

89
00:04:34,724 --> 00:04:35,636
Are you insane?

90
00:04:35,636 --> 00:04:37,189
- No.

91
00:04:37,189 --> 00:04:38,022
Just very,

92
00:04:39,025 --> 00:04:40,408
very horny.

93
00:04:40,408 --> 00:04:43,161
- Okay, you big goofball.

94
00:04:43,161 --> 00:04:45,578
But you owe me if we do this.

95
00:04:48,095 --> 00:04:50,431
- I'll take you to the new Meg Ryan movie.

96
00:04:50,431 --> 00:04:52,514
I know you like Meg Ryan.

97
00:04:53,547 --> 00:04:56,297
(dramatic music)

98
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,906
- Shit.

99
00:05:21,906 --> 00:05:24,211
I knew somebody was going to find us.

100
00:05:24,211 --> 00:05:25,211
- Elizabeth?

101
00:05:28,812 --> 00:05:29,729
Nice trick.

102
00:05:31,116 --> 00:05:31,949
(yells out)

103
00:05:31,949 --> 00:05:32,949
- Oh my God.

104
00:05:34,112 --> 00:05:34,945
Bob!

105
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:41,077
(body thuds to floor)

106
00:05:44,084 --> 00:05:46,190
(spooky music)

107
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:47,154
(thunder cracks)

108
00:05:47,154 --> 00:05:49,321
(screams)

109
00:05:51,177 --> 00:05:53,927
(dramatic music)

110
00:09:04,355 --> 00:09:05,188
(funky rock music)

111
00:09:05,188 --> 00:09:07,021
- [Marie] I'm excited.

112
00:09:12,934 --> 00:09:16,684
I mean this is totally
gonna be a cool party.

113
00:09:19,109 --> 00:09:21,459
- Oh, remember when Elizabeth
had that fake eye ball

114
00:09:21,459 --> 00:09:23,917
at the formal, and pretended
her eye had fallen out?

115
00:09:23,917 --> 00:09:25,905
God, she's awesome.

116
00:09:25,905 --> 00:09:27,608
- Isn't that the same
year she hid the dead rat

117
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:29,017
in Billy Hershberger's locker,

118
00:09:29,017 --> 00:09:31,472
and they had the police
investigation over it?

119
00:09:31,472 --> 00:09:33,722
- Oh now, that's messed up.

120
00:09:34,599 --> 00:09:36,445
- Do you guys know where
Bob and Margaret are?

121
00:09:36,445 --> 00:09:38,328
Their car's here.

122
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:39,410
- Maken out, I don't know.

123
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:41,573
What am I their baby sitter?

124
00:09:41,573 --> 00:09:43,582
- I just though that it was weird that

125
00:09:43,582 --> 00:09:45,115
you know their car's
outside and we haven't seen

126
00:09:45,115 --> 00:09:47,125
them all night, that's all.

127
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:47,958
- Brad.

128
00:09:50,971 --> 00:09:53,556
You Brainiac, you think too much.

129
00:09:53,556 --> 00:09:54,553
What?

130
00:09:54,553 --> 00:09:57,003
- You pick on him too much Scott, okay?

131
00:09:57,003 --> 00:09:59,352
- Okay boys, make nice.

132
00:09:59,352 --> 00:10:03,209
Jack you can take off
your Superman costume now.

133
00:10:03,209 --> 00:10:06,335
Anyways, Brad's a quantum mechanics major.

134
00:10:06,335 --> 00:10:08,903
He's going to be the next Stephen King.

135
00:10:08,903 --> 00:10:11,623
- That's Stephen Hawking, Marie.

136
00:10:11,623 --> 00:10:14,566
- One more of these and
it'll be Bozo the Clown.

137
00:10:14,566 --> 00:10:17,807
- Meanwhile, Jackie here is
going to be a TV repair man.

138
00:10:17,807 --> 00:10:20,639
- That's applied sciences, okay?

139
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:22,813
And don't call me Jackie.

140
00:10:22,813 --> 00:10:26,986
I really and truly hate
being called Jackie.

141
00:10:26,986 --> 00:10:28,903
- You know what your problem is?

142
00:10:28,903 --> 00:10:30,616
Lack of sex.

143
00:10:30,616 --> 00:10:31,496
- What?

144
00:10:31,496 --> 00:10:34,217
- Honey, we have to get Jack a woman.

145
00:10:34,217 --> 00:10:36,493
He might explode if don't.

146
00:10:36,493 --> 00:10:37,906
- Why you guys picking on me?

147
00:10:37,906 --> 00:10:39,483
Pick on Brad or something.

148
00:10:39,483 --> 00:10:40,422
- She's right, man.

149
00:10:40,422 --> 00:10:43,710
Any fine wine Jack,
doesn't improve with age.

150
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:46,607
You got to use it or loose it.

151
00:10:46,607 --> 00:10:47,637
- Don't look at me.

152
00:10:47,637 --> 00:10:49,245
I gave up dating for my work.

153
00:10:49,245 --> 00:10:50,768
- What does she know anyway?

154
00:10:50,768 --> 00:10:54,527
- I'll have you know I
just aced my term paper.

155
00:10:54,527 --> 00:10:56,743
- No shit, what's it on?

156
00:10:56,743 --> 00:10:58,683
- Handedness through the ages.

157
00:10:58,683 --> 00:11:00,615
Real mystical type stuff.

158
00:11:00,615 --> 00:11:01,448
(thunder cracks)

159
00:11:01,448 --> 00:11:02,281
- Handedness?

160
00:11:02,281 --> 00:11:03,521
What's handedness?

161
00:11:03,521 --> 00:11:06,188
- Well it's not a football term.

162
00:11:07,096 --> 00:11:09,777
- It refers to the left hand
and all the superstition

163
00:11:09,777 --> 00:11:11,556
that surrounds it.

164
00:11:11,556 --> 00:11:13,159
Many cultures believe that

165
00:11:13,159 --> 00:11:15,133
the left hand is a symbol of evil.

166
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:18,281
And that left handed people
are servants of the devil.

167
00:11:18,281 --> 00:11:19,635
That kind of thing.

168
00:11:19,635 --> 00:11:21,265
- Sounds pretty messed up to me.

169
00:11:21,265 --> 00:11:23,032
- Hey I didn't make this up.

170
00:11:23,032 --> 00:11:25,733
I mean my dissertation
focuses on the fact that the

171
00:11:25,733 --> 00:11:27,283
myth of handedness started

172
00:11:27,283 --> 00:11:29,761
because left handed people are so rare.

173
00:11:29,761 --> 00:11:32,742
Ancient cultures glommed
onto anything out of the norm

174
00:11:32,742 --> 00:11:35,062
and made it quote, unquote evil.

175
00:11:35,062 --> 00:11:36,268
You know.

176
00:11:36,268 --> 00:11:37,580
- So,

177
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:41,232
I'm a bad guy, just
because I'm a south paw?

178
00:11:41,232 --> 00:11:42,814
- Let's hope.

179
00:11:42,814 --> 00:11:46,272
- Hey and speaking of kooky magic stuff.

180
00:11:46,272 --> 00:11:48,289
- Oh, our lovely hostess.

181
00:11:48,289 --> 00:11:49,122
- [Scott] Whoo.

182
00:11:49,122 --> 00:11:49,955
- Encore.

183
00:11:49,955 --> 00:11:50,788
(applause and cheering)

184
00:11:50,788 --> 00:11:52,538
- [Brad] You go girl.

185
00:11:55,245 --> 00:11:58,551
- Whoa is this a costume party or what?

186
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:01,390
- No I just threw this old thing on.

187
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:03,603
But I'm sure you'll
discover that it sort of

188
00:12:03,603 --> 00:12:06,391
fits the theme of my little party.

189
00:12:06,391 --> 00:12:07,224
- Theme?

190
00:12:07,224 --> 00:12:08,057
(rock music in background)

191
00:12:08,057 --> 00:12:10,247
- Well first of all kids,

192
00:12:10,247 --> 00:12:12,908
I have to thank you
for coming out tonight.

193
00:12:12,908 --> 00:12:15,538
As I explained to you all
when I passed out the invites,

194
00:12:15,538 --> 00:12:18,632
tonight is a very special
night of the year for me.

195
00:12:18,632 --> 00:12:22,331
And I really wanted to
celebrate it with my friends.

196
00:12:22,331 --> 00:12:24,636
So with out further delay,

197
00:12:24,636 --> 00:12:25,553
let's rock.

198
00:12:29,118 --> 00:12:30,785
- [Tony] Whoa, shit.

199
00:12:31,766 --> 00:12:33,264
Look.

200
00:12:33,264 --> 00:12:36,001
It's like a Dio live evil poster.

201
00:12:36,001 --> 00:12:37,501
Far fucken out.

202
00:12:37,501 --> 00:12:39,265
- Wow a pentagram.

203
00:12:39,265 --> 00:12:42,732
As in protects you from evil
type pentagram, or what?

204
00:12:42,732 --> 00:12:44,543
- Well that depends, Janet.

205
00:12:44,543 --> 00:12:46,663
Do you believe in evil spirits?

206
00:12:46,663 --> 00:12:49,727
- Well I believe in all
kinds of kooky shit.

207
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:51,310
- Speaking of that.

208
00:12:52,209 --> 00:12:54,208
So do you mind if I party?

209
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:55,901
- By all means.

210
00:12:55,901 --> 00:12:56,810
- Alright.

211
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:58,107
- Tony?

212
00:12:58,107 --> 00:13:03,067
- No it's just, you know,
for use of tobaco products.

213
00:13:03,067 --> 00:13:06,684
- You don't part with tobacco,
you lying little stooge.

214
00:13:06,684 --> 00:13:09,115
- Doesn't look like I'm going
to party at all tonight.

215
00:13:09,115 --> 00:13:10,745
Since mom's here.

216
00:13:10,745 --> 00:13:12,195
- Fathers lock up your daughters,

217
00:13:12,195 --> 00:13:13,520
'cause ole Scott Meredith's

218
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:17,276
got an alcohol related death wish tonight.

219
00:13:17,276 --> 00:13:19,160
- Honey I thought we
weren't going to drink

220
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,053
any hard stuff tonight.

221
00:13:21,053 --> 00:13:23,527
I mean, Jack's got Janet.

222
00:13:23,527 --> 00:13:24,575
Tony and Brad.

223
00:13:24,575 --> 00:13:27,385
So you're going to be the one who's able

224
00:13:27,385 --> 00:13:30,316
to drive you and me out of here tonight.

225
00:13:30,316 --> 00:13:31,149
- Huh?

226
00:13:32,289 --> 00:13:34,218
- I can always take a cab.

227
00:13:34,218 --> 00:13:36,135
Remember that, slugger.

228
00:13:38,136 --> 00:13:39,417
- Is there a problem?

229
00:13:39,417 --> 00:13:40,605
- No.

230
00:13:40,605 --> 00:13:41,522
No problem.

231
00:13:42,602 --> 00:13:46,365
- Hey Elizabeth I don't mean to be picky,

232
00:13:46,365 --> 00:13:48,539
but your folks need to
hire a maid or something.

233
00:13:48,539 --> 00:13:51,872
- Okay you definitely have issues, babe.

234
00:13:52,807 --> 00:13:55,807
- Confectioners sugar, with
a little bit of backing soda

235
00:13:55,807 --> 00:13:57,334
added for good measure.

236
00:13:57,334 --> 00:13:59,149
I worked at this haunted
house last Halloween,

237
00:13:59,149 --> 00:14:00,540
we used the same thing.

238
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:03,727
Tre elaborate, I'm impressed.

239
00:14:03,727 --> 00:14:06,850
- So wow, you put all these
cobwebs and stuff out here

240
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:08,172
just for the part?

241
00:14:08,172 --> 00:14:11,062
- As I told you, it's the theme.

242
00:14:11,062 --> 00:14:12,455
- And what's the theme?

243
00:14:12,455 --> 00:14:15,102
I'm psychotic and I wished
it was Halloween again?

244
00:14:15,102 --> 00:14:16,531
- Just knock it off Maria.

245
00:14:16,531 --> 00:14:19,142
- Look I know some of you have
your reservations about me.

246
00:14:19,142 --> 00:14:19,975
- Well I--

247
00:14:21,182 --> 00:14:22,848
- I totally understand, Maria.

248
00:14:22,848 --> 00:14:24,116
It's alright.

249
00:14:24,116 --> 00:14:26,866
(thunder cracks)

250
00:14:31,102 --> 00:14:32,152
Let's get the mood going.

251
00:14:32,152 --> 00:14:33,669
(rock music)

252
00:14:33,669 --> 00:14:36,313
- So, you're this physics major, huh?

253
00:14:36,313 --> 00:14:37,937
- That's my curse, I guess.

254
00:14:37,937 --> 00:14:38,951
- Well do you think maybe later on

255
00:14:38,951 --> 00:14:40,023
you can look at my guitar?

256
00:14:40,023 --> 00:14:42,105
I mean the amp is totally fried on it.

257
00:14:42,105 --> 00:14:45,222
- I don't know that much
about musical instruments.

258
00:14:45,222 --> 00:14:46,177
- Well shit that's okay.

259
00:14:46,177 --> 00:14:49,445
I mean you look like a
fairly smart guy and all.

260
00:14:49,445 --> 00:14:50,278
- Thanks.

261
00:14:50,278 --> 00:14:51,361
- No problem.

262
00:14:52,982 --> 00:14:54,315
- You party man?

263
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:56,423
- No.

264
00:14:57,318 --> 00:15:00,201
- You know that doesn't work anymore.

265
00:15:00,201 --> 00:15:02,107
- What doesn't work?

266
00:15:02,107 --> 00:15:04,570
- That whole just say no to drugs crap.

267
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:07,955
Look it's been tried, and I'm
here to say, it doesn't work,

268
00:15:07,955 --> 00:15:08,978
so go ahead.

269
00:15:08,978 --> 00:15:10,806
- Well I just don't
get into it personally.

270
00:15:10,806 --> 00:15:12,541
But thanks for the offer.

271
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:13,682
- Alright, that's cool you know.

272
00:15:13,682 --> 00:15:15,438
Once my friend Skeeter,
he wanted me to have some

273
00:15:15,438 --> 00:15:17,057
gold pane out of a baggie.

274
00:15:17,057 --> 00:15:18,396
I was like, no way dude.

275
00:15:18,396 --> 00:15:20,712
Cause that stuffs totally bogus.

276
00:15:20,712 --> 00:15:21,649
- Good.

277
00:15:21,649 --> 00:15:23,050
At least you didn't do it.

278
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:24,414
- No, no, don't get me wrong man.

279
00:15:24,414 --> 00:15:26,047
Of course I still did it.

280
00:15:26,047 --> 00:15:26,880
But I was right.

281
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,681
That stuff was so bogus man.

282
00:15:29,681 --> 00:15:30,598
- I'll bet.

283
00:15:31,997 --> 00:15:32,830
Guys.

284
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:36,248
- You had to tell him that
stupid gold pane story.

285
00:15:36,248 --> 00:15:37,418
(scoffs)

286
00:15:37,418 --> 00:15:38,438
What's wrong with you?

287
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:40,456
(door bell rings)

288
00:15:40,456 --> 00:15:42,093
- Late arrival.

289
00:15:42,093 --> 00:15:44,178
Please excuse me while I answer the door,

290
00:15:44,178 --> 00:15:45,011
won't you?

291
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:49,676
- You mean more people are actually going

292
00:15:49,676 --> 00:15:50,951
to show up to this thing?

293
00:15:50,951 --> 00:15:52,557
- Oh, I hope it's the pizza guy.

294
00:15:52,557 --> 00:15:53,557
I am hungry.

295
00:15:59,507 --> 00:16:00,459
- What?

296
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:02,083
- You know what.

297
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:04,032
Your flirting with her, aren't you?

298
00:16:04,032 --> 00:16:05,800
I think you're just being paranoid again.

299
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,142
- Look, you've flirted
with other girls before,

300
00:16:08,142 --> 00:16:09,920
and I'm cool with it.

301
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,563
I mean, I know I'm the one
your leaving with at the end

302
00:16:12,563 --> 00:16:14,340
of the night, and no harm done.

303
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:16,405
But this is different.

304
00:16:16,405 --> 00:16:17,960
- Honey, I'm not flirting, okay?

305
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:20,314
Can you just chill out for a
minute or two and have fun.

306
00:16:20,314 --> 00:16:21,157
Have a drink.

307
00:16:21,157 --> 00:16:23,346
You always have fun when you drink.

308
00:16:23,346 --> 00:16:24,824
- I think you like her.

309
00:16:24,824 --> 00:16:27,007
(thunder cracks)

310
00:16:27,007 --> 00:16:29,023
- This is a big place.

311
00:16:29,023 --> 00:16:30,837
Why don't we go upstairs,

312
00:16:30,837 --> 00:16:33,509
and I'll show you how
much I'd rather have you,

313
00:16:33,509 --> 00:16:34,759
than her, okay?

314
00:16:36,278 --> 00:16:37,314
- Okay.

315
00:16:37,314 --> 00:16:41,481
(thunder cracks and rolls into distance)

316
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:47,678
- This place is really creepy, Scott.

317
00:16:47,678 --> 00:16:50,596
- You know Brad got me
thinking back there.

318
00:16:50,596 --> 00:16:52,021
I wonder where Bob and Margaret are.

319
00:16:52,021 --> 00:16:53,606
(giggles)

320
00:16:53,606 --> 00:16:57,046
- Maybe we'll bump into the in
one of those spare bedrooms.

321
00:16:57,046 --> 00:16:58,209
- Jesus, maybe I should mention

322
00:16:58,209 --> 00:17:00,555
something to Elizabeth about it.

323
00:17:00,555 --> 00:17:02,426
- Can her name not edge it's way into

324
00:17:02,426 --> 00:17:04,931
everything that comes out of your mouth.

325
00:17:04,931 --> 00:17:05,764
- Sorry.

326
00:17:06,676 --> 00:17:08,445
- It's okay.

327
00:17:08,445 --> 00:17:10,031
And,

328
00:17:10,031 --> 00:17:12,884
I'm really sorry about everything
that went down tonight.

329
00:17:12,884 --> 00:17:15,469
I mean, I like Elizabeth a lot.

330
00:17:15,469 --> 00:17:18,815
It's just that sometimes
I get a vibe from her.

331
00:17:18,815 --> 00:17:20,815
Like she's watching you.

332
00:17:22,155 --> 00:17:24,322
So, I guess I get jealous.

333
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:29,067
- Hey, I'll admit she's
a little out of the norm.

334
00:17:29,067 --> 00:17:30,479
But she seems really friendly,

335
00:17:30,479 --> 00:17:32,703
and she's been nothing but
nice to all of us tonight.

336
00:17:32,703 --> 00:17:35,437
So I think you ought to
cut her a little slack.

337
00:17:35,437 --> 00:17:38,373
- Listen Scott, I never got
to tell you all the stuff

338
00:17:38,373 --> 00:17:40,162
about this old house.

339
00:17:40,162 --> 00:17:43,240
What the kids used to say about it.

340
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,604
- Yeah?

341
00:17:44,604 --> 00:17:45,719
- It's haunted.

342
00:17:45,719 --> 00:17:47,815
(laughter)

343
00:17:47,815 --> 00:17:50,314
- No wonder you're all
freaked out about being here.

344
00:17:50,314 --> 00:17:51,990
I mean, think about it.

345
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:53,983
It's been building up
in your mind for years,

346
00:17:53,983 --> 00:17:57,329
you just wound up
convincing yourself of it.

347
00:17:57,329 --> 00:17:59,193
- It's not funny Scott.

348
00:17:59,193 --> 00:18:00,914
Too many people talk
about this place for there

349
00:18:00,914 --> 00:18:03,634
not to be something to it.

350
00:18:03,634 --> 00:18:05,142
- It's in your head, sweetheart.

351
00:18:05,142 --> 00:18:06,257
That's all.

352
00:18:06,257 --> 00:18:07,530
- Yeah?

353
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:08,823
- Yeah.

354
00:18:08,823 --> 00:18:11,513
You just need someone
to distract you from it

355
00:18:11,513 --> 00:18:13,595
for a little while.

356
00:18:13,595 --> 00:18:17,678
(heavy rock music in background)

357
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:24,516
(thunder cracks and booms)

358
00:18:27,617 --> 00:18:29,505
- Can you believe this stuff?

359
00:18:29,505 --> 00:18:33,248
I mean come on, it's not Halloween.

360
00:18:33,248 --> 00:18:36,761
- What do you say we just
find ourselves a room, huh?

361
00:18:36,761 --> 00:18:37,594
- Alright.

362
00:18:38,717 --> 00:18:41,757
(thunder cracks)

363
00:18:41,757 --> 00:18:43,924
(giggles)

364
00:18:46,734 --> 00:18:50,817
(heavy rock music in background)

365
00:18:55,531 --> 00:18:57,614
- Wonder what this means?

366
00:19:01,737 --> 00:19:04,510
- Spells out Necronomicon.

367
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:05,343
See?

368
00:19:07,076 --> 00:19:09,503
I'm kidding, I've no God
damn idea what it says.

369
00:19:09,503 --> 00:19:11,253
Maybe it's in French.

370
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,995
Well this part says Le Fay,
that much I can actually read.

371
00:19:15,995 --> 00:19:18,699
- What do you think it is?

372
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:19,532
- I don't know.

373
00:19:19,532 --> 00:19:22,222
Its too old to be a
photo album I'm guessing.

374
00:19:22,222 --> 00:19:24,160
- I'm serious.

375
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,014
- I don't know,

376
00:19:25,014 --> 00:19:27,236
why don't you ask our
hostess with the mostess

377
00:19:27,236 --> 00:19:29,048
when she moseys back in here.

378
00:19:29,048 --> 00:19:31,578
I'll just grab my ax.

379
00:19:31,578 --> 00:19:33,917
- Everybody, I would like
to introduce my friend

380
00:19:33,917 --> 00:19:36,291
Jennifer to our little gathering.

381
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:38,098
Jennifer this is everybody.

382
00:19:38,098 --> 00:19:39,522
Feel free to make yourself at home.

383
00:19:39,522 --> 00:19:42,768
We were just getting started
actually when you showed up.

384
00:19:42,768 --> 00:19:44,560
- Hey, Brad Peyton.

385
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,393
- Hi.

386
00:19:45,393 --> 00:19:46,810
- Hey, you smoke?

387
00:19:48,452 --> 00:19:50,109
It's good stuff.

388
00:19:50,109 --> 00:19:51,474
Grew it in my closet.

389
00:19:51,474 --> 00:19:52,755
- Wow.

390
00:19:52,755 --> 00:19:53,588
Jennifer?

391
00:19:54,873 --> 00:19:57,202
Jennifer Bainbridge?

392
00:19:57,202 --> 00:19:58,801
You and I had progressive psych together

393
00:19:58,801 --> 00:19:59,895
last year, remember?

394
00:19:59,895 --> 00:20:01,715
I had to pad out my humanities credit,

395
00:20:01,715 --> 00:20:02,548
don't ask why.

396
00:20:02,548 --> 00:20:03,466
There you were.

397
00:20:03,466 --> 00:20:04,627
- Yes, Jack Smith.

398
00:20:04,627 --> 00:20:05,742
You sat in the back row.

399
00:20:05,742 --> 00:20:06,882
- Wow.

400
00:20:06,882 --> 00:20:08,578
Yeah, that's right.

401
00:20:08,578 --> 00:20:09,762
I remember when you'd come in

402
00:20:09,762 --> 00:20:14,145
and you'd just gotten
those glasses, and...

403
00:20:14,145 --> 00:20:17,362
You know what I'm going to
shut up now before I make

404
00:20:17,362 --> 00:20:20,913
any bigger an idiot out of
myself than already have.

405
00:20:20,913 --> 00:20:23,087
- Don't worry, you're doing fine.

406
00:20:23,087 --> 00:20:24,139
- Thanks.

407
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:26,428
(thunder cracks)

408
00:20:26,428 --> 00:20:28,433
- Where did Scott and Maria go?

409
00:20:28,433 --> 00:20:31,666
- Probably a good idea if you don't ask.

410
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:33,821
(dramatic music)

411
00:20:33,821 --> 00:20:37,988
(thunder cracks and
rolls into the distance)

412
00:20:45,937 --> 00:20:48,929
- Okay everybody, I'd like
to get this thing going.

413
00:20:48,929 --> 00:20:51,758
I think we should all
sit around the pentagram.

414
00:20:51,758 --> 00:20:52,802
- What for?

415
00:20:52,802 --> 00:20:55,826
- I have a method to my madness, trust me.

416
00:20:55,826 --> 00:20:57,408
- [Brad] What about the
other guests you invited?

417
00:20:57,408 --> 00:20:59,379
What if they show up?

418
00:20:59,379 --> 00:21:01,697
- Then they show up.

419
00:21:01,697 --> 00:21:03,541
Anyway the sun has officially gone down,

420
00:21:03,541 --> 00:21:06,268
and I want to start my
May Day celebration.

421
00:21:06,268 --> 00:21:07,970
Who would like to join me?

422
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:08,803
- I'll do it.

423
00:21:08,803 --> 00:21:09,970
What the hell.

424
00:21:15,168 --> 00:21:16,535
- Dude.

425
00:21:16,535 --> 00:21:17,959
You got to sit next to
the little woman, man.

426
00:21:17,959 --> 00:21:18,929
Don't you know anything.

427
00:21:18,929 --> 00:21:21,207
- Okay Tony, we're not
in high school anymore.

428
00:21:21,207 --> 00:21:22,854
Can we put down the bong for a second

429
00:21:22,854 --> 00:21:23,857
and relate to that concept.

430
00:21:23,857 --> 00:21:24,972
(thunder cracks)

431
00:21:24,972 --> 00:21:26,842
Thanks a bunch.

432
00:21:26,842 --> 00:21:28,013
- It's okay Jack.

433
00:21:28,013 --> 00:21:29,433
You can sit next to me if you want,

434
00:21:29,433 --> 00:21:30,516
I don't mind.

435
00:21:31,743 --> 00:21:32,576
- Hi.

436
00:21:33,469 --> 00:21:34,902
- Hi your self.

437
00:21:34,902 --> 00:21:37,716
(thunder rolls)

438
00:21:37,716 --> 00:21:41,216
(heart beats in distance)

439
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:53,368
- Your not joining us?

440
00:21:53,368 --> 00:21:54,201
- You know what,

441
00:21:54,201 --> 00:21:56,929
I think I'm just going
stand over here and watch.

442
00:21:56,929 --> 00:21:59,365
Seances aren't my thing.

443
00:21:59,365 --> 00:22:01,011
- Well it's not exactly a seance,

444
00:22:01,011 --> 00:22:04,287
but feel free to do whatever you wish.

445
00:22:04,287 --> 00:22:06,454
- Okay, maybe I'll sit in.

446
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,618
- Hey I got this great
party game we can all play

447
00:22:09,618 --> 00:22:12,180
since we're all sitting in a circle.

448
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:14,559
You dudes ever hear of suck and blow?

449
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:16,777
- I have something else in mind.

450
00:22:16,777 --> 00:22:20,025
- If this has anything to do
with eating a human heart,

451
00:22:20,025 --> 00:22:21,358
I'm out of here.

452
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,337
- I want to tell you what
this night truly means to me.

453
00:22:25,337 --> 00:22:27,935
But before I do, I want
us all to join hands.

454
00:22:27,935 --> 00:22:29,917
- I don't know if I'm
into that love in concept.

455
00:22:29,917 --> 00:22:31,586
- Oh it's nothing like that.

456
00:22:31,586 --> 00:22:33,462
It's just important to
be as close together

457
00:22:33,462 --> 00:22:35,762
as possible to form a circle.

458
00:22:35,762 --> 00:22:37,495
It's all part of May Day.

459
00:22:37,495 --> 00:22:39,007
- What is May Day, anyway?

460
00:22:39,007 --> 00:22:41,256
I've never heard of it.

461
00:22:41,256 --> 00:22:44,239
Then I guess I don't get out much.

462
00:22:44,239 --> 00:22:45,969
- Some Wiccan thing.

463
00:22:45,969 --> 00:22:49,552
(heart beat in background)

464
00:22:54,688 --> 00:22:55,933
(thunder cracks)

465
00:22:55,933 --> 00:22:57,196
- I don't know if we
should sit on this stuff,

466
00:22:57,196 --> 00:23:00,113
or check it out down in the museum.

467
00:23:03,265 --> 00:23:04,265
- I like it.

468
00:23:06,037 --> 00:23:09,191
- I'm afraid it predates most religions.

469
00:23:09,191 --> 00:23:12,480
In early times some people
believed that this day

470
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,396
was the one day of the
year, when the moon's full,

471
00:23:15,396 --> 00:23:18,051
and the position of the
stars came down to Earth

472
00:23:18,051 --> 00:23:20,965
in a sort of perfect focus point.

473
00:23:20,965 --> 00:23:23,929
A point that allowed terrible
cataclysm and havoc to be

474
00:23:23,929 --> 00:23:26,399
unleashed upon mankind.

475
00:23:26,399 --> 00:23:28,846
They say Pompeii was buried under ash

476
00:23:28,846 --> 00:23:32,174
after a particularly powerful May Day.

477
00:23:32,174 --> 00:23:36,341
The black plague, the day the
atomic bomb was conceived.

478
00:23:37,253 --> 00:23:39,489
(thunder rolls into the distance)

479
00:23:39,489 --> 00:23:43,322
(heart beating in background)

480
00:23:47,729 --> 00:23:50,266
And if you were a practitioner
of the black arts,

481
00:23:50,266 --> 00:23:53,368
well it was a day of great tribute.

482
00:23:53,368 --> 00:23:56,041
A day to commune with the dark arts.

483
00:23:56,041 --> 00:23:57,284
- [Janet] Bitchen.

484
00:23:57,284 --> 00:23:59,885
- [Brad] Why would anybody
want to celebrate that?

485
00:23:59,885 --> 00:24:00,718
- [Elizabeth] For the same reason

486
00:24:00,718 --> 00:24:02,843
people celebrate Halloween.

487
00:24:02,843 --> 00:24:05,602
If people put on masks and
carve out jack-o-lanterns,

488
00:24:05,602 --> 00:24:09,475
and ask for candy, it wards
off the darker connotation

489
00:24:09,475 --> 00:24:13,483
that Halloween was once the
day people locked their doors

490
00:24:13,483 --> 00:24:15,080
and hid from the evil spirits

491
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,830
and demons that roamed the Earth.

492
00:24:19,473 --> 00:24:20,306
- Well,

493
00:24:21,205 --> 00:24:23,732
At least this place has it's own bath.

494
00:24:23,732 --> 00:24:26,359
- Really, does it have running water,

495
00:24:26,359 --> 00:24:29,413
or just a big ole chamber pot?

496
00:24:29,413 --> 00:24:31,663
- Got it's own shower, too.

497
00:24:34,399 --> 00:24:36,646
- Now that we are all part of a circle.

498
00:24:36,646 --> 00:24:39,121
A sacred circle I might add.

499
00:24:39,121 --> 00:24:40,485
Since we are all seated around

500
00:24:40,485 --> 00:24:42,700
an ancient and powerful symbol,

501
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:44,617
it is time for a story.

502
00:24:45,539 --> 00:24:47,341
Though it took place centuries ago,

503
00:24:47,341 --> 00:24:49,694
it is my story too.

504
00:24:49,694 --> 00:24:52,916
It's repercussions have
reached down through the years.

505
00:24:52,916 --> 00:24:54,765
Through the bloodline
of the Le Fay family,

506
00:24:54,765 --> 00:24:57,337
and even now touch me.

507
00:24:57,337 --> 00:24:59,362
(thunder cracks loudly)

508
00:24:59,362 --> 00:25:03,529
Tonight marks the 300th
anniversary of my ancestors death.

509
00:25:04,977 --> 00:25:07,298
Her name was Lilith.

510
00:25:07,298 --> 00:25:09,324
Named after the first woman.

511
00:25:09,324 --> 00:25:12,567
The true first woman who God
cast out of the Garden of Eden

512
00:25:12,567 --> 00:25:15,900
as an abomination before he created Eve.

513
00:25:16,839 --> 00:25:18,006
Lilith Le Fay.

514
00:25:19,546 --> 00:25:22,048
She came across the Atlantic
when she was a child,

515
00:25:22,048 --> 00:25:26,279
and lived in this house
until the night she died.

516
00:25:26,279 --> 00:25:29,676
When she was just a little
older than I am now.

517
00:25:29,676 --> 00:25:32,593
(soft jazzy music)

518
00:25:35,547 --> 00:25:37,214
- So, what do we do?

519
00:25:39,902 --> 00:25:41,988
- I think we can come up with something,

520
00:25:41,988 --> 00:25:44,593
if we put our minds to it.

521
00:25:44,593 --> 00:25:46,426
Could be a long night.

522
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,797
- And how long is long?

523
00:25:51,601 --> 00:25:52,434
- Very.

524
00:25:53,754 --> 00:25:55,548
- Well if that's the case

525
00:25:55,548 --> 00:25:58,015
I think I might have an idea or two.

526
00:25:58,015 --> 00:25:58,848
- Such as?

527
00:26:04,946 --> 00:26:07,114
- [Elizabeth] She grew up in
the company of her parents,

528
00:26:07,114 --> 00:26:10,880
who both believed themselves
to be powerful sorcerers.

529
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,231
They instructed her in
the ways of black magic.

530
00:26:13,231 --> 00:26:17,508
Or speaking to the dark worlds
that lay beyond our own.

531
00:26:17,508 --> 00:26:19,560
And it is said that she became

532
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,881
a favorite daughter of the Dark Ones.

533
00:26:21,881 --> 00:26:23,640
And was more powerful than her mother

534
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:26,130
and father could ever imagine.

535
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:30,528
The older Lilith became the
more uncontrollable she became.

536
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:31,888
Her behavior was wanton,

537
00:26:31,888 --> 00:26:35,138
even by the standards
her own family lived by.

538
00:26:35,138 --> 00:26:38,239
Soon she was beyond obeying
the rules of anyone.

539
00:26:38,239 --> 00:26:40,799
And engaged in all manner
of what was considered

540
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:42,466
forbidden practices.

541
00:26:43,658 --> 00:26:44,575
Elicit sex,

542
00:26:45,595 --> 00:26:47,012
drinking alcohol,

543
00:26:47,848 --> 00:26:50,903
dancing in graveyards on moonlit nights.

544
00:26:50,903 --> 00:26:51,736
Blasphemy.

545
00:26:53,041 --> 00:26:55,292
And she dared to look
in her fathers grimoire,

546
00:26:55,292 --> 00:26:57,993
which according to the family legend,

547
00:26:57,993 --> 00:27:02,076
was one of the most powerful
tomes on the planet.

548
00:27:04,172 --> 00:27:06,810
Her father tried to punish
her for her indiscretions,

549
00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:08,977
but Lilith was too strong.

550
00:27:09,964 --> 00:27:11,960
And the only master she listened to now

551
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:14,194
were the voices of the Dark Ones.

552
00:27:14,194 --> 00:27:16,955
The ones who gave her power.

553
00:27:16,955 --> 00:27:18,588
And one night,

554
00:27:18,588 --> 00:27:20,204
so they say,

555
00:27:20,204 --> 00:27:24,691
Lilith's parents were suddenly
and inexplicably dead.

556
00:27:24,691 --> 00:27:26,416
They say Lilith may have killed them,

557
00:27:26,416 --> 00:27:28,554
but so many things had
been attributed to her

558
00:27:28,554 --> 00:27:30,118
that the death of her family members

559
00:27:30,118 --> 00:27:33,192
simply passed on into myth.

560
00:27:33,192 --> 00:27:36,563
She abducted a child from
Dunwich in the dead of night,

561
00:27:36,563 --> 00:27:37,896
on May Day 1698.

562
00:27:40,153 --> 00:27:44,121
The Dark Ones told her that
a sacrifice must be made.

563
00:27:44,121 --> 00:27:46,954
The heart of a true innocent.

564
00:27:46,954 --> 00:27:48,728
And she took the child here,

565
00:27:48,728 --> 00:27:50,444
to this house,

566
00:27:50,444 --> 00:27:52,691
with the intention of
cutting out his heart,

567
00:27:52,691 --> 00:27:55,201
in an elaborate ceremony.

568
00:27:55,201 --> 00:27:58,435
- Aw man, is the kid going to be alright?

569
00:27:58,435 --> 00:28:00,530
- The child was never harmed.

570
00:28:00,530 --> 00:28:01,675
For you see,

571
00:28:01,675 --> 00:28:04,604
the town elders sent forth
a tribunal of witch hunters

572
00:28:04,604 --> 00:28:07,286
moments after Lilith kidnapped him.

573
00:28:07,286 --> 00:28:11,382
They arrived shortly before the
sacrifice was to take place.

574
00:28:11,382 --> 00:28:14,737
The power that was promised
to Lilith never came.

575
00:28:14,737 --> 00:28:17,815
For you see, there was
only one form of punishment

576
00:28:17,815 --> 00:28:20,400
regarding the crime of witchcraft.

577
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,733
She was burned at the stake.

578
00:28:24,515 --> 00:28:27,182
(fire crackles)

579
00:28:38,728 --> 00:28:42,895
(chains rattle, people
yelling in background)

580
00:28:54,427 --> 00:28:57,677
(ethereal voices sing)

581
00:29:03,914 --> 00:29:06,331
(bell tolls)

582
00:29:09,515 --> 00:29:10,880
- Where am I?

583
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,675
- Silence witch.

584
00:29:12,675 --> 00:29:15,205
- Scott, what's going on here?

585
00:29:15,205 --> 00:29:18,842
- Thou has been accused of
the crime of witchcraft.

586
00:29:18,842 --> 00:29:20,235
- I'm me, I'm Brad Peyton.

587
00:29:20,235 --> 00:29:21,757
You guys know me.

588
00:29:21,757 --> 00:29:23,207
Stop this.

589
00:29:23,207 --> 00:29:26,367
- For the crimes of witchcraft, murder,

590
00:29:26,367 --> 00:29:30,210
and thy unholy alliance
with the one I call Legion.

591
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:32,754
We, the goodly servants of the Lord,

592
00:29:32,754 --> 00:29:35,292
the elders of the township of Dunwich,

593
00:29:35,292 --> 00:29:40,008
sentence thee, Lilith Le Fay,
to be burned at the stake,

594
00:29:40,008 --> 00:29:42,925
and condemned to eternal damnation.

595
00:29:46,676 --> 00:29:47,593
- Eternity.

596
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:50,548
It's a real bitch.

597
00:29:50,548 --> 00:29:52,965
(bell tolls)

598
00:29:54,717 --> 00:29:57,458
(frantic creepy music)

599
00:29:57,458 --> 00:29:59,223
- Somebody wake me up.

600
00:29:59,223 --> 00:30:00,570
Don't let them burn me.

601
00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:01,653
- Whoa, dude.

602
00:30:02,981 --> 00:30:04,313
- I saw.

603
00:30:04,313 --> 00:30:06,135
- Jesus, what happened Brad?

604
00:30:06,135 --> 00:30:07,237
- It was so real.

605
00:30:07,237 --> 00:30:08,237
I was there.

606
00:30:09,149 --> 00:30:10,206
When they were burning Lilith.

607
00:30:10,206 --> 00:30:11,221
It was me.

608
00:30:11,221 --> 00:30:12,134
It was,

609
00:30:12,134 --> 00:30:14,129
I felt the fire burning me.

610
00:30:14,129 --> 00:30:16,155
- You must have fallen
asleep during the story.

611
00:30:16,155 --> 00:30:17,072
That's all.

612
00:30:18,278 --> 00:30:20,342
You never left the room.

613
00:30:20,342 --> 00:30:22,002
It was probably just a bad dream.

614
00:30:22,002 --> 00:30:23,914
- I've never had a dream like this before.

615
00:30:23,914 --> 00:30:24,868
- That' all it was.

616
00:30:24,868 --> 00:30:25,701
I swear.

617
00:30:29,607 --> 00:30:30,440
Well,

618
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:33,067
I certainly won't stop anybody

619
00:30:33,067 --> 00:30:36,114
if anyone would like to leave.

620
00:30:36,114 --> 00:30:38,062
- It's not your fault.

621
00:30:38,062 --> 00:30:41,663
I guess I just got spooked
out by the whole thing.

622
00:30:41,663 --> 00:30:43,580
Maybe I should go home.

623
00:30:45,131 --> 00:30:47,131
- The phone is upstairs,

624
00:30:47,131 --> 00:30:49,470
so I'll just go and call you a cab.

625
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:52,873
That way everybody else
can stick around and party.

626
00:30:52,873 --> 00:30:55,301
Might be a few minutes though.

627
00:30:55,301 --> 00:30:56,301
- Could you?

628
00:30:57,546 --> 00:30:59,977
I'm sorry about the way that I acted.

629
00:30:59,977 --> 00:31:02,000
- Must have had a bad trip, man.

630
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,275
I have them all the time.

631
00:31:04,275 --> 00:31:07,025
(thunder cracks)

632
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:11,292
- I'm really glad we came up here Scott.

633
00:31:11,292 --> 00:31:14,331
I think we really needed it.

634
00:31:14,331 --> 00:31:17,578
(thunder cracks)

635
00:31:17,578 --> 00:31:20,524
At least one of us got comfortable.

636
00:31:20,524 --> 00:31:23,607
(slow intense music)

637
00:31:29,489 --> 00:31:32,299
- It's a strange way to
finally meet someone, huh?

638
00:31:32,299 --> 00:31:34,131
- Yeah I feel like I'm 14 again,

639
00:31:34,131 --> 00:31:37,358
and we're all at summer
camp telling ghost stories.

640
00:31:37,358 --> 00:31:38,933
- Dude.

641
00:31:38,933 --> 00:31:41,001
I got booted out of summer camp.

642
00:31:41,001 --> 00:31:43,090
Cause see they gave us
these pain pills if you like

643
00:31:43,090 --> 00:31:44,528
busted a leg or something.

644
00:31:44,528 --> 00:31:47,544
Only I kept busting my leg
to get more pills and stuff.

645
00:31:47,544 --> 00:31:49,694
Finally the camp counselor
said, you gotta go son.

646
00:31:49,694 --> 00:31:51,745
You got a drug problem.

647
00:31:51,745 --> 00:31:54,613
So my folks threw me in drug rehab.

648
00:31:54,613 --> 00:31:55,973
That's my story.

649
00:31:55,973 --> 00:31:56,806
The end.

650
00:31:57,742 --> 00:31:58,625
- Hey don't look over here.

651
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:01,078
I boosted a Mercedes
when I was 14 years old.

652
00:32:01,078 --> 00:32:03,158
Spent that whole summer in juvie hall.

653
00:32:03,158 --> 00:32:04,496
Sucked.

654
00:32:04,496 --> 00:32:05,329
- Yeah.

655
00:32:07,351 --> 00:32:08,868
- Me and my big mouth.

656
00:32:08,868 --> 00:32:10,142
(thunder cracks)

657
00:32:10,142 --> 00:32:13,385
- Hey, I really want to explore
this place a little bit.

658
00:32:13,385 --> 00:32:15,214
Would you like to join me?

659
00:32:15,214 --> 00:32:16,761
- Would I?

660
00:32:16,761 --> 00:32:17,594
I mean,

661
00:32:18,584 --> 00:32:20,183
yeah sure.

662
00:32:20,183 --> 00:32:21,683
Whatever you want.

663
00:32:22,545 --> 00:32:24,212
- Please, follow me.

664
00:32:25,272 --> 00:32:28,022
(thunder cracks)

665
00:32:29,603 --> 00:32:30,999
- Tell you what, slugger.

666
00:32:30,999 --> 00:32:32,178
While you sleep it off,

667
00:32:32,178 --> 00:32:35,261
I'm going to hop in the shower, deal?

668
00:32:37,307 --> 00:32:38,140
Deal.

669
00:32:40,213 --> 00:32:42,963
(thunder cracks)

670
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,983
(spooky music)

671
00:33:01,877 --> 00:33:02,710
- Guys?

672
00:33:05,859 --> 00:33:06,692
Elizabeth?

673
00:33:09,183 --> 00:33:10,016
Scotty?

674
00:33:12,768 --> 00:33:13,601
Anyone?

675
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:18,301
- I'm digging the torture
dungeon vibe in here.

676
00:33:18,301 --> 00:33:20,314
(laughter)

677
00:33:20,314 --> 00:33:22,622
- You know they say the
original Le Fay family had

678
00:33:22,622 --> 00:33:24,428
this mansion shipped,

679
00:33:24,428 --> 00:33:27,876
brick by brick, slap by stone slab,

680
00:33:27,876 --> 00:33:30,745
to Massachusetts from
their estate in France

681
00:33:30,745 --> 00:33:32,831
back in the early 1600s.

682
00:33:32,831 --> 00:33:34,066
- No shit?

683
00:33:34,066 --> 00:33:36,464
Why would they want to
do something like that?

684
00:33:36,464 --> 00:33:38,567
- Well I suspect Elizabeth's ancestors

685
00:33:38,567 --> 00:33:41,773
came to the new world for the
same reason the pilgrims did.

686
00:33:41,773 --> 00:33:43,971
To escape religious persecution.

687
00:33:43,971 --> 00:33:46,682
- So, they were puritans?

688
00:33:46,682 --> 00:33:48,437
- Not exactly.

689
00:33:48,437 --> 00:33:50,411
More like Satanists.

690
00:33:50,411 --> 00:33:51,244
- Great.

691
00:33:52,317 --> 00:33:55,183
(spooky music)

692
00:33:55,183 --> 00:33:56,183
- Elizabeth?

693
00:33:57,359 --> 00:33:58,359
Is that you?

694
00:34:03,048 --> 00:34:04,931
(thunder cracks)

695
00:34:04,931 --> 00:34:05,764
Elizabeth?

696
00:34:06,927 --> 00:34:08,828
- What other stuff did she tel you?

697
00:34:08,828 --> 00:34:11,206
- Well okay, like the Le
Fay family has always had

698
00:34:11,206 --> 00:34:14,611
this stigma of witchcraft
and evil attached to it.

699
00:34:14,611 --> 00:34:16,771
- Everybody around here knows that.

700
00:34:16,771 --> 00:34:19,695
But nobody think Elizabeth
is a witch or anything.

701
00:34:19,695 --> 00:34:21,229
At least I don't.

702
00:34:21,229 --> 00:34:22,642
- Remember Morgan Le Fay?

703
00:34:22,642 --> 00:34:24,462
King Arthur's legend?

704
00:34:24,462 --> 00:34:26,797
That's what I'm talking about.

705
00:34:26,797 --> 00:34:28,467
- You guys down there?

706
00:34:28,467 --> 00:34:31,217
(dramatic music)

707
00:34:36,176 --> 00:34:38,676
(water drips)

708
00:34:49,901 --> 00:34:51,361
- You mind,

709
00:34:51,361 --> 00:34:53,543
telling me what you're thinking about?

710
00:34:53,543 --> 00:34:56,505
- No, I'm just looking around.

711
00:34:56,505 --> 00:34:58,005
It's a nice place.

712
00:34:59,297 --> 00:35:01,863
- what's you take on the
whole witchcraft thing?

713
00:35:01,863 --> 00:35:03,859
- You're asking the wrong guy.

714
00:35:03,859 --> 00:35:06,709
I'm about as sickeningly
normal as it gets.

715
00:35:06,709 --> 00:35:09,076
The only thing I know about
witches is that they wear

716
00:35:09,076 --> 00:35:13,321
those weird pointy hats, and
ride around on broomsticks.

717
00:35:13,321 --> 00:35:16,135
- Yeah, but I bet you have a dark side.

718
00:35:16,135 --> 00:35:17,568
We all do.

719
00:35:17,568 --> 00:35:19,145
- Well,

720
00:35:19,145 --> 00:35:21,354
I'm a applied sciences teacher.

721
00:35:21,354 --> 00:35:22,468
How's that?

722
00:35:22,468 --> 00:35:24,866
- How does that fit into
the witchcraft equation?

723
00:35:24,866 --> 00:35:27,070
- Probably not very well.

724
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:29,298
However, I can tel you that the Le Fay's

725
00:35:29,298 --> 00:35:31,924
have a messed up wiring.

726
00:35:31,924 --> 00:35:33,122
- The wiring?

727
00:35:33,122 --> 00:35:35,076
- You see up here.

728
00:35:35,076 --> 00:35:37,245
You can find that kind of
house wiring in old English

729
00:35:37,245 --> 00:35:38,914
castles and stuff.

730
00:35:38,914 --> 00:35:40,294
They can't drill through the rock walls

731
00:35:40,294 --> 00:35:42,464
because of the maintenance
problems it causes,

732
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:45,649
so they just string it
along, exposed to the walls

733
00:35:45,649 --> 00:35:47,776
and cracks and stuff like in here.

734
00:35:47,776 --> 00:35:49,040
But you get a whole
different set of problems

735
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,137
doing it this way.

736
00:35:50,137 --> 00:35:51,405
Rock walls tend to get damp,

737
00:35:51,405 --> 00:35:54,404
short out the exposed
transformers all the time.

738
00:35:54,404 --> 00:35:56,081
I did an analysis on it back in--

739
00:35:56,081 --> 00:35:58,167
- That's pretty fascinating stuff, Jack.

740
00:35:58,167 --> 00:35:59,000
Really.

741
00:36:02,205 --> 00:36:05,153
- You had to talk about
the wiring, didn't you?

742
00:36:05,153 --> 00:36:07,903
(thunder cracks)

743
00:36:09,863 --> 00:36:12,992
- I call upon the forces
higher than I to release

744
00:36:12,992 --> 00:36:15,175
the energy that is held inside.

745
00:36:15,175 --> 00:36:19,253
I call upon thee, I call
upon thee, I invoke thee,

746
00:36:19,253 --> 00:36:21,101
my angels and demons.

747
00:36:21,101 --> 00:36:22,640
My gods and devils.

748
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:25,211
My divine goddess and dark lord.

749
00:36:25,211 --> 00:36:27,828
I call upon the ancestors
that watch over me,

750
00:36:27,828 --> 00:36:32,654
protect me, enfold me,
guide, and shape my destiny.

751
00:36:32,654 --> 00:36:35,404
(dramatic music)

752
00:36:55,428 --> 00:36:58,178
(thunder cracks)

753
00:37:04,547 --> 00:37:06,122
- Hey.

754
00:37:06,122 --> 00:37:07,513
I was hoping I would find me a copy of

755
00:37:07,513 --> 00:37:09,513
As you like it, in here.

756
00:37:10,492 --> 00:37:12,023
- Oh yeah.

757
00:37:12,023 --> 00:37:14,109
Well what girl could
live without her very own

758
00:37:14,109 --> 00:37:17,401
copy of the Complete
Predictions of Nostradamus?

759
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:19,851
(chuckles)

760
00:37:19,851 --> 00:37:22,851
(suspenseful music)

761
00:37:27,918 --> 00:37:28,835
- Holy cow.

762
00:37:29,896 --> 00:37:34,068
This looks like that book
Elizabeth had back in the den.

763
00:37:34,068 --> 00:37:36,495
There's got to be dozens of them in here.

764
00:37:36,495 --> 00:37:39,771
- You know, it's not so strange.

765
00:37:39,771 --> 00:37:41,318
I think I've heard of
something like this before

766
00:37:41,318 --> 00:37:43,195
where families keep multiple copies

767
00:37:43,195 --> 00:37:45,189
of the family bible around.

768
00:37:45,189 --> 00:37:46,983
You know like one around for
each member of the family,

769
00:37:46,983 --> 00:37:49,150
it's sort of like a diary.

770
00:37:52,005 --> 00:37:53,841
What are you doing?

771
00:37:53,841 --> 00:37:55,167
- Well right before you showed up,

772
00:37:55,167 --> 00:37:57,747
I was kind of looking
through the one in the den.

773
00:37:57,747 --> 00:37:59,747
Kind of got my interest.

774
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:02,651
I think it would be kind of
neat to find out where someone

775
00:38:02,651 --> 00:38:04,866
like Elizabeth came from.

776
00:38:04,866 --> 00:38:08,189
- I invoke the spirits of my dread clan.

777
00:38:08,189 --> 00:38:10,373
By Cerberus and Ball.

778
00:38:10,373 --> 00:38:12,801
I give thee this sacrifice,

779
00:38:12,801 --> 00:38:14,459
the blood of two innocents.

780
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:17,950
For I am only your
servant upon this earth,

781
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:21,020
and ask of you for your love,

782
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:24,293
and the blessing of your power.

783
00:38:24,293 --> 00:38:26,911
(dramatic music)

784
00:38:26,911 --> 00:38:28,411
Give me the power.

785
00:38:43,977 --> 00:38:46,727
Hello my dear, long, lost Lilith.

786
00:38:48,161 --> 00:38:52,328
- It's nice to see the family
has kept up with tradition.

787
00:38:54,029 --> 00:38:56,846
- Brad, how nice of you to join us.

788
00:38:56,846 --> 00:38:58,263
- Elizabeth, I...

789
00:39:00,324 --> 00:39:03,491
- You're interrupting a family moment.

790
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:07,010
- Who are you?

791
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:14,893
- I'm your destiny, Bard Peyton.

792
00:39:14,893 --> 00:39:18,137
I told your ancestors I would return.

793
00:39:18,137 --> 00:39:19,054
And I have.

794
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:22,607
And I've waited oh so very long,

795
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:25,702
for your kiss.

796
00:39:25,702 --> 00:39:27,719
(thunder cracks)

797
00:39:27,719 --> 00:39:30,886
(loud kissing noises)

798
00:39:33,649 --> 00:39:35,974
(screams and groans)

799
00:39:35,974 --> 00:39:38,641
(evil laughter)

800
00:39:40,023 --> 00:39:42,773
- Ah, the sweet taste of revenge.

801
00:39:46,005 --> 00:39:49,710
(maniacal laughter)

802
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:52,627
Now, go forth and claim your prize.

803
00:39:56,077 --> 00:39:57,744
My beloved ancestor.

804
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:08,285
- Oh this is weird.

805
00:40:08,285 --> 00:40:09,348
- What?

806
00:40:09,348 --> 00:40:11,120
- It's a list of names.

807
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:15,287
Goodman Darrow, Goodman
Meeredith, Goodman Salisbury,

808
00:40:16,208 --> 00:40:17,375
Goodman Smith.

809
00:40:18,679 --> 00:40:19,512
- So?

810
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:24,638
- So, all these guys have
the same last names as us.

811
00:40:24,638 --> 00:40:26,170
Well most of us,

812
00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:28,940
I mean I don't see your last
name listed on here anywhere.

813
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:31,346
- Maybe it's a condescension.

814
00:40:31,346 --> 00:40:32,903
- What does Goodman mean anyway?

815
00:40:32,903 --> 00:40:33,965
- Goodman?

816
00:40:33,965 --> 00:40:35,880
Well Goodman was sort of like mister.

817
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:38,642
Back in the early 15, 1600s.

818
00:40:38,642 --> 00:40:40,365
Totally an anglo endearment.

819
00:40:40,365 --> 00:40:43,115
It's basically a term of respect.

820
00:40:44,863 --> 00:40:47,446
I told you I'm a history major.

821
00:40:48,367 --> 00:40:51,347
(thunder cracks)

822
00:40:51,347 --> 00:40:53,930
(spooky music)

823
00:40:59,305 --> 00:41:03,472
(thunder rolls into the distance)

824
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:15,620
(bed creaks softly)

825
00:41:22,392 --> 00:41:24,817
- What about those names?

826
00:41:24,817 --> 00:41:26,636
- Well are you originally from Dunwich?

827
00:41:26,636 --> 00:41:29,275
Or did you move here from someplace else?

828
00:41:29,275 --> 00:41:31,564
- Well I was born in Boston,

829
00:41:31,564 --> 00:41:34,343
but both my folks were
originally from here,

830
00:41:34,343 --> 00:41:37,644
and then they moved back
when I was about five.

831
00:41:37,644 --> 00:41:39,481
They liked the area.

832
00:41:39,481 --> 00:41:42,148
- Then you know what, I bet if
you asked Scott, Janet, Marie

833
00:41:42,148 --> 00:41:45,324
or anybody else they'll
tell you the same thing.

834
00:41:45,324 --> 00:41:49,520
You guys are direct descendants
of these witch hunters.

835
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:52,680
- So, essentially what
we're dealing with here

836
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:57,536
is some really nice girl, maybe
a little on the spacey side,

837
00:41:57,536 --> 00:42:01,285
somebody we all like, who just
out of the clear blue sky,

838
00:42:01,285 --> 00:42:05,031
decides to have a party 300
years after her ancestor dies,

839
00:42:05,031 --> 00:42:07,566
and just happens to invite all
the descendants of the guys

840
00:42:07,566 --> 00:42:08,816
who killed her?

841
00:42:09,847 --> 00:42:11,514
- Essentially, yeah.

842
00:42:17,263 --> 00:42:19,856
(hisses)

843
00:42:19,856 --> 00:42:20,959
Do you think she knew all this

844
00:42:20,959 --> 00:42:22,109
when she invited you guys here?

845
00:42:22,109 --> 00:42:24,048
- Of course she knew.

846
00:42:24,048 --> 00:42:26,288
I mean I don't know how you
guys wound up with an invite,

847
00:42:26,288 --> 00:42:28,480
but when she invited me, Scott, and Maria,

848
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,896
she was very specific about who we were.

849
00:42:30,896 --> 00:42:33,484
Made sure to mention our
last names and everything.

850
00:42:33,484 --> 00:42:35,351
Even though we've pretty
much known her forever.

851
00:42:35,351 --> 00:42:37,801
- You know, this could
still just be a coincidence.

852
00:42:37,801 --> 00:42:39,788
Or maybe it's part of her jokes.

853
00:42:39,788 --> 00:42:42,391
She's certainly got a twisted
enough sense of humor.

854
00:42:42,391 --> 00:42:44,745
- Yeah well Goodman Banbridge
wasn't mentioned in that

855
00:42:44,745 --> 00:42:46,576
edict thingy we were reading earlier,

856
00:42:46,576 --> 00:42:48,242
so you're not part of this.

857
00:42:48,242 --> 00:42:49,611
Why were you invited?

858
00:42:49,611 --> 00:42:51,477
- Like I said, coincidence.

859
00:42:51,477 --> 00:42:54,292
- See this is just too
perfect to be some coincidence

860
00:42:54,292 --> 00:42:55,566
or accident.

861
00:42:55,566 --> 00:42:56,586
Maybe you got an invite

862
00:42:56,586 --> 00:42:58,740
just to throw the rest
of us off the trail.

863
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:00,591
- You know what, she
could be up to anything.

864
00:43:00,591 --> 00:43:01,643
And I mean anything from,

865
00:43:01,643 --> 00:43:03,138
surprise the lights are all off,

866
00:43:03,138 --> 00:43:04,493
we could just stumble around in the dark

867
00:43:04,493 --> 00:43:06,693
in a big ole spooky
house, pissing our pants,

868
00:43:06,693 --> 00:43:11,050
right up to spiking the booze
and pushing us off the roof.

869
00:43:11,050 --> 00:43:13,264
- Where is Elizabeth anyway?

870
00:43:13,264 --> 00:43:14,886
Maybe we should just go find her.

871
00:43:14,886 --> 00:43:16,288
- Are you sure you want to do that?

872
00:43:16,288 --> 00:43:19,029
What about everybody else?

873
00:43:19,029 --> 00:43:22,842
- I just wanted to study for
my applied sciences final.

874
00:43:22,842 --> 00:43:24,308
(suspenseful music)

875
00:43:24,308 --> 00:43:26,471
(heart beat in background)

876
00:43:26,471 --> 00:43:29,221
(water dripping)

877
00:43:33,795 --> 00:43:37,628
(music slowly increases pace)

878
00:43:47,890 --> 00:43:51,144
- It's your destiny, Marie Darrow.

879
00:43:51,144 --> 00:43:52,894
You pay for the past.

880
00:43:53,866 --> 00:43:56,033
(screams)

881
00:43:57,947 --> 00:43:59,220
- What was that?

882
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:00,420
- I don't know, it sure didn't sound good,

883
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:02,386
whatever it was.

884
00:44:02,386 --> 00:44:03,420
- You got to be kidding me.

885
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:04,253
That's like the screamer

886
00:44:04,253 --> 00:44:06,687
from haunted house sounds volume one.

887
00:44:06,687 --> 00:44:08,210
Lame.

888
00:44:08,210 --> 00:44:10,325
- Dude, dude are you sure?

889
00:44:10,325 --> 00:44:12,551
That sounded like the real deal to me.

890
00:44:12,551 --> 00:44:14,606
- Well the only way it
could have been real, Tony

891
00:44:14,606 --> 00:44:17,659
if it's the freaking cheerleader
getting porked upstairs.

892
00:44:17,659 --> 00:44:20,567
And that one kind of sounded
like she was faking it, huh?

893
00:44:20,567 --> 00:44:23,503
- Well ain't Maria's usual
line like tackle men cowboy

894
00:44:23,503 --> 00:44:24,798
when her and Scott are going at it?

895
00:44:24,798 --> 00:44:26,132
And that was not it.

896
00:44:26,132 --> 00:44:28,646
- I ain't exactly keeping score here.

897
00:44:28,646 --> 00:44:29,989
- Alright well let's say it's not like

898
00:44:29,989 --> 00:44:31,907
two people having sex, then what?

899
00:44:31,907 --> 00:44:34,700
- Well gee, let's just say
that a big plastic pirate

900
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:38,109
skeleton out in the hall way
isn't from Wal-Mart either.

901
00:44:38,109 --> 00:44:39,672
Come on Tony, it's all a big set up.

902
00:44:39,672 --> 00:44:40,871
Don't you see?

903
00:44:40,871 --> 00:44:44,035
I know Elizabeth and this is
one of her not so funny jokes.

904
00:44:44,035 --> 00:44:45,630
You know what's going to happen next?

905
00:44:45,630 --> 00:44:47,837
Somebody is going to pop
out with a Bbogeyman mask

906
00:44:47,837 --> 00:44:49,301
and yell trick-or-treat.

907
00:44:49,301 --> 00:44:51,468
- Did you want to go home?

908
00:44:52,545 --> 00:44:54,811
- Well I'd rather stay with you.

909
00:44:54,811 --> 00:44:56,061
If that's okay?

910
00:44:57,664 --> 00:44:59,686
- That's more than okay.

911
00:44:59,686 --> 00:45:01,984
(soft gentle music)

912
00:45:01,984 --> 00:45:04,420
- You know back in progressive psych class

913
00:45:04,420 --> 00:45:08,085
I'd catch you looking at me sometimes.

914
00:45:08,085 --> 00:45:09,045
- Really?

915
00:45:09,045 --> 00:45:11,056
- I mean I never knew
why you were doing it.

916
00:45:11,056 --> 00:45:13,795
I never actually though you
liked me or anything like that.

917
00:45:13,795 --> 00:45:14,628
- Why not?

918
00:45:16,209 --> 00:45:19,373
- I just don't think of myself like that.

919
00:45:19,373 --> 00:45:23,358
Not like most girls, I don't
think I'm very attractive.

920
00:45:23,358 --> 00:45:24,191
- Hey,

921
00:45:25,049 --> 00:45:26,481
look,

922
00:45:26,481 --> 00:45:29,228
I'm just some guy, okay?

923
00:45:29,228 --> 00:45:31,047
I'd be willing to bet there's
a ton of guys out there

924
00:45:31,047 --> 00:45:33,587
who'd find you attractive.

925
00:45:33,587 --> 00:45:35,504
- Well where you going?

926
00:45:37,007 --> 00:45:38,385
- Well it's been real,

927
00:45:38,385 --> 00:45:39,409
it's been fun,

928
00:45:39,409 --> 00:45:41,928
but it ain't been real
fun, you know what I mean?

929
00:45:41,928 --> 00:45:44,840
I think it's time to let
the air out of this shindig.

930
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:46,831
- Well what about Jack?

931
00:45:46,831 --> 00:45:47,800
- Jack is probably going to make it

932
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:49,653
with little miss wallflower tonight.

933
00:45:49,653 --> 00:45:51,516
- No, Jack was our ride out here tonight.

934
00:45:51,516 --> 00:45:53,241
We don't find him, we don't get home.

935
00:45:53,241 --> 00:45:54,905
- Shit.

936
00:45:54,905 --> 00:45:57,175
- Well where do you think he is?

937
00:45:57,175 --> 00:45:58,008
- I don't know.

938
00:45:58,008 --> 00:45:58,969
If he's smart he probably got the room

939
00:45:58,969 --> 00:46:00,781
next to Scott and Maria.

940
00:46:00,781 --> 00:46:01,764
- Dude, I'm serious.

941
00:46:01,764 --> 00:46:04,092
I don't know my way around
creepy castle, do you?

942
00:46:04,092 --> 00:46:05,128
- No.

943
00:46:05,128 --> 00:46:06,194
But we're just going
to have to walk around

944
00:46:06,194 --> 00:46:09,962
until we bump into Scott
and Maria, Jack, somebody.

945
00:46:09,962 --> 00:46:12,074
- Well about the names in that book then?

946
00:46:12,074 --> 00:46:14,167
- Oh, Lizzy gets a wild hair up her ass,

947
00:46:14,167 --> 00:46:15,796
invites the descendants of the guys

948
00:46:15,796 --> 00:46:17,835
that burnt up that ancestor of hers?

949
00:46:17,835 --> 00:46:19,234
Yeah, right.

950
00:46:19,234 --> 00:46:20,087
I mean this whole thing sounds

951
00:46:20,087 --> 00:46:21,597
like a big load of crap to me.

952
00:46:21,597 --> 00:46:23,574
I mean look how long it
took for her to put up

953
00:46:23,574 --> 00:46:25,305
creepy castle here.

954
00:46:25,305 --> 00:46:26,928
Think about it, Tony.

955
00:46:26,928 --> 00:46:28,650
She's got us all out here while her folks

956
00:46:28,650 --> 00:46:30,564
are off in Switzerland or whatever,

957
00:46:30,564 --> 00:46:33,234
and she's got this big plan
to freak everybody out.

958
00:46:33,234 --> 00:46:35,616
- Man, she's a real bitch.

959
00:46:35,616 --> 00:46:37,690
- No, you're just a brain dead drug addict

960
00:46:37,690 --> 00:46:40,020
who would fall for something like this.

961
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:40,853
Witches?

962
00:46:40,853 --> 00:46:41,686
(scoffs)

963
00:46:41,686 --> 00:46:43,157
Jesus.

964
00:46:43,157 --> 00:46:44,721
(thunder cracks)

965
00:46:44,721 --> 00:46:46,721
- I ain't a drug addict.

966
00:46:49,132 --> 00:46:50,667
(soft romantic music)

967
00:46:50,667 --> 00:46:52,543
- You should look at yourself sometime.

968
00:46:52,543 --> 00:46:53,524
(giggles)

969
00:46:53,524 --> 00:46:55,802
- I can't see without my glasses.

970
00:46:55,802 --> 00:46:58,557
- You have incredible eyes, Jennifer.

971
00:46:58,557 --> 00:46:59,390
- Really?

972
00:47:01,033 --> 00:47:03,366
- Goes with the rest of you.

973
00:47:04,612 --> 00:47:06,184
What?

974
00:47:06,184 --> 00:47:08,157
(giggles)

975
00:47:08,157 --> 00:47:09,151
- I'm sorry, Jack.

976
00:47:09,151 --> 00:47:09,984
I'm sorry.

977
00:47:10,862 --> 00:47:13,703
That was a pretty cheesy
line, you have to admit it.

978
00:47:13,703 --> 00:47:15,755
- You thought it was cheesy?

979
00:47:15,755 --> 00:47:17,422
- Just a little bit.

980
00:47:18,742 --> 00:47:21,575
- Well, what's a good line to use?

981
00:47:22,743 --> 00:47:25,493
- How about, I like you Jennifer.

982
00:47:26,874 --> 00:47:29,225
And I would like to
get to know you better.

983
00:47:29,225 --> 00:47:31,367
(chuckles)

984
00:47:31,367 --> 00:47:33,700
- And that one's not cheesy?

985
00:47:34,654 --> 00:47:36,987
- Shut up and kiss me, Jack.

986
00:47:38,217 --> 00:47:39,717
- That one's good.

987
00:47:43,603 --> 00:47:45,021
(pop)

988
00:47:45,021 --> 00:47:46,729
- What happened to the lights?

989
00:47:46,729 --> 00:47:47,729
- Looked like a power surge

990
00:47:47,729 --> 00:47:49,730
with the bulbs popping like that.

991
00:47:49,730 --> 00:47:51,725
An old house like this
has really shitty wiring.

992
00:47:51,725 --> 00:47:53,364
Probably an old kicker box from the 50s

993
00:47:53,364 --> 00:47:55,215
instead of a transformer.

994
00:47:55,215 --> 00:47:56,268
Instead of blowing a fuse,

995
00:47:56,268 --> 00:47:58,137
the breaker probably kicked off.

996
00:47:58,137 --> 00:47:59,199
- Great.

997
00:47:59,199 --> 00:48:00,565
- You know we should really find everybody

998
00:48:00,565 --> 00:48:01,654
and get out of here.

999
00:48:01,654 --> 00:48:04,489
I think this party died an
unatural death about an hour ago.

1000
00:48:04,489 --> 00:48:05,769
- Do you think everybody is okay?

1001
00:48:05,769 --> 00:48:08,095
- Well yeah, you know unless
Tony finally went section eight

1002
00:48:08,095 --> 00:48:09,644
and offed everybody with an Uzi.

1003
00:48:09,644 --> 00:48:10,879
I don't see why not.

1004
00:48:10,879 --> 00:48:12,468
- What about that scream we just heard?

1005
00:48:12,468 --> 00:48:14,168
- I was just hoping that
we me mistaking someones

1006
00:48:14,168 --> 00:48:18,335
bad singing for a blood
curdling shriek or something.

1007
00:48:19,978 --> 00:48:21,228
Right, come on.

1008
00:48:25,064 --> 00:48:27,488
- What the hell happened
to the power in this joint?

1009
00:48:27,488 --> 00:48:28,778
- Dude I don't know.

1010
00:48:28,778 --> 00:48:30,616
But this is the part of the
movie where that hilljack

1011
00:48:30,616 --> 00:48:32,778
starts whacking up kids with an ax.

1012
00:48:32,778 --> 00:48:34,727
- Hands off, Tony.

1013
00:48:34,727 --> 00:48:36,260
- I'm afraid of the dark.

1014
00:48:36,260 --> 00:48:39,518
- It's not dark, look there's
candles and stuff, see.

1015
00:48:39,518 --> 00:48:41,432
- Oh yeah, that's a whole lot better.

1016
00:48:41,432 --> 00:48:43,376
- What I want to know is
where's our football player

1017
00:48:43,376 --> 00:48:44,959
pal and his girl toy?

1018
00:48:44,959 --> 00:48:46,114
I'm for calling it a night,

1019
00:48:46,114 --> 00:48:49,071
and I ain't too keen on leaving
anybody behind when I split.

1020
00:48:49,071 --> 00:48:51,457
This is so called party, is bad news.

1021
00:48:51,457 --> 00:48:53,522
- Dude if Elizabeth called
a taxi then we should stay

1022
00:48:53,522 --> 00:48:56,318
right here before it comes
so everyone can hitch a ride

1023
00:48:56,318 --> 00:48:57,630
out of here together, alright?

1024
00:48:57,630 --> 00:48:59,248
- Oh, here's a question.

1025
00:48:59,248 --> 00:49:01,137
So where did Stevie Nicks tra-la-la off

1026
00:49:01,137 --> 00:49:02,929
after she left us in that room?

1027
00:49:02,929 --> 00:49:06,512
How long does it take
to call a cab anyway?

1028
00:49:08,005 --> 00:49:11,172
It's a rhetorical question, goof ball.

1029
00:49:12,230 --> 00:49:14,272
- I don't know what that means.

1030
00:49:14,272 --> 00:49:18,439
- It means just shut the hell
up and follow me, alright?

1031
00:49:22,027 --> 00:49:22,860
Scott?

1032
00:49:23,764 --> 00:49:24,597
Maria?

1033
00:49:25,438 --> 00:49:26,876
Jackie, Brad?

1034
00:49:26,876 --> 00:49:29,543
Any fucking body it's me, Janet.

1035
00:49:31,623 --> 00:49:33,956
Alright fine, I'm coming in.

1036
00:49:35,194 --> 00:49:37,913
(thunder rolls into the distance)

1037
00:49:37,913 --> 00:49:39,412
Oops.

1038
00:49:39,412 --> 00:49:40,995
- Dude, what is it?

1039
00:49:42,986 --> 00:49:45,739
(chuckles)

1040
00:49:45,739 --> 00:49:47,605
- Hey Scottie, Maria,

1041
00:49:47,605 --> 00:49:49,563
sorry for busting in on you two like that,

1042
00:49:49,563 --> 00:49:52,136
but Tony and I are gonna make
like a baby and head out.

1043
00:49:52,136 --> 00:49:53,890
So get your God damn clothes on,

1044
00:49:53,890 --> 00:49:55,430
and we can all do it together.

1045
00:49:55,430 --> 00:49:58,351
(thunder cracks)

1046
00:49:58,351 --> 00:49:59,184
Come one you two.

1047
00:49:59,184 --> 00:50:00,675
I'm all about sex 24 hours a day,

1048
00:50:00,675 --> 00:50:01,731
but now ain't the time,

1049
00:50:01,731 --> 00:50:03,146
and it sure as hell ain't the place.

1050
00:50:03,146 --> 00:50:05,550
(thunder cracks)

1051
00:50:05,550 --> 00:50:06,552
Alright fine.

1052
00:50:06,552 --> 00:50:10,625
But we're coming back for you
guys after we find the others.

1053
00:50:10,625 --> 00:50:11,458
- So um,

1054
00:50:12,596 --> 00:50:15,246
what exactly was going on in there?

1055
00:50:15,246 --> 00:50:16,496
I mean did you,

1056
00:50:17,346 --> 00:50:19,504
see anybody's breasts?

1057
00:50:19,504 --> 00:50:20,337
- What do I look like?

1058
00:50:20,337 --> 00:50:21,581
Penthouse forum?

1059
00:50:21,581 --> 00:50:23,824
Just shut up and help me
find Jack and Jennifer.

1060
00:50:23,824 --> 00:50:24,908
There's got to be someone in this place

1061
00:50:24,908 --> 00:50:26,103
who ain't getting it on.

1062
00:50:26,103 --> 00:50:28,853
(thunder cracks)

1063
00:50:29,895 --> 00:50:31,368
(dramatic music)

1064
00:50:31,368 --> 00:50:33,951
(low growling)

1065
00:50:41,063 --> 00:50:42,219
- Did everybody go home?

1066
00:50:42,219 --> 00:50:43,733
- I don't know.

1067
00:50:43,733 --> 00:50:44,892
- I thought the power was off?

1068
00:50:44,892 --> 00:50:45,725
- It is.

1069
00:50:49,089 --> 00:50:50,193
- Well what do you need that for?

1070
00:50:50,193 --> 00:50:51,968
- I'm liking this less
and less by the second.

1071
00:50:51,968 --> 00:50:52,925
- Yeah, well maybe it's
more of Elizabeth's

1072
00:50:52,925 --> 00:50:54,126
quote, unquote jokes.

1073
00:50:54,126 --> 00:50:55,049
- Yeah.

1074
00:50:55,049 --> 00:50:55,882
Ha ha.

1075
00:50:55,882 --> 00:50:57,869
This is a laugh riot.

1076
00:50:57,869 --> 00:50:59,359
Janet.

1077
00:50:59,359 --> 00:51:00,800
Tony?

1078
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:01,633
You guys?

1079
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:04,911
- You know, I just keep
getting this picture in my head

1080
00:51:04,911 --> 00:51:06,677
that everybody is waiting
behind a door or something.

1081
00:51:06,677 --> 00:51:08,343
Right? I mean, they're
all going to jump out

1082
00:51:08,343 --> 00:51:09,176
and yell surprise, right?

1083
00:51:09,176 --> 00:51:10,440
- Yeah, well I can tell
you at this point if they

1084
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:11,396
pull something like that on us,

1085
00:51:11,396 --> 00:51:14,578
I'm going to beat them to death with this.

1086
00:51:14,578 --> 00:51:16,976
- [Demonic Disembodied Voice] Jack.

1087
00:51:16,976 --> 00:51:17,809
- Come on.

1088
00:51:17,809 --> 00:51:18,642
I mean it's one of her jokes.

1089
00:51:18,642 --> 00:51:19,475
It has to be.

1090
00:51:19,475 --> 00:51:20,947
- Yeah well, this joke
stuff is getting real old,

1091
00:51:20,947 --> 00:51:22,546
real God damn quick.

1092
00:51:22,546 --> 00:51:24,754
- What are we going to do, Jack?

1093
00:51:24,754 --> 00:51:25,689
- We'll hide into the foyer.

1094
00:51:25,689 --> 00:51:26,906
If we don't run into anybody there,

1095
00:51:26,906 --> 00:51:28,432
then I say we ditch these loosers,

1096
00:51:28,432 --> 00:51:29,994
and go and catch the
late show or something.

1097
00:51:29,994 --> 00:51:31,364
That'll fix their asses.

1098
00:51:31,364 --> 00:51:32,805
- Ordinarily I'd say that's pretty mean,

1099
00:51:32,805 --> 00:51:34,424
but I think under the circumstances.

1100
00:51:34,424 --> 00:51:35,257
- Come on.

1101
00:51:35,257 --> 00:51:37,462
- I'm right behind you.

1102
00:51:37,462 --> 00:51:40,212
(dramatic music)

1103
00:51:43,166 --> 00:51:45,916
(thunder cracks)

1104
00:51:52,779 --> 00:51:56,446
(soft female voice singing)

1105
00:51:57,315 --> 00:51:59,849
- Are you crashing my party?

1106
00:51:59,849 --> 00:52:01,855
(thunder cracks repeatedly)

1107
00:52:01,855 --> 00:52:04,272
(low growls)

1108
00:52:06,907 --> 00:52:10,110
(lightening hisses)

1109
00:52:10,110 --> 00:52:12,592
(dramatic music)

1110
00:52:12,592 --> 00:52:16,279
(maniacal laughter)

1111
00:52:16,279 --> 00:52:18,696
(low growls)

1112
00:52:47,015 --> 00:52:50,182
(body thuds to floor)

1113
00:52:55,654 --> 00:52:56,860
- Tony.

1114
00:52:56,860 --> 00:52:58,138
Are you alright?

1115
00:52:58,138 --> 00:52:59,491
- Yeah dude.

1116
00:52:59,491 --> 00:53:00,324
I'm great.

1117
00:53:01,671 --> 00:53:05,192
I don't think you want to know
what I just did to my pants.

1118
00:53:05,192 --> 00:53:06,233
What happened to that--

1119
00:53:06,233 --> 00:53:08,353
- I cold cocked her, and
locked her in that room.

1120
00:53:08,353 --> 00:53:09,898
So we're cool.

1121
00:53:09,898 --> 00:53:11,944
- I want to know what the
hell's going on around here.

1122
00:53:11,944 --> 00:53:13,725
Was that, that thing that we just saw,

1123
00:53:13,725 --> 00:53:15,544
that Lilith chick Elizabeth
was talking about,

1124
00:53:15,544 --> 00:53:16,435
or what?

1125
00:53:16,435 --> 00:53:18,439
- Well what do you think?

1126
00:53:18,439 --> 00:53:19,689
- I don't know.

1127
00:53:20,664 --> 00:53:23,716
No, no, no, this ain't happening.

1128
00:53:23,716 --> 00:53:25,238
- Well I definitely think
we're dealing with something

1129
00:53:25,238 --> 00:53:27,128
outside the God damn norm.

1130
00:53:27,128 --> 00:53:28,324
Did you see her face,

1131
00:53:28,324 --> 00:53:30,106
and hear that voice?

1132
00:53:30,106 --> 00:53:31,443
This ain't no joke.

1133
00:53:31,443 --> 00:53:33,274
That's a God damn exorcist.

1134
00:53:33,274 --> 00:53:35,262
- Well what are we going
to do about it, alright?

1135
00:53:35,262 --> 00:53:37,314
We don't have any holy water or nothing.

1136
00:53:37,314 --> 00:53:38,601
- Alright.

1137
00:53:38,601 --> 00:53:40,649
I want you to go back there
and get Scot and Maria.

1138
00:53:40,649 --> 00:53:41,615
Now I'm going to go downstairs

1139
00:53:41,615 --> 00:53:43,419
and see if I can find anybody else.

1140
00:53:43,419 --> 00:53:45,170
And after that, we're going to vamoose.

1141
00:53:45,170 --> 00:53:46,894
Any objections?

1142
00:53:46,894 --> 00:53:50,346
- I'll eat my way out
of here if I have too.

1143
00:53:50,346 --> 00:53:53,660
(suspenseful music)

1144
00:53:53,660 --> 00:53:54,493
- Hello?

1145
00:53:55,684 --> 00:53:57,236
Anybody here?

1146
00:53:57,236 --> 00:53:58,673
- No need to shout.

1147
00:53:58,673 --> 00:53:59,966
- Jesus, don't do that.

1148
00:53:59,966 --> 00:54:01,133
- Whoa, Conan.

1149
00:54:02,090 --> 00:54:03,072
It's okay.

1150
00:54:03,072 --> 00:54:05,542
I'm not packing any heat.

1151
00:54:05,542 --> 00:54:07,134
- Sorry.

1152
00:54:07,134 --> 00:54:09,398
I'm just a little edgy at the moment.

1153
00:54:09,398 --> 00:54:10,811
- What the hell happened to the power?

1154
00:54:10,811 --> 00:54:14,128
I've been looking for a
fuse box for like hours now.

1155
00:54:14,128 --> 00:54:16,849
- We thought you turned
it off to scare everybody.

1156
00:54:16,849 --> 00:54:20,541
- I did all of this
just to scare you guys?

1157
00:54:20,541 --> 00:54:23,799
I'm twisted, but I'm
not quite that twisted.

1158
00:54:23,799 --> 00:54:24,937
- Did you happen to see anybody else

1159
00:54:24,937 --> 00:54:26,669
when you were walking around?

1160
00:54:26,669 --> 00:54:28,233
- Well I think I saw Janet and Tony

1161
00:54:28,233 --> 00:54:30,280
running around somewhere.

1162
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:31,113
- Really?

1163
00:54:32,987 --> 00:54:37,208
- Well, look Elizabeth
I hate to do this but,

1164
00:54:37,208 --> 00:54:39,126
I think it's time for us to split.

1165
00:54:39,126 --> 00:54:40,097
Do you know where everybody is,

1166
00:54:40,097 --> 00:54:41,156
because we got a group together

1167
00:54:41,156 --> 00:54:44,541
so everybody can get a ride home.

1168
00:54:44,541 --> 00:54:45,374
Elizabeth?

1169
00:54:46,787 --> 00:54:50,131
- I have someone I want you to meet.

1170
00:54:50,131 --> 00:54:50,964
- What?

1171
00:54:52,548 --> 00:54:54,798
- Guys, meet Lilith Le Fay.

1172
00:54:56,032 --> 00:55:00,211
Remember I was telling
you about her earlier.

1173
00:55:00,211 --> 00:55:04,099
- Nobody is going to
leave my little party.

1174
00:55:04,099 --> 00:55:07,766
I'm your destiny, your
curse, nobody leaves.

1175
00:55:10,649 --> 00:55:12,066
You are all mine.

1176
00:55:14,941 --> 00:55:15,774
- Get away from me.

1177
00:55:15,774 --> 00:55:16,607
God.

1178
00:55:19,692 --> 00:55:20,539
- Our father who art in heaven,

1179
00:55:20,539 --> 00:55:21,645
hollowed be thy name.

1180
00:55:21,645 --> 00:55:22,771
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done,

1181
00:55:22,771 --> 00:55:24,373
on earth as it is in heaven.

1182
00:55:24,373 --> 00:55:25,557
Give us this day our daily bread,

1183
00:55:25,557 --> 00:55:26,748
and forgive us our trespasses,

1184
00:55:26,748 --> 00:55:29,948
as we forgive those who
trespass against us.

1185
00:55:29,948 --> 00:55:32,413
(maniacal laughter)

1186
00:55:32,413 --> 00:55:36,664
- My god is far older
than yours, little boy.

1187
00:55:36,664 --> 00:55:39,268
- That won't help you for long, Jackie.

1188
00:55:39,268 --> 00:55:41,782
You know that, don't you?

1189
00:55:41,782 --> 00:55:44,001
- How'd you know how to
do that with the cross?

1190
00:55:44,001 --> 00:55:44,834
- I don't know.

1191
00:55:44,834 --> 00:55:45,667
Seemed like the right thing,

1192
00:55:45,667 --> 00:55:46,500
I was raised catholic.

1193
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:47,407
What can I say?

1194
00:55:47,407 --> 00:55:49,335
- Okay, so what the hell do we do now?

1195
00:55:49,335 --> 00:55:50,585
- I'm thinking,

1196
00:55:51,481 --> 00:55:52,314
run.

1197
00:55:53,621 --> 00:55:55,014
Fucking terrific.

1198
00:55:55,014 --> 00:55:55,847
- What was that?

1199
00:55:55,847 --> 00:55:56,680
A Halloween mask?

1200
00:55:56,680 --> 00:55:57,513
- Hey I trick-or-treat.

1201
00:55:57,513 --> 00:55:58,965
I think that was the real deal, folks.

1202
00:55:58,965 --> 00:56:00,281
- No it's nothing like that.

1203
00:56:00,281 --> 00:56:01,223
It can't be.

1204
00:56:01,223 --> 00:56:03,077
Maybe there's a legitimate
explanation for all this.

1205
00:56:03,077 --> 00:56:04,949
I mean maybe she got the
whole place rigged like

1206
00:56:04,949 --> 00:56:06,067
a haunted house or some shit,

1207
00:56:06,067 --> 00:56:07,848
and she's just setting
us up for something bad.

1208
00:56:07,848 --> 00:56:08,751
- We'll figure it out later.

1209
00:56:08,751 --> 00:56:11,060
Come on, keep running.

1210
00:56:11,060 --> 00:56:13,472
- Run all you want, Jack Smith.

1211
00:56:13,472 --> 00:56:15,947
But you won't get far.

1212
00:56:15,947 --> 00:56:17,984
Because this is my house,

1213
00:56:17,984 --> 00:56:20,630
and the door won't open again
until my family gets it's

1214
00:56:20,630 --> 00:56:22,900
revenge upon you all.

1215
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:24,151
- Scotty?

1216
00:56:24,151 --> 00:56:27,214
Marie, are you guys okay in there?

1217
00:56:27,214 --> 00:56:28,635
Okay dudes, I can dig it if you cats

1218
00:56:28,635 --> 00:56:31,350
all want to do the marathon sex thing.

1219
00:56:31,350 --> 00:56:32,754
But it's real dark and scary out here,

1220
00:56:32,754 --> 00:56:34,809
and there's this demon chick after us,

1221
00:56:34,809 --> 00:56:35,984
and Janet wants us all to split,

1222
00:56:35,984 --> 00:56:39,412
or she's going to kick my ass sideways.

1223
00:56:39,412 --> 00:56:43,127
Oh, and I gotta pee really bad, too.

1224
00:56:43,127 --> 00:56:45,344
- [Maria] It's okay Tony,
we're getting dressed.

1225
00:56:45,344 --> 00:56:46,687
Come right on it.

1226
00:56:46,687 --> 00:56:47,860
- Yo.

1227
00:56:47,860 --> 00:56:50,894
(suspenseful music)

1228
00:56:50,894 --> 00:56:51,727
Hey dudes.

1229
00:56:52,782 --> 00:56:54,282
You want to party?

1230
00:56:55,387 --> 00:56:57,461
- It is party time, Tony.

1231
00:56:57,461 --> 00:56:59,705
- Don't loose your head.

1232
00:56:59,705 --> 00:57:01,872
(screams)

1233
00:57:04,496 --> 00:57:05,555
- Shit!

1234
00:57:05,555 --> 00:57:07,012
What's happening?

1235
00:57:07,012 --> 00:57:08,214
- It's Elizabeth.

1236
00:57:08,214 --> 00:57:09,228
- There's thing thing,

1237
00:57:09,228 --> 00:57:10,211
I mean it, it, it just came out of her.

1238
00:57:10,211 --> 00:57:11,366
- It's Lilith Le Fay.

1239
00:57:11,366 --> 00:57:12,199
- Like how?

1240
00:57:12,199 --> 00:57:13,098
- Who gives a shit like how.

1241
00:57:13,098 --> 00:57:14,250
Just is.

1242
00:57:14,250 --> 00:57:16,080
We've got to find the
others and pull out of here.

1243
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:18,298
Look, whatever this
chick is, or she ain't.

1244
00:57:18,298 --> 00:57:20,416
This one mean mother that
just pop out at me and Tony

1245
00:57:20,416 --> 00:57:21,524
like she just did.

1246
00:57:21,524 --> 00:57:23,706
So we're going for the
door, and we're going now.

1247
00:57:23,706 --> 00:57:25,651
And when we're about 90
miles away from this place,

1248
00:57:25,651 --> 00:57:27,272
we can try and explain to the cops.

1249
00:57:27,272 --> 00:57:28,105
- No good.

1250
00:57:28,105 --> 00:57:29,176
Elizabeth is down by the door right now.

1251
00:57:29,176 --> 00:57:31,004
We gotta find another way out.

1252
00:57:31,004 --> 00:57:32,211
- How about a window?

1253
00:57:32,211 --> 00:57:33,268
- Also no good.

1254
00:57:33,268 --> 00:57:35,405
This place is locked up like Fort Knox.

1255
00:57:35,405 --> 00:57:37,677
It'll take a Mack tuck to get
through those security bars.

1256
00:57:37,677 --> 00:57:39,564
- Do you think all the windows
in the house are like that?

1257
00:57:39,564 --> 00:57:40,397
- With our luck,

1258
00:57:40,397 --> 00:57:41,600
yeah.

1259
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:45,475
- Oh God guys, this is really bleeding.

1260
00:57:45,475 --> 00:57:48,375
- Got yourself a genuine
battle scar there, Cinderella.

1261
00:57:48,375 --> 00:57:49,209
It's not deep though.

1262
00:57:49,209 --> 00:57:50,365
It just looks bad.

1263
00:57:50,365 --> 00:57:52,043
- There has to be another way out of here.

1264
00:57:52,043 --> 00:57:53,798
I mean a back door, something.

1265
00:57:53,798 --> 00:57:55,536
- We don't know our way around this place.

1266
00:57:55,536 --> 00:57:57,542
And I don't especially
dig the concept of going

1267
00:57:57,542 --> 00:57:58,992
around and trying to figure it out.

1268
00:57:58,992 --> 00:58:00,141
Do you?

1269
00:58:00,141 --> 00:58:01,383
- How about a phone?

1270
00:58:01,383 --> 00:58:03,155
- I'm thinking no, on that one.

1271
00:58:03,155 --> 00:58:05,331
We got better luck finding
a space ship in this place.

1272
00:58:05,331 --> 00:58:07,247
- Maybe an attic window?

1273
00:58:07,247 --> 00:58:10,274
- I ain't leaving here without Tony.

1274
00:58:10,274 --> 00:58:12,522
(squelching)

1275
00:58:12,522 --> 00:58:15,272
(dramatic music)

1276
00:58:20,123 --> 00:58:21,166
(hissing)

1277
00:58:21,166 --> 00:58:23,899
- [Jennifer] Oh, oh God.

1278
00:58:23,899 --> 00:58:25,864
(low growling)

1279
00:58:25,864 --> 00:58:27,365
- What the hell happened to them?

1280
00:58:27,365 --> 00:58:28,285
- Tell you what,

1281
00:58:28,285 --> 00:58:31,282
you can ask them while
I haul ass out of here.

1282
00:58:31,282 --> 00:58:34,282
(suspenseful music)

1283
00:58:40,763 --> 00:58:42,284
I don't want to just wonder, bitch.

1284
00:58:42,284 --> 00:58:43,479
- Neither do I.

1285
00:58:43,479 --> 00:58:44,817
- Where do you think she is?

1286
00:58:44,817 --> 00:58:45,826
Elizabeth I mean.

1287
00:58:45,826 --> 00:58:46,659
Or Lilith.

1288
00:58:46,659 --> 00:58:50,198
- I don't know, I'm trying
not to think about it.

1289
00:58:50,198 --> 00:58:52,266
- What's wrong, kids?

1290
00:58:52,266 --> 00:58:54,402
Is it the music?

1291
00:58:54,402 --> 00:58:55,819
Not enough booze?

1292
00:58:56,885 --> 00:59:00,033
You guys weren't really
going to leave so soon,

1293
00:59:00,033 --> 00:59:00,866
were you?

1294
00:59:01,787 --> 00:59:05,954
After all, I think it's time
we get this party really going.

1295
00:59:08,621 --> 00:59:11,538
(demonic laughter)

1296
00:59:16,290 --> 00:59:19,040
(water dripping)

1297
00:59:22,459 --> 00:59:24,318
- We're totally screwed.

1298
00:59:24,318 --> 00:59:25,470
- Well if Elizabeth, or Lilith,

1299
00:59:25,470 --> 00:59:27,196
or whats ever left of
our friends don't get us,

1300
00:59:27,196 --> 00:59:29,078
then we'll just end up
dying of starvation.

1301
00:59:29,078 --> 00:59:30,062
Terrific.

1302
00:59:30,062 --> 00:59:31,990
- This place is like a lab.

1303
00:59:31,990 --> 00:59:35,050
- Yeah, or those wacko dungeons
in a Frankenstein flicks.

1304
00:59:35,050 --> 00:59:36,627
- I bet ya this is where
I buddy Liz comes after a

1305
00:59:36,627 --> 00:59:39,286
hard day of yanking out peoples hearts.

1306
00:59:39,286 --> 00:59:40,164
(gasps)

1307
00:59:40,164 --> 00:59:40,997
- Oh God.

1308
00:59:41,883 --> 00:59:43,315
(dramatic music)

1309
00:59:43,315 --> 00:59:45,613
Must have gotten here first.

1310
00:59:45,613 --> 00:59:48,306
- Anne Brown must have found them.

1311
00:59:48,306 --> 00:59:50,458
- I'm not ending up like that.

1312
00:59:50,458 --> 00:59:53,208
(dramatic music)

1313
00:59:56,860 --> 00:59:58,494
Maybe this is that book,

1314
00:59:58,494 --> 01:00:00,516
the one that Elizabeth
was telling us about.

1315
01:00:00,516 --> 01:00:04,183
The one that's like
super evil or something.

1316
01:00:08,107 --> 01:00:08,940
- Ugh.

1317
01:00:10,004 --> 01:00:11,671
Yup, that's the one.

1318
01:00:15,030 --> 01:00:16,499
What are you keeping it for?

1319
01:00:16,499 --> 01:00:18,186
Aren't we in enough trouble?

1320
01:00:18,186 --> 01:00:19,182
- Look maybe we can find out.

1321
01:00:19,182 --> 01:00:20,211
Maybe it'll come in handy.

1322
01:00:20,211 --> 01:00:22,765
Maybe we can use it
against that witch bitch.

1323
01:00:22,765 --> 01:00:24,098
- [Lilith] Jack.

1324
01:00:25,254 --> 01:00:27,078
- Don't, let's stay together.

1325
01:00:27,078 --> 01:00:29,661
(spooky music)

1326
01:00:43,105 --> 01:00:43,938
Janet?

1327
01:00:45,126 --> 01:00:48,469
- How do you like the new improved me?

1328
01:00:48,469 --> 01:00:50,072
- Shit.

1329
01:00:50,072 --> 01:00:52,113
- The party is almost over, Jack.

1330
01:00:52,113 --> 01:00:53,536
So you can either go outside,

1331
01:00:53,536 --> 01:00:56,013
and let Elizabeth and her
friends take care of you.

1332
01:00:56,013 --> 01:00:58,184
Or you can let me play
with you for awhile.

1333
01:00:58,184 --> 01:00:59,319
What do you think?

1334
01:00:59,319 --> 01:01:02,935
- Sister I think you got
some serious fucken problems.

1335
01:01:02,935 --> 01:01:04,685
- So be it tough guy.

1336
01:01:06,833 --> 01:01:08,447
(yells)

1337
01:01:08,447 --> 01:01:11,197
(dramatic music)

1338
01:01:15,018 --> 01:01:17,101
(grunts)

1339
01:01:21,955 --> 01:01:23,478
Oh we don't need that nasty little thing

1340
01:01:23,478 --> 01:01:26,059
to spoil our fun, now do we?

1341
01:01:26,059 --> 01:01:28,809
(dramatic music)

1342
01:01:41,052 --> 01:01:42,660
It's destiny, Jack.

1343
01:01:42,660 --> 01:01:44,993
Sit back and enjoy the ride.

1344
01:01:45,887 --> 01:01:48,637
(dramatic music)

1345
01:01:50,561 --> 01:01:53,394
(demonic yelling)

1346
01:02:02,735 --> 01:02:05,730
(thunder cracks)

1347
01:02:05,730 --> 01:02:07,074
- Can you walk?

1348
01:02:07,074 --> 01:02:09,268
- I might be able to crawl.

1349
01:02:09,268 --> 01:02:13,101
(heart beating in background)

1350
01:02:19,971 --> 01:02:23,696
(suspenseful music)

1351
01:02:23,696 --> 01:02:26,077
- Maybe we could still
make it to the attic.

1352
01:02:26,077 --> 01:02:27,424
- No dice.

1353
01:02:27,424 --> 01:02:28,402
Even if we could get up there,

1354
01:02:28,402 --> 01:02:30,085
there's no way I could climb down

1355
01:02:30,085 --> 01:02:32,752
the side of the house like this.

1356
01:02:40,054 --> 01:02:40,887
(thunder cracks)

1357
01:02:40,887 --> 01:02:41,796
- Jack, I'm worried about you.

1358
01:02:41,796 --> 01:02:44,006
You're loosing a lot of blood.

1359
01:02:44,006 --> 01:02:45,382
- Look,

1360
01:02:45,382 --> 01:02:48,401
there's only one way out of this mess.

1361
01:02:48,401 --> 01:02:50,732
We have to kill Elizabeth.

1362
01:02:50,732 --> 01:02:53,732
- Well that's easier said than done.

1363
01:02:54,750 --> 01:02:57,075
- Maybe, kicker box.

1364
01:02:57,075 --> 01:02:58,670
- Yeah, so?

1365
01:02:58,670 --> 01:02:59,647
You think having the lights on

1366
01:02:59,647 --> 01:03:01,548
is like the least of
our problems right now.

1367
01:03:01,548 --> 01:03:03,609
- No, no I have a plan.

1368
01:03:03,609 --> 01:03:06,079
Look, I need you to cut that wire.

1369
01:03:06,079 --> 01:03:08,892
But make sure it stays
connected to the box.

1370
01:03:08,892 --> 01:03:10,121
Here grab that sword.

1371
01:03:10,121 --> 01:03:10,954
Grab it.

1372
01:03:12,001 --> 01:03:12,834
Good.

1373
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:15,867
Right at the bottom.

1374
01:03:19,545 --> 01:03:20,746
Great, great.

1375
01:03:20,746 --> 01:03:21,579
Okay.

1376
01:03:23,103 --> 01:03:23,936
Alright.

1377
01:03:23,936 --> 01:03:24,769
Good.

1378
01:03:28,799 --> 01:03:31,971
I'm an applied sciences major, right?

1379
01:03:31,971 --> 01:03:36,694
So now it's time to apply
some science to the situation.

1380
01:03:36,694 --> 01:03:38,110
Okay.

1381
01:03:38,110 --> 01:03:39,750
I need you to go over to the kicker box.

1382
01:03:39,750 --> 01:03:40,583
- The kicker box?

1383
01:03:40,583 --> 01:03:41,500
- Yeah, go.

1384
01:03:43,639 --> 01:03:45,053
Now when I say when.

1385
01:03:45,053 --> 01:03:46,370
You pull down on the switch.

1386
01:03:46,370 --> 01:03:47,455
- Jack I still really don't--

1387
01:03:47,455 --> 01:03:48,742
- Just trust me.

1388
01:03:48,742 --> 01:03:49,933
When I tell you too,

1389
01:03:49,933 --> 01:03:52,038
just pull down on that switch.

1390
01:03:52,038 --> 01:03:53,890
- Okay, okay.

1391
01:03:53,890 --> 01:03:54,723
- Okay.

1392
01:03:55,826 --> 01:03:56,659
Elizabeth?

1393
01:03:57,798 --> 01:04:00,014
You around here anywhere?

1394
01:04:00,014 --> 01:04:02,884
You and Lilith might want
to come and check this out.

1395
01:04:02,884 --> 01:04:05,634
(dramatic music)

1396
01:04:10,701 --> 01:04:13,201
- Be careful what you ask for.

1397
01:04:14,195 --> 01:04:15,978
You just might get it.

1398
01:04:15,978 --> 01:04:17,297
- Not so fast.

1399
01:04:17,297 --> 01:04:18,130
You come any closer,

1400
01:04:18,130 --> 01:04:20,119
and I'm going to burn
this little book of yours.

1401
01:04:20,119 --> 01:04:21,889
It would be a real bitch if
you came back from the dead,

1402
01:04:21,889 --> 01:04:23,117
and you couldn't take over the world

1403
01:04:23,117 --> 01:04:25,435
because someone burned your
fucking instruction manual,

1404
01:04:25,435 --> 01:04:26,435
wouldn't it?

1405
01:04:27,687 --> 01:04:30,044
- Oh little Jackie,

1406
01:04:30,044 --> 01:04:33,912
I'm going to certainly save you for last.

1407
01:04:33,912 --> 01:04:36,245
That is most of you, anyway.

1408
01:04:39,237 --> 01:04:42,025
(yells)

1409
01:04:42,025 --> 01:04:44,556
you get an A for effort, Jackie boy.

1410
01:04:44,556 --> 01:04:47,973
But I'm afraid you just don't understand.

1411
01:04:49,090 --> 01:04:51,080
I've been doing this hundreds of years,

1412
01:04:51,080 --> 01:04:53,447
before you were ever born.

1413
01:04:53,447 --> 01:04:55,526
(gags and groans)

1414
01:04:55,526 --> 01:04:57,943
And I will have what is mine.

1415
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:00,753
Oh yes.

1416
01:05:03,970 --> 01:05:06,791
(squelches)

1417
01:05:06,791 --> 01:05:09,541
(dramatic music)

1418
01:05:10,393 --> 01:05:13,393
(hisses and growls)

1419
01:05:18,619 --> 01:05:20,298
What's this?

1420
01:05:20,298 --> 01:05:21,801
- That's what you get
for calling me Jackie,

1421
01:05:21,801 --> 01:05:23,571
you ugly bitch.

1422
01:05:23,571 --> 01:05:24,404
Now!

1423
01:05:25,773 --> 01:05:28,644
(lightening crackles)

1424
01:05:28,644 --> 01:05:31,394
(dramatic music)

1425
01:05:37,315 --> 01:05:39,732
(low growls)

1426
01:05:45,535 --> 01:05:48,202
(moans in pain)

1427
01:06:05,763 --> 01:06:08,096
(explosion)

1428
01:06:17,603 --> 01:06:20,008
- Oh my god, oh my god.

1429
01:06:20,008 --> 01:06:20,841
You okay?

1430
01:06:20,841 --> 01:06:21,674
- I'm okay.

1431
01:06:21,674 --> 01:06:22,659
- You killed her.

1432
01:06:22,659 --> 01:06:23,492
Again.

1433
01:06:24,585 --> 01:06:26,856
But it doesn't matter, you guys.

1434
01:06:26,856 --> 01:06:29,937
She's still going to have
her revenge through me.

1435
01:06:29,937 --> 01:06:32,842
- Don't you know who I am, Elizabeth?

1436
01:06:32,842 --> 01:06:36,048
See I had an ancestor too in Dunwich.

1437
01:06:36,048 --> 01:06:37,627
Remember that child who
almost got sacrificed

1438
01:06:37,627 --> 01:06:39,627
300 years ago by Lilith?

1439
01:06:40,535 --> 01:06:42,277
I'm his descendant.

1440
01:06:42,277 --> 01:06:43,923
- You?

1441
01:06:43,923 --> 01:06:46,392
- No more scarifies, Elizabeth.

1442
01:06:46,392 --> 01:06:48,001
Like your family is so fond of saying,

1443
01:06:48,001 --> 01:06:50,443
we pay for the past.

1444
01:06:50,443 --> 01:06:51,276
So do you.

1445
01:06:58,383 --> 01:07:01,383
(yells out in pain)

1446
01:07:07,061 --> 01:07:10,228
(body thuds on floor)

1447
01:07:14,337 --> 01:07:17,170
(sorrowful music)

1448
01:07:23,710 --> 01:07:27,434
Man I am definitely switching my major.

1449
01:07:27,434 --> 01:07:28,833
Come here.

1450
01:07:28,833 --> 01:07:30,814
- What are we going to tell the cops?

1451
01:07:30,814 --> 01:07:33,731
I mean all our friends are dead,

1452
01:07:33,731 --> 01:07:34,804
and we almost got killed

1453
01:07:34,804 --> 01:07:38,221
because our parents were witch hunters.

1454
01:07:38,221 --> 01:07:42,152
- I think we can finally
put the past to rest.

1455
01:07:42,152 --> 01:07:44,408
- And what about us?

1456
01:07:44,408 --> 01:07:45,366
I mean,

1457
01:07:45,366 --> 01:07:46,199
cause I,

1458
01:07:47,053 --> 01:07:47,886
well I,

1459
01:07:49,099 --> 01:07:51,432
- Shut up and kiss me, Jack.

1460
01:07:52,284 --> 01:07:55,117
(uplifting music)

1461
01:08:17,783 --> 01:08:20,533
(dramatic music)
