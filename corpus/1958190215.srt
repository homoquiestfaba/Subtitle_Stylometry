1
00:00:27,862 --> 00:00:29,196
<i>Relax, Ego.</i>

2
00:00:29,263 --> 00:00:30,532
<i>We're only</i>
<i>a few minutes behind you.</i>

3
00:00:30,598 --> 00:00:32,399
<i>Focus on taking</i>
<i>out that nuclear plant.</i>

4
00:00:32,466 --> 00:00:34,167
Let the girls
focus on distracting them.

5
00:00:35,402 --> 00:00:37,337
<i>Okay.</i>
<i>There's the shoreline.</i>

6
00:00:37,404 --> 00:00:39,807
Stay alert.
Eyes open, ladies.

7
00:00:41,074 --> 00:00:42,010
God help us.

8
00:00:47,749 --> 00:00:49,651
<i>It's awfully quiet.</i>

9
00:00:49,717 --> 00:00:51,385
How about I knock on the door
with an old Mack,

10
00:00:51,451 --> 00:00:52,520
we can wake 'em up.

11
00:01:04,264 --> 00:01:05,800
I see something.

12
00:01:05,867 --> 00:01:08,603
<i>It does not</i>
<i>appear to be operational.</i>

13
00:01:10,972 --> 00:01:12,372
<i>Welcome to North Kiyung.</i>

14
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:14,742
Is any of this ancient
military shit operational?

15
00:01:14,809 --> 00:01:15,944
This doesn't feel right.

16
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:17,277
Something's wrong.

17
00:01:20,347 --> 00:01:22,249
Looks like someone's awake.

18
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:24,819
What is it?
What is it?

19
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:27,254
Anybody see it?
Country?

20
00:01:27,321 --> 00:01:28,623
Negative, no joy.

21
00:01:33,728 --> 00:01:35,797
Right. Missile. There!

22
00:01:36,931 --> 00:01:37,765
<i>Warning, warning.</i>

23
00:01:39,867 --> 00:01:41,636
<i>We have friendlies</i>
<i>down in the hot zone.</i>

24
00:01:41,703 --> 00:01:45,006
<i>I repeat, we have friendlies</i>
<i>down in the hot zone.</i>

25
00:03:56,938 --> 00:03:57,839
Come on.

26
00:03:57,905 --> 00:03:59,707
Don't cheat, yeah,
don't cheat.

27
00:03:59,774 --> 00:04:01,475
Stay straight,
stay straight, get up.

28
00:04:01,542 --> 00:04:03,276
Don't cheat.
Two more.

29
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:05,646
Two more. Last one.

30
00:04:05,713 --> 00:04:07,115
Put it away,
put it away, put it away,

31
00:04:07,181 --> 00:04:08,649
put it away, put it away.

32
00:04:10,551 --> 00:04:12,385
Air Force baby,
that's how we do it!

33
00:04:12,452 --> 00:04:14,522
- Let's go.
- Yes, sir.

34
00:04:14,589 --> 00:04:17,390
- Congratulations, man.
- Oh, man. Got it.

35
00:04:18,926 --> 00:04:21,361
- Congratulations.
- Hey, thank you.

36
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:23,531
- Good job.
- Thanks.

37
00:04:27,334 --> 00:04:29,670
Man, hey, not gonna lie.

38
00:04:31,172 --> 00:04:33,241
That last one kinda hurt.

39
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:34,675
Looks like it.

40
00:04:34,742 --> 00:04:38,179
Look, the Colonel's may run us
some exercises,

41
00:04:38,246 --> 00:04:39,547
the next couple days,

42
00:04:39,614 --> 00:04:40,815
so try not to hurt yourself,
all right?

43
00:04:40,882 --> 00:04:42,216
Especially with these guys
over here.

44
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:43,684
I'll be ready.

45
00:04:43,751 --> 00:04:45,385
I'm always ready, you know that.

46
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:47,822
I know, last time
out of here for a week,

47
00:04:47,889 --> 00:04:48,756
how much your arms hurt.

48
00:04:48,823 --> 00:04:50,024
You couldn't move
the flight stick.

49
00:04:50,091 --> 00:04:51,291
Yada, yada, yada, yada.

50
00:04:51,358 --> 00:04:52,560
Oh, my gosh.
No, no, no, no.

51
00:04:52,627 --> 00:04:53,628
- That was--
- No, come on,

52
00:04:53,694 --> 00:04:54,529
you can't do it, not this time.

53
00:04:54,595 --> 00:04:55,897
That was different, man.

54
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:58,032
I had two guys
on my back at that time.

55
00:04:58,099 --> 00:05:00,501
You were one of them.

56
00:05:00,568 --> 00:05:03,470
Okay. Just be ready.

57
00:05:03,538 --> 00:05:06,373
Are we--are we gonna go?
Are we going to North Kiyung?

58
00:05:07,742 --> 00:05:08,843
Let's
just say I got a hunch.

59
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:10,511
All right?

60
00:05:10,578 --> 00:05:13,047
Just be ready for anything.

61
00:05:13,114 --> 00:05:14,414
Well, I'm gonna need a team.

62
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:17,118
I mean, these guys at AFLA,
they're good,

63
00:05:17,185 --> 00:05:19,287
but I don't think
they can handle any of that.

64
00:05:19,352 --> 00:05:21,354
Gotta change up the simulations.

65
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:23,356
Start focusing on those SAMs.

66
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:26,627
Listen, we'll be fine.
Come on, man.

67
00:05:26,694 --> 00:05:27,962
It's the red,
white, and blue, baby.

68
00:05:28,029 --> 00:05:29,496
You know how we do.

69
00:05:29,564 --> 00:05:31,364
Now go get 'em.

70
00:05:35,236 --> 00:05:36,403
<i>Angle to your departure.</i>

71
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:39,173
<i>Frequency is 263.07.</i>

72
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:44,477
Target is six miles
and coming fast.

73
00:05:44,545 --> 00:05:46,013
Here we go, Baby Bear.

74
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,049
Hey, Edge, what do we got
on the mission playlist today?

75
00:05:48,115 --> 00:05:49,750
<i>How about</i>
<i>something a little more subtle</i>

76
00:05:49,817 --> 00:05:52,019
like Christian
like this time around.

77
00:05:52,086 --> 00:05:54,354
Now, you're talking
my language. Amen.

78
00:05:55,122 --> 00:05:58,526
<i>Nah, I'm thinking</i>
<i>rock and roll for this crowd.</i>

79
00:05:58,593 --> 00:06:00,595
How about some Stealing Eden?

80
00:06:00,661 --> 00:06:02,930
Oh, I got just the track.

81
00:06:08,603 --> 00:06:10,671
Take it to Buster girls.

82
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:31,893
As you know, North Kiyung
has been performing

83
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:34,161
multiple amounts
of missile tests.

84
00:06:34,228 --> 00:06:36,697
At 0600 hours this morning,

85
00:06:36,764 --> 00:06:38,431
they managed to land
one sixty miles

86
00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:41,335
outside the Russia shoreline.

87
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,671
As we speak,
the Navy is sending out

88
00:06:43,738 --> 00:06:47,642
a second aircraft carrier
to the border of South Kiyung.

89
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:50,477
Are we leaning more towards
a strategic airstrike?

90
00:06:50,544 --> 00:06:53,114
The losses
will be catastrophic.

91
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,516
The last time
we had a similar situation,

92
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:58,485
we lost 2,800 fighters.

93
00:06:59,687 --> 00:07:02,723
We'd be sending off fighters
to their death.

94
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:06,961
Assemble a team of commandos
and eliminate Kim Wun,

95
00:07:07,028 --> 00:07:09,697
one of the Joint Chiefs-of-staff
recommendations.

96
00:07:09,764 --> 00:07:12,033
Eliminating Kim Wun
would buy us some time,

97
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:14,467
but it does not stop
the missile production.

98
00:07:14,535 --> 00:07:16,604
We'd only be passing
the reins to a pissed off

99
00:07:16,671 --> 00:07:19,340
sibling out for revenge.

100
00:07:19,407 --> 00:07:22,043
Why not eliminate them both?

101
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:23,144
And then what?

102
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:24,879
Kill his cousins,
his uncles, his nephew,

103
00:07:24,946 --> 00:07:26,380
his girlfriend, son-in-law?

104
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,848
If that's what needs to be done
to save the future

105
00:07:27,915 --> 00:07:29,150
of this country.

106
00:07:29,216 --> 00:07:31,986
I think eliminating
one man's family tree

107
00:07:32,053 --> 00:07:34,889
is certainly more beneficial
to us than someone

108
00:07:34,956 --> 00:07:38,259
eliminating
our entire country, sir.

109
00:07:38,326 --> 00:07:39,827
And I think
the National Security Council

110
00:07:39,894 --> 00:07:41,729
would agree.

111
00:07:41,796 --> 00:07:43,764
Why don't you ask him yourself?

112
00:07:44,932 --> 00:07:46,600
Good morning Colonel.

113
00:07:46,667 --> 00:07:50,004
Colonel.
Grace Daley National Security.

114
00:07:51,172 --> 00:07:54,208
So that makes 24 shows
this year?

115
00:07:54,275 --> 00:07:56,744
That's affirmative.

116
00:07:56,811 --> 00:07:58,579
It's actually not that bad.

117
00:07:58,646 --> 00:08:00,247
Listen we have to--

118
00:08:02,383 --> 00:08:04,452
Russian MiGs?

119
00:08:04,552 --> 00:08:05,953
The hell are they doing out?

120
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:11,092
Let's get inside.

121
00:08:13,928 --> 00:08:16,197
I'm telling you, man,
I was like Jesus up there,

122
00:08:16,263 --> 00:08:17,999
dude, I banked him.

123
00:08:19,567 --> 00:08:20,835
Just earlier today

124
00:08:20,901 --> 00:08:22,570
we had some unexpected visitors

125
00:08:22,636 --> 00:08:25,272
over the Atlantic Ocean
when two MiGs

126
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:26,841
flew just twenty feet off
the deck

127
00:08:26,907 --> 00:08:29,176
of one
of our Navy aircraft carriers.

128
00:08:29,243 --> 00:08:32,313
A spokesperson from the Navy
tells us that they immediately

129
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:35,850
scrambled four F-18 fighters
to escort the MiGS

130
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:38,986
<i>back across the border</i>
<i>to the Kuban territory.</i>

131
00:08:39,053 --> 00:08:42,056
The MiGS claimed to be
on a training exercise

132
00:08:42,123 --> 00:08:46,394
and stated they were simply
saying hello to the carrier

133
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:48,763
in their daring,
unannounced fly by.

134
00:08:48,829 --> 00:08:50,531
I'm Brooke McKinley.
Stay with us.

135
00:08:50,598 --> 00:08:53,502
We'll be right back.

136
00:08:53,567 --> 00:08:54,902
Yeah. Okay, next time
we're up there,

137
00:08:54,969 --> 00:08:56,237
let me buzz one of their ships

138
00:08:56,303 --> 00:08:57,671
and see how well
that's saying hello stories.

139
00:08:57,738 --> 00:08:59,874
- Yeah, baby.
- Yeah. Woo.

140
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:02,243
Man, they gotta change
my call sign to Hollywood, man.

141
00:09:02,309 --> 00:09:03,444
I'm making the news.

142
00:09:03,512 --> 00:09:05,846
- Hell, yeah.
- Hey, sweetheart.

143
00:09:05,913 --> 00:09:08,015
Wanna see what
a real pilot looks like, huh?

144
00:09:08,082 --> 00:09:10,818
Funny, I didn't see your face
on the report.

145
00:09:10,885 --> 00:09:13,087
Nah, I think he was talking
about that special

146
00:09:13,154 --> 00:09:16,390
itch cream commercial
after the news report.

147
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:21,162
Now, that's funny.
I'd expect that out of Riddles.

148
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:25,433
Hey, do you--do you hear
something over here, huh?

149
00:09:25,499 --> 00:09:26,967
Got it.

150
00:09:27,034 --> 00:09:28,636
- It's just a little wasp.
- Get over yourself, Igor.

151
00:09:28,702 --> 00:09:29,937
It's Ego.

152
00:09:30,004 --> 00:09:32,239
But don't worry
you'll get it Widows.

153
00:09:32,306 --> 00:09:33,574
It's okay.

154
00:09:33,641 --> 00:09:36,644
She flies planes guys, huh?

155
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:39,413
Edge, no. Edge.

156
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,714
How about
I rip out your tongue

157
00:09:40,781 --> 00:09:42,249
and shove it up your ass?
I mean, really?

158
00:09:42,316 --> 00:09:43,884
What's your problem
anyway, Jeeter?

159
00:09:43,951 --> 00:09:45,786
Or is this some sort
of grudge against

160
00:09:45,853 --> 00:09:47,154
one of your ex-girlfriends?

161
00:09:47,221 --> 00:09:49,023
'Cause let me
tell you something,

162
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:52,259
you might be a pilot,
but it don't mean you can fly

163
00:09:52,326 --> 00:09:54,628
and any one of these girls,
including myself,

164
00:09:54,695 --> 00:09:56,831
will outmaneuver you
in the sky any day.

165
00:09:56,897 --> 00:09:58,432
You see, just 'cause you got
your name on a flyer

166
00:09:58,499 --> 00:10:02,103
and you do a couple barrel rolls
and an air show once a week,

167
00:10:02,169 --> 00:10:04,371
see that don't make you
a fighter pilot, honey.

168
00:10:04,438 --> 00:10:07,741
Your girls is doing tricks
so people clap.

169
00:10:07,808 --> 00:10:09,310
- Right.
- Big deal.

170
00:10:11,078 --> 00:10:13,481
- Okay. Really?
- Guys, Commander's coming.

171
00:10:13,548 --> 00:10:15,382
Chill out.

172
00:10:18,452 --> 00:10:20,488
Commander.

173
00:10:20,555 --> 00:10:22,189
Is there a story behind this?

174
00:10:23,558 --> 00:10:24,725
No, ma'am.

175
00:10:24,792 --> 00:10:26,994
Literally just fell off
the table.

176
00:10:29,797 --> 00:10:31,165
Air show went well today?

177
00:10:31,232 --> 00:10:33,568
Yes, ma'am.
Another one in the books.

178
00:10:33,634 --> 00:10:35,069
Good to hear.

179
00:10:35,136 --> 00:10:36,437
Looks like you'll get headed
to Maryland next week.

180
00:10:36,505 --> 00:10:39,206
- Good luck.
- Excuse me, Commander.

181
00:10:39,273 --> 00:10:43,144
Um, we were wondering
if we could possibly work

182
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:45,246
on some maneuvering
for the Maryland show

183
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:47,549
and maybe we could borrow

184
00:10:47,616 --> 00:10:49,850
a few of the men for some...

185
00:10:51,018 --> 00:10:53,087
dog fight simulation?

186
00:10:58,926 --> 00:11:00,127
I don't see why not.

187
00:11:00,194 --> 00:11:01,462
If it helps
with your show routine.

188
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:02,930
I'll run it past the Admiral.

189
00:11:02,997 --> 00:11:04,665
Thank you, Commander.

190
00:11:08,435 --> 00:11:10,137
<i>The United States</i>
<i>has placed sanctions</i>

191
00:11:10,204 --> 00:11:12,507
<i>on North Kiyung</i>
<i>and some of its financial firms</i>

192
00:11:12,574 --> 00:11:15,109
<i>in Giannia,</i>
<i>in an effort to tighten the rope</i>

193
00:11:15,176 --> 00:11:17,512
<i>around its nuclear</i>
<i>missile developments.</i>

194
00:11:17,579 --> 00:11:21,081
We are learning now
that a third US aircraft carrier

195
00:11:21,148 --> 00:11:23,150
is en route to its border.

196
00:11:23,217 --> 00:11:25,352
<i>North Kiyung released</i>
<i>a public statement today</i>

197
00:11:25,419 --> 00:11:27,955
<i>claiming that they will</i>
<i>continue their ballistic...</i>

198
00:11:28,022 --> 00:11:30,824
- Knock, knock.
- Who's there?

199
00:11:30,891 --> 00:11:34,195
- No one.
- No one who?

200
00:11:34,261 --> 00:11:37,031
No one at all
'cause we're all goners.

201
00:11:37,097 --> 00:11:41,168
They have been threatening us
since way before our time.

202
00:11:41,235 --> 00:11:43,938
They're not gonna do anything.

203
00:11:44,004 --> 00:11:45,806
They're just a gum under
the shoe of the old red,

204
00:11:45,873 --> 00:11:47,007
white, and blue.

205
00:11:47,074 --> 00:11:48,610
Speaking of gum
under the shoe,

206
00:11:48,677 --> 00:11:50,911
thanks for taking care of
that whole Jeeter thing today.

207
00:11:50,978 --> 00:11:52,614
Yeah, I don't know what it is,

208
00:11:52,681 --> 00:11:55,550
but that guy
just does not like us.

209
00:11:55,617 --> 00:11:56,784
Don't mention it.

210
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:58,620
It was just the right thing
to do.

211
00:11:58,687 --> 00:12:01,088
Besides he deserved it.

212
00:12:01,155 --> 00:12:02,723
<i>And furthermore,</i>

213
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:04,391
<i>the United States is demanding</i>
<i>the release of three</i>

214
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:07,962
Americans currently
in custody in North Kiyung.

215
00:12:08,028 --> 00:12:11,799
One of them being Olson Walter,
only 22 years old,

216
00:12:11,865 --> 00:12:15,069
<i>the condition of the Americans</i>
<i>is currently unknown.</i>

217
00:12:15,135 --> 00:12:16,971
Those poor guys
didn't do anything.

218
00:12:17,037 --> 00:12:18,105
They're just using 'em
as leverage

219
00:12:18,172 --> 00:12:19,340
and they damn well know it.

220
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:21,710
Did you guys know
that their whole country

221
00:12:21,775 --> 00:12:24,044
believes America
is just military?

222
00:12:24,111 --> 00:12:25,479
Yeah,
I read that somewhere.

223
00:12:25,547 --> 00:12:27,815
They have like pictures
of American military men

224
00:12:27,881 --> 00:12:30,351
torturing women
in their school hallways.

225
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:31,785
Yup.

226
00:12:31,852 --> 00:12:34,355
They think the whole reason
we exist is just to attack them.

227
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:35,322
Awful.

228
00:12:35,389 --> 00:12:37,891
Whatever it is,
I'm an American.

229
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:39,994
My family lives here.

230
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:42,896
Now, that I'm flying
is good enough for me.

231
00:12:42,963 --> 00:12:47,034
Speaking of flying,
Edge tomorrow,

232
00:12:47,101 --> 00:12:49,103
let's keep
it cool up there, yeah?

233
00:12:50,538 --> 00:12:52,139
That's the plan, Lieutenant.

234
00:12:54,141 --> 00:12:56,544
All right, TV off.
Rec time, girls.

235
00:13:28,008 --> 00:13:29,843
Split 'em up
and do what we do best.

236
00:13:35,517 --> 00:13:36,917
It's show time, boy.

237
00:13:51,365 --> 00:13:53,934
I'm not used
to having a RIO flying with me.

238
00:13:54,001 --> 00:13:56,203
Hang tight little Bear.

239
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:57,971
<i>What's the rules, Jeeter?</i>

240
00:13:58,038 --> 00:13:59,006
Rules are simple.

241
00:13:59,073 --> 00:14:00,474
Once we obtain a missile lock,

242
00:14:00,542 --> 00:14:02,242
you drop below the deck
and sit on the bench

243
00:14:02,309 --> 00:14:04,278
until the rest
of the wing chickies join you.

244
00:14:06,213 --> 00:14:08,449
And when we get a missile lock?

245
00:14:08,516 --> 00:14:09,684
That is highly unlikely,

246
00:14:09,751 --> 00:14:11,786
but if you do,
Jeeter will buy you all dinner.

247
00:14:11,885 --> 00:14:13,253
Thanks, Stixx.

248
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,657
Riddles, you and Bear
are cloud jumping.

249
00:14:15,724 --> 00:14:17,024
Riot and I will skim the pool.

250
00:14:17,091 --> 00:14:18,760
Edge and Wiki,
you're the sheets.

251
00:14:18,827 --> 00:14:20,961
- Get some cover.
- Game on.

252
00:14:23,698 --> 00:14:27,201
Okay. And starting now.

253
00:14:29,036 --> 00:14:30,170
<i>I want Country and Riot.</i>

254
00:14:30,237 --> 00:14:31,472
You guys take the groupies.

255
00:14:32,507 --> 00:14:34,942
I got
your groupies, Igor.

256
00:14:35,008 --> 00:14:37,077
Copy, bro.
Eyes on lock.

257
00:14:39,146 --> 00:14:40,414
If he gets any closer
he's gonna

258
00:14:40,481 --> 00:14:41,616
be the logo on my shirt.

259
00:14:41,683 --> 00:14:43,450
One more sec.
I know what I'm doing.

260
00:14:43,518 --> 00:14:44,184
Taking her down.

261
00:14:44,251 --> 00:14:46,086
Let's see what you got.

262
00:14:46,153 --> 00:14:47,522
Hold on.

263
00:14:51,425 --> 00:14:52,993
They're
right behind us, bro.

264
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,495
- They're right behind us.
- I see her.

265
00:15:00,568 --> 00:15:02,369
Oh, not today.

266
00:15:06,974 --> 00:15:10,043
Head locked and painted.

267
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:11,445
Woo! One for the ladies.

268
00:15:11,513 --> 00:15:13,480
Damn it.

269
00:15:13,548 --> 00:15:16,551
Sorry, Jeeter.
Another drink is on this flight.

270
00:15:16,618 --> 00:15:18,085
It's all right,
Lieutenant.

271
00:15:18,152 --> 00:15:20,220
This comedy show
is just about over anyways.

272
00:15:21,355 --> 00:15:24,692
- Did he say over?
- That's what I heard.

273
00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:26,427
No!

274
00:15:26,493 --> 00:15:28,429
<i>- Shit.</i>
- Damn, that was close.

275
00:15:28,495 --> 00:15:29,997
That's how they get you.

276
00:15:31,331 --> 00:15:33,033
Her range never pays off.

277
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,201
Where'd he go?

278
00:15:35,603 --> 00:15:37,772
I see him.
He's going head on.

279
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:38,773
Tag it and bag it, Edge.

280
00:15:42,844 --> 00:15:44,978
<i>Jeeter, you got Edge</i>
<i>coming right towards us.</i>

281
00:15:45,045 --> 00:15:46,480
Change course, buddy.

282
00:15:46,548 --> 00:15:48,415
No way, Stixx.
This is exactly what we do.

283
00:15:51,351 --> 00:15:52,654
You might
wanna tighten your buckle up

284
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,623
for this one, Wiki.
If we fail, we fail.

285
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:02,996
Country's back.
She's on our 6:00.

286
00:16:03,063 --> 00:16:04,264
Edge, fall back.

287
00:16:04,331 --> 00:16:05,800
Might wanna move,
Lieutenant.

288
00:16:05,867 --> 00:16:07,635
If you don't break now
you're gonna hit us too.

289
00:16:09,871 --> 00:16:11,405
This one's personal.

290
00:16:13,641 --> 00:16:14,742
Edge, move out.

291
00:16:14,809 --> 00:16:16,276
Country's got him.

292
00:16:16,343 --> 00:16:17,946
Not good.
Not good.

293
00:16:18,011 --> 00:16:19,112
Country,
get us out of here.

294
00:16:19,179 --> 00:16:21,081
Damn it.

295
00:16:24,552 --> 00:16:25,587
Shit!

296
00:16:26,788 --> 00:16:27,922
- Whoa.
- Is that shit

297
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:29,323
even in the handbook?

298
00:16:32,392 --> 00:16:34,829
And that's two
for the ladies.

299
00:16:34,896 --> 00:16:36,698
Oh, my God.

300
00:16:39,433 --> 00:16:41,636
<i>You're instructed</i>
<i>to land immediately.</i>

301
00:16:41,703 --> 00:16:43,571
Just great.

302
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:06,326
I am in charge up there.

303
00:17:07,394 --> 00:17:11,599
When I give you an order,
I expect it to be followed.

304
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:13,835
And who's in charge
when it comes to seeking out

305
00:17:13,902 --> 00:17:15,302
for our rights as women?

306
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:17,872
Is there a captain
or a commander or someone

307
00:17:17,939 --> 00:17:21,676
who's gonna defend my rights
and my dignity as a woman?

308
00:17:21,743 --> 00:17:24,077
Can we serve the country
just like the men?

309
00:17:24,144 --> 00:17:25,312
And you are.

310
00:17:25,379 --> 00:17:27,649
- Okay, guys, come on.
- I am, yes.

311
00:17:27,715 --> 00:17:29,684
Under pressure, I am.

312
00:17:29,751 --> 00:17:31,953
You know damn well
if I pulled out of that line,

313
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:33,453
we would never hear
the end of it.

314
00:17:33,521 --> 00:17:35,757
They'd be laughing at us
even more.

315
00:17:35,823 --> 00:17:38,492
I'll be damned
if I let any man label me

316
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,562
or my team
as anything less than equal.

317
00:17:40,628 --> 00:17:43,497
So what? Maybe I upset
our government today

318
00:17:43,565 --> 00:17:45,934
and my superiors,
but I know I stood up

319
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,904
for every woman on the planet
by shutting Jeeter's mouth.

320
00:17:49,971 --> 00:17:52,874
Look, I respect
your Christianity

321
00:17:52,941 --> 00:17:54,474
and your devotion to Christ.

322
00:17:54,542 --> 00:17:57,444
You're supposed to love,
forgive, and all of that.

323
00:17:57,512 --> 00:18:00,380
But my job as a pilot
for the United States Navy

324
00:18:00,447 --> 00:18:03,551
and a member of this team
is to protect us,

325
00:18:03,618 --> 00:18:08,221
and I will,
even if it means dying.

326
00:18:08,288 --> 00:18:11,626
Now, I don't know
about you, Country,

327
00:18:11,693 --> 00:18:17,497
but to me...
that stands for something.

328
00:18:21,603 --> 00:18:23,071
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>who the hell authorized</i>

329
00:18:23,136 --> 00:18:25,640
<i>that ridiculous circus act.</i>

330
00:18:25,707 --> 00:18:27,407
I understand, Admiral.
I'm looking into it now.

331
00:18:27,474 --> 00:18:29,343
<i>And I want someone</i>
<i>in my desk or of yours,</i>

332
00:18:29,409 --> 00:18:31,713
- within the hour.
- Within the hour, sir.

333
00:18:33,213 --> 00:18:34,314
Good day, Admiral.

334
00:18:40,688 --> 00:18:42,255
Well, I don't think
I need to explain much

335
00:18:42,322 --> 00:18:43,791
as I'm sure you overheard.

336
00:18:43,858 --> 00:18:45,827
You're losing control
of your squadron, Lieutenant?

337
00:18:45,893 --> 00:18:46,995
No, ma'am.

338
00:18:47,061 --> 00:18:48,730
Today was a isolated incident

339
00:18:48,796 --> 00:18:50,565
and I've already spoken
with Lieutenant Lee

340
00:18:50,632 --> 00:18:53,801
about the situation to assure
it doesn't happen again.

341
00:18:53,868 --> 00:18:56,470
If I knew this was a contest
on who's the better pilot

342
00:18:56,537 --> 00:18:58,138
or a contest
of colorful actions,

343
00:18:58,205 --> 00:19:00,207
I would've never approved
the exercise.

344
00:19:00,273 --> 00:19:01,776
Unfortunately, it happened.

345
00:19:01,843 --> 00:19:03,611
Now the Admiral wants someone
to be held accountable.

346
00:19:03,678 --> 00:19:06,714
As the team leader,
I must assume responsibility

347
00:19:06,781 --> 00:19:09,282
for my Wing Girls'
actions, ma'am.

348
00:19:09,349 --> 00:19:11,786
You do realize that your wings
will be taken away

349
00:19:11,853 --> 00:19:13,453
until further notice.

350
00:19:13,521 --> 00:19:15,523
You still wanna take
that responsibility?

351
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:20,928
- Yes, ma'am.
- No, she doesn't.

352
00:19:22,429 --> 00:19:23,798
The flight recorder
is going to reflect

353
00:19:23,865 --> 00:19:25,767
that Lieutenant Riebach
gave me a direct order

354
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:28,536
numerous times
and I disobeyed Commander.

355
00:19:28,603 --> 00:19:31,204
Suspending her would be wrong
and against policy, ma'am.

356
00:19:31,271 --> 00:19:32,607
Policy?

357
00:19:32,674 --> 00:19:34,742
What the hell do you know
about policy, Lieutenant?

358
00:19:34,809 --> 00:19:36,878
You're really gonna stand here
and try to educate me

359
00:19:36,944 --> 00:19:38,746
on the Navy's handbook?

360
00:19:38,813 --> 00:19:41,115
My apologies,
I forgot you're a sea lawyer.

361
00:19:41,181 --> 00:19:42,784
No, no, no, ma'am.

362
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:46,154
That was not what I was trying
to say, wrong choice of words.

363
00:19:46,253 --> 00:19:48,556
You're damn right,
bad choice of words.

364
00:19:48,623 --> 00:19:50,525
All of you get in here.

365
00:19:55,395 --> 00:19:57,431
As of today, the Wing Girls
will be restricted

366
00:19:57,497 --> 00:20:01,636
from pilot duty and suspended
until further notice.

367
00:20:01,703 --> 00:20:03,470
Consider yourselves rattled.

368
00:20:05,405 --> 00:20:07,441
Ladies, these aircraft
are not toys.

369
00:20:07,508 --> 00:20:10,377
They're not for skylarking,
they're for combat.

370
00:20:10,444 --> 00:20:12,113
I realize that your job
entitles you to do

371
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:16,718
certain aerial performances
that a regular pilot cannot.

372
00:20:16,784 --> 00:20:19,419
But that's for 30
approved minutes a week.

373
00:20:19,486 --> 00:20:21,354
Not at your discretion
and certainly not off

374
00:20:21,421 --> 00:20:22,924
and above my ship.

375
00:20:25,459 --> 00:20:27,895
I want you to know
it saddens me to do this, girls.

376
00:20:27,962 --> 00:20:29,797
I've been tested numerous
times in my career

377
00:20:29,864 --> 00:20:32,432
and I can't say that I wouldn't
have acted the same way,

378
00:20:32,499 --> 00:20:34,736
but as your commanding officer

379
00:20:34,802 --> 00:20:37,672
and at the admiral's
very heated request,

380
00:20:37,739 --> 00:20:39,306
unfortunately,
I'm gonna have to ask you

381
00:20:39,372 --> 00:20:41,542
to pack your sea bags.

382
00:20:41,609 --> 00:20:44,746
You'll be flown to the airport
in the morning.

383
00:20:44,812 --> 00:20:46,614
Dismissed.

384
00:21:01,294 --> 00:21:06,200
So how long do you guys
think we'll be suspended for?

385
00:21:06,266 --> 00:21:08,669
No idea.

386
00:21:08,736 --> 00:21:11,205
I hear the Wing Girls
are performing next weekend

387
00:21:11,271 --> 00:21:14,441
in Maryland
if anyone wants to go.

388
00:21:14,509 --> 00:21:16,210
Oh, that's right.

389
00:21:16,276 --> 00:21:17,845
Show is canceled.

390
00:21:17,912 --> 00:21:19,747
Never mind.

391
00:21:26,154 --> 00:21:29,724
Hey, Edge, knock, knock.

392
00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:32,392
- Who's there?
- Ida.

393
00:21:33,493 --> 00:21:35,029
- Ida who?
- Ida rather be suspended

394
00:21:35,096 --> 00:21:37,832
with you than being
on active duty with Jeeter.

395
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,802
Thank you, Riddles.

396
00:21:53,915 --> 00:21:55,315
Hey, Country.

397
00:21:55,382 --> 00:21:56,818
Look. Not tonight, Billy.

398
00:21:56,884 --> 00:21:59,587
All right, I really
cannot handle one more thing.

399
00:21:59,654 --> 00:22:02,422
- So unless you're gonna just--
- Look...

400
00:22:04,225 --> 00:22:08,062
I'm really sorry
for how things went down today.

401
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:12,099
It's just guys being guys.

402
00:22:13,301 --> 00:22:15,536
I hope you know that.

403
00:22:15,603 --> 00:22:20,373
Well, we certainly
weren't discharged.

404
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:24,411
We're just taking a small break.

405
00:22:24,477 --> 00:22:27,081
Well, I just want you to know

406
00:22:27,148 --> 00:22:29,217
that I think it's really great

407
00:22:29,283 --> 00:22:31,652
what you guys are doing,

408
00:22:31,719 --> 00:22:33,654
representing the women and all.

409
00:22:35,256 --> 00:22:36,624
I'm glad to have you guys here.

410
00:22:37,992 --> 00:22:39,894
I'd fly with you anytime.

411
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:46,200
Is Jeeter
in line somewhere behind you?

412
00:22:46,267 --> 00:22:48,069
Jeeter?

413
00:22:48,135 --> 00:22:50,571
Uh, well, I don't--
I don't really think so,

414
00:22:50,638 --> 00:22:54,008
but I do believe
that he's receiving

415
00:22:54,075 --> 00:22:55,743
some punishment himself.

416
00:22:57,578 --> 00:22:59,479
Don't expect
an apology from him.

417
00:23:00,548 --> 00:23:02,950
Jeeter will always be Jeeter.

418
00:23:05,586 --> 00:23:10,490
Anyway, I'm proud
to serve with you.

419
00:23:13,828 --> 00:23:15,630
Thank you.

420
00:23:15,696 --> 00:23:18,799
I did just hear that,
well, they might be sending

421
00:23:18,866 --> 00:23:21,068
a couple of us
down to North Kiyung.

422
00:23:22,469 --> 00:23:24,705
It's pretty heated down there
right now.

423
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:28,475
Yeah, it's been
all over the news.

424
00:23:29,977 --> 00:23:32,880
You know,
be careful up there, Billy.

425
00:23:32,947 --> 00:23:34,682
That's not the most
welcoming sky

426
00:23:34,749 --> 00:23:37,551
for fighters as we've learned.

427
00:23:37,618 --> 00:23:39,520
I'll keep you in my prayers.

428
00:23:41,756 --> 00:23:44,058
And Jeeter too.

429
00:23:47,828 --> 00:23:49,931
I hope to serve
with you again, Lieutenant.

430
00:23:52,099 --> 00:23:53,701
I'd be honored.

431
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:13,888
<i>Good day, gentlemen.</i>

432
00:24:13,955 --> 00:24:17,625
<i>Today, we're gonna put you right</i>
<i>in the heart of enemy territory.</i>

433
00:24:17,692 --> 00:24:19,492
<i>You're outnumbered, two to one.</i>

434
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,762
<i>- Let's see what you got.</i>
- Let's get dirty.

435
00:24:21,829 --> 00:24:23,831
Only two?
Come on, Colonel.

436
00:24:23,898 --> 00:24:25,333
I thought you were giving us
a challenge.

437
00:24:25,399 --> 00:24:26,968
Hey, I'm okay with two.

438
00:24:27,034 --> 00:24:28,636
Of course you are, Poet.

439
00:24:28,703 --> 00:24:30,504
You're a rider, not a fighter.

440
00:24:30,571 --> 00:24:32,807
Ooh, splash one.

441
00:24:32,873 --> 00:24:34,408
<i>No worries, boys.</i>

442
00:24:34,474 --> 00:24:35,843
As soon as I down my bogies,
come over for the leftovers.

443
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:37,945
Here they come.

444
00:24:39,814 --> 00:24:41,615
And they hate smiling.

445
00:24:41,682 --> 00:24:44,418
On 1984, there was an actor
that gave

446
00:24:44,484 --> 00:24:46,721
one of the greatest lines
of all time.

447
00:24:46,787 --> 00:24:49,223
And what would that be?

448
00:24:49,290 --> 00:24:50,691
I'll be back.

449
00:24:54,662 --> 00:24:56,230
I'll take two high.
You take two low.

450
00:24:56,297 --> 00:24:57,231
How's that sound?

451
00:24:59,233 --> 00:25:00,434
<i>Oh, hell no.</i>

452
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,702
The Black man ain't dying first.

453
00:25:14,949 --> 00:25:16,851
You guys really fell for that?

454
00:25:16,917 --> 00:25:19,086
Come on now.

455
00:25:19,153 --> 00:25:20,554
Splash one...

456
00:25:22,089 --> 00:25:24,492
and splash two.

457
00:25:24,558 --> 00:25:26,727
What was that, 30 seconds?

458
00:25:27,962 --> 00:25:30,931
No, no, no. I think it's 31.
You're slipping.

459
00:25:31,966 --> 00:25:35,569
Somebody get Bells his smiley
face sticker so we can go home.

460
00:25:35,636 --> 00:25:36,637
<i>There we go.</i>

461
00:26:47,174 --> 00:26:49,443
It's only for
a little while this time, Kaden.

462
00:26:49,511 --> 00:26:52,847
And when I get back, I'll be
able to take you to the base.

463
00:26:52,913 --> 00:26:55,049
You can play with the simulator.
You like that, right?

464
00:26:55,116 --> 00:26:56,851
I know, but I wanna go with you.

465
00:26:56,917 --> 00:26:58,686
I wanna fly with you.

466
00:26:59,487 --> 00:27:00,955
I know kiddo.

467
00:27:01,021 --> 00:27:03,157
I have something special
for you on the piano,

468
00:27:03,224 --> 00:27:05,759
so why don't you go get it
while daddy leaves. Okay?

469
00:27:06,561 --> 00:27:07,728
Okay. Okay.

470
00:27:07,795 --> 00:27:10,197
Go ahead. Go get it.

471
00:27:19,406 --> 00:27:20,575
Wow.

472
00:27:20,641 --> 00:27:22,009
I'm a pilot.

473
00:27:22,076 --> 00:27:24,345
Mommy, mommy,
I'm a pilot. I'm a pilot!

474
00:27:31,352 --> 00:27:33,020
Mommy!

475
00:27:33,087 --> 00:27:34,455
Come here.

476
00:27:34,523 --> 00:27:36,857
Oh, hey.

477
00:27:38,993 --> 00:27:41,061
Oh, I miss you so much.

478
00:27:41,128 --> 00:27:42,930
Look what grandma got me, mommy.

479
00:27:42,997 --> 00:27:45,166
Wow, a fighter jet.

480
00:27:45,232 --> 00:27:46,433
That's very cool.

481
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,702
Yeah, she said I got
to start practicing

482
00:27:48,769 --> 00:27:50,572
so I could chase seagulls
like you do.

483
00:27:50,639 --> 00:27:52,339
Chasing seagulls, huh?

484
00:27:52,406 --> 00:27:54,341
Well, you wanted
a Christian daughter,

485
00:27:54,408 --> 00:27:57,111
that was the easiest G-rated way
I could put it.

486
00:27:57,178 --> 00:27:59,246
Hey, look.
Who's here?

487
00:27:59,313 --> 00:28:01,583
- Hi, Riddles.
- Hey, Falcon.

488
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:03,350
Look what I can do.

489
00:28:08,255 --> 00:28:09,690
Margo!

490
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,093
This bitch gotta be kidding me.

491
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:16,030
Margo, wake up!

492
00:28:16,096 --> 00:28:19,400
Hey, you can't hear me
calling for you downstairs?

493
00:28:19,466 --> 00:28:21,402
It's kind of hard not to.

494
00:28:21,468 --> 00:28:23,971
Why do you want Tyler?
It's my first day home.

495
00:28:24,038 --> 00:28:25,372
Can I just sleep in?

496
00:28:25,439 --> 00:28:28,008
Sleep--it's 8:30. Get up!

497
00:28:28,075 --> 00:28:29,410
Dad says you're gonna
help me out

498
00:28:29,476 --> 00:28:32,012
with some stuff
around the house. Yo, B!

499
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:34,516
Calm them dogs down! Shut up!

500
00:28:37,751 --> 00:28:40,589
Isn't it a bit early
to be drinking?

501
00:28:40,655 --> 00:28:44,458
I thought you said you were
gonna quit once Mom passed away.

502
00:28:44,526 --> 00:28:45,826
Where the hell is Dad anyway?

503
00:28:45,893 --> 00:28:46,894
You think he'd
be happy to see me.

504
00:28:46,961 --> 00:28:47,962
He's out doing

505
00:28:48,028 --> 00:28:49,730
a beer bar hop thing.

506
00:28:49,797 --> 00:28:51,198
Oh, a beer one.
You know what?

507
00:28:51,265 --> 00:28:53,200
If my name was Coors Light,
he'd be happy to see me.

508
00:28:53,267 --> 00:28:55,202
That's a hella way
to talk about your dad.

509
00:28:55,269 --> 00:28:58,405
I don't need you coming in here,
asking questions,

510
00:28:58,472 --> 00:29:01,208
acting all cocky, okay?

511
00:29:01,275 --> 00:29:04,478
I'm surprised Dad
even let you crash here.

512
00:29:04,546 --> 00:29:05,946
And just show up unannounced.

513
00:29:06,013 --> 00:29:08,249
Are you listening to yourself?

514
00:29:09,216 --> 00:29:11,418
I'm his daughter,
which makes me your sister.

515
00:29:11,485 --> 00:29:12,920
Not for nothing, dickhead.

516
00:29:12,987 --> 00:29:14,488
This is my house, too.

517
00:29:17,091 --> 00:29:19,059
It was your home, okay?

518
00:29:19,126 --> 00:29:22,463
Until you abandoned us
for your air circus.

519
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:24,498
Get up.

520
00:29:24,566 --> 00:29:26,133
You can help me with the trash.

521
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,234
Dick.

522
00:30:07,241 --> 00:30:09,009
Now, in the Korean War,

523
00:30:09,076 --> 00:30:12,479
we lost 2,837 aircrafts

524
00:30:12,547 --> 00:30:14,014
and that was in 1950.

525
00:30:14,081 --> 00:30:16,150
Granted,
our aircraft capabilities

526
00:30:16,216 --> 00:30:18,352
have grown substantially,

527
00:30:18,419 --> 00:30:20,722
but so has
our missile stockpile.

528
00:30:20,789 --> 00:30:24,291
Colonel, are you giving us
a history class here?

529
00:30:24,358 --> 00:30:26,994
Could you please just get
to the point?

530
00:30:28,962 --> 00:30:31,432
As you saw on my test today,

531
00:30:31,498 --> 00:30:34,001
we were unsuccessful
when evading the SAMs

532
00:30:34,068 --> 00:30:37,237
when dealing
with two or more at a time.

533
00:30:37,304 --> 00:30:39,840
North Kiyung knows this
and I can assure you,

534
00:30:39,907 --> 00:30:43,010
they will launch at least
two per jet,

535
00:30:43,077 --> 00:30:44,845
at a minimum.

536
00:30:44,912 --> 00:30:46,980
This is where
we're gonna need pilots

537
00:30:47,047 --> 00:30:49,183
with exceptional skills.

538
00:30:49,249 --> 00:30:51,318
Now, we don't have time
to train for this,

539
00:30:52,554 --> 00:30:55,222
we need to attack ASAP.

540
00:30:55,289 --> 00:30:58,058
Now, in order for this attack
to be successful,

541
00:30:58,125 --> 00:31:00,695
we need to do this
in three stages.

542
00:31:03,364 --> 00:31:05,567
So what brings you
to the Navy, Colonel?

543
00:31:05,633 --> 00:31:07,769
To put it bluntly, North Kiyung.

544
00:31:07,836 --> 00:31:10,070
Ah. A lot I could say
about that.

545
00:31:10,137 --> 00:31:12,139
Getting worse by the minute.

546
00:31:12,206 --> 00:31:14,208
Washington needs to figure out
something quickly.

547
00:31:14,274 --> 00:31:15,976
Well, that's why we're here.

548
00:31:16,043 --> 00:31:17,512
I don't know
if you're aware, but we are

549
00:31:17,579 --> 00:31:20,314
from the Air Force Last
Resort Operation Center.

550
00:31:20,381 --> 00:31:22,316
And currently,
we're working a solution

551
00:31:22,383 --> 00:31:24,218
to shutting down North Kiyung

552
00:31:24,284 --> 00:31:27,522
and eliminating the constant
threat of nuclear attacks.

553
00:31:27,589 --> 00:31:30,090
And one of your squadrons
became a unit of interest

554
00:31:30,157 --> 00:31:31,659
in making this solution
a success.

555
00:31:31,726 --> 00:31:34,128
We've already sent
two aircraft carriers over

556
00:31:34,194 --> 00:31:36,096
and multiple squadrons
to the southern border

557
00:31:36,163 --> 00:31:38,332
- for "training exercises."
- I understand. However--

558
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:40,100
And I'm praying
that none of those men

559
00:31:40,167 --> 00:31:42,035
have to be sent over
to North Kiyung.

560
00:31:42,102 --> 00:31:43,605
I lost my husband there.

561
00:31:43,671 --> 00:31:45,540
And let's face it,
we don't exactly have

562
00:31:45,607 --> 00:31:48,843
invisible aircraft to navigate
around all those missiles.

563
00:31:48,909 --> 00:31:50,978
Well, the solution
we are working on

564
00:31:51,044 --> 00:31:53,013
is classified at the moment.

565
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,649
I can tell you
that we are looking

566
00:31:54,716 --> 00:31:56,950
for your best pilots

567
00:31:57,017 --> 00:31:59,554
with advanced
aerial capabilities.

568
00:31:59,621 --> 00:32:04,124
A squadron that can maneuver
through such conditions.

569
00:32:04,191 --> 00:32:06,093
Colonel, I can assure
you that we are working

570
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:08,195
on advanced maneuvering
with our pilots daily.

571
00:32:08,262 --> 00:32:09,898
However,
you're asking for a bird

572
00:32:09,963 --> 00:32:11,766
to fly through a hailstorm.

573
00:32:11,833 --> 00:32:14,836
This is not one or two missiles
we're talking about.

574
00:32:14,903 --> 00:32:17,171
I wish I could help you but
unfortunately, I don't have

575
00:32:17,237 --> 00:32:20,608
a squadron with those
capabilities aboard my ship.

576
00:32:20,675 --> 00:32:22,176
Sure you do.

577
00:32:26,614 --> 00:32:27,981
Absolutely not.

578
00:32:30,919 --> 00:32:33,053
With all due respect, Commander,

579
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,956
this is in the best interest
of the United States Government

580
00:32:36,023 --> 00:32:37,424
and the safety of its citizens.

581
00:32:37,491 --> 00:32:39,126
And with all due respect,
Colonel,

582
00:32:39,193 --> 00:32:40,895
you're asking me to volunteer
six women who are aerial

583
00:32:40,961 --> 00:32:43,363
stunt performers,
not combat aviators.

584
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:45,733
Besides, Lieutenant Riebach
would never agree to it.

585
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:48,268
She's a devoted Christian
and she won't participate

586
00:32:48,335 --> 00:32:51,506
in combat, hence, why she flies
for the aerial demo team.

587
00:32:51,573 --> 00:32:53,508
I was unaware
that we offer the program

588
00:32:53,575 --> 00:32:58,045
flying a $40 million aircraft
just for fun.

589
00:32:58,111 --> 00:33:00,380
They signed up
to protect our country.

590
00:33:00,447 --> 00:33:02,684
Our government trained them
for combat,

591
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:04,418
not for carnivals.

592
00:33:04,485 --> 00:33:07,287
I'm quite sure if
they refuse the order,

593
00:33:07,354 --> 00:33:09,456
they will be restricted
from flying.

594
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:13,460
And then, perhaps, we could
offer them a job at the mall,

595
00:33:14,729 --> 00:33:16,230
handing out Navy brochures

596
00:33:16,296 --> 00:33:18,600
or be suspended indefinitely.

597
00:33:19,901 --> 00:33:21,168
Yeah. That one's not gonna work.

598
00:33:21,235 --> 00:33:22,837
They're already suspended,

599
00:33:22,904 --> 00:33:24,304
by our government.

600
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:28,776
Well, Commander, I will have
an order on your desk

601
00:33:28,843 --> 00:33:31,546
by day's end tomorrow
to unsuspend them.

602
00:33:31,613 --> 00:33:34,181
And I can assure you,
I will have the total support

603
00:33:34,248 --> 00:33:35,984
from the Department of Defense

604
00:33:36,049 --> 00:33:37,351
and our National
Security Council

605
00:33:37,417 --> 00:33:39,286
to proceed with this operation.

606
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,322
You will be hearing
from us very soon.

607
00:33:42,389 --> 00:33:44,291
Good day, Commander.

608
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,903
Dude, what the hell?

609
00:33:54,969 --> 00:33:56,136
Dude, what did they teach you

610
00:33:56,203 --> 00:33:57,404
in basic training?
Come on.

611
00:33:57,471 --> 00:33:59,106
When's the last time
you shot a gun?

612
00:33:59,172 --> 00:34:00,808
Keep your arms straight.

613
00:34:03,176 --> 00:34:04,913
Try it again.

614
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,850
There's no way
I missed that again.

615
00:34:08,917 --> 00:34:10,685
There's gotta be something
wrong with the sights on.

616
00:34:12,887 --> 00:34:14,154
You scared the shit out of me.

617
00:34:14,221 --> 00:34:16,558
Nice shot.

618
00:34:16,624 --> 00:34:17,859
Try this one.

619
00:34:17,926 --> 00:34:19,561
They could take our wings
but definitely not our guns.

620
00:34:19,627 --> 00:34:21,461
What are you doing here?

621
00:34:22,496 --> 00:34:24,331
I thought you're spending
some time with your Dad.

622
00:34:24,398 --> 00:34:26,701
Yeah, well, Dad had a hot date

623
00:34:26,768 --> 00:34:28,570
with a bottle,
so I wasn't too welcome.

624
00:34:28,636 --> 00:34:30,738
- I'm sorry.
- No, it's fine.

625
00:34:30,805 --> 00:34:32,540
It's not like you guys
want my family anyway.

626
00:34:32,607 --> 00:34:35,342
That's right.
Wing Girls, fly or die.

627
00:34:35,409 --> 00:34:38,111
Oh, see?

628
00:34:38,178 --> 00:34:39,781
- Told you it was your gun.
- Whatever.

629
00:34:39,847 --> 00:34:41,481
- Listen, my piece don't miss.
- Come on. Let's go.

630
00:34:41,549 --> 00:34:43,417
Oh, hey, Country.
Is your Mom around?

631
00:34:43,483 --> 00:34:45,185
I was gonna say hello
and catch up?

632
00:34:45,252 --> 00:34:46,988
Yeah, she's inside,
uh, go ahead.

633
00:34:47,055 --> 00:34:48,790
We're gonna go take a quick ride
and we'll be right in.

634
00:34:48,856 --> 00:34:52,192
Kaden, Commander called.
She said it was important.

635
00:34:52,259 --> 00:34:54,062
I think you need
to return back to base.

636
00:34:54,127 --> 00:34:55,329
Well, whatever it is,

637
00:34:55,395 --> 00:34:57,799
I'm sure it can wait.

638
00:34:57,865 --> 00:34:59,601
I'm on my time now.

639
00:35:00,835 --> 00:35:04,772
Hee!

640
00:35:28,328 --> 00:35:29,998
As of 0600 hours,

641
00:35:30,064 --> 00:35:32,432
you are reinstated for duty.

642
00:35:32,499 --> 00:35:34,501
However,
for this particular assignment,

643
00:35:34,569 --> 00:35:36,436
you will be under
AFLR's command.

644
00:35:36,504 --> 00:35:38,305
May I ask a question, ma'am?

645
00:35:38,372 --> 00:35:40,108
- Go ahead.
- AFLR as in

646
00:35:40,173 --> 00:35:41,943
Air Force Last
Resort Operation Center?

647
00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:43,377
That's correct, Lieutenant.

648
00:35:43,443 --> 00:35:44,712
Would it be out of order

649
00:35:44,779 --> 00:35:46,380
to ask for additional details,
Commander?

650
00:35:46,446 --> 00:35:48,415
I don't have the details,
ladies.

651
00:35:48,482 --> 00:35:50,752
What I can tell you
is that the US Navy

652
00:35:50,818 --> 00:35:53,320
has agreed to assist
with this operation

653
00:35:53,387 --> 00:35:54,822
and we will be docking
on the Atlantic coast

654
00:35:54,889 --> 00:35:57,892
just outside
the operation center.

655
00:35:57,959 --> 00:36:00,327
The Colonel and his team
will be boarding the ship

656
00:36:00,394 --> 00:36:03,598
and running some
training exercises with you.

657
00:36:03,665 --> 00:36:06,166
Jeeter has been selected
as well.

658
00:36:08,036 --> 00:36:09,369
I expect you all to behave

659
00:36:09,436 --> 00:36:11,939
and represent yourselves
professionally.

660
00:36:12,006 --> 00:36:13,775
Leave your grudges at the door.

661
00:36:14,942 --> 00:36:16,410
I suggest you get some shut eye.

662
00:36:16,476 --> 00:36:17,545
I don't wanna
send them delirious,

663
00:36:17,612 --> 00:36:19,179
lazy-eyed pilots in the morning.

664
00:36:19,246 --> 00:36:21,549
Good night, ladies.

665
00:36:21,616 --> 00:36:22,617
Dismissed.

666
00:36:23,483 --> 00:36:25,553
I got a bad feeling about this.

667
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:29,590
No one goes to AFLR unless
they're going into combat.

668
00:36:29,657 --> 00:36:32,960
AFLR is boarding our ship,

669
00:36:33,027 --> 00:36:35,163
we aren't going anywhere,

670
00:36:35,228 --> 00:36:36,831
and that's not true, Bear.

671
00:36:36,898 --> 00:36:39,067
They may be just using us
for stand-ins during training

672
00:36:39,133 --> 00:36:41,334
or something, okay?

673
00:36:41,401 --> 00:36:43,871
Let's just wait
and see what happens tomorrow.

674
00:36:45,606 --> 00:36:48,076
But we finally get
an opportunity to do something

675
00:36:48,142 --> 00:36:50,243
and Jeeter has to come with us?

676
00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:51,713
Really?

677
00:36:51,779 --> 00:36:53,948
We can always say no, can't we?

678
00:36:54,015 --> 00:36:55,616
Don't work like that, Riddles.

679
00:36:55,683 --> 00:36:58,418
Once you sign those papers,
you basically gave them

680
00:36:58,485 --> 00:36:59,854
parental rights to your ass.

681
00:37:01,421 --> 00:37:02,957
Welcome to AFLR.

682
00:37:03,024 --> 00:37:05,526
I have to tell you I'm quite
excited that you all are here.

683
00:37:05,593 --> 00:37:07,729
It's not--it's not often
that we get a woman

684
00:37:07,795 --> 00:37:11,199
that comes through the Air
Force Last Resort program,

685
00:37:11,264 --> 00:37:13,500
so to have six of you

686
00:37:13,568 --> 00:37:16,704
is quite rare, so welcome.

687
00:37:16,771 --> 00:37:19,140
Since you're already
commissioned officers

688
00:37:19,207 --> 00:37:22,510
and well-respected pilots
for our service,

689
00:37:22,577 --> 00:37:24,946
I think we can just
kick the tires

690
00:37:25,012 --> 00:37:28,381
and light the fires,
and get this thing going.

691
00:37:29,316 --> 00:37:31,719
We're gonna be boarding your
carrier

692
00:37:31,786 --> 00:37:35,189
and running a series
of training exercises.

693
00:37:35,288 --> 00:37:36,791
And during this training time,

694
00:37:36,858 --> 00:37:40,460
you're gonna be under
Colonel Micklin's command.

695
00:37:42,329 --> 00:37:43,598
Lieutenant Riebach?

696
00:37:43,664 --> 00:37:45,600
Is anyone gonna explain to us

697
00:37:45,666 --> 00:37:47,802
what exactly we're doing here.

698
00:37:47,869 --> 00:37:50,037
Good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen.

699
00:37:50,104 --> 00:37:52,472
Thank you, Sergeant.

700
00:37:54,542 --> 00:37:56,409
I'm sure
you're all quite curious

701
00:37:56,476 --> 00:37:58,378
as to why the Air Force
Last Resort program

702
00:37:58,445 --> 00:38:00,648
is interested in your services.

703
00:38:00,715 --> 00:38:04,185
Soon enough, we will fill you in
on all those details.

704
00:38:04,252 --> 00:38:07,855
I need to see if you even fit
the criteria for the operation.

705
00:38:09,356 --> 00:38:11,559
I am seeking
the best of the best,

706
00:38:11,626 --> 00:38:15,830
and I expect nothing from you
other than everything.

707
00:38:17,297 --> 00:38:18,966
We didn't choose you,

708
00:38:19,033 --> 00:38:22,402
it was your exceptional skills
and abilities that did.

709
00:38:22,469 --> 00:38:26,406
Tomorrow, we're going
to test those abilities,

710
00:38:26,473 --> 00:38:28,408
only faster, harder,

711
00:38:28,475 --> 00:38:31,179
and perhaps deadlier
than you've ever imagined

712
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:35,482
because it's one thing
to serve your country,

713
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:38,119
but when you're called to duty,

714
00:38:38,186 --> 00:38:39,720
will you protect it?

715
00:38:42,023 --> 00:38:43,991
I want you all
to think about that.

716
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:51,799
- Hi.
- What's up, guys?

717
00:38:51,866 --> 00:38:54,501
- Welcome to AFLR.
- No way. What's up, man?

718
00:38:54,569 --> 00:38:55,770
- Hi, guys.
- Hi, guys.

719
00:38:55,837 --> 00:38:56,571
- How you guys doing?
- Hello.

720
00:38:56,637 --> 00:38:58,639
What's up, man?

721
00:38:58,706 --> 00:39:00,842
Baby, how you doin', dude?

722
00:39:00,908 --> 00:39:03,544
Damn, who would've thought
they're merging units, man?

723
00:39:03,611 --> 00:39:05,613
Oh, man.
Oh, they ain't with me.

724
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,648
Captain Middleton,
call sign Mooney.

725
00:39:07,715 --> 00:39:10,518
I'd love to hear
the story on that name sometime.

726
00:39:10,585 --> 00:39:14,121
Lieutenant Riebach,
call sign Country.

727
00:39:14,188 --> 00:39:16,324
This is Wiki, Edge, Riddles,

728
00:39:16,389 --> 00:39:17,959
Bear, and Riot.

729
00:39:18,025 --> 00:39:20,161
Riddles, huh?
You must be the comedic relief

730
00:39:20,228 --> 00:39:22,129
- of the bunch.
- I try.

731
00:39:22,196 --> 00:39:23,331
Just so y'all know,

732
00:39:23,396 --> 00:39:25,533
Superman ain't got nothin' me.

733
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,001
I'm just a call away.

734
00:39:28,336 --> 00:39:30,872
Travon Dixon, call sign Poet.

735
00:39:30,938 --> 00:39:33,574
Ah.
Who would've guessed?

736
00:39:33,641 --> 00:39:36,010
You guys wouldn't
happen to know, like,

737
00:39:36,077 --> 00:39:37,845
what we're doing here,
would you?

738
00:39:37,912 --> 00:39:40,081
Uh, it's just what
I was asking my pal, Baby, here.

739
00:39:40,147 --> 00:39:42,717
You know, what are we doing here
with the Charlie's Angels, man?

740
00:39:42,783 --> 00:39:44,619
You know, giving us

741
00:39:44,685 --> 00:39:46,486
- some eye candy, yeah.
- Oh, candy, no, man.

742
00:39:46,554 --> 00:39:48,723
That's sour candy,
the kind you spit back out.

743
00:39:48,789 --> 00:39:51,458
Come on, guys. Really?

744
00:39:51,525 --> 00:39:53,861
That's okay. Really,
we're used to it.

745
00:39:53,928 --> 00:39:56,097
Looks like
we got us another Jeeter.

746
00:39:56,163 --> 00:39:58,065
Great. As if one isn't enough.

747
00:39:58,132 --> 00:39:59,499
Hey, there.

748
00:39:59,567 --> 00:40:01,202
I guess you felt
a little left out.

749
00:40:01,269 --> 00:40:02,370
You know, that's my fault.

750
00:40:02,435 --> 00:40:04,138
I should've introduced myself.

751
00:40:04,205 --> 00:40:05,472
Lieutenant Lee.

752
00:40:06,439 --> 00:40:08,276
- Baby.
- I don't care.

753
00:40:09,644 --> 00:40:13,180
Jeeter, apologize to my sisters.

754
00:40:13,247 --> 00:40:15,016
We don't wanna be here with you

755
00:40:15,082 --> 00:40:17,551
any more than you want
to be here with us.

756
00:40:17,618 --> 00:40:20,988
But like it or not,
you are flying with us.

757
00:40:21,055 --> 00:40:24,125
So, how about we just smile
and get through this, yeah?

758
00:40:25,927 --> 00:40:27,662
Oh, I'm sorry.

759
00:40:28,596 --> 00:40:29,964
No, that's fine.

760
00:40:30,031 --> 00:40:32,033
I'll see you in the sky.

761
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:35,468
We're gonna have some fun.

762
00:40:37,505 --> 00:40:39,106
All right. Later, Country.

763
00:40:39,173 --> 00:40:40,473
See you, Bear.

764
00:40:40,541 --> 00:40:41,976
I'm telling you guys right now,

765
00:40:42,043 --> 00:40:43,878
Jeeter wants to keep
running his mouth acting like

766
00:40:43,945 --> 00:40:45,680
- he's--
- Oh, my gosh.

767
00:40:45,746 --> 00:40:47,114
- Oh, my gosh.
- Whoa.

768
00:40:47,181 --> 00:40:48,582
- I'm so sorry.
- Are you okay?

769
00:40:48,649 --> 00:40:49,482
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm good.

770
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:50,785
Uh, perfect actually.

771
00:40:50,851 --> 00:40:53,587
Captain Harris.
Call me Bells, please.

772
00:40:53,654 --> 00:40:56,357
Welcome to AFLR, ladies.
Major Nikoli here.

773
00:40:56,424 --> 00:40:59,060
We call him Shortstop.
There's no explanation needed.

774
00:40:59,126 --> 00:41:02,897
I'm, uh, Captain Billy.

775
00:41:02,964 --> 00:41:05,299
How do you do?
I, uh, call sign Clownz.

776
00:41:05,366 --> 00:41:07,435
The only clown but I'm always
hanging with a couple of jokes.

777
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,503
But, uh, gotta go

778
00:41:09,570 --> 00:41:10,871
save the world,
so I'm gonna leave you

779
00:41:10,938 --> 00:41:12,540
a couple of America's
best, yeah?

780
00:41:12,606 --> 00:41:13,841
Right.
Yeah. You go do that.

781
00:41:13,908 --> 00:41:15,276
- All right.
- All right. Yeah.

782
00:41:15,343 --> 00:41:17,477
Anyways, uh,

783
00:41:17,545 --> 00:41:19,013
it's awesome
to have you guys here.

784
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:20,181
I'm really excited.

785
00:41:20,247 --> 00:41:21,148
We were just talking about this.

786
00:41:21,215 --> 00:41:22,316
I gotta admit,

787
00:41:22,383 --> 00:41:23,517
I'm a little star struck.

788
00:41:23,584 --> 00:41:25,686
I, uh, been watching you guys

789
00:41:25,753 --> 00:41:27,288
in your last few shows.

790
00:41:27,355 --> 00:41:28,756
It's pretty impressive.

791
00:41:28,823 --> 00:41:30,524
Well, thank you. I am sure

792
00:41:30,591 --> 00:41:32,693
you're pretty good yourself.

793
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:35,730
I am. And I'm gonna make
you guys better.

794
00:41:35,796 --> 00:41:37,098
He can ring my bell any day.

795
00:41:37,164 --> 00:41:39,066
I concur.

796
00:41:39,133 --> 00:41:41,669
- Really, guys?
- Yeah, well, who knows?

797
00:41:41,736 --> 00:41:43,404
Maybe we'll make you better.

798
00:41:45,272 --> 00:41:48,476
We'll just--we'll just
forget about that

799
00:41:48,542 --> 00:41:50,578
and...
how about we compromise,

800
00:41:50,644 --> 00:41:52,079
let's say we'll make
a good team?

801
00:41:52,146 --> 00:41:54,782
Yeah. Let's see
how good you fly first.

802
00:41:55,783 --> 00:41:58,319
Lady's got some bite.
I like it.

803
00:41:58,386 --> 00:42:00,955
Yeah. On that note,
we're gonna hit the showers.

804
00:42:01,022 --> 00:42:03,124
See you guys up in the clouds?

805
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:05,292
I think I'm already
in the clouds.

806
00:42:08,562 --> 00:42:11,232
<i>Uh, check to the 3-6-0.</i>

807
00:42:21,075 --> 00:42:24,011
Feels good to be back up here,
doesn't it, Bear?

808
00:42:24,078 --> 00:42:26,280
Who the hell changed
the station on my radio?

809
00:42:28,149 --> 00:42:30,519
I don't know, but my seat
is a little reclined back.

810
00:42:30,584 --> 00:42:32,153
<i>That was probably Riot.</i>

811
00:42:32,219 --> 00:42:34,922
She knows all
about reclined seats.

812
00:42:34,989 --> 00:42:35,923
Guys.

813
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:37,091
Ha, ha.

814
00:42:38,859 --> 00:42:40,227
Kill the chatter, girls.

815
00:42:40,294 --> 00:42:42,596
You heard the Colonel,
zero tolerance.

816
00:42:42,663 --> 00:42:43,798
<i>There are two persons</i>
<i>of interest</i>

817
00:42:43,864 --> 00:42:45,466
parked on top of Devil's Ridge.

818
00:42:45,534 --> 00:42:46,667
I need you to fly over there

819
00:42:46,734 --> 00:42:48,002
<i>and get their ugly photographs.</i>

820
00:42:48,069 --> 00:42:49,170
Copy?

821
00:42:49,236 --> 00:42:50,337
That's it?

822
00:42:50,404 --> 00:42:52,740
Damn. Okay. Easy first day.

823
00:42:52,807 --> 00:42:55,042
What? Air Force
doesn't have enough money

824
00:42:55,109 --> 00:42:57,211
for a wedding photographer,
Colonel?

825
00:42:57,278 --> 00:42:59,313
<i>Angry Birds, your mission is</i>

826
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:00,848
<i>to prevent them from getting it.</i>

827
00:43:00,915 --> 00:43:02,349
Angry Birds? What?

828
00:43:05,653 --> 00:43:09,356
We got two eagles
and a warning, incoming.

829
00:43:09,423 --> 00:43:11,292
Now this is one Charlie Foxtrot

830
00:43:11,358 --> 00:43:12,726
that I don't mind.

831
00:43:12,793 --> 00:43:14,862
And I agree this is gonna be
an easy first day.

832
00:43:14,929 --> 00:43:16,263
All right, gentlemen.

833
00:43:16,330 --> 00:43:18,533
Let's keep it clean
up here, okay?

834
00:43:18,599 --> 00:43:21,168
All right,
Jeeter, Baby, and Bells.

835
00:43:21,235 --> 00:43:23,304
It's okay.
Bear, Edge, and Riddles,

836
00:43:23,370 --> 00:43:25,439
you guys are gonna be
the fly swat on the rear,

837
00:43:25,507 --> 00:43:26,907
keeping them busy.

838
00:43:26,974 --> 00:43:28,676
I'll take Wiki and Riot
to the objective. Copy?

839
00:43:28,742 --> 00:43:30,911
- Game on.
- Let's get it going.

840
00:43:30,978 --> 00:43:35,349
Operation Mug Shot
begins in three, two, one.

841
00:43:40,221 --> 00:43:43,624
<i>I see 'em, three of 'em.</i>
<i>12:00 high.</i>

842
00:43:43,691 --> 00:43:45,493
Right behind you, Mooney,
on your 6:00.

843
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:48,195
Careful, boys. I know them,
they're planning something.

844
00:43:49,396 --> 00:43:50,998
We're moving fast, girls.

845
00:43:52,833 --> 00:43:54,969
I'll take left.
Riddles take right.

846
00:43:55,035 --> 00:43:57,938
Bear, keep point.
Keep them off Country.

847
00:43:58,005 --> 00:43:59,373
I'm gonna skim the deck.

848
00:44:04,879 --> 00:44:06,914
I'm taking them down.

849
00:44:06,981 --> 00:44:09,483
Hey. They ain't gonna
go that easy, Mooney.

850
00:44:09,551 --> 00:44:12,720
All right, ladies.
Time to open the umbrella.

851
00:44:12,786 --> 00:44:14,121
- Got lock.
- Take it.

852
00:44:14,188 --> 00:44:17,691
Dammit.

853
00:44:17,758 --> 00:44:19,193
That went well.

854
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:21,295
I'm going low and right.

855
00:44:24,431 --> 00:44:27,034
Already on it, Jeeter.
Get your own.

856
00:44:28,702 --> 00:44:30,037
<i>I ain't bailing, no way.</i>

857
00:44:32,106 --> 00:44:35,544
Time to light the fires
and take 'em higher.

858
00:44:38,145 --> 00:44:40,748
- And there she goes.
- Don't lose her, Jeeter.

859
00:44:40,814 --> 00:44:42,316
Quit your whining, I see her,

860
00:44:42,383 --> 00:44:44,385
and now I know
why they call you Baby.

861
00:44:46,621 --> 00:44:47,755
Talk to me, Bear.

862
00:44:47,821 --> 00:44:48,889
We're gonna end this right now.

863
00:44:48,956 --> 00:44:50,257
Right above you, guys.

864
00:44:50,324 --> 00:44:51,992
He's all over me.

865
00:44:52,826 --> 00:44:54,762
Okay, girls. I got a maneuver

866
00:44:54,828 --> 00:44:56,397
that's gonna put us
right behind them.

867
00:44:56,463 --> 00:44:58,465
But, Bear,
I'm gonna need you to dive

868
00:44:58,533 --> 00:44:59,800
right between me and Riddles.

869
00:44:59,867 --> 00:45:01,235
Remember the Dosey Doe?

870
00:45:01,302 --> 00:45:03,672
The Dosey? Are you nuts?
They could hit us head-on.

871
00:45:03,737 --> 00:45:05,372
Edge, that's not a good idea.

872
00:45:05,439 --> 00:45:07,609
It won't work if only three
of you know the routine.

873
00:45:07,676 --> 00:45:08,943
It's too risky.

874
00:45:09,009 --> 00:45:10,645
All planes
have to be choreographed.

875
00:45:10,711 --> 00:45:12,146
We're almost at the objective.

876
00:45:12,213 --> 00:45:14,315
- Sit tight, girls.
- How about you focus

877
00:45:14,381 --> 00:45:16,685
on taking pictures
and I'll focus

878
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:18,018
on keeping them off your ass?

879
00:45:18,085 --> 00:45:20,522
Bear, dive now.

880
00:45:20,589 --> 00:45:24,258
Oh, hell no.

881
00:45:25,125 --> 00:45:27,494
Dammit Edge.
Country, I'm going to help them.

882
00:45:27,562 --> 00:45:29,797
Do not leave my wing,
they'll handle themselves.

883
00:45:29,863 --> 00:45:31,065
On my way, ladies.

884
00:45:33,334 --> 00:45:35,803
<i>I see you guys.</i>

885
00:45:35,869 --> 00:45:38,138
- Talk to me fast.
- As soon as we meet,

886
00:45:38,205 --> 00:45:39,406
you're dead.

887
00:45:40,908 --> 00:45:42,443
Buckle up
my little hamburger helper,

888
00:45:42,510 --> 00:45:44,945
we might be scraping
a little paint.

889
00:45:47,848 --> 00:45:49,984
What the hell
are these girls up to now?

890
00:45:50,050 --> 00:45:52,019
It's too close. Spread out.
It's too close, Edge.

891
00:45:52,086 --> 00:45:55,222
Let's see if these guys
can Dosey Doe.

892
00:45:55,289 --> 00:45:56,757
Wait, wait, wait,
right arm or left arm?

893
00:45:56,824 --> 00:45:58,727
It's too damn close.

894
00:45:58,792 --> 00:46:00,629
Always left arm, always.

895
00:46:00,695 --> 00:46:02,963
- Three...
- Edge?

896
00:46:03,030 --> 00:46:04,666
This is not gonna end good.

897
00:46:04,733 --> 00:46:06,834
<i>I'm coming in, 3:00,</i>
<i>through the middle.</i>

898
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:08,469
Captain, we should pull out.

899
00:46:08,536 --> 00:46:10,037
Two...

900
00:46:10,104 --> 00:46:11,972
We need to pull out now.

901
00:46:12,039 --> 00:46:13,207
Everybody, knock it off.

902
00:46:13,274 --> 00:46:14,875
This is not an air show.
Let's go.

903
00:46:14,942 --> 00:46:16,410
<i>Warning, warning, warning,</i>

904
00:46:16,477 --> 00:46:19,213
<i>warning, warning,</i>
<i>warning, warning.</i>

905
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:21,181
Dammit.

906
00:46:21,248 --> 00:46:22,983
- One.
- Look out.

907
00:46:23,050 --> 00:46:24,785
- Whoa.
- Look out -

908
00:46:24,852 --> 00:46:27,187
<i>Ha-ha, damn that was close.</i>

909
00:46:27,254 --> 00:46:29,857
<i>Woo. Dosey Doe!</i>

910
00:46:29,923 --> 00:46:32,493
These girls are all
over the damn place.

911
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:33,927
I told you.

912
00:46:33,994 --> 00:46:35,530
<i>Lock 'em and dock 'em, team.</i>

913
00:46:36,765 --> 00:46:38,832
Splash one.

914
00:46:38,899 --> 00:46:41,302
- Shit.
- Mooney is called Boomey,

915
00:46:41,368 --> 00:46:43,505
<i>game over.</i>

916
00:46:43,571 --> 00:46:45,674
Let's make that two.

917
00:46:45,740 --> 00:46:47,074
Poet you're through.

918
00:46:49,109 --> 00:46:50,811
<i>Splash one.</i>

919
00:46:50,878 --> 00:46:52,313
Woo! Ah!

920
00:46:52,379 --> 00:46:54,481
Jeeter and Baby
are out of there.

921
00:46:54,549 --> 00:46:56,417
Back to the birdhouse boys.

922
00:46:58,218 --> 00:47:00,187
There's our objective.

923
00:47:00,254 --> 00:47:03,223
Let's see who our guests
of honor are today.

924
00:47:03,290 --> 00:47:04,892
Say cheese.

925
00:47:14,134 --> 00:47:17,237
Wing Girls, one.
Angry Birds, zero.

926
00:47:21,208 --> 00:47:23,110
Good job today, guys.

927
00:47:23,177 --> 00:47:27,348
Pucker factor was definitely
high, but good job.

928
00:47:31,151 --> 00:47:34,488
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

929
00:47:53,641 --> 00:47:55,777
I appreciate you.

930
00:47:55,844 --> 00:47:57,077
I do.

931
00:47:58,278 --> 00:48:02,316
I would take a missile for you
and you know that.

932
00:48:03,917 --> 00:48:07,321
The next time
you disobey my order,

933
00:48:07,388 --> 00:48:10,090
I am dismissing you
from this team.

934
00:48:11,325 --> 00:48:13,561
Do I make my myself clear?

935
00:48:15,996 --> 00:48:17,498
Crystal.

936
00:48:27,007 --> 00:48:29,910
What I saw today
is unacceptable.

937
00:48:31,178 --> 00:48:33,113
You all have to remember

938
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:35,949
that you may serve
under two branches,

939
00:48:36,016 --> 00:48:38,485
but you fly under one flag.

940
00:48:40,487 --> 00:48:43,591
We are the last line of defense
to this country.

941
00:48:45,058 --> 00:48:46,561
He's protecting your family.

942
00:48:46,628 --> 00:48:48,362
She's protecting yours.

943
00:48:50,297 --> 00:48:52,366
So, when the alarms
are going off,

944
00:48:52,433 --> 00:48:55,603
and that MiG is preventing you
from seeing your family again,

945
00:48:55,670 --> 00:48:58,305
it's not gonna matter
who's saving you,

946
00:48:58,372 --> 00:49:01,108
if it's a male or a female.

947
00:49:04,111 --> 00:49:05,847
You can ask any pilot,

948
00:49:05,914 --> 00:49:08,683
any pilot that's had a missile
or a MiG locked onto them,

949
00:49:08,750 --> 00:49:12,152
that feeling you feel,
it's indescribable.

950
00:49:14,789 --> 00:49:17,692
Dramatic situations bring people
together, unfortunately.

951
00:49:18,893 --> 00:49:20,260
So, let's start now.

952
00:49:20,327 --> 00:49:23,263
Let's not wait
for the alarms to go off.

953
00:49:26,835 --> 00:49:28,703
Colonel?

954
00:49:28,770 --> 00:49:31,138
The only thing you managed
to prove to me

955
00:49:31,205 --> 00:49:33,340
is that these girls
can take a picture

956
00:49:33,407 --> 00:49:36,611
and their lack of communication
in that ridiculous maneuver

957
00:49:36,678 --> 00:49:40,347
that almost cost six lives
and six aircraft, Colonel.

958
00:49:40,414 --> 00:49:43,417
- But it didn't, did it?
- Thank God, no. Had it?

959
00:49:43,484 --> 00:49:45,452
I'd be talking to you
from behind a plate glass window

960
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:47,221
- in prison right now.
- You haven't even seen

961
00:49:47,287 --> 00:49:48,790
- what they can do yet.
- I don't know.

962
00:49:48,857 --> 00:49:50,758
And if I'm not mistaken,

963
00:49:50,825 --> 00:49:52,292
we gave them a mission today,

964
00:49:52,359 --> 00:49:53,828
and it was completed.

965
00:49:53,895 --> 00:49:56,698
And that's what
we train our military to do.

966
00:49:56,764 --> 00:49:59,366
Get the job done, isn't it?

967
00:49:59,433 --> 00:50:00,668
Colonel,

968
00:50:00,735 --> 00:50:02,436
do I need to remind you
where you are

969
00:50:02,504 --> 00:50:05,005
and who you are speaking to?

970
00:50:05,773 --> 00:50:07,374
Now, proceed.

971
00:50:09,076 --> 00:50:10,812
- Bear.
- Hey, Margo.

972
00:50:10,879 --> 00:50:11,713
What's up?

973
00:50:11,779 --> 00:50:13,948
Taegan, wait.

974
00:50:16,416 --> 00:50:18,485
Look...

975
00:50:18,553 --> 00:50:22,289
you know if I thought
for even a second

976
00:50:22,356 --> 00:50:25,292
that if I was putting you
in harm's way,

977
00:50:25,359 --> 00:50:27,127
I wouldn't have done it.

978
00:50:29,029 --> 00:50:33,033
This team is literally
all that I have.

979
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:35,335
So, uh...

980
00:50:37,539 --> 00:50:40,040
I just wanted you to know that.

981
00:50:41,643 --> 00:50:42,710
I know that, Edge.

982
00:50:44,812 --> 00:50:46,213
Cool.

983
00:50:55,455 --> 00:50:56,423
So, they didn't fill you in

984
00:50:56,490 --> 00:50:57,992
on why you're here, I suppose?

985
00:50:58,058 --> 00:51:01,930
I was thinking they wanted us
to fly the new F-35s.

986
00:51:01,996 --> 00:51:04,732
Ain't for no F-35s.

987
00:51:04,799 --> 00:51:06,066
See all that?

988
00:51:06,901 --> 00:51:08,770
That's what scares me.

989
00:51:08,836 --> 00:51:11,806
No. We're an air show team.

990
00:51:11,873 --> 00:51:13,173
We don't--

991
00:51:14,842 --> 00:51:16,476
no.

992
00:51:16,544 --> 00:51:18,445
My girls and I don't do combat.

993
00:51:18,513 --> 00:51:22,082
Unfortunately, you don't have
that choice if you're here.

994
00:51:22,149 --> 00:51:23,551
Just keep that
in the back of your mind.

995
00:51:25,319 --> 00:51:27,454
It's all so dark
and mysterious

996
00:51:27,522 --> 00:51:30,525
when the one you want
doesn't want you, too.

997
00:51:33,628 --> 00:51:34,996
Cute.

998
00:51:35,063 --> 00:51:36,564
Is that one yours?

999
00:51:36,631 --> 00:51:38,066
Backstreet Boys.

1000
00:51:38,131 --> 00:51:40,068
He's got charm.

1001
00:51:40,133 --> 00:51:41,970
You gotta give him that.

1002
00:51:42,036 --> 00:51:45,039
Well, well, well.
Who we got here?

1003
00:51:45,105 --> 00:51:48,743
It's the legendary Wasps.

1004
00:51:51,445 --> 00:51:53,815
This is the crazy one. Tell me.

1005
00:51:53,881 --> 00:51:55,282
How did it feel

1006
00:51:55,349 --> 00:51:58,352
to bump your head
falling from heaven, huh?

1007
00:51:59,887 --> 00:52:01,488
Well, I didn't fall from heaven.

1008
00:52:01,556 --> 00:52:04,424
But I did scrape up my knees
and my legs pretty good

1009
00:52:04,491 --> 00:52:06,527
crawling out of hell.

1010
00:52:06,594 --> 00:52:08,395
Something wrong with this girl.

1011
00:52:08,462 --> 00:52:09,429
Come on.

1012
00:52:09,496 --> 00:52:11,264
Look. You girls, you--

1013
00:52:11,331 --> 00:52:15,135
you're a government-funded
gimmick, all right?

1014
00:52:15,202 --> 00:52:16,871
Look. I don't know
whose daddy knows

1015
00:52:16,938 --> 00:52:19,339
whose daddy to get you here,

1016
00:52:19,406 --> 00:52:22,242
but don't you put my life
in jeopardy again, all right?

1017
00:52:22,309 --> 00:52:24,879
If I'm not mistaken,
you were chasing us.

1018
00:52:24,946 --> 00:52:26,681
So, say it like it is.

1019
00:52:26,748 --> 00:52:31,218
You're mad because you were
outsmarted by a bunch of women.

1020
00:52:31,284 --> 00:52:33,054
- Okay. Okay.
- I see.

1021
00:52:33,121 --> 00:52:34,589
- That's enough.
- Yeah.

1022
00:52:34,656 --> 00:52:36,090
Don't be screwing the pooch
on this one.

1023
00:52:36,156 --> 00:52:37,491
That's fine, man.

1024
00:52:37,558 --> 00:52:39,060
I'm out of this
pig palace anyway.

1025
00:52:39,127 --> 00:52:40,061
Come on.

1026
00:52:40,128 --> 00:52:40,895
Go back to your bitches, Jeeter.

1027
00:52:40,962 --> 00:52:42,329
Yeah.

1028
00:52:44,197 --> 00:52:45,332
Don't mind him.

1029
00:52:45,399 --> 00:52:47,367
He's in heat and he's miserable.

1030
00:52:48,670 --> 00:52:52,040
- To Wing Girls.
- Wing Girls.

1031
00:52:52,106 --> 00:52:53,675
<i>Okay, ladies.</i>

1032
00:52:53,741 --> 00:52:55,610
<i>In today's training exercise,</i>
<i>we're going to focus</i>

1033
00:52:55,677 --> 00:52:57,612
<i>on your air-to-ground</i>
<i>precision skills.</i>

1034
00:52:57,679 --> 00:53:00,180
<i>This will be missiles only.</i>

1035
00:53:00,247 --> 00:53:03,818
<i>Proceed through the canyons,</i>
<i>to the convoy target.</i>

1036
00:53:03,885 --> 00:53:04,852
<i>Take it out.</i>

1037
00:53:13,193 --> 00:53:15,228
Oops, a little rusty. Sorry.

1038
00:53:15,295 --> 00:53:18,432
Circle back around
and get in line.

1039
00:53:18,498 --> 00:53:20,968
Lieutenant Rossi,
you are go for your attack run.

1040
00:53:24,839 --> 00:53:25,840
Copy that.

1041
00:53:34,082 --> 00:53:38,351
Target visual, and fire.

1042
00:53:42,322 --> 00:53:43,558
Shit.

1043
00:53:46,226 --> 00:53:47,829
Just to clarify,

1044
00:53:47,895 --> 00:53:50,098
this is the squadron
we're sending into North Kiyung

1045
00:53:50,164 --> 00:53:51,566
in a few days?

1046
00:53:53,233 --> 00:53:55,870
Lieutenant Beckett,
initiate your attack run.

1047
00:53:55,937 --> 00:53:57,605
Copy that.

1048
00:54:07,949 --> 00:54:09,884
Switching to guns.

1049
00:54:11,085 --> 00:54:12,419
What the hell is she doing?

1050
00:54:12,486 --> 00:54:14,021
Target acquired.

1051
00:54:14,088 --> 00:54:16,824
Negative, Lieutenant.
This is missiles only.

1052
00:54:22,196 --> 00:54:23,263
Damn. That felt good.

1053
00:54:23,330 --> 00:54:24,866
Nice one, Riddles.

1054
00:54:26,968 --> 00:54:28,002
Bring them home.

1055
00:54:28,069 --> 00:54:30,437
I've seen enough.
Send the girls packing.

1056
00:54:30,505 --> 00:54:34,274
<i>Oh, you said missile.</i>

1057
00:54:34,341 --> 00:54:37,211
We thought you said miss all.

1058
00:54:37,277 --> 00:54:38,246
That's what it sounded
like to me.

1059
00:54:38,311 --> 00:54:39,479
That's what I heard.

1060
00:54:39,547 --> 00:54:41,348
Well, hell,
coming right up.

1061
00:55:05,873 --> 00:55:07,208
FOX 2.

1062
00:55:07,275 --> 00:55:08,475
Fire, FOX 2.

1063
00:55:10,912 --> 00:55:12,345
Woo!

1064
00:55:15,683 --> 00:55:17,518
<i>What else you got,</i>
<i>command?</i>

1065
00:55:19,352 --> 00:55:24,125
Tomorrow, you will advance
to stage three of your training.

1066
00:55:24,192 --> 00:55:26,961
Now as a squadron,
you are very advanced

1067
00:55:27,028 --> 00:55:29,931
and certainly an asset
to this operation.

1068
00:55:29,997 --> 00:55:32,767
But, individually,

1069
00:55:32,834 --> 00:55:35,803
you are lacking a lot
of combat experience.

1070
00:55:35,870 --> 00:55:36,938
Operation?

1071
00:55:37,004 --> 00:55:39,640
Today, your ability
to follow orders

1072
00:55:39,707 --> 00:55:41,843
was both disappointing
and embarrassing.

1073
00:55:41,909 --> 00:55:45,947
Whether it was one of you
or six of you,

1074
00:55:46,013 --> 00:55:48,616
it's still unacceptable.

1075
00:55:48,683 --> 00:55:50,518
So with that being said,

1076
00:55:50,585 --> 00:55:52,820
none of you
will be flying anything

1077
00:55:52,887 --> 00:55:56,324
if you don't start
working together as one.

1078
00:55:56,389 --> 00:55:58,092
I suggest you all take
tomorrow off

1079
00:55:58,159 --> 00:56:00,595
and find something
you can do together

1080
00:56:00,661 --> 00:56:04,098
to set your differences aside
and get along.

1081
00:56:04,165 --> 00:56:05,533
You can't fight the enemy

1082
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:08,401
if you're too busy
fighting yourselves.

1083
00:57:41,429 --> 00:57:44,098
He did say operation.

1084
00:57:44,165 --> 00:57:45,533
What does that mean?

1085
00:57:45,599 --> 00:57:47,467
Definitely eliminates
the possibility

1086
00:57:47,535 --> 00:57:49,337
of training for new jets.

1087
00:57:49,403 --> 00:57:51,839
They can't possibly think
that we're capable of flying

1088
00:57:51,906 --> 00:57:54,474
in any type of physical
combative operation.

1089
00:57:54,542 --> 00:57:57,244
They have 17,000 pilots
in the service.

1090
00:57:57,311 --> 00:57:59,146
Yup.

1091
00:57:59,213 --> 00:58:00,815
And only 700 women.

1092
00:58:00,881 --> 00:58:02,717
Six of them are right here.

1093
00:58:02,783 --> 00:58:05,653
Would you guys
listen to yourselves?

1094
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:07,722
You're pilots
for the United States Navy,

1095
00:58:07,788 --> 00:58:09,890
and if you have a chance
to go down in history

1096
00:58:09,957 --> 00:58:14,328
protecting your country,
you do it.

1097
00:58:14,395 --> 00:58:15,930
Down in history, yeah.

1098
00:58:15,997 --> 00:58:19,200
Down behind enemy lines?

1099
00:58:19,266 --> 00:58:20,434
Yeah, I just don't know.

1100
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:21,802
As the United States
plans to meet

1101
00:58:21,869 --> 00:58:23,437
with the President
of Xiangyu today,

1102
00:58:23,504 --> 00:58:25,006
Kin Huan has tested a rocket
believed to be capable

1103
00:58:25,072 --> 00:58:28,642
of mounting
onto the ICBM missile

1104
00:58:28,709 --> 00:58:31,612
that he says
"will turn Americans to ashes."

1105
00:58:31,679 --> 00:58:33,981
Uh, yeah. Speaking of.

1106
00:58:37,184 --> 00:58:39,620
You might wanna reconsider
that statement.

1107
00:58:40,821 --> 00:58:42,223
I mean, it's ridiculous.

1108
00:58:42,289 --> 00:58:44,625
I don't know how he just
hasn't told them how it is.

1109
00:58:44,692 --> 00:58:46,127
We're going to battle.

1110
00:58:46,193 --> 00:58:48,596
No one's saying you're wrong
for saying that.

1111
00:58:48,662 --> 00:58:50,131
Somebody need
to tell these girls this,

1112
00:58:50,197 --> 00:58:52,600
get their mind
in the right place.

1113
00:58:52,666 --> 00:58:55,302
But unfortunately, you, I, us,

1114
00:58:55,369 --> 00:58:57,738
we don't wear the medals
to make that decision.

1115
00:58:57,805 --> 00:58:59,740
I mean, they're out here,
acting all reckless

1116
00:58:59,807 --> 00:59:03,978
like it's some damn spring break
freakin' air show.

1117
00:59:04,045 --> 00:59:07,681
You can't do that.
This is war, baby.

1118
00:59:07,748 --> 00:59:10,184
There's no choreography in war.

1119
00:59:10,251 --> 00:59:11,419
That's right.

1120
00:59:11,485 --> 00:59:14,655
If that missile wants you,
it's gonna get you.

1121
00:59:14,722 --> 00:59:16,857
Or die trying.

1122
00:59:16,924 --> 00:59:18,325
If Colonel thought
they weren't good enough,

1123
00:59:18,392 --> 00:59:19,460
they wouldn't be here.

1124
00:59:19,528 --> 00:59:21,862
Hey, what are we, chopped liver?

1125
00:59:21,929 --> 00:59:24,031
You're a nurse, not a pilot.

1126
00:59:24,098 --> 00:59:25,466
Whoa.

1127
00:59:25,534 --> 00:59:27,034
Big difference.

1128
00:59:27,101 --> 00:59:28,669
I'm gonna go talk to him
right now.

1129
00:59:28,736 --> 00:59:30,905
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1130
00:59:30,971 --> 00:59:32,606
What did you and I
talk about, man?

1131
00:59:32,673 --> 00:59:35,009
Remember, remember,
daddy-daughter time.

1132
00:59:35,076 --> 00:59:36,944
Go spend your time
with your daughter.

1133
00:59:37,011 --> 00:59:38,612
When you come back,
then we'll deal with all this.

1134
00:59:38,679 --> 00:59:40,347
- Right.
- Families first.

1135
00:59:40,414 --> 00:59:41,916
Right.

1136
00:59:41,982 --> 00:59:44,218
I'm gonna go hit the showers,
see you guys in a week.

1137
00:59:44,285 --> 00:59:45,319
All right.

1138
00:59:47,088 --> 00:59:48,122
Good luck.

1139
00:59:50,925 --> 00:59:55,530
Let's give them the Raptor.

1140
00:59:55,596 --> 00:59:58,466
Incoming.

1141
00:59:58,533 --> 01:00:01,202
F-22.

1142
01:00:01,268 --> 01:00:02,537
<i>Let me guess.</i>

1143
01:00:02,603 --> 01:00:03,938
They want us
to catch that thing.

1144
01:00:04,004 --> 01:00:06,273
Wing Girls, you're clear
to simulate engagement.

1145
01:00:06,340 --> 01:00:08,042
Let's paint it.

1146
01:00:10,811 --> 01:00:12,313
No joy.
Country, you got it?

1147
01:00:12,379 --> 01:00:13,614
Negative.

1148
01:00:18,652 --> 01:00:19,720
I got 'em.

1149
01:00:26,227 --> 01:00:28,062
Shit! Lost 'em.

1150
01:00:29,330 --> 01:00:30,898
I got 'em, Edge.

1151
01:00:34,802 --> 01:00:36,804
Lost 'em. Damn it!

1152
01:00:36,871 --> 01:00:38,372
Where'd he go?

1153
01:00:43,144 --> 01:00:45,379
If this isn't the shit show
of all shit shows.

1154
01:00:48,349 --> 01:00:50,484
Excuse me, Council.
You need to take this.

1155
01:00:50,552 --> 01:00:51,886
It's Washington.

1156
01:00:53,522 --> 01:00:54,822
Mr. President.

1157
01:00:58,058 --> 01:01:01,128
Understood, sir.
Twenty-four hours.

1158
01:01:04,633 --> 01:01:07,868
North Kiyung just launched
a long-range missile.

1159
01:01:07,935 --> 01:01:11,105
Get them out of the sky,
we attack in 72 hours.

1160
01:01:11,172 --> 01:01:13,741
We could use a little more time.

1161
01:01:13,807 --> 01:01:15,610
We're not near
close to ready yet.

1162
01:01:15,676 --> 01:01:18,279
Well, I suggest
you get them ready.

1163
01:01:18,345 --> 01:01:22,883
There is a long-range ICBM
in the air as we speak.

1164
01:01:22,950 --> 01:01:24,718
God-willing it's just a test,

1165
01:01:24,785 --> 01:01:27,054
but it might not be
the next time.

1166
01:01:27,121 --> 01:01:29,790
Now, these girls were your plan.

1167
01:01:29,857 --> 01:01:31,158
Break the news to them.

1168
01:01:31,225 --> 01:01:33,460
Their next air show
is over North Kiyung.

1169
01:02:12,132 --> 01:02:15,537
As you know, we have a situation

1170
01:02:15,604 --> 01:02:19,406
that is escalating rather
quickly with North Kiyung,

1171
01:02:20,874 --> 01:02:25,746
a threat that needs to be
addressed immediately.

1172
01:02:25,813 --> 01:02:27,515
Told you.

1173
01:02:27,582 --> 01:02:30,084
The training exercises
you've participated in

1174
01:02:30,150 --> 01:02:32,253
over the last few days

1175
01:02:32,319 --> 01:02:36,490
were crucial in determining
the success of this mission.

1176
01:02:38,993 --> 01:02:44,365
We are confident that each
and every one of you

1177
01:02:44,431 --> 01:02:49,571
will be able to provide
the air superiority we need

1178
01:02:49,638 --> 01:02:51,740
to keep this country safe

1179
01:02:51,805 --> 01:02:54,875
and end this threat immediately.

1180
01:02:59,246 --> 01:03:00,814
Ms. Daley?

1181
01:03:07,054 --> 01:03:09,323
Gentlemen and ladies,

1182
01:03:10,858 --> 01:03:14,361
I'm going to dispense
with the sugarcoating material,

1183
01:03:14,428 --> 01:03:16,063
and I'm gonna throw it
all out on the table

1184
01:03:16,130 --> 01:03:19,967
as boldly
and as clearly as I can.

1185
01:03:21,902 --> 01:03:23,672
Thirty minutes ago,

1186
01:03:23,738 --> 01:03:25,774
North Kiyung announced

1187
01:03:25,839 --> 01:03:28,409
that they will be
firing missiles at Guama.

1188
01:03:29,877 --> 01:03:31,680
We have just learned

1189
01:03:31,746 --> 01:03:34,549
that they are now
a nuclear power.

1190
01:03:35,784 --> 01:03:41,488
They have repeatedly threatened
our families here at home.

1191
01:03:41,556 --> 01:03:44,425
This is unacceptable,

1192
01:03:44,491 --> 01:03:46,093
and they must be stopped.

1193
01:03:47,161 --> 01:03:50,964
If you are sitting in this room,

1194
01:03:51,031 --> 01:03:54,201
you are the answer.

1195
01:03:55,603 --> 01:03:57,438
By ignoring this threat,

1196
01:03:57,505 --> 01:03:59,808
you are putting your country
in jeopardy

1197
01:03:59,873 --> 01:04:02,843
of a nuclear attack.

1198
01:04:02,910 --> 01:04:06,447
You are going to be flying
in the most dangerous skies

1199
01:04:06,514 --> 01:04:07,481
in the world.

1200
01:04:09,249 --> 01:04:14,288
The chances of survival,
on a scale of one to ten,

1201
01:04:14,355 --> 01:04:15,557
is a four.

1202
01:04:17,157 --> 01:04:21,962
In three days,
you will attack North Kiyung.

1203
01:04:22,029 --> 01:04:24,264
- Wait, what?
- Is this really happening?

1204
01:04:27,802 --> 01:04:29,870
We do not accept these orders.

1205
01:04:31,071 --> 01:04:32,306
Excuse me?

1206
01:04:35,543 --> 01:04:37,579
I apologize, Council.

1207
01:04:37,645 --> 01:04:41,115
But my squadron is not
a combat squadron.

1208
01:04:41,181 --> 01:04:42,717
We were brought here
without a clue

1209
01:04:42,784 --> 01:04:46,353
as to why we were being trained
and had I known

1210
01:04:46,420 --> 01:04:47,988
that we were gonna be
sent to combat,

1211
01:04:48,055 --> 01:04:50,290
I would've refused
from the very beginning.

1212
01:04:52,459 --> 01:04:53,828
Colonel?

1213
01:04:53,894 --> 01:04:56,497
Lieutenant, we discussed this.

1214
01:04:58,232 --> 01:05:02,136
You discussed this
with your team, not us.

1215
01:05:03,137 --> 01:05:05,939
I'm sorry, but I'm not
gonna watch my sisters die

1216
01:05:06,006 --> 01:05:07,975
in the sky of North Kiyung.

1217
01:05:09,243 --> 01:05:11,345
We are a demonstration team,
sir.

1218
01:05:14,114 --> 01:05:16,350
Not combat.

1219
01:05:16,417 --> 01:05:17,384
I'm sorry.

1220
01:05:29,764 --> 01:05:33,400
<i>Ballistic missiles</i>
<i>are being - coast</i>

1221
01:05:33,467 --> 01:05:36,236
<i>that spy satellites</i>
<i>had detected activity -</i>

1222
01:05:36,303 --> 01:05:37,906
What are you doing?

1223
01:05:37,971 --> 01:05:40,207
<i>...long-range</i>
<i>missile has recently...</i>

1224
01:05:40,274 --> 01:05:41,241
Packing.

1225
01:05:49,717 --> 01:05:51,218
You should, too.

1226
01:05:53,588 --> 01:05:56,223
They're just gonna
suspend us again.

1227
01:05:57,625 --> 01:06:01,395
- But I'm not gonna wait.
- So that's it?

1228
01:06:01,462 --> 01:06:02,963
You're just gonna
pack up and leave

1229
01:06:03,030 --> 01:06:04,198
as soon as your country
needs you?

1230
01:06:07,669 --> 01:06:12,473
My husband died flying my wing
over North Kiyung 15 years ago.

1231
01:06:12,540 --> 01:06:16,376
I watched him get blown
to pieces before my eyes.

1232
01:06:16,443 --> 01:06:21,048
If anyone understands
your fear, I do.

1233
01:06:22,517 --> 01:06:25,520
But if I had to go again,
I would.

1234
01:06:25,587 --> 01:06:28,288
And he would want me
to protect my country.

1235
01:06:29,791 --> 01:06:34,161
Think about what your father
would do and what he would want.

1236
01:06:35,830 --> 01:06:38,332
And that's where you'll find
the right answer.

1237
01:06:41,569 --> 01:06:43,070
<i>We have some very unfortunate</i>

1238
01:06:43,136 --> 01:06:44,806
breaking news out of Washington.

1239
01:06:44,873 --> 01:06:46,574
It's coming in right now.

1240
01:06:46,641 --> 01:06:48,877
Olson Walter,
the 22-year-old student

1241
01:06:48,943 --> 01:06:52,479
that was previously
imprisoned in North Kiyung,

1242
01:06:52,547 --> 01:06:54,516
has died at his home
this evening

1243
01:06:54,582 --> 01:06:56,718
from the brutal injuries
that he sustained

1244
01:06:56,784 --> 01:06:58,586
while being imprisoned.

1245
01:06:58,653 --> 01:07:02,089
North Kiyung leader Kin Huan
has released a statement.

1246
01:07:02,155 --> 01:07:04,726
He promised
every American citizen

1247
01:07:04,792 --> 01:07:06,861
will scream in terror

1248
01:07:06,928 --> 01:07:09,864
<i>now that he has an ICBM</i>

1249
01:07:09,931 --> 01:07:12,700
<i>capable of reaching Los Angeles,</i>

1250
01:07:12,767 --> 01:07:16,771
and possibly even Washington
and New York.

1251
01:07:16,838 --> 01:07:18,405
I'm Brooke McKinley.

1252
01:07:18,472 --> 01:07:20,508
Please stay with us.
We'll be right back.

1253
01:07:24,378 --> 01:07:26,848
<i>All right. Joe Wilson,</i>
<i>live from the Pentagon.</i>

1254
01:07:26,915 --> 01:07:29,216
<i>It's always a pleasure</i>
<i>to talk to you. Thank you.</i>

1255
01:07:29,283 --> 01:07:31,886
<i>All right. Tensions are still</i>
<i>heating up across the West</i>

1256
01:07:31,953 --> 01:07:34,421
<i>as we have just learned</i>
<i>that North Kiyung</i>

1257
01:07:34,488 --> 01:07:36,524
<i>launched yet</i>
<i>another test missile.</i>

1258
01:07:36,591 --> 01:07:39,694
<i>That's seven missiles total</i>
<i>in the last three weeks.</i>

1259
01:07:39,761 --> 01:07:42,396
<i>The Department of Defense</i>
<i>will be joining us shortly</i>

1260
01:07:42,462 --> 01:07:44,632
<i>and briefing us</i>
<i>with the latest developments...</i>

1261
01:07:44,699 --> 01:07:47,267
Look, if you give me
just a couple hours,

1262
01:07:47,334 --> 01:07:49,269
I'm sure I will come up
with something where I can--

1263
01:07:49,336 --> 01:07:51,071
Well, I suggest
you think of something

1264
01:07:51,138 --> 01:07:52,139
because in approximately
60 hours, we're--

1265
01:07:52,205 --> 01:07:54,141
I will protect it.

1266
01:07:57,912 --> 01:07:59,781
I'm sorry?

1267
01:07:59,847 --> 01:08:02,951
It's one thing
to serve your country.

1268
01:08:03,017 --> 01:08:06,253
But when it comes down to it,
will you protect it?

1269
01:08:07,956 --> 01:08:09,389
I will.

1270
01:08:09,456 --> 01:08:12,125
And I'd like the details
of the operation, sir.

1271
01:08:18,833 --> 01:08:20,267
Oh, Colonel.

1272
01:08:20,334 --> 01:08:22,670
Hey, um, I'll catch you
in a minute, okay?

1273
01:08:22,737 --> 01:08:24,171
Okay. Uh-hmm.

1274
01:08:28,743 --> 01:08:30,979
Shouldn't you be
in final briefing?

1275
01:08:31,045 --> 01:08:33,113
Can I speak freely with you,
Colonel?

1276
01:08:33,180 --> 01:08:38,251
You know, just Kaden to Julian.

1277
01:08:38,318 --> 01:08:40,655
Sure. What's up?

1278
01:08:40,722 --> 01:08:41,756
Um...

1279
01:08:43,024 --> 01:08:45,693
I just--

1280
01:08:45,760 --> 01:08:47,061
I really wanna make sure

1281
01:08:47,127 --> 01:08:50,197
that there's no more
hidden agenda.

1282
01:08:50,263 --> 01:08:52,867
I mean, my team doesn't fire
a single shot.

1283
01:08:53,935 --> 01:08:56,436
We cross the border,
distract them a little bit,

1284
01:08:56,503 --> 01:09:01,776
and Squadron-2 comes in
and does all the dirty work.

1285
01:09:01,843 --> 01:09:05,713
We all head home together.

1286
01:09:09,182 --> 01:09:10,417
That's it.

1287
01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:14,354
Can that be a promise?

1288
01:09:16,423 --> 01:09:17,659
Lieutenant...

1289
01:09:19,226 --> 01:09:21,663
you're going into a battle zone.

1290
01:09:21,729 --> 01:09:24,932
-I mean--
-I need that promise.

1291
01:09:32,239 --> 01:09:33,941
Sure.

1292
01:09:34,008 --> 01:09:38,946
I promise.

1293
01:09:39,013 --> 01:09:41,281
Okay. Thank you.

1294
01:09:57,699 --> 01:10:00,902
Please forgive me
for what I'm about to do.

1295
01:10:03,938 --> 01:10:05,472
Watch over me.

1296
01:10:12,279 --> 01:10:14,115
And be my wings.

1297
01:10:39,339 --> 01:10:40,908
<i>We're gonna hit them</i>
<i>at sunrise.</i>

1298
01:10:42,577 --> 01:10:44,444
<i>The nuclear facility</i>
<i>is buried 60 miles</i>

1299
01:10:44,512 --> 01:10:46,614
<i>in the mountains of Baganiya.</i>

1300
01:10:46,681 --> 01:10:48,716
<i>In order to get</i>
<i>to this facility,</i>

1301
01:10:48,783 --> 01:10:51,119
<i>unfortunately,</i>
<i>you'll need to get past</i>

1302
01:10:51,185 --> 01:10:52,720
<i>their coastal defenses.</i>

1303
01:10:52,787 --> 01:10:55,489
<i>Wing Girls will be leading</i>
<i>this operation</i>

1304
01:10:55,556 --> 01:10:57,424
<i>as a distraction team.</i>

1305
01:10:57,491 --> 01:11:00,427
<i>You will be referred to</i>
<i>as the Iron Angels.</i>

1306
01:11:00,494 --> 01:11:03,197
<i>Stay below 5,000 feet.</i>

1307
01:11:03,263 --> 01:11:04,699
<i>Get as close to the coastal line</i>

1308
01:11:04,766 --> 01:11:07,034
<i>without being picked up</i>
<i>on radar.</i>

1309
01:11:07,101 --> 01:11:08,903
<i>Once you break</i>
<i>the 200-mile mark,</i>

1310
01:11:08,970 --> 01:11:11,839
<i>it's gonna become a very</i>
<i>uncomfortable situation</i>

1311
01:11:11,906 --> 01:11:13,608
<i>very quickly.</i>

1312
01:11:13,674 --> 01:11:16,244
<i>They're going to throw</i>
<i>everything they have at you.</i>

1313
01:11:16,309 --> 01:11:17,845
<i>Just do what you do best.</i>

1314
01:11:17,912 --> 01:11:21,115
<i>Give them an air show</i>
<i>they've never seen before.</i>

1315
01:11:21,182 --> 01:11:22,650
<i>Squadron-2 will punch through</i>

1316
01:11:22,717 --> 01:11:25,553
<i>and take out</i>
<i>the nuclear facility.</i>

1317
01:11:25,620 --> 01:11:28,355
<i>Once Squadron-2</i>
<i>takes out the facility,</i>

1318
01:11:28,421 --> 01:11:31,391
<i>you can pull back to the Sea</i>
<i>of Jafnia, your safe zone.</i>

1319
01:11:33,094 --> 01:11:36,329
<i>You'll be in and out 20 minutes.</i>

1320
01:11:36,396 --> 01:11:37,932
<i>Make us proud.</i>

1321
01:11:41,468 --> 01:11:43,805
That's why
they call them clowns.

1322
01:11:45,573 --> 01:11:48,176
Hey, Bells,
What the hell happened?

1323
01:11:48,242 --> 01:11:49,877
Well, Washington gave it
the green light.

1324
01:11:49,944 --> 01:11:51,045
First wave just left.

1325
01:11:51,112 --> 01:11:52,647
Green light?

1326
01:11:52,713 --> 01:11:53,881
Uh-hmm.

1327
01:11:55,817 --> 01:11:58,920
Tell me Country and her team
are not on that first wave.

1328
01:12:00,788 --> 01:12:02,190
What, you want me to lie to you?

1329
01:12:02,256 --> 01:12:03,825
Give me airborne now.

1330
01:12:03,891 --> 01:12:05,492
Negative. Colonel's got you
on alert, Bells.

1331
01:12:05,560 --> 01:12:06,894
I said now.

1332
01:12:12,200 --> 01:12:13,500
Attention, aircraft,

1333
01:12:13,568 --> 01:12:14,869
this is Falcon Riebach
from the Wing Girls.

1334
01:12:14,936 --> 01:12:16,838
You are flying
in restricted airspace,

1335
01:12:16,904 --> 01:12:19,941
please identify yourself
or I will take you down.

1336
01:12:20,007 --> 01:12:21,408
You're a girl?

1337
01:12:21,474 --> 01:12:24,846
Ha-ha-ha, no way, American scum.
Bring it on.

1338
01:12:26,379 --> 01:12:31,451
Almost got him
and FOX 2.

1339
01:12:32,620 --> 01:12:34,387
Thanks a lot. He got away.

1340
01:12:34,454 --> 01:12:37,124
Tss. Nah, he just got scared.

1341
01:12:37,191 --> 01:12:39,392
Didn't have to shoot them.

1342
01:12:39,459 --> 01:12:40,561
And you still saved the world.

1343
01:12:40,628 --> 01:12:41,963
I'm Lieutenant Claymont.

1344
01:12:42,029 --> 01:12:44,098
I fly with your mother.

1345
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:48,903
Thanks for your service.

1346
01:12:48,970 --> 01:12:50,338
Well, you are definitely
Country's daughter,

1347
01:12:50,403 --> 01:12:51,639
that's for sure.

1348
01:12:56,077 --> 01:12:57,879
And I would be her father.

1349
01:12:57,945 --> 01:12:59,113
Hey, Dad.

1350
01:13:01,549 --> 01:13:03,951
What? No salute for me?

1351
01:13:05,786 --> 01:13:06,687
Uh...

1352
01:13:07,722 --> 01:13:09,624
Lighten up.
I'm just messing with you.

1353
01:13:11,225 --> 01:13:12,827
How can I help you?

1354
01:13:12,894 --> 01:13:14,595
Yeah. First of all, I'm sorry.

1355
01:13:14,662 --> 01:13:17,331
I guess I--I guess
I should have knocked first.

1356
01:13:17,397 --> 01:13:19,432
I actually have
a special package

1357
01:13:19,499 --> 01:13:21,401
from Ms. Riebach
for her daughter.

1358
01:13:21,468 --> 01:13:24,639
It's a letter and she wanted
to make sure it got to her

1359
01:13:24,705 --> 01:13:26,974
as soon as she was airborne.

1360
01:13:27,041 --> 01:13:29,076
May I?

1361
01:13:29,143 --> 01:13:31,545
Yeah, sure. Go right ahead.

1362
01:13:31,612 --> 01:13:32,947
Can I open it now?

1363
01:13:33,014 --> 01:13:35,182
Whenever you'd like.

1364
01:13:35,249 --> 01:13:36,416
Why don't you go take it

1365
01:13:36,483 --> 01:13:37,752
and read it on the bench,
sweetie?

1366
01:13:46,961 --> 01:13:48,729
"If I know my little Falcon,

1370
01:13:53,433 --> 01:13:55,336
You're always training

1372

And one day, you will.

1373
01:13:57,838 --> 01:13:59,006
I just wanna let you know
that mommy and daddy

1374
01:13:59,073 --> 01:14:01,375
will support you

1391
01:14:50,024 --> 01:14:52,994
Yeah. I'm ready, Captain.

1392
01:14:53,060 --> 01:14:54,428
Any pilot that can sleep

1393
01:14:54,494 --> 01:14:56,330
before a preemptive strike,

1394
01:14:56,397 --> 01:14:58,399
better pilot than me, man.

1395
01:14:58,466 --> 01:14:59,834
Huh? Huh?

1396
01:14:59,900 --> 01:15:01,635
Sorry, sorry, I was sleeping.

1397
01:15:01,702 --> 01:15:04,271
Did you say something
about a preemptive strike?

1398
01:15:04,338 --> 01:15:07,508
<i>Oh, splash one by Baby.</i>

1399
01:15:07,575 --> 01:15:09,310
<i>Yeah. Okay, Baby,</i>

1400
01:15:09,377 --> 01:15:10,911
<i>did you bring</i>
<i>an extra diaper with you?</i>

1401
01:15:10,978 --> 01:15:12,380
<i>You're gonna need it.</i>

1402
01:15:12,446 --> 01:15:14,415
<i>Only</i>
<i>if you're changing it.</i>

1403
01:15:23,791 --> 01:15:26,494
<i>I wanna be a Navy pilot.</i>

1404
01:15:30,798 --> 01:15:31,966
<i>How about you, Country?</i>

1405
01:15:32,033 --> 01:15:34,502
How your you girls
doing up there?

1406
01:15:34,568 --> 01:15:36,470
<i>I'm okay.</i>

1407
01:15:36,537 --> 01:15:38,205
<i>A little nervous.</i>

1408
01:15:38,272 --> 01:15:42,777
Just enjoying the sounds
of the Indian night-noises.

1409
01:15:42,843 --> 01:15:44,645
<i>You're gonna be just fine.</i>

1410
01:15:46,113 --> 01:15:48,015
<i>Got any preflight jokes</i>

1411
01:15:48,082 --> 01:15:50,251
<i>to bring break the tension</i>
<i>up here, girls?</i>

1412
01:15:50,317 --> 01:15:52,086
<i>Negative.</i>

1413
01:15:52,153 --> 01:15:56,090
<i>I honestly can't think</i>
<i>of anything right now.</i>

1414
01:15:57,391 --> 01:16:00,227
<i>I just wanna say whatever</i>
<i>happens up here today,</i>

1415
01:16:00,294 --> 01:16:02,463
<i>it's been a pleasure</i>
<i>to serve with you, ladies.</i>

1416
01:16:02,531 --> 01:16:04,065
<i>I mean it.</i>

1417
01:16:04,131 --> 01:16:06,500
<i>Thank you, Baby.</i>
<i>We appreciate that.</i>

1418
01:16:06,567 --> 01:16:08,803
<i>Oh, come on,</i>
<i>serve with them?</i>

1419
01:16:08,869 --> 01:16:10,137
<i>Met them like three weeks ago.</i>

1420
01:16:10,204 --> 01:16:11,872
<i>I'm the one who served</i>
<i>with them.</i>

1421
01:16:11,939 --> 01:16:14,775
<i>Not the time</i>
<i>for pickup lines, Baby.</i>

1422
01:16:14,842 --> 01:16:17,111
<i>That Mr. Ego</i>
<i>getting overprotective</i>

1423
01:16:17,178 --> 01:16:19,346
<i>of the sour candy you wanted?</i>

1424
01:16:19,413 --> 01:16:23,751
<i>You got something</i>
<i>to tell us, Ego?</i>

1425
01:16:24,752 --> 01:16:26,787
<i>Jealousy is the pain</i>
<i>a man feels</i>

1426
01:16:26,854 --> 01:16:28,289
<i>when he is not equally beloved</i>

1427
01:16:28,355 --> 01:16:31,058
<i>by the person</i>
<i>whom he entirely loves.</i>

1428
01:16:31,125 --> 01:16:34,128
<i>Yeah. Perhaps you'd like</i>
<i>to give the prestrike toast</i>

1429
01:16:34,195 --> 01:16:36,063
<i>and share some words</i>
<i>of encouragement.</i>

1430
01:16:36,130 --> 01:16:37,198
<i>Stage is yours.</i>

1431
01:16:45,039 --> 01:16:47,808
<i>Okay. Awkward.</i>

1432
01:16:47,875 --> 01:16:50,545
<i>Okay. Okay.</i>

1433
01:16:50,611 --> 01:16:54,615
<i>All I have to say</i>
<i>is I don't know how the hell</i>

1434
01:16:54,682 --> 01:16:58,219
<i>I got stuck saving the world</i>
<i>with a bunch of women.</i>

1435
01:16:58,285 --> 01:16:59,453
<i>Come on, man.</i>

1436
01:16:59,521 --> 01:17:02,756
<i>- But--</i>
<i>- And here we go.</i>

1437
01:17:02,823 --> 01:17:06,894
<i>But at least</i>
<i>when all hell breaks loose</i>

1438
01:17:06,961 --> 01:17:08,896
<i>and they fail on me,</i>

1439
01:17:08,963 --> 01:17:10,898
<i>I'll be okay,</i>

1440
01:17:10,965 --> 01:17:12,199
<i>because I'll still have Country</i>

1441
01:17:12,266 --> 01:17:13,968
<i>and the Wing Girls</i>
<i>to get me home.</i>

1442
01:17:15,636 --> 01:17:18,139
<i>Oh, okay, you got jokes.</i>

1443
01:17:18,205 --> 01:17:20,941
<i>And I'm honored</i>
<i>to fly with you.</i>

1444
01:17:21,008 --> 01:17:23,545
<i>All right, Angels,</i>
<i>you are weapons-free.</i>

1445
01:17:23,612 --> 01:17:24,678
<i>Godspeed, everyone.</i>

1446
01:17:24,745 --> 01:17:25,779
<i>It's happening.</i>

1447
01:17:25,846 --> 01:17:27,214
<i>All right. Here we go.</i>

1448
01:17:27,281 --> 01:17:29,383
<i>- Oh, shit.</i>
<i>- Okay.</i>

1449
01:17:29,450 --> 01:17:30,985
<i>Let's not fall apart now.</i>

1450
01:17:31,051 --> 01:17:32,987
<i>Remember the plan,</i>
<i>let's ring alarms,</i>

1451
01:17:33,053 --> 01:17:34,822
<i>let's do a couple tricks,</i>
<i>and get out of here.</i>

1452
01:17:34,889 --> 01:17:35,890
<i>Can we do that, team?</i>

1453
01:17:35,956 --> 01:17:36,891
<i>Let's do it.</i>

1454
01:17:36,957 --> 01:17:38,359
<i>God, I'm nervous.</i>

1455
01:17:38,425 --> 01:17:39,693
<i>Now is not the time</i>
<i>for nerves here.</i>

1456
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:41,162
<i>Time for piloting.</i>

1457
01:17:43,063 --> 01:17:44,398
<i>Wiki's, right.</i>

1458
01:17:44,465 --> 01:17:45,534
<i>This is the biggest air show</i>

1459
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:46,767
<i>in the world right now.</i>

1460
01:17:46,834 --> 01:17:48,002
That's why we're here.

1461
01:17:48,068 --> 01:17:50,104
<i>The audience, they're hostile,</i>

1462
01:17:50,171 --> 01:17:51,640
<i>and they do wanna shoot you down</i>

1463
01:17:51,705 --> 01:17:53,774
<i>to prevent you</i>
<i>from seeing your family again.</i>

1464
01:17:53,841 --> 01:17:55,409
<i>So instead of being nervous,</i>

1465
01:17:55,476 --> 01:17:58,779
<i>let's get angry</i>
<i>and make these bastards surface.</i>

1466
01:17:58,846 --> 01:18:00,549
<i>- Agreed?</i>
<i>- Agreed.</i>

1467
01:18:00,615 --> 01:18:03,017
<i>We fly in together,</i>
<i>we fly out together.</i>

1468
01:18:03,083 --> 01:18:04,451
<i>That's right.</i>

1469
01:18:04,519 --> 01:18:05,554
<i>Wing Girls for life?</i>

1470
01:18:05,620 --> 01:18:06,954
<i>Wing Girls for life.</i>

1471
01:18:07,021 --> 01:18:08,657
<i>Now let's go save the world.</i>

1472
01:18:16,697 --> 01:18:18,766
<i>I don't feel right</i>
<i>being back here, Mooney.</i>

1473
01:18:18,832 --> 01:18:20,868
<i>I should be up there with them.</i>

1474
01:18:20,935 --> 01:18:22,203
<i>Relax, Ego.</i>

1475
01:18:22,269 --> 01:18:23,871
<i>We're only a few minutes</i>
<i>behind them.</i>

1476
01:18:23,938 --> 01:18:25,439
<i>Focus on taking out</i>
<i>that nuclear plant.</i>

1477
01:18:25,507 --> 01:18:27,341
<i>Let the girls focus</i>
<i>on distracting them.</i>

1478
01:18:28,842 --> 01:18:30,612
<i>Hey, there's the shoreline.</i>

1479
01:18:30,679 --> 01:18:32,947
<i>Stay alert, eyes up, ladies.</i>

1480
01:18:34,281 --> 01:18:35,182
God help us.

1481
01:18:38,520 --> 01:18:40,187
<i>It's awfully quiet.</i>

1482
01:18:42,990 --> 01:18:44,458
<i>How about I knock on the door</i>

1483
01:18:44,526 --> 01:18:45,893
<i>with that old Maverick</i>
<i>and wake them him up?</i>

1484
01:18:50,030 --> 01:18:52,433
<i>Radar should</i>
<i>have detected us by now.</i>

1485
01:18:52,499 --> 01:18:53,767
<i>Strange.</i>

1486
01:19:05,879 --> 01:19:07,381
<i>I see something.</i>

1487
01:19:07,448 --> 01:19:09,917
<i>It does not appear</i>
<i>to be operational.</i>

1488
01:19:12,353 --> 01:19:14,088
<i>Welcome to North Kiyung.</i>

1489
01:19:14,154 --> 01:19:16,658
<i>Is any of this ancient</i>
<i>military shit operational?</i>

1490
01:19:16,725 --> 01:19:18,459
<i>This doesn't feel right.</i>
<i>Something's wrong.</i>

1491
01:19:23,864 --> 01:19:26,635
<i>Ever get the feeling like</i>
<i>you're being watched?</i>

1492
01:19:36,377 --> 01:19:37,978
<i>Looks like someone's awake.</i>

1493
01:19:38,812 --> 01:19:40,180
<i>What is it? What is it?</i>

1494
01:19:42,850 --> 01:19:44,586
<i>Anybody see it? Country?</i>

1495
01:19:44,653 --> 01:19:46,153
<i>- Negative, no joy.</i>
<i>- I got nothing.</i>

1496
01:19:51,792 --> 01:19:53,060
<i>It's gone.</i>

1497
01:19:56,230 --> 01:19:57,464
<i>Nothing here.</i>

1498
01:19:57,532 --> 01:19:59,300
<i>I think it</i>
<i>was a false alarm, guys.</i>

1499
01:19:59,366 --> 01:20:01,603
<i>Sky, - keep ringing detecting</i>
<i>any uglies in the area.</i>

1500
01:20:01,670 --> 01:20:04,071
<i>We picked up some</i>
<i>activity momentarily.</i>

1501
01:20:04,138 --> 01:20:07,408
<i>Be cautious.</i>

1502
01:20:07,474 --> 01:20:09,511
<i>It's an ambush.</i>
<i>Get them out of there, Colonel.</i>

1503
01:20:09,577 --> 01:20:11,713
<i>That signals them locking out</i>
<i>of on to their coordinates.</i>

1504
01:20:12,913 --> 01:20:15,684
<i>No wonder why</i>
<i>they do so many missile tests.</i>

1505
01:20:15,750 --> 01:20:18,986
<i>Shit don't work.</i>

1506
01:20:19,053 --> 01:20:21,989
<i>Yeah. I believe they said</i>
<i>we'll be flying in the most</i>

1507
01:20:22,056 --> 01:20:23,591
<i>dangerous skies in the world.</i>

1508
01:20:23,658 --> 01:20:25,225
<i>Angels, we are picking</i>
<i>up multiple missiles.</i>

1509
01:20:25,292 --> 01:20:26,026
<i>- Missile!</i>
<i>- I got incoming!</i>

1510
01:20:26,093 --> 01:20:27,629
<i>There!</i>

1511
01:20:27,696 --> 01:20:29,096
<i>- We got missiles!</i>
<i>- Guys, look out!</i>

1512
01:20:29,163 --> 01:20:29,863
<i>Flares out.</i>

1513
01:20:29,930 --> 01:20:29,963
<i>No.</i>

1514
01:20:31,031 --> 01:20:32,466
<i>Wiki!</i>

1515
01:20:35,169 --> 01:20:39,273
<i>Angel -</i>

1516
01:20:39,340 --> 01:20:41,842
<i>I've lost control</i>
<i>of the aircraft.</i>

1517
01:20:55,623 --> 01:20:58,425
<i>Wiki!</i>

1518
01:20:58,492 --> 01:21:02,096
<i>No one goes to AFLR unless</i>
<i>they're going into combat.</i>

1519
01:21:02,162 --> 01:21:04,264
<i>We aren't going anywhere.</i>

1520
01:21:11,372 --> 01:21:15,643
<i>Angels, you have</i>
<i>multiple bandits airborne.</i>

1521
01:21:16,644 --> 01:21:20,548
<i>Keep them away from the guys</i>
<i>or this mission is a failure.</i>

1522
01:21:25,854 --> 01:21:27,287
<i>Warning! Warning! Warning!</i>

1523
01:21:27,354 --> 01:21:31,425
<i>And eliminate</i>
<i>those missile sites now.</i>

1524
01:21:33,927 --> 01:21:36,430
<i>All right,</i>
<i>son of a bitch, let's go!</i>

1525
01:21:40,769 --> 01:21:42,136
<i>I got visual on the MiGS.</i>

1526
01:21:42,202 --> 01:21:43,904
<i>Distraction coming up.</i>

1527
01:21:45,973 --> 01:21:49,076
<i>Time to burn some gas</i>
<i>and kick some ass.</i>

1528
01:21:51,945 --> 01:21:55,082
<i>Angry birds, you need</i>
<i>to get to that objective.</i>

1529
01:21:55,149 --> 01:21:56,751
<i>The Angels</i>
<i>have been compromised.</i>

1530
01:21:56,818 --> 01:21:59,219
<i>They are holding those</i>
<i>MiGS off momentarily,</i>

1531
01:21:59,286 --> 01:22:01,589
<i>but it might not be for long.</i>

1532
01:22:01,656 --> 01:22:02,624
<i>Move it.</i>

1533
01:22:02,690 --> 01:22:03,792
<i>Sorry, fellas.</i>

1534
01:22:03,858 --> 01:22:05,292
<i>I'm going after the girls.</i>

1535
01:22:05,359 --> 01:22:07,261
<i>You heard the order, Ego.</i>

1536
01:22:07,327 --> 01:22:09,096
<i>We're going to the objective.</i>

1537
01:22:09,163 --> 01:22:11,031
<i>Can't do that, Cap.</i>

1538
01:22:11,098 --> 01:22:12,600
<i>Those are my girls.</i>

1539
01:22:12,667 --> 01:22:13,701
<i>Good luck.</i>

1540
01:22:15,804 --> 01:22:16,704
<i>Shit!</i>

1541
01:22:18,840 --> 01:22:22,276
<i>That's it, fellas,</i>
<i>let's bring it over here.</i>

1542
01:22:23,944 --> 01:22:25,279
<i>Now that we're face-to-face,</i>

1543
01:22:25,345 --> 01:22:27,114
<i>let's do this introduction</i>
<i>properly.</i>

1544
01:22:29,483 --> 01:22:31,185
<i>This one's for the girls.</i>

1545
01:22:36,056 --> 01:22:37,257
<i>On my way.</i>

1546
01:22:40,695 --> 01:22:41,995
<i>That's it.</i>

1547
01:22:43,263 --> 01:22:44,566
<i>Keep it coming, boys.</i>

1548
01:22:47,134 --> 01:22:48,670
<i>Ah, shit.</i>

1549
01:22:48,736 --> 01:22:51,238
<i>- A little help up here.</i>
<i>- I'll be right there.</i>

1550
01:22:52,540 --> 01:22:55,075
<i>Got three left on me</i>
<i>and one off windows.</i>

1551
01:22:56,678 --> 01:22:57,712
<i>I'm taking the shot.</i>

1552
01:23:00,782 --> 01:23:01,716
<i>Bandit down.</i>

1553
01:23:01,783 --> 01:23:03,250
<i>Riddle!</i>

1554
01:23:03,317 --> 01:23:06,053
<i>Mayday, Angel 3, I'm going down.</i>

1555
01:23:06,119 --> 01:23:07,988
<i>No, no, no.</i>
<i>Get down, Bear!</i>

1556
01:23:09,757 --> 01:23:10,991
<i>Motherfuck...</i>

1557
01:23:14,929 --> 01:23:17,498
<i>I need an update now,</i>
<i>Goddamn it.</i>

1558
01:23:21,836 --> 01:23:23,103
<i>Mayday, mayday.</i>

1559
01:23:23,170 --> 01:23:25,205
<i>This is Angel 2.</i>
<i>I took a direct hit.</i>

1560
01:23:25,272 --> 01:23:27,842
<i>All systems are - Fubar,</i>
<i>and I got a MiG</i>

1561
01:23:27,909 --> 01:23:29,944
<i>still on my 6:00.</i>

1562
01:23:30,010 --> 01:23:31,679
<i>I'm not gonna make it.</i>

1563
01:23:31,746 --> 01:23:33,180
<i>Yes, you are.</i>

1564
01:23:35,717 --> 01:23:37,117
<i>Jeeter.</i>

1565
01:23:38,920 --> 01:23:40,522
<i>I'm right behind you, Edge,</i>
<i>I'm blocking the shot.</i>

1566
01:23:40,588 --> 01:23:42,256
<i>You want got to eject.</i>
<i>Get out of there.</i>

1567
01:23:43,858 --> 01:23:45,994
<i>I think I can make it</i>
<i>back across the border,</i>

1568
01:23:46,059 --> 01:23:47,862
<i>just a little bit longer.</i>

1569
01:23:47,929 --> 01:23:49,029
<i>Just got locked.</i>

1570
01:23:49,096 --> 01:23:50,932
<i>He's locking me up, Edge.</i>

1571
01:23:50,999 --> 01:23:52,099
<i>Almost there, Jeeter.</i>

1572
01:23:52,165 --> 01:23:53,267
<i>Just a little bit longer.</i>

1573
01:23:53,333 --> 01:23:55,970
<i>Oh, shit. He's firing.</i>

1574
01:23:56,036 --> 01:23:57,404
- <i>Hit.</i>
<i>- Jeeter!</i>

1575
01:23:57,471 --> 01:23:58,773
<i>Warning. Warning.</i>
<i>Warning. Warning.</i>

1576
01:23:58,840 --> 01:23:59,908
<i>- Made it. Made it.</i>
<i>- Eject!</i>

1577
01:23:59,974 --> 01:24:01,341
<i>Edge, bad news.</i>

1578
01:24:01,408 --> 01:24:02,610
<i>- My hydraulics are down.</i>
<i>- FOX 2.</i>

1579
01:24:06,446 --> 01:24:08,215
<i>Clear, Jeeter.</i>
<i>Get the hell out of there.</i>

1580
01:24:08,282 --> 01:24:10,217
<i>Eject. Eject!</i>

1581
01:24:13,120 --> 01:24:16,925
<i>Edge, do you copy? Edge?</i>

1582
01:24:18,125 --> 01:24:20,795
<i>Skykeeper, we have friendlies</i>
<i>down in the hot zone.</i>

1583
01:24:20,862 --> 01:24:24,766
<i>I repeat, we have friendlies</i>
<i>down in the hot zone.</i>

1584
01:24:25,733 --> 01:24:27,769
<i>I'm currently</i>
<i>assessing the situation.</i>

1585
01:24:27,835 --> 01:24:29,637
<i>Standby for orders.</i>

1586
01:24:39,079 --> 01:24:40,748
<i>Country, I'm coming to you.</i>

1587
01:24:49,591 --> 01:24:52,159
<i>Listen,</i>
<i>I need you to get a grip.</i>

1588
01:24:52,225 --> 01:24:53,628
<i>We're in a lot of danger</i>
<i>right now.</i>

1589
01:24:53,695 --> 01:24:55,329
<i>I need you to stay on my wing</i>

1590
01:24:55,395 --> 01:24:57,297
<i>and I'm gonna stay on yours.</i>
<i>Okay?</i>

1591
01:24:58,365 --> 01:25:00,500
<i>We can talk about this</i>
<i>and grieve later.</i>

1592
01:25:03,403 --> 01:25:05,172
<i>Can we do that?</i>

1593
01:25:06,574 --> 01:25:07,609
<i>Yes?</i>

1594
01:25:15,016 --> 01:25:16,618
<i>Shit.</i>

1595
01:25:26,527 --> 01:25:29,631
<i>What the hell did that</i>
<i>bastard just say?</i>

1596
01:25:29,697 --> 01:25:31,699
<i>He said,</i>
<i>"Girls can't fly combat."</i>

1597
01:25:31,766 --> 01:25:32,834
<i>Believe that shit?</i>

1598
01:25:35,435 --> 01:25:37,204
<i>Attention, aircraft.</i>

1599
01:25:37,270 --> 01:25:40,608
<i>This is Lieutenant Riebach</i>
<i>from the United States Navy</i>

1600
01:25:40,675 --> 01:25:43,310
<i>and I am the last voice</i>
<i>you're gonna hear.</i>

1601
01:25:43,377 --> 01:25:45,680
<i>That's my girl.</i>

1602
01:25:45,747 --> 01:25:46,814
<i>Let's drop.</i>

1603
01:26:01,963 --> 01:26:03,296
<i>I got him.</i>

1604
01:26:06,701 --> 01:26:07,702
<i>Splat.</i>

1605
01:26:08,736 --> 01:26:10,203
<i>Nice shot.</i>

1606
01:26:11,806 --> 01:26:13,041
<i>Come on.</i>

1607
01:26:19,914 --> 01:26:21,314
<i>SAM incoming.</i>

1608
01:26:22,416 --> 01:26:23,685
<i>You handle the MiG.</i>

1609
01:26:23,751 --> 01:26:25,419
<i>I'll keep the missile busy.</i>

1610
01:26:25,485 --> 01:26:26,821
<i>Country, wait.</i>

1611
01:26:30,625 --> 01:26:31,626
<i>Shit.</i>

1612
01:26:37,330 --> 01:26:38,766
<i>I got you.</i>

1613
01:26:43,071 --> 01:26:44,672
<i>FOX 2.</i>

1614
01:26:48,241 --> 01:26:49,610
<i>Bogie down.</i>

1615
01:26:52,180 --> 01:26:53,447
<i>Country?</i>

1616
01:26:55,315 --> 01:26:56,918
<i>Country!</i>

1617
01:26:59,453 --> 01:27:01,723
<i>Today is not only</i>
<i>an anxiously proud day</i>

1618
01:27:01,789 --> 01:27:04,726
<i>for the American people</i>
<i>as the airstrikes against</i>

1619
01:27:04,792 --> 01:27:08,529
<i>North Kiyung's nuclear</i>
<i>facilities were successful.</i>

1620
01:27:08,596 --> 01:27:11,331
<i>But it is a somber one as well.</i>

1621
01:27:11,398 --> 01:27:13,400
<i>Seven of our brave men and women</i>

1622
01:27:13,467 --> 01:27:15,069
<i>who selflessly sacrifice</i>

1623
01:27:15,136 --> 01:27:17,872
<i>and devote their lives</i>
<i>to keeping us all safe</i>

1624
01:27:17,939 --> 01:27:21,142
<i>are reportedly missing</i>
<i>behind enemy lines.</i>

1625
01:27:21,209 --> 01:27:24,979
<i>We lower our flag</i>
<i>in the hopes that they are alive</i>

1626
01:27:25,046 --> 01:27:28,315
<i>and with the intention</i>
<i>of bringing them home safely.</i>

1627
01:27:28,381 --> 01:27:30,118
<i>I'm Julia Dalton.</i>

1628
01:27:30,184 --> 01:27:31,786
<i>Stay tuned.</i>

1629
01:28:41,122 --> 01:28:45,560
<i>We all head home together.</i>

1630
01:28:45,626 --> 01:28:46,861
<i>I promise.</i>

1631
01:28:50,463 --> 01:28:52,432
<i>Okay, thank you.</i>

1632
01:30:03,137 --> 01:30:05,273
Oh, hey mom.
There you are.

1633
01:30:05,339 --> 01:30:10,378
The commander called and said
something about they found Edge.

1634
01:30:10,443 --> 01:30:11,712
Yes.

1635
01:30:11,779 --> 01:30:13,581
The doctor will be with you
shortly.

1636
01:30:13,648 --> 01:30:15,149
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1637
01:30:20,354 --> 01:30:21,589
- Is she okay?
- Calm down.

1638
01:30:21,656 --> 01:30:23,824
Please tell me she's okay.

1639
01:30:23,891 --> 01:30:25,393
She's home.

1640
01:30:25,458 --> 01:30:27,695
That's what's important.

1641
01:30:29,196 --> 01:30:33,167
But she, um, she's, um,

1642
01:30:35,336 --> 01:30:37,470
she's in a coma, Kaden.

1643
01:30:38,471 --> 01:30:39,840
Oh.

1644
01:30:42,043 --> 01:30:43,177
Huh.

1645
01:31:18,478 --> 01:31:22,216
Margo, can you hear me?

1646
01:31:22,283 --> 01:31:23,951
This is your father.

1647
01:31:26,187 --> 01:31:28,522
I know I haven't been the best
dad in the world to you,

1648
01:31:28,589 --> 01:31:30,691
but I promise I'm gonna
make it up to you.

1649
01:31:33,661 --> 01:31:35,329
You really need to know
that I care for you

1650
01:31:35,396 --> 01:31:37,732
and I love you very, very much.

1651
01:31:39,800 --> 01:31:41,936
You're a strong woman.

1652
01:31:44,438 --> 01:31:46,640
I know you're gonna
get out of this.

1653
01:32:04,258 --> 01:32:05,526
Country.

1654
01:32:24,011 --> 01:32:26,914
<i>My job as a pilot</i>
<i>for the United States Navy</i>

1655
01:32:26,981 --> 01:32:30,684
<i>and a member of this team</i>
<i>is to protect us.</i>

1656
01:32:30,751 --> 01:32:35,589
<i>And I will,</i>
<i>even if it means dying.</i>

1657
01:32:40,861 --> 01:32:43,097
Can I offer
you guys something to drink?

1658
01:32:44,598 --> 01:32:45,900
Some coffee?

1659
01:32:46,767 --> 01:32:48,269
Maybe some scotch?

1660
01:32:49,503 --> 01:32:50,805
I'm fine.

1661
01:32:50,871 --> 01:32:53,074
We're fine. Thank you.

1662
01:32:55,876 --> 01:32:58,345
I spoke with
Commander Mosko today.

1663
01:33:00,014 --> 01:33:03,984
She said Edge really
hadn't improved too much.

1664
01:33:05,753 --> 01:33:07,321
How you doing? Are you okay?

1665
01:33:11,058 --> 01:33:13,160
How do you think I'm doing,
Colonel?

1666
01:33:15,996 --> 01:33:19,100
Look, Kaden...I know.

1667
01:33:19,166 --> 01:33:21,235
- I know that--
- You promised me.

1668
01:33:24,505 --> 01:33:26,173
There was no way...

1669
01:33:27,741 --> 01:33:31,378
I could have predicted what
was going to happen up there.

1670
01:33:31,445 --> 01:33:32,813
No one could have.

1671
01:33:34,882 --> 01:33:36,884
I have reason to believe

1672
01:33:37,852 --> 01:33:40,121
that a lot of them
are still alive.

1673
01:33:44,625 --> 01:33:45,960
What?

1674
01:33:47,596 --> 01:33:48,996
This conversation,

1675
01:33:49,997 --> 01:33:51,699
it stays right here.

1676
01:33:51,765 --> 01:33:53,200
- Yes.
- Captain?

1677
01:33:53,267 --> 01:33:55,169
Of course, sir.

1678
01:33:56,337 --> 01:33:58,906
The UN uses a channel

1679
01:33:58,973 --> 01:34:01,008
what's known as
the New York Channel,

1680
01:34:01,075 --> 01:34:03,644
which has been an avenue
of communication

1681
01:34:03,711 --> 01:34:07,081
between the US and North Kiyung.

1682
01:34:07,148 --> 01:34:09,917
Well, a few days ago,
they made a statement

1683
01:34:09,984 --> 01:34:12,486
regarding American prisoners.

1684
01:34:12,554 --> 01:34:14,788
Pilots, specifically.

1685
01:34:17,158 --> 01:34:18,359
They're alive.

1686
01:34:20,661 --> 01:34:22,863
How do we know
they're not bluffing?

1687
01:34:22,930 --> 01:34:24,698
Couldn't they just be
saying this to gain

1688
01:34:24,765 --> 01:34:26,267
some sort of leverage?

1689
01:34:27,801 --> 01:34:30,437
Because they said...

1690
01:34:31,772 --> 01:34:35,743
the prison camps have never
smelled so beautiful before.

1691
01:34:41,616 --> 01:34:42,983
My girls...

1692
01:34:45,554 --> 01:34:48,289
and that son of a bitch.

1693
01:34:54,295 --> 01:34:55,329
What's the plan?

1694
01:34:56,197 --> 01:34:57,965
We can't just let them sit there

1695
01:34:58,032 --> 01:35:00,868
and...you know what they do

1696
01:35:00,935 --> 01:35:02,671
to Americans in those camps.

1697
01:35:02,736 --> 01:35:05,806
Well, unfortunately,
there is no plan.

1698
01:35:05,873 --> 01:35:07,174
Not right now, anyways.

1699
01:35:09,310 --> 01:35:14,081
We are trying to dissect exactly
what they meant by that comment.

1700
01:35:15,816 --> 01:35:17,686
But unfortunately,
the lines went dead

1701
01:35:17,751 --> 01:35:19,386
within the last few days.

1702
01:35:21,355 --> 01:35:23,857
And after everything
that's happened,

1703
01:35:26,360 --> 01:35:27,828
I can assure you...

1704
01:35:28,929 --> 01:35:30,965
it's gonna take an act of God

1705
01:35:31,031 --> 01:35:32,733
to go back in there again.

1706
01:35:35,469 --> 01:35:37,204
It just so happens...

1707
01:35:41,909 --> 01:35:44,378
that I am very close with God.

1708
01:35:53,555 --> 01:35:55,557
I'm getting them back.
