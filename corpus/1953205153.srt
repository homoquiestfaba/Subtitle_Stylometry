-Hear you only when you say ''I can''.

3
00:01:55,434 --> 00:01:57,664
-Mom.
-First thing is position.

4
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:01,533

-Go on. To the right.

Okay. Good day at school.

Evangelista Torricelli.

80
00:09:52,444 --> 00:09:55,504
And who was the first prime
minister of independent India?

81
00:09:55,714 --> 00:09:57,011
Jawaharlal Nehru.

82
00:09:57,215 --> 00:10:00,582
That 's my girl.
Okay, good day.

83
00:10:01,753 --> 00:10:05,211
You see that? She doesn't
even need to go to school.

84
00:10:05,457 --> 00:10:06,549
It 's that Book of Answers.

85
00:10:06,758 --> 00:10:09,556
I knew it,
I knew she would love that.

-And I love you.
-No, I love you.

87
00:10:16,801 --> 00:10:19,861
No, no, no.

-Two hands on the wheel.
-I wanna stop.

92
00:10:53,204 --> 00:10:54,967
But we haven't gone on our voyage.

93
00:10:55,173 --> 00:10:57,505
-What voyage?
-Please concentrate.

94
00:10:57,709 --> 00:11:01,372
Think about your hands

95
00:11:01,813 --> 00:11:04,008
Okay?

96
00:11:04,215 --> 00:11:05,614
Yeah.

97
00:11:05,817 --> 00:11:09,309
-Yes.
-Yes.

98
00:11:09,854 --> 00:11:11,651
Now what do I do
when I'm going to turn?

99
00:11:12,357 --> 00:11:17,021
-You always drive with one hand.
-I can't get anything past to you!

100
00:11:17,228 --> 00:11:19,423
Miss Silken says I'm observant.

101
00:11:19,864 --> 00:11:22,662
Miss Silken talks a lot.

102
00:11:22,867 --> 00:11:27,099
I can't believe I let you get
this far without a seatbelt.

103
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:34,269
-Good. Now, left-hand turn.
-What do I do?

104
00:11:34,712 --> 00:11:37,681
Hit the turn signal and
turn the steering wheel to the left.

105
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:41,714
-I'm turning.
-See? I promised you...

106
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:46,220

107
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:48,426
Promise.

108
00:11:48,626 --> 00:11:50,253

Oh, sweet thing,
you're very welcome.

110
00:11:53,131 --> 00:11:54,689

I always liked the way
a scraped knee looks on a girl.

114
00:12:07,378 --> 00:12:11,747
Makes you look kind of tough
and vulnerable at the same time.

115
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:15,784
Come on, Emily, you slow poke!

116
00:12:17,689 --> 00:12:20,055

118
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:25,593
Don't let any boys give you
any trouble, okay?

119
00:12:25,797 --> 00:12:28,493
All you have to remember
is that deep down inside...

120
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:31,396
they're all afraid of girls.

121

129
00:13:28,126 --> 00:13:32,062
Well, let me just say that I don't

130
00:13:32,263 --> 00:13:35,232
liaison, but there was a strong
symbiosis between us...

00:17:56,828 --> 00:18:00,457
And he is wondering
what disaster she abandoned...

173
00:18:00,665 --> 00:18:03,566
knowing full well
she will never answer him.

174
00:18:09,373 --> 00:18:12,274
I struck you as sad?

175
00:18:13,978 --> 00:18:18,142
No, you struck me as eccentric.
You were on the floor.

176
00:18:18,816 --> 00:18:20,784
Right.

177
00:18:22,353 --> 00:18:26,915
-In the elevator.
-And then you struck me as stunning.

178
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:39,395
And now you just strike me.

179
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:47,474
Did an invisible hand
push you into this room?

180
00:18:51,582 --> 00:18:55,245
I think so. I do.

181
00:18:56,487 --> 00:18:59,820
Will everything work out?

182
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:07,961
I believe so. I really do.

183
00:19:08,165 --> 00:19:10,565
Show me.

184
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:51,540
You must please know that you are
the one true love of my life.

185
00:20:00,284 --> 00:20:03,651
<i>His name was Paul</i>.

186
00:20:10,094 --> 00:20:13,621
<i>And then, you were growing</i>
<i>inside of me</i>.

187
00:20:14,498 --> 00:20:16,796
<i>A child of passion</i>...

188
00:20:17,001 --> 00:20:19,162
<i>when I had least expected it</i>.

189
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:20,769
It 's really a lovely place.

190
00:20:20,972 --> 00:20:24,464
And, of course, there are tons
of kids in the neighborhood.

191
00:20:28,546 --> 00:20:32,949
Are you all right? She's gonna
have a little baby, Mikey.

192
00:20:37,254 --> 00:20:39,779
I'll buy it.

193
00:20:40,725 --> 00:20:44,058
That 's terrific.
I can recommend several...

194
00:20:44,261 --> 00:20:47,628
...excellent mortgage...
-Cash.

195
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,027
Cash? Did you hear that? Cash!

196
00:20:58,909 --> 00:21:04,848
<i>There is no falling in love like</i>
<i>the falling in love with a child</i>.

197
00:21:27,671 --> 00:21:31,300
<i>I never wanted an easy child</i>.

198
00:21:36,047 --> 00:21:39,210
Nightshirts. Clothesline.

199
00:21:39,417 --> 00:21:42,580
<i>I wanted an exceptional one</i>.

200
00:21:42,787 --> 00:21:47,588
Birdbath. See the birdbath?

201
00:21:50,127 --> 00:21:53,187
Azaleas.

202
00:21:53,431 --> 00:21:57,060
Mackerel skies and octopi eyes.

203
00:21:57,268 --> 00:22:02,137
<i>We were gods then, together</i>,
<i>those afternoons</i>.

204
00:22:04,742 --> 00:22:07,142
-Lemon?
-No, thank you.

205
00:22:07,344 --> 00:22:12,304
-He's such a perfect little boy.
-''Such a perfect little boy''.

206
00:22:12,516 --> 00:22:16,247
The place looks great.
The garden is stupendous.

207
00:22:16,454 --> 00:22:21,187
Thanks. It was easy, really.
The previous owners were a...

208
00:22:21,392 --> 00:22:23,485
You're home all the time.
That helps.

209
00:22:23,761 --> 00:22:26,127
Just you and little Paulie here.

210
00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:30,391
-Sugar?
-No. Thank you. Sweet 'N Low.

211
00:22:33,704 --> 00:22:37,504
He is really so easy.
So how do you like the house?

212
00:22:37,708 --> 00:22:38,834
It 's wonderful.

213
00:22:39,043 --> 00:22:41,603
I knew you'd love it. Of course
it 's not right for everyone.

214
00:22:41,812 --> 00:22:44,406
But clearly, you are so creative.

215
00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:51,883
Gotta teach me your trick.
Sounds like he's out already.

216
00:22:52,089 --> 00:22:54,853
He takes so easily to people.

217
00:23:11,275 --> 00:23:16,178
The terrible lady.
Let 's clean you all up.

218
00:23:17,281 --> 00:23:20,216
I'm sorry.

219
00:23:21,418 --> 00:23:25,377
What 's that? Is that a tooth?

220
00:23:25,589 --> 00:23:30,617
No! It 's not time for that yet.
No, sweetie.

221
00:23:30,828 --> 00:23:33,228
Not time for that.

222
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:40,964
-I wanna go inside.
-Well, we haven't gotten there yet.

223
00:23:41,205 --> 00:23:43,366
We have to pass the eighteen story...

224
00:23:43,574 --> 00:23:47,237
candy store and the rainbow-colored...

225
00:23:47,444 --> 00:23:49,344
I'm tired.

226
00:23:49,547 --> 00:23:51,174
Come on, Loverboy, please?

227
00:23:51,382 --> 00:23:54,545
Don't call me Loverboy.
I'm Paul.

228
00:23:59,123 --> 00:24:00,920
-Stop that.
-It hurts.

229
00:24:01,225 --> 00:24:03,022
-Guess what.
-No.

230
00:24:09,166 --> 00:24:12,363
-Why'd you do that?
-Cause we're sleeping here tonight.

231
00:24:12,937 --> 00:24:15,770
I got everything ready.

232
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:19,104
All your favorites.

233
00:24:21,579 --> 00:24:24,139
Pick a hand.

234
00:24:28,352 --> 00:24:32,880
Come on. Pick a hand.

235
00:24:33,824 --> 00:24:36,384
Pick a hand, any hand.

236
00:24:36,594 --> 00:24:39,620
Go ahead, honey.
Make Daddy happy.

237
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:42,264
-Come on, baby girl.
-I'm ten.

238
00:24:42,967 --> 00:24:46,664
Just an expression of endearment.
Daddy calls me ''baby doll''.

239
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:48,235
Clearly I am not a baby.

240
00:24:48,439 --> 00:24:51,306
No darling, you definitely are not.

241
00:24:52,576 --> 00:24:54,635
Left.

242
00:24:54,845 --> 00:24:57,643
Yeah, look at that. She got it.
She got it right.

243
00:24:57,848 --> 00:25:01,750
Honey, you're gonna love it so much.
We picked it out together.

244
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:04,011
-It 's nice.
-There's more.

245
00:25:04,221 --> 00:25:07,657
-Marty, show her.
-Just, you know, you just open.

246
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:11,753
It 's... so...

247
00:25:11,962 --> 00:25:15,398
we'll always be with you,
by your heart.

248
00:25:17,801 --> 00:25:20,599
-The cake.
-I forgot the cake.

249
00:25:24,775 --> 00:25:30,042
Would you look at her.
That woman is my passion.

250
00:25:30,914 --> 00:25:34,850
You would do well to find a passion.
Everyone needs a passion.

251
00:25:35,052 --> 00:25:40,115
What about geology?
I mean you like rocks and stuff.

252
00:25:46,864 --> 00:25:50,322
<i>I had found my passion</i>.
<i>You were my rock</i>.

253
00:25:50,534 --> 00:25:53,196
-Mom, I'm scared.
-They won't hurt you.

254
00:25:53,404 --> 00:25:54,530
Just remember
whenever you're scared...

255
00:25:54,738 --> 00:25:56,899
that means there's opportunity.

256
00:25:57,107 --> 00:25:58,131
What?

257
00:25:58,342 --> 00:26:02,438
It means there's magic lingering
around these parts.

258
00:26:02,646 --> 00:26:05,809
All sorts of chances to see things
you've never seen before.

259
00:26:06,216 --> 00:26:08,707
-Pick me up.
-Okay.

260
00:26:11,388 --> 00:26:14,084
The Bedouins believe
your dream will come true...

261
00:26:14,291 --> 00:26:17,783
if you whisper it into a sheep's
ear first thing after you wake up.

262
00:26:17,995 --> 00:26:20,463
-Who?
-Bedouins. They live in Africa.

263
00:26:20,664 --> 00:26:23,462
They are nomads. You ready?

264
00:26:23,734 --> 00:26:26,862
-You go first?
-Okay. I'll go first.

265
00:26:34,144 --> 00:26:39,810
Don't ever forget, my prince,
there is magic all around you.

266
00:26:40,217 --> 00:26:44,779
Look for those secrets
and you will be happy forever.

267
00:26:47,257 --> 00:26:48,918
Okay.

268
00:27:04,274 --> 00:27:05,673
What 's he gonna do?

269
00:27:06,009 --> 00:27:10,002
He's going to tell the gods.
But he told me to send you over.

270
00:27:12,015 --> 00:27:15,951
Here I come. I'm coming.

271
00:27:17,154 --> 00:27:21,090
-I'm not coming.
-Come on. Let 's go.

272
00:27:26,897 --> 00:27:31,732
Go ahead, he wants to hear
your dreams. Go on.

273
00:27:37,808 --> 00:27:42,711
I did it! I did it, Mommy!
Did you see? Did you see me?

274
00:27:42,913 --> 00:27:45,313
Yes.

275
00:28:39,303 --> 00:28:41,237
Will I be allowed
to paint in school?

276
00:28:41,438 --> 00:28:43,872
Not on the walls.

277
00:28:45,108 --> 00:28:47,372
God damn it!

278
00:28:47,778 --> 00:28:51,714
-Be very, very quiet.
-Why won't you start?!

279
00:28:51,915 --> 00:28:55,043
We're spies. Get on.

280
00:28:57,988 --> 00:29:00,218
Start!

281
00:29:00,457 --> 00:29:03,654
We cannot let the enemy see us.

282
00:29:04,695 --> 00:29:07,129
Piece of shit.

283
00:29:08,665 --> 00:29:11,793
Hello. Hello.

284
00:29:12,436 --> 00:29:14,666
Hello!

285
00:29:15,239 --> 00:29:17,400
-What 's up?
-Are they at home?

286
00:29:17,608 --> 00:29:20,008
-I don't know.
-Okay.

287
00:29:29,319 --> 00:29:31,253
-Is your mother home?
-Did you know...

288
00:29:31,455 --> 00:29:34,481
...daddy spiders have penises?
-What?

289
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:37,922
Hello.

290
00:29:38,929 --> 00:29:40,829
This is Paul, my son.

291
00:29:41,298 --> 00:29:43,858
Anita Biddle.
We just moved in across the street.

292
00:29:44,167 --> 00:29:46,533
-Hello.
-Hello.

293
00:29:47,971 --> 00:29:51,099
Sorry.
We were just painting Paul's room.

294
00:29:51,508 --> 00:29:53,237
-Purple.
-I see.

295
00:29:53,443 --> 00:29:56,173
And spying on you.

296
00:29:59,182 --> 00:30:04,848
Well, I just wanted
to introduce myself, and cake.

297
00:30:05,122 --> 00:30:07,522
Thank you.

298
00:30:08,825 --> 00:30:11,385
Thank you so much.

299
00:30:15,866 --> 00:30:19,427
-Shit!
<i>-Fitting in with the outside world</i>...

300
00:30:19,903 --> 00:30:24,465

<i>conformity, were never high</i>...

Okay. Abominable snowman.

308
00:31:51,328 --> 00:31:53,796
''Abdominal'' snowman.

309
00:31:53,997 --> 00:31:56,830
You're so good.

310
00:32:02,639 --> 00:32:05,369
Hey, Mom. Let 's go in.

311
00:32:05,842 --> 00:32:09,278
Would a god go into
a playground created by others?

312
00:32:09,479 --> 00:32:11,777
Or would he create his own new one?

313
00:32:11,982 --> 00:32:14,177
Please?

314
00:32:14,384 --> 00:32:18,684
Okay. Only for a little while.
Okay?

315
00:32:22,259 --> 00:32:25,228
Be careful, sweetie.

316
00:32:44,214 --> 00:32:46,739
Mom, a treasure.

317
00:32:46,950 --> 00:32:49,009
Let me see.

318
00:32:53,256 --> 00:32:57,454
Yes, certainly. This is a piece...

319
00:32:57,661 --> 00:33:02,189
that was left to the
God of Happy and Safe Homes.

320
00:33:14,711 --> 00:33:15,939
I'll see you later.

321
00:33:16,146 --> 00:33:17,374
Give me a call.

322
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:26,889
-Hi. I'm six.
-Me too.

323
00:33:27,624 --> 00:33:30,115
-No, you're not. You're Iying.
-I am not.

324
00:33:30,327 --> 00:33:33,592
Yes, you are. You'd be
in school if you were really six.

325
00:33:33,797 --> 00:33:37,164
-That 's the law.
-I am too six. I'm in home school.

326
00:33:37,567 --> 00:33:43,130
And today I was excavating a piece
of cup that 's a thousand years old.

327
00:33:45,375 --> 00:33:48,833
What? I was.
Come on, I can show you.

328
00:33:49,045 --> 00:33:51,605
My mom says your mom
does weird things.

329
00:33:51,815 --> 00:33:53,282
No. We both do.

330
00:33:55,152 --> 00:33:57,086
Hey! Loverboy!

331
00:33:57,287 --> 00:33:58,618
I'm having a Yu-Gi-Oh party.

332
00:33:58,822 --> 00:34:00,881
-Wanna come?
-Loverboy!

333
00:34:02,993 --> 00:34:06,485
-Loverboy.
-Of course I do.

334
00:34:08,431 --> 00:34:10,956
-Why couldn't I go?
-Because...

335
00:34:11,168 --> 00:34:14,968
we have more fun on our own
roam-abouts. Don't we?

336
00:34:15,172 --> 00:34:18,608
-Did they find magic pottery today?
-No.

337
00:34:18,809 --> 00:34:22,677
No. So, no need for tears.

338
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:26,513
You are my very special little boy.

339
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:29,912
Now eat your lamb.

340
00:34:38,829 --> 00:34:41,923
Where's my dad?

341
00:34:42,332 --> 00:34:44,197
What?

342
00:34:45,535 --> 00:34:47,560
Tell me.

343
00:34:51,741 --> 00:34:54,642
You do have a father.

344
00:34:54,945 --> 00:35:01,282
He is like our wanderer Odysseus,
trapped and sleepy...

345
00:35:01,484 --> 00:35:06,251
on some island so very far away from
us. And he is trying to get back.

346
00:35:06,456 --> 00:35:09,619
No more fairytales!
You're telling a fairytale lie.

347
00:35:09,826 --> 00:35:11,726
-I am not.
-No, no, no!

348
00:35:12,062 --> 00:35:14,394
I must have a father!

349
00:35:28,011 --> 00:35:30,912
Loverboy? Sweetie?

350
00:35:31,882 --> 00:35:34,282
I'm not here.

351
00:35:35,051 --> 00:35:38,077
I'm sorry.

352
00:35:38,588 --> 00:35:41,648
I must be mistaken. I thought
there was a Loverboy inside...

353
00:35:41,858 --> 00:35:45,988
because I have something for him.

354
00:35:47,197 --> 00:35:49,324
What?

355
00:35:49,532 --> 00:35:51,830
It 's a surprise.

356
00:35:52,102 --> 00:35:54,263
What kind of a surprise?

357
00:35:54,804 --> 00:36:00,106
It 's a huge one. The best kind.

358
00:36:01,845 --> 00:36:05,679
Look at his face.
What was he thinking?

359
00:36:05,882 --> 00:36:08,146
Maybe he wants
some more whipped cream.

360
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:12,611
Good idea.

361
00:36:13,223 --> 00:36:16,158
I love you, Miss Darling.

362
00:36:16,593 --> 00:36:19,494
I love you, Loverboy.

363
00:36:36,279 --> 00:36:39,077
Knock, knock.
Anybody home?

364
00:36:40,317 --> 00:36:41,841
Hello.

365
00:36:42,652 --> 00:36:45,382
Are you and Paul sleeping in there?

366
00:36:45,588 --> 00:36:47,283
Yes.

367
00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:49,924
You have a little something on your...

368
00:36:50,994 --> 00:36:53,622
Fudge sundaes.

369
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:57,960
Well, I'm crazed. Saturdays
make me postal. You know...

370
00:36:58,168 --> 00:37:00,693
AIlison's at ballet
and I have to pick Danny up...

371
00:37:00,904 --> 00:37:04,931
in ten minutes and take him to
Tae Kwon Do and I can' be late.

372
00:37:05,141 --> 00:37:07,541
So I wanted to give you these.

373
00:37:07,944 --> 00:37:11,038
-What is it?
-Registration for school.

374
00:37:13,216 --> 00:37:16,242
Thank you. We're fine.

375
00:37:16,453 --> 00:37:19,081
He needs other kids.

376
00:37:19,289 --> 00:37:22,417
I can't believe how much
AIlison's changed since she started.

377
00:37:23,426 --> 00:37:25,917
You can't keep him out
of school forever.

378
00:37:26,129 --> 00:37:30,566
But I wanna go to school.
I wanna ride the bus.

379
00:37:30,767 --> 00:37:33,600
Well, you will go.

380
00:37:33,803 --> 00:37:35,464
When?

381
00:37:35,672 --> 00:37:39,836
Soon. Maybe after Christmas.
We'll talk about it later.

382
00:37:40,276 --> 00:37:43,040
You're not Dr. Spock, you know.

383
00:37:43,613 --> 00:37:45,740
You're doing something wrong.

384
00:37:45,949 --> 00:37:51,444
Yo. I don't know where it came from.
I just found it on the yard.

385
00:37:53,089 --> 00:37:56,786
I swear I didn't hurt it.

386
00:37:56,993 --> 00:38:00,121
That 's where he lives?

387
00:38:01,598 --> 00:38:03,225
Where's his mommy?

388
00:38:03,433 --> 00:38:07,233
She's probabIy looking for something
for her babies to eat.

389
00:38:07,437 --> 00:38:11,032
Hear them?
There's a whole family up there.

390
00:38:11,241 --> 00:38:14,642
Mommy and lots of brothers
and sisters.

391
00:38:15,578 --> 00:38:18,638
What if they don't know where he is?

392
00:38:18,982 --> 00:38:21,780
Your baby is here!

393
00:38:21,985 --> 00:38:24,146
Better?

394
00:38:26,056 --> 00:38:28,354
Looks hurt.

395
00:38:28,558 --> 00:38:30,856
Maybe it was a cat.

396
00:38:31,261 --> 00:38:32,922
What if he's scared?

397
00:38:33,129 --> 00:38:37,395
Then we'll be right inside,
and I will not take my mind off him.

398
00:38:38,368 --> 00:38:41,462
Me too. I won't either.

399
00:38:57,821 --> 00:39:01,154
Remember, whenever you feel scared...

400
00:39:01,357 --> 00:39:04,520
that means there's opportunity.

401
00:39:13,203 --> 00:39:17,936
''Kiss me through the hole
of this vile wall.

402
00:39:18,141 --> 00:39:22,840
I kissed the wall's hole,
not your lips at all.

403
00:39:23,079 --> 00:39:26,776
Wilt thou at Ninny's tomb
meet me straightaway?

404
00:39:26,983 --> 00:39:30,384
'Tide life, 'tide death...

405
00:39:30,587 --> 00:39:33,522
I come without delay.''

406
00:39:53,076 --> 00:39:56,204
<i>I could've told you about death</i>.

407
00:39:56,412 --> 00:39:59,404
<i>That the bird was going to die</i>.

408
00:39:59,616 --> 00:40:02,983
<i>We would've buried</i>
<i>the little guy in a hole</i>.

409
00:40:03,186 --> 00:40:05,620
<i>You would've decorated the grave</i>...

410
00:40:05,822 --> 00:40:10,885
<i>and I would've held you</i>,
<i>tears streaming down your cheeks</i>...

411
00:40:11,094 --> 00:40:14,962
<i>and told you everything</i>
<i>would be fine again</i>.

412
00:40:59,842 --> 00:41:03,005
Marty. Marty, look.

413
00:41:03,213 --> 00:41:06,512
I've been wondering
where you could buy those feeders.

414
00:41:06,783 --> 00:41:11,220
I've been noticing them a lot
on the front lawns like on Laurel.

415
00:41:11,421 --> 00:41:13,184
Well, sweetie, do you want one?

416
00:41:14,257 --> 00:41:16,851
Yeah!
I think they look real nice.

417
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:19,551
Well hell, let 's get ourselves
a birdfeeder.

418
00:41:19,762 --> 00:41:21,593
And Emily can keep it filled.

419
00:41:21,798 --> 00:41:24,289
Would you like that, Em?

420
00:41:28,571 --> 00:41:31,802
Never mind.
Let 's come back if you want.

421
00:41:32,008 --> 00:41:34,670
Okay.

422
00:41:36,479 --> 00:41:40,506
-So I'm thinking of a person.
-And is that person living?

423
00:41:55,865 --> 00:41:59,426
Mommy, Mommy, he's gone.
His mom must 've come.

424
00:41:59,636 --> 00:42:02,264
There's a bag of sandwiches
in the kitchen. Please get it.

425
00:42:02,872 --> 00:42:05,705
-Are we going somewhere?
-Yes.

426
00:42:05,908 --> 00:42:07,773
On a little trip.

427
00:42:07,977 --> 00:42:09,638
But you didn't say anything before.

428
00:42:09,846 --> 00:42:11,746
Does that mean we cannot go?

429
00:42:11,948 --> 00:42:13,347
No.

430
00:42:13,549 --> 00:42:17,747
Good. Because not everyone
around here needs to know about it.

431
00:42:17,954 --> 00:42:21,515
Now please go upstairs
and get dressed.

432
00:42:52,822 --> 00:42:55,882
<i>Mrs. Harker was no stranger</i>
<i>to sadness</i>.

433
00:42:56,092 --> 00:42:57,992
I was hoping you'd stop by.

434
00:42:58,594 --> 00:43:02,121
-We missed you.
-I like the music.

435
00:43:02,332 --> 00:43:06,462
<i>One of her sons had drunk something</i>
<i>unsealed, marked, Poison</i>.

436
00:43:06,669 --> 00:43:09,297
<i>And now he was</i>
<i>permanently damaged</i>.

437
00:43:09,505 --> 00:43:10,995
Mom, where's my rabbit 's foot?

438
00:43:11,207 --> 00:43:13,573
-I don't know.
-Go away.

439
00:43:13,776 --> 00:43:15,676
Don't be such a drag, darling.

440
00:43:22,552 --> 00:43:26,010
So, tell me everything
about your day.

441
00:43:26,222 --> 00:43:27,416
It was okay.

442
00:43:27,690 --> 00:43:29,885
Some kid put a sign
on another kid's back that said:

443
00:43:30,093 --> 00:43:34,086
...''Scream at me, I'm deaf.''
-Oh dear. Is he?

444
00:43:34,897 --> 00:43:37,024
No. That was the joke.

445
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,231
Oh, that 's terrible.

446
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:46,599
What else?

447
00:43:46,876 --> 00:43:48,275
The school just hired
a shop teacher...

448
00:43:48,478 --> 00:43:50,446
...with a wooden leg.
-Stop.

449
00:43:50,813 --> 00:43:53,247
That is too good to be true.
You can't be serious.

450
00:43:53,950 --> 00:43:56,680
Cross my heart.

451
00:43:57,587 --> 00:44:02,422
If we could all be just slightly more
ironic I think I could giggle forever.

452
00:44:08,564 --> 00:44:10,555
What do you think of my outfit?
It 's good, right?

453
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:13,462
It 's really good, yes.

454
00:44:18,441 --> 00:44:20,909
Okay. We must go in.

455
00:44:21,477 --> 00:44:24,139
We're both tired and it 's time.

456
00:44:24,347 --> 00:44:26,941
And the sun is lowering.

457
00:45:01,584 --> 00:45:03,882
Okay.

458
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:10,288
Is this the ocean?

459
00:45:10,493 --> 00:45:13,724
Yes. Go back to sleep.
We'll see it in the morning.

460
00:45:13,930 --> 00:45:16,194
-I wanna go to the beach.
-Tomorrow, love.

461
00:45:16,399 --> 00:45:20,233
We came to the beach,
we should go to the beach.

462
00:45:29,779 --> 00:45:32,771
-Wow, cool. Did you hear it?
-Hear what?

463
00:45:32,982 --> 00:45:35,314
The wind.

464
00:45:36,018 --> 00:45:40,455
-So what 's the wind say?
-That sometimes it 's too cold on here.

465
00:45:40,656 --> 00:45:41,918
Windpipes?

466
00:45:42,124 --> 00:45:45,321
But today the wind says
it 's warm enough to blow.

467
00:45:45,528 --> 00:45:47,792
-See the house!
-Wait, wait, wait.

468
00:45:48,464 --> 00:45:52,195
Let 's close our eyes
and wish upon the wind.

469
00:45:56,606 --> 00:45:59,040
Did it. What did you wish?

470
00:45:59,242 --> 00:46:03,906
I wished that we could
always be together...

471
00:46:04,113 --> 00:46:06,411
Loverboy and Miss Darling.

472
00:46:06,616 --> 00:46:08,049
What did you wish?

473
00:46:08,251 --> 00:46:12,312
I cannot tell you.
If I tell, it will never come true.

474
00:46:13,689 --> 00:46:15,816
Come on!

475
00:46:31,607 --> 00:46:34,405
Hey, look, a crab!

476
00:46:35,378 --> 00:46:37,073
Come here, pick him up.

477
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:41,273
-I'm scared, Mom.
-Come on. He wants to be friends.

478
00:46:42,852 --> 00:46:45,320
Here you go.

479
00:46:48,724 --> 00:46:51,750
See? You were scared.

480
00:46:51,961 --> 00:46:54,555
And now you are neighbors
with a crab.

481
00:46:54,764 --> 00:46:56,891
Congratulations, Loverboy.

482
00:46:57,099 --> 00:46:58,691
Hi!

483
00:46:59,936 --> 00:47:03,030
Jeannette Rawley.
I rented you the place.

484
00:47:04,373 --> 00:47:06,933
Fresh-baked blueberry muffins.

485
00:47:07,143 --> 00:47:10,704
We've got so many berries here,
you've gotta do something with them.

486
00:47:10,913 --> 00:47:12,039
Right.

487
00:47:12,248 --> 00:47:16,651
I told you about the tide. Comes in
every afternoon, covers the bridge.

488
00:47:16,852 --> 00:47:19,082
So you're pretty well
stranded out here.

489
00:47:19,655 --> 00:47:22,681
Suits us just fine. Paul.

490
00:47:22,892 --> 00:47:25,156
Good. It gets to some people.

491
00:47:25,361 --> 00:47:27,795
-Not us.
-Listen. We're having our...

492
00:47:27,997 --> 00:47:31,160
annual goodbye weekenders clambake
this afternoon. You'll come, yeah?

493
00:47:32,201 --> 00:47:34,135
Sorry, we can't.
Thank you, though.

494
00:47:34,337 --> 00:47:36,897
-Why not?
-Well?

495
00:47:39,609 --> 00:47:42,976
I promised him we'd bake a cake.
Well, you know kids.

496
00:47:43,179 --> 00:47:46,671
Good. Bake it and bring it on over.
We're having lobster.

497
00:47:46,882 --> 00:47:49,578
-Real lobster?
-Well, you betcha, kiddo.

498
00:47:51,020 --> 00:47:54,387
You know, Paul's never had lobster
before, and I'm just, I'm not...

499
00:47:54,590 --> 00:47:58,082
Mom, you always say,
try new things.

500
00:47:58,761 --> 00:48:03,596
There. Festivities begin at 3 o'clock.
I'll see you then. Bye.

501
00:48:04,533 --> 00:48:08,094
Please, Mom, please?
The party will be fun.

502
00:48:12,074 --> 00:48:15,703
We bought this place...
thirty years ago.

503
00:48:17,146 --> 00:48:19,205
-Haven't regretted it for a minute.
-Another martini?

504
00:48:19,415 --> 00:48:21,542
Yes, please.

505
00:48:21,917 --> 00:48:26,286
Here you go. You're gonna like
this one. This is my best.

506
00:48:26,489 --> 00:48:28,150
They get better as the day goes on,
I think.

507
00:48:28,357 --> 00:48:30,188
Come here, boy. Come here.

508
00:48:30,393 --> 00:48:32,554
Finally. The lobsters.

509
00:48:34,330 --> 00:48:37,060
Sure. Thanks for that.

510
00:48:38,034 --> 00:48:40,901
-Hello, sweetheart.
-Hey, Mark.

511
00:48:41,103 --> 00:48:43,003
Are you the lobster man?

512
00:48:43,205 --> 00:48:45,002
-Yeah.
-No. Mark, my nephew.

513
00:48:45,207 --> 00:48:48,142
-This is Emily Stoll and Paul.
-Good to meet you guys.

514
00:48:49,512 --> 00:48:51,707
-Mark's a geologist.
-Wonderful.

515
00:48:51,914 --> 00:48:54,576
She's not bragging, just explaining
the dirt under his fingernails.

516
00:48:54,784 --> 00:48:56,376
-True.
-Unfortunately the only dirt...

517
00:48:56,585 --> 00:48:59,611
under my fingernails
at this point is city grime.

518
00:48:59,822 --> 00:49:02,017
I'm working on my thesis.

519
00:49:04,427 --> 00:49:05,792
And this is Rocky.

520
00:49:05,995 --> 00:49:08,088
-Hey, boy! Hey, good boy.
-Don't eat that.

521
00:49:08,297 --> 00:49:09,924
-Hey, you.
-Don't eat that.

522
00:49:10,232 --> 00:49:13,099
-He'll eat anything.
-Here. Want some of this?

523
00:49:14,370 --> 00:49:16,736
We're gonna
get this dinner going.

524
00:49:16,939 --> 00:49:18,839
Pull these off, it 's good meat.

525
00:49:28,617 --> 00:49:30,312
You know Rocky's gonna
choke on that.

526
00:49:30,519 --> 00:49:35,479
It 's all right. He ate an entire
bicycle tire last week. He'll be fine.

527
00:49:35,691 --> 00:49:36,885
Well, suit yourself.

528
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:40,461
-Okay, Sailor boy, it 's time to go.
-AIready?

529
00:49:42,098 --> 00:49:44,396
Mark's gonna take me fishing
some time.

530
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,092
Really?

531
00:49:46,302 --> 00:49:49,396
I think I have to clear that with
your mom first. But I'd like to.

532
00:49:50,272 --> 00:49:51,671
Thought you were land-based.

533
00:49:51,874 --> 00:49:53,774
Actually amphibious.

534
00:49:54,710 --> 00:49:56,871
Well, that will depend.

535
00:49:57,279 --> 00:49:58,405
On what?

536
00:49:58,614 --> 00:50:02,550
Thank you very much for a
delicious dinner and a lovely time.

537
00:50:02,752 --> 00:50:05,220
Now bow.

538
00:50:05,821 --> 00:50:07,448
-Thank you. It was our pleasure.
-Yeah.

539
00:50:07,656 --> 00:50:09,817
I'll stop by tomorrow.
I never got any dirt out of you.

540
00:50:10,025 --> 00:50:12,084
And she will.

541
00:50:12,561 --> 00:50:15,621
I'm serious about fishing.
Any time.

542
00:50:16,665 --> 00:50:17,962
-Good night.
-Bye.

543
00:50:18,167 --> 00:50:19,566
-Bye-bye.
-Sweet dreams.

544
00:50:19,769 --> 00:50:21,396
Okay.

545
00:50:21,604 --> 00:50:24,402
I like her.
Seems like a good mom.

546
00:50:25,141 --> 00:50:27,075
Yeah, easy on the eye too, huh?

547
00:50:27,743 --> 00:50:32,077
-I'm gonna plead the fifth.
-You can plead whatever you want.

548
00:50:52,935 --> 00:50:55,699
-Morning.
-Are we going fishing?

549
00:50:56,438 --> 00:51:01,068
I need to talk to your mom about
that. Take a look at this.

550
00:51:01,944 --> 00:51:05,345
This here is everything you need
to know about saltwater fishing.

551
00:51:05,548 --> 00:51:09,780
It 's a definitive guide to... fish.

552
00:51:11,086 --> 00:51:13,145
Cool, but she's still sleeping.

553
00:51:13,355 --> 00:51:16,347
Yeah? I do need some
help with something.

554
00:51:17,293 --> 00:51:19,386
How handy are you with a hammer?

555
00:51:19,595 --> 00:51:22,826
-I've hammered since I was a boy.
-Really?

556
00:51:23,132 --> 00:51:25,293
That 's true.

557
00:51:25,601 --> 00:51:27,125
Morning.

558
00:51:27,469 --> 00:51:30,097
Put your sneakers on,
please, Loverboy.

559
00:51:30,306 --> 00:51:32,706
Don't call me that, Mom.
I'm Paul.

560
00:51:33,108 --> 00:51:36,202
Sneakers, please.

561
00:51:38,113 --> 00:51:40,240
You're okay with this, right?

562
00:51:40,583 --> 00:51:42,312
The boat has some rotten planks.

563
00:51:42,518 --> 00:51:45,316
I thought I could use it
as a carpentry lesson.

564
00:51:45,521 --> 00:51:48,786
I'm not comfortable letting him
out of my sight, actually...

565
00:51:48,991 --> 00:51:50,481
with the ocean and everything.

566
00:51:50,826 --> 00:51:54,592
It 's funny you should mention that,
as coincidence would have it...

567
00:51:54,797 --> 00:51:57,095
the storm washed it up
here last night.

568
00:51:57,299 --> 00:51:59,824
Ready. Let 's go!

569
00:52:00,035 --> 00:52:04,563
And, by the way, nice jimmies.

570
00:52:10,412 --> 00:52:12,642
-Shit.
-Hey, cool, a spider.

571
00:52:12,848 --> 00:52:15,248
-Where?
-Right there. See?

572
00:52:15,451 --> 00:52:17,248
Yeah, leave him alone.
He's not gonna hurt you.

573
00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:20,752
Good job.

574
00:52:22,524 --> 00:52:24,185
Shit.

575
00:52:33,002 --> 00:52:34,799
Is it okay if I hit this nail?

576
00:52:35,004 --> 00:52:38,269
-Hi.
-Mom, we did it. It was rotten.

577
00:52:38,474 --> 00:52:40,567
-Tell me.
-Three boards were rotten.

578
00:52:40,776 --> 00:52:43,574
-We took them out.
-I'm so proud of you.

579
00:52:43,779 --> 00:52:46,043
Kid's good with a hammer.

580
00:52:46,949 --> 00:52:49,782
Guys hungry?
I got sandwiches and ding dongs.

581
00:52:49,985 --> 00:52:51,384
Mom, we don't have time.

582
00:52:51,587 --> 00:52:53,714
Mark says we gotta
get this boat in the water.

583
00:52:54,123 --> 00:52:55,818
I thought we were going
on a roam-about.

584
00:52:56,025 --> 00:52:59,085
-But I wanna go with him. Can I go?
-We're just gonna be offshore.

585
00:52:59,295 --> 00:53:01,058
And we got these.

586
00:53:02,164 --> 00:53:05,258
-Come on, let 's go.
-Cool.

587
00:53:07,469 --> 00:53:10,336
-Can I come with you guys?
-Mom, it 's for boys.

588
00:53:10,572 --> 00:53:12,733
You're not supposed to.

589
00:53:12,942 --> 00:53:14,671
Sorry.

590
00:53:17,346 --> 00:53:20,076
Boys only. We won't be long.

591
00:53:20,916 --> 00:53:22,747
-You ready?
-Cool car.

592
00:53:22,952 --> 00:53:24,852
-You like it?
-Yeah.

593
00:53:25,054 --> 00:53:28,353
-Well, I'll sell it to you.
-Seatbelt!

594
00:53:41,837 --> 00:53:44,635
Hi. You guys okay?

595
00:53:50,646 --> 00:53:52,739
God.

596
00:54:03,325 --> 00:54:05,293
Why do you think it 's called skate?

597
00:54:05,661 --> 00:54:08,061
Because of the way it goes
through the water?

598
00:54:08,263 --> 00:54:10,163
-Well...
-Maybe next year I'll catch one.

599
00:54:10,599 --> 00:54:14,330
-Right? After school?
-What school?

600
00:54:14,536 --> 00:54:17,027
Mom... remember, you promised.

601
00:54:17,239 --> 00:54:20,140
We'll leave on Saturday
so I can start school.

602
00:54:20,275 --> 00:54:23,540
You know, I was thinking,
since we're having so much fun...

603
00:54:23,746 --> 00:54:26,010
...maybe we can stay on a bit longer.
-No.

604
00:54:26,215 --> 00:54:29,776
And you know, I spoke to Jeannette.
And since the cabin's not rented...

605
00:54:29,985 --> 00:54:32,317
-Where you going?
-To tell Jeannette...

606
00:54:32,521 --> 00:54:35,752
...we can't stay.
-Slow down, kiddo. We're fine.

607
00:54:35,958 --> 00:54:37,550
Sit down.

608
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:41,093
I have school. We can come back
here in the summer. Right?

609
00:54:41,296 --> 00:54:43,355
Of course.

610
00:54:46,201 --> 00:54:49,864
I think Mark knows
a lot about a lot of things.

611
00:54:50,072 --> 00:54:52,540
Like you?

612
00:54:53,642 --> 00:54:57,703
Now, excuse me, young captain.
A good night kiss, please.

613
00:54:59,448 --> 00:55:02,144
-I'm gonna read for a little while.
-Okay.

614
00:55:02,351 --> 00:55:04,182
I think my dad's like Mark.

615
00:55:04,386 --> 00:55:07,913
-You do?
-Yeah. I like Mark.

616
00:55:24,406 --> 00:55:28,365
So I hear you're very good
with astronomy.

617
00:55:28,577 --> 00:55:31,774
Paul tells me you can identify
every constellation.

618
00:55:31,980 --> 00:55:34,107
Just Pegasus.

619
00:55:34,316 --> 00:55:39,083
I still haven't figured out exactly
where that Big Dipper is located.

620
00:55:41,557 --> 00:55:44,321
I have to tell you, I was a little
surprised when you called.

621
00:55:44,860 --> 00:55:47,226
-Really?
-Yeah.

622
00:55:47,830 --> 00:55:49,297
Well...

623
00:55:49,698 --> 00:55:52,462
I was kind of surprised, too.

624
00:55:52,935 --> 00:55:54,596
About what?

625
00:55:55,737 --> 00:55:58,228
You haven't asked me about my...

626
00:56:00,576 --> 00:56:03,101
relationship status.

627
00:56:03,312 --> 00:56:05,109
Well, I guess I haven't.

628
00:56:06,048 --> 00:56:10,178
Well, here's to my self-restraint.

629
00:56:10,986 --> 00:56:13,819
To your self-restraint.

630
00:56:14,590 --> 00:56:19,357
How long do you figure I have
to exercise that attribute?

631
00:56:25,534 --> 00:56:28,094
I was thinking...

632
00:56:28,303 --> 00:56:31,830
if you're writing your thesis,
can't you do that from anywhere?

633
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:35,100
That all depends.

634
00:56:37,513 --> 00:56:39,947
Loverboy and I were thinking
about staying on through the winter.

635
00:56:40,149 --> 00:56:42,674
Don't call me that!

636
00:56:42,885 --> 00:56:45,149
-We're not staying!
-Hey!

637
00:56:46,989 --> 00:56:49,719
-Calm down.
-Let go of me! Let go of me!

638
00:56:49,925 --> 00:56:51,916
Stop it. Calm down.
Just calm down.

639
00:56:52,127 --> 00:56:53,890
Stop. I'm going to school!

640
00:56:54,396 --> 00:56:56,193
-Paul...
-Let go of me! Stop!

641
00:56:56,398 --> 00:56:58,161
You're gonna do
what I tell you to do! Stop it!

642
00:56:58,367 --> 00:56:59,664
-No! No!
-Stop it!

643
00:56:59,868 --> 00:57:02,496
-Let go!
-Paul!

644
00:57:02,704 --> 00:57:05,036
Get back here! No!

645
00:57:51,987 --> 00:57:53,921
Mrs. Harker?

646
00:57:57,826 --> 00:58:02,058
Mrs. Harker? Is there anybody there?
It 's me, Emily.

647
00:58:02,264 --> 00:58:04,630
Hello.

648
00:58:04,833 --> 00:58:06,630
Hello?

649
00:58:11,139 --> 00:58:14,540
<i>But Mrs. Harker was gone</i>.

650
00:58:28,090 --> 00:58:30,058
<i>Mom. Mom</i>...

651
00:58:30,259 --> 00:58:32,022
wake up.

652
00:58:33,295 --> 00:58:37,163
Wow... You are dressed.

653
00:58:37,366 --> 00:58:41,803
Yeah, I am.
I picked it out all by myself.

654
00:58:42,070 --> 00:58:44,163
Yes, you did.

655
00:58:44,373 --> 00:58:46,603
I'll meet you downstairs.

656
00:59:08,930 --> 00:59:11,694
Wait. I want you to call
if there's any problem...

657
00:59:11,900 --> 00:59:15,165
or you wanna come home.
Okay? So here's some change.

658
00:59:15,370 --> 00:59:16,564
I want you to put the money in...

659
00:59:16,772 --> 00:59:18,797
and dial our number
just like we practiced.

660
00:59:19,007 --> 00:59:22,101
-Can I just have the teacher call?
-No.

661
00:59:22,544 --> 00:59:25,513
Come on, sweetheart.
Come on, sweetheart.

662
00:59:25,781 --> 00:59:30,150
Hey, kiddo! Give me
a fighting chance to keep up.

663
00:59:30,352 --> 00:59:32,445
Mom...

664
00:59:32,721 --> 00:59:34,712
I don't want you to come in with me.

665
00:59:35,624 --> 00:59:37,251
-But...
-I'm not a baby.

666
00:59:37,459 --> 00:59:40,326
No one else's mother is here.

667
01:00:06,088 --> 01:00:08,454
You can't have it. I made it.
It 's better than yours.

668
01:00:08,657 --> 01:00:12,388
-Give it to me.
-No. Catch me, first.

669
01:00:12,894 --> 01:00:15,658
You have to get it!

670
01:00:15,864 --> 01:00:17,354
Come on!

671
01:00:17,766 --> 01:00:20,758
Loverboy, be careful!

672
01:00:21,069 --> 01:00:24,732
-Is that your mom?
-Hi!

673
01:00:26,375 --> 01:00:29,242
Poof, I am gone.

674
01:00:30,912 --> 01:00:33,972
Just don't run with the stick.

675
01:00:35,083 --> 01:00:39,417
Vegetable. Vegetable. Bread.

676
01:00:40,789 --> 01:00:42,882
What are you doing?

677
01:00:43,091 --> 01:00:46,390
Counting food groups.
We learned about 'em today.

678
01:00:46,595 --> 01:00:48,529
Miss Silken says we should eat five...

679
01:00:48,730 --> 01:00:51,062
Miss Silken?
Is that the name of your teacher?

680
01:00:51,266 --> 01:00:54,895
Yes. She's really nice
and everyone in school likes her.

681
01:00:55,103 --> 01:00:56,695
I see.

682
01:00:57,139 --> 01:00:59,539
So you do not mind sitting
in a chair all day long?

683
01:00:59,741 --> 01:01:02,335
-Nope.
-No.

684
01:01:02,544 --> 01:01:05,069
No. That 's another thing.

685
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:07,771
Miss Silken says
I say strange things.

686
01:01:08,750 --> 01:01:12,652
Well, perhaps that is because
she's having a hard time keeping up.

687
01:01:18,827 --> 01:01:21,796
Miss Silken says mine
was one of the best in the class.

688
01:01:22,097 --> 01:01:23,257
One of the best?

689
01:01:23,465 --> 01:01:27,663
Only four other students got
both a smiley face and a gold star.

690
01:01:27,869 --> 01:01:29,860
Well, whoopie.

691
01:01:30,772 --> 01:01:33,002
Won't you hang it
on the refrigerator?

692
01:01:33,208 --> 01:01:34,402
No, I won't.

693
01:01:34,609 --> 01:01:37,874
If you want to paint me something
somewhat original, then I will.

694
01:01:38,079 --> 01:01:41,571
Or perhaps sing me The Marseillaise
like we used to, then I'll take note.

695
01:01:41,783 --> 01:01:44,946
So far everything Miss Silken says
interests me not at all.

696
01:01:48,623 --> 01:01:51,558
I pitched a tent in the back yard and
I thought maybe we could camp out...

697
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:52,920
to celebrate your first day
home from school...

698
01:01:53,128 --> 01:01:56,791
-I don't want to.
-You do not want to?

699
01:01:56,998 --> 01:02:01,059
No. It 's important I get
a good night 's sleep for tomorrow.

700
01:02:04,239 --> 01:02:05,536
Ask Miss Silken who was...

701
01:02:05,740 --> 01:02:08,834
the first prime minister
of an independent India.

702
01:02:09,845 --> 01:02:13,042
That 's India, not Indiana.

703
01:02:14,416 --> 01:02:15,849
<i>Miss Silken</i>...

704
01:02:16,051 --> 01:02:20,317
<i>with her nicely-crossed ankles</i>,
<i>and her well-constructed rules</i>.

705
01:02:20,522 --> 01:02:22,547
<i>Gold stars on a chart</i>.

706
01:02:22,757 --> 01:02:26,784
<i>Beating every ounce</i>
<i>of exceptional out of you</i>.

707
01:02:26,995 --> 01:02:28,963
<i>It had happened to me</i>.

708
01:02:29,164 --> 01:02:31,894
<i>I would not let it happen to you</i>.

709
01:02:32,100 --> 01:02:33,829
Stop it.

710
01:02:34,503 --> 01:02:37,165
Wanna go inside, Mom.

711
01:02:37,372 --> 01:02:41,035
I'm tired.
I know how to drive already.

712
01:02:43,378 --> 01:02:45,539
Do you want it out?

713
01:02:46,047 --> 01:02:48,743
-Let me yank it out.
-What? You will?

714
01:02:48,950 --> 01:02:51,646
Sure. Then we have
to stay in here tonight.

715
01:02:51,953 --> 01:02:54,717
We are sleeping in the car.

716
01:02:55,423 --> 01:02:56,981
No, Mom.

717
01:02:57,192 --> 01:03:00,127
Miss Silken told us you need
to put it under your pillow.

718
01:03:00,328 --> 01:03:04,662
She is wrong. You need to sleep
in the spot where the tooth fell out.

719
01:03:05,033 --> 01:03:07,661
-That 's not right.
-Yes, Paul.

720
01:03:08,036 --> 01:03:10,266
Which of us has lost their teeth?

721
01:03:10,472 --> 01:03:13,441
Which of us has received
tooth fairy visits?

722
01:03:13,642 --> 01:03:18,511
Now lean back, and close your eyes.

723
01:03:20,148 --> 01:03:22,776
Promise I'll be okay?

724
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:26,820
I promise.

725
01:03:27,022 --> 01:03:29,183
''Thy eternal summer
shall not fade

726
01:03:29,391 --> 01:03:31,689
nor lose possession of
that fair thou ow 'st

727
01:03:31,893 --> 01:03:34,418
nor shall death brag
thou wander'st in shade

728
01:03:34,629 --> 01:03:37,530
when in eternal lines
to time thou grow'st''

729
01:03:37,732 --> 01:03:40,394
-Marty.
-Mom, what 're they doing? Mom.

730
01:03:40,969 --> 01:03:44,735
''So long as men can breathe,
or eyes can see

731
01:03:44,940 --> 01:03:48,535
so long lives this,
and this gives life to thee''

732
01:03:55,650 --> 01:03:59,882
And that beautiful sonnet
was written by whom?

733
01:04:00,088 --> 01:04:02,579
-Shakespeare.
-Full name, please?

734
01:04:02,791 --> 01:04:06,090
-William Shakespeare.
-And did you know that in his time...

735
01:04:06,294 --> 01:04:10,025
all the female roles
were performed by young boys?

736
01:04:10,231 --> 01:04:11,220
Yes.

737
01:04:11,433 --> 01:04:16,029
Thank you, Diana. That was,
well, as lovely as a summer's day.

738
01:04:16,237 --> 01:04:20,105
And she memorized it all by herself.

739
01:04:22,510 --> 01:04:24,774
Ladies and gentlemen,
our next performer...

740
01:04:25,413 --> 01:04:29,611
performing a song
by a rock'n' roll singer...

741
01:04:29,818 --> 01:04:32,116
a capella, Emily Stoll...

742
01:04:32,320 --> 01:04:35,483
performing ''Life on Stars''.

743
01:04:35,690 --> 01:04:37,123
She looks weird.

744
01:04:37,559 --> 01:04:39,083
-''Mars''.
-What?

745
01:04:39,294 --> 01:04:41,489
''Life on Mars''.

746
01:04:42,097 --> 01:04:44,088
Sweetie, now are you sure
that you don't want...

747
01:04:44,299 --> 01:04:47,063
Mr. Frankel to accompany you
on piano?

748
01:04:47,268 --> 01:04:50,601
-No, thank you.
-Okay.

749
01:04:58,246 --> 01:05:04,913
<i>It's a god-awful small affair</i>
<i>To the girl with the mousy hair</i>

750
01:05:05,120 --> 01:05:08,487
<i>But her mummy is yelling no</i>

751
01:05:08,690 --> 01:05:11,853
<i>And her daddy has told her to go</i>

752
01:05:12,060 --> 01:05:15,461
<i>But the film is a saddening bore</i>

753
01:05:15,664 --> 01:05:19,156
<i>For she's lived it ten times or more</i>

754
01:05:19,367 --> 01:05:22,564
<i>She could spit in the eyes of fools</i>

755
01:05:22,771 --> 01:05:28,903
<i>As they ask her to focus on sailors</i>
<i>Fighting in the dance hall</i>

756
01:05:29,377 --> 01:05:33,313
<i>Oh man, look at those cavemen go</i>

757
01:05:33,515 --> 01:05:36,313
<i>It's the freakiest show</i>

758
01:05:37,185 --> 01:05:42,248
Not it 's not, baby. No.
This is not what we practiced.

759
01:05:44,859 --> 01:05:47,692
<i>He's in the best-selling show</i>

760
01:05:48,163 --> 01:05:53,897
<i>Is there life on Mars?</i>

761
01:05:59,607 --> 01:06:03,600
-This is...
-All right. All right. It 's okay.

762
01:06:08,516 --> 01:06:10,643
It 's okay.

763
01:06:19,994 --> 01:06:23,555
-Was that supposed to be about us?
-No.

764
01:06:24,332 --> 01:06:29,292
Well it sure sounded like
a con... con... condemnation.

765
01:06:29,971 --> 01:06:32,201
-I like the song.
-Don't bullshit us, young lady.

766
01:06:32,407 --> 01:06:33,965
Nobody could like that song.

767
01:06:34,175 --> 01:06:37,110
You picked that song deliberately
to humiliate us.

768
01:06:37,746 --> 01:06:40,180
-I promise I didn't.
-Everybody else did a poem.

769
01:06:40,381 --> 01:06:43,839
You sing a song by a druggie and...
What 's his name?

770
01:06:44,052 --> 01:06:46,020
It 's Bowie Something,
I don't know. He's English.

771
01:06:46,755 --> 01:06:49,349
-I'm sorry.
-Please, save it.

772
01:06:50,625 --> 01:06:54,584
And why those stupid tights?

773
01:06:55,396 --> 01:06:57,057
Your mother is...

774
01:06:59,033 --> 01:07:01,797
Your mother is correct.
They are ugIy.

775
01:07:14,415 --> 01:07:18,476
I hope you are aware
that your father is not well.

776
01:07:27,362 --> 01:07:29,455
-So do it.
-Are you sure?

777
01:07:29,664 --> 01:07:32,224
-Yes.
-Okay.

778
01:07:35,670 --> 01:07:38,264
Here we go.

779
01:07:40,074 --> 01:07:42,406
Is this what you want?

780
01:07:51,820 --> 01:07:53,981
It didn't hurt, you know?

781
01:08:02,397 --> 01:08:04,661
All those who disobey us
will be taken into jail.

782
01:08:06,467 --> 01:08:09,300
-Guys, look!
-What is it?

783
01:08:09,704 --> 01:08:12,172
A geode. My mom found it.

784
01:08:12,373 --> 01:08:14,398
-It 's so pretty.
-I found it in the driveway.

785
01:08:14,609 --> 01:08:17,305
There might be hundreds of them.
M&M's?

786
01:08:17,679 --> 01:08:20,477
-I'm not allowed.
-Fiddledee-dee.

787
01:08:21,783 --> 01:08:24,650
Paul and I are going to Mexico
in the summer to search for gold.

788
01:08:24,853 --> 01:08:26,184
-Aren't we, Paul?
-Sure.

789
01:08:26,387 --> 01:08:29,117
Sure we are.
And then maybe to Alaska...

790
01:08:29,324 --> 01:08:31,315
to see the giant whales.
I think it 's much better...

791
01:08:31,526 --> 01:08:35,155
to see things in real life
than in books. Don't you?

792
01:09:29,984 --> 01:09:32,612
-Good morning, Mr. Pomeroy.
-Dear, not again?

793
01:09:32,820 --> 01:09:34,685
I'm afraid so.
He was up almost the entire night...

794
01:09:34,889 --> 01:09:37,915
...and his throat almost closed.
-Heavens! That 's horrible.

795
01:09:38,126 --> 01:09:41,892
I tried to stay as calm as I could,
because I didn't wanna frighten him.

796
01:09:42,096 --> 01:09:44,894
Well, you did the right thing.
That 's the right thing to do.

797
01:09:45,099 --> 01:09:47,260
But I was just about
a second away from calling 911.

798
01:09:47,468 --> 01:09:50,028
Do you know that we once
had a little girl here who...

799
01:09:50,238 --> 01:09:54,106
as it turned out, was allergic
to the silverware in the cafeteria?

800
01:09:54,309 --> 01:09:55,799
Really?

801
01:09:56,544 --> 01:09:59,104
And as soon as
she switched to plastic ware...

802
01:09:59,314 --> 01:10:00,747
...cleared right up.
-That 's good.

803
01:10:00,949 --> 01:10:02,439
But Paul...

804
01:10:03,318 --> 01:10:05,513
he just seems so normal.

805
01:10:05,720 --> 01:10:07,278
-Normal?
-Healthy.

806
01:10:07,889 --> 01:10:13,191
Who would suspect that he would
have all of these crazy allergies?

807
01:10:13,995 --> 01:10:17,362
Do you think that it could be
something at home?

808
01:10:17,565 --> 01:10:21,194
-Why would you say that?
-I was speaking to Miss Silken.

809
01:10:21,469 --> 01:10:25,838
And she doesn't think that
he's allergic to anything here.

810
01:10:26,240 --> 01:10:28,333
You know, it 's funny
that you should say that...

811
01:10:28,543 --> 01:10:31,068
because I was actually
thinking the same thing.

812
01:10:31,279 --> 01:10:33,873
I was thinking that it
could be a mold...

813
01:10:34,082 --> 01:10:37,415
...that we can't see in our house.
-In the walls?

814
01:10:37,618 --> 01:10:38,778
Oh my gosh.

815
01:10:38,987 --> 01:10:44,289
I've been reading in the news media,
about these awful kinds of molds.

816
01:10:44,492 --> 01:10:47,723
-You should see the other patients.
-What other patients?

817
01:10:47,929 --> 01:10:49,123
Bumps all over.

818
01:10:49,330 --> 01:10:55,200
Little red bumps? You mean like
a chickenpox kind of a bump?

819
01:10:55,470 --> 01:10:58,871
There's this one
beautiful little girl...

820
01:10:59,073 --> 01:11:02,509
with skin that is
almost translucent...

821
01:11:03,378 --> 01:11:06,313
...she's allergic to clothes.
-To clothes?

822
01:11:07,048 --> 01:11:09,175
Where is he?

823
01:11:12,420 --> 01:11:16,914
I ... told Miss Silken that you'd be
here fifteen minutes ago so I ...

824
01:11:17,125 --> 01:11:20,219
-Hi, Mom.
-They should be here... Look.

825
01:11:20,461 --> 01:11:22,520
Hi. I'm Miss Silken.

826
01:11:22,730 --> 01:11:25,722
So nice to finally meet you.
Paul speaks very highly of you.

827
01:11:25,933 --> 01:11:27,833
Well, I speak very highly of him.

828
01:11:28,036 --> 01:11:29,833
You ready, kiddo?
We're almost late.

829
01:11:30,038 --> 01:11:31,733
-Sure.
-Okay.

830
01:11:32,006 --> 01:11:34,975
So, if the doctor says he's okay
he'll be back in school tomorrow.

831
01:11:35,176 --> 01:11:37,736
I'm sure he's fine.
I'll see you tomorrow.

832
01:11:37,945 --> 01:11:39,845
Bye, Miss Silken.

833
01:11:43,718 --> 01:11:46,619
I thought maybe afterwards
we could take a trip.

834
01:11:46,888 --> 01:11:50,688
-Real, or imaginary?
-Is there a difference?

835
01:11:51,426 --> 01:11:55,328
-Do I have an appointment this time?
-I told you, sweetie...

836
01:11:55,530 --> 01:11:58,055
we'll have to see if Dr. Brown
can squeeze you in.

837
01:11:59,233 --> 01:12:03,135
Why do you keep having to check?
Can't you make a real appointment?

838
01:12:08,910 --> 01:12:12,107
Now, you wait here while I check.

839
01:12:12,680 --> 01:12:15,547
I think, I'm missing too much school.

840
01:12:15,817 --> 01:12:18,081
You will be fine, trust me.

841
01:12:18,286 --> 01:12:21,881
You already know everything.
You don't even need to go to school.

842
01:12:22,323 --> 01:12:25,190
But I wanna go to school.

843
01:12:25,393 --> 01:12:27,384
I'll be right back.

844
01:12:35,136 --> 01:12:38,572
-Why couldn't Dr. Brown take me?
-Maybe next Wednesday.

845
01:12:38,773 --> 01:12:44,507
We haven't been on a roam-about
in so long. There you go. Good.

846
01:12:52,553 --> 01:12:57,081
Okay, we have Cornish Game Hen...

847
01:12:57,291 --> 01:13:00,419
chocolate milk, licorice,
ding dongs...

848
01:13:00,628 --> 01:13:03,426
radishes to dip in butter and salt,
just like you like them.

849
01:13:03,631 --> 01:13:06,532
Mom, what are we doing here?

850
01:13:07,201 --> 01:13:09,066
We're gonna go see
an ancient Indian chief...

851
01:13:09,270 --> 01:13:11,761
who knows all the secrets
of the universe.

852
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:14,940
Where're you going?

853
01:13:16,010 --> 01:13:20,674
Hello, Mom. I thought you were
supposed to take me to a doctor.

854
01:13:23,217 --> 01:13:25,685
Loverboy!

855
01:13:29,090 --> 01:13:31,718
Shit.

856
01:13:34,929 --> 01:13:36,624
Where is he?

857
01:13:37,498 --> 01:13:40,262
He's with the nurse.
He refuses to come in.

858
01:13:40,468 --> 01:13:43,494
His pants are wet.
He's... he seems very upset.

859
01:13:43,704 --> 01:13:46,172
Well, I'm not surprised.
Perhaps it 's the needles.

860
01:13:46,374 --> 01:13:49,707
-But he has to keep going.
-There is no doctor.

861
01:13:51,379 --> 01:13:53,244
Excuse me?

862
01:13:55,550 --> 01:13:58,713
What sort of nonsense is this?
My doctor...

863
01:13:59,320 --> 01:14:01,515
My son and I were
at a doctor's appointment...

864
01:14:01,722 --> 01:14:04,919
and you, Missy, are out of line.

865
01:14:05,459 --> 01:14:08,053
Why don't we come into my office?

866
01:14:12,300 --> 01:14:15,292
Whatever you feel,
you really aren't alone.

867
01:14:15,503 --> 01:14:19,405
So many mothers are having
difficulty with this transition.

868
01:14:19,874 --> 01:14:23,241
We have a buddy system here
where the fifth graders...

869
01:14:23,444 --> 01:14:26,572
buddy with the first graders
for the first few weeks of school.

870
01:14:26,781 --> 01:14:31,184
I was thinking, what about with
the moms? OId and new moms?

871
01:14:31,385 --> 01:14:34,013
I mean it 's a huge change
for everyone.

872
01:14:34,222 --> 01:14:35,780
Sure. Intriguing.

873
01:14:36,324 --> 01:14:38,952
Well maybe you can help me.
You're not working, right?

874
01:14:39,160 --> 01:14:42,755
Well I run a cell lab.
Fluorescence research, mostly.

875
01:14:42,997 --> 01:14:48,458
Really? You're a scientist.
Good for you. That must be...

876
01:14:48,869 --> 01:14:52,327
difficult being a single mom. I mean,
I hope there's a dad somewhere...

877
01:14:52,540 --> 01:14:56,032
to give you a break when you...
when you need to take a break.

878
01:14:56,244 --> 01:14:58,041
I'm not looking for breaks
from my child.

879
01:14:58,246 --> 01:15:00,180
But Paul's been handling
first grade beautifully.

880
01:15:00,381 --> 01:15:03,714
Especially considering not knowing
the other kids from kindergarten.

881
01:15:04,085 --> 01:15:05,985
I mean he's the first
to hang up his jacket.

882
01:15:06,187 --> 01:15:09,554
He likes work in the block area
or even the writer's notebook.

883
01:15:09,757 --> 01:15:11,884
-He's social...
-Excuse me, Miss Silken.

884
01:15:12,493 --> 01:15:15,018
Are you aware of Paul's
exceptional capabilities?

885
01:15:15,229 --> 01:15:19,666
-All my children are special.
-No, no, no.

886
01:15:19,867 --> 01:15:23,132
He is not just any child.

887
01:15:23,571 --> 01:15:26,631
His intelligence is remarkable.

888
01:15:26,841 --> 01:15:30,072
And his creativity is breathtaking.

889
01:15:30,278 --> 01:15:34,146
He's a hard worker and keeps up
with some of the stronger students.

890
01:15:35,349 --> 01:15:38,910
-How old are you?
-What?

891
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:41,251
I'm twenty-six.

892
01:15:41,455 --> 01:15:44,151
Well, perhaps
in your extensive studies...

893
01:15:44,358 --> 01:15:47,191
you've heard of
the educator Maria Montessori?

894
01:15:47,495 --> 01:15:52,330
It was she who said, and I believe
I am accurate in my words...

895
01:15:52,533 --> 01:15:54,592
that the conventional
classroom is a place...

896
01:15:54,802 --> 01:15:58,636
where children are like butterflies,
mounted on pins...

897
01:15:59,106 --> 01:16:00,664
fastened to their places.

898
01:16:00,875 --> 01:16:03,537
Look, this is not going anywhere.
We need to keep...

899
01:16:03,744 --> 01:16:07,145
...the focus here on Paul.
-Surely, if not Montessori, Emerson.

900
01:16:08,115 --> 01:16:10,276
You have heard of Emerson, I hope.

901
01:16:10,484 --> 01:16:13,510
He is, for all intents and purposes,
Paul's father.

902
01:16:13,854 --> 01:16:17,915
He says you will always find people
who think they know your duty...

903
01:16:18,125 --> 01:16:20,650
...better than you do.
-Ms. Stoll, please sit down.

904
01:16:20,861 --> 01:16:24,820
Excuse me. I'm sorry.
Let me use more primitive language.

905
01:16:25,700 --> 01:16:30,103
I absolutely do not,
and will never consider...

906
01:16:30,304 --> 01:16:32,898
my son with anyone else.

907
01:16:34,408 --> 01:16:38,674
I'm sorry. Despite your craving,
you may not have Paul.

908
01:16:55,162 --> 01:16:57,153
<i>Mrs. Harker</i>.

909
01:16:58,666 --> 01:17:02,796
<i>I am no longer outside her door</i>,
<i>ringing</i>...

910
01:17:03,003 --> 01:17:06,336
<i>waiting. She is here</i>...

911
01:17:06,540 --> 01:17:10,601
<i>ready to guide me to</i>
<i>where I can safely take you</i>.

912
01:17:19,453 --> 01:17:25,858
When you wake, the tooth fairy will
have a perfect new dollar for you.

913
01:17:33,267 --> 01:17:36,031
You going to sleep, too?

914
01:17:37,004 --> 01:17:38,767
Yes.

915
01:17:52,353 --> 01:17:56,050
I will always be beside you,
Loverboy.

916
01:19:33,921 --> 01:19:39,052
<i>Was there ever a mother</i>
<i>who loved her son more?</i>

917
01:19:40,628 --> 01:19:43,825
<i>Loverboy and Miss Darling</i>...

918
01:19:44,031 --> 01:19:46,625
<i>together</i>...

919
01:19:47,501 --> 01:19:49,833
<i>forever</i>.

920
01:20:09,189 --> 01:20:11,020
<i>Poof</i>...

921
01:20:11,892 --> 01:20:14,019
<i>we are gone</i>.

922
01:20:23,037 --> 01:20:29,169
Jesus. Paul? Paul?
Paul, wake up. Wake up, Paul.

923
01:20:29,376 --> 01:20:31,310
Paul, wake up. Wake up.

924
01:20:31,512 --> 01:20:36,142
Help! Help, somebody help, please!

925
01:20:36,350 --> 01:20:39,513
Help! Help! Somebody!

926
01:20:39,720 --> 01:20:42,746
Please, help! Help!

927
01:20:56,236 --> 01:20:58,704
Is this where
you guys came together?

928
01:20:58,906 --> 01:21:00,635
Yeah.

929
01:21:00,841 --> 01:21:03,401
She wasn't like the other mothers,
was she?

930
01:21:04,211 --> 01:21:06,839
<i>Long ago, giants walked the earth</i>.

931
01:21:07,047 --> 01:21:08,844
Do you miss her?

932
01:21:09,049 --> 01:21:10,346
Forever.

933
01:21:10,551 --> 01:21:13,577
<i>And when they died</i>,
<i>their bodies shrunk</i>...

934
01:21:14,054 --> 01:21:16,784
<i>but their spirits grew</i>.

935
01:21:18,225 --> 01:21:19,487
Go on.

936
01:21:19,693 --> 01:21:21,320
What do I do?

937
01:21:21,562 --> 01:21:26,192
Whisper your dreams. They'll carry
them away to where they need to go.

938
01:21:26,433 --> 01:21:28,367
Where's that?

939
01:21:29,570 --> 01:21:32,004
<i>All people are giants</i>.

940
01:21:32,940 --> 01:21:37,274
<i>They can see beyond the</i>
<i>hills, past the sky</i>...

941
01:21:37,478 --> 01:21:39,412
<i>and into forever</i>.

942
01:21:53,694 --> 01:21:55,719
Come on.

943
01:21:56,163 --> 01:21:58,597
-I'm scared.
-Remember...

944
01:21:58,866 --> 01:22:00,959
whenever you're scared...

945
01:22:01,168 --> 01:22:02,863
that means there's opportunity.

946
01:22:03,637 --> 01:22:06,401
Your mom wasn't scared, right?

947
01:22:06,607 --> 01:22:08,541
Not here.

948
01:22:38,338 --> 01:22:41,865
<i>You must never forget to imagine</i>,
<i>Loverboy</i>.

949
01:23:01,195 --> 01:23:05,359
<i>Just over there, beyond a road</i>...

950
01:23:05,566 --> 01:23:07,625
<i>beyond a tree</i>...

951
01:23:07,968 --> 01:23:10,232
<i>beyond the horizon</i>...

952
01:23:14,408 --> 01:23:17,434
<i>I am waiting for you,Paul</i>.
