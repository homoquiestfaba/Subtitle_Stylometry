1
00:00:19,574 --> 00:00:20,563
These are amazing.

2
00:00:21,776 --> 00:00:23,937
Nikki's unbiased opinion.

3
00:00:24,045 --> 00:00:26,639
I'm sorry, the little
buggers deserve to die.

4
00:00:26,748 --> 00:00:28,807
Have you even
tried the copper?

5
00:00:28,917 --> 00:00:30,441
Slugs won't cross copper.

6
00:00:31,352 --> 00:00:33,843
A giant banana slug will.
I tried it.

7
00:00:35,056 --> 00:00:36,455
I tried hot pepper spray...

8
00:00:36,558 --> 00:00:38,788
I tried insecticidal soaps...

9
00:00:38,893 --> 00:00:41,953
Hell, I even tried a bowl
sunk in the ground with...

10
00:00:42,063 --> 00:00:43,257
...beer in it.

11
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:47,165
Some creatures just don't know
what's good for their underbellies.

12
00:00:47,268 --> 00:00:49,065
Viva los tomatoes.

13
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:50,398
Exacto.

14
00:00:53,174 --> 00:00:56,109
Perhaps Max should consider
a shower before he leaves.

15
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:58,110
Is that a hint?

16
00:00:59,213 --> 00:01:03,513
Tomorrow I shall bathe in a
fresh mountain stream at dawn.

17
00:01:03,618 --> 00:01:05,085
Suit yourself.

18
00:01:05,186 --> 00:01:06,414
It's going to be freezing.

19
00:01:07,555 --> 00:01:09,045
Wish you were coming.

20
00:01:09,157 --> 00:01:10,784
No, I think I'll wait
for film at eleven.

21
00:01:13,094 --> 00:01:14,652
Well, suppose we
do run into a bear...

22
00:01:14,762 --> 00:01:17,253
or a bobcat or something, huh?

23
00:01:17,365 --> 00:01:22,598
Well, then you'll see how
fast your brother runs for cover.

24
00:01:22,704 --> 00:01:24,296
God bless him.

25
00:01:25,506 --> 00:01:26,473
-Uhhh...
-A little waxing's...

26
00:01:26,574 --> 00:01:27,734
-...good for everything.
-No!

So come on,
what do you think?

48
00:02:48,322 --> 00:02:49,619
Why are you asking me?

49
00:02:49,724 --> 00:02:51,589
'Cause, you know, you know
how to pick the winners...

50
00:02:51,693 --> 00:02:52,523
and the losers.

51
00:02:52,627 --> 00:02:54,151
Well, you know
it's going to sell.

52
00:02:54,262 --> 00:02:55,559
No, I don't know that.

53
00:02:56,397 --> 00:02:57,830
So what's the band think?

54
00:02:57,932 --> 00:03:00,025
Well, they're willing
to make it their Harry quota...

55
00:03:00,134 --> 00:03:02,295
I mean, if the label
wants it as a single.

56
00:03:02,403 --> 00:03:03,961
Well, that's good, right?

57
00:03:04,072 --> 00:03:05,369
Fuck yeah, that's good!

58
00:03:05,473 --> 00:03:07,373
It's my first single
in two albums, bro.

59
00:03:07,475 --> 00:03:08,271
Right on.

60
00:03:10,211 --> 00:03:12,873
Tell me what you think.
Honestly.

61
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:14,811
I think you should be
writing shit that's more real.

62
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:17,544
I tried that.

63
00:03:17,652 --> 00:03:19,176
You remember
'Rocket to the Moon'?

64
00:03:19,287 --> 00:03:20,845
It didn't even make
it on the album.

65
00:03:20,955 --> 00:03:23,014
I didn't even like
'Rocket to the Moon'.

66
00:03:23,124 --> 00:03:24,989
Give the little
girls what they want.

67
00:03:25,093 --> 00:03:27,561
Yeah, well, it's what I want
too, and they pay for it.

68
00:03:27,662 --> 00:03:28,856
So what's the problem?

69
00:03:30,498 --> 00:03:31,897
How far we got left anyway?

70
00:03:33,201 --> 00:03:35,465
Uhm...
maybe 20 miles.

71
00:03:36,738 --> 00:03:38,865
Fucking Shackleton.

72
00:03:38,973 --> 00:03:41,498
What's the temperature supposed
to go down to tonight?

73
00:03:41,609 --> 00:03:42,940
Did you check?

74
00:03:43,578 --> 00:03:45,011
Uhm...
we got everything we need.

75
00:03:45,113 --> 00:03:46,045
Trust me.

76
00:03:46,147 --> 00:03:47,171
You know, you're
lucky you over pack.

77
00:03:47,281 --> 00:03:48,748
I never have what I need.

78
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:49,817
Scouting...

79
00:03:50,752 --> 00:03:52,413
Never had time for it.

80
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,919
Well, you could have.

81
00:03:54,021 --> 00:03:56,216
You had time for
your rockets.

82
00:03:56,324 --> 00:03:58,849
I liked it when you took
me to fly your rockets.

83
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,655
Mom was afraid I'd maim you.

84
00:04:00,762 --> 00:04:03,322
She didn't give a fuck if
I maimed myself, though.

85
00:04:03,431 --> 00:04:04,625
But you showed me anyway.

86
00:04:25,787 --> 00:04:28,278
Well, you stopped once
the band started.

87
00:04:29,157 --> 00:04:31,318
Well, I had to, Max.
I had to practice.

88
00:04:31,425 --> 00:04:33,825
It's not like they hired my sorry
ass for its musical ability.

89
00:04:35,897 --> 00:04:37,956
I learned.
That's what counts, O.K.?

90
00:04:38,065 --> 00:04:40,499
That's open to interpretation.

91
00:04:41,903 --> 00:04:44,804
Oww. O.K., O.K.,
O.K., O.K., O.K.

92
00:04:45,773 --> 00:04:47,468
You're goddamned
right I learned!

93
00:04:47,575 --> 00:04:50,408
Big difference between
you and me, work.

94
00:04:50,511 --> 00:04:53,002
That's not the only
difference, Harold.

95
00:04:53,114 --> 00:04:54,411
I didn't say it was.

96
00:04:55,449 --> 00:04:56,279
Sorry.

97
00:04:57,485 --> 00:04:59,817
You know, you're always
apologizing for something.

98
00:05:01,889 --> 00:05:03,481
Were you displaced
when I was born?

99
00:05:03,591 --> 00:05:06,059
Oh God, what stupid book
are you reading now?

100
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,593
Nothing.
I'm just curious.

101
00:05:10,097 --> 00:05:11,257
You know, when you were born,

102
00:05:11,365 --> 00:05:12,525
I thought it was like
the greatest thing...

103
00:05:12,633 --> 00:05:13,930
to ever happen to this family.

104
00:05:14,035 --> 00:05:15,093
Yeah, right.

105
00:05:15,203 --> 00:05:16,465
Seriously.

106
00:05:16,571 --> 00:05:18,266
Can you even imagine
that kind of excitement?

107
00:05:19,574 --> 00:05:21,269
Having a little brother?

108
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:23,502
I think I was a
pain in the ass.

109
00:05:23,611 --> 00:05:25,135
Not to me you weren't.

110
00:05:25,246 --> 00:05:27,942
I think I was a
pain in the ass.

111
00:05:29,951 --> 00:05:32,112
At least you didn't throw
your shit at mom and dad.

112
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:33,346
You did that?

113
00:05:33,454 --> 00:05:34,512
Literally?

114
00:05:35,289 --> 00:05:36,313
I think so.

115
00:05:36,424 --> 00:05:37,914
I got accused of it, anyway.

116
00:05:38,025 --> 00:05:39,117
Why?

117
00:05:40,361 --> 00:05:41,726
Why'd I do it or..?

118
00:05:41,829 --> 00:05:43,763
How am I supposed
to remember?

119
00:05:44,899 --> 00:05:47,390
Well, it seems to me that
there's a number of possibilities:

120
00:05:47,501 --> 00:05:52,700
one, uhm, mom,
you aren't taking care of my shit...

121
00:05:52,807 --> 00:05:54,900
mom, you are shit...

122
00:05:55,009 --> 00:05:58,308
uh, help me,
I'm drowning in shit.

123
00:05:58,412 --> 00:06:00,744
He's a little baby,
he ain't got a lot of words,

124
00:06:00,848 --> 00:06:02,509
but he's sure got
a lot of shit.

125
00:06:04,785 --> 00:06:07,185
-The shit, that's dirty.
-You're dirty.

126
00:06:07,288 --> 00:06:09,415
You're dirty.
Dirtier and dirtier.

127
00:06:09,523 --> 00:06:11,218
-Awww...
-Dirty...

128
00:06:11,325 --> 00:06:13,316
-Bi-otch.
-Bi-otch.

129
00:06:14,262 --> 00:06:17,663
Dude, you've got to put up all
the pins before it stands up.

130
00:06:17,765 --> 00:06:19,494
Fine, then you do it.

131
00:06:26,674 --> 00:06:28,369
A two-year-old could
do this, you know.

132
00:06:28,476 --> 00:06:29,602
If you say so.

133
00:06:33,414 --> 00:06:34,312
Dinner's ready.

134
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:37,983
I thought we were supposed
to be roughing it.

135
00:06:38,085 --> 00:06:40,178
It's the Tri-Star Room.
It's the best in Burbank.

136
00:06:40,288 --> 00:06:41,186
Yeah, but I thought we
were going to cook...

137
00:06:41,289 --> 00:06:43,814
veggie burgers over the fire
and smother them in A-1.

138
00:06:43,925 --> 00:06:46,689
Why can't I buy my brother
the best dinner I can find?

139
00:06:46,794 --> 00:06:49,763
Seeing as The Alpine Tavern
closed 70 fucking years ago.

140
00:06:53,267 --> 00:06:54,894
Jesus, what did I say, Max?

141
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:57,232
Nothing, you
didn't say nothing.

142
00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:00,602
Is it the Alpine Tavern?

143
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:02,869
Because you know we're going to
go see the ruins tomorrow, right?

144
00:07:04,378 --> 00:07:06,744
Last time we had dinner was
some fancy place in New York.

145
00:07:08,349 --> 00:07:09,316
Yeah, Balthazar.

146
00:07:11,085 --> 00:07:12,382
It was supposed to
be a family dinner,

147
00:07:12,486 --> 00:07:15,785
and then it turned into this
monster thing with Roxanne...

148
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:17,983
and your label people and a bunch
of your New York friends...

149
00:07:18,092 --> 00:07:20,356
I'd never met, plus the
winner of the latest...

150
00:07:20,461 --> 00:07:22,486
fucking "Have a Date
With Harry Contest".

151
00:07:24,231 --> 00:07:25,664
I didn't even get to
talk to you that night.

152
00:07:26,667 --> 00:07:28,635
Well, it wasn't supposed
to be like that.

153
00:07:28,736 --> 00:07:30,294
Why couldn't you
just tell them no?

154
00:07:33,274 --> 00:07:34,434
If you'd have been
in town longer, Max,

155
00:07:34,542 --> 00:07:36,066
I would have had dinner
with you every night.

156
00:07:37,778 --> 00:07:39,837
I put my money where
my mouth is, didn't l?

157
00:07:39,947 --> 00:07:41,972
I came 2,000 miles
to see you, right?

158
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:42,947
I'm honored.

159
00:07:44,218 --> 00:07:46,448
I just wish that l'd
brought the "K-rations".

160
00:07:46,554 --> 00:07:47,987
K-rations?

161
00:07:48,089 --> 00:07:49,681
Yeah, did you know that
the guy that invented K-rations...

162
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:53,521
was this 82-year-old gay veteran
activist dude who just died last year?

163
00:07:53,627 --> 00:07:56,027
-Good for him.
-His name was Herb King.

164
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:58,530
He went to M.I.T.
where I want to go.

165
00:07:58,632 --> 00:08:00,998
At like a really young age
he invented this Power Bar...

166
00:08:01,102 --> 00:08:02,899
for the troops
in World War Two.

167
00:08:03,004 --> 00:08:04,335
How do you know all this?

168
00:08:04,438 --> 00:08:06,030
Modern Lifestyles class.

169
00:08:07,742 --> 00:08:09,369
You ever thought of going
back to public school?

170
00:08:10,144 --> 00:08:12,203
Fuck you, why can't l
have positive role models?

171
00:08:13,314 --> 00:08:14,781
I'm just kidding, jeez.

172
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:19,051
-Who are your role models?
-Musical or non-musical?

173
00:08:19,153 --> 00:08:21,144
I don't know,
role models in life?

174
00:08:24,225 --> 00:08:27,683
Well, dad I guess.

175
00:08:27,795 --> 00:08:29,387
Until I realized he wasn't
allowing himself...

176
00:08:29,497 --> 00:08:31,431
to do what he really wanted to do.

177
00:08:31,532 --> 00:08:33,727
Dad couldn't afford to
do what dad wanted to do.

178
00:08:33,834 --> 00:08:35,802
Yeah, well, he
let me down, Max.

179
00:08:35,903 --> 00:08:37,370
He hasn't had to worry about
money for a long time...

180
00:08:37,471 --> 00:08:38,665
and he's still not doing it.

181
00:08:40,408 --> 00:08:43,775
I mean, what is the point of
writing good stories...

182
00:08:43,878 --> 00:08:46,039
if he's not going to make
that agent work for him?

183
00:08:46,147 --> 00:08:48,411
Do you think he should have stayed
at Lockheed until the plant closed?

184
00:08:48,516 --> 00:08:50,074
Yeah, maybe he should have.

185
00:08:50,184 --> 00:08:51,811
I'm not saying I know.

186
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:53,750
But I got him that
agent for a reason.

187
00:08:53,854 --> 00:08:55,788
He'd be stupid not
to take your help.

188
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:57,380
Yeah, and he
resents me for it.

189
00:08:57,491 --> 00:08:59,220
Are you sure about that?

190
00:08:59,326 --> 00:09:00,793
Look what it did
to his self-esteem.

191
00:09:00,895 --> 00:09:02,920
He probably hates you staying
away more than anything else.

192
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:05,521
There's a reason I stay
away and they both know it.

193
00:09:05,633 --> 00:09:07,760
You've got to talk about
this shit with them, man.

194
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:11,604
It's pretty simple
from my point of view.

195
00:09:11,705 --> 00:09:12,899
Can I have some now?

196
00:09:15,576 --> 00:09:16,508
Don't get drunk.

197
00:09:23,184 --> 00:09:24,651
It's cold.

198
00:09:24,752 --> 00:09:26,879
Tell me about it, Shackleton.

199
00:09:26,987 --> 00:09:29,455
Do you think this
was a good idea?

200
00:09:29,557 --> 00:09:32,025
Of course this
was a good idea.

201
00:09:32,126 --> 00:09:33,252
This ain't Bermuda.

202
00:09:34,195 --> 00:09:34,786
No.

203
00:09:37,198 --> 00:09:39,564
Do you want to
do that again?

204
00:09:39,667 --> 00:09:41,532
What, go to Bermuda?

205
00:09:41,635 --> 00:09:43,865
No, do what we
did in Bermuda?

206
00:09:46,674 --> 00:09:49,370
We got to be a family
again in Bermuda.

207
00:09:49,477 --> 00:09:50,774
Yeah...

208
00:09:50,878 --> 00:09:52,743
It was only
two summers ago.

209
00:09:57,585 --> 00:09:59,280
I think about
it all the time.

210
00:10:02,256 --> 00:10:03,689
What?
What did I say?

211
00:10:05,693 --> 00:10:07,320
I don't know how l
feel about Bermuda.

212
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:19,228
Max.

213
00:10:21,742 --> 00:10:22,606
Max.

214
00:10:24,278 --> 00:10:25,267
Is that good?

215
00:10:25,379 --> 00:10:26,846
That's not the point.
You've got to sh...

216
00:10:27,648 --> 00:10:28,478
Show me.

217
00:10:28,582 --> 00:10:30,982
No, I'm not giving
you a blow-job.

218
00:10:31,085 --> 00:10:33,212
You've got to sheathe your
teeth, you understand?

219
00:10:46,934 --> 00:10:48,231
Am I as good as Roxanne?

220
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:51,665
Who ever said she knew
how to suck a dick?

221
00:10:57,344 --> 00:10:59,676
Don't make me feel
stupider than I already do.

222
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:05,116
You kiss better
than you suck dick?

223
00:11:05,219 --> 00:11:07,084
I've had a lot of
practice kissing.

224
00:11:07,188 --> 00:11:08,416
I'm sure you have.

225
00:11:08,522 --> 00:11:10,149
I need more practice
sucking dick.

226
00:11:10,257 --> 00:11:11,656
Well, you're not
getting it from me.

227
00:11:15,095 --> 00:11:17,723
You know, if I weren't your
brother it might be different.

228
00:11:17,831 --> 00:11:21,028
I mean, if I liked boys
and I weren't your brother.

229
00:11:21,135 --> 00:11:23,535
I mean, there's nothing
wrong with liking boys.

230
00:11:23,637 --> 00:11:24,569
It's just that...

231
00:11:25,873 --> 00:11:27,135
I like Roxanne.

232
00:11:27,241 --> 00:11:29,937
You're not sounding
very convincing.

233
00:11:40,988 --> 00:11:41,716
How's that?

234
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:44,954
-That's rad.
-Good.

235
00:11:45,059 --> 00:11:46,083
Can we go to bed now?

236
00:11:48,829 --> 00:11:53,892
Tactile contact doesn't
always have to end up in orgasm.

237
00:11:54,001 --> 00:11:55,969
What class is
that from, Max?

238
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:57,264
None.

239
00:11:57,371 --> 00:11:59,566
And who all are
you tactile with?

240
00:11:59,673 --> 00:12:00,935
Various friends.

241
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:04,968
You know, I don't
mind if you whack it.

242
00:12:06,247 --> 00:12:07,111
It's O.K.

243
00:12:07,214 --> 00:12:09,205
In fact, I'd kind of
prefer if you whacked it.

244
00:12:09,316 --> 00:12:10,613
Might help you
get some sleep.

245
00:12:12,219 --> 00:12:13,777
I can do that anytime.

246
00:12:15,122 --> 00:12:16,885
How often do I get to
sleep with my brother?

247
00:12:18,392 --> 00:12:20,223
There's nothing wrong with
sleeping together, Max.

248
00:12:34,275 --> 00:12:36,709
-Was that a bear?
-Go to bed, Max.

249
00:15:55,776 --> 00:15:59,542
Hey, you know every hotel we're
staying at in Japan has a gym?

250
00:16:00,747 --> 00:16:02,112
I think I'm going to
start working out again.

251
00:16:03,317 --> 00:16:04,511
All the gyms in the world
wouldn't make up...

252
00:16:04,618 --> 00:16:06,279
for the shit that you
put in your body.

253
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:07,782
True.

254
00:16:09,289 --> 00:16:10,813
Why don't you do yoga?

255
00:16:10,924 --> 00:16:12,949
I mean, you could do
yoga on your tour bus,

256
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:14,652
in the hotel room, wherever.

257
00:16:14,761 --> 00:16:16,922
I don't like how
it makes me feel.

258
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:18,429
How's that?

259
00:16:18,532 --> 00:16:21,933
I don't know, like I'm
coming apart at the seams.

260
00:16:22,035 --> 00:16:23,366
Come again?

261
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:25,028
Just brings a
bunch of shit up.

262
00:16:25,138 --> 00:16:26,765
Feels like it's
pulling me apart.

263
00:16:28,342 --> 00:16:30,276
Maybe that's not
such a bad thing.

264
00:16:30,377 --> 00:16:32,777
Well, maybe yoga's not for
everybody, you yoga-Nazi.

265
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,848
Maybe your body's trying
to tell you something.

266
00:16:35,549 --> 00:16:37,312
Excuse me for
coming up like this.

267
00:16:38,252 --> 00:16:40,720
I read your interview in
Teen Bopper a couple of months ago.

268
00:16:41,655 --> 00:16:42,781
Oh yeah?

269
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:44,721
It was so good...

270
00:16:44,825 --> 00:16:46,520
I can't tell you.

271
00:16:46,627 --> 00:16:48,390
I guess if they give you
a soap box to stand on,

272
00:16:48,495 --> 00:16:49,860
you stand on it, right?

273
00:16:51,098 --> 00:16:53,362
You're going to do
more music, I hope.

274
00:16:53,467 --> 00:16:54,900
I don't know.

275
00:16:55,002 --> 00:16:57,664
I mean, that first album
kind of freaked me out.

276
00:16:57,771 --> 00:17:00,467
I mean, the idea that people
actually bought it freaks me out.

277
00:17:00,574 --> 00:17:02,542
That I had to perform
it really freaks me out.

278
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:05,371
I mean, it's not
like I'm him, right?

279
00:17:05,479 --> 00:17:06,537
What's wrong with being me?

280
00:17:06,647 --> 00:17:08,080
Nothing.
That's what I'm saying.

281
00:17:08,181 --> 00:17:10,843
You're the rock
star in the family.

282
00:17:10,951 --> 00:17:13,283
I can't believe I'm
sitting here with you guys.

283
00:17:15,122 --> 00:17:17,852
I was wondering if
you could autograph...

284
00:17:24,031 --> 00:17:25,362
Best wishes...

285
00:17:27,267 --> 00:17:28,700
Max.

286
00:17:32,039 --> 00:17:33,267
That's so beautiful.

287
00:17:34,908 --> 00:17:36,603
All this used to
look like that.

288
00:17:39,713 --> 00:17:42,147
Well, enjoy your
hike back down.

289
00:17:42,249 --> 00:17:43,614
We will, thanks.

290
00:17:43,717 --> 00:17:44,684
Bye.

291
00:17:47,988 --> 00:17:48,750
Lay off.

292
00:17:50,257 --> 00:17:52,157
God, was she for
real, or what?

293
00:17:52,259 --> 00:17:54,921
What, just because no one's
interested
in your flabby ass no more?

294
00:17:55,028 --> 00:17:56,188
Yeah, well, you're
a fuckin' oddity.

295
00:17:56,296 --> 00:17:57,661
It's no wonder you
get so much attention.

296
00:17:57,764 --> 00:17:58,662
Oddity?

297
00:17:58,765 --> 00:18:00,062
Yeah, I mean,
a guy like you,

298
00:18:00,167 --> 00:18:01,600
picture in the teen mags.

299
00:18:01,702 --> 00:18:03,431
Of course you're
a fucking oddity.

300
00:18:03,537 --> 00:18:05,027
What's that
supposed to mean?

301
00:18:05,138 --> 00:18:06,765
I'm just saying, you know,
sooner or later you're gonna...

302
00:18:06,873 --> 00:18:08,864
run out of energy
for girls like that.

303
00:18:08,976 --> 00:18:10,773
Especially when
they're not sincere.

304
00:18:10,877 --> 00:18:12,811
She seemed pretty
sincere to me.

305
00:18:12,913 --> 00:18:13,777
Yeah, right.

306
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,007
A girl her age going
for a boy your age.

307
00:18:16,116 --> 00:18:18,516
You weren't complaining
when you were my age.

308
00:18:18,619 --> 00:18:20,587
What would you do if you
had to go down on her?

309
00:18:20,687 --> 00:18:22,951
Dude, she asked for my
autograph, not head.

310
00:18:23,056 --> 00:18:25,490
She wants you because she
thinks you're unspoiled.

311
00:18:25,592 --> 00:18:27,389
And she doesn't want
you hurting her.

312
00:18:27,494 --> 00:18:29,655
And most of all she
wants you clean.

313
00:18:29,763 --> 00:18:32,630
Circumcision really fucked
with your head, dude.

314
00:18:32,733 --> 00:18:34,200
Like I had any
choice about it.

315
00:18:34,301 --> 00:18:35,928
Chill out, it's not
the end of the world.

316
00:18:36,036 --> 00:18:38,596
Yeah, well, you know it's
a sore subject with me.

317
00:18:38,705 --> 00:18:40,138
You don't think I'd pay a
million fucking bucks...

318
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,605
to have my foreskin back?

319
00:18:42,876 --> 00:18:44,537
Hey, mind your own
business, bitch!

320
00:18:44,645 --> 00:18:46,237
Wait until that hits
the National Enquirer.

321
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:48,875
You wouldn't use that word
in front of mom, would you?

322
00:18:48,982 --> 00:18:51,246
Yeah, well, she is
one most of the time.

323
00:18:51,351 --> 00:18:54,616
Fucking sanctimonious,
tee-to-talitating bitch.

324
00:18:54,721 --> 00:18:56,313
Why don't we head
over this way?

325
00:18:57,824 --> 00:18:59,348
Trying to run my life too?

326
00:19:05,365 --> 00:19:07,230
You call Roxanne a bitch
when you're fucking her?

327
00:19:09,369 --> 00:19:10,768
Yeah, I call her
a bitch sometimes,

328
00:19:10,871 --> 00:19:13,066
when she needs to
be called that.

329
00:19:13,173 --> 00:19:15,107
The misogynist
rears his head.

330
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:16,835
It's a lovemaking
thing, Max.

331
00:19:16,943 --> 00:19:18,706
You gotta talk
nasty sometimes.

332
00:19:18,812 --> 00:19:20,803
What does she say
to you, Casanova?

333
00:19:20,914 --> 00:19:23,712
She says, 'You're
a bad little dog,

334
00:19:23,817 --> 00:19:25,284
and you're going to
lick my snatch until...

335
00:19:25,385 --> 00:19:28,752
I tell you you can stop,
you bad little dog'.

336
00:19:28,855 --> 00:19:29,879
And then you know
what she does?

337
00:19:30,857 --> 00:19:33,724
She wraps her legs
around my neck like this,

338
00:19:33,827 --> 00:19:36,125
and she won't let me up
until I make her come,

339
00:19:36,229 --> 00:19:38,595
and fortunately
for me I know how.

340
00:19:38,699 --> 00:19:42,635
'Lick my box, Rover.
Ahh...ahh...'

341
00:19:42,736 --> 00:19:44,294
That's what she says.

342
00:19:44,404 --> 00:19:46,634
-She calls you a dog?
-All the time.

343
00:19:48,508 --> 00:19:50,601
I'm just trying to give you
an example of how a woman...

344
00:19:50,711 --> 00:19:52,201
will behave when
she's aroused.

345
00:19:52,946 --> 00:19:54,743
I'm not sure I want
to know any more.

346
00:20:13,433 --> 00:20:14,127
Hey...

347
00:20:18,638 --> 00:20:21,368
How'd this whole thing turn
out so fucking stressful, anyway?

348
00:20:21,475 --> 00:20:23,443
Just listen to
the breeze, man.

349
00:20:23,543 --> 00:20:25,101
Let it calm you.

350
00:20:25,212 --> 00:20:29,376
Yeah, you're right.
Maybe I need some pussy.

351
00:20:29,483 --> 00:20:31,314
Medication time.

352
00:20:31,418 --> 00:20:33,648
Don't go all
12-step on me, Max.

353
00:20:33,754 --> 00:20:36,917
How come you always get with
girls that medicate you?

354
00:20:39,326 --> 00:20:40,953
You think I haven't
wondered that myself?

355
00:20:42,596 --> 00:20:45,030
Mom says that you should let
your addictions speak to you.

356
00:20:46,566 --> 00:20:48,830
You know, you're a lot like her,
despite of what you think.

357
00:20:48,935 --> 00:20:51,096
Yeah?
How's that?

358
00:20:51,204 --> 00:20:55,140
Work ethic.
You're both workaholics.

359
00:20:55,242 --> 00:20:57,437
You think could have gotten
this far by being lazy?

360
00:20:57,544 --> 00:20:58,636
No.

361
00:20:58,745 --> 00:21:01,771
But you've got to stop and
do shit for yourself, man.

362
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:04,474
It's like with Nikki...

363
00:21:05,652 --> 00:21:07,313
Does she still
live in Burbank?

364
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:08,910
Yeah.

365
00:21:09,022 --> 00:21:10,649
She's back from Boulder.

366
00:21:10,757 --> 00:21:12,850
Back from that guy that she
married and then dumped her.

367
00:21:15,662 --> 00:21:17,027
Well...

368
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:19,428
I wish she would
have called.

369
00:21:20,567 --> 00:21:21,795
Why does everyone
have to call you, man?

370
00:21:21,902 --> 00:21:23,130
Why can't you call them?

371
00:21:24,271 --> 00:21:25,260
I mean, if she
was in trouble,

372
00:21:25,372 --> 00:21:26,669
she should have called.

373
00:21:28,141 --> 00:21:30,632
It didn't help that
you had a reputation,

374
00:21:30,744 --> 00:21:33,042
a reputation for
fighting and shit.

375
00:21:33,146 --> 00:21:34,272
Once that stuff
gets printed, Max,

376
00:21:34,381 --> 00:21:36,008
you never live it down.

377
00:21:36,116 --> 00:21:37,981
Why don't you
tell her yourself?

378
00:21:38,084 --> 00:21:39,381
Tell her that
it wasn't true.

379
00:21:40,954 --> 00:21:42,717
She tends bar at
the Purple Parrot.

380
00:21:45,425 --> 00:21:48,690
I mean, with Nikki, how was
I supposed to know what was right?

381
00:21:48,795 --> 00:21:52,891
You love someone, your good
sense goes right out the window.

382
00:21:56,336 --> 00:21:57,360
I love you, man.

383
00:21:59,139 --> 00:22:00,197
You know that, right?

384
00:22:02,242 --> 00:22:03,504
Yeah.

385
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:06,135
I don't really feel like
talking about it, though.

386
00:22:06,246 --> 00:22:08,077
You saying that because of
the shit I said before...

387
00:22:08,181 --> 00:22:09,648
or because of last night?

388
00:22:09,749 --> 00:22:11,307
That was just playing
around, right?

389
00:22:11,418 --> 00:22:13,443
It didn't seem like you
were playing last night.

390
00:22:14,988 --> 00:22:16,216
I mean, how
serious can we be?

391
00:22:16,323 --> 00:22:17,847
It's not like
I can date you.

392
00:22:20,493 --> 00:22:22,120
You ever thought of
loving an older man?

393
00:22:23,797 --> 00:22:25,992
You have, haven't you?

394
00:22:26,099 --> 00:22:26,929
Huh?

395
00:22:27,033 --> 00:22:29,297
You've been with older
men, haven't you?

396
00:22:29,402 --> 00:22:32,269
I mean, excluding Bermuda.

397
00:22:32,372 --> 00:22:33,703
I don't know if
you'd say that.

398
00:22:33,807 --> 00:22:35,240
Stop being coy
and talk to me.

399
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:39,676
-Did something bad happen?
-No.

400
00:22:39,779 --> 00:22:43,215
-Did something good happen?
-I guess you could say that.

401
00:22:48,221 --> 00:22:50,621
You know who got me
into yoga, right?

402
00:22:50,724 --> 00:22:51,782
Yeah, your yoga teacher.

403
00:22:53,326 --> 00:22:54,953
Josiah Smith.

404
00:22:56,730 --> 00:22:58,061
You still see him?

405
00:22:59,332 --> 00:23:00,856
No.

406
00:23:00,967 --> 00:23:03,993
I'm surprised he didn't
offer you private lessons.

407
00:23:04,104 --> 00:23:06,129
-He left the school.
-Why, because of you?

408
00:23:07,674 --> 00:23:09,665
-I don't know.
-Yeah you do, come on.

409
00:23:09,776 --> 00:23:11,073
Well, what would the school
have said if they had found out...

410
00:23:11,177 --> 00:23:12,439
he was getting with me, huh?

411
00:23:12,545 --> 00:23:13,910
He's not allowed
to do that shit.

412
00:23:14,014 --> 00:23:15,072
Man, leave it alone.

413
00:23:17,851 --> 00:23:18,783
How old is he?

414
00:23:19,986 --> 00:23:21,715
-40.
-40?!

415
00:23:26,092 --> 00:23:28,560
This guy must know
something I don't.

416
00:23:28,662 --> 00:23:32,359
-Where's he live?
-Near Palmdale.

417
00:23:32,465 --> 00:23:34,228
He runs the Jasper
Valley Live Oak Preserve.

418
00:23:34,334 --> 00:23:36,495
Yeah, Jasper Valley...
did he stop molesting boys?

419
00:23:36,603 --> 00:23:37,797
He never did that.

420
00:23:37,904 --> 00:23:39,098
Yeah, it sucks that you
don't think there was...

421
00:23:39,205 --> 00:23:40,502
anything wrong
with what he did.

422
00:23:40,607 --> 00:23:42,199
I was the one who
started it, O.K.?

423
00:23:42,309 --> 00:23:43,469
Yeah, and he acted on it.

424
00:23:44,244 --> 00:23:45,211
He shouldn't have.

425
00:23:46,012 --> 00:23:49,971
-You did. Last night.
-That's different.

426
00:23:50,083 --> 00:23:52,108
I'm your brother, Max.

427
00:23:52,218 --> 00:23:55,312
-And 40's too old, O.K.?
-How would you know?

428
00:23:55,422 --> 00:23:56,889
Have you ever
had a male lover?

429
00:23:59,125 --> 00:24:00,490
I don't want to
talk about it.

430
00:24:00,593 --> 00:24:01,958
Then don't throw
stones, dude.

431
00:24:07,033 --> 00:24:10,400
Yeah, I've had men after me.

432
00:24:10,503 --> 00:24:11,868
Rude and lecherous men.

433
00:24:13,974 --> 00:24:15,305
Did you do shit with them?

434
00:24:16,977 --> 00:24:20,208
Sometimes I had to.
It didn't mean nothing.

435
00:24:20,313 --> 00:24:21,974
What do you mean "had to"?

436
00:24:22,082 --> 00:24:24,448
Like for work and stuff.

437
00:24:24,551 --> 00:24:28,510
Was there ever a guy that
you...really cared about?

438
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:32,983
Just find me a
fucking hotel, O.K.

439
00:25:51,771 --> 00:25:52,396
Spores...

440
00:25:54,941 --> 00:25:55,873
Spores?

441
00:25:56,910 --> 00:25:58,002
Other people's drool spores.

442
00:25:58,111 --> 00:25:59,703
You don't want
to breathe them.

443
00:25:59,813 --> 00:26:01,337
They nest in the filling.

444
00:26:01,448 --> 00:26:02,779
-Thanks.
-Sure.

445
00:26:05,151 --> 00:26:06,345
That's better, right?

446
00:26:08,721 --> 00:26:11,747
Yeah, you're like the
perfect little wi...

447
00:26:11,858 --> 00:26:13,519
travelling companion.

448
00:26:13,626 --> 00:26:15,753
You were about
to say 'wife'.

449
00:26:15,862 --> 00:26:18,456
-No, no I wasn't.
-Yeah, you were!

450
00:26:18,565 --> 00:26:20,294
-No I wasn't.
-Yeah you were!

451
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,162
No...

452
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:27,337
-Want to smoke some pot?
-No.

453
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,136
-ls it O.K. if I do?
-Sure.

454
00:26:53,566 --> 00:26:55,431
-You don't like pot?
-No.

455
00:26:56,436 --> 00:26:58,028
Drunks don't like pot.

456
00:26:58,138 --> 00:27:00,572
I can't speak for
other drunks, Max.

457
00:27:02,408 --> 00:27:03,602
We had pot in Bermuda.

458
00:27:05,378 --> 00:27:08,506
I just like being naked like
that on the beach and all.

459
00:27:08,615 --> 00:27:10,640
Yeah, well, this ain't Bermuda.

460
00:27:12,051 --> 00:27:14,042
Besides, I can't do
that shit anymore.

461
00:27:14,154 --> 00:27:16,588
Somebody's going to take a
picture of me all fat and shit.

462
00:27:16,689 --> 00:27:18,657
I'm sorry I called
you fat before.

463
00:27:18,758 --> 00:27:20,555
I am kind of fat.

464
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:21,752
No you're not, man.

465
00:27:23,263 --> 00:27:24,093
No?

466
00:27:31,471 --> 00:27:32,836
Do you want to sleep
in my bed tonight?

467
00:27:36,743 --> 00:27:39,268
It's like you're a different
person than when you were little.

468
00:27:39,379 --> 00:27:41,404
I mean, don't get me wrong.
That's a good thing.

469
00:27:44,517 --> 00:27:46,576
It's no big deal if we
sleep in the same bed.

470
00:27:49,989 --> 00:27:52,549
It would be like the worst thing
that could ever happen to me, you
know?

471
00:27:52,659 --> 00:27:54,217
Somebody found out about us?

472
00:27:55,695 --> 00:27:57,458
It wouldn't be that
great for me either.

473
00:27:57,564 --> 00:27:58,963
Yeah, it wouldn't
matter for you.

474
00:27:59,065 --> 00:28:00,930
Nobody's going to
stop liking 'Max'.

475
00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:06,598
So when did you first
want it, anyway?

476
00:28:06,706 --> 00:28:08,264
-With you?
-Yeah.

477
00:28:09,442 --> 00:28:11,171
When I was like 7.

478
00:28:12,812 --> 00:28:14,439
You're kidding, right?

479
00:28:19,552 --> 00:28:23,044
There was this one Saturday
morning and we were both in bed.

480
00:28:23,156 --> 00:28:24,953
The dog was scratching
at the door to get in...

481
00:28:25,058 --> 00:28:27,390
and making a lot of noise.

482
00:28:27,493 --> 00:28:30,360
I pretended not to hear him.

483
00:28:30,463 --> 00:28:33,762
You got out of bed with no
clothes on and had this big boner...

484
00:28:35,301 --> 00:28:36,393
I wanted to check it out.

485
00:28:37,737 --> 00:28:39,034
God.

486
00:28:39,138 --> 00:28:41,629
Now I feel guilty
for making you gay.

487
00:28:41,741 --> 00:28:43,106
I already knew
what I wanted.

488
00:28:43,209 --> 00:28:45,370
-When you were 7?
-Yep.

489
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:48,312
I had no clue.

490
00:28:49,382 --> 00:28:50,679
You don't remember?

491
00:28:50,783 --> 00:28:52,717
I showed you my
boner after that.

492
00:28:52,819 --> 00:28:54,684
Dude, you were always
walking around naked.

493
00:28:54,787 --> 00:28:57,449
It didn't faze me,
it wasn't sexual.

494
00:28:57,557 --> 00:28:58,683
It was sexual.

495
00:28:59,859 --> 00:29:01,417
I wanted you to touch it.

496
00:29:01,527 --> 00:29:03,427
Yeah, well, that definitely
was not going to happen.

497
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:09,333
You know you could have
had me whenever you wanted.

498
00:29:09,435 --> 00:29:11,630
That's why it eventually
happened in Bermuda.

499
00:29:13,906 --> 00:29:15,339
Like I gave you permission.

500
00:29:50,843 --> 00:29:53,368
-Hey, waddup?
-Where are you?

501
00:29:53,479 --> 00:29:55,504
I'm at some dump at the
base of the mountain.

502
00:29:55,615 --> 00:29:57,981
-How's camping?
-lt got too cold.

503
00:29:58,084 --> 00:29:59,381
We're leaving
tomorrow, though.

504
00:29:59,485 --> 00:30:02,511
All right, you think I could
call you back another time?

505
00:30:02,622 --> 00:30:06,058
-Yeah, as in later tonight?
-Uh, how about tomorrow?

506
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:08,354
-Where are you?
-We're at Galapagos.

507
00:30:08,461 --> 00:30:09,792
We just finished dinner.

508
00:30:09,896 --> 00:30:11,887
-I miss Galapagos.
-Then get the fuck home.

509
00:30:11,998 --> 00:30:12,657
I gotta go.

510
00:30:12,765 --> 00:30:13,823
Hey...

511
00:30:13,933 --> 00:30:15,059
I'm leaving
Wednesday, you know?

512
00:30:15,168 --> 00:30:17,693
I know...Iove ya.
-Yeah...

513
00:30:17,804 --> 00:30:21,501
What the fuck?
Love you too.

514
00:30:29,015 --> 00:30:30,880
Come on, let me
drive for a while.

515
00:30:30,983 --> 00:30:32,280
-Nope.
-Yes.

516
00:30:32,385 --> 00:30:33,545
-Nope.
-Yes.

517
00:30:33,653 --> 00:30:34,950
-Nope.
-Yes.

518
00:30:36,289 --> 00:30:37,722
-Nope.
-Yes.

519
00:30:38,491 --> 00:30:39,958
Not a mile over the limit.

520
00:30:40,059 --> 00:30:41,458
-Bi-otch.
-Bi-otch.

521
00:31:02,749 --> 00:31:04,182
I'm not asleep, you know.

522
00:31:10,456 --> 00:31:12,583
Just concentrate
on driving, Max.

523
00:31:16,662 --> 00:31:19,130
-You liked it, right?
-It's all good.

524
00:31:21,467 --> 00:31:22,866
I just don't want to die.

525
00:31:37,116 --> 00:31:39,346
Didn't you say that yoga
guy lives near Palmdale?

526
00:31:40,553 --> 00:31:41,520
Yeah, you want to turn off?

527
00:31:42,989 --> 00:31:43,853
Not now.

528
00:31:44,757 --> 00:31:45,917
I'm sure he'd
love to meet you.

529
00:31:47,293 --> 00:31:48,487
Another time, Max.

530
00:31:51,564 --> 00:31:54,192
? You are my all. ?

531
00:31:54,300 --> 00:32:02,298
? Always take care.
I can look but I can't stare. ?

532
00:32:02,408 --> 00:32:07,505
? And there are times,
when I am low ?

533
00:32:07,613 --> 00:32:11,982
? I think of you girl.
I want you to know. ?

534
00:32:12,084 --> 00:32:16,885
? The better one,
Just holding on. ?

535
00:32:16,989 --> 00:32:26,591
? I watch your garden grow so
strong.
Hmmm... ?

536
00:32:31,037 --> 00:32:32,470
Party at the hotel?
Tuesday?

537
00:32:32,572 --> 00:32:33,129
We'll see.

538
00:32:34,507 --> 00:32:35,701
Can I bring Nikki?

539
00:32:35,808 --> 00:32:37,742
Tsss...
Get out of here.

540
00:35:13,065 --> 00:35:14,054
-Hi.
-Hey.

541
00:35:17,970 --> 00:35:19,130
How are you doing?

542
00:35:19,238 --> 00:35:20,227
Man, you're
falling apart here.

543
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:23,405
Are you going to
visit him in Japan?

544
00:35:23,509 --> 00:35:24,999
Mom thinks that I should stay here...

545
00:35:25,111 --> 00:35:27,579
with all the stuff that
I've got going on this summer.

546
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,910
No, Japan would
be great for you.

547
00:35:30,449 --> 00:35:32,815
God, can't she see that?

548
00:35:32,918 --> 00:35:35,910
Maybe we could go somewhere
this summer, you and me.

549
00:35:36,022 --> 00:35:38,923
Maybe somewhere
closer than Japan.

550
00:35:39,025 --> 00:35:40,515
Like San Diego.

551
00:35:40,626 --> 00:35:42,423
We could see
the panda bears.

552
00:35:42,528 --> 00:35:45,725
That's so fucking warped,
panda bears in San Diego,

553
00:35:45,831 --> 00:35:47,128
a hundred degrees out?

554
00:35:47,233 --> 00:35:49,360
But they're so cute with
their little markings...

555
00:35:49,468 --> 00:35:51,265
and their little noses.

556
00:35:51,370 --> 00:35:53,235
Yeah, like little
teen idols.

557
00:35:56,776 --> 00:35:58,073
I'm sorry.

558
00:35:58,177 --> 00:35:59,667
I couldn't resist.

559
00:36:01,247 --> 00:36:02,976
So how's he doing, Max?

560
00:36:03,082 --> 00:36:04,413
Is he happy?

561
00:36:07,953 --> 00:36:09,580
The band's at each
other's throats.

562
00:36:11,257 --> 00:36:12,349
It's like if
their album sells,

563
00:36:12,458 --> 00:36:13,948
then everyone forgets for
a little while longer...

564
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:15,618
just how badly they want out.

565
00:36:34,113 --> 00:36:35,774
-Josiah?
-Yeah?

566
00:36:35,881 --> 00:36:38,543
Hey.
I'm Harry.

567
00:36:38,651 --> 00:36:40,243
I'm Max's brother.

568
00:36:40,352 --> 00:36:42,547
Yeah, I know, hi.

569
00:36:42,655 --> 00:36:44,145
-New hair.
-Always.

570
00:36:45,725 --> 00:36:48,353
-Is he O.K.?
-Yeah, yeah he's fine.

571
00:36:49,495 --> 00:36:50,860
I'm glad.

572
00:36:50,963 --> 00:36:52,521
So where are all
these live oaks...

573
00:36:52,631 --> 00:36:54,496
I've been hearing so much about?

574
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,227
He loves them
live oaks, Max.

575
00:36:58,404 --> 00:37:02,431
So index on the second fret,
or the second dotted part...

576
00:37:02,541 --> 00:37:02,905
-Right.
-'A'...

577
00:37:03,008 --> 00:37:03,997
-That one?
-Yeah.

578
00:37:05,377 --> 00:37:08,073
Then the middle finger,
third string up, and the...

579
00:37:09,548 --> 00:37:10,515
other two right above it.

580
00:37:12,718 --> 00:37:13,582
-Like that?
-Yeah.

581
00:37:16,422 --> 00:37:18,049
-Ooh...almost.
-That was close.

582
00:37:20,326 --> 00:37:22,157
-No, it's no use.
-O.K.

583
00:37:22,261 --> 00:37:23,660
Look, why don't l
just write some words.

584
00:37:23,763 --> 00:37:24,559
-Sure.
-O.K.

585
00:37:28,734 --> 00:37:33,194
? Sittin' in Nikki's apartment
while I learn to play the guitar... ?

586
00:37:33,305 --> 00:37:34,237
What are you..?

587
00:37:36,542 --> 00:37:37,474
I was watching
the E Channel.

588
00:37:37,576 --> 00:37:39,601
-You ever watch E?
-Sometimes.

589
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:42,579
They had this piece about
you and your management company,

590
00:37:42,681 --> 00:37:43,841
something about bad blood.

591
00:37:43,949 --> 00:37:44,779
Oh yeah?

592
00:37:44,884 --> 00:37:47,182
Yeah, how did they put it?
It was really funny.

593
00:37:47,286 --> 00:37:49,049
'The last couple of years
you've spent more time...

594
00:37:49,155 --> 00:37:53,216
suing people in court than Raymond
Burr in the entirety of his career.'

595
00:37:53,325 --> 00:37:55,293
A guy like me has to
watch out for himself.

596
00:37:55,394 --> 00:37:56,952
The music business
is in the shitter,

597
00:37:57,062 --> 00:37:58,461
in case you didn't know.

598
00:37:59,398 --> 00:38:00,330
Yeah, I heard.

599
00:38:03,969 --> 00:38:05,402
So...

600
00:38:05,504 --> 00:38:08,234
to what do I owe
this visit, Mr. Burr?

601
00:38:10,075 --> 00:38:13,567
Well, Josiah, I was hoping
you could straighten me out.

602
00:38:15,514 --> 00:38:17,675
-Straighten you out?
-Yeah.

603
00:38:17,783 --> 00:38:19,808
I mean, I'm conflicted.

604
00:38:19,919 --> 00:38:22,012
I thought I might turn
to you for advice.

605
00:38:28,961 --> 00:38:29,723
Nice.

606
00:38:33,165 --> 00:38:35,326
-I don't blame him.
-For what?

607
00:38:36,936 --> 00:38:38,267
Loving you.

608
00:38:40,472 --> 00:38:42,099
-Like he still does.
-Fuck you.

609
00:38:45,811 --> 00:38:47,210
I've seen it
with my own eyes.

610
00:38:47,313 --> 00:38:49,975
-Seen what?
-His regret.

611
00:38:54,887 --> 00:38:55,717
Think about Max.

612
00:38:58,190 --> 00:38:59,851
What does he need
from you right now?

613
00:39:02,595 --> 00:39:04,290
Does he need a
sexual relationship?

614
00:39:05,631 --> 00:39:07,121
If I were you l'd
be asking myself why...

615
00:39:07,233 --> 00:39:09,064
I'm looking to him for that.

616
00:39:09,168 --> 00:39:10,931
Maybe you could talk to him.

617
00:39:11,036 --> 00:39:12,401
For what purpose?

618
00:39:12,504 --> 00:39:15,302
To find out how he feels,
to see if he wants me...

619
00:39:15,407 --> 00:39:16,806
the same way I want him.

620
00:39:17,977 --> 00:39:20,104
And what makes you
think he'll tell me?

621
00:39:20,212 --> 00:39:22,874
Might take the pressure off,
third party and all.

622
00:39:22,982 --> 00:39:25,109
Max and I have
boundaries at this point.

623
00:39:25,217 --> 00:39:26,946
Do you understand
why that's important?

624
00:39:27,052 --> 00:39:27,916
No.

625
00:39:29,188 --> 00:39:32,817
The way I see it,
we're in this together.

626
00:39:32,925 --> 00:39:36,224
We both love Max and we both
want what's best for him.

627
00:39:36,328 --> 00:39:37,625
It doesn't sound like it.

628
00:39:46,705 --> 00:39:47,694
We can't go there.

629
00:39:50,042 --> 00:39:51,634
-I love you.
-I know.

630
00:39:52,878 --> 00:39:53,936
I love you too.

631
00:39:55,447 --> 00:39:57,745
-That's O.K., right?
-Yeah, that's O.K.

632
00:40:03,489 --> 00:40:04,513
Is that O.K.?

633
00:41:15,327 --> 00:41:16,589
You like vodka, Josiah?

634
00:41:17,663 --> 00:41:18,357
I'm O.K.

635
00:41:30,509 --> 00:41:33,205
Man, you're strong.

636
00:41:33,312 --> 00:41:35,473
I wish I had
muscles like yours.

637
00:41:43,922 --> 00:41:45,856
Jesus Fucking Christ!

638
00:41:45,958 --> 00:41:47,619
Jesus Fucking Christ what?

639
00:41:49,161 --> 00:41:51,061
Just Jesus Fucking Christ.

640
00:41:51,163 --> 00:41:51,959
You don't mind, do you?

641
00:41:53,098 --> 00:41:55,396
Your heart's
beating real fast.

642
00:41:55,501 --> 00:41:57,128
Yeah, no kidding.

643
00:42:00,039 --> 00:42:01,233
I want to know
what Max felt.

644
00:42:05,177 --> 00:42:07,304
And one thing I've
learned, Josiah,

645
00:42:07,413 --> 00:42:12,680
is to never delay gratification
if I can possibly avoid it.

646
00:42:15,954 --> 00:42:17,046
What do you want me to do?

647
00:42:18,991 --> 00:42:21,152
Pretend I'm Max.

648
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:23,160
Do to me what
you did to Max.

649
00:42:25,297 --> 00:42:26,286
Turn around.

650
00:42:44,149 --> 00:42:45,741
Would it be
better if I left?

651
00:42:49,688 --> 00:42:50,814
Would you mind?

652
00:43:02,901 --> 00:43:04,528
You working at the
Parrot tonight?

653
00:43:04,636 --> 00:43:06,103
Yeah.

654
00:43:06,205 --> 00:43:08,469
You know this has nothing
to do with you, right?

655
00:43:11,777 --> 00:43:13,108
Is there anything I can do?

656
00:43:13,212 --> 00:43:14,201
No, no.

657
00:43:14,313 --> 00:43:15,302
I had a really
great time today.

658
00:43:15,414 --> 00:43:16,847
Thank you.

659
00:44:12,437 --> 00:44:13,870
How does it feel to
be straightened out?

660
00:44:13,972 --> 00:44:14,529
Fuck you.

661
00:44:18,277 --> 00:44:19,744
How could you leave
him high and dry?

662
00:44:20,979 --> 00:44:23,004
You may not realize this,
but Max and I saw each other...

663
00:44:23,115 --> 00:44:25,083
constantly for 6 months.

664
00:44:25,184 --> 00:44:27,448
Yeah, and then you packed up
and shipped out.

665
00:44:27,553 --> 00:44:29,350
Max had nothing
to do with that.

666
00:44:29,454 --> 00:44:30,819
Did you bother to
let him know that?

667
00:44:30,923 --> 00:44:32,185
Yeah.

668
00:44:32,291 --> 00:44:33,952
And how do you
think he took it?

669
00:44:34,059 --> 00:44:35,526
He seemed O.K.

670
00:44:35,627 --> 00:44:39,563
Yeah, well, the things
Max feels the most,

671
00:44:39,665 --> 00:44:40,632
he doesn't say them.

672
00:44:40,732 --> 00:44:41,858
Not to anybody.

673
00:44:43,302 --> 00:44:44,599
How can I say this?

674
00:44:46,505 --> 00:44:50,805
Our love was irrelevant
on any sustainable basis.

675
00:44:50,909 --> 00:44:53,002
Max pre-empted it
himself in the end.

676
00:44:53,111 --> 00:44:55,375
You were very
relevant to him.

677
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:57,539
Max is heading
somewhere I can't go.

678
00:44:57,649 --> 00:44:59,776
He has to find out where.
I can't show him.

679
00:44:59,885 --> 00:45:01,580
You can't show him.
No one can.

680
00:45:08,493 --> 00:45:10,256
I know that whenever
I'm with Max,

681
00:45:10,362 --> 00:45:13,490
I feel like it's all going
to be O.K., you know?

682
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:15,464
Like he's the most
real thing in my life.

683
00:45:15,567 --> 00:45:19,469
That's you!
What about him? Jeez!

684
00:45:19,571 --> 00:45:23,337
What your brother needs now is
support
for what he's doing in the world.

685
00:45:23,442 --> 00:45:25,205
I think he gets
lots of support.

686
00:45:25,310 --> 00:45:26,834
From Nikki?

687
00:45:26,945 --> 00:45:29,243
How do you know about Nikki?

688
00:45:29,348 --> 00:45:31,578
Same way you know
about me, come on.

689
00:45:31,683 --> 00:45:33,241
Such a soap opera!

690
00:45:35,787 --> 00:45:38,187
You know, they're a lot
alike, Max and Nikki.

691
00:45:38,290 --> 00:45:40,281
A lot alike.

692
00:45:40,392 --> 00:45:42,690
Maybe what you're
looking for in Max,

693
00:45:42,794 --> 00:45:45,058
maybe what you're really
looking for is Nikki.

694
00:46:27,706 --> 00:46:29,037
You know, only Max would
think of camping...

695
00:46:29,141 --> 00:46:30,972
practically in the middle
of fucking winter.

696
00:46:32,811 --> 00:46:33,539
Yeah.

697
00:46:33,645 --> 00:46:35,579
Max just says yes to
life all the time.

698
00:46:37,149 --> 00:46:38,514
What?

699
00:46:38,617 --> 00:46:39,982
What's that for?

700
00:46:40,085 --> 00:46:42,576
You know how long he's been
waiting
for this camping trip you promised.

701
00:46:43,755 --> 00:46:45,313
Why are you on my
case about Max?

702
00:46:46,558 --> 00:46:47,616
I don't know.

703
00:46:51,029 --> 00:46:52,360
It's been a long time
since I've seen you.

704
00:46:52,464 --> 00:46:54,329
I guess I'm surprised
you're here.

705
00:46:54,433 --> 00:46:55,764
You're not glad I came?

706
00:47:15,253 --> 00:47:17,687
Nikki, I was hoping that
you'd give me a chance...

707
00:47:17,789 --> 00:47:19,313
to be your friend again.

708
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:24,028
You were incapable
of being my friend.

709
00:47:24,129 --> 00:47:25,687
I got on with my life.

710
00:47:25,797 --> 00:47:26,957
I think it's vain of you
to think I'd be...

711
00:47:27,065 --> 00:47:28,657
into you at this point.

712
00:47:31,303 --> 00:47:32,827
I guess you don't beat
around the bush, huh?

713
00:47:55,894 --> 00:47:58,624
That's your idea of a
fulfilling relationship?

714
00:47:58,730 --> 00:47:59,924
Dating Roxanne?

715
00:48:00,465 --> 00:48:03,866
She makes me feel like
less of a fraud, I guess.

716
00:48:03,969 --> 00:48:06,529
Maybe because
she's such a fraud.

717
00:48:06,638 --> 00:48:08,196
I think you're going to have
to work really hard to...

718
00:48:08,306 --> 00:48:12,800
make yourself appealing, and I don't
think you've even begun to do it.

719
00:48:12,911 --> 00:48:14,003
I think I've tried.

720
00:48:15,447 --> 00:48:19,042
But you're also a drunk with
no urge to address his own demons.

721
00:48:19,151 --> 00:48:21,051
I address them
every day, thanks.

722
00:48:21,153 --> 00:48:22,586
O.K., yeah,
you're functional.

723
00:48:22,687 --> 00:48:23,813
Usually.

724
00:48:23,922 --> 00:48:26,220
-Yeah, give me credit for that.
-O.K.

725
00:48:27,459 --> 00:48:29,324
You're functional.

726
00:48:29,428 --> 00:48:31,555
My uncle died of
cirrhosis of the liver.

727
00:48:31,663 --> 00:48:33,688
It wasn't pretty but
he was functional.

728
00:49:01,493 --> 00:49:02,517
So...

729
00:49:05,263 --> 00:49:06,958
What kind of guy are after?

730
00:49:07,065 --> 00:49:08,327
I mean, if you were
looking for a guy?

731
00:49:08,433 --> 00:49:09,900
I already told you, I'm not.

732
00:49:10,001 --> 00:49:10,660
If you were?

733
00:49:15,474 --> 00:49:16,873
Can I ask you a
personal question?

734
00:49:19,478 --> 00:49:21,207
Have you been with Max?

735
00:49:21,313 --> 00:49:23,304
Have I been with him?
No.

736
00:49:24,950 --> 00:49:26,440
Yeah, but you've
thought about it, right?

737
00:49:28,587 --> 00:49:30,452
Look, even if l
wanted to, I couldn't.

738
00:49:31,523 --> 00:49:32,717
Why not?

739
00:49:32,824 --> 00:49:35,520
He trusts you, he adores you.

740
00:49:35,627 --> 00:49:37,618
That's exactly
why I couldn't.

741
00:49:42,267 --> 00:49:44,258
You don't think
he desires you?

742
00:49:44,369 --> 00:49:46,462
No, I don't.

743
00:49:46,571 --> 00:49:48,436
I think he feels the
same way I do about him.

744
00:49:50,942 --> 00:49:52,603
You don't know what
you're missing.

745
00:49:52,711 --> 00:49:54,201
What's that mean?

746
00:49:56,882 --> 00:50:00,409
Well, you said it yourself.
He's a hottie.

747
00:50:00,519 --> 00:50:03,181
I mean, he may be small but the
kid shoots like a firehose.

748
00:50:04,756 --> 00:50:06,587
And I'm supposed to ask
you how you know that?

749
00:50:08,226 --> 00:50:10,786
Let's just say I've
had a front-row seat.

750
00:50:10,896 --> 00:50:12,659
No, no, more than that.

751
00:50:12,764 --> 00:50:16,165
Let's just say I've had
my mouth around him...

752
00:50:16,268 --> 00:50:18,395
and he's had his
mouth around me.

753
00:50:18,503 --> 00:50:20,528
No, no, more than that.

754
00:50:21,940 --> 00:50:23,931
Let's just say he's
been inside of me,

755
00:50:24,042 --> 00:50:25,304
and I fucking love him.

756
00:50:25,410 --> 00:50:26,434
That is so creepy.

757
00:50:26,545 --> 00:50:28,308
I just don't see the
difference between...

758
00:50:28,413 --> 00:50:30,142
you getting with him or
me getting with him.

759
00:50:30,248 --> 00:50:31,340
There's a word
for it, Harry.

760
00:50:31,449 --> 00:50:32,416
Incest.

761
00:50:32,517 --> 00:50:34,109
I mean, if you don't
want to use it, I will.

762
00:50:34,219 --> 00:50:36,346
Don't talk to me about
things you don't understand.

763
00:50:36,454 --> 00:50:38,115
What do you call
fucking your brother?

764
00:50:38,223 --> 00:50:39,690
We're not fucking!

765
00:50:39,791 --> 00:50:41,224
We're helping each
other work shit out.

766
00:50:43,361 --> 00:50:44,988
Man, you never had
any boundaries.

767
00:50:45,096 --> 00:50:46,120
Boundaries are overrated.

768
00:50:46,231 --> 00:50:47,357
-Don't!
-Why not?

769
00:50:48,233 --> 00:50:50,360
Is there anything I can do
to make you change your mind?

770
00:50:50,468 --> 00:50:51,696
No.
No, there isn't.

771
00:50:51,803 --> 00:50:52,997
Just drink up and leave.

772
00:51:02,914 --> 00:51:10,252
? And she turns her way homeward,
with one star awake. ?

773
00:51:10,355 --> 00:51:16,885
? Like a swan in the evening
moves over the lake. ?

774
00:51:37,549 --> 00:51:38,675
Hey, this is Roxy.

775
00:51:38,783 --> 00:51:40,648
Sorry, can't get to
the phone right now.

776
00:51:40,752 --> 00:51:41,411
Please leave a...

777
00:51:45,757 --> 00:51:47,315
Well, just leave her a note.

778
00:51:47,425 --> 00:51:49,950
Tell her you went to see
the sunrise over the desert.

779
00:51:50,061 --> 00:51:52,256
How'd I get there,
on my fucking ATV?

780
00:51:52,364 --> 00:51:54,798
-I'll take care of mom.
-Don't.

781
00:51:54,899 --> 00:51:56,764
Don't do it, man.
Don't manipulate her.

782
00:51:56,868 --> 00:52:00,167
I just want you
here with me.

783
00:52:00,271 --> 00:52:01,966
You're not even sober.

784
00:52:02,073 --> 00:52:03,700
What does that have
to do with anything?

785
00:52:03,808 --> 00:52:05,241
It has everything
to do with it.

786
00:52:06,711 --> 00:52:08,303
I just want you
here with me, bro.

787
00:52:12,317 --> 00:52:13,181
Call me a cab.

788
00:52:29,768 --> 00:52:30,496
Harry?

789
00:52:47,852 --> 00:52:48,546
Yo.

790
00:52:59,664 --> 00:53:00,926
You had a shower or a swim?

791
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:02,992
A swimmy.

792
00:53:10,442 --> 00:53:11,101
Lie down.

793
00:53:24,622 --> 00:53:26,749
-You O.K.?
-Uh-hum.

794
00:53:31,529 --> 00:53:32,928
You're kind of
freaking me out.

795
00:53:33,031 --> 00:53:33,929
How come?

796
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:37,727
-Are you on drugs?
-No.

797
00:53:43,875 --> 00:53:46,605
-I love you, man.
-I love you too.

798
00:53:50,648 --> 00:53:52,878
I don't really feel like
making out right now.

799
00:54:01,493 --> 00:54:02,482
Did Nikki call you?

800
00:54:05,563 --> 00:54:06,825
I was there, dude.

801
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:09,831
You were where, dude?

802
00:54:10,769 --> 00:54:12,293
I was at the Purple Parrot?

803
00:54:13,271 --> 00:54:14,431
Where?

804
00:54:14,539 --> 00:54:16,530
On the balcony
above the bar.

805
00:54:17,876 --> 00:54:19,605
"On the balcony
above the bar."

806
00:54:21,746 --> 00:54:24,180
Sounds like a bad
romance novel.

807
00:54:24,282 --> 00:54:25,749
Is that what we
are now, Max?

808
00:54:27,252 --> 00:54:29,083
Why'd you have to tell
her that shit, man?

809
00:54:29,187 --> 00:54:31,348
You're so fucking
irresponsible.

810
00:54:32,590 --> 00:54:35,058
Didn't you even think about how
weird it was going to make it for me?

811
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:37,685
Oh, for what?
All of like 5 minutes?

812
00:54:37,796 --> 00:54:38,922
The next thing you know,
you're going to be back...

813
00:54:39,030 --> 00:54:40,827
reading poetry in
each other's arms.

814
00:54:42,734 --> 00:54:45,328
It's not smart to fuck
with her heart, man.

815
00:54:45,436 --> 00:54:46,698
Or my heart.

816
00:54:48,907 --> 00:54:52,604
I'm being out in the open.
I want you.

817
00:54:52,710 --> 00:54:55,076
A couple of hours
ago you wanted Nikki.

818
00:54:57,182 --> 00:54:58,911
You need to get
a fucking life.

819
00:55:11,229 --> 00:55:13,356
I didn't, I didn't
mean that totally.

820
00:55:13,464 --> 00:55:14,396
Yeah, whatever.

821
00:55:16,634 --> 00:55:18,226
She surprised me tonight.

822
00:55:18,336 --> 00:55:20,634
What did you expect her
to do, jump up and down?

823
00:55:23,007 --> 00:55:24,372
That's not what I meant.

824
00:55:24,475 --> 00:55:26,170
You were thinking she'd leap
back into my arms and say,

825
00:55:26,277 --> 00:55:28,507
"Harry, come back to me"?

826
00:55:28,613 --> 00:55:30,080
I don't know
what I expected.

827
00:55:34,085 --> 00:55:36,019
Is there something you
wanted her to tell me?

828
00:55:38,256 --> 00:55:39,052
Humh?

829
00:55:41,726 --> 00:55:42,784
Tell me about Josiah.

830
00:55:42,894 --> 00:55:44,088
Are you going to
see him again?

831
00:55:46,331 --> 00:55:48,458
-Probably not.
-How come?

832
00:55:48,566 --> 00:55:49,965
He seems like a
nice enough guy.

833
00:55:50,969 --> 00:55:53,904
-You talked to him.
-Yeah.

834
00:55:54,005 --> 00:55:56,098
Well, that's so
embarrassing.

835
00:55:56,207 --> 00:55:57,105
Why?

836
00:55:57,208 --> 00:55:59,267
Well, it's embarrassing that
I even got with the guy.

837
00:55:59,377 --> 00:56:01,072
I don't see what's so
embarrassing about it.

838
00:56:01,179 --> 00:56:03,272
It's embarrassing because
now someone knows.

839
00:56:03,381 --> 00:56:05,076
I mean, it used to
be just him and me.

840
00:56:05,183 --> 00:56:07,617
Hey, I don't think
any less of you, Max.

841
00:56:07,719 --> 00:56:10,813
I mean, it's like now
all of a sudden it's real.

842
00:56:10,922 --> 00:56:13,220
Whereas before it
was just a secret.

843
00:56:13,324 --> 00:56:14,916
We got no secrets,
you and me.

844
00:56:16,527 --> 00:56:18,188
Except you and me.

845
00:56:18,296 --> 00:56:20,093
We're only the
biggest secret of all.

846
00:56:22,066 --> 00:56:23,795
Some things have
to stay private.

847
00:56:25,470 --> 00:56:27,734
Like you're an expert at
keeping your mouth shut.

848
00:56:29,774 --> 00:56:32,436
Now I have to explain to
both Nikki and Josiah.

849
00:56:32,543 --> 00:56:33,601
Oh no!

850
00:56:33,711 --> 00:56:35,303
Max, you're getting
a reputation.

851
00:56:35,413 --> 00:56:36,311
It's not funny.

852
00:56:37,515 --> 00:56:41,417
It's like I could never bring
Josiah home to mom and dad.

853
00:56:41,519 --> 00:56:42,986
Not that I'd ever want
to bring him home.

854
00:56:43,087 --> 00:56:46,716
He's a great guy, but I don't
want to bring anyone home.

855
00:56:47,926 --> 00:56:50,053
-What are you so afraid of?
-Nothing.

856
00:56:51,462 --> 00:56:52,929
I'm not afraid of nothing.

857
00:56:54,766 --> 00:56:56,358
I don't like what you did.

858
00:57:13,718 --> 00:57:15,083
You like staying
up all night?

859
00:57:16,688 --> 00:57:17,552
Not really.

860
00:57:19,223 --> 00:57:20,190
Oh man.

861
00:57:20,291 --> 00:57:22,418
I wish we had some
rockets right now.

862
00:57:22,527 --> 00:57:25,553
What would the papers
say if you got arrested?

863
00:57:25,663 --> 00:57:26,994
All the good
stuff's illegal.

864
00:57:40,244 --> 00:57:41,905
I wish you still
flew rockets.

865
00:57:42,013 --> 00:57:43,207
Yeah, me too.

866
00:57:45,750 --> 00:57:47,945
There's nowhere to fly
rockets in New York probably.

867
00:57:48,052 --> 00:57:49,542
I'm sure there's
probably somewhere.

868
00:57:51,122 --> 00:57:52,214
If I study physics
in college,

869
00:57:52,323 --> 00:57:53,722
I bet you I get
to fly rockets.

870
00:57:56,494 --> 00:57:58,086
That'd be fucking great, man.

871
00:57:58,196 --> 00:57:59,561
I don't want to be a
scientist but I still...

872
00:57:59,664 --> 00:58:00,790
want to know that stuff.

873
00:58:01,399 --> 00:58:02,991
Well, model rockets
ain't brain surgery.

874
00:58:04,936 --> 00:58:07,803
How'd I ever wind up
singing on an album, anyway?

875
00:58:07,905 --> 00:58:10,738
I mean, I can't even sing.

876
00:58:10,842 --> 00:58:12,742
Tell that to the
Wal-Mart crowd.

877
00:58:17,048 --> 00:58:19,107
You know, mom has big
plans for you this summer.

878
00:58:21,119 --> 00:58:22,780
Hey...

879
00:58:22,887 --> 00:58:24,855
I don't like that look.

880
00:58:24,956 --> 00:58:26,355
I mean, I've seen that look
on you several times...

881
00:58:26,457 --> 00:58:27,549
since I've been out here.

882
00:58:29,494 --> 00:58:30,426
It's all O.K.

883
00:58:30,528 --> 00:58:32,655
Yeah, you keep
telling yourself that,

884
00:58:32,764 --> 00:58:35,494
but your shoulders, they
say something different.

885
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:37,795
It's like you get all
hunchbacked or something.

886
00:58:41,139 --> 00:58:42,834
It can't be that bad, right?

887
00:58:42,940 --> 00:58:44,134
All I have to do is show up.

888
00:58:44,242 --> 00:58:45,539
Everything else
is taken care of.

889
00:58:45,643 --> 00:58:47,611
It's more than just
showing up and you know it.

890
00:58:49,047 --> 00:58:51,413
I'm worried about what's
going to happen in the fall.

891
00:58:51,516 --> 00:58:53,040
What's going to
happen in the fall?

892
00:58:53,151 --> 00:58:54,778
You know what I mean.

893
00:58:54,886 --> 00:58:56,547
If you decide not
to finish school.

894
00:58:56,654 --> 00:58:58,485
I have to finish school.

895
00:58:58,589 --> 00:59:01,581
Yeah, well, suppose the
summer turns out great, Max?

896
00:59:01,692 --> 00:59:04,684
Suppose mom can book
another tour for the fall?

897
00:59:04,796 --> 00:59:06,889
It's like you're both avoiding
the inevitable, you and her.

898
00:59:09,367 --> 00:59:12,268
What if I went to the
science magnet next year?

899
00:59:12,370 --> 00:59:14,270
Point is, you're
already a professional.

900
00:59:15,206 --> 00:59:16,503
You have the ability
to make lots of money...

901
00:59:16,607 --> 00:59:18,370
and mom and dad both know it.

902
00:59:18,476 --> 00:59:20,307
And I don't believe that
they don't want you...

903
00:59:20,411 --> 00:59:22,504
to get a good education.

904
00:59:22,613 --> 00:59:24,376
I just don't see how
you're going to do both.

905
00:59:43,101 --> 00:59:44,966
I just don't see how you can
be his business partner...

906
00:59:45,069 --> 00:59:46,161
and his mother.

907
00:59:49,207 --> 00:59:52,665
Everything about the way I set
up the tour is to protect him.

908
00:59:52,777 --> 00:59:55,211
Yeah, well, there's things
you can't protect him from, mom.

909
00:59:55,313 --> 00:59:55,972
Trust me.

910
00:59:58,583 --> 00:59:59,709
What's going on
with you guys?

911
00:59:59,817 --> 01:00:00,613
Nothing.

912
01:00:03,221 --> 01:00:05,086
Were you drunk when he
went over there last night?

913
01:00:05,189 --> 01:00:06,053
No.

914
01:00:06,157 --> 01:00:09,649
After a certain hour I can
only assume that you were.

915
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:12,194
And I've asked you not
to see him in that state.

916
01:00:12,296 --> 01:00:12,853
You know what?

917
01:00:12,964 --> 01:00:14,261
I'm not going to play
into what you're doing.

918
01:00:14,365 --> 01:00:15,127
What am I doing?

919
01:00:15,233 --> 01:00:16,393
You don't even know
you're doing it!

920
01:00:22,340 --> 01:00:24,240
So...
What's up with you?

921
01:00:26,043 --> 01:00:29,069
It's been a long time
since we've talked.

922
01:00:29,180 --> 01:00:30,647
Makes me happy.

923
01:00:30,748 --> 01:00:32,147
Yeah, well,
when you say things like...

924
01:00:32,250 --> 01:00:34,275
'l asked you not to
see him in that state'...

925
01:00:34,385 --> 01:00:36,512
You justify taking
control of Max.

926
01:00:36,621 --> 01:00:38,452
Like, what, he needs you?

927
01:00:38,556 --> 01:00:40,524
I've got news
for you, he does.

928
01:00:41,792 --> 01:00:45,057
And I haven't done a bad job,
all things considered.

929
01:00:45,163 --> 01:00:46,755
Meaning what, I haven't
done a good job?

930
01:00:46,864 --> 01:00:48,525
Meaning I don't want your
self-destructiveness...

931
01:00:48,633 --> 01:00:50,828
to ever seem like a
viable option to him!

932
01:00:52,236 --> 01:00:54,227
That's really interesting,
coming from you.

933
01:00:54,338 --> 01:00:56,363
What the hell are
you talking about?

934
01:00:56,474 --> 01:00:58,669
You don't know what it means
to turn your life around...

935
01:00:58,776 --> 01:01:00,437
the way that I had to.

936
01:01:00,545 --> 01:01:03,241
I wanted you to, I did.

937
01:01:03,347 --> 01:01:05,178
But did you ever really
want to know me, mom?

938
01:01:07,952 --> 01:01:09,214
You escaped, O.K.?

939
01:01:11,289 --> 01:01:13,223
How could I get the chance
to get to know you?

940
01:01:13,324 --> 01:01:15,053
I earned the
right to escape.

941
01:01:15,159 --> 01:01:17,093
And once I did
you thought, what...

942
01:01:17,195 --> 01:01:19,686
that you could just
hand over all your shit?

943
01:01:19,797 --> 01:01:22,664
Like it was going to float away
on some magical fucking tour bus?!

944
01:01:25,870 --> 01:01:28,839
I don't have the keys
to your prison, mom.

945
01:01:28,940 --> 01:01:31,033
And I don't want to spend
any more time there.

946
01:01:32,710 --> 01:01:35,042
And one day Max is going to
surprise the hell out of you...

947
01:01:35,146 --> 01:01:37,011
and he's going to
figure out, hey,

948
01:01:37,114 --> 01:01:40,242
he can actually have the type
of family he's always wanted.

949
01:01:41,786 --> 01:01:43,344
And you're not going
to be a part of it.

950
01:02:54,859 --> 01:02:55,883
Give it to him yourself.

951
01:03:23,521 --> 01:03:25,853
It's Chiapas, '97.

952
01:03:26,657 --> 01:03:29,182
She kept us from getting
shot about half a dozen times.

953
01:03:30,594 --> 01:03:31,891
I won't ask how.

954
01:03:31,996 --> 01:03:34,294
Beats me.
It was all in Spanish.

955
01:03:35,933 --> 01:03:37,400
How is she anyway?

956
01:03:37,501 --> 01:03:38,490
She's cool.

957
01:03:40,504 --> 01:03:41,528
What's the deal
with you and her?

958
01:03:43,007 --> 01:03:44,167
Like what?

959
01:03:44,275 --> 01:03:46,402
Like how are you
going to love her now?

960
01:03:46,510 --> 01:03:47,636
Like I always did.

961
01:03:48,512 --> 01:03:50,446
You can't.
It's different now.

962
01:03:52,216 --> 01:03:55,242
You're always assuming that
everyone's fucking everyone else.

963
01:04:00,991 --> 01:04:02,583
It meant a lot to
her for a long time.

964
01:04:04,528 --> 01:04:05,654
Now she thinks you need it.

965
01:04:08,032 --> 01:04:09,556
Need it for what?

966
01:04:09,667 --> 01:04:10,827
Protection, man.

967
01:04:12,970 --> 01:04:13,994
Be protected.

968
01:04:22,046 --> 01:04:24,879
You know my favorite
part of Mexico, right?

969
01:04:24,982 --> 01:04:26,813
Why don't we go down
to Baja for a while,

970
01:04:26,917 --> 01:04:27,906
just you and me?

971
01:04:29,253 --> 01:04:31,448
Yesterday it was all
about finishing school.

972
01:04:31,555 --> 01:04:33,147
Yeah, well, that's
what tutors are for.

973
01:04:33,257 --> 01:04:36,454
You know, you study for
a year, take your SATs,

974
01:04:36,560 --> 01:04:40,587
next thing you know you'll
wind up at Columbia U or CalTech.

975
01:04:41,899 --> 01:04:42,957
That's ridiculous.

976
01:04:43,067 --> 01:04:44,364
You've got a girlfriend
waiting for you.

977
01:04:45,736 --> 01:04:47,067
Yeah, not anymore I don't.

978
01:04:48,472 --> 01:04:49,461
You ended it?

979
01:04:50,875 --> 01:04:52,274
We mutually ended it.

980
01:04:53,711 --> 01:04:55,372
-Sad.
-Why?

981
01:04:57,248 --> 01:04:59,239
You never liked
the bitch anyway.

982
01:04:59,350 --> 01:05:01,511
It's sad because you
don't have anyone.

983
01:05:06,157 --> 01:05:07,852
What do you want when
I get back from Japan?

984
01:05:09,994 --> 01:05:11,962
I want someone who's going
to be there for me, O.K.?

985
01:05:14,398 --> 01:05:15,956
I want someone
I can really love.

986
01:05:18,102 --> 01:05:19,569
I thought that was
what I was offering?

987
01:05:40,691 --> 01:05:41,783
Hey Jordan.

988
01:05:41,892 --> 01:05:43,223
How was your flight?

989
01:05:44,829 --> 01:05:46,160
That doesn't sound good.

990
01:05:46,263 --> 01:05:47,662
I'm starving, though.

991
01:05:47,765 --> 01:05:49,733
Nothing kills this
guy's appetite.

992
01:05:49,834 --> 01:05:50,994
Smells great.

993
01:05:51,101 --> 01:05:55,367
I remember the gallery owner said
that Max was going to be there,
right?

994
01:05:55,473 --> 01:05:57,839
I was like, oh my God, what's
this turning into, an event?

995
01:05:59,477 --> 01:06:01,536
Everything with
Max is an event.

996
01:06:01,645 --> 01:06:03,169
How did the show do, anyway?

997
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:05,043
I sold 4 paintings.

998
01:06:05,149 --> 01:06:06,514
The best one
was to your mom.

999
01:06:07,384 --> 01:06:08,282
She has good taste.

1000
01:06:08,385 --> 01:06:09,852
And a shark's
instincts, too.

1001
01:06:09,954 --> 01:06:11,649
I was the one who
told her to buy it.

1002
01:06:11,755 --> 01:06:12,744
Liar.

1003
01:06:12,857 --> 01:06:14,256
She chose it herself.

1004
01:06:15,025 --> 01:06:16,049
You wouldn't have even
noticed me standing there...

1005
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:17,184
if she hadn't come up.

1006
01:06:19,263 --> 01:06:21,060
I've never seen the
painting in question.

1007
01:06:21,165 --> 01:06:22,792
-I've got a slide of it...
-Oh yeah?

1008
01:06:23,734 --> 01:06:24,598
Well, let's see it.

1009
01:06:27,838 --> 01:06:31,205
As usual, the slide's a pale
representation of the thing.

1010
01:06:31,308 --> 01:06:32,138
Great ass.

1011
01:06:36,647 --> 01:06:38,376
That was some
amazing meal, pal.

1012
01:06:38,482 --> 01:06:39,744
Thanks.

1013
01:06:39,850 --> 01:06:41,977
You know, this is the first
time I think we've got to talk...

1014
01:06:42,086 --> 01:06:45,078
without, you know, being
in the middle of some crowd.

1015
01:06:45,189 --> 01:06:47,020
Yeah, I guess it is.

1016
01:06:47,124 --> 01:06:49,718
How's things going
with you and Max?

1017
01:06:49,827 --> 01:06:53,388
-They're going great.
-Good to hear, good to hear.

1018
01:06:53,497 --> 01:06:55,089
How are things going with
you and your girlfriend?

1019
01:06:55,199 --> 01:06:56,632
The same.

1020
01:06:56,734 --> 01:06:59,794
-Is that good or bad?
-It's neutral.

1021
01:06:59,904 --> 01:07:01,895
Nothing like you and Max.

1022
01:07:02,006 --> 01:07:03,303
How so?

1023
01:07:05,142 --> 01:07:07,770
You guys are like the
perfect couple, right?

1024
01:07:10,047 --> 01:07:12,515
You got yourself one
gorgeous man here, Max.

1025
01:07:12,616 --> 01:07:13,844
Move over.

1026
01:07:28,666 --> 01:07:30,031
Wait a minute...

1027
01:07:30,134 --> 01:07:32,625
do I even get a vote
in this or what?

1028
01:07:32,736 --> 01:07:34,795
Well, you know my vote.

1029
01:07:34,905 --> 01:07:37,840
For love, forever
and always.

1030
01:07:39,109 --> 01:07:41,134
Well, I don't think
it's a good idea.

1031
01:07:41,245 --> 01:07:42,610
I mean, not that I don't think
you're a great guy or anything...

1032
01:07:42,713 --> 01:07:44,738
You know, it seems like
the guys I always want...

1033
01:07:44,848 --> 01:07:47,578
are always questioning
my motives.

1034
01:07:47,685 --> 01:07:49,846
Don't pretend you
really want me, man.

1035
01:07:51,188 --> 01:07:52,587
I fuckin' want you.

1036
01:07:54,191 --> 01:07:56,751
I'm like in a committed
relationship with your brother.

1037
01:07:56,860 --> 01:07:59,192
And I respect that totally.

1038
01:07:59,296 --> 01:08:00,729
Just because we
all like each other...

1039
01:08:00,831 --> 01:08:02,355
doesn't mean we have
to fuck each other.

1040
01:08:04,368 --> 01:08:06,063
Well, I want to
fuck you and Max.

1041
01:08:07,438 --> 01:08:09,531
And I'm not used to not
getting what I want.

1042
01:08:09,640 --> 01:08:10,834
Well, that's great.

1043
01:08:10,941 --> 01:08:12,431
But the vote needs
to be unanimous.

1044
01:08:12,543 --> 01:08:14,943
You haven't even got a
fucking majority, bro.

1045
01:08:21,018 --> 01:08:22,747
I got nothing.

1046
01:08:22,853 --> 01:08:25,287
I don't got the one guy l
ever really loved, either.

1047
01:08:25,389 --> 01:08:26,879
That's bullshit.

1048
01:08:26,991 --> 01:08:29,357
I've always been there for
you, that's the problem.

1049
01:08:31,362 --> 01:08:32,989
I can't take care
of you anymore.

1050
01:08:33,097 --> 01:08:34,257
No one asked you to.

1051
01:08:34,365 --> 01:08:36,856
Oh right.
It was just my job.

1052
01:08:38,302 --> 01:08:40,133
That's pretty funny.

1053
01:08:40,237 --> 01:08:41,226
What is?

1054
01:08:47,044 --> 01:08:49,410
I always thought it was our
job to take care of each other.

1055
01:08:57,955 --> 01:09:00,822
Hey don't get me wrong.
I was happy when he met you.

1056
01:09:01,558 --> 01:09:04,425
It was the very thing that he
needed to get out of that situation.

1057
01:09:04,528 --> 01:09:06,792
-What situation?
-The home situation.

1058
01:09:10,968 --> 01:09:13,630
I always wanted Max to be
what he never got to be.

1059
01:09:15,205 --> 01:09:16,729
A normal kid.

1060
01:09:19,777 --> 01:09:21,369
Well, that's some
kind of fantasy.

1061
01:09:21,478 --> 01:09:23,912
Because he's not
a normal kid.

1062
01:09:24,014 --> 01:09:25,208
Same with you.

1063
01:09:29,987 --> 01:09:35,220
Well...I've disgraced myself
for the umpteenth time,

1064
01:09:35,325 --> 01:09:38,055
so...I'm just going
to let myself out.

1065
01:09:52,443 --> 01:09:53,774
Last chance boys...

1066
01:10:01,819 --> 01:10:04,049
That was the last
time we saw Harry.

1067
01:10:04,154 --> 01:10:05,086
For a while.

1068
01:10:06,657 --> 01:10:10,093
I'd already done a second
album which came out and sold well.

1069
01:10:10,194 --> 01:10:13,254
Nobody seemed to care that
it was all in the backup vocals.

1070
01:10:15,399 --> 01:10:16,764
When I fired my
mom as my manager,

1071
01:10:16,867 --> 01:10:19,836
she sued me for a
percentage of royalties.

1072
01:10:19,937 --> 01:10:23,429
I settled the lawsuit but
we haven't spoken since.

1073
01:10:25,342 --> 01:10:27,173
After that I got into
a good university.

1074
01:10:28,545 --> 01:10:29,671
The work is hard.

1075
01:10:33,083 --> 01:10:35,779
We saw my brother pretty
often when he was in town.

1076
01:10:35,886 --> 01:10:38,252
But...something was different.

1077
01:10:39,556 --> 01:10:43,151
Maybe he'd grown up, especially
after his solo album flopped.

1078
01:10:47,731 --> 01:10:50,632
Jordan got to know him well,
even sold him a painting.

1079
01:10:51,735 --> 01:10:52,997
It was good for
the both of them.

1080
01:10:55,506 --> 01:10:58,407
Over time the public's
taste in boy bands moved on.

1081
01:10:59,576 --> 01:11:01,806
I think Harry was
secretly relieved.

1082
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:05,075
He spent more and
more time in Japan,

1083
01:11:05,182 --> 01:11:06,877
where he always
had a following.

1084
01:11:09,686 --> 01:11:11,551
Growing up I liked
what we had together.

1085
01:11:13,357 --> 01:11:15,552
Most people wouldn't have
wanted a brother like Harry.

1086
01:11:17,094 --> 01:11:19,562
But we couldn't help but
be right for each other.

1087
01:11:20,964 --> 01:11:22,090
Look, look, look, ties!

1088
01:11:24,735 --> 01:11:25,667
No rails, though.

1089
01:11:25,769 --> 01:11:29,000
Yeah, they took that shit
away a long time ago.

1090
01:11:29,106 --> 01:11:31,506
That sucks elephant dicks.

1091
01:11:31,608 --> 01:11:34,042
And it's getting cold again.
Wait!
