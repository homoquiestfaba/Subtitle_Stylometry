1
00:00:04,705 --> 00:00:05,504
I think it's cool
that I got the salad

2
00:00:08,108 --> 00:00:08,441
but the point was
to eat a salad to be healthier

3
00:00:12,145 --> 00:00:13,779
and there's bread
underneath it--

4
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:16,182
Well, they said
it was a crostini,

5
00:00:16,183 --> 00:00:17,283
which is usually smaller.

6
00:00:17,284 --> 00:00:18,551
What is it called?

7
00:00:18,552 --> 00:00:20,753
- I should pay more attention.
- A crostini. It's Italian.

8
00:00:20,754 --> 00:00:24,190
It's good, I mean, I guess.
It's the whole bread thing.

9
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:26,659
I don't want to complain.
I complain too much as it is.

10
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:27,660
You do complain but--

11
00:00:27,661 --> 00:00:29,528
It's good.
Did you like yours?

12
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,230
Oh, that's cool.
What is that?

13
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:34,033
Open it.

14
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:35,167
Really?

15
00:00:35,168 --> 00:00:36,802
Yeah.

16
00:00:36,803 --> 00:00:37,503
This is really nice.

17
00:00:38,772 --> 00:00:41,040
Oh, this is really pretty.

18
00:00:42,676 --> 00:00:45,578
It goes on your other hand.

19
00:00:45,579 --> 00:00:46,412
The left.

20
00:00:46,413 --> 00:00:47,547
- The left hand?
- Yeah.

21
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:50,149
What is that? Is that Arabic?
What does that mean?

22
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:52,251
No, the guy at the store
said it was Tibetan.

23
00:00:52,252 --> 00:00:56,422
It means to overcome obstacles.

24
00:00:56,423 --> 00:00:58,157
- Oh, that's really nice.
- I thought it was
perfect for you.

25
00:00:58,158 --> 00:01:00,626
This is really pretty.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

26
00:01:00,627 --> 00:01:03,062
What's the occasion?
I mean, It's just...nice.

27
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:06,432
I mean...thank you.

28
00:01:06,433 --> 00:01:08,267
Erik. I want to...

29
00:01:08,268 --> 00:01:10,736
I'm...

30
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:14,307
I'm asking you if
you want to marry me?

31
00:01:14,308 --> 00:01:16,242
This is an engagement ring?

32
00:01:16,243 --> 00:01:18,678
Yeah. Yeah and I...

33
00:01:18,679 --> 00:01:21,547
Um....

34
00:01:21,548 --> 00:01:22,348
Here at the restaurant?
I mean...

35
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:26,052
Not here.
We can't do this here.

36
00:01:27,487 --> 00:01:28,621
Why not here?
Why?

37
00:01:28,622 --> 00:01:32,592
It's such a cliché.
You're into that kind of thing.

38
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:34,493
It's nice. It's pretty.
I mean, I can wear it...

39
00:01:34,494 --> 00:01:36,262
I can wear it like--

40
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:38,364
So you're saying no?

41
00:01:38,365 --> 00:01:41,400
Yes.

42
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:42,702
I'm saying "No."
I mean, I'm saying, "No!"But "No" doesn't
always mean "Yes',

43
00:01:42,703 --> 00:01:44,303
but in this case it does.

44
00:01:44,304 --> 00:01:45,571
So, you know...

45
00:01:45,572 --> 00:01:47,440
Wow. Okay.

46
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:49,442
Look, you're not
thinking this through.

47
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:51,277
- That's just what I'm saying.
- Yes, I have.

48
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:54,747
I thought...what?

49
00:01:54,748 --> 00:01:57,249
It's just, I know this is your
attempt at being post-feminist and post-modern, after reading
that Sheryl Sandberg book.

50
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:59,251
You want to say,
"Let's reverse it

51
00:01:59,252 --> 00:02:01,087
so the girl now
proposes to the guy"

52
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:02,388
because that's what
you're supposed--

53
00:02:02,389 --> 00:02:06,292
Erik, I don't really care what
you're about to say right now.

54
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:09,428
But I want to get married
and I want to have babies. So...

55
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:11,297
But you're also doing really
well at your job right now.

56
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:12,431
You're excelling so much.

57
00:02:12,432 --> 00:02:15,668
You're rising up
in the law firm.

58
00:02:15,669 --> 00:02:17,203
You're doing really well.

59
00:02:17,204 --> 00:02:18,437
And like Sheryl Sandberg said,

60
00:02:18,438 --> 00:02:20,506
"We need more women
in positions of power."

61
00:02:20,507 --> 00:02:20,940
Most women in powerful
positions are married.

62
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:25,444
Sheryl Sandberg is married.

63
00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:26,912
There's an entire chapter
about that,

64
00:02:26,913 --> 00:02:28,347
about how amazing
her partner is

65
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:29,448
and how she couldn't
do it without him,

66
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:30,583
especially when
she was pregnant.

67
00:02:30,584 --> 00:02:32,818
Okay, but at the same time,
you have an obligation

68
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,587
to be a housewife.

69
00:02:34,588 --> 00:02:36,622
If you're...

70
00:02:36,623 --> 00:02:38,257
I have an obligation
to be a housewife?

71
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:39,692
I'm just saying
that if you're working,

72
00:02:39,693 --> 00:02:41,360
you can't do both.

73
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:43,329
I mean, I didn't read the book
so I don't know

74
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:44,797
but you can't,
you can't do both.

75
00:02:44,798 --> 00:02:47,199
How can you not do both?

76
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,567
Because someone
has to cook and clean.

77
00:02:48,568 --> 00:02:50,269
Well, you can cook and clean.

78
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:53,172
I'm Turkish.

79
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:54,807
Turkish men don't do
that kind of thing.Are you playing
the Turkish card again?

80
00:02:54,808 --> 00:02:56,542
I'm also a dirty person.

81
00:02:56,543 --> 00:02:59,278
Dirty people don't have the
disposition for being clean.

82
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:01,447
And because I'm dirty
I shouldn't cook either

83
00:03:01,448 --> 00:03:03,382
because that's unhygienic
in a lot of ways.

84
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:06,352
I mean, this is like...

85
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:08,854
My mother says that
I should break up with you.

86
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:11,824
See, imagine how she'd
feel if we got married.

87
00:03:11,825 --> 00:03:14,660
No, this is precisely why she
wants me to break up with you.

88
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:17,363
Because you won't marry me.

89
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:20,366
Well, I hate your mom anyway.
I mean...

90
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:22,435
I don't hate her like that.
I'm just kidding.

91
00:03:22,436 --> 00:03:23,669
In a playful way i hate her.

92
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:26,672
But if she died tomorrow,
I wouldn't be that upset or sad.

93
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:28,574
I mean, I'd be sad
because you'd be sad probably.

94
00:03:28,575 --> 00:03:31,243
I'd lament for a--
I'd pretend to lament for

95
00:03:31,244 --> 00:03:33,312
maybe like a week or two
or something like that.

96
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:35,381
It's just...you know?

97
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:36,282
Hey. Look, you're not
going to storm off

98
00:03:38,752 --> 00:03:40,386
and make a scene are you?

99
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:42,521
Why would I do that?

100
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:43,489
Because you're upset.

101
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:45,591
To be dramatic,
you know, to make a scene.

102
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:48,494
Oh right, because I'm a woman,
I'm going to be dramatic?
I'm going to the bathroom.

103
00:03:48,495 --> 00:03:49,695
Okay, good.

104
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:52,331
Because I just want to
drink my beer and...

105
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:54,767
My joints hurt.
I just want to relax.

106
00:03:57,838 --> 00:03:59,472
I don't want to
do this anymore.

107
00:03:59,473 --> 00:04:00,573
Come on, Jody.

108
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:03,709
I don't.

109
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:06,512
You always do this every time
we get into an argument, you do this.

110
00:04:06,513 --> 00:04:07,813
You get fatalistic
about the relationship, and then you want to break up.

111
00:04:07,814 --> 00:04:10,716
And then we go back home
and then we start kissing

112
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:13,752
and everything works out.

113
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:16,322
I don't want to be with someone
who doesn't want to get married.I don't want to be with someone
who doesn't want to have babies.

114
00:04:16,323 --> 00:04:18,357
Jody, babies are worthless.

115
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:20,493
I don't want to be with someone
who thinks babies are worthless.

116
00:04:20,494 --> 00:04:22,495
Come on.

117
00:04:22,496 --> 00:04:24,730
This is ridiculous.
You're being silly.

118
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:26,232
You know?

119
00:04:26,233 --> 00:04:27,166
Jody?

120
00:04:27,701 --> 00:04:30,536
- Jason?
- Hey.

121
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,540
- How are you?
- Oh my God.

122
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:36,442
Oh my God.
Are you still here in New York?

123
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:37,843
Do you live here?

124
00:04:37,844 --> 00:04:39,578
Yeah.
Do you?

125
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:40,946
Yes. Yeah. Yeah.

126
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:41,247
- I just got a job on
Park Avenue at a law firm.
- Oh my God.

127
00:04:44,851 --> 00:04:46,919
- That's incredible.
- Wow!

128
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,921
- This is incredible to see you.
- I know.

129
00:04:48,922 --> 00:04:51,457
It's incredible to see you too.
Hey there.

130
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,659
- Hey.
- Erik.

131
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:54,960
Erik.

132
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:58,564
- Yes, I'm uh...I am. I'm, uh...
- Hey.

133
00:04:58,565 --> 00:04:59,965
Yeah...it's nice to meet you.

134
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:01,867
Yeah.
I'm Jason.

135
00:05:01,868 --> 00:05:03,302
- Nice to meet you.
- Yeah.

136
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,738
I'm Erik.

137
00:05:05,739 --> 00:05:08,507
- How are you?
- Cool.

138
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:10,876
- This is so crazy.
- This is crazy.

139
00:05:10,877 --> 00:05:13,512
I feel like I haven't
seen you...

140
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:14,947
- I don't even know when.
- I don't know.

141
00:05:14,948 --> 00:05:16,882
Look, it's great that you guys
are catching up and everything

142
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:18,818
but it's probably not the
best time to be talking

143
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:22,721
because we're in the middle
of a conversation. So...

144
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:25,858
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- Oh, no, no, no.

145
00:05:25,859 --> 00:05:27,860
It was good to see you.

146
00:05:27,861 --> 00:05:29,461
We'll catch up sometime later.

147
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:30,763
No, no.

148
00:05:30,764 --> 00:05:32,731
I was just saying good-bye to
him but he kept following me.

149
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:34,567
- It's totally fine.
- That's funny.

150
00:05:34,568 --> 00:05:36,869
No, she's my girlfriend.
We're boyfriend and girlfriend.

151
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:39,038
We're just having a argument
right now and...

152
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:41,106
Okay.

153
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:43,909
You know, stupid
arguments that people have. But it's going to be cool
when the lights go down

154
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:45,811
and our bodies start grooving,
you know what I'm saying.

155
00:05:45,812 --> 00:05:48,881
So you best be moving on,
till the break of dawn, buddy.

156
00:05:48,882 --> 00:05:50,850
I don't want to make trouble,
I just want to make love.

157
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:53,018
So hit the road Jack,
and don't you come back,

158
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:54,587
<i>o more, no more,
no more, no more.</i>

159
00:05:54,588 --> 00:05:55,788
I'm sorry to interrupt.

160
00:05:55,789 --> 00:05:56,922
No, no,
you weren't interrupting.

161
00:05:56,923 --> 00:05:58,457
Nice to meet you.

162
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,392
What are you doing?
Do you want to go get a drink?

163
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:04,396
Are you free?
I'm sorry.

164
00:06:04,397 --> 00:06:07,132
Actually, I'm going to meet
Gregory Kohn and Jane...Kohn.

165
00:06:10,971 --> 00:06:13,072
- Oh my God.
They got married?
- Yes.

166
00:06:13,073 --> 00:06:15,608
- Wait. What?
That's amazing.
- I know.

167
00:06:15,609 --> 00:06:17,409
- And she changed her name?
- It's Kohn.

168
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:20,379
That's so great.

169
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,114
She's trying to make
me jealous, Jason.- I can't believe that.
- They would love to see you.

170
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:23,782
- You should totally come.
- I would love to see them.

171
00:06:23,783 --> 00:06:25,784
- It's about four blocks down.
- Great.

172
00:06:25,785 --> 00:06:28,020
Jason, she's trying
to make me jealous.

173
00:06:28,021 --> 00:06:29,488
- Oh, just pay no
attention to him.
- It's true.

174
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:30,823
You guys obviously
used to know each other.

175
00:06:30,824 --> 00:06:34,093
We're having an argument
and you walk up and...

176
00:06:34,094 --> 00:06:35,995
- Listen.
- He's pathological.

177
00:06:35,996 --> 00:06:38,397
- Maybe you two used to
have a relationship.
- Erik, just stop.

178
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:39,932
I understand what you're
trying to do, okay.

179
00:06:39,933 --> 00:06:43,602
Maybe you had a
relationship before.

180
00:06:43,603 --> 00:06:44,837
- Maybe you think you're
going to heavy pet.
- Erik, stop. - Is everything okay here?
- Stop.

181
00:06:44,838 --> 00:06:46,472
Everything's really fine.
Of course.

182
00:06:46,473 --> 00:06:48,407
- I'm just holding my woman.
- Let go of me.

183
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:51,610
She just asked you
to let go of her,
so now you let go of her.

184
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:52,978
- But she's my girlfriend.
- I'm not your girlfriend.

185
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:54,847
And that's what you're
allowed to do

186
00:06:54,848 --> 00:06:56,482
- when you're dating someone.
- I'm not your girlfriend.

187
00:06:56,483 --> 00:06:57,783
I'll help.

188
00:06:57,784 --> 00:06:59,752
- Do you want to go get a drink?
- Yeah. I would love to.

189
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:04,156
All right.

190
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:05,024
- Good-night, Erik.
- Hey...uh...

191
00:07:05,025 --> 00:07:07,626
Have a good night, man.

192
00:07:09,062 --> 00:07:09,962
You should shave,
button up that shirt.

193
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:15,968
Maybe get a fucking job.
All right?

194
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:00,913
Hey.

195
00:08:00,914 --> 00:08:01,647
Jesus Christ.

196
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:06,085
I thought I was
having a bad night.

197
00:08:06,086 --> 00:08:09,154
You're in bad shape.
Do you need some help?

198
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,222
Can you tell me
what you need?

199
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:12,825
What can I do for you?

200
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:15,127
I think your vocal chords
have been ripped out

201
00:08:15,128 --> 00:08:17,496
and you can't speak.

202
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:21,000
Can you do sign language?
Can you sign what you need?

203
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:22,935
Can you use sign language?

204
00:08:26,773 --> 00:08:28,674
You do know sign language.
Wow.

205
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:31,677
I don't know sign language
so I can't help you.

206
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:34,713
But I dated a deaf girl
in college actually.

207
00:08:34,714 --> 00:08:35,714
She broke up with me

208
00:08:35,715 --> 00:08:37,883
because I was always
farting in front of her.

209
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:39,651
I didn't think she would mind
so much.

210
00:08:39,652 --> 00:08:41,720
God, we have to stymie
that blood flow.

211
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:42,888
Holy shit.

212
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:45,157
I wish I could call 911
but I don't have a cell phone.

213
00:08:45,158 --> 00:08:46,225
I don't have a handkerchief.

214
00:08:46,226 --> 00:08:49,828
But my girlfriend makes me
carry a spare tampon

215
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:50,996
because she forgets
them sometimes.

216
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:54,266
Let me just try this.
Let me just pull this out here.

217
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:56,168
No, no.
Don't do that.

218
00:08:56,169 --> 00:08:56,301
Just hold still.
Oh Jesus!

219
00:09:00,006 --> 00:09:00,339
Oh, are you HIV negative,
I hope?

220
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:06,545
Oh man.
Oh my God. Look...

221
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,726
Hey.

222
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:21,393
Are you still there?

223
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:24,730
Are you gone?

224
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:28,867
Look, you're still
breathing a little bit

225
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:35,007
so maybe there's still
time possibly.

226
00:09:35,008 --> 00:09:37,109
I'll try to go call for help,
okay?

227
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:39,845
Maybe keep the wound
elevated if you can?

228
00:09:39,846 --> 00:09:43,082
If you can find the energy to
get to your feet or something,

229
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,550
maybe there's still a chance.

230
00:09:44,551 --> 00:09:46,085
I'll try to go find someone.

231
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:47,853
Okay?

232
00:09:47,854 --> 00:09:49,955
Hey, hey.

233
00:09:49,956 --> 00:09:51,857
Excuse me.
Sorry to bother you.

234
00:09:51,858 --> 00:09:53,325
Do you have a cell phone
I could use really quickly,

235
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:54,059
if you don't mind?

236
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:57,329
No. What?

237
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,164
It's not for me.
I don't carry a cell phone.There's a guy down the alleyway
who needs it.

238
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:00,632
- He's dead.
- What?

239
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:01,967
What happened?

240
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:03,202
You should go down there
and look for yourself.

241
00:10:03,203 --> 00:10:04,870
It looks like someone
ripped his throat open.

242
00:10:04,871 --> 00:10:05,771
- What?
- Yeah. Yeah.

243
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:07,372
Did you go to
Westbrook High School?

244
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:09,241
I'm sorry, you look
very very familiar to me.

245
00:10:09,242 --> 00:10:10,075
No, where's Westbrook?

246
00:10:10,076 --> 00:10:11,310
It's in Connecticut.

247
00:10:11,311 --> 00:10:13,812
- Oh really.
- Yeah.

248
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:15,914
No, I didn't go there.
Yeah, do I remind you-- People tell me that I remind
them of someone all the time.

249
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:17,749
You totally remind me
of a guy.

250
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,885
I get Jerry Garcia constantly.

251
00:10:19,886 --> 00:10:22,087
- Jerry Garcia?
- Yeah, I totally get that.

252
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:24,289
Oh my God, my mom was like,
the biggest deadhead.

253
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,858
Was she a deadhead?

254
00:10:25,859 --> 00:10:27,793
She took me to a dead show
right before Jerry died.

255
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:29,628
- Oh really?
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

256
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,230
You do kind of look like Jerry.

257
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:36,735
Look,
I need to tell you something

258
00:10:36,736 --> 00:10:38,737
but I don't want you
to freak out.

259
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:41,740
What?

260
00:10:41,741 --> 00:10:42,774
They're seriously
considering getting rid of you. - Why?
- Why?

261
00:10:42,775 --> 00:10:44,209
Because you are by far
the worst sales person

262
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:45,677
in this office, that's why.

263
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:48,947
Someone has to be the worst.

264
00:10:48,948 --> 00:10:51,216
And when you consider
how good everyone is here, being the worst isn't bad.

265
00:10:51,217 --> 00:10:53,318
You complain constantly.

266
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,854
Everyone is sick of it,
especially upper management.

267
00:10:55,855 --> 00:10:57,990
Being unsatisfied is
a sign of ambition.

268
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:00,692
Every day you come in late
and you leave early.

269
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:03,328
I'm trying to stand out.

270
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:05,664
- You have no discipline.
- That's not true.I once went three weeks
without watching internet porn.

271
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:06,832
You don't own a cell phone.

272
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,667
I think I have
testicular cancer.

273
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,135
I don't need a brain tumor too.

274
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:12,237
Do you realize that you are
fundamentally incapable

275
00:11:12,238 --> 00:11:14,039
of taking anything seriously?

276
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,208
Yeah, because there's already
enough drama in the world

277
00:11:16,209 --> 00:11:17,209
as it is. I mean...

278
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:19,811
Here's the bottom line.

279
00:11:19,812 --> 00:11:21,046
Unless you start pulling
your weight around here,they're going to get rid of you.

280
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:23,015
It's hard pulling
my weight, Jamie.

281
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:24,816
- Have you seen my stomach?
- I'm serious.

282
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:26,952
But you've always taken
things too seriously.

283
00:11:26,953 --> 00:11:29,321
Get your shit together.

284
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:36,762
Jody and I broke up last night.

285
00:11:36,763 --> 00:11:38,397
Hmm?

286
00:11:38,398 --> 00:11:41,366
I broke up with Jody last night.

287
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,402
Who's Jody?

288
00:11:43,403 --> 00:11:45,737
My ex-girlfriend.

289
00:11:45,738 --> 00:11:48,206
Three years,
we've been dating.

290
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:49,775
Three years.

291
00:11:49,776 --> 00:11:51,410
I thought you were asexual.

292
00:11:52,312 --> 00:11:54,846
Me?
Asexual? Me?

293
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:58,717
Yeah.

294
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:01,153
I've had like, three STDs.

295
00:12:01,154 --> 00:12:03,822
That's how asexual I am.

296
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:07,025
Hello.

297
00:12:09,028 --> 00:12:11,830
- Oh hi, Mr. Waters.
- I was kidding about
those STDs.

298
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:13,832
- What?
- I was kidding about the STDs.

299
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:15,500
I was joking...

300
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:17,302
So, I was reviewing
your order and...

301
00:12:33,286 --> 00:12:35,087
I really wish you wouldn't
show up like this unannounced.

302
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:36,488
I don't have a cell phone.
You know I don't.

303
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:38,290
- What do you want?
- I just want to talk.

304
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:39,424
Go ahead.

305
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:41,159
Jody, forgive me.
I'm sorry.

306
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,461
Okay.

307
00:12:54,741 --> 00:12:56,241
Hey.

308
00:12:56,242 --> 00:12:57,142
Oh great.
It's you.

309
00:12:59,178 --> 00:13:01,046
Yeah, it's me.

310
00:13:01,047 --> 00:13:02,414
Hey.

311
00:13:06,052 --> 00:13:07,452
Are you going here to see Jody?
Are you seeing Jody? No. No. No.

312
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:09,988
I'm going to vacuum
the carpets.

313
00:13:09,989 --> 00:13:11,356
I do that for the building.

314
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:12,891
Really?
Is that why...really?

315
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:13,992
No.

316
00:13:13,993 --> 00:13:17,062
I'll be honest with you.

317
00:13:17,063 --> 00:13:19,097
There's an old man
on the third floor. He's got boils
all over his back.

318
00:13:19,098 --> 00:13:22,067
I'm here to lance them.

319
00:13:22,068 --> 00:13:23,435
Oh, you're a lancer?
I thought you were a lawyer.No, no, no, no.

320
00:13:23,436 --> 00:13:23,769
I'm a freelance lancer.
A freelancer, if you will.

321
00:13:27,073 --> 00:13:27,973
That's funny

322
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:29,941
because I have a cyst
you can lance,

323
00:13:29,942 --> 00:13:31,777
right here on the tip
of my finger.

324
00:13:31,778 --> 00:13:33,278
You couldn't afford me.

325
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,280
You're wasting your time, bucko.

326
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:36,415
She still loves me.

327
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:39,384
And you don't have
a chance in hell.

328
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:42,220
Ask me how big my dick is.

329
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:43,255
Excuse me?

330
00:13:43,256 --> 00:13:43,388
Ask me how big my dick is.

331
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:48,393
No.

332
00:13:53,066 --> 00:13:55,367
How big is it?
How big?

333
00:13:55,368 --> 00:13:57,836
Ask Jody's vagina.

334
00:14:01,074 --> 00:14:02,941
You're mean.

335
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:08,146
Hey Penelope.

336
00:14:08,147 --> 00:14:10,082
Penelope.

337
00:14:14,253 --> 00:14:15,687
Do you want to
have dinner tonight?

338
00:14:17,056 --> 00:14:18,857
No.

339
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:22,160
I was just kidding.
It was a joke.

340
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:26,598
I wasn't really asking you out.
That was a joke.

341
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:27,766
But if I had been serious,

342
00:14:27,767 --> 00:14:31,903
the place I would have taken you
is really really nice.

343
00:14:31,904 --> 00:14:32,104
The cheapest thing on the menu
is like, eight dollars.

344
00:14:35,308 --> 00:14:37,242
Okay.

345
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:37,776
I'm just curious though.
It's because I'm Turkish, right?

346
00:14:41,347 --> 00:14:42,447
I'm Turkish, you're Jewish.

347
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:44,182
- That's the reason why
- No.

348
00:14:44,183 --> 00:14:46,184
If I were serious,
you wouldn't go out with me.

349
00:14:46,185 --> 00:14:48,987
What's the reason, then?
Why?

350
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:50,522
What's the reason?

351
00:14:50,523 --> 00:14:52,290
Um...

352
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:57,996
Spit it out.

353
00:14:57,997 --> 00:15:00,298
You're just not my type.

354
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:02,367
Be more specific.

355
00:15:02,368 --> 00:15:03,535
You're old.

356
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:34,432
So, have you ever
been here before?

357
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:39,204
- This restaurant?
- Mm-hmm.

358
00:15:39,205 --> 00:15:42,707
Yeah, yeah, I use to
come here a lot actually. - Is your food good?
- Yes, it's excellent.

359
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:44,242
You can try my
salmon if you want.

360
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:45,477
- I love salmon.
- The salmon's great.

361
00:15:45,478 --> 00:15:46,444
Yeah.

362
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:48,647
I don't know if its
farm-raised or not,

363
00:15:48,648 --> 00:15:50,248
which is kind of fucked up,

364
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:52,217
but you know,
you should try it.

365
00:15:52,218 --> 00:15:54,686
But before you do that,
I want to show you my hand,

366
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:57,122
to show you why
farm-raised salmon can be--

367
00:15:57,123 --> 00:15:59,691
You see how my hand
shakes like that.

368
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:01,993
That's due to permanent
nerve damage.

369
00:16:01,994 --> 00:16:03,695
I'm not saying salmon had
something to do with it

370
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:05,997
but it probably did,

371
00:16:05,998 --> 00:16:07,532
but it's not going to
keep me from enjoying it.

372
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:09,267
You know what I'm saying?

373
00:16:09,268 --> 00:16:11,369
It's dangerous lead,
but fuck it.

374
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:13,171
Also, I want to point out
this guy over here.

375
00:16:13,172 --> 00:16:14,472
This Middle Eastern
dude over there.

376
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:17,075
He has the
backpack at his table.

377
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:18,510
Don't look...

378
00:16:18,511 --> 00:16:19,611
Yeah.

379
00:16:19,612 --> 00:16:21,680
What's in the backpack?
You know what I'm saying?

380
00:16:21,681 --> 00:16:23,548
- You understand the point
I'm trying to make?
- What do you mean?

381
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:26,017
I'm just saying that there's
nothing safe anymore.

382
00:16:26,018 --> 00:16:27,018
Safe is dead.

383
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:28,987
You know,
lead in the salmon.

384
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:31,489
Middle Eastern guys
with backpacks. I mean...

385
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:34,025
Do you think that's a
very healthy attitude?

386
00:16:34,026 --> 00:16:36,494
I think it's liberating,
in a lot of ways.

387
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:38,063
How so?

388
00:16:38,064 --> 00:16:40,131
Well if everything is a danger,

389
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:41,633
then there's nothing to fear
for the most part.

390
00:16:41,634 --> 00:16:44,002
For example,
do you have kids?

391
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,037
- No.
- Okay, good.

392
00:16:46,038 --> 00:16:50,275
That's a relief actually.

393
00:16:50,276 --> 00:16:52,444
But if and when you do,
they're fucked.I mean, they're not safe
anywhere, on the playground,

394
00:16:52,445 --> 00:16:54,379
in the schools,
in the restaurants,

395
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,547
in their own bedrooms.

396
00:16:55,548 --> 00:16:57,215
Someone can break in
and take them.

397
00:16:57,216 --> 00:16:58,583
And knowing that they're

398
00:16:58,584 --> 00:17:01,453
perpetually in danger
means that,

399
00:17:01,454 --> 00:17:02,387
you can be liberated.

400
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:04,189
You shouldn't fear anything.

401
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:04,589
I think that's actually
a very healthy attitude.

402
00:17:08,427 --> 00:17:10,528
That's interesting.
That's interesting.

403
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:19,337
Look, I need to
tell you something.

404
00:17:19,338 --> 00:17:20,438
Are you on your period?

405
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:21,706
No, that's not it.

406
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:24,943
I think a lot of what you said
at dinner was way off base.

407
00:17:26,345 --> 00:17:28,146
Really.

408
00:17:29,315 --> 00:17:31,082
Mm-hmm.

409
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:33,718
I'm a optimist.

410
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,720
Well, I've never dated
an eye doctor. So...

411
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:37,822
Not an ophthalmologist,
an optimist.

412
00:17:37,823 --> 00:17:39,591
I think things
are getting better.

413
00:17:39,592 --> 00:17:42,127
I don't think liberty stems
from being scared of everything.

414
00:17:42,128 --> 00:17:43,161
I think liberty results from
empowerment and progress.

415
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:50,101
I agree.

416
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:52,537
Maybe we should liberate
ourselves from our clothes and progress to the
penetration ceremony.

417
00:17:52,538 --> 00:17:55,807
For everything bad that happens,
100 good things happen.

418
00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:58,209
Consciousness is on the rise.

419
00:17:58,210 --> 00:17:58,443
People are less tolerant of war
and human rights violations.

420
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:04,082
They're standing up
to injustices.

421
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,785
They're speaking out
against bullies.

422
00:18:06,786 --> 00:18:09,254
There are people inventing
things in their garages

423
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:11,122
that are going to
change the world.

424
00:18:11,123 --> 00:18:14,459
I think it's an exciting
time to be alive.

425
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:14,693
Wow, you're really
something else.

426
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:21,399
I admire your passion so much.

427
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,734
It's incredible.

428
00:18:22,735 --> 00:18:24,602
But you sound like
a dumbass.

429
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:26,705
- Like one of those
sniveling liberals.
- You're a dick!

430
00:18:26,706 --> 00:18:28,106
You know, it's true.

431
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:31,142
Come on, don't go.
Wait a second.

432
00:18:31,143 --> 00:18:33,545
Look, look, look, look, look.

433
00:18:33,546 --> 00:18:35,513
I'm just being honest, okay.
You can appreciate that.

434
00:18:35,514 --> 00:18:38,116
If this is honesty, then I don't
anything else to do with you.

435
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:41,853
No, no, hold on a second.

436
00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:44,222
You can't take anything
I'm saying seriously. I'm exhausted and confused.

437
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:46,558
What do you have to be
exhausted and confused about?

438
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:49,227
Oh man,
I'm 40 years old.

439
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:51,730
You online profile
said you were 35.

440
00:18:51,731 --> 00:18:54,132
See how confused I am.
I mean...

441
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:54,933
Okay, but when I dye
my hair I look 30.

442
00:18:58,771 --> 00:19:00,572
Look, I think New York
is a magical city,

443
00:19:00,573 --> 00:19:02,907
and I feel very close
to the humanity here.

444
00:19:02,908 --> 00:19:04,709
In fact, I've never been
more optimistic about

445
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:06,611
the human race in my life.

446
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:08,546
A lot of people say
that when you get older,

447
00:19:08,547 --> 00:19:11,182
you get more cynical
but every day, in every way,

448
00:19:11,183 --> 00:19:14,185
I feel like Mary Poppins
on nitrous oxide.

449
00:19:14,186 --> 00:19:16,154
Yes, yes, it's true.
You know, one of the things
I like to do

450
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:17,522
when I want to feel
elbow to elbow

451
00:19:17,523 --> 00:19:19,924
with my brothers
and sisters in the city?

452
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:22,127
I'll ride the subway,
I'm not kidding,

453
00:19:22,128 --> 00:19:23,361
and I'll look for two people,

454
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:26,398
like, the most downtrodden,
depressed people I can find,

455
00:19:26,399 --> 00:19:28,333
I will just sandwich myself.

456
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:29,801
I'll will sit right
between them.

457
00:19:29,802 --> 00:19:33,338
It doesn't matter
who they are.

458
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:35,740
They could be white hipsters,
or Chinese bankers or black bankers,
or Puerto Ricans hipsters...

459
00:19:35,741 --> 00:19:37,909
...or Jews.

460
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:38,743
I'll sit beside them and
I'll put one hand on one thigh

461
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:44,482
and one hand on the other thigh,

462
00:19:44,483 --> 00:19:45,316
just to let them know that we're
all in this thing together.

463
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:51,523
Shut up.
You are ridiculous!

464
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:53,425
Don't patronize me.
I believe this shit.

465
00:19:53,426 --> 00:19:55,560
I feel strongly about this.

466
00:19:55,561 --> 00:19:57,562
Bullshit.

467
00:19:57,563 --> 00:19:59,597
Seriously, fuck you.

468
00:19:59,598 --> 00:20:02,467
Are you telling me you
actually put your hands

469
00:20:02,468 --> 00:20:04,602
on two peoples' thighs
to show them solidarity?

470
00:20:04,603 --> 00:20:07,472
Because if you're serious,
I will marry you right now.

471
00:20:07,473 --> 00:20:08,640
Let's not get carried away,
okay.

472
00:20:08,641 --> 00:20:10,442
I don't know if I'm
marriage material.

473
00:20:10,443 --> 00:20:13,244
But I like your
enthusiasm quite a bit.

474
00:20:13,245 --> 00:20:15,880
I mean,
all things considered,

475
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:19,584
to be clear, I don't know
how I feel about marriage.

476
00:20:19,585 --> 00:20:21,719
No, I know how I feel.
I've been married.

477
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,889
I'm not doing it again.
It's not for everyone.

478
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,257
You were married but

479
00:20:26,258 --> 00:20:27,592
you're against
marriage completely?

480
00:20:27,593 --> 00:20:29,661
You're totally against it, now?

481
00:20:29,662 --> 00:20:30,028
I mean, it's not for everyone.
It's not for me.

482
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,232
Cheers.

483
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:35,700
I think that's really
a healthy attitude.

484
00:20:35,701 --> 00:20:37,435
I think that's a terrifically
healthy attitude.

485
00:20:37,436 --> 00:20:39,003
I'll drink to that.

486
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:40,305
You like it, huh?

487
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:44,742
Try deeper, deeper.

488
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:46,678
I can't go any deeper.

489
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:47,679
Harder. Harder.

490
00:20:49,882 --> 00:20:51,616
I can't go any harder.

491
00:20:51,617 --> 00:20:52,150
Faster.
Try faster.

492
00:20:53,652 --> 00:20:56,254
I can't go any faster.

493
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:59,524
Jesus, try anything.
Just fuck me!

494
00:20:59,525 --> 00:21:01,759
I'm doing the best I can,
okay.

495
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,732
It's good, huh?
You like it?

496
00:21:07,733 --> 00:21:09,667
I'm close.
I'm close.

497
00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:11,002
Okay.

498
00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:16,875
You know I should
probably head home.

499
00:21:16,876 --> 00:21:17,609
Just stay for
a little bit longer.

500
00:21:20,813 --> 00:21:22,947
Um...

501
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:24,282
Please, just little bit longer.

502
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:28,820
Okay, I can stay for
maybe ten more minutes.

503
00:21:28,821 --> 00:21:30,955
Our bodies fit
together so well.

504
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:32,223
Maybe five.

505
00:21:32,224 --> 00:21:35,426
I'm short and chubby so it's
hard for me to find a body type

506
00:21:35,427 --> 00:21:37,328
that meshes with mine.

507
00:21:37,329 --> 00:21:39,731
I really need to go.

508
00:21:39,732 --> 00:21:40,698
You don't like me,
do you?

509
00:21:42,868 --> 00:21:43,801
I thought things were
going so well between us.

510
00:21:45,738 --> 00:21:47,672
You know, the problem is
I only do great sex.

511
00:21:55,781 --> 00:21:58,383
Like, I need great sex.

512
00:21:58,384 --> 00:22:00,485
Good sex
isn't good enough.

513
00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:03,188
We, we had great sex, right?
It felt pretty great.

514
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:06,357
Mm.

515
00:22:08,093 --> 00:22:08,860
Look I'm out of practice, okay?

516
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:13,331
Didn't you say that
you just got out
of a three year relationship?

517
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:14,866
Yeah, so.

518
00:22:14,867 --> 00:22:18,570
So you should be like,
practiced up.

519
00:22:18,571 --> 00:22:20,471
You should be,
you should be...

520
00:22:20,472 --> 00:22:22,340
I don't understand.

521
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:24,842
Look, fucking is difficult.
It's hard, okay.

522
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:26,511
- Fucking is really hard.
- Fucking is hard?

523
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:27,879
Yeah, it's like exercise.

524
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,948
I don't know why they're
trying to outlaw gay marriage.

525
00:22:29,949 --> 00:22:31,716
They should be
outlawing sit-ups.

526
00:22:31,717 --> 00:22:34,085
Oh my God,
that is your problem.

527
00:22:34,086 --> 00:22:35,086
Fucking should be
effortless and awesome!

528
00:22:38,791 --> 00:22:40,425
I can be effortless
and awesome.

529
00:22:40,426 --> 00:22:43,461
No, you can't.
You're robotic and rigid.

530
00:22:43,462 --> 00:22:45,330
I can fuck, okay.

531
00:22:45,331 --> 00:22:46,998
No.

532
00:22:46,999 --> 00:22:48,499
No, you can't.

533
00:22:49,435 --> 00:22:51,970
You know what I hate,

534
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,574
more than anything else,
in the whole entire world? What?

535
00:22:56,575 --> 00:22:59,410
When you're watching a movie

536
00:22:59,411 --> 00:23:01,646
about a bunch of spoiled,
neurotic white people

537
00:23:01,647 --> 00:23:04,983
and then at some point,
a black character shows up

538
00:23:04,984 --> 00:23:07,919
and then the filmmakers
draw attention to the fact

539
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,854
that the character is black.

540
00:23:09,855 --> 00:23:10,822
Yeah.

541
00:23:10,823 --> 00:23:14,058
You're like black, right?

542
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:15,526
Yeah.
I guess so.

543
00:23:15,527 --> 00:23:16,728
I always thought
I wanted to make

544
00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:18,062
a feature film at some point.

545
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:19,897
You know, I always
thought I had it in me,

546
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:23,134
to do that.

547
00:23:23,135 --> 00:23:25,403
I mean, I'm in sales,
but I think if I ever did it I would probably do
the auteur thing.

548
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:26,938
I would write,
direct and star in it,

549
00:23:26,939 --> 00:23:28,439
is what I probably
would end up doing.

550
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,541
Wow, you have a lot of
confidence in yourself.

551
00:23:30,542 --> 00:23:33,144
How hard could it be
at the end of the day?

552
00:23:33,145 --> 00:23:36,814
I mean,
Tyler Perry does that.

553
00:23:36,815 --> 00:23:39,017
He writes and directs and
stars in his own movies. Yeah, but Tyler Perry
is really smart.

554
00:23:39,018 --> 00:23:41,085
He's not that smart though.
Come on.

555
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:42,053
Really?

556
00:23:42,054 --> 00:23:43,788
Come on,
his movies are horrible.

557
00:23:43,789 --> 00:23:46,157
- You know, they're terrible.
- Are they?

558
00:23:46,158 --> 00:23:47,859
You've seen his movies.
You know how bad they are.

559
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:51,462
I've never seen a
Tyler Perry movie. No.

560
00:23:51,463 --> 00:23:52,964
- You've seen a Tyler Perry
movie before.
- No, I haven't. Have you? I would never watch
a Tyler Perry movie.

561
00:23:52,965 --> 00:23:56,167
Why not?

562
00:23:56,168 --> 00:23:57,168
His movies are terrible,
that's why.How can you say
they are terrible

563
00:23:57,169 --> 00:23:58,803
if you've never seen one?

564
00:23:58,804 --> 00:24:01,873
The feeling that you get.

565
00:24:01,874 --> 00:24:05,443
They just look bad.
They just feel bad.

566
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:08,212
I see a trailer for a
Tyler Perry movie and I think,

567
00:24:08,213 --> 00:24:10,181
"It made that much money?

568
00:24:10,182 --> 00:24:11,649
It's making that
kind of money?

569
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:13,451
That's what people
are seeing that?"

570
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:16,120
It just makes me mad.

571
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:17,755
That is really
presumptuous of you to criticize a
filmmaker's movies

572
00:24:17,756 --> 00:24:19,057
and you've never
seen their movies.

573
00:24:19,058 --> 00:24:20,792
Tyler Perry is
incredibly successful.

574
00:24:20,793 --> 00:24:22,660
He's got to be doing
some right.

575
00:24:22,661 --> 00:24:23,027
Right?

576
00:24:24,163 --> 00:24:26,964
You should probably
stop eating so much bread,

577
00:24:28,834 --> 00:24:30,568
to be honest.

578
00:24:30,569 --> 00:24:32,770
So, um...have you ever
dated a black guy?

579
00:24:36,909 --> 00:24:39,477
What do you want, Erik?

580
00:24:40,579 --> 00:24:41,979
I want to get back together.

581
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,314
No.

582
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:47,685
What do you mean?

583
00:24:47,686 --> 00:24:50,488
Does that mean like,
"No. Forever no",or just "no temporarily
but maybe later we'll
get back together." Erik, you're abusive
and dangerous

584
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:52,890
and if you don't
stop calling me,

585
00:24:52,891 --> 00:24:55,159
I'm going to take out a
restraining order against you.

586
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,961
Look, you're the
unstable one, okay.

587
00:24:56,962 --> 00:24:58,496
The only reason I want
to get back together is

588
00:24:58,497 --> 00:24:59,697
because I'm worried about you.

589
00:24:59,698 --> 00:25:01,132
I just want to make sure
that you're fine,

590
00:25:01,133 --> 00:25:03,901
that you're not going to
do something psychotic,

591
00:25:03,902 --> 00:25:05,636
- or suicidal or something.
- Get over yourself.

592
00:25:05,637 --> 00:25:08,239
You're like a forty-year-old
man who's a child,

593
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,808
who's going to die
afraid and alone.

594
00:25:10,809 --> 00:25:10,975
Look, for your information I've
been on three dates this month.

595
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:17,115
Fantastic, you're a stud.

596
00:25:17,116 --> 00:25:19,717
- Well, I am one for three.
- Goodbye, Erik.

597
00:25:19,718 --> 00:25:21,052
Look, hold on.
Don't hang up the phone.

598
00:25:21,053 --> 00:25:23,254
I want to ask you
one more question

599
00:25:23,255 --> 00:25:23,755
and then I'll leave you
alone, okay.

600
00:25:25,791 --> 00:25:27,125
- Jody?
- What?

601
00:25:28,293 --> 00:25:31,162
- Are you there?
- What?

602
00:25:31,163 --> 00:25:33,631
Was the sex bad?

603
00:25:33,632 --> 00:25:35,166
What do you mean?

604
00:25:35,167 --> 00:25:38,202
I mean, did we have...during the
three years we were together,

605
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:38,836
was the sex bad,
between us?

606
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:45,710
Erik, it was way worse
than that.

607
00:25:45,711 --> 00:25:46,944
I don't believe you.

608
00:25:46,945 --> 00:25:50,248
Do you know how I keep dry
when it's hot and humid outside?

609
00:25:50,249 --> 00:25:53,084
- How?
- I think of you!

610
00:25:53,085 --> 00:25:55,553
You're just....

611
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:59,023
I would rather mount a chainsaw,
than be with you again.

612
00:25:59,024 --> 00:26:00,291
Okay, that's not nice.

613
00:26:00,292 --> 00:26:00,525
My sixty-five-year-old neighbor
has more stamina than you do

614
00:26:03,862 --> 00:26:06,097
and he has MS.

615
00:26:06,098 --> 00:26:08,699
Oh, you're having sex
with old Mr. Phillips now?

616
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,935
Well, that would at least
be an improvement.

617
00:26:10,936 --> 00:26:12,203
Well, it wouldn't surprise me.

618
00:26:12,204 --> 00:26:16,007
I know you're having sex with
that frat boy motherfucker.

619
00:26:19,311 --> 00:26:21,045
Jody?

620
00:26:21,046 --> 00:26:24,582
Hey, I didn't mean that.

621
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:26,784
It's good you're
having sex with him.

622
00:26:26,785 --> 00:26:28,286
Are you there?

623
00:26:28,287 --> 00:26:30,254
Penelope.
What's up, girl?

624
00:26:32,224 --> 00:26:33,591
Yes.

625
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:37,261
You look very pretty today.

626
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:40,097
I think you shouldn't say
that to your co-worker.

627
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:41,599
Why not?

628
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,900
It's kind of creepy.

629
00:26:42,901 --> 00:26:44,268
I'm not groping you, okay.

630
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:46,137
I'm just paying you
a complement.

631
00:26:46,138 --> 00:26:49,140
Yeah, but you know how
serious they are here

632
00:26:49,141 --> 00:26:51,342
about sexual harassment.

633
00:26:51,343 --> 00:26:53,077
If you said I was handsome,

634
00:26:53,078 --> 00:26:55,179
I wouldn't freaked out
about that.

635
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,981
Look, I have to go
finish my work.

636
00:26:56,982 --> 00:26:58,749
Why?
You're always working so hard.

637
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:00,351
Why are you constantly working?

638
00:27:00,352 --> 00:27:02,787
We have a huge
meeting tomorrow,

639
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:05,690
and I have to finish
my spreadsheets.

640
00:27:05,691 --> 00:27:07,692
Don't you hate this job?

641
00:27:07,693 --> 00:27:09,360
- No.
- Really?

642
00:27:09,361 --> 00:27:10,962
It seems like there's
more to life

643
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:11,362
than being some cog in
a money-making machine.

644
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:17,001
I like making money.

645
00:27:17,002 --> 00:27:19,170
Yeah, but don't you just feel
like we're all just characters

646
00:27:19,171 --> 00:27:21,639
in a Dilbert cartoon?

647
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,374
I don't know that cartoon.

648
00:27:23,375 --> 00:27:26,077
Wouldn't you rather be
a character in a movie,

649
00:27:26,078 --> 00:27:29,213
like "Deep Throat"
or something like that?

650
00:27:29,214 --> 00:27:32,083
Did you not hear
everything I just said

651
00:27:32,084 --> 00:27:34,085
about sexual harassment?

652
00:27:34,086 --> 00:27:35,820
Okay, I'm not meaning
it as sexual harassment.

653
00:27:35,821 --> 00:27:38,689
It's just a word, Penelope.

654
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:39,457
Yeah, but it's a dirty word.

655
00:27:42,928 --> 00:27:43,594
Do you like dirty words?

656
00:27:46,899 --> 00:27:50,735
Not at work.

657
00:27:50,736 --> 00:27:53,871
You better finish
your spreadsheets.

658
00:27:56,909 --> 00:27:58,776
Oh yeah, I like it.

659
00:27:59,878 --> 00:28:02,113
No, I'm in here.

660
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:07,451
Yeah, I'll be out
in a second, okay?

661
00:28:45,424 --> 00:28:46,724
Hey, what's up?

662
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:48,292
Hi.

663
00:28:48,293 --> 00:28:50,928
May I join you?

664
00:28:50,929 --> 00:28:52,897
Sure.

665
00:28:52,898 --> 00:28:53,598
You're not going to mug me
or anything like that, are you?

666
00:28:56,768 --> 00:28:57,735
No.

667
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:59,770
Have you ever been mugged?

668
00:28:59,771 --> 00:29:02,340
Well, I have this defense
mechanism that I use

669
00:29:02,341 --> 00:29:05,409
when I think there's a
dangerous situation.

670
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,411
If I'm walking by two people

671
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:10,047
or one person who might look
shady or dangerous,

672
00:29:10,048 --> 00:29:12,483
I'll start tweaking out
and saying gibberish,

673
00:29:12,484 --> 00:29:14,952
like I've got brain damage,
so they think I'm fucked up.

674
00:29:14,953 --> 00:29:17,188
So I'll say stuff like,
"I'll blow shit up,

675
00:29:17,189 --> 00:29:18,956
tomatoes, tomatoes,
momma didn't love me,

676
00:29:18,957 --> 00:29:19,924
give me my
prosthetic leg,

677
00:29:19,925 --> 00:29:21,425
Charlie, bang-bang,
Charlie, bang-bang."

678
00:29:22,494 --> 00:29:25,396
It's...to freak them out,
you know what I mean,

679
00:29:27,032 --> 00:29:28,432
so they won't fuck with me.

680
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:30,801
Oh yeah, that's funny.

681
00:29:30,802 --> 00:29:33,137
- It's pretty stupid.
- Does it work?

682
00:29:33,138 --> 00:29:34,372
I mean, it works.

683
00:29:34,373 --> 00:29:35,473
It's dumb I know,

684
00:29:35,474 --> 00:29:37,074
but I do it
when I was scared

685
00:29:37,075 --> 00:29:38,442
and we do dumb things
when we're scared.

686
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:39,977
We do dumb things
when we're scared.

687
00:29:39,978 --> 00:29:42,513
Every dumb political decision
we ever made

688
00:29:42,514 --> 00:29:43,748
was when we were scared.

689
00:29:43,749 --> 00:29:45,816
- Every dumb political
decision we ever made
- Yeah.

690
00:29:45,817 --> 00:29:47,752
was kinda...stupid so...

691
00:29:47,753 --> 00:29:48,085
Are you afraid of
anything right now?

692
00:29:50,422 --> 00:29:51,522
I am actually, yeah.

693
00:29:59,031 --> 00:29:59,830
God, you've got beautiful eyes.

694
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,100
Thank you.

695
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:05,770
I'm not trying to
come on to you
or give you a hand job

696
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:11,175
or anything like that.
I'm just saying,
"Wow wee."

697
00:30:11,176 --> 00:30:13,444
Tell me about your fears.

698
00:30:17,983 --> 00:30:18,683
I think I'm losing my mind.

699
00:30:20,419 --> 00:30:21,852
Why?

700
00:30:23,855 --> 00:30:26,357
Because this city's insane.

701
00:30:26,358 --> 00:30:27,858
I'm insane.

702
00:30:27,859 --> 00:30:28,959
I don't know what I'm doing.

703
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,194
I don't know where I'm going.

704
00:30:30,195 --> 00:30:32,596
I can't commit to
anyone or anything.

705
00:30:32,597 --> 00:30:34,865
I'm afraid someone's
going to blow up this city.

706
00:30:34,866 --> 00:30:37,902
I'm afraid of middle eastern
men wearing backpacks,

707
00:30:37,903 --> 00:30:39,303
even though I'm sometimes
a middle eastern man

708
00:30:39,304 --> 00:30:41,238
- who wears a backpack.
- Uh-huh.

709
00:30:41,239 --> 00:30:43,207
I'm afraid I'm unraveling.

710
00:30:43,208 --> 00:30:46,177
I'm afraid that my HPV is
going to lead to throat cancer.

711
00:30:46,178 --> 00:30:48,112
I'm afraid of Michael Douglas.

712
00:30:48,113 --> 00:30:50,414
Have you seen him lately?

713
00:30:50,415 --> 00:30:51,949
I'm afraid of everything!

714
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:54,218
Are you afraid to die?

715
00:30:54,219 --> 00:30:56,053
I'm terrified.

716
00:30:56,054 --> 00:30:58,255
Do you want to die?

717
00:30:58,256 --> 00:31:02,026
That's the thing, I don't
really care if I die or not.

718
00:31:02,027 --> 00:31:05,062
I think it would alleviate
a lot of responsibilities.

719
00:31:05,063 --> 00:31:07,465
What kind of responsibilities?

720
00:31:07,466 --> 00:31:10,468
You know, career,
making something of myself,

721
00:31:10,469 --> 00:31:12,169
starting a family.

722
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:14,538
If I died I wouldn't
have to grow old,

723
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:17,108
I wouldn't have to grow-up.

724
00:31:17,109 --> 00:31:19,176
Do you want to die?

725
00:31:19,177 --> 00:31:21,011
That's the thing,
I don't know--

726
00:31:21,012 --> 00:31:23,347
- Do you want to die?
- I don't care, I think..

727
00:31:23,348 --> 00:31:25,549
- Do you want to die?
- Yeah, I do want to die.

728
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,118
You do want to die.

729
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:28,119
I do.

730
00:32:35,153 --> 00:32:36,187
How long has he
been like this?

731
00:32:36,188 --> 00:32:38,422
All day!

732
00:32:38,423 --> 00:32:39,957
Erik.

733
00:32:43,028 --> 00:32:44,595
Erik!

734
00:32:44,596 --> 00:32:45,329
Do I help you?
Can I know you?

735
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:49,333
You missed the meeting.

736
00:32:49,334 --> 00:32:50,701
What meeting?

737
00:32:50,702 --> 00:32:52,136
There was a meeting
this morning.

738
00:32:52,137 --> 00:32:54,205
You missed it.

739
00:32:54,206 --> 00:32:57,074
I don't know about
any meeting.

740
00:32:57,075 --> 00:32:59,643
Carl is fucking pissed.

741
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:02,713
Well, Carl can kiss
my big red weenie

742
00:33:02,714 --> 00:33:05,182
until his lips are coated
with the sweat of my--

743
00:33:05,183 --> 00:33:07,618
Carl, what's up buddy?
We were just talking about you.

744
00:33:07,619 --> 00:33:08,853
The nicest,
sweetest things

745
00:33:08,854 --> 00:33:12,389
about how exponentially great
you are for this company.

746
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:13,757
You missed the meeting today.

747
00:33:13,758 --> 00:33:16,093
I know I missed the meeting.

748
00:33:16,094 --> 00:33:18,028
I missed meeting.

749
00:33:18,029 --> 00:33:18,262
I don't know what to tell you
but this should say it all.

750
00:33:21,733 --> 00:33:24,201
I'm just kidding around.

751
00:33:24,202 --> 00:33:25,970
Look, here's the thing,
I wasn't there because I was
trimming my pubic hair.

752
00:33:25,971 --> 00:33:27,371
The thing is I wasn't there

753
00:33:27,372 --> 00:33:29,707
because I had this thing
lodged in my asshole...

754
00:33:29,708 --> 00:33:32,710
What the fuck
is wrong with him?

755
00:33:32,711 --> 00:33:34,612
I have no idea.

756
00:33:34,613 --> 00:33:35,546
Would you get over to my
office for a minute, please?

757
00:33:37,282 --> 00:33:39,316
It sounds like
you're in big trouble.

758
00:33:40,752 --> 00:33:44,688
I'm in big trouble,
big trouble.

759
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:45,723
Yeah, well, I've been to the
principal's office before. I can take it.

760
00:33:45,724 --> 00:33:48,192
Well, Erik it's going
to be sad to see you go.

761
00:33:48,193 --> 00:33:49,393
if this is the last time
I see you,

762
00:33:49,394 --> 00:33:50,794
I want to wish you
the best of luck.

763
00:33:50,795 --> 00:33:52,663
And if you decide to come
back here in a few hours

764
00:33:52,664 --> 00:33:54,098
with a loaded shotgun,

765
00:33:54,099 --> 00:33:56,400
just remember,
I was always here to help.

766
00:33:56,401 --> 00:33:58,636
Okay?
Have a great day!

767
00:34:03,141 --> 00:34:04,875
Penelope,
can I ask you a question?

768
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:05,709
Hmm?

769
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:08,412
Has Carl ever touched you

770
00:34:08,413 --> 00:34:10,347
- physically or inappropriately?
- No!

771
00:34:10,348 --> 00:34:12,249
- Are you sure?
- Yeah!

772
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:15,319
Okay, if I accused him of
sexually assaulting you,

773
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,687
would you back me
up on that?

774
00:34:16,688 --> 00:34:18,222
No!

775
00:34:18,223 --> 00:34:20,257
There'd be a big payday,
a big payout for you.

776
00:34:20,258 --> 00:34:21,625
- It would be good money.
- No.

777
00:34:21,626 --> 00:34:23,127
- Are you sure?
- No.

778
00:34:23,128 --> 00:34:25,729
Okay, if I accused him
of sexually assaulting me,

779
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:27,097
would you back me
up on that?

780
00:34:27,098 --> 00:34:28,632
No!

781
00:34:28,633 --> 00:34:31,268
Alright.

782
00:34:31,269 --> 00:34:34,605
Well, if I get terminated,
will you miss me?

783
00:34:34,606 --> 00:34:35,372
Maybe a little.

784
00:34:37,208 --> 00:34:38,642
Thank you.

785
00:34:40,445 --> 00:34:42,713
Have you looked at yourself
in the mirror today?

786
00:34:44,482 --> 00:34:45,849
I'm not a vain person Carl,

787
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:47,451
so I don't do that
kind of thing.

788
00:34:47,452 --> 00:34:48,719
So, no.

789
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:51,822
Well you look like Godzilla
used your shirt as a maxi pad.

790
00:34:51,823 --> 00:34:55,459
Okay, that's all well and good

791
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:58,462
but I'm pretty sure saying
the word "maxi pad"in front of an employee
is sexual harassment.

792
00:34:58,463 --> 00:34:59,463
So you're fucked.

793
00:34:59,464 --> 00:35:02,299
Just do me a favor.
Pack your shit and go.

794
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:03,467
You firing me right now

795
00:35:03,468 --> 00:35:05,302
is the best thing that's
ever happened to me.

796
00:35:05,303 --> 00:35:07,838
Profits, money, spreadsheets.

797
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:10,274
I've got your fucking
spreadsheet right here.

798
00:35:10,275 --> 00:35:11,642
You want to see a spreadsheet?

799
00:35:11,643 --> 00:35:15,346
Let me show you a
fucking spreadsheet.

800
00:35:19,517 --> 00:35:21,652
Here's your fucking
spreadsheet, right here.

801
00:35:21,653 --> 00:35:23,854
Chew on that.

802
00:37:12,597 --> 00:37:15,532
Hey, excuse me.
Hey, excuse me.

803
00:37:15,533 --> 00:37:15,799
Can I buy a cigarette
from you for a dollar?

804
00:37:19,404 --> 00:37:21,538
I have a dollar in my pocket.

805
00:37:21,539 --> 00:37:22,906
You can just have it.

806
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:24,708
Oh, you're very nice.

807
00:37:27,812 --> 00:37:29,346
All right?

808
00:37:29,347 --> 00:37:30,447
Oh, god.
This is terrible.

809
00:37:32,383 --> 00:37:34,418
Why do you smoke
these things?

810
00:37:34,419 --> 00:37:35,786
Oh.

811
00:37:35,787 --> 00:37:37,488
Oh my God!

812
00:37:37,489 --> 00:37:39,656
I've got to go, man.

813
00:37:39,657 --> 00:37:42,392
Hold on a second,
wait a minute. Do you have a Tums?

814
00:37:42,393 --> 00:37:44,962
Man, my stomach is killing me.
Do you have a... No, I don't, man.
Sorry, my family is waiting.

815
00:37:44,963 --> 00:37:47,297
- You've got a family?
- Yeah.

816
00:37:47,298 --> 00:37:48,532
Is it a nice, good family?

817
00:37:48,533 --> 00:37:49,399
Goodbye!

818
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,635
Like the Manson family,
good family?

819
00:37:51,636 --> 00:37:54,338
Oh God...

820
00:38:10,655 --> 00:38:12,022
Ow.
Oh God.

821
00:38:12,023 --> 00:38:12,723
Are you all right?

822
00:38:12,724 --> 00:38:14,458
Oh no, I'm not.

823
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:14,691
My stomach is
fucking killing me.

824
00:38:17,862 --> 00:38:18,929
Oh.

825
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:20,597
You should go get it
checked out or something.

826
00:38:20,598 --> 00:38:23,033
No shit. Yeah, I should go
to a doctor probably.

827
00:38:23,034 --> 00:38:26,737
Yeah, it could be like,
stomach cancer.

828
00:38:26,738 --> 00:38:28,672
You've got a lot of nerve
talking about cancer,

829
00:38:28,673 --> 00:38:31,275
while you're
smoking a cigarette.

830
00:38:31,276 --> 00:38:33,010
It's not a cigarette.

831
00:38:33,011 --> 00:38:33,977
Weed,

832
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:35,779
the shit they give you
if you have cancer

833
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:37,948
to ease all the pain.

834
00:38:37,949 --> 00:38:39,650
You want some?

835
00:38:39,651 --> 00:38:40,984
- No.
- No?

836
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:43,520
But your neck....

837
00:38:43,521 --> 00:38:46,023
I wouldn't mind
having a bite out of that.

838
00:38:46,024 --> 00:38:47,891
Have you been doing some
bath salts or something, buddy?

839
00:38:47,892 --> 00:38:49,927
No, I just want a
little bit of that.

840
00:38:49,928 --> 00:38:51,395
Wait a second.
Can I ask you question?

841
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:56,600
Can I ask you a question?

842
00:38:56,601 --> 00:38:59,069
Hey, don't--
Come back here.

843
00:39:14,752 --> 00:39:16,320
Oh God that's...
That's delicious.

844
00:39:18,656 --> 00:39:19,590
I'm sorry.

845
00:39:21,059 --> 00:39:21,391
I'm sorry.

846
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:24,428
I'm sorry about that.

847
00:39:24,429 --> 00:39:24,728
I'm sorry but it's so good.

848
00:39:28,333 --> 00:39:29,299
I can't tell you how sorry I am.

849
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:33,203
I'm sorry.

850
00:39:34,472 --> 00:39:36,940
You look like
such a nice boy too.

851
00:39:41,012 --> 00:39:43,080
Were you a student?

852
00:39:43,081 --> 00:39:44,448
Yeah, what did you study?

853
00:39:45,817 --> 00:39:47,918
I didn't stay in school.

854
00:39:49,621 --> 00:39:50,554
You didn't stay in school?

855
00:39:50,555 --> 00:39:52,756
- I didn't finish.
- You didn't finish?

856
00:39:52,757 --> 00:39:57,861
No!

857
00:39:57,862 --> 00:40:05,862
That's what you get for
not getting your education.

858
00:40:53,718 --> 00:40:54,951
Thanks for agreeing
to come back

859
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:56,420
and have dinner with me again.

860
00:40:56,421 --> 00:40:58,922
I appreciate that, thanks.

861
00:40:58,923 --> 00:40:59,089
Yeah, I believe
in second changes.

862
00:41:02,994 --> 00:41:05,062
Yeah, there's so much
bleakness in the world,

863
00:41:05,063 --> 00:41:06,430
so much tragedy.

864
00:41:06,431 --> 00:41:07,698
No, I totally understand.

865
00:41:07,699 --> 00:41:09,933
There's a lot to be
depressed about.

866
00:41:09,934 --> 00:41:12,502
It was getting to me
but I think I'm over it now.

867
00:41:12,503 --> 00:41:13,570
You know, I wanted to show
you that I'm a decent person,

868
00:41:17,108 --> 00:41:18,942
I think, in a lot of ways.

869
00:41:18,943 --> 00:41:20,777
- This is who you really are.
- This is who I am.

870
00:41:20,778 --> 00:41:22,512
Yeah, so...

871
00:41:22,513 --> 00:41:23,447
You seem like a good guy.
I knew you were a good guy.

872
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:28,085
I'm all right.

873
00:41:28,086 --> 00:41:31,221
You know, I feel
pretty strong these days.

874
00:41:31,222 --> 00:41:33,023
Yeah, absolutely.

875
00:41:33,024 --> 00:41:36,626
Hey, you sure you don't
want anything to eat?

876
00:41:36,627 --> 00:41:38,995
No, I'll have something later.

877
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:44,701
Oh God.

878
00:41:44,702 --> 00:41:45,902
Yeah.

879
00:41:45,903 --> 00:41:48,271
Oh, Oh.

880
00:42:07,158 --> 00:42:10,160
What did you do to me?

881
00:42:10,161 --> 00:42:12,062
That felt so good.

882
00:42:12,063 --> 00:42:15,232
Yeah, it did. Oh man.

883
00:42:15,233 --> 00:42:16,566
You want to do it again?

884
00:42:16,567 --> 00:42:18,168
- Yes!
- Yeah.

885
00:42:26,244 --> 00:42:28,812
Listen to me for a second.

886
00:42:28,813 --> 00:42:30,647
I can fuck.

887
00:42:30,648 --> 00:42:31,515
I really can.
I...like, I can fuck.

888
00:42:33,851 --> 00:42:35,852
Sure you can.

889
00:42:35,853 --> 00:42:38,622
Listen, I was having a bad
night last time.

890
00:42:38,623 --> 00:42:40,056
I strained my back

891
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:42,926
and I just had some personal
issues to deal with.

892
00:42:42,927 --> 00:42:46,129
But now,
I'm like Zeus, Adonis,

893
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:46,530
God, Greek gods, you know
whatever the God of Sex is,

894
00:42:50,101 --> 00:42:51,368
God of Sex.
God of Sex.

895
00:42:53,204 --> 00:42:54,905
You are exactly the same.

896
00:42:58,109 --> 00:42:59,042
I mean, exactly.

897
00:42:59,043 --> 00:43:01,611
You brought me to
the same restaurant.

898
00:43:01,612 --> 00:43:02,913
How lame is that?

899
00:43:02,914 --> 00:43:05,749
And it's completely dead.

900
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:05,882
And you're not even drinking.
I'm drinking alone.

901
00:43:09,921 --> 00:43:15,125
I'll have a drink later
after I show you a thing or two.

902
00:43:24,869 --> 00:43:26,937
Uh...that was incredible.

903
00:43:32,977 --> 00:43:34,978
Yeah, it's amazing
what you can do with

904
00:43:34,979 --> 00:43:36,379
a five and half inch dick.

905
00:43:37,114 --> 00:43:39,783
It, it's...uh-huh.

906
00:43:42,854 --> 00:43:45,055
I told you it would get better.

907
00:43:45,056 --> 00:43:45,889
I...did not expect that.

908
00:43:50,094 --> 00:43:52,062
Yeah, right.

909
00:43:52,063 --> 00:43:54,164
You want to go again?

910
00:43:54,165 --> 00:43:55,265
Can you?

911
00:43:55,266 --> 00:43:58,034
Yes, sure, of course.
Absolutely!

912
00:43:58,035 --> 00:43:58,535
Hey, you want to try
something a little crazy?

913
00:44:02,373 --> 00:44:04,708
Sure, what is it?
What do you want to do?

914
00:44:04,709 --> 00:44:06,109
Have you ever choked anyone?

915
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:11,615
No.
Like, during sex?

916
00:44:11,616 --> 00:44:12,482
- Yeah.
- Really?

917
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:14,384
No, I've never done that before.

918
00:44:14,385 --> 00:44:14,985
I like feeling pressure
on my neck while we fuck.

919
00:44:18,189 --> 00:44:19,856
Really?

920
00:44:19,857 --> 00:44:23,026
Do you actually want to try
something crazier than that?

921
00:44:23,027 --> 00:44:24,861
- Uh-huh.
- Okay.

922
00:44:43,414 --> 00:44:45,015
You're not eating?

923
00:44:45,016 --> 00:44:46,349
No.

924
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:48,118
Are you on a diet
or something?

925
00:44:48,119 --> 00:44:52,122
No.

926
00:44:52,123 --> 00:44:54,691
- Do you think I should be on a
diet or something like that?
- I don't know. - Is that what you're saying?
- I don't know.

927
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:56,493
I like that.
I like that you're like,
"I don't know."

928
00:44:56,494 --> 00:44:58,261
Most people are like,
"No, you're fine.

929
00:44:58,262 --> 00:45:01,298
Your body's fine,"
but like, "I don't know."

930
00:45:01,299 --> 00:45:04,000
Well, you called me fat,
last time!

931
00:45:04,001 --> 00:45:05,702
- Did I?
- More or less.

932
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:07,237
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to do that.

933
00:45:07,238 --> 00:45:08,438
I apologize.

934
00:45:08,439 --> 00:45:10,206
I was rude.

935
00:45:10,207 --> 00:45:12,976
Yeah, well, you're
doing better tonight.

936
00:45:12,977 --> 00:45:15,946
Yeah, that's cool.

937
00:45:20,718 --> 00:45:22,185
Ooh, baby.

938
00:45:22,186 --> 00:45:23,954
Oh my God.

939
00:45:29,794 --> 00:45:30,794
Oh my God,
that was great.

940
00:45:33,998 --> 00:45:37,033
Oh shit!

941
00:45:45,376 --> 00:45:48,044
It's a beautiful day.

942
00:45:48,045 --> 00:45:49,012
What are you doing?
Stop it!

943
00:45:49,013 --> 00:45:50,180
What are you doing?

944
00:45:50,181 --> 00:45:52,315
Put it back up!
What are you doing?

945
00:45:52,316 --> 00:45:54,317
- Put the curtain back up!
- All right, all right.

946
00:45:54,318 --> 00:45:56,252
Put them up!

947
00:45:56,253 --> 00:45:57,387
- Put it up!
- Okay.

948
00:45:57,388 --> 00:45:59,823
- Put it back up!
- Okay. I'm trying.

949
00:45:59,824 --> 00:46:01,758
Put it up!

950
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:03,159
- Put it up!
- I am.

951
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:05,228
Put it up!
I'm burning!

952
00:46:05,229 --> 00:46:07,964
I feel like my skin is
melting off my dick!

953
00:46:07,965 --> 00:46:09,432
- I'm getting out of here.
- What are you doing?

954
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:10,967
- Put it up!
- You're scaring me!

955
00:46:10,968 --> 00:46:12,869
- What are you doing?
- I've got to go to work!

956
00:46:12,870 --> 00:46:14,504
No, look!

957
00:46:14,505 --> 00:46:16,072
No, wait! Hold on.

958
00:46:16,073 --> 00:46:17,407
Wait a second.

959
00:46:17,408 --> 00:46:18,575
Stop, just don't go.

960
00:46:18,576 --> 00:46:20,777
I've got to go to work.
Don't you have to go to work?

961
00:46:20,778 --> 00:46:21,878
Look, I'm sorry.

962
00:46:21,879 --> 00:46:24,414
Look, okay, don't go.
Look, I'm sorry.

963
00:46:24,415 --> 00:46:26,082
Stay please.
Cuddle with me, please.

964
00:46:26,083 --> 00:46:27,417
I hope you didn't
give me anything,

965
00:46:27,418 --> 00:46:29,252
because we didn't use
a condom last night.

966
00:46:29,253 --> 00:46:30,053
Okay, there is one thing maybe,
one little tiny thing.

967
00:46:33,958 --> 00:46:37,127
You may feel the urge
to bite someone later,

968
00:46:37,128 --> 00:46:39,095
and draw blood, maybe.

969
00:46:39,096 --> 00:46:40,830
But if you do,
just kind of go with it, okay.

970
00:46:40,831 --> 00:46:43,066
You are really weird.

971
00:46:43,067 --> 00:46:45,368
I don't know where you work.

972
00:46:45,369 --> 00:46:47,337
I work at Chase Manhattan bank.
Where's my purse?

973
00:46:47,338 --> 00:46:50,106
Okay, well you might want to see
if they'll let you work nights.

974
00:46:50,107 --> 00:46:51,408
Yeah, right.

975
00:46:51,409 --> 00:46:54,077
I'm not kidding.
I'm dead serious here.

976
00:46:54,078 --> 00:46:55,512
- I've got to go.
- Okay, I'll see you later.

977
00:46:55,513 --> 00:46:56,813
Bye-bye

978
00:47:02,386 --> 00:47:03,953
Thank you.

979
00:47:11,028 --> 00:47:13,096
Mr. Sparrow, it's Leiberman.

980
00:47:13,097 --> 00:47:14,297
Who?

981
00:47:14,298 --> 00:47:16,232
Leiberman, your landlord.

982
00:47:16,233 --> 00:47:17,400
Mr. Leiberman?

983
00:47:17,401 --> 00:47:18,802
Mr. Leiberman, yes.

984
00:47:18,803 --> 00:47:20,570
Mr. Leiberman,
can you come back tonight?

985
00:47:20,571 --> 00:47:22,472
No, I need to talk to you now,
please, Mr. Sparrow.

986
00:47:22,473 --> 00:47:24,307
Come back tonight,
Mr. Leiberman!

987
00:47:24,308 --> 00:47:27,410
Mr. Sparrow, need to talk
to you now, please.

988
00:47:27,411 --> 00:47:28,578
Can you come back tonight?

989
00:47:28,579 --> 00:47:30,113
Please come to the door,
Mr. Sparrow.

990
00:47:30,114 --> 00:47:31,481
Please come back tonight!

991
00:47:31,482 --> 00:47:33,550
I need to collect the rent,
Mr. Sparrow.

992
00:47:33,551 --> 00:47:35,151
Goddamnit!

993
00:47:35,152 --> 00:47:37,187
Oh fuck!

994
00:47:40,291 --> 00:47:41,257
What is it?

995
00:47:41,258 --> 00:47:43,560
I need to collect the rent,
Mr. Sparrow.

996
00:47:43,561 --> 00:47:47,397
What rent?
What are you talking about?

997
00:47:47,398 --> 00:47:50,433
The rent, Mr. Sparrow.
Your rent, it's very late. It's the first time.

998
00:47:50,434 --> 00:47:52,435
We haven't had
this problem before,but I need to collect the rent.

999
00:47:52,436 --> 00:47:54,237
Okay, give me a second, okay.

1000
00:47:54,238 --> 00:47:55,472
- Okay.
- Okay, just hold on!

1001
00:47:55,473 --> 00:47:56,639
Goddamnit!

1002
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:57,907
Fuck!
Oh God, its hot as shit!

1003
00:48:01,178 --> 00:48:02,912
It burns!

1004
00:48:07,918 --> 00:48:08,585
Global warming fucking sucks!

1005
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:12,322
Come back tomorrow,
Mr. Leiberman!!!

1006
00:48:14,258 --> 00:48:18,328
Mr. Sparrow, I need to
talk to you right now!

1007
00:48:18,329 --> 00:48:22,098
I know, the rent, it can
wait one more 24-hour period!

1008
00:48:22,099 --> 00:48:24,534
I'll put five percent
on it extra, fuck!

1009
00:48:24,535 --> 00:48:27,303
Mr. Sparrow,
please open the door!

1010
00:48:27,304 --> 00:48:29,205
We need to talk now,
Mr. Sparrow!

1011
00:48:29,206 --> 00:48:32,208
Okay, I'm coming!

1012
00:48:33,544 --> 00:48:35,612
God, rent, money!

1013
00:48:38,416 --> 00:48:38,948
It's all about money!

1014
00:48:42,153 --> 00:48:43,953
Fuck!

1015
00:48:48,659 --> 00:48:50,560
This door knob needs to be
fixed, Mr. Leiberman.

1016
00:48:50,561 --> 00:48:51,461
I haven't said
anything about it

1017
00:48:51,462 --> 00:48:54,597
because I didn't want
to trouble you.

1018
00:48:54,598 --> 00:48:56,766
Come here, come here.
I want you to look
at me for second

1019
00:48:56,767 --> 00:48:58,468
so we can talk about
the rent,

1020
00:48:58,469 --> 00:49:00,203
because that's why you're here,
to talk about the rent.

1021
00:49:00,204 --> 00:49:03,973
- Ok, I understand.
- Yes.

1022
00:49:03,974 --> 00:49:05,408
I need to collect the rent,
Mr. Sparrow. Yes, yes.

1023
00:49:05,409 --> 00:49:07,243
Oh that.
Yeah, don't worry about that.

1024
00:49:07,244 --> 00:49:09,012
I have really bad back acne,

1025
00:49:09,013 --> 00:49:10,947
so when I lie down
to go to sleep,

1026
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:11,681
it's like bubble wrap.

1027
00:49:11,682 --> 00:49:15,985
It's like, "Pop, pop!"

1028
00:49:15,986 --> 00:49:17,187
Instead of the bubbles
being filled with air, they're filled
with blood and pus.

1029
00:49:17,188 --> 00:49:18,988
But that's not what
you want to talk about.

1030
00:49:18,989 --> 00:49:21,357
- You want to talk about the
rent and I'm okay with that.
- It's the rent.

1031
00:49:21,358 --> 00:49:23,426
I'm very concerned, Mr. Sparrow.
- I know you're concerned,

1032
00:49:23,427 --> 00:49:25,361
but look at me very carefully
right now as I tell you this.

1033
00:49:25,362 --> 00:49:26,629
Right now, because--
No, no, look at me.

1034
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:28,097
There is no rent, right.

1035
00:49:28,098 --> 00:49:28,998
There's not going
to be any rent.

1036
00:49:28,999 --> 00:49:31,000
The rent does not exist.

1037
00:49:31,001 --> 00:49:33,002
I don't understand.

1038
00:49:33,003 --> 00:49:35,271
Okay,
look at me for a second.

1039
00:49:35,272 --> 00:49:37,340
We live in a venal world,
I understand that.

1040
00:49:37,341 --> 00:49:39,375
It's a world were people
like me judge people like you,

1041
00:49:39,376 --> 00:49:41,277
for being the way that you are
and looking the way that you do

1042
00:49:41,278 --> 00:49:43,313
and believing the things
that you believe.

1043
00:49:43,314 --> 00:49:44,647
- It's okay.
- I don't understand.

1044
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:46,616
I'm talking about
judgment here, okay.

1045
00:49:46,617 --> 00:49:48,451
I judge you,
you judge me.

1046
00:49:48,452 --> 00:49:50,587
I will never judge you,
Mr. Sparrow,

1047
00:49:50,588 --> 00:49:52,155
as long as you pay the rent.

1048
00:49:52,156 --> 00:49:54,090
Yeah, I know because
you've got to pay your bills.

1049
00:49:54,091 --> 00:49:55,291
I'm sure you do.

1050
00:49:55,292 --> 00:49:58,161
But you could take care of
your family without my rent.

1051
00:49:58,162 --> 00:49:59,662
Don't you think
you could do that?

1052
00:49:59,663 --> 00:50:01,498
How many children do you have?

1053
00:50:01,499 --> 00:50:05,001
Twelve!

1054
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:06,002
Twelve children, wow.
You have some virile sperm. - Yes.
- I've got chunky semen.

1055
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:09,205
You know,
with a family that big,

1056
00:50:09,206 --> 00:50:11,107
you could probably
start an army.

1057
00:50:11,108 --> 00:50:13,276
You could probably
take over North Korea
or something like that.

1058
00:50:13,277 --> 00:50:14,944
You could probably take over all
the real estate in North Korea.

1059
00:50:14,945 --> 00:50:16,746
I am not interested
in North Korea.

1060
00:50:16,747 --> 00:50:19,215
I am only interested
in my properties

1061
00:50:19,216 --> 00:50:21,684
here in Bushwick, Mr. Sparrow.

1062
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:24,587
I need to collect the rent!

1063
00:50:24,588 --> 00:50:25,889
Okay, I understand,
now you understand me, okay.

1064
00:50:29,293 --> 00:50:31,027
There is no rent.

1065
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:32,762
You're not charging me
anymore rent,

1066
00:50:32,763 --> 00:50:34,664
and I'm not paying
anymore rent.

1067
00:50:34,665 --> 00:50:37,367
You understand what I'm
telling you, Mr. Leiberman?

1068
00:50:37,368 --> 00:50:40,603
I do, Mr. Sparrow.

1069
00:50:40,604 --> 00:50:41,771
Very good, very good.

1070
00:50:41,772 --> 00:50:44,407
And you're okay with what
I'm saying, Mr. Leiberman?

1071
00:50:44,408 --> 00:50:45,642
I can't believe
I'm saying this but yes,

1072
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:52,215
I am, Mr. Sparrow.

1073
00:50:52,216 --> 00:50:54,417
Terrific, that's great!
That's awesome.

1074
00:50:54,418 --> 00:50:57,086
What a great understanding.
That's terrific.

1075
00:50:57,087 --> 00:50:58,521
Okay, now that we have
all that figured out,

1076
00:50:58,522 --> 00:51:00,490
let me escort you out
of the building.

1077
00:51:00,491 --> 00:51:03,159
How do you say
"Good day" in Yiddish?

1078
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:04,327
"Good Day."

1079
00:51:04,328 --> 00:51:05,495
Well, if I could
pronounce that, I would,

1080
00:51:05,496 --> 00:51:07,697
but I can't, but have
a nice day regardless.

1081
00:51:07,698 --> 00:51:09,732
And say hello
to your twelve children

1082
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:12,235
and your wife who I'm sure
is very, very tired.

1083
00:51:12,236 --> 00:51:14,404
So have a good day.
Thank you very much!

1084
00:52:06,757 --> 00:52:07,190
You know, my ex-girlfriend Jody
and I use to argue about this.

1085
00:52:11,128 --> 00:52:13,396
I use to have this fantasy,
this exact thing,

1086
00:52:13,397 --> 00:52:16,499
where I would be in bed
with three beautiful women,

1087
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:18,768
and she thought it was
really misogynistic.

1088
00:52:18,769 --> 00:52:20,236
So we use to argue about it,

1089
00:52:20,237 --> 00:52:23,139
but this isn't misogynistic.

1090
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:25,642
Misogyny means to hate women.

1091
00:52:25,643 --> 00:52:27,710
I'm loving on three women.

1092
00:52:27,711 --> 00:52:28,911
So I never understood
that argument.

1093
00:52:32,516 --> 00:52:34,317
Anyway, let's get it on again.

1094
00:52:34,318 --> 00:52:36,653
I think that would be
a good idea.

1095
00:52:36,654 --> 00:52:37,487
Sure.

1096
00:52:37,488 --> 00:52:38,788
- Okay.
- Yeah.

1097
00:52:38,789 --> 00:52:41,658
Let's try something different.
I got a couple of ideas in mind.

1098
00:52:41,659 --> 00:52:45,561
Like what?

1099
00:52:45,562 --> 00:52:48,798
I was thinking you, Blake,
could lie on your back and Denise, you could
sit on Blake's face.

1100
00:52:48,799 --> 00:52:51,267
Samantha you could
go down on Blake

1101
00:52:51,268 --> 00:52:54,137
and I would take you
from behind.

1102
00:52:54,138 --> 00:52:57,206
That does sound
a bit misogynistic.

1103
00:52:57,207 --> 00:52:58,675
You think so?

1104
00:52:58,676 --> 00:52:58,975
Yeah, it just feels like
you're using us as sex objects.

1105
00:53:02,279 --> 00:53:06,215
No, no, no.

1106
00:53:06,216 --> 00:53:08,718
We'd all be connected,
that's the point. Right, but you're
giving everyone orders.

1107
00:53:08,719 --> 00:53:09,952
No.

1108
00:53:09,953 --> 00:53:11,788
I'm offering suggestions,
I'm not...

1109
00:53:11,789 --> 00:53:13,222
You're exploiting us.

1110
00:53:13,223 --> 00:53:15,825
I'm not exploiting you all.

1111
00:53:15,826 --> 00:53:16,192
What was your
ex-girlfriend like?

1112
00:53:19,496 --> 00:53:20,697
What's that?

1113
00:53:20,698 --> 00:53:22,832
Your ex-girlfriend.

1114
00:53:22,833 --> 00:53:24,467
Jody?

1115
00:53:24,468 --> 00:53:25,668
Yeah.

1116
00:53:25,669 --> 00:53:27,570
She was....she was great.

1117
00:53:27,571 --> 00:53:31,307
She was really smart
and independent,

1118
00:53:31,308 --> 00:53:33,476
and really creative sexually
and she was amazing actually.

1119
00:53:36,947 --> 00:53:38,915
So why'd you break-up?

1120
00:53:38,916 --> 00:53:40,883
Yeah, let's change
the subject, okay.

1121
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:43,252
No, maybe you should call her.

1122
00:53:43,253 --> 00:53:45,388
No, let's not talk
about this anymore.

1123
00:53:45,389 --> 00:53:47,323
Let's try this instead.

1124
00:53:47,324 --> 00:53:48,658
I'll lie on my back.

1125
00:53:48,659 --> 00:53:51,994
Denise you sit on my face.

1126
00:53:51,995 --> 00:53:54,997
I figure Blake, I could prop
my legs up like this

1127
00:53:54,998 --> 00:53:56,799
and you could fist me,

1128
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:59,602
and then that way
I'll be the object.

1129
00:53:59,603 --> 00:54:01,237
And then Samantha,

1130
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:03,873
you could get a copy of um...

1131
00:54:03,874 --> 00:54:05,708
I've got a copy of
Ginsberg's Howl

1132
00:54:05,709 --> 00:54:06,909
on the bookshelf.

1133
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:09,245
Maybe you could just read
that while we're doing that.

1134
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:11,781
Okay.

1135
00:54:11,782 --> 00:54:13,683
...He's a strange guy
but nice, right?

1136
00:54:13,684 --> 00:54:14,016
No, he's totally cool...

1137
00:54:15,819 --> 00:54:17,220
Erik.

1138
00:54:18,622 --> 00:54:19,689
Hey, baby.

1139
00:54:20,524 --> 00:54:21,624
Don't call me that.

1140
00:54:21,625 --> 00:54:22,792
I mean, hey, honey love.

1141
00:54:22,793 --> 00:54:25,595
What are you doing here?

1142
00:54:25,596 --> 00:54:26,829
I just came by here to
get some more of my stuff. You don't have anything here.

1143
00:54:26,830 --> 00:54:29,799
I'm pretty sure I left my
Culture Club record up there.

1144
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:33,436
How you doing?

1145
00:54:33,437 --> 00:54:35,304
Great, man.
Good to see you. - Good to see you too.
- It's been too long. You look handsome.
Did you get a facelift?

1146
00:54:35,305 --> 00:54:36,639
You look even more
handsome than before.

1147
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:38,007
You look even
fatter than before.

1148
00:54:38,008 --> 00:54:41,544
Well, the only reason I look
fatter is because your mom

1149
00:54:41,545 --> 00:54:44,447
had a liposuction and I ate
all the fat off her fat ass.

1150
00:54:44,448 --> 00:54:45,448
My mom's dead.

1151
00:54:45,449 --> 00:54:47,550
Hey listen,
that shirt looks really great.

1152
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:49,552
Did you get that at
Abercrombie and Fitch because fat people
aren't allow to wear them,

1153
00:54:49,553 --> 00:54:50,953
that's why I'm going to
burn them to the ground.

1154
00:54:50,954 --> 00:54:52,622
Okay. Erik, this is
totally inappropriate.

1155
00:54:52,623 --> 00:54:54,023
You need to leave now.

1156
00:54:54,024 --> 00:54:56,459
I think the appropriate
usage of that word is

1157
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:58,828
"unappropriate", okay.

1158
00:54:58,829 --> 00:55:00,062
- Can I just talk to her alone,
why you go molest a child?
- Actually no.

1159
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:06,002
That's so funny,
such a comedian.

1160
00:55:06,003 --> 00:55:07,603
I see what you saw in him.

1161
00:55:07,604 --> 00:55:09,972
I saw a poster of your
face and a girl's vagina.

1162
00:55:09,973 --> 00:55:12,074
- Oh, really, I saw a poster....
- No, I didn't mean that.

1163
00:55:12,075 --> 00:55:13,876
It wasn't a girl's vagina,
it was a monkey's vagina.

1164
00:55:13,877 --> 00:55:15,778
Jerry Garcia, is that your
fucking name, reincarnated?

1165
00:55:15,779 --> 00:55:18,347
Jerry Garcia was a god
and you are an oddball,

1166
00:55:18,348 --> 00:55:20,550
okay and I will use a pool stick
and jam it right up your...

1167
00:55:20,551 --> 00:55:22,084
Okay, okay,
what do you want?

1168
00:55:22,085 --> 00:55:23,886
I just want to go
to the bathroom, actually.

1169
00:55:23,887 --> 00:55:25,354
Can I pee?
I just have to pee.

1170
00:55:25,355 --> 00:55:27,023
There's a corner right there.

1171
00:55:27,024 --> 00:55:28,057
Can I use the bathroom?
I just have to pee, okay?

1172
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:32,862
Then you'll never see me again,
I promise.

1173
00:55:32,863 --> 00:55:33,696
- You promise?
- No, no.

1174
00:55:33,697 --> 00:55:35,464
Yes!

1175
00:55:35,465 --> 00:55:37,667
- You promise you'll never,
ever contact me, ever again?
- You'll never see me again.

1176
00:55:37,668 --> 00:55:39,035
Only in your dreams
and your nightmares

1177
00:55:39,036 --> 00:55:41,037
will you guys ever
see me again, okay.

1178
00:55:41,038 --> 00:55:44,440
This is so....okay fine.
Just go.

1179
00:55:44,441 --> 00:55:46,642
- Thank you.
- No. After you.

1180
00:55:50,113 --> 00:55:51,514
Don't touch me.

1181
00:55:51,515 --> 00:55:53,449
All right.
We're cool.

1182
00:55:57,487 --> 00:55:58,387
What should we do?

1183
00:55:58,388 --> 00:55:59,622
Let's just wait.

1184
00:55:59,623 --> 00:56:00,723
What if he doesn't leave?

1185
00:56:00,724 --> 00:56:01,724
He'll leave.
He's harmless.

1186
00:56:01,725 --> 00:56:03,659
Do you want me
to kick his ass?

1187
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:05,795
I am harmless.

1188
00:56:05,796 --> 00:56:09,031
I was against the war in Iraq,
Afghanistan.

1189
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:09,699
I believe in love,
just like that Beatles song.

1190
00:56:13,704 --> 00:56:14,036
You know who the Beatles
were don't you....butthole?

1191
00:56:17,641 --> 00:56:19,742
Yes, I know who the Beatles are.

1192
00:56:19,743 --> 00:56:22,812
Yeah, I bet you do.

1193
00:56:22,813 --> 00:56:24,647
I bet your musical tastes
are really great. You're probably the
fan club president

1194
00:56:24,648 --> 00:56:25,882
of the Nickleback squad.

1195
00:56:25,883 --> 00:56:27,149
You've probably got a poster

1196
00:56:27,150 --> 00:56:29,151
of Justin Bieber
on your ceiling.

1197
00:56:29,152 --> 00:56:30,987
You've probably got a
Taylor Swift tattoo

1198
00:56:30,988 --> 00:56:32,822
on your testicles, don't you?

1199
00:56:32,823 --> 00:56:35,491
Look, I'm not judging you, man.
To each his own.

1200
00:56:35,492 --> 00:56:37,026
Where's my Culture Club record?

1201
00:56:37,027 --> 00:56:39,362
Erik, you used the bathroom.
You should leave now.

1202
00:56:39,363 --> 00:56:42,531
Did you know that
she proposed to me?

1203
00:56:42,532 --> 00:56:43,566
No.

1204
00:56:43,567 --> 00:56:43,900
Yep, she asked me to marry her.
That's who I am.

1205
00:56:47,704 --> 00:56:49,672
You need to leave,
like the lady said.

1206
00:56:49,673 --> 00:56:51,707
Well, you need to stop referring
to that lady as a lady.

1207
00:56:51,708 --> 00:56:53,042
That lady has a name.

1208
00:56:53,043 --> 00:56:54,477
Erik, just go.

1209
00:56:54,478 --> 00:56:55,077
Let me ask you a question,
Jay-Jay.

1210
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:58,614
Dude, get out of my face.

1211
00:57:00,751 --> 00:57:02,051
Look at me.
Look at me for a second.

1212
00:57:02,052 --> 00:57:03,452
Jody, I'm going
to punch this guy.

1213
00:57:03,453 --> 00:57:05,488
Just look at me
in the eyes, okay.

1214
00:57:05,489 --> 00:57:05,655
You got thirty seconds to
get the fuck out of here!

1215
00:57:08,859 --> 00:57:11,427
Or what?

1216
00:57:11,428 --> 00:57:14,630
You're going to open
a can of whoop-ass?No, no.

1217
00:57:14,631 --> 00:57:17,099
I'm going to open a whole
six pack of whoop-ass.I'll drink a six pack of
whoop-ass for breakfast.

1218
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:18,601
In fact, I'll drink a keg.

1219
00:57:18,602 --> 00:57:21,904
In fact,

1220
00:57:21,905 --> 00:57:23,873
I was thinking of opening up
a brewery of whoop-ass. Erik, what's going on?
Are you okay?

1221
00:57:23,874 --> 00:57:25,875
Listen to me, Jason.

1222
00:57:25,876 --> 00:57:27,810
Look me in the eyes
and do as I command.

1223
00:57:27,811 --> 00:57:28,911
Oh!

1224
00:57:28,912 --> 00:57:29,745
Fuck!

1225
00:57:29,746 --> 00:57:31,480
Jason.

1226
00:57:31,481 --> 00:57:32,648
Oh my God.

1227
00:57:32,649 --> 00:57:33,816
What the fuck was
I suppose to do?

1228
00:57:33,817 --> 00:57:35,117
You didn't have to hit him.

1229
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:36,752
Oh God.
Come here. Let me see.

1230
00:57:36,753 --> 00:57:38,087
It hurts.

1231
00:57:38,088 --> 00:57:40,122
I think he
"septumated my devium."

1232
00:57:40,123 --> 00:57:41,924
Oh God, you're bleeding.

1233
00:57:41,925 --> 00:57:43,559
Yeah.

1234
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:47,129
Erik.
What's happened to your eyes?

1235
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:48,731
I'm blinded by your love.

1236
00:57:48,732 --> 00:57:50,499
Stop.
Why are you so ridiculous?

1237
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:52,635
- Because I love you.
- Don't say that.

1238
00:57:52,636 --> 00:57:54,170
I do.
I'm sorry.

1239
00:57:54,171 --> 00:57:55,905
I need you.

1240
00:57:55,906 --> 00:57:58,007
Okay, okay.
I'm going to go get a washcloth.

1241
00:57:58,008 --> 00:58:01,577
I'm calling the cops.

1242
00:58:01,578 --> 00:58:03,512
You don't need to call the cops.
I told you he's harmless. Harmless?
Yeah, jealous ex-boyfriend.

1243
00:58:03,513 --> 00:58:05,181
Have you seen Star Eighty?

1244
00:58:05,182 --> 00:58:06,515
Ow, Ow.

1245
00:58:07,784 --> 00:58:10,019
Get off of me.

1246
00:58:11,788 --> 00:58:13,022
- Erik!
- Fuck.

1247
00:58:13,023 --> 00:58:15,124
- Ow, ow.
- What the fuck just happened?

1248
00:58:15,125 --> 00:58:16,225
I'm sorry.

1249
00:58:16,226 --> 00:58:17,660
Did he bite you?

1250
00:58:17,661 --> 00:58:20,629
God, he fucking bit me.

1251
00:58:20,630 --> 00:58:22,198
Good-bye, Jody.

1252
00:58:22,199 --> 00:58:24,066
What? Jesus.

1253
00:58:24,067 --> 00:58:25,468
Okay, just stop it.
Stay still.

1254
00:58:25,469 --> 00:58:27,236
Oh, fuck! Fuck!

1255
00:58:27,237 --> 00:58:28,871
Just stop.

1256
00:58:28,872 --> 00:58:29,271
Oh God, fuck.

1257
00:58:33,844 --> 00:58:35,845
- Do something, make it better.
- Okay, okay. Just stay still.

1258
00:58:35,846 --> 00:58:37,480
Make it better, make it better,
make it better,

1259
00:58:37,481 --> 00:58:39,048
make it better, make it better.

1260
00:58:39,049 --> 00:58:41,117
- Fuck, Fuck, Fuck, Fuck...
- Shh.

1261
00:59:33,203 --> 00:59:34,837
Hey, Hey.

1262
00:59:34,838 --> 00:59:37,139
- What's going on?
- Oh, hey.

1263
00:59:37,140 --> 00:59:38,707
- Is that....
- How are you doing?

1264
00:59:38,708 --> 00:59:40,142
- It's you!
- Yeah!

1265
00:59:40,143 --> 00:59:42,144
- It's you!
- Hey, what are you doing?

1266
00:59:42,145 --> 00:59:44,213
Come on, get over here,
get in this.

1267
00:59:44,214 --> 00:59:46,082
What?

1268
00:59:46,083 --> 00:59:47,216
Try some of this
right here, man. Oh, I would love some, yeah.

1269
00:59:47,217 --> 00:59:48,617
Yeah, come on.
Get on in there.

1270
00:59:48,618 --> 00:59:50,286
- Oh, thank you.
- There you go.

1271
00:59:56,293 --> 00:59:57,793
It's so humid tonight.

1272
00:59:57,794 --> 00:59:59,361
Mm-hmm.

1273
01:00:03,333 --> 01:00:05,801
Global warming is
serious business.

1274
01:00:05,802 --> 01:00:06,602
People really need to take care
of the environment, I think.

1275
01:00:09,806 --> 01:00:11,107
Yeah,

1276
01:00:11,108 --> 01:00:14,043
I don't really think about the
environment so much, anymore.

1277
01:00:14,044 --> 01:00:17,046
I did a lot when I was younger,
but so much now, you know.

1278
01:00:17,047 --> 01:00:20,616
You want some more of this?

1279
01:00:20,617 --> 01:00:21,584
- Yeah, I'll take a little sip.
- Yeah, have some more.

1280
01:00:25,188 --> 01:00:27,323
It is hot though...hot as fuck!

1281
01:00:27,324 --> 01:00:28,858
Mm-hmm.

1282
01:00:28,859 --> 01:00:30,826
- Insane...
- Yeah.

1283
01:00:30,827 --> 01:00:31,727
Oh man.

1284
01:00:31,728 --> 01:00:33,062
I think I'm done with him.

1285
01:00:33,063 --> 01:00:35,197
Yeah me too, I think.
Yeah.

1286
01:00:39,703 --> 01:00:42,872
Do you want a bev nap?

1287
01:00:42,873 --> 01:00:44,173
- Oh, you've got a bev nap?
- Yeah.

1288
01:00:44,174 --> 01:00:46,375
Oh perfect.

1289
01:00:46,376 --> 01:00:47,977
I just keep them around,
in case. Oh, great.

1290
01:00:52,282 --> 01:00:54,049
Oh yeah.

1291
01:00:54,050 --> 01:00:56,018
- It's good.
- Mm-hmm.

1292
01:00:56,019 --> 01:00:57,753
- I ate earlier.
- Mm-hmm.

1293
01:00:57,754 --> 01:01:00,756
That was a nice little snack.

1294
01:01:00,757 --> 01:01:02,258
Very good.

1295
01:01:02,259 --> 01:01:02,825
Yeah, hmm.

1296
01:01:04,861 --> 01:01:06,862
Mm-hmm. Wow.

1297
01:01:08,965 --> 01:01:10,866
I got everything?

1298
01:01:12,402 --> 01:01:14,203
You got a little bit,
right there. So...

1299
01:01:21,077 --> 01:01:25,080
So, you think he's got a family?

1300
01:01:25,081 --> 01:01:27,950
I don't think about that
kind of stuff anymore, do you?

1301
01:01:27,951 --> 01:01:31,086
- I do actually....lately too,
more than ever.
- Really?

1302
01:01:31,087 --> 01:01:33,722
So you still care a little bit?

1303
01:01:33,723 --> 01:01:35,925
Sure, yeah.

1304
01:01:35,926 --> 01:01:39,195
Maybe we should go have
a little walk and talk.

1305
01:01:39,196 --> 01:01:41,197
Yeah, that would be great.

1306
01:01:45,802 --> 01:01:48,137
- Yep, John Lennon.
- Wow.

1307
01:01:48,138 --> 01:01:49,438
Ken Lay, yeah.

1308
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:50,973
Amelia Earhart.

1309
01:01:50,974 --> 01:01:52,241
- Amelia Earhart? Wow.
- Mm-hmm.

1310
01:01:52,242 --> 01:01:53,842
What about Slobodan Milosevic?

1311
01:01:53,843 --> 01:01:57,213
Yep, he's not dead.
He's one of us.

1312
01:01:57,214 --> 01:01:59,982
I knew that fucker wasn't dead!
That sucks!

1313
01:01:59,983 --> 01:02:01,750
How about Pol Pot?

1314
01:02:01,751 --> 01:02:03,953
No, I think he's dead.
He's really dead.

1315
01:02:03,954 --> 01:02:05,187
That's a relief.
That's good.

1316
01:02:05,188 --> 01:02:06,822
How's John Lennon?

1317
01:02:06,823 --> 01:02:07,990
- Awesome.
- Is he awesome?

1318
01:02:07,991 --> 01:02:09,225
He's an awesome guy.

1319
01:02:09,226 --> 01:02:12,228
But Ken Lay is obviously,
a real dick.

1320
01:02:12,229 --> 01:02:13,662
- Oh I'm sure.
- He's a piece of shit.

1321
01:02:13,663 --> 01:02:13,862
Even though he comes to this...
We all get together at this...

1322
01:02:17,767 --> 01:02:19,468
Every five years there's
this big get together,

1323
01:02:19,469 --> 01:02:20,402
- it's beautiful,
- Uh-huh.

1324
01:02:20,403 --> 01:02:22,371
a big celebration,
everybody hangs out.

1325
01:02:22,372 --> 01:02:23,472
Ken Lay's there,
he's a dick,

1326
01:02:23,473 --> 01:02:26,408
but Lennon is there
so it's cool.

1327
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:28,377
Oh, yeah that would
be cool to meet him.

1328
01:02:28,378 --> 01:02:32,147
So you've got to come.

1329
01:02:32,148 --> 01:02:33,349
It's fun, you have to
come to this next one. I don't think so.

1330
01:02:33,350 --> 01:02:36,752
I think I'm kind of done
with all of this stuff.

1331
01:02:36,753 --> 01:02:38,187
What do you mean?

1332
01:02:38,188 --> 01:02:40,122
I'm just fed-up with it, fed up
with the whole thing.

1333
01:02:40,123 --> 01:02:42,291
You don't think it's better
now than it was before?

1334
01:02:42,292 --> 01:02:42,691
Look, I was selfish before,
but now it's out of control.

1335
01:02:46,863 --> 01:02:50,432
I think I want to start thinking
about other people, you know.

1336
01:02:50,433 --> 01:02:50,766
Maybe start a family?

1337
01:02:54,237 --> 01:02:55,437
It's hard to explain.

1338
01:02:55,438 --> 01:02:56,805
Yeah, it's hard to explain.

1339
01:02:56,806 --> 01:02:58,507
You know,
you talk too much.

1340
01:02:58,508 --> 01:03:00,843
You've got to stop talking.

1341
01:03:00,844 --> 01:03:02,044
You know?

1342
01:03:02,045 --> 01:03:02,344
It's nice to be quiet sometimes.

1343
01:03:04,347 --> 01:03:05,547
Okay.

1344
01:03:13,123 --> 01:03:14,523
This is me here,
my apartment.

1345
01:03:14,524 --> 01:03:16,525
Oh, you still live
in an apartment?

1346
01:03:16,526 --> 01:03:18,427
Yeah, what?
You have a house?

1347
01:03:18,428 --> 01:03:19,895
- Do you live in a house?
- No, no.

1348
01:03:19,896 --> 01:03:20,796
Where do you live?

1349
01:03:20,797 --> 01:03:22,197
Hotels mostly.

1350
01:03:22,198 --> 01:03:24,199
- Hotels?
- Yeah.

1351
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:28,237
Do you want to come in?

1352
01:03:28,238 --> 01:03:30,205
Oh yeah, I would like to take
a shower if you don't mind. - Oh sure, not a problem.
- Oh great.

1353
01:03:30,206 --> 01:03:31,073
Hey, do you really thing
I talk too much?

1354
01:03:32,375 --> 01:03:33,342
What?

1355
01:03:33,343 --> 01:03:36,078
Do you really think
I have a big mouth?

1356
01:03:39,482 --> 01:03:42,918
Yes, you do.

1357
01:03:42,919 --> 01:03:45,487
- Hey, will you do me a favor?
- Sure.

1358
01:03:45,488 --> 01:03:47,556
- Just wash my back.
- Wash your back?

1359
01:03:47,557 --> 01:03:49,024
Just wash my back.

1360
01:03:49,025 --> 01:03:50,959
There's a...just wash my back.
Come on.

1361
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:54,129
There's a back washing
stick back there.

1362
01:03:54,130 --> 01:03:56,432
I know,
but it's my shoulder.

1363
01:03:56,433 --> 01:03:59,501
I have a bad shoulder.
I can't get my arm around.

1364
01:03:59,502 --> 01:04:01,270
Just get in,
just stand right there.

1365
01:04:01,271 --> 01:04:02,905
Okay, okay.

1366
01:04:02,906 --> 01:04:04,540
Well, what am I
suppose to do?

1367
01:04:04,541 --> 01:04:06,875
You've never washed
somebody's back?

1368
01:04:06,876 --> 01:04:08,377
Wash my back.

1369
01:04:08,378 --> 01:04:10,412
I'm not going to bite you.

1370
01:04:10,413 --> 01:04:12,381
That's funny, okay.

1371
01:04:12,382 --> 01:04:15,017
Go ahead.
There you go, yep.

1372
01:04:15,018 --> 01:04:16,852
So, you really want
to have a normal life,

1373
01:04:16,853 --> 01:04:19,888
just an average...

1374
01:04:19,889 --> 01:04:21,590
No, not an average life.

1375
01:04:21,591 --> 01:04:24,460
Wife, kids, picket fence,
two car garage, all that stuff?

1376
01:04:24,461 --> 01:04:27,896
Yeah, that sounds nice

1377
01:04:27,897 --> 01:04:29,164
but I don't want to be a
bunch of suburban zombies who watch TV all day.

1378
01:04:29,165 --> 01:04:31,166
I want to take the wife
and kids to Europe

1379
01:04:31,167 --> 01:04:33,335
and have adventures,
that kind of thing.

1380
01:04:33,336 --> 01:04:34,903
You think you're going to
be able to afford that?

1381
01:04:34,904 --> 01:04:36,138
You can afford that?

1382
01:04:36,139 --> 01:04:36,505
Not now, but I figure I can
do that eye hypnotism thing.

1383
01:04:40,243 --> 01:04:41,577
There's a lot of
potential with that.

1384
01:04:41,578 --> 01:04:43,512
You know, I'll walk
into a travel agency,

1385
01:04:43,513 --> 01:04:43,912
hypnotize a travel agent
and get free tickets.

1386
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:50,519
That would work.

1387
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:52,654
Yeah it works, I haven't paid
for a hotel in a long time.

1388
01:04:52,655 --> 01:04:54,123
I don't want to do this anymore.

1389
01:04:55,458 --> 01:04:57,459
Oh, thank you.

1390
01:04:57,460 --> 01:04:59,128
No, I mean like the lifestyle.

1391
01:04:59,129 --> 01:05:00,462
I don't want to do
the lifestyle anymore.

1392
01:05:00,463 --> 01:05:03,031
I want to be normal again.

1393
01:05:03,032 --> 01:05:04,333
God, okay.

1394
01:05:04,334 --> 01:05:06,835
- Erik, do you really want
to go back to normal?
- Yes.

1395
01:05:06,836 --> 01:05:08,370
- You really want
to change back?
- Yes, I do.

1396
01:05:08,371 --> 01:05:11,140
It's not that hard.
It's actually pretty easy.

1397
01:05:11,141 --> 01:05:12,307
There's a simple way.

1398
01:05:12,308 --> 01:05:13,575
- There's a way to go back
- Yeah.

1399
01:05:13,576 --> 01:05:15,477
to the way we were before?
Really?

1400
01:05:15,478 --> 01:05:19,415
How?

1401
01:05:19,416 --> 01:05:21,583
Listen, just get down on
your hands and knees, okay. - Okay, okay.
- No, not here.

1402
01:05:21,584 --> 01:05:21,784
No, get down on your hands
and knees and pray to God.

1403
01:05:25,288 --> 01:05:27,089
- Pray to God?
- Yes.

1404
01:05:27,090 --> 01:05:30,926
What do I pray for?

1405
01:05:30,927 --> 01:05:33,962
It's sort of like,
It's a Wonderful Life. You're praying for things
to go back to normal. Have you seen that?

1406
01:05:33,963 --> 01:05:35,230
Really?
That's all I have to do?- Yeah.
- Pray to God and ask?

1407
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:37,966
Pray as much as
you've ever prayed before.

1408
01:05:37,967 --> 01:05:40,669
Pray for forgiveness,
for absolution.

1409
01:05:40,670 --> 01:05:43,472
Ask God to take things
back to normal.

1410
01:05:47,377 --> 01:05:49,244
That's all I have to do?
I can just pray to God?

1411
01:05:49,245 --> 01:05:50,479
Yeah, totally.

1412
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:52,414
Oh, Jesus Christ,
that's so incredible.

1413
01:05:52,415 --> 01:05:54,416
No, come on.

1414
01:05:54,417 --> 01:05:56,385
There's no God.

1415
01:05:56,386 --> 01:05:57,920
I was just kidding.

1416
01:05:57,921 --> 01:06:00,022
You can't go back.

1417
01:06:00,023 --> 01:06:02,458
I would love to see
that image...

1418
01:06:02,459 --> 01:06:04,726
You on your hands and
knees praying to God,

1419
01:06:04,727 --> 01:06:06,528
right after you sucked someone's
blood out of their body.

1420
01:06:09,933 --> 01:06:11,200
That's hilarious.

1421
01:06:11,201 --> 01:06:12,134
You're an asshole.

1422
01:06:12,135 --> 01:06:13,602
I'd love to see that.

1423
01:06:13,603 --> 01:06:15,237
I'm getting out.

1424
01:06:15,238 --> 01:06:16,538
God, it was great to see you.

1425
01:06:17,707 --> 01:06:19,107
- It was really great
running into you.
- Yeah.

1426
01:06:19,108 --> 01:06:22,444
It's crazy how you run into
people in New York all the time.

1427
01:06:22,445 --> 01:06:24,112
In a city this big?
Nuts, right.

1428
01:06:24,113 --> 01:06:26,648
Yeah.

1429
01:06:26,649 --> 01:06:28,517
Thanks for the shower.
It was great. - My pleasure.
- And the shirt.

1430
01:06:28,518 --> 01:06:30,385
- Anytime.
- Awesome.

1431
01:06:30,386 --> 01:06:32,254
- Just keep it.
- Thank you, thanks.

1432
01:06:32,255 --> 01:06:33,522
- See you around.
- See you around.

1433
01:06:33,523 --> 01:06:35,557
- Oh, hey. I wanted to ask
you one thing though.
- Okay.

1434
01:06:35,558 --> 01:06:38,627
Up in the shower,
you were talking about God,

1435
01:06:38,628 --> 01:06:41,363
- and you said there is no God.
- Yeah.

1436
01:06:41,364 --> 01:06:43,265
So, there is no God?

1437
01:06:43,266 --> 01:06:45,033
Who knows?

1438
01:06:45,034 --> 01:06:47,202
Good. Okay. Yeah.

1439
01:06:47,203 --> 01:06:48,337
Okay. Bye Erik.
See you later.

1440
01:06:48,338 --> 01:06:50,038
See you.

1441
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:05,747
Hi.

1442
01:08:11,054 --> 01:08:12,487
Hi.

1443
01:08:20,163 --> 01:08:21,263
Do you want something to drink?

1444
01:08:21,264 --> 01:08:22,698
Yeah, sure.

1445
01:08:22,699 --> 01:08:26,201
Um,
I don't really have anything.

1446
01:08:26,202 --> 01:08:27,502
You want some water?

1447
01:08:27,503 --> 01:08:29,705
- Oh no, it's fine.
- Okay.

1448
01:08:29,706 --> 01:08:31,273
I'm really surprised
to see you, actually.

1449
01:08:33,643 --> 01:08:33,875
Yeah, I'm surprised too.

1450
01:08:37,213 --> 01:08:38,747
I missed you.

1451
01:08:38,748 --> 01:08:42,484
Yeah, I missed you too.

1452
01:08:42,485 --> 01:08:44,519
What happened to
"what's his face?"

1453
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:46,788
Oh, Jason?
It didn't work out.

1454
01:08:46,789 --> 01:08:49,257
Really?
Why not?

1455
01:08:49,258 --> 01:08:51,760
He started sleeping
around a lot.

1456
01:08:51,761 --> 01:08:53,662
Like, a lot.

1457
01:08:53,663 --> 01:08:57,299
Like, with women
and men, maybe a sheep.

1458
01:08:57,300 --> 01:08:59,768
- Did he bite you?
- What?

1459
01:08:59,769 --> 01:09:01,503
He didn't bite you.

1460
01:09:01,504 --> 01:09:03,538
No.

1461
01:09:03,539 --> 01:09:04,406
Erik, I'm worried about you.

1462
01:09:05,842 --> 01:09:07,743
Are you okay?

1463
01:09:09,679 --> 01:09:11,847
Listen, I don't really
want to talk, okay.

1464
01:09:14,384 --> 01:09:15,317
Okay.

1465
01:09:15,318 --> 01:09:17,686
Will you...will you
just sit with me?

1466
01:09:17,687 --> 01:09:19,488
Yeah.

1467
01:09:19,489 --> 01:09:20,322
Can we just sit here
and not talk?

1468
01:09:23,226 --> 01:09:25,527
Yeah, okay.

1469
01:09:25,528 --> 01:09:27,663
Thank you.

1470
01:09:52,388 --> 01:09:54,222
- Great view, isn't it?
- Yeah.

1471
01:09:54,223 --> 01:09:56,224
- It reminds me of you.
- Why?

1472
01:09:56,225 --> 01:09:57,492
It's pretty.

1473
01:09:57,493 --> 01:09:59,461
That's so cheesy.

1474
01:09:59,462 --> 01:10:01,663
- You want some wine?
- Yeah, I do.

1475
01:10:01,664 --> 01:10:02,964
The wedding was beautiful,
wasn't it?

1476
01:10:04,767 --> 01:10:06,601
Yeah, it was.

1477
01:10:06,602 --> 01:10:08,937
Your mother was
surprisingly warm to me.

1478
01:10:08,938 --> 01:10:10,505
She's very happy now.

1479
01:10:10,506 --> 01:10:12,908
Yeah, I think I like
your mom now.

1480
01:10:12,909 --> 01:10:14,576
She likes you too.

1481
01:10:14,577 --> 01:10:16,344
Yeah, but your Grandfather
was kind of cold,

1482
01:10:16,345 --> 01:10:17,512
actually, a little.

1483
01:10:17,513 --> 01:10:19,715
Oh, he hates you.

1484
01:10:19,716 --> 01:10:20,782
He does?

1485
01:10:20,783 --> 01:10:22,851
Well yeah,
because you're Turkish.

1486
01:10:22,852 --> 01:10:24,419
- Seriously?
- Uh-huh.

1487
01:10:24,420 --> 01:10:25,787
No.

1488
01:10:25,788 --> 01:10:27,222
No, no.
Don't take it personally.

1489
01:10:27,223 --> 01:10:29,524
He hates everybody,
like, Turkish people,

1490
01:10:29,525 --> 01:10:32,427
Africans, French,
Mexicans, Canadians,

1491
01:10:32,428 --> 01:10:33,662
Irish, Germans.

1492
01:10:33,663 --> 01:10:35,530
- That's the whole population.
- Yeah.

1493
01:10:35,531 --> 01:10:37,265
What is he?
What is his nationality?

1494
01:10:37,266 --> 01:10:38,800
- He's a real jerk.
- He's a real jerk.

1495
01:10:38,801 --> 01:10:40,969
You know there was
a girl at work

1496
01:10:40,970 --> 01:10:42,637
- who wouldn't go out with me
because I was...
- What?

1497
01:10:42,638 --> 01:10:44,940
Never mind.
Nothing, nothing.

1498
01:10:44,941 --> 01:10:47,242
Take your pants off.

1499
01:10:47,243 --> 01:10:48,977
Okay, yeah, sure thing.

1500
01:10:48,978 --> 01:10:50,512
You don't want to do
that romantic thing

1501
01:10:50,513 --> 01:10:53,348
where I undress you
and you undress me?

1502
01:10:53,349 --> 01:10:55,817
No, I don't want to.
I just want to have sex.

1503
01:10:55,818 --> 01:10:57,953
Okay, I hear you.

1504
01:10:57,954 --> 01:10:59,688
- Hurry up.
- Yeah.

1505
01:11:09,632 --> 01:11:09,798
- Oh fuck.
- Oh God, not now.

1506
01:11:13,636 --> 01:11:15,470
- No, I'm okay, I'm okay.
- Are you sure?

1507
01:11:15,471 --> 01:11:16,772
Yes, I'm okay.

1508
01:11:16,773 --> 01:11:17,973
Oh fuck. Oh my God.
I've got to go.

1509
01:11:21,010 --> 01:11:22,377
No!

1510
01:11:22,378 --> 01:11:23,545
I have to go.

1511
01:11:23,546 --> 01:11:25,847
Erik, just bite me.

1512
01:11:25,848 --> 01:11:27,382
What?

1513
01:11:27,383 --> 01:11:29,718
- Just do it.
- No, no.

1514
01:11:29,719 --> 01:11:30,952
I want you to.
Just bite me.

1515
01:11:30,953 --> 01:11:34,956
I can't.

1516
01:11:34,957 --> 01:11:38,326
No, I've thought about this.
I want you to do it. Look, I'm just going to go
out and get a puppy to bite

1517
01:11:38,327 --> 01:11:39,594
or something like that.

1518
01:11:39,595 --> 01:11:40,762
I can't bite you.

1519
01:11:40,763 --> 01:11:40,962
No, I want you to.
Just bite me, its fine.

1520
01:11:44,767 --> 01:11:46,601
I don't want you to
be like me, okay.

1521
01:11:46,602 --> 01:11:48,937
This is not a superhero.
This isn't a superpower.

1522
01:11:48,938 --> 01:11:50,672
This is a curse.

1523
01:11:50,673 --> 01:11:52,340
Oh, fuck me.

1524
01:11:52,341 --> 01:11:54,943
I know why
you won't bite me.

1525
01:11:54,944 --> 01:11:57,512
I told you, I don't want you
to be like me, okay.

1526
01:11:57,513 --> 01:11:58,847
No, no, it's not that.

1527
01:11:58,848 --> 01:12:01,616
It's your commitment issues,
okay.

1528
01:12:01,617 --> 01:12:02,584
What?

1529
01:12:02,585 --> 01:12:04,486
I committed to you.
I got married, okay.

1530
01:12:04,487 --> 01:12:05,487
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1531
01:12:05,488 --> 01:12:08,690
Yes, but if you bite me,

1532
01:12:08,691 --> 01:12:10,892
that means you'll have to
live with me forever. What?
What are you talking about?

1533
01:12:10,893 --> 01:12:11,126
You get to go on and then I die
and you get to be single again.

1534
01:12:14,463 --> 01:12:17,365
If you bite me,

1535
01:12:17,366 --> 01:12:17,933
it means you're really
committed to me. Oh, God damn.
Oh, motherfucker.

1536
01:12:21,671 --> 01:12:23,471
Listen,
I want to be with you, okay,

1537
01:12:23,472 --> 01:12:26,908
but asking me to commit
to you for eternity....that's,

1538
01:12:26,909 --> 01:12:28,677
that's asking for a lot.

1539
01:12:28,678 --> 01:12:30,979
Erik, no.
True love is eternal. So...

1540
01:12:30,980 --> 01:12:32,347
Ha, ha, ha.

1541
01:12:32,348 --> 01:12:33,181
Are you laughing at me?

1542
01:12:33,182 --> 01:12:34,816
No, I'm just in
such fucking pain.

1543
01:12:34,817 --> 01:12:36,418
I'm doing that thing
where people laugh

1544
01:12:36,419 --> 01:12:37,552
when they're in pain.

1545
01:12:37,553 --> 01:12:39,454
This shit isn't funny though.

1546
01:12:39,455 --> 01:12:41,523
Oh God, listen.

1547
01:12:41,524 --> 01:12:44,392
Can't we just be married
for forty or fifty years

1548
01:12:44,393 --> 01:12:45,560
and squeeze out
a bunch of babies

1549
01:12:45,561 --> 01:12:46,928
and have a normal life?

1550
01:12:46,929 --> 01:12:48,797
Can't we just do that?
I've got to go.

1551
01:12:48,798 --> 01:12:51,099
No, I'm not pregnant.

1552
01:12:51,100 --> 01:12:53,668
Yeah, but there's nothing
wrong with my sperm sample.

1553
01:12:53,669 --> 01:12:54,870
We went to the doctor,

1554
01:12:54,871 --> 01:12:56,571
they said that my
chunky semen was fine.

1555
01:12:56,572 --> 01:12:57,739
Everything's going to be okay.

1556
01:12:57,740 --> 01:12:59,808
You know, I don't even
know if I want your children.

1557
01:12:59,809 --> 01:13:02,677
What if they're
little monsters

1558
01:13:02,678 --> 01:13:04,779
and they end up
biting my tit offwhen I'm trying
to breast feed them.

1559
01:13:04,780 --> 01:13:07,616
That's the sprit, okay.

1560
01:13:07,617 --> 01:13:09,885
I like it when
you're being funny, even though we're
having an argument.

1561
01:13:09,886 --> 01:13:10,952
- That's terrific.
- I don't want to argue. I don't want to argue
either, okay?

1562
01:13:10,953 --> 01:13:12,487
But I've got to go.

1563
01:13:12,488 --> 01:13:14,489
Come on,

1564
01:13:14,490 --> 01:13:16,391
don't you want a little nibble?

1565
01:13:16,392 --> 01:13:17,125
Doesn't that look nice?

1566
01:13:17,126 --> 01:13:18,727
Nono, no, no.
I can't.

1567
01:13:18,728 --> 01:13:20,028
Look,
I'll happily drink your blood

1568
01:13:20,029 --> 01:13:21,930
during that time
of the month, okay.

1569
01:13:21,931 --> 01:13:23,932
Ew, Erik that's so gross.

1570
01:13:23,933 --> 01:13:25,867
I know it is, I'm sorry.
I've got to go.

1571
01:13:25,868 --> 01:13:26,835
You know,
you haven't changed at all.

1572
01:13:26,836 --> 01:13:28,169
You're still the same person.

1573
01:13:28,170 --> 01:13:30,438
I haven't changed?
Of course I've changed.

1574
01:13:30,439 --> 01:13:33,008
I've embraced all the fears
that I've ever had in my life,

1575
01:13:33,009 --> 01:13:35,877
marriage and babies,
I've embraced all of it.

1576
01:13:35,878 --> 01:13:37,512
I'm the same person.

1577
01:13:37,513 --> 01:13:40,482
I'm a changed person,
I'm a changed person, okay.

1578
01:13:40,483 --> 01:13:44,052
I just feel like I'm going to
fuckin'...my stomach feels like

1579
01:13:44,053 --> 01:13:47,055
somebody is eating me
from the inside, goddamn.

1580
01:13:49,492 --> 01:13:50,592
Listen, I love you, okay.

1581
01:13:52,828 --> 01:13:54,930
You're my little baby doll,
okay.

1582
01:13:54,931 --> 01:13:57,065
We got married,
I will give you my everything,

1583
01:13:57,066 --> 01:13:58,867
my cock,
I will give you my testicles,

1584
01:13:58,868 --> 01:14:00,068
they all belong to you.

1585
01:14:00,069 --> 01:14:02,003
My hands, my palms,
my fingerprints,

1586
01:14:02,004 --> 01:14:03,705
my feet, they're all yours.

1587
01:14:03,706 --> 01:14:05,040
You can keep your feet.

1588
01:14:05,041 --> 01:14:08,043
Yeah, my little sphincter
belongs to you.

1589
01:14:08,044 --> 01:14:10,612
No, I don't--
You can keep that.

1590
01:14:10,613 --> 01:14:12,314
- My heart belongs to you.
- That's nice.

1591
01:14:13,182 --> 01:14:15,850
Okay, okay, okay, go, go.

1592
01:14:17,753 --> 01:14:19,087
Please, okay.

1593
01:14:19,088 --> 01:14:21,089
I love you.

1594
01:14:21,090 --> 01:14:23,558
Can I get you
anything while I'm out? No, just don't forget
to bring your phone.

1595
01:14:23,559 --> 01:14:24,559
Huh, what?

1596
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:26,194
Your phone, don't forget
to bring your phone.

1597
01:14:26,195 --> 01:14:28,063
That's right.
See, I'm a changed person.

1598
01:14:28,064 --> 01:14:28,897
Be careful.

1599
01:14:28,898 --> 01:14:31,666
I got a Motorola Tracfone
for you.

1600
01:14:31,667 --> 01:14:33,068
I got it here.

1601
01:14:33,069 --> 01:14:35,136
I'll text you pictures,
my honey.

1602
01:14:35,137 --> 01:14:36,738
- I love you.
- I love you.

1603
01:14:36,739 --> 01:14:39,474
I love you, bye...

1604
01:14:51,854 --> 01:14:54,956
Who's your friend?

1605
01:14:54,957 --> 01:14:57,158
Why don't you introduce us?

1606
01:14:57,159 --> 01:15:00,128
Hey, Penelope,
it's you, oh my God.

1607
01:15:00,129 --> 01:15:02,197
Hi.
How are you?

1608
01:15:02,198 --> 01:15:04,065
I've been running into
everyone in New York lately.

1609
01:15:04,066 --> 01:15:05,600
Yeah, me too.

1610
01:15:05,601 --> 01:15:07,002
Wow.

1611
01:15:07,003 --> 01:15:09,170
You clean up nicely.

1612
01:15:09,171 --> 01:15:10,071
Thank you.

1613
01:15:10,072 --> 01:15:10,905
You look very
handsome in a tuxedo.

1614
01:15:14,243 --> 01:15:15,710
You look good.

1615
01:15:15,711 --> 01:15:16,511
Thank you.

1616
01:15:16,512 --> 01:15:18,246
Really good.

1617
01:15:18,247 --> 01:15:18,847
Well, what's the occasion?

1618
01:15:21,617 --> 01:15:23,251
Oh, it's just a wedding.

1619
01:15:23,252 --> 01:15:24,185
Oh, who's getting married?

1620
01:15:25,688 --> 01:15:27,522
Just a friend.

1621
01:15:37,233 --> 01:15:38,566
I'm back.

1622
01:15:38,567 --> 01:15:40,201
Did you eat?

1623
01:15:40,202 --> 01:15:42,103
Yeah.

1624
01:15:42,104 --> 01:15:44,639
What did you have?

1625
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:48,176
Um, you don't want to know.
You don't want to know that.

1626
01:15:48,177 --> 01:15:50,145
Yeah I do.
Did you eat a rat?

1627
01:15:50,146 --> 01:15:53,014
Yeah, right. That's exactly
what I had, a rat.

1628
01:15:53,015 --> 01:15:54,582
Aren't you glad
I didn't bite you now?

1629
01:15:54,583 --> 01:15:56,618
This is what you would
have to look forward to.

1630
01:15:56,619 --> 01:15:58,219
Yeah, I mean,
on second thought.

1631
01:15:58,220 --> 01:16:00,588
Yeah, I going to
go to the bathroom.

1632
01:16:00,589 --> 01:16:02,090
Okay!

1633
01:16:09,198 --> 01:16:11,766
Erik, did you order
room service?

1634
01:16:11,767 --> 01:16:13,168
Huh.

1635
01:16:13,169 --> 01:16:15,203
There's someone at the door.

1636
01:16:15,204 --> 01:16:17,172
Yeah, get it.

1637
01:16:32,788 --> 01:16:33,922
Can I help you?

1638
01:16:33,923 --> 01:16:37,092
Yes.
Can I come in?

1639
01:16:37,093 --> 01:16:38,159
Um, I think you
have the wrong...

1640
01:16:41,363 --> 01:16:42,964
Erik!

1641
01:16:42,965 --> 01:16:44,332
Yeah.

1642
01:16:44,333 --> 01:16:44,499
I followed you.

1643
01:16:47,002 --> 01:16:48,203
Oh, do you two know
one another?

1644
01:16:50,005 --> 01:16:50,839
Yes, he just bit me!

1645
01:16:54,243 --> 01:16:56,778
I need to go wipe!

1646
01:16:56,779 --> 01:16:59,614
I'm so sorry to bother you but,
I just feel kind of confused.

1647
01:17:03,152 --> 01:17:05,920
Like, my legs feel weird.

1648
01:17:05,921 --> 01:17:06,588
It kind of feels like shrooming,
but way better.

1649
01:17:10,059 --> 01:17:11,726
Erik, get out here now.

1650
01:17:11,727 --> 01:17:14,162
Wow, you are bossy.

1651
01:17:14,163 --> 01:17:17,031
Do you always talk
to him like this?

1652
01:17:17,032 --> 01:17:19,667
I'm here.
I'm here.

1653
01:17:19,668 --> 01:17:21,002
Erik, did you bite her?

1654
01:17:21,003 --> 01:17:22,637
I've never seen
this woman in my life.

1655
01:17:22,638 --> 01:17:25,039
Oh my God,
that is such bologna.

1656
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:27,108
We work together

1657
01:17:27,109 --> 01:17:28,543
and he used to masturbate to
pictures of me in the bathroom.

1658
01:17:32,214 --> 01:17:34,015
- That's not true.
- Yes it is.

1659
01:17:34,016 --> 01:17:34,182
Jamie installed a spy camera
in the ceiling of the bathroom,

1660
01:17:37,753 --> 01:17:39,687
and he made a video of you.

1661
01:17:39,688 --> 01:17:41,656
He has like, ten videos.

1662
01:17:41,657 --> 01:17:43,224
What?
He did what?

1663
01:17:43,225 --> 01:17:44,993
Your husband's a pervert.

1664
01:17:44,994 --> 01:17:46,728
I'm not the pervert.
Jamie's the pervert.

1665
01:17:46,729 --> 01:17:48,129
Did he really do that?
And you all watched me?

1666
01:17:48,130 --> 01:17:50,398
- He installed a video camera?
- I didn't. Everybody else did.

1667
01:17:50,399 --> 01:17:51,966
Everybody at work
saw me jerking off?

1668
01:17:51,967 --> 01:17:54,135
I didn't.
I don't like porn.

1669
01:17:54,136 --> 01:17:55,303
I watch the History channel.

1670
01:17:55,304 --> 01:17:58,306
- Erik, did you bite her?
- No, I did not bite her.

1671
01:17:58,307 --> 01:18:00,875
- Yes.
- No, I didn't.

1672
01:18:00,876 --> 01:18:03,044
Yes.

1673
01:18:03,045 --> 01:18:04,712
Maybe a little bit.

1674
01:18:04,713 --> 01:18:04,879
See, and I really wish
you would do it again,

1675
01:18:08,350 --> 01:18:11,352
because it felt good.

1676
01:18:11,353 --> 01:18:13,054
She's a crazy woman.
She's out of her mind.

1677
01:18:13,055 --> 01:18:13,955
She's a lunatic.

1678
01:18:13,956 --> 01:18:14,989
Look at her.
Look at her.

1679
01:18:14,990 --> 01:18:18,092
She's a...she's a...

1680
01:18:18,093 --> 01:18:19,727
- What are you doing?
- I'm leaving.

1681
01:18:19,728 --> 01:18:21,229
You can't go,
not on our wedding night,

1682
01:18:21,230 --> 01:18:23,231
- Listen--
- I'm such an idiot.

1683
01:18:23,232 --> 01:18:24,832
I'm the idiot, okay.
Listen--

1684
01:18:24,833 --> 01:18:28,303
I am not an idiot.
I have an IQ of 150.

1685
01:18:28,304 --> 01:18:29,437
Will you please...

1686
01:18:29,438 --> 01:18:31,072
- Bullshit, no you don't.
- I do.

1687
01:18:31,073 --> 01:18:32,974
I was a child prodigy,

1688
01:18:32,975 --> 01:18:35,043
and I got a perfect score
on my SAT's.

1689
01:18:35,044 --> 01:18:37,412
Don't do this, listen.

1690
01:18:37,413 --> 01:18:39,747
Erik, I don't care
what you have to say. "Jody, I'm sorry.
Jody, I love you.

1691
01:18:39,748 --> 01:18:40,949
Jody, I made a mistake."
It's not cute any more.

1692
01:18:42,151 --> 01:18:44,352
Ooh, I want some.

1693
01:19:05,307 --> 01:19:07,342
Hey, that's enough.

1694
01:19:07,343 --> 01:19:08,276
Hey, come on,
you're going to hurt her.

1695
01:19:09,378 --> 01:19:11,045
You're going to kill her.
Stop it.

1696
01:19:11,046 --> 01:19:11,813
Okay.

1697
01:19:12,982 --> 01:19:15,250
Be gentle with her.

1698
01:19:17,286 --> 01:19:19,187
She's my wife.

1699
01:19:21,123 --> 01:19:23,825
Some husband you are,

1700
01:19:23,826 --> 01:19:27,161
going around biting other woman
on your wedding night.

1701
01:19:27,162 --> 01:19:28,997
You're right.

1702
01:19:28,998 --> 01:19:30,465
Jesus, I really
screwed everything up.

1703
01:19:34,870 --> 01:19:37,105
Do you believe in Jesus?

1704
01:19:37,106 --> 01:19:39,240
No, why would you ask me that?

1705
01:19:39,241 --> 01:19:40,275
Well, you just said

1706
01:19:40,276 --> 01:19:42,377
"Jesus Christ I really
screwed everything up."

1707
01:19:42,378 --> 01:19:44,145
It's just an expression,
it's like,

1708
01:19:44,146 --> 01:19:46,147
"Jiminy Crickets,
I screwed everything up,

1709
01:19:46,148 --> 01:19:50,051
gosh darn it."

1710
01:19:50,052 --> 01:19:51,419
Yeah, but Jiminy Cricket
wasn't a prophet. He was kind of a prophet,

1711
01:19:51,420 --> 01:19:53,154
I mean, like,
to Pinocchio, sort of.

1712
01:19:53,155 --> 01:19:54,822
He was Pinocchio's conscience.

1713
01:19:54,823 --> 01:19:57,425
Yeah, but he said wise
things to Pinocchio,

1714
01:19:57,426 --> 01:19:59,227
like a prophet does.

1715
01:19:59,228 --> 01:19:59,694
But he wasn't a prophet.
He was a cricket.

1716
01:20:03,232 --> 01:20:05,500
God, Penelope, who cares?

1717
01:20:05,501 --> 01:20:08,002
See, there you go again
with the God thing.

1718
01:20:08,003 --> 01:20:09,170
So what.

1719
01:20:09,171 --> 01:20:09,537
I really think
you believe in God.

1720
01:20:13,008 --> 01:20:15,076
Do you believe in God?

1721
01:20:15,077 --> 01:20:16,177
Sure.

1722
01:20:16,178 --> 01:20:18,112
But you have an IQ of 150.

1723
01:20:18,113 --> 01:20:20,882
Yeah, well, science hasn't
scientifically proven

1724
01:20:20,883 --> 01:20:23,151
that God doesn't exist,
not definitively.

1725
01:20:24,453 --> 01:20:27,121
- Do you believe in prayer?
- What do you mean?

1726
01:20:29,858 --> 01:20:30,124
Do you believe that God
answers prayers?

1727
01:20:34,096 --> 01:20:37,365
I think it depends on
what the person prays for.

1728
01:20:43,605 --> 01:20:45,773
Would you pray with me now?

1729
01:20:46,542 --> 01:20:48,976
Okay.

1730
01:20:49,912 --> 01:20:50,311
Okay.

1731
01:21:03,125 --> 01:21:07,328
Dear Mr. God,
Mrs. God, whatever.

1732
01:21:07,329 --> 01:21:07,729
I don't normally pray but
because of all the crazy shit,

1733
01:21:11,533 --> 01:21:13,067
stuff that's been
happening recently,

1734
01:21:13,068 --> 01:21:15,002
I figured your existence

1735
01:21:15,003 --> 01:21:17,438
might not be so far-fetched,
after all.

1736
01:21:17,439 --> 01:21:18,940
It's funny that
I've never prayed,

1737
01:21:18,941 --> 01:21:20,408
because I'm a very
selfish person

1738
01:21:20,409 --> 01:21:23,478
and I consider daily prayer
a pretty selfish act.

1739
01:21:23,479 --> 01:21:25,880
I mean, "ask and
you shall receive?"

1740
01:21:25,881 --> 01:21:27,448
That sounds pretty selfish.

1741
01:21:27,449 --> 01:21:29,250
It's kind of like sitting on
Santa Claus' lap

1742
01:21:29,251 --> 01:21:31,185
every night before
you go to bed and saying

1743
01:21:31,186 --> 01:21:33,354
"Hey Santa, I want this
and Santa I want that."

1744
01:21:33,355 --> 01:21:36,257
And well, I thought
I'd take you up on that.

1745
01:21:36,258 --> 01:21:39,026
I mean, you can pray
for others too.

1746
01:21:39,027 --> 01:21:40,928
I pray for the sick
and the unfortunate.

1747
01:21:40,929 --> 01:21:43,297
I pray for other
people's happiness.

1748
01:21:43,298 --> 01:21:45,933
I pray for world peace.

1749
01:21:45,934 --> 01:21:47,335
There's no such thing.

1750
01:21:47,336 --> 01:21:49,203
World peace is impossible,
okay.

1751
01:21:49,204 --> 01:21:51,105
Well, it's like the general idea

1752
01:21:51,106 --> 01:21:52,907
that you don't just
pray for yourself.

1753
01:21:52,908 --> 01:21:54,041
You pray for others.

1754
01:21:54,042 --> 01:21:55,643
Okay, this isn't
that kind of prayer.

1755
01:21:55,644 --> 01:21:57,512
This is a selfish prayer, okay.

1756
01:21:57,513 --> 01:21:58,613
Let me have my selfish prayer.

1757
01:21:58,614 --> 01:22:01,082
Okay, okay, be selfish.

1758
01:22:01,083 --> 01:22:03,351
God, please make me
normal again.

1759
01:22:03,352 --> 01:22:05,686
Please make Penelope normal
again if that's possible.

1760
01:22:05,687 --> 01:22:07,321
At least take away her desire
to drink blood and fuck shit up.

1761
01:22:11,026 --> 01:22:14,061
Please forgive us
for biting Jody.

1762
01:22:14,062 --> 01:22:15,963
That was a mistake
and I love her so much.

1763
01:22:19,501 --> 01:22:21,969
If it's possible too, God,

1764
01:22:21,970 --> 01:22:22,703
could you forgive me for all
horrible things that I've done?

1765
01:22:26,241 --> 01:22:29,143
I've done terrible things.

1766
01:22:29,144 --> 01:22:32,046
Someone once told me that
all you have to do is

1767
01:22:32,047 --> 01:22:34,148
ask for forgiveness
and you'll forgive them,

1768
01:22:34,149 --> 01:22:35,917
<i>o matter what.</i>

1769
01:22:35,918 --> 01:22:39,587
I find it very comforting
that you're such a pushover.

1770
01:22:39,588 --> 01:22:39,954
Anyway, if you could just
take away our affliction,

1771
01:22:43,258 --> 01:22:46,227
our disease,

1772
01:22:46,228 --> 01:22:47,962
I promise to believe in you
for perpetuity,or for the end of time,
or you know, whatever.

1773
01:22:50,299 --> 01:22:51,732
Penelope, do you
want to add anything?

1774
01:22:54,136 --> 01:22:56,170
Don't forget world peace.

1775
01:22:56,171 --> 01:22:58,606
Oh yeah, God, please do
what you can for world peace

1776
01:22:58,607 --> 01:23:02,477
and maybe grant everybody
happiness if you can,

1777
01:23:02,478 --> 01:23:05,246
except for all those
corporate shithead,

1778
01:23:05,247 --> 01:23:06,547
super rich motherfuckers

1779
01:23:06,548 --> 01:23:08,249
who are are making
the world a worse place

1780
01:23:08,250 --> 01:23:11,452
than it probably
would be otherwise.

1781
01:23:11,453 --> 01:23:14,522
Anyway, yeah, that's about all.

1782
01:23:14,523 --> 01:23:17,625
Dominus forbiscum,
et tu spirit tu tu oh.

1783
01:23:17,626 --> 01:23:18,659
Allah Hallah.

1784
01:23:18,660 --> 01:23:20,628
Jesus Christ.
In the name of the holy father,

1785
01:23:20,629 --> 01:23:23,598
and the holy ghost and
the holy manger, Amen.

1786
01:23:23,599 --> 01:23:25,600
Amen.

1787
01:23:31,173 --> 01:23:32,507
She's awake.

1788
01:23:32,508 --> 01:23:35,710
Oh praise....something.

1789
01:23:35,711 --> 01:23:37,278
Are you okay,
my sweet angel?

1790
01:23:37,279 --> 01:23:39,347
Say something,
my sweet angel.

1791
01:23:47,489 --> 01:23:50,057
Are we going to fuck or what?
