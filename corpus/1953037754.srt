        No. I don't want        
        to do that, okay.

         Okay. Great.

     Listen, just give me       
     your name and your

00:06:40,499 --> 00:06:43,701
     Horses, dogs, whatever.    

121
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,273
        Did you say your        
     prayers, sweetheart?       

122
00:06:49,374 --> 00:06:50,274
             No!                

123
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:51,943
            Not you.            

124
00:06:52,044 --> 00:06:53,377
             Yes.               

125
00:06:58,050 --> 00:06:58,950
             Mom?               

126
00:06:59,051 --> 00:07:01,285
             Mm-hm?             

127
00:07:01,386 --> 00:07:03,721
     What does "youth and       
         um, Asia" mean?        

128
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:14,499
     Euthanasia is when they    
     put an animal to sleep.    

129
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,835
     You mean, kill her?        

130
00:07:16,935 --> 00:07:19,336
     Well, sometimes...It's     

131
00:07:19,437 --> 00:07:21,706
     Better to do that than     
        to let it suffer.       

132
00:07:21,807 --> 00:07:23,274
     But you can't do that!     

133
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:25,677
     Well...Your dad's not      
     gonna let that happen.     

134
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:26,845
            (to Ben)            
     are you, sweetheart?       

135
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:32,083
         Nothing's gonna        
         happen to her.         

136
00:07:32,184 --> 00:07:33,417
        Now go to sleep.        

137
00:07:33,518 --> 00:07:37,922
         Dad...I really         
        want to keep her.       

138
00:07:38,023 --> 00:07:42,060
     We can't keep her. No      
     pets allowed here.         

139
00:07:44,463 --> 00:07:46,130
             Mom?               

140
00:07:53,005 --> 00:07:55,572
     We'll go to the vet        
     tomorrow and make sure     

141
00:07:55,674 --> 00:07:57,608
     She's all right, okay?     

142
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:59,043
             Okay.              

143
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,080
         He should put          
        us all to sleep.        

144
00:08:25,304 --> 00:08:27,204
        And the good news       
         is, none of her        

145
00:08:27,306 --> 00:08:28,305
 Injuries were life threatening.

146
00:08:28,406 --> 00:08:30,942
     Well, that's a relief,     
     isn't it, charley?         

147
00:08:31,043 --> 00:08:31,943
             Yeah.              

148
00:08:32,044 --> 00:08:32,944
         Thank you, doc.        

149
00:08:33,045 --> 00:08:33,945
         You're welcome.        

150
00:08:34,046 --> 00:08:36,047
        So, when will she       
     be able to be let go?      

151
00:08:37,382 --> 00:08:38,382
             Never.             

152
00:08:39,384 --> 00:08:41,252
             Never?             

153
00:08:41,353 --> 00:08:45,289
     Yeah, you know...I         
    noticed that her foreleg    

154
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:47,291
        Was bothering her       
     when I-when I examined     

155
00:08:47,392 --> 00:08:49,560
     Her and it is, but         
     it has nothing to do       
     with the accident.         

156
00:08:49,661 --> 00:08:51,562
         What is it?            

157
00:08:51,663 --> 00:08:54,933
             Cancer.            

158
00:08:59,304 --> 00:09:00,437
     Can't you stop it?         

159
00:09:00,539 --> 00:09:04,475
     Yeah, charley, I can.      
 Unfortunately, there's only    

160
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:05,943
     Really one way that        
         I can do that.         

161
00:09:06,044 --> 00:09:08,045
 You mean, amputate her leg?    

162
00:09:08,147 --> 00:09:15,219
        Yeah. Do you want       
     to go to that expense?     

163
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:18,022
     How far advanced is it?    

164
00:09:18,123 --> 00:09:20,825
     Well, I will tell you      
     that it is a Miracle       

165
00:09:20,926 --> 00:09:23,060
         That it hasn't         
    metastasized before now.    

166
00:09:23,161 --> 00:09:24,729
 This is...One special dog.     

167
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:27,765
     But if you want to         
     save her, it's gonna       

168
00:09:27,866 --> 00:09:29,000
     Have to happen soon.       

169
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:30,334
             Mom?               

170
00:09:30,435 --> 00:09:36,874
    Aw, sweetheart I wish we    
        could adopt her,        

171
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:41,779
 I really do. But we can't.     

172
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,881
         But we can pay         
     for the operation.         

173
00:09:43,982 --> 00:09:47,184
     I think you've made        
        the right choice.       

174
00:09:47,285 --> 00:09:49,320
        Oh, have I? Now,        
     who's gonna adopt a        

175
00:09:49,421 --> 00:09:50,554
        Three-legged dog?       

176
00:09:50,656 --> 00:09:53,424
 Oh, I don't know. How 'bout a  

177
00:09:53,525 --> 00:09:55,793
     Two-legged boy who         
         needs a friend?        

178
00:09:58,797 --> 00:10:00,031
         That's right.          

179
00:10:00,132 --> 00:10:02,133
     You sure? No charge?       

180
00:10:02,234 --> 00:10:03,734
 Not if you give her a home.    

181
00:10:03,836 --> 00:10:05,102
             Oh.                

182
00:10:05,203 --> 00:10:07,438
     I'll see what I can do.    

183
00:10:07,539 --> 00:10:09,573
        Okay charley, you       
     can have a couple more     

184
00:10:09,674 --> 00:10:11,042
        Minutes with her.       

185
00:10:11,143 --> 00:10:13,110
         (to Dr. Elliot)        
     doc, thanks a lot.         

186
00:10:13,211 --> 00:10:14,345
         You're welcome.        

187
00:10:14,446 --> 00:10:16,147
             Thanks.            

188
00:10:16,248 --> 00:10:18,582
     You...Are very welcome.    

189
00:10:18,684 --> 00:10:22,353
     You know, son, I wonder    
 what happened to her puppies.  

190
00:10:22,454 --> 00:10:23,787
         What puppies?          

191
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:25,489
 Oh, I noticed that last night. 

192
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:28,259
 She uh, she must have just     
 finished weaning a litter.     

193
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,493
         Really? Where?         

194
00:10:29,594 --> 00:10:31,728
     I don't know. Maybe        
     where you found her.       

195
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:32,964
         You think so?          

196
00:10:33,065 --> 00:10:34,766
     Seems like a pretty        
     good place to start.       

197
00:10:34,867 --> 00:10:37,401
 You're not sneezing today.     

198
00:10:37,502 --> 00:10:39,236
     You know, that's true.     

199
00:10:39,337 --> 00:10:42,006
    It's the strangest thing,   
     I-I'm not sick anymore.    

200
00:10:44,342 --> 00:10:45,910
     You brush your teeth?      

201
00:10:46,011 --> 00:10:47,045
             Twice.             

202
00:10:47,145 --> 00:10:48,746
     Want to take a ride        
    around the neighborhood?    

203
00:10:48,847 --> 00:10:50,815
         What for? I            
     don't know anybody.        

204
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:52,817
     Well, if you stay home,    
     you won't meet anybody.    

205
00:10:52,918 --> 00:10:55,519
     I-I just don't want to.    

206
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:56,788
            Charley-            

207
00:10:56,889 --> 00:10:58,956
     And what-what if they      
 don't want to play with me?    

208
00:10:59,058 --> 00:10:59,623
     But what if they do?       

209
00:10:59,724 --> 00:11:00,624
         What do I say?         

210
00:11:00,726 --> 00:11:02,960
        You say, "hello.        
     Hi, my name's charley".    

211
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:07,031
         Um, when will          
     our stuff be here?         

212
00:11:07,132 --> 00:11:08,800
    'bout four days. Listen,    
         sweetheart,            

213
00:11:08,901 --> 00:11:10,401
        We're all in the        
     same boat. Your dad,       

214
00:11:10,502 --> 00:11:12,636
         You, me, we're         
     all gonna get used to      

215
00:11:12,738 --> 00:11:14,305
     It. We're all gonna        
        make new friends.       

216
00:11:14,406 --> 00:11:16,841
     Yeah, easy for you         
     to say. You have a job.    

217
00:11:16,942 --> 00:11:18,242
        I've got my cell        
     phone with me. You can     

218
00:11:18,343 --> 00:11:20,211
        Call me every two       
     hours. And I love you.     

219
00:11:20,312 --> 00:11:21,445
        I love you, too.        

220
00:11:21,546 --> 00:11:22,780
        Keep your helmet        
     on. Don't you take it      

221
00:11:22,881 --> 00:11:24,115
         Off when you're        
        out of my sight.        

222
00:11:24,216 --> 00:11:25,549
        I won't. Ha! Ha!

244
00:12:58,043 --> 00:12:59,043
         Coming through!        

245
00:13:15,693 --> 00:13:18,262
        I've prepped her.       
     I've called radiology.     

246
00:13:18,363 --> 00:13:20,264
 I believe she's in stabilized  
         condition, sir.        

247
00:13:20,365 --> 00:13:22,266
         Okay, I want a         
    full set of x rays, fore    

248
00:13:22,367 --> 00:13:24,268
        And aft, anterior       
     and posterior knee,        

249
00:13:24,369 --> 00:13:27,271
 And uh, all quadrants, okay?   

250
00:13:27,372 --> 00:13:29,607
 Do we need to check for any    
 internal injuries, doctor?     

251
00:13:29,707 --> 00:13:30,942
        No, no, no, just        
            the knee.           

252
00:13:31,043 --> 00:13:32,910
     Allright? I'll get         
        everything ready.       

253
00:13:33,011 --> 00:13:35,046
     And one other thing.       
     It's very important.       

254
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:37,881
        Get me the score        
     of the browns game.        

255
00:13:37,982 --> 00:13:39,883
 Oh, I already checked that.    
 They're up by a touchdown.     

256
00:13:39,984 --> 00:13:43,954
         Well, my day's         
     looking better already.    

257
00:13:44,056 --> 00:13:45,522
         Sorry I'm late.        

258
00:13:45,624 --> 00:13:50,394
     Or maybe not. You're       
        too late, Malone.       

259
00:13:50,495 --> 00:13:51,629
             I am?              

260
00:13:51,729 --> 00:13:53,797
         No, she's going        
        to be all right.        

261
00:13:53,898 --> 00:13:56,367
     Cuts and abrasions and     
    a shattered left kneecap.   

262
00:13:56,468 --> 00:13:58,769
     All in all, I'd say        
 she's a pretty lucky lady.     

263
00:13:58,871 --> 00:14:02,239
 They flew her on life flight   
 just for a shattered kneecap?  

264
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:05,142
     This is Kelly Maguire,     
         one of the top         

265
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:08,880
    Ten tennis players in the   
    world. They want the best   
     orthopedic surgeon         

266
00:14:08,981 --> 00:14:10,915
         In the country.        
        Which reminds me.       

267
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:14,751
 You know, you've got wonderful 
 instincts as a resident, and...

268
00:14:14,853 --> 00:14:17,154
 ...I think you're going to     
 be a really good doctor...     

269
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:19,323
     ...But you've gotta        
     stop forgetting the        

270
00:14:19,424 --> 00:14:21,259
     Fundamentals! I mean,      
         when you're on         

271
00:14:21,359 --> 00:14:23,094
     Duty, you've gotta         
     remain in the area!        

272
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:25,696
 I don't want to have to call   
 my residents more than once!   

273
00:14:25,797 --> 00:14:27,198
     I know, I'm sorry.         
     When I got the page-       

274
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:28,432
     Sorry doesn't cut it!      

275
00:14:28,533 --> 00:14:30,201
            Yes, sir.           

276
00:14:30,302 --> 00:14:31,435
     There's another thing      
     you've gotta learn.        

277
00:14:31,536 --> 00:14:33,204
     The art of diplomacy.      

278
00:14:33,305 --> 00:14:34,872
             I do?              

279
00:14:34,973 --> 00:14:38,542
 Yes. Dr. Kay and I want you to 
 go and greet our new medical   
         researcher.            

280
00:14:38,643 --> 00:14:42,513
 His name is Ben Logan. And     
     I don't want him to        

281
00:14:42,614 --> 00:14:43,847
         Feel like he's         
         been forgotten.        

282
00:14:43,948 --> 00:14:45,316
     I've actually read         
     some of his research       

283
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:47,218
         That he did for        
     uh, Boston children's.     

284
00:14:47,319 --> 00:14:48,219
         That's the guy.        

285
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,220
             Okay.              

286
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:50,254
     Now, go. And remember!     

287
00:14:50,355 --> 00:14:53,057
         Fundamentals.          

288
00:14:53,158 --> 00:14:55,092
         Right, right.          

289
00:15:01,499 --> 00:15:02,399
         Dr. Logan.             

290
00:15:02,501 --> 00:15:03,400
             Yes?               

291
00:15:03,501 --> 00:15:05,402
     Andy Malone. Welcome       
         to the clinic.         

292
00:15:05,503 --> 00:15:07,404
         Thanks. Good to        
     be here. Resident?         

293
00:15:07,505 --> 00:15:09,406
     Ah, yes, actually.         
         Six months next        

294
00:15:09,507 --> 00:15:12,075
        Week. I've heard        
     quite a bit about you.     

295
00:15:12,177 --> 00:15:13,177
            All lies.           

296
00:15:13,278 --> 00:15:15,479
     Right, right, right.       
    I actually read the paper   

297
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:17,548
 You presented to the Boston    
     children's clinic.         

298
00:15:17,649 --> 00:15:20,551
 "minimal invasive thoracic     
     surgery techniques for     
         newborns."             

299
00:15:20,652 --> 00:15:21,885
     It's pretty impressive.    

300
00:15:21,986 --> 00:15:23,554
         Thank you.             

301
00:15:23,655 --> 00:15:26,557
        Yeah. You're here       
     on a research Grant,       
        is that correct?        

302
00:15:26,658 --> 00:15:28,792
     Yeah, convalescent and     
        rehab strategies.       

303
00:15:28,893 --> 00:15:30,127
     Yeah, what disciplines?    

304
00:15:30,228 --> 00:15:32,263
     Pretty much everything     
         from oncology          
        to brain surgery.       

305
00:15:32,364 --> 00:15:34,331
     Sounds like you've         
         got the run            
        of the hospital.        

306
00:15:34,432 --> 00:15:38,068
 Well, yeah. Any patient that's 
in rehab or convalescing is fair
             game.              

307
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:42,806
     Actually, this is me,      
        but uh, it was a        
     pleasure to meet you.      

308
00:15:42,907 --> 00:15:44,475
     If you need anything,      
     please just holler.        

309
00:15:44,576 --> 00:15:45,576
    Well, thank you. I will.    

310
00:15:49,914 --> 00:15:51,148
         Dr. Logan.             

311
00:15:51,249 --> 00:15:52,483
            Uh, yeah.           

312
00:15:52,584 --> 00:15:53,584
         Oh, Dr. Kay!           

313
00:15:53,685 --> 00:15:54,585
     Hi, good to see you.       

314
00:15:54,686 --> 00:15:55,586
         You, too, sir.         

315
00:15:55,687 --> 00:15:56,587
     How's everything going?    

316
00:15:56,688 --> 00:15:58,054
     Just fine, thank you.      

317
00:15:58,156 --> 00:15:59,256
     Listen, let me know        
     if there's anything        
        I can do for you.       

318
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:01,359
         Yes, sir, I            
        will. Thank you.        

319
00:16:04,028 --> 00:16:05,796
         Good morning.          

320
00:16:05,897 --> 00:16:06,897
         Hey, Leeza.            

321
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,601
        Is she here yet?        

322
00:16:10,702 --> 00:16:12,035
             Yes.               

323
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,139
             Hi.                

324
00:16:16,241 --> 00:16:17,141
Hi.                             

325
00:16:17,242 --> 00:16:18,475
         Welcome to the         
     Cleveland clinic. I'm      

326
00:16:18,577 --> 00:16:19,910
     Leeza Madison, your        
    administrative assistant.   

327
00:16:20,011 --> 00:16:22,045
     Well, hi. It's nice        
        to meet you. I'm        

328
00:16:22,146 --> 00:16:23,647
     Glad you're here. Can      
        you tell me where       

329
00:16:23,748 --> 00:16:24,781
     The overnights are?        

330
00:16:24,882 --> 00:16:28,051
         Oh, right here.        
 Alphabetical, by departments.  

331
00:16:28,152 --> 00:16:29,053
             Thanks.            

332
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:30,287
         You're welcome.        

333
00:16:30,388 --> 00:16:32,323
    Guess I have to get up to   
 speed on the routine here.     

334
00:16:32,424 --> 00:16:33,357
         Oh, you will.          

335
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:35,026
    Your husband's here on a    
     research Grant, right?     

336
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:38,562
     Yeah. He took the Grant    
    so we could be together.    

337
00:16:46,838 --> 00:16:48,339
     Okay, stay in front        
         of the ball.           

338
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,874
        Keep in front of        
         the ball. Oww!         

339
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:58,616
     Atta boy. Nice catch!      

340
00:16:58,716 --> 00:17:01,185
     Double play! All right!    

341
00:17:36,554 --> 00:17:37,921
     You charley Logan?         

342
00:17:38,022 --> 00:17:40,257
         Um ... Maybe.          

343
00:17:40,358 --> 00:17:42,726
        Your mom asked me       
     to give you this note.     

344
00:17:44,596 --> 00:17:45,929
             Okay.              

345
00:17:47,466 --> 00:17:49,900
     Do you know where this     
     um, waiting room is?       

346
00:17:50,001 --> 00:17:52,068
     Mm-hm. Third floor,        
        out the elevator,       

347
00:17:52,169 --> 00:17:54,070
     Hang a left, about         
     halfway down the hall.     

348
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:02,779
            You lost?           

349
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:03,780
Hi.                             

350
00:18:03,882 --> 00:18:04,781
                             Hi.

351
00:18:04,882 --> 00:18:05,883
             No.                

352
00:18:06,884 --> 00:18:08,552
     Maybe. Maybe, yeah.        

353
00:18:08,653 --> 00:18:10,554
 I'm gonna take that as a yes.  

354
00:18:10,655 --> 00:18:14,491
        My mom said there       
     was an empty waiting       
     room on this floor.        

355
00:18:14,592 --> 00:18:15,759
     Yeah, who's your mom?      

356
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:17,261
         Terry Logan?           

357
00:18:17,362 --> 00:18:18,862
        Ah, the assistant       
         administrator.         

358
00:18:18,963 --> 00:18:22,032
     That means your dad        
        is Dr. Ben Logan.       

359
00:18:22,133 --> 00:18:23,434
        How did you know?       

360
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:25,001
     I'm gifted that way.       

361
00:18:25,103 --> 00:18:26,837
     Are there patients         
         on this floor?         

362
00:18:26,938 --> 00:18:30,974
 Yeah. This is actually, the    
 geriatric convalescent ward.   

363
00:18:33,311 --> 00:18:34,210

491
00:29:16,187 --> 00:29:17,420
         Would you care         
     for something, madam?      

492
00:29:17,521 --> 00:29:20,523
 Oh, uh, just tea ... Edward.   

493
00:29:42,379 --> 00:29:43,613
         Oh, Albert.            

494
00:29:43,714 --> 00:29:49,285
     Albert, I wish you were    
 here. I need your strength.    

495
00:29:49,387 --> 00:29:53,056
     I don't know ... That      
     I can face this alone.     

496
00:30:01,098 --> 00:30:02,232
     Shall I pour, madam?       

497
00:30:02,333 --> 00:30:05,001
    Uh, yes, please, Edward.    

498
00:30:06,604 --> 00:30:09,172
 I brought your medication.     

499
00:30:09,273 --> 00:30:10,440
        I don't want it.        

500
00:30:10,541 --> 00:30:12,175
         Yes, I know.           

501
00:30:12,276 --> 00:30:13,910
        I won't take it.        

502
00:30:15,446 --> 00:30:16,346
         As you wish.           

503
00:30:16,447 --> 00:30:18,281
        Why do you stay?        

504
00:30:18,382 --> 00:30:21,451
    Habit, I suppose, madam.    

505
00:30:21,552 --> 00:30:24,287
     Well, that's a fine        
         thing to say to        

506
00:30:24,388 --> 00:30:26,822
        Your employer of        
     twenty-five years.         

507
00:30:26,923 --> 00:30:29,860
     I've noticed it matters    
    little what I say to you.   

508
00:30:29,961 --> 00:30:32,428
            Get out.            

509
00:30:32,529 --> 00:30:35,565
     As you wish. Will there    
        be anything else?       

510
00:30:35,666 --> 00:30:36,566
             No!                

511
00:30:36,667 --> 00:30:37,901
         Mrs. Mannion...        

512
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:39,335
             What?              

513
00:30:39,437 --> 00:30:41,438
 You know, being alone is ...   

514
00:30:43,107 --> 00:30:45,641
    It's a matter of choice.    

515
00:31:21,678 --> 00:31:25,014
        Stay here and be        
     quiet. I'm gonna go        
         get your mom.          

516
00:32:19,803 --> 00:32:23,473
     Come on, Annie. Let's      
     go. We're leaving.         

517
00:32:51,468 --> 00:32:54,104
     Come on, guys! Let's       
         go! Let's go!          

518
00:33:03,981 --> 00:33:07,183
     Come on! Come on! Let's    
     go! Come on! Come on!      

519
00:33:45,756 --> 00:33:46,823
     What is she doing?         

520
00:33:46,923 --> 00:33:49,759
         She likes you.         

521
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:52,462
    What happened to her leg?   

522
00:33:52,563 --> 00:33:55,097
Cancer. They had                
 to amputate it.                

523
00:33:55,198 --> 00:33:57,333
        Kind of like me.        

524
00:33:57,434 --> 00:34:00,103
    You still have your leg.    

525
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:01,537
        Yeah, well, they        
     may as well have cut       

526
00:34:01,639 --> 00:34:02,972
         It off. I can't        
     play tennis anymore.       

527
00:34:03,073 --> 00:34:04,307
     Oh, you play tennis?       

528
00:34:04,408 --> 00:34:05,308
             I did.             

529
00:34:05,409 --> 00:34:07,277
     Well, what happened?       

530
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:11,247
         Car accident.          
     Shattered my knee.         

531
00:34:11,348 --> 00:34:12,482
         It'll heal.            

532
00:34:12,583 --> 00:34:14,950
         Yeah, but I'll         
    never play tennis again.    

533
00:34:15,051 --> 00:34:16,853
     Do something else.         

534
00:34:18,856 --> 00:34:21,424
         I have to go.          

535
00:34:25,429 --> 00:34:27,129
        What's her name?        

536
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:28,131
             Annie.             

537
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:30,467
         You understand,        
        don't you Annie?        

538
00:34:30,567 --> 00:34:33,269
 She knows what people need.    

539
00:34:33,370 --> 00:34:36,839
        What's your name?       

540
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:38,007
         I'm charley.           

541
00:34:38,109 --> 00:34:41,010
     Hi, charley. I'm Kelly.    

542
00:34:41,111 --> 00:34:44,580
     Hi. She really does        
     know what people need.     

543
00:34:44,681 --> 00:34:47,950
         I believe you.         

544
00:34:48,051 --> 00:34:51,754
             Bye.               

545
00:34:58,129 --> 00:35:01,130
    She needs a dog like you.   

546
00:35:11,942 --> 00:35:13,008
         Do you mind?           

547
00:35:13,109 --> 00:35:15,478
         Uh, no. No. No,        
         no, no, no.            

548
00:35:16,613 --> 00:35:18,515
            Meniscus.           

549
00:35:18,615 --> 00:35:19,582
         It's a little          
     bit more than that.        

550
00:35:19,683 --> 00:35:20,583
            Kneecap?            

551
00:35:20,684 --> 00:35:22,318
        It's a car crash.       
         What are you, a        

552
00:35:22,419 --> 00:35:23,653
     Physical therapist?        

553
00:35:23,754 --> 00:35:27,222
    Doctor. I--resident. I'm    
    at the Cleveland clinic.    

554
00:35:27,324 --> 00:35:29,024
        You know, I know        
     some great exercises.      

555
00:35:29,125 --> 00:35:30,726
        We can-we can get       
     you back up to speed.      

556
00:35:30,827 --> 00:35:31,994
         Not the speed          
     that I was used to.        

557
00:35:32,095 --> 00:35:33,363
     What were you used to?     

558
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:35,230
             Tennis.            

559
00:35:35,332 --> 00:35:36,232
         Is that so?            

560
00:35:36,333 --> 00:35:39,902
         I know you.            
     You're Kelly Maguire.      

561
00:35:40,003 --> 00:35:43,038
 You're the number one seed     
    from the emergency room.    

562
00:35:43,139 --> 00:35:46,509
         Was. I was the         
        number one seed.        

563
00:35:46,610 --> 00:35:49,011
     You know, I was serious    
     about the exercises.       

564
00:35:49,112 --> 00:35:50,480
     Thanks, but I think        
     I'm getting all the        

565
00:35:50,581 --> 00:35:51,714
        Help that I need.       

566
00:35:51,815 --> 00:35:55,418
    You know, sometimes it's    
 better to get a little bit of  

567
00:35:55,519 --> 00:35:57,587
        Help at the right       
     time, than a lot of        

568
00:35:57,688 --> 00:35:58,521
     Help at the wrong time.    

569
00:35:58,622 --> 00:36:01,457
 What were you thinking of?     

570
00:36:01,558 --> 00:36:02,525
             Lunch.             

571
00:36:02,626 --> 00:36:04,961
 I meant about the exercises.   

572
00:36:05,061 --> 00:36:08,298
     So did I. I thought        
     we could discuss it        

573
00:36:08,399 --> 00:36:09,532
         Over lunch.            

574
00:36:09,633 --> 00:36:12,835
     Let me guess, this is      
 "take a gimp to lunch" week.   

575
00:36:12,936 --> 00:36:15,638
     The ballpark. South        
         of the center.         

576
00:36:15,739 --> 00:36:19,942
     I will bring you lunch.    
        Say one o'clock?        

577
00:36:20,043 --> 00:36:22,845
 One o'clock. Don't be late.    

578
00:36:31,755 --> 00:36:33,055
             Hey, get back in   
             there! Stay! Over  
                there! Come on! 

579
00:36:33,156 --> 00:36:35,057
     Get in there! Stay,        
         stay. No! No!          

580
00:36:35,158 --> 00:36:38,160
     Get in! Move back in       
     there. Come on. Stay!      

581
00:36:43,166 --> 00:36:44,434
     What are you doing?        

582
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:46,168
    You can't come down here!   

583
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:48,504
         I-I'm sorry.           

584
00:36:48,606 --> 00:36:49,772
         I-I didn't-            

585
00:36:49,873 --> 00:36:51,474
     Get your tail outta        
         here right now.        

586
00:36:51,575 --> 00:36:54,544
             Now!               

587
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:57,480
         What's this?           

588
00:36:57,581 --> 00:37:00,082
             A dog.             

589
00:37:00,183 --> 00:37:01,316
     I know it's a dog.         

590
00:37:01,418 --> 00:37:03,118
 What's it doing down here?     

591
00:37:03,219 --> 00:37:05,287
         It's with me.          

592
00:37:05,388 --> 00:37:07,056
        And who are you?        

593
00:37:07,157 --> 00:37:08,791
        I'm charley. I'm        
     trying to save them.       

594
00:37:08,892 --> 00:37:10,360
     Save them from what?       

595
00:37:10,461 --> 00:37:11,594
         Being killed.          

596
00:37:11,695 --> 00:37:12,862
         What do you            
     mean, being killed?        

597
00:37:12,963 --> 00:37:16,866
     Killed put to sleep,       
         s-simonized?           

598
00:37:16,967 --> 00:37:19,869
     Somebody's gonna wax       
         them to death?         

599
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:21,637
 Uh, yeah, may--I don't know!   

600
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:28,478
     Ah, excellent. Do they     
 show all the surgical suites?  

601
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:29,912
            All five.           

602
00:37:30,013 --> 00:37:31,013
        Uh-huh. Well, I'm       
     going to need to have      

603
00:37:31,114 --> 00:37:32,315
     A camera in one of the     
     convalescent areas.        

604
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:33,549
     Uh, how many people?       

605
00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:34,784
     About half a dozen.        

606
00:37:34,885 --> 00:37:37,219
        Okay, I could set       
         the room up for        

607
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,655
         Video. When do         
         we do this?            

608
00:37:38,755 --> 00:37:41,156
         Next week. I'm         
     sorry for the short        

609
00:37:41,257 --> 00:37:42,925
        Notice, but I was       
    just told by Dr. Ecklin.    

610
00:37:43,026 --> 00:37:44,594
         You know him?          

611
00:37:44,695 --> 00:37:46,829
        Yeah, I know him.       

612
00:37:46,930 --> 00:37:48,398
         Uh-huh. Well, I        
     just uh, found out from    

613
00:37:48,499 --> 00:37:49,065
        A memo. Actually,       
     I've not met him yet.      

614
00:37:49,165 --> 00:37:50,400
            You will.           

615
00:37:50,501 --> 00:37:52,402
         Uh-huh. Well, I        
     need to be able to         

616
00:37:52,503 --> 00:37:54,737
         Show, uh rehab,        
     some of the different      

617
00:37:54,838 --> 00:37:56,406
     Procedures, operating      
         techniques,            

618
00:37:56,507 --> 00:37:58,173
     Pretty much anything       
         that has to do         

619
00:37:58,275 --> 00:38:01,310
 With post-op or post-traumatic 
     uh, convalescence.         

620
00:38:01,411 --> 00:38:02,478
            Got that?           

621
00:38:02,579 --> 00:38:03,813
         No, but I will.        

622
00:38:03,914 --> 00:38:05,147
    Good man. Any questions?    

623
00:38:05,248 --> 00:38:06,482
            No, sir.            

624
00:38:06,583 --> 00:38:09,051
    Aha. Good. Well, uh, you    
    can stop calling me sir.    

625
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:11,087
         I keep thinking        
         my dad's here.         

626
00:38:17,761 --> 00:38:20,697
        Oh, look at you.        
     Look at you. Yeah.         

627
00:38:28,204 --> 00:38:29,772
        Oh, hey, charley.       

628
00:38:29,873 --> 00:38:31,774
 Cute little dudes, ain't they? 

629
00:38:31,875 --> 00:38:33,109
     Yeah. You have a dog?      

630
00:38:33,209 --> 00:38:35,344
 I did once. A long time ago.   

631
00:38:35,445 --> 00:38:37,279
        What's your name?       

632
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:39,115
 Didn't I already tell you?     

633
00:38:39,215 --> 00:38:41,517
         No, you were           
        too busy yelling.       

634
00:38:41,618 --> 00:38:42,918
         Yeah, right.           

635
00:38:43,019 --> 00:38:44,920
         My name's C.W.         

636
00:38:45,021 --> 00:38:47,657
             Huh?               

637
00:38:47,758 --> 00:38:51,661
        C.W. Like the two       
        letters, c and w.       

638
00:38:51,762 --> 00:38:53,663
         Well, does it          
     stand for something?       

639
00:38:53,764 --> 00:38:55,464
         Of course it           
     stands for somethin'.      

640
00:38:55,566 --> 00:38:59,468
     Carter Wyatt. What's       
         your last name?        

641
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:01,003
Logan.                          

642
00:39:01,104 --> 00:39:02,438
                         Logan? 

643
00:39:02,539 --> 00:39:05,440
     You mean like the new      
 assistant administrator Logan? 

644
00:39:05,542 --> 00:39:06,976
     Yeah, that's my mom.       

645
00:39:07,077 --> 00:39:11,480
 Listen, you've got to get these
     mutts out of here.         

646
00:39:11,582 --> 00:39:13,816
 And don't you tell your mom    
 about this do you understand?  

647
00:39:13,917 --> 00:39:14,817
            I won't.            

648
00:39:14,918 --> 00:39:15,851
         You better not.        

649
00:39:15,953 --> 00:39:19,288
         She's kind of a        
     Miracle dog, you know?     

650
00:39:19,389 --> 00:39:21,090
     What kind of miracles?     

651
00:39:21,191 --> 00:39:24,860
         Well she makes         
     people ... Better.         

652
00:39:24,961 --> 00:39:27,196
     Yeah? What do you mean?    

653
00:39:27,297 --> 00:39:31,233
         Like she makes         
     'em do nice stuff?         

654
00:39:31,334 --> 00:39:34,904
    No. Like, if you're sick    
     and you touch Annie,       
     you'll get better.         

655
00:39:35,005 --> 00:39:36,572
         It-it's true.          

656
00:39:36,673 --> 00:39:37,907
        See this scratch        
         right here?            

657
00:39:38,008 --> 00:39:39,909
     Annie licked it and        
     now it's all better.       

658
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:42,011
             Really?            

659
00:39:42,112 --> 00:39:47,016
     Well, uh, listen, you      
    best get out of here now.   

660
00:39:47,117 --> 00:39:48,350
             Okay.              

661
00:39:48,452 --> 00:39:49,351
        See you, charley.       

662
00:39:49,452 --> 00:39:51,120
             Bye.               

663
00:40:27,691 --> 00:40:29,258
             Hi.                

664
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:33,763
    So ... What's for lunch?    

665
00:40:33,864 --> 00:40:38,267
        To begin we have        
 a wild green salad, with...    

666
00:40:38,368 --> 00:40:40,369
 ...Bistro-grilled chicken.     

667
00:40:40,471 --> 00:40:42,038
         You're kidding.        

668
00:40:42,138 --> 00:40:44,707
     Come on, he resets         
     elbows, he cooks...        

669
00:40:44,808 --> 00:40:47,609
     Maybe I should have        
     broken both my knees.      

670
00:40:47,711 --> 00:40:52,181
    A little garlic, a little   
 onion, some papas fritas...    

671
00:40:52,282 --> 00:40:55,417
 They're pan-fried potatoes.    

672
00:40:55,518 --> 00:40:59,388
     And then for dessert we    
 have a little crme brle.    

673
00:40:59,489 --> 00:41:01,857
         I'm impressed.         

674
00:41:01,958 --> 00:41:03,558
        As you should be.       

675
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:07,462
         How's the knee?        

676
00:41:07,563 --> 00:41:12,935
     Uh, it's better. Uh,       
     a lot better, actually.    

677
00:41:13,036 --> 00:41:15,104
        We'll have you on       
 the court here in no time.     

678
00:41:15,205 --> 00:41:17,873
 Yeah, well, I won't exactly    
     be playing Monica Seles    

679
00:41:17,974 --> 00:41:20,510
     Tomorrow, but--but         
     uh, but it's better.       

680
00:41:20,611 --> 00:41:21,777
            I'm glad.           

681
00:41:24,447 --> 00:41:26,516
        Why did you want        
     to have lunch with me?     

682
00:41:26,617 --> 00:41:28,551
     Well, I was hungry.        

683
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:31,287
 Ask a silly question and...    

684
00:41:31,387 --> 00:41:33,923
     I thought I could help.    

685
00:41:34,024 --> 00:41:36,191
             Why me?            

686
00:41:36,292 --> 00:41:40,429
 Because you're prettier than   
 most of the patients I see.    

687
00:41:43,433 --> 00:41:46,001
     Tennis was my life.        

688
00:41:46,103 --> 00:41:47,737
             I know.            

689
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:48,804
        I can handle it.        

690
00:41:48,906 --> 00:41:49,805
             I know.            

691
00:41:49,906 --> 00:41:51,673
         I just thought         
        that maybe you'd        

692
00:41:51,775 --> 00:41:52,909
        Like some company       
     while you're doing it.     

693
00:41:53,009 --> 00:41:55,711
     I don't need another       
         disappointment.        

694
00:41:55,812 --> 00:41:59,614
     Is that what I am, just    
     another disappointment?    

695
00:41:59,716 --> 00:42:01,450
            Not yet.            

696
00:42:01,551 --> 00:42:02,785
            Not ever.           

697
00:42:04,788 --> 00:42:07,189
         We'll see.             

698
00:43:02,412 --> 00:43:05,414
         Hey, girl, what        
     are you doing here?        

699
00:43:27,237 --> 00:43:29,571
        Hey, Eddie, send        
     security up to the ICU     

700
00:43:29,672 --> 00:43:31,573
 On the first floor, will you?  

701
00:43:31,674 --> 00:43:35,210
     I think there's an         
     animal on the floor.       

702
00:43:35,311 --> 00:43:37,446
        Uh, I don't know.       
         Maybe a dog.           

703
00:43:37,547 --> 00:43:40,049
        Yes, I know a dog       
         when I see one,        

704
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:42,517
        But this one had        
     three legs, I think.       

705
00:43:42,619 --> 00:43:49,291
 No, wise guy, it is not a UFO. 
    Just send security, okay?   

706
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:17,953
    Hey, Chad, how you doin'?   

707
00:44:18,054 --> 00:44:18,954
             Good.              

708
00:44:19,056 --> 00:44:20,355
    Aren't you still in pain?   

709
00:44:20,456 --> 00:44:23,625
 No, my leg feels great, doc.   

710
00:44:23,726 --> 00:44:25,227
        It's kinda like I       
     could run out of here      

711
00:44:25,328 --> 00:44:27,162
         All the way to         
     the football field.        

712
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:29,899
     Well, not yet, but,        
     hmmm, you're close.        

713
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:34,469
 And I can't figure out why.    
 How's your range of motion?    

714
00:44:34,570 --> 00:44:40,609
     Great. It's almost         
     like, uh ... A Miracle.    

715
00:44:40,711 --> 00:44:44,079
 Yeah, that's amazing all right.
     You want a Miracle?        

716
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:46,081
        Get me tickets on       
     the fifty-yard line.       

717
00:44:46,182 --> 00:44:47,249
        That's a Miracle.       

718
00:44:47,350 --> 00:44:48,718
         You got it.            

719
00:44:51,154 --> 00:44:53,989
 Oh, Leeza! Leeza let me talk to
        you for a minute.       

720
00:44:54,090 --> 00:44:56,158
         Are you feeling        
     okay, Dr. Marchant?        

721
00:44:56,259 --> 00:44:58,393
 I feel fine. It's Chad Ripley. 

722
00:44:58,494 --> 00:45:01,763
 He's recovering too fast, and  
    I just can't explain it.    

723
00:45:01,864 --> 00:45:03,598
         The man's just         
    gettin' better, I guess.    

724
00:45:03,699 --> 00:45:06,235
 Well, nobody heals that fast,  
     not even superman.         

725
00:45:06,336 --> 00:45:09,638
    Let me ask you something.   

726
00:45:09,739 --> 00:45:11,640
        Have you noticed        
     anything peculiar or       

727
00:45:11,741 --> 00:45:13,008
 Strange going on around here?  

728
00:45:13,110 --> 00:45:15,410
         Other than the         
        usual mayhem? No.       

729
00:45:15,512 --> 00:45:17,179
             Huh.               

730
00:45:18,849 --> 00:45:20,449
         Good morning.          

731
00:45:20,550 --> 00:45:21,750
     You're gonna love this.    

732
00:45:21,851 --> 00:45:23,752
         Oh, yeah? What?        

733
00:45:23,853 --> 00:45:28,123
     A mysterious animal        
     around the hospital.       

734
00:45:28,224 --> 00:45:30,459
     And get this ... It        
         had three legs.        

735
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:32,795
     Oh, yeah? How many         
     heads did it have?         

736
00:45:32,896 --> 00:45:34,129
     Just one, I think.         

737
00:45:34,230 --> 00:45:36,365
(hums the "twilight zone" theme)
     do-do-do-do-do-do-do.      

738
00:45:36,466 --> 00:45:38,801
     Welcome to area 51.        

739
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:40,803
 And by the time security got   
    there, some old guy with    

740
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:44,073
 Congestive heart failure had   
 made a miraculous recovery.    

741
00:45:44,174 --> 00:45:45,674
             Really?            

742
00:45:45,775 --> 00:45:47,909
        Somebody needs to       
         call Oprah.            

743
00:45:48,011 --> 00:45:49,611
         No, no, don't          
         you call Oprah.        

744
00:45:49,712 --> 00:45:52,447
    Call the custodian. Tell    
     him I need to see him.     

745
00:45:52,548 --> 00:45:54,449
         I'll find him.         

746
00:45:54,550 --> 00:45:56,551
             Okay.              

747
00:45:59,122 --> 00:46:00,022
             Hey!               

748
00:46:00,123 --> 00:46:01,023
             Hey!               

749
00:46:01,124 --> 00:46:02,758
        I cannot believe        
    how fast you're healing.    

750
00:46:02,859 --> 00:46:04,360
         I don't know,          
        it's weird, huh?        

751
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:06,862
     It's spooky. I mean,       
        you blew out your       

752
00:46:06,963 --> 00:46:08,397
 Anterior crucial ligament,     
         and all of a           

753
00:46:08,498 --> 00:46:09,999
 Sudden it's reconstructing,    
         like by itself.        

754
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:11,300
         I had surgery.         

755
00:46:11,401 --> 00:46:12,968
     Nah, only to reattach.     

756
00:46:13,069 --> 00:46:15,670
         Anyway, I gotta        
    get to physical therapy.    

757
00:46:15,771 --> 00:46:18,107
     Right, yeah. You've        
     gotta keep that up.        

758
00:46:18,208 --> 00:46:20,976
        You'll be playing       
 Wimbledon here by next month.  

759
00:46:21,077 --> 00:46:24,079
     I don't know about         
     that, but, uh, maybe       

760
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:26,015
     Back on the court, huh?    

761
00:46:26,116 --> 00:46:28,250
    Um, I'll call you later.    

762
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:29,418
             Yeah.              

763
00:46:29,519 --> 00:46:30,685
             Okay.              

764
00:46:37,527 --> 00:47:09,191
             [  %%  ]              

765
00:47:09,292 --> 00:47:12,361
     Um, have you seen a        
 little boy about yea high?     

766
00:47:12,462 --> 00:47:14,696
            No, sir.            

767
00:47:14,797 --> 00:47:17,799
        No? Okay, thanks.       

768
00:47:25,841 --> 00:47:29,144
     What you doin' here        
         during the day?        

769
00:47:29,246 --> 00:47:30,379
 I had to feed the puppies.     

770
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:31,647
         Well, I'll feed        
         the puppies.           

771
00:47:31,747 --> 00:47:33,682
     I got some food for 'em    
     up in the cafeteria.       

772
00:47:33,783 --> 00:47:35,384
        You know, people        
     notice a kid like you      

773
00:47:35,485 --> 00:47:37,319
         Roamin' around,        
         you know that?         

774
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:40,722
     I'll tell you what         
     you gotta do, though,      

775
00:47:40,823 --> 00:47:43,492
     You have got to find       
     a home for these little    
     fellas, and quick.         

776
00:47:43,593 --> 00:47:45,960
         I know. I just         
    need a little more time.    

777
00:47:46,062 --> 00:47:47,962
        Well, you've got        
 'til the end of the month.     

778
00:47:48,064 --> 00:47:49,298
         That's it.             

779
00:47:49,399 --> 00:47:50,632
         I'll try, CW.          

780
00:47:50,733 --> 00:47:52,067
         All right.             

781
00:47:55,538 --> 00:47:57,172
         How come you           
        don't like dogs?        

782
00:47:57,274 --> 00:47:59,174
     I never said that.         

783
00:47:59,276 --> 00:48:01,710
     Yeah, well, you never      
     said you did like 'em.     

784
00:48:01,811 --> 00:48:03,279
     You don't have one.        

785
00:48:03,379 --> 00:48:07,416
        So ... Why don't        
         you have a dog?        

786
00:48:07,517 --> 00:48:09,518
     I had one ... Once.        

787
00:48:11,887 --> 00:48:12,721
         Did it die?            

788
00:48:12,822 --> 00:48:15,490
             Yeah.              

789
00:48:15,591 --> 00:48:17,693
         Five years ago.        

790
00:48:17,793 --> 00:48:19,394
     His name was Horace.       

791
00:48:19,495 --> 00:48:23,832
     He was a mutt. He sure     
    loved to ride in the car.   

792
00:48:23,933 --> 00:48:25,834
         They all do.           

793
00:48:25,935 --> 00:48:28,470
    How did he die? Old age?    

794
00:48:28,571 --> 00:48:30,038
            No, uh...           

795
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:32,541
     I was just heading         
     down to the grocery        

796
00:48:32,642 --> 00:48:34,476
        Store, and Horace       
        was sittin' right       

797
00:48:34,577 --> 00:48:37,112
         Next to me, and        
     he jumped in the back      

798
00:48:37,213 --> 00:48:39,348
        Seat with my boy,       
        Dwight, and he'd        

799
00:48:39,449 --> 00:48:42,451
 Just, uh, turned twenty-five.  

800
00:48:42,552 --> 00:48:47,689
        We was up on the        
 I-90 and, all of a sudden,     

801
00:48:47,790 --> 00:48:50,125
    Horace, he starts barkin'   
     like nobody's business.    

802
00:48:50,226 --> 00:48:53,662
     And I turned around        
 to look what was goin' on,     

803
00:48:53,763 --> 00:48:57,666
 And this truck had pulled up   
 behind us and this dog was     

804
00:48:57,767 --> 00:49:02,204
     Leaning out the window     
     and Horace was just        
     lettin' me know, and       

805
00:49:02,305 --> 00:49:04,606
    Maybe he was just sayin'    
    hello to that other dog.    

806
00:49:04,707 --> 00:49:08,042
     I don't know. I took       
    my eyes off the road for    

807
00:49:08,144 --> 00:49:10,379
        Just a second. I        
     mean, it was just a        

808
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:14,984
        Split second. And       
     Dwight, he-he sees         

809
00:49:15,085 --> 00:49:16,651
     Somethin' coming up        
     ahead and he yells         

810
00:49:16,752 --> 00:49:18,453
        At me and I turn        
     around real quick, but     

811
00:49:18,555 --> 00:49:21,456
 ... It wasn't quick enough.    

812
00:49:21,557 --> 00:49:27,829
    There's no way I could've   
 missed that station wagon.     

813
00:49:27,930 --> 00:49:30,165
 Plowed right into it, head on. 

814
00:49:30,266 --> 00:49:32,767
     I never seen nothin'       
        like it, I mean,        

815
00:49:32,868 --> 00:49:35,237
         Everything went        
         black as night.        

816
00:49:35,338 --> 00:49:43,978
 When I woke up, I was right    
    here in the hospital ...    

817
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:45,080
 And, uh, m'back was broken,    

818
00:49:45,181 --> 00:49:46,415
         My spleen was          
        ruptured, so they       

819
00:49:46,516 --> 00:49:48,350
     Told me. I-I don't         
     remember much of that.     

820
00:49:48,451 --> 00:49:56,725
 But ... Horace ... Dwight ...  

821
00:50:01,197 --> 00:50:02,864
         I'm sorry.             

822
00:50:04,234 --> 00:50:09,438
     Yeah, well, listen         
     ... I gotta get back       

823
00:50:09,539 --> 00:50:12,307
        To work, and uh,        
     you know, so do you.       

824
00:50:12,408 --> 00:50:15,177
     You have got to find       
 a place for these puppies.     

825
00:50:15,278 --> 00:50:18,480
         I will, CW.            

826
00:50:18,581 --> 00:50:23,218
     I know you will. You're    
     a good boy, charley.       

827
00:50:23,319 --> 00:50:27,389
 Now you skedaddle outta here.  

828
00:50:43,073 --> 00:50:44,973
         You know, since        
     I been seein' you,         

829
00:50:45,075 --> 00:50:47,409
        My backaches have       
     absolutely stopped.        

830
00:50:47,510 --> 00:50:51,413
        Is he right about       
         you being one          
     of those Miracle dogs?     

831
00:50:51,514 --> 00:50:54,182
             Huh?               

832
00:50:54,284 --> 00:50:56,785
     Bark the truth now.        

833
00:50:57,854 --> 00:50:59,088
     Thank you, Mr. Crawford.    

834
00:50:59,189 --> 00:51:04,092
         (announcer)            
        IV nurse to PCU.        
        IV nurse to PCU.        

835
00:51:04,193 --> 00:51:06,060
             (kiss)             

836
00:51:06,161 --> 00:51:07,429
    What are you doing here?    

837
00:51:07,530 --> 00:51:10,899
 I heard about this mysterious  
 night visitor. What is it?     

838
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,133
        Well, you got me.       

839
00:51:12,234 --> 00:51:15,370
    Mr. Crawford says it's a    
     dog ... A Miracle dog.     

840
00:51:15,472 --> 00:51:16,672
     Only has three legs.       

841
00:51:16,772 --> 00:51:20,275
     What? A three-legged       
     dog in a hospital?         

842
00:51:20,376 --> 00:51:23,278
 Yep, he said once the animal   
 touched him, he was healed.    

843
00:51:23,379 --> 00:51:24,979
         And was he?            

844
00:51:25,081 --> 00:51:28,149
 You'd know better than I, but  
     his physician says         
     that his arteries are      

845
00:51:28,250 --> 00:51:30,885
     Suddenly clear and his     
    arrhythmia is stabilized.   

846
00:51:30,986 --> 00:51:32,887
     That's impossible.         

847
00:51:32,988 --> 00:51:35,657
        I know. Have fun.       

848
00:51:35,758 --> 00:51:39,528
     A three-legged dog?        

849
00:51:48,571 --> 00:51:50,605
             Whoa.              

850
00:51:50,707 --> 00:51:55,009
     Hey, hey, hey, wait,       
         wait, wait!            
    Where you going so fast?    

851
00:51:55,111 --> 00:51:57,146
 Oh, I'm gonna go meet some     
     friends at the park.       

852
00:51:57,247 --> 00:52:00,214
     Oh, you got some new       
     friends. That's nice.      

853
00:52:00,316 --> 00:52:01,683
         Bring 'em over.        

854
00:52:01,784 --> 00:52:02,684
             Sure.              

855
00:52:02,785 --> 00:52:04,953
 Uh, when will dad be home?     

856
00:52:05,054 --> 00:52:08,857
    Soon. He's checking out a   
    prowler at the hospital.    

857
00:52:08,958 --> 00:52:10,392
            Burglar?            

858
00:52:10,493 --> 00:52:11,527
             Hmm.               

859
00:52:11,627 --> 00:52:14,563
     A three-legged one,        
     according to witnesses.    

860
00:52:14,664 --> 00:52:17,166
         Three legs?            

861
00:52:17,267 --> 00:52:19,234
             Mm-hm.             

862
00:52:19,335 --> 00:52:20,234
     What did he steal?         

863
00:52:20,336 --> 00:52:23,638
 Well, some hearts, apparently. 

864
00:52:23,739 --> 00:52:29,545
 You see, last night, a dog or  
 something went into some of    

865
00:52:29,645 --> 00:52:30,379
     The patients' rooms.       

866
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:33,482
         What happened?         

867
00:52:33,583 --> 00:52:35,450
        Well, nothing bad       
     from what I can gather.    

868
00:52:35,552 --> 00:52:39,488
     The patients seemed        
     to improve because         

869
00:52:39,589 --> 00:52:41,623
 Of this mysterious visitor.    

870
00:52:41,724 --> 00:52:43,625
        They got better.        

871
00:52:43,726 --> 00:52:44,959
             Yes.               

872
00:52:45,060 --> 00:52:48,229
        You know, I asked       
     the custodian about        

873
00:52:48,330 --> 00:52:52,033
     It because, um, having     
        an animal in the        

874
00:52:52,134 --> 00:52:55,036
 Hospital would be a serious    
 infringement of the rules,     

875
00:52:55,137 --> 00:52:57,339
     And could get a person     
     into a lot of trouble.     

876
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:00,975
         But he didn't          
     know anything about it.    

877
00:53:01,076 --> 00:53:05,180
     Didn't they catch her?     

878
00:53:05,281 --> 00:53:06,314
             Hm?                

879
00:53:06,416 --> 00:53:07,449
         Uh the animal?         

880
00:53:07,550 --> 00:53:08,784
            Did they?           

881
00:53:08,884 --> 00:53:11,820
Oh, no, no. She just vanished. A
 wondrous visit from a UFO.     

882
00:53:11,921 --> 00:53:14,255
             UFO?               

883
00:53:14,356 --> 00:53:15,257
             Mm.                

884
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:17,359
 Unidentified furry object.     

885
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:20,261
            Charley.            

886
00:53:20,362 --> 00:53:22,063
             Yes?               

887
00:53:22,164 --> 00:53:23,698
    Don't be late for dinner.   

888
00:53:23,799 --> 00:53:25,967
            I won't.            

889
00:54:05,975 --> 00:54:09,944
        Oh! Good heavens!       
     What are you doing on      

890
00:54:10,046 --> 00:54:11,079
     My property, young man?    

891
00:54:11,180 --> 00:54:13,181
 Um, I was taking a shortcut.   

892
00:54:13,283 --> 00:54:16,017
         Do I know you?         

893
00:54:16,118 --> 00:54:17,986
    You were at the hospital.   

894
00:54:18,087 --> 00:54:19,754
             Was.               

895
00:54:19,855 --> 00:54:21,390
            How come?           

896
00:54:21,491 --> 00:54:23,392
             Cancer.            

897
00:54:23,493 --> 00:54:25,294
             Sorry.             

898
00:54:25,395 --> 00:54:26,628
        Makes two of us.        

899
00:54:26,729 --> 00:54:28,530
 My dog, Annie, had cancer.     

900
00:54:28,631 --> 00:54:30,799
        Doc Elliot had to       
        cut her leg off.        

901
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:33,001
        I wish that would       
         work for me.           

902
00:54:33,102 --> 00:54:36,404
         Well, maybe my         
         dog could help.        

903
00:54:36,506 --> 00:54:39,140
     How on earth could         
        your dog help me?       

904
00:54:39,241 --> 00:54:40,775
     She's a Miracle dog.       

905
00:54:40,877 --> 00:54:45,947
    It would take a Miracle,    
     if I believed in them.     

906
00:54:46,048 --> 00:54:51,386
 Run along now. I've wasted     
     enough time on you.        

907
00:54:51,487 --> 00:54:53,087
     Are you going back?        

908
00:54:53,188 --> 00:54:55,457
        What business is        
         that of yours?         

909
00:54:55,558 --> 00:54:56,791
            It isn't.           

910
00:54:56,893 --> 00:54:58,927
            Are you?            

911
00:54:59,028 --> 00:55:02,097
         I-I don't want         
     to, but I have to.         

912
00:55:02,197 --> 00:55:03,932
             When?              

913
00:55:04,033 --> 00:55:05,066
         This afternoon.        

914
00:55:05,167 --> 00:55:07,068
     I'll come visit you.       

915
00:55:07,169 --> 00:55:09,638
        You want to come        
         and visit me?          

916
00:55:09,739 --> 00:55:11,506
        Sure, my mom and        
         dad work there.        

917
00:55:11,607 --> 00:55:13,274
         I'm charley.           

918
00:55:13,376 --> 00:55:16,945
     Charley. Katherine.        

919
00:55:17,046 --> 00:55:19,080
        I'll bring Annie.       

920
00:55:19,181 --> 00:55:21,416
     Oh, now, that'd be         
     quite a trick. I'd         

921
00:55:21,517 --> 00:55:23,184
         Like to see you        
     sneak her in there.        

922
00:55:23,285 --> 00:55:25,620
             Bye.               

923
00:55:27,289 --> 00:55:28,857
                Little hooligan.

924
00:55:28,958 --> 00:55:31,860
 Yes. How dare he               
try to be friendly?             

925
00:55:31,961 --> 00:55:36,297
             Edward, if you have
             a point to make, I 

926
00:55:36,398 --> 00:55:37,966
         Wish you would do so.  

927
00:55:38,067 --> 00:55:39,300
 No, no, no, not                
at all, Mrs. Mannion.           

928
00:55:39,402 --> 00:55:41,035
 You make all the               
points around here.             

929
00:55:41,136 --> 00:55:44,172
     Will you be                
staying outside long?           

930
00:55:44,273 --> 00:55:47,976
         I don't know. Perhaps. 

931
00:55:48,077 --> 00:55:52,814
 Yes, of course. Ring           
if you need assistance.         

932
00:55:52,915 --> 00:55:56,551
             I need assistance. 

933
00:55:56,652 --> 00:56:02,857
 No, Mrs. Mannion. You          
never need assistance.          

934
00:56:02,959 --> 00:56:05,360
 You are forced to accept it    
on occasion, but that's all.    

935
00:56:05,461 --> 00:56:08,462
                         Edward?

936
00:56:08,564 --> 00:56:16,638
     Um, could you stay awhile? 
        Perhaps we could talk?  

937
00:56:16,739 --> 00:56:18,573
Of course.                      

938
00:56:18,674 --> 00:56:22,010
                 But only uh,   
                if you want too.

939
00:56:22,111 --> 00:56:23,612
                 I mean, it is  
                 not an order.  

940
00:56:23,713 --> 00:56:25,814
I know, Mrs.-

00:56:25,915 --> 00:56:28,583
                     Katherine.

945
00:57:06,789 --> 00:57:10,324

    people better? 'cause if    

946
00:57:10,425 --> 00:57:12,260
     You can, then your         
        puppies can, too.

         Where am I?            

951
00:58:38,180 --> 00:58:39,748
     You're in a hospital.

     histories I have from      
     these dog stories?         

954
00:59:28,397 --> 00:59:29,965
         It's the talk          
        of the hospital.        

955
00:59:30,065 --> 00:59:31,299
         Yeah, but these        
        were all puppies.       

956
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:32,633
     We have puppies now?       

957
00:59:32,734 --> 00:59:35,904
        Well, look, I've        
     talked to security,        

958
00:59:36,005 --> 00:59:38,739
     The custodial staff        
     and the night nurses,      

959
00:59:38,841 --> 00:59:41,375
     And nobody has seen        
 anything. Just nothing. Zip.   

960
00:59:41,476 --> 00:59:42,610
         You know what's        
         really amazing?

        Each one of these       
     people is actually         

963
00:59:44,847 --> 00:59:46,580
        Healing at a much       
         faster rate.           

964
00:59:46,681 --> 00:59:48,950
    I know it's unbelievable,   
     but it's verifiable.       

965
00:59:49,051 --> 00:59:50,251
         I'm writing a          
         report on it.          

966
00:59:50,352 --> 00:59:51,419
     When's the conference?     

967
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:53,354
     Tomorrow, and I've         
    got the proof right here.   

968
00:59:53,455 --> 00:59:56,590
     I just don't know how      
    the board or Dr. Ecklin's   
         gonna take it.         

969
00:59:56,691 --> 00:59:58,126
     Sweetheart, you're         
     gonna hit a home run.      

970
00:59:58,227 --> 01:00:01,896
     Honey, I couldn't hit      
 sand if I fell off a camel.    

971
01:00:05,467 --> 01:00:07,869
     This is remarkable.

01:00:07,970 --> 01:00:11,272
 That's a good thing, right?    

973
01:00:11,373 --> 01:00:14,575
     Yeah. You know, a short    
        time ago I would        
     have said that uh,         

974
01:00:14,676 --> 01:00:18,046
 There was no Chance of you     
setting a foot on a tennis court
 for the rest of your life.     

975
01:00:18,147 --> 01:00:19,681
         But, uh, being         
        an ardent man of

01:00:19,782 --> 01:00:22,851

     say this is nothing        
     short of a Miracle.

01:00:41,804 --> 01:00:43,037
 And I expect a full report.    

987
01:00:43,138 --> 01:00:44,873
 Right. Th- thank you, sir.     

988
01:00:48,878 --> 01:00:52,346
     Charley, uh, has, like,    

989
01:00:52,448 --> 01:00:54,748
         A surprise he          
        wants to show me,       

990
01:00:54,850 --> 01:00:57,351
     And I was wondering        
         if maybe you'd         
         like to come.          

991
01:00:57,452 --> 01:01:00,354
         Anything to get        
        out of this bed.        

992
01:01:00,456 --> 01:01:02,123
             Okay.              

993
01:01:08,130 --> 01:01:11,199
     Well, these are the        
     puppies I was telling      
         you guys about.        

994
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:14,135
        I love puppies! I       
     saw his big brother.       

995
01:01:14,236 --> 01:01:18,439
         Oh, uh, mother.        
        This is Jennifer.       

996
01:01:18,540 --> 01:01:21,542
         You want her?          

997
01:01:21,643 --> 01:01:23,377
     What, you mean it?         

998
01:01:23,478 --> 01:01:24,312
             Yeah.              

999
01:01:24,413 --> 01:01:27,148
         Well, I-I can't        
     take her now, but...       

1000
01:01:27,249 --> 01:01:30,251
         Okay, but you          
     can't wait too long.       

1001
01:01:30,352 --> 01:01:33,822
     Everybody is talking       
    about these Miracle dogs.   

1002
01:01:33,923 --> 01:01:36,157
 Okay, wh-what are their names? 

1003
01:01:36,258 --> 01:01:38,226
         Well you guys          
     just met um, Jennifer.     

1004
01:01:38,327 --> 01:01:41,229
     And next to her is a       
     boy. His name is Lopez.    

1005
01:01:41,330 --> 01:01:44,165
        And over here is        
     Elton and there's John.    

1006
01:01:44,266 --> 01:01:47,702
 And there's Max and Annie.     

1007
01:01:47,803 --> 01:01:50,371
     Where did you get them?    

1008
01:01:50,472 --> 01:01:51,605
         They're hers.          

1009
01:01:51,707 --> 01:01:53,742
     I found them the second    
     day we came to town.       

1010
01:01:53,843 --> 01:01:57,578
        You know, you are       
     right about one thing.     

1011
01:01:57,679 --> 01:01:59,680
             What?              

1012
01:01:59,782 --> 01:02:02,316
         You have to get        
        them outta here.        

1013
01:02:08,657 --> 01:02:10,724
         Are we ready?          

1014
01:02:10,825 --> 01:02:12,026
         Rock and roll.         

1015
01:02:12,128 --> 01:02:13,795
             Great.             

1016
01:02:15,798 --> 01:02:18,366
     Uh, welcome, doctors.      

1017
01:02:18,467 --> 01:02:20,868
 If you'd care to take your     
     seats we can begin.        

1018
01:02:23,839 --> 01:02:27,842
     Um, by the way, we're      
     doing a live statewide     
         hookup today.          

1019
01:02:38,420 --> 01:02:41,655
 Okay, in suite one, a heart    
     pacemaker implant is in    

1020
01:02:41,757 --> 01:02:45,693
 Progress, and, over here...    

1021
01:02:45,795 --> 01:02:47,528
        ...A patient who        
     just had the procedure     

1022
01:02:47,629 --> 01:02:49,397
         Two days ago           
     is being monitored.        

1023
01:02:49,498 --> 01:02:54,768
 Um, if any of you would care to
 communicate with any of the    
     physicians or patients,    

1024
01:02:54,869 --> 01:02:57,005
 Feel free to do so with the    
 microphones in front of you.   

1025
01:02:57,106 --> 01:03:00,975
     Now the implantation       
 of the device, as you know,    

1026
01:03:01,076 --> 01:03:04,245
     Is accomplished through    
     the aorta, with the        
    aid of a small camera...    

1027
01:03:04,346 --> 01:03:06,147
         I gotta make a         
    call. I'll be right back.   

1028
01:03:06,248 --> 01:03:10,618
...Chest cavity. Okay, now first
 a little historical data about 
 the pacemaker device itself.   

1029
01:03:10,719 --> 01:03:13,521
     We have chosen to use a    
         demand unit            

1030
01:03:13,622 --> 01:03:17,491
 Which will take control if the 
patient's heart beat falls below
     the pre-programmed...      

1031
01:03:17,592 --> 01:03:20,828
     Ho! Whoa, whoa, whoa!      

1032
01:03:20,929 --> 01:03:22,363
         Hey, hey, hey!         

1033
01:03:22,464 --> 01:03:23,597
             W-w-w--            

1034
01:03:23,698 --> 01:04:32,233
             [  %%  ]              

1035
01:04:32,334 --> 01:04:33,234
             Hey!               

1036
01:04:33,335 --> 01:04:34,235
         Round 'em up!          

1037
01:04:34,336 --> 01:04:35,236
         I got 'em!             

1038
01:04:35,337 --> 01:04:36,237
         I got 'em!             

1039
01:04:36,338 --> 01:04:37,906
         Here we go. How        
         many we got?           

1040
01:04:38,007 --> 01:04:38,906
         Oh, uh. Hold           
         on, hold on.           

1041
01:04:39,007 --> 01:04:39,908
        One go in there?        

1042
01:04:40,009 --> 01:04:40,908
    There's one right there.    

1043
01:04:41,009 --> 01:04:42,677
     One went in there.         

1044
01:04:45,046 --> 01:05:10,671
             [  %%  ]              

1045
01:05:10,772 --> 01:05:12,873
     Oh, oh, oh. Good dog.      
         Wait, wait.            

1046
01:05:12,974 --> 01:05:13,975
     Ooh, ooh. All right.       
     Hold on! Here we go!       

1047
01:05:14,076 --> 01:05:15,910
     I got one! Okay, no,       
     no, no. C'mere, c'mere.    

1048
01:05:17,246 --> 01:05:20,248
     Hey, hey, hey! Here's      
     another over there.        

1049
01:05:23,519 --> 01:05:25,085
        There's one down        
     here, too. Look out.       

1050
01:05:25,187 --> 01:05:26,087
     Get this one over here!    

1051
01:05:26,188 --> 01:05:27,221
 I got them. I got them. Okay.  

1052
01:05:27,322 --> 01:05:29,890
 Wait, wait! One, two, three!   

1053
01:05:29,992 --> 01:05:31,659
     Where's the other?         

1054
01:05:33,662 --> 01:05:34,962
     The implantation of        
         the device,            

1055
01:05:35,063 --> 01:05:37,331
 As you know is accomplished    
        through the aorta       

1056
01:05:37,432 --> 01:05:38,899
         With the aid           
     of a small camera....      

1057
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,235
 ...Inserted simultaneously     
    through the chest cavity.   

1058
01:05:41,336 --> 01:05:43,103
     The pacemaker leads        
        are then threaded       

1059
01:05:43,205 --> 01:05:45,206
 Through the veins which lead   
     back to the heart.         

1060
01:05:45,307 --> 01:05:47,875
 These leads employ another     
 breakthrough in technology.    

1061
01:05:47,977 --> 01:05:52,213
 Now, as you can see, the uh,   
     implantation is very...    

1062
01:05:52,314 --> 01:05:53,614
     ...Smooth and quick.       

1063
01:05:53,715 --> 01:05:56,517
    Now here you can see the    
         dramatic change        

1064
01:05:56,618 --> 01:05:59,820
 That's been documented in this 
    patient in just two days.   

1065
01:05:59,921 --> 01:06:03,291
 As you'll note, the patient, a 
     man in his uh, late...     

1066
01:06:03,392 --> 01:06:06,927
 ...Sixties, has completely     
     transformed his um,        
     physical appearance.       

1067
01:06:07,929 --> 01:06:12,333
     Can there be a more        
     magnificent sight for      
     a surgeon than this?       

1068
01:06:15,870 --> 01:06:18,339
     As the venerable saying    
     goes, make sure...         

1069
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:19,940
        Jeez Louise! What       
     are you doing in here?     

1070
01:06:20,042 --> 01:06:25,145
 ...As you can see, this one    
     really tells the tale.     

1071
01:06:25,247 --> 01:06:28,783
         Thank you.             

1072
01:06:28,883 --> 01:06:36,857
         (clapping)             

1073
01:06:44,066 --> 01:06:45,233
        I'm sorry, ma'am.       

1074
01:06:45,334 --> 01:06:47,501
 Oh, don't be. She's wonderful. 

1075
01:06:47,603 --> 01:06:50,171
 But what is she doing here?    

1076
01:06:50,272 --> 01:06:52,673
         Uh, exercise.          

1077
01:06:52,774 --> 01:06:54,642
    You exercise dogs in the    
            hospital?           

1078
01:06:54,743 --> 01:06:57,411
     No...They exercise me.     

1079
01:06:57,512 --> 01:07:00,815
        Is this that dog        
        that little boy,        

1080
01:07:00,915 --> 01:07:02,116
     Charley, was telling       
            me about?           

1081
01:07:02,217 --> 01:07:05,118
     I sure hope not, ma'am.    

1082
01:07:05,220 --> 01:07:09,323
     Oh. Oh. Can she come       
     back and visit me?         

1083
01:07:09,424 --> 01:07:13,427
         I don't-I don't        
        think so, ma'am.        

1084
01:07:13,528 --> 01:07:16,497
         I'm sorry for          
        the disturbance.        

1085
01:07:16,598 --> 01:07:17,531
        Bye. Bye, Annie.        

1086
01:07:17,633 --> 01:07:22,470
     Good girl. Good girl.      
         There we go.           

1087
01:07:22,571 --> 01:07:24,839
             (sigh)             

1088
01:07:37,919 --> 01:07:39,487
     Hello? Animal control?     

1089
01:07:39,588 --> 01:07:42,423
Hi, this is Leeza Madison at the
        Cleveland clinic.       

1090
01:07:42,524 --> 01:07:45,726
         We have a-a-a          
         situation here,        

1091
01:07:45,827 --> 01:07:49,196
 And I need for you to send one 
of your officers over as soon as
            possible.           

1092
01:07:49,298 --> 01:07:53,301
     Yes, that would be         
        fine. Thank you.        

1093
01:07:56,971 --> 01:07:58,239
         What a day.            

1094
01:07:59,240 --> 01:08:02,610
 I'm so sorry, Mr. Aldrich,     
     but I have no choice.      

1095
01:08:02,711 --> 01:08:09,917
     You can pick up your       
     severance pay at the       
        cashier's office        

1096
01:08:10,018 --> 01:08:12,920
 When you deliver your keys and 
     your security card.        

1097
01:08:13,021 --> 01:08:18,426
     Why didn't you tell me     
 when I gave you the Chance?    

1098
01:08:18,527 --> 01:08:21,595
    It's a long story, ma'am.   

1099
01:08:21,697 --> 01:08:23,964
        I have the time.        

1100
01:08:24,065 --> 01:08:26,934
     But I don't, do I?         

1101
01:08:27,035 --> 01:08:29,002
             Ma'am.             

1102
01:08:36,178 --> 01:08:38,179
         Dr. Elliot.            

1103
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:38,846
            Ooh, hey!           

1104
01:08:38,947 --> 01:08:40,080
    Didn't expect to see you.   

1105
01:08:40,182 --> 01:08:41,582
        Doc, did you get        
     my message about Annie?    

1106
01:08:41,683 --> 01:08:42,983
     Yeah, I did. Didn't        
         you get mine?          

1107
01:08:43,084 --> 01:08:43,684
             No.                

1108
01:08:43,785 --> 01:08:44,418
             Oh.                

1109
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:46,254
             What?              

1110
01:08:46,355 --> 01:08:52,025
 She's gone. Uh, I had-I had a  
 visitor a few days ago, let a  
    bunch of my animals out.    

1111
01:08:52,127 --> 01:08:53,093
         Kidnapped?             

1112
01:08:53,194 --> 01:08:55,028
 Mm, more like a jailbreak.     

1113
01:08:55,129 --> 01:08:57,064
    Animal rights activists?    

1114
01:08:57,165 --> 01:08:58,999
        It's hard to say.       

1115
01:08:59,100 --> 01:09:01,335
 Charley's gonna be heartbroken.

1116
01:09:01,436 --> 01:09:03,471
         I'm sorry.             

1117
01:09:03,572 --> 01:09:09,710
    No, uh-ac-actually, it's    
     something else. Um, you    
     know a Tom Donaldson?      

1118
01:09:09,811 --> 01:09:11,244
        Yeah, sure, he's        
     a good friend of mine.     

1119
01:09:11,346 --> 01:09:12,947
     Well, then you knew        
     he had a heart bypass.     

1120
01:09:13,047 --> 01:09:13,947
             Yeah.              

1121
01:09:14,048 --> 01:09:18,986
         Well he's made         
     a remarkable recovery.     

1122
01:09:19,087 --> 01:09:22,022
    That's not a surprise. He   
     is a tough old bird.       

1123
01:09:22,123 --> 01:09:26,394
Yeah, yeah, but he claims it was
because a mysterious animal paid
         him a visit.           

1124
01:09:26,495 --> 01:09:29,863
         Zoo medicine.          

1125
01:09:29,964 --> 01:09:31,432
             What?              

1126
01:09:31,533 --> 01:09:35,335
     That's what they call      
     it sometimes when-when     
     animals are used, uh,      

1127
01:09:35,437 --> 01:09:36,537
     For recovery therapy       

1128
01:09:36,638 --> 01:09:39,740
 Yeah, it's-it's uh, it's kinda 
     like a placebo effect.     

1129
01:09:39,841 --> 01:09:42,376
     You know, the patient      
     thinks it's the animal,    
     but really, it's them.     

1130
01:09:42,477 --> 01:09:44,612
 Mm, like a positive attitude.  
     This really works?         

1131
01:09:44,713 --> 01:09:45,713
     ...You'd be surprised.     

1132
01:09:45,814 --> 01:09:47,581
     I already am. What do      
     you know about it?         

1133
01:09:47,682 --> 01:09:50,117
     Well, a lot. Here, come    
     on in the office. I'll     
     show you some stuff.       

1134
01:10:07,936 --> 01:10:09,503
     What are you doing?        

1135
01:10:09,604 --> 01:10:10,704
            Hey, kid.           

1136
01:10:10,805 --> 01:10:13,808
     Funny thing. I had         
 another one of my migraines.   

1137
01:10:13,908 --> 01:10:15,643
         I picked up the        
 puppies and now it's gone.     

1138
01:10:15,744 --> 01:10:16,710
     Maybe you were right.      

1139
01:10:16,811 --> 01:10:18,178
     What are you doing         
        with the puppies?       

1140
01:10:18,280 --> 01:10:20,648
         My job animal          
     control, remember?         

1141
01:10:20,749 --> 01:10:24,585
     You can't take them.       

1142
01:10:24,686 --> 01:10:26,754
 I got no choice in the matter. 

1143
01:10:30,292 --> 01:10:31,959
     What's gonna happen?       

1144
01:10:35,163 --> 01:10:36,997
         I'm sorry.             

1145
01:10:38,767 --> 01:10:40,768
         I'm sorry.             

1146
01:10:49,277 --> 01:10:50,678
 I done what I could, charley.  

1147
01:10:50,779 --> 01:10:53,647
         What happened?         

1148
01:10:53,748 --> 01:10:56,517
    Well I told you, we just    
 couldn't keep 'em that long.   

1149
01:10:56,618 --> 01:10:58,319
 Did someone say something?     

1150
01:10:58,420 --> 01:10:59,820
             No.                

1151
01:10:59,921 --> 01:11:03,223
They just ... Ran out. They were
waitin' for me when I opened the
             door               

1152
01:11:03,324 --> 01:11:05,225
             And...             

1153
01:11:05,326 --> 01:11:09,530
     Where you going, C.W.?     

1154
01:11:09,631 --> 01:11:13,634
     Oh, it's about time        
     I got me another job.      

1155
01:11:13,735 --> 01:11:16,003
 This one's wearin' me out.     

1156
01:11:16,104 --> 01:11:17,505
         They fired you?        

1157
01:11:17,606 --> 01:11:19,507
             Yeah.              

1158
01:11:19,608 --> 01:11:22,910
 It's okay. It's no big deal.   

1159
01:11:23,011 --> 01:11:26,614
        You take care of        
     yourself now, you hear?    

1160
01:12:12,661 --> 01:12:14,895
             Hi.                

1161
01:12:14,996 --> 01:12:16,196
        How was your day?       

1162
01:12:17,198 --> 01:12:19,099
        You have to give        
        him his job back.       

1163
01:12:22,771 --> 01:12:24,004
             Who?               

1164
01:12:24,105 --> 01:12:26,073
             C.W.               

1165
01:12:26,174 --> 01:12:28,676
             Why?               

1166
01:12:28,777 --> 01:12:32,413
     Because he wasn't the      
     one who had the puppies    
        in the basement.        

1167
01:12:33,414 --> 01:12:36,249
             I did.             

1168
01:12:36,351 --> 01:12:38,986
            You did?            

1169
01:12:39,087 --> 01:12:41,956
        All by yourself?        

1170
01:12:42,056 --> 01:12:45,525
     Why did you do that?       

1171
01:12:45,627 --> 01:12:47,928
     Because they would         
         have put the           
        puppies to sleep!       

1172
01:12:48,029 --> 01:12:49,496
         I had to save          
        Annie's puppies!        

1173
01:12:52,166 --> 01:12:53,366
     I was gonna try to         
     give them all homes...     

1174
01:12:53,467 --> 01:12:56,103
     ...But now they're         
         all gonna die.         

1175
01:12:56,204 --> 01:12:58,872
 Annie, Max and the puppies.    

1176
01:13:10,552 --> 01:13:12,019
             Well?              

1177
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:16,824
    How would you feel about    
     moving back to Denver?     

1178
01:13:16,925 --> 01:13:19,359
        They didn't fire        
         you, did they?         

1179
01:13:19,460 --> 01:13:21,695
         Uh ... Well...         

1180
01:13:21,796 --> 01:13:23,864
         All right,             
     that does it. I quit.      

1181
01:13:23,965 --> 01:13:25,332
 The-the Grant, everything.     

1182
01:13:25,433 --> 01:13:27,768
     Well, you don't have to    
     worry about the Grant.     

1183
01:13:27,869 --> 01:13:33,406
     There is no Grant. They    
         took it away.          

1184
01:13:33,507 --> 01:13:35,676
        They didn't even        
         talk to me!            

1185
01:13:35,777 --> 01:13:37,277
         Well, it wasn't        
         the clinic.            

1186
01:13:37,378 --> 01:13:40,080
     The clinic wanted us to    
     stay, and the board        
    really wanted us to stay.   

1187
01:13:40,181 --> 01:13:42,082
            They did?           

1188
01:13:42,183 --> 01:13:46,487
    Yes, they did! It was Dr.   
 Ecklin. He refused to give Mr. 
     Aldrich back his job.      

1189
01:13:46,588 --> 01:13:52,159
         So ... I quit.         

1190
01:13:52,260 --> 01:13:55,229
 I had to. It was a matter of   
    principle. I'm so sorry.    

1191
01:13:55,329 --> 01:13:59,266
 Nah, it's okay. Look ... I'm   
     still a pediatrician.      

1192
01:13:59,367 --> 01:14:01,134
         I know we were         
     counting on the Grant,     

1193
01:14:01,236 --> 01:14:02,870
    But I can still practice.   

1194
01:14:02,971 --> 01:14:05,873
 No it's a-it's a black Mark    
 on your record and I'm sorry.  

1195
01:14:05,974 --> 01:14:07,040
             Aah!               

1196
01:14:07,141 --> 01:14:09,376
     Black, blue, it doesn't    
    matter what color it is.    

1197
01:14:09,477 --> 01:14:12,079
         We're together.        

1198
01:14:12,180 --> 01:14:14,448
         I never liked          
     you working, anyway.       

1199
01:14:14,549 --> 01:14:17,517
     I love you, doctor.        

1200
01:14:17,618 --> 01:14:19,586
         Umm, good.             

1201
01:14:19,688 --> 01:14:23,590
     What are you doing?        
     You can't do that!         

1202
01:14:23,692 --> 01:14:25,292
         You can't throw        
     your research away!        

1203
01:14:25,393 --> 01:14:26,159
         Sure, I can.           

1204
01:14:26,260 --> 01:14:27,494
         No, you can't!         
         You'll need it!        

1205
01:14:27,595 --> 01:14:29,763
     No, I won't. I got you.    

1206
01:14:29,864 --> 01:14:32,299
             Oh!                

1207
01:14:35,303 --> 01:14:36,504
             Hey.               

1208
01:14:37,772 --> 01:14:39,006
    Have you seen Dr. Logan?    

1209
01:14:39,107 --> 01:14:41,508
         He's gone.             

1210
01:14:41,609 --> 01:14:44,311
     Oh, I just wanted to       
    tell him something. I'll    
     give him a call later.     

1211
01:14:44,412 --> 01:14:47,347
 You can't. Dr. Logan and his   
 wife were let go this morning. 

1212
01:14:47,448 --> 01:14:48,749
             What?              

1213
01:14:48,850 --> 01:14:50,751
     It's true. Andy, he's-     

1214
01:14:50,852 --> 01:14:54,588
    He's already gone. Andy?    

1215
01:15:01,595 --> 01:15:03,396
 Here, sweetie, I'll take it.   

1216
01:15:03,497 --> 01:15:07,901
    Charley ... I'm so sorry.   

1217
01:15:08,002 --> 01:15:10,504
     I tried to call the        
 county, but it was too late.   

1218
01:15:15,376 --> 01:15:17,745
 I'll get him a dog when we     
     get back to Denver.        

1219
01:15:17,846 --> 01:15:20,514
     Somehow, I don't think     
     it'll be the same.         

1220
01:15:20,615 --> 01:15:22,616
     (cell phone rings)         

1221
01:15:24,753 --> 01:15:26,854
             Hello.             

1222
01:15:26,955 --> 01:15:31,859
     No. We were just--         
         now? Okay.             

1223
01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:33,593
         Who was that?          

1224
01:15:33,694 --> 01:15:35,595
    It was Andy. He wants us    
    to come by the ballpark.    

1225
01:15:35,696 --> 01:15:36,897
             Why?               

1226
01:15:36,998 --> 01:15:38,265
    To say good-bye, I guess.   

1227
01:16:00,454 --> 01:16:03,123
     Good thing you called.     
     We were just on our        
         way outta here.        

1228
01:16:03,224 --> 01:16:04,524
         I just wanted          
        to say good-bye.        

1229
01:16:04,626 --> 01:16:05,993
     And to you, Mrs. Logan.    

1230
01:16:06,094 --> 01:16:07,928
        Take care, Andy.        

1231
01:16:08,029 --> 01:16:10,530
     Good luck, Dr. Malone.     

1232
01:16:10,632 --> 01:16:12,065
         You're going to        
         make a fine GP.        

1233
01:16:12,167 --> 01:16:13,066
         You think?             

1234
01:16:13,167 --> 01:16:14,568
             Yeah.              

1235
01:16:14,669 --> 01:16:17,304
 There's actually someone else  
 who wanted to say good-bye.    

1236
01:16:21,309 --> 01:16:26,379
     Hi. I just wanted to       
    say thank you to charley.   

1237
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:30,751
        Come on and give        
     me a hug, charley.         

1238
01:16:30,852 --> 01:16:33,753
         Here. Come on.         

1239
01:16:33,855 --> 01:16:39,759
         You changed my         
         life, charley.         

1240
01:16:39,861 --> 01:16:40,894
         It wasn't me.          

1241
01:16:40,996 --> 01:16:42,129
         Sure it was.           

1242
01:16:42,230 --> 01:16:44,297
        No, it was Annie.       

1243
01:16:44,398 --> 01:16:46,466
        And the puppies.        

1244
01:16:46,567 --> 01:16:50,470
     You're not going to        
     leave without thanking     
         her, are you?          

1245
01:16:50,571 --> 01:16:52,740
             What?              

1246
01:16:52,841 --> 01:16:55,708
        She deserves some       
         thanks, too.           

1247
01:17:15,729 --> 01:17:18,232
    Oh, you guys, come here!    

1248
01:17:19,901 --> 01:17:21,468
        (to Kelly) but I        
     thought they were-         

1249
01:17:21,569 --> 01:17:22,836
             No...              

1250
01:17:22,937 --> 01:17:24,171
     ...Dr. Elliot went and     
        got them himself.       

1251
01:17:24,272 --> 01:17:25,839
             He did?            

1252
01:17:25,940 --> 01:17:27,474
     After you told him         
     about the recoveries       

1253
01:17:27,575 --> 01:17:29,809
     And your research,         
         he went down           
     the very next day.         

1254
01:17:29,911 --> 01:17:34,147
     He kept one of the         
     puppies, charley. John.    

1255
01:17:34,249 --> 01:17:36,149
             Great!             

1256
01:17:36,251 --> 01:17:39,386
     Uh, I never showed         
        him my research.        

1257
01:17:39,487 --> 01:17:41,421
             I know.            

1258
01:17:41,522 --> 01:17:44,157
        There's one more        
     stop you need to make.     

1259
01:17:50,164 --> 01:17:52,266
 Ah, come in, doctor Logan.     

1260
01:17:52,366 --> 01:17:56,636
    I believe this is yours.    

1261
01:17:56,738 --> 01:17:59,306
             Yes.               

1262
01:17:59,407 --> 01:18:03,376
 I showed it to Dr. Ecklin ...  
     And he agrees with me      

1263
01:18:03,478 --> 01:18:05,645
 That it's-it's remarkable...   

1264
01:18:05,746 --> 01:18:07,514
         .And should be         
 implemented in the clinic.     

1265
01:18:07,615 --> 01:18:09,649
            He does?            

1266
01:18:09,750 --> 01:18:12,652
        Mm-hm. Isn't that       
         right ... Nate?        

1267
01:18:12,754 --> 01:18:14,121
         Yes it is...           

1268
01:18:14,222 --> 01:18:15,822
     ...Aunt Katherine.         

1269
01:18:15,924 --> 01:18:17,724
             Um...              

1270
01:18:17,825 --> 01:18:20,160
     ...I threw this away.      

1271
01:18:20,261 --> 01:18:24,798
     Oh, I know. Dr. Malone     
        retrieved it and        
        brought it to me.       

1272
01:18:24,899 --> 01:18:28,135
 You see, it's really quite     
     remarkable research.       

1273
01:18:28,236 --> 01:18:31,204
         Isn't it, Nate?        

1274
01:18:31,305 --> 01:18:36,009
 Dr. Logan, um, I was wrong.    

1275
01:18:36,110 --> 01:18:40,047
 The clinic would like to have  
 both you and your wife resume  
    your duties immediately.    

1276
01:18:40,148 --> 01:18:44,318
 Uh, that is, uh, if you'll     
     accept my apology.         

1277
01:18:44,418 --> 01:18:47,220
             And...             

1278
01:18:47,321 --> 01:18:51,224
     And I've reinstated Mr.    
        Aldrich, as well.       

1279
01:18:51,325 --> 01:18:54,928
 The truth is, the clinic never 
     wanted you to leave.       

1280
01:18:55,029 --> 01:18:57,197
        They informed me        
        of the decision,        

1281
01:18:57,298 --> 01:19:00,100
     Which it seems Nate        
     had made on his own,       

1282
01:19:00,201 --> 01:19:03,103
 And since...I'm the largest    
     donor to the clinic,       

1283
01:19:03,204 --> 01:19:05,805
        Without whom this       
     wing would not exist,      

1284
01:19:05,906 --> 01:19:10,510
 I persuaded Nate to reconsider.
         Didn't I, Nate?        

1285
01:19:10,611 --> 01:19:12,312
             Yes.               

1286
01:19:12,413 --> 01:19:15,615
 And what's more...He's also    
 instituting a zoo medicine     

1287
01:19:15,716 --> 01:19:17,917
     Facility right here        
         in this wing.          

1288
01:19:18,019 --> 01:19:19,886
     Isn't that wonderful?      

1289
01:19:19,988 --> 01:19:22,990
     It's uh, unbelievable,     
         is what it is.         

1290
01:19:23,091 --> 01:19:25,758
    Uh, if you'll excuse me?    

1291
01:19:29,597 --> 01:19:31,898
         Now..Where is          
     that son of yours?         

1292
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:35,802
 Um, he's outside in the hall,  
    waiting with his mother.    

1293
01:19:35,903 --> 01:19:38,171
 Well would you mind asking     
     him to step in here?       

1294
01:19:38,272 --> 01:19:42,943
 No, not at all. And ... Thank  
     you, Mrs. Mannion.         

1295
01:19:43,044 --> 01:19:46,646
 Uh-uh. Thank you, Dr. Logan.   

1296
01:19:48,850 --> 01:19:50,350
     Here comes your dad.       

1297
01:19:53,387 --> 01:19:55,288
        Uh, she wants to        
     talk to you, charley.      

1298
01:19:55,389 --> 01:19:56,623
             Me?                

1299
01:19:56,724 --> 01:19:57,957
         Our charley?           

1300
01:19:58,059 --> 01:19:59,959
     Yep. And guess what?       
 Mr. Aldrich got his job back.  

1301
01:20:00,061 --> 01:20:01,261
             He did?            

1302
01:20:01,362 --> 01:20:02,262
             Yeah.              

1303
01:20:02,363 --> 01:20:03,430
        Oh, that's great!       

1304
01:20:03,531 --> 01:20:05,232
         (to charley)           
        okay, go on, son.       
         Go talk to her.        

1305
01:20:05,333 --> 01:20:10,437
    Now ... What's goin' on?    

1306
01:20:10,538 --> 01:20:12,772
     It looks like we're        
        not going back to       
        Denver after all.       

1307
01:20:12,874 --> 01:20:13,773
         We're not?             

1308
01:20:13,874 --> 01:20:15,375
         No. We've been         
        reinstated, too.        

1309
01:20:15,476 --> 01:20:16,743
            We have?            

1310
01:20:16,845 --> 01:20:18,345
     Effective immediately.     

1311
01:20:18,446 --> 01:20:22,315
 Oh, well ... I don't know if   
    I want to be reinstated.    

1312
01:20:22,417 --> 01:20:24,117
             Why?               

1313
01:20:24,218 --> 01:20:25,185
             Well...            

1314
01:20:25,286 --> 01:20:26,954
     I was thinking about       
    what you said, about ...    

1315
01:20:27,055 --> 01:20:35,328
 Sometimes a mom should be at   
home, and I think maybe this mom
     should be at home now.     

1316
01:20:35,429 --> 01:20:39,566
 It would be the right time for 
 this mom to be at home, maybe. 

1317
01:20:39,667 --> 01:20:41,101
     You feeling all right?     

1318
01:20:41,202 --> 01:20:43,470
     Oh, yeah, never better,    
         but I'm hungry.        

1319
01:20:43,571 --> 01:20:46,273
         We just had            
     breakfast an hour ago.     

1320
01:20:46,374 --> 01:20:47,440
             I know.            

1321
01:20:47,541 --> 01:20:48,075
     And you're hungry.         

1322
01:20:48,176 --> 01:20:50,143
     Mm-hm, very hungry.        

1323
01:20:50,244 --> 01:20:52,846
    For something like...Um,    
         ice cream.             

1324
01:20:52,947 --> 01:20:54,381
         Ice cream?             

1325
01:20:54,482 --> 01:20:56,683
     Um, and...Pickles.         

1326
01:20:56,784 --> 01:20:59,952
     And pi ... Pickles.        

1327
01:21:00,054 --> 01:21:01,721
            Pickles.            

1328
01:21:03,691 --> 01:21:04,925
             Bingo!             

1329
01:21:07,595 --> 01:21:09,096
             Hi.                

1330
01:21:10,098 --> 01:21:14,401
Oh, charley. Listen, there's one
     thing I want from you.     

1331
01:21:14,502 --> 01:21:15,968
             What?              

1332
01:21:16,070 --> 01:21:19,406
 I want that puppy you brought  
     by to see me, Lopez.       

1333
01:21:19,507 --> 01:21:21,174
             Sure!              

1334
01:21:21,276 --> 01:21:23,043
     Charley, thank you!        

1335
01:21:23,144 --> 01:21:25,212
    Thank you for everything    

1336
01:21:25,313 --> 01:21:29,116
    It was the dogs. They're    
            special.            

1337
01:21:29,217 --> 01:21:31,551
    No, they're...Miraculous.   

1338
01:21:31,652 --> 01:21:36,055
        Thanks for giving       
     C.W. His job back.         

1339
01:21:36,157 --> 01:21:37,257
     Oh, don't mention it.      

1340
01:21:37,358 --> 01:21:39,259
         When can you           
        come home again?        

1341
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:41,295
         Next week. The         
     cancer's in remission.     

1342
01:21:41,395 --> 01:21:44,030
         Where's that?          

1343
01:21:44,132 --> 01:21:48,067
        Well, it's-it's a       
     very wonderful place.      

1344
01:21:48,169 --> 01:21:49,502
     Well...Then I'm glad.      

1345
01:21:49,603 --> 01:21:52,739
     Yeah, me, too. Will you    
        promise to bring        
     Annie by to see me?        

1346
01:21:52,840 --> 01:21:54,107
             I will.            

1347
01:21:54,208 --> 01:21:57,844
            Promise.            

1348

1351
01:22:13,161 --> 01:22:15,428
    It was so nice of charley   
     to give us Jennifer.       

1352
01:22:15,529 --> 01:22:17,264
        Yeah, but I think       
        our little friend       

1353
01:22:17,365 --> 01:22:19,966
     Charley gave us a lot      
    more than just Jennifer.    

1354
01:22:24,872 --> 01:22:27,107
    Well, ain't you the one?    

1355
01:22:27,208 --> 01:22:29,509
     I didn't expect to         
     see you around here.       

1356
01:22:29,610 --> 01:22:32,111
     Heard you got your         
     job back. I'm glad.

     saying anything about      
        me and the dogs.        

1361
01:22:41,155 --> 01:22:42,956

     the same for anybody.
