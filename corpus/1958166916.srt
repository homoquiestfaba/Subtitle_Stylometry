1
00:02:27,347 --> 00:02:30,582
- Hey, Barry, I'm kind of busy
right now.

2
00:02:30,584 --> 00:02:33,351
- What's your greatest
fear?

3
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:35,987
- I don't have time for your
jokes.

4
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,355
I'm running late as it is.

5
00:02:37,357 --> 00:02:38,824
- No, I'm serious.

6
00:02:38,826 --> 00:02:40,191
Your greatest fear.

7
00:02:40,193 --> 00:02:43,261
Think about it Nat, could be
a lot of money in this for us.

8
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:45,363
- For you, you mean.

9
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:47,566
- Listen, I just got off
the phone

10
00:02:47,568 --> 00:02:48,934
with a new client.

11
00:02:48,936 --> 00:02:52,239
He needs four stories in splash
pages by the end of today.

12
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,208
I told him you're just the
right girl for the job.

13
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:58,677
- Hold on, who is this guy?

14
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:00,111
- Who cares?

15
00:03:00,113 --> 00:03:01,780
He already put up half of cash.

16
00:03:01,782 --> 00:03:03,649
Four stories and four drawings,
Nat,

17
00:03:03,651 --> 00:03:05,817
all based on your greatest
fears.

18
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:08,687
You gotta deliver it all in
person by five o'clock today.

19
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:10,589
- That's not enough time.

20
00:03:10,591 --> 00:03:12,791
- Do you want the gig or
not?

21
00:03:12,793 --> 00:03:14,860
There's plenty of artists I
could call.

22
00:03:14,862 --> 00:03:15,961
- Okay.

23
00:03:15,963 --> 00:03:17,228
Okay, I'm in.

24
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:19,330
But on one condition,

25
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:21,567
I want my name on the cover as
creator.

26
00:03:21,569 --> 00:03:23,669
Full credit, not some pseudonym.

27
00:03:23,671 --> 00:03:25,671
- That wasn't part of
the deal.

28
00:03:25,673 --> 00:03:27,706
- It is if you want me.

29
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:29,009
And you know I'll deliver.

30
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:34,314
- All right, Nat, you got
yourself a deal.

31
00:03:35,282 --> 00:03:36,682
Better get busy.

32
00:03:36,684 --> 00:03:37,818
And make it scary.

33
00:05:11,712 --> 00:05:13,945
- I can't guys, no, this isn't
cool.

34
00:05:13,947 --> 00:05:14,880
We gotta go.

35
00:05:14,882 --> 00:05:15,947
Now that we're here, I just.

36
00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:17,549
- Dude, you're not gonna
back out on us again.

37
00:05:17,551 --> 00:05:19,350
You need to grow some balls.

38
00:05:19,352 --> 00:05:21,887
- We saved two months for this
man.

39
00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:23,388
You're doing it.

40
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:25,356
- Look, guys, I've heard horror
stories

41
00:05:25,358 --> 00:05:28,226
about guys dicks falling off
when they go to a whorehouse.

42
00:05:28,228 --> 00:05:29,628
This is crazy.

43
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:31,462
- I'm not taking no for an
answer on this.

44
00:05:31,464 --> 00:05:33,298
You already agreed to it.

45
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,667
- Yeah, but I didn't
think we'd actually do it.

46
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:36,735
- Dude, what do you think this
is,

47
00:05:36,737 --> 00:05:40,138
the average Joe's gems
of fucking whorehouses?

48
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:43,675
This is the Mercedes-Benz
of brothels, all right.

49
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:46,311
We're talking high quality stuff
here.

50
00:05:46,313 --> 00:05:49,214
- We're talking the Hope Diamond
of pussy.

51
00:05:49,216 --> 00:05:51,550
- And you two dorks know this
how?

52
00:05:51,552 --> 00:05:53,384
- We asked around bro.

53
00:05:53,386 --> 00:05:55,954
Look, let's just look around in
there.

54
00:05:55,956 --> 00:05:58,456
If it looks like a
penicillin oral to hell,

55
00:05:58,458 --> 00:05:59,459
we'll just leave.

56
00:06:44,572 --> 00:06:48,909
Lillian, I love what
you've done to the place.

57
00:06:52,045 --> 00:06:54,114
- Come on in, says a spider to
the flies.

58
00:07:02,956 --> 00:07:04,155
Jez will be right with you.

59
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:05,524
- Jez?

60
00:07:05,526 --> 00:07:06,825
- Jezebel.

61
00:07:06,827 --> 00:07:08,461
- That ain't cliche or anything.

62
00:07:13,834 --> 00:07:17,202
- I'll tell you one thing,
the girls here are gorgeous.

63
00:07:17,204 --> 00:07:18,303
They are, I'll give you that.

64
00:07:18,305 --> 00:07:20,371
But I don't feel right
about this, guys, I mean.

65
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:25,276
- Jason, you have got to stop
being so scared of pussy man.

66
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:27,112
Listen, trust me on this.

67
00:07:27,114 --> 00:07:30,616
You do not wanna lose it to
some girl at the bar, all right.

68
00:07:30,618 --> 00:07:33,652
The women here, they know
exactly what they're doing

69
00:07:33,654 --> 00:07:38,491
and they get checked
out regularly, probably.

70
00:07:39,359 --> 00:07:41,760
- These girls are incredible.

71
00:07:41,762 --> 00:07:44,530
They are clean, discreet and
professional.

72
00:07:44,532 --> 00:07:48,667
Plus, plus, they know what
they're doing.

73
00:07:48,669 --> 00:07:52,773
Ooh, they will blow the socks
off your motherfucking feet.

74
00:07:53,707 --> 00:07:54,873
- Really?

75
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:59,310
- I am proud to say I am a
regular here.

76
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:04,384
I've even got my own special
girl, Candy.

77
00:08:06,587 --> 00:08:07,653
- Nice.

78
00:08:07,655 --> 00:08:10,891
- Get the frequent flyer
discount and everything.

79
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:13,892
Bitch.

80
00:08:13,894 --> 00:08:14,693
- I'm outta here.

81
00:08:14,695 --> 00:08:18,465
- My, aren't we anxious?

82
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,366
- It's our boy Jason's birthday,

83
00:08:21,368 --> 00:08:24,169
and I think it's about time
for him to become a man.

84
00:08:25,506 --> 00:08:28,141
- Oh a virgin.

85
00:08:29,376 --> 00:08:31,643
We'll take really good care of
him.

86
00:08:31,645 --> 00:08:33,478
What about you two?

87
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,846
Shall I get three rooms ready?

88
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:39,284
- My fiance would shit a
brick, Godzilla size brick.

89
00:08:39,286 --> 00:08:42,120
And then she would tear
this motherfucker down

90
00:08:42,122 --> 00:08:44,355
and then light it on fire.

91
00:09:18,792 --> 00:09:20,728
- You're in good hands.

92
00:09:26,433 --> 00:09:28,435
Just relax and enjoy it.

93
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:32,838
They will.

94
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,939
- They?

95
00:09:44,117 --> 00:09:45,651
I'm Jason.

96
00:09:45,653 --> 00:09:46,785
Who are you?

97
00:09:46,787 --> 00:09:50,824
- I'm Tina and she is Madison.

98
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:53,491
- Nice to meet you.

99
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:01,767
- Have fun, darlings.

100
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:01,028
- Are you ready to join it,
lover?

101
00:11:04,565 --> 00:11:07,098
- Holy shit dude, I think that
was Jason.

102
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:10,604
- Sounds like somebody finally
got their cherry popped.

103
00:11:14,975 --> 00:11:16,675
- It's the wrong kinda fucked.

104
00:11:16,677 --> 00:11:18,309
- What was that?

105
00:11:18,311 --> 00:11:23,316
- Shh, we're going to take
very good care of you.

106
00:11:28,088 --> 00:11:28,556
- What the...

107
00:11:29,122 --> 00:11:30,323
- What are you doing?

108
00:11:33,727 --> 00:11:35,462
This is a bit much for me.

109
00:11:37,665 --> 00:11:39,332
- You talk too much, kid.

110
00:11:51,144 --> 00:11:52,613
- Help me.

111
00:11:53,747 --> 00:11:54,915
Help me, help.

112
00:11:57,785 --> 00:11:58,952
Help me, help.

113
00:12:01,822 --> 00:12:02,656
Help me.

114
00:12:05,659 --> 00:12:06,493
Help me.

115
00:12:08,128 --> 00:12:09,895
- Jason.
- Jason, you okay dude.

116
00:12:09,897 --> 00:12:11,062
- Jason.

117
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:26,545
- Help me.

118
00:12:26,547 --> 00:12:29,583
- I would love to help you, my
boy.

119
00:12:30,751 --> 00:12:34,788
But you see, you are helping me.

120
00:12:36,056 --> 00:12:40,291
Have you any idea how difficult
it is

121
00:12:40,293 --> 00:12:43,564
to find an actual virgin in this
town?

122
00:12:44,598 --> 00:12:45,797
- What the fuck.

123
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:49,937
- The name is Crowley, Aleister
Crowley.

124
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:54,272
Allow me to thank you in
advance.

125
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:59,246
Your sacrifice will bring
about a new world for us all.

126
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,280
A new creed.

127
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:05,485
The rebirth of the golden dawn.

128
00:13:16,864 --> 00:13:18,866
Yes, yes, give him head.

129
00:13:24,772 --> 00:13:28,273
Will you shut him up?

130
00:14:51,992 --> 00:14:53,894
- Oh my, what the fuck?

131
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,768
- Dude you said these
bitches were checked out.

132
00:16:51,478 --> 00:16:54,081
- Heart of the pure.

133
00:16:59,319 --> 00:17:02,122
And of the unpure.

134
00:17:06,026 --> 00:17:07,127
Let it begin.

135
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:10,529
- Dude, we need to get outta
here like right fucking now.

136
00:17:10,531 --> 00:17:13,031
- Man, Jason, man, he's
getting all fucked up in there.

137
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:14,668
- And so will we, now go.

138
00:17:24,444 --> 00:17:25,677
Dude, what about this guy?

139
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:28,980
- Oh man, I don't know, look
at him, he's all fucked up.

140
00:17:28,982 --> 00:17:30,651
- Holy shit, holy shit, holy
shit.

141
00:17:32,219 --> 00:17:34,085
Eric, do something, help me.

142
00:17:34,087 --> 00:17:35,353
- I don't know what to do.

143
00:17:35,355 --> 00:17:36,755
- Anything but that, hurry.

144
00:17:36,757 --> 00:17:39,090
Just grab anything.

145
00:17:39,092 --> 00:17:40,926
Just dude hand it, hand it, hand
it,

146
00:17:40,928 --> 00:17:43,094
give it, grab it, grab it.

147
00:17:55,275 --> 00:17:57,077
- Leaving us so soon.

148
00:18:00,113 --> 00:18:00,948
- Oh fuck.

149
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:11,625
- Behold, the culmination
of the third eon.

150
00:18:19,667 --> 00:18:22,701
The rebirth of Horus,

151
00:18:22,703 --> 00:18:26,339
bringing us divinity and the
final eon.

152
00:18:29,176 --> 00:18:31,545
Bow before the true beast.

153
00:19:13,053 --> 00:19:17,322
- Holy shit, that was
the most fucked up dream.

154
00:19:17,324 --> 00:19:19,092
- Glad you're awake, we're here.

155
00:19:28,335 --> 00:19:31,837
- Dude, what in the full on
fuck?

156
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:34,139
- Bastard's always gonna be a
virgin.

157
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:46,017
- Hi, Barry, it's Nat returning
your call.

158
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:48,520
Sorry, I had my phone turned
off.

159
00:19:48,522 --> 00:19:50,656
I got your message about the
first story.

160
00:19:50,658 --> 00:19:51,959
That's great news.

161
00:19:53,994 --> 00:19:56,061
I'm so glad you liked it.

162
00:19:56,063 --> 00:19:57,698
I'll send the next one over
soon.

163
00:19:59,533 --> 00:20:00,701
Within the hour?

164
00:20:02,402 --> 00:20:03,336
Oh, sure.

165
00:20:14,882 --> 00:20:16,214
- I found you.

166
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,321
I found you.

167
00:20:23,657 --> 00:20:26,326
Sorry, I scared you, you left
this.

168
00:20:27,628 --> 00:20:28,629
- Thank you.

169
00:20:29,429 --> 00:20:30,263
- No worries.

170
00:20:32,199 --> 00:20:33,200
Are you okay?

171
00:20:34,267 --> 00:20:36,570
- Just need a little rest,
that's all.

172
00:20:37,871 --> 00:20:40,271
- Well, I should get back to
work.

173
00:20:40,273 --> 00:20:41,540
Take care, Miss. Chase.

174
00:20:41,542 --> 00:20:43,410
I'll see you next Friday.

175
00:23:01,515 --> 00:23:03,181
- Hey, Hadda.

176
00:23:03,183 --> 00:23:04,351
- Hey Phyllis.

177
00:23:06,053 --> 00:23:07,853
- You got the stuff for me.

178
00:23:07,855 --> 00:23:09,420
- I do, you know I do.

179
00:23:09,422 --> 00:23:10,889
- The regular.

180
00:23:10,891 --> 00:23:12,891
- Maybe, might have

181
00:23:12,893 --> 00:23:14,826
a little surprise for you
though.

182
00:23:14,828 --> 00:23:16,094
- You're always the best,
Phyllis.

183
00:23:16,096 --> 00:23:17,929
- Yeah.
- Have the best stuff around.

184
00:23:17,931 --> 00:23:19,230
- Well, I brought something else

185
00:23:19,232 --> 00:23:22,734
that you might be
interested in, I don't know.

186
00:23:22,736 --> 00:23:25,036
What do you think about
trying some of this?

187
00:23:25,038 --> 00:23:25,706
Mmmm.

188
00:23:25,973 --> 00:23:27,107
Yeah.

189
00:23:27,474 --> 00:23:28,974
- You know, I'll always try
anything.

190
00:23:28,976 --> 00:23:30,642
- And I heard the best place to
put it

191
00:23:30,644 --> 00:23:32,744
is like right in the side
of your boob, you know,

192
00:23:32,746 --> 00:23:35,080
so it gets in your bloodstream
a little bit faster.

193
00:23:35,082 --> 00:23:36,214
So if that's something you wanna
try.

194
00:23:36,216 --> 00:23:39,585
Hey, that's a freebie on me.

195
00:23:39,587 --> 00:23:40,619
- Same time next week.

196
00:23:40,621 --> 00:23:42,754
- Yes, have fun shooting that
up.

197
00:23:42,756 --> 00:23:43,589
Let me know how it goes.

198
00:23:43,591 --> 00:23:45,724
I hope I see you again.

199
00:23:45,726 --> 00:23:47,559
- I will absolutely be back.

200
00:23:47,561 --> 00:23:48,794
- All right.

201
00:25:29,262 --> 00:25:30,664
- Help.

202
00:25:35,536 --> 00:25:36,369
Help.

203
00:25:40,173 --> 00:25:41,008
Help.

204
00:25:50,951 --> 00:25:52,317
Help.

205
00:26:56,283 --> 00:26:59,953
- Cleanliness is obviously
not next to godliness.

206
00:27:09,362 --> 00:27:10,497
What is this?

207
00:27:16,403 --> 00:27:18,739
- Jezebel, whore.

208
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:20,706
Why are you denying it?

209
00:27:20,708 --> 00:27:22,541
Just tell me the truth, Lucy.

210
00:27:22,543 --> 00:27:23,474
- Oh, sure.

211
00:27:23,476 --> 00:27:24,710
You're imagining things.

212
00:27:24,712 --> 00:27:26,244
You're just paranoid.

213
00:27:26,246 --> 00:27:27,613
I mean, what do you want me to
say.

214
00:27:27,615 --> 00:27:29,883
- All right, so how do you
explain theses?

215
00:27:30,884 --> 00:27:32,884
You know, I don't let you
wear this kind of stuff.

216
00:27:32,886 --> 00:27:35,887
This is the attire of a whore, a
Jezebel.

217
00:27:35,889 --> 00:27:37,723
- All right Marshall
you've got the evidence

218
00:27:37,725 --> 00:27:39,124
now choke on it.

219
00:27:39,126 --> 00:27:40,360
- Choke on it, yourself.

220
00:27:41,461 --> 00:27:44,429
Do you have any idea what
this is gonna do to my career,

221
00:27:44,431 --> 00:27:46,732
what it's gonna do to my
personal life?

222
00:27:46,734 --> 00:27:49,400
What are the people at church
gonna think of me now, Lucy?

223
00:27:49,402 --> 00:27:51,737
I'm gonna give you a joke
and it's all your fault.

224
00:27:51,739 --> 00:27:54,640
- Marshall, our marriage
has been deteriorating

225
00:27:54,642 --> 00:27:56,441
for a long time now.

226
00:27:56,443 --> 00:27:59,945
We've just, we've fallen away
from each other emotionally,

227
00:27:59,947 --> 00:28:01,412
it happens.

228
00:28:01,414 --> 00:28:04,783
Let's just learn to deal
with this like two adults.

229
00:28:04,785 --> 00:28:08,353
- Let's just deal with it,
yeah, let's just deal with it.

230
00:28:08,355 --> 00:28:09,955
I will not have this in my
house.

231
00:28:09,957 --> 00:28:11,557
You heathen bitch.

232
00:28:11,559 --> 00:28:11,959
Stop!

233
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:15,193
I can't allow you to destroy me
anymore.

234
00:28:17,765 --> 00:28:18,597
Bitch.

235
00:28:19,432 --> 00:28:21,567
Ruined my life.

236
00:28:21,569 --> 00:28:23,034
I hate you.

237
00:28:23,036 --> 00:28:24,936
You whore, Jezebel.

238
00:28:39,152 --> 00:28:40,988
- Hey, it's me.

239
00:28:43,423 --> 00:28:45,993
Marshall knows, he found out.

240
00:28:47,728 --> 00:28:50,564
I guess we left some evidence
in the backseat of the car.

241
00:28:53,567 --> 00:28:55,734
I know, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

242
00:28:55,736 --> 00:28:58,438
But I mean, we knew he was
gonna find out eventually.

243
00:29:01,074 --> 00:29:02,810
We weren't very careful anymore.

244
00:29:03,977 --> 00:29:05,511
We got too careless.

245
00:29:05,513 --> 00:29:08,179
And I'm just so scared.

246
00:29:09,783 --> 00:29:10,949
I'm so scared.

247
00:29:10,951 --> 00:29:13,621
He's just got that temper,
I've talked to you about.

248
00:29:16,456 --> 00:29:19,126
What if he tries
to kill me?

249
00:29:20,794 --> 00:29:25,465
I know, okay, okay.

250
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:28,301
Okay, I'm sorry.

251
00:29:31,705 --> 00:29:33,338
Okay.

252
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:34,174
You're right.

253
00:29:37,811 --> 00:29:38,546
You're right.

254
00:29:39,713 --> 00:29:40,548
Yeah.

255
00:29:41,682 --> 00:29:43,851
Yeah, I'm in, let's do this.

256
00:29:44,818 --> 00:29:46,484
- Whore.

257
00:29:46,486 --> 00:29:48,455
- I just can't wait until
it's over

258
00:29:49,222 --> 00:29:51,324
- Then we can be together
forever, baby.

259
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:53,994
Okay.

260
00:29:55,362 --> 00:29:56,664
All right, bye.

261
00:31:55,516 --> 00:31:57,585
- You've given me the kiss of
Judas, Lucy.

262
00:32:04,625 --> 00:32:07,427
"Wife, submit to your
husband that says the Lord."

263
00:32:09,763 --> 00:32:11,431
Nothing to say, huh?

264
00:32:13,801 --> 00:32:17,304
Okay hot pants, go ahead
and put these on for me.

265
00:32:18,171 --> 00:32:19,671
- What?

266
00:32:19,673 --> 00:32:20,508
No.

267
00:32:23,677 --> 00:32:25,644
- That's what I thought.

268
00:32:25,646 --> 00:32:27,815
You don't even wanna
love me anymore, do you?

269
00:32:29,617 --> 00:32:32,818
It's like you said, this
relationship really is over.

270
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:35,255
It's hopeless, I don't know
why I even bother.

271
00:32:38,792 --> 00:32:41,092
You wanna make a fool outta me?

272
00:32:41,094 --> 00:32:43,261
You look stupid in everything.

273
00:32:43,263 --> 00:32:45,163
You're an idiot.

274
00:32:45,165 --> 00:32:46,497
You brought this all on
yourself.

275
00:32:46,499 --> 00:32:49,234
You've got nobody else
to blame but yourself.

276
00:32:49,236 --> 00:32:50,969
Die bitch.

277
00:32:50,971 --> 00:32:55,976
"So sayeth the Lord, wife
submit to your husband."

278
00:33:42,155 --> 00:33:43,256
Oh, sorry, honey.

279
00:33:46,627 --> 00:33:49,096
Bitch, you can't say you
didn't deserve that one.

280
00:34:22,563 --> 00:34:24,062
Deacon Grantham.

281
00:34:24,064 --> 00:34:24,898
- Hey.

282
00:34:27,901 --> 00:34:32,070
I know it's a little later than
normal.

283
00:34:32,072 --> 00:34:35,807
I got off of my shift a little
late, so,

284
00:34:35,809 --> 00:34:39,144
but I brought those notes
for your sermon next week

285
00:34:39,146 --> 00:34:41,780
on marriage in the Lord's eyes.

286
00:34:41,782 --> 00:34:42,881
- It just totally slipped my
mind

287
00:34:42,883 --> 00:34:43,749
that you were coming tonight.

288
00:34:43,751 --> 00:34:46,451
I got so much going on tonight,

289
00:34:46,453 --> 00:34:48,219
I just totally forgot about it.

290
00:34:48,221 --> 00:34:49,387
It's fine, you can come on in.

291
00:34:49,389 --> 00:34:50,891
Come on in, make yourself home.

292
00:34:52,392 --> 00:34:53,291
Come let's go in here.

293
00:34:57,097 --> 00:34:58,229
Have a seat right here.

294
00:34:58,231 --> 00:34:59,166
Have a seat right here.

295
00:34:59,633 --> 00:35:01,569
- All right.

296
00:35:03,504 --> 00:35:07,138
- So I got some really
great ideas, you know,

297
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:09,877
of marriage and divorce
and all that stuff.

298
00:35:11,545 --> 00:35:13,344
Man, I'm a little parched.

299
00:35:13,346 --> 00:35:14,648
Mind if I go grab a beer?

300
00:35:16,316 --> 00:35:17,482
- No, wait a minute, come here,
come here,

301
00:35:17,484 --> 00:35:18,652
wait, wait, whoa, whoa.

302
00:35:21,955 --> 00:35:23,822
It's just I'm so scatter brain,

303
00:35:23,824 --> 00:35:26,024
I just remembered I grabbed the
last one.

304
00:35:26,026 --> 00:35:27,861
That's the last beer in there.

305
00:35:28,862 --> 00:35:32,197
There's no more beers,
I drank the last one.

306
00:35:32,199 --> 00:35:34,032
Here, you can have it if you
want it.

307
00:35:34,034 --> 00:35:35,867
- I wouldn't want to take your
last beer.

308
00:35:35,869 --> 00:35:37,536
- It's perfectly fine.

309
00:35:37,538 --> 00:35:38,870
To be honest, I'm feeling a
little queasy,

310
00:35:38,872 --> 00:35:39,838
I don't even even know why I
grabbed it.

311
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,439
I didn't even want it when I
opened it.

312
00:35:41,441 --> 00:35:42,275
It's all yours.

313
00:35:44,177 --> 00:35:46,714
- All right, well, that's
mighty cool of you.

314
00:35:51,318 --> 00:35:52,851
If you can't drink at for your
Pastor,

315
00:35:52,853 --> 00:35:54,319
who can you drink at?

316
00:35:54,321 --> 00:35:55,987
- Too true, yeah.

317
00:35:55,989 --> 00:35:58,356
- All right bud, all right.

318
00:35:58,358 --> 00:35:59,424
- Okay.

319
00:36:02,495 --> 00:36:04,097
- Are you sure you're okay?

320
00:36:12,873 --> 00:36:14,274
It's your phone in there?

321
00:36:15,375 --> 00:36:20,546
You think Lucy will pick it up?

322
00:36:20,548 --> 00:36:21,680
Why don't you wait right there,

323
00:36:21,682 --> 00:36:24,852
I'll go get it, it could be
important.

324
00:36:50,844 --> 00:36:52,379
Oh my God.

325
00:37:06,093 --> 00:37:07,225
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

326
00:37:07,227 --> 00:37:08,093
It's okay.

327
00:37:08,095 --> 00:37:10,261
You got me, you got me.

328
00:37:10,263 --> 00:37:12,798
You have to understand though,
she was cheating on me.

329
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,766
She would've ruined me.

330
00:37:14,768 --> 00:37:16,668
I didn't know what else to do.

331
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:18,670
The Bible, Deacon you know this,

332
00:37:18,672 --> 00:37:20,806
the Bible looks down
upon things like that.

333
00:37:20,808 --> 00:37:21,807
In the Old Testament's time,

334
00:37:21,809 --> 00:37:23,476
she would've been stoned to
death.

335
00:37:28,148 --> 00:37:29,750
- Relax, put your hands down.

336
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:36,454
- I lost it, I lost it, I
didn't know what else to do.

337
00:37:36,456 --> 00:37:39,991
I'm sorry, but I'm not
sorry, she deserved it.

338
00:37:48,335 --> 00:37:51,302
I'm sorry, I really am, but
I didn't have any other,

339
00:37:51,304 --> 00:37:52,472
I had no other option.

340
00:37:55,943 --> 00:37:59,813
- Pastor, do you know
how much I make a year?

341
00:38:01,782 --> 00:38:02,748
- How much?

342
00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:04,683
- Not a whole hell of a lot.

343
00:38:04,685 --> 00:38:07,686
After taxes and insurance

344
00:38:07,688 --> 00:38:10,321
and all that money my ex ran off
with,

345
00:38:10,323 --> 00:38:14,192
well it doesn't really amount to
anything.

346
00:38:14,194 --> 00:38:18,229
- I'm sorry to hear that, I
truly am.

347
00:38:18,231 --> 00:38:21,733
- Does old Lucy have a
life insurance policy?

348
00:38:21,735 --> 00:38:23,902
- You know, she does.

349
00:38:23,904 --> 00:38:25,971
Haven't thought about it until
you brought it up just now,

350
00:38:25,973 --> 00:38:26,805
but yeah.

351
00:38:26,807 --> 00:38:27,641
- How much?

352
00:38:30,043 --> 00:38:31,242
- A million dollars.

353
00:38:31,244 --> 00:38:34,748
- Say you split that million
with me.

354
00:38:36,049 --> 00:38:39,286
I help you dispose of the body

355
00:38:40,387 --> 00:38:43,221
and you don't get caught.

356
00:38:43,223 --> 00:38:44,558
We go our separate ways.

357
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:49,728
- I don't understand,
why would you do this?

358
00:38:49,730 --> 00:38:53,567
- Well, I got a lot of debts,
you know,

359
00:38:54,401 --> 00:38:58,303
I'm sunk in my house, my husband
ran off with all that money

360
00:38:58,305 --> 00:39:00,473
and I don't make shit.

361
00:39:01,308 --> 00:39:03,642
So I gotta do something.

362
00:39:03,644 --> 00:39:07,345
I'm not gonna get an
amazing raise anytime soon.

363
00:39:07,347 --> 00:39:08,181
We got a deal?

364
00:39:13,153 --> 00:39:14,686
- Yes.

365
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:16,487
You have a deal, my friend.

366
00:39:16,489 --> 00:39:17,355
- Excellent.

367
00:39:18,191 --> 00:39:19,791
- This is working out perfectly.

368
00:39:19,793 --> 00:39:20,859
I can't believe it.

369
00:39:20,861 --> 00:39:21,995
It's almost like it's.

370
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:23,864
- God's will?

371
00:39:24,765 --> 00:39:26,397
- Exactly.

372
00:39:26,399 --> 00:39:28,569
It's a miracle, a true miracle.

373
00:39:29,770 --> 00:39:31,336
- Yeah, sure is.

374
00:40:02,235 --> 00:40:04,603
I thought we'd just bring her
out here, set her on fire,

375
00:40:04,605 --> 00:40:06,905
let her burn until there's
nothing left but ashes.

376
00:40:06,907 --> 00:40:09,307
Nobody ever be able to
identify her that way.

377
00:40:09,309 --> 00:40:12,245
- I don't know, pretty dry
out here this time of year.

378
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:16,548
- You start a fire,
the whole woods is going up?

379
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:18,550
- Eh, I guess you got a
point.

380
00:40:18,552 --> 00:40:19,718
Don't wanna do that.

381
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,219
Last thing we need is Smokey
the bear after our asses

382
00:40:21,221 --> 00:40:22,590
on top of everything else.

383
00:40:24,224 --> 00:40:26,625
Tell you what though, my parents
stay,

384
00:40:26,627 --> 00:40:27,693
they've got land down here.

385
00:40:27,695 --> 00:40:30,562
There's an old well,
it goes down for miles.

386
00:40:30,564 --> 00:40:33,431
What do you say we take old
Lucy for swim down there.

387
00:40:33,433 --> 00:40:34,766
By the time everybody finds her,

388
00:40:34,768 --> 00:40:36,301
there won't be anything left.

389
00:40:36,303 --> 00:40:37,803
Nobody will ever know it's even
her.

390
00:40:37,805 --> 00:40:41,139
Just bones and little bit of
dust maybe.

391
00:40:42,576 --> 00:40:43,975
- As long as you get the
insurance pay out on it.

392
00:40:43,977 --> 00:40:45,946
That's all I really give a shit
about.

393
00:41:07,701 --> 00:41:08,900
- Dead weight.

394
00:41:08,902 --> 00:41:11,438
Why don't you make yourself
useful, give me a hand.

395
00:41:14,341 --> 00:41:15,208
Oh God.

396
00:41:16,877 --> 00:41:21,279
Lucy, maybe we should have
done the Jane Fonda aerobics,

397
00:41:21,281 --> 00:41:22,115
like you wanted.

398
00:41:23,717 --> 00:41:24,552
All right.

399
00:41:25,553 --> 00:41:26,386
God.

400
00:41:28,321 --> 00:41:29,156
Oh god.

401
00:41:43,771 --> 00:41:47,541
Jesus, maybe this wasn't
such a good idea after all.

402
00:41:49,777 --> 00:41:51,309
- Can you make it?

403
00:41:51,311 --> 00:41:52,878
- Sure.

404
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,880
- Christ, couldn't you get
somebody

405
00:41:54,882 --> 00:41:56,948
who knows what they're doing?

406
00:41:56,950 --> 00:41:58,619
- Hey, I know what I'm doing.

407
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:04,355
- You sure about that?

408
00:42:04,357 --> 00:42:05,859
- Oh Jesus Christ.

409
00:42:08,295 --> 00:42:09,930
- Why don't you take this?

410
00:42:10,931 --> 00:42:12,463
Why don't I grab the body?

411
00:42:12,465 --> 00:42:15,634
- Yeah, why don't we do that,
She-ra?

412
00:42:15,636 --> 00:42:18,537
Go on and pick her up there,
China.

413
00:42:18,539 --> 00:42:20,238
Show me how it's done.

414
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,209
Woman power and all that crap.

415
00:42:30,450 --> 00:42:32,853
What matter, She Hulk,
getting too heavy for you?

416
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:01,379
Well, here we are.

417
00:43:01,381 --> 00:43:06,419
I think we're far enough out
here.

418
00:43:06,787 --> 00:43:08,987
I think this is good.

419
00:43:08,989 --> 00:43:10,323
We're far enough out here.

420
00:43:11,759 --> 00:43:13,424
- Are you sure?

421
00:43:13,426 --> 00:43:14,593
- Yeah I used
to come out here hiking

422
00:43:14,595 --> 00:43:16,094
when I was a kid, all the time.

423
00:43:16,096 --> 00:43:18,329
Nobody ever comes out here this
far.

424
00:43:18,331 --> 00:43:20,966
- I don't know about that.

425
00:43:20,968 --> 00:43:23,301
I guess I'll take a look
around the perimeter,

426
00:43:23,303 --> 00:43:24,670
make sure we're alone.

427
00:43:24,672 --> 00:43:27,973
- Yeah, why don't you go do
that.

428
00:43:46,994 --> 00:43:49,963
Let's get you a path here
sweetie.

429
00:43:50,463 --> 00:43:52,099
So you can go take a pill.

430
00:44:05,212 --> 00:44:06,745
Come on.

431
00:44:19,126 --> 00:44:19,958
- What the hell?

432
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:20,792
- Fucker.

433
00:44:49,422 --> 00:44:50,423
- Oh, you're back.

434
00:44:51,424 --> 00:44:54,593
Ooh, ooh, careful.

435
00:44:54,595 --> 00:44:56,564
Oh, don't take it too fast.

436
00:44:58,766 --> 00:44:59,598
Here.

437
00:45:05,038 --> 00:45:06,004
- I love you.

438
00:45:06,006 --> 00:45:06,874
- I love you too.

439
00:45:10,010 --> 00:45:12,544
- What am I gonna do, should I
just leave?

440
00:45:12,546 --> 00:45:15,213
- No, absolutely not.

441
00:45:15,215 --> 00:45:16,249
It'll be just fine.

442
00:45:17,751 --> 00:45:19,084
We're gonna beat him at his own
game

443
00:45:19,086 --> 00:45:21,421
and we'll be set for life.

444
00:45:22,523 --> 00:45:23,356
Okay.

445
00:45:25,158 --> 00:45:26,026
All right, I'm in.

446
00:45:27,695 --> 00:45:29,763
You always make me feel better.

447
00:45:30,931 --> 00:45:31,897
- Shew.

448
00:45:31,899 --> 00:45:32,764
- Did it work?

449
00:45:32,766 --> 00:45:33,732
- It worked.

450
00:45:33,734 --> 00:45:35,133
He went down.

451
00:45:35,135 --> 00:45:37,235
Just easy as pie.

452
00:45:37,237 --> 00:45:41,640
Come on.

453
00:45:41,642 --> 00:45:43,408
Come on, all right.

454
00:45:43,410 --> 00:45:44,743
Ooh, steady on your feet.

455
00:45:44,745 --> 00:45:45,746
Oh, you okay?

456
00:45:48,582 --> 00:45:49,583
- My head hurts.

457
00:45:50,551 --> 00:45:52,217
My throat's really sore.

458
00:45:52,219 --> 00:45:53,351
- No kidding.

459
00:45:53,353 --> 00:45:55,954
Fucker, strangled the
fuck outta you, didn't he?

460
00:45:55,956 --> 00:45:56,955
- Yeah, he did.

461
00:45:56,957 --> 00:45:57,789
Is he gone?

462
00:45:57,791 --> 00:45:59,059
- He's gone, down the well.

463
00:46:00,728 --> 00:46:01,192
- Uh.

464
00:46:01,194 --> 00:46:01,729
- Thank you.

465
00:46:02,630 --> 00:46:04,497
And you can collect the life
insurance.

466
00:46:05,699 --> 00:46:08,299
But I think our plan worked.

467
00:46:08,301 --> 00:46:11,004
The drug I gave you,
that you put in your tea,

468
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:13,171
knocked you out pretty good.

469
00:46:13,173 --> 00:46:14,472
I was kind of freaked out

470
00:46:14,474 --> 00:46:18,644
when I saw you all wrapped in
plastic, but it's all over.

471
00:46:18,646 --> 00:46:19,477
- Thank God.

472
00:46:19,479 --> 00:46:20,313
- It's okay.

473
00:46:22,983 --> 00:46:25,519
- All right, let's try
to get the fuck outta here.

474
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:41,334
- Come on.

475
00:48:21,835 --> 00:48:23,001
- Oh fuck, oh geez.

476
00:48:23,003 --> 00:48:26,505
Oh God, oh fuck.

477
00:48:26,507 --> 00:48:28,607
- Oh God.
- Oh my God.

478
00:48:28,609 --> 00:48:30,341
- Oh fuck, oh shit, oh God.

479
00:48:30,343 --> 00:48:31,777
Ow.
- Oh my God.

480
00:48:31,779 --> 00:48:32,613
Oh my God.

481
00:48:33,681 --> 00:48:34,513
- Oh God.

482
00:48:34,515 --> 00:48:35,814
Let go, I'm sorry.

483
00:48:35,816 --> 00:48:37,482
- Oh God, okay.
- I'm sorry.

484
00:48:37,484 --> 00:48:38,316
- Oh God.
- I'm sorry.

485
00:48:38,318 --> 00:48:39,150
- Okay, okay.

486
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:41,419
- Okay, it's okay.

487
00:48:41,421 --> 00:48:43,121
Oh just, you gotta keep it
together,

488
00:48:43,123 --> 00:48:45,156
you gotta keep it together
please.

489
00:48:45,158 --> 00:48:46,091
Please.

490
00:48:46,093 --> 00:48:47,125
Okay.
- Okay.

491
00:48:47,127 --> 00:48:48,126
- What you're gonna do

492
00:48:48,128 --> 00:48:49,961
is you're gonna have to go back
to the car

493
00:48:49,963 --> 00:48:52,631
and you have to get a tire
iron or fucking something,

494
00:48:52,633 --> 00:48:53,799
anything, I don't give a shit.

495
00:48:53,801 --> 00:48:54,966
- Okay.

496
00:48:54,968 --> 00:48:56,768
- And go and get it so I can
get this trap off my leg.

497
00:48:56,770 --> 00:48:57,636
- Okay.
- Please.

498
00:48:57,638 --> 00:48:58,469
- I'll be right back.

499
00:48:58,471 --> 00:48:59,304
- Oh fuck it hurts.

500
00:48:59,306 --> 00:49:00,138
- Don't go anywhere.

501
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:01,308
- Oh God fuck.

502
00:49:02,309 --> 00:49:04,745
Oh God, oh God I'm gonna die.

503
00:49:11,719 --> 00:49:12,984
Okay.

504
00:49:12,986 --> 00:49:13,821
Okay.

505
00:49:18,692 --> 00:49:20,193
What the fuck was that?

506
00:49:24,331 --> 00:49:26,565
Lucy, was that you?

507
00:49:40,548 --> 00:49:41,880
Oh shit.

508
00:49:41,882 --> 00:49:43,048
Oh fuck.

509
00:49:46,053 --> 00:49:47,285
Oh fuck.

510
00:49:47,287 --> 00:49:48,720
Oh fuck.

511
00:49:48,722 --> 00:49:50,221
Oh fuck.

512
00:49:50,223 --> 00:49:51,723
Our fuck.

513
00:49:51,725 --> 00:49:52,958
Our fuck.

514
00:50:09,409 --> 00:50:13,011
- "And Jesus roared, Lazarus
come out."

515
00:51:00,293 --> 00:51:01,194
You're not going anywhere.

516
00:51:04,732 --> 00:51:07,200
And the devil was an angel.

517
00:51:09,803 --> 00:51:10,738
Bitch!

518
00:52:57,210 --> 00:52:59,745
- A flaming wildfire
that shut down a stretch

519
00:52:59,747 --> 00:53:03,549
of a major Interstate near the
Appalachian mountain border

520
00:53:03,551 --> 00:53:06,918
exploded in size as crews on
Sunday,

521
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:11,156
scrambled to prevent flames
from reaching rural communities.

522
00:53:11,158 --> 00:53:13,659
The blaze and Red River National
Forest

523
00:53:13,661 --> 00:53:15,360
was burning out of control

524
00:53:15,362 --> 00:53:18,864
after chewing through 69 square
miles

525
00:53:18,866 --> 00:53:21,800
of timber and brush since
Thursday.

526
00:53:21,802 --> 00:53:23,902
Firefighters working in a rugged
terrain

527
00:53:23,904 --> 00:53:27,806
were contending with hot
temperatures and gusty winds.

528
00:53:27,808 --> 00:53:29,641
Authorities announced Friday

529
00:53:29,643 --> 00:53:33,712
that a 44 mile section of
Interstate 64,

530
00:53:33,714 --> 00:53:36,882
North of Cravenburg would remain
closed

531
00:53:36,884 --> 00:53:38,684
until further notice.

532
00:53:38,686 --> 00:53:43,121
In one section, the remains
of three charred bodies

533
00:53:43,123 --> 00:53:46,725
have been discovered in what
is currently being investigated

534
00:53:46,727 --> 00:53:49,730
as a possible murder/suicide
situation.

535
00:53:50,631 --> 00:53:53,264
No one is sure what started the
fires,

536
00:53:53,266 --> 00:53:55,869
but a full investigation is
underway.

537
00:53:57,204 --> 00:53:58,336
This is an ongoing story y'all

538
00:53:58,338 --> 00:54:01,108
so stay tuned for further
details as we get them.

539
00:54:24,798 --> 00:54:27,768
- What's the matter, last one
wasn't scary enough for you?

540
00:54:29,002 --> 00:54:32,139
- It was good,
but it's not what I want.

541
00:54:33,507 --> 00:54:34,474
- Who is this?

542
00:54:35,342 --> 00:54:37,809
- You
have two more stories,

543
00:54:37,811 --> 00:54:39,312
two more chances.

544
00:54:41,014 --> 00:54:43,448
- Did Barry put you up to this?

545
00:54:43,450 --> 00:54:44,516
- I don't
want just anyone's fears,

546
00:54:44,518 --> 00:54:49,156
Natalie, I want your
fears, your greatest fear.

547
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:55,462
- How did you know my name?

548
00:55:57,290 --> 00:55:59,560
- Can you cut that out man,

549
00:56:00,928 --> 00:56:02,329
it is really annoying.

550
00:56:14,207 --> 00:56:15,776
Oh motherfucker.

551
00:56:34,528 --> 00:56:36,862
Hey, get back here.

552
00:56:39,967 --> 00:56:43,270
- I have
no home, but I still hope.

553
00:56:44,404 --> 00:56:46,805
Some nights I get to sleep, but
sadly,

554
00:56:46,807 --> 00:56:48,406
it's only to wake up and be back

555
00:56:48,408 --> 00:56:50,742
in this living fucking hell.

556
00:56:50,744 --> 00:56:54,081
This is not me, it's what I've
become.

557
00:56:55,583 --> 00:56:56,948
The sidewalks are cold,

558
00:56:56,950 --> 00:56:59,551
but not as cold as the
people that just walk by,

559
00:56:59,553 --> 00:57:02,387
not looking or caring.

560
00:57:02,389 --> 00:57:04,958
To them, we could all
probably just be dead.

561
00:57:06,126 --> 00:57:08,960
They are the judge and jury.

562
00:57:08,962 --> 00:57:10,864
The streets, our executioner.

563
00:57:15,035 --> 00:57:17,671
I'm scared, can you believe it?

564
00:57:18,839 --> 00:57:19,840
Please believe it.

565
00:57:20,841 --> 00:57:22,373
I don't.

566
00:57:22,375 --> 00:57:23,811
But I need someone to.

567
00:57:24,845 --> 00:57:26,547
I know I'll die out here.

568
00:57:27,515 --> 00:57:29,548
I'm not worried about that part.

569
00:57:29,550 --> 00:57:31,482
I'm more worried about
what'll happen to my body

570
00:57:31,484 --> 00:57:32,853
after my soul has left it.

571
00:57:34,021 --> 00:57:36,688
But not scared.

572
00:57:36,690 --> 00:57:39,827
The streets can be cruel,
the streets can be tough.

573
00:57:40,994 --> 00:57:45,165
But for better or worse, the
streets are always watching.

574
00:57:46,333 --> 00:57:48,333
- I have to save you.

575
00:57:48,335 --> 00:57:49,935
- Oh shit there he is.

576
00:57:49,937 --> 00:57:50,936
- Good old KKK.

577
00:57:50,938 --> 00:57:52,037
- KKK?

578
00:57:52,039 --> 00:57:54,940
- Yeah, Kray Kray Karl,
the guy's a fucking nut.

579
00:57:54,942 --> 00:57:56,174
- Guy's fucking dangerous.

580
00:57:56,176 --> 00:57:57,876
You're gonna wanna stay clear of
him.

581
00:57:57,878 --> 00:57:58,946
- Get real Spliff.

582
00:58:00,113 --> 00:58:00,946
He's harmless.

583
00:58:00,948 --> 00:58:02,714
I've been around him constantly.

584
00:58:02,716 --> 00:58:04,716
- Harmless my ass.

585
00:58:04,718 --> 00:58:06,484
I've heard so much about this
guy.

586
00:58:06,486 --> 00:58:07,485
- Like what?

587
00:58:07,487 --> 00:58:09,254
- Shit man, where do I begin?

588
00:58:09,256 --> 00:58:13,158
There's so many theories
on what made KKK, KKK.

589
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:15,761
He to be one of the biggest
drug dealers in the city.

590
00:58:15,763 --> 00:58:17,829
He controlled everything around
here.

591
00:58:17,831 --> 00:58:19,598
And then one day a rival drug
dealer

592
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:22,668
put like a lethal dose
of LSD in his drink.

593
00:58:22,670 --> 00:58:24,536
He drank that in wet nuts,

594
00:58:24,538 --> 00:58:27,372
ended up killing half
the people at some party.

595
00:58:29,476 --> 00:58:31,142
The ones who survived were so
scared

596
00:58:31,144 --> 00:58:32,711
that they never testify.

597
00:58:32,713 --> 00:58:35,146
So the police like can't
even pin anything on him.

598
00:58:35,148 --> 00:58:36,884
And that's how he got the name
KKK.

599
00:58:37,718 --> 00:58:40,320
Krazy Killer Karl.

600
00:58:41,421 --> 00:58:42,588
- That's bullshit.

601
00:58:42,590 --> 00:58:43,989
That's not what I heard at all.

602
00:58:43,991 --> 00:58:45,924
I heard one day he got the
bright idea

603
00:58:45,926 --> 00:58:47,458
he was gonna rob a dice game.

604
00:58:47,460 --> 00:58:48,994
He almost got away with it,

605
00:58:48,996 --> 00:58:51,530
but they caught up with
him at his mom's house,

606
00:58:51,532 --> 00:58:55,300
raped and killed her right in
front of him in retaliation.

607
00:58:55,302 --> 00:58:57,569
And it was so much that he just
snapped.

608
00:58:57,571 --> 00:58:59,204
So now he wanders the streets

609
00:58:59,206 --> 00:59:00,972
trying to write the wrongs of
that night.

610
00:59:00,974 --> 00:59:03,174
And that's why he is always
fighting the air and shit,

611
00:59:03,176 --> 00:59:05,310
he's trying to fight them
demons.

612
00:59:08,481 --> 00:59:10,415
Yo, that's deep.

613
00:59:10,417 --> 00:59:11,783
- Fighting the demons yo.

614
00:59:11,785 --> 00:59:14,052
- That's fucking stupid,
that's what that is.

615
00:59:14,054 --> 00:59:16,087
He's just some poor schmuck like
us,

616
00:59:16,089 --> 00:59:18,959
stuck on the streets, trying
to make a way from himself.

617
00:59:21,862 --> 00:59:25,063
- No, that motherfucker is a
killer.

618
00:59:25,065 --> 00:59:27,098
You know, he is the one
who killed Niles, right?

619
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:28,299
- Shut the fuck up.

620
00:59:28,301 --> 00:59:29,400
- What?

621
00:59:29,402 --> 00:59:31,503
You know, he was the last
one to be seen with him.

622
00:59:31,505 --> 00:59:33,271
I heard he killed a bunch of us.

623
00:59:33,273 --> 00:59:36,274
Just nobody cares because
it's people like us.

624
00:59:36,276 --> 00:59:39,645
If you ask me, he's working for
the police to get rid of us.

625
00:59:39,647 --> 00:59:41,446
- Where are you getting
this shit from, man?

626
00:59:41,448 --> 00:59:42,848
- Where am I getting it from?

627
00:59:42,850 --> 00:59:45,619
Three of us dead in two
weeks, that doesn't worry you?

628
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:48,286
Everyone thinks that fool's
harmless,

629
00:59:48,288 --> 00:59:51,590
but I'm just saying, watch
your fucking back out here.

630
00:59:51,592 --> 00:59:54,292
- He ain't no cop, I
heard he killed a pig.

631
00:59:54,294 --> 00:59:55,594
- My fucking hero.

632
00:59:57,264 --> 00:59:59,130
- They don't
trust us.

633
00:59:59,132 --> 01:00:00,999
We don't trust us.

634
01:00:01,001 --> 01:00:03,001
We wanna believe we're better.

635
01:00:03,003 --> 01:00:05,436
Better than the ones that judge.

636
01:00:05,438 --> 01:00:06,437
We're not.

637
01:00:19,787 --> 01:00:21,252
- Yo, he's coming this way.

638
01:00:21,254 --> 01:00:23,989
- I have to save you.

639
01:00:23,991 --> 01:00:26,625
- Save this you fucking
dickhead.

640
01:00:26,627 --> 01:00:28,794
- It can never
get worse.

641
01:00:28,796 --> 01:00:30,330
I repeat that constantly.

642
01:00:31,331 --> 01:00:35,901
But constantly, constantly
I'm reminded that it can.

643
01:00:43,844 --> 01:00:46,177
- Everything copacetic?

644
01:00:46,179 --> 01:00:47,014
- Totally.

645
01:00:47,848 --> 01:00:51,182
I'm homeless, drunk and horny.

646
01:00:51,184 --> 01:00:53,118
What more could I ask for?

647
01:00:53,120 --> 01:00:55,823
- I could help you with one
of those things, you know.

648
01:00:56,824 --> 01:00:58,957
- Really, you could get me a
home?

649
01:00:58,959 --> 01:01:00,726
- You have a home.

650
01:01:00,728 --> 01:01:01,893
- Just like Niles did.

651
01:01:01,895 --> 01:01:05,030
- What, you're letting
that KKK story get to you?

652
01:01:05,032 --> 01:01:06,698
- What if it's true?

653
01:01:06,700 --> 01:01:09,167
What if one way or another
the stories are true?

654
01:01:09,169 --> 01:01:11,737
What if KKK is killing us?

655
01:01:14,141 --> 01:01:16,274
- Well, I have to salute you

656
01:01:16,276 --> 01:01:20,145
because you, my friend,
are officially flagged.

657
01:01:31,058 --> 01:01:31,892
- Thank you.

658
01:01:34,427 --> 01:01:35,627
- Don't thank me.

659
01:01:35,629 --> 01:01:36,597
I'll be right back.

660
01:01:54,615 --> 01:01:56,515
- God, I had a fucking piss.

661
01:02:03,156 --> 01:02:06,257
Oh, Karl, what's up?

662
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:14,902
- I must save you.

663
01:02:16,069 --> 01:02:18,737
- No saving needed, my friend.

664
01:02:18,739 --> 01:02:21,907
We're all drinking over on
Fifth, if you wanna come by.

665
01:02:21,909 --> 01:02:22,941
I got a handle of a.

666
01:02:22,943 --> 01:02:25,811
- I must save you.

667
01:02:25,813 --> 01:02:28,081
- Karl, what the fuck
are you talking about?

668
01:02:30,483 --> 01:02:32,751
- I must save you.

669
01:02:32,753 --> 01:02:34,219
- Fuck are you doing, man?

670
01:02:34,221 --> 01:02:35,623
Get the fuck away from me.

671
01:03:41,589 --> 01:03:43,188
I deserve this.

672
01:03:43,190 --> 01:03:44,525
- No, you don't.

673
01:03:46,193 --> 01:03:47,761
I have to save you.

674
01:03:49,930 --> 01:03:51,932
- There is no saving me.

675
01:03:56,604 --> 01:03:58,036
- This is it.

676
01:03:58,038 --> 01:04:01,773
I've been waiting,
waiting longer than most.

677
01:04:01,775 --> 01:04:04,710
Shorter than the ones
who never had to be here.

678
01:04:04,712 --> 01:04:06,645
I always knew it would come,

679
01:04:06,647 --> 01:04:09,447
always knew it wouldn't be how I
wanted,

680
01:04:09,449 --> 01:04:12,250
but I didn't think it'd be like
this.

681
01:04:12,252 --> 01:04:14,620
Strangely, my thoughts turned to
him.

682
01:04:14,622 --> 01:04:16,321
What brought him to this place?

683
01:04:16,323 --> 01:04:18,191
What brought his punishment to
me?

684
01:04:20,493 --> 01:04:24,329
- I have to save you.

685
01:04:24,331 --> 01:04:27,434
- No, this is
not how it ends, not from me.

686
01:04:31,839 --> 01:04:35,406
- I have to save you.

687
01:04:50,190 --> 01:04:51,823
- 911, what's your
emergency?

688
01:04:51,825 --> 01:04:54,359
- Hello, help please.

689
01:04:54,361 --> 01:04:56,327
He's chasing me, I think
he's gonna kill me.

690
01:04:56,329 --> 01:04:57,863
- Where are you
calling from?

691
01:04:57,865 --> 01:04:59,197
- I don't know.

692
01:05:11,111 --> 01:05:11,943
Please.

693
01:05:37,938 --> 01:05:39,137
- What are we gonna.

694
01:05:39,139 --> 01:05:40,972
Hell no, you just hit a little
white girl,

695
01:05:40,974 --> 01:05:42,173
we gotta get the fuck outta here
now.

696
01:05:42,175 --> 01:05:43,609
- Holy shit.

697
01:05:51,018 --> 01:05:51,983
- Oh.

698
01:05:51,985 --> 01:05:52,786
Oh.

699
01:05:55,455 --> 01:05:56,289
Oh fuck.

700
01:06:01,962 --> 01:06:03,296
- That church,

701
01:06:05,833 --> 01:06:07,000
that God,

702
01:06:08,969 --> 01:06:10,470
they can't save you.

703
01:06:11,872 --> 01:06:12,973
Only I can.

704
01:06:13,874 --> 01:06:15,473
- Please,

705
01:06:15,475 --> 01:06:16,476
I don't need saving.

706
01:06:17,645 --> 01:06:19,545
- That's where you're wrong.

707
01:06:19,547 --> 01:06:24,149
At one point or another,
we all need saving.

708
01:06:28,188 --> 01:06:30,190
I'm going to save you.

709
01:06:32,693 --> 01:06:37,698
I couldn't save the others,
but I'm going to save you.

710
01:08:18,966 --> 01:08:22,701
- I have no
home, but I still have hope.

711
01:08:22,703 --> 01:08:24,037
Some nights I get to sleep.

712
01:08:25,506 --> 01:08:28,308
This is not me, it's what I've
become.

713
01:08:29,643 --> 01:08:32,177
And what have I become?

714
01:08:32,179 --> 01:08:33,013
What have.

715
01:08:34,181 --> 01:08:37,150
- You should have let him save
you.

716
01:09:29,469 --> 01:09:31,304
- Hey Barry, it's Nat.

717
01:09:32,372 --> 01:09:34,205
Where are you?

718
01:09:34,207 --> 01:09:36,009
Just call me back when you get
this.

719
01:09:41,481 --> 01:09:43,181
- I am waiting.

720
01:09:43,183 --> 01:09:47,986
- What do you want?

721
01:09:50,658 --> 01:09:53,927
- You know what
I want?

722
01:09:54,995 --> 01:09:55,829
- I already,

723
01:09:56,764 --> 01:09:57,965
you've got your stories.

724
01:09:58,932 --> 01:10:00,832
- What is it,
Natalie?

725
01:10:00,834 --> 01:10:03,168
What really scares you?

726
01:10:07,708 --> 01:10:09,710
- All right, I'll do it.

727
01:10:27,795 --> 01:10:29,630
- Not just any
story.

728
01:10:34,001 --> 01:10:36,935
Something really terrifying.

729
01:10:39,072 --> 01:10:40,207
Horrifying.

730
01:10:52,219 --> 01:10:55,188
I want you to scare yourself to
death.

731
01:11:26,153 --> 01:11:28,787
- Hey Mike, are you at
the rental house yet?

732
01:11:28,789 --> 01:11:30,958
The camera package should be
ready to go.

733
01:11:31,825 --> 01:11:33,293
John's waiting for you guys.

734
01:11:34,461 --> 01:11:36,764
I ended up going with
the Zeit lenses on this.

735
01:11:38,131 --> 01:11:38,966
Yeah.

736
01:11:42,069 --> 01:11:43,303
Yeah, we just rolled in.

737
01:11:45,973 --> 01:11:48,008
When, are you getting, what's
that?

738
01:11:49,476 --> 01:11:50,310
Mike?

739
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:34,387
Looks like we're the first ones
here.

740
01:12:38,759 --> 01:12:40,325
Wanna pick out a bedroom?

741
01:12:40,327 --> 01:12:41,161
We got dibs.

742
01:12:45,599 --> 01:12:47,298
- I'm actually,

743
01:12:47,300 --> 01:12:49,937
I'm kind of tired from the
drive.

744
01:12:50,838 --> 01:12:51,670
- You're tired?

745
01:12:51,672 --> 01:12:52,971
- Yeah.

746
01:12:52,973 --> 01:12:54,474
- You slept the entire way up.

747
01:12:57,545 --> 01:13:00,881
Come on, you see outside, it's
beautiful.

748
01:13:02,449 --> 01:13:03,450
Let's go for a walk.

749
01:13:04,618 --> 01:13:05,519
- I'd like that.

750
01:13:16,697 --> 01:13:17,531
- Laura hold on.

751
01:13:18,398 --> 01:13:20,198
Move into the light.

752
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:22,734
- Taylor God.

753
01:13:22,736 --> 01:13:25,405
- Can't help it, the camera
loves you.

754
01:13:27,240 --> 01:13:28,609
- But do you love me?

755
01:13:29,643 --> 01:13:32,644
- Shh, don't ruin the shot.

756
01:13:40,253 --> 01:13:41,386
Nice.

757
01:13:45,893 --> 01:13:47,094
- Do you hear that sound?

758
01:13:49,229 --> 01:13:51,396
I heard it when we first got
here.

759
01:13:51,398 --> 01:13:53,967
- It's probably someone
doing yard work or something.

760
01:13:55,435 --> 01:13:58,103
So much for the peace and quiet
out here.

761
01:13:59,940 --> 01:14:01,773
- I've never heard
anything like it before.

762
01:14:01,775 --> 01:14:03,611
- Shh, don't be weird.

763
01:14:04,845 --> 01:14:06,211
Stay still.

764
01:14:10,684 --> 01:14:11,519
Nice.

765
01:14:12,820 --> 01:14:13,854
Yeah, hold that pose.

766
01:14:15,656 --> 01:14:17,322
I'm really liking this.

767
01:14:18,191 --> 01:14:20,458
I'm gonna make you a famous
model.

768
01:14:27,535 --> 01:14:29,034
Laura.

769
01:14:29,036 --> 01:14:29,870
What?

770
01:14:32,272 --> 01:14:33,841
- I saw something there.

771
01:14:35,676 --> 01:14:37,208
- I don't see anything.

772
01:14:37,210 --> 01:14:38,712
- It was there, I saw it.

773
01:14:39,613 --> 01:14:40,846
- You saw someone in the woods.

774
01:14:40,848 --> 01:14:44,351
- No, it wasn't a person it
was, it's hard to explain.

775
01:14:46,186 --> 01:14:48,421
It was like, I don't know.

776
01:14:51,859 --> 01:14:53,692
- It wasn't Bigfoot, was it?

777
01:14:53,694 --> 01:14:56,496
- Taylor, no I'm serious please.

778
01:14:58,098 --> 01:14:58,932
- Come on.

779
01:15:00,200 --> 01:15:01,733
You know what I think,

780
01:15:01,735 --> 01:15:03,635
I think all this fresh mountain
air

781
01:15:03,637 --> 01:15:05,873
is just driving us a little
crazy.

782
01:15:07,775 --> 01:15:09,207
- Yeah, maybe.

783
01:15:17,017 --> 01:15:20,253
- Now let's pick out our master
bedroom.

784
01:15:22,455 --> 01:15:23,290
Yeah?

785
01:15:26,459 --> 01:15:27,358
- Hold on.

786
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:29,294
Wait, there's someone here I
think.

787
01:15:29,296 --> 01:15:34,301
Look at this.

788
01:15:41,975 --> 01:15:43,811
- Oh, isn't this a nice
surprise?

789
01:15:46,179 --> 01:15:47,014
- Hi.

790
01:15:48,982 --> 01:15:51,819
- I was beginning to think I
had the place all to myself.

791
01:15:54,054 --> 01:15:55,322
I could use some help.

792
01:16:03,296 --> 01:16:04,129
Thanks.

793
01:16:04,131 --> 01:16:06,466
So when did you two get here?

794
01:16:09,169 --> 01:16:10,101
- A few hours ago?

795
01:16:10,103 --> 01:16:10,938
- Yeah.

796
01:16:11,805 --> 01:16:12,738
- Beat the traffic.

797
01:16:12,740 --> 01:16:16,276
I'm Taylor, by the way, I'm the
DP.

798
01:16:17,310 --> 01:16:20,113
- Oh, Alexis, key makeup and
hair.

799
01:16:21,815 --> 01:16:24,149
Are you with the camera
department too?

800
01:16:24,151 --> 01:16:27,621
- Oh no, I'm just here
with Taylor, I'm Laura.

801
01:16:29,590 --> 01:16:32,423
- You'll probably wanna go
back to L.A. after a few days.

802
01:16:32,425 --> 01:16:34,092
Movie sets aren't nearly as
exciting

803
01:16:34,094 --> 01:16:35,994
or glamorous as people think.

804
01:16:35,996 --> 01:16:38,832
- It's okay, I'm just gonna
work on my dissertation.

805
01:16:39,933 --> 01:16:41,600
- Oh, you're still in school?

806
01:16:41,602 --> 01:16:42,670
How'd you guys meet?

807
01:16:46,840 --> 01:16:48,509
- We're throwing a party or?

808
01:16:49,643 --> 01:16:51,510
- Oh, you know these mountain
towns,

809
01:16:51,512 --> 01:16:56,114
they have one bar up here
and last calls at 10.

810
01:16:56,116 --> 01:16:59,452
I like to wine at the end of
the day, don't you, Taylor?

811
01:17:01,254 --> 01:17:04,289
- Speaking of, should we go get
cleaned up

812
01:17:04,291 --> 01:17:05,859
before everyone else gets here?

813
01:17:06,860 --> 01:17:07,695
- Yeah, sure.

814
01:17:10,698 --> 01:17:12,566
- Save some hot water for me.

815
01:17:20,407 --> 01:17:22,874
- So my roommate had an extra
ticket

816
01:17:22,876 --> 01:17:25,076
and she dragged me to the
concert.

817
01:17:25,078 --> 01:17:28,213
And then Taylor was on stage
shooting

818
01:17:28,215 --> 01:17:29,480
and I was in the front row.

819
01:17:29,482 --> 01:17:30,749
- You kept getting in my shot.

820
01:17:30,751 --> 01:17:31,717
- Yeah.

821
01:17:31,719 --> 01:17:33,721
And then you hunted me down
afterward.

822
01:17:35,355 --> 01:17:37,222
And that's the story.

823
01:17:37,224 --> 01:17:38,790
- Say when.
- No, I'm good.

824
01:17:38,792 --> 01:17:40,726
- Okay.

825
01:17:40,728 --> 01:17:42,360
- Thanks for making
dinner.

826
01:17:42,362 --> 01:17:43,428
- Yeah.

827
01:17:43,430 --> 01:17:45,365
- What'd you
say was in the sauce?

828
01:17:46,700 --> 01:17:50,068
- Well, some old family recipe.

829
01:17:50,070 --> 01:17:51,770
I usually make it spicier,

830
01:17:51,772 --> 01:17:54,942
but I figure it was hot enough
already.

831
01:17:57,010 --> 01:17:58,343
- I didn't notice.

832
01:17:58,345 --> 01:17:59,277
- Are you kidding?

833
01:17:59,279 --> 01:18:03,081
It had to be like 85 when I got
here.

834
01:18:03,083 --> 01:18:05,717
It's like, isn't it
supposed to get colder,

835
01:18:05,719 --> 01:18:07,452
the higher you go?

836
01:18:07,454 --> 01:18:08,854
It's like November.

837
01:18:08,856 --> 01:18:11,358
- You were probably standing
too close to the stove.

838
01:18:13,026 --> 01:18:14,995
- Or maybe it was hot flashes.

839
01:18:15,996 --> 01:18:16,830
I'm just kidding.

840
01:18:18,498 --> 01:18:20,331
- It's getting pretty late.

841
01:18:20,333 --> 01:18:23,835
I wonder when the others
are gonna show up.

842
01:18:23,837 --> 01:18:26,037
- Maybe they found about a gig.

843
01:18:26,039 --> 01:18:28,676
- Mike was on the five the
last time I spoke to him.

844
01:18:29,543 --> 01:18:31,910
- Or maybe he's drunk off his at
a bar

845
01:18:31,912 --> 01:18:35,549
like that gaffer on that
one show, you remember?

846
01:18:36,684 --> 01:18:39,885
His girlfriend was like
freaking out and she's all like,

847
01:18:39,887 --> 01:18:41,086
"Where's Keith?"

848
01:18:41,088 --> 01:18:44,022
And we're all like, well
why are you asking us?

849
01:18:44,024 --> 01:18:45,859
We thought he was at home with
you.

850
01:18:47,060 --> 01:18:49,663
- Wait, did do you guys,
you worked together before.

851
01:18:51,699 --> 01:18:52,533
- Did we?

852
01:18:54,735 --> 01:18:55,934
That's right.

853
01:18:55,936 --> 01:18:58,303
I knew you looked familiar.

854
01:18:58,305 --> 01:19:00,471
God, that must have been years
ago,

855
01:19:00,473 --> 01:19:02,075
I can't believe I forgot.

856
01:19:06,146 --> 01:19:10,048
- Anyway, why don't we carpool
tomorrow?

857
01:19:10,050 --> 01:19:12,553
Be like just me and my kit.

858
01:19:13,486 --> 01:19:15,455
Unless you're planning on
coming.

859
01:19:16,489 --> 01:19:19,691
- Oh no, I have work to do.

860
01:19:19,693 --> 01:19:24,131
In fact, I think I'm gonna
turn in a little bit early.

861
01:19:26,199 --> 01:19:27,668
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

862
01:20:01,969 --> 01:20:02,803
- Fuck.

863
01:20:04,872 --> 01:20:07,506
Fucking first timers.

864
01:20:07,508 --> 01:20:09,710
I knew I should not have taken
this gig.

865
01:20:10,544 --> 01:20:11,777
- What happened?

866
01:20:11,779 --> 01:20:13,044
- Nothing.

867
01:20:13,046 --> 01:20:14,546
- Alexis and I were the only
ones

868
01:20:14,548 --> 01:20:16,049
that showed up at the location.

869
01:20:17,685 --> 01:20:19,350
- That's so weird, I wonder what
happened.

870
01:20:19,352 --> 01:20:20,218
Where'd they go?

871
01:20:20,220 --> 01:20:22,253
- How the fuck should I know?

872
01:20:22,255 --> 01:20:24,322
We were texting, leaving
voicemails,

873
01:20:24,324 --> 01:20:25,857
trying to get a hold of
somebody.

874
01:20:25,859 --> 01:20:27,358
Nothing, radio silence.

875
01:20:27,360 --> 01:20:30,361
It's like someone pulled the
goddamn plug on the shoot

876
01:20:30,363 --> 01:20:32,430
and did not have the balls to
tell us.

877
01:20:32,432 --> 01:20:33,532
- Sorry Taylor.

878
01:20:33,534 --> 01:20:34,700
- Did you hear anything?

879
01:20:34,702 --> 01:20:36,034
- No.

880
01:20:36,036 --> 01:20:37,971
Honey it's sweltering in here.

881
01:20:40,974 --> 01:20:42,774
- Hey Mike, missed you today.

882
01:20:42,776 --> 01:20:44,745
Where the fuck are you?

883
01:20:45,979 --> 01:20:47,548
Why did you not come?

884
01:20:49,049 --> 01:20:50,248
Fuck.

885
01:20:50,250 --> 01:20:52,551
God dammit.

886
01:20:52,553 --> 01:20:54,753
- Well, this thing's useless.

887
01:20:54,755 --> 01:20:56,089
Are you getting a signal?

888
01:20:57,057 --> 01:20:59,525
- My phone's upstairs.

889
01:20:59,527 --> 01:21:00,894
- Could you give it a try?

890
01:21:02,262 --> 01:21:04,364
- Yeah, sure.

891
01:21:14,875 --> 01:21:15,874
- Is the AC working?

892
01:21:15,876 --> 01:21:17,410
'Cause it doesn't seem like it.

893
01:21:19,412 --> 01:21:21,181
- Will you calm down.

894
01:21:26,319 --> 01:21:27,154
- Jesus.

895
01:21:35,996 --> 01:21:36,830
- Any luck?

896
01:21:37,698 --> 01:21:39,230
- Nope, nothing.

897
01:21:39,232 --> 01:21:40,699
Sorry.

898
01:21:40,701 --> 01:21:42,701
- This is bullshit.

899
01:21:42,703 --> 01:21:44,736
I don't know about you
two, but I'm ready to bail.

900
01:21:44,738 --> 01:21:46,605
- There's no way I'm driving
three hours

901
01:21:46,607 --> 01:21:48,073
back to L.A. tonight.

902
01:21:48,075 --> 01:21:49,875
I'm fucking exhausted.

903
01:21:49,877 --> 01:21:52,077
- Same, I didn't get any sleep.

904
01:21:52,079 --> 01:21:57,048
I mean it didn't even get
dark until after midnight.

905
01:21:57,050 --> 01:22:00,752
- Okay, I think that we
should all get some rest.

906
01:22:00,754 --> 01:22:03,421
I'll drive into town and
try to get a landline

907
01:22:03,423 --> 01:22:05,490
or a signal or something.

908
01:22:05,492 --> 01:22:06,459
- Really okay?

909
01:22:08,428 --> 01:22:09,260
Be careful.

910
01:22:09,262 --> 01:22:10,929
- I'll be right back.

911
01:22:18,005 --> 01:22:21,274
- No wifi, no cell service.

912
01:22:22,275 --> 01:22:24,442
Not even a frigging TV.

913
01:22:24,444 --> 01:22:26,013
Really are in the boonies.

914
01:22:27,681 --> 01:22:31,482
I've done makeup on over 30
shows and I've seen some shit,

915
01:22:31,484 --> 01:22:33,486
but nothing like this.

916
01:22:36,990 --> 01:22:38,790
Hey, you want a makeover?

917
01:22:38,792 --> 01:22:39,793
We've got the time.

918
01:22:41,128 --> 01:22:42,460
- No, thank you.

919
01:22:43,631 --> 01:22:45,430
- What are you writing anyway?

920
01:22:45,432 --> 01:22:47,165
- My dissertation.

921
01:22:47,167 --> 01:22:48,499
- Right.

922
01:22:48,501 --> 01:22:50,503
Taylor told me you're a science
major.

923
01:22:51,905 --> 01:22:53,672
- Environmental science.

924
01:22:53,674 --> 01:22:55,073
- Oh.

925
01:22:55,075 --> 01:22:56,675
Gonna save the world, huh?

926
01:22:56,677 --> 01:22:58,812
Well good luck with that.

927
01:23:00,013 --> 01:23:01,680
- What else did Taylor tell you
about me?

928
01:23:01,682 --> 01:23:03,150
'Cause he didn't mention you.

929
01:23:06,053 --> 01:23:08,520
- Let me give you some
free advice, sweetie.

930
01:23:08,522 --> 01:23:09,721
Don't get too attached.

931
01:23:09,723 --> 01:23:12,123
He's not the nesting type.

932
01:23:12,125 --> 01:23:15,060
We were together for about
a year before he moved on

933
01:23:15,062 --> 01:23:18,632
and well, sooner or later
he'll get bored with you too.

934
01:23:42,255 --> 01:23:43,589
- Fuck.

935
01:24:24,431 --> 01:24:25,330
- I can't believe

936
01:24:25,332 --> 01:24:27,265
you're bringing that up right
now.

937
01:24:27,267 --> 01:24:28,534
- You could have at
least called.

938
01:24:28,536 --> 01:24:30,101
- It was a year ago, okay.

939
01:24:30,103 --> 01:24:33,138
- It was a year.
- Just get over it.

940
01:24:33,140 --> 01:24:33,974
Move on.

941
01:24:36,243 --> 01:24:37,077
Oh my God.

942
01:24:37,911 --> 01:24:38,746
Are you okay?

943
01:24:40,280 --> 01:24:41,281
How are you feeling?

944
01:24:42,950 --> 01:24:43,784
Easy, easy.

945
01:24:45,152 --> 01:24:47,118
You passed out.

946
01:24:47,120 --> 01:24:49,222
We found you in the woods.

947
01:24:50,290 --> 01:24:51,725
You must have fainted.

948
01:24:52,926 --> 01:24:53,759
I don't know.

949
01:24:53,761 --> 01:24:54,728
- I went for a walk

950
01:24:57,230 --> 01:24:58,065
then I saw it.

951
01:24:59,767 --> 01:25:01,099
Taylor, I saw it.

952
01:25:01,101 --> 01:25:02,603
- It's okay, you're okay.

953
01:25:03,637 --> 01:25:04,938
- It was just like before.

954
01:25:05,973 --> 01:25:07,975
I heard the sound, that sound

955
01:25:10,143 --> 01:25:10,976
and then I saw it.

956
01:25:10,978 --> 01:25:12,844
The same thing I saw yesterday.

957
01:25:12,846 --> 01:25:17,883
It was like a circle of light.

958
01:25:17,885 --> 01:25:22,287
And only now I could see it more

959
01:25:22,289 --> 01:25:24,489
and then I could feel it too.

960
01:25:24,491 --> 01:25:26,324
I could feel the heat coming
from it.

961
01:25:26,326 --> 01:25:30,195
- Yeah, you must have
hallucinated and passed out.

962
01:25:30,197 --> 01:25:33,331
It's gotta be 90 degrees
outside.

963
01:25:33,333 --> 01:25:34,365
- No.

964
01:25:34,367 --> 01:25:36,167
- Thank God I got back when I
did it.

965
01:25:36,169 --> 01:25:38,706
- It was not a hallucination.

966
01:25:47,347 --> 01:25:49,214
- Maybe they don't have
cell towers around here.

967
01:25:49,216 --> 01:25:50,381
But what I don't get

968
01:25:50,383 --> 01:25:52,886
is why the convenience store was
closed.

969
01:25:53,721 --> 01:25:56,323
I mean, it's Tuesday
afternoon, they should be open.

970
01:25:59,693 --> 01:26:02,828
Alexis is right though,
it's fucking hot in here.

971
01:26:02,830 --> 01:26:05,432
- So let's take a few things
off.

972
01:26:09,670 --> 01:26:12,540
- Well that wasn't
exactly what I meant, but.

973
01:26:21,649 --> 01:26:23,481
It's so fucked up.

974
01:26:23,483 --> 01:26:27,154
It's after 9:00 p.m. and
it's still bright as day.

975
01:26:31,191 --> 01:26:32,457
- What's wrong?

976
01:26:32,459 --> 01:26:33,293
- Nothing.

977
01:26:34,595 --> 01:26:35,629
Are you feeling okay?

978
01:26:36,463 --> 01:26:39,130
- Yeah. I know it sounds
weird, but I feel better now

979
01:26:39,132 --> 01:26:40,300
than I did this morning.

980
01:26:41,969 --> 01:26:44,335
- Well I'm happy for you,

981
01:26:44,337 --> 01:26:46,306
but I'm exhausted.

982
01:26:48,842 --> 01:26:49,677
Goodnight.

983
01:27:17,504 --> 01:27:19,106
Are you sure you wanna do this?

984
01:27:20,273 --> 01:27:24,277
- There's no phone, no internet,
we're running out of food.

985
01:27:25,513 --> 01:27:27,445
And we're not just cut
off from the movie Taylor,

986
01:27:27,447 --> 01:27:28,614
we're cut off from the world.

987
01:27:28,616 --> 01:27:29,981
- I understand, but I don't
think

988
01:27:29,983 --> 01:27:31,685
it's safe to drive right now
okay.

989
01:27:34,321 --> 01:27:35,754
Where's your car anyway?

990
01:27:35,756 --> 01:27:36,588
- It's just up the road.

991
01:27:36,590 --> 01:27:38,456
And I can't sleep here.

992
01:27:38,458 --> 01:27:40,427
How can anybody with all this
light?

993
01:27:41,595 --> 01:27:43,762
Every day it gets hotter and
brighter.

994
01:27:43,764 --> 01:27:46,264
And if I stay here one
more hour, I'm gonna melt.

995
01:27:46,266 --> 01:27:47,801
- You're being dramatic.

996
01:27:49,136 --> 01:27:51,770
- Have you looked at yourself,
man?

997
01:27:51,772 --> 01:27:53,641
How much sleep did you get last
night?

998
01:27:54,808 --> 01:27:56,644
This is fucked up and you know
it.

999
01:27:59,513 --> 01:28:01,348
Are you sure you don't wanna
come with me?

1000
01:28:31,579 --> 01:28:33,545
- I tried to convince her to
stay

1001
01:28:33,547 --> 01:28:36,717
but that's how she is, stubborn.

1002
01:28:40,821 --> 01:28:41,755
Maybe she's right.

1003
01:28:48,128 --> 01:28:49,227
What's this?

1004
01:28:49,229 --> 01:28:50,529
- Breakfast.

1005
01:28:50,531 --> 01:28:51,398
That's all we have.

1006
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:54,733
- You're not having anything?

1007
01:28:54,735 --> 01:28:55,636
- I'm not hungry.

1008
01:28:58,772 --> 01:28:59,607
It's better now.

1009
01:29:02,175 --> 01:29:03,474
- What's better?

1010
01:29:03,476 --> 01:29:04,612
- Now that she's gone?

1011
01:29:14,755 --> 01:29:18,056
- I'm sorry I didn't mention it
earlier.

1012
01:29:18,058 --> 01:29:22,193
Alexis and I, it was a long time
ago.

1013
01:29:22,195 --> 01:29:23,030
- I know.

1014
01:29:26,366 --> 01:29:28,466
- If you want to talk about it.

1015
01:29:28,468 --> 01:29:29,537
- Not really.

1016
01:32:10,864 --> 01:32:12,132
- Laura, Laura.

1017
01:32:13,100 --> 01:32:14,666
Laura.

1018
01:32:14,668 --> 01:32:15,836
Laura, please.

1019
01:32:16,804 --> 01:32:18,469
Please help me.

1020
01:32:18,471 --> 01:32:20,038
Please Laura.

1021
01:32:20,040 --> 01:32:21,840
Please help me.

1022
01:32:35,856 --> 01:32:37,525
Oh, I can't go home.

1023
01:32:42,730 --> 01:32:47,533
It was so bright, I couldn't
even see the road anymore.

1024
01:32:47,535 --> 01:32:49,402
And I wanted to stop but I
couldn't.

1025
01:32:50,538 --> 01:32:52,039
I had to keep going.

1026
01:32:53,040 --> 01:32:55,541
I felt like if I could
just stay on the road,

1027
01:32:55,543 --> 01:32:56,577
I could get away.

1028
01:33:00,447 --> 01:33:01,882
Is there any wine left?

1029
01:33:02,783 --> 01:33:03,617
- Yeah.

1030
01:33:08,288 --> 01:33:11,422
- So I kept driving
until, as far as I could

1031
01:33:11,424 --> 01:33:12,758
and the road ended

1032
01:33:12,760 --> 01:33:14,660
so I had to.
- What do you mean ended?

1033
01:33:14,662 --> 01:33:16,795
- It ended Taylor, there was
nothing.

1034
01:33:16,797 --> 01:33:18,431
It was the end of everything.

1035
01:33:20,500 --> 01:33:21,334
Oh, thank you.

1036
01:33:26,974 --> 01:33:29,943
- There is no end, only
beginnings.

1037
01:33:37,518 --> 01:33:40,318
- And the heat, the heat was
unbearable.

1038
01:33:40,320 --> 01:33:42,020
I felt like I was burning alive

1039
01:33:42,022 --> 01:33:44,255
and I was just sitting there.

1040
01:33:44,257 --> 01:33:48,093
And then I don't know how
but the car flamed up,

1041
01:33:48,095 --> 01:33:50,829
it just, it was literally in
flames.

1042
01:33:50,831 --> 01:33:53,932
And then I had to get out
of there, I had to get away.

1043
01:33:53,934 --> 01:33:57,335
And there was ash, there
was ash in the sky,

1044
01:33:57,337 --> 01:33:59,170
it was coming down like rain.

1045
01:33:59,172 --> 01:34:04,177
And that light that burned
your eyes, it was everywhere.

1046
01:34:06,647 --> 01:34:09,216
And I couldn't see where I was
going.

1047
01:34:10,417 --> 01:34:12,720
There's nowhere to go but back
here.

1048
01:34:14,321 --> 01:34:16,890
Taylor, what is happening,
what are we gonna do?

1049
01:35:41,909 --> 01:35:46,246
- Fuck is wrong with this thing?

1050
01:35:52,452 --> 01:35:54,986
What are you looking at?

1051
01:37:59,580 --> 01:38:00,413
- Laura.

1052
01:38:04,351 --> 01:38:05,152
Alexis.

1053
01:38:10,758 --> 01:38:12,225
I didn't know you were awake.

1054
01:38:14,227 --> 01:38:15,062
- Couldn't sleep.

1055
01:38:17,898 --> 01:38:18,699
- Me neither.

1056
01:38:21,368 --> 01:38:23,370
- It feels like I haven't slept
in days.

1057
01:38:25,272 --> 01:38:27,340
I don't even know what day it is
anymore.

1058
01:38:28,475 --> 01:38:29,510
Have you seen Alexis?

1059
01:38:36,349 --> 01:38:38,016
I've been thinking about this
situation

1060
01:38:38,018 --> 01:38:41,152
and I think we've been
making a big mistake.

1061
01:38:41,154 --> 01:38:44,255
We keep going down the
mountain to look for help,

1062
01:38:44,257 --> 01:38:45,659
but we should be going up.

1063
01:38:46,660 --> 01:38:47,626
- Up?

1064
01:38:47,628 --> 01:38:51,630
- Yeah, I mean we can't stay
here, Laura.

1065
01:38:51,632 --> 01:38:55,634
The fire or whatever it is,
it's getting closer every day.

1066
01:38:55,636 --> 01:38:57,603
Can't you feel it?

1067
01:38:57,605 --> 01:39:00,305
It's an oven out here.

1068
01:39:00,307 --> 01:39:03,975
But if we get to higher ground,

1069
01:39:03,977 --> 01:39:06,179
it'll be cooler at the top, it
has to be.

1070
01:39:10,050 --> 01:39:11,184
It's our only chance.

1071
01:39:14,421 --> 01:39:15,689
I'm gonna start packing.

1072
01:39:24,665 --> 01:39:27,165
- Alexis, we have to go.

1073
01:39:28,068 --> 01:39:29,036
Open up.

1074
01:39:32,372 --> 01:39:33,404
I've got a plan.

1075
01:39:34,241 --> 01:39:35,073
Alex.

1076
01:39:45,919 --> 01:39:46,754
No.

1077
01:39:49,823 --> 01:39:51,122
No.

1078
01:39:55,028 --> 01:39:55,863
No.

1079
01:40:12,680 --> 01:40:16,016
- She's dead, she killed
herself, Laura.

1080
01:40:18,351 --> 01:40:21,789
We have to go now before it's
too late.

1081
01:40:23,456 --> 01:40:26,424
- If that's what you want.

1082
01:40:26,426 --> 01:40:28,827
- What the hell is that supposed
to mean?

1083
01:40:28,829 --> 01:40:30,063
We can't stay here.

1084
01:40:31,298 --> 01:40:32,132
- Why not?

1085
01:40:33,100 --> 01:40:34,900
- What's wrong with you?

1086
01:40:34,902 --> 01:40:36,269
- Nothing's wrong with me.

1087
01:40:37,470 --> 01:40:38,471
- You're crazy.

1088
01:40:39,339 --> 01:40:42,309
This place is driving us all
crazy.

1089
01:40:44,344 --> 01:40:47,646
- I need to stay, this is good
for me.

1090
01:40:47,648 --> 01:40:50,215
- How could this be good for
you?

1091
01:40:50,217 --> 01:40:52,450
How could this be good for
anyone?

1092
01:40:52,452 --> 01:40:54,385
Do you wanna die too?

1093
01:40:54,387 --> 01:40:56,955
- Please understand, Taylor,
please.

1094
01:40:56,957 --> 01:40:59,124
- No, we're leaving.

1095
01:41:25,619 --> 01:41:26,654
Time to go now.

1096
01:41:28,922 --> 01:41:29,955
- Right.

1097
01:41:29,957 --> 01:41:31,890
It is time.

1098
01:41:31,892 --> 01:41:35,393
- Please Laura, stop with
the games, we have to leave.

1099
01:41:35,395 --> 01:41:36,396
- You should go.

1100
01:41:37,230 --> 01:41:39,264
They don't want you anyway.

1101
01:41:39,266 --> 01:41:42,235
- What the fuck are you talking
about.

1102
01:41:48,075 --> 01:41:48,809
Laura.

1103
01:42:05,425 --> 01:42:06,827
Come on, we have to go.

1104
01:46:53,747 --> 01:46:55,916
- Natalie.

1105
01:46:57,818 --> 01:46:59,150
- Stop it.

1106
01:46:59,152 --> 01:47:02,588
- Not until
you give me what I asked for.

1107
01:47:02,590 --> 01:47:05,891
- I gave you the stories,
what more do you want?

1108
01:47:05,893 --> 01:47:07,795
- You know what
I want?

1109
01:47:09,830 --> 01:47:13,331
I asked you to show me your
greatest fear.

1110
01:47:13,333 --> 01:47:15,466
- I'm not listening to you.

1111
01:47:18,972 --> 01:47:20,808
- Show me your
fear.

1112
01:47:25,178 --> 01:47:26,814
Your greatest fear.

1113
01:47:36,189 --> 01:47:38,491
Your greatest fear, Natalie.

1114
01:48:02,215 --> 01:48:04,683
- It's you.

1115
01:49:08,816 --> 01:49:10,816
- Authorities are
still searching for illustrator

1116
01:49:10,818 --> 01:49:12,250
and writer, Natalie Chase,

1117
01:49:12,252 --> 01:49:15,220
creator of bestselling
comic book, "Hi-Fear."

1118
01:49:15,222 --> 01:49:17,789
Reports have surfaced of Chase
suffering from hypochondria

1119
01:49:17,791 --> 01:49:20,125
and undergoing anti-aging
treatments.

1120
01:49:20,127 --> 01:49:22,427
But according to her
publisher, Barry Novak,

1121
01:49:22,429 --> 01:49:25,697
Chase is in perfect health at
the time of her disappearance.

1122
01:49:25,699 --> 01:49:27,866
"Hi-Fear" continues to
rack up record sales

1123
01:49:27,868 --> 01:49:30,237
for Nightfall Comics,
who recently announced

1124
01:49:31,038 --> 01:49:32,303
the movie deal is now in the
works.

1125
01:49:32,305 --> 01:49:35,941
We can only imagine how
scary that's going to be.

1126
01:49:37,444 --> 01:49:40,311
- What's
your greatest fear.

1127
01:54:14,354 --> 01:54:16,622
- Just like my mother
used to play an organ.

1128
01:54:16,624 --> 01:54:18,757
Jesus spoke to me and told me

1129
01:54:18,759 --> 01:54:21,860
that I had to raise a
quarter of a million dollars

1130
01:54:21,862 --> 01:54:24,632
or else my life was gonna end.

1131
01:54:27,300 --> 01:54:31,271
To demonstrate, we have a
timer here, with this dynamite.

1132
01:54:32,405 --> 01:54:35,674
If you don't start calling
in and making your donations,

1133
01:54:35,676 --> 01:54:36,775
who knows it could blow up

1134
01:54:36,777 --> 01:54:38,844
and that could be the
end of Cove Ministries.

1135
01:54:38,846 --> 01:54:41,346
And we all don't want
that, nobody wants that.

1136
01:54:41,348 --> 01:54:42,315
I don't believe so.

1137
01:54:44,017 --> 01:54:45,886
Well, again, just give what you
can.

1138
01:54:47,020 --> 01:54:51,356
The big message here is
that you have to help me.

1139
01:54:51,358 --> 01:54:53,358
Jesus wants to call me home.

1140
01:54:53,360 --> 01:54:55,694
I want to go home, but
I'm not ready quite yet.

1141
01:54:55,696 --> 01:54:59,164
Your donations, they can
make a difference here.

1142
01:54:59,166 --> 01:55:00,233
Give what you can.

1143
01:55:01,468 --> 01:55:05,704
Kids at home, if you got a
piggy bank laying around there,

1144
01:55:05,706 --> 01:55:08,106
go ahead and grab that
crack that thing open.

1145
01:55:08,108 --> 01:55:10,776
You don't need those old
devil worship and music tapes.

1146
01:55:10,778 --> 01:55:13,111
You don't need the video
games with all the violence

1147
01:55:13,113 --> 01:55:15,514
and all that horrible stuff.

1148
01:55:15,516 --> 01:55:17,616
Send your money to me, keep me
alive.
