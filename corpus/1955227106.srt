*
WOMAN: At the tone,
the time will be...

2
00:00:08,476 --> 00:00:10,878
KEITH OLBERMANN:
From the Warner Theatre...

3
00:00:10,978 --> 00:00:13,414
[Audience cheering]

4
00:00:13,514 --> 00:00:15,716
In Washington,

5
00:00:15,816 --> 00:00:20,388
It's "Bill Maher,
Live from D.C."

6
00:00:20,488 --> 00:00:21,922
[Applause]

7
00:00:30,998 --> 00:00:33,067
And hello again, everyone.
I'm Keith Olbermann,

8
00:00:33,167 --> 00:00:35,903
Reporting live from
up here in the balcony.

9
00:00:36,003 --> 00:00:38,406
And I am Michael Moore.
Welcome, everyone.

10
00:00:38,506 --> 00:00:40,774
Moments ago...
How's it going?

11
00:00:42,343 --> 00:00:44,578
Moments ago, Bill Maher
finished the first part

12
00:00:44,678 --> 00:00:46,247
Of this marathon,

13
00:00:46,347 --> 00:00:48,749
His first part
of his Lollapalooza here

14
00:00:48,849 --> 00:00:50,751
With the completion
of the first part

15
00:00:50,851 --> 00:00:53,254
Of the two-hour live,
live extravaganza, Michael.

16
00:00:53,354 --> 00:00:55,256
Yes, and we're going
to follow Bill for

17
00:00:55,356 --> 00:00:57,591
The next 5 minutes,
hopefully only
5 minutes.

18
00:00:57,691 --> 00:00:59,927
He's over
in Chinatown,
across town here,

19
00:01:00,027 --> 00:01:02,863
And he's getting
in his dressing room
right now.

20
00:01:02,963 --> 00:01:04,865
He's going
to change clothes,

21
00:01:04,965 --> 00:01:07,535
Getting into some
more casual clothes
for his standup.

22
00:01:07,635 --> 00:01:10,037
Has he gone into
the room yet there?
The door is closed.

23
00:01:10,138 --> 00:01:11,539
Bill is in there
right now.

24
00:01:11,639 --> 00:01:12,706
The door is...
Bill is in there.

25
00:01:12,806 --> 00:01:13,874
He's in there
right now.

26
00:01:13,974 --> 00:01:15,209
The door is
always closed, I know,

27
00:01:15,309 --> 00:01:17,044
From Bill's rules.

28
00:01:17,145 --> 00:01:18,546
Well, having been on
the show a few times,

29
00:01:18,646 --> 00:01:20,047
I can tell you what he's
doing right now.

30
00:01:20,148 --> 00:01:21,382
Well, tell me what he's
doing right now, Michael.

31
00:01:21,482 --> 00:01:23,384
He's lathering

32
00:01:23,484 --> 00:01:25,719
And then rinsing
and then repeating,

33
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:27,721
And then lathering
and rinsing

34
00:01:27,821 --> 00:01:29,056
And repeating again.

35
00:01:29,157 --> 00:01:31,058
He is a very clean
individual.

36
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:33,227
What part of the body
are you talking about,
Michael?

37
00:01:33,327 --> 00:01:35,896
Well, his... well, listen,
all I can hope for is

38
00:01:35,996 --> 00:01:38,232
That there's
a surveillance camera
in there, so that we can

39
00:01:38,332 --> 00:01:41,235
Turn the tape over
to Commissioner Goodell
after the show.

40
00:01:41,335 --> 00:01:43,771
[Cheering and applause]

41
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,243
Or not,
as the case may be.

42
00:01:49,343 --> 00:01:53,747
The moments of preparation
that are going into it...

43
00:01:53,847 --> 00:01:55,749
We're seeing something
unprecedented

44
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:58,419
In comedy tonight,
Michael. We're seeing
a man trying to be funny

45
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:01,755
For an hour in one theater,
and then stopping the funny,

46
00:02:01,855 --> 00:02:04,858
Then getting into a car
with a motorcade,

47
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:07,928
Going through Washington,
and then trying to resume
being funny later on.

48
00:02:08,028 --> 00:02:09,930
This has not been
attempted, we believe,

49
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,932
Since, uh, what was it?

50
00:02:12,032 --> 00:02:13,434
It was
Archduke Ferdinand...

51
00:02:13,534 --> 00:02:14,935
In Sarajevo in 1932.
Yes, yes.

52
00:02:15,035 --> 00:02:18,272
And then repeated again
for 8 years during

53
00:02:18,372 --> 00:02:21,108
The George W. Bush
administration
here, so...

54
00:02:21,209 --> 00:02:23,944
You know, he's still
in the room. Keith,
he's still in the room.

55
00:02:24,044 --> 00:02:25,946
I don't know what's
going on there.

56
00:02:26,046 --> 00:02:27,915
What is the penalty
for delay... oh,
here we comes!

57
00:02:28,015 --> 00:02:29,450
And he's out of the room.
Here he comes out.

58
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,419
He's all dressed.
He's ready to go.
He's on his way!

59
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,687
He's on his way to
the Warner Theatre here!

60
00:02:33,787 --> 00:02:36,857
All right. Look at him!
Man, and he is fit!
Look at that man go.

61
00:02:36,957 --> 00:02:38,859
And they're not
gonna get him...

62
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,363
Wait, wait, Keith.
I think he got dressed
a little too quickly.

63
00:02:42,463 --> 00:02:45,366
It does not look
like Bill is wearing
his protective cup.

64
00:02:45,466 --> 00:02:47,368
[Audience laughter]

65
00:02:47,468 --> 00:02:49,870
Well, I hope nobody
was looking for that,
by the way, Michael.

66
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:52,373
But he's off.
Here comes the motorcade.

67
00:02:52,473 --> 00:02:54,375
That's right, more...
Look at this!

68
00:02:54,475 --> 00:02:57,245
He's got
a police... he's got
a police escort!

69
00:02:57,345 --> 00:02:59,547
Look at this!
How does...

70
00:02:59,647 --> 00:03:02,483
You know,
normal politicians
of this town,

71
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:04,952
They have to just
settle for, like,
regular escorts.

72
00:03:05,052 --> 00:03:08,155
Mm-hmm.
This guy has got
a police escort.

73
00:03:08,256 --> 00:03:10,958
Clearly, the million
dollars he gave

74
00:03:11,058 --> 00:03:13,961
To Barack Obama has
paid off here tonight.

75
00:03:14,061 --> 00:03:17,798
Nobody can travel
through Washington,
D.C., this fast.

76
00:03:17,898 --> 00:03:19,132
Look at this.

77
00:03:19,233 --> 00:03:22,636
This is, once again,
your tax dollars in action.

78
00:03:22,736 --> 00:03:24,137
[Laughter]

79
00:03:24,238 --> 00:03:26,974
This is just amazing.
Wait a minute.

80
00:03:27,074 --> 00:03:30,711
Are those real cops
or are those actors
that have been hired?

81
00:03:30,811 --> 00:03:33,647
I think I see an HBO logo
where it should say "Police."

82
00:03:33,747 --> 00:03:34,982
Yeah. Heh!

83
00:03:35,082 --> 00:03:37,318
Well, they are the same
thing in this jurisdiction,

84
00:03:37,418 --> 00:03:39,152
HBO and the police
department.

85
00:03:39,253 --> 00:03:40,654
They're coming up to
the National Gallery

86
00:03:40,754 --> 00:03:42,490
There, folks, if you
know Washington, D.C.,

87
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:43,991
The beautiful
National Gallery

88
00:03:44,091 --> 00:03:45,993
With all of our
fine art works.

89
00:03:46,093 --> 00:03:47,995
[Applause]

90
00:03:48,095 --> 00:03:50,498
The route... we should
mention this, Michael...

91
00:03:50,598 --> 00:03:52,833
They're headed down
towards this, uh,

92
00:03:52,933 --> 00:03:55,002
What's it called again?
Pencil...

93
00:03:55,102 --> 00:03:57,204
He's gonna go to... yeah,
they're on Pennsylvania
Avenue right now.

94
00:03:57,305 --> 00:03:59,206
There will be
a turn there.
Yes.

95
00:03:59,307 --> 00:04:01,208
I think he's
going to go right.
If he goes left,

96
00:04:01,309 --> 00:04:03,243
We're going to have
about an hour
and a half to fill.

97
00:04:03,344 --> 00:04:04,745
[Laughter]

98
00:04:04,845 --> 00:04:06,747
I just got word from
the control room

99
00:04:06,847 --> 00:04:09,417
That Haley Barbour
has just killed a man

100
00:04:09,517 --> 00:04:11,585
Backstage just
to watch him die.

101
00:04:11,685 --> 00:04:13,086
[Laughter]

102
00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:15,856
We cannot confirm this
yet, but, uh,

103
00:04:15,956 --> 00:04:18,426
But actually,
before the show,
we did see...

104
00:04:18,526 --> 00:04:19,760
The people didn't
see this on the air...

105
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:22,763
But Nancy Pelosi
was tackled by
Jerry Seinfeld.

106
00:04:22,863 --> 00:04:23,931
Yeah.

107
00:04:24,031 --> 00:04:25,599
It was pretty gruesome.

108
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:27,768
Well, to get back
to what we see...

109
00:04:27,868 --> 00:04:29,437
Oh, here we go now.
Here they come.

110
00:04:29,537 --> 00:04:30,771
There's our Capitol!
That's it.

111
00:04:30,871 --> 00:04:32,573
I know that building.
It's open.

112
00:04:32,673 --> 00:04:34,742
They, uh, they don't...
They only have the...

113
00:04:34,842 --> 00:04:36,910
That's the wax
museum, right?
They never close down.

114
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:39,246
The... the turn
they made...

115
00:04:39,347 --> 00:04:40,414
There's a Popeyes
there now.

116
00:04:40,514 --> 00:04:41,749
They got a Popeyes
in the basement.

117
00:04:41,849 --> 00:04:43,917
They want past the new...

118
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:45,419
How would you know
about the...

119
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:47,588
They went past the...
How would we know?

120
00:04:47,688 --> 00:04:49,590
They went past the Newseum,
which, of course, is

121
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:51,592
The newest monument
in Washington to...

122
00:04:51,692 --> 00:04:54,595
Back in that time
when we used to have news.

123
00:04:54,695 --> 00:04:56,597
Yes, I remember that.

124
00:04:56,697 --> 00:04:59,099
That, uh, they're
on their way.

125
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,768
Here they come now.

126
00:05:00,868 --> 00:05:02,503
Now, they're on
Pennsylvania Avenue,

127
00:05:02,603 --> 00:05:05,005
Actually heading
toward the White House,
which... we're down near

128
00:05:05,105 --> 00:05:07,341
The White House,
and by the way, Keith,

129
00:05:07,441 --> 00:05:09,343
This is the 200th
anniversary this month

130
00:05:09,443 --> 00:05:11,845
Of the British
burning down
the White House.

131
00:05:11,945 --> 00:05:14,014
Little-known fact...

132
00:05:14,114 --> 00:05:16,850
They asked their
Canadian regiment
of the British Army

133
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,852
To do the burning
of the White House.

134
00:05:18,952 --> 00:05:22,189
The Canadians,
being, of course, great
comedians forever...

135
00:05:22,289 --> 00:05:25,192
True story... they went
across the Potomac
into Virginia,

136
00:05:25,292 --> 00:05:27,528
Freed some slaves,
and asked them
if they would like

137
00:05:27,628 --> 00:05:29,530
To do the honors
of striking the match,

138
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:31,699
And that's exactly
what happened.

139
00:05:31,799 --> 00:05:33,701
And now we've lost
the signal... there we go.

140
00:05:33,801 --> 00:05:35,035
Now we're back.
We're back on.

141
00:05:35,135 --> 00:05:37,037
Oh, there he is.
There's Bill.
Where?

142
00:05:37,137 --> 00:05:38,539
Where is he?
Oh, well... he may be

143
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,040
On one of the motorcycles.
What is he...

144
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:42,042
They're going by the
FBI Building right now.

145
00:05:42,142 --> 00:05:43,544
The J. Edgar Hoover.
Oh, dear.

146
00:05:43,644 --> 00:05:45,045
Wait a minute.
Oh, no, wait a minute.

147
00:05:45,145 --> 00:05:46,547
Oh, no!
What's going on
in the street?

148
00:05:46,647 --> 00:05:49,049
There's a Boy Scout
helping an old lady
across the street!

149
00:05:49,149 --> 00:05:52,052
Oh, no! We've got to get
this show started!

150
00:05:52,152 --> 00:05:54,054
They've stopped
the motorcade!

151
00:05:54,154 --> 00:05:57,057
The motorcade is stopped.
The old lady seems
to be terrified.

152
00:05:57,157 --> 00:06:00,561
What is she ter...
she sees some smoke
coming out of a crack

153
00:06:00,661 --> 00:06:03,063
In the window
from the back seat.

154
00:06:03,163 --> 00:06:05,065
Tell her not to worry.

155
00:06:05,165 --> 00:06:07,067
All right,
we're going to...

156
00:06:07,167 --> 00:06:09,236
I don't know what we're
going to do about this.
What's our plan here?

157
00:06:09,336 --> 00:06:11,905
Have you ever done
standup before?
No. I... I've...

158
00:06:12,005 --> 00:06:13,907
This is... we're live
right now on HBO.

159
00:06:14,007 --> 00:06:15,409
And this is...
Wait, wait, wait!

160
00:06:15,509 --> 00:06:16,910
The car is opening.
Oh, no!

161
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:18,912
Bill is run...
He's left the car!

162
00:06:19,012 --> 00:06:22,616
He's left the car
and is running to
the Warner Theatre!

163
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:24,618
Look at this man go!

164
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:26,286
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

165
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,288
The humanity!

166
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,458
Look at... look at this!
Where'd he go?

167
00:06:30,558 --> 00:06:31,959
We've lost him!
Michael...

168
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:34,962
Here he is!
Bill Maher has gone rogue.

169
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:37,965
We're gonna have
to do the show, Keith.

170
00:06:38,065 --> 00:06:39,967
We've lost...
wait a minute.
There he is.

171
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:42,302
There, way in the back.
See him, everybody?

172
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:43,771
Here he comes!
There he is.

173
00:06:43,871 --> 00:06:45,439
Look at him go.
[Cheering and applause]

174
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:47,608
Look at the power
in those thighs.

175
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:51,111
Would you say
he's a bantamweight
or a featherweight?

176
00:06:51,211 --> 00:06:54,114
Actually, kind of a cross,
kind of a half-bantam, half...

177
00:06:54,214 --> 00:06:56,617
Sort of a phantomweight,
I would say.

178
00:06:56,717 --> 00:06:58,118
Look at... man,
this guy can run.

179
00:06:58,218 --> 00:06:59,620
He can move.
Oh, he's coming in!

180
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,121
He's getting ready to
come in the building here.

181
00:07:01,221 --> 00:07:02,490
Oh, my God.
Well...

182
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:05,158
Wait a minute! Are we
in trouble if ISIS is
watching this?

183
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:06,527
[Laughter]

184
00:07:06,627 --> 00:07:08,796
You know, actually,
Bill used to date
a woman named Isis,

185
00:07:08,896 --> 00:07:10,297
But we won't go
into that.
Well, yeah.

186
00:07:10,397 --> 00:07:12,299
All right, everyone,
here he comes!

187
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:14,968
Here he comes,
ladies and gentlemen!

188
00:07:15,068 --> 00:07:17,304
Oh, my God!
Take it over, Keith!

189
00:07:17,404 --> 00:07:18,806
[Cheering and applause]

190
00:07:18,906 --> 00:07:20,508
KEITH:
The final powdering.

191
00:07:20,608 --> 00:07:24,478
The insertion of some
extra-funny funny words

192
00:07:24,578 --> 00:07:25,979
That he's been using
exclusively, like "boobs."

193
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:27,481
MICHAEL: Look at this.

194
00:07:27,581 --> 00:07:29,517
BILL: There's water
up there, right?
Yeah.

195
00:07:29,617 --> 00:07:31,819
KEITH: A little water.
MICHAEL: They're
talking to him.

196
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:33,320
BILL: OK.
They're going to have
to cut his eye.

197
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:35,322
Giving him
the microphone.

198
00:07:35,422 --> 00:07:37,324
The moment is
nearly here, Michael.

199
00:07:37,424 --> 00:07:38,492
*
WOMAN: At the tone...

200
00:07:38,592 --> 00:07:39,493
MICHAEL: Here we go!

201
00:07:39,593 --> 00:07:41,495
KEITH: Ladies and gentlemen,

202
00:07:41,595 --> 00:07:46,667
Please welcome Bill Maher!

203
00:07:46,767 --> 00:07:48,502
[Cheering and applause]

204
00:07:48,602 --> 00:07:52,039
*

205
00:08:05,753 --> 00:08:07,688
Thank you.

206
00:08:16,263 --> 00:08:17,565
Thank you.

207
00:08:17,665 --> 00:08:19,567
Ay, ay, ay.

208
00:08:19,667 --> 00:08:21,802
That was a...

209
00:08:21,902 --> 00:08:24,271
[Cheering and applause]

210
00:08:25,906 --> 00:08:28,175
Thank you very much.

211
00:08:32,913 --> 00:08:34,815
There was an old lady
and a Boy Scout

212
00:08:34,915 --> 00:08:36,817
In the middle of the street.

213
00:08:36,917 --> 00:08:40,320
I had to run 3 blocks
at breakneck speed.

214
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:42,489
Oh, thank God I'm white.

215
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:44,024
[Laughter]

216
00:08:47,427 --> 00:08:49,797
Oh, but thank you. Heh!

217
00:08:49,897 --> 00:08:52,299
Thank you for hanging out here.

218
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:55,202
[Cheering and applause]

219
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:58,706
Now it's your turn.

220
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,175
Are you all Washingtonians,

221
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:04,678
Are you excited about what's
going on in this town?

222
00:09:04,778 --> 00:09:06,346
AUDIENCE: No!
Really?

223
00:09:06,446 --> 00:09:09,516
'Cause what's going on
in this town? Nothing.

224
00:09:09,617 --> 00:09:11,318
Now, in the country,
there's elections coming up.

225
00:09:11,418 --> 00:09:13,286
Are you going to vote
in the midterm elections?

226
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:14,454
[Cheering and applause]

227
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,456
Really? Wow.

228
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:17,958
See, the problem...
[Person yells]

229
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:21,294
What's that? The problem
is that the liberal base,

230
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:24,131
You know, doesn't show up
for the midterms.

231
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:25,633
Well, maybe you do.

232
00:09:25,733 --> 00:09:27,000
[Laughter]

233
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,669
But mostly they don't,
you know.

234
00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:30,938
Each party has their base.
You know this.

235
00:09:31,038 --> 00:09:32,439
Liberals have women,

236
00:09:32,539 --> 00:09:34,441
Minorities, younger people.

237
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:37,277
Conservatives have, uh...
[Person yells]

238
00:09:37,377 --> 00:09:38,779
Uh...

239
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:40,313
[Laughter]

240
00:09:42,883 --> 00:09:45,452
People who make sighing
noises when they get up.

241
00:09:45,552 --> 00:09:47,454
That's who they have.

242
00:09:47,554 --> 00:09:51,859
People buying gold
from Glenn Beck. That's...

243
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:55,528
Heh heh!
The Rascal scooter crowd.

244
00:09:55,629 --> 00:09:57,364
Here's a sad fact
about America.

245
00:09:57,464 --> 00:10:00,367
Do you know that most people
who have Rascal scooters

246
00:10:00,467 --> 00:10:02,535
Do not need them?

247
00:10:02,636 --> 00:10:04,872
They just hit 60 and went,

248
00:10:04,972 --> 00:10:07,374
"Fuck it, I'm done walking."

249
00:10:07,474 --> 00:10:09,910
It's true. Heh!

250
00:10:11,979 --> 00:10:14,214
And, of course, the other
reason why it's going to be

251
00:10:14,314 --> 00:10:16,549
Tough for the Democrats
is 'cause, as usual,

252
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:18,819
The Democrats are running away

253
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:20,821
From something good
that they did.

254
00:10:20,921 --> 00:10:23,490
[Person yells]
Now... let me finish.

255
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:25,492
[Laughter and applause]

256
00:10:25,592 --> 00:10:28,061
I ran 3 blocks.
Let me do it.

257
00:10:28,161 --> 00:10:29,362
[Cheering and applause]

258
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:30,898
[Bill chuckles]

259
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:39,372
No, they gave people
health care, which is
a good thing.

260
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,241
They should own it.

261
00:10:41,341 --> 00:10:44,077
[Cheering and applause]

262
00:10:44,177 --> 00:10:46,379
But Democrats always get
so intimidated

263
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:49,883
Whenever Republicans act
like drama queens,

264
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,419
Which, of course, is always.

265
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:54,387
Everything is always
the end of the universe.

266
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:57,925
They're always shitting
in their overalls that...

267
00:10:58,025 --> 00:11:02,529
President Blackenstein
has done something...

268
00:11:02,629 --> 00:11:04,898
Outrageous and unpresiden...

269
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:06,900
"He's declared himself a king!"

270
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,036
Oh, for fuck's sake.

271
00:11:09,136 --> 00:11:11,238
You know, he's using
executive action,

272
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:13,573
Which every president
has done, of course,

273
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,876
But when he does it,
oh, my God, he's Dracula

274
00:11:15,976 --> 00:11:18,779
Crossed with Hitler
times lung cancer.

275
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,753
Ted Cruz, the patient zero

276
00:11:25,853 --> 00:11:28,255
For the dysfunction
in this town.

277
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:30,257
[Cheering and applause]
I swear to God,

278
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:32,425
This year he said, uh,

279
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:34,094
"This year, Senate Democrats

280
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:36,596
"Will be voting on
a constitutional amendment

281
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,766
To repeal the First Amendment."

282
00:11:38,866 --> 00:11:41,902
[Laughter]
I know. Exactly.

283
00:11:42,002 --> 00:11:44,437
Really, Ted, no one
would vote on such a thing,

284
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:47,474
But listening to you
talk, it is tempting.

285
00:11:51,011 --> 00:11:54,414
Now, what is making
Right-wingers crazy these days

286
00:11:54,514 --> 00:11:57,417
Is that not only did America

287
00:11:57,517 --> 00:11:59,586
Elect a black president,

288
00:11:59,686 --> 00:12:02,923
It went ahead and re-elected
a black president.

289
00:12:03,023 --> 00:12:05,859
This is my little pet theory

290
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:08,528
About why they're crazy.

291
00:12:08,628 --> 00:12:10,764
I mean, the first time,
they didn't like it,

292
00:12:10,864 --> 00:12:13,834
But they were like,
"Well, everybody experiments."

293
00:12:15,535 --> 00:12:16,937
[Chuckles]

294
00:12:17,037 --> 00:12:18,939
Now they're like, "Oh, shit!"

295
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:21,674
What if that once-you-go-black
thing is true?"

296
00:12:23,543 --> 00:12:24,912
[Bill chuckles]

297
00:12:28,048 --> 00:12:30,250
"What if it turns out
the coloreds is good

298
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:32,285
At presidentin'?"

299
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:40,127
And I think the coloreds
is good at presidenting. I do.

300
00:12:40,227 --> 00:12:42,462
And I think I know why.
Because I think,

301
00:12:42,562 --> 00:12:44,464
When you grow up black
in America,

302
00:12:44,564 --> 00:12:46,466
You have to learn how
to be patient

303
00:12:46,566 --> 00:12:48,468
With stupid white people.

304
00:12:48,568 --> 00:12:49,803
[Cheering and applause]

305
00:12:49,903 --> 00:12:52,405
And, folks,

306
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:55,642
That is a lot
of what government is,

307
00:12:55,742 --> 00:12:57,310
No matter what color you are...

308
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:59,312
Being patient
with stupid white people.

309
00:12:59,412 --> 00:13:01,815
Do you ever see Obama
when he comes out of a meeting

310
00:13:01,915 --> 00:13:04,818
With Mitch McConnell and...

311
00:13:04,918 --> 00:13:06,519
John Boehner,

312
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:09,356
These mental giants
he has to work with?

313
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:14,027
And he always tries to put
a positive spin on it,

314
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:16,997
Praises them whenever
it's at all appropriate,

315
00:13:17,097 --> 00:13:21,201
He gently criticizes when it's
absolutely necessary.

316
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:24,371
It's like watching a really good
special-ed teacher.

317
00:13:25,939 --> 00:13:27,340
It is.

318
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,842
[Applause]

319
00:13:28,942 --> 00:13:30,543
Heh!

320
00:13:32,712 --> 00:13:37,617
Things are so bad
politization-wise in this town.

321
00:13:37,717 --> 00:13:40,553
Michelle Obama
this year came out...

322
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,956
I think just to test
the Republicans...

323
00:13:43,056 --> 00:13:47,060
Came out for drinking
more water...

324
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:50,397
Just to see if they would
come out against water...

325
00:13:50,497 --> 00:13:51,965
[Laughter]

326
00:13:52,065 --> 00:13:53,400
And they did.

327
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,403
Predictably, they did.

328
00:13:56,503 --> 00:13:58,638
I mean, we should
have seen this coming

329
00:13:58,738 --> 00:14:02,642
Because Michelle Obama's
First Lady project...

330
00:14:02,742 --> 00:14:04,811
You know, in America,
we don't elect women leaders,

331
00:14:04,912 --> 00:14:07,014
Like 80 other
countries have done.

332
00:14:07,114 --> 00:14:08,982
We have first ladies,
and we give 'em

333
00:14:09,082 --> 00:14:11,518
A little First Lady project.

334
00:14:13,086 --> 00:14:14,988
"What's your project,
First Lady?

335
00:14:15,088 --> 00:14:17,590
"Beautify America.
Isn't that wonderful, folks?

336
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,426
"She's going
to beautify America.

337
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:21,428
"Thank you, First Lady.
That's terrific.

338
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:23,463
"What about you, Laura B...?

339
00:14:23,563 --> 00:14:25,966
Oh, literacy."
Who could be against that?

340
00:14:26,066 --> 00:14:27,968
And right in this...
[Person yells]

341
00:14:28,068 --> 00:14:29,970
What?
Her husband!

342
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:32,139
[Laughter, cheering,
and applause]

343
00:14:32,239 --> 00:14:33,673
Ha ha!

344
00:14:41,748 --> 00:14:43,816
Right, I do this whole thing
in another show, but that's

345
00:14:43,917 --> 00:14:46,819
What you explode
in applause for.

346
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:49,156
And we wonder why we have
a bad government.

347
00:14:49,256 --> 00:14:51,058
Anyway...

348
00:14:51,158 --> 00:14:53,226
Um... heh heh!

349
00:14:53,326 --> 00:14:55,662
No, I mean,
that's what we do.

350
00:14:55,762 --> 00:14:58,331
We give the little project
to the First Lady because

351
00:14:58,431 --> 00:15:00,833
We pat them on the head,
and Michelle Obama picked

352
00:15:00,934 --> 00:15:02,936
Getting the kids
in better shape, which is

353
00:15:03,036 --> 00:15:06,439
Right in this tradition,
not controversial.

354
00:15:06,539 --> 00:15:08,942
Just saying, "Hey, kids",

355
00:15:09,042 --> 00:15:12,179
"Don't eat lard
for lunch every day and...

356
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:14,281
Get a little more exercise."

357
00:15:14,381 --> 00:15:16,283
Well, on the Right,
you would have thought

358
00:15:16,383 --> 00:15:18,818
She farted in Jesus' face.

359
00:15:21,888 --> 00:15:24,624
"Fuck you, black lady,
tellin' me how to raise my kids.

360
00:15:24,724 --> 00:15:27,694
Fuck you. That's my freedom
right there you're..."

361
00:15:30,063 --> 00:15:32,799
"I will raise a brood
of lethargic, poisoned blimps

362
00:15:32,899 --> 00:15:34,834
If I want to."

363
00:15:38,905 --> 00:15:42,642
"Those aren't our fat cells,
those are freedom cells, you..."

364
00:15:42,742 --> 00:15:45,645
It's always freedom
with these people...

365
00:15:45,745 --> 00:15:48,681
But, you know...

366
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,319
But I'm telling you,
it's not logical with them.

367
00:15:52,419 --> 00:15:55,155
What's blowing their minds is
that they got their ass kicked

368
00:15:55,255 --> 00:15:56,656
Twice!

369
00:15:56,756 --> 00:15:57,991
[Cheering and applause]

370
00:15:58,091 --> 00:16:00,060
Twice!

371
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,495
They were so upset about this

372
00:16:02,595 --> 00:16:04,497
That after the last one,

373
00:16:04,597 --> 00:16:06,499
They did an autopsy.

374
00:16:06,599 --> 00:16:08,501
Their word.
I'm not being snarky.

375
00:16:08,601 --> 00:16:10,670
That was their word... autopsy.

376
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:14,007
These are people who don't do
introspection a lot,

377
00:16:14,107 --> 00:16:16,009
But their minds were blown.

378
00:16:16,109 --> 00:16:18,078
They had to find out,
"How could we have lost twice

379
00:16:18,178 --> 00:16:20,080
To Cedric the Entertainer?"

380
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:21,614
[Laughter]

381
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:25,752
Heh!

382
00:16:25,852 --> 00:16:28,755
So they literally made a list
of things it could have been.

383
00:16:28,855 --> 00:16:32,525
One was, "Maybe our ideas suck."

384
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:35,262
No. They got rid of that,
like, in an hour.

385
00:16:35,362 --> 00:16:37,264
Before lunch,
they threw that one away.

386
00:16:37,364 --> 00:16:40,533
"Are you kidding? Our ideas
are fuckin' awesome."

387
00:16:40,633 --> 00:16:43,770
Who would not want to vote
for an agenda of protecting

388
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:47,707
Insurance companies
from sick children...

389
00:16:47,807 --> 00:16:52,279
Thinking up new places
to take a gun...

390
00:16:52,379 --> 00:16:55,115
And naming buildings
after Ronald Reagan?

391
00:16:55,215 --> 00:16:58,285
I mean, if that's not
the perfect prescription...

392
00:16:58,385 --> 00:17:00,287
OK, so it couldn't
have been that.

393
00:17:00,387 --> 00:17:02,289
So they went to the second thing
it might have been...

394
00:17:02,389 --> 00:17:04,291
"Maybe the last two times,

395
00:17:04,391 --> 00:17:06,826
We had flawed candidates."

396
00:17:08,395 --> 00:17:09,796
No. Oh, please.

397
00:17:09,896 --> 00:17:11,631
Mitt Romney
and John McCain, flawed?

398
00:17:11,731 --> 00:17:15,168
I think you're being way
too hard on yourself. I...

399
00:17:15,268 --> 00:17:18,105
OK, first,
the world's oldest man...

400
00:17:18,205 --> 00:17:19,639
[Laughter]

401
00:17:21,074 --> 00:17:23,976
Chooses the world's
stupidest woman.

402
00:17:24,077 --> 00:17:26,513
[Laughter, cheering,
and applause]

403
00:17:34,321 --> 00:17:37,724
And you're saying that's flawed?

404
00:17:37,824 --> 00:17:40,393
And then, Mitt Romney?

405
00:17:40,493 --> 00:17:43,062
I can't believe
I was so scared

406
00:17:43,163 --> 00:17:45,398
That Mitt Romney was
going to be president

407
00:17:45,498 --> 00:17:48,401
That a million dollars flew
right out of my pocket.

408
00:17:48,501 --> 00:17:51,904
What? What the hell
happened that day?

409
00:17:52,004 --> 00:17:53,406
[Cheering and applause]

410
00:17:53,506 --> 00:17:56,409
But... heh heh!...
Money well spent.

411
00:17:56,509 --> 00:17:59,746
I'll tell you something,
Mitt Romney, if nothing else,

412
00:17:59,846 --> 00:18:02,915
Taught me about Republicans,
because here's the thing

413
00:18:03,015 --> 00:18:04,584
You have to understand
about Republicans.

414
00:18:04,684 --> 00:18:06,253
They're not logical.

415
00:18:06,353 --> 00:18:08,755
It's all happening
in the gut with them.

416
00:18:08,855 --> 00:18:11,758
It is. I mean, logically
they don't exist.

417
00:18:11,858 --> 00:18:14,093
They're a crazy patchwork of

418
00:18:14,194 --> 00:18:16,763
Jesus freaks and gun nuts

419
00:18:16,863 --> 00:18:19,766
And generic,
obese suburbanites

420
00:18:19,866 --> 00:18:24,337
And the super-rich, but...

421
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:27,240
But what they all have
in common is this belief

422
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:29,242
That life in America
was perfect

423
00:18:29,342 --> 00:18:32,645
In Appleton, Wisconsin,
in 1958...

424
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:36,749
Before there were gay marriage

425
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:39,252
Or regulations or recycling

426
00:18:39,352 --> 00:18:42,255
Or certain types
of light bulbs you had to buy

427
00:18:42,355 --> 00:18:46,359
Or "Dora the Explorer" and...

428
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:48,195
And, you know, on that level,

429
00:18:48,295 --> 00:18:50,197
Mitt Romney is
the perfect candidate.

430
00:18:50,297 --> 00:18:52,199
That's the one thing
he's sincere about,

431
00:18:52,299 --> 00:18:54,201
The one thing that's
authentic about him.

432
00:18:54,301 --> 00:18:58,371
He is a 1950s sitcom dad.

433
00:18:58,471 --> 00:19:01,208
All Mormons are.
They're all...

434
00:19:01,308 --> 00:19:06,045
Even the women are
1950s sitcom dads.

435
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:10,317
Mitt Romney legitimately
eats meatloaf

436
00:19:10,417 --> 00:19:14,321
And he tells knock-knock jokes

437
00:19:14,421 --> 00:19:19,326
And he says "darn" and "dern"
when he's really pissed off,

438
00:19:19,426 --> 00:19:22,829
And he fucks the same woman
quietly in the dark

439
00:19:22,929 --> 00:19:25,832
Decade after decade.

440
00:19:25,932 --> 00:19:27,500
Why?

441
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,469
Because he loves freedom.

442
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:33,039
[Person yells]

443
00:19:33,139 --> 00:19:36,509
OK, stop yelling out.
I promise what I have is better.

444
00:19:36,609 --> 00:19:38,378
Stop.
[Cheering and applause]

445
00:19:38,478 --> 00:19:40,680
People are watching this
at home.

446
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,382
Ha ha ha!

447
00:19:45,452 --> 00:19:48,288
Now, these are the same people
who are always... you know,

448
00:19:48,388 --> 00:19:51,458
It's always about the freedom
and "I want my country back."

449
00:19:51,558 --> 00:19:53,025
"Country back"?

450
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:55,628
You know what, assholes?
I travel this country.

451
00:19:55,728 --> 00:19:57,196
Almost every weekend.

452
00:19:57,297 --> 00:20:00,132
I wish it had gone somewhere.

453
00:20:00,233 --> 00:20:02,134
It hasn't.

454
00:20:02,235 --> 00:20:04,637
I wish Obama had transformed it

455
00:20:04,737 --> 00:20:07,707
With his magic Kenyan wand,
but it's still

456
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:12,178
The same Kentucky-fried place
it ever has been.

457
00:20:13,746 --> 00:20:15,648
But I'm telling
you... drama queens,

458
00:20:15,748 --> 00:20:18,818
You know, during one
of the Obama scandals,

459
00:20:18,918 --> 00:20:23,055
One of the many scandals
that "A"... aren't scandals,

460
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:26,158
And "B"... Obama had about
as much to do with

461
00:20:26,259 --> 00:20:31,264
As Michele Bachmann had to do
with mapping the human genome...

462
00:20:34,834 --> 00:20:38,905
But... during the IRS scandal,

463
00:20:39,005 --> 00:20:42,742
A Republican Congressman said,
"Is this still America?"

464
00:20:42,842 --> 00:20:45,345
[Sighs dramatically]

465
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:48,247
Oh, it's always
a Mexican soap opera

466
00:20:48,348 --> 00:20:49,949
With these people.

467
00:20:50,049 --> 00:20:52,452
You know what? Yeah, I think
it is still America.

468
00:20:52,552 --> 00:20:56,122
I think when the IRS looks
a little more into groups

469
00:20:56,222 --> 00:21:00,126
With names like Fuck The IRS,

470
00:21:00,226 --> 00:21:02,061
It's still America.

471
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:07,133
But they love to make these
assertions backed up by nothing.

472
00:21:07,233 --> 00:21:09,135
They love to say,
for example,

473
00:21:09,235 --> 00:21:12,639
"Obama is the most radical
president we've ever had."

474
00:21:12,739 --> 00:21:16,208
'Cause, you know,
they're the ones
who know history so well.

475
00:21:16,309 --> 00:21:19,979
Michele Bachmann once said,
"Thank God for
the founding fathers,

476
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:23,516
Who worked tirelessly
until they eradicated slavery."

477
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,221
I was at the Lincoln
Memorial today.

478
00:21:29,322 --> 00:21:32,258
Nothing in there now.
Just it's...

479
00:21:33,826 --> 00:21:36,062
Rick Perry could not place

480
00:21:36,162 --> 00:21:38,565
The correct century

481
00:21:38,665 --> 00:21:41,067
For the American Revolution.

482
00:21:41,167 --> 00:21:43,235
He thought it happened
in the 1500s.

483
00:21:43,336 --> 00:21:45,237
Rick...

484
00:21:45,338 --> 00:21:47,740
Sweetheart, come on.

485
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,742
1776.

486
00:21:49,842 --> 00:21:52,412
There's a musical
by this name.

487
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:53,913
People sing it.

488
00:21:54,013 --> 00:21:57,950
Mexicans know this date.
Children know this date.

489
00:21:59,452 --> 00:22:04,357
Everybody knows, when Jesus sat
down to write the Constitution,

490
00:22:04,457 --> 00:22:07,560
It was in 1776.

491
00:22:09,128 --> 00:22:12,532
That's the year the British
stole the Wright brothers' plane

492
00:22:12,632 --> 00:22:15,034
And flew it
into Uncle Tom's cabin.

493
00:22:15,134 --> 00:22:17,537
We all know our history.

494
00:22:17,637 --> 00:22:19,038
[Chuckles]

495
00:22:19,138 --> 00:22:22,041
Not the 1500s. Fuck.

496
00:22:22,141 --> 00:22:26,045
That's when Washington
crossed the Danube...

497
00:22:26,145 --> 00:22:30,417
To blow up
that abortion clinic.

498
00:22:31,818 --> 00:22:35,121
No. No, I made
that part up, but...

499
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:38,591
Sarah Palin...

500
00:22:38,691 --> 00:22:41,127
[Audience groaning]

501
00:22:42,695 --> 00:22:44,931
Who's carrying my baby...

502
00:22:45,031 --> 00:22:46,933
[Cheering and laughter]

503
00:22:47,033 --> 00:22:49,969
Let me finish!

504
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:58,945
Sarah Palin once said
that Paul Revere made his ride

505
00:22:59,045 --> 00:23:02,014
To warn the British...

506
00:23:02,114 --> 00:23:03,883
She said this...

507
00:23:03,983 --> 00:23:06,719
About the Second Amendment
11 years before it was written,

508
00:23:06,819 --> 00:23:10,890
So I think when they say
he's the most radical president

509
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:13,225
We've ever had,
what they mean is

510
00:23:13,325 --> 00:23:15,562
He's black, OK?

511
00:23:15,662 --> 00:23:17,564
This is... this is the word

512
00:23:17,664 --> 00:23:19,566
That sticks in their throat.

513
00:23:19,666 --> 00:23:21,568
They are dying
to say it every minute!

514
00:23:21,668 --> 00:23:24,671
"He's black!
Does nobody see this?!"

515
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:28,975
"There's a black family eating
off the White House china,

516
00:23:29,075 --> 00:23:31,010
"And nobody... "

517
00:23:32,912 --> 00:23:34,981
But they can't say that,

518
00:23:35,081 --> 00:23:37,550
So they're always

519
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:40,487
Calling him a terrorist
or a communist

520
00:23:40,587 --> 00:23:43,490
Or an Afro-communist,
the loud tribesman,

521
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:45,492
And every euphemism.

522
00:23:45,592 --> 00:23:49,061
Newt Gingrich always calls him
"the food stamp president."

523
00:23:49,161 --> 00:23:51,998
Nothing racist there.
Wink, wink.

524
00:23:52,098 --> 00:23:55,167
"I'm just saying that when
the first black president
became president,

525
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:57,670
"All he wanted to do was
walk through the ghetto,
passing out food stamps.

526
00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:02,174
"I'm just say... nothing...
when he wasn't selling
crack, obviously,

527
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:05,344
Or throwing dice
behind the Dumpster
at Popeyes chicken."

528
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:08,380
Those are the goals he had,
but nothing racist.

529
00:24:09,949 --> 00:24:12,351
I mean, first of all,
can you imagine

530
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:15,387
Taking moral advice
from Newt Gingrich?

531
00:24:16,956 --> 00:24:19,859
A man who left his first wife
when she got cancer...

532
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:22,194
People know this...
Left his second wife

533
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:24,363
When she got MS,
and they write about that.

534
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:26,866
But I think
the deeper question is,

535
00:24:26,966 --> 00:24:30,269
How come, when
Newt Gingrich fucks you...

536
00:24:30,369 --> 00:24:32,772
[Laughter]

537
00:24:32,872 --> 00:24:34,774
You get very, very sick?

538
00:24:34,874 --> 00:24:39,011
I think we should look
into that first.

539
00:24:39,111 --> 00:24:41,047
[Cheering and applause]

540
00:24:42,615 --> 00:24:44,551
So you know what?

541
00:24:44,651 --> 00:24:48,387
They can deny all they want
that there's something
racial going on here,

542
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:51,390
But there is a kind of
"in your face" disrespect

543
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:54,894
For this president
I've never seen anywhere else.

544
00:24:54,994 --> 00:24:57,897
Heckling him at
the State of the Union.
[Applause]

545
00:24:57,997 --> 00:25:00,567
"You lie!"
Remember that guy?

546
00:25:00,667 --> 00:25:03,736
The governor of Arizona sticking
her finger in his face,

547
00:25:03,836 --> 00:25:06,405
Bill O'Reilly interrupting him
every two seconds.

548
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:08,407
People don't do that
to presidents.

549
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:10,910
There was a Republican
Congressman who said,

550
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:15,414
"I cannot stand to be in
the same room with him."

551
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:18,585
You know, they hated Clinton.
They didn't say that about him,

552
00:25:18,685 --> 00:25:20,787
And his come was
on the furniture.

553
00:25:22,789 --> 00:25:25,224
So I...

554
00:25:28,294 --> 00:25:31,698
I think there's something
racial going on,

555
00:25:31,798 --> 00:25:35,034
Which is not to say
that liberals can't be stupid

556
00:25:35,134 --> 00:25:38,037
About race, too, but
at least their stupidity

557
00:25:38,137 --> 00:25:40,039
Comes from niceness.

558
00:25:40,139 --> 00:25:42,041
You know, they're
too sensitive.

559
00:25:42,141 --> 00:25:44,043
I just say the word
"race," and I can feel

560
00:25:44,143 --> 00:25:47,213
The sphincters tightening...

561
00:25:47,313 --> 00:25:49,381
Which is silly!

562
00:25:49,481 --> 00:25:51,718
Like, if I say...
And I've said this before

563
00:25:51,818 --> 00:25:54,553
And I've gotten booed...
That I think tattoos

564
00:25:54,654 --> 00:25:57,056
Look stupid on black people.

565
00:25:57,156 --> 00:25:59,091
[Scattered applause]

566
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:02,561
Right. It's not racist.

567
00:26:02,662 --> 00:26:06,165
I just can't make out
what it is.

568
00:26:06,265 --> 00:26:09,068
I mean, "Is that a rose
or a baby's head on that?"

569
00:26:09,168 --> 00:26:11,070
I just can't..."

570
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:13,405
That's not racist,
and honestly,

571
00:26:13,505 --> 00:26:16,075
I don't think tattoos
look good on anybody.

572
00:26:16,175 --> 00:26:19,111
[Cheering and applause]
Especially...

573
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:23,582
Especially the ones in writing.

574
00:26:23,683 --> 00:26:25,251
Really?

575
00:26:25,351 --> 00:26:28,120
You couldn't just
remember that?

576
00:26:29,856 --> 00:26:32,759
"Only the strong survive."
Yeah, you know.

577
00:26:32,859 --> 00:26:35,527
A Post-It note on
the refrigerator.

578
00:26:35,628 --> 00:26:37,764
Is there anybody
walking around,

579
00:26:37,864 --> 00:26:40,266
"Oh, I wish I could remember

580
00:26:40,366 --> 00:26:43,803
What my philosophy of life is."

581
00:26:45,872 --> 00:26:48,274
"Oh, yeah, that's right.

582
00:26:48,374 --> 00:26:51,110
Thank you, arm!"
Ha ha ha!

583
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:53,579
"You really saved my ass!

584
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:56,215
"Say thank you to the ass.

585
00:26:56,315 --> 00:26:59,585
"Oh, look, I got one
back there, too.

586
00:26:59,686 --> 00:27:02,121
Oh, shit, it's in Chinese."

587
00:27:05,024 --> 00:27:08,928
I can't wait for the people
who have the Chinese symbol
to someday get that translated:

588
00:27:09,028 --> 00:27:13,632
"Enjoy the dog meat, whitey."
You know, that's what it
probably says.

589
00:27:17,704 --> 00:27:20,773
But I tell you something,
of all the racists I think

590
00:27:20,873 --> 00:27:23,442
In the Republican party,
you know who the worst one is?

591
00:27:23,542 --> 00:27:24,944
Donald Trump.

592
00:27:25,044 --> 00:27:26,445
Donald Trump.

593
00:27:26,545 --> 00:27:28,580
Yes, and I'll tell you why.

594
00:27:28,681 --> 00:27:29,916
[Cheering and applause]

595
00:27:30,016 --> 00:27:32,184
Donald Trump sued me last year

596
00:27:32,284 --> 00:27:34,020
For $5 million.

597
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:36,022
Do you know this?
Yes! 5...

598
00:27:36,122 --> 00:27:37,957
And here's how this came about.

599
00:27:38,057 --> 00:27:40,126
Donald Tru... heh heh!
Donald Trump.

600
00:27:40,226 --> 00:27:41,460
Donald Trump thinks

601
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,996
[As Donald Trump]
we have a feud...

602
00:27:45,564 --> 00:27:47,800
[Regular voice]
because he won't do my show.

603
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:50,870
As if I could give a fuck
if that moron did my show.

604
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:55,307
We have a feud because he became
a presidential candidate.

605
00:27:55,407 --> 00:27:57,309
Now you're on my turf.

606
00:27:57,409 --> 00:27:59,311
And not just
a presidential candidate,

607
00:27:59,411 --> 00:28:01,247
A one-issue candidate...

608
00:28:01,347 --> 00:28:05,251
All about how Obama was
illegitimate as a president.

609
00:28:05,351 --> 00:28:07,086
Remember, he was sending
his investigators

610
00:28:07,186 --> 00:28:09,488
[As Donald Trump]
to Hawaii...

611
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:14,126
Who were finding
amazing things?

612
00:28:15,594 --> 00:28:17,296
[Regular voice]
Yeah, like the price

613
00:28:17,396 --> 00:28:19,265
Of the Mai Tais
in the hotel bar

614
00:28:19,365 --> 00:28:22,101
And, "What an idiot
our boss is"

615
00:28:22,201 --> 00:28:24,170
To send us here
on an expense account."

616
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:26,138
Amazing things.

617
00:28:28,775 --> 00:28:30,342
Yeah, we're still waiting
for those results.

618
00:28:30,442 --> 00:28:34,781
Anyway, so after Obama releases
his long-form birth certificate,

619
00:28:34,881 --> 00:28:39,318
Trump goes to, "Well, now I want
to see his college records."

620
00:28:41,387 --> 00:28:44,791
You know, 'cause a black guy
getting into college?

621
00:28:44,891 --> 00:28:48,294
Something fishy
about that, all right?

622
00:28:48,394 --> 00:28:51,798
So he offers the President of
the United States...

623
00:28:51,898 --> 00:28:54,133
Real class... $5 million

624
00:28:54,233 --> 00:28:57,636
To release his college records,
so I offered Donald Trump...

625
00:28:57,736 --> 00:29:00,973
Yes, on the air...
$5 million

626
00:29:01,073 --> 00:29:04,076
If he could prove that he
was not the love child

627
00:29:04,176 --> 00:29:07,579
Of his mother and
an orange-haired orangutan.

628
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:09,348
[Laughter, cheering,
and applause]

629
00:29:09,448 --> 00:29:12,885
Wait. Heh heh heh! Not...

630
00:29:16,288 --> 00:29:19,091
Not for no reason
because we showed with pictures

631
00:29:19,191 --> 00:29:20,326
That there are
only two things in nature

632
00:29:20,426 --> 00:29:22,661
That have that exact
same color hair...

633
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:25,998
Donald Trump
and an orange-haired orangutan.

634
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:28,034
[Laughter]

635
00:29:32,438 --> 00:29:36,175
And this dummy
releases his birth certificate

636
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:38,410
And sues me
and goes to the press

637
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:42,181
And turns what was a one-night,
one-joke gag

638
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:44,216
Into a three-month
national debate

639
00:29:44,316 --> 00:29:46,485
Over whether his mother
fucked an ape.

640
00:29:46,585 --> 00:29:49,021
[Laughter]

641
00:29:49,121 --> 00:29:53,025
He is not a bright man. So...

642
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:54,693
[Chuckles]

643
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:58,364
I am not going to say
another word about Donald Trump.

644
00:29:58,464 --> 00:30:01,200
All right. I'm going to say one
more thing about Donald Trump.

645
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,368
No, no. One more thing.

646
00:30:02,468 --> 00:30:04,403
But it's not even
really about him.

647
00:30:06,472 --> 00:30:09,708
I'm just using him
to ask a moral question.

648
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:11,878
Are you ready
for a moral question?

649
00:30:11,978 --> 00:30:13,079
[Applause]

650
00:30:13,179 --> 00:30:14,246
You sound like a great crowd.

651
00:30:14,346 --> 00:30:16,182
Are you ready
for a moral question?

652
00:30:16,282 --> 00:30:17,716
AUDIENCE: Yes!

653
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:19,785
Great. Here it is.

654
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:23,422
It's 1956.

655
00:30:24,991 --> 00:30:27,726
You're in
the locker room at Penn State.

656
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:29,361
[Soft laughter]

657
00:30:29,461 --> 00:30:33,232
You see a 10-year-old
Donald Trump walking

658
00:30:33,332 --> 00:30:36,435
Into the showers
with Jerry Sandusky.

659
00:30:38,337 --> 00:30:39,939
Do you save Jerry?

660
00:30:43,175 --> 00:30:45,844
A moral question,
ladies and gentlemen.

661
00:30:45,945 --> 00:30:47,880
[Chuckles]

662
00:30:49,348 --> 00:30:51,217
Now, look,
I tell you something,

663
00:30:51,317 --> 00:30:55,087
I understand why
Donald Trump votes Republican.

664
00:30:55,187 --> 00:30:58,090
I understand why anyone
in the top 1% of wage earners

665
00:30:58,190 --> 00:30:59,425
Votes Republican.

666
00:30:59,525 --> 00:31:01,360
They represent you perfectly.

667
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:03,695
Anybody else
who votes Republican are

668
00:31:03,795 --> 00:31:06,698
Just one of corporate
America's useful idiots.

669
00:31:06,798 --> 00:31:07,866
[Applause]

670
00:31:07,967 --> 00:31:09,068
It's true.

671
00:31:12,304 --> 00:31:18,044
I mean, we've seen the people
at the Tea Party rallies.

672
00:31:18,144 --> 00:31:19,878
They're not wealthy.

673
00:31:19,979 --> 00:31:24,516
How come their agenda is exactly
the same as the Koch brothers'?

674
00:31:24,616 --> 00:31:27,719
How come in their mind
the problem with our economy is

675
00:31:27,819 --> 00:31:30,889
Not banks that
are too big to fail or CEOs

676
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:33,859
That make 500 times
what the average worker makes

677
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:37,063
Or lobbyists who write the laws,
literally?

678
00:31:37,163 --> 00:31:40,899
No, the problem with our economy
is poor people hoarding money.

679
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,768
[Laughter]

680
00:31:44,803 --> 00:31:46,105
The takers!

681
00:31:46,205 --> 00:31:49,408
If there's one thing
that drives Republicans nuts!

682
00:31:49,508 --> 00:31:53,245
I mean, obviously, other
than the scourge of voter fraud.

683
00:31:53,345 --> 00:31:56,415
Don't... don't get me started
on that.

684
00:31:56,515 --> 00:32:00,586
But this other thing that drives
them nuts, it's the takers.

685
00:32:00,686 --> 00:32:02,288
The 47%. Remember them?

686
00:32:02,388 --> 00:32:05,357
The 47% of them
who don't pay any income taxes.

687
00:32:05,457 --> 00:32:09,195
Just mooching
off the federal tit.

688
00:32:09,295 --> 00:32:12,431
Sucking on the tit of...
"Get off my tits, you...

689
00:32:12,531 --> 00:32:16,402
My tits are sore from you people
sucking on my tits so much."

690
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:21,040
This is why they hate Obamacare.

691
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:23,542
They see it
as just another giveaway.

692
00:32:23,642 --> 00:32:25,877
You subsidize one kid's inhaler,

693
00:32:25,978 --> 00:32:29,048
Every kid is going to think
breathing is an entitlement.

694
00:32:29,148 --> 00:32:31,883
[Laughter]

695
00:32:31,984 --> 00:32:34,553
"That's not blood
you're coughing up, Billy.

696
00:32:34,653 --> 00:32:36,055
That's freedom."

697
00:32:36,155 --> 00:32:38,090
[Laughter]

698
00:32:40,759 --> 00:32:43,562
But, of course, the problem
with Obamacare is

699
00:32:43,662 --> 00:32:45,064
Not too much socialism.

700
00:32:45,164 --> 00:32:47,399
It's still too much capitalism.

701
00:32:47,499 --> 00:32:49,068
You know, every
other big-boy country in the w...

702
00:32:49,168 --> 00:32:50,202
[Audience member whistles,
others applaud]

703
00:32:50,302 --> 00:32:51,570
Thank you, liberals.

704
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:54,573
[Cheering and applause]

705
00:32:54,673 --> 00:32:59,411
Every other big-boy country in
the world has figured this out,

706
00:32:59,511 --> 00:33:02,214
That you can have 90%
of the economy.

707
00:33:02,314 --> 00:33:05,384
Just certain things should not
be left to the profit motive,

708
00:33:05,484 --> 00:33:08,987
Like health care,
like people living and dying...

709
00:33:09,088 --> 00:33:11,923
Like prisons
should not be for-profit,

710
00:33:12,024 --> 00:33:14,093
And they are in this country.

711
00:33:14,193 --> 00:33:17,063
Education should not
be for profit.

712
00:33:17,163 --> 00:33:19,498
Elections should
not be for profit.

713
00:33:19,598 --> 00:33:23,035
Wars. Halliburton
shouldn't be making a killing

714
00:33:23,135 --> 00:33:24,370
Making a killing.

715
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:26,205
[Applause]

716
00:33:26,305 --> 00:33:29,108
But on the Right,
there is this perverse view

717
00:33:29,208 --> 00:33:31,610
That the free market
is always the perfect answer

718
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:33,379
For everything.

719
00:33:33,479 --> 00:33:35,047
And government...
[blows raspberry]

720
00:33:35,147 --> 00:33:37,616
"Government! Government
should only do three things...

721
00:33:37,716 --> 00:33:41,187
Bomb Arabs,
pay farmers not to grow corn..."

722
00:33:41,287 --> 00:33:43,222
[Laughter]

723
00:33:46,325 --> 00:33:48,494
"And name buildings
after Ronald Reagan."

724
00:33:48,594 --> 00:33:50,562
That's always a winner,
isn't it?

725
00:33:50,662 --> 00:33:51,730
[Chuckles]

726
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:53,099
You know this.

727
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,304
No, I just want to know
from the Republicans,

728
00:33:58,404 --> 00:33:59,905
How do they do it?

729
00:34:00,005 --> 00:34:02,841
How do they get struggling
and working-class people

730
00:34:02,941 --> 00:34:04,476
To vote for them?

731
00:34:04,576 --> 00:34:05,644
[Woman yells]

732
00:34:05,744 --> 00:34:07,813
What is it?

733
00:34:07,913 --> 00:34:09,081
[Woman yells again]

734
00:34:09,181 --> 00:34:10,249
Again, the...

735
00:34:10,349 --> 00:34:11,417
MAN: Jesus.

736
00:34:11,517 --> 00:34:13,685
Yeah.
OK, you run with that.

737
00:34:13,785 --> 00:34:15,354
[Laughter]

738
00:34:17,789 --> 00:34:20,926
[Man yelling]

739
00:34:21,026 --> 00:34:22,128
No. Actually...

740
00:34:22,228 --> 00:34:23,295
MAN: ribbon cutting...

741
00:34:23,395 --> 00:34:24,463
BILL: What's that?

742
00:34:24,563 --> 00:34:25,697
MAN: your vow
to kick

743
00:34:25,797 --> 00:34:29,034
Donald Trump's ass at
the Post Office Pavilion

744
00:34:29,135 --> 00:34:30,536
Ribbon cutting.

745
00:34:30,636 --> 00:34:32,204
WOMAN:
We love you, Bill Maher.

746
00:34:32,304 --> 00:34:34,240
[Cheering and applause]

747
00:34:35,807 --> 00:34:38,544
BILL: I'm so glad that
my HBO special has turned

748
00:34:38,644 --> 00:34:40,646
Into a Tea Party rally.

749
00:34:40,746 --> 00:34:43,182
[Laughter and applause]

750
00:34:46,485 --> 00:34:49,188
Hopefully, the difference
is we have security.

751
00:34:53,659 --> 00:34:57,563
No, it's ironic because
Obama's slogan was Hope,

752
00:34:57,663 --> 00:35:00,232
And I think what
the Republicans always sell is

753
00:35:00,332 --> 00:35:02,734
Hope and the word
they use is "soon."

754
00:35:02,834 --> 00:35:04,336
I notice they
use that all the time.

755
00:35:04,436 --> 00:35:06,172
After the State of the Union
last time,

756
00:35:06,272 --> 00:35:09,241
The Republican rebuttal,
the guy said, "You know",

757
00:35:09,341 --> 00:35:12,678
"Democrats are always talking
about haves and have-nots.

758
00:35:12,778 --> 00:35:15,514
"That's not how we see it
in the Republican party.

759
00:35:15,614 --> 00:35:19,017
We see haves and soon-to-haves."

760
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:20,386
[Laughter]

761
00:35:20,486 --> 00:35:22,688
Fuck you. This is so cynical.

762
00:35:22,788 --> 00:35:24,490
This holding out the carrots.

763
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:26,992
"I'm going to be the next one.
Soon for me!"

764
00:35:27,092 --> 00:35:28,327
It's pathetic.

765
00:35:28,427 --> 00:35:30,262
It's like the way
my dog looks at me in the car,

766
00:35:30,362 --> 00:35:33,098
Like, "Tomorrow
you'll let me drive?"

767
00:35:33,199 --> 00:35:35,133
[Laughter]

768
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:43,942
The senator from Florida,
Marco Rubio,

769
00:35:44,042 --> 00:35:45,877
In his stump speech,

770
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:48,880
He always says,
"When Americans drive through

771
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:51,683
"A wealthy neighborhood,
they're not jealous.

772
00:35:51,783 --> 00:35:55,721
"They look at those fine houses
and they say, 'Congratulations.

773
00:35:55,821 --> 00:35:57,656
We'll be joining you soon.'"

774
00:35:59,825 --> 00:36:03,662
You know what,
other than winning the lottery,

775
00:36:03,762 --> 00:36:08,667
What path is there for the
nurse, you know, or the fireman,

776
00:36:08,767 --> 00:36:11,837
The cop, all the people we say
are our heroes? The soldier.

777
00:36:11,937 --> 00:36:15,507
What path is there
for them to be joining you soon

778
00:36:15,607 --> 00:36:17,509
In the mansion on the hill?

779
00:36:17,609 --> 00:36:19,378
I happen to know
this one is bullshit

780
00:36:19,478 --> 00:36:22,013
Because for whatever reason,
when I was a kid,

781
00:36:22,113 --> 00:36:26,017
My father used to like to drive
through wealthy neighborhoods,

782
00:36:26,117 --> 00:36:28,520
Like, you know, when
the Christmas lights were up.

783
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:32,291
I never once heard that
we would be joining them soon.

784
00:36:32,391 --> 00:36:33,525
[Laughter]

785
00:36:33,625 --> 00:36:36,027
This never came up in the car.

786
00:36:36,127 --> 00:36:38,630
He just liked to look.

787
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:40,366
It's like we went to the zoo.

788
00:36:40,466 --> 00:36:42,368
He didn't think
he was going to be a rhinoceros.

789
00:36:42,468 --> 00:36:44,270
He just wanted to look at it.

790
00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:45,471
[Applause]

791
00:36:50,175 --> 00:36:51,510
[Chuckles]

792
00:36:51,610 --> 00:36:54,613
It's funny also the way
that people who hate socialism

793
00:36:54,713 --> 00:36:58,550
So much are the first ones
online for government giveaways.

794
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:01,820
Tea Party people love Medicare.
They love Social Security.

795
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,790
It's perks.
That's what government is.

796
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:08,327
It's giving people free shit,
and people love free shit.

797
00:37:08,427 --> 00:37:10,496
Every government does it,
including the Republicans.

798
00:37:10,596 --> 00:37:11,797
Bush did it.

799
00:37:11,897 --> 00:37:15,501
Remember the prescription drug
program for the elderly?

800
00:37:15,601 --> 00:37:16,835
It wasn't needed.

801
00:37:16,935 --> 00:37:18,737
They were getting
their drugs through Medicare,

802
00:37:18,837 --> 00:37:22,107
But, you know,
it's a vote getter.

803
00:37:22,207 --> 00:37:25,176
[As George W. Bush]
"Hey, here are some free drugs.

804
00:37:25,277 --> 00:37:26,712
Have a drug..."

805
00:37:26,812 --> 00:37:28,347
You know,
Viagra had just come out,

806
00:37:28,447 --> 00:37:31,850
So, "Hey, have a boner on Bush.
What do you think about that?"

807
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:33,018
[Laughter]

808
00:37:33,118 --> 00:37:35,987
"Hey, remember me
on election day,"

809
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:37,423
"Won't you, folks?"

810
00:37:37,523 --> 00:37:39,257
"I'm the guy who gave you
that boner... George Bush..."

811
00:37:39,358 --> 00:37:41,059
[Regular voice]
Really.

812
00:37:41,159 --> 00:37:43,362
That's all it is, perks.

813
00:37:43,462 --> 00:37:46,365
Same as religion, by the way.
Religion is also perks.

814
00:37:46,465 --> 00:37:49,067
Those perks are just
better because, you know, you're

815
00:37:49,167 --> 00:37:51,937
Selling an invisible
product, so...

816
00:37:52,037 --> 00:37:53,238
You know, really...

817
00:37:53,339 --> 00:37:54,706
Nobody ever
came back from heaven

818
00:37:54,806 --> 00:37:57,208
And gave it a bad Yelp review.

819
00:37:57,309 --> 00:38:00,111
[Applause]

820
00:38:00,211 --> 00:38:03,982
"Oh, I was expecting
so much more.

821
00:38:04,082 --> 00:38:06,151
What a disappointment
after all the hype."

822
00:38:06,251 --> 00:38:09,888
No. Ha ha!

823
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:12,991
Now, people know this about me,

824
00:38:13,091 --> 00:38:14,993
I'm not an especially
religious person, but, um...

825
00:38:15,093 --> 00:38:16,227
[Laughter]

826
00:38:16,328 --> 00:38:18,830
No, it's true.
That is true about me.

827
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:20,999
But I got to say,
I kind of like this Pope Frank.

828
00:38:21,099 --> 00:38:23,168
First of all,
he's just a lot more...

829
00:38:23,268 --> 00:38:24,836
[Applause]

830
00:38:24,936 --> 00:38:26,838
Cosmopolitan than every pope.

831
00:38:26,938 --> 00:38:30,175
You know, he's from Argentina.
He was a Jesuit.

832
00:38:30,275 --> 00:38:33,178
His real name is
Jorge Bergoglio.

833
00:38:33,278 --> 00:38:35,847
Sounds like an expensive
pair of shoes, doesn't it?

834
00:38:35,947 --> 00:38:37,883
"Hey, look at these
Jorge Bergoglios.

835
00:38:37,983 --> 00:38:40,686
They're, like, 850 bucks."

836
00:38:40,786 --> 00:38:42,187
And, also, I love it that,
you know,

837
00:38:42,287 --> 00:38:45,691
He doesn't take this shit
too seriously.

838
00:38:45,791 --> 00:38:48,694
You know,
a couple of months ago,

839
00:38:48,794 --> 00:38:51,397
This woman called up the Vatican

840
00:38:51,497 --> 00:38:53,699
And said that she wanted
to take Communion again

841
00:38:53,799 --> 00:38:56,201
And they wouldn't let her
because she was divorced

842
00:38:56,301 --> 00:38:58,203
And remarried, which
I remember is a big no-no

843
00:38:58,303 --> 00:38:59,671
In the Catholic church.

844
00:38:59,771 --> 00:39:05,176
And the pope actually called her
back and said, "Yeah, go ahead."

845
00:39:05,276 --> 00:39:07,779
He did. He was like,
"Ah, just... fuck it... and do it.

846
00:39:07,879 --> 00:39:09,981
"You know what?
Just fucking do it.

847
00:39:10,081 --> 00:39:14,520
They got a lot of rules
around here, but just do it."

848
00:39:16,087 --> 00:39:17,322
I mean, he's like that.

849
00:39:17,423 --> 00:39:19,725
The first pronouncement
he made when he became pope,

850
00:39:19,825 --> 00:39:22,327
He said atheists
can go to heaven.

851
00:39:22,428 --> 00:39:25,764
And we were like,
"Well, we don't believe in it,

852
00:39:25,864 --> 00:39:29,167
"But it's a nice gesture.

853
00:39:29,267 --> 00:39:31,837
We appreciate that."

854
00:39:31,937 --> 00:39:33,505
And trust me, when he said that,

855
00:39:33,605 --> 00:39:35,507
The other dudes
in the Vatican were like,

856
00:39:35,607 --> 00:39:39,177
"Oh, we got to prepare
the poison now.

857
00:39:39,277 --> 00:39:43,515
This guy is just off message."

858
00:39:43,615 --> 00:39:48,353
And he is. He is
the Joe Biden of Catholicism.

859
00:39:48,454 --> 00:39:50,188
He really is.

860
00:39:50,288 --> 00:39:51,890
[Applause]

861
00:39:53,459 --> 00:39:57,429
A couple of months in, he said,
"We shouldn't judge gays."

862
00:39:57,529 --> 00:39:59,865
[Cheering]

863
00:39:59,965 --> 00:40:05,937
And the Vatican people
were like, "What?!"

864
00:40:06,037 --> 00:40:09,441
"What are you talking
about? That's what we do here,

865
00:40:09,541 --> 00:40:13,378
Gays judging gays.
That's our whole thing."

866
00:40:13,479 --> 00:40:14,613
[Laughter and applause]

867
00:40:14,713 --> 00:40:16,047
So...

868
00:40:16,147 --> 00:40:17,583
[Cheering]

869
00:40:22,821 --> 00:40:25,824
Now, how about
my man, John Paul II, becoming

870
00:40:25,924 --> 00:40:27,559
A saint this year?

871
00:40:27,659 --> 00:40:30,562
[Faint applause]

872
00:40:30,662 --> 00:40:33,732
Oh, you people are so jaded.
You know what? This is big.

873
00:40:33,832 --> 00:40:36,568
This is sainthood, baby.

874
00:40:36,668 --> 00:40:38,069
OK, let me tell you,
let me school you

875
00:40:38,169 --> 00:40:40,405
On what goes on
in the Catholic church.

876
00:40:40,506 --> 00:40:44,543
To become a saint,
you need two confirmed miracles.

877
00:40:44,643 --> 00:40:46,578
Confirmed. No bullshit.

878
00:40:46,678 --> 00:40:48,113
[Laughter]

879
00:40:51,082 --> 00:40:53,251
I love the Catholic church.

880
00:40:53,351 --> 00:40:55,286
I love the way they take
their own shit so seriously,

881
00:40:55,386 --> 00:40:56,722
The bullshit they invented.

882
00:40:56,822 --> 00:40:58,690
And then they're like,
"Oh, yeah, that's serious."

883
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:01,026
[Laughter]

884
00:41:01,126 --> 00:41:03,529
So here's what happened.

885
00:41:03,629 --> 00:41:06,197
John Paul II died in 2005.

886
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:07,766
Remember,
Bush went to the funeral.

887
00:41:07,866 --> 00:41:09,635
Oh, it was
like his best day in office.

888
00:41:09,735 --> 00:41:11,369
He was like a kid at the circus.

889
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:13,038
He fucking loved it.
It was like...

890
00:41:13,138 --> 00:41:14,573
[As George W. Bush]
"Oh, nobody is answering

891
00:41:14,673 --> 00:41:17,576
"Any hard questions about me,

892
00:41:17,676 --> 00:41:19,210
"And there's
other world leaders here

893
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:21,046
"And a dead Christian guy

894
00:41:21,146 --> 00:41:23,481
And there's colors
and pageantry."

895
00:41:23,582 --> 00:41:25,050
[Regular voice]
He was in heaven.

896
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:26,918
OK. Ha ha!

897
00:41:27,018 --> 00:41:29,054
So he dies in 2005.

898
00:41:29,154 --> 00:41:33,224
Got his first miracle in 2007,

899
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:35,226
Which is, like,
ridiculously early,

900
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:37,729
But I knew he could do it.

901
00:41:37,829 --> 00:41:40,398
And when he got that one,
I fucking called it.

902
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:43,569
I predicted... I said he
is going to drop another miracle

903
00:41:43,669 --> 00:41:45,103
Within five years,

904
00:41:45,203 --> 00:41:47,205
And he fucking did it.

905
00:41:47,305 --> 00:41:48,574
He got his second.

906
00:41:48,674 --> 00:41:50,075
You know
what the second miracle was?

907
00:41:50,175 --> 00:41:52,744
I am not making this up...

908
00:41:52,844 --> 00:41:56,147
A brain-sick peasant
in Costa Rica prayed

909
00:41:56,247 --> 00:41:59,885
To the dead pope
to get better and did!

910
00:41:59,985 --> 00:42:02,187
[Laughter and applause]

911
00:42:02,287 --> 00:42:05,824
Doesn't get any more
confirmed than that, OK, people?

912
00:42:05,924 --> 00:42:08,193
One thing happened,
and then another thing happened.

913
00:42:08,293 --> 00:42:10,929
It's called science.
Look it up on the Google.

914
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:14,299
[Chuckles]

915
00:42:17,468 --> 00:42:19,705
But you know what,
the silver lining in this is

916
00:42:19,805 --> 00:42:23,775
That millennials... not religious.

917
00:42:23,875 --> 00:42:24,976
They just did a survey.

918
00:42:25,076 --> 00:42:27,212
Millennials...
So much less religious

919
00:42:27,312 --> 00:42:29,948
Than any other generation
we've ever had in America.

920
00:42:30,048 --> 00:42:31,983
And people talk all the time...

921
00:42:32,083 --> 00:42:33,318
[Applause]

922
00:42:33,418 --> 00:42:36,622
About how the Republicans
have a problem with women,

923
00:42:36,722 --> 00:42:38,123
Which they do, of course,

924
00:42:38,223 --> 00:42:40,558
And they have a problem
with minorities, which they do.

925
00:42:40,659 --> 00:42:41,727
But what they don't
talk about is

926
00:42:41,827 --> 00:42:43,294
They have a problem
with young people

927
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:45,897
Because the Republican
party gets more religious

928
00:42:45,997 --> 00:42:47,733
And the young people get less.

929
00:42:47,833 --> 00:42:49,901
In the last Pew survey...
Get this...

930
00:42:50,001 --> 00:42:56,241
48% of Republicans
said evolution is a lie.

931
00:42:56,341 --> 00:43:01,579
22% said Obama is or very well
might be the Antichrist.

932
00:43:03,782 --> 00:43:05,817
Like that's a thing.

933
00:43:05,917 --> 00:43:07,886
[Laughter]

934
00:43:11,623 --> 00:43:13,158
Here's a great one
from that poll.

935
00:43:13,258 --> 00:43:20,231
44% said Obama will "Find a way
to stay in office after 2017."

936
00:43:20,331 --> 00:43:22,200
[Laughter]

937
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:26,037
Wow. That is full-on
"eat a paint chip" nuts.

938
00:43:26,137 --> 00:43:28,373
[Laughter]

939
00:43:28,473 --> 00:43:31,209
"Find a way."

940
00:43:31,309 --> 00:43:35,046
Here's a great one... 41%
of Republicans think Benghazi

941
00:43:35,146 --> 00:43:37,415
Was the worst scandal
in American history.

942
00:43:39,317 --> 00:43:41,687
Second worst was
when Kanye West grabbed the mike

943
00:43:41,787 --> 00:43:44,055
From Taylor Swift, obviously.

944
00:43:44,155 --> 00:43:46,491
Second worst day, but...

945
00:43:46,591 --> 00:43:50,561
Yes, they are... so obsessed
with Benghazi.

946
00:43:50,662 --> 00:43:54,232
They want to know whether it
was planned, like Pearl Harbor,

947
00:43:54,332 --> 00:43:57,235
Or unplanned,
like a Palin pregnancy.

948
00:43:57,335 --> 00:43:59,270
[Laughter]

949
00:44:01,439 --> 00:44:05,510
If you watch Fox News,
it is Benghazi 24/7.

950
00:44:05,610 --> 00:44:07,846
Here's what happened
in their Fox News mind...

951
00:44:07,946 --> 00:44:09,180
In their bubble.

952
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:10,849
Here's what happened
when the shit started

953
00:44:10,949 --> 00:44:12,150
To go down in Benghazi.

954
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:14,986
They called up Obama...
Not his real name.

955
00:44:16,421 --> 00:44:20,992
His real name is a series
of African clicking sounds.

956
00:44:21,092 --> 00:44:23,128
[Clicks tongue]

957
00:44:23,228 --> 00:44:26,197
That's his name. So...

958
00:44:26,297 --> 00:44:30,702
They called up President...
[Clicking tongue]

959
00:44:30,802 --> 00:44:33,204
Wait. Let me...
Let me get this.

960
00:44:33,304 --> 00:44:35,573
Ooh. Ha ha!

961
00:44:37,809 --> 00:44:38,877
[Clicking tongue]

962
00:44:38,977 --> 00:44:40,545
That's his name.

963
00:44:40,645 --> 00:44:43,048
They called up that guy,
but he was praying to Mecca,

964
00:44:43,148 --> 00:44:45,383
So he couldn't take the call.

965
00:44:45,483 --> 00:44:46,551
So then they called up

966
00:44:46,651 --> 00:44:48,653
Then-Secretary of State
Hillary Clinton,

967
00:44:48,754 --> 00:44:50,321
Who took the call but said,

968
00:44:50,421 --> 00:44:55,526
"I don't care if Americans are
dying. I'm having lesbian sex.

969
00:44:55,626 --> 00:44:58,229
Now, go away and bring me
another big plate of pussy."

970
00:44:58,329 --> 00:45:00,265
That's what she said.

971
00:45:06,204 --> 00:45:09,007
Here's one. Ha ha!

972
00:45:09,107 --> 00:45:12,010
Here's one. You probably could
guess this one

973
00:45:12,110 --> 00:45:13,745
That I love
from the poll of Republicans.

974
00:45:13,845 --> 00:45:16,982
45% of Republicans
think that Obama is

975
00:45:17,082 --> 00:45:24,022
Probably not a real American
because he "feels foreign."

976
00:45:24,122 --> 00:45:25,690
"Feels foreign."

977
00:45:25,791 --> 00:45:30,228
Well, you know what, to me,
John Boehner feels female.

978
00:45:30,328 --> 00:45:31,863
[Laughter]

979
00:45:31,963 --> 00:45:35,300
He does. He... ha ha!

980
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:37,202
He wears a lot of bronzer.

981
00:45:37,302 --> 00:45:40,371
You know, he gets teary
over nothing.

982
00:45:40,471 --> 00:45:43,174
I'm always like, "This guy
is tanned, rested, and hormonal",

983
00:45:43,274 --> 00:45:45,710
For crying out loud."

984
00:45:45,811 --> 00:45:48,613
Is he the Speaker of the House
or the mother of the bride?

985
00:45:48,713 --> 00:45:50,648
[Laughter]

986
00:45:53,651 --> 00:45:57,923
Maybe that's the source of the
Republican problem with women

987
00:45:58,023 --> 00:46:00,558
Because they sure
do have a problem with women.

988
00:46:00,658 --> 00:46:02,861
You know that Obama
beat Mitt Romney

989
00:46:02,961 --> 00:46:06,832
Among single women 67-31.

990
00:46:06,932 --> 00:46:11,837
Those numbers you don't
often see in American politics.

991
00:46:11,937 --> 00:46:15,740
That is a very clear message,
and the message is,

992
00:46:15,841 --> 00:46:17,208
"Get off me."

993
00:46:20,511 --> 00:46:24,515
Oh, women must be so tired
of Republican Congress people

994
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:27,785
Being medical supergeniuses
about their vagina.

995
00:46:27,886 --> 00:46:28,987
It's...

996
00:46:29,087 --> 00:46:31,056
[Applause]

997
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:35,526
Let's switch it up
for a while and hear

998
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:37,128
What gynecologists have to say

999
00:46:37,228 --> 00:46:39,397
About the national debt,
shall we?

1000
00:46:40,966 --> 00:46:44,702
I mean, when
did this start in America

1001
00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:46,872
That everybody gets to weigh in

1002
00:46:46,972 --> 00:46:49,274
On women's
private reproductive issues?

1003
00:46:49,374 --> 00:46:50,708
Hobby Lobby.

1004
00:46:50,808 --> 00:46:54,712
Who gives a shit
what Hobby Lobby thinks?

1005
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:56,882
Hobby Lobby gets a vote?

1006
00:46:56,982 --> 00:46:59,117
They're
a Pentecostal yarn store.

1007
00:47:00,585 --> 00:47:02,820
You sell glue sticks
to cat ladies.

1008
00:47:02,921 --> 00:47:07,458
Why are you getting to voice
an opinion on somebody else's...

1009
00:47:07,558 --> 00:47:10,161
[Laughter]

1010
00:47:10,261 --> 00:47:12,663
Politicians never
used to talk about this shit,

1011
00:47:12,763 --> 00:47:14,499
And now they can't stop.

1012
00:47:14,599 --> 00:47:17,936
Mike Huckabee, who wants to be
president of the United States,

1013
00:47:18,036 --> 00:47:19,604
Said this year...

1014
00:47:19,704 --> 00:47:22,673
He said, "Women vote
for the Democratic party"

1015
00:47:22,773 --> 00:47:24,842
"Because Democrats
are the party of government

1016
00:47:24,943 --> 00:47:26,978
And they pay
for their birth control."

1017
00:47:27,078 --> 00:47:28,713
And then he actually said,

1018
00:47:28,813 --> 00:47:33,184
"And women can't control
their libido"...

1019
00:47:33,284 --> 00:47:37,288
Especially around Mike Huckabee.
Am I right, ladies?

1020
00:47:37,388 --> 00:47:38,523
[Chuckles]

1021
00:47:38,623 --> 00:47:40,625
If anybody would know.

1022
00:47:40,725 --> 00:47:42,860
I mean,
this never used to happen.

1023
00:47:42,961 --> 00:47:44,862
They had
contraception in the fifties.

1024
00:47:44,963 --> 00:47:49,867
I swear to God, Eisenhower never
once used the word "libido."

1025
00:47:49,968 --> 00:47:53,038
I mean, if
somebody had asked Eisenhower

1026
00:47:53,138 --> 00:47:57,408
About contraception,
he would have went, "What?"

1027
00:48:00,845 --> 00:48:02,013
"I was a general."

1028
00:48:04,582 --> 00:48:06,484
"I sent men to kill and die.

1029
00:48:06,584 --> 00:48:09,020
I don't care what
you do with your come."

1030
00:48:10,788 --> 00:48:12,490
"Go ask your mommy."

1031
00:48:12,590 --> 00:48:15,660
[Applause]

1032
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:16,827
But...

1033
00:48:16,928 --> 00:48:18,363
[Applause]

1034
00:48:19,597 --> 00:48:23,434
And, you know,
the old-school Republicans,

1035
00:48:23,534 --> 00:48:28,173
The indoor Republicans,
the potty-trained Republicans,

1036
00:48:28,273 --> 00:48:30,341
They want to get
these other nuts to stop talking

1037
00:48:30,441 --> 00:48:34,012
About women's lady parts,
but they can't help themselves.

1038
00:48:34,112 --> 00:48:36,514
It's like Dr. Strangelove's arm,
you know?

1039
00:48:36,614 --> 00:48:38,583
It's just,
"Uh! I can't help it."

1040
00:48:40,318 --> 00:48:43,354
Even when they try to
impress women, they fuck it up.

1041
00:48:43,454 --> 00:48:47,258
Remember Mitt Romney with
the "binders full of women"?

1042
00:48:47,358 --> 00:48:48,626
Right? I'm not making that up.

1043
00:48:48,726 --> 00:48:52,863
Mitt Romney actually
said, trying to big himself up

1044
00:48:52,964 --> 00:48:55,733
About women, said, "You know,
when I was governor, I wanted"

1045
00:48:55,833 --> 00:48:57,068
To hire women..."

1046
00:48:58,803 --> 00:49:01,973
"But I didn't know any."

1047
00:49:02,073 --> 00:49:03,474
That's where
the binders came in.

1048
00:49:03,574 --> 00:49:04,642
That's when he ordered...

1049
00:49:04,742 --> 00:49:08,513
"Bob, get me everything
we have on women."

1050
00:49:08,613 --> 00:49:11,016
[Laughter]

1051
00:49:13,084 --> 00:49:15,953
"This could be big, Bob. I want
to get in on the ground floor.

1052
00:49:16,054 --> 00:49:20,058
"I don't want to get scooped
on this one. Women as workers.

1053
00:49:20,158 --> 00:49:21,659
"This could be really something.

1054
00:49:21,759 --> 00:49:24,996
"They work for less.
I know I love that.

1055
00:49:25,096 --> 00:49:26,664
So let's get on this
right away."

1056
00:49:26,764 --> 00:49:28,699
[Applause]

1057
00:49:35,173 --> 00:49:38,043
There was a Republican
Congressman from Missouri

1058
00:49:38,143 --> 00:49:40,811
Who said that fetuses
masturbate in the womb.

1059
00:49:40,911 --> 00:49:42,047
I could not make...

1060
00:49:42,147 --> 00:49:43,281
[Laughter]

1061
00:49:43,381 --> 00:49:46,017
I know. You thought
that was the baby kicking.

1062
00:49:46,117 --> 00:49:49,220
No, no. That's whacking,
not kicking.

1063
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:51,022
No. That's that.

1064
00:49:51,122 --> 00:49:54,559
[Chuckles]

1065
00:49:54,659 --> 00:49:58,929
You know what? I have done
every drug known to man.

1066
00:49:59,030 --> 00:50:00,698
[Scattered cheers]

1067
00:50:00,798 --> 00:50:03,668
This thought
never came into my mind.

1068
00:50:03,768 --> 00:50:04,969
[Laughter]

1069
00:50:05,070 --> 00:50:07,538
I mean, a lot of crazy
thoughts came into my mind,

1070
00:50:07,638 --> 00:50:09,040
And I swatted them away,

1071
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:11,542
But never once,
no matter what I was doing,

1072
00:50:11,642 --> 00:50:13,978
Did I ever think, "Yeah,
there's kids whacking in there."

1073
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:16,013
That's probably..."

1074
00:50:17,482 --> 00:50:19,050
I mean, Why
would you even say that?

1075
00:50:19,150 --> 00:50:21,886
Why? Of course! Because they're
all abortion nuts. That's why.

1076
00:50:21,986 --> 00:50:24,389
They're always trying
to prove that science knows

1077
00:50:24,489 --> 00:50:27,092
That life
begins earlier and earlier.

1078
00:50:27,192 --> 00:50:29,894
"How can you kill that kid? He's
having a great time in there.

1079
00:50:29,994 --> 00:50:32,930
He's whacking,
and he's watching videos..."

1080
00:50:34,499 --> 00:50:37,635
Oh, yes, the one branch
of science they believe in.

1081
00:50:39,170 --> 00:50:40,238
Sorry, global warming.

1082
00:50:40,338 --> 00:50:42,240
If only you were caused
by sluts fucking,

1083
00:50:42,340 --> 00:50:44,075
We could do something about you.

1084
00:50:44,175 --> 00:50:46,111
[Applause]

1085
00:50:49,013 --> 00:50:50,915
It's always about sluts fucking.

1086
00:50:51,015 --> 00:50:52,217
I'm telling you,

1087
00:50:52,317 --> 00:50:55,086
These people never
got over the sexual revolution.

1088
00:50:55,186 --> 00:50:56,587
Fuck. They
never got over the Civil War.

1089
00:50:56,687 --> 00:50:58,123
What am I talking about?

1090
00:50:59,857 --> 00:51:02,026
But especially
the sexual revolution.

1091
00:51:02,127 --> 00:51:04,195
In their mind, life begins

1092
00:51:04,295 --> 00:51:06,564
When a man and a woman
share an appetizer.

1093
00:51:06,664 --> 00:51:10,535
[Laughter]

1094
00:51:10,635 --> 00:51:14,539
And God loves
every single, solitary speck

1095
00:51:14,639 --> 00:51:19,210
And goo of human life until
it tries to sneak into America,

1096
00:51:19,310 --> 00:51:20,878
And then life
can go fuck itself.

1097
00:51:20,978 --> 00:51:22,247
[Cheering]

1098
00:51:25,650 --> 00:51:27,885
Oh, yeah.

1099
00:51:27,985 --> 00:51:31,055
America is a shining city
on a hill.

1100
00:51:31,156 --> 00:51:32,890
And we don't need
a bunch of Guatemalan kids

1101
00:51:32,990 --> 00:51:34,592
Tracking mud through it.

1102
00:51:38,663 --> 00:51:40,898
No, they're crazy in the mind

1103
00:51:40,998 --> 00:51:42,400
Because America
is finally changing.

1104
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:45,236
This is what
is so scary to them.

1105
00:51:45,336 --> 00:51:47,905
Hispanics are ascendant
in this country.

1106
00:51:48,005 --> 00:51:49,840
We do have a black president.

1107
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:51,909
A third of the country
can get gay-married.

1108
00:51:52,009 --> 00:51:53,278
A third of the country

1109
00:51:53,378 --> 00:51:54,479
Has medical marijuana.

1110
00:51:54,579 --> 00:51:55,913
[Applause]

1111
00:51:56,013 --> 00:51:59,083
America is changing.

1112
00:51:59,184 --> 00:52:01,552
Two states have
regular old roll up a fatty

1113
00:52:01,652 --> 00:52:03,688
And watch "SpongeBob" marijuana.

1114
00:52:03,788 --> 00:52:05,089
[Cheering]

1115
00:52:05,190 --> 00:52:08,359
I'm telling you,
it's a new dawn of some kind.

1116
00:52:08,459 --> 00:52:11,529
There's a Hindu in Congress,
There's two Muslims in Congress.

1117
00:52:11,629 --> 00:52:14,365
There are 6 openly gay
people in Congress.

1118
00:52:14,465 --> 00:52:16,201
I know we missed it this time,

1119
00:52:16,301 --> 00:52:18,703
But the NFL...
The barrier has been broken...

1120
00:52:18,803 --> 00:52:21,639
Is going to have
a gay player very soon.

1121
00:52:21,739 --> 00:52:25,376
[Applause]

1122
00:52:25,476 --> 00:52:29,580
I predict in five years,
the NFL will be completely gay.

1123
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:30,948
[Laughter]

1124
00:52:31,048 --> 00:52:32,750
[Chuckles]

1125
00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:37,922
There will be new penalties
like, "Eligible man downfield."

1126
00:52:41,659 --> 00:52:43,060
"Roughing the snapper."

1127
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:45,062
You know.
That's the snapper now.

1128
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:46,897
I made that part up.

1129
00:52:50,067 --> 00:52:51,168
No, it's true.

1130
00:52:51,269 --> 00:52:52,437
This is what's
rocking their world, is

1131
00:52:52,537 --> 00:52:54,572
That heterosexuals
are not getting married anymore

1132
00:52:54,672 --> 00:52:55,906
And gay people are.

1133
00:52:56,006 --> 00:52:57,408
It's nothing logical.

1134
00:52:57,508 --> 00:53:04,014
It's just this onslaught of gay
and pot and black and Hispanic!

1135
00:53:04,114 --> 00:53:07,184
You know,
it's the sixties dorm room

1136
00:53:07,285 --> 00:53:10,855
That they were
never invited into.

1137
00:53:10,955 --> 00:53:12,857
That's the problem.

1138
00:53:12,957 --> 00:53:14,592
I think that's the problem.

1139
00:53:14,692 --> 00:53:16,126
[Applause]

1140
00:53:18,963 --> 00:53:23,501
I just hope that Democrats
will evolve on the pot issue

1141
00:53:23,601 --> 00:53:25,870
As quickly as they did
on the gay marriage issue

1142
00:53:25,970 --> 00:53:29,874
Because I notice... which is
to say not very quickly at all...

1143
00:53:29,974 --> 00:53:34,111
But as soon as gay marriage
hit 51% approval in the polls,

1144
00:53:34,211 --> 00:53:36,881
Ooh, there was
a lot of evolving on it.

1145
00:53:36,981 --> 00:53:39,650
Suddenly... ha ha!

1146
00:53:39,750 --> 00:53:42,553
And I notice a lot
of them use the same excuse,

1147
00:53:42,653 --> 00:53:46,724
Which was, "Well, you know
my kids have gay friends",

1148
00:53:46,824 --> 00:53:48,192
"And we had them over
to dinner.

1149
00:53:48,293 --> 00:53:51,729
"It was lovely and none
of them leapt across the table

1150
00:53:51,829 --> 00:53:53,230
"And tried to have
anal sex with me.

1151
00:53:53,331 --> 00:53:55,433
So I guess it's all good
on the gay thing."

1152
00:53:58,803 --> 00:54:00,938
Well, don't hold
your breath for that.

1153
00:54:01,038 --> 00:54:02,507
I'll say
this for the Republicans,

1154
00:54:02,607 --> 00:54:04,041
Republicans make polls.

1155
00:54:04,141 --> 00:54:05,843
Democrats run from polls.

1156
00:54:05,943 --> 00:54:08,145
The repeal of...
[Audience member applauds]

1157
00:54:08,245 --> 00:54:11,015
Thank you, one person.

1158
00:54:11,115 --> 00:54:14,184
The repeal of don't ask,
don't tell in the military

1159
00:54:14,285 --> 00:54:17,254
Was polling at 75% approval.

1160
00:54:17,355 --> 00:54:19,189
That's super-high in America.

1161
00:54:19,290 --> 00:54:22,860
Nope. Democrats still
needed to do one more study

1162
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:24,629
To cover their ass.

1163
00:54:24,729 --> 00:54:28,699
So they did a study to find out
whether having gays in the ranks

1164
00:54:28,799 --> 00:54:32,236
Would impede readiness.

1165
00:54:32,337 --> 00:54:33,404
[Scattered laughter]

1166
00:54:33,504 --> 00:54:36,541
Yeah, exactly.
How do you even study this?

1167
00:54:36,641 --> 00:54:39,544
"Uh, Johnson,
get in here and blow me..."

1168
00:54:41,979 --> 00:54:45,916
"While I fire this rifle
at those targets down there."

1169
00:54:47,985 --> 00:54:49,153
"Let me dig in here."

1170
00:54:49,253 --> 00:54:51,489
[Clears throat]

1171
00:54:51,589 --> 00:54:53,391
"And then
we will repeat the experiment

1172
00:54:53,491 --> 00:54:55,460
When you're not blowing me."

1173
00:54:58,496 --> 00:55:00,531
"And we'll see if it
impedes readiness, all right?

1174
00:55:00,631 --> 00:55:02,166
"Here we go.

1175
00:55:02,266 --> 00:55:04,702
"A little to the left.

1176
00:55:04,802 --> 00:55:06,671
No, not you. You're perfect."

1177
00:55:06,771 --> 00:55:08,839
[Laughter]

1178
00:55:08,939 --> 00:55:10,174
Really?

1179
00:55:10,274 --> 00:55:12,209
[Applause]

1180
00:55:15,179 --> 00:55:16,313
[Chuckles]

1181
00:55:16,414 --> 00:55:20,985
I have to ask, how come
it is that in the military

1182
00:55:21,085 --> 00:55:26,691
And the clergy, they talk
about homosexuality like it's

1183
00:55:26,791 --> 00:55:30,895
This thing that if you're around
it at all, you will be tempted.

1184
00:55:32,296 --> 00:55:35,366
I mean, I've been
in show business my whole life.

1185
00:55:35,466 --> 00:55:37,201
I'm around it.

1186
00:55:37,301 --> 00:55:39,203
I was never tempted.

1187
00:55:39,303 --> 00:55:42,039
I never walked into a wardrobe
trailer and went,

1188
00:55:42,139 --> 00:55:43,273
"Ah!"

1189
00:55:43,374 --> 00:55:45,042
[Laughter]

1190
00:55:45,142 --> 00:55:47,211
"I bet I could fuck
a lot of the guys in here."

1191
00:55:47,311 --> 00:55:48,713
Because I don't fuck guys.

1192
00:55:48,813 --> 00:55:52,049
But somehow in the military
and the clergy,

1193
00:55:52,149 --> 00:55:56,220
It's like dessert
at a fine restaurant. Just...

1194
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:58,389
"Oh, don't put that in front
of me."

1195
00:55:58,489 --> 00:55:59,824
[Laughter]

1196
00:55:59,924 --> 00:56:02,827
[Applause]

1197
00:56:02,927 --> 00:56:06,196
"Oh, you're bad. No! No."

1198
00:56:08,933 --> 00:56:10,735
"Well, I haven't sucked
any all week.

1199
00:56:10,835 --> 00:56:12,537
I suppose I could have one."

1200
00:56:17,107 --> 00:56:20,110
And, you know, whenever you
see a Congressman or a clergyman

1201
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:22,513
Get caught with a young
boy, I notice

1202
00:56:22,613 --> 00:56:26,250
That the go-to first excuse
to let everybody down easy is

1203
00:56:26,350 --> 00:56:29,086
Always the words,
"I am not a perfect man."

1204
00:56:29,186 --> 00:56:31,856
If you hear
"I am not a perfect man,"

1205
00:56:31,956 --> 00:56:34,592
Just put the cock
in his mouth right there.

1206
00:56:34,692 --> 00:56:38,228
[Muffled]
"I am not a perfect man."

1207
00:56:38,328 --> 00:56:39,797
[Chuckles]

1208
00:56:39,897 --> 00:56:44,869
"But I'm not gay. Oh, come on!
Where'd you get this shit?"

1209
00:56:44,969 --> 00:56:47,872
"Honey, am I gay?
Do I do anything gay?"

1210
00:56:47,972 --> 00:56:49,874
[Laughter]

1211
00:56:49,974 --> 00:56:53,043
Don't you feel bad for
the wife in a sex scandal,

1212
00:56:53,143 --> 00:56:56,346
Although I actually think the
age of the sex scandal is over

1213
00:56:56,447 --> 00:57:00,217
Because the technology we have
between "TMZ" and the NSA,

1214
00:57:00,317 --> 00:57:01,919
Nobody can get away
with anything.

1215
00:57:02,019 --> 00:57:05,656
Look at poor Anthony Weiner.
He never even got laid.

1216
00:57:05,756 --> 00:57:06,991
[Laughter]

1217
00:57:07,091 --> 00:57:09,159
He was just
typing and masturbating

1218
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:13,330
And typing and masturbating,
and happily.

1219
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:16,667
You know, sometimes these women
would write back to him and say,

1220
00:57:16,767 --> 00:57:19,169
"We could make this happen
for real,"

1221
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:20,805
And he'd be like, "Ew."

1222
00:57:20,905 --> 00:57:22,840
[Laughter]

1223
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:24,208
"What do you mean, 'for real'?
How gross!

1224
00:57:24,308 --> 00:57:25,710
"You mean I touch you? No!

1225
00:57:25,810 --> 00:57:29,346
I'm typing and masturbating
and typing and masturbating."

1226
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:31,348
This must be
a generational thing, honestly.

1227
00:57:31,448 --> 00:57:35,686
I don't associate
typing with sex.

1228
00:57:35,786 --> 00:57:37,522
I associate typing

1229
00:57:37,622 --> 00:57:39,690
With term papers
that are due the next day.

1230
00:57:39,790 --> 00:57:41,859
That's what
I associate typing with.

1231
00:57:41,959 --> 00:57:44,028
[Applause]

1232
00:57:44,128 --> 00:57:47,565
But it's certainly not
the case, as so many people say,

1233
00:57:47,665 --> 00:57:49,667
That they're hornier now...
More now than ever.

1234
00:57:49,767 --> 00:57:51,035
They're not hornier
more than ever.

1235
00:57:51,135 --> 00:57:52,737
Kennedy was hornier than any...

1236
00:57:52,837 --> 00:57:56,040
The founding fathers were
the horniest generation of all.

1237
00:57:56,140 --> 00:57:58,042
It's just that they
couldn't get caught back then.

1238
00:57:58,142 --> 00:58:00,545
There was no way you could
send a picture of your penis

1239
00:58:00,645 --> 00:58:02,647
To a woman.

1240
00:58:02,747 --> 00:58:06,584
I mean, you could but you
had to sit for a dick portrait.

1241
00:58:06,684 --> 00:58:08,619
[Laughter]

1242
00:58:16,594 --> 00:58:20,497
"Yeah, a little to the left,
Mr. President. Thank you."

1243
00:58:20,598 --> 00:58:22,833
You'd have to frame it
and put it on a carriage.

1244
00:58:22,933 --> 00:58:25,169
It was a... well, you know.

1245
00:58:25,269 --> 00:58:27,504
But this is the age we live in.

1246
00:58:27,605 --> 00:58:29,339
People put their shit up online.

1247
00:58:29,439 --> 00:58:30,841
We've seen
Anthony Weiner's penis.

1248
00:58:30,941 --> 00:58:33,177
We're going to see
a president's penis someday.

1249
00:58:33,277 --> 00:58:36,547
This is why
I am so for circumcision.

1250
00:58:36,647 --> 00:58:39,850
You know, th...
[Scattered cheers]

1251
00:58:39,950 --> 00:58:42,687
There is this movement to get
rid of circumcision.

1252
00:58:42,787 --> 00:58:45,522
Oh, people hate it. "It's child
abuse and genital mutilation"

1253
00:58:45,623 --> 00:58:47,457
And it's desecration
of the human flesh."

1254
00:58:47,558 --> 00:58:49,426
Whatever! I am for it.

1255
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:52,529
And if everybody's gonna put
their junk online...

1256
00:58:52,630 --> 00:58:55,566
Anything that makes
a penis look less like something

1257
00:58:55,666 --> 00:58:57,334
That lives in the ocean...

1258
00:58:57,434 --> 00:59:00,270
[Laughter]

1259
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:04,474
Should be applauded, encouraged,
and federally funded.

1260
00:59:04,575 --> 00:59:08,112
I will be in your office
tomorrow looking for funding.

1261
00:59:08,212 --> 00:59:10,480
Thank you very much,
ladies and gentlemen.

1262
00:59:10,581 --> 00:59:11,982
You were an awesome crowd.

1263
00:59:12,082 --> 00:59:13,550
I thank you for coming out,

1264
00:59:13,651 --> 00:59:16,821
Waiting for me to arrive,
the whole 9 yards.

1265
00:59:16,921 --> 00:59:18,823
Thank you, HBO and our staff,

1266
00:59:18,923 --> 00:59:20,591
And everybody here
in Washington.

1267
00:59:20,691 --> 00:59:22,492
It was so great. Thank you!

1268
00:59:22,593 --> 00:59:24,261
[Cheering and applause]

1269
00:59:24,361 --> 00:59:27,698
*

1270
00:59:27,798 --> 00:59:29,333
MAN: Real...

1271
00:59:29,433 --> 00:59:32,637
[Cheering continues]
