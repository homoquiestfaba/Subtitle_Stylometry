1
00:00:25,024 --> 00:00:26,425
Well, just great!

2
00:00:26,492 --> 00:00:28,995
No, not the presentation.
That's terrible.

3
00:00:29,062 --> 00:00:30,696
Some idiot just hit me.

4
00:00:30,763 --> 00:00:34,567
Do you realize how much
this is going to cost?

5
00:00:34,634 --> 00:00:37,936
Not in money, which
I have plenty of, but in...

6
00:00:40,106 --> 00:00:41,307
What the...

7
00:00:42,142 --> 00:00:44,677
Get away from me! Get away!

8
00:00:50,281 --> 00:00:51,917
Help me. Someone help!

9
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:56,354
Stay away!

10
00:00:56,421 --> 00:00:58,623
What are you doing?

11
00:01:08,268 --> 00:01:09,802
-Look out!
-Help me!

12
00:01:21,513 --> 00:01:25,217
Wonder Woman! Save me!
Save me from them!

13
00:01:25,284 --> 00:01:26,686
From whom?

14
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:29,588
Demons. They're everywhere.
Don't you see them?

15
00:01:39,831 --> 00:01:41,366
I see only one.

16
00:01:50,676 --> 00:01:52,778
I'll ask you
one last time.

17
00:01:54,046 --> 00:01:55,581
What did you do
with my family?

18
00:01:56,581 --> 00:02:01,719
Steven, it's me, Gloria!
I'm your wife.

19
00:02:01,787 --> 00:02:03,590
These are our children.

20
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:07,358
You're not my family!

21
00:02:07,426 --> 00:02:10,663
You killed them,
just like the others.

22
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:11,863
Now it's your turn.

23
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:19,604
No one's dying here tonight.

24
00:02:19,671 --> 00:02:22,007
It's not me
you should be stopping.

25
00:02:22,074 --> 00:02:23,809
It's them. Look at them!

26
00:02:27,346 --> 00:02:28,347
Look at them!

27
00:02:35,687 --> 00:02:37,522
It's just like the neighbors.

28
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:40,159
Go to my shed.
You'll see I'm right!

29
00:02:58,243 --> 00:02:59,645
What have you done?

30
00:03:25,069 --> 00:03:26,072
Let me help you.

31
00:03:28,174 --> 00:03:29,808
It's not my fault.

32
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:33,612
I've given birth to the devil.
It's the devil!

33
00:03:36,414 --> 00:03:38,516
You're tired.
Give me the baby.

34
00:03:38,584 --> 00:03:40,286
You don't want to hurt her.

35
00:04:14,887 --> 00:04:15,921
I'm sorry.

36
00:04:44,716 --> 00:04:47,920
These crimes were committed
by law-abiding citizens.

37
00:04:47,987 --> 00:04:51,189
They all claim to have seen
nightmare visions beforehand.

38
00:04:51,257 --> 00:04:52,891
Any clue what's causing it?

39
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:53,959
No idea.

40
00:04:55,261 --> 00:04:56,629
The one week
I fill in for Jordan,

41
00:04:56,696 --> 00:04:58,564
and it couldn't be
some hairy-ass monster?

42
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:01,300
The same pattern is repeating
around the world,

43
00:05:01,367 --> 00:05:03,335
so there could be
an overriding factor.

44
00:05:03,401 --> 00:05:05,538
Perhaps a paranormal element.

45
00:05:05,605 --> 00:05:08,374
Are you talking about magic?

46
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,575
We've come up against
magic before, Batman.

47
00:05:10,642 --> 00:05:12,544
Xerxes, Trigon, Felix Faust.

48
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:15,046
Even Shazam's powers
are based in magic.

49
00:05:15,113 --> 00:05:17,849
With as much as you've seen,
can you rule it out?

50
00:05:17,915 --> 00:05:21,387
The criminally insane
don't need magic as an excuse.

51
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:23,723
I recommend spending
more time on the streets

52
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,491
instead of flying over them.

53
00:05:26,992 --> 00:05:30,028
He's even friendlier
than they say.

54
00:06:52,278 --> 00:06:57,617
Bollocks! In what bloody plane of
existence does four of a kind lose?

55
00:06:58,483 --> 00:07:01,920
Too, too bad, Constantine.

56
00:07:03,221 --> 00:07:07,925
Have you gained weight?
It looks good on you.

57
00:07:07,992 --> 00:07:11,062
What say you let your soul
mate play a few hands, Jason?

58
00:07:11,129 --> 00:07:12,598
Maybe he'd change my luck.

59
00:07:12,665 --> 00:07:14,500
He'd definitely be
less mopey than you.

60
00:07:14,565 --> 00:07:19,236
John Constantine, the man
who perfected the bad idea.

61
00:07:19,303 --> 00:07:22,908
The only reason I came to this dung
heap of a casino is to find a relic

62
00:07:22,975 --> 00:07:25,211
to keep that monster
locked away forever.

63
00:07:25,276 --> 00:07:29,048
Boys, boys! You're boring me.
Let's play, shall we?

64
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:50,668
My luck's running
as hot as me naughty bits.

65
00:07:50,735 --> 00:07:53,404
But our next group
of friends is due to arrive,

66
00:07:53,471 --> 00:07:55,942
so it's time to bust you out.

67
00:07:56,007 --> 00:08:00,111
Copperfield's coming.
Presto changeo!

68
00:08:00,177 --> 00:08:03,281
Woman in a box. In a box.

69
00:08:03,348 --> 00:08:06,617
Yeah, he's classy, unlike you.

70
00:08:06,685 --> 00:08:11,756
Are they implying David Copperfield,
television magician, has true power?

71
00:08:11,822 --> 00:08:15,961
Owns a chain of islands and dated
Claudia Schiffer. What do you think?

72
00:08:19,497 --> 00:08:20,998
No cards for me, and...

73
00:08:21,065 --> 00:08:25,170
Looks like you can't call
my bet, Constantine.

74
00:08:25,237 --> 00:08:27,573
By my rules, you lose.

75
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,641
I raise.

76
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:32,677
With what? Your ratty soul
ain't worth two bits.

77
00:08:32,745 --> 00:08:34,179
Not two bits.

78
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:39,085
I'm betting the House,
the House of Mystery.

79
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:46,925
And since I'm including
everything inside,

80
00:08:46,991 --> 00:08:49,861
it looks like you're the one
that can't call, Abnegazar.

81
00:08:50,996 --> 00:08:53,464
Well, what do you say, boys?

82
00:08:53,532 --> 00:08:55,735
I like the action.

83
00:09:10,282 --> 00:09:11,617
I call.

84
00:09:16,355 --> 00:09:18,624
Really? A chipped Dreamstone?

85
00:09:19,024 --> 00:09:21,393
I'm out.

86
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:24,530
Broken knick-knacks for the House
of Mystery and its contents?

87
00:09:24,596 --> 00:09:25,730
Are you mad?

88
00:09:25,798 --> 00:09:28,933
I've got a working
soul catcher.

89
00:09:29,999 --> 00:09:33,338
That's Ogid's Eye Spiker?
And the Garazi.

90
00:09:33,405 --> 00:09:39,444
So even if that very magical Dreamstone
doesn't work, it's still a big-ass ruby.

91
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:43,315
I'd be a poor sport indeed if I
didn't accept your fair wager.

92
00:09:51,089 --> 00:09:54,593
Hell. Now, that's
a losing hand for the ages.

93
00:09:54,658 --> 00:09:57,663
Now, read them and...

94
00:09:58,464 --> 00:09:59,631
What?

95
00:09:59,697 --> 00:10:01,933
Do they have
an eye doctor in hell?

96
00:10:02,999 --> 00:10:04,269
I'd make an appointment
if I was you.

97
00:10:04,336 --> 00:10:06,004
You cheated!

98
00:10:09,407 --> 00:10:12,845
Technically, we both cheated.
I just did it better.

99
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:14,846
I'll rip
your bloody heart out!

100
00:10:14,913 --> 00:10:17,048
Sorry, mate, I'm using that.

101
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,603
Situation here, Jason. It's
time to call your better half.

102
00:10:37,669 --> 00:10:40,305
Sorry, John,
you're on your own.

103
00:10:49,581 --> 00:10:54,253
Oi, I'm gonna roast your nuts and
feed them to you, Constantine.

104
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:04,996
Gone, gone, the form of man.

105
00:11:05,062 --> 00:11:08,734
Arise the demon, Etrigan!

106
00:11:11,803 --> 00:11:15,240
Once more with words
of metered rhyme

107
00:11:15,307 --> 00:11:19,278
comes Etrigan the Slayer
just in time.

108
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:22,681
Easy now, brother.
We're on the same side, right?

109
00:11:22,748 --> 00:11:25,317
Let's use our words.

110
00:11:25,384 --> 00:11:28,486
Are you having a laugh?
We're the Demons Three.

111
00:11:28,553 --> 00:11:30,221
Kill everyone!

112
00:11:40,631 --> 00:11:42,667
You will pay, Constantine.

113
00:11:42,735 --> 00:11:45,403
Your soul will be ours.

114
00:11:45,471 --> 00:11:47,072
Get in line, you prats.

115
00:11:59,116 --> 00:12:00,951
Your ass is grass,
Constantine.

116
00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:04,222
And we're the lawnmower.

117
00:12:05,756 --> 00:12:08,726
Since the battle's
fought and won,

118
00:12:08,793 --> 00:12:11,797
Jason Blood with me is done.

119
00:12:21,606 --> 00:12:24,475
For 500 years,
I've been bound to Etrigan,

120
00:12:24,543 --> 00:12:26,812
fighting to keep him
from coming forth,

121
00:12:26,878 --> 00:12:29,014
and you forced me
to summon him.

122
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,216
Everything got sorted.

123
00:12:31,283 --> 00:12:33,317
He could have gone
on a killing spree.

124
00:12:33,384 --> 00:12:36,822
You don't think.
You don't consider the cost.

125
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:38,923
Yeah, I did.

126
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:42,026
Weighed it against my being eaten alive
and thought, "Yeah, totally worth it."

127
00:12:44,296 --> 00:12:46,999
You're a world class
bastard, John.

128
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:16,127
And for my finale,

129
00:13:16,193 --> 00:13:23,067
I will make this terrible trio of
terrifying Tantors vanish before your eyes.

130
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:52,029
I hope
those elephants survived.

131
00:13:52,096 --> 00:13:54,533
You don't want
PETA on your back.

132
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,369
You're assuming they were
real in the first place.

133
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:00,739
How are you, Bruce?

134
00:14:00,806 --> 00:14:03,108
I'm fine, Zatanna. Busy.

135
00:14:03,174 --> 00:14:05,977
You know where I can find
John Constantine?

136
00:14:06,378 --> 00:14:07,612
No.

137
00:14:07,678 --> 00:14:09,079
You must have some idea.

138
00:14:09,147 --> 00:14:10,916
We don't keep in touch.

139
00:14:10,982 --> 00:14:13,350
I know
you two have history, so I...

140
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:20,058
Z, Batman needs
to talk with John.

141
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:22,427
You've got to come along, too.
It's important.

142
00:14:22,494 --> 00:14:23,927
Is that you, Boston?

143
00:14:23,995 --> 00:14:25,197
Yeah.

144
00:14:25,263 --> 00:14:27,098
Everything is...

145
00:14:27,164 --> 00:14:28,600
Boy, this guy's mind is tough.

146
00:14:30,999 --> 00:14:31,937
Can't hold...

147
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:37,442
What is going on?

148
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:40,178
I'll tell you
on the way to John's.

149
00:14:41,846 --> 00:14:43,581
Okay, but I call shotgun.

150
00:14:48,452 --> 00:14:50,254
I don't even think his kid
could fit back here.

151
00:14:50,322 --> 00:14:52,625
Sorry, Boston,
but life is for the living.

152
00:14:52,691 --> 00:14:55,627
Boston Brand.
He was a circus performer.

153
00:14:55,692 --> 00:14:59,965
Batman's heard of me. Sweet.
Tell him I'm a fan of his, too,

154
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:02,367
but, you know,
be cool about it.

155
00:15:02,933 --> 00:15:04,435
Yeah, that's him.

156
00:15:04,503 --> 00:15:06,504
Ask him
if he caught one of my shows.

157
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:09,707
He was a trapeze artist
who loved being famous,

158
00:15:09,774 --> 00:15:11,876
especially with the ladies.

159
00:15:11,942 --> 00:15:13,912
Husbands, not so much.

160
00:15:13,979 --> 00:15:15,379
You're killing me.

161
00:15:15,447 --> 00:15:17,982
He had a knack for irritating
the wrong people.

162
00:15:18,049 --> 00:15:21,718
<i>Then, about five years ago,
karma caught up with him.</i>

163
00:15:25,389 --> 00:15:28,526
<i>It was a weekend show,
full house.</i>

164
00:15:28,592 --> 00:15:32,630
<i>Boston was in the middle of
his death-defying act when...</i>

165
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:02,394
<i>He died, and that
should have been that,</i>

166
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:07,432
<i>but with Boston, things
tend to get complicated.</i>

167
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:12,637
<i>His spirit was called
by the goddess Rama Kushna.</i>

168
00:16:12,703 --> 00:16:16,607
<i>She took pity on him and gave him
the power to possess the living,</i>

169
00:16:16,674 --> 00:16:19,544
so he could bring his killer
and others to justice.

170
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:21,580
Hey, I don't wanna brag,
but I'm good.

171
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:24,583
Why did he feel the need to
write on my walls like a child?

172
00:16:24,649 --> 00:16:26,684
Yeah,
he's sorry about that.

173
00:16:29,052 --> 00:16:30,455
Where is this address?

174
00:16:30,522 --> 00:16:33,592
GPS doesn't seem
especially useful tonight.

175
00:16:33,658 --> 00:16:37,596
It's not an address. The House
of Mystery tends to move around.

176
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:41,600
I didn't put the symbols in
there for the GPS to find it.

177
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:44,035
I wanted the House
to come to us.

178
00:17:37,489 --> 00:17:39,758
She can't hold it.
Do something.

179
00:17:57,809 --> 00:17:58,810
There.

180
00:18:05,616 --> 00:18:06,718
Into the House!

181
00:18:19,297 --> 00:18:20,464
Z, you all right?

182
00:18:20,531 --> 00:18:23,234
Yeah, as soon
as you get off me.

183
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,635
I should have known
you were the reason

184
00:18:24,702 --> 00:18:27,105
I'm not back
in London enjoying a pint.

185
00:18:27,172 --> 00:18:30,075
The House always
did like you better.

186
00:18:30,141 --> 00:18:32,410
Odd trio for a road trip.

187
00:18:32,477 --> 00:18:34,479
To what do I owe the visit?

188
00:18:34,545 --> 00:18:37,816
The League thinks that a recent spike
in homicides may have a magical cause.

189
00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:42,688
Told you something stinks.

190
00:18:42,753 --> 00:18:45,722
Now we know someone doesn't
want us asking questions.

191
00:18:45,789 --> 00:18:48,292
Looks like you've cracked it
wide open, mate.

192
00:18:48,359 --> 00:18:49,760
What did he say?

193
00:18:49,827 --> 00:18:52,230
I'm not playing
telephone between you two.

194
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,603
We online?

195
00:18:58,769 --> 00:19:00,971
Great.
Sorry about the Batmobile.

196
00:19:01,038 --> 00:19:03,674
I hope your insurance
was paid up.

197
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,942
What, is there even a policy
for something like that?

198
00:19:09,647 --> 00:19:12,583
Hey, I told you not to do that,
Orchid. Use a bloody door.

199
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:15,952
I am glad to see you are well.

200
00:19:17,288 --> 00:19:18,855
How new is this one?

201
00:19:18,923 --> 00:19:20,959
Not what you think.

202
00:19:21,026 --> 00:19:22,960
It's the magic of the House.

203
00:19:23,027 --> 00:19:27,164
Decided it wanted to experience
humanity and gave itself a body.

204
00:19:27,231 --> 00:19:28,834
It sure did.

205
00:19:30,434 --> 00:19:35,706
A spirit whose existence
is not its own, like myself.

206
00:19:35,773 --> 00:19:37,475
Interesting.

207
00:19:37,541 --> 00:19:42,846
Um, yeah, we are that.

208
00:19:42,913 --> 00:19:45,450
Dead smooth you are, mate.

209
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:48,187
Hey, it's been a while,
you know?

210
00:19:50,588 --> 00:19:55,726
Powerful in true magic.
Angry at John.

211
00:19:55,794 --> 00:19:58,630
This, I understand.

212
00:19:58,696 --> 00:20:02,500
Yet you still have
feelings for him.

213
00:20:03,768 --> 00:20:05,504
I could kill him.

214
00:20:12,943 --> 00:20:14,945
You exude pain.

215
00:20:15,012 --> 00:20:20,283
Your life is a patchwork of
blackness with no time for joy.

216
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:22,688
How do you cope with it?

217
00:20:24,355 --> 00:20:26,391
I have a butler.

218
00:20:29,559 --> 00:20:31,462
That was enlightening.

219
00:20:34,632 --> 00:20:36,969
Well, I guess we should have
that chinwag about now.

220
00:20:40,637 --> 00:20:42,240
<i>- Demons!
- It's not me!</i>

221
00:20:44,643 --> 00:20:48,246
<i>I've given birth to the devil.
It's the...</i>

222
00:20:48,311 --> 00:20:51,682
Rama Kushna says this will break
down the walls between the planes.

223
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,719
Even the afterlife
will be affected.

224
00:20:53,785 --> 00:20:56,954
Yeah, it's dodgy, all right.
I'll look into it.

225
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:59,057
Meanwhile, the House will
drop you wherever you'd like.

226
00:20:59,124 --> 00:21:02,227
Rama says
we have to work together.

227
00:21:02,294 --> 00:21:04,028
Come on! It's a dream team.

228
00:21:04,095 --> 00:21:07,598
You, me, Zatanna, Batman,
maybe even the Justice League.

229
00:21:07,665 --> 00:21:11,869
The capes and tights crew,
useless against dark magic.

230
00:21:11,935 --> 00:21:15,173
That's why we need you.
You can lead us.

231
00:21:15,239 --> 00:21:19,978
Boston, do I strike you as a team
player? Much less a team leader.

232
00:21:20,044 --> 00:21:23,114
Point is,
even deities can get it wrong.

233
00:21:23,181 --> 00:21:26,985
It's how we got the appendix,
Neanderthals and reality TV.

234
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:29,287
Z, your help I could use.

235
00:21:29,354 --> 00:21:32,355
Okay, if we do it as a group.

236
00:21:32,423 --> 00:21:37,496
This is the monkey cage
in Sumatra all over again.

237
00:21:37,561 --> 00:21:40,063
"We need to save
the monkeys," she said.

238
00:21:40,131 --> 00:21:42,500
You're such an ass.

239
00:21:42,567 --> 00:21:44,602
Not the monkeys.

240
00:21:44,669 --> 00:21:48,506
Says the man who has Newcastle and
100 other screw-ups on his resume,

241
00:21:48,573 --> 00:21:50,441
costing lives and souls.

242
00:21:50,508 --> 00:21:52,611
But not monkeys. You're still
way ahead on dead monkeys.

243
00:21:52,676 --> 00:21:54,778
They used to be a thing.

244
00:21:54,846 --> 00:21:56,079
You just have
to make things...

245
00:21:56,146 --> 00:21:57,515
We're wasting time.

246
00:21:58,982 --> 00:22:00,684
He's dead,
and I accept the risks,

247
00:22:00,751 --> 00:22:04,923
so can we get to it,
or do you two need a timeout?

248
00:22:07,959 --> 00:22:11,863
Fine and dandy. Let's take a
walk on the dark side then.

249
00:22:15,333 --> 00:22:16,835
Coming, team?

250
00:22:22,906 --> 00:22:25,009
Stop being a child
and slow down.

251
00:22:25,076 --> 00:22:26,478
Where are we going?

252
00:22:26,978 --> 00:22:28,346
Ritchie's.

253
00:22:28,413 --> 00:22:29,913
Have you talked to him lately?

254
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:32,516
I know he's pissed. You
don't have to remind me, love.

255
00:22:32,583 --> 00:22:34,152
It's on my CV, remember?

256
00:22:34,219 --> 00:22:37,588
No, really, has he told you...

257
00:22:39,391 --> 00:22:42,794
No. He's dying.

258
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:44,963
John Constantine,

259
00:22:45,029 --> 00:22:51,001
purveyor of the dark arts
and lifeline of last resort.

260
00:22:51,068 --> 00:22:56,973
No matter. Your friend's soul
will be collected,

261
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:01,311
and there's nothing you can do
to alter that.

262
00:23:01,378 --> 00:23:05,548
Why don't you go do something
useful, like haunt a house?

263
00:23:05,615 --> 00:23:06,984
Who's he talking to now?

264
00:23:07,051 --> 00:23:10,388
Shrouds.
They deliver souls to hell.

265
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:14,759
They're drawn to you.

266
00:23:14,826 --> 00:23:17,929
Maybe it's your cologne,
Batsy.

267
00:23:17,996 --> 00:23:21,999
This one has cheated us
many times.

268
00:23:22,066 --> 00:23:24,102
It is vexing.

269
00:23:27,872 --> 00:23:29,440
Boo.

270
00:23:29,507 --> 00:23:33,310
This has been lovely, but it's
time for you lot to bugger off.

271
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:40,084
When the time comes, I'll be the one
to collect your soul, Constantine.

272
00:23:40,151 --> 00:23:41,653
Yeah, yeah.

273
00:23:44,388 --> 00:23:47,658
I thought I felt
a disturbance in the force.

274
00:23:49,292 --> 00:23:51,495
How you doing, Johnny boy?

275
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:56,634
Zatanna and Batman?

276
00:23:57,468 --> 00:23:59,837
What the hell?

277
00:23:59,903 --> 00:24:02,773
Tell you
everything inside, mate.

278
00:24:10,347 --> 00:24:12,416
You poor thing.

279
00:24:12,483 --> 00:24:15,752
Yeah, I may have lied
the last time we talked,

280
00:24:15,819 --> 00:24:19,656
about exactly how fast
I'm sledding downhill.

281
00:24:19,722 --> 00:24:21,192
I'm sorry about that.

282
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:25,030
But it means
a lot you're here, John.

283
00:24:25,096 --> 00:24:30,134
And, hey, you don't have
to say it. You're forgiven.

284
00:24:30,201 --> 00:24:33,137
Still wondering what Batman's
doing in my living room.

285
00:24:33,204 --> 00:24:35,806
And when is he
gonna shut up, right?

286
00:24:37,474 --> 00:24:39,944
What? What's with the face?

287
00:24:41,645 --> 00:24:44,214
You're not here to say
you're sorry, are you?

288
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,782
Of course I am,

289
00:24:45,849 --> 00:24:49,386
but I was looking to borrow
the Keshanti Key as well.

290
00:24:49,453 --> 00:24:51,855
Unbelievable.

291
00:24:51,923 --> 00:24:54,192
I tried to tell him
on the way.

292
00:24:54,259 --> 00:24:55,826
Yeah, it's not your fault, Z.

293
00:24:55,893 --> 00:24:59,230
Just like everything, this is
rock star Johnny's fault.

294
00:24:59,297 --> 00:25:01,432
I was with you
when it happened, Ritchie.

295
00:25:01,499 --> 00:25:03,335
We were side by side.

296
00:25:03,401 --> 00:25:05,303
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
side by side.

297
00:25:05,369 --> 00:25:10,240
But I got the weird magical cancer
while you, you added to your rep.

298
00:25:10,307 --> 00:25:12,042
Isn't that right?

299
00:25:12,108 --> 00:25:14,912
Look, me not making proper
amends isn't related to the Key,

300
00:25:14,979 --> 00:25:17,949
which, truth be told,
you're not gonna need, mate.

301
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:19,050
John!

302
00:25:25,355 --> 00:25:26,924
Getting that a lot lately.

303
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:30,127
You can go screw yourself.
I am not giving you crap.

304
00:25:30,194 --> 00:25:33,364
Your anger is understandable,
but you need to reconsider.

305
00:25:33,431 --> 00:25:35,834
Innocent lives are at stake.

306
00:25:47,077 --> 00:25:50,346
Well, doctors say
an upbeat attitude can help,

307
00:25:50,413 --> 00:25:55,353
so what I'll focus on today
is that I met Batman.

308
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:56,888
Force of good.

309
00:25:56,954 --> 00:26:00,490
It was also nice
seeing you, Zatanna.

310
00:26:00,557 --> 00:26:02,826
Now, if you'll excuse me...

311
00:26:06,397 --> 00:26:08,699
You can show yourselves out.

312
00:26:33,057 --> 00:26:34,659
This him?

313
00:26:35,893 --> 00:26:40,198
Father of the year.
I'll need the gear now.

314
00:26:42,365 --> 00:26:43,634
How does this work?

315
00:26:43,701 --> 00:26:45,803
It's basically
a magical shortcut.

316
00:26:45,869 --> 00:26:47,738
It lets me access
different planes of existence

317
00:26:47,806 --> 00:26:49,908
without doing 20-odd hours
of incantations.

318
00:26:49,973 --> 00:26:55,079
In this case, I'll poke around this poor
sod's memories to see how his madness began

319
00:26:57,382 --> 00:27:00,719
and, more importantly,
what caused it.

320
00:27:02,286 --> 00:27:05,090
What are you doing here?
I'm calling security.

321
00:27:08,025 --> 00:27:11,096
I'll make sure the looky-loos
stay out of our hair.

322
00:27:12,696 --> 00:27:16,667
Z, give me a psychic shout if
this body comes under attack.

323
00:27:16,733 --> 00:27:18,269
Wouldn't do to be trapped
inside, now.

324
00:27:18,336 --> 00:27:21,838
Wouldn't do to go in alone,
and since I'm right here...

325
00:27:21,905 --> 00:27:25,108
Too dangerous.
You're out of practice, love.

326
00:27:25,175 --> 00:27:27,778
Look, you wanted me along.
I'm here.

327
00:27:27,845 --> 00:27:31,048
I'm not waiting in the wings.
Let's do this.

328
00:27:57,708 --> 00:28:00,011
Z? You okay?

329
00:28:00,077 --> 00:28:01,680
I'm fine.

330
00:28:07,684 --> 00:28:10,287
I've never
liked this sort of magic.

331
00:28:10,354 --> 00:28:13,591
I can feel darkness seeping
inside me.

332
00:28:13,657 --> 00:28:15,692
How you stand it is beyond me.

333
00:28:15,759 --> 00:28:19,963
It's all about control. If
you ever need a refresher...

334
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:23,835
We've had this conversation.
I haven't changed my mind.

335
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:29,140
Sure, sit out the war
between good and evil.

336
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:33,277
After all, you've got a good thing going
being applauded by mindless twits.

337
00:28:33,344 --> 00:28:35,045
Really? Now?

338
00:28:35,112 --> 00:28:37,048
Good a time as ever, I reckon.

339
00:28:37,114 --> 00:28:40,817
- I'll teach you to talk back.
- No!

340
00:28:40,884 --> 00:28:44,154
The magic I perform
brings people happiness.

341
00:28:44,221 --> 00:28:46,624
You sure it's not
the two drink minimum, love?

342
00:28:46,691 --> 00:28:48,192
You're such a pessimist.

343
00:28:48,259 --> 00:28:52,229
Wrong. I expect the worst,
so I prepare for the worst,

344
00:28:52,296 --> 00:28:54,597
and when the worst happens,
I'm ready.

345
00:28:54,664 --> 00:28:58,235
But my outlook doesn't alter
the reality of the world.

346
00:28:58,301 --> 00:28:59,936
<i>Steven, stop!</i>

347
00:29:00,003 --> 00:29:01,404
<i>Leave me alone!</i>

348
00:29:01,471 --> 00:29:03,807
Another precious moment.

349
00:29:03,874 --> 00:29:06,043
There was joy, too.

350
00:29:06,109 --> 00:29:08,378
His madness swept it away.

351
00:29:47,884 --> 00:29:49,953
Who dropped the bed pan?

352
00:30:23,621 --> 00:30:26,757
This is it. This was the
morning of his madness.

353
00:30:26,824 --> 00:30:28,558
What do you think
will set him off?

354
00:30:28,625 --> 00:30:30,127
My guess is the Sudoku.

355
00:30:30,193 --> 00:30:32,696
He's got two 9s
in the same row.

356
00:30:32,763 --> 00:30:34,097
John.

357
00:30:43,973 --> 00:30:47,176
Run! Run! Run!

358
00:30:47,243 --> 00:30:49,613
Run! Let's get out of here!

359
00:30:54,718 --> 00:30:57,721
Come on, fellow.
Eat a piece of fruit?

360
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:09,300
Damn it!

361
00:32:07,692 --> 00:32:09,192
Here it is.

362
00:32:16,467 --> 00:32:18,036
We've got to get out of here.

363
00:32:20,336 --> 00:32:21,638
One more second.

364
00:32:24,342 --> 00:32:26,344
Now, John. There's no time.

365
00:32:33,017 --> 00:32:34,552
Got it.

366
00:32:58,808 --> 00:33:00,778
Shit's really hit the fan.

367
00:33:00,845 --> 00:33:03,346
You had to go there, Boston.

368
00:33:03,413 --> 00:33:05,182
Let's get the hell
out of here.

369
00:33:16,059 --> 00:33:18,395
-I don't recognize it.
-Me, neither.

370
00:33:18,461 --> 00:33:20,865
But if there's a person alive
who can, it's Ritchie.

371
00:33:20,931 --> 00:33:24,168
Are you forgetting when you
made your friend despise you?

372
00:33:24,233 --> 00:33:26,737
This is too bloody important
for hurt feelings.

373
00:33:33,277 --> 00:33:34,644
Constantine.

374
00:33:34,711 --> 00:33:36,446
Bollocks.

375
00:33:36,513 --> 00:33:38,782
You've arrived in time
to witness my...

376
00:33:40,817 --> 00:33:42,619
Ritchie!

377
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:48,558
Get back, you bastards!

378
00:33:48,625 --> 00:33:49,960
John, help Ritchie.

379
00:33:52,895 --> 00:33:54,365
Take that! Boom!

380
00:33:54,898 --> 00:33:55,898
No pulse.

381
00:33:55,965 --> 00:33:58,168
We know! We know! Come on!

382
00:34:12,817 --> 00:34:15,385
Why?

383
00:34:20,523 --> 00:34:23,025
I see you have
a few tricks of your own?

384
00:34:23,092 --> 00:34:25,128
Not everything requires magic.

385
00:34:41,344 --> 00:34:43,746
Make sure he sees that
right when he wakes up.

386
00:34:43,813 --> 00:34:45,348
If he wakes.

387
00:34:48,219 --> 00:34:50,052
We need to talk, you and I,

388
00:34:50,119 --> 00:34:52,289
but if you try
and summon Etrigan,

389
00:34:52,356 --> 00:34:55,660
I'll fill your lungs with bile
before the first verse is done.

390
00:34:56,561 --> 00:34:57,762
Savvy?

391
00:35:05,235 --> 00:35:07,337
The situation
was not how it seemed.

392
00:35:07,403 --> 00:35:11,442
The apartment was like that when
I arrived. Richard as well.

393
00:35:11,507 --> 00:35:13,009
Come on!
You were all over him.

394
00:35:13,076 --> 00:35:14,978
I was attempting to help.

395
00:35:15,045 --> 00:35:18,914
When you burst in, I knew
I'd get blamed, so I ran.

396
00:35:18,981 --> 00:35:20,150
Do you believe him?

397
00:35:20,217 --> 00:35:22,052
Jason's not the murdery type.

398
00:35:22,119 --> 00:35:26,190
He's chock full of honor, loyalty,
and rubbish of that sort.

399
00:35:26,257 --> 00:35:28,625
Then tell us
why you were there.

400
00:35:30,159 --> 00:35:33,396
Richard is known as a collector
of the arcane and supernatural.

401
00:35:33,463 --> 00:35:38,068
I wanted to see if he had something that
could gain me access to this place.

402
00:35:38,135 --> 00:35:40,204
Why would you
wanna break in here?

403
00:35:41,739 --> 00:35:43,407
For this.

404
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:47,577
The single most powerful conduit of
evil in the history of the world.

405
00:35:47,644 --> 00:35:50,514
He named it the Dreamstone,

406
00:35:50,581 --> 00:35:53,483
but it's really
the stuff of nightmares.

407
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:58,755
<i>I was a young knight,
green as grass.</i>

408
00:35:58,822 --> 00:36:02,693
<i>With visions of battle-won
glory dancing in my head.</i>

409
00:36:02,759 --> 00:36:07,465
<i>Needless to say, these
were dispelled thoroughly.</i>

410
00:36:08,565 --> 00:36:11,100
<i>He called himself Destiny,</i>

411
00:36:11,168 --> 00:36:15,072
<i>but Merlin told us he was a
man of science one time,</i>

412
00:36:15,139 --> 00:36:17,007
<i>before he went insane.</i>

413
00:36:17,074 --> 00:36:21,177
<i>Destiny forged the Dreamstone
with black magic and his soul.</i>

414
00:36:21,244 --> 00:36:25,147
<i>He used it to subject people to
their most terrifying nightmares</i>

415
00:36:25,215 --> 00:36:27,552
<i>and then feed off
their torment.</i>

416
00:37:39,088 --> 00:37:42,460
<i>It was actually the demon
Etrigan who won the day.</i>

417
00:37:45,329 --> 00:37:47,030
To battle, Etrigan.

418
00:37:47,097 --> 00:37:50,600
Should you succeed, I will
release you of your bond to me.

419
00:37:50,666 --> 00:37:53,402
If freedom is what's up
for trade,

420
00:37:53,469 --> 00:37:56,606
then Destiny's
as good as slayed.

421
00:38:30,673 --> 00:38:34,311
You haven't won, Merlin.
This isn't over.

422
00:38:34,378 --> 00:38:35,846
I swear it.

423
00:38:47,891 --> 00:38:50,527
Release me, Merlin,
from your care.

424
00:38:50,594 --> 00:38:54,432
My duty's done.
'Tis only fair.

425
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:57,900
I'm afraid that's not
possible, friend Demon.

426
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:07,810
I apologize to both you
and Jason Blood,

427
00:39:07,878 --> 00:39:12,416
but your future portends
a shared destiny.

428
00:39:14,751 --> 00:39:19,422
Caught now,
imprisoned in the form of man,

429
00:39:20,289 --> 00:39:23,893
I fix the demon, Etrigan.

430
00:39:36,039 --> 00:39:37,608
<i>It was also
the beginning</i>

431
00:39:37,673 --> 00:39:40,777
<i>of my eternal life sentence
with Etrigan.</i>

432
00:39:45,248 --> 00:39:47,317
I didn't think
you'd give it up willingly,

433
00:39:47,384 --> 00:39:50,253
and though this piece is useless
without the other half,

434
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,623
it's far from powerless.

435
00:39:53,289 --> 00:39:54,891
Safe enough where it is.

436
00:39:54,958 --> 00:39:57,994
Displayed like a tourist
trinket in a Karachi bazaar?

437
00:39:59,996 --> 00:40:01,097
Neat, isn't it?

438
00:40:01,164 --> 00:40:03,400
The House keeps
my valuables out of phase,

439
00:40:03,467 --> 00:40:05,202
so they don't go
wondering off.

440
00:40:05,268 --> 00:40:08,137
But, still, the timing of the Stone's
appearance and its power indicates

441
00:40:08,204 --> 00:40:10,873
that it's somehow involved
with these crimes.

442
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:14,610
Which is why it stays here,
where only I can get to it.

443
00:40:14,677 --> 00:40:18,949
I think me, them, and everyone else who knows
you might want it to be somewhere else.

444
00:40:20,382 --> 00:40:22,752
Your friend is awake.

445
00:40:25,021 --> 00:40:27,892
Ritchie, who was it?
Who did this to you?

446
00:40:29,092 --> 00:40:31,094
Faust.

447
00:40:31,161 --> 00:40:33,731
Felix Faust. You sure?

448
00:40:47,677 --> 00:40:49,445
There you are,
you old bastard.

449
00:40:49,512 --> 00:40:54,150
I give you wizard and asshole
extraordinaire, Felix Faust.

450
00:40:54,217 --> 00:40:55,786
Hell, I should have
put it together.

451
00:40:55,851 --> 00:40:58,755
Conjuring a whirlwind
is just his style.

452
00:41:00,856 --> 00:41:02,425
The League had
a run-in with Faust,

453
00:41:02,492 --> 00:41:04,661
but his location
isn't in our database.

454
00:41:04,728 --> 00:41:09,032
Yeah, well, wizards don't make a habit of
signing up for credit cards or social media.

455
00:41:09,099 --> 00:41:11,934
His grandly named Observatory
of the Cosmos is hidden

456
00:41:12,001 --> 00:41:15,539
from the likes of you
and Superman, but not from me.

457
00:41:19,108 --> 00:41:20,210
Felix Faust.

458
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:32,623
What's happening?

459
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:35,125
If this were a computer,
I'd say it's frozen.

460
00:41:36,059 --> 00:41:37,560
Cheers.

461
00:41:37,626 --> 00:41:41,663
Felix Faust would take precautions
against locator spells.

462
00:41:41,731 --> 00:41:43,900
There's another way,

463
00:41:43,967 --> 00:41:47,838
but it involves asking a favor of someone
that I don't have the best relationship with.

464
00:41:47,905 --> 00:41:51,242
Someone else dislikes you?
Shocking.

465
00:41:51,307 --> 00:41:54,110
Your friend slips
from the mortal plane.

466
00:41:54,177 --> 00:41:55,045
John...

467
00:41:55,112 --> 00:41:57,347
Keep him alive and safe.
Understand?

468
00:41:57,414 --> 00:41:59,282
That is not my purpose.

469
00:41:59,349 --> 00:42:02,486
I don't give a flying shag what
you think your bloody purpose is.

470
00:42:02,552 --> 00:42:05,722
I order you to help him
any and every way you're able.

471
00:42:09,393 --> 00:42:10,728
Let's go.

472
00:42:14,364 --> 00:42:16,266
All right, I'll ask.

473
00:42:16,333 --> 00:42:19,737
Why are we in the middle
of a godforsaken swamp?

474
00:42:19,802 --> 00:42:23,205
It's a favorite hidey hole
of one Alec Holland,

475
00:42:23,273 --> 00:42:27,242
whose corpse was taken to be the
most recent Avatar of the Green.

476
00:42:27,309 --> 00:42:29,612
Bet you won't find that
on your bloody cell phone.

477
00:42:29,679 --> 00:42:31,581
Our data's more factual.

478
00:42:31,648 --> 00:42:34,384
Alec Holland was murdered by terrorists.
His body was never recovered.

479
00:42:34,451 --> 00:42:35,653
End of story.

480
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:37,688
Not quite.

481
00:42:41,324 --> 00:42:45,262
Go away!

482
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:57,574
Swamp Thing!

483
00:42:57,641 --> 00:43:02,613
I know you're seeing this. Get
out here, or the posies get it!

484
00:43:14,724 --> 00:43:17,661
John Constantine.

485
00:43:18,829 --> 00:43:22,532
You dare threaten the green.

486
00:43:28,170 --> 00:43:31,407
Dude, your social skills
are horrendous.

487
00:43:31,474 --> 00:43:36,080
Please, we aren't here to harm any
plants, but our need is urgent.

488
00:43:36,146 --> 00:43:39,682
Don't let your feelings for John
stop you from doing what's right.

489
00:43:43,286 --> 00:43:46,121
You have a garden.

490
00:43:46,188 --> 00:43:52,228
Yes, I find it relaxing,
and I water it every week.

491
00:43:52,295 --> 00:43:56,867
We need to find a man,
a wizard named Felix Faust.

492
00:43:56,932 --> 00:44:01,436
A single human
among your teeming masses.

493
00:44:01,503 --> 00:44:06,876
I only know John Constantine
because he enrages me.

494
00:44:10,914 --> 00:44:13,483
Faust lives in an observatory
which is invisible.

495
00:44:13,550 --> 00:44:17,888
It's a place where dark magic
would infect the earth below it.

496
00:44:17,954 --> 00:44:22,726
I will take you there
so you are no longer here.

497
00:44:36,806 --> 00:44:40,877
The place you seek is there.

498
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:55,858
That place
is heavily warded.

499
00:44:59,762 --> 00:45:03,465
I know we've had our differences,
but we could really use your help.

500
00:45:03,532 --> 00:45:07,438
If we don't get a handle on this rotter,
he'll threaten all of humanity.

501
00:45:08,605 --> 00:45:10,974
What of it?

502
00:45:11,041 --> 00:45:14,445
You were once human,
just like me.

503
00:45:16,179 --> 00:45:17,981
No longer.

504
00:45:18,047 --> 00:45:21,450
Perhaps his actions
are a kind of justice,

505
00:45:21,516 --> 00:45:26,723
for who destroys more of
the green than your kind?

506
00:45:32,228 --> 00:45:35,131
And Swamp Thing
has left the building.

507
00:45:35,199 --> 00:45:37,000
Guess we do it the hard way.

508
00:45:37,067 --> 00:45:41,938
Or not. Gone, gone,
the form of man.

509
00:45:42,005 --> 00:45:45,809
Arise the demon Etrigan!

510
00:46:08,532 --> 00:46:09,767
What...

511
00:46:13,268 --> 00:46:14,302
Who dares?

512
00:46:14,369 --> 00:46:17,773
I, Etrigan,
bring down this house

513
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:20,244
and build a tomb
for Felix Faust!

514
00:46:26,182 --> 00:46:28,784
As if I would stoop
to brawling with a demon.

515
00:46:28,851 --> 00:46:31,054
Fight others
of your filthy kind.

516
00:46:42,231 --> 00:46:46,469
From hell though we may be,
it does not make us family!

517
00:47:07,590 --> 00:47:09,726
Do you like what I've done
with the place?

518
00:47:09,793 --> 00:47:12,894
No woman can speak
in my sanctum sanctorum.

519
00:47:12,961 --> 00:47:17,132
I conjured it just for you and,
of course, men everywhere.

520
00:47:30,646 --> 00:47:33,650
As a fellow showman, this is
no way to treat your guests.

521
00:47:33,717 --> 00:47:35,219
Now, settle down!

522
00:47:42,992 --> 00:47:47,363
Stop hitting yourself. Stop hitting
yourself. Stop hitting yourself.

523
00:47:47,429 --> 00:47:50,399
Not everything can be solved
with your peashooter.

524
00:47:54,371 --> 00:48:00,244
Just because you're dead doesn't
mean you're beyond my retribution.

525
00:48:12,722 --> 00:48:14,824
Is that it?

526
00:48:14,891 --> 00:48:18,628
Well, it's off to the old magicians home
for you, mate. Pudding night is Thursday.

527
00:48:30,172 --> 00:48:33,976
Try that fireball once more, Constantine.
I'd love to see you cook your own goose.

528
00:48:34,043 --> 00:48:35,311
Let me...

529
00:48:55,998 --> 00:48:58,234
I take it back.
That thing is useful.

530
00:49:39,474 --> 00:49:41,677
Zatanna, where
are you, darling?

531
00:49:41,744 --> 00:49:44,448
I know you can't speak,
but give me a wave.

532
00:49:44,514 --> 00:49:47,184
You're the only one here
that's really a threat.

533
00:49:54,490 --> 00:49:58,061
There you are.
This will sting a bit.

534
00:50:20,882 --> 00:50:26,355
Stored magic? Really? It's the TV
dinner of spell casting, dear.

535
00:50:29,291 --> 00:50:31,761
Here's what real magic
looks like.

536
00:51:07,829 --> 00:51:09,231
Z!

537
00:51:46,768 --> 00:51:48,604
Z, are you daft? Stop!

538
00:51:50,907 --> 00:51:52,843
I will kill you, woman!

539
00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:25,909
Z, don't!

540
00:52:29,244 --> 00:52:32,714
Don't kill him. You can't.

541
00:52:32,782 --> 00:52:34,450
Out of my way, John.

542
00:52:34,516 --> 00:52:37,652
If no blood is spilled,
your soul is in the clear.

543
00:52:46,929 --> 00:52:49,900
Get control, Z,
just like I taught you.

544
00:52:49,965 --> 00:52:54,237
Easy-peasy, lemon squeezy.
Deep breaths.

545
00:52:54,903 --> 00:52:56,306
Let it go, love.

546
00:53:18,293 --> 00:53:21,364
Do you see why
I can't do what you do?

547
00:53:21,431 --> 00:53:25,534
You lost control is all.
Happens to the best of us.

548
00:53:25,601 --> 00:53:27,570
You've seen me
in action, right?

549
00:53:28,570 --> 00:53:32,342
Yeah, once or twice.

550
00:53:33,610 --> 00:53:36,546
Why are you here?
I haven't done anything

551
00:53:36,612 --> 00:53:39,348
to warrant this kind
of response.

552
00:53:41,717 --> 00:53:43,418
This yours?

553
00:53:43,485 --> 00:53:46,521
I don't know. Maybe.
I have several hundred rings

554
00:53:46,588 --> 00:53:49,291
of varying design
and properties.

555
00:53:49,358 --> 00:53:50,960
It isn't him.

556
00:53:51,027 --> 00:53:54,230
Felix Faust isn't the one
behind the nightmare crimes.

557
00:53:54,297 --> 00:53:58,367
He summoned our old poker buddies
in their more massive forms.

558
00:53:58,434 --> 00:54:00,269
The hell does it all mean?

559
00:54:00,335 --> 00:54:04,172
It means Felix Faust had access to
the artifact whenever he wanted.

560
00:54:04,239 --> 00:54:06,508
What artifact?

561
00:54:06,576 --> 00:54:08,545
Well, we're back
to square one, then.

562
00:54:08,612 --> 00:54:12,882
Unfortunately, no. We were sent
here by your friend, remember?

563
00:54:12,949 --> 00:54:14,717
But Ritchie's dying.

564
00:54:14,784 --> 00:54:16,286
Is he?

565
00:54:39,742 --> 00:54:43,947
Boy, boy. I think I got closer
to death than I planned.

566
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:48,150
Nuh. Bad girl.

567
00:54:48,217 --> 00:54:53,155
See, now, you were told to do everything
to help me by the master of the House,

568
00:54:53,222 --> 00:54:55,659
and that does not
include punching.

569
00:54:57,693 --> 00:54:59,963
Bring me to the main room.

570
00:55:04,833 --> 00:55:07,303
I'll take it
from here, beautiful.

571
00:55:09,706 --> 00:55:11,907
But I need you
out of my hair for now,

572
00:55:11,974 --> 00:55:15,378
so why don't you just
go for a little walk?

573
00:55:45,141 --> 00:55:48,077
Yeah! That's the stuff.

574
00:55:57,552 --> 00:55:59,121
Why aren't we inside?

575
00:55:59,188 --> 00:56:02,524
Because Ritchie's bloody well
taken control of the House.

576
00:56:02,592 --> 00:56:04,693
This is what you get
for having mates.

577
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:06,563
Boston, can you get inside?

578
00:56:12,501 --> 00:56:15,104
That would be a no.

579
00:56:15,170 --> 00:56:18,974
Ritchie, you're gonna listen to
me whether you like it or not.

580
00:56:21,409 --> 00:56:22,945
Open the door.

581
00:56:24,313 --> 00:56:25,882
Do you hear? Open it!

582
00:56:34,322 --> 00:56:35,891
Too late, Johnny Boy.

583
00:56:51,474 --> 00:56:52,909
Ritchie, please!

584
00:56:52,976 --> 00:56:55,878
Stop while there's still time
to save your soul.

585
00:56:55,945 --> 00:56:59,515
Says the man who skates
away from everything.

586
00:56:59,581 --> 00:57:01,449
Since you got me infected,

587
00:57:01,516 --> 00:57:06,054
I've looked all around the world for
a cure and I've finally found it.

588
00:57:06,121 --> 00:57:09,893
A small piece of the Dreamstone.
It's sentient.

589
00:57:09,958 --> 00:57:15,029
It told me how to get the Demons Three
to bring the rest of it to Earth.

590
00:57:15,097 --> 00:57:18,333
It would've been so easy
to take it from them.

591
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:23,439
Of course, rock star Johnny
screwed everything sideways.

592
00:57:23,505 --> 00:57:28,376
So we had to frame Faust
and get you to bring me here.

593
00:57:28,443 --> 00:57:32,413
Now I'm immortal
and supercharged!

594
00:57:32,481 --> 00:57:36,319
You've been played for a sap.
The Stone isn't sentient.

595
00:57:36,385 --> 00:57:39,989
What's left of Destiny's soul was
whispering sweet nothings in your ear,

596
00:57:40,056 --> 00:57:44,393
getting you to commit atrocities
to gain power and make his move.

597
00:57:44,460 --> 00:57:46,862
You're just pissed
'cause I won.

598
00:57:46,929 --> 00:57:48,565
I wish that were the case.

599
00:57:50,132 --> 00:57:51,900
This can't be right.

600
00:57:54,402 --> 00:57:55,403
No!

601
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:02,578
Wait! Wait! We...
We had a deal!

602
00:58:04,347 --> 00:58:06,115
We had a deal!

603
00:58:16,992 --> 00:58:19,761
Five hundred years,
I've waited.

604
00:58:21,697 --> 00:58:24,133
Five hundred years,
I've planned.

605
00:58:26,034 --> 00:58:29,239
Really? I guess 500
must be the new 300.

606
00:58:29,304 --> 00:58:32,207
What say we share your
beauty secrets over a pint?

607
00:58:32,275 --> 00:58:35,177
A god does not prattle
with mortals.

608
00:58:55,097 --> 00:58:56,465
She gonna be okay?

609
00:58:56,532 --> 00:58:59,001
I... I don't know.

610
00:58:59,068 --> 00:59:01,604
The amount of magic
she's used,

611
00:59:01,670 --> 00:59:03,739
sometimes you don't recover.

612
00:59:09,077 --> 00:59:11,280
I should have never
led her back.

613
00:59:11,346 --> 00:59:13,014
Selfish bastard, I am.

614
00:59:13,081 --> 00:59:15,150
You've done
what you can for now,

615
00:59:15,217 --> 00:59:18,988
but we have to stop Destiny,
or everyone's at risk.

616
00:59:19,054 --> 00:59:20,623
He's right.

617
00:59:20,690 --> 00:59:23,892
He'll have this city by midnight,
the Eastern Seaboard by dawn.

618
00:59:23,958 --> 00:59:27,328
Then, what's to stop him?
He'll be a god.

619
00:59:27,396 --> 00:59:29,899
We don't need another one
of those mucking about.

620
00:59:30,699 --> 00:59:32,434
All right.

621
01:00:12,141 --> 01:00:13,675
Get them!

622
01:00:13,742 --> 01:00:17,144
They're everywhere!
Everywhere!

623
01:00:17,211 --> 01:00:18,614
Yes.

624
01:00:19,014 --> 01:00:21,017
Yes.

625
01:00:21,083 --> 01:00:22,918
My will be done.

626
01:00:28,257 --> 01:00:31,626
Fool! How can you hope
to defeat a god?

627
01:00:31,693 --> 01:00:35,664
Not only can I sense you,
you cannot defeat my shield.

628
01:00:35,731 --> 01:00:38,635
Since when does God
need a force shield?

629
01:00:50,346 --> 01:00:52,280
The Justice League
are on their way.

630
01:00:52,347 --> 01:00:54,315
Suppose that couldn't
be helped,

631
01:00:54,382 --> 01:00:56,885
but make sure they stay
well away from Destiny,

632
01:00:56,952 --> 01:00:58,854
to not be struck mad,

633
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:02,457
unless you want a bunch of crazed
super blokes ripping apart the city.

634
01:01:05,226 --> 01:01:07,996
A little late for that,
my friend.

635
01:01:23,978 --> 01:01:26,381
<i>John, listen to me.
You've been affected by magic.</i>

636
01:01:29,652 --> 01:01:31,487
<i>Get away to space now.</i>

637
01:01:44,833 --> 01:01:46,769
Sorry to have
to ask this, Jason.

638
01:01:46,835 --> 01:01:48,704
At least you're asking.

639
01:01:49,672 --> 01:01:52,507
Gone, gone, the form of man.

640
01:01:52,574 --> 01:01:56,311
Rise the demon Etrigan!

641
01:01:56,378 --> 01:01:59,981
So Constantine calls
once more.

642
01:02:00,048 --> 01:02:02,518
Just like a greedy, wanton...

643
01:02:02,585 --> 01:02:04,987
Save the bloody rhymes,
and top that git!

644
01:02:05,054 --> 01:02:06,389
Killjoy.

645
01:02:11,393 --> 01:02:15,063
I've had many years to
think about you, Etrigan.

646
01:02:25,940 --> 01:02:28,076
Call this poetic justice.

647
01:02:43,224 --> 01:02:44,493
Holy crap.

648
01:02:50,298 --> 01:02:52,969
Looks like you've finally
beat the curse, my boy.

649
01:02:53,034 --> 01:02:55,237
Wish it were under
happier circumstances.

650
01:02:57,405 --> 01:02:58,407
What are you doing?

651
01:02:58,474 --> 01:02:59,807
Calling for help.

652
01:02:59,875 --> 01:03:03,010
I just hope he doesn't realize
it's me doing the calling.

653
01:03:18,927 --> 01:03:21,529
Who dares strike at me?

654
01:03:21,597 --> 01:03:28,371
The Defender of the Green,
Swamp Thing.

655
01:03:48,623 --> 01:03:49,858
Perfect.

656
01:04:01,202 --> 01:04:03,005
Glad to see you
back on your feet, Zatanna.

657
01:04:11,213 --> 01:04:13,582
Whatever you're gonna do,
do it fast.

658
01:05:02,063 --> 01:05:03,965
The so-called
Guardian of the Green

659
01:05:04,032 --> 01:05:06,402
who secretly hopes
to be human again.

660
01:05:07,469 --> 01:05:09,904
Let me dispel you
of that notion.

661
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:28,290
Back to the dirt,

662
01:05:29,657 --> 01:05:31,527
where you belong.

663
01:05:43,237 --> 01:05:46,474
He's getting more powerful by the
second. What the hell are we gonna do?

664
01:05:46,541 --> 01:05:49,010
I say we go and talk
to a man about a horse.

665
01:05:49,077 --> 01:05:51,280
Did you hit your head or
something? You're babbling.

666
01:05:51,347 --> 01:05:54,050
A Trojan horse, Boston.
Come on!

667
01:05:56,617 --> 01:05:58,954
Over here, you wanker!

668
01:06:01,889 --> 01:06:05,025
You are puny
and disrespectful.

669
01:06:05,092 --> 01:06:07,495
Let me see your madness.

670
01:06:14,503 --> 01:06:17,439
Well, that's the trouble with someone
like me. Been there, done that.

671
01:06:17,505 --> 01:06:20,942
I shall make you beg
for death.

672
01:06:21,009 --> 01:06:23,110
Can I beg you to stop talking?

673
01:06:23,177 --> 01:06:26,648
I mean, all wizards are touched, but
you, you're a full-blown nutter.

674
01:06:26,715 --> 01:06:30,418
I will tear your soul apart.

675
01:06:30,485 --> 01:06:32,954
And what happened to not
prattling with mortals?

676
01:06:33,021 --> 01:06:35,658
You chatter like my
grandma at a book club.

677
01:06:37,126 --> 01:06:39,061
Now, Boston!

678
01:06:39,126 --> 01:06:41,096
Trick or treat, freak!

679
01:07:00,614 --> 01:07:03,485
Is that a sword in your chest,
or are you just glad to see me?

680
01:07:04,853 --> 01:07:07,355
Merlin sends his regards.

681
01:07:07,422 --> 01:07:10,826
And by the way, you lose.

682
01:07:31,780 --> 01:07:33,282
I don't think so.

683
01:07:52,568 --> 01:07:54,136
Johnny, I was...

684
01:07:54,202 --> 01:07:57,305
I was under a compulsion.
You've got to save me.

685
01:07:57,371 --> 01:08:00,408
You owe me. You owe me!

686
01:08:00,476 --> 01:08:04,814
Sorry, mate. Can't take the chance that
Destiny is still pulling your strings.

687
01:08:06,914 --> 01:08:09,717
John, please! Help me!

688
01:08:16,725 --> 01:08:19,894
Help me, you bastard!

689
01:08:19,961 --> 01:08:22,865
Help me!

690
01:08:23,864 --> 01:08:26,402
That was unpleasant.

691
01:08:26,467 --> 01:08:28,503
What the hell did I miss?

692
01:08:28,570 --> 01:08:31,706
Z, you're okay. I thought...

693
01:08:31,773 --> 01:08:34,743
My head feels like
the morning after Brixton.

694
01:08:36,110 --> 01:08:37,613
Surely not that bad.

695
01:08:39,213 --> 01:08:43,118
So Merlin's spell hath ended.

696
01:08:43,185 --> 01:08:44,953
It would seem so.

697
01:08:45,020 --> 01:08:48,657
Though it's a "good news,
bad news" sort of thing.

698
01:09:00,168 --> 01:09:03,005
-What's going on?
-Yeah. He wasn't wounded.

699
01:09:03,070 --> 01:09:07,342
Unless I miss my guess, that happened
on the day he was bound to Etrigan.

700
01:09:09,310 --> 01:09:11,779
And now that I'm not...

701
01:09:11,846 --> 01:09:14,148
I'm truly sorry, Jason.

702
01:09:14,216 --> 01:09:17,820
Don't be. It's a welcome end.

703
01:09:29,965 --> 01:09:34,269
For 500 years,
he and I have been bound.

704
01:09:34,336 --> 01:09:38,606
A demon from hell,
a knight of renown.

705
01:09:38,672 --> 01:09:42,543
Though we were cursed
to be slaves to each other,

706
01:09:42,610 --> 01:09:46,481
I know of no man
I'd want more for a brother.

707
01:09:47,082 --> 01:09:48,584
Farewell, mortal.

708
01:10:04,131 --> 01:10:06,934
You couldn't
have picked a better place.

709
01:10:07,002 --> 01:10:09,571
The village where he was
born was over there.

710
01:10:09,637 --> 01:10:11,873
Too bad it took this
to get him home.

711
01:10:13,475 --> 01:10:15,945
Batman asked me
to be in the Justice League.

712
01:10:17,112 --> 01:10:18,480
And you're considering it?

713
01:10:18,546 --> 01:10:21,415
I visited their headquarters
a few days ago.

714
01:10:21,483 --> 01:10:23,784
It's interesting,
and like you said,

715
01:10:23,851 --> 01:10:26,421
maybe it's time
to make a difference.

716
01:10:26,488 --> 01:10:29,289
Listening to me now?

717
01:10:29,356 --> 01:10:30,992
They want you, too.

718
01:10:33,162 --> 01:10:35,831
Good one, Z.
Too right, they do.

719
01:10:38,766 --> 01:10:42,570
You have got to be
bloody kidding. No way.

720
01:10:42,636 --> 01:10:44,206
Batty would go mental.

721
01:10:44,273 --> 01:10:48,644
He was the one who asked, and I
told him that's what you'd say.

722
01:10:51,345 --> 01:10:52,747
Be safe, John.

723
01:11:06,461 --> 01:11:08,597
Now, hold on. Hold on.

724
01:11:08,663 --> 01:11:10,631
Maybe I've been a bit rash.

725
01:11:10,698 --> 01:11:12,768
Could you tell me more
over a drink?

726
01:11:14,136 --> 01:11:17,273
We could rechristen the House,
as it were.

727
01:11:17,671 --> 01:11:18,806
A drink?

728
01:11:18,873 --> 01:11:20,842
Yeah, a drink.

729
01:11:24,212 --> 01:11:28,583
Don't think this is gonna turn into
some sort of Manchester weekend.

730
01:11:28,649 --> 01:11:31,252
Get that out of your head.

731
01:11:31,319 --> 01:11:33,621
We could have
a Trewhiddle Tuesday.

732
01:11:33,689 --> 01:11:36,291
No, definitely not.

733
01:11:36,358 --> 01:11:38,460
Well, let's mark that
as a maybe.

734
01:11:57,145 --> 01:12:00,382
Now, that's what I call
making yourself useful, love.
