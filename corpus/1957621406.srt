177
00:11:43,136 --> 00:11:44,972
Who's that girl?

178
00:11:48,876 --> 00:11:49,943
Come on, let's go.

179
00:11:49,977 --> 00:11:52,279
No. No, wait a second.
I want you to introduce us.

180
00:11:52,913 --> 00:11:53,881
But I don't
know her.

181
00:11:53,914 --> 00:11:55,916
Yeah, but you're good
at that kind of thing.

182
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:57,818
Hey, look, why don't
you go over there

183
00:11:57,851 --> 00:12:00,353
and you tell her about me,
and then you call me over,
okay?

184
00:12:00,888 --> 00:12:03,390
Don't tell her...
Just tell her
something good, huh?

185
00:12:03,824 --> 00:12:04,858
Let's get to work.

186
00:12:04,892 --> 00:12:07,294
Now, come on, Dave,
just this once.

187
00:12:08,195 --> 00:12:09,262
Please?

188
00:12:09,496 --> 00:12:11,298
You know, it's people
like you...

189
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,102
Hi.
Hi.

190
00:12:15,302 --> 00:12:16,403
I'm David.

191
00:12:16,837 --> 00:12:17,971
Penelope Powell.

192
00:12:18,005 --> 00:12:20,073
That's a nice dress
you're not wearing,
Penelope.

193
00:12:20,107 --> 00:12:22,843
Craves accessories.
They come with
the outfit?

194
00:12:22,876 --> 00:12:24,344
Just kidding.

195
00:12:29,349 --> 00:12:31,051
Me? Oh, you need me?

196
00:12:36,123 --> 00:12:38,225
Zane, this is
Penelope Powell.

197
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:43,096
Penelope, this is Zane Smith,
the producer-creator
of our show.

198
00:12:44,364 --> 00:12:46,934
It's nice to meet you.

199
00:12:47,367 --> 00:12:48,969
It's my pleasure.

200
00:12:56,476 --> 00:12:58,879
Well, David,
we'd better get back
to work, huh?

201
00:12:58,912 --> 00:13:00,881
Sure, I guess.

202
00:13:01,081 --> 00:13:02,482
All right.
Nice talking to you,
Penelope.

203
00:13:02,515 --> 00:13:05,418
Yeah. Yeah, it was
really nice to meet you.

204
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:06,887
You, too.

205
00:13:07,888 --> 00:13:09,356
Bye.
Bye.

206
00:13:28,075 --> 00:13:28,942
(LAUGHS)

207
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:36,049
We've been sitting here
for two and a half hours.

208
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:37,885
This is crazy.

209
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,989
I just can't believe it,
you know?
I just can't believe it.

210
00:13:42,022 --> 00:13:43,190
I said two things to her.

211
00:13:43,223 --> 00:13:44,557
"Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet..."

212
00:13:44,591 --> 00:13:46,126
I mean,
she probably thinks
I'm a total idiot.

213
00:13:47,594 --> 00:13:49,129
What are you scared of?

214
00:13:49,396 --> 00:13:51,131
You're the producer.

215
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:52,900
The producer!

216
00:13:53,066 --> 00:13:54,902
She's just some
day player.

217
00:13:54,935 --> 00:13:56,303
She wants to know you.

218
00:14:00,273 --> 00:14:02,475
Wait a minute.
You're right.

219
00:14:02,943 --> 00:14:04,344
I mean, I'm the one
who's in control here,
right?

220
00:14:04,377 --> 00:14:07,147
I mean, she should be
afraid of me, right?

221
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,082
Right. Absolutely.

222
00:14:09,316 --> 00:14:12,319
I hate to use
the word "genius,"
why don't you?

223
00:14:15,022 --> 00:14:16,089
All right.

224
00:14:16,123 --> 00:14:18,926
Now if that's
taken care of,
let's get to work.

225
00:14:18,926 --> 00:14:20,027
Okay.

226
00:14:21,128 --> 00:14:23,096
Let's start at the end.
We don't want a corrupt cop.

227
00:14:23,931 --> 00:14:25,498
So let's make Monihan a P.I.

228
00:14:25,966 --> 00:14:28,936
This way it's good P.I.
versus bad P.I.

229
00:14:30,137 --> 00:14:31,504
That sucks.

230
00:14:31,972 --> 00:14:34,574
Well, of course it sucks,
but who cares?

231
00:14:35,508 --> 00:14:37,010
It's just TV.

232
00:14:38,645 --> 00:14:41,181
I can't believe
what's happened
to this show.

233
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:43,116
I can't believe
what's happened to you.

234
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:44,985
You used to be
the wonder boy.

235
00:14:45,018 --> 00:14:47,587
You could work out
a whole story
in 30 minutes,

236
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,056
write an entire episode
in two days.

237
00:14:49,089 --> 00:14:52,960
I've seen you wing it
on the phone with
a hostile network executive,

238
00:14:52,993 --> 00:14:54,627
and have him eating
out of your hand.

239
00:14:54,661 --> 00:14:55,963
You were beautiful.

240
00:14:55,996 --> 00:14:57,965
What do you think
she'd say if I said,

241
00:14:57,965 --> 00:14:59,666
no commitments
from her or me?

242
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:01,601
You know, no promises.

243
00:15:02,269 --> 00:15:03,971
Maybe the three of us
could go out
on a date together?

244
00:15:03,971 --> 00:15:06,073
What do you think?
Whatever you say.

245
00:15:06,106 --> 00:15:08,008
Let's just get this done.

246
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:10,043
It's getting late
and we don't get
paid by the hour.

247
00:15:10,077 --> 00:15:11,979
The only thing is,
you know, if we all
three go out together,

248
00:15:12,012 --> 00:15:14,647
it's going to seem more
like we're just friends
than a big date.

249
00:15:15,215 --> 00:15:17,250

It was him!

Hey, don't worry.

256
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:41,008

Good. Good.
No, never mind
that, darling.

Look, I want
everyone in wardrobe
for Scene 26, okay?

260
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,384
That is a print.

261
00:15:53,586 --> 00:15:55,722
Where'd you find
those girls?

262
00:15:55,755 --> 00:15:59,026
How you doing, Gino?
Zane. Zane,
you got a second?

263
00:15:59,726 --> 00:16:01,328
No, I don't.

264
00:16:04,131 --> 00:16:05,365
Come on.

ZANE: Hi.

267
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:16,176
You're Penelope, right?
Hi. Yeah, and you're Zane.

268
00:16:16,743 --> 00:16:19,446
That's a memorable name.
Yeah, well, so is Penelope.

269
00:16:24,051 --> 00:16:25,652
Oh, sorry about that.

270
00:16:26,553 --> 00:16:28,055
It's a dangerous
addiction.

271
00:16:28,088 --> 00:16:29,722
Yeah, well,
I'm trying to quit,

272
00:16:29,756 --> 00:16:32,359
but it's not
the easiest thing in
the world, you know?

273
00:16:34,094 --> 00:16:38,731
I just came by to say
that I was, you know, sorry
about rushing out earlier,

274
00:16:38,765 --> 00:16:42,069
but I had some...
Some writing to do.

275
00:16:42,635 --> 00:16:44,504
I thought you were
the producer.

276
00:16:45,138 --> 00:16:50,243
Oh, yeah, I am
the writer, producer,
creator extraordinaire.

277
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:54,247
You're pretty young.
You must be real talented.

278
00:16:54,547 --> 00:16:56,083
Or lucky.

279
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,785
You know what they say
about luck.

280
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,221
Yeah.

Yeah.

283
00:17:08,628 --> 00:17:09,729
Yeah.

284
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:13,100
So, you're girl
number three, right?
Right.

285
00:17:13,133 --> 00:17:17,270
Yeah, you are very good.
You got this quality,
I don't know.

286
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:19,739
Well, thanks.

287
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:24,211
Did you write
this script?

288
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:29,649
Yeah, me and
my writing partner,
David, did that.

289
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:33,186
Must be tough coming up
with new ideas every week.

290
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:34,821
Not really.

291
00:17:36,123 --> 00:17:37,590
Every show is really
just a variation on
the same theme.

292
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:40,127
The networks say
they want something new,

293
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,263
but you give them something
original and they just
throw it in the trash.

294
00:17:44,764 --> 00:17:46,266
Why?

295
00:17:46,299 --> 00:17:49,636
I don't know. They're trying
to break our spirits,
I guess, make us obey.

296
00:17:52,239 --> 00:17:54,141
That's awfully cynical.

297
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:57,677
It's also
unfortunately true.

298
00:17:58,178 --> 00:18:00,147
You'll find out.

299
00:18:00,147 --> 00:18:01,514
That's pretty sad.

300
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:05,418
Not really, you know.
It's just the way it is.

301
00:18:05,785 --> 00:18:07,154

a little bit. Loosen up.
All right. Good.

easy shot, ladies.
All right?

310
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:36,583
Now, remember,
Reno has saved
you all from

311
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:38,418
the lingerie
serial killer, right?

312
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:41,754

the door, I want lots of
excitement.

313

I mean, go for him.
Rip at his clothes.

314

After all, you're grateful
to this old big guy here
for saving your life, right?

315
00:18:48,728 --> 00:18:50,797
And don't worry.
You're not going
to hurt him.

have got fingernails.

he needs a hug,

* My horse hide

* I feel its barb
each time I hope for
the everlasting love

* Of a heaven not of metal
Of new earth, with new dirt

DIRECTOR: Reno,

534
00:32:01,387 --> 00:32:02,688
But I've got to go.
It was good.

535
00:32:02,721 --> 00:32:04,323
Thank you.
Keep it up.

536
00:32:06,092 --> 00:32:08,260
Hi, Zane.
Hi.

537
00:32:08,627 --> 00:32:10,997
How you doing?
Great.

538
00:32:11,998 --> 00:32:14,000
Who was that guy
you were talking to?

539
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,734
It's Todd,
he's in my acting class.

540
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:17,269
He is so sweet.

(SIGHS)

542
00:32:20,039 --> 00:32:21,507
Is something wrong?

543
00:32:22,074 --> 00:32:22,708
No.

544
00:32:24,043 --> 00:32:27,179
You seem like
you're mad at me.
No, I just had a shitty day.

545
00:32:28,747 --> 00:32:31,083
You want to talk about it?
I'm a really good listener.

546
00:32:31,117 --> 00:32:32,718
No, that's okay.

547
00:32:35,654 --> 00:32:38,024
I think maybe
you just need a hug.

548
00:32:46,365 --> 00:32:47,666
Feel better?

549
00:32:48,567 --> 00:32:50,036
Yeah,

550
00:32:51,703 --> 00:32:53,205
that felt good.

551
00:32:59,778 --> 00:33:01,080
Oh, boy.

552
00:33:03,382 --> 00:33:05,684
Hey, I thought
you'd quit that.

553
00:33:06,152 --> 00:33:07,586
Yeah, I did.

554
00:33:08,654 --> 00:33:11,457
See how easy it is?
Yeah. What the heck?

555
00:33:13,759 --> 00:33:17,063
I'm just sort of stopping
in between. I'm on my way
to pitch a story. I...

556
00:33:17,096 --> 00:33:19,331
Really? What's it about?
Well, it's...

557
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:23,069
It's kind of hard
to explain in
a couple of minutes,

558
00:33:23,102 --> 00:33:26,172
but it's about this,
you know this...

559
00:33:27,173 --> 00:33:28,607
I have such a hard time
doing one-liners,

560
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:32,211
but it's about this woman
and this kid, they live
together, you know.

561
00:33:32,244 --> 00:33:34,080
It's a really
special story.

562
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,248
It's not like
the normal crap
you see on TV.

563
00:33:36,282 --> 00:33:39,085
It's something
I care about,
it's original.

564
00:33:39,318 --> 00:33:41,620
Great, sounds interesting.
Yeah.

565
00:33:45,091 --> 00:33:46,592
Would you have
dinner with me?

566
00:33:48,494 --> 00:33:49,595
Ever?

567
00:33:50,696 --> 00:33:51,797
Sure.

568
00:33:53,099 --> 00:33:55,134
Yeah?
Yeah.

569
00:33:57,103 --> 00:33:58,670
Beam us up, Ralph.

570
00:34:06,478 --> 00:34:09,815
She closes the door,
the credits roll,

571
00:34:10,649 --> 00:34:13,819
the screen goes to black,
the end.

572
00:34:27,733 --> 00:34:29,268
I like it.

573
00:34:30,636 --> 00:34:32,271
I like it a lot.

574
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:36,208
I like it a lot.

575
00:34:36,475 --> 00:34:37,709
It's got a lot.

576
00:34:38,244 --> 00:34:39,645
You know what
it doesn't have?

577
00:34:39,678 --> 00:34:41,747
It doesn't have a hook.
No hook?

578
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:43,382
It needs a hook.
It needs a hook.

579
00:34:43,415 --> 00:34:45,551
Let me see,
this lady's got
a kid, right?

580
00:34:46,318 --> 00:34:47,386
Right.

581
00:34:47,419 --> 00:34:49,155
What's wrong
with the kid?

582
00:34:50,556 --> 00:34:52,491
There's nothing wrong
with him, except for
the fact that he's lonely.

583
00:34:54,226 --> 00:34:56,428
No, there's got to be
something wrong with him.
Let me see...

584
00:34:56,462 --> 00:34:58,597
The kid's got a disease,
that's it. Wait a minute...

585
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:00,766
Better yet,
he's deformed.

586
00:35:04,436 --> 00:35:05,837
There's your hook.

587
00:35:06,905 --> 00:35:08,073
That's a great hook.

588
00:35:08,174 --> 00:35:10,776
Yeah, great hook.
Okay, give me
the ball back, huh?

589
00:35:12,211 --> 00:35:13,912
Zane, give the man
back his ball.

590
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:15,714
Yeah, I'm on a roll now.

591
00:35:15,747 --> 00:35:17,683
So this lady has
a deformed kid, right?

592
00:35:17,716 --> 00:35:20,752
So her husband leaves her
and the whole neighborhood
turns against her,

593
00:35:20,786 --> 00:35:23,855
and in the end,
she marries
her psychiatrist,

594
00:35:23,889 --> 00:35:27,326
and they start adopting
other deformed kids, huh?

595
00:35:28,327 --> 00:35:30,196
You got me,
you're on a roll.

596
00:35:30,396 --> 00:35:31,863
Yeah, I got it,
now let me see.

597
00:35:31,897 --> 00:35:34,466
So they buy this place
called Camp Love.

598
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,436
That's where all
the deformed kids get together
and they live there, right?

599
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:40,672
And at the end,
the neighbors finally
realize that

600
00:35:40,706 --> 00:35:43,242
it's more important
to love these kids
because they're special

601
00:35:43,275 --> 00:35:45,877
rather than hate them
because they are unusual.

602
00:35:45,911 --> 00:35:47,913
That's a perfect ad line
for TV Guide.

603
00:35:47,946 --> 00:35:51,283
Who do you see
as the woman here?
Well, you got me.

604
00:35:52,351 --> 00:35:54,620
Bonnie Franklin.
No, Tyne Daly.

605
00:35:54,653 --> 00:35:55,787
Loni Anderson.

606
00:35:55,821 --> 00:35:57,923
Loretta Swit.
Meredith Baxter-Birney.

Valerie Bertinelli Van Halen.

609
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:05,664
Oh, say no more,
I love it.

610
00:36:06,332 --> 00:36:10,902
Yeah, let me see,
we'll call it
Thalidomide Mom.

611
00:36:12,771 --> 00:36:14,906
Wow, that's
pure Emmy bait.

612
00:36:17,276 --> 00:36:19,878
Yeah, there's only one
problem there. I already
have Amphetamine Dad

613
00:36:19,911 --> 00:36:24,416
and PCP Teen Mom
in development.
It's very...

614
00:36:25,817 --> 00:36:27,886
I don't know,
let me give it
some thought.

615
00:36:27,919 --> 00:36:30,256
Hey, but it was
a great story,
guys. Really.

616
00:36:30,922 --> 00:36:32,791
Yeah, but it's
not our story.

617
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:35,927
Hey, it was damn good.

618
00:36:49,941 --> 00:36:51,743
That was beautiful, baby.

619
00:36:51,777 --> 00:36:54,546
Oh, yeah? Let me ask you,
what happened to you
in there?

620
00:36:54,846 --> 00:36:57,583
That wasn't our story.
That was a typical
Hollywood nightmare.

621
00:36:57,616 --> 00:37:00,986
So big deal.
He liked it, he loved it,
he wanted it.

622
00:37:01,019 --> 00:37:02,454
It was standard
TV schlock.

623
00:37:02,488 --> 00:37:03,822
I don't want to write
that kind of stuff.

624
00:37:03,855 --> 00:37:05,023
Since when?

625
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:06,858
That's the business
we're in, pal.

626
00:37:06,892 --> 00:37:08,860
Doesn't matter whether
it's good or bad,

627
00:37:08,894 --> 00:37:10,829
just as long as
we get the money.

628
00:37:10,862 --> 00:37:12,864
So that's what
it's all about,
huh, Dave?

629
00:37:12,898 --> 00:37:15,301
I thought the best things
in life were free.

630
00:37:15,301 --> 00:37:18,670
He says, leaning
against his brand
new Mercedes-Benz.

(MOCKINGLY)
Zane! Come back, Zane!

632
00:37:37,323 --> 00:37:38,457
ZANE: So,

633
00:37:39,591 --> 00:37:41,593
my dad's been gone
about seven years now.

634
00:37:41,627 --> 00:37:45,331
I'm pretty much over
the bad grief part of it,
but I still really miss him.

635
00:37:45,364 --> 00:37:48,700
We were like, partners
in crime, you know.

636
00:37:50,469 --> 00:37:52,938
What about your mom,
is she still alive?

637
00:37:52,971 --> 00:37:56,375
She died when I was five.
My dad pretty much raised me.

638
00:37:56,908 --> 00:37:58,810
So you're
all alone now?

639
00:37:58,844 --> 00:38:00,546
Sure, rub it in.

640
00:38:01,647 --> 00:38:02,914
I'm sorry.

641
00:38:02,948 --> 00:38:04,683
I was only joking.

642
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:07,719
Thank you, Tony.

643
00:38:09,955 --> 00:38:13,359
So she comes
to Hollywood
from Cheektowaga.

644
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:16,595
And what,
to seek money,
fame, fortune?

645
00:38:16,928 --> 00:38:18,864
Sounds pretty good.

646
00:38:20,366 --> 00:38:22,768
No, I guess,
I just really
want to be happy.

647
00:38:22,801 --> 00:38:25,571
What does that mean?

648
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:29,841
Being in love.

649
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,548
So what about you?

650
00:38:36,948 --> 00:38:39,451
So does that mean
that you don't have
a boyfriend?

651
00:38:40,952 --> 00:38:42,854
Nope. Not yet.

* Everybody knew
it just couldn't last

653
00:38:48,994 --> 00:38:51,863
What about you?
What do you want?

654
00:38:51,897 --> 00:38:54,600
* Oh, play it again

655
00:38:54,633 --> 00:38:55,834
* Play it again

656
00:38:55,867 --> 00:38:57,903
* Yeah, play it again

657
00:38:57,936 --> 00:38:59,738
Um...

658
00:38:59,771 --> 00:39:01,640
* It's not that
easy to do

659
00:39:05,043 --> 00:39:07,813
* It's just like a song

660
00:39:09,047 --> 00:39:10,749
I don't know.

661
00:39:12,551 --> 00:39:18,557
* The melody is
likely to elude *

662
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:58,664
I feel really funny
telling you this.

663
00:39:58,864 --> 00:40:01,800
I never actually saw
Rock-n-Roll P.I.

664
00:40:03,101 --> 00:40:05,103
I'm sorry.

665
00:40:05,671 --> 00:40:06,972
You are bad.

666
00:40:07,005 --> 00:40:08,073
(CHUCKLING)

667
00:40:08,106 --> 00:40:09,808
What's it about?

668
00:40:10,008 --> 00:40:11,109
Oh, well...

669
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,746
Originally, it was
an idea that my father
and I came up with

670
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:16,948
a long time ago
about him and me.

671
00:40:16,982 --> 00:40:19,818
It was a pretty cool idea
at one time. It was about
a writer and his son.

672
00:40:19,851 --> 00:40:23,188
And then the networks
bought it and changed it.

673
00:40:24,055 --> 00:40:25,757
I didn't know
your father
was a writer.

674
00:40:25,791 --> 00:40:27,593
Yeah, he was
a better writer
than I am.

675
00:40:27,626 --> 00:40:28,894
But unfortunately,

676
00:40:29,861 --> 00:40:32,197
talent doesn't
count for too much
in this town.

677
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:35,901
Well, what's it about now?
Oh...

678
00:40:37,803 --> 00:40:39,004
Well...

679
00:40:39,705 --> 00:40:42,073
A retired motorcycle cop

680
00:40:42,107 --> 00:40:44,910
finds an orphaned
teenage kid, beat up,

681
00:40:44,943 --> 00:40:46,945
in a dumpster behind
a disco downtown.

682
00:40:46,978 --> 00:40:48,446
He adopts him.

683
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:52,484
They work together as
private eyes by day and
rock 'n' rollers by night.

684
00:40:53,685 --> 00:40:56,922
You know,
the ex-cop father,
the rock 'n' roll son.

685
00:40:57,723 --> 00:41:00,826
Two generations
working together. It's
the perfect TV concept.

686
00:41:02,193 --> 00:41:03,795
It sucks.

687
00:41:03,829 --> 00:41:05,697
They sold us out.
They?

688
00:41:05,931 --> 00:41:07,132
Yeah, the networks.

689
00:41:07,165 --> 00:41:09,200
I mean, they could have
done something with it,
anything.

690
00:41:09,234 --> 00:41:11,970
They could have
made it off-beat,
interesting...

691
00:41:13,805 --> 00:41:16,908
I don't know.
It's just typical TV.
They sold us out.

692
00:41:22,614 --> 00:41:24,916
Looks like you got
a pretty good price.

693
00:41:29,821 --> 00:41:31,623
Mind if I play
some music?

694
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:34,159
No, anything you'd like.

No, I think you

And I don't
see you that way.

Yeah. Yeah,
I really think so.

734
00:45:20,485 --> 00:45:22,888
Why do you seem to be
so troubled then?

735
00:45:25,190 --> 00:45:27,158
Maybe wanting to be great
in someone else's eyes

736
00:45:27,192 --> 00:45:28,927
makes us examine ourselves
more closely.

737
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:31,296
Well, that's what
we're here for.

738
00:45:34,432 --> 00:45:36,868
I just really think
I sold out.

739
00:45:37,936 --> 00:45:40,471
Where does all this
guilt come from?

740
00:45:41,139 --> 00:45:43,174
I just wanted
to be a great writer,
like my dad, you know.

741
00:45:43,208 --> 00:45:45,076
He was an artist.

742
00:45:45,276 --> 00:45:48,246
Well, as I understand it,
he never really
got anywhere.

743
00:45:48,279 --> 00:45:50,916
Well, that depends on
how you look at it.

744
00:45:51,883 --> 00:45:54,452
I couldn't feel good
about myself if I knew
I willingly sold out.

745
00:45:54,485 --> 00:45:56,855
Maybe you
were seduced.

746
00:45:58,323 --> 00:45:59,490
Was I?

747
00:45:59,991 --> 00:46:01,092
Let me ask you,

748
00:46:02,093 --> 00:46:05,997
would you rather have
the money or the art?

749
00:46:08,533 --> 00:46:09,901
Both.

750
00:46:09,935 --> 00:46:11,903
Well, maybe you
can't have both.

751
00:46:13,304 --> 00:46:14,505
Well...

752
00:46:18,109 --> 00:46:22,047
Well, if I said the money,
I couldn't respect myself.

753
00:46:23,081 --> 00:46:27,285
And if I said the art,
I couldn't afford you.

754
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:33,091
Maybe we better have
a little hypnotherapy.

755
00:46:35,593 --> 00:46:36,761

when all of a sudden...

758
00:46:40,966 --> 00:46:42,868
She said she was
going to call.

759
00:46:44,135 --> 00:46:46,304
Maybe I should check
my answering machine.

760
00:46:46,337 --> 00:46:48,273
Sounds like
a blow-off line to me.

761
00:46:48,306 --> 00:46:51,076

I'll call you."

772
00:47:25,010 --> 00:47:26,044
And maybe
I should call her.

773
00:47:26,077 --> 00:47:26,912
What do you think?
Is it too soon
to call her?

774
00:47:26,912 --> 00:47:27,778
No. No, it's not
too soon to call.

775
00:47:27,812 --> 00:47:30,015
Go ahead and call her.
Go ahead and call.

Then we can
get back to work.

777

call me. I mean, I don't want
to come off too eager.

778
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:36,922
Then don't call her.

she doesn't call?

(STAMMERING) I know what
you're trying to do here.

What are you
talking about?

799
00:48:46,992 --> 00:48:49,360
He's talking about how
the government uses taxes

800
00:48:49,394 --> 00:48:52,030
to control the flow of energy
and subvert the life force.

801
00:48:54,099 --> 00:48:56,667
The IRS has disallowed
investment tax credits

partnerships.

803
00:48:58,603 --> 00:49:00,438

a little unfair.

talking about?

It depends.

in deductions for
entertainment expenses.

808

Don't you have a diary,
something to substantiate

I think, you know,
I'll be much more
organized in the future.

Revenue Service Code

to you about Reno.

putting me down

to him about it.

to blow it, though.

You know,
you might need
some real advice.

997
00:59:43,648 --> 00:59:44,849
Maybe you should
talk to Reno.

998
00:59:44,882 --> 00:59:46,984
No, thanks, David.
Let me do this.

Seriously. Both of you.

I'm doing this for you.

Reno.

1002
00:59:55,259 --> 00:59:56,661
Think about it.

Yo, what's up?

1004
01:00:00,330 --> 01:00:02,266
How you doing, big guy?

1005
01:00:02,299 --> 01:00:05,269
Zane needs a little
advice about women.

1006
01:00:05,302 --> 01:00:07,905
Something you know
a lot about.

1007
01:00:07,938 --> 01:00:10,240
That's for sure.
What is it?

1008
01:00:10,741 --> 01:00:11,976
It's really nothing.

1009
01:00:12,009 --> 01:00:13,410
Nothing.

1010
01:00:13,443 --> 01:00:14,812
He's going out
with this girl
tomorrow night.

1011
01:00:14,845 --> 01:00:16,747
He thinks
she's really special.

1012
01:00:16,781 --> 01:00:18,916
He's kind of nervous,
doesn't know how to act.

1013
01:00:18,949 --> 01:00:20,317
Maybe you can
give him advice.

1014
01:00:22,853 --> 01:00:23,988
Does she do blow?

1015
01:00:24,855 --> 01:00:26,290
I don't think so.

you two guys to talk.
I'll catch you both later.

Well.

01:00:35,232 --> 01:00:37,301
Let me give you
the cardinal rule.

1019
01:00:37,935 --> 01:00:39,369
Fuck her ASAP.

1020
01:00:39,804 --> 01:00:42,973
If you don't,
you're gonna wind up
just being friends.

1021
01:00:43,007 --> 01:00:45,943
God knows,
you don't need
any more friends.

1022
01:00:46,210 --> 01:00:47,778
What if she's not
ready for it?

1023
01:00:47,812 --> 01:00:49,947
They're always
ready for it.

1024
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:52,216
If she says no,
she means yes.

1025
01:00:52,249 --> 01:00:54,685
If she says stop,
she means go.

this many times.

you taking time to give me
advice, but

1029

my advice or you don't.

you won't be
nervous anymore.

Come on, take them.

any weird drugs.

1039

really holding it together
anymore is money.

used to be for free,

beat the system.

negative energy you
put out comes back to you.

comes back to you.

so much good, you know,

happiness, right?

gonna find happiness.

it was unlikely,
not impossible.

the only things
worth doing?

almost impossible?
