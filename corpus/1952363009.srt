00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:10,495
during World War II
and high-tailed it over here.

182
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:11,688
Defector?

183
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:14,925
Just like your notebook's
anonymous writer.

184
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,558
You think he's our man?

185
00:17:16,668 --> 00:17:18,260
Too young then.

186
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,736
But I'd lay odds he knew the guy.
Hell, he probably worked with him.

187
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:24,668
We need to find Dudas.
He knows something.

188
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:27,712
Fella's one hell of a sociopath.

189
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:29,940
Like he dropped off the face
of the earth.

190
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,415
Blew his research, lost his job.

191
00:17:32,518 --> 00:17:36,249
Something God-awful
must have happened to him.

192
00:17:49,601 --> 00:17:50,795
An art gallery?

193
00:17:53,005 --> 00:17:54,097
Do me a favor.

194
00:17:54,273 --> 00:17:57,299
Get me a ticket to this.

195
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:59,775
You got it.

196
00:18:00,779 --> 00:18:05,239
Hoyle, make sure
you're not chasing shadows.

197
00:18:06,351 --> 00:18:10,447
Hey, is she going to pay
for that paper?

198
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:13,415
Thanks!

199
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:25,767
What I'm saying is that if we're
not satisfied with this reality,

200
00:18:25,871 --> 00:18:28,897
we create a new reality,
a more perfect one.

201
00:18:29,007 --> 00:18:30,269
Yes, but perfect for whom?

202
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:32,636
-That's a revisionist reality, isn't it?
-Yes.

203
00:18:32,644 --> 00:18:34,839
And the more the artist
escapes into it,

204
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:37,711
the further he separates himself
from the real world,

205
00:18:37,816 --> 00:18:39,181
real relationships.

206
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:42,481
And thus, therapists make a living.

207
00:18:56,535 --> 00:18:59,436
Salvador Dalí.

208
00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:04,498
"Persistence of Memory." 1931.

209
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:09,707
Wonderful use of browns
in his palette.

210
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:12,750
I'll have to take your word for it.

211
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:17,352
See those cliffs in the background?

212
00:19:17,456 --> 00:19:21,950
They say that's the coast
of Catalonia, Dalí's home.

213
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:26,463
So, he included something familiar,
even among all that decay.

214
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:28,658
The loss of reality.

215
00:19:28,767 --> 00:19:31,600
Or maybe that's the memory
he couldn't escape.

216
00:19:32,437 --> 00:19:34,735
You an art historian?

217
00:19:36,775 --> 00:19:41,712
Couple different things.
Not enough to quit my day job.

218
00:19:41,813 --> 00:19:46,113
Of course, my day job's at night,
but, hey...

219
00:19:51,657 --> 00:19:53,818
I think we're supposed to be
embarrassed by this.

220
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:56,486
Yeah.

221
00:19:56,595 --> 00:19:58,324
You know, I never understood that.

222
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:00,193
Me neither.

223
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:01,766

224
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:03,698
Nice to meet you, Miss Hoyle.

225
00:20:03,802 --> 00:20:04,702
You need a drink?

226
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:08,729
I'm a girl who never drinks,
but knock yourself out.

227
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:11,942
How do you take your brandy, Miss?

228
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:14,772
In a glass.

So, you into surrealist art,

230
00:20:19,851 --> 00:20:23,719
or you just come here
for the fashion?

231
00:20:23,822 --> 00:20:26,222
I'm actually looking for someone.

232
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:31,126
Or he's looking for me.
I'm not sure yet.

233
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,663
SINGER:
Dudas.

234
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:35,767
What do you know about Dudas?

235
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:40,161
I know he's in pain.

236
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:46,476
The human psyche's the most
beautiful thing in the universe.

237
00:20:46,645 --> 00:20:52,345
So resilient, yet so fragile.

238
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:57,282
I want to show you something.

239
00:20:58,156 --> 00:21:01,557
There's a wing through here
that's closed off.

240
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,423
"Urban archaeology."

241
00:21:03,528 --> 00:21:06,497
It's what Dudas
was dabbling in before...

242
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:08,793
You know.

243
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:12,628
A lot of people think it's like
fitting puzzle pieces together,

244
00:21:12,738 --> 00:21:15,639
chunks of life,
divorced from their context.

245
00:21:15,741 --> 00:21:19,541
But I like to think of it
as more like...

246
00:21:19,645 --> 00:21:22,876
like shutting off your left brain,

247
00:21:22,981 --> 00:21:25,779
seeing beauty in things
the way they are,

248
00:21:25,884 --> 00:21:28,751
realizing it's all disconnected--

249
00:21:28,854 --> 00:21:31,880
or connected, in a different way--

250
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:35,448
and being okay with that.

251
00:21:35,727 --> 00:21:38,787
Shutting off your left brain, right.

252
00:21:38,897 --> 00:21:42,799
A lot of cultures say that
you perceive reality more clearly.

253
00:21:42,901 --> 00:21:46,530
Aborigines' dream-time,
Indian peyote rituals,

254
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:49,971
or just plain alcohol, of course.

255
00:21:50,075 --> 00:21:53,272
The choice of the urban shaman.

256
00:21:54,946 --> 00:21:56,379
Give me a puzzle with an answer.

257
00:21:57,416 --> 00:22:00,214
Pieces that fit like they were
made for each other.

258
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:05,922
Things don't always
fit perfectly, Hoyle.

259
00:22:06,024 --> 00:22:10,393
Sometimes it's the rough edges
that make life interesting.

260
00:22:11,296 --> 00:22:16,461
Somebody told me once,
"The mind is like a surge protector."

261
00:22:16,568 --> 00:22:21,369
It prevents you from experiencing
certain things.

262
00:22:21,473 --> 00:22:24,067
Is that what you dragged me
in here to say?

263
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:26,872
You mean non-linear things.

264
00:22:26,978 --> 00:22:31,642

precognition, déjà vu.

How do you know?

269
00:23:09,254 --> 00:23:13,088
What if the surge protector
could fail

270
00:23:13,191 --> 00:23:15,523
from emotional overload?

271

You mean this is some kind
of evidence of-- of precognition?

00:26:08,099 --> 00:26:10,795
I mean that trauma creates ripples.

What are you talking about?

373
00:30:04,669 --> 00:30:07,194
Took a shell in the shoulder, sister.

Okay. I've got a theory.

People say my work

423
00:33:51,796 --> 00:33:55,857
is about fitting disjointed
puzzle pieces together, right?

424
00:33:55,967 --> 00:33:58,527
What if the pieces don't fit?

425
00:33:58,636 --> 00:34:02,766
What if your mind
is like a surge protector?

426
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:04,865
It keeps you from seeing
the disordered nature of time,

427
00:34:04,976 --> 00:34:09,072
and-- and reality, and...

428
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:13,048

00:34:29,033 --> 00:34:30,398
Planck's constant?

Excuse me?

433
00:34:34,005 --> 00:34:36,667
It's the most fundamental constant
in nature.

434
00:34:36,841 --> 00:34:41,335
You see, all the stuff
in the universe is really just waves.

435
00:34:41,446 --> 00:34:43,505
And everything vibrates
at a wavelength,

436
00:34:43,614 --> 00:34:44,979
related to a mathematical constant.

-No, thank you.
-Please.

439
00:34:51,856 --> 00:34:55,087
You know, some people believe
there are other realities,

440
00:34:55,193 --> 00:34:58,959
alternatives, similar to this one,
yet the details are changed.

441
00:34:59,063 --> 00:34:59,963
We can't see them

442
00:34:59,964 --> 00:35:02,626
because they vibrate
at different wavelengths.

443
00:35:02,733 --> 00:35:05,668
And every choice we make
spawns another.

444
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:09,501
It's pretty amazing, huh?

445
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:14,408
A simple decision
can create an entire world.

446
00:35:15,413 --> 00:35:16,937
Or destroy one.

447
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:21,877
Do you remember this time?

448
00:35:22,053 --> 00:35:25,352
This place, this conversation?

449
00:35:28,059 --> 00:35:29,856

450
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:34,864

Not anymore.

451
00:35:41,372 --> 00:35:43,237

maybe you should...

about this again.

453
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:48,101
Yeah. Yeah, I know.
It's one of the reasons.

454
00:35:48,212 --> 00:35:49,873
You ever going to let me know
what the others are?

455
00:35:50,047 --> 00:35:51,036
Oh, please.

456
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:52,514
You know what bothered me
the most?

457
00:35:53,284 --> 00:35:54,649
You pretended
that we were nothing more

458
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:57,915
than peripheral acquaintances.

459
00:35:58,623 --> 00:36:01,387
Something about that struck me
as so disingenuous.

460
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:03,460
This wasn't a good idea.

461
00:36:03,561 --> 00:36:05,552
You haven't moved on.
You haven't moved on.

462
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:09,861
Moved on? I don't even know
what that means-- "moved on!"

463
00:36:09,967 --> 00:36:11,093
Look, I'm not dwelling on you.

464
00:36:11,202 --> 00:36:13,762
I don't sit at home at night, drowning
my self-consciousness in bourbon.

465
00:36:14,906 --> 00:36:18,103
But have I put you away?

466
00:36:18,209 --> 00:36:20,370

475
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:23,934

477
00:38:27,838 --> 00:38:30,102
Wait a minute, I feel like...

478
00:38:30,207 --> 00:38:32,835

-You pay a visit to the university?
-Why?

481
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:43,681
The student there said I wasn't the
only one asking about the notebook.

482
00:38:43,788 --> 00:38:45,050

489
00:39:18,255 --> 00:39:20,382
Hi, Doc.

490
00:39:26,497 --> 00:39:29,022
Well, you aren't crazy.

491
00:39:31,802 --> 00:39:34,134
It's not like you're prone
to cognitive dissociation,

492
00:39:34,238 --> 00:39:35,762
but you're certainly not immune to it.

493
00:39:37,141 --> 00:39:38,665
People can experience
that condition when--

494
00:39:38,776 --> 00:39:40,971
It's not a "condition."

495
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:44,304
Well, from the way
you described these events,

496
00:39:44,415 --> 00:39:45,541
I'd say that's what's going on here.

497
00:39:45,649 --> 00:39:47,480
They're not "events."
It's not that specific.

498
00:39:47,585 --> 00:39:51,749
It's more like-- like just a general
feeling that things are off.

499
00:39:51,856 --> 00:39:52,823
Time is off.

500
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:55,925
But at the same time, it's not.

501
00:39:56,026 --> 00:39:58,551
Look, something
is happening to me,

502
00:39:58,662 --> 00:40:01,130
and I think...

503
00:40:02,533 --> 00:40:04,797
And I think someone's doing this.

504
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:06,665
They're either following me
or they're one step ahead.

505
00:40:06,837 --> 00:40:07,963
-Listen.
-I feel like I'm losing.

506
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:09,733
I need you to tell me
I'm not losing my mind.

507
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:12,707
All right, all right.

508
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:14,641
Look, I want you to take
a deep breath...

509
00:40:14,812 --> 00:40:15,870
Don't patronize me.

510
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:18,949
and tell me
how long you've been here.

511
00:40:20,117 --> 00:40:21,414
I knew you wouldn't believe me.

512
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:23,075
Look, we both know
you have a problem.

513
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:24,687
I haven't been drinking.

514
00:40:28,626 --> 00:40:32,289
I put down a couple, okay?
So, shoot me.

515
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:37,328
You want my help or not?
You called me here for a reason.

516
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:38,766
Yeah.

517
00:40:40,137 --> 00:40:42,264
Yeah, I did.

518
00:40:43,574 --> 00:40:47,772
I keep coming across a term
in something I'm investigating.

519
00:40:47,878 --> 00:40:50,073
Fenestra.

520
00:40:50,181 --> 00:40:52,809
Fenestra aeternitatis.

521
00:40:52,917 --> 00:40:54,714
"Window of eternity."

522
00:40:56,454 --> 00:41:02,051
Jung believed there's
an idealized female archetype

523
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:03,490
deep within a man's psyche.

524
00:41:03,594 --> 00:41:07,724
It's called the "anima."
Latin for "feminine soul."

525
00:41:07,898 --> 00:41:09,297
Yeah.

526
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:13,530
Some feel that this anima
is a sort of bridge

527
00:41:13,637 --> 00:41:18,802
between personal self
and higher knowledge

528
00:41:18,909 --> 00:41:21,844
held in the collective unconscious.

529
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:28,281
When a man falls deeply in love--

530
00:41:28,385 --> 00:41:32,253
when he projects his anima
onto a woman--

531
00:41:32,923 --> 00:41:40,193
she can become
his window to eternity.

532
00:41:41,699 --> 00:41:44,793
Hey, be careful.

533
00:41:44,902 --> 00:41:47,871
You're getting
into some pretty obscure stuff here.

534
00:41:47,972 --> 00:41:50,668
Just trying to figure out
how I fit into it.

535
00:41:50,774 --> 00:41:55,336
I'm a Jungian.
I'm not a fortune teller.

536
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:58,135
[Phone rings]

537
00:43:04,648 --> 00:43:06,309
Hello?

538
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:09,352
Hello?

539
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:30,406
Anybody home?

540
00:44:05,075 --> 00:44:07,339
SINGER:
Can I help you?

541
00:44:08,178 --> 00:44:11,341
Not the kind of stuff
you'd find in a museum, is it?

542
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:17,719
You? You're the psychic?

543
00:44:17,821 --> 00:44:20,654
SINGER:
A girl's gotta make ends meet.

544
00:44:22,126 --> 00:44:24,686
I just help out here
when I'm in town for a gig.

545
00:44:24,795 --> 00:44:29,164
Of course you do.
What a coincidence.

546
00:44:29,266 --> 00:44:31,029
Are you following me?

547
00:44:31,201 --> 00:44:33,032
Whoa, hold on there.

548
00:44:33,137 --> 00:44:35,605
Don't bullshit me. I saw you.

549
00:44:35,706 --> 00:44:40,643
Hoyle, I'm here to help.

550
00:44:40,744 --> 00:44:42,905
You know the arrangement.

551
00:44:43,947 --> 00:44:46,347
You remember?

552
00:44:46,984 --> 00:44:49,384
Yeah.

553
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:52,451
Yeah, I think so.

554
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:55,818
Good.

555
00:44:56,427 --> 00:44:58,088
So...

556
00:44:58,762 --> 00:45:01,322
Again...

557
00:45:02,299 --> 00:45:03,960
Can I help you?

558
00:45:05,803 --> 00:45:08,897
Ask questions. It's your job.

559
00:45:12,843 --> 00:45:14,572
How is Dudas involved in this?

560
00:45:14,678 --> 00:45:17,169
Where is the lab notebook?
Do you know what's in it?

561
00:45:17,281 --> 00:45:21,479
Wait, wait, wait.
These are...

562
00:45:21,585 --> 00:45:25,282
I was thinking more like,
"How's work?"

563
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:26,822
"Do you like this weather?"

564
00:45:26,924 --> 00:45:28,391
"Want to grab a bite?"

565
00:45:31,095 --> 00:45:33,256
Let's grab a bite.

566
00:45:46,043 --> 00:45:48,568
You keep odd hours.

567
00:45:48,679 --> 00:45:51,147
Look who's talking.

568
00:45:53,183 --> 00:45:56,050
I work better in the dark.

569
00:45:57,755 --> 00:45:59,086
I see better.

570
00:45:59,189 --> 00:46:03,319
That's interesting.
I didn't know it worked that way.

571
00:46:03,427 --> 00:46:04,985
Your crystal balls
and your Tarot cards

572
00:46:05,095 --> 00:46:07,791
didn't tell you that, huh?

573
00:46:10,868 --> 00:46:12,563
Check this out.

574
00:46:12,669 --> 00:46:15,297
Run-of-the-mill
sweetener packet, right?

575
00:46:15,405 --> 00:46:16,339
One gram.

576
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:20,574
And there was something
like 5,000 grains in here.

577
00:46:20,677 --> 00:46:22,804
Take my word for it.

578
00:46:24,948 --> 00:46:25,848
Okay.

579
00:46:26,016 --> 00:46:26,948
Okay.

580
00:46:27,050 --> 00:46:29,814
So, how much
did each grain weigh?

581
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:32,480
Total weight
divided by number of grains.

582
00:46:32,656 --> 00:46:33,918
0.2 milligrams.

583
00:46:34,024 --> 00:46:35,924
Really?

584
00:46:36,026 --> 00:46:38,893
How many weighed
exactly 0.2 milligrams?

585
00:46:39,062 --> 00:46:41,326
Well, it's their average weight.
That's the whole point.

586
00:46:41,498 --> 00:46:42,398
No, it's not.

587
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:45,492
The point was to figure out
the weight of each grain.

588
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:51,637
Keep talking.

589
00:46:51,742 --> 00:46:57,772
Formulas only give approximations,
averages based on models.

590
00:46:57,881 --> 00:46:59,940
Science is incomplete.

591
00:47:00,050 --> 00:47:04,316
There's something deeper
we can't define beyond probability.

592
00:47:04,421 --> 00:47:07,049
So, you're about to tell me
that's what mediums do,

593
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:09,091
tap into the deeper level.

594
00:47:09,726 --> 00:47:12,251
I'll let you in on a secret:

595
00:47:12,362 --> 00:47:16,765
Crystal balls and Tarot cards
are just devices

596
00:47:16,867 --> 00:47:19,301
to shut off the conscious mind.

597
00:47:19,403 --> 00:47:22,133
Anything where there are
patterns within chaos.

598
00:47:22,239 --> 00:47:26,141
Lines on a palm,
reflections in a gemstone.

599
00:47:26,243 --> 00:47:27,267
Tea leaves.

600
00:47:28,212 --> 00:47:29,907
SINGER:
There's nothing "magic" about it.

601
00:47:30,914 --> 00:47:33,405
Divination isn't about specifics.

602
00:47:33,584 --> 00:47:36,883
It's about understanding
the patterns of our world,

603
00:47:36,987 --> 00:47:39,512
how they repeat,

604
00:47:39,623 --> 00:47:44,253
creating a "hole"--
a "window to eternity"--

605
00:47:45,028 --> 00:47:47,724
and tapping into the collective.

606
00:47:48,265 --> 00:47:53,066
It's all psychology,
if you believe in that stuff.

607
00:47:56,073 --> 00:47:59,406
What about... numbers?

608
00:47:59,509 --> 00:48:01,875
Symbols.

609
00:48:01,979 --> 00:48:05,415
An intricate sequence.

610
00:48:05,515 --> 00:48:07,380
Could that do the trick?

611
00:48:09,887 --> 00:48:12,378
I'd love to find out, wouldn't you?

612
00:48:16,126 --> 00:48:20,825
We compiled as much urban lore
on the notebook as we could.

613
00:48:20,931 --> 00:48:24,423
Haven't had time
to read through all of it.

614
00:48:26,670 --> 00:48:28,535
Anything grabbing you?

615
00:48:28,639 --> 00:48:31,335
Depends what you have in mind.

616
00:48:31,441 --> 00:48:32,840
[Knocking on door]

617
00:48:34,511 --> 00:48:35,569
Hi.

618
00:48:38,315 --> 00:48:39,976
Hi.

619
00:48:40,851 --> 00:48:44,582
Wow, this gets better and better.

620
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:46,848
You gonna gawk
or you gonna talk?

621
00:48:46,957 --> 00:48:50,222
Oh, yeah. I-- I--

622
00:48:50,327 --> 00:48:53,854
I just want to say I felt bad
about what happened in the lab

623
00:48:53,964 --> 00:48:57,832
because we weren't
very nice to you.

624
00:49:05,175 --> 00:49:06,699
I, uh...

625
00:49:06,810 --> 00:49:10,644
Well, glad to see you're all right,
in any case.

626
00:49:10,747 --> 00:49:13,944
Good. Good.

627
00:49:19,823 --> 00:49:21,222
All right.

628
00:49:22,526 --> 00:49:25,984
Do you want anything?
A glass of water? Coffee?

629
00:49:26,096 --> 00:49:27,290
I'm fine, thanks.

630
00:49:27,397 --> 00:49:29,388
-Bourbon?
-Please.

631
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:35,003
So, you think maybe...

632
00:49:35,105 --> 00:49:39,474
If you were free,
if you might be interested in...

633
00:49:41,578 --> 00:49:43,136
Sorry.

634
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:54,719
Look, I know what you guys
are going to ask me,

635
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:58,488
but I can't squeal
about that notebook.

636
00:49:58,595 --> 00:49:59,926
There's no way.

637
00:50:00,097 --> 00:50:01,997
So, they say this notebook
hasn't been seen

638
00:50:02,099 --> 00:50:04,226
since the Second World War, right?

639
00:50:04,334 --> 00:50:07,394
Some of the greatest minds
in 20th-century physics

640
00:50:07,504 --> 00:50:10,667
worked for these underground
societies in Germany back then.

641
00:50:10,774 --> 00:50:15,370
I'm talking nontraditional research.
Alchemy, occult arts.

642
00:50:15,479 --> 00:50:17,703
-Really?
-Yeah. We're only beginning to understand

643
00:50:17,814 --> 00:50:19,338
the consequences of their work.

644
00:50:19,449 --> 00:50:21,644
Most of it was never made public.

645
00:50:21,752 --> 00:50:23,515
That's fascinating.

646
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:27,716
So, this backdoor research
you're doing, how does it fit in?

647
00:50:28,759 --> 00:50:31,353
Let me set the scene first.

648
00:50:31,461 --> 00:50:34,021
How do you know
where you are in life?

649
00:50:34,131 --> 00:50:36,497
You're asking the wrong gal.

650
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:39,296
Seriously, how do you know?

651
00:50:40,103 --> 00:50:42,037
Your memories.

652
00:50:42,139 --> 00:50:48,738
Okay, think of time as a row,
a sequence that always exists.

653
00:50:48,845 --> 00:50:51,507
You orient yourself
in the sequence--

654
00:50:51,615 --> 00:50:54,743
you know "when" you are
by looking at what's behind you.

655
00:50:54,851 --> 00:50:58,287
What's supposed to have
just happened, your past.

656
00:50:58,388 --> 00:51:01,983
You can't see the future,
but that doesn't mean it's not there.

657
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:04,160
Go on.

658
00:51:04,161 --> 00:51:07,224
Now, what if you were jumping
from place to place in the row.

659
00:51:07,330 --> 00:51:08,797
You wouldn't know the difference,
would you?

660
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:11,026
Because at any point, you'd only
be able to see what's behind you,

661
00:51:11,134 --> 00:51:13,159
what's supposed to have
just happened.

662
00:51:13,270 --> 00:51:15,170
So you're saying
that everything that I experience--

663
00:51:15,272 --> 00:51:17,706
I'm saying linear time is a myth,

664
00:51:17,808 --> 00:51:20,038
an illusion forced on you
by your left brain.

665
00:51:20,143 --> 00:51:23,169
You don't live life in order,
you just think you do.

666
00:51:24,114 --> 00:51:25,809
Hold on.

667
00:51:27,150 --> 00:51:28,913
I've heard this theory.

668
00:51:29,019 --> 00:51:31,419
What if I told you it's not a theory?

669
00:51:32,055 --> 00:51:34,421
A few decades ago, Feynman
and Wheeler cooked up something

670
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:35,956
called "time-reversal symmetry."

671
00:51:36,059 --> 00:51:37,526
The idea is that everything
in the universe

672
00:51:37,627 --> 00:51:39,424
is actually the same stuff--

673
00:51:39,529 --> 00:51:43,727
existing over and over again
in different places, different states.

674
00:51:43,834 --> 00:51:48,328
Back up a minute.
Different places at the same time.

675
00:51:48,438 --> 00:51:50,372
It's been known to happen.
It's called a "cat state."

676
00:51:50,474 --> 00:51:52,442
A side-effect
of nonlocal entanglement,

677
00:51:52,609 --> 00:51:54,133
what Einstein called
"spooky action."

678
00:51:54,244 --> 00:51:55,609
Cut to the chase, kid.

679
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:58,505
Don't you see?

680
00:51:58,615 --> 00:52:01,880
Extend the metaphor
to people, thoughts.

681
00:52:01,985 --> 00:52:03,953
The same consciousness...

682
00:52:04,054 --> 00:52:06,522
Skipping back-and-forth
through time,

683
00:52:06,690 --> 00:52:09,625
forever re-experiencing realities
from other perspectives

684
00:52:09,726 --> 00:52:13,560
like some cosmic 'clerk'
is shuffling different events,

685
00:52:13,730 --> 00:52:20,067
different lives, only giving
the appearance of distinct selves.

686
00:52:22,239 --> 00:52:24,104
Okay.

687
00:52:25,842 --> 00:52:31,280
Even if what you say is true,
why all the cloak-and-dagger?

688
00:52:37,754 --> 00:52:41,713
Certain knowledge...
it can be dangerous.

689
00:52:55,071 --> 00:52:56,436
Try me.

690
00:53:02,546 --> 00:53:07,540
You know, I wouldn't be telling
you guys this if you were... guys.

691
00:53:08,251 --> 00:53:10,116
No kidding.

692
00:53:11,521 --> 00:53:13,079
All right.

693
00:53:13,757 --> 00:53:15,088
All right.

694
00:53:23,934 --> 00:53:27,927
Some cutting edge paraphysicists
in Europe

695
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:32,338
are conducting
thought experiments

696
00:53:32,442 --> 00:53:37,971
into ways that time-- reality--
can be reversed.

697
00:53:38,081 --> 00:53:42,381
The idea is that, if you could
experience true non-linear time--

698
00:53:42,485 --> 00:53:45,454
what some call "dream time"--

699
00:53:45,555 --> 00:53:52,256
then you could interfere with reality,
just by making choices in your life.

700
00:53:52,762 --> 00:53:56,323
Would there be any observable
phenomena associated with this?

701
00:53:56,433 --> 00:53:57,730
Side-effects?

702
00:53:57,834 --> 00:53:59,165
Like...?

703
00:53:59,269 --> 00:54:01,863
Uh, electrical?

704
00:54:01,972 --> 00:54:04,167
I don't know. Maybe.

705
00:54:04,274 --> 00:54:06,333
But you think the answer's
in the notebook?

706
00:54:06,443 --> 00:54:09,003
That's just it.
We don't have the notebook.

707
00:54:09,112 --> 00:54:12,275
Nobody knows where it is.

708
00:54:14,818 --> 00:54:16,080
Somebody knows.

709
00:54:30,533 --> 00:54:34,196
"Let us go, through certain
half-deserted streets,

710
00:54:34,304 --> 00:54:35,362
The muttering retreats

711
00:54:35,472 --> 00:54:39,841
Of restless nights
in one-night cheap hotels."

712
00:54:42,746 --> 00:54:45,715
He can't love, you know.

713
00:54:45,815 --> 00:54:48,375
That's why Prufrock wanders
through half-deserted streets.

714
00:54:48,485 --> 00:54:52,012
He won't allow himself to love.

715
00:54:52,689 --> 00:54:55,180
Do you think he's right?

716
00:54:55,292 --> 00:54:59,422
Do you think that's the system?
The way things work?

717
00:55:02,332 --> 00:55:05,199
Kinda out there, isn't it?

718
00:55:07,237 --> 00:55:13,733
What if someone could perceive
linear and non-linear time?

719
00:55:15,812 --> 00:55:20,340
If something happened--
something happened to the sequence

720
00:55:20,450 --> 00:55:24,887
so that you could interact
with memories,

721
00:55:24,988 --> 00:55:27,752
change them.

722
00:55:29,492 --> 00:55:30,550
Well, that would mean--

723
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:34,562
It would mean something's off,
something's not working right.

724
00:55:34,664 --> 00:55:37,531
A jam in the cycle.

725
00:55:37,634 --> 00:55:40,034
A jam in the cycle.

726
00:55:40,136 --> 00:55:42,570
The totality
of human consciousness,

727
00:55:42,672 --> 00:55:49,373
accumulated, rarefied,
distilled in one person

728
00:55:49,479 --> 00:55:51,504
without even being aware of it.

729
00:56:00,423 --> 00:56:02,914
Tell me one thing.

730
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:04,850
Why?

731
00:56:08,765 --> 00:56:11,359
You broke something.

732
00:56:16,806 --> 00:56:17,706
Wait!

733
00:56:18,942 --> 00:56:20,603
Wait.

734
00:56:22,779 --> 00:56:25,509
What if something you did--
if something somebody did--

735
00:56:25,615 --> 00:56:28,982
caused the system to bottleneck,
to fragment?

736
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:32,781
What makes you think
you could fix it?

737
00:56:32,956 --> 00:56:35,390
Well, what would you do?
Wouldn't you eventually try...

738
00:56:35,558 --> 00:56:39,494
Come on, Hoyle.
It doesn't mean anything.

739
00:56:39,596 --> 00:56:42,258
Forget about it.

740
00:56:44,334 --> 00:56:45,494
Listen to me!

741
00:56:45,602 --> 00:56:49,368
If it were true,
what would you do?

742
00:56:51,474 --> 00:56:56,241
Well, I guess...

743
00:56:56,346 --> 00:56:58,940
Once you realized--

744
00:56:59,048 --> 00:57:04,987
at least, once you suspected
what was happening--

745
00:57:06,289 --> 00:57:09,315
I'd say you'd try to warn yourself.

746
00:57:09,426 --> 00:57:12,452
Get a message through.

747
00:57:13,096 --> 00:57:16,930
At first, it would probably be
little things--

748
00:57:17,033 --> 00:57:23,404
phone calls, e-mails, pictures.

749
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:29,803
But after a while,
as you got better at it,

750
00:57:29,913 --> 00:57:35,579
as you learned to manipulate
the rules of the chess game,

751
00:57:35,685 --> 00:57:39,781
you'd leave subtler clues,

752
00:57:39,889 --> 00:57:47,193
you'd try to create thoughts,
dreams, feelings,

753
00:57:47,297 --> 00:57:49,629
people.

754
00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:54,403
I'll never catch on.

755
00:57:55,305 --> 00:57:56,704
I'll never get through, will I?

756
00:57:56,806 --> 00:58:00,367
It doesn't mean you can't keep trying.

757
00:58:01,744 --> 00:58:04,406
Maybe you need a little help.

758
00:58:05,815 --> 00:58:08,579
Walk me to my room.

759
00:58:20,063 --> 00:58:22,691
Come on.

760
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:51,944
Hello?

I'm the Clerk.

01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:39,432
You're not real.

771
01:00:40,203 --> 01:00:43,661
John, I think it might be a good idea
if you stopped this,

772
01:00:43,773 --> 01:00:44,705
all of this.

773
01:00:44,807 --> 01:00:46,206
I don't know
what you're talking about.

774
01:00:46,309 --> 01:00:48,140
I'm talking about reveling
in your own misery

775
01:00:48,244 --> 01:00:52,578
because you're too goddamn afraid
to turn a corner.

776
01:00:56,953 --> 01:00:59,751
John, there are other people
looking for this thing,

777
01:00:59,856 --> 01:01:02,518
dangerous people.

01:01:05,428 --> 01:01:08,420
You coming or not?

HOYLE:
John, honey, listen to me.

780
01:01:34,557 --> 01:01:38,459
I think-- I think you're going to set
something in motion here,

781
01:01:38,561 --> 01:01:40,358
something you can't stop.

782
01:01:40,463 --> 01:01:41,691
You know what I think?

783
01:01:41,798 --> 01:01:42,992
I think you picked a hell of a time

784
01:01:43,099 --> 01:01:45,727
to start worrying
about what happens to me.

785
01:01:45,835 --> 01:01:47,700

It's okay. It's not that bad.

Yes.

Everybody's worried about you.

817
01:05:32,929 --> 01:05:35,989
It stopped, you know.

818
01:05:36,899 --> 01:05:39,663
I go through the motions.
Everyday, mechanical existence.

819
01:05:39,835 --> 01:05:44,534
But... time stopped.

01:05:45,207 --> 01:05:49,200
Look, hurting you
wasn't easy for me,

821

but life is hurt.

01:05:51,514 --> 01:05:54,415
It's trial and error sometimes--
that's how we find ourselves.

823
01:05:54,517 --> 01:05:57,975
The errors injure others.

824
01:05:58,087 --> 01:06:01,750
That pain goes somewhere.
Where do you think that pain goes?

825
01:06:01,857 --> 01:06:07,056
It goes from one person to the next.
It becomes part of the cycle.

And you know
what the most terrifying...

the most exhilarating part is?

828
01:06:18,107 --> 01:06:22,373
Our capacity to not get over
the past--

829
01:06:22,478 --> 01:06:27,006
our sincere desire not to move on.

on their own significance, don't they?

890
01:13:40,048 --> 01:13:40,948
Wait!

891
01:13:42,217 --> 01:13:45,015
Let him. It's all right.

892
01:13:50,292 --> 01:13:52,522
Open it.

893
01:13:54,062 --> 01:13:55,825
Go ahead, open it.

894
01:14:06,508 --> 01:14:08,373
You're looking in the wrong place.

895
01:14:09,878 --> 01:14:15,282
It's not about a notebook.
It was never about a notebook.

896
01:14:15,384 --> 01:14:20,754
You still think there's some formula
that could explain all this?

897
01:14:20,856 --> 01:14:21,756
No.

898
01:14:21,824 --> 01:14:25,555
No, no. I am not crazy.

899
01:14:28,497 --> 01:14:30,761
How is this happening to me?

900
01:14:30,866 --> 01:14:32,197
You made a choice.

901
01:14:32,367 --> 01:14:35,200
For John, it was the wrong choice.

902
01:14:35,370 --> 01:14:36,735
It was the right one for me!

903
01:14:36,905 --> 01:14:39,533
Then why do you keep
coming back here?

904
01:14:42,077 --> 01:14:45,308
Choices have consequences, Hoyle.

905
01:14:45,481 --> 01:14:47,711
No, no.

906
01:14:50,419 --> 01:14:53,582
Look, you're dealing
with the tip of something

907
01:14:53,689 --> 01:14:57,420
that really isn't comprehensible.

908
01:14:57,526 --> 01:15:01,826
Your mind
chaining dissociated events

909
01:15:01,930 --> 01:15:05,991
from different perspectives,
different realities,

910
01:15:06,101 --> 01:15:08,797
into some kind of coherent story.

911
01:15:08,904 --> 01:15:10,428
You mean experiencing dream time.

912
01:15:10,539 --> 01:15:14,305
I mean experiencing regret.

913
01:15:14,409 --> 01:15:17,344
I don't care if you attribute it
to your loneliness,

914
01:15:17,446 --> 01:15:21,746
or your need to connect,
or your guilt over hurting him.

915
01:15:23,886 --> 01:15:25,251
He speaks to you.

916
01:15:27,155 --> 01:15:34,687
He sees you all the time
in his heart.

917
01:15:36,031 --> 01:15:38,261
When he wakes up

918
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:44,067
and realizes
you're no longer there...

919
01:15:45,207 --> 01:15:51,942
chaos, disorder
come rushing in again.

920
01:15:57,886 --> 01:16:01,686
You were an important part of him.

921
01:16:02,591 --> 01:16:07,119
That doesn't just evaporate
when you decide it does.

922
01:16:07,896 --> 01:16:10,456
What are you saying?

923
01:16:11,366 --> 01:16:15,268
He's putting himself into my life?

924
01:16:15,971 --> 01:16:19,031
Or the other way around?

925
01:16:21,910 --> 01:16:25,073
<i>* Where do you start?</i>

926
01:16:27,716 --> 01:16:35,350
<i>* How do you separate the present
from the past?</i>

927
01:16:37,492 --> 01:16:45,695
<i>* How do you deal with all the things
you thought would last?</i>

928
01:16:48,070 --> 01:16:50,732
<i>* That didn't last?</i>

929
01:16:53,008 --> 01:16:57,570
<i>* With bits of memories
scattered here and there</i>

930
01:16:59,281 --> 01:17:05,049
<i>* I look around
and don't know where to start</i>

931
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:18,396
<i>* Which books are yours?</i>

932
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:24,029
<i>* Which tapes and dreams
belong to you</i>

933
01:17:24,139 --> 01:17:26,573
<i>* And which are mine?</i>

934
01:17:28,343 --> 01:17:36,580
<i>* Our lives are tangled
like the branches of a vine</i>

935
01:17:38,687 --> 01:17:41,383
<i>* That intertwine</i>

936
01:17:44,059 --> 01:17:48,553
<i>* So many habits
that we'll have to break</i>

937
01:17:49,731 --> 01:17:55,636
<i>* And yesterdays
we'll have to take apart</i>

938
01:17:57,673 --> 01:18:01,074
<i>* Someday there'll be a song</i>

939
01:18:01,243 --> 01:18:06,340
<i>* Or something in the air again</i>

940
01:18:08,016 --> 01:18:12,476
<i>* To catch me by surprise</i>

941
01:18:12,587 --> 01:18:17,251
<i>* And you'll be there again</i>

942
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:22,418
<i>* A moment in...</i>

943
01:18:23,832 --> 01:18:27,928
<i>* What might have been</i>

944
01:18:30,205 --> 01:18:33,333
<i>* Where do you start?</i>

945
01:18:33,442 --> 01:18:40,644
<i>* Do you allow yourself
a little time to cry?</i>

946
01:18:42,784 --> 01:18:51,192
<i>* Or do you close your eyes
and kiss it all good-bye?</i>

947
01:18:52,861 --> 01:18:55,227
<i>* I guess you try</i>

948
01:18:58,100 --> 01:19:02,434
<i>* And though I don't know where,
and don't know when</i>

949
01:19:02,537 --> 01:19:07,167
<i>* I'll find myself in love again</i>

950
01:19:07,275 --> 01:19:11,507
<i>* I promise there will always be</i>

951
01:19:11,613 --> 01:19:17,279
<i>* A little place no one can see</i>

952
01:19:17,385 --> 01:19:22,186
<i>* A tiny part, deep in my heart</i>

953
01:19:22,290 --> 01:19:29,219
<i>* That stays in love</i>

954
01:19:31,366 --> 01:19:35,530
<i>* With you</i>
