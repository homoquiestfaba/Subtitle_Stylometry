He's cool too.

178
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,780
And that is Mrs. Plotkin.

179
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:19,080
Everyone says she's mean.

180
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:27,390
That is so funny.

181
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:30,320
I have to be
in Miss Cole's class.

182
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:33,130
I mean, look at her.
She's beautiful

183
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,290
and smart and confident.

184
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:37,730
She even dresses
the way I wish I could.

185
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:40,300
There's no way
I would be such a loser

186
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:43,340
if I could just learn
from her.

187
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:45,640
Okay, everybody,
please listen.

188
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:48,470
Each teacher will read
a list of students.

189
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:52,350
When you hear your name,
please line up in front
of your teacher.

190
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:54,410
I'll begin.

191
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:56,150
Gary Anderson,

192
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:57,750
David Bower,

193
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,450
Stephanie Brooks,

194
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:01,320
Joshua Gluckman,

195
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,060
Gillian Lambert,

196
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:04,620
Patrick Loughton,

197
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:06,260
Alice McKinley,

198
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:07,290
Judy MacInerney,

199
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:09,400
Amy Roger,

200
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:10,800
Brendan Scott,

201
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:12,770
Brianna Trenton,

202
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,370
Julia Turner,

203
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,840
Michelle Winston,

204
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:17,340
Charlie Williams,
Hey.

205
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:18,770
and Leslie Woods.
Don't I know you?

206
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:20,840
I don't think so.
I'm new.

207
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,710
What-- You're that girl
from the store.
Oh, my gosh!

208
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:25,910
[books thud]

209
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:58,610
His name's Patrick,
and he doesn't care at all

210
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:00,780
that I've seen him
in his underwear.

211
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,250
What am I supposed
to say now?

212
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,550
"Were those
Fruit of the Looms?"

213
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:07,320
[shudders]
Guys are weird.

214
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:18,970
Good morning.
I'm Mrs. Plotkin,

215
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,070
and as you all know
by now, I'm considered

216
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,000
the toughest
6th grade teacher.

217
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,940
Well, it's true.

218
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:27,710
I believe in challenging
my students.

219
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,740
You may not
like it now,

220
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:31,810
but in 10 years you'll
probably thank me.

221
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:38,920
Alice.
Is that correct?

222
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,260
I think I'm in
the wrong class.

223
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:44,260
Wrong class?

224
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:45,630
No, can't be.

225
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:48,060
You're on my class list.
Okay, so--

226
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:51,230
No, I'm supposed to be
in Miss Cole's class.

227
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,830
My dad called weeks ago.

228
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:54,830
I'm certain
the list is wrong.

229
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:00,640
The names are generated
through a computer

230
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,410
and chosen randomly,
Alice.

231
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,480
Perhaps your father
misunderstood.

232
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:07,080
No, I'm really supposed
to be in Miss Cole's room.

233
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,150
That's what he told me.

234
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:12,850
Perhaps you'd like
to take it up

235
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:15,290
with Mr. Edgecombe,
the principal.

236
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,590
Yes.

237
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:19,590
Come on up here.

238
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:20,790
Get your hall pass.
Come on.

239
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,100
He's right down the hall.

240
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:27,430
Go, quick.
Go, go.

241
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:35,140
His office
is right down
the hall that way.

242
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,490
What can I do
for you?

243
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,090
I know names
are chosen randomly,

244
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:52,690
but my dad said he
really wanted me

245
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:54,090
to be in Miss Cole's class,

246
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:56,530
'cause he said that
she's cool and confident,

247
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,830
and he said that she's
the most amazing person ever,

248
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:01,000
so he really wanted me
to be in her class.

249
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,370
Your dad said that, right?

250
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:07,170
Okay, when was this?

251
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,280
Last week, um...

252
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:12,710
because we just moved here.

253
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:14,350
Well, if you are
new to our school,

254
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:15,550
you wouldn't know
very much

255
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:17,920
about any of our teachers,
now, would you?

256
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,550
We found it's best

257
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:21,720
not to play
musical chairs

258
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,720
with our classrooms.

259
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,660
And I like to believe
that all 3

260
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:27,190
of our 6th grade teachers
are excellent, Alice.

261
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:28,900
Now...

262
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:31,160
I'm sure that if you
put forth the effort,

263
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,870
you'll find that
you and Mrs. Plotkin

264
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,170
will get along just fine.

265
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,840
All right?

266
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,920
[Miss Cole]
Okay. Joke of the day.

267
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:53,120
What did baby corn say
to mommy corn?

268
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:56,090
I don't know. What?
"Where's popcorn?"

269
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,990
[all laughing]

270
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:59,930
I know what
I just did was wrong,

271
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,190
and I should never lie,

272
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:04,160
but when I look
at Miss Cole,

273
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,900
I can't help myself.

274
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:09,570
That's awesome.
Okay, Hailey,
your turn.

275
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:13,110
So, how was
the first day?

276
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:15,880
Killer.
Guys are cool,
girls are hot,

277
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:18,580
and I'm already
talking about
starting a band.

278
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:21,250
Right on.
How about you, Alice?

279
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,050
Well, I got elected
class president

280
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,620
after being there
for 5 minutes.

281
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:26,690
Wow.
Congratulations.

282
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,250
I'm kidding, Dad.

283
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:30,360
I have no friends,

284
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:32,490
and I got the worst teacher
in the whole school.

285
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:33,630
I just want to go home.

286
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:35,560
I thought you
wanted pizza.

287
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,830
No, our real home.

288
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:40,770
Okay.
This is our home now.

289
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,900
I explained to you guys

290
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:44,040
how important it is for me

291
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:45,910
to own that
music store, okay?

292
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:48,040
It was the first day.
I'm sure it'll get better.

293
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,580
I don't know anyone.
I feel like a freak.

294
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:52,910
Making friends
is the hard part,

295
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:55,080
but I'm sure that
you will, and soon.

296
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,320
I'm not like Lester.
He already has a band

297
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:00,320
and a bunch
of groupies.

298
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,650
Yeah, but when
he was your age,

299
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:03,760
he was very shy.

300
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:05,760
Mom and I, we decided
he was so immature,

301
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:07,790
we'd keep him
back a year.

302
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:09,500
You said I got
the chicken pox

303
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:10,900
and fell behind
in school.

304
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:12,770
Well, now you're old enough
to know the truth.

305
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:16,370
Thanks, Dad.
You just made my day.

306
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,940
That's funny.

307
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:19,270
Feel better now?

308
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:22,210
A little.
But Mrs. Plotkin
still stinks.

309
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:34,590
Oh, look.
Hey, Pamela,
this is Alice.

310
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,720
Patrick is telling
all the guys at school
to watch out for you.

311
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,560
No, that was just
a mistake, that's all.

312
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,760
Okay, I maybe saw
his underwear.

313
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:48,430
[chuckles]
That's great.
Wait until I tell everyone.

314
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:51,770
Hey, listen to what
the new girl

315
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:53,470
has to say about
Patrick...

316
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:55,940
No, I didn't mean
for you--
[gasps]

317
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:58,010
[laughing, chattering]

318
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:04,520
Yeah.

319
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:06,650
Things are really
looking up.

320
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,870
[Mrs. Plotkin]
I always like
to end the day by

321
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:22,170
reading a book
to my class.

322
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:25,700
Every year we start
with my favorite novel,

323
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,710
The Adventures
of Tom Sawyer

324
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:30,580
by Mark Twain.

325
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:33,980
There's got to be
another way that I can
get in Miss Cole's class.

326
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:37,920
"'Tom? Tom?

327
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:40,850
"'What's gone with
that boy, I wonder.
Tom?'"

328
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:45,120
"The old lady pulled
her spectacles down

329
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,790
"and looked over them
around the room.

330
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,330
"Then she put them up
and looked under them.
[snoring]

331
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:57,040
"She seldom or never
looked through them

332
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:58,870
"for so small a thing
as a boy.

333
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:01,370
"They were her state pair,
the pride of her heart,
[snoring loudly]

334
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:04,080
and were built for style,
not service."

335
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:06,580
Alice!
[children chuckling]

336
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:12,090
[bell rings]
Okay, kids, don't forget
to read the first chapter

337
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:14,690
in your American history
book for tomorrow.

338
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,060
Alice, I'd like
to speak with you.

339
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:20,060
Sit, please.

340
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:25,230
You know, it's apparent
you don't want to be
in this class.

341
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:28,100
And quite frankly,
with the behavior
you're carrying on,

342
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:30,240
I don't particularly
want you in my class.

343
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:32,810
Sorry.

344
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,570
I'm going to have
to schedule

345
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:36,710
a meeting
with your parents.

346
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,410
No.

347
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:40,210
You leave me no choice.

348
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:41,880
My dad just opened
a new store.

349
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,420
He's really busy.

350
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:44,780
Well, then,
your mother's gonna have

a school musical this year--
"The Princess and the Frog."

And we've even managed
to rent a local theatre
for the performance,

a special production.

694
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:05,120
You're going out tonight?
Yeah, just dinner
with a friend.

695
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:07,830
That woman?
Kelly.

696
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:10,460
Is it, like,
a date?

697
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,860
Kind of.

698
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:16,830
Okay. I guess
that's okay with me.

00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:18,400

Mm-hmm.

700
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,400
Great.

701
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:23,540
Hey, can you sign this?
What is it?

702
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:28,350
It's a detention slip.
Alice!

703
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:29,880
It's Mrs. Plotkin.

704
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,720
I was a little late for
a report. That's all.

705
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:33,650
I thought we agreed that
this theatre club thing

706
00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:35,620
wasn't gonna interfere
with your schoolwork.

707
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:37,690
It didn't, Dad.
I just forgot.

708
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:39,590
I think you're gonna have
to forget the theatre club

709
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:40,990
until the schoolwork
gets in order.

710
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:43,060
Dad, tomorrow are
the final auditions.

711
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:44,830
I'll stay up all night
and write this report.

712
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:46,500
I'll write
an extra hundred words.

713
00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:49,170
I promise. Just--
I'll never do it again.

714

150 words.

00:46:54,170 --> 00:46:57,740
There is no "right thing"
with an 11-year-old girl.

870
00:47:06,290 --> 00:47:08,750
Oh, Alice,
I wanted to
speak to you.

871
00:47:08,790 --> 00:47:11,260
Since you've finished
all your work,

872
00:47:11,290 --> 00:47:13,020
I figured you could
skip detention today

873
00:47:13,060 --> 00:47:14,790
and go to play
rehearsal, okay?

874
00:47:14,830 --> 00:47:17,300
Thanks, Mrs. Plotkin,

875
00:47:17,330 --> 00:47:19,460
but I'm only Frog #3.

876
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:21,430
Oh, I know
Miss Cole feels

877
00:47:21,470 --> 00:47:24,100
every part is
very important.

878
00:47:24,140 --> 00:47:25,400
And I thought you
were looking forward

879
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:27,070
to performing in front
of the whole school.

880
00:47:28,610 --> 00:47:32,140
I didn't really care
about the part.
I just...

881
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:35,510
I wanted to be with...
Miss Cole?

882
00:47:37,450 --> 00:47:41,020
Well, if so, why,
you could do that.

883
00:47:41,050 --> 00:47:42,850
Really?

884
00:47:42,890 --> 00:47:43,990
Well, I'm sure she's
bogged down

885
00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:45,660
with a lot of work
doing this musical.

886
00:47:45,690 --> 00:47:47,860
Maybe you could help her
after school like you did
for me.

887
00:47:47,890 --> 00:47:49,990
You think so?
It's worth a shot.

888
00:47:50,030 --> 00:47:52,660
Why don't you ask her?
She's over there.

889
00:47:55,530 --> 00:47:58,070
Thanks.
I think I'll do that.

890
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:03,310
Hi, Miss Cole.

891
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:04,910
Oh, hi, Alice.
Hi.

892
00:48:04,940 --> 00:48:07,280
I was wondering
if I could maybe
help you decorate,

893
00:48:07,310 --> 00:48:09,380
or if you need any
help with anything.

894
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:11,650
Sure, sure.
Yeah, I could
use some help.

895
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:12,680
Okay.

896
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:14,090
[chattering]

897
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:30,670
Hey.
Hey.

898
00:48:35,110 --> 00:48:37,810
You and Dad okay?
I guess.

899
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:40,480
I think you
should give him a chance.

900
00:48:40,510 --> 00:48:42,050
He's trying the best he can.

901
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:45,320
What's up with him
and that Kelly lady?

902
00:48:45,350 --> 00:48:47,790
I don't know.
I think he likes her.

903
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:52,060
Well, he wouldn't
get married, would he?

904
00:48:52,090 --> 00:48:54,130
Who knows?

905
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:56,930
But you'd better get
used to the idea, Al,
'cause it could happen.

906
00:48:58,630 --> 00:49:00,660
If Dad was gonna
marry someone,

907
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:03,900
they'd have to be
really, really special.

908
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:09,940
Thanks.

909
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:18,120
Hey, Marilyn.
Sorry I forgot
to tell you

910
00:49:18,150 --> 00:49:20,550
I'd be working today,
but maybe we can get
together later.

911
00:49:20,590 --> 00:49:24,260
That's okay.
I'm here to see Lester.

912
00:49:26,990 --> 00:49:28,860
Hey, Lester.

913
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:33,060
Hey, Marilyn.
What are you doing here?

914
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:35,000
I was just finishing some
shopping down the street,

915
00:49:35,030 --> 00:49:37,170
and I thought I'd stop by
to see if maybe you wanted

916
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:38,870
to walk home together.

917
00:49:41,470 --> 00:49:43,440
[whispering]
I'm really busy
right now.

918
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:46,710
Um, can I call you back,
like, later?

919
00:49:46,750 --> 00:49:48,580
Why are you whispering?

920
00:49:48,610 --> 00:49:51,750
Oh, I don't want
to bother the customers.

921
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:54,050
Um, I got to go
downstairs, but...

922
00:49:54,090 --> 00:49:56,990
Lester,
why is Marilyn here?

923
00:49:57,020 --> 00:49:58,220
Uh-oh.

924
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:00,260
I-I don't know.

925
00:50:00,290 --> 00:50:01,890
Are you seeing her?

926
00:50:04,730 --> 00:50:05,860
Kind of.

927
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:07,430
What's that supposed
to mean?

928
00:50:07,470 --> 00:50:09,930
Yeah, what is that
supposed to mean?

929
00:50:09,970 --> 00:50:12,840
I didn't even know
you guys were friends.

930
00:50:12,870 --> 00:50:14,810
Well, we are.

931
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:16,370
Yeah, we are.

932
00:50:16,410 --> 00:50:20,110
And we're also friends
with just about every
girl in school.

933
00:50:20,150 --> 00:50:21,610
Who are all going
to know

934
00:50:21,650 --> 00:50:23,110
what a slime ball

935
00:50:23,150 --> 00:50:24,380
you are.

936
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:28,420
Is there something
I can do?

937
00:50:28,450 --> 00:50:30,150
How about dropping dead?

938
00:50:31,620 --> 00:50:33,490
You want to go to
the movies tonight?
Sure.

939
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:36,530
I get off at 6.
I'll come by.
Great.

940
00:50:43,670 --> 00:50:46,200
Guess there's a downside
to making friends easily.

941
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:56,710
Okay.

942
00:50:56,750 --> 00:50:57,850
I'm done, Miss Cole.

943
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:00,780
That's excellent work, Alice.

944
00:51:00,820 --> 00:51:02,520
I just wish I could
take you home

945
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:03,850
and have you straighten up
my apartment.

946
00:51:03,890 --> 00:51:05,060
Oh, I'd be happy to.

947
00:51:06,660 --> 00:51:08,630
I'm only kidding.

948
00:51:08,660 --> 00:51:10,660
Well, not about me
being a slob.

949
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:12,060
I'm a total mess.

950
00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:14,730
Why? You always
look so neat.

951
00:51:14,770 --> 00:51:17,370
Mmm, it's all
an illusion.

952
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:19,540
You know us girls.
We have our ways, right?

953
00:51:19,570 --> 00:51:21,410
Right.

954
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:23,410
You know, Alice,

955
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:26,310
I was just considering
changing a part of the play,

956
00:51:26,350 --> 00:51:28,610
and I think you might be
perfect for the part I need.

957
00:51:28,650 --> 00:51:30,480
Really?
Yeah.

958
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:33,150
You'll still be a frog,
but I was considering

959
00:51:33,190 --> 00:51:35,320
giving one of the frogs
a larger role.

960
00:51:35,350 --> 00:51:37,890
The Frog Prince's
right-hand man--

961
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:39,560
or woman, in this case.

962
00:51:39,590 --> 00:51:41,930
It won't be much of a change
from what you're doing now,

963
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:44,630
but you'll have a great moment
in the first act.

964
00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:46,760
A small dance number.
Would you be up for it?

965
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:49,170
Definitely.
Great.

966
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:52,040
Well, then, I'll see you
at rehearsal later
in the week.

967
00:51:52,070 --> 00:51:53,300
I'm really looking
forward to this.

968
00:51:53,340 --> 00:51:54,310
Me too.

969
00:51:54,340 --> 00:51:57,210
[chuckles]
See you then.

970
00:51:57,240 --> 00:52:00,610
Okay, it may not be
the Princess role,
but it's almost as good.

971
00:52:00,650 --> 00:52:02,980
My own dance solo?

972
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:04,450
Just 'cause I can't sing

973
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:07,020
doesn't mean I can't be
a star.

974
00:52:07,050 --> 00:52:09,190
6, 7, 8.

975
00:52:09,220 --> 00:52:11,890
1, 2, 3, 4.

976
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:14,790
Down, down, down.

977
00:52:14,830 --> 00:52:17,600
Head, head.
Jump, jump.

978
00:52:17,630 --> 00:52:19,800
Okay, you try it.
Okay.

979
00:52:28,410 --> 00:52:30,510
[bell rings]
Jump, jump.

980
00:52:30,540 --> 00:52:33,080
That's great.
You're really taking
to this dance.

981
00:52:33,110 --> 00:52:34,680
Well, it's a fun part.

982
00:52:34,710 --> 00:52:36,350
Well, you're
perfect for it.

983
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:38,920
Um, I could help you
carry all this

984
00:52:38,950 --> 00:52:40,820
back to your room
and put it away.

985
00:52:40,850 --> 00:52:42,450
Ah, that would be
great, Alice.

986
00:52:42,490 --> 00:52:44,860
Thanks so much
for offering.

987
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:48,330
Miss Cole?

988
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:50,630
I'll bet you like
musicals, don't you?

989
00:52:50,660 --> 00:52:52,000
Of course I do.

990
00:52:52,030 --> 00:52:54,270
That's why I like trying
to find new and unusual ones

991
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:55,600
for you kids to perform.

992
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:57,570
Well, did you know
my dad owns a music
store?

993
00:52:57,600 --> 00:52:59,270
Oh.

994
00:52:59,310 --> 00:53:01,670
And he carries
all types of sheet music
for all types of musicals.

995
00:53:01,710 --> 00:53:03,840
Oh, I'll have
to stop by sometime.

996
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:05,640
Great. Well, here's
the address,

997
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:07,610
and I usually help
him on Saturdays.

998
00:53:07,650 --> 00:53:09,710
Maybe I'll stop by
this weekend.

999
00:53:11,180 --> 00:53:13,750
Sometimes I'm so brilliant
it's scary.

1000
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:19,290
I can help too,
Miss Cole.

1001
00:53:19,330 --> 00:53:21,560
Wow, I have my choice
of helpers today.

1002
00:53:21,590 --> 00:53:22,530
Thank you, Pamela.

1003
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,960
You don't have
to stay, Pamela.

1004
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,230
I'm sure you're
really busy with all
the extra rehearsals.

1005
00:53:28,270 --> 00:53:31,800
Oh, it's not a problem.
I like helping Miss Cole.

1006
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:48,350
Thanks so much
for your help, girls.

1007
00:53:48,390 --> 00:53:51,290
I could help wash
the boards, if you want.

1008
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:54,390
Hmm. Well, I suppose they
could use a washing.

1009
00:53:54,430 --> 00:53:56,090
I'll take you up
on your offer, Alice.

1010
00:53:58,660 --> 00:54:00,830
The supply shelves are
looking a little messy.

1011
00:54:00,870 --> 00:54:01,900
I could straighten them out.

1012
00:54:03,570 --> 00:54:05,200
Well, if you really
want to, Pamela,

1013
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:06,540
but it's not necessary.

1014
00:54:06,570 --> 00:54:08,540
You've already done
enough already.

1015
00:54:08,570 --> 00:54:11,610
It's okay.
I'd love to help.

1016
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:13,540
I bet you do.

1017
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:19,450
I'm so glad Pamela
offered to help
this afternoon.

1018
00:54:19,490 --> 00:54:20,780
Now I have time

1019
00:54:20,820 --> 00:54:23,550
to go shopping
with you, Alice.

1020
00:54:23,590 --> 00:54:27,730
I'll just text the girls
to meet us at the mall.

Really, girls,
if you just want
to head home.

1027
00:55:23,150 --> 00:55:25,950
We're very enthusiastic
about our cleaning.

1028
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:27,850
Oh.

1029
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:40,160
Al, what are you
still doing here?

1030
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:42,170
I told you
you could go home
about an hour ago.

1031
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:44,800
The music was out of order,
so I'm just alphabetizing it.

1032
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:46,940
Oh. Well,
you'd better
get going soon.

1033
00:55:46,970 --> 00:55:48,140
It's getting dark
out there.

1034
00:55:48,170 --> 00:55:49,940
Well, I thought
I'd wait for you.

1035
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:52,940
No, honey, I have plans
tonight, remember?
We talked about it.

1036
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:54,810
With Kelly?

1037
00:55:54,850 --> 00:55:57,510
Yeah, we, uh...
we kind of have a date.

1038
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:02,150
You don't...love her,
do you, Dad?

1039
00:56:02,190 --> 00:56:05,060
[door bell chimes]
You know, it's, um...

1040
00:56:05,090 --> 00:56:06,690
It's not like
in the movies, Al.

1041
00:56:06,730 --> 00:56:09,090
You don't fall in love
with somebody overnight.

1042
00:56:09,130 --> 00:56:12,700
It usually takes
a while.

1043
00:56:12,730 --> 00:56:15,870
If my dating is a problem
for you, though, we can
talk about it.

1044
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:18,940
No, I want you
to date again.
I just want you

1045
00:56:18,970 --> 00:56:21,340
to find the right woman,
that's all.

1046
00:56:21,370 --> 00:56:23,940
So do I.
Miss Cole!

1047
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:25,340
Miss Cole!

1048
00:56:25,380 --> 00:56:26,380
Alice!
Yes!

1049
00:56:26,410 --> 00:56:28,010
Well, I made it.

1050
00:56:28,050 --> 00:56:29,110
Yes, yes.

1051
00:56:29,150 --> 00:56:31,050
Miss Cole, this is
Ben, my dad.

1052
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:32,250
Hi.

1053
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:34,550
He owns this whole
music store.

1054
00:56:34,590 --> 00:56:37,220
He's actually into
all types of music.
He was in a band once.

1055
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:39,690
He was the hottest guy.
He's actually dating
again too.

1056
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:41,860
It's been 6 years since
my mom passed away,

1057
00:56:41,890 --> 00:56:43,930
so you don't have to
worry about that either.
Alice?

1058
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:45,930
I think that's a little
more information

1059
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:48,030
than Miss Cole
was looking for.

1060
00:56:48,070 --> 00:56:50,930
Miss Cole is interested
in everybody.

1061
00:56:50,970 --> 00:56:53,040
She's very social.
Right, Miss Cole?

1062
00:56:53,070 --> 00:56:55,010
I guess.

1063
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:57,810
So, was there anything
in particular

1064
00:56:57,840 --> 00:56:59,780
that you were looking for?

1065
00:56:59,810 --> 00:57:03,310
No, I just thought
I'd browse through
your sheet music.

1066
00:57:03,350 --> 00:57:05,880
Great. If you
need anything,
just let me know.

1067
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:07,890
In the meantime,
I'd like a word
with Alice.

1068
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:12,090
Of course.
I should be getting
home soon anyway.

1069
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:28,000
I know you mean well, Alice,
and you're trying to help,

1070
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:30,370
but I think it's best
if I pick my own dates.

1071
00:57:30,410 --> 00:57:32,740
Dad, she's perfect.
She likes music,

1072
00:57:32,780 --> 00:57:34,750
she's smart,
she's beautiful.

1073
00:57:34,780 --> 00:57:36,950
She's 15 years
younger than me.

1074
00:57:36,980 --> 00:57:39,580
Age is just a state
of mind, Dad.

1075
00:57:39,620 --> 00:57:42,490
You're young at heart,
right? Can you please
just talk to her?

1076
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:45,560
I'm sure you'd like her
a lot more than Kelly.

1077
00:57:45,590 --> 00:57:47,090
She's hot.

1078
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:49,930
Al, I am not going out
with Miss Cole.

1079
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:52,930
[knock at door]
[Kelly]
Ben?

1080
00:57:52,970 --> 00:57:54,800
Hi.
Hi.

1081
00:57:56,130 --> 00:57:58,400
Am I interrupting?
Uh, no.

1082
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:00,600
No, I think, um,

1083
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:02,540
we're good here.

1084
00:58:08,850 --> 00:58:12,480
If he thinks I'm just
giving up like that,
he's crazy.

1085
00:58:13,820 --> 00:58:15,720
Thanks for the ride.

1086
00:58:15,750 --> 00:58:17,790
The mechanic said
my car would be
fixed yesterday,

1087
00:58:17,820 --> 00:58:19,990
so it'll probably be
sometime next week.

1088
00:58:20,030 --> 00:58:21,960
[chuckles]
My pleasure.

1089
00:58:23,630 --> 00:58:26,560
Besides, I had to
find some way

1090
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:29,070
to thank you for
that great dinner.

1091
00:58:41,050 --> 00:58:44,250
That feels...very good.

1092
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:47,420
I can't.

1093
00:58:47,450 --> 00:58:49,220
What's wrong?

1094
00:58:49,250 --> 00:58:51,290
[Ben]
I...I like you.

1095
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:54,690
I mean, I really do.
It's just, um...

1096
00:58:54,730 --> 00:58:58,700
my life's kind of
complicated right now.

1097
00:58:58,730 --> 00:59:03,300
Ben, Marie has been
gone for 6 years.

1098
00:59:03,340 --> 00:59:05,440
I know.

1099
00:59:05,470 --> 00:59:08,610
It's time to move on.
It's just, uh,

1100
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:10,870
I just moved here

1101
00:59:10,910 --> 00:59:13,180
and I bought
this store,

1102
00:59:13,210 --> 00:59:16,710
and my kids,
especially Alice,

1103
00:59:16,750 --> 00:59:18,850
she has a lot
going on right now.

1104
00:59:20,220 --> 00:59:23,590
What about yourself?
I'm not sure.

1105
00:59:23,620 --> 00:59:25,660
I'm not trying to rush
you into anything.

1106
00:59:25,690 --> 00:59:29,990
No, you're great.
It's just, um,

1107
00:59:30,030 --> 00:59:32,660
like I said,
it's complicated.

1108
00:59:32,700 --> 00:59:35,270
I'm not giving up on you.

1109
00:59:35,300 --> 00:59:37,500
Just know that.

1110
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:00,590
Dad, what's with
the dead bird?

1111
01:00:00,630 --> 01:00:02,290
It's Thanksgiving.

1112
01:00:02,330 --> 01:00:04,630
Again I ask, what's
with the dead bird?
We always go out.

1113
01:00:04,660 --> 01:00:06,830
Oh, no. Not this year.
Not with Sally
and Milt coming.

1114
01:00:06,870 --> 01:00:08,970
No, we're gonna
have a traditional
Thanksgiving dinner

1115
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,200
with a traditional
Thanksgiving turkey.

1116
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:13,100
And traditional
food poisoning?

1117
01:00:13,140 --> 01:00:14,810
Elizabeth told me

1118
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:17,640
if the turkey's
not properly cooked,
the bacteria could kill us.

1119
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:20,910
Hear that, Dad?
I'm too young to die.
Me too.

1120
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:23,110
Okay, if you're not gonna
help me cook,

1121
01:00:23,150 --> 01:00:24,750
then you go upstairs
and clean it up.

1122
01:00:24,780 --> 01:00:27,180
I need it in decent shape
by the time they get here.

1123
01:00:27,220 --> 01:00:29,890
Smiley girl, you go
do the laundry.

1124
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:31,960
Yes, you.

1125
01:00:39,260 --> 01:00:41,600
Okay, it's just
me and you now.

1126
01:00:47,010 --> 01:00:48,870
[groans]

1127
01:00:53,610 --> 01:00:55,910
[groans]

1128
01:01:03,720 --> 01:01:07,120
Hello. Ooh!

1129
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:13,000
[disposal whirrs]

1130
01:01:13,030 --> 01:01:14,900
Ugh!

1131
01:01:21,110 --> 01:01:23,040
[retches]

1132
01:01:26,340 --> 01:01:29,050
[grunting]

1133
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:51,970
Ow!

1134
01:01:53,940 --> 01:01:54,870
Ah! Hot!

1135
01:01:59,410 --> 01:02:03,110
[clattering]
No. No, no.

1136
01:02:25,370 --> 01:02:27,770
[footsteps approaching]

1137
01:02:29,170 --> 01:02:30,340
Laundry's done.

1138
01:02:30,380 --> 01:02:31,810
Need anything else?

1139
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:33,880
Uh, yeah.

1140
01:02:33,910 --> 01:02:36,110
You know that big
serving platter
that we have?

1141
01:02:36,150 --> 01:02:37,810
I think it's probably
in one of those boxes

1142
01:02:37,850 --> 01:02:39,420
we haven't unpacked
downstairs.

1143
01:02:42,890 --> 01:02:44,860
You've got to be
kidding me.

1144
01:02:51,030 --> 01:02:52,560
Ah, there you are.

1145
01:03:10,080 --> 01:03:12,720
[Ben]
Alice! Did you
find the platter?

1146
01:03:12,750 --> 01:03:14,080
Uh, I got it!

1147
01:03:17,390 --> 01:03:19,220
My teacher just
gave me an "A"

1148
01:03:19,260 --> 01:03:21,260
for the last English
report I did.

1149
01:03:21,290 --> 01:03:23,830
She said I had
a talent for writing.

1150
01:03:23,860 --> 01:03:25,230
I'm also in
the school musical.

1151
01:03:25,260 --> 01:03:26,230
It's a small part,

1152
01:03:26,270 --> 01:03:27,530
but I have
my own dance number,

1153
01:03:27,570 --> 01:03:28,900
so it's really important
to the story.

1154
01:03:28,930 --> 01:03:31,530
Oh, honey,
that is very good!

1155
01:03:31,570 --> 01:03:34,570
Alice, put your napkin
on your lap, hon.

1156
01:03:36,180 --> 01:03:38,110
Ben, put your napkin
on your lap.

1157
01:03:38,140 --> 01:03:40,680
Lester,
you too, hon.

1158
01:03:40,710 --> 01:03:43,480
And what about you, honey?
How are your grades?

1159
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:46,280
Pretty good.
I'm only failing
3 of my classes.

1160
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:50,290
Lester, stop it.
He's doing fine, Sally.

1161
01:03:50,320 --> 01:03:51,920
Well, I hope so.

1162
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:55,360
Junior year is
the most important
one for colleges.

1163
01:03:55,390 --> 01:03:56,730
I'm not going to college.

1164
01:03:56,760 --> 01:03:58,960
I'm going on tour
with my band.

1165
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,630
Or joining
the Merchant Marines.

1166
01:04:01,670 --> 01:04:02,730
What did I say?

1167
01:04:02,770 --> 01:04:04,400
She knows I'm kidding.

1168
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:06,840
Don't you,
Aunt Sally?

1169
01:04:06,870 --> 01:04:09,440
Well, of course I do.

1170
01:04:09,470 --> 01:04:12,610
But you are going
to college, aren't you?

1171
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:14,040
It's his decision,
not ours.

1172
01:04:14,080 --> 01:04:17,010
But do you think
that's wise?

1173
01:04:17,050 --> 01:04:20,080
I think that, uh,

1174
01:04:20,120 --> 01:04:22,790
everyone should get
to decide for himself

1175
01:04:22,820 --> 01:04:24,590
or herself what
their future should be.

1176
01:04:24,620 --> 01:04:26,990
But he hasn't even
turned 18 yet.

1177
01:04:28,690 --> 01:04:31,360
I don't think
Marie would want that.
I think I know

1178
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:34,360
better than you
what Marie would want;
I am his father.

1179
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:37,400
And if you can't respect
that, I don't think I can
welcome you in this house.

1180
01:04:44,340 --> 01:04:47,680
Well...I do know that.

1181
01:04:47,710 --> 01:04:49,780
And I respect that, Ben.

1182
01:04:49,810 --> 01:04:52,720
And...I'm sorry.

1183
01:04:52,750 --> 01:04:55,220
I worry about
them sometimes,

1184
01:04:55,250 --> 01:04:57,150
but just because
I love them so much.

1185
01:05:03,530 --> 01:05:06,560
I know.
Um, I'm sorry

1186
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:08,300
I raised my voice, Sally.

1187
01:05:08,330 --> 01:05:10,900
It's just, we've
been under a lot
of pressure lately,

1188
01:05:10,940 --> 01:05:14,240
and, um, I know
how much you love them,

1189
01:05:14,270 --> 01:05:17,570
and I can use all
the help I can get.

1190
01:05:17,610 --> 01:05:19,740
Well, thank you.

1191
01:05:22,280 --> 01:05:24,380
So what do you say
we talk about
something else?

1192
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:26,380
Milton,
how you been?
Great.

1193
01:05:26,420 --> 01:05:29,690
My Merchant Marine
application came through
without a hitch.

1194
01:05:29,720 --> 01:05:31,150
What?

1195
01:05:40,570 --> 01:05:42,930
[giggling]
I got the tickets!

1196
01:05:42,970 --> 01:05:45,870
[Ben]
Marie, move closer
to the play poster.

1197
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:47,140
I want to make sure
we remember

1198
01:05:47,170 --> 01:05:48,940
what we were seeing
when we're 90.

1199
01:05:48,970 --> 01:05:50,370
I think we'll be
lucky enough

1200
01:05:50,410 --> 01:05:51,770
to remember
each other's names,

1201
01:05:51,810 --> 01:05:54,780
forget about a musical
we saw 70 years ago.

1202
01:05:54,810 --> 01:05:58,420
Just think-- Someday
it could be you
starring in this.

1203
01:05:58,450 --> 01:06:00,350
Come on,
sing something.

1204
01:06:00,390 --> 01:06:02,790
Well, this your dream--
singing on Broadway.

1205
01:06:02,820 --> 01:06:06,120
I meant in a theatre,
not on a street corner.

01:16:14,670 --> 01:16:16,970
I owe you an apology.

1376
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,870
I overreacted last night
and jumped to conclusions.

1377
01:16:19,900 --> 01:16:21,900
I'm sorry.

1378
01:16:21,940 --> 01:16:24,370
I hope you'll stay
for the party.

1379
01:16:24,410 --> 01:16:27,110
And then afterwards
maybe you can help me
clean up a bit?

1380
01:16:27,140 --> 01:16:29,240
I'll give you a ride home
if it's too late to walk.

1381
01:16:30,820 --> 01:16:32,350
I'd love to stay
and help,

1382
01:16:32,380 --> 01:16:34,450
but I actually have
to go meet someone.

1383
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:48,100
Isn't it funny how
I've been trying to be
friends with Miss Cole

1384
01:16:48,130 --> 01:16:50,130
just so she could
be my role model

1385
01:16:50,170 --> 01:16:53,200
when my real role model was
standing right before me?

1386
01:16:57,140 --> 01:17:00,110
Hi, Mrs. Plotkin.
Oh, hi, Alice.

1387
01:17:00,140 --> 01:17:03,710
Theatre club was having
a party, so I thought
I'd bring you some cake.

1388
01:17:03,750 --> 01:17:06,080
That is so sweet
of you.

1389
01:17:06,120 --> 01:17:08,050
You know,

1390
01:17:08,090 --> 01:17:11,620
I was just thinking about
taking a little break myself.

1391
01:17:13,630 --> 01:17:15,120
Have a seat.

1392
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:17,630
I just want to thank you

1393
01:17:17,660 --> 01:17:18,790
for helping me
the other night.

1394
01:17:18,830 --> 01:17:20,130
It really made me
feel better.

1395
01:17:20,160 --> 01:17:22,130
Oh, it's my pleasure.

1396
01:17:22,170 --> 01:17:24,130
I was wondering if
I could come back

1397
01:17:24,170 --> 01:17:26,240
and help you
clean the room
in the afternoons.

1398
01:17:26,270 --> 01:17:28,300
Oh, that isn't
necessary, hon.

1399
01:17:28,340 --> 01:17:30,170
No, I'd like to, really.

1400
01:17:31,610 --> 01:17:33,980
I'm trying to say
it won't be necessary

1401
01:17:34,010 --> 01:17:35,880
because...

1402
01:17:35,910 --> 01:17:38,550
I'm not returning to school
after winter break.

1403
01:17:40,150 --> 01:17:41,850
Well, when are
you coming back?

1404
01:17:43,190 --> 01:17:45,660
September,
at the earliest.

1405
01:17:45,690 --> 01:17:48,960
I've decided to take
a sabbatical.

1406
01:17:48,990 --> 01:17:51,290
You know I've
been working here
over 25 years?

1407
01:17:52,860 --> 01:17:56,330
I decided I'd like to spend
a little more time at home.

1408
01:17:56,370 --> 01:17:58,400
You can't just leave
in the middle of the year.

1409
01:17:58,440 --> 01:18:01,400
Well, I know it's not
great timing, Alice,

1410
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:03,610
but that's the way things
work out sometimes.

1411
01:18:03,640 --> 01:18:05,680
But I have been
thinking that

1412
01:18:05,710 --> 01:18:09,150
if you would still like
to be in Miss Cole's class,

1413
01:18:09,180 --> 01:18:12,650
that I could maybe
get Mr. Edgecombe

1414
01:18:12,680 --> 01:18:15,690
to agree to transfer
you there.

1415
01:18:15,720 --> 01:18:18,620
Due to the circumstances
and all.

1416
01:18:18,660 --> 01:18:20,590
I don't want
to be transferred,

1417
01:18:20,620 --> 01:18:22,460
and I think what
you're doing is awful!

1418
01:18:22,490 --> 01:18:25,960
Alice...
Alice, come back!

1419
01:18:28,070 --> 01:18:30,800
Alice, stop.
Please?

1420
01:18:30,840 --> 01:18:34,000
I know you're upset,
and I understand that.

1421
01:18:34,040 --> 01:18:35,370
But please let me explain

1422
01:18:35,410 --> 01:18:37,870
the real reason why
I'm leaving, okay?

1423
01:18:37,910 --> 01:18:39,980
You're not going
on sabbatical?

1424
01:18:40,010 --> 01:18:42,180
Well, yes, I am,

1425
01:18:42,210 --> 01:18:45,080
but not because
I want to.

1426
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:47,750
My doctor
has recommended it.

1427
01:18:47,790 --> 01:18:50,190
Your doctor?

1428
01:18:50,220 --> 01:18:52,090
You see, Alice,

1429
01:18:52,120 --> 01:18:54,560
I have a problem
with my heart.

1430
01:18:54,590 --> 01:18:57,460
One of my valves
isn't right.

1431
01:18:57,490 --> 01:19:00,830
So they have to do
an operation to fix it.

1432
01:19:00,870 --> 01:19:03,370
Are you gonna be
all right?

1433
01:19:03,400 --> 01:19:06,640
Well, I certainly
hope so.

1434
01:19:06,670 --> 01:19:09,340
I mean, they'll do
the surgery and treatment

1435
01:19:09,370 --> 01:19:11,310
and all sorts of therapy

1436
01:19:11,340 --> 01:19:13,180
that'll make me
weak and tired,

1437
01:19:13,210 --> 01:19:14,580
but in a few months,

1438
01:19:14,610 --> 01:19:17,110
the doctor says
I should be fine.

1439
01:19:17,150 --> 01:19:18,750
I'm really sorry.

1440
01:19:18,780 --> 01:19:20,280
Me too.

1441
01:19:22,190 --> 01:19:23,490
But thank you.

1442
01:19:34,330 --> 01:19:36,270
[knocking]
Al?

1443
01:19:37,670 --> 01:19:39,640
Go away.

1444
01:19:42,110 --> 01:19:44,040
Mrs. Plotkin called.

1445
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:47,140
She's worried
about you.

1446
01:19:47,180 --> 01:19:50,610
She told me
what happened.
I'm sorry.

1447
01:19:50,650 --> 01:19:52,750
Well, I'm not.

1448
01:19:52,780 --> 01:19:54,780
Not anymore.

1449
01:19:54,820 --> 01:19:56,290
Don't say that.

1450
01:19:56,320 --> 01:19:58,690
Why not?

1451
01:19:58,720 --> 01:20:02,090
I may not see her again.
Why should I care?

1452
01:20:02,130 --> 01:20:04,230
You don't mean that.

1453
01:20:04,260 --> 01:20:06,800
Once someone's gone,
they're gone.

1454
01:20:06,830 --> 01:20:09,100
What good does it do
to think about them?

1455
01:20:09,130 --> 01:20:12,230
It doesn't make them any better.
It only makes you feel sad.

1456
01:20:12,270 --> 01:20:14,200
Alice, stop.

1457
01:20:14,240 --> 01:20:16,940
Isn't that why
you never want to watch
the videotapes of Mom?

1458
01:20:16,970 --> 01:20:19,040
Isn't that why you want
to date Kelly?

1459
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:21,280
'Cause you never want
to think about Mom!

1460
01:20:21,310 --> 01:20:25,050
I think about your mother
every moment of my life.

1461
01:20:25,080 --> 01:20:27,020
Alice...

1462
01:20:28,590 --> 01:20:30,920
there isn't an hour
that goes by

1463
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:32,290
that I don't wonder,

1464
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:34,960
"What would she do?
What would she think?"

1465
01:20:36,830 --> 01:20:40,660
I love her more than
anything in the world,

1466
01:20:40,700 --> 01:20:43,500
except maybe
you and Lester.

1467
01:20:43,530 --> 01:20:46,070
How come we never
talk about her?

1468
01:20:46,100 --> 01:20:48,140
How come I haven't
seen the tapes?

1469
01:20:49,670 --> 01:20:52,710
It was wrong of me to keep
that stuff from you guys.

1470
01:20:52,740 --> 01:20:55,680
I just...
I wanted us

1471
01:20:55,710 --> 01:20:59,880
to grow as a family,
not be stuck in the past.

1472
01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:01,880
I think about her

1473
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:04,220
all the time,

1474
01:21:04,260 --> 01:21:07,020
even though I can't
remember her.

1475
01:21:07,060 --> 01:21:10,990
I know you do.
You probably will
your whole life.

1476
01:21:11,030 --> 01:21:13,000
I know I will.

1477
01:21:14,670 --> 01:21:18,030
Just because
she isn't here,

1478
01:21:18,070 --> 01:21:19,700
it doesn't mean that
she's not with us.

1479
01:21:19,740 --> 01:21:22,500
She is with us.

1480
01:21:22,540 --> 01:21:24,740
That's what makes
us strong.

1481
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:29,210
What about
Mrs. Plotkin?

1482
01:21:29,250 --> 01:21:32,110
The thing about Mrs. Plotkin--

1483
01:21:32,150 --> 01:21:34,480
she's still alive.

1484
01:21:34,520 --> 01:21:36,290
And, yeah, she's gonna
be gone for a while,

1485
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:37,620
but she'll come back.

1486
01:21:37,650 --> 01:21:41,420
When she does,
you can call her,

1487
01:21:41,460 --> 01:21:43,390
write her nice letters--

1488
01:21:43,430 --> 01:21:44,790
I know she'd like that.

1489
01:21:47,130 --> 01:21:48,400
I think I'll do that.

1490
01:21:50,130 --> 01:21:53,040
Dad, I love you.

1491
01:21:53,070 --> 01:21:55,270
I love you too.

1492
01:22:01,550 --> 01:22:04,950
And I think
Kelly's pretty cool.

1493
01:22:04,980 --> 01:22:08,580
It'd be okay with me if
you wanted to see her again.

1494
01:22:10,220 --> 01:22:12,850
As much as
I like Kelly,

1495
01:22:12,890 --> 01:22:16,560
I feel like I got a lot
on my plate right now.

1496
01:22:16,590 --> 01:22:19,160

coming back?
Absolutely.

surgery went well,

that in maybe...
