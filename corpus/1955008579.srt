<i>For the last 12 years,</i>

3
00:00:48,963 --> 00:00:51,766
<i>Biblical archaeologist Don Verdean</i>

4
00:00:51,767 --> 00:00:53,667
<i>has received worldwide acclaim</i>

5
00:00:53,668 --> 00:00:56,504
<i>for his incredible
discoveries in the Holy Land.</i>

6
00:00:56,505 --> 00:00:59,507
<i>Don's discoveries
have touched the lives</i>

7
00:00:59,508 --> 00:01:01,041
<i>of countless millions,</i>

8
00:01:01,042 --> 00:01:03,977
<i>confirming their faith and
the miraculous narratives</i>

9
00:01:03,978 --> 00:01:06,613
<i>found in the Bible.</i>

10
00:01:06,614 --> 00:01:08,548
<i>On his latest trip
to the Middle East,</i>

11
00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:12,652
<i>Don contacted Adabi
Hassan from Saudi Arabia,</i>

12
00:01:12,653 --> 00:01:15,056
<i>who agreed to accompany
Don to a location</i>

13
00:01:15,057 --> 00:01:18,926
<i>rumored to be the burial site
of Samson from the Bible.</i>

14
00:01:18,927 --> 00:01:21,396
<i>But, sadly, upon their arrival,</i>

15
00:01:21,397 --> 00:01:24,831
<i>all that remained of the
site was a large, empty hole</i>

16
00:01:24,832 --> 00:01:27,535
<i>caused by looting
the previous month.</i>

17
00:01:27,536 --> 00:01:29,170
<i>Don was devastated.</i>

18
00:01:29,171 --> 00:01:31,973
<i>Adabi then informed him
of a lesser known location</i>

19
00:01:31,974 --> 00:01:33,708
<i>in the valley of Sorek.</i>

20
00:01:33,709 --> 00:01:36,176
<i>After months of intense excavation,</i>

21
00:01:36,177 --> 00:01:38,845
<i>Don made the discovery
of a lifetime...</i>

22
00:01:38,846 --> 00:01:43,684
<i>iron shears dating
back over 3,000 years.</i>

23
00:01:43,685 --> 00:01:45,652
<i>Could these be the very blades</i>

24
00:01:45,653 --> 00:01:48,089
<i>used to strip Samson
of his strength?</i>

25
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:50,090
<i>Don decided to share his findings</i>

26
00:01:50,091 --> 00:01:52,893
<i>with Dr. Stelios Patrokolis,</i>

27
00:01:52,894 --> 00:01:56,563
<i>world-renowned for his excavations
of the Byzantine Empire.</i>

28
00:01:56,564 --> 00:01:59,934
<i>After reviewing the forensic data,</i>

29
00:01:59,935 --> 00:02:03,806
<i>Dr. Patrokolis made the
following statement:</i>

30
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:18,085
I'll bet.

31
00:02:18,086 --> 00:02:21,155
<i>After this brief interview
with Dr. Patrokolis,</i>

32
00:02:21,156 --> 00:02:24,192
<i>Don's discovery was made public.</i>

33
00:02:24,193 --> 00:02:28,196
<i>He now travels the world
sharing his message of faith</i>

34
00:02:28,197 --> 00:02:31,300
<i>to a whole new
generation of believers.</i>

35
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,602
<i>The tireless efforts of Don Verdean</i>

36
00:02:34,603 --> 00:02:37,906
<i>will continue to bless
millions everywhere.</i>

37
00:02:45,681 --> 00:02:47,349
Next question.

38
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:50,585
Yeah?

39
00:02:50,586 --> 00:02:53,621
Mr. Verdean, there's a... a, uh, letter.

40
00:02:53,622 --> 00:02:55,889
Well, it's an online document

41
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:57,892
that's received wide distribution

42
00:02:57,893 --> 00:03:00,627
throughout the ministry, as
I'm... I'm sure you've seen it.

43
00:03:00,628 --> 00:03:02,930
It's, for the record, from the, uh,

44
00:03:02,931 --> 00:03:04,931
Israeli Antiquities Authority.

45
00:03:04,932 --> 00:03:07,535
I'd like to share that,
if that's all right.

46
00:03:07,536 --> 00:03:10,071
<i>Yes, go right ahead.</i>

47
00:03:10,072 --> 00:03:13,007
"Thank you for your inquiry dated July 13th

48
00:03:13,008 --> 00:03:15,876
asking about Don Verdean.

49
00:03:15,877 --> 00:03:18,044
We cannot confirm his finds

50
00:03:18,045 --> 00:03:20,948
and have no information
about them whatsoever.

51
00:03:20,949 --> 00:03:22,949
<i>If he says he has
excavated in Israel,</i>

52
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:25,786
<i>he has committed an illegal act.</i>

53
00:03:25,787 --> 00:03:27,121
<i>We have never heard of this man,</i>

54
00:03:27,122 --> 00:03:29,257
<i>nor have we had any
dealings with him.</i>

55
00:03:29,258 --> 00:03:31,893
Legitimate archaeology finds

56
00:03:31,894 --> 00:03:34,662
are published in professional journals

57
00:03:34,663 --> 00:03:39,032
or by universities and
other scientific institutes.

58
00:03:39,033 --> 00:03:41,936
Sincerely yours, Nahum Ishalom,

59
00:03:41,937 --> 00:03:44,874
spokesman for Israeli Antiquities."

60
00:03:46,307 --> 00:03:48,810
<i>Thank you. Thank you
for reading that.</i>

61
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,549
Now, uh,

62
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:58,251
Satan takes advantage
of situations like this.

63
00:03:58,252 --> 00:04:00,621
There's two things happening here.

64
00:04:00,622 --> 00:04:04,257
One, the Israelis don't
want this discovery confirmed

65
00:04:04,258 --> 00:04:06,126
until, you know,

66
00:04:06,127 --> 00:04:09,563
it can be done in a manner
that won't cause a bloodbath.

67
00:04:09,564 --> 00:04:12,866
Two, all of my excavating was done

68
00:04:12,867 --> 00:04:15,703
in a very public place,

69
00:04:15,704 --> 00:04:18,004
and had I done it without a permit,

70
00:04:18,005 --> 00:04:21,842
I can assure you I would've
been thrown in prison.

71
00:04:21,843 --> 00:04:26,713
<i>Unfortunately, this is how
the Israelis handle things.</i>

72
00:04:26,714 --> 00:04:28,950
If you ask any of them

73
00:04:28,951 --> 00:04:32,855
if they know Don Verdean,
they'll say they don't.

74
00:04:34,221 --> 00:04:35,989
Carol, did you, uh...

75
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:37,624
bring that book with you?

76
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:40,361
The one with my ugly face on the front?

77
00:04:41,228 --> 00:04:43,064
Could you hand it to me?

78
00:04:43,865 --> 00:04:45,467
Thank you.

79
00:04:46,901 --> 00:04:50,236
Now...

80
00:04:50,237 --> 00:04:53,374
if you'll all be so kind
as to look right here.

81
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:57,111
In this picture, you will
see myself and another man.

82
00:04:57,112 --> 00:04:59,280
This gentleman standing next to me

83
00:04:59,281 --> 00:05:02,282
is none other than Nahum Ishalom,

84
00:05:02,283 --> 00:05:04,986
spokesman for the Israeli Antiquities

85
00:05:04,987 --> 00:05:08,858
and author of the letter
that was just read to you.

86
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:14,895
When asked if he knew
Don Verdean, he said "no."

87
00:05:14,896 --> 00:05:16,631
But if you look at this picture,

88
00:05:16,632 --> 00:05:18,900
you'll see that the
truth is something else.

89
00:05:26,641 --> 00:05:28,244
Thank you so much.

90
00:05:33,348 --> 00:05:37,186
- <i>♪ You may ask me how I know ♪</i>
- Don: <i>You bet. Let's take a picture.</i>

91
00:05:39,086 --> 00:05:41,422
<i>♪ My Lord is real... ♪</i>

92
00:05:41,423 --> 00:05:43,323
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

93
00:05:43,324 --> 00:05:45,893
<i>♪ My Lord is real... ♪</i>

94
00:05:45,894 --> 00:05:47,828
<i>Let me make one thing clear.</i>

95
00:05:47,829 --> 00:05:50,765
<i>These things are God's
things, not my things.</i>

96
00:05:50,766 --> 00:05:53,366
He is allowed me to find these treasures

97
00:05:53,367 --> 00:05:55,268
because I am simple man.

98
00:05:55,269 --> 00:05:57,237
<i>It's very obvious that
I have never found</i>

99
00:05:57,238 --> 00:06:00,207
anything based on my own intellect.

100
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:03,076
Nobody on Earth is...
is clever enough to...

101
00:06:03,077 --> 00:06:05,712
...find these things of their own volition.

102
00:06:05,713 --> 00:06:06,981
- <i>That's right.</i>
- You know.

103
00:06:06,982 --> 00:06:09,215
I work with Tony Lazarus,

104
00:06:09,216 --> 00:06:12,386
and we'd love to set up a meeting
with Mr. Verdean, if we could.

105
00:06:12,387 --> 00:06:16,790
<i>♪ I can feel His hand in mine ♪</i>

106
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:21,996
<i>♪ And that's enough for me. ♪</i>

107
00:06:23,798 --> 00:06:27,167
How'd we do tonight?

108
00:06:27,168 --> 00:06:29,770
Oh, everyone just loved
your presentation, Don,

109
00:06:29,771 --> 00:06:32,205
but we only sold about 10 copies.

110
00:06:32,206 --> 00:06:35,409
Well, long as kept a few
sheep from goin' astray,

111
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:37,744
can't ask for much more than that.

112
00:06:37,745 --> 00:06:40,181
What's the rest of our week lookin' like?

113
00:06:40,182 --> 00:06:42,215
Well, the Friday lecture group

114
00:06:42,216 --> 00:06:44,451
for the Bible study class just cancelled.

115
00:06:44,452 --> 00:06:48,054
Well, that's unfortunate.

116
00:06:48,055 --> 00:06:49,924
But I did get a request from a place called

117
00:06:49,925 --> 00:06:52,325
The Lazarus Fellowship Center.

118
00:06:52,326 --> 00:06:56,030
<i>Apparently, their pastor's just
dyin' to meet with you tomorrow.</i>

119
00:06:56,031 --> 00:06:59,799
Wait... wait a second, are
you talkin' about Tony Lazarus?

120
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,068
Yes. Should I know who that is?

121
00:07:02,069 --> 00:07:05,438
Well, Tony died in a
car accident 10 years ago

122
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:07,874
while drivin' to Wendover with a hooker.

123
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:10,010
<i>The spirit left his
body and everything,</i>

124
00:07:10,011 --> 00:07:12,179
but the good Lord decided
to give him a second chance

125
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:15,015
and send him back to Earth
as a modern day Lazarus.

126
00:07:15,016 --> 00:07:17,217
Incredible.

127
00:07:17,218 --> 00:07:18,818
Tony married the hooker and they started

128
00:07:18,819 --> 00:07:20,453
their own ministry together.

129
00:07:20,454 --> 00:07:22,123
Wow.

130
00:07:22,124 --> 00:07:24,891
Tony Lazarus.

131
00:07:24,892 --> 00:07:26,426
What time's he want to see me tomorrow?

132
00:07:26,427 --> 00:07:28,962
First thing in the morning.

133
00:07:31,867 --> 00:07:34,169
<i>Praised be the Lord, there he is.</i>

134
00:07:35,937 --> 00:07:37,304
Whoo!

135
00:07:37,305 --> 00:07:40,907
Oh, well...

136
00:07:43,077 --> 00:07:44,477
It is such a pleasure to see you.

137
00:07:44,478 --> 00:07:46,981
And an absolute honor to finally meet ya.

138
00:07:46,982 --> 00:07:49,215
I've been followin' your work for
years. I feel like I already know ya.

139
00:07:49,216 --> 00:07:51,385
Well, it's a real pleasure to be here.

140
00:07:51,386 --> 00:07:53,453
I-I-I tell
you what, I...

141
00:07:53,454 --> 00:07:55,455
Well, this is my beautiful wife, Joylinda.

142
00:07:55,456 --> 00:07:58,058
- Oh.
- I've seen the pictures.

143
00:07:58,059 --> 00:08:00,027
Lovely to meet you.

144
00:08:00,028 --> 00:08:02,429
I bet these hands have touched all kinds

145
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:04,231
- of sacred relics.
- Yes, ma'am.

146
00:08:04,232 --> 00:08:06,066
Just a few.

147
00:08:06,067 --> 00:08:07,868
And who's your wonderful companion?

148
00:08:07,869 --> 00:08:09,335
Who? Oh, yes! I'm sorry.

149
00:08:09,336 --> 00:08:11,571
This is my car... uh,
secretary. Carol Jensen.

150
00:08:11,572 --> 00:08:13,506
- Carol? Oh, that's a lovely name.
- Yes.

151
00:08:13,507 --> 00:08:15,176
- Thank you.
- We're just so happy you two could be here.

152
00:08:15,177 --> 00:08:17,111
Please, please, y'all, come have a seat.

153
00:08:17,112 --> 00:08:19,179
We're so grateful you're
here. We have much to discuss.

154
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:21,849
- Come take a seat.
- Whoo!

155
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:23,984
I feel it!

156
00:08:23,985 --> 00:08:26,052
Well, Don, it should be no surprise to you

157
00:08:26,053 --> 00:08:27,587
that we are all big fans.

158
00:08:27,588 --> 00:08:29,289
I mean, perhaps your biggest fans.

159
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:31,458
We've seen all the DVDs,
read all your books.

160
00:08:31,459 --> 00:08:34,161
There is no one in the
world that does what you do.

161
00:08:34,162 --> 00:08:37,565
Well, thank you, Tony.
I've been very fortunate.

162
00:08:37,566 --> 00:08:39,499
<i>Well, God knows what He's doin'.</i>

163
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,569
Don, if you would bear with
me, I'm just gonna go ahead

164
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:43,838
and cut to the chase and tell
you why I brought you here.

165
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:47,173
<i>As I'm sure you're aware,
church attendance in America</i>

166
00:08:47,174 --> 00:08:49,909
has been on a massive
decline in recent years.

167
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:53,848
And I've felt the effects of that
right here in my very own congregation.

168
00:08:53,849 --> 00:08:56,149
Slowly but surely, this
nation is becommin' godless,

169
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:57,884
and it's frightening.

170
00:08:57,885 --> 00:08:59,552
<i>I mean, not to mention the
fact that there is a...</i>

171
00:08:59,553 --> 00:09:02,223
a new church that has sprung
up mere blocks from here.

172
00:09:02,224 --> 00:09:05,392
The pastor there has been
siphonin' my flock for months now.

173
00:09:05,393 --> 00:09:07,595
You know, he's a former
Satanist turned Christian.

174
00:09:07,596 --> 00:09:09,997
<i>Oh, people are really
taken by his story.</i>

175
00:09:09,998 --> 00:09:13,032
Oh, yes, but I fear he's
leadin' them down the wrong path.

176
00:09:13,033 --> 00:09:14,468
You see,

177
00:09:14,469 --> 00:09:17,037
he holds them with...
with a fear of the occult.

178
00:09:17,038 --> 00:09:18,205
That's how he keeps his numbers up,

179
00:09:18,206 --> 00:09:20,240
and that is not a good foundation.

180
00:09:20,241 --> 00:09:22,609
And right now, Don, people need
a good foundation more than ever.

181
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:24,311
You got that right.

182
00:09:24,312 --> 00:09:26,946
False prophets aside,
there are some evil factions

183
00:09:26,947 --> 00:09:28,648
"withinside" the scientific community

184
00:09:28,649 --> 00:09:31,284
that are dead-set upon
destroyin' the truth.

185
00:09:31,285 --> 00:09:33,454
You know, the other day I
was walkin' down the street

186
00:09:33,455 --> 00:09:35,422
and this man told me... he said,

187
00:09:35,423 --> 00:09:38,626
"Did you know that we have
evolved from protozoas?"

188
00:09:39,527 --> 00:09:41,095
Do you know what a protozoa is?

189
00:09:41,096 --> 00:09:42,528
No, I do not.

190
00:09:42,529 --> 00:09:44,931
It's a God dong sea monkey.

191
00:09:44,932 --> 00:09:47,567
- Say what?
- Can you imagine that?

192
00:09:47,568 --> 00:09:49,302
Lookin' around at the loved ones...

193
00:09:49,303 --> 00:09:52,038
at your mother, at your
father, at your beautiful wife,

194
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:53,974
and sayin', "You're a sea monkey.

195
00:09:53,975 --> 00:09:56,377
You belong on the bookshelf of a child

196
00:09:56,378 --> 00:09:58,112
<i>that's going to neglect you</i>

197
00:09:58,113 --> 00:10:00,446
and watch you swim around for a few days

198
00:10:00,447 --> 00:10:02,649
and then end up falling to the bottom

199
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:05,185
of the sea monkey aquarium
and turning into dust."

200
00:10:05,186 --> 00:10:07,186
Holy Ghost power. That's awful.

201
00:10:07,187 --> 00:10:09,989
Did you evolve from that, Don?

202
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:12,191
Now, you see, these
younger generations, Don,

203
00:10:12,192 --> 00:10:14,161
they need proof. Okay?

204
00:10:14,162 --> 00:10:16,596
They need hard evidence
in these dark, dark, times.

205
00:10:16,597 --> 00:10:19,599
And I believe that the
Lord has been preparing you.

206
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,936
<i>The Lord wants you to be His...</i>

207
00:10:21,937 --> 00:10:24,404
<i>His instrument in this great work.</i>

208
00:10:24,405 --> 00:10:26,473
Now, what I'm proposing, Don,

209
00:10:26,474 --> 00:10:28,474
is that you allow us

210
00:10:28,475 --> 00:10:31,277
to participate with you in this great work

211
00:10:31,278 --> 00:10:33,413
by letting us bankroll

212
00:10:33,414 --> 00:10:36,149
all your future digs and projects.

213
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,287
I honestly don't know what to say.

214
00:10:41,288 --> 00:10:43,356
Any artifact you would find, you would...

215
00:10:43,357 --> 00:10:45,960
you would bring it here and we'd
present it to our congregation.

216
00:10:45,961 --> 00:10:50,064
And we'd put it on display for
the whole world to see His truth.

217
00:10:50,065 --> 00:10:53,700
It'd be like a little museum of
sorts here at the Lazarus Fellowship.

218
00:10:53,701 --> 00:10:55,369
<i>It would be like a Holy Land</i>

219
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:57,403
<i>set in the good ol', U.S. of A.</i>

220
00:10:57,404 --> 00:11:01,376
Right here, where it
should be. Not over there.

221
00:11:03,345 --> 00:11:05,446
Well, Tony, I think it's very clear to me

222
00:11:05,447 --> 00:11:07,648
that the hand of... Providence

223
00:11:07,649 --> 00:11:10,584
has... brought us to this juncture.

224
00:11:10,585 --> 00:11:13,320
I-I think it's fair to say this
might be a match made in heaven.

225
00:11:13,321 --> 00:11:15,589
<i>Oh, I was hopin' you
were gonna say that.</i>

226
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:18,558
Don, we have been prayin'
so long and hard for this,

227
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:22,262
and we would love nothin' more than
to begin this adventure immediately.

228
00:11:22,263 --> 00:11:24,598
Well, today's your lucky day.

229
00:11:24,599 --> 00:11:26,532
I believe I have a solid lead

230
00:11:26,533 --> 00:11:28,435
on the location of Lot's wife.

231
00:11:28,436 --> 00:11:30,436
You gotta be kiddin' me.

232
00:11:37,278 --> 00:11:40,614
<i>Two weeks ago my sources
inside Israel sent me this.</i>

233
00:11:40,615 --> 00:11:43,017
Approximately three furlongs to the south

234
00:11:43,018 --> 00:11:45,687
of where I discovered the sulfuric
remains of Sodom and Gomorrah.

235
00:11:50,225 --> 00:11:52,292
This is incredible.

236
00:11:52,293 --> 00:11:55,028
Have the Israelis tested
this for salt content?

237
00:11:55,029 --> 00:11:57,697
The sample taken to the lab
indicated that this structure

238
00:11:57,698 --> 00:12:01,034
was made up of 97% sodium chloride.

239
00:12:01,035 --> 00:12:04,204
I was told that's the purest
salt they've ever tested.

240
00:12:07,241 --> 00:12:08,944
I don't know what to say.

241
00:12:10,577 --> 00:12:13,047
I mean, Don, you've
actually found Lot's wife.

242
00:12:15,783 --> 00:12:18,585
It's all right, sweetheart.

243
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:23,757
When can we bring her here?

244
00:12:31,765 --> 00:12:34,500
Hi, shalom, Boaz?

245
00:12:34,501 --> 00:12:36,670
It's Don Verdean.

246
00:12:36,671 --> 00:12:38,705
I can... I can barely hear you.

247
00:12:38,706 --> 00:12:41,407
Boaz, it's Don Verdean

248
00:12:41,408 --> 00:12:43,243
from America. How are ya?

249
00:12:43,244 --> 00:12:46,379
<i>Shem, sheket. Sheket!</i>

250
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:48,481
Shalom <i>from... can you hear me?</i>

251
00:12:48,482 --> 00:12:50,450
No, tell the camel, "Shut up."

252
00:12:50,451 --> 00:12:52,152
The camel keep talking.

253
00:12:52,153 --> 00:12:55,221
Boaz, it's Don Verdean from America.

254
00:12:55,222 --> 00:12:57,224
- How are ya?
- <i>Hello, Don.</i>

255
00:12:57,225 --> 00:12:59,460
Ah, yes, it's me, Boaz.

256
00:12:59,461 --> 00:13:01,427
Uh, what's up, man?

257
00:13:01,428 --> 00:13:04,364
Well, uh, good news. You
remember that pillar of salt

258
00:13:04,365 --> 00:13:06,566
you and your brother found out
in the desert two weeks ago?

259
00:13:06,567 --> 00:13:09,503
Well, I need you to ship it to me.

260
00:13:09,504 --> 00:13:11,638
I can wire you the money tonight.

261
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:14,740
- Oh, yeah, yeah, that thing.
- Yeah, about that.

262
00:13:14,741 --> 00:13:17,311
That's not there anymore.

263
00:13:17,312 --> 00:13:19,113
<i>Uh, I'm sorry, say that again?</i>

264
00:13:19,114 --> 00:13:20,880
I said, "That is not there anymore."

265
00:13:20,881 --> 00:13:23,182
What do you mean, "It's not there anymore"?

266
00:13:23,183 --> 00:13:25,819
- Where'd it go?
- <i>Me and Shem were out there today,</i>

267
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:28,254
and we're looking and we're looking,

268
00:13:28,255 --> 00:13:31,825
but, uh, we don't see her.

269
00:13:31,826 --> 00:13:34,795
Well, are you sure you're
looking in the right place?

270
00:13:34,796 --> 00:13:36,797
No?

271
00:13:36,798 --> 00:13:39,365
- <i>Uh, say what?</i>
- Uh, maybe.

272
00:13:39,366 --> 00:13:41,301
<i>Now come on, Boaz!</i>

273
00:13:41,302 --> 00:13:43,436
I mean, this could be
the find of the century.

274
00:13:43,437 --> 00:13:45,138
I mean, we're talkin'
about Lot's wife here.

275
00:13:45,139 --> 00:13:46,806
<i>There are a lot of
rocks out there, Don.</i>

276
00:13:46,807 --> 00:13:49,408
They all look the same. How
do I know which one is the one?

277
00:13:49,409 --> 00:13:51,545
Well, it can't be that hard.

278
00:13:51,546 --> 00:13:53,880
We need the one with breasts.

279
00:13:53,881 --> 00:13:57,551
Oh, the breasts. Okay, that one.

280
00:13:57,552 --> 00:14:01,555
- Oh, yeah.
- There's one big white rock,

281
00:14:01,556 --> 00:14:03,690
and it has breasts on it.

282
00:14:03,691 --> 00:14:06,325
All right. Chill out, <i>sababa.</i>

283
00:14:06,326 --> 00:14:08,295
- It's cool.
- <i>No, it's not cool!</i>

284
00:14:08,296 --> 00:14:11,431
Okay? Get the Marines, get the Taliban,

285
00:14:11,432 --> 00:14:14,468
get the Mormon Tabernacle
Choir, if you have to,

286
00:14:14,469 --> 00:14:16,603
but find the pillar of salt!

287
00:14:16,604 --> 00:14:18,538
Now, don't you be facetious, Don.

288
00:14:18,539 --> 00:14:20,407
<i>Don't screw this up, Boaz.</i>

289
00:14:20,408 --> 00:14:22,475
You get her on a plane tomorrow.

290
00:14:22,476 --> 00:14:26,446
There are countless souls whose
very salvation is at stake here.

291
00:14:26,447 --> 00:14:28,849
You do not want their blood on your hands.

292
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:31,450
- <i>Do you want to go to hell?</i>
- No.

293
00:14:31,451 --> 00:14:33,720
- <i>Do you believe in hell?</i>
- I'm not sure,

294
00:14:33,721 --> 00:14:35,721
but I don't take chances.

295
00:14:35,722 --> 00:14:37,724
<i>All right, well, I'll wire
you the money tonight.</i>

296
00:14:37,725 --> 00:14:39,692
- <i>Hey, Don?</i>
- What?

297
00:14:39,693 --> 00:14:41,928
<i>Catch you later, man.</i>

298
00:14:41,929 --> 00:14:44,630
All right, well, I'll catch you later, too.

299
00:14:44,631 --> 00:14:46,634
All right. Goodbye, now.

300
00:14:47,467 --> 00:14:50,204
Good Lord, have mercy.

301
00:15:06,421 --> 00:15:08,457
I brought you some supper.

302
00:15:09,657 --> 00:15:11,490
You didn't have to do that.

303
00:15:11,491 --> 00:15:15,295
It's just some pot stickers
and a raisin cookie.

304
00:15:15,296 --> 00:15:17,364
Well, I don't care much for raisins,

305
00:15:17,365 --> 00:15:19,932
<i>but thank you.</i>

306
00:15:19,933 --> 00:15:23,803
Carol, how long you
been workin' for me now?

307
00:15:23,804 --> 00:15:26,940
- Almost eight months.
- <i>Wow.</i>

308
00:15:26,941 --> 00:15:30,377
Time's really flown by.

309
00:15:30,378 --> 00:15:32,412
<i>Well, after what's transpired today,</i>

310
00:15:32,413 --> 00:15:35,415
<i>I need you to cancel
the rest of the tour.</i>

311
00:15:35,416 --> 00:15:37,017
But, more importantly, it doesn't look like

312
00:15:37,018 --> 00:15:39,987
I'm gonna need anyone to
manage my schedule anymore.

313
00:15:41,623 --> 00:15:43,990
Oh, uh, uh, okay.

314
00:15:43,991 --> 00:15:45,725
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- Well, um,

315
00:15:45,726 --> 00:15:47,994
I'm happy to stick around a few more days

316
00:15:47,995 --> 00:15:49,662
to help you transition.

317
00:15:49,663 --> 00:15:52,465
What? No. No, no, Carol,

318
00:15:52,466 --> 00:15:55,701
you're not getting fired.
I-I-I want to promote you

319
00:15:55,702 --> 00:15:58,839
<i>to research assistant
and field documentarian.</i>

320
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:01,742
Oh, Don, I would be honored!

321
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:06,580
Carol, I want to make one thing very clear.

322
00:16:06,581 --> 00:16:09,449
Finding treasure in
the Earth is meaningless

323
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:11,417
unless it will help someone get to heaven

324
00:16:11,418 --> 00:16:13,552
<i>that wouldn't get there otherwise.</i>

325
00:16:13,553 --> 00:16:16,290
That's what I admire about you, Don.

326
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:18,057
You're in this for all the right reasons.

327
00:16:19,961 --> 00:16:21,630
Well...

328
00:16:23,298 --> 00:16:25,300
- good night.
- <i>Night.</i>

329
00:16:28,669 --> 00:16:32,139
Ah!

330
00:17:07,541 --> 00:17:10,777
Well, there she is. Lot's wife.

331
00:17:10,778 --> 00:17:14,114
Don, don't get me wrong, I
mean, she obviously is beautiful,

332
00:17:14,115 --> 00:17:16,883
but, uh, is it just me, or does she look

333
00:17:16,884 --> 00:17:18,518
a little different than
she does in the, uh,

334
00:17:18,519 --> 00:17:20,554
photograph the Israelis sent you?

335
00:17:20,555 --> 00:17:24,091
<i>Well, Tony, I'm always amazed
at how certain artifacts</i>

336
00:17:24,092 --> 00:17:27,361
have the ability to
completely re-write history.

337
00:17:27,362 --> 00:17:29,762
<i>Based on the evidence
standing right here before us,</i>

338
00:17:29,763 --> 00:17:31,998
I think it's very plausible that

339
00:17:31,999 --> 00:17:34,069
Lot's wife was a hermaphrodite.

340
00:17:35,603 --> 00:17:37,537
<i>I'm sure it was quite
common in those days.</i>

341
00:17:37,538 --> 00:17:40,507
Limited gene pool,
incest, and what have you.

342
00:17:40,508 --> 00:17:42,675
That would probably explain why Lot's wife

343
00:17:42,676 --> 00:17:45,045
was so dead-set upon returning
to the Forbidden City.

344
00:17:45,046 --> 00:17:47,047
<i>Bingo.</i>

345
00:17:47,048 --> 00:17:48,781
My only fear is the, uh,

346
00:17:48,782 --> 00:17:51,050
milk drinkers of my congregation.

347
00:17:51,051 --> 00:17:54,254
Is this meat going to be
too much for them to swallow?

348
00:18:03,029 --> 00:18:06,700
- Hello?
- Boaz, what in the hell did you send me?!

349
00:18:06,701 --> 00:18:08,535
<i>What do you mean
what did we send you?</i>

350
00:18:08,536 --> 00:18:11,137
We sent you Lot's wife. The
one with the two breasts.

351
00:18:11,138 --> 00:18:12,905
Well, she also came

352
00:18:12,906 --> 00:18:16,410
with a veritable fruit salad in her pants!

353
00:18:16,411 --> 00:18:18,412
<i>Now, come on, Boaz!</i>

354
00:18:18,413 --> 00:18:21,581
I just can't tolerate this
type of sloppy archaeology.

355
00:18:21,582 --> 00:18:23,616
<i>Let me ask you this,</i>

356
00:18:23,617 --> 00:18:27,086
which one of you screwed
up my pillar of salt?!

357
00:18:27,087 --> 00:18:30,556
<i>Don, Don, this is the real
Lot's wife. I promise you.</i>

358
00:18:30,557 --> 00:18:32,959
She was smuggled straight
out of the Holy Land.

359
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,694
<i>I know it's different from
the picture we sent you,</i>

360
00:18:35,695 --> 00:18:38,698
<i>but this one matches the
description in the "Bibla."</i>

361
00:18:38,699 --> 00:18:40,800
- What did you say?
- <i>You have to believe me</i>

362
00:18:40,801 --> 00:18:42,635
<i>that this is really her, Don.</i>

363
00:18:42,636 --> 00:18:44,837
This is Lot's wife.

364
00:18:44,838 --> 00:18:48,107
<i>I'm telling you, Don.
I'd bet my life on it.</i>

365
00:18:48,108 --> 00:18:50,009

Wasn't that beautiful?

385
00:20:04,551 --> 00:20:07,121
Beautiful voice, beautiful message.

386
00:20:08,154 --> 00:20:10,524
Brothers and sisters, I am humbled

387
00:20:10,525 --> 00:20:12,959
by what I am going to share with you.

388
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,760
Just a few weeks ago,

389
00:20:14,761 --> 00:20:17,530
an incredible discovery
was found in Israel.

390
00:20:17,531 --> 00:20:20,100
<i>World renowned
archaeologist Don Verdean</i>

391
00:20:20,101 --> 00:20:22,536
<i>and his team of experts</i>

392
00:20:22,537 --> 00:20:24,738
have uncovered what many scholars believe

393
00:20:24,739 --> 00:20:27,073
to be the remains of Lot's wife,

394
00:20:27,074 --> 00:20:31,076
as found in Genesis 19, verse 26.

395
00:20:31,077 --> 00:20:34,213
<i>"His wife looked
back from behind him</i>

396
00:20:34,214 --> 00:20:36,816
<i>and she became a pillar of salt."</i>

397
00:20:36,817 --> 00:20:40,653
Just when the world thought that
the windows of heaven were closed,

398
00:20:40,654 --> 00:20:43,923
the Lord has granted us a miracle.

399
00:20:43,924 --> 00:20:45,592
And an answer

400
00:20:45,593 --> 00:20:48,728
to life's greatest mystery.

401
00:20:48,729 --> 00:20:52,031
Who was this woman, and
why was she so dead-set

402
00:20:52,032 --> 00:20:53,834
about returning to that hellhole?

403
00:20:54,701 --> 00:20:56,569
<i>Without further ado,</i>

404
00:20:56,570 --> 00:20:59,306
I present to you the
first of what I hope to be

405
00:20:59,307 --> 00:21:02,174
many archaeological discoveries

406
00:21:02,175 --> 00:21:04,810
to prove that the Bible

407
00:21:04,811 --> 00:21:06,580
is true.

408
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:37,578
Hallelujah.

409
00:21:38,645 --> 00:21:40,247
<i>Praise the Lord.</i>

410
00:21:41,082 --> 00:21:42,348
Whoo!

411
00:21:42,349 --> 00:21:44,150
Blessed be.

412
00:21:54,028 --> 00:21:56,662
Whoo.

413
00:22:00,734 --> 00:22:03,169
<i>Thank you. Praise God.</i>

414
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:05,070
Congratulations, Tony.

415
00:22:05,071 --> 00:22:06,640
<i>Impressive turnout today.</i>

416
00:22:06,641 --> 00:22:09,241
Looks like your ministry
is almost relevant again.

417
00:22:09,242 --> 00:22:11,911
Don, this is Dennis Fontaine.

418
00:22:11,912 --> 00:22:14,279
He's from the Friendship Harvest Temple.

419
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:17,517
- Ah, good to meet ya.
- <i>You know, a funny little piece of trivia</i>

420
00:22:18,249 --> 00:22:20,185
- about Mr. Fontaine, he used to be a Satanist.
- Is that right?

421
00:22:20,186 --> 00:22:22,255
Oh, yeah. He was a high priest.

422
00:22:22,256 --> 00:22:24,391
Participated in the orgies, the whole deal.

423
00:22:24,392 --> 00:22:27,259
Then one day he woke up and decided
he was playin' for the wrong team.

424
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:28,795
Decided to become a Christian.

425
00:22:28,796 --> 00:22:31,096
Quite a discovery you've made here.

426
00:22:31,097 --> 00:22:32,865
Where exactly was it located?

427
00:22:32,866 --> 00:22:35,934
In the Valley of Sittim,
Southern tip of the Dead Sea.

428
00:22:35,935 --> 00:22:38,137
Ah, I'm sure it was.

429
00:22:38,138 --> 00:22:39,939
My colleague Dr. Stanley here

430
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:42,275
teaches life sciences
at Sioux Valley Vo-Tech.

431
00:22:42,276 --> 00:22:44,844
<i>He was wondering if he could
take a sample back to his lab</i>

432
00:22:44,845 --> 00:22:46,945
<i>for carbon dating purposes?</i>

433
00:22:46,946 --> 00:22:50,383
What makes you think you can carbon
date the wrath of the Almighty?

434
00:22:50,384 --> 00:22:53,353
<i>Besides, anyone with a brain
knows that carbon dating</i>

435
00:22:53,354 --> 00:22:56,823
<i>is completely ineffective when
dealing with mineralized fossil.</i>

436
00:22:56,824 --> 00:22:58,258
The isotopes are rendered useless.

437
00:22:58,259 --> 00:22:59,858
Why don't you leave the science

438
00:22:59,859 --> 00:23:02,027
to the scientists, Mr. Verdean?

439
00:23:02,028 --> 00:23:04,831
Why don't you leave the things
of God in the hands of his people?

440
00:23:04,832 --> 00:23:08,034
Just thought you boys might like some
forensic data to back up your claims.

441
00:23:08,035 --> 00:23:11,371
But I totally understand if
you're skittish about the results.

442
00:23:11,372 --> 00:23:14,239
I think you might be better off
gettin' some of your own lab work done,

443
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,710
<i>make sure your blood ain't loaded
with V.D. from your Satanic orgy days.</i>

444
00:23:17,711 --> 00:23:19,211
Hey, you better watch yourself.

445
00:23:19,212 --> 00:23:21,114
You better watch yourself.
Fontaine, get ahold of

446
00:23:21,115 --> 00:23:23,883
"Planet of the Apes" here.

447
00:23:23,884 --> 00:23:27,152
You put this jackrabbit in a
corner, he's gonna find a way out.

448
00:23:27,153 --> 00:23:28,922
Look, you can avoid the facts all you want,

449
00:23:28,923 --> 00:23:31,156
but sooner or later
people will want the truth.

450
00:23:31,157 --> 00:23:33,360
Get ready for it.

451
00:23:37,263 --> 00:23:40,266
Fontaine!

452
00:23:40,267 --> 00:23:42,367
I know you'd like to take a
sample back to your machine,

453
00:23:42,368 --> 00:23:43,870
but you can find out what it's made of

454
00:23:43,871 --> 00:23:45,739
right now with a good,
old-fashioned lick test.

455
00:23:53,513 --> 00:23:56,015
What in the world was that?

456
00:23:56,016 --> 00:23:59,285
I believe that was some
sort of demonic hiss.

457
00:23:59,286 --> 00:24:02,290
Yo, Don, I'm not so sure that
was a wise move to challenge him.

458
00:24:11,798 --> 00:24:13,232
<i>I don't think you could have asked</i>

459
00:24:13,233 --> 00:24:14,933
for a better reaction today.

460
00:24:14,934 --> 00:24:16,970
The look on everyone's
faces should be bottled up

461
00:24:16,971 --> 00:24:19,037
and sold as an anti-depressant.

462
00:24:19,038 --> 00:24:20,607
Mm-hmm.

463
00:24:22,143 --> 00:24:25,111
Oh, that Joylinda's a real surprise.

464
00:24:25,112 --> 00:24:28,847
She and Tony are perfect for each other.

465
00:24:28,848 --> 00:24:31,316
It's a shame they can't have any kids.

466
00:24:31,317 --> 00:24:33,452
<i>You know, doctor's
say a woman her age...</i>

467
00:24:33,453 --> 00:24:36,088
she should have plenty of fresh eggs.

468
00:24:36,089 --> 00:24:39,191
What in the world are you jabberin' about?

469
00:24:39,192 --> 00:24:41,460
Oh, I'm sorry.

470
00:24:41,461 --> 00:24:45,198
Seems like that pastor may
have shaken you up a bit.

471
00:24:45,199 --> 00:24:48,200
I've had to deal with vipers
like him my whole life.

472
00:24:48,201 --> 00:24:50,002
Nothin' but bottom-dwellers

473
00:24:50,003 --> 00:24:52,238
tryin' to destroy the work.

474
00:24:52,239 --> 00:24:55,441
Oh, I know, but you just gotta
let it just roll right off you.

475
00:24:55,442 --> 00:24:59,077
Well, now, Carol, you need to learn
your place in this partnership.

476
00:24:59,078 --> 00:25:02,147
<i>And right now I need
you to stay quiet</i>

477
00:25:02,148 --> 00:25:04,851
when I think things through.

478
00:25:08,454 --> 00:25:10,422
You know, in the eight
months that you've known me,

479
00:25:10,423 --> 00:25:13,026
you've never asked me one
thing about my personal life.

480
00:25:13,027 --> 00:25:15,995
I-I-I assumed it was a
professional courtesy,

481
00:25:15,996 --> 00:25:19,833
but now I realize you think of
me as a mindless subordinate.

482
00:25:19,834 --> 00:25:21,835
Now, Carol, that's not true.

483
00:25:21,836 --> 00:25:23,970
I just never thought
you had a personal life.

484
00:25:23,971 --> 00:25:26,940
Well, if you cared to ask...

485
00:25:26,941 --> 00:25:29,444
you'd learn that I have a son in prison.

486
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:35,181
Carol, I-I-I had no
idea you had a son.

487
00:25:39,519 --> 00:25:42,255
<i>He was my youthful indiscretion.</i>

488
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:47,594
Sometimes I feel like that French
whore from "Les Misérables."

489
00:25:55,536 --> 00:25:57,704
I'm sorry to hear that.

490
00:25:58,939 --> 00:26:01,374
How'd your son end up in prison?

491
00:26:01,375 --> 00:26:04,277
Well, he said he was starting to become

492
00:26:04,278 --> 00:26:07,479
a Forest Ranger, but he was
actually growing cannabis

493
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:10,048
in Zion National Park.

494
00:26:10,049 --> 00:26:11,483
Three tons of it.

495
00:26:11,484 --> 00:26:14,887
Good Lord be, that's some serious weed.

496
00:26:14,888 --> 00:26:17,190
Yeah.

497
00:26:17,191 --> 00:26:19,491
Now he's servin' a 12-year sentence.

498
00:26:19,492 --> 00:26:22,629
<i>It's a heavy burden
for a single mother.</i>

499
00:26:25,531 --> 00:26:28,534
All I've ever wished for that
boy is to have a father figure.

500
00:26:28,535 --> 00:26:30,905
He just needed a dad.

501
00:26:33,507 --> 00:26:36,477
I can't believe you've
shouldered this all by yourself.

502
00:26:37,577 --> 00:26:39,379
My life's just been a train wreck.

503
00:26:40,681 --> 00:26:42,681
But ever since I started workin' for you,

504
00:26:42,682 --> 00:26:46,253
I feel like it's slowly
gettin' back on the right track.

505
00:26:51,625 --> 00:26:54,761
Carol, I want you to know
that I'm here for you.

506
00:26:56,130 --> 00:26:57,997
I'm glad you shared that with me.

507
00:26:57,998 --> 00:27:00,600
I-I know it can't be easy bein' the mother

508
00:27:00,601 --> 00:27:03,536
of a dope slinger, but know that God

509
00:27:03,537 --> 00:27:06,338
can heal even the worst of sinners.

510
00:27:06,339 --> 00:27:10,043
He doesn't want anything
to do with that right now.

511
00:27:10,044 --> 00:27:13,313
Well, he'll come 'round.
We'll get that boy saved

512
00:27:13,314 --> 00:27:15,647
if it's the last thing we do.

513
00:27:15,648 --> 00:27:18,050
Now have a bite of your bacon.

514
00:27:22,655 --> 00:27:24,390
Gotta have your protein.

515
00:27:24,391 --> 00:27:26,291
Praise God.

516
00:27:29,529 --> 00:27:31,064
Donald, I'm gonna go ahead
and swing for the fences

517
00:27:31,065 --> 00:27:32,297
with this one, all right?

518
00:27:32,298 --> 00:27:34,366
We're battin' 1,000, so why not?

519
00:27:34,367 --> 00:27:36,669
Lot's wife has gone over like gangbusters,

520
00:27:36,670 --> 00:27:38,337
and we cannot succumb to a sophomore slump.

521
00:27:38,338 --> 00:27:40,105
We need to come correct.

522
00:27:40,106 --> 00:27:42,709
<i>I think the very next
artifact we go after,</i>

523
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:45,713
Ark of the Covenant.

524
00:27:47,681 --> 00:27:49,982
Well, that's a great idea, Tony, but, uh,

525
00:27:49,983 --> 00:27:51,517
we already know where she is.

526
00:27:51,518 --> 00:27:53,652
We do?

527
00:27:53,653 --> 00:27:56,588
- Where?
- <i>Ethiopia.</i>

528
00:27:56,589 --> 00:27:58,156
It's rested there for hundreds of years

529
00:27:58,157 --> 00:28:00,526
at the church of Our
Lady Mary of Zion in Axum.

530
00:28:00,527 --> 00:28:04,130
It's watched over by a
single guardian monk 24/7.

531
00:28:04,131 --> 00:28:06,234
Does this monk know martial arts?

532
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:09,568
Tell me this, is there anything into

533
00:28:09,569 --> 00:28:12,238
tryin' to strike up some sort of
friendship with this monk fella?

534
00:28:12,239 --> 00:28:14,239
<i>Convince him to bring
the Ark over here?</i>

535
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,775
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

536
00:28:15,776 --> 00:28:18,010
Years ago, I tried to make
small talk with the fellow

537
00:28:18,011 --> 00:28:21,314
when he came up for air... not a good idea.

538
00:28:21,315 --> 00:28:23,682
Besides, if anyone actually sees the Ark,

539
00:28:23,683 --> 00:28:25,450
they will implode.

540
00:28:25,451 --> 00:28:28,653
Whoo. Well, that sounds
like that would suck.

541
00:28:28,654 --> 00:28:30,523
Frankincense.

542
00:28:31,657 --> 00:28:33,492
Penicillin.

543
00:28:33,493 --> 00:28:36,362
Sweetheart, those are wonderful
ideas, they really are,

544
00:28:36,363 --> 00:28:39,164
<i>but, uh, we don't need
to waste Don's time</i>

545
00:28:39,165 --> 00:28:41,467
findin' penicillin, baby,

546
00:28:41,468 --> 00:28:44,037
'cause we are... the
world has that already.

547
00:28:44,038 --> 00:28:47,239
What about a scuba expedition
to the bottom of the Red Sea?

548
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,642
Search for the remains of Pharaoh's army?

549
00:28:49,643 --> 00:28:52,478
Gold chariots, breastplates, and the like?

550
00:28:52,479 --> 00:28:56,315
Well, the Red Sea's roughly
170,000 square miles of open water.

551
00:28:56,316 --> 00:28:58,450
I'm not sure I'd know where to begin.

552
00:28:58,451 --> 00:29:00,252
Well, I'll tell you where to begin, Don.

553
00:29:00,253 --> 00:29:02,654
- Faith.
- You got me there.

554
00:29:02,655 --> 00:29:06,726
But dredging the ocean floor's an operation
that's way out of our budget range.

555
00:29:06,727 --> 00:29:10,595
<i>I'd say our current resources are
best suited for land excavation.</i>

556
00:29:10,596 --> 00:29:12,498
Don, this is hard.

557
00:29:12,499 --> 00:29:15,401
Oh, this is tough. I
got a jumble of thoughts

558
00:29:15,402 --> 00:29:17,069
just going on like there's a fog.

559
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:19,506
Like Lucifer has farted inside my brain.

560
00:29:20,773 --> 00:29:22,341
<i>Well, what sort of, uh,</i>

561
00:29:22,342 --> 00:29:23,944
artifacts do you think
will be more reasonable?

562
00:29:25,546 --> 00:29:28,683
Well, there's one object
that's eluded me for years.

563
00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:32,418
I'm goin' after...

564
00:29:32,419 --> 00:29:34,822
the Goliath skull.

565
00:29:35,823 --> 00:29:37,491
<i>That is brilliant.</i>

566
00:29:38,291 --> 00:29:39,659
<i>Goliath's skull.</i>

567
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:43,362
Don, I'm gonna get you some SkyMiles

568
00:29:43,363 --> 00:29:46,434
and we're gonna get you to Israel.

569
00:29:48,669 --> 00:29:50,536
You know about the road to Jericho?

570
00:29:50,537 --> 00:29:52,738
- No, I don't.
- Well, it's a long story.

571
00:29:52,739 --> 00:29:55,307
I don't want to get into it right
now, but the Valley of Kidron

572
00:29:55,308 --> 00:29:58,478
and the Valley of Josaphat...
I'm stuck between left and right.

573
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:23,635
So, Carol, is this your first time

574
00:30:23,636 --> 00:30:25,839
in the Valley of Elah?

575
00:30:30,676 --> 00:30:34,680
Okay, right now we're
standing in the very creek bed

576
00:30:34,681 --> 00:30:38,151
where David collected his five stones.

577
00:30:38,152 --> 00:30:42,755
That means the Philistine army
would have camped over here

578
00:30:42,756 --> 00:30:45,223
and the Israelites would have camped...

579
00:30:45,224 --> 00:30:47,226
over there.

580
00:30:47,227 --> 00:30:48,728
Yeah.

581
00:30:48,729 --> 00:30:51,264
Yeah. Yeah.

582
00:30:51,265 --> 00:30:52,800
Yeah.

583
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:12,250
Military protocol of the day

584
00:31:12,251 --> 00:31:13,952
would put David and Goliath somewhere

585
00:31:13,953 --> 00:31:16,489
right here in the middle.

586
00:31:16,490 --> 00:31:18,723
To pinpoint a more exact location,

587
00:31:18,724 --> 00:31:20,325
you go stand over there, Boaz.

588
00:31:20,326 --> 00:31:22,795
Let's see how this thing
would've played out.

589
00:31:26,333 --> 00:31:29,470
You better not sling that rock at me, Don.

590
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:31,938
This will give us a general area

591
00:31:31,939 --> 00:31:35,473
of where they might have buried the skull.

592
00:31:35,474 --> 00:31:40,246
<i>Hold that shovel above your
head so I have about six cubits.</i>

593
00:31:40,247 --> 00:31:43,382
Now, if I'm David, I'm
thinkin', "I've got to swing

594
00:31:43,383 --> 00:31:46,219
this contraption as hard as I can.

595
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:48,887
I'm probably only gonna
get one chance at this."

596
00:31:48,888 --> 00:31:51,390
<i>And then David begins to pray</i>

597
00:31:51,391 --> 00:31:52,892
for a kill shot right between

598
00:31:52,893 --> 00:31:56,362
the Philistine's eyes.

599
00:31:56,363 --> 00:31:57,829
<i>Carol!</i>

600
00:31:57,830 --> 00:31:59,899
Carol!

601
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:01,800
Are you all right?

602
00:32:01,801 --> 00:32:04,836
- You hit her in the uterus, Don.
- I am so sorry, Carol.

603
00:32:04,837 --> 00:32:07,640
The sling just fell apart on me

604
00:32:07,641 --> 00:32:10,375
it's... it's... it's clearly
not a reliable weapon.

605
00:32:10,376 --> 00:32:12,478
- Can you breathe?
- Yeah.

606
00:32:12,479 --> 00:32:15,215
Well, let's all gather
'round for a word of prayer.

607
00:32:16,016 --> 00:32:17,785
Okay.

608
00:32:21,788 --> 00:32:24,289
Dear Lord, we are indeed grateful

609
00:32:24,290 --> 00:32:25,725
that Carol's flesh was not harmed.

610
00:32:25,726 --> 00:32:27,526
Bless her with renewed vigor.

611
00:32:27,527 --> 00:32:31,396
We pray, Lord, that when I throw
this river stone in the air,

612
00:32:31,397 --> 00:32:33,633
that it may land in the general area

613
00:32:33,634 --> 00:32:35,800
of where we should begin to dig,

614
00:32:35,801 --> 00:32:38,837
that we might be able to locate the remains

615
00:32:38,838 --> 00:32:40,573
of that heartless Philistine.

616
00:32:40,574 --> 00:32:44,111
Yay, even Goliath. Amen.

617
00:32:46,913 --> 00:32:48,948
All right, there she is.

618
00:32:48,949 --> 00:32:50,784
Let's start diggin'.

619
00:33:07,034 --> 00:33:09,302
"Remember, my child, I
never said it would be easy,

620
00:33:09,303 --> 00:33:10,771
I only said it would be worth it."

621
00:33:11,704 --> 00:33:14,507
Our Lord and Savior said that.

622
00:33:14,508 --> 00:33:16,508
I know you people don't
respect him as a deity,

623
00:33:16,509 --> 00:33:19,444
so I figured you may have missed
one of his best one-liners.

624
00:33:24,617 --> 00:33:27,819
Hey! Hey!

625
00:33:29,722 --> 00:33:30,956
Stay cool, I'll handle this.

626
00:33:32,858 --> 00:33:35,261
<i>Shabbat shalom.</i>

627
00:33:37,064 --> 00:33:39,565
- Mazel tov. Mazel tov.
- He says it's illegal to dig here.

628
00:33:39,566 --> 00:33:42,034
Why are you digging here?

629
00:33:42,035 --> 00:33:43,635
He said, "Shut your face, you."

630
00:33:43,636 --> 00:33:45,438
Hey!

631
00:33:46,807 --> 00:33:48,406
Well, I was told to pack a shovel

632
00:33:48,407 --> 00:33:51,043
when touring these parts
in case of inclement bowels.

633
00:33:51,044 --> 00:33:52,510
No toilets anywhere.

634
00:33:55,048 --> 00:33:56,614
He says you can't come here

635
00:33:56,615 --> 00:33:58,817
to our country and bury your caca.

636
00:34:05,392 --> 00:34:07,058
You need a government permit to dig here.

637
00:34:12,065 --> 00:34:14,567
If we don't put it back, everybody to jail.

638
00:34:14,568 --> 00:34:16,000
Move!

639
00:34:16,001 --> 00:34:17,770
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

640
00:34:17,771 --> 00:34:21,040
There's no need for that.

641
00:34:21,041 --> 00:34:23,676
Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

642
00:34:25,512 --> 00:34:28,881
We will return everything
to exactly the way it was

643
00:34:28,882 --> 00:34:30,549
and be on our way.

644
00:34:32,518 --> 00:34:33,919
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

645
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:36,624
<i>Thank you.</i>

646
00:35:02,416 --> 00:35:05,951
- This is Don.
- <i>Don, it's Tony. How are ya?</i>

647
00:35:05,952 --> 00:35:08,821
I'm good, Tony, I'm really... I'm good.

648
00:35:08,822 --> 00:35:11,624
How's everything goin' there? I just
really wanted to check up on your progress.

649
00:35:11,625 --> 00:35:13,426
You know, people are
chompin' at the bit here

650
00:35:13,427 --> 00:35:14,826
to see the head of that Philistine.

651
00:35:14,827 --> 00:35:17,596
Well, Tony, I...

652
00:35:17,597 --> 00:35:20,799
- we're gettin' close.
- Yeah, you think you'll be able

653
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,435
to wrap it up there in the next day or two?

654
00:35:22,436 --> 00:35:24,438
I know your return trip is on Friday.

655
00:35:26,539 --> 00:35:30,109
Praise God, I think there's an 80% chance.

656
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:33,611
Those odds have me a little worried, Don.

657
00:35:33,612 --> 00:35:36,448
Well, we've already
located the burial site.

658
00:35:36,449 --> 00:35:38,683
At this point, it's
just a matter of digging.

659
00:35:38,684 --> 00:35:40,752
Hmm. Okay.

660
00:35:40,753 --> 00:35:42,821
Well, I gotta be honest with you, Don,

661
00:35:42,822 --> 00:35:44,556
we need that skull.

662
00:35:44,557 --> 00:35:48,060
<i>The fate of thousands
of people's very souls</i>

663
00:35:48,061 --> 00:35:50,729
- <i>are in the balance here.</i>
- I understand that.

664
00:35:50,730 --> 00:35:53,466
<i>I mean, their fate is... is
barely hangin' on by a thread.</i>

665
00:35:53,467 --> 00:35:54,966
If they do not have this second witness,

666
00:35:54,967 --> 00:35:56,634
we could lose these people forever.

667
00:35:56,635 --> 00:35:58,439
Can you imagine that?

668
00:35:59,739 --> 00:36:01,739
I promise you, I will not return

669
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:04,810
until I have Goliath's head in my carryon.

670
00:36:04,811 --> 00:36:07,580
All right. Well, I never doubted you, Don.

671
00:36:07,581 --> 00:36:09,482
Why don't you go ahead
and get some shut eye?

672
00:36:09,483 --> 00:36:11,683
I'm sure it's pretty late
over there in the Holy Land.

673
00:36:11,684 --> 00:36:13,551
Will do, Tony. Thank you.

674
00:36:13,552 --> 00:36:14,953
<i>God speed. Good night to you.</i>

675
00:37:10,943 --> 00:37:13,180
Come on, now.

676
00:37:18,985 --> 00:37:21,455
Please don't be cremated.

677
00:38:17,143 --> 00:38:21,613
Dear Lord, please forgive
me for what I'm about to do.

678
00:38:21,614 --> 00:38:25,618
And I know that someday
this man will be resurrected

679
00:38:25,619 --> 00:38:27,886
and his members will be made whole again.

680
00:38:27,887 --> 00:38:31,991
Until that day comes,
I pray that his remains

681
00:38:31,992 --> 00:38:33,859
will be put to good use

682
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:37,029
and bring You many new souls unto Thee.

683
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:39,032
Amen.

684
00:40:23,836 --> 00:40:27,171
- Hello?
- <i>Carol, I need you to wake up.</i>

685
00:40:27,172 --> 00:40:29,108
I'm up.

686
00:40:31,177 --> 00:40:33,145
<i>I was wrong about our
location yesterday.</i>

687
00:40:33,146 --> 00:40:35,046
<i>They never would've
buried Goliath there.</i>

688
00:40:35,047 --> 00:40:36,515
<i>It's just too obvious.</i>

689
00:40:36,516 --> 00:40:38,984
That police officer yesterday was God's way

690
00:40:38,985 --> 00:40:41,386
of telling us that we
were on the wrong path.

691
00:40:41,387 --> 00:40:43,756
Well, where could it be, then?

692
00:40:43,757 --> 00:40:47,093
Praise God, we'll find out.

693
00:40:54,934 --> 00:40:56,502
<i>What is this place?</i>

694
00:40:56,503 --> 00:40:58,203
This is the ancient village of Gath.

695
00:40:58,204 --> 00:41:00,071
Goliath's birthplace.

696
00:41:00,072 --> 00:41:02,841
We all need to keep our eyes
peeled for any natural landmarks...

697
00:41:02,842 --> 00:41:06,410
a... a monument of sorts.

698
00:41:06,411 --> 00:41:08,614
What about that monolith right there?

699
00:41:09,449 --> 00:41:12,252
- What monolith?
- Right there.

700
00:41:15,954 --> 00:41:19,158
That's not a bad idea.

701
00:41:19,159 --> 00:41:21,294
All right, boys, let's head over there.

702
00:41:22,929 --> 00:41:24,997
Good thinkin' there, Carol.

703
00:41:24,998 --> 00:41:27,533
You have really great ideas, Carol.

704
00:41:32,137 --> 00:41:34,205
All right, Carol, this is your call.

705
00:41:34,206 --> 00:41:37,009
You take the lead on this one.

706
00:41:37,010 --> 00:41:39,343
Well, to me,

707
00:41:39,344 --> 00:41:41,046
this monolith represents

708
00:41:41,047 --> 00:41:43,281
the physical strength of Goliath.

709
00:41:43,282 --> 00:41:45,584
So, it only makes sense
that they would've used

710
00:41:45,585 --> 00:41:48,352
something like this as a grave marker.

711
00:41:48,353 --> 00:41:50,122
Dang, you're a natural.

712
00:41:50,123 --> 00:41:52,559
<i>Where should we start digging?</i>

713
00:41:54,494 --> 00:41:56,428
Right here.

714
00:41:56,429 --> 00:41:58,230
All right, boys, you heard the lady.

715
00:41:58,231 --> 00:41:59,432
Let's get to it.

716
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,100
Everyone be careful. Most Philistine graves

717
00:42:03,101 --> 00:42:05,136
in this region are quite shallow.

718
00:42:05,137 --> 00:42:06,504
That being said, let's dig fast.

719
00:42:06,505 --> 00:42:08,707
Don't want any looky-loos showin' up.

720
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,749
Don.

721
00:42:18,318 --> 00:42:20,151
I hit something.

722
00:42:20,152 --> 00:42:21,986
Okay. Ho, ho, ho... everyone stop.

723
00:42:21,987 --> 00:42:24,323
- Where is it?
- Right there.

724
00:42:29,262 --> 00:42:32,232
Carol, can you hand me
that brush from my kit?

725
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:37,703
- I can see a chunk of bone.
- Let's not get carried away.

726
00:42:43,976 --> 00:42:46,011
Ooh! Is that the dome of a skull?!

727
00:42:46,012 --> 00:42:48,279
Phew. Certainly appears that way.

728
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:50,517
Wow.

729
00:42:52,918 --> 00:42:54,518
<i>Carol, would you do the honors?</i>

730
00:42:54,519 --> 00:42:56,455
No, I'm afraid I'll break it. You do it.

731
00:42:56,456 --> 00:42:58,323
All right, next time.

732
00:42:58,324 --> 00:43:00,127
Get that bag ready.

733
00:43:09,068 --> 00:43:11,238
Oh, my God.

734
00:43:14,206 --> 00:43:16,308
I don't believe it. That's...

735
00:43:16,309 --> 00:43:17,711
the skull of Goliath.

736
00:43:19,244 --> 00:43:22,413
Hey! Hey! T-these guys just
found the skull of Goliath!

737
00:43:22,414 --> 00:43:24,251
All right. Let's get out of here.

738
00:43:33,592 --> 00:43:35,593
<i>Can I come in, Don?</i>

739
00:43:35,594 --> 00:43:37,897
<i>Sure. What can I do you for?</i>

740
00:43:42,001 --> 00:43:45,470
I was just thinking about the
incredible discovery we made today.

741
00:43:45,471 --> 00:43:48,339
Another big win for Christianity, huh?

742
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:50,075
Your people, too.

743
00:43:50,076 --> 00:43:51,977
You should be proud of
yourself. <i>Shalom.</i>

744
00:43:51,978 --> 00:43:54,578
<i>Your shovel made first contact.</i>

745
00:43:54,579 --> 00:43:56,480
I guess you're right.

746
00:43:56,481 --> 00:44:00,185
<i>I just found it a
little strange that...</i>

747
00:44:00,186 --> 00:44:02,053
we found the skull

748
00:44:02,054 --> 00:44:05,357
in the very first place we started digging.

749
00:44:05,358 --> 00:44:08,627
<i>My brother and I both agree
that that ground felt very soft.</i>

750
00:44:08,628 --> 00:44:12,363
Almost like somebody had already dug it up.

751
00:44:12,364 --> 00:44:15,067
I'm sure you can guess where
I'm going with this, Don.

752
00:44:15,068 --> 00:44:17,401
No, Boaz. Actually, I don't.

753
00:44:17,402 --> 00:44:21,372
Oh, don't you? It just seemed a
bit convenient, don't you think?

754
00:44:21,373 --> 00:44:25,042
What we experienced today is
nothing short of a miracle.

755
00:44:25,043 --> 00:44:27,712
Don't ever forget that.
God has always said,

756
00:44:27,713 --> 00:44:30,348
<i>"My ways are not your ways."</i>

757
00:44:34,152 --> 00:44:36,321
- Hey, hey. Hey, hey.
- What the hell?

758
00:44:36,322 --> 00:44:38,390
- Hey, hey, hey. Mind your business.
- What is wrong with you?!

759
00:44:38,391 --> 00:44:40,392
You sick, sick man, Don.

760
00:44:40,393 --> 00:44:43,495
Easy, now, Boaz. Let's... let's
talk about this, all right?

761
00:44:43,496 --> 00:44:44,997
No, there's nothing to talk about.

762
00:44:44,998 --> 00:44:46,564
You're a grave robbing creep!

763
00:44:46,565 --> 00:44:50,167
<i>Dismembering the head
of Johnny Jerusalem?!</i>

764
00:44:50,168 --> 00:44:52,337
Johnny Jerusalem is a hero here!

765
00:44:52,338 --> 00:44:55,040
Listen to me now, Boaz!

766
00:44:55,041 --> 00:44:57,009
I was always gonna put him back.

767
00:44:57,010 --> 00:44:58,676
Give him the proper hero's burial,

768
00:44:58,677 --> 00:45:02,013
but you need to understand
why I had to do this.

769
00:45:02,014 --> 00:45:05,183
<i>I-I-I'm doin' it for
the good of everyone.</i>

770
00:45:05,184 --> 00:45:08,220
I should report you to
the authorities right now.

771
00:45:08,221 --> 00:45:10,555
Let's not be rash here.

772
00:45:10,556 --> 00:45:13,792
I'm sure there's somethin'
we can work out between us.

773
00:45:13,793 --> 00:45:15,426
You trying to bribe me, Don?

774
00:45:15,427 --> 00:45:17,796
<i>I don't want your filthy</i> luka.

775
00:45:17,797 --> 00:45:20,332
Well, wh... what do you want?

776
00:45:22,201 --> 00:45:24,169
I want to come to the States.

777
00:45:24,170 --> 00:45:27,471
<i>I want to live the
American Dream for a while.</i>

778
00:45:27,472 --> 00:45:30,743
And get a Pontiac.

779
00:45:32,077 --> 00:45:34,446
And I want the Levi's jeans,

780
00:45:34,447 --> 00:45:37,448
acid wash, super taper.

781
00:45:37,449 --> 00:45:40,518
<i>Like John Stamos.</i>

782
00:45:40,519 --> 00:45:44,221
I want a wife, Don. I'm lonely here.

783
00:45:44,222 --> 00:45:47,459
<i>She has to be gentle</i>

784
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:52,296
and sweet and hot like stripper.

785
00:45:52,297 --> 00:45:55,067
Well, that can be arranged.

786
00:45:55,068 --> 00:45:56,600
But on one condition, now.

787
00:45:56,601 --> 00:45:59,136
<i>I need you to bear
witness to the skull.</i>

788
00:45:59,137 --> 00:46:02,274
You're gonna have to be
a part of this for a bit.

789
00:46:02,275 --> 00:46:04,142
Maybe even share how the experience

790
00:46:04,143 --> 00:46:06,377
has caused you to consider Christianity,

791
00:46:06,378 --> 00:46:09,214
<i>but you're still on the
fence about the whole ordeal.</i>

792
00:46:09,215 --> 00:46:13,285
Christians love hearin' that
thing from a real-live Jew.

793
00:46:13,286 --> 00:46:16,856
<i>What do you say? Do we have a deal?</i>

794
00:46:22,128 --> 00:46:25,464
You better start lining up
some hot chicks for me, Don.

795
00:46:26,398 --> 00:46:28,334
<i>Amen.</i>

796
00:46:47,753 --> 00:46:50,388
<i>Hey, t-these guys just
found the skull of Goliath!</i>

797
00:46:50,389 --> 00:46:51,890
Let's get out of here.

798
00:46:51,891 --> 00:46:54,125
One of those tourists
uploaded it this morning.

799
00:46:54,126 --> 00:46:56,160
It already has over 1,000 views.

800
00:46:56,161 --> 00:46:58,395
Let's hope the authorities don't
see it before we're airborne.

801
00:46:58,396 --> 00:47:00,265
Put that away.

802
00:47:00,266 --> 00:47:03,267
They got a lot of undercovers
on these Jew planes.

803
00:47:05,737 --> 00:47:07,571
Stick it below the seat in front of ya.

804
00:47:07,572 --> 00:47:09,641
Sorry, Carol.

805
00:47:11,510 --> 00:47:13,511
Keep a close eye on it. Be gentle, now.

806
00:47:19,418 --> 00:47:21,588
I think it's broken.

807
00:47:24,856 --> 00:47:28,493
If Satan can get in there and get
you to start your day off wrong,

808
00:47:28,494 --> 00:47:30,694
he's gonna do it. Trust me.

809
00:47:30,695 --> 00:47:33,430
And he's gonna do it
through breakfast cereal.

810
00:47:33,431 --> 00:47:35,433
Kay?

811
00:47:35,434 --> 00:47:38,470
<i>Listen to some of the deviant
names of these cereals.</i>

812
00:47:38,471 --> 00:47:41,705
Grape-Nuts.

813
00:47:41,706 --> 00:47:43,707
Grape-Nuts!

814
00:47:43,708 --> 00:47:45,944
Nice try, Satan.

815
00:47:45,945 --> 00:47:49,247
Nuts, testicles.

816
00:47:49,248 --> 00:47:52,616
Come on. Don't get that image
in my head in the morning.

817
00:47:52,617 --> 00:47:55,620
Banana Nut Crunch.

818
00:47:55,621 --> 00:47:58,223
Yeah, we know what the nuts
are, we've established that.

819
00:47:58,224 --> 00:48:00,392
Bananas?

820
00:48:00,393 --> 00:48:02,493
We know what that is.

821
00:48:02,494 --> 00:48:04,062
It's a penis.

822
00:48:05,565 --> 00:48:07,631
Well, I'm here to tell you
that each and every time

823
00:48:07,632 --> 00:48:10,201
you spoon into a bowl of Lucky Charms,

824
00:48:10,202 --> 00:48:14,538
you might as well be partaking
of Lucifer's sacrament.

825
00:48:14,539 --> 00:48:16,908
<i>I mean, come on!</i>

826
00:48:16,909 --> 00:48:20,779
Turn it around! Let's get God cereal in ya!

827
00:48:20,780 --> 00:48:23,614
Start the day off with a
little God in your life.

828
00:48:23,615 --> 00:48:25,517
You know what I eat?

829
00:48:25,518 --> 00:48:27,651
I eat Life.

830
00:48:27,652 --> 00:48:29,988
I eat Raisin Bran.

831
00:48:29,989 --> 00:48:32,624
I eat Special K.

832
00:48:32,625 --> 00:48:34,625
Right? Special K.

833
00:48:34,626 --> 00:48:36,727
Come... come right now. It's on TV.

834
00:48:36,728 --> 00:48:38,629
Oh. Brothers and sisters,

835
00:48:38,630 --> 00:48:41,033
let's all take a 15-minute recess.

836
00:48:44,769 --> 00:48:48,774
Fontaine, I'm tellin' you, you
could really be screwed here, man.

837
00:48:52,545 --> 00:48:55,546
Ladies and gentlemen, members of the press,

838
00:48:55,547 --> 00:48:57,549
<i>at this time, I would
like to introduce to you</i>

839
00:48:57,550 --> 00:48:59,750
<i>the people sitting here to my left.</i>

840
00:48:59,751 --> 00:49:03,254
First we have Boaz Yohalem,

841
00:49:03,255 --> 00:49:05,823
field supervisor and Israeli national.

842
00:49:05,824 --> 00:49:07,591
<i>Next to him Carol Jensen,</i>

843
00:49:07,592 --> 00:49:09,593
<i>chief research assistant.</i>

844
00:49:09,594 --> 00:49:11,462
And, finally,

845
00:49:11,463 --> 00:49:14,031
world-famous archaeologist,
Donald Verdean.

846
00:49:14,032 --> 00:49:17,736
<i>Mr. Verdean is also
the president and CEO</i>

847
00:49:17,737 --> 00:49:21,705
of BibleQuest Enterprises,
headquartered in Duchesne, Utah.

848
00:49:21,706 --> 00:49:23,942
Now, at this time, I'd
like to hand the floor over

849
00:49:23,943 --> 00:49:25,977
to Mr. Verdean so he can share with you

850
00:49:25,978 --> 00:49:28,513
<i>the evidence of his latest find.</i>

851
00:49:28,514 --> 00:49:30,649
I'm gonna book you a massage right now.

852
00:49:32,652 --> 00:49:33,984
<i>Earlier this month</i>

853
00:49:33,985 --> 00:49:35,787
on a routine dig in Israel,

854
00:49:35,788 --> 00:49:38,290
Miss Jensen, Mr. Yohalem

855
00:49:38,291 --> 00:49:40,024
and myself unearthed the remains

856
00:49:40,025 --> 00:49:42,593
of a very large human skull

857
00:49:42,594 --> 00:49:44,029
containing a river stone

858
00:49:44,030 --> 00:49:47,031
embedded in the frontonasal suture.

859
00:49:47,032 --> 00:49:49,301
This discovery was made in Gath,

860
00:49:49,302 --> 00:49:51,970
the ancient birthplace of Goliath.

861
00:49:51,971 --> 00:49:55,306
And I'm gonna quit talkin' about it

862
00:49:55,307 --> 00:49:57,075
and let you be the judge.

863
00:50:03,416 --> 00:50:05,750
- <i>Mr. Verdean, how tall was he?</i>
- <i>Question. Question.</i>

864
00:50:05,751 --> 00:50:06,884
- <i>Over here.</i>
- <i>Question right here, Mr. Verdean.</i>

865
00:50:06,885 --> 00:50:08,352
I want you to find the home addresses

866
00:50:08,353 --> 00:50:10,754
of everyone involved in this broadcast.

867
00:50:10,755 --> 00:50:12,624
And I want you to go to their homes

868
00:50:12,625 --> 00:50:15,627
and put a dead dog in
each one of their cars.

869
00:50:15,628 --> 00:50:17,629
<i>First question, right over here.</i>

870
00:50:17,630 --> 00:50:19,029
How do you respond to critics

871
00:50:19,030 --> 00:50:21,866
who claim this is all a big hoax?

872
00:50:21,867 --> 00:50:23,368
Well, I invite critics everywhere

873
00:50:23,369 --> 00:50:25,102
to take a good, hard look at the evidence

874
00:50:25,103 --> 00:50:27,772
<i>and, uh, make a decision.</i>

875
00:50:27,773 --> 00:50:31,375
Bone shavings from the skull
will soon be taken to the lab

876
00:50:31,376 --> 00:50:32,977
for radio carbon analysis.

877
00:50:32,978 --> 00:50:36,348
So you see, it's all scientific.

878
00:50:36,349 --> 00:50:38,415
Tell them the truth, Don.

879
00:50:41,052 --> 00:50:43,322
What?

880
00:50:44,757 --> 00:50:47,694
I think you should really tell the truth.

881
00:50:52,063 --> 00:50:54,799
Tell them how we were chased

882
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:58,569
by three al-Qaeda
guys on "motorcyc-les."

883
00:51:01,539 --> 00:51:04,808
Oh, yeah, well, I-I tried
to forget about that.

884
00:51:04,809 --> 00:51:08,981
- It was, uh...
- Will you please tell us about this run-in with al-Qaeda?

885
00:51:09,815 --> 00:51:11,015
Uh...

886
00:51:12,518 --> 00:51:14,451
<i>well, yes, as you already know</i>

887
00:51:14,452 --> 00:51:17,455
word of our discovery spread
quickly and not 10 minutes after

888
00:51:17,456 --> 00:51:19,089
<i>we were on the road with the skull,</i>

889
00:51:19,090 --> 00:51:23,093
we were followed by three
masked men on motorcycles...

890
00:51:23,094 --> 00:51:24,828
<i>With AK-47s.</i>

891
00:51:24,829 --> 00:51:27,131
<i>...with AK-47s. Uh...</i>

892
00:51:27,132 --> 00:51:29,134
I immediately took evasive action

893
00:51:29,135 --> 00:51:31,402
and I knocked all three
of them off the road.

894
00:51:31,403 --> 00:51:35,105
What al-Qaeda would want with the skull

895
00:51:35,106 --> 00:51:37,942
of a Philistine, I have no idea.

896
00:51:37,943 --> 00:51:39,977
They're possibly cloning

897
00:51:39,978 --> 00:51:43,714
an army of giant al-Qaeda guys.

898
00:51:43,715 --> 00:51:45,716
Uh...

899
00:51:45,717 --> 00:51:47,919
What makes you think
they were from al-Qaeda?

900
00:51:49,422 --> 00:51:51,189
Well, I've received numerous death threats

901
00:51:51,190 --> 00:51:53,857
since the incident that, uh...

902
00:51:53,858 --> 00:51:56,026
confirm they were indeed

903
00:51:56,027 --> 00:51:59,264
al-Qaeda operatives.

904
00:52:00,865 --> 00:52:03,801
Indeed they had... were
wearing those crazy hats.

905
00:52:03,802 --> 00:52:06,937
- Thank you, Dan.
- <i>Now, I tell ya, if I had my druthers,</i>

906
00:52:06,938 --> 00:52:09,441
<i>the very next thing
we'd be goin' after...</i>

907
00:52:09,442 --> 00:52:11,743
the wreckage of Noah's vessel.

908
00:52:11,744 --> 00:52:14,479
I'm not talkin' about the Ark, there
was this... an earlier prototype.

909
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:16,147
It's more of a recreational vehicle.

910
00:52:16,148 --> 00:52:19,683
I believe his boys wrecked
it across a rocky shore

911
00:52:19,684 --> 00:52:21,151
when they were gallivanting one evening.

912
00:52:21,152 --> 00:52:23,020
If I can put that piece
of the puzzle together,

913
00:52:23,021 --> 00:52:26,156
I can finally close the door
on all this dinosaur nonsense,

914
00:52:26,157 --> 00:52:28,158
prove that that stuff never existed.

915
00:52:28,159 --> 00:52:30,160
Just a hodgepodge of
different reptilian bones.

916
00:52:30,161 --> 00:52:32,629
I'm sure if you're
familiar with the old, uh,

917
00:52:32,630 --> 00:52:34,999
'80s cartoon "Vultron."

918
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,734
Familiar with that? I believe they were

919
00:52:36,735 --> 00:52:38,136
crime-fighters of some nature.

920
00:52:38,137 --> 00:52:39,904
They all had their own machines,

921
00:52:39,905 --> 00:52:42,774
but together the machines
would form a giant machine.

922
00:52:42,775 --> 00:52:45,709
And I do believe that that
is what we can discover.

923
00:52:45,710 --> 00:52:47,245
That these bones, these relics,

924
00:52:47,246 --> 00:52:49,513
they're just like a little
Vultron of reptilians.

925
00:52:49,514 --> 00:52:53,584
It was all tiny ones kinda
fell together to form something

926
00:52:53,585 --> 00:52:55,387
that looks like a creature.

927
00:52:57,655 --> 00:53:01,692
- Have I lost ya?
- Appreciate you bein' here.

928
00:53:01,693 --> 00:53:03,160
Right.

929
00:53:03,161 --> 00:53:05,197
Well...

930
00:53:07,099 --> 00:53:10,100
Hey, Carol. How you holdin' up?

931
00:53:10,101 --> 00:53:12,069
Boy, I'm sure you're not used to

932
00:53:12,070 --> 00:53:13,504
this much limelight, though.

933
00:53:13,505 --> 00:53:15,205
You really glowed up there today.

934
00:53:15,206 --> 00:53:17,274
Stop it, Don.

935
00:53:17,275 --> 00:53:20,678
Did you plan that
publicity stunt with Boaz?

936
00:53:20,679 --> 00:53:23,214
What? No, no, no.

937
00:53:23,215 --> 00:53:25,082
Because I would like to
be forewarned the next time

938
00:53:25,083 --> 00:53:28,120
you decide to lie to the
entire Christian nation.

939
00:53:31,956 --> 00:53:33,591
Carol, I-I'm... I'm sorry,

940
00:53:33,592 --> 00:53:36,560
but Boaz caught me totally off-guard.

941
00:53:36,561 --> 00:53:38,129
I-I-I didn't
know what to say,

942
00:53:38,130 --> 00:53:39,997
so I just rolled with it.

943
00:53:39,998 --> 00:53:43,067
<i>But I sure as heck didn't
ask him to lie for me.</i>

944
00:53:44,869 --> 00:53:46,203
Well, you know, in life I had to learn

945
00:53:46,204 --> 00:53:48,839
<i>that sometimes the small untruths</i>

946
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:50,741
<i>are necessary for the greater good.</i>

947
00:53:50,742 --> 00:53:52,709
My sentiments exactly.

948
00:53:52,710 --> 00:53:55,580
But you know the second those
lies hurt the ones you love,

949
00:53:55,581 --> 00:53:57,950
the sin is on you.

950
00:54:02,887 --> 00:54:07,125
He also was in the Masad training
program for about three months.

951
00:54:07,126 --> 00:54:09,993
<i>Weapons training,
counter-intelligence,</i>

952
00:54:09,994 --> 00:54:11,995
making booby-traps,

953
00:54:11,996 --> 00:54:14,098
- kicking...
- Would you excuse us for just a moment?

954
00:54:14,099 --> 00:54:15,332
I just want to talk

955
00:54:15,333 --> 00:54:17,634
to Dr. Yohalum for a second.

956
00:54:17,635 --> 00:54:19,604
- I'm just talking to the lady about the...
- Yes. Yes.

957
00:54:19,605 --> 00:54:21,738
What in the Sam Hill were
you thinkin' in there?!

958
00:54:21,739 --> 00:54:24,008
Al-Qaeda, Boaz?! Cloning?!

959
00:54:24,009 --> 00:54:27,178
You don't know a damn heck thing
about the media, do you, Don?

960
00:54:27,179 --> 00:54:30,147
I was saving you up
there! You were suffering.

961
00:54:30,148 --> 00:54:33,750
Those people were bored, they were yawning.

962
00:54:33,751 --> 00:54:36,154
They couldn't give a rat's butthole

963
00:54:36,155 --> 00:54:39,823
about your Goliath skull
until I mentioned al-Qaeda.

964
00:54:39,824 --> 00:54:41,625
We're front page news now.

965
00:54:41,626 --> 00:54:43,627
Everybody wants a piece of us.

966
00:54:43,628 --> 00:54:47,332
Piece of you. Piece of
me. Piece of all of us.

967
00:54:47,333 --> 00:54:49,366
This is my operation, Boaz.

968
00:54:49,367 --> 00:54:52,270
Anything you say or do
need to run by me first!

969
00:54:52,271 --> 00:54:55,372
- You understand?
- Do you understand that we're partners now?

970
00:54:55,373 --> 00:54:59,209
I've started drumming up some
business from some new clients.

971
00:54:59,210 --> 00:55:03,781
- What?!
- We should cut bait with this... this Tony guy.

972
00:55:03,782 --> 00:55:08,185
We could be making serious
<i>luka</i> from big-time collectors.

973
00:55:08,186 --> 00:55:11,055
No, no, no, no. Hold on.
That's not why I do this.

974
00:55:11,056 --> 00:55:14,959
A Chinese billionaire
emailed me two minutes ago.

975
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:17,194
He wants to finance us.

976
00:55:17,195 --> 00:55:20,198
I told him we're onto something big, Don.

977
00:55:20,199 --> 00:55:22,667
Something really big.

978
00:55:22,668 --> 00:55:26,539
The Holy Grail of Biblical artifacts.

979
00:55:28,340 --> 00:55:30,207
And what might that be?

980
00:55:30,208 --> 00:55:33,810
The Holy Grail.

981
00:55:33,811 --> 00:55:36,346
You're an idiot. Are you jokin' me?

982
00:55:36,347 --> 00:55:38,348
I'm not a joking you, Don.

983
00:55:38,349 --> 00:55:43,388
And apparently he just
leaked that to the press.

984
00:55:46,425 --> 00:55:49,660
Well, you've just turned
this into a royal crap storm.

985
00:55:49,661 --> 00:55:52,129
How in the heck are we gonna find that?!

986
00:55:52,130 --> 00:55:55,165
The same way we found the
Goliath skull, I guess.

987
00:55:55,166 --> 00:55:57,502
We fabricate it.

988
00:56:02,106 --> 00:56:03,941
Don't walk away from this, Don.

989
00:56:05,777 --> 00:56:08,446
I'm the one who knows
your dirty little secret.

990
00:56:20,092 --> 00:56:22,392
Don! Hold on. Let me
holler at you for a moment.

991
00:56:22,393 --> 00:56:24,428
Hey, Tony, hey. How are ya?

992
00:56:24,429 --> 00:56:26,698
What's going on? I-I just
talked to a reporter in there.

993
00:56:26,699 --> 00:56:29,000
He said you were thinkin'
about jumpin' ship?

994
00:56:29,001 --> 00:56:31,537
Go work for some Chinese
billionaire. That's not true, is it?

995
00:56:33,072 --> 00:56:36,207
Tony, I don't know what to say.

996
00:56:36,208 --> 00:56:38,276
- <i>A lot of big things have happened today.</i>
- All right, well,

997
00:56:38,277 --> 00:56:39,843
what's he offering you? You gotta give me

998
00:56:39,844 --> 00:56:41,613
the opportunity to match his offer.

999
00:56:43,047 --> 00:56:45,116
Well, Tony, I...

1000
00:56:47,753 --> 00:56:50,888
I'm sorry, Tony, I never
planned it to happen like this,

1001
00:56:50,889 --> 00:56:53,290
<i>but...</i>

1002
00:56:53,291 --> 00:56:57,194
This is just too big an
opportunity to pass up.

1003
00:56:57,195 --> 00:56:59,730
You know, I don't believe this.

1004
00:56:59,731 --> 00:57:01,064
I thought you and I were friends.

1005
00:57:01,065 --> 00:57:03,767
Real soldiers in the Lord's army.

1006
00:57:03,768 --> 00:57:06,504
But you've turned out
to be a Judas Iscariot

1007
00:57:09,041 --> 00:57:10,908
- Wait, Tony, I...
- Good day to you, sir.

1008
00:57:10,909 --> 00:57:13,245
Tony, my hands are tied here! I...

1009
00:57:24,489 --> 00:57:27,959
There are a few items of business
I want to discuss with you.

1010
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:30,160
- Keep your voice down.
- All right.

1011
00:57:30,161 --> 00:57:31,495
First item,

1012
00:57:31,496 --> 00:57:33,964
if you're worried about the analysis

1013
00:57:33,965 --> 00:57:35,866
of the Goliath skull, don't be.

1014
00:57:35,867 --> 00:57:38,269
Boaz has taken care of it.

1015
00:57:40,072 --> 00:57:42,906
- Excuse me?
- <i>I offered the lab tech guy</i>

1016
00:57:42,907 --> 00:57:45,477
10 grand to fake the results.

1017
00:57:47,478 --> 00:57:50,381
- You just what?
- Don't worry about the money, Don.

1018
00:57:50,382 --> 00:57:54,218
I'll take care of that, too.
I'm gonna negotiate an advance

1019
00:57:54,219 --> 00:57:56,888
when we have our Skype
call with Poon-Yen tomorrow.

1020
00:57:56,889 --> 00:57:58,955
Who's Poon-Yen?

1021
00:57:58,956 --> 00:58:02,359
- <i>Poon-Yen.</i>
- That's what I said. Poon-Yen.

1022
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:05,495
No, you said Poon-Yen,
it's Poon-Yen.

1023
00:58:05,496 --> 00:58:07,964
<i>He's the Chinese
guy that's paying us</i>

1024
00:58:07,965 --> 00:58:09,500
to find the Holy Grail.

1025
00:58:09,501 --> 00:58:12,304
<i>Second item of business,</i>

1026
00:58:14,405 --> 00:58:17,309
I want one night with Carol.

1027
00:58:21,079 --> 00:58:22,513
Absolutely not.

1028
00:58:22,514 --> 00:58:24,582
You offered to find me a wife, Don,

1029
00:58:24,583 --> 00:58:26,183
that was part of the deal.

1030
00:58:26,184 --> 00:58:28,386
<i>Just one night with Carol.</i>

1031
00:58:28,387 --> 00:58:31,288
Not lovemaking, just dancing, talking,

1032
00:58:31,289 --> 00:58:34,826
flirting, having fun.
Smelling each other's hair.

1033
00:58:34,827 --> 00:58:36,861
Absolutely not. Carol's her own woman.

1034
00:58:36,862 --> 00:58:38,995
I can't make her do anything.

1035
00:58:38,996 --> 00:58:42,332
You and I both know that she'll do
just about anything for the cause.

1036
00:58:42,333 --> 00:58:44,100
I need you to make this happen, Don.

1037
00:58:44,101 --> 00:58:46,405
Don't forget about what's at stake here.

1038
00:58:47,539 --> 00:58:49,006
<i>I'll see you 9:00 AM tomorrow</i>

1039
00:58:49,007 --> 00:58:50,875
<i>for the Skype call with Poon-Yen.</i>

1040
00:58:50,876 --> 00:58:54,313
Make up a good story about
where we find this Grail.

1041
00:58:56,014 --> 00:58:58,216
Boaz.

1042
00:58:59,217 --> 00:59:01,218
Boaz.

1043
00:59:13,498 --> 00:59:15,866
- Hello?
- <i>Carol, it's Don.</i>

1044
00:59:15,867 --> 00:59:18,335
- Hi.
- <i>Carol, I'm sure you've heard already,</i>

1045
00:59:18,336 --> 00:59:20,337
<i>but I-I just wanna tell you myself.</i>

1046
00:59:20,338 --> 00:59:22,205
<i>We're now being financed</i>

1047
00:59:22,206 --> 00:59:24,308
<i>by a wealthy Christian
fellow from China.</i>

1048
00:59:24,309 --> 00:59:26,877
<i>Oh, I know, it's all
over the Internet.</i>

1049
00:59:26,878 --> 00:59:28,613
<i>What did Tony say?</i>

1050
00:59:28,614 --> 00:59:31,549
Well, he didn't take very kindly to it,

1051
00:59:31,550 --> 00:59:34,285
but, uh, we're still on the Lord's
errand and that's what matters.

1052
00:59:34,286 --> 00:59:38,455
<i>Uh... uh, Carol, I had a great
conversation with Boaz today.</i>

1053
00:59:38,456 --> 00:59:41,058
He was askin' me all
kinds of deep questions

1054
00:59:41,059 --> 00:59:44,060
about Christianity and
the search for truth.

1055
00:59:44,061 --> 00:59:46,897
I think he might be
interested in gettin' saved.

1056
00:59:46,898 --> 00:59:49,200
<i>Really? Oh, that's wonderful.</i>

1057
00:59:50,601 --> 00:59:52,502
<i>I was wonderin' if you might be able</i>

1058
00:59:52,503 --> 00:59:54,337
<i>to spend some time with
him tomorrow night,</i>

1059
00:59:54,338 --> 00:59:56,674
bear witness of your conversion story.

1060
00:59:56,675 --> 01:00:00,011
I think that might help him get to
the finish line a little quicker.

1061
01:00:00,012 --> 01:00:03,180
<i>Oh, absolutely! It
would be my pleasure!</i>

1062
01:00:03,181 --> 01:00:06,082
<i>Thank you, Carol. Hallelujah.</i>

1063
01:00:06,083 --> 01:00:09,352
<i>I'll go ahead and let him know. I'm sure
he'll look forward to hearin' your story.</i>

1064
01:00:09,353 --> 01:00:12,423
- <i>Good night.</i>
- Oh, good night.

1065
01:00:38,115 --> 01:00:40,384
Poon-Yen, hi.

1066
01:00:40,385 --> 01:00:43,087
We realize your time is precious,

1067
01:00:43,088 --> 01:00:45,256
so we're gonna get
straight to the business.

1068
01:00:45,257 --> 01:00:48,091
My business partner's
right here. Don Verdean.

1069
01:00:48,092 --> 01:00:49,993
Pleasure to meet ya, Poon-Yen.

1070
01:00:49,994 --> 01:00:52,430
Hello, Don. I'm a big fan of your work.

1071
01:00:52,431 --> 01:00:55,466
- I have all your DVD.
- Thank you.

1072
01:00:55,467 --> 01:00:58,169
Uh, Don is going to
brief you on what he knows

1073
01:00:58,170 --> 01:01:00,671
about the location of the Holy Grail.

1074
01:01:00,672 --> 01:01:03,473
Uh, many people believe the Grail is buried

1075
01:01:03,474 --> 01:01:05,676
on a booby-trapped
island off of Nova Scotia.

1076
01:01:05,677 --> 01:01:09,113
<i>Even Franklin D. Roosevelt
blew a significant load of cash</i>

1077
01:01:09,114 --> 01:01:12,149
tryin' to find it there, but the
Knights Templar were tricky fellows.

1078
01:01:12,150 --> 01:01:15,419
Oh, yes, those... those damn bastards.

1079
01:01:15,420 --> 01:01:17,754
But based on my study of
the Kensington Runestone,

1080
01:01:17,755 --> 01:01:20,357
I believe I have a mountain of evidence

1081
01:01:20,358 --> 01:01:24,694
<i>that places the Grail on an Indian
reservation in the American Southwest.</i>

1082
01:01:24,695 --> 01:01:28,901
Oh, that's very interesting!
Which Indian reservation is it?

1083
01:01:30,402 --> 01:01:33,303
Of course, that information is confidential

1084
01:01:33,304 --> 01:01:35,772
until we've formally
entered into an agreement.

1085
01:01:35,773 --> 01:01:37,707
That's right. Don's right.

1086
01:01:37,708 --> 01:01:40,578
We're going to need a
substantial retainer fee

1087
01:01:40,579 --> 01:01:44,314
um, before we can begin. For our services.

1088
01:01:44,315 --> 01:01:47,484
Oh, uh, how much of my money do you want?

1089
01:01:47,485 --> 01:01:50,388
Um, a million dollars sound okay?

1090
01:01:53,157 --> 01:01:57,194
- A million dollars sounds okay.
- Sure... certainly be a start.

1091
01:01:57,195 --> 01:01:59,696
So, when can we go look for the Grail?

1092
01:01:59,697 --> 01:02:02,332
Well, give us a few days
to organize our game plan

1093
01:02:02,333 --> 01:02:04,734
- and we'll call you.
- <i>Sound great!</i>

1094
01:02:04,735 --> 01:02:07,203
Uh, so how will you be paying us?

1095
01:02:07,204 --> 01:02:10,408
We've got a few urgent matters
we need to take care of.

1096
01:02:10,409 --> 01:02:13,743
Oh, when I fly out for the
dig, I will bring you cash.

1097
01:02:13,744 --> 01:02:17,348
Is there any way that you could

1098
01:02:17,349 --> 01:02:19,350
wire us the money right now?

1099
01:02:19,351 --> 01:02:22,118
Uh, maybe, I don't know, 10 grand to...

1100
01:02:22,119 --> 01:02:25,089
<i>to hold us over till then?</i>

1101
01:02:25,090 --> 01:02:26,524
I'm sorry. Can you say again?

1102
01:02:26,525 --> 01:02:28,792
I can't understand you say. What you say?

1103
01:02:28,793 --> 01:02:31,629
Oh, is there any way that you can wire us

1104
01:02:31,630 --> 01:02:34,631
the money straight away? Like,
say, maybe 10 grand maybe?

1105
01:02:34,632 --> 01:02:38,603
Your accent are very
strong. Can you say again?

1106
01:02:40,237 --> 01:02:43,207
Is there any way you can wire us the money

1107
01:02:43,208 --> 01:02:45,843
straight away, maybe? Just to tide us over.

1108
01:02:45,844 --> 01:02:48,479
Perhaps, about 10 grand?

1109
01:02:50,315 --> 01:02:53,750
Hey, no problem. I'll just, uh...
send me your bank account number.

1110
01:02:53,751 --> 01:02:57,587
Okay, thank you. We'll
do that straight away.

1111
01:02:57,588 --> 01:03:01,158
Okay, fantastic. Uh, goodbye, gentlemen.

1112
01:03:04,596 --> 01:03:07,865
And that is what I'm talking about.

1113
01:03:09,835 --> 01:03:13,104
Ooh, <i>shalom!</i>

1114
01:03:36,460 --> 01:03:38,828
Ah, good evening, Carol.

1115
01:03:38,829 --> 01:03:41,297
You're lookin' very nice.

1116
01:03:41,298 --> 01:03:44,267
Oh, Boaz.

1117
01:03:44,268 --> 01:03:46,703
I didn't know this was a formal event.

1118
01:03:46,704 --> 01:03:48,839
Just a little bit of light dancing

1119
01:03:48,840 --> 01:03:51,442
and maybe some cocktails for two.

1120
01:03:51,443 --> 01:03:53,843
I brought you an outfit.

1121
01:03:53,844 --> 01:03:57,382
Where we're going has a strict dress code.

1122
01:03:59,150 --> 01:04:02,019
Okay, I just need a minute.

1123
01:04:04,188 --> 01:04:05,455
Can I...

1124
01:04:13,697 --> 01:04:15,466
<i>Wow.</i>

1125
01:04:15,467 --> 01:04:17,803
You look great!

1126
01:04:19,304 --> 01:04:23,707
<i>♪ Come on, baby,
down to paradise ♪</i>

1127
01:04:23,708 --> 01:04:27,678
<i>♪ Tell some stories
over cheese and wine ♪</i>

1128
01:04:27,679 --> 01:04:32,584
<i>♪ I can see the sun goin'
down in your eyes... ♪</i>

1129
01:04:35,686 --> 01:04:39,489
So, Carol, I've been meaning
to ask you since I met you

1130
01:04:39,490 --> 01:04:42,292
what qualities are you
looking for in a mate?

1131
01:04:42,293 --> 01:04:45,196
Oh, um...

1132
01:04:45,197 --> 01:04:47,397
I'm sorry, Boaz,

1133
01:04:47,398 --> 01:04:52,368
I was under the impression you had
some questions about Jesus of Nazareth.

1134
01:04:52,369 --> 01:04:54,504
Oh, yeah.

1135
01:04:54,505 --> 01:04:57,241
What is it that you like about that guy?

1136
01:04:57,242 --> 01:04:59,843
Well, um...

1137
01:04:59,844 --> 01:05:03,546
he was kind, handsome,

1138
01:05:03,547 --> 01:05:05,316
merciful,

1139
01:05:05,317 --> 01:05:07,750
forgiving.

1140
01:05:07,751 --> 01:05:10,486
He's the perfect man.

1141
01:05:10,487 --> 01:05:14,693
So, I guess, that's what
I'm looking for in somebody.

1142
01:05:16,594 --> 01:05:18,328
Looks like your Lord and me

1143
01:05:18,329 --> 01:05:20,830
have a lot in common.

1144
01:05:20,831 --> 01:05:23,399
We grew up in the same neighborhood

1145
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:25,502
and we walked the same streets

1146
01:05:25,503 --> 01:05:28,207
under the same sunshine.

1147
01:05:29,740 --> 01:05:31,408
E-excuse me?

1148
01:05:31,409 --> 01:05:35,147
We're both Jewish guys.

1149
01:05:36,914 --> 01:05:39,017
Shall we dance?

1150
01:06:23,327 --> 01:06:25,296
So, Carol, tell me

1151
01:06:25,297 --> 01:06:26,596
do you want children?

1152
01:06:26,597 --> 01:06:28,598
Your hips say that

1153
01:06:28,599 --> 01:06:30,100
you can handle many.

1154
01:06:32,036 --> 01:06:36,173
Oh, well, your hips do spread
a little after childbirth.

1155
01:06:38,610 --> 01:06:42,214
- What?
- Oh, didn't Don tell you I have a son?

1156
01:06:43,614 --> 01:06:47,350
He's at the Wayne County
Correctional Facility.

1157
01:06:47,351 --> 01:06:49,352
Oh, he's in jail.

1158
01:06:49,353 --> 01:06:52,557
So I won't have to provide for him.

1159
01:06:54,525 --> 01:06:57,595
I don't want to provide for another's son.

1160
01:07:00,632 --> 01:07:01,999
Carol, wait!

1161
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,600
Don promised me a night with you!

1162
01:07:04,601 --> 01:07:07,604
Don't go! He promised me!

1163
01:07:07,605 --> 01:07:09,038
Please!

1164
01:07:09,039 --> 01:07:14,046
<i>♪ I'm here with you ♪</i>

1165
01:07:15,646 --> 01:07:20,751
<i>♪ I'm here with you... ♪</i>

1166
01:07:28,827 --> 01:07:30,761
<i>Carol, what on Earth
happened to you?</i>

1167
01:07:30,762 --> 01:07:32,730
Are you all right?

1168
01:07:32,731 --> 01:07:35,531
Oh, well, I see my pimp has
finally decided to check up on me.

1169
01:07:35,532 --> 01:07:37,500
What are you talking about?

1170
01:07:37,501 --> 01:07:39,837
You know what I'm talkin' about!

1171
01:07:39,838 --> 01:07:42,973
One night with Boaz?!

1172
01:07:42,974 --> 01:07:46,144
I'm no Potiphar's wife!

1173
01:07:47,077 --> 01:07:50,480
I am so sorry, Carol. I-I...

1174
01:07:50,481 --> 01:07:53,384
he just said he wanted
to get to know you better.

1175
01:07:53,385 --> 01:07:56,754
- <i>Did he hurt you?</i>
- You know, Don, I think it's time you find yourself

1176
01:07:56,755 --> 01:07:58,624
a new research assistant.

1177
01:08:17,908 --> 01:08:20,810
You are a really great dancer.

1178
01:08:20,811 --> 01:08:22,847
Aah!

1179
01:08:28,019 --> 01:08:30,053
Ow!

1180
01:08:30,054 --> 01:08:32,989
<i>Ow!</i>

1181
01:08:32,990 --> 01:08:34,793
<i>Don!</i>

1182
01:08:45,703 --> 01:08:47,739
Ooh!

1183
01:08:52,143 --> 01:08:54,311
We've got a major problem.

1184
01:08:56,547 --> 01:08:59,983
<i>I hate this guy, man. This
lab tech guy, I hate this guy.</i>

1185
01:08:59,984 --> 01:09:02,118
- <i>He's a "dootchbag".</i>
- <i>What'd he say?</i>

1186
01:09:02,119 --> 01:09:04,487
He says that the press
have been hounding him

1187
01:09:04,488 --> 01:09:07,858
and hounding him and unless
he sees some money today...

1188
01:09:07,859 --> 01:09:09,792
- he wants it in cash.
- Wait a minute.

1189
01:09:09,793 --> 01:09:12,496
- You haven't paid him yet?!
- I haven't paid him because...

1190
01:09:12,497 --> 01:09:14,965
- Oh!
- Poon-Yen hasn't paid me yet. Okay?

1191
01:09:14,966 --> 01:09:17,667
So don't blame me, Don. Don't put it on me.

1192
01:09:17,668 --> 01:09:19,635
How am I supposed to bring the money?

1193
01:09:19,636 --> 01:09:21,806
Produce it from my anus?

1194
01:09:37,055 --> 01:09:39,188
<i>I understand we owe you some money.</i>

1195
01:09:39,189 --> 01:09:40,924
Hell, yeah, you do.

1196
01:09:40,925 --> 01:09:42,658
Well, we apologize for the delay,

1197
01:09:42,659 --> 01:09:44,995
our money's been tied up
in an offshore account,

1198
01:09:44,996 --> 01:09:47,230
but if you give us another day
or two we'll double your offer

1199
01:09:47,231 --> 01:09:49,166
<i>maybe even throw in a bucket
of chicken or somethin'.</i>

1200
01:09:49,167 --> 01:09:51,234
I need cash now.

1201
01:09:51,235 --> 01:09:53,603
<i>That was the deal.</i>

1202
01:09:53,604 --> 01:09:55,072
If you can't make that happen,

1203
01:09:55,073 --> 01:09:57,174
I'll send everyone the real results.

1204
01:09:57,175 --> 01:09:59,710
- It's that simple.
- <i>We... we understand.</i>

1205
01:09:59,711 --> 01:10:02,211
Okay, drop the phone.

1206
01:10:02,212 --> 01:10:04,947
- <i>Oh, whoa. Boaz! What are you doing?</i>
- <i>Put the phone down.</i>

1207
01:10:04,948 --> 01:10:06,683
<i>Do you think I'm
fooling around, creep?</i>

1208
01:10:06,684 --> 01:10:09,219
I said drop the phone!

1209
01:10:09,220 --> 01:10:11,087
<i>Boaz, put the gun down.</i>

1210
01:10:11,088 --> 01:10:12,822
Please.

1211
01:10:12,823 --> 01:10:14,558
Oh, my Lord.

1212
01:10:22,699 --> 01:10:25,436
Get into the car.

1213
01:10:28,038 --> 01:10:29,773
<i>Come on, get in the
trunk of the car.</i>

1214
01:10:29,774 --> 01:10:31,841
<i>Get in the Fiero!</i>

1215
01:10:31,842 --> 01:10:35,046
Just... see if you can fit in there.

1216
01:10:38,048 --> 01:10:40,983
- Don, help get these...
- No! I'm not helpin' you do nothin'!

1217
01:10:40,984 --> 01:10:42,885
Tuck your knees together, maybe.

1218
01:10:42,886 --> 01:10:44,554
<i>You're gonna crush his skull.</i>

1219
01:10:44,555 --> 01:10:45,855
<i>He's not gonna fit in there.</i>

1220
01:10:45,856 --> 01:10:47,525
Put that gun away!

1221
01:10:48,993 --> 01:10:51,795
Listen to me now, Boaz,
this just got real serious.

1222
01:10:51,796 --> 01:10:55,267
You better tell me right now
what you plan to do with this guy.

1223
01:11:07,878 --> 01:11:09,612
Make yourself comfortable.

1224
01:11:09,613 --> 01:11:12,014
If you promise to stay
put for the next few days,

1225
01:11:12,015 --> 01:11:13,817
you'll get 50 grand

1226
01:11:13,818 --> 01:11:16,319
and we can all pretend
like this never happened.

1227
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:18,489
- Understand?
- Yeah, sure.

1228
01:11:23,694 --> 01:11:26,830
<i>As I surveyed the landscape</i>

1229
01:11:26,831 --> 01:11:29,131
<i>with our expedition
team, a large monolith</i>

1230
01:11:29,132 --> 01:11:32,269
caught my attention,
and somethin' inside me

1231
01:11:32,270 --> 01:11:34,904
just knew that's where
we had to start digging.

1232
01:11:34,905 --> 01:11:38,341
So, following my lead, that
is precisely what we did.

1233
01:11:38,342 --> 01:11:43,045
And within minutes, we unearthed the skull.

1234
01:11:43,046 --> 01:11:45,916
It must have been the hand of
the Lord that guided us that day.

1235
01:11:45,917 --> 01:11:48,919
I don't know how else to explain it.

1236
01:11:48,920 --> 01:11:51,923
I understand you've parted
ways with Don Verdean.

1237
01:11:53,992 --> 01:11:56,792
Would you mind explaining
what happened, exactly?

1238
01:11:56,793 --> 01:11:59,062
<i>Well, after a while, some people</i>

1239
01:11:59,063 --> 01:12:01,898
start to chase money, I suppose.

1240
01:12:01,899 --> 01:12:04,667
But I am here to promote the faith.

1241
01:12:04,668 --> 01:12:09,139
Are you suggesting Don Verdean
made a pact with Lucifer, then?

1242
01:12:09,140 --> 01:12:13,143
Uh, no, no. No, Don is
an honest, gentle man.

1243
01:12:13,144 --> 01:12:15,312
<i>He would never side
with The Dark One.</i>

1244
01:12:15,313 --> 01:12:18,516
Not even if it were to
help him find the Grail?

How stupid is this Poon-Yen guy?

1275
01:14:11,796 --> 01:14:14,864
<i>We are now inviting those
passengers with small children</i>

1276
01:14:14,865 --> 01:14:17,200
<i>and any passengers
requiring special assistance</i>

1277
01:14:17,201 --> 01:14:19,435
<i>to begin boarding at this time.</i>

1278
01:14:19,436 --> 01:14:22,938
<i>Please have your boarding
pass and identification ready.</i>

1279
01:14:22,939 --> 01:14:26,843
<i>Regular boarding will begin in
approximately 10 minutes. Thank you.</i>

1280
01:14:26,844 --> 01:14:28,844
<i>Ni hao ma.</i>

1281
01:14:28,845 --> 01:14:30,346
How was your flight from the Orient, sir?

1282
01:14:30,347 --> 01:14:33,250
It was fine. When do
we leave for the Grail?

1283
01:14:33,251 --> 01:14:34,951
In 25 minutes.

1284
01:14:34,952 --> 01:14:36,219
We chartered a helicopter to take us

1285
01:14:36,220 --> 01:14:39,255
deep inside the Indian reservation.

1286
01:14:39,256 --> 01:14:41,957
They'll set us down about one
click south of the Templar cave.

1287
01:14:41,958 --> 01:14:43,960
Now, after that, we'll
have under three hours

1288
01:14:43,961 --> 01:14:46,129
to penetrate the cave, locate the Grail,

1289
01:14:46,130 --> 01:14:48,230
and rendezvous back at
our extraction point.

1290
01:14:48,231 --> 01:14:49,832
You're gonna need to wear this.

1291
01:14:49,833 --> 01:14:53,303
The cave is guarded 24/7
by Native American warriors,

1292
01:14:53,304 --> 01:14:55,438
we don't wanna take any chances.

1293
01:14:55,439 --> 01:14:57,375
All right, let's roll in!

1294
01:15:07,385 --> 01:15:10,386
<i>I got five helicopters
just like this at home.</i>

1295
01:15:10,387 --> 01:15:14,124
<i>I replaced all the engine
with Rolls Royce engine.</i>

1296
01:15:14,125 --> 01:15:16,327
<i>That... that's great, Poon-Yen.</i>

1297
01:15:51,863 --> 01:15:53,996
Okay, so our latest intel

1298
01:15:53,997 --> 01:15:57,166
says that the guards
work in 12-hour shifts.

1299
01:15:57,167 --> 01:16:00,336
It takes them 15 minutes to
ride the horse out of the canyon

1300
01:16:00,337 --> 01:16:04,006
<i>and another 15 for the
replacement guard to ride back.</i>

1301
01:16:04,007 --> 01:16:07,376
By my calculations we
got a 30 minute window

1302
01:16:07,377 --> 01:16:09,713
in which to fetch the Grail.

1303
01:16:20,557 --> 01:16:22,860
Okay, now's our chance. Let's move.

1304
01:16:26,130 --> 01:16:28,230
I can't believe we're
so close to the Grail.

1305
01:16:28,231 --> 01:16:30,332
I can feel its power inside me!

1306
01:16:30,333 --> 01:16:32,403
Well, hopefully, we can all get a cell.

1307
01:16:49,487 --> 01:16:51,289
All right.

1308
01:16:53,090 --> 01:16:55,693
Better get them lanterns
on. We haven't much time.

1309
01:17:06,069 --> 01:17:08,872
All right. Let's sally forth.

1310
01:17:27,958 --> 01:17:30,961
- Maybe we should pray.
- You bet.

1311
01:17:30,962 --> 01:17:32,728
<i>That's a great idea. Um...</i>

1312
01:17:32,729 --> 01:17:35,230
Why don't you take the lead on this one?

1313
01:17:35,231 --> 01:17:37,233
Okay.

1314
01:17:37,234 --> 01:17:39,234
Dear Lord,

1315
01:17:39,235 --> 01:17:43,372
please guide us safely to
Your Holy Grail of wonders.

1316
01:17:43,373 --> 01:17:45,407
We promise to take good care of it.

1317
01:17:45,408 --> 01:17:47,577
Amen.

1318
01:17:47,578 --> 01:17:49,478
- Amen. That was good.
- Amen.

1319
01:17:49,479 --> 01:17:52,482
How you feelin'? We should get
that... you wanna power through?

1320
01:17:54,618 --> 01:17:56,553
I feel that God is on our side.

1321
01:17:56,554 --> 01:17:59,356
Well, let's sally forth, then.

1322
01:18:46,337 --> 01:18:48,806
Poon-Yen, this is all you, buddy.

1323
01:19:15,432 --> 01:19:17,869
It's more beautiful than I ever imagined.

1324
01:19:19,603 --> 01:19:22,505
And to think that the lips of your Lord

1325
01:19:22,506 --> 01:19:24,676
graced this very cup.

1326
01:19:26,109 --> 01:19:28,546
Plenty of time to examine
it later. Put it in here.

1327
01:19:30,814 --> 01:19:32,514
Let's roll.

1328
01:19:32,515 --> 01:19:34,452
<i>Come on. Let's go!</i>

1329
01:19:43,726 --> 01:19:46,530
Head for the safety of the trees!

1330
01:19:51,202 --> 01:19:52,801
They're shooting!

1331
01:19:52,802 --> 01:19:55,638
Hurry! Hurry!

1332
01:19:55,639 --> 01:19:57,107
Get down! Get down!

1333
01:19:58,809 --> 01:20:02,013
<i>The Indian guys.
They're shooting at us!</i>

1334
01:20:03,314 --> 01:20:05,281
Do they know we have the Grail?

1335
01:20:05,282 --> 01:20:07,183
I think we're trapped.

1336
01:20:07,184 --> 01:20:08,818
<i>What should we do?</i>

1337
01:20:08,819 --> 01:20:10,586
<i>They won't stop shooting!</i>

1338
01:20:13,690 --> 01:20:15,457
- I've been hit.
- Oh, no! Oh, no!

1339
01:20:15,458 --> 01:20:17,559
Ow!

1340
01:20:17,560 --> 01:20:19,261
- Oh, my God!
- It's bad.

1341
01:20:19,262 --> 01:20:21,363
They must have hit an artery.

1342
01:20:21,364 --> 01:20:23,832
- It's okay.
- I need a tourniquet or a bandage or...

1343
01:20:23,833 --> 01:20:26,803
- tissue paper, anything!
- I'm sorry, Boaz,

1344
01:20:26,804 --> 01:20:29,839
I-I-I think this will take
nothing short of a miracle.

1345
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:32,175
Oh! What about the Holy Grail?!

1346
01:20:32,176 --> 01:20:35,444
Poon-Yen, fill the Grail with water.

1347
01:20:35,445 --> 01:20:38,413
It contains the secret of eternal life.

1348
01:20:38,414 --> 01:20:40,517
- I'll go fill 'er up.
- Stay calm.

1349
01:20:40,518 --> 01:20:41,985
Just breathe.

1350
01:20:44,488 --> 01:20:45,854
He's bleeding really bad.

1351
01:20:45,855 --> 01:20:48,224
It hurts!

1352
01:20:48,225 --> 01:20:49,858
Just focus on God.

1353
01:20:55,332 --> 01:20:58,167
Hold still. This could hurt.

1354
01:21:02,206 --> 01:21:04,874
<i>It's working!</i>

1355
01:21:04,875 --> 01:21:06,878
Praise the Lord!

1356
01:21:08,212 --> 01:21:11,947
I don't believe it because that...

1357
01:21:11,948 --> 01:21:15,586
I was in pain and now it's all healed.

1358
01:21:17,688 --> 01:21:19,755
It really is the Holy Grail!

1359
01:21:19,756 --> 01:21:22,959
- <i>Hallelujah.</i>
- All right, let's go.

1360
01:21:24,694 --> 01:21:27,796
Yeah, I think we still may have
time to make the rendezvous.

1361
01:21:32,435 --> 01:21:33,903
Poon-Yen!

1362
01:21:33,904 --> 01:21:36,339
<i>Hey! Cease fire! Cease fire!</i>

1363
01:21:36,340 --> 01:21:38,273
I thought you told them to use blanks!

1364
01:21:38,274 --> 01:21:40,777
They didn't have any blanks, I
told them to fire above our heads.

1365
01:21:40,778 --> 01:21:44,546
Poon-Yen!

1366
01:21:44,547 --> 01:21:47,450
<i>Dr. Odain, you're
needed in Oncology.</i>

1367
01:21:47,451 --> 01:21:49,720
<i>Dr. Odain in Oncology.</i>

1368
01:21:52,722 --> 01:21:54,091
What did you tell them?

1369
01:21:55,391 --> 01:21:57,694
I told them it was a hunting accident.

1370
01:21:59,829 --> 01:22:02,497
I wish that guy would
just hand over our money.

1371
01:22:02,498 --> 01:22:04,500
We gave them the Grail,
what more do they want?

1372
01:22:04,501 --> 01:22:06,803
- Shut up, Boaz.
- He can't understand me.

1373
01:22:06,804 --> 01:22:08,537
<i>Can't speak English.</i>

1374
01:22:08,538 --> 01:22:11,707
I should just stick him up
right now and done with it.

1375
01:22:11,708 --> 01:22:13,475
Listen here, Boaz.

1376
01:22:13,476 --> 01:22:16,612
You easily the stupidest man I've ever met.

1377
01:22:16,613 --> 01:22:20,683
<i>Bringing you out here was the biggest
damn mistake of my entire life.</i>

1378
01:22:20,684 --> 01:22:23,653
As soon as we pay off that
lab tech, you and I are done.

1379
01:22:23,654 --> 01:22:26,421
I don't ever wanna see or hear from you

1380
01:22:26,422 --> 01:22:29,025
ever again. You understand me?

1381
01:22:36,567 --> 01:22:39,001
Let's just call it quits
right now, then. Shall we?

1382
01:22:39,002 --> 01:22:41,304
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Don't do this.

1383
01:22:41,305 --> 01:22:43,038
<i>Hold on, now.</i>

1384
01:22:43,039 --> 01:22:44,974
<i>Don't do this, Boaz.</i>

1385
01:22:44,975 --> 01:22:47,044
<i>Come on!</i>

1386
01:22:48,545 --> 01:22:51,147
Good riddance, Don,
you washed up, old hack.

1387
01:22:54,818 --> 01:22:57,687
Stay here.

1388
01:22:57,688 --> 01:23:00,590
<i>Security wanted in
the parking lot three.</i>

1389
01:23:20,877 --> 01:23:22,911
- Give me the case.
- No!

1390
01:23:22,912 --> 01:23:25,947
- Give me the case!
- No, Don, no!

1391
01:23:33,823 --> 01:23:35,693
Open it up.

1392
01:23:53,042 --> 01:23:56,645
<i>Chang, it's me, Fontaine.</i>

1393
01:23:56,646 --> 01:23:58,547
<i>You're not gonna believe this,
but the Sherriff's department</i>

1394
01:23:58,548 --> 01:24:01,416
<i>just found the lab guy
locked up in a storage unit.</i>

1395
01:24:01,417 --> 01:24:03,618
<i>The GPS I stuck on their
car led 'em right to him.</i>

1396
01:24:03,619 --> 01:24:05,688
<i>So, I-I'm with the police.</i>

1397
01:24:05,689 --> 01:24:07,790
<i>We're waiting for some backup
and then we'll be right over.</i>

1398
01:24:07,791 --> 01:24:09,892
<i>Thank you so much for
your help with this.</i>

1399
01:24:09,893 --> 01:24:11,829
<i>We got 'em.</i>

1400
01:24:13,596 --> 01:24:16,167
We were set up.

1401
01:24:18,735 --> 01:24:21,670
We were set up!

1402
01:24:21,671 --> 01:24:24,639
<i>Poon-Yen was working for
Fontaine this whole time,</i>

1403
01:24:24,640 --> 01:24:26,675
<i>and his name is Chang!</i>

1404
01:24:26,676 --> 01:24:29,879
He doesn't have a billion dollars.

1405
01:24:39,622 --> 01:24:41,157
They've been tracking us!

1406
01:24:47,564 --> 01:24:49,431
You better hit the road, buddy.

1407
01:24:49,432 --> 01:24:51,533
What about you? Where are you gonna go?

1408
01:24:51,534 --> 01:24:53,870
It's better if we split up.

1409
01:25:10,186 --> 01:25:13,790
Stupid bastard. Stupid, greedy bastard!

1410
01:25:16,126 --> 01:25:18,796
<i>Ah, that's him! Go, go, go, go!</i>

1411
01:25:19,997 --> 01:25:21,930
Oh, man.

1412
01:25:21,931 --> 01:25:23,733
Oh, no!

1413
01:25:23,734 --> 01:25:26,068
How do you do this? Is there a button or...

1414
01:25:26,069 --> 01:25:28,004
Hello? Somebody?

1415
01:25:28,005 --> 01:25:30,872
I'm in a-a police car
and we need a spike strip.

1416
01:25:30,873 --> 01:25:32,809
<i>Get me snipers, get me SWAT.</i>

1417
01:25:32,810 --> 01:25:35,545
<i>I want to set up a roadblock
from Kern to Hawthorne.</i>

1418
01:25:35,546 --> 01:25:37,078
Can't you ram them or something?

1419
01:25:37,079 --> 01:25:39,881
Let's see if you pigs can beat a Pontiac.

1420
01:25:42,019 --> 01:25:43,687
<i>Main Street! They're on Main Street!</i>

1421
01:25:46,189 --> 01:25:48,825
<i>We're only going 35?!
Come on, step on it!</i>

1422
01:25:48,826 --> 01:25:51,028
<i>Do a pit maneuver or something!</i>

1423
01:25:54,765 --> 01:25:56,898
<i>Oh, man. Oh, no.</i>

1424
01:26:03,841 --> 01:26:06,142
- Don't shoot!
- <i>Get your hands up!</i>

1425
01:26:06,143 --> 01:26:07,876
- <i>Get your hands above your head!</i>
- Don't shoot.

1426
01:26:07,877 --> 01:26:09,511
- Get over here!
- <i>We got him!</i>

1427
01:26:11,081 --> 01:26:12,814
You have the right to remain silent.

1428
01:26:12,815 --> 01:26:14,850
- Anything you say...
- That's enough, buddy.

1429
01:26:14,851 --> 01:26:16,919
...can be held against you. Okay.

1430
01:26:16,920 --> 01:26:19,688
You are done, man. You
and Verdean are done!

1431
01:26:19,689 --> 01:26:22,058
Tony Lazarus's church is crap!

1432
01:26:22,059 --> 01:26:25,060
- Huh? How does it feel?
- It feels great, man.

1433
01:26:25,061 --> 01:26:26,528
Yeah, I'm sure it does.

1434
01:26:26,529 --> 01:26:28,531
You had a hand in taking it down.

1435
01:26:28,532 --> 01:26:32,068
A huge hand, and I give
you a hand for that.

1436
01:26:32,069 --> 01:26:33,838
Get him out of here. Get him to jail.

1437
01:26:38,207 --> 01:26:40,076
Yeah!

1438
01:26:40,077 --> 01:26:41,745
Whoo!

1439
01:26:51,654 --> 01:26:53,855

I'm a charlatan.

1445
01:27:06,235 --> 01:27:09,538
- I don't understand.
- I stole the Goliath skull

1446
01:27:09,539 --> 01:27:12,675
from a grave in Jerusalem...

1447
01:27:12,676 --> 01:27:14,844

How long have you been doin' this?

1451
01:27:22,552 --> 01:27:24,219

the recently foreclosed on
Friendship Harvest Temple

1468
01:28:19,208 --> 01:28:22,010
where Pastor Fontaine is
accused of... there he is now!

1469
01:28:22,011 --> 01:28:23,645
- Not today. Get that thing out of my face.
- Pastor Fontaine,

1470
01:28:23,646 --> 01:28:25,781
what do you have to say about the misuse...

1471
01:28:25,782 --> 01:28:27,983
- You don't know what you're talking about.
- ...of church funds

1472
01:28:27,984 --> 01:28:31,153
- to hire local restaurateur Chang...
- Don Verdean is the fraud.

1473
01:28:31,154 --> 01:28:33,255
- Not me and that's all I have to say.
- Your actions were in fact

1474
01:28:33,256 --> 01:28:35,056
- fraudulent...
- This interview is done!

1475
01:28:35,057 --> 01:28:37,528
- ...even un-Christian!
- Done!

1476
01:28:39,128 --> 01:28:41,697
<i>Reverend Lazarus, what
has this been like for you</i>

1477
01:28:41,698 --> 01:28:44,200
and for your flock since
Mr. Verdean was convicted

1478
01:28:44,201 --> 01:28:46,135
of fraud, larceny,

1479
01:28:46,136 --> 01:28:49,138
aggravated assault, and
accessory to kidnapping?

1480
01:28:49,139 --> 01:28:50,805
Well, as you can imagine,

1481
01:28:50,806 --> 01:28:53,341
it has been very, very difficult.

1482
01:28:53,342 --> 01:28:54,943
It's been tough times.

1483
01:28:54,944 --> 01:28:56,978
Tough for my marriage,

1484
01:28:56,979 --> 01:28:59,114
tough for my members,

1485
01:28:59,115 --> 01:29:00,750
tough for my very faith.

1486
01:29:00,751 --> 01:29:03,653
But I do believe that Don Verdean

1487
01:29:03,654 --> 01:29:05,121
has a good heart,

1488
01:29:05,122 --> 01:29:07,355
and I believe his heart
was in the right place.

1489
01:29:07,356 --> 01:29:09,224
So, Don,

1490
01:29:09,225 --> 01:29:10,859
I forgive you.

1491
01:29:10,860 --> 01:29:12,827
And if you are watchin' this,

1492
01:29:12,828 --> 01:29:15,831
I think the Lord forgives you, too.

1493
01:29:15,832 --> 01:29:17,265
Amen.

1494
01:29:24,073 --> 01:29:25,541
Let's go.

1495
01:29:39,722 --> 01:29:41,190
Whoo.

1496
01:29:42,859 --> 01:29:44,662
So, have you joined a gang yet?

1497
01:29:46,128 --> 01:29:49,732
Gotta join a gang, Don, I'm telling you.

1498
01:29:49,733 --> 01:29:51,800
I'm in the Jewish Brotherhood

1499
01:29:51,801 --> 01:29:53,803
with Todd Katzenberg.

1500
01:29:53,804 --> 01:29:55,904
Todd's a tough guy, man.

1501
01:29:55,905 --> 01:29:57,773
A good accountant, too.

1502
01:29:57,774 --> 01:30:01,176
We're called the "He-bros."

1503
01:30:01,177 --> 01:30:03,312
I can get you in...

1504
01:30:03,313 --> 01:30:06,782
but we might have to jump you first.

1505
01:30:06,783 --> 01:30:09,719
No, thank you, Boaz, I'm doin' all right.

1506
01:30:09,720 --> 01:30:11,853
Okay.

1507
01:30:11,854 --> 01:30:14,190
I made you something.

1508
01:30:19,762 --> 01:30:21,496
Check it out.

1509
01:30:21,497 --> 01:30:24,767
It's a toothbrush/shiv.

1510
01:30:24,768 --> 01:30:26,801
This part can brush your teeth,

1511
01:30:26,802 --> 01:30:28,304
this part is a knife.

1512
01:30:28,305 --> 01:30:31,308
Brush, stab. Brush, stab.

1513
01:30:32,743 --> 01:30:35,778
Take it, Don, I made this one for you.

1514
01:30:35,779 --> 01:30:38,246
It's okay, I've got another
one in my butt crack.

1515
01:30:38,247 --> 01:30:40,184
No, thank you.

1516
01:30:45,255 --> 01:30:47,389
Anytime,

1517
01:30:47,390 --> 01:30:48,991
anywhere,

1518
01:30:48,992 --> 01:30:50,826
any place.

1519
01:30:50,827 --> 01:30:53,297
I'll be here to protect you.

1520
01:30:56,932 --> 01:30:58,466
<i>Shalom.</i>

1521
01:30:58,467 --> 01:31:00,303
<i>Shalom.</i>

1522
01:31:44,980 --> 01:31:46,716
Mind if I sit down?

1523
01:31:51,087 --> 01:31:52,656
My name's Don.

1524
01:31:55,524 --> 01:31:57,193
Hey.

1525
01:32:00,963 --> 01:32:03,132
Your mother named Carol?

1526
01:32:05,969 --> 01:32:09,506
- Yeah.
- I know your mother, son.
