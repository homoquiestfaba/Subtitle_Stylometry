1
00:00:13,561 --> 00:00:16,515
KING SOLOMON'S MINES

2
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:34,788
Where are my elephants?

3
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,600
We are searching for hours ...

4
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,400
I have not seen one!

5
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:40,100
I won't go back all empty-handed,

6
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:41,700
Mr. Mc Nabb!

7
00:00:43,257 --> 00:00:44,932
they are the

8
00:00:44,576 --> 00:00:47,363
see: mostly females...

9
00:00:47,837 --> 00:00:49,943
Females, not much ivory.

10
00:00:51,182 --> 00:00:55,002
who cares... I not mind to shoot.

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,900
all right- I got you covered...

12
00:01:06,339 --> 00:01:08,513
just Take it nice and easy.

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:16,822
No!

14
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:18,263
Mr. Bitter.

15
00:01:18,643 --> 00:01:21,961
No  animal is to be dropped,
unless I say so.

16
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:24,984
This is my safari, Mr. Quatermain.

17
00:01:25,133 --> 00:01:27,800
I promised you one full grown male.

18
00:01:27,836 --> 00:01:29,644
And that is what you will get Sir!

19
00:01:30,639 --> 00:01:31,884
Allan.

20
00:01:32,391 --> 00:01:33,971
sir I am sorry sir

21
00:01:34,051 --> 00:01:38,379
I did not travel thousands of kilometers
for one measly elephant.

22
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:40,683
- I care for it, sir.
- yea

23
00:01:44,236 --> 00:01:45,565
What are you doing?

24
00:01:45,863 --> 00:01:48,386
I need this job.
He is used to get it what he wants.

25
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,568
It's not my problem.

26
00:01:50,076 --> 00:01:53,000
If we don't make him happy,
he just hires other guide!

27
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:55,900
there is not shooting females and kids,
when he is with me.

28
00:01:55,581 --> 00:01:58,455
If more and more of this kind coming here,
we could be rich.

29
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,947
You can be rich- I can be rich.
you can Take proper care of your son!

30
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,752
don't you dare...

31
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:04,425
We got a contract, McNabb!

32
00:02:04,491 --> 00:02:07,600
I Kill as many of the filthy beasts
as I like

33
00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:09,674
- you get your kill, sir.

34
00:02:09,674 --> 00:02:11,274
- not With me, you woun't ...

35
00:02:12,974 --> 00:02:14,472
you go ahead, shoot.

36
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:28,807
no ... Noo!

37
00:02:50,138 --> 00:02:51,517
he's ok with...

38
00:02:52,598 --> 00:02:55,500
- You're ok?

39
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:57,055
I'm not.

40
00:02:57,637 --> 00:03:02,266
Well, it was not bad hunt
for the first day, what you think?

41
00:03:03,426 --> 00:03:04,824
No- Not bad.

42
00:03:04,953 --> 00:03:06,398
Mr. Bitter,

43
00:03:06,697 --> 00:03:11,300
a wounded elephant is the most
dangerous animal in the bush.

44
00:03:11,877 --> 00:03:13,436
This mother

45
00:03:13,503 --> 00:03:17,600
she is big, powerful
and she is very smart

46
00:03:18,734 --> 00:03:22,933
-She knows exactly who it is who shot her.
- Oh really?

47
00:03:23,138 --> 00:03:23,817
Really...

48
00:03:24,715 --> 00:03:25,891
- is that so?

49
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:30,000
but she is probably be followed by
a pack of lions or hyenas by now.

50
00:03:29,803 --> 00:03:30,918
good...

51
00:03:36,143 --> 00:03:37,472
oh rabbish...

52
00:03:58,749 --> 00:03:59,864
McNabb!

53
00:04:02,946 --> 00:04:04,191
Quatermain!

54
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:10,751
hello...

55
00:04:19,938 --> 00:04:21,183
duck!

56
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:42,182
cut me loose ... now!

57
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:08,018
Come on.

58
00:05:12,242 --> 00:05:13,653
That's right...

59
00:05:59,983 --> 00:06:01,441
Sorry, cully...

60
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:53,326
My dearest Elizabeth, at long last,
my seemingly endless quest

61
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:56,288
to unlock the mystery of King Solomon's Mines

62
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:58,249
is almost over...

63
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:02,121
I must also report
with a certain restraint

64
00:07:02,297 --> 00:07:04,943
while I'm as close to the mine
as I have ever been

65
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:09,294
there are outside forces that could
prevent me from reaching my goal,

66
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:11,718
momentarily I'm sure...

67
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:14,891
It has come to my attention
that my wealthy benefactors

68
00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:16,896
and the local Kuakuani tribes

69
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,526
are in some sort of competition

70
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,537
to plunder
the riches of Africa

71
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:26,853
it has become depressingly apparent
that  you're the only one I can still trust.

72
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:29,983
I am sending ytou this map
for safekeeping

73
00:07:30,159 --> 00:07:33,575
this is a tremendous value and
must be guarded with great care.

74
00:07:33,746 --> 00:07:37,494
It is my hope that I can protect you
from the dangers that I have found.

75
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:40,007
But in the event that you should
needed protection

76
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:42,415
I urgent to look up
Allan Quatermain.

77
00:07:43,589 --> 00:07:45,582
He is a man of great honor.

78
00:07:46,584 --> 00:07:48,392
Please keep  this map
from harms away

79
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,135
and perhaps we can keep
the mine safe

80
00:07:50,305 --> 00:07:53,306
from those who would tarnish
this legend forever.

81
00:07:53,292 --> 00:07:55,465
Your loving father.

82
00:08:21,895 --> 00:08:22,974
Binto

83
00:08:23,981 --> 00:08:25,226
Take this.

84
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:27,688
run as fast as you can
and stop for no one...

85
00:09:12,606 --> 00:09:13,769
Quatermain,

86
00:09:14,316 --> 00:09:16,190
Africa shines on you

87
00:09:16,427 --> 00:09:19,700
you should not blame this land
for your bad luck.

88
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:23,400
Khiva, I am not blaming Africa for anything

89
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:24,939
there has nothing to do with it
with bad luck.

90
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:27,899
partners stabbing me in
the back in my...

91
00:09:28,571 --> 00:09:30,149
my wife ...

92
00:09:37,966 --> 00:09:40,987
I have a son in England
who I belive needs the father.

93
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,667
And it's about time I become one

94
00:09:43,238 --> 00:09:46,588
You do not belong in England,
You belong are here with us.

95
00:09:46,358 --> 00:09:50,579
Yea Africa won't be the same
without you

96
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,972
Africa is will be the same
wether I am here or not

97
00:10:25,665 --> 00:10:26,810
Who you are?

98
00:10:29,027 --> 00:10:33,428
I am Twala. King of this land
and all what you see.

99
00:10:33,056 --> 00:10:36,748
Oh, you speak english?

100
00:10:36,668 --> 00:10:38,844
I know the language
of the white man.

101
00:10:39,588 --> 00:10:41,615
But why did you bring me here?

102
00:10:41,815 --> 00:10:44,484
do you have a map
thad leads to a key?

103
00:10:45,352 --> 00:10:46,697
I want that key.

104
00:10:48,922 --> 00:10:51,449
I have not the slightest idea
what you're talking about.

105
00:10:57,406 --> 00:10:58,283
Kill him.

106
00:11:01,268 --> 00:11:04,093
Now? ...  wait.

107
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:07,206
Yes, I ... I ... I found

108
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,243
I found a map and may had mentioned...

109
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,537
something about a key. But it,s long gone
I sent across ...

110
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:15,633
the great ocean, to my
daughter in England.

111
00:11:16,459 --> 00:11:17,935
thad is unfortunate for you.

112
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,237
you bring it back...

113
00:11:22,706 --> 00:11:23,617
that's impossible.

114
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:27,724
No, Maitland!
Nothing is impossible.

115
00:11:29,114 --> 00:11:31,453
you write to your daughter in England

116
00:11:32,141 --> 00:11:34,064
and tell her to bring
that map back to us

117
00:11:54,722 --> 00:11:56,992
the czar ... of Russia

118
00:11:57,785 --> 00:12:01,388
hired me to find that map
and he had a great army behind him.

119
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:07,633
I wasn't afraid of him...
and I am not afraid to die.

120
00:12:18,297 --> 00:12:21,880
I can produce pain
for worth than death.

121
00:13:00,257 --> 00:13:01,355
Father?

122
00:13:01,901 --> 00:13:03,364
Hello, Harry.

123
00:13:04,945 --> 00:13:05,890
Father!

124
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:10,581
oh god I missed you ...

125
00:13:10,626 --> 00:13:11,771
I also.

126
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:14,233
now let me look at you

127
00:13:17,366 --> 00:13:20,403
You're definitly not little Harry anymore,
I guess to call "great Harry" huh?

128
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:26,996
Hello, Charles.

129
00:13:28,544 --> 00:13:29,742
Who's there?

130
00:13:31,798 --> 00:13:32,996
Hi, Margaret.

131
00:13:34,508 --> 00:13:37,009
It's been a long time, Allan.

132
00:13:37,595 --> 00:13:38,710
Yes it is.

133
00:13:40,056 --> 00:13:44,268
- You can not go to take him back to Africa.
- No no .. I'm back...

134
00:13:45,145 --> 00:13:46,805
- I'm in London.
- No, Allan.

135
00:13:47,689 --> 00:13:51,125
Harry is happy here.
We have take in custody.

136
00:13:52,844 --> 00:13:53,625
If you'll excuse us.

137
00:14:02,704 --> 00:14:05,160
- I love you.
- I love you too.

138
00:14:12,423 --> 00:14:13,537
Go.

139
00:14:16,093 --> 00:14:17,801
See you soon.

140
00:14:18,888 --> 00:14:20,263
Come here

141
00:14:28,022 --> 00:14:30,140
Allan are filthy rich and
they're determined to keep him.

142
00:14:31,359 --> 00:14:34,775
yourself may well be seen by court and law,
but you abandoned your son.

143
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:37,606
I did not abandon my son.

144
00:14:38,324 --> 00:14:41,395
When his mother died, I sent him to London
to be with his grandparents,

145
00:14:41,369 --> 00:14:43,991
because I felt to do
the best thing at the time

146
00:14:44,372 --> 00:14:46,330
You sent him thousands
of kilometers away from you.

147
00:14:47,292 --> 00:14:48,407
For his own good!

148
00:14:48,585 --> 00:14:52,914
- yea you've choose to remain there.
- Austin, had to make a living.

149
00:14:53,924 --> 00:14:56,249
it's very exciting life you lead, Allan.

150
00:14:56,593 --> 00:14:58,467
Big game, hunting, go on safari ...

151
00:14:59,004 --> 00:15:00,564
Seeing the salvaged land firsttime

152
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:02,947
Nobody blames you for choosing
this above your family.

153
00:15:03,225 --> 00:15:06,192
I did not choose Africa
over my family.

154
00:15:08,081 --> 00:15:09,920
to be perfectly honest, Allan,

155
00:15:10,391 --> 00:15:13,313
in my opinion, Harry is far
better off with the grandparents.

156
00:15:13,694 --> 00:15:15,586
You have plenty money,
will go to find schools ...

157
00:15:15,855 --> 00:15:18,239
I'm not interested in
your opinion, Austin.

158
00:15:18,716 --> 00:15:21,621
I'm his father,
He is my blood.

159
00:15:21,894 --> 00:15:24,102
You need to tell me
wether I have a case or not.

160
00:15:24,881 --> 00:15:27,126
You have to proof to the court that

161
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:28,826
you are a suitable and responsible parent.

162
00:15:29,719 --> 00:15:31,703
what You need is money, Allan,
plain the other...

163
00:15:31,903 --> 00:15:33,603
because they going to fight
you tooth and nail.

164
00:15:34,941 --> 00:15:37,961
shure, I don't see any way that
you can get your son back. I'm sorry.

165
00:15:40,724 --> 00:15:46,390
He raised is handsome,
but has a very rare dog.

166
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:50,266
- It is a facocero.
- A facocero!

167
00:15:55,357 --> 00:15:57,084
Bartender, another one please.

168
00:15:59,236 --> 00:15:59,734
Troubles?

169
00:16:01,594 --> 00:16:05,493
normally I think to be
I trained to be a father?

170
00:16:07,141 --> 00:16:08,004
Yea..

171
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:12,663
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

172
00:16:16,301 --> 00:16:19,300
We were obviously in the
wrong place. Come Elizabeth....

173
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,500
... I don't want you to mix in ...

174
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,501
Captain, do not be silly.
If he is here we will find him

175
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:25,172
- Can I help you, ma'am?

176
00:16:26,372 --> 00:16:27,172
Yes...

177
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:31,229
We are looking for a gentleman
by the name Mr. Allan Quatermain.

178
00:16:31,649 --> 00:16:34,057
Hi. I am Allan Quatermain.

179
00:16:34,527 --> 00:16:36,734
No. I'm Allan Quatermain.

180
00:16:37,906 --> 00:16:40,741
Please, this is a lady,
no smoking people ...

181
00:16:40,909 --> 00:16:44,363
Ah, the American.
I think looking at the rate of background.

182
00:16:52,838 --> 00:16:54,747
Are you Mr. Allan Quatermain?

183
00:17:00,054 --> 00:17:01,334
My card.

184
00:17:05,935 --> 00:17:09,802
This is Captain Good.
We are interested in going to Africa.

185
00:17:09,981 --> 00:17:11,226
quite right

186
00:17:11,482 --> 00:17:14,768
now if you could manage to pull
yourself from your liberation for a moment

187
00:17:15,194 --> 00:17:18,663
I am Sorry, I am not in
the Safari business in...

188
00:17:19,782 --> 00:17:21,193
where you in ?

189
00:17:22,243 --> 00:17:23,868
Count Dracula...

190
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:25,450
They annoy me.

191
00:17:25,622 --> 00:17:28,291
you curbed your tongue, sir,
or you deal with me

192
00:17:36,716 --> 00:17:37,879
Ay ay, Captain!

193
00:17:38,885 --> 00:17:40,961
There is a great deal of money for you.

194
00:17:44,683 --> 00:17:46,177
to do that?

195
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,220
to help me find my father.

196
00:17:49,062 --> 00:17:50,972
He's been kidnapped in Africa.

197
00:17:52,858 --> 00:17:54,566
Africa is no place for a lady.

198
00:17:54,985 --> 00:17:57,274
I am not afraid of anything,
Mr. Quatermain.

199
00:17:58,113 --> 00:18:00,901
Especially when it comes
to save of my father's life

200
00:18:13,963 --> 00:18:16,633
That completes
and unpleasant man

201
00:18:17,491 --> 00:18:19,401
What was my father thinking to him?

202
00:18:19,677 --> 00:18:23,405
his well think to a rude drunk
with absolute no manners.

203
00:18:23,473 --> 00:18:25,781
- and he most common sense?
What?

204
00:18:26,685 --> 00:18:29,040
He makes apoint you
about you and Africa.

205
00:18:29,996 --> 00:18:32,648
Is it absolutely necessary
you go?

206
00:18:32,858 --> 00:18:35,859
Please do not start that again.
You know I made my mind up!

207
00:18:35,936 --> 00:18:40,364
If Quatermain won't take us,
then we find somebody who will...

208
00:18:42,618 --> 00:18:45,277
- Good!
- thank you

209
00:18:45,921 --> 00:18:47,213
Oh, Praytor.

210
00:18:48,682 --> 00:18:49,363
Bushell.

211
00:18:49,542 --> 00:18:51,782
What brings you back
to dry land, Captain?

212
00:18:52,253 --> 00:18:56,830
Well, ahmm this is my dearest
niece ... Elizabeth Maitland,

213
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:58,590
- Praytor, Bushell.
- M'am

214
00:18:58,759 --> 00:18:59,874
Haunted.

215
00:19:00,052 --> 00:19:03,587
Praytor and Bushell were with me
on HMS Hidalgo

216
00:19:03,764 --> 00:19:05,556
Or was it in Kincardine?

217
00:19:05,725 --> 00:19:09,675
Have many things to catch-up
I'll walk to the hotel.

218
00:19:09,937 --> 00:19:12,773
Very well then, but make sure
you stay to the main streets.

219
00:19:13,066 --> 00:19:17,644
- Bushell, Nice to meet you.
- Bushell, and where you are too?

220
00:19:27,999 --> 00:19:29,197
Oh no!

221
00:19:49,528 --> 00:19:51,564
Jaw, give it to me!

222
00:19:55,518 --> 00:19:56,845
Give me the map, Miss Maitland.

223
00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:02,184
- Sorry, what are you talking about?
- The map from your father. It belongs to us.

224
00:20:19,167 --> 00:20:20,030
you are right?

225
00:20:21,453 --> 00:20:23,829
Yea, Thank you.

226
00:20:24,314 --> 00:20:25,929
You are welcome.

227
00:20:27,951 --> 00:20:32,151
I did not realise, that your father
is Samuel Maitland,

228
00:20:32,322 --> 00:20:34,079
professor of archeology.

229
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:35,942
- that's right
- Tell me what happened there

230
00:20:36,418 --> 00:20:39,319
I told you. He has been kidnapped.
He sent me a letter.

231
00:20:40,064 --> 00:20:42,370
Did he say where they might
be hold him?

232
00:20:42,441 --> 00:20:44,900
Some place in southern Africa.

233
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:48,695
And I'm prepared to offer you a
great deal of money to take me there

234
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:52,284
Africa is a incredibly dangerous place,

235
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:56,207
quite far far remove
from the luxuries at home.

236
00:20:57,048 --> 00:20:58,210
Elizabeth!

237
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:00,111
Thank God you're back.

238
00:21:01,719 --> 00:21:03,297
Is anything all right?

239
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,636
yes somethings happened
Come quickly...

240
00:21:13,741 --> 00:21:16,934
- How is everything.
- Yes I know

241
00:21:35,145 --> 00:21:36,056
It was not a robbery.

242
00:21:47,391 --> 00:21:49,183
The man in the alleyway ...

243
00:21:51,729 --> 00:21:53,722
he was not after your purse

244
00:21:55,024 --> 00:21:56,649
He was looking for something else.

245
00:21:56,818 --> 00:21:59,309
- Have you been attacked?
- I'm fine, Captain

246
00:22:00,463 --> 00:22:03,162
I think there is something you
not telling me, Miss Maitland.

247
00:22:06,227 --> 00:22:06,807
Go...

248
00:22:07,387 --> 00:22:10,574
Before he was kidnaped,
my father sent me something

249
00:22:10,674 --> 00:22:11,417
- What?

250
00:22:11,792 --> 00:22:14,217
I am sure you have heard
of King Solomon mines

251
00:22:14,286 --> 00:22:17,191
King Solomon,s mines do not exist,
they are a myth.

252
00:22:22,703 --> 00:22:27,699
This map leads to the untold
wealth of the ancient Israelites.

253
00:22:28,993 --> 00:22:32,496
My father spent the best part
of 30 years, looking for it

254
00:22:33,031 --> 00:22:35,289
He told me to guard it
with my life.

255
00:22:36,384 --> 00:22:37,712
may I see it?

256
00:22:39,496 --> 00:22:43,462
I don't take it to Africa,
who ever kidnapped my father, will kill.

257
00:22:46,561 --> 00:22:49,969
- I do not think so.
- What?

258
00:22:50,264 --> 00:22:55,106
They sell these maps
to tourists in Cape Town.

259
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:58,871
no, it must be mistaken because
my father's life ...

260
00:22:59,048 --> 00:23:02,583
depends on me getting
that map to an African tribe,

261
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,967
in some place called Sitandra's Kraal.

262
00:23:05,338 --> 00:23:09,439
Sorry, the mines are a joke,
and this map ...

263
00:23:14,397 --> 00:23:15,642
What is it, Quatermain?

264
00:23:16,066 --> 00:23:19,102
well I can conceed,
that Professor Maitland

265
00:23:19,319 --> 00:23:23,269
made some unique discovery,
but I know that mines do not exist.

266
00:23:23,448 --> 00:23:26,118
I dn't care about the mines,

267
00:23:26,827 --> 00:23:28,654
I care about my father

268
00:23:31,457 --> 00:23:33,330
now will you help me to save him?

269
00:24:05,326 --> 00:24:07,615
CAPE TOWN

270
00:24:31,436 --> 00:24:33,409
huh a tourtle...

271
00:24:41,746 --> 00:24:44,304
good God...
do they always live like this?

272
00:24:44,357 --> 00:24:46,185
No, thank you, ma'am...

273
00:24:49,262 --> 00:24:50,541
Quatermain!

274
00:24:51,556 --> 00:24:55,127
I knew you would never
stay away from Africa longer

275
00:24:55,201 --> 00:24:57,577
- good to have you back.
- this be back so...

276
00:24:57,753 --> 00:24:59,795
only for short time
I'm visiting.

277
00:24:59,872 --> 00:25:02,646
- I'll believe when I see it.
- Believe it.

278
00:25:02,717 --> 00:25:05,191
- stay out of trouble!
- I will try.

279
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:09,140
- you should run for governor.
- oh too dangerous.

280
00:25:24,373 --> 00:25:25,932
Hey! It is Quatermain.

281
00:25:27,026 --> 00:25:28,071
Sambona.

282
00:25:29,003 --> 00:25:31,027
Numza Quatermain.

283
00:25:31,331 --> 00:25:33,029
Sambona, numza.

284
00:25:36,669 --> 00:25:39,077
You're an old dog.

285
00:25:39,589 --> 00:25:43,473
I knew you'd find
another woman.

286
00:25:43,635 --> 00:25:46,802
You're wrong Khiva,
She is not my wife.

287
00:25:47,097 --> 00:25:49,888
but she is so beautiful...

288
00:25:50,434 --> 00:25:54,337
Yes, I know. But,
believe me, she is a bit difficult.

289
00:25:55,855 --> 00:25:58,062
I could manage this

290
00:25:59,610 --> 00:26:01,484
What did they said?

291
00:26:01,987 --> 00:26:03,712
The weather has been terrible.

292
00:26:03,948 --> 00:26:06,671
Miss Elizabeth Maitland,
Captain Good,

293
00:26:07,276 --> 00:26:10,493
Khiva and Ventvogel.
Vent for short.

294
00:26:11,188 --> 00:26:15,886
I have a job for you,
but you look a little busy.

295
00:26:15,459 --> 00:26:18,962
- aahh We are not.
- We are ready for you

296
00:26:21,716 --> 00:26:25,761
you would not gone believe it,
but we are looking for the mines.

297
00:26:29,307 --> 00:26:30,552
It's her.

298
00:26:32,877 --> 00:26:36,926
- Did you see the map?
- Niet, but she is traveling with others.

299
00:26:37,273 --> 00:26:38,519
The old one

300
00:26:39,768 --> 00:26:41,199
and Quatermain.

301
00:26:42,937 --> 00:26:44,313
you recognise it?

302
00:26:46,116 --> 00:26:47,195
oh Yes.

303
00:26:54,574 --> 00:26:56,648
so Tell me about that Quatermain.

304
00:26:59,313 --> 00:27:01,589
He arrive in this country twelve years ago.

305
00:27:02,299 --> 00:27:05,568
He setup to my office straight
off the ship, nothing then a rifle.

306
00:27:07,179 --> 00:27:09,848
I took him on
For a while, we did well.

307
00:27:10,849 --> 00:27:12,012
And then?

308
00:27:12,184 --> 00:27:14,592
He brought his wife on to Africa,
He had a child.

309
00:27:15,646 --> 00:27:17,140
Then, he got careless.

310
00:27:18,232 --> 00:27:19,809
He took his wife on safari.

311
00:27:20,818 --> 00:27:23,391
she got mauled by a lioness
protecting her cubs.

312
00:27:27,199 --> 00:27:28,907
of course he went crazy,

313
00:27:29,368 --> 00:27:32,951
start of thinking he been punished
for all the killing he done

314
00:27:33,539 --> 00:27:35,164
And then he turned on me.

315
00:27:37,043 --> 00:27:38,454
What if we have to kill him?

316
00:27:41,756 --> 00:27:43,998
let's just say he wan't return on me again...

317
00:27:49,931 --> 00:27:52,885
you understand that the map
they carry is the property of Tsar?

318
00:27:54,269 --> 00:27:56,377
I understand you need a guide
who knows Africa better...

319
00:27:56,146 --> 00:27:58,669
than your two friends here from Siberia.

320
00:28:01,234 --> 00:28:04,022
You will be our guide for 10%
of whatever we find.

321
00:28:04,446 --> 00:28:06,439
25 And now say 22 and a half.

322
00:28:14,023 --> 00:28:15,237
fine, deal.

323
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:21,544
Lady's and Gentlemen, the Bloem hotel.

324
00:28:21,714 --> 00:28:24,798
Oh, there it is... It's pleasant enough

325
00:28:24,967 --> 00:28:28,585
Miss Maitland, I trust you have
suitable clothing for a safari.

326
00:28:29,388 --> 00:28:32,425
I belive I have suitable
clothing for a safari, Mr. Quatermain.

327
00:28:35,728 --> 00:28:36,926
after you...

328
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,401
Thank you.

329
00:28:54,372 --> 00:28:56,531
- and What is this?
- Ostrich Neck, sir.

330
00:28:57,084 --> 00:28:59,539
- Ostrich Neck?
- you don't like it boss?

331
00:28:59,836 --> 00:29:00,999
I do not know.

332
00:29:04,633 --> 00:29:05,796
"Bon Apetit".

333
00:29:07,219 --> 00:29:08,879
What time do we leave tomorrow?

334
00:29:09,888 --> 00:29:11,169
At dawn.

335
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,896
Quatermain,

336
00:29:18,522 --> 00:29:20,480
You're a disgrace.

337
00:29:20,691 --> 00:29:24,191
I've I told you not to show your
ugly face around this parts again?

338
00:29:25,863 --> 00:29:30,324
Mr. Quatermain, there is a
very large hairy gentleman

339
00:29:30,785 --> 00:29:32,576
requesting your attention.

340
00:29:33,079 --> 00:29:35,119
Yes, Miss Maitland,
and I smell him.

341
00:29:35,623 --> 00:29:37,782
Why just stand up
and fight like a man?

342
00:29:38,126 --> 00:29:40,498
Or, in your case,
as a woman.

343
00:29:50,055 --> 00:29:51,253
would you excuse me.

344
00:29:58,647 --> 00:29:59,975
Forgive me.

345
00:30:01,483 --> 00:30:03,275
here gond to face!

346
00:30:05,487 --> 00:30:07,361
Good! That's very good!

347
00:30:10,618 --> 00:30:12,657
Try an African tree,
for a change.

348
00:30:28,011 --> 00:30:30,336
Won't you going do something
To help him?

349
00:30:43,318 --> 00:30:46,987
You can dance for your concubine,
but you not can ...

350
00:30:49,491 --> 00:30:51,234
you Scottish ...

351
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,994
Captain, stop them!

352
00:30:55,789 --> 00:30:57,070
What?

353
00:31:08,427 --> 00:31:09,886
Already done you, Henry?

354
00:31:11,013 --> 00:31:13,006
I don't know what you,
to drink.

355
00:31:19,063 --> 00:31:20,344
Thank you, Captain.

356
00:31:27,071 --> 00:31:31,864
so that is professor  Maitland
he is been held by a native tribe.

357
00:31:33,244 --> 00:31:37,028
yes, ahm he call them the Kuakuani.

358
00:31:37,832 --> 00:31:41,664
- Did you ever heard about them?
- No, I must say I haven't.

359
00:31:42,838 --> 00:31:45,210
what they want with a professor, Maitland?

360
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:49,006
Well that's where it gets very interesting.

361
00:31:49,577 --> 00:31:51,700
we need going to that team
Mr Quatermain?

362
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:58,728
Ms. Maitland, all thous
Sir Henry may not look like much

363
00:31:59,688 --> 00:32:02,642
he is honorable and I would
trust this man with my life

364
00:32:05,845 --> 00:32:07,024
All right.

365
00:32:07,921 --> 00:32:10,953
And what do you think is genuine?

366
00:32:12,076 --> 00:32:13,321
Henry ...

367
00:32:13,494 --> 00:32:16,828
This journy isn't defined
locating mines and finding riches,

368
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:19,331
but saving my father's life.

369
00:32:21,002 --> 00:32:23,789
I believe in cold, hard cash, Missy

370
00:32:24,505 --> 00:32:26,831
And I belive that I am paying handsomely

371
00:32:27,133 --> 00:32:29,458
to help me trade
this map for my father.

372
00:32:30,011 --> 00:32:31,838
What you do after that
is up to you...

373
00:32:32,389 --> 00:32:33,669
Good night Messrs.

374
00:32:42,315 --> 00:32:44,641
You never learn deal,
Quatermain?

375
00:32:46,361 --> 00:32:48,401
what are you talking?

376
00:32:49,114 --> 00:32:51,688
Taking a woman out there ...

377
00:32:59,458 --> 00:33:01,036
I heard everything.

378
00:33:02,253 --> 00:33:03,711
Do you have the money?

379
00:33:05,923 --> 00:33:07,417
They are leaving tomorrow.

380
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:10,755
Where to?

381
00:33:10,928 --> 00:33:12,470
Sitandra's Kraal.

382
00:33:13,473 --> 00:33:15,845
They are to meet a native
and give him a map.

383
00:34:20,584 --> 00:34:22,742
CAPE TOWN

384
00:34:57,171 --> 00:34:58,500
What do you reading?

385
00:34:59,799 --> 00:35:02,257
The mystery of King
Solomon's the treasures

386
00:35:02,719 --> 00:35:05,423
King Solomon's Mines
are part of ancient history.

387
00:35:05,722 --> 00:35:08,710
like Captain Kidd's treasure,
or Atlantis.

388
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:11,425
- Right, Quatermain?
- Something like that.

389
00:35:11,603 --> 00:35:14,769
Not deceive pulje.
Quatermain believes in the mines.

390
00:35:15,482 --> 00:35:18,399
- he even tried to find at once.
- Really?

391
00:35:19,361 --> 00:35:20,606
I was a kid.

392
00:35:21,279 --> 00:35:24,314
- You are almost 30ty
- it was used to go,

393
00:35:24,491 --> 00:35:28,128
and I never found one shred of evidence
to proof that the mines exist.

394
00:35:28,245 --> 00:35:31,080
Yeah, but a good story sir

395
00:35:32,082 --> 00:35:34,075
Wen you tell us about,
Miss Maitland?

396
00:35:34,251 --> 00:35:37,205
- Why not? To let pass the time.

397
00:35:38,088 --> 00:35:41,455
Well, according to the Biblical account,

398
00:35:42,009 --> 00:35:45,212
King Solomon ruled Judea
for 40 years.

399
00:35:46,013 --> 00:35:48,683
He supposedly a very wise king

400
00:35:48,849 --> 00:35:52,218
who united the land surround
Jerusalem into a single country.

401
00:35:52,645 --> 00:35:56,477
And he built one temple to
the one God of the Hebrews,

402
00:35:56,941 --> 00:36:01,105
it would to rival all the grand palaces
of Mesopotamia and Egypt.

403
00:36:01,904 --> 00:36:04,859
So he sent his men
the far corners of the world

404
00:36:05,116 --> 00:36:09,280
and they found a place where it was said
the ancestors of the ancient

405
00:36:09,621 --> 00:36:12,990
They had a huge treasure trove
of riches of all kinds:

406
00:36:13,792 --> 00:36:16,365
Diamonds, gold, emeralds, rubies.

407
00:36:16,962 --> 00:36:19,120
That place was called Ophir.

408
00:36:19,756 --> 00:36:22,049
And, in return, those riches
They were used

409
00:36:22,125 --> 00:36:23,965
to adorn King Solomon's temple

410
00:36:24,136 --> 00:36:26,628
and nothing in the world
could rival this.

411
00:36:26,889 --> 00:36:30,090
However, it is said,
that only a small amount...

412
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:33,428
of what the men found in Ophir
was actually used in the temple.

413
00:36:33,604 --> 00:36:35,512
And the rest is yet to be found.

414
00:37:04,219 --> 00:37:05,679
Would you care to have some, Boss?

415
00:37:06,054 --> 00:37:08,627
It Depends. What do you eat?

416
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:11,424
An African delicacy.

417
00:37:11,893 --> 00:37:13,802
you know, more like your caviar.

418
00:37:14,646 --> 00:37:16,188
- Caviar?
- yea.

419
00:37:17,149 --> 00:37:19,307
Well, then I'll ... give it a try.

420
00:37:26,325 --> 00:37:29,609
Not so bad... How do you call it?

421
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:31,776
Mopani worms.

422
00:37:33,666 --> 00:37:35,492
- Worms?

423
00:38:02,112 --> 00:38:03,689
absolutly beautiful.

424
00:38:10,495 --> 00:38:12,535
the Savannah, Miss Maitland.

425
00:38:13,832 --> 00:38:15,326
truly Beautiful, is it not?

426
00:38:16,084 --> 00:38:17,116
Yes.

427
00:38:21,215 --> 00:38:22,673
so Let me take a look.

428
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:25,210
Honestly, Mr. Quatermain!

429
00:38:27,262 --> 00:38:30,513
How does your wife tolerate
your uncivilized behavior.

430
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:40,142
Put this on. It just might help.

431
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:53,871
His wife died, Miss Maitland.

432
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:56,875
It happened a long time ago.

433
00:38:58,002 --> 00:38:59,461
And, for your information,

434
00:38:59,963 --> 00:39:03,047
I think she liked this...
uncivilized behavior.

435
00:39:48,137 --> 00:39:49,548
What are you doing?

436
00:39:53,601 --> 00:39:55,760
Determining whether you shall live or die.

437
00:39:57,814 --> 00:40:01,597
She is reading your daughter's thoughts

438
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:05,564
If Gagool sees your daughter coming,
then you shall live.

439
00:40:06,364 --> 00:40:08,025
If not...

440
00:40:11,328 --> 00:40:12,822
What do you see, Gagool?

441
00:40:13,163 --> 00:40:15,203
The vision is blurred.

442
00:40:18,293 --> 00:40:20,203
It seems that
your daughter has failed.

443
00:40:22,214 --> 00:40:24,207
Wait, I see something.

444
00:40:24,425 --> 00:40:31,507
She travels with three white men
to Sitandra's Kraal

445
00:40:49,409 --> 00:40:52,694
Good news.
Your daughter brings the map.

446
00:40:53,788 --> 00:40:55,698
He shall live... for now.

447
00:40:57,667 --> 00:41:01,868
you know, I do't understand, Twala,

448
00:41:04,216 --> 00:41:07,003
What you want with the mines?
You have no need for their riches.

449
00:41:07,177 --> 00:41:09,086
It is not riches that I crave.

450
00:41:12,349 --> 00:41:17,495
you crave power:
Stone of the Ancestors.

451
00:41:17,671 --> 00:41:21,516
But why? You are the king of
these lands. Of all these people.

452
00:41:21,483 --> 00:41:24,235
Is not enough!

453
00:41:26,947 --> 00:41:30,114
My father was banned from this place
and sent to the land of the white man.

454
00:41:32,662 --> 00:41:34,453
I was raised amongst you.

455
00:41:39,043 --> 00:41:40,454
if I know who you are.

456
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:45,002
And I know the best way to defeat you.

457
00:43:02,546 --> 00:43:06,711
Hey, little guy ...
Come here.

458
00:43:07,968 --> 00:43:10,008
- Boss!
- Khiva, Vent!

459
00:43:12,598 --> 00:43:16,048
Miss Maitland, stop!
Do not touch those puppies!

460
00:43:16,477 --> 00:43:19,066
They are alone. If we leave them here,
They will die.

461
00:43:19,138 --> 00:43:20,183
Then shall be it.

462
00:43:20,690 --> 00:43:22,148
Don't talk to me!

463
00:43:22,316 --> 00:43:27,062
Listen, their mother is either dead
or right behind thad bushes,

464
00:43:27,238 --> 00:43:29,396
waiting to come down on you-
or one of these antelopes.

465
00:43:29,782 --> 00:43:31,656
Is this really necessary,
Quatermain?

466
00:43:32,118 --> 00:43:36,614
Captain Good...
this is not your London high society,

467
00:43:37,165 --> 00:43:39,323
where all you have at stake
is your reputation.

468
00:43:39,501 --> 00:43:42,122
This here... it is your life
what is at stake!

469
00:43:46,007 --> 00:43:48,878
- All clear, Quatermain.
- Thank you, Henry.

470
00:43:50,812 --> 00:43:53,800
It's late... We need
to find a save place to camp.

471
00:43:55,892 --> 00:43:57,007
all right.

472
00:44:14,078 --> 00:44:16,616
I have never seen so many stars

473
00:44:17,498 --> 00:44:19,123
It's really beautiful as here.

474
00:44:20,543 --> 00:44:22,286
Thus seduces the savannah.

475
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:25,290
- Khiva.
- Numza.

476
00:44:25,882 --> 00:44:29,547
Who take turns guard for tonight?
I take the first one.

477
00:44:29,719 --> 00:44:31,961
ok Goodnight my friend.

478
00:44:32,347 --> 00:44:34,754
Why we need a fire in this heat?

479
00:44:34,933 --> 00:44:37,471
To keep predators away, Captain.

480
00:44:39,229 --> 00:44:43,772
Oh I see. Well if you...
need me, just Call.

481
00:44:44,192 --> 00:44:45,473
Good night.

482
00:44:49,948 --> 00:44:53,613
I am beginning to see why
my father loves Africa so much.

483
00:44:54,953 --> 00:44:56,448
It's breath taking.

484
00:44:57,831 --> 00:44:59,112
Yes it is.

485
00:45:00,501 --> 00:45:02,992
You mean to say,
we actually agree on something.

486
00:45:07,258 --> 00:45:08,503
Supposed so.

487
00:45:10,803 --> 00:45:12,083
Look at this.

488
00:45:19,604 --> 00:45:22,688
Thank you...
for coming on this journey with me.

489
00:45:30,865 --> 00:45:34,863
It's getting late...
Tomorrow we have a lot to ride.

490
00:45:37,163 --> 00:45:38,326
all right

491
00:45:40,250 --> 00:45:41,792
Good night, Mr. Quatermain.

492
00:45:42,377 --> 00:45:43,752
Good night, Ms. Maitland.

493
00:46:46,694 --> 00:46:49,914
Believe me, she is a lot more afraid
than you are of her

494
00:46:50,139 --> 00:46:51,054
Isn't she doesn't.

495
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:53,508
are you all right?

496
00:47:01,076 --> 00:47:03,156
All clear, Quatermain?

497
00:47:04,012 --> 00:47:05,006
Nicely done, Henry.

498
00:47:06,289 --> 00:47:09,462
When you find
a proper cat, let me know.

499
00:47:10,936 --> 00:47:11,830
Good Morning!

500
00:47:13,855 --> 00:47:18,470
A lovely day!
Did you sleep well, Elizabeth?

501
00:47:19,370 --> 00:47:23,154
- Henry, what's for breakfast?
- Fillets painted.

502
00:47:55,164 --> 00:47:58,116
- How are you holding up?
- just fine, Mr. Quatermain.

503
00:47:58,359 --> 00:48:00,932
How much far that is Sitandra's Kraal?

504
00:48:01,137 --> 00:48:05,141
about... three hours,
if we're lucky.

505
00:49:26,676 --> 00:49:27,921
that are men.

506
00:49:30,213 --> 00:49:34,447
the all Safety is my responsibility,
There has to be another way.

507
00:49:34,567 --> 00:49:37,105
my Father's letter was very specific.

508
00:49:37,261 --> 00:49:40,238
I have to make the change by myself.

509
00:49:41,115 --> 00:49:42,357
she's right, Captain.

510
00:49:42,325 --> 00:49:44,368
prefer Elizabeth to go alone?

511
00:49:44,344 --> 00:49:47,085
We will be right behind
you the whole way.

512
00:49:47,906 --> 00:49:52,520
If you see anything suspicious at all,
you yell as loud as you can...

513
00:49:52,594 --> 00:49:55,349
and you run for cover,
you hear?

514
00:50:01,518 --> 00:50:04,266
you be very very careful.

515
00:50:08,049 --> 00:50:09,028
now go

516
00:50:14,824 --> 00:50:16,462
Vent, behind those rocks.

517
00:50:16,435 --> 00:50:19,074
Khiva, right side
behind the bush.

518
00:50:41,937 --> 00:50:43,717
give map.

519
00:50:43,922 --> 00:50:47,457
No... not until I see my father.

520
00:50:48,176 --> 00:50:49,974
Give me map!

521
00:50:50,011 --> 00:50:52,519
Not until
You show me my father!

522
00:50:52,856 --> 00:50:55,112
Put the map down, Miss Maitland.

523
00:50:56,184 --> 00:50:57,982
back away.

524
00:51:15,654 --> 00:51:18,677
Quatermain- We got a problem.

525
00:51:18,924 --> 00:51:22,476
I think this is our man
and he's dead?

526
00:51:26,582 --> 00:51:29,522
Elizabeth! Run!

527
00:52:03,912 --> 00:52:05,707
Cover me!

528
00:52:10,977 --> 00:52:13,066
Miss Maitland!

529
00:52:30,915 --> 00:52:33,542
get on, Miss Maitland!

530
00:52:33,717 --> 00:52:36,173
com on.

531
00:52:52,104 --> 00:52:54,892
Sergei! I'm hurt!

532
00:52:56,174 --> 00:52:59,525
Come on! leave!

533
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:18,355
Elizabeth!

534
00:53:19,690 --> 00:53:20,505
are you all right?

535
00:53:20,383 --> 00:53:23,557
I don't like Russians...
And they knew about the map.

536
00:53:23,636 --> 00:53:27,271
Russians?
What the hell Russians doing here?

537
00:53:28,382 --> 00:53:28,963
I'm fine.

538
00:53:32,069 --> 00:53:35,654
Elizabeth, you must tell him.

539
00:53:36,750 --> 00:53:38,695
Tell me what?

540
00:53:39,152 --> 00:53:40,944
For the last three years,

541
00:53:41,363 --> 00:53:44,032
My father is presumed
of King Solomon's Mines

542
00:53:44,199 --> 00:53:46,392
It has been financed
by Tsar of Russia.

543
00:53:48,829 --> 00:53:51,783
I supose they think
the map belongs to him.

544
00:53:55,544 --> 00:53:58,117
I didn't think he would be an issue!

545
00:53:58,714 --> 00:53:59,829
OMG.

546
00:54:15,898 --> 00:54:18,105
Petre is wounded!
Where were you?

547
00:54:18,693 --> 00:54:19,973
You were supposed to cover us!

548
00:54:20,153 --> 00:54:22,774
I was not hired to kill
for your precious Russia.

549
00:54:22,947 --> 00:54:25,652
you had a shot on Quatermain
I know you had a shot.

550
00:54:25,825 --> 00:54:28,365
I'm a tracker.
I track that's what I do

551
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:30,803
If you want to kill Quatermain,
you go ahead.

552
00:54:30,903 --> 00:54:32,703
That's your departmenmt, not mine.

553
00:54:32,274 --> 00:54:33,951
you'r a coward, McNabb.

554
00:54:34,376 --> 00:54:37,377
you signed with us
you made that choice!

555
00:54:37,438 --> 00:54:39,248
live with it.,..

556
00:54:40,757 --> 00:54:44,625
Because, after today...
your friend Quatermain

557
00:54:45,220 --> 00:54:47,012
wouldn't hesitate to kill you!

558
00:54:48,515 --> 00:54:50,489
he headed inland.

559
00:54:50,726 --> 00:54:54,261
the Tribes on the other side of those
Mountains are not very friendly.

560
00:54:54,605 --> 00:54:57,772
we stay on the trail,
and let him do the work.

561
00:55:13,124 --> 00:55:15,081
Everything is going to be fine.

562
00:55:17,086 --> 00:55:19,542
Well, and how?
What are we going to do now?

563
00:55:25,220 --> 00:55:27,011
- Henry!
- noo.

564
00:55:27,722 --> 00:55:31,174
I know what you thinking, Quatermain.
but you can just forget about it!

565
00:55:31,551 --> 00:55:34,020
It is time to visit an old friend.

566
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:36,856
- Nooo.
- Yes.

567
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:40,940
Momma Tuussee.

568
00:55:41,278 --> 00:55:42,938
It is a sangoma.

569
00:55:53,540 --> 00:55:57,289
Sir Henry.
how long has it been!

570
00:56:07,305 --> 00:56:10,140
It don't we should be
talking to a witch doctor

571
00:56:11,225 --> 00:56:12,933
We have no choice.

572
00:56:18,466 --> 00:56:20,475
His father is a teacher.

573
00:56:21,277 --> 00:56:23,187
Professor, actually.

574
00:56:25,865 --> 00:56:30,444
Sir Henry... I think you've something
for me that might help.

575
00:56:31,830 --> 00:56:33,454
A necklace.

576
00:56:51,183 --> 00:56:52,761
he was a Kuakuani.

577
00:56:53,602 --> 00:56:55,642
Very loyal to their king.

578
00:56:57,022 --> 00:56:58,849
A man named Twala.

579
00:57:02,612 --> 00:57:05,019
Twala holds your father.

580
00:57:08,659 --> 00:57:10,118
you have a map.

581
00:57:11,746 --> 00:57:13,205
Let me see it.

582
00:57:27,345 --> 00:57:30,880
Follow the map... get the key.

583
00:57:31,058 --> 00:57:32,256
What key?

584
00:57:32,559 --> 00:57:34,468
The key to King Solomon's mines.

585
00:57:36,772 --> 00:57:39,642
You will find the key
in the tomb of Virtuoso's

586
00:57:39,817 --> 00:57:41,809
in the sands of the great desert.

587
00:57:43,821 --> 00:57:46,690
Follow the path to Sheba's eye,

588
00:57:46,865 --> 00:57:50,351
through her breasts and
into the valley of the Kuakuani.

589
00:57:50,828 --> 00:57:52,406
The mine is there.

590
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:55,951
And Twala will be waiting.

591
00:57:57,835 --> 00:57:59,164
And my father?

592
00:57:59,545 --> 00:58:03,328
He too,
by the grace of the ancestors.

593
00:58:05,259 --> 00:58:07,933
go, travel quickly

594
00:58:08,805 --> 00:58:10,513
there isn't much time

595
00:58:15,061 --> 00:58:18,098
What would happen in there...
and who is the Twala?

596
00:58:18,815 --> 00:58:20,309
I don't know.

597
00:58:21,234 --> 00:58:23,357
stages one way up...

598
00:58:29,368 --> 00:58:30,910
Wait here a minute.

599
00:58:44,925 --> 00:58:46,882
Who you are? And what do you want?

600
00:58:48,095 --> 00:58:49,673
I am Umbopa.

601
00:58:51,007 --> 00:58:55,135
You are heading north.
I was born in the north.

602
00:58:55,887 --> 00:58:58,639
I haven't been home for a long time...
I will go with you.

603
00:58:58,806 --> 00:59:01,973
I thank you...
but we don't need another bearer

604
00:59:04,312 --> 00:59:07,397
I require no premium,
I can be of grate assistance...

605
00:59:07,774 --> 00:59:09,601
just the same:
I don't need any more men.

606
00:59:11,278 --> 00:59:15,441
I know this land very well, and
I've crossed the great desert before.

607
00:59:22,623 --> 00:59:25,244
Khiva is chief bearer,
he tell you what to do

608
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:28,371
already anyone, it's enough...

609
00:59:30,214 --> 00:59:32,872
we are now moving
in an uncharted territory.

610
00:59:32,850 --> 00:59:35,241
Where few have gone
and even fewer have returned...

611
00:59:35,970 --> 00:59:39,471
so if there is anyone in awe to turn back,
I suggest to do it now.

612
00:59:40,975 --> 00:59:42,220
There's shame.

613
00:59:42,393 --> 00:59:43,674
We'll all go with you.

614
00:59:43,853 --> 00:59:47,704
Of course not, Quatermain.
We have no option.

615
00:59:50,193 --> 00:59:52,900
Why do you think
African tribes to be interested

616
00:59:52,879 --> 00:59:54,321
in King Solomon's mines?

617
00:59:54,489 --> 00:59:57,241
They have no use Gold, Jewelry
and stuff like that.

618
00:59:57,867 --> 00:59:59,148
It's a good question.

619
01:00:00,328 --> 01:00:01,822
I think it's the Stone.

620
01:00:04,916 --> 01:00:07,009
What are you talking about? What stone?

621
01:00:08,378 --> 01:00:11,628
Legend tell that king Salomon's mines
contain an ancient relic.

622
01:00:11,965 --> 01:00:13,625
The Stone of the Ancestors.

623
01:00:14,509 --> 01:00:16,801
Do you think that's why
they holding my father?

624
01:00:17,596 --> 01:00:21,412
They do say that one who holds
the stone rules all of Africa

625
01:00:25,913 --> 01:00:26,975
Let's move out!

626
01:00:46,376 --> 01:00:48,036
Do you see them?

627
01:01:15,823 --> 01:01:18,942
All right...
This is where we dump the horses.

628
01:01:20,411 --> 01:01:23,862
We let them go now, they have some
chance to get back to Sitandra's alive.

629
01:01:24,456 --> 01:01:26,745
What do you mean
we are leaving the horses?

630
01:01:27,793 --> 01:01:29,585
We're being followed, Captain.

631
01:01:30,663 --> 01:01:32,405
- so Henry.
- Yes, Quatermain.

632
01:01:32,173 --> 01:01:36,456
You, Vent and Khiva, put together only
what we absolutely need for the trip.

633
01:01:36,594 --> 01:01:39,003
and get the rest together
to Boobath.

634
01:01:39,180 --> 01:01:41,205
Captain,
keep to help, please?

635
01:01:43,142 --> 01:01:45,135
Are we're going out there on foot?

636
01:01:47,355 --> 01:01:52,516
Miss Maitland...
You should go back with the horses.

637
01:01:52,944 --> 01:01:56,644
Momma Tuussee can arrange
save passage to Cape Town for you

638
01:01:56,698 --> 01:01:59,571
- What about my father?
- I will find your father.

639
01:02:02,204 --> 01:02:05,654
Look,
I need to apologize.

640
01:02:06,541 --> 01:02:08,818
I should have told you about the Russians.

641
01:02:12,089 --> 01:02:17,798
The truth is...
you have done not bad.

642
01:02:24,143 --> 01:02:25,685
I also think

643
01:02:27,438 --> 01:02:29,814
your father will be
very proud of you.

644
01:02:31,359 --> 01:02:32,901
I hope so.

645
01:02:33,653 --> 01:02:37,452
I need to see this through.
I am stay.

646
01:02:38,449 --> 01:02:42,664
The horses are ready, Boss...
And so am I.

647
01:02:44,163 --> 01:02:45,678
all right.

648
01:02:46,124 --> 01:02:47,915
Khiva, you stay with me.

649
01:02:48,376 --> 01:02:51,413
Vent, I mean you take
three barers,

650
01:02:51,963 --> 01:02:54,190
I need you square movy area.

651
01:02:54,382 --> 01:02:58,534
you Take two horses east,
two horses south.

652
01:02:59,145 --> 01:03:00,972
This confuse the hell all these guys.

653
01:03:01,189 --> 01:03:04,225
bring back a round and we
meet up tonight at Cascamba river.

654
01:03:04,492 --> 01:03:06,103
- All right.

655
01:03:07,295 --> 01:03:09,902
- and ber there!

656
01:03:14,402 --> 01:03:17,620
I certainly hope you know
what you got yourself into.

657
01:03:17,973 --> 01:03:18,618
I do.

658
01:03:21,393 --> 01:03:23,065
There goes our transporters

659
01:03:24,796 --> 01:03:26,753
Take your shoes off.

660
01:03:27,408 --> 01:03:30,214
We want them follow horses, not us.

661
01:03:45,651 --> 01:03:48,440
They were just here
few hours ago at most.

662
01:03:48,455 --> 01:03:49,830
over here

663
01:03:50,757 --> 01:03:53,730
Tracks.
They went this way.

664
01:03:54,394 --> 01:03:55,574
No, wait.

665
01:03:56,996 --> 01:03:59,997
Here... Two sets of tracks.

666
01:04:01,042 --> 01:04:02,918
what now?

667
01:04:09,843 --> 01:04:11,521
Which way, McNabb?

668
01:04:16,742 --> 01:04:19,597
Stop wasting your time McNabb!
Which way?

669
01:04:20,646 --> 01:04:23,304
Quatermain released the horses.

670
01:04:25,892 --> 01:04:29,956
There are a ruse.
They went this way... On foot.

671
01:04:31,599 --> 01:04:33,708
How do you know?
I see no boot prints.

672
01:04:33,584 --> 01:04:35,507
There feet made those tracks...

673
01:04:36,029 --> 01:04:38,535
Believe me,
another way Quatermain thinks.

674
01:04:50,903 --> 01:04:53,963
bad ascent

675
01:04:59,978 --> 01:05:04,836
- Let me help you, Boss.
- nonsense... I get in my face same

676
01:05:06,276 --> 01:05:08,648
Sure this is my face same?

677
01:05:20,416 --> 01:05:23,636
It's really amazing,
we are walking in a place

678
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:26,463
that hasn't changed
in thousands of years.

679
01:05:28,883 --> 01:05:31,588
Most people only
see desolation in the desert.

680
01:05:32,094 --> 01:05:34,787
I can't believe
It's taken me this long to get here

681
01:05:35,556 --> 01:05:37,845
Why didn't you ever asked your father
if you could to join?

682
01:05:38,017 --> 01:05:40,722
I did... all the time.

683
01:05:42,230 --> 01:05:43,854
But, like you, he thought...

684
01:05:44,816 --> 01:05:48,517
his fragile daughter
will be best let home.

685
01:05:48,987 --> 01:05:50,861
was too dangerous for me to go.

686
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:58,994
You don't see much, huh?

687
01:06:21,854 --> 01:06:23,763
This is ridiculous.

688
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:28,440
Quatermain, it's been a long day.

689
01:06:30,905 --> 01:06:34,239
- Why don't we camp?
- We try to remain invisible, Captain

690
01:06:34,867 --> 01:06:36,330
This is way to out in the open

691
01:06:36,502 --> 01:06:38,824
We wait for dige
water will gone.

692
01:06:39,956 --> 01:06:41,201
Someone is coming.

693
01:06:50,467 --> 01:06:52,091
Sambona, Vent!

694
01:06:53,220 --> 01:06:55,046
- Sorry, Boss.
- What happened?

695
01:06:55,472 --> 01:06:58,389
I let them serial moles
but I don't think they followed

696
01:06:58,558 --> 01:07:01,228
It seems our Russian friends
have a tracker.

697
01:07:02,479 --> 01:07:04,388
Maybe it's best to follow.

698
01:07:05,065 --> 01:07:06,939
Well what's the difference if we camp?

699
01:07:07,901 --> 01:07:09,526
They know that we're here.

700
01:07:10,046 --> 01:07:11,873
At least, we will be rested.

701
01:07:13,157 --> 01:07:15,031
Yes, is an excellent idea, Captain.

702
01:07:17,077 --> 01:07:20,663
Khiva, take the bearers, erect the tents,
Gather wood build a fire.

703
01:07:20,539 --> 01:07:21,984
Yes, Boss.

704
01:07:23,292 --> 01:07:26,993
- So you finally come to your senses.
- something like that

705
01:07:47,859 --> 01:07:50,564
They are still asleep
This is the chance.

706
01:07:50,862 --> 01:07:52,404
Don't take him for a fool!

707
01:07:53,323 --> 01:07:56,110
He knows we are following him
He will already made sure of that.

708
01:08:00,038 --> 01:08:02,197
The map is the property
of Mother Russia.

709
01:08:02,833 --> 01:08:04,909
I take my orders directly from the czar,

710
01:08:06,587 --> 01:08:07,785
not from you!

711
01:08:08,130 --> 01:08:09,974
I thought we agreed that
let Quatermain take the risk

712
01:08:10,149 --> 01:08:11,840
that a spear he get from a native?

713
01:08:12,384 --> 01:08:16,714
- We simply follow
- No... We take the map now.

714
01:08:17,348 --> 01:08:20,135
I want as few people as
possible getting to those mines.

715
01:08:20,309 --> 01:08:22,800
Go impatience, my friend already
got his man shot.

716
01:08:23,396 --> 01:08:26,101
And your procrastination is a weakness.

717
01:09:38,807 --> 01:09:39,886
Colonel,

718
01:09:40,308 --> 01:09:41,637
they were never here.

719
01:09:42,519 --> 01:09:43,634
Ivan ...

720
01:10:08,129 --> 01:10:09,837
We do it my way now?

721
01:10:59,723 --> 01:11:02,677
I pray facing towards home
each morning.

722
01:11:04,520 --> 01:11:05,979
It gives me strength.

723
01:11:08,232 --> 01:11:10,024
How long has it been since you been there?

724
01:11:10,484 --> 01:11:13,272
I was forced to leave
When I was just a small child

725
01:11:13,696 --> 01:11:16,152
you just decided to go back?

726
01:11:16,616 --> 01:11:19,486
The gods have foretold,
they have given me you.

727
01:11:21,955 --> 01:11:23,034
me??

728
01:11:26,334 --> 01:11:27,532
I don't understand...

729
01:11:31,089 --> 01:11:34,458
We will shown the way.
You must have faith.

730
01:11:35,177 --> 01:11:37,750
I do not think the gods
concern themselves to much for me.

731
01:11:38,930 --> 01:11:41,303
The gods know you very well,
Quatermain.

732
01:11:42,643 --> 01:11:44,386
The gods smile upon you

733
01:11:45,395 --> 01:11:48,480
and they know your destiny,
even if you do not.

734
01:12:06,667 --> 01:12:10,036
- What are you two talking about?
- Nothing.

735
01:12:13,466 --> 01:12:15,459
I just try to figure it out

736
01:12:16,970 --> 01:12:18,049
did you?

737
01:12:20,348 --> 01:12:21,546
Actually no.

738
01:12:24,018 --> 01:12:25,726
I think he's sad.

739
01:12:27,939 --> 01:12:31,355
The kind of sadness that keeps him
from sharing his life with others.

740
01:12:35,781 --> 01:12:37,774
In many ways,
He's just like you.

741
01:12:38,784 --> 01:12:40,562
Unable to adapt,

742
01:12:40,995 --> 01:12:43,103
but he does know what to do about it ether.

743
01:12:47,902 --> 01:12:49,347
is that right?

744
01:12:49,962 --> 01:12:52,385
Yes... it is.

745
01:13:11,610 --> 01:13:13,935
You wanted to see me?

746
01:13:14,771 --> 01:13:19,778
I hear: you saw the white man Maitland
without me.

747
01:13:20,244 --> 01:13:21,821
For Why?

748
01:13:23,372 --> 01:13:25,910
I had to feel him again

749
01:13:26,383 --> 01:13:28,655
to see his daughter
more clearly.

750
01:13:28,994 --> 01:13:32,695
So what?
Did you see more clearly?

751
01:13:32,923 --> 01:13:37,550
Oh yes, I feel that she is
still on the way to us.

752
01:13:42,016 --> 01:13:44,637
What happens, Gagool?

753
01:13:45,052 --> 01:13:48,268
A white Man accompany her.

754
01:13:48,923 --> 01:13:50,396
You should fear this man.

755
01:13:50,566 --> 01:13:52,132
- Because?

756
01:13:52,832 --> 01:13:54,332
- That I do not know.

757
01:13:54,404 --> 01:13:58,188
but he will be an obstacle for your desire

758
01:13:58,666 --> 01:14:00,544
So I have to kill him.

759
01:14:00,518 --> 01:14:05,231
Of course, soon you get
what you want, my King.

760
01:14:06,833 --> 01:14:09,655
I hope for you, Gagool.

761
01:14:10,178 --> 01:14:11,787
Yes.

762
01:14:46,441 --> 01:14:48,201
Nice watch, Boss.

763
01:14:48,668 --> 01:14:51,406
Thank you.
It is also your necklace.

764
01:14:52,505 --> 01:14:54,365
Do you want to trade for it?

765
01:14:54,382 --> 01:14:56,856
My dear Khiva,
this watch was given to me...

766
01:14:56,735 --> 01:14:59,658
by Her Majesty on my retirement,
It is very special.

767
01:14:59,738 --> 01:15:01,798
Oh, this is too.

768
01:15:05,468 --> 01:15:08,869
very well... it's a deal.

769
01:15:18,532 --> 01:15:22,750
This is beautiful. What does it stand for?

770
01:15:22,753 --> 01:15:23,947
I do not know.

771
01:15:24,163 --> 01:15:27,448
I bought in a souvenir shop
in Cape Town.

772
01:15:34,865 --> 01:15:35,596
ehh Khiva ...

773
01:15:35,758 --> 01:15:38,878
How far do you think it is
before we get to the tomb?

774
01:15:39,637 --> 01:15:41,179
It's hard to say.

775
01:15:42,223 --> 01:15:46,407
- What do you think the cobra represent?
- A marker...

776
01:15:46,978 --> 01:15:49,218
Hopefully, the entrance to the mines.

777
01:15:49,289 --> 01:15:51,513
I don't understand. A cobra?

778
01:15:51,582 --> 01:15:54,549
I do ... an actual monument,

779
01:15:55,028 --> 01:15:57,168
a geological rock formation,

780
01:15:57,447 --> 01:16:00,070
or... it could be a warning.

781
01:16:00,992 --> 01:16:02,617
a warning for what?

782
01:16:03,036 --> 01:16:04,844
I do not know.
But we'll find out.

783
01:16:09,167 --> 01:16:13,034
These tracks are fresh...
not more then an hour ahead.

784
01:16:13,071 --> 01:16:14,082
good

785
01:16:21,556 --> 01:16:23,755
How long, Sir Henry?
That's piracy!

786
01:16:44,496 --> 01:16:45,871
Quatermain!

787
01:16:46,247 --> 01:16:47,327
Look!

788
01:17:04,558 --> 01:17:06,300
aah be there...

789
01:17:31,302 --> 01:17:33,394
so This is the Cobra's head,

790
01:17:34,964 --> 01:17:36,889
but there is not much else.

791
01:17:37,425 --> 01:17:40,083
We have get what the hell we lookup for.

792
01:17:50,438 --> 01:17:53,742
We should have ridden those horses
until they die....

793
01:17:54,526 --> 01:17:56,735
The vultures would have given us a way

794
01:17:57,112 --> 01:17:58,687
Bloody idiot.

795
01:18:01,950 --> 01:18:03,148
McNabb!

796
01:18:05,662 --> 01:18:07,972
I think maybe you do not want
us to catch up?.

797
01:18:08,707 --> 01:18:10,864
I think maybe you are with Quatermain.

798
01:18:13,921 --> 01:18:15,036
go ahead...

799
01:18:15,506 --> 01:18:18,297
And when the wind comes up
and close these tracks away,

800
01:18:18,366 --> 01:18:20,767
You wander around in this desert
and get together lost ,

801
01:18:22,096 --> 01:18:24,801
until the vultures come
and pick out eye balls.

802
01:18:29,353 --> 01:18:30,929
Go on now...

803
01:18:38,571 --> 01:18:40,331
No have to point a gun of me

804
01:19:11,772 --> 01:19:15,507
- For the ancestors, you know.
- For you, Sir Henry,

805
01:19:15,784 --> 01:19:20,597
who has the foresight to pack
a necessity of all necessities. Whiskey.

806
01:19:20,872 --> 01:19:23,623
- Yes, same right back at you, Admiral.
- Captain.

807
01:19:23,784 --> 01:19:27,554
- Congratulations. You just be promoted
- I'll drink to that.

808
01:19:30,091 --> 01:19:33,975
I can't just stand around here
doing nothing, looking at rocks.

809
01:19:34,838 --> 01:19:36,629
We have to do something.

810
01:19:36,881 --> 01:19:40,685
This book explains why
King Solomon hid the Key

811
01:19:40,760 --> 01:19:42,799
in a mine
in the middle of the desert.

812
01:19:43,138 --> 01:19:45,015
It does? What does it say?

813
01:19:48,685 --> 01:19:53,632
it turns out... King Solomon was building

814
01:19:53,606 --> 01:19:55,764
such an incredibly ornate temple,

815
01:19:55,734 --> 01:19:58,272
because he had fallen in love
with a certain queen.

816
01:19:58,821 --> 01:20:00,398
Queen Sheba.

817
01:20:00,739 --> 01:20:04,024
When Sheba traveled to Jerusalem
to meet with Solomon,

818
01:20:05,452 --> 01:20:09,553
They fell in love, completely
passionately.

819
01:20:12,168 --> 01:20:14,592
But Sheba's people did not approve.

820
01:20:14,661 --> 01:20:16,418
She was after all an African queen.

821
01:20:17,882 --> 01:20:22,562
And they were so different, came from
such different places.

822
01:20:22,736 --> 01:20:25,254
One steeped culture
and tradition of African...

823
01:20:25,423 --> 01:20:26,634
And, the other one...

824
01:20:27,016 --> 01:20:29,638
So when She went to Africa,

825
01:20:31,729 --> 01:20:34,781
Solomon did not give up,
he was so in love ...

826
01:20:35,483 --> 01:20:40,147
that he sealed mines
and offered the Key to Sheba

827
01:20:41,281 --> 01:20:43,787
in exchange for her becoming his wife.

828
01:20:44,618 --> 01:20:47,194
Actually, he tried to bribe her.

829
01:20:48,705 --> 01:20:50,698
The man was so desperate

830
01:20:51,333 --> 01:20:54,654
that he sent the richest men
to wait for their reply.

831
01:20:54,728 --> 01:20:56,619
And they waited for years

832
01:20:57,631 --> 01:21:00,618
but Sheba can not
bear to leave her people

833
01:21:02,511 --> 01:21:07,305
so Solomon sealed the Key
and returned forever.

834
01:21:08,601 --> 01:21:11,673
What happened to Solomon and Sheba?

835
01:21:11,771 --> 01:21:13,729
They never saw each other again.

836
01:21:18,152 --> 01:21:19,860
Sad.

837
01:21:21,364 --> 01:21:22,479
It is.

838
01:21:26,369 --> 01:21:28,077
I wonder what it's like...

839
01:21:28,705 --> 01:21:31,247
feel so passionate about someone

840
01:21:31,833 --> 01:21:34,290
He would sacrifice everything.

841
01:22:15,378 --> 01:22:17,836
I put my father's life in your hands.

842
01:22:32,187 --> 01:22:34,229
Miss Maitland! You are right?

843
01:22:34,731 --> 01:22:35,810
I think so.

844
01:22:38,617 --> 01:22:40,359
Elizabeth!
You are all right?

845
01:22:48,503 --> 01:22:51,198
I get something.

846
01:23:15,381 --> 01:23:17,008
Tight.

847
01:23:22,864 --> 01:23:24,691
- By the ancestors!

848
01:23:34,434 --> 01:23:35,496
Help me.

849
01:23:45,471 --> 01:23:46,881
No key.

850
01:24:01,896 --> 01:24:04,469
Quatermain! Come here.

851
01:24:04,490 --> 01:24:05,819
Is what?

852
01:24:23,969 --> 01:24:26,675
Henry noo! Do not touch it.

853
01:24:27,397 --> 01:24:28,625
Not touch anything.

854
01:24:45,357 --> 01:24:48,562
Elizabeth? ... Elizabeth?

855
01:24:48,744 --> 01:24:49,489
Not screem.

856
01:25:22,571 --> 01:25:25,496
Captain ... Wake up. Wake up!

857
01:25:26,074 --> 01:25:29,896
- Captain.
- What is? Where am I?

858
01:25:30,927 --> 01:25:34,608
wah...  ahh... okay

859
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:36,625
Where is Elizabeth?

860
01:25:38,504 --> 01:25:40,046
With the Russians.

861
01:25:40,381 --> 01:25:42,126
- The Russians?
- If.

862
01:25:43,342 --> 01:25:46,115
- And there was another man.
- What a man?

863
01:25:47,304 --> 01:25:50,389
Dark hair, dress like you.
A hunter.

864
01:25:52,309 --> 01:25:53,424
McNabb.

865
01:29:12,800 --> 01:29:14,897
Tracks gone west.

866
01:29:15,486 --> 01:29:17,838
If we hurry, we can them
load up everyone!

867
01:29:17,911 --> 01:29:19,460
This is not a good idea.

868
01:29:20,780 --> 01:29:22,399
Why not?

869
01:29:23,276 --> 01:29:24,943
Low of water.

870
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:29,896
If we go hunting them now,
We have no idea how long it takes

871
01:29:30,069 --> 01:29:32,070
Umbopa says the water that way.

872
01:29:32,143 --> 01:29:33,676
We have to find her.

873
01:29:33,643 --> 01:29:36,364
You have the map
and the key to the mines.

874
01:29:37,447 --> 01:29:41,088
you ask me no need to go looking for them,
is them must go looking for us.

875
01:29:41,160 --> 01:29:43,333
But I did not ask you, Henry!

876
01:29:43,504 --> 01:29:45,190
Vent, Khiva, let's move!

877
01:29:45,569 --> 01:29:46,974
- You are not thinking, Allan!

878
01:29:46,946 --> 01:29:49,064
Violence solves nothing.

879
01:29:49,664 --> 01:29:52,364
We must make the girl our first priority!

880
01:29:53,440 --> 01:29:56,709
But we won’t save her if we die of thirst.

881
01:29:57,594 --> 01:30:00,021
The only water in this part of the Desert

882
01:30:00,901 --> 01:30:03,505
It is the oasis at
Queen of Sheba's eye.

883
01:30:04,092 --> 01:30:07,191
Like all creatures,
we must go there to drink.

884
01:30:07,366 --> 01:30:10,264
And so must the men
who got Miss Maitland.

885
01:30:11,444 --> 01:30:13,998
He's right.

886
01:30:20,791 --> 01:30:22,111
Let's move out!

887
01:30:26,675 --> 01:30:28,077
Tell me again Ms Maitland.

888
01:30:28,291 --> 01:30:31,190
I don't know anything.
You're wasting your time.

889
01:30:32,559 --> 01:30:35,741
The map that your father sent you
belongs to the Tsar.

890
01:30:37,200 --> 01:30:38,602
We want it back.

891
01:30:39,645 --> 01:30:41,542
Well, I haven’t got it.

892
01:30:41,475 --> 01:30:43,902
so I supose you have no luck.

893
01:30:45,487 --> 01:30:47,054
and so about you.

894
01:30:47,808 --> 01:30:48,916
Wait.

895
01:30:51,082 --> 01:30:52,389
Wait a minute.

896
01:30:56,634 --> 01:30:58,579
You gave Quatermain the map
don't you?

897
01:30:59,121 --> 01:31:00,487
What if I did?

898
01:31:02,891 --> 01:31:06,037
We were partners once, He and I

899
01:31:07,450 --> 01:31:08,769
you can,t trust him...

900
01:31:11,014 --> 01:31:12,993
you can say what you want...

901
01:31:14,245 --> 01:31:16,673
And you can treat me how you like.

902
01:31:18,016 --> 01:31:20,537
Quatermain is never going
to give you the key.

903
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:22,613
there is a key?

904
01:31:25,806 --> 01:31:28,794
We find Quatermain.
We offer you a deal.

905
01:31:29,702 --> 01:31:32,958
The map and the key
for her life.

906
01:31:33,846 --> 01:31:36,820
- what if he want to do it?
- how did you heard them?

907
01:31:37,574 --> 01:31:39,519
Quatermain is a honourable man.

908
01:31:40,558 --> 01:31:43,037
And is a sucker,
for a beautiful face.

909
01:31:44,619 --> 01:31:48,247
He will trade you for the wealth
of King Solomon's Mines, right?

910
01:31:52,078 --> 01:31:53,991
Let's circle back

911
01:32:56,400 --> 01:33:01,754
And when they come,
you get Miss Maitland back again.

912
01:33:01,831 --> 01:33:03,824
I hope you are right

913
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,918
How far do you think to Sheba's Eye?

914
01:33:25,603 --> 01:33:29,517
I certainly hope you know where to go,
because I am lost.

915
01:33:29,691 --> 01:33:33,902
You won't find the way we got.
It's a large desert.

916
01:33:34,070 --> 01:33:39,988
Don't worry, We'l find Miss Maitland.
You must have faith in the ancestors.

917
01:33:40,158 --> 01:33:42,116
Faith?

918
01:33:47,456 --> 01:33:52,877
You know, for a wise man, you put a
lot of faith in these ancestors.

919
01:33:53,045 --> 01:33:57,090
And for a wise man, you don't put enough!

920
01:34:08,643 --> 01:34:10,019
keep moving!

921
01:34:24,949 --> 01:34:27,405
Do you Pray, Professor?

922
01:34:27,577 --> 01:34:29,368
I do.

923
01:34:33,750 --> 01:34:35,623
You speak English?

924
01:34:36,710 --> 01:34:41,953
I speak any language you need to hear.
I am here to warn you.

925
01:34:43,050 --> 01:34:47,343
you must pray to God!
Pray for your daughter.

926
01:34:47,512 --> 01:34:49,718
What do you talking about?

927
01:34:49,889 --> 01:34:55,512
There are men who want what Twala wants.
They say, it belongs to them.

928
01:34:55,686 --> 01:34:58,142
They have taken your daughter.

929
01:34:58,314 --> 01:35:01,907
If they don't bring her back,
they will take mines.

930
01:35:02,007 --> 01:35:03,307
and if they take the mines...

931
01:35:03,376 --> 01:35:05,693
Why you telling me this,
why not telling to Twala?

932
01:35:08,398 --> 01:35:13,653
Because it seems big change for our people,
but only if she survives.

933
01:35:16,038 --> 01:35:22,076
your daughter's destiny is not written,
there is much spirit about.

934
01:35:24,797 --> 01:35:26,504
I know.

935
01:35:27,674 --> 01:35:29,500
pray that she survives.

936
01:35:30,602 --> 01:35:34,499
or you will never get out of here alive.

937
01:35:34,972 --> 01:35:36,597
Never.

938
01:36:01,372 --> 01:36:03,660
how far ahead are they?

939
01:36:05,542 --> 01:36:08,163
An hour... to the most

940
01:36:14,758 --> 01:36:17,166
I don't think you manage to make it.

941
01:36:34,861 --> 01:36:37,399
We must leave him here.

942
01:36:37,572 --> 01:36:39,777
Give him some water.

943
01:36:39,948 --> 01:36:42,949
Why? Dead men don't drink.

944
01:37:03,094 --> 01:37:05,253
Why do you follow him?

945
01:37:07,849 --> 01:37:10,850
ever hear of march of death?

946
01:37:11,936 --> 01:37:17,310
two years ago, the Tsar ordered 150 of
his men to march all the way across Russia

947
01:37:17,283 --> 01:37:22,061
from St. Petersburg to Vladivostok.
Just for fun.

948
01:37:22,237 --> 01:37:26,567
It was middle of winter.
Suicide, and that they knew it.

949
01:37:26,742 --> 01:37:30,655
But they went. Only one man made it.

950
01:37:32,872 --> 01:37:34,865
And it was him.

951
01:37:41,129 --> 01:37:43,003
Don't waste your bullets.

952
01:37:44,091 --> 01:37:46,760
Miss Maitland, you got no water?

953
01:37:49,304 --> 01:37:53,002
I think you should come back.
- I prefer to die.

954
01:37:52,974 --> 01:37:55,511
If you die so does your father.

955
01:38:14,211 --> 01:38:15,919
Come on.

956
01:38:27,965 --> 01:38:30,122
We must insist.

957
01:38:38,316 --> 01:38:40,390
keep on.

958
01:38:44,354 --> 01:38:47,189
One foot in front the other, Captain.

959
01:39:13,882 --> 01:39:16,124
Look at the captain.

960
01:39:19,261 --> 01:39:22,766
You go to keep move.
- when you keep her.

961
01:39:22,139 --> 01:39:27,478
You must keep moving, Captain. Get up.
- I can't go on now

962
01:39:27,645 --> 01:39:31,724
If you stay here, you die.
- Let me die!

963
01:39:35,985 --> 01:39:40,113
A man of the sea like yourself
is no one to do die in the desert?

964
01:39:40,281 --> 01:39:42,736
You're insult of water.

965
01:39:43,784 --> 01:39:47,517
you boys, fight now.

966
01:40:06,539 --> 01:40:08,162
Water?

967
01:40:11,126 --> 01:40:14,210
I smell water.

968
01:40:18,425 --> 01:40:20,879
I smell water.

969
01:40:22,678 --> 01:40:25,499
Where you go?

970
01:40:47,868 --> 01:40:51,403
crazy English fool,
you have found that water.

971
01:41:34,035 --> 01:41:37,819
They were just here
The sand is still wet.

972
01:41:38,665 --> 01:41:43,125
The tracks lead away
They have gone

973
01:41:43,294 --> 01:41:46,709
- I don't like it
- what can I do

974
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:48,671
We have her.

975
01:42:25,249 --> 01:42:27,704
Drop[ your weapons, Gentlemen.

976
01:42:34,924 --> 01:42:36,881
We are arround you.

977
01:42:42,098 --> 01:42:46,842
I say drop your weapons and let her go.
- Wait.

978
01:42:49,021 --> 01:42:51,725
Listen to me very carefully, Mr Qaterman.

979
01:42:52,566 --> 01:42:57,726
Before I count to ten, you and your men
will walk down to us, very slowly.

980
01:42:57,912 --> 01:43:00,085
Leave your weapons raised
above your head.

981
01:43:01,106 --> 01:43:04,607
If you don't, I will shoot miss Maitland.

982
01:43:04,785 --> 01:43:06,244
have you understood?

983
01:43:06,412 --> 01:43:10,444
The count begins now: one... two...

984
01:43:10,616 --> 01:43:13,073
Don't play games, Mr Quatermain,
he means what he says.

985
01:43:18,189 --> 01:43:21,838
just give us the map and the key.
and we let miss Maitland go.

986
01:43:25,012 --> 01:43:27,384
Eight...
- All right.

987
01:43:28,515 --> 01:43:30,888
I am coming down.

988
01:43:32,436 --> 01:43:35,389
We all coming down
- don't do it!

989
01:43:40,443 --> 01:43:44,657
- I trust in an officer of the tsar
- is a man of his word.

990
01:43:44,730 --> 01:43:48,990
We are soldiers,
Mr Qaterman, not murderers.

991
01:43:58,877 --> 01:44:00,703
I said: drop your weapons!

992
01:44:02,088 --> 01:44:07,426
I will give you what ever you want,
but I will not drop my weapon!

993
01:44:11,931 --> 01:44:16,971
then I will kill her.
It seems then you were in a taff part, Sir.

994
01:44:18,403 --> 01:44:23,495
one trigger pull...
you will never see the key nor the mines.

995
01:44:23,466 --> 01:44:26,232
with that matter you will be dead...

996
01:44:26,602 --> 01:44:28,809
And you lose your lady-friend.

997
01:44:31,773 --> 01:44:37,112
Why you just shoot me? Then that one
blow you to pices while you reload.

998
01:44:37,487 --> 01:44:40,287
I want the map, and I want the key.

999
01:44:43,626 --> 01:44:45,868
As you wish, Sir.

1000
01:44:53,051 --> 01:44:54,510
take it!

1001
01:45:04,020 --> 01:45:09,358
I am sure you understand Mr Quatermain,
we need some distance. Let's move.

1002
01:45:15,447 --> 01:45:18,448
Don't do anything stupid, Miss Maitland.

1003
01:45:26,165 --> 01:45:27,623
Aahh run!

1004
01:45:44,807 --> 01:45:46,467
You are all right?

1005
01:45:55,859 --> 01:45:58,101
vent has been hurt

1006
01:45:59,396 --> 01:46:02,113
It's just my leg boss.

1007
01:46:29,306 --> 01:46:33,885
Your daughter lives,
and continues her journey to our land.

1008
01:46:36,981 --> 01:46:40,099
all this just not make you happy?

1009
01:46:40,275 --> 01:46:44,560
Yea I am happy that she is alive. But I am...

1010
01:46:44,260 --> 01:46:46,860
I'm not happy that she is
come here to save me.

1011
01:46:46,931 --> 01:46:48,920
I should never get her put her live at risk.

1012
01:46:49,320 --> 01:46:51,620
You are right to worry about her.

1013
01:46:52,194 --> 01:46:55,114
Twala is an unpredictable man.

1014
01:46:55,314 --> 01:46:57,714
It is very dangerous that she come here.

1015
01:46:58,292 --> 01:47:03,830
What kind of a father am I, to put my
own daughter in such jeopardy?

1016
01:47:05,973 --> 01:47:08,717
Other the question is:

1017
01:47:09,217 --> 01:47:10,717
What kind of father are you...

1018
01:47:10,791 --> 01:47:13,971
that your daughter would
risk her life to save you?

1019
01:47:17,142 --> 01:47:18,766
Thank you.

1020
01:47:35,367 --> 01:47:37,717
you should never have
traded the key for me.

1021
01:47:37,817 --> 01:47:39,417
- if I hadn't you be dead now.

1022
01:47:39,596 --> 01:47:44,134
He is quite right, Elizabeth.
These men are barbarians.

1023
01:47:45,001 --> 01:47:47,371
They fear for nothing to get to the mines.

1024
01:47:48,046 --> 01:47:52,423
I like to get hold of that McNabb,
and take the map back.

1025
01:47:52,592 --> 01:47:54,963
He is well gone.

1026
01:47:55,135 --> 01:48:00,177
So the next landmark on the map,
are breasts of Sheba.

1027
01:48:00,549 --> 01:48:02,804
What do you suppose there?

1028
01:48:07,021 --> 01:48:08,930
There they are.

1029
01:48:14,320 --> 01:48:18,019
The queen of Sheba's
breasts I believe.

1030
01:48:18,698 --> 01:48:20,715
I haven't ever met a women of thouse.

1031
01:48:22,202 --> 01:48:25,156
Now we have to do
is find McNabb.

1032
01:48:30,084 --> 01:48:33,369
So you say know these mountains?

1033
01:48:33,545 --> 01:48:35,787
Then you take the lead.

1034
01:48:53,564 --> 01:48:58,391
Don't look so worried McNabb.
Quatermain has no idea where we are.

1035
01:49:24,134 --> 01:49:27,585
And this is... Sheba's smile.

1036
01:49:27,762 --> 01:49:31,177
We walk through here
down to Sheba's breasts.

1037
01:49:31,348 --> 01:49:36,259
Sheba's smile.
- not her smile I'm read about.

1038
01:49:36,437 --> 01:49:38,679
its her teeth.

1039
01:50:05,130 --> 01:50:07,087
We are ahead of them now.

1040
01:50:20,218 --> 01:50:22,977
Come to papeims.

1041
01:50:27,359 --> 01:50:30,194
We setup on these rocks.

1042
01:50:31,488 --> 01:50:33,396
Watch your step.

1043
01:50:36,909 --> 01:50:41,950
Khiva, high there, left.
Captain Good, go here.

1044
01:50:42,122 --> 01:50:44,198
V, you stay with me.

1045
01:50:55,718 --> 01:51:01,921
Miss Maitland, If thing go sad,
and I have to move, you stay right here.

1046
01:51:02,299 --> 01:51:04,768
you stay quiet, understand?

1047
01:51:32,085 --> 01:51:33,626
What now?

1048
01:51:36,880 --> 01:51:38,707
Take cover. Right now.

1049
01:51:41,802 --> 01:51:45,467
McNabb, drop the bag and move on!

1050
01:51:49,767 --> 01:51:53,017
All right, take it easy!

1051
01:52:02,012 --> 01:52:05,989
Drop the bag, McNabb, and move on!

1052
01:52:53,534 --> 01:52:55,776
Cover  Quatermain.

1053
01:53:00,374 --> 01:53:02,815
I'll got the bag!

1054
01:53:02,815 --> 01:53:05,815
Khiva noo. What are you going...

1055
01:53:06,087 --> 01:53:06,747
Khiva, ga.

1056
01:53:12,218 --> 01:53:14,543
Cover me, Henry.

1057
01:54:25,368 --> 01:54:27,444
Take a shoot, McNabb.

1058
01:54:32,876 --> 01:54:34,418
Now.

1059
01:55:19,252 --> 01:55:21,743
Let me see.

1060
01:55:23,297 --> 01:55:25,622
It is good.

1061
01:55:29,302 --> 01:55:34,178
You'll be fine, Khiva,

1062
01:55:34,349 --> 01:55:36,555
is fine...

1063
01:55:42,790 --> 01:55:45,062
don't ... don't to die please....

1064
01:56:43,996 --> 01:56:49,037
gods of the Earth, Sun and Stars.

1065
01:56:50,169 --> 01:56:55,957
take our brother and
make from his body a great tree.

1066
01:56:56,132 --> 01:57:01,690
Let it be a reflection, on what
Khiva's life was on this earth.

1067
01:57:41,590 --> 01:57:44,876
- May I join you?
- sure

1068
01:57:53,185 --> 01:57:55,177
I could not sleep.

1069
01:57:56,271 --> 01:57:58,892
I kept thinking about Khiva.

1070
01:58:01,776 --> 01:58:03,270
Me too.

1071
01:58:05,280 --> 01:58:10,403
When I was a little girl, my mother died.

1072
01:58:13,745 --> 01:58:17,743
I was so confused, and frightened.

1073
01:58:21,752 --> 01:58:27,343
right after her funeral my father came
to my room to comfort me.

1074
01:58:29,802 --> 01:58:35,008
He told me that my mother's spirit
would be always with us.

1075
01:58:36,099 --> 01:58:42,222
to prove his point he take to me outland,
carried me outside and...

1076
01:58:42,097 --> 01:58:45,644
we lay on the ground
anf looked at the stars.

1077
01:58:47,026 --> 01:58:50,810
He pointed to one, and he said:

1078
01:58:52,031 --> 01:58:56,442
Every time, God closes the door on life ...

1079
01:58:57,869 --> 01:59:00,739
He opens a window into heaven.

1080
01:59:00,914 --> 01:59:04,080
So let the Light shine down forever.

1081
01:59:07,169 --> 01:59:08,960
that's lovely.

1082
01:59:12,007 --> 01:59:14,249
It helped.

1083
01:59:39,032 --> 01:59:42,615
What is, Quatermain?
- Umbopa is gone.

1084
01:59:42,786 --> 01:59:46,450
No tracks, sign, nothing,
... just disappear.

1085
01:59:47,790 --> 01:59:49,581
What do you think?

1086
01:59:51,710 --> 01:59:53,454
I do not know.

1087
01:59:54,588 --> 01:59:57,754
Maybe just go home?

1088
01:59:57,924 --> 02:00:00,794
I make a fire, make some coffee.

1089
02:00:02,095 --> 02:00:04,052
common, wake up.

1090
02:00:18,277 --> 02:00:20,068
Give me the knife.

1091
02:00:21,946 --> 02:00:24,900
We are partners now, you and me.

1092
02:00:25,074 --> 02:00:26,901
I'll do it.

1093
02:00:31,330 --> 02:00:36,371
It is not about the money, McNabb.

1094
02:00:37,168 --> 02:00:39,660
I want the stone of the ancesters.

1095
02:00:41,590 --> 02:00:44,425
you won't believe a stone
as an evil power?

1096
02:00:44,593 --> 02:00:46,894
I am here for the tsar.

1097
02:00:47,494 --> 02:00:50,994
He believes that the tribes
of Africa believe it as power.

1098
02:00:51,164 --> 02:00:52,674
That is enough.

1099
02:00:54,101 --> 02:00:56,473
bite on this.

1100
02:00:56,645 --> 02:00:58,879
And hold still!

1101
02:00:59,647 --> 02:01:02,185
There is ... there is ...

1102
02:01:38,600 --> 02:01:40,376
What is it, Quatermain?

1103
02:01:50,352 --> 02:01:52,192
Don't move.

1104
02:01:55,449 --> 02:01:58,782
You don't suppose
there Cannibals?

1105
02:02:05,583 --> 02:02:08,253
What did they want?
- I do not know.

1106
02:02:33,150 --> 02:02:36,269
Maybe this is the tribe holding my father.

1107
02:02:47,163 --> 02:02:52,224
- I am afraid it's getting back to worse.
- get a lot worse for you, McNabb.

1108
02:02:53,836 --> 02:02:56,243
Just a hit, I will release him from sufferings.

1109
02:02:56,422 --> 02:02:59,127
We are the ones, who care about killing.

1110
02:02:59,258 --> 02:03:01,195
I will save you the trouble.

1111
02:03:20,802 --> 02:03:23,120
my people: the Kuakuani's...
review me carefully.

1112
02:03:24,772 --> 02:03:28,211
I am Ignosi...

1113
02:03:29,911 --> 02:03:32,152
...you legitimate King.

1114
02:03:32,330 --> 02:03:34,038
What is he saying?

1115
02:03:35,124 --> 02:03:37,579
Umbopa says, he is the is king.

1116
02:03:37,751 --> 02:03:39,542
Umbopa the King?

1117
02:03:40,553 --> 02:03:42,754
you don't remember me anymore?

1118
02:03:43,323 --> 02:03:45,414
When I was a little boy...

1119
02:03:45,692 --> 02:03:48,130
My mother and me, we left our home.

1120
02:03:48,303 --> 02:03:50,460
How can I believe you?

1121
02:03:50,538 --> 02:03:52,200
a mother with her kid should

1122
02:03:52,200 --> 02:03:54,438
cross the big desert?

1123
02:03:54,517 --> 02:03:57,203
Yea. And I returned...

1124
02:03:57,303 --> 02:04:01,203
in order to claim my throne.

1125
02:04:01,281 --> 02:04:05,168
Twala killed my father

1126
02:04:05,668 --> 02:04:09,068
and robbed me of my rights!

1127
02:04:11,324 --> 02:04:13,662
There is only one proof for You

1128
02:04:13,762 --> 02:04:16,862
to show: that you are your father's son.

1129
02:04:19,498 --> 02:04:22,368
This is proof which you are asking for

1130
02:04:28,422 --> 02:04:32,088
Why are you protecting these whites?

1131
02:04:33,970 --> 02:04:38,927
They are my guardians and servants.

1132
02:04:39,099 --> 02:04:40,890
And these two...

1133
02:04:41,059 --> 02:04:43,099
are my slaves.

1134
02:04:50,317 --> 02:04:54,421
I am nobody's slave.
- what is it some kind of a joke?

1135
02:04:53,696 --> 02:04:56,021
crouch down.

1136
02:04:56,198 --> 02:05:00,741
The Kuakuani's will kill any
intruder to her land.

1137
02:05:01,996 --> 02:05:07,784
If you want to live, you must do what I say.

1138
02:05:19,803 --> 02:05:21,630
drop down.

1139
02:05:32,607 --> 02:05:36,900
Ignosi, our king is returned.

1140
02:06:05,386 --> 02:06:08,553
Is perfect. They will lead us right there.

1141
02:06:11,643 --> 02:06:14,181
where do you think they take us to?

1142
02:06:14,354 --> 02:06:18,481
we’re go meet the man
who killed Umbopa's father

1143
02:06:18,649 --> 02:06:22,481
Twala?
- Ay, seems like that.

1144
02:06:22,653 --> 02:06:25,938
I am sorry for not telling
you about my birth sooner.

1145
02:06:26,114 --> 02:06:27,906
Why didn't you?

1146
02:06:28,075 --> 02:06:32,949
I was not sure if you would come
with me to this place.

1147
02:06:33,120 --> 02:06:35,493
Well Wait...

1148
02:06:36,582 --> 02:06:39,883
So you planed this all along?

1149
02:06:39,952 --> 02:06:43,583
The gods have foretold that
you would help me to be king.

1150
02:06:43,755 --> 02:06:48,664
In exchange I will help you
to find this place

1151
02:06:48,735 --> 02:06:51,091
Trade is my father come into this?

1152
02:06:51,263 --> 02:06:55,473
M'Lenge has told me Twala
holds a white man in prison.

1153
02:06:55,641 --> 02:07:00,550
He is still alive.
When I am King, he will be free.

1154
02:07:01,814 --> 02:07:03,937
What if you don't become king?

1155
02:07:05,025 --> 02:07:08,059
Quatermain, may I have the key?

1156
02:07:19,538 --> 02:07:21,577
What are you doing?

1157
02:07:21,748 --> 02:07:25,995
This key is the only thing I have
to help my father.

1158
02:07:26,170 --> 02:07:31,673
The key is all I have to win
my birthright and defeat Twala.

1159
02:07:33,301 --> 02:07:36,919
Twala is a cruel king, Miss Maitland.

1160
02:07:37,096 --> 02:07:40,263
He kills people and steal their land.

1161
02:07:42,142 --> 02:07:47,267
If you give him to the key...
he'll find the stone of the ancestors.

1162
02:07:47,439 --> 02:07:50,890
And the stone will give him
the power to talk to the gods.

1163
02:07:51,067 --> 02:07:55,147
If that happens,
there will be no stop again.

1164
02:07:58,532 --> 02:08:01,652
I think we can trust him, Elizabeth.

1165
02:09:32,326 --> 02:09:34,284
We met under the force of the Sun ...

1166
02:09:36,706 --> 02:09:40,324
to celebrate the power of the Kuakuani's .

1167
02:09:40,936 --> 02:09:45,120
there you see the white man.

1168
02:09:47,048 --> 02:09:49,753
full of lies and deceit.

1169
02:09:49,926 --> 02:09:51,883
This man...

1170
02:09:52,053 --> 02:09:55,138
lied against your king.

1171
02:10:09,736 --> 02:10:12,737
This is not a good time for a sacrifice.

1172
02:10:13,006 --> 02:10:15,444
He did not bring what he has promised.

1173
02:10:15,617 --> 02:10:17,194
The ancestors tell me...

1174
02:10:17,368 --> 02:10:20,868
that the key be brought to us soon.

1175
02:10:21,039 --> 02:10:22,995
Have patience, my king.

1176
02:10:23,165 --> 02:10:26,166
The time of patience is over.

1177
02:10:30,964 --> 02:10:32,921
Kill him.

1178
02:10:55,036 --> 02:10:56,945
Who dares...

1179
02:10:58,072 --> 02:11:00,823
to disturb this celebration?

1180
02:11:27,724 --> 02:11:33,597
who dare to disturb this celebration?

1181
02:11:37,608 --> 02:11:43,444
I am Ignosi, the rightful King.

1182
02:11:44,824 --> 02:11:47,907
You are a deceiver.

1183
02:11:49,411 --> 02:11:53,076
kill them.

1184
02:12:02,715 --> 02:12:05,122
there is no reason for violence.

1185
02:12:06,510 --> 02:12:09,926
My father was Cohadi, your king.

1186
02:12:10,097 --> 02:12:12,670
The father Twala has killed him.

1187
02:12:12,849 --> 02:12:14,972
My mother fled with me into the desert

1188
02:12:15,343 --> 02:12:17,550
Now I am back home.

1189
02:12:18,271 --> 02:12:20,643
You are telling that you are the king.

1190
02:12:22,192 --> 02:12:23,769
who can confirm this?

1191
02:12:23,942 --> 02:12:26,019
I remember his father

1192
02:12:26,419 --> 02:12:28,719
and I know, Ignosi is our king.

1193
02:12:29,198 --> 02:12:31,155
An old man.

1194
02:12:32,910 --> 02:12:35,652
I have thousands of warriors

1195
02:12:35,752 --> 02:12:38,152
which say that I am king.

1196
02:12:40,666 --> 02:12:44,035
You know the will of the ancestors.

1197
02:12:51,092 --> 02:12:54,827
The key Umbopa, give Twala the key.

1198
02:12:56,556 --> 02:12:58,427
The daughter of the white man

1199
02:12:58,127 --> 02:12:59,527
has brought the key.

1200
02:12:59,601 --> 02:13:03,051
I give Gagool the key to keep...

1201
02:13:03,229 --> 02:13:06,348
until we have decided who becomes king.

1202
02:13:06,524 --> 02:13:09,359
And you let free the white man.

1203
02:13:22,372 --> 02:13:25,288
I claim the throne from you to.

1204
02:13:25,457 --> 02:13:29,537
I request Nomolos, fight to live and death

1205
02:13:41,139 --> 02:13:46,346
You may choose one man to fight for you
I choose one of my slaves to fight for me

1206
02:13:47,687 --> 02:13:51,814
Who is left the live at the end
his master shall be king

1207
02:14:40,818 --> 02:14:43,107
where is Elizabeth?

1208
02:14:43,279 --> 02:14:46,529
She is preparing the food,
with the other service.

1209
02:14:52,704 --> 02:14:57,033
What do they want with us?
- Your heads on a stake.

1210
02:14:57,209 --> 02:15:02,084
You know at this stage
I don't care much.

1211
02:15:02,255 --> 02:15:04,876
just a long sit right beside yours.

1212
02:15:09,178 --> 02:15:11,217
Give me your weapons.

1213
02:15:18,937 --> 02:15:21,392
That means you do, soldier.

1214
02:15:37,996 --> 02:15:39,870
Everyone else.

1215
02:16:08,107 --> 02:16:13,065
That white man, Quatermain...
he is the one?

1216
02:16:17,824 --> 02:16:21,444
Give it to me.
- What is that my king?

1217
02:16:21,119 --> 02:16:23,444
Give me the key to the mine

1218
02:16:23,663 --> 02:16:26,997
If your warrior wins Nomolos ...
- I want it.

1219
02:16:30,419 --> 02:16:35,295
My king, will be wise not test my magic

1220
02:17:00,989 --> 02:17:05,117
Let's see how they use it.
- You are making a big mistake.

1221
02:17:05,285 --> 02:17:08,675
All right... I agree

1222
02:17:09,747 --> 02:17:13,330
at my view, the string is
brought up by the neck

1223
02:17:13,501 --> 02:17:18,327
But Umbopa is a compassionate man,
do you have a good night sleep.

1224
02:17:23,009 --> 02:17:27,603
of course, I hope the mosquitoes
bite a million holding you

1225
02:17:30,016 --> 02:17:33,633
If you are hungry, you can just
bite each others noses open.

1226
02:17:33,811 --> 02:17:35,518
Shut off.

1227
02:17:45,822 --> 02:17:47,980
I feel so ashamed.

1228
02:17:49,659 --> 02:17:55,245
Father, you have nothing to be ashamed of.
- I should never written that letter.

1229
02:17:57,707 --> 02:18:00,792
But I was afraid, Elizabeth.

1230
02:18:02,129 --> 02:18:04,798
I know, I understand.

1231
02:18:04,965 --> 02:18:10,634
I thought it would... buy me time
give me a chance to escape.

1232
02:18:13,389 --> 02:18:19,391
I should never send it
if you hadn’t sent it, I wouldn't be here now.

1233
02:18:19,561 --> 02:18:25,147
...and I put you, and those men
who helped you, into such danger.

1234
02:18:35,284 --> 02:18:38,487
Hello Sir, it's really good to see you.

1235
02:18:39,955 --> 02:18:42,660
I can not thank you enough, Allan

1236
02:18:44,709 --> 02:18:46,452
is anything all right?

1237
02:18:47,670 --> 02:18:51,086
Twala has chosen his warrier
to fight for him.

1238
02:18:51,257 --> 02:18:54,591
And what about Umbopa?
Who is going to fight for him?

1239
02:21:14,889 --> 02:21:17,558
Now is the time...

1240
02:21:17,725 --> 02:21:21,509
For Nomolos.

1241
02:21:21,687 --> 02:21:26,728
a battle to the death.

1242
02:21:26,900 --> 02:21:31,443
Only one of them will survive...

1243
02:21:31,613 --> 02:21:34,898
and his master will king.

1244
02:22:22,576 --> 02:22:25,362
This is not your fight.

1245
02:22:26,788 --> 02:22:31,865
I am going give you one more chance
to walk away. Take all whites and leave.

1246
02:22:32,043 --> 02:22:34,119
I won't harm you.

1247
02:22:34,295 --> 02:22:36,786
And Umbopa, what about him ?

1248
02:22:39,550 --> 02:22:43,250
I'll deal with Umbopa
in my own way.

1249
02:22:43,429 --> 02:22:46,133
and I will fight, as agreed.

1250
02:22:47,683 --> 02:22:49,509
Then you are a fool.

1251
02:22:51,811 --> 02:22:57,267
take your weapon...
and fight my warrior, as agreed.

1252
02:22:57,442 --> 02:22:59,849
Or I will kill you myself.

1253
02:25:10,313 --> 02:25:12,271
cut me down.

1254
02:25:13,608 --> 02:25:15,518
cut me down.

1255
02:25:55,855 --> 02:25:59,473
Kill the white devil.

1256
02:26:36,684 --> 02:26:39,970
Come on,  Quatermain. Do it.

1257
02:28:08,143 --> 02:28:10,219
is too late.

1258
02:28:15,150 --> 02:28:18,733
buy an option now
for the rest way of course.

1259
02:28:18,904 --> 02:28:22,022
You rely on all your dream which you need.

1260
02:28:22,907 --> 02:28:26,655
tell he Umbopa he's a noble king.

1261
02:28:26,827 --> 02:28:30,907
And you need the good girl.

1262
02:28:32,582 --> 02:28:35,120
Don't ... Please, don't die.

1263
02:29:00,149 --> 02:29:05,025
Quatermain...
Noo stop fight.

1264
02:29:07,156 --> 02:29:08,781
Trust me.

1265
02:29:39,269 --> 02:29:40,893
I got it.

1266
02:29:56,827 --> 02:30:01,037
Go ahead... What?
Not look at her.

1267
02:30:01,205 --> 02:30:02,913
I'm not afraid of a witch.

1268
02:30:07,253 --> 02:30:09,744
I am not afraid of your magic.

1269
02:30:10,839 --> 02:30:13,508
I am an officer of the tsar.

1270
02:30:15,302 --> 02:30:19,252
I will hold your look... as long as I want...

1271
02:30:22,350 --> 02:30:23,974
You do not intimidate me...

1272
02:30:27,271 --> 02:30:29,560
Get a breath.

1273
02:30:38,364 --> 02:30:40,024
and again.

1274
02:30:43,078 --> 02:30:44,572
Now stop breathing.

1275
02:31:13,188 --> 02:31:14,896
Look at me.

1276
02:31:18,568 --> 02:31:21,238
Look at me.

1277
02:31:28,202 --> 02:31:32,282
Your friend search
the stone of the ancesters.

1278
02:31:33,374 --> 02:31:36,426
You do not. Why?

1279
02:31:38,878 --> 02:31:41,454
I do not seek power over African people.

1280
02:31:41,631 --> 02:31:45,757
You seek wealth ... which
in the end gives you power.

1281
02:31:47,887 --> 02:31:51,587
You are wise.
- you are flat to me.

1282
02:31:54,601 --> 02:31:59,878
The white who fights for Ignosi
you can not trust him.

1283
02:32:02,734 --> 02:32:05,059
He envy him.

1284
02:32:05,236 --> 02:32:09,068
So long as he envy him,
you must follow him.

1285
02:32:11,367 --> 02:32:13,240
Go.

1286
02:32:13,410 --> 02:32:15,735
Your journey does not end here.

1287
02:32:27,006 --> 02:32:30,007
will I find what I seek?
- Yes.

1288
02:32:32,970 --> 02:32:35,591
But you can never possess it.

1289
02:33:18,512 --> 02:33:20,588
The toast...

1290
02:33:22,933 --> 02:33:25,091
to Sir Henry.

1291
02:33:41,491 --> 02:33:43,531
Sir Henry.

1292
02:33:43,702 --> 02:33:48,862
The wildest, bravest, most
reverend crazy of all fool ever lived.

1293
02:33:58,549 --> 02:34:00,791
and my friend.

1294
02:34:38,335 --> 02:34:43,127
I am here to serve you, my King
If you will have me.

1295
02:34:43,882 --> 02:34:46,373
I must tell about Gagool.

1296
02:34:46,551 --> 02:34:49,754
When I was held by Twala...

1297
02:34:49,929 --> 02:34:53,594
this woman was the only person
to show me any compassion.

1298
02:34:57,394 --> 02:34:59,636
You may sit with us.

1299
02:35:31,425 --> 02:35:34,130
I know you done much for me...

1300
02:35:34,303 --> 02:35:37,257
But I have one final favor to ask.

1301
02:35:37,731 --> 02:35:41,546
As long as men are interested in the
power of the stone of the ancestors...

1302
02:35:41,518 --> 02:35:46,725
my people will not be safe...
It must be destroyed.

1303
02:35:46,898 --> 02:35:51,774
You want me to destroy the stone?
- that is so.

1304
02:35:51,945 --> 02:35:56,570
of the ancestors.
- You have a strong voice will bring you.

1305
02:35:57,991 --> 02:36:01,574
Listen. Trust.

1306
02:36:01,745 --> 02:36:04,532
You will find what you seek.

1307
02:37:07,680 --> 02:37:10,218
Here we go.

1308
02:37:10,391 --> 02:37:12,348
well I can go not further.

1309
02:37:14,103 --> 02:37:15,930
I understand.

1310
02:37:47,509 --> 02:37:49,252
Beware.

1311
02:38:25,877 --> 02:38:29,729
Not to believe. After all that time.

1312
02:38:30,549 --> 02:38:33,632
King Solomon
and the queen of Sheba.

1313
02:38:43,936 --> 02:38:45,726
Hold.

1314
02:39:00,367 --> 02:39:02,324
stay behind me.

1315
02:39:11,753 --> 02:39:13,496
don't move

1316
02:39:24,765 --> 02:39:28,268
now we gone go .. for a nice little walk.

1317
02:39:32,364 --> 02:39:33,390
That's nett.

1318
02:39:34,982 --> 02:39:37,224
one Step at a time.

1319
02:39:44,033 --> 02:39:46,025
This way.

1320
02:39:48,578 --> 02:39:50,238
forward.

1321
02:40:08,764 --> 02:40:11,336
so what we gona do... shoot each other?

1322
02:40:13,351 --> 02:40:17,016
You got the key,
the mines are yours.

1323
02:40:17,188 --> 02:40:19,940
But that is not what you want, is it?

1324
02:40:20,108 --> 02:40:22,184
You want a piece of me.

1325
02:40:27,489 --> 02:40:30,443
It's what this is is all about, isn't it?

1326
02:40:35,455 --> 02:40:37,743
so here is your chance.

1327
02:40:55,056 --> 02:40:57,013
so What, McNabb?

1328
02:40:58,226 --> 02:41:01,226
what you gone to do Shoot me
with my own gun?

1329
02:41:41,098 --> 02:41:42,890
come on.

1330
02:43:26,988 --> 02:43:28,529
incredible.

1331
02:43:36,246 --> 02:43:39,946
This speaks of the stone of the ancestors.

1332
02:43:40,124 --> 02:43:42,994
And the king Solomon's desire to

1333
02:43:43,694 --> 02:43:46,294
unite the tribes of the
world into one kingdom.

1334
02:43:56,514 --> 02:44:00,464
This one speaks of his love
for the queen Sheba.

1335
02:44:12,029 --> 02:44:14,152
We Will?

1336
02:44:40,430 --> 02:44:41,971
Wait wait.

1337
02:44:42,139 --> 02:44:46,654
It's not clever hasty.
- Ok. After you.

1338
02:44:49,480 --> 02:44:51,936
There might be ambush.

1339
02:44:59,155 --> 02:45:02,275
Well, here it is.

1340
02:45:02,909 --> 02:45:05,032
The stone of the ancestors.

1341
02:45:30,434 --> 02:45:32,510
take it slow.

1342
02:46:03,298 --> 02:46:06,071
There is only one way to find out

1343
02:46:43,459 --> 02:46:46,164
I should known.

1344
02:46:55,054 --> 02:46:57,861
You're not much of a talker, are you

1345
02:47:01,685 --> 02:47:07,936
Marie and I used to...
talk about hopes and dreams, and the farm.

1346
02:47:08,436 --> 02:47:10,836
we would talk all night all about nothing

1347
02:47:12,403 --> 02:47:15,854
This is the first time
I heard you mention her name.

1348
02:47:16,949 --> 02:47:19,025
Oh, I don't know, I did ...

1349
02:47:19,201 --> 02:47:23,070
I am sorry. If you don't want
to talk about anything, and

1350
02:47:23,070 --> 02:47:27,070
if you prefer to insist there, that's fine too.

1351
02:47:28,876 --> 02:47:32,576
is nice I have someone to talk to.

1352
02:47:36,300 --> 02:47:41,208
Actually I've ... thinking that ....

1353
02:47:43,682 --> 02:47:47,680
If you know, we got here ...

1354
02:47:47,551 --> 02:47:51,219
I might ask you about if you...

1355
02:47:52,398 --> 02:47:56,399
want to be with me. Because...

1356
02:47:58,194 --> 02:48:01,030
I will not want everything will go away...

1357
02:48:02,449 --> 02:48:06,267
I never feel again the way
I feel so happy with you.

1358
02:48:11,457 --> 02:48:14,991
So I was... thinking that...

1359
02:48:18,797 --> 02:48:23,793
If I had .. ask you to marry me...

1360
02:48:25,219 --> 02:48:27,592
what might you said?

1361
02:48:30,332 --> 02:48:32,803
I might say yes.

1362
02:48:35,479 --> 02:48:37,187
Really?

1363
02:48:40,651 --> 02:48:42,608
Really.

1364
02:48:46,947 --> 02:48:51,231
will you... marry... me?

1365
02:48:52,662 --> 02:48:54,784
Yes.

1366
02:48:57,041 --> 02:48:58,664
I will.

1367
02:48:59,751 --> 02:49:01,993
My god so I will kiss you.

1368
02:49:04,339 --> 02:49:06,545
Kiss me.

1369
02:49:24,023 --> 02:49:26,728
This is so much better than talking.

1370
02:49:34,784 --> 02:49:37,321
I could make it official.

1371
02:49:42,191 --> 02:49:45,959
like... I wish I had a ring or something

1372
02:49:47,045 --> 02:49:49,831
The Queen of Sheba has a ring.

1373
02:49:59,098 --> 02:50:02,680
The ring...
- it's what we try.

1374
02:50:41,511 --> 02:50:44,071
Hurry, hurry, get up there.

1375
02:51:08,244 --> 02:51:10,914
give room to Stone. Throw it.

1376
02:51:15,918 --> 02:51:17,661
Now go.

1377
02:51:19,655 --> 02:51:21,513

1378
02:51:30,848 --> 02:51:33,007
