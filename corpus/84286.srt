1
00:01:01,928 --> 00:01:04,488
Woman's voice: All my life,
all I ever wanted to be

2
00:01:04,531 --> 00:01:07,022
was a rock and roll star.

3
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:12,562
# Sixty-one-forty-one
Afton Place was my home #

4
00:01:12,639 --> 00:01:15,506
# Junkies, thieves,
rednecks and queens #

5
00:01:15,542 --> 00:01:18,136
# Rock and roll stars
and freaks like me #

6
00:01:23,516 --> 00:01:26,508
# I tried to leave this place
where the sidewalk screams #

7
00:01:26,553 --> 00:01:29,317
# And the courtyard's
littered with broken dreams #

8
00:01:29,355 --> 00:01:32,290
# But those dirty, dirty angels
keep on pulling me in #

9
00:01:32,325 --> 00:01:35,590
# Promising me more
of nefarious sin #

10
00:01:35,628 --> 00:01:37,994
Woman's voice: I was this dorky
seventh grader from the Valley

11
00:01:38,031 --> 00:01:40,056
when I had my first
cool experience.

12
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,625
My boyfriend, Johnny Miller,
had his dad drive us to see

13
00:01:42,702 --> 00:01:45,102
Ike and Tina Turner
at the Hollywood Bowl.

14
00:01:45,138 --> 00:01:47,698
Oh, man.
She scared the shit out of me!

15
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:50,800
It was the most bad-assed thing
I'd ever seen a woman do.

16
00:01:50,877 --> 00:01:55,439
Suddenly, the idea of becoming
a teacher or a nurse lost its edge.

17
00:01:55,482 --> 00:01:56,881
Sorry, Mom.

18
00:01:57,884 --> 00:02:03,015
# 35 flew by
near Sunset and Vine #

19
00:02:03,056 --> 00:02:06,219
# I'm not getting any younger #

20
00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:09,456
# Hollywood is killing me,
this town's a motherfucker #

21
00:02:13,933 --> 00:02:16,959
# I tried to leave this place
where the sidewalk screams #

22
00:02:17,036 --> 00:02:19,971
# And the courtyard's
littered with broken dreams #

23
00:02:20,006 --> 00:02:23,134
# But those dirty, dirty angels
keep on pulling me in #

24
00:02:23,176 --> 00:02:26,339
# Promising me more
of my very sin #

25
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:29,507
Woman's voice: The second after
I'd got my driver's license,

26
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:32,143
I grabbed my fake I.D.,
jumped into my Pinto,

27
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:34,346
and headed straight over
the hill to Hollywood.

28
00:02:36,956 --> 00:02:41,416
I saw the band X at The Whiskey,
and I fell in love with Punk Rock.

29
00:02:41,461 --> 00:02:44,897
I left that show knowing
I had to have my own band.

30
00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:48,560
So I got an electric guitar,
learned three chords,

31
00:02:48,635 --> 00:02:51,035
and cons some chicks
into starting a band with me.

32
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:53,561
That was 20 years ago.

33
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:57,667
Today, and God knows how many
bands later, not much has changed.

34
00:02:57,744 --> 00:03:01,703
Not the gigs, not the clubs,
not the money.

35
00:03:01,748 --> 00:03:04,979
# I tried to leave this place
where the sidewalk screams #

36
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:07,680
# And the courtyard's
littered with broken dreams #

37
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,814
# But those dirty, dirty angels
keep on pullin' me in #

38
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:13,917
# Promising me more
of nefarious sin #

39
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,895
( crowd shouting )

40
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:18,397
# My favorite sin #

41
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:23,164
Tonight, we made
$13.50 each.

42
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:26,433
Not even enough
to support my eyeliner habit.

43
00:03:28,274 --> 00:03:31,402
Lady with a baby,
make a hole.

44
00:03:31,444 --> 00:03:36,381
And what lucky ladies get to share
this glamorous life with me?

45
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:39,575
Let me introduce you to my band.

46
00:03:40,587 --> 00:03:45,251
That's Faith. Guitar God by night,
guitar teacher by day.

47
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:48,886
Oh, man,
she loves her guitar!

48
00:03:48,928 --> 00:03:52,989
I think she only stopped sleeping with
it when she started sleeping with Sally.

49
00:03:53,032 --> 00:03:56,695
That's Sally.
Hmm, let's see.

50
00:03:56,769 --> 00:04:00,261
If Shirley Temple and Keith Moon
had a love child,

51
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:03,036
she would definitely be Sally.

52
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,271
You need help with that, missy?

53
00:04:05,311 --> 00:04:08,246
Oh, yeah.
That beautiful mess is Tracy.

54
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:11,273
Lucky for her,
she's a trust fund baby.

55
00:04:11,317 --> 00:04:14,150
And a great bass player.

56
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:16,280
What did I say about the feet?

57
00:04:21,127 --> 00:04:23,186
Oh, this is Jessica.

58
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:24,321
Hey.

59
00:04:24,364 --> 00:04:25,797
It must be Friday.

60
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:28,266
- Hey.
- Am I going to see you later on?

61
00:04:28,334 --> 00:04:29,824
Yeah. I'll call you.

62
00:04:29,902 --> 00:04:31,130
Jacki...

63
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:34,901
don't say you're going to call me
unless you're going to call me, okay?

64
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:38,138
- I will see you later.
- All right.

65
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:48,181
See you later.
Let me just finish up here.

66
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:50,155
Fine.

67
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:56,526
Chicks.

68
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:11,668
I spent over20 years living, breathing,
fucking, sucking, eating, sleeping,

69
00:05:11,711 --> 00:05:14,509
and dreaming
all things rock and roll.

70
00:05:14,547 --> 00:05:17,607
It never occurred to me
that I might not make it.

71
00:05:19,352 --> 00:05:23,288
So, did I really want to be
slugging it out in little clubs,

72
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:27,521
still chasing that rock and roll dream
when I was 45?

73
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,358
50? How about fucking 60?

74
00:05:30,396 --> 00:05:34,093
I mean, at what point
do I become a joke?

75
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,440
In two days I'll be 40.

76
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:47,105
And surprise, surprise,
I ain't no rock star.

77
00:05:47,146 --> 00:05:50,912
I could quit and become the bitter old
bitch who devoted her whole life

78
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:52,850
to rock and roll
and never succeeded...

79
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:58,547
or I could stick with it and become the
bitter old bitch who refused to give up.

80
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:03,560
Hmm, bitter rock chick
in a band?

81
00:06:03,596 --> 00:06:05,621
Bitter rock chick without a band?

82
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:09,328
Either way, bitter and rock and roll
end up together.

83
00:06:12,905 --> 00:06:15,874
Woman :
Go this way.

84
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:18,672
This, if--
( laughs )

85
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:21,908
Hello, lesbian lovers.

86
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:25,111
Hello,
lady who kept make up from mind.

87
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:26,880
Now here's a foolish question.

88
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:29,114
- Is Tracy here yet?
- ( chuckles )

89
00:06:31,524 --> 00:06:33,890
Hello. Testes, one,
two, three. Testes.

90
00:06:33,926 --> 00:06:38,625
# Ooga-chaka, ooga-ooga,
ooga-chaka, ooga-ooga #

91
00:06:38,664 --> 00:06:41,064
# Ooga-chaka, ooga-ooga #

92
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:45,628
# I can't stop this feeling #

93
00:06:45,705 --> 00:06:48,401
# Deep inside of me #

94
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:52,775
# Girl, you just don't realize #

95
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:54,973
- # What you do to me #
- Fuck!

96
00:06:55,014 --> 00:06:59,383
# When I hold you
in my arms so tight #

97
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:00,886
Shut up!

98
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:04,682
# Hooked on a feeling #

99
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:06,954
I cannot believe you know
the words of that fucking song!

100
00:07:06,993 --> 00:07:09,757
Tracy, while we were waiting for you,
we took a vote.

101
00:07:09,796 --> 00:07:11,388
We're now a cover band.

102
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,194
Cover this, dude.

103
00:07:13,232 --> 00:07:14,927
Whore.

104
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:16,696
I'm like Cher.

105
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:19,738
Hey!
# That you're in love with me #

106
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:23,708
Yeah, yeah.
No way, man. I read the pamphlets.

107
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:25,973
Today's marijuana,
tomorrow I'm a crack whore.

108
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:27,946
Faith:
I know this girl.

109
00:07:28,981 --> 00:07:30,744
She had a labia reduction.

110
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:32,182
Man.

111
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:38,754
Ladies and gentlemen, are you ready
for that cheap rock and roll sound?

112
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:41,521
The band you've been trying
to avoid all your life,

113
00:07:41,561 --> 00:07:44,860
the fucking worst band
in the history of rock and roll.

114
00:07:44,897 --> 00:07:47,525
- Would you mind not fucking--
- I'm embarrassed to introduce--

115
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:50,832
All right, Nick, Nick, enough.
Here, smoke pot and shut up, dude.

116
00:07:50,903 --> 00:07:52,871
Think this could wait
until after rehearsal?

117
00:07:52,905 --> 00:07:56,136
- I don't think so.
- I don't think so. We'll be right back.

118
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:03,578
- Nick: Yeah!
- Come on, man, leave 'em alone.

119
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:07,143
It's the rock and roll sound.

120
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,715
- How much?
- 200, baby.

121
00:08:11,757 --> 00:08:14,783
Oh, that's what I'm talking about.
I must've been a good boy.

122
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:17,159
You look so good.

123
00:08:21,133 --> 00:08:24,034
God, you're so beautiful!

124
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:26,368
Why don't you
come with me, huh?

125
00:08:26,405 --> 00:08:29,636
You don't need to practice.
They can practice. Quit.

126
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:31,472
- C'mon, Nick.
- Come with me in Mexico.

127
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,570
I can't, they'll kill me.
I got to stay.

128
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:38,106
Go. Get out.

129
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:41,711
At least come into the bathroom with me.
I want to show you something.

130
00:08:41,754 --> 00:08:44,382
Don't be
a fucking pig, dude, c'mon.

131
00:08:44,423 --> 00:08:46,015
Go.

132
00:08:46,058 --> 00:08:48,526
- Yo!
- Shut your hole!

133
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:53,726
# She says bad luck
follows me around #

134
00:08:53,766 --> 00:08:56,701
# All my friends
have let me down #

135
00:08:56,769 --> 00:09:00,170
# I don't need this dress,
these drugs, this town #

136
00:09:00,239 --> 00:09:04,676
# These people, this party,
yeah, it's bringin' me down #

137
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:10,343
Buen dia, compadre.

138
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:12,351
- How are you doing?
- Good, good, good.

139
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:15,011
Real good.

140
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:21,349
# She says
I never used to live like this #

141
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:24,363
# I had it all
and walked away from it #

142
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:28,163
# I don't need these problems,
this drama, this shit #

143
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:31,362
# It's 3:00 a.m.
and I'm losing my grip #

144
00:09:31,437 --> 00:09:34,770
# With mouth full of lies
and heart full of sighs #

145
00:09:34,807 --> 00:09:38,675
# "Why me, oh Lord,
why me?" she cries #

146
00:09:38,711 --> 00:09:43,307
# 'Cause everyone else
is so fucked up #

147
00:09:45,484 --> 00:09:50,421
# And everything else
is so fucked up #

148
00:09:50,456 --> 00:09:52,253
All the time.

149
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:57,558
# And it always finds me,
it's just my luck #

150
00:10:07,473 --> 00:10:10,067
# Ms Tweak lives
in Hollywood #

151
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:13,044
# Looking up at hell
she thinks she's got it so good #

152
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:16,947
# She don't need
no friends, no family, no man #

153
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:20,282
# She don't need nothing, man,
she don't give a damn #

154
00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:23,584
# With a mouth full of lies
and a heart full of sighs #

155
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:27,389
# "Why me, oh Lord,
why me?" she cries #

156
00:10:27,426 --> 00:10:32,193
# "'Cause everyone else
is so fucked up" #

157
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:39,494
# "And everything else
is so fucked up" #

158
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:46,201
# And it always finds me,
it's just my luck #

159
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:52,175
# She says,
"Blah, blah, blah" #

160
00:10:52,218 --> 00:10:55,654
# She says
nothing at all #

161
00:10:55,688 --> 00:10:59,351
# She says
"Blah, blah, blah" #

162
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:02,486
# She says
nothing at all. #

163
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:22,905
Look at you.

164
00:11:22,948 --> 00:11:25,246
I can't believe you didn't tell me
you were getting out?

165
00:11:25,284 --> 00:11:26,774
I wanted to surprise you.

166
00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:28,081
You know that guy?

167
00:11:31,257 --> 00:11:33,020
Grab my bass, will you?

168
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:37,556
Oh, man!

169
00:11:37,596 --> 00:11:38,961
Who's this guy?

170
00:11:38,998 --> 00:11:40,989
I don't know, he's kind of
fucking hot though.

171
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:43,331
In an "America's Most Wanted"
kind of way.

172
00:11:43,402 --> 00:11:47,304
- Hi! I'm Faith.
- I'm Animal.

173
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:48,431
Animal?

174
00:11:48,507 --> 00:11:52,034
- I'm Sally's brother.
- You have a brother?

175
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:53,204
Named Animal?

176
00:11:53,245 --> 00:11:55,873
Wow!
Well, where you been?

177
00:11:55,915 --> 00:11:57,678
- I was in--
- He was in college.

178
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:00,880
Yeah-- no, he's got lvy League
written all over him.

179
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,514
Hey guys, can we just have
a minute, please?

180
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,456
- All right.
- Thanks.

181
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:07,550
- I was in prison.
- Did he just say prison?

182
00:12:07,593 --> 00:12:10,323
Yes, he did.
How long and what for?

183
00:12:10,362 --> 00:12:12,796
Dude, you're not supposed
to ask that!

184
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:15,130
Is there a prison etiquette
I don't know about?

185
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:17,692
I want to make sure he's not a child
molester, or a rapist.

186
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:20,261
Jacki, he's--
he's my brother.

187
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:21,931
They're always
someone's brother.

188
00:12:22,007 --> 00:12:24,669
You look friendlier
in the photos.

189
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:26,974
It's nice
to finally meet you, Jacki.

190
00:12:28,013 --> 00:12:29,674
What photos?

191
00:12:29,715 --> 00:12:32,650
Great to finally meet you, Jacki.

192
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:36,712
Nick, say hello
to Sally's brother, Animal.

193
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,621
- Hey, man.
- Nick: Animal?

194
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:43,823
You got a problem, man?

195
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:46,024
I don't know. Do I?

196
00:12:46,065 --> 00:12:47,327
I don't know.
Do you?

197
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:50,699
Stop it, Nick. Splashing
your testosterone all over the place.

198
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:51,998
Shut up, Jack!

199
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:54,005
Don't talk to her
like that, man.

200
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:57,031
( whistles, laughing )

201
00:12:57,109 --> 00:13:00,044
Maybe I should
just come back later, huh?

202
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:04,111
I saw a motel a few blocks back.
It rents by the week.

203
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:07,278
Dude, we got an extra room,
you should totally stay with us.

204
00:13:07,319 --> 00:13:10,015
Is that okay?

205
00:13:11,056 --> 00:13:13,718
Sure, yeah.

206
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:15,756
Jacki:
Yeah, it'd be totally cool.

207
00:13:15,861 --> 00:13:18,853
'Cause if Tracy and Sally
just play it totally straight,

208
00:13:18,931 --> 00:13:23,300
and I come in just kind of chugging,
like really slow, slow, slow, slow.

209
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:25,599
Then you'd come in
with this lead, really slow,

210
00:13:25,671 --> 00:13:27,662
toom-toom-toom,
build, build, build,

211
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,503
then we just slam
into the chorus.

212
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:31,737
- lt'll be hot, man.
- ( vibrator buzzing )

213
00:13:31,777 --> 00:13:33,904
So shall I start without you?

214
00:13:33,946 --> 00:13:35,937
I got to go.

215
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:40,384
- Uh-huh.
- Uh-huh. Come here.

216
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:42,319
- Turn that thing off.
- Uh-huh.

217
00:13:47,059 --> 00:13:49,857
( grunts )
Love is evil.

218
00:13:49,895 --> 00:13:51,419
And cruel.

219
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:04,541
Radio: I'll tell you
anotherthing. Ifyourteenager

220
00:14:04,577 --> 00:14:07,740
is listening to
the heavy metal music, be warned:

221
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:11,375
This could be the first step
towards renouncing Jesus.

222
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:13,408
- Oh my God!
- What the fuck is that?

223
00:14:13,452 --> 00:14:15,716
This music is sponsored
by Satan himself...

224
00:14:15,754 --> 00:14:17,881
- Ooh, Satan!
- ( laughs )

225
00:14:17,923 --> 00:14:21,017
...goes hand in hand
with premarital sex,

226
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,961
alcoholism,
addiction to marijuana,

227
00:14:23,996 --> 00:14:26,988
and in some cases,
madness.

228
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:30,433
- Wild madness!
- Oh, God!

229
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:35,106
( heavy metal music playing )

230
00:14:40,946 --> 00:14:44,347
# So messed up,
I want you here #

231
00:14:48,621 --> 00:14:52,648
# In my room,
I want you here #

232
00:14:56,862 --> 00:15:00,889
# Now we're gonna be
face to face #

233
00:15:04,103 --> 00:15:08,130
# And I'll lay right down
in my favorite place #

234
00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:16,042
# But now I wanna
be your dog #

235
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:20,313
# 'Cause now I wanna be
your dog #

236
00:15:20,352 --> 00:15:24,584
# 'Cause now I wanna
be your dog #

237
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:34,824
# Well, come on! #

238
00:15:37,503 --> 00:15:40,802
( phone ringing )

239
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:49,080
- ( machine beeps )
- Man: Fuck, I didn't hear the beep.

240
00:15:50,082 --> 00:15:53,347
Jacki, It's Chuck
from Triple Z records.

241
00:15:53,385 --> 00:15:55,683
Listen, uh, I'm sorry--

242
00:15:55,721 --> 00:15:57,746
Hey Chuck, what's up?

243
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:01,390
I'm not busy, man.

244
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:07,956
Yeah, I know about it, it's next month.
I read it in the Weekly. Why?

245
00:16:08,033 --> 00:16:11,560
# 'Cause now I'm ready
to feel your hand #

246
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,366
That's too bad, man.

247
00:16:18,744 --> 00:16:21,872
Yeah, I mean, well, you know, I got
to ask the rest of the band, but...

248
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:23,677
that sounds pretty cool.

249
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:26,844
Uh-huh.

250
00:16:26,885 --> 00:16:30,377
Yeah, I'll get back to you, man.
Cool, thanks. Bye.

251
00:16:30,422 --> 00:16:32,856
What is your problem?

252
00:16:32,891 --> 00:16:34,552
Jesus, that was Chuck!

253
00:16:34,593 --> 00:16:37,153
- I don't care who that was.
- He wanted to tell me--

254
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:38,356
Like I give a shit?

255
00:16:40,566 --> 00:16:41,965
I got to pee.

256
00:16:46,972 --> 00:16:49,907
- ( door closes )
- Fuck!

257
00:16:51,877 --> 00:16:54,778
Jacki's voice: Every band dreams
ofgetting a call like this.

258
00:17:05,924 --> 00:17:07,755
Yes! Yes!

259
00:17:07,793 --> 00:17:10,785
- You're such a dick!
- Just a second!

260
00:17:14,633 --> 00:17:18,262
Jacki's voice: Oh God. Please don't
let us fuck this up.

261
00:17:26,478 --> 00:17:27,877
What are you doing?

262
00:17:27,913 --> 00:17:31,405
You know what, fuck you, Jacki
and your band! I don't need this shit!

263
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:35,716
Jessica, come on, man,
don't be stupid, you're not leaving.

264
00:17:35,754 --> 00:17:39,588
You're so smart?
You don't even know when to apologize!

265
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:41,820
- Apologize for what?
- For what?!

266
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:44,761
I'm sorry for picking up the phone
when I was fucking you again!

267
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:46,594
- Jessica--
- How about, I'm sorry!

268
00:17:46,632 --> 00:17:49,658
I'm sorry for not being at your birthday
'cause of my damn rehearsal!

269
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:52,499
- You knew about that.
- You never hang out at my house.

270
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:55,404
You don't take me dancing
to the gay bars 'cause--

271
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:57,636
- 'cause you hate the music?
- Well, it sucks.

272
00:17:57,676 --> 00:18:00,509
- Fuck the music.
- Okay, I'm sorry, baby, I'm sorry!

273
00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:02,343
Oh, I'm sick of this shit!

274
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:03,905
I just apologized.

275
00:18:07,986 --> 00:18:10,921
Come on, you know
you don't want to leave!

276
00:18:10,956 --> 00:18:12,480
It's mine!

277
00:18:15,394 --> 00:18:17,589
Jessica!

278
00:18:19,565 --> 00:18:20,554
( door closes )

279
00:18:23,836 --> 00:18:25,667
Fuck.

280
00:18:25,838 --> 00:18:29,399
Ooh! Chuck called!
What the fuck did he want?

281
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:32,876
He came sniffing around here,
and then what? Nothing.

282
00:18:32,911 --> 00:18:36,574
- Just listen--
- I don't know. No, Jacki.

283
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:41,018
- Fuck him, and his faux British accent!
- Faux?

284
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:44,022
Listen, I know the guy
is super cheesy but he gets shit done.

285
00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:46,490
Dude, he doesn't even
fucking return your calls, man.

286
00:18:46,525 --> 00:18:47,822
Maybe he's busy.

287
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,691
That's funny, because when
I don't return

288
00:18:49,728 --> 00:18:52,492
people's telephone calls,
that means I don't wanna talk to 'em.

289
00:18:52,531 --> 00:18:56,023
- Guys, come on, let her finish.
- Jacki: Thank you, Sally.

290
00:18:56,101 --> 00:18:58,831
Okay, you're ready,
this is great. Now-- well,

291
00:18:58,904 --> 00:19:02,032
you know the drummer guy,
from Thrill 13, right?

292
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:03,905
Well, he O.D.'d.

293
00:19:03,942 --> 00:19:08,174
Wow! Now, that is great
fucking news, dude.

294
00:19:08,213 --> 00:19:10,044
- (laughter)
- That's not what I meant.

295
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:12,312
Oh, wait, they're opening
for X, right?

296
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:14,717
They were.

297
00:19:14,753 --> 00:19:18,120
And one of the reason's Chuck called,
he can't promise us anything,

298
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,387
but he's going to try
to get us that opening slot.

299
00:19:20,425 --> 00:19:22,359
What? That's fucking great!

300
00:19:22,394 --> 00:19:24,328
Oh, and that's not all.

301
00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:27,389
He wants to take a meeting
with us on Thursday.

302
00:19:27,432 --> 00:19:30,060
Oh my God! He's going
to sign us, I know it.

303
00:19:30,135 --> 00:19:33,104
You are
the sweetest little angel.

304
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:35,697
What, isn't that part
of the reason that we're in a band?

305
00:19:35,774 --> 00:19:39,835
- To get signed, and go on tour?
- Actually, I'm in a band so I get laid.

306
00:19:39,878 --> 00:19:43,041
Come on, dude, chicks do not need
to be in a band to get laid.

307
00:19:43,081 --> 00:19:44,446
- Faith: Shut the fuck up.
- Nice.

308
00:19:46,051 --> 00:19:47,848
( guitar riffs )

309
00:19:47,886 --> 00:19:48,910
( thumps )

310
00:19:48,954 --> 00:19:51,047
Okay, ready?

311
00:19:51,089 --> 00:19:53,990
( electric guitarplaying )

312
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:15,943
- What do you think?
- Oh, um--

313
00:20:15,981 --> 00:20:18,040
it-- that wasn't bad.

314
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:20,244
Yeah!

315
00:20:20,285 --> 00:20:23,743
Okay, but do you remember,
we were talking about...

316
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:25,848
the dynamics of a song.

317
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:27,950
What's that?

318
00:20:27,993 --> 00:20:29,722
Um...

319
00:20:29,761 --> 00:20:32,093
oh, look at--
we're out of time!

320
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:37,090
- Okay, I'll see you next week, then.
- Yes, cool.

321
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:38,295
Okay, bye.

322
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:44,142
Mom, that was really good,
thank you. It was so good.

323
00:20:44,209 --> 00:20:47,144
Well, after coffee,
you get to open your presents.

324
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:50,478
- Oh yes, presents!
- I spent a lot of money.

325
00:20:50,515 --> 00:20:52,380
But I got a big question,
serious question,

326
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:55,352
I don't see a pony anywhere,
am I ever going to get a pony?

327
00:20:55,387 --> 00:20:59,915
Every year, I'm promised a pony,
and every year there's no pony!

328
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:02,085
Oh, I'll never forget
the look on your face

329
00:21:02,127 --> 00:21:04,891
when we got you that bike
that looked like a pony.

330
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:08,024
- I didn't know that.
- And she named it Lucky.

331
00:21:08,066 --> 00:21:10,591
Did you know she used to put
carrots in the garage

332
00:21:10,669 --> 00:21:12,864
hoping that the bike's
going to eat the carrots?

333
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:17,375
I loved that bike. One time, I remember
I came out to play, and it was gone?

334
00:21:17,409 --> 00:21:19,274
- Remember that?
- Somebody stole Lucky?

335
00:21:19,311 --> 00:21:21,302
- I don't remember that.
- No, Dad took it.

336
00:21:21,346 --> 00:21:24,907
Dad hid Lucky to teach me a lesson
to not leave it out on the front lawn.

337
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:27,384
- What else is new?
- How can you not remember that?

338
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:30,183
I came in, I was freaking out,
screaming and crying,

339
00:21:30,222 --> 00:21:31,883
"Oh my God! Oh my God!
Where's Lucky?"

340
00:21:31,923 --> 00:21:34,414
He said, "Ifit was up your ass
so you'd know where he was. "

341
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:37,917
How about when he used to say,
"Go get me something to hit you with."

342
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:39,692
- What was that?
- How lame were we?

343
00:21:39,731 --> 00:21:41,494
Why did we always
get him a belt?

344
00:21:41,533 --> 00:21:44,525
How genius would it have been,
if we came with a wet noodle and said,

345
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:46,036
"Go ahead, Dad, whale on us."

346
00:21:46,071 --> 00:21:48,039
I wish I had a dollar
for every time he said,

347
00:21:48,106 --> 00:21:50,074
"Did your mother have
any kids that lived?"

348
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:52,633
- Shut up, you, guys.
- How about when he'd give us a bath?

349
00:21:52,711 --> 00:21:54,611
- Our special bath--
- That is enough!

350
00:22:00,052 --> 00:22:03,317
Way to go, Jacki.
I told you, that shit is just not funny.

351
00:22:03,355 --> 00:22:05,721
- You think I don't know that?
- Yeah.

352
00:22:06,925 --> 00:22:08,893
( exhales )

353
00:22:08,927 --> 00:22:10,656
Enough.

354
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:16,191
( groans )

355
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:35,448
Sorry, Mom.

356
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:39,388
I just don't know
how you and your sister

357
00:22:39,424 --> 00:22:41,790
can joke and go on like that.

358
00:22:44,062 --> 00:22:46,428
Well, what are our choices?

359
00:22:56,475 --> 00:22:59,638
( exhales )

360
00:22:59,678 --> 00:23:03,079
So, how are things going
with the band?

361
00:23:05,317 --> 00:23:06,784
What?

362
00:23:06,818 --> 00:23:08,718
Nothing.

363
00:23:08,754 --> 00:23:11,416
They're fine.

364
00:23:11,456 --> 00:23:12,923
They're good. I mean--

365
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,754
we'll see.
We have a small label looking at us.

366
00:23:16,795 --> 00:23:19,127
Well, that's terrific, isn't it?

367
00:23:19,164 --> 00:23:20,426
Yeah, we'll see.

368
00:23:20,465 --> 00:23:23,923
Will they show
all those tattoos on MTV?

369
00:23:23,969 --> 00:23:28,201
Mom, I'm gonna keep
my sleeves over it, all the time.

370
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,105
Just for you.
See that?

371
00:23:30,142 --> 00:23:32,007
There.

372
00:23:32,043 --> 00:23:35,206
I bet if you got a job
illustrating books

373
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:37,374
instead of people
they'd provide you with...

374
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:39,316
Both:
medical and dental insurance.

375
00:23:39,351 --> 00:23:43,913
Well, honey, it's true! What if, God
forbid, something happens to you!

376
00:23:43,955 --> 00:23:46,822
- Nothing's gonna happen to me.
- And you smoke way too much.

377
00:23:46,858 --> 00:23:50,225
Mom, I smoke just enough.

378
00:23:52,531 --> 00:23:57,468
Come on, I know you got
a cake in there somewhere for me.

379
00:23:57,502 --> 00:24:00,369
Yep.
I baked your favorite chocolate.

380
00:24:00,405 --> 00:24:03,772
- With marshmallow frosting.
- Yes!

381
00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:06,778
Come on, Mom.
Bring it on!

382
00:24:06,812 --> 00:24:09,246
Jacki's voice: She left him
when I was 10, thank God.

383
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:12,978
Still, a day doesn't go by
when I don't think about him.

384
00:24:13,018 --> 00:24:18,285
After all, he helped make me
the woman I am today. Way to go, Dad!

385
00:24:18,323 --> 00:24:20,018
( electrical buzzing )

386
00:24:20,058 --> 00:24:22,492
- Dude, she is going to be so psyched.
- ( groans )

387
00:24:23,995 --> 00:24:26,225
- She better like it.
- You kidding me?

388
00:24:26,264 --> 00:24:28,232
She's gonna fucking love it.

389
00:24:28,266 --> 00:24:31,360
Nothing says "life-time commitment"
quite like a tattoo.

390
00:24:33,238 --> 00:24:35,968
How's that girl you've been seeing?
What's her name?

391
00:24:36,007 --> 00:24:38,976
Jessica.
How is Jessica doing?

392
00:24:39,044 --> 00:24:41,239
- She dumped me.
- (laughs )

393
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:43,042
What's wrong with you?

394
00:24:43,081 --> 00:24:45,743
You can't keep no man,
you can't keep no woman--

395
00:24:47,085 --> 00:24:48,916
Sally spells her name
with one "L", right?

396
00:24:50,355 --> 00:24:52,220
Oh, you suck!

397
00:24:56,528 --> 00:24:59,019
Jacki:
That's a bitchen shirt, by the way.

398
00:24:59,064 --> 00:25:00,429
Oh, thank you.

399
00:25:00,465 --> 00:25:03,798
It's too bad we missed that whole
riot girl scene by about a butt hair.

400
00:25:03,869 --> 00:25:06,497
- Or 10 years.
- Same thing.

401
00:25:06,571 --> 00:25:09,734
But you know, you did pioneer
that whole "Riot Mom" thing--

402
00:25:09,774 --> 00:25:11,264
that was good.

403
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:13,004
Oh, happy birthday too,
by the way.

404
00:25:13,044 --> 00:25:15,069
Ow! Shit!

405
00:25:15,113 --> 00:25:17,104
- What?
- Fuck, that hurts!

406
00:25:17,148 --> 00:25:19,343
It's a tattoo, man.
It's got to hurt a little feel to good.

407
00:25:19,384 --> 00:25:24,185
- Come on, now. Don't be a pussy.
- Jeez! You don't do that again.

408
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:30,125
Do you ever think about quitting?

409
00:25:30,161 --> 00:25:32,026
Quitting what?

410
00:25:32,063 --> 00:25:34,122
Music.

411
00:25:34,165 --> 00:25:38,101
Well, let's pretend I could do
something else, which I cannot.

412
00:25:38,136 --> 00:25:41,401
Um... no.

413
00:25:43,942 --> 00:25:46,775
- ( exhales )
- Oh, wait, who's this, who's this?

414
00:25:46,811 --> 00:25:50,941
"We're gonna play
as long as there is an audience, man.

415
00:25:50,982 --> 00:25:56,113
And when there's no audience,
we're gonna play for the bartender!"

416
00:25:56,154 --> 00:25:59,123
I never did that lame-ass gesture.
You're such a dick.

417
00:25:59,157 --> 00:26:01,125
You might as well tattoo that
on your forehead.

418
00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:05,027
No, seriously, don't you ever think
about being 50 or 60 years old,

419
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:08,123
hauling our gear around,
passing out fliers,

420
00:26:08,166 --> 00:26:11,602
fighting with the bookers
and still sweating the rent?

421
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:16,903
Fuck the rent.

422
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:19,377
(knocking on door )

423
00:26:21,212 --> 00:26:22,304
Ahem.

424
00:26:24,983 --> 00:26:27,281
- Hello, my angel.
- Hey.

425
00:26:28,987 --> 00:26:31,217
- ( door closes )
- What's up, girl?

426
00:26:33,024 --> 00:26:36,425
- Where's Sally?
- Her room.

427
00:26:36,461 --> 00:26:39,055
- Is Jacki here?
- Uh-uh.

428
00:26:40,498 --> 00:26:42,762
You know, it's these
meaningful talks we have...

429
00:26:42,801 --> 00:26:45,531
that just make me feel
so connected to you.

430
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:07,221
Close your eyes.

431
00:27:08,226 --> 00:27:10,626
Close your eyes.

432
00:27:16,434 --> 00:27:18,368
Open 'em.

433
00:27:21,573 --> 00:27:24,633
- Oh, is it real?
- Yes, it's real!

434
00:27:24,709 --> 00:27:27,701
Ouch!
Jacki just did it today.

435
00:27:27,746 --> 00:27:29,577
Oh, my God, Faith.

436
00:27:33,618 --> 00:27:35,984
Happy anniversary.

437
00:27:36,021 --> 00:27:39,957
Oh, baby, it's so, so beautiful.

438
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:42,585
I love you so much.

439
00:27:42,627 --> 00:27:44,561
I love you too.

440
00:27:59,944 --> 00:28:01,673
- Let me see it.
- Oh.

441
00:28:04,215 --> 00:28:06,843
You know,
I was noticing something--

442
00:28:06,885 --> 00:28:09,786
something different
about you today.

443
00:28:09,821 --> 00:28:11,652
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

444
00:28:12,791 --> 00:28:14,884
You have this brother.

445
00:28:18,396 --> 00:28:20,057
Hey!

446
00:28:23,001 --> 00:28:27,768
I wanted to tell you about a thousand
times, and then he just showed up.

447
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,035
So, what did he do?

448
00:28:31,076 --> 00:28:32,668
Faith, no.

449
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:34,679
( exhales )

450
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:41,682
Well,
do you even want him here?

451
00:28:43,154 --> 00:28:44,985
Yeah, I do.

452
00:28:48,193 --> 00:28:50,718
Please don't make me
talk about this right now.

453
00:28:50,762 --> 00:28:52,787
You don't have to talk
about that.

454
00:28:57,202 --> 00:28:59,864
( knocking on door )

455
00:28:59,938 --> 00:29:01,906
(indistinct talking on TV)

456
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:06,510
You want me to get that?

457
00:29:16,821 --> 00:29:18,618
Hey.

458
00:29:19,891 --> 00:29:21,256
Hey.

459
00:29:21,292 --> 00:29:24,955
- How are you doing?
- Mm-hmm. I'm good.

460
00:29:34,072 --> 00:29:36,939
- I guess I'm gonna finish to get ready.
- Mm-hmm.

461
00:29:40,411 --> 00:29:44,006
He's coming with us?
I thought it was girl's night out.

462
00:29:44,048 --> 00:29:45,845
Apparently not, dude.

463
00:29:45,884 --> 00:29:47,442
After the gig,
let's go do something.

464
00:29:47,485 --> 00:29:50,318
Can't man.
Nick's coming over.

465
00:29:50,355 --> 00:29:52,050
Oh, you suck!

466
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:54,820
When was the last time we hung out?
I miss you, man.

467
00:29:56,361 --> 00:29:59,159
- Ever since you and Nick got together--
- Jacki.

468
00:29:59,197 --> 00:30:02,860
At least I'm in a relationship.
God forbid you have an emotion or two.

469
00:30:02,901 --> 00:30:05,165
That's really sweet.

470
00:30:05,236 --> 00:30:07,932
We're talking
about you right now, not me.

471
00:30:08,006 --> 00:30:10,531
No, Jacki.
It's always about you.

472
00:30:10,608 --> 00:30:13,008
Right now we're talking about
your opinion of me.

473
00:30:13,044 --> 00:30:16,605
No, right now
it's about my concern for you.

474
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:19,344
You mean for the band?

475
00:30:19,384 --> 00:30:22,353
You got a problem, dude.
You got to deal with it.

476
00:30:22,387 --> 00:30:24,548
My only problem is you
at my ass lately.

477
00:30:24,589 --> 00:30:29,549
- Is that right?
- Yeah. Other than that, I'm just fine.

478
00:30:29,594 --> 00:30:32,290
Tracy, we have a really
good chance of getting signed.

479
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:33,922
I don't want you
to fuck this up for me.

480
00:30:33,965 --> 00:30:36,365
- You?
- Us, you know what I mean.

481
00:30:36,434 --> 00:30:38,402
Yeah, I know what you mean.

482
00:30:38,469 --> 00:30:41,199
Are you in this band
because you like to play,

483
00:30:41,272 --> 00:30:43,672
or are you still just trying
to piss of your parents?

484
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,375
Yeah.

485
00:30:47,412 --> 00:30:50,813
At least I'm not a 40-year-old wishing
I was a 25-year-old rock star.

486
00:30:54,786 --> 00:30:57,755
- Fuck.
- Come on, you guys, let's go!

487
00:30:57,789 --> 00:31:02,226
Hey, Jacki!
Happy birthday, dude!

488
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:05,024
Is it your birthday?
Hey, happy birthday! How old are you?

489
00:31:05,063 --> 00:31:06,997
How big is your dick?

490
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:08,623
I'll wait outside.

491
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:14,604
( door opens, closes )

492
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:18,104
So, what are we going to do
about Ms. Tweak?

493
00:31:18,142 --> 00:31:21,703
I never thought I'd long for the days
when Tracy was just drinking too much.

494
00:31:21,746 --> 00:31:24,840
You're not thinking
of kicking her out, are you?

495
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:28,080
I'm thinking I'd like to kick her ass
up and down the street.

496
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:32,078
- She's a fucking great bass player.
- She's a great friend!

497
00:31:32,123 --> 00:31:35,456
Can you imagine going into the studio
with that? She'd be a nightmare.

498
00:31:36,461 --> 00:31:39,919
- Talk to her.
- I tried. She doesn't want to hear it.

499
00:31:44,168 --> 00:31:46,159
Do you want to see
a hot show?

500
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:57,040
Nick, how many times do I have
to tell you I do not like bell peppers?

501
00:31:57,081 --> 00:32:00,539
Man, I told the guy twice--
no bell peppers.

502
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:02,917
The guy's an asshole.

503
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:10,189
Fuck, man!

504
00:32:10,228 --> 00:32:13,686
( sniffing )
Mmm!

505
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:16,266
The good stuff.

506
00:32:16,334 --> 00:32:18,427
What is wrong with you?

507
00:32:20,538 --> 00:32:24,406
- I had a fight with Jacki.
- Again? Fuck her.

508
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:32,548
You think I drink too much?

509
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:35,745
Is that what she said?

510
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:38,585
You know,
she could use a fucking drink.

511
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:41,717
Don't worry
about any of that tonight.

512
00:32:42,894 --> 00:32:45,795
I want you to just relax.

513
00:32:46,931 --> 00:32:50,890
Have you been thinking
about the fantasy, hmm?

514
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:54,496
- We're not doing that tonight, are we?
- No, no, not tonight, but--

515
00:32:54,572 --> 00:32:57,598
maybe you've been
thinking about it, hmm?

516
00:32:57,675 --> 00:33:00,007
Come on. Get off.

517
00:33:01,379 --> 00:33:04,473
You promised you wouldn't talk
about it once I agreed.

518
00:33:07,552 --> 00:33:09,679
All right,
what movie did you rent?

519
00:33:09,721 --> 00:33:12,189
I thought we'd watch one
of the ones I got last week.

520
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:18,091
Right. Porn and pizza.
That's real romantic.

521
00:33:21,132 --> 00:33:23,999
How long is that guy
staying here, anyways?

522
00:33:24,068 --> 00:33:27,265
- Nick, don't start, man.
- No, I'm just asking-- how long?

523
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:30,034
And don't pick a fight
with him either, all right?

524
00:33:30,074 --> 00:33:32,269
Oh, yeah? And why is that?
Because he's been in prison,

525
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:34,403
and has lots of tattoos?
I'm so scared.

526
00:33:34,445 --> 00:33:37,505
No. Because it's stupid,
and pointless, that's why.

527
00:33:38,916 --> 00:33:42,079
God, why do guys
always have to fight?

528
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:45,954
Because we're men.
Manly men.

529
00:33:47,792 --> 00:33:50,420
And that's what men do.

530
00:33:50,461 --> 00:33:54,295
They already fucking hate you.
Can you please not make it any worse?

531
00:33:54,332 --> 00:33:56,527
What are you talking about?
They love me.

532
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:00,870
# I was into smashing bottles #

533
00:34:00,905 --> 00:34:02,065
# Oh, yeah #

534
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:05,109
# While you were laughing,
calling me crazy #

535
00:34:05,143 --> 00:34:06,371
# Oh, yeah #

536
00:34:06,411 --> 00:34:09,471
- # Oh yeah, yeah, yeah #
- # Oh yeah #

537
00:34:09,514 --> 00:34:11,607
So are they... together?

538
00:34:11,649 --> 00:34:14,049
Do you got
a problem with that?

539
00:34:14,085 --> 00:34:18,249
No. She's never
mentioned it though.

540
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:27,759
Still bugged about Tracy?

541
00:34:27,799 --> 00:34:29,289
Jacki: Whatever.

542
00:34:30,368 --> 00:34:31,630
What do you know, anyway?

543
00:34:33,004 --> 00:34:35,336
I know
Sally really looks up to you.

544
00:34:37,041 --> 00:34:39,373
I know you've worked
your ass off for this band

545
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:41,002
and good things
are finally happening.

546
00:34:42,447 --> 00:34:44,847
- And I also know--
- Jesus Christ!

547
00:34:44,882 --> 00:34:47,146
Didn't you have anything
better to do in prison

548
00:34:47,185 --> 00:34:50,086
than listen to Sally's
up-to-the-minute Clamdandy reports?

549
00:34:50,121 --> 00:34:52,419
No.

550
00:34:58,563 --> 00:35:02,158
Look, I know she didn't tell you about
me, but I feel like I know you guys.

551
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,395
Dude, you didn't know
your sister was a dyke!

552
00:35:04,469 --> 00:35:06,198
No. I know you are sometimes.

553
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:10,001
So, Animal,
what did you do for fun in prison?

554
00:35:11,209 --> 00:35:13,109
She said you could be a bitch.

555
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:18,438
- But mostly she said nice things.
-Yeah, and you believed her?

556
00:35:18,483 --> 00:35:23,045
Of course. Otherwise I wouldn't find
myself liking you as much as I do.

557
00:35:23,087 --> 00:35:24,384
Really?

558
00:35:24,422 --> 00:35:27,186
- # It was a good Iife honey #
- And I think you Iike me, too.

559
00:35:27,225 --> 00:35:29,523
- What?
- # We never had to beat... #

560
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:32,393
- #...around the bush #
- I said I think you like me.

561
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:35,763
# Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah #

562
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:39,793
# Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah,
oh yeah! #

563
00:35:46,444 --> 00:35:53,213
( soft music playing )

564
00:35:55,019 --> 00:35:59,080
# If I fall short #

565
00:35:59,123 --> 00:36:03,492
# If I don't make the grade #

566
00:36:03,528 --> 00:36:08,329
# Ifyour expectations
aren't met in me today #

567
00:36:08,366 --> 00:36:10,266
( Iaughs )

568
00:36:11,369 --> 00:36:16,397
- # There's always tomorrow #
- Yeah!

569
00:36:16,474 --> 00:36:20,501
- # Or tomorrow night #
- Come on, Nick, let me see that ass.

570
00:36:20,545 --> 00:36:23,912
# Hang in there, baby #

571
00:36:23,948 --> 00:36:28,442
# Sooner or later
I know I'll get it right #

572
00:36:30,721 --> 00:36:35,317
# Please don't give up on me #

573
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:39,625
- # Oh, please, don't give up on me #
- Come on, you can't do it like that.

574
00:36:39,664 --> 00:36:40,995
Yeah.

575
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:44,399
# I know it's late #

576
00:36:44,468 --> 00:36:49,337
# Late in the game #

577
00:36:50,908 --> 00:36:55,845
# But my feelings,
my true feelings #

578
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:59,111
# Haven't changed #

579
00:37:00,618 --> 00:37:04,520
# Here in my heart #

580
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:11,484
# I know, I know I wasn't
wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong #

581
00:37:11,529 --> 00:37:14,293
# I'd like to make amends #

582
00:37:14,332 --> 00:37:21,261
# For the love that I never,
ever, ever, ever showed... #

583
00:37:21,339 --> 00:37:25,241
And now I am going
to make you achieve

584
00:37:25,276 --> 00:37:27,904
multiple orgasms

585
00:37:27,945 --> 00:37:30,573
without even touching you.

586
00:37:30,615 --> 00:37:36,144
I will achieve this
with hypnosis.

587
00:37:37,388 --> 00:37:41,017
Look into the sacred

588
00:37:41,058 --> 00:37:44,289
one-eyed snake's eye.

589
00:37:44,328 --> 00:37:48,458
- Nick.
- Concentrate on the snake.

590
00:37:48,499 --> 00:37:50,490
Concentrate
on the snake.

591
00:37:50,568 --> 00:37:52,092
( Tracy laughs )

592
00:37:52,169 --> 00:37:54,865
Do not laugh!
You do not want to anger him.

593
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:57,407
- Nick!
- What?

594
00:37:57,441 --> 00:38:01,639
Come here and fuck me.
Come on.

595
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:03,704
# Don't you give up on me #

596
00:38:03,748 --> 00:38:09,550
- # Please, please, please #
- Come on, kiss me.

597
00:38:13,257 --> 00:38:17,853
# Don't give up on me. #

598
00:38:33,077 --> 00:38:34,942
Tracy.

599
00:38:36,847 --> 00:38:38,314
Tracy.

600
00:38:54,632 --> 00:38:56,600
Thanks, baby.

601
00:39:09,413 --> 00:39:11,176
Maybe you should call her.

602
00:39:11,215 --> 00:39:14,241
Tracy knows we're meeting Chuck
at 7:00. She's gonna show up.

603
00:39:14,285 --> 00:39:17,220
- Sally: What if she doesn't?
- Jacki: I'll fucking kill her.

604
00:39:21,459 --> 00:39:24,428
Ah, lives to fuck up another day.

605
00:39:24,462 --> 00:39:25,861
Ha-ha.

606
00:39:27,164 --> 00:39:30,531
Dude, I am never
drinking red wine again.

607
00:39:30,601 --> 00:39:32,228
That's a start.

608
00:39:32,303 --> 00:39:34,396
Listen, missy,
I'm hung over, I'm not deaf.

609
00:39:35,973 --> 00:39:39,340
Hey, did you hear about our hot date
with Jacki and Animal last night?

610
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:41,470
- It was not a date!
- ( scoffs )

611
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:44,981
You're such a fucking dick.

612
00:39:45,015 --> 00:39:47,609
Oh yeah?
Did you fuck him, you whore?

613
00:39:47,651 --> 00:39:51,212
No, she didn't.
Right Jacki?

614
00:39:51,255 --> 00:39:54,918
Come on, man, he just got out of jail.
He'd fuck anything.

615
00:39:54,959 --> 00:39:58,759
-Yeah, what's Nick the Dick's excuse?
- Just kidding, Jacki.

616
00:39:58,796 --> 00:40:01,094
Make up does make the girl.

617
00:40:01,132 --> 00:40:04,397
Could we be serious just for a second?
I just want to ask you a question.

618
00:40:04,468 --> 00:40:07,528
Seriously, if you didn't know me,
how old would you think I was?

619
00:40:07,605 --> 00:40:10,130
I do know you,
and I'm not playing that game.

620
00:40:10,207 --> 00:40:14,007
Just humor me.
C'mon now, how old do I look?

621
00:40:14,044 --> 00:40:15,978
C'mon now, I could take it.

622
00:40:16,013 --> 00:40:19,972
Okay, you look--

623
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:24,010
I can't, I'm sorry.
I can't do this.

624
00:40:24,054 --> 00:40:26,249
- Who cares, Jacki?
- You're such an asshole.

625
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:28,724
- And how old are you?
- 23, why?

626
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:31,728
Yeah, well, when I was
"23, why?" I didn't care either.

627
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:36,028
Well, I think you look like
you could pass for 29.

628
00:40:36,066 --> 00:40:39,558
Thank you.
But I'm not 29.

629
00:40:39,637 --> 00:40:42,902
And the fact that I have to fucking lie
about my age-- it pisses me off.

630
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:46,103
It's true. Unless you're young, hip
and look good on the side of a building

631
00:40:46,143 --> 00:40:49,340
in a fucking designer jean ad,
we're not gonna get signed.

632
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:51,746
I mean, it's just-- I'm sorry.

633
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:55,912
I do not foresee a rock and roll
Jacki doll in the near future.

634
00:40:55,953 --> 00:40:59,389
And I hardly doubt
that we'll be drinking cola

635
00:40:59,423 --> 00:41:02,449
in some $30-million
lame-ass video.

636
00:41:04,428 --> 00:41:05,827
It's bullshit.

637
00:41:06,997 --> 00:41:10,433
I play the guitar.
I write my own fucking songs.

638
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:14,404
It's just bullshit, man.
I don't want to lie.

639
00:41:14,438 --> 00:41:16,770
I mean, everyone is a fucking liar.

640
00:41:19,677 --> 00:41:22,942
Well, I think that you look
really good for your age.

641
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:25,847
I'm going to go take a shit.

642
00:41:27,918 --> 00:41:30,944
Jacki, there are worse things
than getting old.

643
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:32,888
Yeah, like what?

644
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:37,055
Like not getting old.

645
00:41:37,094 --> 00:41:38,618
Faith:
That would suck.

646
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:41,096
Hey, Chuck.

647
00:41:41,131 --> 00:41:43,599
Hello, Clammies.
How're we doing today?

648
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:46,795
Dandy.
Nice shirt, Chuck.

649
00:41:46,871 --> 00:41:48,896
You're going to be
my new daddy?

650
00:41:48,973 --> 00:41:51,840
If you play your cards right,
I think we could work something out.

651
00:41:51,876 --> 00:41:53,673
We'll work that
into the contract.

652
00:41:53,711 --> 00:41:56,908
Jacki's voice: Okay, two dykes,
a wannabe rock star,

653
00:41:56,947 --> 00:42:00,007
and a tequila-guzzling speed freak
walk into a restaurant.

654
00:42:01,552 --> 00:42:06,421
I always imagined it would be a bit
more-- I don't know, glamorous.

655
00:42:06,457 --> 00:42:10,757
I mean, we'd be in this big, beautiful
office, we'd sign on the dotted line,

656
00:42:10,794 --> 00:42:15,629
and cut to: Band onstage playing
to thousands of adoring fans,

657
00:42:15,666 --> 00:42:20,729
"Whaa-aa! You guys rule!
Yeah!"

658
00:42:20,804 --> 00:42:23,466
My whole future
is hanging in the balance

659
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:26,806
at the Big Drip Cafe.

660
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:30,377
Okay, here's what I want.
I've been thinking about it for so long.

661
00:42:30,447 --> 00:42:31,778
She really has.

662
00:42:31,815 --> 00:42:35,012
I want it to be totally original. I want
a rose, but I want it to be yellow.

663
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:37,486
- That's so pretty!
- Right?

664
00:42:37,521 --> 00:42:41,548
Okay, and I want two leaves on one side,
but only one leaf on the other side.

665
00:42:41,592 --> 00:42:43,583
Because I'm a Gemini,
do you know what I mean?

666
00:42:43,627 --> 00:42:44,924
Totally.

667
00:42:44,962 --> 00:42:48,125
Because sometimes I can be so crazy,
and then sometimes, I'm just--

668
00:42:48,165 --> 00:42:50,827
- Not, right?
- Exactly.

669
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:54,428
- Something like that?
- Oh my God, that's it!

670
00:42:54,505 --> 00:42:56,905
- Oh, it so is!
- Where do you want it?

671
00:42:58,142 --> 00:43:01,407
I want it on my ankle,
but really low,

672
00:43:01,445 --> 00:43:03,436
and really really small,
so I can hide it.

673
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:07,280
And also, if I decide I don't like it
later, I can just have it removed.

674
00:43:07,318 --> 00:43:10,583
So, I have about
a half an hour. Can do it?

675
00:43:11,956 --> 00:43:13,617
Hmm.

676
00:43:13,657 --> 00:43:15,352
No.

677
00:43:15,392 --> 00:43:17,383
Well, why not?

678
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:21,057
Girls, there's not enough time
to explain this to you now.

679
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:23,089
Besides,
I got a costumer.

680
00:43:23,167 --> 00:43:25,635
I'm doing the Sistine Chapel
on his scrotum.

681
00:43:25,703 --> 00:43:28,137
You can stay and watch if you want.
You don't mind, do you?

682
00:43:28,172 --> 00:43:31,369
No. No, you guys can stay.

683
00:43:32,676 --> 00:43:35,008
Oh, you know what?
We'll come back later.

684
00:43:35,045 --> 00:43:36,910
Cool.

685
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:43,513
They're out there,
breeding.

686
00:43:43,554 --> 00:43:45,681
So, what's up?

687
00:43:45,723 --> 00:43:49,352
Nothing. I just thought
I'd come by and check out the shop.

688
00:43:49,393 --> 00:43:52,487
- It looks great.
- Thanks.

689
00:43:53,764 --> 00:43:58,030
So, let me guess.
Your mother did not name you Animal.

690
00:43:59,236 --> 00:44:00,965
No, that was Sally.

691
00:44:02,539 --> 00:44:06,134
I started playing drums when I was
about, I don't know, 12,

692
00:44:06,176 --> 00:44:09,839
and Sally was really
into The Muppet Show.

693
00:44:11,582 --> 00:44:13,982
You know, the little hairy red guy
who plays the drums,

694
00:44:14,018 --> 00:44:15,883
always screaming.
( screams )

695
00:44:16,887 --> 00:44:18,582
Animal.

696
00:44:20,024 --> 00:44:23,425
So you're telling me
you're named after a Muppet?

697
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:25,587
Unfortunately, yes.

698
00:44:27,831 --> 00:44:30,698
But you can bet I told the guys
in prison a different story.

699
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:35,832
So, why were you there?

700
00:44:40,144 --> 00:44:41,702
I killed someone.

701
00:44:43,247 --> 00:44:45,647
Well, manslaughter.

702
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:48,516
Thanks.

703
00:44:50,621 --> 00:44:53,886
Wow. Who?

704
00:44:53,924 --> 00:44:58,884
Our stepdad, whose name was Dick,
if you can believe that.

705
00:45:00,798 --> 00:45:04,598
He was always telling my mom
she was as useless as tits on a board.

706
00:45:07,738 --> 00:45:09,706
My mom was passed out
on the couch.

707
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:11,674
She slept
through the whole thing.

708
00:45:12,776 --> 00:45:14,767
I got off from work
early that night.

709
00:45:14,812 --> 00:45:18,373
And to get to my room
you have to pass Sally's room.

710
00:45:18,415 --> 00:45:21,680
And on my way by,
I thought I heard voices.

711
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:23,812
That sounds like Sally's crying.

712
00:45:23,854 --> 00:45:29,588
So, I look in,
and there he is on top of her.

713
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:35,698
So I go to my room
and I get my baseball bat.

714
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:38,167
I come back swinging.

715
00:45:41,138 --> 00:45:43,003
He never heard me coming.

716
00:45:44,074 --> 00:45:45,939
I just remember Sally...

717
00:45:47,611 --> 00:45:51,445
hugging her knees, on the corner
ofthat bed, screaming at me to stop it.

718
00:45:51,482 --> 00:45:53,211
I just kept hitting that fucker.

719
00:45:58,021 --> 00:46:00,751
I didn't plan on killing him...

720
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:05,319
but can't say I regret it.

721
00:46:08,699 --> 00:46:10,496
( exhales )

722
00:46:10,567 --> 00:46:13,536
Maybe next time we get together,
we can talk about...

723
00:46:15,506 --> 00:46:16,973
other things.

724
00:46:17,007 --> 00:46:20,875
- The next time?
- Yeah.

725
00:46:20,911 --> 00:46:23,641
I came here to ask you out.

726
00:46:25,082 --> 00:46:27,482
On a date?

727
00:46:29,253 --> 00:46:31,483
Yeah. It's okay, isn't it?

728
00:46:31,522 --> 00:46:35,185
- It's a little weird.
- Well, what's weird about it?

729
00:46:35,225 --> 00:46:37,159
How old are you?

730
00:46:37,194 --> 00:46:38,320
I'm 27.

731
00:46:39,830 --> 00:46:42,697
Yeah, well... ahem--
I'm not 27.

732
00:46:42,733 --> 00:46:44,030
So?

733
00:46:45,736 --> 00:46:47,670
So, I think
you could find someone

734
00:46:47,704 --> 00:46:51,731
a little bit more,
you know, buoyant.

735
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:53,106
I think you're beautiful.

736
00:46:59,416 --> 00:47:02,283
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

737
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:07,886
Before you went away
to the big house...

738
00:47:09,226 --> 00:47:12,195
did you date much?
Did you ever have a girlfriend?

739
00:47:13,430 --> 00:47:14,897
No.

740
00:47:14,932 --> 00:47:16,695
Mm-hmm.

741
00:47:17,734 --> 00:47:22,034
So, it is safe to say
that intimate relationships

742
00:47:22,072 --> 00:47:24,540
are not something
you've had a lot of experience with?

743
00:47:25,876 --> 00:47:28,208
It is safe to say...

744
00:47:30,814 --> 00:47:32,873
I have had absolutely none.

745
00:47:35,919 --> 00:47:37,079
Hmm.

746
00:47:39,056 --> 00:47:40,887
(keys clink )

747
00:47:49,633 --> 00:47:52,659
So, you-- you want to go get
something to eat or something?

748
00:47:52,736 --> 00:47:54,203
I'm not hungry.

749
00:47:54,238 --> 00:47:55,933
Why don't we
just grab a drink?

750
00:47:56,006 --> 00:47:57,439
I'm not thirsty.

751
00:47:57,474 --> 00:47:59,942
Do you wanna
go see a movie?

752
00:47:59,977 --> 00:48:01,706
I don't watch movies.

753
00:48:01,745 --> 00:48:05,613
- We could just go hang out.
- Oh my God, you're persistent.

754
00:48:05,649 --> 00:48:08,447
I've been in prison
for the past 10 years.

755
00:48:08,485 --> 00:48:11,045
Maybe you should
get yourself a hooker.

756
00:48:14,124 --> 00:48:16,558
Jacki, that's not
what I was getting at.

757
00:48:16,593 --> 00:48:19,255
# Tangled up in what's best #

758
00:48:19,296 --> 00:48:22,424
Come on,
I'll give you a ride.

759
00:48:22,466 --> 00:48:23,728
No, I'm just going to walk.

760
00:48:23,767 --> 00:48:26,327
Animal, no one walks in L.A.

761
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:28,462
Well, they do
if they have an expired license.

762
00:48:28,538 --> 00:48:30,233
Either that or take a bus.

763
00:48:30,274 --> 00:48:32,105
Ooh, the shame train.

764
00:48:32,142 --> 00:48:34,906
I don't mind walking.

765
00:48:36,546 --> 00:48:39,413
I'll see you later.

766
00:48:42,019 --> 00:48:46,149
( rock music plays )

767
00:48:49,826 --> 00:48:51,851
( engine starts )

768
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:03,801
Jacki's voice:
Okay, he's a virgin.

769
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:08,436
A convicted murderer virgin,
without a driver's license.

770
00:49:08,478 --> 00:49:10,969
Why am I finding this sexy?

771
00:49:25,862 --> 00:49:27,693
What are you doing here?

772
00:49:27,731 --> 00:49:30,097
I didn't know where else to go.

773
00:49:33,103 --> 00:49:34,866
What happened?

774
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:38,032
Tracy, what happened?

775
00:49:38,108 --> 00:49:39,871
Oh, shit.

776
00:49:41,011 --> 00:49:42,603
Shit.

777
00:49:42,646 --> 00:49:44,841
I don't even know
where to start, dude.

778
00:49:46,883 --> 00:49:49,477
Thank you.

779
00:49:49,519 --> 00:49:51,919
You mind?

780
00:49:51,955 --> 00:49:53,923
No, go ahead.

781
00:50:01,965 --> 00:50:06,265
So, Nick--
he comes over tonight.

782
00:50:06,336 --> 00:50:08,395
Tracy, that drives me crazy.

783
00:50:08,472 --> 00:50:10,099
Can you talk
so I can understand you?

784
00:50:11,641 --> 00:50:13,108
Sorry.

785
00:50:15,779 --> 00:50:17,440
All right.

786
00:50:17,481 --> 00:50:19,312
Nick's been
bugging me for months.

787
00:50:21,918 --> 00:50:25,251
He wanted to do this
whole "rape fantasy" thing.

788
00:50:25,288 --> 00:50:27,415
Jesus, tell me
you didn't go along with that.

789
00:50:27,457 --> 00:50:30,654
I kept telling him no, women don't have
fantasies about being raped,

790
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:33,720
that it's total bullshit, right?
But then it hits me.

791
00:50:33,764 --> 00:50:35,425
I mean,
I kind of did have a fantasy.

792
00:50:35,465 --> 00:50:37,592
I don't want to hear this.

793
00:50:37,667 --> 00:50:40,158
- Just listen.
- I really don't want to hear this.

794
00:50:40,237 --> 00:50:43,138
Jacki, just listen.

795
00:50:46,276 --> 00:50:48,904
I had no idea
when it was going to happen.

796
00:50:48,945 --> 00:50:52,711
So he shows up tonight,
I'm crashed out on my bed,

797
00:50:52,749 --> 00:50:57,118
comes in my room-- he's wearing
a ski mask, gloves, full on--

798
00:50:57,154 --> 00:51:01,488
movie-of-the-week rapist
attire and dialogue--

799
00:51:01,525 --> 00:51:04,119
"Don't say a word,
you won't get hurt."

800
00:51:04,161 --> 00:51:05,856
And I'm playing
the whole victim thing,

801
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:08,091
"Oh, no, please,
please don't hurt me."

802
00:51:08,131 --> 00:51:10,463
Meanwhile, I'm reaching
under my pillow for my gun,

803
00:51:10,534 --> 00:51:12,866
which I've been keeping there
since he became obsessed

804
00:51:12,936 --> 00:51:14,927
with this whole
fucking stupid thing.

805
00:51:15,005 --> 00:51:20,170
So, I point the gun at him,
and I pull off a few rounds, and then--

806
00:51:20,210 --> 00:51:22,974
Wait, wait a minute.
You shot Nick?

807
00:51:23,013 --> 00:51:26,278
Well, yeah.
That was my fantasy.

808
00:51:26,316 --> 00:51:28,181
To kill whoever
tried to rape me.

809
00:51:28,218 --> 00:51:29,879
You killed Nick?

810
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:34,050
Of course not, dude!
What do you think, I'm crazy?

811
00:51:35,492 --> 00:51:39,485
I loaded the gun with blanks,
but he didn't know that.

812
00:51:40,697 --> 00:51:44,656
Tracy, I mean, that--

813
00:51:44,734 --> 00:51:47,635
that's pretty fucking cool.

814
00:51:47,671 --> 00:51:51,937
Once he realized he wasn't dead,
he got really fucking pissed.

815
00:51:51,975 --> 00:51:53,442
No shit!

816
00:51:55,645 --> 00:51:58,170
- ( laughs )
- What's so funny?

817
00:51:59,216 --> 00:52:02,344
Oh, fuck.

818
00:52:02,385 --> 00:52:06,185
He peed his pants
when he thought that I really shot him.

819
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:16,823
He really
fucking scared me, Jacki.

820
00:52:16,867 --> 00:52:19,461
He started talking
all kinds of crazy shit.

821
00:52:19,536 --> 00:52:23,336
And he hit me.
I just got the fuck out of there.

822
00:52:23,373 --> 00:52:25,432
Fuck him.

823
00:52:25,509 --> 00:52:28,239
Rape fantasy.

824
00:52:32,816 --> 00:52:35,250
Can I stay here tonight?

825
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:38,310
Sure.

826
00:52:38,355 --> 00:52:41,017
- Would you do me a favor?
- Hmm?

827
00:52:41,057 --> 00:52:43,582
I don't think
I locked the front door.

828
00:52:43,627 --> 00:52:48,360
My bag is in there,
my credit cards and my cash,

829
00:52:48,398 --> 00:52:51,834
and just-- please.

830
00:52:55,872 --> 00:52:58,136
Give me your keys.

831
00:53:02,946 --> 00:53:05,847
I forgot how much fun it was
hanging out with you.

832
00:53:25,502 --> 00:53:27,163
Great, no straw.

833
00:53:28,638 --> 00:53:30,105
( exhales )

834
00:53:32,409 --> 00:53:34,172
Where's Tracy?

835
00:53:35,212 --> 00:53:38,113
Well, she's not with me.

836
00:53:42,185 --> 00:53:46,713
Does it look like she's with me?
'Cause I don't see her standing here.

837
00:53:47,791 --> 00:53:50,259
Look, Nick, if you guys
are fighting again--

838
00:53:50,293 --> 00:53:53,626
No, we're not fighting.

839
00:53:57,934 --> 00:54:00,664
What do you watch?

840
00:54:00,737 --> 00:54:03,706
- A movie.
- A movie?

841
00:54:06,610 --> 00:54:10,740
What's that smell?
Is that you, Mr. Pissy Pants?

842
00:54:12,716 --> 00:54:15,549
You know what?

843
00:54:19,723 --> 00:54:21,782
I lied.

844
00:54:23,793 --> 00:54:26,125
Tracy is mad at me.

845
00:54:27,264 --> 00:54:30,062
- Do you want to know why?
- No!

846
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:33,467
Look, Nick, you need to go home,
take a shower and go to bed.

847
00:54:33,536 --> 00:54:36,505
I'll call you a cab.
You can wait outside.

848
00:54:36,573 --> 00:54:40,031
Hollywood. Yeah, can I get
the number for Celebrity Cab?

849
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:41,975
Whew!

850
00:54:42,012 --> 00:54:44,537
What's that all about?

851
00:54:44,581 --> 00:54:49,041
Don't make a sound,
and nobody's going to get hurt.

852
00:54:49,085 --> 00:54:51,576
You're a freak,
do you know that?

853
00:54:55,258 --> 00:54:57,317
- ( grunts )
- Nick: Huh?

854
00:54:57,360 --> 00:55:02,161
"Nicky, I used fake bullets!
I thought you'd think it was funny."

855
00:55:02,198 --> 00:55:03,529
Hmm?

856
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:09,299
You mind
if I ask you a question, hmm?

857
00:55:09,372 --> 00:55:11,067
Where the fuck is Tracy?

858
00:55:11,107 --> 00:55:14,338
- Huh?! Where's my fucking girlfriend?
- I don't know!

859
00:55:14,377 --> 00:55:15,639
I think you know.

860
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:19,644
( screaming )

861
00:55:19,683 --> 00:55:21,981
Nick:
What's the deal?!

862
00:55:22,018 --> 00:55:24,009
( crying )
No!

863
00:55:30,126 --> 00:55:31,684
( door creaks )

864
00:55:39,135 --> 00:55:41,262
Sally?

865
00:55:44,341 --> 00:55:48,675
Oh, shit! Sally, sh--
oh, sh-- oh, baby!
