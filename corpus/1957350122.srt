1
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:42,907
You following the primaries?

2
00:05:43,038 --> 00:05:46,215
-Yeah. Hillary Clinton's not
man enough to be president.

3
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:49,044
And this Obama guy is?

4
00:05:49,174 --> 00:05:51,829
-Jenn, meet Beau,
our senior vice president.

5
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,527
-Pleasure, pleasure.

6
00:05:53,657 --> 00:05:55,180
-Happy Birthday.

7
00:05:55,311 --> 00:05:58,532
-It's not for
a couple more days, but thanks.

8
00:05:58,662 --> 00:06:01,230
-I know you
from your college-football days.

9
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,841
I spent some time
in the Bay Area.

10
00:06:03,972 --> 00:06:06,017
You were quite a thing
at Stanford.

11
00:06:06,148 --> 00:06:07,454
-Making me sound like
a has-been.

12
00:06:07,584 --> 00:06:09,412
No, that's not what I meant.

13
00:06:09,543 --> 00:06:11,153
- My God.
- I could've gone pro.

14
00:06:11,283 --> 00:06:12,981
- Yeah?
- Football or baseball.

15
00:06:13,111 --> 00:06:15,766
Edward offered me more, so...

16
00:06:15,897 --> 00:06:18,073
-Whoa, is that the iPhone?

17
00:06:18,203 --> 00:06:19,596
-I got mine, too.

18
00:06:19,727 --> 00:06:21,598
This is a prototype.

19
00:06:21,729 --> 00:06:22,773
Not your ordinary iPhone.

20
00:06:22,904 --> 00:06:25,036
Gift from Edward.
- Ooh, wow.

21
00:08:14,929 --> 00:08:17,497
Dickie.

22
00:08:17,627 --> 00:08:20,238
What a surprise.

23
00:08:20,369 --> 00:08:23,503
- No shit. Dickie Boca.
- In all these years,

24
00:08:23,633 --> 00:08:26,418
I don't recall ever seeing you
at one of our quarterlies.

25
00:08:26,549 --> 00:08:29,247
- Abby.
- This is history.

26
00:08:29,378 --> 00:08:31,554
-Sounds like a reason
to celebrate.

27
00:08:31,685 --> 00:08:33,208
-My colleague doesn't
really drink,

28
00:08:33,338 --> 00:08:36,472
but maybe tonight
on such a rare occasion...

29
00:08:36,603 --> 00:08:37,995
-Here. Let me.

30
00:08:41,912 --> 00:08:44,611
- Please. Join us.
- Abby.

31
00:08:44,741 --> 00:08:46,177
-To you, Richard.

32
00:08:50,834 --> 00:08:54,490
This is Richard,
my golden goose.

33
00:08:54,621 --> 00:08:56,492
-Hi, Richard. I'm Lena.

34
00:08:56,623 --> 00:08:59,016
Dickie,
need a hand with that?

35
00:09:02,106 --> 00:09:06,067
-And that would make you Jack...
or the giant?

36
00:09:08,286 --> 00:09:10,201
"Golden goose."

37
00:09:10,332 --> 00:09:12,813
Isn't that from
"Jack and the Beanstalk"?

38
00:09:12,943 --> 00:09:17,861
-Well, in that case,
I'm the giant.

39
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:23,301
-You two,
stay out of trouble.

40
00:09:26,348 --> 00:09:29,786
Hey, Beau,
I'd like to tell you something.

41
00:09:29,917 --> 00:09:31,701
-Birds of a feather.

42
00:10:07,258 --> 00:10:10,958
-Bartender, let me get
two bottles of Cristal.

43
00:10:11,088 --> 00:10:13,395
Hey, want a dab of MDMA?

44
00:10:13,525 --> 00:10:15,876
Hey.

45
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:19,156
What brought you out tonight?

46
00:11:41,309 --> 00:11:43,050
-Miss.

47
00:11:46,401 --> 00:11:48,882
Welcome home, Mr. Boca.

48
00:12:46,504 --> 00:12:49,029
Shit.

49
00:12:49,159 --> 00:12:51,814
This is some view.

50
00:12:55,122 --> 00:12:57,124
But a bit stark
on the decor.

51
00:13:13,749 --> 00:13:17,361
There. That's better.

52
00:13:17,492 --> 00:13:21,888
And this chair should go
over there.

53
00:13:35,292 --> 00:13:38,513
Sumsum,
I hope you're okay.

54
00:13:53,267 --> 00:13:56,400
My cat ran away today.

55
00:13:56,531 --> 00:13:59,969
She's out there
somewhere.

56
00:15:29,885 --> 00:15:31,800
-I helped myself
to some water.

57
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,893
What's all this about?

58
00:15:45,683 --> 00:15:49,122
-Let me guess...
A gift from Edward?

59
00:15:51,689 --> 00:15:54,823
He admires you.

60
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:58,783
-He admires
what I do for him.

61
00:15:58,914 --> 00:16:02,222
Yeah. Golden goose.

62
00:16:02,352 --> 00:16:04,702
I got that.

63
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:07,531
So what is it that you do?

64
00:16:07,662 --> 00:16:09,142
-Quant trading.

65
00:16:09,272 --> 00:16:11,622
-Wall Street?

66
00:16:11,753 --> 00:16:13,711
Savage sport.

67
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:18,194
So, what,

68
00:16:18,325 --> 00:16:19,630
you guys think
you're matadors?

69
00:16:19,761 --> 00:16:22,459
-No, if anything,
I'm... I'm a spectator.

70
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:26,420
-I think you're more in the ring
than you'd like to admit.

71
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:28,944
-I just design the models.

72
00:16:29,075 --> 00:16:31,816
-So you're the math guy.

73
00:16:31,947 --> 00:16:37,213
-Yeah, um...
math and code.

74
00:16:37,344 --> 00:16:40,260
Well, I synthesize and weigh
a very large number

75
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:45,221
of different types of evidence,
and, using certain metrics,

76
00:16:45,352 --> 00:16:47,919
I hope to anticipate
what'll happen next.

77
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:51,706
So you know
what's going to happen next?

78
00:16:54,926 --> 00:16:56,624
-No.

79
00:16:56,754 --> 00:17:00,671
But my models do.

80
00:17:00,802 --> 00:17:02,630
-How'd you get into that?

81
00:17:04,719 --> 00:17:06,329
-Do you really want to know?

82
00:17:09,158 --> 00:17:11,291
Bees.

83
00:17:11,421 --> 00:17:14,990
-Bees?
Like honeybees?

84
00:17:15,121 --> 00:17:18,994
-My thesis was on how bee
colony collapse disorder

85
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:22,432
would cripple California's
almond production.

86
00:17:22,563 --> 00:17:24,260
Turns out, it did.

87
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:28,264
That's similar
to what I'm studying.

88
00:17:28,395 --> 00:17:30,136
Being around winemakers
and viticulturists

89
00:17:30,266 --> 00:17:32,660
got me thinking
about sustainability,

90
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:35,837
which eventually made me
take an interest in water.

91
00:17:35,967 --> 00:17:38,013
That's my concentration.

92
00:17:38,144 --> 00:17:41,886
- Water.
- So what happened to the bees?

93
00:17:42,017 --> 00:17:43,453
-They vanished.

94
00:17:43,584 --> 00:17:46,152
-What do you mean, vanished?

95
00:17:46,282 --> 00:17:47,936
Like, died?

96
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,764
-No. No, vanished.

97
00:17:49,894 --> 00:17:53,681
Like, nobody knows.

98
00:17:53,811 --> 00:17:55,857
-And you didn't try
to figure it out?

99
00:17:58,816 --> 00:18:02,777
-Well, that's not what my models
are programmed to do.

100
00:18:10,524 --> 00:18:14,615
Like... like you,
I-I study ecosystems.

101
00:18:14,745 --> 00:18:17,139
Our Earth is
4.6 billion years old.

102
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:18,967
So we can
gather inferential data

103
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:21,317
based on
what's happened before.

104
00:18:21,448 --> 00:18:23,102
Then I... then I program
the algorithms

105
00:18:23,232 --> 00:18:24,929
based on these findings,
and they... they learn

106
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:27,367
from their environments.

107
00:18:27,497 --> 00:18:29,325
So they're adaptive.
They... They... They...

108
00:18:29,456 --> 00:18:32,111
They can be applied to...
To most anything.

109
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:39,118
But they're...
They're predictors.

110
00:18:41,642 --> 00:18:44,601
They're not
mystery solvers.

111
00:18:51,347 --> 00:18:53,567
Um...

112
00:18:53,697 --> 00:18:57,136
I recently did one for wine.

113
00:18:57,266 --> 00:19:00,269
-But you don't drink.

114
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,967
No.

115
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,493
No, I collect.

116
00:19:33,781 --> 00:19:35,826
This is the wrong one.

117
00:19:35,957 --> 00:19:37,350
-What?

118
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,482
-I own the whole floor.

119
00:19:39,613 --> 00:19:42,572
You can't be serious.

120
00:19:42,703 --> 00:19:45,053
-Yeah.

121
00:19:58,109 --> 00:20:00,851
Velcome to my cell.

122
00:20:04,551 --> 00:20:06,857
-Freezing in here.

123
00:20:15,866 --> 00:20:17,259
Wow.

124
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:20,175
You weren't kidding.

125
00:20:20,306 --> 00:20:23,091
-Edward always told me high-end
wine offered bond-like security

126
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:25,789
with stock-like returns.

127
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:29,140
It turns out,
he was right.

128
00:20:29,271 --> 00:20:32,231
It doesn't correlate
to other asset classes.

129
00:20:35,016 --> 00:20:36,670
Pick anything you'd like.

130
00:20:45,809 --> 00:20:47,028
-One day,
when I'm all grown up,

131
00:20:47,158 --> 00:20:49,465
I'll have a place
just like this.

132
00:20:49,596 --> 00:20:52,120
I don't mean
the whole floor.

133
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,035
Just this unit would do.

134
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:07,483
Except my place will have
more than just one glass.

135
00:21:07,614 --> 00:21:09,485
And a decanter.

136
00:21:13,576 --> 00:21:15,578
-What do I do?

137
00:21:15,709 --> 00:21:17,319
-You drink it.

138
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:19,495
But smell it first.

139
00:21:21,236 --> 00:21:22,411
Here.

140
00:21:22,542 --> 00:21:24,152
Loosen up.

141
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:26,807
This is meant to be fun.

142
00:21:26,937 --> 00:21:28,243
-You're good at this.

143
00:21:28,374 --> 00:21:29,984
-It's just something
that comes easy,

144
00:21:30,114 --> 00:21:31,942
and it helps pay the bills.

145
00:21:32,073 --> 00:21:34,162
At least until
I get myself through school.

146
00:21:36,425 --> 00:21:39,080
-What are you going to do
with a background in water?

147
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:43,780
-Um...

148
00:21:43,911 --> 00:21:46,174
I don't know.

149
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:48,350
You strayed pretty far
from bees.

150
00:21:52,093 --> 00:21:53,355
I don't want to be managing
a wine bar

151
00:21:53,486 --> 00:21:55,183
for the rest of my life.

152
00:21:58,229 --> 00:22:01,407
Maybe some form
of artificial recharge.

153
00:22:01,537 --> 00:22:04,627
All I know is our current model
of progress is unsustainable.

154
00:22:09,066 --> 00:22:10,590
So?

155
00:22:17,771 --> 00:22:19,163
-It's all the same.

156
00:22:19,294 --> 00:22:21,992
Come on. Try.

157
00:22:24,865 --> 00:22:27,607
Cherries, currants, earth.

158
00:22:27,737 --> 00:22:29,478
A week-old sock.

159
00:22:29,609 --> 00:22:31,567
First thing that pops
into your head.

160
00:22:40,054 --> 00:22:43,536
-I don't know.

161
00:22:43,666 --> 00:22:44,972
Grapes.

162
00:22:47,453 --> 00:22:49,672
-What?

163
00:22:49,803 --> 00:22:52,371
-It's corked.

164
00:22:52,501 --> 00:22:55,852
-What?

165
00:22:55,983 --> 00:22:57,767
-The wine.

166
00:22:57,898 --> 00:22:59,682
It's corked.

167
00:23:02,424 --> 00:23:04,774
You do know what that means?

168
00:23:04,905 --> 00:23:09,039
-Yes, um, TCA tainting.

169
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:11,520
Are you sure?

170
00:23:11,651 --> 00:23:13,479
-Quite.

171
00:23:18,484 --> 00:23:20,355
Should we grab another one?

172
00:23:27,362 --> 00:23:29,669
What's that?

173
00:23:31,671 --> 00:23:33,412
-That alarm?

174
00:23:38,112 --> 00:23:39,809
This is when I wake up.

175
00:24:15,628 --> 00:24:19,327
It's okay, Richard.

176
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:21,460
You have to learn
to let things go.

177
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:30,381
I should see
if my cat's back.

178
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,867
Thanks for the company.

179
00:24:44,047 --> 00:24:45,527
Bye.

180
00:27:05,362 --> 00:27:07,277
-Do you see Murdoch

181
00:27:07,408 --> 00:27:09,540
as taking a different approach
withThe Wall Street Journal,

182
00:27:09,671 --> 00:27:11,630
which, of course, is a very
different kind of newspaper

183
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,457
than theNew York Post?
- Well, I think it should be

184
00:27:13,588 --> 00:27:15,416
noted that his brand
of revitalization

185
00:27:15,546 --> 00:27:17,157
with theNew York Post
includes it losing

186
00:27:17,287 --> 00:27:18,941
tens of millions of dollars.

187
00:27:19,072 --> 00:27:21,422
So News Corp is big enough
to absorb the losses

188
00:27:21,552 --> 00:27:23,990
that he has, with...
With theNew York Post

189
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,166
and the... the losses he had
for many years

190
00:27:26,296 --> 00:27:28,037
with Fox News Corporation.

191
00:27:28,168 --> 00:27:30,518
I mean, what we've seen from
Murdoch's news properties,

192
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:32,476
for example, just watching
Fox News within the last year,

193
00:27:32,607 --> 00:27:34,696
we've learned that Mark Foley
is a Democrat,

194
00:27:34,827 --> 00:27:36,437
Barack Obama went to a madrasa,

195
00:27:36,567 --> 00:27:38,700
and there were weapons
of mass destruction in Iraq.

196
00:27:38,831 --> 00:27:41,747
I think he has a broader agenda
to try to really degrade

197
00:27:41,877 --> 00:27:43,618
the idea of news,
degrade reporting,

198
00:27:43,749 --> 00:27:45,489
and degrade journalism
so that journalism stands

199
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:48,144
at the same level as the kind
of political message,

200
00:27:48,275 --> 00:27:50,581
political propaganda he likes
to push through his properties.

201
00:27:50,712 --> 00:27:52,496
-Well, the thing
about Mark Foley

202
00:27:52,627 --> 00:27:54,411
being a Democrat was a mistake,
and we all make mistakes...

203
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:59,112
...in that taped interview,
is there a positive side

204
00:27:59,242 --> 00:28:00,722
to Murdoch taking over
The Wall Street Journal

205
00:28:00,853 --> 00:28:02,376
because he's going to pour
money into it.

206
00:28:05,509 --> 00:28:07,381
-This at a time when...

207
00:28:09,644 --> 00:28:12,386
...buying out
or laying off employees.

208
00:28:12,516 --> 00:28:14,388
-Well, I think the hope
is that Rupert Murdoch

209
00:28:14,518 --> 00:28:16,259
not only will put more money
intoThe Journal,

210
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:18,566
but that he'll also
leverage that brand.

211
00:29:53,443 --> 00:29:55,402
-If you don't mind,
I could do the news for you.

212
00:29:55,532 --> 00:29:57,099
-I thought you were just
going to tidy up her hair

213
00:29:57,230 --> 00:29:58,709
and put a little makeup
on her, but...

214
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,233
She looked great,
as... as well.

215
00:30:02,844 --> 00:30:05,020
-Come on.
I can't believe...

216
00:30:05,151 --> 00:30:08,371
-You can't prove
that I did any of that.

217
00:30:10,547 --> 00:30:11,810
-Hey, everyone,
and welcome to

218
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:13,376
a special edition
of "This Week."

219
00:30:13,507 --> 00:30:15,204
We're here
at Drake University

220
00:30:15,335 --> 00:30:17,990
for the first debate
of this presidential campaign.

221
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:20,296
All nine Republican candidates
for president

222
00:30:20,427 --> 00:30:23,038
are with us,
and let's get right to them.

223
00:30:23,169 --> 00:30:26,302
And here, the front-runner
at 26%, Mitt Romney,

224
00:30:26,433 --> 00:30:28,217
former governor
of Massachusetts.

225
00:30:28,348 --> 00:30:32,004
Former mayor of New York,
Rudy Giuliani's next at 14%.

226
00:30:32,134 --> 00:30:35,311
Mike Huckabee, former governor
of Arkansas, is at 8%.

227
00:30:35,442 --> 00:30:38,793
Also at 8%, Senator John McCain
of Arizona.

228
00:30:38,924 --> 00:30:40,969
Kansas Senator Sam Brownback
is at 5%.

229
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:44,581
-The word "mosquito" derives
from the Spanish word,

230
00:30:44,712 --> 00:30:46,627
"little fly."

231
00:30:46,757 --> 00:30:50,544
The mosquito's life-span
depends on a few factors...

232
00:30:50,674 --> 00:30:55,201
Temperature, humidity, sex,
and time of year.

233
00:30:55,331 --> 00:30:57,986
For mosquitoes to thrive,
they need an environment

234
00:30:58,117 --> 00:31:00,075
with a sustained
water supply,

235
00:31:00,206 --> 00:31:03,339
feeding hosts...
Nectar or honeydew,

236
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:05,864
from which
they can extract sugar.

237
00:31:05,994 --> 00:31:09,345
The mosquito goes through
four stages of development...

238
00:31:09,476 --> 00:31:14,002
The egg, the larva,
the pupa,

239
00:31:14,133 --> 00:31:16,526
and, finally,
the adult mosquito,

240
00:31:16,657 --> 00:31:19,355
also known as the imago.

241
00:31:19,486 --> 00:31:22,532
The female mosquito has
a syringe-like proboscis

242
00:31:22,663 --> 00:31:26,101
that is used to puncture
the skin of its host,

243
00:31:26,232 --> 00:31:30,018
which it uses to obtain protein
to produce eggs.

244
00:31:30,149 --> 00:31:33,500
This is known
as the blood meal.

245
00:31:50,865 --> 00:31:52,432
-Hi, Sally.

246
00:31:52,562 --> 00:31:56,479
Can you get me the invite
list from Friday's party,

247
00:31:56,610 --> 00:31:59,134
the names and phone numbers?

248
00:31:59,265 --> 00:32:01,093
If you have it handy,
please e-mail it

249
00:32:01,223 --> 00:32:05,749
or have it ready for me
first thing tomorrow.

250
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,360
Thanks.

251
00:32:43,526 --> 00:32:46,877
How's this for
a fucking birthday gift?

252
00:32:47,008 --> 00:32:49,793
Barry Bonds' baseball bat.

253
00:32:49,924 --> 00:32:52,535
Game bat on top of that.

254
00:32:52,666 --> 00:32:54,929
First base side,
finger-blasting Bing's mom,

255
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:56,931
catching fly balls.

256
00:32:57,062 --> 00:32:59,542
It's fucking awesome.

257
00:32:59,673 --> 00:33:02,632
-Fucking Petco going nuts.

258
00:33:02,763 --> 00:33:04,983
Ooh, hey.
Damn, Dickie.

259
00:33:05,113 --> 00:33:06,375
Hate to see
what she looks like.

260
00:33:16,298 --> 00:33:17,647
-Good morning, Mr. Boca.

261
00:33:17,778 --> 00:33:19,519
-Good morning, Sally.

262
00:33:36,579 --> 00:33:40,279
-Sir, do you need anything?

263
00:33:40,409 --> 00:33:42,237
-No, I'm fine.

264
00:33:42,368 --> 00:33:44,979
Just that list, Sally.

265
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:47,634
-Okay.

266
00:33:55,598 --> 00:33:58,732
Joey, look alive.

267
00:33:58,862 --> 00:34:01,909
Casanova, you going to tell me
what the fuck happened?

268
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,303
No, look at this swing.

269
00:34:04,433 --> 00:34:08,307
-This... this volatility.
My... My model went berserk.

270
00:34:08,437 --> 00:34:11,092
No, have you... have you seen
anything out of the ordinary?

271
00:34:11,223 --> 00:34:13,660
-Pbht. Other than you leaving
with that girl

272
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:16,097
from the party and your face?

273
00:34:16,228 --> 00:34:19,448
-But look at this interval.

274
00:34:19,579 --> 00:34:22,408
-Yeah,
that's self-corrected.

275
00:34:22,538 --> 00:34:24,323
Market gyration.

276
00:34:24,453 --> 00:34:26,673
-W-Which briefly erased
half a trillion dollars

277
00:34:26,803 --> 00:34:29,893
in market value?
- Maybe it's latency.

278
00:34:30,024 --> 00:34:32,505
- Latency?
- Yep.

279
00:34:32,635 --> 00:34:34,811
-That's what
you're going with?

280
00:34:34,942 --> 00:34:36,944
- Yeah.
- No, I've factored in

281
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:39,947
how long it takes to send
and receive orders.

282
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:42,471
Our quotes adjust
for heavy loads.

283
00:34:42,602 --> 00:34:43,864
No, sigma events,
they... they...

284
00:34:43,994 --> 00:34:45,648
They don't look like this.
- Okay,

285
00:34:45,779 --> 00:34:47,302
you tell me what it is,
smart guy.

286
00:34:47,433 --> 00:34:52,090
I think it's liquidity shocks.

287
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:55,745
No, but I'm not seeing
any evidence.

288
00:34:55,876 --> 00:34:58,052
No, what are you seeing
in the flow?

289
00:34:58,183 --> 00:35:00,185
-Everything, Dickie.

290
00:35:00,315 --> 00:35:02,665
-Y-Y-You're confusing my model.

291
00:35:02,796 --> 00:35:04,972
-Dumbest smart guy I ever saw.

292
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:07,714
-No, this c... this could... this
could fuck up the whole market.

293
00:35:07,844 --> 00:35:10,151
-I'm doing
what everyone else is,

294
00:35:10,282 --> 00:35:12,153
except I'm doing it better.

295
00:35:19,334 --> 00:35:23,338
Fuck basketball.

296
00:35:23,469 --> 00:35:24,905
-In the hunt
for Osama bin Laden,

297
00:35:25,035 --> 00:35:27,647
there's apparently
been little progress.

298
00:35:27,777 --> 00:35:29,257
Afghan president...

299
00:35:57,242 --> 00:35:58,895
Yeah.

300
00:36:00,201 --> 00:36:01,811
Okay, then.

301
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:06,338
It was nice to see you
at the party on Friday.

302
00:36:06,468 --> 00:36:09,689
How was the end
of yournight?

303
00:36:09,819 --> 00:36:12,126
-Fine.

304
00:36:12,257 --> 00:36:13,910
If you don't mind, um...

305
00:36:26,227 --> 00:36:28,316
-W-What am I looking at here?

306
00:36:28,447 --> 00:36:31,624
-Have you heard
the term "runaway world"?

307
00:36:31,754 --> 00:36:35,062
Now, we've entered a realm
where, because of the speed,

308
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:36,542
volume, and complexity,

309
00:36:36,672 --> 00:36:38,718
this thing,
it's no longer human-readable.

310
00:36:38,848 --> 00:36:41,373
No, this is a young,
highly impressionable system

311
00:36:41,503 --> 00:36:44,245
and... and we're polluting it.
- Calm down.

312
00:36:44,376 --> 00:36:46,029
-I don't understand
what's going on with the market,

313
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,336
and that's very disconcerting.
- Beau told me.

314
00:36:48,467 --> 00:36:49,990
-Yeah, Beau's a part
of the problem.

315
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,296
-Mnh.

316
00:36:51,426 --> 00:36:54,473
This competitiveness is good.

317
00:36:54,603 --> 00:36:58,216
Your encoded trading rules,
his leadership and savvy,

318
00:36:58,346 --> 00:37:00,479
but you can't go
around accusing...

319
00:37:00,609 --> 00:37:02,655
-It'll take me the better part
of two days to figure out

320
00:37:02,785 --> 00:37:05,658
what happened in those... those
few billionths of a second.

321
00:37:05,788 --> 00:37:07,877
And this thing is happening with
greater and greater frequency.

322
00:37:08,008 --> 00:37:09,488
I-I can't keep up.

323
00:37:09,618 --> 00:37:11,707
-Well, if you can't,
no one else can.

324
00:37:13,492 --> 00:37:15,407
Is that supposed to
reassure me?

325
00:37:17,278 --> 00:37:20,150
Listen,
I-I'm not going to pretend

326
00:37:20,281 --> 00:37:24,764
I know how Honeybee works,
but it does.

327
00:37:24,894 --> 00:37:27,636
The proof is in our P&Ls.

328
00:37:27,767 --> 00:37:31,074
And I know I sleep well
at night.

329
00:37:31,205 --> 00:37:33,468
-Well, at least someone does.

330
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:40,823
No, we need to go offline.

331
00:37:43,696 --> 00:37:44,697
-Do you mean?

332
00:37:44,827 --> 00:37:46,264
-Stop trading.

333
00:37:46,394 --> 00:37:48,178
I'm serious.

334
00:37:48,309 --> 00:37:49,745
W-W-We have crossed
some sort of Rubicon...

335
00:37:49,876 --> 00:37:51,269
-If we stop, we die.

336
00:37:51,399 --> 00:37:54,750
-Which, by its very definition,
is an arms race.

337
00:37:54,881 --> 00:37:59,277
-If it is, then we are the
U.S. of fucking A, my friend.

338
00:38:01,844 --> 00:38:05,544
-What I'm talking about
is a cascading ripple

339
00:38:05,674 --> 00:38:08,634
that could destabilize
the entire market.

340
00:38:08,764 --> 00:38:11,463
And if there's a fire...

341
00:38:11,593 --> 00:38:15,510
No. Whenthere was a fire,

342
00:38:15,641 --> 00:38:18,034
we all have to get out
the same door.

343
00:38:18,165 --> 00:38:21,777
-Well,
now you can make sure

344
00:38:21,908 --> 00:38:24,563
we are the ones
closest to the door.

345
00:40:15,848 --> 00:40:18,416
Edward?

346
00:40:18,546 --> 00:40:19,939
What are you doing here?

347
00:40:20,069 --> 00:40:21,680
-Shh.

348
00:40:39,524 --> 00:40:41,613
Olé!

349
00:40:41,743 --> 00:40:44,180
Olé! Olé!

350
00:40:44,311 --> 00:40:45,704
-Lena!

351
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:54,903
-Hi. You've reached Lena.
Please leave a message.

352
00:41:55,034 --> 00:41:58,646
-Hi, Lena.
It's Richard Boca.

353
00:41:58,777 --> 00:42:00,996
I had a dream
about you last night.

354
00:42:01,127 --> 00:42:02,520
Um...

355
00:42:14,662 --> 00:42:19,667
Hi, Lena.
It's Richard, Boca.

356
00:42:19,798 --> 00:42:21,669
W-we met at a party
on Friday,

357
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:24,933
and... and then went back
to my place.

358
00:42:25,064 --> 00:42:26,674
You... You asked
what brought me out,

359
00:42:26,805 --> 00:42:28,937
and, well, you see,

360
00:42:29,068 --> 00:42:32,027
we don't celebrate birthdays
at the office.

361
00:42:32,158 --> 00:42:34,943
Um, we do a-a kind
of joint thing

362
00:42:35,074 --> 00:42:37,206
at our...
At our quarterlies.

363
00:42:37,337 --> 00:42:38,860
I never go.

364
00:42:38,991 --> 00:42:41,863
You know, I don't...
I don't like the attention.

365
00:42:41,994 --> 00:42:45,954
But, um, this one fell
on my actual birthday.

366
00:42:47,782 --> 00:42:49,567
And you made it a great one.

367
00:42:52,831 --> 00:42:55,442
I'm... I'm sorry
if I... I frightened you.

368
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:59,359
It's just that TCA tainting
can be as high as 9.7%

369
00:42:59,489 --> 00:43:02,971
and... and the mead about 3.5%.

370
00:43:03,102 --> 00:43:05,408
But what really upset me
was...

371
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:19,379
Hi, Lena.
It's... It's Richard.

372
00:43:19,509 --> 00:43:22,948
I'm...
I'm sorry about the wine.

373
00:43:23,078 --> 00:43:26,734
I, it was...
It was very late night.

374
00:43:28,083 --> 00:43:30,433
I just wanted it to be perfect.

375
00:43:31,870 --> 00:43:35,525
Um, I'd like to open
another bottle with you.

376
00:43:38,659 --> 00:43:42,097
I hope you found your cat.

377
00:43:42,228 --> 00:43:44,447
Than... Thanks for listening.

378
00:45:05,050 --> 00:45:06,791
-You were involved
in the question, as well.

379
00:45:06,921 --> 00:45:09,402
-I don't think this is
just a Republican problem.

380
00:45:09,532 --> 00:45:12,840
I think this is a problem
that spans the parties.

381
00:45:12,971 --> 00:45:14,668
And we don't just need
a change

382
00:45:14,799 --> 00:45:16,235
in political parties
in Washington.

383
00:45:16,365 --> 00:45:18,977
We've got to have
a change in attitudes

384
00:45:19,107 --> 00:45:21,457
of those who are representing
the people of Ameri...

385
00:45:21,588 --> 00:45:23,808
-Inside is
the dreaded boardroom,

386
00:45:23,938 --> 00:45:27,986
where each week
somebody will be fired.

387
00:45:28,116 --> 00:45:29,683
-Hi, Daddy.

388
00:45:29,814 --> 00:45:31,816
Daddy's coming home.

389
00:45:31,946 --> 00:45:33,643
- Hi, honey.
- Say, "Hi, Daddy."

390
00:45:33,774 --> 00:45:36,472
-The tri-state area
is under a mosquito advisory

391
00:45:36,603 --> 00:45:38,779
after reported cases
of West Nile virus

392
00:45:38,910 --> 00:45:40,999
have surfaced
at local hospitals.

393
00:45:41,129 --> 00:45:44,263
It's recommended that you
not keep standing water around.

394
00:45:44,393 --> 00:45:47,309
There are no reported cases
of the deadlier encephalitis

395
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:49,007
or malaria viruses.

396
00:45:49,137 --> 00:45:51,357
This chart shows
just how severe

397
00:45:51,487 --> 00:45:53,751
a mosquito outbreak
could be.

398
00:45:57,102 --> 00:46:00,801
We're looking at the world's
deadliest animals to humans.

399
00:46:04,674 --> 00:46:06,111
-Dogs?
They shouldn't be on there.

400
00:46:06,241 --> 00:46:08,026
Who doesn't love dogs?

401
00:46:08,156 --> 00:46:11,856
-The fact is, mosquitoes kill
twice as many people as...

402
00:46:32,137 --> 00:46:34,574
-Welcome to the world,
little guy.

403
00:47:59,877 --> 00:48:01,661
Just give me a moment.

404
00:49:55,383 --> 00:49:57,516
What?

405
00:49:57,646 --> 00:49:59,735
-I know what
you're fucking doing.

406
00:49:59,866 --> 00:50:01,607
-What, making us
fucking money?

407
00:50:01,737 --> 00:50:05,306
-Look. Look!

408
00:50:05,437 --> 00:50:07,352
-Dickie, you honestly believe
anything we do

409
00:50:07,482 --> 00:50:09,180
can affect
the overall market?

410
00:50:09,310 --> 00:50:11,791
-Do you think we're too small?
Have you ever slept with...

411
00:50:11,921 --> 00:50:15,403
-Dude, just focus on
back-testing and optimization.

412
00:50:15,534 --> 00:50:18,928
You doknow what
your objective is, right?

413
00:50:19,059 --> 00:50:21,496
Look right here,
where I bottomed.

414
00:50:21,627 --> 00:50:24,456
See that?
Why were we sitting out?!

415
00:50:24,586 --> 00:50:27,198
-Because the model panicked!

416
00:50:27,328 --> 00:50:30,810
Because it's sending it
into feedback loops!

417
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:33,595
I'm warning you.
I'm warning you.

418
00:50:33,726 --> 00:50:34,727
-Put the fucking bat down.

419
00:50:34,857 --> 00:50:36,250
-You stop fucking with it.

420
00:50:36,381 --> 00:50:37,730
-Put the fucking bat down

421
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:39,340
before I break
your little freakazoid ass.

422
00:50:39,471 --> 00:50:41,255
-No, I'm calling Edward.

423
00:50:41,386 --> 00:50:43,344
You are out. Done.

424
00:50:43,475 --> 00:50:46,260
-Call Edward. Great idea.
Easy, Dickie.

425
00:50:46,391 --> 00:50:48,567
-Don't fucking call me that.
No! No!

426
00:50:48,697 --> 00:50:49,655
No!

427
00:50:49,785 --> 00:50:52,310
- Mr. Boca, please.
- No.

428
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:53,876
-Try to calm down.

429
00:51:04,017 --> 00:51:06,324
Mr. Boca.

430
00:51:06,454 --> 00:51:08,369
-Okay.

431
00:51:20,164 --> 00:51:22,775
Have you seen
my dry-erase board?

432
00:51:22,905 --> 00:51:24,690
Dear, Mr. Boca.

433
00:51:24,820 --> 00:51:28,737
You have been
working yourself too hard.

434
00:51:28,868 --> 00:51:30,478
Have you seen a doctor?

435
00:51:30,609 --> 00:51:32,176
-For what?

436
00:51:32,306 --> 00:51:33,829
-I-I could find someone
to see you today.

437
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:36,615
-Just find my fucking
dry-erase board?

438
00:51:36,745 --> 00:51:39,966
-What if I could find someone
who made house calls?

439
00:51:41,489 --> 00:51:45,102
-Do you realize
my responsibility,

440
00:51:45,232 --> 00:51:48,192
the pressure that I'm under?

441
00:51:48,322 --> 00:51:52,848
Where would this company be
without me, without mymodel?

442
00:51:54,546 --> 00:51:55,982
Do you know what would happen
to this company

443
00:51:56,113 --> 00:51:59,246
if my model were to fail?

444
00:51:59,377 --> 00:52:02,336
Do you?
- Mr. Werner and Mr. Harris...

445
00:52:02,467 --> 00:52:03,772
Beau.

446
00:52:03,903 --> 00:52:06,688
Do you think he'sgoing
to fix this?

447
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:11,737
Have you not been
paying attention?

448
00:52:16,220 --> 00:52:18,700
I'm starting to think that

449
00:52:18,831 --> 00:52:22,356
they're all working
against me.

450
00:52:22,487 --> 00:52:23,923
Close the door.

451
00:52:24,053 --> 00:52:26,186
Close the door.
I want you to hear this.

452
00:52:28,884 --> 00:52:30,625
Come here. Come.

453
00:52:30,756 --> 00:52:33,454
Listen.

454
00:52:33,585 --> 00:52:35,674
Do you hear it?

455
00:52:37,632 --> 00:52:40,766
-Buzzzzzzzzzzz.

456
00:52:40,896 --> 00:52:42,768
No, do you hear it?

457
00:52:44,335 --> 00:52:47,947
I'm not the one
that needs a doctor.

458
00:52:48,077 --> 00:52:51,342
I can feel it
on the hair of my arms,

459
00:52:51,472 --> 00:52:55,084
and they're talking to me,
Sally.

460
00:52:55,215 --> 00:52:58,044
Do you hear it?

461
00:52:58,175 --> 00:53:00,742
- Please.
- Just listen.

462
00:53:00,873 --> 00:53:04,224
Do you know what they're saying,
Sally?

463
00:53:04,355 --> 00:53:07,184
- No.
- Of course not.

464
00:53:07,314 --> 00:53:10,230
Nor does Edward, but I do.

465
00:53:10,361 --> 00:53:12,319
That is 10,000 trades a minute,

466
00:53:12,450 --> 00:53:16,018
166 2/3 trades a second,

467
00:53:16,149 --> 00:53:19,239
and it's in need
of my constant care.

468
00:53:19,370 --> 00:53:21,937
So if you'll excuse me,

469
00:53:22,068 --> 00:53:26,246
I am in the middle of
a very important conversation.

470
00:53:26,377 --> 00:53:28,988
Be sure not
to interrupt us again.

471
00:58:32,987 --> 00:58:34,380
...at Tuesday's open

472
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:36,600
in the wake of the biggest
one-day gains

473
00:58:36,730 --> 00:58:38,471
for the Dow Jones
Industrial Average

474
00:58:38,602 --> 00:58:40,168
in nearly five years

475
00:58:40,299 --> 00:58:41,692
as investors await news

476
00:58:41,822 --> 00:58:44,216
from the Federal Reserve
on interest rates.

477
00:58:44,346 --> 00:58:46,174
-We have some breaking news
coming in.

478
00:58:46,305 --> 00:58:49,177
For that, we throw it over
to Marlon at the sports desk.

479
00:58:49,308 --> 00:58:51,266
-Thanks, Cindy.

480
00:58:51,397 --> 00:58:53,138
Barry Bonds
of the San Francisco Giants

481
00:58:53,268 --> 00:58:56,445
just hit his 756th
career home run,

482
00:58:56,576 --> 00:58:59,057
passing Hank Aaron
as the all-time leader

483
00:58:59,187 --> 00:59:00,885
in Major League Baseball.

484
00:59:01,015 --> 00:59:03,278
Bonds hit the home run against
Washington Nationals

485
00:59:03,409 --> 00:59:06,325
pitcher Mike Bassett in
the fifth inning of their game

486
00:59:06,455 --> 00:59:09,807
and AT&T Park
in San Francisco, California.

487
00:59:24,865 --> 00:59:28,826
-Bonds stands alone.

488
00:59:28,956 --> 00:59:30,218
He is on top
of the world tonight.

489
01:00:43,030 --> 01:00:45,598
Bon appétit.

490
01:01:42,307 --> 01:01:46,137
- Welcome. Just for the record.
- Yes.

491
01:01:46,267 --> 01:01:48,269
I never knew
until I read your book...

492
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:51,011
- Yes.
- ...that black swans existed.

493
01:01:51,142 --> 01:01:53,013
I thought all swans were white.

494
01:01:53,144 --> 01:01:56,147
-But my... my black swan
doesn't have feathers.

495
01:01:56,277 --> 01:02:00,151
My black swan is,
number one, a surprise.

496
01:02:00,281 --> 01:02:03,720
Two, it's very consequential.

497
01:02:03,850 --> 01:02:05,330
Extremely consequential.

498
01:02:09,595 --> 01:02:12,554
Think of the first war,
the Great War.

499
01:02:12,685 --> 01:02:14,339
Think of, Google,
the Internet.

500
01:02:14,469 --> 01:02:16,254
The Renaissance,
the invention...

501
01:02:16,384 --> 01:02:18,212
- These were all black swans?
- They were black swans.

502
01:02:18,343 --> 01:02:19,997
-There was nothing to indicate
they were coming?

503
01:02:20,127 --> 01:02:21,912
-Nothing to indicate...
Before.

504
01:02:22,042 --> 01:02:25,742
My book is about what I call
the narrative fallacy is...

505
01:02:25,872 --> 01:02:28,048
Just, you know,
as with the Great War,

506
01:02:28,179 --> 01:02:32,139
and after the fact,
we go and find the causes

507
01:02:32,270 --> 01:02:33,793
and effectively, you know...

508
01:02:36,491 --> 01:02:39,103
We like... we don't like
to accept the fact

509
01:02:39,233 --> 01:02:40,278
that we live in a world...

510
01:02:42,149 --> 01:02:43,803
-Shh!

511
01:02:43,934 --> 01:02:46,240
I'm listening to this.
- ...outside of the path

512
01:02:46,371 --> 01:02:48,503
of our imagination,
we don't want to accept it,

513
01:02:48,634 --> 01:02:50,114
so we concoct,
we invent stories

514
01:02:50,244 --> 01:02:53,030
to convince ourself
that we understand.

515
01:02:53,160 --> 01:02:54,814
-What do you know
that we don't know?

516
01:02:54,945 --> 01:02:56,642
-I don't know. That's...
That's exactly what I write.

517
01:02:56,773 --> 01:02:58,209
-Amen, brother.

518
01:02:58,339 --> 01:03:01,038
-What I'm thinking here
is a very simple...

519
01:03:01,168 --> 01:03:03,040
-There's no mathematical
model you've created?

520
01:03:03,170 --> 01:03:05,912
-Not... Not at all. I'm just
showing weaknesses, alright,

521
01:03:06,043 --> 01:03:09,133
and some inferential
methods and weaknesses

522
01:03:09,263 --> 01:03:10,917
and some disciplines, okay,

523
01:03:11,048 --> 01:03:12,397
by showing
that effectively calculate...

524
01:03:12,527 --> 01:03:14,442
Let me give you a-a...
For example,

525
01:03:14,573 --> 01:03:17,184
there are a lot of disciplines,
okay, economics,

526
01:03:17,315 --> 01:03:20,448
political science in which
the expert is no expert.

527
01:03:20,579 --> 01:03:22,711
And I think that the reason...
- Except in retrospect.

528
01:03:22,842 --> 01:03:24,235
- Sorry?
- Except in retrospect.

529
01:03:24,365 --> 01:03:25,802
-Retrospect. And...
And you can show

530
01:03:25,932 --> 01:03:27,194
that they don't have
more predictive power

531
01:03:27,325 --> 01:03:28,717
than cab drivers.
So what I'm...

532
01:03:28,848 --> 01:03:30,937
Here, I'm showing
that, effectively,

533
01:03:31,068 --> 01:03:32,809
we live in a world
we don't understand.

534
01:03:46,997 --> 01:03:48,346
-Lena.

535
01:03:51,653 --> 01:03:53,873
No, I'm just sitting here...

536
01:03:55,832 --> 01:04:00,662
...drinking a 1990 Pétrus
out of your glass.

537
01:04:05,232 --> 01:04:09,497
The book I consulted suggests
that I opened it too early...

538
01:04:13,893 --> 01:04:15,677
...but, you know, it's...

539
01:04:18,115 --> 01:04:21,292
...no, it's... it's...
It's quaffable.

540
01:04:25,862 --> 01:04:28,081
That's the word, right?

541
01:04:37,525 --> 01:04:39,397
No, I wish you would join me.

542
01:04:56,196 --> 01:04:59,504
-I taste...

543
01:04:59,634 --> 01:05:00,461
tobacco...

544
01:05:03,638 --> 01:05:06,511
-...and chocolate.

545
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:47,291
-I'm letting go now.

546
01:07:51,241 --> 01:07:53,634
- Sir?
- No, hold on.

547
01:08:15,308 --> 01:08:16,788
Yes, Sally?

548
01:08:16,918 --> 01:08:19,182
-Mr. Boca, you have not been
answering your phone.

549
01:08:19,312 --> 01:08:21,358
Mr. Werner
has been trying to reach you.

550
01:08:21,488 --> 01:08:25,753
- You were right, Sally.
- I'm... sick.

551
01:08:25,884 --> 01:08:28,756
Mr. Werner wants to know
if you have finished

552
01:08:28,887 --> 01:08:30,584
updating Honeybee.

553
01:08:30,715 --> 01:08:34,632
-Tell him he can continue
to sleep well at night.

554
01:08:34,762 --> 01:08:36,112
-So that's a yes, then?

555
01:08:36,242 --> 01:08:38,810
Because...

556
01:08:44,207 --> 01:08:46,774
All of the black boxes
are ready.

557
01:08:48,515 --> 01:08:50,561
-Thanks.

558
01:08:59,091 --> 01:09:00,832
-What is going on here?

559
01:09:40,393 --> 01:09:42,874
-Enough.

560
01:10:09,335 --> 01:10:11,859
Hi, Sally.
- Mr. Boca, are you okay?

561
01:10:11,990 --> 01:10:13,731
-No, no, I'm... I'm okay.

562
01:10:13,861 --> 01:10:16,124
I need a box
of citronella candles.

563
01:10:16,255 --> 01:10:18,562
- Okay.
- Now, how many come in a box?

564
01:10:18,692 --> 01:10:21,956
And in a carton?

565
01:10:22,087 --> 01:10:25,395
-Okay, yeah, yeah, no, I'll...
I'll... I'll take a carton.

566
01:10:25,525 --> 01:10:27,310
- Okay.
- And flowers,

567
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:29,268
cut and potted.
- Potted?

568
01:10:29,399 --> 01:10:31,618
Let's just buy out
the whole store.

569
01:10:31,749 --> 01:10:36,188
Fine. Just the white ones.

570
01:10:36,319 --> 01:10:38,277
And when my tux arrives,
just...

571
01:10:38,408 --> 01:10:43,413
Just hang it on the door handle
and ring the buzzer twice.

572
01:10:43,543 --> 01:10:45,415
-Okay. Right away.

573
01:11:04,825 --> 01:11:07,393
-Finally...

574
01:11:07,524 --> 01:11:10,135
some order
and obedience.

575
01:11:54,484 --> 01:11:57,617
Look upon her,
ye young ones.

576
01:11:59,924 --> 01:12:02,492
For all of you
who didn't get to know her,

577
01:12:02,622 --> 01:12:05,233
she was a great mother.

578
01:12:07,845 --> 01:12:10,195
It's because of her
that we are all here.

579
01:12:12,284 --> 01:12:14,721
Look beyond yourselves.

580
01:12:17,550 --> 01:12:20,379
We, too, are an ecosystem.

581
01:12:22,294 --> 01:12:27,343
And if we are going to survive,
we need to work together.

582
01:12:34,698 --> 01:12:38,789
To Mother,
may we all make you proud.

583
01:14:03,787 --> 01:14:06,311
-We'll be making a few stops.

584
01:14:06,442 --> 01:14:09,532
Now, the first is near
the New York Stock Exchange.

585
01:15:23,562 --> 01:15:25,869
-And now to this wine bar.

586
01:16:20,750 --> 01:16:23,274
Excuse me. Abby, right?

587
01:16:23,404 --> 01:16:26,407
-Yes, and may I help you?

588
01:16:26,538 --> 01:16:29,106
-Well,
is Lena working tonight?

589
01:16:29,236 --> 01:16:30,629
-Um, may I tell her
who's here?

590
01:16:30,760 --> 01:16:32,022
Yes, I'm... I'm sorry.

591
01:16:32,152 --> 01:16:34,241
I'm Richard.

592
01:16:34,372 --> 01:16:37,462
Richard Boca.

593
01:16:37,593 --> 01:16:39,246
-Richard.

594
01:16:39,377 --> 01:16:41,161
Yeah, just one second.

595
01:16:45,992 --> 01:16:50,388
Please,
just kindly wait there.

596
01:16:50,518 --> 01:16:52,564
Yeah, just right there, please.

597
01:17:24,552 --> 01:17:27,555
-Richard? Is that you?

598
01:17:27,686 --> 01:17:31,124
- Hi.
- My God, are you okay?

599
01:17:31,255 --> 01:17:33,126
-Never better.

600
01:17:35,781 --> 01:17:38,349
Well, here,
I got you a new one.

601
01:17:43,136 --> 01:17:46,096
What's wrong? Did... Did you
already get another one?

602
01:17:46,226 --> 01:17:48,664
-No.
They're not gloves, Richard.

603
01:17:51,144 --> 01:17:54,408
-Um, you never
called me back.

604
01:17:54,539 --> 01:17:57,542
-I told you, I have class,
and I'm here in the evenings.

605
01:18:02,373 --> 01:18:04,897
Richard...

606
01:18:05,028 --> 01:18:06,986
you can't keep calling.

607
01:18:11,251 --> 01:18:12,426
-I'm sorry.

608
01:18:16,126 --> 01:18:18,519
I didn't know how else to...
To do this.

609
01:18:21,218 --> 01:18:23,524
I don't know
how this works.

610
01:18:26,832 --> 01:18:28,878
-She's adorable.

611
01:18:29,008 --> 01:18:30,880
What am I supposed
to do with her?

612
01:18:36,842 --> 01:18:38,539
-Dickie, my boy.

613
01:18:45,851 --> 01:18:48,898
-I'll get you a glass.

614
01:18:49,028 --> 01:18:51,727
Abby?
- Yeah?

615
01:18:55,774 --> 01:18:59,082
Thank you.

616
01:18:59,212 --> 01:19:03,521
-Glad to see you.
We were worried about you.

617
01:19:18,362 --> 01:19:20,277
-Love the tux.

618
01:19:47,347 --> 01:19:49,306
-I see you've met the new owner.

619
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:53,484
-Can you get us another one,
please?

620
01:19:53,614 --> 01:19:54,877
-Sure.

621
01:19:56,530 --> 01:19:58,881
-Now, we are sitting on
a $10 billion time bomb,

622
01:19:59,011 --> 01:20:03,059
and you're doing what,
buying wine bars?

623
01:20:03,189 --> 01:20:06,192
A little dramatic, no?

624
01:20:06,323 --> 01:20:11,023
So, did you update the model?

625
01:20:11,154 --> 01:20:12,938
-Kind of.

626
01:20:13,069 --> 01:20:18,161
Actually, I-I created
an entirely new one.

627
01:20:18,291 --> 01:20:20,685
-What?

628
01:20:20,816 --> 01:20:23,209
But what was wrong
with Honeybee?

629
01:20:23,340 --> 01:20:24,471
It took years to perfect.

630
01:20:24,602 --> 01:20:26,952
-No. I told you

631
01:20:27,083 --> 01:20:31,652
that the environment
is too hostile and destructive.

632
01:20:31,783 --> 01:20:33,306
I taught it to defend itself.

633
01:20:33,437 --> 01:20:36,309
-How long have you been
working on this?

634
01:20:36,440 --> 01:20:39,225
- Two days.
- Two days and it's live?

635
01:20:39,356 --> 01:20:42,576
-You may not understand
algorithms,

636
01:20:42,707 --> 01:20:44,796
but you're a master
of game theory.

637
01:20:44,927 --> 01:20:49,235
Quite the prisoner's dilemma
you find yourself.

638
01:20:49,366 --> 01:20:53,631
What makes you think
I can be played?

639
01:20:53,761 --> 01:20:55,851
-2005 Scarecrow.

640
01:20:55,981 --> 01:20:57,678
-What's your end game?

641
01:20:57,809 --> 01:20:59,593
You couldn't fuck her,
so you tried to fuck me?

642
01:21:08,602 --> 01:21:10,735
-Don't let him control you.

643
01:21:29,841 --> 01:21:32,452
To these rare occasions.

644
01:21:32,583 --> 01:21:34,454
-May they remain such.

645
01:22:32,556 --> 01:22:34,253
-Come.

646
01:22:43,610 --> 01:22:45,308
Sit.

647
01:23:27,611 --> 01:23:30,614
Before he bought the wine bar,
he helped me out with rent.

648
01:23:32,659 --> 01:23:34,531
That's how it started.

649
01:23:47,892 --> 01:23:51,417
The owner wasn't even
looking to sell.

650
01:23:51,548 --> 01:23:53,724
But when Ed
would want something...

651
01:24:06,693 --> 01:24:08,608
I feel trapped.

652
01:24:14,745 --> 01:24:16,790
-We can do better than this.

653
01:24:30,152 --> 01:24:33,024
- Hey.
- Come here, little guy.

654
01:24:33,155 --> 01:24:37,289
Hey.

655
01:24:37,420 --> 01:24:41,250
Wow!
Were you expecting someone?

656
01:24:43,382 --> 01:24:47,082
What is that scent?

657
01:24:47,212 --> 01:24:50,563
Is that citronella?

658
01:24:50,694 --> 01:24:52,652
You moved it.

659
01:24:52,783 --> 01:24:57,092
See? That's much better.

660
01:24:57,222 --> 01:24:59,746
-I sold everything else.

661
01:24:59,877 --> 01:25:02,184
But I saved this one
just for you.

662
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:16,850
-Ooh. Crown jewel.

663
01:25:16,981 --> 01:25:18,809
-Allow me.

664
01:25:38,785 --> 01:25:43,616
-Should you be drinking?

665
01:25:43,747 --> 01:25:46,315
The sweating.

666
01:25:46,445 --> 01:25:47,794
Is it an allergy?

667
01:25:51,624 --> 01:25:54,410
-It's... It's self-discovery.

668
01:25:56,281 --> 01:25:58,414
One's self-preservation.

669
01:26:08,554 --> 01:26:10,339
-Think you found yourself
a roommate.

670
01:26:18,521 --> 01:26:20,610
-You know, I got a decanter.

671
01:26:22,829 --> 01:26:27,834
But I still only have one glass,
so I have to share.

672
01:26:57,821 --> 01:27:02,260
-Here.

673
01:27:02,391 --> 01:27:04,001
-What do you think?

674
01:27:04,131 --> 01:27:05,481
-You first.

675
01:27:17,884 --> 01:27:19,364
So...

676
01:27:22,062 --> 01:27:24,064
Worms.

677
01:27:24,195 --> 01:27:28,068
Worms?

678
01:27:28,199 --> 01:27:31,333
And truffles.

679
01:27:31,463 --> 01:27:33,204
You know what?

680
01:27:33,335 --> 01:27:34,858
I think you nailed it.

681
01:27:44,433 --> 01:27:48,263
Have you been following
this story?

682
01:27:48,393 --> 01:27:52,354
The miners trapped in Utah.

683
01:27:52,484 --> 01:27:53,746
-No.

684
01:27:55,357 --> 01:27:58,273
But I know
how these stories and.

685
01:27:58,403 --> 01:28:00,536
-What... they'll vanish,
like your bees?

686
01:28:08,152 --> 01:28:09,762
Those poor people.

687
01:28:36,528 --> 01:28:40,619
-There's something
I'd like to show you.

688
01:28:40,750 --> 01:28:42,360
-What is it?

689
01:28:54,111 --> 01:28:56,766
I hope it's not more wine.

690
01:28:56,896 --> 01:28:58,115
-No, no, no.

691
01:28:58,245 --> 01:29:02,467
Um, it is, um...

692
01:29:02,598 --> 01:29:07,646
but only in the way
wine led you to water,

693
01:29:07,777 --> 01:29:10,301
when water led you here.

694
01:29:27,057 --> 01:29:29,668
It's your turn to let go.

695
01:31:55,988 --> 01:31:57,860
-Welcome home.

696
01:32:41,033 --> 01:32:43,775
-We have some breaking news
on the financial markets.

697
01:32:43,906 --> 01:32:46,386
For that, we turn it over
to our resident economist,

698
01:32:46,517 --> 01:32:49,651
Rachel Godoy,
reporting from Wall Street.

699
01:32:49,781 --> 01:32:51,740
-News out of the U.K.
this morning.

700
01:32:51,870 --> 01:32:54,307
BNP Paribas is citing,
and I quote,

701
01:32:54,438 --> 01:32:56,614
a complete evaporation
of liquidity,

702
01:32:56,745 --> 01:32:58,137
and it's blocking withdrawals

703
01:32:58,268 --> 01:32:59,748
from three major hedge funds.

704
01:32:59,878 --> 01:33:01,924
As a result,
the Dow Jones Industrial Average

705
01:33:02,054 --> 01:33:05,231
is down nearly 400 points
