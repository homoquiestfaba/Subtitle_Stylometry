00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:33,759
Yes, sir.

2
00:01:33,761 --> 00:01:35,010
So beautiful.

3
00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:36,427
This is a one in
a million score.

4
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:38,930
Can't believe we
pulled this shit off.

5
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:40,433
Don't get no better than this.

6
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:51,529
This cash and this gold.

7
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:03,789
What's up, man?

8
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:05,373
You're making me nervous,
keep looking at that thing.

9
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:07,250
We're not in the clear yet.

10
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:08,251
What do you mean?

11
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:08,962
We got company.

12
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:15,008
I thought you lost this
nigga back in East Hollywood.

13
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:16,009
I thought so too.

14
00:02:16,011 --> 00:02:17,345
This motherfucker can drive.

15
00:02:22,935 --> 00:02:25,476
Drive or not, he don't

16
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:27,896
Hey, hey, hey, what

00:02:27,898 --> 00:02:28,481
Cheating.

18
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:32,444
Don't hit any potholes.

19
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:34,279
SHIT!

20
00:02:38,742 --> 00:02:39,825

00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:43,872
Tweed, stop!

24
00:02:51,755 --> 00:02:53,505
Shit!

25
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:55,090
Get the fuck in.

26
00:02:55,092 --> 00:02:55,718

27
00:02:58,804 --> 00:02:59,597
Oh, shit.

28
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,565
Tweed, talk to me.

00:03:13,944 --> 00:03:15,529
Get this motherfucker.

37
00:04:18,801 --> 00:04:23,261
You guys would have been good
protein for my dog, homie.

38
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,471
Oh, yeah.

00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:27,933
See your face.

40
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:29,059
Fuck you.

41
00:04:40,155 --> 00:04:41,406
Fucked up.

00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:47,621
You shot a fucking LAPD officer.

43
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:52,835
Go to hell!

44
00:04:59,842 --> 00:05:01,174
This here is the cat.

00:05:01,176 --> 00:05:03,677

00:05:03,679 --> 00:05:06,221
He go zero to 200 with my dawg.

00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:08,682
You can't see inside this
with them windows all tinted.

48
00:05:08,684 --> 00:05:10,016
Pay attention.

49
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:12,644
Pussy niggers listen
when it's mob bidnezz.

50
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:15,983
We get...

51
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:24,740
Bitch.

52
00:05:24,742 --> 00:05:25,490
I'm back in the demon town.

53
00:05:28,621 --> 00:05:29,953
I to do with his laugh.

54
00:05:29,955 --> 00:05:30,996
You must be out of your
mind if you're thinking

55
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:32,247
I'm not going to.

56
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:36,209
You might be one of
your..

57
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:36,960
what are you doing.

58
00:05:36,962 --> 00:05:38,211
You better leave us alone.

59
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:39,588
Fuck, nigga, this is
not what you want.

60
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:40,922
I got to calm down.

61
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:42,257
They're
me up on my lawn now.

62
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:43,800
I fell in love
with a firecracker

63
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:45,010
Bitch on the ball now.

64
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:46,094
I got away with the words.

65
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:47,387
I really play with the word.

66
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:49,347
shut if
you play with the word.

67
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:53,268
I do not hang with rappers.

68
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:55,270
You got a chain
trying to be gang.

69
00:05:58,316 --> 00:06:00,066
These niggers actors,
they're nowhere

70
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:01,484
to be found when
shit get trashy.

71
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:03,612
Play with the game, we
put your name on the wall.

72
00:06:03,614 --> 00:06:04,821
You better get us involved.

73
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:05,864
Bitch, I'll knock you off.

74
00:06:07,159 --> 00:06:09,701
I'm a
playing hard ball.

75
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:12,495
He go zero to 200 with my dawg.

76
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:14,915
You can't see inside this
with them windows all tinted.

77
00:06:14,917 --> 00:06:16,207
Pay attention.

78
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:18,877
Pussy niggers listen
when it's mob bidnezz.

79
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:21,256
We get..

80
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,307
Yeah,

81
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:16,351
I found him.

82
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:17,561
Say again?

83
00:07:17,563 --> 00:07:18,812
I found your son.

84
00:07:18,814 --> 00:07:19,982
Found Vincent.

85
00:07:23,694 --> 00:07:24,610
Wait a minute.

86
00:07:24,612 --> 00:07:25,902
You're serious?

87
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:27,821
It was a pain in the
ass, but I found a.

88
00:07:27,823 --> 00:07:32,408
He's been going by the name of
Victor Stavros for a while now.

89
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:34,410
And where is he?

90
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:36,913
See, that's the
complicated part.

91
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:38,665
Where's my son?

92
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:41,084
Valverde State Prison.

93
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:42,628
He's in prison?

94
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:44,170
He's fine.

95
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:47,298
He's doing a stint for robbery
and a bunch of other shit.

96
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,843
They're trying to pin the death
of an undercover cop named

97
00:07:49,845 --> 00:07:52,470
Ramon Chavez on
him, but it's not

98
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:56,057
sticking, seen as Chavez shot
at Vincent and his driver.

99
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:58,935
Wait a minute, he shot my son?

100
00:07:58,937 --> 00:08:00,854
I said he's fine didn t I?

101
00:08:00,856 --> 00:08:01,897
Ok, wait.

102
00:08:01,899 --> 00:08:02,773
This prison, where is it?

103
00:08:02,775 --> 00:08:03,982
California.

104
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:04,858
Copy that.

105
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:05,944
Check's in the mail.

106
00:08:40,771 --> 00:08:41,354
4A.

107
00:08:57,746 --> 00:08:58,413
To the desk.

108
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:05,796
Personal belongings.

109
00:09:08,674 --> 00:09:09,257
Glasses.

110
00:09:12,219 --> 00:09:14,346
Sign in, first name,
last name, time in.

111
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:21,935
See my colleague?

112
00:09:21,937 --> 00:09:23,186
Face me.

113
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:24,607
Arms out to your side,
feet spread apart.

114
00:09:30,863 --> 00:09:31,446
Turn around.

115
00:09:37,119 --> 00:09:38,910
You guys done?

116
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:40,245
We're done.

117
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:43,039
Thank you, Mr. Smith.

118
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:44,833
What are you, 6' 3"?

119
00:09:44,835 --> 00:09:45,418
6' 5".

120
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:12,903
OK.

121
00:10:12,905 --> 00:10:13,697
Hello, son.

122
00:10:16,659 --> 00:10:19,325
Hi, Alex.

123
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:21,246
Back to using first
names again, right?

124
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:25,456
How'd you find me?

125
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,501
It doesn't matter.

126
00:10:27,503 --> 00:10:29,628
It was Kirk, wasn't it?

127
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:32,088
The fucking narc still
diming people out to you

128
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:33,840
after all these years.

129
00:10:33,842 --> 00:10:34,841
He's a good friend.

130
00:10:34,843 --> 00:10:35,844
He's a fucking tool.

131
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:41,640
What do you want?

132
00:10:41,642 --> 00:10:45,226
I don't need to want anything.

133
00:10:45,228 --> 00:10:45,979
I'm your father.

134
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:49,898
Victor, huh?

135
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:53,819
At least that's what
I said on my fake ID.

136
00:10:53,821 --> 00:10:57,197
Funny thing is it was your
mother's first choice.

137
00:10:57,199 --> 00:10:59,449
Her great grandfather's name.

138
00:10:59,451 --> 00:11:04,162
We ended up tossing a
coin, and Vincent won.

139
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:05,539
Yeah.

140
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:07,165
I know that story.

141
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:09,668
Yeah.

142
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:10,752
Penny.

143
00:11:10,754 --> 00:11:11,587
Yeah?

144
00:11:11,589 --> 00:11:12,756
How are you holding up in here?

145
00:11:26,729 --> 00:11:29,439
bring my
fucking..

146
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,945
I don't know.

147
00:11:36,947 --> 00:11:38,071
I mean--

148
00:11:38,073 --> 00:11:40,574
Kirk mentioned something
about an undercover cop.

149
00:11:40,576 --> 00:11:41,908
What about him?

150
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:44,202
Man, it's me you're
talking to, OK?

151
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:45,495
I'm not an attorney.

152
00:11:45,497 --> 00:11:47,497
And assume I already
know what happened.

153
00:11:47,499 --> 00:11:49,668
I just want to hear
your side of the story.

154
00:11:52,713 --> 00:11:55,338
Buddy and I we, ran
off with some cholo's

155
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:57,175
payload over in East Hollywood.

156
00:12:01,346 --> 00:12:02,804
Security must have
tipped him off

157
00:12:02,806 --> 00:12:05,265
because his muscle caught
up with this pretty fast.

158
00:12:05,267 --> 00:12:06,391
Muscle was undercover.

159
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:08,560
No, he's a fucking cop.

160
00:12:08,562 --> 00:12:09,897
Fuck, he was so dirty.

161
00:12:12,775 --> 00:12:15,400
Did you shoot the
police officer?

162
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:18,361
What if I did?

163
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:20,280
Yeah, it's not
like you don't have

164
00:12:20,282 --> 00:12:22,323
any experience killing people.

165
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:23,534
That was different Vinny.

166
00:12:23,536 --> 00:12:24,576
That was a job.

167
00:12:24,578 --> 00:12:26,494
I had to put food on the table.

168
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:29,748
Same fucking difference.

169
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:32,250
Look, it's been fun, Alex.

170
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:36,296
Just wait.

171
00:12:36,298 --> 00:12:38,507
Make it fucking quick then.

172
00:12:38,509 --> 00:12:39,424
Get the fucking--

173
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:41,384
Who do you think I am?

174
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:43,053
You can I'm a fucking idiot?

175
00:12:43,055 --> 00:12:44,721
You think I'm stupid?

176
00:12:44,723 --> 00:12:48,349
I know I wasn't around
enough for you growing up.

177
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:49,560
I know that.

178
00:12:49,562 --> 00:12:52,062
Come on, try ever.

179
00:12:52,064 --> 00:12:54,606
Well, I'm trying now.

180
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:57,150
I'm trying now, Vinny.

181
00:12:57,152 --> 00:13:01,029
Now you had
fucking

182
00:13:01,031 --> 00:13:05,450
What are you going to do now,
especially now, now that I'm

183
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:06,868
in here in you're out there?

184
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:08,494
Listen, Vinny, how
many times do I

185
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:09,788
have to go through
this with you?

186
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:10,997
I've explained it.

187
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:12,415
I have to tell it
you over and over.

188
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:14,876
Yeah, you can explain
shit every time.

189
00:13:14,878 --> 00:13:18,213
Black Ops, top secret.

190
00:13:18,215 --> 00:13:20,841
So fucking cool.

191
00:13:20,843 --> 00:13:23,009
There comes a time when
you just heard enough.

192
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:24,344
Hey, don't fucking touch me!

193
00:13:24,346 --> 00:13:24,970
Oh!

194
00:13:24,972 --> 00:13:25,345
Fuck!

195
00:13:25,347 --> 00:13:26,179
Oh!

196
00:13:26,181 --> 00:13:26,722
Shit.

197
00:13:26,724 --> 00:13:27,848
Fucking asshole.

198
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:29,560
What the fuck was
paying for, man?

199
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:38,149
Too fucking cool.

200
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:40,485
All I'd ever do
at school is talk

201
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:42,738
about how fucking cool you are.

202
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:45,574
I had my prom date
asking, where's your dad?

203
00:13:45,576 --> 00:13:51,913
But the real kicker is when
your mom is on her deathbed,

204
00:13:51,915 --> 00:13:56,752
and she's begging to see her
husband just one last time.

205
00:13:56,754 --> 00:13:59,713
And all I could
do was lie to her.

206
00:13:59,715 --> 00:14:01,840
That's all I could do.

207
00:14:01,842 --> 00:14:02,924
Tell her, hey, no, no.

208
00:14:02,926 --> 00:14:05,594
He's on-- he's on the way.

209
00:14:05,596 --> 00:14:06,469
He's coming.

210
00:14:06,471 --> 00:14:07,763
He's going to be here.

211
00:14:07,765 --> 00:14:10,056
You just hang on there
a little bit longer.

212
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:12,768
You skip holding her
hand, nice and firm.

213
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:14,561
You know, like what
it means to be there

214
00:14:14,563 --> 00:14:20,277
until finally I just felt her
stop holding my hand back.

215
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:26,698
That should have been you!

216
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,241
Hey, watch it.

217
00:14:28,243 --> 00:14:30,994
Settle down.

218
00:14:30,996 --> 00:14:32,330
That should have been you.

219
00:14:37,294 --> 00:14:47,302
I'm-- I'm sorry, Vinny.

220
00:14:47,304 --> 00:14:48,845
I'm really sorry.

221
00:14:48,847 --> 00:14:51,975
You don't even know what
that word fucking means.

222
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:55,686
Vinny.

223
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:01,817
So what?

224
00:15:01,819 --> 00:15:05,403
You think you can just
get me out of here, hmm?

225
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:06,323
You really think so?

226
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:10,992
There's no such
thing as a guarantee.

227
00:15:10,994 --> 00:15:13,912
I'm not playing these
fucking games anymore.

228
00:15:13,914 --> 00:15:15,288
Come on, Vinny.

229
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:18,667
Why don't you just
fucking leave.

230
00:15:18,669 --> 00:15:20,251
Leave!

231
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:20,838
Leave!

232
00:15:24,758 --> 00:15:27,759
Fuck you.

233
00:15:27,761 --> 00:15:28,510
Fuck you.

234
00:15:51,034 --> 00:15:56,454
Yeah, I can't wait
to get out of here.

235
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:57,581
Let's get this going.

236
00:15:57,583 --> 00:15:59,500
We have 10 more after this one.

237
00:16:04,256 --> 00:16:08,927
Inmate 201693, Maximilian
Ezekiel Chandler.

238
00:16:12,723 --> 00:16:14,349
You certify that this is you?

239
00:16:17,352 --> 00:16:18,270
That's me.

240
00:16:20,856 --> 00:16:22,689
Warden.

241
00:16:22,691 --> 00:16:23,316
Chandler.

242
00:16:27,237 --> 00:16:29,112
How's the stab wound?

243
00:16:29,114 --> 00:16:31,573
Healed up nicely.

244
00:16:31,575 --> 00:16:33,074
How's the taser marks?

245
00:16:35,746 --> 00:16:38,163
Sergeant Baker, nice of
you to join us today.

246
00:16:38,165 --> 00:16:39,956
I wouldn't miss
this for the world.

247
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:42,417
But it's such a beautiful world.

248
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:43,585
It is.

249
00:16:43,587 --> 00:16:47,088
It's be much more beautiful
without you in it.

250
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:48,590
You know, considering
our history,

251
00:16:48,592 --> 00:16:50,926
I thought maybe you might have
something perhaps a little

252
00:16:50,928 --> 00:16:52,928
less cliche to contribute.

253
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:54,596
Can we continue, please?

254
00:16:54,598 --> 00:16:55,847
Yes, of course.

255
00:16:55,849 --> 00:16:56,765
How rude of me.

256
00:16:56,767 --> 00:16:58,600
Please.

257
00:16:58,602 --> 00:17:01,812
You are here to determine if
you're eligible for parole

258
00:17:01,814 --> 00:17:04,272
based on past time served.

259
00:17:04,274 --> 00:17:07,818
You were tried for four separate
terrorist bombings resulting

260
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:08,652
in numerous deaths.

261
00:17:08,654 --> 00:17:09,319
Four.

262
00:17:09,321 --> 00:17:10,612
I told them it was 15.

263
00:17:10,614 --> 00:17:12,906
Well, cops rarely do
their due diligence,

264
00:17:12,908 --> 00:17:14,991
isn't that right, sergeant?

265
00:17:14,993 --> 00:17:17,869
You have been in
four fights resulting

266
00:17:17,871 --> 00:17:19,621
in the deaths of three inmates.

267
00:17:19,623 --> 00:17:22,373
You had your aforementioned
encounter with the warden

268
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:26,044
here and pulled out
another inmate's eyeball

269
00:17:26,046 --> 00:17:28,213
from the socket
while he was alive.

270
00:17:28,215 --> 00:17:30,924
I guess I needed it.

271
00:17:30,926 --> 00:17:34,262
Mr. Chandler, why on earth
would we approve you for parole?

272
00:17:36,932 --> 00:17:38,932
I found Jesus.

273
00:17:38,934 --> 00:17:41,852
Do you think that
erases your crime?

274
00:17:41,854 --> 00:17:43,478
No.

275
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:46,690
Then why do you deserve parole?

276
00:17:46,692 --> 00:17:51,027
Well, because I'm more dangerous
inside than I am outside.

277
00:18:08,922 --> 00:18:10,423
Have you watched
the news lately?

278
00:18:12,635 --> 00:18:14,467
The world is reaching
a boiling point.

279
00:18:14,469 --> 00:18:17,303
And keeping revolutionaries
such as myself locked up just

280
00:18:17,305 --> 00:18:20,056
turns up the heat.

281
00:18:20,058 --> 00:18:21,517
You know, I never
expected my art

282
00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:24,394
to be so broadly
accepted by small minds.

283
00:18:24,396 --> 00:18:28,732
So I forgive you for that.

284
00:18:28,734 --> 00:18:30,483
OH.

285
00:18:30,485 --> 00:18:33,820
OK, I think that's enough.

286
00:18:33,822 --> 00:18:35,864
I vote his ass stays here.

287
00:18:35,866 --> 00:18:36,907
Second.

288
00:18:36,909 --> 00:18:37,908
Unanimous.

289
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:40,493
He stays here.

290
00:18:40,495 --> 00:18:42,495
Any parting words, Mr. Chandler?

291
00:18:42,497 --> 00:18:43,204
Yes.

292
00:18:43,206 --> 00:18:45,999
Do you have the time?

293
00:18:46,001 --> 00:18:47,250
It's 12:57.

294
00:18:47,252 --> 00:18:48,459
You're going to be
late to lunch if you

295
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:50,504
don't make this one quick.

296
00:18:50,506 --> 00:18:52,380
Looks like we still
have a few minutes then.

297
00:18:52,382 --> 00:18:53,882
A few minutes before what?

298
00:18:53,884 --> 00:18:55,175
Don't listen to this shit.

299
00:18:55,177 --> 00:18:56,217
Stop.

300
00:18:56,219 --> 00:18:58,681
I'm not done talking.

301
00:18:59,682 --> 00:19:00,641
You know, Sergeant.

302
00:19:02,059 --> 00:19:04,184
I'm truly sorry.

303
00:19:04,186 --> 00:19:07,521
I'm sorry that you spent a
decade of your life tracking

304
00:19:07,523 --> 00:19:08,564
me down.

305
00:19:08,566 --> 00:19:10,649
I am sorry that
your wife left you

306
00:19:10,651 --> 00:19:12,067
and your kids don't
want to see you.

307
00:19:12,069 --> 00:19:15,236
And I'm sorry you're such
a shitty cop that not even

308
00:19:15,238 --> 00:19:16,822
drinking helps you
sleep at night.

309
00:19:16,824 --> 00:19:17,823
Ouch, Max.

310
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:34,297
And you, I'm sorry you do
such a horrible job running

311
00:19:34,299 --> 00:19:37,092
this place-- should be torn
down and turned into a shopping

312
00:19:37,094 --> 00:19:38,426
mall.

313
00:19:38,428 --> 00:19:39,720
And I'm truly sorry I
stabbed you in the neck.

314
00:19:39,722 --> 00:19:41,513
What are you wasting
our time for, Chandler?

315
00:19:41,515 --> 00:19:44,265
Who says I'm wasting
anyone's time?

316
00:19:56,655 --> 00:20:00,156
I almost forgot your
partner, Williams.

317
00:20:00,158 --> 00:20:03,159
Is he still eating all
his meals through a tube?

318
00:20:05,372 --> 00:20:06,955
What's the time?

319
00:20:06,957 --> 00:20:09,500
The time?

320
00:20:09,502 --> 00:20:10,416
It's 1:00.

321
00:20:44,161 --> 00:20:48,079
I'm done with them.

322
00:20:48,081 --> 00:20:49,039
Don't.

323
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:49,414
No!

324
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:50,040
No!

325
00:20:50,042 --> 00:20:50,582
No!

326
00:21:15,901 --> 00:21:17,901
Those ain't earthquakes, is it?

327
00:21:17,903 --> 00:21:18,610
Nah.

328
00:21:18,612 --> 00:21:19,485
That was no earthquake.

329
00:21:19,487 --> 00:21:20,987
I can't override it.

330
00:21:20,989 --> 00:21:21,655
This is bad.

331
00:21:21,657 --> 00:21:22,823
I'm going out.

332
00:21:22,825 --> 00:21:24,950
Copy you on your six.

333
00:21:24,952 --> 00:21:27,202
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

334
00:21:27,204 --> 00:21:28,369
I'm the next shift.

335
00:21:37,506 --> 00:21:39,673
Max, you copy?

336
00:21:39,675 --> 00:21:40,966
I hear you, Luke.

337
00:21:40,968 --> 00:21:42,383
Well done.

338
00:21:42,385 --> 00:21:43,802
That's what I do.

339
00:21:43,804 --> 00:21:45,554
Time for phase two.

340
00:21:45,556 --> 00:21:48,348
Test, test.

341
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:48,976
Test, test.

342
00:21:54,481 --> 00:21:57,524
Good afternoon,
my fellow inmates.

343
00:21:57,526 --> 00:21:58,567
Max Chandler speaking.

344
00:22:00,403 --> 00:22:04,280
I'm here to inform me that I am
now in control of Mount Vernon

345
00:22:04,282 --> 00:22:04,906
prison.

346
00:22:04,908 --> 00:22:06,241
Ah!

347
00:22:06,243 --> 00:22:09,202
And I'm here to offer you
a chance to get freedom.

348
00:22:09,204 --> 00:22:12,205
You can either choose to
stay here under my command

349
00:22:12,207 --> 00:22:18,336
until our demands are met,
or you are free to go.

350
00:22:18,338 --> 00:22:21,006
My men will not stop you.

351
00:22:21,008 --> 00:22:23,675
There is no punishment for
taking your freedom back.

352
00:22:23,677 --> 00:22:28,263
So go, fly, be free.

353
00:22:28,265 --> 00:22:30,766
And if you choose to
stay here, my demand

354
00:22:30,768 --> 00:22:33,103
will now be your demands.

355
00:22:35,438 --> 00:22:38,857
And for those of you who are
either here visiting loved ones

356
00:22:38,859 --> 00:22:42,694
or working here
for minimum wage,

357
00:22:42,696 --> 00:22:45,196
my men are coming
for your phones,

358
00:22:45,198 --> 00:22:47,365
and to escort you
to the cafeteria

359
00:22:47,367 --> 00:22:50,453
where you will be held under
gunpoint till this is over.

360
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:57,501
And if any of you try
to play hero tonight,

361
00:22:57,503 --> 00:23:00,504
you will be executed
immediately.

362
00:23:03,842 --> 00:23:05,466
Aye, this fool series?

363
00:23:05,468 --> 00:23:06,593
Guess we'll fucking see.

364
00:23:06,595 --> 00:23:08,094
That's Max Chandler, man.

365
00:23:08,096 --> 00:23:11,557
Can't follow this
crazy son of a bitch.

366
00:23:11,559 --> 00:23:13,183
Man, I don't know about this.

367
00:23:18,524 --> 00:23:20,358
It's like music, isn't it?

368
00:23:28,867 --> 00:23:29,868
I need a phone.

369
00:23:40,212 --> 00:23:43,088
Local news.

370
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:47,425
Associated Foreign Press, FBI.

371
00:23:49,387 --> 00:23:50,596
Whom am I forgetting?

372
00:23:50,598 --> 00:23:52,138
What are you doing?

373
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:54,101
Making our demands known.

374
00:23:58,396 --> 00:23:59,938
invitation.

375
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:02,273
You film me.

376
00:24:02,275 --> 00:24:02,816
Come here.

377
00:24:02,818 --> 00:24:04,400
Get my best.

378
00:24:09,908 --> 00:24:10,824
OK.

379
00:24:10,826 --> 00:24:11,409
Ready.

380
00:24:15,748 --> 00:24:18,957
Max Chandler here.

381
00:24:18,959 --> 00:24:20,876
For those of you
that don't know me,

382
00:24:20,878 --> 00:24:25,296
I am currently incarcerated in
Val Verde State Penitentiary

383
00:24:25,298 --> 00:24:29,510
in California for planting
and detonating bombs

384
00:24:29,512 --> 00:24:33,847
in churches and government
buildings 12 years ago.

385
00:24:33,849 --> 00:24:36,474
I'm here to tell you that I
am now in control of Val Verde

386
00:24:36,476 --> 00:24:39,686
prison, and I would like for you
to hear the warden's thoughts

387
00:24:39,688 --> 00:24:41,104
on this.

388
00:24:41,106 --> 00:24:50,572
But he's coming off long
shift, and he's dead tired.

389
00:24:50,574 --> 00:24:55,035
I'll have that I've granted the
other prisoners their freedom.

390
00:24:55,037 --> 00:24:56,578
Good luck in finding them.

391
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:59,665
And I can assure you that if
my forthcoming demands are not

392
00:24:59,667 --> 00:25:02,543
met, then I will destroy
the rest of this prison

393
00:25:02,545 --> 00:25:05,211
with all the hostages
remaining inside.

394
00:25:05,213 --> 00:25:07,839
And my demands are simple.

395
00:25:07,841 --> 00:25:11,677
Release the six remaining
members of the Trier crime

396
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:14,721
family and provide an
escort to a country

397
00:25:14,723 --> 00:25:18,600
that has no extradition
to the United States.

398
00:25:18,602 --> 00:25:21,311
Once I receive word
of their safety

399
00:25:21,313 --> 00:25:23,897
in a helicopter
of my own, I will

400
00:25:23,899 --> 00:25:28,985
release my control of Val Verde
and defuse any remaining bombs

401
00:25:28,987 --> 00:25:32,656
that remain on the grounds.

402
00:25:32,658 --> 00:25:33,826
You have six hours.

403
00:25:48,674 --> 00:25:51,717
Hey, what the hell
happened in here?

404
00:25:51,719 --> 00:25:52,718
What's going on?

405
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,637
What are you doing in here?

406
00:25:56,932 --> 00:25:57,516
Smith?

407
00:26:03,897 --> 00:26:05,021
Yeah, that's right.

408
00:26:05,023 --> 00:26:06,064
Why the fuck are
you still in here?

409
00:26:06,066 --> 00:26:06,982
We evacuated the building.

410
00:26:06,984 --> 00:26:08,358
Hey, man, take it easy.

411
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,318
I was in the bathroom when
the explosion went off.

412
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,445
Hurt my shoulder
pretty fucking bad.

413
00:26:12,447 --> 00:26:14,197
I didn't hear no
evacuation notice.

414
00:26:14,199 --> 00:26:15,824
Probably because
you were unconscious

415
00:26:15,826 --> 00:26:16,783
from the explosions.

416
00:26:16,785 --> 00:26:18,409
I wasn't unconscious.

417
00:26:18,411 --> 00:26:20,746
Who was that on the intercom?

418
00:26:20,748 --> 00:26:22,080
One of the prisoners.

419
00:26:22,082 --> 00:26:23,874
He's responsible for
all the explosions.

420
00:26:23,876 --> 00:26:24,750
No shit.

421
00:26:24,752 --> 00:26:25,667
Yeah.

422
00:26:25,669 --> 00:26:26,752
Yeah, no shit.

423
00:26:26,754 --> 00:26:27,794
OK.

424
00:26:27,796 --> 00:26:29,045
Well, look, I need
to get out of here.

425
00:26:29,047 --> 00:26:30,296
I got to get to the hospital.

426
00:26:30,298 --> 00:26:31,923
I hurt my shoulder
pretty fucking bad, man.

427
00:26:31,925 --> 00:26:34,217
Which is the way out?

428
00:26:34,219 --> 00:26:35,176
Just follow me.

429
00:26:35,178 --> 00:26:35,927
This way?

430
00:26:35,929 --> 00:26:36,639
Yeah, this way.

431
00:26:41,101 --> 00:26:44,269
So Smith, you've got family
that work in the building?

432
00:26:44,271 --> 00:26:45,687
Why do you ask?

433
00:26:45,689 --> 00:26:47,022
Just the two guys that
checked me in this morning,

434
00:26:47,024 --> 00:26:48,273
they were called Smith as well.

435
00:26:48,275 --> 00:26:52,360
It's a pretty common last name.

436
00:26:52,362 --> 00:26:54,487
I used to hate it
when I was a kid.

437
00:26:54,489 --> 00:26:55,030
Fuck!

438
00:27:19,056 --> 00:27:22,348
Now we heard shots.

439
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:24,851
Smith, status.

440
00:27:24,853 --> 00:27:27,437
Yeah, there was a straggler,
but I took care of everything.

441
00:27:27,439 --> 00:27:29,898
Everything's under control.

442
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:31,024
Good.

443
00:27:31,026 --> 00:27:31,985
Hey, don't fuck
around next time.

444
00:27:34,404 --> 00:27:35,153
Understood.

445
00:28:16,947 --> 00:28:19,489
I didn't expect to see you
here so soon after the incident

446
00:28:19,491 --> 00:28:20,240
downtown.

447
00:28:20,242 --> 00:28:20,991
Me neither.

448
00:28:20,993 --> 00:28:22,450
So what we got?

449
00:28:22,452 --> 00:28:23,409
You went briefed?

450
00:28:23,411 --> 00:28:24,745
I think, I'm refreshed.

451
00:28:24,747 --> 00:28:25,746
Get my out
yeah?

452
00:28:25,748 --> 00:28:26,872
Yeah.

453
00:28:26,874 --> 00:28:28,499
Well, we got explosions
on the east south wings

454
00:28:28,501 --> 00:28:29,708
of the facility.

455
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:30,959
Got the blast covered
for now, but not

456
00:28:30,961 --> 00:28:32,503
before a few of the
prisoners escaped.

457
00:28:32,505 --> 00:28:33,336
How many?

458
00:28:33,338 --> 00:28:34,796
Handful.

459
00:28:34,798 --> 00:28:36,381
Enough to keep the department
and Highway Patrol busy.

460
00:28:36,383 --> 00:28:39,050
Got a few arrests already, and
I'm sure more coming in soon.

461
00:28:39,052 --> 00:28:40,802
Who's responsible, huh?

462
00:28:40,804 --> 00:28:43,390
Former LAPD bomb
squad Max Chandler.

463
00:28:47,185 --> 00:28:47,811
Luke!

464
00:28:50,188 --> 00:28:51,938
Always good to see
you, my friend.

465
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:53,189
How's the family?

466
00:28:53,191 --> 00:28:54,691
As well as could be expected.

467
00:28:54,693 --> 00:28:57,235
Hmm, what do we have here?

468
00:28:57,237 --> 00:29:00,071
New recruits.

469
00:29:00,073 --> 00:29:00,741
New recruits.

470
00:29:03,076 --> 00:29:05,493
So you chose me over
freedom, is that right?

471
00:29:05,495 --> 00:29:07,538
Yes, sir.

472
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:08,707
Oh, boy.

473
00:29:11,752 --> 00:29:12,501
What's your name?

474
00:29:12,503 --> 00:29:15,045
Rico Walker.

475
00:29:15,047 --> 00:29:17,088
I'll do anything
you ask me to do.

476
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:18,089
Hmm.

477
00:29:18,091 --> 00:29:19,051
Anything, huh?

478
00:29:22,429 --> 00:29:25,013
Yeah.

479
00:29:25,015 --> 00:29:25,599
Mm.

480
00:29:45,869 --> 00:29:47,786
What the fuck, Chandler?

481
00:29:47,788 --> 00:29:51,665
Any more kiss-asses?

482
00:29:51,667 --> 00:29:53,667
Never trust the first
motherfucker to speak up,

483
00:29:53,669 --> 00:29:54,837
you understand me?

484
00:29:58,924 --> 00:30:00,674
Apparently, there's
an armory in here

485
00:30:00,676 --> 00:30:02,593
to prevent this sort of
thing from happening.

486
00:30:02,595 --> 00:30:06,471
Does anybody happen
to know where it is?

487
00:30:06,473 --> 00:30:07,265
Anybody?

488
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:16,189
You do.

489
00:30:16,191 --> 00:30:18,024
What's your name?

490
00:30:18,026 --> 00:30:18,611
Vincent.

491
00:30:20,988 --> 00:30:22,904
Yeah, maybe if you
don't kill anyone else,

492
00:30:22,906 --> 00:30:24,364
I could lead us all to it.

493
00:30:24,366 --> 00:30:27,743
Hmm, interesting.

494
00:30:27,745 --> 00:30:30,411
Well it looks like
our new friend here

495
00:30:30,413 --> 00:30:32,748
will escort you to the armory.

496
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:36,378
So if you're not
armed, get armed.

497
00:30:41,592 --> 00:30:44,009
Follow me.

498
00:30:44,011 --> 00:30:46,553
Can one of the
Smiths get up here

499
00:30:46,555 --> 00:30:48,429
and pick up three dead bodies?

500
00:30:48,431 --> 00:30:49,057
Copy.

501
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:52,726
Nice.

502
00:31:13,415 --> 00:31:14,330
Oh, my kids do that.

503
00:31:14,332 --> 00:31:14,790
Sure.

504
00:31:17,294 --> 00:31:19,920
Hey, this is Officer
Chaz Coleman.

505
00:31:19,922 --> 00:31:22,172
Now, it's my understanding
that the man who set off

506
00:31:22,174 --> 00:31:24,508
the explosives in
your prison has also

507
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:26,510
said that you could go free.

508
00:31:26,512 --> 00:31:28,303
He's full of shit.

509
00:31:28,305 --> 00:31:31,723
Any inmate who was apprehended
off of prison grounds

510
00:31:31,725 --> 00:31:34,851
will face severe repercussions.

511
00:31:34,853 --> 00:31:36,687
Now I understand--

512
00:31:36,689 --> 00:31:39,314
I understand what
your demands are.

513
00:31:39,316 --> 00:31:42,483
But please know that this
is going to take some time.

514
00:31:42,485 --> 00:31:45,946
We can't just set prisoners
free, do you understand me?

515
00:32:02,923 --> 00:32:04,466
Welcome to the
party, Mr. Coleman.

516
00:32:06,969 --> 00:32:08,760
That was one of
the prison doctors.

517
00:32:08,762 --> 00:32:10,472
It's a bullet to the
back of his head.

518
00:32:13,391 --> 00:32:17,936
Does that give you an idea
the speed I need you working?

519
00:32:17,938 --> 00:32:19,730
That definitely does.

520
00:32:19,732 --> 00:32:20,606
That definitely does.

521
00:32:20,608 --> 00:32:21,233
Thank you.

522
00:32:25,362 --> 00:32:25,986
Thank you.

523
00:32:26,905 --> 00:32:27,489
Get it.

524
00:32:31,869 --> 00:32:32,868
Yeah.

525
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:34,620
Yeah, I got him right here.

526
00:32:34,622 --> 00:32:35,328
It's for you.

527
00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:35,996
What?

528
00:32:35,998 --> 00:32:36,830
Somebody on the inside.

529
00:32:36,832 --> 00:32:37,748
Hostage?

530
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:38,499
I don't think so.

531
00:32:38,501 --> 00:32:39,500
OK.

532
00:32:39,502 --> 00:32:40,626
Can you anyone one
to crack on this?

533
00:32:40,628 --> 00:32:41,376
Yeah.

534
00:32:41,378 --> 00:32:41,545
Yeah, I'm on it.

535
00:32:44,923 --> 00:32:46,047
This is Coleman.

536
00:32:46,049 --> 00:32:48,424
Don't give him what he wants.

537
00:32:48,426 --> 00:32:49,467
I'm sorry?

538
00:32:49,469 --> 00:32:51,011
Who am I speaking to?

539
00:32:51,013 --> 00:32:52,137
Don't worry about who I am.

540
00:32:52,139 --> 00:32:54,014
Just know you got
a friend inside.

541
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:55,807
Well, maybe you don't
want to be my friend, huh?

542
00:32:55,809 --> 00:32:58,351
You want to send you a picture
of the man I just killed?

543
00:32:58,353 --> 00:32:59,520
Maybe some other time, you know.

544
00:32:59,522 --> 00:33:00,436
I'll have to take
your word for it.

545
00:33:01,774 --> 00:33:03,481
The man I just killed was
wearing a corrections officer

546
00:33:03,483 --> 00:33:04,733
uniform.

547
00:33:04,735 --> 00:33:07,944
they supposedly moved the
hostages to the cafeteria.

548
00:33:07,946 --> 00:33:11,322
I've yet to see a
single one of them.

549
00:33:11,324 --> 00:33:14,409
I'm afraid some of them
may have been killed.

550
00:33:14,411 --> 00:33:15,410
Who are you?

551
00:33:15,412 --> 00:33:18,038
An employee?

552
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:20,832
I'm the janitor.

553
00:33:20,834 --> 00:33:22,125
Taking applications?

554
00:33:23,504 --> 00:33:24,753
Bad joke, huh?

555
00:33:24,755 --> 00:33:25,587
Did you get it?

556
00:33:25,589 --> 00:33:26,296
We're working on it.

557
00:33:26,298 --> 00:33:28,423
All right, we'll get it.

558
00:33:28,425 --> 00:33:30,592
Son of a bitch.

559
00:33:30,594 --> 00:33:33,595
So I'd kicked that dirty
hippie out of my house.

560
00:33:33,597 --> 00:33:35,514
That's your place.

561
00:33:35,516 --> 00:33:38,559
so
my girlfriend asked me,

562
00:33:38,561 --> 00:33:40,811
so are you fucking
somebody behind my back?

563
00:33:40,813 --> 00:33:41,645
Yeah.

564
00:33:41,647 --> 00:33:42,437
What did you say?

565
00:33:42,439 --> 00:33:43,271
I said, yeah.

566
00:33:43,273 --> 00:33:45,273
Who the fuck you think it is?

567
00:33:45,275 --> 00:33:45,816
Right?

568
00:33:45,818 --> 00:33:46,441
Right?

569
00:33:47,444 --> 00:33:47,943
Dumb bitch.

570
00:33:49,237 --> 00:33:50,737
Hey,

571
00:33:50,739 --> 00:33:51,780
Got to take a piss.

572
00:33:51,782 --> 00:33:52,823
You're going to be OK out here?

573
00:33:52,825 --> 00:33:54,199
Hurry up, man.

574
00:33:54,201 --> 00:33:56,492
flashbacks
about the prison showers?

575
00:33:56,494 --> 00:33:57,493
That obvious?

576
00:33:57,495 --> 00:33:58,829
Without you saying something.

577
00:33:58,831 --> 00:34:00,330
Hurry the fuck up, man.

578
00:34:00,332 --> 00:34:01,331
Hold up, hold up.

579
00:34:01,333 --> 00:34:03,083
I'll be right out.

580
00:34:03,085 --> 00:34:04,127
Keep it together.

581
00:34:11,552 --> 00:34:13,343
Come on, man.

582
00:34:13,345 --> 00:34:15,303
Hurry the fuck up.

583
00:34:15,305 --> 00:34:16,888
You need to hold
your horses, kid.

584
00:34:16,890 --> 00:34:20,517
It takes me a full minute and
a half to get this behemoth out

585
00:34:20,519 --> 00:34:21,643
of my pants.

586
00:34:21,645 --> 00:34:23,854
Something you'd
have no idea about.

587
00:34:32,990 --> 00:34:35,907
Look, kid, I don't want you
to get all bent out of shape

588
00:34:35,909 --> 00:34:37,494
about what I said
about your mom.

589
00:34:41,832 --> 00:34:43,039
I was just joking about that.

590
00:34:43,041 --> 00:34:43,917
Wasn't being honest.

591
00:34:49,798 --> 00:34:51,214
What the fuck?

592
00:35:02,019 --> 00:35:03,059
What's your name, kid?

593
00:35:03,061 --> 00:35:03,769
Freddie.

594
00:35:03,771 --> 00:35:04,561
OK, Freddie.

595
00:35:04,563 --> 00:35:05,353
Listen to me very carefully.

596
00:35:05,355 --> 00:35:06,732
Get out of here.

597
00:35:15,866 --> 00:35:18,659
Jackpot, motherfuckers.

598
00:35:18,661 --> 00:35:19,660
Oh.

599
00:35:19,662 --> 00:35:21,119
Now, we're going to
fuck some shit up.

600
00:35:21,121 --> 00:35:21,953
Woo!

601
00:35:21,955 --> 00:35:24,289
Check the shotgun.

602
00:35:24,291 --> 00:35:25,333
You take a shotgun.

603
00:35:29,212 --> 00:35:31,713
You got a gun.

604
00:35:31,715 --> 00:35:33,339
No.

605
00:35:33,341 --> 00:35:34,340
Just keeping an eye out.

606
00:35:34,342 --> 00:35:35,425
If y'all lead, I'll follow.

607
00:35:35,427 --> 00:35:36,467
All right, bro.

608
00:35:36,469 --> 00:35:37,761
fucking.

609
00:35:37,763 --> 00:35:39,765
Just making sure no one
gets the jump on us.

610
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:51,399
You see someone out there,
you're going to need that.

611
00:35:51,401 --> 00:35:54,152
Thanks but no thanks.

612
00:35:54,154 --> 00:35:57,989
Is there a problem?

613
00:35:57,991 --> 00:35:59,575
No.

614
00:35:59,577 --> 00:36:01,326
Just last time I
used one of these

615
00:36:01,328 --> 00:36:04,746
is the reason I
ended up in here.

616
00:36:04,748 --> 00:36:07,585
Well, now it's your ticket out.

617
00:36:11,088 --> 00:36:12,754
Yeah, fuck it.

618
00:36:12,756 --> 00:36:13,716
Kill this, man.

619
00:36:18,679 --> 00:36:20,929
So what are you going
to do with your split?

620
00:36:20,931 --> 00:36:24,349
Man, I'm gong to work
through with this.

621
00:36:24,351 --> 00:36:26,101
I don't know about
you, but I can sure

622
00:36:26,103 --> 00:36:28,478
go for some good floor steak.

623
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,188
The hell's a floor steak?

624
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:31,481
Come on, man.

625
00:36:31,483 --> 00:36:34,526
That good pussy, that
meat between the sheets.

626
00:36:34,528 --> 00:36:37,445
Ankles up, always ready.

627
00:36:48,834 --> 00:36:49,710
Motherfucker!

628
00:37:01,805 --> 00:37:06,349
Telling you, he's not
going to go for that.

629
00:37:06,351 --> 00:37:07,392
Yeah?

630
00:37:07,394 --> 00:37:08,519
When the last time someone did?

631
00:37:08,521 --> 00:37:09,520
If you can tell
me that, then I'll

632
00:37:09,522 --> 00:37:10,937
gladly go along with this shit.

633
00:37:10,939 --> 00:37:13,649
But until then, stop
pulling this shit on me, OK?

634
00:37:13,651 --> 00:37:15,191
I'm a 30-year man.

635
00:37:15,193 --> 00:37:28,914
I've been doing this shit before
you were watching Nick Jr.

636
00:37:28,916 --> 00:37:29,998
No luck?

637
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,208
I don't think they
realize they're

638
00:37:32,210 --> 00:37:35,712
going to be responsible for
the deaths of an unknown number

639
00:37:35,714 --> 00:37:38,590
of civilians if they think
that playing by the book

640
00:37:38,592 --> 00:37:39,966
is the best option.

641
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:43,053
Going by the book doesn't
defuse these situations.

642
00:37:43,055 --> 00:37:43,762
Gut instinct does.

643
00:37:43,764 --> 00:37:45,263
Only gut instinct does.

644
00:37:45,265 --> 00:37:46,264
Yeah, I hear that.

645
00:37:46,266 --> 00:37:46,892
Right.

646
00:37:51,396 --> 00:37:52,147
I need an update.

647
00:37:57,903 --> 00:37:59,570
Jenner, hey.

648
00:37:59,572 --> 00:38:01,112
Nothing yet.

649
00:38:01,114 --> 00:38:04,490
Nothing yet, but I need
a little bit more time.

650
00:38:09,331 --> 00:38:13,291
That's another hostage death
because of your negligence.

651
00:38:13,293 --> 00:38:17,337
I hope that helps you
take me more seriously.

652
00:38:17,339 --> 00:38:18,547
It certainly does.

653
00:38:18,549 --> 00:38:20,507
And my transportation?

654
00:38:20,509 --> 00:38:22,008
En route.

655
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:24,636
Military escort?

656
00:38:24,638 --> 00:38:25,512
Working on it.

657
00:38:25,514 --> 00:38:28,139
In progress.

658
00:38:51,081 --> 00:38:51,913
Woo!

659
00:38:51,915 --> 00:38:54,165
It's our prison now, bitches!

660
00:38:54,167 --> 00:38:55,375
Our prison now!

661
00:38:55,377 --> 00:38:56,334
Woo!

662
00:38:56,336 --> 00:38:57,418
Is that you little, bitch?

663
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:58,378
Fuck you!

664
00:38:58,380 --> 00:38:59,588
motherfuckers.

665
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:00,964
Take a ball out of
China or some shit?

666
00:39:00,966 --> 00:39:04,134
Let's fucking do this shit, man.

667
00:39:09,767 --> 00:39:11,349
Fuck you.

668
00:39:11,351 --> 00:39:12,768
motherfucker.

669
00:39:12,770 --> 00:39:14,102
Come on, where you going, man?

670
00:39:14,104 --> 00:39:16,187
Vincent, where you
fucking going to the gym?

671
00:39:16,189 --> 00:39:17,773
Chase, you guys
clear the hallways.

672
00:39:17,775 --> 00:39:19,190
I'll meet you on the West Wing.

673
00:39:19,192 --> 00:39:19,941
Come on.

674
00:39:19,943 --> 00:39:23,111
Let's have some fun boys.

675
00:39:23,113 --> 00:39:24,154
Woo!

676
00:39:24,156 --> 00:39:25,405
We got to make it
to cell block six,

677
00:39:25,407 --> 00:39:26,447
you know what I'm talking about?

678
00:39:26,449 --> 00:39:27,616
Yeah!

679
00:39:27,618 --> 00:39:28,742
you hear
me motherfucker.

680
00:39:28,744 --> 00:39:29,785
What you doing so
far ahead of me?

681
00:39:29,787 --> 00:39:30,952
Don t fucking call me... (indist

682
00:39:30,954 --> 00:39:32,412
Fuck you doing, man?

683
00:39:32,414 --> 00:39:33,496
Let's have some fun!

684
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:40,128
Hey, what the fuck was that?

685
00:40:03,486 --> 00:40:07,531
Get the fuck down the hallway.

686
00:40:22,631 --> 00:40:35,517
The fuck is going
on,

687
00:40:35,519 --> 00:40:36,267
Oh!

688
00:41:06,341 --> 00:41:07,050
New recruits?

689
00:41:12,598 --> 00:41:15,682
Where are the bodies?

690
00:41:15,684 --> 00:41:17,559
Bodies?

691
00:41:17,561 --> 00:41:18,977
The bodies.

692
00:41:18,979 --> 00:41:22,397
You told the negotiator
you're executing hostages.

693
00:41:22,399 --> 00:41:22,981
I did.

694
00:41:22,983 --> 00:41:24,525
You're right.

695
00:41:24,527 --> 00:41:27,528
But I guess you're not.

696
00:41:27,530 --> 00:41:32,699
Ruke, would you take the
men out and do the rounds?

697
00:41:32,701 --> 00:41:33,909
Copy that.

698
00:41:34,662 --> 00:41:35,245
Come on.

699
00:41:40,125 --> 00:41:41,084
Let me see.

700
00:41:46,339 --> 00:41:52,928
You see these people
are willfully ignorant.

701
00:41:52,930 --> 00:41:59,142
They don't understand how things
play out in the real world.

702
00:41:59,144 --> 00:41:59,770
What people?

703
00:42:02,272 --> 00:42:04,149
Those that are not enlightened.

704
00:42:06,610 --> 00:42:10,946
Did you know 90% of
humanity won't cry for help

705
00:42:10,948 --> 00:42:13,532
until the ship is sinking?

706
00:42:13,534 --> 00:42:16,535
They're like pigs
to the slaughter.

707
00:42:16,537 --> 00:42:19,329
As long as it means their
bubbles of self-delusion

708
00:42:19,331 --> 00:42:21,832
aren't
they can die peacefully

709
00:42:21,834 --> 00:42:24,960
believing whatever bullshit
they spent their entire lives

710
00:42:24,962 --> 00:42:27,003
filling their heads with.

711
00:42:27,005 --> 00:42:29,422
So what's your point?

712
00:42:29,424 --> 00:42:30,882
Point?

713
00:42:30,884 --> 00:42:33,343
Yeah, is there a greater point?

714
00:42:33,345 --> 00:42:36,179
A method to your madness?

715
00:42:36,181 --> 00:42:40,016
You know, I used to
be a cop, bomb squad.

716
00:42:40,018 --> 00:42:41,351
No.

717
00:42:41,353 --> 00:42:44,270
You know, I'm in here
for blowing up churches

718
00:42:44,272 --> 00:42:45,355
and government buildings.

719
00:42:45,357 --> 00:42:47,983
Why would I do that?

720
00:42:47,985 --> 00:42:49,985
To make a statement?

721
00:42:49,987 --> 00:42:51,236
To make a statement.

722
00:42:51,238 --> 00:42:54,573
You are smarter than
I thought you were.

723
00:42:54,575 --> 00:42:56,324
I was tired of seeing
all the bullshit

724
00:42:56,326 --> 00:42:57,993
and I knew I had
to do something.

725
00:42:57,995 --> 00:42:59,452
Did you kill innocent people?

726
00:42:59,454 --> 00:43:03,915
Hmm, see, my
definition of innocence

727
00:43:03,917 --> 00:43:06,627
is different than others.

728
00:43:06,629 --> 00:43:09,590
And do you know why they can
only get me with four charges?

729
00:43:13,677 --> 00:43:14,760
You got me?

730
00:43:14,762 --> 00:43:18,054
Because I was told I
almost had a hung jury.

731
00:43:18,056 --> 00:43:21,099
You see, my lawyer had a way
of convincing the jurors to see

732
00:43:21,101 --> 00:43:24,435
my side of the argument.

733
00:43:24,437 --> 00:43:28,398
You see, people need to
get punished so I took away

734
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:29,733
their meaning of life.

735
00:43:29,735 --> 00:43:32,360
Their churches, their
financial institutions,

736
00:43:32,362 --> 00:43:34,782
these things that they believe
give their life meaning.

737
00:43:37,826 --> 00:43:39,576
I hear you.

738
00:43:39,578 --> 00:43:41,828
Who are these people you
asked to be released?

739
00:43:41,830 --> 00:43:44,581
I don't know.

740
00:43:44,583 --> 00:43:49,169
Ruke gave me their names
based off their confessions.

741
00:43:49,171 --> 00:43:50,587
You see, if you
give law enforcement

742
00:43:50,589 --> 00:43:52,714
a large enough task,
they will bury themselves

743
00:43:52,716 --> 00:43:57,010
in it before they realize
they've been duped.

744
00:43:57,012 --> 00:43:59,596
Do you understand?

745
00:43:59,598 --> 00:44:00,473
Yes, I do.

746
00:44:03,226 --> 00:44:04,687
You're too smart to be in here.

747
00:44:13,403 --> 00:44:15,278
Somebody just killed two of us.

748
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:16,572
Who?

749
00:44:16,574 --> 00:44:18,323
I didn't get a good
look at him, man.

750
00:44:18,325 --> 00:44:20,576
Fucking smoke grenade.

751
00:44:20,578 --> 00:44:22,911
He wasn't dressed like no cop.

752
00:44:22,913 --> 00:44:23,579
Bomber?

753
00:44:23,581 --> 00:44:25,958
Cruz?

754
00:44:28,794 --> 00:44:29,587
We got a problem.

755
00:44:31,922 --> 00:44:35,006
Someone is clearly not
playing by the rules.

756
00:44:37,886 --> 00:44:39,302
Chandler, hey.

757
00:44:39,304 --> 00:44:41,179
Hey, can you to fill me in?

758
00:44:41,181 --> 00:44:43,807
Someone is killing my men.

759
00:44:43,809 --> 00:44:45,851
I gave a warning in my
initial announcement.

760
00:44:45,853 --> 00:44:48,353
Nobody comes in, nobody
plays hero today.

761
00:44:54,027 --> 00:44:54,860
Shit.

762
00:45:09,918 --> 00:45:11,334
Who is it?

763
00:45:11,336 --> 00:45:12,168
Alex?

764
00:45:12,170 --> 00:45:14,045
Alex?

765
00:45:14,047 --> 00:45:15,756
How'd you get the name?

766
00:45:15,758 --> 00:45:18,717
Ah, the same way I figured
out, you know, the janitor.

767
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:21,553
Listen, I've already told
you guys I'm on your side.

768
00:45:21,555 --> 00:45:23,096
We know that.

769
00:45:23,098 --> 00:45:24,389
Look, we need you out.

770
00:45:24,391 --> 00:45:26,266
You've made your presence
known and Chandler

771
00:45:26,268 --> 00:45:27,601
has begun executing hostages.

772
00:45:27,603 --> 00:45:30,687
You know, I'm not
sure about that.

773
00:45:30,689 --> 00:45:31,897
Why?

774
00:45:31,899 --> 00:45:33,314
Well, I've seen more than
half of this damn place

775
00:45:33,316 --> 00:45:35,692
and I haven't seen
a single hostage.

776
00:45:35,694 --> 00:45:38,654
And I've got to tell you,
I've got a bad feeling.

777
00:45:38,656 --> 00:45:41,072
Well, let's hope
you're wrong, OK?

778
00:45:41,074 --> 00:45:45,243
Listen, you've got to
do me another favor.

779
00:45:45,245 --> 00:45:46,077
What's that?

780
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:47,120
OK.

781
00:45:47,122 --> 00:45:48,580
The prison inmates
that were released,

782
00:45:48,582 --> 00:45:53,001
any go by the name
of Vincent Barros?

783
00:45:53,003 --> 00:45:55,295
Vincent Barros?

784
00:45:55,297 --> 00:45:55,923
No.

785
00:45:58,383 --> 00:45:59,675
OK.

786
00:45:59,677 --> 00:46:01,845
I'm assuming you already
know that's my son.

787
00:46:05,182 --> 00:46:06,723
That means he's still here.

788
00:46:06,725 --> 00:46:10,268
In all likelihood, yes.

789
00:46:13,398 --> 00:46:13,982
Vinny.

790
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:18,236
I don't know what's going on.

791
00:46:23,075 --> 00:46:31,164
There
is a snake in the henhouse.

792
00:46:31,166 --> 00:46:36,336
There is someone in here
stealing your freedom.

793
00:46:36,338 --> 00:46:37,255
Killing your friends.

794
00:46:40,258 --> 00:46:41,176
It is not a cop.

795
00:46:43,679 --> 00:46:44,680
I know cops.

796
00:46:48,141 --> 00:46:51,643
Special forces, it's
the only kind of person

797
00:46:51,645 --> 00:46:55,689
to be able to stay
undetected this long.

798
00:46:55,691 --> 00:47:00,736
So what do we get
if we take him down?

799
00:47:00,738 --> 00:47:02,821
Oh, you want a reward?

800
00:47:02,823 --> 00:47:04,573
Someone's out there
taking us out.

801
00:47:04,575 --> 00:47:07,576
It's only right if
we get more money.

802
00:47:07,578 --> 00:47:10,411
OK, fine.

803
00:47:10,413 --> 00:47:14,500
$1 million to whoever
brings me that motherfucker.

804
00:47:14,502 --> 00:47:15,085
Dead.

805
00:47:18,338 --> 00:47:19,254
Let's go.

806
00:47:20,007 --> 00:47:20,674
Yes, sir.

807
00:47:24,803 --> 00:47:25,594
Bring him to me.

808
00:48:41,254 --> 00:48:43,589
Oh.

809
00:48:43,591 --> 00:48:46,382
Hey.

810
00:48:46,384 --> 00:48:47,344
I found the hostages.

811
00:48:49,847 --> 00:48:50,887
I don't like that tone.

812
00:48:50,889 --> 00:48:54,057
I know that tone.

813
00:48:54,059 --> 00:48:57,393
They're all dead, right?

814
00:48:57,395 --> 00:49:00,065
Yeah, every one of them.

815
00:49:05,571 --> 00:49:07,863
Every single one of them.

816
00:49:14,788 --> 00:49:15,873
Ah, shit.

817
00:49:18,501 --> 00:49:21,209
Hmm, that felt good.

818
00:49:21,211 --> 00:49:25,922
Might as well get in the may day

819
00:49:34,683 --> 00:49:36,767
You let me go.

820
00:49:36,769 --> 00:49:38,268
You let me go.

821
00:49:39,396 --> 00:49:42,188
Let me go.

822
00:49:42,190 --> 00:49:43,526
You need to try harder.

823
00:49:49,615 --> 00:49:53,950
Let me show you what
a stabbing looks like.

824
00:50:48,048 --> 00:50:49,881
OK.

825
00:50:49,883 --> 00:50:52,217
Come on.

826
00:51:12,698 --> 00:51:14,155
Alex?

827
00:51:16,994 --> 00:51:19,995
Chandler.

828
00:51:19,997 --> 00:51:20,623
That's right.

829
00:51:22,833 --> 00:51:25,458
I figured I'd keep this
one just between friends.

830
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:28,587
Yeah, well, since we're friends,
I guess you should know.

831
00:51:28,589 --> 00:51:31,632
I-- I know your little secret.

832
00:51:31,634 --> 00:51:35,010
Oh, what's that?

833
00:51:35,012 --> 00:51:36,302
Oh, come on.

834
00:51:36,304 --> 00:51:38,807
The hostages,
they're already dead.

835
00:51:42,770 --> 00:51:45,061
Let me guess, your little
friend on the inside,

836
00:51:45,063 --> 00:51:47,022
what's his name, Alex?

837
00:51:47,024 --> 00:51:48,106
Did he tell you that?

838
00:51:48,108 --> 00:51:49,941
Is that right?

839
00:51:49,943 --> 00:51:52,277
That's right.

840
00:51:52,279 --> 00:51:54,613
And how do you know
it wasn't your friend?

841
00:51:54,615 --> 00:51:57,448
Because I know his type
and you should too.

842
00:51:57,450 --> 00:52:00,326
I mean, it used to
be a cop, right?

843
00:52:00,328 --> 00:52:04,330
I can't get anything
past you, John.

844
00:52:04,332 --> 00:52:06,332
So where does that leave us?

845
00:52:06,334 --> 00:52:07,918
Well, this gets
to the higher-ups

846
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:10,962
and SWAT comes and then wipes
floor with your stupid ass.

847
00:52:10,964 --> 00:52:13,173
That's about it.

848
00:52:13,175 --> 00:52:14,718
Unless you didn't tell them.

849
00:52:18,514 --> 00:52:21,139
You didn't, did you?

850
00:52:21,141 --> 00:52:21,725
No.

851
00:52:26,647 --> 00:52:31,024
You really have a lot of faith
in your friend Alex, don't you?

852
00:52:31,026 --> 00:52:33,151
I do.

853
00:52:33,153 --> 00:52:35,153
So where does this leave us now?

854
00:52:35,155 --> 00:52:36,780
You're still working
on your friends.

855
00:52:36,782 --> 00:52:38,198
Chopper's en route.

856
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:40,701
I can't promise transportation
to anywhere other than Mexico.

857
00:52:40,703 --> 00:52:43,161
And once you make it
there, you're on your own.

858
00:52:43,163 --> 00:52:45,581
You won't be protected.

859
00:52:45,583 --> 00:52:46,998
Yeah.

860
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,208
Win some, you lose some.

861
00:53:29,334 --> 00:53:29,918
Vinny?

862
00:53:32,963 --> 00:53:34,840
Dad, what the fuck?

863
00:53:38,511 --> 00:53:40,969
I should have fucking
known it was you.

864
00:53:40,971 --> 00:53:42,345
What does that mean?

865
00:53:42,347 --> 00:53:43,597
You stayed behind.

866
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:45,056
I wanted to stay behind.

867
00:53:45,058 --> 00:53:46,975
I was in the bathroom
when the bomb went off.

868
00:53:46,977 --> 00:53:48,727
Yeah, and then you
went into old ways,

869
00:53:48,729 --> 00:53:51,730
picking our guys off one by
one like it's a fucking wraith.

870
00:53:51,732 --> 00:53:53,774
I thought you only killed
people for a paycheck.

871
00:53:53,776 --> 00:53:55,108
Now's not the time for that.

872
00:53:55,110 --> 00:53:57,903
Now what did you say, our guys?

873
00:53:57,905 --> 00:54:00,321
Yeah, our guys.

874
00:54:00,323 --> 00:54:01,615
Oh, Vinny.

875
00:54:01,617 --> 00:54:02,908
Come on, man.

876
00:54:02,910 --> 00:54:03,742
What are you-- what
are you thinking?

877
00:54:03,744 --> 00:54:04,576
What are you doing?

878
00:54:04,578 --> 00:54:06,036
It's not the way.

879
00:54:06,038 --> 00:54:08,914
Max makes perfect sense.

880
00:54:08,916 --> 00:54:10,749
And he's one of the
few people I've ever

881
00:54:10,751 --> 00:54:14,586
met who knows how fucked
up the world really is.

882
00:54:14,588 --> 00:54:16,337
Trust me, Vinny,
there's a lot of people

883
00:54:16,339 --> 00:54:17,881
who feel the same way.

884
00:54:17,883 --> 00:54:23,386
Yeah, but they don't do a
damn thing about it, do they?

885
00:54:23,388 --> 00:54:24,345
Listen to your father.

886
00:54:24,347 --> 00:54:25,931
I've been there, OK?

887
00:54:25,933 --> 00:54:28,141
I've seen some horrible things.

888
00:54:28,143 --> 00:54:30,602
I've seen fucked up.

889
00:54:30,604 --> 00:54:32,771
And I've also seen things
worth fighting for.

890
00:54:32,773 --> 00:54:34,815
And I'm telling you,
this ain't one of them.

891
00:54:34,817 --> 00:54:36,942
You fight for a cause?

892
00:54:36,944 --> 00:54:40,737
Well, so do I. We're
more similar than I ever

893
00:54:40,739 --> 00:54:42,280
would have hoped.

894
00:54:42,282 --> 00:54:45,826
But what you did was legal.

895
00:54:45,828 --> 00:54:49,538
Vinny, this is real life
we're talking about.

896
00:54:49,540 --> 00:54:53,667
If you decide to leave here with
Max, you'll be shot on sight.

897
00:54:53,669 --> 00:54:54,626
Yeah, why's that?

898
00:54:54,628 --> 00:54:56,044
Why do you think?

899
00:54:56,046 --> 00:54:59,255
If only you knew
the fucking truth.

900
00:54:59,257 --> 00:55:02,258
You're the only one here
who's killing anybody.

901
00:55:02,260 --> 00:55:03,259
Oh, Jesus, Vinny.

902
00:55:03,261 --> 00:55:04,427
It's true.

903
00:55:04,429 --> 00:55:06,597
You're the only one
killing anybody.

904
00:55:06,599 --> 00:55:09,182
Max hasn't fucking
touched the hostages.

905
00:55:09,184 --> 00:55:10,517
That's not true, Vinny.

906
00:55:10,519 --> 00:55:11,560
Yes, it is.

907
00:55:11,562 --> 00:55:12,894
It's what he wants you to think.

908
00:55:12,896 --> 00:55:15,647
That whole PA, execution
shit, that's bullshit.

909
00:55:15,649 --> 00:55:18,525
You should know that.

910
00:55:18,527 --> 00:55:19,776
Shh.

911
00:55:19,778 --> 00:55:23,363
Vinny, the hostages are dead.

912
00:55:23,365 --> 00:55:24,531
Shut up.

913
00:55:24,533 --> 00:55:25,824
The hostages are dead.

914
00:55:25,826 --> 00:55:27,868
Don't try to fucking lie to me.

915
00:55:27,870 --> 00:55:29,035
I'm not lying to you.

916
00:55:29,037 --> 00:55:32,413
Stop being so fucking naive.

917
00:55:32,415 --> 00:55:34,207
Take a look at yourself.

918
00:55:34,209 --> 00:55:34,875
Don't you--

919
00:55:34,877 --> 00:55:36,752
Look where you are.

920
00:55:36,754 --> 00:55:38,629
Just stop being so
fucking naive, OK?

921
00:55:38,631 --> 00:55:40,421
That's what I used
to tell your mother.

922
00:55:40,423 --> 00:55:41,840
She used to listen everybody.

923
00:55:41,842 --> 00:55:42,924
Talking about my mother!

924
00:55:42,926 --> 00:55:44,134
Well, I'm trying
to tell you, you

925
00:55:44,136 --> 00:55:46,595
don't make the
same mistakes, OK?

926
00:55:46,597 --> 00:55:47,596
What are you--

927
00:55:47,598 --> 00:55:48,930
What kind of fucking mistakes?

928
00:55:48,932 --> 00:55:50,849
You're the only one
making a mistake here.

929
00:55:50,851 --> 00:55:53,059
Vinny, you're doing
the stupidest thing

930
00:55:53,061 --> 00:55:55,896
you could do, so
stop being naive

931
00:55:55,898 --> 00:55:57,731
and stop being like your mom.

932
00:55:57,733 --> 00:55:58,607
Like my mom?

933
00:55:58,609 --> 00:55:59,775
Listen to me.

934
00:55:59,777 --> 00:56:00,984
Tell me more about
my mom then, huh?

935
00:56:00,986 --> 00:56:03,987
As if you fucking
knew her like me.

936
00:56:03,989 --> 00:56:04,988
Vinny.

937
00:56:04,990 --> 00:56:07,073
You don't even know me.

938
00:56:07,075 --> 00:56:08,909
Stop it.

939
00:56:08,911 --> 00:56:11,119
You're being stupid, OK?

940
00:56:11,121 --> 00:56:13,204
I'm not going to tell you again.

941
00:56:13,206 --> 00:56:16,166
Your decision, what
are you going to do?

942
00:56:16,168 --> 00:56:18,502
Think about it.

943
00:56:18,504 --> 00:56:20,712
Come on, what are
you going to do?

944
00:56:20,714 --> 00:56:23,674
Fucking hate you, yo.

945
00:56:23,676 --> 00:56:25,759
But I'm not going to kill you.

946
00:56:32,685 --> 00:56:35,727
Get the fuck out of
here while you can.

947
00:56:35,729 --> 00:56:38,188
All right, dad?

948
00:56:38,190 --> 00:56:39,355
Oh, Jesus.

949
00:56:39,357 --> 00:56:41,109
Get the fuck out of here.

950
00:56:53,288 --> 00:56:54,746
One for you.

951
00:56:54,748 --> 00:56:56,289
You wanna talk to it?

952
00:56:56,291 --> 00:56:56,873
Yeah.

953
00:56:59,753 --> 00:57:00,627
What?

954
00:57:00,629 --> 00:57:01,252
I don't know.

955
00:57:01,254 --> 00:57:01,962
Nothing.

956
00:57:01,964 --> 00:57:02,671
Don't worry about it.

957
00:57:03,507 --> 00:57:04,965
on EMT.

958
00:57:04,967 --> 00:57:06,675
Don't worry about it.

959
00:57:28,616 --> 00:57:32,659
Come on.

960
00:58:33,346 --> 00:58:33,764
Oh.

961
00:58:39,102 --> 00:58:44,523
Rhino? Rhino?

962
00:58:50,447 --> 00:58:51,156
Rhino, come in.

963
00:58:54,117 --> 00:58:56,704
Uh, Rhino, no,
he ain't come back.

964
00:58:59,331 --> 00:59:04,000
Alex, nice to meet you.

965
00:59:04,002 --> 00:59:07,128
Can't say I feel the same way.

966
00:59:07,130 --> 00:59:10,632
You've killed quite a
few of my men today.

967
00:59:10,634 --> 00:59:12,634
They had it coming.

968
00:59:12,636 --> 00:59:16,221
An unfortunate
side-effect of progress.

969
00:59:16,223 --> 00:59:17,848
You spend enough
time and a place

970
00:59:17,850 --> 00:59:20,934
like this you'd understand,
but you wouldn't get that,

971
00:59:20,936 --> 00:59:22,894
would you?

972
00:59:22,896 --> 00:59:25,146
Believe me, I would.

973
00:59:27,484 --> 00:59:29,277
Where did you do your time?

974
00:59:33,824 --> 00:59:37,075
Marawi City, Philippines.

975
00:59:37,077 --> 00:59:40,245
We flew into expected
Congressman's plane went down

976
00:59:40,247 --> 00:59:44,750
and I lost my whole unit.

977
00:59:44,752 --> 00:59:48,253
Ended up in some POW camp.

978
00:59:48,255 --> 00:59:50,421
I had to fight my own way
out because the government

979
00:59:50,423 --> 00:59:51,757
wouldn't come to terms.

980
00:59:51,759 --> 00:59:57,929
And so good news is, got
an honorable discharge.

981
00:59:57,931 --> 01:00:02,017
But the pension pays about as
much as a fast food manager,

982
01:00:02,019 --> 01:00:04,019
so I'm fine.

983
01:00:04,021 --> 01:00:04,605
I'm good.

984
01:00:08,316 --> 01:00:11,484
I made a career in the LAPD.

985
01:00:11,486 --> 01:00:14,112
Had one bad session with
the staff psychiatrist

986
01:00:14,114 --> 01:00:18,283
and I got put on leave with a
severance where I couldn't even

987
01:00:18,285 --> 01:00:20,661
afford a studio in
South Central LA.

988
01:00:20,663 --> 01:00:23,582
But I found my higher calling.

989
01:00:26,418 --> 01:00:30,086
Yeah, I remember your name.

990
01:00:30,088 --> 01:00:31,672
Ex-hero cop who
turned Unabomber.

991
01:00:31,674 --> 01:00:33,464
But I got to tell
you something, Max.

992
01:00:33,466 --> 01:00:36,384
I'm not sure a bad psych
evaluation is worth

993
01:00:36,386 --> 01:00:39,638
killing all these innocent
people, you get me?

994
01:00:39,640 --> 01:00:41,682
Oh, I only killed
people who were

995
01:00:41,684 --> 01:00:45,852
responsible for the social
and economic downfall

996
01:00:45,854 --> 01:00:48,188
of this nation.

997
01:00:48,190 --> 01:00:50,400
I sympathize with
you on that one, pal.

998
01:00:52,736 --> 01:00:58,239
You give your life to a cause
then they spit in your face.

999
01:00:58,241 --> 01:00:59,908
For no reason.

1000
01:00:59,910 --> 01:01:05,747
Other than that, no use for
you in one way whatsoever.

1001
01:01:05,749 --> 01:01:07,666
Your particular
case, Max, I think

1002
01:01:07,668 --> 01:01:10,752
it's time maybe you cash it in.

1003
01:01:10,754 --> 01:01:13,547
Call it in or call
it a day, pal.

1004
01:01:13,549 --> 01:01:16,675
Maybe they'll look after you.

1005
01:01:16,677 --> 01:01:18,259
They only kept me
alive because I've

1006
01:01:18,261 --> 01:01:22,263
been leaking Intel to the FBI.

1007
01:01:22,265 --> 01:01:24,015
You know, after
today, I don't think

1008
01:01:24,017 --> 01:01:27,352
they'll have any use for
me, kind of like the LAPD

1009
01:01:27,354 --> 01:01:29,270
after I divulged my feelings.

1010
01:01:29,272 --> 01:01:34,985
No, it's-- it's too
late for me, Alex.

1011
01:01:34,987 --> 01:01:37,654
I hear you.

1012
01:01:37,656 --> 01:01:40,616
Then let's make a deal.

1013
01:01:40,618 --> 01:01:46,705
If it's a cop that's going
to take you out, go with me.

1014
01:01:46,707 --> 01:01:48,458
I'll make sure it's me first.

1015
01:01:52,588 --> 01:01:56,131
You know there's one thing
that we forgot to discuss.

1016
01:01:56,133 --> 01:01:57,674
Yeah, what's that?

1017
01:01:57,676 --> 01:01:59,467
Well, you're not a cop.

1018
01:01:59,469 --> 01:02:02,220
You're not a
corrections officer.

1019
01:02:02,222 --> 01:02:05,392
So who are you?

1020
01:02:09,312 --> 01:02:10,022
I'm the janitor.

1021
01:02:12,482 --> 01:02:16,067
Bullshit.

1022
01:02:16,069 --> 01:02:18,194
You wouldn't be here
right now unless you were

1023
01:02:18,196 --> 01:02:20,155
trying to get somebody out.

1024
01:02:52,815 --> 01:02:54,355
Which one is this, huh?

1025
01:02:54,357 --> 01:02:55,566
This is me too, Alex.

1026
01:02:55,568 --> 01:02:56,567
Hey, thank God for that.

1027
01:02:56,569 --> 01:02:58,068
Alex, hey.

1028
01:02:58,070 --> 01:03:00,111
They have my son.

1029
01:03:00,113 --> 01:03:00,737
What?

1030
01:03:00,739 --> 01:03:01,780
He was a hostage?

1031
01:03:01,782 --> 01:03:03,114
No, no, no, he's not a hostage.

1032
01:03:03,116 --> 01:03:05,534
Somehow Max convinced
him to join the team.

1033
01:03:05,536 --> 01:03:07,035
OK, listen, man.

1034
01:03:07,037 --> 01:03:08,995
There's a helicopter
coming right now

1035
01:03:08,997 --> 01:03:11,665
and he thinks it's going
to take him to the border.

1036
01:03:11,667 --> 01:03:14,710
The thing is, he doesn't
know that my superiors are

1037
01:03:14,712 --> 01:03:17,796
aware he's executed
the hostages already.

1038
01:03:17,798 --> 01:03:21,007
So once the helicopter
takes off, Chandler's dead.

1039
01:03:21,009 --> 01:03:22,509
And then SWAT's
gonna go in there

1040
01:03:22,511 --> 01:03:24,385
and take out the
rest of his team.

1041
01:03:24,387 --> 01:03:27,347
And that's it.

1042
01:03:27,349 --> 01:03:29,516
Did you hear me, Alex?

1043
01:03:29,518 --> 01:03:33,228
No, wait, what-- wait, wait.

1044
01:03:33,230 --> 01:03:35,271
Don't let them kill my son.

1045
01:03:35,273 --> 01:03:37,858
Look, I'm afraid it's out
of my hands at this point.

1046
01:03:37,860 --> 01:03:39,653
It's out of my
hands at this point.

1047
01:03:42,114 --> 01:03:44,364
How long do I have?

1048
01:03:44,366 --> 01:03:46,324
Not long.

1049
01:03:46,326 --> 01:03:47,868
Minutes.

1050
01:03:47,870 --> 01:03:49,244
That's all I need.

1051
01:04:08,098 --> 01:04:11,266
Stay frostie.
It's getting done.

1052
01:04:11,268 --> 01:04:12,809
He's going to smile.

1053
01:04:12,811 --> 01:04:13,977
All right, gentlemen?

1054
01:04:13,979 --> 01:04:15,353
That's what I'm
here for now, buddy.

1055
01:04:15,355 --> 01:04:16,437
You like the sound of that?

1056
01:04:16,439 --> 01:04:18,982
A well-earned rest.

1057
01:04:18,984 --> 01:04:21,276
Well, especially after our last.

1058
01:04:21,278 --> 01:04:21,693
Oh.

1059
01:04:21,695 --> 01:04:22,986
Right?

1060
01:04:22,988 --> 01:04:25,030
Yeah, stuff is harder than that.

1061
01:04:25,032 --> 01:04:26,615
That go his way?

1062
01:04:35,834 --> 01:04:38,126
...just that nice
long vacation.

1063
01:04:38,128 --> 01:04:39,878
Aww, man.

1064
01:04:39,880 --> 01:04:41,505
I got that new girl
I'm gonna take.

1065
01:04:41,507 --> 01:04:43,006
There you go.

1066
01:04:43,008 --> 01:04:44,508
Money well spent, I hope.

1067
01:04:44,510 --> 01:04:45,509
Yeah.

1068
01:04:45,511 --> 01:04:49,345
All it does is cost more.

1069
01:04:49,347 --> 01:04:50,681
Spend wisely.

1070
01:04:53,435 --> 01:04:54,184
Not tonight.

1071
01:04:54,186 --> 01:04:56,394
No exhume.

1072
01:04:56,396 --> 01:04:57,563
Back to the job stuff.

1073
01:04:57,565 --> 01:04:58,730
You're a smarter man than me.

1074
01:04:58,732 --> 01:05:00,065
Nah.

1075
01:05:00,067 --> 01:05:01,274
It's wise to
hold down, right?

1076
01:05:01,276 --> 01:05:01,733
Let's do it.

1077
01:05:01,735 --> 01:05:03,151
Yeah.

1078
01:05:03,153 --> 01:05:05,529
Spend a nice long vacation.

1079
01:05:05,531 --> 01:05:07,363
Aww, yeah.

1080
01:05:07,365 --> 01:05:08,949
Get that girl in there.

1081
01:05:08,951 --> 01:05:09,575
There you go.

1082
01:05:09,577 --> 01:05:10,450
Hey.

1083
01:08:11,675 --> 01:08:14,219
Moment. Take
Delta at three...

1084
01:08:14,512 --> 01:08:18,265
Remember
shoot on..

1085
01:08:25,438 --> 01:08:27,313
Wow.

1086
01:08:27,315 --> 01:08:28,651
You're the snake.

1087
01:08:31,904 --> 01:08:32,780
I hate snakes.

1088
01:09:17,449 --> 01:09:19,240
It's all good.

1089
01:09:19,242 --> 01:09:22,744
I can do this all day.

1090
01:09:22,746 --> 01:09:23,622
Are you ready?

1091
01:09:26,083 --> 01:09:26,915
Yeah.

1092
01:09:45,143 --> 01:09:48,520
It's disappointing.

1093
01:09:48,522 --> 01:09:52,608
I bet you were a bad
dude back in the day.

1094
01:09:52,610 --> 01:09:54,776
And now, you're old.

1095
01:09:54,778 --> 01:09:55,445
You're tired.

1096
01:09:57,906 --> 01:10:01,407
What are you anyway, hm?

1097
01:10:01,409 --> 01:10:02,784
Army?

1098
01:10:02,786 --> 01:10:05,996
Special forces?

1099
01:10:05,998 --> 01:10:09,165
Navy SEAL?

1100
01:10:09,167 --> 01:10:11,334
No, no, no.

1101
01:10:11,336 --> 01:10:13,044
I know what you are.

1102
01:10:13,046 --> 01:10:15,589
The only way you could have
creeped around all day picking

1103
01:10:15,591 --> 01:10:16,673
us off one by one.

1104
01:10:16,675 --> 01:10:19,134
You're a rough fucking ninja.

1105
01:10:25,893 --> 01:10:28,393
Black Ops.

1106
01:10:28,395 --> 01:10:30,145
I know the type.

1107
01:10:30,147 --> 01:10:35,191
I think someone like you
will be used to the pain.

1108
01:10:35,193 --> 01:10:39,530
I spent weeks in a Taliban
camp in Afghanistan

1109
01:10:39,532 --> 01:10:41,072
being waterboarded.

1110
01:10:41,074 --> 01:10:44,660
I thought for sure I
was dead at one point.

1111
01:10:44,662 --> 01:10:50,040
Then, the goddamn American
army came in guns blazing.

1112
01:10:50,042 --> 01:10:57,589
Turns out the British patrol
missed me by barely 50 feet.

1113
01:10:57,591 --> 01:11:02,010
Those motherfuckers just
didn't look hard enough.

1114
01:11:02,012 --> 01:11:06,598
That's when I knew guys
like Max had it right.

1115
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:10,435
We're all expendable
to those in charge.

1116
01:11:10,437 --> 01:11:15,691
And the only way you get them
to listen is to light a fire

1117
01:11:15,693 --> 01:11:17,110
and watch them run.

1118
01:11:23,408 --> 01:11:24,115
Yeah.

1119
01:11:29,331 --> 01:11:31,247
Hm.

1120
01:11:31,249 --> 01:11:32,791
Fighting to the end, huh?

1121
01:11:32,793 --> 01:11:34,292
It seems like
you've been around.

1122
01:11:35,337 --> 01:11:36,795
OK.

1123
01:11:36,797 --> 01:11:38,088
Now, let me take you somewhere
that you haven't been.

1124
01:11:38,090 --> 01:11:38,839
Let's do it.

1125
01:11:38,841 --> 01:11:39,339
Yeah.

1126
01:12:32,603 --> 01:12:33,935
Your ride's here.

1127
01:12:33,937 --> 01:12:36,312
Be on the move in
five minutes, not six.

1128
01:12:36,314 --> 01:12:37,313
Five.

1129
01:12:37,315 --> 01:12:39,357
Good.

1130
01:12:39,359 --> 01:12:41,276
Five minutes.

1131
01:12:41,278 --> 01:12:42,110
What about the others?

1132
01:12:42,112 --> 01:12:43,737
They're not going to make it.

1133
01:12:43,739 --> 01:12:45,947
Let's go.

1134
01:12:45,949 --> 01:12:47,908
What do you mean they're
not going to make it?

1135
01:12:47,910 --> 01:12:48,867
I mean they're not
going to make it.

1136
01:12:48,869 --> 01:12:49,912
Is there a problem?

1137
01:12:56,334 --> 01:12:57,085
Are you coming?

1138
01:12:58,921 --> 01:13:01,046
If you are, you probably
want to leave the gun here.

1139
01:13:01,048 --> 01:13:03,549
They will shoot you on site.

1140
01:13:03,551 --> 01:13:04,176
Problem?

1141
01:13:07,345 --> 01:13:08,512
No.

1142
01:13:08,514 --> 01:13:10,096
Good.

1143
01:13:10,098 --> 01:13:10,724
Let's go.

1144
01:13:27,490 --> 01:13:28,239
Ha!

1145
01:13:28,241 --> 01:13:29,076
Right on time.

1146
01:13:36,208 --> 01:13:40,627
Oh, I should learn to
trust my instincts.

1147
01:13:40,629 --> 01:13:41,753
He's here for you, isn't he?

1148
01:13:47,720 --> 01:13:48,428
Who is he?

1149
01:13:51,348 --> 01:13:53,014
Huh?

1150
01:13:53,016 --> 01:13:53,765
Your brother?

1151
01:13:53,767 --> 01:13:54,474
Your uncle?

1152
01:13:54,476 --> 01:13:55,183
Your cousin?

1153
01:13:55,185 --> 01:13:55,310
Who is he?

1154
01:14:02,442 --> 01:14:04,484
He's my father.

1155
01:14:04,486 --> 01:14:06,612
He's your father?

1156
01:14:06,614 --> 01:14:09,282
I should
have known that.

1157
01:14:11,952 --> 01:14:13,118
I don't care about him.

1158
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:15,829
I don't even fucking like him.

1159
01:14:15,831 --> 01:14:18,624
Let's test that theory.

1160
01:14:18,626 --> 01:14:20,917
How about when he comes up
here, you take this gun,

1161
01:14:20,919 --> 01:14:22,418
and you point it at him?

1162
01:14:22,420 --> 01:14:25,463
You can put a
bullet in his head.

1163
01:14:25,465 --> 01:14:28,592
How do you know I'm not
going to point it at you?

1164
01:14:28,594 --> 01:14:31,177
Oh, I don't.

1165
01:14:31,179 --> 01:14:32,387
Let's play a little game.

1166
01:14:32,389 --> 01:14:33,098
Let's find out.

1167
01:14:38,979 --> 01:14:40,438
You want it?

1168
01:14:43,191 --> 01:14:44,652
Take it.

1169
01:14:47,530 --> 01:14:48,695
Take it.

1170
01:14:48,697 --> 01:14:49,613
, kid.

1171
01:14:49,615 --> 01:14:50,405
Take the gun.

1172
01:14:50,407 --> 01:14:50,989
Fuck off.

1173
01:14:50,991 --> 01:14:51,740
Take the gun.

1174
01:14:51,742 --> 01:14:53,950
Point it at me.

1175
01:14:53,952 --> 01:14:54,993
That's right.

1176
01:14:54,995 --> 01:14:56,537
It feels good in your hand, huh?

1177
01:14:56,539 --> 01:14:58,413
Now, all you've got to
do is point it at me

1178
01:14:58,415 --> 01:15:00,582
and pull the fucking trigger.

1179
01:15:00,584 --> 01:15:02,959
You're in control of
your own fucking destiny.

1180
01:15:02,961 --> 01:15:04,002
Do you want to be with me?

1181
01:15:04,004 --> 01:15:05,045
Do you want to be with your dad?

1182
01:15:05,047 --> 01:15:05,879
Do you want to be with yourself?

1183
01:15:05,881 --> 01:15:08,173
What do you want?

1184
01:15:08,175 --> 01:15:11,051
Point it at me.

1185
01:15:16,892 --> 01:15:19,434
That's it.

1186
01:15:19,436 --> 01:15:21,186
Higher.

1187
01:15:21,188 --> 01:15:22,646
Point the gun at my face.

1188
01:15:22,648 --> 01:15:23,772
Pull the trigger.

1189
01:15:23,774 --> 01:15:26,066
That's right.

1190
01:15:26,068 --> 01:15:27,235
You can do it.

1191
01:15:32,616 --> 01:15:34,032
That's right.

1192
01:15:34,034 --> 01:15:35,617
That's right.

1193
01:15:37,621 --> 01:15:40,413
It's hard to hold it still
with a helicopter up above you,

1194
01:15:40,415 --> 01:15:41,456
isn't it?

1195
01:15:41,458 --> 01:15:44,459
See, now that is control.

1196
01:15:44,461 --> 01:15:45,627
Do it.

1197
01:15:45,629 --> 01:15:46,377
Pull the trigger.

1198
01:15:46,379 --> 01:15:46,797
Shut up!

1199
01:15:59,101 --> 01:16:02,185
You have an amazing
new life ahead of you.

1200
01:16:02,187 --> 01:16:03,647
I'm proud of you.

1201
01:16:06,525 --> 01:16:07,150
Let's go.

1202
01:16:10,237 --> 01:16:11,319
Alex!

1203
01:16:11,321 --> 01:16:12,239
Dad.

1204
01:16:12,740 --> 01:16:15,156
You come to see us off?

1205
01:16:15,158 --> 01:16:16,658
Nope.

1206
01:16:16,660 --> 01:16:18,660
Vincent, are you OK?

1207
01:16:18,662 --> 01:16:20,787
Good.

1208
01:16:20,789 --> 01:16:21,705
You?

1209
01:16:21,707 --> 01:16:22,247
Yeah, I'm good.

1210
01:16:22,249 --> 01:16:22,914
Come here, son.

1211
01:16:22,916 --> 01:16:24,165
Come.

1212
01:16:27,755 --> 01:16:28,754
Dad!

1213
01:16:28,756 --> 01:16:29,713
No, no, no, no, no.

1214
01:16:29,715 --> 01:16:30,088
Dad.

1215
01:16:30,090 --> 01:16:31,006
Dad.

1216
01:16:31,008 --> 01:16:31,840
Dad, where are you hit?

1217
01:16:31,842 --> 01:16:32,591
Where are you hit?

1218
01:16:33,010 --> 01:16:33,717
Come on.

1219
01:16:33,719 --> 01:16:34,217
I got you.

1220
01:16:34,219 --> 01:16:35,969
I got you.

1221
01:16:35,971 --> 01:16:37,178
I'm good, Vinny.

1222
01:16:37,180 --> 01:16:39,014
Took my right arm.
Lift the gun.

1223
01:16:39,016 --> 01:16:40,056
Lift the gun.

1224
01:16:40,058 --> 01:16:40,807
OK.

1225
01:16:40,809 --> 01:16:41,432
Lift the gun.

1226
01:16:41,434 --> 01:16:42,100
OK.

1227
01:17:08,587 --> 01:17:09,169
Do it.

1228
01:17:12,340 --> 01:17:14,340
Finish it.

1229
01:17:18,346 --> 01:17:19,515
I'm tired.

1230
01:17:56,802 --> 01:17:58,594
Oh, my son.

1231
01:17:58,596 --> 01:18:02,138
You know, you have grown
big like your grandfather.

1232
01:18:02,140 --> 01:18:04,224
He was a big man.

1233
01:18:04,226 --> 01:18:05,976
I'm sorry for shooting you.

1234
01:18:05,978 --> 01:18:06,977
That's OK, son.

1235
01:18:06,979 --> 01:18:08,895
I think I deserved that one.

1236
01:18:29,710 --> 01:18:30,291
Come on.

1237
01:18:30,293 --> 01:18:30,917
Take me home.

1238
01:18:30,919 --> 01:18:31,417
Come on.

1239
01:18:31,419 --> 01:18:31,754
Let's go.

1240
01:18:35,924 --> 01:18:37,173
I got one problem.

1241
01:18:37,175 --> 01:18:40,927
You've been looking at
me, and I don't like that.

1242
01:18:40,929 --> 01:18:42,931
Get your old man
to a hospital, kid.

1243
01:19:13,045 --> 01:19:15,420
It's OK.

1244
01:19:15,422 --> 01:19:16,963
Standard

1245
01:19:16,965 --> 01:19:17,756
Stand down.

1246
01:19:17,758 --> 01:19:19,382
It's Alex Baros.

1247
01:19:29,311 --> 01:19:30,310
Good work.

1248
01:19:34,692 --> 01:19:36,650
Yeah, I am
a product of change.

1249
01:19:36,652 --> 01:19:38,276
I got the product in bags.

1250
01:19:38,278 --> 01:19:40,486
Turning my L's into

1251
01:19:40,488 --> 01:19:42,405
looking to better
their days, yeah.

1252
01:19:42,407 --> 01:19:44,950
You are a product of fear and
the man in the..

1253
01:19:44,952 --> 01:19:46,326
You can't get away
from them bags.

1254
01:19:46,328 --> 01:19:49,037
And I am aware, fully
prepared to

1255
01:19:49,039 --> 01:19:49,830
yeah.

1256
01:19:49,832 --> 01:19:51,247
And this what he said.

1257
01:19:51,249 --> 01:19:52,332
You got to get paid.

1258
01:19:52,334 --> 01:19:53,333
Do what you got to do.

1259
01:19:53,335 --> 01:19:54,250
Get to the bag.

1260
01:19:54,252 --> 01:19:55,251
Stay here tonight.

1261
01:19:55,253 --> 01:19:56,503
If I get get on that avenue.

1262
01:19:56,505 --> 01:19:57,838
You ain't cut out
for them bags, yeah.

1263
01:19:57,840 --> 01:19:59,339
You are not good enough.

1264
01:19:59,341 --> 01:20:00,841
You are the type that got
people they shouldn't love.

1265
01:20:00,843 --> 01:20:02,551
Anyone knowing you
knows that you phony.

1266
01:20:02,553 --> 01:20:03,677
You never cut out for this.

1267
01:20:03,679 --> 01:20:05,386
You say just give it up, yeah.

1268
01:20:05,388 --> 01:20:07,013
Boy, that's how they
want me to feel.

1269
01:20:07,015 --> 01:20:10,141
I am the man of the skill, king
of the hill, man of the year.

1270
01:20:10,143 --> 01:20:12,894
Finally feel like I
got it for real, yeah.

1271
01:20:12,896 --> 01:20:14,688
But all of the
voices we got them.

1272
01:20:14,690 --> 01:20:16,231
Lie to me, Hillary Rodham.

1273
01:20:16,233 --> 01:20:17,315
I just came back

1274
01:20:17,317 --> 01:20:18,859
the bottom.

1275
01:20:18,861 --> 01:20:20,652
And now, I'm going to bring
it back all the way over here.

1276
01:20:20,654 --> 01:20:21,653
