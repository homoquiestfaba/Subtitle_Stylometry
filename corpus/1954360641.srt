1
00:00:16,883 --> 00:00:20,586
<i>I felt like I had a lot of time.</i>

2
00:00:20,587 --> 00:00:22,954
I know.

3
00:00:22,955 --> 00:00:26,925
It's good.
I'm good.

4
00:00:26,926 --> 00:00:30,562
<i>Yeah. We're, um... we're
just getting off the freeway.</i>

5
00:00:30,563 --> 00:00:32,164
Yeah?

6
00:00:32,165 --> 00:00:34,633
Did, Hugh pick you up
at the office, or...

7
00:00:34,634 --> 00:00:37,236
<i>Yeah, he was coming in
from Oakland.</i>

8
00:00:37,237 --> 00:00:40,772
<i>He was late, of course.
Then I took him...</i>

9
00:00:40,773 --> 00:00:45,176
<i>And then, he took me
to some lawyer bar.</i>

10
00:00:45,177 --> 00:00:46,177
A lawyer bar?

11
00:00:47,045 --> 00:00:49,814
<i>Yeah. A lawyer bar, kind of.</i>

12
00:00:49,815 --> 00:00:53,318
<i>Yeah. I don't know. Everybody
there seemed like a lawyer.</i>

13
00:00:53,319 --> 00:00:55,453
<i>I felt like I was the only
person without a tie.</i>

14
00:00:55,454 --> 00:00:58,139
Well, maybe we should get you
a tie for emergencies.

15
00:00:59,058 --> 00:01:00,592
<i>Yeah, wardrobe emergencies.</i>

16
00:01:00,593 --> 00:01:02,227
Yeah.

17
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:06,932
<i>Anyhow, we tried to take
the freeway and...</i>

18
00:01:06,933 --> 00:01:09,701
Ke... Kevin?

19
00:01:09,702 --> 00:01:12,136
I can barely hear you.

20
00:01:12,137 --> 00:01:14,640
<i>Is that better?</i>

21
00:01:14,641 --> 00:01:16,708
Not much.

22
00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:19,577
<i>Where are you?
Are you there yet?</i>

23
00:01:19,578 --> 00:01:24,848
Yeah, I... I'm just
pulling up right now.

24
00:01:24,849 --> 00:01:27,255
I just got here.
Um...

25
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:31,623
Yeah. I'm right here.

26
00:01:31,624 --> 00:01:35,827
I... You know what? I need to parallel
park and I'm not on my earpiece.

27
00:01:35,828 --> 00:01:37,695
<i>Okay.</i>

28
00:01:37,696 --> 00:01:39,865
Are you good?

29
00:01:39,866 --> 00:01:41,565
<i>Yeah.</i>

30
00:01:41,566 --> 00:01:43,668
<i>You know, we should
talk about, you know...</i>

31
00:01:43,669 --> 00:01:45,604
<i>Maybe we can
talk about, you know,</i>

32
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:48,473
<i>that little problem before
we get into the party.</i>

33
00:01:48,474 --> 00:01:50,475
Okay.

34
00:01:50,476 --> 00:01:53,781
Is it something we should
talk about now, or...

35
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:56,714
Hello?

36
00:01:56,715 --> 00:01:58,650
Kevin?

37
00:01:58,651 --> 00:02:00,752
I lost you.

38
00:02:00,753 --> 00:02:02,421
Oh.

39
00:02:02,422 --> 00:02:03,789
Baby?

40
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:10,764
You gotta be kidding me.

41
00:02:12,429 --> 00:02:15,166
I think olive oil would be good.
A little more maybe?

42
00:02:15,167 --> 00:02:16,635
- A drizzle.
- A little more.

43
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:18,689
- Is this turning you on?
- That is hot.

44
00:02:19,638 --> 00:02:21,705
See how you're slipping?
This is...

45
00:02:21,706 --> 00:02:24,309
- It's... It's the bread, babe.
- It's the two of you with the knives that...

46
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,344
I have not had carbs for a week.

47
00:02:26,345 --> 00:02:28,145
I've been on this...
this "cleanse."

48
00:02:28,146 --> 00:02:30,281
How long have you
been cleansing for?

49
00:02:30,282 --> 00:02:32,284
About 21 days.

50
00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:34,853
I had my juice and my
smoothie earlier today...

51
00:02:34,854 --> 00:02:37,287
and I do feel very, you know...

52
00:02:37,288 --> 00:02:40,191
- Cleansed? Open?
- A little faint maybe?

53
00:02:40,192 --> 00:02:41,758
But I'm gonna eat,

54
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:43,495
I'm gonna drink
and have a good time.

55
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:45,463
Hi.

56
00:02:45,464 --> 00:02:47,098
- Hey.
- How are you guys?

57
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:49,366
Nice to see you.

58
00:02:49,367 --> 00:02:51,668
- Bend down to my level, please.
- I know.

59
00:02:51,669 --> 00:02:54,705
So, I just had Kevin on the
phone and this happened.

60
00:02:54,706 --> 00:02:56,306
It cracked.

61
00:02:56,307 --> 00:02:57,876
As I was talking to him.

62
00:02:57,877 --> 00:02:59,778
- You dropped it.
- Our connection... No, I didn't drop it.

63
00:02:59,779 --> 00:03:01,812
It just cracked
as I was holding it.

64
00:03:01,813 --> 00:03:03,582
Do you have insurance?

65
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:05,417
I... I actually
don't know if I do.

66
00:03:05,418 --> 00:03:07,719
Do you have the Skype app
I showed you?

67
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,621
No, I think it's fine. He just said
he wanted to talk about something,

68
00:03:10,622 --> 00:03:13,156
But on the news, you know,
they're talking about the comet.

69
00:03:13,157 --> 00:03:14,692
- Yeah.
- The Miller's Comet.

70
00:03:14,693 --> 00:03:17,595
And they keep telling people
that this can happen.

71
00:03:17,596 --> 00:03:19,263
Yeah. I don't think
it's the comet.

72
00:03:19,264 --> 00:03:21,333
If you have Skype,
it uses the home Wi-Fi.

73
00:03:21,334 --> 00:03:24,369
No. The interference.
They're saying things break.

74
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,874
Hey, do you want some wine?

75
00:03:30,575 --> 00:03:33,945
Did Amir mention to you that...

76
00:03:33,946 --> 00:03:36,681
he's bringing Laurie...

77
00:03:36,682 --> 00:03:38,085
to dinner?

78
00:03:39,085 --> 00:03:40,550
He's bringing Laurie?

79
00:03:40,551 --> 00:03:42,919
<i>Yeah. The Laurie.</i>

80
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:46,924
Um, no, I didn't know that.
I didn't know that.

81
00:03:46,925 --> 00:03:48,393
- Who's Laurie?
- Well, he is.

82
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:52,196
- You know Laurie.
- Oh, Mike.

83
00:03:52,197 --> 00:03:57,135
Long black hair.
Kind of vixeny.

84
00:03:57,136 --> 00:03:59,403
Wild and sexy.

85
00:03:59,404 --> 00:04:01,906
- Oh.
- Kinda strange, very mysterious.

86
00:04:01,907 --> 00:04:04,442
- Very tight, tight, tight dresses.
- Listen.

87
00:04:04,443 --> 00:04:07,144
It's totally fine.
It's such an Amir thing to do.

88
00:04:07,145 --> 00:04:08,746
I was going to keep this...

89
00:04:08,747 --> 00:04:10,781
This, my friends.

90
00:04:10,782 --> 00:04:14,686
It's my own little rescue
remedy concoction.

91
00:04:14,687 --> 00:04:17,254
- Right.
- It's our own mix.

92
00:04:17,255 --> 00:04:19,957
- It's pretty s... It's very safe, I think.
- Do you want a needle for that?

93
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:22,460
- Is it clean?
- You can drop it into some water.

94
00:04:22,461 --> 00:04:24,462
Just take the edge off,
in case you're worried.

95
00:04:24,463 --> 00:04:26,498
I don't know.
I'm just... I'm offering.

96
00:04:26,499 --> 00:04:28,833
It's echinacea, passion
flower, a little valerian...

97
00:04:29,033 --> 00:04:30,501
and ketamine.

98
00:04:30,502 --> 00:04:32,871
- So it's all natural.
- Ketamine?

99
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:35,306
That doesn't sound natural at all.
That's a horse tranquilizer.

100
00:04:35,307 --> 00:04:37,842
- Yeah, but it's just a whisper of ketamine.
- I did that once.

101
00:04:37,843 --> 00:04:39,844
I just thought maybe
a celebration...

102
00:04:39,845 --> 00:04:42,145
Are you offering this to me,
because Laurie's coming here?

103
00:04:42,146 --> 00:04:43,681
Well, I'm just saying...

104
00:04:43,682 --> 00:04:46,818
- Now it's a party.
- Ketamine or cheese?

105
00:04:46,819 --> 00:04:49,621
It's right here if you change your mind.
Oh, this is nice.

106
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:51,290
Where'd you get this?

107
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,724
Galaxy, that thrift store.

108
00:04:52,725 --> 00:04:54,860
- Oh, I love that place.
- Me too. I know.

109
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,561
Oh. Hi.

110
00:04:56,562 --> 00:04:58,263
- Hi, baby.
- What?

111
00:04:58,264 --> 00:05:01,232
- Come on. Come here.
- All right.

112
00:05:01,233 --> 00:05:02,900
My wife.

113
00:05:02,901 --> 00:05:04,137
- Hi.
- Hey.

114
00:05:06,137 --> 00:05:07,972
- How are you?
- Hi. I'm good.

115
00:05:07,973 --> 00:05:09,641
- Hi.
- Hi.

116
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:12,243
- Do you guys want wine?
- I do.

117
00:05:12,244 --> 00:05:13,247
Cheese? Ketamine?

118
00:05:15,247 --> 00:05:16,948
You look so good in leather.

119
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:19,717
Jesus Christ.

120
00:05:19,718 --> 00:05:21,561
- Um...
- I want water or something.

121
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:27,157
Did you know that, um,

122
00:05:27,158 --> 00:05:29,693
- Laurie is coming?
- There you go.

123
00:05:29,694 --> 00:05:32,196
No.

124
00:05:32,197 --> 00:05:33,830
- Laurie's coming?
- Yeah.

125
00:05:33,831 --> 00:05:35,700
Look at the smile on your face.

126
00:05:35,701 --> 00:05:38,503
- It's not a smile. It's not that smile.
- Oh. my God.

127
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:40,804
- Why is she coming tonight?
- Amir's bringing her.

128
00:05:40,805 --> 00:05:43,607
Beats me, because Amir's
a total jackass.

129
00:05:43,608 --> 00:05:44,809
Oh.

130
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:47,445
You know what? Put a quarter
into the swear jar.

131
00:05:47,446 --> 00:05:49,347
So, who did he tell?

132
00:05:49,348 --> 00:05:51,415
Well, we got the...
Yeah.

133
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:53,551
We got an e-mail about it.
Just his plus one.

134
00:05:53,552 --> 00:05:56,492
Plus one and then I
was, like, plus what?

135
00:06:01,492 --> 00:06:03,492
I need to know tonight?

136
00:06:03,795 --> 00:06:07,364
My editor needs to know how
to book hotels and flights.

137
00:06:07,365 --> 00:06:09,904
I gotta do it.
Let them know.

138
00:06:11,904 --> 00:06:13,709
Gotta know tonight.

139
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:18,677
You know I-I...
I can't...

140
00:06:18,678 --> 00:06:20,345
I-I just need
to think about it...

141
00:06:20,346 --> 00:06:22,179
a little bit longer because...

142
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,881
I just don't want to
make the wrong choice.

143
00:06:23,882 --> 00:06:25,450
What if you came
for a shorter time?

144
00:06:25,451 --> 00:06:28,662
Like a month, not the full four months.
Just come for a month.

145
00:06:29,244 --> 00:06:30,823
It's still a very long time...

146
00:06:31,023 --> 00:06:32,590
and I'm not saying no.

147
00:06:32,591 --> 00:06:36,963
Babe, if you don't say yes,
it becomes a no.

148
00:06:39,663 --> 00:06:41,933
We're cold and hungry.

149
00:06:41,934 --> 00:06:43,900
Hello?

150
00:06:43,901 --> 00:06:45,703
- Hello.
- Hi.

151
00:06:45,704 --> 00:06:48,439
- Amir, you look great.
- Thank you.

152
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,141
- Hi.
- You remember Laurie?

153
00:06:50,142 --> 00:06:51,669
Amir told me I wouldn't be...

154
00:06:51,869 --> 00:06:54,278
- overdressed, now I'm feeling...
- No. No, no.

155
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:56,583
We're underdressed.

156
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,383
- Hi.
- Hi.

157
00:06:59,384 --> 00:07:00,917
- How are you?
- I'm good.

158
00:07:00,918 --> 00:07:02,754
- Beth, do you remember Laurie?
- Yes.

159
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:05,422
- Nice to see you.
- You guys already said hello and...

160
00:07:05,423 --> 00:07:07,090
How are you?
Good to see you.

161
00:07:07,091 --> 00:07:09,393
You guys want red wine?

162
00:07:09,394 --> 00:07:11,963
Yes. I would
love red wine.

163
00:07:11,964 --> 00:07:14,431
- Lee?
- I've been cooking. I've been cooking.

164
00:07:14,432 --> 00:07:17,135
- How have you been?
- I've been good. I've been really good.

165
00:07:17,136 --> 00:07:19,203
- You?
- I've been great.

166
00:07:19,204 --> 00:07:22,773
Yeah. Life is looking very different
from how it was a while back.

167
00:07:22,774 --> 00:07:25,477
- In a good way, so...
- Well, cool. That's good to hear.

168
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:28,348
- I would hope so. There you go.
- Thank you.

169
00:07:30,348 --> 00:07:32,116
Not A, C, E.

170
00:07:32,117 --> 00:07:33,751
"Horace, listen.

171
00:07:33,752 --> 00:07:36,453
I'll be down at the pyramid.
Come on down and join.

172
00:07:36,454 --> 00:07:38,523
We gotta talk
about some deity stuff."

173
00:07:38,524 --> 00:07:40,624
Does everyone else
still not have service?

174
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:43,294
My phone is completely broken.

175
00:07:43,295 --> 00:07:46,564
I'm living in the moment, but...

176
00:07:46,565 --> 00:07:48,833
- Nothing.
- I got zero.

177
00:07:48,834 --> 00:07:51,568
That's weird.
Maybe the tower's down.

178
00:07:51,569 --> 00:07:53,604
The tower's down?

179
00:07:53,605 --> 00:07:55,707
I'm telling you guys...

180
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:57,674
- It's not down.
- That would be a big news story.

181
00:07:57,675 --> 00:08:00,744
Comet. Comet.

182
00:08:00,745 --> 00:08:03,748
- Miller's Comet.
- Yes. Thank you.

183
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:08,352
I read something this morning
about a comet in the 1930s.

184
00:08:08,353 --> 00:08:09,888
It was in Finland.

185
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:11,722
- Knocked out all of the...
- I actually...

186
00:08:11,723 --> 00:08:14,191
the cell towers?

187
00:08:14,192 --> 00:08:17,561
Actually, it was in 1923.

188
00:08:17,562 --> 00:08:19,229
And, yes, it was in Finland.

189
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:22,833
- Um...
- Thank you, Wikipedia.

190
00:08:22,834 --> 00:08:25,602
It was actually crazy,
because it affected the people.

191
00:08:25,603 --> 00:08:28,007
After it passed,
they would get lost.

192
00:08:28,607 --> 00:08:31,208
They would end up in the wrong home.
They would forget things.

193
00:08:31,209 --> 00:08:33,278
They wouldn't really
know where they were.

194
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,912
And I remember reading
about this one woman...

195
00:08:35,913 --> 00:08:38,516
who called the police and said,

196
00:08:38,517 --> 00:08:40,586
"The man in my house
is not my husband."

197
00:08:41,379 --> 00:08:42,853
And then police came over...

198
00:08:43,053 --> 00:08:45,656
and they said, "This
is your husband,"

199
00:08:45,657 --> 00:08:47,258
And she said, "No. This
is not my husband.

200
00:08:47,259 --> 00:08:49,560
- I killed my husband yesterday.
- Awesome.

201
00:08:49,561 --> 00:08:51,262
That's how I know
it's not him."

202
00:08:51,263 --> 00:08:53,898
But they couldn't arrest her,
because he was standing...

203
00:08:53,899 --> 00:08:55,633
right there in front in them.

204
00:08:55,634 --> 00:08:57,701
Do they have
any theories of why?

205
00:08:57,702 --> 00:09:00,937
Think how lucky she is. She
gets to kill him again.

206
00:09:00,938 --> 00:09:02,572
Clearly she wants
to kill this man.

207
00:09:02,573 --> 00:09:04,175
- It's just the Finnish.
- The Finns.

208
00:09:04,176 --> 00:09:06,109
The Finns or Finnish?

209
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:08,646
- You guys remember Halley's Comet?
- Yes.

210
00:09:08,647 --> 00:09:10,315
I mean, it was such a big deal.

211
00:09:10,316 --> 00:09:13,984
I remember at my school, we all had
to, like, reenact Halley's Comet.

212
00:09:13,985 --> 00:09:17,888
So, they assigned each of us
something celestial to do.

213
00:09:17,889 --> 00:09:20,358
My sister got to be Halley's Comet.
I was very jealous.

214
00:09:20,359 --> 00:09:23,094
I've never met your sister.
Have you guys met her sister?

215
00:09:23,095 --> 00:09:25,430
There's a picture of her right
over there on the mantel, but...

216
00:09:25,431 --> 00:09:27,898
- She's only a fleeting comet.
- she looks a little ridiculous.

217
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:29,700
- That's your sister?
- But why did you put it...

218
00:09:29,701 --> 00:09:31,402
It's the door to nowhere.

219
00:09:31,403 --> 00:09:33,238
In feng shui, a useless door,

220
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:34,839
which this is obviously
a useless door,

221
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:36,874
you put a picture of someone...

222
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:38,743
you have unresolved
issues with...

223
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:40,846
and it causes all
of this weird energy flow.

224
00:09:41,046 --> 00:09:42,979
I don't even like
being over here.

225
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:45,749
- It's freaky.
- You shouldn't be over there then.

226
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,317
- Every time you're...
- I'm sort of an empath.

227
00:09:47,318 --> 00:09:50,476
- Sort of an empath.
- And I can feel it. It's like a vortex.

228
00:09:50,955 --> 00:09:53,691
When was the last time we
were all together like this?

229
00:09:53,692 --> 00:09:55,826
I was thinking, right
before Thanksgiving,

230
00:09:55,827 --> 00:09:58,930
most of us were there, but
not everybody could be.

231
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:00,564
I don't think Laurie...
Laura?

232
00:10:00,565 --> 00:10:02,100
- Laurie.
- Laurie.

233
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:04,100
Sorry. We're gonna tell
all these stories.

234
00:10:04,101 --> 00:10:05,903
We do that when we get together.

235
00:10:05,904 --> 00:10:08,071
So Laurie, what are
you doing these days?

236
00:10:08,072 --> 00:10:10,240
- Well, I'm...
- Keeping yourself busy?

237
00:10:10,241 --> 00:10:11,742
I'm keeping busy.

238
00:10:11,743 --> 00:10:13,911
I'm actually working with some
outreach programs in Silicon Valley.

239
00:10:13,912 --> 00:10:15,281
We work with
at-risk youth.

240
00:10:16,014 --> 00:10:18,715
Oh, wow. Didn't you...
No, no, no.

241
00:10:18,716 --> 00:10:20,719
Are you still teaching the yoga?

242
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,887
The Spanish Yoga?
The Spoga?

243
00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:25,489
- No. Not me.
- Are you sure that...

244
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:27,157
Oh, that must've
been another girl...

245
00:10:27,158 --> 00:10:30,461
that Kevin dated that
Amir is hooking up with.

246
00:10:30,462 --> 00:10:32,864
Wow.
Let's give him a shovel.

247
00:10:32,865 --> 00:10:34,965
What are you doing? What
do you do for a living?

248
00:10:34,966 --> 00:10:37,902
I act.
Shut up, guys.

249
00:10:37,903 --> 00:10:39,802
I didn't remember
you were an actor.

250
00:10:39,803 --> 00:10:42,705
- So, you do mainly theater?
- Well, I did.

251
00:10:42,706 --> 00:10:47,345
Since I moved down here to support
my wife and her Skyping career.

252
00:10:47,346 --> 00:10:51,816
Um, but, no, I was in a TV
show for about four years.

253
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:53,683
<i>- Yeah? What was that?
- It was called Roswell.</i>

254
00:10:53,684 --> 00:10:55,552
<i>Oh, my God.
I love Roswell.</i>

255
00:10:55,553 --> 00:10:58,623
<i>When were you on Roswell?
What episodes were you on?</i>

256
00:10:58,624 --> 00:11:01,359
I was on all shows.
Produced.

257
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,827
- What do you mean?
- I was a series regular on that show.

258
00:11:03,828 --> 00:11:05,463
Yeah, he was,
like, the main guy.

259
00:11:05,464 --> 00:11:06,965
What character did you play?

260
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:10,567
- Joe.
- Did you have different hair, or something?

261
00:11:10,568 --> 00:11:12,135
I had the same exact hair.

262
00:11:12,136 --> 00:11:15,071
I'm sorry. Maybe it's one of
those things where you know...

263
00:11:15,072 --> 00:11:18,175
the character for so long, then you see
someone in person. It just doesn't compute.

264
00:11:18,176 --> 00:11:19,543
I don't know.

265
00:11:19,544 --> 00:11:24,250
- He's sort of grown into his face.
- You really have.

266
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:26,816
Check it out again.

267
00:11:26,817 --> 00:11:29,920
I'm sure, you know, like the downward
dog probably gets to your head.

268
00:11:29,921 --> 00:11:32,190
- I didn't do yoga. That wasn't...
- Well, hey, listen.

269
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:34,591
Thanks for enjoying the show.

270
00:11:34,592 --> 00:11:37,095
I think you are
a really good actor...

271
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:38,729
and I think you should
continue doing it.

272
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:41,932
- Thank you very much.
- I think it would be well worth your time.

273
00:11:41,933 --> 00:11:43,701
What are you up to these days?

274
00:11:43,702 --> 00:11:45,603
Last I remember, you were, like,

275
00:11:45,604 --> 00:11:47,937
taking the dance world by storm.

276
00:11:47,938 --> 00:11:49,974
Um, I guess the last time
I saw you...

277
00:11:49,975 --> 00:11:52,610
must've been when I was
creating the dance show.

278
00:11:53,846 --> 00:11:57,080
It was going really,
really well for a while,

279
00:11:57,081 --> 00:12:00,651
but then, right before
the, um... the premiere,

280
00:12:00,652 --> 00:12:03,220
they brought in
Svetlana Aserrano...

281
00:12:03,221 --> 00:12:07,258
<i>who is the best dancer
in the world really,</i>

282
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:09,326
and they just offered me
the understudy.

283
00:12:09,327 --> 00:12:11,128
She should've been
the whole thing.

284
00:12:11,129 --> 00:12:12,863
She created it.
She should be...

285
00:12:12,864 --> 00:12:15,357
- the prima ballerina of the San Francisco Ballet.
- That's terrible.

286
00:12:15,557 --> 00:12:17,502
You know, you hear these
stories sometimes...

287
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:20,738
about people being shut out
of things they created...

288
00:12:20,739 --> 00:12:23,340
and I think it's horrible.
I'm sorry.

289
00:12:23,341 --> 00:12:27,512
But I mean it's a good lesson
that I had to learn, because...

290
00:12:27,513 --> 00:12:29,947
You know, because of my pride,
I didn't want...

291
00:12:29,948 --> 00:12:32,082
to take the understudy
and I took too long...

292
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:36,086
to think about it and then
I lost the understudy job.

293
00:12:36,087 --> 00:12:39,421
And they gave that to
Katherine Meriss and...

294
00:12:39,621 --> 00:12:40,758
And she sucks.

295
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:42,426
- She sucks.
- No, she's good, guys.

296
00:12:42,427 --> 00:12:44,295
Anyways, the reason
that she's really big now...

297
00:12:44,296 --> 00:12:46,196
is because she ended up
going up.

298
00:12:46,197 --> 00:12:47,864
Svetlana pulled out
last minute...

299
00:12:47,865 --> 00:12:51,538
and Katherine ended up
doing the show.

300
00:12:52,538 --> 00:12:54,638
- Katherine Meriss?
- Exactly.

301
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,639
As soon as you said that, I
thought, "Katherine Meriss...

302
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:59,375
that's pretty much the only
person in dance I'd know."

303
00:12:59,376 --> 00:13:01,311
Right. Well...

304
00:13:01,312 --> 00:13:05,215
So, she basically stole
your... your whole thing?

305
00:13:05,216 --> 00:13:08,885
Katherine Meriss has
your life, basically.

306
00:13:08,886 --> 00:13:11,656
- Career.
- You have your life.

307
00:13:11,657 --> 00:13:14,392
It's a shame that it happened. She
doesn't hold a candle to you.

308
00:13:14,393 --> 00:13:17,728
Then, here's to the life
that we do lead.

309
00:13:17,729 --> 00:13:19,296
- Yeah.
- Well said.

310
00:13:19,297 --> 00:13:21,800
- Here's to the comet.
- The comet. And the comet.

311
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,167
Anybody have a happier story?

312
00:13:24,168 --> 00:13:26,336
Kevin, tell a crazy story, first
one that comes in your head.

313
00:13:26,337 --> 00:13:28,839
No. All right.

314
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:31,776
Um...
Sorry.

315
00:13:31,777 --> 00:13:33,310
I was going out with Laurie.

316
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:35,979
We were drinking
way too much at a bar.

317
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:38,483
I passed out and I
started dreaming...

318
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:41,186
this big black bear...

319
00:13:41,187 --> 00:13:44,588
was up on its hind legs
sort of mauling me.

320
00:13:44,589 --> 00:13:47,325
Slowly. Tenderly.

321
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:48,861
Anyhow, we go to some party...

322
00:13:49,061 --> 00:13:50,994
in Santa Cruz
and as we walked in,

323
00:13:50,995 --> 00:13:53,364
this huge dog comes
running straight at me.

324
00:13:53,365 --> 00:13:55,899
Jumps up on its hind legs
and starts pawing me,

325
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:59,302
exactly like the dream,
and this guy yells,

326
00:13:59,303 --> 00:14:03,840
- "Bear, get down, Bear."
- What?

327
00:14:03,841 --> 00:14:06,409
Wow.
You have a gift.

328
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:08,546
The way you told
that story, I thought...

329
00:14:08,547 --> 00:14:10,547
somebody was going to die.

330
00:14:10,548 --> 00:14:13,550
You know Bear is
the most common dog name.

331
00:14:13,551 --> 00:14:16,489
Oh, that makes it a much
less interesting story.

332
00:14:17,489 --> 00:14:19,123
Thanks for that, Lee.

333
00:14:19,124 --> 00:14:21,461
Most common bear name?
Henry.

334
00:14:23,461 --> 00:14:26,297
- Look.
- Oh, my God.

335
00:14:26,298 --> 00:14:28,432
- What?
- This is like your phone.

336
00:14:28,433 --> 00:14:30,533
Oh, my God. That happened
to my phone tonight.

337
00:14:30,534 --> 00:14:33,104
And I was just holding
mine in my hand.

338
00:14:33,105 --> 00:14:35,505
- Exact same thing.
- Shattered?

339
00:14:35,506 --> 00:14:37,841
Yeah. This is what they were
talking about on the news.

340
00:14:37,842 --> 00:14:39,643
Yeah. Yeah.
It must be the comet.

341
00:14:39,644 --> 00:14:41,847
- The chicken tastes like tuna.
- All right.

342
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:43,783
It must be Miller's Comet.

343
00:14:44,783 --> 00:14:46,550
So, nobody's phone works?

344
00:14:46,551 --> 00:14:48,484
I haven't checked mine,
but I assume it doesn't.

345
00:14:48,485 --> 00:14:50,387
Everyone else's
is in the other room.

346
00:14:50,388 --> 00:14:53,927
- Do you guys have a landline?
- No. We're wireless, baby.

347
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:59,297
All right. I need to get
ahold of my brother.

348
00:14:59,298 --> 00:15:01,898
- What about, um, your deal...
- The computer.

349
00:15:01,899 --> 00:15:03,399
- Good idea.
- It's in the office.

350
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,134
- Could I?
- Yeah, yeah. Thanks.

351
00:15:05,135 --> 00:15:07,437
- What's wrong with your brother?
- Nothing. He's fine.

352
00:15:07,438 --> 00:15:10,807
He just, um...
You know Brian.

353
00:15:10,808 --> 00:15:13,509
He hangs out with all those, you
know, theoretical physicists.

354
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:15,946
- No Internet.
- No?

355
00:15:15,947 --> 00:15:17,848
- On the computer.
- How is there no Internet?

356
00:15:18,048 --> 00:15:20,917
- You run Skype. You tell us.
- I know.

357
00:15:20,918 --> 00:15:23,586
What are they saying
about the comet?

358
00:15:23,587 --> 00:15:26,956
Nothing... Nothing
to get upset about.

359
00:15:26,957 --> 00:15:29,393
He just said to give him a call,

360
00:15:29,394 --> 00:15:31,396
you know, if there was
anything weird going on.

361
00:15:31,397 --> 00:15:33,230
Like, why? What did
he think it could do?

362
00:15:33,231 --> 00:15:34,865
Why didn't you tell me this?

363
00:15:34,866 --> 00:15:36,433
Because of your feng shui...

364
00:15:36,434 --> 00:15:38,902
- and granola candles, and I didn't want to...
- Stop making fun of me.

365
00:15:38,903 --> 00:15:40,403
I'm not making fun of you.

366
00:15:40,404 --> 00:15:41,839
There's a massive
celestial object,

367
00:15:42,039 --> 00:15:43,540
and I didn't
want to freak you out.

368
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:45,142
- Now you're freaking me out.
- You guys realize...

369
00:15:45,143 --> 00:15:46,610
<i>I was on a show
called Roswell...</i>

370
00:15:46,611 --> 00:15:49,180
and we tackled these issues
every week.

371
00:15:49,181 --> 00:15:51,181
That's true.

372
00:15:51,749 --> 00:15:53,617
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, my God.

373
00:15:53,618 --> 00:15:55,585
- Honey.
- Um, I'm on it.

374
00:15:55,586 --> 00:15:57,186
Do we have candles?

375
00:15:57,187 --> 00:15:58,690
I'm so glad I'm not high.

376
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:02,258
I don't want to sit
by the door to nowhere.

377
00:16:02,259 --> 00:16:05,863
Mike, check the breakers.

378
00:16:05,864 --> 00:16:08,298
I'm going to turn the lighter
on then come to you.

379
00:16:08,299 --> 00:16:11,167
- You guys need help?
- No. I have matches.

380
00:16:11,168 --> 00:16:13,838
- Candle power?
- I've got some over here.

381
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:17,340
I got blue glowsticks, red
glowsticks and green glowsticks.

382
00:16:17,341 --> 00:16:20,109
Guys, let's just
light candles and...

383
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:22,079
Oh.

384
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,181
- Hey.
- Everybody rave.

385
00:16:24,182 --> 00:16:26,117
- Are you going outside?
- Yeah.

386
00:16:26,118 --> 00:16:27,618
What do you mean,
you're going outside?

387
00:16:27,619 --> 00:16:30,672
I'm gonna see if the power's
off in the whole neighborhood.

388
00:16:36,227 --> 00:16:38,029
I decided this is
where mine goes.

389
00:16:39,029 --> 00:16:40,898
Well, this is a little strange,

390
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:42,766
but the whole
neighborhood is out...

391
00:16:42,767 --> 00:16:45,768
of power, except for a house
about two blocks up,

392
00:16:45,769 --> 00:16:47,271
which is completely lit up.

393
00:16:47,272 --> 00:16:49,005
It's kind of
beautiful, actually.

394
00:16:49,006 --> 00:16:51,742
- The house?
- I want to go see.

395
00:16:51,743 --> 00:16:55,479
- Let's go check it out.
- I've never seen it so dark outside before.

396
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,748
- You can't leave me. I'm gonna go.
- Come on then.

397
00:16:57,749 --> 00:16:59,215
Don't leave me by myself.

398
00:16:59,216 --> 00:17:02,319
- Where?
- You don't see it?

399
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,922
- It's right there.
- Why are you so far ahead of everyone?

400
00:17:04,923 --> 00:17:06,958
Amir, dude, I can't see you.

401
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,992
- Let Laurie go first.
- Thanks a lot.

402
00:17:08,993 --> 00:17:11,996
- That's sweet.
- Baby. Don't go.

403
00:17:11,997 --> 00:17:13,963
- Come here.
- See? Look.

404
00:17:13,964 --> 00:17:16,037
- Everything done.
- Come here.

405
00:17:19,037 --> 00:17:20,538
See that?

406
00:17:21,538 --> 00:17:23,908
- Two blocks down.
- Oh, they have light.

407
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:26,710
- That one house has light.
- They must have a...

408
00:17:26,711 --> 00:17:28,345
- A generator, or something?
- Yeah, yeah.

409
00:17:28,346 --> 00:17:29,979
What is that, two blocks away?

410
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:31,481
Could solar power do that?

411
00:17:31,482 --> 00:17:33,883
But would their landline
be working?

412
00:17:33,884 --> 00:17:35,352
Oh, wow.
Look at that.

413
00:17:35,353 --> 00:17:38,756
- Oh, wow.
- It's magnificent.

414
00:17:38,757 --> 00:17:40,194
Holy moly.

415
00:17:44,194 --> 00:17:45,729
Well, I'm freezing.

416
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:47,431
Should we head over
there, or should we...

417
00:17:47,432 --> 00:17:49,538
- No.
- Maybe we should head back inside.

418
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:54,739
That was awesome, right?

419
00:17:56,634 --> 00:17:59,108
- I didn't even see this get knocked over.
- No.

420
00:17:59,109 --> 00:18:00,912
I didn't even know
that glass was out here.

421
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:02,479
I never go down
into the basement.

422
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,449
Guys, listen. Seriously,
what's up with that house?

423
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:07,183
- Why are they...?
- What?

424
00:18:07,184 --> 00:18:08,751
It could be a generator.

425
00:18:08,752 --> 00:18:09,654
Really?

426
00:18:09,655 --> 00:18:12,255
I don't know. Maybe they're
just off-the-grid bastard...

427
00:18:12,256 --> 00:18:13,790
Well, apparently,
we have a generator.

428
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:15,726
That would make sense if
they were off the grid.

429
00:18:15,727 --> 00:18:19,829
I'm actually thinking of...
of going over there.

430
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:21,464
What?

431
00:18:21,465 --> 00:18:24,101
- No, you're not going over there.
- Honey, it's okay.

432
00:18:24,102 --> 00:18:26,569
- It's o...
- It's ridiculous.

433
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:29,105
It's not that far.
Look, look, look, look.

434
00:18:29,106 --> 00:18:31,540
My brother, he says...

435
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:35,245
he said that if... if anything
strange were to happen...

436
00:18:35,246 --> 00:18:37,614
while the comet
was passing over...

437
00:18:37,615 --> 00:18:40,951
- that we should stay inside.
- What?

438
00:18:40,952 --> 00:18:42,653
Just hold on, Amir.

439
00:18:42,654 --> 00:18:46,289
That we should stay inside and that
I should do my best to contact him.

440
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:47,790
And so that's all
that I'm doing.

441
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:51,962
He said if anything strange
should happen? I mean...

442
00:18:51,963 --> 00:18:54,765
I'm not the only one who
thinks this is strange.

443
00:18:54,766 --> 00:18:56,700
- What is weird?
- Didn't he say to stay inside though?

444
00:18:56,701 --> 00:18:58,768
What's more important
than the other?

445
00:18:58,769 --> 00:19:01,672
Yes, but this overrides that,
and it's only two blocks away.

446
00:19:01,673 --> 00:19:03,874
I'll be back
in, like, five minutes.

447
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:06,643
- Well, then you can't go by yourself.
- I'm going with him.

448
00:19:06,644 --> 00:19:09,313
There you go.
I'll take Amir.

449
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:11,681
- I'm the least important person here.
- This is true.

450
00:19:11,682 --> 00:19:13,416
It's about time you
started realizing that.

451
00:19:13,417 --> 00:19:16,153
- Just stay here.
- Why are you going now?

452
00:19:16,154 --> 00:19:18,655
Well, bring your glowsticks
so we can identify your bodies.

453
00:19:18,656 --> 00:19:20,709
- Good idea.
- Thanks. That helps a lot.

454
00:19:21,093 --> 00:19:23,093
- Don't listen to them.
- That's great.

455
00:19:23,094 --> 00:19:24,595
Five minutes, all right?

456
00:19:24,596 --> 00:19:26,329
- Okay. Five minutes.
- All right. Okay.

457
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:28,132
Beth, I-I couldn't
find my shoes.

458
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:29,600
I'm borrowing yours.
I'm sorry.

459
00:19:29,601 --> 00:19:31,238
That's so Amir.

460
00:19:33,238 --> 00:19:36,374
- Ten minutes we give them.
- They will be fine.

461
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:39,543
We're just rattled because we're
addicted to cell phones and Internet.

462
00:19:39,544 --> 00:19:41,778
We are. What did we do
before cell phones?

463
00:19:41,779 --> 00:19:45,249
Em, you seem to be the
comet expert here tonight.

464
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,816
What happened the last time?

465
00:19:46,817 --> 00:19:49,786
This one passed over a hundred
years ago, but much farther.

466
00:19:49,787 --> 00:19:52,189
But do we know that
anything happened?

467
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:54,591
Nothing happened then.
It was too far away.

468
00:19:54,592 --> 00:19:56,293
So, is there any reason...

469
00:19:56,294 --> 00:19:57,795
we should be
freaked out right now?

470
00:19:57,796 --> 00:20:01,264
Well, I mean, it is
a lot closer this time.

471
00:20:01,265 --> 00:20:03,166
What does that mean?

472
00:20:03,167 --> 00:20:04,589
Okay. I read
one more thing.

473
00:20:05,002 --> 00:20:07,771
- Oh, another story.
- Just one more.

474
00:20:07,772 --> 00:20:09,538
It's called
the Tunguska Event...

475
00:20:09,539 --> 00:20:12,576
and, um, it was a comet...

476
00:20:12,577 --> 00:20:14,478
or a meteor
or something like that...

477
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:17,146
that entered the
atmosphere over Siberia...

478
00:20:17,147 --> 00:20:19,983
and exploded over Earth.

479
00:20:19,984 --> 00:20:22,486
So, it didn't actually
have physical impact.

480
00:20:22,487 --> 00:20:24,421
It didn't touch Earth.

481
00:20:24,422 --> 00:20:25,862
It didn't leave
a crater or anything,

482
00:20:26,057 --> 00:20:28,491
but the force
of that explosion...

483
00:20:28,492 --> 00:20:32,296
flattened trees
for hundreds of miles.

484
00:20:32,297 --> 00:20:35,565
But it only killed
about one to two people.

485
00:20:35,566 --> 00:20:38,501
It's Siberia. There were
probably only two people there.

486
00:20:38,502 --> 00:20:40,103
Yeah, but they don't
necessarily...

487
00:20:40,104 --> 00:20:42,572
- It wiped out the population of Siberia.
- Basically. Yeah.

488
00:20:42,573 --> 00:20:44,307
- Right.
- Well, that doesn't make me feel better.

489
00:20:44,308 --> 00:20:46,143
And when was this?

490
00:20:46,144 --> 00:20:48,279
It was, like, in 1908, 1903...

491
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:52,716
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God. What is...

492
00:20:52,717 --> 00:20:56,220
- What the fuck was that?
- I don't know.

493
00:20:56,221 --> 00:20:58,256
- Lock that front door.
- Don't open the door.

494
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:00,356
- I'm gonna get the bat.
- Yeah. Give me the bat.

495
00:21:00,357 --> 00:21:01,991
Mike, is that door locked?

496
00:21:01,992 --> 00:21:04,094
- I'll check it.
- Babe, stay away from the door.

497
00:21:04,095 --> 00:21:05,729
- You need the stick?
- Thank you.

498
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:07,230
No, no, no.

499
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:12,010
- I just want to see what the hell is out there.
- Oh, my God.

500
00:21:12,502 --> 00:21:13,871
- Don't open it.
- Oh, God.

501
00:21:15,006 --> 00:21:16,809
Please, don't open that.

502
00:21:18,524 --> 00:21:21,577
- Is anybody there?
- Front door's locked. There's nothing.

503
00:21:21,578 --> 00:21:23,314
There's nothing out there.

504
00:21:23,315 --> 00:21:25,114
Thought I was going
to have a heart attack.

505
00:21:25,115 --> 00:21:26,950
Everybody all right?

506
00:21:26,951 --> 00:21:29,920
Check the generator, please.
Please try the generator.

507
00:21:29,921 --> 00:21:31,756
- I'll check the generator.
- Would the guys do that?

508
00:21:31,757 --> 00:21:33,757
No. The guys would not
do anything like that.

509
00:21:33,758 --> 00:21:35,459
They're not stupid.
They wouldn't do that.

510
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,126
- How long have they been gone?
- Like ten minutes.

511
00:21:37,127 --> 00:21:39,829
Five minutes out, five minutes back.
They should be back by now.

512
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:41,565
So, they should be back by now.

513
00:21:41,566 --> 00:21:44,067
- Okay. I think we should go get them.
- No, no, no.

514
00:21:44,068 --> 00:21:45,568
I want to go get my husband.

515
00:21:45,569 --> 00:21:47,470
We need to do it together
this time, guys.

516
00:21:47,471 --> 00:21:49,206
That's fine with me.
I just want to go.

517
00:21:49,207 --> 00:21:52,476
- Don't go outside.
- I'm not going anywhere. I'm just...

518
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:56,281
We should go get them.
We can all go together.

519
00:21:57,281 --> 00:22:00,351
Okay, all right.
This is good.

520
00:22:00,352 --> 00:22:02,786
Is that the grid
or the generator?

521
00:22:02,787 --> 00:22:04,721
No, it's just us.
He must have gotten it going.

522
00:22:04,722 --> 00:22:06,257
There's no other lights on?
It's just us?

523
00:22:06,258 --> 00:22:09,680
- It's pitch black out there. At least it's on.
- So it must be...

524
00:22:10,494 --> 00:22:12,194
- Well done.
- Thank you.

525
00:22:12,195 --> 00:22:14,664
- You did it.
- Let there be light.

526
00:22:14,665 --> 00:22:17,933
Okay. Well, I think
that we should...

527
00:22:17,934 --> 00:22:20,837
As a group, we should
go find those guys.

528
00:22:20,838 --> 00:22:23,973
- I agree.
- Let's do it as a group this time.

529
00:22:23,974 --> 00:22:25,709
No. That's
ridiculous.

530
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:27,743
If you get lost in the
woods, you're supposed...

531
00:22:27,744 --> 00:22:29,712
to stay where you are until
someone can find you.

532
00:22:29,713 --> 00:22:32,115
Fine. That's great. Let's
just sit down and breathe.

533
00:22:32,116 --> 00:22:35,553
For once, I actually agree
with what you're saying.

534
00:22:35,554 --> 00:22:37,820
You know what? You've been
giving me shit all night.

535
00:22:37,821 --> 00:22:40,626
- I am agreeing with you.
- Guys, guys, guys.

536
00:22:42,626 --> 00:22:44,428
I don't like any of this.

537
00:22:44,429 --> 00:22:47,199
Jesus!

538
00:22:48,199 --> 00:22:49,866
Stay.

539
00:22:49,867 --> 00:22:51,070
Oh, my God.

540
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:54,441
Oh man, it's them.

541
00:22:56,303 --> 00:22:58,409
- What the hell happened?
- Are you okay?

542
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:01,012
- I'm fine, I'm fine.
- Are you okay?

543
00:23:02,012 --> 00:23:03,480
What is this?

544
00:23:05,215 --> 00:23:08,250
- What's the box?
- That was at the other house.

545
00:23:08,251 --> 00:23:09,787
I thought I saw Hugh
put it down.

546
00:23:09,788 --> 00:23:11,621
Then he was running
around the corner and...

547
00:23:11,622 --> 00:23:13,757
- You just took it?
- I just followed him.

548
00:23:13,758 --> 00:23:15,925
- I didn't... I had it in my hand.
- Why was he running?

549
00:23:15,926 --> 00:23:18,461
- Hugh, what happened?
- I'm fine, I'm fine.

550
00:23:18,462 --> 00:23:21,998
- Did you put this down?
- Amir, why the fuck did you take that?

551
00:23:21,999 --> 00:23:24,800
- I thought I saw you put it down.
- I did not touch that thing.

552
00:23:24,801 --> 00:23:27,237
I don't know what that is
or why you grabbed it.

553
00:23:27,238 --> 00:23:30,606
- Guys, what happened?
- Okay. We were at the other house.

554
00:23:30,607 --> 00:23:33,210
Hugh went around the side.
I thought I heard a noise.

555
00:23:33,211 --> 00:23:35,812
You made some kind of sound, and
then you saw what? Something.

556
00:23:35,813 --> 00:23:37,347
You won't tell me what you saw.

557
00:23:37,348 --> 00:23:40,483
I don't understand what's going on.
What did you see?

558
00:23:40,484 --> 00:23:41,985
- I don't...
- What did you see?

559
00:23:41,986 --> 00:23:43,653
That has nothing to do
with anything...

560
00:23:43,654 --> 00:23:45,255
that we should be
fucking concerned with.

561
00:23:45,256 --> 00:23:46,256
What did you see?

562
00:23:47,057 --> 00:23:50,293
- It's not a big deal. I'll walk it back.
- Okay, fine.

563
00:23:50,294 --> 00:23:51,929
Wait. Let me
open it first.

564
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:53,831
No, Mike.
What are you doing?

565
00:23:53,832 --> 00:23:56,799
- What is it?
- I don't know. I don't know.

566
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:59,335
You don't want to talk about it
and you don't want to open...

567
00:23:59,336 --> 00:24:02,471
Fine! Open the fucking box!
Open the box. What do I care?

568
00:24:02,472 --> 00:24:04,341
What is wrong?
Calm down.

569
00:24:04,342 --> 00:24:07,177
What happened?

570
00:24:07,178 --> 00:24:08,847
Holy shit, it worked.

571
00:24:09,847 --> 00:24:11,382
I got it.

572
00:24:11,383 --> 00:24:12,915
Open it away from your face.

573
00:24:12,916 --> 00:24:15,419
- It's not a bomb.
- How do you know what the heck it is?

574
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:18,092
- Don't freak out.
- Be careful.

575
00:24:21,092 --> 00:24:24,460
Oh, my God, It's a ping-pong paddle.
It's a ping-pong paddle.

576
00:24:24,461 --> 00:24:27,469
- Well, what's that?
- What is going on?

577
00:24:31,469 --> 00:24:34,336
- Oh, my God.
- What is it?

578
00:24:34,337 --> 00:24:37,210
These are pictures of all of us.

579
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:42,479
These are...

580
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,980
- Somebody's marked us.
- I want to try to figure this out.

581
00:24:44,981 --> 00:24:46,915
- This is insane.
- And there are numbers on the back.

582
00:24:46,916 --> 00:24:48,818
- Hugh.
- Baby, what did you see?

583
00:24:48,819 --> 00:24:50,653
- Hugh what did you see?
- What did you see?

584
00:24:50,654 --> 00:24:52,288
Jesus Christ, man.

585
00:24:52,289 --> 00:24:55,862
You can't stand there and not say anything!
What did you see?

586
00:24:57,862 --> 00:24:59,565
Hugh!

587
00:25:00,565 --> 00:25:03,100
There are pictures of us
in this box!

588
00:25:03,101 --> 00:25:04,944
Hugh!

589
00:25:13,944 --> 00:25:17,180
I went to the window,
and I looked in the window.

590
00:25:17,181 --> 00:25:19,615
And I saw a table...

591
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:23,519
with wine glasses and candles...

592
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:28,557
and dinner set for eight people.

593
00:25:28,558 --> 00:25:30,997
I saw...

594
00:25:32,997 --> 00:25:34,530
Oh, my God.

595
00:25:34,531 --> 00:25:36,633
Right.
Okay, fuck you, Hugh.

596
00:25:36,634 --> 00:25:38,302
- I saw...
- Bullshit.

597
00:25:38,303 --> 00:25:41,437
- Did you guys come and fuck with this door?
- Fuck you, Kevin.

598
00:25:41,438 --> 00:25:42,654
Did you come to the side door?

599
00:25:42,854 --> 00:25:44,841
No. You went to the side
door at the other house.

600
00:25:44,842 --> 00:25:46,610
They wouldn't answer
the door, so I went...

601
00:25:46,611 --> 00:25:48,111
Bullshit.

602
00:25:48,212 --> 00:25:51,160
You dipshits walked in a circle
and knocked on this door.

603
00:25:51,416 --> 00:25:53,936
I did not walk in a fucking circle!
I went two blocks.

604
00:25:54,018 --> 00:25:56,153
We went up to that house.
I knocked at the door.

605
00:25:56,154 --> 00:25:58,889
Nobody answered, so I went
and banged on the side door.

606
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:01,391
- Did you see yourself, Hugh?
- No, I did not see myself.

607
00:26:01,392 --> 00:26:04,498
- No, because you weren't there.
- I did not go in a circle!

608
00:26:05,362 --> 00:26:06,699
Fuck.
Just calm down.

609
00:26:07,699 --> 00:26:09,232
I don't believe this.

610
00:26:09,233 --> 00:26:10,834
This still doesn't
explain the pictures.

611
00:26:10,835 --> 00:26:12,501
What's on the back of them?

612
00:26:12,502 --> 00:26:14,504
Numbers.

613
00:26:14,505 --> 00:26:19,977
They're all...
We've got two, one, one.

614
00:26:19,978 --> 00:26:22,479
That's five.

615
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,515
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Where are you going?
- I'm gonna go back over there.

616
00:26:25,516 --> 00:26:28,485
- Whoa.
- No, no, no. Think about it.

617
00:26:28,486 --> 00:26:30,886
I'm gonna go back over there. I'm
gonna ask to use their phone...

618
00:26:30,887 --> 00:26:32,655
and, hopefully, I can get
in touch with my brother.

619
00:26:32,656 --> 00:26:34,544
And if they're not there,
I'll just leave a note. Right?

620
00:26:34,545 --> 00:26:35,525
No.

621
00:26:35,526 --> 00:26:36,926
No, no, no.
That makes sense. Right?

622
00:26:37,028 --> 00:26:39,496
You should not go back. It's fine.
It'll be fine.

623
00:26:39,497 --> 00:26:41,367
It'll be fucking fine.

624
00:26:44,367 --> 00:26:45,940
What's a note going to do?

625
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:54,544
If these people have pictures
of us, they might be crazy.

626
00:26:54,545 --> 00:26:55,944
Shit! There's someone out there.

627
00:26:55,945 --> 00:26:57,581
There's someone out there.

628
00:26:57,582 --> 00:27:00,083
- What?
- Oh, my God.

629
00:27:00,084 --> 00:27:01,884
Oh, there's a big
guy at the door.

630
00:27:01,885 --> 00:27:03,921
- Oh, my God.
- At the door?

631
00:27:03,922 --> 00:27:05,521
What should we do?

632
00:27:05,522 --> 00:27:07,124
He's walking away. He's walking away.
Please, please.

633
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:08,968
Baby, please be careful.
Oh, my God.

634
00:27:15,266 --> 00:27:16,767
- Baby.
- Careful.

635
00:27:16,768 --> 00:27:18,742
- Shit.
- What?

636
00:27:25,742 --> 00:27:28,146
What is it, babe?

637
00:27:30,146 --> 00:27:34,584
"Hey, there. Don't mean
to freak you guys out,

638
00:27:34,585 --> 00:27:39,189
but we just wanted to borrow your
phone for five minutes tops.

639
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:40,768
Thanks."

640
00:27:49,768 --> 00:27:51,601
Two kinds.

641
00:27:51,602 --> 00:27:53,538
Regular Band-Aid
or cloth?

642
00:27:55,538 --> 00:27:57,807
Whatever.

643
00:27:57,808 --> 00:28:00,612
Cloth. Okay. Here we go.

644
00:28:01,612 --> 00:28:04,314
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

645
00:28:04,315 --> 00:28:09,653
These are ones. This is a two.
We are four, five, six.

646
00:28:09,654 --> 00:28:11,688
Do you have any red markers?

647
00:28:11,689 --> 00:28:15,294
Okay. Why are
these three ones?

648
00:28:16,294 --> 00:28:19,162
- This is a six. Five.
- Hugh and Lee.

649
00:28:19,163 --> 00:28:20,163
Two.

650
00:28:22,099 --> 00:28:23,901
Four.

651
00:28:23,902 --> 00:28:25,835
And that's the same picture.

652
00:28:25,836 --> 00:28:28,473
Oh, my God.

653
00:28:30,473 --> 00:28:31,980
Somebody cut that in half.

654
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:37,086
Where are these from?

655
00:28:38,015 --> 00:28:40,916
Could this be like numerology?

656
00:28:40,917 --> 00:28:43,620
Like if you add up
all the numbers...

657
00:28:43,621 --> 00:28:45,322
in your name and the birthday...

658
00:28:45,323 --> 00:28:47,457
Like life path numbers
or something like that?

659
00:28:47,458 --> 00:28:49,992
If that's the case, then they're just
crazy and it doesn't matter anyway.

660
00:28:49,993 --> 00:28:52,161
So, what do all the ones
have in common?

661
00:28:52,162 --> 00:28:55,097
Um, we have Lee...
Date of birth?

662
00:28:55,098 --> 00:28:57,066
- Oldest to youngest?
- There's no three?

663
00:28:57,067 --> 00:28:59,335
- There's no three.
- There's no three.

664
00:28:59,336 --> 00:29:03,239
Is there someone... Is there
someone that would want to be...

665
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,807
doing this to us?

666
00:29:04,808 --> 00:29:08,111
Is there someone that
is on someone's bad side?

667
00:29:08,112 --> 00:29:10,048
What?
This was taken tonight.

668
00:29:11,048 --> 00:29:14,116
What?
How do you know that?

669
00:29:14,117 --> 00:29:18,023
I bought this sweater today,
so that's from tonight.

670
00:29:20,023 --> 00:29:22,661
Has anyone taken
a picture of you tonight?

671
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:26,129
Someone took a picture of you
when you were looking at the box.

672
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:27,931
You were looking into the lens.

673
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:30,333
But then it was
already in the box.

674
00:29:30,334 --> 00:29:33,502
What is that?

675
00:29:33,503 --> 00:29:34,838
I can't tell what that is.

676
00:29:35,038 --> 00:29:37,140
There's dots on the wall
and there's a lampshade.

677
00:29:37,141 --> 00:29:38,821
None of the others are from tonight.
Right?

678
00:29:39,009 --> 00:29:41,845
No. This our picture.
This is from last fall.

679
00:29:41,846 --> 00:29:44,413
- This picture of Amir was taken over here.
- How do you know that?

680
00:29:44,414 --> 00:29:46,649
- He's standing in front of this drum.
- Guys, hang on.

681
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:47,930
I can't figure out what this is.

682
00:29:48,051 --> 00:29:49,819
It's taken from the door?

683
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:51,220
So, from behind the curtain?

684
00:29:51,221 --> 00:29:52,756
It's taken from over there.

685
00:29:52,757 --> 00:29:55,424
Wait. When someone knocked
on the door, were you there?

686
00:29:55,425 --> 00:29:57,192
You were gone.

687
00:29:57,193 --> 00:29:59,397
But you're looking
right at the camera.

688
00:30:01,397 --> 00:30:05,268
So, it would be from that door, then.
Right?

689
00:30:05,269 --> 00:30:06,743
You don't remember...
I mean,

690
00:30:07,038 --> 00:30:09,839
this is you, man.
This is you.

691
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,443
Guys, this isn't going
to solve anything.

692
00:30:13,443 --> 00:30:14,978
What're you doing?

693
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:17,579
I need a drink.
I need something.

694
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:19,449
The... The pictures?

695
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:21,392
All right.
Me too.

696
00:30:28,392 --> 00:30:30,727
It looks like
my handwriting, babe.

697
00:30:30,728 --> 00:30:32,734
Look at this.

698
00:30:37,734 --> 00:30:39,768
It looks like I wrote this.

699
00:30:39,769 --> 00:30:41,770
Okay, relax.

700
00:30:41,771 --> 00:30:44,707
You're starting to freak me out.

701
00:30:44,708 --> 00:30:46,948
That's your handwriting.

702
00:30:50,948 --> 00:30:52,319
What is going on?

703
00:30:56,319 --> 00:30:58,496
I feel like I'm losing my mind.

704
00:31:05,422 --> 00:31:07,896
I can't stop thinking
about the fact that you...

705
00:31:07,897 --> 00:31:12,971
brought up a story
you shared with Laurie.

706
00:31:13,971 --> 00:31:17,073
Of all the stories
that you could've...

707
00:31:17,074 --> 00:31:19,208
All the experiences
that we've shared,

708
00:31:19,209 --> 00:31:20,943
you brought up
a story about her?

709
00:31:20,944 --> 00:31:23,246
- I am so sorry.
- In front of everyone.

710
00:31:23,247 --> 00:31:26,082
It's a crazy story. We don't
have stories like that.

711
00:31:26,083 --> 00:31:27,818
Oh, they're not
crazy enough for you.

712
00:31:28,018 --> 00:31:30,487
Baby, it's a good thing.
Oh, God.

713
00:31:30,488 --> 00:31:32,588
I don't need crazy stories
like that anymore.

714
00:31:32,589 --> 00:31:36,360
All right. Hey, um, fuck this.
Let's just... Let's go.

715
00:31:36,361 --> 00:31:38,161
I'm gonna go over there
and, theoretically,

716
00:31:38,162 --> 00:31:40,595
let's go see if our
theoretical selves are there.

717
00:31:40,596 --> 00:31:42,231
No, no, no.
I'm going.

718
00:31:42,232 --> 00:31:45,634
I'm in. There's some weird
stuff happening here.

719
00:31:45,635 --> 00:31:47,202
I think we should...

720
00:31:47,203 --> 00:31:48,671
- I think we should evaluate...
- Please, can we...

721
00:31:48,672 --> 00:31:50,640
- I just evaluated and I'm going.
- Can we stay here?

722
00:31:50,641 --> 00:31:53,175
- If there's another me, I want to see me.
- No. No way.

723
00:31:53,176 --> 00:31:54,911
- No, no.
- Let's go.

724
00:31:54,912 --> 00:31:56,412
- Look.
- I'm over this.

725
00:31:56,413 --> 00:31:58,248
I'm getting sick
of talking about it.

726
00:31:58,249 --> 00:31:59,749
I'm getting sick
of writing about it.

727
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:02,451
- The same fucking paper, the pictures...
- Wait.

728
00:32:02,452 --> 00:32:04,488
There's nobody
trying to hurt us.

729
00:32:04,489 --> 00:32:06,622
We go find out what
the hell is going on.

730
00:32:06,623 --> 00:32:09,558
What about you? You were
the one who wanted to go.

731
00:32:09,559 --> 00:32:12,428
That's when I thought
they might have a phone.

732
00:32:12,429 --> 00:32:16,665
Four glowsticks. Can we
please keep two guys here?

733
00:32:16,666 --> 00:32:19,068
- Two guys staying here? Please?
- I'm staying, I'm staying.

734
00:32:19,069 --> 00:32:21,438
Are you going?
Amir, please.

735
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:23,172
Let's go.

736
00:32:23,173 --> 00:32:24,807
So, what? We're
splitting up again?

737
00:32:24,808 --> 00:32:26,375
No. We're not
splitting up.

738
00:32:26,376 --> 00:32:29,144
We're just gonna go in two
different groups. Oh. Okay.

739
00:32:29,145 --> 00:32:30,356
Sticks, sticks, sticks.

740
00:32:31,048 --> 00:32:32,749
Do we need a towel on it?

741
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:34,983
I'm coming.
Wait.

742
00:32:34,984 --> 00:32:37,185
Chill for a second.
I'm coming.

743
00:32:37,186 --> 00:32:38,713
- Why?
- Because I want to go.

744
00:32:39,056 --> 00:32:40,394
I'm going with Kevin.

745
00:32:44,394 --> 00:32:47,130
- Give us 20 minutes.
- All right.

746
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:49,632
- And then what?
- Are we taking the bat?

747
00:32:49,633 --> 00:32:52,268
No. We'll be fine. You will be fine.
It's gonna be all right.

748
00:32:52,269 --> 00:32:54,047
We'll find out what's going on.

749
00:33:03,047 --> 00:33:06,202
No cars. No people.
There's nothing.

750
00:33:26,202 --> 00:33:27,202
Guys, look.

751
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:31,410
That's my house.

752
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:35,682
Mike.
This is my house.

753
00:33:38,682 --> 00:33:40,483
Mike, this isn't right.

754
00:33:40,484 --> 00:33:42,951
Mike, this is not your house.

755
00:33:42,952 --> 00:33:44,758
Mike.

756
00:33:46,758 --> 00:33:48,991
- My house.
- This is not your house, Mike.

757
00:33:48,992 --> 00:33:52,194
Mike.
This is not your house.

758
00:33:52,195 --> 00:33:55,000
What is he doing?
Kevin.

759
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,705
I see... I see Lee.
Guys.

760
00:34:01,705 --> 00:34:05,141
We have to go. Let's
get out of here now.

761
00:34:05,142 --> 00:34:07,108
Mike, we need to get
the hell out of here.

762
00:34:07,109 --> 00:34:08,109
Someone's coming.

763
00:34:09,012 --> 00:34:11,333
Someone's coming.
Go. Just go.

764
00:34:56,126 --> 00:34:57,329
That's just nuts.

765
00:35:00,329 --> 00:35:03,131
So, you saw four figures,
same as you?

766
00:35:03,132 --> 00:35:06,234
Except they had red glowsticks.

767
00:35:06,235 --> 00:35:08,171
Who had red glowsticks?

768
00:35:08,172 --> 00:35:09,971
They had the red glowsticks.

769
00:35:09,972 --> 00:35:12,774
We had the blue glowsticks.
That was the only difference.

770
00:35:12,775 --> 00:35:15,345
So, they must've opened the red
box when the lights went out.

771
00:35:15,346 --> 00:35:17,768
And you didn't say anything to them?
Would you?

772
00:35:18,048 --> 00:35:19,681
No, I wouldn't.

773
00:35:19,682 --> 00:35:22,285
I think I would've thought I was
going to die, or something.

774
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:24,220
Okay, okay.
So, that's it?

775
00:35:24,221 --> 00:35:27,156
Well, that and there's
this weird zone...

776
00:35:27,157 --> 00:35:28,924
that's even darker
than the rest of it all.

777
00:35:28,925 --> 00:35:31,328
We went through that.

778
00:35:31,329 --> 00:35:33,162
We went through that
when we went down there.

779
00:35:33,163 --> 00:35:35,531
We need to find out
what's going on.

780
00:35:35,532 --> 00:35:37,566
- The Internet's down. We don't have...
- We can't just sit here.

781
00:35:37,567 --> 00:35:40,370
What else?
Do you guys have any...

782
00:35:40,371 --> 00:35:42,238
Do you have books?

783
00:35:42,239 --> 00:35:43,672
Books on what?
Books on comets?

784
00:35:43,673 --> 00:35:45,308
Comets, gravity, black holes...

785
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:48,276
Yeah, I've got Shakespeare, some
Henry Miller and some screenplays.

786
00:35:48,277 --> 00:35:49,979
Dude, I'm a fucking actor.

787
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:52,281
Anything about quantum physics?

788
00:35:52,282 --> 00:35:54,850
Yeah, that's right up my alley.

789
00:35:54,851 --> 00:35:57,319
Some actors read.

790
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:00,656
Your brother left a book
at our house and...

791
00:36:00,657 --> 00:36:02,290
What?

792
00:36:02,291 --> 00:36:03,926
I put it in an envelope to mail,

793
00:36:03,927 --> 00:36:05,595
but I-I put it
in your car.

794
00:36:05,596 --> 00:36:07,629
- And it's about?
- I don't know what it's about.

795
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:09,299
- Comets?
- It's just one of his books.

796
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:11,066
It's always
about stuff like that.

797
00:36:11,067 --> 00:36:13,903
Yeah, I will... I will go get
the book I don't know about.

798
00:36:13,904 --> 00:36:17,140
Can somebody go with him?
Could you bring the bat?

799
00:36:17,141 --> 00:36:19,442
- Yeah.
- Yes. That's a good idea.

800
00:36:19,443 --> 00:36:21,780
Please be careful, babe.

801
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:24,513
Okay.

802
00:36:24,514 --> 00:36:26,348
Should we wake up Lee?

803
00:36:26,349 --> 00:36:29,219
How could she go to sleep
in the middle of all this?

804
00:36:31,088 --> 00:36:32,925
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, babe.

805
00:36:34,925 --> 00:36:36,892
Jesus.
Calm down, everybody.

806
00:36:36,893 --> 00:36:38,426
Oh, baby.

807
00:36:38,427 --> 00:36:40,170
I was gonna mail it back to him.

808
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:47,770
What is it?

809
00:36:47,771 --> 00:36:51,473
<i>"Gravitation: An Introduction
To Current Research."</i>

810
00:36:51,474 --> 00:36:53,142
That's not gonna apply.

811
00:36:53,143 --> 00:36:56,111
So, is his brother like
a scientist, or something?

812
00:36:56,112 --> 00:36:57,613
He's just a really trippy guy.

813
00:36:57,614 --> 00:36:59,082
He's really, really smart,
a real egghead.

814
00:36:59,083 --> 00:37:02,651
But it's hard to... It's
like he thinks out loud.

815
00:37:02,652 --> 00:37:05,179
He's a teacher at U.C.S.D.
What do you got, Hugh?

816
00:37:06,056 --> 00:37:08,223
This is...

817
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:12,261
These are Brian's notes from
his lesson plan for his class.

818
00:37:12,262 --> 00:37:15,899
"Decoherence and Schrödinger's
Cat." He talked about this.

819
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:19,435
Do you guys know what Schrödinger's cat is?
I'm allergic.

820
00:37:19,436 --> 00:37:22,872
So, it's a, um...
It's a thought experiment.

821
00:37:22,873 --> 00:37:24,640
There's a...
There's a cat in a box...

822
00:37:24,641 --> 00:37:27,642
that has, like, a 50/50
chance of living...

823
00:37:27,643 --> 00:37:29,245
because there's
a vial of poison...

824
00:37:29,246 --> 00:37:30,846
that's also in the box.

825
00:37:30,847 --> 00:37:34,415
So, regular physics would say
that it's one or the other.

826
00:37:34,416 --> 00:37:35,919
That the cat is
either alive or dead.

827
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,754
But Brian would argue
that quantum physics says...

828
00:37:38,755 --> 00:37:41,723
that both realities
exist simultaneously.

829
00:37:41,724 --> 00:37:45,261
It's only when you open the box
that they collapse...

830
00:37:45,262 --> 00:37:47,363
into a single event.
Right?

831
00:37:47,364 --> 00:37:50,499
So, listen to this.
This is what he's written.

832
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:52,201
"There is another theory:

833
00:37:52,202 --> 00:37:54,270
that two states
continue to exist...

834
00:37:54,271 --> 00:37:56,439
separate and decoherent
from each other,

835
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:59,073
each creating a new branch
of reality...

836
00:37:59,074 --> 00:38:00,709
based on the two outcomes.

837
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:03,745
Quantum decoherence ensures
that the different outcomes...

838
00:38:03,746 --> 00:38:06,549
have no interaction
with each other."

839
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:08,817
- Hold on.
- Well, that explains it.

840
00:38:08,818 --> 00:38:13,488
So we're in the box.
We're the cat.

841
00:38:13,489 --> 00:38:16,292
We're both alive and dead.

842
00:38:16,293 --> 00:38:21,330
So, there are... There are two
separate realities, and...

843
00:38:21,331 --> 00:38:24,299
presumably until
the comet passes.

844
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:26,435
- Until the comet passes?
- Okay.

845
00:38:26,436 --> 00:38:30,339
Or decoherence is maintained and
those two separate realities...

846
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:32,308
will remain separate
once the comet passes.

847
00:38:32,309 --> 00:38:33,810
Everybody will be fine.

848
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:35,812
Decoherence keeps us separate.

849
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:37,480
Right.

850
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:41,250
Why are the other us contacting
us then in this way?

851
00:38:41,251 --> 00:38:42,785
They didn't want to.

852
00:38:42,786 --> 00:38:45,087
Who got the pictures?
Who... The numbers?

853
00:38:45,088 --> 00:38:48,692
We started it when we went
to find a house with lights.

854
00:38:48,693 --> 00:38:51,227
Yeah, maybe they didn't
mean the box for us.

855
00:38:51,228 --> 00:38:53,796
The box isn't for us.

856
00:38:53,797 --> 00:38:57,667
What if we've already
interacted with ourselves?

857
00:38:57,668 --> 00:39:00,403
So, we're collapsing
on ourselves right now.

858
00:39:00,404 --> 00:39:03,138
Not if we stay separate
from each other.

859
00:39:03,139 --> 00:39:05,441
It's already too late.
We've already been there.

860
00:39:05,442 --> 00:39:08,678
<i>Do you remember that movie
Sliding Doors?</i>

861
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:11,781
Where just a fraction
of a second...

862
00:39:11,782 --> 00:39:13,848
there could be two realities?

863
00:39:13,849 --> 00:39:16,819
In one, she runs and tries to get
on the subway and she can't.

864
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:18,555
She gets her hand
stuck in the door.

865
00:39:18,556 --> 00:39:20,221
In the other one, she gets
through and there's two...

866
00:39:20,222 --> 00:39:22,692
If we're collapsing right now,
I'm gonna collapse on them.

867
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:24,426
I'm not gonna wait for
them to collapse on us.

868
00:39:24,427 --> 00:39:26,696
Whoa, whoa, Mike.

869
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:28,663
I'll go over there
and I'll just kill 'em.

870
00:39:28,664 --> 00:39:31,399
- What?
- Half-kidding.

871
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,868
- Mike, let's just...
- I love my fucking life.

872
00:39:32,869 --> 00:39:35,404
Let's be smart first before
we do anything stupid,

873
00:39:35,405 --> 00:39:36,906
and let's stick
with that we do know.

874
00:39:36,907 --> 00:39:39,808
And what's smart? Just sitting here?
Doing nothing?

875
00:39:39,809 --> 00:39:42,212
What we do know is that
we took this box. Right?

876
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:44,712
So, our first act should
be to return it. Yes?

877
00:39:44,713 --> 00:39:46,681
Fuck that. No. We're not
returning that box.

878
00:39:46,682 --> 00:39:48,618
I don't trust that house.
That stays here.

879
00:39:48,619 --> 00:39:50,819
Wait, wait, wait. What's
got you so freaked out?

880
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:53,555
- Stupid, stupid question.
- You're right.

881
00:39:53,556 --> 00:39:55,892
We're not at war with the
house down the street.

882
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:59,127
They might literally
be the same people as us.

883
00:39:59,128 --> 00:40:00,968
Mike's saying come over
here and let's kill us.

884
00:40:01,063 --> 00:40:06,134
That's right. If you do it first,
you know who you're gonna fight?

885
00:40:06,135 --> 00:40:07,636
Mike.
You.

886
00:40:07,637 --> 00:40:09,141
You're gonna run into you.

887
00:40:11,141 --> 00:40:12,247
Who's gonna win that?

888
00:40:13,834 --> 00:40:16,413
Who did you see in the window
when you went there?

889
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:18,314
- Did you see yourself?
- I did not see myself.

890
00:40:18,315 --> 00:40:19,881
- I told you who I saw.
- Okay, okay.

891
00:40:19,882 --> 00:40:24,553
But what if, in that over there,
that house, what if I'm drinking?

892
00:40:24,554 --> 00:40:26,607
I mean, just think
about that for a sec.

893
00:40:29,393 --> 00:40:31,426
That's a fucked-up Michael.

894
00:40:31,427 --> 00:40:33,629
Oh, God.

895
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:35,430
I'm not gonna wait
for a fucking drunk Mike...

896
00:40:35,431 --> 00:40:36,931
to come over here and kill me.

897
00:40:36,932 --> 00:40:39,672
And kill you and kill
you and kill you.

898
00:40:42,672 --> 00:40:44,474
I'm not waiting for that.

899
00:40:45,474 --> 00:40:47,910
Wait, wait, wait a minute.

900
00:40:47,911 --> 00:40:49,845
Who did you see
when you were there?

901
00:40:49,846 --> 00:40:55,384
I saw Amir, I saw Hugh,
and I saw Lee.

902
00:40:55,385 --> 00:40:57,252
Okay. Lee's
not here right now.

903
00:40:57,253 --> 00:40:59,522
- She's taking a nap.
- What do you mean, she's taking a nap?

904
00:40:59,523 --> 00:41:02,457
So, it's different, then. Something's off.
It's not the same.

905
00:41:02,458 --> 00:41:03,959
In this reality, Lee's napping.

906
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:06,761
Maybe in that reality,
you're napping?

907
00:41:06,762 --> 00:41:08,263
So, that's why Mike
didn't see her.

908
00:41:08,264 --> 00:41:11,802
Right, and if Beth is
napping in that reality...

909
00:41:12,802 --> 00:41:14,437
they don't have the book.

910
00:41:14,438 --> 00:41:15,971
- They don't.
- Right.

911
00:41:15,972 --> 00:41:17,640
The other house
doesn't have the book.

912
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:19,207
And if they don't have the book,

913
00:41:19,208 --> 00:41:22,977
they're not having this
conversation right now.

914
00:41:22,978 --> 00:41:25,714
So, then if we get
the book from the car...

915
00:41:25,715 --> 00:41:27,917
then we can avoid all this.

916
00:41:27,918 --> 00:41:29,551
Take it?
Take their book?

917
00:41:29,552 --> 00:41:31,789
It's a possibility.

918
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:35,290
Hugh, give me your keys. No, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait.

919
00:41:35,291 --> 00:41:37,799
We're not supposed to mess with any of this.

920
00:41:37,999 --> 00:41:39,595
Why would we even risk this?

921
00:41:39,596 --> 00:41:42,096
He's talking about going over and
fighting them. But why make it worse?

922
00:41:42,097 --> 00:41:44,399
Because then I don't have to
go over there and kill them.

923
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,935
Just give me the keys.

924
00:41:45,936 --> 00:41:49,071
No. I don't think that
we should do anything.

925
00:41:49,072 --> 00:41:51,282
And you are not taking my keys.

926
00:41:58,282 --> 00:42:00,518
Where you going, Mike?

927
00:42:01,186 --> 00:42:02,818
How do we know it's exactly us?

928
00:42:03,018 --> 00:42:06,288
What if it's just externals?
What if...

929
00:42:06,289 --> 00:42:07,957
- The dark side of us.
- Yeah.

930
00:42:07,958 --> 00:42:11,393
It's us, you guys. You mean,
the not friendly versions?

931
00:42:11,394 --> 00:42:15,564
Well, if it's us, then this
could be... Is it a good thing?

932
00:42:15,565 --> 00:42:17,866
It sounds like it would
be a way to reach...

933
00:42:17,867 --> 00:42:19,567
higher consciousness,
if we want to...

934
00:42:19,568 --> 00:42:21,403
Like an acceptance of ourselves?

935
00:42:21,404 --> 00:42:24,473
Well, yeah. We always talk about meeting
ourselves and finding ourselves,

936
00:42:24,474 --> 00:42:25,941
and here we have
an opportunity...

937
00:42:25,942 --> 00:42:28,544
to actually physically
find ourselves.

938
00:42:28,545 --> 00:42:30,078
That's a lot of pressure.

939
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:32,848
- Look who's joined us.
- Hi, everybody.

940
00:42:32,849 --> 00:42:34,982
How are you, honey?
Okay.

941
00:42:34,983 --> 00:42:36,685
Welcome back to your
own dinner party.

942
00:42:36,686 --> 00:42:38,854
Yeah. How's
my dinner party going?

943
00:42:38,855 --> 00:42:41,524
Super missed you.
It's going.

944
00:42:41,525 --> 00:42:42,525
I have an idea.

945
00:42:43,025 --> 00:42:45,093
I have an idea
that will prevent them...

946
00:42:45,094 --> 00:42:47,096
from getting the book
from the car.

947
00:42:47,097 --> 00:42:48,964
What are you talking about, man?

948
00:42:48,965 --> 00:42:51,799
I'm gonna go to that house, and
I'm gonna blackmail myself.

949
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,903
I'm gonna leave a note
to keep Mike...

950
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:55,904
from having them go to the
car to get that book.

951
00:42:55,905 --> 00:42:57,772
What do you mean,
a blackmail note?

952
00:42:57,773 --> 00:42:59,475
Something I know that I
don't want revealed.

953
00:42:59,476 --> 00:43:01,109
What are you talking about?

954
00:43:01,110 --> 00:43:02,678
The thing with Beth.

955
00:43:02,679 --> 00:43:04,346
The thing with Beth?

956
00:43:04,347 --> 00:43:06,681
I thought you and Hugh
worked that out years ago.

957
00:43:06,682 --> 00:43:08,917
This is the worst idea
I've ever heard.

958
00:43:08,918 --> 00:43:10,785
It's amazing, 'cause
it would work on me.

959
00:43:10,786 --> 00:43:13,089
- Going over there...
- It's the same person.

960
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:14,756
We don't...
You don't know that.

961
00:43:14,757 --> 00:43:16,591
This will pass.
It's brilliant.

962
00:43:16,592 --> 00:43:18,326
- No. It is not brilliant.
- It's brilliant.

963
00:43:18,327 --> 00:43:21,096
Dude, no. I know this
look in your eye.

964
00:43:21,097 --> 00:43:23,299
Mike, no.

965
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:25,200
Why would he even say that?

966
00:43:25,201 --> 00:43:26,701
Divergence. Otherwise,
it's just the same people.

967
00:43:26,702 --> 00:43:28,270
What's going on?

968
00:43:28,271 --> 00:43:29,904
And if it's the same people,

969
00:43:29,905 --> 00:43:31,908
then why not just
leave each other alone?

970
00:43:31,909 --> 00:43:33,676
That's what I would
want me to do.

971
00:43:33,677 --> 00:43:35,276
That might be
the best thing to do.

972
00:43:35,277 --> 00:43:37,078
Right?
You doing okay?

973
00:43:37,079 --> 00:43:38,513
Yeah, yeah.

974
00:43:38,514 --> 00:43:42,718
I don't know if I'm woozy from
the drops or if it's like...

975
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:44,553
What drops?
What drops?

976
00:43:44,554 --> 00:43:46,855
- Um...
- Did you give her...

977
00:43:46,856 --> 00:43:49,392
Yeah, well.
She wanted to take...

978
00:43:49,393 --> 00:43:52,261
I just felt so weird before.

979
00:43:52,262 --> 00:43:56,464
- It's this stuff I brought, this rescue remedy.
- What is it?

980
00:43:56,465 --> 00:44:01,104
It's got echinacea, golden seal,
passion flower and a little ketamine.

981
00:44:01,105 --> 00:44:03,672
I swear to God.

982
00:44:03,673 --> 00:44:05,374
- Ketamine?
- A little ketamine?

983
00:44:05,375 --> 00:44:07,942
- It's not like you're going to go into this...
- Beth.

984
00:44:07,943 --> 00:44:11,846
- What?
- I'm so sorry if I'm wrong here...

985
00:44:11,847 --> 00:44:14,984
and I'm saying something
incredibly inappropriate.

986
00:44:14,985 --> 00:44:17,785
What?

987
00:44:17,786 --> 00:44:21,290
Did you put any of that
in the food?

988
00:44:21,291 --> 00:44:23,591
Yes. That would explain a lot.
Lee asked me for some.

989
00:44:23,592 --> 00:44:25,227
Oh, come on, Amir.

990
00:44:25,228 --> 00:44:26,694
Are you serious?

991
00:44:26,695 --> 00:44:29,230
I had to ask.

992
00:44:29,231 --> 00:44:31,866
She asked to take some
and I gave her some.

993
00:44:31,867 --> 00:44:34,169
When we did the
mushrooms years ago,

994
00:44:34,170 --> 00:44:38,506
we talked about it, and I put
them in the spaghetti sauce.

995
00:44:38,507 --> 00:44:39,843
That was a group decision.

996
00:44:40,043 --> 00:44:42,111
I know we agreed,
but I had to ask because...

997
00:44:42,112 --> 00:44:45,259
You think that I would just
put drugs in your food?

998
00:44:45,459 --> 00:44:46,214
Oh, my God.

999
00:44:46,215 --> 00:44:48,084
Okay. I'll show you.

1000
00:44:48,085 --> 00:44:50,151
On top of all this,
you think I'd drug you?

1001
00:44:50,152 --> 00:44:52,754
I'll show you. Let's just
see how much is in there.

1002
00:44:52,755 --> 00:44:55,524
This is the vial I brought.

1003
00:44:55,525 --> 00:44:56,845
Yeah, and a quarter
of it is gone.

1004
00:44:57,027 --> 00:44:59,629
But that's... She's had
a couple of drops out of it.

1005
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:02,730
- That's it.
- This is, like, high-grade pharmaceutical...

1006
00:45:02,731 --> 00:45:04,799
It is watered down.
You can't.

1007
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,267
You opened it up
and watered it down?

1008
00:45:06,268 --> 00:45:07,803
Okay, but if you took
enough of it,

1009
00:45:08,003 --> 00:45:09,738
isn't it true that you
would have hallucinations?

1010
00:45:09,739 --> 00:45:11,239
You would have to have
a massive dose.

1011
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:13,075
You would have to take
the entire bottle.

1012
00:45:13,076 --> 00:45:14,445
Okay. Fine.
But is it true?

1013
00:45:16,313 --> 00:45:18,147
Yes. Okay. And is
it also true...

1014
00:45:18,148 --> 00:45:20,482
that one of the other
effects can be paranoia?

1015
00:45:20,483 --> 00:45:23,218
Yes, but you...

1016
00:45:23,219 --> 00:45:25,386
Again, you would have to have all of it.
The whole bottle.

1017
00:45:25,387 --> 00:45:26,907
The whole bottle.
And it would never...

1018
00:45:27,056 --> 00:45:30,326
Even if all of us
took a bottle each,

1019
00:45:30,327 --> 00:45:32,660
it would never create
a mass hallucination.

1020
00:45:32,661 --> 00:45:36,330
I'm not a criminal. It would be
a nice conclusion right now.

1021
00:45:36,331 --> 00:45:38,433
Wouldn't this be great
if we were hallucinating?

1022
00:45:38,434 --> 00:45:41,102
- Well, it's not the explanation.
- Fine.

1023
00:45:41,103 --> 00:45:44,806
I believe you. I asked for it.
This is the bottle.

1024
00:45:44,807 --> 00:45:46,942
She asked for it. I gave her some.
Okay.

1025
00:45:46,943 --> 00:45:49,078
I-I did not
drug your food.

1026
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:51,145
- I did not drug your food.
- I...

1027
00:45:51,146 --> 00:45:53,848
- Get it?
- Lay off, okay?

1028
00:45:53,849 --> 00:45:56,551
I swear to God.

1029
00:45:56,552 --> 00:45:57,552
Thanks.

1030
00:46:01,458 --> 00:46:03,959
Hey, where'd you get this?
This is so cute.

1031
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:06,127
Oh, I got it at, Galaxy.
That thrift store.

1032
00:46:06,128 --> 00:46:07,830
Oh, I love that place.

1033
00:46:07,831 --> 00:46:09,732
- That's great.
- They have such cute stuff.

1034
00:46:09,733 --> 00:46:12,334
I just...
I need a drink.

1035
00:46:12,335 --> 00:46:13,768
Yeah.

1036
00:46:13,769 --> 00:46:15,840
Okay.

1037
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:20,610
I just want to wake up
and start again, you know?

1038
00:46:35,324 --> 00:46:37,494
Blue.

1039
00:46:38,494 --> 00:46:40,062
It's not even cracked.

1040
00:46:40,063 --> 00:46:42,263
What are we gonna do?

1041
00:46:42,264 --> 00:46:44,433
We have to get the fuck
out of here.

1042
00:46:44,434 --> 00:46:46,167
Okay.

1043
00:46:46,168 --> 00:46:47,937
- Okay. Let's take...
- Take the book.

1044
00:46:47,938 --> 00:46:49,437
- Take the book.
- Do we take the box?

1045
00:46:49,438 --> 00:46:52,707
- Take the box. This is what they...
- Take it.

1046
00:46:52,708 --> 00:46:55,579
Hey. You okay?

1047
00:46:56,579 --> 00:46:58,048
Where'd you go?

1048
00:46:59,048 --> 00:47:00,848
I need a drink.

1049
00:47:00,849 --> 00:47:04,852
Hey. What...
Where'd you go?

1050
00:47:04,853 --> 00:47:06,555
I went to the house, dude.

1051
00:47:06,556 --> 00:47:09,124
- I told you.
- What happened?

1052
00:47:09,125 --> 00:47:11,160
I just dropped the letter off.

1053
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:15,430
I saw the book.

1054
00:47:15,431 --> 00:47:18,034
I was gonna... I was gonna
smash the window...

1055
00:47:19,034 --> 00:47:20,569
and take the book.

1056
00:47:20,570 --> 00:47:23,138
I didn't do that, though.
I did not do that.

1057
00:47:23,139 --> 00:47:26,609
I just dropped off
the letter, and, um...

1058
00:47:26,610 --> 00:47:31,712
then I was gonna wait,
to see their reaction.

1059
00:47:31,713 --> 00:47:33,582
But I fuckin' freaked out.

1060
00:47:33,583 --> 00:47:35,517
- You've been gone, like, five minutes.
- Like 45 minutes, dude.

1061
00:47:35,518 --> 00:47:37,185
- No. No. You talked to me.
- Bullshit.

1062
00:47:37,186 --> 00:47:38,888
You went in the kitchen.

1063
00:47:38,889 --> 00:47:42,191
You've been gone
for five, maybe 10 tops.

1064
00:47:42,192 --> 00:47:44,362
You're fuckin' crazy.

1065
00:47:46,362 --> 00:47:49,976
Oh, Mike.
Mike, don't do that.

1066
00:47:59,976 --> 00:48:01,661
- Oh, my God.
- Mike, what was...

1067
00:48:02,010 --> 00:48:03,812
Don't do this.

1068
00:48:03,813 --> 00:48:06,814
Mike, please?
Why now?

1069
00:48:06,815 --> 00:48:09,355
Why not now, honey?
Why not now?

1070
00:48:11,196 --> 00:48:13,723
- Where are Hugh and...
- We were in the kitchen.

1071
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:15,758
Where's...

1072
00:48:15,759 --> 00:48:18,761
- Where's Hugh?
- Where's Amir?

1073
00:48:18,762 --> 00:48:21,330
More importantly,
where's the box?

1074
00:48:21,331 --> 00:48:23,131
Oh, my God.
They took the box.

1075
00:48:23,132 --> 00:48:24,799
Mike, where did they go?

1076
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:27,703
I have no clue where they went.
You gotta be kidding.

1077
00:48:27,704 --> 00:48:29,337
You were in here.
What happened?

1078
00:48:29,338 --> 00:48:32,942
Where's the book?
Where's the book?

1079
00:48:32,943 --> 00:48:35,259
Why would they bring that
to the other house?

1080
00:48:35,612 --> 00:48:39,314
They said they wanted to take it back
so they could make everything right.

1081
00:48:39,315 --> 00:48:41,818
They wanted to return it, so everything
would be fine from the beginning, but...

1082
00:48:42,018 --> 00:48:45,187
Why would they bring the book? It's
the one thing that we wouldn't...

1083
00:48:45,188 --> 00:48:48,057
- They took everything we have.
- Wait a minute.

1084
00:48:49,057 --> 00:48:50,625
We have to go get them.

1085
00:48:50,626 --> 00:48:52,995
Wait a minute. They were the
first ones to leave, right?

1086
00:48:52,996 --> 00:48:55,830
And then they... They came back.
They said they saw something.

1087
00:48:55,831 --> 00:48:57,431
They've been acting weird
ever since.

1088
00:48:57,432 --> 00:49:01,905
What are you implying?
Oh, my God.

1089
00:49:02,505 --> 00:49:05,207
- No, that's... Well, you guys left, too.
- Think about it.

1090
00:49:05,208 --> 00:49:06,942
I mean, everyone...
You left, too.

1091
00:49:06,943 --> 00:49:08,676
Amir came back and got
so quiet, Come on.

1092
00:49:08,677 --> 00:49:10,446
And then...
and he didn't...

1093
00:49:10,447 --> 00:49:12,413
- Amir was being totally weird.
- I'll bring 'em back.

1094
00:49:12,414 --> 00:49:14,283
- I'll see what's going on.
- Baby, you're not...

1095
00:49:14,284 --> 00:49:15,884
- You're not going anywhere.
- I'll be back.

1096
00:49:15,885 --> 00:49:17,852
I'm just gonna go
bring them back...

1097
00:49:17,853 --> 00:49:19,321
and find out what
the hell's going on.

1098
00:49:19,322 --> 00:49:21,355
- No. You're not leaving.
- Baby, relax. What?

1099
00:49:21,356 --> 00:49:22,991
- No.
- It's fine. I'll be back.

1100
00:49:22,992 --> 00:49:26,697
I'm not gonna let you go.

1101
00:49:27,697 --> 00:49:30,206
It would be fucking crazy.

1102
00:49:36,206 --> 00:49:37,785
Okay. So, what
are we gonna do?

1103
00:49:37,985 --> 00:49:41,343
I mean, they're out there, and I swear
to God, I'm gonna have a heart attack.

1104
00:49:41,344 --> 00:49:43,178
- We've gotta do something.
- Let's have a drink.

1105
00:49:43,179 --> 00:49:44,946
We don't even know
if that was them.

1106
00:49:44,947 --> 00:49:46,781
Would you quit
saying that, please?

1107
00:49:46,782 --> 00:49:48,917
No, but if it wasn't them,
then Mike is right,

1108
00:49:48,918 --> 00:49:50,451
and we can't trust
the other house.

1109
00:49:50,452 --> 00:49:52,154
- We can't trust ourselves.
- That's right.

1110
00:49:52,155 --> 00:49:55,762
- Jesus.
- And our clues just left the house.

1111
00:49:58,762 --> 00:50:01,763
No. Wait.

1112
00:50:01,764 --> 00:50:05,399
The clues are still here.

1113
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:07,903
If they had
the pictures, then...

1114
00:50:07,904 --> 00:50:10,339
Mike, you took that picture
of me and Kevin. Right?

1115
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:13,308
Do you have it here?

1116
00:50:13,309 --> 00:50:16,444
I-I can't take this anymore.
I can't take it.

1117
00:50:16,445 --> 00:50:19,024
- Sweetheart...
- Can you at least go look for it?

1118
00:50:21,317 --> 00:50:23,869
I'm gonna look
for another bottle of wine.

1119
00:50:40,869 --> 00:50:42,940
This is so stupid.

1120
00:50:43,836 --> 00:50:45,573
Should I be keeping
an eye on him?

1121
00:50:45,574 --> 00:50:48,776
I feel like
I don't want to hover, and...

1122
00:50:48,777 --> 00:50:51,849
I don't know.

1123
00:50:53,849 --> 00:50:55,920
Just give it a minute,
and then...

1124
00:50:57,920 --> 00:50:59,552
go in and talk to him, I guess.

1125
00:51:02,324 --> 00:51:05,861
I don't know who Mike is anymore.
Not when he drinks.

1126
00:51:05,862 --> 00:51:08,564
Everything that's gone wrong with us
started when he started drinking.

1127
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:10,332
It's why we had
to leave L.A.

1128
00:51:10,333 --> 00:51:12,234
It's why he doesn't
have a career.

1129
00:51:12,235 --> 00:51:14,837
He's just...
I don't know.

1130
00:51:14,838 --> 00:51:16,697
Not the man I married.

1131
00:52:18,634 --> 00:52:20,301
Hey.

1132
00:52:20,302 --> 00:52:22,404
- Hey.
- How you doing?

1133
00:52:22,405 --> 00:52:24,007
How you holding up?

1134
00:52:25,007 --> 00:52:27,308
All things considered,
all right.

1135
00:52:27,309 --> 00:52:29,710
I totally don't believe you.

1136
00:52:29,711 --> 00:52:31,747
Yeah. Well, am I being
some... What's going on?

1137
00:52:31,748 --> 00:52:33,549
I... Amir told me you were
gonna go to Vietnam...

1138
00:52:33,550 --> 00:52:35,149
and Em's not going with you?

1139
00:52:35,150 --> 00:52:37,151
Yeah. I...

1140
00:52:37,152 --> 00:52:38,854
I gotta go for work
for, I don't know...

1141
00:52:39,054 --> 00:52:41,290
It's four months, I think, and,

1142
00:52:41,291 --> 00:52:43,325
yeah, I want her
to come along, but...

1143
00:52:43,326 --> 00:52:44,826
She'd be crazy
not to go with you.

1144
00:52:44,827 --> 00:52:46,196
Yeah. That's what I think.

1145
00:52:47,030 --> 00:52:48,730
Yeah. I don't...
I don't know.

1146
00:52:48,731 --> 00:52:50,866
I mean, it's... I-I really
don't want to interfere.

1147
00:52:50,867 --> 00:52:52,533
It doesn't seem like
any of my business,

1148
00:52:52,534 --> 00:52:55,203
but I think you've
always been someone...

1149
00:52:55,204 --> 00:52:58,640
who's extremely passionate about
your life and what you're doing,

1150
00:52:58,641 --> 00:53:01,576
and if you have a partner that
seems to hesitate all the time,

1151
00:53:01,577 --> 00:53:05,848
with things of life, I don't know
if that's gonna make you happy.

1152
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:08,316
Oh. She's...

1153
00:53:08,317 --> 00:53:10,791
I mean, I love her, and...
It's just who she is.

1154
00:53:11,054 --> 00:53:13,822
- Sometimes she's a little...
- Tall?

1155
00:53:16,626 --> 00:53:18,725
- Crazy.
- She's a little bit tall.

1156
00:53:18,726 --> 00:53:20,966
I mean, do you have to stand
on your tiptoes to kiss her?

1157
00:53:21,063 --> 00:53:23,063
I...

1158
00:53:26,969 --> 00:53:29,203
Sometimes people just fit well.

1159
00:53:29,204 --> 00:53:32,274
Laurie...
Like that Sharks game?

1160
00:53:32,275 --> 00:53:35,442
Come on, you can't tell me
we don't fit well.

1161
00:53:35,443 --> 00:53:38,145
I had to do yoga for a week
afterwards to recover.

1162
00:53:38,146 --> 00:53:41,149
I do remember that.

1163
00:53:41,150 --> 00:53:44,990
I just think that maybe...

1164
00:53:48,990 --> 00:53:50,926
Laurie.

1165
00:53:50,927 --> 00:53:53,948
I'm sorry. I'm crossing all
kinds of boundaries with you.

1166
00:53:53,949 --> 00:53:54,804
Yeah.

1167
00:54:05,273 --> 00:54:08,410
Baby?
Hi.

1168
00:54:08,411 --> 00:54:11,846
You know, I think
you're right...

1169
00:54:11,847 --> 00:54:14,152
that everything happens
for a reason.

1170
00:54:21,623 --> 00:54:24,826
Should I get the bat?

1171
00:54:24,827 --> 00:54:27,096
For you or for me?

1172
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:28,500
Could be either.

1173
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:33,901
What are we doing here?

1174
00:54:33,902 --> 00:54:39,009
If I'm losing it over there,
I'm losing it here.

1175
00:54:39,988 --> 00:54:42,410
It doesn't have to be like that.
Sure, it does.

1176
00:54:42,411 --> 00:54:44,479
It's the same thing.

1177
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:46,982
No, it's not.

1178
00:54:46,983 --> 00:54:49,718
How do you figure?

1179
00:54:49,719 --> 00:54:54,522
Because there's no way that anybody
over there, or... or anywhere,

1180
00:54:54,523 --> 00:54:58,300
loves you as much
as I love you right here.

1181
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:07,846
I fucked up.

1182
00:55:16,846 --> 00:55:19,413
Hi.
Hey.

1183
00:55:19,414 --> 00:55:23,252
How you doing?

1184
00:55:23,253 --> 00:55:26,923
Fine.

1185
00:55:27,923 --> 00:55:30,625
Is... Is everything okay?

1186
00:55:30,626 --> 00:55:33,864
Is there something going on?

1187
00:55:34,864 --> 00:55:39,167
Beth just walked up to me and...

1188
00:55:39,168 --> 00:55:43,571
she didn't really say much,
but she said that she...

1189
00:55:43,572 --> 00:55:46,809
saw you and Laurie talk
in the hallway, and...

1190
00:55:47,768 --> 00:55:49,611
Jesus Christ, Em.
I think we have...

1191
00:55:49,612 --> 00:55:51,578
some more important things
to worry about right now...

1192
00:55:51,579 --> 00:55:53,887
than what Beth is saying.

1193
00:55:57,887 --> 00:56:00,120
Jesus Christ.

1194
00:56:00,121 --> 00:56:02,457
Are you kidding me? That
would be the generator.

1195
00:56:02,458 --> 00:56:04,993
- Hold on.
- All right. You know what to do.

1196
00:56:04,994 --> 00:56:06,863
- We have thousands of matches at home.
- Don't burn yourself.

1197
00:56:07,063 --> 00:56:09,397
- Kevin, do you have matches?
- Yeah, I got some.

1198
00:56:09,398 --> 00:56:11,566
Here.

1199
00:56:11,567 --> 00:56:13,201
- Hold it.
- I don't know...

1200
00:56:13,202 --> 00:56:15,537
- You want to put this on the table?
- Yeah. Yeah.

1201
00:56:15,538 --> 00:56:17,738
That was right out front.

1202
00:56:17,739 --> 00:56:19,908
- Are you kidding?
- That sounds like one of our cars.

1203
00:56:19,909 --> 00:56:21,642
Like one of our cars
getting broken into.

1204
00:56:21,643 --> 00:56:23,310
Look, I'm going out there.
I can't stand this.

1205
00:56:23,311 --> 00:56:25,747
- I'm gonna go see what's going on.
- Not without the rest of us.

1206
00:56:25,748 --> 00:56:28,649
- Let's just all go.
- Fine. Then let's all go, but I'm going.

1207
00:56:28,650 --> 00:56:30,384
- I'll get my coat.
- I don't think we should.

1208
00:56:30,385 --> 00:56:32,025
- Let's get a flashlight.
- We'll be fine.

1209
00:56:32,054 --> 00:56:34,122
- Here. I got one here.
- You guys lead, okay?

1210
00:56:34,123 --> 00:56:35,656
- You ready?
- Okay. Here we go.

1211
00:56:35,657 --> 00:56:37,459
- Stay close. Stay close.
- Here we go.

1212
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:40,166
- Where did it come from?
- I don't know.

1213
00:56:45,166 --> 00:56:46,166
That's it, right?

1214
00:56:49,072 --> 00:56:51,907
Oh, my God.
Jesus. Look.

1215
00:56:52,907 --> 00:56:56,845
- Is there anything in there?
- I don't see anything.

1216
00:56:56,846 --> 00:56:59,480
Oh, my God.
Should we...

1217
00:56:59,481 --> 00:57:01,582
- Should we check our cars?
- That's crazy.

1218
00:57:01,583 --> 00:57:03,151
Yeah, why doesn't everybody
check their own car.

1219
00:57:03,152 --> 00:57:05,287
- See if we find anything else.
- Let's look at our cars.

1220
00:57:05,288 --> 00:57:07,587
- Okay.
- All right. After you.

1221
00:57:07,588 --> 00:57:10,926
Is everyone nearby?

1222
00:57:10,927 --> 00:57:13,996
We shouldn't spread out
too much.

1223
00:57:31,679 --> 00:57:34,147
- Hey.
- Everything okay?

1224
00:57:34,148 --> 00:57:37,718
Yeah. I just...

1225
00:57:37,719 --> 00:57:42,656
put this ring on that
you got me at the fair.

1226
00:57:42,657 --> 00:57:44,027
Remember?
I know it's...

1227
00:57:45,027 --> 00:57:47,863
I know it's cheesy, but I
just wanted to have it on.

1228
00:57:47,864 --> 00:57:49,930
Cheeseball.

1229
00:57:49,931 --> 00:57:54,201
- It was a good day.
- It was a good day.

1230
00:57:54,202 --> 00:57:56,571
Are we okay?

1231
00:57:56,572 --> 00:58:00,542
- Yeah, babe.
- After that whole Laurie thing?

1232
00:58:00,543 --> 00:58:02,710
Yeah.

1233
00:58:02,711 --> 00:58:04,513
I don't know what the
hell she's thinking,

1234
00:58:04,514 --> 00:58:07,549
but yeah, we're good.

1235
00:58:07,550 --> 00:58:10,425
Come here. Hey.

1236
00:58:15,425 --> 00:58:17,959
Is everything okay
with Hugh's car?

1237
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:22,830
- What do you mean?
- Well, did they take anything?

1238
00:58:22,831 --> 00:58:25,730
You just checked on his car.
Did they take anything?

1239
00:58:54,730 --> 00:58:56,897
Doesn't make any sense at all.

1240
00:58:56,898 --> 00:58:59,433
Do you think it's just someone
trying to intimidate us?

1241
00:58:59,434 --> 00:59:00,968
Intimidate? No.
I... It's...

1242
00:59:00,969 --> 00:59:03,303
None of this...
It doesn't...

1243
00:59:03,304 --> 00:59:06,540
I mean, it's like they're
looking for something, and...

1244
00:59:06,541 --> 00:59:09,778
- But there's nothing in there.
- Exactly. There's nothing in there. So, why...

1245
00:59:09,779 --> 00:59:11,245
They could see that
there's nothing in there.

1246
00:59:11,246 --> 00:59:13,214
- We could see that there's nothing in there.
- I know.

1247
00:59:13,215 --> 00:59:15,817
Why break the window
if there's nothing there?

1248
00:59:15,818 --> 00:59:19,221
- That doesn't make any sense.
- None of this makes any sense.

1249
00:59:19,222 --> 00:59:20,754
Where were you?

1250
00:59:20,755 --> 00:59:24,192
I went and got this ring.

1251
00:59:24,193 --> 00:59:27,398
Nice.

1252
00:59:28,361 --> 00:59:30,098
All right, hold on.
Let's-Let's...

1253
00:59:30,099 --> 00:59:33,100
Let's just try and figure out...

1254
00:59:33,101 --> 00:59:39,073
why we would break into
a car... Hugh's car...

1255
00:59:39,074 --> 00:59:41,343
knowing that the book
wasn't there.

1256
00:59:41,344 --> 00:59:43,310
Well, we're assuming
that the book is the motive.

1257
00:59:43,311 --> 00:59:46,214
What if the motive
is completely different?

1258
00:59:46,215 --> 00:59:48,149
- Did you hear something?
- What the hell is that?

1259
00:59:48,150 --> 00:59:49,917
It's outside. No, Mike,
Mike, Mike, Mike.

1260
00:59:49,918 --> 00:59:53,488
- Oh, shit! There's someone coming.
- What?

1261
00:59:53,489 --> 00:59:55,524
They're coming over here, guys.

1262
00:59:55,525 --> 00:59:57,424
Yeah. It's Hugh.

1263
00:59:57,425 --> 00:59:59,227
- Is it Hugh?
- Is it Hugh and Amir?

1264
00:59:59,228 --> 01:00:01,861
Yeah, it's blue.
It's Hugh and Amir. Cool.

1265
01:00:01,931 --> 01:00:04,466
- They're coming to the door.
- Are you sure?

1266
01:00:04,467 --> 01:00:07,701
- It looks like it.
- Oh, baby.

1267
01:00:07,702 --> 01:00:09,437
Are you all okay?

1268
01:00:09,438 --> 01:00:12,874
Hey, where have you been?
What happened? Okay.

1269
01:00:12,875 --> 01:00:16,143
What have you been... Why did
you take... What did you do?

1270
01:00:16,144 --> 01:00:19,180
- Can you please tell us what happened?
- We went to...

1271
01:00:19,181 --> 01:00:22,149
We went to make a phone call,
and then when...

1272
01:00:22,150 --> 01:00:24,118
when we looked
in the door, we saw...

1273
01:00:24,119 --> 01:00:28,355
We saw this, basically.
I, I got startled.

1274
01:00:28,356 --> 01:00:30,825
I fell over. I hit my head.
We went back to the house to...

1275
01:00:31,025 --> 01:00:33,127
Wait. You already
came back here.

1276
01:00:33,128 --> 01:00:34,930
We already heard this story.

1277
01:00:34,931 --> 01:00:36,765
Why are you telling us
this story again?

1278
01:00:36,766 --> 01:00:38,366
- You came back with the box.
- Wait. What?

1279
01:00:38,367 --> 01:00:40,468
Because you came back,
and after you hit your head...

1280
01:00:40,469 --> 01:00:43,624
We gave him a Band-Aid
and you gave us the...

1281
01:00:43,824 --> 01:00:45,473
But not that Band-Aid.

1282
01:00:45,474 --> 01:00:49,243
- What do you mean?
- Oh, my God. I gave you a cloth Band-Aid.

1283
01:00:49,244 --> 01:00:52,613
Wait a minute. Hugh... There
was a Hugh and an Amir here?

1284
01:00:52,614 --> 01:00:54,482
Yes. And you left
with the book.

1285
01:00:54,483 --> 01:00:57,250
You left with the pictures, and
we didn't know where you went.

1286
01:00:57,251 --> 01:00:59,787
We were at a house where
everybody had red glowsticks.

1287
01:00:59,788 --> 01:01:02,390
- You had red glowsticks.
- Do you understand?

1288
01:01:02,391 --> 01:01:06,393
We... We have red glow... We took
them from the other house.

1289
01:01:06,394 --> 01:01:08,495
- Right.
- Look. Look.

1290
01:01:08,496 --> 01:01:11,765
Is that... Look. That box of
red glowsticks is unopened.

1291
01:01:11,766 --> 01:01:14,868
Guys, if they started here,
they belong here.

1292
01:01:14,869 --> 01:01:17,105
They're in the right house.

1293
01:01:17,106 --> 01:01:19,941
- Well, welcome back.
- Welcome back.

1294
01:01:19,942 --> 01:01:22,576
- Jeez, man, I'm sorry.
- That's all right.

1295
01:01:22,577 --> 01:01:24,611
Sorry.

1296
01:01:24,612 --> 01:01:28,850
So, guys, what was the other Mike like?
What was he doing?

1297
01:01:28,851 --> 01:01:32,255
The other Mike is...
He's worried about you.

1298
01:01:34,184 --> 01:01:36,290
So, it was you guys
who left us the note.

1299
01:01:36,291 --> 01:01:39,928
No, I never got out
with that note.

1300
01:01:39,929 --> 01:01:41,761
We ended up with two notes.

1301
01:01:41,762 --> 01:01:43,797
And so did we.

1302
01:01:43,798 --> 01:01:45,633
Well, where's...
We have two notes.

1303
01:01:45,634 --> 01:01:49,005
One that was written here and
one that was left on the door.

1304
01:01:50,005 --> 01:01:53,308
If you didn't, and if
the other Hugh didn't,

1305
01:01:53,309 --> 01:01:56,509
then who has been
leaving the notes?

1306
01:01:56,510 --> 01:01:59,814
"Quantum decoherence ensures
that the different outcomes...

1307
01:01:59,815 --> 01:02:02,149
have no interaction
with one another."

1308
01:02:02,150 --> 01:02:04,752
So, that one note has been
written at least four times.

1309
01:02:04,753 --> 01:02:07,806
Well, how many Hugh and Amirs
are walking around out there?

1310
01:02:10,626 --> 01:02:12,160
Okay, before we do anything,

1311
01:02:12,161 --> 01:02:15,196
we have to figure out
how to mark our own house.

1312
01:02:15,197 --> 01:02:17,732
Just stay inside. No, no.
She's right.

1313
01:02:17,733 --> 01:02:20,234
Staying inside isn't realistic.

1314
01:02:20,235 --> 01:02:23,238
We need some kind of marker.
We got to mark this house.

1315
01:02:23,239 --> 01:02:24,939
If every house is the same...

1316
01:02:24,940 --> 01:02:27,075
If we put a marker
in front of the house,

1317
01:02:27,076 --> 01:02:29,109
there could be an infinite
number of houses with that mark.

1318
01:02:29,110 --> 01:02:30,944
So, we have to do
something random.

1319
01:02:30,945 --> 01:02:32,413
Something that can't be repeated.
Something unique.

1320
01:02:32,414 --> 01:02:34,781
Dice. Do we have dice?
We have dice?

1321
01:02:34,782 --> 01:02:38,787
- Um, Yahtzee.
- Yeah, Yahtzee.

1322
01:02:38,788 --> 01:02:42,890
If we each roll a number for each
of us, that's what? That's...

1323
01:02:42,891 --> 01:02:45,893
Six times six times six times six
times... That's hugely random.

1324
01:02:45,894 --> 01:02:49,698
- The probability of that repeating is... tiny.
- And then what? We...

1325
01:02:49,699 --> 01:02:52,200
But so we have to have
something visual.

1326
01:02:52,201 --> 01:02:54,181
I mean, should we write
it down, put it in...

1327
01:02:54,381 --> 01:02:56,136
put it outside? Put it in an envelope?

1328
01:02:56,137 --> 01:02:57,772
We still won't know.
No, no, no, no.

1329
01:02:57,773 --> 01:02:59,439
We need something to mark it.

1330
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:02,643
Yeah. We put it in a box.

1331
01:03:02,644 --> 01:03:04,712
- That's, that's...
- That's exactly what they've done.

1332
01:03:04,713 --> 01:03:07,381
- They were ahead of us.
- They were making a marker for their house.

1333
01:03:07,382 --> 01:03:09,783
They made a unique mark.
Only we took it.

1334
01:03:09,784 --> 01:03:11,752
If it seems like
a good idea to us,

1335
01:03:11,753 --> 01:03:13,254
it would seem like
a good idea to them.

1336
01:03:13,255 --> 01:03:16,524
- Do you have a box?
- Yeah. Yeah, let me look.

1337
01:03:16,525 --> 01:03:18,359
So, we need photos.

1338
01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:21,296
This is so crazy.
It's par for the night.

1339
01:03:21,297 --> 01:03:23,631
- There are a lot of pictures here.
- You can't use that picture.

1340
01:03:23,632 --> 01:03:25,633
That's ridiculous.

1341
01:03:25,634 --> 01:03:28,903
- I'm the attorney for Grizzly Adams.
- Yeah, I know. This is...

1342
01:03:28,904 --> 01:03:30,738
I'm never hiring you.

1343
01:03:30,739 --> 01:03:33,741
How does this work as a box?

1344
01:03:33,742 --> 01:03:35,442
I didn't even know we had it.

1345
01:03:35,443 --> 01:03:37,979
It was just under
a pile of crap in the back.

1346
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:39,779
If you can...
That'll work.

1347
01:03:39,780 --> 01:03:41,517
So, tha... Tha...
That's your box?

1348
01:03:42,016 --> 01:03:45,151
- It was here all the time.
- Of course it was.

1349
01:03:45,152 --> 01:03:48,689
I'm not too happy
about cutting these pictures.

1350
01:03:48,690 --> 01:03:51,225
And we only have pictures of
you and I together, babe.

1351
01:03:51,226 --> 01:03:54,796
I actually... I actually
have a photo of Kevin.

1352
01:03:54,797 --> 01:03:56,763
- I know that's strange. Um...
- What?

1353
01:03:56,764 --> 01:03:59,767
No, I have my, um...

1354
01:03:59,768 --> 01:04:03,238
My checking account number is written on
the back of this old photo that I have,

1355
01:04:03,239 --> 01:04:05,506
and it's just been
in my wallet forever.

1356
01:04:05,507 --> 01:04:07,174
It's right here.

1357
01:04:07,175 --> 01:04:09,810
What? You know what?
I-I'll just...

1358
01:04:09,811 --> 01:04:12,946
- I'll cut this picture that we have here.
- Just use this one. It's okay.

1359
01:04:12,947 --> 01:04:16,350
Just scratch off the number.
Cut.

1360
01:04:16,351 --> 01:04:18,653
Great. I think we got one
of everybody except me, so...

1361
01:04:18,654 --> 01:04:21,857
I'm glad you guys all keep a lot
of pictures of your friend, Amir.

1362
01:04:22,057 --> 01:04:25,057
Well, we'll take one of you.

1363
01:04:25,893 --> 01:04:27,862
Smile, dickhead.

1364
01:04:30,097 --> 01:04:31,765
Let me see.

1365
01:04:31,766 --> 01:04:33,301
It's not exactly the same.

1366
01:04:33,302 --> 01:04:36,169
It's not the same as
the one from the other box.

1367
01:04:36,170 --> 01:04:39,808
They took a picture of me in the other
house, but it's not exactly the same.

1368
01:04:39,809 --> 01:04:43,111
This is what we're talking about.
That's a moment where it can be...

1369
01:04:43,112 --> 01:04:44,645
a different...
a divergent moment.

1370
01:04:44,646 --> 01:04:46,980
That's what we're gonna do
right now with these dice.

1371
01:04:46,981 --> 01:04:48,850
Wait. Since we're
the blue house,

1372
01:04:48,851 --> 01:04:50,384
shouldn't we use a blue pen?

1373
01:04:50,385 --> 01:04:52,220
- Just to make it even more...
- That makes sense.

1374
01:04:52,221 --> 01:04:54,388
Yeah?
The odds go up by three.

1375
01:04:54,389 --> 01:04:56,691
So, does everyone have a die?

1376
01:04:56,692 --> 01:04:58,326
- What's yours?
- Beth?

1377
01:04:58,327 --> 01:05:00,493
All right.

1378
01:05:00,494 --> 01:05:03,598
Six.

1379
01:05:03,599 --> 01:05:05,866
Hugh?
Three.

1380
01:05:05,867 --> 01:05:08,134
Mike?
Four.

1381
01:05:08,135 --> 01:05:10,104
Six.

1382
01:05:10,105 --> 01:05:13,207
Two.

1383
01:05:13,208 --> 01:05:15,509
You guys know what a quick code is?
You know when you...

1384
01:05:15,510 --> 01:05:17,578
are going online, going
into your bank account,

1385
01:05:17,579 --> 01:05:19,613
and when you go to your
password, it'll give you...

1386
01:05:19,614 --> 01:05:21,616
a picture to choose?

1387
01:05:21,617 --> 01:05:25,520
That's your quick code. That's called an
MFA. It's a multi-factor authenticator.

1388
01:05:25,521 --> 01:05:27,856
We do 'em. We put 'em in
whenever we build our big sites.

1389
01:05:28,056 --> 01:05:29,823
It's an icon, right?

1390
01:05:29,824 --> 01:05:32,960
- Sort of a random...
- A random object.

1391
01:05:32,961 --> 01:05:34,761
Yeah. So, what if
each of these...

1392
01:05:34,762 --> 01:05:38,299
has a random object in it to sort
of serve as that quick code, right?

1393
01:05:38,300 --> 01:05:40,567
Right. Right. So, we pick
something to put in there.

1394
01:05:40,568 --> 01:05:44,138
You could put anything in there, right?
A candle or a book or, um...

1395
01:05:44,139 --> 01:05:46,874
- The oven mitt.
- Or a ping-pong paddle.

1396
01:05:46,875 --> 01:05:49,609
Or a ping-pong paddle.
Exactly. Yeah.

1397
01:05:49,610 --> 01:05:53,180
Exactly.

1398
01:05:53,181 --> 01:05:55,850
- Well, how's this? And this is random, right?
- A coaster?

1399
01:05:56,050 --> 01:05:58,118
Is anything
really random tonight?

1400
01:05:58,119 --> 01:05:59,821
If you have to leave,

1401
01:05:59,822 --> 01:06:01,321
when you check the box,
open it up,

1402
01:06:01,322 --> 01:06:03,323
you see that, you know
you're off to a good start.

1403
01:06:03,324 --> 01:06:05,093
I feel better.

1404
01:06:05,094 --> 01:06:06,727
Okay.
So we've got the box.

1405
01:06:06,728 --> 01:06:09,163
Yeah, and it only took all
night to figure it out.

1406
01:06:09,164 --> 01:06:10,765
We've marked the house.
If we stay together,

1407
01:06:10,766 --> 01:06:15,069
keep our heads up, and nobody wanders
off, we can get through this.

1408
01:06:15,070 --> 01:06:16,703
- Thanks, coach.
- Yeah.

1409
01:06:16,704 --> 01:06:19,741
- You want something?
- Yeah, water. Water would be great.

1410
01:06:19,742 --> 01:06:21,908
I'm gonna get a drink.

1411
01:06:21,909 --> 01:06:25,015
I wonder how different those
numbers are from the first box?

1412
01:06:25,947 --> 01:06:27,881
Let me check.

1413
01:06:27,882 --> 01:06:30,149
Where's my calculator?

1414
01:06:30,150 --> 01:06:35,256
Let's see.
So, if there's eight of us...

1415
01:06:35,257 --> 01:06:39,361
and it's six times six...

1416
01:06:39,362 --> 01:06:41,729
times six.

1417
01:06:41,730 --> 01:06:47,368
Three different colored
glowsticks times three...

1418
01:06:47,369 --> 01:06:53,140
is 5,038,848 possible variables.

1419
01:06:53,141 --> 01:06:55,983
So, that's the variable.

1420
01:07:02,983 --> 01:07:05,983
Are you okay?

1421
01:07:14,597 --> 01:07:16,663
Everything okay
with the numbers?

1422
01:07:16,664 --> 01:07:18,598
Yeah.

1423
01:07:18,599 --> 01:07:23,236
D-Do you remember what number was
written on the back of your picture?

1424
01:07:23,237 --> 01:07:25,473
- Five. -
- Yeah?

1425
01:07:25,474 --> 01:07:29,611
I found a good spot out front, just as long
as another Hugh and Amir don't come by.

1426
01:07:29,612 --> 01:07:32,145
Kevin, do you remember what number was
written on the back of your picture?

1427
01:07:32,146 --> 01:07:35,816
- Six.
- Yeah?

1428
01:07:35,817 --> 01:07:39,153
- Beth?
- Three.

1429
01:07:39,154 --> 01:07:40,855
Hugh, do you remember?

1430
01:07:40,856 --> 01:07:42,278
- I was a three.
- You sure?

1431
01:07:43,023 --> 01:07:46,960
Yeah. What's going on
in the kitchen?

1432
01:07:46,961 --> 01:07:49,196
- Pound cake.
- Pound cake.

1433
01:07:49,197 --> 01:07:51,899
The girls are
breaking out dessert...

1434
01:07:51,900 --> 01:07:54,474
before the other house eats it.

1435
01:07:58,474 --> 01:08:00,527
Hey, Mike, I need
to show you something.

1436
01:08:04,045 --> 01:08:06,613
The numbers that I remember...

1437
01:08:06,614 --> 01:08:09,614
from the box that was brought
here from the other house...

1438
01:08:10,052 --> 01:08:12,422
are these numbers.

1439
01:08:14,422 --> 01:08:17,759
But these are the numbers
that I found here...

1440
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:20,827
in this notepad.

1441
01:08:20,828 --> 01:08:24,398
And I just asked everyone if
they can remember their number.

1442
01:08:24,399 --> 01:08:27,602
Beth and Lee are from
this house originally,

1443
01:08:27,603 --> 01:08:31,171
because they have never left.

1444
01:08:31,172 --> 01:08:35,609
But the rest of us...
We are not from this house.

1445
01:08:35,610 --> 01:08:38,112
We are visitors.

1446
01:08:38,113 --> 01:08:40,618
Which means that this Lee
is not your wife.

1447
01:08:42,618 --> 01:08:45,618
Are you with me?

1448
01:08:49,190 --> 01:08:52,126
Well, there's more.

1449
01:08:52,127 --> 01:08:55,127
Because Hugh and Amir...

1450
01:08:55,463 --> 01:08:57,797
are from a third house.

1451
01:08:57,798 --> 01:09:01,270
He just showed me his phone.
It's not cracked.

1452
01:09:03,270 --> 01:09:06,306
Remember that dark area
that we walked through?

1453
01:09:06,307 --> 01:09:08,709
I have a feeling that whoever
walks through that...

1454
01:09:08,710 --> 01:09:12,345
is like they end up in the
middle of a roulette wheel,

1455
01:09:12,346 --> 01:09:15,582
and they will just end up
somewhere by chance.

1456
01:09:15,583 --> 01:09:17,617
And whoever walks
through there...

1457
01:09:17,618 --> 01:09:20,225
will not return to the house
that they just left.

1458
01:09:22,972 --> 01:09:27,394
And I think that we need to find our way
back to our house before the comet passes...

1459
01:09:27,395 --> 01:09:29,729
because we... once it...
once it passes,

1460
01:09:29,730 --> 01:09:31,866
we might just be stuck
exact... here.

1461
01:09:31,867 --> 01:09:33,136
Wherever we are.

1462
01:09:35,136 --> 01:09:38,906
I don't want to be stuck here.

1463
01:09:38,907 --> 01:09:41,175
If your theory is true...

1464
01:09:41,176 --> 01:09:42,943
If we walk through
the dark space,

1465
01:09:42,944 --> 01:09:44,411
and it is a roulette wheel,

1466
01:09:44,412 --> 01:09:46,547
there's no way we can be sure...

1467
01:09:46,548 --> 01:09:51,484
that we would go back
to our original house.

1468
01:09:51,485 --> 01:09:54,188
I think we just stay here.

1469
01:09:54,189 --> 01:09:55,505
I think we're stuck here.

1470
01:09:57,359 --> 01:09:59,861
I put it out near the gate.
Should be all right.

1471
01:09:59,862 --> 01:10:03,229
If we all stay here,
we should be okay.

1472
01:10:03,230 --> 01:10:05,166
Don't open it.

1473
01:10:05,167 --> 01:10:07,837
Who is that?

1474
01:10:08,837 --> 01:10:10,505
Oh.

1475
01:10:10,506 --> 01:10:13,172
- What is it?
- Mike.

1476
01:10:13,173 --> 01:10:16,477
Oh, fuck me.
Oh, jeez.

1477
01:10:16,478 --> 01:10:18,245
"Mike, my friend, What is it?

1478
01:10:18,246 --> 01:10:21,581
Beth plus book
equals Trinidad Club.

1479
01:10:21,582 --> 01:10:23,651
Don't let it happen,
whatever it takes, buddy."

1480
01:10:23,652 --> 01:10:25,920
What is this?

1481
01:10:25,921 --> 01:10:28,089
It's just this note.
It's... Mike had this...

1482
01:10:28,090 --> 01:10:31,258
He had this crazy idea that maybe
if he left this note out there,

1483
01:10:31,259 --> 01:10:32,693
it could stop them
getting the book.

1484
01:10:32,694 --> 01:10:34,394
It's nothing.
It was a stupid idea.

1485
01:10:34,395 --> 01:10:36,596
But our Mike didn't deliver it.
What is this?

1486
01:10:36,597 --> 01:10:38,532
Just some crazy other Mike running around.
It's nothing.

1487
01:10:38,533 --> 01:10:40,767
- You know what it is? What is this?
- We talked about it.

1488
01:10:40,768 --> 01:10:42,469
What is it? Really,
it's nothing.

1489
01:10:42,470 --> 01:10:44,639
- Just let it go, and...
- Then why can't you tell us?

1490
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:46,279
Beth?

1491
01:10:51,279 --> 01:10:53,915
Mike, what is this?
Oh, shit.

1492
01:10:53,916 --> 01:10:56,783
It's...

1493
01:10:56,784 --> 01:10:58,385
Nothing.

1494
01:10:58,386 --> 01:11:00,353
If it's nothing,
then why does my wife...

1495
01:11:00,354 --> 01:11:02,156
have a fucking nosebleed?

1496
01:11:02,157 --> 01:11:05,260
- Oh.
- Oh, honey. Oh, God. Oh, God.

1497
01:11:05,261 --> 01:11:07,161
- Beth, what the hell is this?
- I told you.

1498
01:11:07,162 --> 01:11:09,363
- I told you this was the worst.
- What is the idea?

1499
01:11:09,364 --> 01:11:11,631
12 years ago.
Mike and Beth.

1500
01:11:11,632 --> 01:11:13,533
- You've gotta be kidding me.
- He was gonna blackmail himself...

1501
01:11:13,534 --> 01:11:17,638
- What is this?
- so they would not get the book.

1502
01:11:17,639 --> 01:11:19,773
This is bad.
This is really bad.

1503
01:11:19,774 --> 01:11:23,611
- Wait. You never told Hugh?
- It was on my to-do list.

1504
01:11:23,612 --> 01:11:25,912
We have to just get
through the night, okay?

1505
01:11:25,913 --> 01:11:29,082
Let's just try. He told you.
He said he told you about it.

1506
01:11:29,083 --> 01:11:30,584
Why didn't you tell me?

1507
01:11:30,585 --> 01:11:34,388
- Because you didn't say anything about it.
- Who else knew about this?

1508
01:11:34,389 --> 01:11:36,389
Who else knew about this?

1509
01:11:36,390 --> 01:11:38,925
- Lee, did you know about this?
- Yes.

1510
01:11:38,926 --> 01:11:41,929
- Kevin, did you know?
- He told us. He told you. He...

1511
01:11:41,930 --> 01:11:44,497
- Everybody knew about this.
- We thought you knew.

1512
01:11:44,498 --> 01:11:46,867
Everybody knew about
this except me?

1513
01:11:46,868 --> 01:11:51,904
Hugh, listen. It's...
It's not what it seems. It's...

1514
01:11:51,905 --> 01:11:55,063
- We don't even belong here.
- You are fucking too much, man.

1515
01:11:55,778 --> 01:11:58,778
- You are fucking too much.
- Listen. We're visitors here.

1516
01:11:58,779 --> 01:12:00,714
- This isn't our house.
- What are you talking about?

1517
01:12:00,715 --> 01:12:02,316
This is Lee and Beth's house.

1518
01:12:02,317 --> 01:12:05,586
You sleep with my wife, and
this is what you're telling me?

1519
01:12:05,587 --> 01:12:06,855
Check your phone.
Is your phone broken?

1520
01:12:07,055 --> 01:12:09,188
What the fuck does that
have to do with anything?

1521
01:12:09,189 --> 01:12:12,425
- Is your phone broken?
- What the fuck does that have to do with anything?

1522
01:12:12,426 --> 01:12:15,362
- Just do it.
- Show us.

1523
01:12:15,363 --> 01:12:16,997
No. My phone
is not broken.

1524
01:12:16,998 --> 01:12:19,733
Now what does that have to do
with you sleeping with my wife?

1525
01:12:19,734 --> 01:12:22,569
From the beginning of the
evening, your phone was broken.

1526
01:12:22,570 --> 01:12:24,839
- No. Em's phone is broken.
- So is yours.

1527
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:27,608
Your... The box. The
first box that we got,

1528
01:12:27,609 --> 01:12:29,510
we had, like, a random item.

1529
01:12:29,511 --> 01:12:31,111
W-What w-was
your random item?

1530
01:12:31,112 --> 01:12:33,147
What the fuck does this
have to do with anything?

1531
01:12:33,148 --> 01:12:35,349
Answer him.

1532
01:12:35,350 --> 01:12:38,719
- The stapler.
- No, no, no.

1533
01:12:38,720 --> 01:12:40,420
- What?
- We had an oven mitt.

1534
01:12:40,421 --> 01:12:42,523
And ours was
a ping-pong paddle.

1535
01:12:42,524 --> 01:12:44,858
- What?
- Mine was a napkin.

1536
01:12:44,859 --> 01:12:47,126
What the fuck
are you talking about?

1537
01:12:47,127 --> 01:12:51,131
Hugh, that is not my Lee. That is not
your Beth, and I am not your Mike.

1538
01:12:51,132 --> 01:12:53,067
You... You aren't mad at me.

1539
01:12:53,068 --> 01:12:55,700
W-We're in a different...
a different reality here.

1540
01:12:55,900 --> 01:12:58,841
Yeah, we're in a different reality
because the reality where I am from,

1541
01:12:59,041 --> 01:13:01,608
my best friend didn't
sleep with my wife.

1542
01:13:01,609 --> 01:13:04,510
Hugh, do you not understand
what I'm saying?

1543
01:13:04,511 --> 01:13:09,483
This all started tonight, and if there
are a million different realities,

1544
01:13:09,484 --> 01:13:12,185
I have slept with your wife
in every one of them.

1545
01:13:12,186 --> 01:13:15,456
- You fucking...
- No, no, no.

1546
01:13:15,457 --> 01:13:18,457
Hugh! Hugh!

1547
01:13:19,394 --> 01:13:21,661
Come on!

1548
01:13:21,662 --> 01:13:23,729
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. Settle down.

1549
01:13:23,730 --> 01:13:26,152
I'm gonna get some ice.
I'm gonna get some ice.

1550
01:13:28,168 --> 01:13:30,472
Are you okay?

1551
01:13:31,472 --> 01:13:34,243
Sit down.

1552
01:13:35,243 --> 01:13:36,978
You okay, baby?

1553
01:13:36,979 --> 01:13:39,279
- Here, let me give you a little of this.
- Yeah, yeah.

1554
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:42,649
Okay, I'm going to put something on it.
I'll put something on it.

1555
01:13:44,485 --> 01:13:48,589
You know, I've made some... some
choices, that I'm stuck with. Um...

1556
01:13:48,590 --> 01:13:52,560
I'm stuck here.

1557
01:13:54,429 --> 01:13:57,630
I'm like the dead cat, right?

1558
01:13:57,631 --> 01:13:59,198
This whole night
we've been worrying...

1559
01:13:59,199 --> 01:14:04,604
there's some dark version of us
out there somewhere.

1560
01:14:04,605 --> 01:14:06,310
What if we're the dark version?

1561
01:14:08,310 --> 01:14:10,310
What's that?

1562
01:14:10,378 --> 01:14:12,446
- All right.
- Goddamn it!

1563
01:14:12,447 --> 01:14:15,447
Why didn't you tell me?

1564
01:14:20,221 --> 01:14:22,755
There's someone in the house.

1565
01:14:22,756 --> 01:14:24,858
Get the hell outta here!

1566
01:14:24,859 --> 01:14:28,362
- Oh. No, no, no, no, no.
- Jesus. What's going on?

1567
01:14:28,363 --> 01:14:29,962
- Is he all right?
- Are you okay?

1568
01:14:29,963 --> 01:14:32,733
- Who the fuck was that?
- Mike? Mike?

1569
01:14:32,734 --> 01:14:35,702
Does anybody know what to do?

1570
01:14:35,703 --> 01:14:37,804
- Mike?
- Is he breathing?

1571
01:14:37,805 --> 01:14:41,242
- Jesus Christ!
- Laurie, it's okay.

1572
01:14:42,743 --> 01:14:44,946
- Calm down.
- Laurie, Laurie, stop.

1573
01:14:44,947 --> 01:14:48,348
Laurie, Jesus.

1574
01:14:48,349 --> 01:14:51,285
- Shh.
- Kevin, shut her the fuck up.

1575
01:14:51,286 --> 01:14:52,919
It's okay, Laurie.

1576
01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:55,255
Just breathe. You're all right.
You're all right.

1577
01:14:55,256 --> 01:14:58,626
Em. Em.

1578
01:14:58,627 --> 01:15:00,662
Em, where are you going?

1579
01:15:03,064 --> 01:15:06,899
Just calm down.
It's all right.

1580
01:15:06,900 --> 01:15:10,571
- Get off me!
- Get a rag. Get a towel. Anything.

1581
01:15:10,572 --> 01:15:12,371
- Here, here, here, here.
- Get it off!

1582
01:15:12,372 --> 01:15:15,408
- Get it off! I can't fucking stand blood.
- Okay. It's off.

1583
01:15:15,409 --> 01:15:17,199
It'll be all right.
Just calm down.

1584
01:16:09,296 --> 01:16:12,633
Get the fuck away.
Get the fuck away.

1585
01:16:12,634 --> 01:16:14,740
You're scaring the shit
out of everybody.

1586
01:16:16,171 --> 01:16:20,728
Who are you? Who are
you fucking people?

1587
01:16:39,728 --> 01:16:41,728
And you said... All
you guys are crazy.

1588
01:16:41,729 --> 01:16:44,766
You were always fucking crazy.

1589
01:16:45,766 --> 01:16:47,334
She's bad news.

1590
01:16:47,335 --> 01:16:49,546
It's been years we
haven't seen each other.

1591
01:17:25,273 --> 01:17:28,308
You know, Vietnamese
is a pitch-based language.

1592
01:17:28,309 --> 01:17:31,813
D.H.R. Yeah.

1593
01:17:34,215 --> 01:17:37,720
It really is
a pitch-based language.

1594
01:17:39,720 --> 01:17:42,723
- Hi.
- Hi.

1595
01:17:42,724 --> 01:17:44,650
Cheers.

1596
01:18:17,658 --> 01:18:19,559
And I don't think
I'm working a lot.

1597
01:18:19,560 --> 01:18:24,630
I have to work a lot, but
it's gonna be a nice balance.

1598
01:18:24,631 --> 01:18:28,702
What are you gonna do while he's working?
What are you gonna do?

1599
01:18:28,703 --> 01:18:30,504
I don't know.
Just hang out.

1600
01:18:30,505 --> 01:18:31,865
- Investigate?
- Yeah, investigate.

1601
01:18:32,006 --> 01:18:34,308
Fundraise. Get those
Vietnamese to invest in...

1602
01:18:34,309 --> 01:18:38,411
- Fundraise in San Francisco.
- Invest in the Vietnamese.

1603
01:18:38,412 --> 01:18:41,380
- It's supposed to be gorgeous, though.
- This time of year.

1604
01:18:41,381 --> 01:18:43,716
My cousin lived over there
for about a year...

1605
01:18:43,717 --> 01:18:45,251
and said it was
just spectacular.

1606
01:18:45,252 --> 01:18:49,656
- Have you been there before?
- No. Not Vietnam. Cambodia.

1607
01:18:49,657 --> 01:18:51,191
Cambodia was awesome.

1608
01:18:51,192 --> 01:18:52,860
Did you see Angkor Wat
when you were in Cambodia?

1609
01:18:53,060 --> 01:18:54,695
- Yeah.
- Good times.

1610
01:18:57,899 --> 01:18:59,634
Great.

1611
01:19:01,302 --> 01:19:03,302
Picture this.

1612
01:19:03,502 --> 01:19:05,605
- Whoa. What the hell was that?
- What was that?

1613
01:19:05,606 --> 01:19:08,175
- It was like a car window, or something.
- It sounded like glass.

1614
01:19:08,176 --> 01:19:09,703
It sounded like a windshield.

1615
01:19:10,011 --> 01:19:11,577
That's mine.
That's mine.

1616
01:19:11,578 --> 01:19:13,779
Should we get the, the
glowsticks to take outside?

1617
01:19:13,780 --> 01:19:15,282
We're not going to a rave.

1618
01:19:15,283 --> 01:19:18,117
You want to go to a rave,
party man?

1619
01:19:18,118 --> 01:19:20,353
I don't see anybody.

1620
01:19:20,354 --> 01:19:22,288
You okay?

1621
01:19:22,289 --> 01:19:25,725
- Whose is that right there?
- Oh, for fuck's sake. Seriously?

1622
01:19:25,726 --> 01:19:29,395
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, baby.

1623
01:19:29,396 --> 01:19:32,700
- I just got this. I just got this.
- I'm sorry.

1624
01:19:32,701 --> 01:19:35,368
There's no structural damage.

1625
01:19:35,369 --> 01:19:37,838
- Did they take anything?
- They didn't take my fucking...

1626
01:19:38,038 --> 01:19:40,206
- They didn't take my stereo.
- Come on.

1627
01:19:40,207 --> 01:19:43,443
Why don't we check
the rest of our cars,

1628
01:19:43,444 --> 01:19:44,911
and see what's going on.

1629
01:19:44,912 --> 01:19:46,545
- Yeah.
- Honey, where's our car?

1630
01:19:46,546 --> 01:19:48,447
- In the driveway.
- All right.

1631
01:19:48,448 --> 01:19:52,421
- Em, you good?
- Yeah. I'm right up here.

1632
01:20:35,729 --> 01:20:38,098
- Hey.
- Hey.

1633
01:20:38,099 --> 01:20:40,701
What are you doing?
We... Guys, she's in here.

1634
01:20:40,702 --> 01:20:42,234
We were looking for you.

1635
01:20:42,235 --> 01:20:45,839
- Oh, I was just, um, by my car.
- Oh.

1636
01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:49,977
- You okay, babe?
- Yeah, I just... Yeah.

1637
01:20:49,978 --> 01:20:52,478
- You got away from us.
- I did.

1638
01:20:52,479 --> 01:20:55,349
I guess worse things could
happen at a dinner party.

1639
01:20:55,350 --> 01:20:57,349
I went and got the...
the ring.

1640
01:20:57,350 --> 01:21:00,853
No, I could stay here.
That's a good idea.

1641
01:21:00,854 --> 01:21:03,157
What were you doing out there?

1642
01:21:03,158 --> 01:21:07,160
Em. What were you doing
out there?

1643
01:21:07,161 --> 01:21:10,296
Um, the view is really beautiful
of the comet out there.

1644
01:21:10,297 --> 01:21:12,931
- Oh.
- You came in that door?

1645
01:21:12,932 --> 01:21:15,535
- Yeah.
- What's wrong with that door?

1646
01:21:15,536 --> 01:21:18,006
That's the door to nowhere.
Don't you know?

1647
01:21:18,606 --> 01:21:20,907
Okay. Let's go take a look.
Let's check it out.

1648
01:21:20,908 --> 01:21:24,908
Everybody's sick of hearing
about the feng shui.

1649
01:21:25,012 --> 01:21:28,081
- God, it's freezing outside.
- Come on.

1650
01:21:28,082 --> 01:21:30,750
You mentioned it.
Let's look at it.

1651
01:21:30,751 --> 01:21:32,719
How come
we never use this patio?

1652
01:21:32,720 --> 01:21:34,487
Well, we never have comets.

1653
01:21:34,488 --> 01:21:37,657
Oh, my God.

1654
01:21:37,658 --> 01:21:39,459
W-What's it doing?

1655
01:21:39,460 --> 01:21:41,495
It's breaking up.

1656
01:21:41,496 --> 01:21:43,764
- Is that what they do?
- Yeah, I guess so.

1657
01:21:43,765 --> 01:21:47,067
So, Em, is Katherine Meriss gonna understudy
your life while you're gone for a month?

1658
01:21:47,068 --> 01:21:48,903
Oh, no one can.
Ooh.

1659
01:21:50,637 --> 01:21:53,608
- I like that.
- Oh, come on.

1660
01:21:56,844 --> 01:21:59,278
I wish we could roast
marshmallows on that meteor.

1661
01:21:59,279 --> 01:22:01,439
A long stick.

1662
01:22:50,898 --> 01:22:52,732
Yeah?

1663
01:22:52,733 --> 01:22:54,667
- Em? You okay?
- Yeah?

1664
01:22:54,668 --> 01:22:57,336
Yeah, I'm fine.
The toilet just got backed up.

1665
01:22:57,337 --> 01:23:00,172
You can't use that one. You
gotta use the main one, okay?

1666
01:23:00,173 --> 01:23:02,908
Okay.
I'll be right out.

1667
01:23:46,854 --> 01:23:49,462
- Oh, my God.
- Em. Em.

1668
01:24:40,542 --> 01:24:43,210
Hey. You're up.

1669
01:24:43,211 --> 01:24:46,926
I'll make some breakfast. It'll
be ready in, like, five minutes.

1670
01:25:07,902 --> 01:25:10,202
Oh, hi.
You feeling better?

1671
01:25:10,203 --> 01:25:12,304
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1672
01:25:12,305 --> 01:25:14,216
I'm gonna get dressed.
I'll be back.

1673
01:25:48,009 --> 01:25:51,211
Morning.

1674
01:25:51,212 --> 01:25:53,580
You okay, babe?

1675
01:25:53,581 --> 01:25:56,349
Are you okay?

1676
01:25:56,350 --> 01:25:58,854
You totally passed out
last night.

1677
01:26:00,854 --> 01:26:04,590
You were mumbling.
I put you on the couch.

1678
01:26:04,591 --> 01:26:06,996
Found that in the bathroom.

1679
01:26:14,402 --> 01:26:17,539
That's weird.
It's you calling me.

1680
01:26:19,539 --> 01:26:21,442
