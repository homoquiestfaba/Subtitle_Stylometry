crazy and all, but--

535
00:30:22,433 --> 00:30:24,667
No, I know you're crazy,
but I still like you.

536
00:30:24,667 --> 00:30:26,533
Okay.

537
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:27,900
Yeah, okay.

538
00:30:32,581 --> 00:30:34,200
Here you go, sir!

539
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,733
All right, listen up!

540
00:30:35,733 --> 00:30:37,567
We gotta fire the cannons
all at once.

541
00:30:37,567 --> 00:30:39,400
We gotta time 'em
with a lightning strike.

542
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,733
If we do that,

543
00:30:40,733 --> 00:30:42,033
all the cannonballs
will become electrified

544
00:30:42,033 --> 00:30:43,767
and will go into the Sharknado,

545
00:30:43,767 --> 00:30:45,567
and it'll blow up
all the sharks.

546
00:30:50,133 --> 00:30:52,533
Look, I've faced down

547
00:30:52,533 --> 00:30:54,967
more of these Sharknados
than I care to remember.

548
00:30:54,967 --> 00:30:56,633
There's no time
to stop and think

549
00:30:56,633 --> 00:30:59,467
about the madness of it all.
You just have to do it.

550
00:30:59,467 --> 00:31:01,800
We're not fighting
for just our country.

551
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:04,067
We're fighting
for all of humanity.

552
00:31:04,067 --> 00:31:05,533
Now who's with me?!

553
00:31:11,333 --> 00:31:12,733
Just load the cannons!

554
00:31:12,733 --> 00:31:14,967
Ready the cannons!

555
00:31:14,967 --> 00:31:16,967
Aim!

556
00:31:16,967 --> 00:31:18,267
Fire!

557
00:31:18,267 --> 00:31:19,567
Oh, God.

00:31:19,567 --> 00:31:21,167
Hiya! [ yelps ]

559
00:31:23,167 --> 00:31:25,200
It's a full count,
bottom of the ninth.

All right, locked
and loaded!

565
00:32:10,467 --> 00:32:12,900
God bless America.

566
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,700
The British are retreating.

567
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:22,333
Suck it, you redcoat ninnies!

568
00:32:22,333 --> 00:32:23,833
Where's Nova?

569
00:32:23,833 --> 00:32:25,867
She was walking into town
with Private Clarke.

570
00:32:25,867 --> 00:32:27,967
Drinks for all.
Drinks for all.

571
00:32:27,967 --> 00:32:30,233
You two figure out how
to get us some speed.

572
00:32:30,233 --> 00:32:32,533
I'll be right back.

573
00:32:32,533 --> 00:32:34,633
Here you go.
Thank you so much.

574
00:32:34,633 --> 00:32:35,633
I really appreciate it.

575
00:32:35,633 --> 00:32:36,833
Thank you.

576
00:32:36,833 --> 00:32:38,500
Take care of it.

577
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:39,379
That was weird.

578
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,867
Hold up.
I'll take this from here.

579
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,700
Great job today.

580
00:32:48,733 --> 00:32:51,433
Let me buy you a drink,
Private Shepard.

581
00:32:54,233 --> 00:32:55,533
Get the tents rolled up.

582
00:32:56,392 --> 00:32:58,367
- I have a ride for you.
- Whoa!

583
00:32:58,367 --> 00:33:01,567
It's not safe for these horses
to come through the portal.

584
00:33:01,567 --> 00:33:05,367
But I have something
much more powerful in mind.

585
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:09,700
Any chance this is a letter
to your grandfather?

586
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:11,740
Yeah, as a matter of fact,
there is.

587
00:33:13,158 --> 00:33:15,167
- Do you want to read it, Fin?
- Yeah.

588
00:33:19,133 --> 00:33:22,533
[ sighs ] You're warning him
not to go fishing.

589
00:33:22,533 --> 00:33:24,367
If he doesn't go to the sea,

590
00:33:24,367 --> 00:33:26,900
there's no way that shark
will kill him. He'll stay alive.

591
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:28,567
And you stop fighting sharks,

592
00:33:28,567 --> 00:33:30,633
you don't start
the Sharknado Sisterhood,

593
00:33:30,633 --> 00:33:32,733
and you don't save me
or my family.

594
00:33:32,733 --> 00:33:36,033
Know what, Fin? It's time
I save my own family, okay?

595
00:33:36,473 --> 00:33:38,567
And by the way,
he might not even get this note.

596
00:33:38,567 --> 00:33:41,100
He's not gonna be born
for two more centuries,
but I had to try.

597
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:45,467
No. We can't mess
with destiny.

598
00:33:45,467 --> 00:33:47,200
M-Mess with destiny?

599
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,633
We just fought
in the American Revolution.

600
00:33:49,633 --> 00:33:51,667
It looks like we're messing
with destiny to me.

601
00:33:51,667 --> 00:33:53,067
No, we stopped history
from changing

602
00:33:53,067 --> 00:33:54,333
by stopping a Sharknado

603
00:33:54,333 --> 00:33:56,233
so things could stay
the way they are.

604
00:33:56,233 --> 00:33:58,578
Your grandfather
didn't die in a Sharknado.

605
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:03,133
We can't change his fate.

606
00:34:03,133 --> 00:34:05,633
Next time we jump,
I might not exist.

607
00:34:05,633 --> 00:34:08,133
And what are the odds
that I ran into my ancestor?

608
00:34:08,133 --> 00:34:10,133
I'll never get
this chance again.

609
00:34:10,133 --> 00:34:12,600
My grandfather raised me,

610
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,900
and I was never the same
after he died,

611
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:17,967
so I would give anything
to have one more day with him.

612
00:34:17,967 --> 00:34:19,933
I'm sorry, Nova. We can't.

I'm sorry.

You know what, Fin? I'm sorry.

616
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,613
You can't control me, and you
won't control my destiny.

617
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:46,933
I just know
that the energy bolt

618
00:34:46,933 --> 00:34:49,367
is more powerful
than anything else we have,

619
00:34:49,367 --> 00:34:51,267
but I just cannot grab it.

620
00:34:51,267 --> 00:34:53,033
I know what the problem is.

621
00:34:53,764 --> 00:34:54,833
What we're missing...

622
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:57,600

In you go. In you go. Hello.

You see, this is why

You're always ready
to run in there

the next Sharknado,

and I just get tired.

Fin, last time I jumped,
I wasn't exactly me.

I can't take
that chance anymore.
