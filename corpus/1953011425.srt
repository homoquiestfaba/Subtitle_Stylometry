A
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:51,040
Balance, Will.
Feet shoulder width apart.

2
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:54,600
If you beweegd, you slide.
You make no steps.

3
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:56,840
Sword up.
Elbows inside.

4
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,560
This is the center position.

5
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,560
Now you fall on me.

6
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,560
Remember, Will, knights honor.

7
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:19,400
- Others not usually.
- I almost did.

8
00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:22,400
Almost another word for death,
boy.

9
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,880
I'll check the traps.
Bring the sheep to the south pasture.

10
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:30,520
Soapwort is growing on the ridge.
Maybe Crow an antidote.

11
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:35,080
We need a good warp
the winter, to endure.

12
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,000
- Drink this for pain.
- Thank you, Crow.

13
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:26,360
We can forget that wool.
Soapwort is growing everywhere.

14
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,760
- Hey, Crow.
- Good evening.

15
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,480
You have probably no cure for soapwort?

16
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:33,880
If I had, I was rich.

17
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,400
Maybe the secret is in you, Will.

18
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,920
What hebje that magic of yours
if you can not even?

19
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:43,080
We'll see how bad it is.

20
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:46,680
- It will hardly be enough for socks.
- Then we slaughter.

21
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,760
Another thing:
There are four sheep along the river.

22
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,840
Completely torn.

23
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:56,640
That was fixed back dog.

24
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:06,200
You must leave this mountain, Will.
- What?

25
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,640
You have no future here.

26
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:13,240
You have a gift
and that you squandered as a farmer.

27
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,120
There's a man on behalf of Sterling.
Give it to him.

28
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:20,360
- A low lander?
- Give him this.

29
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:23,240
He will record as a vassal.

30
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,840
He's a baron.

31
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:30,040
By the plague, he has lost
from all others.

32
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:33,360
But he is smart and will favor
the new king to win.

33
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:35,000
As you can benefit.

34
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:37,800
That's your future,
that you understand.

35
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:42,760
Here I build my own future,
just like you and Crow.

36
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,520
I am your father.
You're still a child ...

37
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:48,200
- Will!
- Let him go, Tom.

38
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,040
He's a proud guy. Like you.

39
00:05:56,839 --> 00:05:58,880
You've waited a long time.

40
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:04,360
Some things you should
leave to your descendants.

41
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,520
Will, go to the north pasture
and check the traps.

42
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:41,000
Hebje hear me?

43
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,040
Father!

44
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,240
We lack even half dozen.

45
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:00,400
That was not a wolf.
It's bigger.

46
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,240
Maybe a bear.

47
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,280
A dragon.

48
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:24,960
We have here
20 years no dragon seen.

49
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,160
What a disaster.
The province will perish.

50
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,240
There is no animal on.

51
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:33,640
- The dragon must have a nest.
Yes. Within a radius of 100 miles.

52
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,000
- She does not kill to eat.
- So?

53
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,280
She defends her territory.
The nest can not be far.

54
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:41,840
A dragon
is worth 1000 gold pieces.

55
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,240
- How do you know it's a vroumje?
- Here we come back.

56
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:47,840
We must
The rest of the herd care.

57
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
We urge her to
and observing the nest.

58
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:54,040
We steal the egg
while sheep kills.

59
00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:56,600
1000 gold pieces
are enough for a lifetime.

60
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,800
You seem really opje mother.

61
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,320
God help me.

62
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,240
I would be
If I could fly.

63
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,880
You should look here!

64
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,400
Her litter
this should be close.

65
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,240
Without wings
You do not get.

66
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:09,960
Because you get old!

67
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:13,240
Yes, and I'm still alive,
because I never rock climb.

68
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:15,400
I do not want to die ignorant.

69
00:11:10,039 --> 00:11:11,320
No!

70
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:09,960
The situation is worse than he admitted.

71
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,720
You'll have to sell.
- Never.

72
00:12:13,879 --> 00:12:16,000
I will find the dragon.

73
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:20,120
I'm off again tomorrow,
find the nest and kill the dragon.

74
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,600
Are you crazy? No man
can kill a dragon.

75
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:26,240
Superstition.
It's only an animal?

76
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:29,160
Pack your bags tomorrow.

77
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:32,560
- And are you employed by Sterling.
- No.

78
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,160
Your time here is over.

79
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:39,600
Be a loyal vassal
and lets you dub.

80
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,240
That was the wish of your father.

81
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,440
The talisman of a knight.
Passed in my order.

82
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:03,840
I am the last of our
and will not live to see fights.

83
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,120
Imbued with the prayers
thousands of gods.

84
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:10,800
He protects
to him who wears it.

85
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,480
You do not believe
In that sort of thing.

86
00:13:13,639 --> 00:13:16,720
But remember:
We are a mountain people.

87
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,360
We carry a force within us.

88
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:21,600
Thank you, Crow.

89
00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:11,120
Excuse me.

90
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,560
I said excuse me.

91
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:17,640
What is it?
Are your sheep run away?

92
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,320
Yes, they were overwrought.

93
00:15:21,159 --> 00:15:23,560
I want to go to the castle
baron of Sterling.

94
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,680
About four miles further
on the left.

95
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:31,000
Spaarje the trouble, man.
He claims no one.

96
00:15:31,159 --> 00:15:33,360
And certainly not someone like you.

97
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:37,040
Thank you.
But further toil, kitchen boys.

98
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:41,360
Go back to thee hills, shepherd.

99
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:44,240
My dog ??has your mother
jumped four times.

100
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,640
And you said the dog was better.

101
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:45,040
Look.

102
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:50,080
What are you doing?

103
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:53,720
J Excuse but there is need for precision.

104
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:10,000
To see your hands,
you are a sorceress.

105
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,960
I am not,
brutal flail.

106
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,880
Hopefully you expect no reward.
Rather go on.

107
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:21,720
As a reward
can a traveler the way.

108
00:17:22,039 --> 00:17:24,920
- Where are you going?
- Sterling Manor.

109
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:28,200
- Then Gaje in the wrong direction.
- What?

110
00:17:28,519 --> 00:17:31,640
You had two miles ago
west to go.

111
00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:34,080
What? The liars ...

112
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:45,760
- Thanks voorje help, boy.
- I'm not uwjongen.

113
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,160
Are you lost, mountaineer?

114
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,560
- Where is Sterling?
- Why do you want him?

115
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:16,840
That's just something about Sterling.

116
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,440
He is in his chambers. There are
no servants to show you the way.

117
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:26,000
Not living in any case.
There has been too poor for the baron.

118
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:30,760
But beware, the last mountain dwellers
who came here

119
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,280
He has driven away with a whip.

120
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,680
The Baron does not like heikneuters.

121
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:56,880
I do not want your toils
as a farmer.

122
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:59,400
Who else should do the job,
father?

123
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,440
Our people are dead or fled.
We have almost nothing.

124
00:20:04,759 --> 00:20:07,120
Sam and the others
working in the fields.

125
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,760
I let my country is not negligible.

126
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:12,440
The nuns would make you a lady.

127
00:20:12,759 --> 00:20:15,280
- A lady?
- That was a waste of money.

128
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,600
Who now married with a devil?

129
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:22,960
Do you want the property would cause
when I'm gone?

130
00:20:24,039 --> 00:20:26,680
The king wants to fill his coffers.

131
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,440
They will kill you and no heir
this land of the king.

132
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:34,480
No man need me to tell
what to do.

133
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:38,880
- Lord Sterling?
- How did you get here?

134
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,840
That's the man
of whom I have told you.

135
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,160
We have no need. Get out!

136
00:20:44,319 --> 00:20:46,920
Ask Sam in the stables
something to eat.

137
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:49,960
Tonight you can sleep there,
but tomorrow you should go.

138
00:20:50,119 --> 00:20:52,480
I Will Shepherd.
I want to serve as a vassal.

139
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,440
I do not need vassals.
Go away.

140
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,880
I must give you this.

141
00:21:14,119 --> 00:21:16,200
Kate, let us alone.

142
00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:20,240
But let me
do some embroidery, right dad?

143
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,120
Shepherd, did you?

144
00:21:28,519 --> 00:21:31,640
- Do you know what this letter says?
- No, sir.

145
00:21:32,839 --> 00:21:35,600
You come from the mountains.
Are you a magician?

146
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,440
- No.
- I tolerate no magic.

147
00:21:38,599 --> 00:21:40,560
- Got it?
Yes, sir.

148
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,320
- Can you ride?
Yes.

149
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,520
- A helpful guy, huh?
- I'm trying.

150
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:48,240
At least when it comes to walls.

151
00:21:49,079 --> 00:21:51,800
You can continue temporarily.

152
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:54,320
Sam will work to give you tomorrow.

153
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,280
Thank you, sir.

154
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,880
Check it out. One, two ...

155
00:22:21,559 --> 00:22:23,800
Still lost, boy?

156
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:28,600
- The pig was there.
- It looks like it.

157
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:33,600
Sterling tells me that you
a mattress and work can give.

158
00:22:33,759 --> 00:22:35,880
What a pity now.

159
00:22:36,039 --> 00:22:38,400
Those two hate heikneuters.

160
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:41,480
You can sleep better somewhere else.

161
00:22:42,359 --> 00:22:43,920
I do take it.

162
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,080
- Are you deaf?
- Do sit down, Sam.

163
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,400
Save that for tomorrow only.

164
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:11,160
Keep it up!
Fine rooting in the mud, boy!

165
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,800
What are you doing here?

166
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,720
I was!

167
00:25:01,519 --> 00:25:04,360
Give it here.
Do not look. Turn around.

168
00:25:06,359 --> 00:25:09,120
You looked at me.
- To indicate that shirt.

169
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:11,560
- No, I mean that.
- No.

170
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,640
Although ... yes. No.

171
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:16,360
I did not
you took a bath here.

172
00:25:16,519 --> 00:25:18,960
Oh, the darling of my father's shirt.

173
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:21,040
Stay're not just standing.

174
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:25,320
So you want to
a vassal of my father?

175
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:28,360
Yes.
- And where is your family?

176
00:25:29,599 --> 00:25:30,600
Death.

177
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,560
My mother died when I was little
and my father recently.

178
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:40,200
I'm sorry. How did he die?

179
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,640
By a dragon.

180
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:48,480
I thought
that no longer existed.

181
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:54,760
You thought I was a sorceress.
- I saw your ring.

182
00:25:55,079 --> 00:25:57,640
I have magical symbol
seen before.

183
00:25:57,799 --> 00:26:01,120
- Sorcery is your specialty.
- Not mine.

184
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:03,160
What was in that letter?

185
00:26:03,319 --> 00:26:05,920
- That was not for me.
- Of course.

186
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,440
Father has farmers need
no vassals.

187
00:26:08,599 --> 00:26:11,800
He will only plow
and learn to obey.

188
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:18,240
Why is the fire in the house?
We have guests?

189
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:22,040
- I'm not here to be a farmer.
- Take the basket with you?

190
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,880
- How far are you driving?
- A few hundred miles.

191
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:35,000
- Good trip?
Yes. Very good.

192
00:26:35,319 --> 00:26:39,120
- You have a new horse?
Yes. A particularly noble breed.

193
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,600
Rogan, it's good to see you.

194
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,760
The pleasure is mutual.

195
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:59,280
Heaven, you are truly blossomed.

196
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,600
Your daughter has grown
to a beautiful peach

197
00:27:02,759 --> 00:27:04,680
needed to be picked.

198
00:27:04,839 --> 00:27:07,640
I will only take
chaste as a compliment.

199
00:27:07,799 --> 00:27:10,600
- You're too good.
- I think so.

200
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,680
You arrive just in time.

201
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,120
My cousin,
widow Lady Spriggs, arrives today.

202
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:19,840
- You know that old rod anyway?
- Father!

203
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,800
Why does it express
the truth

204
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,920
always turn to violent protest?

205
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,840
Eleanor will be happy to see you.

206
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,160
Perhaps this leads
her attention from me.

207
00:27:44,599 --> 00:27:46,960
What is the situation in Sterling Manor?

208
00:27:50,599 --> 00:27:54,880
- Good. We expand the fields out.
- The weed spreads.

209
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:59,240
Guests are not blind you, Robert.
Your estate is a rurne.

210
00:27:59,559 --> 00:28:01,240
We'll be fine.

211
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:06,480
Owen viceroy soon we will certainly
back to the crown in favor of the stand.

212
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:11,520
Tell us, Sir Rogan, you are still
the favorite at every tournament?

213
00:28:12,039 --> 00:28:15,640
I have not
found equal opponent.

214
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:18,760
The ladies should cover your feet.

215
00:28:19,079 --> 00:28:21,960
Which game form
the court is currently popular?

216
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:25,600
The King
would prefer two opponents

217
00:28:25,759 --> 00:28:27,960
with a rope attached.

218
00:28:28,279 --> 00:28:30,120
The first to fall loses.

219
00:28:30,279 --> 00:28:32,160
I'm still unconquered.

220
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:36,600
Great. Pity
game that your days are over.

221
00:28:36,759 --> 00:28:39,320
I'd like you
seen in the game.

222
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:44,520
A man like the Baron has established
a more interesting pastime.

223
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,920
What brings you here, Rogan?

224
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,440
An invitation.

225
00:28:51,759 --> 00:28:55,160
I want you to come along with me
counsel to the knight.

226
00:28:55,319 --> 00:28:57,800
In the highlands
A yard burned.

227
00:28:58,119 --> 00:29:00,440
The family was found
scattered in the area.

228
00:29:00,599 --> 00:29:04,920
It seems
a dragon that destroyed our country.

229
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:09,000
- Horrible.
- Nonsense. Wolves that are fixed.

230
00:29:09,319 --> 00:29:11,160
I have to stir the fire.

231
00:29:11,319 --> 00:29:15,760
These mountain people lie to the people
the money from their pocket to store.

232
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:18,640
Your prejudice is misplaced.

233
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:22,160
It is about 14 days ago

234
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:26,160
I woke up from
a terrible roar.

235
00:29:26,319 --> 00:29:29,800
I went to the window,
but there was nothing to see.

236
00:29:30,119 --> 00:29:33,080
Exactly.
Because it was imagination.

237
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:37,160
And now you think
these stupid rumors

238
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:40,480
proof
voorje figments.

239
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:44,360
And yet I continue to Kate,
as long as you're on the board.

240
00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:46,280
Will has seen him.

241
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,720
- As seen baby?
- The dragon.

242
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,240
- Nonsense.
- I believe he speaks the truth.

243
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,120
Tell him, Will.

244
00:30:01,799 --> 00:30:04,200
- Well?
- It's true, sir.

245
00:30:04,519 --> 00:30:06,160
I knew it.

246
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,080
The Board will decide
what we do with that beast.

247
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,760
Most will want to wait.

248
00:30:12,079 --> 00:30:15,400
Cowards. He's probably not that big
as the myths say.

249
00:30:15,559 --> 00:30:19,320
He is at least 40 feet long and
twice as wide as the wings.

250
00:30:20,039 --> 00:30:23,760
If you are going to consider
a solution, take that boy with you.

251
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,480
He saw it.

252
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:28,400
- How far were you from?
- Very close.

253
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:32,320
No one comes close to a dragon
without dying.

254
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:36,280
Unless you are able
to kill the dragon.

255
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:39,240
- Beweerje that?
- No, sir.

256
00:30:40,279 --> 00:30:42,520
But it is my intention.

257
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,160
Dragons are in the myth
slain by knights.

258
00:30:48,319 --> 00:30:50,800
Loopjij also by fire, boy?

259
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,000
No, sir.

260
00:30:56,079 --> 00:30:59,560
You will be beaten down to Knight
if you kill the beast.

261
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:03,760
Moreover, the whole kingdom
you celebrate.

262
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,440
A true Paladin.

263
00:31:07,759 --> 00:31:11,760
But we now have an opponent
for you, Rogan.

264
00:31:12,599 --> 00:31:15,800
- Excuse me?
- For a demonstration game.

265
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:21,000
He is only a servant, Milady,
and not practiced.

266
00:31:21,319 --> 00:31:25,240
But he is strong. I predict
a surprising victory.

267
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,760
Madame, you insult me.

268
00:31:30,319 --> 00:31:32,960
I bet the boy.

269
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:37,440
You're a crafty lady.

270
00:31:38,599 --> 00:31:40,320
I'm going to bet.

271
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,960
Keep it simple and try
not hurt.

272
00:32:04,079 --> 00:32:07,680
I assume that the fighting
the court a little longer.

273
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:14,960
- Satisfied?
- It was his first attempt.

274
00:32:15,119 --> 00:32:17,320
Double or nothing.

275
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,720
More beatings, boy?

276
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,760
That's what we do not
if it is a cousin.

277
00:32:26,079 --> 00:32:28,680
Note opje words
to your superiors.

278
00:32:28,839 --> 00:32:32,240
No, forget it.
I do like temperament.

279
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,680
I know what I neersla.

280
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:31,640
Thank you,
You had a very lucrative opponent.

281
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:37,720
Do not be ungrateful.
Show your appreciation.

282
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:44,840
My lord. I'm sorry
I've disappointed you.

283
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:50,120
It was very entertaining.
We go inside, Rogan. Come.

284
00:33:58,119 --> 00:34:00,280
Your new servant is entertaining.

285
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:04,320
His idea to kill the dragon
is certainly enticing.

286
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:09,600
With weapons and cunning to
brave men kill a dragon.

287
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:14,440
That sounds very modern.
I do feel the same way, Sterling.

288
00:34:14,599 --> 00:34:17,080
I can make good use
ally with the board.

289
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:21,560
Your daughter is really
a charming young lady.

290
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:25,280
I am looking
a wife, Sterling.

291
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:29,640
- What do you think?
- That is very generous, Baron.

292
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:32,360
But I am poor.
She has no dowry.

293
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:35,920
If I wanted gold, I the daughter
a money changer married.

294
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:40,640
Give me uwwestelijke lands.
These lie fallow anyway.

295
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,560
The rest I yard after your death.

296
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:45,800
A good match for your daughter

297
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:49,920
and I guarantee that the crown
You will be well disposed.

298
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,240
A tempting offer, Rogan.

299
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:58,200
But my country in the south
has been intended for someone else.

300
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,920
Who?

301
00:35:01,519 --> 00:35:03,640
The servant. Will Shepherd.

302
00:35:05,639 --> 00:35:08,360
- But he knows it yet.
- A bastard?

303
00:35:08,519 --> 00:35:10,960
No. Nothing of the sort.

304
00:35:12,119 --> 00:35:14,680
A very old agreement.

305
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:17,760
If he does not know
and furthermore no one ...

306
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,920
Tell him.
I will certainly not do so.

307
00:35:23,199 --> 00:35:27,160
That was a bad move, Sterling.
This is not your nature.

308
00:35:27,719 --> 00:35:31,960
I did not know that punches
with a rope game allowed.

309
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,400
I've changed, not him.

310
00:35:35,559 --> 00:35:37,240
Are we agreed?

311
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,960
You can give me what you want.

312
00:35:40,119 --> 00:35:43,200
It will not be easy
to convince her.

313
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,280
You are too lenient.

314
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,080
A daughter, the good advice
her father to speak.

315
00:36:27,039 --> 00:36:29,840
Lady, I must say Spriggs
that Rogan might be an idiot,

316
00:36:30,159 --> 00:36:32,840
but that its currency
still has value.

317
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:42,080
I dried meat voorje
brought. And this.

318
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:45,560
The livery of my father.

319
00:36:45,719 --> 00:36:49,440
I could not find the same
between the old stuff,

320
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:51,320
but here it is.

321
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:54,880
Gold stands for ambition
and brown for patience.

322
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:58,040
The latter I have enough,
I'm afraid.

323
00:36:58,199 --> 00:37:00,880
But these are
the colors of my father.

324
00:37:01,679 --> 00:37:05,360
I thought as his vassal to them
perhaps in the Council.

325
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,480
Only look at.

326
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:02,720
So. Very stately.

327
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,800
- I ...
- I just wanted ...

328
00:38:07,519 --> 00:38:10,200
I still have a lot to prepare.

329
00:38:36,679 --> 00:38:38,640
Hey, guys!

330
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,720
Here comes the champion.

331
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:47,080
You have him poepie
to smell, eh?

332
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,920
Hey. What is that?

333
00:38:53,679 --> 00:38:57,520
We need to bed early.
The baron has need us tomorrow.

334
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:01,840
Maarjij does not count.

335
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:04,480
The Baron wants you to stay here.

336
00:39:04,639 --> 00:39:08,120
You must clean up manure.
What a pity now.

337
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:12,560
Maybe you had a few of us
You can learn sword tricks.

338
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:18,080
Remember
the pigs.

339
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:22,240
- And to do laundry.
- Where is he?

340
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:25,960
- What?
- My dagger.

341
00:39:26,119 --> 00:39:27,960
I do not know what you mean.

342
00:39:28,119 --> 00:39:30,640
Beweerje sometimes
I'm a thief?

343
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,280
You're worse than a thief.

344
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,800
Just ask your little lady.

345
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:39,560
She needs a man,
not a boy like you.

346
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:44,080
I'm just eager
my hands wet

347
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:47,680
when it comes to
that is kind of washes.

348
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:03,480
So, guys.

349
00:40:03,639 --> 00:40:07,120
It is time we
to shepherd a lesson.

350
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,440
Come here. Come on.

351
00:40:15,559 --> 00:40:18,200
Not in the face,
Never in the face.

352
00:40:19,079 --> 00:40:21,960
The baron wants
that we're friends.

353
00:40:26,239 --> 00:40:28,080
Come on.

354
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,120
You're still here.

355
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,960
Yes, so to see.

356
00:40:59,239 --> 00:41:00,960
This is voorjou.

357
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:08,240
Now you're here, you can use the dovecote
Please clean?

358
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:11,080
I want to love birds again.

359
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:14,120
No.

360
00:41:15,559 --> 00:41:17,240
Oh, I get it.

361
00:41:18,159 --> 00:41:19,640
Of course.

362
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:22,480
My father has
just lifted his heels

363
00:41:22,639 --> 00:41:26,240
and now a woman in control
has done nothing.

364
00:41:26,559 --> 00:41:29,320
But I will
the estate keep it going,

365
00:41:29,519 --> 00:41:32,360
even if I do everything
to sacrifice for.

366
00:41:32,679 --> 00:41:35,320
I said "No, no beer."
But now you say:

367
00:41:35,639 --> 00:41:38,560
over the bird droppings on yourself,
I'm leaving.

368
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:42,600
What's going on?

369
00:41:44,719 --> 00:41:47,600
Your father
my father had made a promise.

370
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:51,040
He would teach me,
so that I could make something of my life.

371
00:41:51,199 --> 00:41:53,400
But I am nothing
manure larger than one.

372
00:41:53,559 --> 00:41:58,040
And the only thing I've learned is
that your promises are worth nothing.

373
00:42:02,159 --> 00:42:03,880
Come on.

374
00:42:26,039 --> 00:42:29,520
This sword is more than
400 years in my family.

375
00:42:30,159 --> 00:42:32,520
We have blocked
for looters.

376
00:42:32,679 --> 00:42:37,520
One night was one of
our employees and wanted to steal it.

377
00:42:37,679 --> 00:42:41,520
Father hit him so hard,
I thought it would break his skull.

378
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:46,240
I never
allowed to touch.

379
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,520
Great.

380
00:42:54,679 --> 00:42:57,840
Father would take us both
murder when he saw us.

381
00:43:06,239 --> 00:43:09,240
Actually, I wanted to show you this.

382
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:14,680
I have often secretly
In watching.

383
00:43:16,519 --> 00:43:20,160
Pictures of brave men
and beautiful women.

384
00:43:21,239 --> 00:43:24,000
And the words in this book tell

385
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:26,280
how to become a knight.

386
00:43:28,159 --> 00:43:30,000
Begrijpje?

387
00:43:30,159 --> 00:43:33,000
We can study
while my father is gone.

388
00:43:33,159 --> 00:43:37,760
If you behave like a knight,
vaderje will respect.

389
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:41,880
He will fulfill his duty
and you dub.

390
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:44,600
We?

391
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:49,160
- Can you read and understand this language?
- No.

392
00:43:49,719 --> 00:43:52,480
I have.
So I say "we".

393
00:45:46,679 --> 00:45:48,960
Come tonight
to the clearing in the woods.

394
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:51,280
I want to show you something.

395
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:43,400
I wanted to show you this.

396
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:50,080
Only in this place, they wounded costs.
Only thus can they kill.

397
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,920
A sword through the flames
In the mouth of the dragon punches.

398
00:46:55,079 --> 00:46:56,240
Simple.

399
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:58,480
Listen.

400
00:46:59,239 --> 00:47:03,000
In the monastery exchanged a traveler
this at a meal.

401
00:47:03,159 --> 00:47:06,760
Nobody wanted it,
why I got it.

402
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:09,560
- What is it?
- Words.

403
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:13,600
About the power within us and
the things around us.

404
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:15,680
You mean magic.

405
00:47:16,199 --> 00:47:19,160
Gifts, Will.
As the gifts of the paladins.

406
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:21,720
Paladins.
That do not exist.

407
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:25,400
See that?
They are symbols.

408
00:47:25,559 --> 00:47:29,360
Such symbols
Also in the pages of this book.

409
00:47:30,159 --> 00:47:32,120
The knights were real.

410
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:35,280
They were mystic knights
who worshiped their gods.

411
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:39,960
If their hearts pure, they were
blessed with incredible strength.

412
00:47:40,119 --> 00:47:42,440
I thought you were not a witch.

413
00:47:42,599 --> 00:47:44,440
You're not listening, Will.

414
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:48,520
Each of us must find his gift.

415
00:47:48,679 --> 00:47:51,000
Some may see the future.

416
00:47:51,719 --> 00:47:55,000
Understand others
people in their hearts.

417
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:57,720
Others may tame animals.

418
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:02,960
Almost no one has all the gifts.
But everyone has one.

419
00:48:04,719 --> 00:48:07,640
Paladins were Knights
with the gift to believe

420
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:11,040
them unharmed
could go through the fire.

421
00:48:11,199 --> 00:48:13,960
Why should you look for
for something that is not there?

422
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:15,920
Wait.

423
00:48:22,039 --> 00:48:23,920
Loosen up.

424
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:26,680
Now put your hand out.

425
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:32,160
In the beginning it
a dot in the dark.

426
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:35,280
It grows in your heart and knocks.

427
00:48:36,159 --> 00:48:37,960
I feel it.

428
00:48:38,639 --> 00:48:40,400
Let yourself be swept away by it.

429
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:44,520
Until you find your heart
jump out of your chest.

430
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:50,120
Now you can slowly let go,
as a breath

431
00:48:50,639 --> 00:48:53,720
or ... like an explosion.

432
00:48:58,119 --> 00:49:00,800
And that was just a little magic trick.

433
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:03,760
Good night.

434
00:50:04,119 --> 00:50:06,520
- Will? What is it?
- Stay inside!

435
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:10,880
What's that sound?
Will, what's going on?

436
00:50:11,039 --> 00:50:12,560
Will!

437
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:15,000
What are you doing, Will?

438
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:17,520
What was that?

439
00:50:18,039 --> 00:50:21,080
Will ... No. Do not go!

440
00:50:24,519 --> 00:50:27,000
Will, please! Listen to me.

441
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:50,280
Come on!

442
00:51:18,679 --> 00:51:20,800
I'm here! Come on!

443
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:08,800
What happened?

444
00:52:09,559 --> 00:52:11,200
Kate, what happened?

445
00:52:12,719 --> 00:52:15,720
You were almost roasted
chip as a pig.

446
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:19,280
- Blockhead.
- The dragon has slain my father.

447
00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:21,960
You will still want
that he had slain you too.

448
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:35,920
Boy, you have a brave heart.

449
00:52:36,719 --> 00:52:41,320
I hope you're wise enough
You protect against.

450
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:43,360
What has she? Is she hurt?

451
00:52:43,519 --> 00:52:46,320
They ran burns
when she saved your life.

452
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:49,480
My cousin
appears to be a sorceress.

453
00:52:49,639 --> 00:52:52,160
She led the strongest flames
away from you,

454
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:55,280
but they themselves could
do not swerve.

455
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:00,520
- It's a special girl.
- Say nothing against Sterling please.

456
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,040
Will, what is my cattle there?

457
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:38,960
In full bloom, I hope.

458
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:41,400
- You're back.
- Indeed.

459
00:53:41,719 --> 00:53:44,000
Politics is a waste of time.

460
00:53:44,159 --> 00:53:47,000
Nothing but meaningless chatter and fuss.

461
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:52,240
But I do have the dice
a beautiful stallion won.

462
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:56,760
He is five miles to the south.
Do me a favor and get him.

463
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:57,920
Yes, sir.

464
00:54:12,039 --> 00:54:14,120
Kate! Kate!

465
00:54:14,599 --> 00:54:17,240
Shelton
they open a market.

466
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:20,440
It is time to put the family
to reinstate. Come.

467
00:54:33,239 --> 00:54:35,520
Father, I must tell you something.

468
00:54:41,719 --> 00:54:43,800
Father, I wish ...

469
00:54:46,039 --> 00:54:47,560
I taught him.

470
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:50,760
Father, I'm sorry.

471
00:54:51,079 --> 00:54:54,560
- He had no choice ...
- How did he know this?

472
00:54:55,239 --> 00:54:59,000
- The dragon was here and Will ...
You have told him.

473
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:01,160
Yes.

474
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:04,960
He is very brave father.

475
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:08,640
Half of your sword
is still in the body of the beast.

476
00:55:09,239 --> 00:55:10,800
You're a slut.

477
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:14,120
Just like your mother.

478
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:25,040
Eight generations of my ancestors
have this sword honored.

479
00:55:27,719 --> 00:55:29,920
That boy must go.

480
00:55:31,639 --> 00:55:33,520
And as for you ...

481
00:55:34,639 --> 00:55:38,160
I'm tired of you cheating
and your disobedience.

482
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:40,840
You are now
the problem of another.

483
00:55:41,119 --> 00:55:44,760
- What?
- Rogan wants your wife.

484
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:49,080
He wants to tame.
Let him try it.

485
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:57,480
No.

486
00:56:01,719 --> 00:56:03,200
Robert!

487
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:14,520
All these years I thought

488
00:56:15,199 --> 00:56:18,320
that the plague was
Maurelle who had slain.

489
00:56:24,599 --> 00:56:26,920
Maarjij have slain her.

490
00:56:27,079 --> 00:56:31,080
Opje own way.
By jealousy and rage.

491
00:59:15,119 --> 00:59:16,600
Wake up, son.

492
00:59:17,679 --> 00:59:21,400
- Crow What are you doing here?
- I've seen something in the fire.

493
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,480
Sterling's daughter has run away.

494
00:59:24,639 --> 00:59:26,560
- Where is she?
- I do not know.

495
00:59:26,719 --> 00:59:28,640
I head towards Corange.

496
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:31,440
We meet
at sunset in Mealdon.

497
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:41,280
Wake up. Wake up.
Kate is gone.

498
01:00:06,239 --> 01:00:07,720
Kate!

499
01:00:10,239 --> 01:00:11,240
Kate!

500
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:27,920
Kate!

501
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:31,960
Kate!

502
01:00:38,079 --> 01:00:39,560
Kate!

503
01:00:41,159 --> 01:00:42,640
Kate!

504
01:00:52,519 --> 01:00:56,320
Will! Will, I'm here!

505
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:22,160
He'll find anywhere.

506
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:24,240
He will not find me.

507
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:28,200
- Then I have to find him.
- What?

508
01:01:28,840 --> 01:01:30,720
He will be sick with worry.

509
01:01:31,559 --> 01:01:34,360
He's your father. And my master.

510
01:01:34,519 --> 01:01:36,160
That we owe him.

511
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:38,880
Hebje not hear what I said?

512
01:01:39,039 --> 01:01:41,680
Father hates you.
He gives me in marriage to Rogan

513
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:45,160
after you have pierced
with the rest of his sword.

514
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:49,120
- The pigs will miss me.
- Forget the pork!

515
01:01:57,400 --> 01:01:59,800
He will surely find.

516
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:02,120
And one day he will find you.

517
01:02:04,119 --> 01:02:06,800
And what do you think will happen?

518
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:08,720
That's not important.

519
01:02:09,360 --> 01:02:11,160
As long as we are together.

520
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:14,760
I want voorje worry, Kate.

521
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:17,200
But I would not know how.

522
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:19,520
I have no country, no future.

523
01:02:24,559 --> 01:02:26,520
I love you, Kate.

524
01:02:27,599 --> 01:02:31,160
I desire to thee.
My passion can burn us both.

525
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:37,880
But I do not want this way.
I will not flee.

526
01:03:12,360 --> 01:03:14,680
I need you home.

527
01:05:13,599 --> 01:05:16,200
Oh, baby.
Thank God, you live.

528
01:05:16,360 --> 01:05:19,240
I came immediately.
Come in quickly.

529
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:28,200
Take care of the horse, servant.

530
01:05:28,360 --> 01:05:30,200
Two people carry is heavy.

531
01:05:55,880 --> 01:05:59,360
You have brought my daughter home.
I'm in your duty.

532
01:05:59,519 --> 01:06:01,920
I'm gonna wash
Kate and greet.

533
01:06:02,079 --> 01:06:05,480
Then come to the castle.
We need to talk.

534
01:06:14,079 --> 01:06:17,320
It is time we
training to start your vassal.

535
01:06:18,840 --> 01:06:20,320
High time, sir.

536
01:06:21,519 --> 01:06:25,600
You've proven you are a good boy
like, just as brutal.

537
01:06:26,599 --> 01:06:28,080
This ...

538
01:06:29,800 --> 01:06:32,400
This document
you have given me

539
01:06:32,719 --> 01:06:34,440
is a land donation.

540
01:06:35,880 --> 01:06:39,680
I gave your father,
but he did not use it.

541
01:06:41,559 --> 01:06:43,640
Now this country of yours.

542
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:48,080
Or at the time
waaropjij want to claim it.

543
01:06:50,320 --> 01:06:53,080
So now you knight and landowner.

544
01:06:53,239 --> 01:06:56,480
Your future
looks really bright, boy.

545
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:01,840
I take what I may.

546
01:07:03,519 --> 01:07:07,040
Kate has told you
Rogan that she will marry?

547
01:07:07,199 --> 01:07:11,640
- She does not like him.
You think you know what she feels?

548
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:15,760
Rogan is a powerful man, he can
her a secure future.

549
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:19,520
- Hair and therefore you.
- And do not forget.

550
01:07:20,360 --> 01:07:23,480
She does not like him.
I ask for her hand.

551
01:07:23,639 --> 01:07:26,400
You think you're man enough
for her?

552
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:31,840
How long do you think that your country
can hold without my favor?

553
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:35,560
Every baron in the country
is stingy in my blood.

554
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:39,320
- The wolves surround me al
- I bring her to my house.

555
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:42,760
It is difficult, but
she knows from work and I love her.

556
01:07:42,920 --> 01:07:45,200
Love?
How long will it last love,

557
01:07:45,360 --> 01:07:49,240
if the pig
under her fingernails to scrape away?

558
01:07:49,559 --> 01:07:53,320
Would you like her a privileged life
decrease in wealth?

559
01:07:53,480 --> 01:07:57,120
That is not love.
You are too far below its position.

560
01:07:57,280 --> 01:07:59,640
As mother was under your state.

561
01:08:01,159 --> 01:08:05,000
- Kate, go to thee room.
- You have driven her, right?

562
01:08:05,320 --> 01:08:08,720
Who said that? Spriggs?
Jump to thee room!

563
01:08:09,039 --> 01:08:11,480
You you could
never hold tantrums.

564
01:08:11,639 --> 01:08:13,200
So it all started.

565
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:18,640
Your mother was engaged
Wills with father. Did you know?

566
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:22,200
- Shut up, old witch.
- A special woman.

567
01:08:22,359 --> 01:08:25,880
Not the brightest
Sterling who had ever seen,

568
01:08:26,039 --> 01:08:29,120
but she had a spell
that went deeper than beauty.

569
01:08:29,279 --> 01:08:32,880
Sterling was overwhelmed.
He ignored her engagement.

570
01:08:33,039 --> 01:08:35,320
He dazzled her by his wealth.

571
01:08:35,479 --> 01:08:37,600
Finally she agreed.

572
01:08:37,760 --> 01:08:41,240
- Tom's heart was broken.
- Stop it.

573
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:46,760
As a wedding gift bestowed
Sterling your mother a piece of land.

574
01:08:46,920 --> 01:08:50,720
Plagued by guilt
she put the country on Tom's name.

575
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:53,680
Sterling was suspicious.

576
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:57,560
His jealousy and anger
drove him to madness.

577
01:08:57,720 --> 01:09:00,680
The more he checked her,
the more they withdrew.

578
01:09:00,840 --> 01:09:02,840
Maurelle finally fled.

579
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:06,520
She found Tom
and begged him for forgiveness.

580
01:09:07,399 --> 01:09:10,400
But in the meantime had
Tom a wife.

581
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:13,760
There was a baby on the way: Will.

582
01:09:15,199 --> 01:09:18,160
With a broken heart
she returned to her parents.

583
01:09:18,319 --> 01:09:21,040
There she found
she was pregnant.

584
01:09:21,199 --> 01:09:24,320
The man
for whom she had fled.

585
01:09:25,439 --> 01:09:29,960
One day he found her ...
but it was too late.

586
01:09:31,039 --> 01:09:32,800
The plague had got it.

587
01:09:34,119 --> 01:09:36,480
Sterling was mad with grief.

588
01:09:37,199 --> 01:09:42,000
But a magician from the mountains
brought you to him.

589
01:09:43,439 --> 01:09:45,440
His newborn daughter.

590
01:09:47,279 --> 01:09:50,920
Sterling cured of his madness
and brought you home.

591
01:09:55,680 --> 01:09:57,440
I do not want.

592
01:10:00,079 --> 01:10:03,520
You're just a simple soul
as your father.

593
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:08,200
But, Will, I thought ... Will!

594
01:10:08,359 --> 01:10:10,680
It was time for the truth, Robert.

595
01:10:22,520 --> 01:10:24,000
Will!

596
01:10:26,199 --> 01:10:28,640
Listen to me, please.

597
01:10:31,079 --> 01:10:32,880
Let us go away from here.

598
01:10:33,039 --> 01:10:36,160
We begin a new life
in the mountains.

599
01:10:36,319 --> 01:10:39,320
I know
where it will run out, Kate.

600
01:10:40,840 --> 01:10:43,600
- What do you mean?
Your father is right.

601
01:10:45,239 --> 01:10:46,760
No.

602
01:10:47,319 --> 01:10:51,800
It's a hard life.
I would rob you of a better life.

603
01:10:51,960 --> 01:10:55,280
No, no, no.
I do not want to hear.

604
01:11:03,279 --> 01:11:05,240
I'm zonderje away, Kate.

605
01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:10,320
Let me go.

606
01:11:12,760 --> 01:11:14,720
Let go!

607
01:11:28,119 --> 01:11:29,800
Coward!

608
01:11:48,359 --> 01:11:51,480
This land is refused by Will
and now Kate,

609
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:53,880
because the purpose of her mother.

610
01:11:54,359 --> 01:11:56,720
Wedding Kate, it's yours

611
01:11:57,720 --> 01:12:01,120
Her country, my country. Everything.

612
01:12:02,479 --> 01:12:04,840
In return, I
an invitation to the court.

613
01:12:05,479 --> 01:12:09,760
- For this you need a present.
- We spend a fun of it.

614
01:12:45,640 --> 01:12:49,040
Makes it look
if that kid did it.

615
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:08,440
It's good.

616
01:13:29,359 --> 01:13:32,520
Take too long tail to the fire,
Gaje things.

617
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:34,680
Will you always aansluipen?

618
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:38,320
- How hebje me?
- I've stared into the fire.

619
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:40,840
I knew
I'd find you here.

620
01:13:41,159 --> 01:13:43,680
A wounded animal
always goes back home.

621
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,600
I can not go home,
I know.

622
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:49,720
I certainly do not ask
what happened?

623
01:13:51,640 --> 01:13:53,360
The dragon is back.

624
01:13:54,239 --> 01:13:56,360
He has a nest
somewhere on the coast.

625
01:13:57,800 --> 01:14:00,600
I hebje remaining sheep care.

626
01:14:01,439 --> 01:14:04,360
The dragon eats them with relish,
Despite soapwort.

627
01:14:04,680 --> 01:14:07,720
They are your sheep.
I gave them to you.

628
01:14:09,800 --> 01:14:11,800
Why hebje said nothing?

629
01:14:12,439 --> 01:14:15,720
That was one thing
between your father and Sterling.

630
01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:18,880
Not your business
and certainly not mine.

631
01:14:21,039 --> 01:14:25,280
There are new rumors.
Sterling stallion has disappeared.

632
01:14:26,199 --> 01:14:28,640
They say that you've stolen it.

633
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:31,320
I do not know
where that damn horse.

634
01:14:31,479 --> 01:14:34,080
They look for a reason
to kill me.

635
01:14:34,239 --> 01:14:37,360
I know Sterling.
He would kill you for no reason.

636
01:14:37,680 --> 01:14:39,680
Tell me what to say.

637
01:14:41,359 --> 01:14:44,000
Go to him
go and confront.

638
01:14:44,159 --> 01:14:47,360
I see no reason.
Every person has his limits.

639
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:51,560
I thought the reason had green eyes
and no wall was built.

640
01:14:51,720 --> 01:14:54,040
At least not without help.

641
01:15:02,720 --> 01:15:07,040
You're a smart girl. With time
you will understand my decision.

642
01:15:07,199 --> 01:15:10,120
Say goodbye to your father,
as it should.

643
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:16,440
The men are restless.

644
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:19,800
- And I hate waiting.
- Customize opje words, Rogan.

645
01:15:19,960 --> 01:15:22,400
- Yet she is not yours
- Oh no?

646
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:24,720
I doubt that we have a chance.

647
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:28,840
Those stories of sorcery
and witch art nonsense.

648
01:15:29,159 --> 01:15:31,720
Dragons are not magical creatures.

649
01:15:32,039 --> 01:15:34,720
You can kill them
like any other animal.

650
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:37,040
We do it
like others before us.

651
01:15:37,359 --> 01:15:40,960
We catch him, tie him up
and pull his tongue out.

652
01:15:41,279 --> 01:15:44,040
- Are the horses ready?
Yes, my lord.

653
01:15:44,199 --> 01:15:45,760
The hunt is open.

654
01:15:57,680 --> 01:16:01,680
Good luck and
foretaste of future joys.

655
01:16:04,359 --> 01:16:06,040
You go too far, sir.

656
01:16:06,920 --> 01:16:08,720
Still not far enough.

657
01:16:37,159 --> 01:16:38,960
I want to speak Sterling.

658
01:16:39,119 --> 01:16:41,400
He will not come back soon.

659
01:16:41,720 --> 01:16:44,000
Kate walked towards forest.

660
01:16:44,520 --> 01:16:46,920
- I want to Sterling.
Too bad.

661
01:16:47,239 --> 01:16:49,760
You come because of this stallion?

662
01:16:50,680 --> 01:16:54,880
They found him next to the servant Sam.
Or what was left of him.

663
01:16:56,199 --> 01:16:58,640
So you can feel free to go.

664
01:16:59,880 --> 01:17:02,760
- What happened to him?
- It was the dragon.

665
01:17:03,880 --> 01:17:06,400
Sterling opjacht gone.

666
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:09,120
He plans
to kill the beast

667
01:17:09,439 --> 01:17:12,040
and wealth and honor to achieve.

668
01:17:13,359 --> 01:17:15,680
A risky enterprise,

669
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:19,120
but I
that the price is worth the risk.

670
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:22,600
I have a sword.

671
01:17:23,680 --> 01:17:25,720
And a horse, I think.

672
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:32,440
It was my grandfather,
maarjij have the same build.

673
01:17:34,039 --> 01:17:36,960
- Kneel before me, boy.
- What?

674
01:17:37,119 --> 01:17:39,000
The privilege of my title.

675
01:17:39,159 --> 01:17:42,960
I'm entitled to my own knights
to choose. Kneel down.

676
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:55,800
Strive courageously for justice.

677
01:17:57,199 --> 01:18:00,440
May God
give you wisdom and faith.

678
01:18:02,199 --> 01:18:05,080
Verhefje as a knight.

679
01:18:10,840 --> 01:18:12,680
I am very attached to this sword.

680
01:18:14,079 --> 01:18:17,520
Be a good boy
and get the missing piece.

681
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:42,280
The rah!

682
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:44,840
Kate!

683
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:12,840
It smells like he's around.

684
01:19:25,279 --> 01:19:27,120
- Kate, you're finally there.
- Will Is Here?

685
01:19:27,880 --> 01:19:31,400
He was here.
But he's gone opjacht.

686
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:35,200
- Where Gaje go?
- A horse saddle.

687
01:19:35,359 --> 01:19:39,160
Be wise, Kate. Death
meet is not a solution.

688
01:19:40,439 --> 01:19:44,440
Although Rogan probably also
a body to wife.

689
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:04,720
Crow! Crow!

690
01:20:04,880 --> 01:20:08,320
- What is it, boy?
- I sheep who need it.

691
01:20:08,479 --> 01:20:11,440
- If you pay for them.
- And that jar too.

692
01:20:17,239 --> 01:20:19,160
Wait, pour it somewhere else.

693
01:20:19,479 --> 01:20:20,960
No time.

694
01:20:22,039 --> 01:20:24,880
- I hope for a good cause.
- That's it.

695
01:21:06,279 --> 01:21:09,320
Tie the horses.
We continue on foot.

696
01:21:24,840 --> 01:21:28,040
This is a good place.
Prepare for the bait.

697
01:21:44,600 --> 01:21:46,080
What does he want here?

698
01:21:51,319 --> 01:21:54,240
This is a bad place.
No cover.

699
01:21:54,399 --> 01:21:57,200
He'll need to narrow down,
otherwise you will be roasted.

700
01:21:57,520 --> 01:22:01,400
- Do not tell me what to do.
- We have a clear view.

701
01:22:01,560 --> 01:22:03,360
This place is perfect.

702
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:05,640
You make a mistake.
I've seen the beast.

703
01:22:05,800 --> 01:22:08,760
It hebje
lost a precious sword.

704
01:22:08,920 --> 01:22:11,560
And you had your
be rescued by a woman.

705
01:22:11,720 --> 01:22:14,080
Go back to the stable
if you are scared.

706
01:22:15,880 --> 01:22:17,680
You'll die meaningless.

707
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:24,120
Wait.

708
01:22:26,520 --> 01:22:28,680
This I found in a pile of ashes.

709
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:31,320
It's yours.

710
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:37,520
- Success.
You, too.

711
01:24:20,279 --> 01:24:23,080
Kate! Kate, go back!

712
01:24:25,319 --> 01:24:27,200
Go back!

713
01:25:17,479 --> 01:25:20,200
- Father.
- It's okay.

714
01:25:20,520 --> 01:25:22,480
Let me get out of here.

715
01:25:22,640 --> 01:25:25,600
- Where's Will?
- The coward fled.

716
01:25:25,920 --> 01:25:27,120
Here he comes.

717
01:26:05,319 --> 01:26:07,440
Father ... Father.

718
01:26:11,880 --> 01:26:13,560
Witchcraft.

719
01:26:13,720 --> 01:26:15,640
You did this cause.

720
01:26:15,800 --> 01:26:17,280
What?

721
01:26:18,279 --> 01:26:20,360
Your father said
that I had to tame.

722
01:26:20,520 --> 01:26:23,840
I will not tame.
No one!

723
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:27,480
You spurn me
and choose a country boy?

724
01:26:30,159 --> 01:26:31,840
That we will see.

725
01:27:13,359 --> 01:27:15,080
Bring it on!

726
01:27:16,760 --> 01:27:17,840
Come on!

727
01:27:55,039 --> 01:27:57,400
- What are you doing?
- You'll see.

728
01:27:59,319 --> 01:28:01,440
We can
kill the dragon together.

729
01:28:01,600 --> 01:28:05,480
I'm not on that dragon.
I actually have more problems with you.

730
01:28:05,640 --> 01:28:09,800
I thought it was adoration.
But she wants to go your way.

731
01:28:09,960 --> 01:28:12,400
I can not allow.

732
01:28:16,840 --> 01:28:20,040
It would mean much
that they are above farmer you prefer.

733
01:28:21,199 --> 01:28:24,280
I admit,
You have a lot of guts.

734
01:28:24,439 --> 01:28:26,960
My dogs
will feast tonight.

735
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:11,960
This is much more personal
than with a sword.

736
01:32:36,880 --> 01:32:39,120
Careful, man.

737
01:32:41,920 --> 01:32:44,760
My god, that stuff stinks.

738
01:32:53,039 --> 01:32:55,120
Lubrication is not even more.

739
01:32:55,439 --> 01:32:57,640
Geefje me some respect?

740
01:33:07,279 --> 01:33:08,960
Will.

741
01:33:14,520 --> 01:33:16,000
It's Will.

742
01:33:16,760 --> 01:33:19,840
You're lucky
that Crow has brought the ointment.

743
01:34:08,399 --> 01:34:11,360
- I Gaje home.
- Going home?

744
01:34:20,800 --> 01:34:22,440
It's worth 1000 gold pieces.

745
01:34:38,199 --> 01:34:40,520
What happens out there?

746
01:34:41,079 --> 01:34:44,440
Nothing that you can do something,
Robert.

747
01:34:48,359 --> 01:34:50,160
Where is Lady Spriggs?

748
01:34:50,319 --> 01:34:52,440
Inside, I think. Why?

749
01:34:52,600 --> 01:34:55,320
I have a piece of a sword for her.

750
01:34:56,020 --> 01:34:59,755
