00:02:15,163 --> 00:02:20,156
67, 68, 69.

5
00:02:23,307 --> 00:02:25,333
My favorite fucking number.

6
00:02:25,375 --> 00:02:28,605
You guys got a front row
seat to the gun show.

7
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:32,636
Guys, you know, this place

8
00:02:32,678 --> 00:02:34,639
is a historical landmark, right?

9
00:02:34,681 --> 00:02:35,983
Why don't you go explore it?

10
00:02:36,025 --> 00:02:39,020
Maybe take a hike just
a little fucking bit.

11
00:02:39,062 --> 00:02:41,742
Yeah, Zack, don't you
need history to graduate?

12
00:02:42,708 --> 00:02:44,294
I got your historical
landmark right here

13
00:02:44,336 --> 00:02:46,592
in my fucking pants, all right.

14
00:02:46,634 --> 00:02:50,038
This here cock and balls is
a national fucking treasure.

15
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:50,912
Got that.

16
00:02:53,137 --> 00:02:53,927
Let's go.

17
00:02:53,969 --> 00:02:55,932
All right, we'll let
you guys play boyfriend

18
00:02:55,974 --> 00:02:56,816
and girlfriend.

19
00:03:01,859 --> 00:03:03,727
Historical landmark?

20
00:03:03,769 --> 00:03:06,183
It got us alone, didn't it?

21
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,359
- Hey Brad?
- What's up?

22
00:03:09,401 --> 00:03:11,372
Why is this place called Legacy Park?

23
00:03:12,437 --> 00:03:13,474
Shit, who cares?

24
00:03:13,516 --> 00:03:15,742
Nothing happens in Donville anyway.

25
00:03:15,784 --> 00:03:18,679
- It's fucking dead end.
- I know.

26
00:03:18,721 --> 00:03:19,920
That's why I was asking.

27
00:03:22,923 --> 00:03:24,758
Honestly, who cares
about the fucking past?

28
00:03:28,951 --> 00:03:30,939
- What's up?
- I gotta pee.

29
00:03:32,225 --> 00:03:33,716
Don't worry, I won't fall in.

30
00:03:33,758 --> 00:03:34,590
Whatever.

31
00:03:42,142 --> 00:03:42,974
Fuck.

32
00:03:46,571 --> 00:03:49,237
[water running]

33
00:03:52,742 --> 00:03:55,572
[spooky laughing]

34
00:04:05,054 --> 00:04:06,101
What's up, Brad?

35
00:04:06,143 --> 00:04:07,765
Where'd she go? Did you
gross her out or something?

36
00:04:07,807 --> 00:04:09,514
Small dick? What's the problem?

37
00:04:09,556 --> 00:04:10,935
I thought I told you
to fucking take a hike.

38
00:04:10,977 --> 00:04:13,394
Dude, there's nothing to
fucking do here, all right.

39
00:04:13,436 --> 00:04:16,171
We've been playing faggot
Frisbee for a half an hour.

40
00:04:16,213 --> 00:04:17,729
Yeah, this place sucks, bro.

41
00:04:17,771 --> 00:04:19,577
- Like your mom.
- Like your mom.

42
00:04:19,619 --> 00:04:20,976
There's nowhere else to go.

43
00:04:21,018 --> 00:04:22,274
Even when we get our degrees,

44
00:04:22,316 --> 00:04:24,862
we're still gonna be in
the same spot, stuck here.

45
00:04:24,904 --> 00:04:26,190
No shit.

46
00:04:26,232 --> 00:04:29,179
Hey, Zack are you even
graduating this year?

47
00:04:30,331 --> 00:04:32,124
Yeah, I'm fucking graduating.

48
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:34,342
Why don't you mind your own
fucking business, Jerry?

49
00:04:34,384 --> 00:04:35,451
Jesus Christ.

50
00:04:35,493 --> 00:04:37,030
What is this, your fucking 10th year?

51
00:04:37,072 --> 00:04:38,428
Yeah, I know.

52
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:40,077
What are you like 30 now?

53
00:04:40,119 --> 00:04:42,194
Do you wanna know how old I am?

54
00:04:42,236 --> 00:04:45,041
I'm old enough for your mom
to call me fucking daddy.

55
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:46,070
How about that?

56
00:04:46,112 --> 00:04:47,479
Oh!

57
00:04:47,521 --> 00:04:49,187
I don't know what you're
laughing about, Jerry.

58
00:04:49,229 --> 00:04:51,776
Your mom takes it up the
tailpipe like a champ too.

59
00:04:52,704 --> 00:04:55,001
This dude never has a serious answer.

60
00:04:55,043 --> 00:04:56,429
I speak the truth, all right.

61
00:04:56,471 --> 00:04:57,785
He always talks about his dick.

62
00:04:57,827 --> 00:04:59,311
Can I get a witness?

63
00:05:07,091 --> 00:05:08,930
- Hey Liz.
- Marcus.

64
00:05:08,972 --> 00:05:10,705
What are you doing here?

65
00:05:10,747 --> 00:05:12,323
I always come here.

66
00:05:12,365 --> 00:05:15,220
Okay and what do you want?

67
00:05:15,262 --> 00:05:17,738
Well, my birthday is coming up tomorrow

68
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:19,486
and I was wondering if you wanted to come.

69
00:05:19,528 --> 00:05:20,595
What's this?

70
00:05:20,637 --> 00:05:22,218
It's my birthday invitation.

71
00:05:23,924 --> 00:05:25,281
It has clowns on it.

72
00:05:25,323 --> 00:05:26,340
Why clowns?

73
00:05:26,382 --> 00:05:28,168
Clowns are my favorite.

74
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:29,227
What the fuck do you think you're doing

75
00:05:29,269 --> 00:05:30,315
around my girl, retard?

76
00:05:30,357 --> 00:05:31,354
Look at you, Marcus.

77
00:05:31,396 --> 00:05:33,632
Looking like the
motherfucking Kool-Aid man.

78
00:05:33,674 --> 00:05:35,240
Yeah, big man, huh?

79
00:05:35,282 --> 00:05:36,669
Unlock me some Kool-Aid.

80
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:38,577
Don't you like Kool-Aid?

81
00:05:38,619 --> 00:05:39,894
Atomic nuggie.

82
00:05:41,586 --> 00:05:43,202
I asked you a question, Tubby.

83
00:05:43,244 --> 00:05:44,740
I was only asking Liz if she wanted

84
00:05:44,782 --> 00:05:46,708
to celebrate my birthday tomorrow.

85
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:47,540
Yeah, bullshit.

86
00:05:47,582 --> 00:05:48,857
You were probably peeping
on her taking a piss,

87
00:05:48,899 --> 00:05:50,365
- weren't you, you fat retard?
- Right.

88
00:05:50,407 --> 00:05:51,554
[Marcus yelping]

89
00:05:51,596 --> 00:05:52,844
[Liz] Leave him alone, Brad.

90
00:05:52,886 --> 00:05:54,253
[Brad] Stay out of this, Liz.

91
00:05:55,429 --> 00:05:59,258
[Marcus yelping and coughing]

92
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:02,706
This is only a taste, you
keep on fucking with my girl.

93
00:06:02,748 --> 00:06:04,573
You got it?

94
00:06:04,615 --> 00:06:05,759
This is your last warning.

95
00:06:05,801 --> 00:06:08,350
That's right, choke on
the motherfucking ground.

96
00:06:08,392 --> 00:06:10,844
[Marcus coughing]

97
00:06:10,886 --> 00:06:12,613
Keep your face in the
fucking dirt, retard.

98
00:06:12,655 --> 00:06:13,853
That's where it belongs.

99
00:06:15,586 --> 00:06:17,577
[Brad] Are you shitting me?

100
00:06:17,619 --> 00:06:19,500
[paper ripping]
Get the fuck outta here.

101
00:06:20,836 --> 00:06:23,441
Are you jealous, Brad?

102
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:25,559
Yeah, there's all kinds of
fucking freaks around here.

103
00:06:25,601 --> 00:06:28,204
- I have to protect you.
- My hero.

104
00:07:09,314 --> 00:07:12,061
[stick breaking]

105
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:16,927
[spooky laughing]

106
00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:19,414
Who's there?
[spooky laughing]

107
00:07:19,456 --> 00:07:20,298
Show yourself.

108
00:07:21,769 --> 00:07:22,776
[book dropping]

109
00:07:22,818 --> 00:07:24,791
[spooky circus music]

110
00:07:42,445 --> 00:07:43,529
[Amy] How could you treat me like this?

111
00:07:43,571 --> 00:07:45,787
[Kelly] Treating you,
how is this my fault?

112
00:07:45,829 --> 00:07:47,282
I'm the one being stood up all the time

113
00:07:47,324 --> 00:07:48,975
while you drive out to God knows where.

114
00:07:49,017 --> 00:07:50,553
This is my final year of grad school.

115
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:51,888
I got research to do.

116
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:53,427
You knew this when we started dating.

117
00:07:53,469 --> 00:07:54,618
Where are you going?

118
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,187
I can't take it anymore.

119
00:07:56,229 --> 00:07:57,436
You don't wanna be seen with me.

120
00:07:57,478 --> 00:07:59,136
You don't even want your
own mother to know about us.

121
00:07:59,178 --> 00:08:00,402
My mother isn't even,

122
00:08:00,444 --> 00:08:01,781
I don't even talk to my mother anymore.

123
00:08:01,823 --> 00:08:02,849
Why do you think that is?

124
00:08:02,891 --> 00:08:04,704
- She doesn't approve.
- Oh, so that's my fault too.

125
00:08:04,746 --> 00:08:06,037
No, it's just...

126
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:08,094
Not now, Marcus, okay?

127
00:08:08,136 --> 00:08:10,832
Jesus, Amy, you can't even
focus on me for two seconds.

128
00:08:10,874 --> 00:08:11,861
Honey, Marcus is okay,

129
00:08:11,903 --> 00:08:13,410
- he's just-
- I don't care.

130
00:08:13,452 --> 00:08:14,416
I don't care.

131
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:17,366
You're no better than those
kids who go to local college.

132
00:08:17,408 --> 00:08:19,086
Kelly, what are you talking about?

133
00:08:19,128 --> 00:08:20,319
Go back to your research, Amy,

134
00:08:20,361 --> 00:08:22,290
and get your graduate degree.

135
00:08:22,332 --> 00:08:23,719
Until then, it's over.

136
00:08:23,761 --> 00:08:24,551
- I love you.
- It's over.

137
00:08:24,593 --> 00:08:25,996
- No, I love-
- Get off me, Amy.

138
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:27,410
Come back here.

139
00:08:28,268 --> 00:08:29,902
Is there some kind of problem here?

140
00:08:29,944 --> 00:08:31,431
No, Mr. Belson.

141
00:08:31,473 --> 00:08:35,547
You know, I can't evict
you for being deviants,

142
00:08:35,589 --> 00:08:38,494
and I wish I could, but I can evict you

143
00:08:38,536 --> 00:08:40,192
for causing a disturbance.

144
00:08:40,234 --> 00:08:41,916
Leave her alone.

145
00:08:43,031 --> 00:08:44,323
Or else what?

146
00:08:45,439 --> 00:08:47,325
Gonna have my rent next month, boy?

147
00:08:47,367 --> 00:08:50,032
I always pay on time, Mr. Belson.

148
00:08:50,074 --> 00:08:51,252
My brother gives me some money-

149
00:08:51,294 --> 00:08:53,398
- And the rest comes from public support.

150
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,627
I've heard it before.

151
00:08:54,669 --> 00:08:57,314
You know, I'm a taxpayer
and I have to sit back

152
00:08:57,356 --> 00:09:01,341
and wait for my own tax
money to come back to me.

153
00:09:01,383 --> 00:09:02,732
Funny, isn't it [laughing]?

154
00:09:04,143 --> 00:09:08,354
As for you, I'm hoping I don't see you

155
00:09:08,396 --> 00:09:11,520
bring her kind around here again,

156
00:09:11,562 --> 00:09:14,110
unless I can watch [laughing].

157
00:09:15,258 --> 00:09:16,255
Have a nice day.

158
00:09:16,297 --> 00:09:17,619
You sick fuck.

159
00:09:19,757 --> 00:09:21,339
[door slamming]

160
00:09:29,558 --> 00:09:32,472
[ringtone chiming]

161
00:09:37,066 --> 00:09:39,432
- Hi Marcus.
- Hi. Dan.

162
00:09:39,474 --> 00:09:40,851
How are you?

163
00:09:40,893 --> 00:09:41,683
I'm good, Marcus.

164
00:09:41,725 --> 00:09:43,228
How are you?

165
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:45,855
Okay, I guess.

166
00:09:45,897 --> 00:09:47,711
How's my sister doing?

167
00:09:48,634 --> 00:09:51,540
I think I saw her break
up with her girlfriend.

168
00:09:51,582 --> 00:09:53,758
Oh no.

169
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:57,014
Well, they've broken up before.

170
00:09:57,056 --> 00:09:58,323
Maybe it'll work out.

171
00:09:58,365 --> 00:10:00,810
Yeah, yeah maybe.

172
00:10:00,852 --> 00:10:03,148
So what else is new?

173
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:05,125
I just wanted to talk, that's all.

174
00:10:05,167 --> 00:10:06,449
Really?

175
00:10:07,355 --> 00:10:08,966
What's wrong, Marcus?

176
00:10:09,892 --> 00:10:11,264
What's the matter?

177
00:10:14,099 --> 00:10:17,513
That guy, Brad, beat me up again.

178
00:10:17,555 --> 00:10:19,818
That guy you told me about?

179
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21,649
Aw, man, I'm sorry.

180
00:10:21,691 --> 00:10:23,717
I asked Liz if she wanted
to celebrate my birthday

181
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:26,983
with me tomorrow and he didn't like that.

182
00:10:27,025 --> 00:10:29,790
Hey man, she's not your friend.

183
00:10:29,832 --> 00:10:31,129
I'm your friend.

184
00:10:31,171 --> 00:10:33,077
You should invite me.

185
00:10:33,119 --> 00:10:35,115
But you live too far away.

186
00:10:35,157 --> 00:10:37,069
I'm gonna be in town for a week.

187
00:10:38,373 --> 00:10:40,370
I'll be staying with my sister.

188
00:10:40,412 --> 00:10:42,588
Maybe we can have your birthday then.

189
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:44,895
Oh wow, that'd be great.

190
00:10:44,937 --> 00:10:47,488
Things can be tough, Marcus, I know.

191
00:10:48,633 --> 00:10:50,849
I live with my mom and her boyfriend

192
00:10:50,891 --> 00:10:51,863
and it's no fun.

193
00:10:53,129 --> 00:10:58,121
But soon me, you, and my sister,

194
00:10:58,163 --> 00:11:00,086
we can all hang out together.

195
00:11:00,128 --> 00:11:02,208
I'd like that, Dan.

196
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:04,865
Hey, Marcus, I'm watching
wrestling right now.

197
00:11:04,907 --> 00:11:07,492
Can we talk later?

198
00:11:07,534 --> 00:11:09,970
Oh sure, give me a call later.

199
00:11:10,012 --> 00:11:11,398
Will do.

200
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,742
Thanks for calling, buddy.

201
00:11:14,907 --> 00:11:16,318
Say hi to my sister for me.

202
00:11:17,999 --> 00:11:20,898
And don't worry about the bad people.

203
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:22,656
Think about the good people.

204
00:11:22,698 --> 00:11:24,221
Okay, bye Dan.

205
00:11:38,801 --> 00:11:41,587
[spooky music]

206
00:11:41,629 --> 00:11:43,490
Esposito's Circus.

207
00:11:46,095 --> 00:11:47,077
For Marcus.

208
00:11:52,409 --> 00:11:56,662
We see your pain and feel your suffering,

209
00:11:56,704 --> 00:11:59,020
for helping people with
special needs, like you,

210
00:11:59,062 --> 00:12:01,078
is in our nature.

211
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,905
All that needs to be done
now is your sacrifice

212
00:12:03,947 --> 00:12:07,391
that is to come, then your
revenge will be served

213
00:12:07,433 --> 00:12:08,392
upon them.

214
00:12:09,993 --> 00:12:13,274
- [door knocking]
- Marcus, it's me.

215
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:14,422
Can I come in?

216
00:12:14,464 --> 00:12:15,738
Just a second.

217
00:12:21,667 --> 00:12:22,596
Yes, Amy?

218
00:12:22,638 --> 00:12:25,283
Hi, is it okay if we
hang out for a little bit?

219
00:12:25,325 --> 00:12:27,323
Sure, Amy. Come on in.

220
00:12:36,218 --> 00:12:37,406
I need a hug.

221
00:12:39,671 --> 00:12:40,736
You okay, Amy?

222
00:12:41,789 --> 00:12:42,621
Yeah.

223
00:12:45,245 --> 00:12:46,227
Are you okay?

224
00:12:47,423 --> 00:12:49,793
You looked really upset
when I saw you come in.

225
00:12:52,437 --> 00:12:55,432
It was Brian and his shithead
classmates again, wasn't it?

226
00:12:55,474 --> 00:12:57,023
They didn't hurt you, did they?

227
00:12:58,401 --> 00:13:00,748
I swear to God, next time I see them,

228
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:02,666
I'm gonna make sure they
shit their balls out.

229
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:05,523
Amy, please I don't
want anymore trouble.

230
00:13:05,565 --> 00:13:08,939
Hey, come on, this has
been going on long enough.

231
00:13:08,981 --> 00:13:11,077
You just want them to
continue stepping on you?

232
00:13:11,119 --> 00:13:13,344
It wasn't completely their fault.

233
00:13:13,386 --> 00:13:15,362
I asked Liz if she wanted
to celebrate my birthday

234
00:13:15,404 --> 00:13:16,490
with me tomorrow.

235
00:13:16,532 --> 00:13:18,404
And you thought she would agree?

236
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:24,224
Marcus, listen, Liz
doesn't care about you.

237
00:13:24,266 --> 00:13:27,120
Besides, she has that asshole
Brad, as her boyfriend.

238
00:13:27,162 --> 00:13:28,010
I know.

239
00:13:28,052 --> 00:13:30,001
I just wanna have friends
to celebrate my birthday

240
00:13:30,043 --> 00:13:31,956
with me tomorrow.

241
00:13:31,998 --> 00:13:33,354
I'm your friend.

242
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:35,192
That bitch and that
crowd she hangs out with

243
00:13:35,234 --> 00:13:37,884
spits on people with
disabilities like you.

244
00:13:40,269 --> 00:13:41,186
I'll tell you what?

245
00:13:41,228 --> 00:13:43,104
How 'bout tomorrow we go shopping

246
00:13:43,146 --> 00:13:45,401
and I'll buy your favorite cake you like?

247
00:13:45,443 --> 00:13:46,620
How does that sound?

248
00:13:46,662 --> 00:13:48,419
Peanut butter and chocolate?

249
00:13:48,461 --> 00:13:50,876
You got it.
[both laughing]

250
00:13:50,918 --> 00:13:53,054
Hey, do you wanna have dinner with me?

251
00:13:53,096 --> 00:13:54,433
- Tomorrow?
- Tonight?

252
00:13:54,475 --> 00:13:55,751
Oh, I would love that.

253
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:56,880
Let me just go lock the door.

254
00:13:56,922 --> 00:13:57,879
Okay.

255
00:13:57,921 --> 00:13:59,133
Oh, and Dan says hi.

256
00:14:00,491 --> 00:14:01,375
You know what?

257
00:14:01,417 --> 00:14:03,153
Tell him I said hi and we'll see him soon.

258
00:14:03,195 --> 00:14:05,022
- Okay.
- Okay, I'll be right back.

259
00:14:05,064 --> 00:14:05,896
Okay.

260
00:14:13,289 --> 00:14:16,036
[ball swooshing]

261
00:14:18,909 --> 00:14:21,573
[door knocking]

262
00:14:24,726 --> 00:14:25,808
Hi, Marcus.

263
00:14:26,901 --> 00:14:29,077
Wait, Marcus, hold on.

264
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,206
Let me explain.

265
00:14:30,248 --> 00:14:31,447
What do you want, Liz?

266
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:35,901
I'm really sorry about
what Brad put you through.

267
00:14:35,943 --> 00:14:38,858
In fact, I'm no longer his
girlfriend because of it.

268
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:41,215
So, what does that mean between us?

269
00:14:41,257 --> 00:14:44,851
It means I'm willing to
celebrate your birthday tomorrow.

270
00:14:44,893 --> 00:14:48,782
Oh, wow, that's great.

271
00:14:48,824 --> 00:14:50,385
Could it be at my place?

272
00:14:50,427 --> 00:14:52,903
Sure, but I don't know where you live.

273
00:14:52,945 --> 00:14:53,902
Here's the address.

274
00:14:53,944 --> 00:14:56,144
Wow, thank you, Liz.

275
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:59,797
So, my place tomorrow, 8:00.

276
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,275
- Sound good?
- Sounds good.

277
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:02,666
All right, don't be late.

278
00:15:03,754 --> 00:15:04,586
I won't.

279
00:15:12,305 --> 00:15:14,226
Marcus, we need to talk.

280
00:15:15,742 --> 00:15:17,957
Uh, about what?

281
00:15:17,999 --> 00:15:21,444
You still think that Liz
wants to be your friend?

282
00:15:21,486 --> 00:15:24,202
Can't you see she's gonna
manipulate you and hurt you?

283
00:15:24,244 --> 00:15:26,766
Oh, you don't know what
you're talking about.

284
00:15:26,808 --> 00:15:27,598
Yes, I do.

285
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,927
That bitch doesn't care about you.

286
00:15:28,969 --> 00:15:30,255
All she wants to do is hurt you.

287
00:15:30,297 --> 00:15:31,612
Oh, whatever.

288
00:15:31,654 --> 00:15:34,820
No wonder your girlfriend
dumped you [gasping].

289
00:15:34,862 --> 00:15:36,529
You know what, fine.

290
00:15:36,571 --> 00:15:38,102
I can't protect you anymore.

291
00:15:39,088 --> 00:15:40,437
You make your own mistakes.

292
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:47,361
[cymbal music]

293
00:16:12,253 --> 00:16:14,593
[door knocking]

294
00:16:14,635 --> 00:16:15,425
[Liz] Who is it?

295
00:16:15,467 --> 00:16:17,088
It's me, Marcus.

296
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:17,920
[Liz] Come right in.

297
00:16:17,962 --> 00:16:18,794
The door's open.

298
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:23,181
Hi, Liz.

299
00:16:23,223 --> 00:16:25,168
This is a nice place you've got there.

300
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:27,547
Thanks, come sit down.

301
00:16:27,589 --> 00:16:28,975
Okay.

302
00:16:29,017 --> 00:16:30,466
Thanks again for inviting me.

303
00:16:31,454 --> 00:16:33,473
You know why I asked you here?

304
00:16:33,515 --> 00:16:35,859
No, but I would like to know.

305
00:16:35,901 --> 00:16:37,068
Fine, come closer.

306
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:37,942
Okay.

307
00:16:39,917 --> 00:16:41,608
Well, since it's your birthday,

308
00:16:43,183 --> 00:16:46,461
I want you to kiss me.

309
00:16:46,503 --> 00:16:49,784
- Uh, are you sure?
- I'm sure.

310
00:16:49,826 --> 00:16:52,716
- Close your eyes.
- Okay.

311
00:16:55,579 --> 00:16:57,476
[dog lapping]

312
00:16:57,518 --> 00:16:58,575
[Brad] Now.

313
00:16:58,617 --> 00:17:00,197
Happy birthday, retard.

314
00:17:00,239 --> 00:17:02,018
[Zack] I can't believe
you're kissing the dog.

315
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:02,850
Hi, buddy.

316
00:17:02,892 --> 00:17:04,065
I can't believe you kissed a dog.

317
00:17:04,107 --> 00:17:06,453
- What's wrong?
- Happy birthday, Marcus.

318
00:17:06,495 --> 00:17:08,978
[Zack] You don't wanna
lose your virginity to a dog?

319
00:17:10,193 --> 00:17:11,725
Run home to mommy, Maybe she'll

320
00:17:11,767 --> 00:17:13,022
bake you a fucking cake.

321
00:17:13,064 --> 00:17:14,352
[Brad]... run out on her?

322
00:17:14,394 --> 00:17:15,299
[Zack] Fatty.

323
00:17:15,341 --> 00:17:17,921
[horror music]

324
00:17:18,795 --> 00:17:21,209
[dramatic tone]

325
00:17:21,251 --> 00:17:23,832
[spooky music]

326
00:17:41,993 --> 00:17:43,734
Shit, Marcus.

327
00:17:44,671 --> 00:17:46,844
- Is he fucking dead?
- What the fuck, man?

328
00:17:48,243 --> 00:17:49,434
- Marcus.
- Marcus.

329
00:17:49,476 --> 00:17:51,627
- Retard.
- Marcus, wake up.

330
00:17:52,982 --> 00:17:53,909
Dude, he's fucking dead.

331
00:17:53,951 --> 00:17:54,988
He's fucking dead.

332
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:55,820
- This is your fault.
- Hold on, hold on,

333
00:17:55,862 --> 00:17:56,694
hold on, hold on.

334
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:02,210
He's not responding to a nuggie.

335
00:18:02,252 --> 00:18:03,501
He's really fucking dead.

336
00:18:06,111 --> 00:18:08,692
[spooky music]

337
00:18:51,193 --> 00:18:52,179
Welcome.

338
00:18:52,221 --> 00:18:55,056
We've been expecting you.

339
00:18:55,098 --> 00:18:55,936
I told them.

340
00:18:55,978 --> 00:18:59,962
I says, I says, just
you wait, he'll be here.

341
00:19:00,004 --> 00:19:02,859
There's a lot of work to do, Marcus.

342
00:19:02,901 --> 00:19:05,655
And we're here to help.

343
00:19:05,697 --> 00:19:07,740
How do you know my name?

344
00:19:07,782 --> 00:19:10,161
[giggling] We know a lot more

345
00:19:10,203 --> 00:19:11,779
than you'd expect [giggling].

346
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:17,659
But you shouldn't concern
yourself with such things.

347
00:19:18,495 --> 00:19:23,259
Like I said before, we're here to help.

348
00:19:23,301 --> 00:19:24,792
Help, how?

349
00:19:25,808 --> 00:19:30,754
Well, you kind of just left your life

350
00:19:30,796 --> 00:19:32,909
unfinished didn't ya?

351
00:19:34,189 --> 00:19:38,797
Kind of just left because of others.

352
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:44,616
You left and there is
still so much more to do.

353
00:19:44,658 --> 00:19:48,583
You see, we are here to
help you set things right.

354
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:49,971
Right the wrong.

355
00:19:50,013 --> 00:19:53,067
Punish those that caused
you pain [giggling].

356
00:19:54,389 --> 00:19:55,925
How do I do that?

357
00:19:55,967 --> 00:19:58,322
That's where we come
in, bucko [giggling].

358
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:02,397
- But-
- No buts about it [giggling].

359
00:20:04,468 --> 00:20:06,943
But we need the book.

360
00:20:06,985 --> 00:20:08,482
It's part of us.

361
00:20:08,524 --> 00:20:10,240
We entrusted it to you to show

362
00:20:10,282 --> 00:20:12,928
that we are friends.

363
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:14,491
I don't have any friends.

364
00:20:15,847 --> 00:20:17,323
Not among the living.

365
00:20:17,365 --> 00:20:19,611
But we are your friends.

366
00:20:19,653 --> 00:20:21,558
You are one of us now.

367
00:20:22,732 --> 00:20:24,376
What do you want from me?

368
00:20:24,418 --> 00:20:26,749
There's a lot of work to do.

369
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:31,433
You can help us to deliver justice.

370
00:20:35,877 --> 00:20:38,687
Let us remember Isaiah 57,

371
00:20:39,999 --> 00:20:43,652
"the righteous perish and
no one takes it to heart.

372
00:20:44,814 --> 00:20:47,441
"The merciful are taken away

373
00:20:47,483 --> 00:20:51,305
"and no one understands that
the righteous are taken away

374
00:20:51,347 --> 00:20:53,871
"to be spared from the evil to come.

375
00:20:57,411 --> 00:20:59,416
"He shall enter into peace.

376
00:21:00,918 --> 00:21:03,122
"They shall rest in their beds.

377
00:21:03,975 --> 00:21:07,431
"Each one walking in their uprightness."

378
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:16,028
Marcus, may you find
rest as you lie in death.

379
00:21:17,823 --> 00:21:21,822
And walking uprightly, enter into peace.

380
00:21:32,029 --> 00:21:32,936
Hello.

381
00:21:32,978 --> 00:21:33,955
James Savini?

382
00:21:33,997 --> 00:21:36,364
You're the brother of the deceased, right?

383
00:21:36,406 --> 00:21:37,681
Yeah, who are you?

384
00:21:37,723 --> 00:21:40,808
Alice Jones, reporter
for the Daily Beacon.

385
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:41,799
The Daily Beacon.

386
00:21:43,297 --> 00:21:45,103
You guys really made a
media circus out of this.

387
00:21:45,145 --> 00:21:47,482
Why do you think I tried to
keep the service private?

388
00:21:47,524 --> 00:21:49,680
Well, we and the press
do try to walk a tightrope

389
00:21:49,722 --> 00:21:51,558
between respecting individual privacy

390
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,885
and serving the needs of the community.

391
00:21:53,927 --> 00:21:55,463
The community.

392
00:21:55,505 --> 00:21:56,852
What community?

393
00:21:56,894 --> 00:21:58,360
Marcus was shunned.

394
00:21:58,402 --> 00:22:00,129
He was harassed by college students.

395
00:22:00,171 --> 00:22:01,287
The only thing that made him part

396
00:22:01,329 --> 00:22:03,825
of the community was that
he was killed in public.

397
00:22:03,867 --> 00:22:05,583
I understand your feelings, sir.

398
00:22:05,625 --> 00:22:07,061
In fact, I'm trying to help.

399
00:22:07,103 --> 00:22:08,210
Help how?

400
00:22:08,252 --> 00:22:10,138
What are you gonna do
now that Marcus is gone?

401
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:12,147
We can tell his story so this kind

402
00:22:12,189 --> 00:22:13,895
of thing won't happen again.

403
00:22:13,937 --> 00:22:16,334
No, you're just trying
to cash in on a tragedy

404
00:22:16,376 --> 00:22:18,150
so you can get clicks and subscriptions.

405
00:22:18,192 --> 00:22:20,118
I'm not gonna help you
exploit my brother's death.

406
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,827
That's not it at all.

407
00:22:21,869 --> 00:22:23,545
This is bigger than Marcus.

408
00:22:23,587 --> 00:22:24,823
This is about Donville.

409
00:22:24,865 --> 00:22:28,160
You think this is the first
time people have been harmed

410
00:22:28,202 --> 00:22:29,401
and it's been hushed up.

411
00:22:30,509 --> 00:22:32,141
If we can tell his story,

412
00:22:33,017 --> 00:22:35,004
then the people in this
town will know how deep

413
00:22:35,046 --> 00:22:38,250
the problems are and maybe we can start

414
00:22:38,292 --> 00:22:39,913
to change people's attitudes.

415
00:22:43,986 --> 00:22:45,085
Here's my card.

416
00:22:46,104 --> 00:22:48,012
If you change your mind and wanna talk,

417
00:22:48,054 --> 00:22:49,443
just give me a call.

418
00:22:51,059 --> 00:22:51,891
I'm sorry for your loss, Mr. Savini

419
00:23:05,635 --> 00:23:08,240
[inaudible]

420
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:33,274
Hey, this is that kid Marcus' place.

421
00:23:33,316 --> 00:23:34,365
Who the hell are you?

422
00:23:35,544 --> 00:23:36,863
I'm his brother.

423
00:23:36,905 --> 00:23:38,204
I'm here to get his stuff.

424
00:23:40,149 --> 00:23:41,347
Well I'm his landlord.

425
00:23:42,196 --> 00:23:43,898
You got one week.

426
00:24:07,299 --> 00:24:08,418
[door knocking]

427
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:09,292
Come in.

428
00:24:12,057 --> 00:24:13,194
James, is it?

429
00:24:13,236 --> 00:24:15,032
You're Marcus' brother, right?

430
00:24:15,074 --> 00:24:16,435
Uh, yeah.

431
00:24:17,371 --> 00:24:18,228
Who are you?

432
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:19,060
I'm Amy.

433
00:24:19,102 --> 00:24:19,935
I live next door.

434
00:24:21,477 --> 00:24:22,773
Oh, that's right.

435
00:24:22,815 --> 00:24:24,042
I saw you at the funeral yesterday.

436
00:24:24,084 --> 00:24:26,540
I didn't realize Marcus had any friends.

437
00:24:26,582 --> 00:24:28,767
Yeah, unfortunately, not
everyone in this town cares

438
00:24:28,809 --> 00:24:30,520
about disabled people like Marcus.

439
00:24:31,396 --> 00:24:32,553
No shit.

440
00:24:32,595 --> 00:24:34,221
Why haven't I seen
you around here before?

441
00:24:34,263 --> 00:24:35,751
You know, to visit him.

442
00:24:35,793 --> 00:24:37,849
Marcus and I never really got along.

443
00:24:37,891 --> 00:24:40,216
Plus, I have to take care of our sick mom.

444
00:24:40,258 --> 00:24:41,487
She's probably gonna get even sicker

445
00:24:41,529 --> 00:24:43,043
now that my brother's gone.

446
00:24:44,932 --> 00:24:46,838
[Amy screaming]

447
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,046
It stuck me.

448
00:24:49,142 --> 00:24:51,722
[spooky music]

449
00:24:53,754 --> 00:24:54,586
What's this?

450
00:24:56,391 --> 00:24:58,357
Clowns and circuses.

451
00:24:58,399 --> 00:25:01,034
He was so obsessed with
clowns and circuses.

452
00:25:01,076 --> 00:25:02,976
I never knew why.

453
00:25:08,493 --> 00:25:09,963
Why would he have something like this

454
00:25:10,005 --> 00:25:10,795
in the apartment?

455
00:25:10,837 --> 00:25:13,042
He was never a violent person.

456
00:25:13,084 --> 00:25:15,369
Well, maybe he was on the inside.

457
00:25:15,411 --> 00:25:18,408
[music box playing]

458
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:23,932
[Music Box] killer

459
00:25:23,974 --> 00:25:25,120
Look, I wanna get out of there.

460
00:25:25,162 --> 00:25:25,980
This place is too depressing.

461
00:25:26,022 --> 00:25:27,024
If you wanna talk some more,

462
00:25:27,066 --> 00:25:27,983
my place is next door.

463
00:25:28,025 --> 00:25:29,441
Yeah, for sure.

464
00:25:32,398 --> 00:25:34,978
[spooky music]

465
00:25:42,473 --> 00:25:45,276
So how long have you known my brother?

466
00:25:45,318 --> 00:25:46,988
For a while now.

467
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:48,347
I see.

468
00:25:48,389 --> 00:25:50,306
I wish I did too.

469
00:25:50,348 --> 00:25:52,283
Once he moved, everything
kind of fell apart.

470
00:25:52,325 --> 00:25:54,376
Yeah, sometimes things happen.

471
00:25:55,681 --> 00:25:56,513
They sure do.

472
00:25:57,449 --> 00:25:58,756
He was a good guy.

473
00:25:58,798 --> 00:26:00,484
A handful.

474
00:26:00,526 --> 00:26:03,257
Yeah, but a good guy nonetheless.

475
00:26:03,299 --> 00:26:04,824
It's just so stupid.

476
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:08,106
I'd argue with him over little things.

477
00:26:08,148 --> 00:26:10,429
Things that just seemed
so insignificant now.

478
00:26:11,316 --> 00:26:12,384
I miss him too.

479
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:15,000
It sucks.

480
00:26:15,042 --> 00:26:18,311
I just feel like I failed
my role as his brother.

481
00:26:21,045 --> 00:26:23,058
Anyway, thanks for the drink.

482
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:24,639
No problem.

483
00:26:24,681 --> 00:26:25,967
I'll talk to you?

484
00:26:26,009 --> 00:26:27,217
Yeah, for sure.

485
00:26:27,259 --> 00:26:28,725
If you need anything, let me know.

486
00:26:28,767 --> 00:26:29,599
Sure.

487
00:26:38,148 --> 00:26:40,144
So I'm telling this fucking guy,

488
00:26:40,186 --> 00:26:41,990
I'm like, this is it, all right.

489
00:26:42,032 --> 00:26:44,275
I'm done playing around.

490
00:26:44,317 --> 00:26:47,296
If you keep bugging me about this shit,

491
00:26:47,338 --> 00:26:49,045
here's what's gonna happen.

492
00:26:49,087 --> 00:26:51,357
I'm gonna bash your fucking skull in.

493
00:26:52,213 --> 00:26:53,466
I'm done fucking playing.

494
00:26:53,508 --> 00:26:55,158
As you should.

495
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,417
I mean, it's not my fault

496
00:26:56,459 --> 00:26:59,505
that your fucking slutty
girlfriend keeps hitting on me.

497
00:26:59,547 --> 00:27:00,729
What?

498
00:27:00,771 --> 00:27:01,561
You can't satisfy your bitch

499
00:27:01,603 --> 00:27:03,460
and she comes rubbing up on my dick.

500
00:27:03,502 --> 00:27:04,749
That's on you, pal.

501
00:27:04,791 --> 00:27:06,407
I mean, grow a dick and fuck her right

502
00:27:06,449 --> 00:27:08,765
or grow some balls and
put your dog on a leash.

503
00:27:08,807 --> 00:27:10,803
Either way, I got 99 problems

504
00:27:10,845 --> 00:27:12,691
and your bitch ain't one of 'em.

505
00:27:12,733 --> 00:27:13,523
Fuck.

506
00:27:13,565 --> 00:27:14,479
I don't know, man.

507
00:27:14,521 --> 00:27:17,256
I always found you kind of attractive.

508
00:27:17,298 --> 00:27:18,819
Yeah, I bet you did, homo.

509
00:27:19,718 --> 00:27:20,562
You better watch out.

510
00:27:20,604 --> 00:27:22,571
You're getting Jerry all
hot and bothered over here.

511
00:27:22,613 --> 00:27:23,403
Can you guys quit it

512
00:27:23,445 --> 00:27:25,788
with the fucking faggot shit, already.

513
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:26,737
Yeah, Zack.

514
00:27:26,779 --> 00:27:29,334
I mean, when that retard
was kissing the dog,

515
00:27:29,376 --> 00:27:31,472
I bet you were really jealous of the dog.

516
00:27:31,514 --> 00:27:32,381
Am I right?

517
00:27:32,423 --> 00:27:35,567
Shut the fuck up, Elizabeth Jane.

518
00:27:35,609 --> 00:27:36,446
Oh yeah, Zack.

519
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:38,744
You're probably into all
kinds of shit, aren't you?

520
00:27:38,786 --> 00:27:41,022
Come on, tell us, we're your friends.

521
00:27:41,064 --> 00:27:42,783
Yeah, Zack, truth or dare.

522
00:27:42,825 --> 00:27:43,809
Fuck you guys, all right.

523
00:27:43,851 --> 00:27:46,600
I'm not the one who kissed
a fucking dog, all right.

524
00:27:46,642 --> 00:27:48,455
That retard didn't even know
what he was fucking doing,

525
00:27:48,497 --> 00:27:49,329
all right.

526
00:27:50,325 --> 00:27:52,341
I mean, at least he got a fucking kiss

527
00:27:52,383 --> 00:27:54,179
on his fucking birthday.

528
00:27:54,221 --> 00:27:57,945
You know what, fuck it,
it doesn't fucking matter.

529
00:27:57,987 --> 00:27:59,193
It's in the past.

530
00:27:59,235 --> 00:28:00,652
It seemed like a good idea at the time

531
00:28:00,694 --> 00:28:02,645
but I guess it wasn't.

532
00:28:03,541 --> 00:28:05,217
Yeah, you're full of those ideas.

533
00:28:05,259 --> 00:28:06,745
He sure is.

534
00:28:06,787 --> 00:28:08,004
Oh, my God.

535
00:28:08,046 --> 00:28:10,332
Cock sucking, asshole motherfuckers.

536
00:28:10,374 --> 00:28:13,072
It's not my fault that fucking
retard died, all right.

537
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:15,562
Not my fault.

538
00:28:16,538 --> 00:28:17,994
It was just a fucking joke.

539
00:28:18,036 --> 00:28:19,796
Hey Zack, chill out, man.

540
00:28:19,838 --> 00:28:21,451
It was an accident.

541
00:28:21,493 --> 00:28:22,695
He ran into fucking traffic.

542
00:28:22,737 --> 00:28:24,508
Yeah, and why'd he fucking do that, huh?

543
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:26,026
What do you mean, why?

544
00:28:26,068 --> 00:28:26,985
He was a retard.

545
00:28:27,027 --> 00:28:29,133
He didn't know what he was fucking doing.

546
00:28:29,175 --> 00:28:31,860
Who fucking invited him, huh, Liz?

547
00:28:31,902 --> 00:28:32,859
Dude!

548
00:28:32,901 --> 00:28:34,518
[Jerry] Hey, come on, calm down now.

549
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,306
Why are you being such a fucking SJW

550
00:28:36,348 --> 00:28:37,615
all of a fucking sudden?

551
00:28:37,657 --> 00:28:39,503
What, you feel bad for
fucking retards now?

552
00:28:39,545 --> 00:28:40,462
Fuck no.

553
00:28:40,504 --> 00:28:42,140
Look, I'm just fucking saying, all right.

554
00:28:42,182 --> 00:28:42,972
No.

555
00:28:43,014 --> 00:28:45,217
Then stop blaming this on my fucking girl.

556
00:28:45,259 --> 00:28:46,086
We were all there.

557
00:28:46,128 --> 00:28:47,576
We were all in this together.

558
00:28:49,194 --> 00:28:51,330
So we're just supposed
to fucking carry on

559
00:28:51,372 --> 00:28:53,068
like nothing ever fucking happened?

560
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:54,707
Zack, this is Donville.

561
00:28:54,749 --> 00:28:55,955
There's nowhere to fucking go.

562
00:28:55,997 --> 00:28:57,943
We're fucking stuck here.

563
00:28:57,985 --> 00:29:01,950
So it just doesn't matter, huh?

564
00:29:01,992 --> 00:29:02,799
It's over.

565
00:29:02,841 --> 00:29:04,442
Marcus is gone.

566
00:29:05,378 --> 00:29:08,093
Right, he's gone, man.

567
00:29:08,135 --> 00:29:09,737
Hey, but we're still here.

568
00:29:10,573 --> 00:29:12,199
We're normal fucking people.

569
00:29:12,241 --> 00:29:15,311
Those other people is not
our fucking problem, right?

570
00:29:18,245 --> 00:29:19,391
I guess you guys are right.

571
00:29:19,433 --> 00:29:21,359
I don't know what I was fucking thinking.

572
00:29:21,401 --> 00:29:22,899
Look, I'll be back in a couple of minutes.

573
00:29:22,941 --> 00:29:24,839
I gotta piss like a fucking racehorse.

574
00:29:25,978 --> 00:29:26,768
You want me to hold it?

575
00:29:26,810 --> 00:29:29,112
You know what, maybe you should.

576
00:29:29,154 --> 00:29:31,609
The doctor said no heavy
lifting for me [chuckling].

577
00:29:35,176 --> 00:29:40,171
[night crawlers singing]
[footsteps crunching]

578
00:29:47,311 --> 00:29:48,660
- [spooky laughing]
- Jerry,

579
00:29:49,793 --> 00:29:52,790
I swear, if that's you, I'm
gonna piss in your faggot mouth.

580
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:57,233
[spooky laughing]

581
00:29:57,275 --> 00:29:59,356
Jerry, I swear to fucking God.

582
00:30:00,282 --> 00:30:04,601
Oh shit, it's you in the flesh.

583
00:30:04,643 --> 00:30:07,538
[spooky circus music]
I thought you died, retard.

584
00:30:10,732 --> 00:30:13,632
Oh, my God, you look
even dumber than before.

585
00:30:15,121 --> 00:30:17,216
I didn't think that was possible.

586
00:30:17,258 --> 00:30:20,088
[Marcus grunting]

587
00:30:22,999 --> 00:30:24,755
You know what, retard?

588
00:30:24,797 --> 00:30:28,275
I'm gonna kill you and this
time you're gonna stay dead.

589
00:30:28,317 --> 00:30:30,981

591
00:30:35,347 --> 00:30:36,596
Son of a bitch.

592
00:30:38,193 --> 00:30:40,390
You're doing a fine job, Marcus,

593
00:30:40,432 --> 00:30:42,163
just like we discussed.

594
00:30:43,109 --> 00:30:45,085
I'd piss in his mouth.

595
00:30:45,127 --> 00:30:47,772
Unless you're not into that sort of thing.

596
00:30:47,814 --> 00:30:49,063
Cut the fucker.

597
00:30:50,391 --> 00:30:51,813
Wait, wait.

598
00:30:52,666 --> 00:30:53,456
We can be friends.

599
00:30:53,498 --> 00:30:55,039
I promise, I promise [yelping].

600
00:30:59,210 --> 00:31:00,042
My hand.

601
00:31:01,555 --> 00:31:04,473
You cock sucking, asshole, motherfucker.

602
00:31:04,515 --> 00:31:07,595
My hand [screaming].

603
00:31:10,601 --> 00:31:13,075
Yeah, now he's only
got one hand [chuckling].

604
00:31:15,126 --> 00:31:19,240
Oh, sorry.
[spooky music]

605
00:31:19,282 --> 00:31:21,692

00:31:32,567 --> 00:31:35,538
[chuckling] Who's the
Kool-Aid man now, asshole?

608
00:31:38,859 --> 00:31:40,633
Hey, what's up, guys?

609
00:31:41,909 --> 00:31:42,741
What's up?

610
00:31:43,742 --> 00:31:45,889
- [spooky laughing]
- What the fuck is that?

611
00:31:47,556 --> 00:31:49,745
It's probably just Zack
being a fucking dick.

612
00:31:49,787 --> 00:31:51,785
Stop being such a pussy.

613
00:31:53,727 --> 00:31:55,998
Yeah, I guess you're probably right.

614
00:31:57,381 --> 00:31:59,212

[Liz screaming]

616
00:32:08,362 --> 00:32:10,708
[Radio Announcer] High
school radio station HBFM,

617
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:13,795
founded in 1986 will cease operation

618
00:32:13,837 --> 00:32:16,812
at the end of the school
year, due to budget cuts.

619
00:32:16,854 --> 00:32:19,549
Donville's football program
will not be affected

620
00:32:19,591 --> 00:32:20,475
by these cuts.

621
00:32:20,517 --> 00:32:23,475
And HBFM is expected to
provide full coverage

622
00:32:23,517 --> 00:32:25,123
of the final game of the season

623
00:32:25,165 --> 00:32:26,446
before shutting down.

624
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:30,597
[ticker tape music]

625
00:32:33,776 --> 00:32:36,112
This just in, a Donville College student

626
00:32:36,154 --> 00:32:38,754
has been found dead in Legacy Park.

627
00:32:39,591 --> 00:32:41,956
Adam Griffin has more on the story.

628
00:32:41,998 --> 00:32:43,594
Adam.

629
00:32:43,636 --> 00:32:47,470
The young man has been
identified as Zachary Landi.

630
00:32:47,512 --> 00:32:50,777
Three HCC classmates of his are in shock

631
00:32:50,819 --> 00:32:53,354
over the incident that
the police are now calling

632
00:32:53,396 --> 00:32:55,232
a homicide.

633
00:32:55,274 --> 00:32:58,919
We were just hanging out by the campfire

634
00:32:58,961 --> 00:33:01,501
when Zach said he was just
going to the bathroom.

635
00:33:02,657 --> 00:33:05,621
And then we heard this voice.

636
00:33:05,663 --> 00:33:07,550
That's the fucking bitch
that got Marcus killed.

637
00:33:07,592 --> 00:33:08,424
Heads up.

638
00:33:09,387 --> 00:33:12,555
And then a [bleeping] head
just came flying in the fire.

639
00:33:12,597 --> 00:33:13,893
Can we just get the [bleeping] cameras

640
00:33:13,935 --> 00:33:15,711
out of our face right now?

641
00:33:15,753 --> 00:33:17,979
Now the police say they have no suspects

642
00:33:18,021 --> 00:33:22,225
as of yet but are continuing
their search into this matter.

643
00:33:22,267 --> 00:33:23,419

[Marcus] Nowhere.

00:34:19,741 --> 00:34:20,845
Where is it?

654
00:34:20,887 --> 00:34:22,136
I don't know.

00:34:46,778 --> 00:34:48,072
What book?

664
00:34:48,114 --> 00:34:49,031

He doesn't know.

668
00:34:56,021 --> 00:34:57,847
What do you think, Marcus?

669
00:34:57,889 --> 00:34:59,615
Want me to spare him?

670
00:35:00,474 --> 00:35:03,221
No [laughing].

Open the fucking door [knocking].

I don't have my phone.

693
00:36:38,131 --> 00:36:39,894
Amy, what's going on?

694
00:36:39,936 --> 00:36:40,783
Great, an interrogation.

695
00:36:40,825 --> 00:36:42,172
My building was burned.

696
00:36:42,214 --> 00:36:43,730
There's a man burned alive.

697
00:36:43,772 --> 00:36:45,019
I don't have my fucking phone.

698
00:36:45,061 --> 00:36:46,707
I need a goddamned phone.

699
00:36:46,749 --> 00:36:48,297
Okay, okay, it's right there.

700
00:36:49,262 --> 00:36:50,866

701
00:36:50,908 --> 00:36:51,741

702
00:36:56,236 --> 00:36:57,068
Amy?

703
00:37:02,074 --> 00:37:04,289
Amy, I'm not gonna pound the door down

704
00:37:04,331 --> 00:37:06,117
but I need you to talk to me.

705
00:37:06,159 --> 00:37:08,830
I wanna help but I can't
do that if you shut me out.

706
00:37:10,724 --> 00:37:13,078
My friend Marcus died,

707
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:15,742
the boy that lives next door from me,

708
00:37:16,868 --> 00:37:18,429
right after you dumped me.

709
00:37:19,585 --> 00:37:20,557
Oh, my God, Amy.

710
00:37:21,593 --> 00:37:24,634
Some college kids, they
played a prank on him.

711
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:27,126
And then he ran away from them

712
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:28,370
and he got hit by a car.

713
00:37:34,637 --> 00:37:36,581
And it hasn't stopped there.

714
00:37:38,126 --> 00:37:39,968
One of those kids got killed.

715
00:37:41,753 --> 00:37:44,238
And then there was a fire at our building

716
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,627
and there was a man burned alive.

717
00:37:45,669 --> 00:37:47,508
I think it was our old landlord

718
00:37:48,646 --> 00:37:52,131
but I couldn't tell.

719
00:37:52,173 --> 00:37:53,564
I'm so sorry.

720
00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:56,546
I'm here for you, anything you need.

721
00:37:56,588 --> 00:37:58,195
Open the door.

722
00:37:58,237 --> 00:37:59,236
- Kelly.
- Amy.

723
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:02,025
- Amy.
- Kelly.

724
00:38:05,406 --> 00:38:07,340
I just need you to hold me.

725
00:38:11,227 --> 00:38:13,575
- Calm down, Amy.
- I'm sorry.

726
00:38:13,617 --> 00:38:14,709
Amy, calm down.

727
00:38:14,751 --> 00:38:15,541
I'm right here.

728
00:38:15,583 --> 00:38:20,578
I'm so sorry.
[Amy crying]

729
00:38:22,655 --> 00:38:24,403
Breathe through this.

730
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:26,589
I'm right here.

731
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:32,607
[birds chirping]

732
00:38:52,939 --> 00:38:53,771
Marcus?

733
00:38:55,809 --> 00:38:56,641
Marcus?

734
00:38:58,285 --> 00:38:59,427
Marcus?

735
00:38:59,469 --> 00:39:02,299
[spooky laughing]

736
00:39:14,776 --> 00:39:15,608
Amy?

737
00:39:17,253 --> 00:39:18,792
You okay?

738
00:39:18,834 --> 00:39:23,483
Yeah, I just had a crazy dream.

739
00:39:25,538 --> 00:39:26,886
What did you dream about?

740
00:39:28,185 --> 00:39:29,447
My friend, Marcus.

741
00:39:30,802 --> 00:39:33,133
But it wasn't Marcus.

742
00:39:35,527 --> 00:39:37,908
He was evil.

743
00:39:40,763 --> 00:39:42,027
And laughing.

744
00:39:44,298 --> 00:39:46,676
First, he was crying and then laughing.

745
00:39:47,970 --> 00:39:49,219
I don't get it.

746
00:39:50,364 --> 00:39:51,161
Don't worry about it.

747
00:39:51,203 --> 00:39:52,983
Just go back to bed.

748
00:39:53,025 --> 00:39:54,273
It's all right.

749
00:40:09,252 --> 00:40:10,181
Hello?

750
00:40:10,223 --> 00:40:11,619
What the hell is this?

751
00:40:11,661 --> 00:40:13,837
Sir, it's a crime scene.

752
00:40:13,879 --> 00:40:15,195
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you to-

753
00:40:15,237 --> 00:40:16,404
- This is my brother's apartment, man.

754
00:40:16,446 --> 00:40:17,797
- What happened?
- Fire.

755
00:40:18,903 --> 00:40:19,735
Fire.

756
00:40:20,781 --> 00:40:22,917
That's some next level CSI deduction.

757
00:40:22,959 --> 00:40:25,541
I thought the landlord just
did a fucking lousy paint job.

758
00:40:25,583 --> 00:40:27,712
The landlord's dead, smart ass.

759
00:40:27,754 --> 00:40:31,213
He was taken out of here
yesterday, burnt to a crisp.

760
00:40:32,978 --> 00:40:33,828
What about Amy?

761
00:40:34,917 --> 00:40:36,114
Neighbor?

762
00:40:36,156 --> 00:40:37,572
We don't know.

763
00:40:37,614 --> 00:40:39,061
The door was left open.

764
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:40,352
She hasn't been home yet.

765
00:40:48,893 --> 00:40:50,499
You okay?

766
00:40:50,541 --> 00:40:51,373
Yeah.

767
00:40:52,302 --> 00:40:53,134
I'm okay.

768
00:40:54,317 --> 00:40:56,442
You've been through a lot.

769
00:40:56,484 --> 00:40:57,483
I'll be all right.

770
00:41:00,092 --> 00:41:03,581
So where are we now?

771
00:41:04,707 --> 00:41:07,667
- What, you and me?
- Um-hmm.

772
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:13,386
Do you think we need some time apart?

773
00:41:13,428 --> 00:41:14,504
Do you?

774
00:41:14,546 --> 00:41:15,428
I asked you.

775
00:41:17,413 --> 00:41:19,211
Sorry, I made all this shit worse.

776
00:41:20,637 --> 00:41:21,497
You must really hate me.

777
00:41:21,539 --> 00:41:22,857
No.

778
00:41:22,899 --> 00:41:25,740
No, you were here for
me when I needed you.

779
00:41:25,782 --> 00:41:28,106
I appreciate that so much.

780
00:41:29,472 --> 00:41:31,048
I do have to go.

781
00:41:31,090 --> 00:41:33,435
Do you have my shoes still?

782
00:41:33,477 --> 00:41:34,949
Yeah, they're in the closet.

783
00:41:36,264 --> 00:41:37,247
I love you.

784
00:41:37,289 --> 00:41:38,121
Thank you.

785
00:41:48,173 --> 00:41:50,403
Still love you, grad school girl.

786
00:41:51,889 --> 00:41:54,614
Please call me if you need anything.

787
00:41:54,656 --> 00:41:55,843
I will.

788
00:41:55,885 --> 00:41:57,573
- I love you too.
- Love you.

00:43:29,504 --> 00:43:34,499
Boo!
[spooky laughing]

793
00:43:35,553 --> 00:43:38,723
Shit, I need to get different weed.

794
00:43:54,474 --> 00:43:57,559
Jerry, did you get that
medicine that I need?

795
00:43:57,601 --> 00:43:59,342
Yes, Aunt Debbie.

796
00:44:01,445 --> 00:44:04,025
[spooky music]

797
00:44:12,761 --> 00:44:15,591

[woman screaming]

800
00:44:28,492 --> 00:44:30,913
[Debbie] Jerry, could
you turn that down?

801
00:44:30,955 --> 00:44:32,498
I'm trying to rest.

802
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:33,648
[woman screaming]

803
00:44:33,690 --> 00:44:35,695
Did you hear what I said?

804
00:44:35,737 --> 00:44:37,319
Yes, I heard you.

805
00:44:44,518 --> 00:44:47,265
[Bell jingling]

806
00:44:54,186 --> 00:44:56,244
Stop clowning around.

807
00:44:58,774 --> 00:45:01,764
[spooky music]

808
00:45:01,806 --> 00:45:04,560
[Mr. Punch] No, we've only started.

809
00:45:07,528 --> 00:45:10,192
[woman whining]

810
00:45:17,769 --> 00:45:19,555
What do you think, Marcus?

811
00:45:19,597 --> 00:45:22,023
One less bat in our belfry.

812
00:45:22,065 --> 00:45:23,422
I don't know her.

813
00:45:23,464 --> 00:45:25,390
She's done nothing to me.

814
00:45:25,432 --> 00:45:26,628
But this is where that kid lives.

815
00:45:26,670 --> 00:45:28,097
I followed him here.

816
00:45:28,139 --> 00:45:30,444
So if she's the one raising him,

817
00:45:30,486 --> 00:45:33,069
then she's responsible too.

818
00:45:33,111 --> 00:45:35,429
I don't know.

819
00:45:35,471 --> 00:45:37,877
It has to be this way, Marcus.

820
00:45:37,919 --> 00:45:40,733
You think we didn't try compassion too?

821
00:45:40,775 --> 00:45:44,539
We did and look what happened to us.

822
00:45:44,581 --> 00:45:46,304
We have to fight back.

823
00:45:47,439 --> 00:45:49,235
It's a cruel world, Marcus

824
00:45:49,277 --> 00:45:52,109
and we have to be just as cruel in return.

825
00:45:52,151 --> 00:45:54,590
Oh, cut it out, Rosco.

826
00:45:54,632 --> 00:45:59,323
Cut it out, that's an excellent idea.

827
00:46:02,257 --> 00:46:04,650
[Debbie screaming]

828
00:46:04,692 --> 00:46:05,858
Aunt Debbie?

00:46:07,302 --> 00:46:08,468
Fucking bitch.

830
00:46:10,633 --> 00:46:13,376
Aunt Debbie, could you please just go-

[spooky music]

832
00:46:24,233 --> 00:46:26,813
What's the matter, Jerry?

833
00:46:26,855 --> 00:46:30,023
I thought you liked
movies about killer clowns.

834
00:46:30,065 --> 00:46:32,011
Here, have a whiff.

835
00:46:32,053 --> 00:46:35,017
[Jerry yelling]

[body thudding]

837
00:46:38,318 --> 00:46:41,023
That's him, right, Marcus?

838
00:46:41,065 --> 00:46:42,321
Yes.

839
00:46:42,363 --> 00:46:44,079
He must be punished.

840
00:46:44,121 --> 00:46:46,547
Do you understand now?

841
00:46:46,589 --> 00:46:48,045
I understand.

842
00:46:48,087 --> 00:46:50,418
Then do what must be done.

843
00:46:51,690 --> 00:46:56,685
[head squishing]
[clowns laughing]

844
00:47:27,446 --> 00:47:32,440
What?
[car skidding]

845
00:47:37,393 --> 00:47:40,557

[horn honking]

847
00:48:02,335 --> 00:48:04,128
Thank you for your patience ma'am

848
00:48:04,170 --> 00:48:06,026
and your assistance.

849
00:48:06,068 --> 00:48:07,404
No problem.

850
00:48:07,446 --> 00:48:10,165
You guys didn't take anything, did you?

851
00:48:10,207 --> 00:48:12,959
If I open up my Charmed box
set and there's a disc missing,

852
00:48:13,001 --> 00:48:15,157
- I know who to blame.
- What?

853
00:48:15,199 --> 00:48:16,206
Nothing, never mind.

854
00:48:16,248 --> 00:48:17,080
Have a good day.

855
00:48:21,925 --> 00:48:24,589
[phone ringing]

856
00:48:27,236 --> 00:48:30,481
Hello?
[phone ringing]

857
00:48:30,523 --> 00:48:33,648
Hello, James?

858
00:48:33,690 --> 00:48:35,002
Yeah, I just got back in.

859
00:48:36,487 --> 00:48:38,336
Yeah, the whole thing's unbelievable.

860
00:48:39,444 --> 00:48:41,740
Sure, I can meet.

861
00:48:41,782 --> 00:48:42,614
How soon?

862
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:45,276
Okay, I'll see you.

863
00:48:45,318 --> 00:48:46,150
Bye.

864
00:48:51,721 --> 00:48:54,207
I just get a bad feeling off this book.

865
00:48:54,249 --> 00:48:55,955
I've no idea where Marcus found it,

866
00:48:55,997 --> 00:48:57,801
but he had it on him when he died.

867
00:49:06,190 --> 00:49:07,738
I saw that clown.

868
00:49:09,404 --> 00:49:10,361
What do you mean?

869
00:49:10,403 --> 00:49:12,358
I saw him recently.

870
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:13,457
Where?

871
00:49:13,499 --> 00:49:15,375
That house on Castle Avenue.

872
00:49:15,417 --> 00:49:16,814
He was standing on the front lawn

873
00:49:16,856 --> 00:49:19,356
and he just disappeared
right in front of my face.

874
00:49:20,782 --> 00:49:24,307
You mean where the college
kid and his aunt lived?

875
00:49:24,349 --> 00:49:25,595
The two people that were murdered.

876
00:49:25,637 --> 00:49:26,428
What?

877
00:49:26,470 --> 00:49:27,533
When?

878
00:49:27,575 --> 00:49:28,964
Amy, didn't you hear?

879
00:49:30,053 --> 00:49:32,531
Can I borrow this book for a day or so?

880
00:49:32,573 --> 00:49:34,616
I mean, I guess but why?

881
00:49:34,658 --> 00:49:36,034
Because I know there's a connection

882
00:49:36,076 --> 00:49:38,124
between them and I'm gonna figure it out.

883
00:49:41,431 --> 00:49:42,807
This is the clown.

884
00:49:42,849 --> 00:49:45,165
I swear, that's the clown I saw.

885
00:49:46,838 --> 00:49:50,002
[spooky circus music]

886
00:49:51,059 --> 00:49:54,499
Oh my God, that's the guy that I saw.

887
00:49:54,541 --> 00:49:56,481
That must be his nephew.

888
00:49:56,523 --> 00:50:00,786
Peter's uncle, John
Bannon, is a performer.

889
00:50:00,828 --> 00:50:05,823
Rosco.
[dramatic music]

890
00:50:07,610 --> 00:50:09,526
What's the connection?

891
00:50:10,582 --> 00:50:14,827
Three clown performers
arrested in child abuse.

892
00:50:23,830 --> 00:50:26,993
[spooky circus music]

893
00:50:46,584 --> 00:50:49,248
[door knocking]

894
00:50:54,083 --> 00:50:54,873
Hey, Dan.

895
00:50:54,915 --> 00:50:56,392
How's my favorite brother doing?

896
00:50:56,434 --> 00:50:57,267
Good.

897
00:50:59,402 --> 00:51:00,279
You're here early.

898
00:51:00,321 --> 00:51:01,518
Where's Mom?

899
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:04,844
She's in a hurry to get to the airport.

900
00:51:04,886 --> 00:51:06,043
Yeah, I bet.

901
00:51:06,085 --> 00:51:07,981
- Well, come on in.
- Sure.

902
00:51:08,023 --> 00:51:09,222
Make yourself at home.

903
00:51:15,625 --> 00:51:17,691
I'm so glad you're here, Dan.

904
00:51:17,733 --> 00:51:20,018
You have no idea how glad.

905
00:51:20,060 --> 00:51:22,362
- Hey, Amy?
- Yes.

906
00:51:23,568 --> 00:51:25,479
I wish I could see Marcus again.

907
00:51:27,402 --> 00:51:28,880
I already miss him.

908
00:51:28,922 --> 00:51:29,754
I know.

909
00:51:30,610 --> 00:51:31,669
I miss him too.

910
00:51:32,558 --> 00:51:34,194
How did he die?

911
00:51:34,236 --> 00:51:35,443
Well, Dan,

912
00:51:35,485 --> 00:51:38,889
some very nasty people
pulled a prank on him

913
00:51:38,931 --> 00:51:40,847
and it got out of hand.

914
00:51:40,889 --> 00:51:42,451
You mean Liz and her friends?

915
00:51:43,317 --> 00:51:46,053
Yeah, how did you know that?

916
00:51:46,095 --> 00:51:49,524
Marcus, told me about them on Facebook.

917
00:51:49,566 --> 00:51:50,933
Oh, I see.

918
00:51:54,596 --> 00:51:58,245
Amy, why do those assholes
blame Marcus so much?

919
00:51:59,610 --> 00:52:02,116
Well, Dan, you see, there are a lot

920
00:52:02,158 --> 00:52:04,343
of nasty, bad people in this world

921
00:52:04,385 --> 00:52:07,240
and Marcus fell victim
to these bad people.

922
00:52:07,282 --> 00:52:11,207
But since Marcus died,
these bad people have

923
00:52:11,249 --> 00:52:12,341
been getting killed.

924
00:52:13,746 --> 00:52:18,120
But Dan, not everyone's bad and nasty.

925
00:52:18,162 --> 00:52:19,663
Just look at me and Mom.

926
00:52:20,541 --> 00:52:22,755
I don't know about our mom.

927
00:52:22,797 --> 00:52:24,868
She calls me a dyke at home sometimes.

928
00:52:28,391 --> 00:52:30,986
Amy, I'm sorry.

929
00:52:31,028 --> 00:52:32,985
I didn't mean to get you upset.

930
00:52:33,027 --> 00:52:36,901
It's okay, it's not your fault.

931
00:52:36,943 --> 00:52:39,503
I just had a really
shitty week, that's all.

932
00:52:43,826 --> 00:52:45,022
I'll tell you what?

933
00:52:45,064 --> 00:52:47,240
Is there a particular
movie you wanna go see?

934
00:52:47,282 --> 00:52:50,756
Yeah, the Peanut Butter Falcon.

935
00:52:50,798 --> 00:52:52,235
Oh yeah, isn't that the movie

936
00:52:52,277 --> 00:52:53,663
where the guys has Down's Syndrome

937
00:52:53,705 --> 00:52:56,126
- and becomes a pro wrestler?
- Yeah, it sure is.

938
00:52:57,003 --> 00:52:57,793
All right, then.

939
00:52:57,835 --> 00:52:59,488
Well, I'll go look at the show times

940
00:52:59,530 --> 00:53:01,816
and we can see something
that will change our mood.

941
00:53:01,858 --> 00:53:03,056
Yeah.

942
00:53:03,098 --> 00:53:06,226
I do one day wanna become a wrestler too,

943
00:53:07,182 --> 00:53:09,358
just like The Undertaker.

944
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:10,626
Oh yeah.

945
00:53:10,668 --> 00:53:15,077
We'll see, maybe.

Can you believe they
still screen this old shit?

952
00:53:48,604 --> 00:53:50,931
It is an indie theater.

953
00:53:51,838 --> 00:53:53,643
So, this shit's so outdated.

954
00:53:53,685 --> 00:53:54,662
At least if they served beer here,

955
00:53:54,704 --> 00:53:56,530
I could pour one on the
curb for Zach and Jerry.

956
00:53:56,572 --> 00:53:59,329
Can we not talk about that?

957
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:03,279
Okay.

958
00:54:03,321 --> 00:54:05,690
Remind me why we couldn't
go to another theater

959
00:54:05,732 --> 00:54:06,629
to see the new Rambo.

960
00:54:06,671 --> 00:54:10,566
Like the AMC, at least
it has reclining chairs.

961
00:54:10,608 --> 00:54:13,782
Because it's only in
select theaters now.

962
00:54:13,824 --> 00:54:17,538
And besides, the AMC is too far away

963
00:54:17,580 --> 00:54:19,112
and we don't have a car,

964
00:54:20,138 --> 00:54:23,167
so we have to see what's here in Donville.

965
00:54:25,132 --> 00:54:29,016
Whatever, this shit's so old,
it should just be forgotten.

966
00:54:29,058 --> 00:54:31,329
Great, fucking power's out now.

967
00:54:33,485 --> 00:54:34,583
It's an old theater.

968
00:54:35,432 --> 00:54:36,631
I'm sure they'll fix it.

969
00:54:37,690 --> 00:54:38,480
They better.

970
00:54:38,522 --> 00:54:40,345
We paid to go see this damn thing.

971
00:54:40,387 --> 00:54:42,113
Don't worry about it, Brad.

972
00:54:42,155 --> 00:54:44,915
I'm here alone, in the dark, with you.

973
00:54:45,911 --> 00:54:46,743
I feel safe.

974
00:54:48,443 --> 00:54:50,504
Shh, guess who?

975
00:54:50,546 --> 00:54:53,451
Fuck you, dead man.

Brad?

985

Open the door.

986
00:55:16,562 --> 00:55:17,394
Hi, Liz.

987
00:55:18,919 --> 00:55:21,566
Marcus?
[spooky laughing]

988
00:55:21,608 --> 00:55:23,601
I missed my birthday, Liz.

989
00:55:23,643 --> 00:55:25,245
Still wanna celebrate?

990
00:55:26,261 --> 00:55:28,345
Yes, Marcus.

991
00:55:28,387 --> 00:55:30,443
We can go get some birthday cake.

992
00:55:30,485 --> 00:55:35,480
[laughing] Have some pie instead.

Hello!

1001
00:56:06,757 --> 00:56:10,783
Whoa, you scared the ba-Jesus out of me.

1002
00:56:10,825 --> 00:56:13,021
Well, how we doing, folks?

1003
00:56:13,063 --> 00:56:14,490
How can I do ye for today?

1004
00:56:14,532 --> 00:56:18,355
Hi, can we get two for
Peanut Butter Falcon, please?

1005
00:56:18,397 --> 00:56:20,353
Peanut Butter Falcon.

1006
00:56:20,395 --> 00:56:22,062
Well, as fine as of a movie as that is,

1007
00:56:22,104 --> 00:56:25,867
may I suggest Post-Apocalyptic
Commando Shark

1008
00:56:25,909 --> 00:56:28,525
or possibly Bloody Island,

1009
00:56:28,567 --> 00:56:30,664
if you wanna get really scared [laughing].

1010
00:56:32,493 --> 00:56:33,430
No, no thank you.

1011
00:56:33,472 --> 00:56:35,019
Just two for the uh,

1012
00:56:35,061 --> 00:56:36,677
no scary stuff for us.

1013
00:56:36,719 --> 00:56:37,998
If you insist.

1014
00:56:39,612 --> 00:56:41,412
- There you are, kids.
- Thank you.

1015
00:56:41,454 --> 00:56:43,002
- Enjoy the show.
- Thank you.

1016
00:56:48,992 --> 00:56:49,961
I can't wait to see this movie.

1017
00:56:50,003 --> 00:56:50,835
Yeah.

1018
00:56:52,425 --> 00:56:54,134
What do you want, kiddo.

1019
00:56:54,176 --> 00:56:56,666
I want popcorn and diet Coke.

1020
00:56:56,708 --> 00:56:59,289
[spooky music]

1021
00:57:02,676 --> 00:57:03,508
Marcus?

1022
00:57:12,230 --> 00:57:13,229
Holy shit!

1023
00:57:15,324 --> 00:57:18,154
[women screaming]

1024
00:57:24,592 --> 00:57:27,756

[police scanner chattering]

1027
00:57:49,816 --> 00:57:52,789
Well, you two were the first
to discover the deceased.

1028
00:57:52,831 --> 00:57:53,938
Can you tell me what you saw?

1029
00:57:53,980 --> 00:57:55,407
Ma'am, you first?

1030
00:57:55,449 --> 00:57:57,435
Well, my brother and
I, we were in the lobby

1031
00:57:57,477 --> 00:57:59,412
heading to see the Peanut Butter Falcon,

1032
00:57:59,454 --> 00:58:02,259
when I saw a fat clown in the hallway.

1033
00:58:02,301 --> 00:58:04,667
Wait a minute, did you say a fat clown?

1034
00:58:04,709 --> 00:58:06,545
Yes, I did, officer.

1035
00:58:06,587 --> 00:58:08,674
Ma'am, I've been interviewing
people here all night,

1036
00:58:08,716 --> 00:58:09,506
inside and out.

1037
00:58:09,548 --> 00:58:12,380
Nobody has mentioned anything
about seeing a clown.

1038
00:58:12,422 --> 00:58:13,808
That's impossible.

1039
00:58:13,850 --> 00:58:16,356
I swear to you, there was a clown.

1040
00:58:16,398 --> 00:58:18,693
Listen, I understand this
has been a shock to you

1041
00:58:18,735 --> 00:58:19,934
and your brother

1042
00:58:21,162 --> 00:58:24,237
but please try to take this
a little more seriously.

1043
00:58:24,279 --> 00:58:26,625
We get enough clown hoaxes.

1044
00:58:26,667 --> 00:58:28,023
I don't understand.

1045
00:58:28,065 --> 00:58:30,595
The clown was real, it had to be.

1046
00:58:37,595 --> 00:58:39,162
What about you, young man?

1047
00:58:39,204 --> 00:58:40,761
Did you see a clown?

1048
00:58:40,803 --> 00:58:44,000
No, officer, I did not.

1049
00:58:44,042 --> 00:58:45,251
Just the dead body.

1050
00:58:47,995 --> 00:58:50,331
Well, I've heard enough here.

1051
00:58:50,373 --> 00:58:52,508
Thank you for your cooperation.

1052
00:58:52,550 --> 00:58:53,449
Have a good night.

1053
00:58:54,428 --> 00:58:55,995
He's gonna think I'm crazy.

1054
00:58:56,037 --> 00:58:57,186
You didn't see a clown?

1055
00:58:58,285 --> 00:58:59,117
Nothing?

1056
00:59:01,292 --> 00:59:03,413
I'm telling you, James, I saw them.

1057
00:59:04,688 --> 00:59:07,423
I mean, you're saying
that you saw Marcus,

1058
00:59:07,465 --> 00:59:10,141
dressed as a clown,
together with another clown?

1059
00:59:10,183 --> 00:59:13,267
I said I saw Marcus but
I didn't say he was alive.

1060
00:59:13,309 --> 00:59:14,995
And you think that they're the ones

1061
00:59:15,037 --> 00:59:17,822
that killed Liz and the others?

1062
00:59:17,864 --> 00:59:19,381
Listen, I know it sounds crazy

1063
00:59:19,423 --> 00:59:21,230
since I'm the only one that saw them.

1064
00:59:21,272 --> 00:59:22,798
But I don't know what to do.

1065
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:24,896
Maybe seeing a therapist would help.

1066
00:59:24,938 --> 00:59:27,523
Look, I'm not saying that you're crazy.

1067
00:59:27,565 --> 00:59:29,521
A lot of people that
go through trauma talk

1068
00:59:29,563 --> 00:59:30,712
to therapists for help.

1069
00:59:33,209 --> 00:59:36,873
How's Dan doing since
yesterday's incident?

1070
00:59:36,915 --> 00:59:37,897
He's okay.

1071
00:59:39,023 --> 00:59:40,539
A little shaken up but okay.

1072
00:59:40,581 --> 00:59:42,767
He's watching wrestling to calm down.

1073
00:59:42,809 --> 00:59:44,716
That's what he loves to do.

1074
00:59:44,758 --> 00:59:45,548
How long is he staying with you for?

1075
00:59:45,590 --> 00:59:47,703
For about a week.

1076
00:59:47,745 --> 00:59:50,347
My mom and I, we don't get along.

1077
00:59:50,389 --> 00:59:53,050
Oh, how come, if I may ask?

1078
00:59:53,092 --> 00:59:57,827
- Because I'm a lesbian.
- Oh, I see.

1079
00:59:58,713 --> 01:00:00,200
Maybe you're right.

1080
01:00:00,242 --> 01:00:02,487
Maybe I do need some help.

1081
01:00:02,529 --> 01:00:04,915
Or maybe I just need to keep digging

1082
01:00:04,957 --> 01:00:08,617
on researching the history
of clowns in Donville.

1083
01:00:09,553 --> 01:00:11,109
I don't see how that's gonna help you.

1084
01:00:11,151 --> 01:00:13,656
Well, I like to face my trauma heads on.

1085
01:00:13,698 --> 01:00:16,009
What do you suggest, a trip to Florida?

1086
01:00:17,055 --> 01:00:18,082
Florida, no.

1087
01:00:18,124 --> 01:00:20,289
That place is a trauma zone,

1088
01:00:20,331 --> 01:00:22,817
especially since it's Trump
land rather than Disneyland.

1089
01:00:22,859 --> 01:00:24,607
You mean Disney World [laughing]?

1090
01:00:27,114 --> 01:00:29,531
Do you wanna hear the
definition of a clown?

1091
01:00:29,573 --> 01:00:31,058
Not really.

1092
01:00:31,100 --> 01:00:33,187
Well, I'm gonna tell you anyway.

1093
01:00:33,229 --> 01:00:35,524
It says, the clown is an archetype

1094
01:00:35,566 --> 01:00:37,232
that dates back centuries.

1095
01:00:37,274 --> 01:00:39,390
It is the character of a yokel,

1096
01:00:39,432 --> 01:00:41,618
a lowly, foolish laborer.

1097
01:00:41,660 --> 01:00:42,647
An underdog.

1098
01:00:42,689 --> 01:00:45,454
Someone simple-minded
for people to laugh at.

1099
01:00:45,496 --> 01:00:47,661
A related character is the tramp.

1100
01:00:47,703 --> 01:00:49,639
You know, like Charlie Chaplin?

1101
01:00:49,681 --> 01:00:51,148
Again, someone to laugh at because

1102
01:00:51,190 --> 01:00:52,471
of his lower status.

1103
01:00:53,447 --> 01:00:55,445
What's that?

1104
01:00:55,487 --> 01:00:56,995
You wanna know about any skeletons

1105
01:00:57,037 --> 01:00:58,136
in this town's history?

1106
01:00:59,015 --> 01:01:00,923
I think I know someone that can help us.

1107
01:01:02,069 --> 01:01:05,079
- Who is Alice Jones?
- A journalist.

1108
01:01:05,945 --> 01:01:07,194
Where did you meet her?

1109
01:01:08,293 --> 01:01:09,824
I thought you were a lesbian.

1110
01:01:13,233 --> 01:01:15,589
I was hoping you'd finally talk with me.

1111
01:01:15,631 --> 01:01:17,241
So what have you found out?

1112
01:01:17,283 --> 01:01:20,963
This newest wave of murders
happened in Legacy Park.

1113
01:01:22,534 --> 01:01:24,454
So, why is that significant?

1114
01:01:24,496 --> 01:01:25,286
Wait a minute.

1115
01:01:25,328 --> 01:01:27,341
I was researching this in my class.

1116
01:01:27,383 --> 01:01:28,950
That's where Tony Casey died.

1117
01:01:28,992 --> 01:01:30,987
Yeah, you're way ahead of me.

1118
01:01:31,029 --> 01:01:32,466
Guys, who's Tony Casey?

1119
01:01:32,508 --> 01:01:33,914
I don't think I've heard this story.

1120
01:01:33,956 --> 01:01:35,493
He was a teenager who killed himself

1121
01:01:35,535 --> 01:01:38,230
in the park back in the early 2000s.

1122
01:01:38,272 --> 01:01:39,520
He slit his own throat.

1123
01:01:40,538 --> 01:01:42,700
The police found his body in the park.

1124
01:01:43,816 --> 01:01:46,092
Then later it became known
that he was being harassed

1125
01:01:46,134 --> 01:01:47,501
and bullied for being gay

1126
01:01:47,543 --> 01:01:49,439
and that's probably why he killed himself.

1127
01:01:49,481 --> 01:01:50,811
This must've been before my time.

1128
01:01:50,853 --> 01:01:52,496
I don't even think I've heard of this.

1129
01:01:52,538 --> 01:01:54,424
Yeah, people stopped talking about it.

1130
01:01:54,466 --> 01:01:55,256
So what?

1131
01:01:55,298 --> 01:01:57,490
Just another lost piece
of Donville history?

1132
01:01:57,532 --> 01:01:58,759
It gets better.

1133
01:01:58,801 --> 01:02:02,675
Soon after his death, other
people started getting murdered.

1134
01:02:02,717 --> 01:02:04,833
They were really weird murders

1135
01:02:04,875 --> 01:02:07,293
and none of them were ever solved.

1136
01:02:07,335 --> 01:02:11,077
But all the murder
victims were homophobes.

1137
01:02:11,119 --> 01:02:13,405
People who had been
arrested for hate crimes

1138
01:02:13,447 --> 01:02:15,193
or who had voted against-

1139
01:02:15,235 --> 01:02:16,025
- Wait, wait, wait.

1140
01:02:16,067 --> 01:02:17,300
What does any of this have to do

1141
01:02:17,342 --> 01:02:19,958
with Marcus and the clowns?

1142
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,856
Marcus wasn't gay, as far as I know.

1143
01:02:21,898 --> 01:02:23,024
But he was different

1144
01:02:23,066 --> 01:02:24,912
and people in this town,
they don't like people

1145
01:02:24,954 --> 01:02:26,181
who are different.

1146
01:02:26,223 --> 01:02:28,558
And most of the time,
people who are different

1147
01:02:28,600 --> 01:02:30,097
don't dare fight back.

1148
01:02:30,139 --> 01:02:33,774
But what if something
fights back for them?

1149
01:02:33,816 --> 01:02:36,521
So you guys think that something

1150
01:02:36,563 --> 01:02:38,769
killed all those homophobes
in the early 2000s.

1151
01:02:38,811 --> 01:02:43,154
And that same something is now punishing

1152
01:02:43,196 --> 01:02:46,491
all the people who punished
Marcus for being disabled?

1153
01:02:46,533 --> 01:02:49,158
Yeah, that's what I'm leaning towards.

1154
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:51,006
Okay, but where's your proof?

1155
01:02:51,048 --> 01:02:53,153
When I was researching
clowns and circuses

1156
01:02:53,195 --> 01:02:56,100
in this area, I found an
article with a picture

1157
01:02:56,142 --> 01:02:57,820
of a circus troupe.

1158
01:02:57,862 --> 01:03:00,157
I recognized the clowns from the photo

1159
01:03:00,199 --> 01:03:01,631
that were in Marcus' book.

1160
01:03:04,674 --> 01:03:07,025
Here is a picture of the
leader of the troupe.

1161
01:03:08,001 --> 01:03:10,726
This is his nephew, Peter Bannon.

1162
01:03:10,768 --> 01:03:12,394
That's where I come in.

1163
01:03:12,436 --> 01:03:16,080
Peter Bannon's still alive
and still here in town.

1164
01:03:16,122 --> 01:03:18,178
I've been tracking him
and I think I know someone

1165
01:03:18,220 --> 01:03:19,282
who can get to him.

1166
01:03:20,311 --> 01:03:21,985
Who and how do we find this person?

1167
01:03:22,027 --> 01:03:23,925
Why do you think I chose this diner?

1168
01:03:25,963 --> 01:03:26,850
Will that be all folks?

1169
01:03:26,892 --> 01:03:27,869
Any dessert?

1170
01:03:27,911 --> 01:03:29,259
Nah, none for me, thanks.

1171
01:03:30,258 --> 01:03:31,125
Okay, then.

1172
01:03:31,167 --> 01:03:31,994
Here's your bill.

1173
01:03:32,036 --> 01:03:34,966
Actually, there is one
thing you could help us with.

1174
01:03:36,492 --> 01:03:39,097
What can you tell us about Peter Bannon?

1175
01:03:39,139 --> 01:03:40,625
Yeah, I saw an old news article.

1176
01:03:40,667 --> 01:03:43,053
He would be an old man by now.

1177
01:03:43,095 --> 01:03:44,792
No, I don't know anything about him.

1178
01:03:44,834 --> 01:03:45,896
I think you do.

1179
01:03:47,121 --> 01:03:49,662
This isn't the first time
I've asked you about him.

1180
01:03:50,528 --> 01:03:54,671
Now, will you help these nice people?

1181
01:03:54,713 --> 01:03:58,782
Peter Bannon [sighing], yeah.

1182
01:03:59,808 --> 01:04:01,304
I guess I remember him.

1183
01:04:01,346 --> 01:04:02,653
Do you know where he lives?

1184
01:04:02,695 --> 01:04:04,411
Yeah, but I wouldn't advise it.

1185
01:04:04,453 --> 01:04:06,024
He's not a nice guy.

1186
01:04:07,070 --> 01:04:08,458
Could you please tell us where he lives?

1187
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:09,432
It's important.

1188
01:04:10,817 --> 01:04:11,649
Well, okay.

1189
01:04:13,744 --> 01:04:15,542
But don't tell me I didn't warn you.

1190
01:04:16,769 --> 01:04:19,296
This is not a door you wanna open.

1191
01:04:19,338 --> 01:04:21,564
I'm a journalist, that's my job.

1192
01:04:21,606 --> 01:04:23,362
Are you sure you wanna do this?

1193
01:04:23,404 --> 01:04:24,950
I'm positive.

1194
01:04:24,992 --> 01:04:26,179
Okay, then.

1195
01:04:26,221 --> 01:04:27,822
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

1196
01:04:30,427 --> 01:04:32,233
Shall I go with you?

1197
01:04:32,275 --> 01:04:34,187
Nah, we got this.

1198
01:04:48,758 --> 01:04:50,759
- Mr. Bannon?
- Go away.

1199
01:04:51,635 --> 01:04:53,511
Mr. Bannon, my name is Amy Carpenter.

1200
01:04:53,553 --> 01:04:55,249
I wanna talk to you.

1201
01:04:55,291 --> 01:04:57,298
Go away or I'm calling the cops.

1202
01:04:57,340 --> 01:04:58,782
It's about clowns.

1203
01:05:00,816 --> 01:05:01,606
Come on, Amy.

1204
01:05:01,648 --> 01:05:02,802
Let's just go.

1205
01:05:02,844 --> 01:05:03,904
What about clowns?

1206
01:05:03,946 --> 01:05:05,779
I've seen 'em twice now

1207
01:05:05,821 --> 01:05:08,383
and I believe they're
killing people in this town

1208
01:05:08,425 --> 01:05:09,950
but nobody believes me.

1209
01:05:13,493 --> 01:05:15,564
Come on in but I haven't got much time.

1210
01:05:18,104 --> 01:05:20,769
[dramatic tone]

1211
01:05:23,104 --> 01:05:25,209
We have helped you, Marcus.

1212
01:05:25,251 --> 01:05:28,656
We have punished those
who have wronged you.

1213
01:05:28,698 --> 01:05:31,199
And now you must help us.

1214
01:05:31,241 --> 01:05:34,330
[giggling] How?

1215
01:05:34,372 --> 01:05:35,608
[Mr. Punch] The book.

1216
01:05:35,650 --> 01:05:37,452
We need our book back.

1217
01:05:38,407 --> 01:05:39,734
[giggling] I don't know where it is.

1218
01:05:39,776 --> 01:05:41,775
Someone must've taken it.

1219
01:05:41,817 --> 01:05:45,010
What did the man in the red hat say?

1220
01:05:45,052 --> 01:05:47,587
Maybe your brother has it.

1221
01:05:47,629 --> 01:05:49,155
My brother.

1222
01:05:49,197 --> 01:05:51,368
No, don't hurt my brother.

1223
01:05:52,254 --> 01:05:54,629
What about the woman next door?

1224
01:05:54,671 --> 01:05:56,917
Maybe she has it.

1225
01:05:56,959 --> 01:05:57,886
Amy?

1226
01:05:57,928 --> 01:06:00,993
No [giggling], she's my friend.

1227
01:06:01,035 --> 01:06:02,271
She saw us.

1228
01:06:02,313 --> 01:06:03,830
She saw you.

1229
01:06:03,872 --> 01:06:06,926
She will try to stop us.

1230
01:06:06,968 --> 01:06:11,359
She will ruin everything
if we don't get that book.

1231
01:06:11,401 --> 01:06:14,699
No, please leave her alone.

1232
01:06:14,741 --> 01:06:16,567
Who do we go after next, Marcus?

1233
01:06:16,609 --> 01:06:18,858
Your family or your friends?

1234
01:06:18,900 --> 01:06:20,297
Choose.

1235
01:06:20,339 --> 01:06:23,169
[Marcus groaning]

1236
01:06:26,249 --> 01:06:28,210
You can look but don't touch.

1237
01:06:29,186 --> 01:06:30,922
Now what is it you wanna
know about the clowns?

1238
01:06:30,964 --> 01:06:32,501
You're wasting my time.

1239
01:06:32,543 --> 01:06:34,100
A few days ago, I was driving

1240
01:06:34,142 --> 01:06:36,237
and I saw a clown wave to me

1241
01:06:36,279 --> 01:06:38,795
and he went into a little
tent and disappeared.

1242
01:06:38,837 --> 01:06:40,563
It was right in front of a house

1243
01:06:40,605 --> 01:06:42,541
where a couple of people had been murdered

1244
01:06:42,583 --> 01:06:43,939
on that same night.

1245
01:06:43,981 --> 01:06:46,307
Then I took my brother
to the movie theater

1246
01:06:46,349 --> 01:06:48,045
and I saw another clown.

1247
01:06:48,087 --> 01:06:50,232
But when I went to go
see what was going on,

1248
01:06:50,274 --> 01:06:51,906
I saw my friend Marcus.

1249
01:06:52,752 --> 01:06:54,718
My friend, Marcus, has
been dead for over a week.

1250
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:56,517
I went to his funeral.

1251
01:06:56,559 --> 01:06:59,474
I saw him at the movie
theater dressed as a clown.

1252
01:06:59,516 --> 01:07:01,811
But nobody else has seen him except for me

1253
01:07:01,853 --> 01:07:03,779
and nobody believes me.

1254
01:07:03,821 --> 01:07:06,821
Was your friend Marcus disabled?

1255
01:07:08,007 --> 01:07:10,612
Yes, how did you know that?

1256
01:07:10,654 --> 01:07:11,751
You should sit down.

1257
01:07:11,793 --> 01:07:13,614
This could take awhile.

1258
01:07:19,253 --> 01:07:22,470
[spooky circus music]

1259
01:07:22,512 --> 01:07:25,497
Many years ago, when in was
seven or eight years old,

1260
01:07:25,539 --> 01:07:28,544
I had an uncle who was a circus clown.

1261
01:07:28,586 --> 01:07:30,891
Small circus here in Donville

1262
01:07:30,933 --> 01:07:34,108
and they would entertain
the folks around here

1263
01:07:34,150 --> 01:07:35,247
and entertain the children,

1264
01:07:35,289 --> 01:07:38,114
especially those in the institutions

1265
01:07:38,156 --> 01:07:39,832
up and around here.

1266
01:07:39,874 --> 01:07:42,337
However, one day,

1267
01:07:42,379 --> 01:07:47,195
they found that my uncle was gay.

1268
01:07:47,237 --> 01:07:48,734
Not a great thing to be back then.

1269
01:07:48,776 --> 01:07:50,127
No, it wasn't.

1270
01:07:51,593 --> 01:07:54,378
And pretty soon, rumors and lies started

1271
01:07:54,420 --> 01:07:58,403
all around here that
my uncle and the clowns

1272
01:07:58,445 --> 01:08:03,128
were not only gay but pedophiles too.

1273
01:08:03,170 --> 01:08:05,446
That's always the assumption, isn't it.

1274
01:08:05,488 --> 01:08:07,780
Eventually, the police got involved

1275
01:08:07,822 --> 01:08:10,811
and I was told that they
were taken down state,

1276
01:08:10,853 --> 01:08:13,019
tried and convicted.

1277
01:08:13,061 --> 01:08:15,346
That was the last I heard of them.

1278
01:08:15,388 --> 01:08:17,409
Years later, when I was in my mid-20s,

1279
01:08:18,895 --> 01:08:20,851
I found one of the officers

1280
01:08:20,893 --> 01:08:24,082
who was involved in my
uncle being arrested.

1281
01:08:26,537 --> 01:08:31,025
I asked him, what happened to the clowns?

1282
01:08:31,931 --> 01:08:35,926
What happened to my uncle?

1283
01:08:35,968 --> 01:08:39,697
He told me, there was no trial.

1284
01:08:40,842 --> 01:08:43,438
They were taken into the woods,

1285
01:08:43,480 --> 01:08:47,383
they were beaten and killed,
and buried in a mass grave.

1286
01:08:47,425 --> 01:08:48,832
Oh, my God.

1287
01:08:49,873 --> 01:08:52,713
And the former officer
who told me this story,

1288
01:08:53,879 --> 01:08:58,468
he died a very mysterious,
grisly death the next day.

1289
01:08:59,524 --> 01:09:01,649
What about the other officers?

1290
01:09:01,691 --> 01:09:04,986
When I met with him, he
was the last one alive.

1291
01:09:05,028 --> 01:09:10,023
They also had died
mysterious, gruesome deaths.

1292
01:09:10,692 --> 01:09:15,025
Revenge from beyond, if you ask me.

1293
01:09:15,067 --> 01:09:17,917
Mr. Bannon, what can you
tell us about this book?

1294
01:09:29,323 --> 01:09:30,155
Mr. Bannon?

1295
01:09:32,769 --> 01:09:33,602
I'm sorry.

1296
01:09:36,645 --> 01:09:39,056
My Uncle Rosco made this book.

1297
01:09:41,560 --> 01:09:45,205
He took pictures of all
the places he had visited,

1298
01:09:45,247 --> 01:09:46,734
all the children he had helped.

1299
01:09:46,776 --> 01:09:49,810
He wanted this book to promote charity

1300
01:09:49,852 --> 01:09:53,466
for all those with
disabilities who were stuck,

1301
01:09:53,508 --> 01:09:55,914
stuck in institutions.

1302
01:09:55,956 --> 01:09:59,076
This book was an embodiment
of his compassion.

1303
01:10:00,744 --> 01:10:03,408
[dramatic tone]

1304
01:10:04,257 --> 01:10:07,731
It became something dark and a focus

1305
01:10:07,773 --> 01:10:11,608
of their power of destruction and a lure

1306
01:10:11,650 --> 01:10:15,120
for whoever shares their
desire for revenge.

1307
01:10:17,524 --> 01:10:18,766
Where did you get this?

1308
01:10:19,822 --> 01:10:22,387
My brother had it on him when he died.

1309
01:10:22,429 --> 01:10:23,501
Was he different?

1310
01:10:24,417 --> 01:10:26,393
Well, yes, he had a disability.

1311
01:10:26,435 --> 01:10:28,420
That's why the clowns chose him.

1312
01:10:29,262 --> 01:10:33,017
They've already made him
into one of their own.

1313
01:10:33,059 --> 01:10:36,008
Mr. Bannon, I am so
sorry about your uncle.

1314
01:10:36,925 --> 01:10:38,890
No amount of sorrow will bring

1315
01:10:38,932 --> 01:10:41,937
back my uncle or his friends.

1316
01:10:41,979 --> 01:10:44,025
They not only lost their lives,

1317
01:10:44,067 --> 01:10:46,063
they lost their souls.

1318
01:10:46,105 --> 01:10:49,489
This town is haunted by their ghosts.

1319
01:10:49,531 --> 01:10:52,999
No one believes me or ever will.

1320
01:10:53,041 --> 01:10:54,184
Now get out!

1321
01:10:54,226 --> 01:10:55,383
I believe you.

1322
01:10:55,425 --> 01:10:57,627
Goddammit, get out!

1323
01:10:58,996 --> 01:10:59,892
[Amy] I told you.

1324
01:10:59,934 --> 01:11:00,807
I told you.

1325
01:11:02,908 --> 01:11:04,277
Now you believe me?

1326
01:11:08,070 --> 01:11:09,939
[Newcaster] And in more depressing news,

1327
01:11:09,981 --> 01:11:13,545
after 158 years, the
Williamson Gazette has decided

1328
01:11:13,587 --> 01:11:14,738
to close its doors.

1329
01:11:15,664 --> 01:11:17,151
To the dying art of journalism.

1330
01:11:17,193 --> 01:11:19,488
[Newcaster] Along with
plummeting ad revenue,

1331
01:11:19,530 --> 01:11:21,827
have made the standard
printed newspaper a thing

1332
01:11:21,869 --> 01:11:22,771
of the past.

1333
01:11:23,637 --> 01:11:27,061
78 full-time employees
will be searching for jobs

1334
01:11:27,103 --> 01:11:29,189
in an industry that has transformed

1335
01:11:29,231 --> 01:11:32,146
into something old news people like myself

1336
01:11:32,188 --> 01:11:33,919
do not recognize any more.

1337
01:11:35,095 --> 01:11:36,407
What are your thoughts?

1338
01:11:36,449 --> 01:11:41,444
[electricity buzzing]
[radio playing]

1339
01:11:46,940 --> 01:11:50,287
[ball spinning]

1340
01:11:50,329 --> 01:11:52,422
Hello?

1341
01:11:52,464 --> 01:11:55,211
[glass breaking]

1342
01:12:00,089 --> 01:12:02,570
Yes, I think there's
an intruder in my home.

1343
01:12:05,745 --> 01:12:07,375
Yes, I can stay on the line.

1344
01:12:08,801 --> 01:12:10,437
Please send someone quick.

1345
01:12:13,099 --> 01:12:15,929
[weapon slashing]

1346
01:12:24,427 --> 01:12:27,091
[beating couch]

1347
01:12:33,545 --> 01:12:36,125
[hitting ball]

1348
01:12:38,152 --> 01:12:41,066
[doorbell ringing]

1349
01:12:42,424 --> 01:12:43,523
Oh, officers, thank God.

1350
01:12:43,565 --> 01:12:45,641
There's something in my home.

1351
01:12:45,683 --> 01:12:46,647
Relax, miss.

1352
01:12:46,689 --> 01:12:48,079
You don't have anything to worry about.

1353
01:12:48,121 --> 01:12:50,482
We're gonna take a little drive, miss.

1354
01:12:50,524 --> 01:12:51,314
What?

1355
01:12:51,356 --> 01:12:52,874
Drive to where?

1356
01:12:52,916 --> 01:12:53,932
To the woods.

1357
01:12:53,974 --> 01:12:56,471
You've been nosing around
in police business,

1358
01:12:56,513 --> 01:12:57,412
haven't you, miss?

1359
01:12:59,923 --> 01:13:01,321
[woman screaming]

1360
01:13:01,363 --> 01:13:04,043
[Commentator] Now
Andy Williams coming in.

1361
01:13:04,085 --> 01:13:06,121
Butcher, gonna lift up none of it high.

1362
01:13:06,163 --> 01:13:07,721
- Power bomb.
- Slams him down.

1363
01:13:09,312 --> 01:13:11,869
That could be all that she wrote.

1364
01:13:14,963 --> 01:13:17,810
Surprised Andy's not
going for the cover here.

1365
01:13:17,852 --> 01:13:19,787
[TV clicking]

1366
01:13:19,829 --> 01:13:21,231
Ah, shit.

1367
01:13:27,828 --> 01:13:32,822
[horn honking]
[spooky circus music]

1368
01:13:34,693 --> 01:13:35,525
Hello?

1369
01:13:39,798 --> 01:13:40,690
Who's there?

1370
01:13:59,870 --> 01:14:04,864
[spooky laughing]
[horror music]

1371
01:14:13,125 --> 01:14:15,250
You know, Amy, we should've asked him

1372
01:14:15,292 --> 01:14:16,819
what to do now.

1373
01:14:16,861 --> 01:14:17,651
I don't think so.

1374
01:14:17,693 --> 01:14:19,426
He obviously didn't want us there at all.

1375
01:14:19,468 --> 01:14:21,234
Okay, but he sat us down,

1376
01:14:21,276 --> 01:14:23,001
told us the whole story.

1377
01:14:23,043 --> 01:14:25,439
Maybe there's something
he knows that can help us.

1378
01:14:25,481 --> 01:14:26,688
Help us do what?

1379
01:14:26,730 --> 01:14:27,672
Fight ghosts.

1380
01:14:28,768 --> 01:14:31,503
Amy, why are you
taking this so seriously?

1381
01:14:31,545 --> 01:14:33,172
Because, one of them saw me.

1382
01:14:33,214 --> 01:14:35,230
They know I'm on to them.

1383
01:14:35,272 --> 01:14:36,918
I could be next.

1384
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:38,307
These clowns are going after people

1385
01:14:38,349 --> 01:14:40,265
that hurt Marcus.

1386
01:14:40,307 --> 01:14:41,256
You never did that.

1387
01:14:42,934 --> 01:14:45,160
That's right and you're his brother.

1388
01:14:45,202 --> 01:14:48,288
So we're the ones that have
nothing to worry about, right?

1389
01:14:48,330 --> 01:14:49,355
I guess you're right.

1390
01:14:49,397 --> 01:14:51,323
Hey, you wanna come in for awhile?

1391
01:14:51,365 --> 01:14:53,001
We can go see Dan.

1392
01:14:53,043 --> 01:14:54,090
He'll put us in a better mood

1393
01:14:54,132 --> 01:14:55,639
after that history lesson.

1394
01:14:55,681 --> 01:14:56,783
- Yeah, sure.
- Okay.

1395
01:15:05,673 --> 01:15:08,337
[door knocking]

1396
01:15:11,094 --> 01:15:12,176
That's weird.

1397
01:15:13,393 --> 01:15:16,313
- Dan?
- Maybe he fell asleep.

1398
01:15:17,299 --> 01:15:20,379
At this time, I highly doubt it.

1399
01:15:21,772 --> 01:15:25,099
[door knocking]

1400
01:15:25,141 --> 01:15:27,623
Something's weird.
[banging door]

1401
01:15:27,665 --> 01:15:28,884
- Dan!
- I'm sure he's probably

1402
01:15:28,926 --> 01:15:29,734
in the bathroom or something.

1403
01:15:29,776 --> 01:15:30,683
This isn't funny.

1404
01:15:30,725 --> 01:15:31,857
Open the door.

1405
01:15:37,089 --> 01:15:37,921
Dan?

1406
01:15:39,659 --> 01:15:41,240
Where are you, Dan?

1407
01:15:46,266 --> 01:15:47,871
[spooky circus music]

1408
01:15:47,913 --> 01:15:49,849
- Dan?
- Amy.

1409
01:15:53,013 --> 01:15:54,000
Oh, my God.

1410
01:15:54,042 --> 01:15:56,297
We have to give the
clowns their book back.

1411
01:15:56,339 --> 01:15:57,206
If your brother's been abducted,

1412
01:15:57,248 --> 01:15:58,615
we need to go to the police.

1413
01:15:58,657 --> 01:15:59,447
The police.

1414
01:15:59,489 --> 01:16:00,813
James, the police in
this town are the ones

1415
01:16:00,855 --> 01:16:01,645
who started this.

1416
01:16:01,687 --> 01:16:03,490
I don't really trust them either

1417
01:16:03,532 --> 01:16:04,409
but if your brother's been abducted,

1418
01:16:04,451 --> 01:16:05,617
we have to go to the police.

1419
01:16:05,659 --> 01:16:06,490
And tell them what?

1420
01:16:06,532 --> 01:16:09,035
That my brother was abducted by ghosts.

1421
01:16:09,077 --> 01:16:09,974
We don't have time.

1422
01:16:10,016 --> 01:16:12,511
We have to give the clowns their book back

1423
01:16:12,553 --> 01:16:13,745
before it's too late.

1424
01:16:14,651 --> 01:16:16,899
Amy, isn't there anyone
that you can trust?

1425
01:16:18,134 --> 01:16:18,966
Kelly.

1426
01:16:20,590 --> 01:16:23,504
[ringtone playing]

1427
01:16:26,968 --> 01:16:28,075
Hello?

1428
01:16:28,117 --> 01:16:28,907
Kelly, it's me.

1429
01:16:28,949 --> 01:16:31,952
Listen, I don't know what to do.

1430
01:16:31,994 --> 01:16:33,330
Dan's been kidnapped.

1431
01:16:33,372 --> 01:16:35,418
I have to go to Legacy Park.

1432
01:16:35,460 --> 01:16:37,476
I don't even know if he's dead or alive

1433
01:16:37,518 --> 01:16:38,308
or what they're gonna do to me.

1434
01:16:38,350 --> 01:16:39,643
[Kelly] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1435
01:16:39,685 --> 01:16:41,167
Slow down, slow down.

1436
01:16:41,209 --> 01:16:43,078
I'm so scared.

1437
01:16:43,120 --> 01:16:45,262
- [spooky music]
- What's going on?

1438
01:16:45,304 --> 01:16:46,095
I don't know what to do.

1439
01:16:46,137 --> 01:16:48,010
I'm so sorry that I involved you.

1440
01:16:48,052 --> 01:16:50,372
- [Kelly squelching]
- Hello?

1441
01:16:50,414 --> 01:16:52,090
Oh, you should be.

1442
01:16:52,132 --> 01:16:52,964
Who's this?

1443
01:16:53,945 --> 01:16:56,097
Oh, I'm the clown that just killed

1444
01:16:56,139 --> 01:16:58,095
your little girlfriend.

1445
01:16:58,137 --> 01:17:00,987
Bring our book to the park

1446
01:17:01,029 --> 01:17:02,577
or your little brother gets it.

1447
01:17:03,412 --> 01:17:04,494
Bring it now.

1448
01:17:05,446 --> 01:17:06,236
Fuck you.
[clown laughing]

1449
01:17:06,278 --> 01:17:08,709
Fuck you, you fucking monster.

1450
01:17:12,422 --> 01:17:13,369
We gotta go.

1451
01:17:13,411 --> 01:17:14,717
The book's in the car, we gotta go.

1452
01:17:14,759 --> 01:17:15,716
Wait, what?

1453
01:17:15,758 --> 01:17:16,980
We have to go!

1454
01:17:20,684 --> 01:17:21,796
Where am I?

1455
01:17:23,111 --> 01:17:25,512
Where no one can hurt you anymore.

1456
01:17:26,488 --> 01:17:27,969
Who are you people?

1457
01:17:29,115 --> 01:17:30,252
These are my friends.

1458
01:17:30,294 --> 01:17:31,990
I'm your friend, Marcus.

1459
01:17:32,032 --> 01:17:33,768
Why have I been taken here?

1460
01:17:33,810 --> 01:17:36,575
It's complicated.

1461
01:17:36,617 --> 01:17:39,102
But they explained it to me [giggling].

1462
01:17:39,144 --> 01:17:41,690
We protect those who have been wronged.

1463
01:17:41,732 --> 01:17:44,810
And we want to do the same for you, Dan.

1464
01:17:44,852 --> 01:17:45,966
What do you mean?

1465
01:17:46,008 --> 01:17:48,124
Aren't you tired of it, Dan?

1466
01:17:48,166 --> 01:17:50,195
All the cruelty.

1467
01:17:50,237 --> 01:17:51,680
All the bigotry.

1468
01:17:51,722 --> 01:17:54,714
- I am.
- Then join us.

1469
01:17:54,756 --> 01:17:55,836
What?

1470
01:17:55,878 --> 01:17:58,246
We hurt people who hurt us.

1471
01:17:58,288 --> 01:18:00,271
The people who killed Marcus,

1472
01:18:00,313 --> 01:18:02,059
we killed them back.

1473
01:18:02,101 --> 01:18:03,638
Join us, Dan.

1474
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:07,784
Help us write the next
chapter in our book.

1475
01:18:07,826 --> 01:18:08,658
No.

1476
01:18:09,980 --> 01:18:11,900
I don't wanna hurt anyone.

1477
01:18:11,942 --> 01:18:15,205
[electricity zapping]
[Dan yelping]

1478
01:18:17,486 --> 01:18:19,881
The book will be here soon.

1479
01:18:19,923 --> 01:18:22,568
I hope you change your mind by then

1480
01:18:22,610 --> 01:18:25,590
or you'll be the page that we rip out.

1481
01:18:33,979 --> 01:18:35,066
Now what?

1482
01:18:35,108 --> 01:18:37,279
Amy, we don't know who's in there.

1483
01:18:38,495 --> 01:18:39,891
What if they're armed?

1484
01:18:39,933 --> 01:18:40,723
We know who's in there.

1485
01:18:40,765 --> 01:18:43,777
It's the fucking clowns
that Peter told us about.

1486
01:18:43,819 --> 01:18:45,235
Fucking clowns.

1487
01:18:45,277 --> 01:18:48,142
Amy, Peter's a crazy old man.

1488
01:18:48,184 --> 01:18:51,359
I doubt it is undead clowns
that have your brother in there.

1489
01:18:51,401 --> 01:18:52,847
But what if it is?

1490
01:18:52,889 --> 01:18:54,915
If the book is so important to them,

1491
01:18:54,957 --> 01:18:56,465
maybe we have leverage.

1492
01:18:56,507 --> 01:18:59,391
James, please, my
brother's life's at stake.

1493
01:18:59,433 --> 01:19:00,350
Let's go do this.

1494
01:19:00,392 --> 01:19:02,488
I would do this for you
if Marcus was in there.

1495
01:19:02,530 --> 01:19:03,362
Come on.

1496
01:19:04,870 --> 01:19:05,769
Fuck, all right.

1497
01:19:22,451 --> 01:19:25,533
[suspenseful music]

1498
01:19:25,575 --> 01:19:27,073
That's the tent.

1499
01:19:28,943 --> 01:19:30,015
We have to go in.

1500
01:19:31,066 --> 01:19:31,898
Come on.

1501
01:19:37,253 --> 01:19:40,200
[thunder cracking]

1502
01:19:40,242 --> 01:19:41,226
Amy!

1503
01:19:41,268 --> 01:19:43,282
[cage rattling]

1504
01:19:43,324 --> 01:19:44,749
Dan!

1505
01:19:46,014 --> 01:19:47,992
[spooky circus music]

1506
01:19:48,034 --> 01:19:51,189
Release my brother now, you motherfuckers.

1507
01:19:51,231 --> 01:19:52,417
Marcus?

1508
01:19:52,459 --> 01:19:54,985
Marcus, as you knew
him, no longer exists.

1509
01:19:55,027 --> 01:19:56,773
He's one of us now.

1510
01:19:56,815 --> 01:19:58,521
Release my brother now.

1511
01:19:58,563 --> 01:20:00,778
Ah, ah, ah, not so fast.

1512
01:20:00,820 --> 01:20:05,444
Give us the book first,
then Danny Boy walks free.

1513
01:20:05,486 --> 01:20:07,617
It's the source of our power!

1514
01:20:08,933 --> 01:20:10,170
[Clown Puppet] Shut it, fatty.

1515
01:20:10,212 --> 01:20:12,387
It's none of their business.

1516
01:20:12,429 --> 01:20:13,828
I could destroy this book.

1517
01:20:15,054 --> 01:20:17,015
[electricity zapping]
[Dan groaning]

1518
01:20:17,057 --> 01:20:18,689
No, Dan!

1519
01:20:19,941 --> 01:20:24,936
And we can destroy him,
so what's it gonna be?

1520
01:20:25,049 --> 01:20:27,088
[spooky circus music]

1521
01:20:28,537 --> 01:20:29,369
Amy, wait!

1522
01:20:32,253 --> 01:20:35,083
[spooky laughing]

1523
01:20:38,413 --> 01:20:41,154
Now you have your fucking
book, let my brother go.

1524
01:20:41,196 --> 01:20:46,190
Um, no.
[spooky laughing]

1525
01:20:47,726 --> 01:20:48,907
Let him go!

1526
01:20:48,949 --> 01:20:50,323
We had a deal!

1527
01:20:51,509 --> 01:20:54,124
Sorry, bitch, but we decided

1528
01:20:54,166 --> 01:20:56,343
to make him one of us.

1529
01:20:56,385 --> 01:20:57,427
You motherfuckers.

1530
01:21:00,926 --> 01:21:03,175
- [weapon slashing]
- James.

1531
01:21:03,217 --> 01:21:05,808
Float like a balloon, sting like a bee.

1532
01:21:11,348 --> 01:21:14,012
[feet stomping]

1533
01:21:15,231 --> 01:21:19,309
James [grunting and coughing].

1534
01:21:22,004 --> 01:21:24,668
[cage rattling]

1535
01:21:28,706 --> 01:21:33,701

[Amy screaming]

1536
01:21:35,227 --> 01:21:36,395
Oh, Dan.

[weapon slashing]
[clown gasping]

1540
01:21:57,475 --> 01:22:00,082
Drop the weapon, Dan,
or we kill your friends.

1541
01:22:03,620 --> 01:22:05,991
[feet stomping]

1542
01:22:06,033 --> 01:22:08,020
Wait, Marcus.

1543
01:22:08,062 --> 01:22:10,477
I have something to say to everyone.

1544
01:22:10,519 --> 01:22:12,895
Hold on, my brother clowns [giggling].

1545
01:22:12,937 --> 01:22:16,366
Dan here has something he needs to say.

1546
01:22:16,408 --> 01:22:19,072
[feet stomping]

1547
01:22:24,235 --> 01:22:27,314
Well, we're waiting.

1548
01:22:28,350 --> 01:22:30,826
You're my friend, Marcus.

1549
01:22:30,868 --> 01:22:35,252
I don't want you to hurt
my sister and James.

1550
01:22:35,294 --> 01:22:36,890
It's already too late.

1551
01:22:36,932 --> 01:22:39,098
The clowns are my family now.

1552
01:22:39,140 --> 01:22:43,523
I am your family and
so is Amy and James.

1553
01:22:43,565 --> 01:22:46,527
I'm sorry you were treated like
shit by Liz and the others.

1554
01:22:46,569 --> 01:22:49,057
[Mr. Punch] Don't listen to him, Marcus.

1555
01:22:49,099 --> 01:22:53,747
We're your real family,
as he soon will be.

1556
01:22:56,468 --> 01:23:00,235
[Dan stomping]
[puppet yelling]

1557
01:23:00,277 --> 01:23:02,105
I know the clowns took
you in as their family

1558
01:23:02,147 --> 01:23:06,150
when you died, but I can
offer you something better.

1559
01:23:06,192 --> 01:23:07,928
Which is what?

1560
01:23:07,970 --> 01:23:10,621
Trust, loyalty,

1561
01:23:12,136 --> 01:23:15,725
compassion, and love.

1562
01:23:17,890 --> 01:23:22,799
You're my friend, Marcus,
and also my brother,

1563
01:23:24,554 --> 01:23:27,409
forever and ever.

- Dan.

1570
01:24:45,605 --> 01:24:46,437
Goodbye.

1571
01:24:48,576 --> 01:24:53,571
You can rest now.

1573
01:25:13,264 --> 01:25:14,346
Hey, James.

1574
01:25:15,683 --> 01:25:17,216
How are you holding up?

1575
01:25:17,258 --> 01:25:18,215
Okay.

1576
01:25:18,257 --> 01:25:19,195
The doctor said I should be able

1577
01:25:19,237 --> 01:25:21,414
to do things normally pretty soon.

1578
01:25:21,456 --> 01:25:23,231
Oh, that's good to hear.

1579
01:25:23,273 --> 01:25:24,330
How are you?

1580
01:25:24,372 --> 01:25:27,019
Is your mom still upset
about what happened with Dan?

1581
01:25:28,108 --> 01:25:30,983
Yeah, pretty much.

1582
01:25:31,025 --> 01:25:32,461
You did tell her that he was kidnapped

1583
01:25:32,503 --> 01:25:36,147
and murdered by a bunch of guys
in the woods though, right?

1584
01:25:36,189 --> 01:25:38,815
Yeah, and she said
that I should've never

1585
01:25:38,857 --> 01:25:41,791
left Dan alone by himself to begin with,

1586
01:25:41,833 --> 01:25:45,548
even though she did the
same with him all the time.

1587
01:25:45,590 --> 01:25:46,689
Sorry, to hear that.

1588
01:25:47,588 --> 01:25:49,639
You think the police
will believe your story?

1589
01:25:50,895 --> 01:25:52,351
Well, Liz and her friends were killed

1590
01:25:52,393 --> 01:25:54,809
in mysterious circumstances.

1591
01:25:54,851 --> 01:25:57,248
What happened to Dan is
being treated like that.

1592
01:25:58,350 --> 01:26:00,503
So now we've each lost a brother.

1593
01:26:00,545 --> 01:26:02,970
Yeah, I guess so.

1594
01:26:03,012 --> 01:26:05,887
Another story for this town to bury.

1595
01:26:05,929 --> 01:26:08,525
Anyway, I just wanted
to check in and say hi.

1596
01:26:08,567 --> 01:26:10,084
I'll talk to you later, all right?

1597
01:26:10,126 --> 01:26:12,751
Okay, I'll talk to you later.

1598
01:26:12,793 --> 01:26:14,014
And James?

1599
01:26:14,940 --> 01:26:17,176
Thank you for all your help.

1600
01:26:17,218 --> 01:26:18,175
Don't mention it.

1601
01:26:18,217 --> 01:26:19,049

This is impossible, I saw you all die.

Well, bitch, you just
can't keep a good clown down.

1607
01:26:51,808 --> 01:26:52,598
But I burned the book

1608
01:26:52,640 --> 01:26:54,976
