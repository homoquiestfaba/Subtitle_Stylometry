I had a gentle husband
who I loved, who loved me.

00:00:34,801 --> 00:00:38,001
We had a baby, our own home,

10
00:00:41,474 --> 00:00:45,714
And then one day, all
of that was shattered.

11
00:00:45,812 --> 00:00:50,052

everything I believed.

What did you do?

22
00:01:39,966 --> 00:01:42,336
I think I killed someone.

23
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:43,605
Get some bandages.

00:01:43,703 --> 00:01:45,303

What do we got?

36
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:29,382
The husband, Roth Lane,
he's in pretty bad shape--

37
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:30,452
multiple stab wounds.

38
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:32,490
Looks like he was strangled too.

39
00:02:32,585 --> 00:02:33,415
The wife?

40
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,550
Anne Lane.

41
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:35,854
She was dead when we got here.

Oh, yeah.

57
00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:34,145
The guy said he came to the
station right from here.

58
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:35,917
Well, did he
say why he did it?

What can I tell you?

60
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:38,223

we know where she lives?

I guess.

68
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,130
He gave us his address
at the station.

69
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,068
Well, get a radio car
over there right now.

70
00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:54,333

kill his own family too.

I just woke up.

92
00:04:38,678 --> 00:04:40,878
Maybe he went to work early.

get dressed and come with us,

I'm sorry, but your
mother has been killed.

We have to go to the hospital.

107
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:09,311
Can you watch Kimberly?

108
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:10,379
Yeah, sure.

What's wrong?

110

112

No.

114
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,060
I'll check his car when I
get back to the station.

115
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:30,592
The husband say anything?

116
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:33,967
He was unconscious
when we got here.

117
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:36,107
So what do you think?

118
00:05:36,202 --> 00:05:38,142
Mother-in-law just let him in?

119
00:05:38,237 --> 00:05:39,707

had a house key.

Gave it back to
me at the station.

124
00:05:45,912 --> 00:05:50,312
So he comes in and
attacks them in their sleep.

Yeah.

129
00:06:02,228 --> 00:06:04,168
Probably came in here to get
the knife so the murder weapon

130
00:06:04,263 --> 00:06:05,633
wouldn't be traced to him.

131
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:07,162
And then took the
phone off the hook

132
00:06:07,266 --> 00:06:09,406
so no one could call for help.

133
00:06:09,502 --> 00:06:11,502
You know where the knife is?

134
00:06:11,604 --> 00:06:12,844
We found it in his car.

00:06:15,441 --> 00:06:18,011

does something cagey,

136
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:22,311

Oh, over here, the

POLICEMAN: No.

146
00:06:42,001 --> 00:06:46,101
So why'd he park
at the neighbor's?

147
00:06:46,205 --> 00:06:49,205

00:08:58,104 --> 00:08:59,604
Said she thought he
might be at work.

188
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:00,575
You didn't tell her?

189
00:09:04,343 --> 00:09:06,913
[woman speaking on pa]

190
00:09:08,347 --> 00:09:10,387
Why does a guy
attack his in-laws

191
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:12,153
and then turn himself in?

192
00:09:12,251 --> 00:09:14,451
He gets cut during the attack.

193
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:15,624
Afraid he's going to look bad.

194
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:17,661
So instead of waiting
to be accused,

195
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:20,297
he comes right to us,
claiming he can't remember.

196
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:23,133
Yeah, temporary insanity.

197
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,269
So why does he go
after both of them?

198
00:09:25,364 --> 00:09:28,764
Insurance, inheritance.

199
00:09:28,868 --> 00:09:31,038
Huh.

200
00:09:31,137 --> 00:09:32,777
See if you can get the
family lawyer on the phone.

201
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:43,849
When he gets in, can you
have him call his wife?

202
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:44,750
No, no, wait.

203
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:45,920
I'm not sure where I'll be.

204
00:09:46,018 --> 00:09:47,388
I'll call back.

Why don't we sit down?

208
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:59,070
We want to see our father.

They're stabilizing him.

210
00:10:01,467 --> 00:10:02,707
Let me ask you a
few questions first,

211
00:10:02,802 --> 00:10:05,972
and then I'll see if
I can get you in, OK?

212
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:10,442
So just tell me what happened.

[suspenseful music]

214
00:10:15,514 --> 00:10:22,924
We were sleeping, and Tanya
heard our mother screaming.

215
00:10:23,022 --> 00:10:26,392
At first, I
thought it was just

216
00:10:26,492 --> 00:10:32,532
somebody watching the
television, you know,

217
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:35,832

saw who it was?

They're fine.

to kid you, Mark.

you of your rights?

That's good.

It's better if we can
work this out ourselves.

277
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:38,686
So why don't you just
tell us what happened?

278
00:13:41,754 --> 00:13:45,854
All I know is I was falling
asleep on my couch at home,

279
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:51,298
and the next thing I
know, I was at my in-laws.

280
00:13:51,397 --> 00:13:52,497
I mean, I think I--

281
00:13:52,598 --> 00:13:55,168
I know that I--

282
00:13:55,267 --> 00:13:57,307
I can see Anne's face.

283
00:13:57,403 --> 00:14:02,513
And I had this feeling that
her kids were in danger.

284
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:05,308
So I went running upstairs.

285
00:14:08,147 --> 00:14:09,247
That's it.

286
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:11,148
I mean, the next thing I
know, I was driving my car

287
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:14,890
and had this knife
in my hand, so I--

288
00:14:14,987 --> 00:14:16,387
that's when I drove
to the police station.

289
00:14:22,995 --> 00:14:26,635
Mark, we're trying
to help you here.

290
00:14:26,732 --> 00:14:27,872
And what are you doing?

291
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:29,137
You're lying to us.

292
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:30,035
No, I'm not.

293
00:14:30,135 --> 00:14:31,435
I swear.

294
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:34,077
Mark, you drove, what, 15, 20
miles to your in-law's house,

295
00:14:34,173 --> 00:14:36,143
took a tire iron into
the house, and beat

296
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:37,242
your mother-in-law to death?

297
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:38,473
Tire iron?

298
00:14:38,577 --> 00:14:40,377
And you attacked your
father-in-law with a knife.

299
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:42,149
You expect us to believe
that you don't remember?

300
00:14:42,248 --> 00:14:43,848
I know it doesn't
make any sense,

301
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:46,619
but that is what happened.

302
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:47,519
All right, Mark.

303
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:48,420
Mark, listen.

304
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:51,220
Just stop lying to us.

Stop.

You think we're stupid?

307
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,501
You think you can just go kill
someone and then just say,

308
00:14:57,596 --> 00:15:00,496
I don't remember, and we'll
go, oh, oh, you don't remember?

309
00:15:00,599 --> 00:15:01,899
Oh, I see.
That's fine.

310
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:02,801
Go on home.

Have a nice day.

312
00:15:03,802 --> 00:15:04,642
I mean, come on Mark.

313
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:08,107
I loved Anne, all right?

314
00:15:08,207 --> 00:15:09,507
She was wonderful to me.

315
00:15:09,608 --> 00:15:14,178
I would never ever hurt
her, I swear to you.

316
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,480
Look, you went over there.

317
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:17,951
You got into an argument,
and things got out of hand.

318
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:18,850
I can understand that.

319
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:22,491
Mark, a jury can
understand that.

320
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:25,858
I want to know what happened.

321
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:27,188
I just can't remember.

322
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:34,729
I should have gone down there.

323
00:15:37,469 --> 00:15:38,969

Yeah.

327
00:15:43,742 --> 00:15:45,612
Well, you would have only
got yourself hurt too.

328
00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:48,111
They arrested someone.

00:15:48,213 --> 00:15:50,353

nurses talking.

detective tell us?

Let's go back.

No.

Your husband's under arrest
for the murder of your mother.

You've got to be
out of your mind.

341

He's confessed.

342
00:16:30,222 --> 00:16:31,492
What?

343
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:32,490
He's confessed.

What did the detectives say?

CHRISTOPHER: Lauren,
what did he say?

349
00:17:27,646 --> 00:17:28,546
It was Mark.

350
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:33,887
They've arrested Mark.

351
00:17:33,986 --> 00:17:34,816
Mark?

352
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,320
The police think
that Mark did it?

353
00:17:36,422 --> 00:17:37,222
TANYA: Why?

354
00:17:37,322 --> 00:17:38,122
Wait a minute.

355
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:39,063
Why would they think that?

356
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:40,828
They said he's confessed.

357
00:17:40,926 --> 00:17:42,666
He said that he did it?

358
00:17:42,761 --> 00:17:43,801
Why would he hurt Mom?

359
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,326
They got along great.

360
00:17:45,431 --> 00:17:46,331
I don't know.

361
00:17:49,868 --> 00:17:52,638
[sighs] I'm sorry that I
couldn't tell you before.

362
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:55,208
We had some things that
we had to check out.

363
00:17:55,307 --> 00:17:56,877
Are you sure that Mark did it?

364
00:17:56,975 --> 00:17:58,975
He was wounded in the attack.

365
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,008
He had blood all over.

366
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:09,854
Do you have any idea why
he attacked your parents?

367
00:18:09,955 --> 00:18:13,755
Had anything happened
between them?

368
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:16,399
Had they been arguing?

369
00:18:16,495 --> 00:18:18,435
I don't think they ever had
an argument about anything.

370
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:19,330
CHRISTOPHER: No.

371
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:22,631
No, my mom and dad liked Mark.

372
00:18:22,734 --> 00:18:24,974
What does he say?

373
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:28,270
He says he can't remember
what happened, nothing.

374
00:18:30,976 --> 00:18:33,846
So you had no suspicion that
anything was wrong between him

375
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:34,846
and your parents?

376
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:40,157
When was the last
time you saw him?

377
00:18:40,252 --> 00:18:42,322
Last night when I went to bed.

378
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:44,891
Did you hear him get up?

379
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:47,360
He slept on the couch.

380
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:48,799
Why the couch?

381
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:51,164
He was having
trouble sleeping,

382
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:54,463
so he stayed up and watched TV.

383
00:18:54,566 --> 00:18:55,836
Hmm.

384
00:18:55,934 --> 00:18:58,674
He has a key to
your parents' place?

385
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:01,470
I have a key to my parents'
place on my key ring.

386
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,680
These are his.

387
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:13,520
He must have taken mine.

388
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:16,019
All right.

389
00:19:16,121 --> 00:19:18,021
I'll need to get some formal
statements from you all later

390
00:19:18,123 --> 00:19:23,233
on, but right now I need someone
to identify your mother's body.

[soft music]

392
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:28,399
I'll do it.

00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:33,201
No, I'll do it.

EILEEN: When the police called
to tell me that my grandson had

401
00:20:36,668 --> 00:20:38,708
been charged with
killing Lauren's mother,

402
00:20:38,804 --> 00:20:41,444
I told them right out there
had to be some mistake.

403
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,940
Not Mark, it wasn't possible.

404
00:20:44,042 --> 00:20:45,412
I raised that boy.

405
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:47,610
And in many ways, he
was the most gentle

406
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:50,083
person in the whole family.

407
00:20:50,182 --> 00:20:52,922
I told the police
everything I know, Gram.

408
00:20:53,018 --> 00:20:55,258
They don't believe me.

409
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:57,024
I'm going to get you a lawyer.

410
00:20:57,122 --> 00:20:59,092
No, Gram.

411
00:20:59,191 --> 00:21:01,161
I don't want you spending
your money on a lawyer.

412
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,360
Oh, nonsense.

413
00:21:02,461 --> 00:21:06,301
What else have I got to
spend my money on, bingo?

414
00:21:06,398 --> 00:21:07,898

00:21:09,901 --> 00:21:10,901
[sighs] Gram.

416
00:21:13,905 --> 00:21:18,445
I keep thinking about how
this could have happened,

417
00:21:18,543 --> 00:21:21,643
and all I can
think is that maybe

418
00:21:21,747 --> 00:21:23,217
somebody's trying to frame me.

419
00:21:30,656 --> 00:21:31,726
I'm going to go now.

420
00:21:34,526 --> 00:21:35,496
May I hug him?

BROOKE: Where are his parents?

423
00:21:46,772 --> 00:21:49,612
Oh, well, he never
really knew his father.

424
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:52,348
And his mother
died 12 years ago.

425
00:21:52,444 --> 00:21:54,384
And that's when he
came to live with me.

426
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:56,079
And I can tell you this--

427
00:21:56,181 --> 00:21:58,321
that boy is no killer.

428
00:21:58,417 --> 00:22:00,417
He says he doesn't
remember anything?

429
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:02,919
Bits and pieces.

430
00:22:03,021 --> 00:22:06,561
He thinks maybe someone else did
it and is trying to frame him.

431
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:08,658
Frame him?

432
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,360
What makes him think that?

433
00:22:10,462 --> 00:22:11,662
Well, we couldn't really talk.

434
00:22:11,763 --> 00:22:15,163
There was a police
officer in the room.

435
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:17,667
You know private
defense can be expensive.

436
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:20,009
I have some stocks I can sell.

437
00:22:20,105 --> 00:22:24,175
And I can take out a mortgage
on my house if necessary.

438
00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:25,506
All right.

439
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:26,950
I'll talk with him tomorrow.

440
00:22:27,045 --> 00:22:29,585
I'll call you afterwards and
tell you if I'll take the case.

441
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:30,581
Thank you.

Hi.

445
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:04,685
I better feed her.

446
00:23:04,783 --> 00:23:05,713
I think she's all right.

447
00:23:05,817 --> 00:23:07,817
I gave her a bottle
about an hour ago.

Hi, Eileen.

456
00:23:30,976 --> 00:23:34,216
It's-- no, it's
Christopher, her brother.

457
00:23:34,312 --> 00:23:35,812
It's Mark's grandmother.

458
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:39,753
She can't come to
the phone right now.

459
00:23:39,851 --> 00:23:42,091
Can I have her call you back?

460
00:23:42,187 --> 00:23:43,587
Yeah, I will.

Lauren, was Mark
different with you at all?

00:23:52,631 --> 00:23:54,201
I mean, did he hit
you or anything?

467
00:23:54,299 --> 00:23:55,839
No.

Did you guys have
a fight last night?

00:23:57,369 --> 00:23:58,739
No.

I don't know what happened.

Don't you understand?

I can't make any sense
out of this either.

this never would have happened!

No.

Maybe we forgot

It's just so hard to accept.

You've already given your
statement to the police, Mark.

You don't have to say any more.

I'll do your talking for you.

Psychogenic repression?

You mean subconsciously
blocking out painful memories?

513
00:26:07,365 --> 00:26:08,565
Right.

514
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:10,937
In fact, he remembered some
pretty disturbing images--

515
00:26:11,036 --> 00:26:14,676
his mother-in-law's pleading
face, the daughter calling out

516
00:26:14,773 --> 00:26:16,713
in alarm, all of which
pretty much rules

517
00:26:16,808 --> 00:26:18,778
out any psychological problems.

518
00:26:18,877 --> 00:26:21,677
But there could be something
physically wrong with him.

519
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:23,280
Well, that would be my guess.

520
00:26:23,381 --> 00:26:24,551
I can run some
tests if you want.

00:26:24,649 --> 00:26:25,949
Sure, go ahead.

522
00:26:26,051 --> 00:26:26,851
All right.

523
00:26:26,952 --> 00:26:28,152
I'll start with a CAT scan.

524
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:31,553
That'll turn up any tumors,
clots, that kind of thing.

525
00:26:31,656 --> 00:26:34,796
If there's something wrong
with his brain, I'll find it.

at mine when you're done.

Christopher at school.

What could your mother
and I possibly have done

547
00:27:28,713 --> 00:27:30,813
to make him want to kill us?

548
00:27:30,915 --> 00:27:35,355
He's telling the police he
can't remember what happened.

549
00:27:35,453 --> 00:27:38,823
Your mother treated him
like he was her own son.

550
00:27:38,923 --> 00:27:41,693
I know.

551
00:27:41,793 --> 00:27:43,193
I know.

552
00:27:43,294 --> 00:27:46,734
[siren blaring]

553
00:27:48,099 --> 00:27:51,039
The night before when Schall
told his wife he wasn't tired,

554
00:27:51,136 --> 00:27:52,336
was going to watch
TV for a while--

555
00:27:52,437 --> 00:27:53,677
Mm-hmm.

556
00:27:53,772 --> 00:27:55,542
--that was so he could sneak
back without her knowing,

557
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,440
right?

558
00:27:56,541 --> 00:27:59,511
I mean, this was premeditated.

559
00:27:59,611 --> 00:28:01,381
I bet he was planning on
coming back after the murders

560
00:28:01,479 --> 00:28:04,549
and just going to bed.

561
00:28:04,649 --> 00:28:06,419
Pretend that he'd
been home all night.

562
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:10,288
And earlier when the
wife came home from work--

563
00:28:10,388 --> 00:28:11,828
on the way to the
morgue, she told me

564
00:28:11,923 --> 00:28:15,393
that he made a point of
helping her by taking her keys

565
00:28:15,493 --> 00:28:16,593
when she came in the door.

566
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:18,365
The key ring that just
happened to have the key

567
00:28:18,463 --> 00:28:20,433
to her parents' house on it.

568
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:23,572
Computer just coughed this up.

569
00:28:23,668 --> 00:28:25,108
Can I have your pickle?

570
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:26,133
No, you can't have my pickle.

571
00:28:26,237 --> 00:28:27,037
What are you, a seagull?

572
00:28:27,138 --> 00:28:29,478
Get out of here.

573
00:28:29,574 --> 00:28:32,974
Schall was arrested
three months ago for fraud.

574
00:28:35,914 --> 00:28:37,784
And the wife
never mentioned it?

575
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:39,122
Listen, why don't
you get on the phone

576
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:41,087
with the prosecutor's office,
see what you can find out?

577
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:47,026
[doorbell ringing]

578
00:28:54,466 --> 00:28:57,236
Mrs. Schall, we have a warrant
to search the premises.

579
00:28:57,335 --> 00:28:59,005
What is it you're looking for?

580
00:28:59,104 --> 00:29:01,104
It's just routine.

581
00:29:01,206 --> 00:29:02,176
Please don't wake the baby.

582
00:29:08,313 --> 00:29:09,283
[door shutting]

583
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:25,460
Mark liked to have
home-baked things?

584
00:29:25,563 --> 00:29:26,633
I guess.

585
00:29:26,731 --> 00:29:28,301
About as much as he
liked playing the ponies?

586
00:29:31,302 --> 00:29:34,942
You failed to mention his
little gambling problem.

587
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:40,009
Detective, my mother's dead,
and my husband's under arrest.

588
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:43,411
I really didn't think
it was that important.

589
00:29:43,515 --> 00:29:45,655
Your husband siphons all
the money out of your savings

590
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:48,650
account by forging your name,
then defrauds his employer

591
00:29:48,753 --> 00:29:51,193
of 30 grand and loses
it all on the track,

592
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:52,629
and you didn't think
this was important?

593
00:29:52,724 --> 00:29:55,364
I just meant-- why did
you cover up for him?

594
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,730
I didn't.

595
00:29:56,828 --> 00:29:58,568
Your father told us you
didn't tell him any of this

596
00:29:58,663 --> 00:29:59,903
until last week.

597
00:29:59,998 --> 00:30:01,538
I didn't want him to worry.

598
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:03,703
Oh, so you were just going
to pretend it never happened?

599
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:04,702
No.

600
00:30:06,771 --> 00:30:07,771
I yelled at him for days.

601
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:08,972
I threatened to leave him.

602
00:30:09,073 --> 00:30:09,873
But you didn't?

603
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:11,414
No, I didn't.

604
00:30:11,509 --> 00:30:15,309
I still loved him, even
if he had been stupid.

605
00:30:15,413 --> 00:30:17,283
He promised to start going
to Gamblers Anonymous

606
00:30:17,382 --> 00:30:19,422
and to tell my parents
what he'd done.

607
00:30:19,517 --> 00:30:20,787
And when was he
going to do that?

608
00:30:24,289 --> 00:30:25,489
The day he killed your mother?

609
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:28,890
[suspenseful music]

610
00:30:30,795 --> 00:30:35,035
OK, let me guess.

611
00:30:35,133 --> 00:30:36,603
He stays up after
you've gone to bed,

612
00:30:36,701 --> 00:30:39,801
then decides to go on
his own to tell them.

613
00:30:39,904 --> 00:30:40,804
Your mother gets angry.

614
00:30:40,905 --> 00:30:42,545
Mark gets angry.

615
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,540
Next thing you know, she's dead.

616
00:30:45,643 --> 00:30:47,783
I want to see him.

617
00:30:47,879 --> 00:30:49,079
I don't know about that.

618
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:49,980
I can't go on like this.

619
00:30:50,081 --> 00:30:52,321
I have to know why he did it.

620
00:30:52,417 --> 00:30:54,417
If he's lying, I'll know it.

621
00:31:00,758 --> 00:31:04,198
[somber instrumental music]

622
00:31:13,071 --> 00:31:14,401
Mary Ellen Matulus.

623
00:31:14,505 --> 00:31:17,445
Lloyd Boyko.

624
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:19,912
You're going to
prosecute my case?

625
00:31:20,011 --> 00:31:22,151
Actually, I understood
it was my case.

626
00:31:22,247 --> 00:31:23,747
When did you graduate?

627
00:31:23,848 --> 00:31:25,248
You prosecute murder one before?

628
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:28,190
You do know this is a
capital case, right?

629
00:31:28,286 --> 00:31:29,486
I graduated four years ago.

630
00:31:29,587 --> 00:31:31,257
I have prosecuted murder cases.

631
00:31:31,356 --> 00:31:35,456
And I've even won
a couple, Lloyd.

632
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,500
OK, Mary Ellen.

633
00:31:37,595 --> 00:31:38,965
So listen.

634
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:42,733
We have a situation
with Schall's wife.

635
00:31:42,834 --> 00:31:44,574
She wants to see him.

636
00:31:44,669 --> 00:31:46,269
Some particular reason?

637
00:31:46,371 --> 00:31:49,141
Yeah, she wants to know
why he killed her mother.

638
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,380
Now, I know legally
we can keep her out,

639
00:31:51,476 --> 00:31:53,946
but I was just wondering.

640
00:31:54,045 --> 00:31:55,175
If he's holding
something back,

641
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,920
maybe she's just the one
to get it out of him.

642
00:31:58,016 --> 00:31:58,916
[grunts]

643
00:32:00,051 --> 00:32:00,951
Good.

644
00:32:01,052 --> 00:32:01,952
Thanks.

645
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:08,430
This list of personal effects
I got from the police report,

646
00:32:08,526 --> 00:32:11,496
they don't list underwear.

647
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:16,606
Track pants, T-shirt, running
shoes, but no underwear.

648
00:32:16,701 --> 00:32:19,501
Is that how you were dressed
when they arrested you?

649
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:21,044
I guess.

650
00:32:21,139 --> 00:32:25,339
Do you normally go out
without underwear on?

651
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:27,443
No, no.

652
00:32:27,545 --> 00:32:30,185
I usually wear,
you know, briefs.

653
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:35,619
My wife is here.

654
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,550
What are you doing?

655
00:32:36,654 --> 00:32:37,454
I want to see her.

656
00:32:37,555 --> 00:32:38,795
Mark, let me see
what they want.

657
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:40,260
They could be trying
to pull something here.

658
00:32:40,358 --> 00:32:41,628
I don't care.
I want to see her.

659
00:32:41,726 --> 00:32:42,926
Mark, listen to me.

660
00:32:43,027 --> 00:32:45,227
I want to see her.

661
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:46,300
All right.

662
00:32:46,397 --> 00:32:47,297
Just give me a second.

What's going on here?

665
00:32:56,407 --> 00:32:59,707
Counselor, Mrs. Schall
is here to see her husband.

666
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:01,451
For what reason?

667
00:33:01,546 --> 00:33:02,776
I'm his wife.

668
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:03,850
Isn't that enough reason?

669
00:33:06,851 --> 00:33:08,191
All right, but you
can't go in there.

670
00:33:08,286 --> 00:33:09,926
And the guard stays out here.

671
00:33:10,021 --> 00:33:11,021
Forget it.

672
00:33:11,122 --> 00:33:13,022
Then she doesn't go in.

673
00:33:13,124 --> 00:33:14,694
I don't want anyone
else in the room.

674
00:33:14,792 --> 00:33:15,592
Fine.

675
00:33:15,693 --> 00:33:16,833
Then we all stay out here.

676
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:21,732

Stop crying.

I'm so sorry.

I'm so sorry.

00:33:57,568 --> 00:34:00,868
Tell me what happened
after I went to bed.

684
00:34:07,078 --> 00:34:11,218
All I remember
is falling asleep.

685
00:34:11,315 --> 00:34:13,785
When I woke up, I
saw your mom's face.

I don't, honey.
I swear to you.

Did you get in a
fight with my mom?

691
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:21,024
I don't know.

692
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:21,995
Why did you choke my dad?

693
00:34:22,093 --> 00:34:23,123
I'm trying to tell--

694
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:24,667
Why'd you take the
tire iron into the house?

695
00:34:24,762 --> 00:34:26,832
I don't remember.

696
00:34:26,931 --> 00:34:28,001
I don't remember.

Do you want to
see your daughter?

Can I?

Come here.

703
00:34:58,463 --> 00:35:01,033
Go see Daddy.

704
00:35:01,132 --> 00:35:05,702
See Daddy right there?

Ah.

708
00:35:12,643 --> 00:35:14,783
How you doing?

709
00:35:14,879 --> 00:35:17,219
How you doing?

710
00:35:17,315 --> 00:35:18,285
I missed you so much.

711
00:35:21,018 --> 00:35:22,558
How are your hands?

712
00:35:22,653 --> 00:35:23,553
They hurt.

713
00:35:27,225 --> 00:35:29,365
Is your father better?

to discharge him.

you can tell me.

DOCTOR: That's the CAT scan.

721
00:35:51,415 --> 00:35:53,815
I was looking particularly
for signs of epilepsy.

722
00:35:53,918 --> 00:35:56,118
People can be quite
violent during seizures.

723
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:59,660
But there's nothing here.

724
00:35:59,757 --> 00:36:04,267
The EEG turned up no signs of
abnormal electrical activity.

725
00:36:04,362 --> 00:36:05,432
That's the blood work--

726
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:08,630
no evidence of drug
toxicity, no evidence

727
00:36:08,733 --> 00:36:11,773
of psychosis or
antisocial behavior.

728
00:36:11,869 --> 00:36:13,339
So what you're telling me is--

729
00:36:13,437 --> 00:36:15,837
He's perfectly normal.

730
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:17,910
Which means we still don't
know why he doesn't remember

731
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:19,079
what happened that night.

732
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:23,983
Great.

733
00:36:24,081 --> 00:36:24,981
Great.

734
00:36:28,753 --> 00:36:29,553
There they are.

735
00:36:29,654 --> 00:36:30,554
Let's go.

736
00:36:38,329 --> 00:36:40,099
Mrs. Schall, how do you
feel about the prosecutor's

737
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:42,368
decision to seek the death
penalty against your husband?

738
00:36:42,466 --> 00:36:43,506
We just buried our mother.

739
00:36:43,601 --> 00:36:46,001
Can't you have a little
respect for our privacy?

740
00:36:46,103 --> 00:36:47,943
I'll tell you what I think.

741
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:49,579
If I had a gun and he
would stand in front of me,

742
00:36:49,674 --> 00:36:50,574
I'd kill him myself.

743
00:36:50,675 --> 00:36:51,945
One of the nurses
at the hospital

744
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:53,173
told me you embraced
your husband

745
00:36:53,277 --> 00:36:54,077
when you went to visit him.

746
00:36:54,178 --> 00:36:55,148
How do you feel about him today?

747
00:36:55,246 --> 00:36:56,146
Will you leave us alone?

748
00:36:56,247 --> 00:36:57,147
REPORTER: I'm sorry.

749
00:36:57,248 --> 00:36:58,418
Can I at least call you later?
- No.

750
00:36:58,516 --> 00:36:59,316
No, please.

751
00:36:59,417 --> 00:37:00,347
Come on.

752
00:37:00,451 --> 00:37:02,491
Let's go.

753
00:37:02,587 --> 00:37:04,157
You went to see Mark?

754
00:37:04,255 --> 00:37:05,555
I had to.

755
00:37:05,656 --> 00:37:08,796
I had to find out if he really
can't remember what happened.

756
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:11,163
I didn't tell you because
I knew it would upset you.

757
00:37:11,262 --> 00:37:12,262
You hugged him?

758
00:37:12,363 --> 00:37:13,863
Christopher, please.

759
00:37:13,965 --> 00:37:15,665
It's more complicated
than you think.

760
00:37:15,766 --> 00:37:17,406
No, there's nothing
complicated about it.

761
00:37:17,501 --> 00:37:19,271
He killed our mother.

762
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:20,940
Is everything all right here?

763
00:37:21,038 --> 00:37:21,838
Yeah.

764
00:37:21,939 --> 00:37:23,179
We're OK, Dad.

765
00:37:28,813 --> 00:37:30,113
[clinking]

766
00:37:30,214 --> 00:37:32,954
BOYKO: Time to move.

767
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:33,850
Where are we going?

768
00:37:33,951 --> 00:37:34,751
[chains rattling]

769
00:37:34,852 --> 00:37:36,692
BOYKO: County lockup.

770
00:37:36,787 --> 00:37:39,427
I won't try to escape.

771
00:37:39,523 --> 00:37:40,923
Standard procedure.

772
00:37:41,025 --> 00:37:44,495
[chains rattling]

773
00:38:03,381 --> 00:38:04,811
BROOKE: There's a
rational explanation

774
00:38:04,915 --> 00:38:06,355
for his inability to remember.

775
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:08,650
We're just not seeing it.

776
00:38:08,753 --> 00:38:11,053
Lying is a
rational explanation.

777
00:38:11,155 --> 00:38:13,055
Jimmy, do you know
of a single case

778
00:38:13,157 --> 00:38:15,397
where someone goes out to
commit premeditated murder

779
00:38:15,493 --> 00:38:17,193
without bothering to
put on his underwear?

780
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:20,035
[chuckles] Well,
you got a point.

781
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:21,461
[phone ringing]

782
00:38:21,565 --> 00:38:23,565
You know, it is
pretty remarkable,

783
00:38:23,668 --> 00:38:25,638
the consistency in
all these reports

784
00:38:25,736 --> 00:38:27,706
about what he does remember--

785
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:30,205
his mother-in-law's face,
racing up the stairs,

786
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:32,148
the bloody knife in the car.

787
00:38:32,243 --> 00:38:34,643
You know how people's
stories usually change.

788
00:38:34,745 --> 00:38:37,715
"I woke up and saw my
mother-in-law's face.

789
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:40,385
I woke up in the car."

790
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:41,724
JIMMY: Yeah.

791
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:44,919
"I woke up."

792
00:38:45,022 --> 00:38:47,462
He felt as if he'd
been sleeping.

793
00:38:47,558 --> 00:38:49,158
Sleeping?

794
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:51,200
You think he was sleepwalking?

795
00:38:51,295 --> 00:38:54,095
It makes as much
sense as anything else.

796
00:38:54,198 --> 00:38:55,338
I guess it's too
late to go see Mark.

797
00:38:55,433 --> 00:38:56,303
JIMMY: Brooke, wait a minute.

798
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,300
Wait a minute.

799
00:38:57,401 --> 00:38:58,671
Are you serious about this?

800
00:38:58,769 --> 00:39:00,839
You got a better idea, Jimmy?

801
00:39:00,938 --> 00:39:02,908
No, but sleepwalking?

802
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:04,777
Who else would know
if he sleepwalks?

803
00:39:08,145 --> 00:39:10,045
[doorbell ringing]

804
00:39:14,385 --> 00:39:15,825
[door opening]

805
00:39:16,787 --> 00:39:18,757
Mrs. Schall, I'm Brooke McAdam.

806
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:20,996
I'm representing your husband.

807
00:39:21,092 --> 00:39:23,692
There's something very important
I'd like to discuss with you.

808
00:39:23,794 --> 00:39:25,394
Look, I don't think I
should be talking to you.

809
00:39:25,496 --> 00:39:27,036
It'll only take a few minutes.

810
00:39:27,131 --> 00:39:30,331
My family's already
really upset with me.

811
00:39:30,434 --> 00:39:33,104
And to be honest, I don't
know what to think about Mark.

812
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:34,004
Please.

813
00:39:34,105 --> 00:39:35,975
[phone ringing]

814
00:39:37,641 --> 00:39:38,441
Hold on.

815
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:39,982
[phone ringing]

816
00:39:41,946 --> 00:39:42,816
[beep]

817
00:39:42,913 --> 00:39:43,713
Hello?

818
00:39:43,814 --> 00:39:45,014
MARK (ON PHONE): Lauren?

819
00:39:45,116 --> 00:39:46,446
It's Mark.

820
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:47,820
What's the matter?

821
00:39:47,918 --> 00:39:50,688
MARK (ON PHONE): I'm sorry
to call, but my hands--

822
00:39:50,788 --> 00:39:51,958
I got a lot of pain.

823
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:53,596
The guards won't get
the nurse for me,

824
00:39:53,691 --> 00:39:55,391
and I tried to call my lawyer.

825
00:39:55,493 --> 00:39:56,293
Hold on.

826
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:58,964
She's right here.

827
00:39:59,063 --> 00:39:59,963
It's Mark.

828
00:40:03,701 --> 00:40:04,801
Hello?
MARK (ON PHONE): Hi.

829
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:05,932
It's Mark.

830
00:40:06,036 --> 00:40:07,476
I tried to reach
you at your office.

831
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:10,671
I'm having some
trouble with my hands.

832
00:40:10,775 --> 00:40:12,915
What is it?

833
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:14,550
So you need some medication?

834
00:40:17,848 --> 00:40:18,918
Very well, very well.

835
00:40:19,016 --> 00:40:21,086
I'll take care of it right away.

836
00:40:21,185 --> 00:40:26,225
[hangs up phone]

837
00:40:26,323 --> 00:40:28,063
I know the head of
medical services.

838
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:30,299
I'll use my car
phone to call him.

839
00:40:30,394 --> 00:40:32,994
He'll see that Mark
gets some medication.

840
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:34,437
Good night.

841
00:40:34,532 --> 00:40:39,502
Whatever it is you want,
I'll tell you whatever I know,

842
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:41,473
but only in front of Mark.

843
00:40:41,572 --> 00:40:43,972
I want him to know
exactly what I've said.

844
00:40:44,074 --> 00:40:44,974
Fine.

845
00:40:50,147 --> 00:40:52,987
[music playing]

846
00:40:53,083 --> 00:40:55,523
I felt from the beginning that
if we could determine why you

847
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:57,419
don't remember anything,
we'd find out what

848
00:40:57,521 --> 00:40:59,321
really happened that night.

849
00:40:59,423 --> 00:41:00,963
So last night, Jimmy
and I were going

850
00:41:01,058 --> 00:41:04,298
over your various statements
about what you do remember.

851
00:41:04,395 --> 00:41:07,665
Over and over again, Mark,
you use the same words--

852
00:41:07,765 --> 00:41:10,705
"I woke up."

853
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:12,801
Do you think it's possible
you were sleepwalking?

854
00:41:12,903 --> 00:41:15,173
What do you mean, I drove
to their house in my sleep?

855
00:41:15,272 --> 00:41:16,472
I can't believe this.

856
00:41:16,574 --> 00:41:17,874
I came here because
I want to know

857
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:20,075
the truth about what happened.

858
00:41:20,177 --> 00:41:21,777
And now I find out
you want me to help

859
00:41:21,879 --> 00:41:25,449
you cook up some dumb defense?

860
00:41:25,549 --> 00:41:26,349
I'm sorry.

861
00:41:26,450 --> 00:41:27,690
I won't be any part of this.

862
00:41:37,228 --> 00:41:39,498
Years ago, I'd wake up
in the middle of the night

863
00:41:39,597 --> 00:41:40,997
and smell bacon frying.

864
00:41:41,098 --> 00:41:43,738
And that's how I knew that
Howard, my late husband,

865
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:46,734
was in the kitchen
again in his underwear,

866
00:41:46,837 --> 00:41:49,977
making breakfast sound asleep--

867
00:41:50,074 --> 00:41:52,774
bacon, scrambled
eggs, fried onions.

868
00:41:52,877 --> 00:41:55,617
He'd have all four
burners going.

869
00:41:55,713 --> 00:41:59,483
The first time, I actually
found it sort of funny

870
00:41:59,583 --> 00:42:01,623
until I tried to wake him.

871
00:42:01,719 --> 00:42:05,059
And he whirled right
around and swung at me.

872
00:42:05,155 --> 00:42:06,555
[screaming]

873
00:42:07,992 --> 00:42:10,262
BROOKE: These people are asleep?

874
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:12,431
[screaming]

875
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:14,270
Sound asleep.

876
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:15,665
When they wake up,
they have absolutely

877
00:42:15,766 --> 00:42:18,106
no memory of what they've done.

878
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:20,242
Can sleepwalkers
be violent too?

879
00:42:20,337 --> 00:42:23,237
Oh, yeah, no doubt about that.

880
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:25,840
They seem to have some sort
of preset program of behavior

881
00:42:25,943 --> 00:42:27,073
they're trying to carry out.

882
00:42:27,177 --> 00:42:29,247
And if you get in their way,
if you try to stop them,

883
00:42:29,346 --> 00:42:30,316
they'll fight you.

884
00:42:30,414 --> 00:42:32,354
BROOKE: So do you think
it's possible Mark

885
00:42:32,449 --> 00:42:35,719
Schall was sleepwalking?

886
00:42:35,819 --> 00:42:39,619
Well, it's possible.

887
00:42:39,723 --> 00:42:41,323
[clock chiming]

888
00:42:41,425 --> 00:42:44,525
But I have to say, based
on what you've told me,

889
00:42:44,628 --> 00:42:48,968
my guess is he's lying.

890
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:52,506
You see, adults sleepwalk for
only brief periods of time,

891
00:42:52,603 --> 00:42:55,503
maybe 10 to 40 minutes.

892
00:42:55,606 --> 00:42:57,476
That's not enough time to
accomplish all the things

893
00:42:57,575 --> 00:42:59,645
you've told me this man did.

894
00:42:59,743 --> 00:43:04,313
And also his actions
sound so complex.

895
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:05,915
It's not impossible
for sleepwalking,

896
00:43:06,016 --> 00:43:07,556
but it's unlikely.

897
00:43:07,651 --> 00:43:11,851
Dr. Corrigan, would you at
least examine Mark Schall?

898
00:43:11,956 --> 00:43:13,856
Ms. McAdam, I'll be
very honest with you.

899
00:43:13,958 --> 00:43:16,058
If I thought there was
a reasonable chance

900
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,730
that this man was
sleepwalking, I'd be

901
00:43:17,828 --> 00:43:19,768
very interested in seeing him.

902
00:43:19,863 --> 00:43:24,233
But as it is, I'm just swamped.

903
00:43:24,335 --> 00:43:26,075
Doctor, it's true, isn't
it, that sleepwalking

904
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:28,070
can be genetic?

905
00:43:28,172 --> 00:43:29,742
It does run in families, yes.

906
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:31,180
Mark's grandfather
used to get up

907
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:33,915
in the middle of the night and
cook breakfast in his sleep.

908
00:43:34,011 --> 00:43:34,811
Eggs and bacon?

909
00:43:34,912 --> 00:43:35,712
[chuckles]

910
00:43:35,813 --> 00:43:38,353
Sometimes steak.

911
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:39,819
And isn't it also
true that going

912
00:43:39,917 --> 00:43:43,717
without sleep for long periods
can trigger sleepwalking?

913
00:43:43,821 --> 00:43:45,191
You've been doing
your homework.

914
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:47,429
Mark told me that he had had
almost no sleep during the two

915
00:43:47,524 --> 00:43:48,724
days before the crime.

916
00:43:48,826 --> 00:43:51,526
He was under a lot of stress
related to gambling debts.

917
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:55,965
What time did the
murder take place?

918
00:43:56,066 --> 00:43:57,836
Between 3:30 and
4:00 in the morning.

919
00:43:57,935 --> 00:43:59,305
Is that important?

920
00:43:59,403 --> 00:44:00,233
Yeah.

921
00:44:00,337 --> 00:44:02,537
You see, sleepwalking
episodes always

922
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:05,640
take place within the first
two or three hours of sleep.

923
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:10,886
Mark told me he stayed up
watching TV until after 1

924
00:44:10,981 --> 00:44:12,781
o'clock that night.

925
00:44:12,883 --> 00:44:14,383
So doesn't that fit
your time frame?

926
00:44:20,591 --> 00:44:23,691
Maybe I could find
some time next week.

927
00:44:23,794 --> 00:44:27,264
[instrumental music]

928
00:44:30,234 --> 00:44:33,704
[dishes clinking]

929
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:35,071
Hi.

930
00:44:45,382 --> 00:44:46,282
Thanks.

931
00:44:50,387 --> 00:44:52,787
Oh, my dear, what you
must be going through.

932
00:44:55,926 --> 00:44:57,966
I wanted so much to
come to the funeral.

933
00:44:58,062 --> 00:45:00,032
I just wasn't sure
it was appropriate.

934
00:45:00,097 --> 00:45:01,567
I understand.

935
00:45:05,069 --> 00:45:06,399
You know, she always
told me you were

936
00:45:06,503 --> 00:45:10,043
her best friend in the world.

937
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:11,310
She was my best friend.

938
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:17,686
I went to see Mark.

939
00:45:17,781 --> 00:45:18,581
I know.

940
00:45:18,682 --> 00:45:20,122
He told me.

941
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:23,517
That was very courageous of you.

942
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:28,160
[sighs] I have this
pain in my heart.

943
00:45:28,258 --> 00:45:30,158
And I feel like if
I could understand

944
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:34,430
why my mom had to die, it
might go away just a little.

945
00:45:34,531 --> 00:45:37,071
You know what his
lawyer thinks, don't you?

946
00:45:37,167 --> 00:45:37,937
Yes.

947
00:45:38,035 --> 00:45:39,575
And I think it's ridiculous.

948
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:41,810
Oh, now, dear, how
can you be so certain?

949
00:45:41,905 --> 00:45:44,445
Eileen, I know how
much you care about Mark,

950
00:45:44,541 --> 00:45:47,181
how much you'd like to find some
innocent explanation for what

951
00:45:47,277 --> 00:45:48,577
happened.

952
00:45:48,679 --> 00:45:50,379
And no one wants to know what
really happened more than me.

953
00:45:50,481 --> 00:45:53,021
But come on, sleepwalking?

954
00:45:53,117 --> 00:45:57,587
Lauren, it's not
that far-fetched.

955
00:45:57,688 --> 00:45:59,188
Mark sleptwalk as a child.

956
00:45:59,289 --> 00:46:00,889
Did you know that?

957
00:46:00,991 --> 00:46:02,761
He did.

958
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:04,530
I heard a noise in
his bedroom one night.

959
00:46:04,628 --> 00:46:06,098
And when I went in
to check on him,

960
00:46:06,196 --> 00:46:08,796
he was halfway out the window.

961
00:46:08,899 --> 00:46:10,869
He almost killed himself.

962
00:46:10,968 --> 00:46:13,438
Well, that's a very nice
story with a nice, happy ending.

963
00:46:13,537 --> 00:46:15,077
Unfortunately, my
mother's story didn't

964
00:46:15,172 --> 00:46:17,842
have such a happy ending because
your innocent grandson killed

965
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:18,841
her.

966
00:46:22,379 --> 00:46:23,579
Who's the big girl today?

967
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:25,080
MARK: It's birthday time.
LAUREN: All right, Kimberly.

968
00:46:25,182 --> 00:46:26,282
Good girl.
You ready?

969
00:46:26,383 --> 00:46:27,213
Want to blow your candles?

970
00:46:27,317 --> 00:46:29,987
[blows] Yay!

971
00:46:30,087 --> 00:46:31,857
Happy birthday, sweetheart.

972
00:46:31,955 --> 00:46:33,455
You know, I would have
baked this cake myself,

973
00:46:33,557 --> 00:46:35,657
but I'm afraid I'm just
not the cook your mom was.

974
00:46:35,759 --> 00:46:36,859
LAUREN: Oh, it's great, Dad.

975
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:37,930
She looks so cute.

976
00:46:38,028 --> 00:46:38,998
Is that new?

977
00:46:39,096 --> 00:46:40,696
Yeah, my neighbors
took up a collection.

978
00:46:40,798 --> 00:46:43,138
They got her a lot
of nice dresses.

979
00:46:43,233 --> 00:46:44,773
She looks nicer than I do.

980
00:46:44,868 --> 00:46:45,868
ROTH: Ah.

981
00:46:45,969 --> 00:46:48,539
Mom would get a laugh
seeing me try to iron.

982
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:51,779
Well, it doesn't
look that bad.

983
00:46:51,875 --> 00:46:52,945
So have you been to see Mark?

984
00:46:55,946 --> 00:46:57,076
Yes.

985
00:46:57,181 --> 00:46:59,421
His lawyer wanted to
ask me some questions.

986
00:47:02,486 --> 00:47:05,186
How can you have
anything to do with him?

987
00:47:05,289 --> 00:47:08,789
Because he's my
husband, Christopher,

988
00:47:08,892 --> 00:47:11,392
and the father of my child.

989
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:14,665
Because he worked two jobs
so we could buy a home,

990
00:47:14,765 --> 00:47:17,935
and he used to make me tea
when I came home from work.

991
00:47:18,035 --> 00:47:21,435
Don't you see I can't
just forget all that?

992
00:47:21,538 --> 00:47:22,908
Is this the same
Mark who sneaked around

993
00:47:23,006 --> 00:47:26,976
and gambled, stole from
his employer and from you,

994
00:47:27,077 --> 00:47:29,117
then lied about it?

995
00:47:29,213 --> 00:47:31,353
Maybe that's the real Mark.

996
00:47:31,448 --> 00:47:34,488
Maybe that's the Mark
who killed your mother.

997
00:47:34,585 --> 00:47:37,885
Well, that's the
question, isn't it, Dad?

998
00:47:37,988 --> 00:47:40,558
And we don't know,
do we, none of us.

999
00:47:40,657 --> 00:47:43,357
You're all ready to send
him to the electric chair.

1000
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:45,060
No, you're ready to hug
him and take him home.

1001
00:47:50,567 --> 00:47:53,107
TANYA: I remember the night
I saw Lauren at her lowest.

1002
00:47:53,203 --> 00:47:55,343
She'd gone to the phone and
started to dial her mother's

1003
00:47:55,439 --> 00:47:57,939
number without even thinking.

1004
00:47:58,041 --> 00:47:59,211
Suddenly realized
what she was doing

1005
00:47:59,309 --> 00:48:02,409
and just sat down and sobbed.

1006
00:48:02,512 --> 00:48:03,752
Her mother was the
one person she could

1007
00:48:03,847 --> 00:48:06,447
always talk to about things.

1008
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:10,320
And then when she needed her
mother most, she was gone.

1009
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:11,220
MARK (ON TV): Excuse me.

1010
00:48:11,321 --> 00:48:12,521
Can we take your order?

1011
00:48:12,623 --> 00:48:13,423
[laughs]

1012
00:48:13,523 --> 00:48:14,563
LAUREN (ON TV): Hi.

1013
00:48:14,658 --> 00:48:16,628
MARK (VOICEOVER): Dear
Lauren, I've had a lot

1014
00:48:16,727 --> 00:48:19,827
of time to think about things.

1015
00:48:19,930 --> 00:48:22,370
I still don't understand
what happened.

1016
00:48:22,466 --> 00:48:26,306
I feel such shame and guilt
over your mom's death.

1017
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:30,373
I love you and
Kimberly so very much,

1018
00:48:30,474 --> 00:48:34,214
but I can't bear the thought
of destroying your lives too.

1019
00:48:34,311 --> 00:48:37,581
So I think the best
thing is for you

1020
00:48:37,681 --> 00:48:40,381
to go ahead and get a divorce.

1021
00:48:40,484 --> 00:48:41,924
You're still young.

1022
00:48:42,019 --> 00:48:46,159
You can find someone and
can have a happy life.

1023
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:49,256
And Kimberly will need a father.

1024
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:51,199
This is the hardest thing
I've ever had to do.

1025
00:48:53,463 --> 00:48:54,363
Mark.

1026
00:49:06,910 --> 00:49:08,950
Hi.

1027
00:49:09,046 --> 00:49:10,686
Can we talk?

1028
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:12,781
I only have a couple
minutes left on my break.

1029
00:49:16,019 --> 00:49:17,419
I don't blame you
for being skeptical

1030
00:49:17,521 --> 00:49:19,391
about the sleepwalking idea.

1031
00:49:19,489 --> 00:49:21,189
I'm not sure myself.

1032
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:25,561
I hired a sleep disorder expert,
one of the best in the country.

1033
00:49:25,662 --> 00:49:28,302
He's flying here next
week to examine Mark.

1034
00:49:28,398 --> 00:49:31,138
You're welcome to
observe, no obligations.

1035
00:49:31,234 --> 00:49:33,134
Why would I want to do that?

1036
00:49:33,236 --> 00:49:34,276
Because I think
you want to know

1037
00:49:34,371 --> 00:49:35,811
the truth about what happened.

1038
00:49:35,906 --> 00:49:39,446
What does it matter
to you what I think?

1039
00:49:39,543 --> 00:49:41,213
I won't try to
fool you, Lauren.

1040
00:49:41,311 --> 00:49:42,981
I want you on Mark's side.

1041
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:47,350
If possible, I'd like you
to testify at his trial.

1042
00:49:47,451 --> 00:49:50,421
What could I
possibly testify about?

1043
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:52,890
Lauren, nobody
knows Mark the way

1044
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:56,260
you do, what he's capable
of, what he isn't capable of.

1045
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:58,700
I think any jury would
put a great deal of weight

1046
00:49:58,795 --> 00:50:00,065
on anything you had to say.

1047
00:50:02,933 --> 00:50:06,233
I just have too
many questions.

1048
00:50:06,336 --> 00:50:07,236
What?

1049
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:12,540
My keys.

1050
00:50:12,642 --> 00:50:16,412
Detective Boyko thinks that Mark
took my keys from me on purpose

1051
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:18,153
when I came home that night.

1052
00:50:18,248 --> 00:50:20,948
You mean the ring that had
the key to your parents' house?

1053
00:50:21,051 --> 00:50:23,791
Where would you have put them
if Mark hadn't taken them?

1054
00:50:23,887 --> 00:50:25,827
On the table by
the front door.

1055
00:50:25,922 --> 00:50:27,062
And where did he put them?

1056
00:50:30,761 --> 00:50:32,601
On the table by
the front door.

1057
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:35,336
So you see, he probably was
just trying to be helpful.

1058
00:50:39,302 --> 00:50:43,712
But why did he take my
keys when he left that night?

1059
00:50:43,807 --> 00:50:46,347
Mark told me that you both
kept your keys on that table

1060
00:50:46,443 --> 00:50:47,883
by the door and
that neither of you

1061
00:50:47,978 --> 00:50:50,348
paid much attention to which set
you grabbed when you went out.

1062
00:50:50,447 --> 00:50:51,347
Is that right?

1063
00:50:55,285 --> 00:50:56,985
Listen, Lauren.

1064
00:50:57,087 --> 00:50:59,457
You're right to raise questions
about Mark's behavior.

1065
00:50:59,556 --> 00:51:00,926
That's what I'm doing as well.

1066
00:51:01,024 --> 00:51:03,624
And that's how we'll
eventually find out the truth

1067
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:04,827
about what happened that night.

1068
00:51:04,928 --> 00:51:07,998
But I simply can't find
anything suspicious in his

1069
00:51:08,098 --> 00:51:09,798
trying to help you
when you came in.

1070
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:19,240
Eileen also told
me that her husband

1071
00:51:19,342 --> 00:51:24,252
used to make grunting sounds
while he cooked in his sleep.

1072
00:51:24,347 --> 00:51:25,987
Of course, that's
typical of sleepwalkers.

1073
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:28,383
They think they're verbalizing,
but, in fact, they're

1074
00:51:28,485 --> 00:51:30,525
just making guttural sounds.

1075
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:32,690
And there was this
Great Aunt Lil.

1076
00:51:32,789 --> 00:51:35,589
She used to shout
out in her sleep.

1077
00:51:35,692 --> 00:51:38,562
And her son Dennis walked
barefoot through the snow

1078
00:51:38,662 --> 00:51:40,702
to a neighbor's one time.

1079
00:51:40,797 --> 00:51:42,797
Then there's Uncle Burt.

1080
00:51:42,899 --> 00:51:45,899
He used to run around in the
yard of their summer cottage

1081
00:51:46,002 --> 00:51:47,302
while fast asleep.

1082
00:51:47,404 --> 00:51:51,744
All in all, there's no question
Mark is genetically prone.

1083
00:51:51,842 --> 00:51:54,942
So you believe he
was sleepwalking?

1084
00:51:55,045 --> 00:51:55,915
No.

1085
00:51:56,012 --> 00:51:59,282
No, I'm not prepared
to say that yet.

1086
00:51:59,382 --> 00:52:01,152
But I am impressed.

1087
00:52:01,251 --> 00:52:03,351
What more do you need?

1088
00:52:03,453 --> 00:52:06,023
Well, if Mark is truly
a sleepwalker, then

1089
00:52:06,123 --> 00:52:09,763
his brainwave patterns while
sleeping would be abnormal,

1090
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:12,000
sort of a fingerprint
for sleepwalkers.

1091
00:52:12,095 --> 00:52:14,295
How would we find that out?

1092
00:52:14,397 --> 00:52:16,837
There's only one way.

1093
00:52:16,933 --> 00:52:19,333
Every one of us goes
through a regular cycle

1094
00:52:19,436 --> 00:52:22,806
of sleep each night that
involves five stages.

1095
00:52:22,906 --> 00:52:25,776
Now, you see how his eyes
are moving rapidly there?

1096
00:52:25,876 --> 00:52:28,846
Right now Mark is
in the first level.

1097
00:52:28,945 --> 00:52:32,245
It's a relatively light
stage of sleep characterized

1098
00:52:32,349 --> 00:52:35,689
by these rapid eye movements,
which is why we call it R-E-M,

1099
00:52:35,785 --> 00:52:37,355
REM sleep.

1100
00:52:37,454 --> 00:52:39,424
It's actually in this
stage, REM sleep,

1101
00:52:39,523 --> 00:52:43,023
that we experience dreaming.

1102
00:52:43,126 --> 00:52:44,096
JIMMY: Here's your coffee.

1103
00:52:44,194 --> 00:52:45,294
Thank you.

1104
00:52:45,395 --> 00:52:48,165
You see, the rapid eye
movements have diminished.

1105
00:52:48,265 --> 00:52:51,765
And we're starting to get
this slow rolling of the eye.

1106
00:52:51,868 --> 00:52:54,268
That's because he's
moving out of REM sleep

1107
00:52:54,371 --> 00:52:56,741
and into a deeper level
of non-dreaming sleep.

1108
00:53:01,511 --> 00:53:06,421
All right, he's well
into level three now.

1109
00:53:06,516 --> 00:53:07,886
And here we're
seeing the beginning

1110
00:53:07,984 --> 00:53:10,754
of some isolated slow waves.

1111
00:53:10,854 --> 00:53:11,984
They're going to
become more abundant

1112
00:53:12,088 --> 00:53:15,388
as he progresses into even
deeper levels of sleep.

1113
00:53:15,492 --> 00:53:16,392
BROOKE: Jimmy.

1114
00:53:19,296 --> 00:53:23,166
Mark is now in fourth
level slow wave sleep.

1115
00:53:23,266 --> 00:53:25,436
That's the deepest sleep of all.

1116
00:53:25,535 --> 00:53:28,335
You see the amplitude
of the brainwave,

1117
00:53:28,438 --> 00:53:31,208
sort of like large ocean waves.

1118
00:53:31,308 --> 00:53:33,348
This is when people sleepwalk.

1119
00:53:37,747 --> 00:53:42,457
Normally, adults spend about 10%
of their time in deep sleep--

1120
00:53:42,552 --> 00:53:44,492
children much more, about 40%.

1121
00:53:44,588 --> 00:53:46,328
So that's why kids
sleepwalk so much.

1122
00:53:46,423 --> 00:53:48,423
They're in deep sleep
more of the time.

1123
00:53:48,525 --> 00:53:50,025
DR. CORRIGAN: That's right.

1124
00:53:50,126 --> 00:53:56,166
Well, Mark spent about 30% of
his time in deep sleep tonight.

1125
00:53:56,266 --> 00:53:57,496
Three times normal.

1126
00:53:57,601 --> 00:54:00,701
[sighs] He has the abnormal
sleep pattern, the personal

1127
00:54:00,804 --> 00:54:02,804
history, the genetic history.

1128
00:54:02,906 --> 00:54:04,776
And the days just
before, he'd experienced

1129
00:54:04,874 --> 00:54:08,544
sleeplessness and great
stress, two known triggers.

1130
00:54:08,645 --> 00:54:12,015
All the police descriptions fit.

1131
00:54:12,115 --> 00:54:15,555
In my opinion, there
isn't much doubt.

1132
00:54:15,652 --> 00:54:17,992
He was sleepwalking on the
night he went to your mother's.

1133
00:54:27,330 --> 00:54:31,100
I don't see what
difference it makes whether I

1134
00:54:31,201 --> 00:54:34,671
was sleepwalking or not.

1135
00:54:34,771 --> 00:54:36,311
I killed Anne.

1136
00:54:36,406 --> 00:54:40,146
Mark, we know how badly you
feel, but it isn't that simple.

1137
00:54:40,243 --> 00:54:42,283
It isn't just a matter of
whether or not your actions

1138
00:54:42,379 --> 00:54:43,709
led to Anne's death.

1139
00:54:43,813 --> 00:54:47,413
The real question is,
were you to blame?

1140
00:54:47,517 --> 00:54:48,857
I did it.

1141
00:54:48,952 --> 00:54:52,552
Mark, someone's driving a car.

1142
00:54:52,656 --> 00:54:54,456
He has a heart
attack and black out.

1143
00:54:54,557 --> 00:54:57,627
The car swerves onto the
sidewalk and hits a pedestrian.

1144
00:54:57,727 --> 00:55:00,527
Is the driver at fault?

1145
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:01,800
No.

1146
00:55:01,898 --> 00:55:05,438
There's nothing you
could have done, right?

1147
00:55:05,535 --> 00:55:07,005
Could you have done
anything to prevent

1148
00:55:07,103 --> 00:55:08,773
Anne from being hurt?

1149
00:55:08,872 --> 00:55:10,312
I don't know what.

1150
00:55:10,407 --> 00:55:12,747
You didn't make a conscious
decision to hurt her, did you?

1151
00:55:12,842 --> 00:55:13,942
MARK: No, of course not.

1152
00:55:14,044 --> 00:55:15,214
You didn't know
what you were doing.

1153
00:55:15,312 --> 00:55:16,312
You were blacked out.

1154
00:55:16,413 --> 00:55:17,313
You were asleep.

1155
00:55:27,157 --> 00:55:29,397
Yeah.

1156
00:55:29,492 --> 00:55:30,462
I guess you're right.

1157
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:34,700
I mean, there's nothing
I could have done.

1158
00:55:34,798 --> 00:55:37,938
Well, I haven't put
it to her directly yet,

1159
00:55:38,034 --> 00:55:39,634
but I think there's a
good chance that Lauren

1160
00:55:39,736 --> 00:55:41,306
will testify for you.
- No.

1161
00:55:41,404 --> 00:55:42,944
- Why not?
- No.

1162
00:55:43,039 --> 00:55:44,409
I'm not going to put
her in that position.

1163
00:55:44,507 --> 00:55:46,177
Her family would
never forgive her.

1164
00:55:46,276 --> 00:55:48,546
Mark, Lauren's testimony
could be critical.

1165
00:55:48,645 --> 00:55:51,185
If the jury has any lingering
doubt, she could sway them.

1166
00:55:51,281 --> 00:55:55,921
No, not after what I have
already put her through, OK?

1167
00:55:56,019 --> 00:55:56,919
No.

1168
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:02,860
BOYKO: Well, I'll tell you,
I thought I'd heard it all.

1169
00:56:02,959 --> 00:56:04,699
You know, at first, it was
the guy in San Francisco who

1170
00:56:04,794 --> 00:56:06,194
goes and shoots the
mayor, and then blames it

1171
00:56:06,296 --> 00:56:08,166
all on the Twinkies he'd eaten.

1172
00:56:08,264 --> 00:56:10,904
Then there was some bozo in
Florida who kills his ex-wife

1173
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:14,040
and says it was because he
had a hyperactive thyroid.

1174
00:56:14,137 --> 00:56:18,177
But when I heard that
Mark Schall was going

1175
00:56:18,274 --> 00:56:21,914
to plead that he'd been
sleepwalking, I mean,

1176
00:56:22,011 --> 00:56:23,551
that really took the cake.

1177
00:56:23,646 --> 00:56:26,386
To me, it was just another
way to try to beat her out.

1178
00:56:26,483 --> 00:56:30,323
And to be honest, I had no doubt
that our own experts would blow

1179
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:32,420
him right out of the water.

1180
00:56:32,522 --> 00:56:35,062
And the bloody footprints
come out of the house

1181
00:56:35,158 --> 00:56:37,398
and then start around
the house right here.

1182
00:56:37,494 --> 00:56:39,024
Headed for the
Lane's driveway.

1183
00:56:39,129 --> 00:56:40,099
No.

1184
00:56:40,196 --> 00:56:41,266
No, you see, that's
not where he parked.

1185
00:56:41,364 --> 00:56:43,234
He parked over here in
the neighbor's driveway.

1186
00:56:43,333 --> 00:56:46,873
So from the footprints it looks
like Schall stood at the corner

1187
00:56:46,970 --> 00:56:49,010
of the house, shuffling
around like he was looking

1188
00:56:49,105 --> 00:56:51,505
for his car, and
then remembered that

1189
00:56:51,608 --> 00:56:54,878
he parked at the neighbor's.

1190
00:56:54,978 --> 00:56:56,208
The point being?

1191
00:56:56,312 --> 00:56:58,212
The point being that if
he was really sleepwalking,

1192
00:56:58,314 --> 00:56:59,784
he would have parked
where he always parked,

1193
00:56:59,883 --> 00:57:01,313
in the Lane's driveway.

1194
00:57:01,418 --> 00:57:03,858
You know, sleepwalkers are
supposed to do familiar things.

1195
00:57:03,953 --> 00:57:05,923
Instead of parking where
no one could see his car.

1196
00:57:06,022 --> 00:57:07,052
Exactly.

1197
00:57:07,157 --> 00:57:08,797
Sounds like fairly
conscious behavior to me.

1198
00:57:08,892 --> 00:57:09,862
Damn right.

1199
00:57:09,959 --> 00:57:11,059
Ms. Matulus.

1200
00:57:11,161 --> 00:57:12,461
- Oh, Dr. O'Brien.
- Yes.

1201
00:57:12,562 --> 00:57:14,002
Your office told me I
could find you here.

1202
00:57:14,097 --> 00:57:15,267
- You've been to see Schall?
- Yes.

1203
00:57:15,365 --> 00:57:16,295
I just left.

1204
00:57:16,399 --> 00:57:19,669
Is there someplace
private we can talk?

1205
00:57:19,769 --> 00:57:20,569
Yeah.

1206
00:57:20,670 --> 00:57:22,310
We can-- just over here.

1207
00:57:22,405 --> 00:57:24,605
I thought I should let you
know as soon as possible.

1208
00:57:24,707 --> 00:57:26,247
I got all their documentation.

1209
00:57:26,342 --> 00:57:27,212
And?

1210
00:57:27,310 --> 00:57:29,410
And they have
been very thorough.

1211
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:34,622
To be blunt, I don't
see any way of shaking

1212
00:57:34,717 --> 00:57:35,917
their sleepwalking defense.

1213
00:57:36,019 --> 00:57:38,389
What?

1214
00:57:38,488 --> 00:57:41,958
Dr. O'Brien, you think that
he drove over to his in-laws,

1215
00:57:42,058 --> 00:57:44,698
killed someone, cut his hands
to the bone in his sleep?

1216
00:57:44,794 --> 00:57:45,594
I know.

1217
00:57:45,695 --> 00:57:46,695
It sounds incredible.

1218
00:57:46,796 --> 00:57:48,436
And they may well
have a difficult time

1219
00:57:48,531 --> 00:57:50,331
convincing a jury, but
I believe it's true.

1220
00:57:50,433 --> 00:57:51,233
Wait a minute.

1221
00:57:51,334 --> 00:57:52,504
What's the difference?

1222
00:57:52,602 --> 00:57:54,102
He was dreaming about
killing his mother-in-law,

1223
00:57:54,204 --> 00:57:55,004
and what do you know?

1224
00:57:55,104 --> 00:57:56,274
He acted out his dream.

1225
00:57:56,372 --> 00:57:58,272
That's a common
misunderstanding, Detective.

1226
00:57:58,374 --> 00:58:00,344
Sleepwalkers are not dreaming.

1227
00:58:00,443 --> 00:58:03,243
In fact, they're not
thinking anything at all.

1228
00:58:03,346 --> 00:58:07,016
Their brains are actually
in a short-term coma.

1229
00:58:07,116 --> 00:58:09,016
That's why they never
remember anything.

1230
00:58:11,955 --> 00:58:14,195
I'll get you my report
first thing tomorrow.

1231
00:58:14,290 --> 00:58:15,190
Thanks, Doctor.

1232
00:58:21,598 --> 00:58:23,438
[sighs]

1233
00:58:23,533 --> 00:58:24,933
What if he was sleepwalking?

1234
00:58:28,404 --> 00:58:32,844
He drove 14 miles and
deliberately took a tire iron

1235
00:58:32,942 --> 00:58:34,942
into the house with him, got
a knife from the kitchen,

1236
00:58:35,044 --> 00:58:37,044
took the phone off the hook
so no one would call for help,

1237
00:58:37,146 --> 00:58:41,456
and then he viciously
attacked two people.

1238
00:58:41,551 --> 00:58:45,251
He's a liar, and he's
a cold-blooded killer.

1239
00:58:45,355 --> 00:58:46,225
You're right.

1240
00:58:46,322 --> 00:58:49,392
He knew what he was doing.

1241
00:58:49,492 --> 00:58:50,392
Ah.

1242
00:58:55,331 --> 00:58:57,831
We'll start with the forensic
experts and the doctors.

1243
00:58:57,934 --> 00:59:00,004
And then after that, the
investigating officers--

1244
00:59:00,069 --> 00:59:01,139
Hi.

1245
00:59:01,237 --> 00:59:02,807
Sorry I'm late.

1246
00:59:02,906 --> 00:59:03,706
MARY ELLEN: It's OK.

1247
00:59:03,806 --> 00:59:04,846
We're just getting started.

1248
00:59:04,941 --> 00:59:09,011
Now, I should warn you
that Mark's lawyers are

1249
00:59:09,112 --> 00:59:11,252
going to argue that
he was sleepwalking

1250
00:59:11,347 --> 00:59:12,587
when he committed the crime.

1251
00:59:12,682 --> 00:59:13,582
Sleepwalking?

1252
00:59:13,683 --> 00:59:14,553
Oh, come on.

1253
00:59:14,651 --> 00:59:15,951
They must think
we're pretty stupid.

1254
00:59:16,052 --> 00:59:19,192
What, he ran around our house
attacking our parents asleep?

1255
00:59:19,289 --> 00:59:20,319
Did you know about this?

1256
00:59:23,993 --> 00:59:26,993
You believed it?

1257
00:59:27,096 --> 00:59:29,596
I don't know, but
it seems possible.

1258
00:59:29,699 --> 00:59:31,399
Well, to be honest,
Lauren, I don't

1259
00:59:31,501 --> 00:59:33,271
think that it is possible.

1260
00:59:33,369 --> 00:59:35,639
And I intend to argue
that during the trial.

1261
00:59:35,738 --> 00:59:37,408
Now, there is one fact
that no one disputes,

1262
00:59:37,507 --> 00:59:39,247
and that is that Mark
planned to go to your parents

1263
00:59:39,342 --> 00:59:42,112
and confess his gambling losses.

1264
00:59:42,211 --> 00:59:44,551
And as you know, legally,
you don't have to testify

1265
00:59:44,647 --> 00:59:46,447
against your husband.

1266
00:59:46,549 --> 00:59:47,819
But--

1267
00:59:47,917 --> 00:59:50,457
We just want the jury to hear
the whole story, that's all,

1268
00:59:50,553 --> 00:59:52,753
so they can make a decision
knowing all the facts.

1269
00:59:57,627 --> 00:59:59,827
I can't, Dad.

1270
00:59:59,929 --> 01:00:01,429
TANYA: Lauren, what about Mom?

1271
01:00:01,531 --> 01:00:04,731
Can't you do this
one thing for Mom?

1272
01:00:04,834 --> 01:00:06,174
MARY ELLEN: Lauren,
your father told me how

1273
01:00:06,269 --> 01:00:07,939
close you were to your mother.

1274
01:00:08,037 --> 01:00:10,377
I know you must want
to see justice done.

1275
01:00:10,473 --> 01:00:13,043
All I'm asking you to
do is tell the truth.

1276
01:00:13,142 --> 01:00:15,282
Don't you think you owe
that to your mother?

1277
01:00:15,378 --> 01:00:18,548
I owe my mother more
than I can ever repay.

1278
01:00:18,648 --> 01:00:20,918
But if I testify against
Mark, the jury will

1279
01:00:21,017 --> 01:00:22,417
think I believe he's guilty.

1280
01:00:22,518 --> 01:00:25,158
And I don't know.

1281
01:00:25,254 --> 01:00:26,154
I just don't know.

1282
01:00:35,999 --> 01:00:39,999
BROOKE: Mark Schall had no
motive for killing Anne Lane.

1283
01:00:40,103 --> 01:00:43,703
In fact, as numerous
witnesses will testify,

1284
01:00:43,806 --> 01:00:46,806
Mark and his mother-in-law
shared a warm, affectionate

1285
01:00:46,909 --> 01:00:48,379
relationship.

1286
01:00:48,478 --> 01:00:51,348
Mark Schall had no
history of violence.

1287
01:00:51,447 --> 01:00:53,517
And as many doctors
will testify,

1288
01:00:53,616 --> 01:00:57,756
he has no mental or
physical illness.

1289
01:00:57,854 --> 01:01:02,524
Why then did this tragedy occur?

1290
01:01:02,625 --> 01:01:07,095
We will prove that there is
only one possible explanation.

1291
01:01:07,196 --> 01:01:11,966
On the night of May 23, Mark
Schall was sleepwalking.

1292
01:01:15,104 --> 01:01:17,904
I clocked the distance between
the Schall and Lane residences

1293
01:01:18,007 --> 01:01:20,347
at 14.1 miles.

1294
01:01:20,443 --> 01:01:24,083
Now, driving the route
involved making six turns

1295
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:29,350
and observing two stop
signs and 14 traffic lights.

1296
01:01:29,452 --> 01:01:30,352
Thank you, Detective.

1297
01:01:30,453 --> 01:01:31,653
You can resume
the witness stand.

1298
01:01:35,191 --> 01:01:39,161
Can you tell us how Mark
Schall got into the Lane house?

1299
01:01:39,262 --> 01:01:40,332
He had a key.

1300
01:01:40,430 --> 01:01:42,930
And by using that key,
it was possible for him

1301
01:01:43,032 --> 01:01:44,732
to gain surreptitious entry?

1302
01:01:44,834 --> 01:01:45,934
That's correct.

1303
01:01:46,035 --> 01:01:48,675
Which gave him the element
of surprise in attacking

1304
01:01:48,771 --> 01:01:49,941
Anne and Roth Lane.

1305
01:01:50,039 --> 01:01:51,509
Yes, I would say so.

1306
01:01:51,607 --> 01:01:53,407
Thank you.

1307
01:01:53,509 --> 01:01:55,849
The key to the Lane house.

1308
01:01:55,945 --> 01:01:57,885
I presume you dusted
it for fingerprints.

1309
01:01:57,980 --> 01:01:59,780
We tried, but it
was quite smudged.

1310
01:01:59,882 --> 01:02:01,552
A number of people
had handled it.

1311
01:02:01,651 --> 01:02:03,351
So it's possible
then that Mark

1312
01:02:03,453 --> 01:02:05,493
Schall actually
rang the doorbell

1313
01:02:05,588 --> 01:02:08,388
and that Anne Lane let him in.

1314
01:02:08,491 --> 01:02:09,731
It's possible.

1315
01:02:09,826 --> 01:02:12,266
You also testified that you
believe that Mark purposely

1316
01:02:12,361 --> 01:02:14,431
removed the kitchen
phone from the hook

1317
01:02:14,530 --> 01:02:17,670
to prevent anyone
from calling 911.

1318
01:02:17,767 --> 01:02:20,367
I presume you dusted the
receiver for fingerprints.

1319
01:02:20,470 --> 01:02:21,440
No.

1320
01:02:21,537 --> 01:02:22,977
I instructed the
criminologist to do that,

1321
01:02:23,072 --> 01:02:24,942
but it just fell
through the cracks.

1322
01:02:25,041 --> 01:02:26,611
Oh.

1323
01:02:26,709 --> 01:02:29,809
Counselor, the fact is
we already had a confession

1324
01:02:29,912 --> 01:02:31,852
and conclusive
evidence identifying

1325
01:02:31,948 --> 01:02:33,448
the defendant as the killer.

1326
01:02:33,549 --> 01:02:36,449
But it is possible that Anne
tried to use the phone to call

1327
01:02:36,552 --> 01:02:39,752
for help, but that the extension
phone in the first-floor

1328
01:02:39,856 --> 01:02:42,926
bedroom had already been
knocked off the hook during

1329
01:02:43,025 --> 01:02:44,765
Roth's struggle
with Mark and that

1330
01:02:44,861 --> 01:02:47,231
she could not get a dial tone?

1331
01:02:47,330 --> 01:02:48,970
That's a lot of
assumptions, Counselor.

1332
01:02:49,065 --> 01:02:50,765
Is it possible, Detective?

1333
01:02:50,867 --> 01:02:53,807
Yes, it's possible.

1334
01:02:53,903 --> 01:02:56,103
You said you were in
your bedroom that night

1335
01:02:56,205 --> 01:03:00,515
and that you heard
Mark pacing outside.

1336
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:04,010
Yeah, I think he came there
to kill Christopher and me.

1337
01:03:04,113 --> 01:03:05,883
Was the bedroom door locked?

1338
01:03:05,982 --> 01:03:06,952
No.

1339
01:03:07,049 --> 01:03:08,789
There are no locks
on our bedroom doors.

1340
01:03:08,885 --> 01:03:11,655
So there was nothing
stopping him from coming in?

1341
01:03:11,754 --> 01:03:12,994
Well, no, but--

1342
01:03:13,089 --> 01:03:15,189
In fact, in the five years
that you've known Mark Schall,

1343
01:03:15,291 --> 01:03:17,561
have you ever seen
him act violently?

1344
01:03:21,063 --> 01:03:23,463
No.

1345
01:03:23,566 --> 01:03:28,936
But he was making
these scary noises.

1346
01:03:29,038 --> 01:03:30,478
Scary noises?

1347
01:03:30,573 --> 01:03:32,473
Yeah, kind of like grunting.

1348
01:03:32,575 --> 01:03:33,475
BROOKE: Grunting?

1349
01:03:36,279 --> 01:03:38,249
TANYA: Yes, he was
grunting like an animal.

1350
01:03:41,017 --> 01:03:42,417
It was very frightening.

1351
01:03:49,892 --> 01:03:51,332
Eileen.

1352
01:03:51,427 --> 01:03:53,767
Hello, Lauren.

1353
01:03:53,863 --> 01:03:56,733
I said some awful things
to you at the diner.

1354
01:03:56,833 --> 01:03:58,733
I hope you can forgive me.

1355
01:03:58,835 --> 01:04:00,265
Well, this has been
hard on all of us,

1356
01:04:00,369 --> 01:04:03,939
but hardest of all
on you, I'm sure.

1357
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:06,180
I believe Mark.

1358
01:04:06,275 --> 01:04:07,745
I believe he was sleepwalking.

1359
01:04:07,844 --> 01:04:10,084
What Tanya said about
the grunting noises

1360
01:04:10,179 --> 01:04:12,279
he made, it was exactly like
when your husband sleptwalk,

1361
01:04:12,381 --> 01:04:13,281
wasn't it?

1362
01:04:19,889 --> 01:04:22,429
[chuckles] I had a dream
about you too last night.

1363
01:04:22,525 --> 01:04:23,325
INMATE 1: Come on, man.

1364
01:04:23,426 --> 01:04:25,126
I got to arrange bail.

1365
01:04:25,228 --> 01:04:26,498
Yeah, no, for real.

1366
01:04:26,596 --> 01:04:28,966
INMATE 1: Listen, if I don't
call in the next five minutes,

1367
01:04:29,065 --> 01:04:31,135
I'm going to be stuck
in here the whole night.

1368
01:04:31,234 --> 01:04:34,404
INMATE 2: Get out
of my face now.

1369
01:04:34,503 --> 01:04:35,303
INMATE 1: Please.

1370
01:04:35,404 --> 01:04:36,304
INMATE 2: Shut up!

1371
01:04:39,075 --> 01:04:40,675
Let him use the damn phone.

1372
01:04:40,776 --> 01:04:41,976
Get out of my way.

1373
01:04:42,078 --> 01:04:43,278
- Come on, man.
- Hey.

1374
01:04:43,379 --> 01:04:44,509
- Hey, hey.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1375
01:04:44,614 --> 01:04:46,514
[grunting]

1376
01:04:46,616 --> 01:04:47,916
[groans]

1377
01:04:49,652 --> 01:04:53,092
[breathes heavily]

1378
01:04:57,026 --> 01:05:00,366
[somber instrumental music]

1379
01:05:01,464 --> 01:05:04,064
BROOKE: Mark, is it true
that you stole money

1380
01:05:04,166 --> 01:05:08,276
from your wife's savings account
and from your employer, money

1381
01:05:08,371 --> 01:05:12,011
which you subsequently
lost at the racetrack?

1382
01:05:12,108 --> 01:05:13,078
Yes.

1383
01:05:13,175 --> 01:05:15,875
Why did you do that?

1384
01:05:15,978 --> 01:05:19,478
About a year ago,
I went to the track

1385
01:05:19,582 --> 01:05:21,982
with some buddies of
mine, and I got lucky.

1386
01:05:22,084 --> 01:05:25,284
And I picked a winner
on my first bet,

1387
01:05:25,388 --> 01:05:26,858
only I didn't think
that it was luck.

1388
01:05:26,956 --> 01:05:33,066
I thought that I had some
kind of special knack.

1389
01:05:33,162 --> 01:05:35,662
But I didn't.

1390
01:05:35,765 --> 01:05:39,165
So I just kept betting to
try to win back the money

1391
01:05:39,268 --> 01:05:41,908
that I had lost.

1392
01:05:42,004 --> 01:05:43,144
I never did.

1393
01:05:43,239 --> 01:05:45,739
BROOKE: Was your wife
angry when she found out?

1394
01:05:45,841 --> 01:05:46,641
MARK: Yes.

1395
01:05:46,742 --> 01:05:48,942
I thought she might leave me.

1396
01:05:49,045 --> 01:05:51,115
She yelled and
screamed at you?

1397
01:05:51,213 --> 01:05:52,013
Yes.

1398
01:05:52,114 --> 01:05:54,184
So you had violent arguments?

1399
01:05:54,283 --> 01:05:56,623
Well, there wasn't
really any arguing, really.

1400
01:05:56,719 --> 01:06:00,019
It was just mostly
Lauren yelling at me.

1401
01:06:00,089 --> 01:06:01,329
BROOKE: Did it make you mad?

1402
01:06:01,424 --> 01:06:02,964
No, no.

1403
01:06:03,059 --> 01:06:04,899
I deserved it.

1404
01:06:04,994 --> 01:06:07,194
Boy, you must have felt
like fighting back a little.

1405
01:06:07,296 --> 01:06:09,096
I know when someone
yells and screams at me,

1406
01:06:09,198 --> 01:06:11,398
I even get the urge once
in a while to sock them.

1407
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:13,640
I would never hit Lauren.

1408
01:06:13,736 --> 01:06:15,236
Never?

1409
01:06:15,338 --> 01:06:17,838
You never raised your hand to
your wife not once in the three

1410
01:06:17,940 --> 01:06:19,210
years that you were married?

1411
01:06:19,308 --> 01:06:20,478
No.

1412
01:06:20,576 --> 01:06:22,776
OK.

1413
01:06:22,878 --> 01:06:24,248
Your sister-in-law
told the court

1414
01:06:24,347 --> 01:06:26,117
that on the night
that Anne died,

1415
01:06:26,215 --> 01:06:29,115
you paced outside the
upstairs bedrooms, grunting.

1416
01:06:29,218 --> 01:06:31,218
Do you recall that?

1417
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:32,460
Just a little.

1418
01:06:32,555 --> 01:06:35,695
And I had this feeling that
the kids were in danger.

1419
01:06:35,791 --> 01:06:37,461
So I went running up there.

1420
01:06:37,560 --> 01:06:41,500
And I thought that I was
yelling or calling out to him.

1421
01:06:41,597 --> 01:06:43,597
I thought I was
saying, kids, kids.

1422
01:06:43,699 --> 01:06:47,099
Mark, did you care about
your mother-in-law, Anne Lane?

1423
01:06:47,203 --> 01:06:50,043
Yes, very much.

1424
01:06:50,139 --> 01:06:54,079
Would you have ever
consciously harmed her?

1425
01:06:54,176 --> 01:06:58,176
No, never.

1426
01:06:58,280 --> 01:07:01,180
You never hit your wife?

1427
01:07:01,283 --> 01:07:02,553
No.

1428
01:07:02,651 --> 01:07:03,921
You never hit
your mother-in-law?

1429
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:04,920
No.

1430
01:07:05,021 --> 01:07:08,391
So your testimony
before this court

1431
01:07:08,491 --> 01:07:11,731
is that you're a
nonviolent person.

1432
01:07:11,827 --> 01:07:13,527

1433
01:07:13,629 --> 01:07:16,699

named Judd Brazil?

He's a-- he's an inmate on
my tier at the county jail.

1435
01:07:20,770 --> 01:07:23,240
Two nights ago,
did you attack him?

1436
01:07:23,339 --> 01:07:24,239
MARK: This kid needed to use--

1437
01:07:24,340 --> 01:07:27,210
Did you attack him, yes or no?

1438
01:07:27,309 --> 01:07:28,909
Yes, we got in a fight.

him against a wall,

that required three stitches.

1441
01:07:34,250 --> 01:07:35,990
Yes.

Going back to the
night of May 23,

1443
01:07:38,454 --> 01:07:40,654
you say that you don't
remember trying to choke

1444
01:07:40,756 --> 01:07:42,226
your father-in-law to death?

1445
01:07:42,324 --> 01:07:43,124
No.

1446
01:07:43,225 --> 01:07:44,865
Stabbing him five times?

1447
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:46,230
No.

1448
01:07:46,328 --> 01:07:47,928
You don't remember stabbing
your mother-in-law five times?

1449
01:07:48,030 --> 01:07:48,930
No.

1450
01:07:49,031 --> 01:07:52,201
Or breaking her
skull with a tire iron?

1451
01:07:52,301 --> 01:07:53,471
No.

1452
01:07:53,569 --> 01:07:56,309

Dr. Corrigan, does a
person who's sleepwalking

1498
01:10:34,630 --> 01:10:36,330
have any control
over what he does?

1499
01:10:36,432 --> 01:10:38,102
No, none whatsoever.

1500
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:41,400
A person who is sleepwalking
is very much like a car

1501
01:10:41,503 --> 01:10:43,243
operating without a driver.

1502
01:10:43,339 --> 01:10:46,109
So if a sleepwalker
does not want

1503
01:10:46,208 --> 01:10:50,108
to do something, attack
someone, for instance,

1504
01:10:50,212 --> 01:10:52,352
would he be able
to stop himself?

1505
01:10:52,448 --> 01:10:53,618
DR. CORRIGAN: No, he would not.

1506
01:10:53,716 --> 01:10:56,916
He simply has no awareness
of what he is doing.

1507
01:10:57,019 --> 01:10:58,859
He's more or less blacked out.

1508
01:10:58,954 --> 01:11:01,654
Is such a person doomed
to be a danger to society?

1509
01:11:01,757 --> 01:11:03,027
No, not at all.

1510
01:11:03,125 --> 01:11:06,325
With the right medication and
a prescribed sleep regimen,

1511
01:11:06,428 --> 01:11:09,798
he could lead a
completely normal life.

1512
01:11:09,898 --> 01:11:12,698
Doctor, how is it
possible that Mark

1513
01:11:12,801 --> 01:11:16,941
Schall was able to drive his
car 14 miles in his sleep?

1514
01:11:17,039 --> 01:11:20,279
Sleepwalkers tend to
repeat familiar actions.

1515
01:11:20,376 --> 01:11:23,376
Now, it's my understanding
that Mark had driven

1516
01:11:23,479 --> 01:11:25,779
the same route over 100 times.

1517
01:11:25,881 --> 01:11:29,381
But turns, stop
signs, traffic lights.

1518
01:11:29,485 --> 01:11:31,855
It's like a person
who commutes to work.

1519
01:11:31,954 --> 01:11:34,194
Most days, he can't
even remember the trip.

1520
01:11:34,290 --> 01:11:35,820
It just becomes
automatic behavior.

1521
01:11:35,924 --> 01:11:40,064
Doctor, based on your
examination of Mark Schall,

1522
01:11:40,162 --> 01:11:41,932
do you believe that
he was sleepwalking

1523
01:11:42,031 --> 01:11:44,001
on the night of May 23?

1524
01:11:44,099 --> 01:11:45,869
Yes, I do.

1525
01:11:45,968 --> 01:11:47,838
Thank you.

1526
01:11:47,936 --> 01:11:49,776
Have you ever personally
witnessed a sleepwalker

1527
01:11:49,872 --> 01:11:51,412
in an aggressive state?

1528
01:11:51,507 --> 01:11:53,907
Personally, no, but
I have presided over--

1529
01:11:54,009 --> 01:11:55,779
A yes or no will
be sufficient.

1530
01:11:55,878 --> 01:11:56,678
No.

1531
01:11:56,779 --> 01:11:58,279
No, I haven't.

1532
01:11:58,380 --> 01:12:01,380
It's possible, is it not,
for a sleepwalker to act

1533
01:12:01,483 --> 01:12:05,823
on some unconscious desire?

1534
01:12:05,921 --> 01:12:07,491
I'm not sure what you mean.

1535
01:12:07,589 --> 01:12:09,389
Say Mark Schall had
a deep-seated desire

1536
01:12:09,491 --> 01:12:10,791
to kill his mother-in-law.

1537
01:12:10,893 --> 01:12:14,093
Is it possible he was acting on
that desire while sleepwalking?

1538
01:12:14,196 --> 01:12:16,336
Well, here, again, you
have many instances--

1539
01:12:16,432 --> 01:12:18,632
Doctor, we don't need anything
more than a yes or a no.

1540
01:12:18,734 --> 01:12:20,434
Is it possible that
Mark Schall was

1541
01:12:20,536 --> 01:12:23,906
acting on a deep-seated desire
when he killed Anne Lane?

1542
01:12:24,006 --> 01:12:27,376
Yes, theoretically, I
suppose it's possible.

1543
01:12:27,476 --> 01:12:28,816
On the other
hand, sleepwalkers

1544
01:12:28,911 --> 01:12:31,511
cannot do all the things that
an awake, aware person can do.

1545
01:12:31,613 --> 01:12:32,453
Isn't that true?

1546
01:12:32,548 --> 01:12:34,488
Yes, there are
many higher-order

1547
01:12:34,583 --> 01:12:37,283
activities that sleepwalkers
would be incapable of.

1548
01:12:37,386 --> 01:12:38,786
Aiming a gun, for instance?

1549
01:12:38,887 --> 01:12:39,857
Unlikely.

1550
01:12:39,955 --> 01:12:41,655
They tend to show very
poor coordination.

1551
01:12:41,757 --> 01:12:42,987
Chasing a moving object?

1552
01:12:43,092 --> 01:12:44,122
Probably not.

1553
01:12:44,226 --> 01:12:46,566
Like someone trying to
escape from an attacker?

1554
01:12:46,662 --> 01:12:47,832
No, I didn't mean to suggest--

1555
01:12:47,930 --> 01:12:49,200
Please answer the question.

1556
01:12:49,298 --> 01:12:51,038
Yes or no, is it possible?

1557
01:12:51,133 --> 01:12:51,933
No.

1558
01:12:52,034 --> 01:12:52,834
No?

1559
01:12:52,935 --> 01:12:54,105
No what, no?

1560
01:12:54,203 --> 01:12:56,373
No, a sleepwalker cannot
pursue a victim the way we know

1561
01:12:56,472 --> 01:12:57,872
Mark Schall pursued Anne Lane?

1562
01:12:57,973 --> 01:12:58,773
No.

1563
01:12:58,874 --> 01:13:00,614
I mean, yes.

1564
01:13:00,709 --> 01:13:03,049
I believe he was
capable of pursuing her.

1565
01:13:03,145 --> 01:13:04,645
First, it's no, then it's yes.

1566
01:13:04,747 --> 01:13:05,517
Which is it, Doctor?

1567
01:13:05,614 --> 01:13:06,414
Your honor.

1568
01:13:06,515 --> 01:13:08,985
Question withdrawn.

1569
01:13:09,084 --> 01:13:11,224
You've testified that one of
the reasons that you believe

1570
01:13:11,320 --> 01:13:13,720
Mark Schall was sleepwalking
is that he has no memories

1571
01:13:13,822 --> 01:13:15,862
of the events of May 23.

1572
01:13:15,958 --> 01:13:16,858
That's correct.

1573
01:13:16,959 --> 01:13:18,399
Are you saying
then that there is no

1574
01:13:18,494 --> 01:13:20,794
possibility that he recalls
stabbing and bludgeoning

1575
01:13:20,896 --> 01:13:21,796
his mother-in-law?

1576
01:13:21,897 --> 01:13:23,137
I have no evidence
that he recalls--

1577
01:13:23,232 --> 01:13:25,672
Just answer the
question, yes or no.

1578
01:13:29,204 --> 01:13:34,244
Um-- yes, it's possible
that he remembers.

1579
01:13:34,343 --> 01:13:36,583
So let me get this
straight, Doctor.

1580
01:13:36,678 --> 01:13:39,148
One of the reasons you
believe that Mark Schall was

1581
01:13:39,248 --> 01:13:41,348
sleepwalking is
that he says he has

1582
01:13:41,450 --> 01:13:43,690
no memories of those
events, and now you

1583
01:13:43,786 --> 01:13:45,686
admit that it's possible
that he does remember

1584
01:13:45,788 --> 01:13:47,158
and he's simply lying.

1585
01:13:47,256 --> 01:13:48,326
Have I got that right?

1586
01:13:51,627 --> 01:13:52,797
Yes.

1587
01:13:52,895 --> 01:13:53,795

Yes, Christopher, I did.

01:14:13,215 --> 01:14:15,455
Did you offer to
testify for him?

1594
01:14:15,551 --> 01:14:17,391
The subject didn't come up.

1595

Well, we just think you
should know that if you do,

1596
01:14:20,522 --> 01:14:23,692
you're not our sister anymore.

MAN (ON SPEAKER):
Ms. McAdam, Lauren

1602
01:14:44,746 --> 01:14:45,916
Schall is here to see you.

1603
01:14:54,756 --> 01:14:55,556
Hi.

1604
01:14:55,657 --> 01:14:57,657
Hi.

1605
01:14:57,759 --> 01:14:58,799
Please come in.

1606
01:15:02,931 --> 01:15:07,741
I've been walking
around, trying to think.

1607
01:15:07,836 --> 01:15:11,536
Do you think the jury is
going to convict Mark?

1608
01:15:11,640 --> 01:15:12,610
I think they might.

1609
01:15:15,744 --> 01:15:20,354
Mark made me promise not
to ask you to testify.

1610
01:15:20,449 --> 01:15:21,349
You don't have to.

1611
01:15:24,419 --> 01:15:25,559
Good night.

Dad.

1615
01:15:40,035 --> 01:15:40,835
Go ahead.

1616
01:15:40,936 --> 01:15:43,906
I'll be right there.

1617
01:15:44,006 --> 01:15:45,276
Hi.

1618
01:15:45,374 --> 01:15:47,114
Hi.

1619
01:15:47,209 --> 01:15:49,609
How are you?

1620
01:15:49,711 --> 01:15:52,081
Getting through it.

1621
01:15:52,180 --> 01:15:53,520
Yeah.

1622
01:15:53,615 --> 01:15:57,285
You know, part of
me has wanted so badly

1623
01:15:57,386 --> 01:16:00,456
to blame Mark for Mom's death.

1624
01:16:00,556 --> 01:16:03,826
Hate him for it because
it hurt so much.

1625
01:16:03,926 --> 01:16:05,866
But you and Mom always
told me the only way

1626
01:16:05,961 --> 01:16:09,561
to live in the world
is to live in truth.

1627
01:16:09,665 --> 01:16:13,235
And Dad, the truth is I
can't blame him anymore.

1628
01:16:13,335 --> 01:16:16,135
In my heart, I just can't.

1629
01:16:16,238 --> 01:16:17,138
He needs me now.

1630
01:16:20,175 --> 01:16:25,315
I know that if I testify
for him, I may lose you.

1631
01:16:25,414 --> 01:16:26,544
I may lose all the family.

1632
01:16:26,648 --> 01:16:28,748
But if I don't, Mark
may lose his life.

1633
01:16:39,628 --> 01:16:41,968
Your honor, the defense
calls its last witness,

1634
01:16:42,064 --> 01:16:42,964
Lauren Schall.

1635
01:16:48,770 --> 01:16:52,670
Lauren, when Mark went out
on the night of May 23,

1636
01:16:52,774 --> 01:16:55,614
he left the front door of
your house standing open.

1637
01:16:55,711 --> 01:16:57,181
In the three years
of your marriage,

1638
01:16:57,279 --> 01:16:58,449
had he ever done that before?

1639
01:16:58,547 --> 01:16:59,577
Never.

1640
01:16:59,681 --> 01:17:01,081
BROOKE: When he arrived
at your parents' house,

1641
01:17:01,183 --> 01:17:03,353
he parked in a
neighbor's driveway.

1642
01:17:03,452 --> 01:17:05,192
Had the two of you
ever done that before?

1643
01:17:05,287 --> 01:17:07,327
Yes, often.

1644
01:17:07,422 --> 01:17:10,092
They're an elderly couple,
and they don't have a car,

1645
01:17:10,192 --> 01:17:12,432
so they told us to feel free
to park there any time there

1646
01:17:12,527 --> 01:17:13,667
wasn't room at my parents'.

1647
01:17:13,762 --> 01:17:15,702
BROOKE: A tire iron
from Mark's car

1648
01:17:15,797 --> 01:17:20,207
was also used in the assault. Do
you have any idea why he might

1649
01:17:20,302 --> 01:17:22,102
have taken that into the house?

1650
01:17:22,204 --> 01:17:25,344
He used it a few months
ago to fix a heat register

1651
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:27,680
at my mom and dad's place.

1652
01:17:27,776 --> 01:17:30,076
The only thing I can think
is in his sleepwalking mind,

1653
01:17:30,178 --> 01:17:30,978
he thought--

1654
01:17:31,079 --> 01:17:32,019
Objection, your honor.

1655
01:17:32,114 --> 01:17:33,544
Mrs. Schall can't
possibly know what

1656
01:17:33,649 --> 01:17:35,219
was in the defendant's mind.

1657
01:17:35,317 --> 01:17:36,717
Sustained.

1658
01:17:36,818 --> 01:17:39,088
The jury will disregard
the witness' speculation.

1659
01:17:39,187 --> 01:17:43,427
Lauren, can you think of
any reason whatever Mark might

1660
01:17:43,525 --> 01:17:45,865
have had to harm your mother?

1661
01:17:45,961 --> 01:17:50,201
I've gone over and
over that in my mind.

1662
01:17:50,298 --> 01:17:53,338
When I was in high school, I
had a big fight with my mom

1663
01:17:53,435 --> 01:17:55,305
and dad, and I moved out.

1664
01:17:55,404 --> 01:17:56,734
It was Mark who made
me see that they

1665
01:17:56,838 --> 01:17:58,678
truly loved me and
were just doing what

1666
01:17:58,774 --> 01:18:02,214
they thought was best for me.

1667
01:18:02,310 --> 01:18:04,380
My mom never forgot that.

1668
01:18:04,479 --> 01:18:09,119
From that time on, she loved
him like he was her own son.

1669
01:18:09,217 --> 01:18:12,587
And I know he felt the same
way and would never have hurt

1670
01:18:12,688 --> 01:18:13,818
her if he could have helped it.

1671
01:18:17,426 --> 01:18:18,326
Thank you.

1672
01:18:21,096 --> 01:18:23,036
Mrs. Schall, regarding
the fraud connected

1673
01:18:23,131 --> 01:18:24,731
to the defendant's
gambling losses,

1674
01:18:24,833 --> 01:18:27,103
this went on for some months
without your knowledge,

1675
01:18:27,202 --> 01:18:28,002
did it not?

1676
01:18:28,103 --> 01:18:29,373
Yes.

1677
01:18:29,471 --> 01:18:31,441
So your husband was able to
hide serious criminal behavior

1678
01:18:31,540 --> 01:18:33,180
from you?

1679
01:18:33,275 --> 01:18:34,175
I guess.

1680
01:18:34,276 --> 01:18:36,376
Did he lie to you
during that period

1681
01:18:36,478 --> 01:18:37,918
about what he was
doing evenings,

1682
01:18:38,013 --> 01:18:41,013
about savings
account withdrawals?

1683
01:18:41,116 --> 01:18:42,086
Yes.

1684
01:18:42,184 --> 01:18:43,784
MARY ELLEN: And you
believed those lies?

1685
01:18:43,885 --> 01:18:45,085
Yeah.

1686
01:18:45,187 --> 01:18:46,557
Just like you believe him
now when he says he doesn't

1687
01:18:46,655 --> 01:18:47,855
remember murdering your mother?

1688
01:18:47,956 --> 01:18:49,026
LAUREN: It's not the same.

1689
01:18:49,124 --> 01:18:50,424
MARY ELLEN: Isn't it?

1690
01:18:50,525 --> 01:18:53,565
He committed a crime, he lied
to you, and you believed him.

1691
01:18:53,662 --> 01:18:55,302
The only difference now
is that it's not fraud.

1692
01:18:55,397 --> 01:18:56,197
It's murder.

1693
01:18:56,298 --> 01:18:57,098
Isn't that right?

1694
01:18:57,199 --> 01:18:58,869
No.

1695
01:18:58,967 --> 01:19:03,107
Mrs. Schall, the
night of the murder,

1696
01:19:03,205 --> 01:19:05,645
you asked your husband
back to bed with you?

1697
01:19:05,741 --> 01:19:06,541
That's true.

1698
01:19:06,641 --> 01:19:08,481
MARY ELLEN: But he refused?

1699
01:19:08,577 --> 01:19:09,377
Well, he said--

1700
01:19:09,478 --> 01:19:10,948
He refused, didn't he?

1701
01:19:11,046 --> 01:19:12,686
Which is strange,
isn't it, because you

1702
01:19:12,781 --> 01:19:15,351
had been angry with him for
days over the gambling losses.

1703
01:19:15,450 --> 01:19:17,720
And he was sleeping on the
living room sofa in part

1704
01:19:17,819 --> 01:19:21,219
because you didn't want him
in your bed, isn't that right?

1705
01:19:21,323 --> 01:19:22,553
Yes.

1706
01:19:22,657 --> 01:19:25,227
So you finally invite him
back to bed, a wife's last act

1707
01:19:25,327 --> 01:19:27,597
of forgiveness, and he refused?

1708
01:19:27,696 --> 01:19:28,866
Is that so that
he could sneak out

1709
01:19:28,964 --> 01:19:29,864
later and murder your mother?

1710
01:19:29,965 --> 01:19:30,865
Your honor.

1711
01:19:30,966 --> 01:19:32,336
No.

1712
01:19:32,434 --> 01:19:35,474
I said, you can come to bed
if you want, and he said no.

1713
01:19:35,570 --> 01:19:37,870
He said, not until I get
back on the right track,

1714
01:19:37,973 --> 01:19:40,043
not until you can
trust me again.

1715
01:19:40,142 --> 01:19:42,012
There was no secret plan.

1716
01:19:42,110 --> 01:19:44,650
He was simply
ashamed of himself,

1717
01:19:44,746 --> 01:19:46,986
and he didn't think he
deserved my forgiveness.

1718
01:19:47,082 --> 01:19:49,782
That's why he didn't come to
bed that night because that's

1719
01:19:49,885 --> 01:19:52,385
the kind of person he is.

1720
01:19:52,487 --> 01:19:53,827
He has a conscience,
and he cares.

1721
01:19:53,922 --> 01:19:56,992
And that's how I know deep
down he would never ever

1722
01:19:57,092 --> 01:19:59,862
have hurt my mom on purpose.

1723
01:19:59,961 --> 01:20:01,101
He knows how much
I loved her, and he

1724
01:20:01,196 --> 01:20:02,426
would have never
taken her away from me

1725
01:20:02,531 --> 01:20:03,331
if he could have helped it.

1726
01:20:03,431 --> 01:20:06,901
[music playing]

1727
01:20:09,905 --> 01:20:12,475
Is it not simply unbelievable
that the accused could

1728
01:20:12,574 --> 01:20:14,074
have done everything
that he did the night

1729
01:20:14,176 --> 01:20:16,546
in question in his sleep?

1730
01:20:16,645 --> 01:20:18,745
Yes, people do sleepwalk,
but when they do,

1731
01:20:18,847 --> 01:20:22,047
they usually engage in
familiar patterns of behavior.

1732
01:20:22,150 --> 01:20:26,490
But what was familiar about
trying to kill two people?

1733
01:20:26,588 --> 01:20:29,158
Yes, sleepwalkers are known
to react violently when

1734
01:20:29,257 --> 01:20:31,397
someone tries to wake them.

1735
01:20:31,493 --> 01:20:34,193
But Mark Schall did not simply
strike out at the first person

1736
01:20:34,296 --> 01:20:35,396
who shook him.

1737
01:20:35,497 --> 01:20:37,667
He pursued his victims in
a sustained attack that

1738
01:20:37,766 --> 01:20:40,836
probably lasted many minutes.

1739
01:20:40,936 --> 01:20:44,606
But there's really only one
thing you need to remember,

1740
01:20:44,706 --> 01:20:49,446
and that is that Mark
Schall took this tire iron

1741
01:20:49,544 --> 01:20:51,344
from his car into
the house, where

1742
01:20:51,446 --> 01:20:55,716
he used it to viciously and with
premeditation kill Anne Lane.

1743
01:20:55,817 --> 01:20:58,687
That's how you know Mark Schall
knew exactly what he was doing.

1744
01:21:01,857 --> 01:21:02,827
[clanking]

1745
01:21:05,293 --> 01:21:07,263
BROOKE: Yes, it does
seem unbelievable.

1746
01:21:07,362 --> 01:21:10,162
In fact, every one of the
doctors that examined Mark

1747
01:21:10,265 --> 01:21:12,565
were initially skeptical.

1748
01:21:12,667 --> 01:21:16,337
But afterward, every one of them
came to the same conclusion,

1749
01:21:16,438 --> 01:21:20,578
that Mark Schall had
indeed been sleepwalking.

1750
01:21:20,675 --> 01:21:23,915
So why did a sleepwalking Mark
Schall go to his in-law's house

1751
01:21:24,012 --> 01:21:25,352
that night?

1752
01:21:25,447 --> 01:21:28,247
Probably because as he
fell asleep on the sofa,

1753
01:21:28,350 --> 01:21:31,690
he was anxious about his
meeting with Anne and Roth.

1754
01:21:31,786 --> 01:21:35,086
Deep in sleep an hour
or two later, Mark

1755
01:21:35,190 --> 01:21:36,960
subconsciously went
through the motions

1756
01:21:37,058 --> 01:21:39,828
that he knew he would go
through later that day.

1757
01:21:39,928 --> 01:21:43,428
[dramatic music]

1758
01:21:47,435 --> 01:21:49,375
Mark, what are you doing here?

1759
01:21:49,471 --> 01:21:50,571
Is something wrong?

1760
01:21:50,672 --> 01:21:53,112
BROOKE: But somehow in
his sleepwalking mind,

1761
01:21:53,208 --> 01:21:54,578
he got confused.

1762
01:21:54,676 --> 01:21:57,016
He thought he was on a mission
to fix the heat register.

1763
01:21:57,112 --> 01:21:58,882
ANNE: Mark?

1764
01:21:58,980 --> 01:21:59,780
What are you doing?

01:22:00,749 --> 01:22:02,589
Ah!

1767
01:22:02,684 --> 01:22:07,754
BROOKE: When Anne Lane tried to
stop him, he reacted violently.

1768
01:22:07,856 --> 01:22:09,656
His anger aroused,
he pursued her

1769
01:22:09,758 --> 01:22:11,058
into the first-floor bedroom.

1770
01:22:11,159 --> 01:22:11,959
ANNE: Roth!

1771
01:22:12,060 --> 01:22:13,030
Roth!

1772
01:22:13,128 --> 01:22:15,298
BROOKE: There, Mark
ended up attempting

1773
01:22:15,397 --> 01:22:16,967
to strangle Ross Lane.

[shouting]

1775
01:22:19,467 --> 01:22:21,137
We believe Anne
rushed to the kitchen

1776
01:22:21,236 --> 01:22:24,806
to phone the police, found the
phone lying dead, got a knife,

1777
01:22:24,906 --> 01:22:27,346
and ran back into the bedroom
to protect her husband.

Stop it!

1781
01:22:31,780 --> 01:22:33,110
BROOKE: Mark grabbed
the knife from her

1782
01:22:33,214 --> 01:22:36,114
by the blade, something
no one in their right mind

1783
01:22:36,217 --> 01:22:37,517
would ever do.

1784
01:22:37,619 --> 01:22:41,119
ANNE: [screams]

1785
01:22:43,625 --> 01:22:45,525
BROOKE: In that
strange fugue state

1786
01:22:45,627 --> 01:22:50,497
we call sleepwalking, driven
by unknown forces of fear,

1787
01:22:50,598 --> 01:22:53,698
Mark Schall took the life
of his mother-in-law.

[gasps]

1789
01:22:58,873 --> 01:23:01,643
As much as we pride ourselves
on being a civilization

1790
01:23:01,743 --> 01:23:03,943
of knowledge and
reason, there remain

1791
01:23:04,045 --> 01:23:06,415
many mysteries about life.

1792
01:23:06,514 --> 01:23:10,414
One of them is sleepwalking,
that strange, primordial state

1793
01:23:10,518 --> 01:23:13,958
which led in this instance
to a senseless tragedy,

1794
01:23:14,055 --> 01:23:18,795
certainly for Anne Lane
and for her family,

1795
01:23:18,893 --> 01:23:21,663
but also for Mark
Schall, who must live

1796
01:23:21,763 --> 01:23:24,633
for the rest of his life
with the terrible burden

1797
01:23:24,733 --> 01:23:31,343
of knowing he inadvertently took
the life of someone he loved.

01:23:52,260 --> 01:23:53,830
I'm going to go get
something to drink.

1802
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:06,440
Hi.

1803
01:24:06,541 --> 01:24:07,441
Hi.

1804
01:24:11,813 --> 01:24:13,553
I don't know what to believe.

1805
01:24:13,648 --> 01:24:14,888
If he's convicted,
I'm always going

1806
01:24:14,983 --> 01:24:17,853
to think there's a possibility
that he's really innocent.

1807
01:24:17,952 --> 01:24:19,422
And if they find
him innocent, I'm

1808
01:24:19,521 --> 01:24:22,461
always going to think there's
a possibility that he's guilty.

1809
01:24:22,557 --> 01:24:24,627
I know.

1810
01:24:24,726 --> 01:24:28,026
I miss my granddaughter.

1811
01:24:28,129 --> 01:24:30,769
How about a picnic
on the weekend?

1812
01:24:30,865 --> 01:24:31,665
Yeah.

The defendant will rise.

In the case of
Mark David Schall,

the verdict of the jury
under instruction number one,

1817
01:25:03,098 --> 01:25:06,698
murder in the first
degree, not guilty.

01:25:14,342 --> 01:25:15,712
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury, thank you.

I wish you well.

1823
01:25:17,112 --> 01:25:19,952
You're dismissed.

1824
01:25:20,048 --> 01:25:23,348
Mr. Schall, you are free to go.

1825
01:25:23,451 --> 01:25:24,551
This court is adjourned.

REPORTER: Quickly, Michael,
can we have a comment

1833
01:25:53,882 --> 01:25:55,112
please on the verdict?

[reporters chattering]

1835
01:25:58,786 --> 01:25:59,856
How you feel
about the verdict?

1836
01:25:59,954 --> 01:26:01,524
Detective, were you
surprised by the verdict?

1837
01:26:01,623 --> 01:26:04,163
Want my opinion?

1838
01:26:04,259 --> 01:26:06,799
A killer has gone free
today because a defense

1839
01:26:06,895 --> 01:26:11,905
lawyer has found yet one
more loophole for the guilty.

If you answer a
few questions now,

1841
01:26:13,601 --> 01:26:14,741
they might leave you alone.

think about the jury verdict?

Mark, how do you feel?

1846
01:26:27,148 --> 01:26:27,978
Relieved.

1847
01:26:28,082 --> 01:26:29,382
Were you surprised
by the verdict?

1848
01:26:29,484 --> 01:26:30,614
Yes.

1849
01:26:30,718 --> 01:26:32,158
I can understand why people
might have their doubts.

1850
01:26:32,253 --> 01:26:33,793
Are you worried it
might happen again?

1851

No, no.

1852
01:26:34,822 --> 01:26:36,522
My doctors have
me on medication.

1853
01:26:36,624 --> 01:26:39,724
Lauren, will you and
Mark be staying together?

1854
01:26:39,827 --> 01:26:40,867
We're going home right now.

1855
01:26:40,962 --> 01:26:42,732

it one day at a time.
