1
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:32,657
Murphy's flushed to the outside

2
00:00:32,825 --> 00:00:36,536
and he is gonna be slammed to the turf
at the 31 by Jackson.

3
00:00:36,704 --> 00:00:39,038
Murphy getting zero protection
in the pocket

4
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:41,290
from this swarming
Cuyahoga defense,

5
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:45,044
but still keeping the Coldwater
Black Bears in this ball game.

6
00:00:45,212 --> 00:00:47,296
For those of you
just joining us, this is

7
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:49,424
the Ohio River Valley
Sports Network

8
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:51,592
reporting live from the 1991

9
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,262
Ohio high school football
state championship game

10
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:56,639
with the Cuyahoga Raiders
taking on

11
00:00:56,807 --> 00:00:59,934
the Cinderella story...
the Coldwater Black Bears.

12
00:01:00,102 --> 00:01:01,978
The perennial powerhouse
Red Raiders

13
00:01:02,146 --> 00:01:04,564
hail from the big city
of Cleveland, Ohio.

14
00:01:04,732 --> 00:01:08,735
Their high school has more students
than the entire population

15
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:11,112
of the small town of Coldwater.

16
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,115
And the big story for Coldwater
has been quarterback Scott Murphy,

17
00:01:14,283 --> 00:01:17,493
raised by a single mother
who works in a factory.

18
00:01:17,661 --> 00:01:19,704
He was recently named
"Mr. Football"

19
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:22,123
as the outstanding player
in the state.

20
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:25,001
This is it, folks.

21
00:01:25,169 --> 00:01:27,545
A Coldwater victory here
would be a fairy tale ending

22
00:01:27,713 --> 00:01:29,422
for this hardworking
blue-collar community.

23
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:31,466
13 seconds left in the game,

24
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:33,760
just one time out remaining.

25
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:36,179
Coldwater needs a touchdown
right here

26
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:38,222
to win the state championship.

27
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:41,726
Scott Murphy, "Mr. Football,"
deep to return the kick.

28
00:01:41,894 --> 00:01:44,020
And he'll take it
to the 50, to the 45.

29
00:01:44,188 --> 00:01:46,272
Murphy's hit, but he breaks the tackle,
stays on his feet,

30
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,815
- breaks another tackle...
- Come on, come on!

31
00:01:47,983 --> 00:01:49,776
Inside the 35, inside the 30,

32
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:51,736
and he's knocked down
at the 26.

33
00:01:51,904 --> 00:01:55,198
And he'll quickly call a time out
to talk to Coach Hand.

34
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:59,327
This has been
one of the great games

35
00:01:59,495 --> 00:02:01,996
in Ohio high school
football history.

36
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:06,959
3.5 seconds left on the clock
here in the fourth quarter.

37
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:09,003
Third down, 42-38.

38
00:02:09,171 --> 00:02:11,631
Words exchanged
on the sidelines

39
00:02:11,799 --> 00:02:14,091
as Murphy appears to be arguing

40
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:16,135
the final play call
by Coach Hand.

41
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:17,720
That's the play.

42
00:02:17,888 --> 00:02:19,972
They seem to have
agreed on something.

43
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,933
Murphy is headed back out
onto the field.

44
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,810
He's got one final play

45
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:26,521
to make a miracle happen
here in Coldwater.

46
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,689
- Murphy! Murphy!
- Black seven!

47
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:30,274
Black seven!
Hike!

48
00:02:30,442 --> 00:02:32,193
Murphy drops back, looks deep.

49
00:02:32,361 --> 00:02:33,611
Hall's wide open
in the end zone.

50
00:02:33,779 --> 00:02:35,905
He's open. He's open.
He's open!

51
00:02:36,949 --> 00:02:38,658
He tucks it. He's gonna run it.

52
00:02:44,206 --> 00:02:46,165
- Now inside the 20, to the 15...
- Run, run, run, run!

53
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:48,000
To the 10, to the 5!

54
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:52,547
Touchdown, Coldwater!

55
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:57,552
They will be the state champions
of Ohio!

56
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:36,173
I'm never drinking
with you lightweights again.

57
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:38,885
But you said that last week.

58
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:41,304
Yeah, well, I mean it this time.

59
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:48,311
That's it?

60
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:50,980
Ain't no tuck-in,
no kiss good night?

61
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:52,607
It's my birthday, Murph.

62
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:54,775
That's why I didn't drop you off
at the curb.

63
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:03,784
♪ So your hometown's
bringing you down ♪

64
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:06,954
♪ Or you're drowning
in the small talk... ♪

65
00:04:07,122 --> 00:04:08,873
I don't need help.

66
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:10,958
My body-to-booze ratio
is enormous.

67
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:12,501
I have the liver strength
of 10 men.

68
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:14,545
I'm not drunk.

69
00:04:18,842 --> 00:04:21,260
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
I got a sharp pain in my stomach.

70
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:23,137
- What does that mean?
- Don't eat three dozen wings.

71
00:04:23,305 --> 00:04:25,348
Now come on, man.
You know I'm paranoid.

72
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:27,433
- What side's your appendix on?
- Your right side. Now get up.

73
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:29,477
That's the side that hurts.
Oh, I got appendicitis.

74
00:04:29,645 --> 00:04:32,563
No, you don't have appendicitis.
You'd lose your appetite. Now let's go.

75
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:35,316
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Murphy, take a look at this.

76
00:04:35,484 --> 00:04:38,027
I need you to be the beneficiary
of my life insurance policy.

77
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:40,154
- Hell no, Dwight. Hell no.
- No, come on, man.

78
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:42,239
If I croak in my sleep, I need to know
my mom's taken care of.

79
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:43,824
I got plenty of people
I gotta worry about.

80
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:45,701
My brother would put her
in a home, man.

81
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:47,870
Please?

82
00:04:51,667 --> 00:04:54,001
Thanks, Murph.

83
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:56,170
Hey, we're worth a lot
dead, Murphy.

84
00:04:56,338 --> 00:04:58,464
If I bite it,
you can have some.

85
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:00,675
I know the bank's
been riding you, brother.

86
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:02,510
Just quit talking
and go back to sleep.

87
00:05:02,678 --> 00:05:04,512
You're "Mr. Football."

88
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,223
And in '91
you sent them packing.

89
00:05:07,391 --> 00:05:08,933
Don't sweat it, Murphy.

90
00:05:09,101 --> 00:05:11,352
You'll find a way to win.

91
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,521
You always did!

92
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:45,780
What are they doing up?

93
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:47,573
They heard you drive up.
They've been waiting

94
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:49,784
for you to come inside.

95
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:58,292
What do you do out there anyway?
Just listen to the radio?

96
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,336
Yeah, Mace.

97
00:07:00,504 --> 00:07:02,797
Just listen to the radio.

98
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:10,346
Hey, so don't forget
the bank appointment.

99
00:07:10,514 --> 00:07:13,766
How could I?
You told the whole town.

100
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:15,976
I didn't... I only told Sasha.

101
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:18,562
Mace, we live in "Backwater."

102
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:21,357
You tell one person... you might as well
put it up on a billboard.

103
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:25,861
Signal 50 Coldwater.

104
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:28,614
Units respond to 267 Main Street

105
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:30,783
for an unknown fire
to the rear of the building.

106
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:33,661
Signal 50 Coldwater volunteers
please respond,

107
00:07:33,829 --> 00:07:35,871
- 267 Main Street, for an unknown fire.
- Honey.

108
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:39,166
You've been up all night
and it's not even your shift.

109
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:41,168
You don't have to go.

110
00:07:51,513 --> 00:07:54,849
- What's going on, Gig? Is this it?
- Jesus, Coach...

111
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:58,435
walking down the street,
I was barbecuing.

112
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:00,354
- Wham! The whole grill is on fire.
- All right, go sit down.

113
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:02,690
Hang on a second.
You stay back with me on the pump.

114
00:08:02,858 --> 00:08:05,526
Barney, Rodriguez,
you guys handle the hose.

115
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:09,155
If you're gonna blame me,
at least let me fight it.

116
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,240
No, I'm not doing that.
I just want to talk to you

117
00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:13,200
about the halftime
ceremony tomorrow.

118
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:15,411
- I watch the station on game day.
- Celina can cover us.

119
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:18,873
Celina is 40 minutes away.
But, hey, if you don't need me,

120
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,916
I got plenty of work
I can do at home.

121
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:23,752
Like what?
Babysitting those damn beans?

122
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,838
You know, if you planted corn
like everybody else,

123
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:28,382
you could just sit back
and watch it grow. Charge the line.

124
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:31,051
So you're coaching
farmers now too?

125
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:33,512
Coldwater's corn country
for a reason.

126
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,639
Yeah, well, it used to be
football country too.

127
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:37,057
What are you, four and six?

128
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:39,101
- Six and four.
- Close enough.

129
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:40,936
You know, if that's meant
to hurt me, it doesn't.

130
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:43,564
These guys may not be as talented
as you guys once were, but I'll tell you

131
00:08:43,732 --> 00:08:46,066
something... they play twice as hard
and I like them just as much.

132
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:47,735
Yeah, well, you should be
seven and three

133
00:08:47,903 --> 00:08:49,778
if you'd have hit Taylor
on that deep post against Marion

134
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:52,448
instead of bringing in Wilson
to kick a 42-yard field goal,

135
00:08:52,616 --> 00:08:54,491
and the guy can't hit
the broad side of a barn.

136
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:57,077
You know, for somebody
who's too busy

137
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:58,871
to come down
and watch football games,

138
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:01,373
you sure as hell know a lot
about what's going on in 'em.

139
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,083
Yeah, well, I don't listen...

140
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:05,169
got 'em playing on the damn radio
at the station.

141
00:09:05,337 --> 00:09:09,089
You think I don't know where you go
on Friday nights?

142
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:11,342
You think I'm blind,
can't see your headlights

143
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:13,302
up there on that bluff?

144
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:15,429
Why don't you get your ass
out of that truck

145
00:09:15,597 --> 00:09:17,473
and down on the field
where it means something?

146
00:09:17,641 --> 00:09:19,475
It's bad enough to listen to you
lose on the radio.

147
00:09:19,643 --> 00:09:21,310
You think I want to come down
and witness it in person?

148
00:09:21,478 --> 00:09:23,103
Think you can do any better?

149
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:24,980
Come on down
and coach my quarterbacks.

150
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:27,441
Sure, as soon as you come help me
work my back 40.

151
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:29,526
I'll help you plant... some corn.

152
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:33,113
Why don't you worry about your field,
and I'll worry about mine?

153
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:52,693
People said you were crazy
for growing soybeans here,

154
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:54,528
but they look good to me.

155
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:56,697
Yeah, yeah, looking pretty good.
What've you got?

156
00:10:56,865 --> 00:10:58,866
Certified mail.

157
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:02,202
Is Sasha around?

158
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,246
She took the girls to the park.

159
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:06,665
Just put her stuff
on the porch.

160
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,709
Oh, wait. One more thing.

161
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:12,046
My mom said that Macy told
Joanne Bragden

162
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:15,049
to tell her to tell me
to tell you to get a move on...

163
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:17,176
something about
"Frank and a tie"?

164
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:36,403
Mr. Murphy, it's been 120 days
since your last payment.

165
00:11:36,571 --> 00:11:38,864
Frank said we could
work something out...

166
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:41,408
something about a "forbearance"
till harvest.

167
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:43,952
I filled out
all this paperwork.

168
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:47,414
The crop's about 80% right now.

169
00:11:47,582 --> 00:11:49,917
It's gonna be ready to harvest
real soon.

170
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,961
Were you friends with Frank?

171
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:55,005
Yeah, kinda.

172
00:11:55,173 --> 00:11:57,091
I played ball with Chris Hall.

173
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:59,259
- Chris who?
- The football player

174
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:01,470
who does your ads.

175
00:12:06,101 --> 00:12:07,935
Mr. Murphy, I am...

176
00:12:08,103 --> 00:12:10,479
I'm sure that...

177
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:13,524
Frank thought he was helping you out,
but he's actually

178
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:15,526
put you in a pretty bad
situation.

179
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:18,654
It's not that bad, is it?

180
00:12:18,822 --> 00:12:21,407
To be honest, Mr. Murphy,
based on your equity

181
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,534
and your
employment history, this...

182
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:25,702
this loan should have never been
approved.

183
00:12:27,038 --> 00:12:30,874
Well, I already got the loan.
I just need the extension.

184
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:34,169
It's too late for an extension.

185
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:36,171
The bank's already
called in your loan.

186
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:39,967
What do you mean?
What do you mean, called in my loan?

187
00:12:40,135 --> 00:12:42,636
The power of sale foreclosure
proceedings have already begun.

188
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:45,389
Your property will be on the market
in the next several days

189
00:12:45,557 --> 00:12:49,476
unless... unless you can pay
a significant sum here today.

190
00:12:49,644 --> 00:12:51,520
I'm a farmer.

191
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:54,106
I can't pay you
until my crops are ready.

192
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:57,317
If you can raise something
before we get any offers,

193
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:59,486
I'm sure we might be able
to take another look.

194
00:12:59,654 --> 00:13:01,864
Otherwise I'm sorry,
Mr. Murphy.

195
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:03,991
Well, I'm not asking you
for a bailout.

196
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:07,494
I can pay you in two weeks,
in less than a month.

197
00:13:07,662 --> 00:13:10,122
There's nothing I can do.
I'm sorry.

198
00:13:15,837 --> 00:13:17,963
Okay, ladies,

199
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:19,840
pick your poison.

200
00:13:20,008 --> 00:13:21,508
Operation. Operation.

201
00:13:21,676 --> 00:13:23,177
Play this one.

202
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:25,179
Nah...

203
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:26,805
Look at this thing.

204
00:13:50,205 --> 00:13:52,206
Two guys wide open...

205
00:13:54,042 --> 00:13:56,668
and you run it, like an idiot.

206
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:30,369
Daddy? Daddy?

207
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:49,012
Sorry, I fell asleep
with the girls.

208
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:51,640
No, that's okay.
How did it go at the bank?

209
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:53,392
It went great.

210
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:57,020
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

211
00:14:57,188 --> 00:14:59,439
What did I tell you?
I knew it would work out.

212
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:02,192
Guess who I ran into.

213
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,694
Who's that?

214
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:05,654
They wanted to stick around
and say hi.

215
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:12,494
Oh, there he is.

216
00:15:13,955 --> 00:15:15,247
"Mr. Football."

217
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:18,208
Hey, Hall.

218
00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:20,919
Hey, Hall?
What the hell is that?

219
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,631
Hey, Scotty. Nice to see you.

220
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:26,425
- How have you been, buddy?
- Good.

221
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:27,968
I send you tickets.
I don't see you.

222
00:15:28,136 --> 00:15:31,346
I ain't got many years
left in me, you know?

223
00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:33,640
Oh, hey, we got the Steelers
on Monday,

224
00:15:33,808 --> 00:15:37,102
but I wanted to get back
for the ceremony and see the guys.

225
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:39,313
Check it.

226
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,939
Oh, yeah.

227
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:43,817
- I don't think mine would fit anymore.
- Like a glove.

228
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:45,819
Come on, Mace,
the girls are next door.

229
00:15:45,987 --> 00:15:47,362
We really should get going.

230
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:49,615
Oh, that's right.
You have kids.

231
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,158
Two.

232
00:15:51,326 --> 00:15:54,286
Hey, why don't you guys
come for dinner?

233
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:57,080
- I can cook and...
- Mace, I'm sure they got plenty of...

234
00:15:57,248 --> 00:15:59,583
- No, you could just catch up.
- People they have to see besides us.

235
00:15:59,751 --> 00:16:01,752
Come on, we really should
get going... the girls.

236
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:04,296
- Okay.
- It's good seeing you guys.

237
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:06,381
Yeah.

238
00:16:10,178 --> 00:16:13,055
- Thank you.
- No, it's so good to see you guys.

239
00:16:14,432 --> 00:16:17,476
- I got it.
- Oh, thank you.

240
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:20,562
Hey, we're doing something
at Pal's after the game.

241
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:23,148
You'd better be there.

242
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:25,734
See you guys.

243
00:16:25,902 --> 00:16:27,319
Great.

244
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:29,196
Yeah.

245
00:16:41,376 --> 00:16:43,543
I thought you'd be excited.

246
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:46,588
You were so close
in high school.

247
00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:49,257
Yeah, well, high school
was a long time ago.

248
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:51,885
Are you mad they're together?

249
00:16:52,053 --> 00:16:54,262
No. What kind of question
is that?

250
00:16:56,391 --> 00:16:58,266
You know, if I...

251
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:01,228
if I saw my high school flame
with my best friend,

252
00:17:01,396 --> 00:17:02,813
I might wonder.

253
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,899
Yeah, well,
I really could care less.

254
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:08,068
Since when did you have
a high school flame?

255
00:17:08,236 --> 00:17:10,904
Well, we weren't "class couple"

256
00:17:11,072 --> 00:17:12,823
like you two or anything,

257
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:16,201
but if I hadn't fallen for you
when you were laid up in the hospital,

258
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:18,370
who knows?

259
00:17:20,915 --> 00:17:21,998
Whatever.

260
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:25,585
I'm just saying
I wouldn't mind having them over.

261
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:27,379
I think it'd be good.

262
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:29,881
Good for what?

263
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:33,051
So we can talk about how I got laid off
when the plant closed down?

264
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:35,971
Or good so they can walk in the den
and see the holes in the walls

265
00:17:36,139 --> 00:17:38,014
and the plastic
covering the windows?

266
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:40,684
If they're so interested
in seeing holes in walls

267
00:17:40,852 --> 00:17:42,728
and plastic covering windows,

268
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:45,564
they don't have to
walk into the den.

269
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:48,400
We've got that
right out on the porch.

270
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:58,118
You're crazy, you know that?

271
00:17:59,871 --> 00:18:01,705
Now who the hell
was your high school flame?

272
00:18:01,873 --> 00:18:04,166
Wouldn't you like to know?

273
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:07,502
So what,
now you aren't gonna tell me?

274
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:27,439
Daddy, can we sleep with you?

275
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:29,858
We're cold.

276
00:18:30,026 --> 00:18:31,610
Okay, come on.

277
00:18:34,155 --> 00:18:35,655
Yay.

278
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:38,158
- Are we going under the covers?
- Come here, sweetie.

279
00:18:38,326 --> 00:18:40,494
Daddy.

280
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:43,330
Where are you going?

281
00:18:43,498 --> 00:18:44,623
- Honey.
- Daddy?

282
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:45,999
Dad?

283
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:03,016
They're frozen.
The damn beans are frozen.

284
00:19:03,184 --> 00:19:05,185
It's okay.
It's gonna warm up, right?

285
00:19:05,353 --> 00:19:06,978
No, it's not okay.
If we don't harvest today,

286
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,688
they're gonna rot off the bush.

287
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:10,315
What are you looking for?

288
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:12,192
The phone book. Where's the phone book?
I gotta call Red.

289
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,611
- Wait, wait, it's here. It's okay.
- We're gonna lose our...

290
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:16,404
we're gonna lose everything.

291
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:18,990
- No, honey, no. We're not gonna...
- I can't believe the frost. Damn it.

292
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:22,369
No. Listen to me.
We're not gonna lose everything, okay?

293
00:19:22,537 --> 00:19:24,621
- You said it was 80%, right?
- Yeah.

294
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:26,540
Okay, so we make 80%.

295
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:28,333
We harvest sooner

296
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:30,502
and we get the money
to the bank sooner.

297
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:33,463
Yeah. Yeah.

298
00:19:33,631 --> 00:19:34,923
- Okay.
- It's okay.

299
00:19:35,091 --> 00:19:37,133
Okay, I gotta call Red.

300
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:38,468
Okay.

301
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:41,555
The freeze hit hard all over.

302
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:44,933
They've been calling from Illinois
to Michigan for one of these...

303
00:19:45,101 --> 00:19:48,353
probably the last soy header
in the area.

304
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:50,397
Thanks for bringing it
so quickly, Red.

305
00:19:50,565 --> 00:19:52,190
Hey, no problem.

306
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:53,942
Thanks, Red.
You're a lifesaver.

307
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:57,404
Better get those beans in
before the rain gets here

308
00:19:57,572 --> 00:19:59,739
or you won't be running that thing
through that field.

309
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:01,408
I know, Red. Thanks.

310
00:20:02,493 --> 00:20:05,745
Hustle up... you can make
the halftime ceremony.

311
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:44,492
What was that?

312
00:20:53,461 --> 00:20:55,754
Damn.

313
00:21:43,386 --> 00:21:45,512
Honey, I heard the noise
from the house.

314
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,555
Thank God you're okay.

315
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:49,641
I'm not okay.
Every cent we had,

316
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:52,018
every penny my mom left us is gone.
It's all wasted.

317
00:21:52,186 --> 00:21:53,561
Oh, honey, calm down.

318
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:56,064
Calm down? I just broke
the last soy header in the state.

319
00:21:56,232 --> 00:21:58,108
Well, Red can fix it, I'm sure.

320
00:21:58,275 --> 00:22:00,694
Yeah, in two or three days.
The beans will be rotten by then.

321
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:03,488
- So we pick them.
- Pick them? It's 200 acres, Macy.

322
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:05,991
Don't be so stupid.

323
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:09,369
Scott...

324
00:22:14,542 --> 00:22:17,293
I'm sorry. Just go back inside.

325
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:20,672
I'm gonna go down and see
if Red can find me another header, okay?

326
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,674
Okay.

327
00:23:30,076 --> 00:23:31,993
Okay, are we ready?

328
00:23:32,161 --> 00:23:34,662
- Daddy.
- There you are.

329
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:37,373
Hey. Hey.

330
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,250
Are you guys ready
for the game?

331
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:40,460
Yeah.

332
00:23:40,628 --> 00:23:43,463
I tried to call the shop,
but I didn't get an answer.

333
00:23:43,631 --> 00:23:45,173
They had an extra one
at Hoover Heights.

334
00:23:45,341 --> 00:23:47,092
Yeah? The rain's not gonna be
a problem?

335
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:48,676
No, Red said it's gonna
let up any minute.

336
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:50,970
- Okay.
- Hey, you guys get going to the game.

337
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:53,056
- Get in the car with Sasha.
- Come on, guys, let's go.

338
00:23:53,224 --> 00:23:54,682
- Don't forget your football.
- Are you coming with us?

339
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:57,060
No, I'm gonna meet you guys
at the diner after the game.

340
00:23:57,228 --> 00:23:58,978
- Okay.
- Bye, Daddy.

341
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:01,147
- You're gonna come when you're done?
- Yeah. You guys go on.

342
00:24:01,315 --> 00:24:02,899
- I'll meet you at Pal's afterwards.
- Okay.

343
00:24:03,067 --> 00:24:05,693
Okay, you guys, come on.

344
00:24:11,826 --> 00:24:13,326
Coldwater is struggling here

345
00:24:13,494 --> 00:24:15,870
on a rainy homecoming
Saturday afternoon,

346
00:24:16,038 --> 00:24:18,581
down by 14 already
in the first quarter,

347
00:24:18,749 --> 00:24:21,501
Coach Hand probably wishing
some of these players here today

348
00:24:21,669 --> 00:24:24,087
were from the 1991
state championship team.

349
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:31,094
And everyone
is hoping the rain lets up

350
00:24:31,262 --> 00:24:33,304
in time for
the halftime ceremony

351
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:35,515
to recognize
the '91 state champions

352
00:24:35,683 --> 00:24:39,435
who won big here
on this field 20 years ago.

353
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:41,813
That team was led
by Scott Murphy...

354
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:43,481
"Mr. Football."

355
00:24:43,649 --> 00:24:45,567
Chris Hall is here
signing autographs...

356
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:19,017
Don't sweat it, Murphy.
You'll find a way to win.

357
00:25:19,185 --> 00:25:21,436
You always did.

358
00:25:30,404 --> 00:25:33,448
We're worth a lot dead, Murphy.

359
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:44,102
Scotty.

360
00:26:50,651 --> 00:26:52,485
What are you doing, man?

361
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:59,284
Thank God. I'm such an idiot.

362
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:09,794
Why is it all foggy?

363
00:27:09,962 --> 00:27:11,629
Are you making out
with yourself in there?

364
00:27:14,008 --> 00:27:15,508
What the...?

365
00:27:22,266 --> 00:27:24,142
What the hell?

366
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:26,894
Come on. We're gonna be late.

367
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:28,479
Late for what?

368
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:41,034
Hey, Murphy,
good game last week, man.

369
00:27:46,248 --> 00:27:48,624
Hi, Scotty.

370
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:55,256
Scott Murphy,
where have you been?

371
00:27:55,424 --> 00:27:58,343
If you guys are gonna skip
sixth period, at least tell me.

372
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,386
I was waiting around for you
like an idiot.

373
00:28:00,554 --> 00:28:02,597
I'm so mad at you,
I could just...

374
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:08,061
I could just...

375
00:28:12,733 --> 00:28:14,901
Why can't I stay mad at you?

376
00:28:15,069 --> 00:28:16,861
Oh, you guys make me sick.

377
00:28:18,572 --> 00:28:20,406
Hustle up, lover boy.

378
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:23,326
What's going on? Am I dead?

379
00:28:23,494 --> 00:28:25,411
We're both dead
unless you hurry up.

380
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:41,386
Yo, Murph,
hey, check out my new game face.

381
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:42,970
I call it "Fourth Down." Ready?

382
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:49,769
Tough.

383
00:28:49,937 --> 00:28:51,354
Pearson, you look so skinny.

384
00:28:51,522 --> 00:28:54,107
Hey, I've been working out, man.

385
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:55,817
I got balls.

386
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:57,610
Hey, come on, D,
he's just hating you, bro.

387
00:28:57,778 --> 00:29:01,280
Oh, I get it. You're just trying my
confidence before the big game, right?

388
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:03,116
These guns go bang, baby.

389
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:06,661
Murphy, get in here.

390
00:29:10,332 --> 00:29:12,959
Close the door.

391
00:29:13,127 --> 00:29:15,128
All right, what happened
to you today?

392
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:18,881
Mrs. Bird said
you weren't in Lit class... again.

393
00:29:19,049 --> 00:29:21,300
No, Coach.

394
00:29:22,678 --> 00:29:24,554
I wasn't anywhere near
Lit class today.

395
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:26,806
Well, you missing class
isn't funny to me, Scott.

396
00:29:26,974 --> 00:29:29,308
I don't know why
it's funny to you.

397
00:29:30,811 --> 00:29:32,145
Sit down.

398
00:29:35,816 --> 00:29:37,525
All right, look,

399
00:29:37,693 --> 00:29:40,361
I know you've already got
one foot out of this town.

400
00:29:40,529 --> 00:29:42,280
And a lot of people
around here think

401
00:29:42,448 --> 00:29:44,449
that whatever you do on Friday night
is all that matters.

402
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:45,992
Well, I'm not one of them.

403
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,827
I want you to be a man

404
00:29:47,995 --> 00:29:50,288
who's good for more than
one night a week.

405
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:54,542
If you skip class one more time,
Scott, I'm gonna bench you.

406
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:56,836
I don't care if I gotta play
a freshman quarterback

407
00:29:57,004 --> 00:29:59,005
in the state finals.
I'll do it.

408
00:29:59,173 --> 00:30:01,757
Coach...

409
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:03,843
you mean we'll play Cuyahoga
this week?

410
00:30:04,011 --> 00:30:05,678
Is that supposed to be
funny too?

411
00:30:05,846 --> 00:30:07,889
You know, the Red Raiders
got seven all-Americans

412
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:11,142
and one linebacker who thinks you
cheated him out of being "Mr. Football."

413
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:13,811
He'd like nothing better
than to clean your clock.

414
00:30:13,979 --> 00:30:15,313
Get dressed.

415
00:30:15,481 --> 00:30:18,191
All right then, suicides

416
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:20,735
if everybody is not on the field
in two minutes.

417
00:30:20,903 --> 00:30:23,362
Let's go. Let's go.

418
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:28,367
Let's go, guys.
Let's go. Let's pick it up.

419
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:41,047
This is crazy.

420
00:30:42,508 --> 00:30:44,383
Well, ladies and gentlemen,

421
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:46,469
our quarterback
has decided to join us.

422
00:30:46,637 --> 00:30:48,346
- You can thank him personally later.
- What happened, Murph?

423
00:30:48,514 --> 00:30:50,723
What's the matter with you, Murph?

424
00:30:50,891 --> 00:30:52,016
Sorry, guys.

425
00:30:52,184 --> 00:30:53,976
All right, offense, defense,
line it up.

426
00:30:54,144 --> 00:30:56,521
- Red 24... let's run it.
- Let's go, D. Come on now.

427
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:59,232
- You want me to quarterback?
- Scott, knock it off.

428
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:00,983
Get in there
and play some football.

429
00:31:01,151 --> 00:31:04,195
Hall, what's Red?
Is that with you in the slot or...?

430
00:31:04,363 --> 00:31:06,197
- That's not funny, man.
- Let's go Red.

431
00:31:06,365 --> 00:31:09,075
Come on, D, let's do it.
Come through, come through.

432
00:31:09,243 --> 00:31:11,202
Come on, man. Okay, Red 24.

433
00:31:12,246 --> 00:31:13,746
Red 24.

434
00:31:15,332 --> 00:31:17,375
- Get off my butt, Murph.
- The center's over here, Murph.

435
00:31:19,086 --> 00:31:21,254
Get him this time.

436
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:24,632
Down.

437
00:31:25,676 --> 00:31:26,717
Set.

438
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:28,219
Hut. Hike.

439
00:31:32,266 --> 00:31:34,767
I got him. I got him.

440
00:31:34,935 --> 00:31:36,561
There we go.
That's twice this year.

441
00:31:40,774 --> 00:31:43,943
Who's skinny now?

442
00:31:44,111 --> 00:31:45,778
Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no.

443
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:49,115
Are you all right?

444
00:31:49,283 --> 00:31:51,867
- He was too big?
- What were you thinking?

445
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:53,911
Nice job, Pearson, you dummy.

446
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:56,414
Hey, are you okay?

447
00:31:58,041 --> 00:31:59,917
That one felt real, Coach.

448
00:32:00,085 --> 00:32:02,962
Damn right it's real.
Keep moving like a pregnant goat,

449
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:04,880
you won't last three downs
on Friday night.

450
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:07,216
Cuyahoga hits 10 times harder
than Pearson.

451
00:32:07,384 --> 00:32:08,634
- Hey.
- They want nothing better

452
00:32:08,802 --> 00:32:10,678
than to get you
out of the game.

453
00:32:10,846 --> 00:32:12,471
You're a running quarterback
on that play.

454
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:14,348
The pocket breaks down,
what do you do?

455
00:32:14,516 --> 00:32:15,725
- You...
- Move.

456
00:32:15,892 --> 00:32:17,643
Move! Come on, let's go.

457
00:32:17,811 --> 00:32:19,687
All right, play football.
Let's go, boys.

458
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:23,232
That one felt really real.

459
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:26,068
Come on, D. Come on, man.

460
00:32:26,236 --> 00:32:28,154
Okay.

461
00:32:31,617 --> 00:32:33,367
Down!

462
00:32:33,535 --> 00:32:34,744
Set!

463
00:32:34,911 --> 00:32:37,496
Black EG! Black EG!

464
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:38,998
Hike!

465
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:48,382
Baby!

466
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:49,925
Bite me.

467
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:52,136
- How about that?
- Shut up.

468
00:32:52,304 --> 00:32:54,805
That's what I'm talking about.

Take it in. Good stuff.

487
00:33:44,481 --> 00:33:47,316
Oh, come on, Coach, one more.
I'm just getting started.

488
00:33:47,484 --> 00:33:49,735
Hey, Hall, give me the ball.

489
00:33:49,903 --> 00:33:51,570
Where's Gig?

490
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:53,989
Gig, let's run a post, all right?
You haven't had one yet.

491
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:56,283
- No, come on, come on.
- That's not funny, Murphy.

492
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:59,412
What's Hall doing?
Hey, let's go, baby.

493
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:00,746
- Oh, man.
- What?

494
00:34:00,914 --> 00:34:02,331
- Snap the ball.
- Knock it off, will you?

495
00:34:02,499 --> 00:34:04,750
- What?
- What's wrong with you?

496
00:34:05,752 --> 00:34:07,420
Guys...?

497
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:13,050
Hey, Coach,
can I ask you something?

498
00:34:13,218 --> 00:34:15,344
No, I don't know if this game's
gonna be on TV.

499
00:34:15,512 --> 00:34:17,096
The minute I do,
I'll let you know. Here.

500
00:34:17,264 --> 00:34:19,140
No, it's not that.

501
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:22,017
Have you ever had a dream
that you're young again?

502
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:23,686
Sure. Almost every night.

503
00:34:23,854 --> 00:34:25,938
Yeah, but what if it wasn't a dream?
What if it was real?

504
00:34:26,106 --> 00:34:27,815
Well, that'd be something.

505
00:34:27,983 --> 00:34:29,984
No, no, no, Coach, I'm serious.

506
00:34:30,152 --> 00:34:33,446
This isn't some kind of
life-after-death thing.

507
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:35,781
We're standing here.
I'm real...

508
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:38,826
you're real.

509
00:34:45,167 --> 00:34:47,752
Son, don't make me start
testing for drugs,

510
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:51,046
not before the biggest game
this town's ever played.

511
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:58,471
Okay.

512
00:34:58,638 --> 00:35:00,639
Bye. See you tomorrow.

513
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:05,144
Hey, Sasha, wait up.

514
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:09,440
Oh, hey... oh my gosh.

515
00:35:09,608 --> 00:35:11,150
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

516
00:35:11,318 --> 00:35:14,487
- I'm sorry.
- What? What? Stop looking.

517
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:16,530
I'm sorry for everything. I...

518
00:35:16,698 --> 00:35:19,909
Oh. I'm sorry.

519
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:22,995
Macy!

520
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:46,227
I hate that one.

521
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,773
Hey, let's get inside
while there's still hot water.

522
00:35:51,775 --> 00:35:53,526
Let's go.

523
00:35:58,198 --> 00:35:59,532
Todd.

524
00:36:01,451 --> 00:36:03,035
Hey, want a ride?

525
00:36:03,203 --> 00:36:05,412
The last time you offered me a ride,
I ended up

526
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:08,290
hanging from a hook in the girls'
locker room by my underwear.

527
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:10,960
That was a long time ago.

528
00:36:11,127 --> 00:36:13,003
That was last Tuesday.

529
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:14,755
Todd?

530
00:36:14,923 --> 00:36:17,383
Stop torturing the dorks.

531
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:21,637
Let's talk about

532
00:36:21,805 --> 00:36:23,806
how great next year
is gonna be.

533
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:35,901
So my dad said
that Coach Cooper

534
00:36:36,069 --> 00:36:37,903
told the head of
the alumni association

535
00:36:38,071 --> 00:36:40,447
that you are going to start
next year.

536
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:43,492
You know what that means?

537
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:45,911
No redshirt year,
so you can go pro sooner.

538
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:47,663
And I'll take extra credits

539
00:36:47,831 --> 00:36:49,623
so that I can graduate early
and go with you.

540
00:36:49,791 --> 00:36:52,835
And I'll just get a TV job
wherever you end up playing.

541
00:36:53,003 --> 00:36:54,879
I have it all planned.

542
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:57,047
It'll be perfect.

543
00:37:00,385 --> 00:37:04,430
What if that plan changes?
What if I get hurt?

544
00:37:04,598 --> 00:37:06,015
Don't talk like that.

545
00:37:06,182 --> 00:37:08,601
You're not gonna get hurt.
You're the best.

546
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:11,103
Scotty, you just passed
my house.

547
00:37:11,271 --> 00:37:13,647
Yeah, right. I forgot.

548
00:37:20,906 --> 00:37:24,116
So...

549
00:37:24,284 --> 00:37:26,702
my parents aren't home
right now.

550
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:30,331
And I know how you get tense
before a big game,

551
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:32,583
so...

552
00:37:32,751 --> 00:37:34,919
I thought maybe...

553
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:37,129
Come on.

554
00:37:37,297 --> 00:37:39,423
I can't.

555
00:37:39,591 --> 00:37:41,717
Sorry.

556
00:37:41,885 --> 00:37:43,969
All right, well,
I can wait till Saturday.

557
00:37:45,722 --> 00:37:49,558
Oh, and don't forget to tell your mom
about the recruiter visit on Thursday.

558
00:37:49,726 --> 00:37:51,727
Okay.

559
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:55,773
Bye.

560
00:37:59,152 --> 00:38:01,487
My mom.

561
00:38:46,116 --> 00:38:47,700
Biscuit.

562
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:49,451
Hey, old buddy.

563
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:51,036
Hey.

564
00:38:51,204 --> 00:38:53,998
Look at you.

565
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:58,502
Stop messing with the dog
and go get your dinner.

566
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:00,337
It's getting cold.

567
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:04,133
Mom...

568
00:39:10,223 --> 00:39:12,224
Always late,
just like your father.

569
00:39:12,392 --> 00:39:13,726
Mom.

570
00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:17,229
Hey.

571
00:39:17,397 --> 00:39:19,273
All right, come on, come on.
You're gonna make me late.

572
00:39:19,441 --> 00:39:21,233
Let's go.

573
00:39:22,235 --> 00:39:24,737
You look so beautiful, Mom.

574
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:26,822
Get out of here.

575
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:28,699
Mom, wait.

576
00:39:28,867 --> 00:39:30,826
- Why don't you call in sick?
- Oh, yeah.

577
00:39:30,994 --> 00:39:32,911
- Let's stay in and watch old movies.
- Sure, sure, no problem.

578
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:34,997
Hey, skedaddle. Go. I'm late.

579
00:39:35,165 --> 00:39:36,957
Come on, Mom.

580
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:40,085
Just please stay.
Take the night off.

581
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:44,214
Not until my numbers hit,
sweetheart.

582
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:52,389
They never did.

583
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:02,876
Yo, Murphy.

584
00:41:06,214 --> 00:41:08,507
Hey, what are you doing?

585
00:41:08,675 --> 00:41:10,843
I've never really
read these before.

586
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:13,011
I could go
to all these places...

587
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:16,223
Notre Dame, Penn State,
California, Florida.

588
00:41:16,391 --> 00:41:17,808
I could go to Hawaii.

589
00:41:17,976 --> 00:41:20,102
Hawaii? They suck at football.

590
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:22,771
Besides, you already
verbally committed to Ohio State.

591
00:41:22,939 --> 00:41:26,108
And hey, do me a favor...

592
00:41:26,276 --> 00:41:28,193
stop pissing off Coach
at practice.

593
00:41:28,361 --> 00:41:30,529
I need you playing
Friday night.

594
00:41:30,697 --> 00:41:32,781
I mean, realistically I know
we're probably gonna lose,

595
00:41:32,949 --> 00:41:35,200
but I need to have a good game.

596
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:38,412
You don't think we can win?

597
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:40,998
Read the papers, man.
No one does.

598
00:41:41,166 --> 00:41:44,168
They're saying we'll be lucky
to get off the field in one piece.

599
00:41:45,461 --> 00:41:47,212
Are we going running or what?

600
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:49,381
Run? We just had practice.

601
00:41:49,549 --> 00:41:51,216
You don't want to run...
I don't want to run.

602
00:41:51,384 --> 00:41:53,594
I don't know why you like
freaking running so much anyway.

603
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:56,513
It helps me clear my head.

604
00:41:56,681 --> 00:41:59,391
Whatever. You got a new antenna
for this piece yet?

605
00:41:59,559 --> 00:42:01,768
Who's faster? Me or you?

606
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:03,562
I don't know. Probably me.

607
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:05,564
Well, come on. Let's find out.

608
00:42:08,151 --> 00:42:10,027
What, you want to race?

609
00:42:10,195 --> 00:42:11,904
Till Tessier's farm.

610
00:42:12,071 --> 00:42:13,864
Come on, man. I want to know.

611
00:42:14,032 --> 00:42:16,325
Do you really think we should
overexert ourselves right now?

612
00:42:16,492 --> 00:42:17,868
What, are you scared?

613
00:42:18,036 --> 00:42:19,411
No.

614
00:42:19,579 --> 00:42:21,079
No, man, you know what?

615
00:42:21,247 --> 00:42:23,415
I got some trig homework to do,
so I think I'm just gonna head out.

616
00:42:23,583 --> 00:42:26,585
Go! Sucker!

617
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:41,934

about my article.

635
00:43:49,294 --> 00:43:51,003
I'll be two minutes.

636
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:56,383
- Hey, Murphy.
- Scott.

637
00:44:14,861 --> 00:44:18,113
- Here, let me help you.
- No, I got it. I got it.

638
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:22,701
- Here.
- Thank you.

639
00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:28,707
So...

640
00:44:30,543 --> 00:44:33,545
do you even know who I am?

641
00:44:36,758 --> 00:44:40,010
Of course I know who you are.

642
00:44:41,637 --> 00:44:45,098
You're the guy who spray-painted
the band locker room last year.

643
00:44:46,726 --> 00:44:49,394
We spent spring break
trying to clean it.

644
00:44:49,562 --> 00:44:50,562
Thanks.

645
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:52,856
Next time you get the urge
to spray words onto something,

646
00:44:53,024 --> 00:44:54,816
could you try
spelling them right?

647
00:44:54,984 --> 00:44:57,152
You know,
maybe bring a dictionary

648
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:59,738
or practice on some paper
with your crayons first?

649
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:03,867
She...

650
00:45:08,956 --> 00:45:12,084
All right, guys, come on in here.
Let's take a knee.

651
00:45:12,251 --> 00:45:14,544
Okay, a little business first.

652
00:45:14,712 --> 00:45:16,880
I got some good news
and some bad news.

653
00:45:17,048 --> 00:45:18,423
The bad news is

654
00:45:18,591 --> 00:45:20,884
we're not gonna be playing
in Columbus on Friday night.

655
00:45:21,052 --> 00:45:22,844
What? Why?

656
00:45:23,012 --> 00:45:26,056
Ohio Stadium went from turf
to grass last year.

657
00:45:26,224 --> 00:45:28,266
Since Ohio State's playing
Michigan this Saturday,

658
00:45:28,434 --> 00:45:29,935
we had to sell, like,
I don't know,

659
00:45:30,103 --> 00:45:31,645
10,000 tickets or something
to cover the green fees.

660
00:45:31,813 --> 00:45:34,398
We didn't sell enough tickets
to use the grass?

661
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:37,484
They offered to let us play there
if we didn't bring the band.

662
00:45:37,652 --> 00:45:39,486
They didn't want them
messing up the field at halftime.

663
00:45:39,654 --> 00:45:41,113
We're not playing
'cause of the band?

664
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,824
The band's part of our team, Pearson.
It's part of our town.

665
00:45:43,991 --> 00:45:46,743
If the band can't play there,
then we can't play there either.

666
00:45:46,911 --> 00:45:47,953
What's the good news?

667
00:45:48,121 --> 00:45:50,539
The good news is we won the coin toss.
We're playing right here.

668
00:45:50,706 --> 00:45:53,417
That's the good news?

669
00:45:54,836 --> 00:45:58,004
No scout's gonna drive out here
to "Backwater."

670
00:45:58,172 --> 00:46:00,132
Oh, I don't know, Hall.
Maybe not quite as many.

671
00:46:00,299 --> 00:46:02,300
Guys, we have
home field advantage.

672
00:46:02,468 --> 00:46:05,137
Yeah, some advantage.
Maybe they'll slip on a cow patty.

673
00:46:05,304 --> 00:46:08,473
Look, at least let's be honest.
The reason we didn't get the field

674
00:46:08,641 --> 00:46:10,016
is they think that
we're gonna get killed.

675
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:11,518
I don't know.
You might be right.

676
00:46:11,686 --> 00:46:14,896
I guess you can get down
because somewhere

677
00:46:15,064 --> 00:46:18,191
somebody who doesn't even know you
doesn't believe in you.

678
00:46:18,359 --> 00:46:20,485
Or you could look around
and be happy about the fact

679
00:46:20,653 --> 00:46:23,071
that you're playing in front of
the hardworking people who live here...

680
00:46:23,239 --> 00:46:26,366
you know, be a little grateful that
those same people who do believe in you

681
00:46:26,534 --> 00:46:28,910
and can't afford a fancy
hotel room in the city

682
00:46:29,078 --> 00:46:32,164
can now come out and actually
watch your sorry ass play.

683
00:46:40,006 --> 00:46:41,506
Line it up.

684
00:47:04,572 --> 00:47:08,450
Hey.

685
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:12,412
I was watching you practice
back there.

686
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:14,831
I never really knew how complicated
those moves were,

687
00:47:14,999 --> 00:47:18,043
like running for a touchdown
and playing music at the same time.

688
00:47:18,211 --> 00:47:20,670
No one's trying to tackle you.

689
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:23,798
I don't know.
That drummer got close a few times.

690
00:47:25,218 --> 00:47:28,720
You're good. I'm surprised.

691
00:47:32,767 --> 00:47:34,309
Thanks, I guess.

692
00:47:34,477 --> 00:47:35,519
- Hey.
- Hey.

693
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:37,771
Scotty, man, good luck Friday
at the game and all that.

694
00:47:37,939 --> 00:47:40,357
Will you be at the diner tonight?

695
00:47:40,525 --> 00:47:42,901
- I'm gonna come over with my folks.
- Yeah.

696
00:47:43,069 --> 00:47:44,110
Yeah?

697
00:47:44,278 --> 00:47:46,112
Yeah. Make sure you sit
in my section.

698
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:48,698
Yeah, I will. Cool.

699
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:50,659
Yeah, okay.

700
00:47:50,826 --> 00:47:52,869
- Great.
- Bye. Scott.

701
00:47:53,037 --> 00:47:55,455
- See you.
- See you later.

702
00:47:58,793 --> 00:48:00,669
Is that your high school flame?

703
00:48:02,797 --> 00:48:05,382
Why do you care?

704
00:48:05,550 --> 00:48:07,425
I...

705
00:48:07,593 --> 00:48:11,137
I thought you worked at the hospital
in Celina today.

706
00:48:11,305 --> 00:48:15,100
The hospital is volunteer

707
00:48:15,268 --> 00:48:17,477
and the diner pays, so I...

708
00:48:17,645 --> 00:48:20,313
how did you know
I worked at the hospital?

709
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:24,276
Small town.

710
00:48:24,443 --> 00:48:26,444
Hey.

711
00:48:26,612 --> 00:48:28,113
We gotta go to work. Let's go.

712
00:48:28,281 --> 00:48:30,699
- All right.
- Okay.

713
00:48:30,866 --> 00:48:32,367
- See you.
- Yeah.

714
00:48:44,171 --> 00:48:46,339
Gig's mom called
Psychic Friends yesterday,

715
00:48:46,507 --> 00:48:48,341
said they thought we might
score a touchdown.

716
00:48:48,509 --> 00:48:50,135
Where? At Ohio Stadium?

717
00:48:50,303 --> 00:48:52,178
Oh, right,
we're not playing there.

718
00:48:52,346 --> 00:48:54,222
I just need to have
a good game,

719
00:48:54,390 --> 00:48:56,850
which I can't do unless you do.
No pressure.

720
00:48:57,018 --> 00:48:58,560
I'm sure you will.

721
00:48:58,728 --> 00:49:00,186
I hope so.

722
00:49:00,354 --> 00:49:02,522
The last thing I want to do
is spend the rest of my life

723
00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:05,191
here in Backwater

724
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:06,943
doing this stuff.

725
00:49:07,111 --> 00:49:09,404
I'd freaking kill myself.

726
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:21,041
Hey, Mom.

727
00:49:24,378 --> 00:49:27,839
If you had a chance
to do it all over again...

728
00:49:28,007 --> 00:49:30,967
your whole life...

729
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:33,219
what would you do?

730
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:36,097
I don't know.
Finish high school.

731
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:39,726
No, I'm serious.

732
00:49:39,894 --> 00:49:42,479
You would probably get
a different job, right?

733
00:49:42,647 --> 00:49:44,397
Live in a different town,
work less hours?

734
00:49:44,565 --> 00:49:46,358
No, my job is fine
and so is this town.

735
00:49:46,525 --> 00:49:49,069
Would you please
just eat your dinner?

736
00:49:49,236 --> 00:49:51,237
What's the matter with you?

737
00:49:56,577 --> 00:49:58,203
What about Dad?

738
00:49:59,205 --> 00:50:01,206
What about him?

739
00:50:03,584 --> 00:50:05,752
Would you still have
married him?

740
00:50:07,421 --> 00:50:09,255
What are you talking about?

741
00:50:10,257 --> 00:50:12,676
Would you still have
married him,

742
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:15,637
you know, even if

743
00:50:15,805 --> 00:50:18,223
you knew it wasn't gonna
work out?

744
00:50:23,312 --> 00:50:25,271
Of course.

do you think you're going?

760
00:51:23,831 --> 00:51:25,206
The library is that way.

761
00:51:25,374 --> 00:51:27,876
Guys, this is a public venue
and I've got the legal right

762
00:51:28,043 --> 00:51:29,502
to be here under
Civil Code section 47...

763
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:31,337
Sorry, freshman,
you were banned

764
00:51:31,505 --> 00:51:33,673
under the penalty
of extreme bodily pain.

765
00:51:33,841 --> 00:51:35,175
You know what? That's cool.

766
00:51:35,342 --> 00:51:37,177
You know, I really...
I wasn't even that hungry anyway.

767
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:39,220
And I was just coming in
for a sundae. I'm gonna go.

768
00:51:39,388 --> 00:51:41,264
- What's going on?
- Oh, no.

769
00:51:41,432 --> 00:51:44,184
Todd the Rod
tried to break the ban.

770
00:51:44,351 --> 00:51:46,519
Listen, I wasn't sure
if that applied to all nights

771
00:51:46,687 --> 00:51:48,563
or if it was just a weekends thing,
but now I know.

772
00:51:48,731 --> 00:51:50,106
Who banned him?

773
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:53,818
Who the hell banned him?

774
00:51:53,986 --> 00:51:55,695
You did, man.

775
00:51:59,325 --> 00:52:01,159
Yeah, well, he's unbanned now.

776
00:52:01,327 --> 00:52:03,495
He's helping me out with something,
so leave him alone.

777
00:52:03,662 --> 00:52:05,789
Let's go, Todd.

778
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:08,625
See you, ladies.

779
00:52:13,589 --> 00:52:15,632
Yo, 86 chicken fried steak.

780
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:17,175
Hi, Scotty.

781
00:52:17,343 --> 00:52:18,718
Hey.

782
00:52:18,886 --> 00:52:20,386
Right here.

783
00:52:25,226 --> 00:52:28,394
Make that milkshake extra wet.

784
00:52:29,563 --> 00:52:31,231
You seriously want
to eat with me?

785
00:52:31,398 --> 00:52:32,982
Yeah. Get what you want.

786
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:36,110
If I remember correctly,
you get free ice cream.

787
00:52:36,278 --> 00:52:38,696
No. I can't.

788
00:52:38,864 --> 00:52:41,241
I'm allergic to milk.

789
00:52:41,408 --> 00:52:43,076
If you're allergic to milk,

790
00:52:43,244 --> 00:52:45,578
why would you risk your life
coming here for a sundae?

791
00:52:45,746 --> 00:52:47,956
Move it, pixies.
We're working here.

792
00:52:48,123 --> 00:52:50,124
Well...

793
00:52:50,292 --> 00:52:52,460
I need two fries on a rail.

794
00:52:55,673 --> 00:52:56,798
You like Sasha?

795
00:52:56,966 --> 00:52:59,926
What? No. No.

796
00:53:00,094 --> 00:53:01,803
That's crazy.

797
00:53:01,971 --> 00:53:03,972
At least you don't have to worry
about any competition.

798
00:53:04,139 --> 00:53:05,306
Hey, Sasha.

799
00:53:05,474 --> 00:53:07,350
Shut it, lawn jockey.
You're not in my section.

800
00:53:07,518 --> 00:53:08,935
Hey, what are you doing, man?

801
00:53:09,103 --> 00:53:10,687
Beth, your section is bugging me.
Take care of them.

802
00:53:10,855 --> 00:53:12,313
The direct approach
does not work with her.

803
00:53:12,481 --> 00:53:14,816
I promise you, your way is gonna take
at least 20 years.

804
00:53:14,984 --> 00:53:17,110
- Sasha.
- No, no, no, please.

805
00:53:17,278 --> 00:53:19,612
- Sasha. Sasha.
- Please don't. Don't.

806
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:22,448
I didn't come here
to talk to her.

807
00:53:22,616 --> 00:53:24,576
Well, then why the hell
are you here?

808
00:53:24,743 --> 00:53:26,619
I don't know. Just...

809
00:53:26,787 --> 00:53:29,122
just to watch her, I guess.

810
00:53:34,211 --> 00:53:36,337
Listen, I heard that
some of the diner girls

811
00:53:36,505 --> 00:53:38,673
go to Butler Pond
and skinny-dip after work.

812
00:53:38,841 --> 00:53:41,301
Yeah, well, Martha Lotte and Beth Lane
would take it off for anybody.

813
00:53:41,468 --> 00:53:44,429
- No, not them.
- Who? Sasha?

814
00:53:44,597 --> 00:53:46,472
Yeah, her and Macy Edwards.

815
00:53:48,309 --> 00:53:49,392
What?

816
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:52,478
Look, I'm into Sasha, but if you
want in, I brought binoculars.

817
00:53:52,646 --> 00:53:54,272
I heard some of
the band guys talking.

818
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:56,316
They said that Macy has
really nice...

819
00:53:58,444 --> 00:54:00,778
I'm sorry.

820
00:54:00,946 --> 00:54:03,448
- Smooth move.
- You guys doing all right?

821
00:54:05,826 --> 00:54:07,327
Oh my God.

822
00:54:07,494 --> 00:54:09,037
Psych.

823
00:54:09,204 --> 00:54:10,747
See? I told you.

824
00:54:10,915 --> 00:54:13,166
They're just sitting there.
Macy doesn't skinny-dip.

825
00:54:13,334 --> 00:54:15,585
Let's get out of here. I feel stupid
sitting here spying on them.

826
00:54:15,753 --> 00:54:17,503
Wait.

827
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:19,213
Wait a minute.

828
00:54:20,925 --> 00:54:22,508
My God, they're coming off.

829
00:54:22,676 --> 00:54:24,010
What?

830
00:54:37,733 --> 00:54:40,026
Okay, you can turn around now.

831
00:54:40,194 --> 00:54:42,278
This is so awesome.

832
00:54:43,781 --> 00:54:45,657
Is that Scott?

833
00:54:45,824 --> 00:54:47,325
What are you doing?

834
00:54:47,493 --> 00:54:49,202
- Put your clothes on.
- But we were just...

835
00:54:49,370 --> 00:54:51,871
No buts. Get your clothes on and get out
of here before I call your parents.

836
00:54:52,039 --> 00:54:53,915
- Hey!
- Now. Go.

837
00:54:54,083 --> 00:54:56,292
- Relax, man.
- Norman.

838
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:58,878
- Macy, what are you doing?
- Swimming.

839
00:54:59,046 --> 00:55:00,338
You're naked, for God's sakes.

840
00:55:00,506 --> 00:55:02,548
Yeah, that's how
you skinny-dip, meathead.

841
00:55:04,259 --> 00:55:06,719
Macy Elaine, get out of this water
right now and put your clothes on.

842
00:55:06,887 --> 00:55:09,055
- What, are you, the swimming police?
- Hey, you, shut up.

843
00:55:09,223 --> 00:55:11,516
Macy, come on.

844
00:55:13,727 --> 00:55:15,561
What am I supposed to do...
just get out naked?

845
00:55:15,729 --> 00:55:17,313
No. God, please don't.

846
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:21,734
- You could catch a cold out here.
- Okay, I got it.

847
00:55:21,902 --> 00:55:23,778
Not to mention
it's a school night.

848
00:55:23,946 --> 00:55:26,239
Come on.

849
00:55:27,574 --> 00:55:29,242
Is this what you do
in your spare time...

850
00:55:29,410 --> 00:55:31,452
get naked together?
What the hell are you doing here?

851
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:33,621
What the hell
are you doing here?

852
00:55:33,789 --> 00:55:36,082
That's none of your business.

853
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:38,918
It's none of my business?
You show up here yelling,

854
00:55:39,086 --> 00:55:41,838
you scare our friends away,
and it's none of my business?

855
00:55:42,006 --> 00:55:45,216
Yeah, well, I happened to be
sitting with my friend Todd...

856
00:55:45,384 --> 00:55:48,094
happ...

857
00:55:48,262 --> 00:55:50,179
Todd, get out here.

858
00:55:53,892 --> 00:55:56,561
Todd, get out here now
or you die.

859
00:56:02,067 --> 00:56:04,193
Hi. Hello.

860
00:56:05,279 --> 00:56:07,030
Hello. Hi.

861
00:56:10,617 --> 00:56:14,120
Todd... Sasha. Sasha... Todd.

862
00:56:14,288 --> 00:56:17,457
I... I sat behind you
in Civics.

863
00:56:17,624 --> 00:56:20,084
You always came in at the bell
because you had gym right before

864
00:56:20,252 --> 00:56:22,211
and you had to shower.
You never had any makeup on

865
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:24,172
so I could always see
your freckles.

866
00:56:24,339 --> 00:56:26,466
And your hair was always wet,
kind of like now.

867
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:33,890
So since when do you hang out
with this bonehead?

868
00:56:34,058 --> 00:56:36,934
Oh, I... you know,
I don't even know this guy that well.

869
00:56:37,102 --> 00:56:38,978
You know, I was helping him
with some schoolwork.

870
00:56:39,146 --> 00:56:40,730
We were just studying.

871
00:56:40,898 --> 00:56:43,441
With binoculars?

872
00:56:45,444 --> 00:56:46,694
You know what? He likes Macy

873
00:56:46,862 --> 00:56:48,738
and he was afraid that she
might be skinny-dipping.

874
00:56:48,906 --> 00:56:50,823
What? He likes Sasha
and was spying on her at the diner.

875
00:56:50,991 --> 00:56:53,034
- No, I think you were spying on Macy.
- I wanted ice cream.

876
00:56:53,202 --> 00:56:55,495
- I wanted some ice cream too.
- You're lactose-intolerant.

877
00:57:03,879 --> 00:57:06,172
It's freezing!

878
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:08,508
I thought you were
supposed to be

879
00:57:08,675 --> 00:57:10,760
a big, tough football guy.

880
00:57:10,928 --> 00:57:14,013
I thought you were supposed to be
an innocent little band girl.

881
00:57:14,181 --> 00:57:17,183
- You learn something new every day.
- Now is this supposed to be fun?

882
00:57:17,351 --> 00:57:19,018
Because I feel like
we're all gonna get hypothermia.

883
00:57:19,186 --> 00:57:21,062
Oh, relax.
You'll get used to it.

884
00:57:24,108 --> 00:57:26,109
Oh, my.

885
00:57:27,694 --> 00:57:29,529
I like your binoculars.
They're really cool.

886
00:57:29,696 --> 00:57:31,781
Take your time drying those...

887
00:57:33,158 --> 00:57:35,201
so they can talk.

888
00:57:40,124 --> 00:57:42,458
Can I have these?

889
00:57:48,048 --> 00:57:50,341
I'm playing football again.

890
00:57:52,553 --> 00:57:54,720
I didn't even know
you'd stopped.

891
00:57:54,888 --> 00:57:57,223
It's all I've ever been
good at.

892
00:58:00,602 --> 00:58:02,061
That's good.

893
00:58:03,063 --> 00:58:05,565
Seems like you really enjoy it.

894
00:58:05,732 --> 00:58:07,900
More than you could ever know.

895
00:58:08,068 --> 00:58:11,070
It's what's gonna get me
out of Backwater.

896
00:58:11,238 --> 00:58:14,907
"Backwater"? You make it sound
like it's a prison or something.

897
00:58:17,202 --> 00:58:20,413
Don't tell me that you don't want
to get out of here someday.

898
00:58:20,581 --> 00:58:22,582
No.

899
00:58:24,585 --> 00:58:25,960
I love it here.

900
00:58:26,128 --> 00:58:28,212
Why? What's there to love?

901
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:31,257
So many things. Butler Pond.

902
00:58:31,425 --> 00:58:32,633
Skinny-dipping?

903
00:58:32,801 --> 00:58:34,552
Yes, skinny-dipping.

904
00:58:36,054 --> 00:58:37,930
No, not just that.

905
00:58:38,098 --> 00:58:40,766
In the winter, you know,
when it freezes over

906
00:58:40,934 --> 00:58:43,936
and they have live music

907
00:58:44,104 --> 00:58:46,939
and everyone's out there
ice skating.

908
00:58:47,107 --> 00:58:48,900
Oh, I love that.

909
00:58:49,067 --> 00:58:50,943
I go out there and I just feel

910
00:58:51,111 --> 00:58:53,613
like I'm living
in an old painting.

911
00:58:54,698 --> 00:58:58,451
This town is small enough

912
00:58:58,619 --> 00:59:02,955
that you feel like
you're one giant family, but...

913
00:59:05,459 --> 00:59:06,876
it's big enough

914
00:59:07,044 --> 00:59:11,881
that someone you thought
was one way...

915
00:59:13,675 --> 00:59:15,801
is entirely different

916
00:59:15,969 --> 00:59:18,054
once you get to know them
a little.

917
00:59:25,145 --> 00:59:28,147
And that's what I love
about Coldwater.

918
00:59:37,866 --> 00:59:40,201
Things are gonna be
different now, Macy.

919
00:59:42,162 --> 00:59:43,704
I'm going to college.

920
00:59:43,872 --> 00:59:46,249
And I'm gonna play football.

921
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:48,709
When I go pro, they're gonna pay me
a lot of money.

922
00:59:50,837 --> 00:59:53,881
That's great, good for you.

923
00:59:54,049 --> 00:59:57,260
No, not just good for me.
It's good for you.

924
00:59:59,054 --> 01:00:01,639
Macy, I can take you with me.

925
01:00:01,807 --> 01:00:03,641
I can get us out of here.

926
01:00:06,853 --> 01:00:09,438
Do girls really fall
for that crap?

927
01:00:10,774 --> 01:00:13,859
Here.

928
01:00:14,027 --> 01:00:15,611
Gosh, I guess
you get used to it.

929
01:00:15,779 --> 01:00:17,530
What? Used to what?

930
01:00:17,698 --> 01:00:19,031
Everything coming so easy.

931
01:00:19,199 --> 01:00:21,701
Nothing in my life
has ever come easy.

932
01:00:21,868 --> 01:00:24,203
What do you want, Macy?
You want to live out of a trailer,

933
01:00:24,371 --> 01:00:27,290
barely scraping by here in Coldwater
the rest of your life?

934
01:00:29,251 --> 01:00:31,168
I'm...

935
01:00:32,421 --> 01:00:34,088
who cares where I live?

936
01:00:34,256 --> 01:00:35,715
And you know what?

937
01:00:35,882 --> 01:00:38,551
If I do, God forbid,
end up in a trailer,

938
01:00:38,719 --> 01:00:41,887
then I'm sure I'm gonna be
a lot happier than you are

939
01:00:42,055 --> 01:00:45,266
in some big mansion.

940
01:00:45,434 --> 01:00:47,184
Hey, I wouldn't bet on it.

941
01:00:47,352 --> 01:00:49,020
- See you.
- Sasha, can we go?

942
01:00:49,187 --> 01:00:51,564
In fact, I'm pretty positive
we're gonna be quite miserable.

943
01:00:51,732 --> 01:00:54,025
- Loser.
- Wait. Wait. I'm not with him.

944
01:00:54,192 --> 01:00:56,068
I mean, we're not
really friends.

945
01:00:56,236 --> 01:00:58,029
Todd.

946
01:01:05,287 --> 01:01:07,413
Who the hell
does she think she is?

947
01:01:07,581 --> 01:01:10,916
I mean, besides,
I have the prettiest girlfriend

948
01:01:11,084 --> 01:01:12,877
in town, in the state... Jenny.

949
01:01:13,045 --> 01:01:15,338
She's beautiful.
She's smart. She's amazing.

950
01:01:15,505 --> 01:01:18,424
She's... she's coordinated.

951
01:01:18,592 --> 01:01:20,926
You know, we were naked
in the same water.

952
01:01:21,094 --> 01:01:23,554
All I've ever wanted to do
was play football.

953
01:01:23,722 --> 01:01:27,141
And now I have a chance to do it again
and I'm not giving it up.

954
01:01:27,309 --> 01:01:29,310
That means the water
that touched her naked

955
01:01:29,478 --> 01:01:31,395
touched me naked.

956
01:01:31,563 --> 01:01:34,857
I'm getting out of here, Todd.
I don't care what it takes.

957
01:01:41,156 --> 01:01:43,616
So what do you want to do?

958
01:01:43,784 --> 01:01:47,703
Well, maybe we could
get some ice cream.

959
01:01:47,871 --> 01:01:49,872
I don't know.

960
01:01:50,957 --> 01:01:53,459
Red 18! Red 18! Hike!

961
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:00,800
Murph, man, what the hell
just happened?

962
01:02:00,967 --> 01:02:02,385
- Come on, Gig.
- Why the hell did you throw it to me?

963
01:02:02,552 --> 01:02:03,677
You don't never throw it to me.

964
01:02:03,845 --> 01:02:04,970
Relax, Gig.
You'll catch one someday.

965
01:02:05,138 --> 01:02:06,931
Since when does he start
throwing it to me, man?

966
01:02:07,099 --> 01:02:08,891
I signed up for the ladies,
not to get hit.

967
01:02:25,659 --> 01:02:27,743
- Hey, Mom.
- Sit down.

968
01:02:27,911 --> 01:02:29,078
Sit!

969
01:02:30,914 --> 01:02:32,415
Is everything okay?

970
01:02:32,582 --> 01:02:34,625
I put in 14 hours last night,

971
01:02:34,793 --> 01:02:37,294
only to be woken up
by Todd White's mother

972
01:02:37,462 --> 01:02:39,755
telling me how you are
tormenting her son now

973
01:02:39,923 --> 01:02:42,591
and keeping him up all hours
of the night. Is that right?

974
01:02:42,759 --> 01:02:45,511
- Well, it wasn't quite like that.
- I don't care what it was like.

975
01:02:45,679 --> 01:02:48,097
I raised you better than this.
You're grounded, buster.

976
01:02:48,265 --> 01:02:50,558
- I'm grounded?
- Oh, this is funny to you?

977
01:02:50,725 --> 01:02:52,560
You are grounded,
do you hear me?

978
01:02:52,727 --> 01:02:54,395
- Hey, Thelma. Sorry I'm...
- Grounded.

979
01:02:54,563 --> 01:02:57,565
- Listen, I'll come right back.
- No, no, no. Actually, I'm done.

980
01:02:57,732 --> 01:03:00,693
It's your turn. Maybe you can
talk some sense into him.

981
01:03:00,861 --> 01:03:02,194
I doubt it, but I'll try.

982
01:03:02,362 --> 01:03:05,364
You'd better do more than that,
or you're both grounded.

983
01:03:08,076 --> 01:03:09,702
All right, what did you do?

984
01:03:10,704 --> 01:03:12,121
Nothing.

985
01:03:12,289 --> 01:03:14,039
What's this?

986
01:03:14,207 --> 01:03:16,041
Double-shift Wednesdays.

987
01:03:16,209 --> 01:03:18,961
Since you're grounded, I don't think
you got anything better to do.

988
01:03:19,129 --> 01:03:21,005
I forgot we did this.

989
01:03:22,716 --> 01:03:24,425
All right.

990
01:03:24,593 --> 01:03:27,136
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

991
01:03:27,304 --> 01:03:29,305
They're both for you.

992
01:03:31,475 --> 01:03:33,350
I'm pretty good at opening
those myself

993
01:03:33,518 --> 01:03:36,020
and usually one at a time.

994
01:03:36,188 --> 01:03:38,689
All right, grab some plates.

995
01:03:38,857 --> 01:03:40,733
- How did it go with Crystal?
- Oh, it was great.

996
01:03:40,901 --> 01:03:43,986
We talked her out of her depression
and back into her rut.

997
01:03:45,572 --> 01:03:47,740
Coach Cooper said
I could start next year.

998
01:03:47,908 --> 01:03:49,909
That means I can go pro sooner.

999
01:03:50,076 --> 01:03:52,286
Finish school.

1000
01:03:52,454 --> 01:03:54,580
I can finish school
when I retire.

1001
01:03:54,748 --> 01:03:58,125
I just gotta start making money
so my mom could quit working so much.

1002
01:03:58,293 --> 01:04:00,169
I got my full ride out of here.

1003
01:04:00,337 --> 01:04:02,379
I just want to make sure
I get her out of Backwater too.

1004
01:04:02,547 --> 01:04:05,049
What have I told you
about that?

1005
01:04:06,384 --> 01:04:09,053
This town raised you.
Now show it some respect.

1006
01:04:09,221 --> 01:04:11,096
It's Coldwater with a "C."

1007
01:04:11,264 --> 01:04:13,349
I'm just saying
I could get her out of here.

1008
01:04:13,517 --> 01:04:16,101
And I could get you out of here too
if you want.

1009
01:04:16,269 --> 01:04:18,646
I'm fine right where I am.

1010
01:04:18,813 --> 01:04:20,272
No, I'm serious.

1011
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:22,399
I could ask Ohio State
to hire you

1012
01:04:22,567 --> 01:04:24,818
as offensive coordinator
or quarterback coach.

1013
01:04:26,613 --> 01:04:29,782
Well, I appreciate that,
"Big Time."

1014
01:04:29,950 --> 01:04:32,243
Really I do.

1015
01:04:33,954 --> 01:04:35,621
But the truth is

1016
01:04:35,789 --> 01:04:38,374
Ohio State's already
offered me a job.

1017
01:04:40,085 --> 01:04:42,795
What? When?

1018
01:04:44,172 --> 01:04:46,632
Well, let's see...

1019
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:49,843
'83, when they wanted Yeager

1020
01:04:50,011 --> 01:04:52,555
and then '84
when we won the sectionals

1021
01:04:52,722 --> 01:04:56,642
and, yeah, pretty much
every year since then.

1022
01:04:57,811 --> 01:04:59,812
How come you didn't take it?

1023
01:05:04,317 --> 01:05:07,278
They got plenty of coaches
at Ohio State.

1024
01:05:09,406 --> 01:05:11,532
Did you finish
all your homework tonight?

1025
01:05:12,534 --> 01:05:14,159
Forget about it.

1026
01:05:14,327 --> 01:05:17,329
You know, when I was your age

1027
01:05:17,497 --> 01:05:19,665
I really was just like you.

1028
01:05:19,833 --> 01:05:22,585
I couldn't wait
to leave this town.

1029
01:05:22,752 --> 01:05:25,713
Then when I finally did
get out,

1030
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:28,007
saw what I saw

1031
01:05:28,174 --> 01:05:31,010
and did what I did,

1032
01:05:31,177 --> 01:05:33,012
well, I...

1033
01:05:33,179 --> 01:05:35,973
I couldn't run back here
fast enough.

1034
01:05:41,187 --> 01:05:44,315
You know, Scott,

1035
01:05:44,482 --> 01:05:47,776
this little town

1036
01:05:47,944 --> 01:05:50,237
really is special.

1037
01:05:51,781 --> 01:05:54,158
One day I hope
you realize that.

1038
01:05:56,703 --> 01:05:58,370
See you tomorrow, son.

1039
01:06:07,589 --> 01:06:09,632
Game's gonna be on TV, boys.

1040
01:06:10,717 --> 01:06:13,344
The "Sports Illustrated" guy
came in this morning.

1041
01:06:13,511 --> 01:06:15,387
Would you sign the petition?

1042
01:06:15,555 --> 01:06:16,764
It's for the band.

1043
01:06:16,931 --> 01:06:19,600
My gosh.

1044
01:06:19,768 --> 01:06:21,352
Look out.

1045
01:06:21,519 --> 01:06:22,895
I am so sorry.

1046
01:06:23,063 --> 01:06:26,357
Hey, while I have you,

1047
01:06:26,524 --> 01:06:28,525
would you sign?
It's for the band.

1048
01:06:28,693 --> 01:06:30,569
Drop dead.

1049
01:06:34,908 --> 01:06:37,951
Hey, thanks.

1050
01:06:40,038 --> 01:06:42,414
- I've got it.
- What are you doing?

1051
01:06:42,582 --> 01:06:44,875
Oh, it's just a petition...

1052
01:06:45,043 --> 01:06:47,086
you know,
trying to save the band.

1053
01:06:47,253 --> 01:06:49,338
How many do you have?

1054
01:06:49,506 --> 01:06:52,174
I have four.

1055
01:06:52,342 --> 01:06:54,259
What, pages?

1056
01:06:54,427 --> 01:06:57,262
No. No, like, people.

1057
01:06:57,430 --> 01:07:00,724
The band's not quite as popular

1058
01:07:00,892 --> 01:07:02,893
as football, so...

1059
01:07:03,978 --> 01:07:05,521
Oh, thanks.

1060
01:07:05,689 --> 01:07:08,565
Hey, save the band.
Save the band.

1061
01:07:08,733 --> 01:07:10,609
Everybody sign this.

1062
01:07:10,777 --> 01:07:12,611
- Save the band.
- Save the band.

1063
01:07:12,779 --> 01:07:14,488
Everybody pass one around,
sign it.

1064
01:07:14,656 --> 01:07:16,365
The football team can't play
without the band.

1065
01:07:16,533 --> 01:07:18,617
- Scotty wants us to save the band.
- Take one right there.

1066
01:07:18,785 --> 01:07:20,869
Sign it. Pass one around.

1067
01:07:21,037 --> 01:07:22,788
You guys got one
right over here?

1068
01:07:22,956 --> 01:07:25,791
Hey, there's some more.
Pass them around.

1069
01:07:25,959 --> 01:07:28,210
The football team can't play
without the band.

1070
01:07:32,757 --> 01:07:34,258
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

1071
01:07:34,426 --> 01:07:36,802
Scotty.

1072
01:07:36,970 --> 01:07:39,138
What are you doing?

1073
01:07:40,140 --> 01:07:42,307
Come on, let's go.

1074
01:07:42,475 --> 01:07:44,560
Great. Thank you.

1075
01:08:00,118 --> 01:08:01,493
And because of that,

1076
01:08:01,661 --> 01:08:04,121
they've got the number one
secondary in the nation.

1077
01:08:04,289 --> 01:08:06,665
Eight of their starting
11 defensemen

1078
01:08:06,833 --> 01:08:09,001
all have full rides
to D1 schools.

1079
01:08:09,169 --> 01:08:10,753
For all intents
and purposes, guys,

1080
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:13,005
you're playing a college team
Friday...

1081
01:08:13,173 --> 01:08:15,007
a pretty good one.

1082
01:08:15,175 --> 01:08:17,468
And they hit hard.

1083
01:08:17,635 --> 01:08:20,179
They're gonna try and do
everything they can

1084
01:08:20,346 --> 01:08:22,389
to get Scott Murphy
out of the game.

1085
01:08:22,557 --> 01:08:24,308
It goes without saying, boys,

1086
01:08:24,476 --> 01:08:27,352
we've got to protect
our quarterback.

1087
01:08:29,564 --> 01:08:32,900
But it's gonna be our field.

1088
01:08:34,402 --> 01:08:37,404
If we play together,

1089
01:08:37,572 --> 01:08:39,865
I think we can beat these guys.

1090
01:08:41,576 --> 01:08:44,369
Now go home, tell your parents
you love them, and get some sleep.

1091
01:08:44,537 --> 01:08:46,038
What about practice?

1092
01:08:47,123 --> 01:08:48,832
That was practice.

1093
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:03,222
Oh, here you go.

1094
01:09:03,389 --> 01:09:07,226
So I heard Penn State and Notre Dame
are still coming around.

1095
01:09:07,393 --> 01:09:10,062
I hope you're still excited
about being a Buckeye.

1096
01:09:10,230 --> 01:09:11,647
Yes.

1097
01:09:11,815 --> 01:09:13,899
I'm definitely going
to Ohio State.

1098
01:09:14,067 --> 01:09:16,276
I want to be close to my mom.

1099
01:09:16,444 --> 01:09:17,569
Aww.

1100
01:09:17,737 --> 01:09:19,571
Well, let me just
thank Thelma now

1101
01:09:19,739 --> 01:09:21,114
for keeping her son
close to home.

1102
01:09:21,282 --> 01:09:22,866
You don't have to go
nowhere for me.

1103
01:09:23,034 --> 01:09:25,494
Go where you want to go, okay?

1104
01:09:25,662 --> 01:09:27,037
Yeah, but don't you want him
in Columbus

1105
01:09:27,205 --> 01:09:28,997
so you can come see him play?

1106
01:09:32,752 --> 01:09:35,754
She doesn't watch his games.
She's never seen him play.

1107
01:09:38,258 --> 01:09:39,633
You've never seen him play?

1108
01:09:39,801 --> 01:09:41,844
She works nights.

1109
01:09:42,011 --> 01:09:44,346
Well, Thelma,
you gotta come see him play,

1110
01:09:44,514 --> 01:09:46,890
'cause he will make you
so proud.

1111
01:09:48,059 --> 01:09:50,686
I'm already proud of him.

1112
01:09:55,733 --> 01:09:58,277
Pass the pepper, please.

1113
01:10:02,115 --> 01:10:03,782
Thank your mom for me again,
would you?

1114
01:10:03,950 --> 01:10:05,409
Yeah.

1115
01:10:05,577 --> 01:10:07,828
Do me a favor,

1116
01:10:07,996 --> 01:10:10,247
take it easy on Cuyahoga
tomorrow night, all right?

1117
01:10:10,415 --> 01:10:12,749
Some of those guys are gonna be
your future teammates.

1118
01:10:12,917 --> 01:10:15,210
I was kind of hoping
they would take it easy on me.

1119
01:10:15,378 --> 01:10:17,421
Yeah, me too.

1120
01:10:17,589 --> 01:10:19,798
Listen, your linemen...
they play hard.

1121
01:10:19,966 --> 01:10:22,175
They do. They...
and they play with heart.

1122
01:10:22,343 --> 01:10:24,303
But, son, they're not gonna be able
to protect you

1123
01:10:24,470 --> 01:10:26,555
worth a damn tomorrow night.

1124
01:10:26,723 --> 01:10:28,724
Yeah, I know.

1125
01:10:29,726 --> 01:10:31,268
Listen to me.

1126
01:10:31,436 --> 01:10:33,312
We are sold on you.

1127
01:10:33,479 --> 01:10:35,647
We don't need to see you play
any more football.

1128
01:10:35,815 --> 01:10:38,692
And if you want to sit this game out
tomorrow night,

1129
01:10:38,860 --> 01:10:41,695
we're not gonna
fault you for it one bit.

1130
01:10:45,700 --> 01:10:48,368
Thanks again.
And whatever you decide,

1131
01:10:48,536 --> 01:10:50,245
good luck.

1132
01:10:50,413 --> 01:10:52,164
Thanks, Coach.

1133
01:10:58,129 --> 01:11:00,464
I can't wait for us
to get out of here together.

1134
01:11:30,828 --> 01:11:33,121
Hey, Macy.

1135
01:11:34,582 --> 01:11:37,668
What are you doing here?
My dad will kill you if he sees you.

1136
01:11:37,835 --> 01:11:39,544
I really need to talk to you.

1137
01:11:39,712 --> 01:11:41,505
It's important.

1138
01:11:42,507 --> 01:11:45,050
Okay, just come in here.

1139
01:11:46,344 --> 01:11:48,261
Thanks for helping
with the petition.

1140
01:11:50,014 --> 01:11:52,057
Pretty much the whole school
signed it.

1141
01:11:52,225 --> 01:11:54,267
So I guess we're even?

1142
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:56,895
For the band room?

1143
01:11:57,063 --> 01:11:59,064
Yeah.

1144
01:12:02,276 --> 01:12:04,695
So...

1145
01:12:04,862 --> 01:12:07,322
what's so important?

1146
01:12:08,908 --> 01:12:10,909
Us.

1147
01:12:11,911 --> 01:12:13,620
What...?

1148
01:12:13,788 --> 01:12:17,207
What are you talking about?
You have a girlfriend.

1149
01:12:17,375 --> 01:12:19,543
Yeah, but I don't marry her.

1150
01:12:19,711 --> 01:12:21,294
I marry you.

1151
01:12:21,462 --> 01:12:22,587
You marry me?

1152
01:12:22,755 --> 01:12:25,090
You don't even know me.

1153
01:12:25,258 --> 01:12:27,175
I do know you, Macy,

1154
01:12:27,343 --> 01:12:29,219
better than you can
ever imagine.

1155
01:12:29,387 --> 01:12:32,597
Come on.
Did your friends put you up to this?

1156
01:12:34,559 --> 01:12:37,102
Because it is not funny.

1157
01:12:54,370 --> 01:12:56,747
Your grandma had a cabin
in Manns Choice.

1158
01:12:56,914 --> 01:12:58,915
You two had a game...

1159
01:12:59,083 --> 01:13:00,959
so that if you make your wish,

1160
01:13:01,127 --> 01:13:03,503
you roll it up in a piece of paper
and you put it in the wall...

1161
01:13:03,671 --> 01:13:05,797
all your wishes come true.

1162
01:13:07,675 --> 01:13:09,801
Every year, you wished
for the same thing.

1163
01:13:09,969 --> 01:13:12,304
When you were 14,
she passed away.

1164
01:13:12,472 --> 01:13:14,848
And when they were tearing
the place down

1165
01:13:15,016 --> 01:13:16,808
you came back
and you looked in the walls

1166
01:13:16,976 --> 01:13:18,727
and all your wishes were gone.

1167
01:13:18,895 --> 01:13:21,688
I know what you wish for, Macy.

1168
01:13:23,149 --> 01:13:26,151
You wish that one day
you could buy this farm

1169
01:13:26,319 --> 01:13:28,111
that you and your parents
work on.

1170
01:13:28,279 --> 01:13:31,490
Macy, your wishes come true.

1171
01:13:31,657 --> 01:13:34,743
We end up getting married
and we buy this farm.

1172
01:13:34,911 --> 01:13:36,995
And we have two little girls
named Krista and Jamie

1173
01:13:37,163 --> 01:13:39,498
- that we named after your aunts.
- Why are you doing this?

1174
01:13:39,665 --> 01:13:42,125
We end up together because
I get crippled in the game tonight.

1175
01:13:42,293 --> 01:13:44,002
- Stop it.
- But I'm gonna change things.

1176
01:13:44,170 --> 01:13:47,005
If I don't get hurt, in a few years
I'm gonna be making money

1177
01:13:47,173 --> 01:13:49,132
and I'll finally be able
to take care of you.

1178
01:13:49,300 --> 01:13:51,384
Stop it. Just stop talking

1179
01:13:51,552 --> 01:13:54,179
and please leave me alone.

1180
01:13:54,347 --> 01:13:57,516
Macy, stop.

1181
01:13:58,684 --> 01:14:01,520
We tried your dream, okay?
And it didn't work out.

1182
01:14:01,687 --> 01:14:04,689
And I'm not gonna
end up here in Coldwater

1183
01:14:04,857 --> 01:14:06,483
with a bum leg, a rundown farm

1184
01:14:06,651 --> 01:14:08,401
and two kids I can barely support.
I'm not doing it again.

1185
01:14:08,569 --> 01:14:10,946
I'm not asking you to.

1186
01:14:13,658 --> 01:14:15,700
All I'm asking

1187
01:14:15,868 --> 01:14:17,410
is for you to try my dream.

1188
01:14:18,454 --> 01:14:20,997
Come to Ohio State
with me next year.

1189
01:14:22,125 --> 01:14:24,543
What are you talking about?

1190
01:14:25,670 --> 01:14:27,712
We were an accident.

1191
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:30,215
We weren't supposed to
end up together.

1192
01:14:30,383 --> 01:14:32,884
What I'm saying is,
it doesn't have to be like that.

1193
01:14:39,392 --> 01:14:42,352
Relationships aren't accidents.

1194
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:44,771
They're decisions.

1195
01:14:44,939 --> 01:14:47,858
And if you made one

1196
01:14:48,025 --> 01:14:50,152
that you're not happy with,

1197
01:14:50,319 --> 01:14:52,654
then that is called a mistake.

1198
01:14:54,282 --> 01:14:56,950
So maybe you're better off
without it.

1199
01:14:59,787 --> 01:15:01,788
Macy?

1200
01:15:03,249 --> 01:15:06,001
Have a nice life, Scott.

1201
01:15:07,086 --> 01:15:10,213
I hope you find
what you're looking for.

1202
01:15:12,675 --> 01:15:14,926
Macy.

1203
01:15:20,641 --> 01:15:22,350
Yeah, all right,
I'll let her know.

1204
01:15:25,313 --> 01:15:27,856
Good luck tonight, Scotty.

1205
01:15:28,024 --> 01:15:29,649
There you go. Thanks a lot.

1206
01:15:29,817 --> 01:15:31,818
- Hey, Coach.
- Hey, Scotty. I have a history class.

1207
01:15:31,986 --> 01:15:33,737
- This is important.
- Well, so are they.

1208
01:15:33,905 --> 01:15:36,448
This can't wait.

1209
01:15:36,616 --> 01:15:39,451
All right, quickly. What is it?

1210
01:15:43,414 --> 01:15:45,540
I can't play tonight.

1211
01:15:45,708 --> 01:15:47,751
Oh, no. Did you hurt yourself?
What did you do?

1212
01:15:47,919 --> 01:15:49,294
No, not yet.

1213
01:15:49,462 --> 01:15:51,004
- You're not hurt?
- No, I'm not hurt,

1214
01:15:51,172 --> 01:15:54,257
but if I get injured,
I could lose my scholarship.

1215
01:15:56,844 --> 01:16:00,138
You're not playing because
you're afraid you might get hurt?

1216
01:16:00,306 --> 01:16:03,183
Come on, Coach. We're too small
to be playing these guys.

1217
01:16:03,351 --> 01:16:05,227
Everyone knows it.
Even you said it.

1218
01:16:07,146 --> 01:16:09,940
Oh, well...

1219
01:16:10,107 --> 01:16:12,317
what the hell
has happened to you?

1220
01:16:12,485 --> 01:16:14,861
Two weeks ago,
if I had told you

1221
01:16:15,029 --> 01:16:17,781
we were playing the Cincinnati Bengals,
you'd have felt sorry for them

1222
01:16:17,949 --> 01:16:19,658
because of the beating you thought
you were gonna give them.

1223
01:16:19,825 --> 01:16:22,369
And now you're telling me that we're
too small, so you're quitting?

1224
01:16:23,829 --> 01:16:24,829
I have to.

1225
01:16:24,997 --> 01:16:26,998
Well, what is it you want from me?
"That's fine,

1226
01:16:27,166 --> 01:16:29,334
I understand, son.
The team will be great"?

1227
01:16:29,502 --> 01:16:32,128
I'm not throwing my life away
for some high school football game.

1228
01:16:32,296 --> 01:16:34,172
Coach, come on,
I have a future.

1229
01:16:34,340 --> 01:16:36,341
Do you know
what the future is, Scott?

1230
01:16:36,509 --> 01:16:40,303
The future is just a bunch of
what you do right now strung together.

1231
01:16:40,471 --> 01:16:42,639
And right now all you're doing
is giving up.

1232
01:16:42,807 --> 01:16:44,933
And trust me,
there's no future in that.

1233
01:16:47,979 --> 01:16:49,980
Scott...

1234
01:16:51,107 --> 01:16:53,984
I hope you don't give up
this easy in life,

1235
01:16:54,151 --> 01:16:57,529
because it gets a hell of a lot
harder than football.

1236
01:17:10,793 --> 01:17:12,794
They're here.

1237
01:17:14,547 --> 01:17:17,299
Lord, look at the size
of their linemen.

1238
01:17:17,466 --> 01:17:19,551
That's a quarterback.

1239
01:17:19,719 --> 01:17:21,511
That is their lineman.

1240
01:17:22,722 --> 01:17:25,557
Oh, jeez, they're all that big.

1241
01:17:25,725 --> 01:17:28,059
Have fun with them tonight.

1242
01:17:29,937 --> 01:17:31,521
Damn.

1243
01:17:51,375 --> 01:17:54,002
Your Ohio State jersey.

1244
01:17:54,170 --> 01:17:56,546
Do you like it?

1245
01:17:56,714 --> 01:17:58,757
Yeah.

1246
01:17:58,924 --> 01:18:00,884
I do.

1247
01:18:01,052 --> 01:18:03,053
Thanks.

1248
01:18:06,974 --> 01:18:09,517
Stop worrying about it.

1249
01:18:09,685 --> 01:18:11,770
If there's even a remote chance
that you'll get hurt,

1250
01:18:11,937 --> 01:18:13,396
don't play, end of story.

1251
01:18:13,564 --> 01:18:16,399
I know. I just feel like
I'm letting the whole town down.

1252
01:18:16,567 --> 01:18:18,443
Forget about right now.

1253
01:18:18,611 --> 01:18:21,905
Think about your future, okay?

1254
01:18:22,073 --> 01:18:23,948
I know you, Scotty.

1255
01:18:24,116 --> 01:18:26,493
All you've ever wanted is
to take care of everybody, right?

1256
01:18:26,660 --> 01:18:29,204
- Right.
- Okay, so when you go pro,

1257
01:18:29,372 --> 01:18:31,623
you'll have enough money
to do that.

1258
01:18:31,791 --> 01:18:34,167
No more night shifts
and double shifts for your mom,

1259
01:18:34,335 --> 01:18:37,754
no more trailer.
You can get her a real house.

1260
01:18:41,926 --> 01:18:43,301
You're right.

1261
01:18:43,469 --> 01:18:45,553
You should get used to that.

1262
01:19:07,159 --> 01:19:09,702
- Sit down. I bought you dinner.
- Are you crazy?

1263
01:19:09,870 --> 01:19:11,329
- Sit down.
- I don't have a lot of time.

1264
01:19:11,497 --> 01:19:13,456
Yes, you do.
You have plenty of time.

1265
01:19:13,624 --> 01:19:16,668
Wait, wait, don't you have
a game tonight?

1266
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:19,921
I'm not playing.

1267
01:19:21,966 --> 01:19:23,341
You're not?

1268
01:19:23,509 --> 01:19:25,677
Things are gonna be
different now, Mom.

1269
01:19:25,845 --> 01:19:28,513
From this point on,
I'm gonna be taking care of you.

1270
01:19:28,681 --> 01:19:31,474
No, you just take care of yourself.
I'm fine.

1271
01:19:31,642 --> 01:19:34,686
No, I'm serious. Next year,
I can start living cheaply.

1272
01:19:34,854 --> 01:19:36,729
I'll start sending you
some of my scholarship money.

1273
01:19:36,897 --> 01:19:38,648
No, you save your money.
I don't need it.

1274
01:19:38,816 --> 01:19:40,608
And the truck... I mean,
it's a beautiful truck,

1275
01:19:40,776 --> 01:19:42,193
but why don't we sell it?

1276
01:19:42,361 --> 01:19:45,029
- I can get a ride or run to school.
- Sell it? I just bought that truck.

1277
01:19:45,197 --> 01:19:47,740
- You can buy yourself a new car.
- I don't need a new car.

1278
01:19:47,908 --> 01:19:50,702
And I don't need you telling me
how to manage my money, so lay off.

1279
01:19:50,870 --> 01:19:52,328
I don't need it. It's a waste.

1280
01:19:52,496 --> 01:19:55,832
Hey, some people spend their money
on fancy trips.

1281
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:59,002
Some people go gambling.
I like to spend my money...

1282
01:19:59,170 --> 01:20:01,546
and I ain't got much... on you.

1283
01:20:01,714 --> 01:20:03,798
You didn't have a lot growing up
and you never complained,

1284
01:20:03,966 --> 01:20:07,302
so I want you to have
something nice, okay?

1285
01:20:07,470 --> 01:20:10,388
And that truck is gonna
take care of you for a long time,

1286
01:20:10,556 --> 01:20:12,474
so just stop this talk.

1287
01:20:12,641 --> 01:20:14,058
"Sell the truck."

1288
01:20:14,226 --> 01:20:16,561
I'd rather you buy something
for yourself,

1289
01:20:16,729 --> 01:20:18,521
take a vacation or something.

1290
01:20:18,689 --> 01:20:22,025
Things don't make me happy.
Vacations don't make me happy.

1291
01:20:23,736 --> 01:20:25,945
You being happy makes me happy.

1292
01:20:26,113 --> 01:20:28,656
I am gonna be happy.
And things are gonna be different.

1293
01:20:28,824 --> 01:20:31,534
Gonna be?
What is so wrong with right now?

1294
01:20:31,702 --> 01:20:34,162
What if this is
all you get, kid?

1295
01:20:34,330 --> 01:20:36,331
What if this is it?

1296
01:20:44,006 --> 01:20:46,508
It just...

1297
01:20:46,675 --> 01:20:50,094
it just seems like nothing is ever
enough with you, you know?

1298
01:20:51,430 --> 01:20:55,350
And if you can't be satisfied
with what you got,

1299
01:20:55,518 --> 01:20:57,644
then you're never
gonna be happy,

1300
01:20:57,811 --> 01:20:59,812
no matter what you get.

1301
01:21:06,529 --> 01:21:08,404
You asked me before

1302
01:21:08,572 --> 01:21:11,574
if there was something
I wish was different.

1303
01:21:13,953 --> 01:21:17,080
If there was one thing
I could change,

1304
01:21:17,248 --> 01:21:20,041
that would be it.

1305
01:21:20,209 --> 01:21:22,961
I just want to make you
proud of me.

1306
01:21:25,756 --> 01:21:28,091
You want to make me proud?

1307
01:21:29,843 --> 01:21:32,011
Make yourself proud.

1308
01:21:32,179 --> 01:21:34,556
And I'm not talking
to "Mr. Football" here.

1309
01:21:36,642 --> 01:21:39,018
I'm talking to Scott Murphy.

1310
01:22:29,612 --> 01:22:31,613
Sorry I'm late.

1311
01:22:40,372 --> 01:22:41,539
Get dressed.

1312
01:22:48,172 --> 01:22:49,756
Hello, everybody, and welcome

1313
01:22:49,923 --> 01:22:51,883
to the Ohio State championship
football game.

1314
01:22:52,051 --> 01:22:54,177
This is a true
David vs. Goliath story.

1315
01:22:54,345 --> 01:22:56,220
There are 2,700 people

1316
01:22:56,388 --> 01:22:58,681
in the blue collar community
of Coldwater, Ohio,

1317
01:22:58,849 --> 01:23:01,142
all packed into this
small-town stadium

1318
01:23:01,310 --> 01:23:03,061
to watch their home team
face off

1319
01:23:03,228 --> 01:23:06,773
against the defending state champion
Cuyahoga Red Raiders...

1320
01:23:06,940 --> 01:23:09,108
a team from a high school
with more students

1321
01:23:09,276 --> 01:23:12,403
than this small town's
entire population.

1322
01:23:13,405 --> 01:23:16,574
I know that all week long
you've been talking about losing,

1323
01:23:16,742 --> 01:23:19,202
thinking about losing.

1324
01:23:19,370 --> 01:23:21,954
Some of you are wondering if you should
even be playing in this game.

1325
01:23:22,122 --> 01:23:24,207
Hell, there's probably
an accountant somewhere

1326
01:23:24,375 --> 01:23:26,292
thinks a school our size
isn't worth it...

1327
01:23:26,460 --> 01:23:27,752
I mean, we don't have a chance.

1328
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:30,630
Those guys over there think
we don't even belong on the same field,

1329
01:23:30,798 --> 01:23:34,217
but somebody thinks they're worth
an air-conditioned tour bus.

1330
01:23:35,594 --> 01:23:38,262
I want you
to go out there tonight

1331
01:23:38,430 --> 01:23:41,182
and show everybody
it isn't the size of your bodies,

1332
01:23:41,350 --> 01:23:44,268
the size of your buses
or your school that matters.

1333
01:23:44,436 --> 01:23:47,730
It's the size of something else
that wins football games.

1334
01:23:47,898 --> 01:23:50,650
- One, two, three...
- Coldwater!

1335
01:23:53,946 --> 01:23:55,863
Now taking the field,

1336
01:23:56,031 --> 01:23:59,742
the Coldwater Black Bears!

1337
01:24:03,122 --> 01:24:05,832
- Ready to make history?
- Change it at least.

1338
01:24:22,516 --> 01:24:24,392
After the game, you're mine.

1339
01:24:25,436 --> 01:24:27,812
Go Bears!

1340
01:24:29,982 --> 01:24:32,316
Let's do this.
Come on, let's go.

1341
01:24:32,484 --> 01:24:35,361
- One, two, three...
- Red Raiders rule!

1342
01:24:37,823 --> 01:24:39,866
Jablonsky, deep to return

1343
01:24:40,033 --> 01:24:42,118
in the white jersey
and the red pants.

1344
01:24:42,286 --> 01:24:44,495
And he'll take it right side
at his own goal line.

1345
01:24:44,663 --> 01:24:46,414
He's up to the five
with a wall,

1346
01:24:46,582 --> 01:24:48,291
to the 10, to the 15,
to the 20,

1347
01:24:48,459 --> 01:24:50,001
to the 25, 30,

1348
01:24:50,169 --> 01:24:52,211
35, 40. Do you believe it?

1349
01:24:52,379 --> 01:24:55,923
This isn't what Coach Hand
wanted to see.

1350
01:24:56,091 --> 01:24:57,967
That is going all the way.

1351
01:24:58,135 --> 01:25:01,137
Touchdown, Cuyahoga!

1352
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:06,684
Right there. Good job.

1353
01:25:06,852 --> 01:25:10,354
Coldwater's shocked
with that Jablonsky kickoff return.

1354
01:25:10,522 --> 01:25:11,898
They're down seven-zip.

1355
01:25:12,065 --> 01:25:14,358
- All right, let's get that right back.
- And the story here tonight

1356
01:25:14,526 --> 01:25:17,403
is Scott Murphy.
He has carried this small-town team

1357
01:25:17,571 --> 01:25:19,906
against all odds
into the state finals

1358
01:25:20,073 --> 01:25:22,241
against the five-time
state champion

1359
01:25:22,409 --> 01:25:24,076
Cuyahoga Raiders.

1360
01:25:29,208 --> 01:25:30,666
Black-18!

1361
01:25:30,834 --> 01:25:32,001
Hike!

1362
01:25:37,216 --> 01:25:39,217
Got a man open... and hit hard!

1363
01:25:39,384 --> 01:25:41,219
And the pass is incomplete.

1364
01:25:41,386 --> 01:25:43,304
Felt that one,
didn't you, Backwater?

1365
01:25:43,472 --> 01:25:45,681
It's gonna keep coming.
It's gonna keep coming.

1366
01:25:45,849 --> 01:25:48,935
Murphy got absolutely rocked
on that play.

1367
01:25:49,102 --> 01:25:51,479
55 came across the field

1368
01:25:51,647 --> 01:25:53,397
and lit him up
like a Zippo lighter.

1369
01:25:53,565 --> 01:25:55,733
I'm gonna break your neck,
Backwater.

1370
01:25:58,237 --> 01:25:59,403
Hike!

1371
01:26:07,913 --> 01:26:10,665
Scott Murphy has
almost zero protection in the pocket

1372
01:26:10,833 --> 01:26:13,084
from the swarming
Cuyahoga defense.

1373
01:26:15,712 --> 01:26:17,713
Slowing down Backwater?

1374
01:26:18,757 --> 01:26:20,007
I thrive on pain.

1375
01:26:20,175 --> 01:26:21,968
I hope so.
It's coming all night.

1376
01:26:22,135 --> 01:26:23,135
Good job.

1377
01:26:23,303 --> 01:26:24,512
Hike.

1378
01:26:28,934 --> 01:26:30,768
Another late hit
by the Raiders' defense,

1379
01:26:30,936 --> 01:26:33,062
this time on number 81
Chris Hall.

1380
01:26:33,230 --> 01:26:35,106
What did I tell you?
That's exactly what I said.

1381
01:26:35,274 --> 01:26:36,816
The Red Raiders seem to be bent

1382
01:26:36,984 --> 01:26:38,901
on taking Scott Murphy
out of this ball game.

1383
01:26:39,069 --> 01:26:40,444
They haven't taken him out,

1384
01:26:40,612 --> 01:26:41,946
but they've certainly
contained him.

1385
01:26:42,114 --> 01:26:43,990
And Willard is making the case

1386
01:26:44,157 --> 01:26:47,368
that he should have been "Mr. Football"
here in the great state of Ohio.

1387
01:26:49,913 --> 01:26:51,289
Get off him!

1388
01:26:51,456 --> 01:26:53,332
Scott Murphy rocked again.

1389
01:26:53,500 --> 01:26:55,293
It's got to be hard
for this hometown crowd

1390
01:26:55,460 --> 01:26:58,212
to watch their star quarterback taking
this kind of beating here tonight.

1391
01:26:58,380 --> 01:27:00,464
- I can't listen to this. Turn them off.
- And the only thing preventing...

1392
01:27:00,632 --> 01:27:02,300
- The Raiders from running away...
- I can't listen to this.

1393
01:27:02,467 --> 01:27:04,218
- Turn them off!
- With this ball game

1394
01:27:04,386 --> 01:27:07,054
are the penalties, late hits,
and personal fouls.

1395
01:27:11,143 --> 01:27:13,978
Let's go, Bears!

1396
01:27:15,939 --> 01:27:17,315
Red Raiders on three!

1397
01:27:17,482 --> 01:27:20,026
- One, two, three...
- Red Raiders rule!

1398
01:27:23,363 --> 01:27:25,323
Caught by number 9 Kelly

1399
01:27:25,490 --> 01:27:27,575
for another Cuyahoga
first down.

1400
01:27:32,831 --> 01:27:35,207
And that is another
Cuyahoga touchdown

1401
01:27:35,375 --> 01:27:39,503
as the Raiders pull
even further ahead of Coldwater.

1402
01:27:40,505 --> 01:27:42,673
Right now Scott Murphy
has got to be wondering

1403
01:27:42,841 --> 01:27:46,093
what he can do differently
to change the course of this ball game.

1404
01:27:46,261 --> 01:27:48,346
Turn it up a notch.
Use your quickness.

1405
01:27:48,513 --> 01:27:50,598
Now come on, Scott,
you're better than these guys.

1406
01:27:50,766 --> 01:27:51,891
You're better than all of them.

1407
01:27:52,059 --> 01:27:53,851
Coach Hand on the sidelines

1408
01:27:54,019 --> 01:27:55,686
trying to light a fire
under Scott Murphy.

1409
01:27:55,854 --> 01:27:58,105
It's gonna keep coming.

1410
01:28:04,488 --> 01:28:05,488
Hike.

1411
01:28:16,166 --> 01:28:17,541
Yeah! All right.

1412
01:28:17,709 --> 01:28:20,002
I don't know what
Coach Hand just said to Scott Murphy

1413
01:28:20,170 --> 01:28:22,046
or what he was thinking about
on the sidelines,

1414
01:28:22,214 --> 01:28:24,048
but he came back
in this ball game

1415
01:28:24,216 --> 01:28:26,092
ready to prove something.

1416
01:28:32,891 --> 01:28:35,017
Touchdown, Coldwater!

1417
01:28:40,190 --> 01:28:42,233
Coldwater is still in this ball game!

1418
01:28:42,401 --> 01:28:44,986
The score is 14-7.

1419
01:29:00,585 --> 01:29:02,753
Yeah, baby.
That's what I'm talking about.

1420
01:29:02,921 --> 01:29:06,007
Hey, man, cheer up. The Raiders
are the best team in the state.

1421
01:29:06,174 --> 01:29:07,967
It's happening again.
Control the whole game.

1422
01:29:08,135 --> 01:29:09,760
We gotta get ahead.
We gotta get ahead.

1423
01:29:09,928 --> 01:29:11,345
Get out there. Get out there.

1424
01:29:11,513 --> 01:29:12,680
Yeah, boy.

1425
01:29:12,848 --> 01:29:15,182
And Coldwater trails 21-14

1426
01:29:15,350 --> 01:29:17,852
as they head into the locker room
for halftime.

1427
01:29:46,757 --> 01:29:50,134
Gentlemen, some players
have talent.

1428
01:29:50,302 --> 01:29:52,803
Others have heart. But tonight

1429
01:29:52,971 --> 01:29:55,931
I've seen players with talent
who I didn't know had any

1430
01:29:56,099 --> 01:30:00,061
and others with heart
who I thought only had talent.

1431
01:30:00,228 --> 01:30:02,813
The quality and standard
of your life

1432
01:30:02,981 --> 01:30:06,817
will not be determined
by how well you play football,

1433
01:30:06,985 --> 01:30:09,987
but by how well
you confront adversity...

1434
01:30:10,155 --> 01:30:12,156
attitude.

1435
01:30:12,324 --> 01:30:15,618
Gentlemen,
if you keep playing like this,

1436
01:30:15,786 --> 01:30:17,286
I promise you

1437
01:30:17,454 --> 01:30:20,623
you will leave this field winners.
Get in here.

1438
01:30:22,918 --> 01:30:24,835
- One, two, three...
- Coldwater!

1439
01:30:25,003 --> 01:30:26,629
That's what I'm talking about.

1440
01:30:26,797 --> 01:30:28,672
Scott...

1441
01:30:28,840 --> 01:30:30,591
you know I've never seen you
play like this.

1442
01:30:30,759 --> 01:30:32,259
I'm doing
the best I can, Coach.

1443
01:30:32,427 --> 01:30:34,804
Yeah, but don't forget
you got 10 other players with you.

1444
01:30:34,971 --> 01:30:37,181
You don't need to do this
all by yourself.

1445
01:30:37,349 --> 01:30:39,850
You didn't carry this team here.
You led them.

1446
01:30:40,018 --> 01:30:42,269
And they might not be
the biggest and the best players,

1447
01:30:42,437 --> 01:30:44,063
but they're farm boys.

1448
01:30:44,231 --> 01:30:46,774
Lean on them. They won't break.

1449
01:30:46,942 --> 01:30:47,983
Come on.

1450
01:31:02,541 --> 01:31:05,334
Yeah, okay.
Let's get it going, son.

1451
01:31:05,502 --> 01:31:07,294
- Put Gig in.
- What?

1452
01:31:07,462 --> 01:31:09,547
You want me to use my team.
Put Gig in.

1453
01:31:12,676 --> 01:31:15,219
You want me to pull out a good receiver
and put in one who can't catch?

1454
01:31:15,387 --> 01:31:17,054
No, just add a fourth
and spread them out.

1455
01:31:17,222 --> 01:31:18,848
If I put in a fourth
wide out, son,

1456
01:31:19,015 --> 01:31:20,975
that's gonna be one less body
protecting you.

1457
01:31:21,143 --> 01:31:22,351
Yeah, I know.

1458
01:31:22,519 --> 01:31:24,228
Let's go.

1459
01:31:30,068 --> 01:31:31,735
Gig.

1460
01:31:33,363 --> 01:31:34,405
Get in there.

1461
01:31:34,573 --> 01:31:36,740
Get in where, Coach? In the game?
Somebody get hurt?

1462
01:31:36,908 --> 01:31:39,034
Nobody. Get in there.

1463
01:31:42,372 --> 01:31:45,249
Gig Bird,
number 2 in for Coldwater.

1464
01:31:45,417 --> 01:31:47,376
Not sure what the plan is here
with Bird...

1465
01:31:47,544 --> 01:31:51,297
zero career yards,
zero receptions.

1466
01:31:51,464 --> 01:31:53,883
- Get open, cowboy.
- What are you talking about, Murph?

1467
01:31:54,050 --> 01:31:55,509
- Changing history.
- What did he say?

1468
01:31:55,677 --> 01:31:56,886
- On one, on one. Ready?
- Break.

1469
01:32:00,056 --> 01:32:03,017
Hey, back up, back up, G.
What are you doing, man?

1470
01:32:03,185 --> 01:32:04,351
Black EG!

1471
01:32:04,519 --> 01:32:07,354
Murphy under center, huge play.

1472
01:32:07,522 --> 01:32:09,106
Short drop.
Here comes the rush.

1473
01:32:09,274 --> 01:32:11,025
He steps up and throws to Bird.
And the pass...

1474
01:32:11,193 --> 01:32:14,236
is gonna be dropped.

1475
01:32:14,404 --> 01:32:17,740
Gig has to catch that ball
up at the 27.

1476
01:32:17,908 --> 01:32:19,533
- All right, all right.
- What the hell are you doing?

1477
01:32:19,701 --> 01:32:21,076
- He was open.
- Yeah, he's always open,

1478
01:32:21,244 --> 01:32:23,078
but we never throw it to him
because he can't catch.

1479
01:32:23,246 --> 01:32:24,914
How do you know he can't catch
if we never throw it to him?

1480
01:32:25,081 --> 01:32:26,707
He's right, man.
I ain't never caught one.

1481
01:32:26,875 --> 01:32:28,292
Well, we're about
to change that.

1482
01:32:28,460 --> 01:32:30,502
Red 33, Red 33. On one, on one.

1483
01:32:30,670 --> 01:32:32,213
- Ready?
- Break.

1484
01:32:32,380 --> 01:32:35,466
Red 33! Red 33!

1485
01:32:35,634 --> 01:32:37,092
Hike.

1486
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:46,977
Murphy with a perfect
pass to Bird who was wide open.

1487
01:32:48,897 --> 01:32:50,981
Just tell me you know
what you're doing here.

1488
01:32:51,149 --> 01:32:52,608
Using my team, Coach.

1489
01:32:52,776 --> 01:32:54,777
You got three other
receivers out there.

1490
01:32:57,197 --> 01:32:59,782
All right, come on, man.
Amateur night's over.

1491
01:32:59,950 --> 01:33:01,533
Just give me the ball
so we can get a first down.

1492
01:33:01,701 --> 01:33:04,119
- Yeah, man, don't throw it to me.
- Don't worry, it's not coming near you.

1493
01:33:04,287 --> 01:33:06,830
Good. 'Cause I play my best as a decoy.
See, I got them fooled.

1494
01:33:06,998 --> 01:33:08,499
I got them right where I want them.
Keep the ball away from me.

1495
01:33:08,667 --> 01:33:10,292
Red dog six. On one, on one.

1496
01:33:10,460 --> 01:33:11,710
- Ready?
- Break.

1497
01:33:11,878 --> 01:33:13,963
In the shotgun,
third and 10 from their own 20,

1498
01:33:14,130 --> 01:33:16,465
four lineups.
Murphy needs a big game here.

1499
01:33:18,051 --> 01:33:20,094
The ball is snapped.
Murphy back to throw.

1500
01:33:22,389 --> 01:33:24,640
Short drop, looks over the middle.
The pass is gonna be...

1501
01:33:24,808 --> 01:33:27,226
caught... by Bird

1502
01:33:27,394 --> 01:33:29,478
for a first down at the 35!

1503
01:33:33,566 --> 01:33:36,735
What a catch... by Bird!

1504
01:33:36,903 --> 01:33:38,696
And the crowd loves it

1505
01:33:38,863 --> 01:33:40,823
here in Coldwater, Ohio.

1506
01:33:40,991 --> 01:33:43,826
Look at Gig. They know how big

1507
01:33:43,994 --> 01:33:45,995
- that throw and catch was...
- I caught one! I caught one!

1508
01:33:46,162 --> 01:33:48,289
For Coldwater.

1509
01:33:51,584 --> 01:33:53,460
All right,
if Gig can catch one,

1510
01:33:53,628 --> 01:33:55,504
we can win this game
and get home in one piece.

1511
01:33:55,672 --> 01:33:58,173
Rodriguez, it's your turn.
We're gonna run the reverse with you.

1512
01:33:58,341 --> 01:34:00,676
- I want to send you around the corner.
- What? What about Willard?

1513
01:34:00,844 --> 01:34:02,803
Don't worry about Willard.
I'll take care of him.

1514
01:34:02,971 --> 01:34:05,347
Boys, I want to get as far ahead
of them as possible

1515
01:34:05,515 --> 01:34:07,641
- before the fourth quarter.
- Why didn't you say so?

1516
01:34:07,809 --> 01:34:09,351
Hell, I thought we were just
trying to eat the clock.

1517
01:34:09,519 --> 01:34:10,519
All right, Rodriguez
reversed on one.

1518
01:34:10,687 --> 01:34:12,354
Break!

1519
01:34:14,190 --> 01:34:16,525
Going down, Backwater.

1520
01:34:16,693 --> 01:34:18,193
Blue 38.

1521
01:34:18,361 --> 01:34:19,778
Hike.

1522
01:34:20,780 --> 01:34:22,531
Murphy to Rodriguez
on the reverse...

1523
01:34:22,699 --> 01:34:25,034
the old "dipsy-do."
Rodriguez around the corner.

1524
01:34:25,201 --> 01:34:26,702
Murphy lays out Willard.

1525
01:34:26,870 --> 01:34:28,746
And Rodriguez scrambles
for another 10.

1526
01:34:28,913 --> 01:34:30,372
Coldwater first down.

1527
01:34:30,540 --> 01:34:31,707
All right.

1528
01:34:31,875 --> 01:34:34,501
Hey, Willard, it's Coldwater...
with a C.

1529
01:34:38,965 --> 01:34:41,550
Scott, 27 boot.

1530
01:34:45,388 --> 01:34:48,807
All right, 27 boot
on one, on one.

1531
01:34:48,975 --> 01:34:50,267
- Ready?
- Break.

1532
01:34:54,230 --> 01:34:56,899
Let's go, defense.

1533
01:34:57,067 --> 01:34:59,276
Red seven.

1534
01:34:59,444 --> 01:35:00,736
Hike.

1535
01:35:12,248 --> 01:35:13,832
Touchdown, Coldwater!

1536
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,043
Yes! That's it.

1537
01:35:22,258 --> 01:35:24,051
Attaboy. Attaboy.

1538
01:35:24,219 --> 01:35:25,552
Jeez!

1539
01:35:27,597 --> 01:35:29,223
We're in this thing.
We're in it.

1540
01:35:33,353 --> 01:35:35,270
And the Coldwater
defense coming together

1541
01:35:35,438 --> 01:35:37,481
with a big stop on third down,

1542
01:35:37,649 --> 01:35:40,275
forcing the Red Raiders
to settle for a field goal.

1543
01:35:43,029 --> 01:35:46,115
And it's blocked!
The field goal is blocked by Moss!

1544
01:35:46,282 --> 01:35:47,699
It's blocked by Moss!

1545
01:35:47,867 --> 01:35:50,077
Murphy starting things out
here in the second half.

1546
01:35:50,245 --> 01:35:53,205
And now Coldwater
has a chance to pull ahead

1547
01:35:53,373 --> 01:35:55,082
for the first time
in this ball game.

1548
01:35:55,250 --> 01:35:57,459
Get your head in the game!

1549
01:35:57,627 --> 01:35:59,461
This is a state championship!

1550
01:35:59,629 --> 01:36:02,256
Black razor. Black razor.

1551
01:36:05,969 --> 01:36:08,512
Down. Set.

1552
01:36:08,680 --> 01:36:12,015
Black 16. Black 16.

1553
01:36:12,183 --> 01:36:13,559
Hike.

1554
01:36:23,361 --> 01:36:24,945
That's gonna be caught!

1555
01:36:25,113 --> 01:36:27,448
That's a touchdown, Coldwater!

1556
01:36:29,159 --> 01:36:31,535
And this hometown crowd
is going crazy

1557
01:36:31,703 --> 01:36:35,164
as Coldwater has taken the lead.
Can you believe it?

1558
01:36:38,460 --> 01:36:40,836
We did it. We changed it!

1559
01:36:55,643 --> 01:36:58,020
Thelma, what the hell are you doing?

1560
01:36:58,188 --> 01:36:59,938
My job.
What the hell are you doing?

1561
01:37:00,106 --> 01:37:01,940
- Your shift is up.
- No, it's not.

1562
01:37:02,108 --> 01:37:05,319
- Are you gonna argue with me?
- Yeah. I need the hours.

1563
01:37:05,487 --> 01:37:07,905
Okay, you got the hours,

1564
01:37:08,072 --> 01:37:10,699
but your shift is done.
Now get out of here.

1565
01:37:10,867 --> 01:37:13,494
- Get the hell out of here.
- All right, all right.

1566
01:37:25,381 --> 01:37:27,299
First and 10 for Coldwater.

1567
01:37:27,467 --> 01:37:30,469
They can smell
a state championship trophy

1568
01:37:30,637 --> 01:37:33,889
and a huge parade
in that small village of 2700.

1569
01:37:34,057 --> 01:37:36,558
Cuyahoga is out of time outs.

1570
01:37:36,726 --> 01:37:38,393
All Murphy needs to do

1571
01:37:38,561 --> 01:37:41,063
is get a first down here
to run out the clock

1572
01:37:41,231 --> 01:37:43,815
and they will be
the state champions.

1573
01:37:45,068 --> 01:37:46,318
Come on, man,
what are we running?

1574
01:37:46,486 --> 01:37:49,196
I-right, Z-motion, 48 boot.

1575
01:37:49,364 --> 01:37:51,073
- On one, on one. Ready?
- Break.

1576
01:37:52,367 --> 01:37:54,243
Murphy drops back.
Here comes the blitz.

1577
01:37:54,410 --> 01:37:56,745
Murphy slips the tackle,
rolls left,

1578
01:37:56,913 --> 01:37:59,373
scrambles out of the pocket,
looking down the field

1579
01:37:59,541 --> 01:38:01,542
like he's gonna throw it.
Hall's double covered.

1580
01:38:01,709 --> 01:38:03,293
Rodriguez looks open...

1581
01:38:07,590 --> 01:38:09,424
And he's hit.
He fumbles the ball,

1582
01:38:09,592 --> 01:38:11,760
picked up by Scotty Hamlin
at the 40,

1583
01:38:11,928 --> 01:38:13,762
35, 30, 20,

1584
01:38:13,930 --> 01:38:15,472
15, 10, 5.

1585
01:38:15,640 --> 01:38:18,725
Do you believe it?
Touchdown, Cuyahoga!

1586
01:38:19,769 --> 01:38:22,396
And it looks like Murphy
is down on the turf

1587
01:38:22,564 --> 01:38:24,523
back at the 48.

1588
01:38:24,691 --> 01:38:26,817
Murph, are you all right?

1589
01:38:30,071 --> 01:38:32,406
There is no way
this team comes back

1590
01:38:32,574 --> 01:38:35,409
if Murphy can't get up
and back into the ball game.

1591
01:38:37,078 --> 01:38:39,288
Let's see if we can get him up.
Easy now.

1592
01:38:42,584 --> 01:38:44,126
Get out of the way.

1593
01:38:59,684 --> 01:39:01,476
And the big story for Coldwater

1594
01:39:01,644 --> 01:39:03,312
has been quarterback
Scott Murphy.

1595
01:39:03,479 --> 01:39:06,023
Raised by a single mother
who works in a factory,

1596
01:39:06,190 --> 01:39:08,734
he was recently named
"Mr. Football"

1597
01:39:08,901 --> 01:39:11,194
as the outstanding player
in the state.

1598
01:39:11,362 --> 01:39:12,988
And the extra point is good.

1599
01:39:13,156 --> 01:39:15,324
Cuyahoga now leads by four

1600
01:39:15,491 --> 01:39:17,534
at the tail end
of this ball game.

1601
01:39:17,702 --> 01:39:21,330
And Coldwater will need
a miracle touchdown to win it.

1602
01:39:21,497 --> 01:39:23,457
Are you all right?
Are you good to go?

1603
01:39:23,625 --> 01:39:25,167
- I'm okay.
- Are you sure?

1604
01:39:25,335 --> 01:39:26,335
Yes.

1605
01:39:26,502 --> 01:39:28,378
All right, run the clock.

1606
01:39:28,546 --> 01:39:30,172
Work the sidelines.

1607
01:39:31,841 --> 01:39:33,508
Cuyahoga heading out to kick.

1608
01:39:33,676 --> 01:39:35,802
And it looks like Murphy
is getting into the game

1609
01:39:35,970 --> 01:39:37,679
to receive for Coldwater.

1610
01:39:46,189 --> 01:39:47,314
This is it, folks.

1611
01:39:47,482 --> 01:39:50,108
A Coldwater victory here
would be a fairytale ending

1612
01:39:50,276 --> 01:39:52,319
for this hardworking
blue collar community.

1613
01:39:52,487 --> 01:39:54,404
13 seconds left in the game,

1614
01:39:54,572 --> 01:39:56,239
just one time out remaining.

1615
01:39:56,407 --> 01:39:58,742
Coldwater needs a touchdown
right here

1616
01:39:58,910 --> 01:40:00,577
to win the state championship.

1617
01:40:00,745 --> 01:40:04,456
Scott Murphy, "Mr. Football,"
deep to return the kick.

1618
01:40:04,624 --> 01:40:06,708
And he'll take it
to the 50, to the 45.

1619
01:40:06,876 --> 01:40:08,960
Murphy's hit, but he breaks the tackle,
he stays on his feet,

1620
01:40:09,128 --> 01:40:10,545
- breaks another tackle...
- Come on, come on!

1621
01:40:10,713 --> 01:40:12,464
Inside the 35, inside the 30,

1622
01:40:12,632 --> 01:40:14,424
and is knocked down at the 26.

1623
01:40:14,592 --> 01:40:17,969
And he'll quickly call a time out
to talk to Coach Hand.

1624
01:40:20,181 --> 01:40:22,391
This has been
one of the great games

1625
01:40:22,558 --> 01:40:25,060
in Ohio high school
football history.

1626
01:40:26,270 --> 01:40:29,731
3.5 seconds left on the clock
here in the fourth quarter.

1627
01:40:29,899 --> 01:40:31,733
Third down, 42-38.

1628
01:40:31,901 --> 01:40:34,152
Words exchanged
on the sidelines

1629
01:40:34,320 --> 01:40:36,822
as Murphy appears to be arguing

1630
01:40:36,989 --> 01:40:38,573
the final play call
by Coach Hand.

1631
01:40:38,741 --> 01:40:40,409
- I'm not running the bootleg.
- What?

1632
01:40:40,576 --> 01:40:41,993
I'm not running Black Seven.
I'm not doing it.

1633
01:40:42,161 --> 01:40:45,455
Son, we got 30 yards to cover
in one play. We're not running the ball.

1634
01:40:45,623 --> 01:40:47,749
I know. I'm not running Black Seven.
I'm not doing it again.

1635
01:40:47,917 --> 01:40:51,253
We're not running
Black Seven, okay?

1636
01:40:51,421 --> 01:40:54,756
Let's go Red 24.

1637
01:40:54,924 --> 01:40:57,676
Hit Hall or Rodriguez
in the corner.

1638
01:40:57,844 --> 01:40:59,553
Wait, Coach, you want me
to throw the ball?

1639
01:40:59,721 --> 01:41:01,930
Yeah, that's the play.
Let's get to the line of scrimmage.

1640
01:41:02,098 --> 01:41:05,183
If you don't like something,
change it, audible.

1641
01:41:05,351 --> 01:41:07,144
Coach, what?

1642
01:41:07,311 --> 01:41:10,939
Scott, whatever happens,
it's your choice.

1643
01:41:13,568 --> 01:41:15,068
Come on.

1644
01:41:17,196 --> 01:41:18,780
- What are we running?
- I changed it.

1645
01:41:18,948 --> 01:41:20,824
Changed what?

1646
01:41:20,992 --> 01:41:22,868
Everything.

1647
01:41:33,755 --> 01:41:35,964
All right, you guys ready
to win this?

1648
01:41:36,132 --> 01:41:37,883
Red 24 on one.

1649
01:41:38,050 --> 01:41:39,801
Hall, you're gonna be open
in the end zone.

1650
01:41:39,969 --> 01:41:41,219
Catch it. On one.

1651
01:41:41,387 --> 01:41:42,387
- Ready?
- Break.

1652
01:41:42,555 --> 01:41:43,638
Let's go.

1653
01:41:44,640 --> 01:41:46,641
Me and you, buddy, me and you.

1654
01:41:54,233 --> 01:41:56,359
Down!

1655
01:42:47,870 --> 01:42:49,287
Check! Check!

1656
01:42:49,455 --> 01:42:50,872
Check. Check.

1657
01:42:51,040 --> 01:42:53,583
- Black seven!
- What are you doing, man?

1658
01:42:53,751 --> 01:42:55,418
- Black seven!
- Murphy, what are you doing?

1659
01:42:55,586 --> 01:42:57,003
Black seven! Black seven!

1660
01:42:57,171 --> 01:42:59,798
Black seven! Black seven!

1661
01:43:06,264 --> 01:43:08,306
Down!

1662
01:43:09,725 --> 01:43:11,017
Set!

1663
01:43:11,185 --> 01:43:12,644
Hike!

1664
01:44:35,645 --> 01:44:37,646
Touchdown, Coldwater!

1665
01:44:37,813 --> 01:44:40,982
They will be
the state champions of Ohio.

1666
01:45:16,185 --> 01:45:17,769
Dispatch.

1667
01:45:17,937 --> 01:45:20,021
Dispatch, this is Murphy.
Come in.

1668
01:45:21,691 --> 01:45:23,358
Dispatch.

1669
01:45:34,829 --> 01:45:37,872
I ran out of gas.

1670
01:49:02,536 --> 01:49:04,495
Come on, Culpepper.

1671
01:49:04,663 --> 01:49:07,415
My grandmother could pick beans
faster than that.

1672
01:49:19,511 --> 01:49:21,763
The best six-and-four team
I've ever seen.

1673
01:49:22,932 --> 01:49:25,433
Seven and four. We won tonight.

1674
01:49:28,812 --> 01:49:30,146
Hey, Coach?

1675
01:49:31,857 --> 01:49:33,733
Thanks.

1676
01:49:33,901 --> 01:49:35,985
No need.

1677
01:49:36,153 --> 01:49:37,946
Now I'll see you
on our field Monday.

1678
01:49:38,948 --> 01:49:42,450
Tell your quarterbacks to be
dressed and ready at 3:00 sharp.

1679
01:49:49,458 --> 01:49:51,709
Brandon, get those
baskets emptied

1680
01:49:51,877 --> 01:49:53,878
and get your butt back here.

1681
01:49:54,880 --> 01:49:56,881
Hey, Mr. Murphy.

1682
01:50:36,463 --> 01:50:38,673
Oh, look who decided
to show up.

1683
01:50:38,841 --> 01:50:41,301
Murph, you missed
a hell of a ceremony, man.

1684
01:50:41,468 --> 01:50:44,762
Yeah, this twig catches
one lucky pass... standing ovation.

1685
01:50:44,930 --> 01:50:47,056
- Hey, you caught a pass?
- Man, that was nothing.

1686
01:50:47,224 --> 01:50:48,474
They would have torn
the stadium down for you.

1687
01:50:48,642 --> 01:50:49,767
- Yep.
- Amen.

1688
01:50:49,935 --> 01:50:53,021
No, this is better.
Where's my wife?

1689
01:50:53,188 --> 01:50:55,648
In the barn.
She's been looking for you.

1690
01:51:05,200 --> 01:51:07,785
Macy!

1691
01:51:23,218 --> 01:51:25,595
- Daddy!
- Daddy!

1692
01:51:39,068 --> 01:51:40,401
Here he is.

1693
01:51:40,569 --> 01:51:43,071
Here he is.

1694
01:51:44,698 --> 01:51:46,783
Hi.

1695
01:52:13,352 --> 01:52:15,478
You're back.

1696
01:52:26,532 --> 01:52:28,324
I love you.

1697
01:52:34,248 --> 01:52:35,790
Look at this.

1698
01:52:35,958 --> 01:52:37,375
Look at all these people?

1699
01:52:37,543 --> 01:52:39,293
I can't believe it.

1700
01:52:41,004 --> 01:52:43,005
- Come here.
- Come on.

1701
01:52:47,845 --> 01:52:50,304
Look at all these people.

1702
01:52:52,766 --> 01:52:54,350
