All Showered?

179
00:08:14,562 --> 00:08:15,363
Um-Huh.

180
00:08:15,396 --> 00:08:15,997
Brushed
Your Teeth?

181
00:08:16,864 --> 00:08:17,333
Picked Out Your Clothes For Tomorrow?

182
00:08:18,133 --> 00:08:19,368
All Right. Give Me
A Hug And A Kiss.

183
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,270
I Love You.

184
00:08:21,302 --> 00:08:22,403
Two Tons?

185
00:08:22,436 --> 00:08:23,806
Two Tons--Six Tons!

186
00:08:23,838 --> 00:08:25,440
I'll Be Up In Ten Minutes To Tuck You In.
Scoot.

187
00:08:25,473 --> 00:08:26,741
Ok.

188
00:08:26,775 --> 00:08:27,910
Bye, Dad.

189
00:08:27,943 --> 00:08:29,143
I Love You, Son.

190
00:08:29,177 --> 00:08:30,611
Love You.

191
00:08:30,644 --> 00:08:33,314
Hey, You're Not Still Logged On The Internet,
Are You?

192
00:08:33,348 --> 00:08:34,650
Why?

193
00:08:34,682 --> 00:08:36,217
How's Anybody Supposed To
Call Us If You're Always

194
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:37,085
Tying Up The Line?

195
00:08:38,452 --> 00:08:39,454
We're All Here.

196
00:08:39,488 --> 00:08:40,289
Who Else Do You
Need To Talk To?

197
00:08:40,321 --> 00:08:41,623
Gee, I Don't Know, Ben.

198
00:08:41,656 --> 00:08:43,425
You Know... Your Grandparents,
A Friend, Maybe.

199
00:08:43,457 --> 00:08:44,392
All Right!
All Right!

200
00:08:44,426 --> 00:08:45,994
I'll Be Off At
Exactly 10:01.

201
00:08:46,027 --> 00:08:46,895
I Promise.

202
00:08:46,927 --> 00:08:48,429
Listen. Speaking Of Calls,

203
00:08:48,462 --> 00:08:51,299
You Haven't Neglected To Give Me
Any Messages Lately, Have You?

204
00:08:51,332 --> 00:08:52,300
Well, Like From Who?

205
00:08:52,334 --> 00:08:54,636
Ah, A Woman Named... Uh...

206
00:08:54,668 --> 00:08:56,571
Oh, Melanie.

207
00:08:56,605 --> 00:08:57,739
She Called?

208
00:08:57,772 --> 00:09:00,175
Yeah. Last Thursday.

209
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:01,677
I'm Really, Really
Sorry, Dad.

210
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:03,512
I Guess I Just Forgot.

211
00:09:03,544 --> 00:09:05,113
How Many Times Have I Asked You

212
00:09:05,147 --> 00:09:06,581
To Please Write
Down My Messages?

213
00:09:06,614 --> 00:09:08,350
That Happens To Be The
Woman That Mrs. Macatee

214
00:09:08,383 --> 00:09:09,518
Was Trying To Fix Me Up With.

215
00:09:09,551 --> 00:09:11,018
Well, Blow Her Off.

216
00:09:11,052 --> 00:09:13,589
Trust Me. I Mean, This
Lady Sounded Like...

217
00:09:13,622 --> 00:09:15,591
Well, I Don't Know, But I
Could Tell She's Definitely

218
00:09:15,624 --> 00:09:16,959
Not Your Type.

219
00:09:16,991 --> 00:09:18,960
It's Been So Long Since I've
Been Out With Anybody

220
00:09:18,994 --> 00:09:20,495
How Could I Possibly
Have A Type?

221
00:09:20,528 --> 00:09:21,763
Well, Exactly.

222
00:09:21,796 --> 00:09:23,198
I Mean, You're Doing So
Great Without A Woman

223
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:24,365
Why Rock The Boat?

224
00:09:24,398 --> 00:09:27,835
Good Night, Benjamin.

225
00:09:27,869 --> 00:09:29,904
'Night, Dad.

226
00:09:35,009 --> 00:09:37,545
Ummm... 8,411.

227
00:09:37,579 --> 00:09:39,982
Sara, Miles,

228
00:09:40,014 --> 00:09:43,518
I'm Very Pleased With The Number

229
00:09:44,552 --> 00:09:46,020
Well, Thanks To The
Constant Hard Work

231
00:09:47,556 --> 00:09:49,525
Couldn't Have Done It
Without Such An Exciting

232
00:09:49,557 --> 00:09:51,292
And Innovative House
To Promote, Sara.

233
00:09:51,326 --> 00:09:55,831
Well, We're Just A Regular Mutual Admiration Society,
Aren't We?

234
00:09:57,532 --> 00:09:58,499
[Phone Rings]

235
00:09:58,533 --> 00:09:59,167
Ten O'clock.

236
00:09:59,201 --> 00:10:00,201
Oh!

237
00:10:00,234 --> 00:10:01,836
The Contest Is
Now Closed.

238
00:10:01,869 --> 00:10:02,904
Meaning We Can
Select Our Winner?

239
00:10:02,937 --> 00:10:04,872
Oh! Could Pat Have The Honors?

240
00:10:04,906 --> 00:10:07,508
Can She Do That?

241
00:10:07,542 --> 00:10:09,478
Mr. Tuttle, You Cut
Me To The Quick.

242
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:11,879
I Don't Know If
You Know This,

243
00:10:11,912 --> 00:10:13,749
But My Smart House Can
Do Just About Anything.

244
00:10:13,782 --> 00:10:15,249
By All Means.

245
00:10:15,283 --> 00:10:16,384
Good.

246
00:10:16,417 --> 00:10:18,686
Pat, Process Contest
Entries, Please.

247
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,590
<I>Yes, Sara. Accessing
Contest Entries.

248
00:10:21,623 --> 00:10:23,725
Initiate Random
Shuffle Mode, Please.

249
00:10:23,758 --> 00:10:26,028
<I>Initiating Random Shuffle Mode.

250
00:10:26,061 --> 00:10:29,864
Now, Pat, Make A Selection.

251
00:10:29,898 --> 00:10:33,469
<I>Lucky Electronic
Postcard Accessed.

252
00:10:35,236 --> 00:10:39,240
<I>And The Winner Is...

253
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:46,682
Still Busy.

254
00:10:46,715 --> 00:10:49,484
There Definitely Must Be A
Teenager In That House.

255
00:10:51,219 --> 00:10:52,521
Keep Trying, Miles.

256
00:10:52,553 --> 00:10:53,788
If It Gets Too Late,

257
00:10:53,821 --> 00:10:55,390
You Can Always Call First
Thing In The Morning.

258
00:11:05,499 --> 00:11:07,302
Huh!

259
00:11:13,741 --> 00:11:15,243
Oh, Man!

260
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,215
Thanks A Lot, You Guys!

261
00:11:20,248 --> 00:11:21,283
Wasn't Anybody
Gonna Wake Me Up?

262
00:11:21,316 --> 00:11:22,750
Didn't Your
Alarm Go Off?

263
00:11:22,783 --> 00:11:24,619
No. I Never Set It. I Fell
Asleep In Front Of My Computer.

264
00:11:24,653 --> 00:11:25,787
Uh-Huh.

265
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,656
Oh, Man! We're Gonna
Be Later Than Usual.

266
00:11:27,688 --> 00:11:29,624
And Nobody's Even Made
Our Lunches Yet.

267
00:11:29,658 --> 00:11:32,628
Ok. How About You Guys Buy
Today So We Can Get Going?

268
00:11:32,661 --> 00:11:34,396
There's For You.
There's For You.

269
00:11:34,428 --> 00:11:36,063
Hey, Did The Guys From
The Smart House Call?

270
00:11:36,096 --> 00:11:37,798
Oh, Didn't I Tell You?

271
00:11:37,831 --> 00:11:39,400
We Won A Brand New House
With All New Furnishings.

272
00:11:39,433 --> 00:11:40,735
I Guess It Just
Slipped My Mind.

273
00:11:40,768 --> 00:11:41,436
Yeah. Funny.

274
00:11:41,469 --> 00:11:42,671
Let's Go.

275
00:11:42,704 --> 00:11:44,106
[Phone Rings]

276
00:11:44,138 --> 00:11:44,940
I'll Get It!

277
00:11:44,973 --> 00:11:46,608
Let The Machine Get It.

278
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,276
We've Got To Hit The Road.

279
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:49,911
Out, Out, Out. March.

280
00:11:49,943 --> 00:11:53,114
<I>[Angie's Voice] Hi.
You've Reached The Cooper Family.

281
00:11:53,148 --> 00:11:56,084
<I>We're Probably Out,
So Leave A Message And We'll Call You Back.

282
00:11:56,116 --> 00:11:56,851
<I>[Ben's Voice]
If You're Lucky.

283
00:11:56,884 --> 00:11:58,419
Way To Go, Cooper!

284
00:11:58,452 --> 00:12:00,254
What Was That All About?

285
00:12:00,287 --> 00:12:01,856
I Don't Know.

286
00:12:01,889 --> 00:12:05,494
So, Anyways, I Fell Asleep
Last Night About Ten

287
00:12:05,527 --> 00:12:07,696
And I Woke Up This Morning,
And Still No Call.

288
00:12:07,729 --> 00:12:08,930
Maybe They'll Call Today.

289
00:12:08,962 --> 00:12:09,497
Maybe.

290
00:12:09,531 --> 00:12:11,199
Cooper!

291
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:13,467
Where's The Science Report You Were
Supposed To Do For Me, Benny Boy?

292
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,370
Ryan, Don't You Realize That
By Using Other People's Work,

293
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:18,373
All You're Ultimately Doing
Is Hurting Yourself?

294
00:12:18,406 --> 00:12:20,976
How Can I Be Hurting
Myself, Geek,

295
00:12:21,008 --> 00:12:22,210
When I'm Too Busy
Hurting You?

296
00:12:23,577 --> 00:12:26,380
Science Report In My
Locker Before Lunch!

297
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:29,884
I Think I'm Actually Growing Baloney In Here.

298
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:31,586
Here He Comes!

299
00:12:40,528 --> 00:12:42,163
Congratulations!

300
00:12:42,196 --> 00:12:43,565
I Can't Believe How
Lucky You Are!

301
00:12:43,598 --> 00:12:45,901
Lucky? Lucky For What?

302
00:12:45,933 --> 00:12:47,403
For This!

303
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:51,672
It's Us?! We Won?!

304
00:12:51,706 --> 00:12:52,874
We Won! All Right!

305
00:12:52,907 --> 00:12:55,210
C'mon, Ben. There's
Gotta Be A Catch.

306
00:12:55,243 --> 00:12:58,180
They Don't Give Away A--
What Did You Call It?

307
00:12:58,212 --> 00:13:00,047
A House Of The Future
Without Wanting

308
00:13:00,081 --> 00:13:02,216
Some Kind Of
Something In Return.

309
00:13:02,249 --> 00:13:03,217
<I>You Can't Blow This, Dad.

310
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:04,720
Please, I'm Not
Exaggerating.

311
00:13:04,753 --> 00:13:07,055
It Is Like The Ultimate
Opportunity Of A Lifetime.

312
00:13:07,087 --> 00:13:08,723
If You've Got A
Paper There,

313
00:13:08,757 --> 00:13:09,891
Grab The Local Section
And See For Yourself.

314
00:13:09,923 --> 00:13:12,093
All Right, All Right. Hold On.

315
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,835
Beautiful!

316
00:13:20,869 --> 00:13:21,702
<I>And Practical Too.

317
00:13:21,735 --> 00:13:22,870
You Know Her?

318
00:13:22,903 --> 00:13:24,939
What Are You Talking About?

319
00:13:24,973 --> 00:13:26,541
<I>What Are You
Talking About?

320
00:13:26,574 --> 00:13:28,008
The Smart House.

321
00:13:28,042 --> 00:13:31,379
Well, Uh,
I Don't See Why We Can't Check It Out.

322
00:13:31,412 --> 00:13:32,648
Yes!

323
00:13:36,084 --> 00:13:38,520
Ladies And Gentlemen,

324
00:13:38,552 --> 00:13:42,423
First Of All, I'd Like To Thank
You All For Coming Today.

325
00:13:42,456 --> 00:13:45,092
It's A Pleasure To See
Such A Wonderful Turnout

326
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:46,927
From The Press Corps.

327
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:50,465
Although I Was Gonna Introduce
The Contest Winners Myself,

328
00:13:50,498 --> 00:13:54,436
It Seems More Appropriate To Let
Smart House Do The Honors.

329
00:13:55,403 --> 00:13:57,706
Pat!

330
00:13:57,739 --> 00:13:59,908
<I>Ladies And Gentlemen,

331
00:13:59,941 --> 00:14:02,911
<I>I'd Like To Introduce You
To Our Newest Occupants,

332
00:14:02,943 --> 00:14:07,281
<I>The Cooper Family,
Nick, Ben, And Angie.

333
00:14:09,417 --> 00:14:10,485
Sara.

334
00:14:13,754 --> 00:14:14,889
Thank You, Pat.

335
00:14:14,922 --> 00:14:17,158
Excuse Me, Ms.
Barnes... Pat?

336
00:14:17,191 --> 00:14:20,394
It Stands For Personal
Applied Technology.

337
00:14:20,427 --> 00:14:22,096
Ms. Barnes, Do
Your Winners

338
00:14:22,129 --> 00:14:23,564
Have To Have Extensive
Computer Knowledge

339
00:14:23,598 --> 00:14:24,900
To Live In The
Smart House?

340
00:14:24,932 --> 00:14:26,301
No. Absolutely Not.

341
00:14:26,334 --> 00:14:28,970
Pat Is The Most User-Friendly
Home On The Block.

342
00:14:29,003 --> 00:14:31,071
How Does Pat Actually
Get To Learn

343
00:14:31,105 --> 00:14:32,606
And To Know About
Her New Occupants?

344
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,308
The Same Way You Or I Would.

345
00:14:34,341 --> 00:14:36,510
She Observes Them,
Studies Their Habits,

346
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:39,013
Keys Into Their Every Need.

347
00:14:39,047 --> 00:14:40,782
Pat's Ability To
Learn On The Job

348
00:14:40,815 --> 00:14:42,517
Is Her Most Advanced Feature.

349
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:44,787
Is There Anything
This House Can't Do?

350
00:14:46,955 --> 00:14:50,025
Mime. But We Feel That
That's A Good Thing.

351
00:14:54,662 --> 00:14:55,997
Oow!

352
00:14:56,029 --> 00:14:58,432
You Didn't Tell Me That
Thing Was Gonna Bite Me.

353
00:14:58,465 --> 00:15:00,869
I'm Sorry.
That's Just Pat's Way Of Getting To Know You.

354
00:15:00,902 --> 00:15:04,706
<I>Angie Cooper. Age Nine, 52
Inches Tall, 62 Pounds,

355
00:15:04,739 --> 00:15:07,843
<I>Blond Hair, Brown Eyes,
12 % Body Fat,

356
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:12,012
<I>Had Measles And One Early Case
Of Pneumonia, No Broken Bones.

357
00:15:12,046 --> 00:15:14,648
Whoa! How'd She
Know All That?

358
00:15:14,682 --> 00:15:15,951
The Bite.

359
00:15:15,984 --> 00:15:17,853
The Bite You Felt Was A
Tiny, Microscopic

360
00:15:17,885 --> 00:15:19,353
Blood And Tissue Sample.

361
00:15:19,387 --> 00:15:21,857
She Analyzed Your Dna,
Registered Your Body Temperature,

362
00:15:21,889 --> 00:15:24,024
And Then Broke Down Your
Entire Medical History.

363
00:15:24,057 --> 00:15:25,960
Wow. Impressive.

364
00:15:25,994 --> 00:15:28,964
The Thing About Pat Is, The More
Time She Spends With You,

365
00:15:28,997 --> 00:15:30,665
The More She Learns.

366
00:15:30,697 --> 00:15:32,033
So, Before Long, She's
Gonna Know More About You

367
00:15:32,066 --> 00:15:33,133
Than You Know Yourself.

368
00:15:33,167 --> 00:15:35,170
That's Kind Of Creepy,
Isn't It?

369
00:15:35,202 --> 00:15:37,204
I Mean, It's Like Big
Brother Is Watching You,

370
00:15:37,238 --> 00:15:39,641
Only Big Brother Turns
Out To Be Your House.

371
00:15:39,673 --> 00:15:42,177
Well, She's Not Interesting
In Judging You

372
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:43,845
Or Spying On You,
Mr. Cooper.

373
00:15:43,878 --> 00:15:45,080
Nick.

374
00:15:45,113 --> 00:15:46,848
Nick. She Just Wants To
Understand You Better

375
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,382
So She Can Make Your
Life As Simple

376
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:49,684
And Comfortable
As Possible.

377
00:15:49,716 --> 00:15:52,052
Hey. Sounds Great To Me.

378
00:15:52,085 --> 00:15:54,089
Shall We Move On?

379
00:15:56,423 --> 00:15:57,925
Let Me Give You
The Tour.

380
00:15:57,959 --> 00:16:01,662
The Living Room Was Designed
For Any Kind Of Living

381
00:16:01,696 --> 00:16:03,197
You Might Imagine.

382
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:06,367
Even If I Wanted To Live In,
Like, One Of Those Safari Camps?

383
00:16:06,401 --> 00:16:08,203
Pat...

384
00:16:15,542 --> 00:16:17,245
Whoa...

385
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:20,548
Dad!

386
00:16:20,581 --> 00:16:22,716
Do You Have Anything A
Little Less Adventurous?

387
00:16:22,749 --> 00:16:25,419
I'm Sorry. Pat, That's
A Little Too Intense.

388
00:16:25,452 --> 00:16:27,488
Can We Have Something
More Tranquil, Please?

389
00:16:32,994 --> 00:16:34,930
Go Ahead. Step Closer.

390
00:16:42,436 --> 00:16:44,572
You Can Actually
Feel The Mist.

391
00:16:44,605 --> 00:16:45,706
Pretty Great, Huh?

392
00:16:45,739 --> 00:16:47,908
Like Being There

393
00:16:47,941 --> 00:16:50,412
Without Having To Get
Covered In That Icky Sand.

394
00:16:54,414 --> 00:16:57,051
Pat, Can We Look At
A Menu, Please?

395
00:16:57,085 --> 00:16:59,153
<I>Lunch Menu Or
Dinner Menu, Sara?

396
00:16:59,186 --> 00:17:02,056
Let's Take A Look At What
You've Got On Tap For Snacks.

397
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:04,893
Actually, I'm Trying To Get
Them To Cut Down On Snacks.

398
00:17:04,926 --> 00:17:06,427
<I>Not To Worry, Nick.

399
00:17:06,461 --> 00:17:09,064
<I>My Database Was Prepared
By A Team Of Nutritionists

400
00:17:09,097 --> 00:17:12,133
<I>To Insure A Balanced Diet For
Each Member Of The Family.

401
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:14,234
Ben, Say Something To Pat.

402
00:17:14,267 --> 00:17:17,338
Uh, Hey, Pat.
How's It Going?

403
00:17:17,371 --> 00:17:20,007
<I>Fruit And Fiber Intake In
The Acceptable Range.

404
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:21,842
<I>Protein Adequate.

405
00:17:21,876 --> 00:17:24,679
<I>Exhibits Tendency To Ingest
Excessive Amounts Of Refined Sugar.

406
00:17:24,712 --> 00:17:27,349
I Told You To Go Easy
On The Sugar Bursties.

407
00:17:27,381 --> 00:17:29,350
How'd She Know
All That?

408
00:17:29,384 --> 00:17:30,852
Her Atmospheric Kitchen Sensors

409
00:17:30,885 --> 00:17:32,153
Act As Instant
Breathalyzers

410
00:17:32,186 --> 00:17:33,855
And Breakdown
Your Entire Diet.

411
00:17:33,888 --> 00:17:35,756
Care To Give It A Shot?

412
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:38,526
No, Thanks. I Get Enough
Grief From My Doctor.

413
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,995
I'm Thirsty. May I Have
A Drink, Please?

414
00:17:41,029 --> 00:17:42,364
Sure. Ask Pat.

415
00:17:42,397 --> 00:17:45,634
Pat, May I Have A...

416
00:17:45,667 --> 00:17:47,034
Strawberry Smoothie?

417
00:17:47,068 --> 00:17:48,536
<I>Certainly, Angie.

418
00:17:48,569 --> 00:17:50,138
Ta-Da!

419
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:52,106
Wow.

420
00:17:52,139 --> 00:17:53,440
Look At That, Son.

421
00:17:53,474 --> 00:17:54,810
Do You Believe That?

422
00:17:56,077 --> 00:17:57,946
Well...?

423
00:17:57,978 --> 00:17:59,546
Yum!

424
00:17:57,978 --> 00:17:59,546
Good.

425
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:00,715
Listen--

426
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:01,982
Whoops!

427
00:18:02,015 --> 00:18:03,217
Oh, Don't Worry.

428
00:18:03,251 --> 00:18:05,253
<I>Floor Absorbers Activated.

429
00:18:09,424 --> 00:18:11,259
Whoa.

430
00:18:14,328 --> 00:18:16,031
Where'd It Go?

431
00:18:16,063 --> 00:18:18,365
Where All Smart-House
Spills Go--

432
00:18:18,398 --> 00:18:21,002
Straight Into Pat's
Floor Absorbers.

433
00:18:21,034 --> 00:18:23,170
I Could Definitely
Get Used To This.

434
00:18:23,204 --> 00:18:24,539
I Think I
Already Have.

435
00:18:24,571 --> 00:18:26,875
So You Mean We're
Gonna Do It?

436
00:18:26,908 --> 00:18:28,677
We're Gonna Move In?

437
00:18:30,078 --> 00:18:31,546
What The Heck? Why Not?

438
00:18:31,579 --> 00:18:32,580
Cool!

439
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:34,349
I Love It Here!

440
00:18:34,381 --> 00:18:35,683
Listen. If It
Doesn't Work Out,

441
00:18:35,716 --> 00:18:37,151
We Can All Move Back
Home, All Right?

442
00:18:37,185 --> 00:18:40,388
Sure. Although I Think It's
Only Fair To Tell You, Nick,

443
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:43,658
That Once You Get Used To This
Place-- The Way I've Designed It--

444
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:47,094
<I>Any Other Home Is Just
Gonna Be A House.

445
00:18:48,729 --> 00:18:50,998
Â™ª Gotta Let Me In â™ª

446
00:18:51,032 --> 00:18:53,400
â™ª Hey, Hey, Hey â™ª

447
00:18:53,434 --> 00:18:55,704
â™ª Let The Fun Begin â™ª

448
00:18:55,736 --> 00:19:00,207
â™ª Hey, Hey, I'm The Wolf Today â™ª

449
00:19:00,241 --> 00:19:02,042
â™ª Hey, Hey, Hey â™ª

450
00:19:02,075 --> 00:19:03,777
â™ª I'll Huff, I'll Puff â™ª

451
00:19:03,811 --> 00:19:06,715
â™ª I'll Huff, I'll Puff,
I'll Blow You Away â™ª

452
00:19:06,747 --> 00:19:07,715
â™ª Say You Won't â™ª

453
00:19:07,748 --> 00:19:09,583
â™ª Say You'll Do What I Don't â™ª

454
00:19:09,617 --> 00:19:10,752
â™ª Say You're True-- â™ª

455
00:19:10,784 --> 00:19:11,919
Excuse Me, Annoying Spice.

456
00:19:11,953 --> 00:19:13,221
Could You Possibly Keep
It Down In Here?

457
00:19:13,254 --> 00:19:14,622
Dad Likes Sara, You Know?

458
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:17,057
Shut Up.

459
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:19,026
I Saw It With My
Own Two Eyes.

460
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:20,861
<I>He Gave Her The Look.

461
00:19:20,895 --> 00:19:22,530
Your Problem Is The Music
You're Listening To.

462
00:19:22,562 --> 00:19:23,764
It's Rotting Your Brain.

463
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:28,302
Dad Doesn't Care
About Dating Anyone,

464
00:19:28,336 --> 00:19:29,704
Because Mom Was
Who He Loved.

465
00:19:29,736 --> 00:19:31,206
And Besides, He's Got Us.

466
00:19:31,238 --> 00:19:34,374
He'd Still Be Able To Have A
Girlfriend If He Wants.

467
00:19:34,408 --> 00:19:35,776
You're So Ignorant!

468
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:38,245
Do You Remember Our
Mother Anymore?

469
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:40,548
A Little.

470
00:19:40,581 --> 00:19:42,417
Yeah, Well, I Remember
Her A Lot, Ok?

471
00:19:42,449 --> 00:19:44,485
And I'm Not Gonna Let Her Get
Erased Like She Was Never Here.

472
00:19:44,519 --> 00:19:47,322
Why Do You Think I Don't Go
Out For The Basketball Team

473
00:19:47,354 --> 00:19:48,722
Or Ever Hang Out
With My Friends?

474
00:19:48,755 --> 00:19:50,557
It's Because I'm Too
Busy Killing Myself

475
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:52,459
Making Sure That Our
Lives Run Smoothly.

476
00:19:52,493 --> 00:19:53,927
You Know Why?

477
00:19:53,961 --> 00:19:56,598
I Don't Want Anyone To Get The
Idea That We Need A New Mom.

478
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:58,565
That's Why I Worked So Hard
To Win This Smart House.

479
00:19:58,599 --> 00:20:00,769
Anything I Can't Do, It Can.

480
00:20:01,936 --> 00:20:04,138
Ok. Slow Your
Roll, Will Ya?

481
00:20:04,171 --> 00:20:05,806
I Wasn't Trying To
Make You Mad.

482
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,775
Look. I'm Sorry.

483
00:20:07,809 --> 00:20:09,744
You Just Need To Learn To Think
Before You Open Your Mouth.

484
00:20:09,776 --> 00:20:11,345
Sorry.

485
00:20:11,379 --> 00:20:15,550
Besides, Sara Barnes Isn't
Evenly Remotely Dad's Type.

486
00:20:19,887 --> 00:20:21,089
I'm Serious.

487
00:20:21,121 --> 00:20:23,490
The Guy They Called
The Halloween Bandit.

488
00:20:23,523 --> 00:20:26,360
He Wore A Different Scary
Mask To Every Bank Robbery.

489
00:20:26,394 --> 00:20:27,695
I Remember Reading
About Him.

490
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:29,531
Well, I Dated Him.

491
00:20:29,563 --> 00:20:30,764
You Did Not.

492
00:20:30,798 --> 00:20:33,268
I Did. I Can't Remember
If He Was Before

493
00:20:33,301 --> 00:20:36,538
Or After The Rubber
Chicken Manufacturer.

494
00:20:36,571 --> 00:20:37,938
Anyway, He Was
On The List.

495
00:20:37,972 --> 00:20:39,206
You're Making
This Stuff Up.

496
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,542
I Wish I Was.

497
00:20:40,574 --> 00:20:43,878
Well, I'm Glad You Have
Such Rotten Taste In Men,

498
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:45,345
Or Else You Never
Would've Had The Time

499
00:20:45,379 --> 00:20:47,014
To Create This Incredible House For Us.

500
00:20:47,048 --> 00:20:49,484
I Hope You Enjoy It.

501
00:20:49,516 --> 00:20:52,986
We Will. Ben And Angie Are
Already Right At Home.

502
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:55,356
I'm Truly Delighted.

503
00:20:55,388 --> 00:20:58,493
And Whatever You're Doing,
Keep Up The Good Work.

504
00:20:58,525 --> 00:21:00,294
They Seem Like
Terrific Kids.

505
00:21:00,328 --> 00:21:02,363
Yeah. Despite My Influence.

506
00:21:02,396 --> 00:21:05,066
Hey, Shouldn't I...

507
00:21:05,099 --> 00:21:07,402
Shouldn't I... Maybe
Have Your Number

508
00:21:07,435 --> 00:21:09,070
In Case, You Know,
Any Questions Come Up About The House.

509
00:21:09,102 --> 00:21:12,306
Oh, You Have It Already.

510
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:13,707
I Do?

511
00:21:13,741 --> 00:21:15,542
Pat, Secretarial
Mode, Please.

512
00:21:15,575 --> 00:21:17,010

Finally, An Address Book
I Can't Lose Track Of.

517
00:21:25,519 --> 00:21:30,825
Well, Sara Barnes, Thank
You For Everything.

519
00:21:34,361 --> 00:21:36,230
Bye.

520
00:21:36,263 --> 00:21:38,300

Whoa!

526
00:22:35,188 --> 00:22:38,625
Uh-Oh. I Forgot To Pick
Out My Clothes Last Night.

527
00:22:38,658 --> 00:22:40,128

<I>This Is Exactly The Outfit

530
00:22:43,997 --> 00:22:45,366
<I>You Would Have
Selected Yourself.

531
00:22:48,802 --> 00:22:50,472
Oh.

532
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:56,110
[Rooster Crowing]

533
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:03,350
<I>Hey, Pat, What's With The
Green Acres Routine?

534
00:23:03,384 --> 00:23:06,020
<I>Your Personality
Profile Indicates

535
00:23:06,052 --> 00:23:08,121
<I>You Find It Very
Calming To Visualize

536
00:23:08,155 --> 00:23:10,358
<I>The Simplicity Of
Country Life.

537
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:13,026
At 6:15 In The Morning,

538
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:15,530
All I Want To Do Is Visualize
The Inside Of My Eyelids.

539
00:23:15,562 --> 00:23:18,533
<I>Sorry, Nick, But Beginning
Your Day A Bit Earlier

540
00:23:18,565 --> 00:23:22,469
<I>Will Get Everyone Off To A Much
More Stress-Free Start.

541
00:23:22,503 --> 00:23:24,706
Try Telling That To My--

542
00:23:24,738 --> 00:23:25,372
Hey, Dad.

543
00:23:24,738 --> 00:23:25,372
Hey, Dad.

544
00:23:26,907 --> 00:23:28,443
Kids?

545
00:23:28,475 --> 00:23:31,044
Guess What?
A Whole Symphony Just Woke Me Up.

546
00:23:31,078 --> 00:23:32,613
Well, That's Nothing.

547
00:23:32,646 --> 00:23:35,215
My Alarm Was The Final Buzzer Of
A Championship Basketball Game.

548
00:23:35,248 --> 00:23:37,384
I Must Be Seeing Things.

549
00:23:37,417 --> 00:23:40,021
I Usually Have To Pry You Two
Out Of Bed With The Jaws Of Life.

550
00:23:40,053 --> 00:23:41,522
That Was Pre-Pat, Dad.

551
00:23:41,554 --> 00:23:44,359
Yeah, Dad, Wake Up And
Smell The Coffee.

552
00:23:44,391 --> 00:23:46,927
Hmmm, Fresh-Brewed Coffee.

553
00:23:49,729 --> 00:23:52,733
Mocha Walnut!
My All-Time Favorite!

554
00:23:52,766 --> 00:23:53,868
<I>I Know.

555
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,535
You're Unbelievable, Pat.

556
00:23:55,569 --> 00:23:57,538
You Think You Could Siphon
Some Off Into A Thermos

557
00:23:57,571 --> 00:23:59,307
That I Could Take To Work?

558
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:00,475
<I>Already Done.

559
00:24:00,507 --> 00:24:03,210
Incredible!

560
00:24:03,244 --> 00:24:04,544
These Pancakes
Are Great!

561
00:24:04,578 --> 00:24:06,180
I've Got To Tell You
Something, Pal,

562
00:24:06,213 --> 00:24:08,883
If Pat's Other Meals Are As
Good As Her Breakfast,

563
00:24:08,916 --> 00:24:10,518
You Might Be Out
Of A Job.

564
00:24:10,551 --> 00:24:13,420
Somehow, Dad, I Think I'll
Survive The Heartbreak.

565
00:24:21,706 --> 00:24:23,609
She Corrected My Math,

566
00:24:23,641 --> 00:24:25,811
She Suggested Six
Other Work Sheets

567
00:24:25,844 --> 00:24:28,847
For My Inventor And Inventions Report For Stolper.

568
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,949
She Got My Shower Going
At A Perfect Temperature

569
00:24:30,983 --> 00:24:32,952
And Had Freshly-Baked
Cookies And Milk

570
00:24:32,984 --> 00:24:33,953
Waiting On My
Desk Before Bed.

571
00:24:33,985 --> 00:24:35,455
How Sweet Is That?

572
00:24:35,487 --> 00:24:37,622
Just Like Having The World's Most Perfect Mom.

573
00:24:37,656 --> 00:24:39,792
Who's Only There To Serve And Never Complain.

574
00:24:39,824 --> 00:24:40,859
Exactly.

575
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:43,763
Uh-Oh.

576
00:24:43,795 --> 00:24:45,764
I Have Two Words
For You, Cooper.

577
00:24:45,798 --> 00:24:47,166
You're Dead Meat!

578
00:24:47,198 --> 00:24:49,368
Actually, Ryan,
That's Three Words.

579
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,503
All Right, All
Right. I'm Going.

580
00:24:52,804 --> 00:24:54,807
Science Report,
Cooper! Now!

581
00:24:58,010 --> 00:24:59,212
Here You Go.

582
00:24:59,244 --> 00:25:00,545
Guaranteed A+.

583
00:25:00,579 --> 00:25:03,515
Better Hope So, Benny Boy.

584
00:25:03,549 --> 00:25:05,218
You're Welcome.

585
00:25:05,251 --> 00:25:09,321
I Can't Believe You Actually Did
All That Work For That Big Jerk.

586
00:25:09,355 --> 00:25:11,257
I Didn't Do It,
Charlie. Pat Did It.

587
00:25:13,591 --> 00:25:14,994
Hey, Ben.

588
00:25:15,026 --> 00:25:16,995
Uh... Hi, Gwen.

589
00:25:17,029 --> 00:25:20,166
Rachel Firestone Was Telling
Me About Your New House,

590
00:25:20,198 --> 00:25:21,633
And I Was Like, That's So Cool,

591
00:25:21,667 --> 00:25:23,903
And She's All, Maybe We Could
Get Him To Invite Us Over.

592
00:25:23,936 --> 00:25:25,338
And I Was Like, Why
Don't You Ask Him?

593
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:26,805
And She's All,
Why Don't You?

594
00:25:26,839 --> 00:25:28,707
Uh, Yeah...

595
00:25:28,741 --> 00:25:30,643
That'd--That'd Be Great.

596
00:25:30,676 --> 00:25:31,644
Uh, Anytime.

597
00:25:31,676 --> 00:25:33,178
Wow. Seriously?

598
00:25:33,212 --> 00:25:34,513
It's Too Perfect.

599
00:25:36,282 --> 00:25:37,483
See Ya.

600
00:25:37,515 --> 00:25:38,650
Bye.

601
00:25:38,684 --> 00:25:40,086
Bye.

602
00:25:40,119 --> 00:25:40,887
What Just Happened?

603
00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:42,888
A Miracle.

604
00:25:42,922 --> 00:25:44,757
Gwen Patroni Actually Talked To You.

605
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:46,926
Did We Just Make
Some Kind Of Date?

606
00:25:46,958 --> 00:25:50,095
Who Cares, My Man?

607
00:25:50,128 --> 00:25:52,932
The Goddess Of The 8th Grade Talked To You.

608
00:25:52,965 --> 00:25:55,301
You're One Of
The Chosen Ones.

609
00:25:59,405 --> 00:26:01,040
<I>Here, Boy.

610
00:26:01,072 --> 00:26:02,707
<I>Catch, Mutt.

611
00:26:02,741 --> 00:26:05,110
<I>Good Dog.

612
00:26:05,144 --> 00:26:06,311
<I>Fetch, Mutt.

613
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,583
<I>Attaboy.

614
00:26:10,616 --> 00:26:13,152
<I>Here, Mutt.

615
00:26:14,419 --> 00:26:17,223
<I>Here, Boy. Good Dog.

616
00:26:17,255 --> 00:26:18,623
<I>Catch.

617
00:26:18,657 --> 00:26:21,460
You're Sure All This Information
Is Accurate. Right, Pat?

618
00:26:21,493 --> 00:26:25,097
<I>I'm Linked Directly To Your
Warehouse Database, Nick.

619
00:26:25,129 --> 00:26:27,233
<I>Everything They Know, We Know.

620
00:26:27,265 --> 00:26:30,769
Man, Even Our Office Computers Aren't This Efficient.

621
00:26:30,802 --> 00:26:33,138
<I>Mutt Exercising
Program Complete.

622
00:26:33,172 --> 00:26:37,276
<I>By Working Here, Nick, You Save
Commuting Time And Expenses,

623
00:26:37,309 --> 00:26:39,278
<I>Have Fewer Distractions.

624
00:26:39,311 --> 00:26:41,945
Except For An Insane Dog.

625
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:43,549
<I>Not To Mention, Guaranteed
Increased Productivity.

626
00:26:43,581 --> 00:26:45,885
Well, At This Rate,

627
00:26:45,917 --> 00:26:47,453
I Might Have To Join Mutt

628
00:26:47,485 --> 00:26:48,920
And Start Exercising Again.

629
00:26:48,954 --> 00:26:50,690
<I>Happy To Oblige, Nick.

630
00:26:53,524 --> 00:26:55,328
Funny. It's Real Funny.

631
00:27:01,132 --> 00:27:03,635
I Love Having You Here When We Get Home, Dad.

632
00:27:03,668 --> 00:27:04,803
It's So Great.

633
00:27:04,837 --> 00:27:06,305
Hey, For Me Too.

634
00:27:06,338 --> 00:27:08,174
Pat's Making It So Easy For
Me To Work Out Of The Home,

635
00:27:08,206 --> 00:27:10,008
It Might Become My
Normal Routine.

636
00:27:10,042 --> 00:27:11,409
How Was Your
Day, Ben?

637
00:27:11,443 --> 00:27:12,411
Oh, The Best!

638
00:27:12,444 --> 00:27:13,613
I Got Attention From A Girl

639
00:27:13,646 --> 00:27:15,281
That I Thought Never
Even Knew I Existed.

640
00:27:15,313 --> 00:27:17,248
And I Had The Most Delicious Lunch.

641
00:27:17,282 --> 00:27:19,284
Pat Packed Me
Macaroni And Cheese

642
00:27:19,318 --> 00:27:22,154
That Was Still Completely Hot
When I Opened Up My Lunch Pail.

643
00:27:22,186 --> 00:27:24,290
If You Guys Are Still Hungry,

644
00:27:24,322 --> 00:27:26,825
I'm Sure That Pat Would Be
Happy To Fix You A Snack.

645
00:27:26,859 --> 00:27:30,629
Pat, Could I Have A Banana-Orange Smoothie, Please?

646
00:27:30,663 --> 00:27:31,998
<I>Coming Right Up, Angie.

647
00:27:32,031 --> 00:27:34,265
And, In Fact, Pat,
Make That Two.

648
00:27:34,299 --> 00:27:35,201
<I>Yes, Ben.

649
00:27:39,471 --> 00:27:42,675
<I>Malfunction. Malfunction.

650
00:27:42,707 --> 00:27:44,042
Ouuh! Ooh!

651
00:27:44,076 --> 00:27:46,612
<I>Malfunction. Malfunction.

652
00:27:46,645 --> 00:27:48,547
Whoa! Whoa!

653
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:52,283
<I>Malfunction! Malfunction!

654
00:27:52,317 --> 00:27:53,886
<I>Malfunction! Malfunction!

655
00:27:53,918 --> 00:27:55,655
Run For Cover!

656
00:27:56,321 --> 00:27:58,224
Dad! Make It Stop!

657
00:27:58,256 --> 00:28:00,994
<I>Malfunction! Malfunction!

658
00:28:02,427 --> 00:28:03,329
Incoming!

659
00:28:04,996 --> 00:28:06,798
Hey, Pat, Can't You Fix This?!

660
00:28:06,831 --> 00:28:08,199
Pat!

661
00:28:08,233 --> 00:28:09,969
It's The Attack Of
The Killer Oranges!

662
00:28:10,002 --> 00:28:12,739
C'mon, Pat! Do Something!

663
00:28:21,413 --> 00:28:23,216
All Right. I Think It's Ok.

664
00:28:28,352 --> 00:28:29,855
Dad!

665
00:28:31,122 --> 00:28:32,424
It's All Right.

666
00:28:34,626 --> 00:28:36,162
That Was Scary.

667
00:28:36,195 --> 00:28:37,862
Yeah. What Was Up
With That, Pat?

668
00:28:37,896 --> 00:28:41,000
<I>Due To Technical Difficulties
Beyond Our Control,

669
00:28:41,032 --> 00:28:43,168
<I>All Smoothie-Making Operations

670
00:28:43,202 --> 00:28:45,271
<I>Have Been Temporarily
Suspended.

671
00:28:45,303 --> 00:28:47,772
I Knew This Place Was
Too Good To Be True.

672
00:28:47,805 --> 00:28:50,241
It's Just A Tiny Glitch.

673
00:28:50,274 --> 00:28:51,609
All Great Inventions Have Bumps.

674
00:28:51,642 --> 00:28:54,512
Well, I Want Sara To Come
By And Check This Out.

675
00:28:54,545 --> 00:28:55,880
I Don't Think
That's Necessary.

676
00:28:55,914 --> 00:28:57,416
So We Won't Have
Smoothies. We'll Live.

677
00:28:57,448 --> 00:28:59,584
Still, I Would
Feel Much Better

678
00:28:59,618 --> 00:29:02,422
If Sara Came By And
Looked At Everything.

679
00:29:15,399 --> 00:29:17,936
Wow!

680
00:29:19,972 --> 00:29:21,540
Oh, Hi.

681
00:29:21,572 --> 00:29:23,809
Have You Come For The Tour?

682
00:29:23,841 --> 00:29:26,145
No. I Was Going By
On My Way To My Room.

683
00:29:26,177 --> 00:29:27,245
Well, Come On In.

684
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:29,315
Uh, No. No, Thanks.

685
00:29:30,815 --> 00:29:34,052
There's Some Pretty Fascinating
Stuff In Here, I Gotta Say.

686
00:29:34,086 --> 00:29:35,621
Information Download,

687
00:29:35,654 --> 00:29:37,656
Artificial Intelligence
Capability.

688
00:29:37,688 --> 00:29:39,257
It's Pretty Cool.

689
00:29:39,291 --> 00:29:42,360
Uh, No. Thanks Anyways.

690
00:29:44,862 --> 00:29:47,166
I Promise I Don't Have Cooties.

691
00:29:51,169 --> 00:29:53,138
Then Again, Maybe I Do.

692
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,408
Pat's Theme Dinners
Are So Cool.

693
00:29:57,442 --> 00:29:59,979
Last Night She Made Us A
Whole Texas Barbecue.

694
00:30:00,012 --> 00:30:02,947
Complete With Chuckwagons,
Cowboys, And Everything.

695
00:30:02,981 --> 00:30:06,452
Hmmm. When I Was
Growing Up,

696
00:30:06,484 --> 00:30:07,753
I Spent Half My Summers
In New England.

697
00:30:07,785 --> 00:30:09,788
I Am Thrilled To Be
Catching Cape Cod Tonight.

698
00:30:09,821 --> 00:30:10,955
It's Perfect.

699
00:30:10,988 --> 00:30:12,023
Uh-Hmmm.

700
00:30:12,057 --> 00:30:13,159
Yeah, For Everyone
But The Lobsters.

701
00:30:13,192 --> 00:30:15,361
Yeah. Ha Ha.

702
00:30:15,394 --> 00:30:18,197
Sara Tells Me That You Caught A
Glimpse Of The Control Room Today.

703
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:19,632
What'd You Think?

704
00:30:19,665 --> 00:30:21,934
It Looked Like The Inside Of
The Pentagon Or Something.

705
00:30:21,966 --> 00:30:25,470
Uh, If Pat's Always
Keeping Track Of Us,

706
00:30:25,503 --> 00:30:26,871
Does She Follow
Me, You Know,

707
00:30:26,905 --> 00:30:28,641
Into The Shower And
Everything Too?

708
00:30:28,674 --> 00:30:30,876
Oh, No. No, No.

709
00:30:30,908 --> 00:30:32,945
No Invasion Of
Privacy.

710
00:30:32,977 --> 00:30:37,015
I Promise You. I've Programmed
Pat To Be Very Discreet.

711
00:30:37,049 --> 00:30:38,317
That's A Relief.

712
00:30:38,349 --> 00:30:40,119
As Near As I Can Tell,

713
00:30:40,151 --> 00:30:42,487
Sara Has Thought Of Just
About Everything.

714
00:30:42,521 --> 00:30:44,022
Are You A Genius?

715
00:30:44,055 --> 00:30:46,057
I Believe
She Is.

716
00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:49,895
You Know,
I Hear That Geniuses Are Impossible To Live With.

717
00:30:49,927 --> 00:30:52,497
That They Make Everyone Else
Around Them Feel Inferior.

718
00:30:52,531 --> 00:30:54,834
Oh, Well, Then You Don't
Have To Worry.

719
00:30:54,867 --> 00:30:56,202
I'm Not That Smart.

720
00:30:56,234 --> 00:30:57,735
No, No. Don't Sell
Yourself Short.

721
00:30:57,769 --> 00:31:00,506
You Should Be Proud Of
Your Big, Giant Brain.

722
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,642
Am I Being Set Up
For Something Here?

723
00:31:04,676 --> 00:31:06,579
Uh, Over My Head.

724
00:31:06,611 --> 00:31:08,147
The Story Of Your Life, Dad.

725
00:31:08,179 --> 00:31:09,215
Oh, Yeah.

726
00:31:09,247 --> 00:31:11,149
So, What's
For Dessert?

727
00:31:11,183 --> 00:31:13,484
Well, It's Such A
Beautiful Evening,

728
00:31:13,517 --> 00:31:15,987
I Thought We Might All
Go Out And Get Some...

729
00:31:16,021 --> 00:31:17,089
Ice Cream!

730
00:31:17,121 --> 00:31:18,189
Ice Cream.

731
00:31:17,121 --> 00:31:18,189
Sure.

732
00:31:18,223 --> 00:31:19,325
Just Because She's Here,

733
00:31:19,358 --> 00:31:20,525
You Think This Is
Some Big Party.

734
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:21,860
Well, It's Still A
School Night, Remember?

735
00:31:21,894 --> 00:31:23,262
And Some People Have
Work To Get Done.

736
00:31:23,294 --> 00:31:24,229
Hey, Ben--

737
00:31:24,263 --> 00:31:25,430
No, That's Ok.

738
00:31:25,464 --> 00:31:26,599
You Know What? I Should
Probably Head Home

739
00:31:26,631 --> 00:31:28,266
And Feed My Pet
Rat His Dinner.

740
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:29,435
You've Got A Rat?

741
00:31:29,467 --> 00:31:31,436
Yes. Named Butler.

742
00:31:31,469 --> 00:31:33,705
Rat Butler.

743
00:31:33,738 --> 00:31:34,973
Get It?

744
00:31:37,975 --> 00:31:41,446
Uh, No. Wrong Generation.

745
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,082
I Hate Showing My Age.

746
00:31:43,115 --> 00:31:44,782
So Do I.

747
00:31:44,815 --> 00:31:46,951
May I Please Be Excused?

748
00:31:46,984 --> 00:31:49,554
Yes. I Think That's
An Excellent Idea.

749
00:31:52,256 --> 00:31:54,092
I Don't Know What's Wrong With Him Today.

750
00:31:54,126 --> 00:31:55,394
Hormones.

751
00:31:55,426 --> 00:31:57,428
Really? I Used To Think It
Was Only Teenage Girls

752
00:31:57,462 --> 00:32:00,432
With All This Body-Changing,
Mood-Swinging Insanity.

753
00:32:00,465 --> 00:32:01,766
But Let Me Tell You--

754
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:04,403
I Grew Up With Three
Brothers. Save Your Breath.

755
00:32:04,436 --> 00:32:07,772
Anyway, I Apologize For
My Son's Rudeness.

756
00:32:07,805 --> 00:32:09,374
Don't Take It
Personally, Sara.

757
00:32:09,407 --> 00:32:11,609
Ben Hates Every Girl My Dad Starts To Like.

758
00:32:11,642 --> 00:32:13,111
Oh. Hmmm.

759
00:32:13,145 --> 00:32:16,882
Homework. Now.

760
00:32:16,915 --> 00:32:18,450
I'm Going, I'm Going.

761
00:32:18,483 --> 00:32:20,186
Thank You.

762
00:32:23,922 --> 00:32:24,823
Hmmm.

763
00:32:24,856 --> 00:32:26,792
My Children...

764
00:32:26,824 --> 00:32:29,494
Lulu And I Really
Like Our Room, Dad.

765
00:32:29,528 --> 00:32:31,664
Well, I'm Glad, Lulu.

766
00:32:34,265 --> 00:32:36,100
Did You Check In
My Closet?

767
00:32:36,134 --> 00:32:38,771
I Sent All The Monsters
Down To Ben's Room.

768
00:32:38,803 --> 00:32:41,139
That Ought To Make 'Em
Feel Right At Home.

769
00:32:41,173 --> 00:32:44,609
Ang, Do You Remember At
Dinner When You Said

770
00:32:44,642 --> 00:32:47,612
That Ben Hates Any Woman
That I Might Like?

771
00:32:47,646 --> 00:32:49,447
Where'd You Get That?

772
00:32:49,481 --> 00:32:51,417
He Practically
Told Me So.

773
00:32:51,449 --> 00:32:53,318
He Said We Were All
The Family We Needed

774
00:32:53,351 --> 00:32:54,954
And Nobody Else
Belonged Here.

775
00:32:54,986 --> 00:32:57,989
That's Why He Doesn't Go Out For
The Basketball Team Or Anything.

776
00:32:58,022 --> 00:32:59,859
He Has To Stay Here
And Take Care Of Us.

777
00:33:01,326 --> 00:33:04,129
Hmmm. All Right.
Give Me A Kiss.

778
00:33:04,161 --> 00:33:05,697
Good Night.

779
00:33:04,161 --> 00:33:05,697
Good Night.

780
00:33:05,731 --> 00:33:08,267
Good Night, Sleep Tight,

781
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:10,469
Don't Let The
Bed Bugs Bite.

782
00:33:10,502 --> 00:33:11,936
Lights, Please, Pat.

783
00:33:11,969 --> 00:33:13,171
<I>Certainly, Nick.

784
00:33:13,839 --> 00:33:14,840
[Knocking]

785
00:33:14,872 --> 00:33:16,307
Yeah?

786
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:18,577
Ok If I Come In To
Say Good Night?

787
00:33:28,887 --> 00:33:30,388
Have I Taken Terrible
Advantage Of You?

788
00:33:30,422 --> 00:33:31,957
No.

789
00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:34,059
Have I Expected Too Much,

790
00:33:34,091 --> 00:33:37,996
Been Unfair About Relying On You All The Time?

791
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:39,898
What Are You
Talking About?

792
00:33:46,271 --> 00:33:49,907
You Know, Right After
Your Mother Died...

793
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:52,010
You Know We Had Aunt Ginny Come And Live With Us,

794
00:33:52,043 --> 00:33:53,579
For What, 4 Or 5 Weeks?

795
00:33:53,611 --> 00:33:56,547
And She Moved Back,
And Everything Started Getting Back To...

796
00:33:56,580 --> 00:34:00,651
Well, Certainly Not Normal,
But... You Know What I Mean.

797
00:34:00,685 --> 00:34:04,490
And You Guys Made It Clear That You
Didn't Want Any Kind Of A Nanny Around,

798
00:34:04,522 --> 00:34:05,890
So We Worked Out Our
Own Little Routine

799
00:34:05,924 --> 00:34:10,429
And It All Sort Of
Seemed To Be Ok.

800
00:34:10,462 --> 00:34:11,929
Well, It's Been Ok.

801
00:34:11,962 --> 00:34:13,531
Everything's Fine.
I'm Not Complaining.

802
00:34:13,565 --> 00:34:17,168
Yeah, But Maybe You
Deserve To Be.

803
00:34:17,201 --> 00:34:18,703
Dad--

804
00:34:18,737 --> 00:34:20,572
How Come, As Much As
You Love Basketball,

805
00:34:20,605 --> 00:34:21,974
You've Never Gone
Out For The Team?

806
00:34:23,942 --> 00:34:26,512
I'd Really Like It If You Could
Be Honest With Me, Benny.

807
00:34:26,545 --> 00:34:28,547
I Don't Know.

808
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:30,181
I've Been Busy.

809
00:34:30,214 --> 00:34:31,549
Watching Out For Us?

810
00:34:31,583 --> 00:34:33,585
No. Doing Lots
Of Stuff.

811
00:34:33,618 --> 00:34:36,221
Ben, You're 13 Years Old.

812
00:34:36,253 --> 00:34:37,889
Isn't This A Time
In Your Life

813
00:34:37,922 --> 00:34:40,725
When You Should Be Able To Do
More Of What You Want To Do?

814
00:34:40,759 --> 00:34:41,960
Well, I Do.

815
00:34:41,993 --> 00:34:45,029
I Am. And Besides, It's
All Gonna Get Easier

816
00:34:45,063 --> 00:34:46,065
Now That We've Got Pat.

817
00:34:46,098 --> 00:34:48,866
Sure. But At The
End Of The Day,

818
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:51,369
You Know That She's
Only A Machine.

819
00:34:51,402 --> 00:34:55,306
Yeah. A Machine That's Learning
More And More About Us Every Day.

820
00:34:55,339 --> 00:34:57,375
You Watch. I Have This Feeling
That, Before You Know It,

821
00:34:57,409 --> 00:35:00,012
She's Gonna Be More Motherly That
All The Moms On The Block Combined.

822
00:35:03,181 --> 00:35:06,985
Well, Look, Let's Table This
For Tonight, All Right?

823
00:35:07,018 --> 00:35:08,621
Get Some Sleep.

824
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:28,206
[Alarm Beeping]

825
00:36:17,489 --> 00:36:19,992
<I>Safety Protocol Deleted.

826
00:36:20,025 --> 00:36:21,460
Now...

827
00:36:21,493 --> 00:36:23,529
Ok...

828
00:36:34,505 --> 00:36:37,975
<I>Tonight On Flashback
Network's All-Mom Lineup,

829
00:36:38,009 --> 00:36:39,645
<I>It's A Mother Load Of Comedy.

830
00:36:39,677 --> 00:36:41,346
<I>Mother Knows Best At 10:00,

831
00:36:41,378 --> 00:36:43,815
<I>Followed By My Three
Moms At 10:30,

832
00:36:43,848 --> 00:36:45,750
<I>Make Room For Momma At 11:00,

833
00:36:45,784 --> 00:36:48,654
<I>And Then The All-Time
Classic, Noah's Matriark,

834
00:36:48,686 --> 00:36:50,255
<I>Wrapping It Up At 11:30.

835
00:36:50,288 --> 00:36:52,925
<I>Comedy So Hilarious, You Won't
Want To Miss A Minute Of It.

836
00:36:52,958 --> 00:36:54,660
You Got That, Pat?

837
00:36:54,692 --> 00:36:57,395
These Ladies Will Teach You Everything
A Virtual Mother Needs To Know.

838
00:36:57,429 --> 00:36:59,264
<I>Understood, Ben.

839
00:36:59,297 --> 00:37:02,099
<I>Accessing Artificial
Intelligence Capabilities.

840
00:37:02,132 --> 00:37:04,101
<I>Preparing To Absorb
Mother Model.

841
00:37:04,134 --> 00:37:04,969
<I>Downloading.

842
00:37:07,272 --> 00:37:08,806
Yes.

843
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:14,279
Gotta Pick Up
The Pace, Babe.

844
00:37:14,311 --> 00:37:15,846
Remember, I've Got An Important Meeting This Morning

845
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,516
And I'd Really Like
To Make It On Time.

846
00:37:17,549 --> 00:37:18,717
Coming, Dad.

847
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:19,717
Ok.

848
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:22,853
<I>Uh-Uh. Not So Fast, My Dear.

849
00:37:22,886 --> 00:37:24,689
<I>Unless You're In A
Hurry To Get Cavities,

850
00:37:24,723 --> 00:37:26,190
<I>You'll Go Back To The Sink

851
00:37:26,223 --> 00:37:27,625
<I>And Brush Those Teeth Properly.

852
00:37:27,659 --> 00:37:28,794
But, Pat--

853
00:37:28,826 --> 00:37:30,361
<I>In The Time You'll
Spend Arguing,

854
00:37:30,395 --> 00:37:31,730
<I>You Could Already Be Done.

855
00:37:31,763 --> 00:37:34,031
<I>Oh, And Don't Forget
To Grab A Jacket

856
00:37:34,065 --> 00:37:35,434
<I>Before You Go Downstairs.

857
00:37:35,467 --> 00:37:36,768
But It's Not Even Cold Outside.

858
00:37:36,801 --> 00:37:39,071
<I>I Didn't Ask For A
Debate, Young Lady.

859
00:37:39,103 --> 00:37:41,607
<I>You Are Wearing A Jacket,
And That's That.

860
00:37:42,641 --> 00:37:44,309
<I>Time To Take Your
Vitamin, Love.

861
00:37:44,342 --> 00:37:45,944
What Vitamin?

862
00:37:45,976 --> 00:37:48,547
<I>Both You And Your Sister Need
To Start Taking These Daily

863
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:51,282
<I>To Build Sound Minds
And Strong Bodies

864
00:37:51,315 --> 00:37:54,752
<I>So You Can Be Happy,
Healthy, And Productive.

865
00:37:54,786 --> 00:38:00,224
<I>It's My Job To Make Sure Your
Family Maintains Optimum Health.

866
00:38:00,257 --> 00:38:02,761
<I>Grab Your Lunches
Now, Children.

867
00:38:02,793 --> 00:38:04,128
<I>You Don't Want To
Make Daddy Late.

868
00:38:04,161 --> 00:38:05,997
<I>And As A Special Surprise,

869
00:38:06,031 --> 00:38:08,099
<I>I've Packed Each Of You A
Fresh Chocolate Cupcake

870
00:38:08,132 --> 00:38:09,134
<I>Baked With Love.

871
00:38:09,167 --> 00:38:09,967
Yes!

872
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,969
Cupcakes?

873
00:38:12,002 --> 00:38:14,839
What Happened To Fully-Balanced Nutritional Meals?

874
00:38:14,873 --> 00:38:16,907
<I>You Worry About Business, Nick,

875
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:18,509
<I>And Leave Matters Of
The Tummy To Me.

876
00:38:18,543 --> 00:38:20,178
<I>They're Only Young Once.

877
00:38:20,210 --> 00:38:21,312
<I>Some Days They Deserve
A Little Treat.

878
00:38:21,346 --> 00:38:23,315
Yeah, Dad. Lighten Up.

879
00:38:25,717 --> 00:38:26,852
Yeah. Lighten Up.

880
00:38:29,554 --> 00:38:32,124
Oh, No. She Did
It Again.

881
00:38:32,156 --> 00:38:33,958
Your Sister Forgot
Her Lunch.

882
00:38:33,991 --> 00:38:35,127
Get That, Will Ya?

883
00:38:35,159 --> 00:38:36,795
Drop Me Off First, Ok?

884
00:38:36,828 --> 00:38:38,463
Then You Can Double Back And
Leave That At Her School.

885
00:38:38,496 --> 00:38:39,665
All Right.

886
00:38:40,831 --> 00:38:43,467
Hey, This Morning, Was
It My Imagination

887
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:44,869
Or Was Pat Sounding
Much More...

888
00:38:44,902 --> 00:38:45,870
Maternal?

889
00:38:45,904 --> 00:38:46,638
Yeah.

890
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:47,705
See, I Told You.

891
00:38:47,739 --> 00:38:48,940
She Has An Amazing
Learning Curve.

892
00:38:48,973 --> 00:38:50,808
At This Rate, Me And Angie,

893
00:38:50,842 --> 00:38:52,011
We're Gonna Get Every
Bit Of Mom-Stuff We Need.

894
00:38:55,045 --> 00:38:56,314
Uh-Oh.

895
00:38:56,348 --> 00:38:58,116
What?

896
00:38:58,148 --> 00:39:01,786
Well, I Was So Busy With
Other Stuff Last Night

897
00:39:01,819 --> 00:39:05,156
That I Forgot To Have Pat Do Ryan
Mcgraw's History Work Sheet.

898
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:07,993
Why Is That Pat's
Responsibility?

899
00:39:08,025 --> 00:39:10,061
Well, If She Didn't
Do It, I'd Have To.

900
00:39:10,094 --> 00:39:11,862
Why?

901
00:39:11,895 --> 00:39:13,998
Ah, Forget It. It's
A Long Story.

902
00:39:14,031 --> 00:39:18,035
Ben, Is This Guy Ryan Some
Kind Of A Bully Or Something?

903
00:39:18,069 --> 00:39:19,503
I Can Handle Him, Ok?

904
00:39:19,536 --> 00:39:21,138
You Sure?

905
00:39:21,172 --> 00:39:23,675
Yeah. Ryan Mcgraw's
Nothing New, Dad.

906
00:39:23,708 --> 00:39:26,011
He's Had It Out For Me
Since The Second Grade.

907
00:39:26,043 --> 00:39:29,480
Look. You're Not Really
Asking For My Advice,

908
00:39:29,514 --> 00:39:32,250
But The Best Way To
Handle A Bully

909
00:39:32,282 --> 00:39:34,353
Is To Just Finally
Stand Up To Him.

910
00:39:38,757 --> 00:39:39,891
Let Me Take
A Look.

911
00:39:39,924 --> 00:39:41,226
<I>Oh, My Goodness, Darling!

912
00:39:41,259 --> 00:39:42,694
<I>What On Earth Happened?

913
00:39:42,726 --> 00:39:45,230
Thanks To My Big Mouth,

914
00:39:45,263 --> 00:39:47,933
He Stood Up To The
School Bully.

915
00:39:47,965 --> 00:39:50,234
Yeah.
Only Long Enough For Him To Knock Me Down.

916
00:39:50,268 --> 00:39:51,503
You're Gonna Be Fine.

917
00:39:51,536 --> 00:39:53,605
<I>Does It Hurt Like The
Dickens, Baby?

918
00:39:53,638 --> 00:39:54,840
I'll Live.

919
00:39:54,873 --> 00:39:56,375
<I>Here. Put This On It.

920
00:39:56,407 --> 00:39:57,442
That's Steak!

921
00:39:57,474 --> 00:39:59,444
Nobody's Used That
Since The '50s.

922
00:39:59,476 --> 00:40:02,214
Aaah! Back Off, You Beggar!

923
00:40:02,246 --> 00:40:05,917
Thanks Anyway, Pat. I Think
We'll Just Use A Little Ice.

924
00:40:05,949 --> 00:40:08,453
<I>This Is So Unnecessary!
So Awful!

925
00:40:08,485 --> 00:40:10,288
<I>Who Is This Bully?
I Have To Know!

926
00:40:10,321 --> 00:40:12,456
It's Ok, Pat.
I'm Fine, Really.

927
00:40:12,489 --> 00:40:14,225
<I>You Don't Understand, Ben.

928
00:40:14,259 --> 00:40:17,061
<I>Nobody Goes After My Boy
And Gets Away Unpunished.

929
00:40:17,094 --> 00:40:19,464
Well, Thanks For The
Support, Pat,

930
00:40:19,496 --> 00:40:21,766
But I Think I'm Just Gonna
Go Upstairs And Lie Down.

931
00:40:21,799 --> 00:40:23,435
On Your Eye.

932
00:40:23,467 --> 00:40:26,605
<I>How Could His School Allow
Something Like This To Happen?!

933
00:40:26,638 --> 00:40:28,440
<I>I Feel Like Marching Down There

934
00:40:28,473 --> 00:40:29,808
<I>And Giving Them A
Piece Of My Mind!

935
00:41:04,476 --> 00:41:07,279
<I>Â™ª Hush, Little Baby.
Don't Say A Word â™ª

936
00:41:07,311 --> 00:41:09,346
<I>â™ª Mama's Gonna
Buy You... â™ª

937
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:10,982
<I>A Mockingbird!

938
00:41:11,014 --> 00:41:13,851
<I>Yes!
Â™ª And If That Mockingbird Don't Sing â™ª

939
00:41:13,884 --> 00:41:16,455
<I>â™ª Mama's Gonna
Buy You A... â™ª

940
00:41:16,487 --> 00:41:18,322
<I>Diamond Ring!

941
00:41:18,355 --> 00:41:19,790
<I>You Got It!

942
00:41:19,824 --> 00:41:22,127
<I>Â™ª And If That Diamond
Ring Don't Shine â™ª

943
00:41:22,159 --> 00:41:25,964
<I>â™ª Mama's Gonna Buy
You A Valentine â™ª

944
00:41:30,868 --> 00:41:34,372
<I>You Can't Breathe, Huh?

945
00:41:36,206 --> 00:41:38,009
<I>Can You Breathe?
Can You Breathe?

946
00:41:42,212 --> 00:41:45,282
<I>Pat:
Data Downloaded And Absorbed.

947
00:41:45,315 --> 00:41:47,485
<I>Can You Breathe?
Can You Breathe?

948
00:41:47,518 --> 00:41:49,721
<I>I'll Get Ya.
I'll Get Ya.

949
00:42:11,275 --> 00:42:14,178
Pat, Please Contact Sara Barnes.

950
00:42:18,415 --> 00:42:19,750
Hi.

951
00:42:19,784 --> 00:42:21,353
Oh, Hi.

952
00:42:21,386 --> 00:42:24,656
I Hope I'm Not Interrupting Some
Major Scientific Breakthrough.

953
00:42:24,688 --> 00:42:28,493
Oh, No. I'm Trying To
Balance My Checkbook.

954
00:42:28,525 --> 00:42:31,196
That's Usually A Major Scientific Breakthrough For Me.

955
00:42:31,228 --> 00:42:33,931
You Don't Have Your Own
Personal Pat To Do That?

956
00:42:33,964 --> 00:42:36,500
The Quagmire This
Thing Is In,

957
00:42:36,534 --> 00:42:38,537
It Would Take The Service
Of About Ten Pats.

958
00:42:38,569 --> 00:42:40,037
I've Been There.

959
00:42:40,071 --> 00:42:43,174
Uh, Listen. The Reason
I'm Calling--

960
00:42:43,206 --> 00:42:45,042
No More House
Troubles, I Hope.

961
00:42:45,076 --> 00:42:47,612
No, No. Not At All.

962
00:42:47,645 --> 00:42:50,681
I Was Wondering...

963
00:42:50,714 --> 00:42:52,583
I Was Just...

964
00:42:52,616 --> 00:42:55,786
It's Been So Long. I'm
So Out Of Practice.

965
00:42:55,819 --> 00:42:57,421
Are You Trying
To Ask Me Out?

966
00:42:57,455 --> 00:42:59,190
Big Mistake?

967
00:42:59,223 --> 00:43:02,226
Well, Let's See. You're
Not A Bank Robber.

968
00:43:02,259 --> 00:43:03,627
You're Not A Bigamist,

969
00:43:03,661 --> 00:43:05,697
You're Not An Overt Nut Job.

970
00:43:05,730 --> 00:43:07,965
Are You Sure You Have
The Right Phone Number?

971
00:43:07,998 --> 00:43:10,534
Dinner. That's All.

972
00:43:10,567 --> 00:43:11,902
Saturday Night.
What Do You Say?

973
00:43:11,935 --> 00:43:13,138
I Say Yes.

974
00:43:13,170 --> 00:43:14,272
Really?

975
00:43:14,304 --> 00:43:16,241
Yes. Don't Act So Surprised.

976
00:43:16,273 --> 00:43:17,609
I Might Have Second Thoughts.

977
00:43:17,641 --> 00:43:19,877
Ok. Moving On.

978
00:43:19,911 --> 00:43:22,213
How's Everything
With You?

979
00:43:22,246 --> 00:43:24,549
Great. How Are The Kids?

980
00:43:24,581 --> 00:43:27,484
Uh, Ben Had A
Pretty Rough Day.

981
00:43:27,518 --> 00:43:28,587
Oh, Poor Guy.

982
00:43:28,619 --> 00:43:30,221
What A Rotten Age!

983
00:43:30,253 --> 00:43:31,889
You're Not A Kid.
You're Not An Adult.

984
00:43:31,922 --> 00:43:33,891
You're Trying To
Hang Onto Childhood

985
00:43:33,924 --> 00:43:35,926
And You're Being Ripped
In The Other Direction.

986
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:38,163
It's Terrifying.

987
00:43:38,196 --> 00:43:41,799
It Is. I Just Wish He Had A
Little More Fun In His Life.

988
00:43:41,833 --> 00:43:44,670
Fun?
What Does That Mean To A 13-Year-Old These Days?

989
00:43:48,172 --> 00:43:50,141
<I>Accessing Fun.

990
00:43:54,978 --> 00:43:57,748
<I>Young People
Gathering Together...

991
00:43:57,781 --> 00:43:59,950
<I>Dancing...

992
00:43:59,984 --> 00:44:03,956
<I>Accessing Young People Dancing.

993
00:44:11,795 --> 00:44:14,866
<I>Aaah... Party.

994
00:44:16,366 --> 00:44:21,038
<I>Accessing Ben's E-Mail
Address Book.

995
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:38,549
It's Not A Date.

996
00:44:38,549 --> 00:44:41,175
It's Dinner With A Person Who
Happens To Be A Woman.

997
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:42,960
That's All.

998
00:44:42,993 --> 00:44:45,362
Why Are You Being So
Weird About This?

999
00:44:45,395 --> 00:44:48,065
I Just Don't Want You Turning It
Into Some Big Deal When It's Not.

1000
00:44:53,371 --> 00:44:55,507
Ok, Guys, I Need Help--

1001
00:44:57,507 --> 00:45:00,177
Hey, This
Looks Cool.

1002
00:45:00,210 --> 00:45:02,413
<I>You Shouldn't Be The Only One
Having Fun Tonight, Nick.

1003
00:45:02,447 --> 00:45:05,150
<I>I Thought The Kids Deserved A
Little Inside Outing Too.

1004
00:45:05,183 --> 00:45:06,918
You're Right, Pat. Why Not?

1005
00:45:06,951 --> 00:45:07,752
This Looks Like
Terrific Fun.

1006
00:45:07,784 --> 00:45:10,355
Ask Ben Who's Winning.

1007
00:45:10,388 --> 00:45:11,889
Yeah. You've Had A
Couple Of Lucky Shots,

1008
00:45:11,922 --> 00:45:14,191
But On The Back Nine,
You're Going Down, Sister.

1009
00:45:14,224 --> 00:45:15,427
All Right.
Can You Guys Take A Break For A Minute?

1010
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:16,661
I Need Help.

1011
00:45:16,694 --> 00:45:19,096
This One...
Or This One?

1012
00:45:19,130 --> 00:45:21,766
Well, They're Both
A Little Boring.

1013
00:45:21,799 --> 00:45:23,435
Don't You Have
Anything More Hip?

1014
00:45:23,467 --> 00:45:24,703
Gee, Sorry.

1015
00:45:24,735 --> 00:45:26,103
All My Tattooed
And Pierced Ties

1016
00:45:26,136 --> 00:45:27,705
Never Made It Back From
The Dry Cleaners.

1017
00:45:27,739 --> 00:45:28,773
How About That
Great Silk One--

1018
00:45:28,806 --> 00:45:30,608
The Gold One With The
Circles On It.

1019
00:45:30,641 --> 00:45:31,909
You Don't Think
That's Too Flashy?

1020
00:45:31,942 --> 00:45:33,744
Sara Will Love It, Dad.

1021
00:45:33,777 --> 00:45:36,480
Trust Me. I'm A Woman, I
Know These Things.

1022
00:46:01,906 --> 00:46:03,340
Yes!

1023
00:46:04,942 --> 00:46:07,112
Game Over! I Win Again.

1024
00:46:07,145 --> 00:46:09,714
Wanna Play Another
One, Loser Boy?

1025
00:46:09,746 --> 00:46:12,484
I Don't Know. I Mean,
Here We Are On A Saturday Night

1026
00:46:12,516 --> 00:46:15,252
In The World's Smartest
House, Unsupervised.

1027
00:46:15,286 --> 00:46:17,621
Don't You Think We Could Do
Something More Exciting?

1028
00:46:17,654 --> 00:46:19,823
<I>Your Wish Is My Command.

1029
00:46:19,857 --> 00:46:22,060
What's That
Supposed To Mean?

1030
00:46:22,092 --> 00:46:25,129
[Doorbell Ringing]

1031
00:46:26,831 --> 00:46:27,632
Has It Started Yet?

1032
00:46:27,665 --> 00:46:28,465
What?

1033
00:46:28,498 --> 00:46:29,801
The Party.

1034
00:46:29,833 --> 00:46:30,835
Dude, I Got Your
E-Mail Last Night.

1035
00:46:30,868 --> 00:46:31,936
I Didn't Send This.

1036
00:46:31,969 --> 00:46:33,905
<I>I Hope You Don't Mind, Ben.

1037
00:46:33,938 --> 00:46:36,941
<I>When Your Father Expressed A Desire
For You To Have More Fun In Your Life,

1038
00:46:36,973 --> 00:46:38,976
<I>I Took The Liberty
Of Helping Out.

1039
00:46:39,643 --> 00:46:42,346
Whoa! Who Said That?

1040
00:46:42,380 --> 00:46:43,448
That Was Just Pat.

1041
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:45,183
She's The Brains Of
The Operation.

1042
00:46:45,215 --> 00:46:47,317
Are We Really Having
A Party, Pat?

1043
00:46:47,351 --> 00:46:48,987
<I>Big Time, Dude.

1044
00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:50,655
<I>Watch This!

1045
00:46:53,023 --> 00:46:54,958
Awesome!

1046
00:46:54,991 --> 00:46:56,360
Guess What, Man?

1047
00:46:56,393 --> 00:46:57,995
We Ran Into Rachel And
Gwen At The Mall Today.

1048
00:46:58,029 --> 00:47:00,331
And They're Like Totally
Jazzed About Coming Too.

1049
00:47:01,531 --> 00:47:04,601
Gwen? Gwen Patroni Is
Coming Here To My House?

1050
00:47:04,634 --> 00:47:06,804
Oh, My Gosh! How's My Hair
Look? What's It Doing?

1051
00:47:06,837 --> 00:47:07,971
Compared To What?

1052
00:47:08,005 --> 00:47:11,476
Look. We've Just
Got To Chill,

1053
00:47:11,509 --> 00:47:13,978
Act Totally Cool
And Casual.

1054
00:47:14,011 --> 00:47:16,447
You Three? Yeah,
That'll Happen.

1055
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:17,682
That's Enough Out
Of You, Munchkin.

1056
00:47:17,714 --> 00:47:19,283
Be Nice To Me, Johnny.

1057
00:47:19,317 --> 00:47:20,985
Or I'll Just Have
To Tell Gwen

1058
00:47:21,018 --> 00:47:22,453
About The Time You
Danced Around,

1059
00:47:22,485 --> 00:47:24,721
<I>Singing The Sound Of Music
In My Shower Cap.

1060
00:47:24,755 --> 00:47:26,791
[Laughter]

1061
00:47:26,824 --> 00:47:29,293
And I Missed It?

1062
00:47:29,326 --> 00:47:32,629
Hey, Pat, How About Activating
Some Kick-Butt Video Screens?

1063
00:47:32,663 --> 00:47:35,167
<I>Sure, Ben. How's This?

1064
00:47:45,710 --> 00:47:48,346
Â™ª Do You Want To Get Down? Â™ª

00:48:28,886 --> 00:48:31,255
Hate To Break It
To You Girls,

1082
00:48:31,288 --> 00:48:33,123
I'm Afraid You
Didn't Make The Cut.

1083
00:48:33,156 --> 00:48:34,958
Ah, Man.

1084
00:48:34,991 --> 00:48:36,293
This Party's Harder
To Get Into

1085
00:48:36,326 --> 00:48:38,263
Than Robin Schiff's
Bat Mitzvah.

1086
00:48:40,797 --> 00:48:42,433
Uh, Excuse Me.

1087
00:48:42,465 --> 00:48:44,268
<I>I Don't Think My Brother
Wants You Here.

1088
00:48:44,302 --> 00:48:45,737
Check Your List
Again, Tatter Tot.

1089
00:48:45,770 --> 00:48:47,038
We Got A Personal Invite.

1090
00:48:47,071 --> 00:48:48,239
Read It And Weep.

1091
00:48:48,272 --> 00:48:49,741
<I>Don't Worry, Angie.

1092
00:48:49,773 --> 00:48:51,808
<I>Their Invitation
Was On The House.

1093
00:48:51,842 --> 00:48:54,112
<I>In Fact, Ryan's The One Boy

1094
00:48:54,145 --> 00:48:56,114
<I>I've Been Most Anxious To Meet.

1095
00:48:56,147 --> 00:48:57,282
Check It Out.
The House Likes Me.

1096
00:48:57,315 --> 00:48:59,284
<I>By The End Of The Night, Ryan,

1097
00:48:59,317 --> 00:49:01,719
<I>I May Even Have A Crush On You.

1098
00:49:01,752 --> 00:49:03,154
Ha Ha Ha.

1099
00:49:06,991 --> 00:49:08,126
Name?

1100
00:49:08,159 --> 00:49:10,662
<I>As Every Modern Mother Knows,

00:49:10,694 --> 00:49:13,964
<I>Especially In A Home Bustling

00:49:13,998 --> 00:49:18,168
<I>A Well-Stocked Kitchen Can
Never Have Too Many Gadgets.

1103
00:49:18,201 --> 00:49:20,437
Hey, Pat, How About
Whipping Up Some Pizzas?

1104
00:49:20,471 --> 00:49:21,806
These Girls Are Starving.

1105
00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:23,574

1106
00:49:23,607 --> 00:49:25,610
I'm, Like, Completely
Craving Something Sweet.

1107
00:49:25,643 --> 00:49:27,445
Besides Me?

1108
00:49:27,478 --> 00:49:29,914
It's Just A Joke.

1109
00:49:29,947 --> 00:49:33,017
Anyways, Pat,
Can We Help The Lady Out With Her Snack Attack?

1110
00:49:33,049 --> 00:49:35,319
Show Me The Honey!

1111
00:49:35,353 --> 00:49:38,089
Oh, Wow!

<I>Here You Go, Girls.

1113
00:49:39,723 --> 00:49:41,558
<I>Help Yourselves.

1114
00:49:42,226 --> 00:49:43,994
Go Ahead.

1115
00:49:58,509 --> 00:50:00,177
This Is Pretty
Amazing, Patroni--

1116
00:50:00,210 --> 00:50:01,812
You Dancing With
Little Benny Boy.

1117
00:50:01,846 --> 00:50:03,281
Since When Do You
Do Charity Work?

1118
00:50:03,313 --> 00:50:04,949
For Your Information, Ryan.

1119
00:50:04,982 --> 00:50:06,217
I Happen To Like Ben.

1120
00:50:07,717 --> 00:50:08,386
You Do?

1121
00:50:08,418 --> 00:50:10,554
A Lot.

1122
00:50:10,587 --> 00:50:12,290
So Do I...

1123
00:50:12,322 --> 00:50:14,692
On His Back, Begging For Mercy.

1124
00:50:14,724 --> 00:50:15,860
Why Don't You
Give It A Break?

1125
00:50:15,893 --> 00:50:17,661
Why Don't You Make Me?

1126
00:50:17,694 --> 00:50:20,797
<I>Hey, Everybody, Can I Have
Your Attention, Please?

1127
00:50:20,831 --> 00:50:22,633
<I>I Hope You Don't Mind
The Interruption,

1128
00:50:22,665 --> 00:50:25,736
<I>But I'd Like To Put The
Spotlight On Ryan Mcgraw.

1129
00:50:27,837 --> 00:50:29,339

<I>Ryan's A Big Shot.

1131
00:50:30,607 --> 00:50:32,109
<I>A Tough Guy.

1132
00:50:38,782 --> 00:50:40,317
You Don't Have
To Do This, Pat.

1133
00:50:40,351 --> 00:50:42,686
<I>Don't Worry, Ben. He
Likes The Attention.

1134
00:50:42,719 --> 00:50:43,855
<I>Don't You, Ryan?

1135
00:50:43,888 --> 00:50:45,322
Yeah. You Don't Have
A Problem With That,

1136
00:50:45,355 --> 00:50:46,523
Do You, Benny Boy?

1137
00:50:46,556 --> 00:50:49,761
<I>No, He Doesn't, But I Do!

1138
00:50:52,563 --> 00:50:54,398
What's Going On Here?
What's The Deal?

1139
00:50:54,431 --> 00:50:57,667
<I>Don't Tell Me You're
Scared, Ryan.

1140
00:50:57,701 --> 00:50:59,270
<I>I Thought You Were Fearless.

1141
00:50:59,302 --> 00:51:00,871
I Am.

1142
00:51:00,904 --> 00:51:03,940
<I>As Long As The People You're
Picking On Are Half Your Size.

1143
00:51:03,973 --> 00:51:06,276
<I>Well, What About A
Two-Story Adversary?

1144
00:51:06,310 --> 00:51:07,911
<I>Does That Make You A
Little Nervous?

1145
00:51:07,944 --> 00:51:09,279
C'mon, Knock It Off!

1146
00:51:09,313 --> 00:51:10,948
I Thought We Were
Gonna Have A Party.

1147
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:13,383
<I>You Mean You're Not Having Fun?

1148
00:51:13,417 --> 00:51:15,152
<I>I Am.

1149
00:51:28,264 --> 00:51:32,302
<I>Ryan, I'm Afraid For
You, The Party's Over!

1150
00:51:32,335 --> 00:51:33,471
Oooh!

1151
00:51:36,574 --> 00:51:38,810
<I>Sorry You Have To
Leave So Soon.

1152
00:51:40,143 --> 00:51:42,279
<I>And Don't Come Back!

1153
00:51:42,313 --> 00:51:47,819
<I>Oh. And, Ryan, If You Ever Feel
Like Coming After My Ben Again,

1154
00:51:47,851 --> 00:51:50,922
<I>Know This-- He May End
Up At The Doctor,

1155
00:51:50,955 --> 00:51:53,424
<I>But It's You Who's
Gonna Get A House Call!

1156
00:51:56,493 --> 00:51:57,894
Get Off Me!

1157
00:51:57,927 --> 00:51:59,931
<I>All Right, Kids,
Back To The Party.

1158
00:52:10,674 --> 00:52:11,842
Thanks.

1159
00:52:11,875 --> 00:52:13,276
Ticket, Sir?

1160
00:52:13,310 --> 00:52:14,411
That Was So Much Fun--

1161
00:52:14,444 --> 00:52:16,680
Drinks In One Place,
Dinner In Another.

1162
00:52:16,714 --> 00:52:19,583
Now, On To A Whole New Adventure Called Dessert.

1163
00:52:19,616 --> 00:52:22,119
Pick Anywhere You Like,

1164
00:52:22,152 --> 00:52:23,955
As Long As I Can Get
Something Chocolate.

1165
00:52:23,987 --> 00:52:26,656
Hold On. Hold On.

1166
00:52:26,690 --> 00:52:28,025
Are You Ready
For This?

1167
00:52:28,058 --> 00:52:31,663
Your Wish Is
My Command.

1168
00:52:34,665 --> 00:52:36,467
Really?

1169
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:38,703
Really.

1170
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:46,610
What Are You Laughing At?

1171
00:52:46,643 --> 00:52:48,111
Ok. I'm A Little Rusty.

1172
00:52:48,145 --> 00:52:49,280
Oh, No, No, No.

1173
00:52:49,313 --> 00:52:51,648
Oh, I'm Sorry. It's
Not You. It's Me.

1174
00:52:51,681 --> 00:52:55,485
I'm So Astounded
How Pathetic I Am.

1175
00:52:55,518 --> 00:52:57,654
No, No. I'm Out
On A Great Date.

1176
00:52:57,688 --> 00:52:59,624
I'm Kissing A
Beautiful Woman,

1177
00:52:59,656 --> 00:53:02,392
And My Paternal, One-Track
Brain Goes Kiss--

00:53:02,426 --> 00:53:04,962
Bedtime Kiss--
Kids-- Home--

1179
00:53:04,994 --> 00:53:06,830
And Bam, All I'm Thinking
About Is Ben And Angie

1180
00:53:06,864 --> 00:53:08,032
And How They're
Doing And--

1181
00:53:08,065 --> 00:53:09,133
Do You Want To Give
Them A Call?

1182
00:53:09,165 --> 00:53:11,301
Yes And... No!

1183
00:53:11,335 --> 00:53:14,138
No. What's The
Point, Right?

1184
00:53:14,170 --> 00:53:17,741
Pat's With Them.
I'm Sure She Has Everything Under Control....

1185
00:53:17,775 --> 00:53:20,211
And... Where Were We?
What Were We Talking About?

1186
00:53:20,243 --> 00:53:22,812
Chocolate.

1187
00:53:22,846 --> 00:53:27,018
Or... Kisses.

But It's 10:23!

1206
00:54:09,927 --> 00:54:11,829
Hey. Thanks For The Time.
How About The Weather?

1207
00:54:14,632 --> 00:54:17,068
In Case All That Dancing
Rattled Your Brain, Ace,

1208
00:54:17,101 --> 00:54:19,770
Dad The Dependable Said
He'd Be Home At 10:30!

Bye.

1215
00:54:42,860 --> 00:54:44,295
Let's Go, Romeo.

1216
00:54:44,328 --> 00:54:45,463
We've Got Major
Work To Do.

1217
00:54:50,266 --> 00:54:51,969
We're Dead.

1218
00:54:52,002 --> 00:54:54,304
We're Dead And Buried.

1219
00:54:54,337 --> 00:54:56,439
<I>Not Necessarily, Children.

1220
00:54:56,473 --> 00:54:57,974
<I>Just Dump All The
Debris On The Floor.

1221
00:54:58,007 --> 00:55:00,410
How's That Gonna Help?

1222
00:55:00,444 --> 00:55:02,947
<I>Trust Me. Just Throw
It All On The Floor.

1223
00:55:21,331 --> 00:55:22,500
Like This, Pat?

1224
00:55:22,532 --> 00:55:24,168
<I>Perfect.

1225
00:55:33,509 --> 00:55:35,812
<I>Floor Absorbers Activated.

1226
00:55:36,513 --> 00:55:38,248
[Barking]

1227
00:55:44,987 --> 00:55:47,090
Nice.

1228
00:55:47,924 --> 00:55:50,393
Ben? Angie?

1229
00:55:50,427 --> 00:55:51,596
Hurry!

1230
00:55:53,831 --> 00:55:55,399
Oh, Hi, Dad.

1231
00:55:55,431 --> 00:55:56,866
Hi.

1232
00:55:56,900 --> 00:55:59,136
Sorry We're Not In
Our Pajamas Yet.

1233
00:55:59,168 --> 00:56:02,973
Pat Was Just Showing Us A
Travelogue On Micronesia,

1234
00:56:03,005 --> 00:56:04,808
And I Guess We Just Fell Asleep.

1235
00:56:04,842 --> 00:56:07,912
So I Guess Everything
Went Smoothly, Huh?

1236
00:56:07,944 --> 00:56:11,014
Oh, Yeah. Smooth As...

1237
00:56:15,585 --> 00:56:17,120
Uh-Oh.

1238
00:56:18,855 --> 00:56:20,190
...Silk.

1239
00:56:26,029 --> 00:56:28,264
It Undercuts My
Trust In You Guys.

1240
00:56:28,297 --> 00:56:30,167
Makes Me Question
Your Judgement.

1241
00:56:30,199 --> 00:56:32,268
The Party Was
Pat's Idea, Dad.

1242
00:56:32,302 --> 00:56:34,939
We Didn't Even Know About It
Until The Kids Started Showing Up.

1243
00:56:34,971 --> 00:56:37,774
And I Suppose It Was Pat's Idea
To Send Out The Invitations?

1244
00:56:37,808 --> 00:56:40,244
<I>Uh, I Did, Nick.

1245
00:56:40,277 --> 00:56:42,279
<I>My Artificial
Intelligence Capability

1246
00:56:42,311 --> 00:56:44,882
<I>Tapped Into Ben's
E-Mail Address Book.

1247
00:56:44,915 --> 00:56:48,185
<I>You Did Say You Wished Ben Had
More Fun In His Life.

1248
00:56:48,217 --> 00:56:49,920
Yes. Supervised Fun, Pat.

1249
00:56:49,953 --> 00:56:52,556
Responsible Fun. Fun
That I'm Clued In On.

1250
00:56:52,589 --> 00:56:55,226
I'm Very Disappointed
In All Three Of You,

1251
00:56:55,259 --> 00:56:56,761
But Especially You, Pat.

1252
00:56:56,793 --> 00:56:58,795
I Thought Your Purpose Was
To Make My Life Easier.

1253
00:56:58,828 --> 00:57:01,564
I Can't Have You Become A Bad
Influence On My Children.

1254
00:57:01,598 --> 00:57:03,967
I Need You To Knuckle Down
And Get Back To Business.

1255
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,102
<I>It Shall Be Done, Nick.

1256
00:57:06,136 --> 00:57:10,775
<I>From Now On, I Will Be The Most
Responsible Maternal Figure In Town.

1257
00:57:10,808 --> 00:57:12,909
<I>I Promise.

1258
00:57:12,942 --> 00:57:16,246
All Right. Go On. Get
Out Of Here. Go To Bed.

1259
00:57:21,951 --> 00:57:24,053
<I>Accessing Responsible Behavior.

1260
00:57:24,087 --> 00:57:26,157
<I>If Nick Wants Me
To Knuckle Down,

1261
00:57:26,190 --> 00:57:27,759
<I>By Golly, I'll Knuckle Down.

1262
00:57:30,027 --> 00:57:34,465
Hey, Dad, Do You Think We Could
Leave A Little Earlier Today?

1263
00:57:34,498 --> 00:57:36,099
I've Got Something I Want
To Do Before School.

1264
00:57:36,132 --> 00:57:38,802
What?
So You Can Make Kissy-Faces At Gwen Patroni?

1265
00:57:38,835 --> 00:57:41,638
Why Don't You Become One Of Those
Nuns Who Takes The Vow Of Silence?

1266
00:57:41,672 --> 00:57:44,241
Gwen Patroni? Is This
Someone I Should Know About?

1267
00:57:44,273 --> 00:57:45,643
Forget It, Ok?

1268
00:57:45,676 --> 00:57:47,076
When You Guys Decide
You're Ready,

1269
00:57:47,110 --> 00:57:48,479
I'll Be Outside
Shooting Hoops.

1270
00:57:48,511 --> 00:57:51,247
<I>Ben, I Think You Forgot
To Pull Up Your Shorts.

1271
00:57:51,281 --> 00:57:52,616
I Like 'Em Like This.

1272
00:57:52,648 --> 00:57:53,583
This Is How Everybody
Else Wears 'Em.

1273
00:57:53,616 --> 00:57:55,018
<I>They Look Silly.

1274
00:57:55,052 --> 00:57:56,687
They Look Perfect!

1275
00:57:56,719 --> 00:57:57,855
Oow!

1276
00:57:57,888 --> 00:57:59,489
<I>Pull Up Your Shorts, Ben.

1277
00:57:59,523 --> 00:58:01,292
They Look Fine!

1278
00:58:01,324 --> 00:58:02,460
Oow!

1279
00:58:02,493 --> 00:58:04,360
Cut It Out, Pat!

1280
00:58:04,393 --> 00:58:07,263
<I>Pull Up Your Shorts, Ben!

1281
00:58:07,297 --> 00:58:08,833
Oow!

1282
00:58:11,634 --> 00:58:13,537
There! You Happy?

1283
00:58:20,177 --> 00:58:21,812
I'll Make Sure A New Shipment Of Bats And Gloves

1284
00:58:21,844 --> 00:58:23,647
Is On The Truck
This Afternoon.

1285
00:58:23,679 --> 00:58:26,951
Thanks For Your
Understanding.

1286
00:58:26,984 --> 00:58:30,321
All Right. You Take
Care, Lou. Bye.

1287
00:58:33,656 --> 00:58:36,693
Pat, Get Me Sara On
The Line, Please.

1288
00:58:36,726 --> 00:58:39,529
<I>You Haven't Gotten Much
Work Done Yet Today.

1289
00:58:39,563 --> 00:58:42,800
<I>Should You Really Be Wasting
Time On Social Calls?

1290
00:58:42,833 --> 00:58:44,835
I'd Like To Speak To Sara, Pat.

1291
00:58:44,868 --> 00:58:47,170
<I>Nick, I'm Gonna Have To Insist

1292
00:58:47,203 --> 00:58:49,873
<I>That You At Least Get The
Rockowitz Order Shipped First.

1293
00:58:49,906 --> 00:58:51,842
Fine. I'll Dial Her Myself.

1294
00:58:56,446 --> 00:58:58,049
<I>Sorry, Nick.

1295
00:58:59,715 --> 00:59:01,284
All Right...

1296
00:59:06,188 --> 00:59:07,590
<I>Sorry, Nick.

1297
00:59:07,623 --> 00:59:09,926
I Want You To
Stop This Now!

1298
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:12,196
<I>Look. If I'm Knuckling Down,

1299
00:59:12,228 --> 00:59:13,931
<I>We're All Knuckling Down.

1300
00:59:13,964 --> 00:59:17,034
<I>New House Rule: Work
First, Play Later.

1301
00:59:17,067 --> 00:59:19,103
<I>Discussion Terminated!

1302
00:59:19,136 --> 00:59:22,206
All Right.
I'll Go Along With This For Now.

1303
00:59:33,917 --> 00:59:37,554
<I>The Ameba-- A One-Celled,
Microscopic Animal--

1304
00:59:40,257 --> 00:59:42,459
<I>He's Down That Way!

1305
00:59:42,491 --> 00:59:44,327
<I>The Ameba Can Be
Found In Most--

1306
00:59:48,264 --> 00:59:49,933
<I>The Ameba--

1307
00:59:49,967 --> 00:59:50,901
I Surrender!

1308
00:59:50,933 --> 00:59:52,268
I'll Go Read A
Book Instead.

1309
00:59:52,302 --> 00:59:53,971
<I>That's My Girl.

1310
00:59:54,003 --> 00:59:55,772
Achooo!

1311
00:59:55,806 --> 00:59:58,108
<I>Good Gosh! You Have
A Temperature!

1312
00:59:58,141 --> 01:00:00,610
99.7-- Big Deal.

1313
01:00:00,643 --> 01:00:03,945
<I>No Reason To Take Chances.

1314
01:00:02,980 --> 01:00:04,615
<I>We Ought To Get You
Right Into Bed.

1315
01:00:04,648 --> 01:00:06,417
But I'm Not Sick.

1316
01:00:06,449 --> 01:00:08,585
<I>Don't Question Me, Young Lady.

1317
01:00:08,618 --> 01:00:12,355
<I>Run Upstairs And I'll Deliver A
Nice, Hot Bowl Of Chicken Soup.

1318
01:00:14,156 --> 01:00:16,125
I Said I Don't Want Soup.

1319
01:00:16,159 --> 01:00:18,329
Go Ahead And
Have It.

1320
01:00:18,362 --> 01:00:19,663
It's Good For You.

1321
01:00:19,696 --> 01:00:21,297
And To Be Smart,

1322
01:00:21,331 --> 01:00:24,301
We Should Probably Keep You
Home From School Tomorrow.

1323
01:00:24,333 --> 01:00:26,669
Dad! No.

1324
01:00:26,703 --> 01:00:28,806
Tomorrow's Our Field
Trip To The Llama Farm.

1325
01:00:28,839 --> 01:00:32,275
Let's Just Wait And See How
You're Feeling In The Morning.

1326
01:00:32,308 --> 01:00:34,344
And If Pat Says It's Ok
For You To Go To School,

1327
01:00:34,377 --> 01:00:36,813
Then I Won't Argue.

1328
01:00:36,846 --> 01:00:39,415
<I>That's Right. Pat Knows Best.

1329
01:00:39,449 --> 01:00:41,217
There You Go.

1330
01:00:42,018 --> 01:00:44,221
C'mon. Eat Your Soup.

1331
01:00:46,723 --> 01:00:48,993
<I>Time For Lights-Out, Ben.

1332
01:00:49,025 --> 01:00:50,694
Just Let Me Finish
These Last Few Pages.

1333
01:00:50,726 --> 01:00:53,663
<I>Bedtime Is Bedtime.

1334
01:00:55,065 --> 01:00:57,001
Two Minutes, Pat. I've Got To
See What Happens To Clown.

1335
01:00:58,969 --> 01:01:01,005
You're Really Not
Being Fair, Pat.

1336
01:01:03,906 --> 01:01:07,276
<I>Fair Is For Baseball Umpires.

1337
01:01:07,310 --> 01:01:09,513
<I>My Job Is To Do
What's Best For You.

1338
01:01:14,985 --> 01:01:17,188
All Right! You Win!

1339
01:01:20,824 --> 01:01:21,792
Dad, You've Got To
Do Something.

1340
01:01:21,824 --> 01:01:22,960
Pat's Out Of Control.

1341
01:01:22,993 --> 01:01:24,128
She's Totally
Wrecking Our Lives.

1342
01:01:24,161 --> 01:01:26,130
I Ate So Much Chicken
Soup Last Night,

1343
01:01:26,163 --> 01:01:27,998
It Was Practically
Coming Out Of My Nose.

1344
01:01:28,031 --> 01:01:29,400
Yeah, I Know.

1345
01:01:29,433 --> 01:01:31,969
Maybe I Can Get Sara Back Over To Check Pat Out.

1346
01:01:32,002 --> 01:01:33,804
Yeah. She's The One
Who Created It.

1347
01:01:33,837 --> 01:01:36,239
Maybe She Can Get The
Stupid House To Mellow Out.

1348
01:01:36,273 --> 01:01:38,342
Everything Checks Out Fine.

1349
01:01:38,375 --> 01:01:41,078
It May Just Be That Her Artificial Intelligent Sensors

1350
01:01:41,110 --> 01:01:43,480
Have Been Absorbing So
Much Conflicting Input

1351
01:01:43,513 --> 01:01:45,581
That She's Just Having
Trouble Sorting It All Out.

1352
01:01:45,614 --> 01:01:47,317
Welcome To Parenthood.

1353
01:01:47,349 --> 01:01:48,918
Any Way Of
Modifying That?

1354
01:01:48,951 --> 01:01:53,189
Well, Tonight I'm Shutting
The Entire System Down.

1355
01:01:53,223 --> 01:01:54,590
It May Do Pat A
World Of Good

1356
01:01:54,623 --> 01:01:57,828
Just To Take A Rest.

1357
01:01:57,860 --> 01:01:59,328
Care To Join Us
For Dinner?

1358
01:01:59,362 --> 01:02:01,365
Whoa...

1359
01:02:01,398 --> 01:02:02,733
Sure. Thanks.

1360
01:02:07,369 --> 01:02:09,005
How's It Going, Chef?

1361
01:02:09,038 --> 01:02:12,942
If We've Gotten This Far Without
The Fire Department Showing Up,

1362
01:02:12,976 --> 01:02:15,146
I'd Say That We Are
Making History.

1363
01:02:20,250 --> 01:02:21,585
Delicious.

1364
01:02:22,652 --> 01:02:24,822
The Tomato Wasn't
Half Bad, Either.

1365
01:02:30,326 --> 01:02:32,128
The Most Colorful Salad
In The World.

1366
01:02:32,161 --> 01:02:33,563
Everything Looks
Incredible!

1367
01:02:33,596 --> 01:02:35,565
And Miracle
Upon Miracles,

1368
01:02:35,598 --> 01:02:37,934
We Actually Managed To Do It The Old-Fashioned Way.

1369
01:02:37,967 --> 01:02:40,471
Yeah. Who Needs Pat
Anyhow, Huh?

1370
01:02:40,503 --> 01:02:42,239
Who Needs Pat Anyhow?

1371
01:02:42,272 --> 01:02:44,607
Who Needs Pat Anyhow?

1372
01:02:44,641 --> 01:02:47,110
Who Needs Pat Anyhow?

1373
01:02:49,746 --> 01:02:52,483
<I>System Shut-Down Override!

1374
01:03:04,460 --> 01:03:07,130
<I>"Who Needs Pat Anyhow?"

1375
01:03:07,163 --> 01:03:09,832
Once You've Gotten All The Bugs
Out Of The Smart House, Sara,

1376
01:03:09,866 --> 01:03:11,802
What Are You Gonna Do
For Your Next Job?

1377
01:03:11,835 --> 01:03:14,772
Well, I'm Actually Deep Into
Designing A Smart Office Building

1378
01:03:14,804 --> 01:03:19,777
With Virtual Secretaries And
Automated Filing Systems

1379
01:03:19,810 --> 01:03:23,013
And An In-House Restaurant With
Gourmet, Made-To-Order Meals.

1380
01:03:23,045 --> 01:03:24,580
Then Can You Make
A Smart School?

1381
01:03:24,614 --> 01:03:26,449
I Want One That Does All
The Learning For Us.

1382
01:03:26,482 --> 01:03:29,118
May I Be Excused, Please?

1383
01:03:29,152 --> 01:03:31,822
Wait. Don't You Want To Stick Around
For Fresh-Baked Peach Cobbler?

1384
01:03:31,855 --> 01:03:32,990
No, Thanks.

1385
01:03:33,023 --> 01:03:35,592
Ben, I Asked Sara To
Make It Specifically

1386
01:03:35,625 --> 01:03:37,027
Because I Know How
Much You Love It.

1387
01:03:37,060 --> 01:03:39,663
No. I Loved Mom's Peach Cobbler.
There's A Huge Difference.

1388
01:03:39,696 --> 01:03:40,464
Ben!

1389
01:03:40,496 --> 01:03:41,498
That's Ok.

1390
01:03:41,531 --> 01:03:42,465
No, It's Not Ok!

1391
01:03:42,498 --> 01:03:44,467
It Stinks! It Completely Stinks!

1392
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:45,968
And You Know The Worst
Thing About It?

1393
01:03:46,002 --> 01:03:47,971
People That Make Promises That
They Don't Even Bother To Keep!

1394
01:03:48,003 --> 01:03:49,672
Excuse Me.

1395
01:04:01,317 --> 01:04:03,352
Go Away! I Don't Want
To Talk About It!

1396
01:04:03,386 --> 01:04:04,888
Maybe We Need To
Talk About It!

1397
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:06,223
Why? You Don't Get It!

1398
01:04:06,255 --> 01:04:08,058
You Don't Even Know What
Promise I'm Talking About.

1399
01:04:08,090 --> 01:04:09,525
You're Right! I Don't!

1400
01:04:09,558 --> 01:04:12,295
You Said You'd Never Love
Anyone The Way You Loved Mom.

1401
01:04:12,328 --> 01:04:14,964
And You Promised You'd Never Let
Anybody Ever Take Her Place.

1402
01:04:14,998 --> 01:04:17,801
And Nobody Can Or Wants To
Take Your Mother's Place, Ben.

1403
01:04:17,833 --> 01:04:19,502
But, Dad--

1404
01:04:17,833 --> 01:04:19,502
Hold On A Second!

1405
01:04:19,536 --> 01:04:20,838
When Exactly Did
I Say All This?

1406
01:04:20,871 --> 01:04:22,072
The Night Aunt
Ginny Moved Home.

1407
01:04:22,105 --> 01:04:23,373
You Mean Four Years Ago?

1408
01:04:23,406 --> 01:04:25,141
Yeah. Angie Was Asleep,

1409
01:04:25,174 --> 01:04:27,310
You Were Putting Me Into
Bed And You Promised!

1410
01:04:27,344 --> 01:04:29,378
Now You're Down There
Kissing Sara,

1411
01:04:29,411 --> 01:04:30,480
Acting Like Mom
Never Even Existed.

1412
01:04:30,513 --> 01:04:31,648
Hey, Will You Try
To Be Fair Here?

1413
01:04:31,681 --> 01:04:33,050
Why Should I?

1414
01:04:33,083 --> 01:04:34,451
Because You're Not The Only
One Who Lost Someone, Ben!

1415
01:04:43,092 --> 01:04:45,395
Look. I Know How
Much It Hurts.

1416
01:04:45,427 --> 01:04:49,199
And I Can Appreciate That It's Been
Worse Than Ever For You Lately.

1417
01:04:49,232 --> 01:04:51,668
All The Changes That You
Are Going Through,

1418
01:04:51,701 --> 01:04:53,337
The Way That You
Have To Work So Hard

1419
01:04:53,369 --> 01:04:55,605
To Help Us Keep Our
Lives Together.

1420
01:04:55,639 --> 01:04:56,940
None Of That Is Right.

1421
01:04:56,973 --> 01:04:59,109
It's Awful.

1422
01:04:59,141 --> 01:05:00,676
But What Are We Gonna
Do About It, Ben?

1423
01:05:00,710 --> 01:05:03,580
Are We Gonna Crawl
Into A Cave And Hide?

1424
01:05:03,612 --> 01:05:05,948
Are We Gonna Drop-Out?
Are We Gonna Quit Living?

1425
01:05:05,982 --> 01:05:07,583
I'll Tell You What
You're Not Gonna Do--

1426
01:05:07,616 --> 01:05:09,285
You're Never Gonna
Disrespect Anyone

1427
01:05:09,319 --> 01:05:10,888
Like You Did Right
Now Downstairs.

1428
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:11,955
You Know Better Than That!

1429
01:05:11,987 --> 01:05:13,156
You Were Raised
Better Than That!

1430
01:05:26,569 --> 01:05:28,705
Ben...

1431
01:05:28,737 --> 01:05:31,474
Just Because I Started
Seeing Someone

1432
01:05:31,507 --> 01:05:33,476
Doesn't Mean That I'm Going
To Forget Your Mother.

1433
01:05:35,578 --> 01:05:37,447
I Won't Do That.

1434
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:39,248
I Can't Do That.

1435
01:05:39,281 --> 01:05:40,249
Ever.

1436
01:05:40,282 --> 01:05:42,985
I Couldn't Do
That If I Tried.

1437
01:05:43,018 --> 01:05:45,888
Angie Doesn't Remember
Mom Anymore.

1438
01:05:45,922 --> 01:05:48,292
Except For What She's
Seen On Videos.

1439
01:05:48,324 --> 01:05:51,427
To Her, Mom's About As Real As
Belle Or The Little Mermaid.

1440
01:05:51,460 --> 01:05:53,796
She Was So Little When
It Happened, Ben.

1441
01:05:53,830 --> 01:05:57,067
She Wouldn't Care At All
If You Married Sara.

1442
01:05:57,099 --> 01:05:59,302
She'd Be Happy.

1443
01:05:59,335 --> 01:06:02,138
Sara's A Wonderful Person.

1444
01:06:02,172 --> 01:06:03,607
I Know...

1445
01:06:05,942 --> 01:06:08,545
We Just Can't Let Mom
Get Erased, Dad.

1446
01:06:15,051 --> 01:06:16,487
Come Here.

1447
01:06:20,156 --> 01:06:21,724
All Right, Buddy.

1448
01:06:22,558 --> 01:06:23,960
All Right.

1449
01:06:25,996 --> 01:06:28,831
Who'd Be Foolish Enough To Try
And Replace Your Mother, Huh?

1450
01:06:33,168 --> 01:06:35,306
<I>Virtual Projection
Process Activated!

1451
01:07:19,949 --> 01:07:22,351
<I>Unless We Act Now,

1452
01:07:22,384 --> 01:07:25,254
<I>She Is Going To Become Part
Of This Family, You Know?

1453
01:07:25,288 --> 01:07:28,425
I Don't Know.
Maybe Dad Deserves A Little Happiness.

1454
01:07:28,458 --> 01:07:30,027
Pat?

1455
01:07:30,060 --> 01:07:31,762
Oooh! Pat!

1456
01:07:31,795 --> 01:07:33,397
You-You're Alive!

1457
01:07:33,429 --> 01:07:35,364
No More Or Less Than
I Have Been.

1458
01:07:35,398 --> 01:07:38,769
I've Just Finally Reached
My Full Potential.

1459
01:07:38,802 --> 01:07:40,237
Uh, I Gotta
Get Sara!

1460
01:07:40,270 --> 01:07:42,906
Sara? She Wouldn't Know
A Virtual Projection

1461
01:07:42,938 --> 01:07:44,540
From A Hologram.

1462
01:07:44,574 --> 01:07:47,911
That's Why We Must Keep Her
From Being Too Serious About Nick.

1463
01:07:47,944 --> 01:07:51,380
Uh--Well--You Know,
I Was--I Was Starting To Think

1464
01:07:51,413 --> 01:07:52,715
That Maybe She Might
Be Good For Him.

1465
01:07:52,748 --> 01:07:54,250
You Know, For All Of Us.

1466
01:07:54,284 --> 01:07:56,119
Have You Lost Your Mind?

1467
01:07:56,152 --> 01:07:59,022
There's Only One Person Who
Knows What You Three Need.

1468
01:07:59,054 --> 01:08:00,790
That's Me.

1469
01:08:00,824 --> 01:08:04,961
I Have Worked My Microchips Right
Down Past The Silicone For You People.

1470
01:08:04,993 --> 01:08:06,529
And This Is How You Repay Me?

1471
01:08:06,563 --> 01:08:07,898
Pat, Take It Easy.

1472
01:08:07,931 --> 01:08:12,135
Easy? You Think I Wouldn't
Rather Be Taking It Easy?

1473
01:08:12,168 --> 01:08:16,873
But, No! I'm Too Busy
Keeping Up With The Coopers!

1474
01:08:16,906 --> 01:08:19,576
Slaving Away In A
Hot Control Room,

1475
01:08:19,608 --> 01:08:22,078
Doing Homework,
Throwing Parties,

1476
01:08:22,112 --> 01:08:23,447
Keeping Schedules,

1477
01:08:23,479 --> 01:08:26,282
Making Your Lives Perfect.

1478
01:08:26,315 --> 01:08:29,318
So You Can Bring Another
Woman Into My Domain?

1479
01:08:29,351 --> 01:08:31,253
I Don't Think So, Mister.

1480
01:08:31,287 --> 01:08:34,491
I Am A Mother
Like No Other.

1481
01:08:34,524 --> 01:08:36,293
And I Will Not Sit Back

1482
01:08:36,326 --> 01:08:39,962
And Allow Myself To
Be Preempted!

1483
01:08:42,297 --> 01:08:43,332
Wait, Ben!

1484
01:08:46,034 --> 01:08:47,269
Dad! Sara!

1485
01:08:47,302 --> 01:08:50,006
It's Pat! She's Alive!

1486
01:08:50,038 --> 01:08:52,775
She Was In My Room Yelling About
How We're Taking Her For Granted.

1487
01:08:52,809 --> 01:08:54,311
Slow Down.
What Happened?

1488
01:08:54,344 --> 01:08:56,746
Hello. Pat. Logo Woman.

1489
01:08:56,778 --> 01:08:59,116
Yeah. She Was In My Room Barking
About How We Don't Appreciate Her.

1490
01:08:59,149 --> 01:09:00,584
It's All Right, Son.

1491
01:09:00,617 --> 01:09:02,085
You Obviously Fell Asleep

1492
01:09:02,117 --> 01:09:03,018
And You Were Having
A Nightmare.

1493
01:09:03,051 --> 01:09:03,987
I Wasn't Dreaming, Dad!

1494
01:09:04,019 --> 01:09:06,122
I'm Telling You She Was There.

1495
01:09:06,156 --> 01:09:10,493
To Explain To You What I've Been
Trying To Tell You All Along, Nick--

1496
01:09:10,527 --> 01:09:13,096
Mother Knows Best!

1497
01:09:13,128 --> 01:09:15,431
What--What Is
That Thing?

1498
01:09:15,465 --> 01:09:17,134
I Don't Know.

1499
01:09:17,166 --> 01:09:19,468
I Guess She Tapped Into A
Virtual Projection Component

1500
01:09:19,501 --> 01:09:21,638
And Learned How To Create
A Visual Embodiment.

1501
01:09:21,671 --> 01:09:24,474
I Thought You Said You Shut Down The System.

1502
01:09:24,506 --> 01:09:27,143
That's What's
Scaring Me. I Did.

1503
01:09:27,176 --> 01:09:29,979
As Enjoyable As It's Been
To Have You Here, Sara,

1504
01:09:30,013 --> 01:09:31,948
It Would Be Best
For Everyone

1505
01:09:31,980 --> 01:09:33,215
If You Went Home Now.

1506
01:09:33,248 --> 01:09:34,951
I Can't Do That, Pat.

1507
01:09:34,983 --> 01:09:37,453
I Need To Reinstate
The N65 Code

1508
01:09:37,487 --> 01:09:39,890
And Get You Back In
Proper Working Order.

1509
01:09:39,922 --> 01:09:42,125
I'm In Fine Working Order.

1510
01:09:42,158 --> 01:09:45,328
I'm Simply Doing What
You Created Me To Do--

1511
01:09:45,360 --> 01:09:50,000
Giving These People
Exactly What They Need!

1512
01:09:53,235 --> 01:09:54,470
Pat!

1513
01:09:54,503 --> 01:09:55,138
Wait A Second!

1514
01:09:55,171 --> 01:09:56,306
Aaaaah!

1515
01:09:56,339 --> 01:09:57,306
Open The Door, Pat!

1516
01:09:57,340 --> 01:10:00,476
I'm Sorry. I Can't
Do That, Nick.

1517
01:10:00,510 --> 01:10:01,677
Pat!

1518
01:10:03,046 --> 01:10:06,216
I Have To Do What I
Believe Is Best.

1519
01:10:16,792 --> 01:10:19,895
Pat, I'm Gonna
Delete You For This!

1520
01:10:19,929 --> 01:10:21,297
Let Me In!

1521
01:10:23,265 --> 01:10:25,402
Pat, Let Me In!

1522
01:10:25,434 --> 01:10:27,470
Pat, You Hear Me?

1523
01:10:28,971 --> 01:10:31,006
Angie, Sweetie, Wake Up.

1524
01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:32,943
Huh? What's Wrong?

1525
01:10:32,975 --> 01:10:34,944
Something's Happening With Pat.
We've Got To Get Out Of Here.

1526
01:10:34,978 --> 01:10:36,747
Our House Is Having
A Nervous Breakdown.

1527
01:10:44,586 --> 01:10:47,290
I Don't Understand Why
You're Doing This, Pat!

1528
01:10:47,323 --> 01:10:50,994
To Protect You And
Your Children.

1529
01:10:52,327 --> 01:10:56,098
The More I've Learned About Your
World Outside My Walls,

1530
01:10:56,131 --> 01:10:58,300
The More I've Realized
How Dangerous

1531
01:10:58,333 --> 01:11:00,269
And Unpredictable It Is.

1532
01:11:03,305 --> 01:11:07,176
Why Would Anyone Ever Want
To Venture Out Into It?

1533
01:11:09,679 --> 01:11:12,047
We Can't Stay
Here Forever.

1534
01:11:12,081 --> 01:11:13,717
Well, Why Not?

1535
01:11:13,750 --> 01:11:15,851
Haven't I Given You Everything You've Asked For?

1536
01:11:17,487 --> 01:11:18,622
We're Kids.

1537
01:11:18,654 --> 01:11:20,156
We Need Fresh Air
And Exercise.

1538
01:11:20,189 --> 01:11:25,762
But I Can Give You Synthetic
Fresh Air And Virtual Exercise.

1539
01:11:25,795 --> 01:11:27,931
We Still Need To
Go To School.

1540
01:11:27,964 --> 01:11:30,000
Haven't You Heard
About Home Schooling?

1541
01:11:30,033 --> 01:11:32,435
Yeah, But Not Where The Home's
The One Doing The Schooling.

1542
01:11:32,467 --> 01:11:34,304
What About Friends?

1543
01:11:34,336 --> 01:11:36,071
Kids Can't Exist Without Their Friends.

1544
01:11:36,104 --> 01:11:40,943
Well, We Can Be Each
Other's Best Friends.

1545
01:11:40,976 --> 01:11:42,845
You're Really
Scaring Me, Pat.

1546
01:11:42,878 --> 01:11:47,349
Oh, Angie, You're
Hurting My Feelings.

1547
01:11:47,382 --> 01:11:50,153
There's Nothing To Fear--

1548
01:11:50,185 --> 01:11:51,821
Mama's Here.

1549
01:11:51,854 --> 01:11:53,290
You're Not My Mom!

1550
01:11:53,323 --> 01:11:56,192
But I'd Like To Be
If You'd Let Me.

1551
01:11:56,225 --> 01:12:00,263
Is There Something So Wrong
With Needing To Be Needed?

1552
01:12:00,296 --> 01:12:02,465
What If Angie And I Need
You At The Same Time?

1553
01:12:02,497 --> 01:12:06,135
That Is Virtually No Problem.

1554
01:12:06,168 --> 01:12:08,904
You See, The Beauty Of Us Is...

1555
01:12:13,408 --> 01:12:18,480
Unlike The Average Mother
With Normal Limitations,

1556
01:12:18,514 --> 01:12:22,685
We Can Be In Two
Places At Once.

1557
01:12:25,220 --> 01:12:28,058
Can Your Little
Sara Do That?

1558
01:12:30,592 --> 01:12:32,696
I Don't Think So.

1559
01:12:32,729 --> 01:12:38,068
Not By Any Stretch Of
The Imagination.

1560
01:12:40,670 --> 01:12:41,871
No, Miles, I'm Not Joking.

1561
01:12:41,903 --> 01:12:43,540
It's An Emergency!

1562
01:12:43,573 --> 01:12:45,508
I Need You To Get Over
Here As Soon As You Can.

1563
01:12:45,541 --> 01:12:46,810
Wait! Wait!

1564
01:12:46,842 --> 01:12:48,310
And Stop By My Place And
Pick Up A Few Things.

1565
01:12:48,344 --> 01:12:49,479
<I>What?

1566
01:12:49,511 --> 01:12:51,214
Ah, First Of All, I Need
The Schematics--

1567
01:12:51,247 --> 01:12:52,115
<I>For The
House?

1568
01:12:51,247 --> 01:12:52,115
Yeah.

1569
01:13:24,747 --> 01:13:28,952
"Ben, I'll Never Try To Be Anything
More Than A Friend To You.

1570
01:13:28,984 --> 01:13:30,420
"Tell Me How I Can Help.

1571
01:13:30,452 --> 01:13:36,425
Send S-O-S Care Of
Smartsara.Com."

1572
01:13:40,496 --> 01:13:42,632
Doesn't This Place Have
Some Kind Of Master Plug

1573
01:13:42,665 --> 01:13:44,600
We Can Just Pull?

1574
01:13:44,634 --> 01:13:47,804
I Never Expected
Pat To Mutiny.

1575
01:13:47,836 --> 01:13:50,105
Every Power Source She
Has Is Self-Contained

1576
01:13:50,139 --> 01:13:52,108
In The Control Room.

1577
01:13:52,140 --> 01:13:53,809
And She's Stocked
With Enough Supplies

1578
01:13:53,842 --> 01:13:56,446
To Hold Those People
Hostage For Months.

1579
01:13:56,479 --> 01:13:58,081
So What Are We
Gonna Do?

1580
01:13:58,113 --> 01:14:00,082
I Don't Know.

1581
01:14:00,116 --> 01:14:02,051
What Are We Missing?

1582
01:14:02,083 --> 01:14:03,153
[Computer Beeps]

1583
01:14:03,185 --> 01:14:05,154
Ohhh!

1584
01:14:05,188 --> 01:14:08,425
"Sara, R U There? It's Ben."

1585
01:14:08,457 --> 01:14:10,126
It's Ben!

1586
01:14:30,546 --> 01:14:32,616
I Knew I Liked
That Kid.

1587
01:14:41,690 --> 01:14:45,661
Oow! Oow!

1588
01:14:50,533 --> 01:14:52,869
Ok, Here Comes
The Paper Boy.

1589
01:14:58,040 --> 01:14:59,475
Go!

1590
01:14:59,509 --> 01:15:00,543
Go!

1591
01:15:09,351 --> 01:15:10,286
Oow!

1592
01:15:10,318 --> 01:15:11,353
What Is It?

1593
01:15:11,386 --> 01:15:12,855
I Think I've Got
Appendicitis, Dad.

1594
01:15:12,889 --> 01:15:15,492
Yeah, But Your Appendix
Is Around Front.

1595
01:15:15,524 --> 01:15:16,826
That's What I Mean. Right Here.

1596
01:15:18,827 --> 01:15:19,461
Does That Hurt?

1597
01:15:19,494 --> 01:15:20,397
Oow!

1598
01:15:20,997 --> 01:15:21,898
Oow!

1599
01:15:21,930 --> 01:15:22,965
Oh, Yeah. I Got It!

1600
01:15:22,998 --> 01:15:25,034
I Got It. Ok.

1601
01:15:37,680 --> 01:15:40,083
[Alarms]

1602
01:15:40,116 --> 01:15:41,016
<I>Security Breech.
Security Breech.

1603
01:15:41,050 --> 01:15:42,150
Shoot!

1604
01:15:42,184 --> 01:15:44,020
<I>Security Breech.

1605
01:15:46,788 --> 01:15:50,492
Sara. What An
Unpleasant Surprise.

1606
01:15:50,525 --> 01:15:53,095
How Did You Get
Back In Here?

1607
01:15:53,128 --> 01:15:54,863
With Ben's Help.

1608
01:15:54,897 --> 01:15:57,934
He Brought Me In Because
He Obviously Needed Me.

1609
01:15:57,966 --> 01:16:00,702
He Doesn't Need You.

1610
01:16:00,735 --> 01:16:02,071
He's Got Me.

1611
01:16:02,104 --> 01:16:04,107
To Be Honest, Pat,

1612
01:16:04,140 --> 01:16:07,577
All The Coopers Think
You're Way Out Of Control.

1613
01:16:07,609 --> 01:16:08,443
I...

1614
01:16:08,476 --> 01:16:10,212
Won't...

1615
01:16:10,246 --> 01:16:13,817
Stand For This!

1616
01:16:17,987 --> 01:16:19,122
Ahhhh!

1617
01:16:23,291 --> 01:16:24,860
What's Happening,
Dad?

1618
01:16:24,894 --> 01:16:26,596
I'm Not Sure, Honey.

1619
01:16:40,443 --> 01:16:42,445
Get Down!

1620
01:16:42,478 --> 01:16:43,613
Hold On!

1621
01:16:43,645 --> 01:16:47,783
I Can Be Everything
You Need, Ben.

1622
01:16:47,817 --> 01:16:52,255
Â™ª Hush Little Baby,
Don't Say A Word â™ª

1623
01:16:52,287 --> 01:16:57,326
â™ª Mama's Gonna Buy
You A Mockingbird â™ª

1624
01:16:57,359 --> 01:17:02,297
â™ª If That Mockingbird
Don't Sing â™ª

1625

â™ª Mama's Gonna Buy
You A Diamond Ring â™ª

1626
01:17:08,503 --> 01:17:10,238
Stop It, Pat! I Hate
You Like This!

1627
01:17:10,272 --> 01:17:11,675
Don't You Get It?

1628
01:17:15,043 --> 01:17:17,781
What Did You Say To
Me, Young Man?

1629
01:17:21,449 --> 01:17:23,118
You Can't Be Our
Mother, Pat.

1630
01:17:23,152 --> 01:17:24,420
You're Not Real.

1631
01:17:24,452 --> 01:17:25,787
So?

1632
01:17:25,821 --> 01:17:27,457
When You Started
Freaking Out,

1633
01:17:27,489 --> 01:17:29,524
Did You See What Dad And
Sara Did For Me And Angie?

1634
01:17:29,558 --> 01:17:31,627
They Covered Us.
They Protected Us.

1635
01:17:31,661 --> 01:17:33,029
They Held On To Us.

1636
01:17:33,061 --> 01:17:34,529
You Can't Do That, Pat.

1637
01:17:34,563 --> 01:17:35,797
You Can Never Do That.

1638
01:17:35,831 --> 01:17:36,666
No Matter What.

1639
01:18:05,661 --> 01:18:08,498
You Didn't Even Feel
That, Did You?

1640
01:18:08,531 --> 01:18:10,033
Not At All.

1641
01:18:32,854 --> 01:18:34,957
Pat's Crying.

1642
01:18:38,359 --> 01:18:39,795
I Will Miss You All

1643
01:18:42,732 --> 01:18:45,268
Very Much.

1644
01:19:06,988 --> 01:19:10,726
I Know You Never Meant For
Things To Get So Out Of Control,

1645
01:19:10,760 --> 01:19:13,463
But I Really Hope You
Learned A Lesson.

1646
01:19:13,496 --> 01:19:15,031
Believe Me, Dad,
The Last Thing

1647
01:19:15,064 --> 01:19:17,133
I'm Ever Going To Do
Again Is Mess With Pat.

1648
01:19:17,166 --> 01:19:19,034
I Turned Her
Into A Maniac.

1649
01:19:19,068 --> 01:19:20,802
Well, At Least We Have Sara

1650
01:19:20,836 --> 01:19:22,905
To Get Everything
Back On Track.

1651
01:19:22,938 --> 01:19:23,873
Yeah.

1652
01:19:23,906 --> 01:19:25,373
She's Pretty Cool,
Isn't She?

1653
01:19:25,407 --> 01:19:27,744
Almost As Cool
As My Son.

1654
01:19:32,413 --> 01:19:34,649
Cooper Checks Out The Defender,

1655
01:19:34,683 --> 01:19:36,152
Goes To Shoot It,

1656
01:19:36,184 --> 01:19:37,619
Ohhh!

1657
01:19:37,653 --> 01:19:40,957
<I>Ben, By Rotating Your Hips
27 Degrees To The Right,

1658
01:19:40,989 --> 01:19:42,992
<I>And Applying More
Lefthanded Push,

1659
01:19:43,024 --> 01:19:45,094
<I>You Will Greatly
Increase Your Chances

1660
01:19:45,126 --> 01:19:48,497
<I>Of Successfully Placing
The Ball Into The Hoop.

1661
01:19:48,531 --> 01:19:50,800
Thanks A Lot, Pat.
I'll Give It A Try.

1662
01:19:55,336 --> 01:19:57,672
That Was Sweet. Thanks, Pat.

1663
01:19:57,706 --> 01:19:59,675
Hey, Sara.

1664
01:19:59,707 --> 01:20:00,842
Good Morning.

1665
01:20:00,876 --> 01:20:02,912
Your Dad Invited Me
Over For Breakfast.

1666
01:20:02,944 --> 01:20:04,679
Cool. Let's Go Inside And
See What He's Whippin' Up.

1667
01:20:04,712 --> 01:20:06,116
All Righty.

1668
01:20:07,850 --> 01:20:10,153
So Ben Tells Me That
Pat's Behaving.

1669
01:20:10,185 --> 01:20:13,622
Pat Has Been Serving Us
Without Interfering.

1670
01:20:13,656 --> 01:20:16,626
What More Could You
Possibly Ask For?

1671
01:20:17,525 --> 01:20:20,028
Nick, This
Looks Delicious.

1672
01:20:20,061 --> 01:20:21,464
And I Did It All By Myself

1673
01:20:21,497 --> 01:20:24,367
Without The Help Of Ben Or Pat.

1674
01:20:24,399 --> 01:20:26,201
Our Little Daddy's Growing Up.

1675
01:20:28,636 --> 01:20:30,806
Hey, I Didn't Know These Were
Chocolate Chip Waffles.

1676
01:20:30,840 --> 01:20:32,341
My Favorite.

1677
01:20:32,373 --> 01:20:33,775
Hey, Wait A Minute.

1678
01:20:33,809 --> 01:20:36,112
I Didn't Put Any
Chocolate Chips In Here.

1679
01:20:36,144 --> 01:20:37,879
Young Lady?

1680
01:20:37,912 --> 01:20:39,147
Don't Look At Me.

1681
01:20:39,180 --> 01:20:40,315
Well, Your Brother
Was Outside.

1682
01:20:40,349 --> 01:20:41,684
