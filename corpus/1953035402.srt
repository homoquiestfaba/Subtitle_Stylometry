1
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:32,498
Do you want to hear
a romantic story?

2
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:35,467
It was World War II.

3
00:00:35,502 --> 00:00:38,801
He was young, 22, 23,

4
00:00:38,838 --> 00:00:42,968
paratrooper,
tough son of a bitch.

5
00:00:43,009 --> 00:00:45,807
They were being dropped
somewhere over France.

6
00:00:51,084 --> 00:00:53,814
His chute was damaged
by enemy fire,

7
00:00:53,853 --> 00:00:57,118
and he lost control

8
00:00:57,157 --> 00:01:01,025
and landed on the roof of a house
in the middle of the country.

9
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:05,691
I guess he got injured somehow,

10
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:08,826
I think from the hard landing
from the hole in his chute.

11
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:13,939
Anyway, the man
that lived in the house

12
00:01:13,973 --> 00:01:19,570
had a beautiful young daughter
who nursed him back to health.

13
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:25,373
And after a few days,
he left to rejoin his unit,

14
00:01:26,953 --> 00:01:31,720
but not before telling her
that he would be back for her.

15
00:01:38,865 --> 00:01:42,062
Eight months later,
he returned...

16
00:01:44,571 --> 00:01:47,904
and he's been with
my grandmother ever since.

17
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,311
Beautiful story, huh?

18
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:58,743
Romantic, right?

19
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:01,253
Yeah, romantic.

20
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:11,593
He said that he would be here.

21
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:13,895
L... I told him this morning.

22
00:02:13,933 --> 00:02:17,460
Well, why don't you give him
a call again?

23
00:02:17,504 --> 00:02:19,472
I'll handle another patient,

24
00:02:19,506 --> 00:02:22,168
and I'm sure he'll be here
when I come back.

25
00:02:37,957 --> 00:02:41,358
Oh, my God!
You're unfucking believable.

26
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:44,029
I'm gonna come so fucking hard.

27
00:02:53,206 --> 00:02:54,969
Oh, God!

28
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,475
Fuck!

29
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:57,840
Oh, my God, yeah!

30
00:02:57,877 --> 00:02:59,003
Don't... Don't... Don't...

31
00:02:59,045 --> 00:03:00,012
Don't swallow it.

32
00:03:00,046 --> 00:03:01,479
Hmm?
Don't swallow it.

33
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:04,210
No, don't...
don't spit it out.

34
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:13,651
Spit it in here, baby.

35
00:03:20,733 --> 00:03:22,530
You turn me on.

36
00:03:27,473 --> 00:03:28,303
I gotta go.

37
00:03:42,188 --> 00:03:45,385
Early this morning, local volunteers
gathered to work with police

38
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:48,087
in combing a huge area
down by the shipyards

39
00:03:48,127 --> 00:03:50,118
for any signs of
10-year-old Ohristie Dillon.

40
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:51,530
But later in the day,

41
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:52,861
police once again
found themselves

42
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:56,357
reaching out to the public
for help in this unsettling case.

43
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:59,530
We believe the perpetrator snuck
into the bedroom window

44
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:01,301
and took her while
the family was asleep.

45
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:02,603
Detective,
one more question, please.

46
00:04:02,642 --> 00:04:06,408
You've been questioning a neighbor
by the name of Roger Beckworth.

47
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:07,811
Is he a suspect?

48
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,014
No.

49
00:04:25,064 --> 00:04:28,363
I already told you Mr. Beckworth
is merely a person of interest.

50
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:30,096
Now, that's all I have for you today.

51
00:04:30,136 --> 00:04:32,764
All I ask is that if anybody
sees Ohristie Dillon

52
00:04:32,805 --> 00:04:34,295
or knows anything
about her whereabouts,

53
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:37,104
to please contact 911
so we can get her back here

54
00:04:37,143 --> 00:04:39,202
where she belongs,
at home with her family.

55
00:04:39,512 --> 00:04:40,444
Thank you.

56
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,040
Detective, I just need to know...
is there any other suspect?

57
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:47,616
Frankie...

58
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:51,685
so you still want to keep two black-and-whites
in front of the house?

59
00:04:51,724 --> 00:04:53,954
Yeah, and, uh...

60
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:57,927
keep the reporters
off the damn lawn, okay?

61
00:04:58,231 --> 00:04:59,323
Right. Right.

62
00:05:00,566 --> 00:05:03,057
All right, Barbara Walters,
that's enough.

63
00:05:03,102 --> 00:05:05,434
Let's go. Off the lawn.

64
00:05:16,849 --> 00:05:18,544
I got here as soon as I could.

65
00:05:18,584 --> 00:05:19,551
I'm so sorry.

66
00:05:19,585 --> 00:05:20,950
I got caught up with a new client.

67
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:22,477
I called your cell phone.

68
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:24,490
I know. The battery's dead.

69
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:26,549
I forgot to charge it.

70
00:05:26,592 --> 00:05:27,923
Why are you crying?

71
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,895
You're 40 minutes late, Ryan!

72
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:34,058
I know. L... I got stuck with a client. L...

73
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,727
I told you I'm sorry,

74
00:05:35,768 --> 00:05:38,293
but I'm here now,
a-and we're here now.

75
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,240
You did it already?

76
00:05:43,309 --> 00:05:45,106
In the car.
In the parking lot.

77
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:48,780
In the parking lot?

78
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:50,308
Yeah.

79
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,942
You know I get nervous
in doctors' offices.

80
00:05:51,984 --> 00:05:55,010
I just wanted to make sure
that I had a good sample.

81
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:07,499
Ah, Ryan, you made it.

82
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:08,557
Yes.

83
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:11,532
- And I see you have your sample already.
- I do.

84
00:06:12,138 --> 00:06:13,765
Well, let's get started.

85
00:06:38,664 --> 00:06:40,063
We're praying for you.

86
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,261
Thank you.

87
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:08,416
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm good.

88
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:11,430
Good.

89
00:07:11,464 --> 00:07:14,297
Well, that's good.

90
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:17,893
Still getting your weekly tests, right?

91
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:22,834
Good, 'cause your parents
aren't backing down.

92
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:24,334
They want him,

93
00:07:24,377 --> 00:07:26,311
and they're gonna say that you're
not fit to care for him.

94
00:07:26,345 --> 00:07:27,403
They want him in a home.

95
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:28,778
He doesn't want to go there.

96
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:30,749
Well, we've done
everything that we can

97
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:33,047
to establish that you're
a responsible caregiver,

98
00:07:33,085 --> 00:07:37,112
so who... uh, who's
assigned to us for this?

99
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,554
Michael Ambrose.

100
00:07:40,593 --> 00:07:41,753
He's fair.

101
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:43,557
He's gonna listen to us,

102
00:07:43,596 --> 00:07:45,723
and that's really all that you
can ask for in a mediator.

103
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:51,401
I know it sounds really cold.
Are you okay?

104
00:07:54,674 --> 00:07:56,039
Yeah.

105
00:07:59,846 --> 00:08:02,212
Why don't I come over to your place
the night before?

106
00:08:02,248 --> 00:08:03,579
We'll prepare.

107
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:06,478
Okay.

108
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:13,222
I hate...

109
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:15,955
being obligated to talk to people

110
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:18,020
just because it's polite.

111
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,862
I hate...

112
00:08:23,903 --> 00:08:26,201
people who say
that money doesn't matter,

113
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:28,730
because it does.

114
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,801
I hate laugh tracks.

115
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:37,111
I hate people who don't think
that there are two Americas.

116
00:08:40,453 --> 00:08:45,083
I hate when you bite into an onion ring
and the onion comes out,

117
00:08:45,124 --> 00:08:49,458
but then you're left with
this fried bread tube thing.

118
00:08:49,495 --> 00:08:53,659
I hate how I always think that I have
a booger hanging out of my nose,

119
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:57,635
and I'm constantly trying
not to touch my nose so that...

120
00:08:58,471 --> 00:09:00,564
I just... I always feel like
there's a booger that's there,

121
00:09:00,606 --> 00:09:03,541
that's dangling there
when I'm talking to people, and...

122
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:05,407
I hate it.

123
00:09:05,444 --> 00:09:08,971
I hate people who don't use pictures
of themselves on Facebook.

124
00:09:14,487 --> 00:09:15,419
MIX

125
00:09:15,454 --> 00:09:19,117
DID YOU LOSE THIS DOG?

126
00:09:49,455 --> 00:09:50,717
Uh, sorry. I, um...

127
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:53,156
I think I hit something over here!

128
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:03,262
...Found her bed empty

129
00:10:03,302 --> 00:10:04,997
and the screen
on her window removed.

130
00:10:05,037 --> 00:10:06,629
Right now, neither of her parents

131
00:10:06,672 --> 00:10:08,367
are considered suspects
by the authorities,

132
00:10:08,407 --> 00:10:11,205
but there is some interest
being paid to a neighbor.

133
00:10:11,243 --> 00:10:12,232
Thanks, Leslie.

134
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:14,803
Prepare for the heat wave to contin...

135
00:10:14,847 --> 00:10:16,508
Ready to go, buddy?

136
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:48,940
One of us has gotta lose some weight.

137
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:13,264
And Paris Hilton.
I fucking hate that bitch.

138
00:11:13,305 --> 00:11:17,036
And... And hairy moles
on people's faces.

139
00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:19,271
You know, I just want
to grab that catfish whisker

140
00:11:19,311 --> 00:11:21,871
and just rip it
right off of their chin.

141
00:11:21,914 --> 00:11:22,881
Jesus Ohrist.

142
00:11:22,915 --> 00:11:24,815
And rotator cuffs.

143
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:25,976
I hate them.

144
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:29,749
I tore mine three years ago,
and it still hurts.

145
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:31,154
And I hate...

146
00:11:33,893 --> 00:11:35,360
I hate black people.

147
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:39,330
I hate the way that they talk in movies.

148
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:43,324
I mean, it's got to bug the shit
out of you, too, right?

149
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:52,476
Hey, what time do you guys
want to practice tonight?

150
00:11:52,511 --> 00:11:55,002
I thought you guys were
DJing at Jones tonight.

151
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:56,071
Nah, it's tomorrow.

152
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:58,244
I got plans.

153
00:11:58,284 --> 00:12:00,411
That old married guy tonight?

154
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:01,442
He's not that old.

155
00:12:01,487 --> 00:12:03,512
But he is that married.

156
00:12:04,824 --> 00:12:07,691
Man, from here, he just seems
like somebody's dad.

157
00:12:09,195 --> 00:12:12,790
I got a feeling he's a little bit
more than just that.

158
00:12:18,137 --> 00:12:20,162
- Mr. Beckworth.
- Hi.

159
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:21,503
I'm Detective Frankie Graylin.

160
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,838
I know. I've seen you on TV.

161
00:12:26,112 --> 00:12:28,910
Great. So let's, uh, talk
about why you're here.

162
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:29,915
Right.

163
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:31,883
As you know, with your permission,

164
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:33,350
we searched your truck,

165
00:12:33,385 --> 00:12:36,149
and we found a strand of hair
that belonged to Ohristie Dillon.

166
00:12:36,188 --> 00:12:37,155
Right.

167
00:12:37,189 --> 00:12:39,054
I know you already
gave an explanation,

168
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:40,854
but I'd like to hear it again.

169
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:44,053
Okay.

170
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:46,587
About, um...

171
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:48,031
three weeks ago,

172
00:12:48,067 --> 00:12:51,696
I went to the park at the end of my street
to eat my lunch,

173
00:12:51,737 --> 00:12:55,138
and I saw Ohristie there
with one of her friends.

174
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:58,209
I think her name was Heather.

175
00:12:58,244 --> 00:13:02,112
And, anyway, Ohristie was, uh,
sort of helping, uh,

176
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:04,275
support, carry Heather,
who's limping.

177
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:07,911
Ohristie looked, uh,
a little overwhelmed,

178
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:10,421
'cause they had a couple
of bikes with 'em.

179
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:13,118
And where were you?
On a bench?

180
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:16,928
No, no, no. I was...
I was eating my lunch in my truck,

181
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:18,395
you know,
facing the softball field.

182
00:13:19,398 --> 00:13:20,262
Okay.

183
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:22,157
So, you know,
I got out of my truck,

184
00:13:22,201 --> 00:13:24,635
and, uh, you know,
I asked Ohristie

185
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:27,002
if she, you know,
needed some help.

186
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:29,473
And you know her?
Knew her?

187
00:13:29,508 --> 00:13:33,171
Oh, sure, yeah.
No, I've known Ohristie and her family

188
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:34,813
since Ohristie was little.

189
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:36,405
You know, I've been over their house,

190
00:13:36,448 --> 00:13:37,915
you know, to a holiday party
a couple times.

191
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:39,884
We do a big block party
on the Fourth of July.

192
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:40,886
It's a great neighborhood.

193
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,411
- I get it.
- Good. Right. Okay.

194
00:13:43,455 --> 00:13:46,720
So, uh, it turns out that Ohristie's friend,

195
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:49,387
uh, her ankle was banged up
pretty bad

196
00:13:49,428 --> 00:13:52,329
from falling off her bike, so, uh,

197
00:13:52,364 --> 00:13:54,696
I loaded their bikes
in the back of my truck,

198
00:13:54,733 --> 00:13:56,860
and I took the girls back
to Ohristie's house.

199
00:13:56,902 --> 00:13:59,496
And had Ohristie ever been
in your truck before?

200
00:13:59,538 --> 00:14:00,596
Uh, no.

201
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,938
No, that was the first
and, uh, the only time.

202
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:06,809
Oh. Is there a...

203
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:10,179
Are you currently in a relationship or...

204
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,745
No, I'm not.

205
00:14:15,788 --> 00:14:18,450
Uh, you know, my wife and I,

206
00:14:19,658 --> 00:14:23,150
you know, we got divorced,
like, 15 years ago,

207
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:29,100
and, uh, you know, I've had a couple
of relationships on and off since then,

208
00:14:29,134 --> 00:14:32,467
but nothing too serious
the last year or so, so...

209
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:35,440
How about you?

210
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:41,338
A-Are you seeing anybody, Frankie?

211
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:48,445
No, I'm currently not in a relationship.

212
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:54,552
Well, uh...

213
00:14:56,262 --> 00:14:57,354
This is probably really inappropriate,
but,

214
00:14:57,396 --> 00:15:00,024
you know, after all this,
you know, blows over,

215
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:01,498
I mean, when you guys find Ohristie,

216
00:15:01,533 --> 00:15:03,000
maybe you and I, we could...

217
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:05,265
we could have dinner or,
you know, we could...

218
00:15:08,007 --> 00:15:09,736
Wow, that was inappropriate.

219
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:13,641
Yes, it was very inappropriate.

220
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:15,237
I'm sorry. It's... I'm sorry.

221
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:16,248
It's you're very attractive.

222
00:15:16,282 --> 00:15:17,510
That was dumb. It was dumb.

223
00:15:17,549 --> 00:15:18,743
- Look, it's...
- No, it was dumb.

224
00:15:18,784 --> 00:15:20,046
- Sorry. I'm sorry. Sorry. Sorry.
- It's okay.

225
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:21,879
Okay.

226
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:22,888
It's all right.

227
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,389
Oh, God.

228
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:28,519
You know, actually I-I'm very flattered,

229
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:31,756
- but let's just leave it alone.
- Okay.

230
00:15:31,797 --> 00:15:34,732
All right. Uh, I think
we're done here for today.

231
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,234
Uh, can l... Am I done?

232
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:39,567
Yes. I will send somebody in
with your release papers.

233
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:42,039
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

234
00:15:45,344 --> 00:15:47,335
Oh, God.

235
00:16:03,862 --> 00:16:05,295
Ah, fuck.

236
00:16:37,062 --> 00:16:38,791
You know how fast you were going?

237
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:39,798
No. I'm sorry, officer.

238
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:42,062
I thought I was going
the speed limit.

239
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:44,934
No. You were going 39
in a 25-mile-per-hour zone.

240
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:47,733
License and registration, please?

241
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:48,762
Right.

242
00:17:00,986 --> 00:17:02,214
Okay.

243
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,232
You startled me.

244
00:17:24,276 --> 00:17:25,573
That was so quick.

245
00:17:25,611 --> 00:17:27,909
Well, l... I didn't
mean to scare you.

246
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:31,547
Look, this is...

247
00:17:32,584 --> 00:17:33,642
this is the end
of a school zone here,

248
00:17:33,685 --> 00:17:35,915
you know, which means
that there are a lot of kids around,

249
00:17:35,954 --> 00:17:37,251
playing, you know.

250
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:40,287
Sometimes they don't pay
much attention to traffic.

251
00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:43,792
You know, they mightjustjump
right out from behind a parked car

252
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:45,694
to chase down an overthrown football
or something,

253
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:47,756
and, the speed you're going,
you're not...

254
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,859
you're not gonna have
time to... to brake.

255
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:50,891
You know, so...

256
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:57,465
So just, you know, for everyone's sake,
slow down next time, okay?

257
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:00,171
You're not gonna give me a ticket?

258
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:05,273
Thank you.
Thank you so much, officer.

259
00:18:05,317 --> 00:18:07,911
I will totally be more careful
from now on.

260
00:18:07,953 --> 00:18:09,386
Okay.

261
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:10,388
You have a good day.

262
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:11,753
Thank you. You, too.

263
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:32,302
Hey, Mrs. Harrison.

264
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:35,033
Oh, Jerry, honey,
I got something for you.

265
00:19:39,545 --> 00:19:41,445
Um, how've you been?

266
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,846
Oh, I'm good. I'm good.

267
00:19:44,316 --> 00:19:45,214
Here.

268
00:19:46,418 --> 00:19:49,979
That's homemade brisket
with mashed potatoes and green beans.

269
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:53,522
You look like you don't eat,
so I made you a plate.

270
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:55,288
Oh, you didn't have to. It's...

271
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:56,885
Of course I did.

272
00:19:56,929 --> 00:20:00,763
It's not every day you graduate
from the police academy.

273
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,391
Oh, I'd have brought it
a couple of weeks ago,

274
00:20:02,434 --> 00:20:05,130
but I haven't been feeling well,
and I didn't want to take...

275
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:06,569
No, no, don't worry about that.

276
00:20:06,605 --> 00:20:09,039
It's... lt's very, very sweet of you.
Thank you very much.

277
00:20:09,074 --> 00:20:11,907
- Hi, Mrs. Harrison.
- Oh. Oarter.

278
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:12,933
Hey.

279
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:17,277
You know, you may want
to add a little salt to that,

280
00:20:17,316 --> 00:20:20,149
because I use lemon juice
instead of salt.

281
00:20:39,838 --> 00:20:43,171
Police are still refusing to refer
to Mr. Beckworth as a suspect,

282
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:46,473
but public pressure may
force them to do that soon.

283
00:20:46,511 --> 00:20:49,173
In Hawthorne today,
an elderly man...

284
00:21:13,472 --> 00:21:15,099
Dude, where you been?

285
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:17,131
Raid starts in three minutes.

286
00:21:17,175 --> 00:21:19,473
Sorry.
Parent-teacher meeting.

287
00:21:23,015 --> 00:21:24,346
God, and...

288
00:21:24,383 --> 00:21:27,580
he ate the whole thing.

289
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:29,951
- After he said it was...
- Yes.

290
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:36,222
Oh, no.

291
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:43,662
Oh, my God, thank you.

292
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:45,058
Thank you.

293
00:21:45,604 --> 00:21:47,333
I have not laughed like that in months.

294
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:50,908
Oh, how's Ryan?

295
00:21:52,744 --> 00:21:53,768
Great.

296
00:21:55,881 --> 00:21:58,111
And everything else?

297
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:03,186
Well, we're gonna do
in vitro this week.

298
00:22:04,589 --> 00:22:05,954
- That's great.
- Yep.

299
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:10,955
And, uh, Ryan's been very supportive,

300
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:13,521
uh, but it's a...

301
00:22:13,565 --> 00:22:15,897
it's a process.

302
00:22:15,934 --> 00:22:21,372
Um, it's just we're both
very committed to it,

303
00:22:21,406 --> 00:22:23,567
which makes it easier...

304
00:22:26,578 --> 00:22:27,909
normal.

305
00:22:28,413 --> 00:22:29,937
Hey, look who's on TV.

306
00:22:38,457 --> 00:22:40,652
You think he's guilty?

307
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:43,953
I know he is.

308
00:22:46,631 --> 00:22:48,895
I mean, she's like Tina's age.

309
00:22:50,068 --> 00:22:51,194
I mean, this fucking job,

310
00:22:51,236 --> 00:22:54,899
it's like a looking glass
into the soul of this world.

311
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:57,204
I mean, it's scary raising kids here.

312
00:22:57,242 --> 00:22:58,732
We have to lie to them
about everything.

313
00:22:58,777 --> 00:23:00,836
There's so many
bad things, bad people,

314
00:23:01,947 --> 00:23:03,414
and sometimes I wonder
why we try so hard

315
00:23:03,448 --> 00:23:05,609
when we're so clearly outnumbered.

316
00:23:10,655 --> 00:23:13,920
Oh, you know, I'm... I'm sorry.
I don't mean to...

317
00:23:13,959 --> 00:23:15,187
- No.
- It's...

318
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:16,216
No, it's fine.

319
00:23:18,764 --> 00:23:19,731
Drink.

320
00:23:19,765 --> 00:23:20,925
- Yes.
- Oheers.

321
00:23:21,366 --> 00:23:23,425
Here's to pain.

322
00:23:35,647 --> 00:23:36,636
Hey.

323
00:23:36,681 --> 00:23:39,707
Hey.
Still out with Frankie?

324
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:42,948
Yeah. I'm just about
finished, though.

325
00:23:43,288 --> 00:23:46,485
- Great. Tell her hello for me.
- Okay.

326
00:23:46,525 --> 00:23:48,493
See you at home in an hour?

327
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:54,291
Hello?
Ryan, are you there?

328
00:23:54,332 --> 00:23:56,323
Yeah. Yeah, uh...

329
00:23:56,368 --> 00:23:58,700
I lost you for a second.
What'd you say?

330
00:23:58,737 --> 00:24:01,900
I said I will meet you at home
in an hour. Okay?

331
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:04,568
Might be a little bit later.
I got to swing by Mom's.

332
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:09,744
Oh, um, okay.
Um, I'll see you after.

333
00:24:11,716 --> 00:24:13,206
I'll see you in a bit.

334
00:24:14,186 --> 00:24:15,380
I love you.

335
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:16,887
Me, too.

336
00:24:27,199 --> 00:24:29,463
Okay, 10 miles.

337
00:24:31,036 --> 00:24:32,560
How do you feel?

338
00:24:32,604 --> 00:24:34,538
I feel...

339
00:24:36,541 --> 00:24:38,304
I feel pretty good, actually.

340
00:24:43,081 --> 00:24:45,413
Ah, Ohrist,
I'm sweating like a rapist.

341
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:51,611
And you, you haven't
even broken a sweat yet.

342
00:24:53,124 --> 00:24:56,890
Here we go. There.

343
00:24:56,928 --> 00:24:59,726
Now at least you look like
you've been running.

344
00:25:10,075 --> 00:25:12,771
A-Are you Drew Oallahan?

345
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:16,371
Taylor Reese.
I was friends with Erik.

346
00:25:16,414 --> 00:25:18,644
We played football
together in high school.

347
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:21,151
I was the one that threw him
all those touchdowns.

348
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:22,676
Remember that?

349
00:25:22,721 --> 00:25:24,279
I think I met you, um,

350
00:25:24,322 --> 00:25:26,847
our senior year after that game
against Drake.

351
00:25:26,892 --> 00:25:29,292
You have to remember that one.
It was a real barnburner.

352
00:25:29,327 --> 00:25:31,261
- Right, yeah.
- State championship.

353
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,292
Taylor, right.

354
00:25:36,968 --> 00:25:39,835
Sorry, uh, kind of pathetic,

355
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:43,307
a 35-year-old guy reliving
his high school glory.

356
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:46,276
No, it's, uh...

357
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:58,856
Well, listen, it was
really good seeing you.

358
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:02,485
Uh, if you see your brother Erik,
let him...

359
00:26:03,528 --> 00:26:05,018
Here. Give me...

360
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:07,964
Uh, hope everything's
going good for you.

361
00:26:16,641 --> 00:26:18,666
Say hi to Erik for me.

362
00:26:55,146 --> 00:26:57,944
So have you heard
from your dad lately?

363
00:26:58,717 --> 00:27:00,810
Yeah, I talked to him
about a week ago.

364
00:27:00,852 --> 00:27:03,286
Oh, you should talk
to him more often.

365
00:27:03,321 --> 00:27:05,346
I spoke to him yesterday.

366
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:10,624
I think he might be coming home
for Ohristmas this year.

367
00:27:11,329 --> 00:27:13,456
Has he said anything
to you about that?

368
00:27:14,366 --> 00:27:17,767
Uh, no, he didn't...
he didn't say anything.

369
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:21,738
Hmm. Well, it really
will be a merry Ohristmas

370
00:27:21,773 --> 00:27:25,038
if he can just get all that stuff
from that estate finalized

371
00:27:25,076 --> 00:27:26,100
and get home.

372
00:27:26,911 --> 00:27:30,347
Maybe by then, you and Kate'll
have a special gift on the way,

373
00:27:30,382 --> 00:27:33,442
and then, you know,
it'll be a perfect Ohristmas.

374
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:38,478
Why are you listening
to Ohristmas music?

375
00:27:41,059 --> 00:27:43,721
Oh, because it's beautiful...

376
00:27:44,696 --> 00:27:46,994
happy, makes me happy.

377
00:27:47,132 --> 00:27:48,497
It's June.

378
00:27:48,533 --> 00:27:49,761
So?

379
00:27:49,801 --> 00:27:51,666
Ohristmas is six months away, Mom.

380
00:27:51,703 --> 00:27:55,298
Well, why should I wait
six months to be happy?

381
00:28:11,122 --> 00:28:16,788
You are relentless in the way

382
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:20,892
That you ask me

383
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:31,134
So many questions

384
00:28:32,944 --> 00:28:35,970
Of my days

385
00:28:37,682 --> 00:28:39,775
In the calm city

386
00:28:40,952 --> 00:28:43,580
Of my days

387
00:28:44,456 --> 00:28:48,153
In the city

388
00:28:48,193 --> 00:28:52,527
You are relentless in the way

389
00:28:53,765 --> 00:28:56,359
That you ask...

390
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:58,961
Ask me

391
00:28:59,771 --> 00:29:03,070
So many questions

392
00:29:03,108 --> 00:29:08,171
Of my days...

393
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:44,241
How's your mom?

394
00:29:46,684 --> 00:29:48,982
Other than the fact
my dad told her

395
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:52,979
he might be coming home
for Ohristmas, terrific.

396
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,760
Your dad's coming home
for Ohristmas?

397
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:57,386
Of course not, Kate.

398
00:29:58,096 --> 00:30:00,621
It's been nine years.
He's never coming back.

399
00:30:01,699 --> 00:30:05,191
I don't know why my mother
can't get that through her skull!

400
00:30:06,604 --> 00:30:08,868
I win. I win.

401
00:30:08,907 --> 00:30:11,933
I've got the most fucked-up
parents on the planet.

402
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,775
My mother's an idiot.

403
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:20,240
He lies to her, Ryan.

404
00:30:20,285 --> 00:30:22,685
He's the one you
should be angry with.

405
00:30:23,021 --> 00:30:25,615
He tells her that he's dealing
with his parents' estate.

406
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:27,921
He tells her that the French government
is screwing everything up.

407
00:30:27,959 --> 00:30:28,926
He tells her that his...

408
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,053
his heart problem
prohibits him from flying.

409
00:30:31,095 --> 00:30:32,323
For nine years!

410
00:30:32,363 --> 00:30:34,058
Who believes that?

411
00:30:34,098 --> 00:30:35,861
I know. I get it.

412
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,527
It's not exactly...

413
00:30:37,569 --> 00:30:38,968
Normal.

414
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:42,964
Practical.

415
00:30:50,548 --> 00:30:53,312
She believes what
she wants to believe,

416
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:56,684
what she needs to believe
in order to survive.

417
00:31:08,499 --> 00:31:11,559
The results came back from Dr. Klein.

418
00:31:14,072 --> 00:31:16,404
Your sperm passed the test.

419
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:19,003
Great.

420
00:31:20,011 --> 00:31:22,343
At least my cum's
got its shit together.

421
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,806
Yeah.

422
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:26,877
So, um,

423
00:31:28,019 --> 00:31:30,385
we can have sex tonight.

424
00:31:30,989 --> 00:31:35,983
Um, then no sex for 48 hours,

425
00:31:36,027 --> 00:31:39,190
but, uh, we can tonight if you want.

426
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:40,356
You don't have to.

427
00:31:41,499 --> 00:31:42,261
I'm okay.

428
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:45,565
I'm fine, good to go.

429
00:32:04,689 --> 00:32:06,122
I'm gonna go upstairs.

430
00:32:10,194 --> 00:32:12,185
I'll be upstairs.

431
00:33:01,779 --> 00:33:03,269
Hi.

432
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:43,616
Hey, how are you
doing this morning?

433
00:33:43,654 --> 00:33:44,621
Good.

434
00:33:44,655 --> 00:33:46,486
Uh, chocolate sugar twist,

435
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:49,652
three doughnut holes
and a black coffee.

436
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:50,683
Yeah.

437
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:08,638
Earlier this evening,
family, friends and supporters

438
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:11,170
gathered for a vigil
for the missing girl.

439
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:12,842
Anybody watching this?

440
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:14,647
...as far as Fresno came,
bringing flowers...

441
00:34:14,685 --> 00:34:16,243
Good.

442
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:18,647
Just want to check
the Dodger highlights.

443
00:34:18,689 --> 00:34:20,987
Two on and two outs.
And Johnson's first hit,

444
00:34:21,025 --> 00:34:23,550
and laces it into the gap
in left center field.

445
00:34:23,594 --> 00:34:26,154
Parilla scores, Revie scores,
and Hudson hasn't...

446
00:34:31,269 --> 00:34:33,533
All right, so we've left
Maggie in the park, right?

447
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:35,471
And she's got her one-year-old,
and they're in the stroller,

448
00:34:35,506 --> 00:34:37,030
and as they're walking
to the playground,

449
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:39,635
she sees this really
hot black couple.

450
00:34:39,677 --> 00:34:41,645
African-American.

451
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:44,671
We have an African-American
president, Archie Bunker.

452
00:34:44,715 --> 00:34:45,682
Okay, all right.

453
00:34:45,716 --> 00:34:47,115
Well, I didn't vote for him.

454
00:34:47,151 --> 00:34:50,780
So, uh, anyway, this super-hot
African-American couple

455
00:34:50,822 --> 00:34:53,120
has got a ridiculously cute
African-American baby

456
00:34:53,157 --> 00:34:55,148
also in a stroller,
and as the two groups

457
00:34:55,193 --> 00:34:56,251
approach each other,
you know,

458
00:34:56,294 --> 00:34:57,659
they're oohing and ahhing
over the babies

459
00:34:57,695 --> 00:34:59,663
and saying the other one's
cuter and all this stuff,

460
00:34:59,697 --> 00:35:01,688
and, uh, Maggie asks
how old her son is,

461
00:35:01,732 --> 00:35:03,666
and she gets down
in front of the stroller

462
00:35:03,701 --> 00:35:04,668
and says,
"Hi, little monkey!"

463
00:35:07,538 --> 00:35:08,527
No, okay, come on.

464
00:35:08,573 --> 00:35:10,370
Bear with... This really
happened to my wife.

465
00:35:10,408 --> 00:35:11,534
M-My wife really did this.

466
00:35:11,576 --> 00:35:13,237
Um, and so right after
Maggie says this,

467
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:15,541
she gets that hilarious look
on her face, you know,

468
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:17,207
and she immediately
turns to her son

469
00:35:17,248 --> 00:35:19,273
and goes, "And here's
my little monkey." You know?

470
00:35:19,317 --> 00:35:21,285
And she's so embarrassed

471
00:35:21,319 --> 00:35:23,617
that she just calls everything...
man, woman, child, animal...

472
00:35:23,654 --> 00:35:25,781
everything's a monkey.
Monkey, monkey, monkey, monkey.

473
00:35:25,823 --> 00:35:27,222
She just keeps saying
everything's a monkey,

474
00:35:27,258 --> 00:35:28,748
and the other couple, I mean,

475
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:30,226
they're just kind of
backing away from her,

476
00:35:30,261 --> 00:35:31,193
you know, not sure.

477
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:34,758
What do you think?

478
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:37,768
I didn't know your wife
was such a racist.

479
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:40,498
Shut up, Allan.

480
00:35:40,538 --> 00:35:42,130
Wh-What do you think?

481
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:43,933
Allie?

482
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:44,942
It's great.

483
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:46,102
I think it's kind of funny.

484
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:48,612
Is it... ls it too offensive?

485
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:50,011
I don't think so.

486
00:35:51,082 --> 00:35:52,572
Were you even listening?

487
00:35:52,617 --> 00:35:56,314
Yeah. I just... I don't get
why you're asking me.

488
00:35:58,222 --> 00:35:59,120
Oome on, Allie.
Are you serious?

489
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:00,852
I mean,
you're the only black...

490
00:36:00,892 --> 00:36:03,520
uh, the only African-American
writer in the room.

491
00:36:03,561 --> 00:36:06,086
Way to point out
the obvious, Bill.

492
00:36:07,031 --> 00:36:11,127
I just don't get why you would think
that I would know if that's bad or not.

493
00:36:12,703 --> 00:36:13,863
It's a misunderstanding.

494
00:36:13,905 --> 00:36:15,167
It's funny.

495
00:36:15,206 --> 00:36:17,367
Anybody who thinks that's racist

496
00:36:17,408 --> 00:36:19,603
is probably some
uptight black asshole

497
00:36:19,644 --> 00:36:21,669
who wishes somebody
would call him a monkey

498
00:36:21,712 --> 00:36:23,202
so he could complain about it.

499
00:36:24,081 --> 00:36:28,142
Finding reasons to complain
is just another form of laziness,

500
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:32,179
and honestly I don't have
the time or the tolerance for it.

501
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:42,030
You do know those lids
come off, right?

502
00:36:43,267 --> 00:36:45,667
Thank you, class.

503
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:47,398
You did good.

504
00:36:47,438 --> 00:36:48,735
See you tomorrow.

505
00:36:50,841 --> 00:36:51,967
Mr. Aston.

506
00:36:52,009 --> 00:36:53,169
Yeah, Tina?

507
00:36:54,345 --> 00:36:57,314
Um, you know how you
were talking about that...

508
00:36:58,316 --> 00:37:00,511
talking about
Martin Luther King last week

509
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:03,987
and how he, you know,
put himself in harm's way

510
00:37:04,021 --> 00:37:05,249
so that others
could have a better life?

511
00:37:05,957 --> 00:37:07,049
Sure do.

512
00:37:07,525 --> 00:37:10,358
Well, my mom and I went online
and read some more about him.

513
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:11,554
Really?

514
00:37:11,596 --> 00:37:14,087
Yeah, and, um,

515
00:37:15,299 --> 00:37:17,267
it made me sad
what happened to him.

516
00:37:18,502 --> 00:37:21,096
I was wondering,
do you think the world

517
00:37:22,873 --> 00:37:24,238
would have been a better place
if he hadn't been killed?

518
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:28,769
I don't know,

519
00:37:28,813 --> 00:37:32,613
but it sure became a better place
because he was alive.

520
00:37:35,219 --> 00:37:38,586
Yeah. Yeah, that's true.

521
00:37:39,123 --> 00:37:41,091
Well, thanks for
telling us about him.

522
00:37:41,125 --> 00:37:42,217
Sure.

523
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,490
- Bye.
- Bye.

524
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,525
Do you love her?

525
00:38:29,507 --> 00:38:34,342
Love? I'm starting
to think that I, uh...

526
00:38:34,378 --> 00:38:37,905
I'm not so certain
what that word means.

527
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:41,714
You know, intellectually I do, but...

528
00:38:44,388 --> 00:38:46,356
intimate love...

529
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:53,863
I seem to have emotionally
forgotten what that means.

530
00:38:59,537 --> 00:39:01,266
She's like my mom.

531
00:39:02,573 --> 00:39:07,510
They just insulate
themselves from reality.

532
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:13,579
It's like they're looking at life
through a windshield,

533
00:39:14,251 --> 00:39:17,778
so thick that they could watch
a nuclear explosion.

534
00:39:18,823 --> 00:39:21,257
I don't even have
a glass in mine...

535
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:27,561
and the wind's whipping me
and making my eyes teary,

536
00:39:27,598 --> 00:39:30,260
and I can barely even
keep them open.

537
00:39:34,405 --> 00:39:36,635
- Great choices.
- Thanks.

538
00:39:37,575 --> 00:39:38,872
I love this dress.

539
00:39:38,909 --> 00:39:41,901
Did you see the adorable
little shoes that go with it?

540
00:39:41,946 --> 00:39:43,811
- No.
- Oh, my gosh.

541
00:39:43,848 --> 00:39:45,748
How cute are these?

542
00:39:47,151 --> 00:39:48,914
Very. I'll get those, too.

543
00:39:48,953 --> 00:39:49,942
Okay, great.

544
00:39:49,987 --> 00:39:51,352
Are these gifts?

545
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:53,380
Um...

546
00:39:53,424 --> 00:39:54,721
uh, this one is.

547
00:39:54,759 --> 00:39:58,695
Okay. Your daughter's gonna
look so cute in this dress.

548
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:06,354
Uh, hey, sorry.

549
00:41:06,397 --> 00:41:07,694
Excuse me.

550
00:41:08,232 --> 00:41:10,666
You don't happen to know
whose dog this is, do you?

551
00:41:10,701 --> 00:41:12,828
No. Sorry.

552
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:14,861
Well, It's just that
I found it in the street

553
00:41:14,905 --> 00:41:15,894
running around the other day.

554
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:17,737
It didn't have a collar or anything.

555
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:19,776
She's cute.

556
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:21,072
You should keep her.

557
00:41:22,346 --> 00:41:24,280
Wait. It's a girl?

558
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:26,840
Yes.

559
00:41:26,884 --> 00:41:29,512
You might want to make sure
she's fixed.

560
00:41:29,553 --> 00:41:31,783
Right, make sure she's neutered.

561
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:34,450
Spayed. Boys get neutered.

562
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:37,052
Spayed, not neutered.

563
00:41:37,094 --> 00:41:38,584
- No.
- No.

564
00:41:38,629 --> 00:41:41,257
I'll let you know if I hear anything.

565
00:41:41,298 --> 00:41:43,289
Okay, thanks.

566
00:41:51,275 --> 00:41:52,674
Everyone's here.
We're good to go.

567
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:53,870
Gonzo, you're the main tank.

568
00:41:53,911 --> 00:41:55,378
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

569
00:41:55,412 --> 00:41:57,107
Remember this guy heals,
so get ready.

570
00:41:57,147 --> 00:41:59,877
Today marks the fourth day since
little Ohristie Dillon's disappearance.

571
00:41:59,917 --> 00:42:01,384
Her father Paul held
a news conference

572
00:42:01,418 --> 00:42:05,047
out in front of his house
to defend himself against accusations

573
00:42:05,089 --> 00:42:06,579
that he somehow
may have been involved.

574
00:42:06,624 --> 00:42:08,114
Gonz, you want it?

575
00:42:08,158 --> 00:42:09,455
Uh, yeah.

576
00:42:10,094 --> 00:42:11,459
Jim, use your fire magic, dude!

577
00:42:11,495 --> 00:42:13,258
All right, I got it! I got it!

578
00:42:13,297 --> 00:42:15,060
...dragging their feet
in this investigation.

579
00:42:15,799 --> 00:42:16,561
On Oapitol Hill today...

580
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,261
Watch your flank!
Watch your flank!

581
00:42:18,302 --> 00:42:19,735
- It's on your six!
- Shit.

582
00:42:21,338 --> 00:42:23,806
- Uh, I, uh...
- Unbelievable!

583
00:42:23,841 --> 00:42:25,331
You're thinking about the princess!

584
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:26,977
She was taken from her home.

585
00:42:27,011 --> 00:42:28,638
We can'tjust leave her there.

586
00:42:30,614 --> 00:42:33,412
- Dude, you just wiped the raid!
- Jesus, Gonz!

587
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:35,111
We need to focus up!

588
00:42:36,787 --> 00:42:39,415
I have to leave,
help the princess.

589
00:42:39,790 --> 00:42:40,654
What? You can't!

590
00:42:40,691 --> 00:42:43,387
If you do that, you're out for good!
Where are you going?

591
00:42:43,427 --> 00:42:45,054
Oome on, dude. He's an asshole.
Get rid of him.

592
00:42:45,095 --> 00:42:46,062
Here we go! Oome on!

593
00:42:46,096 --> 00:42:47,324
W-Where is he going?

594
00:42:47,364 --> 00:42:49,025
How are we gonna heal
without him?

595
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:50,090
Oome on! That's insane!

596
00:42:50,134 --> 00:42:51,658
We're finally gonna get this guy!

597
00:42:51,702 --> 00:42:52,828
I can't believe this.

598
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:54,929
We're gonna have to start
this level all over!

599
00:42:58,642 --> 00:43:03,045
I lost my job at the magazine
three months ago.

600
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:05,412
I don't know. The, um...

601
00:43:05,449 --> 00:43:09,249
The pressure of work
and taking care of him...

602
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:11,948
itjust got to me.

603
00:43:16,627 --> 00:43:18,822
Everyone thinks he's brain-dead...

604
00:43:22,399 --> 00:43:23,627
except me.

605
00:43:25,836 --> 00:43:27,770
And I know he's not

606
00:43:27,805 --> 00:43:30,797
because of the way
he looks at me sometimes.

607
00:43:34,011 --> 00:43:36,206
I know he's in there,

608
00:43:36,246 --> 00:43:44,779
and that's why l...
we gotta do this race.

609
00:43:47,257 --> 00:43:49,657
He always wanted to run
that fucking thing.

610
00:43:52,096 --> 00:43:56,465
He's run every other major city
marathon in the country.

611
00:44:00,037 --> 00:44:01,664
This was from his last race,

612
00:44:02,706 --> 00:44:04,264
the San Francisco Marathon.

613
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:06,640
He placed in the top
30th percentile.

614
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:11,603
Somehow I don't think
we're gonna do that good this time.

615
00:44:14,418 --> 00:44:15,851
We're gonna finish it.

616
00:44:17,554 --> 00:44:20,580
We're gonna finish it.

617
00:44:26,563 --> 00:44:30,863
Yeah. No, I understand
what you're saying.

618
00:44:30,901 --> 00:44:32,129
Oh, Ohrist.

619
00:44:32,169 --> 00:44:35,070
I thought that we had
gotten past that, Greg.

620
00:44:35,105 --> 00:44:38,006
You're clinging to this theory
like a frigging flat-Earther.

621
00:44:38,042 --> 00:44:39,373
It doesn't hold water.

622
00:44:41,178 --> 00:44:44,204
You can't expect me
to believe that her parents

623
00:44:44,248 --> 00:44:48,184
think that she would
intentionally hurt Erik.

624
00:44:48,218 --> 00:44:50,948
Well, that is absolutely crazy talk.

625
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:54,752
Fine.

626
00:44:54,792 --> 00:44:56,419
Bring it to the arbitrator.

627
00:44:56,460 --> 00:44:57,449
Let him decide.

628
00:45:00,064 --> 00:45:03,363
Yeah. Yeah.

629
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:05,891
She's sober.

630
00:45:05,936 --> 00:45:09,064
Her tests come back
negative every week.

631
00:45:09,106 --> 00:45:11,267
That means she's clean.

632
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:15,777
Oh, fine.

633
00:45:15,813 --> 00:45:18,714
No, I don't have anything else.

634
00:45:18,749 --> 00:45:21,741
Thank you for being
so fucking reasonable, Greg!

635
00:45:21,785 --> 00:45:24,447
I hope that you
can sleep well tonight.

636
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:27,713
Orap.

637
00:46:09,833 --> 00:46:11,460
You still haven't found the owner?

638
00:46:11,502 --> 00:46:12,526
Oh, yeah.

639
00:46:12,569 --> 00:46:15,629
I mean, no, not...
not yet.

640
00:46:17,307 --> 00:46:18,365
Hey.

641
00:46:18,408 --> 00:46:21,639
She's a, um... a weim...

642
00:46:21,678 --> 00:46:23,305
How do you say it?

643
00:46:23,347 --> 00:46:24,405
Weimaraner.

644
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:25,437
Weimaraner. Yeah.

645
00:46:25,482 --> 00:46:28,280
Right, I can never remember that.

646
00:46:28,318 --> 00:46:29,285
Hey.

647
00:46:29,319 --> 00:46:31,287
Are you planning a trip somewhere?

648
00:46:31,321 --> 00:46:33,414
Oh, no, I'm just...

649
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:35,755
l... I don't know.

650
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:38,523
Maybe sometime,
but not... not now.

651
00:46:42,599 --> 00:46:43,896
She's really cute.

652
00:46:43,934 --> 00:46:45,265
Have you named her?

653
00:46:45,302 --> 00:46:47,361
I'm just calling her
Oarol right now.

654
00:46:47,404 --> 00:46:48,371
Wha...

655
00:46:48,405 --> 00:46:49,736
Yikes. Oarol?

656
00:46:49,773 --> 00:46:51,604
It's... I don't know.
It's my sister's name.

657
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:52,904
I guess I don't really...

658
00:46:52,943 --> 00:46:55,741
I just don't really know
that many girls' names.

659
00:46:58,482 --> 00:46:59,676
What's your name?

660
00:47:02,286 --> 00:47:04,015
E-Evan.

661
00:47:04,054 --> 00:47:06,147
Hi.

662
00:47:06,623 --> 00:47:08,215
I'm Allegra.

663
00:47:08,258 --> 00:47:11,022
Now you know two girls' names.

664
00:47:15,399 --> 00:47:16,297
You know, it's really nice

665
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:19,632
to have a guy on the beat
in the neighborhood.

666
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:22,434
Makes everyone feel safer,
you know.

667
00:47:22,472 --> 00:47:24,633
Thanks, Tony.
I appreciate that.

668
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:25,903
Wait right here.

669
00:47:36,854 --> 00:47:38,151
You don't tell anyone.

670
00:47:38,188 --> 00:47:39,485
This is for you.

671
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:42,492
Oh, l... I, uh...

672
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:45,188
It's policy.
I-I'm not allowed.

673
00:47:45,229 --> 00:47:46,560
Policy?

674
00:47:46,597 --> 00:47:47,564
Yeah.

675
00:47:47,598 --> 00:47:49,259
It's ridiculous. It's cannoli.

676
00:47:52,069 --> 00:47:56,563
Um, l... I could buy it.

677
00:47:58,342 --> 00:48:01,539
They're on special,
two for a dollar.

678
00:48:01,578 --> 00:48:03,273
I get 4 bucks apiece for those.

679
00:48:03,313 --> 00:48:06,510
Yeah, that's a... that's
a pretty good special.

680
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:08,211
Here.

681
00:48:08,252 --> 00:48:09,344
All right.

682
00:48:43,654 --> 00:48:45,645
You know we're in a drought.

683
00:48:47,524 --> 00:48:48,923
Hey, Detective.

684
00:48:51,395 --> 00:48:54,796
Are you doing the work
on this house alone?

685
00:48:54,831 --> 00:48:58,028
Yeah, uh...
Yeah.

686
00:48:58,068 --> 00:49:00,093
Yeah, it's a labor of love, you know.

687
00:49:00,137 --> 00:49:02,264
Six months, it's... it's a big job.

688
00:49:04,141 --> 00:49:06,609
So did you come here
to admire my house,

689
00:49:06,643 --> 00:49:09,271
or you, uh... you gonna
take me up on my offer,

690
00:49:09,313 --> 00:49:13,306
you know, picnic, a drink, dinner?

691
00:49:13,350 --> 00:49:16,649
No. No, actually, uh,

692
00:49:16,687 --> 00:49:19,315
I need your help about something.

693
00:49:19,356 --> 00:49:22,325
See, I was thinking about
the statement you gave

694
00:49:22,359 --> 00:49:25,192
inside the station yesterday, and...

695
00:49:25,228 --> 00:49:27,355
and something doesn't seem right.

696
00:49:27,397 --> 00:49:29,126
What's that?

697
00:49:29,666 --> 00:49:31,827
Why were you eating lunch
at the softball field

698
00:49:31,868 --> 00:49:34,166
the day you picked up
Ohristie and Heather?

699
00:49:38,041 --> 00:49:39,338
I beg your pardon?

700
00:49:40,210 --> 00:49:43,008
Well, I mean, you said
you eat lunch there every day,

701
00:49:43,046 --> 00:49:45,537
but when I asked the neighbors
around the field

702
00:49:45,582 --> 00:49:47,447
if they'd ever
seen your truck before,

703
00:49:47,484 --> 00:49:49,076
they said no, never seen it.

704
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:50,416
Well, they're just plain wrong.

705
00:49:50,454 --> 00:49:52,820
I go there every day.
L... I eat my sandwich.

706
00:49:52,856 --> 00:49:55,086
I watch a T-ball game
or a softball game.

707
00:49:55,125 --> 00:49:56,786
Oan you prove that,
Mr. Beckworth?

708
00:49:57,794 --> 00:50:01,696
I don't go there
at the same time every day.

709
00:50:01,732 --> 00:50:04,792
I don't eat my lunch
at any set hour.

710
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:08,464
It's funny. The mothers
that live around that field,

711
00:50:08,505 --> 00:50:09,938
they're kind of nosy,

712
00:50:09,973 --> 00:50:12,942
and they have a really great
Neighborhood Watch program.

713
00:50:12,976 --> 00:50:15,501
Detective, I'm not
gonna argue with you.

714
00:50:15,545 --> 00:50:19,208
I've got no reason to lie about
eating my sandwich at Memorial Park,

715
00:50:19,249 --> 00:50:21,843
whether I show up there
at 3:00 or 12:00

716
00:50:21,885 --> 00:50:26,185
or park my truck a foot away
from where it was the day before.

717
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:33,193
Please,

718
00:50:34,731 --> 00:50:36,062
believe me.

719
00:50:41,772 --> 00:50:43,262
Right.

720
00:50:55,786 --> 00:50:57,947
Forget about the drought.

721
00:50:57,988 --> 00:51:00,650
A garden like that's gonna
attract a lot of attention.

722
00:51:01,491 --> 00:51:02,822
You gonna give me a ticket?

723
00:51:02,859 --> 00:51:04,850
No. It's not my department.

724
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:07,693
I was just, you know...

725
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:09,426
You giving me a warning?

726
00:51:10,434 --> 00:51:12,425
Well, thank you for the warning.

727
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:47,759
Don't start with me.

728
00:51:49,272 --> 00:51:51,297
I've had a hell of a day.

729
00:51:53,810 --> 00:51:56,176
We're gonna run
14 miles tomorrow,

730
00:51:56,213 --> 00:52:00,513
and then I think we need
to start pulling back by Sunday, okay?

731
00:52:01,885 --> 00:52:03,409
Oh, shit.

732
00:52:03,453 --> 00:52:06,183
Ohh. I forgot
she was coming by.

733
00:52:06,223 --> 00:52:07,713
Ooming!

734
00:52:09,226 --> 00:52:10,454
Don't move.

735
00:52:15,198 --> 00:52:16,392
Sorry about that.

736
00:52:16,433 --> 00:52:18,492
I totally forgot about the time,
but come on back.

737
00:52:22,272 --> 00:52:24,706
Oh. Um, if you're busy, I can...

738
00:52:24,741 --> 00:52:26,368
No, it's fine. Oome in.

739
00:52:26,409 --> 00:52:27,569
He's not shy.

740
00:52:27,611 --> 00:52:29,238
Okay.

741
00:52:48,331 --> 00:52:49,389
Sorry about that.

742
00:52:50,634 --> 00:52:51,828
It always happens around
attractive women.

743
00:53:00,243 --> 00:53:01,710
This is my brother.

744
00:53:05,482 --> 00:53:08,542
Hello, Erik. I'm Kate.

745
00:53:11,221 --> 00:53:13,451
Oan you hand me the,
um, pitcher behind you?

746
00:53:14,891 --> 00:53:16,256
Thank you.

747
00:53:16,293 --> 00:53:17,692
- Thanks.
- Sure.

748
00:53:26,369 --> 00:53:27,563
Actually,

749
00:53:28,738 --> 00:53:30,433
do you think
you could give me a hand?

750
00:53:30,473 --> 00:53:31,565
Of course. Of course.

751
00:53:31,608 --> 00:53:33,007
What, uh... What can I do?

752
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:34,977
I'm gonna lift him,
and if you could just rinse

753
00:53:35,011 --> 00:53:36,638
the, uh, soap out of his hair.

754
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:37,738
Yes.

755
00:53:39,115 --> 00:53:41,481
Okay.

756
00:53:41,518 --> 00:53:43,247
There we go.

757
00:53:43,286 --> 00:53:45,618
- Okay? Just like this?
- Yeah.

758
00:53:46,957 --> 00:53:48,219
That's great.

759
00:54:08,878 --> 00:54:09,867
Thanks.

760
00:54:11,481 --> 00:54:14,450
I was gonna get
his hair cut for Sunday,

761
00:54:14,484 --> 00:54:17,681
but I think it looks
pretty good longer.

762
00:54:17,721 --> 00:54:18,949
Don't you?

763
00:54:20,690 --> 00:54:23,557
Yeah, I like it long.

764
00:54:23,593 --> 00:54:25,857
What do you think
of the moustache?

765
00:54:28,031 --> 00:54:30,397
Um, let's see.

766
00:54:32,168 --> 00:54:33,795
I like the moustache.

767
00:54:35,272 --> 00:54:36,330
I hate it.

768
00:54:39,709 --> 00:54:41,677
Will you hold up his arm?

769
00:54:41,711 --> 00:54:43,702
Um, yeah.

770
00:55:01,731 --> 00:55:03,028
Thanks.

771
00:55:10,874 --> 00:55:13,274
So you've been sober
about six months now.

772
00:55:19,015 --> 00:55:20,744
How exactly did that happen?

773
00:55:20,784 --> 00:55:25,380
Did you wake up one morning
and decide that you'd hit rock bottom?

774
00:55:26,890 --> 00:55:31,623
Um, I think it was more
like I hit the bottom,

775
00:55:31,661 --> 00:55:33,959
and then the rock fell on me.

776
00:55:41,204 --> 00:55:43,798
You don't think we're gonna
win this case, do you?

777
00:55:50,113 --> 00:55:52,104
Isn't this hard for you?

778
00:55:54,150 --> 00:55:57,916
Yeah. Yeah, it's hard.

779
00:55:57,954 --> 00:56:00,354
It's really fucking hard,

780
00:56:00,390 --> 00:56:03,223
hardest thing I've ever done.

781
00:56:04,327 --> 00:56:05,453
You have kids?

782
00:56:06,730 --> 00:56:07,628
No.

783
00:56:07,664 --> 00:56:09,029
Me neither.

784
00:56:10,533 --> 00:56:13,434
But I imagine it's a lot
like having a baby.

785
00:56:13,470 --> 00:56:17,668
A really big, heavy baby
that you have to shave

786
00:56:17,707 --> 00:56:20,335
and you get to curse around.

787
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:27,183
You didn't answer my question.

788
00:56:32,188 --> 00:56:34,748
He can't go in one of those places.

789
00:56:34,791 --> 00:56:36,349
He needs me.

790
00:56:38,194 --> 00:56:39,786
And I need him.

791
00:56:52,275 --> 00:56:54,334
Armando Hyde.

792
00:56:55,945 --> 00:56:58,812
"Armando Hyde, 38,
died Monday, June 11,

793
00:56:58,848 --> 00:57:02,181
"after a long battle
with colon cancer,

794
00:57:02,218 --> 00:57:06,348
"survived by his wife
of nine years, Judy,

795
00:57:06,389 --> 00:57:09,415
"and their two-year-old
daughter, Ohristine.

796
00:57:09,459 --> 00:57:11,859
"Judy and Samuel met

797
00:57:11,895 --> 00:57:14,227
during their freshman year
at Michigan State University."

798
00:57:17,066 --> 00:57:20,092
"Family will receive friends

799
00:57:20,136 --> 00:57:22,400
4:30 to 6:30 Saturday."

800
00:57:24,541 --> 00:57:25,940
"Saint Theodore Ohurch."

801
00:57:54,070 --> 00:57:56,368
What I've got

802
00:57:56,406 --> 00:57:59,569
Is a man that's right for me

803
00:57:59,609 --> 00:58:02,476
This man is a lucky man

804
00:58:02,512 --> 00:58:04,605
He's kicking my ass

805
00:58:04,647 --> 00:58:07,480
And lootin' my drawers for free

806
00:58:07,517 --> 00:58:11,351
A nickel for my pickle

807
00:58:11,387 --> 00:58:13,446
What I got

808
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:17,551
Is a man that's right for me

809
00:58:17,594 --> 00:58:19,619
Sounds really good.

810
00:58:26,536 --> 00:58:28,970
Good birthday so far?

811
00:58:32,175 --> 00:58:34,439
Best birthday
now that you're here.

812
00:58:38,715 --> 00:58:41,707
A couple of friends took me
to Katsuya for dinner,

813
00:58:41,751 --> 00:58:45,050
and I made them promise
to get me back by 10:00.

814
00:58:45,088 --> 00:58:46,555
You didn't have to do that.

815
00:58:46,589 --> 00:58:48,557
Oould have done this
on another night.

816
00:58:48,591 --> 00:58:51,458
No, I've been waiting
for this all day.

817
00:58:54,163 --> 00:58:56,324
All right, wait a second.
Wait a second. Hold on.

818
00:58:56,366 --> 00:58:58,926
Don't you want to talk a little bit
before your birthday fuck?

819
00:58:58,968 --> 00:58:59,832
No.

820
00:59:01,204 --> 00:59:02,262
Wait here.

821
00:59:05,308 --> 00:59:07,367
Okay.
