1
00:01:47,897 --> 00:01:49,022
Doctor's log.

2
00:01:49,113 --> 00:01:52,226
It's day 243 in this...

3
00:01:52,482 --> 00:01:54,440
portobello purgatory.

4
00:01:55,272 --> 00:01:57,689
My only companion is a rock I named Stone.

5
00:02:00,834 --> 00:02:04,542
The question is,
for whom am I narrating this?

6
00:02:06,672 --> 00:02:10,164
It seems I've become a featured player
in the theater of the absurd.

7
00:02:10,272 --> 00:02:13,564
Marooned in deep space
by that wretched blue rodent.

8
00:02:13,566 --> 00:02:17,983
But it's all good, thanks to a breathable
atmosphere and my supreme intellect,

9
00:02:17,985 --> 00:02:21,298
sharpened against the only competitor
savvy enough to bring it.

10
00:02:21,298 --> 00:02:22,980
Chanterelle to d4.

11
00:02:24,064 --> 00:02:27,555
I've been striving to make fungi
into a functional drink of choice...

12
00:02:27,555 --> 00:02:28,772
Mushroom coffee.

13
00:02:31,745 --> 00:02:33,351
With limited...

14
00:02:34,233 --> 00:02:35,640
limited...

15
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:38,568
limited...

16
00:02:39,343 --> 00:02:40,587
success.

17
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:46,984
But today, day 243,

18
00:02:46,984 --> 00:02:50,272
has brought a new optimism
to my most pressing endeavor...

19
00:02:50,711 --> 00:02:55,250
planetus exodus to returnicus
and kick blue butticus.

20
00:03:02,105 --> 00:03:03,855
If my calculations are correct,

21
00:03:03,857 --> 00:03:06,593
and there's no reason to say "if"
because they always are...

22
00:03:07,971 --> 00:03:11,763
this quill is going to power
my masterpiece.

23
00:03:14,064 --> 00:03:15,439
Let's light this candle...

24
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,867
and see who comes a-knockin'.

25
00:04:25,775 --> 00:04:26,983
Greetings!

26
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,775
Klaatu barada nikto.

27
00:04:45,268 --> 00:04:47,339
Agent Stone?
Now!

28
00:04:57,665 --> 00:04:59,009
Thank you, Stone.

29
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:05,212
It's time to say goodbye
to this piece-of-shiitake planet!

30
00:05:30,212 --> 00:05:32,002
Where did you get that?

31
00:05:35,912 --> 00:05:38,861
From a little blue menace
on the planet called Earth.

32
00:05:41,147 --> 00:05:43,355
I'd be happy to show you the way.

33
00:06:18,206 --> 00:06:19,457
They're still on us.

34
00:06:20,347 --> 00:06:21,514
This'll slow 'em down.

35
00:06:48,337 --> 00:06:51,109
Watch out. Excuse me.
Pardon me. Coming through.

36
00:06:52,177 --> 00:06:54,571
Good evening, gentlemen.
Mind if I drive?

37
00:06:56,318 --> 00:06:57,693
Better buckle up.

38
00:07:05,612 --> 00:07:07,250
How we doing back there?

39
00:07:08,272 --> 00:07:09,863
And now this way.

40
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:21,868
I'm sorry.
I don't speak duct tape.

41
00:07:22,064 --> 00:07:24,522
- What the heck are you?
- Fear not, citizen.

42
00:07:24,524 --> 00:07:28,603
I am the hero you need
and the hero you deserve.

43
00:07:28,689 --> 00:07:31,147
The blue dawn that banishes the darkest...

44
00:07:31,206 --> 00:07:32,373
Holy crap!

45
00:07:36,628 --> 00:07:39,611
Don't worry.
Nobody's gonna get hurt.

46
00:07:44,517 --> 00:07:46,030
- What are those?
- Bombs. Bombs.

47
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:47,655
They're bombs!
Those are bombs!

48
00:07:47,655 --> 00:07:49,866
Relax. They're not even lit.

49
00:07:49,866 --> 00:07:53,061
So I'll say again, nobody's gonna get...

50
00:07:54,439 --> 00:07:56,506
I was wrong!
We're all gonna die!

51
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:00,569
Why aren't you slowing down?

52
00:08:00,569 --> 00:08:02,530
That would require brakes.

53
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:07,153
It's hot. Hot, hot, hot!
Hot, hot, hot!

54
00:08:07,155 --> 00:08:08,605
Why don't you just let
the police handle this?

55
00:08:08,607 --> 00:08:12,139
Because that's not what heroes do.

56
00:08:14,564 --> 00:08:18,194
Thank you very much.
Please hold your applause.

57
00:08:21,862 --> 00:08:24,561
Do you hear that?
There's one bomb left.

58
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:30,225
- Did you check under the seat?
- Of course I checked under the seat!

59
00:08:31,772 --> 00:08:33,439
You are terrible at this!

60
00:08:33,448 --> 00:08:34,128
You know what?

61
00:08:34,128 --> 00:08:36,769
Your negative attitude
is not helping anyone.

62
00:08:37,045 --> 00:08:38,819
It's in your spiky things!

63
00:08:40,321 --> 00:08:42,538
I can never find anything in here.

64
00:08:43,811 --> 00:08:46,105
Drained it from downtown!

65
00:08:47,197 --> 00:08:50,194
See? I told you
nobody would get hurt.

66
00:08:52,612 --> 00:08:54,538
Holy sherbet!

67
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:57,710
Oh, hello.

68
00:08:57,710 --> 00:09:00,530
Don't panic.
This is only a drill.

69
00:09:43,013 --> 00:09:46,305
- Come here!
- No need to thank me, citizens.

70
00:09:46,397 --> 00:09:49,022
All in a night's work for...

71
00:09:49,315 --> 00:09:51,274
Blue Justice!

72
00:09:52,264 --> 00:09:54,194
You're a terrible hero!

73
00:10:05,943 --> 00:10:08,514
- Morning, Wade!
- Morning, Sonic!

74
00:10:15,444 --> 00:10:18,842
Good morning, Green Hills!

75
00:10:37,336 --> 00:10:38,419
Come on.

76
00:11:01,517 --> 00:11:02,517
Sonic.

77
00:11:03,002 --> 00:11:04,908
I miss you, Longclaw.

78
00:11:05,412 --> 00:11:07,259
I'm trying to make you proud.

79
00:11:16,292 --> 00:11:20,043
And now for a little shut-eye.

80
00:11:24,248 --> 00:11:25,956
Ozzy, morning breath!

81
00:11:25,981 --> 00:11:28,300
Sonic. Are you still in bed?

82
00:11:28,485 --> 00:11:30,793
You're supposed to meet Tom, remember?

83
00:11:32,527 --> 00:11:36,152
All right, all right, I'm up!
I'm up.

84
00:11:37,587 --> 00:11:38,878
What a day.

85
00:11:41,418 --> 00:11:43,113
Thanks for coming out, bud.

86
00:11:43,909 --> 00:11:46,946
I feel like you and me,
we haven't had much time together lately.

87
00:11:49,605 --> 00:11:51,647
How's it going over there?
You getting any bites?

88
00:11:59,564 --> 00:12:01,147
I can't swim!
Help!

89
00:12:01,156 --> 00:12:03,410
If I die, don't look in my closet!

90
00:12:03,412 --> 00:12:06,079
Hey, hey, you're good.
You're all right. Come on.

91
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:09,707
- It's freezing.
- All right, okay. Take it easy.

92
00:12:11,314 --> 00:12:13,574
You're good. Okay.

93
00:12:17,022 --> 00:12:19,897
But now that you've had a nap and a bath...

94
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:24,996
I went up to your room last night
to bring you some new comics and...

95
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,121
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Stop right there.

96
00:12:30,121 --> 00:12:31,241
I wouldn't come any closer,

97
00:12:31,241 --> 00:12:34,439
because this little hedgehog
had way too many chili dogs.

98
00:12:34,441 --> 00:12:35,912
Oh, no. Oh, no.

99
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:38,728
I'm so embarrassed.
Get out of here quick!

100
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:40,644
Oh, no, here comes another one!

101
00:12:41,064 --> 00:12:43,147
Go. Now. Save yourself.

102
00:12:43,149 --> 00:12:44,587
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Stop right there.

103
00:12:44,587 --> 00:12:45,939
I wouldn't come any closer,

104
00:12:45,941 --> 00:12:49,092
because this little hedgehog
had way too many chili dogs.

105
00:12:49,092 --> 00:12:50,488
Oh, no. Oh, no.

106
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:53,199
I'm so embarrassed.
Get out of here...

107
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:55,371
I knew I should've used real farts.

108
00:12:58,272 --> 00:12:59,988
- How many times are we gonna do this?
- What?

109
00:12:59,995 --> 00:13:02,652
Cast your line and not catch anything?
Seems like a billion.

110
00:13:02,652 --> 00:13:04,355
I think you know what I'm talking about.

111
00:13:04,947 --> 00:13:07,447
The lying.
The sneaking out.

112
00:13:07,506 --> 00:13:09,035
The pretending to be Batman.

113
00:13:09,035 --> 00:13:12,035
- Blue Justice, trademark pending.
- Whatever. You're being reckless.

114
00:13:12,605 --> 00:13:14,064
Not this conversation again.

115
00:13:14,137 --> 00:13:16,027
Hey. It's no fun for me, either.

116
00:13:16,034 --> 00:13:18,519
But if you keep being irresponsible,
we're gonna keep having this conversation.

117
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:21,050
How is it irresponsible to use my powers?

118
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:24,022
Sonic, you destroyed an entire city block!

119
00:13:24,024 --> 00:13:26,941
That block was already messed up.
Who cares?

120
00:13:26,943 --> 00:13:30,621
Look, I stopped a robbery.
I was a hero.

121
00:13:30,621 --> 00:13:33,933
No, you put people in danger
and that's not what a hero does.

122
00:13:37,022 --> 00:13:39,199
You're supposed to be my friend.

123
00:13:39,238 --> 00:13:40,925
Stop trying to be my dad.

124
00:13:45,793 --> 00:13:47,529
I can take care of myself.

125
00:13:47,605 --> 00:13:52,189
Sonic, taking care of yourself
is not what being a hero's all about.

126
00:13:52,342 --> 00:13:54,707
It's about taking responsibility
for other people.

127
00:13:55,689 --> 00:13:59,207
And right now, whether you want to hear
this or not, you are still just a kid.

128
00:13:59,689 --> 00:14:03,189
You got some more growing up to do
before you're ready to be the big hero.

129
00:14:04,228 --> 00:14:05,728
But trust me when I tell you,

130
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:08,277
there will come a time
when your powers will be needed.

131
00:14:10,332 --> 00:14:12,496
But you don't choose that moment.

132
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:14,793
That moment chooses you.

133
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:17,772
Look at you.

134
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:20,433
Look at that.
I just got goose bumps.

135
00:14:20,689 --> 00:14:22,439
Wait a second.
Did you steal that from Oprah?

136
00:14:22,441 --> 00:14:25,300
No, sir.
That is a Wachowski family special.

137
00:14:25,647 --> 00:14:29,886
Came from my dad,
in this very boat, on this very lake.

138
00:14:30,897 --> 00:14:33,503
He would always try and steer me
in the right direction.

139
00:14:34,269 --> 00:14:36,621
And that's what Maddie and
I have always tried to do with you.

140
00:14:37,522 --> 00:14:40,902
So, until your moment arrives,

141
00:14:41,709 --> 00:14:44,126
I want you to work on
being a little more responsible.

142
00:14:45,647 --> 00:14:46,730
Comprende?

143
00:14:47,564 --> 00:14:48,814
Comprende.

144
00:14:49,564 --> 00:14:50,897
High five on it.

145
00:14:51,634 --> 00:14:55,316
Yeah! Donut Lord and the Blue Blur
are back at it again!

146
00:14:55,316 --> 00:14:56,355
Hang on.

147
00:14:57,089 --> 00:14:58,066
Speedboat!

148
00:15:02,232 --> 00:15:03,503
Sonic!

149
00:15:05,562 --> 00:15:09,312
How excited are you,
going to Hawaii with me?

150
00:15:09,314 --> 00:15:10,683
Oh, yeah!

151
00:15:13,831 --> 00:15:17,318
Welcome to Sonic Air,
the fastest way to travel.

152
00:15:17,355 --> 00:15:19,378
Now boarding groups one and two.

153
00:15:21,272 --> 00:15:23,788
Sonic, this is so fun!

154
00:15:23,788 --> 00:15:26,613
I'm sorry, ma'am, you're group three.
Please wait your turn.

155
00:15:26,613 --> 00:15:29,894
- Anyone from groups one and two? Nobody?
- Just let him get it out of his system.

156
00:15:29,894 --> 00:15:32,402
Okay, then everybody else right this way.

157
00:15:32,647 --> 00:15:33,772
Thank you.

158
00:15:38,689 --> 00:15:39,814
And you, sir?

159
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,980
Terrible shirt detected.

160
00:15:43,064 --> 00:15:44,064
There we go.

161
00:15:44,334 --> 00:15:48,152
Okay, you're free to go. Enjoy your trip.
Bye-bye now.

162
00:15:48,439 --> 00:15:49,439
Okay.

163
00:15:50,667 --> 00:15:51,527
Bring it in.

164
00:15:51,527 --> 00:15:54,605
Tom, I'm about to be
hedgehog of the house for the first time.

165
00:15:54,689 --> 00:15:57,394
I think I'm a little mature
to hug you goodbye.

166
00:15:57,394 --> 00:15:59,038
Okay, what about a power bump?

167
00:15:59,522 --> 00:16:01,397
- Power bump?
- Yes, power bump.

168
00:16:01,425 --> 00:16:02,685
That's more like it.

169
00:16:02,972 --> 00:16:04,808
- Wachowski!
- Wachowski!

170
00:16:05,022 --> 00:16:07,566
Okay, use this one to get back home.

171
00:16:09,141 --> 00:16:11,502
All right, we're off.
Be good.

172
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:13,511
Yes.
You have our number.

173
00:16:13,511 --> 00:16:14,738
Sorry! Can't hear you!

174
00:16:14,738 --> 00:16:16,509
You're traveling through a
cross-dimensional portal!

175
00:16:16,511 --> 00:16:17,926
- Miss you already!
- Okay?

176
00:16:17,926 --> 00:16:19,761
Have fun at Rachel's wedding!

177
00:16:21,358 --> 00:16:23,598
Okay, it's 48 hours until they come back.

178
00:16:23,598 --> 00:16:27,714
We've got TV channels, streaming channels,
a house full of food and no supervision.

179
00:16:28,939 --> 00:16:30,022
Let's do this.

180
00:17:58,126 --> 00:18:00,667
If these readings are accurate, he's here.

181
00:18:00,781 --> 00:18:01,906
I found him!

182
00:18:02,186 --> 00:18:04,311
I just hope I'm not too late.

183
00:18:22,704 --> 00:18:23,728
He's close.

184
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:26,194
I just need a way to reach him
without being spotted.

185
00:18:28,363 --> 00:18:30,936
Standard human transport.
Perfect.

186
00:18:43,225 --> 00:18:44,460
Oh, boy.

187
00:18:48,996 --> 00:18:51,092
Aloha!

188
00:18:51,374 --> 00:18:53,530
- How's it going, bud?
- Oh, you know.

189
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:56,397
Just a quiet night at home,
settling in with a good book.

190
00:18:56,407 --> 00:18:59,366
- And you? What's up with you?
- I was just calling to say we're here.

191
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:02,655
But now every word out of your mouth
is making me suspicious.

192
00:19:02,655 --> 00:19:03,295
What?

193
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:07,230
You got to relax, buddy.
You're at the Four Seasons Oahu.

194
00:19:07,239 --> 00:19:09,764
Have a mai tai.
Enjoy some time with your wife.

195
00:19:09,814 --> 00:19:11,975
Get sunburned somewhere embarrassing.

196
00:19:12,056 --> 00:19:14,228
This weekend is about you.

197
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:17,085
You know what? You're right.
We power-bumped on it.

198
00:19:17,085 --> 00:19:18,374
So whatever it is you're doing,

199
00:19:18,374 --> 00:19:20,897
I'm sure you can undo it
by the time we get home, yeah?

200
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:25,874
Exactly! I mean, I am deeply offended
by such accusations!

201
00:19:25,881 --> 00:19:27,404
So, how's Rachel's fiance?

202
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:30,564
Is he as good-looking in person
as he is in pictures?

203
00:19:32,564 --> 00:19:33,881
Somehow better-looking.

204
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:37,428
Wow! You're about to be
the third best-looking dude in the family.

205
00:19:37,428 --> 00:19:39,444
But, hey, still on the podium.

206
00:19:40,397 --> 00:19:43,045
All right,
I better go and introduce myself.

207
00:19:43,842 --> 00:19:44,944
Stay out of trouble.

208
00:19:44,944 --> 00:19:49,154
Trouble? Don't worry.
Everything here is completely normal.

209
00:19:49,156 --> 00:19:50,913
Uh-huh. Night, bud.

210
00:19:51,975 --> 00:19:53,741
Hey! I was just
coming over to say hi.

211
00:19:53,749 --> 00:19:56,795
You've got a lot of nerve coming up
in here after what you did to my fiancee.

212
00:19:57,814 --> 00:19:59,827
- Wait. What?
- Totaling her car?

213
00:20:00,189 --> 00:20:02,772
Leaving her tied to a chair?
I should rip you limb from limb.

214
00:20:06,904 --> 00:20:08,423
Oh, my God, look at your face!

215
00:20:08,423 --> 00:20:10,977
Tommy, breathe, baby. Breathe.
I was kidding.

216
00:20:10,977 --> 00:20:13,286
- Hey, man, I was totally kidding.
- Okay.

217
00:20:14,564 --> 00:20:16,272
- You were kidding.
- Yeah.

218
00:20:16,355 --> 00:20:19,415
I'm sorry. Rachel put me up to it.
It was totally her idea.

219
00:20:20,016 --> 00:20:21,313
That rascal.

220
00:20:21,313 --> 00:20:25,829
Listen, I don't know if you're aware.
Rachel does not care for you at all.

221
00:20:26,147 --> 00:20:27,587
I'm aware. Yeah.

222
00:20:27,991 --> 00:20:30,116
Seriously, bro, you got work to do.

223
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:31,696
- Hey!
- Hey.

224
00:20:31,696 --> 00:20:34,064
Good to see you!
Thanks for coming, Tom.

225
00:20:34,147 --> 00:20:36,313
- Really glad you came.
- Really?

226
00:20:38,108 --> 00:20:40,063
Great to see you, too.
Congratulations.

227
00:20:40,065 --> 00:20:42,732
I mean, you guys, you guys
seem really happy together.

228
00:20:42,814 --> 00:20:44,805
You know, you're all right,
Thomas Wachowski.

229
00:20:46,355 --> 00:20:49,048
- Can we bury the hatchet?
- I'd love that.

230
00:20:49,048 --> 00:20:50,048
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

231
00:20:50,055 --> 00:20:52,907
- All right, bring it in!
- All right! Great.

232
00:20:53,578 --> 00:20:56,376
And if you screw up my wedding,
I will end you.

233
00:21:00,353 --> 00:21:03,219
All right, Ozzy,
it's movie night at Casa de Sonic,

234
00:21:03,227 --> 00:21:04,529
and it's your turn to pick.

235
00:21:04,605 --> 00:21:07,147
But I am not watching Snow Dogs again.

236
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:10,118
That movie is the worst!

237
00:21:12,897 --> 00:21:14,105
Blackout!

238
00:21:15,469 --> 00:21:17,821
Ozzy.

239
00:21:18,355 --> 00:21:20,243
Sorry, buddy.
Everything's okay.

240
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:30,561
Excuse me.
We did not order a poltergeist.

241
00:21:40,389 --> 00:21:44,194
If this is the pizza guy,
this is really unprofessional.

242
00:22:02,038 --> 00:22:03,288
Eggman?

243
00:22:06,564 --> 00:22:09,795
Hello, hedgehog.

244
00:22:10,772 --> 00:22:12,064
Did you miss me?

245
00:22:13,439 --> 00:22:17,999
I don't know how you got back,
but you made a big mistake coming here.

246
00:22:17,999 --> 00:22:20,960
Au contraire, mon frere.

247
00:22:21,217 --> 00:22:23,675
The mistake was thinking you'd won.

248
00:22:23,814 --> 00:22:26,314
But that was just a prelude,
an hors d'oeuvre,

249
00:22:26,316 --> 00:22:28,749
an aperitif, an amuse-bouche.

250
00:22:28,749 --> 00:22:30,108
I get it.

251
00:22:31,564 --> 00:22:33,483
I don't think you do.

252
00:22:33,483 --> 00:22:35,071
But you're about to.

253
00:22:35,147 --> 00:22:37,842
And so will that idiot sheriff
and his wife.

254
00:22:40,225 --> 00:22:42,059
And your little dog too!

255
00:23:00,987 --> 00:23:02,154
Pitiful.

256
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:05,241
What? Who are you?

257
00:23:06,204 --> 00:23:09,553
Where are my manners?

258
00:23:09,772 --> 00:23:13,147
Sonic, meet Knuckles.

259
00:23:13,149 --> 00:23:15,444
My new BFFAE.

260
00:23:15,444 --> 00:23:18,897
Bestest friend forever and ever!

261
00:23:18,988 --> 00:23:22,113
Look, Robotnik, I don't care
who you brought to help you.

262
00:23:22,115 --> 00:23:24,045
You're never going to get my power.

263
00:23:24,105 --> 00:23:27,077
Do I look like I need your power?

264
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:41,707
So nice when diabolical evil
lives up to the hype.

265
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,066
Where is it?

266
00:23:46,347 --> 00:23:49,324
You want it?
Here it comes.

267
00:23:49,324 --> 00:23:54,363
I was expecting more of you.
You're unskilled.

268
00:23:54,748 --> 00:23:56,217
Untrained.

269
00:23:57,220 --> 00:24:00,035
And unworthy!

270
00:24:01,566 --> 00:24:04,777
You forgot one.
Unstoppable.

271
00:24:30,728 --> 00:24:34,541
It is my destiny
to do what my ancestors could not...

272
00:24:34,541 --> 00:24:38,689
to restore the ultimate power
to the home of my people.

273
00:24:39,674 --> 00:24:43,174
Ultimate power?
I don't know what you're talking about.

274
00:24:43,314 --> 00:24:44,884
You've got the wrong guy.

275
00:24:44,899 --> 00:24:46,939
Ultimate power?

276
00:24:47,272 --> 00:24:50,064
Now you're speaking my language.

277
00:24:50,066 --> 00:24:53,314
Don't play dumb with me,
apprentice of Longclaw.

278
00:24:53,405 --> 00:24:54,863
You knew Longclaw?

279
00:24:54,865 --> 00:24:59,267
Longclaw and her people were
the sworn enemy of my tribe, the Echidna.

280
00:24:59,269 --> 00:25:04,423
We fought and died at their hands,
and now you will die at mine.

281
00:25:14,936 --> 00:25:16,996
Come on. Get in!
I'm on your side.

282
00:25:16,996 --> 00:25:19,022
I'm sorry. Who are you?

283
00:25:20,084 --> 00:25:22,214
You know what?
It doesn't matter.

284
00:25:24,766 --> 00:25:26,972
Get us out of here!
Go, go, go, go, go!

285
00:25:30,967 --> 00:25:32,170
He's gone rabid!

286
00:25:33,967 --> 00:25:35,835
Gross! Is he licking it?

287
00:25:36,647 --> 00:25:37,860
See ya!

288
00:25:37,982 --> 00:25:40,506
Make sure to get your shots, Eggman!

289
00:25:54,189 --> 00:25:57,897
Wow. Okay. Let me just say
it is an honor to finally meet you, Sonic.

290
00:25:57,899 --> 00:25:59,441
Is it okay if I call you Sonic?

291
00:25:59,443 --> 00:26:02,400
Everyone calls me Tails.
You're probably wondering why.

292
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,762
Let me guess.
Because of the extra tail?

293
00:26:04,777 --> 00:26:06,970
That's right!
I should've known you'd get that.

294
00:26:06,994 --> 00:26:10,752
Cool. Also, what is going on?
Robotnik's back?

295
00:26:10,752 --> 00:26:13,720
And who is
Clifford the Big Red Rage Monster?

296
00:26:13,722 --> 00:26:15,798
That's Knuckles, the last of the Echidnas

297
00:26:15,798 --> 00:26:18,384
and the most dangerous warrior
in the galaxy.

298
00:26:18,431 --> 00:26:20,681
He's obsessed with finding
the Master Emerald.

299
00:26:20,681 --> 00:26:22,855
Are you serious?
The Master Emerald?

300
00:26:22,946 --> 00:26:24,728
That's just a bedtime story.

301
00:26:24,728 --> 00:26:26,267
Well, he believes it's real.

302
00:26:26,298 --> 00:26:28,908
And he must think
you're the key to finding it.

303
00:26:30,728 --> 00:26:32,480
Red light!
Give me the wheel!

304
00:26:32,482 --> 00:26:34,583
- Hey, what are you...
- Move your foot.

305
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:43,564
I think we lost him.

306
00:26:51,342 --> 00:26:54,181
We did not lose him.
We definitely did not lose him!

307
00:26:59,462 --> 00:27:01,397
I've got an idea.
Do you trust me?

308
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:03,861
Of course not!
I literally just met you!

309
00:27:03,861 --> 00:27:05,855
- Just let me. Come on!
- What are you doing?

310
00:27:24,886 --> 00:27:26,136
We're flying.

311
00:27:26,822 --> 00:27:29,214
Did your butt just turn into a helicopter?

312
00:27:30,178 --> 00:27:32,011
A butt-copter!

313
00:27:32,542 --> 00:27:35,876
Only Sonic the Hedgehog
could come up with something like that.

314
00:27:51,059 --> 00:27:53,410
Foxy move.

315
00:27:54,314 --> 00:27:56,355
You want something done right...

316
00:27:57,709 --> 00:28:00,933
you have to hire someone
you can push around.

317
00:28:02,855 --> 00:28:03,855
All caps.

318
00:28:22,064 --> 00:28:25,791
Doctor, where are you?

319
00:28:32,494 --> 00:28:33,627
Freak.

320
00:28:41,475 --> 00:28:43,553
I, I'm sorry, folks.

321
00:28:43,561 --> 00:28:46,280
I have to close early.
Everybody out!

322
00:28:46,478 --> 00:28:49,520
Everybody out.
Thank you for visiting the Mean Bean.

323
00:28:49,522 --> 00:28:51,720
All right, good night.
Good night.

324
00:29:10,824 --> 00:29:12,152
He's back.

325
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,839
He's back!

326
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:12,631
That's more like it.

327
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:16,483
I've been re-hatched!

328
00:30:28,136 --> 00:30:32,370
So, my massively metacarpaled friend,

329
00:30:32,379 --> 00:30:33,355
you mentioned...

330
00:30:33,355 --> 00:30:37,697
ultimate power.

331
00:30:37,853 --> 00:30:39,003
Back at the house?

332
00:30:39,269 --> 00:30:40,707
The Master Emerald?

333
00:30:40,707 --> 00:30:41,946
It does not concern you.

334
00:30:42,029 --> 00:30:45,029
I got you off that planet
and you brought me to the hedgehog.

335
00:30:45,174 --> 00:30:47,299
We have no more use for each other.

336
00:30:47,314 --> 00:30:49,996
Well, I hate to be a contrarian, but...

337
00:30:50,564 --> 00:30:51,689
I think we might.

338
00:30:53,308 --> 00:30:55,646
You think these machines
are a match for me?

339
00:30:55,722 --> 00:30:59,589
I will shatter them
like the bones from a fallen...

340
00:31:00,064 --> 00:31:01,457
They are stairs.

341
00:31:06,889 --> 00:31:11,433
You see, Earth is my turf, G.

342
00:31:11,564 --> 00:31:14,314
If you don't know how to floss,
you'll be lost without me.

343
00:31:14,316 --> 00:31:17,261
I understand nothing
of what you just said.

344
00:31:17,268 --> 00:31:21,537
I help you retrieve the Emerald,
and you use it to...

345
00:31:22,681 --> 00:31:28,363
destroy the hedgehog!

346
00:31:28,365 --> 00:31:30,480
You're suggesting an alliance.

347
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:34,543
Around here we simply
grip each other's hands tightly.

348
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:43,574
You truculent space bumpkin!

349
00:31:43,574 --> 00:31:46,113
You've crushed my favorite hand!

350
00:31:46,272 --> 00:31:48,535
Really?
My hand is uninjured.

351
00:31:49,605 --> 00:31:51,996
But I'm now convinced of your commitment.

352
00:31:51,996 --> 00:31:53,647
"Oh, goody,"

353
00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:57,230
he exclaimed,
while he reset two of his knuckles.

354
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,511
I'm...

355
00:31:59,722 --> 00:32:05,128
delighted to be on the same team.

356
00:32:12,643 --> 00:32:13,935
Road trip!

357
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,522
I'll let you stick your nose
out the window.

358
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:20,480
Sonic, where are we?

359
00:32:20,645 --> 00:32:23,020
Welcome to the Wade Cave.

360
00:32:23,022 --> 00:32:26,064
Which is something
I hope to someday say to a woman.

361
00:32:26,147 --> 00:32:27,814
A woman who's not my mom.

362
00:32:28,222 --> 00:32:29,937
Wade, focus.

363
00:32:29,939 --> 00:32:33,647
We need to figure out why Knuckles thinks
I'm the key to finding the Master Emerald.

364
00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:35,647
And why did he mention Longclaw?

365
00:32:36,511 --> 00:32:38,902
There must be a connection.

366
00:32:39,073 --> 00:32:40,480
Wait a minute.
There is.

367
00:32:41,022 --> 00:32:44,939
Look. There's an emerald symbol
on the map Longclaw gave me.

368
00:32:45,019 --> 00:32:46,897
I never knew what it meant before.

369
00:32:47,605 --> 00:32:49,272
Something's happening.

370
00:33:02,454 --> 00:33:03,829
Longclaw?

371
00:33:03,831 --> 00:33:05,373
Hello, Sonic.

372
00:33:05,529 --> 00:33:08,904
If you're watching this,
then something has happened to me.

373
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:11,814
And I pray
you've made it to Earth unharmed.

374
00:33:12,396 --> 00:33:16,687
This world has been chosen
for a very important reason.

375
00:33:16,689 --> 00:33:20,845
It's the secret location
of the Master Emerald.

376
00:33:22,439 --> 00:33:26,486
The Emerald has the power
to turn thoughts into reality.

377
00:33:26,908 --> 00:33:29,877
Like the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man
from Ghostbusters.

378
00:33:29,884 --> 00:33:33,946
In the wrong hands it could threaten
all life in the universe.

379
00:33:34,022 --> 00:33:36,939
Protecting the Emerald was my sacred duty.

380
00:33:37,022 --> 00:33:40,994
And now I must pass
that responsibility to you.

381
00:33:41,814 --> 00:33:44,480
This is my moment.

382
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:48,517
Follow the map, find the Emerald,
and keep it safe.

383
00:33:48,647 --> 00:33:50,189
My dear Sonic,

384
00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:53,556
you have a heart
like no creature I've ever known.

385
00:33:53,863 --> 00:33:55,595
I love you so much.

386
00:33:57,181 --> 00:33:58,397
Goodbye.

387
00:34:00,087 --> 00:34:01,853
No, no, no, wait.

388
00:34:08,689 --> 00:34:10,869
I won't let you down, Longclaw.

389
00:34:12,603 --> 00:34:15,770
So is that you, your dad?

390
00:34:15,772 --> 00:34:16,970
What?

391
00:34:17,314 --> 00:34:18,314
No?

392
00:34:19,064 --> 00:34:22,212
According to this map,
the first clue is in Siberia.

393
00:34:22,212 --> 00:34:24,353
It's a compass
that will lead to the Emerald.

394
00:34:24,436 --> 00:34:27,353
And with Knuckles already here,
it's a race.

395
00:34:27,355 --> 00:34:28,650
Knuckles?

396
00:34:29,105 --> 00:34:30,884
I knew a kid in middle school
named Knuckles.

397
00:34:30,884 --> 00:34:32,814
Could fit his whole fist in his mouth.

398
00:34:33,072 --> 00:34:36,904
If this is the same Knuckles,
we are screwed.

399
00:34:36,906 --> 00:34:39,470
This Knuckles, that Knuckles.
It doesn't matter.

400
00:34:39,535 --> 00:34:41,202
We're gonna get there first.

401
00:34:44,272 --> 00:34:46,275
What do you mean, "we"?

402
00:34:46,275 --> 00:34:47,283
You're coming with me.

403
00:34:47,830 --> 00:34:48,782
No, no, no, no, no.

404
00:34:48,897 --> 00:34:52,267
I just came here to warn you.
I'm not a field guy.

405
00:34:52,267 --> 00:34:56,353
Don't worry. I got your back.
I won't let anything happen to you.

406
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:01,697
It's a power bump.
On Earth, it means an unbreakable promise.

407
00:35:01,704 --> 00:35:04,353
Okay, I'm in.

408
00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:22,410
Doctor. It's really you.

409
00:35:23,022 --> 00:35:24,816
You look different.

410
00:35:25,189 --> 00:35:28,158
Papa's got a brand new 'stache.

411
00:35:31,062 --> 00:35:34,687
I knew it. I knew it!
I knew you'd come back, sir.

412
00:35:34,689 --> 00:35:37,394
I never stopped steaming
your Austrian goat's milk.

413
00:35:43,064 --> 00:35:44,397
Could use some mushroom.

414
00:35:46,272 --> 00:35:47,744
You brought something.

415
00:35:48,204 --> 00:35:51,173
Some kind of space porcupine.

416
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:54,480
Porcupine?
I am an Echidna!

417
00:35:54,564 --> 00:35:57,314
Trained since birth
in all forms of lethal combat,

418
00:35:57,314 --> 00:35:59,627
destined to restore honor to my tribe,

419
00:35:59,627 --> 00:36:03,447
and willing to destroy
anything that gets in my way.

420
00:36:03,939 --> 00:36:05,314
Welcome to the team.

421
00:36:11,522 --> 00:36:13,858
That means he trusts you, Stone.

422
00:36:14,064 --> 00:36:17,014
Now let's renovate this dump!

423
00:36:17,439 --> 00:36:19,944
Latte with steamed Austrian goat milk!

424
00:36:40,105 --> 00:36:41,589
Good one. Solid.

425
00:36:48,564 --> 00:36:50,316
- Sorry, fellas.
- That's game!

426
00:36:51,021 --> 00:36:53,027
That's how we do!
That's how we do!

427
00:36:53,029 --> 00:36:56,183
- But are they good at math?
- Teamwork makes the dream work!

428
00:36:56,230 --> 00:36:58,003
Sorry about that, Big Tom.

429
00:36:58,197 --> 00:37:00,097
- Are you good?
- All good. Fine.

430
00:37:00,105 --> 00:37:03,480
Hey. Thanks for inviting me out to hang
with you and your groomsmen.

431
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:05,433
Good quality bonding.

432
00:37:05,435 --> 00:37:06,837
You know, bro,

433
00:37:06,855 --> 00:37:09,355
those guys right there,
they're way more than my groomsmen.

434
00:37:09,439 --> 00:37:10,800
That's my squad.

435
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,605
Never would've made it through life
without 'em.

436
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:13,814
Get over here!

437
00:37:13,889 --> 00:37:15,714
Yeah, I'm coming! I'm coming!

438
00:37:16,266 --> 00:37:19,253
- I'll catch you later.
- Hey. Yeah!

439
00:37:19,253 --> 00:37:21,566
Let me know if you're ready
for some power yoga.

440
00:37:21,566 --> 00:37:23,717
- You bet.
- Come on, Tommy boy. Let's go.

441
00:37:23,717 --> 00:37:24,376
Let's go.

442
00:37:24,378 --> 00:37:25,522
Don't make me.

443
00:37:26,605 --> 00:37:27,689
What am I doing?

444
00:37:27,691 --> 00:37:28,983
Hey, Uncle Tommy!

445
00:37:29,147 --> 00:37:30,863
Hey, girls!

446
00:37:30,863 --> 00:37:32,073
How you do.

447
00:37:32,207 --> 00:37:34,073
- Are those the wedding rings?
- Uh-huh.

448
00:37:34,073 --> 00:37:35,003
May I?

449
00:37:35,003 --> 00:37:38,788
This little ring bearer
has been taking her job very seriously.

450
00:37:38,795 --> 00:37:41,191
- She's been practicing all morning.
- I can see that.

451
00:37:41,193 --> 00:37:43,480
How very responsible of you.

452
00:37:43,482 --> 00:37:45,394
Except aren't there supposed
to be two wedding rings?

453
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:47,105
Uh-oh.

454
00:37:48,346 --> 00:37:52,222
- Uncle Tommy?
- Hang on. What's going on here?

455
00:37:54,189 --> 00:37:55,621
You're gonna do great, kiddo.

456
00:37:55,628 --> 00:37:56,530
Bye.

457
00:37:56,532 --> 00:37:58,128
- Hey, baby.
- Hi.

458
00:38:01,097 --> 00:38:03,503
That's right!
Groom in the building!

459
00:38:03,503 --> 00:38:05,011
Look at those guys.

460
00:38:05,237 --> 00:38:07,043
I wish Sonic had that.

461
00:38:07,189 --> 00:38:09,621
- Muscles?
- Control yourself.

462
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:14,105
No. Buddies.
Wingmen. A squad.

463
00:38:14,339 --> 00:38:18,019
Sonic doesn't have anything like that.
He's flying solo.

464
00:38:18,652 --> 00:38:20,949
Baby, you got to relax.

465
00:38:20,949 --> 00:38:22,722
You're at the Four Seasons.

466
00:38:22,722 --> 00:38:26,308
Have a mai tai.
Spend some time with your wife.

467
00:38:26,308 --> 00:38:29,332
That's what he said.
Seriously, his exact words.

468
00:38:29,332 --> 00:38:33,347
See? He's a smart kid.
He'll find his way.

469
00:38:33,738 --> 00:38:36,746
I absolutely cannot find my way.

470
00:38:36,746 --> 00:38:40,535
We are completely, totally,
unequivocally lost.

471
00:38:41,673 --> 00:38:43,228
Sonic, in this weather,

472
00:38:43,228 --> 00:38:46,089
there's no way we're gonna get
any readings on this thing!

473
00:38:46,306 --> 00:38:48,199
- Should we go back?
- No, no, no.

474
00:38:48,199 --> 00:38:51,839
There's a light up ahead.
Maybe we can take shelter in there.

475
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:58,214
Perfect.

476
00:38:58,214 --> 00:39:01,321
Are you sure about this?
We don't know who's inside.

477
00:39:01,405 --> 00:39:04,655
Don't worry.
On Earth, people are very welcoming,

478
00:39:04,657 --> 00:39:08,410
and love taking complete strangers
into their homes.

479
00:39:38,381 --> 00:39:39,339
Run.

480
00:39:41,855 --> 00:39:43,439
Table for two, please!

481
00:39:45,645 --> 00:39:48,128
What would you like to order?

482
00:39:48,128 --> 00:39:49,832
Two beef stews, please.

483
00:39:54,947 --> 00:39:58,253
- Where'd you get all these cool gadgets?
- I invented 'em.

484
00:39:58,314 --> 00:40:00,230
That's kinda my thing.

485
00:40:00,314 --> 00:40:03,168
In fact,
my inventions are how I discovered you.

486
00:40:03,605 --> 00:40:06,285
Remember that night at the baseball field?

487
00:40:06,285 --> 00:40:09,730
Your energy blast reached all the way
to my home planet.

488
00:40:09,814 --> 00:40:14,439
I saw you save your whole village
from that crazy mustache guy.

489
00:40:14,529 --> 00:40:17,737
Wait, so you've been watching me
this whole time?

490
00:40:17,852 --> 00:40:19,435
Even in the shower?

491
00:40:19,808 --> 00:40:21,420
That's a trick question.

492
00:40:21,422 --> 00:40:23,832
Sonic the Hedgehog prefers bubble baths.

493
00:40:23,832 --> 00:40:25,253
Man, you're good!

494
00:40:25,253 --> 00:40:27,647
When I learned Knuckles was on your trail,

495
00:40:27,812 --> 00:40:30,687
I knew I couldn't just sit back
and watch anymore.

496
00:40:30,689 --> 00:40:32,425
I had to come warn you.

497
00:40:33,582 --> 00:40:35,363
What? Hang on one sec.

498
00:40:35,363 --> 00:40:36,933
Donut Lord is checking in.

499
00:40:38,821 --> 00:40:42,699
"Just chilling. Watching TV."

500
00:40:42,855 --> 00:40:44,766
Dot, dot, dot.

501
00:40:45,314 --> 00:40:47,439
Dot, dot, dot.

502
00:40:48,196 --> 00:40:50,213
Dot, dot, dot.

503
00:40:50,261 --> 00:40:52,113
Dot, dot, dot.

504
00:40:52,355 --> 00:40:54,939
Dot, dot, dot.

505
00:40:55,439 --> 00:40:56,439
Doctor,

506
00:40:57,439 --> 00:41:00,160
why are we working with this imbecile?

507
00:41:01,105 --> 00:41:06,050
Because that simpleminded space trash
is the key to something extraordinary.

508
00:41:06,605 --> 00:41:09,535
Something to help you get revenge
on the hedgehog.

509
00:41:09,647 --> 00:41:11,214
Think bigger, Stone.

510
00:41:11,439 --> 00:41:14,772
The emerald he seeks
could power my wildest designs.

511
00:41:14,855 --> 00:41:17,425
My genius wouldn't just
be recognized on Earth.

512
00:41:17,433 --> 00:41:20,433
It would spread virally
to every corner of the galaxy,

513
00:41:20,433 --> 00:41:24,043
allowing me to harness
all the negative forces of the universe

514
00:41:24,446 --> 00:41:26,696
and commune with Darkness itself.

515
00:41:26,772 --> 00:41:29,668
Wow. That sounds big.

516
00:41:29,814 --> 00:41:32,980
It's been on my vision board for years.
It's the Law of Attraction.

517
00:41:33,064 --> 00:41:34,543
Didn't you see The Secret?

518
00:41:35,730 --> 00:41:37,776
Kaplooey!

519
00:41:37,847 --> 00:41:38,889
Kaplooey.

520
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:42,363
"Another boring night at home."

521
00:41:42,363 --> 00:41:44,279
The hedgehog has returned home!

522
00:41:44,355 --> 00:41:47,988
Falsa.
Which is Latin for "wrong-o."

523
00:41:48,522 --> 00:41:53,050
According to my worldwide network
cell tower triangulation, he's lying,

524
00:41:53,439 --> 00:41:54,972
all the way

525
00:41:55,647 --> 00:41:59,996
from the majestic hinterlands
of Eastern Siberia.

526
00:42:00,655 --> 00:42:03,972
He's a long-distance liar!

527
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:10,777
Yeah, there's more where that came from.

528
00:42:12,814 --> 00:42:15,418
Tiny magic hedgehog destroyed.

529
00:42:16,272 --> 00:42:18,488
Now let's begin our quest.

530
00:42:21,189 --> 00:42:22,355
Wait.

531
00:42:22,493 --> 00:42:25,378
What about your minion?
The goat milker.

532
00:42:25,604 --> 00:42:27,937
There's no room on the ship for Stone.

533
00:42:27,939 --> 00:42:30,730
I say we ditch him,
ghost him, blow him off.

534
00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:32,160
Dishonor!

535
00:42:33,189 --> 00:42:36,246
"Dis" is how I roll.

536
00:42:44,238 --> 00:42:47,433
I'm sorry, but I asked for the beef stew.

537
00:42:47,511 --> 00:42:50,647
Your breath smells like goat poop.

538
00:42:51,381 --> 00:42:53,253
What did you say?

539
00:42:57,316 --> 00:42:58,730
What's going on?

540
00:42:59,355 --> 00:43:02,222
Maybe they think it's my birthday?

541
00:43:02,811 --> 00:43:06,353
Don't worry, I'll take care of this.
Okay, everybody, take it easy.

542
00:43:06,355 --> 00:43:08,397
I'm sure there's
a perfectly good explanation

543
00:43:08,399 --> 00:43:11,043
for whatever my friend said or did.

544
00:43:11,549 --> 00:43:12,646
Stand back.

545
00:43:12,855 --> 00:43:14,272
I just farted.

546
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:20,894
Meow?

547
00:43:20,894 --> 00:43:23,222
Throw these monsters in the fire!

548
00:43:26,897 --> 00:43:30,394
Oh, no, no. Come on, guys.
Take it easy. Let's talk this through.

549
00:43:30,565 --> 00:43:32,003
Let's talk this through!

550
00:43:33,238 --> 00:43:35,644
Come on, come on.
Scanning Siberian customs.

551
00:43:36,136 --> 00:43:39,522
- There's got to be something in here.
- Tails, whatever you're doing, do it fast.

552
00:43:39,714 --> 00:43:40,647
I think I got it!

553
00:43:40,730 --> 00:43:42,939
Pivonka!
Pivonka!

554
00:43:43,214 --> 00:43:45,527
Pivonka!

555
00:44:12,814 --> 00:44:13,814
Da.

556
00:44:14,355 --> 00:44:15,611
Pivonka!

557
00:44:17,189 --> 00:44:19,533
Tails, what's a "pivonka"?

558
00:44:19,533 --> 00:44:22,439
It's a Siberian custom
to resolve disputes.

559
00:44:22,439 --> 00:44:25,197
If we win, they let us go.
If we lose...

560
00:44:30,734 --> 00:44:32,616
Okay, we have to grab the
map and get out of here.

561
00:44:33,077 --> 00:44:33,937
Where's the map?

562
00:44:33,939 --> 00:44:36,831
Oh, no. I left it on the table!
Look!

563
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:45,605
What?

564
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:11,683
Oh, my God, it's a dance fight.

565
00:45:13,285 --> 00:45:15,064
Sonic, what do we do?

566
00:45:15,155 --> 00:45:17,785
We dance and get that map.

567
00:45:19,574 --> 00:45:20,683
Here we go.

568
00:45:23,081 --> 00:45:25,421
Okay, now let's do.
No, we're gonna go...

569
00:45:32,408 --> 00:45:33,697
Okay.

570
00:45:42,405 --> 00:45:46,447
Okay, this is not going well.
Channing Tatum makes it look so easy.

571
00:45:46,522 --> 00:45:48,267
Wait, Sonic. Look!

572
00:45:53,038 --> 00:45:55,249
The map!
Come on, let's grab it!

573
00:45:58,855 --> 00:46:00,381
You want?

574
00:46:00,647 --> 00:46:02,077
Come get.

575
00:46:02,835 --> 00:46:03,835
Freaks!

576
00:46:04,564 --> 00:46:06,014
Freaks!

577
00:46:06,014 --> 00:46:08,199
Freaks! Freaks! Freaks!

578
00:46:08,314 --> 00:46:10,480
Freaks! Freaks! Freaks!

579
00:46:10,482 --> 00:46:12,772
Freaks! Freaks! Freaks!

580
00:46:12,772 --> 00:46:14,403
Freaks! Freaks! Freaks!

581
00:46:14,405 --> 00:46:16,980
What's wrong, Tails?
Come on. I need you!

582
00:46:17,064 --> 00:46:19,980
I can't do this, Sonic.
I'm not brave like you.

583
00:46:20,064 --> 00:46:22,730
My gadget got us in this mess,
and I lost your map,

584
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:25,202
and we're gonna get tossed into a fire!

585
00:46:29,912 --> 00:46:31,827
New deejay coming in.

586
00:46:34,730 --> 00:46:36,730
Come on, pal.
I got an idea.

587
00:46:37,014 --> 00:46:38,858
They called us freaks,

588
00:46:39,452 --> 00:46:41,202
so let's get freaky.

589
00:46:41,655 --> 00:46:44,085
Just follow my moves.
You'll be fine.

590
00:47:12,112 --> 00:47:14,918
All right!
Backup dancers!

591
00:47:19,363 --> 00:47:20,597
Here we go!

592
00:47:41,834 --> 00:47:44,608
There's a lot of me up here!

593
00:47:49,689 --> 00:47:52,264
I love pivonka!

594
00:47:54,905 --> 00:47:58,710
And big dismount!

595
00:48:00,530 --> 00:48:01,350
Yeah!

596
00:48:05,189 --> 00:48:06,686
I'll take that.

597
00:48:12,022 --> 00:48:13,281
We did it!

598
00:48:13,318 --> 00:48:16,647
That was amazing!
Way to go, Tails.

599
00:48:25,259 --> 00:48:29,952
Wow. Only Sonic the Hedgehog
could win a dance battle that epic.

600
00:48:29,959 --> 00:48:31,196
Well, stick with me, pal.

601
00:48:31,198 --> 00:48:35,198
Earth can be a scary place, but I know
everything about this old pale blue dot.

602
00:48:35,355 --> 00:48:37,064
Do you really mean that?

603
00:48:37,147 --> 00:48:40,730
I mean, not everything.
But I watch a lot of Discovery Channel and...

604
00:48:40,740 --> 00:48:43,615
I meant about me being your pal.

605
00:48:45,314 --> 00:48:46,730
Of course, buddy.

606
00:48:50,022 --> 00:48:51,624
Comin' in hot.

607
00:48:51,939 --> 00:48:54,647
Growing up, I didn't have any friends.

608
00:48:54,737 --> 00:48:57,654
Everyone in my village
thought my two tails were weird.

609
00:48:57,730 --> 00:48:59,480
Hey, I know that feeling.

610
00:48:59,482 --> 00:49:03,523
But then I saw you,
the fastest creature in the galaxy.

611
00:49:03,689 --> 00:49:07,780
You were weird too.
But you were a legend.

612
00:49:08,064 --> 00:49:11,710
That made me think,
maybe being weird isn't so bad.

613
00:49:11,712 --> 00:49:14,889
You inspired me to leave my village,

614
00:49:14,939 --> 00:49:17,612
to find you and help you in your mission.

615
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:20,272
I'm really glad you're here, Tails.

616
00:49:20,749 --> 00:49:22,592
I'm glad I'm here too, Sonic.

617
00:49:28,230 --> 00:49:31,366
Well, might as well get some sleep.

618
00:49:31,374 --> 00:49:33,592
This feels like a good place
to spend the night.

619
00:49:33,592 --> 00:49:35,592
You'll be able to get clear readings
on your gizmo thing

620
00:49:35,592 --> 00:49:37,866
once the storm is over, so I...

621
00:49:49,939 --> 00:49:51,506
Night, Tails.

622
00:50:05,189 --> 00:50:08,486
Tails. Tails.
We have a situation.

623
00:50:15,092 --> 00:50:18,005
Today's forecast calls for
clear, sunny skies

624
00:50:18,005 --> 00:50:20,980
and a 100% chance of adventure.

625
00:50:20,989 --> 00:50:24,447
I pinpointed the coordinates.
It's right up ahead.

626
00:50:38,241 --> 00:50:39,811
Hey, Tails. Wait up.

627
00:50:44,925 --> 00:50:49,835
Okay, we got a giant owl door.
Seems encouraging.

628
00:51:02,564 --> 00:51:03,798
Check this out.

629
00:51:03,798 --> 00:51:06,783
- Can you translate that?
- Yeah.

630
00:51:08,095 --> 00:51:11,205
Ages ago, a fearsome group of warriors,

631
00:51:11,212 --> 00:51:12,779
known as the Echidnas,

632
00:51:12,781 --> 00:51:15,134
forged the Seven Chaos Emeralds

633
00:51:15,230 --> 00:51:19,150
into the most unstoppable weapon
ever created.

634
00:51:22,158 --> 00:51:23,897
The Master Emerald.

635
00:51:23,980 --> 00:51:26,650
With it, a single warrior

636
00:51:26,650 --> 00:51:29,267
could defeat entire armies.

637
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:34,173
Believing no one should have such power,

638
00:51:34,923 --> 00:51:37,509
an order of heroes recovered the Emerald

639
00:51:37,814 --> 00:51:40,517
and swore to protect it from evil.

640
00:51:41,754 --> 00:51:43,312
Sounds like the Owls and the Echidnas

641
00:51:43,314 --> 00:51:45,772
have been fighting each other
for centuries.

642
00:51:45,855 --> 00:51:47,923
Like Vin Diesel and The Rock.

643
00:51:49,608 --> 00:51:50,908
Wait for me.

644
00:51:57,439 --> 00:52:01,689
Okay, giant owl door, giant owl.
Makes sense.

645
00:52:12,972 --> 00:52:15,955
Wait a second.
I've seen these symbols before.

646
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:21,392
Here we go.

647
00:52:29,814 --> 00:52:31,400
Well, that did something.

648
00:52:48,912 --> 00:52:52,116
- The compass!
- This will lead us to the Emerald!

649
00:52:57,646 --> 00:53:00,187
Hey, you got a little something on your...

650
00:53:00,189 --> 00:53:02,975
Oh, no. Tails, get back.

651
00:53:07,678 --> 00:53:08,717
Run!

652
00:53:16,030 --> 00:53:17,092
That guy again?

653
00:53:17,092 --> 00:53:20,605
Heads up, my little stalagmites.
Someone call an Uber?

654
00:53:20,689 --> 00:53:24,327
Hey, thanks for doing all the hard stuff.

655
00:53:27,397 --> 00:53:29,522
But we'll take it from here.

656
00:53:29,975 --> 00:53:32,105
Okay, we really gotta talk
about your new look.

657
00:53:32,107 --> 00:53:34,994
It's like Professor X
meets the Monopoly man.

658
00:53:35,022 --> 00:53:38,764
And what kind of genius
shows up to Siberia in a convertible?

659
00:53:38,772 --> 00:53:41,772
The kind of genius
that can turn up the heat...

660
00:53:43,532 --> 00:53:45,436
with a flick of a switch.

661
00:53:57,026 --> 00:53:59,605
Good one!
I'm sure that wasn't important.

662
00:54:01,904 --> 00:54:04,253
Tails, that's our exit.
Come on.

663
00:54:18,217 --> 00:54:19,204
Let's split up.

664
00:54:19,272 --> 00:54:21,772
- You go high, I go low.
- Right.

665
00:54:21,855 --> 00:54:24,733
Quick little stretch and here we go.

666
00:54:36,189 --> 00:54:37,729
So you want to play?

667
00:54:42,806 --> 00:54:44,267
That's new.

668
00:54:55,339 --> 00:54:56,628
Sonic!

669
00:55:09,892 --> 00:55:11,377
Snowball fight!

670
00:55:16,751 --> 00:55:20,752
It's too easy.
Come on, challenge me!

671
00:55:34,730 --> 00:55:37,845
We are talking style and pizzazz.

672
00:55:45,064 --> 00:55:47,877
Yeah!
I make this look good.

673
00:55:50,147 --> 00:55:52,580
Oh, great. The Winter Soldier.

674
00:55:59,272 --> 00:56:02,603
For a guy named Knuckles,
you are really bad at punching.

675
00:56:02,689 --> 00:56:05,480
Surrender the compass!
You are no match for me.

676
00:56:05,482 --> 00:56:08,022
I've been training for this
my entire life.

677
00:56:08,022 --> 00:56:11,647
And I had no training at all,
yet here I am ahead of you.

678
00:56:11,730 --> 00:56:13,923
That's gotta be embarrassing.

679
00:56:20,337 --> 00:56:21,759
My rings!

680
00:56:24,522 --> 00:56:28,158
Has anyone ever told you
you've got serious anger issues?

681
00:56:28,167 --> 00:56:30,627
You mock me with your weak jokes,

682
00:56:30,627 --> 00:56:32,897
but you know nothing about me, hedgehog.

683
00:56:32,899 --> 00:56:37,291
Well, I know you Echidnas have a habit of
showing up uninvited and ruining my life.

684
00:56:37,291 --> 00:56:40,487
Ruining your life?
Another bad joke.

685
00:56:40,489 --> 00:56:43,666
I lost everything because of you.

686
00:56:43,666 --> 00:56:46,772
My tribe was on the verge
of its greatest victory.

687
00:56:46,937 --> 00:56:49,812
The last of the Owl warriors
had been located.

688
00:56:49,814 --> 00:56:53,564
Soon Longclaw's Emerald secrets
would be ours.

689
00:56:53,655 --> 00:56:57,228
But my father stopped me
from joining the fight.

690
00:56:57,251 --> 00:57:00,503
He said my moment
to honor our tribe would come,

691
00:57:00,564 --> 00:57:03,041
but it was not this moment.

692
00:57:03,041 --> 00:57:05,397
Those were the last words he spoke to me.

693
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:08,041
I never saw him again.

694
00:57:09,478 --> 00:57:11,939
We both lost everything that day.

695
00:57:14,134 --> 00:57:16,072
- Goodbye, Sonic.
- No!

696
00:57:16,072 --> 00:57:17,774
Longclaw!

697
00:57:22,147 --> 00:57:24,022
Sonic! Are you okay?

698
00:57:24,024 --> 00:57:25,337
Deceiver!

699
00:57:26,244 --> 00:57:28,486
No, it wasn't a trick.

700
00:57:28,821 --> 00:57:31,647
Tails, take the compass
and get out of here!

701
00:57:34,605 --> 00:57:36,147
Yeah!

702
00:57:36,939 --> 00:57:39,196
Later, haters!

703
00:57:42,189 --> 00:57:43,314
Tails!

704
00:57:50,385 --> 00:57:51,969
Tails, come on. Wake up.

705
00:57:52,107 --> 00:57:54,815
He chose helping the fox
over pursuing the compass.

706
00:57:54,939 --> 00:57:59,291
Of course he did.
New friend, same pathetic weakness.

707
00:58:09,397 --> 00:58:12,728
Oh, no. No, no, no.
We're in real trouble here.

708
00:58:12,736 --> 00:58:14,523
Come on, Tails.
I need you to fly us out of here.

709
00:58:14,530 --> 00:58:15,986
Time to wake up.

710
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:26,285
See ya, kids.
Enjoy the fresh powder.

711
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:52,564
Did you...

712
00:58:58,205 --> 00:59:01,119
These rings signify the...

713
00:59:06,955 --> 00:59:08,064
Sorry.

714
00:59:08,494 --> 00:59:10,017
Thought it was on silent.

715
00:59:16,439 --> 00:59:17,861
These rings...

716
00:59:19,943 --> 00:59:21,533
So help me, Thomas!

717
00:59:26,283 --> 00:59:27,562
Okay, sorry, sorry.

718
00:59:27,564 --> 00:59:29,462
Excuse me, this is an emergency.

719
00:59:30,831 --> 00:59:31,994
Sorry.

720
00:59:37,673 --> 00:59:40,025
What? This better be important.
I just...

721
00:59:40,603 --> 00:59:41,603
Are you skiing?

722
00:59:41,605 --> 00:59:43,855
Snowboarding, actually.
But I need your help now.

723
00:59:43,857 --> 00:59:46,252
Life or death situation this very second.

724
00:59:46,252 --> 00:59:48,377
I need you to use the ring
I gave you to save me.

725
00:59:48,377 --> 00:59:49,580
Like right now.

726
00:59:49,582 --> 00:59:51,877
Okay, slow down.
I don't even know where you are.

727
00:59:51,877 --> 00:59:54,041
You just gotta picture
where you want the ring to go.

728
00:59:54,041 --> 00:59:55,439
So picture this.

729
00:59:58,025 --> 01:00:01,002
Oh, my God. Okay, okay.
Hang on.

730
01:00:09,220 --> 01:00:10,048
What?

731
01:00:11,566 --> 01:00:12,814
Did you throw it?

732
01:00:13,772 --> 01:00:15,970
- Oh, God.
- What? Tell me what "Oh, God."

733
01:00:15,970 --> 01:00:17,994
I mixed up the rings
when I was teasing Jojo.

734
01:00:17,994 --> 01:00:19,658
What? Where is it then?
Where is it then?

735
01:00:23,814 --> 01:00:24,751
You don't want to know.

736
01:00:25,001 --> 01:00:26,228
But I do, Tom.

737
01:00:26,228 --> 01:00:27,698
I very much want to know,

738
01:00:27,698 --> 01:00:30,272
before I become
a hedgehog-flavored snow cone.

739
01:00:30,355 --> 01:00:32,345
Hang tight, buddy.
I got this.

740
01:00:32,345 --> 01:00:34,314
With this ring, Rachel...

741
01:00:34,759 --> 01:00:36,189
Hey! Hi.

742
01:00:37,470 --> 01:00:38,759
Everything okay, bud?

743
01:00:38,987 --> 01:00:40,244
- Not really.
- What are you doing?

744
01:00:40,244 --> 01:00:44,072
This is gonna sound crazy, but I need
to see that ring for just one second, one second.

745
01:00:44,074 --> 01:00:46,758
- Have you lost your mind?
- I'm gonna give it right back, I promise.

746
01:00:46,758 --> 01:00:49,455
- Please, Randall, it's really important.
- No, bro. Go sit down.

747
01:00:49,455 --> 01:00:52,244
- Give me the ring, please?
- Randall, don't look at him, look at me.

748
01:00:52,244 --> 01:00:52,830
Randall, Randall.

749
01:00:52,830 --> 01:00:54,486
- One second.
- Put the ring on my finger.

750
01:00:54,486 --> 01:00:57,541
- No, Randall, listen to me.
- Randall! Look at me. Ring on my finger.

751
01:00:57,541 --> 01:01:00,272
- Give me the ring! Just one second.
- Put a ring on it!

752
01:01:01,022 --> 01:01:02,397
Please, love? Okay?

753
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:03,220
With this ring...

754
01:01:03,220 --> 01:01:05,166
- Yes, baby.
- I'm so sorry about this.

755
01:01:15,402 --> 01:01:17,706
- Snow, my God.
- Oh, boy.

756
01:01:18,519 --> 01:01:21,222
Incoming!

757
01:01:31,397 --> 01:01:32,814
Anybody hurt?

758
01:01:33,030 --> 01:01:35,163
- Sonic!
- Hawaii.

759
01:01:35,163 --> 01:01:36,053
Are you okay?

760
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:38,230
What's happening?
Are you hurt?

761
01:01:38,314 --> 01:01:40,631
- No, no, no, I'm fine.
- Okay, good.

762
01:01:40,631 --> 01:01:43,897
- Because you're in so much trouble!
- Okay, you calm down.

763
01:01:43,980 --> 01:01:45,314
You talk.

764
01:01:45,397 --> 01:01:46,814
Okay, quick version.

765
01:01:46,897 --> 01:01:50,303
Robotnik is back on Earth
and he's after a magic emerald.

766
01:01:51,230 --> 01:01:54,085
We need to get it back
or the world is doomed.

767
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:55,506
Tails!

768
01:01:55,506 --> 01:01:59,264
- Wait! All this happened since yesterday?
- Wait. Who's Tails?

769
01:01:59,264 --> 01:02:00,381
Tails, can you hear me?

770
01:02:00,842 --> 01:02:02,436
Oh, Lord, there are two of them now.

771
01:02:02,436 --> 01:02:05,212
Okay, okay, let me think, let me think.
Tails, come on, buddy.

772
01:02:09,423 --> 01:02:10,256
Hey!

773
01:02:10,350 --> 01:02:13,725
Randall, why do all of your friends
have weapons?

774
01:02:15,553 --> 01:02:19,131
You really should have taken me up
on that brunch, Mr. and Mrs. Wachowski.

775
01:02:19,314 --> 01:02:20,355
Olive Garden guy?

776
01:02:20,357 --> 01:02:23,194
It's okay, everyone.
We're federal agents.

777
01:02:24,277 --> 01:02:26,405
You, too, Agent. Go ahead.

778
01:02:32,730 --> 01:02:36,814
You mean to tell me
that this entire wedding was a setup?

779
01:02:36,897 --> 01:02:38,764
- Rachel, wait a minute.
- What?

780
01:02:38,764 --> 01:02:39,717
That's correct, ma'am.

781
01:02:39,717 --> 01:02:43,600
Every single aspect of Operation Catfish
was a complete fabrication.

782
01:02:44,397 --> 01:02:46,342
Operation Catfish?

783
01:02:46,647 --> 01:02:48,686
So is everyone here an agent?

784
01:02:49,634 --> 01:02:51,194
Are you an agent?

785
01:02:51,759 --> 01:02:53,124
Son of a...

786
01:02:53,355 --> 01:02:56,689
Was the florist an agent?
How about the photographer?

787
01:02:57,314 --> 01:02:59,077
The woman who waxed my...

788
01:02:59,814 --> 01:03:01,108
at the spa?

789
01:03:02,694 --> 01:03:05,022
- Is Jojo an agent?
- Rachel.

790
01:03:05,524 --> 01:03:07,649
- What?
- Rachel, listen to me.

791
01:03:07,656 --> 01:03:11,069
I'm done listening!
I am done listening!

792
01:03:11,272 --> 01:03:14,272
I am so sorry.
I am so sorry.

793
01:03:14,385 --> 01:03:16,249
I really am.
I am so sorry.

794
01:03:18,335 --> 01:03:20,006
No. Hey, no!

795
01:03:21,017 --> 01:03:23,514
Let him go! Hey!

796
01:03:26,064 --> 01:03:27,483
Sonic, hang on.

797
01:03:28,275 --> 01:03:30,741
- Take it easy. It's not worth it.
- Tom!

798
01:03:31,355 --> 01:03:34,069
Sonic is not a threat.
He's on our side.

799
01:03:34,069 --> 01:03:35,939
He's an uncontrolled extraterrestrial.

800
01:03:36,022 --> 01:03:38,514
And your days of aiding
and abetting him are over.

801
01:03:38,855 --> 01:03:41,264
Secure them in the hotel
until the chopper arrives.

802
01:03:41,647 --> 01:03:42,897
You're making a mistake.

803
01:03:42,980 --> 01:03:44,749
Hold on, Major A-hole!

804
01:03:45,270 --> 01:03:47,155
This is still my day,

805
01:03:47,155 --> 01:03:50,678
and someone is gonna explain to me
what the hell is going on here!

806
01:03:50,678 --> 01:03:54,389
After the events in San Francisco,
a global task force was created,

807
01:03:54,389 --> 01:03:57,272
devoted to protecting our planet
from alien threats.

808
01:03:57,274 --> 01:04:00,053
That day,
Guardian Units of Nations was born.

809
01:04:00,350 --> 01:04:02,874
- G-U-N. Seriously?
- GUN, yeah.

810
01:04:02,874 --> 01:04:05,936
Look, what about protecting our planet
from Dr. Robotnik?

811
01:04:06,689 --> 01:04:08,064
Robotnik is dead.

812
01:04:08,066 --> 01:04:10,191
You're wrong.
He's back.

813
01:04:10,347 --> 01:04:12,905
And you just hauled away the only ones
who could stop him.

814
01:04:15,868 --> 01:04:17,710
Sounds like Robotnik
might be back in play.

815
01:04:17,710 --> 01:04:20,381
If he is, I want him found immediately.

816
01:04:21,376 --> 01:04:23,780
And cancel my five o'clock
at the Olive Garden.

817
01:04:24,327 --> 01:04:25,812
- Aunt Maddie?
- Yeah.

818
01:04:25,814 --> 01:04:27,569
Sonic and his friend dropped this.

819
01:04:34,416 --> 01:04:35,730
I have an idea.

820
01:04:35,830 --> 01:04:37,996
And I want to have a word with my fiance.

821
01:04:38,133 --> 01:04:40,017
And that word is "murder."

822
01:04:45,147 --> 01:04:47,189
Hey, come on.
You can't just leave us in here.

823
01:04:47,272 --> 01:04:50,884
My friend is hurt!
He needs a doctor, a vet, anyone!

824
01:04:51,855 --> 01:04:55,103
Tails, you got to wake up, buddy.
Please wake up.

825
01:05:03,252 --> 01:05:04,384
All clear.

826
01:05:07,730 --> 01:05:09,314
All right. Game plan.

827
01:05:09,397 --> 01:05:12,087
I get inside the hotel and find
where they're hiding Tom and Sonic.

828
01:05:12,087 --> 01:05:14,064
Okay.
Then I find Randall, right?

829
01:05:14,066 --> 01:05:15,736
And then I squeeze the breath

830
01:05:15,736 --> 01:05:20,228
from his lying, deceitful,
perfectly manscaped body!

831
01:05:22,186 --> 01:05:23,895
I'm going through a lot right now.

832
01:05:23,905 --> 01:05:27,283
- So let me process this my own way, okay?
- Sure, sure.

833
01:05:27,647 --> 01:05:29,244
- No judgment.
- Should've brought a journal.

834
01:05:29,244 --> 01:05:30,416
Okay...

835
01:05:30,869 --> 01:05:34,736
Okay. Is this meant to be a weapon?
This is adorable.

836
01:05:35,548 --> 01:05:37,025
Take that, Randall!

837
01:05:37,373 --> 01:05:38,758
Run, Randall!

838
01:05:38,896 --> 01:05:40,312
All right.

839
01:05:40,673 --> 01:05:42,525
- We're about to find out.
- All right!

840
01:05:42,525 --> 01:05:44,439
Let's go kick some booty.

841
01:05:57,526 --> 01:05:59,353
Rachel! No. Rachel!

842
01:06:00,269 --> 01:06:01,533
In a minute.

843
01:06:07,345 --> 01:06:08,462
Stop right there!

844
01:06:08,821 --> 01:06:09,915
Get the bag.

845
01:06:18,532 --> 01:06:19,821
He's gonna come back down, right?

846
01:06:19,823 --> 01:06:21,176
I don't know.

847
01:06:21,439 --> 01:06:22,502
Good luck!

848
01:06:24,884 --> 01:06:27,423
Look. Tom and Sonic
have to be inside.

849
01:06:27,647 --> 01:06:29,439
I got a fiance to vaporize.

850
01:06:29,522 --> 01:06:31,228
- Watch your back, sis.
- Okay.

851
01:06:34,158 --> 01:06:35,134
Randall!

852
01:06:42,576 --> 01:06:45,111
We got her. Move in.

853
01:06:49,080 --> 01:06:50,337
Okay.

854
01:07:05,595 --> 01:07:07,611
I did not mean to do that!

855
01:07:20,355 --> 01:07:22,314
Something bothering you, Agent?

856
01:07:22,759 --> 01:07:25,486
I just feel a little guilty
about what I did to Rachel, sir.

857
01:07:26,189 --> 01:07:28,439
Don't worry about it.
We'll send her a gift card.

858
01:07:28,522 --> 01:07:30,947
Now, I propose a toast.

859
01:07:33,933 --> 01:07:36,923
To a perfectly executed operation.

860
01:07:41,464 --> 01:07:43,131
Sir, we're under attack.

861
01:08:03,397 --> 01:08:07,212
Randall, wifey's home!

862
01:08:11,603 --> 01:08:13,587
Oh, my God. Rachel.

863
01:08:37,905 --> 01:08:40,738
What a woman.

864
01:08:42,850 --> 01:08:44,470
You no-good,

865
01:08:45,222 --> 01:08:48,525
lowdown, dirty, lying...

866
01:08:48,525 --> 01:08:49,699
Rachel, just listen to me.

867
01:08:49,699 --> 01:08:54,384
What kind of twisted sicko
tricks someone into a fake wedding?

868
01:08:56,397 --> 01:08:58,962
Party's over, Bridezilla.
Stop right there.

869
01:09:00,188 --> 01:09:02,322
You son of a...

870
01:09:02,322 --> 01:09:03,916
- Have it your way.
- No!

871
01:09:04,447 --> 01:09:06,072
No!

872
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:13,454
Very disappointing, Agent Handel.

873
01:09:16,230 --> 01:09:19,647
- Is that supposed to be a weapon?
- I don't know, but we gonna find out.

874
01:09:19,737 --> 01:09:22,154
Haven't you caused enough trouble
for one day?

875
01:09:22,163 --> 01:09:24,689
I haven't even begun causing trouble.

876
01:09:25,189 --> 01:09:28,587
Hell hath no fury like a bride scorned.

877
01:09:35,147 --> 01:09:37,869
Looks like it's real, huh?

878
01:09:41,689 --> 01:09:43,064
No. Right.

879
01:09:44,972 --> 01:09:47,705
Be honest.
How bad is it?

880
01:09:48,037 --> 01:09:51,166
Not bad at all.
You got Tased. You'll be fine.

881
01:09:55,308 --> 01:09:58,725
- I'm so cold.
- You landed on our ice sculpture.

882
01:09:59,057 --> 01:10:00,322
Get up.

883
01:10:06,068 --> 01:10:07,217
Just...

884
01:10:07,638 --> 01:10:10,884
Just tell me the truth, for once.

885
01:10:11,704 --> 01:10:16,384
Is there anything about you
or about us that was real?

886
01:10:16,647 --> 01:10:20,236
Rachel, look at me.

887
01:10:21,228 --> 01:10:25,503
Before I met you, I didn't think
that I was even capable of real happiness.

888
01:10:26,552 --> 01:10:29,188
But that all changed
when you walked into my life.

889
01:10:30,022 --> 01:10:33,134
And I ended up breaking the first rule
of undercover work.

890
01:10:33,480 --> 01:10:34,855
Which is?

891
01:10:35,605 --> 01:10:37,080
Never fall in love.

892
01:10:50,147 --> 01:10:52,814
- Maddie!
- We're busting out of here.

893
01:10:52,886 --> 01:10:54,094
How'd you get past the guards?

894
01:10:54,096 --> 01:10:56,236
Because that little fox
is into some crazy stuff.

895
01:10:56,236 --> 01:10:57,408
Come on.

896
01:10:58,792 --> 01:11:00,564
- Let's go.
- You're amazing.

897
01:11:11,105 --> 01:11:14,344
The Owls were fools to think
they could hide this.

898
01:11:52,230 --> 01:11:53,397
What's happening?

899
01:11:54,935 --> 01:11:56,602
Wait for it.

900
01:12:08,230 --> 01:12:10,660
Yes. Eureka!

901
01:12:11,696 --> 01:12:13,511
I've found it!

902
01:12:32,850 --> 01:12:34,178
Sonic.

903
01:12:35,980 --> 01:12:38,022
- What is that?
- A big problem.

904
01:12:38,772 --> 01:12:40,689
The compass led Robotnik to the Emerald.

905
01:12:40,691 --> 01:12:42,944
That's got to be hundreds of miles away.

906
01:12:44,230 --> 01:12:47,647
All right. Huddle up.
Let's figure out a plan.

907
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:49,936
- Together.
- There's no time for that.

908
01:12:49,936 --> 01:12:51,960
I'm the only one
that can get there fast enough.

909
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:55,030
Sonic, this is way too big for you
to do by yourself.

910
01:12:55,417 --> 01:12:57,389
You see that little fox over there?

911
01:12:57,454 --> 01:13:00,454
He came all the way across the universe
to meet his hero.

912
01:13:00,522 --> 01:13:03,936
And what did his hero do?
I practically got him killed.

913
01:13:04,314 --> 01:13:06,374
You know what?
You were right.

914
01:13:06,814 --> 01:13:10,717
My moment came and I blew it.
I'm no hero.

915
01:13:10,717 --> 01:13:11,689
- Wait.
- No.

916
01:13:11,772 --> 01:13:14,105
I'm not letting anyone else get hurt
because of me.

917
01:13:14,197 --> 01:13:16,223
I'm gonna fix this while I still can.

918
01:13:17,645 --> 01:13:19,270
Sonic!

919
01:13:19,357 --> 01:13:21,124
Sonic, wait!

920
01:13:23,459 --> 01:13:25,350
Hold on. Hold on.
Wait, wait, wait.

921
01:13:25,480 --> 01:13:28,155
- Don't move. Don't move.
- Take it easy, little guy. You're hurt.

922
01:13:28,155 --> 01:13:31,905
But we have to help him.
You don't know what he's up against.

923
01:13:39,001 --> 01:13:40,376
You believe us now?

924
01:13:47,439 --> 01:13:48,522
Hey, Bob!

925
01:13:48,524 --> 01:13:50,577
Hey, Maria, how you doing?

926
01:13:54,021 --> 01:13:55,045
Working on my moves.

927
01:13:55,045 --> 01:13:57,689
Just keepin' it green.
No need to burn the fuel.

928
01:13:57,691 --> 01:13:59,092
Speaking of fuel...

929
01:14:05,219 --> 01:14:06,594
Closed?

930
01:14:08,155 --> 01:14:09,519
That doesn't seem right.

931
01:14:22,483 --> 01:14:23,499
Close.

932
01:14:27,737 --> 01:14:29,029
Yes.

933
01:14:29,186 --> 01:14:31,811
Makeover, makeover.
Look at you.

934
01:14:31,834 --> 01:14:33,271
Freeze! Police!

935
01:14:34,569 --> 01:14:37,022
Oh, my God, you got robot hands.
You got robot hands.

936
01:14:37,022 --> 01:14:40,366
- No, they're gloves.
- Get 'em up. Now spread your fingers!

937
01:14:41,510 --> 01:14:44,522
Now wiggle 'em!
Wiggle your digits!

938
01:14:45,439 --> 01:14:48,803
Yes! Like you just finished
a big musical number.

939
01:14:49,939 --> 01:14:51,178
Good.

940
01:14:51,564 --> 01:14:53,108
Why is there a light on your head?

941
01:14:56,913 --> 01:14:59,264
'Cause I'm the sheriff
for the weekend, pal.

942
01:15:08,064 --> 01:15:09,327
Water.

943
01:15:09,327 --> 01:15:11,405
Why did it have to be water?

944
01:15:14,365 --> 01:15:16,740
Okay, you can do this.

945
01:15:20,341 --> 01:15:21,924
Gotta go fast.

946
01:17:04,916 --> 01:17:08,252
I don't want to die like this!
It's derivative!

947
01:17:09,681 --> 01:17:11,580
Make room for Daddy!

948
01:17:19,048 --> 01:17:20,110
Two and two.

949
01:17:20,203 --> 01:17:23,962
Great!
We're still bipedals, more or less.

950
01:17:27,252 --> 01:17:28,509
Fire in the hole!

951
01:17:30,592 --> 01:17:34,056
I've solved it. There is a booby trap
every seven seco...

952
01:17:40,522 --> 01:17:42,017
That was a little early.

953
01:17:43,428 --> 01:17:47,330
So glad it didn't cut off my mustache.

954
01:17:47,330 --> 01:17:49,853
Hey, Little Red Wrecking Ball.

955
01:17:50,314 --> 01:17:52,647
I know you're dying
to get your Emerald on,

956
01:17:52,649 --> 01:17:56,627
but can we be a little bit more mindful
of our surroundings?

957
01:17:56,939 --> 01:17:58,197
May I?

958
01:18:04,635 --> 01:18:07,218
In 30 feet, turn left.

959
01:18:07,243 --> 01:18:09,580
Work smarter, not harder.

960
01:18:30,605 --> 01:18:32,363
My pelvis.

961
01:18:36,378 --> 01:18:40,878
Okay, Secret Temple,
let's see what you've got.

962
01:18:48,829 --> 01:18:50,572
No, no, no! No!

963
01:18:55,102 --> 01:18:56,502
No.

964
01:18:57,189 --> 01:18:58,189
Yes!

965
01:19:04,147 --> 01:19:06,064
You have arrived at your destination.

966
01:19:06,154 --> 01:19:09,154
Wow. That really
opened up the space.

967
01:19:09,237 --> 01:19:12,196
I can't even picture it
with an impenetrable wall now.

968
01:19:12,272 --> 01:19:14,389
And the rubble is always a nice touch.

969
01:19:23,460 --> 01:19:27,131
At last.
The Master Emerald.

970
01:19:27,230 --> 01:19:28,480
Ultimate power.

971
01:19:28,482 --> 01:19:31,315
Soon order will be restored.

972
01:19:31,440 --> 01:19:34,491
All because of what we have done together.

973
01:19:34,818 --> 01:19:37,452
Such a lovely sentiment, Knuckles.

974
01:19:37,673 --> 01:19:40,460
I think I feel a single tear forming.

975
01:19:43,151 --> 01:19:44,288
Sadly...

976
01:19:45,327 --> 01:19:50,085
you're as useful to me now
as a backstage pass to Limp Bizkit.

977
01:20:04,855 --> 01:20:06,022
Nailed it.

978
01:20:07,543 --> 01:20:11,035
This guy is always trying to spoil
a bad thing!

979
01:20:12,022 --> 01:20:14,769
You guys are here, too?
Took the long way, huh?

980
01:20:14,769 --> 01:20:16,772
Is everything a joke to you?

981
01:20:16,789 --> 01:20:20,082
Why must you constantly interfere
with my destiny?

982
01:20:20,088 --> 01:20:23,851
Because my destiny is to protect
my friends and family.

983
01:20:23,983 --> 01:20:26,378
I think I just threw up in my mouth.

984
01:20:26,542 --> 01:20:32,207
And if you want that emerald,
you're gonna have to go through me.

985
01:20:54,221 --> 01:20:57,263
The Echidna's taking no prisoners today!

986
01:20:57,503 --> 01:21:01,464
Sonic has heart,
but will he lose the quill to live?

987
01:21:02,878 --> 01:21:06,839
I don't want to fight you,
but you're not giving me much choice.

988
01:21:13,189 --> 01:21:16,244
Too easy.
Let's do this.

989
01:21:42,902 --> 01:21:47,636
Why don't you stand still
and die with honor?

990
01:21:47,644 --> 01:21:48,863
Let me think about it.

991
01:21:49,042 --> 01:21:52,777
Okay, I thought about it and I pass.

992
01:22:02,142 --> 01:22:03,720
Hi there, beautiful.

993
01:22:04,907 --> 01:22:07,119
You're the real deal, aren't you?

994
01:22:07,522 --> 01:22:11,158
Where have you been all my life?

995
01:22:14,978 --> 01:22:17,525
Say goodbye, hedgehog.

996
01:22:20,772 --> 01:22:23,647
Knuckles, stop.
Robotnik's stealing the Emerald!

997
01:22:23,730 --> 01:22:26,337
What kind of fool do you take me for?

998
01:22:26,337 --> 01:22:27,522
Just look.

999
01:22:30,072 --> 01:22:31,405
Mine.

1000
01:22:32,647 --> 01:22:35,649
Wait!
That wasn't the deal.

1001
01:22:38,814 --> 01:22:41,439
You poor, naive creature.

1002
01:22:41,522 --> 01:22:42,939
It's not your fault.

1003
01:22:43,037 --> 01:22:46,662
A more advanced intellect would have seen
this move coming a mile away.

1004
01:22:46,730 --> 01:22:48,791
Or 1.6 kilometers.

1005
01:22:48,798 --> 01:22:52,072
But I trusted you!
You were my friend!

1006
01:22:58,893 --> 01:23:01,886
I'm sorry.
That just hit me funny.

1007
01:23:02,258 --> 01:23:07,683
Let this be my final lesson to you,
you dim-witted celestial skin tag.

1008
01:23:08,314 --> 01:23:09,689
Friends...

1009
01:23:09,772 --> 01:23:13,772
are open, honest
and vulnerable with each other.

1010
01:23:13,855 --> 01:23:16,613
Which means X squared
times the hypotenuse of Y squared,

1011
01:23:16,613 --> 01:23:19,753
divided by the absolute value
of friendship, equals...

1012
01:23:19,814 --> 01:23:20,855
dookie!

1013
01:23:21,128 --> 01:23:22,321
Oh, no.

1014
01:23:30,345 --> 01:23:35,736
Chaos is power!

1015
01:23:54,272 --> 01:23:55,897
Let's get out of here!

1016
01:24:07,939 --> 01:24:09,479
Knuckles!

1017
01:24:13,610 --> 01:24:16,767
Water again?
Come on!

1018
01:25:15,016 --> 01:25:19,509
- You saved me.
- Don't talk to me. I'm not in the mood.

1019
01:25:20,605 --> 01:25:25,322
How dare you attack me
in my hour of sorrow!

1020
01:25:25,550 --> 01:25:27,377
Why did you save me?

1021
01:25:28,759 --> 01:25:30,908
Because you saved me first,

1022
01:25:30,910 --> 01:25:34,577
which clearly gave you
a tactical advantage I do not understand.

1023
01:25:34,647 --> 01:25:38,705
It wasn't a tactic.
I couldn't just let you die.

1024
01:25:39,314 --> 01:25:44,064
Why? I've been trying to destroy you
since the moment we met.

1025
01:25:44,252 --> 01:25:48,064
Because being a hero
isn't about taking care of yourself.

1026
01:25:48,147 --> 01:25:51,564
It's about taking responsibility
for other people.

1027
01:25:53,855 --> 01:25:57,105
Wise words.
An ancient Earth proverb?

1028
01:25:57,189 --> 01:25:59,605
No, sir,
that's a Wachowski family special.

1029
01:25:59,689 --> 01:26:01,689
I got it from a guy in a rowboat.

1030
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:04,212
Someone who means a lot to me.

1031
01:26:05,855 --> 01:26:07,564
Wait a second.
What's that sound?

1032
01:26:09,610 --> 01:26:13,742
Only Sonic the Hedgehog
needs rescuing this much.

1033
01:26:14,248 --> 01:26:16,423
That sly little fox!

1034
01:26:18,806 --> 01:26:21,642
Come on, Knucklehead.
We're not beat yet.

1035
01:26:21,855 --> 01:26:24,822
On the mountain,
you told me you'd lost everything.

1036
01:26:25,029 --> 01:26:26,529
The way I did.

1037
01:26:26,605 --> 01:26:29,355
But you seem so hopeful and free.

1038
01:26:30,355 --> 01:26:34,541
How did you move forward
despite failing again?

1039
01:26:34,689 --> 01:26:38,025
And again. And again.
And again. And again.

1040
01:26:38,048 --> 01:26:41,798
Okay, I didn't fail that much.
But I didn't do this all alone.

1041
01:26:41,798 --> 01:26:44,556
I found a new family.
New friends.

1042
01:26:44,556 --> 01:26:45,962
And you can too.

1043
01:26:48,322 --> 01:26:50,853
You don't have to be alone anymore.

1044
01:26:55,480 --> 01:26:58,025
Are you kidding me with that handshake?

1045
01:27:00,326 --> 01:27:01,743
I'm done playing games, pal.

1046
01:27:03,417 --> 01:27:05,408
You're gonna tell me what I want to know.

1047
01:27:07,641 --> 01:27:11,283
And I am asking you for the last time...

1048
01:27:13,272 --> 01:27:15,730
what would you like on your bagel?

1049
01:27:15,986 --> 01:27:17,730
I'm not telling you anything.

1050
01:27:17,732 --> 01:27:20,648
And that is a display bagel.

1051
01:27:20,814 --> 01:27:24,022
I don't get it with you!
I mean, I've tried everything.

1052
01:27:24,105 --> 01:27:27,730
I was good cop. I was bad cop.
I was cop who offers you a bagel.

1053
01:27:27,814 --> 01:27:28,923
And nothing. It's like...

1054
01:27:28,923 --> 01:27:31,073
That is a display bagel.
Wow.

1055
01:27:40,470 --> 01:27:42,289
Doctor, you're here.

1056
01:27:44,147 --> 01:27:49,210
Yes, I'm here, and yet I'm...

1057
01:27:50,397 --> 01:27:52,280
not all there.

1058
01:27:52,303 --> 01:27:53,670
Sir, are you feeling okay?

1059
01:27:53,672 --> 01:27:57,797
I'm more than okay.

1060
01:27:58,480 --> 01:28:01,605
I'm upgraded.

1061
01:28:01,689 --> 01:28:04,730
Sinister 3.0.

1062
01:28:04,814 --> 01:28:09,441
My game is next level.

1063
01:28:14,162 --> 01:28:15,210
Hi.

1064
01:28:17,982 --> 01:28:21,870
I can smell the electricity

1065
01:28:21,870 --> 01:28:24,443
in your brain.

1066
01:28:26,068 --> 01:28:28,616
You smell like a snack plate.

1067
01:28:29,647 --> 01:28:32,772
Yeah, that's fair.
I had a couple today.

1068
01:28:33,314 --> 01:28:34,936
Sit down.

1069
01:28:39,439 --> 01:28:41,100
In the chair.

1070
01:28:43,923 --> 01:28:45,420
I didn't know.

1071
01:28:46,314 --> 01:28:48,772
'Cause he, 'cause he
was in the chair, so I didn't.

1072
01:28:48,772 --> 01:28:49,413
Okay.

1073
01:28:49,480 --> 01:28:51,803
Sir? We have a problem.

1074
01:28:57,230 --> 01:29:00,242
- All teams in position!
- Set up a perimeter!

1075
01:29:00,355 --> 01:29:02,168
Move! Move! Move!

1076
01:29:17,282 --> 01:29:21,228
Incorrectus, my trusty barnacle.

1077
01:29:22,022 --> 01:29:24,720
After all these years,

1078
01:29:25,147 --> 01:29:26,855
what I finally got...

1079
01:29:28,022 --> 01:29:30,228
is a solution.

1080
01:29:40,689 --> 01:29:42,564
- Commander.
- Status report.

1081
01:29:42,647 --> 01:29:46,022
Robotnik is in there with Stone and a hostage.
Possibly local PD.

1082
01:29:46,105 --> 01:29:49,480
I'm not saying he's dumb,
but if he is local PD,

1083
01:29:49,564 --> 01:29:51,228
this town's in a lot of trouble.

1084
01:29:51,980 --> 01:29:53,272
- Wade.
- Wade.

1085
01:30:07,678 --> 01:30:08,678
Okay.

1086
01:30:09,612 --> 01:30:12,154
Rockin' that new spring collection, I see.

1087
01:30:12,311 --> 01:30:16,725
Well, if it isn't the Pastry King.

1088
01:30:16,855 --> 01:30:18,194
The Donut Lord.

1089
01:30:18,480 --> 01:30:20,741
A real genius would remember
the name of the guy

1090
01:30:20,741 --> 01:30:22,545
who helped kick your butt off this planet.

1091
01:30:22,545 --> 01:30:24,952
And I'll do it again if you mess
with Green Hills.

1092
01:30:25,397 --> 01:30:29,530
Congratulations on your oh-so-temporary
sense of superiority.

1093
01:30:29,555 --> 01:30:31,874
You're finished, Robotnik!
We've taken everything.

1094
01:30:31,874 --> 01:30:34,858
Your lab, your drones, your funding!

1095
01:30:34,858 --> 01:30:38,686
Let's see how big of a man you are
without your silly little robots.

1096
01:30:39,439 --> 01:30:41,460
Would you like to see...

1097
01:30:42,806 --> 01:30:45,225
how big a man I can be?

1098
01:30:55,814 --> 01:30:58,980
Welcome to the new norm.

1099
01:31:09,272 --> 01:31:10,952
My God!

1100
01:31:14,577 --> 01:31:18,256
Doctor! Take me with you!

1101
01:31:42,642 --> 01:31:44,470
He's taking everything apart.

1102
01:31:45,341 --> 01:31:46,994
He's building something.

1103
01:31:54,548 --> 01:31:57,166
That can only be one thing.

1104
01:31:57,173 --> 01:31:59,447
The fearsome power of the Emerald.

1105
01:31:59,530 --> 01:32:03,530
If that thing really turns thoughts
into power, we are in big trouble.

1106
01:32:03,605 --> 01:32:05,845
Robotnik has a lot of bad thoughts.

1107
01:32:05,847 --> 01:32:08,430
Hey, Sonic,
are you sure it was a good idea

1108
01:32:08,430 --> 01:32:10,272
bringing you-know-who aboard?

1109
01:32:10,371 --> 01:32:14,121
Knuckles isn't really a bad guy.
He's just a little mixed up.

1110
01:32:14,196 --> 01:32:15,904
I am not mixed up!

1111
01:32:16,322 --> 01:32:21,526
I have steely focus. And I'm complex.
And that's a lot for some people.

1112
01:32:21,696 --> 01:32:24,947
Hope you're not still mad
I hit you with that car.

1113
01:32:25,064 --> 01:32:26,814
I was completely uninjured.

1114
01:32:26,897 --> 01:32:30,439
And my revenge will come
when you least expect it, fox.

1115
01:33:01,522 --> 01:33:04,397
Sir, you're magnificent!

1116
01:33:04,397 --> 01:33:06,624
Thank you, sycophant.

1117
01:33:06,624 --> 01:33:09,032
Your admiration is inevitable.

1118
01:33:18,842 --> 01:33:20,272
I knew it!

1119
01:33:20,355 --> 01:33:23,124
Just like the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man.

1120
01:33:23,959 --> 01:33:25,670
World Domination playlist.

1121
01:33:39,524 --> 01:33:40,690
Fall back.

1122
01:33:41,897 --> 01:33:44,901
Fall back! Quick! Retreat!

1123
01:33:46,730 --> 01:33:48,814
How are we supposed to beat this thing?

1124
01:33:48,897 --> 01:33:49,939
We need a plan.

1125
01:33:50,022 --> 01:33:52,284
Knuckles, use your strength to...

1126
01:33:52,647 --> 01:33:54,980
Jump off the plane. Wow.

1127
01:33:55,064 --> 01:33:58,980
Okay, this is what we're gonna do.
Step 1: Light taunting.

1128
01:33:58,982 --> 01:34:00,834
Step 2: I have no idea.

1129
01:34:04,105 --> 01:34:05,272
Sonic!

1130
01:34:08,462 --> 01:34:10,272
Nice action figure, Eggman.

1131
01:34:10,274 --> 01:34:13,478
Does it do anything
or just stand there looking ugly?

1132
01:34:16,821 --> 01:34:19,721
Like a blister, he keeps coming back!

1133
01:34:20,573 --> 01:34:23,814
He's on the okay-to-kill list.
Shoot the missiles. Make a decision.

1134
01:34:23,814 --> 01:34:26,736
I need a moment, sir.
I'm trying to figure out how to do this.

1135
01:34:26,743 --> 01:34:28,447
Did you even glance at a manual?

1136
01:34:28,743 --> 01:34:30,909
- No!
- I'll do it.

1137
01:34:31,021 --> 01:34:32,572
Pardon my lightning.

1138
01:34:32,579 --> 01:34:34,627
You might want to ground yourself.

1139
01:34:37,752 --> 01:34:40,408
I'm gonna pop that thing open
like a can of chili...

1140
01:34:42,647 --> 01:34:44,294
Hang on!

1141
01:34:57,492 --> 01:34:59,502
- Yeah!
- Close one.

1142
01:35:00,510 --> 01:35:01,994
Sonic!

1143
01:35:05,579 --> 01:35:07,064
Robotnik!

1144
01:35:08,830 --> 01:35:10,022
Deceiver!

1145
01:35:10,105 --> 01:35:12,150
Die, mosquito.

1146
01:35:24,529 --> 01:35:25,705
I felt that.

1147
01:35:44,480 --> 01:35:45,939
What just happened?

1148
01:35:45,948 --> 01:35:49,378
It's the Stache Masher.
Right here in the manual.

1149
01:35:51,494 --> 01:35:53,905
Return to sender.

1150
01:36:01,628 --> 01:36:02,962
Stone?

1151
01:36:04,314 --> 01:36:08,730
Great. Next thing you know, there'll be
a report about a hostile work environment.

1152
01:36:11,495 --> 01:36:14,785
Those were our best attacks,
and they did nothing!

1153
01:36:14,880 --> 01:36:17,511
We can't beat Robotnik as
long as he's got that Emerald.

1154
01:36:17,513 --> 01:36:18,730
He's too powerful.

1155
01:36:18,772 --> 01:36:21,761
Look, we aren't strong enough
to beat Robotnik on our own.

1156
01:36:21,761 --> 01:36:23,189
But there's three of us.

1157
01:36:23,263 --> 01:36:26,430
Your strength, your smarts and my speed.

1158
01:36:26,522 --> 01:36:28,652
Together.
That's how we win.

1159
01:36:28,652 --> 01:36:32,964
So we make our stand here
on the field of battle.

1160
01:36:32,971 --> 01:36:34,203
As a team.

1161
01:36:34,621 --> 01:36:36,074
This is it.

1162
01:36:37,147 --> 01:36:40,089
This is our moment.

1163
01:36:41,855 --> 01:36:43,777
Time to fight.

1164
01:36:50,842 --> 01:36:54,550
Bad time to say this,
but I don't actually have a plan.

1165
01:36:55,321 --> 01:36:57,154
Tails, any ideas?

1166
01:36:57,230 --> 01:36:58,897
We have to find his weak spot.

1167
01:36:58,980 --> 01:37:00,605
I suggest the groin.

1168
01:37:00,607 --> 01:37:02,807
What? No. No!

1169
01:37:02,809 --> 01:37:05,527
Traditionally, yes,
the groin is the weakest spot.

1170
01:37:05,527 --> 01:37:07,691
Stop saying "groin."

1171
01:37:07,691 --> 01:37:09,246
Hedgehog!

1172
01:37:09,652 --> 01:37:10,816
Look out!

1173
01:37:13,714 --> 01:37:16,128
I know what his weak spot is.
It's me.

1174
01:37:16,230 --> 01:37:18,058
I'm the groin!

1175
01:37:20,808 --> 01:37:23,683
Think about it.
I live rent-free in this dude's head.

1176
01:37:23,683 --> 01:37:25,652
So if I go out there and rile him up...

1177
01:37:25,652 --> 01:37:28,041
He'll focus on only you,
leaving himself open

1178
01:37:28,041 --> 01:37:30,480
to a flanking maneuver
from me and the fox!

1179
01:37:30,480 --> 01:37:33,316
Hedgehog,
you are a brave and noble warrior.

1180
01:37:33,316 --> 01:37:36,007
Go to your certain death with honor.

1181
01:37:36,009 --> 01:37:38,707
We're gonna have to work
on your pep talks, pal.

1182
01:37:38,707 --> 01:37:40,668
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

1183
01:37:44,277 --> 01:37:45,724
All right, mustache.

1184
01:37:45,964 --> 01:37:48,564
You want me?
Come and get me.

1185
01:37:49,253 --> 01:37:51,522
You don't tell me
about coming and getting.

1186
01:37:51,605 --> 01:37:53,983
I am on the cutting edge
of coming and getting!

1187
01:37:53,983 --> 01:37:55,847
Coming, getting.

1188
01:37:55,849 --> 01:38:00,589
Coming, getting.
Coming, getting. Coming, getting.

1189
01:38:03,214 --> 01:38:05,003
You're really heavy.

1190
01:38:05,019 --> 01:38:08,019
That's because I am one
million percent muscle.

1191
01:38:08,026 --> 01:38:09,487
Faster, fox!

1192
01:38:11,030 --> 01:38:14,421
- Go! Move, guys! Move back!
- Let's go, that's it! Go, go, go!

1193
01:38:14,421 --> 01:38:15,483
- Keep going!
- Go! Go!

1194
01:38:15,483 --> 01:38:17,405
- No, no! Stop!
- Stop the truck!

1195
01:38:17,405 --> 01:38:19,147
Tom, what happened here?

1196
01:38:19,811 --> 01:38:22,202
- You thinking what I'm thinking?
- Let's get our kid.

1197
01:38:22,202 --> 01:38:23,483
- We need your truck!
- We need your truck!

1198
01:38:29,423 --> 01:38:31,944
Coming, getting.

1199
01:38:34,652 --> 01:38:36,757
So what's the plan here?

1200
01:38:37,287 --> 01:38:41,487
You gonna build a big robot house?
Get yourself a big robot wife?

1201
01:38:41,564 --> 01:38:46,139
I'm going to enslave humanity
and force them to service my machines.

1202
01:38:46,389 --> 01:38:48,821
First, Green Hills.
Then the universe.

1203
01:38:48,823 --> 01:38:50,124
Then the multiverse.

1204
01:38:50,230 --> 01:38:53,311
Then who knows?
Maybe that'll be enough.

1205
01:38:53,605 --> 01:38:55,179
Full disclosure?

1206
01:38:55,821 --> 01:38:58,600
You won't be there.

1207
01:39:03,436 --> 01:39:05,436
Eye lasers?
Really?

1208
01:39:17,585 --> 01:39:19,725
Snot rocket!

1209
01:39:21,064 --> 01:39:22,257
No, no, no!
No, no, no!

1210
01:39:30,605 --> 01:39:32,105
Giving up already?

1211
01:39:32,444 --> 01:39:36,421
Not so tough when you're fighting someone
700 times your size, are ya?

1212
01:39:38,063 --> 01:39:40,521
You can't beat me!

1213
01:39:40,811 --> 01:39:44,319
I'm all-powerful!
All-knowing!

1214
01:39:46,522 --> 01:39:48,897
All-seeing.

1215
01:39:49,655 --> 01:39:52,268
Looks like your fancy robot has a glitch.

1216
01:39:52,268 --> 01:39:54,062
Is it me? What about me?
I'm over here.

1217
01:39:54,062 --> 01:39:55,772
Up top! Down below!
Behind you!

1218
01:39:56,513 --> 01:39:58,599
I'm over here.
Sorry! Over here.

1219
01:39:59,121 --> 01:40:00,329
Too slow!

1220
01:40:00,355 --> 01:40:02,397
- You can't outsmart me.
- Missed me again.

1221
01:40:02,399 --> 01:40:04,489
I'm the outsmarter-er!

1222
01:40:08,686 --> 01:40:11,645
I didn't outsmart you.
I'm just the distraction.

1223
01:40:11,647 --> 01:40:12,939
Robotnik!

1224
01:40:13,486 --> 01:40:16,450
I am also a hologram.

1225
01:40:16,450 --> 01:40:18,355
Disloyal.

1226
01:40:18,439 --> 01:40:21,356
"Dis" is how I roll.

1227
01:40:49,819 --> 01:40:51,381
Where's my Emerald?

1228
01:40:52,020 --> 01:40:54,311
No, no, no, no!
No, no, no!

1229
01:40:54,311 --> 01:40:56,592
Computer, auxiliary power.

1230
01:41:05,605 --> 01:41:08,210
The Emerald.
It's right there.

1231
01:41:08,702 --> 01:41:10,795
Move, you hunk of junk!

1232
01:41:15,271 --> 01:41:18,331
I have to reach it.

1233
01:41:41,652 --> 01:41:43,082
Come on, come on, come on.

1234
01:41:44,951 --> 01:41:47,277
There he is! Go! Go, go, go!

1235
01:41:56,105 --> 01:41:57,183
No!

1236
01:41:57,183 --> 01:41:58,441
We got you, Sonic.

1237
01:41:59,714 --> 01:42:00,988
Hold on!

1238
01:42:14,104 --> 01:42:16,527
- You guys okay?
- Yeah.

1239
01:42:17,901 --> 01:42:18,808
Okay.

1240
01:42:24,355 --> 01:42:26,621
I got the Emerald.
We could still defeat him.

1241
01:42:26,621 --> 01:42:29,910
Come on, come on.
How does this thing work? What do I do?

1242
01:42:31,066 --> 01:42:32,130
What?

1243
01:42:32,689 --> 01:42:35,785
No. No, no, no, no!
No, no, no, no!

1244
01:42:39,388 --> 01:42:43,808
Look at the happy little family.

1245
01:42:49,142 --> 01:42:51,864
You have to get away from me.
I'm the one he wants.

1246
01:42:51,864 --> 01:42:52,897
Hey.

1247
01:42:53,483 --> 01:42:55,244
We're not going anywhere.

1248
01:42:55,620 --> 01:42:56,884
We're family.

1249
01:43:00,472 --> 01:43:02,525
And families stick together...

1250
01:43:04,994 --> 01:43:06,447
no matter what.

1251
01:43:09,272 --> 01:43:10,728
I love you guys.

1252
01:43:11,314 --> 01:43:13,189
We love you too, Sonic.

1253
01:43:21,355 --> 01:43:23,371
No!

1254
01:43:24,996 --> 01:43:27,425
I got him!

1255
01:43:27,467 --> 01:43:31,191
I finally got him!

1256
01:43:36,147 --> 01:43:38,121
What was that?

1257
01:44:23,732 --> 01:44:26,038
It's over, Eggman.

1258
01:44:27,355 --> 01:44:30,105
I like the new look.
It works for you.

1259
01:44:30,770 --> 01:44:33,770
What do you say
we just let bygones be bygones?

1260
01:44:33,772 --> 01:44:37,764
I did some things, you did some things.
There are good people on both sides.

1261
01:44:39,475 --> 01:44:43,030
Surely two intelligent beings

1262
01:44:44,064 --> 01:44:46,506
can work these things out!

1263
01:44:58,244 --> 01:45:00,522
- Come on, buddy. Come on.
- Get him, Sonic!

1264
01:45:00,605 --> 01:45:02,220
Yeah. Come on.

1265
01:45:19,146 --> 01:45:20,631
It's like that?

1266
01:45:21,651 --> 01:45:24,217
Okay, we're not friends.

1267
01:45:28,189 --> 01:45:30,967
Later, hater!

1268
01:45:41,855 --> 01:45:43,621
- Sonic!
- Buddy!

1269
01:45:43,897 --> 01:45:45,939
Wait! You cannot touch him!

1270
01:45:46,277 --> 01:45:49,011
The hedgehog holds
the power of the Emerald.

1271
01:45:49,405 --> 01:45:53,386
I am sorry.
He is no longer the Sonic you once knew.

1272
01:45:53,534 --> 01:45:54,534
What?

1273
01:46:14,545 --> 01:46:16,506
You got to try this.

1274
01:46:21,897 --> 01:46:25,230
Okay.
He is exactly the Sonic you once knew.

1275
01:46:27,105 --> 01:46:28,748
- Uh-huh.
- Uh-huh.

1276
01:46:37,034 --> 01:46:38,257
Sonic!

1277
01:46:40,490 --> 01:46:42,441
Bring it in, bud.

1278
01:46:43,730 --> 01:46:45,355
It's good to be back in blue.

1279
01:46:45,439 --> 01:46:48,772
The golden god thing was fun,
but blue has always been more my color.

1280
01:46:48,855 --> 01:46:49,939
Looks good on you.

1281
01:46:50,022 --> 01:46:55,738
Sonic, you were the most powerful hero
in the universe, and you let it go.

1282
01:46:55,738 --> 01:46:56,910
Why?

1283
01:46:58,393 --> 01:47:01,518
Because I still have
some growing up to do.

1284
01:47:03,730 --> 01:47:07,839
- And I kind of like being a kid.
- And you're not just any kid.

1285
01:47:08,145 --> 01:47:09,683
You're our kid.

1286
01:47:10,029 --> 01:47:11,293
That's right.

1287
01:47:11,522 --> 01:47:14,168
- Bring it in!
- Yay. Hugs.

1288
01:47:14,168 --> 01:47:17,207
It's a good thing we didn't do this before.
You would've blown up.

1289
01:47:24,892 --> 01:47:26,405
You fixed it.

1290
01:47:26,487 --> 01:47:29,821
I've spent my whole life
questing for this.

1291
01:47:29,897 --> 01:47:31,431
Now I have it.

1292
01:47:31,431 --> 01:47:33,064
Now we have it.

1293
01:47:33,147 --> 01:47:35,730
What do we do with it?
What next?

1294
01:47:35,814 --> 01:47:38,134
There were once two orders of heroes

1295
01:47:38,134 --> 01:47:42,462
who protected the galaxy from those
who would use the Emerald for evil.

1296
01:47:42,462 --> 01:47:46,619
But they have all passed on
to the great battleground in the sky.

1297
01:47:46,621 --> 01:47:49,649
So we start a new order.
The three of us.

1298
01:47:49,730 --> 01:47:51,439
This is no light task.

1299
01:47:51,522 --> 01:47:56,548
We must make a vow to use our powers
to keep the universe safe,

1300
01:47:57,022 --> 01:47:58,855
to watch out for each other.

1301
01:47:59,149 --> 01:48:00,654
Our new tribe.

1302
01:48:01,041 --> 01:48:01,855
I know!

1303
01:48:01,939 --> 01:48:04,642
- A power bump!
- Good idea.

1304
01:48:05,405 --> 01:48:08,947
It's an Earth custom.
An unbreakable promise.

1305
01:48:09,189 --> 01:48:10,480
Very well.

1306
01:48:11,272 --> 01:48:13,602
A power bump it is.

1307
01:48:14,862 --> 01:48:16,529
Power bump!

1308
01:48:20,439 --> 01:48:24,564
It's truly a beautiful day for baseball
here in Green Hills.

1309
01:48:24,647 --> 01:48:26,355
An exciting lineup today

1310
01:48:26,357 --> 01:48:29,955
with the debut appearance
of two new players!

1311
01:48:29,955 --> 01:48:33,987
On the mound,
rookie sensation from across the galaxy,

1312
01:48:34,071 --> 01:48:36,853
Miles "Tails" Prower,

1313
01:48:36,853 --> 01:48:41,853
facing off against the powerhouse,
Knuckles the Echidna.

1314
01:48:42,904 --> 01:48:44,779
I don't understand.

1315
01:48:44,862 --> 01:48:47,029
Why am I angry at the enemy ball?

1316
01:48:47,186 --> 01:48:48,353
You're not angry.

1317
01:48:48,362 --> 01:48:52,002
You just want to hit it as hard as you can
and then run around the bases.

1318
01:48:52,002 --> 01:48:56,673
But if my quest ends where I am standing,
why run at all?

1319
01:48:57,016 --> 01:48:59,564
I can't with this guy.
Why do I even try?

1320
01:48:59,564 --> 01:49:02,431
This is just a game.
We're out here having fun.

1321
01:49:02,431 --> 01:49:03,855
Just having some fun.

1322
01:49:04,134 --> 01:49:05,355
Fun.

1323
01:49:06,645 --> 01:49:09,189
All right!
Give him the heat, Tails!

1324
01:49:09,189 --> 01:49:11,072
Hope you're ready for my fastball.

1325
01:49:11,079 --> 01:49:13,494
Your fastball will be dishonored.

1326
01:49:13,651 --> 01:49:15,642
And so will you, fox.

1327
01:49:15,642 --> 01:49:18,439
- Easy, guys!
- Don't think about it too much.

1328
01:49:18,439 --> 01:49:21,986
Just keep your elbow up,
eye on the ball and give it a ride.

1329
01:49:21,986 --> 01:49:23,713
A ride? To where?

1330
01:49:27,522 --> 01:49:29,119
Power bump!

1331
01:49:34,162 --> 01:49:35,620
Victory is mine!

1332
01:49:35,622 --> 01:49:38,103
Hey, no fair!
That shouldn't count.

1333
01:49:38,103 --> 01:49:40,564
First base is also mine!

1334
01:49:40,900 --> 01:49:45,230
- I think that was our only ball.
- I have conquered the second of the bases!

1335
01:49:45,314 --> 01:49:46,986
Who wants ice cream?

1336
01:49:46,986 --> 01:49:48,147
Knocked the cover off that.

1337
01:49:48,149 --> 01:49:50,244
- Ice cream!
- Ice cream, yeah!

1338
01:49:51,479 --> 01:49:54,937
I am having the fun!
What is ice cream?

1339
01:49:55,275 --> 01:49:58,272
It's a dessert.
If you like fun, you're gonna love it.

1340
01:49:58,681 --> 01:50:01,775
Yum. Dessert.
Does it have grapes in it?

1341
01:50:01,775 --> 01:50:03,705
No, not usually.

1342
01:50:03,705 --> 01:50:05,213
I'm proud of our little guy.

1343
01:50:05,855 --> 01:50:09,197
I really like his new friends,
especially the red one.

1344
01:50:09,397 --> 01:50:12,022
- He cracks me up.
- Heck of a swing too.

1345
01:50:12,112 --> 01:50:14,862
Come on, fox.
Our dessert adventure awaits.

1346
01:50:14,864 --> 01:50:16,322
- Good job, guys.
- Yeah.

1347
01:50:16,362 --> 01:50:19,838
You too, baby. Let's go get some ice cream.
Come on, come on.

1348
01:50:20,896 --> 01:50:23,062
I'm happy for you, pal.

1349
01:50:23,064 --> 01:50:26,230
Got your wingmen.
Perfect friends to grow up with.

1350
01:50:26,314 --> 01:50:29,697
- Come on, Knuckles.
- My victory chariot!

1351
01:50:31,704 --> 01:50:34,541
I've got a lot more than that...
Dad.

1352
01:50:40,118 --> 01:50:41,451
Race you to the truck.

1353
01:50:43,105 --> 01:50:44,522
One, two, three, go!

1354
01:50:45,105 --> 01:50:47,230
No, don't go easy on me.
I want your best.

1355
01:50:47,322 --> 01:50:50,280
Sonic, I have just been told
they have sprinkles.

1356
01:50:50,355 --> 01:50:54,022
Ice cream and sprinkles?
This is your new destiny.

1357
01:50:54,556 --> 01:50:59,134
What a perfect meal to celebrate
my victory over you in base of ball.

1358
01:50:59,136 --> 01:51:02,205
- What?
- I mean, you barely beat me.

1359
01:51:02,405 --> 01:51:04,905
You've never been beaten so hard.

1360
01:51:09,376 --> 01:51:10,822
Can't forget this.

1361
01:53:09,937 --> 01:53:11,812
Agent, I want an update.

1362
01:53:12,018 --> 01:53:14,706
Still searching, sir.
We haven't found any sign of Robotnik.

1363
01:53:14,808 --> 01:53:17,147
No one could've survived that crash.

1364
01:53:17,230 --> 01:53:20,207
He's toast.
Good riddance.

1365
01:53:20,397 --> 01:53:23,147
What a mess that lunatic made.

1366
01:53:23,901 --> 01:53:27,050
Sir, there's something else.

1367
01:53:27,154 --> 01:53:30,696
When we were wiping Robotnik
off our database, we found something.

1368
01:53:30,772 --> 01:53:34,972
A file buried deep in our system
and dating back over 50 years.

1369
01:53:34,972 --> 01:53:37,530
- What was it?
- Coordinates, sir.

1370
01:53:37,647 --> 01:53:39,597
Coordinates? To what?

1371
01:53:40,230 --> 01:53:42,189
A secret research facility.

1372
01:53:42,837 --> 01:53:44,420
It was a black site, sir.

1373
01:53:45,147 --> 01:53:47,918
Someone worked very hard
to keep this hidden.

1374
01:53:48,980 --> 01:53:50,189
My God.

1375
01:53:51,147 --> 01:53:52,683
Project Shadow.
