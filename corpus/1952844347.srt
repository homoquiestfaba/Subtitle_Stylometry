1
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,634
- Hi.
- Hi.

2
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,360
- Sara Matthews.
- Sara Matthews.

3
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,273
You're in Room 316.

4
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,277
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

5
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,638
Bad driver. Hey. I'm Tracy.

6
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,672
Sara.

7
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,630
- Let me help you.
- Okay. Oh, thanks.

8
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,553
Hi.

9
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:01,915
It's great.

10
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,713
No, Mom, she's not here yet.

11
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,872
At least I got to pick
my side of the room though.

12
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,996
All right, I'll talk to you later.
I love you. Bye.

13
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,439
Hey. Tau Sigma Kappa's
throwing a bash. You have to come.

14
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,512
- I'm sorry, Tau--?
- They're a frat. You know, beer, guys....

15
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,035
You know, I think I'm gonna
wait for my roommate.

16
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,553
Come on! It's gonna be fun.

17
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,910
Me and Kim are coming.
Please, please, please.

18
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,195
All right.

19
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,398
- Cheers. Yes.
- College!

20
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,150
Did you see that guy?
He's checking you out.

21
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,478
Thank you. We're gonna take a break.
Someone get us a beer!

22
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,074
I'm gonna get some more punch.
You guys want some?

23
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,593
No, no, no. I'm good.

24
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,635
Oh, no. I am so sorry about that.

25
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,279
I really am sorry.

26
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,471
Whoa, wait. Where you going?

27
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,119
I'm feeling a little dizzy.

28
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,114
Let's find you a seat
and I'll grab you a towel.

29
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,798
- Here. Here you go.
- Thank you.

30
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,916
I'm gonna grab a beer.
Do you want one?

31
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,190
Oh, no, thanks.
I'm just having punch.

32
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,952
That might explain a few things.

33
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,838
We tend to spike the punch.

34
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,032
- You spike it?
- Yeah.

35
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:03,795
- Nice.
- When a girl has had three cups....

36
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,313
Four.

37
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,152
If we don't get her up into a room...

38
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:14,039
...we have to pull kitchen duty
for, like, a week.

39
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,997
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
I have to clean this up.

40
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,470
Plan didn't work.
I guess it backfired.

41
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,675
What plan?

42
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,037
I purposely spilled beer on you
to start a conversation.

43
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,676
- You purposely spilled beer on me?
- Yes, I did.

44
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:34,037
Sara! Sara!
I think you better come here.

45
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,509
- Take it off! Take it off! Take it off!
- Oh, no.

46
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,398
- Is she a friend of yours?
- Yes.

47
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,235
Take it off! Take it off! Take it off!

48
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,038
Tracy!

49
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,879
Shit.

50
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,196
- Yeah!
- I got her, I got her, I got her.

51
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,032
Get off of her. Get off her!

52
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:57,555
- Yeah, who's got you?
- I guess that would be me.

53
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,079
Yeah? Who's got you?

54
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,719
Apparently, God.

55
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,072
- You okay, Kim?
- Yeah, yeah.

56
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,510
- Oh, God! Oh, God!
- Okay, here we go.

57
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,559
Should we ride the elevator?

58
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,188
- All I had was punch.
- Here we go.

59
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,231
- You got her?
- Thanks, Sara. Okay.

60
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,358
Hey, you're that cute drummer guy
from that shitty band.

61
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,590
Oh, you're hot.

62
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,874
Yeah.

63
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:29,352
You know, I'm gonna get yelled at for
helping girls actually leave a frat party.

64
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,751
It's kind of like the opposite
of everything we stand for.

65
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,751
You know?

66
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,239
Good night.

67
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:53,757
- Wait.
- No, keep it. Save it till next time.

68
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:56,110
I'm sorry about kitchen duty.

69
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,750
I was just bullshitting you.

70
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,554
- Shit.
- Hi.

71
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:22,479
- Who are you?
- I'm your roommate, Rebecca.

72
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,796
Oh, God.

73
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,878
Rebecca?

74
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,993
Hey, Sara.

75
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,116
You met me last night.

76
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,349
Right.

77
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,351
Starts with an R.

78
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,192
Rebecca.

79
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:36,035
Here, take these. It'll help.

80
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,035
Thanks.

81
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,872
I didn't throw up on you, did I?

82
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,758
No.

83
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,551
Did you draw those?

84
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,674
- Very cool.
- Thank you.

85
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,877
Come on. Let's hit the bookstore.
The walk will help your head.

86
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,354
It's too early for me.

87
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,839
It's 3:00 in the afternoon.

88
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,913
Oh, God.

89
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,713
Jason, what are you doing?

90
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,235
I just wanted to hear your voice.

91
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,358
- I told you not to do this.
- I need to talk to you.

92
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,630
You're just making it harder.

93
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,394
Sara, listen,
I wanna come out there.

94
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:29,109
Yeah, but you didn't, remember?
That's the problem.

95
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,038
I gotta go.

96
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,276
That didn't sound good.

97
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,919
Was that your boyfriend?

98
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,957
Ex. It's complicated.

99
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,236
We were supposed to
go to college together.

100
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,914
We both applied to Brown,
and I got in but he didn't.

101
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,908
And I stuck to our agreement.
And we both committed to ULA.

102
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:50,072
And a couple of weeks ago,
a spot opens up at Brown, and--

103
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,753
- No.
- Yeah.

104
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,319
- He didn't.
- He did.

105
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,118
What an asshole.

106
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:58,795
- Do you miss him?
- Sometimes I think I do.

107
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:02,111
It's hard to let go.
Believe me, I know.

108
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:06,990
But you're in college now.
A girl's gotta move on.

109
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,957
Oh, my God.

110
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,270
- What?
- I am so jealous.

111
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,629
Yeah, I'm kind of a clotheshorse.

112
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,916
Actually, can I put some stuff
on your side?

113
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,315
- No problem.
- You can borrow anything you want.

114
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:24,836
- Some of this I've only seen in Vogue.
- My parents' idea of bonding...

115
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,190
...is setting me loose
with a platinum card.

116
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,351
- You're from here?
- Twenty minutes away.

117
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:33,035
That must be nice. Go home on the
weekends, free laundry, free meals.

118
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,310
- Yeah, not gonna happen.
- Why?

119
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,835
Let's just say
nothing is free in my house.

120
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,839
What is that?

121
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:43,794
Oh, it's nothing. It's just some ideas.

122
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,149
- It's good.
- Thanks.

123
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,868
Do you mind if I take a look
at what you were doing?

124
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,314
Actually, I do.

125
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,631
It's nothing personal.
It's just my process.

126
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:59,034
I wouldn't want you to look
unless it was perfect.

127
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,032
Okay.

128
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,509
Hey, Sara.

129
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,839
- Hey.
- Hey.

130
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,316
Tracy and Kim,
this is my roommate, Rebecca.

131
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,677
Rebecca. How formal.
What can we call you?

132
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,911
- How about Reba?
- How about Becca?

133
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,798
How about Becky?

134
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,991
- Becky's good.
- Yeah, Becky.

135
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,359
I like Rebecca.

136
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,318
Okay.

137
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,548
Well, I gotta go, guys. Bye.

138
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,558
Bye.

139
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,395
"Why should I turn off my BlackBerry
to listen to this guy?"

140
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,875
Because this class...

141
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,919
...will make you understand that
you're aspiring to do something great.

142
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,396
To emulate the likes
of Marc Jacobs...

143
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,949
...or Vera Wang, Rick Owens...

144
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,599
...perhaps even surpass them.

145
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,075
What you create
will be considered art...

146
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,879
...and don't let anyone
tell you differently.

147
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,709
The journey starts right here,
right now.

148
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,516
And it's my job...

149
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,355
...to make you understand
that each of you...

150
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,868
...can be artists.

151
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,591
- Professor Roberts?
- Yes?

152
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:21,071
I'm really sorry to bother you.
It's just, I must take this class.

153
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:24,033
I'm sorry, class is full.

154
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,915
Late girl, right? What's your name?

155
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,588
Sara Matthews.
I brought a request form.

156
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,912
And why should I sign your form, Sara,
when I've turned down a dozen others?

157
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,354
Would that be fair?

158
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,596
No, I guess it wouldn't.

159
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,076
Don't worry.
Intro Design has three other sections.

160
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:45,399
That's okay. I'll take it next year.

161
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,160
I wanna take your class. Thank you.

162
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,638
Sara.

163
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,195
You happen to have
two things I can't teach...

164
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,311
...and that is style and desire.

165
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,433
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

166
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,276
- Don't be late.
- I will not be late.

167
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,274
Who is that?

168
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:24,035
My friend Irene. She graduated from
The Art Institute out here last year.

169
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,315
She's an artist?

170
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:28,040
She used to be a design consultant
for Marc Jacobs.

171
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,633
"Paris was amazing."

172
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:33,110
"Milan in the fall."
And now she's off to Barcelona.

173
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,989
Hey. You guys free?
We're going to Seven Grand.

174
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,628
- How are we gonna get in?
- We're hot.

175
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,159
- You guys in?
- Sure.

176
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,671
Clubs aren't really my thing.

177
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:51,192
So, what should we wear?

178
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,832
Ladies!

179
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,958
From the two gentlemen
at the end of the bar.

180
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,555
Hey. Hi.

181
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,352
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

182
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,711
- Let's dance.
- Can I put these in your bag?

183
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,029
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

184
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,198
- Watch this guy hit on me.
- Yeah.

185
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,718
- Hi.
- Hi.

186
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,394
- How you doing?
- Good. What's your name?

187
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,278
- Adam.
- Hi. It's Tracy.

188
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:30,512
Tracy. I was watching you
from across the bar.

189
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,511
Tracy?

190
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,279
Damn, see her?

191
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,113
Yeah, I see her. She's hot.

192
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,789
Hello?

193
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:27,236
Would you accept a collect call
from Sara Matthews?

194
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,549
Yes.

195
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,435
Nice car.

196
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,949
- So where's Tracy?
- I have no idea.

197
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:56,472
Well, as long as I'm here....

198
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,995
- You hungry?
- I'm starving.

199
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,792
- Me too.
- Oh, good.

200
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,991
I can't believe she ran out on you.

201
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:06,630
- Thank you for coming.
- Of course. I was up.

202
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,151
- What are you having?
- Pancakes.

203
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,992
That's what I was thinking.

204
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,957
You know, tonight Tracy had her shot.
Tomorrow you're all mine.

205
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,156
I wanna show you the big city
the right way.

206
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,788
And I promise I won't abandon you.

207
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,309
- Sounds good. Deal.
- Good.

208
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,360
These are the modern pieces.

209
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,594
They're a little wilder
than the older stuff.

210
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,997
This is nice.

211
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,916
It's Jason again.

212
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,353
Come on,
I wanna show you something.

213
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,511
This is my favorite.

214
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,551
I love how he captures her personality
through her eyes.

215
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,439
It's like she really wants to help you.

216
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,676
It's amazing. I love it.

217
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,155
I'm so glad you liked it.

218
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:21,233
- It's not everyone's taste, you know?
- Yeah.

219
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,555
That's cool.

220
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,756
What, you don't have graffiti
in Des Moines?

221
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:27,520
Well, yeah. "Lana loves Kevin,"
"Stacy loves Robert."

222
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,079
But nothing like that.

223
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,515
Smile.

224
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,516
Come on, both of us.

225
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,871
Oh, now that is one art form
I don't get.

226
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,759
Needles in skin. No, thank you.

227
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,638
I have a tattoo.

228
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,279
- No, you don't.
- Yeah, I do.

229
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,953
It's my older sister.
She died when I was 9.

230
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,599
I'm sorry.

231
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:01,433
It's okay. This keeps her with me.

232
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,475
I always wanted a sister.

233
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,918
Come on.

234
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:16,111
Guess who I'm adding
as my new favorite artist.

235
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,709
Who?

236
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:20,835
Richard Prince.

237
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,955
The Devil Wears Prada
is your favorite movie?

238
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,235
Yeah, why?

239
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:28,677
Nothing. It's just not a classic is all.

240
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:29,955
I know that.

241
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:33,749
But it is about a small-town girl
making it in the fashion world.

242
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,279
- Like you.
- Yeah.

243
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,269
Hey there.

244
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,831
Look at you.

245
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,150
Hi, kitty.

246
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,231
Hi.

247
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,552
No collar, baby?

248
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,436
I thought you'd like it.

249
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,312
Sara?

250
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,393
I know, I know, I know.

251
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,949
I probably broke
about 40 different dorm rules...

252
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:29,237
...and I should just take it to a shelter,
but I just can't.

253
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,274
What should we name her?

254
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:41,114
- Really?
- It'll be our secret.

255
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:45,591
Well, I kind of already named her.
Cuddles.

256
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,273
Cuddles.

257
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,593
Sweetie.

258
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,955
Is that my necklace?

259
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,754
Sorry.

260
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,592
I was just trying it on.

261
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,430
It was my sister's.

262
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,471
You can borrow anything of mine
except for this.

263
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:11,513
It's the only thing I kept of hers.

264
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,949
I'm sorry.

265
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,630
It's okay. You didn't know.

266
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,914
Were you close to her?

267
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,151
Yeah.

268
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:32,151
You're the first roommate
I've had since she died...

269
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,996
...so it's a little odd.

270
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:40,037
In a good way or a bad way?

271
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,799
A good way.

272
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,677
Here you go.

273
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,839
Jake, do you mind?

274
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,833
- You wanted a mocha smoothie, right?
- Yeah.

275
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,518
Shit.

276
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:12,075
Now, there appears to be
a pattern forming here.

277
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:16,357
Just because I kissed you
doesn't mean I'll let you cut in line.

278
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,351
Then what does it mean?

279
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:23,355
Okay, so tonight,
the men of Tau Sigma Kappa...

280
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,875
...will be reviving a sacred tradition.

281
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,519
A frat party? I don't know.

282
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:31,031
Thank God. You're going to be
my excuse not to go.

283
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,555
- Am I gonna get my mocha?
- Yes.

284
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:36,518
Can you get him a mocha, please?
Thank you.

285
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,235
- Yeah. First day.
- All right.

286
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:42,995
- So I will see you tonight. Okay.
- Yes, you will. All right.

287
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:45,276
- Okay, bye. Bye.
- Bye.

288
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,552
Hey.

289
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,716
So Tau Sigma Kappa tonight?

290
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,713
- Kim and I are going.
- Why, so you can ditch me again?

291
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:03,117
Sara, the guy had a Porsche
and a hot tub.

292
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,475
That's your apology?

293
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,038
Listen, I-- Okay.

294
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,034
What I meant to say is I'm sorry.
I totally screwed up.

295
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,708
Forgive me? Please?

296
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,430
I forgive you.

297
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,279
Thank you.

298
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,273
- Hi.
- Hi.

299
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:39,432
- You look nice.
- Thank you.

300
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,756
Richard Prince is having
a showing tonight.

301
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:44,633
I bought two tickets,
since he's your favorite artist.

302
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,592
I-- I actually have a date.

303
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,117
Okay.

304
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,077
- I can reschedule.
- You don't have to.

305
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,794
I want to. Under one condition.

306
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,588
It's cute. Who's the designer?

307
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:11,593
Who cares?
What are you, a label whore?

308
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,552
I'm just curious.

309
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,797
I got it at a flea market for 20 bucks.
It's vintage.

310
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,791
One more thing.

311
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,956
Perfect.

312
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:31,476
I am jumping in the shower
and then we'll go.

313
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,552
Shit.

314
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,279
Rebecca.

315
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,513
- I gotta go that way.
- Okay.

316
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,632
- I'll see you later. Have a good day.
- Bye.

317
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,151
Hey, Sara.

318
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:05,149
Listen, something is up
with your roommate.

319
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,355
What do you mean?

320
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:07,999
She was outside my room
this morning.

321
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,798
Doing what?

322
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,475
Waiting for me.

323
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:15,474
I opened my door and there she was,
sitting there staring like some psycho.

324
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,355
Why would she do that?

325
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,796
You ask her.
I'm staying away from her.

326
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:24,040
Okay. I gotta go.

327
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,954
Contrary to popular opinion...

328
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:40,510
...beauty is not
in the eye of the beholder.

329
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,557
It's in the hands of the designer.

330
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:46,639
Now, tell me, looking at
these two options, which one's best?

331
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,711
Is there a right or wrong in fashion?

332
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,917
Who can tell me the difference
between fashion and style?

333
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,554
Miss Matthews?

334
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,555
Fashions fade, but style is eternal.

335
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:02,716
Yves Saint Laurent. Exactly.

336
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:06,233
All the money in the world
can't buy you style.

337
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,834
But it can buy you a good stylist.

338
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,836
Touché.

339
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,719
Hi.

340
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,074
Hi. Thank you.

341
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,556
How'd you know what time
my class got out?

342
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,711
I'm your roommate.

343
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,800
Tracy said something about
you scared her.

344
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,871
- What?
- Yeah.

345
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,913
No. It's more like she scared me.

346
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,719
She was racing to the bathroom
like she was gonna hurl.

347
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,399
She practically knocked me over.

348
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,596
Well, the girl does love to party.

349
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,512
Anyway, I wouldn't worry about it.

350
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,234
I gotta go meet Irene.
Thanks again for the coffee.

351
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,112
- Sara!
- Hey.

352
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,272
- Irene!
- Finally!

353
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,759
- Hi.
- Hi.

354
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,271
- Sit, sit, sit.
- Okay.

355
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,432
I so wanna be you when I grow up.

356
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,160
- Hell, I wanna be me when I grow up.
- Irene. Ready?

357
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:21,909
Two seconds. Your dad keeps leaving
me messages. Like, four this week.

358
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,833
I hope you told him I'm closing
the library every night.

359
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,629
I told him I haven't seen you.
For all I know, you could be a crack ho.

360
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,792
- Perfect.
- All right, you're done.

361
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:36,629
- Thank you for coming.
- Of course. I wouldn't miss it.

362
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,118
I haven't seen you around much.

363
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,470
Since you blew me off
for dinner and all.

364
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,995
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

365
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:59,596
Actually, I was thinking
maybe dinner tonight?

366
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,513
I'm studying, so....

367
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,597
- Oh, I see.
- Yeah. Yeah.

368
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,671
- Page 3.
- It's very dense.

369
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,558
Right.

370
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:14,434
All right. All right. Let's go.

371
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,831
- Okay.
- Let's go quick...

372
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,831
...before I change my mind.

373
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,557
Goddamn it.

374
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:30,077
Hey! How about
turning on the light?

375
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,031
Hello?

376
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,676
I know it's you.

377
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,197
Bitch.

378
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,632
Freak.

379
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,159
You wanna know what I think?

380
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:19,199
I think you're a trashy,
little party-going whore.

381
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:22,148
And you are a bad influence on her.

382
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,989
You tell anyone about this
and I will kill you.

383
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,519
Okay.

384
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,713
Okay.

385
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,996
Nice belly ring.

386
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:09,634
Hey, it's Sara. Leave a message.

387
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:16,516
Well, thank you
for helping me not study.

388
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:17,914
Oh, any time.

389
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,911
Yeah?

390
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:24,191
Where were you?

391
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,593
Hi.

392
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:30,911
I kept on calling and calling.

393
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:34,637
- Rebecca, this is Stephen.
- I'm going to bed now.

394
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,916
I'm glad you're okay.

395
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:47,316
- You got a curfew?
- No.

396
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,071
I guess she's right.
I should have called.

397
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,429
Okay.

398
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,998
Good night.

399
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:10,115
- I'll see you later.
- Sara.

400
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,111
Last night,
I was just worried about you.

401
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:18,916
You don't need to worry about me.
I can take care of myself. Okay?

402
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,754
- We're good, right?
- Yeah, we're good.

403
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,037
- I'm already her best friend?
- It's kind of sad.

404
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,315
Stop it.

405
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:41,312
Maybe she really likes you.

406
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,232
- You know what I mean?
- No, I don't.

407
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,192
- No?
- No.

408
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:48,158
- I think you do.
- You are a moron.

409
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,313
Thank you.

410
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,231
Stephen.

411
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:12,115
Tracy. Tracy.

412
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,435
Hey.

413
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,755
- Hey.
- I heard you changed dorms.

414
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:21,710
Yeah. Conrad Hall,
it seemed like a better vibe, so....

415
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:24,917
- We should get together. Grab a bite.
- Sara.

416
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,353
Hi.

417
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,108
Tracy.

418
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,388
What was that all about?

419
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:35,950
I don't know. She just walked off.

420
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:39,279
Well, she's always been a flake.

421
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,994
- It's not a great view.
- No, it's not. It's all right.

422
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:47,152
It's all right. Yeah.
It's about a six out of 10.

423
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,277
- I give it a four.
- A four?

424
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,272
That's quite critical of a view.

425
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,999
- So?
- So?

426
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,474
Should we--? Should we go home?

427
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,636
- Yes, we should.
- Yeah.

428
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,791
But the question is:

429
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:08,474
My place or yours?

430
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,795
- Okay.
- Yes, and I'll make you a bet.

431
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,036
- Okay.
- Okay.

432
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,794
A, we go to your place.

433
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:21,153
B, you take me home...

434
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:24,995
...to my twin bed and roommate.

435
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,151
What's the bet?

436
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:34,154
This is kind of a stupid bet.

437
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,839
Why did you agree?

438
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,673
Apparently, I'm kind of a stupid guy.

439
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,512
Oh, don't touch the ground.

440
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,355
Don't touch your feet.

441
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,990
All right, you win.

442
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:53,149
- So....
- So we go to your place.

443
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,958
So.

444
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:02,077
- Wait a second.
- What?

445
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,873
Can you give me 30 seconds?

446
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,837
- You're kidding me.
- No, I'm not.

447
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:08,235
Thirty seconds. Thank you.

448
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,557
Almost there.

449
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:15,757
I'm just gonna have to start
taking my clothes off out here.

450
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,558
Yeah, right.

451
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:20,439
- Oops, there goes my shirt.
- I don't believe you.

452
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:23,876
- There go my jeans.
- Damn it, that is my striptease. Stop it.

453
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:26,230
What's next? Top or bottom?

454
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:29,552
You know, I'm just gonna
make you strip all over again.

455
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,392
I knew you didn't have...

456
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,278
...the guts.

457
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,752
Sara, you answered.

458
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,319
Sara?

459
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:21,039
Sara. It's Jason.

460
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:25,151
Can we talk...

461
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:27,755
...about us?

462
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,798
Sara?

463
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,951
I miss you.

464
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,751
You do?

465
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:51,114
I miss touching you.

466
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,957
Do you miss touching me?

467
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,832
Yes.

468
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:03,151
Prove it.

469
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,471
Jason.

470
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,671
I miss you so much.

471
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:00,639
Don't ever call me again.

472
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:02,671
What?

473
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:10,553
- Don't ever call me again.
- Wait, Sara, what do you mean? I--

474
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:14,715
Good morning.

475
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:19,076
Hi. You're up early.

476
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:20,549
Yeah.

477
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,915
Sorry I didn't call. I left my phone.

478
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:25,073
No problem.

479
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:28,232
Hello, Cuddles. Hi, kitty.

480
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:31,278
Do you wanna get some breakfast?
Oh, no.

481
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,748
- Is this your cat?
- Maybe.

482
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,151
- She's cute.
- Thanks.

483
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,233
And if you keep her, I lose my job.

484
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:48,432
- Do we understand each other?
- Yes.

485
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:54,040
Hey. Come in.
What took you so long?

486
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,429
I walked.

487
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:57,875
- You didn't.
- I did. Cabs are too expensive.

488
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:01,396
Sara, you can't just go walking around
downtown in L.A. by yourself.

489
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:03,437
- This is not Des Moines.
- I know.

490
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:05,158
The city is full of crazies.

491
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:07,436
Let me make us one drink
and then we'll go.

492
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,272
Hello?

493
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,431
Yeah, that's a great idea. Hang on.

494
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:14,273
- Hey, Irene, do you like cats?
- Yeah. Why?

495
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:16,635
- We need to get rid of one.
- I travel too much.

496
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:19,912
- The thing would starve to death.
- You're right. No, she can't.

497
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:23,274
I'll be home when I'm home.

498
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:24,915
Bye. It's all right.

499
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:26,399
- Who was that?
- My roommate.

500
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,955
- She can be overprotective.
- That sounds fun.

501
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:32,351
- So where is it?
- Where's what?

502
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,431
You said you had a surprise for me?

503
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:36,511
Oh, yeah.

504
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,951
So I was cleaning out my closet...

505
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:44,790
...and I have not worn any of this
in the last six months.

506
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:48,236
- You're kidding me. All of this?
- There's more.

507
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:50,639
- Oh, no.
- What?

508
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,870
We don't have a lot
of closet space...

509
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:55,270
...and Rebecca's already taking
half my side.

510
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:57,590
Just move in with me.

511
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:00,439
- Seriously?
- Yeah, why not?

512
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:02,517
This place is huge. I'm never home.

513
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:06,275
Ditch that roommate of yours
and live here.

514
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:08,112
Besides, you can have pets.

515
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:10,038
- I'll talk to her about it.
- Good.

516
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:17,871
Irene really likes the girls.

517
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:19,871
Always has.

518
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,634
It's too bad she couldn't
take Cuddles, huh?

519
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:25,273
That might not be a problem.

520
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:27,198
Really?

521
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:29,157
She suggested I move in with her.

522
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:30,509
What?

523
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:33,274
- You wanna move?
- No. I--

524
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:35,911
I love living here with you.

525
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:40,719
I'd still technically be living here, so
you wouldn't need another roommate.

526
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:42,274
Her place is huge.

527
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:45,040
It's not like you couldn't use
the extra closet space.

528
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:48,033
I don't want more space, I want....

529
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:54,354
It's just something to think about.

530
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:57,391
Nothing's set in stone.

531
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:00,873
Plus, we'd be able to keep Cuddles.

532
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:04,831
Yeah, well, I was thinking maybe
I'd stay here for Thanksgiving...

533
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,230
...and see you guys at Christmas.

534
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:09,709
You know what, Mom?
I'm really swamped right now.

535
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:13,395
Could I call you guys back?
Okay. Bye.

536
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:48,109
Feel how nice and warm
it is in there?

537
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:56,874
Oh, my God. What's wrong?

538
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:01,438
- Cuddles got out.
- What?

539
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:04,558
I took her with me to do laundry
and she was in the basket...

540
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:07,638
...and she ran off.
And I went after her but....

541
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:08,915
I'm sorry.

542
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:13,638
I'm gonna go find her.

543
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:24,629
Maybe it's karma. We weren't allowed
to keep her anyway.

544
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:29,160
- It's all my fault.
- It was an accident.

545
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:31,595
It's just stress after stress,
you know?

546
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:36,153
Is there something else wrong?

547
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:42,833
My parents really want me
to come home for Thanksgiving.

548
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,149
And you don't wanna go?

549
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,915
Emily died two days
before Thanksgiving.

550
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:52,119
It hasn't always been the most festive
holiday in the Matthews household.

551
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:54,794
I know I should be there,
but, I don't know...

552
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:58,157
...it's like there's a ghost
at the table, you know?

553
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:01,713
So....

554
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,149
You can come with me.

555
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,831
Spend Thanksgiving at my house.

556
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:11,679
- Your folks wouldn't mind?
- Please.

557
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:14,229
Stephen also asked me to stay...

558
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:16,670
...but thank you.

559
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:19,349
Midterm designs are due Friday.

560
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:22,999
Now, remember, people: simplicity.

561
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:25,515
Who is the founder of our industry?

562
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:29,318
Eve. When she handed Adam
the fig leaf.

563
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:32,551
Have a good day.

564
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:36,992
- Sara.
- Yeah?

565
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:40,193
- Can I see you in my office?
- Sure.

566
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:45,352
I love the danger in your work.
It's kinky and edgy.

567
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:48,870
I love the fact that there's all these,
like, dark recesses in this...

568
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:52,396
...innocent exterior. The juxtaposition
is awesome. That's great.

569
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,551
- Thank you.
- And I mean, styles, you know--

570
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:57,757
They change so rapidly
in the fashion world.

571
00:46:58,040 --> 00:47:01,749
Because you got your particular cut,
your technique, you know, the--

572
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:04,270
Which is what makes it
so amazing and exciting.

573
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:08,195
Exactly. Which is why I go
to fashion week every year in Paris.

574
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:12,754
To catch up on what's fresh
and amazing and.... What else?

575
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,558
- Exciting.
- Exciting.

576
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:17,234
- And, let's face it, to go to the parties.
- Sure.

577
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:21,029
The budget allows for me
to bring an assistant every year.

578
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:24,596
Usually it's a senior, but not always.

579
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:27,753
There's a lot of talent in this class...

580
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:32,596
...but the best designers push
the boundaries on what's acceptable.

581
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:35,315
They take chances.

582
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:47,238
I should go.

583
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:49,277
All right. Well, good meeting.

584
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:53,239
The offer still stands, Sara.

585
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:54,589
Chance of a lifetime.

586
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:05,640
- What's wrong?
- My design professor just kissed me.

587
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:10,475
- Are you all right?
- And I think the asshole's married.

588
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:16,830
- Are you gonna tell Stephen?
- No, that'll just cause problems.

589
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:22,077
I'm here for you.

590
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:25,118
- I know.
- Thank you for telling me.

591
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:31,433
- What can I do?
- Nothing.

592
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:43,870
- Professor Roberts?
- That's right.

593
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:45,877
I'm glad you're still here.

594
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:48,799
Yeah, well, I was just leaving.

595
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:54,236
- You're not a student of mine.
- No, not yet.

596
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:57,151
That's why I'm here.

597
00:48:57,840 --> 00:49:00,308
- I'm failing Intro Psych.
- Yeah, and why is that?

598
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:02,829
I'm bored.

599
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:06,635
Well, I'm real sorry about that,
but I don't know what I can do to help.

600
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:10,190
Tomorrow is the last day
to drop a course.

601
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:14,911
If I don't add another one in its place,
then I'll fall way behind in credits.

602
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:18,397
Daddy won't take that very well.

603
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:20,712
He might even pull the plug...

604
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:24,873
...which means I'm pretty much
at your mercy.

605
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:28,839
Look, I really don't take--

606
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:32,549
It's not my policy to take on students
in the middle of the term.

607
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,756
Do I look like
just any student to you?

608
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:41,830
- Oh, your wife's very pretty.
- Oh, it's my ex-wife.

609
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:46,631
I might have to ask you
a few questions first.

610
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:49,715
- Ask me anything.
- You have design experience?

611
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:54,153
- None.
- What do you know about clothes?

612
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:58,356
Only one thing.

613
00:49:58,560 --> 00:49:59,879
Yeah, and what's that?

614
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:04,752
I look better out of them
than in them.

615
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:08,469
Well, I think we can work
something out.

616
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:12,630
- Just tell me and I'll do anything.
- Kiss me.

617
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:16,918
- What?
- I said kiss me.

618
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:27,395
Professor Roberts,
you're hurting me.

619
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:38,394
Oh, you little tease.

620
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:44,994
Get off of me! Stop it! Stop!

621
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:46,269
- Quiet!
- No!

622
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:49,438
- Shut up! Quiet!
- Get off of me! Stop! Leave me alone!

623
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:52,114
- You're hurting me!
- Quiet. Shut up, would you?

624
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:55,079
- No! I said no!
- Shut up, you little bitch tease!

625
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:57,430
Sylvester, stop it! No!

626
00:50:57,640 --> 00:51:00,632
- Quiet! Quiet!
- Get off of me! No! I said no!

627
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:02,958
- What--?
- Stop!

628
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:09,955
- Just tell me and I'll do anything.
- Kiss me.

629
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:14,432
- What?
- I said kiss me.

630
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:17,714
What do you want?

631
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:20,678
- Professor Roberts, you're hurting me.
- Give me that!

632
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:26,039
You don't have to do this.
You don't have to do this.

633
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:28,111
What do you want? Okay, come on.

634
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:33,271
- I'll pay for it. All right, I'll pay for that.
- Yes, you will.

635
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,797
Come on in.

636
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,991
Come on in. Hello.

637
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:48,552
Just take your seats, please.
Welcome.

638
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:51,558
I'm Professor Jacobs
and I'll be taking over the class...

639
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:53,318
...for the rest of the semester.

640
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:54,869
What happened?

641
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:57,508
They're calling it a leave of absence,
but I heard...

642
00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:00,877
...someone sent the dean a recording
of him hitting on a student.

643
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:03,713
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah, I know.

644
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:05,029
I know.

645
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:07,350
Well, that's what you call
instant karma.

646
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:44,719
- Bye, Sara.
- Bye, Jake.

647
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:48,354
Okay, I have made a decision.

648
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:50,352
- You ready?
- Yeah, let's hear it.

649
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:52,558
All right.

650
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:54,791
- I'm gonna quit the band.
- What? Why?

651
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:57,758
It's a huge waste of time
and we suck.

652
00:52:57,960 --> 00:52:59,791
I disagree,
but why would you say that?

653
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:01,916
All right, let me think about this.

654
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:05,470
The only places
that we can get booked...

655
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:09,235
...are my frat house
and my girlfriend's coffee shop.

656
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:10,435
That's not good.

657
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:14,115
- Did you just say "my girlfriend"?
- Oh, you heard me.

658
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:22,078
So do you think it'd be fun
to stay here for Thanksgiving?

659
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:25,596
Yeah, you know, you got dinner
at the frat house, football games...

660
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:28,951
...and the always awkward
homoerotic humor.

661
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:32,430
- That sounds like a blast. It's fun times.
- Oh, yeah. It's very good.

662
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:34,949
A little awkward at times, but....

663
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:48,198
Rebecca. Oh, my God.
What happened?

664
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:52,478
- What happened?
- I was looking for Cuddles.

665
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:57,553
A man pulled me into an alley.
And he--

666
00:54:57,720 --> 00:54:58,914
Okay.

667
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:01,435
- I got away, though.
- Okay.

668
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:03,192
Okay.

669
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:09,715
Oh, my God.

670
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:14,080
It's not deep, thank God.

671
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:16,117
You should see a doctor.

672
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:18,595
- No.
- Rebecca, you need to.

673
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:21,399
- And then the police.
- No, I can't.

674
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:24,353
You're calling or I am.
There is a psycho walking around.

675
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:27,080
- Please, I didn't even see him.
- It doesn't matter.

676
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:30,710
- You still need to talk to the police.
- Please. I only want you to know.

677
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:33,599
- Rebecca.
- Don't tell anybody, please.

678
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:36,228
Okay, I won't tell them.

679
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:43,074
- Just let me help you.
- Are you mad at me?

680
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:46,758
Why would I be mad at you?

681
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:52,949
Sorry again about not staying,
but Rebecca....

682
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:54,752
No, I get it. I get it.

683
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:59,073
I'm just gonna make out with my pillow
and pretend it's you anyway, so....

684
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:01,153
Just say you're gonna miss me.

685
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:03,315
I will miss you.

686
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:07,036
I'll miss you too.

687
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:19,269
You know, I haven't heard from Jason
in weeks.

688
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:21,632
It's weird how he stopped calling.

689
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:23,832
That's what you wanted, right?

690
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:26,959
Yeah.

691
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:29,950
Yeah, I guess it is.

692
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:39,753
This is your home?

693
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:43,629
This is my parents' house.
It was never a home when I lived here.

694
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,150
Hello?

695
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:03,790
Is anybody here?

696
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:09,515
Hi, Rebecca.

697
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:11,838
- Hi.
- Hi, honey.

698
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:14,514
- Oh, my God. What happened?
- Mom, stop. Nothing.

699
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:17,399
- What do you mean? It's not nothing.
- Leave it alone.

700
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:21,358
We didn't think you'd make it.

701
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:23,397
Why wouldn't I?

702
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:27,915
And you are?

703
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:29,915
I'm Sara.

704
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:32,515
- Sara's my roommate.
- Hi, I'm Jeff.

705
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:36,195
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi. Welcome. I'm Alison.

706
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:38,038
Thanks.

707
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:40,191
Come on, let me show you my room.

708
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:48,834
You didn't tell them
we were coming?

709
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:51,708
They didn't need to know.

710
00:57:58,040 --> 00:58:00,634
- Nice room.
- I guess.

711
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:09,913
- Who is she?
- That's just some high-school work.

712
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:13,755
I haven't gotten around
to taking it down yet.

713
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:17,237
Sara, I hope you're not a vegetarian.

714
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:19,237
Oh, no, not at all.

715
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:29,236
- Rebecca's an awesome roommate.
- That's nice to hear.

716
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:33,319
I'm sure she likes you, because she's
never brought anyone home before.

717
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:35,391
- Dad.
- What?

718
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:37,596
As a parent, you worry.

719
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:41,548
You protect your daughter all her life
and then she goes off to college.

720
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:45,230
And she's on her own. And you
never know who she'll be exposed to.

721
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:46,719
Dad.

722
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:52,593
Sara, we're going to make up
a very nice room for you.

723
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:54,432
No, she'll stay with me.

724
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:56,591
- Right?
- Okay.

725
00:58:57,240 --> 00:58:59,117
Wonderful.

726
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:12,073
Dad.

727
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:15,712
Bec. You scared me.

728
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:18,712
Why are you up so late?

729
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:34,633
- So how you doing?
- I'm fine.

730
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:38,270
My grades are good.

731
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:41,158
That's not what I meant.

732
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:43,151
I'm making friends.

733
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:47,993
Rebecca, look at me for a second.

734
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:55,311
Your mother and I
are very fond of you.

735
00:59:55,480 --> 00:59:57,277
I know.

736
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:01,997
All right,
I'm gonna head on up to bed.

737
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:12,159
Hi.

738
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:14,195
What are you up to?

739
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:16,669
Rebecca's gonna show me
her high-school hangouts.

740
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:19,030
- Wonderful.
- Yeah.

741
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:22,033
- Rebecca's doing really well.
- She's doing good.

742
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:24,153
She's taking her medication?

743
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:28,157
Medication?

744
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:32,279
Well, you girls have
a wonderful time.

745
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:36,038
Come on.

746
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:47,190
Is everything okay?

747
01:00:48,360 --> 01:00:49,918
Yeah.

748
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:52,597
It's just....

749
01:00:53,720 --> 01:00:56,598
It's nice to see
where you come from.

750
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:00,309
Come on.

751
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:06,749
- This is the best.
- Smells really good.

752
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:09,356
I used to come here, like, every day.

753
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:16,079
- It's Rebecca.
- Well, just stay out here.

754
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:25,598
Do you know them?

755
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:28,430
That'll be 5.57.

756
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:38,594
That's the girl from your drawings.

757
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:42,279
Rebecca?

758
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:44,429
Let's leave.

759
01:01:51,360 --> 01:01:53,237
Hi, Maria.

760
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,115
Hi.

761
01:01:56,280 --> 01:01:58,111
I wanted to introduce you to Sara.

762
01:01:59,640 --> 01:02:01,437
My roommate.

763
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:05,431
- Hi.
- Hey.

764
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:15,111
Maybe we should go.

765
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:21,159
Rebecca.

766
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:28,717
We were never friends.

767
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:36,276
Come on, let's go.

768
01:02:58,320 --> 01:03:01,198
Oh, good, Irene's back in town.

769
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:20,675
- Good run?
- Great.

770
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:23,431
I'm going to the studio.

771
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:25,192
All right, I'll catch you later.

772
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:28,597
Don't wait up. I feel inspired.

773
01:03:40,560 --> 01:03:42,710
I forgot my pad.

774
01:03:44,600 --> 01:03:46,238
Bye.

775
01:04:18,320 --> 01:04:20,390
- Hey.
- Oh, my God.

776
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:23,390
- You all right?
- Hi.

777
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:27,592
- You all right?
- Yeah.

778
01:04:28,120 --> 01:04:31,271
- What are those?
- That's what I gotta find out.

779
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:48,038
Hey.

780
01:04:51,160 --> 01:04:52,957
Can I help you out?

781
01:04:54,840 --> 01:04:57,479
No. I'm fine.

782
01:05:01,960 --> 01:05:03,632
Just doing my job.

783
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:08,678
- All done.
- You have a little something.

784
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:15,637
- What the hell?
- I'm sorry, Rick.

785
01:05:15,800 --> 01:05:18,439
Sweetheart, it's okay. No harm, no--

786
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:22,993
I'm so sorry again, Rick.

787
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:24,949
You spoiled bitch.

788
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:28,149
Be cool.

789
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:31,118
Come on!

790
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:35,835
Pussy.

791
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:44,998
It says Zyprexa is used to treat the
symptoms of psychotic conditions...

792
01:05:45,160 --> 01:05:48,516
...such as schizophrenia
and bipolar disorder.

793
01:05:48,680 --> 01:05:51,035
I just thought she was weird.

794
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:55,988
Maybe this is a refill. Maybe she's
been taking them the whole time.

795
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:58,469
Yeah, I don't think
she's ever taken them.

796
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:02,355
I think it's time
to move in with Irene.

797
01:06:02,680 --> 01:06:04,113
Yeah.

798
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:45,155
Sorry to stare...

799
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:47,432
...but you're really beautiful.

800
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:49,435
So are you.

801
01:06:56,600 --> 01:07:00,593
You have great lips.
What kind is that?

802
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:02,955
Cinnamon. Caffeinated.

803
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:05,794
A girl never knows
how late she's gonna party.

804
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:11,277
Can I try?

805
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:42,830
You're right. Cinnamon.

806
01:07:46,360 --> 01:07:51,639
I would invite you back to my place,
but I have a roommate.

807
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:58,318
Well, as luck would have it,
I'm only a few blocks away...

808
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:00,596
...and I don't.

809
01:08:03,360 --> 01:08:05,794
What are we waiting for?

810
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:21,995
It's Irene. Please leave a message.

811
01:08:39,840 --> 01:08:41,398
Hi.

812
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:46,476
- Where were you all night?
- I was at the studio.

813
01:08:46,680 --> 01:08:49,035
I got inspired, so....

814
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:51,031
I just lost track of time.

815
01:08:56,920 --> 01:08:58,911
- Rebecca--
- I want a tattoo.

816
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:00,594
- What?
- A tattoo.

817
01:09:00,840 --> 01:09:02,558
Will you come with me?

818
01:09:02,720 --> 01:09:05,598
Please? I don't think
I could do it without you.

819
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:10,712
Okay.

820
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:25,556
I know what I want.

821
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:30,711
- I'll wait here.
- Okay.

822
01:09:44,920 --> 01:09:46,592
All done.

823
01:09:48,120 --> 01:09:49,439
Let's see it.

824
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:01,397
You can think of me as your sister.

825
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:06,559
Well, what's the matter?

826
01:10:12,280 --> 01:10:14,748
You can call me Emily if you want.

827
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:23,151
Sara?

828
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:34,036
- That's all you're bringing?
- I'll get the rest when Irene comes back.

829
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:36,953
- Where's your necklace?
- I can't find it. It's okay.

830
01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:39,918
- Sara.
- Stephen, I don't wanna go back there.

831
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:43,397
I'm gonna go look for it.

832
01:10:58,320 --> 01:10:59,833
Have you seen Sara's necklace?

833
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:05,999
What did I do?

834
01:11:06,160 --> 01:11:09,835
She just needs to move on.
You know?

835
01:11:12,920 --> 01:11:14,035
With you?

836
01:11:18,200 --> 01:11:21,431
If you find the necklace,
just let me know. All right?

837
01:11:24,240 --> 01:11:26,674
You do shit like that.

838
01:11:28,040 --> 01:11:29,075
Have a good one.

839
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:32,234
We should call someone.

840
01:11:32,440 --> 01:11:35,193
Like the dean's office,
or at least your R.A.

841
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:37,874
And tell them what?
She hasn't done anything to me.

842
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:40,031
That girl's own parents
are afraid of her.

843
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:43,670
- She sure scared the shit out of me.
- Are these clean or dirty?

844
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:48,873
Somewhere in between, maybe.

845
01:11:55,720 --> 01:11:57,392
Did you take this?

846
01:11:57,560 --> 01:11:58,993
No. I don't think so.

847
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:03,474
Is that not yours?

848
01:12:10,520 --> 01:12:13,637
That's enough. I'm returning this,
and you gotta do something.

849
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:16,633
No. I don't want you
to go back there.

850
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:40,513
Hey, it's Sara. Leave a message.

851
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:43,314
Hey, Sara. It's Jason.

852
01:13:44,320 --> 01:13:47,835
I'm actually in front of your dorm.
I just flew in.

853
01:13:48,680 --> 01:13:51,672
Look, I'm at the Rosewell Hotel,
Room 210.

854
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:53,717
Call me, okay?

855
01:14:03,200 --> 01:14:05,236
I'm going to the library.

856
01:14:05,480 --> 01:14:08,040
- I can walk you.
- It's okay.

857
01:14:08,200 --> 01:14:10,031
- Are you sure?
- Yep.

858
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:14,990
Well, the party starts at 10. I did hear
that there is a great band playing.

859
01:14:15,160 --> 01:14:18,232
- I thought you said they suck.
- They're getting better, you know?

860
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:20,755
- I hear the drummer's really hot.
- He is.

861
01:14:20,920 --> 01:14:23,753
But I'm sleeping with his girlfriend.

862
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:26,910
- I'll see you later.
- Okay.

863
01:14:55,440 --> 01:14:57,158
Sara?

864
01:16:55,760 --> 01:16:57,398
What?

865
01:17:01,720 --> 01:17:03,358
Sara?

866
01:17:05,800 --> 01:17:07,916
You got my voice mail.

867
01:17:09,320 --> 01:17:10,878
I'm glad you came.

868
01:17:11,040 --> 01:17:13,190
That feels good.

869
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:19,397
Turn over.

870
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:24,393
Close your eyes.

871
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:27,550
Oh, I missed your smell.

872
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:29,709
I love you so much.

873
01:17:31,120 --> 01:17:33,236
She doesn't love you.

874
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:14,555
Hey, it's me. Irene needs me
and she's not answering her phone.

875
01:18:14,720 --> 01:18:17,473
And I'm really worried.
Will you meet me there, please?

876
01:18:17,640 --> 01:18:20,473
524 South Grand. Okay. Bye.

877
01:18:58,480 --> 01:19:00,311
Irene?

878
01:19:34,160 --> 01:19:35,309
Irene?

879
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:38,516
- Irene!
- Sara.

880
01:19:40,360 --> 01:19:43,955
- What are you doing?
- Sit down and shut up.

881
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:50,156
Listen to me.

882
01:19:52,040 --> 01:19:54,156
All I ever wanted was
to be your friend.

883
01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:56,550
- Rebecca, I am your friend.
- No, you're not.

884
01:19:56,720 --> 01:19:59,029
- Yes, I am.
- No. You're not!

885
01:19:59,200 --> 01:20:01,760
We're here
because you betrayed me.

886
01:20:03,160 --> 01:20:04,832
- Rebecca, I'm your friend.
- Stop!

887
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:08,276
Stop saying things you don't mean!

888
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:09,708
I protected you!

889
01:20:09,880 --> 01:20:13,429
I protected you
against that whore Tracy...

890
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:16,114
...and that nasty little kitten...

891
01:20:16,280 --> 01:20:19,033
...that scumbag of a professor...

892
01:20:19,360 --> 01:20:22,272
...even that loser ex-boyfriend
of yours!

893
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:25,392
- What did you do to him?
- I got rid of them all for you!

894
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:29,030
And how do you repay me?
By leaving me!

895
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:32,272
Rebecca, please forgive me.

896
01:20:32,480 --> 01:20:33,629
Okay?

897
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:40,077
I'm sorry. I am so sorry.
From the bottom of my heart.

898
01:20:40,240 --> 01:20:41,275
Please forgive me.

899
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:49,268
I forgive you.

900
01:20:50,760 --> 01:20:52,591
Okay.

901
01:20:52,760 --> 01:20:54,876
Now we can start all over again.

902
01:20:55,120 --> 01:20:56,633
Okay.

903
01:20:57,280 --> 01:20:59,430
Just like that first day.

904
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:03,434
- What is that?
- Just the two of us together.

905
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:05,238
Because I only want you...

906
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:08,790
- ...to have one best friend.
- No! No! No!

907
01:21:09,040 --> 01:21:11,235
- Rebecca! Rebecca, don't!
- Lay still, bitch.

908
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:15,313
Stay away! Don't come any closer.

909
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:17,431
- Stop!
- Irene?

910
01:21:19,120 --> 01:21:21,554
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

911
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:26,472
Sara.

912
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:45,313
Sara! Sara!

913
01:21:45,520 --> 01:21:46,635
Sara!

914
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:49,633
- Irene!
- Sara, no!

915
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:53,958
- Sara! Sara! Sara, no! Sara!
- Shit!

916
01:21:54,120 --> 01:21:56,429
- The fire escape!
- I just want to be your friend!

917
01:21:56,640 --> 01:21:58,358
- I can't leave you!
- Go to the window.

918
01:21:58,600 --> 01:22:01,512
Sara! Sara!

919
01:22:02,160 --> 01:22:04,151
- Shit!
- No, Sara!

920
01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:06,595
Sara! Open it, please!

921
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:09,155
- Sara!
- I can't reach it! It's too far!

922
01:22:10,680 --> 01:22:13,069
- Sara, go! Get out!
- Sara!

923
01:22:22,360 --> 01:22:24,032
- Sara!
- Oh, God. It's too far.

924
01:22:25,680 --> 01:22:27,193
Everything is gonna be okay!

925
01:22:27,880 --> 01:22:29,711
Sara!

926
01:22:36,600 --> 01:22:38,716
Help me!

927
01:22:43,640 --> 01:22:44,834
Help me!

928
01:22:45,640 --> 01:22:47,312
No!

929
01:22:48,240 --> 01:22:49,559
Help!

930
01:22:50,640 --> 01:22:52,437
Oh, my God!

931
01:22:55,040 --> 01:22:57,190
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Get me up!

932
01:22:57,360 --> 01:22:58,998
- Give me your hand.
- Pull me in!

933
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:04,755
Sara! Look out!

934
01:23:05,640 --> 01:23:07,198
Oh, my God!

935
01:23:08,360 --> 01:23:09,952
Oh, my God.

936
01:23:10,160 --> 01:23:11,718
- Sara!
- Oh, shit.

937
01:23:12,640 --> 01:23:14,676
Come on.

938
01:23:19,080 --> 01:23:20,911
Stephen. Stephen.

939
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:31,795
I swear to God...

940
01:23:32,280 --> 01:23:34,669
- ...I will shoot you, Rebecca.
- You won't do it.

941
01:24:26,480 --> 01:24:28,471
You were never my friend.

942
01:26:34,840 --> 01:26:37,991
- Welcome back.
- Hi.

943
01:26:38,160 --> 01:26:40,390
You know, you can move in with me
if you want.

944
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:42,596
I don't think I want a roommate
for a while.

945
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:43,994
Yeah.

946
01:26:45,920 --> 01:26:48,150
- Dinner tonight, maybe?
- Absolutely.

947
01:26:48,360 --> 01:26:49,793
Okay.

948
01:26:50,360 --> 01:26:53,955
But before you go, do you want
to help me with a little something?

949
01:27:07,280 --> 01:27:09,077
Get out of here.

950
01:27:11,400 --> 01:27:13,277
See you later.
