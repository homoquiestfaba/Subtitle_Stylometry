Kiki, you are a lifesaver.

I know. But thanks for saying so, Sam.

19
00:01:43,803 --> 00:01:46,405
[chuckles] So, why the early call-in?

20
00:01:46,472 --> 00:01:50,509
Oh, we'll soon find out, but
the Turk case is my guess.

21
00:01:50,576 --> 00:01:51,911
Hopefully, Monty will wanna build

22
00:01:51,978 --> 00:01:53,646
a strategy before the weekend.

00:01:53,713 --> 00:01:56,616
Girl, I cannot wait to
see the look on their faces

00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:00,920
- Uh-huh.
- Thank you, truthsayers.

26
00:02:02,321 --> 00:02:05,191
[sighs] I have a really
good feeling about this one.

27
00:02:05,258 --> 00:02:07,860
I think Monty might let me
lead the charge for once.

28
00:02:07,927 --> 00:02:10,363
Ooh, girl, it's about time.

29
00:02:10,429 --> 00:02:13,232
Forging my path to partner.

30
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:15,067
You got everything loaded on to the tablet?

31
00:02:15,134 --> 00:02:17,069
Um, multiple photos, the articles?

32
00:02:17,136 --> 00:02:18,671
- Mm-hmm, got it all.
- Thank you, Kiki.

33
00:02:18,738 --> 00:02:21,307
I don't know what I would do without you.

34
00:02:21,374 --> 00:02:22,642
How many minutes do I have left?

35
00:02:22,708 --> 00:02:24,577
- Exactly three.
- How do I look?

36
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:27,680
- Ooh, like a future partner.
- Mm-hmm.

37
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:30,149
Let's get right to it.

38
00:02:30,216 --> 00:02:34,587
As you know, uh, this is a
very high profile case for us.

39
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:38,257
So I need you to bring your A-game.

40
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:40,326
Taz, my man.

41
00:02:40,393 --> 00:02:42,228
- Let's do the walk-through.
- My pleasure.

42
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:46,766
Our client, the all pro
wide-out for this great city...

43
00:02:46,832 --> 00:02:48,034
Always comes
through for fantasy...

44
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:50,269
Hey, and, and, might I add,

45
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:51,971
just released a new line of tequila

46
00:02:52,038 --> 00:02:54,607
that has proceeds going
to At-Risk Teens...

47
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:56,842
- Get on with it.
- [Taz] Okay.

48
00:02:56,909 --> 00:03:00,079
Our guy, Jaden Turk, meets
a young, poor waitress

49
00:03:00,146 --> 00:03:02,782
at a well-known, upscale restaurant.

50
00:03:02,848 --> 00:03:04,717
Now, not much out of the ordinary,

51
00:03:04,784 --> 00:03:06,452
except, he's married at the time.

52
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:09,388
And now his ex-wife wants a
substantial amount of alimony

53
00:03:09,455 --> 00:03:12,825
for all her pain and suffering.
That's where we come in.

54
00:03:12,892 --> 00:03:15,127
Our client is only willing
to pay the bare minimum.

55
00:03:15,194 --> 00:03:17,596
He believes that his
ex-wife is an opportunist.

56
00:03:17,663 --> 00:03:19,098
[scoffs] A what now?

57
00:03:19,165 --> 00:03:21,901
He claims that she agreed
to an open marriage,

58
00:03:21,968 --> 00:03:24,203
and is using this as a
get-rich-quick scheme.

59
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:26,072
Is he willing to negotiate
something, anything?

60
00:03:26,138 --> 00:03:28,274
Mm, it's gonna be a tough sell.

61
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:30,543
You see, basically, Mr. Turk believes

62
00:03:30,609 --> 00:03:33,145
he's the victim in all this.

63
00:03:33,212 --> 00:03:34,380
Jim?

64
00:03:34,447 --> 00:03:35,715
What about a-a nice hefty

65
00:03:35,781 --> 00:03:37,483
upfront settlement for a little

66
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,318
smoothing over, and maybe that way

67
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:41,721
the monthly alimony
won't have such a sting?

68
00:03:41,787 --> 00:03:43,222
Sam, what about you? Thoughts.

69
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:46,959
Well, I say, before we settle on anything,

70
00:03:47,026 --> 00:03:50,029
we see exactly what her pain
and suffering has looked like.

71
00:03:50,096 --> 00:03:52,798
I have a suspicious feeling
Mrs. Turk hasn't been curled up

72
00:03:52,865 --> 00:03:55,034
in a ball, crying her eyes out at home.

73
00:03:55,101 --> 00:03:57,303
- And why's that?
- Well...

74
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:00,039
She doesn't look so distraught here.

75
00:04:00,106 --> 00:04:03,943
- And this was five days ago.
- Hm.

76
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:05,978
I'm not saying I approve
of what Jaden Turk did,

77
00:04:06,045 --> 00:04:09,181
but come on, you marry a star athlete,

78
00:04:09,248 --> 00:04:10,883
you typically know what comes with that.

79
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:12,318
Come on! I mean...

80
00:04:12,385 --> 00:04:15,054
E-everybody deals with
grief in different ways.

81
00:04:15,121 --> 00:04:18,124
Hell, when my wife left
me, I was dancing for joy.

82
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:19,992
The judge isn't gonna
give that a second thought.

83
00:04:20,059 --> 00:04:22,695
[Taz] Yeah, but it helps
tame the dollar signs.

84
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:24,830
Mm, that it does.

85
00:04:24,897 --> 00:04:26,799
I like it.

86
00:04:26,866 --> 00:04:28,668
Jim, you take lead on this.

87
00:04:28,734 --> 00:04:30,369
Take Taz, talk to our client,

88
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:32,138
see what you can find
through his financials.

89
00:04:32,204 --> 00:04:36,475
The rest of us, time for
a weekend strategy session.

90
00:04:36,542 --> 00:04:39,545
I know it's short notice,
but I wanna go over

91
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:41,514
every possible angle

92
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:45,351
her attorneys might throw at us.

93
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:49,188
The, uh, the partners are
vested in this one. Sound good?

94
00:04:49,255 --> 00:04:51,157
- [Jim] It sounds good.
- Great.

95
00:04:54,894 --> 00:04:57,329
Monty, what the hell?

96
00:04:57,396 --> 00:04:59,665
I just offered up a game-changer.

97
00:04:59,732 --> 00:05:03,035
- And I'm more than capable...
- I know you are, Sam.

98
00:05:03,102 --> 00:05:06,205
I just feel that the client
would be more comfortable

99
00:05:06,272 --> 00:05:08,340
with Jim and Taz at this particular moment.

100
00:05:08,407 --> 00:05:11,677
- Because they're men?
- No, not at all.

101
00:05:11,744 --> 00:05:13,979
It's just a gut feeling.

102
00:05:14,847 --> 00:05:15,815
We're a team.

103
00:05:15,881 --> 00:05:19,518
Remember, he wins, we all win.

104
00:05:20,553 --> 00:05:22,922
Get current, Monty.

105
00:05:22,988 --> 00:05:24,156
Women are capable of more than

106
00:05:24,223 --> 00:05:25,925
just picking up your dry-cleaning.

107
00:05:25,991 --> 00:05:29,295
[chuckles] Bye, Sam.

108
00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:36,001
Sammy, what happened in there?

109
00:05:36,068 --> 00:05:37,636
What always happens.

110
00:05:37,703 --> 00:05:39,138
I gave Monty a solid play

111
00:05:39,205 --> 00:05:41,040
and he hands it off to Jim and Taz.

112
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:43,109
Oh, it's a damn boy's club in this office.

113
00:05:43,175 --> 00:05:45,544
- That's no secret.
- And we're working this weekend.

114
00:05:45,611 --> 00:05:48,414
Again! Building the
strategy I just gave them.

115
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:53,052
Mm-mm. Wait, what about taking
Tony to the lake this weekend?

116
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:00,259
Canceled.

117
00:06:01,627 --> 00:06:05,531
[sighs] I tell you,
between my angry teenager

118
00:06:05,598 --> 00:06:09,201
and these law jocks every single day...

119
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:14,507
it's easy to lose sight of the purpose.

120
00:06:16,475 --> 00:06:20,079
it's like I'm losing myself, you know?

121
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:22,748
I know things have been
really hard for you, uh,

122
00:06:22,815 --> 00:06:24,617
especially with the divorce.

123
00:06:24,683 --> 00:06:28,287
But forget about those guys.

124
00:06:28,354 --> 00:06:33,025
Kiki is here, and I think
tonight's the best night

125
00:06:33,092 --> 00:06:35,995
for a best friend's girls' night!

126
00:06:36,061 --> 00:06:37,463
We'll dance at Al,
we'll have some drinks...

127
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:40,132
I can't, I need to spend time with Tony,

128
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:43,435
especially if I'm busy all weekend.

129
00:06:43,502 --> 00:06:46,238
Besides, I honestly
don't know if I remember

130
00:06:46,305 --> 00:06:48,874
how to socially interact with people.

131
00:06:48,941 --> 00:06:50,109
Can I ask you a question?

132
00:06:50,176 --> 00:06:52,044
Do you honestly know

133
00:06:52,111 --> 00:06:53,979
whether you remember how to

134
00:06:54,046 --> 00:06:57,183
shake, shake, shake that ass, girl?

135
00:06:57,249 --> 00:07:00,920
I know you can shake,
shake, shake it, girl.

136
00:07:04,523 --> 00:07:05,925
[Sam] Tony?

137
00:07:08,727 --> 00:07:10,829
- Tony?
- Yeah, mom.

138
00:07:10,896 --> 00:07:13,332
- Yeah, what?
- Don't "what" me.

139
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:15,534
There's no maid service here.

140
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:18,704
Hey, mom, what time are we leaving

141
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:21,540
for the lake house tomorrow?
I invited Rick and Steve.

142
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:22,808
- Is that okay?
- No.

143
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:25,044
It's not okay because it was supposed

144
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:27,746
to just be you and me
spending time together.

145
00:07:27,813 --> 00:07:31,550
But it doesn't matter. I
have to work this weekend.

146
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:33,686
Okay, well, can me and the guys still go?

147
00:07:33,752 --> 00:07:35,221
I'm gonna be 18 in a few months.

148
00:07:35,287 --> 00:07:36,922
It'll be good practice for letting go some.

149
00:07:36,989 --> 00:07:40,159
But you're not 18 yet, and
I'm still responsible for you.

150
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:42,328
Come on, mom, please.
No parties, I promise.

151
00:07:42,394 --> 00:07:45,030
Forget it, Tony. The answer is no.

152
00:07:45,097 --> 00:07:46,465
What is the point of us having a lake house

153
00:07:46,532 --> 00:07:48,067
if we never go? You work all the time.

154
00:07:48,133 --> 00:07:50,202
And if I don't work, how do you expect me

155
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:52,605
to pay for your video
games, your lacrosse trips?

156
00:07:52,671 --> 00:07:54,340
Whatever. I'll just go
to dad's for the weekend.

157
00:07:54,406 --> 00:07:57,142
Oh, so you wanna go to
your dad's on our weekend?

158
00:07:57,209 --> 00:08:00,479
At least I have an actual
life. Some actual fun.

159
00:08:00,546 --> 00:08:03,482
Well, if that's what
you wanna do, Tony, fine.

160
00:08:03,549 --> 00:08:05,284
I won't stop you.

348
00:19:54,192 --> 00:19:58,396
[coughs] That is stronger
than I remember from college.

349
00:19:58,463 --> 00:20:00,031
[coughing]

350
00:20:00,098 --> 00:20:04,970
- It's good stuff.
- Oh... college.

351
00:20:06,338 --> 00:20:09,240
So many lifetimes ago.

352
00:20:09,307 --> 00:20:12,877
I got pregnant in college with my son.

353
00:20:14,779 --> 00:20:16,648
And now he's graduating from high school

354
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:21,786
and he'll be off himself soon.

355
00:20:22,988 --> 00:20:26,625
God. I won't know what to do without him.

356
00:20:26,691 --> 00:20:29,661
He's, he's my entire life,

357
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:33,098
you know, outside of my work.

358
00:20:33,164 --> 00:20:37,435
And the kicker is, he blames
me for the divorce. Hm.

359
00:20:38,837 --> 00:20:41,973
If he only knew it was his father,

360
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:45,944
he's the one who checked
out a long time ago...

361
00:20:47,012 --> 00:20:50,048
betrayed the family.

362
00:20:50,115 --> 00:20:52,751
And then there's the guys at work.

363
00:20:52,817 --> 00:20:55,020
Not a respectable bone in any of 'em.

364
00:20:55,086 --> 00:20:57,689
Like, right now we're working
a really high-profile case...

365
00:20:57,756 --> 00:20:59,391
I can't say who it is.

366
00:20:59,457 --> 00:21:00,525
[whispers] Jaden Turk.

367
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:02,827
[chuckles]

368
00:21:02,894 --> 00:21:04,462
Oh, God, I shouldn't have said that.

369
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:08,700
I-I'm just rambling, but it
feels so good to unload and...

370
00:21:25,316 --> 00:21:26,951
[sighs]

371
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:33,992
[cell phone ringing]

372
00:21:40,565 --> 00:21:42,133
This is Samantha Connelly.

373
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,436
[dramatic music]

374
00:21:44,502 --> 00:21:46,805
Yes, I can talk right now.

375
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:51,176
How did you get my personal number?

376
00:21:53,178 --> 00:21:55,980
Well, long story short,
another woman is threatening

377
00:21:56,047 --> 00:21:58,917
to step forward that she
and Mr. Turk had relations

378
00:21:58,983 --> 00:22:00,418
while he was still married.

379
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:02,887
That just adds fuel to Mrs. Turk's fire.

380
00:22:02,954 --> 00:22:04,589
- Any truth to it?
- [Taz] Turk says no.

381
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:06,458
But does it matter?

382
00:22:06,524 --> 00:22:08,326
[Jim] Like I said from the
beginning, let's figure out

383
00:22:08,393 --> 00:22:10,528
a nice settlement and make
this all go away. I mean...

384
00:22:10,595 --> 00:22:12,964
- This is a waste of time.
- [Sam] No. It's not.

385
00:22:13,031 --> 00:22:14,766
We, as his team, aren't here to judge

386
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:16,601
what Mr. Turk did in his past.

387
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:19,804
We are here to get him the best
possible deal moving forward.

388
00:22:19,871 --> 00:22:21,773
That? How do you propose
that? Another ya...

389
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,075
Excuse me, I'm speaking.

390
00:22:25,577 --> 00:22:28,079
Did you know that Jaden
supported her entire family

391
00:22:28,146 --> 00:22:30,415
while married, and still does?

392
00:22:30,482 --> 00:22:32,183
Actually, helping her two younger brothers

393
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:34,819
through college right now.

394
00:22:34,886 --> 00:22:38,089
Why didn't we know any of this?

395
00:22:38,156 --> 00:22:40,959
Jaden didn't wanna drag her family into it.

396
00:22:41,025 --> 00:22:43,328
- He cares about them.
- It doesn't matter.

397
00:22:43,394 --> 00:22:46,397
What Turk does with her
family is his own choice.

398
00:22:46,464 --> 00:22:48,266
It has got nothing to do with her.

399
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:51,169
Did you speak with our client directly?

400
00:22:51,236 --> 00:22:54,873
He reached out to me. Check my call log.

401
00:22:54,939 --> 00:22:58,943
He said this whole thing
lacked a female's touch.

402
00:23:00,211 --> 00:23:01,980
Shall I move forward, Monty?

403
00:23:02,046 --> 00:23:04,616
Please. Yes.

404
00:23:04,682 --> 00:23:07,819
[chuckles] More than makes
up for you skipping out

405
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:09,521
on our weekend session.

406
00:23:13,992 --> 00:23:17,395
That's what I'm talking about, boys.

407
00:23:18,163 --> 00:23:19,998
Where are your balls?

408
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:21,833
Not in this room!

409
00:23:23,468 --> 00:23:24,836
Okay...

410
00:23:26,337 --> 00:23:28,006
Oh. Sam, I've been dying to
share this recipe with you.

411
00:23:28,072 --> 00:23:29,440
It's called Hong Kong Milk Tea Tiramisu

412
00:23:29,507 --> 00:23:31,242
and I know you love
Beltane. If you love it...

413
00:23:31,309 --> 00:23:33,478
Um, I've gotta take this.

414
00:23:37,482 --> 00:23:39,317
- Uh. Hello?
- [Giselle on phone] Hey.

415
00:23:39,384 --> 00:23:41,719
I'm in the lobby. Can you come out?

416
00:23:41,786 --> 00:23:43,621
You're here? In my lobby?

417
00:23:43,688 --> 00:23:46,424
Yeah, I was in the neighborhood.

418
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:49,360
Be right out.

419
00:24:00,238 --> 00:24:02,574
That's a nice color on you.

420
00:24:03,541 --> 00:24:04,676
Thank you.

421
00:24:04,742 --> 00:24:06,845
So, how are you?

422
00:24:06,911 --> 00:24:10,648
[chuckles] I'm having the best day.

423
00:24:10,715 --> 00:24:11,683
Yeah?

424
00:24:11,749 --> 00:24:14,919
I'm the new lead on a big case.

425
00:24:14,986 --> 00:24:17,889
After I left the other
night, our client calls

426
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:20,091
completely out of the blue.

427
00:24:20,158 --> 00:24:22,260
He's not satisfied with the
other attorneys on the team,

428
00:24:22,327 --> 00:24:26,531
but he's willing to give us
another shot if I take the lead.

429
00:24:26,598 --> 00:24:30,835
Because he was looking
for a female's touch?

430
00:24:30,902 --> 00:24:32,470
Yes.

431
00:24:33,771 --> 00:24:36,875
Wait. You know Jaden Turk?

432
00:24:36,941 --> 00:24:39,677
Please, if you have a nice
set of tits in this town,

433
00:24:39,744 --> 00:24:43,181
you're Jaden Turk's
friend. Everyone knows that.

434
00:24:43,248 --> 00:24:46,517
You called him. Why?

435
00:24:46,584 --> 00:24:49,654
When I look at you, I see two women.

436
00:24:49,721 --> 00:24:53,224
One, successful, driven.

437
00:24:53,291 --> 00:24:57,595
The other, lonely, scared...

438
00:24:58,363 --> 00:24:59,564
beatdown.

439
00:25:03,134 --> 00:25:05,970
You're a strong, beautiful woman.

440
00:25:06,037 --> 00:25:08,039
Always remember that.

441
00:25:09,274 --> 00:25:11,209
Now, can you get out of here?

442
00:25:11,276 --> 00:25:12,777
I have a little surprise planned.

443
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:15,513
I promised my son I'd
drop his gear at practice.

444
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:17,982
- I can meet you after.
- I don't mind.

445
00:25:18,049 --> 00:25:20,685
- I'd love to meet Tony.
- [chuckles]

446
00:25:20,752 --> 00:25:23,621
How do you know my son's name?

447
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:26,658
Must've been all that pillow talk.

448
00:25:32,597 --> 00:25:33,731
[car honking]

449
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,236
Bro. Mom, what the hell?
I'm late for practice.

450
00:25:38,303 --> 00:25:39,904
Do you know how many
laps I'm gonna have to do?

451
00:25:39,971 --> 00:25:43,408
[Sam] Don't start. You know
how traffic gets at this time.

452
00:25:47,578 --> 00:25:49,547
- Hey.
- Hi.

453
00:25:49,614 --> 00:25:51,716
[Sam] Well, son, when are
you coming home? Thursday?

454
00:25:51,783 --> 00:25:54,052
Uh, I-I can come home tonight if you want.

455
00:25:54,118 --> 00:25:55,620
Is your, um, i-is your
friend staying for...

456
00:25:55,687 --> 00:25:58,690
Tony. Thursday. Come home after school.

457
00:25:58,756 --> 00:26:01,392
...to bring you anything
home? Do you like wine or...

458
00:26:01,459 --> 00:26:04,696
Tony, I thought you said
you were late for practice.

459
00:26:04,762 --> 00:26:06,297
It-it was nice meeting you.

460
00:26:06,364 --> 00:26:09,534
[chuckles] See you Thursday!

461
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,503
- Cute kid.
- [groans] I'm sorry.

462
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:16,107
He's not the brightest in
the bunch, but a good kid.

463
00:26:16,174 --> 00:26:19,644
- You have any?
- Me? No. No, no kids.

464
00:26:19,711 --> 00:26:23,881
But it must be nice.
Close family, big house.

465
00:26:23,948 --> 00:26:27,452
[sighs] Well, as they say,
the grass is always greener.

466
00:26:27,518 --> 00:26:31,089
Hm. Not from where I'm sitting.

467
00:26:33,691 --> 00:26:36,627
[instrumental music]

468
00:26:44,369 --> 00:26:47,672
Ooh, I love this piece.
Like, a little red bra...

469
00:26:47,739 --> 00:26:49,140
[indistinct chatter]

470
00:26:49,207 --> 00:26:51,909
This is really pretty on your skin color.

471
00:26:51,976 --> 00:26:53,177
[indistinct chatter]

472
00:26:53,244 --> 00:26:54,979
- They have another color!
- Yes.

473
00:26:55,046 --> 00:26:58,116
[indistinct chatter]

474
00:27:00,084 --> 00:27:01,486
That's perfect.

475
00:27:03,154 --> 00:27:07,091
[Giselle] Damn! You look good.

476
00:27:07,158 --> 00:27:09,460
I love it!

477
00:27:11,362 --> 00:27:13,097
Oh, wow. I can't afford this.

478
00:27:13,164 --> 00:27:15,733
Oh, I know that you can afford this.

479
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:20,538
Fancy job, rich ex-husband.
Not everyone gets that.

480
00:27:20,605 --> 00:27:22,507
Yeah, you're forgetting a house mortgage,

481
00:27:22,573 --> 00:27:24,842
son going to expensive university.

482
00:27:24,909 --> 00:27:27,044
I'm just saying you're worth it.

483
00:27:27,111 --> 00:27:29,247
Are you not worth it?

484
00:27:31,482 --> 00:27:33,284
Well, say it with me.

485
00:27:34,018 --> 00:27:35,453
I'm worth it.

486
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:39,223
I'm worth it.

487
00:27:39,924 --> 00:27:43,161
Yes. Work it.

488
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:53,471
If it's too much for you, I'll
gladly put a few things back.

489
00:27:55,072 --> 00:27:56,474
Excuse me, sweetheart?

490
00:27:56,541 --> 00:27:58,776
Just trying to be helpful, ma'am.

491
00:28:01,446 --> 00:28:03,247
And you were saying?

492
00:28:04,615 --> 00:28:06,350
- [hanger clatters]
- Oops!

493
00:28:06,417 --> 00:28:09,921
- Giselle.
- Stop or I'll call the police.

494
00:28:09,987 --> 00:28:11,456
And say what?

495
00:28:11,522 --> 00:28:14,659
Someone dropped a blouse
on the floor? Go ahead.

496
00:28:14,725 --> 00:28:18,162
But at the end, you'll
still have to pick it all up.

497
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:22,300
Stop.

498
00:28:22,366 --> 00:28:25,670
Or you can politely apologize

499
00:28:25,736 --> 00:28:28,206
to my friend here.

500
00:28:28,272 --> 00:28:30,708
No. I didn't do anything.

501
00:28:30,775 --> 00:28:31,976
Oh, but you did.

502
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:34,445
You're just too
inexperienced to realize it.

503
00:28:34,512 --> 00:28:37,115
Um, let's just finish the
transaction and go, hm?

504
00:28:37,181 --> 00:28:41,252
So you can go home and write
a strongly-worded Yelp review?

505
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:44,822
If you do that, this little shit wins.

506
00:28:48,092 --> 00:28:50,461
Don't ever disrespect me again.

507
00:28:50,528 --> 00:28:52,563
Or any woman that's
paying money to this shop

508
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:55,199
that supplies your paycheck.

509
00:28:56,868 --> 00:28:58,336
I'm sorry.

510
00:29:00,538 --> 00:29:05,810
Now, don't we all feel a lot better?

511
00:29:07,111 --> 00:29:08,513
Yes.

512
00:29:14,585 --> 00:29:17,788
Thank you. Have a lovely day.

513
00:29:27,031 --> 00:29:29,734
- Come on, don't be a baby!
- [Sam grunts]

514
00:29:33,137 --> 00:29:35,206
[Sam] Whoo!

515
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:36,841
Oh! I don't know how you do it.

516
00:29:36,908 --> 00:29:38,543
- What, tequila?
- No.

517
00:29:38,609 --> 00:29:40,177
You don't care about consequences.

518
00:29:40,244 --> 00:29:42,079
You do whatever you want.

519

00:40:17,981 --> 00:40:19,917
I should not be here.

696
00:40:21,251 --> 00:40:23,020
Relax.

697
00:40:23,086 --> 00:40:26,156
You're just a sexy
woman having a good time.

698
00:40:27,257 --> 00:40:31,161
- Are you crazy?
- Honestly, Samantha.

699
00:40:31,228 --> 00:40:33,230
If Jaden invited one of the male attorneys,

700
00:40:33,297 --> 00:40:35,966
you don't think they'll be here?

701
00:40:36,033 --> 00:40:38,602
Don't be so naive.

702
00:40:38,669 --> 00:40:42,606
Do you know how many
friends Jaden Turk has?

703
00:40:42,673 --> 00:40:45,175
High-profile friends?

704
00:40:45,242 --> 00:40:48,312
You're here networking. Seize it.

705
00:40:49,112 --> 00:40:50,647
Damn it. You're right.

706
00:40:50,714 --> 00:40:53,951
I'm tired of picking up after other people.

707
00:40:54,017 --> 00:40:56,486
It's time I put myself first for once.

708
00:40:56,553 --> 00:40:57,888
Yes.

709
00:40:59,122 --> 00:41:01,258
Who the hell are you?

710
00:41:01,325 --> 00:41:05,262
The question is, who are you?

711
00:41:05,329 --> 00:41:07,531
- [upbeat music]
- Let's find out.

712
00:41:10,434 --> 00:41:11,435
Okay!

713
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:36,526
[music continues]

714
00:42:02,653 --> 00:42:05,055
What did you say your name was, again?

715
00:42:05,122 --> 00:42:07,057
It doesn't even matter.

716
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,137
[music continues]

717
00:42:33,116 --> 00:42:34,951
Hey, what? What?

718
00:42:35,018 --> 00:42:38,255
I'm sorry. I-I have to go.

719
00:42:40,357 --> 00:42:43,493
[indistinct chatter]

720
00:42:48,932 --> 00:42:51,601
Wasn't quite what I meant
by networking, but...

721
00:42:51,668 --> 00:42:53,070
You saw that?

722
00:42:53,136 --> 00:42:56,039
Sweetheart, I see it all.

723
00:42:56,106 --> 00:42:58,709
God, I'm so stupid!

724
00:42:58,775 --> 00:43:01,411
I could lose my job, my creditability...

725
00:43:01,478 --> 00:43:05,215
- And where the hell were you?
- Calm down, Samantha.

726
00:43:05,282 --> 00:43:09,820
I know Jaden. He won't
remember you or what happened.

727
00:43:09,886 --> 00:43:13,123
- Trust me.
- He remembers you.

728
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:16,326
I just wanted my friend
to have a good time.

729
00:43:17,861 --> 00:43:22,032
Admit it. You felt like
a sexy bitch, didn't you?

730
00:43:25,669 --> 00:43:29,306
Don't worry, your secret is safe with me.

731
00:43:40,784 --> 00:43:43,086
[telephone ringing]

732
00:43:43,153 --> 00:43:46,857
- [Tony] Yeah, here she is.
- Hello?

733
00:43:46,923 --> 00:43:49,426
[Giselle on phone] I haven't
heard from you, Samantha.

734
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:53,363
Uh, sorry. I've been swamped.

735
00:43:54,531 --> 00:43:56,466
How did you get this number?

736
00:43:56,533 --> 00:43:59,369
[Giselle] Listen, I was thinking
we could do something tonight.

737
00:43:59,436 --> 00:44:00,871
Just me and you.

738
00:44:00,937 --> 00:44:03,373
Oh, um, I-I can't.

739
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,242
I, I have a work party.

740
00:44:05,308 --> 00:44:07,244
Oh, great! I-I love parties.

741
00:44:07,310 --> 00:44:09,446
I'm taking Miles.

742
00:44:11,948 --> 00:44:13,183
Giselle?

743
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:15,752
[Giselle] No. That's great.

744
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:17,621
You guys been seeing each other?

745
00:44:17,687 --> 00:44:19,756
Yeah, a little.

746
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:23,493
That's great, Samantha.
Call me when you free up.

747
00:44:28,231 --> 00:44:29,199
[upbeat music]

748
00:44:29,266 --> 00:44:30,734
[indistinct chatter]

749
00:44:30,801 --> 00:44:33,737
[Sam] Hey, Kiki. Miles, this is Kiki.

750
00:44:33,804 --> 00:44:35,338
Kiki, this is Miles.

751
00:44:35,405 --> 00:44:37,974
- Miles.
- Pleasure to meet you, Kiki.

752
00:44:38,041 --> 00:44:41,211
- You two known each other long?
- Yeah, you could say that.

753
00:44:41,278 --> 00:44:42,846
I used to be the old shoulder to cry on

754
00:44:42,913 --> 00:44:47,117
until she moved on to
bigger and better things.

755
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:48,785
Isn't that right, Samantha?

756
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:51,521
No, Kiki. I-it's not like that.

757
00:44:52,989 --> 00:44:54,658
Nice to meet you, Miles.

758
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:57,894
What was that about?

759
00:44:57,961 --> 00:44:59,329
Oh, she's a great person,

760
00:44:59,396 --> 00:45:01,264
but a little bit clingy, you know?

761
00:45:01,331 --> 00:45:02,899
- Oh.
- I see my boss.

762
00:45:02,966 --> 00:45:04,768
- I wanna introduce you.
- Mm.

763
00:45:04,835 --> 00:45:05,902
Monty.

764
00:45:08,638 --> 00:45:10,707
I wanna introduce you
to my date, Miles Beck.

765
00:45:10,774 --> 00:45:13,076
- Miles. A pleasure.
- Pleasure's mine.

766
00:45:13,143 --> 00:45:15,612
You certainly have your
hands full with this one.

767
00:45:15,679 --> 00:45:16,880
[laughing]

768
00:45:16,947 --> 00:45:18,348
- So far so good. Mm.
- Mm.

769
00:45:18,415 --> 00:45:21,818
Oh, uh, and let me introduce
you to my new assistant.

770
00:45:21,885 --> 00:45:25,188
Please, uh, meet Giselle.

771
00:45:30,861 --> 00:45:33,830
Giselle, this is Sam, my top attorney.

772
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:36,333
- And, uh...
- Miles.

773
00:45:36,399 --> 00:45:38,301
Miles, yes.

774
00:45:38,368 --> 00:45:42,472
- Hello, Sam... Samantha?
- Mm.

775
00:45:42,539 --> 00:45:45,375
- Miles. Nice to meet you both.
- Yeah.

776
00:45:45,442 --> 00:45:47,377
Giselle was, uh, kind enough

777
00:45:47,444 --> 00:45:50,580
to accompany me to the party.

778
00:45:50,647 --> 00:45:53,416
Uh, I'm, I-I'm sorry,
there are a few people

779
00:45:53,483 --> 00:45:55,218
I need to talk with before they leave.

780
00:45:55,285 --> 00:45:57,754
- So, nice to meet you.
- Mm-hmm.

781
00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:05,896
[door opens, shuts]

782
00:46:05,962 --> 00:46:07,931
What do you think you're doing?

783
00:46:07,998 --> 00:46:09,432
[door opens]

784
00:46:13,470 --> 00:46:15,972
Well? What do you have to say for yourself?

785
00:46:16,039 --> 00:46:20,610
Oh, relax. I needed a job.
And I kinda like Monty.

786
00:46:20,677 --> 00:46:22,913
This is not a game. This is my life.

787
00:46:22,979 --> 00:46:26,416
So you can have the good job
and a nice car, but I can't?

788
00:46:26,483 --> 00:46:30,153
What are you talking about? Look at you!

789
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:32,656
You can have whatever you want,

790
00:46:32,722 --> 00:46:35,392
work where you want, but not here!

791
00:46:35,458 --> 00:46:37,661
I did it so we can be close.

792
00:46:37,727 --> 00:46:41,965
Remember, I know secrets about
you that no one else does?

793
00:46:42,032 --> 00:46:43,567
- Dark ones.
- Don't do that.

794
00:46:43,633 --> 00:46:45,702
And it looks like Miles
is treating you nice.

795
00:46:45,769 --> 00:46:48,538
- Look at you, glowing...
- Please don't.

796
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:53,209
What is this? After all that I've done?

797
00:46:53,276 --> 00:46:54,911
Look at you?

798
00:46:54,978 --> 00:46:57,714
Your clothes and Jaden.

799
00:46:57,781 --> 00:46:59,883
- Miles...
- Monty is my boss.

800
00:46:59,950 --> 00:47:04,454
- This is my work.
- And now it's my work, too.

801
00:47:04,521 --> 00:47:07,357
This way we can have a
lot more fun together.

802
00:47:08,625 --> 00:47:11,828
Well, maybe I'm tired of your reckless fun.

803
00:47:14,798 --> 00:47:18,602
I think we should take a
break from this friendship.

804
00:47:20,136 --> 00:47:21,538
Okay.

805
00:47:22,272 --> 00:47:23,506
Fine.

806
00:47:34,417 --> 00:47:37,554
[dramatic music]

807
00:47:51,635 --> 00:47:54,537
- [laptop keys clacking]
- Hey, Kiki, how are you?

808
00:47:55,805 --> 00:47:57,073
Okay.

809
00:48:04,848 --> 00:48:08,385
Look, I know I haven't been
available to you lately,

810
00:48:08,451 --> 00:48:11,755
and I'm sorry about that.

811
00:48:13,123 --> 00:48:16,092
Okay. I know you've been busy.

812
00:48:19,095 --> 00:48:21,097
But I do miss you, Sam.

813
00:48:22,365 --> 00:48:26,469
Maybe next week let's do something fun.

814
00:48:27,537 --> 00:48:29,939
Sounds good.

815
00:48:30,006 --> 00:48:32,876
I'm just working on the
details of your presentation.

816
00:48:33,610 --> 00:48:35,679
Anything else?

817
00:48:35,745 --> 00:48:36,846
No.

818
00:48:37,981 --> 00:48:39,616
Thank you.

819
00:48:44,454 --> 00:48:47,590
- [dramatic music]
- [laptop keys clacking]

820
00:48:53,697 --> 00:48:55,932
This bitch is a damn ghost.

821
00:49:00,437 --> 00:49:03,940
[Sam] Hey, Tony, come in here.
I want you to meet someone.

822
00:49:04,007 --> 00:49:06,342
Hey, Tony. Heard a lot about you, man.

823
00:49:06,409 --> 00:49:08,278
Hi, nice to meet you. See you later.

824
00:49:08,344 --> 00:49:10,346
- Okay, be home by 11:00.
- [Tony] I will!

825
00:49:10,413 --> 00:49:12,082
- I mean it, Tony.
- [Tony] I promise!

826
00:49:12,148 --> 00:49:14,150
- 11:00!
- [Tony] Okay!

827
00:49:14,217 --> 00:49:16,886
[chuckling]

828
00:49:16,953 --> 00:49:21,391
So, how's it been going
working with Giselle?

829
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:24,794
- Awkward as hell.
- Hm.

830
00:49:24,861 --> 00:49:27,864
Yo, I left the sauce in the car.

831
00:49:27,931 --> 00:49:29,532
No worries, I'll get it. Give me the keys.

832
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:30,934
- All right, you ready?
- Mm-hmm.

833
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,001
Okay.

834
00:49:33,403 --> 00:49:35,839
- Mm, boom.
- Hey.

835
00:49:35,905 --> 00:49:38,842
[dramatic music]

836
00:49:40,243 --> 00:49:42,779
[rustling]

837
00:49:52,989 --> 00:49:57,894
- [Sam] All right, here you go.
- Thank you very much.

838
00:49:57,961 --> 00:50:00,130
You want me to do the garlic bread?

839
00:50:00,196 --> 00:50:01,765
Oh, no, no, it's already in the oven.

840
00:50:01,831 --> 00:50:03,433
- Salad ready?
- Yup.

841
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:05,435
- No worries.
- [Sam chuckles]

842
00:50:08,505 --> 00:50:09,639
What the...

843
00:50:09,706 --> 00:50:11,341
- Hey, you okay?
- Yeah. I'm fine.

844
00:50:11,408 --> 00:50:13,109
Uh, just-just a little jittery.

845
00:50:13,176 --> 00:50:15,078
All right, all right. Well,
where's your breaker box?

846
00:50:15,145 --> 00:50:17,113
Um, in the basement down the hall.

847
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:18,848
Okay. All right.

848
00:50:18,915 --> 00:50:20,183
- Just stay right here, okay?
- Okay.

849
00:50:20,250 --> 00:50:21,551
[Miles] All right.

850
00:50:27,390 --> 00:50:30,527
[dramatic music]

851
00:50:39,536 --> 00:50:42,672
[intense music]

852
00:50:57,687 --> 00:51:00,156
[mumbling]

853
00:51:08,765 --> 00:51:11,901
[music continues]

854
00:51:25,815 --> 00:51:28,852
All right, well, uh, just try one.

855
00:51:34,557 --> 00:51:36,392
Oh.

856
00:51:36,459 --> 00:51:37,694
There we go.

857
00:51:43,566 --> 00:51:45,001
- Oh, Miles?
- Well, something...

858
00:51:45,068 --> 00:51:46,903
Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow
down, slow down, it's okay.

859
00:51:46,970 --> 00:51:48,805
I just saw someone outside in a mask.

860
00:51:48,872 --> 00:51:51,107
- What mask? Saw who?
- Uh, the Venetian mask.

861
00:51:51,174 --> 00:51:52,108
I-I've seen it before.

862
00:51:52,175 --> 00:51:53,743
I don't know what kinda game this is,

863
00:51:53,810 --> 00:51:55,645
but I'm calling the cops.

864
00:51:57,647 --> 00:52:00,149
Okay, um, well, we'll be on patrol

865
00:52:00,216 --> 00:52:02,285
for the rest of the night, counselor.

866
00:52:02,352 --> 00:52:07,056
But like I said, it's a fairly
common prank by teenagers.

867
00:52:07,123 --> 00:52:11,961
Unless, uh, you have a
reason to suspect anyone else.

868
00:52:12,028 --> 00:52:14,764
I'm tired of waiting! Just shut up!

869
00:52:17,767 --> 00:52:21,571
Um, a few weeks ago

870
00:52:21,638 --> 00:52:23,339
I had an incident.

871
00:52:23,406 --> 00:52:25,275
What kind of incident?

872
00:52:26,442 --> 00:52:28,778
I...

873
00:52:28,845 --> 00:52:32,248
went to that new bar downtown,

874
00:52:32,315 --> 00:52:33,883
the Hi-Ball.

875
00:52:35,919 --> 00:52:38,988
I met a man and, um...

876
00:52:40,456 --> 00:52:42,959
he was forcing himself on me.

877
00:52:44,427 --> 00:52:48,064
And before he could go any
further, a-another woman came

878
00:52:48,131 --> 00:52:51,234
and hit him over the head
with a pipe or something.

879
00:52:51,301 --> 00:52:52,969
One of your friends?

880
00:52:53,770 --> 00:52:55,838
No, um...

881
00:52:58,574 --> 00:53:00,510
A-a stranger.

882
00:53:00,576 --> 00:53:02,845
Uh, uh, did you call it in?

883
00:53:05,148 --> 00:53:08,718
Counselor, you of all people
should've called that in.

884
00:53:08,785 --> 00:53:12,622
I know. I've just been going through a lot.

885
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:15,725
It's not something I wanted to expose.

886
00:53:15,792 --> 00:53:19,162
[sighs] Yeah. Well, can you describe him?

887
00:53:19,228 --> 00:53:23,232
Muscular, 6'2-ish.

888
00:53:24,233 --> 00:53:26,002
Uh, white.

889
00:53:26,069 --> 00:53:29,539
He seemed to know quite a few people there.

890
00:53:29,605 --> 00:53:31,274
You got a name?

891
00:53:32,041 --> 00:53:33,209
Clay.

892
00:53:34,944 --> 00:53:37,180
I don't know his last name.

893
00:53:38,514 --> 00:53:40,283
Hold on a second.

894
00:53:43,219 --> 00:53:45,188
You know better than I
do that I'm not supposed

895
00:53:45,254 --> 00:53:46,622
to be showing you this.

896
00:53:46,689 --> 00:53:50,226
But, uh, is that the guy?

897
00:53:50,293 --> 00:53:51,828
[whimpers] Mm-hmm.

898
00:53:54,163 --> 00:53:55,865
Yes, that's him.

899
00:53:58,801 --> 00:54:01,170
Oh, my God, what did he do?

900
00:54:03,206 --> 00:54:04,974
He was murdered.

901
00:54:05,041 --> 00:54:07,443
Beaten to death a couple of days ago.

902
00:54:07,510 --> 00:54:10,780
So pretty sure it wasn't him.

903
00:54:10,847 --> 00:54:13,649
- Did you catch who did it?
- There's a suspect.

904
00:54:13,716 --> 00:54:16,686
Uh, he owed a lot of people money.

905
00:54:16,753 --> 00:54:19,155
I mean, that's really all I can say.

906
00:54:20,456 --> 00:54:23,993
Unless you know something
we don't, counselor.

907
00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:27,964
No. Only what I told you.

908
00:54:30,633 --> 00:54:33,469
Okay, um, well, listen, I'm really sorry

909
00:54:33,536 --> 00:54:35,838
about what happened to you, Ms. Connelly.

910
00:54:35,905 --> 00:54:38,775
But as to tonight, it's like I said before,

911
00:54:38,841 --> 00:54:41,644
it's usually a prank around here.

912
00:54:41,711 --> 00:54:44,414
So try to enjoy the rest of your night.

913
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:46,883
- Hm.
- Let's go.

914
00:54:46,949 --> 00:54:49,485
[instrumental music]

915
00:54:50,887 --> 00:54:52,989
Hey. Everything's gonna be okay.

916
00:54:53,056 --> 00:54:55,024
All right? I promise.

917
00:54:55,091 --> 00:54:57,427
I'mma be here for you, no matter what.

918
00:54:58,995 --> 00:55:01,064
You mean that, Miles?

919
00:55:01,130 --> 00:55:04,600
[chuckles] I haven't
heard that in a long time.

920
00:55:04,667 --> 00:55:06,135
I promise.

921
00:55:16,212 --> 00:55:19,248
[Miles] Hey, look at you.
Breakfast of champions, huh?

922
00:55:19,315 --> 00:55:21,884
- Good morning!
- [Tony and Miles] Good morning!

923
00:55:21,951 --> 00:55:23,386
What are you doing here?

924
00:55:23,453 --> 00:55:25,088
Hey, Tony, you want a ride to school?

925
00:55:25,154 --> 00:55:27,223
- Sure, yeah, yeah.
- Come on.

926
00:55:27,290 --> 00:55:30,026
- Bye, mom.
- See you later.

927
00:55:33,129 --> 00:55:36,432
Are you the princess, Samantha?

928
00:55:36,499 --> 00:55:38,301
Or are you the maid?

929
00:55:49,745 --> 00:55:52,882
[instrumental music]

930
00:55:57,286 --> 00:55:59,388
Terrence, good to see you again.

931
00:55:59,455 --> 00:56:02,792
- Jaden, always a pleasure.
- Oh, my God. Yes, sir.

932
00:56:02,859 --> 00:56:05,862
Uh, I wanna introduce Samantha Connelly.

933
00:56:05,928 --> 00:56:09,432
- Mr. Turk, a pleasure.
- Pleasures all mine.

934
00:56:10,399 --> 00:56:12,135
Have we met before?

935
00:56:13,703 --> 00:56:15,872
I-I don't think so.

936
00:56:18,074 --> 00:56:20,109
[laughing] Forgive me, man.

937
00:56:20,176 --> 00:56:21,878
I done took so many blows to the head,

938
00:56:21,944 --> 00:56:24,981
I can barely remember
most things, you know?

939
00:56:25,047 --> 00:56:27,517
- Uh, shall we? Yeah.
- Yeah, let's do it.

940
00:56:27,583 --> 00:56:30,953
Why don't you take a seat next
to Jim, and we'll get started.

941
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:33,556
- Hey.
- How's it goin', brother?

942
00:56:33,623 --> 00:56:35,992
My guy.

943
00:56:36,058 --> 00:56:38,761
- Good to see you, boss.
- What's up, bro?

944
00:56:38,828 --> 00:56:40,496
All right, let's do it.

945
00:56:43,766 --> 00:56:45,168
In this presentation,

946
00:56:45,234 --> 00:56:49,172
we present our proposed defense.

947
00:56:49,238 --> 00:56:52,875
Mr. Turk has a generally
positive reputation

948
00:56:52,942 --> 00:56:54,944
on and off the field.

949
00:56:55,011 --> 00:56:57,213
We plan to lean into his volunteer services

950
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:01,551
within the community to show
that he is a stand-up citizen.

951
00:57:01,617 --> 00:57:04,954
Through our trusted partnership
with private detectives,

952
00:57:05,021 --> 00:57:06,656
we can show that Mr. Turk's ex-wife

953
00:57:06,722 --> 00:57:09,125
hasn't exactly been in
remorse over their marriage.

954
00:57:09,192 --> 00:57:11,861
I like that. That's good.

955
00:57:11,928 --> 00:57:14,163
[gasps] Yo! Hey, hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

956
00:57:14,230 --> 00:57:16,532
What the hell is this, man?

957
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:19,035
- Kiki!
- Yo! No, what is this shit?

958
00:57:19,101 --> 00:57:21,804
- Kiki, do something!
- I...

959
00:57:21,871 --> 00:57:23,739
It's locking me out!

960
00:57:23,806 --> 00:57:28,010
[Jaden] Yo, hey! Y'all trying
to blackmail me for my money?

961
00:57:28,077 --> 00:57:30,146
- Huh? Is that what this is?
- No.

962
00:57:32,748 --> 00:57:34,150
Please...

963
00:57:35,418 --> 00:57:39,956
give me anything to make me understand

964
00:57:40,022 --> 00:57:43,025
what did this firm do to you

965
00:57:43,092 --> 00:57:46,429
to prompt this vindictiveness.

966
00:57:48,130 --> 00:57:51,300
We are potentially...

967
00:57:51,367 --> 00:57:55,137
looking at a major lawsuit.

968
00:57:55,871 --> 00:57:57,306
Giselle.

969
00:57:59,041 --> 00:58:02,311
- Excuse me?
- She did this, Monty.

970
00:58:02,378 --> 00:58:04,247
[chuckles]

971
00:58:04,313 --> 00:58:08,384
She forced you to screw Jaden publicly,

972
00:58:08,451 --> 00:58:10,286
photographed it,

973
00:58:10,353 --> 00:58:14,023
then waited for the right
moment to project it.

974
00:58:14,090 --> 00:58:18,594
Did she also twirl her
fake mustache as well?

975
00:58:18,661 --> 00:58:21,097
I did not screw Jaden.

976
00:58:21,163 --> 00:58:23,065
Look, I know it sounds crazy.

977
00:58:23,132 --> 00:58:26,068
You want to tell me why
you were harassing her

978
00:58:26,135 --> 00:58:29,272
in the bathroom at my party?

979
00:58:29,338 --> 00:58:33,175
We have a witness who
saw you confronting her.

980
00:58:34,543 --> 00:58:37,380
I'd be very careful

981
00:58:37,446 --> 00:58:42,051
about throwing around wild accusations.

982
00:58:43,052 --> 00:58:45,421
Thankfully, Jaden's team is eager

983
00:58:45,488 --> 00:58:49,025
to make this all go away quietly.

984
00:58:51,627 --> 00:58:53,796
You're an intelligent,

985
00:58:53,863 --> 00:58:56,966
driven attorney, Sam.

986
00:58:57,033 --> 00:59:00,169
I think you know how this ends.

987
00:59:00,236 --> 00:59:04,206
If it were me, I'd retain
counsel immediately.

988
00:59:04,273 --> 00:59:07,443
- Monty, please, just...
- Please, see yourself out.

989
00:59:18,220 --> 00:59:20,089
All this aside...

990
00:59:21,457 --> 00:59:24,360
I beg of you to be careful with her.

991
00:59:25,995 --> 00:59:29,131
[instrumental music]

992
00:59:36,172 --> 00:59:39,642
[Giselle] Admit it. You felt
like a sexy bitch, didn't you?

993
00:59:39,709 --> 00:59:42,645
- [Sam] You saw that?
- Sweetheart, I see it all.

994
01:00:06,502 --> 01:00:08,237
- What's up?
- Is Giselle here?

995
01:00:08,304 --> 01:00:10,239
- Who?
- Giselle.

996
01:00:10,306 --> 01:00:13,109
There's no one with that name here. Sorry.

997
01:00:13,175 --> 01:00:15,277
Uh, Bunny?

998
01:00:15,344 --> 01:00:19,115
- You know her?
- Yeah. She's a friend.

999
01:00:19,181 --> 01:00:23,152
A friend, right. She's no longer here.

1000
01:00:23,219 --> 01:00:25,020
Where is she?

1001
01:00:25,087 --> 01:00:28,357
I don't know, man. I, I let
her stay at my place for a bit.

1002
01:00:28,424 --> 01:00:29,959
She still owes me money.

1003
01:00:30,025 --> 01:00:33,062
So if you do find her, could
you let her know, please?

1004
01:00:33,129 --> 01:00:36,665
- Sure.
- Thanks. Good luck.

1005
01:00:57,520 --> 01:01:00,222
[Giselle laughing] Oh, my God!

1006
01:01:00,289 --> 01:01:02,792
- [Giselle] Is that really them?
- [Tony] Yeah.

1007
01:01:10,766 --> 01:01:12,301
[Giselle laughing]

1008
01:01:12,368 --> 01:01:16,138
[Giselle] They were so cute. I love it.

1009
01:01:16,205 --> 01:01:17,873
Hey, mom, I'm showing Giselle old photos

1010
01:01:17,940 --> 01:01:18,974
of you and dad from college.

1011
01:01:19,041 --> 01:01:20,509
What are you doing in my house?

1012
01:01:20,576 --> 01:01:22,111
Samantha, I heard what happened,

1013
01:01:22,178 --> 01:01:23,412
and I was worried about you,

1014
01:01:23,479 --> 01:01:24,747
so I came over to check on you.

1015
01:01:24,814 --> 01:01:28,117
And Tony was kind enough
to keep me company.

1016
01:01:28,184 --> 01:01:31,353
You need to leave my house
now before I call the police.

1017
01:01:31,420 --> 01:01:35,291
- Wait, mom...
- Tony, go outside. Now!

1018
01:01:35,357 --> 01:01:37,259
- Mom!
- Now!

1019
01:01:42,164 --> 01:01:44,400
Monty is one thing,

1020
01:01:44,467 --> 01:01:47,403
but that is my son.

1021
01:01:47,470 --> 01:01:49,505
My son!

1022
01:01:49,572 --> 01:01:52,541
You will leave him alone.

1023
01:01:53,409 --> 01:01:55,845
Now get out of my house!

1024
01:01:56,946 --> 01:02:01,217
Samantha, have you gone mad?

1025
01:02:01,283 --> 01:02:03,085
Do you really think I
would cross that line?

1026
01:02:03,152 --> 01:02:04,820
I mean, Tony's
like a nephew...

1027
01:02:04,887 --> 01:02:07,690
He is not your nephew.

1028
01:02:12,061 --> 01:02:16,232
I like this new you. It's sexy.

1029
01:02:18,234 --> 01:02:19,869
But let's be honest, Samantha.

1030
01:02:19,935 --> 01:02:24,473
Your behavior these past few
weeks hasn't been exemplary.

1031
01:02:24,540 --> 01:02:26,075
Berating store clerks,

1032
01:02:26,141 --> 01:02:29,945
inappropriate conduct
with your A-list clients.

1033
01:02:31,380 --> 01:02:32,781
[clicks tongue]

1034
01:02:32,848 --> 01:02:36,852
Thank you for everything
you've done for me.

1035
01:02:36,919 --> 01:02:40,389
But now I think it's time to
focus on my family, my work...

1036
01:02:40,456 --> 01:02:42,725
And where does that leave me?

1037
01:02:45,828 --> 01:02:48,764
I thought we were supposed
to be there for one another.

1038
01:02:49,965 --> 01:02:52,801
- Protect each other.
- Oh, Giselle or Bunny...

1039
01:02:52,868 --> 01:02:54,737
Whatever your name is...

1040
01:02:56,305 --> 01:02:58,707
get the hell out of my house!

1041
01:03:15,157 --> 01:03:17,593
[sobbing]

1042
01:03:19,261 --> 01:03:21,697
I love this.

1043
01:03:21,764 --> 01:03:22,998
I'm worth it.

1044
01:03:27,570 --> 01:03:29,538
- Hey!
- [gasps]

1045
01:03:29,605 --> 01:03:32,508
Oh, my God! How did you get in here?

1046
01:03:32,575 --> 01:03:33,876
Sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.

1047
01:03:33,943 --> 01:03:35,644
I knocked a few times. The door was open.

1048
01:03:35,711 --> 01:03:37,313
So you just let yourself in?

1049
01:03:37,379 --> 01:03:39,248
Babe, what's goin' on here?

1050
01:03:39,315 --> 01:03:40,950
It's very convenient that you and Giselle

1051
01:03:41,016 --> 01:03:44,086
wandered into my life
practically at the same time.

1052
01:03:44,153 --> 01:03:47,056
- You two running a scam on me...
- What? Babe, I don't even know...

1053
01:03:47,122 --> 01:03:48,824
How do I know that?

1054
01:03:50,359 --> 01:03:52,561
I tell you, life was a lot more

1055
01:03:52,628 --> 01:03:53,896
simple and better before you two.

1056
01:03:53,963 --> 01:03:57,800
Hey, stop, stop. You're being hurtful.

1057
01:03:57,866 --> 01:04:00,202
Uh, I'm not teamed up with Giselle. Okay?

1058
01:04:00,269 --> 01:04:02,871
So just tell me, what happened?

1059
01:04:02,938 --> 01:04:04,673
I got fired today.

1060
01:04:04,740 --> 01:04:06,942
And throwing away your
clothes is gonna help you out...

1061
01:04:07,009 --> 01:04:09,612
[grunts] These clothes...

1062
01:04:09,678 --> 01:04:12,681
This isn't me. I'm not that person.

1063
01:04:12,748 --> 01:04:15,884
- I think you should go.
- Seriously?

1064
01:04:17,453 --> 01:04:19,955
Come on, Sam, everything
is gonna be all right.

1065
01:04:20,022 --> 01:04:22,291
- I promise.
- Please.

1066
01:04:22,358 --> 01:04:25,294
I can't. I can't right now.

1067
01:04:26,161 --> 01:04:27,997
I need you to leave!

1068
01:04:29,732 --> 01:04:30,799
All right.

1069
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:42,111
No, I want them sued for
everything they got! All right?

1070
01:04:42,177 --> 01:04:46,215
Uh, yes! I understand we gotta
keep a low profile for the line.

1071
01:04:46,281 --> 01:04:48,884
But I don't care, okay?

1072
01:04:48,951 --> 01:04:51,020
No! No!

1073
01:04:51,086 --> 01:04:52,921
No, you listen to me, Calvin.

1074
01:04:52,988 --> 01:04:55,057
You just make it happen, all right?

1075
01:04:55,124 --> 01:04:58,093
And, look, I want that
female lawyer disbarred.

1076
01:04:58,160 --> 01:05:00,562
I don't care if you got
to ruin her damn life.

1077
01:05:00,629 --> 01:05:02,798
You just make it happen, all right?

1078
01:05:05,834 --> 01:05:08,771

1079
01:05:16,345 --> 01:05:19,481

[cell phone vibrating]

1081
01:05:41,503 --> 01:05:43,172
[Sam on voicemail] Hello,
this is Samantha Connelly.

1082
01:05:43,238 --> 01:05:45,240
Please leave a message
and I'll call you back

1083
01:05:45,307 --> 01:05:47,042
as soon as I can.

1084
01:05:56,318 --> 01:05:57,553
Giselle, what are you doing here?

1085
01:05:57,619 --> 01:06:00,989
What can I say? I miss my friend.

1086
01:06:01,056 --> 01:06:02,725
- I gotta go.
- Wait, wait, wait. I-I...

1087
01:06:02,791 --> 01:06:05,127
I just wanna know if she's okay.

1088
01:06:05,194 --> 01:06:06,462
- Okay?
- Yes.

1089
01:06:06,528 --> 01:06:07,863
You know, all that stuff
that you did to Sam,

1090
01:06:07,930 --> 01:06:09,565
she'd never do to you in a million years.

1091
01:06:09,631 --> 01:06:11,700
- You know that, right?
- I'm not doing anything to her.

1092
01:06:11,767 --> 01:06:13,368
I-I don't wanna hurt her.

1093
01:06:13,435 --> 01:06:15,604
I have nothing more to say to you.

1094
01:06:19,608 --> 01:06:22,745
[crickets chirping]

1095
01:06:24,113 --> 01:06:27,049

1097
01:06:53,575 --> 01:06:56,445
[Miles on voicemail] Hey,
this is Miles. Leave a message.

1098
01:07:09,358 --> 01:07:11,527
Come on, Miles, answer.

1099
01:07:20,102 --> 01:07:21,570
Miles?

1100
01:07:25,474 --> 01:07:27,176
Miles.

1101
01:07:31,547 --> 01:07:33,515
Miles, you awake?

1102
01:07:34,750 --> 01:07:37,419
I'm so sorry about earlier today.

1103
01:07:37,486 --> 01:07:40,055
My head was not on the level, it...

1104
01:07:41,657 --> 01:07:44,426
[intense music]

1105
01:07:44,493 --> 01:07:46,862
[gasps] Miles?

1106
01:07:48,030 --> 01:07:49,498
Miles?

1107
01:07:50,165 --> 01:07:51,533
[screaming]

1108
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:53,502
- [siren wailing]
- [indistinct radio chatter]

1109
01:07:54,870 --> 01:07:57,940
So you unlocked the door
and just walked right in?

1110
01:07:58,006 --> 01:08:01,176
Yes. How many times do
I have to go over it?

1111
01:08:01,243 --> 01:08:04,046
Come on, counselor, you know the routine.

1112
01:08:04,112 --> 01:08:06,748
You seriously think I had
something to do with this?

1113
01:08:06,815 --> 01:08:10,786
- I'm just asking questions.
- Questions?

1114
01:08:10,853 --> 01:08:13,055
You broke into his house at 3:15 a.m.

1115
01:08:13,121 --> 01:08:16,158
There are signs of
forced entry at the rear.

1116
01:08:16,225 --> 01:08:18,160
Yeah, questions.

1117
01:08:18,227 --> 01:08:22,197
If you're gonna arrest
me, officer, do it now.

1118
01:08:22,264 --> 01:08:26,502
If not, do trust that I
know what my rights are.

1119
01:08:26,568 --> 01:08:29,204
No doubt, counselor.

1120
01:08:29,271 --> 01:08:31,507
Also, the suspect,

1121
01:08:31,573 --> 01:08:34,610
Clay Davis' murder, cleared.

1122
01:08:34,676 --> 01:08:37,212
So we're still lookin' for his killer.

1123
01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:39,915
I wouldn't venture too far, Ms. Connelly.

1124
01:08:45,454 --> 01:08:48,590
[sobbing]

1125
01:09:01,904 --> 01:09:04,606
[cell phone ringing]

1126
01:09:04,673 --> 01:09:06,174
- [Tony] Hello?
- [Sam] Hey.

1127
01:09:06,241 --> 01:09:09,578
[Sam] I'm going away for
a few days, so listen.

1128
01:09:09,645 --> 01:09:13,916
I know I haven't been a good
mother these past few weeks.

1129
01:09:13,982 --> 01:09:17,052
Hell, these past few years.

1130
01:09:17,119 --> 01:09:19,922
- [Sam] I-I just wanted to tell...
- [Tony] I love you, mom.

1131
01:09:20,989 --> 01:09:23,125
[Sam] I love you, too, Tony.

1132
01:09:31,833 --> 01:09:34,970
[instrumental music]

1133
01:09:50,852 --> 01:09:53,689
Well, I'm glad I came out here, then.

1134
01:09:53,755 --> 01:09:55,791
I came out here for you.

1135
01:10:11,239 --> 01:10:13,041
Hey, Sam.

1136
01:10:13,108 --> 01:10:15,510
- [sighs] Kiki.
- Hey, Sammy.

1137
01:10:15,577 --> 01:10:17,679
- What are you doing here?
- Well...

1138
01:10:17,746 --> 01:10:20,048
I stopped by your house,
and you weren't there.

1139
01:10:20,115 --> 01:10:24,019
- So figured you'd be up here.
- You figured right.

1140
01:10:24,086 --> 01:10:28,623
You're the one person who
knows more about me than anyone.

1141
01:10:28,690 --> 01:10:30,892
Sam, I know you didn't hurt anybody.

1142
01:10:30,959 --> 01:10:33,428
And I came here to tell you that.

1143
01:10:33,495 --> 01:10:35,998
Thank you, Kiki.

1144
01:10:36,064 --> 01:10:39,234
Not everyone shares your opinion.

1145
01:10:39,301 --> 01:10:43,372
[sighs] I went from being a
PTA mom to a person of interest.

1146
01:10:43,438 --> 01:10:46,008
But I don't even care.

1147
01:10:48,110 --> 01:10:50,312
I just wish Miles were here.

1148
01:10:50,379 --> 01:10:52,614
Do they have any leads?

1149
01:10:52,681 --> 01:10:54,449
No.

1150
01:10:54,516 --> 01:10:57,285
[sighs] Okay, I have to tell you something.

1151
01:10:57,352 --> 01:11:00,655
And I don't know if it means
anything or if it'll help.

1152
01:11:00,722 --> 01:11:02,024
- But...
- What?

1153
01:11:02,090 --> 01:11:03,825
All right, I'm just gonna say.

1154
01:11:03,892 --> 01:11:07,396
The night your boyfriend died, I saw him.

1155
01:11:07,462 --> 01:11:09,931
He was coming out of
that bar around the corner

1156
01:11:09,998 --> 01:11:11,800
from the office, The Old Sparrow.

1157
01:11:11,867 --> 01:11:14,870
That's not a surprise. I, I kicked him out.

1158
01:11:14,936 --> 01:11:17,272
Well, Monty's assistant was there.

1159
01:11:17,339 --> 01:11:21,376
- I saw her approach his car.
- Giselle?

1160
01:11:21,443 --> 01:11:23,945
W-what happened? Did-did
they leave together?

1161
01:11:24,012 --> 01:11:25,447
No, they seemed to argue a bit.

1162
01:11:25,514 --> 01:11:29,785
But as far as I could
tell, Miles drove off alone.

1163
01:11:29,851 --> 01:11:34,723
Kiki, it's not a coincidence
that all of this is happening.

1164
01:11:34,790 --> 01:11:36,792
We need to go to the police now!

1165
01:11:36,858 --> 01:11:39,327
Let me go. I'll tell them what I saw.

1166
01:11:39,394 --> 01:11:41,963
I mean, if we go together,
they'll just think

1167
01:11:42,030 --> 01:11:43,532
you put me up to it or something.

1168
01:11:43,598 --> 01:11:46,802
- Hm.
- Let me handle it.

1169
01:11:46,868 --> 01:11:49,371
- Like I always do.
- Okay.

1170
01:11:49,438 --> 01:11:51,273
Thank you, Kiki. Really.

1171
01:11:51,339 --> 01:11:55,644
That's okay, Sam. I'm glad you're back.

1172
01:11:55,711 --> 01:11:56,845
You're gonna be okay up here alone?

1173
01:11:56,912 --> 01:11:58,380
Ah, no one knows I'm here.

1174
01:11:58,447 --> 01:12:00,482
Just Tony and the police.

1175
01:12:00,549 --> 01:12:02,751
And Tony's with his father.

1176
01:12:05,654 --> 01:12:08,423
I'm really sorry for how I acted.

1177
01:12:09,424 --> 01:12:11,193
Selfishly.

1178
01:12:12,527 --> 01:12:15,630
I promise, I won't ever
be that person again.

1179
01:12:15,697 --> 01:12:18,333
That's okay, Sam. I forgive you.

Hello?

[intense music]

1189
01:14:40,208 --> 01:14:42,077
Giselle! What are you doing here?

1190
01:14:42,143 --> 01:14:43,878
- You need to leave now!
- Listen to me.

1191
01:14:43,945 --> 01:14:45,881
I've been looking all over for you.

1192
01:14:45,947 --> 01:14:47,816
- You're in danger.
- You need to leave!

1193
01:14:47,882 --> 01:14:50,352
I know that you talked to
Miles the night he was murdered.

1194
01:14:50,418 --> 01:14:52,587
Yes, I talked to Miles, but you were upset

1195
01:14:52,654 --> 01:14:54,122
and I wanted to make sure you were okay.

1196
01:14:54,189 --> 01:14:55,857
Lies, they're all lies

1197
01:14:55,924 --> 01:14:56,958
coming out of your mouth.

1198
01:14:57,025 --> 01:14:58,526
- No!
- Did you murder him?

1199
01:14:58,593 --> 01:15:01,129
- I had nothing to do with that.
- Right.

1200
01:15:01,196 --> 01:15:03,999
- Just like the photos?
- What photos, Samant...

1201
01:15:04,065 --> 01:15:06,034
How stupid do you think I am?

1202
01:15:06,101 --> 01:15:08,270
My presentation. You ruined my career!

1203
01:15:08,336 --> 01:15:11,172
No, I did not! Listen to me.

1204
01:15:11,239 --> 01:15:12,974
I have something to show you, okay?

1205
01:15:13,041 --> 01:15:14,843
It will all make sense, I promise.

1206
01:15:14,909 --> 01:15:16,478
Just follow me.

1207
01:15:18,647 --> 01:15:21,483
[intense music]

1208
01:15:21,549 --> 01:15:23,418
[Sam] Where's Kiki?

[muffled screaming]

1210
01:15:27,188 --> 01:15:29,024
Kiki! What have you done?

1211
01:15:29,090 --> 01:15:30,926
Listen to me, Sam.

1212
01:15:30,992 --> 01:15:32,627
I may do things in my own weird way,

1213
01:15:32,694 --> 01:15:35,664
but I am not a killer. Why
would I wanna see you fail?

1214
01:15:35,730 --> 01:15:38,934
I-I built you up! I made you, sweetheart.

1215
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:42,404
Listen to how crazy you sound.
Do you even hear yourself?

1216
01:15:42,470 --> 01:15:45,040
Hang on, Kiki. Untie her now!

1217
01:15:45,106 --> 01:15:47,175
What would I have to gain

1218
01:15:47,242 --> 01:15:50,445
to see you lose your career? Miles! Huh?

1219
01:15:50,512 --> 01:15:52,547
Once I stopped listening to
you, you couldn't take it.

1220
01:15:52,614 --> 01:15:54,616
You're a control freak, you're obsessed.

1221
01:15:54,683 --> 01:15:56,918
And you tried to frame
me for Miles' murder.

1222
01:15:56,985 --> 01:15:59,220
The setup for Miles'
murder wasn't meant for you.

1223
01:15:59,287 --> 01:16:01,823
It was meant for me, you
going over to his place

1224
01:16:01,890 --> 01:16:05,193
wasn't accounted for, but
I was seen talking to him.

1225
01:16:05,260 --> 01:16:08,596
You crazy bitch. Untie her now!

1226
01:16:10,899 --> 01:16:12,367
[Kiki groaning]

1227
01:16:14,502 --> 01:16:17,272
- Ah!
- Kiki, are you okay?

1228
01:16:17,339 --> 01:16:19,307
She tried to kill me. She's insane!

1229
01:16:19,374 --> 01:16:21,176
And you're a stalker!

1230
01:16:21,242 --> 01:16:24,212
Tell her, tell her you saw
Miles the night he died.

1231
01:16:24,279 --> 01:16:26,081
I saw you hiding in your car!

1232
01:16:26,147 --> 01:16:27,749
The person you should be worried about

1233
01:16:27,816 --> 01:16:29,284
is standing right behind you.

1234
01:16:29,351 --> 01:16:32,053
- She's the obsessed one.
- Throw me the keys.

1235
01:16:32,120 --> 01:16:33,588
She wanted you back to the way you were

1236
01:16:33,655 --> 01:16:36,224
when you were helpless
and-and-and alone.

1237
01:16:36,291 --> 01:16:38,927
- She wants you all to herself.
- That is absurd.

1238
01:16:38,993 --> 01:16:41,229
- You are sick!
- I'm not.

1239
01:16:41,296 --> 01:16:44,232
Okay, how would I have access

1240
01:16:44,299 --> 01:16:46,701
to your presentation
when she prepared it, huh?

1241
01:16:46,768 --> 01:16:48,770
Don't listen to her, Sam,
let's go to the police.

1242
01:16:48,837 --> 01:16:52,340
Oh, bravo, Kiki. This is what
you wanted the whole time.

1243
01:16:52,407 --> 01:16:54,976
- How you set me up!
- Keys! Now!

1244
01:16:55,043 --> 01:16:59,581
Remember, remember the fairytale
that I told you in there?

1245
01:16:59,647 --> 01:17:03,585
She's the maid. I'm the talking
horse. I-I'm your friend.

1246
01:17:03,651 --> 01:17:04,886
Enough!

1247
01:17:04,953 --> 01:17:07,822
It's beautiful that you
have a family and-and a home,

1248
01:17:07,889 --> 01:17:10,024
and maybe I wanted to
share a little bit of that

1249
01:17:10,091 --> 01:17:12,093
because I don't have one of my own.

1250
01:17:12,160 --> 01:17:14,629
But I would never hurt
you, Sam. I created you.

1251
01:17:14,696 --> 01:17:16,431
Do you hear that? You
know how crazy she is?

1252
01:17:16,498 --> 01:17:18,767
- You're crazy!
- No, Sam.

1253
01:17:18,833 --> 01:17:21,236
Do not believe her. You're
not believing her, are you?

1254
01:17:21,302 --> 01:17:23,671
And as soon as you started
to spread your wings,

1255
01:17:23,738 --> 01:17:25,006
she couldn't take it.

1256
01:17:25,073 --> 01:17:27,742
You think I didn't see you
hiding and-and stalking us

1257
01:17:27,809 --> 01:17:29,444
around town, following us?

1258
01:17:29,511 --> 01:17:30,979
Why would I? Why would I do that?

1259
01:17:31,046 --> 01:17:33,548
Because who else do you
have? Your little dogs?

1260
01:17:33,615 --> 01:17:35,216
You don't have any other friends!

1261
01:17:35,283 --> 01:17:36,651
Sam is the only friend I need!

1262
01:17:36,718 --> 01:17:39,120
And you don't wanna share her, do you?

1263
01:17:39,187 --> 01:17:40,722
And especially not with me.

1264
01:17:40,789 --> 01:17:43,258
Where were you when someone
was creepin' around Sam's house?

1265
01:17:43,324 --> 01:17:45,760
- Where were you?
- I was with Monty.

1266
01:17:45,827 --> 01:17:47,529
Call him, you can ask him for yourself.

1267
01:17:47,595 --> 01:17:49,397
T-that was just a prank by teenagers.

1268
01:17:49,464 --> 01:17:53,034
My God! You know, for a-a
lawyer, you're super naive.

1269
01:17:53,101 --> 01:17:56,037
Notice she didn't answer the question.

1270
01:17:56,104 --> 01:17:59,374
And what about Clay from the
bar, huh? You do him in as well?

1271
01:17:59,441 --> 01:18:01,709
I had nothing to do with that lowlife!

1272
01:18:01,776 --> 01:18:04,412
Oh, yeah, you did.

1273
01:18:04,479 --> 01:18:06,714
How do you know about him?

1274
01:18:08,316 --> 01:18:11,152
I, I-I overheard one of
your calls to the police.

1275
01:18:11,219 --> 01:18:12,954
I never called the police!

1276
01:18:13,021 --> 01:18:15,323
You killed him, didn't you, Kiki?

1277
01:18:15,390 --> 01:18:17,792
No, you killed him! I know you did.

1278
01:18:17,859 --> 01:18:19,394
And you followed us to Jaden's party, too.

1279
01:18:19,461 --> 01:18:21,162
She's setting me up, I would

1280
01:18:21,229 --> 01:18:22,197
never do anything to hurt you.

1281
01:18:22,263 --> 01:18:23,298
[Giselle] Damn, Kiki,

1282
01:18:23,364 --> 01:18:24,999
you're a cold-blooded murderer.

1283
01:18:25,066 --> 01:18:26,601
You're not getting away with this.

1284
01:18:26,668 --> 01:18:29,537
- We have been friends forever!
- Oh, give it a rest!

1285
01:18:29,604 --> 01:18:31,973
- [grunts]
- Kiki! Stop it!

1286
01:18:32,040 --> 01:18:34,476
[grunting]

1287
01:18:35,844 --> 01:18:39,848
- Sammy, do you believe me?
- Stop it, everybody.

1288
01:18:39,914 --> 01:18:41,850
[grunting]

1289
01:18:42,717 --> 01:18:43,785
Leave me!

1290
01:18:45,019 --> 01:18:46,988
- No!
- [gunshot]

1291
01:18:47,055 --> 01:18:50,191
[groaning]

1292
01:18:54,395 --> 01:18:56,297
Oh, my God!

1293
01:19:11,346 --> 01:19:13,414
Sammy! Believe me, Sammy.

1294
01:19:13,481 --> 01:19:15,316
[indistinct chatter]

1295
01:19:15,383 --> 01:19:17,552
Believe me! Come on, we gotta go.

1296
01:19:17,619 --> 01:19:20,255
We've gotta go! Come, come on.

1297
01:19:22,190 --> 01:19:23,758
Come on, Sammy.

1298
01:19:24,559 --> 01:19:27,695
[breathing heavily]

1299
01:19:32,267 --> 01:19:34,736
You know, that was her game.

1300
01:19:34,802 --> 01:19:36,538
She manipulates.

1301
01:19:37,205 --> 01:19:39,207
She's a killer.

1302

[woman on radio] In breaking
news, All-Star wide-receiver

1303

Jaden Turk was found
dead early this morning.

1304
01:19:46,414 --> 01:19:48,383
Police have launched a full investigation

1305
01:19:48,449 --> 01:19:50,318
and we will bring you those details

1306
01:19:50,385 --> 01:19:53,221
as soon as they are released.
