<i>Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up!

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Where were you?

3
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,600
Oh, Jean. I am so sorry.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,748
I'll never hurt you, or anyone ever again.

5
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,000
It's too late.

6
00:00:26,748 --> 00:00:29,363
- No! Jean!
- You can't hide...

7
00:00:29,364 --> 00:00:32,001
No, Jean, no!

8
00:00:41,465 --> 00:00:44,553
I've been trying to find the
Wolverine for over a year.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,600
It's not who I am anymore.

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,870
My employer wants to say thank you
for saving his life all those years ago.

11
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,014
Run! Now!

12
00:01:13,718 --> 00:01:16,555
There was a time when
our enemies knew honor.

13
00:01:18,951 --> 00:01:22,000
I wanted to offer you
something no one else can.

14
00:01:22,846 --> 00:01:23,794
A gift.

15
00:01:23,962 --> 00:01:27,001
You have struggled long enough.

16
00:01:27,329 --> 00:01:29,150
I can end your eternity.

17
00:01:30,281 --> 00:01:32,000
Make you mortal.

JULY 26

19
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,534
What they did to me

20
00:01:42,792 --> 00:01:43,697
what I am,

21
00:01:45,897 --> 00:01:47,033
can't be undone.

22
00:01:48,293 --> 00:01:49,859
Don't be so sure.

23
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:57,000
I'm not healing like before.

24
00:01:58,962 --> 00:02:00,709
His flesh is weak now.

25
00:02:06,234 --> 00:02:07,229
Eternity...

26
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:09,432
can be a curse.

27
00:02:11,595 --> 00:02:14,000
A man can run out of things to live for.

28
00:02:22,836 --> 00:02:24,000
That day ain't here yet.
