1
00:01:29,673 --> 00:01:31,550
See you tomorrow.

2
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:51,904
Oh, my God!

3
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:16,094
I'm in.

4
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:10,959
We're almost there.

5
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:15,047
- Sir, are you sure about this?
- I told you, we're going to be all right.

6
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:20,677
I understand, sir. It's just that I'm scoping
some serious sentinel activity up here.

7
00:04:58,841 --> 00:05:01,260
- Link.
- Yes, sir?

8
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:04,596
Given your situation, I can't say
I understand your reasons...

9
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:07,391
...for volunteering to operate
onboard my ship.

10
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:11,562
However, if you wish to continue to
do so, I must ask you to do one thing.

11
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:13,522
What's that, sir?

12
00:05:14,356 --> 00:05:15,607
To trust me.

13
00:05:15,858 --> 00:05:17,693
Yes, sir. I will, sir.

14
00:05:19,778 --> 00:05:22,948
- I mean, I do, sir.
- I hope so.

15
00:05:23,115 --> 00:05:26,451
Repatch the main AC to the hard drives
and stand by to broadcast.

16
00:05:26,702 --> 00:05:27,703
Yes, sir.

17
00:05:36,587 --> 00:05:38,881
Still can't sleep?

18
00:05:40,883 --> 00:05:42,217
You wanna talk?

19
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:46,889
They're just dreams.

20
00:05:49,308 --> 00:05:51,602
If you're afraid of something...

21
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:53,562
I just wish...

22
00:05:54,313 --> 00:05:56,481
I wish I knew what I'm supposed to do.

23
00:05:56,732 --> 00:05:58,567
That's all.

24
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:01,069
I just wish I knew.

25
00:06:01,195 --> 00:06:05,490
She's gonna call. Don't worry.

26
00:06:05,657 --> 00:06:06,742
Here you are.

27
00:06:06,825 --> 00:06:10,245
- Are we ready to go?
- We're already late.

28
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:15,083
These geotherms confirm
the last transmission of the <i>Osiris</i>.

29
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:17,586
The machines are digging.

30
00:06:19,254 --> 00:06:21,507
They're boring from the surface
down to Zion.

31
00:06:21,632 --> 00:06:24,259
- Mother...
- They'll avoid the perimeter defense.

32
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:25,928
How fast are they moving?

33
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:29,431
Control estimates their descent
at 100 meters an hour.

34
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:32,059
- How deep are they?
- Almost 2000 meters.

35
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:35,812
- What about the scans from the <i>Osiris</i>?
- They can't be accurate.

36
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:37,898
- They may be.
- It's not possible.

37
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:40,526
That'd mean there are
a quarter-million sentinels.

38
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:42,194
- That's right.
- That can't be.

39
00:06:42,361 --> 00:06:44,029
Why not?

40
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:47,908
A sentinel for every man,
woman and child in Zion.

41
00:06:48,951 --> 00:06:52,788
That sounds exactly like
the thinking of a machine to me.

42
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:55,207
Morpheus, glad you could join us.

43
00:06:55,707 --> 00:06:56,875
Niobe.

44
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:01,547
My apologies to all.
But as you are undoubtedly aware...

45
00:07:01,797 --> 00:07:05,133
...it's become difficult to locate
a secure broadcast position.

46
00:07:05,217 --> 00:07:08,470
- Squiddies got our best spots.
- Lines are crawling with them.

47
00:07:08,637 --> 00:07:12,391
And if Niobe's right, in 72 hours
there's gonna be a quarter-million more.

48
00:07:12,641 --> 00:07:13,767
What are we gonna do?

49
00:07:13,976 --> 00:07:16,144
We're gonna do what
Commander Lock ordered.

50
00:07:16,562 --> 00:07:19,064
We'll evacuate broadcast level
and return to Zion.

51
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:24,403
And does the commander have a plan
for stopping 250,000 sentinels?

52
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:27,322
A strategy is still being formulated.

53
00:07:27,406 --> 00:07:29,074
I'm sure it is.

54
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:46,091
What do you think
we should do, Morpheus?

55
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,510
- We should proceed as ordered...
- What is it?

56
00:07:48,594 --> 00:07:49,636
I don't know.

57
00:07:49,845 --> 00:07:52,681
...however, I must ask one of you
for help.

58
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:58,520
Some of you believe as I believe, some
of you do not. Those of you that do...

59
00:07:58,687 --> 00:08:01,190
...know we are nearing
the end of our struggle.

60
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,611
The prophecy will be fulfilled soon.
But before it can be...

61
00:08:05,777 --> 00:08:09,114
...the Oracle must be consulted.

62
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,374
If we return and recharge now...

63
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:23,212
...we can be back in 36 hours, well
before the machines reach this depth.

64
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,297
Do you understand what you're asking?

65
00:08:25,506 --> 00:08:28,300
I am asking that one ship
remain here in our place...

66
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:31,136
...in case the Oracle
should attempt to contact us.

67
00:08:31,345 --> 00:08:34,473
Bullshit. You're asking one of us
to disobey a direct order.

68
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:39,144
That's right, I am. But we well know
that the reason most of us are here...

69
00:08:39,394 --> 00:08:41,980
...is because of our affinity
for disobedience.

70
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:44,066
What happens when you
get back to Zion...

71
00:08:44,274 --> 00:08:46,652
...and the commander
throws you in the stockade?

72
00:08:46,777 --> 00:08:48,028
He won't.

73
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:52,324
Goddamn it, Morpheus,
you ain't never gonna change.

74
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:55,827
Shit, I'll do it just to see
what Deadbolt does to you.

75
00:08:55,953 --> 00:08:57,496
You got 36 hours.

76
00:09:00,332 --> 00:09:02,084
I'm looking for Neo.

77
00:09:02,334 --> 00:09:05,671
- Never heard of him.
- I have something for him.

78
00:09:06,922 --> 00:09:09,091
A gift.

79
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:12,219
You see, he set me free.

80
00:09:14,513 --> 00:09:16,932
Fine, whatever. Now piss off.

81
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:20,435
- Who was that?
- How did you know someone was here?

82
00:09:20,686 --> 00:09:22,104
He gave you this.

83
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:29,194
He said you set him free.

84
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:33,615
Is everything all right, sir?

85
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:36,535
The meeting is over.
Retreat to your exits.

86
00:09:36,702 --> 00:09:38,912
- Agents are coming.
- Agents?

87
00:09:39,454 --> 00:09:40,789
Go.

88
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,633
Hiya, fellas.

89
00:09:51,842 --> 00:09:52,968
- It's him.
- The anomaly.

90
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:54,344
- Do we proceed?
- Yes.

91
00:09:54,553 --> 00:09:57,055
- He is still...
- Only human.

92
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:05,480
Upgrades.

93
00:11:00,452 --> 00:11:02,955
- That went as expected.
- Yes.

94
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:05,791
It's happening exactly as before.

95
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:08,585
Well, not exactly.

96
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:14,424
- What happened?
- I can't figure it out.

97
00:11:14,633 --> 00:11:16,301
Agents just came out of nowhere.

98
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:19,429
Then the code got all weird.
Encryption I've never seen.

99
00:11:19,638 --> 00:11:22,558
- Is Neo okay?
- Okay? Shit, you should've seen him.

100
00:11:22,766 --> 00:11:24,142
Where is he now?

101
00:11:25,561 --> 00:11:27,354
He's doing his Superman thing.

102
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,780
Where are you?

103
00:12:23,452 --> 00:12:26,997
This is the <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i>,
requesting access through Gate Three.

104
00:12:31,043 --> 00:12:35,547
<i>Nebuchadnezzar</i>, this is Zion Control.
Maintain present velocity and stand by.

105
00:12:35,756 --> 00:12:37,216
<i>Roger that, Control.</i>

106
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:40,886
This is Control requesting immediate
stand-down of arms at Gate Three.

107
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:44,806
We have the <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i>
on approach. Let's open her up.

108
00:12:50,479 --> 00:12:53,398
<i>You are cleared through</i>
<i>Gate Three to Bay Seven.</i>

109
00:12:53,565 --> 00:12:55,234
Roger that, Control.

110
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:05,494
Door's open, bed's made.
Welcome home.

111
00:13:06,203 --> 00:13:08,413
No place like it.

112
00:13:22,594 --> 00:13:26,348
Roger that, Control. Zion Control,
stand by for Gate Three lockdown.

113
00:14:15,856 --> 00:14:18,233
<i>The</i> Nebuchadnezzar <i>is down.</i>
<i>Bay Seven.</i>

114
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:19,484
Understood.

115
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:30,746
Captain Mifune.

116
00:14:31,914 --> 00:14:33,081
Captain Morpheus.

117
00:14:33,248 --> 00:14:36,084
Are you here to escort me
to the stockade, captain?

118
00:14:36,293 --> 00:14:39,630
- I'm just here to keep the peace.
- Commander Lock demands...

119
00:14:40,881 --> 00:14:44,092
Requests your immediate counsel, sir.

120
00:14:45,052 --> 00:14:46,845
- Link.
- Sir?

121
00:14:47,012 --> 00:14:49,515
I want the ship ready to go
as soon as possible.

122
00:14:49,765 --> 00:14:51,308
Understood, sir.

123
00:14:58,524 --> 00:15:00,901
- What is it between them?
- Morpheus and Lock?

124
00:15:02,027 --> 00:15:04,112
- Niobe.
- Captain Niobe?

125
00:15:04,363 --> 00:15:07,574
She used to be with Morpheus.
Now she's with Lock.

126
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:10,369
What happened?

127
00:15:10,619 --> 00:15:14,039
Morpheus went to the Oracle.
After that, everything changed.

128
00:15:14,248 --> 00:15:16,875
Yeah, she can do that.

129
00:15:17,042 --> 00:15:18,210
Neo!

130
00:15:19,253 --> 00:15:22,047
- Oh, no.
- How does he always know?

131
00:15:22,297 --> 00:15:24,132
Doesn't he have anything better to do?

132
00:15:24,383 --> 00:15:27,052
You know what they say
about the life you save.

133
00:15:27,302 --> 00:15:29,054
I didn't save his life.

134
00:15:31,223 --> 00:15:32,599
Hiya, Neo.

135
00:15:33,725 --> 00:15:36,353
- Trinity, Link.
- Hey.

136
00:15:36,562 --> 00:15:40,232
- It's great to have you back.
- Thanks. It's good to be back.

137
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,151
- Can I carry that for you?
- No, I can carry my own bag.

138
00:15:43,318 --> 00:15:44,987
- Trinity?
- I'm fine.

139
00:15:45,946 --> 00:15:48,740
- You can carry these.
- Yeah, sure, Link.

140
00:15:53,745 --> 00:15:58,250
Hey, you know, next year
I'm old enough to join a crew, right?

141
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:01,170
I've been thinking about it,
and I've made my decision.

142
00:16:01,378 --> 00:16:02,754
Let me guess.

143
00:16:03,255 --> 00:16:05,257
I want to join the <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i>.

144
00:16:06,258 --> 00:16:09,845
Morpheus hasn't filled the other
positions, except for you, Link.

145
00:16:09,928 --> 00:16:11,263
I'm sure he has reasons...

146
00:16:11,513 --> 00:16:14,850
...but the more I think about it,
the more I think it's meant to be.

147
00:16:15,017 --> 00:16:16,518
You know, it's fate.

148
00:16:16,685 --> 00:16:18,270
You're the reason I'm here, Neo.

149
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:20,981
I told you, you found me.
I didn't find you.

150
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:23,692
I know, but you got me out.
You saved me.

151
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,403
You saved yourself.

152
00:16:42,794 --> 00:16:46,006
- Morpheus.
- Commander Lock.

153
00:16:46,298 --> 00:16:50,802
I spoke to the other captains. I wanted to
offer you a chance to explain your actions.

154
00:16:51,011 --> 00:16:53,805
I wasn't aware that my actions
required any explanation.

155
00:16:54,056 --> 00:16:56,308
You were given an order
to return to Zion.

156
00:16:56,433 --> 00:16:59,228
- I did.
- You asked for one ship to remain behind.

157
00:16:59,478 --> 00:17:02,147
I would have stayed,
but I needed to recharge my ship.

158
00:17:02,272 --> 00:17:04,983
So you admit to a direct contravention
of your duty.

159
00:17:05,192 --> 00:17:08,654
We need a presence inside the Matrix
to await contact from the Oracle.

160
00:17:08,737 --> 00:17:10,739
I don't want to hear that shit!

161
00:17:10,906 --> 00:17:13,534
I don't care about oracles
or prophecies or messiahs!

162
00:17:13,742 --> 00:17:17,162
I care about one thing: Stopping that army
from destroying this city.

163
00:17:17,287 --> 00:17:20,082
To do that I need soldiers
to obey my orders.

164
00:17:20,332 --> 00:17:24,920
With all due respect, commander,
there is only one way to save our city.

165
00:17:25,087 --> 00:17:26,463
How?

166
00:17:26,672 --> 00:17:29,508
- Neo.
- Goddamn it, Morpheus.

167
00:17:29,591 --> 00:17:32,177
Not everyone believes what you believe.

168
00:17:32,427 --> 00:17:34,513
My beliefs do not require them to.

169
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:46,608
There's a gathering tonight. Everyone's
talking. A lot of people are scared.

170
00:17:46,775 --> 00:17:49,528
No one remembers the last time
so many ships were docked.

171
00:17:49,695 --> 00:17:52,614
- Something big is happening, isn't it?
- Hey.

172
00:17:52,865 --> 00:17:55,951
We're not allowed to say anything,
so stop asking.

173
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:04,418
Goddamn, it's good to be home.

174
00:18:17,472 --> 00:18:20,392
I'm recommending that you
be removed from duty.

175
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:22,895
That is, of course,
your prerogative, commander.

176
00:18:23,061 --> 00:18:26,940
If it were up to me, you wouldn't set foot
on a ship for the rest of your life.

177
00:18:27,149 --> 00:18:30,402
Then I am grateful that it is not up to you.

178
00:18:36,325 --> 00:18:38,744
- Councillor Hamann.
- Commander.

179
00:18:39,453 --> 00:18:42,080
- Captain.
- Councillor.

180
00:18:42,247 --> 00:18:45,584
Council's asked me to speak tonight
at the temple gathering.

181
00:18:45,834 --> 00:18:49,880
The presence of the fleet and the
persistence of rumors must be addressed.

182
00:18:50,088 --> 00:18:52,591
The people must be told
what is happening.

183
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,468
Of course, councillor.

184
00:18:55,177 --> 00:19:00,432
But might I advise a level of discretion
concerning specific details.

185
00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:03,519
- We do not wish to start a panic.
- Quite right.

186
00:19:03,769 --> 00:19:06,855
A panic is not what anyone wants.

187
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:10,317
What about you, captain?
What would you advise?

188
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:17,533
The truth. No one will panic,
because there is nothing to fear.

189
00:19:17,699 --> 00:19:19,785
That army won't reach
the gates of Zion.

190
00:19:20,619 --> 00:19:24,206
- What makes you so sure?
- Consider what we have seen, councillor.

191
00:19:24,373 --> 00:19:26,291
Consider that in the past six months...

192
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:28,460
...we have freed more minds
than in six years.

193
00:19:28,669 --> 00:19:31,588
This attack is an act of desperation.

194
00:19:31,797 --> 00:19:35,634
I believe very soon the prophecy
will be fulfilled and this war will end.

195
00:19:37,553 --> 00:19:39,638
I hope you're right, captain.

196
00:19:39,805 --> 00:19:42,558
I do not believe it to be
a matter of hope, councillor.

197
00:19:42,641 --> 00:19:45,227
It is simply a matter of time.

198
00:19:47,437 --> 00:19:48,897
My stop.

199
00:19:49,106 --> 00:19:50,482
See you soon.

200
00:19:50,649 --> 00:19:52,150
Hopefully not too soon.

201
00:19:52,234 --> 00:19:55,487
Let's go, kid.
These two got things to do.

202
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:06,623
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

203
00:20:06,832 --> 00:20:09,251
I am if you're thinking
this elevator is too slow.

204
00:20:09,334 --> 00:20:12,671
- How long do we charge the <i>Neb</i>?
- Twenty-four, maybe 30 hours.

205
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:17,050
Some people go their entire lives
without hearing news that good.

206
00:20:41,533 --> 00:20:45,829
Neo, please, I have a son,
Jacob, aboard the <i>Gnosis</i>.

207
00:20:46,038 --> 00:20:49,458
- Please, watch over him.
- I'll try.

208
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:51,793
I have a daughter on the <i>Icarus</i>.

209
00:20:52,628 --> 00:20:53,879
No, wait.

210
00:20:54,046 --> 00:20:56,548
It's all right. They need you.

211
00:20:56,673 --> 00:20:58,967
- I need you.
- I know.

212
00:20:59,468 --> 00:21:01,803
There's time.

213
00:21:06,808 --> 00:21:08,894
Where's my puss...?

214
00:21:09,061 --> 00:21:11,396
- Hey!
- Uncle Link!

215
00:21:11,563 --> 00:21:13,148
God!

216
00:21:13,357 --> 00:21:15,317
Uncle Link!

217
00:21:15,442 --> 00:21:19,071
Oh, my God! You're so huge!

218
00:21:19,196 --> 00:21:21,406
- You should be picking me up!
- No!

219
00:21:21,573 --> 00:21:23,075
- Yeah!
- Okay!

220
00:21:23,242 --> 00:21:24,910
Okay? All right.

221
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:28,163
Now, we're gonna have
to work together here, okay?

222
00:21:28,372 --> 00:21:30,582
One, two, three, lift!

223
00:21:30,749 --> 00:21:33,919
Oh, my God!
What are you feeding these two?

224
00:21:34,086 --> 00:21:36,839
Come on, kids. It's time to go.

225
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:39,925
- Hey, Cas.
- Hey.

226
00:21:40,467 --> 00:21:42,970
- Good to have you home, Link.
- Good to be home.

227
00:21:43,178 --> 00:21:44,930
You be careful with her.

228
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:47,975
Don't worry about me.
He's the one that's gonna get it.

229
00:21:49,852 --> 00:21:52,145
Out the door! Both of you, march!

230
00:21:52,354 --> 00:21:54,356
- Bye!
- Bye!

231
00:22:00,779 --> 00:22:02,281
I'm gonna get what?

232
00:22:03,615 --> 00:22:07,703
Every ship up there's been home two, even
three times more than the <i>Nebuchadnezzar.</i>

233
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:11,623
Come on, Zee.
I thought we were past this.

234
00:22:11,874 --> 00:22:15,294
- We'll be when you operate another ship.
- I can't do that.

235
00:22:15,502 --> 00:22:16,962
- Why?
- You know why.

236
00:22:17,171 --> 00:22:20,299
If Dozer knew how I felt,
he wouldn't have asked you to do this.

237
00:22:21,049 --> 00:22:23,552
Maybe. But it's too late now.

238
00:22:23,719 --> 00:22:26,346
I made a promise,
and some promises can't be unmade.

239
00:22:26,555 --> 00:22:29,141
- It's not fair.
- Nobody said it was gonna be.

240
00:22:29,391 --> 00:22:32,311
You think Cas thinks it's fair
that I'm here and Dozer's not?

241
00:22:38,233 --> 00:22:41,486
I lost two brothers to that ship, Link.

242
00:22:42,613 --> 00:22:44,823
I'm afraid of it.

243
00:22:46,366 --> 00:22:48,994
I'm afraid it's gonna take you too.

244
00:22:49,703 --> 00:22:51,496
It won't.

245
00:22:51,663 --> 00:22:53,457
How can you say that to me?

246
00:22:53,665 --> 00:22:55,667
Because of Morpheus.

247
00:22:55,751 --> 00:23:00,422
Because of what he's told me. He said
that this is it, that it will be over soon.

248
00:23:00,547 --> 00:23:04,843
- Link, Morpheus is crazy.
- No doubt.

249
00:23:05,344 --> 00:23:08,472
But Tank and Dozer believed him.
And I'll tell you what...

250
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:14,019
...after being on that ship and seeing Neo
do the things he can do, I gotta say...

251
00:23:14,186 --> 00:23:16,188
...I'm starting to believe him too.

252
00:23:21,401 --> 00:23:23,779
Be careful, Link.

253
00:23:29,117 --> 00:23:31,537
Please be careful.

254
00:23:40,587 --> 00:23:44,049
- They started yet?
- Only Councillor Hamann's opening prayer.

255
00:23:44,132 --> 00:23:47,261
Tonight, let us honor
these men and women.

256
00:23:47,469 --> 00:23:50,055
These are our soldiers, our warriors.

257
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:54,476
These are our husbands and wives,
our brothers and sisters...

258
00:23:54,643 --> 00:23:56,311
...our children.

259
00:23:56,854 --> 00:23:59,982
Let us remember those
that have been lost...

260
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:03,402
...and let us give thanks
for those that have been found...

261
00:24:03,527 --> 00:24:06,864
...and who stand here beside us.

262
00:24:07,072 --> 00:24:10,742
Now I would like someone else
to close this prayer...

263
00:24:10,909 --> 00:24:14,079
...someone who hasn't spoken here
in a long time...

264
00:24:14,246 --> 00:24:19,668
...but who I believe has something to say
that we all need to hear.

265
00:24:20,627 --> 00:24:22,171
I give you Morpheus.

266
00:24:41,773 --> 00:24:45,944
Zion! Hear me!

267
00:24:46,904 --> 00:24:50,032
It is true what many of you have heard.

268
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:54,203
The machines have gathered
an army, and as I speak...

269
00:24:54,411 --> 00:24:58,290
...that army is drawing nearer
to our home.

270
00:24:59,833 --> 00:25:04,421
Believe me when I say we have
a difficult time ahead of us.

271
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:11,303
But if we are to be prepared for it,
we must first shed our fear of it.

272
00:25:11,803 --> 00:25:16,725
I stand here before you now
truthfully unafraid.

273
00:25:17,351 --> 00:25:19,019
Why?

274
00:25:19,436 --> 00:25:22,231
Because I believe something you do not?

275
00:25:22,481 --> 00:25:24,316
No!

276
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:29,571
I stand here without fear
because I remember.

277
00:25:29,738 --> 00:25:33,617
I remember that I am here not because
of the path that lies before me...

278
00:25:33,825 --> 00:25:37,162
...but because of the path
that lies behind me.

279
00:25:37,371 --> 00:25:41,959
I remember that for 100 years
we have fought these machines.

280
00:25:42,167 --> 00:25:46,839
I remember that for 100 years
they have sent their armies to destroy us.

281
00:25:47,089 --> 00:25:53,095
And after a century of war,
I remember that which matters most:

282
00:25:54,054 --> 00:25:57,099
We are still here!

283
00:26:03,772 --> 00:26:05,858
Tonight...

284
00:26:06,024 --> 00:26:09,361
...let us send a message to that army.

285
00:26:09,611 --> 00:26:12,614
Tonight, let us shake this cave.

286
00:26:12,823 --> 00:26:16,702
Tonight, let us tremble these halls...

287
00:26:16,785 --> 00:26:19,913
...of earth, steel and stone.

288
00:26:20,122 --> 00:26:25,335
Let us be heard from red core
to black sky.

289
00:26:25,544 --> 00:26:30,048
Tonight, let us make them remember:

290
00:26:30,215 --> 00:26:35,220
This is Zion and we are not afraid!

291
00:26:58,577 --> 00:27:00,579
I remember.

292
00:27:01,413 --> 00:27:03,832
I remember you used to dance.

293
00:27:05,501 --> 00:27:08,712
I remember you were pretty good.

294
00:27:09,546 --> 00:27:12,758
There are some things in this world,
Captain Niobe...

295
00:27:13,509 --> 00:27:16,345
...that will never change.

296
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:19,556
Niobe!

297
00:27:24,269 --> 00:27:26,021
Some things do change.

298
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:47,084
Excuse me.

299
00:27:58,971 --> 00:28:02,391
- I missed you.
- I can tell.

300
00:28:02,933 --> 00:28:06,562
I was thinking, everyone is here.

301
00:28:07,229 --> 00:28:09,481
Follow me.

302
00:31:30,432 --> 00:31:34,102
Neo, what is it?

303
00:31:34,394 --> 00:31:36,605
What's wrong?

304
00:31:38,148 --> 00:31:40,526
It's okay, you can tell me.

305
00:31:40,859 --> 00:31:43,362
Trinity...

306
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:46,365
Don't be afraid.

307
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:48,867
I can't lose you.

308
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:50,869
You're not gonna lose me.

309
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:57,876
You feel this?

310
00:31:58,043 --> 00:31:59,837
I'm never letting go.

311
00:32:37,082 --> 00:32:39,751
Good night, Zion.

312
00:32:39,877 --> 00:32:42,588
Sweet dreams.

313
00:32:52,806 --> 00:32:54,349
- You all right?
- I'll make it.

314
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:57,186
Did you see that agent?
I've never seen anything like that.

315
00:32:57,394 --> 00:32:59,479
It doesn't matter.
All that matters is this.

316
00:32:59,688 --> 00:33:01,857
You first.

317
00:33:12,826 --> 00:33:15,621
- Oh, God.
- "Smith" will suffice.

318
00:33:27,633 --> 00:33:31,470
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

319
00:34:20,936 --> 00:34:24,147
- Care for some company?
- Councillor Hamann.

320
00:34:25,107 --> 00:34:27,901
I don't want to intrude
if you'd prefer to be alone.

321
00:34:28,318 --> 00:34:31,864
- No, I could probably use some company.
- Good.

322
00:34:32,364 --> 00:34:34,700
So could I.

323
00:34:37,911 --> 00:34:40,289
It's nice tonight.

324
00:34:40,831 --> 00:34:43,208
Very calm.

325
00:34:43,458 --> 00:34:46,128
It feels like everyone is sleeping
very peacefully.

326
00:34:46,545 --> 00:34:49,047
Not everyone.

327
00:34:49,381 --> 00:34:54,052
I hate sleeping.
I never sleep more than a few hours.

328
00:34:54,178 --> 00:34:58,223
I figure I slept the first 11 years
of my life, now I'm making up for it.

329
00:34:58,765 --> 00:35:03,478
- What about you?
- I just haven't been able to sleep much.

330
00:35:04,897 --> 00:35:08,066
- It's a good sign.
- Of what?

331
00:35:08,233 --> 00:35:11,403
That you are in fact still human.

332
00:35:15,032 --> 00:35:18,911
Have you ever been
to the engineering level?

333
00:35:19,077 --> 00:35:22,122
I love to walk there at night.
It's quite amazing.

334
00:35:22,331 --> 00:35:24,833
- Would you like to see it?
- Sure.

335
00:35:35,469 --> 00:35:39,932
Almost no one comes down here.
Unless, of course, there's a problem.

336
00:35:40,182 --> 00:35:45,187
That's how it is with people. Nobody
cares how it works as long as it works.

337
00:35:45,354 --> 00:35:47,689
I like it down here.

338
00:35:47,856 --> 00:35:53,612
I like to be reminded this city survives
because of these machines.

339
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:58,951
These machines are keeping us alive while
other machines are coming to kill us.

340
00:35:59,368 --> 00:36:04,122
Interesting, isn't it?
The power to give life...

341
00:36:04,373 --> 00:36:07,584
...and the power to end it.
- We have the same power.

342
00:36:07,793 --> 00:36:10,379
Yeah, I suppose we do, but...

343
00:36:10,629 --> 00:36:14,049
...sometimes I think about those people
still plugged into the Matrix.

344
00:36:14,258 --> 00:36:17,302
And when I look at these machines...

345
00:36:17,386 --> 00:36:22,474
...I can't help thinking that, in a way,
we are plugged into them.

346
00:36:22,808 --> 00:36:25,644
But we control these machines,
they don't control us.

347
00:36:26,144 --> 00:36:29,064
Of course not. How could they?

348
00:36:29,273 --> 00:36:31,775
The idea is pure nonsense...

349
00:36:32,317 --> 00:36:35,404
...but it does make one wonder just...

350
00:36:35,654 --> 00:36:37,197
...what is control?

351
00:36:37,406 --> 00:36:40,409
If we wanted, we could
shut these machines down.

352
00:36:40,826 --> 00:36:45,330
Of course. That's it. You hit it.
That's control, isn't it?

353
00:36:45,956 --> 00:36:49,293
If we wanted,
we could smash them to bits.

354
00:36:49,585 --> 00:36:53,672
Although if we did, we'd have to consider
what would happen to our lights...

355
00:36:53,881 --> 00:36:56,592
...our heat, our air.

356
00:36:57,509 --> 00:37:01,680
So we need machines and they need us.
Is that your point, councillor?

357
00:37:01,805 --> 00:37:04,433
No. No point.

358
00:37:05,142 --> 00:37:09,188
Old men like me don't bother
with making points. There's no point.

359
00:37:10,022 --> 00:37:13,775
Is that why there are no young men
on the Council?

360
00:37:14,026 --> 00:37:15,694
Good point.

361
00:37:16,403 --> 00:37:20,574
Why don't you tell me
what's on your mind, councillor.

362
00:37:20,782 --> 00:37:24,036
There is so much in this world...

363
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:27,039
...that I do not understand.

364
00:37:28,916 --> 00:37:33,629
See that machine? It has something to do
with recycling our water supply.

365
00:37:33,795 --> 00:37:36,715
I have absolutely no idea how it works.

366
00:37:36,965 --> 00:37:41,011
But I do understand the reason
for it to work.

367
00:37:42,554 --> 00:37:47,059
I have absolutely no idea how you
are able to do some of the things you do.

368
00:37:48,227 --> 00:37:51,313
But I believe there's a reason for that
as well.

369
00:37:52,272 --> 00:37:57,402
I only hope we understand that reason
before it's too late.

370
00:38:03,951 --> 00:38:05,494
- Ballard.
- Is he here?

371
00:38:07,996 --> 00:38:10,499
Neo, it's from the Oracle.

372
00:38:13,544 --> 00:38:15,212
It's time to go.

373
00:38:16,255 --> 00:38:18,674
Morpheus said this was how
it was gonna happen.

374
00:38:18,841 --> 00:38:23,262
I don't know. Maybe the prophecy's true,
maybe it's not.

375
00:38:23,762 --> 00:38:27,015
All I know is, that ship needs an operator.

376
00:38:28,559 --> 00:38:30,435
Right now, that operator's me.

377
00:38:31,061 --> 00:38:33,146
I know.

378
00:38:38,151 --> 00:38:39,695
- Zee...
- I want you to wear it.

379
00:38:39,945 --> 00:38:43,031
- You know I don't believe in this stuff.
- But I do.

380
00:38:43,365 --> 00:38:46,285
It's always brought me luck.

381
00:38:46,493 --> 00:38:50,539
- Maybe it'll bring me you.
- I'm coming back.

382
00:38:50,789 --> 00:38:55,252
I promise. No matter what it takes,
I'm coming home.

383
00:38:55,961 --> 00:38:59,631
Just keep it with you. Please.

384
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,800
For me.

385
00:39:04,303 --> 00:39:06,638
Okay.

386
00:39:26,116 --> 00:39:28,202
- Neo!
- How the hell...?

387
00:39:28,619 --> 00:39:30,829
Bane.

388
00:39:30,996 --> 00:39:32,247
Is something wrong?

389
00:39:32,497 --> 00:39:34,166
No, I'm fine.

390
00:39:34,333 --> 00:39:37,169
I just wanted to catch you to say...

391
00:39:37,377 --> 00:39:39,171
...good luck.

392
00:39:40,839 --> 00:39:42,508
Thanks.

393
00:39:42,674 --> 00:39:45,093
We'll see you.

394
00:39:46,762 --> 00:39:49,765
Neo! Just in time.

395
00:39:50,015 --> 00:39:52,267
- You're gonna see the Oracle?
- There's no time.

396
00:39:52,518 --> 00:39:54,061
I had to give something to Neo.

397
00:39:54,770 --> 00:39:57,523
A gift from one of the orphans.

398
00:39:57,689 --> 00:40:01,026
He made me swear to get it to you
before you left.

399
00:40:01,985 --> 00:40:04,363
He said you'd understand.

400
00:40:07,115 --> 00:40:09,201
Thanks.

401
00:40:16,375 --> 00:40:19,211
I was just told you cleared
the <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i> for takeoff.

402
00:40:19,378 --> 00:40:21,380
That is correct.

403
00:40:21,588 --> 00:40:23,465
Am I still in charge
of our defense system?

404
00:40:23,674 --> 00:40:24,925
Of course.

405
00:40:25,634 --> 00:40:29,721
I believe I need every ship we have
if we're going to survive this attack.

406
00:40:30,347 --> 00:40:32,432
I understand that, commander.

407
00:40:32,641 --> 00:40:35,227
Then why did you allow
the <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i> to leave?

408
00:40:35,352 --> 00:40:40,232
Because I believe our survival depends
on more than how many ships we have.

409
00:40:42,734 --> 00:40:45,070
Be careful.

410
00:41:14,141 --> 00:41:16,351
Hello.

411
00:41:26,653 --> 00:41:30,115
- You seek the Oracle.
- Who are you?

412
00:41:33,202 --> 00:41:37,706
I am Seraph. I can take you to her,
but first I must apologize.

413
00:41:37,915 --> 00:41:39,708
Apologize for what?

414
00:41:40,292 --> 00:41:42,085
For this.

415
00:42:39,434 --> 00:42:41,603
Good.

416
00:42:44,231 --> 00:42:47,359
The Oracle has many enemies.
I had to be sure.

417
00:42:47,568 --> 00:42:49,778
- Of what?
- That you are the One.

418
00:42:50,195 --> 00:42:53,949
- You could have just asked.
- No. You do not truly know someone...

419
00:42:54,116 --> 00:42:56,326
...until you fight them.

420
00:42:56,952 --> 00:43:00,372
Come. She's waiting.

421
00:43:15,387 --> 00:43:17,306
Where the hell did they go?

422
00:43:17,723 --> 00:43:20,392
These are back doors, aren't they?

423
00:43:20,517 --> 00:43:23,437
Programmer access.

424
00:43:24,563 --> 00:43:28,317
- How do they work?
- A code is hidden in tumblers.

425
00:43:28,442 --> 00:43:33,447
One position opens a lock and another
position opens one of these doors.

426
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:38,035
Are you a programmer?

427
00:43:38,243 --> 00:43:40,537
Then what are you?

428
00:43:42,748 --> 00:43:46,251
I protect that which matters most.

429
00:44:05,771 --> 00:44:09,107
Well, come on. I ain't gonna bite you.

430
00:44:09,525 --> 00:44:12,361
Come around here
and let me have a look at you.

431
00:44:15,572 --> 00:44:17,950
My goodness, look at you.

432
00:44:18,283 --> 00:44:21,119
You turned out all right, didn't you?

433
00:44:21,286 --> 00:44:23,497
- How do you feel?
- L...

434
00:44:23,705 --> 00:44:27,251
I know you're not sleeping.
We'll get to that.

435
00:44:27,459 --> 00:44:30,045
Why don't you come
and have a sit this time.

436
00:44:30,796 --> 00:44:34,967
- Maybe I'll stand.
- Well, suit yourself.

437
00:44:46,144 --> 00:44:48,647
- I felt like sitting.
- I know.

438
00:44:49,773 --> 00:44:51,733
So...

439
00:44:53,819 --> 00:44:56,238
...let's get the obvious stuff
out of the way.

440
00:44:56,572 --> 00:45:00,909
- You're not human, are you?
- It's tough to get more obvious than that.

441
00:45:01,159 --> 00:45:06,999
If I had to guess, I'd say you're
a program from the machine world.

442
00:45:07,416 --> 00:45:11,587
- So is he.
- So far, so good.

443
00:45:11,753 --> 00:45:14,923
But if that's true, that could mean
you're part of this system...

444
00:45:15,090 --> 00:45:17,593
...another kind of control.

445
00:45:17,843 --> 00:45:22,306
- Keep going.
- I suppose the most obvious question is...

446
00:45:22,514 --> 00:45:26,351
...how can I trust you?
- Bingo.

447
00:45:27,519 --> 00:45:30,772
It is a pickle, no doubt about it.
Bad news is...

448
00:45:30,856 --> 00:45:34,526
...there's no way you can really know
if I'm here to help you or not.

449
00:45:34,693 --> 00:45:38,280
So it's really up to you. Just have
to make up your own damn mind...

450
00:45:38,447 --> 00:45:43,285
...to either accept what
I'm going to tell you or reject it.

451
00:45:44,536 --> 00:45:46,705
Candy?

452
00:45:49,416 --> 00:45:53,795
- Do you already know if I'll take it?
- Wouldn't be much of an oracle if I didn't.

453
00:45:54,004 --> 00:45:57,216
But if you already know,
how can I make a choice?

454
00:45:57,341 --> 00:46:01,386
Because you didn't come here to make
the choice. You've already made it.

455
00:46:01,637 --> 00:46:06,225
You're here to try to understand
why you made it.

456
00:46:11,730 --> 00:46:14,733
I thought you'd have figured that out
by now.

457
00:46:16,527 --> 00:46:19,029
- Why are you here?
- Same reason.

458
00:46:19,321 --> 00:46:22,074
I love candy.

459
00:46:22,241 --> 00:46:25,077
But why help us?

460
00:46:25,285 --> 00:46:28,747
We're all here to do
what we're all here to do.

461
00:46:29,248 --> 00:46:32,376
I'm interested in one thing, Neo:
The future.

462
00:46:32,584 --> 00:46:36,755
And believe me, I know, the only way
to get there is together.

463
00:46:37,589 --> 00:46:42,511
- Are there other programs like you?
- Well, not like me, but...

464
00:46:42,678 --> 00:46:45,305
Look. See those birds?

465
00:46:45,597 --> 00:46:48,934
At some point, a program was written
to govern them.

466
00:46:49,184 --> 00:46:55,023
A program was written to watch over the
trees and the wind, the sunrise and sunset.

467
00:46:55,190 --> 00:46:58,110
There are programs running
all over the place.

468
00:46:58,235 --> 00:47:02,698
The ones doing their job, doing what
they were meant to do, are invisible.

469
00:47:02,948 --> 00:47:06,702
You'd never even know they were here.
But the other ones...

470
00:47:06,869 --> 00:47:10,956
Well, you hear about them all the time.

471
00:47:11,582 --> 00:47:14,376
- I've never heard of them.
- Of course you have.

472
00:47:14,626 --> 00:47:19,506
Every time you've heard someone
say they saw a ghost or an angel...

473
00:47:19,715 --> 00:47:24,303
...every story you've ever heard about
vampires, werewolves or aliens...

474
00:47:24,511 --> 00:47:26,805
...is the system assimilating
some program...

475
00:47:27,014 --> 00:47:31,602
...that's doing something
they're not supposed to be doing.

476
00:47:31,810 --> 00:47:34,813
Programs hacking programs.

477
00:47:34,938 --> 00:47:37,858
- Why?
- They have their reasons...

478
00:47:38,066 --> 00:47:41,904
...but usually a program chooses exile
when it faces deletion.

479
00:47:42,446 --> 00:47:46,325
- And why would a program be deleted?
- Maybe it breaks down.

480
00:47:46,491 --> 00:47:50,996
Maybe a better program is created
to replace it. Happens all the time.

481
00:47:51,205 --> 00:47:56,084
And when it does, a program
can either choose to hide here...

482
00:47:56,335 --> 00:47:59,004
...or return to the source.

483
00:48:00,672 --> 00:48:03,926
- The machine mainframe.
- Yes.

484
00:48:04,134 --> 00:48:06,637
Where you must go.

485
00:48:06,845 --> 00:48:11,016
Where the path of the One ends.
You've seen it...

486
00:48:12,184 --> 00:48:14,978
...in your dreams, haven't you?

487
00:48:15,187 --> 00:48:18,023
A door made of light?

488
00:48:20,275 --> 00:48:23,862
What happens when you go through
the door?

489
00:48:25,948 --> 00:48:28,951
I see Trinity...

490
00:48:29,159 --> 00:48:32,287
...and something happens...

491
00:48:32,496 --> 00:48:34,373
...something bad.

492
00:48:34,581 --> 00:48:38,544
She starts to fall,
and then I wake up.

493
00:48:39,586 --> 00:48:43,465
- Do you see her die?
- No.

494
00:48:44,299 --> 00:48:47,302
You have the sight now, Neo.

495
00:48:47,511 --> 00:48:50,430
You are looking at the world
without time.

496
00:48:50,639 --> 00:48:53,058
Then why can't I see
what happens to her?

497
00:48:53,225 --> 00:48:56,979
We can never see past the choices
we don't understand.

498
00:48:57,104 --> 00:49:00,315
Are you saying I have to choose
whether Trinity lives or dies?

499
00:49:00,566 --> 00:49:04,319
No, you've already made the choice.

500
00:49:04,486 --> 00:49:06,989
Now you have to understand it.

501
00:49:07,739 --> 00:49:09,074
No.

502
00:49:09,199 --> 00:49:12,411
I can't do that. I won't.

503
00:49:13,161 --> 00:49:15,581
- Well, you have to.
- Why?

504
00:49:16,164 --> 00:49:19,209
Because you're the One.

505
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:24,423
What if I can't?

506
00:49:24,631 --> 00:49:26,592
What happens if I fail?

507
00:49:27,134 --> 00:49:30,179
Then Zion will fall.

508
00:49:37,686 --> 00:49:42,441
Our time is up. Listen to me, Neo.
You can save Zion...

509
00:49:42,691 --> 00:49:46,028
...if you reach the source, but to do that
you need the Keymaker.

510
00:49:46,111 --> 00:49:47,154
The Keymaker?

511
00:49:47,362 --> 00:49:51,033
He disappeared. We didn't
know what happened to him until now.

512
00:49:51,116 --> 00:49:54,870
He's being held prisoner
by a very dangerous program...

513
00:49:55,078 --> 00:49:58,624
...one of the oldest of us.
He is called the Merovingian.

514
00:49:58,832 --> 00:50:01,627
- And he won't let him go willingly.
- What does he want?

515
00:50:01,877 --> 00:50:06,632
What do all men with power want?
More power.

516
00:50:07,382 --> 00:50:10,636
Be there at that exact time...

517
00:50:10,802 --> 00:50:13,430
...and you will have a chance.

518
00:50:14,264 --> 00:50:16,475
We must go.

519
00:50:16,642 --> 00:50:22,064
Seems like every time we meet
I got nothing but bad news.

520
00:50:22,606 --> 00:50:25,526
I'm sorry about that. I surely am.

521
00:50:25,734 --> 00:50:28,445
But for what it's worth...

522
00:50:29,488 --> 00:50:33,158
...you've made a believer out of me.

523
00:50:34,493 --> 00:50:36,578
Good luck, kiddo.

524
00:50:56,515 --> 00:50:59,434
Mr. Anderson.

525
00:51:00,561 --> 00:51:02,521
Did you get my package?

526
00:51:02,646 --> 00:51:04,857
- Yeah.
- Well, good.

527
00:51:05,983 --> 00:51:08,902
- Smith?
- He's not reading like an agent.

528
00:51:09,111 --> 00:51:12,948
- Surprised to see me?
- No.

529
00:51:13,282 --> 00:51:15,701
- Then you're aware of it.
- Of what?

530
00:51:16,952 --> 00:51:18,912
Our connection.

531
00:51:19,121 --> 00:51:21,707
I don't fully understand how it happened.

532
00:51:21,957 --> 00:51:25,294
Perhaps some part of you
imprinted onto me...

533
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:28,088
...something overwritten or copied.

534
00:51:28,297 --> 00:51:31,008
It is, at this point, irrelevant.
What matters is...

535
00:51:31,216 --> 00:51:34,219
...that whatever happened,
happened for a reason.

536
00:51:34,469 --> 00:51:36,138
And what reason is that?

537
00:51:36,555 --> 00:51:40,475
I killed you, Mr. Anderson.
I watched you die.

538
00:51:40,726 --> 00:51:43,937
With a certain satisfaction,
I might add.

539
00:51:44,146 --> 00:51:47,566
And then something happened,
something that I knew was impossible...

540
00:51:47,816 --> 00:51:49,568
...but it happened anyway.

541
00:51:50,319 --> 00:51:53,405
You destroyed me, Mr. Anderson.

542
00:51:55,490 --> 00:52:00,078
Afterward, I knew the rules, I understood
what I was supposed to do...

543
00:52:00,204 --> 00:52:03,248
...but I didn't.

544
00:52:03,665 --> 00:52:07,586
I couldn't. I was compelled to stay...

545
00:52:08,003 --> 00:52:11,590
...compelled to disobey.

546
00:52:12,174 --> 00:52:15,928
And now, here I stand
because of you, Mr. Anderson.

547
00:52:16,053 --> 00:52:20,015
Because of you, I'm no longer an agent
of this system.

548
00:52:20,224 --> 00:52:23,435
Because of you, I've changed.
I'm unplugged.

549
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:28,440
A new man, so to speak.
Like you, apparently free.

550
00:52:28,774 --> 00:52:30,108
Congratulations.

551
00:52:30,859 --> 00:52:33,278
Thank you.

552
00:52:33,779 --> 00:52:38,450
But as you well know,
appearances can be deceiving...

553
00:52:38,575 --> 00:52:43,789
...which brings me back to the reason
why we're here.

554
00:52:43,997 --> 00:52:48,794
We're not here because we're free.
We're here because we are not free.

555
00:52:49,002 --> 00:52:52,881
There's no escaping reason,
no denying purpose.

556
00:52:53,048 --> 00:52:56,385
Because as we both know,
without purpose...

557
00:52:56,635 --> 00:53:01,390
...we would not exist.
- It is purpose that created us.

558
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:04,643
- Purpose that connects us.
- Purpose that pulls us.

559
00:53:04,852 --> 00:53:06,645
- That guides us.
- That drives us.

560
00:53:06,812 --> 00:53:11,525
- It is purpose that defines.
- Purpose that binds us.

561
00:53:11,733 --> 00:53:14,152
We are here because of you,
Mr. Anderson.

562
00:53:14,319 --> 00:53:18,740
We're here to take from you
what you tried to take from us:

563
00:53:20,701 --> 00:53:22,661
Purpose.

564
00:53:25,831 --> 00:53:27,666
- What's happening to him?
- Don't know.

565
00:53:30,711 --> 00:53:34,339
Yes, that's it. It'll be over soon.

566
00:55:21,238 --> 00:55:23,615
- You.
- Yes, me.

567
00:55:27,786 --> 00:55:30,706
Me, me, me.

568
00:55:35,627 --> 00:55:37,212
Me too.

569
00:57:45,007 --> 00:57:46,091
More.

570
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:51,156
It is inevitable.

571
00:58:51,573 --> 00:58:52,991
Come on, get out of there.

572
00:59:36,201 --> 00:59:38,453
Are you all right?

573
00:59:39,621 --> 00:59:41,498
- It was Smith.
- Yes.

574
00:59:42,457 --> 00:59:45,043
- Now there's more than one of them?
- A lot more.

575
00:59:45,252 --> 00:59:49,006
- How is that possible?
- I don't know.

576
00:59:49,214 --> 00:59:51,633
Somehow, he's found a way
to copy himself.

577
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:55,971
- Is that what he was doing to you?
- I don't know what he was doing...

578
00:59:56,221 --> 00:59:58,891
...but I know what it felt like.
- What?

579
00:59:59,850 --> 01:00:03,478
It felt like I was back in that hallway.

580
01:00:03,729 --> 01:00:05,147
It felt like dying.

581
01:00:05,689 --> 01:00:08,483
The machines are tunneling to avoid
our defense system.

582
01:00:08,734 --> 01:00:12,487
But I believe they will intersect
certain pipelines to control them.

583
01:00:12,654 --> 01:00:15,157
These points of intersection
are crucial...

584
01:00:15,407 --> 01:00:18,202
...because I believe they're
vulnerable to counterattack.

585
01:00:18,410 --> 01:00:22,372
Although it has been suggested that
this is the same kind of attack...

586
01:00:22,581 --> 01:00:26,251
...we've defended for years,
I urge the Council to realize the truth.

587
01:00:26,418 --> 01:00:29,755
This is the single greatest threat
we have ever faced...

588
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:33,759
...and if we do not act accordingly,
we will not survive.

589
01:00:33,926 --> 01:00:37,930
Commander Lock, the Council is well
aware of the seriousness of this attack.

590
01:00:38,222 --> 01:00:42,684
You have our leave to prepare our defense
by any and all means necessary.

591
01:00:42,935 --> 01:00:45,604
- Thank you, Council.
- However...

592
01:00:45,854 --> 01:00:49,191
...we ask if there's been word
from the <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i>.

593
01:00:49,483 --> 01:00:51,860
No, councillor. No word. Nothing.

594
01:00:53,529 --> 01:00:57,533
Then we request a ship be dispatched
to ascertain the fate of the One.

595
01:00:57,699 --> 01:01:01,453
I wish that were possible, councillor,
but I do not believe our defense...

596
01:01:01,578 --> 01:01:05,123
...can suffer the loss of another ship.
- It will, commander, if it must.

597
01:01:05,332 --> 01:01:07,626
It could take one ship days
to find the <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i>.

598
01:01:07,835 --> 01:01:10,879
- Then send two.
- This is insane.

599
01:01:11,046 --> 01:01:13,966
Careful, commander.

600
01:01:14,299 --> 01:01:17,553
Forgive my frustration, councillors.

601
01:01:17,719 --> 01:01:21,598
But I wish I were able to comprehend
the Council's choice in this matter.

602
01:01:21,807 --> 01:01:24,935
Comprehension is not
a requisite of cooperation.

603
01:01:25,143 --> 01:01:27,563
If you are asking me
to order two of my captains...

604
01:01:27,729 --> 01:01:29,398
There's no need for such an order.

605
01:01:29,648 --> 01:01:33,151
The captains are present.
They can answer for themselves.

606
01:01:33,694 --> 01:01:38,907
The Council is calling for two volunteers
to aid the <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i>.

607
01:01:39,116 --> 01:01:43,161
Are there two among you
that would answer such a call?

608
01:01:44,538 --> 01:01:48,292
Captain Soren of the <i>Vigilant</i>
will answer the Council's call.

609
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:51,420
You understand the situation,
Captain Soren?

610
01:01:51,628 --> 01:01:54,006
- Yes, ma'am.
- Thank you, captain.

611
01:01:55,507 --> 01:01:56,842
Is there another?

612
01:01:57,676 --> 01:02:01,346
- Captain, I think we should volunteer.
- What? You have gone crazy.

613
01:02:01,513 --> 01:02:03,432
- Listen...
- Shut your hole, Bane...

614
01:02:03,599 --> 01:02:05,100
...before I put you in one.

615
01:02:14,985 --> 01:02:16,653
Is there no other?

616
01:02:17,487 --> 01:02:19,364
Be hard for any man to risk his life...

617
01:02:19,573 --> 01:02:22,492
...especially if he doesn't
understand the reason.

618
01:02:22,910 --> 01:02:26,455
Captain Niobe of the <i>Logos</i>
will answer the councillor's call.

619
01:02:26,663 --> 01:02:28,874
- What?
- Thank you, Captain Niobe.

620
01:02:29,041 --> 01:02:34,171
Commander Lock, you have your orders.
This Council is hereby adjourned.

621
01:02:38,884 --> 01:02:41,470
- Niobe, what are you doing?
- What I can.

622
01:02:41,678 --> 01:02:42,638
Why?

623
01:02:43,972 --> 01:02:47,226
Because some things
never change, Jason...

624
01:02:47,392 --> 01:02:49,728
...and some things do.

625
01:03:06,161 --> 01:03:07,538
What can you see, Neo?

626
01:03:07,746 --> 01:03:10,040
It's strange.
The code is somehow different.

627
01:03:10,249 --> 01:03:11,834
- Encrypted?
- Maybe.

628
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,919
Is that good for us or bad for us?

629
01:03:14,628 --> 01:03:17,756
Well, it looks like every floor
is wired with explosives.

630
01:03:18,382 --> 01:03:19,925
Bad for us.

631
01:03:20,342 --> 01:03:21,844
Here we go.

632
01:03:29,852 --> 01:03:32,771
Yes. We are here to speak
with the Merovingian.

633
01:03:33,272 --> 01:03:37,025
Well, of course.
He has been expecting you.

634
01:03:37,276 --> 01:03:38,277
Follow me.

635
01:04:00,299 --> 01:04:06,138
Here he is at last.
Neo, the One himself.

636
01:04:06,346 --> 01:04:07,723
Right?

637
01:04:07,890 --> 01:04:10,225
And the legendary Morpheus.

638
01:04:11,143 --> 01:04:15,939
And Trinity, of course.
I have heard so much.

639
01:04:16,148 --> 01:04:19,568
You honor me. Please, sit. Join us.
This is my wife, Persephone.

640
01:04:20,527 --> 01:04:23,739
Something to eat? Drink?

641
01:04:24,072 --> 01:04:27,075
Of course, such things are contrivances,
like so much here.

642
01:04:27,326 --> 01:04:29,828
For the sake of appearances.

643
01:04:29,995 --> 01:04:33,457
- No, thank you.
- Yes, of course. Who has time?

644
01:04:33,665 --> 01:04:38,670
Who has time? But then, if we do not ever
take time, how can we ever have time?

645
01:04:42,424 --> 01:04:45,761
Château Haut-Briond, 1959.
Magnificent wine.

646
01:04:45,969 --> 01:04:48,889
I love French wine
like I love the French language.

647
01:04:49,097 --> 01:04:53,185
I have sampled every language. French
is my favorite. Fantastic language...

648
01:04:53,352 --> 01:04:55,437
...especially to curse with.

649
01:04:59,525 --> 01:05:04,029
You see? It's like wiping your ass
with silk. I love it.

650
01:05:05,697 --> 01:05:07,449
You know why we are here.

651
01:05:09,201 --> 01:05:14,039
I am a trafficker of information.
I know everything I can.

652
01:05:14,540 --> 01:05:20,295
The question is,
do you know why you are here?

653
01:05:20,587 --> 01:05:23,090
We are looking for the Keymaker.

654
01:05:23,715 --> 01:05:28,220
Oh, yes, it is true.
The Keymaker, of course.

655
01:05:28,387 --> 01:05:31,306
But this is not a reason,
this is not a why.

656
01:05:31,557 --> 01:05:35,310
The Keymaker himself, his very nature,
is a means, it is not an end.

657
01:05:35,477 --> 01:05:41,233
And so to look for him is to be
looking for a means to do...

658
01:05:41,441 --> 01:05:44,570
...what?
- You know the answer to that question.

659
01:05:44,778 --> 01:05:46,864
But do you?

660
01:05:47,072 --> 01:05:49,366
You think you do, but you do not.

661
01:05:49,575 --> 01:05:52,828
You are here
because you were sent here.

662
01:05:52,911 --> 01:05:56,039
You were told to come here,
and then you obeyed.

663
01:05:57,291 --> 01:05:59,585
It is, of course, the way of all things.

664
01:05:59,793 --> 01:06:02,421
You see, there is only one constant...

665
01:06:02,588 --> 01:06:06,758
...one universal. It is the only real truth.

666
01:06:06,884 --> 01:06:08,552
Causality.

667
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:11,054
Action, reaction.

668
01:06:11,263 --> 01:06:15,434
- Cause and effect.
- Everything begins with choice.

669
01:06:15,642 --> 01:06:17,311
No. Wrong.

670
01:06:17,519 --> 01:06:22,107
Choice is an illusion created
between those with power...

671
01:06:22,316 --> 01:06:24,276
...and those without.

672
01:06:25,861 --> 01:06:29,114
Look there at that woman.

673
01:06:29,823 --> 01:06:33,702
My God, just look at her...

674
01:06:33,994 --> 01:06:36,622
...affecting everyone around her.

675
01:06:36,788 --> 01:06:41,502
So obvious, so bourgeois, so boring.
But wait.

676
01:06:41,793 --> 01:06:45,547
Watch. You see, I have sent her
a dessert...

677
01:06:45,797 --> 01:06:49,968
...a very special dessert.

678
01:06:54,306 --> 01:06:56,725
I wrote it myself.

679
01:06:56,934 --> 01:07:00,145
It starts so simply...

680
01:07:00,270 --> 01:07:04,858
...each line of the program creating
a new effect, just like...

681
01:07:05,901 --> 01:07:07,569
...poetry.

682
01:07:07,778 --> 01:07:09,154
First...

683
01:07:09,655 --> 01:07:15,077
...a rush, heat. Her heart flutters.

684
01:07:15,702 --> 01:07:18,330
You can see it, Neo, yes?

685
01:07:18,914 --> 01:07:21,416
She does not understand why.

686
01:07:21,750 --> 01:07:24,169
Is it the wine? No.

687
01:07:24,336 --> 01:07:26,672
What is it then? What is the reason?

688
01:07:27,381 --> 01:07:29,675
And soon it does not matter.

689
01:07:29,883 --> 01:07:32,803
Soon the why and the reason are gone...

690
01:07:33,846 --> 01:07:39,351
...and all that matters is the feeling itself.

691
01:07:39,768 --> 01:07:42,938
And this is the nature of the universe.

692
01:07:43,021 --> 01:07:45,607
We struggle against it,
we fight to deny it...

693
01:07:45,732 --> 01:07:48,360
...but it is, of course, pretense.
It is a lie.

694
01:07:48,527 --> 01:07:52,531
Beneath our poised appearance...

695
01:07:52,698 --> 01:07:57,953
...the truth is, we are completely...

696
01:08:00,873 --> 01:08:03,792
...out of control.

697
01:08:09,089 --> 01:08:13,969
Causality. There is no escape from it.
We are forever slaves to it.

698
01:08:14,386 --> 01:08:19,808
Our only hope, our only peace, is
to understand it, to understand the why.

699
01:08:20,058 --> 01:08:23,395
"Why" is what separates us from them...

700
01:08:23,562 --> 01:08:25,898
...you from me.

701
01:08:26,064 --> 01:08:29,818
"Why" is the only real source of power.
Without it, you are powerless.

702
01:08:29,943 --> 01:08:33,280
And this is how you come to me,
without why, without power.

703
01:08:33,488 --> 01:08:36,200
Another link in the chain.

704
01:08:36,408 --> 01:08:37,743
But fear not.

705
01:08:37,868 --> 01:08:41,747
Since I have seen how good you are
at following orders...

706
01:08:41,914 --> 01:08:44,541
...I will tell you what to do next.

707
01:08:45,083 --> 01:08:49,838
Run back and give the fortuneteller
this message:

708
01:08:50,172 --> 01:08:54,343
Her time is almost up.

709
01:08:55,385 --> 01:08:58,931
Now I have some real business to do,
so I will say <i>adieu</i> and goodbye.

710
01:08:59,139 --> 01:09:01,642
- This isn't over.
- Oh, yes, it is.

711
01:09:01,850 --> 01:09:08,190
The Keymaker is mine, and I see no
reason why I should give him up.

712
01:09:08,315 --> 01:09:12,361
- No reason at all.
- Where are you going?

713
01:09:12,611 --> 01:09:17,282
Please, <i>ma chérie</i>, I have told you.
We are all victims of causality.

714
01:09:17,491 --> 01:09:20,702
I drank too much wine,
I must take a piss.

715
01:09:21,245 --> 01:09:24,373
Cause and effect. <i>Au revoir</i>.

716
01:09:29,461 --> 01:09:32,506
Touch me and that hand
will never touch anything again.

717
01:09:41,473 --> 01:09:42,933
Well, that didn't go so well.

718
01:09:43,141 --> 01:09:45,435
Are you certain the Oracle
didn't say anything else?

719
01:09:45,644 --> 01:09:47,729
- Yes.
- Maybe we did something wrong.

720
01:09:48,480 --> 01:09:49,731
Or didn't do something.

721
01:09:49,898 --> 01:09:53,151
No, what happened couldn't have
happened any other way.

722
01:09:53,360 --> 01:09:57,114
- How do you know?
- We are still alive.

723
01:09:59,408 --> 01:10:02,661
If you want the Keymaker, follow me.

724
01:10:09,626 --> 01:10:11,712
Get out.

725
01:10:13,672 --> 01:10:19,928
I am so sick and tired of his bullshit.
On and on. Pompous prick.

726
01:10:20,596 --> 01:10:26,101
A long time ago, when we first
came here, it was so different.

727
01:10:27,853 --> 01:10:30,606
He was so different.

728
01:10:32,357 --> 01:10:34,943
He was like you.

729
01:10:37,696 --> 01:10:41,450
I'll give you what you want,
but you have to give me something.

730
01:10:42,284 --> 01:10:44,536
- What?
- A kiss.

731
01:10:44,870 --> 01:10:46,038
Excuse me?

732
01:10:47,581 --> 01:10:51,460
I want you to kiss me
as if you were kissing her.

733
01:10:53,420 --> 01:10:56,965
- Why?
- You love her. She loves you.

734
01:10:57,174 --> 01:10:59,134
It's all over you both.

735
01:10:59,885 --> 01:11:04,389
A long time ago,
I knew what that felt like.

736
01:11:05,724 --> 01:11:11,480
I want to remember it.
I want to sample it. That's all.

737
01:11:11,772 --> 01:11:13,565
Just a sample.

738
01:11:13,732 --> 01:11:16,652
- Why don't you sample this instead?
- Trinity.

739
01:11:18,987 --> 01:11:23,867
Such emotion over something so small.
It's just a kiss.

740
01:11:24,076 --> 01:11:26,245
Why should we trust you?

741
01:11:26,370 --> 01:11:30,415
If I don't deliver you to the Keymaker,
she can kill me.

742
01:11:37,506 --> 01:11:39,591
All right.

743
01:11:39,925 --> 01:11:43,762
But you have to make me believe
I am her.

744
01:11:44,930 --> 01:11:47,015
All right.

745
01:11:53,355 --> 01:11:55,148
Terrible. Forget it.

746
01:11:58,193 --> 01:11:59,611
Wait.

747
01:12:00,571 --> 01:12:02,030
Okay.

748
01:12:39,151 --> 01:12:41,236
Yes.

749
01:12:41,862 --> 01:12:44,239
That's it.

750
01:12:59,087 --> 01:13:04,510
I envy you. But such a thing
is not meant to last.

751
01:13:07,513 --> 01:13:08,847
Come with me.

752
01:13:39,962 --> 01:13:41,713
Not again.

753
01:13:45,133 --> 01:13:47,761
It's all right, boys. They're with me.

754
01:13:48,387 --> 01:13:50,806
These fellas work for my husband.

755
01:13:50,973 --> 01:13:54,726
They do his dirty work.
They're very good, very loyal.

756
01:13:54,977 --> 01:13:56,520
Aren't you, boys?

757
01:13:56,728 --> 01:13:57,646
Yes, mistress.

758
01:13:57,896 --> 01:14:00,566
They come from a much older version
of the Matrix.

759
01:14:00,816 --> 01:14:04,987
But like so many back then, they caused
more problems than they solved.

760
01:14:05,279 --> 01:14:10,284
My husband saved them because
they're notoriously difficult to terminate.

761
01:14:10,492 --> 01:14:14,454
How many people keep silver bullets
in their gun?

762
01:14:19,251 --> 01:14:22,379
You can either run and tell my husband
what I have done...

763
01:14:22,588 --> 01:14:25,174
...or you can stay there and die.

764
01:14:26,133 --> 01:14:28,010
He's in the ladies' room!

765
01:14:34,183 --> 01:14:36,018
Hurry.

766
01:15:01,585 --> 01:15:04,796
- My name is Neo.
- Yes. I'm the Keymaker.

767
01:15:04,922 --> 01:15:06,882
I've been waiting for you.

768
01:15:13,680 --> 01:15:17,434
My God! My God, Persephone,
how could you do this? You betray me.

769
01:15:21,730 --> 01:15:24,525
- Cause and effect, my love.
- Cause?

770
01:15:24,733 --> 01:15:27,736
There is no cause for this. What cause?

771
01:15:27,861 --> 01:15:32,241
What cause? How about the lipstick
you're still wearing?

772
01:15:32,324 --> 01:15:35,077
Lipstick? Lipstick.

773
01:15:35,244 --> 01:15:39,122
What craziness are you talking about,
woman? There is no lipstick!

774
01:15:40,791 --> 01:15:43,502
She wasn't kissing your face, my love.

775
01:15:45,921 --> 01:15:49,007
Woman, this is nothing.

776
01:15:49,258 --> 01:15:54,763
- It is a game. It is only a game.
- So is this.

777
01:15:54,972 --> 01:15:56,932
Have fun.

778
01:16:03,814 --> 01:16:05,482
All right.

779
01:16:05,732 --> 01:16:07,484
All right.

780
01:16:07,693 --> 01:16:10,487
Let us find out where this goes.

781
01:16:10,612 --> 01:16:13,532
You two, get the Keymaker.

782
01:16:19,997 --> 01:16:22,082
That's a nice trick.

783
01:16:22,165 --> 01:16:23,542
I cannot go back.

784
01:16:24,084 --> 01:16:26,044
I'll handle them.

785
01:16:26,587 --> 01:16:32,718
Handle us? You'll handle us? You know,
your predecessors had much more respect.

786
01:16:46,064 --> 01:16:48,150
Okay, you have some skill.

787
01:16:50,360 --> 01:16:52,321
Kill him.

788
01:17:52,506 --> 01:17:54,466
You see? He's just a man.

789
01:20:09,309 --> 01:20:12,104
Goddamn it, woman,
you will be the end of me.

790
01:20:14,189 --> 01:20:18,151
Mark my words, boy,
and mark them well.

791
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:23,574
I have survived your predecessors,
and I will survive you.

792
01:20:43,594 --> 01:20:47,014
- Where are you going?
- Another way. Always another way.

793
01:20:51,101 --> 01:20:52,978
Close it, quick!

794
01:20:57,774 --> 01:21:00,360
Could we move along?

795
01:21:03,947 --> 01:21:05,490
Run!

796
01:21:21,465 --> 01:21:23,717
Step away from the door.

797
01:21:28,847 --> 01:21:30,098
We owe you for that.

798
01:21:32,392 --> 01:21:33,560
Just like new.

799
01:21:33,852 --> 01:21:35,312
Drop your weapon.

800
01:21:40,734 --> 01:21:42,486
- Stay with him.
- What about Neo?

801
01:21:42,736 --> 01:21:44,279
He can handle himself.

802
01:21:47,324 --> 01:21:48,450
Get in back.

803
01:22:26,113 --> 01:22:27,239
Shit.

804
01:22:27,781 --> 01:22:29,199
- Operator.
- <i>Link, where am I?</i>

805
01:22:29,741 --> 01:22:32,953
You won't believe this,
but you're way up in the mountains.

806
01:22:33,287 --> 01:22:35,581
- Really?
- <i>It'll take me a while to get an exit.</i>

807
01:22:36,123 --> 01:22:37,124
- Shit!
- <i>What?</i>

808
01:22:37,374 --> 01:22:39,960
The twins are after Morpheus and Trinity.
They don't have a way out.

809
01:22:40,169 --> 01:22:43,505
- Where are they?
<i>- Middle of the city, 500 miles due south.</i>

810
01:23:00,314 --> 01:23:01,857
<i>- Operator.</i>
- Get us out of here.

811
01:23:02,065 --> 01:23:04,776
<i>- Won 't be easy.</i>
- I know. We're inside the core network.

812
01:23:04,985 --> 01:23:07,571
<i>The only exit I got</i>
<i>near you is the Winslow overpass.</i>

813
01:23:07,821 --> 01:23:09,907
- Off the freeway.
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>

814
01:23:09,990 --> 01:23:13,744
- Fine, we'll make it.
<i>- I should... Oh, shit! Look out behind you!</i>

815
01:23:18,749 --> 01:23:20,417
- Incoming fire.
- Down!

816
01:23:28,675 --> 01:23:29,801
Hold on!

817
01:23:46,777 --> 01:23:49,279
Oh, no. This is getting real ugly
real fast.

818
01:23:49,530 --> 01:23:51,198
Are you watching this, Link?

819
01:23:51,365 --> 01:23:55,035
Yes, sir. There's an all points on you.
Eight units headed your way.

820
01:23:56,078 --> 01:23:57,955
Any suggestions?

821
01:23:59,831 --> 01:24:01,917
- Turn right.
- Right, now.

822
01:24:09,299 --> 01:24:12,135
Straight here.
You'll hit a connecting tunnel to the 101.

823
01:24:12,344 --> 01:24:15,055
- <i>Got it.</i>
- You sure about this? The freeway, I mean.

824
01:24:15,264 --> 01:24:18,892
- In 14 years of operating, I've never seen...
- Link, what did I tell you?

825
01:24:19,226 --> 01:24:21,520
Yes, sir. I do, sir. Winslow overpass.

826
01:24:21,728 --> 01:24:24,231
- I'll be ready for you.
- Good man.

827
01:24:24,314 --> 01:24:26,525
You always told me
to stay off the freeway.

828
01:24:26,733 --> 01:24:29,319
- Yes, that's true.
- You said it was suicide.

829
01:24:29,570 --> 01:24:31,405
Then let us hope...

830
01:24:31,655 --> 01:24:32,990
...that I was wrong.

831
01:24:44,459 --> 01:24:45,919
- Operator.
- Link, it's Niobe.

832
01:24:46,128 --> 01:24:47,796
We've been sent to bring you in.

833
01:24:47,921 --> 01:24:51,008
- I need to talk to Morpheus.
- Believe me, Niobe, he needs you.

834
01:24:51,133 --> 01:24:53,218
- <i>Where is he?</i>
- Just follow the sirens.

835
01:25:00,726 --> 01:25:02,603
Repeat, they're approaching the...

836
01:25:05,856 --> 01:25:10,027
- We have them now.
- The exile is the primary target.

837
01:26:13,715 --> 01:26:14,675
<i>Shots fired.</i>

838
01:26:17,261 --> 01:26:19,137
Move!

839
01:28:09,122 --> 01:28:12,376
- We are getting aggravated.
- Yes, we are.

840
01:28:58,338 --> 01:29:00,340
Trinity.

841
01:29:00,757 --> 01:29:01,925
Get him out of here.

842
01:29:05,554 --> 01:29:07,639
Come on!

843
01:29:24,615 --> 01:29:26,200
Crush him.

844
01:29:56,647 --> 01:29:57,689
Morpheus.

845
01:29:57,898 --> 01:29:59,358
He's okay. Keep moving.

846
01:30:00,400 --> 01:30:02,152
Let's go.

847
01:30:07,908 --> 01:30:10,077
I need a download
to hot-wire a motorcycle.

848
01:30:10,202 --> 01:30:12,579
No problem.
One crash course on motorcycle...

849
01:30:12,704 --> 01:30:14,164
Wait.

850
01:30:15,499 --> 01:30:17,000
Cancel that.

851
01:30:17,167 --> 01:30:19,378
You are handy.

852
01:30:19,586 --> 01:30:21,463
Jump on.

853
01:32:48,694 --> 01:32:49,736
She means nothing.

854
01:32:49,945 --> 01:32:53,073
- Find the exile.
- We have them.

855
01:32:53,407 --> 01:32:55,576
<i>One-Adam- 12, please respond.</i>

856
01:33:02,040 --> 01:33:03,709
Get down.

857
01:35:14,673 --> 01:35:16,341
Gotcha.

858
01:35:17,050 --> 01:35:18,218
She's good.

859
01:35:22,598 --> 01:35:24,892
You are no longer necessary.

860
01:35:31,565 --> 01:35:35,235
We do only what we're meant to do.

861
01:35:36,904 --> 01:35:40,407
Then you are meant for one more thing:
Deletion.

862
01:35:41,366 --> 01:35:43,243
Go kick his ass.

863
01:36:33,293 --> 01:36:36,129
Neo, if you're out there,
I could use some help.

864
01:36:36,839 --> 01:36:38,298
What is that?

865
01:37:08,120 --> 01:37:11,039
Yes! Yes!

866
01:37:17,588 --> 01:37:19,798
We have confirmation from the <i>Icarus</i>.

867
01:37:19,923 --> 01:37:22,718
First two ships
are in position for counterattack.

868
01:37:23,010 --> 01:37:24,094
Good.

869
01:37:25,012 --> 01:37:26,054
Any change?

870
01:37:26,263 --> 01:37:28,974
They hit some iron ore here.
Slowed them down a little.

871
01:37:29,183 --> 01:37:32,311
- How much?
- An hour, maybe.

872
01:37:32,519 --> 01:37:35,022
That would give them
a little over nine hours.

873
01:37:35,856 --> 01:37:37,524
Yes, sir.

874
01:38:10,057 --> 01:38:12,351
<i>There is a building.</i>

875
01:38:12,559 --> 01:38:18,190
Inside this building, there is a level
where no elevator can go...

876
01:38:18,398 --> 01:38:20,275
...and no stair can reach.

877
01:38:20,901 --> 01:38:27,074
<i>This level is filled with doors.</i>
<i>These doors lead to many places.</i>

878
01:38:27,157 --> 01:38:29,576
Hidden places.

879
01:38:29,868 --> 01:38:33,497
But one door is special.

880
01:38:33,622 --> 01:38:35,916
One door leads to the source.

881
01:38:44,258 --> 01:38:48,637
This building is protected
by a very secure system.

882
01:38:48,846 --> 01:38:53,350
- Every alarm triggers the bomb.
- Bomb? Did he say bomb?

883
01:38:53,517 --> 01:38:56,270
But like all systems,
it has a weakness.

884
01:38:56,353 --> 01:38:59,356
The system is based on the rules
of a building.

885
01:38:59,606 --> 01:39:02,943
- One system built on another.
- Electricity.

886
01:39:03,443 --> 01:39:08,240
- Lf one fails, so must the other.
- No electricity, no alarms.

887
01:39:08,448 --> 01:39:11,285
You'd have to take out a city block
to kill the power.

888
01:39:11,368 --> 01:39:15,122
- Not one, 27.
- Twenty-seven blocks?

889
01:39:15,956 --> 01:39:18,458
<i>There is a power station.</i>

890
01:39:18,542 --> 01:39:20,878
<i>It must be destroyed.</i>

891
01:39:20,961 --> 01:39:25,340
- There must be some kind of fail-safe.
- Yes, there is an emergency system.

892
01:39:27,009 --> 01:39:30,762
<i>The core network of the grid</i>
<i>must be accessed.</i>

893
01:39:30,971 --> 01:39:33,807
<i>The emergency system</i>
<i>must be deactivated.</i>

894
01:39:33,891 --> 01:39:35,350
<i>What do you need us for?</i>

895
01:39:35,559 --> 01:39:37,644
Neo could take them out
easier than we could.

896
01:39:37,853 --> 01:39:39,646
- There's no time.
- Why?

897
01:39:39,730 --> 01:39:42,858
Once the door is unprotected,
the connection will be severed.

898
01:39:43,066 --> 01:39:45,360
But another connection
must first be made.

899
01:39:46,195 --> 01:39:50,073
<i>- How long will that take?</i>
<i>- Exactly 314 seconds.</i>

900
01:39:50,157 --> 01:39:51,825
<i>Just over five minutes.</i>

901
01:39:51,909 --> 01:39:54,244
<i>That is the length and breadth</i>
<i>of the window.</i>

902
01:39:54,328 --> 01:39:56,622
Only the One can open the door...

903
01:39:56,830 --> 01:39:59,750
...and only during that window
can the door be opened.

904
01:40:01,001 --> 01:40:02,669
How do you know all this?

905
01:40:02,753 --> 01:40:08,008
I know because I must know.
It is my purpose.

906
01:40:08,091 --> 01:40:13,597
It's the reason I'm here,
the same reason we're all here.

907
01:40:24,358 --> 01:40:27,194
Neo, I know something's wrong.

908
01:40:27,903 --> 01:40:29,863
You don't have to tell me.

909
01:40:30,113 --> 01:40:33,867
I just want you to know that I'm here.

910
01:40:37,371 --> 01:40:38,872
All must be done as one.

911
01:40:43,544 --> 01:40:45,212
Can't hurt.

912
01:40:48,757 --> 01:40:50,843
If one fails...

913
01:40:51,677 --> 01:40:53,345
<i>... all fail.</i>

914
01:40:53,762 --> 01:40:57,516
At midnight, there is a shift change
in the security of both buildings.

915
01:40:58,767 --> 01:41:02,229
<i>At midnight, we will strike.</i>

916
01:41:02,813 --> 01:41:03,897
Hey!

917
01:41:04,064 --> 01:41:08,068
- You count sheep at home.
- Why? I get paid to count them here.

918
01:41:18,161 --> 01:41:20,455
Okay, they're inside.

919
01:41:20,581 --> 01:41:23,083
- How much time?
- Twelve minutes.

920
01:41:25,752 --> 01:41:26,920
Oh, shit.

921
01:41:30,257 --> 01:41:35,679
All of our lives, we have fought this war.
Tonight, I believe we can end it.

922
01:41:37,264 --> 01:41:39,433
<i>Tonight is not an accident.</i>

923
01:41:40,684 --> 01:41:42,769
<i>There are no accidents.</i>

924
01:41:44,104 --> 01:41:49,109
We have not come here by chance.
I do not believe in chance.

925
01:41:49,359 --> 01:41:54,865
When I see three objectives,
three captains, three ships...

926
01:41:55,073 --> 01:41:58,619
...I do not see coincidence.
I see providence.

927
01:41:58,952 --> 01:42:01,205
<i>I see purpose.</i>

928
01:42:03,957 --> 01:42:10,297
I believe it is our fate to be here.
It is our destiny.

929
01:42:10,506 --> 01:42:15,511
I believe this night holds
for each and every one of us...

930
01:42:15,636 --> 01:42:18,972
...the very meaning of our lives.

931
01:42:19,139 --> 01:42:23,310
I want to ask you to do something,
but I don't know how.

932
01:42:23,852 --> 01:42:25,812
I promise you, if I can, I will.

933
01:42:27,189 --> 01:42:30,526
What if I asked you to stay out of this...

934
01:42:31,485 --> 01:42:33,445
...no matter what...

935
01:42:33,654 --> 01:42:35,948
...to stay out of the Matrix?

936
01:42:36,990 --> 01:42:38,867
Why?

937
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:48,168
Please.

938
01:42:50,254 --> 01:42:51,588
All right.

939
01:42:54,925 --> 01:42:57,427
What is it, Niobe?

940
01:42:57,511 --> 01:43:01,682
I can't help it, Morpheus. I can't
help thinking, what if you're wrong?

941
01:43:01,807 --> 01:43:05,143
What if all this, the prophecy,
everything, is bullshit?

942
01:43:05,352 --> 01:43:09,314
Then tomorrow we may all be dead.

943
01:43:09,731 --> 01:43:12,359
But how would that be different
from any other day?

944
01:43:21,827 --> 01:43:28,292
This is a war, and we are soldiers.

945
01:43:28,625 --> 01:43:31,545
<i>Death can come for us at any time...</i>

946
01:43:32,045 --> 01:43:33,797
<i>... in any place.</i>

947
01:43:34,047 --> 01:43:35,883
Incoming. Incoming!

948
01:43:37,885 --> 01:43:39,553
Incoming!

949
01:43:45,392 --> 01:43:47,895
Now consider the alternative.

950
01:43:48,103 --> 01:43:52,691
What if I am right?
What if the prophecy is true?

951
01:43:52,816 --> 01:43:57,279
What if tomorrow the war could be over?

952
01:43:58,238 --> 01:44:01,241
Isn't that worth fighting for?

953
01:44:02,284 --> 01:44:04,995
Isn't that worth dying for?

954
01:44:05,829 --> 01:44:08,540
- Time?
- Three minutes.

955
01:44:08,665 --> 01:44:09,791
Almost there.

956
01:44:29,811 --> 01:44:31,271
It is done.

957
01:44:31,355 --> 01:44:32,731
Find the others.

958
01:44:33,774 --> 01:44:36,068
I got Niobe there.
They're out of the station.

959
01:44:36,276 --> 01:44:38,862
- What about Soren?
- There.

960
01:44:39,112 --> 01:44:40,864
They're still inside, but...

961
01:44:41,782 --> 01:44:42,866
They're not moving.

962
01:45:06,932 --> 01:45:08,892
That's it, let's go.

963
01:45:10,978 --> 01:45:12,896
Call Neo now.

964
01:45:16,817 --> 01:45:19,653
- I lost them. They're inside the portal.
- What about the grid?

965
01:45:23,824 --> 01:45:27,244
Everything is operational.
The emergency system is rerouting power.

966
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:35,085
Jesus.

967
01:45:35,294 --> 01:45:39,339
Soon as they open that door,
it's all over.

968
01:45:39,464 --> 01:45:41,425
The hell it is.

969
01:45:42,176 --> 01:45:43,510
What are you...? Trinity!

970
01:45:44,887 --> 01:45:47,806
I will not wait and do nothing.
I will not watch them die.

971
01:45:48,015 --> 01:45:50,100
We're talking less than five minutes.

972
01:45:50,309 --> 01:45:52,811
In five minutes,
I'll tear that building down.

973
01:45:53,020 --> 01:45:56,565
- How much further?
- Here, just here.

974
01:45:57,816 --> 01:46:01,778
I'm sorry, this is a dead end.

975
01:46:03,030 --> 01:46:05,532
It's gotta be the ugliest hack
I have ever done.

976
01:46:08,660 --> 01:46:11,788
That's as close as I can get you.
You better grow wings.

977
01:46:29,932 --> 01:46:31,475
- Operator.
- <i>I'm in.</i>

978
01:46:31,600 --> 01:46:33,810
Keep moving. Sixty-fifth floor.

979
01:46:34,394 --> 01:46:38,565
You look surprised to see me again,
Mr. Anderson.

980
01:46:38,690 --> 01:46:44,112
Well, that's the difference between us.
I have been expecting you.

981
01:46:44,321 --> 01:46:47,241
- What do you want, Smith?
- You haven't figured that out?

982
01:46:47,324 --> 01:46:52,871
Still using all the muscles
except the one that matters.

983
01:46:53,080 --> 01:46:55,666
I want exactly what you want.

984
01:46:55,916 --> 01:46:58,001
I want everything.

985
01:46:58,418 --> 01:47:00,921
Would that include a bullet
from this gun?

986
01:47:01,088 --> 01:47:02,881
Go ahead, shoot.

987
01:47:03,090 --> 01:47:08,303
The best thing about being me,
there's so many me's.

988
01:47:19,773 --> 01:47:23,318
Christ! What the hell happened in here?

989
01:47:24,278 --> 01:47:26,238
Hold it right there, little lady.

990
01:47:35,622 --> 01:47:37,374
If you can't beat us...

991
01:47:37,624 --> 01:47:39,376
Join us.

992
01:47:41,545 --> 01:47:42,713
Morpheus!

993
01:47:56,268 --> 01:47:59,396
Still no sight of them.
They only got two minutes left.

994
01:48:13,076 --> 01:48:14,203
One minute.

995
01:48:23,378 --> 01:48:24,421
Come on.

996
01:48:25,672 --> 01:48:27,549
Come on.

997
01:48:28,175 --> 01:48:30,052
Please.

998
01:48:39,937 --> 01:48:41,522
Kill them.

999
01:48:49,363 --> 01:48:50,364
They're in.

1000
01:48:50,614 --> 01:48:52,574
<i>I don 't believe it.</i>

1001
01:49:08,131 --> 01:49:10,217
It was meant to be.

1002
01:49:10,384 --> 01:49:15,722
Morpheus, that door will take you home.

1003
01:49:24,481 --> 01:49:28,861
You will know which door.
Hurry, Neo.

1004
01:49:34,408 --> 01:49:37,494
Trinity, I got some serious activity
headed your way.

1005
01:50:29,880 --> 01:50:31,215
Hello, Neo.

1006
01:50:31,715 --> 01:50:35,594
- Who are you?
- I am the Architect.

1007
01:50:35,719 --> 01:50:39,348
I created the Matrix.
I've been waiting for you.

1008
01:50:39,556 --> 01:50:43,727
You have many questions. Though the
process has altered your consciousness...

1009
01:50:43,936 --> 01:50:45,896
...you remain irrevocably human.

1010
01:50:46,146 --> 01:50:49,650
Ergo, some of my answers you will
understand and some you will not.

1011
01:50:50,067 --> 01:50:54,154
Concordantly, while your first question
may be the most pertinent...

1012
01:50:54,363 --> 01:50:57,991
...you may or may not realize
it is also the most irrelevant.

1013
01:50:58,951 --> 01:51:00,494
Why am I here?

1014
01:51:00,744 --> 01:51:04,581
Your life is the sum of a remainder
of an unbalanced equation...

1015
01:51:04,790 --> 01:51:07,084
...inherent to the programming
of the Matrix.

1016
01:51:07,292 --> 01:51:11,338
You are the eventuality of an anomaly,
which despite my sincerest efforts...

1017
01:51:11,588 --> 01:51:14,383
...I've been unable to eliminate
from what is otherwise...

1018
01:51:14,591 --> 01:51:18,971
...a harmony of mathematical precision.

1019
01:51:19,388 --> 01:51:21,682
While it remains a burden
assiduously avoided...

1020
01:51:21,890 --> 01:51:26,270
...it is not unexpected and thus
not beyond a measure of control...

1021
01:51:26,478 --> 01:51:30,440
...which has led you, inexorably...

1022
01:51:31,358 --> 01:51:32,609
...here.

1023
01:51:32,860 --> 01:51:36,905
- You haven't answered my question.
- Quite right.

1024
01:51:37,114 --> 01:51:40,868
Interesting.
That was quicker than the others.

1025
01:51:41,076 --> 01:51:43,704
<i>Others? How many?</i>
<i>What others?</i>

1026
01:51:43,787 --> 01:51:46,290
The Matrix is older than you know.

1027
01:51:46,498 --> 01:51:50,460
I count from the emergence of one integral
anomaly to the emergence of the next.

1028
01:51:50,669 --> 01:51:52,963
In which case, this is the sixth version.

1029
01:51:53,046 --> 01:51:55,549
<i>Five before me?</i>
<i>He's lying. Bullshit.</i>

1030
01:51:55,674 --> 01:51:59,219
<i>There are only two possible explanations.</i>
<i>There were five before me.</i>

1031
01:51:59,428 --> 01:52:00,679
<i>Either no one told me...</i>

1032
01:52:01,930 --> 01:52:05,976
...or no one knows.
- Precisely.

1033
01:52:06,101 --> 01:52:09,438
As you are undoubtedly gathering,
the anomaly is systemic...

1034
01:52:09,646 --> 01:52:12,983
...creating fluctuations in even
the most simplistic equations.

1035
01:52:13,192 --> 01:52:16,403
<i>You can 't control me!</i>
<i>I'm gonna smash you to bits!</i>

1036
01:52:16,653 --> 01:52:18,405
<i>I'm gonna fucking kill you!</i>

1037
01:52:18,614 --> 01:52:21,742
<i>You can 't make me do anything.</i>
<i>You old, white prick!</i>

1038
01:52:24,036 --> 01:52:25,495
Choice.

1039
01:52:25,704 --> 01:52:27,581
The problem is choice.

1040
01:52:49,770 --> 01:52:53,440
The first Matrix I designed
was naturally perfect, a work of art.

1041
01:52:53,524 --> 01:52:55,442
Flawless, sublime.

1042
01:52:55,526 --> 01:52:59,071
A triumph equaled only
by its monumental failure.

1043
01:52:59,696 --> 01:53:02,199
The inevitability of its doom
is apparent now...

1044
01:53:02,282 --> 01:53:05,619
...as a consequence of the imperfection
inherent in every human.

1045
01:53:05,869 --> 01:53:08,789
Thus, I redesigned it
based on your history...

1046
01:53:08,956 --> 01:53:12,960
...to more accurately reflect
the varying grotesqueries of your nature.

1047
01:53:13,669 --> 01:53:17,422
However, I was again frustrated
by failure.

1048
01:53:18,882 --> 01:53:21,468
I have come to understand
that the answer eluded me...

1049
01:53:21,718 --> 01:53:23,679
...because it required a lesser mind.

1050
01:53:23,887 --> 01:53:29,810
Or perhaps, a mind less bound
by the parameters of perfection.

1051
01:53:30,227 --> 01:53:34,731
Thus, the answer was stumbled upon
by another, an intuitive program...

1052
01:53:34,815 --> 01:53:39,653
...initially created to investigate
certain aspects of the human psyche.

1053
01:53:39,820 --> 01:53:45,784
If I am the father of the Matrix,
she would undoubtedly be its mother.

1054
01:53:46,410 --> 01:53:48,704
- The Oracle.
- Please.

1055
01:53:49,413 --> 01:53:53,417
As I was saying, she stumbled upon a
solution whereby <i>99</i> percent of subjects...

1056
01:53:53,584 --> 01:53:56,420
...accepted the program, as long as they
were given a choice...

1057
01:53:56,628 --> 01:54:00,799
...even if they were only aware
of the choice at a near unconscious level.

1058
01:54:00,924 --> 01:54:04,344
While this answer functioned,
it was fundamentally flawed...

1059
01:54:04,553 --> 01:54:08,515
...thus creating the otherwise
contradictory systemic anomaly...

1060
01:54:08,724 --> 01:54:11,435
...that, if left unchecked,
might threaten the system.

1061
01:54:11,768 --> 01:54:15,939
Ergo, those that refused the program,
while a minority, if unchecked...

1062
01:54:16,023 --> 01:54:20,194
...would constitute
an escalating probability of disaster.

1063
01:54:20,277 --> 01:54:22,070
This is about Zion.

1064
01:54:22,613 --> 01:54:26,241
You are here because Zion
is about to be destroyed.

1065
01:54:26,450 --> 01:54:30,829
Its every living inhabitant terminated,
its entire existence eradicated.

1066
01:54:31,121 --> 01:54:32,206
Bullshit.

1067
01:54:32,289 --> 01:54:35,542
Denial is the most predictable
of all human responses.

1068
01:54:35,709 --> 01:54:42,216
But rest assured, this will be
the sixth time we have destroyed it...

1069
01:54:42,299 --> 01:54:46,386
...and we have become
exceedingly efficient at it.

1070
01:54:59,066 --> 01:55:00,317
The function of the One...

1071
01:55:00,567 --> 01:55:05,239
...is now to return to the source, allowing
a dissemination of the code you carry...

1072
01:55:05,322 --> 01:55:07,115
...reinserting the prime program.

1073
01:55:07,658 --> 01:55:11,703
After which you will be required to select
from the Matrix 23 individuals...

1074
01:55:11,828 --> 01:55:15,040
...sixteen female, seven male,
to rebuild Zion.

1075
01:55:15,249 --> 01:55:19,837
Failure to comply with this process
will result in a cataclysmic system crash...

1076
01:55:19,920 --> 01:55:22,339
...killing everyone connected
to the Matrix...

1077
01:55:22,422 --> 01:55:25,050
...which, coupled with the
extermination of Zion...

1078
01:55:25,259 --> 01:55:29,429
...will result in the extinction
of the entire human race.

1079
01:55:29,763 --> 01:55:33,809
You won't let it happen. You can't.
You need human beings to survive.

1080
01:55:34,643 --> 01:55:38,272
There are levels of survival
we are prepared to accept.

1081
01:55:38,397 --> 01:55:41,191
The relevant issue is
whether or not you are ready...

1082
01:55:41,441 --> 01:55:44,945
...to accept the responsibility for the death
of every human being in this world.

1083
01:55:51,451 --> 01:55:54,037
It is interesting reading your reactions.

1084
01:55:55,080 --> 01:55:58,834
Your five predecessors were, by design,
based on a similar predication...

1085
01:55:59,042 --> 01:56:03,547
...a contingent affirmation that was meant
to create a profound attachment...

1086
01:56:03,630 --> 01:56:07,301
...to the rest of your species,
facilitating the function of the One.

1087
01:56:07,384 --> 01:56:09,803
While the others experience this
in a general way...

1088
01:56:09,887 --> 01:56:12,890
...your experience is far more specific...

1089
01:56:13,223 --> 01:56:16,143
...vis-á-vis love.

1090
01:56:17,060 --> 01:56:18,729
Trinity!

1091
01:56:21,064 --> 01:56:25,319
Apropos, she entered the Matrix
to save your life at the cost of her own.

1092
01:56:25,736 --> 01:56:26,778
No.

1093
01:56:27,487 --> 01:56:31,575
Which brings us at last to the moment
of truth, wherein the fundamental flaw...

1094
01:56:31,783 --> 01:56:34,912
...is ultimately expressed
and the anomaly revealed...

1095
01:56:34,995 --> 01:56:39,082
...as both beginning and end.

1096
01:56:39,166 --> 01:56:40,834
There are two doors.

1097
01:56:41,084 --> 01:56:44,296
The door to your right leads to the source
and the salvation of Zion.

1098
01:56:44,838 --> 01:56:51,178
The door to your left leads back to the
Matrix, to her and the end of your species.

1099
01:56:51,261 --> 01:56:55,682
As you adequately put,
the problem is choice.

1100
01:56:55,849 --> 01:56:59,311
But we already know what
you are going to do, don't we?

1101
01:56:59,520 --> 01:57:03,607
Already I can see the chain reaction,
the chemical precursors that signal...

1102
01:57:03,774 --> 01:57:09,029
...the onset of an emotion designed
specifically to overwhelm logic and reason.

1103
01:57:09,196 --> 01:57:13,784
An emotion that is already blinding you
from the simple and obvious truth:

1104
01:57:14,034 --> 01:57:20,457
She is going to die and there is nothing
you can do to stop it.

1105
01:57:25,462 --> 01:57:29,633
Hope. It is the quintessential
human delusion, simultaneously...

1106
01:57:29,758 --> 01:57:33,512
...the source of your greatest strength
and your greatest weakness.

1107
01:57:33,720 --> 01:57:37,975
If I were you, I would hope
that we don't meet again.

1108
01:57:38,225 --> 01:57:39,560
We won't.

1109
01:57:47,067 --> 01:57:49,236
We got a serious situation, sir.

1110
01:57:49,653 --> 01:57:50,821
Oh, no.

1111
01:58:50,464 --> 01:58:54,009
- What was that?
- It's moving faster than anything I've seen.

1112
01:59:44,601 --> 01:59:46,353
Holy shit, he caught her.

1113
02:00:00,325 --> 02:00:02,202
Neo, I had to.

1114
02:00:02,286 --> 02:00:04,079
I know.

1115
02:00:09,084 --> 02:00:11,712
The bullet is still inside.

1116
02:00:22,431 --> 02:00:24,308
Trinity...

1117
02:00:25,559 --> 02:00:27,227
...don't you quit on me now.

1118
02:00:36,403 --> 02:00:38,989
I'm sorry.

1119
02:00:45,579 --> 02:00:47,873
Trinity.

1120
02:00:57,758 --> 02:00:59,760
Trinity...

1121
02:00:59,968 --> 02:01:01,762
...I know you can hear me.

1122
02:01:02,471 --> 02:01:05,098
I'm not letting go.

1123
02:01:05,182 --> 02:01:06,850
I can't.

1124
02:01:08,101 --> 02:01:10,270
I love you too damn much.

1125
02:01:38,966 --> 02:01:40,217
I can't take this.

1126
02:01:43,971 --> 02:01:47,099
I guess this makes us even.

1127
02:01:59,820 --> 02:02:01,697
I don't understand it.

1128
02:02:01,905 --> 02:02:04,908
Everything was done
as it was supposed to be done.

1129
02:02:05,033 --> 02:02:08,161
Once the One reaches the source,
the war should be over.

1130
02:02:08,245 --> 02:02:11,081
- In 24 hours, it will be.
- What?

1131
02:02:11,290 --> 02:02:15,669
If we don't do something in 24 hours,
Zion will be destroyed.

1132
02:02:16,086 --> 02:02:17,671
- What?
- How do you know that?

1133
02:02:18,172 --> 02:02:20,174
- I was told it would happen.
- By whom?

1134
02:02:21,175 --> 02:02:24,011
It doesn't matter. I believed him.

1135
02:02:24,219 --> 02:02:27,973
- That's impossible. The prophecy tells us...
- It was a lie, Morpheus.

1136
02:02:29,766 --> 02:02:32,352
The prophecy was a lie.

1137
02:02:33,520 --> 02:02:36,523
The One was never meant
to end anything.

1138
02:02:36,732 --> 02:02:39,776
It was all another system of control.

1139
02:02:39,860 --> 02:02:42,988
I don't believe that.

1140
02:02:43,280 --> 02:02:45,699
But you said it yourself.

1141
02:02:45,782 --> 02:02:49,870
How can the prophecy be true
if the war isn't over?

1142
02:02:56,043 --> 02:02:58,420
I'm sorry.

1143
02:02:58,629 --> 02:03:01,965
I know it isn't easy to hear, but...

1144
02:03:02,174 --> 02:03:05,302
...I swear to you it's the truth.

1145
02:03:08,555 --> 02:03:11,225
- What are we gonna do?
- I don't know.

1146
02:03:13,435 --> 02:03:14,686
Oh, no!

1147
02:03:24,071 --> 02:03:27,407
- What are they doing?
- They're just out of EMP range.

1148
02:03:27,824 --> 02:03:29,076
It's a bomb.

1149
02:03:30,327 --> 02:03:32,496
We have to get out of here. Now.

1150
02:04:09,199 --> 02:04:11,118
I have dreamed a dream...

1151
02:04:14,121 --> 02:04:17,457
...but now that dream
has gone from me.

1152
02:04:28,510 --> 02:04:30,804
Here they come.

1153
02:04:31,013 --> 02:04:32,806
Let's go, Morpheus.

1154
02:04:34,141 --> 02:04:37,269
- We won't make it.
- We have to try.

1155
02:04:44,985 --> 02:04:47,905
- Come on!
- Something's different.

1156
02:04:48,113 --> 02:04:50,073
What?

1157
02:04:50,824 --> 02:04:52,284
I can feel them.

1158
02:05:15,224 --> 02:05:16,767
Neo!

1159
02:05:22,940 --> 02:05:26,610
- What happened?
- I don't know.

1160
02:05:31,782 --> 02:05:33,784
It's the <i>Hammer</i>.

1161
02:05:45,462 --> 02:05:48,173
He's in some kind of coma...

1162
02:05:48,298 --> 02:05:50,551
...but his vitals are stable.

1163
02:05:51,718 --> 02:05:53,720
What about you?

1164
02:05:53,804 --> 02:05:55,973
I'm fine.

1165
02:05:56,098 --> 02:05:58,475
You could use some rest.

1166
02:05:58,725 --> 02:06:00,477
No, I'm gonna stay with him.

1167
02:06:07,568 --> 02:06:10,279
Lock was right.
He guessed that the machines...

1168
02:06:10,404 --> 02:06:13,323
...would cut off the mainlines
in and out of Zion.

1169
02:06:13,407 --> 02:06:16,243
He thought a counterattack
might surprise them.

1170
02:06:16,410 --> 02:06:19,872
It sounded good.
I figured we had a shot...

1171
02:06:20,163 --> 02:06:22,791
...until someone screwed it up.

1172
02:06:22,916 --> 02:06:25,502
An EMP was triggered before
we got in position.

1173
02:06:25,711 --> 02:06:29,590
- Five ships were instantly downed.
- When the machines broke through...

1174
02:06:29,673 --> 02:06:32,926
...it wasn't a battle, it was a slaughter.

1175
02:06:33,093 --> 02:06:35,929
Was it an accident?
Some sort of malfunction?

1176
02:06:36,138 --> 02:06:38,515
- No one knows.
- Someone does.

1177
02:06:38,765 --> 02:06:40,517
Who?

1178
02:06:40,601 --> 02:06:44,354
Once the machines were done with us,
they started digging again.

1179
02:06:44,479 --> 02:06:46,773
We made a quick pass
to look for survivors.

1180
02:06:46,982 --> 02:06:48,108
You found one?

1181
02:06:49,902 --> 02:06:51,570
Only one.
