1
00:01:49,731 --> 00:01:55,696
- Hey, what we gonna do now? Push it or what?
- You pull, I'll push it.

2
00:01:57,448 --> 00:01:59,616
Come on, now, man.

3
00:02:09,877 --> 00:02:12,129
Hey, watch your back.

4
00:02:12,254 --> 00:02:15,674
- You watch your back.
- Yeah, baby.

5
00:02:22,973 --> 00:02:26,810
- Check it out.
- All right.

6
00:02:26,977 --> 00:02:29,271
Clear.

7
00:02:35,027 --> 00:02:37,154
This is not the right shoe.

8
00:02:57,424 --> 00:03:00,886
- Hi, Chelsea.
- Hi, Paul.

9
00:03:04,306 --> 00:03:05,682
Thank you.

10
00:03:05,807 --> 00:03:12,231
I'm so happy to see you all and to welcome you
to my tenth annual spring line collection.

11
00:03:12,356 --> 00:03:17,945
I'm proud to announce that 50 per cent
of the proceeds from tonight's show

12
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:23,158
will go to the New York
Save the Children's Foundation.

13
00:03:23,283 --> 00:03:28,413
Now, fasten your seat belts
and on with the show.

14
00:03:50,894 --> 00:03:52,980
Mr. O'Shea. Hey!

15
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:58,652
Chicki.

16
00:03:59,611 --> 00:04:01,613
Come here. Say "shit".

17
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:04,282
- Shit.
- There you go.

18
00:04:04,408 --> 00:04:09,246
- Sal, take Chicki down to the factory.
- Tommy.

19
00:04:09,371 --> 00:04:14,209
- Don't let Big Al leave till I see him.
- Whatever you say. Let's go, Chicki.

20
00:04:15,711 --> 00:04:18,505
<i>- Hey, stronz'. Come on, let's go.
- What?</i>

21
00:04:24,928 --> 00:04:29,141
- I love it, but you should be ready.
- There she is.

22
00:04:29,266 --> 00:04:32,644
Tommy, you shouldn't be here.
It's bad for my company.

23
00:04:32,769 --> 00:04:36,440
Maxine. Wait for me in the limo.

24
00:04:38,066 --> 00:04:41,695
Max! You. Wait. Limo.

25
00:04:47,284 --> 00:04:51,621
"Your" company. That's "our" problem.

26
00:05:04,885 --> 00:05:08,722
These numbers are very bad, Albert.
You're way behind.

27
00:05:08,889 --> 00:05:11,349
- What can I do?
- Pray.

28
00:05:11,475 --> 00:05:17,647
How many times do I have to tell you about that?
Jesus! I'll tell you what you do.

29
00:05:17,772 --> 00:05:23,028
Tell Tommy you made a mistake, you can fix it.
I hate to see you get hurt.

30
00:05:23,195 --> 00:05:27,574
You're already fat, ugly and stupid.
You don't need any more problems.

31
00:05:27,699 --> 00:05:30,827
Am I right? Am I fucking right?

32
00:05:30,952 --> 00:05:34,122
What are you, fucking deaf? Am I right?

33
00:05:34,247 --> 00:05:36,208
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

34
00:05:36,374 --> 00:05:38,460
Thank you.

35
00:05:39,544 --> 00:05:42,005
I don't need this fucking shit.

36
00:06:04,986 --> 00:06:08,490
- I see Chelsea's here.
- This is not the time.

37
00:06:09,241 --> 00:06:12,869
That's my daughter, sitting with a geek.

38
00:06:13,036 --> 00:06:17,666
She's not your daughter any more.
A judge took her away from you, remember?

39
00:06:17,791 --> 00:06:19,876
I never forget...

40
00:06:21,503 --> 00:06:23,129
...love.

41
00:06:34,182 --> 00:06:39,145
What's the matter with you?
Do you believe this guy? This is pathetic.

42
00:06:41,898 --> 00:06:46,653
Albert. Big, fat Albert. How're you doing, Al?

43
00:06:46,778 --> 00:06:51,241
- Mr. O'Shea, there's no need...
- What do you mean? I always have need.

44
00:06:51,366 --> 00:06:55,328
- Say something, stutter.
- I can't play with the numbers any more.

45
00:06:55,453 --> 00:06:58,790
- We're gonna have a problem.
- I see, you don't understand.

46
00:06:58,957 --> 00:07:02,293
Clean that goddamn wax out of your ears.

47
00:07:02,419 --> 00:07:08,633
- We have to make the dirty cash clean, OK?
- But we're moving more cash than clothes.

48
00:07:08,758 --> 00:07:10,885
Really?

49
00:07:26,359 --> 00:07:29,821
- Congratulations.
- Hello, darling. Where's Chelsea?

50
00:07:29,946 --> 00:07:33,283
Glued to her seat.
She's going to take after you.

51
00:07:33,408 --> 00:07:37,871
- You're going to miss the best part.
- The best part is here.

52
00:07:39,873 --> 00:07:42,584
What's the matter?

53
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:47,338
- How did this happen?
- Chelsea's father's here.

54
00:07:47,464 --> 00:07:51,843
- He did this to you?
- It's a way of life for him.

55
00:07:53,052 --> 00:07:55,138
Where is he?

56
00:07:55,889 --> 00:07:59,517
- Olivia, where is he?
- He's downstairs in the factory.

57
00:07:59,642 --> 00:08:01,269
Come on.

58
00:08:08,276 --> 00:08:11,196
- Come on, move your ass, Albert.
- Mr. O'Shea...

59
00:08:11,321 --> 00:08:16,826
There she is,
the enchanting Esther Williams.

60
00:08:17,744 --> 00:08:20,830
Show us your best stroke, Esther!

61
00:08:20,955 --> 00:08:23,416
- How much, ballpark?
- Mr. O'Shea, please.

62
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:25,835
- No, give me a number.
- Come on.

63
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,379
That was 1,500 dollars' worth of merchandise.

64
00:08:28,546 --> 00:08:33,343
1,500? Chicki, grab a handful
of high fashion there.

65
00:08:36,429 --> 00:08:38,890
Eveningwear. You're the greatest, Tommy.

66
00:08:39,015 --> 00:08:41,601
And you're stupid.

67
00:08:42,977 --> 00:08:46,189
More clothes than cash.
Solve your problem?

68
00:08:46,314 --> 00:08:50,485
With all due respect, Mr. O'Shea,
I follow Miss Regent's instructions.

69
00:08:52,695 --> 00:08:54,197
Oh!

70
00:08:58,117 --> 00:08:59,369
Reg!

71
00:09:16,511 --> 00:09:23,226
You and me are gonna take a little walk
around the woodshed.

72
00:09:23,434 --> 00:09:25,561
Mr. O'Shea, please.

73
00:09:25,687 --> 00:09:29,357
- Mr. O'Shea, Mr. O'Shea.
- That's my name.

74
00:09:29,524 --> 00:09:31,776
- Mr. O'Shea...
- You're repeating yourself.

75
00:09:31,901 --> 00:09:34,988
- Is this necessary?
- You're boring the shit out of me.

76
00:09:35,113 --> 00:09:37,907
You know what your problem is?

77
00:09:38,032 --> 00:09:39,409
What?

78
00:09:39,534 --> 00:09:44,497
You and your boss think you don't have to
service your partners any more.

79
00:09:44,622 --> 00:09:50,128
I'm partnered up with over 35 companies,
all of whom are very responsive and helpful,

80
00:09:50,253 --> 00:09:53,715
with the exception of this company
because it's too fat.

81
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:56,426
And you, you're too fat.

82
00:09:58,678 --> 00:10:01,806
Look at you. You look like a beached whale.

83
00:10:01,931 --> 00:10:06,144
- Mr. O'Shea.
- Albert. I warned you. You wouldn't listen.

84
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:10,523
- Whoa!
- Look what we have here.

85
00:10:15,695 --> 00:10:19,907
I'm just acting, Albert. Relax.

86
00:10:20,033 --> 00:10:22,577
But in all seriousness...

87
00:10:22,702 --> 00:10:25,997
- My god!
- That's gross.

88
00:10:26,122 --> 00:10:32,462
Big tub of guts. I think you ought to have
Dr. O'Shea's one-second weight loss.

89
00:10:34,338 --> 00:10:39,218
- Don't move, fat man.
- I think Al's got the message, don't you?

90
00:10:43,139 --> 00:10:44,515
Tommy.

91
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:51,272
- This is bullshit! And so are you.
- My head nigger and you talk to me like that?

92
00:10:51,397 --> 00:10:53,858
- Fuck you, son of a bitch!
- Hey!

93
00:10:53,983 --> 00:10:57,862
Reg, that was really stupid.

94
00:10:57,987 --> 00:11:01,908
- You got a big mouth. Now apologize.
- I ain't saying shit.

95
00:11:02,033 --> 00:11:08,623
Now, Reggie, you know if you don't say shit,
you'll lose 90 per cent of your vocabulary.

96
00:11:09,582 --> 00:11:12,627
You people just never learn, do you?

97
00:11:14,045 --> 00:11:16,714
There you go, Sambo.

98
00:11:16,839 --> 00:11:19,926
Take the wounded bear and dance outta here.

99
00:11:22,303 --> 00:11:29,143
- I ain't taking this shit any more.
- Reg, take your problem up with the NWACP.

100
00:11:30,269 --> 00:11:34,440
- I think he's gonna cause trouble, Tommy.
- Trouble breeds trouble.

101
00:11:36,859 --> 00:11:40,404
- What is this?
- Paul. Tommy.

102
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:43,783
- Is this him?
- You got a problem?

103
00:11:46,619 --> 00:11:51,123
- Do guns make you nervous?
- Guns have their uses.

104
00:11:51,249 --> 00:11:54,168
Idiots with guns make me nervous.

105
00:11:58,714 --> 00:12:04,887
Put it away. Well, there she is.
How's my little girl?

106
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,810
Accident.

107
00:12:10,935 --> 00:12:16,774
3,000 dollar suit.
Can't take me... anywhere.

108
00:12:24,407 --> 00:12:27,326
- It's gonna be one of those days.
- What?

109
00:12:27,451 --> 00:12:30,997
I was just saying to Chicki it's a nice day.

110
00:12:37,378 --> 00:12:43,342
- Think about it, Reg. Tommy'll kill you.
- Screw Tommy, man.

111
00:12:44,051 --> 00:12:45,970
Tommy won't like it.

112
00:12:47,096 --> 00:12:49,598
I couldn't keep him out, Paul.

113
00:12:49,724 --> 00:12:52,977
He saw an opportunity and he just pounced.

114
00:12:53,102 --> 00:12:57,982
The unions, trucking,
he's infiltrated every aspect of my business...

115
00:12:58,107 --> 00:13:01,652
- Mommy! Come over here!
... and almost all the garment district.

116
00:13:01,777 --> 00:13:04,947
I could tell you a lot more.

117
00:13:05,072 --> 00:13:09,160
- You've told me enough. The DA's a friend.
- Look.

118
00:13:09,285 --> 00:13:13,497
Oh!

119
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:40,149
- Paul. Nice to see you again.
- Brian. Nice to see you. Come in.

120
00:13:40,274 --> 00:13:43,444
This is my assistant, Hector Vasquez.
Hector, meet Paul Kersey.

121
00:13:43,569 --> 00:13:45,237
Nice to meet you.

122
00:13:45,362 --> 00:13:50,451
- Stewart. Professor Paul Stewart.
- Right.

123
00:13:50,576 --> 00:13:53,662
I should have remembered.
I gave you that name.

124
00:13:53,788 --> 00:13:56,040
No, it wasn't you.

125
00:13:57,291 --> 00:14:02,630
It was your boss when you were working
with the witness protection programme.

126
00:14:02,755 --> 00:14:07,384
- The new life we gave you working out?
- Yeah. Still teaching architecture.

127
00:14:07,551 --> 00:14:10,387
- So life's good?
- Depends.

128
00:14:10,513 --> 00:14:12,848
- On what?
- On you.

129
00:14:12,973 --> 00:14:17,186
Ah, yes. You said on the phone
that a friend needs my help?

130
00:14:17,311 --> 00:14:21,440
- Olivia Regent.
- The fashion designer?

131
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:25,528
- Wasn't she married to?
- Tommy O'Shea.

132
00:14:25,653 --> 00:14:30,324
You see, O'Shea has involved himself
in her business,

133
00:14:30,449 --> 00:14:35,204
in the whole fashion world, in fact,
in a very bad way.

134
00:14:35,329 --> 00:14:39,625
- She would like to get him out.
- Maybe we can help each other.

135
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:44,171
I haven't been able to touch that guy.
When can she come in?

136
00:14:44,255 --> 00:14:48,092
- Tomorrow?
- Perfect. Tommy O'Shea.

137
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:53,889
- I hope she realizes her whole life will change.
- She hopes it's for the better.

138
00:15:45,858 --> 00:15:48,736
Oh!

139
00:15:48,861 --> 00:15:50,946
I bet it's beautiful.

140
00:15:52,114 --> 00:15:54,199
Oh! It is.

141
00:15:55,826 --> 00:16:02,875
Paul, I can't tell you what this means to me.
And Chelsea, she so needs a father.

142
00:16:04,001 --> 00:16:08,714
- Can I take that to mean a yes?
- Come here.

143
00:16:11,091 --> 00:16:13,302
With all my heart.

144
00:16:22,978 --> 00:16:24,271
To us.

145
00:16:37,326 --> 00:16:39,661
Oh! Oh!

146
00:16:40,454 --> 00:16:42,915
I'll be right back.

147
00:17:23,914 --> 00:17:28,043
I've always been a fan of yours,
Miss Regent.

148
00:17:30,671 --> 00:17:34,967
- Are you embarrassed or something?
- I'm not embarrassed.

149
00:17:35,092 --> 00:17:37,761
Ah, jeez! Come on, what happened here?

150
00:17:39,263 --> 00:17:42,558
- OK, sweetheart, don't worry about it.
- Are you OK?

151
00:17:42,683 --> 00:17:46,770
- Bring some more of these, will you?
- Get him a towel.

152
00:17:51,859 --> 00:17:54,528
There, that's better.

153
00:17:55,612 --> 00:17:57,948
Goddamn dandruff!

154
00:17:58,073 --> 00:18:00,826
Oh! I'm sorry.

155
00:18:02,578 --> 00:18:07,708
It's true, isn't it? Look at that.
What a face you've got. Look at it.

156
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:13,380
Not me, you. Look at that beautiful face!

157
00:18:13,505 --> 00:18:18,760
Take a good look at it because
I'm going to have to take it away from you.

158
00:18:20,721 --> 00:18:23,223
See, why do you?

159
00:18:23,348 --> 00:18:26,935
It's best to be careful who you talk to.

160
00:18:27,102 --> 00:18:32,691
We have ears everywhere.
We know what you're thinking of doing.

161
00:18:33,609 --> 00:18:38,280
Don't do it. It's a bad idea.

162
00:18:38,447 --> 00:18:40,532
So bad.

163
00:18:40,657 --> 00:18:42,659
So bad!

164
00:18:52,961 --> 00:18:55,088
Come here, baby.

165
00:19:05,932 --> 00:19:10,854
The next time,
your daughter won't have a mother.

166
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:30,665
Remember.

167
00:20:16,211 --> 00:20:17,754
Excuse me.

168
00:20:38,525 --> 00:20:41,486
She's stable, fair.

169
00:20:41,653 --> 00:20:46,241
- Tough gal.
- On the outside.

170
00:20:46,366 --> 00:20:53,665
I'm not gonna pull any punches. Even with
reconstruction, the face will never be the same.

171
00:20:58,461 --> 00:21:02,090
Why was O'Shea at the restaurant?
It's more than coincidence.

172
00:21:02,215 --> 00:21:05,343
How did he know she was going to testify?

173
00:21:05,468 --> 00:21:10,015
Paul, I didn't know she would need protection
until after she came in.

174
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:12,726
I should have known.

175
00:21:12,851 --> 00:21:16,354
I underestimated O'Shea.
It's not gonna happen again.

176
00:21:16,479 --> 00:21:20,609
It's not your fault.
She'll still talk to us, won't she?

177
00:21:20,734 --> 00:21:23,904
- I don't know.
- Paul...

178
00:21:24,029 --> 00:21:26,948
This thing is not just gonna go away.

179
00:21:28,617 --> 00:21:32,162
Let me just have a couple of words,
all right?

180
00:21:33,455 --> 00:21:35,624
Hoyle. Vasquez.

181
00:21:35,749 --> 00:21:40,337
My investigation started an hour ago
and the chief prosecutor's already here?

182
00:21:40,462 --> 00:21:45,425
Olivia Regent, the victim, is part of an ongoing
investigation in my department, Lieutenant.

183
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:48,720
- The Tommy O'Shea investigation?
- What do you know about that?

184
00:21:48,887 --> 00:21:53,183
He was at the scene of the crime
and wherever he is, he stinks.

185
00:21:53,308 --> 00:21:59,898
I watched him come up through the Irish gangs.
Now he's going big time. He's a scumbag.

186
00:22:00,065 --> 00:22:06,112
But we believe the perp might have been
somebody else. Do you recognize him?

187
00:22:06,237 --> 00:22:09,532
He had a lot of make-up on. I don't know.

188
00:22:09,658 --> 00:22:14,329
- May I, sir?
- Do you know him, Vasquez?

189
00:22:14,454 --> 00:22:17,540
- Looks like Frederick Garretty.
- Aka Freddie Flakes.

190
00:22:17,666 --> 00:22:20,960
He's got a skin condition. It causes bad dandruff.

191
00:22:21,086 --> 00:22:25,590
When O'Shea has a special job to do,
he uses this piece of scum.

192
00:22:25,715 --> 00:22:29,928
Likes disguises, a security freak.
A very lethal guy.

193
00:22:30,053 --> 00:22:33,890
What about Tommy O'Shea? He's the guilty one.

194
00:22:34,015 --> 00:22:38,520
Paul, unless I have something more to go on,
my hands are tied.

195
00:22:38,645 --> 00:22:41,898
O'Shea has an ironclad alibi, right?

196
00:22:42,023 --> 00:22:44,692
You were there.

197
00:22:44,859 --> 00:22:48,405
I see I'm wasting my time with you guys.

198
00:22:49,697 --> 00:22:53,618
I got some more questions. I'll be calling you.

199
00:22:53,743 --> 00:22:56,413
Still not sure what you're doing here.

200
00:22:56,538 --> 00:22:59,874
Well, it's a little over your head, Lieutenant.

201
00:22:59,999 --> 00:23:03,878
Why don't you just do your job, I'll do mine. OK?

202
00:23:04,671 --> 00:23:07,173
Excuse me.

203
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:09,300
Lieutenant.

204
00:23:09,426 --> 00:23:15,515
I remember when he was fixing parking tickets
in the DA's office. Let's get outta here.

205
00:23:32,407 --> 00:23:36,286
- How's Chelsea?
- Don't worry, Professor. She sleeps upstairs.

206
00:24:08,359 --> 00:24:11,279
- How'd this happen?
- Chelsea's father's here.

207
00:24:11,404 --> 00:24:15,825
- He did this to you?
- It's a way of life for him.

208
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:19,537
- I could tell you a lot more.
- You've told me enough.

209
00:24:19,662 --> 00:24:23,583
I couldn't keep him out.
He saw an opportunity and he pounced.

210
00:24:23,708 --> 00:24:28,838
The unions, trucking,
he has infiltrated every aspect of my business

211
00:24:28,963 --> 00:24:31,758
and most everyone else in the garment district.

212
00:24:31,883 --> 00:24:36,095
Tommy O'Shea.
I hope she realizes her whole life will change.

213
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:40,183
- She hopes it's for the better.
- I'm not pulling any punches.

214
00:24:40,308 --> 00:24:44,896
Even with reconstruction,
the face will never be the same.

215
00:24:45,063 --> 00:24:47,148
You got a problem?

216
00:24:47,273 --> 00:24:51,486
- Guns make you nervous?
- Guns have their uses.

217
00:24:51,611 --> 00:24:54,489
Idiots with guns make me nervous.

218
00:25:18,554 --> 00:25:22,183
Little Reggie's been telling tales
and talking out of school.

219
00:25:22,308 --> 00:25:24,435
Now who's Reggie been talking to?

220
00:25:24,602 --> 00:25:30,400
- I said nothing to nobody, you white trash.
- I had no idea you were so prejudiced.

221
00:25:33,736 --> 00:25:38,616
I usually get a shine with that.
Do what you want with him.

222
00:25:38,741 --> 00:25:42,495
- There you go saying stupid things again.
- Hey, Sal.

223
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:48,459
You're looking a little rumpled.
What do you say we straighten you out?

224
00:25:48,584 --> 00:25:51,713
- It's not a good thing.
- It'll improve your appearance.

225
00:25:51,838 --> 00:25:54,340
No! No!

226
00:25:54,465 --> 00:25:56,801
Aagh!

227
00:25:58,386 --> 00:26:04,058
Reg, we know you've been talking to somebody.
Why don't you just tell us who?

228
00:26:04,183 --> 00:26:09,188
- I ain't said nothing to nobody.
- He ain't said nothing to nobody.

229
00:26:14,402 --> 00:26:18,489
- I bet that smarts, eh? Reg? Reg?
- What?

230
00:26:18,656 --> 00:26:21,993
- Why did you do it? Don't lie!
- I said nothing.

231
00:26:22,118 --> 00:26:25,538
You're lying! Let's straighten his hair. Come on.

232
00:26:25,705 --> 00:26:29,876
Let's straighten his hair. Yeah, that's better.

233
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:36,048
Well, Reg, now you're all straightened out.
Say goodnight.

234
00:26:39,051 --> 00:26:42,221
Chicki, we'll meet you and Reg down in the car.

235
00:26:42,346 --> 00:26:45,349
Get up. Get up.

236
00:26:53,816 --> 00:26:56,194
Goodnight, Reg.

237
00:27:00,448 --> 00:27:04,076
- OK, is that it?
- Yeah, here it is.

238
00:27:04,202 --> 00:27:06,412
Looks like a pen, doesn't it?

239
00:27:06,579 --> 00:27:11,375
When we get this new recorded evidence,
we're gonna nail O'Shea.

240
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:15,338
- Albert, be very careful.
- Don't worry.

241
00:27:15,463 --> 00:27:19,300
- We are gonna get those bastards, right?
- You're damn right.

242
00:27:19,425 --> 00:27:22,803
You know how to use this?

243
00:27:22,929 --> 00:27:25,765
We make a hole in your shirt there...

244
00:28:05,805 --> 00:28:08,641
Clear, let's go.

245
00:28:16,565 --> 00:28:20,277
- This goombah won't pay for protection.
- Let's have some fun.

246
00:28:29,078 --> 00:28:32,248
- Get out! Get out of here!
- Cash!

247
00:28:39,922 --> 00:28:42,133
There you go!

248
00:28:44,051 --> 00:28:49,014
Next time Tommy says pay,
you pay or we play.

249
00:29:07,616 --> 00:29:11,537
What about the laundry shipment
coming this afternoon?

250
00:29:11,662 --> 00:29:16,584
Laundry? Oh, you mean the clothes
for the homeless shelter?

251
00:29:17,585 --> 00:29:21,297
- What?
- You know, people without homes.

252
00:29:21,422 --> 00:29:25,593
You forgot? You don't care about people
less fortunate than you? Disgusting.

253
00:29:25,718 --> 00:29:31,056
I'm gonna strike you from my Christmas list.
Mind if I borrow your pen?

254
00:29:41,025 --> 00:29:43,402
Thanks, Albert.

255
00:29:43,527 --> 00:29:46,113
Goodbye, Albert.

256
00:29:50,034 --> 00:29:51,494
They made him.

257
00:30:12,681 --> 00:30:14,350
Bitch!

258
00:30:36,205 --> 00:30:38,415
Police! Out of my way!

259
00:30:56,392 --> 00:30:59,061
Stop! Police!

260
00:31:29,466 --> 00:31:33,220
- Going down to the morgue.
- Massive internal injuries.

261
00:31:33,345 --> 00:31:35,806
Sorry, guys, that's all we could do.

262
00:31:50,654 --> 00:31:54,033
- Well, how is she?
- She's gone.

263
00:31:57,244 --> 00:32:01,540
Why were you there, anyway?
You're not going back to your old ways?

264
00:32:01,665 --> 00:32:06,378
- Is that such a bad idea?
- Let the cops take these guys down.

265
00:32:06,503 --> 00:32:10,883
- You know, sometimes the law works.
- And sometimes it doesn't.

266
00:32:11,049 --> 00:32:15,512
These people steal, murder,
destroy people's lives, and get away with it.

267
00:32:15,637 --> 00:32:21,059
They have alibis, money, lawyers, power.
They have everything.

268
00:32:22,853 --> 00:32:27,900
Tell me something. How long
have you been trying to take these guys down?

269
00:32:28,025 --> 00:32:35,157
16 years. These guys are pros. It's not like
it's some gang of doped-out muggers.

270
00:32:35,282 --> 00:32:37,242
16 years?

271
00:32:40,412 --> 00:32:43,081
It's a long time to be failing.

272
00:33:07,856 --> 00:33:10,275
<i>- I gotta go. Bye.
- Ciao.</i>

273
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,861
Mama, relax. It's a sidewalk.

274
00:33:14,613 --> 00:33:17,115
Mama, who's the best, uh?

275
00:34:26,935 --> 00:34:30,522
Paul, I don't want Chelsea
to see me like this.

276
00:34:30,647 --> 00:34:33,400
Chelsea's still at my place.

277
00:34:33,608 --> 00:34:39,156
- I thought it best until things settle down.
- Thank you.

278
00:34:53,045 --> 00:34:56,131
Look at my face, Paul.

279
00:34:57,174 --> 00:35:02,888
Look at my face. I can't let Tommy
get away with this. I won't let him.

280
00:35:04,389 --> 00:35:09,311
Olivia, you don't know how hard
it is for me to say this.

281
00:35:09,436 --> 00:35:12,522
Let the law deal with Tommy.

282
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:17,652
OK. Whatever you say.

283
00:35:17,778 --> 00:35:21,156
First I have to make a telephone call.

284
00:35:21,907 --> 00:35:27,704
I think Hoyle's phone has been bugged.
So go along with me on this, will you?

285
00:35:30,165 --> 00:35:33,418
- District Attorney Hoyle's office.
- Attorney Hoyle, please.

286
00:35:33,627 --> 00:35:35,837
- Who's calling?
- Paul Stewart.

287
00:35:35,962 --> 00:35:37,798
- Hoyle.
- It's Paul.

288
00:35:37,923 --> 00:35:40,217
How's Olivia? She hasn't changed...

289
00:35:40,342 --> 00:35:43,970
Olivia has decided not to testify.

290
00:35:44,095 --> 00:35:48,934
- Paul.
- Can I talk to you about this for a minute?

291
00:35:49,059 --> 00:35:53,104
She's made up her mind
and I support her decision. I'm sorry.

292
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:55,482
All right. All right.

293
00:35:56,525 --> 00:35:57,651
Shit.

294
00:36:07,494 --> 00:36:09,579
Somebody else was listening.

295
00:36:17,003 --> 00:36:20,757
Hey! Tommy's really pissed, Gail.

296
00:36:26,388 --> 00:36:30,183
- It's payday, Gail. Where is it?
- I don't have any money.

297
00:36:30,308 --> 00:36:32,686
- Where is it?
- In the car.

298
00:36:32,811 --> 00:36:37,148
Come on, let's see what we got.
Is the money in here?

299
00:36:37,274 --> 00:36:40,735
Oh, look at this! Look at this! What's this?

300
00:36:45,282 --> 00:36:47,993
Get outta my way!

301
00:36:49,327 --> 00:36:53,748
- I'm outta here.
- You're losing weight. Stay for dinner.

302
00:36:53,873 --> 00:36:57,335
- Hector, you're staying for dinner.
- You are.

303
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:59,462
- Can I see your gun?
- No.

304
00:36:59,588 --> 00:37:02,549
What's the matter with you?
He's staying for dinner,

305
00:37:02,674 --> 00:37:06,303
first 'cause it's free
and second, look how lonely he is.

306
00:37:06,428 --> 00:37:08,138
And I'm hungry.

307
00:37:08,346 --> 00:37:13,601
OK, I'll stay. Wait.
You're not trying to set me up like last time?

308
00:37:13,727 --> 00:37:17,063
- Would I do that?
- Yes, you would, actually.

309
00:37:18,481 --> 00:37:22,652
- Did you?
- No, really. I have no idea who it is.

310
00:37:22,777 --> 00:37:26,531
- I have nothing to do with it.
- Is it Marilyn?

311
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:32,037
- She's got a moustache like you.
- Hector, I do have a friend, a great girl.

312
00:37:32,162 --> 00:37:36,708
She just came in from out of town.
I'd like you to meet her.

313
00:37:40,295 --> 00:37:43,006
Paul! Come on in.

314
00:37:46,176 --> 00:37:50,388
- What are you doing here?
- I came to tell you Olivia will testify.

315
00:37:50,513 --> 00:37:52,891
Why didn't you say on the phone?

316
00:37:53,058 --> 00:37:56,936
I think somebody’s listening in
to your conversations.

317
00:37:57,062 --> 00:37:59,105
Jesus Christ.

318
00:37:59,272 --> 00:38:03,151
OK. I understand.
I'm not making the same mistake twice.

319
00:38:03,318 --> 00:38:06,279
I'll send Agent McDonald
to her place for security.

320
00:38:06,446 --> 00:38:10,742
- OK? Come on in.
- No, I've gotta get back to Olivia.

321
00:38:10,867 --> 00:38:13,328
She's doing the right thing, Paul.

322
00:38:17,707 --> 00:38:20,126
Hector, she is gonna testify.

323
00:38:20,251 --> 00:38:24,005
Tell McDonald to get over to her place now.

324
00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:26,216
Sorry, I gotta make some calls.

325
00:38:42,482 --> 00:38:44,943
Tell me, Paul. What do you see?

326
00:38:45,109 --> 00:38:48,446
I see the woman I'm going to marry.

327
00:38:49,864 --> 00:38:53,243
Promise me if anything should happen to me...

328
00:38:53,368 --> 00:38:57,205
- Nothing's gonna happen.
- No, promise me still.

329
00:38:57,330 --> 00:39:01,709
- You'll take care of Chelsea.
- Of course, I promise.

330
00:39:01,835 --> 00:39:04,379
I love you.

331
00:39:04,504 --> 00:39:06,381
And I love you.

332
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:33,825
Yes?

333
00:39:34,701 --> 00:39:36,995
Dwight McDonald, Justice Department.

334
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:41,165
Professor Stewart,
we'd like to secure the building, sir.

335
00:39:45,712 --> 00:39:47,797
Professor Stewart?

336
00:39:50,383 --> 00:39:51,426
Olivia!

337
00:39:51,551 --> 00:39:53,428
How rude!

338
00:39:55,972 --> 00:39:58,057
- Olivia!
- Paul?

339
00:40:00,226 --> 00:40:05,607
Olivia! Get away quickly.
Use the fire escape. Quick!

340
00:40:06,274 --> 00:40:08,192
Gentlemen.

341
00:40:08,318 --> 00:40:11,613
- There he is!
- We're here!

342
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:30,840
Onward.

343
00:40:43,728 --> 00:40:48,232
- Where the hell is he?
- He's not gonna get away.

344
00:40:57,617 --> 00:40:59,827
- Bingo.
- There he is!

345
00:41:15,551 --> 00:41:17,678
- I'll get him.
- Check the other rooms.

346
00:41:17,845 --> 00:41:21,599
- That bitch is gonna die.
- Chicki, get that one.

347
00:41:21,724 --> 00:41:24,018
- Where is she?
- Not in there.

348
00:41:30,024 --> 00:41:32,735
She's gotta be up there. Chicki, let's go.

349
00:41:37,281 --> 00:41:38,533
Peekaboo.

350
00:41:44,997 --> 00:41:47,500
She's gotta be up there.

351
00:41:49,961 --> 00:41:51,504
Son of a bitch!

352
00:41:53,339 --> 00:41:56,050
Come on, Chicki, let's go!

353
00:42:04,225 --> 00:42:07,770
Chicki! Go help your brother.
I'll take care of her.

354
00:42:19,949 --> 00:42:22,285
Oh!

355
00:42:31,002 --> 00:42:32,003
Olivia!

356
00:43:08,456 --> 00:43:10,207
Ha!

357
00:43:10,333 --> 00:43:12,001
Better.

358
00:43:16,255 --> 00:43:18,257
Let's get outta here!

359
00:43:25,264 --> 00:43:29,727
OK. Check that side. Check the alley.
Check the alley. Move! Go!

360
00:43:39,403 --> 00:43:44,867
Tommy O'Shea was released
after questioning in the murder of Olivia Regent.

361
00:43:44,992 --> 00:43:48,037
Mr. O'Shea, what are your plans?

362
00:43:48,162 --> 00:43:51,707
I don't know. Might go fishing. I need a vacation.

363
00:43:51,832 --> 00:43:53,084
Seriously?

364
00:43:53,209 --> 00:43:58,172
Seriously, my life's a goddamn soap opera.
Tune in tomorrow.

365
00:43:59,757 --> 00:44:04,178
Lieutenant King, why did
the Organized Crime Bureau call in Mr. O'Shea?

366
00:44:04,303 --> 00:44:09,433
There is nothing unusual about this.
We always talk to ex-spouses of murder victims.

367
00:44:09,558 --> 00:44:14,480
- Yes, but don't you?
- Thank you, that's all we have to say.

368
00:44:36,919 --> 00:44:42,258
Look... Wait for me in the car.
I'd better do this by myself.

369
00:44:51,183 --> 00:44:54,603
- Hi, Paul.
- Say what you came to say.

370
00:44:56,647 --> 00:44:59,150
Chelsea, I'm so sorry about your mom.

371
00:45:03,279 --> 00:45:07,074
Paul, can... we talk?

372
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:13,289
- Every time I talk to you, somebody gets hurt.
- Listen to me.

373
00:45:13,414 --> 00:45:17,251
You come before the grand jury
and identify those guys who...

374
00:45:19,628 --> 00:45:23,174
One of those guys will give Tommy up in a deal.

375
00:45:23,299 --> 00:45:26,343
I'll airtight the case with other people,
not just you.

376
00:45:26,468 --> 00:45:29,388
Brian, get your men together and leave.

377
00:45:38,564 --> 00:45:41,692
Take your team back to headquarters.

378
00:45:44,028 --> 00:45:47,531
I miss mom. I wish she were here.

379
00:46:01,754 --> 00:46:05,215
Uh-huh. Uh-huh!

380
00:46:07,092 --> 00:46:09,136
Got you.

381
00:46:10,262 --> 00:46:13,474
You do good work, councilor.

382
00:46:14,642 --> 00:46:19,229
Well, boys. Tomorrow's the big day.

383
00:46:19,355 --> 00:46:24,360
- Big day? What big day?
- Baby's coming home to dada.

384
00:46:24,485 --> 00:46:27,571
- Is your daughter coming for a visit?
- What?

385
00:46:27,696 --> 00:46:33,202
- Your daughter, she's coming for a visit?
- No, she's coming here to live. Permanently.

386
00:46:33,661 --> 00:46:37,414
Gee, baby. I never knew you felt that way
about her.

387
00:46:40,668 --> 00:46:44,129
- What's mine is mine.
- What did you say?

388
00:46:46,131 --> 00:46:50,594
I don't know. I'm starting to mumble like you,
so I couldn't hear.

389
00:46:50,761 --> 00:46:52,846
What?

390
00:47:26,547 --> 00:47:30,175
Chelsea, don't forget your gloves and your hat.

391
00:47:32,136 --> 00:47:36,849
- I don't wanna go. I wanna stay with you.
- What's happening? What's going on?

392
00:47:38,392 --> 00:47:41,103
- Into the car, miss.
- What is this?

393
00:47:41,228 --> 00:47:46,275
I'm sorry, Professor Stewart.
He has the legal rights.

394
00:47:47,109 --> 00:47:50,070
I apologize, sir.

395
00:47:51,405 --> 00:47:54,700
Read it and weep. She's coming with me.

396
00:47:55,159 --> 00:47:57,369
Like hell she is.

397
00:48:05,419 --> 00:48:08,422
Son of a bitch is quick.

398
00:48:14,094 --> 00:48:16,972
Professor Stewart!

399
00:48:17,097 --> 00:48:21,143
Are you all right? What's happened?

400
00:48:21,268 --> 00:48:26,273
Professor, what's happened? What is it?

401
00:48:35,157 --> 00:48:40,913
Look at my face, Paul.
I can't let Tommy get away with this.

402
00:48:41,038 --> 00:48:45,250
Paul, if you'll just
come before the grand jury, identify those men...

403
00:48:45,375 --> 00:48:47,586
Gather your men together and leave.

404
00:48:47,711 --> 00:48:51,381
- Going back to your old ways?
- Is that a bad idea?

405
00:48:51,506 --> 00:48:55,594
- Let the law do it. Sometimes it works.
- Sometimes it doesn't.

406
00:48:55,719 --> 00:48:59,973
These people steal, murder,
destroy people's lives, and get away with it.

407
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:04,978
- Our hands are tied.
- I'm wasting my time with you guys.

408
00:49:38,845 --> 00:49:41,682
<i>- That looks perfect.
- Grazie,</i>

409
00:49:45,602 --> 00:49:48,397
- Hey, sis. How you doing?
- OK.

410
00:49:48,522 --> 00:49:53,944
- Hey, Sal, I gotta take a whiz.
- He's gotta take a whiz.

411
00:49:54,152 --> 00:49:56,405
- Where's mama?
- She's in the back.

412
00:49:56,530 --> 00:49:59,783
Chicki, your canoli's on the table
up front.

413
00:49:59,908 --> 00:50:02,953
I'll see Mama later.
I'll see Chicki at Tommy's.

414
00:50:03,078 --> 00:50:06,164
- You drive careful, Salvatore.
- Yeah, yeah.

415
00:50:06,373 --> 00:50:09,501
Congratulations,
you finally got a customer.

416
00:50:21,388 --> 00:50:25,434
- Can I have a refill of coffee, please?
- Sure.

417
00:50:25,559 --> 00:50:30,397
- Hey, buddy, finished with the papers?
- Help yourself.

418
00:50:42,284 --> 00:50:45,245
- There you go.
- Thanks.

419
00:51:06,433 --> 00:51:09,186
Anna, I love your canoli!

420
00:51:09,311 --> 00:51:13,482
Chicki, you eat too many,
you're gonna turn into a blimp.

421
00:51:13,607 --> 00:51:16,318
I'll be a happy blimp.

422
00:51:38,965 --> 00:51:44,471
Chicki, are you OK?
Chicki, are you OK? Chicki!

423
00:51:45,639 --> 00:51:47,724
Chicki, what's wrong?

424
00:51:48,642 --> 00:51:51,645
Chicki! Chicki!

425
00:51:51,770 --> 00:51:55,732
Help him, mister. Help him, come on!

426
00:51:55,857 --> 00:51:57,984
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

427
00:52:02,697 --> 00:52:05,951
Help! My brother! Help!

428
00:52:08,870 --> 00:52:11,414
Have you got a problem?

429
00:52:19,422 --> 00:52:23,301
- Chicki!
- All right, lady. All right.

430
00:52:32,769 --> 00:52:38,733
Father, God of all consolation,
in your unending love and mercy for us,

431
00:52:38,858 --> 00:52:43,363
you turn the darkness of death
into the dawn of new life.

432
00:52:43,488 --> 00:52:46,116
Show compassion to your people
in their sorrows.

433
00:52:46,241 --> 00:52:51,246
Be our refuge and our strength
to lift us from the darkness of this grief...

434
00:52:51,371 --> 00:52:54,040
Come on. It's OK.

435
00:52:54,165 --> 00:52:59,921
Your son, our Lord Jesus Christ,
by dying for us, conquered death.

436
00:53:00,046 --> 00:53:04,676
- We'll stand by you.
- He treated me like shit. Why do I miss him?

437
00:53:04,801 --> 00:53:09,681
- She's not holding up too well.
- I sure wouldn't want that to be me.

438
00:53:09,806 --> 00:53:12,559
...where every tear will be wiped away.

439
00:53:12,726 --> 00:53:15,937
We ask this through Christ our Lord, Amen.

440
00:53:26,281 --> 00:53:30,368
- Cyanide. Who would've?
- I haven't a clue.

441
00:53:30,493 --> 00:53:34,789
Everybody's going to ball games together.
It doesn't make any sense.

442
00:53:34,914 --> 00:53:39,627
Chicki. He had no concept of security.

443
00:53:39,753 --> 00:53:44,507
He was, like, naked.
You should learn from this.

444
00:53:44,632 --> 00:53:49,053
Sure, become a paranoid schizophrenic
like you.

445
00:53:49,179 --> 00:53:52,098
You got it wrong, Tommy.

446
00:53:52,223 --> 00:53:59,147
Protection is like being back
in your mother's womb, it's so safe.

447
00:53:59,272 --> 00:54:02,400
- Hey.
- Dandruff.

448
00:54:40,313 --> 00:54:42,106
- What?
- What happened?

449
00:54:45,902 --> 00:54:48,071
I have no idea.

450
00:54:50,657 --> 00:54:53,785
Oh, my God. Look at that.

451
00:55:01,501 --> 00:55:04,212
Oh, my Lord.

452
00:55:04,337 --> 00:55:09,884
Tommy really knows how to buy. This is
quality merchandise. This stuff is gonna sell.

453
00:55:10,009 --> 00:55:12,637
Way better than what that broad had.

454
00:55:12,804 --> 00:55:17,058
You're right, Sal.
Tommy's a genius. Yeah.

455
00:55:17,183 --> 00:55:19,978
Can somebody help me back here?

456
00:55:36,452 --> 00:55:38,121
Maxine.

457
00:55:39,455 --> 00:55:40,915
Max!

458
00:55:41,666 --> 00:55:44,669
- Slither over my way.
- What, baby?

459
00:55:47,088 --> 00:55:49,590
It's show time.

460
00:56:04,272 --> 00:56:08,818
- Something wrong?
- Just keep at it.

461
00:56:08,943 --> 00:56:11,904
Nothing's happening again.

462
00:56:11,988 --> 00:56:17,118
Any shit outta you,
I'll squeeze your head. Take a hike.

463
00:56:51,778 --> 00:56:54,864
Turn around. Are you ticklish?

464
00:56:54,989 --> 00:56:58,284
When you talk to your mother
do you do this?

465
00:56:58,409 --> 00:57:00,787
What do we have here?

466
00:57:03,414 --> 00:57:07,835
- Put it down.
- Yes, sir. Happy?

467
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:13,382
- Mr. Vasquez.
- Mr. O'Shea.

468
00:57:13,508 --> 00:57:18,221
I never thanked you personally
for that tip on Olivia.

469
00:57:18,346 --> 00:57:20,640
That's OK.

470
00:57:22,308 --> 00:57:25,186
The money was your thanks.

471
00:57:26,437 --> 00:57:28,940
Who killed Chick?

472
00:57:29,065 --> 00:57:33,319
Well, you got a problem.

473
00:57:33,402 --> 00:57:37,990
Ever hear the name Paul Kersey,
a vigilante killer a few years back?

474
00:57:38,115 --> 00:57:39,158
Oh, yeah.

475
00:57:39,283 --> 00:57:42,203
That was your ex-wife's boyfriend.

476
00:57:43,037 --> 00:57:44,372
Professor.

477
00:57:44,539 --> 00:57:46,707
- You people have him?
- Not any more.

478
00:57:46,832 --> 00:57:49,627
- He did Chicki?
- Kersey's no amateur.

479
00:57:50,586 --> 00:57:52,713
You pissed him off.

480
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:59,595
- How do we find him?
- I could remedy that situation.

481
00:58:00,763 --> 00:58:04,517
- But it's gonna cost you.
- No kidding?

482
00:58:06,310 --> 00:58:08,771
- Have at it.
- Deal.

483
00:58:12,775 --> 00:58:14,151
You know...

484
00:58:15,361 --> 00:58:18,531
Kersey's gonna be going down the list.

485
00:58:19,407 --> 00:58:21,951
Get it?

486
00:58:26,247 --> 00:58:28,541
- Hey, Hector.
- Yeah?

487
00:58:32,086 --> 00:58:34,547
Something you're wearing?

488
00:58:35,423 --> 00:58:38,759
I don't know, Tommy. Check Sal.

489
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:41,012
Scumbag.

490
00:58:50,062 --> 00:58:52,898
- Jesus Christ.
- What?

491
00:58:53,065 --> 00:58:56,610
- We gotta call Freddie.
- Don't worry about Freddie.

492
00:58:56,819 --> 00:59:01,032
You know Freddie. He's in the womb.

493
00:59:01,532 --> 00:59:02,575
What?

494
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:05,411
The womb.

495
00:59:56,212 --> 00:59:58,714
Hm. Birthday present?

496
00:59:59,298 --> 01:00:04,220
- A treat for someone special.
- How lovely. Won't they be surprised?

497
01:00:19,068 --> 01:00:22,738
You look great in that outfit.
Do you think it'll fit me?

498
01:00:22,863 --> 01:00:25,741
That depends. Are you into pain?

499
01:00:25,866 --> 01:00:30,412
- This is the only place I feel safe any more.
- Want some wine?

500
01:00:30,621 --> 01:00:33,874
You go ahead. I gotta keep my head clear.

501
01:00:37,211 --> 01:00:40,548
Of course the stress is making me itch.

502
01:00:40,714 --> 01:00:43,342
- Sure you don't want some wine?
- Yeah.

503
01:00:43,467 --> 01:00:47,346
- Maybe milk, to calm me down.
- No, milk's bad for dandruff.

504
01:00:47,471 --> 01:00:49,598
- Really?
- Yeah.

505
01:00:49,723 --> 01:00:53,519
I gotta get a new dermatologist.
That guy's a joke.

506
01:00:59,108 --> 01:01:01,652
- I'll give you some buttons to push.
- Yeah.

507
01:01:01,777 --> 01:01:05,447
- I just gotta calm down, you know.
- Oh, lighten up.

508
01:01:06,282 --> 01:01:08,242
You sound like Tommy.

509
01:01:08,367 --> 01:01:13,664
Tommy's being stupid and careless. He thinks
he's got some guns, some goons, he's safe.

510
01:01:13,789 --> 01:01:17,459
I'm worried about him.
He used to be smarter than that.

511
01:01:17,585 --> 01:01:21,672
What happens if Tommy goes down?
Will he be loyal to me?

512
01:01:41,358 --> 01:01:45,738
This stuff is supposed to kill every flake
on my head.

513
01:01:45,946 --> 01:01:52,619
- It smells like the stuff they use on cockroaches.
- Who are you calling a cockroach?

514
01:02:22,691 --> 01:02:24,568
Hey!

515
01:02:29,156 --> 01:02:31,658
Stay put. I'll be right back.

516
01:03:28,799 --> 01:03:30,843
Oh, God.

517
01:03:33,262 --> 01:03:34,763
Kids.

518
01:03:43,856 --> 01:03:46,692
Hey, Freddie!

519
01:03:46,817 --> 01:03:50,821
I'm gonna take care
of your dandruff problem for you.

520
01:03:50,988 --> 01:03:52,698
No!

521
01:03:55,158 --> 01:03:56,535
Freddie!

522
01:03:56,660 --> 01:03:59,746
Aagh!

523
01:04:14,553 --> 01:04:16,930
Aagh! No! Freddie!

524
01:04:32,362 --> 01:04:33,739
- Brian.
- Yeah?

525
01:04:33,905 --> 01:04:37,367
- I got some news.
- I don't want any more news.

526
01:04:37,492 --> 01:04:41,622
Sorry, I just got off the phone
with the mayor's assistant.

527
01:04:41,747 --> 01:04:45,584
- The mayor's on a rampage about this vigilante.
- I'm not surprised.

528
01:04:45,709 --> 01:04:49,171
- He's gonna call in a few minutes.
- The assistant?

529
01:04:49,296 --> 01:04:51,381
No, the mayor.

530
01:04:51,506 --> 01:04:55,844
First Paconi, then Flakes. He's going down
the list. Make sure O'Shea's covered.

531
01:04:55,969 --> 01:04:59,097
You got it.

532
01:05:01,224 --> 01:05:07,147
- You wanna get that?
- That's why they pay you the big bucks.

533
01:05:13,111 --> 01:05:14,154
Hoyle.

534
01:05:14,279 --> 01:05:18,992
- It's Paul, Brian.
- Where are you? We've looked all over for you.

535
01:05:19,117 --> 01:05:23,413
You can't take the law into your own hands.
Let me help you.

536
01:05:23,538 --> 01:05:28,960
You can help me by meeting me
at Olivia's house at 10. Come alone, will you?

537
01:05:29,961 --> 01:05:30,962
Paul?

538
01:05:36,968 --> 01:05:39,930
Honey, I gotta get off the phone.

539
01:06:47,038 --> 01:06:49,916
I didn't think it would be this easy, Kersey.

540
01:07:00,844 --> 01:07:02,596
Neither did I.

541
01:07:10,896 --> 01:07:15,317
You're right.
You can't trust the justice system.

542
01:07:16,276 --> 01:07:19,613
He would have killed you, Brian.

543
01:07:23,450 --> 01:07:25,160
Yeah.

544
01:07:31,541 --> 01:07:33,793
No judge, no jury...

545
01:07:35,253 --> 01:07:37,631
...no appeal and no deals.

546
01:07:37,756 --> 01:07:40,467
How do you feel about it?

547
01:07:41,676 --> 01:07:44,054
I'm scared.

548
01:07:45,889 --> 01:07:48,183
What are you gonna do?

549
01:07:53,647 --> 01:07:55,065
Paul...

550
01:07:56,816 --> 01:07:59,736
...I’m not even here.

551
01:08:11,414 --> 01:08:13,208
Let us pray.

552
01:08:13,333 --> 01:08:19,464
Lord, hear our prayers and be merciful to
your son whom you have called from this life.

553
01:08:19,589 --> 01:08:22,592
Welcome him into the company of your saints...

554
01:08:22,717 --> 01:08:25,345
- Terrible.
... in the kingdom of light and peace...

555
01:08:25,470 --> 01:08:29,682
But life goes on...

556
01:08:29,808 --> 01:08:35,688
Father, God of all consolation,
in your unending love and mercy for us...

557
01:08:37,941 --> 01:08:41,319
My children, please.
This is the house of the Lord.

558
01:08:41,986 --> 01:08:48,201
Put away those weapons.
My children, please. Let us continue.

559
01:08:49,452 --> 01:08:54,249
Show compassion to your people
in their sorrow...

560
01:08:54,374 --> 01:08:56,292
What is it?

561
01:08:56,418 --> 01:08:59,462
...to lift us from the darkness of this grief...

562
01:08:59,629 --> 01:09:01,965
It's the asshole.

563
01:09:02,090 --> 01:09:09,013
Your son, our Lord, Jesus Christ...
Where are you going, my children?

564
01:09:13,977 --> 01:09:15,812
- Tommy.
- What?

565
01:09:15,979 --> 01:09:17,814
Over there.

566
01:09:23,278 --> 01:09:26,614
Well, open the goddamn thing, dummy.

567
01:09:39,878 --> 01:09:48,136
You know, it's the first time I've ever looked
at that son of a bitch and it didn't irritate me.

568
01:09:55,602 --> 01:09:57,854
Ship him to Jersey.

569
01:10:34,390 --> 01:10:35,892
Max.

570
01:10:37,477 --> 01:10:40,772
A couple of cappuccinos

571
01:10:40,897 --> 01:10:43,316
and something to eat.

572
01:10:43,483 --> 01:10:47,862
Then upstairs and check out Chelsea.

573
01:10:58,790 --> 01:11:04,337
This is no good, Tommy.
This is a vendetta that we brought on ourselves.

574
01:11:04,462 --> 01:11:07,674
Now Vasquez is gone, that's terrific.

575
01:11:09,092 --> 01:11:13,888
- This is bad for business.
- Vasquez got what he deserved.

576
01:11:14,055 --> 01:11:16,974
We can always buy somebody else.

577
01:11:17,141 --> 01:11:20,853
Just concentrate on Kersey.
Concentrate on Kersey.

578
01:11:20,978 --> 01:11:25,525
Concentrate on Kersey. We got every
spare soldier out looking for that maniac.

579
01:11:25,650 --> 01:11:28,277
Jesus Christ, Tommy!

580
01:11:31,155 --> 01:11:36,536
I want out. As soon as we dust
this Kersey asshole, I want out.

581
01:11:36,619 --> 01:11:39,580
- That's it.
- What is it, Sallie?

582
01:11:39,664 --> 01:11:46,212
What do you mean? Look at me! My blood
pressure's going through the goddamn roof.

583
01:11:47,463 --> 01:11:51,342
Ever since Chicki's gone,
it don't make sense any more.

584
01:11:51,467 --> 01:11:54,595
Your blood pressure, part of it's your diet.

585
01:11:54,762 --> 01:11:58,307
You eat like you're going to the electric chair.

586
01:11:58,433 --> 01:12:02,353
I don't need you to tell me how to eat.

587
01:12:02,478 --> 01:12:04,605
Concentrate on Kersey.

588
01:12:06,107 --> 01:12:09,861
I think we oughta give the lamb to the wolf.

589
01:12:10,027 --> 01:12:16,117
- We'll catch Kersey using Chelsea as bait.
- What are you talking about? Lamb, wolf?

590
01:12:16,784 --> 01:12:21,747
Kersey, he knows every move we're making,

591
01:12:21,873 --> 01:12:24,417
and somebody's helping him out.

592
01:12:26,961 --> 01:12:29,172
You're the lamb, Sallie.

593
01:12:29,297 --> 01:12:32,884
- Are you selling me out? No!
- No, listen to me.

594
01:12:33,009 --> 01:12:37,138
Do the same thing you do every Sunday,
go to church,

595
01:12:37,263 --> 01:12:40,975
drop the cash at Olivia's,
do everything like on Sunday.

596
01:12:41,100 --> 01:12:43,853
Sure, and get barbecued like Freddie Flakes.

597
01:12:43,978 --> 01:12:46,772
He won't get near you, I promise.

598
01:12:46,856 --> 01:12:49,358
You promise. You promise.

599
01:12:50,234 --> 01:12:54,113
So I pick Chelsea up here
and Kersey's gonna do nothing?

600
01:12:54,238 --> 01:12:58,284
No, you lead him to the factory
and right into the trap.

601
01:12:58,409 --> 01:13:01,787
Don't they look nice?

602
01:13:01,954 --> 01:13:04,582
There she is.

603
01:13:04,707 --> 01:13:09,420
Poor, sweet, dim-witted Max.

604
01:13:09,545 --> 01:13:12,673
- Our resident retard.
- What?

605
01:13:12,798 --> 01:13:17,094
Chicki choked to death on a canoli.
Do you not remember?

606
01:13:17,261 --> 01:13:20,514
If you had a brain, you would play with it!

607
01:13:21,474 --> 01:13:24,060
- Don't!
- Moron!

608
01:14:21,075 --> 01:14:26,205
Hello, Tommy? I got Kersey on my tail.
I'm going to pick up Chelsea.

609
01:15:22,970 --> 01:15:25,681
Hi, sweetheart.

610
01:15:25,764 --> 01:15:32,771
Tommy? Yeah, I got Chelsea.
Get everybody ready. We're on our way.

611
01:15:47,286 --> 01:15:51,373
Angel, check out the toys.

612
01:15:54,627 --> 01:15:57,880
Let's rock and roll!

613
01:15:59,006 --> 01:16:00,591
All right.

614
01:16:01,634 --> 01:16:04,553
Rock and roll your butts downstairs.

615
01:16:04,678 --> 01:16:09,767
And give Mr. Kersey the warmest of welcomes.

616
01:16:10,643 --> 01:16:13,437
Let's do it. Come on.

617
01:16:33,666 --> 01:16:35,417
Stay there.

618
01:16:38,254 --> 01:16:42,132
Now, come on. Let's go.

619
01:16:48,097 --> 01:16:49,890
Hey, hey!

620
01:16:52,101 --> 01:16:53,644
Get in there!

621
01:17:18,752 --> 01:17:23,966
You guys in position?
Kersey should be showing up any time.

622
01:17:25,551 --> 01:17:29,471
- Kersey won't know what hit him.
- Make him suffer.

623
01:17:47,656 --> 01:17:51,702
He's right behind me, the asshole.
He's walking right into it.

624
01:17:51,827 --> 01:17:53,454
Wonderful.

625
01:17:54,872 --> 01:17:56,498
Chelsea.

626
01:17:56,623 --> 01:17:59,126
Chelsea, come here.

627
01:18:00,711 --> 01:18:05,466
You'd better come over here,
you stubborn little shit.

628
01:18:05,591 --> 01:18:08,886
- No.
- Hey, do what your father tells you.

629
01:18:09,011 --> 01:18:11,889
You spoilt little brat.

630
01:18:39,833 --> 01:18:42,169
He's inside.

631
01:19:23,877 --> 01:19:25,170
Shit!

632
01:21:04,644 --> 01:21:06,855
He's history.

633
01:21:08,064 --> 01:21:09,816
Shit.

634
01:21:31,004 --> 01:21:33,632
Aagh!

635
01:21:59,282 --> 01:22:02,410
- Where's the girl?
- Don't know.

636
01:22:23,348 --> 01:22:25,058
Frankie?

637
01:22:26,351 --> 01:22:27,727
Frankie?

638
01:22:31,773 --> 01:22:32,941
Mickey.

639
01:22:34,317 --> 01:22:35,569
Mickey?

640
01:22:37,654 --> 01:22:41,157
Son of a bitch. Angel?

641
01:22:41,324 --> 01:22:45,954
- How many more of you are there?
- I don't know.

642
01:22:46,079 --> 01:22:47,580
Angel!

643
01:22:52,002 --> 01:22:54,129
Frankie!

644
01:22:58,466 --> 01:23:02,053
Get up there. Get up there!

645
01:23:03,847 --> 01:23:06,641
I'll take the walkie-talkie.

646
01:23:13,398 --> 01:23:16,568
- What are you gonna do?
- Help you remember.

647
01:23:16,693 --> 01:23:19,279
Hold that. Hold it!

648
01:23:34,377 --> 01:23:36,838
Come on, Kersey.

649
01:23:38,381 --> 01:23:41,468
What's this all about?

650
01:23:41,634 --> 01:23:45,263
I don't know nothing.
Come on.

651
01:23:46,598 --> 01:23:49,017
Come on, Kersey.

652
01:24:07,077 --> 01:24:09,079
Memory any better?

653
01:24:23,968 --> 01:24:27,597
- Where's the girl?
- She's upstairs in the big room.

654
01:24:27,722 --> 01:24:31,392
- Anybody with her?
- Sal and Tommy.

655
01:24:46,157 --> 01:24:48,284
Sh!

656
01:25:06,052 --> 01:25:12,392
Frankie. Where've you been?
How've you been doing?

657
01:25:15,311 --> 01:25:17,772
Did you get Kersey?

658
01:25:18,856 --> 01:25:21,401
Answer me!

659
01:25:22,819 --> 01:25:25,655
I'm coming for you, O'Shea.

660
01:25:25,780 --> 01:25:30,451
- Paul! Paul!
- Don't just stand there, for Christ's sake!

661
01:25:30,577 --> 01:25:31,953
Moron.

662
01:25:36,541 --> 01:25:37,917
Sal!

663
01:25:39,627 --> 01:25:43,298
- Sal!
- What? Tommy, the kid's getting away.

664
01:25:44,549 --> 01:25:47,677
You go that way. I'll meet you in the showroom.

665
01:26:22,628 --> 01:26:24,589
Paul?

666
01:26:24,714 --> 01:26:27,383
Paul, are you here?

667
01:26:28,676 --> 01:26:30,345
Paul?

668
01:26:48,613 --> 01:26:52,075
Don't even think it.

669
01:26:54,786 --> 01:26:59,040
- Paul! Help me!
- Stop! Dammit!

670
01:27:02,460 --> 01:27:03,669
Paul!

671
01:27:03,795 --> 01:27:05,880
Paul, where are you?

672
01:27:32,740 --> 01:27:33,825
Sal!

673
01:27:39,747 --> 01:27:40,915
Sal!

674
01:27:43,584 --> 01:27:45,461
Jesus!

675
01:27:45,878 --> 01:27:47,547
Sal!

676
01:28:12,572 --> 01:28:13,865
Kersey!

677
01:28:16,701 --> 01:28:18,995
Shit!

678
01:28:22,874 --> 01:28:26,085
Kersey, I'm unarmed.

679
01:28:27,712 --> 01:28:31,465
I have no gun, right?

680
01:28:31,632 --> 01:28:34,677
You wouldn't shoot an unarmed man,
would you?

681
01:28:35,428 --> 01:28:36,596
Kersey?

682
01:29:08,044 --> 01:29:11,589
Paul! Please, help me!

683
01:29:14,008 --> 01:29:15,051
Paul!

684
01:29:21,390 --> 01:29:22,683
Paul!

685
01:29:27,188 --> 01:29:29,106
Paul, help me!

686
01:29:29,231 --> 01:29:31,942
- Hey!
- Paul?

687
01:29:33,361 --> 01:29:36,322
Paul, where are you?

688
01:29:42,495 --> 01:29:44,830
Aagh!

689
01:29:44,997 --> 01:29:48,167
How does that feel, you son of a bitch?

690
01:29:48,292 --> 01:29:50,336
Bastard!

691
01:30:00,888 --> 01:30:04,600
- Are you all right? Where's Paul?
- He's upstairs with Tommy.

692
01:30:08,479 --> 01:30:10,898
Guns make you nervous?

693
01:30:13,651 --> 01:30:17,113
Do you want me to beg, you son of a bitch?

694
01:30:17,905 --> 01:30:21,867
Please. Please.

695
01:30:21,992 --> 01:30:23,077
No!

696
01:30:25,121 --> 01:30:26,914
- Freeze, scumbag!
- Frozen.

697
01:30:35,089 --> 01:30:36,549
Wait!

698
01:30:38,259 --> 01:30:39,802
Listen.

699
01:30:41,971 --> 01:30:44,598
Whatever you want,

700
01:30:44,723 --> 01:30:47,518
whatever you need.

701
01:30:49,854 --> 01:30:52,273
I don't need anything.

702
01:30:52,398 --> 01:30:55,943
But you, you need a bath.

703
01:30:58,487 --> 01:31:00,281
No!

704
01:31:32,688 --> 01:31:35,733
- You OK?
- Yeah, I think so.

705
01:31:35,858 --> 01:31:41,030
- What are you going to do about me?
- Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

706
01:31:41,155 --> 01:31:44,033
The girl's outside. She's safe.

707
01:31:45,242 --> 01:31:47,244
Thanks, Lieutenant.

708
01:31:51,832 --> 01:31:56,086
Hey, Lieutenant,
if you need any help, give me a call.
