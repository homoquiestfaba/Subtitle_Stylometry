20
00:01:44,999 --> 00:01:45,998
Yeah?

21
00:01:45,999 --> 00:01:47,998
You need some work, though,
if you can get to it.

22
00:01:47,999 --> 00:01:48,998
Okay, I'll take a look.

23
00:01:48,999 --> 00:01:49,998
Good to see you.

24
00:01:49,999 --> 00:01:51,999
See you, Mr. McHenry.

25
00:02:28,999 --> 00:02:31,998
Tommy.Hi, dad.

Get the stick.Get the stick.

27
00:02:32,999 --> 00:02:33,998
Good boy.

28
00:02:33,999 --> 00:02:35,998
You got him trained? Sort of.

29
00:02:35,999 --> 00:02:41,998
It just must be the center of our concerns,

30
00:02:41,999 --> 00:02:44,998
but we will not permit those

31
00:02:44,999 --> 00:02:48,998
who fire upon us in Vietnam

32
00:02:48,999 --> 00:02:50,998
to win a victory

33
00:02:50,999 --> 00:02:52,998
over the desires

34
00:02:52,999 --> 00:02:54,998
and the intentions

35
00:02:54,999 --> 00:02:58,998
of all the American people.

36
00:02:58,999 --> 00:03:01,998
Smells good, Ruth.

37
00:03:01,999 --> 00:03:04,998
They only got a few yearsto
go to end this war

38
00:03:04,999 --> 00:03:06,998
before Tommy's old enoughto go.

39
00:03:06,999 --> 00:03:09,999

I don't see itlasting till 1970.

41
00:03:13,999 --> 00:03:15,998
Do you, Ruth?

42
00:03:15,999 --> 00:03:18,998
Lord, I hope not.

43
00:03:18,999 --> 00:03:21,998
Are you going to be here
forsupper tonight, Mr. McHenry?

44
00:03:21,999 --> 00:03:22,999
No, I've got to go into town.

45
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:24,998
I'll pick up something.

47
00:03:28,334 --> 00:03:35,999

48
00:03:42,999 --> 00:03:50,999

49
00:03:53,999 --> 00:03:55,998

50
00:03:55,999 --> 00:03:56,998

I'm a seamstress myself,

58
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:11,751

59
00:04:11,999 --> 00:04:12,998
that if you'd recommend
meto any of your customers

60
00:04:12,999 --> 00:04:14,998

00:04:14,999 --> 00:04:18,998
I'd be very happy to give youa
percentage of whati charge them

62
00:04:18,999 --> 00:04:22,998

raisinga daughter by myself,

63
00:04:22,999 --> 00:04:25,999
and I'm just... I'm
trying to make ends meet.

64
00:04:32,999 --> 00:04:35,998
Fucking sack of shit.

65
00:04:35,999 --> 00:04:36,998
Typical... typical raise.

66
00:04:36,999 --> 00:04:39,501
Oh. Anti up.

67
00:04:39,999 --> 00:04:42,998

68
00:04:42,999 --> 00:04:44,998
Clayton fritzsimmons.

69
00:04:44,999 --> 00:04:46,998
Crazy son of a bitch,

00:04:46,999 --> 00:04:49,998
real sharp lookingpiece of shit.

71
00:04:49,999 --> 00:04:50,998
Drunk all the time.

72
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:52,998
Fuck anything.

73
00:04:52,999 --> 00:04:54,998
Had what he had at home,

74
00:04:54,999 --> 00:04:56,998
go out and fuck anything.

75
00:04:56,999 --> 00:04:58,998
Wild temper.

76
00:04:58,999 --> 00:04:59,998
Wild man.

77
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:01,998
Could play cards with you.

78
00:05:01,999 --> 00:05:03,998
Drove like a maniac.

79
00:05:03,999 --> 00:05:05,998
It finally killed hima few years back.

80
00:05:05,999 --> 00:05:08,998
I didn't ask about him.I asked about her.

81
00:05:08,999 --> 00:05:10,998
I dated her once.

82
00:05:10,999 --> 00:05:12,998
She went out with you?

83
00:05:12,999 --> 00:05:13,999
Fuck you, yes.

84
00:05:14,584 --> 00:05:18,998
Well, wasn't exactly a date.
We had coffee in a diner.

85
00:05:18,999 --> 00:05:19,998
She was sitting therewith a cup of coffee.

86
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:21,998
I sat down.

87
00:05:21,999 --> 00:05:24,998
Highly attractive.

88
00:05:24,999 --> 00:05:27,998
Jay, she's too prettyfor you.

89
00:05:27,999 --> 00:05:30,999
Oh...

90
00:05:43,999 --> 00:05:45,998
You the big winner?

91
00:05:45,999 --> 00:05:49,998
Tonight I was.

92
00:05:49,999 --> 00:05:51,751
You always win.

93
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:52,998
Nobody wins all the time, joleen.

94
00:05:52,999 --> 00:05:54,999
That's whythey call it gambling.

95
00:05:57,999 --> 00:05:59,998
It's too early to go home.
Where are we going?

96
00:05:59,999 --> 00:06:03,998
Look. Louis is going to bewalking
out the doorany second now.

97
00:06:03,999 --> 00:06:05,998
Now, come on. Why don't you
just getout of the car

98
00:06:05,999 --> 00:06:07,999
and go on home with him.Okay?

99
00:06:09,999 --> 00:06:10,999
I'd rather not.

100
00:06:20,999 --> 00:06:22,999
Get down. Get down.

101
00:06:35,999 --> 00:06:36,998
Joleen.

102
00:06:36,999 --> 00:06:38,999
I got a feeling here.

103
00:06:42,999 --> 00:06:45,999
I can't keep going onwith you.

104
00:06:48,999 --> 00:06:49,999
Why not?

105
00:06:52,999 --> 00:06:53,999
It's not right.

106
00:06:57,999 --> 00:07:00,998
God's going to punish
you'cause of your wife?

107
00:07:00,999 --> 00:07:01,998
Yeah, maybe,

108
00:07:01,999 --> 00:07:03,998
and your husband.

109
00:07:03,999 --> 00:07:07,999
Honey, she is nevergoing to know.

110
00:07:09,999 --> 00:07:11,998
And she's never comingout of that home.

111
00:07:11,999 --> 00:07:13,000
You know it.

112
00:07:18,999 --> 00:07:20,439
I'm going to tell louisall about us.

113
00:07:21,999 --> 00:07:23,999
That's right.

114
00:07:25,999 --> 00:07:27,584
All about us.

115
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:28,999
How do you like that?

116
00:07:32,999 --> 00:07:34,998
You think that you can justuse
me like some dish rag

117
00:07:34,999 --> 00:07:36,998
and then toss mewhen you're finished?

118
00:07:36,999 --> 00:07:38,998
Like I got no feelingsabout this,

119
00:07:38,999 --> 00:07:39,999
no say in the matter?

120
00:07:41,999 --> 00:07:45,998
Well, I can be a bitterand
a vengeful woman, reece.

121
00:07:45,999 --> 00:07:47,999
You have misjudged me.

122
00:07:48,042 --> 00:07:50,999
I don't think I have.

123
00:07:54,999 --> 00:07:56,998
That wife of yoursis a
perfect shield against me.

124
00:07:56,999 --> 00:07:57,999
Isn't she?

125
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:01,999
Against Carol Fitzsimmons.

126
00:08:07,999 --> 00:08:09,998
What do you know about Carol?

127
00:08:09,999 --> 00:08:11,998
I know that she's beencoming around you

128
00:08:11,999 --> 00:08:13,998
and insinuating herselfinto your life.

129
00:08:13,999 --> 00:08:16,998
But you want to be free.

130
00:08:16,999 --> 00:08:17,998
Free? I'm not free.

131
00:08:17,999 --> 00:08:21,998
Oh, yes, you are.

132
00:08:21,999 --> 00:08:24,998
Nobody's figured that
out yetbut me and you,

133
00:08:24,999 --> 00:08:25,998
and that's the beauty of it. Isn't it?

134
00:08:25,999 --> 00:08:27,998
You can cat around

135
00:08:27,999 --> 00:08:29,998
without having to reportto anybody.

136
00:08:29,999 --> 00:08:32,998
But if somebodystarts getting too close,

137
00:08:32,999 --> 00:08:35,998
you have gotthe perfect excuse,

138
00:08:35,999 --> 00:08:37,999
the perfect responsibility,

139
00:08:38,751 --> 00:08:39,998
just lying up therein that hospital bed,

140
00:08:39,999 --> 00:08:42,998
and you can't deny it. It's the
truth, and you know it is.

141
00:08:42,999 --> 00:08:43,998
Look, let's getsomething straight.
All right?

142
00:08:43,999 --> 00:08:46,998
I am not leavingthe woman I married,

143
00:08:46,999 --> 00:08:47,998
even if she laysin that hospital bed

144
00:08:47,999 --> 00:08:48,998
for the rest of my life.

145
00:08:48,999 --> 00:08:51,999
What a waste, reece.

146
00:08:53,999 --> 00:08:56,998
You're younger than me,

147
00:08:56,999 --> 00:08:59,998
a lot younger.

148
00:08:59,999 --> 00:09:01,998
And I'm not burdenedby pesky traits

149
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:04,998
like moralityand strength of character.

150
00:09:04,999 --> 00:09:06,998
Yeah, I've got a lot of those, obviously.

151
00:09:06,999 --> 00:09:08,279
I'm here withanother man's wife.

152
00:09:13,999 --> 00:09:18,998
Where you going now? You going
to go bythe little shop?

153
00:09:18,999 --> 00:09:19,998
I might.

154
00:09:19,999 --> 00:09:21,998
You might?

155
00:09:21,999 --> 00:09:23,999
You might? You might see Carol.

156
00:09:24,999 --> 00:09:27,998
Tell me something, reece.

157
00:09:27,999 --> 00:09:30,125
Have you sleptwith the poor widow already,

158
00:09:30,999 --> 00:09:33,999

159
00:09:36,999 --> 00:09:38,999

00:10:51,999 --> 00:10:55,998
Um, yes... oh, actually,
yes, I'm staying at...

185
00:10:55,999 --> 00:10:57,998
I'm cabin five.

186
00:10:57,999 --> 00:10:58,998
Really? Mm-hm.

187
00:10:58,999 --> 00:10:59,998
I'll be darned. I'm in seven.

188
00:10:59,999 --> 00:11:00,998
No, are you really? Mm-hm.

189
00:11:00,999 --> 00:11:02,998
Coincidence.How did that happen?

190
00:11:02,999 --> 00:11:04,999
Thank you.

191
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:07,998
Um... Hot dog?

192
00:11:07,999 --> 00:11:09,998
Sure, I'd love a hot dog.

193
00:11:09,999 --> 00:11:11,998
That would be good. And also a beer.

194
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:13,360
Couple hot dogs? Yeah, and a beer.

195
00:11:15,999 --> 00:11:16,998
I always said words funny.

196
00:11:16,999 --> 00:11:17,998
You did? Mm-hm.

197
00:11:17,999 --> 00:11:18,998
What do you mean?

198
00:11:18,999 --> 00:11:20,998
I thought that bouillabaisse

199
00:11:20,999 --> 00:11:22,998
was pronounced "boolabase."

200
00:11:22,999 --> 00:11:26,998
I thought it was a soup, boolabase.

201
00:11:26,999 --> 00:11:27,998
Boola.

202
00:11:27,999 --> 00:11:31,998
I had no idea what"boola" was, "boo-ah."

203
00:11:31,999 --> 00:11:34,998
Boola, boola.I don't...

204
00:11:34,999 --> 00:11:37,998
What... what becameof your husband?

205
00:11:37,999 --> 00:11:39,999
Oh...

206
00:11:41,999 --> 00:11:42,998
Well, he was killedin a car wreck

207
00:11:42,999 --> 00:11:46,998
off the highwayabout four years ago.

208
00:11:46,999 --> 00:11:48,998
Mm, sorry to hear that.

209
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:50,999
Yeah.

210
00:11:51,459 --> 00:11:53,998
Your wife?

211
00:11:53,999 --> 00:11:57,998
Um...

212
00:11:57,999 --> 00:11:59,792
She... do you wantanother beer?

213
00:11:59,999 --> 00:12:00,999
Mm-hm.

214
00:12:05,999 --> 00:12:07,998
Oh, do know who vin Scully is?

215
00:12:07,999 --> 00:12:09,998
Baseball guy?

216
00:12:09,999 --> 00:12:10,998
Yes, sports announcer.

217
00:12:10,999 --> 00:12:14,998
I thought his name
waspronounced Vince kully.

218
00:12:14,999 --> 00:12:18,998
Vince kully.

219
00:12:18,999 --> 00:12:19,998
Oh, dear.

220
00:12:19,999 --> 00:12:21,998
It's hopeless.

221
00:12:21,999 --> 00:12:22,998
I can understand.

222
00:12:22,999 --> 00:12:24,998
Are you having any luckwith that?

223
00:12:24,999 --> 00:12:26,998
Turned out to be little
bittougher than I thought it was.

224
00:12:26,999 --> 00:12:28,998
Really? I'm sorry.

225
00:12:28,999 --> 00:12:29,998
I shouldn't have asked you.

226
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:30,999
You didn't ask.

227
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:32,998
I volunteered.

228
00:12:32,999 --> 00:12:34,998
Really, no. No, I should've
calledthe plumber.

229
00:12:34,999 --> 00:12:35,998
No, I can... I can fix it, but...

230
00:12:35,999 --> 00:12:38,998
You can?

231
00:12:38,999 --> 00:12:42,999
Uh, plumber would probablyfix it right.

232
00:12:44,999 --> 00:12:45,998
Yeah? What?

233
00:12:45,999 --> 00:12:48,042
Wait, you knowi'm still married.

234
00:12:48,999 --> 00:12:50,998
I mean, you knowthe
circumstances.I'm still married.

235
00:12:50,999 --> 00:12:52,998
What, are you afraidyour wife's
suddenlygoing to wake up?

236
00:12:52,999 --> 00:12:53,998
No. Things are going to beback to normal?

237
00:12:53,999 --> 00:12:55,998
She's going to walk in on us

238
00:12:55,999 --> 00:12:57,417
or something like that?

239
00:12:57,999 --> 00:12:58,998
No, but... What?

240
00:12:58,999 --> 00:13:00,998
To have a steady girlfriend,

241
00:13:00,999 --> 00:13:02,998
you think that'sthe right thing to do?

242
00:13:02,999 --> 00:13:03,998
Oh, wait a minute. Have I
missed something here?

243
00:13:03,999 --> 00:13:07,998
Who asked you if you
wanteda steady girlfriend?

244
00:13:07,999 --> 00:13:10,998
I just thought it wasin the air.

245
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:12,998
Don't try and read my mind. Okay?

246
00:13:12,999 --> 00:13:13,999
I'm sorry.

247
00:13:14,999 --> 00:13:15,998
You should be.

248
00:13:15,999 --> 00:13:16,998
You should be really sorry

249
00:13:16,999 --> 00:13:19,998
because I have a boyfriend.

250
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,999
You do?

251
00:13:22,999 --> 00:13:23,998
You don't.

252
00:13:23,999 --> 00:13:25,998
Oh, he's so surprised.

253
00:13:25,999 --> 00:13:26,998
You can't believe it, huh?

254
00:13:26,999 --> 00:13:27,998
No, I mean I...

255
00:13:27,999 --> 00:13:28,998
that's right.I have a boyfriend.

256
00:13:28,999 --> 00:13:29,998
I didn't know.

257
00:13:29,999 --> 00:13:31,998
Well, now you know.

258
00:13:31,999 --> 00:13:32,998
And I don't need you to makeany phone calls

259
00:13:32,999 --> 00:13:33,998
for me either

260
00:13:33,999 --> 00:13:35,998
because I can callmr. Quillet myself.

261
00:13:35,999 --> 00:13:37,998
You see, I'm not helpless. Right.

262
00:13:37,999 --> 00:13:38,998
Because you know what?

263
00:13:38,999 --> 00:13:40,998
We're not livingin the dark ages.

264
00:13:40,999 --> 00:13:41,999
This is the 1960s,

265
00:13:42,918 --> 00:13:43,998
so you better wake up

266
00:13:43,999 --> 00:13:46,998
because women can calltheir own plumbers

267
00:13:46,999 --> 00:13:48,998
and women, too...

268
00:13:48,999 --> 00:13:51,039
can enjoy themselveswith
their... you know, their...

269
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:54,999
their boyfriends and...

270
00:13:58,999 --> 00:14:00,998
Somebody who isn't their...

271
00:14:00,999 --> 00:14:02,999
what are you doing? Their boyfriends.

272
00:14:49,999 --> 00:14:50,998
What's going on?

273
00:14:50,999 --> 00:14:51,998
What do you mean?

274
00:14:51,999 --> 00:14:53,998
I mean, what the hell's going on?

275
00:14:53,999 --> 00:14:55,998
Your boyfriend hereor something?

276
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:56,998
I have company, yes.

277
00:14:56,999 --> 00:14:57,998
Carol?

278
00:14:57,999 --> 00:14:59,998
What? What aboutthis afternoon?

279
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:01,998
You know, the plumbing and every...

280
00:15:01,999 --> 00:15:02,998
what are you talking about? I mean, I...

281
00:15:02,999 --> 00:15:04,998
you know whati'm talking about.

282
00:15:04,999 --> 00:15:05,998
No, I don't knowwhat you're talking...

283
00:15:05,999 --> 00:15:06,998
vin Scully and...

284
00:15:06,999 --> 00:15:08,998
We had sexon the bathroom floor.

285
00:15:08,999 --> 00:15:09,998
You barely said a word to me.

286
00:15:09,999 --> 00:15:11,998
You left.

287
00:15:11,999 --> 00:15:13,560
I had no ideayou were coming over here.

288
00:15:13,999 --> 00:15:14,998
Well, I'm here now.I'm here now.

289
00:15:14,999 --> 00:15:17,998
Well, you're here, and I have a guest.

290
00:15:17,999 --> 00:15:19,998
Okay? Excuse me.

291
00:15:19,999 --> 00:15:21,999
Hey! No. I mean it. Good-bye.

292
00:15:41,999 --> 00:15:42,999
Ah!

293
00:15:46,999 --> 00:15:48,999
Getting wet? Oh! Oh.

294
00:15:51,999 --> 00:15:53,998
Look, is there any reasonwhy
we can't be friends?

295
00:15:53,999 --> 00:15:56,998
I just... Well, no. I'd like that.

296
00:15:56,999 --> 00:15:58,998
Well, I mean, there, for a while,
you were coming around, and...

297
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:00,998
I don't you know... you stopped and...

298
00:16:00,999 --> 00:16:02,998
I thought we had a
fight.Well, that was a...

299
00:16:02,999 --> 00:16:06,998
A fight is when youand your
husband exchange blows,

300
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:07,998
when the house is destroyed,

301
00:16:07,999 --> 00:16:11,998
when the horrible wordsyou
scream at each other

302
00:16:11,999 --> 00:16:13,998
echo years and years later,

303
00:16:13,999 --> 00:16:15,998
when he gets into a carand
drives it off into the night

304
00:16:15,999 --> 00:16:18,998
to burn to deathoff some old highway,

305
00:16:18,999 --> 00:16:20,998
and your only daughterforever
has screamingnightmares, reece.

306
00:16:20,999 --> 00:16:23,998
That's what a fight is.
What did we have then?

307
00:16:23,999 --> 00:16:25,998
We had a few words.

308
00:16:25,999 --> 00:16:28,998
Well, here's a few more.

309
00:16:28,999 --> 00:16:30,998
I don't particularly likegene Hamlin.

310
00:16:30,999 --> 00:16:32,998
I recognized his car.

311
00:16:32,999 --> 00:16:34,998
Gene Hamlin happens to bea very nice man.

312
00:16:34,999 --> 00:16:38,998
Don't tell me about him.You play poker with
a man, you get to know him pretty fast.

313
00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:39,998
Well, I'm sorryif you don't approve, so...

314
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,998
Look, I don't wannaargue with you.

315
00:16:41,999 --> 00:16:44,999
Well, anyway, look, I should be going.

316
00:16:47,999 --> 00:16:52,998
So... friends or...

317
00:16:52,999 --> 00:16:55,998
Look, it's Wednesday afternoon,

318
00:16:55,999 --> 00:16:57,998
it's raining, and I already let my girl go.

319
00:16:57,999 --> 00:17:00,998
Why don't I just close shop,

320
00:17:00,999 --> 00:17:03,998
and we could, uh, take a little drive?

321
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:06,998
What do you say?

322
00:17:06,999 --> 00:17:09,998
Do you evergo to the movies?

323
00:17:09,999 --> 00:17:10,998
No. I never do.

324
00:17:10,999 --> 00:17:12,998
Do you know that one ofmy
favorite things in life

325
00:17:12,999 --> 00:17:14,998
is to go to the moviesin the afternoon?

326
00:17:14,999 --> 00:17:16,998
Yeah?

327
00:17:16,999 --> 00:17:17,998
Yeah.

328
00:17:17,999 --> 00:17:21,999
Especially if it's raining.

329
00:17:41,999 --> 00:17:43,998
What was I saying?

330
00:17:43,999 --> 00:17:44,998
Sex.

331
00:17:44,999 --> 00:17:46,998
Oh, yes.

332
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:48,998
I was hoping you'd forgotten.

333
00:17:48,999 --> 00:17:51,998
Um...

334
00:17:51,999 --> 00:17:53,998
Well, we just had do you see

335
00:17:53,999 --> 00:17:56,998
that couple? A pretty
good sex life, you know?

336
00:17:56,999 --> 00:17:59,999
It just was very...

337
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:05,999
I just...

338
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:11,998
I enjoy sex. It was nice.

339
00:18:11,999 --> 00:18:15,998
We were pretty wild, Martin and me.

340
00:18:15,999 --> 00:18:19,998
Tell me what you mean by that. What
do you mean you were pretty wild?

341
00:18:19,999 --> 00:18:21,998
Well...

342
00:18:21,999 --> 00:18:23,998
We had a good sex life.

343
00:18:23,999 --> 00:18:24,543
Come on.

344
00:18:28,999 --> 00:18:30,998
Reece, what are you doing?

345
00:18:30,999 --> 00:18:31,998
Nothing.

346
00:18:31,999 --> 00:18:33,998
You were waitingto see them, weren't you?

347
00:18:33,999 --> 00:18:34,998
No, no, no. Yes, you were.

348
00:18:34,999 --> 00:18:36,998
No. Look, aren't you curious?

349
00:18:36,999 --> 00:18:38,998
Do you wanna stayand see who they are?

350
00:18:38,999 --> 00:18:41,998
I think we should tellthe manager that
if wewanna see that kind of thing,

351
00:18:41,999 --> 00:18:42,998
we can just goto the drive-in.

352
00:18:42,999 --> 00:18:45,998
We were young once.

353
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:46,998
Okay. Okay, we forgive them.

354
00:18:46,999 --> 00:18:49,998
We won't tell the manager. Okay.

355
00:18:49,999 --> 00:18:51,998
Now, do you thinkthey're gonna
stayand see the whole movie?

356
00:18:51,999 --> 00:18:53,998
Yes, if they didn'tsee it the first time.

357
00:18:53,999 --> 00:18:56,998
Oh, lookit. You see that? You
know what that is? What?

358
00:18:56,999 --> 00:18:59,998
No. What is that? That is
a sonybetamax machine.

359
00:18:59,999 --> 00:19:02,998
Uh-huh. What's it do? Well,
it shows you moviesat home.

360
00:19:02,999 --> 00:19:03,998
Home movies? Yep.

361
00:19:03,999 --> 00:19:05,998
Wow.Well, no.

362
00:19:05,999 --> 00:19:08,998
You have a motion pictureon
a videocassette tape.

363
00:19:08,999 --> 00:19:12,998
And you stick it in that thing, and it
shows you the movieon your t.V. Screen.

364
00:19:12,999 --> 00:19:14,998
I don't understand that. Why
would you wanna do that?

365
00:19:14,999 --> 00:19:16,998
It's like... it's like...

366
00:19:16,999 --> 00:19:17,998
no, I mean,

367
00:19:17,999 --> 00:19:19,998
it's like a recordof a song.

368
00:19:19,999 --> 00:19:20,998
Where are yougonna buy a movie?

369
00:19:20,999 --> 00:19:21,998
You can buy them now.

370
00:19:21,999 --> 00:19:23,998
You can rent them.

371
00:19:23,999 --> 00:19:25,998
I really don't understandwhat
you're talking about.

372
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:27,998
It's in the future. It's coming.

373
00:19:27,999 --> 00:19:29,998
If I wanna watch t.V., then I watch t.V.

374
00:19:29,999 --> 00:19:31,998
If I wannago to the movies, then I do that.

375
00:19:31,999 --> 00:19:33,998
But thiscombines them both.

376
00:19:33,999 --> 00:19:35,999
Why? Why?

412
00:21:18,999 --> 00:21:20,998
What do you mean, like a
little movie projector?

413
00:21:20,999 --> 00:21:23,998
No. This is different.

414
00:21:23,999 --> 00:21:25,998

415
00:21:25,999 --> 00:21:27,998

00:21:29,999 --> 00:21:31,999
Hell, I don't knowwhat

Do you want some supper? Sure.

00:21:50,999 --> 00:21:51,998
Okay. Well, I'll come by,

429
00:21:55,999 --> 00:21:57,998
You complaining? No.

430
00:21:57,999 --> 00:22:00,998

433
00:22:06,999 --> 00:22:09,998
Oh, Mary Anne, I wouldn't go

434
00:22:09,999 --> 00:22:12,998
But why not?

435
00:22:12,999 --> 00:22:14,998
Oh, all right.

436
00:22:14,999 --> 00:22:16,998

437
00:22:16,999 --> 00:22:18,998
Let me look at you.

438
00:22:18,999 --> 00:22:21,998
You're fabulous. Yes.

439
00:22:21,999 --> 00:22:24,998
It looks good. Hello?

440
00:22:24,999 --> 00:22:27,998
Oh, dottie, hi. What...

441
00:22:27,999 --> 00:22:29,998
I don't understand.
Honey, what's the matter?

442
00:22:29,999 --> 00:22:31,998
You don't sound goodat all.

443
00:22:31,999 --> 00:22:34,998
Would you excuse mefor a minute?
It's my sister from Canada.

444
00:22:34,999 --> 00:22:36,998
She lives there, of all places.

445
00:22:36,999 --> 00:22:38,999
What is it, dottie? What?

446
00:22:40,999 --> 00:22:42,999
Oh, boy.

447
00:23:22,999 --> 00:23:25,998
Nipples.

448
00:23:25,999 --> 00:23:28,998
Lisa freelander. Lisa freelander?

449
00:23:28,999 --> 00:23:30,998
Nipples? You always saidshe had no nipples.

450
00:23:30,999 --> 00:23:33,998
Well, she had very, very
smallnipples, that's right.

451
00:23:33,999 --> 00:23:35,998
I said best nipplesof all time.

452
00:23:35,999 --> 00:23:37,998
But Lisa hadenormous tits.

453
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:39,998
I'm not talkingabout the whole tit.

454
00:23:39,999 --> 00:23:40,998
Well, something aboutthose enormous tits

455
00:23:40,999 --> 00:23:42,998
made those tiny nipplesvery special.

456
00:23:42,999 --> 00:23:44,998
Oh, I see.I understand.

457
00:23:44,999 --> 00:23:46,998
Now, those nipplesby themselves...

458
00:23:46,999 --> 00:23:48,998
no, I don't think they'd
doanything for you.

459
00:23:48,999 --> 00:23:51,998
But in context... world's best nipples.

460
00:23:51,999 --> 00:23:53,998
Right. Mm-hmm.

461
00:23:53,999 --> 00:23:54,998
Feet.

462
00:23:54,999 --> 00:23:55,999
Feet.

463
00:23:56,083 --> 00:23:58,998
Jennifer schneiderfrom law school.

464
00:23:58,999 --> 00:24:02,998
Small, beautifully done, immaculate feet.

465
00:24:02,999 --> 00:24:04,998
Great-looking toes.

466
00:24:04,999 --> 00:24:07,998
Nails polished just right.

467
00:24:07,999 --> 00:24:11,998
Oh, I used to beg herto walk
on my backwith those feet.

468
00:24:11,999 --> 00:24:16,999
Now, uh, tell meabout the girl you met.

469
00:24:17,999 --> 00:24:19,998
Well, it's the craziest thing.

470
00:24:19,999 --> 00:24:22,998
Her mother and my dadbeen
friends for years.

471
00:24:22,999 --> 00:24:24,998
But you never met?

472
00:24:24,999 --> 00:24:28,998
Well, once years and years
ago, but she doesn't remember.

473
00:24:28,999 --> 00:24:30,998
Just the one time?

474
00:24:30,999 --> 00:24:33,998
Guess I was awayor she was
awayor we were both away,

475
00:24:33,999 --> 00:24:34,998
but I never forgot her.

476
00:24:34,999 --> 00:24:37,998
Now you're both in townand you hook up.

477
00:24:37,999 --> 00:24:39,998
What'd you do?

478
00:24:39,999 --> 00:24:42,998
Well, I took her to lunch,
caught an afternoon movie.

479
00:24:42,999 --> 00:24:44,998
Touchy-feely.

480
00:24:44,999 --> 00:24:46,998
Of course, we got all worked up.

481
00:24:46,999 --> 00:24:49,998
Took her backto somebody's place?

482
00:24:49,999 --> 00:24:51,399
I took her home, and I dropped her.

483
00:24:52,999 --> 00:24:54,998
She shot you down?

484
00:24:54,999 --> 00:24:56,998
No, Eddie.

485
00:24:56,999 --> 00:24:59,998
I just didn't feellike
closing the deal yet.

486
00:24:59,999 --> 00:25:01,998
Well, why not?

487
00:25:01,999 --> 00:25:03,998
Oh, I guess the motherand
your father thing?

488
00:25:03,999 --> 00:25:05,998
Yeah, some of that.

489
00:25:05,999 --> 00:25:06,999
And I liked her.

490
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:08,998
You liked her?

491
00:25:08,999 --> 00:25:09,998
Yeah.

492
00:25:09,999 --> 00:25:11,998
So, show some respect.

493
00:25:11,999 --> 00:25:14,998
A little. Yeah.

494
00:25:14,999 --> 00:25:17,998
I see. I understand. Next time.

495
00:25:17,999 --> 00:25:20,998
Next time, maybe, yeah.

496
00:25:20,999 --> 00:25:23,998
Which is tonight, 'cause
I'm going over there.

497
00:25:23,999 --> 00:25:25,998
Not wasting any time.

498
00:25:25,999 --> 00:25:26,998
No.

499
00:25:26,999 --> 00:25:28,998
I understand.

500
00:25:28,999 --> 00:25:31,998
This time, she's had it.

501
00:25:31,999 --> 00:25:35,998
This time, she's gonna
getwhat's coming to her.

502
00:25:35,999 --> 00:25:37,998
Any potentialfor this one?

503
00:25:37,999 --> 00:25:39,998
Yes, lots of potential.

504
00:25:39,999 --> 00:25:42,998
For a body part award?

505
00:25:42,999 --> 00:25:45,998
Well, it's early yet, but I think so.

506
00:25:45,999 --> 00:25:47,998
What's her name?

507
00:25:47,999 --> 00:25:49,998
Katherine fritzsimmons.

508
00:25:49,999 --> 00:25:52,999
Don't know her. Good.

509
00:25:55,999 --> 00:25:58,999
**

510
00:26:00,999 --> 00:26:02,999
That didn't take long. No.

511
00:26:05,999 --> 00:26:06,998
What's the matter?

512
00:26:06,999 --> 00:26:09,042
Nothing.

513
00:26:09,999 --> 00:26:11,998
Something's the matter.

514
00:26:11,999 --> 00:26:14,998
Boy, can I just be readlike a book?

515
00:26:14,999 --> 00:26:16,998
Well, I can read you.

516
00:26:16,999 --> 00:26:20,998
You know, the motherof
this bride-to-be told me

517
00:26:20,999 --> 00:26:22,998
that her daughterhad not been promiscuous

518
00:26:22,999 --> 00:26:25,998
because men like girlswho are chaste.

519
00:26:25,999 --> 00:26:27,998
So, of course, I get this picture

520
00:26:27,999 --> 00:26:30,998
of this pack of roving men

521
00:26:30,999 --> 00:26:34,998
chasing this girlall over the place.

522
00:26:34,999 --> 00:26:37,998
"Chaste"... c-h-a-s-t-e.

523
00:26:37,999 --> 00:26:40,998
I know. It's c-h-a... I know.
I finally figured that out.

524
00:26:40,999 --> 00:26:42,998
And "bouillabaisse." Yeah, right.

525
00:26:42,999 --> 00:26:44,999
But you know mewith the words. Mm.

526
00:26:46,999 --> 00:26:48,998
Reece?

527
00:26:48,999 --> 00:26:50,999
Hmm?

528
00:26:52,999 --> 00:26:55,584
I got a phone callfrom
my sister up in Canada.

529
00:26:55,999 --> 00:26:58,998
And, well, her healthhas fallen to pieces,

530
00:26:58,999 --> 00:27:02,998
and she's... she's desperate.

531
00:27:02,999 --> 00:27:03,998
For what?

532
00:27:03,999 --> 00:27:07,998
For somebody.

533
00:27:07,999 --> 00:27:08,998
Who?

534
00:27:08,999 --> 00:27:10,998
Me.

535
00:27:10,999 --> 00:27:14,998
I'm the only personshe's got.

536
00:27:14,999 --> 00:27:16,998
Well, how sick is she?

537
00:27:16,999 --> 00:27:19,999
She's sick. She's very sick.

538
00:27:22,999 --> 00:27:24,998
So you might have Togo up there for awhile?

539
00:27:24,999 --> 00:27:28,998
I might have Togo up there to live.

540
00:27:28,999 --> 00:27:30,998
You mean forever?

541
00:27:30,999 --> 00:27:31,998
Well, she's notgonna live forever,

542
00:27:31,999 --> 00:27:35,998
but for as long as she does, she needs me.

543
00:27:35,999 --> 00:27:39,998
Wait. You're gonna moveup
to Canada to live?

544
00:27:39,999 --> 00:27:41,998

00:27:41,999 --> 00:27:44,998
Well, isn't there somebody
elsethat could be with her?

00:27:44,999 --> 00:27:47,998
I'm her only family. A friend or something?

547
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:49,600
She needs morethan a friend dropping by.

548
00:27:49,999 --> 00:27:50,998
She needs somebodyfull time.

549
00:27:50,999 --> 00:27:53,998
Well, she can't ask youto
change your whole life.

550
00:27:53,999 --> 00:27:57,998
She didn't come right outand ask me, but...

551
00:27:57,999 --> 00:27:59,998

552

602
00:30:14,999 --> 00:30:16,999
Joleen died.

603

She died yesterday at noon,

605
00:30:25,999 --> 00:30:27,999
straight up and down.

606
00:30:29,999 --> 00:30:30,998
How?

607
00:30:30,999 --> 00:30:32,998
Her heart.

608
00:30:32,999 --> 00:30:35,998
She had a defect in therefrom birth.

609
00:30:35,999 --> 00:30:37,998
Oh, Louis.

610
00:30:37,999 --> 00:30:40,999
I didn't know.

611
00:30:42,999 --> 00:30:44,998
Uh-huh.

612
00:30:44,999 --> 00:30:46,998
She diedat the ironing board.

613
00:30:46,999 --> 00:30:48,998
Ohh!

614
00:30:48,999 --> 00:30:51,998
She was ironing mea shirt.

615
00:30:51,999 --> 00:30:54,998
She just fell.

616
00:30:54,999 --> 00:30:56,998
Her heart stopped.

617
00:30:56,999 --> 00:30:59,998
Didn't make a big deal about it.
It just... quit.

618
00:30:59,999 --> 00:31:01,999
Oh, my God.

619
00:31:03,999 --> 00:31:05,998
You two are beingawfully kind to me.

620
00:31:05,999 --> 00:31:07,998
Well...

621
00:31:07,999 --> 00:31:09,998
Well, especially you, carol.

622
00:31:09,999 --> 00:31:12,998
I mean, after some of the
thingsjoleen said about you.

623
00:31:12,999 --> 00:31:14,998
What?

624
00:31:14,999 --> 00:31:16,998
Huh?

625
00:31:16,999 --> 00:31:18,998
Well, you know.

626
00:31:18,999 --> 00:31:20,999
No, I don't know.

627
00:31:22,999 --> 00:31:24,998
I'm sorry.

628
00:31:24,999 --> 00:31:27,998
I mean, I don't know whyshe
didn't care for you.

629
00:31:27,999 --> 00:31:30,998
She probably saw youwearing
a dress sometime

630
00:31:30,999 --> 00:31:32,998
that she thoughtwould look better on her.

631
00:31:32,999 --> 00:31:35,999
She didn't like me? I
mean, everybody likes me.

632
00:31:37,999 --> 00:31:39,999
I got a big mouth.

633
00:31:40,999 --> 00:31:42,999
Excuse me.

634
00:31:48,999 --> 00:31:52,998
Uh, another round, please. Thank you.

635
00:31:52,999 --> 00:31:54,998
I'm sorry that hurtyour feelings.

636
00:31:54,999 --> 00:31:56,998
Well, a personlikes to be liked.

637
00:31:56,999 --> 00:31:58,998
It's funny, isn't it? I mean,
we assumeeverybody likes us,

638
00:31:58,999 --> 00:32:00,998
but maybe they don't.

639
00:32:00,999 --> 00:32:02,998
Well, I like you.

640
00:32:02,999 --> 00:32:06,999
Please don't say thatto
me again, all right?

641
00:32:10,999 --> 00:32:13,998
Mmm.

642
00:32:13,999 --> 00:32:16,998
You remind meof Kenneth Meade.

643
00:32:16,999 --> 00:32:19,998
I don't know who that is.

644
00:32:19,999 --> 00:32:22,998
You don't know him.Why should you?

645
00:32:22,999 --> 00:32:25,999
He's a young man I dateda few
years backin San Francisco.

646
00:32:27,999 --> 00:32:30,998
Don't tell me I remind
youof some guy you dated.

647
00:32:30,999 --> 00:32:32,998
Why not? You do.

648
00:32:32,999 --> 00:32:34,998
Yeah, but don'ttell me I do.

649
00:32:34,999 --> 00:32:37,998
What, you wanna be uniquein all the world?

650
00:32:37,999 --> 00:32:41,998
Yes. What an insensitivething to do.

651
00:32:41,999 --> 00:32:43,998
Oh. I didn't realize.

652
00:32:43,999 --> 00:32:47,998
No? What if I told you

653
00:32:47,999 --> 00:32:50,998
you had lipslike Gretchen Miller?

654
00:32:50,999 --> 00:32:53,999
What if you did?

655
00:32:54,999 --> 00:32:56,999
How do I remind youof Kenneth?

656
00:32:57,999 --> 00:32:59,999
Forget it.

657
00:33:00,999 --> 00:33:03,626
How?

658
00:33:03,999 --> 00:33:05,998
You said you didn'twanna know.

659
00:33:05,999 --> 00:33:07,998
Well, is it the wayi look?

660
00:33:07,999 --> 00:33:09,998
No.

661
00:33:09,999 --> 00:33:12,998
Well, what then?

662
00:33:12,999 --> 00:33:15,998
I wonder what ever
happenedto Kenneth Meade.

663
00:33:15,999 --> 00:33:18,999
Was he a magnificent loveror something?

664
00:33:19,999 --> 00:33:22,999
I don't remember.

665
00:33:24,999 --> 00:33:26,999
All right.I'm gonna tell you.

666
00:33:27,999 --> 00:33:30,998
Sometimes,

667
00:33:30,999 --> 00:33:32,998
your eyes get really bigall of a sudden,

668
00:33:32,999 --> 00:33:34,998
and you swallow hard.

669
00:33:34,999 --> 00:33:36,998
Like a little boy.

670
00:33:36,999 --> 00:33:38,998
Like Kenneth.

671
00:33:38,999 --> 00:33:41,998
It's sort of likean involuntary expression

672
00:33:41,999 --> 00:33:43,998
of innocence.

673
00:33:43,999 --> 00:33:46,999
I like it.

674
00:33:47,999 --> 00:33:49,999
You have great ears.

675
00:33:51,999 --> 00:33:54,999
I do?

676
00:33:55,999 --> 00:33:57,998
They're beauties.

677
00:33:57,999 --> 00:33:59,998
Hmm.

678
00:33:59,999 --> 00:34:01,998
The greatest earsof all time?

679
00:34:01,999 --> 00:34:03,998
Huh?

680
00:34:03,999 --> 00:34:05,999
The greatest earsof all time?

681
00:34:07,999 --> 00:34:09,998
Why'd youask it like that?

682
00:34:09,999 --> 00:34:11,998
Why'd you usethose words?

683
00:34:11,999 --> 00:34:13,998
Like what? "The greatest earsof all time"?

684
00:34:13,999 --> 00:34:16,998
Oh. You thinki don't know how men talk?

685
00:34:16,999 --> 00:34:19,998
I think I do.

686
00:34:19,999 --> 00:34:21,998
Oh, my God, the things men say.

687
00:34:21,999 --> 00:34:23,998
They just kill me.

688
00:34:23,999 --> 00:34:27,998
They absolutely kill me.

689
00:34:27,999 --> 00:34:30,998
I'm right, aren't I?

690
00:34:30,999 --> 00:34:34,998
I can't tell you the detailsabout
her yet, Eddie.Why not?

691
00:34:34,999 --> 00:34:36,998
Well, what if she's the one?

692
00:34:36,999 --> 00:34:38,998
What does that mean? The one.

693
00:34:38,999 --> 00:34:41,998
What if she turns outto be the one for me?

694
00:34:41,999 --> 00:34:43,998
Oh, and then you told meall her secrets?

695
00:34:43,999 --> 00:34:45,998
That's right.And I wouldn't like that.

696
00:34:45,999 --> 00:34:48,998
I understand. But tell me anyway.

697
00:34:48,999 --> 00:34:50,998
What if it turned outi married her?

698
00:34:50,999 --> 00:34:52,998
Aw, don't even mentionthat word to me.

699
00:34:52,999 --> 00:34:54,998
Well, then you'd knowall
these secretsabout my wife.

700
00:34:54,999 --> 00:34:56,998
You met this girl24 hours ago.

701
00:34:56,999 --> 00:34:58,998
What the hell'sthe matter with you?

702
00:34:58,999 --> 00:35:01,998
I've been looking for herall my life.

703
00:35:01,999 --> 00:35:03,999
What has shedone to you?

704
00:35:04,999 --> 00:35:08,998
I think she'sthe end of the prey.

705
00:35:08,999 --> 00:35:11,999
Stop. Stop. I'm... I'm ill.

706
00:35:13,999 --> 00:35:15,998
All right.Just tell me...

707
00:35:15,999 --> 00:35:18,998

708
00:35:18,999 --> 00:35:20,998
between the naveland the pubes.

709
00:35:20,999 --> 00:35:23,998
Her tummy? Yeah. Below the tummy.

710
00:35:23,999 --> 00:35:26,999
Below the naval? But above the pubes.

711
00:35:28,999 --> 00:35:30,998
It's real white.

712
00:35:30,999 --> 00:35:32,998
Ooh.She got great skin.

713
00:35:32,999 --> 00:35:34,998
She must take afterher mother, I guess.

714
00:35:34,999 --> 00:35:37,998
Her mother's got great skin.
You leave the lights on?

715
00:35:37,999 --> 00:35:39,999
For awhile.

716
00:35:41,999 --> 00:35:43,998
So she's white, totally milky?

717
00:35:43,999 --> 00:35:45,998
No tan there at all?

718
00:35:45,999 --> 00:35:47,998
Not below the navel, above the pubes.

719
00:35:47,999 --> 00:35:50,998
Come on. Tell me more.

720
00:35:50,999 --> 00:35:52,999
No.

721
00:35:54,999 --> 00:35:56,999
Okay. Come on, chick!

722
00:36:04,999 --> 00:36:07,999
And to thinki called you friend once.

723
00:36:08,999 --> 00:36:11,998
How long have you knowncarol fritzsimmons?

724
00:36:11,999 --> 00:36:13,998
Oh, about 12 years, I guess.

725
00:36:13,999 --> 00:36:17,998
And in all that time, why didn't you
everintroduce me to her daughter?

726
00:36:17,999 --> 00:36:20,998
Why should I unleash
youon Carol's daughter?

727
00:36:20,999 --> 00:36:23,200
Well, we met yesterdayat the
markettotally by accident.

728
00:36:23,584 --> 00:36:25,998
Now, don't fool aroundwith
her daughter, all right?

729
00:36:25,999 --> 00:36:28,998
Why not? Because you go
through womenlike water,

730
00:36:28,999 --> 00:36:31,998
and I don't want youto
hurt her or her mother.

731
00:36:31,999 --> 00:36:33,998
Now, wait a minute. I'm not kidding.

732
00:36:33,999 --> 00:36:36,998
Hi, tom.

733
00:36:36,999 --> 00:36:39,998
Why haven't you everintroduced
your daughter to me?

734
00:36:39,999 --> 00:36:42,998
I don't know. They met
yesterdayby accident.

735
00:36:42,999 --> 00:36:44,998
Oh. Yeah, we went out.

736
00:36:44,999 --> 00:36:46,998
I really like Katherine. Uh...

737
00:36:46,999 --> 00:36:49,998
you went out already? Yeah,
we had a couple dates.

738
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:52,998
What do you mean? You just met her
yesterday, and you already had two dates?

739
00:36:52,999 --> 00:36:55,998
Yeah. I took herto the
moviesyesterday afternoon.

740
00:36:55,999 --> 00:36:57,998
Then we got togetheragain last night.

741
00:36:57,999 --> 00:36:59,998
You took her to the
moviesyesterday afternoon?

742
00:36:59,999 --> 00:37:01,999
Yeah.

743
00:37:03,876 --> 00:37:04,999
Oh, come on. What?

744
00:37:05,959 --> 00:37:07,998
Okay, wait a minute. What did you see?

745
00:37:07,999 --> 00:37:09,998
Well, we saw that thingover
at the Baker.Oh, my God.

746
00:37:09,999 --> 00:37:11,998
Yesterday afternoon? Yeah.

747
00:37:11,999 --> 00:37:15,000
Were you sittingdown there
in front, on the left there?

748
00:37:15,999 --> 00:37:19,998
Now, don't lie to me. There was
only four peoplein the theater.

749
00:37:19,999 --> 00:37:21,998
We... we thoughtwe... we were alone.

750
00:37:21,999 --> 00:37:23,998
Well, that wasgrossly apparent.

751
00:37:23,999 --> 00:37:25,999
Uh-huh.

752
00:37:32,999 --> 00:37:34,998
Why can't your sistermove down here?

753
00:37:34,999 --> 00:37:37,998
Because she can't, reece.Why not?

754
00:37:37,999 --> 00:37:41,999
Because she's dying, and I don't want
to put herthrough that kind of ordeal.

755
00:37:44,999 --> 00:37:46,998
How longhas she got, Carol?

756
00:37:46,999 --> 00:37:48,998
How long does anybody have? I don't know.

757
00:37:48,999 --> 00:37:51,998
All I know is I'm healthyand she's not,

758
00:37:51,999 --> 00:37:53,999
and she should bewhere she wants to be.

759
00:37:54,209 --> 00:37:57,334
Besides, I ordered herto come down here,

760
00:37:57,999 --> 00:38:00,998
and she said no.

761
00:38:00,999 --> 00:38:04,998
Well, I just thoughtmaybe
you hadn't thought of it.

762
00:38:04,999 --> 00:38:07,998
Did you drive all the wayover
here at 10:30 at night

763
00:38:07,999 --> 00:38:09,999
to ask me that?

764
00:38:10,876 --> 00:38:12,998
Well, what if wehired a nurse, okay?

765
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:14,998
And she could stay herewith her all day

766
00:38:14,999 --> 00:38:18,998
and all nightand holidays.

767
00:38:18,999 --> 00:38:21,999
I know it'd be expensive,
but I'll pay for it.

768
00:38:22,999 --> 00:38:25,998
You'd do that for her?

769
00:38:25,999 --> 00:38:30,999
Well, I'd do thatfor you and... and me.

770
00:38:32,999 --> 00:38:36,998
So... I don't know.

771
00:38:36,999 --> 00:38:40,998
Look, I don't know how manymore
ideas I can come up with.

772
00:38:40,999 --> 00:38:42,999
Yeah.

773
00:38:44,999 --> 00:38:47,999
Were you sleeping? Mm, watching t.V.

774
00:38:49,999 --> 00:38:51,998
What's wrong? Nothing.

775
00:38:51,999 --> 00:38:56,998
Well, good night.

776
00:38:56,999 --> 00:38:58,999
The late show is on at 11:00.

777
00:38:59,999 --> 00:39:00,999
You gonna watch it?

778
00:39:02,999 --> 00:39:06,998
**

779
00:39:06,999 --> 00:39:09,998
Now, see, this is a movie,

780
00:39:09,999 --> 00:39:11,998
but we're watching t. V.Not... reece...

781
00:39:11,999 --> 00:39:13,998
yeah, like that machinei showed you.

782
00:39:13,999 --> 00:39:15,998
Movies should be seenin the movie theaters,

783
00:39:15,999 --> 00:39:18,998
where the screen is big, there's no
ads, you have aisles and ushers,

784
00:39:18,999 --> 00:39:21,998
and that's my opinion.

785
00:39:21,999 --> 00:39:23,999
Can't you see that? I finally thought...

786
00:39:25,999 --> 00:39:27,998
Reece? You're right.

787
00:39:27,999 --> 00:39:29,998
Reece? Huh?

788
00:39:29,999 --> 00:39:32,998
How badly do you notwant me to move?

789
00:39:32,999 --> 00:39:34,999
Well, you could leavetonight if you want.

790
00:39:38,375 --> 00:39:39,998
Do you know somethingi'd always regret?

791
00:39:39,999 --> 00:39:43,998
What? That...

792
00:39:43,999 --> 00:39:46,998
that we neverwent away together.
Do you know?

793
00:39:46,999 --> 00:39:48,998
You mean on vacation, or what?

794
00:39:48,999 --> 00:39:51,918
Oh, a weekend.A long weekend away.

795
00:39:51,999 --> 00:39:54,998
We never did that. No, thanks.

796
00:39:54,999 --> 00:39:56,998
Well, how come you
nevermentioned this before?

797
00:39:56,999 --> 00:39:59,998
Why didn't you? I'm not a traveler.

798
00:39:59,999 --> 00:40:02,998
Well, I didn't knowhow to mention it.

799
00:40:02,999 --> 00:40:06,998
How difficultcould it have been?

800
00:40:06,999 --> 00:40:08,250
Very.

801
00:40:08,999 --> 00:40:10,998
Don't sing that, please.

802
00:40:10,999 --> 00:40:14,501
You know what I would liketo see one
of these daysis a good old Western.

803
00:40:14,999 --> 00:40:15,998
Oh, yeah. They're not makingthose anymore.

804
00:40:15,999 --> 00:40:17,998
I'd love to see a Western.They're not.

805
00:40:17,999 --> 00:40:18,998
I know. You know, like, uh,

806
00:40:18,999 --> 00:40:20,998
the outlaw Josey wales a couple years ago.

807
00:40:20,999 --> 00:40:23,998
You see yourselfas a bit of an outlaw.

808
00:40:23,999 --> 00:40:26,998
What? Yeah, you see yourselfas
a bit of an outlaw.

809
00:40:26,999 --> 00:40:29,998
I have no ideawhat you mean by that.

810
00:40:29,999 --> 00:40:31,998
Oh, the renegade.

811
00:40:31,999 --> 00:40:34,998
Yeah, and the personwho doesn't do
thingslike the way they're done.

812
00:40:34,999 --> 00:40:36,998
I'm a solid citizen.What do you mean?

813
00:40:36,999 --> 00:40:40,998
Okay. Most menget up in the morning,

814
00:40:40,999 --> 00:40:42,998
they go to work at a job,

815
00:40:42,999 --> 00:40:44,998
and 5:00... yeah?

816
00:40:44,999 --> 00:40:46,998
...they go home.

817
00:40:46,999 --> 00:40:47,998
You've never done that, reece.

818
00:40:47,999 --> 00:40:50,999
I've got the store.That store is a toy.

819
00:40:53,999 --> 00:40:55,999
Oh, I know. Butch Cassidy
and the Sundance kid.

820
00:40:57,999 --> 00:41:00,998
You know the one.Where
they jump off the cliff.

821
00:41:00,999 --> 00:41:01,998
And they say, "oh, shit."

822
00:41:01,999 --> 00:41:03,998
Shit!

823
00:41:03,999 --> 00:41:05,998
Shit. It's too embarrassing.

824
00:41:05,999 --> 00:41:07,999
It's kind of embarrassing, but we're alone.

825
00:41:19,999 --> 00:41:21,998
So what do you think?

826
00:41:21,999 --> 00:41:23,998
I don't know.

827
00:41:23,999 --> 00:41:27,998
I bet they're togethersomewhere,
those two. Hmm.

828
00:41:27,999 --> 00:41:29,998
Maybe.

829
00:41:29,999 --> 00:41:31,998
It's not movie day.

830
00:41:31,999 --> 00:41:33,998
They'll be backin awhile, I guess.

831
00:41:33,999 --> 00:41:36,998
I wouldn't worry.

832
00:41:36,999 --> 00:41:38,998
This place is amazing.

833
00:41:38,999 --> 00:41:43,998
You see anything you like? Everything.

834
00:41:43,999 --> 00:41:45,998
You neverbeen in here before?

835
00:41:45,999 --> 00:41:49,998
No. I've only driven by.

836
00:41:49,999 --> 00:41:51,998
Well, you should'vecome by years ago.

837
00:41:51,999 --> 00:41:53,998
I might've been here.

838
00:41:53,999 --> 00:41:55,999
I never knewit was such a candy box.

839
00:41:57,999 --> 00:42:00,999
My mother never told
memuch about this place.

840
00:42:01,999 --> 00:42:03,999
Wow.

841
00:42:08,999 --> 00:42:11,998
Our parents must be in
love, don't you think?

842
00:42:11,999 --> 00:42:14,998
Mm. I'm not sure.

843
00:42:14,999 --> 00:42:17,998
Besides, my dadwould never use that word.

844
00:42:17,999 --> 00:42:20,998
Well, did he use itwith your mother?

845
00:42:20,999 --> 00:42:21,999
I don't know. I doubt it.

846
00:42:23,999 --> 00:42:26,998
I can't believeshe might go to Toronto.

847
00:42:26,999 --> 00:42:28,998
She might neversee him again.

848
00:42:28,999 --> 00:42:31,998
And if she were to go, you
know what the reason is?

849
00:42:31,999 --> 00:42:33,998
Her sister.

850
00:42:33,999 --> 00:42:35,999
Yeah. But not only that.

851
00:42:38,999 --> 00:42:41,998
She's testing him.

852
00:42:41,999 --> 00:42:44,998
She's testingtheir relationship.

853
00:42:44,999 --> 00:42:47,999
That'd bea dangerous thing to do.

854
00:42:57,999 --> 00:42:59,999
I wanna watch youundress and dress.

855
00:43:02,999 --> 00:43:04,998
Pervert.

856
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:07,998
You can make mea pervert.

857
00:43:07,999 --> 00:43:10,999
That's a lovely thingto say.

858
00:43:15,999 --> 00:43:17,999
Hello, Louis.

859
00:43:19,999 --> 00:43:21,998

860
00:43:21,999 --> 00:43:23,998
Uh, he's not here today.

861
00:43:23,999 --> 00:43:25,999
Or he's gone. We're not sure.

862
00:43:30,999 --> 00:43:32,998

863
00:43:32,999 --> 00:43:34,999

Uh, it's a dress.

Why you wearing it?

872
00:44:06,999 --> 00:44:10,998
Well, usually, it's easier to meet
someonewhen you have clothes on.

873
00:44:10,999 --> 00:44:12,999
Get that dress off! Aahh!

874
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:17,999

00:45:20,999 --> 00:45:23,998
Ducks?

894
00:45:23,999 --> 00:45:26,998
Wait. Let me get this.

895
00:45:26,999 --> 00:45:30,998
Okay.

896
00:45:30,999 --> 00:45:33,998
Hey, what are you doing? Quit. What?

897
00:45:33,999 --> 00:45:35,998
What?

898
00:45:35,999 --> 00:45:36,998
I've never hadmy picture taken.

899
00:45:36,999 --> 00:45:38,125
What are youtalking about?

900
00:45:38,999 --> 00:45:40,998
I've never hadany pictures taken of me.

901
00:45:40,999 --> 00:45:43,334
Since when? Ever.

902
00:45:43,999 --> 00:45:45,998
I don't understand. What
kind of a lieis that anyway?

903
00:45:45,999 --> 00:45:48,998
No, no. I'm not kidding
you.I've never had a picture.

904
00:45:48,999 --> 00:45:50,999
What aboutyour family album?

905
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:53,998
There is no family album.

906
00:45:53,999 --> 00:45:55,998
Okay, well, then, you
were in the army. Yeah.

907
00:45:55,999 --> 00:45:57,998
Three years in the pacific.

908
00:45:57,999 --> 00:46:00,998
So, they took your picturein
the army, didn't they?

909
00:46:00,999 --> 00:46:02,998
No. They missed me.

910
00:46:02,999 --> 00:46:05,998
Reece, you're pullingmy leg, huh? Uh-uh.

911
00:46:05,999 --> 00:46:08,998
Well, then, what didyou look like,
reece, when you were a little boy?

912
00:46:08,999 --> 00:46:11,998
I don't know. I've got no idea.

913
00:46:11,999 --> 00:46:14,998
I don't care. I'm doing it. No. Come on.

914
00:46:14,999 --> 00:46:16,998
No. Quit it now.Cut it out.No, wait.

915
00:46:16,999 --> 00:46:18,375
Please, let me justtake one. No.

916
00:46:18,999 --> 00:46:19,998
Reece... no, please. No.

917
00:46:19,999 --> 00:46:21,998
I'm gonna get a pictureof you. I am. No.

918
00:46:21,999 --> 00:46:24,998
I am. What if we separateor
something happens to us?

919
00:46:24,999 --> 00:46:27,998
I'm gonna have a picturewhere
I can look back on.

920
00:46:27,999 --> 00:46:30,999
You don't need it. Yes, I do. I need it.

921
00:46:37,999 --> 00:46:40,998
Hey, Alpha! Zeus!

922
00:46:40,999 --> 00:46:41,998
Come on, Zeus!

923
00:46:41,999 --> 00:46:44,999
She here? Yeah, she's inside there.

924
00:46:46,999 --> 00:46:49,998
Amanda McKay?

925
00:46:49,999 --> 00:46:50,998
No.

926
00:46:50,999 --> 00:46:52,998
Louise Duffy?

927
00:46:52,999 --> 00:46:54,998
No.

928
00:46:54,999 --> 00:46:57,998
Well, who do you knowaround here?

929
00:46:57,999 --> 00:47:00,999
Well, I don't remembernames much.

930
00:47:02,999 --> 00:47:04,998
Yeah.

931
00:47:04,999 --> 00:47:07,998
Now, Katherine...

932
00:47:07,999 --> 00:47:09,998
Tom herethinks he likes you.

933
00:47:09,999 --> 00:47:12,998
And that's all welland good.

934
00:47:12,999 --> 00:47:16,998
But it's my jobto make sure

935
00:47:16,999 --> 00:47:19,998
that if he likes you, he
knows what he's doing.

936
00:47:19,999 --> 00:47:21,998
I understand. Do you?

937
00:47:21,999 --> 00:47:23,999
I think I do.

938
00:47:25,999 --> 00:47:26,999
You think you do?

939
00:47:28,542 --> 00:47:29,998
See,

940
00:47:29,999 --> 00:47:33,998
tom and I know women.

941
00:47:33,999 --> 00:47:36,998
You know what I mean? It's what we do.

942
00:47:36,999 --> 00:47:38,998
I can see this situation

943
00:47:38,999 --> 00:47:40,998
so much more clearlythan he can.

944
00:47:40,999 --> 00:47:42,998
Look, if you and ihad a thing,

945
00:47:42,999 --> 00:47:44,998
he would be the oneasking the questions.

946
00:47:44,999 --> 00:47:46,998
Well, of course. See,

947
00:47:46,999 --> 00:47:48,998
what I'm looking for

948
00:47:48,999 --> 00:47:50,998
is an ulterior motive.

949
00:47:50,999 --> 00:47:53,998
I don't have any motives,
ulterior or otherwise.

950
00:47:53,999 --> 00:47:56,999
Well, what the hellyou doing here?

951
00:47:57,999 --> 00:47:59,999
I'm just alongfor the ride.

952
00:48:01,999 --> 00:48:04,998
Is it your planto cut tom
off from other women,

953
00:48:04,999 --> 00:48:06,998
and by doing so, sabotage our friendship?

954
00:48:06,999 --> 00:48:08,998
No.

955
00:48:08,999 --> 00:48:11,998
This manwas once a marine.

956
00:48:11,999 --> 00:48:14,999
He fought gooksin the jungle.

957
00:48:16,999 --> 00:48:18,998
You care to comment on that?

958
00:48:18,999 --> 00:48:20,999
No, I'd rather not.

959
00:48:23,999 --> 00:48:25,998
Miss, uh...

960
00:48:25,999 --> 00:48:26,998
fritzsimmons.

961
00:48:26,999 --> 00:48:29,998
Fritzsimmons.

962
00:48:29,999 --> 00:48:33,998
Is there a specificpart of your body

963
00:48:33,999 --> 00:48:36,999
that is perhapsthe greatest of its kind?

964
00:48:39,999 --> 00:48:40,999
My ears.

965
00:48:42,999 --> 00:48:44,998
May I see them?

966
00:48:44,999 --> 00:48:46,999
All right.

967
00:49:02,999 --> 00:49:04,999
I haveno further questions.

968
00:49:51,999 --> 00:49:52,998
How do you work this? No. Here. Lookit...

969
00:49:52,999 --> 00:49:54,998
no.

970
00:49:54,999 --> 00:49:56,998
Here. Let me get youcoming off the canyon.

971
00:49:56,999 --> 00:49:58,998
Come on. No, I don't wanna.

972
00:49:58,999 --> 00:50:00,998
Such a cute hat.

973
00:50:00,999 --> 00:50:02,998
Every age I hit

974
00:50:02,999 --> 00:50:05,998
seems youngerthan it did before.

975
00:50:05,999 --> 00:50:07,998
I'm 54.So I remember

976
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:10,998
when I was 20, 30,god, even 40,

977
00:50:10,999 --> 00:50:13,998
I thought 54was really ancient.

978
00:50:13,999 --> 00:50:15,998
54's not that old.No, no.

979
00:50:15,999 --> 00:50:17,998
It doesn'tseem like it's
old, but it actually is.

980
00:50:17,999 --> 00:50:19,998
I mean, I knowwhat you're talking about.

981
00:50:19,999 --> 00:50:21,998
But it's old, and you know it.

982
00:50:21,999 --> 00:50:24,998
I rememberwhen I was 35,

983
00:50:24,999 --> 00:50:26,998
I really pitiedthose poor
old peoplewho were 40.

984
00:50:26,999 --> 00:50:31,998
But when I was 45,I would've
killedto have been 40.

985
00:50:31,999 --> 00:50:33,998
40?Mm-hmm.You're 56, right?

986
00:50:33,999 --> 00:50:36,998
So wouldn't it be greatto be 45?

987
00:50:36,999 --> 00:50:38,999
Well... it would.

988
00:50:40,999 --> 00:50:42,998
Are you bushed?

989
00:50:42,999 --> 00:50:44,998
No. I'm fine. No?

990
00:50:44,999 --> 00:50:45,998
You didn't sleep muchlast night.

991
00:50:45,999 --> 00:50:47,999
Neither did you.

992
00:50:49,999 --> 00:50:51,998
What does that mean?

993
00:50:51,999 --> 00:50:54,999
Look at this. Oh, my God!

994
00:51:01,999 --> 00:51:03,998
Oh!

995
00:51:03,999 --> 00:51:06,998
Please don't.Oh, reece, don't. Don't.

996
00:51:06,999 --> 00:51:08,998
Get away from there.I'm all right.
It's kindof thrilling, actually.

997
00:51:08,999 --> 00:51:10,998
Whoa.

998
00:51:10,999 --> 00:51:13,999
Aahh! Oh. Oh. Better hold me. Come here.

999
00:51:19,999 --> 00:51:22,998
Don't do that. Don't do that.

1000
00:51:22,999 --> 00:51:24,998
You know what?

1001
00:51:24,999 --> 00:51:27,998
You're the only thrilli need. Mm.

1002
00:51:27,999 --> 00:51:28,999
You are.

1003
00:51:30,999 --> 00:51:33,998
You two! What?

1004
00:51:33,999 --> 00:51:34,998
Louis!

1005
00:51:34,999 --> 00:51:37,998
You two can be hard to
findwhen you wanna be.

1006
00:51:37,999 --> 00:51:39,998
Louis, what's the problem?

1007
00:51:39,999 --> 00:51:42,998
I tracked you down.

1008
00:51:42,999 --> 00:51:44,998
Huh?

1009
00:51:44,999 --> 00:51:47,998
Lou, what the hellare you doing up here?

1010
00:51:47,999 --> 00:51:49,999
Ohh!

1011
00:51:52,999 --> 00:51:54,998
Louis, get away from there!
Come on, Louis. Don't.

1012
00:51:54,999 --> 00:51:57,998
I'm not gonna jump. No, but you could fall.

1013
00:51:57,999 --> 00:51:58,998
Louis!

1014
00:51:58,999 --> 00:52:00,998
Lou, come on.

1015
00:52:00,999 --> 00:52:01,999
Aahh!

1016
00:52:04,999 --> 00:52:06,998
You know, I heardby the year 2040,

1017
00:52:06,999 --> 00:52:09,998
there's not gonna bea single
tree lefton this planet.

1018
00:52:09,999 --> 00:52:14,998
Lou... I wonder what peopleare
gonna do without trees.

1019
00:52:14,999 --> 00:52:16,998
Lou, what did youcome up here for?
Yeah, Louis.

1020
00:52:16,999 --> 00:52:17,998
Get away from there.Come on.

1021
00:52:17,999 --> 00:52:20,999
Come on.

1022
00:52:23,999 --> 00:52:26,999
Why'd you do it, reece?

1023
00:52:27,999 --> 00:52:29,998
Do what?

1024
00:52:29,999 --> 00:52:32,998
I was looking throughsome
of joleen's things.

1025
00:52:32,999 --> 00:52:33,998
I found this.

1026
00:52:33,999 --> 00:52:35,998
What is it?

1027
00:52:35,999 --> 00:52:39,998
It's a letter she wrote, never mailed.

1028
00:52:39,999 --> 00:52:42,998
Look, Lou, come on awayfrom
the edge there, would you?

1029
00:52:42,999 --> 00:52:44,999
I'll read youthe letter.

1030
00:52:45,999 --> 00:52:47,999
Lou...

1031
00:52:49,999 --> 00:52:52,998
"Dearest reece,

1032
00:52:52,999 --> 00:52:54,998
"as long as I live,

1033
00:52:54,999 --> 00:52:56,998
I will never forgetwhat
you have done for me."

1034
00:52:56,999 --> 00:52:58,998
Lou, would you please... "I was yours.

1035
00:52:58,999 --> 00:53:02,999
"I came to you.I wanted you. I was yours.

1036
00:53:04,999 --> 00:53:07,998
"But you said no,

1037
00:53:07,999 --> 00:53:10,998
"you would not have me.

1038
00:53:10,999 --> 00:53:13,998
"Not even for one night.

1039
00:53:13,999 --> 00:53:17,998
"In your kind rejection, yet understanding,

1040
00:53:17,999 --> 00:53:19,999
"you have taught me honor.

1041
00:53:21,999 --> 00:53:23,998
"Thank you, reece.

1042
00:53:23,999 --> 00:53:27,999
Love, joleen."

1043
00:53:28,999 --> 00:53:32,998
Like I said, why'd you do it, reece?

1044
00:53:32,999 --> 00:53:35,998
There were many timesyears back

1045
00:53:35,999 --> 00:53:37,998
when I thoughtshe was fooling around on me,

1046
00:53:37,999 --> 00:53:41,999
but I never knew for surewho with.

1047
00:53:45,999 --> 00:53:48,999
This letter clears you, of course.

1048
00:53:49,999 --> 00:53:50,999
Doesn't it?

1049
00:54:06,999 --> 00:54:08,999
I owe you.

1050
00:54:15,999 --> 00:54:17,999
Lou...

1051
00:54:20,999 --> 00:54:22,999
I'm selling my house, reece.

1052
00:54:27,999 --> 00:54:29,999
I'm going to my sister's.

1053
00:54:43,999 --> 00:54:44,499
**

1054
00:54:48,999 --> 00:54:51,998
I'm dancing with her.No,
I'm dancing with her.

1055
00:54:51,999 --> 00:54:55,998
Hey, isn't thisa little unethical,
Eddie... you and Lola being here?

1056
00:54:55,999 --> 00:54:58,998
What wouldn't be ethicalabout it?
Hi. How are you?

1057
00:54:58,999 --> 00:55:02,998
Well, the obvious. I mean, you represent
her in divorce, and now here you are.

1058
00:55:02,999 --> 00:55:04,998
Yeah, but divorceis final and everything.

1059
00:55:04,999 --> 00:55:06,998
Tom, because I choosea certain profession,

1060
00:55:06,999 --> 00:55:10,998
certain people are
suddenlyoff-limits to me in life?

1061
00:55:10,999 --> 00:55:13,998
I hope that is not howour
judicial system works.

1062
00:55:13,999 --> 00:55:15,998
Listen, I wouldn't, like,
have gone out with him

1063
00:55:15,999 --> 00:55:17,998
while the casewas still in progress.

1064
00:55:17,999 --> 00:55:19,998
Of course not.I can see how

1065
00:55:19,999 --> 00:55:21,998
certainsmall-minded individuals

1066
00:55:21,999 --> 00:55:24,998
could misconstrue.

1067
00:55:24,999 --> 00:55:26,998
Except that one timeand everything.

1068
00:55:26,999 --> 00:55:28,998
What time was that, Lola?

1069
00:55:28,999 --> 00:55:30,998
Should I tell them?

1070
00:55:30,999 --> 00:55:31,998
Admit nothing.

1071
00:55:31,999 --> 00:55:33,998

1083
00:56:08,999 --> 00:56:11,998

1084
00:56:11,999 --> 00:56:13,998

1085
00:56:13,999 --> 00:56:16,998
* I said pour me another one, I'm
finished with the other one *

1086
00:56:16,999 --> 00:56:19,998

1087
00:56:19,999 --> 00:56:22,519

finished with the other one *

1088
00:56:22,999 --> 00:56:24,999

1089
00:56:28,999 --> 00:56:29,999

1248
01:04:36,999 --> 01:04:38,998
You should let meget somebody in here

1249
01:04:38,999 --> 01:04:40,999
to cleanthis place up.

1250
01:04:42,999 --> 01:04:44,998
Well, Ruth wasmy housekeeper.

1251
01:04:44,999 --> 01:04:46,998
Yeah, well... Ruth's long gone, dad.

1252
01:04:46,999 --> 01:04:48,999
Besides, she'dhave a fit at this mess.

1253
01:04:50,999 --> 01:04:51,998
Would you liketo go out

1254
01:04:51,999 --> 01:04:53,999
to the hill country, dad?
And spend the night?

1255
01:04:54,999 --> 01:04:55,998

1256
01:04:55,999 --> 01:04:57,998
You used to liketo go out there,

1257
01:04:57,999 --> 01:04:59,998
and you haven't beenout there in years.

1258
01:04:59,999 --> 01:05:02,998
I don't careanything about it.

1259
01:05:02,999 --> 01:05:04,998
I'd like to see youget out of this store

1260
01:05:04,999 --> 01:05:05,998

1261
01:05:05,999 --> 01:05:07,998
Why?

1262
01:05:07,999 --> 01:05:08,998
You've gottenso damn sedentary, dad.

1263
01:05:08,999 --> 01:05:10,998
There's nowhere to go.

1264
01:05:10,999 --> 01:05:11,998
Well, there's lotsof places to go

1265
01:05:11,999 --> 01:05:13,998

1266
01:05:13,999 --> 01:05:16,999
I don't careanything about it.

1267
01:05:21,999 --> 01:05:24,998
You know, I'm not sure, but I

1268
01:05:24,999 --> 01:05:27,998

1269
01:05:27,999 --> 01:05:29,999
You remember her?

1270
01:05:33,999 --> 01:05:34,998
Little bit.

1271
01:05:34,999 --> 01:05:38,998
At least I believeit was her.

1272
01:05:38,999 --> 01:05:41,999
Wonder what in the worldmight
bring her back to town.

1273
01:05:50,999 --> 01:05:53,999
Hello?

Yeah, she did.She moved to Canada.

1280
01:06:20,999 --> 01:06:22,998
Mm-hmm. Mm.

1281
01:06:22,999 --> 01:06:23,998

Apparently so.

1283
01:06:25,999 --> 01:06:28,998

years just like clockwork.

1301
01:07:54,999 --> 01:07:57,998
What'll you have?

1302
01:07:57,999 --> 01:08:00,998

01:08:12,999 --> 01:08:15,998
I've been reading abouthow
to write a mystery novel.

1308
01:08:15,999 --> 01:08:18,998
Why?

1309
01:08:18,999 --> 01:08:20,998
Oh, I don't know. I thought that I

1310
01:08:20,999 --> 01:08:23,998
might try and write one.

1311
01:08:23,999 --> 01:08:25,998
Agatha christie? Oh, well, she wrote 200.

1312
01:08:25,999 --> 01:08:28,999
I might write one.

1313
01:08:30,999 --> 01:08:33,998
You still sew? Sure.

1314
01:08:33,999 --> 01:08:35,998
So you're gonnawrite a mystery and sew?

1315
01:08:35,999 --> 01:08:38,998
Well, I like to keep busy, don't you?

1316
01:08:38,999 --> 01:08:40,998
No, no. I don't like to keep busy.

1317
01:08:40,999 --> 01:08:43,999
I like to hardly do anything. Thank you.

1318
01:08:46,999 --> 01:08:48,999

Huh. You still goto the movies?

1322
01:08:59,999 --> 01:09:02,998
Mm. Hardly ever.

1323
01:09:02,999 --> 01:09:05,998
I watch them on tapes.

1324
01:09:05,999 --> 01:09:06,998
Huh.

He brings me bagsfull of tapes.

1328
01:09:13,999 --> 01:09:17,998
Well, that's convenient.
So you watch them at home?

1329
01:09:17,999 --> 01:09:18,998
No, at the store.

1330
01:09:18,999 --> 01:09:21,998
I don't go home much. The store is home.

1331
01:09:21,999 --> 01:09:24,998
I spend mostof the time there.At the store.

1332
01:09:24,999 --> 01:09:26,998
Yeah. More comfortable.lt's smaller.

1333
01:09:26,999 --> 01:09:29,998
I like a smaller placeto live in, you know.

1334
01:09:29,999 --> 01:09:31,998
You still dogood business?

1335
01:09:31,999 --> 01:09:33,998
No, no. I'd be lyingif I said I did.

1336
01:09:33,999 --> 01:09:35,998
It's slacked off some.
Really?'Cause I would've thought

1337
01:09:35,999 --> 01:09:38,998
that the used clothingpart of your
businesswould've skyrocketed.

1338
01:09:38,999 --> 01:09:39,998
Why is that?

1339
01:09:39,999 --> 01:09:42,998
'Cause the times.

1340
01:09:42,999 --> 01:09:44,998
I mean, you know, used
clothesare really popular.

1341
01:09:44,999 --> 01:09:47,999
New clothes havethese holes in them.

1342
01:09:49,999 --> 01:09:51,998
Well, you can't leta business go,

1343
01:09:51,999 --> 01:09:54,999
and I kind of let mine
goover the millennium.

1344
01:09:56,999 --> 01:09:58,998
Yeah.

1345
01:09:58,999 --> 01:10:00,998
Oh, boy.

1346
01:10:00,999 --> 01:10:03,998
Reece.

1347
01:10:03,999 --> 01:10:05,998
When I first met you, you drove a Cadillac.

1348
01:10:05,999 --> 01:10:06,998
Yeah. Yeah.

1349
01:10:06,999 --> 01:10:09,998
You were really expansive. Yeah.

1350
01:10:09,999 --> 01:10:11,999
By the time I moved, you'd gotten smaller.

1351
01:10:13,999 --> 01:10:17,998
Well, I only likedbeing around the store

1352
01:10:17,999 --> 01:10:20,998
'cause that's whereyou were, you know.

1353
01:10:20,999 --> 01:10:23,998
Me? I somewhat scaled down.

1354
01:10:23,999 --> 01:10:25,999
So now you're smaller still.I'm tiny now.

1355
01:10:27,999 --> 01:10:29,999
I got ridof almost everything.

1356
01:10:31,999 --> 01:10:34,998
So, how long do you think

1357
01:10:34,999 --> 01:10:36,999
you're gonna livein that hotel?

1358
01:10:40,999 --> 01:10:43,999
Well, until I can findthe
right apartment to buy.

1359
01:10:45,999 --> 01:10:47,998
Well, maybe I can help
youlook for an apartment.

1360
01:10:47,999 --> 01:10:49,999
I'd like that. Yeah.

1361
01:10:50,999 --> 01:10:52,998
You still knowjust about everyone there is?

1362
01:10:52,999 --> 01:10:54,999
No. Hardly anybody.

1363
01:11:00,999 --> 01:11:03,998
Your, uh, sister

1364
01:11:03,999 --> 01:11:05,999
hung on a long time, didn't she?

1365
01:11:08,999 --> 01:11:11,999
Well, not as long as some.

1366
01:11:12,999 --> 01:11:15,998
You gave up a lot for her.

1367
01:11:15,999 --> 01:11:19,334
I didn't really feelas
though I had a choice.

1368
01:11:21,999 --> 01:11:23,999
You're a very good person.

1369
01:11:33,999 --> 01:11:36,998
Tell me something.How was Tennessee?

1370
01:11:36,999 --> 01:11:40,998
Tennessee? Yeah. The play.

1371
01:11:40,999 --> 01:11:42,998
I don't knowwhat you're talking about.

1372
01:11:42,999 --> 01:11:44,998
Well, the last time I saw
you, you were getting ready

1373
01:11:44,999 --> 01:11:46,998
to go to tennesseeand act in a play.

1374
01:11:46,999 --> 01:11:48,998
Oh, okay.

1375
01:11:48,999 --> 01:11:50,998
Yeah, I remember.

1376
01:11:50,999 --> 01:11:52,998
Every timei thought of Tennessee,

1377
01:11:52,999 --> 01:11:54,998
I mean, over the years,

1378
01:11:54,999 --> 01:11:56,998
I would think of you.

1379
01:11:56,999 --> 01:11:59,998
I was Tennessee to you?

1380
01:11:59,999 --> 01:12:01,998
That's funny.

1381
01:12:01,999 --> 01:12:03,998
Nah, I was only therefive minutes.

1382
01:12:03,999 --> 01:12:06,998
Five minutes?

1383
01:12:06,999 --> 01:12:08,998
Well, yeah. I got up there, and, uh,

1384
01:12:08,999 --> 01:12:10,998
the theater went broke, something.

1385
01:12:10,999 --> 01:12:14,998
I don't know. Anyway, I
went outto California.

1386
01:12:14,999 --> 01:12:17,998
Lived with some girlfriends, got married.

1387
01:12:17,999 --> 01:12:20,999
So what do you mean, the
theater closed or something?

1388
01:12:22,999 --> 01:12:25,998
I mean I was in tennesseefor five minutes.

1389
01:12:25,999 --> 01:12:29,999
I went up thereto see you in that play.

1390
01:12:30,999 --> 01:12:32,999
To surprise you.

1391
01:12:34,999 --> 01:12:37,998
Well, then, you know.

1392
01:12:37,999 --> 01:12:39,999
You bastard.

1393
01:12:40,959 --> 01:12:42,998
I was never in that play.

1394
01:12:42,999 --> 01:12:44,998
I wasn't rightfor the role.

1395
01:12:44,999 --> 01:12:47,998
You persistent little swine!

1396
01:12:47,999 --> 01:12:49,998
God.

1397
01:12:49,999 --> 01:12:53,999
By mutual agreement, I left...

1398
01:12:55,999 --> 01:12:57,998
And I went to California.

1399
01:12:57,999 --> 01:13:01,998
So by mutual agreement, you
weren't right for the role.

1400
01:13:01,999 --> 01:13:03,501
That's right.

1401
01:13:03,999 --> 01:13:04,999
They fired you.

1402
01:13:06,999 --> 01:13:07,999
That's right.

1403
01:13:11,999 --> 01:13:13,998
So how longwere you married?

1404
01:13:13,999 --> 01:13:16,998
First time?

1405
01:13:16,999 --> 01:13:18,998
Two years.

1406
01:13:18,999 --> 01:13:21,999
I married a cokehead.

1407
01:13:23,999 --> 01:13:25,998
And I divorced him.

1408
01:13:25,999 --> 01:13:28,999
And then I marriedhis dealer.

1409
01:13:31,999 --> 01:13:33,998
So you did you havea bout
with drugs yourself?

1410
01:13:33,999 --> 01:13:36,998
"A bout with drugs."

1411
01:13:36,999 --> 01:13:39,998
That's a pretty compactlittle
way to put it.

1412
01:13:39,999 --> 01:13:42,998
Yes, I had one.Yes, I did.

1413
01:13:42,999 --> 01:13:46,999
The '80s were a, uh, world
championshipbout with drugs.

1414
01:13:50,999 --> 01:13:52,999
How come you never married?

1415
01:13:53,999 --> 01:13:55,999
You.

1416
01:13:59,999 --> 01:14:01,999
You knew me a week.

1417
01:14:02,999 --> 01:14:04,999
What can I tell you?

1418
01:14:07,999 --> 01:14:09,999
That's the craziest thingi ever heard.

1419
01:14:19,999 --> 01:14:21,998
Don't tell mewhat I saw.

1420
01:14:21,999 --> 01:14:23,998
I'm telling you... I got eyes, Buster.

1421
01:14:23,999 --> 01:14:26,998

mother-daughter envy thing.

1422
01:14:26,999 --> 01:14:28,998
I don't know. What? How dare you?

1423
01:14:28,999 --> 01:14:31,998
It's normal. Hey, you two.

1424
01:14:31,999 --> 01:14:32,998
You remember Lola?

1425
01:14:32,999 --> 01:14:36,998
I don't thinki can stay,
Eddie.You better take me home.

1426
01:14:36,999 --> 01:14:38,998
Uh, what's going on?

1427
01:14:38,999 --> 01:14:41,998
Too embarrassed to tell you. Uhh...

1428
01:14:41,999 --> 01:14:43,998
Eddie comes to pick me up.

1429
01:14:43,999 --> 01:14:45,998
While I'm getting ready, I'm come out.

1430
01:14:45,999 --> 01:14:48,998
He's, like, on the couchwith
my 15-year-old daughter.

1431
01:14:48,999 --> 01:14:50,998
I didn't know I wasn'tsupposed to sit down.

1432
01:14:50,999 --> 01:14:51,998
I saw what you were doing.

1433
01:14:51,999 --> 01:14:53,998
I met the girl20 seconds before.

1434
01:14:53,999 --> 01:14:56,998
Like, you know, I work that fast.

1435
01:14:56,999 --> 01:15:01,998
Oh, hi. Oh, it's you two.

1436
01:15:01,999 --> 01:15:03,998
Gosh, it's been awhile.

1437
01:15:03,999 --> 01:15:05,998
Didn't we go out one night? The four of us?

1438
01:15:05,999 --> 01:15:07,998
Yeah. It wasa long time ago, hon.

1439
01:15:07,999 --> 01:15:09,998
Right. How ya been?

1440
01:15:09,999 --> 01:15:11,998
There she wasin the phone book,

1441
01:15:11,999 --> 01:15:14,999
and her name just sort
ofjumped off the page at me.

1442
01:15:15,459 --> 01:15:17,998
I want y'all to knowi do not

1443
01:15:17,999 --> 01:15:19,998

1444
01:15:19,999 --> 01:15:22,998
I'd love to go swimming. Well, go swimming.

1445
01:15:22,999 --> 01:15:25,998
You don't need a suit. Yeah, right.

1447

Oh...

1449
01:15:40,999 --> 01:15:43,998
She comes into my officefor
her first divorce.

1450
01:15:43,999 --> 01:15:47,998
You know, way back. I boff her on my desk.

1451
01:15:47,999 --> 01:15:49,999
And now she needs a suitto go swimming.

1452
01:15:51,999 --> 01:15:53,998
She still lookspretty good, though, huh?

1453
01:15:53,999 --> 01:15:56,998
Yeah, looks good. Yours looks good.

1454
01:15:56,999 --> 01:15:59,998
You don't mind uspopping
in like this, do you?

1455
01:15:59,999 --> 01:16:02,999
Yeah. But what am igonna do about it?

1456
01:16:03,999 --> 01:16:06,998
Well, we won't stay.

1457
01:16:06,999 --> 01:16:08,998
Good.

1458
01:16:08,999 --> 01:16:10,998
You know, I used to own this place.

1459
01:16:10,999 --> 01:16:13,998
You did? Yeah. Built it.

1460
01:16:13,999 --> 01:16:16,998
It was all rental unitsback then.

1461
01:16:16,999 --> 01:16:18,998
Been remodeled a bunch.

1462
01:16:18,999 --> 01:16:20,998
I don't know whyi'm so surprised.

1463
01:16:20,999 --> 01:16:23,501
I mean, I hardlyeven knew you, reece.

1464
01:16:23,999 --> 01:16:25,879
You showed me just enoughto
keep me interested,

1465
01:16:25,999 --> 01:16:27,998
and then you... you just kept me out.

1466
01:16:27,999 --> 01:16:30,998
You told me nothing.

1467
01:16:30,999 --> 01:16:34,998
Well, it's a pretty good view.
It'd be a nice place for you.

1468
01:16:34,999 --> 01:16:36,998
Good price. Mm-hmm.

1469
01:16:36,999 --> 01:16:39,998
Awfully high up.

1470
01:16:39,999 --> 01:16:41,999
Yeah.

1471
01:16:42,999 --> 01:16:45,998
In Canada, you were on the ground floor.

1472
01:16:45,999 --> 01:16:47,999
I'm surprisedyou remember.

1473
01:16:49,999 --> 01:16:52,998
Well, at leasti came to visit.

1474
01:16:52,999 --> 01:16:54,998
Once.

1475
01:16:54,999 --> 01:16:56,999
One time.

1476
01:17:08,999 --> 01:17:11,998
How come you nevercame
back down to visit me?

1477
01:17:11,999 --> 01:17:13,998
Well, I wasn't a
schoolgirlhopping on airplanes

1478
01:17:13,999 --> 01:17:15,998
every weekendto go see my boyfriend, reece.

1479
01:17:15,999 --> 01:17:19,998
I had a responsibility. "Boyfriend"?

1480
01:17:19,999 --> 01:17:21,998
What about your responsibilitytoward us?

1481
01:17:21,999 --> 01:17:24,998
What "us"? There was no "us."

1482
01:17:24,999 --> 01:17:27,998
I realized that pretty
soonafter I moved away.

1483
01:17:27,999 --> 01:17:29,998
"There was no us." You're lying.

1484
01:17:29,999 --> 01:17:33,998
Now you're really lying.You moved.
That's what happened.

1485
01:17:33,999 --> 01:17:35,998
We had a life, and you left it.

1486
01:17:35,999 --> 01:17:37,998
What kind of a lifedid we have?

1487
01:17:37,999 --> 01:17:40,998
A pretty darn good one.lt was casual, easy.

1488
01:17:40,999 --> 01:17:43,998
Casual? Oh, brother, was it casual, yes.

1489
01:17:43,999 --> 01:17:46,998
I don't remember youhating
it so much way back then.

1490
01:17:46,999 --> 01:17:48,998
I did.

1491
01:17:48,999 --> 01:17:50,998
Oh, you did? You hated the...

1492
01:17:50,999 --> 01:17:53,998
yes, I hated it! I hate
somethingthat starts out good,

1493
01:17:53,999 --> 01:17:55,998
and just stays there, reece,

1494
01:17:55,999 --> 01:17:58,998
and it doesn't move
forwardinto something better.

1495
01:17:58,999 --> 01:18:01,999
Casual and good... reece, that
just wasn'tgood enough for me.

1496
01:18:03,999 --> 01:18:04,999
Well...

1497
01:18:05,584 --> 01:18:07,667
I didn't take youout dancing every night.

1498
01:18:07,999 --> 01:18:08,998
Not every night, no.

1499
01:18:08,999 --> 01:18:10,998
Why didn't you expressyour grievances...

1500
01:18:10,999 --> 01:18:12,998
why didn't youexpress your grievances?

1501
01:18:12,999 --> 01:18:13,998
Because that's notsomething I do.

1502
01:18:13,999 --> 01:18:15,998
I'm not very expressive.

1503
01:18:15,999 --> 01:18:17,998
Well, I was the one who saidwe
should go away for a weekend,

1504
01:18:17,999 --> 01:18:20,998
because we've nevereven gone
awayfor one weekend, reece.

1505
01:18:20,999 --> 01:18:21,998
And when you did, what did I do?
I took you.

1506
01:18:21,999 --> 01:18:23,998
Yes, but where wereyour ideas?

1507
01:18:23,999 --> 01:18:25,998
My God, you were young, you were vital.

1508
01:18:25,999 --> 01:18:28,998
You could've hada thought.

1509
01:18:28,999 --> 01:18:30,998
"Young and vital"... yes.

1510
01:18:30,999 --> 01:18:34,998
You were young.You were vital.I
don't know when it ended.

1511
01:18:34,999 --> 01:18:36,999
Well, it's ended.

1512
01:18:37,542 --> 01:18:38,999
Yeah, I can see that.

1513
01:18:40,999 --> 01:18:42,998
I'm just sayingi don't know when it ended,

1514
01:18:42,999 --> 01:18:45,998
because I wasn't thereto see it end, reece.

1515
01:18:45,999 --> 01:18:47,998
I wasn't thereto see you end.

1516
01:18:47,999 --> 01:18:49,998
It started to endwhen you left.

1517
01:18:49,999 --> 01:18:50,998
I shouldn'thave to tell you that.

1518
01:18:50,999 --> 01:18:52,998
Go ahead and tell me.
Just rub it in my face.

1519
01:18:52,999 --> 01:18:54,999
Go ahead.

1520
01:19:09,999 --> 01:19:12,998
Well, look, it's nobody's fault, I guess.

1521
01:19:12,999 --> 01:19:14,998
You couldn't have itboth ways forever.

1522
01:19:14,999 --> 01:19:16,998
You couldn't have mesort
of on the side forever,

1523
01:19:16,999 --> 01:19:18,998
and I should've said thatpoint-blank.

1524
01:19:18,999 --> 01:19:21,998
I should've come right out, and
I should've spoken my mind.

1525
01:19:21,999 --> 01:19:23,998
Yeah, you should have.
You're speaking it now.

1526
01:19:23,999 --> 01:19:24,998
Yeah.

1527
01:19:24,999 --> 01:19:26,998
I mean, everything is easier to do

1528
01:19:26,999 --> 01:19:27,998
when you do it too late.

1529
01:19:27,999 --> 01:19:30,998
Basically, what happened was you...

1530
01:19:30,999 --> 01:19:31,998
Left the country.

1531
01:19:31,999 --> 01:19:34,998
Not believing thatyou wouldn't let me go.

1532
01:19:34,999 --> 01:19:36,998
You said you had to go.
There was no other way.

1533
01:19:36,999 --> 01:19:38,719
What was I supposed to do, chase after you?

1534
01:19:38,999 --> 01:19:40,375
I expected youto leave her, okay?

1535
01:19:40,999 --> 01:19:41,999
Oh.

1536
01:19:43,999 --> 01:19:45,199
Her life was over, over, over,

1537
01:19:45,584 --> 01:19:47,998
the day she satat that red light.

1538
01:19:47,999 --> 01:19:50,998
Years beforei even met you,
reece, her life was over.

1539
01:19:50,999 --> 01:19:51,998
Damn it! Damn you, reece!

1540
01:19:51,999 --> 01:19:53,998
I expected youto face that.

1541
01:19:53,999 --> 01:19:55,998
I expected you to face me.

1542
01:19:55,999 --> 01:19:58,998
And... I don't know. One
place, another place,

1543
01:19:58,999 --> 01:20:01,999
both places, we'd be
togethersomehow, some way.

1544
01:20:02,999 --> 01:20:04,999
Reece...

1545
01:20:06,999 --> 01:20:08,999
Oh...

1546
01:20:10,999 --> 01:20:12,998
Look, we can arguetill
we're blue in the face,

1547
01:20:12,999 --> 01:20:16,999
and it's not gonnabring back those
years, so I should just... shut up.

1548
01:20:29,999 --> 01:20:31,998
When I firstwent up there

1549
01:20:31,999 --> 01:20:33,998
to live with dottie,

1550
01:20:33,999 --> 01:20:37,998
do you know I used tolie
in bed at night thinking,

1551
01:20:37,999 --> 01:20:39,999
how did this happen?

1552
01:20:41,167 --> 01:20:43,998
Yeah, I had nightslike that too.

1553
01:20:43,999 --> 01:20:45,998
You knew howi felt about you.

1554
01:20:45,999 --> 01:20:49,501
I know. There was me,

1555
01:20:49,999 --> 01:20:51,999
but there wasjoleen quillet too.

1556
01:20:53,999 --> 01:20:55,998
Yeah, I knewabout her, reece.

1557
01:20:55,999 --> 01:20:57,999
I could tell when louiswas
reading his letter,

1558
01:20:58,876 --> 01:21:00,998
because I was readingyour face.

1559
01:21:00,999 --> 01:21:02,999
The letter didn't fool me.

1560
01:21:06,999 --> 01:21:11,999
She must've loved you... Very much.

1561
01:21:21,999 --> 01:21:24,998
Look, I was with hera couple of times.

1562
01:21:24,999 --> 01:21:27,667
She was very lonely. She
threw herself at me.

1563
01:21:27,999 --> 01:21:28,998
Oh, didn't we all?

1564
01:21:28,999 --> 01:21:31,998
Then I met you, and that
was the end of that.

1565
01:21:31,999 --> 01:21:33,998
You mean you weren'tfooling around
with both of usat one time?

1566
01:21:33,999 --> 01:21:36,999
No, I was not.Well, I didn't know that.

1567
01:21:38,999 --> 01:21:40,999
I didn't know that.

1568
01:21:52,999 --> 01:21:54,998
Back then on that hill,

1569
01:21:54,999 --> 01:21:57,999
when we took that little trip, you know?

1570
01:21:59,999 --> 01:22:02,998
When you, uh...

1571
01:22:02,999 --> 01:22:06,999
Made it up in your mindthat
you were gonna move...

1572
01:22:11,999 --> 01:22:14,998
You weren't thinking
that... that I was carrying on

1573
01:22:14,999 --> 01:22:16,999
with joleen as well as youat the same time?

1574
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,998
All those years?

1575
01:22:19,999 --> 01:22:23,999
Partially that, yes.Oh, God, Carol, no.

1576
01:22:24,999 --> 01:22:27,999
God almighty.

1577
01:22:29,999 --> 01:22:32,999
I'm gonnaask you a question.

1578
01:22:34,999 --> 01:22:38,998

Thank you.That helps.

1588
01:23:15,999 --> 01:23:19,998
We're almostour parents' age.

1589
01:23:19,999 --> 01:23:21,998
What the helldoes that mean?

1590
01:23:21,999 --> 01:23:24,998
Well, when they met, they were our age.

1591
01:23:24,999 --> 01:23:27,998
I mean, we'rea little bit younger, but...

1592
01:23:27,999 --> 01:23:31,998
Yeah. Wow.

1593
01:23:31,999 --> 01:23:33,998
Well, there's somethingyou don't know.

1594
01:23:33,999 --> 01:23:35,999
What? About them?

1595
01:23:36,999 --> 01:23:38,999
About us.

1596
01:23:39,999 --> 01:23:42,998
We met a long time ago.

1597
01:23:42,999 --> 01:23:44,998
Well, yeah. I know.

1598
01:23:44,999 --> 01:23:48,998
Right beforemy Tennessee debut.

1599
01:23:48,999 --> 01:23:50,999
Uh-uh. Before that.

1600
01:23:53,999 --> 01:23:55,999
What are youtalking about?

1601
01:23:56,999 --> 01:23:58,998
We were in our teens.

1602
01:23:58,999 --> 01:24:01,999
I was 15.

1603
01:24:06,999 --> 01:24:08,998
I don't remember that.

1604
01:24:08,999 --> 01:24:10,998
I know you don't.

1605
01:24:10,999 --> 01:24:14,998
Well? Tell me. What?

1606
01:24:14,999 --> 01:24:16,999
You lied to me.

1607
01:24:18,999 --> 01:24:21,998
Well, I can't deny thatuntil
I've heard the facts.

1608
01:24:21,999 --> 01:24:23,998
Well, we met one summerout at the lake,

1609
01:24:23,999 --> 01:24:26,998
and you told me your
namewas Sharon childress,

1610
01:24:26,999 --> 01:24:29,998
and that you werefrom
Washington, d.C.Oh, my God.

1611
01:24:29,999 --> 01:24:31,998
And that your dadwas a foreign agent.

1612
01:24:31,999 --> 01:24:33,998
Oh, my God!

1613
01:24:33,999 --> 01:24:36,998
And it was very,
veryhush-hush and secretive.

1614
01:24:36,999 --> 01:24:39,998
Oh, my God.

1615
01:24:39,999 --> 01:24:41,998
Oh, my God, oh, my God.

1616
01:24:41,999 --> 01:24:44,998
Oh, I was sucha screwed-up little girl.

1617
01:24:44,999 --> 01:24:47,998
Wait a minute.

1618
01:24:47,999 --> 01:24:49,998
We went out in the woodsthat afternoon,

1619
01:24:49,999 --> 01:24:51,998
and we made outlike a couple of banshees.

1620
01:24:51,999 --> 01:24:55,998
Then it turns out our
folkswere together for lunch.

1621
01:24:55,999 --> 01:24:59,998
Wow. That was you? Seriously?

1622
01:24:59,999 --> 01:25:03,998
Well, why didn't youtell me
this before, when we met again?

1623
01:25:03,999 --> 01:25:06,998
Well, I was going to. I was
gonna tell youone night in bed,

1624
01:25:06,999 --> 01:25:09,998
but I decided... ah, I decided to wait,

1625
01:25:09,999 --> 01:25:12,999
or maybe you'd remember or...

1626
01:25:14,999 --> 01:25:18,998
I don't know. I just waswaiting
for the right momentor something.

1627
01:25:18,999 --> 01:25:21,999
But then, you got gone so fast.

1628
01:25:22,999 --> 01:25:24,998
I was wild.

1629
01:25:24,999 --> 01:25:26,998
What's changed?

1630
01:25:26,999 --> 01:25:29,998
Well, I still docrazy things.

1631
01:25:29,999 --> 01:25:32,999
I always have.

1632
01:25:34,999 --> 01:25:36,998
I'm so embarrassed.

1633
01:25:36,999 --> 01:25:40,998
I'm trying to picture youliving
in my houseas my husband,

1634
01:25:40,999 --> 01:25:44,998
being a fatherto my kids. Uh...

1635
01:25:44,999 --> 01:25:48,998
Like telling themabout how we first met.

1636
01:25:48,999 --> 01:25:50,999
Wouldn't give themtoo many details though.

1637
01:25:54,999 --> 01:25:57,998
Would you bea good husband to me?

1638
01:25:57,999 --> 01:26:00,998
A good daddy to my kids?

1639
01:26:00,999 --> 01:26:03,999
We'll never know.

1640
01:26:12,999 --> 01:26:14,999
Wh...

1641
01:26:15,999 --> 01:26:17,998
hey, let's go swimming.

1642
01:26:17,999 --> 01:26:20,998
Well, if you'd just told
meto bring my suit...

1643
01:26:20,999 --> 01:26:22,999
Well, it doesn't matter. Come on.

1644
01:26:28,999 --> 01:26:30,998
Come on.

1645
01:26:30,999 --> 01:26:32,998
Who wants to go swimming?

1646
01:26:32,999 --> 01:26:35,999
Fine.

1647
01:26:39,999 --> 01:26:41,999
Ohh.

1648
01:26:42,999 --> 01:26:44,999
Oh, it's warm.

1649
01:26:49,999 --> 01:26:52,998
Come on out, Katherine.

1650
01:26:52,999 --> 01:26:54,998
You're gonna swim naked, aren't you, Eddie?

1651
01:26:54,999 --> 01:26:56,998
I'm a man.I don't swim naked.

1652
01:26:56,999 --> 01:26:57,998
The women swim naked.

1653
01:26:57,999 --> 01:26:59,998
You're sexist.

1654
01:26:59,999 --> 01:27:01,998
You figured me out.

1655
01:27:01,999 --> 01:27:05,998
You better changeyour ways, Buster.

1656
01:27:05,999 --> 01:27:08,998
Lola, the seasons may change,
the world may change,

1657
01:27:08,999 --> 01:27:11,998
but I will never change, my darling.

1658
01:27:11,999 --> 01:27:12,999
Hallelujah.

1659
01:27:16,999 --> 01:27:18,999
He's gonna change.

1660
01:27:24,999 --> 01:27:27,998
You're not gonnastay around here, are you?

1661
01:27:27,999 --> 01:27:31,998
No. I can't.

1662
01:27:31,999 --> 01:27:33,999
You know me.

1663
01:27:34,999 --> 01:27:37,999
But I'll be back though.

1664
01:27:42,999 --> 01:27:44,999
Come on in the water,
tom.You know you want to.

1665
01:27:47,999 --> 01:27:49,998
Come on! Do it!

1666
01:27:49,999 --> 01:27:52,998
Whoa!

1667
01:27:52,999 --> 01:27:55,999
You made it!

1668
01:28:09,999 --> 01:28:12,998
They're not coming.

1669
01:28:12,999 --> 01:28:16,998
They're coming. They'll be here.

1670
01:28:16,999 --> 01:28:20,998
How'd they knowwhich exact placeand so on?

1671
01:28:20,999 --> 01:28:22,999
Well, I wasvery specific.

1672
01:28:27,999 --> 01:28:30,998
Where'd you get the beer? I brought them.

1673
01:28:30,999 --> 01:28:32,999
Give me a beer.

1674
01:28:33,999 --> 01:28:35,998
You quit drinkinga long time ago.

1675
01:28:35,999 --> 01:28:38,998
Yeah. I quit drinking, I quit smoking,

1676
01:28:38,999 --> 01:28:40,998
quit working.

1677
01:28:40,999 --> 01:28:43,999
I quit just about everything.
Now just give me a damn beer.

1678
01:28:49,999 --> 01:28:51,998
And a cigarette.You got a cigarette?

1679
01:28:51,999 --> 01:28:53,998
I quit smoking.You did?

1680
01:28:53,999 --> 01:28:55,999
A very long time ago.

1681
01:28:59,999 --> 01:29:01,999
Twist-off.

1682
01:29:03,999 --> 01:29:06,999
I can't rememberanything anymore.

1683
01:29:07,999 --> 01:29:09,998
Well, hell, dad, I'm in my 40s,

1684
01:29:09,999 --> 01:29:12,998
and I don't rememberanything either.

1685
01:29:12,999 --> 01:29:14,998
And you say that kidding.

1686
01:29:14,999 --> 01:29:16,999
See, but I'm not kidding.

1687
01:29:20,999 --> 01:29:22,999
When was the last timei saw Carol?

1688
01:29:24,999 --> 01:29:26,999
About six years ago.

1689
01:29:31,999 --> 01:29:33,998
She was...

1690
01:29:33,999 --> 01:29:35,998
she was gonna move into a
condowe were looking at.

1691
01:29:35,999 --> 01:29:37,998
What ever happenedwith that?

1692
01:29:37,999 --> 01:29:38,999
What do you mean, "we were looking at"?

1693
01:29:39,292 --> 01:29:42,998
I was helping herfind a condo.

1694
01:29:42,999 --> 01:29:44,998
Oh, you weren't goingto move in with her?

1695
01:29:44,999 --> 01:29:46,998
What do you mean, "move in with her"? No.

1696
01:29:46,999 --> 01:29:48,998
Why not?

1697
01:29:48,999 --> 01:29:50,998
What's the matterwith you?

1698
01:29:50,999 --> 01:29:52,834
What's the matterwith you?

1699
01:29:52,999 --> 01:29:54,999
There's nothingthe matter with me.

1700
01:29:57,999 --> 01:30:00,998
Well, her daughter, katherine,

1701
01:30:00,999 --> 01:30:04,998
moved down to the Gulf,
and Carol went with her.

1702
01:30:04,999 --> 01:30:07,998
Yeah. Seems like I canremember
something like that.

1703
01:30:07,999 --> 01:30:09,998
Well, she sent you postcardsfor awhile.

1704
01:30:09,999 --> 01:30:11,999
Who did? Carol.

1705
01:30:13,999 --> 01:30:16,998
I don't rememberif she did or not.

1706
01:30:16,999 --> 01:30:20,998
Well, she did, dad, and you know it.

1707
01:30:20,999 --> 01:30:23,999
Yeah. She was a funny woman.

1708
01:30:26,999 --> 01:30:28,999
What was funny about her?

1709
01:30:31,999 --> 01:30:35,999
Well, you never knewwhat
Carol was thinking.

1710
01:30:36,999 --> 01:30:38,999
That works both ways.

1711
01:31:21,999 --> 01:31:24,501
What... what's it been,

1712
01:31:24,999 --> 01:31:26,998
five, six years?

1713
01:31:26,999 --> 01:31:29,999
Seven?

1714
01:31:30,999 --> 01:31:31,999
Oh!

1715
01:31:35,999 --> 01:31:38,998
Well, she thoughtshe could make it up here,

1716
01:31:38,999 --> 01:31:43,998
but after the ride overfrom the
beach, she's not up to it.

1717
01:31:43,999 --> 01:31:45,998
She wanted me to ask you twoif
you'd meet up at the hotel,

1718
01:31:45,999 --> 01:31:48,998
follow me up there.

1719
01:31:48,999 --> 01:31:49,999
Something wrongwith her?

1720
01:31:51,999 --> 01:31:55,998
Well, sir, to tell you the truth,

1721
01:31:55,999 --> 01:31:57,999
mom's gotwhat her sister had.

1722
01:31:59,999 --> 01:32:02,998
Uh, she's had it for years

1723
01:32:02,999 --> 01:32:04,999
and never let on.

1724
01:32:07,999 --> 01:32:09,999
Of the two, my motherwas
never one to complain.

1725
01:32:16,999 --> 01:32:17,999
Dad?

1726
01:32:20,999 --> 01:32:22,999
How bad is she?

1727
01:32:23,999 --> 01:32:25,998
She's dying?

1728
01:32:25,999 --> 01:32:27,999
Yeah.

1729
01:32:30,999 --> 01:32:33,998
You give my dad one of
thosewhen he comes back?

1730
01:32:33,999 --> 01:32:36,751
Yeah. Sure.

1731
01:32:40,918 --> 01:32:42,999
So, you wake up every
morninghearing the ocean?

1732
01:32:43,999 --> 01:32:46,998
Yeah. Walk on the beach,

1733
01:32:46,999 --> 01:32:48,998
bundle up in winter.

1734
01:32:48,999 --> 01:32:51,999
Mom used to go with me,
but she can't anymore.

1735
01:32:54,999 --> 01:32:57,999
Yeah, I like the beach.

1736
01:32:58,999 --> 01:33:00,999
I'm kind of like my dad. I...

1737
01:33:02,999 --> 01:33:05,998
Could never liveanywhere but here, I guess.

1738
01:33:05,999 --> 01:33:08,998
Yeah, sure. I know.

1739
01:33:08,999 --> 01:33:12,998
But I don't think of youas
much like your father.

1740
01:33:12,999 --> 01:33:14,998
Maybe you are.

1741
01:33:14,999 --> 01:33:16,999
You kind of growinto being like your dad.

1742
01:33:19,999 --> 01:33:21,998
So, who's your latest lady?

1743
01:33:21,999 --> 01:33:23,999
Nobody, really.

1744
01:33:24,999 --> 01:33:27,999
You should be married, have
a big old family by now.

1745
01:33:29,999 --> 01:33:32,998
Yeah. There's this, uh...

1746
01:33:32,999 --> 01:33:34,998
there's this oldrobert mitchum movie.

1747
01:33:34,999 --> 01:33:36,998
It was on t.V.And he's some detective

1748
01:33:36,999 --> 01:33:39,584
or something, and, uh,

1749
01:33:39,999 --> 01:33:43,998
the woman he's withis talking
about her familyand her husband.

1750
01:33:43,999 --> 01:33:46,998
She drones on, and finally
she stops talking.

1751
01:33:46,999 --> 01:33:48,998
He sort of looks at herand says,

1752
01:33:48,999 --> 01:33:51,998
"I never married."

1753
01:33:51,999 --> 01:33:53,998
I don't know. But, wow, did
that linepack a wallop to me.

1754
01:33:53,999 --> 01:33:58,999
I mean, maybe nobody
elsein the world got it.

1755
01:34:00,999 --> 01:34:02,999
Who's your latest?

1756
01:34:05,999 --> 01:34:07,998
You.

1757
01:34:07,999 --> 01:34:09,998
Me, huh?

1758
01:34:09,999 --> 01:34:13,998
Yeah, I'm herewith you right
now, so I'm your latest.

1759
01:34:13,999 --> 01:34:15,998
Same old Katherine.

1760
01:34:15,999 --> 01:34:18,998
No. No.

1761
01:34:18,999 --> 01:34:21,998
I mean, you grow up some,

1762
01:34:21,999 --> 01:34:24,999
whether you want to or not.

1763
01:34:40,999 --> 01:34:42,999
I always went for you.

1764
01:34:43,999 --> 01:34:46,998
I just couldn't stoplong enough...

1765
01:34:46,999 --> 01:34:48,999
To love me?

1766
01:34:52,834 --> 01:34:53,999
Well, yeah.

1767
01:34:54,918 --> 01:34:56,999
I just couldn't stoplong enough.

1768
01:34:59,999 --> 01:35:02,999
You have always loved me, haven't you?

01:38:36,459 --> 01:38:38,998

1806
01:39:02,999 --> 01:39:05,998
It doesn't matter. You're gonna
kill usbefore we catch her.

1807
01:39:05,999 --> 01:39:08,998
I cannot believethat you let her go again.

1808
01:39:08,999 --> 01:39:10,998

It's all gonna work out.Just
a little more time.

1810
01:39:13,999 --> 01:39:15,998
How would you know anything? Things
don't work outby themselves.

1811
01:39:15,999 --> 01:39:18,998
You gotta make them work
out.Watch the road!

1812
01:39:18,999 --> 01:39:20,998
Time is laughingat you, boy.

1813
01:39:20,999 --> 01:39:24,998
You want things to turn around,
you gotta turn them around!

1814
01:39:24,999 --> 01:39:26,998
Turn around.

1815
01:39:26,999 --> 01:39:28,998
If I gotta lead you by the
nose, I'm gonna lead you.

1816
01:39:28,999 --> 01:39:30,998
