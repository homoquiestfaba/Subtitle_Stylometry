00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:53,000
Every kid does.

375
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,830
This is my bed.

376
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:56,010
And this is my bed.

377
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:57,330
So keep off it.

378
00:16:57,330 --> 00:16:58,030
David.

379
00:16:58,030 --> 00:16:59,770
Well it's mine.

380
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:01,770
You get toys, too.

381
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:03,210
You can earn points to buy more.

382
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:06,680
You like it?

383
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,640
What is he?

384
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,030
Stupid?

385
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:09,840
Can he talk?

386
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:10,540
That's enough.

387
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:11,660
David, that's enough.

388
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:12,520
Jacob.

389
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,820
Jacob.

390
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:14,810
Jacob.

391
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:15,510
Jacob, listen.

392
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:17,540
I know it's a lot to take in.

393
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:19,720
All these boys have been in the
same shoes as to you've been.

394
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,840
And it's going to be OK.

395
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,610
If you let us, it's
going to be fine.

396
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:24,390
Jacob, look at me.

397
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:26,170
You could give us a
chance to help you.

398
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:26,950
Just let us help you.

399
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:27,920
You'll be fine.

400
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:28,910
Jacob, look at me.

401
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:29,610
Jacob.

402
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:29,920
No.

403
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:30,620
Look at me.

404
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:31,900
It's going to be OK.

405
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:32,890
You're going to be fine.

406
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:34,670
You're going to be fine.

407
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:35,370
Jacob.

408
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:41,310
It's OK.

409
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,790
It's OK.

410
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:46,270
It's going to be fine.

411
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:47,250
So who's the new kid?

412
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:49,030
The kid the bus
brought in today.

413
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:50,190
What's his story?

414
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:53,180
You know I'm not going to
answer a question like that.

415
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:54,880
What's the big deal?

416
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,700
How'd you like if I talked
about you with the other kids?

417
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:04,190
Rusty, that's for the horses.

418
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:09,180
Never seen him take
anybody like he has to you.

419
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:11,700
We both been through a lot.

420
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:12,400
That's why.

421
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:18,630
If you mix red and
blue, you get purple.

422
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:19,770
You know that?

423
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:20,470
Yeah.

424
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:22,600
Like the color of a bruise.

425
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,910
Or a plum.

426
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:25,750
Or an eggplant.

427
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,670
I thought eggs
came from chickens.

428
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:28,700
It's a vegetable.

429
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,320
Nothing to do with eggs.

430
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,210
Yeah?

431
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:33,120
Huh.

432
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:36,820
Yeah, maybe you could plant
one in your garden patch.

433
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:38,370
Maybe.

434
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:42,500
How about using some of
those colors you've mixed,

435
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,440
Maybe painting a picture.

436
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:47,950
Do they pay you by the number
of pictures us kids turn out?

437
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:48,710
No.

438
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:50,760
Did you paint for your
last art instructor?

439
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,430
You're not an instructor.

440
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:53,130
You're a therapist.

441
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:57,740
I asked Mr. Ogly
about the new kid.

442
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:58,440
Oh?

443
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,330
And?

444
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:02,480
He wouldn't tell me anything.

445
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,770
Did you think he would?

446
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:07,720
I heard he freaked
out in his room.

447
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,690
I heard he doesn't talk.

448
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,790
And that's just creepy.

449
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:15,760
Creepy around here
is saying something.

450
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:23,550
I bet he got beat
up a lot of home.

451
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:30,460
I bet his mom had a boyfriend
who drank a lot, took drugs.

452
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,420
And cut it when he didn't
do what he was told.

453
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,670
Is there more red?

454
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:40,660
Yeah.

455
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:42,640
There's some right over
there on the table.

456
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:56,550
Serve it.

457
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:58,440
Looking at these
kids, it's pretty hard

458
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:01,480
To believe this could
be their last chance.

459
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,800
Most of them have been bounced
through a dozen foster homes

460
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,250
Before finding this place.

461
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:08,140
I wish my daughter
knew how lucky she is.

462
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,550
Having trouble
adjusting to the move.

463
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:12,000
Oh, yeah.

464
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,380
She misses her
friends from Seattle.

Complains about me
working too much.

466

How long you been divorced?

467
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:24,000
Um, six years.

468
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:24,700
Six years.

469
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:25,730
How about you?

470
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:27,570
Ever think of getting married?

471
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:28,490
Having kids?

472
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:29,410
Aaah.

473
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:31,570
I've got a whole
village of them, right.

474
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:35,050
Well, thank god
for the village.

475
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:36,050
Mhm.

476
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:38,490
God.

Yvonne and Sara.

478
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:44,050
Those gals, they never
take no for an answer.

479
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:45,380
No.

480
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:47,180
No.

481
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:48,730
We are full here.

482
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:50,720
Every place full.

483
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,050
Typhoon has made
many new orphans.

484
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:53,720
But what about these children?

485
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,430
We've been to five
other orphanages.

486
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:56,670
And no one will take them.

487
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:58,720
How can you turn them away?

488
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,170
They are not ours.

489
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:05,250
Japanese, you mean?

490
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:06,900
They most certainly are.

491
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:07,870
Only part.

492
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:09,810
Other part American.

493
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,800
You won't take them because
they're a mixed race?

494
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:14,140
What difference does
their background make?

495
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:15,540
They're children.

496
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:16,930
Mm.

497
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:18,920
Children, yes.

498
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:19,940
Not ours.

499
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:21,030
I'm very sorry.

500
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:27,440
OK, honeys.

501
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,040
What have we gotten
ourselves into?

Come on, honey.

503
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:33,030
Come on.

504
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:34,030
Come on, come on.

I thought you might be cold.

507
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,220
Why don't you want
the covers on?

508
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:19,140
My Mom used to tuck
me in all the time.

509
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:21,970
She used to let me light
her cigarettes for her, too.

510
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:27,050
She's coming to get me soon.

511
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:29,980
I think.

512
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:32,410
I don't hear from her much.

513
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:34,900
That's because she's been sick.

514
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:38,040
I bet or something.

Who are you?

This is Granger.

523
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:35,000
He's helping me study.

524
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:35,710
Oh.

525
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:37,910
Little old to be the
same class, aren't you?

526
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:39,710
I'm not actually in school.

527
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:40,950
We met at the mall.

528
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:41,870
Right.

529
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:43,010
Well, Granger.

530
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:43,970
It's a little late.

531
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:46,010
And my daughter's a little
young for all this help.

532
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:47,800
So maybe you could find
your way to the door.

And neither will I.

Sometimes I think we try to
be too many places at once.

00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,690
Did you call Bob
and let him know

542
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:13,930
That were going to
be late tonight?

Hello, honey.

547
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:23,250
Some interesting information on
the Jacob Fletcher case today.

548
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:25,510
Their Arizona record is clean.

But a neighbor called and
mentioned seeing a Colorado

License plate when
they moved in.

00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:33,070
And as usual, without
a national database,

552
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:35,300
Their records didn't follow
them from state to state.

553
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,940
How many times have we
come up against this?

554
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:38,710
And somebody's got to
close that loophole.

555
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:41,350
That may just have to
be you and me, Yvonne.

556
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:42,050
Admit it.

557
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:44,490
You were wondering what to
do with all that spare time.

00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:46,820
Remind me again why we

YVONNE: Before we left Japan,
we had 100 children in our care.

929
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:31,250
We came back and
built four orphanages

930
00:44:31,250 --> 00:44:33,390
That went on to help thousands.

931
00:44:33,390 --> 00:44:35,890
By then, there was
a controversial war

Waging in Southeast Asia.

00:44:37,730 --> 00:44:40,820

managed to build five more

Orphanages and a children's
hospital in Vietnam.

935

When the bombs began to fall, we
had no choice but to evacuate.

Operation Babyland.

Can you take this one, please?

00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:21,030
Let's get the sick ones and
the youngest ones off first.

I need to talk to you.

We were expecting more.

Did you get all the kids out
of the China Beach orphanage.

958
00:45:29,490 --> 00:45:30,430
No.

959
00:45:30,430 --> 00:45:32,480
The Viet Cong were
coming too fast.

960
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:35,130
We barely got the
plane off the ground.

961
00:45:35,130 --> 00:45:36,370
There was fire all around us.

962
00:45:36,370 --> 00:45:37,060
But the children...

963
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:44,900
We got as many as we could.

964
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:46,460
If we hadn't left when we did.

965
00:45:49,390 --> 00:45:52,470
As we took off and banked
left over the beach,

966
00:45:52,470 --> 00:45:54,610
We see the staff getting
the others out by bus.

967
00:45:57,270 --> 00:46:01,910
When I looked back, I saw the
rest of the children being

968
00:46:01,910 --> 00:46:04,060
Pulled out of their hiding
places out onto the beach.

969
00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:07,770
They were lined up.

970
00:46:07,770 --> 00:46:11,480
And they just shot them.

971
00:46:17,150 --> 00:46:19,210
I'm sorry.

972
00:46:19,210 --> 00:46:20,200
It's OK.

After all we did,
it wasn't enough.

So then we just
have to do more.

And I want you to
make that happen.

Jacob has had a very difficult
time adjusting and he...

983
00:46:53,090 --> 00:46:56,130
Of course he's had a very
difficult time adjusting.

00:46:56,130 --> 00:46:58,160
He's surrounded by strangers.

00:47:00,030 --> 00:47:01,390
He needs to be safe.

987
00:47:01,390 --> 00:47:03,330
The boy needs to know
that there are people who

00:47:03,330 --> 00:47:05,790
Care about him, who
want the best for him.

isn't your decision,

Not when it comes
right down to it.

And he's not your property.

Will you arrange the visit.

Or do I bring the
courts into this?

We can't stop you
from seeing him.

But I swear I will walk through
fire to make sure you don't

997
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:19,510
Have control over
his life again.

Dig deeper.

getting that boy back again.

wash the brushes, please?

1015

He'd fill the tub
with hot water.

1016
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:40,380
Only the hot.

1017
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:41,330
He'd push me in.

1018
00:48:45,390 --> 00:48:46,320
My skin blistered sometimes.

1019
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:52,500
Did he give you a reason why?

1020
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:56,470
Maybe I didn't get him
a beer when he asked.

1021
00:48:56,470 --> 00:49:00,480
Or maybe he didn't like
the way I looked at him.

1022
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:02,620
Sometimes he'd lock me
in the closet at night.

1023
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:08,470
I couldn't get out to eat
or go to the bathroom.

1024
00:49:08,470 --> 00:49:11,330
My sister would shove food
in the crack under the door

1025
00:49:11,330 --> 00:49:13,990
If he didn't catch her.

1026
00:49:13,990 --> 00:49:16,100
Did he hurt her, too.

1027
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:19,550
I'd sleep in front of
her on the bed at night,

1028
00:49:19,550 --> 00:49:24,250
Push her against the wall
so he couldn't reach her.

1029
00:49:24,250 --> 00:49:25,450
So he'd take me instead.

1030
00:49:31,250 --> 00:49:34,580
Where was your mother
when this was happening?

00:49:34,580 --> 00:49:35,280

1033
00:49:37,850 --> 00:49:39,580
Did she know what was going on?

1034
00:49:39,580 --> 00:49:41,920
She says she didn't.

1035
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:42,860
Did you ever tell her?

1036
00:49:42,860 --> 00:49:45,110
Did you ever ask
her to make it stop?

1037
00:49:45,110 --> 00:49:46,460
Johnny called me
a liar and said

1038
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:49,490
That he would move out
if Mom took my side.

1039
00:49:49,490 --> 00:49:51,310
So she believed him.

1040
00:49:54,250 --> 00:49:56,490
Even after.

But only here and
with supervision,

Unless and until the
courts say otherwise.

how he feels about that?

won't meet my mom.

Don't you want to meet her?

Asked us to meet with you.

1128

from agency to agency,

the kitchen sink at it.

1138

like that, you'd need a...

experience at all,

what won't work.

01:12:50,870 --> 01:12:53,480
We should have never allowed
him to go back to that woman.

1455
01:12:53,480 --> 01:12:55,380
Honey, we had no choice.

1456
01:12:55,380 --> 01:12:58,340
We should have fought
harder, found ways, something.

1457
01:13:01,010 --> 01:13:03,280
It's like I'm losing
my own son again.

1458
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:04,410
It's 20 years ago.

1459
01:13:04,410 --> 01:13:05,950
And I'm hearing about
the crash, knowing

1460
01:13:05,950 --> 01:13:07,530
There's nothing I can do.

1461
01:13:10,870 --> 01:13:14,480
If we can't save one small boy.

1462
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:16,680
We have saved thousands, Sara.

1463
01:13:16,680 --> 01:13:19,720
Thousands aren't
enough, not today.

1464
01:13:19,720 --> 01:13:21,190
It should have been one more.

1465
01:13:21,190 --> 01:13:22,950
It should have been Michael.

1466
01:13:22,950 --> 01:13:23,650
Shh.

1467
01:13:29,450 --> 01:13:32,430
I know you must be missing
my chicken sandwiches.

1468
01:13:32,430 --> 01:13:35,280
They've got chicken here.

1469
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:37,170
Not like mine, I bet.

1470
01:13:37,170 --> 01:13:39,370
Johnny's never coming back.

1471
01:13:39,370 --> 01:13:40,170
Did you know that?

1472
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:46,430
I told him that
he wasn't welcome.

1473
01:13:46,430 --> 01:13:47,570
You were right.

1474
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:53,180
It was thing to do,
to protect Karen.

1475
01:13:53,180 --> 01:13:55,920
And to prove to you that I
mean what I've been saying.

1476
01:13:59,440 --> 01:14:02,600
You're my life, Laura.

1477
01:14:02,600 --> 01:14:03,400
You and your sister.

1478
01:14:08,530 --> 01:14:11,020
Why should she
believe you, Mrs. Wade?

1479
01:14:11,020 --> 01:14:13,000
Well, I'm speaking
from my heart.

1480
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:14,500
What about tomorrow, though.

1481
01:14:14,500 --> 01:14:15,900
Or next week, or next year.

1482
01:14:15,900 --> 01:14:17,610
Well, there's no
calendar on my love

1483
01:14:17,610 --> 01:14:18,880
For my daughter, Mrs. Grayson.

1484
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:19,910
You can't just expect her to...

1485
01:14:19,910 --> 01:14:21,690
I don't expect
her to do anything

1486
01:14:21,690 --> 01:14:22,910
Except for to give me a chance.

1487
01:14:28,780 --> 01:14:31,010
I got a new job.

1488
01:14:31,010 --> 01:14:32,810
And we moved to an
apartment that's closer

1489
01:14:32,810 --> 01:14:35,760
To schools, right.

1490
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:37,970
I really hope you
come home, Laura.

1491
01:14:37,970 --> 01:14:40,210
I miss you.

1492
01:14:40,210 --> 01:14:43,910
I miss you, too.

1493
01:14:43,910 --> 01:14:46,840
You know what, we don't
have to decide right now, OK?

1494
01:14:46,840 --> 01:14:48,100
Uh.

1495
01:14:48,100 --> 01:14:50,180
Let's just have our picnic.

1496
01:14:50,180 --> 01:14:53,430
And we can talk about
this more next time.

1497
01:14:53,430 --> 01:14:54,130
OK?

1498
01:14:57,410 --> 01:14:59,720
Mrs. Grayson.

1499
01:14:59,720 --> 01:15:03,200
I made extra.

1500
01:15:03,200 --> 01:15:04,680
No, thank you.

1501
01:15:11,110 --> 01:15:12,710
Hey, hey.

1502
01:15:12,710 --> 01:15:13,700
Hey.

1503
01:15:13,700 --> 01:15:16,180
Hey.

1504
01:15:16,180 --> 01:15:17,660
Ah.

1505
01:15:17,660 --> 01:15:19,640
You OK?

1506
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:22,120
Yeah.

1507
01:15:22,120 --> 01:15:26,260
After what happened to Michael,
I uh... I looked at Laura

1508
01:15:26,260 --> 01:15:28,420
And all I could
think was what might

1509
01:15:28,420 --> 01:15:31,470
Happen if that little
girl goes home.

1510
01:15:31,470 --> 01:15:34,110
And she might.

1511
01:15:34,110 --> 01:15:35,260
We don't have the final say.

1512
01:15:35,260 --> 01:15:36,700
We just have to accept that.

1513
01:15:40,920 --> 01:15:42,600
I can't lose another
one of these kids.

1514
01:15:50,610 --> 01:15:51,770
Right know you
can give Laura what

1515
01:15:51,770 --> 01:15:55,250
I know you give your own
daughter... the conviction

1516
01:15:55,250 --> 01:15:58,520
That she's worthy
of respect and love.

1517
01:16:02,620 --> 01:16:03,310
Yeah.

1518
01:16:06,190 --> 01:16:06,900
Julia.

1519
01:16:06,900 --> 01:16:07,860
Yes?

1520
01:16:07,860 --> 01:16:08,980
Honey, are you down here?

1521
01:16:08,980 --> 01:16:09,680
Yes.

1522
01:16:14,440 --> 01:16:15,820
You OK?

1523
01:16:15,820 --> 01:16:18,030
You checking up on me?

1524
01:16:18,030 --> 01:16:20,070
Just making sure you're safe.

1525
01:16:20,070 --> 01:16:21,520
What's safer than my own house?

1526
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:25,910
Hm.

1527
01:16:25,910 --> 01:16:28,870
So you've been going
through my things.

1528
01:16:28,870 --> 01:16:31,650
Well, kind of.

1529
01:16:31,650 --> 01:16:36,540
Since you showed them to me, I
can't stop thinking about them.

1530
01:16:36,540 --> 01:16:42,030
And this one here, is this
a picture of how he feels?

1531
01:16:42,030 --> 01:16:43,050
Or how it really was?

1532
01:16:46,530 --> 01:16:52,260
Well, this was painted
by a girl, six years old,

1533
01:16:52,260 --> 01:16:54,770
Locked in the basement
most of her life.

1534
01:16:54,770 --> 01:16:56,040
Neighbors didn't
even know she existed

1535
01:16:56,040 --> 01:16:57,740
Until a relative
called child services.

1536
01:17:02,470 --> 01:17:03,860
You really care
about these kids.

1537
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:09,890
Yeah, I do.

1538
01:17:09,890 --> 01:17:14,580
But that doesn't mean I
care any less about you.

1539
01:17:14,580 --> 01:17:15,550
I love you.

1540
01:17:15,550 --> 01:17:17,480
You know that, right?

1541
01:17:17,480 --> 01:17:18,470
I love you, too.

1542
01:17:18,470 --> 01:17:19,850
That's good to hear.

1543
01:17:19,850 --> 01:17:21,850
And you know it's good for both
of us to hear now and then,

1544
01:17:21,850 --> 01:17:23,090
Right?

1545
01:17:23,090 --> 01:17:25,340
Sure is.

1546
01:17:25,340 --> 01:17:27,030
Back to homework.

1547
01:17:27,030 --> 01:17:28,000
Uh, thanks.

1548
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:34,550
These will be pretty.

1549
01:17:34,550 --> 01:17:36,940
I saw you coming out of
the chapel this morning.

1550
01:17:36,940 --> 01:17:42,180
Ah, well, I had some things I
needed to talk over with God.

1551
01:17:42,180 --> 01:17:44,690
Do you think he really listens?

1552
01:17:44,690 --> 01:17:46,220
I think he does.

1553
01:17:46,220 --> 01:17:47,990
Yes.

1554
01:17:47,990 --> 01:17:48,690
Why?

1555
01:17:48,690 --> 01:17:52,910
Is there something you
need to talk over with him?

1556
01:17:52,910 --> 01:17:56,360
I was wondering what God
thought about me going home.

1557
01:17:56,360 --> 01:18:03,240
I mean, I want to trust my
mother, but I'm not sure I can.

1558
01:18:03,240 --> 01:18:05,170
And I need to be
there for my sister.

1559
01:18:09,230 --> 01:18:09,950
Well, you know.

1560
01:18:09,950 --> 01:18:12,610
Those are good
questions to ask God.

1561
01:18:12,610 --> 01:18:15,600
I used to ask my mom
questions all the time.

1562
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:19,200
When I asked about God, she
said he never made mistakes.

1563
01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:21,120
Hmm.

1564
01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:22,600
Then Johnny heard us talking.

1565
01:18:25,100 --> 01:18:30,860
And he said that God made
a mistake when he made me.

1566
01:18:30,860 --> 01:18:32,940
Well, you know,
there's a saying

1567
01:18:32,940 --> 01:18:38,030
My mother used to tell
me, consider the source.

1568
01:18:38,030 --> 01:18:39,320
Yeah.

1569
01:18:39,320 --> 01:18:40,570
Consider the source.

1570
01:18:40,570 --> 01:18:41,270
You got it.

1571
01:19:02,060 --> 01:19:03,600
[CRYING]

1572
01:19:16,540 --> 01:19:19,120
Jacob.

1573
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:22,390
He needs to breathe.

1574
01:19:22,390 --> 01:19:25,800
Hey, what are you
doing out here?

1575
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:29,440
He needs a straw
to breathe through.

1576
01:19:29,440 --> 01:19:32,090
Even then it's... it's hard.

1577
01:19:34,840 --> 01:19:36,550
What are you talking about?

1578
01:19:36,550 --> 01:19:40,520
The baby, the
baby in the ground.

1579
01:19:46,130 --> 01:19:49,670
The baby in the ground.

1580
01:19:49,670 --> 01:19:52,700
Tell me about the baby, Jacob.

1581
01:19:52,700 --> 01:19:59,300
The daddy, he digs a
hole in the backyard.

1582
01:19:59,300 --> 01:20:03,220
And he makes me do it.

1583
01:20:03,220 --> 01:20:08,120
And he was lying down in it.

1584
01:20:11,550 --> 01:20:17,630
He says if he if he screams
he'll be in there longer.

1585
01:20:21,610 --> 01:20:24,840
Well, Mommy, she
gives him a straw

1586
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:28,830
To breathe through and and he

1587
01:20:28,830 --> 01:20:31,740
He fills the hole.

1588
01:20:31,740 --> 01:20:36,050
He woudn't have done it
if he hadn't been bad.

1589
01:20:36,050 --> 01:20:37,550
What's the baby's name, son?

1590
01:20:42,150 --> 01:20:44,030
Jacob.

1591
01:20:44,030 --> 01:20:45,800
[CRYING]

1592
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:46,490
I know.

1593
01:21:03,230 --> 01:21:04,210
Yeah.

1594
01:21:04,210 --> 01:21:06,670
Yeah.

1595
01:21:06,670 --> 01:21:08,140
You're a good kid.

1596
01:21:08,140 --> 01:21:10,110
You're a good kid.

1597
01:21:10,110 --> 01:21:12,070
You're a good kid.

1598
01:21:12,070 --> 01:21:13,540
You're a good kid.

1599
01:21:13,540 --> 01:21:15,020
You're a good kid.

1600
01:21:15,020 --> 01:21:16,980
You're a good kid.

1601
01:21:16,980 --> 01:21:18,940
You're a good kid.

1602
01:21:18,940 --> 01:21:21,900
Good kid, Jacob.

1603
01:21:21,900 --> 01:21:28,580
I'm out late a lot, you
know, out walking my dog.

1604
01:21:28,580 --> 01:21:32,360
Every now and then, I'd see
the lights come on back here.

1605
01:21:32,360 --> 01:21:34,530
Over there, guys.

1606
01:21:34,530 --> 01:21:38,880
I mean, I thought it was a
bit strange being the middle

1607
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:41,330
Of the night and all, but, uh...

1608
01:21:41,330 --> 01:21:43,270
Did you ever anything?

1609
01:21:43,270 --> 01:21:45,400
Like?

1610
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:46,230
Like noises.

1611
01:21:46,230 --> 01:21:47,920
People talking.

1612
01:21:47,920 --> 01:21:49,840
Someone digging.

1613
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:50,560
Digging?

1614
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:51,260
Detective.

1615
01:22:02,850 --> 01:22:05,820
My god.

1616
01:22:05,820 --> 01:22:09,010
What were they doing to him?

1617
01:22:09,010 --> 01:22:11,500
I'm losing my patience
with you, Mr. Aubry.

1618
01:22:11,500 --> 01:22:12,370
I really am.

1619
01:22:12,370 --> 01:22:14,580
Has something happened
we should know about?

1620
01:22:14,580 --> 01:22:15,370
Yes.

1621
01:22:15,370 --> 01:22:18,020
Your case is about
to be reopened.

1622
01:22:18,020 --> 01:22:18,760
Nonsense.

1623
01:22:18,760 --> 01:22:20,790
We can't be tried twice for
the same supposed crimes.

1624
01:22:20,790 --> 01:22:22,220
This is a new
crime, Mr. Fletcher.

1625
01:22:22,220 --> 01:22:23,430
A new crime?

1626
01:22:23,430 --> 01:22:25,750
This time I hope they
throw away the key.

1627
01:22:25,750 --> 01:22:26,760
Bart?

1628
01:22:26,760 --> 01:22:27,470
Relax.

1629
01:22:27,470 --> 01:22:28,210
They found nothing.

1630
01:22:28,210 --> 01:22:29,520
Because there's nothing to find.

1631
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:31,850
I'm here almost
15 years, Fletcher.

1632
01:22:31,850 --> 01:22:33,000
Thought I'd seen it all.

1633
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,130
Whatever Jacob's told
you is all in his head.

1634
01:22:35,130 --> 01:22:36,420
He's always been a liar.

1635
01:22:36,420 --> 01:22:37,750
You know what kind
of trouble he causes.

1636
01:22:37,750 --> 01:22:41,550
What kind of trouble would
make you bury your son alive?

1637
01:22:41,550 --> 01:22:42,410
Oh, my god.

1638
01:22:42,410 --> 01:22:43,920
Not another word.

1639
01:22:43,920 --> 01:22:45,050
You'll be hearing
from me, you and

1640
01:22:45,050 --> 01:22:46,220
This whole damn organization.

1641
01:22:46,220 --> 01:22:48,050
Thanks to this damn
organization, the law

1642
01:22:48,050 --> 01:22:49,780
Sides with kids these days.

1643
01:22:49,780 --> 01:22:50,560
Mr. And Mrs. Fletcher.

1644
01:22:50,560 --> 01:22:52,800
You'll have to come with me.

1645
01:23:05,490 --> 01:23:06,950
It's just beautiful, sweetie.

1646
01:23:06,950 --> 01:23:09,730
It's the first one
she's let me put up.

1647
01:23:15,170 --> 01:23:17,290
I know Johnny hurt you, honey.

1648
01:23:17,290 --> 01:23:22,420
And if there was some way to go
back and take that pain away,

1649
01:23:22,420 --> 01:23:23,120
I would.

1650
01:23:25,830 --> 01:23:28,760
You let him do that to me.

1651
01:23:28,760 --> 01:23:31,190
How does that make you
any better than him?

1652
01:23:31,190 --> 01:23:31,890
It doesn't.

1653
01:23:34,550 --> 01:23:40,250
But I will find some way
to make it up to you.

1654
01:23:40,250 --> 01:23:43,750
I will prove it to you no
matter how long it takes.

1655
01:23:49,030 --> 01:23:49,730
OK.

1656
01:23:52,730 --> 01:23:53,830
I think they're all wonderful.

1657
01:23:53,830 --> 01:23:57,510
Picking a top three, ah...
Which are your favorites?

1658
01:23:57,510 --> 01:23:58,750
Do you like this one?

1659
01:23:58,750 --> 01:23:59,450
Yeah.

1660
01:23:59,450 --> 01:24:01,660
I think you did a great
job with this guy.

1661
01:24:01,660 --> 01:24:02,350
Look at him.

1662
01:24:02,350 --> 01:24:05,740
He's got a pretty fancy hairdo.

1663
01:24:05,740 --> 01:24:06,710
Julia.

1664
01:24:06,710 --> 01:24:08,670
You said this art show
was open to everybody.

1665
01:24:08,670 --> 01:24:11,130
So I thought I'd come
and check it out.

1666
01:24:11,130 --> 01:24:12,060
I'm glad.

1667
01:24:12,060 --> 01:24:14,380
I'm glad you came.

1668
01:24:14,380 --> 01:24:17,010
Listen, I know I've been
kind of a pain lately.

1669
01:24:17,010 --> 01:24:17,710
And...

1670
01:24:17,710 --> 01:24:18,380
Yeah, well.

1671
01:24:18,380 --> 01:24:19,080
You're a teenager.

1672
01:24:19,080 --> 01:24:21,370
It's part of the job
description, right?

1673
01:24:21,370 --> 01:24:22,950
But until the other
night, I didn't even

1674
01:24:22,950 --> 01:24:25,840
Really get what you
were doing here.

1675
01:24:25,840 --> 01:24:27,460
Anyway, um.

1676
01:24:27,460 --> 01:24:29,440
I was thinking maybe
there's some kid

1677
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:30,550
Who could use a friend.

1678
01:24:30,550 --> 01:24:33,090
I could.

1679
01:24:33,090 --> 01:24:34,350
Julia, this is Jacob.

1680
01:24:34,350 --> 01:24:35,930
Jacob, this is my
daughter, Julia.

1681
01:24:35,930 --> 01:24:36,790
Hi.

01:24:36,790 --> 01:24:38,080
Hi.

01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:40,460
You're lucky that you
have such a cool mom.

01:24:40,460 --> 01:24:42,630
Oh, you think?

1685
01:24:42,630 --> 01:24:45,520
So Are any of these
paintings yours?

1686
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:46,330
A couple.

1687
01:24:46,330 --> 01:24:47,200
You want to see?

1688
01:24:47,200 --> 01:24:47,900
Sure.

1689
01:24:47,900 --> 01:24:49,530
Give me the whole tour.

1690
01:24:49,530 --> 01:24:50,680
I'm not very good yet.

01:24:50,680 --> 01:24:55,340
But Annie, I mean Mrs.

miss you more, me or Rusty.

01:25:06,010 --> 01:25:09,260
Or me.

Don't worry.

I'll come back when I can.

want you to leave.

Jacob, you'll be fine.

1704
01:25:16,750 --> 01:25:20,170
And whatever happens,
you'll find a good home.

1705
01:25:20,170 --> 01:25:21,590
I already found a good home.

1706
01:25:21,590 --> 01:25:22,710
It's right here.

1707
01:25:25,500 --> 01:25:26,540
How lucky is that?

1708
01:25:26,540 --> 01:25:29,400
I guess we're both lucky
we found this place.

1709
01:25:36,090 --> 01:25:37,130
I'll keep it forever.

1710
01:25:37,130 --> 01:25:40,460
I might even send you a new
painting if it's good enough.

1711
01:25:40,460 --> 01:25:42,480
What are you talking
about, if it's good enough.

1712
01:25:42,480 --> 01:25:44,640
If it's from you, of course
it'll be good enough.

1713
01:25:44,640 --> 01:25:46,600
Besides, I couldn't let you
leave without a proper goodbye.

1714
01:25:51,940 --> 01:25:54,260
Laura, are you sure about this?

1715
01:25:54,260 --> 01:25:57,550
Going home, I mean.

01:25:57,550 --> 01:25:59,340
No.

1717
01:25:59,340 --> 01:26:03,710
But it's important
to me to try again.

1718
01:26:03,710 --> 01:26:05,480
Then It's important to me, too.

1719
