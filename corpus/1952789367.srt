[ woman ]
dirt-box.

26
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,040
You should've washed once
in the last ten years.
Washing's overrated.

27
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,360
I'm trusting you, Colm.
It's me getting you in.

28
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,280
Just 'cause
you can't hold a job.

29
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:33,080
Hurts.  Hurtin'.
It was strings
I was pullin'.

30
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,680
They've already
a barber.
But I'm Mr. Skills.

31
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:39,720
You've to make me look good.
It's both of us
work there now.

32
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,320
Need a hand holdin'
him down, Bronagh ?
I can handle him.

33
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,240
Thanks for the sandwiches,
Mrs. O’Neill.

34
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,680
You're always
welcome here, Bronagh.

35
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,440
It's disgusting
in there.
Squeezing blackheads ?

36
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,360
It's just so erotic.

37
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,920
[ Bronagh ]
there's only five
of us now, including you.

38
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,880
Only five what ?
Only five catholics.

39
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,320
In the whole nuthouse ?
Aye.  Working.

40
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,720
All the patients
are almost all catholic.

41
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,360
Right.  He's in there.

42
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,840
You're on your
best behavior, you hear ?

43
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,040
Meep-meep !
Sadistic.
Masochistic.

44
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,280
Oh !

45
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,520
The new catholic.

46
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,680
- The new barber.
- I'm only slaggin'.

47
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,640
I'll do the honors.

48
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,840
You'll have
no problem remembering.
We're all billys.

49
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,080
<i>- Billy Jewel.

50
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,120

<i>- How are ya ?

00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,560

- Billy.

55
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:07,520
I'm Billy King.
They call me King Billy.
No offense.

56
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:11,800
- None taken.
You're the boss man ?
- That's debatable.

57
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,920
All right, Colm.

58
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,720
The other fella's,
uh, a good fella.

59
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,120
Protestant fella.

60
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,520
Do you like poetry ?

61
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:27,480
Not really.
Whatever you do,
don't mention poetry.

62
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:32,000
He's into poetry.
He's the pain
in the rectum.

63
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,240
So, you're
into poetry ?

64
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:38,040
Do you like poetry ?

65
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:41,320
Sure, I guess.
My granny wrote a bit.

66
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:45,080
Your granny ?
Was she ever published ?

67
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,600
<i>She had a poem
in the telegraph
when she died.</i>

68
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,080
What was the subject ?

69
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,320
<i>It was weird.  It was
something to do with your
woman from the Wizard of Oz.</i>

70
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,880
Judy Garland.
I love her.
Aye, her.

71
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,720
Well, she's all right.
Like, yeah.

72
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,000
Oh, was it an ode ?
Or was she into
Judy Garland ?

73
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,520
She liked her like,
yeah.

74
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,480
That's fantastic.

75
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:24,760
His name was Colm,
the hairdressing man.

76
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:28,360
His granny had a poem
in the telly.

77
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,640
Felly-welly...

78
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,080
Had a jelly
old belly...

79
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,760
For the mother
of Liza Minnelli.

80
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,840
That's very good there.
Bit of a talent.

81
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,720
Come in handy
with the ladies ?

82
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,120
From the mountain
of mourne to hades.

83
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,240
You should be drivin'
a Mercedes.

84
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,960
I'd like to borrow
Warren Beatty’s.

85
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,480
1980s--

86
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,760
Euphrates.

87
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:19,280
Right.  Where do you
want him, boys ?

88
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,880
Why don't you
take him, Colm ?
[ speaking, indistinct ]

89
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:26,040
Up you go.
Get you all cleaned up.

90
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,120
I'll just be sitting
over here waiting
for ya, all right ?

91
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,120
Hello there, sir.

92
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,600
You know,
I've been meaning
to ask somebody.

93
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,200
Do you know where they're
holding the Eurovision
song contest this year ?

94
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,680
'cause I've been
hearing Helsinki--
[ yelling ]

95
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,680
Derrick.

96
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,400
Derrick !

97
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,840
Put the man down,
Derrick !

98
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:56,600
<i>Right.   Right.
So--  clear !</i>

99
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,760
[ electrical static ]
[ groans ]

100
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,320
It's just a bit off
the back and sides.

101
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,320
[ George ]  so we're chasing
this wee bastard up the road.
[ Colm ]  the joyrider ?

102
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,960
Right.
He's doing about 80
up the Shan kill Road.

103
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,360
In your cousin's car ?
Aye,
the thievin' git.

104
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,320
Were you driving ?
My cousin was driving,
but it was my car, like.

105
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,760
Your cousin's
drivin' your escort and
the skinhead's drivin' his car.

106
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,600
My cousin's car.
Right.  Next !

107
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,440
So, he whips it up
this street.

108
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:29,120
Me and my cousin
in hot pursuit.

109
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,360
And I'm telling my cousin
to give it up and
he's not listening.

110
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:35,480
He's like a demon.
So the kid's making
a beeline up the mountain.

111
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:38,000
Up to the racetrack.
Have you ever driven
on that road ?

112
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,640
Aye, sort of it.
It's a racetrack.
The road's so smooth.

113
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,960
It's a fuckin' racetrack.
It's a road and a fuckin'
racetrack.

114
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,240
You can drive on it,
even if you're not
in a race.

115
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:49,720
Precisely.
So we're still right up
his arse, right ?

116
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,200
In my car.
And we go faster and faster...

117
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,560
Till we're fuckin' flyin'.

118
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,800
And the car starts
to shake and shudder.

119
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:01,040
It was not meant
for high-speed pursuit,
the ford escort.

120
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,080
And I feel
the fuckin' g-forces
stretchin' me cheeks...

121
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,720
Like a fuckin' astronaut.
Jesus.

122
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,760
Like I'm frozen
to the seat in terror.
Jesus.

123
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:14,160
And I look over
at the speedometer,
and it says...

124
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,480
A hundred and ninety.

125
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,080
A hundred and ninety ?
A hundred and ninety.

126
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,240
- Would you fuck off.
A hundred and ninety ?
- I swear to God.  190.

127
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,800
In an escort ?
In an escort.

128
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,520
All right.
It's 4:00 in the morning,
it's Christmas Eve,

129
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,320
And I'm chasing some kid
around a fuckin' racetrack
at a hundred and ninety.

130
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,240
In an escort ?
In an escort.

131
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,320
Did you catch him ?

132
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,760
The engine blew up.
He died ?

133
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,680
<i>No, our engine blew up.
You're kidding.</i>

134
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:43,160
I hadn't put oil in it.
And it blew up ?

135
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:47,120
I'm not a handyman.
The joyrider got away ?

136
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,200
The engine exploded.
The lesson was taught.

137
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:52,360
It hadn't seen oil
since the day it was bought.

138
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,440
- Seven years.
- You didn't put oil
in it for seven years.

139
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,960
I forgot.
I'm not a handyman.

140
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:03,760
Your cousin
pissed off ?
Second degree burns.

141
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,800
He was burnt ?
Face, neck and hands.

142
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,920
Were you burnt ?
Not a scratch.

143
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,880
Jesus.
He hasn't spoken
to me since.

144
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,760
Jesus.
We were very close,
him and I.

145
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:17,520
Was he scarred ?
Holy fuck.
A bit, aye.

146
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,800
Did they find his car ?
Aye, the next day.

147
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:22,200
Was nothing wrong
with the car ?
There was one thing.

148
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,120
Stolen.
His radio ?

149
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:28,120
No.  All his
Elton John tapes
were missing.

150
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:33,520
Quite a collection.
The bastard stole all
of his Elton John tapes.

151
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,760
He's fantastic.

152
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,920
Elton John ?
Aye.

153
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,360
Fuckin' genius.

154
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,200
[ man ]
(music) oh, Ruby (music)

155
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:53,520
(music) oh, Ruby (music)

156
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:58,520
(music) Don't take your love
to time (music)

157
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,360
The scalper.

158
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,360
What are you
going on about ?
Your man ?

159
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:07,320
The fresh nutter.
The scalper.

160
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,480
What, like getting
tickets to a concert ?

161
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:12,880
No, like a real scalper.
He flipped.

162
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,560
He literally scalped
four people.

163
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:22,040
- Jesus Christ.
- Some hairpiece fella.

164
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:26,000
Had enough.
Started scalping
some of his customers.

165
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,400
Did you ever scalp
a man, George ?

166
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,720
[ George ]  hairpieces ?
[ orderly ]
he had the only company.

167
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:43,600
- What, like a monopoly ?
- No.  Just him.

168
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,600
He had the only
hairpiece company
in all of Northern Ireland.

169
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,920
- In all of Northern Ireland ?
- In all of northern Ireland.

170
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,400
- Who has it now ?
- Nobody.

171
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,560
Well, how would somebody
go about contacting...

172
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,240
All those, you know,
unserviced baldies ?

173
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:01,080
- He has a list.
- A list ?
- He keeps it in his bible.

174
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:06,240
I'm after having an idea.
An epiphany.

175
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,680
[ Colm ]
some Scottish fella.
He was into the hairpieces.

176
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:22,000
He threw a wobbler, started
scalping his customers.
[ Bronagh ]  Jesus.

177
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:25,840
He was the only
hairpiece fella
in all of northern Ireland.

178
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,440
He was loaded.
Fucker had two jacuzzis.

179
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:31,520
Two ?
Aye.  The wee ones.
One for each foot.

180
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,440
And you wanna go in
on it with George ?
Aye.

181
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:38,680
You butter the catholics,
George the protestants.
Sounds good.

182
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,600
Nonsectarian-like.
Pacifists.

183
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,840
Pacifists make good money.
You ever heard
of a broke pacifist ?

184
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,760
Exactly.

185
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,760
And what about
the nuthouse ?

186
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,480
I've had it up to here
with that place.
Oh, Colm.

187
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:55,240
What ?
You've only been
working there
for two days.

188
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,520
On to bigger
and better things, baby.

189
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:00,120
There's only one thing
I'm not looking forward to.
What's that ?

190
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,200
We're gonna have
to talk to the scalper.

191
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,920
Dim the light.

192
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,160
You not frightened ?

193
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,240
Are you not in it
above your heads ?

194
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:33,840
You think
I was predisposed.
[ grunts ]

195
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,920
A genetic inevitable.
What ?

196
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,440
A nutter...

197
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:45,520
Waiting for the one word
that'll set him off.

198
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,960
What ?

199
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,280
Ah, you've balls.
You pity me.

200
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,360
You greedy little children...

201
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,840
Want to survive.

202
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:58,520
<i>You greedy,
sad little children,</i>

203
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,480
You want to triumph.

204
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,480
[ coughing ]

205
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:08,120
I swallowed a fly.
Done it before.

206
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,800
Full of protein.

207
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,400
<i>Six legs, four wings
and eighteen eyes.</i>

208
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,120
But I beat the fucker.

209
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:26,080
Did you ever read
saint Paul's letter
to the hermaphrodites ?

210
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,240
It says,

211
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,880
"dear hermaphrodites,

212
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:34,240
"go fuck yourselves.

213
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,600
"yours sincerely,

214
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,560
Saint Paul."

215
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,160
You dare...

216
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:48,200
Strut through
the valley of death ?

217
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,280
Where's your fear
of the venal ?

218
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,320
Where's your sense
of Christianity,

219
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,600
You greedy,
sad little children ?

220
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:00,080
You want the list ?
The names ?

221
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,360
The cash ?
The triumph ?  Answer !

222
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,560
- Yes.
- Yes ?

223
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,760
Y-yes.

224
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,560
One reason why.

225
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:19,040
One reason why.

226
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:24,320
It's yours if...

227
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,960
Your answer pleases me.

228
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,800
Must be very clever.
What ?

229
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,960
Why you ?

230
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,000
Why ?

231
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,360
We're bored ?

232
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,960
What ?

233
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:52,160
What the fuck's
a hermaphrodite ?
I think
I'm after soiling myself.

234
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:39,400
[ Colm ]  the scalper
gave us his franchise
for wigs of Wimbledon.

235
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:43,000
We're the only
hairpiece company
in all of Northern Ireland.

236
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:46,880
[ George ]
we've a monopoly on hairpieces.
[ woman ]  that's dead on.

237
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,840
Was your man an Indian ?
He's doing
very well.

238
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:52,720
Sit still,
kemosabe.

239
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:55,760
What page are we on ?
One.

240
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,960
He had a Volvo
and a house on
the Malone road.

241
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,040
We've
his client list.
A Volvo ?

242
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,840
<i>I love Volvos.
Are those good ?
Aye.</i>

243
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,720
<i>Did youse get
to see the scalps ?</i>

244
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,400
It says you have to twist.
You have to twist this around.

245
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:12,480
- What do you mean, twist ?
- Twist.
- Cut off his circulation.

246
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,440
That's too tight.
Slobber up.

247
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,760
- Did you hear the name ?
- The what ?
- [ Colm ]  name of the company.

248
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:20,240
Is it good ?
Bronagh came up
with it.

249
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,200
- He's a prod.
- Who's "he" ?

250
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,800
[ Colm ]
George is a protestant.
[ George ]  it's good.

251
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,680
<i>- [ Colm ]

 - I know that, son.</i>

252

00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:41,360
It's very good.
[ Colm ]
The Piece People.

256
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:45,000
You were always
the clever one, Bronagh.

257
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,080
It's for the nicotine,
George.

258
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,120
[ Colm ]
it stains her hair.

259
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:54,320
The knickers act
like a buffer.
From the nicotine.

260
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,040
It's just knickers,
George.

261
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,320
Aye.

262
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,320
There's no highfalutin
here, George.

263
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,000
Was this
on somebody's head ?

264
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,160
<i>[ George ]
it's just a sample.
[ Colm ]  it's just for show.</i>

265
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:12,080
<i>Does it fit anybody, like ?
It fits nobody here.
Come here.  Give me that.</i>

266
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,600
Jesus.  Fuck me.
Oh, sorry, Mrs. O’Neill.

267
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:18,440
<i>George, this
is in the back.</i>

268
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,960
"our all-natural toupees

Where all the profits
go to the church."

274
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,840
Ah, Jesus.

275
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,240
- The Roman catholic church.
- Nun hair.  That's a gas.

00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:51,040
- You still in it, George ?
- I'm not so sure about it now.

278
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:55,360
You're gonna be
spending eternity in hell
with us catholics now, George.

279
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,960
What are we forgetting ?

280
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Cellophane ?
Check.

281
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:31,240
Sticky tape ?
Double-sided.

Marker ?
What else ?
Marker.

283
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:39,000
I think that's it.
Are we forgetting something ?

284
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:41,160
It feels like
we're forgetting something.

285
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:44,440
Will I do the taping
and the writing ?
Aye, and I'll do the twisting.

286
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,080
Right.
Right.

287
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,320
Right.

Look, I'm proud of youse.
But what are you
bothering me for ?

297
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,640
We're here for
the hairpiece demonstration.

298
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:39,680
Is this some sort
of government thing ?
No, sir.

299
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,400
'cause I don't know
who you've been talking to,
but she's a fuckin' liar.

300
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,040
- Who's a liar ?
- I'm a good Christian man.

301
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,680
A man who's avoided
the sins of the flesh.
That's great.

302
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:51,040
- My body is a temple.
- Could we come inside, sir ?

303
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,480
I don't know
who you've been talking to,
but she's a fuckin' liar.

304
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:56,440
- You'll find
no herpes here.
- Herpes ?

305
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:01,360
Isn't that
what you said ?
No, sir.  Hairpieces.

306
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,560
Oh.

307
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:06,440
Thought you said herpes.
No, sir.

308
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:10,080
No.
So, what do you want ?

309
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,480
We're with
the hairpieces.

310
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,680
Okay.

311
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:18,680
You had an appointment
for a hairpiece.

312
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,720
You've

I don't think so.

313
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:25,440
- I think so.
- It says 137 Dunmurry Lane.

314
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:28,200
But I've no appointment.
I think I don't.
I think you do.

315
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:31,200
- Are you Mr. Black ?
- Who wants to know ?

316
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,560
We have an appointment
with a Mr. Black.
Is that you ?

317
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:36,000
- Maybe, but I've
no fucking appointment.
- You fucking do.

318
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,960
- I fucking don't !
- Have you ever considered
getting one ?

319
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,840
- What ?  A hairpiece ?
- Yes.

320
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:44,000
- Like this one.
- Would you come in with that ?

321
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:55,920
As a matter of fact,
I have considered it, actually.

322
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,040
Sheds years
off your appearance.

323

Here.
Give us a go, Will ya ?

324
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,160
Yeah.

325
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:24,000
That's dead on.

326
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,520
Ah, shit.
You know what ?
What ?

327
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,840
I can't take this.
It needs            why not ?
The sticky tape.

328
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,360
No, it's nice and all,
but, uh, see, my part's

from a bad person.

815
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:26,160
Oh, Jesus, no, vicar.

816
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:29,480
This is 100 percent
genuine, guaranteed
protestant hair.

817
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:32,360
Grown, no less,
by 100 percent
protestant Dutch people.

818
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:35,120
Are you sure ?
Sure.
Look at it yourself.

819
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:39,000
Does that look like
dirty, mangy, smelly
catholic monkey hair to you ?

820
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:41,160
That is a fine head
of protestant hair.

821
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:45,000
- It looks good.
- None but the best.

822
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:51,280
- Top of the line ?
- None finer.

823
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:53,760
And the synthetic hair
is cheaper ?

824
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:56,160
It is, yes.
But you get
what you pay for.

825
00:53:56,200 --> 00:54:00,520
I really would recommend
the natural hair myself.
Top of the line.

826
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:15,880

[ train whistle blowing ]

828
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:36,200
[ man ]  this just in.
Another bombing attempt
has been made tonight...

829
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:39,440
On a stretch of railway track
two Miles east of kurgan.

830
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:43,680
Trains were delayed for an hour
while the army bomb squad
diffused the explosives.

831
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:46,800
There were no injuries.
The provisional I.R.A.
Are suspected,

832
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:49,760
Though no one
has claimed responsibility
at this stage.

833
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:52,120
Trains have resumed
a regular schedule.

834
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:54,200
The I.U.C. Have found
evidence on the scene...

835
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:58,240
Which they Hope
Will lead to the capture
of those involved.

836
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:01,520
And finally,
passing Christmas shoppers
got a treat today...

837
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:05,360
When Santa chose
an unusual mode of transport
to arrive in time.

838
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:07,800
Oh, Jesus !

839
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:09,840
You're all right.

840
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:15,200
Oh, Jesus !
You're all right.
Get them next time.

841
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:18,160
Was I bald
when I came in here ?

842
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:23,360
What ?
Was I bald
when I came in here ?

843
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:25,840
Was I wearing my--

844
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:30,280
Was I wearing my wig ?

845
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:33,240
Um... No.

846
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:38,280
Oh, Jesus !
What's wrong ?

847
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:40,800
I wore it on the job.
It must have came off
on the job.

848
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:43,000
The wig ?
Aye.

849
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:44,960
Will we go back and get it ?

850
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:47,760
We can't go back and get it.
The brats are already there,
ya dick.

851
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:50,480
Why didn't you
say something ?
Say what ?

852
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:52,440
You know
I wear the wig every day.

853
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:54,480
You know I never
leave the house without it.
Why didn't you--

854
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:57,600
Why didn't you
fucking tell me ?
I figured it was...

855
00:55:57,680 --> 00:56:00,240
Laundry night or something.

856
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:08,080
Good morning.
Toupee or not toupee.
What is your question ?

857
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:10,560
They're sold
all over the world, sir.
All over the world.

[ man ]

859
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:15,120
Why are they
selling more wigs ?
I don't know.

860
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:17,480
What is it about
toupee or not toupee ?

861
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:19,920
I don't know.
They're just selling
more wigs than us.

862
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:22,080
Do you want to win
this competition ?
Yes.

863
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:24,040
How do the sell them ?
What do you mean ?

864
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:27,320
What's their angle ?
Do they dress up
in chicken suits ?

865
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:30,200
You're making me nervous.
They talk a good sell,
I suppose.

866
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:32,560
Smooth-talking
bastards.
And you's are hopeless ?

867
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:35,160
We've done very well.
Yes, I know you have, dear.

868
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:37,320
It's all been
an enlightening experience.

869
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:39,240
But you'll get beat
in this competition thing...

870
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:42,360
If we don't start
selling more wigs pronto.
I know that.

871
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:45,360
Right.  You've
ten days to the cutoff.
It's time to knuckle down.

872
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:47,480
I have an idea.
God help us.

873
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:49,880
An angle.
A scheme.
Go ahead.

874
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:52,440
What sort of scheme ?
A sure-fine scheme.

875
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:57,360
Now go in there,
stop your blathering,
sit down and shut up.

<i>[ Bronagh ]

You can taste it.
I know that feeling.

878
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:05,560
Right.
And you've
said all the crap.

879
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:09,200
All the crap you say.
But he still won't bite.
He won't commit.

<i>I know what you're saying.
You're losing him.</i>

881
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:13,080
He wants it.
But his wife
Will blow a curler.

882
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:15,280
- The henpecked fucker.
- This is where we blow it.

883

You're standing there.
It's time for something drastic.

You tip your wigs.

of your heads like a monk,

And then
we'll fit two cracker,

- [ Bronagh ]  how do you

- What are you looking at ?

- There's nothing

- You're the sample.

Maybe.
But it's a stock model.
But you would recognize ?

whether it was curly or not.

Sometimes
it don't match.
What's that ?

925
00:59:57,600 --> 01:00:01,120
- Sometimes we're in a rush.
- You won't put a curly-haired
wig on a straight-haired man.

We might.
If we could
get away with it.

then he gets
a cheapo deal.

- The cheapo wig.
- But he'd look the right heel.

That rhymed.
So it did.

This wig
has been chewed up by dogs.
Do you have a dog ?

No.
What about you ?

- I hate dogs.
- This wig
could have been changed.

933
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:24,520
Could have been dyed a different
color.  Did you sell a similar
model of a different color ?

- Well, that's it.
- This is a sample wig ?

<i>Uh, maybe.
You've never sold

And if, at that point,
you still can't recall,

952
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:18,640
I'm going to insist
you give me every receipt,
every order form,

Every bank statement

You two freaks

From Bangor
to San Francisco.

See if
I can't make a match.
Match it to his head.

958
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:37,160
Match it to the color of dye
in this wig.

See if I can't find
my little Cinderella.

I'm good at what I do,

That a dog ate it.

964
01:02:27,040 --> 01:02:30,720
I got it back
and threw it in the car.
It's a long story.

You're a bollocks, Colm.
How am I a bollocks ?

966
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:36,280
You shouldn't
have sold it to him.

967
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:39,760
I heard no complaints
at the time.
Why didn't you say something ?

968
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:41,880
Look,
there's no Trace of it.

969
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:43,800
It's a sample.
There's no order form
or anything.

970

You should

I need more time.

1127
01:13:55,240 --> 01:13:57,320
What,
to order some wigs ?

1128
01:13:57,360 --> 01:13:59,520
My partner's protestant.

1129
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:02,560
Did you tell him ?
Lucky you.
No.

1130
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:04,640
But he wouldn't
be into it if I did.

1131
01:14:04,720 --> 01:14:07,880
There you go, mate.
Cheers.  Thank you.

1132
01:14:12,320 --> 01:14:14,440
Grub's up.

1133
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:18,680
Where's my change ?

1134
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:34,600
It's not as good
as colonel sanders.
God bless the colonel.

1135
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:37,720
It's not as good.
Nah.

1136
01:14:38,680 --> 01:14:40,560
Do you like breast, Colm ?

1137
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:44,240
Why, sure.
Fuck, now that's
actually tasty.

1138
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:48,480
Nowhere near as good
as the colonel's
secret recipe though.

1139
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:52,600
With 21 spices.
11.
11.

1140
01:14:52,680 --> 01:14:57,320
Do you know, in the--
in the Kentucky fried chicken
headquarters,

1141
01:14:57,360 --> 01:15:00,400
The Kentucky fried chicken
headquarters in Louisiana,

1142
01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:02,840
Or wherever
the fuck Kentucky is,

1143
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:06,880
They've got round-the-clock
security guarding that recipe
with their fucking lives.

1144
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:09,600
Like the coke recipe.
Top secret.

1145
01:15:09,680 --> 01:15:12,520
Anyone tries
to knock that recipe, bang !

1146
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:14,720
Colm here
needs more time.

1147
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:17,720
Why ?
He's not sure.

1148
01:15:17,800 --> 01:15:20,360
He's tentative ?
He is tentative.

1149
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:23,560
He needs time
to arrange our capture
with the armed forces.

1150
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:28,000
I wouldn't do that.
This protestant fella,
who is he ?

1151
01:15:28,080 --> 01:15:30,040
[ clears throat ]
he's my partner.

1152
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:32,000
Is he your boss ?
No.

1153
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:33,880
Is he the one
does all the thinking ?
Nope.

1154
01:15:33,960 --> 01:15:36,000
Are you
your own man or what ?
I am my own man.

1155
01:15:36,080 --> 01:15:39,120
I just need to think
things out a bit, you know ?

1156
01:15:39,160 --> 01:15:41,160
Are you
too good for us ?

1157
01:15:41,240 --> 01:15:43,800
Listen, uh...

1158
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:48,160
I'll sell you
the wigs individually.
You know, one at a time.

1159
01:15:48,240 --> 01:15:50,320
He's a Brit.
I'm not a Brit.

1160
01:15:50,360 --> 01:15:52,400
- You're a Brit.
- I'm not a Brit.

1161
01:15:52,440 --> 01:15:55,840
Do you believe
in the united Ireland ?
I do believe.

1162
01:15:55,920 --> 01:15:59,240
I just don't want to be
the official wig supplier
for the Irish republican army.

1163
01:15:59,320 --> 01:16:01,520
Keep your fucking voice down.
I'm sorry.
My partner's a protestant.

1164
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:04,800
- I guess we know
what side you're on.
- You don't know.

1165
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:08,080
I told you.
I'll sell you the wigs
individually, as just people.

1166
01:16:08,120 --> 01:16:11,520
That's it.
Not to an army.
Just as people.

1167
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:14,920
Don't tell me
you know what side I'm on.
You know nothing about me.

1168
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,480
I'm just trying
to fucking survive here.

1169
01:16:20,920 --> 01:16:23,120
That's very good that.

1170
01:16:23,160 --> 01:16:26,400
Very, uh...
Very dramatic.

1171
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:28,280
You should
get an Oscar for that.

1172
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:31,600
You know what, son ?
What ?

1173
01:16:31,640 --> 01:16:34,160
Take down
that number there, you.

1174
01:16:36,080 --> 01:16:38,040
<i>You're not the only
game in town, you know ?</i>

1175
01:16:38,080 --> 01:16:41,720
We just want some wigs.
Not a political dissertation.

1176
01:16:41,800 --> 01:16:44,200
We'll go to them fellas.
See them fellas.

1177
01:16:44,280 --> 01:16:46,520
See if they
want to take our money.

1178
01:16:47,480 --> 01:16:50,120
Trying to survive.
You're a fruit.

1179
01:16:57,560 --> 01:16:59,720
Do you think
we're doing this for fun ?

1180
01:16:59,800 --> 01:17:04,400
For a bit
of a fucking laugh ?
I want more than that.

1181
01:17:04,440 --> 01:17:06,640
More than what ?

1182
01:17:07,560 --> 01:17:10,160
I want more
than to just survive.

1183
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:15,800
<i>Come on.
We'll call that number.</i>

1184
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:42,600
[ man ]
take me back.

1185
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:45,720
Take me
way, way, way back...

1186
01:17:48,280 --> 01:17:51,120
On Hanford street,

1187
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:53,960
Where you could
feel the silence
at half past 11:00...

1188
01:17:54,040 --> 01:17:56,320
On long Summer nights...

1189
01:17:56,400 --> 01:17:59,840
As the wireless
played radio Luxembourg...

1190
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:02,600
And the voices whispered
across beech River...

1191
01:18:04,960 --> 01:18:10,160
In the quietness as we sank
into restful slumber
in the silence...

1192
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:14,280
And carried on
dreaming in God.

1193
01:18:24,040 --> 01:18:26,960
In walks up cherry valley
from Northroad Bridge,

1194
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:30,480
View while lying
on sunny Summer afternoons.

1195
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:32,920
Picking apples
from the side of the tracks...

1196
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:37,320
That spilled over
from the gardens of the houses
on Cyprus Avenue.

1197
01:18:37,400 --> 01:18:41,680
Watching the moth catcher
worked the floodlights
in the evenings...

1198
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:44,280
And meeting
down by the pylons.

1199
01:18:46,440 --> 01:18:48,600
Playing around
Mrs. Kelly's lamp.

1200
01:18:48,680 --> 01:18:50,800
Going out
to Hollywood on the bus...

1201
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:54,440
And walking
from the end of the lines
to the seaside.

1202
01:18:54,520 --> 01:18:57,120
Stopping at Fuscos
for ice cream...

1203
01:18:57,160 --> 01:18:59,680
In the days
before rock 'n' roll.

1204
01:19:06,760 --> 01:19:08,920
Hanford street,

1205
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:12,000
A bed of red,
orange food,

1206
01:19:12,040 --> 01:19:16,000
Saint donor’s church,
Sunday six bells.

1207
01:19:17,360 --> 01:19:19,480
[ George speaking

I'm not doing the deal.

That was lovely.

- Have a drink ?

1236
01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:09,360
How many wigs
are we behind ?

1237

I don't know,
but at least 30.

1238

Thirty ?

1239

Well, let's say 45
to be on the safe side.

1240
01:21:17,320 --> 01:21:19,680
You've got four days
until Christmas.

1241

I guess that's the end
of The Piece People.
It ain't looking good.

1242
01:21:23,440 --> 01:21:27,640
[ Bronagh ]  well, let's
get our thinking caps on
and start thinking then.

1243
01:21:30,080 --> 01:21:33,320
Think of a large
group of people
who are all bald.

1244
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:37,320
I'm so stupid.
Listen, I got a mate
from school.  He's a chemist.

1245
01:21:37,360 --> 01:21:39,280
We could get him
to make us up a batch
of some shit...

1246
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:41,200
That, like,
makes your hair fall out.

1247
01:21:41,240 --> 01:21:43,120
We could dump it
in the drinking water.

1248
01:21:43,200 --> 01:21:46,840
- Two pints of lager
and a pint of Guinness.
- Dump it in the reservoir.

1249
01:21:46,920 --> 01:21:49,440
There must be
some large group of people
who are all bald.

1250
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:51,440
There must be.

1251
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:53,480
Cancer victims.

1252
01:21:55,520 --> 01:21:59,080
People with cancer.
You're
a sick fuck, Colm.

1253
01:21:59,160 --> 01:22:01,200
They need the wigs
with the chemo.

1254
01:22:01,280 --> 01:22:05,160
Or how about people
that live near
nuclear power plants ?

1255
01:22:05,240 --> 01:22:07,920
You're a sick fuck.
Something simple.

1256
01:22:08,920 --> 01:22:11,160
Chemo.
Frig sake.

Hey, George,
here's to you.
Cheers.

Oh, sorry.

cheers, guys.
Well done.

01:22:21,440 --> 01:22:23,560
Great poem.
Oh, thanks.

1261
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:26,600
Mm.  What's
that thing called ?

1262
01:22:26,680 --> 01:22:29,920
You know,
when people have stress
and all the hair falls out ?

1263
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,200
It's, um--
it's apecia or something.

1264
01:22:32,280 --> 01:22:34,680
I heard of that.
It's apecia or deplecia.

1265
01:22:34,760 --> 01:22:37,960
But your hair falls out ?
Mm.  'cause of stress.

1266
01:22:38,040 --> 01:22:41,160
What, the people pull it out
because of the stress ?
It falls out.

1267
01:22:41,240 --> 01:22:43,200
No, they don't--
they don't pull it out.
It falls out.  Exactly.

1268
01:22:43,280 --> 01:22:46,840
Let's take a seat.
It's either apecia
or deplecia.

1269
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:49,360
I saw a show
on that once.
What, on apecia ?

1270
01:22:49,400 --> 01:22:51,400
Must be
a lot of it here.

1271
01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:54,400
Applepecia.

1272
01:22:54,480 --> 01:22:58,080
No.  It's not applepecia.
That doesn't sound right.

1273
01:22:58,160 --> 01:23:01,880
But your hair
definitely falls out,
like in clumps.

1274
01:23:01,960 --> 01:23:05,800
Clumps.  I'm liking
the sound of that.  Clumps.

1275
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:08,080
Do you know anybody
at the department of health ?

1276
01:23:08,120 --> 01:23:09,960
What,
like a government thing ?

1277
01:23:10,040 --> 01:23:12,600
Aye.  Can you
get at any records ?
Talk your way in ?

1278
01:23:14,520 --> 01:23:16,920
Is the pope catholic ?

1279
01:24:03,080 --> 01:24:05,040
Help me, God.

1280
01:24:06,040 --> 01:24:08,000
Send me a sign.

1281
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:11,480
Send me my Cinderella.

1282
01:24:14,520 --> 01:24:17,120
Give me a sign.

1283
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:35,200
Oh, my God !

1284
01:25:15,680 --> 01:25:18,680
[ ticking ]
[ Colm ]  so what's
going to happen at 4:00 ?

1285
01:25:18,760 --> 01:25:23,800
At 4:00, the phone's
going to ring.
I Hope.

1286
01:25:23,880 --> 01:25:26,960
[ Colm ]
who's going to ring ?

1287
01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:30,040
Never you mind.

Colonel.
Nice to meet you.
Bronagh.  Hello.

1316
01:28:35,720 --> 01:28:40,080
It's a very simple procedure.
It's basically myself
and George and Colm over here.

1317

And, um,

With what ?

1322
01:28:54,520 --> 01:28:57,280
Selling wigs to the brats.

1323
01:28:57,360 --> 01:28:59,320
No.

1324
01:29:00,400 --> 01:29:03,920
It's a gesture.
What do you mean ?

1325
01:29:03,960 --> 01:29:08,240
If you sold wigs to them,
that would be wrong.

1326
01:29:08,280 --> 01:29:12,040
If I say okay,
it's a gesture.

1327
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:16,040
I don't understand.

1328
01:29:17,040 --> 01:29:21,200
You see,
I can make a gesture...

1329
01:29:21,240 --> 01:29:26,000
Because the only way
to stop the cycle...

1330
01:29:26,040 --> 01:29:28,400
Is if I,
a catholic,

1331
01:29:30,160 --> 01:29:32,120
Can forgive...

1332
01:29:33,280 --> 01:29:35,240
That you're a protestant.

1333
01:29:36,880 --> 01:29:39,960
It's a gesture.
Why not me, a protestant ?

1334
01:29:41,400 --> 01:29:43,800
I'm having epiphany.

1335
01:29:43,880 --> 01:29:46,600
You can't make a gesture,
but I can make a gesture.

1336
01:29:46,680 --> 01:29:49,880
I can reciprocate.
No.
After, but not first.

Why can't I ?

1338
01:29:51,920 --> 01:29:54,840
At this point, you
can't make the gesture.  Only
a catholic can make the gesture.

1339
01:29:54,880 --> 01:29:56,720
Why can only a catholic
make the gesture ?

1340
01:29:56,800 --> 01:29:58,760
Because we're in the right
and you're in the wrong.
What ?

1341
01:29:58,840 --> 01:30:01,840
And therefore,
I'm making the gesture.
You're right and we're wrong ?

1342
01:30:01,920 --> 01:30:03,760
Correct.
I think
it's a tad grayer than that.

01:30:03,840 --> 01:30:05,680
It's black and white.
I'm making the gesture.

1344
01:30:05,760 --> 01:30:08,640
What if I said I was right
and you were wrong ?
You'd be fucking wrong.
