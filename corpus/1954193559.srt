Fuck you. You don't know my head.

- What's that? A hand grenade?

00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,809
- Hair of the dog.
- That dog shat on my soul.

Drink it. It's mother's
little helper.

I'm dying. I'm gonna
die on this train.

I've been sent by Monsieur
Fontaine. Follow me.

Dom, don't think what

That's Mr Fontaine's property.

- Fit to fiddle, I'd say.

No, I don't, Ivan.

I only use a gun to
hold up a place,

00:17:15,625 --> 00:17:18,695
or threaten someone, or rob 'em,

234

Rabbits are pets. I don't eat pets.

Oh, these French rabbits are
something else, though, Dom.

The art, the house.

294
00:20:37,917 --> 00:20:41,957
Or estate. This is an estate, right?
That's what they call it. It's very nice.

295

I appreciate it.

It's OK.

I could have said Ivana Anatoli
Fontaine was the leader of the group.

306
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:26,666
Maybe you are tired
from your trip, Dom?

307
00:21:26,667 --> 00:21:29,749

I sat in that tiny cell

- I'm sorry, Dom...

312
00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:41,332
12 fucking years. Missed
my Evelyn growing up.

313
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:43,435
I said I'm sorry.

- Words are easy.
- And it's all I have.

315
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:49,103
- You have something else.
- You are due and you will be paid.

316
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:51,041
- Plus interest.
- Plus interest.

317

bit of blow are a worthy present?

- After what I done for you?
- I was not suggesting...

323
00:22:08,208 --> 00:22:10,791
Cos that don't even come close
to a present, not even close.

bow on her clitoris

- Enough. The joke is over.

344

- I think you should sober up, OK?
- Joke's on you, Ivana.

345
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,525
- Go rest. We'll see you at dinner.
- Ivana Anal-toli.

346
00:23:19,542 --> 00:23:22,166
I have been nothing but polite.

347
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:25,291
Polite? Polite! Aren't
you the bee's knees?

348
00:23:25,292 --> 00:23:26,484
Cunt.

349
00:23:26,958 --> 00:23:28,401
Fucker.

350
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,817
Cunt.

351
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,353
You don't want me to get rough.

352
00:23:41,417 --> 00:23:42,541
Trust me, don't go there.

353
00:23:42,542 --> 00:23:44,394
Don't presuppose to
know what I want.

354
00:23:44,583 --> 00:23:46,749
You don't threaten me,
not with that girl's name.

355
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:48,791
Not with that little
girl's name, Ivana.

356
00:23:48,792 --> 00:23:51,999
Ivana. Ivana? Ivana?
You don't scare me.

357
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,523
You don't fucking
scare me, Anal-toli.

358
00:23:54,583 --> 00:23:56,811
I've seen death. I've seen evil.

359
00:23:56,958 --> 00:23:58,874
I've seen fire. I've seen rain.

360
00:23:58,875 --> 00:24:00,957
I've seen lonely days
I thought would never end.

361
00:24:00,958 --> 00:24:02,582
You don't fucking scare me.

362
00:24:02,583 --> 00:24:05,874
I eye-fuck you. I throat-fuck you!

363
00:24:05,875 --> 00:24:07,582
- Dom!
- Shut it, Dickie!

364
00:24:07,583 --> 00:24:11,438
You one-armed fuck. You freak.
You one-armed fucking fuck freak!

365
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:15,480
No one's talking to you! No
one's ever talking to you!

366
00:24:36,708 --> 00:24:38,355
I'm fucking bored.

367

(BURPS)

368
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,568
I'm fucking drunk.

369
00:24:44,875 --> 00:24:47,694
I'm fucking drunk and
I'm fucking bored.

370
00:24:48,917 --> 00:24:51,611
I said what I wanted to say.
I said it and you heard it.

371
00:24:52,333 --> 00:24:53,855
Now I'm gonna take a nap.

372
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,398
I'll see you wanks at dinner.

373
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:05,228
And no fucking rabbit.

374
00:25:15,458 --> 00:25:17,060

00:25:26,375 --> 00:25:27,897
Dom, you up?

377
00:25:31,042 --> 00:25:32,143
It's 6:30, it's dinner.

378
00:25:35,125 --> 00:25:36,727
Dom, mate!

379
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,022
Dom?

380
00:25:53,625 --> 00:25:55,853
Jesus Christ.

381
00:25:59,875 --> 00:26:02,398
Dom! Dom!

382
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:05,041
- Dom, are you fucking mad?
- I screwed it up, Dickie.

383
00:26:05,042 --> 00:26:06,291
I screwed everything up.

384
00:26:06,292 --> 00:26:09,111
Really? Cos I thought you
were just mentally retarded.

385
00:26:09,167 --> 00:26:11,124
Like those boys with the
bowl cuts on the telethons.

386
00:26:11,125 --> 00:26:13,541
- Dickie, I'm a mess. Look at me.
- I'm trying not to.

387
00:26:13,542 --> 00:26:17,416
I'm pathetic, I don't belong here.
I'm a monster. I'm a dinosaur.

388
00:26:17,417 --> 00:26:20,374
- Don't forget nudist, Dom. Don't forget that!
- I ought to be thrown away.

389
00:26:20,375 --> 00:26:23,374
Sent to a leper colony, forgotten
about, left to rot with the maggots.

390
00:26:23,375 --> 00:26:25,582
Jesus, Dom, you've got to
get control of yourself.

391
00:26:25,583 --> 00:26:27,481
You've got to beg
forgiveness of him.

392
00:26:27,708 --> 00:26:30,982
- You've got to put on trousers.
- I've been locked up for so long, Dickie.

393
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:33,374
I see the light, the air.

394
00:26:33,375 --> 00:26:36,041
It's been so long since
I breathed clean air.

395
00:26:36,042 --> 00:26:37,374
I look at the clouds, I go nuts.

396
00:26:37,375 --> 00:26:40,604
You mix in the whisky, you mix
in the pussy, I go crazy.

397
00:26:40,708 --> 00:26:42,916
I'm a crazy man.
I'm a fucking nutter!

398
00:26:42,917 --> 00:26:45,332
- I mean, I'm afraid to see my own daughter.
- Really?

399
00:26:45,333 --> 00:26:48,357
But not too afraid to insult one of
the most dangerous men in Europe.

400
00:26:48,375 --> 00:26:51,604
Unfortunately, you had
the brass for that one.

401
00:26:57,250 --> 00:27:00,624
He's gonna kill me. I insulted
him in his own villa.

402
00:27:00,625 --> 00:27:03,194
- He'll forgive you.
- He's gonna fucking kill me, Dickie.

403
00:27:03,292 --> 00:27:06,316
He's gonna make Blinis out of
me balls and no one will care.

404
00:27:06,542 --> 00:27:08,457
- Fontaine's not gonna kill you.
- He could.

405
00:27:08,458 --> 00:27:10,541
No one would give a toss,
not even me own daughter.

406
00:27:10,542 --> 00:27:12,610
I would give a toss. She would too.

407
00:27:12,625 --> 00:27:16,275
12 years, Dickie, 12 years for
that money and I just blew it.

408
00:27:17,375 --> 00:27:18,852
You apologise to him.

409
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,569
You be a gentleman and
he'll be a gentleman.

410
00:27:21,958 --> 00:27:23,275
It'll be all right.

411
00:27:23,917 --> 00:27:26,861
Yeah? You promise?

412
00:27:27,083 --> 00:27:30,374
- Yes. But you don't insult his girl.
- (GRUNTS)

413
00:27:30,375 --> 00:27:33,166
You don't call him fucking Ivana,
you don't call him Anal-toli

414
00:27:33,167 --> 00:27:34,940
and you don't let him
see your pecker!

415
00:27:35,417 --> 00:27:37,291
You thank your goddamn lucky stars

416
00:27:37,292 --> 00:27:39,166
that he's a kind and gracious man.
Do you understand?

417
00:27:39,167 --> 00:27:40,291
- Yeah...
- Do you understand?

418
00:27:40,292 --> 00:27:42,770
- Yeah.
- Cos I ain't burying your body out here.

419
00:27:43,208 --> 00:27:46,187
I'm too fucking old and I
didn't bring the right shoes.

420
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:12,772
Sorry I'm late.

421
00:28:14,542 --> 00:28:16,565
And sorry I was such a cunt.

422
00:28:22,208 --> 00:28:25,357

423
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:33,562
You're a vision. You're an angel.

424
00:28:36,458 --> 00:28:38,981
Again, Ivan, Mr Fontaine,

425
00:28:39,417 --> 00:28:40,609
sorry.

426
00:28:40,667 --> 00:28:44,897
Me and, er, drink don't
always dance well together.

427
00:28:44,917 --> 00:28:47,145
I acted up. I acted outrageous.

428
00:28:47,667 --> 00:28:48,791
Sorry.

429
00:28:48,792 --> 00:28:52,476
Sorry I'm late for your dinner
and sorry about before.

430
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,352
When you were a cunt?

431
00:28:55,625 --> 00:28:58,524
(FORCED LAUGHTER)
Yeah, when I was a cunt.

432
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:10,605
Dom, it is water under the bridge.

433
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:12,522
You are forgiven.

434
00:29:14,292 --> 00:29:16,861
- Thank you.
- Now, sit, sit.

435
00:29:18,875 --> 00:29:22,058

rabbit is getting cold.

Get comfortable, please.

Because you so enjoyed
the rabbit, Dom,

00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:55,477
I have a real treat for you.

00:31:03,583 --> 00:31:05,936
my very best friend in the world

456
00:31:06,167 --> 00:31:09,624
was riding his bicycle and
he accidentally crashed

00:31:09,625 --> 00:31:11,898
into this girl I liked.

00:31:13,917 --> 00:31:16,361
Her name was Tatiana.

459
00:31:16,667 --> 00:31:18,519
We went to school together,

460
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,194
though we hadn't ever talked.

461
00:31:21,667 --> 00:31:23,610
But I liked her from afar.

462
00:31:24,292 --> 00:31:29,353
Anyway, my best friend
accidentally crashed into her.

00:31:29,625 --> 00:31:31,693
She got banged up,

464
00:31:31,917 --> 00:31:35,726
got a black eye, crying,
the whole thing.

465
00:31:36,417 --> 00:31:41,068
I went over to my friend, took
the bike from him, lifted it up

466
00:31:41,417 --> 00:31:43,565
and smashed it over his head.

467
00:31:45,375 --> 00:31:51,437
Then I stomped on his hand with my
boot until every bone was broken.

468
00:31:51,583 --> 00:31:53,560
Then I took a rock

469
00:31:54,458 --> 00:31:57,641
and smashed it so
hard into his face,

470
00:31:57,750 --> 00:32:00,319
he not only lost most of his teeth

471
00:32:01,083 --> 00:32:03,481
but most of his jaw as well.

even ever talked to.

do you know why I didn't do
anything to you today, Dom?

01:01:44,208 --> 01:01:47,291
Look at your own hand, Dickie,
if you haven't lost it again.

868
01:01:49,542 --> 01:01:53,067
Seriously, put out your hand,
Dom. Let me see it.

869
01:01:55,708 --> 01:01:56,809
Fucker.

870
01:01:57,917 --> 01:01:59,749
I could do surgery with this hand,

871
01:01:59,750 --> 01:02:02,249

872
01:02:02,250 --> 01:02:04,978

873
01:02:05,208 --> 01:02:07,207
That safe don't scare me.

874
01:02:07,208 --> 01:02:10,642
Lestor McGreevy don't scare me.
Nothing scares me.

875
01:02:11,042 --> 01:02:13,941
Well, you're scaring me,
that much is true.

876
01:02:14,625 --> 01:02:16,193
I'm good.

877
01:02:17,333 --> 01:02:20,482
You're penniless, homeless. You're
fast on your way to being pissed.

878
01:02:21,208 --> 01:02:23,041
Your wank's on the line

879
01:02:23,042 --> 01:02:25,736
and you haven't opened
a safe in 12 years,

880
01:02:25,750 --> 01:02:28,148
and not an electronic
one, not ever.

881
01:02:28,208 --> 01:02:30,749
Aren't you the Easter
Bunny, hopping around,

882
01:02:30,750 --> 01:02:32,898
spreading good cheer
wherever you go?

883
01:02:33,708 --> 01:02:35,651
I'm just stating what I'm stating.

884
01:02:35,792 --> 01:02:39,457
- Stop stating what you're stating.
- I'm not gonna stop stating it.

885
01:02:39,458 --> 01:02:41,435
I'll state what I want to state
in whatever state I want to.

886
01:02:41,458 --> 01:02:43,231
State it again, I'll
knock your teeth out.

887
01:02:43,250 --> 01:02:44,957
Knock my teeth out,
I'll cut your ear off.

888
01:02:44,958 --> 01:02:47,541
Cut my ear off, I'll carve
your eye out with my big toe.

889
01:02:47,542 --> 01:02:48,624
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you.

890
01:02:48,625 --> 01:02:49,726
Fuck you.

891
01:02:50,958 --> 01:02:53,527
You think I ain't gonna
be able to do this?

892
01:02:53,958 --> 01:02:55,957
Me, Dom Hemingway?
Think I can't do this?

893
01:02:55,958 --> 01:02:59,582
There hasn't been a safe I
ain't been able to open, ever.

894
01:02:59,583 --> 01:03:02,857
When I was four months old, I could
open a safe from my fucking pram.

895
01:03:03,208 --> 01:03:05,151
I'm just saying.

896
01:03:05,833 --> 01:03:07,606
Don't say nothing.

897
01:03:11,917 --> 01:03:15,066
I'm gonna do this, Dickie.
I'm gonna do this.

898
01:03:17,542 --> 01:03:19,485
I got no other choice.

- I'm big in Japan.

902
01:03:56,833 --> 01:04:00,041
You have 10 minutes. Do you
want me to start the timing now?

903
01:04:00,042 --> 01:04:03,942
Or do you want to say a little
prayer for your friend Tiny first?

904
01:04:03,958 --> 01:04:06,607
I just want another pint.
Is that OK?

905
01:04:07,125 --> 01:04:09,478
Another drink before we start.

906
01:04:10,250 --> 01:04:12,694
Have all the beer you want, Dom.

907
01:05:08,833 --> 01:05:10,856
Right, let's get started.

908
01:05:11,917 --> 01:05:13,832
LESTOR: Clock says 11:35.

909
01:05:13,833 --> 01:05:16,561
It means you have until 11:45.

910
01:05:16,750 --> 01:05:19,478
Easy-peasy lemon squeezy.

911
01:05:26,667 --> 01:05:28,144
What the fuck is that?

912
01:05:28,208 --> 01:05:29,730
Equipment.

913
01:05:33,333 --> 01:05:34,901
Bloody hell!

914
01:05:35,417 --> 01:05:38,145
Fuck you and fuck your cat.

915
01:05:38,208 --> 01:05:42,438
I said, open my safe,
not destroy my office.

916
01:05:42,458 --> 01:05:45,562
Fuck your office, fuck you,

917
01:05:45,625 --> 01:05:48,444
fuck your father and fuck your cat.

918
01:05:48,458 --> 01:05:52,142
In nine minutes your balls
are becoming trinkets.

01:05:52,167 --> 01:05:56,568
Fuck your trinkets, fuck
your cat, fuck your father,

Not sure what you can do
in the time you have left,

01:06:17,083 --> 01:06:18,526
except maybe have a heart attack.

924
01:06:18,667 --> 01:06:20,485
I got to do a piss.

925
01:06:20,708 --> 01:06:23,527
- What?
- Piss. I got to.

926
01:06:23,542 --> 01:06:25,707
I'm not stopping the clock.

You're pond scum, Lestor.

Garbage, refuse.

929
01:06:30,833 --> 01:06:33,356
Your father was a class
act compared to you.

You're shit on my shoe.
You're a cunt in gold chains.

931
01:06:37,542 --> 01:06:41,727
A misery in size 10 Adidas. Now,
where's your fucking toilet?

932
01:06:47,750 --> 01:06:51,935
- Who designed this place, anyway?
- I did, actually.

933
01:06:52,042 --> 01:06:54,832
It's like a brothel
by way of Elton John.

934
01:06:54,833 --> 01:06:56,901

Five minutes left, Dom.

01:07:10,708 --> 01:07:13,249
Might be the last time
you piss standing up.

939
01:07:13,250 --> 01:07:16,684
I assume the cables in
the back of the safe

940
01:07:17,167 --> 01:07:19,861
are attached to some
security company.

941
01:07:19,917 --> 01:07:22,486
Yes. They promised a
five-minute response.

942
01:07:22,667 --> 01:07:24,666
I promised not to come
in your sister's mouth.

Don't worry, I'm not gonna
do anything to Lestor,

01:07:42,042 --> 01:07:44,236
as tempting as that may be.

947
01:08:04,667 --> 01:08:06,144
Four minutes,

948
01:08:06,250 --> 01:08:08,457
or less if security comes.

10, 12 minutes with a safe like this,

equipment with him.

- No, you're not.

- You're old.
- I'm old-school.

Old, old-school, same thing.

954
01:08:23,333 --> 01:08:26,642
I got magic fingers,
Lestor. I told you.

955
01:08:27,750 --> 01:08:28,851
So?

967
01:09:03,708 --> 01:09:06,249
- Then you got ripped off, Lestor.

Ha, ha, ha!

So what's he trying to do, Dickie?

971
01:09:11,667 --> 01:09:14,207
Most safes, the cheap ones
at least, like yours,

972
01:09:14,208 --> 01:09:16,957
if you bounce them enough, there's
a moment when the pins are shaken

973
01:09:16,958 --> 01:09:19,152
and not lined up, even
the electronic ones.

974
01:09:19,167 --> 01:09:22,066
If you're pulling the handle
at that moment, it opens.

I knew I would. I told you I would.

I knew I'd beat this

I'm the fucker who'll dump your
dead body in a freezing cold lake

1207
01:28:10,292 --> 01:28:13,646
and watch you sink to the
bottom like so much shit.

1208
01:28:14,583 --> 01:28:16,310
I am that fucker.

1209
01:28:17,417 --> 01:28:19,235
That's the fucker who I am.

1210
01:28:20,375 --> 01:28:24,105
And if you say one word
when I remove my hand,

1211
01:28:24,500 --> 01:28:26,499
I'll do all that to you right now.

1212
01:28:26,500 --> 01:28:30,957
You say one word and you'll be as useless
as a dried-up, fetid condom after bad sex.

1213
01:28:30,958 --> 01:28:32,916
Do I make myself clear?

1214
01:28:32,917 --> 01:28:34,707
Do my words translate to you?

1215
01:28:34,708 --> 01:28:37,061
If you understand my words, nod.

1216
01:28:39,292 --> 01:28:40,814
That's good.

1217
01:28:42,292 --> 01:28:46,272
After much heartbreak and ruin,

1218
01:28:47,542 --> 01:28:51,522
the pendulum of luck has finally
swung back to Dom Hemingway.

1219
01:28:53,083 --> 01:28:56,767
And I intend to enjoy each
moment of its fickle pleasure,

1220
01:28:57,042 --> 01:29:00,942
whether it lasts for a minute,
a day or a lifetime.
