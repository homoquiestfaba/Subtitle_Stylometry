1
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,387
Now, the whole country
is in a panic.

2
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:58,190
We've been summoned
to the White House

3
00:00:58,192 --> 00:01:00,626
knowing that the World War
is upon us.

4
00:01:00,628 --> 00:01:04,063
Well, he comes bursting
down the stairs

5
00:01:04,065 --> 00:01:07,433
with his dick resting
over a hanger shouting,

6
00:01:07,435 --> 00:01:11,703
"Does this look too wrinkled
to wear into Congress?"

7
00:01:12,272 --> 00:01:16,208
But that was Woodrow Wilson
for you.

8
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:19,445
He just didn't give a fuck.

9
00:01:20,513 --> 00:01:22,314
The next day

10
00:01:22,316 --> 00:01:25,484
we entered World War I,

11
00:01:25,486 --> 00:01:27,953
and the bitch of it is...

12
00:01:28,888 --> 00:01:31,690
I never got my iron back.

13
00:01:33,893 --> 00:01:35,227
We got movement.

14
00:01:35,229 --> 00:01:38,097
What do you think Bronson,
is this our grizzly?

15
00:01:38,099 --> 00:01:39,131
Can't tell.

16
00:01:39,133 --> 00:01:42,301
It's moving between the trees
too quickly.

17
00:01:42,303 --> 00:01:45,104
Have a look Governor Roosevelt.

18
00:01:48,508 --> 00:01:52,811
Oh, my God!

19
00:01:52,813 --> 00:01:55,180
What is it?

20
00:01:55,882 --> 00:01:57,382
Werewolf!

21
00:01:57,384 --> 00:01:59,451
Everybody run!

22
00:02:05,692 --> 00:02:07,259
[growls]
We're all going to die!

23
00:02:07,261 --> 00:02:10,762
Don't panic, we just got to make
it back to the cabin.

24
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:15,300
Wait! Wait!

25
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:18,070
Why me?
I'm fat and weak.

26
00:02:18,072 --> 00:02:20,072
Probably for exactly
that reason.

27
00:02:20,074 --> 00:02:20,672
No!

28
00:02:20,674 --> 00:02:23,976
Let's get some, boys.
No, we got to
keep moving, Frank.

29
00:02:23,978 --> 00:02:25,577
They carry polio.

30
00:02:25,579 --> 00:02:27,146
[growls]

31
00:02:27,148 --> 00:02:29,581
[groans]

32
00:02:36,623 --> 00:02:40,459
Fuck polio.

33
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:44,963
Good shot, old boy.

34
00:02:44,965 --> 00:02:47,199
Did you put silver bullets
in that thing, Frank?

35
00:02:47,201 --> 00:02:49,501
No, why?

36
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:55,607
That's why. Run!

37
00:02:55,609 --> 00:02:57,509
Oh, shit.

38
00:02:57,511 --> 00:03:00,946
Sweet Jesus!

39
00:03:09,956 --> 00:03:11,657
What the shit?

40
00:03:11,659 --> 00:03:12,491
Ooh!

41
00:03:12,493 --> 00:03:16,261
Why even spend the time
to do that?

42
00:03:16,763 --> 00:03:18,297
Frank, we got to get
the hell out of here.

43
00:03:18,299 --> 00:03:21,066
No chair lift,
we're never going to make it.

44
00:03:21,068 --> 00:03:23,402
We're going to have to go
old school on this.

45
00:03:23,404 --> 00:03:26,638
This isn't a time for that--
we need silver bullets.

46
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:43,422
[yells]

47
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,234
Oh, sick goblins!

48
00:03:55,236 --> 00:03:57,536
Frank, I'm sorry.

49
00:03:57,538 --> 00:04:00,572
Tell Eleanor I love her.

50
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,510
Eleanor has silver bullets.

51
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:15,387
Eleanor.

52
00:04:15,389 --> 00:04:18,390
Frank, stay with me.

53
00:04:18,392 --> 00:04:20,392
Stay with me, Frank.

54
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:29,368
Frank, Frank,
stay with me, Frank.

55
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:31,470
Please.

56
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,806
[gasps]

57
00:04:35,508 --> 00:04:37,075
Oh, thank God.

58
00:04:37,077 --> 00:04:38,644
Oh, I thought
you were dead, Frank.

59
00:04:38,646 --> 00:04:43,081
Ain't nobody going to take down
The Delano, Kitten Tits.

60
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:46,285
Kitten Breasts, Frank.

61
00:04:46,287 --> 00:04:47,653
Hey, Frank, how you feeling?

62
00:04:47,655 --> 00:04:52,157
Like a bag full of dicks
at a lesbian convention.

63
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:53,959
Oh, language, Franklin.

64
00:04:53,961 --> 00:04:59,698
[French accent]
Eh, Comme sucka des dicks
at a convention de lesbian.

65
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,333
Oh, that's better.

66
00:05:01,335 --> 00:05:03,302
[knock on door]

67
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:06,204
Easy Lou, just me.

68
00:05:06,206 --> 00:05:07,806
Put that hamster back
in its cage.

69
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:10,309
Glad to see you awake,
Governor Roosevelt.

70
00:05:10,311 --> 00:05:14,079
Let me just say, on behalf
of the great State of New York,

71
00:05:14,081 --> 00:05:15,647
it is our honor--
Cut the shit, doc.

72
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:18,116
If I wanted smoke
blown up my ass,

73
00:05:18,118 --> 00:05:19,284
I would have spread my cheeks

74
00:05:19,286 --> 00:05:23,155
and jammed a whistling teapot
up there.

75
00:05:24,757 --> 00:05:27,125
Why can't I feel my legs?

76
00:05:27,127 --> 00:05:30,562
When the werewolf attacked you
and bit your leg,

77
00:05:30,564 --> 00:05:33,598
it released a small stream of--

78
00:05:34,867 --> 00:05:37,969
You've got the polio, Frank.

79
00:05:39,305 --> 00:05:40,839
Does my cock still work?

80
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:44,476
Yes, I had one of the nurses
run tests.

81
00:05:47,914 --> 00:05:48,747
Well,

82
00:05:48,749 --> 00:05:52,184
why is everybody looking
so down? Cock works.

83
00:05:52,186 --> 00:05:54,986
I'll be up and at it
in no time.

84
00:05:54,988 --> 00:05:57,856
Oh, in two weeks, Lou,
I want a rematch

85
00:05:57,858 --> 00:06:00,392
of that 100 yard dash,
you son of a bitch.

86
00:06:00,394 --> 00:06:02,327
I'm going to get you this time!

87
00:06:02,329 --> 00:06:04,429
I'm going to get you!

88
00:06:04,431 --> 00:06:07,032
Frank, Frank,
you're not hearing me.

89
00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:09,701
You'll never be able
to walk again.

90
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:10,335
What?

91
00:06:10,337 --> 00:06:11,903
That's the thing
about werewolf attacks--

92
00:06:11,905 --> 00:06:15,807
where you're bitten is where
the polio sets in.

93
00:06:15,809 --> 00:06:18,043
In your case...

94
00:06:19,846 --> 00:06:22,047
it's your legs.

95
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:24,216
[gasps] Oh!

96
00:06:24,218 --> 00:06:27,753
God, no.

97
00:06:27,755 --> 00:06:28,520
Why?

98
00:06:28,522 --> 00:06:33,291
Why did you have to give him
tiny, little, shriveled-up
polio legs?

99
00:06:33,293 --> 00:06:36,595
Why, why!

100
00:06:36,597 --> 00:06:38,196
I love you Eleanor,

101
00:06:38,198 --> 00:06:40,232
but you got to just
shut-the-fuck-up

102
00:06:40,234 --> 00:06:41,466
when grown men
are conversing!

103
00:06:41,468 --> 00:06:44,136
Fortunately, Louis got you
to the hospital

104
00:06:44,138 --> 00:06:46,538
before the polio spread
to your--

105
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:50,675
Good looking out, Lou.

106
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:54,346
On the reels,
I'll never walk again?

107
00:06:54,348 --> 00:06:56,248
Can't something be did?

108
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,583
If I'm going to give you real
barbershop talk,

109
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:00,819
no rashes, no chalk--
with rehabilitation

110
00:07:00,821 --> 00:07:02,921
you might be able to stand
with leg braces--

111
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:04,356
possibly a cane.

112
00:07:04,358 --> 00:07:07,259
But you will never again walk
without guided assistance.

113
00:07:07,261 --> 00:07:09,394
Well, fuck it then! Just get
a goddamn hacksaw up here

114
00:07:09,396 --> 00:07:13,098
and cut my legs off and sew them
on his goddamn body!

115
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,433
Oh, let's do that.

116
00:07:14,435 --> 00:07:15,600
Keep your pants on, Louis.

117
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:17,369
That isn't how this works.

118
00:07:17,371 --> 00:07:19,838
There's nothing more we can do.

119
00:07:20,473 --> 00:07:23,041
Mr. Roosevelt,
I'm so very sorry.

120
00:07:23,043 --> 00:07:26,378
Eleanor can take you home
this afternoon.

121
00:07:32,518 --> 00:07:35,153
All right, thank you, doctor.

122
00:07:35,155 --> 00:07:38,790
Louis, can I see you
out in the hallway for a moment?

123
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,727
[Eleanor whines]
Shut up.

124
00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:46,898
What's the skinny, pill pusher?
It's not good for me to leave
the Gov by himself.

125
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:49,434
There's something I need
to show you.

126
00:07:49,436 --> 00:07:52,137
Do not grab your dick and ask me
to guess the temperature.

127
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:54,206
Motherfucker, I'm not playing
hide the keys

128
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:55,907
from the jailer either,
understand?

129
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:57,242
Put the gun away.

130
00:07:57,244 --> 00:07:58,410
What I'm about to show you

131
00:07:58,412 --> 00:08:00,212
affects not only
Governor Roosevelt,

132
00:08:00,214 --> 00:08:03,081
but possibly all of mankind.

133
00:08:07,386 --> 00:08:09,521
I don't understand--
why are we in the morgue?

134
00:08:09,523 --> 00:08:14,459
This is what I wanted
to show you.

135
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:16,928
What the fuck, bro?

136
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:19,030
Sorry, wrong one.

137
00:08:21,033 --> 00:08:25,303
This is what I wanted
to show you.

138
00:08:26,706 --> 00:08:28,039
That thing's dead, right?

139
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:30,041
Yes, I had a male nurse
check him out.

140
00:08:30,043 --> 00:08:32,210
I won't go into details,
but I owed him a favor.

141
00:08:32,212 --> 00:08:36,815
Anyway, while he was
shaving him, he found this.

142
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:39,251
Is that a belly tattoo
of a swastika?

143
00:08:39,253 --> 00:08:42,087
The detail's amazing--
Those fucking Germans, man,

144
00:08:42,089 --> 00:08:43,288
their craftsmanship
is unmatched.

145
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:45,357
How do you know the werewolf
is German?

146
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:47,692
Besides the swastika,

147
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:50,095
we found this on him.

148
00:08:50,763 --> 00:08:51,429
But why?

149
00:08:51,431 --> 00:08:54,332
We're not at war with Germany
anymore-- this doesn't add up.

150
00:08:54,334 --> 00:08:57,102
I'm not a mathematician,
I'm a damn doctor!

151
00:08:57,104 --> 00:08:59,271
And I didn't train on wolves.

152
00:08:59,273 --> 00:09:00,171
Plus, he's a German.

153
00:09:00,173 --> 00:09:01,873
We have to call in
the authorities.

154
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,441
You shut that whole
spitting shit

155
00:09:03,443 --> 00:09:05,143
out of your face,
do you hear me?

156
00:09:05,145 --> 00:09:06,611
Do you hear me?
Yes.

157
00:09:06,613 --> 00:09:08,013
Good, now--

158
00:09:08,015 --> 00:09:10,115
I'm going to pull my Model A
around the back

159
00:09:10,117 --> 00:09:11,616
while you bag
this son of a bitch up.

160
00:09:11,618 --> 00:09:14,152
Then you are going to help me
load him into the automobile.

161
00:09:14,154 --> 00:09:16,555
And if you breathe a word
of this to the press out there,

162
00:09:16,557 --> 00:09:18,657
so help me God, I will come up
in here with an axe

163
00:09:18,659 --> 00:09:21,459
I will split your ass in two
like a Granny Smith apple.

164
00:09:21,461 --> 00:09:23,562
Do you understand me?
Yes!

165
00:09:23,564 --> 00:09:24,829
Good.

166
00:09:24,831 --> 00:09:26,765
The Governor's had a bad day.

167
00:09:26,767 --> 00:09:29,367
I don't want him seeing any
of this shit.

168
00:09:29,369 --> 00:09:31,803
Bag that evidence with it too.

169
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:34,639
I've had a bad day too.

170
00:09:34,641 --> 00:09:35,640
[intercom beeps]

171
00:09:35,642 --> 00:09:38,643
<i>Doctor Bender</i>
<i>to the mental ward, please.</i>

172
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:42,314
I don't know if I could spend
the rest of my life

173
00:09:42,316 --> 00:09:44,616
in that goddamn thingy.

174
00:09:44,618 --> 00:09:45,483
I know, sweetie.

175
00:09:45,485 --> 00:09:47,919
When we get out of here,
I say we get a second opinion

176
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:50,055
about attaching Louis's legs
to your body.

177
00:09:50,057 --> 00:09:52,424
[crowd chanting]
<i>FDR, FDR, FDR...</i>

178
00:09:52,426 --> 00:09:53,925
What the hell is that?

179
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:54,926
FDR, FDR...

180
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:57,095
Looks like a crowd
is gathered outside.

181
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:59,798
And they're holding signs
for you--

182
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,366
to run for President,

183
00:10:01,368 --> 00:10:04,302
FDR, FDR, FDR...

184
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:07,939
among other things.

185
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:09,374
Hey, Frank, you got a minute?

186
00:10:09,376 --> 00:10:10,909
Yeah, sure-- what the hell's
going on out there.

187
00:10:10,911 --> 00:10:13,712
It's pandemonium, people are
going shit house, Frank.

188
00:10:13,714 --> 00:10:15,180
You're all over the news.

189
00:10:15,182 --> 00:10:16,414
We got to get you
out there, boss.

190
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:18,350
Let the people know
you're all right.

191
00:10:18,352 --> 00:10:19,718
I can't.

192
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,052
At least not in that thing.

193
00:10:21,054 --> 00:10:24,723
Mr. Roosevelt, there's someone
out here that would like
to see you.

194
00:10:24,725 --> 00:10:27,826
Unless it's your identical twin,
not right now.

195
00:10:27,828 --> 00:10:30,395
It's a ten-year-old boy, Timmy.

196
00:10:30,397 --> 00:10:32,731
He's stricken with polio.

197
00:10:32,733 --> 00:10:33,965
Werewolf attack?

198
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:35,900
No, he had a prolonged virus

199
00:10:35,902 --> 00:10:37,035
in his intestinal track.

200
00:10:37,037 --> 00:10:39,037
Well, mine's kind of braver--
sorry.

201
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:42,607
Frank.
Oh, all right, I'll see him.

202
00:10:42,609 --> 00:10:44,542
God.

203
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:49,881
Hi, Mr. Roosevelt.

204
00:10:49,883 --> 00:10:52,684
Please call me Governor.

205
00:10:52,686 --> 00:10:54,719
Okay, Gov, Gov, Governor.

206
00:10:54,721 --> 00:10:58,056
Oh, Jesus, is polio going to
make me stutter too?

207
00:10:58,058 --> 00:11:00,091
Oh, no, that's a separate
problem

208
00:11:00,093 --> 00:11:01,593
he's dealing with, as well.

209
00:11:01,595 --> 00:11:03,128
Oh, thank God.

210
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:06,898
Wha-- why aren't you
in a wheelchair?

211
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:09,067
Well, Tommy,
Timmy.

212
00:11:09,069 --> 00:11:13,104
Timmy, I uh...

213
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:22,080
I was just waiting for you
to come in

214
00:11:22,082 --> 00:11:24,883
and push it to me.

215
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:26,718
Did you hear that, son?

216
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,821
Bring the Governor
his wheelchair.

217
00:11:39,098 --> 00:11:40,932
Independent.

218
00:11:40,934 --> 00:11:43,101
There you go.

219
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:57,449
Well, now we're
twi, twi, twi, twins.

220
00:11:58,584 --> 00:12:00,485
Thanks for taking the time,
Governor.

221
00:12:00,487 --> 00:12:01,920
It sure means a lot to him.

222
00:12:01,922 --> 00:12:03,321
I bet it does.

223
00:12:03,323 --> 00:12:04,222
Well, hmm,

224
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:07,158
take care of yourself,
Tommy-- Timmy.
Timmy.

225
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:10,829
And why don't you drop
by the mansion

226
00:12:10,831 --> 00:12:16,067
on the sixth Tuesday in July
and we'll have a catch?

227
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:19,838
Thank you.
Yes.

228
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:26,478
[stutters]
Are you going to run
for President,

229
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,079
Mr. Roosevelt?

230
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:33,785
You're the only one
who can save us.

231
00:12:37,456 --> 00:12:42,093
FDR, FDR, FDR...

232
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:52,403
Are you sure you want
to do this, Frank?

233
00:12:52,405 --> 00:12:53,671
I'm sure.

234
00:12:53,673 --> 00:12:56,374
I've got it from here.

235
00:12:56,376 --> 00:12:57,509
How you feeling, Governor?

236
00:12:57,511 --> 00:12:59,844
Like a one dollar bill,
never better.

237
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:02,814
What was it like being attacked
by a werewolf?

238
00:13:02,816 --> 00:13:04,149
About the same
as having your money

239
00:13:04,151 --> 00:13:07,051
in the stock market,
these days.

240
00:13:09,321 --> 00:13:10,221
Hey, Governor Roosevelt,

241
00:13:10,223 --> 00:13:13,658
there hasn't been a werewolf
attack on a public figure

242
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:16,361
since Abraham Lincoln in 1860.

243
00:13:16,363 --> 00:13:17,495
Why now?

244
00:13:17,497 --> 00:13:18,429
Ask him.

245
00:13:18,431 --> 00:13:19,964
Oh, no, wait-- head blown off.

246
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:22,066
Almost forgot about that.

247
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:26,638
But who am I kidding?
I'm not any better.

248
00:13:27,606 --> 00:13:30,308
Marco... polio.

249
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:34,612
Hey, all kidding aside,
Mr. Roosevelt,
Yep.

250
00:13:34,614 --> 00:13:36,314
you plan on running
for President?

251
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:37,615
And if you win,
how will it feel

252
00:13:37,617 --> 00:13:40,518
to be the first invalid
ever elected?

253
00:13:41,353 --> 00:13:43,788
Gee, Bob, if I had known you
were going to try to fuck me,

254
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:47,525
I would have had the hospital
dress me in a nicer gown.

255
00:13:48,627 --> 00:13:51,830
Men are not prisoners
of their fate.

256
00:13:51,832 --> 00:13:56,401
They are only prisoners
of their own mind.

257
00:13:56,403 --> 00:14:01,840
And I will not allow you
to rape the prisoner

258
00:14:01,842 --> 00:14:04,776
inside my mind.

259
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:07,712
And as far as invalids go--

260
00:14:07,714 --> 00:14:12,050
oh, hell, the conservatives
in this country

261
00:14:12,052 --> 00:14:14,719
have been invalids for years.

262
00:14:15,387 --> 00:14:16,487
He's got that right.

263
00:14:16,489 --> 00:14:20,692
I view this werewolf attack
not as an attack against me,

264
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:22,527
but an attack
against our nation.

265
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:25,763
And I will fight the problems
of this nation

266
00:14:25,765 --> 00:14:27,732
with the same tenacity
that I used

267
00:14:27,734 --> 00:14:30,335
to take down
that vicious beast.

268
00:14:31,403 --> 00:14:35,139
So, today I toss my hat
into the ring

269
00:14:35,141 --> 00:14:38,243
with the Democratic Party
to be the next President

270
00:14:38,245 --> 00:14:41,145
of the United States.

271
00:14:42,314 --> 00:14:45,083
God bless America.

272
00:14:45,085 --> 00:14:48,219
FDR, FDR, FDR...

273
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:52,724
How was that?
It was good.

274
00:14:52,726 --> 00:14:54,826
The part about the prisoner
was a little weird.

275
00:14:54,828 --> 00:14:57,595
I was freestyling, son.

276
00:14:57,597 --> 00:14:58,796
Oh, Frank!

277
00:14:58,798 --> 00:15:00,798
Mrs. Roosevelt,
you're going to have to sit

278
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,533
up front on Franklin's lap.

279
00:15:02,535 --> 00:15:03,701
Ooh.

280
00:15:03,703 --> 00:15:04,302
Why?

281
00:15:04,304 --> 00:15:06,571
Because there's a dead werewolf
in the trunk.

282
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:08,640
I'll explain later.

283
00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:15,580
Did you debrief him?

284
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:16,581
Yes.
Cool.

285
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:18,716
I hate when I have to take
his boxers off.

286
00:15:18,718 --> 00:15:20,518
Is he in bed?
Yes.

287
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,386
Where are you going?

288
00:15:21,388 --> 00:15:24,789
I'm going to sleep
in the guest bedroom.

289
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:27,458
Do you really think
he should be alone right now?

290
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:29,127
I can't--

291
00:15:29,129 --> 00:15:31,229
It's just--

292
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,064
His legs--

293
00:15:33,066 --> 00:15:36,367
They're shriveled-up
like two-day-old hot dogs.

294
00:15:36,369 --> 00:15:39,404
I don't want them
touching me.

295
00:15:39,406 --> 00:15:40,171
Eleanor,

296
00:15:40,173 --> 00:15:43,074
He is running for the Presidency
of the United States.

297
00:15:43,076 --> 00:15:45,443
You are his wife
and a potential first lady.

298
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:46,844
So, what are you saying?

299
00:15:46,846 --> 00:15:49,781
What I'm saying is you have got
to get your shit together!

300
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:50,848
Not just for Frank,

301
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:53,484
but for the good of the whole
country, do you hear me?

302
00:15:53,486 --> 00:15:54,619
[whispers] Yes.

303
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:55,620
A divorce will blow his chances

304
00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:57,956
right out of the water
and that just can't happen.

305
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:00,024
There's too much at stake.

306
00:16:00,026 --> 00:16:01,025
We think

307
00:16:01,027 --> 00:16:03,194
there might still be more...

308
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,831
werewolves out there.

309
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:08,166
Are you serious?

310
00:16:08,168 --> 00:16:12,236
I thought that was
an isolated attack.

311
00:16:12,238 --> 00:16:13,838
We still don't know.

312
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,540
Oh.
Look,

313
00:16:15,542 --> 00:16:17,342
we'll talk about it tomorrow.

314
00:16:17,344 --> 00:16:18,643
Get some sleep.

315
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:20,578
Oh.
[knocks]

316
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,113
<i>Yes.</i>

317
00:16:22,115 --> 00:16:23,648
How you feeling, Frank?

318
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:24,515
Not too bad, actually.

319
00:16:24,517 --> 00:16:26,584
Just getting used to getting
in and out of that chair.

320
00:16:26,586 --> 00:16:30,154
Crawling into bed here, I was
as nervous as a 10-year-old

321
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:32,724
in a whore house.
I bet.

322
00:16:32,726 --> 00:16:33,491
So,

323
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:37,195
Eleanor is tending
to the kids?

324
00:16:37,197 --> 00:16:40,064
Yeah, she's probably
going to spend the night

325
00:16:40,066 --> 00:16:41,599
with them tonight--
keep an eye on them.

326
00:16:41,601 --> 00:16:43,401
They've had a pretty big scare.

327
00:16:43,403 --> 00:16:45,269
They have?
Shit, look at these!
Oh!

328
00:16:45,271 --> 00:16:47,472
Frank, you've got to stop
doing that.

329
00:16:47,474 --> 00:16:48,773
[chuckles]

330
00:16:48,775 --> 00:16:50,308
Here's the paper, by the way.

331
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:51,776
Thank you.

332
00:16:51,778 --> 00:16:53,077
Let's see.

333
00:16:53,079 --> 00:16:56,514
Oh, American hero
and werewolf killer,

334
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:57,515
Franklin Delano Roosevelt

335
00:16:57,517 --> 00:16:59,751
announces he's running
for President.

336
00:16:59,753 --> 00:17:00,752
Thank you, mm-hmm.

337
00:17:00,754 --> 00:17:06,424
I hope it mentions something
about my cock still working.

338
00:17:06,426 --> 00:17:07,191
No.

339
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:08,359
Well, shit, call them up!

340
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:10,595
I want a press release
first thing in the morning.

341
00:17:10,597 --> 00:17:12,196
Before we do that--
But--

342
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:13,398
let's leak them a picture too.

343
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,266
Before we do that, I have
something to discuss with you.

344
00:17:15,268 --> 00:17:18,136
I don't think there's anything
more important than this.

345
00:17:18,138 --> 00:17:20,304
It's about the dead werewolf.

346
00:17:20,306 --> 00:17:23,274
Stuff it-- hang it
over the mantle.

347
00:17:23,276 --> 00:17:24,842
Put it in the kids' room.

348
00:17:24,844 --> 00:17:26,144
This is serious, Frank.

349
00:17:26,146 --> 00:17:27,712
The doctors ran some tests
and they think

350
00:17:27,714 --> 00:17:30,381
the werewolf might have come
from Germany.

351
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:32,250
What?

352
00:17:32,252 --> 00:17:33,051
Yeah.

353
00:17:33,053 --> 00:17:34,218
They found some markings
on it

354
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,521
and some literature
next to the body.

355
00:17:36,523 --> 00:17:38,623
German...

356
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:40,091
why?

357
00:17:40,093 --> 00:17:40,758
I don't know.

358
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,161
But don't you think it's odd
that the last attack

359
00:17:43,163 --> 00:17:45,963
was on Abraham Lincoln
before he ran for President?

360
00:17:45,965 --> 00:17:47,965
The only thing I find odd

361
00:17:47,967 --> 00:17:49,734
is that there's no--

362
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:50,601
I'm serious, Frank.

363
00:17:50,603 --> 00:17:54,505
I'm serious too, Lou,
I am serious!

364
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,208
All right, what should we do?

365
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:58,876
Should we call up the FBI
and have them--

366
00:17:58,878 --> 00:18:01,012
No, no, no, I don't want Hoover
to be using

367
00:18:01,014 --> 00:18:03,781
any bullshit German propaganda
against you in the election.

368
00:18:03,783 --> 00:18:06,150
We'll just
get you elected first,

369
00:18:06,152 --> 00:18:07,552
then we'll let them have
a look at the wolf.

370
00:18:07,554 --> 00:18:10,621
In the meantime, I'll beef up
security on the campaign trail.

371
00:18:10,623 --> 00:18:11,856
That's a good idea,
thank you, Lou.

372
00:18:11,858 --> 00:18:14,325
Just keep the kids
out of the meat freezer

373
00:18:14,327 --> 00:18:16,727
for a couple of months

374
00:18:16,729 --> 00:18:17,895
Oh, Lou,

375
00:18:17,897 --> 00:18:18,729
Yeah.

376
00:18:18,731 --> 00:18:20,131
Cancel my soccer camp tomorrow.

377
00:18:20,133 --> 00:18:24,035
I don't think
I'm going to be any good.

378
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:28,606
Oh, fuck you.

379
00:18:57,069 --> 00:18:59,103
Pleasure.

380
00:18:59,105 --> 00:19:00,004
Yes.

381
00:19:00,006 --> 00:19:00,905
Here we go, there we go.

382
00:19:00,907 --> 00:19:03,674
Excuse me, would you sign
my newspaper?

383
00:19:03,676 --> 00:19:05,009
And does it work?

384
00:19:05,011 --> 00:19:09,013
Damn straight-- the answer
to both those questions.

385
00:19:10,048 --> 00:19:11,649
Thank you.

386
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:13,384
Thank you.

387
00:19:13,386 --> 00:19:15,586
Lou.

388
00:19:15,588 --> 00:19:17,622
Hey.

389
00:19:23,695 --> 00:19:26,664
So, he reads the sign,
he gets all pissed off,

390
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:30,101
throws down his pickax
and helmet and starts to leave.

391
00:19:30,103 --> 00:19:34,505
Well, she-- she runs
out of the brothel naked

392
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:38,042
and says, "No, we don't serve
minors.

393
00:19:38,044 --> 00:19:41,045
You, sir, look well over 18."

394
00:19:51,957 --> 00:19:53,457
[groans]

395
00:19:53,459 --> 00:19:54,926
And we go.

396
00:19:54,928 --> 00:19:59,363
Oh, I'm exhausted
and I can't even stand up.

397
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:02,767
God bless you guys.

398
00:20:02,769 --> 00:20:04,569
Keep laughing, boys.

399
00:20:04,571 --> 00:20:07,405
You think God blessed Tommy?

400
00:20:07,407 --> 00:20:09,874
Hold on, fellows.

401
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:11,008
Who's Tommy?

402
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:15,746
Tommy-- Tommy used to work
on the docks.

403
00:20:15,748 --> 00:20:17,715
Unions been on strike,

404
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:19,450
down on his luck.

405
00:20:19,452 --> 00:20:21,752
It's tough.

406
00:20:21,754 --> 00:20:24,422
So tough.

407
00:20:25,624 --> 00:20:26,991
What happened to him?

408
00:20:26,993 --> 00:20:31,596
Got so depressed,
he tried to off himself.

409
00:20:32,864 --> 00:20:36,167
And who's taking care of him?

410
00:20:36,169 --> 00:20:37,868
His wife, Gina.

411
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:41,305
Gina works the diner all day.

412
00:20:41,307 --> 00:20:44,442
Working for--

413
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:47,411
Come over here,
come over here!

414
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:50,982
Sit on Uncle Frankie's lap.

415
00:20:52,517 --> 00:20:56,287
Okay, sh-hhh.

416
00:20:56,888 --> 00:20:59,457
Your Uncle Delano's going to fix
this shit.

417
00:20:59,459 --> 00:21:01,158
You guys are the salt
of the earth.

418
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,894
The real people who make
this country run.

419
00:21:03,896 --> 00:21:07,832
And I am not going to leave you

420
00:21:07,834 --> 00:21:09,867
to live on a prayer!

421
00:21:09,869 --> 00:21:12,536
[cheers]

422
00:21:33,358 --> 00:21:35,092
Beautiful melons, mam.

423
00:21:35,094 --> 00:21:37,194
They sure are ripe
for the picking.

424
00:21:37,196 --> 00:21:38,729
I meant your tits.

425
00:21:38,731 --> 00:21:39,997
So did I.

426
00:21:39,999 --> 00:21:41,832
What in the hell is going on
down here?

427
00:21:41,834 --> 00:21:44,769
Okay, Frank, got to get there.
Yeah, yeah.

428
00:21:44,771 --> 00:21:49,607
Excuse me, were you ogling
at my wife's breasts?

429
00:21:49,609 --> 00:21:51,309
Mm-mm.

430
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:52,977
I don't mind if you were.

431
00:21:52,979 --> 00:21:55,146
I just want to view it,
that's all.

432
00:21:55,148 --> 00:21:59,350
Congressman Cleavon Baybridge
Buford-- Repube, Georgia.

433
00:21:59,352 --> 00:22:00,885
Nice to meet you.
Yes, you too.

434
00:22:00,887 --> 00:22:02,553
Did you just say Repube?

435
00:22:02,555 --> 00:22:04,121
Mm-hmm, yes, sir.

436
00:22:04,123 --> 00:22:06,057
You mean Republican?

437
00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:07,358
No, sir.

438
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:11,562
The form I filled out when I ran
for congress said Repube on it.

439
00:22:11,564 --> 00:22:13,464
It was a professional
form, sir.

440
00:22:13,466 --> 00:22:15,533
It was typed on paper--

441
00:22:15,535 --> 00:22:17,635
maybe even double-space.

442
00:22:17,637 --> 00:22:20,838
I think you meant Repub,
short for Republican.

443
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,440
No, sir.

444
00:22:22,442 --> 00:22:24,375
I saved the form, sir.

445
00:22:24,377 --> 00:22:27,211
It is inside a folder
marked official on it.

446
00:22:27,213 --> 00:22:28,279
So, I know that it is real.

447
00:22:28,281 --> 00:22:31,082
Yes, but--
You're probably good then.
Let this one go, Frank.

448
00:22:31,084 --> 00:22:33,250
<i>Nice meeting you folks.</i>
Oh, no stay for dinner.

449
00:22:33,252 --> 00:22:37,088
We've got fried chicken
and fresh biscuits and okra.

450
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:38,823
I'll go down on you all.

451
00:22:38,825 --> 00:22:40,991
It'll be a nice time.

452
00:22:40,993 --> 00:22:41,926
Excuse me?

453
00:22:41,928 --> 00:22:47,098
My cousin-- wife is excellent
at entertaining guests.

454
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:50,101
And even though I am a Repube,

455
00:22:50,103 --> 00:22:52,470
it would be an honor to have
the next President

456
00:22:52,472 --> 00:22:55,406
of the United States
over to our house for dinner,

457
00:22:55,408 --> 00:22:57,608
possibly share our bed,

458
00:22:57,610 --> 00:23:00,711
even if he is a Democrat.

459
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,548
No, we have a long campaign
ahead of us.

460
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:06,350
I don't think it's the--

461
00:23:06,352 --> 00:23:08,219
Sir, I can assure you

462
00:23:08,221 --> 00:23:11,756
that this is
a house where wolves

463
00:23:13,825 --> 00:23:16,927
will not attack us.

464
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:19,330
Plus, I got some moonshine

465
00:23:19,332 --> 00:23:21,699
which does not taste
like asshole grease.

466
00:23:21,701 --> 00:23:24,068
Sold!

467
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:25,136
So I said to her

468
00:23:25,138 --> 00:23:28,105
keep your back straight,
knees bent,

469
00:23:28,107 --> 00:23:29,140
feet shoulder-width apart,

470
00:23:29,142 --> 00:23:32,076
and keep your strokes
to a minimum.

471
00:23:32,078 --> 00:23:34,612
Well, she can't golf
worth a shit

472
00:23:34,614 --> 00:23:37,681
but she can give
a hell of a blow job.

473
00:23:37,683 --> 00:23:38,516
It's true.

474
00:23:38,518 --> 00:23:41,886
I'm looking at a big handicap
right now.

475
00:23:41,888 --> 00:23:45,089
Ahhh, Cleavon,

476
00:23:45,091 --> 00:23:49,593
so why do they call
this town Warm Springs?

477
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:51,395
Oh, Legend has it

478
00:23:51,397 --> 00:23:55,566
that whenever a young Injun girl

479
00:23:55,568 --> 00:23:58,369
becomes a woman,

480
00:23:58,371 --> 00:24:01,038
you know, down there,

481
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:04,775
she will race toward the springs

482
00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:07,344
and jump inside the water

483
00:24:07,346 --> 00:24:12,683
and begin her menstruation
process.

484
00:24:12,685 --> 00:24:15,186
It is said that the blood

485
00:24:15,188 --> 00:24:18,322
collectively joining together

486
00:24:18,324 --> 00:24:22,693
creates a natural warmth

487
00:24:22,695 --> 00:24:24,695
that gives a man a feeling

488
00:24:24,697 --> 00:24:30,501
as if he is back inside
a womb again.

489
00:24:30,503 --> 00:24:32,369
It will invigorate him

490
00:24:32,371 --> 00:24:33,737
and cause him to do things

491
00:24:33,739 --> 00:24:38,576
that he could only do
when he was a fetus.

492
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:43,481
Is that true?

493
00:24:47,252 --> 00:24:48,719
Is what true, sir?

494
00:24:48,721 --> 00:24:51,722
The story you just told.

495
00:24:51,724 --> 00:24:56,427
I am sorry,
I am quite inebriated

496
00:24:56,429 --> 00:24:59,964
and I was unaware that I was
speaking out loud just now.

497
00:24:59,966 --> 00:25:01,832
I am shamed.

498
00:25:02,467 --> 00:25:04,702
Who want dessert?

499
00:25:04,704 --> 00:25:07,338
We got peach cobbler,
rhubarb pie,

500
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:11,041
some southern
strawberry jam cake, and--

501
00:25:11,043 --> 00:25:13,644
Excuse me, this doesn't
seem appropriate.

502
00:25:13,646 --> 00:25:14,812
What is that, sir?

503
00:25:14,814 --> 00:25:17,248
A black slave walking in
with a chalkboard

504
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:19,583
around his neck
with dessert choices on it.

505
00:25:19,585 --> 00:25:23,053
It seems a little... racist.

506
00:25:23,588 --> 00:25:26,824
These kind people
have taken me in,

507
00:25:26,826 --> 00:25:29,260
given me an education,

508
00:25:29,262 --> 00:25:31,595
shared their bed with me,

509
00:25:31,597 --> 00:25:34,064
given me food,

510
00:25:34,066 --> 00:25:36,367
and you have the nerve

511
00:25:36,369 --> 00:25:38,202
to call them racist.

512
00:25:38,204 --> 00:25:39,169
How dare you, sir?

513
00:25:39,171 --> 00:25:43,173
I have merely been falling
behind on my writing,

514
00:25:43,175 --> 00:25:46,443
so I asked if I may use
the chalkboard

515
00:25:46,445 --> 00:25:47,778
to further my spelling,

516
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:49,413
and I have to deal with this?

517
00:25:49,415 --> 00:25:50,347
I'm sorry, I--

518
00:25:50,349 --> 00:25:54,485
I shall leave two incongruent
pieces of Georgia pine

519
00:25:54,487 --> 00:25:55,486
next to your bed

520
00:25:55,488 --> 00:25:59,089
in case you want to transfix
them together with twine

521
00:25:59,091 --> 00:26:00,658
and light them ablaze

522
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:03,861
to make you feel at home, sir!

523
00:26:03,863 --> 00:26:05,396
I didn't mean anything.

524
00:26:05,398 --> 00:26:07,831
May I be excused, sir?

525
00:26:07,833 --> 00:26:08,899
Yes, sure, Curtis.

526
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:13,237
I shall be in the garden
playing basketball,

527
00:26:13,239 --> 00:26:15,239
should anyone need me.

528
00:26:19,477 --> 00:26:21,111
So, Mr. Roosevelt,

529
00:26:21,113 --> 00:26:24,048
may I escort you out
to the springs?

530
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:26,817
I think that you will find them
quite delightful.

531
00:26:26,819 --> 00:26:28,519
I know that I do.
[chuckles]

532
00:26:28,521 --> 00:26:31,188
Well, I think that would be
quite pleasant.

533
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:32,523
Mmm, Mrs. Buford,

534
00:26:32,525 --> 00:26:34,391
will you show our esteemed
guest, Louis,

535
00:26:34,393 --> 00:26:36,260
where our extra bathing
suits are?

536
00:26:36,262 --> 00:26:38,062
Oh, that won't be necessary.

537
00:26:38,064 --> 00:26:40,331
I like to be choked.

538
00:26:40,333 --> 00:26:41,799
Mmm, indeed, sir.

539
00:26:41,801 --> 00:26:45,102
Ah, this is remarkable,
I feel so invigorated.

540
00:26:45,104 --> 00:26:50,107
It's like I have full movement
in my extremities again.

541
00:26:50,109 --> 00:26:51,842
Kick your little old
legs, Frank.

542
00:26:51,844 --> 00:26:53,677
Kick your little old legs.

543
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:56,213
Oh, yeah.

544
00:26:57,582 --> 00:26:58,949
Legend has it

545
00:26:58,951 --> 00:27:03,554
that the Injuns used to come
here to hide from werewolves.

546
00:27:03,556 --> 00:27:09,126
Seems the wolves hate
warm water.

547
00:27:11,029 --> 00:27:11,895
Is that real?

548
00:27:11,897 --> 00:27:15,933
Because earlier you told me
another story about this place.

549
00:27:15,935 --> 00:27:17,267
Mm?

550
00:27:17,269 --> 00:27:21,038
I'm sorry, was I speaking
out loud again?

551
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:21,639
Yes.

552
00:27:21,641 --> 00:27:26,243
God, shit, sometimes I think
that I am silent

553
00:27:26,245 --> 00:27:29,880
when these thoughts
just flow between my lips.

554
00:27:29,882 --> 00:27:32,049
I'm seeing a specialist
about it.

555
00:27:32,051 --> 00:27:36,320
Anywho, my doctor recommended
that I come here

556
00:27:36,322 --> 00:27:40,391
to relieve my polio
after my attack.

557
00:27:40,393 --> 00:27:42,593
What?

558
00:27:42,595 --> 00:27:44,795
Well, you were attacked too?

559
00:27:44,797 --> 00:27:46,830
Mm-hmm, yes, sir--

560
00:27:46,832 --> 00:27:48,098
up in the Appalachian Mountains.

561
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:52,503
I had taken my nephew, Jimmy,
Jimmy Carter,

562
00:27:52,505 --> 00:27:54,071
on a camping trip.

563
00:27:54,073 --> 00:27:57,708
Well, in the middle of the night

564
00:27:57,710 --> 00:27:59,677
I had awoken

565
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:02,046
to relieve myself with my hands.

566
00:28:02,048 --> 00:28:05,349
When, all of a sudden,
out of the corner of my eye

567
00:28:05,351 --> 00:28:08,485
I noticed this werewolf

568
00:28:08,487 --> 00:28:09,553
running through the trees

569
00:28:09,555 --> 00:28:12,856
over to the tent,
trying to kill him.

570
00:28:14,926 --> 00:28:15,759
[growl]

571
00:28:15,761 --> 00:28:17,695
Uncle Cleavon, Uncle Cleavon.

572
00:28:17,697 --> 00:28:19,129
[FDR]
And what did he do?

573
00:28:19,131 --> 00:28:20,864
Well, instincts kick in
at that point.

574
00:28:20,866 --> 00:28:24,835
And I do the only thing
that Cleavon Baybridge Buford
knows how to do,

575
00:28:24,837 --> 00:28:26,937
which is to sprint
over to the tent,

576
00:28:26,939 --> 00:28:30,040
pull out a small sterling
silver cheese knife

577
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:32,443
I keep tucked inside my pants
at all times,

578
00:28:32,445 --> 00:28:35,746
and kill that son of a bitch
dead on the spot.

579
00:28:35,748 --> 00:28:39,450
That, sir, was unnecessary.

580
00:28:40,952 --> 00:28:44,688
And you are dead, sir.

581
00:28:49,127 --> 00:28:49,927
Damn.

582
00:28:49,929 --> 00:28:54,264
Well, I got a mild case
of the polio--

583
00:28:54,266 --> 00:28:56,066
enough that I can walk
with a cane

584
00:28:56,068 --> 00:29:00,337
as long as I have plenty
of Georgia peaches.
Ah.

585
00:29:01,639 --> 00:29:03,340
Peaches?

586
00:29:03,342 --> 00:29:05,175
Mm-hmm.

587
00:29:06,377 --> 00:29:10,280
Peaches, meet the next President
of the United States,

588
00:29:10,282 --> 00:29:12,483
Mr. Franklin Delano Roosevelt.

589
00:29:12,485 --> 00:29:15,719
Much obliged, sir.
Mam.

590
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:18,489
I didn't touch your wife.

591
00:29:18,491 --> 00:29:19,456
Oh, that's okay.

592
00:29:19,458 --> 00:29:23,861
Our votes are swing,
if you know what I mean.

593
00:29:29,033 --> 00:29:30,834
Let's enjoy the springs,
shall we?

594
00:29:30,836 --> 00:29:35,339
Here, here.
Enjoy the springs.

595
00:29:37,075 --> 00:29:39,042
This, sir,
was a pleasure.

596
00:29:39,044 --> 00:29:40,911
Well, the pleasure
was all mine.

597
00:29:40,913 --> 00:29:42,579
And mine-- twice.

598
00:29:42,581 --> 00:29:43,647
Thanks, Mrs. Buford.

599
00:29:43,649 --> 00:29:44,815
You're mighty welcome, boys.

600
00:29:44,817 --> 00:29:46,250
You all come back soon,
now, you hear.

601
00:29:46,252 --> 00:29:48,519
And good luck on the rest
of the campaign.

602
00:29:48,521 --> 00:29:52,956
Just know that this Repube
will be voting for you.

603
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:54,558
Cleavon, if I win,

604
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,326
how would you like
to come down to Washington

605
00:29:56,328 --> 00:29:58,662
and serve
as my vice president...

606
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,334
of the hot tub committee.

607
00:30:04,336 --> 00:30:05,869
Are you serious, sir?

608
00:30:05,871 --> 00:30:08,071
Yes, we can always use
a good Repube

609
00:30:08,073 --> 00:30:10,240
like you on the other side
of the aisle.

610
00:30:10,242 --> 00:30:13,143
Sir, you have no idea

611
00:30:13,145 --> 00:30:15,913
how much this would mean to me.

612
00:30:15,915 --> 00:30:17,981
When I was a little boy,

613
00:30:17,983 --> 00:30:20,684
I put a magic hat on a snowman.

614
00:30:20,686 --> 00:30:22,853
And he came to life.

615
00:30:22,855 --> 00:30:26,456
I blacked out, I got all dizzy

616
00:30:26,458 --> 00:30:28,759
and fell over on the ground.

617
00:30:28,761 --> 00:30:30,961
And when I came to,

618
00:30:30,963 --> 00:30:32,296
I looked up

619
00:30:32,298 --> 00:30:35,265
and the sky was filled
with different colors.

620
00:30:35,267 --> 00:30:39,503
We were flying
through the air together,

621
00:30:40,238 --> 00:30:42,272
kicking our little legs.

622
00:30:42,274 --> 00:30:44,608
We were free.

623
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:46,310
We were free.

624
00:30:46,312 --> 00:30:50,514
I have that same feeling
right now, sir.

625
00:30:53,585 --> 00:30:54,852
Just say, "yes."

626
00:30:54,854 --> 00:30:57,087
Yes-- yes, sir.

627
00:30:57,089 --> 00:30:58,021
Yes, sir.

628
00:30:58,023 --> 00:31:00,257
And sir, don't worry--

629
00:31:00,259 --> 00:31:02,860
we will get you
the great State of Georgia.

630
00:31:02,862 --> 00:31:04,061
I can promise you that, sir.

631
00:31:04,063 --> 00:31:06,930
Even though this is a State
filled with Repubes,

632
00:31:06,932 --> 00:31:10,534
I will take my wife
to every single town.

633
00:31:10,536 --> 00:31:14,738
She and I will suck
as many dicks as it takes

634
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:16,640
to get these votes, sir.

635
00:31:16,642 --> 00:31:18,742
That's how much you mean to me.

636
00:31:18,744 --> 00:31:22,379
The experiences we had together,

637
00:31:22,381 --> 00:31:26,250
I will never forget.

638
00:31:27,485 --> 00:31:29,186
Just being friends, you know?

639
00:31:29,188 --> 00:31:30,120
Not in a gay way,

640
00:31:30,122 --> 00:31:33,457
just another politician,
you know?

641
00:31:33,459 --> 00:31:36,894
Just shared
a warm bath together.

642
00:31:36,896 --> 00:31:39,096
I will go door-to-door

643
00:31:39,098 --> 00:31:40,797
and ask each and every person

644
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:44,101
to have a heart
and vote for FDR.

645
00:31:44,103 --> 00:31:46,470
I will do that, sir.

646
00:31:46,472 --> 00:31:49,139
I will do that.

647
00:31:51,175 --> 00:31:52,109
Love the guy--

648
00:31:52,111 --> 00:31:54,111
crazier than shit,
but I love him.

649
00:31:54,113 --> 00:31:56,013

716
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,166
<i>I'll come down there</i>

717
00:36:43,168 --> 00:36:46,102
Sorry, Fuhrer,
wrong Italian.

718
00:36:46,104 --> 00:36:47,504
That is a take-out place
in New York

719
00:36:47,506 --> 00:36:51,074
that is quite delightful--
thin slices, crispy crust

720
00:36:51,076 --> 00:36:53,210
but not overdone, it's--

721
00:36:54,845 --> 00:36:57,080
[ringing]

722
00:36:57,615 --> 00:36:59,115

723
00:36:59,117 --> 00:37:02,018
Mussolini, it's the fuhrer.

724
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:03,119
Yah, heil me.

725
00:37:03,121 --> 00:37:04,087
Did you hear
the news?

726
00:37:04,089 --> 00:37:06,089
[Italian accent]
I heard all about that shit.

727
00:37:06,091 --> 00:37:09,626
We should have taken him out
when we had the chance.

728
00:37:09,628 --> 00:37:12,028
I sent my best man
to take him out

729
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:13,730
before he decided
to run.

730
00:37:13,732 --> 00:37:17,334
But the polio only spread
to his legs.

731
00:37:17,336 --> 00:37:18,768
What about the cock?

732
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:19,836
It still work?

733
00:37:19,838 --> 00:37:22,639
Jah.
Ah, shit!

734
00:37:22,641 --> 00:37:26,042
The last thing we need
is a big swinging dick

735
00:37:26,044 --> 00:37:27,277
in the White House

736
00:37:27,279 --> 00:37:29,512
trying to fuck up
a whole world takeover.

737
00:37:29,514 --> 00:37:32,949
You are preaching
to the gas chamber on this one.

738
00:37:32,951 --> 00:37:34,718
We already lost Franz.

739
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,152
Okay, hold the phone,

740
00:37:36,154 --> 00:37:38,288
I'm going to get Hirohito
on a 3-way.

741
00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:41,057
Get me Hirohito
on a 3-way.

What's the matter you?

747
00:37:51,069 --> 00:37:52,769
Hey.
I'm so sorry, boss.

748
00:37:52,771 --> 00:37:56,740
That's a dry cleaning place
I send out to in New York

749
00:37:56,742 --> 00:37:57,707
for my uniform.

750
00:37:57,709 --> 00:37:59,609
Perfect amount of starch--

751
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:02,579
not too much, not too little--

752
00:38:02,581 --> 00:38:06,349
Hitler, is it too much to ask
to have a decent assistant

753
00:38:06,351 --> 00:38:07,851
hate America like me?

754
00:38:07,853 --> 00:38:10,720
[laughs]
Tell me about it.

755

[ringing]

756
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:14,524
[Japanese accent]
Hello.

757
00:38:14,526 --> 00:38:18,895
Hirohito, it's Moosie
and Hitler.

758
00:38:18,897 --> 00:38:24,367
Ooh, you using that new 3-way
switchboard technology

759
00:38:24,369 --> 00:38:26,036
my scientists invented.

760
00:38:26,038 --> 00:38:30,407
I told you the Japanese
were good at electronics.

761
00:38:30,409 --> 00:38:32,108
Yeah, you also make
a nice car

762
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:35,312
but better
you no drive, huh?

763
00:38:36,514 --> 00:38:38,315
That's funny.

764
00:38:38,317 --> 00:38:40,317
You heard about FDR?

765
00:38:40,319 --> 00:38:41,885
He got elected.

766
00:38:41,887 --> 00:38:42,952
Of course, I did.

767
00:38:42,954 --> 00:38:44,421
And I'm not happy
about it!

768
00:38:44,423 --> 00:38:48,558
Hitler, you were supposed
to take care of him.

769
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,826
If this is going to be
one of those

770
00:38:49,828 --> 00:38:53,063
gang-up-on-Hitler calls,
I'm out.

771
00:38:53,065 --> 00:38:54,864
I say we go to war.

772
00:38:54,866 --> 00:38:55,799
Okay, not yet.

773
00:38:55,801 --> 00:39:00,003
I'm going to send my mafia
guys over to America.

774
00:39:00,005 --> 00:39:02,005
And they're going to handle
this problem

775
00:39:02,007 --> 00:39:02,872
and make it disappear.

776
00:39:02,874 --> 00:39:05,742
I'm going to pollute
the whole country.

777
00:39:05,744 --> 00:39:09,179
And how do you plan
on doing that?

778
00:39:09,181 --> 00:39:10,013
Prohibition.

779
00:39:10,015 --> 00:39:12,615
You see, these guys
still bootleg

780
00:39:12,617 --> 00:39:13,817
my fine Italian wine.

781
00:39:13,819 --> 00:39:18,188
So, I'm going to take
my werewolf blood

782
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:20,657
and I'm going to stick it
in my wine

783
00:39:20,659 --> 00:39:22,325
everybody drink in America.

784
00:39:22,327 --> 00:39:25,762
Then everybody going to be
like us--

785
00:39:25,764 --> 00:39:26,830
a werewolf.

786
00:39:26,832 --> 00:39:30,033
FDR, he going to have
no chance.

787
00:39:30,035 --> 00:39:31,434
I'll make
that whole country

788
00:39:31,436 --> 00:39:35,372
howling at the moon.
[howls]
Yes, jawohl, I like it.

789
00:39:35,374 --> 00:39:38,842
I'll give some of mein fine
German beer

790
00:39:38,844 --> 00:39:40,744
to take, as well, huh?

791
00:39:40,746 --> 00:39:42,779
Me like it too.

792
00:39:42,781 --> 00:39:44,047
Count me in.

793
00:39:44,049 --> 00:39:47,550
We will donate sake.

794
00:39:47,552 --> 00:39:48,318
Sake?

795
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:52,322
Sake is for women
und the gay community.

796
00:39:53,624 --> 00:39:56,159
Laugh it up, bitches!

797
00:39:56,161 --> 00:39:58,762
Sake is a sensual drink

798
00:39:58,764 --> 00:40:03,099
that relaxes the mind,
body, and--

799
00:40:05,269 --> 00:40:07,604
That's so funny.
Fine!

800
00:40:07,606 --> 00:40:09,672
Fuck you!

801
00:40:09,674 --> 00:40:11,174
3-way done!

802
00:40:11,176 --> 00:40:13,276
Pull it!

803
00:40:24,655 --> 00:40:27,123
Mr. President, may I present
to you, George Freeman,

804
00:40:27,125 --> 00:40:30,326
the official
White House butler.
It's an honor, sir.

805
00:40:30,328 --> 00:40:31,394
Freeman, Mother.

806
00:40:31,396 --> 00:40:33,730
Yes, sir.
Kind of ironic, isn't it?

807
00:40:33,732 --> 00:40:35,932
I guess so.

808
00:40:36,333 --> 00:40:40,136
Well, we're going to set
this motherfucker off, George.

809
00:40:40,138 --> 00:40:41,971
Pound my shit!

810
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:44,007
There's some weed
in Washington's humidor--

811
00:40:44,009 --> 00:40:45,742
third drawer down on the right,
good stuff--

812
00:40:45,744 --> 00:40:47,410
no sticks, no stems, no seeds.

813
00:40:47,412 --> 00:40:49,012
My negro.

814
00:40:49,014 --> 00:40:50,447
Literally.

815
00:40:50,449 --> 00:40:51,815
Mr. President,
may I present to you

816
00:40:51,817 --> 00:40:54,083
White House secretary,
Miss Melissa Ricksman.

817
00:40:54,085 --> 00:40:55,752
Mr. President,
anything you need,

818
00:40:55,754 --> 00:40:57,353
anything at all,
don't hesitate to ask.

819
00:40:57,355 --> 00:41:01,724
Anything you dictate,
I will transcribe.

820
00:41:01,726 --> 00:41:03,927
My dictate works just fine.

821
00:41:03,929 --> 00:41:05,662
I mean my dick,

822
00:41:05,664 --> 00:41:07,163
if I was going to dictate
something,

823
00:41:07,165 --> 00:41:10,767
I would talk directly
to the American citizens.

824
00:41:10,769 --> 00:41:13,369
I'm sorry, sir,
I'm not understanding.

825
00:41:13,371 --> 00:41:16,306
You are going to talk
to them directly,

826
00:41:16,308 --> 00:41:18,875
as in town gatherings?

827
00:41:18,877 --> 00:41:21,077
No, what I mean is--
George, how are you with radios?

828
00:41:21,079 --> 00:41:22,579
I'm black, son.
Cool!

829
00:41:22,581 --> 00:41:23,913
Then rig that bitch up--

830
00:41:23,915 --> 00:41:26,382
so I can speak
directly through it

831
00:41:26,384 --> 00:41:27,951
to the entire nation.

832
00:41:27,953 --> 00:41:30,086
Cool.

833
00:41:31,856 --> 00:41:33,556
Hat.

834
00:41:37,094 --> 00:41:39,295
Oh.

835
00:41:39,297 --> 00:41:40,997
There you go, sir.

836
00:41:40,999 --> 00:41:41,831
Right there.

837
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:43,800
Check one-two, check one-two.

838
00:41:43,802 --> 00:41:45,668
Yo, turn me up
in the headphones.

839
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:46,936
Your levels are proper, kid.

840
00:41:46,938 --> 00:41:50,206
Now, let me turn
this record player off.

841
00:41:50,641 --> 00:41:52,308
Ooh, shit, sorry guys.

842
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:55,578
No, no, no, George,
keep doing that-- I like that.

843
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:59,716
The Delano needs to chat
fireside up in this bitch.

844
00:41:59,718 --> 00:42:01,384
Let that beat right out.

845
00:42:01,386 --> 00:42:03,853
Franklin, I think
this is inappropriate.

846
00:42:03,855 --> 00:42:07,524
Shh, grown men conversing--
seen, not heard, Eleanor.

847
00:42:07,526 --> 00:42:10,360
George, keep scratching.

848
00:42:12,663 --> 00:42:15,298
My fellow Americans,

849
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:19,569
<i>this is your new President,</i>
<i>Franklin</i>

850
00:42:19,571 --> 00:42:21,070

Big Baby Juice Maker.

854
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:32,482
And I'm chatting to you
live from the double O.

855
00:42:32,484 --> 00:42:33,383
First of all,

856
00:42:33,385 --> 00:42:37,620
I want to thank you for electing
me as your President.

857
00:42:37,622 --> 00:42:41,858
On the reels,
that was a smart play.

858
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:42,992
Hoover was great.

859
00:42:42,994 --> 00:42:46,229
They'll probably name a dam
or a vacuum cleaner

860
00:42:46,231 --> 00:42:48,898
after him some day, but--

861
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:51,401
he wasn't cut out

862
00:42:51,403 --> 00:42:54,671
for what lies ahead.

863
00:42:54,673 --> 00:42:57,473
I know times are hard.

864
00:42:58,008 --> 00:43:00,944
Some of you
are probably wondering

865
00:43:00,946 --> 00:43:01,945
where your next

866
00:43:01,947 --> 00:43:04,447
<i>meal is coming from, or</i>

867
00:43:04,449 --> 00:43:07,884
who your next employer
is going to be.

868
00:43:07,886 --> 00:43:08,618
Hey, hold my hole.

869
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:10,687
Back of the line--
wait for the glory hole.

870
00:43:10,689 --> 00:43:12,589
You-- glory hole four.

871
00:43:12,591 --> 00:43:13,256
Shh, wait, wait.

872
00:43:13,258 --> 00:43:15,892
I got to hear what
he's got to say.

873
00:43:15,894 --> 00:43:16,693
Me too.

874
00:43:16,695 --> 00:43:18,061
<i>or even if you're</i>

875
00:43:18,063 --> 00:43:21,197

877
00:43:23,234 --> 00:43:24,167
James,

878
00:43:24,169 --> 00:43:26,469
stop crapping in that vase!

879
00:43:26,471 --> 00:43:27,704
Sorry, Manny.

880
00:43:27,706 --> 00:43:29,339
If your daddy wasn't President,

881
00:43:29,341 --> 00:43:32,308
I'd steam your chest
like I was Grover Cleveland.

882
00:43:32,310 --> 00:43:34,677
<i>I want you to rest assured</i>

883

I've got a new deal for you.

885
00:43:40,518 --> 00:43:42,485
I vow

886
00:43:42,487 --> 00:43:44,654
to end the recession

887
00:43:44,656 --> 00:43:46,589
<i>and get every American</i>

888

00:43:48,326 --> 00:43:49,826
How the hell's
he going to do that?

890
00:43:49,828 --> 00:43:53,096
<i>How the hell am I going</i>

00:43:53,098 --> 00:43:54,263
<i>I'm going to</i>

892
00:43:54,265 --> 00:43:55,398
close our borders

893
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:57,867
and block foreigners
from coming in

894
00:43:57,869 --> 00:44:00,303
and taking away jobs
from Americans.

895
00:44:00,305 --> 00:44:01,838
<i>I'm going to give incentives</i>

896
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:05,308
<i>to farmers who provide us</i>
<i>with healthy food.</i>

897
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:07,143
And last, but not least,

898
00:44:07,145 --> 00:44:11,481
I'm going to end prohibition.

899
00:44:11,483 --> 00:44:14,617
I want to be able to come home

900
00:44:14,619 --> 00:44:16,052
after a hard day's work

901
00:44:16,054 --> 00:44:18,721
and drink a glass
of whiskey and milk

902
00:44:18,723 --> 00:44:20,323
like a goddamn man!

903
00:44:20,325 --> 00:44:21,958
You hear that, darling?

904
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:25,695
We don't have to make
toilet wine anymore.

905
00:44:25,697 --> 00:44:27,864
<i>Put the kiddies to sleep.</i>

906
00:44:27,866 --> 00:44:31,668
<i>Parents,</i>
<i>push your beds together.</i>

907
00:44:31,670 --> 00:44:33,770
And know when you wake up,

908
00:44:33,772 --> 00:44:38,374
you will wake up
to a new America.

909
00:44:38,376 --> 00:44:41,077
This is The Delano,

910
00:44:41,079 --> 00:44:42,845
signing off.

911
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:45,148
God bless.

912
00:44:45,150 --> 00:44:48,818
You're off the air,
Mr. President.

913
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:51,954
Jesus, Frank, what was that?

914
00:44:51,956 --> 00:44:54,090
I was freestyling again, son.

915
00:44:54,092 --> 00:44:55,358
Gangsta, wasn't it?

916
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:58,461
Parents pushing
their beds together--

917
00:44:58,463 --> 00:45:00,196
that is disgusting.

918
00:45:00,198 --> 00:45:01,164
Oh, come on, Eleanor.

919
00:45:01,166 --> 00:45:02,699
I think by now
the American people

920
00:45:02,701 --> 00:45:05,735
know that babies do not
come from storks.

921
00:45:05,737 --> 00:45:07,236
Hell, we have six kids.

922
00:45:07,238 --> 00:45:10,273
Let's make a seventh
one, tonight.

923
00:45:10,275 --> 00:45:11,708
Ooh! Ooh!

924
00:45:11,710 --> 00:45:13,242
You're sick.

925
00:45:13,244 --> 00:45:15,912
I'm going to tend the children.

926
00:45:16,814 --> 00:45:19,649
I loved your speech,
Mr. President.

927
00:45:19,651 --> 00:45:21,818
Thank you.
I don't know, Frank,

928
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:24,053
shutting down the borders,
ending prohibition.

929
00:45:24,055 --> 00:45:25,088
Sir, speaking of prohibition,

930
00:45:25,090 --> 00:45:27,390
I think there's something
you need to see--

931
00:45:27,392 --> 00:45:29,926
the FBI would like to have
a word with you.

932
00:45:29,928 --> 00:45:32,929
Ooh, all right, Captain Ominous.

933
00:45:35,632 --> 00:45:38,768
The fucking guy.

934
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:43,940
[clank]

935
00:45:43,942 --> 00:45:46,309
Oh, way to go, Einstein.

936
00:45:46,311 --> 00:45:48,444
Our scientist, Albert Einstein--
a real jackass.

937
00:45:48,446 --> 00:45:52,415
Mr. President, may I present
Douglas MacArthur,

938
00:45:52,417 --> 00:45:54,984
Chief of Staff
of the United States Army.

939
00:45:56,086 --> 00:45:57,286
Mr. President,

940
00:45:57,288 --> 00:45:58,454
Call me Frank.

941
00:45:58,456 --> 00:46:00,890
Dougie Mac.
Peace be with you.

942
00:46:00,892 --> 00:46:01,791
And also with you.

943
00:46:01,793 --> 00:46:03,559
My father was a midget
so, I'll keep it short.

944
00:46:03,561 --> 00:46:05,828
I heard your speech about ending
prohibition, earlier.

945
00:46:05,830 --> 00:46:07,930
Dope, wasn't it?
I was freestyling.

946
00:46:07,932 --> 00:46:09,432
And I can go along with that

947
00:46:09,434 --> 00:46:10,533
when we fuck all those bastards

948
00:46:10,535 --> 00:46:12,702
who wanted prohibition
in the first place.

949
00:46:12,704 --> 00:46:14,203
But unfortunately sir,

950
00:46:14,205 --> 00:46:16,539
you can't end it right now.

951
00:46:16,541 --> 00:46:18,074
Why not?

952
00:46:18,076 --> 00:46:19,675
What we have here

953
00:46:19,677 --> 00:46:20,943
is a pale lager.

954
00:46:20,945 --> 00:46:23,045
And apparently it's been shipped
from overseas.

955
00:46:23,047 --> 00:46:26,048
Now, some college students
have bootlegged it

956
00:46:26,050 --> 00:46:29,051
and drank it,
and have been wolfing out.

957
00:46:29,053 --> 00:46:31,087
Well, what did you do to them?

958
00:46:31,089 --> 00:46:32,488
We killed them!

959
00:46:32,490 --> 00:46:33,256
Is that legal?

960
00:46:33,258 --> 00:46:36,058
We're the United States
Government-- anything's legal

961
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:36,793
Fuck yeah.

962
00:46:36,795 --> 00:46:39,228
Now we ran some tests on this
and sure enough we did find

963
00:46:39,230 --> 00:46:41,664
some small traces
of werewolf blood in it.

964
00:46:41,666 --> 00:46:44,267
And the beer itself
came back German.

965
00:46:44,269 --> 00:46:45,535
Same as the wolf.

966
00:46:45,537 --> 00:46:47,436
Motherfucker!
And that's not all.

967
00:46:47,438 --> 00:46:51,340
We got a report that some kids
went full on beast mode

968
00:46:51,342 --> 00:46:53,075
after drinking some wine.

969
00:46:53,077 --> 00:46:54,243
So, we tested that, as well.

970
00:46:54,245 --> 00:46:55,778
And it came back Italian.

971
00:46:55,780 --> 00:46:57,146
Polluted with wolf blood.

972
00:46:57,148 --> 00:46:59,215
Doesn't make any sense, Dougie.

973
00:46:59,217 --> 00:47:00,183
Tell me about it.

974
00:47:00,185 --> 00:47:03,553
Oh, and there was
a lone case of sake

975
00:47:03,555 --> 00:47:06,255
that was found
in the freighter.

976
00:47:06,257 --> 00:47:08,758
Untouched, obviously.

977
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:09,559
Obviously.

978
00:47:09,561 --> 00:47:11,694
Anybody drank that,
they'd come down

979
00:47:11,696 --> 00:47:15,031
with a fast case
of dick-in-the-mouth.

980
00:47:15,033 --> 00:47:16,866
Chief symptom--
foaming at the ass.

981
00:47:16,868 --> 00:47:21,804
They'd start smelling
in the testicular area.

982
00:47:22,139 --> 00:47:24,874
Shut the fuck up, Einstein!

983
00:47:26,577 --> 00:47:27,543
Damn!

984
00:47:27,545 --> 00:47:31,414
Now, I know this may
sound crazy, Mr. President,

985
00:47:31,416 --> 00:47:35,785
but we think that Germany
and Italy and Japan

986
00:47:35,787 --> 00:47:37,620
are joining forces

987
00:47:37,622 --> 00:47:40,089
to form a kind of axis of power

988
00:47:40,091 --> 00:47:41,624
to take over the world

989
00:47:41,626 --> 00:47:43,226
and turn everyone
into werewolves.

990
00:47:43,228 --> 00:47:45,928
Thundercunt!
Yes, it's a real fuckery!

991
00:47:45,930 --> 00:47:47,563
That same freighter is back

992
00:47:47,565 --> 00:47:50,633
unloading at a warehouse
on a dock in Baltimore.

993
00:47:50,635 --> 00:47:52,501
I have a team of my men
standing by.

994
00:47:52,503 --> 00:47:54,503
No, that won't be necessary.

995
00:47:54,505 --> 00:47:56,739
I got this shit on lock.

996
00:47:56,741 --> 00:47:59,575
I had a feeling
you were going to say that.

997
00:47:59,577 --> 00:48:02,278
Heard you were
a real hard-core S.O.B.

998
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:05,014
You know, don't let
this limp fool you.

999
00:48:05,016 --> 00:48:06,816
I'm as street as they come.

1000
00:48:06,818 --> 00:48:10,119
You cross me and the
motherfuckers come undone.

1001
00:48:10,121 --> 00:48:11,687
No tux, no cummerbund.

1002
00:48:11,689 --> 00:48:15,358
Respect-- Einstein, the chair.

1003
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:17,560
The chair?

1004
00:48:17,562 --> 00:48:21,497
I call this the Delano 2000.

1005
00:48:24,334 --> 00:48:25,101
Oh, shit.

1006
00:48:25,103 --> 00:48:28,104
That's what the fuck
I'm talking about!

1007
00:48:28,106 --> 00:48:29,705
Welcome to death row, gentlemen.

1008
00:48:29,707 --> 00:48:30,439
Ha-ha!

1009
00:48:30,441 --> 00:48:33,542
This chair is fully tricked-out
with two rocket launchers,

1010
00:48:33,544 --> 00:48:37,146
as well as 164 rounds
of silver bullets

1011
00:48:37,148 --> 00:48:38,180
inside the wheel wells,

1012
00:48:38,182 --> 00:48:41,717
that when spun, activate
a machine gun-like intensity.

1013
00:48:41,719 --> 00:48:44,320
Why do you call it
the Delano 2000?

1014
00:48:44,322 --> 00:48:45,187
Because with this

1015
00:48:45,189 --> 00:48:49,058
the Delano is going to blow
those werewolf asses

1016
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:50,326
into the next century!

1017
00:48:50,328 --> 00:48:52,862
Regulators, mount up.

1018
00:48:59,136 --> 00:49:01,103
Hey Paulie, what the fuck?

1019
00:49:01,105 --> 00:49:02,638
Will you watch
what you're doing!

1020
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:06,008
You're going to spill that shit,
you fucking mook.

1021
00:49:06,010 --> 00:49:08,144
Now that would be a shame.

1022
00:49:08,146 --> 00:49:10,379
Wouldn't it?

1023
00:49:12,082 --> 00:49:14,283
FDR.

1024
00:49:14,285 --> 00:49:15,151
Wow.

1025
00:49:15,153 --> 00:49:17,687
Surprised to see
you here.

1026
00:49:17,689 --> 00:49:21,757
Hey, how's that polio
treating you, huh?

1027
00:49:21,759 --> 00:49:25,194
Hey, I heard you were
on your last leg.

1028
00:49:26,063 --> 00:49:29,131
But I thought you were
a stand-up guy.

1029
00:49:29,133 --> 00:49:31,701
I'm sorry, is that your face

1030
00:49:31,703 --> 00:49:35,404
or are you talking
out of a vagina?

1031
00:49:37,207 --> 00:49:41,944
You crippled motherfucker!
Get him!

1032
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:13,576
Okay, okay, okay!

1033
00:50:14,244 --> 00:50:16,712
Please, don't kill me, please.

1034
00:50:16,714 --> 00:50:19,415
Oh, well, since you're being
so nice and saying, "please,"

1035
00:50:19,417 --> 00:50:22,451
the least I can do
is offer you a drink.

1036
00:50:31,795 --> 00:50:32,962
All right!

1037
00:50:32,964 --> 00:50:36,365
What the hell do you want, huh?

1038
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:40,536
I'll do anything.

1039
00:50:43,507 --> 00:50:45,307
I'll suck your dick.

1040
00:50:45,309 --> 00:50:47,243
What?

1041
00:50:48,712 --> 00:50:50,980
I'll suck your dick.

1042
00:50:52,315 --> 00:50:53,382
Please!

1043
00:50:53,384 --> 00:50:54,350
Get the fuck out of here

1044
00:50:54,352 --> 00:50:56,085
and show some respect
for yourself, man!

1045
00:50:56,087 --> 00:50:58,087
Thank you, thank you,
Mr. President.

1046
00:50:58,089 --> 00:51:01,323
And tell your leader,
if I see another werewolf

1047
00:51:01,325 --> 00:51:02,291
on American soil,

1048
00:51:02,293 --> 00:51:04,060
I am personally going
to come over there,

1049
00:51:04,062 --> 00:51:07,763
roll down the streets, and kill
every last motherfucker

1050
00:51:07,765 --> 00:51:09,899
I see with a face comb-over.

1051
00:51:09,901 --> 00:51:10,933
Do you hear me!

1052
00:51:10,935 --> 00:51:15,471
The Delano don't give a fuck!

1053
00:52:08,058 --> 00:52:08,791
Boss,

1054
00:52:08,793 --> 00:52:10,159
Eh, what's the matter
with you?

1055
00:52:10,161 --> 00:52:13,162
I'm making cannoli,
you scared me out of my skin.

1056
00:52:13,164 --> 00:52:15,231
I mean,
I know we're werewolf,

1057
00:52:15,233 --> 00:52:17,900
but have some couth,
for Chris sake, huh?

1058
00:52:17,902 --> 00:52:19,435
I'm sorry, boss.

1059
00:52:19,437 --> 00:52:21,270
How did the drop off go?

1060
00:52:21,272 --> 00:52:23,472
Not too good, boss.

1061
00:52:23,474 --> 00:52:26,308
You see, Roosevelt showed up

1062
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:29,879
and uh... he sort of killed
everyone.

1063
00:52:29,881 --> 00:52:31,413
How the hell he kill everybody?

1064
00:52:31,415 --> 00:52:33,382
The guy got polio,
for fuck sake!

1065
00:52:33,384 --> 00:52:35,684
That's just it--
he rolled up in some kind

1066
00:52:35,686 --> 00:52:37,353
of tricked-out
wheel-fucking chair

1067
00:52:37,355 --> 00:52:41,123
with machine guns
and missile contraptions.

1068
00:52:41,125 --> 00:52:42,124
I don't know.

1069
00:52:42,126 --> 00:52:45,728
But you still alive--
how do you do that, eh?

1070
00:52:46,263 --> 00:52:49,198
You suck the dick?

1071
00:52:49,633 --> 00:52:51,500
Oh, you suck the dick?

1072
00:52:51,502 --> 00:52:53,202
Oh, you suck the dick, Vincent.

1073
00:52:53,204 --> 00:52:55,204
No suck the dick.

1074
00:52:55,206 --> 00:52:57,406
Eh, Vincenzo,
do me a favor.

1075
00:52:57,408 --> 00:52:58,707
You take a little plug
over there,

1076
00:52:58,709 --> 00:53:00,910
you stick it in the wall
in the hole that says Hitler.

1077
00:53:00,912 --> 00:53:04,046
Yeah, I make a call,
go ahead.
Yeah, sure, boss.

1078
00:53:05,048 --> 00:53:06,415
Anything else, boss?

1079
00:53:06,417 --> 00:53:09,051
No, I'm good, Vincenzo.

1080
00:53:12,189 --> 00:53:13,956
[sighs]

1081
00:53:15,158 --> 00:53:18,127
[ringing]

1082
00:53:21,798 --> 00:53:23,365
You got to take a drink.

1083
00:53:23,367 --> 00:53:25,401
<i>Hitler, it's Moose.</i>

1084
00:53:25,403 --> 00:53:27,069
Shit got fucked up.

1085
00:53:27,071 --> 00:53:29,438
FDR, he iced everybody.

1086
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:32,675
<i>Scheisse, I told you that guy</i>
<i>was ein badass.</i>

1087
00:53:32,677 --> 00:53:34,877
What do you
suggest we do?

1088
00:53:34,879 --> 00:53:36,478
You already know
my answer.

1089
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:39,415
It rhymes with go
to fucking war.

1090
00:53:39,417 --> 00:53:40,716
Big shock, there.

1091
00:53:40,718 --> 00:53:42,518
You talk
to Hirohito?

1092
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:44,987
No, I'll get him
on the 3-way.

1093
00:53:44,989 --> 00:53:46,222
Oh, scheisse!

1094
00:53:46,224 --> 00:53:49,925
Are you playing beer pong again
with the big-titty girl?

1095
00:53:49,927 --> 00:53:51,393
Who me? [laughs]

1096
00:53:51,395 --> 00:53:57,533
No, we're just working
on plans to kill Jews.
Ah.

1097
00:53:57,535 --> 00:53:59,602
Get me Hirohito.

1098
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:05,774
[ringing]

1099
00:54:14,618 --> 00:54:16,452
[phone rings]

1100
00:54:18,455 --> 00:54:19,688
Hello.

1101
00:54:19,690 --> 00:54:22,057
Hiro, it's Moosie
and Hitler.

1102
00:54:22,059 --> 00:54:25,594
Excellent, how did
the mission go?

1103
00:54:25,596 --> 00:54:27,062
Is Franklin dead?

1104
00:54:27,064 --> 00:54:29,565
No, he sniffed out
our plan

1105
00:54:29,567 --> 00:54:30,833
and kill all
my mafia guys

1106
00:54:30,835 --> 00:54:33,269
before they had a chance
for the beer and the wine

1107
00:54:33,271 --> 00:54:34,770
to spill
and take effect.

1108
00:54:34,772 --> 00:54:35,871
Did anyone think--

1109
00:54:35,873 --> 00:54:38,307
Sir, this package just
came for you.

1110
00:54:38,309 --> 00:54:40,209
Did I not kill you already?

1111
00:54:40,211 --> 00:54:42,745
No, sir, we do not
all look alike.

1112
00:54:42,747 --> 00:54:45,948
I'm on 3-way long distance!

1113
00:54:45,950 --> 00:54:49,351
I'm sorry, sir,
but this is from America.

1114
00:54:49,353 --> 00:54:52,855
There's a card that's
from the White House

1115
00:54:52,857 --> 00:54:55,090
Hold on, guys.

1116
00:55:02,899 --> 00:55:05,100
Son of bitch!

1117
00:55:09,539 --> 00:55:11,807
I say we go to war.

1118
00:55:11,809 --> 00:55:14,043
If we spread
the werewolf virus

1119
00:55:14,045 --> 00:55:16,378
across to neighboring
countries,

1120
00:55:16,380 --> 00:55:20,382
we can take over
the world slowly

1121
00:55:20,384 --> 00:55:21,917
and we crush him!

1122
00:55:21,919 --> 00:55:24,520
Yes, finally someone
who gets it.

1123
00:55:24,522 --> 00:55:26,088
Hito, you are awesome.

1124
00:55:26,090 --> 00:55:29,291
I'll start with Austria,
Czechoslovakia,

1125
00:55:29,293 --> 00:55:31,927
und then we march
into Poland for lunch.

1126
00:55:31,929 --> 00:55:33,295
I will take over China.

1127
00:55:33,297 --> 00:55:35,564
Cool, I'll take
Ethiopia.

1128
00:55:35,566 --> 00:55:36,565
What!

1129
00:55:36,567 --> 00:55:38,534
You fucking pussy.

1130
00:55:38,536 --> 00:55:39,601
Ethiopia, really?

1131
00:55:39,603 --> 00:55:41,904
What, Ethiopia
is strong.

1132
00:55:41,906 --> 00:55:44,440
Great runners--
guys run very fast.

1133
00:55:44,442 --> 00:55:46,508
Plus, Hitler,
you going to need

1134
00:55:46,510 --> 00:55:48,444
somebody coming up
from the south

1135
00:55:48,446 --> 00:55:49,978
when they retreat down.

1136
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:53,615
Yeah, well, it's kind of ein
bitch move, but whatevers.

1137
00:55:53,617 --> 00:55:56,118
Bitchy, bitchy, bitchy.

1138
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:57,853
Eh, fuck you guys.

1139
00:55:57,855 --> 00:56:00,589
Eh? Moosehead out.

1140
00:56:03,026 --> 00:56:05,394
Drink up, bitch,
salute the fuhrer--

1141
00:56:05,396 --> 00:56:06,762
Heil me, Heil me.

1142
00:56:06,764 --> 00:56:10,132
Are you playing beer pong?

1143
00:56:10,134 --> 00:56:11,433
[makes guttural sounds]

1144
00:56:11,435 --> 00:56:15,037
Can't hear you--
bad reception.

1145
00:56:15,039 --> 00:56:19,041
Now, where were we, Fraulein?

1146
00:56:26,249 --> 00:56:28,283
The werewolfs are
spreading fast.

1147
00:56:28,285 --> 00:56:30,853
That's why I came here
in person, he needs our help.

1148
00:56:30,855 --> 00:56:32,054
Have you ever met him?

1149
00:56:32,056 --> 00:56:34,356
No, but I heard he's
a big drinker.

1150
00:56:34,358 --> 00:56:35,691
Who isn't?

1151
00:56:35,693 --> 00:56:38,394
Well, I've invited Buford
and his wife to join us.

1152
00:56:38,396 --> 00:56:41,697
Hopefully,
he'll help break the ice.

1153
00:56:41,699 --> 00:56:43,098
Who's this--

1154
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:46,135
Frank, I came as soon
as I got your message.

1155
00:56:46,137 --> 00:56:49,338
Oh, hello, Congressman
Cleavon Baybridge Buford,

1156
00:56:49,340 --> 00:56:51,940
Repube, Georgia--
also vice-president

1157
00:56:51,942 --> 00:56:53,175
of the hot tub committee.

1158
00:56:53,177 --> 00:56:56,078
My wi-- well, I'm sorry,

1159
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:57,379
Dougie Mac, is that you?

1160
00:56:57,381 --> 00:57:00,015
No, I don't think we've met.

1161
00:57:00,017 --> 00:57:01,650
Oh, sure we have.

1162
00:57:01,652 --> 00:57:05,020
You did a cannonball
into the hot tub last week

1163
00:57:05,022 --> 00:57:06,855
when the Swiss delegates
were there.

1164
00:57:06,857 --> 00:57:09,892
No, I think you're thinking
of someone else.

1165
00:57:09,894 --> 00:57:12,094
You're hung like
a full-grown ox.

1166
00:57:12,096 --> 00:57:14,229
That's Dougie Mac!

1167
00:57:15,265 --> 00:57:17,866
Mr. President,
may I present to you,

1168
00:57:17,868 --> 00:57:20,068
Sir Winston Churchill.

1169
00:57:20,070 --> 00:57:22,037
You guys are drinking.

1170
00:57:22,039 --> 00:57:24,039
And during a time like this.

1171
00:57:24,041 --> 00:57:27,776
Jesus, honestly,
had I known this,

1172
00:57:29,045 --> 00:57:31,280
I would have come earlier.

1173
00:57:31,282 --> 00:57:33,615
Rosey, you old son of a bitch.

1174
00:57:33,617 --> 00:57:36,385
Oh, Winny, Winny,
it's nice to meet you.

1175
00:57:36,387 --> 00:57:38,053
Buford, would you pour him
a drink?

1176
00:57:38,055 --> 00:57:40,322
Yes, sir, in just
a moment, sir.

1177
00:57:40,324 --> 00:57:41,490
I bring my own.

1178
00:57:41,492 --> 00:57:43,459
Well, that's my kind
of man, yes.

1179
00:57:43,461 --> 00:57:47,129
Call this the Georgia sweet tea.

1180
00:57:49,432 --> 00:57:51,366
Thank you, Mrs. Buford.

1181
00:57:51,368 --> 00:57:55,237
Boy, this drink is as stiff
as a dead man's cock.

1182
00:57:55,239 --> 00:57:57,072
Thank you, sir.

1183
00:57:57,074 --> 00:57:58,273
I take great pride in that.

1184
00:57:58,275 --> 00:58:02,611
My father passed away
with an erection.

1185
00:58:03,146 --> 00:58:03,846
Look, Rosey,

1186
00:58:03,848 --> 00:58:06,548
I'm going to cut through
all the dumb shit--

1187
00:58:06,550 --> 00:58:08,116
we're at war.

1188
00:58:08,118 --> 00:58:10,652
And these goddamn werewolves
are getting

1189
00:58:10,654 --> 00:58:12,354
closer and closer to us
by the day.

1190
00:58:12,356 --> 00:58:15,424
So, what do you need
from The Delano?

1191
00:58:15,426 --> 00:58:17,459
Supplies, ammo, ships, tanks--

1192
00:58:17,461 --> 00:58:21,163
anything you can spare that will
stop these fucking things!

1193
00:58:21,165 --> 00:58:23,198
And look, we're the only ones

1194
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:24,833
who speak English
over in Europe.

1195
00:58:24,835 --> 00:58:26,702
You need us to be
werewolf free.

1196
00:58:26,704 --> 00:58:29,304
Ireland speaks English.

1197
00:58:31,508 --> 00:58:33,175
You need someone
you can understand.

1198
00:58:33,177 --> 00:58:34,376
Half the time I don't
even know

1199
00:58:34,378 --> 00:58:36,044
what these potato fuckers
are trying to say.

1200
00:58:36,046 --> 00:58:40,115
Look, just lend me something
that will blow their minds.

1201
00:58:40,117 --> 00:58:42,951
Fine, I will lend you my wife.

1202
00:58:42,953 --> 00:58:44,686
I will do it for my country.

1203
00:58:44,688 --> 00:58:46,221
Thank you dear lady.

1204
00:58:46,223 --> 00:58:48,257
But I actually need
real weapons.

1205
00:58:48,259 --> 00:58:50,659
Are you saying my wife's breasts
aren't real weapons?

1206
00:58:50,661 --> 00:58:51,960
They have killed lesser men.

1207
00:58:51,962 --> 00:58:54,796
They're powerful, sir, but I
need weapons

1208
00:58:54,798 --> 00:58:57,099
of steel and smoke and noise.

1209
00:58:57,101 --> 00:58:58,634
Well, you can motorboat them
if you want

1210
00:58:58,636 --> 00:58:59,868
and make your own noises.

1211
00:58:59,870 --> 00:59:01,403
Well, let me level
with you, Winnie--

1212
00:59:01,405 --> 00:59:04,873
I want those sons of bitches

1213
00:59:04,875 --> 00:59:06,842
wiped off the face of this earth

1214
00:59:06,844 --> 00:59:08,010
just as much as you do.

1215
00:59:08,012 --> 00:59:12,014
But I have to justify this
to the American people.

1216
00:59:15,618 --> 00:59:19,388
Dougie, do we got
any extra shit?

1217
00:59:19,390 --> 00:59:22,691
Sure, we can open up some more
defense plants too.

1218
00:59:22,693 --> 00:59:25,193
Frank, there's an election
coming up.

1219
00:59:25,195 --> 00:59:28,864
No offense, Mr. Churchill,
but we can't just
lend it to you.

1220
00:59:29,365 --> 00:59:31,266
But we could lease it to you.

1221
00:59:31,268 --> 00:59:35,037
And whatever you use,
you pay for.

1222
00:59:35,371 --> 00:59:37,472
So it would be sort of a--

1223
00:59:37,474 --> 00:59:40,309
a lend-lease kind of program?

1224
00:59:40,311 --> 00:59:42,177
Exactly.

1225
00:59:44,380 --> 00:59:45,714
You've got a deal!

1226
00:59:45,716 --> 00:59:50,319
Oh, damn, go Winnie!

1227
00:59:50,321 --> 00:59:51,687
Also, uh...

1228
00:59:51,689 --> 00:59:53,388
I could lease you my wife.

1229
00:59:53,390 --> 00:59:56,058
Yeah, whatever holes you use,
you pay for.

1230
00:59:56,060 --> 00:59:58,193
I think we'll all take
that deal.

1231
00:59:58,195 --> 00:59:59,161
To the hot tub!

1232
00:59:59,163 --> 01:00:01,263
Yes, sir, to the hot tub.

1233
01:00:03,232 --> 01:00:05,267
Did you bring cash?

1234
01:00:33,596 --> 01:00:35,731
Mr. President,
Uh-huh.

1235
01:00:35,733 --> 01:00:37,666
I have an urgent telegram
from Churchill.

1236
01:00:37,668 --> 01:00:39,067
Please read it aloud.

1237
01:00:39,069 --> 01:00:42,571
[shouts]
Rosey, it's me!

1238
01:00:42,573 --> 01:00:44,773
No, I didn't mean loud.

1239
01:00:44,775 --> 01:00:46,008
Just read it normally.

1240
01:00:46,010 --> 01:00:47,175
Rosey, it's me,

1241
01:00:47,177 --> 01:00:50,746
Winnie has his head stuck
in the honey pot on this one.

1242
01:00:50,748 --> 01:00:52,414
Need troops.

1243
01:00:52,416 --> 01:00:54,549
Send Miss Buford over too.

1244
01:00:54,551 --> 01:00:57,085
XO, W.C.

1245
01:00:57,087 --> 01:01:00,389
Oh, shit.

1246
01:01:00,391 --> 01:01:02,257
I was afraid of this.

1247
01:01:02,259 --> 01:01:07,195
I was trying to keep us
out of this damn war

1248
01:01:07,197 --> 01:01:09,498
as long as I could.

1249
01:01:11,501 --> 01:01:14,670
Being President
of the free world is--

1250
01:01:14,672 --> 01:01:17,339
oh, it's so stressful.

1251
01:01:17,341 --> 01:01:20,275
I bet-- sir, anything
that I can do?

1252
01:01:20,277 --> 01:01:22,744
How about a massage?

1253
01:01:22,746 --> 01:01:25,247
That would be rad.

1254
01:01:27,950 --> 01:01:29,217
No, what are you doing? Don't.

1255
01:01:29,219 --> 01:01:31,153
Don't, no, they're all
shriveled-up from polio.

1256
01:01:31,155 --> 01:01:36,091
I don't mind--
just sit and relax.
Don't-- don't.

1257
01:01:36,093 --> 01:01:38,794
Shh-hhh

1258
01:01:39,862 --> 01:01:42,130
Oh, God, that feels so good.

1259
01:01:42,132 --> 01:01:43,465
Oh, God.

1260
01:01:43,467 --> 01:01:47,135
Oh, my God.

1261
01:01:47,137 --> 01:01:47,936
[groans]

1262
01:01:47,938 --> 01:01:53,008
Eleanor hates my tiny, little,
shriveled-up polio legs.

1263
01:01:53,010 --> 01:01:54,710
I don't.

1264
01:01:54,712 --> 01:01:55,711
Oh God!

1265
01:01:55,713 --> 01:01:57,679
They remind me of home!

1266
01:01:57,681 --> 01:01:58,346
Huh?

1267
01:01:58,348 --> 01:02:00,348
I used to enter the hot dog
eating contest

1268
01:02:00,350 --> 01:02:02,784
every year at Coney Island.

1269
01:02:07,090 --> 01:02:09,357
So sexy!

1270
01:02:15,331 --> 01:02:18,700
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

1271
01:02:28,711 --> 01:02:31,079
[groans]

1272
01:02:31,081 --> 01:02:34,916
Tie me, Frank, tie me!

1273
01:02:47,630 --> 01:02:49,364
Frank,

1274
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:52,000
What the shit?

1275
01:02:52,002 --> 01:02:54,703
It's not what it seems, unh-unh.

1276
01:02:54,705 --> 01:02:55,804
Oh, it's not?

1277
01:02:55,806 --> 01:02:58,373
Because it looks like
your secretary is sucking

1278
01:02:58,375 --> 01:03:00,041
mustard and ketchup off of you.

1279
01:03:00,043 --> 01:03:01,076
Then it is what it seems.

1280
01:03:01,078 --> 01:03:04,780
And it looks
like Eleanor Roosevelt

1281
01:03:04,782 --> 01:03:07,949
is going to have
to strong arm a ho!

1282
01:03:09,085 --> 01:03:10,185
Get the fuck out of here,

1283
01:03:10,187 --> 01:03:12,754
I need to talk
to my husband, bitch!

1284
01:03:15,525 --> 01:03:17,459
Really, Franklin.

1285
01:03:17,461 --> 01:03:18,860
Jesus.

1286
01:03:18,862 --> 01:03:20,729
Oh, my God, just look
at yourself.

1287
01:03:20,731 --> 01:03:23,632
You are President
of the United States!

1288
01:03:23,634 --> 01:03:26,468
Frank! Ooh.
What is it, Louis?

1289
01:03:26,470 --> 01:03:29,070
MacArthur's here with General
Eisenhower-- says it's urgent.

1290
01:03:29,072 --> 01:03:31,706
Oh, of course,
it's always fucking urgent!

1291
01:03:31,708 --> 01:03:34,409
Well, I--
Well, I, oh-- by all means, go.

1292
01:03:34,411 --> 01:03:36,511
And if they ask you
what happened here,

1293
01:03:36,513 --> 01:03:42,384
just tell them a rainbow
took a shit on your legs.

1294
01:03:42,386 --> 01:03:44,252
[cries]

1295
01:03:46,422 --> 01:03:47,656
Do you have a handkerchief,
Louis?

1296
01:03:47,658 --> 01:03:51,326
I think it's going to take
a full-blown shower, chief.

1297
01:03:52,461 --> 01:03:54,663
Talk to her--
Eleanor's more important.

1298
01:03:54,665 --> 01:03:56,298
I'll make the Generals wait.

1299
01:03:56,300 --> 01:03:58,567
Jesus.

1300
01:03:58,569 --> 01:04:02,170
<i>General, General...</i>

1301
01:04:02,172 --> 01:04:05,507
<i>wait.</i>

1302
01:04:13,416 --> 01:04:16,184
Oh, so this is what
this room looks like.

1303
01:04:16,619 --> 01:04:19,387
I wouldn't know because you've
never let me sleep in here.

1304
01:04:19,389 --> 01:04:23,124
Don't you dare try to turn this
around on me.

1305
01:04:23,126 --> 01:04:25,627
I saw that whore on her knees

1306
01:04:25,629 --> 01:04:30,098
rubbing and moaning all over you
as she touched your le--

1307
01:04:30,100 --> 01:04:31,099
What?

1308
01:04:31,101 --> 01:04:33,068
My what, Eleanor?
Say it.

1309
01:04:33,070 --> 01:04:34,603
I want you to say it.

1310
01:04:34,605 --> 01:04:38,273
Your le-- le-- le--

1311
01:04:38,275 --> 01:04:43,511
Legs-- my tiny, little,
shriveled-up polio legs!

1312
01:04:43,513 --> 01:04:46,615
Eleanor, take a good look
at them!

1313
01:04:46,617 --> 01:04:48,116
No.

1314
01:04:48,118 --> 01:04:49,484
Look at them.

1315
01:04:49,486 --> 01:04:52,988
I can't, it's just
too hard, Frank.
Is it?

1316
01:04:52,990 --> 01:04:56,091
Is it hard for you, Eleanor?

1317
01:04:56,626 --> 01:04:58,593
What about me?

1318
01:04:59,629 --> 01:05:01,696
I'm stuck
in this damn wheelchair

1319
01:05:01,698 --> 01:05:02,898
for the rest of my life
with a wife

1320
01:05:02,900 --> 01:05:04,866
who doesn't want to have
sex with me.

1321
01:05:04,868 --> 01:05:07,269
I may be the only President

1322
01:05:07,271 --> 01:05:09,037
in the history
of the United States

1323
01:05:09,039 --> 01:05:11,907
who's never
gotten laid in office.

1324
01:05:12,608 --> 01:05:14,609
And this is my third term!

1325
01:05:14,611 --> 01:05:17,445
Now, am I going to ball
the secretary,

1326
01:05:17,447 --> 01:05:20,448
who obviously has daddy issues,
of course I am!

1327
01:05:20,450 --> 01:05:22,284
Because, at least,
she shows some interest in me.

1328
01:05:22,286 --> 01:05:25,921
Did you honestly believe
that I thought

1329
01:05:25,923 --> 01:05:28,056
that you had to tend
to the children

1330
01:05:28,058 --> 01:05:31,059
every night
for the last nine years?

1331
01:05:31,061 --> 01:05:33,461
Eleanor, we have one kid

1332
01:05:33,463 --> 01:05:36,398
who's old enough
to shit in a vase!

1333
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:38,433
I know.

1334
01:05:41,137 --> 01:05:43,438
Excuse me.

1335
01:05:44,473 --> 01:05:47,275
I have to go tend

1336
01:05:47,277 --> 01:05:50,645
to an entire nation.

1337
01:05:55,418 --> 01:05:58,386
Damn you, Frank!

1338
01:06:03,559 --> 01:06:05,060
At ease, gentlemen, sit.

1339
01:06:05,062 --> 01:06:07,462
What's the haps, Dougie Mac?

1340
01:06:08,164 --> 01:06:09,464
And who the fuck is this?

1341
01:06:09,466 --> 01:06:11,933
This is General
Dwight Eisenhower,

1342
01:06:11,935 --> 01:06:14,035
call sign-- Dew Drop.

1343
01:06:14,037 --> 01:06:15,236
Mr. President,

1344
01:06:15,238 --> 01:06:17,038
it is a pleasure for me
to be here--

1345
01:06:17,040 --> 01:06:19,941
Let's keep the pleasantries to
the left hand on your clam bag.

1346
01:06:19,943 --> 01:06:24,112
You know, I'm surprised to see
you boys here this late.

1347
01:06:24,114 --> 01:06:26,247
This better be important.

1348
01:06:26,249 --> 01:06:28,283
Well, sir, I only wish
we were here to tell you

1349
01:06:28,285 --> 01:06:31,653
about some hot dog eating
contest that's gone wrong.

1350
01:06:31,655 --> 01:06:33,488
But we're not.

1351
01:06:33,490 --> 01:06:37,058
What the fuck did you just say?

1352
01:06:38,194 --> 01:06:39,627
Come here.

1353
01:06:39,629 --> 01:06:41,696
Come here.

1354
01:06:45,601 --> 01:06:48,503
Come here-- a little closer.
Yes, sir.

1355
01:06:48,505 --> 01:06:52,073
I can fucking weigh you down,
pretty boy!

1356
01:06:52,075 --> 01:06:53,641
Mr. President!

1357
01:06:53,643 --> 01:06:56,878
Mr. President!
Mr. President!

1358
01:06:58,114 --> 01:07:00,081
Okay, all right.

1359
01:07:03,252 --> 01:07:05,286
You still got it, you old
son of a bitch-- good!

1360
01:07:05,288 --> 01:07:08,390
We're going to need
your spirit.
For what?

1361
01:07:08,392 --> 01:07:09,357
War!

1362
01:07:09,359 --> 01:07:11,526
I got this telegram
from Churchill.

1363
01:07:11,528 --> 01:07:13,294
Shit is fucked up
over there.

1364
01:07:13,296 --> 01:07:16,131
He's not going to be able
to hold out much longer.

1365
01:07:16,133 --> 01:07:18,133
They're converging from all
angles, Mr. President.

1366
01:07:18,135 --> 01:07:21,136
Germany has already taken
Austria, Czechoslovakia,

1367
01:07:21,138 --> 01:07:23,238
Poland, and France
is likely next.

1368
01:07:23,240 --> 01:07:24,672
Of course, they're pussies.

1369
01:07:24,674 --> 01:07:26,841
Japan has taken
complete control of China

1370
01:07:26,843 --> 01:07:29,110
and now, they're focusing
on Russia.

1371
01:07:29,112 --> 01:07:33,081
I also got a telegram
from Missy, from your secretary,

1372
01:07:33,083 --> 01:07:34,416
from the Prime Minister
of Ethiopia.

1373
01:07:34,418 --> 01:07:37,052
Italy has taken them over
and I dismissed it because--

1374
01:07:37,054 --> 01:07:39,554
Because it's fucking Ethiopia.

1375
01:07:40,289 --> 01:07:42,891
In all seriousness, sir,
I know you've been trying

1376
01:07:42,893 --> 01:07:44,793
to avoid going to war
for years, but now--

1377
01:07:44,795 --> 01:07:47,595
We must blast
their fucking asses!

1378
01:07:47,597 --> 01:07:51,266
Player to player, pimp to pimp,
I appreciate it.

1379
01:07:51,634 --> 01:07:54,369
Well, let me put my mind
on the grind

1380
01:07:54,371 --> 01:07:57,639
while you unwind--
just for tonight.

1381
01:07:57,940 --> 01:08:00,608
I'll go fireside
on their ass tomorrow

1382
01:08:00,610 --> 01:08:03,912
and when the American people
come home from work,

1383
01:08:03,914 --> 01:08:05,280
I'll tell them...

1384
01:08:05,282 --> 01:08:08,383
that we're going to war.

1385
01:08:08,385 --> 01:08:11,352
I want you two to strategize
a plan of attack.

1386
01:08:11,354 --> 01:08:13,521
And we'll reconvene at O. H.!

1387
01:08:13,523 --> 01:08:14,355
[both] R. O.!

1388
01:08:14,357 --> 01:08:17,592
I'll catch you
in the heart of things.

1389
01:08:17,594 --> 01:08:19,761
Mr. President.

1390
01:08:41,817 --> 01:08:44,319
Mr. President, do you need
anything before bed, sir?

1391
01:08:44,321 --> 01:08:46,488
You got anything that will
tell me what to do

1392
01:08:46,490 --> 01:08:48,389
with this fucking mess
I'm in, right now?

1393
01:08:48,391 --> 01:08:51,392
Third drawer down on the right--
Washington's humidor.

1394
01:08:51,394 --> 01:08:55,363
It'll give you advice
on everything you need to know.

1395
01:09:12,815 --> 01:09:18,019
What kind of shit
were you into, G-dubs?

1396
01:09:41,677 --> 01:09:43,511
Oh.

1397
01:09:46,749 --> 01:09:51,653
<i>[male voice]</i>
<i>Jane, Mary Jane,</i>
<i>Mary Jane, how I miss you.</i>

1398
01:09:51,655 --> 01:09:55,390
<i>Over here, boss.</i>

1399
01:09:56,559 --> 01:09:58,259
<i>You going to choke on that</i>
<i>like a prom date</i>

1400
01:09:58,261 --> 01:10:00,728
<i>or are you going to give</i>
<i>The Honest One some?</i>

1401
01:10:01,497 --> 01:10:04,465
Oh, shit, I'm high.

1402
01:10:04,467 --> 01:10:05,433
<i>Yeah, that's rad.</i>

1403
01:10:05,435 --> 01:10:07,068
Would you pass that dutchie
to the right-hand side--

1404
01:10:07,070 --> 01:10:10,238
I've been dead for 75 years
there, chief.

1405
01:10:15,578 --> 01:10:17,912
Thanks, dude.

1406
01:10:23,085 --> 01:10:25,086
Why don't you come with me?

1407
01:10:25,088 --> 01:10:27,555
We're going to talk.

1408
01:10:38,801 --> 01:10:40,635
Are you real?

1409
01:10:41,103 --> 01:10:45,440
No, only when other presidents
are in time of crisis

1410
01:10:45,442 --> 01:10:46,841
and need advice.

1411
01:10:46,843 --> 01:10:49,277
Oh, man, that is so cool.
Yeah.

1412
01:10:49,279 --> 01:10:51,879
There's this president
in the next century--
Uh-huh.

1413
01:10:51,881 --> 01:10:55,383
Obama-- he's going to be talking
to me a lot.

1414
01:10:55,385 --> 01:10:57,218
Oh, man, you got
a raw deal

1415
01:10:57,220 --> 01:11:00,655
with that whole
John Wilkes Booth thing.

1416
01:11:00,657 --> 01:11:05,093
Mary Todd had to go
to that fucking play.

1417
01:11:05,095 --> 01:11:05,793
Bitch.

1418
01:11:05,795 --> 01:11:07,328
Hey it sounds like
you did any better.

1419
01:11:07,330 --> 01:11:09,330
Where?
What has two wheels,

1420
01:11:09,332 --> 01:11:11,566
looks gay, and isn't a bicycle?

1421
01:11:11,568 --> 01:11:13,201
This guy.
D'oh!

1422
01:11:13,203 --> 01:11:14,936
Well played, sir,

1423
01:11:14,938 --> 01:11:17,772
well played.

1424
01:11:17,774 --> 01:11:22,076
Oh, fuck, Linc, I'm in a real
shit-pickle with the missus.

1425
01:11:22,078 --> 01:11:26,614
She caught me playing hide
the wrench in the steam engine

1426
01:11:26,616 --> 01:11:28,650
with my secretary.

1427
01:11:28,652 --> 01:11:30,084
I know, I saw that.

1428
01:11:30,086 --> 01:11:33,421
What?
You bastard, you were watching?

1429
01:11:33,423 --> 01:11:34,789
Of course.

1430
01:11:34,791 --> 01:11:36,324
You were about two minutes away

1431
01:11:36,326 --> 01:11:39,527
from her throwing your legs
over her head.

1432
01:11:41,363 --> 01:11:43,564
Somebody had told me
that the Japanese,

1433
01:11:43,566 --> 01:11:45,967
that their werewolves
are teaming up

1434
01:11:45,969 --> 01:11:50,171
with the German
and the Italian werewolves

1435
01:11:50,173 --> 01:11:52,106
and they're trying
to take over the world.

1436
01:11:52,108 --> 01:11:54,709
But I just can't
figure out why.

1437
01:11:54,711 --> 01:11:56,911
Now, you were attacked,
right?

1438
01:11:56,913 --> 01:12:01,883
Do you have any insight
on the werewolf tip?

1439
01:12:01,885 --> 01:12:07,155
Werewolves-- they're
telepathic-- always have been.

1440
01:12:07,157 --> 01:12:10,425
They can sense when someone's
born with true greatness--

1441
01:12:10,427 --> 01:12:12,760
someone who's a revolutionary.

1442
01:12:12,762 --> 01:12:14,462
That's what they see in you.

1443
01:12:14,464 --> 01:12:15,530
It's what they saw in me.

1444
01:12:15,532 --> 01:12:16,864
It's what they saw
in Washington.

1445
01:12:16,866 --> 01:12:18,733
Hey, what, did they attack
G-thing too?

1446
01:12:18,735 --> 01:12:22,303
That's why he left
his weed.

1447
01:12:22,305 --> 01:12:24,238
That's why I could have
this talk with him,

1448
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:26,307
and so, you could have
this talk with me.

1449
01:12:26,309 --> 01:12:28,242
Why didn't they go
after Woodrow?

1450
01:12:28,244 --> 01:12:32,280
Oh, I mean, he was, you know,
there for World War I.

1451
01:12:32,282 --> 01:12:33,581
That was a bitch war.

1452
01:12:33,583 --> 01:12:36,784
We really didn't need
to be in that shit.

1453
01:12:40,422 --> 01:12:43,291
G-dub was a rocking
revolutionary.

1454
01:12:43,293 --> 01:12:45,626
I laid the beat down on civil
and you're the man.

1455
01:12:45,628 --> 01:12:48,196
You are the man to lead us
through the deuce.

1456
01:12:48,198 --> 01:12:50,665
Oh, shit, I don't know
what the hell I'm doing.

1457
01:12:50,667 --> 01:12:53,267
I'm just freestyling
half the time.

1458
01:12:53,269 --> 01:12:55,870
I just do what I feel is right.

1459
01:12:55,872 --> 01:12:58,673
I didn't know what the fuck
I was doing.

1460
01:12:58,675 --> 01:12:59,841
Shit.

1461
01:12:59,843 --> 01:13:01,242
I thought so.

1462
01:13:01,244 --> 01:13:02,310
Don't worry, man,

1463
01:13:02,312 --> 01:13:04,479
I just did what I believed
in my heart.

1464
01:13:04,481 --> 01:13:06,080
You do the same
and you'll be straight.

1465
01:13:06,082 --> 01:13:10,284
You're one
cool motherfucker, Linc.

1466
01:13:10,286 --> 01:13:11,719
I know.

1467
01:13:11,721 --> 01:13:14,589
You are, man,
you are.

1468
01:13:14,591 --> 01:13:17,258
You want to see something cool?

1469
01:13:17,260 --> 01:13:19,460
What's that?

1470
01:13:19,462 --> 01:13:22,063
I can fucking fly.

1471
01:13:23,265 --> 01:13:25,800
This is awesome!
Isn't it?

1472
01:13:25,802 --> 01:13:29,237
Hey look, there's my monument.

1473
01:13:29,805 --> 01:13:32,607
Is there going to be a statue
like that of me?

1474
01:13:32,609 --> 01:13:34,142
No, no, no, but they're
going to name like,

1475
01:13:34,144 --> 01:13:37,245
a thousand high schools
after you.

1476
01:13:37,746 --> 01:13:40,281
That's cool.
Yes, it is.

1477
01:13:40,283 --> 01:13:42,517
Hey, Hey, check it out.

1478
01:13:42,519 --> 01:13:45,386
There's a hot dog vendor.
You-- you hungry?

1479
01:13:45,388 --> 01:13:49,157
Hey, FDR, this is for you,
Roosevelt.

1480
01:13:49,159 --> 01:13:51,459
Yeah!

1481
01:13:52,795 --> 01:13:55,329
Oh, you fucker!

1482
01:13:57,900 --> 01:14:00,268
[guffaws]

1483
01:14:00,270 --> 01:14:02,036
Oh, shit.
What?

1484
01:14:02,038 --> 01:14:03,871
Look at them.

1485
01:14:06,108 --> 01:14:07,608
What's up, Abe?

1486
01:14:07,610 --> 01:14:08,676
Thanks for freeing me.

1487
01:14:08,678 --> 01:14:10,678
Look, I'm fucking a white girl.

1488
01:14:10,680 --> 01:14:12,213
You're welcome.

1489
01:14:12,215 --> 01:14:13,815
Emancipate that ass.

1490
01:14:13,817 --> 01:14:15,783
You know this, kid.

1491
01:14:17,886 --> 01:14:20,455
God damnit, you are cool.
I know.

1492
01:14:20,457 --> 01:14:22,290
Here you go, Sam.

1493
01:14:22,292 --> 01:14:23,090
Who's that?

1494
01:14:23,092 --> 01:14:25,460
That's Uncle Sam,
the bald eagle of justice.

1495
01:14:25,462 --> 01:14:28,229
Why don't you grab on to those
wings and he'll carry you home.

1496
01:14:28,231 --> 01:14:30,565
Oh, no, no, no,
I'm too heavy.

1497
01:14:30,567 --> 01:14:34,101
No, if he can handle Taft,
he can certainly handle you.

1498
01:14:34,103 --> 01:14:35,102
Come on there, Frankie,

1499
01:14:35,104 --> 01:14:36,204
grab one of those wings
of justice.

1500
01:14:36,206 --> 01:14:38,940
Grab on and he'll take you home.
No, I can't.

1501
01:14:38,942 --> 01:14:40,541
No, I can't, no.
You can do it.

1502
01:14:40,543 --> 01:14:43,344
I can't, I can't--
oh, shit!

1503
01:14:45,614 --> 01:14:46,781
Hey!

1504
01:14:46,783 --> 01:14:50,084
You weren't honest at all!

1505
01:14:50,086 --> 01:14:52,720
[yells]

1506
01:14:56,625 --> 01:14:58,559
You okay, sir?

1507
01:14:59,094 --> 01:15:00,394
I had this weird dream.

1508
01:15:00,396 --> 01:15:04,198
Louis, get Dougie Mac
and Ike on the phone.

1509
01:15:04,200 --> 01:15:05,500
Right away, sir.

1510
01:15:05,502 --> 01:15:06,934
Scrambled eggs and sausage, sir?

1511
01:15:06,936 --> 01:15:08,603
You look like
you have the munchies.

1512
01:15:08,605 --> 01:15:10,538
Oh, that sounds good.

1513
01:15:11,273 --> 01:15:13,841
Jorge,
Si, senor.

1514
01:15:14,710 --> 01:15:16,143
Respect.

1515
01:15:16,145 --> 01:15:18,412
For what?

1516
01:15:29,091 --> 01:15:31,425
Let's get wet.

1517
01:15:31,427 --> 01:15:32,560
Louis, you got him?

1518
01:15:32,562 --> 01:15:35,663
Our drop point
is right here, gentlemen.

1519
01:15:35,665 --> 01:15:37,732
And once you hit
the ground

1520
01:15:37,734 --> 01:15:39,600
you have to hit
the ground running.

1521
01:15:39,602 --> 01:15:41,369
Our element
of surprise,

1522
01:15:41,371 --> 01:15:42,737
it's only going
to last so long

1523
01:15:42,739 --> 01:15:43,971
once they finally
figure out

1524
01:15:43,973 --> 01:15:48,175
that we're actually launching
a full-scale attack.

1525
01:15:52,514 --> 01:15:54,081
Attention!

1526
01:15:54,083 --> 01:15:55,483
I got it from here, Ike.

1527
01:15:55,485 --> 01:16:00,321
I know what you're thinking,
as you stare at that map.

1528
01:16:00,323 --> 01:16:01,756
Hell, I'm thinking
the same thing.

1529
01:16:01,758 --> 01:16:03,791
How in the world
are we going to storm

1530
01:16:03,793 --> 01:16:04,825
the beaches of Normandy,

1531
01:16:04,827 --> 01:16:08,029
take down an entire army
of werewolves,

1532
01:16:08,031 --> 01:16:12,233
and still make it to a French
titty-bar by last call?

1533
01:16:12,235 --> 01:16:14,735
At ease, gentlemen.

1534
01:16:14,737 --> 01:16:16,771
I am not going to tell you

1535
01:16:16,773 --> 01:16:20,441
that there aren't
going to be casualties,

1536
01:16:20,443 --> 01:16:22,543
or that it's going to be easy.

1537
01:16:22,545 --> 01:16:24,545
Because it's not.

1538
01:16:24,547 --> 01:16:30,318
Unfortunately, that is
the business of war.

1539
01:16:31,386 --> 01:16:33,955
I can't change that.

1540
01:16:34,590 --> 01:16:37,925
But I can lead by example.

1541
01:16:37,927 --> 01:16:40,661
And not the example
of somebody

1542
01:16:40,663 --> 01:16:42,863
who has survived
a werewolf attack

1543
01:16:42,865 --> 01:16:47,468
and now wheels back and forth
in front of you

1544
01:16:47,470 --> 01:16:51,138
like a God damn cripple
in a wheel chair!

1545
01:16:51,140 --> 01:16:55,643
That's right--
take a good look.

1546
01:16:57,646 --> 01:16:59,647
Cripple in a wheelchair!

1547
01:16:59,649 --> 01:17:01,415
Cripple in the wheelchair!

1548
01:17:01,417 --> 01:17:03,851
I could have heard that
my entire life

1549
01:17:03,853 --> 01:17:05,720
as people waited on me
hand and foot.

1550
01:17:05,722 --> 01:17:08,055
And there's nothing wrong
with that.

1551
01:17:08,057 --> 01:17:10,124
Except I wanted more--

1552
01:17:10,126 --> 01:17:14,362
I wanted to be the President
of the United States.

1553
01:17:14,364 --> 01:17:18,032
I wanted to lead
this great nation of ours

1554
01:17:18,034 --> 01:17:19,100
in its darkest hour.

1555
01:17:19,102 --> 01:17:23,037
And now I am going to lead
you into war.

1556
01:17:23,039 --> 01:17:26,841
I am going to fly
the first plane in

1557
01:17:26,843 --> 01:17:29,910
and lead our troops
onto the beach.

1558
01:17:29,912 --> 01:17:32,279
"Why would you do this?"
you might ask.

1559
01:17:32,281 --> 01:17:36,617
Not because I'm President
of the United States.

1560
01:17:36,619 --> 01:17:39,353
Not because it's
the heroic thing to do.

1561
01:17:39,355 --> 01:17:42,056
I am doing this to prove

1562
01:17:42,058 --> 01:17:43,824
to those werewolves,

1563
01:17:43,826 --> 01:17:45,960
that despite their attack,

1564
01:17:45,962 --> 01:17:48,629
I am not just
going to sit here

1565
01:17:48,631 --> 01:17:53,567
like some cripple
in a wheelchair!

1566
01:17:54,269 --> 01:17:55,269
Now look,

1567
01:17:55,271 --> 01:17:58,339
I know that you're scared.

1568
01:17:59,107 --> 01:18:01,676
Hell, I'm afraid too.

1569
01:18:04,012 --> 01:18:07,148
But I want you to remember...

1570
01:18:20,262 --> 01:18:24,732
we have nothing
to fear, but...

1571
01:18:25,300 --> 01:18:29,537
fear itself.

1572
01:18:30,138 --> 01:18:36,043
Now, let's go kick
some werewolf ass tomorrow!

1573
01:19:10,846 --> 01:19:13,647
Hito's been handled,
he won't bother us anymore.

1574
01:19:13,649 --> 01:19:15,282
Word.
Yep.

1575
01:19:15,284 --> 01:19:16,250
Fucking Einstein--

1576
01:19:16,252 --> 01:19:19,286
That project he was working on
in Manhattan is ready.

1577
01:19:22,023 --> 01:19:24,825
Way to go, Einstein.

1578
01:19:24,827 --> 01:19:25,726
Let me go with you.

1579
01:19:25,728 --> 01:19:28,896
No, Lou, The Delano's
got to do this on his own.

1580
01:19:28,898 --> 01:19:30,297
I'm a motorcycle of death.

1581
01:19:30,299 --> 01:19:32,633
I ain't got no sidecar.
I know.

1582
01:19:32,635 --> 01:19:35,269
Chair's all loaded
with silver Bs.

1583
01:19:35,271 --> 01:19:36,437
Rockets are loaded.

1584
01:19:36,439 --> 01:19:39,039
You're all set.
Thanks, man.

1585

to know,

if anything happens to me,

1587
01:19:44,613 --> 01:19:46,614
take care of my mistress,
will you?

1588
01:19:46,616 --> 01:19:47,448
I have a spare key

1589
01:19:47,450 --> 01:19:48,883
for the Lincoln bedroom
underneath the mat,

1590
01:19:48,885 --> 01:19:52,219

the sheets first, though.

1591
01:19:52,221 --> 01:19:54,054
Okay.

1592
01:19:54,056 --> 01:19:55,890

That is enough, George.

01:28:35,177 --> 01:28:36,476
and most of their soldiers.

1759
01:28:36,478 --> 01:28:39,713
I was cool until I had to wheel
myself out of there.

1760
01:28:39,715 --> 01:28:41,548
Do you know how hard it is

1761
01:28:41,550 --> 01:28:44,484
to maneuver a wheelchair
through sand?

1762
01:28:44,486 --> 01:28:47,254
[laughs]

1763
01:28:47,256 --> 01:28:48,355
Eleanor, are you okay?

1764
01:28:48,357 --> 01:28:50,190
You haven't said anything.

1765
01:28:50,192 --> 01:28:51,692
Aren't you happy to see me?

1766
01:28:51,694 --> 01:28:52,659
Damn you, damn you,

1767
01:28:52,661 --> 01:28:55,262
don't you ever put me through
anything like that again!

1768
01:28:55,264 --> 01:28:57,297
Ooh, come here!

1769
01:28:57,299 --> 01:28:59,166
Come here.

1770
01:28:59,168 --> 01:29:01,868
[bawls]

1771
01:29:03,604 --> 01:29:05,038
Sh-hhh, I told you, baby,

1772
01:29:05,040 --> 01:29:09,810
ain't nobody going to take down
The Delano.

1773
01:29:11,779 --> 01:29:14,748
I'm going to ride you
like a free pony

1774
01:29:14,750 --> 01:29:16,817
at the state fair,
tonight.

1775
01:29:16,819 --> 01:29:19,419
Frank, should we leave?

1776
01:29:19,421 --> 01:29:20,554
I'm cool to stay.

1777
01:29:20,556 --> 01:29:23,023
Oh, no, actually, George,

1778
01:29:23,025 --> 01:29:25,692
I want you to rig up the radio.

1779
01:29:25,694 --> 01:29:29,329
Daddy wants to go fireside.

1780
01:29:29,331 --> 01:29:30,330
Right away, sir.

1781
01:29:30,332 --> 01:29:33,200
Back in the saddle, Frankie.

1782
01:29:43,044 --> 01:29:44,277
My fellow Americans,

1783
01:29:44,279 --> 01:29:50,250
<i>[radio]</i>
<i>this is your President,</i>
<i>Franklin Delano Roosevelt.</i>

1784
01:29:50,252 --> 01:29:54,654
<i>As you know, we are at war.</i>

1785
01:29:54,656 --> 01:29:56,556
<i>And as your President,</i>

1786
01:29:56,558 --> 01:30:01,061
<i>I felt the need to lead</i>
<i>our troops into battle--</i>

1787
01:30:01,063 --> 01:30:05,899
<i>a battle which</i>
<i>we successfully won.</i>

1788
01:30:05,901 --> 01:30:09,569
<i>The fight against werewolves</i>
<i>is over!</i>

1789
01:30:09,571 --> 01:30:13,607
<i>For those of you who thought</i>
<i>I was gone,</i>

1790
01:30:13,609 --> 01:30:17,377
allow me to reintroduce
myself--

1791
01:30:17,379 --> 01:30:22,249
It's Franklin Delano Roosevelt,
motherfucker!
