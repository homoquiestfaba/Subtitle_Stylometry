00:00:24,177 --> 00:00:26,046
Tony: (over phone) <i>Tasha, baby?</i>

3
00:00:26,179 --> 00:00:27,848
Tasha: (over phone)
<i>Yeah, Tony, what is it?</i>

4
00:00:27,981 --> 00:00:30,649
Tony: <i>Let's run away tonight.</i>
(breathes heavily)

5
00:00:32,118 --> 00:00:33,019
<i>Baby?</i>

6
00:00:33,954 --> 00:00:36,056
Hello? Hello?

7
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:39,425
- Hello, are you there?
- Tasha: <i>Yeah, I'm here.</i>

8
00:00:39,558 --> 00:00:42,295
Oh, did you lose service
or something?

9
00:00:42,428 --> 00:00:44,030
Tasha: <i>No, it's got full bars.</i>

10
00:00:44,164 --> 00:00:45,165
Oh, okay.

11
00:00:45,298 --> 00:00:46,432
Tasha: <i>I can hear you just fine.</i>

12
00:00:46,565 --> 00:00:48,001
Okay, cool, cool, cool.

13
00:00:48,134 --> 00:00:51,872
Yeah, I'll pick you up in 20
and we can be in Baja.

14
00:00:52,005 --> 00:00:54,908
- 10:00 a.m. tomorrow morning...
- Tasha: <i>Wait, wait, hold on,</i>

15
00:00:55,041 --> 00:00:56,642
<i>Tony,
what are you talking about?</i>

16
00:00:56,877 --> 00:00:58,979
Do you have any sunscreen?
I forgot to get some sunscreen.

17
00:00:59,112 --> 00:01:00,679
Tasha: <i>Tony, are you being
serious right now?</i>

18
00:01:00,813 --> 00:01:02,949
Remember when I said that
I wanted to run away

19
00:01:03,083 --> 00:01:04,351
with you to Mexico?

20
00:01:04,483 --> 00:01:07,486
- Tasha: <i>Tony, what?</i>
- You said... You said yes.

21
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:08,922
I thought.

22
00:01:09,189 --> 00:01:10,389
Tasha: <i>Tony, why would you
believe anything</i>

23
00:01:10,522 --> 00:01:11,790
<i>anyone says on the first date?</i>

24
00:01:11,925 --> 00:01:13,726
Because you said you knew from
the start

25
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,096
we were meant to be together
and we'd be together forever,

26
00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:18,899
so, you know, I just thought we
should take the next step.

27
00:01:19,032 --> 00:01:21,533
Tasha: (chuckles)
<i>I was three margaritas in</i>

28
00:01:21,667 --> 00:01:23,435
<i>by the time you showed up.</i>

29
00:01:23,569 --> 00:01:25,105
...filter over
your true emotions.

30
00:01:25,272 --> 00:01:26,940
Tasha: <i>Tony, you don't even
have a car, how would...</i>

31
00:01:27,073 --> 00:01:29,009
Tony: <i>No, no, no.
It's all good. It's all good.</i>

32
00:01:29,142 --> 00:01:30,143
<i>I got a ride now.</i>

33
00:01:30,277 --> 00:01:31,677
Tasha: <i>What, your grandma's car?</i>

34
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:33,445
Tony: <i>No, no,
I'm borrowing my friend's car.</i>

35
00:01:33,612 --> 00:01:35,547
<i>I just left it at his house
and I gotta go back and get it.</i>

36
00:01:35,681 --> 00:01:36,950
Tasha: <i>Tony...</i>

37
00:01:37,217 --> 00:01:38,784
Look, look, I got everything
taken care of, I swear.

38
00:01:38,919 --> 00:01:40,153
Tasha: <i>Tony, listen,
I can't leave tonight.</i>

39
00:01:40,287 --> 00:01:41,922
<i>I just ordered
a really big pizza.</i>

40
00:01:42,055 --> 00:01:43,756
- <i>Like a really big pizza.</i>
- <i>Baby, look...</i>

41
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:45,791
<i>And I really wanna eat it
fresh. It's on the way.</i>

42
00:01:45,926 --> 00:01:49,095
I'm kinda committed
to this whole Mexico thing.

43
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:51,463
Tasha: <i>Committed? What do you
mean committed?</i>

44
00:01:51,597 --> 00:01:53,033
<i>You told me on the first date</i>

45
00:01:53,166 --> 00:01:55,467
<i>that you weren't a commitment
type of guy.</i>

46
00:01:55,601 --> 00:01:57,003
Tony: <i>No, no, no.
It's all good.</i>

47
00:01:57,137 --> 00:01:58,537
Tasha: <i>I don't even have
a passport.</i>

48
00:01:58,671 --> 00:01:59,940
<i>Do you have a passport?</i>

49
00:02:00,073 --> 00:02:01,241
Tony: <i>You don't need one
for Mexico.</i>

50
00:02:01,374 --> 00:02:02,708
Davis: He's not alone anymore.

51
00:02:02,876 --> 00:02:04,210
Tasha: <i>Are you sure
that's how it works?</i>

52
00:02:04,344 --> 00:02:05,444
Tony: <i>Tasha.</i>

53
00:02:06,379 --> 00:02:07,780
Tasha, please.

54
00:02:07,914 --> 00:02:11,117
The love I feel for you is like
nothing I've ever felt.

55
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:14,220
It is more warm and pure

56
00:02:14,354 --> 00:02:18,325
than the sand on the most
beautiful fucking Mexican beach.

57
00:02:18,457 --> 00:02:22,795
Just... Just come away with me.
Come away with me and I swear,

58
00:02:22,929 --> 00:02:26,598
I swear that you will feel the warmth
of my love for the rest of your...

59
00:02:26,732 --> 00:02:28,801
Tasha: <i>Hang on.
My pizza's here.</i>

60
00:02:28,935 --> 00:02:30,136
<i>I'll be right back.</i>

61
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:32,105
- (glass shattering)
- (indistinct chatter)

62
00:02:33,472 --> 00:02:34,673
Woman: Are you sure he's home?

63
00:02:34,807 --> 00:02:36,142
Man: Jesus Christ,
what do you mean?

64
00:02:36,376 --> 00:02:37,844
Of course, he's here.
What else does this idiot...

65
00:02:37,978 --> 00:02:39,312
There he is! There he is!
There he is!

66
00:02:39,446 --> 00:02:40,447
(indistinct chatter)

67
00:02:40,612 --> 00:02:42,015
(banging on door)

68
00:02:42,148 --> 00:02:43,316
Woman: Kick it down.

69
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:45,051
Man: No, I'm not gonna kick the
fucking door down.

70
00:02:45,185 --> 00:02:46,987
I want the motherfucker to open
the door,

71
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,255
invite me in,
so, I can kick his ass.

72
00:02:49,389 --> 00:02:51,091
Woman: What the fuck?
What the fuck are you...

73
00:02:51,224 --> 00:02:52,791
- Hey! Hey!
- Man: Get out of my way.

74
00:02:52,926 --> 00:02:54,394
- Get the fuck...
- (gunshot)

75
00:02:54,526 --> 00:02:56,762
- Woman: Goddamn it!
- Man: Will you just back off?

76
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:57,796
Woman: Kick it down,
you mother...

77
00:02:57,931 --> 00:02:59,232
Man: I said back off!

78
00:02:59,366 --> 00:03:02,035
Woman: You're gonna
fucking shoot him. Wait!

79
00:03:02,534 --> 00:03:04,137
- (thud)
- Man: All up in my shit.

80
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:05,438
Now back the fuck off!

81
00:03:05,571 --> 00:03:07,240
Woman:
Gotta fucking pull a gun out

82
00:03:07,374 --> 00:03:09,708
all the goddamn time,
like it's your dick or something.

83
00:03:09,843 --> 00:03:11,177
Man: Yes,
get the fuck away from me.

84
00:03:11,311 --> 00:03:12,912
It's my responsibility.

85
00:03:13,446 --> 00:03:15,315
Tasha: <i>Hey, Tony, I'm back.</i>

86
00:03:15,748 --> 00:03:18,084
<i>So, I've been doing
some thinking</i>

87
00:03:18,218 --> 00:03:21,955
<i>and...
I think we should break up.</i>

88
00:03:23,223 --> 00:03:26,092
<i>I just feel like we're not on
the same page.</i>

89
00:03:26,226 --> 00:03:28,560
<i>Like, we live in two different
worlds, you know?</i>

90
00:03:29,195 --> 00:03:32,698
<i>And, like, not just Mexico
and America.</i>

91
00:03:35,567 --> 00:03:36,668
<i>Tony?</i>

92
00:03:38,204 --> 00:03:39,205
<i>Hello?</i>

93
00:03:41,007 --> 00:03:42,842
<i>Well, I'll just text you. Bye.</i>

94
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:46,079
(somber guitar music plays)

95
00:03:55,788 --> 00:03:58,191
(grunting)

96
00:04:14,507 --> 00:04:17,143
I don't really feel like doing
the homework.

97
00:04:17,277 --> 00:04:20,746
That's like 15 minutes
out of my day.

98
00:04:22,215 --> 00:04:23,283
I don't know.

99
00:04:24,417 --> 00:04:27,887
You know, I was thinking about
dropping out of math.

100
00:04:28,021 --> 00:04:29,189
(punch bag thudding)

101
00:04:29,322 --> 00:04:30,924
I don't really like it.
English, too.

102
00:04:31,057 --> 00:04:32,992
Let's drop out of English.

103
00:04:33,126 --> 00:04:36,628
Actually,
I should just drop out entirely.

104
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:39,532
Save the taxpayers
a couple of bucks...

105
00:04:39,665 --> 00:04:42,102
(grunting)

106
00:04:47,806 --> 00:04:50,742
Mike, you might wanna watch out
for that car.

107
00:04:51,344 --> 00:04:52,245
Mike!

108
00:04:52,811 --> 00:04:53,913
Mike!

109
00:04:55,381 --> 00:04:56,249
Mike, watch out!

110
00:04:56,382 --> 00:04:58,017
(tires screeching)

111
00:04:58,952 --> 00:05:01,955
(rock music plays)

112
00:05:02,088 --> 00:05:03,622
(groans)

113
00:05:06,126 --> 00:05:07,393
(grunts)

114
00:05:08,228 --> 00:05:08,928
Kelsey: Mike?

115
00:05:09,062 --> 00:05:10,796
Kelsey, hi, how you doing?

116
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:12,098
Are you okay?

117
00:05:12,631 --> 00:05:14,800
Whoa. You all right, buddy?
You know, you gotta watch out,

118
00:05:14,934 --> 00:05:17,036
it's a blind corner right here.
(chuckles)

119
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:19,272
You good?
Yeah, I'm good.

120
00:05:19,405 --> 00:05:21,975
Chet: You're good, brother.
Yo, Kelsey.

121
00:05:22,408 --> 00:05:23,877
Chet.

122
00:05:24,344 --> 00:05:25,777
I imagine a busy girl like
yourself doesn't have too much time

123
00:05:25,912 --> 00:05:27,746
to prep for the calc final,
am I right?

124
00:05:27,881 --> 00:05:29,115
Kelsey: Well,
pointless chit chat with you

125
00:05:29,315 --> 00:05:30,816
does kinda eat away
at my free time.

126
00:05:31,017 --> 00:05:33,652
Let's study together.
Just name a day.

127
00:05:34,786 --> 00:05:36,422
Sure, why not.

128
00:05:36,556 --> 00:05:39,658
How about the second Tuesday
of next week.

129
00:05:44,864 --> 00:05:46,065
What day is that?

130
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:48,700
Oh, it's the 15th... of never.

131
00:05:48,835 --> 00:05:50,069
Man: Is there two Tuesdays
next week?

132
00:05:50,203 --> 00:05:51,871
Hey, Kelsey, for real though.

133
00:05:52,005 --> 00:05:54,040
Hey, if you need a study buddy
let me...

134
00:05:54,374 --> 00:05:55,375
(garage door whirs)

135
00:05:55,508 --> 00:05:57,443
I'll break her eventually.
(chuckles)

136
00:05:57,577 --> 00:05:59,279
Man: Yeah, you'll break her
eventually.

137
00:06:01,514 --> 00:06:04,050
- Chet: Cute ride.
- Man: Cute ride, bro.

138
00:06:04,683 --> 00:06:09,122
I'm hungry.
Fuck, let's go.

139
00:06:23,136 --> 00:06:26,506
Dude, your mom makes bomb
chimichangas.

140
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:27,974
That's not the last one is it?

141
00:06:28,107 --> 00:06:30,009
No, there should be some more
out there.

142
00:06:36,849 --> 00:06:38,084
So...

143
00:06:38,717 --> 00:06:40,119
when are you gonna ask her out?

144
00:06:40,386 --> 00:06:41,820
Uh... What?

145
00:06:42,222 --> 00:06:44,190
When are you going to
ask her out?

146
00:06:44,524 --> 00:06:47,594
I mean, her names your freaking
email password, fuck's sake.

147
00:06:47,726 --> 00:06:49,128
Why do you know my email...

148
00:06:49,262 --> 00:06:50,930
Don't worry about semantics.

149
00:06:51,164 --> 00:06:54,567
Listen, pick up your phone,
call her, get a date with her.

150
00:06:54,766 --> 00:06:56,236
I... I don't,
I don't have her number.

151
00:06:56,369 --> 00:06:57,337
It's cool, I do.

152
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:58,972
Wait,
how do you have her number?

153
00:06:59,105 --> 00:07:00,406
Stole Janice's phone in bio.

154
00:07:01,107 --> 00:07:02,475
You stole Janice's phone?

155
00:07:02,609 --> 00:07:04,544
- Yeah. We worked it out.
- That's just not...

156
00:07:04,677 --> 00:07:06,179
We're going on a date tonight.

157
00:07:09,015 --> 00:07:10,883
Let's go, Mike, chop chop.

158
00:07:15,754 --> 00:07:16,889
I lost my phone.

159
00:07:17,123 --> 00:07:19,025
Underneath your clothes,
by the desk.

160
00:07:21,127 --> 00:07:23,696
- How did you know it...
- They got an app for that.

161
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:25,164
Dude, why are you tracking my...

162
00:07:25,298 --> 00:07:26,866
Brett: 'Cause you lose
everything you touch.

163
00:07:27,033 --> 00:07:29,469
You'd lose your ball sack if it
wasn't attached to you.

164
00:07:29,602 --> 00:07:32,872
Look, you're still not doing
what I told you.

165
00:07:33,006 --> 00:07:35,508
Call her, it's not hard.
Let's go step by step.

166
00:07:35,942 --> 00:07:39,145
Dial 555-1138.

167
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:41,114
You're gonna press call,
you're gonna take the phone

168
00:07:41,247 --> 00:07:44,350
up to your ear, it's gonna ring
once, twice, three times.

169
00:07:44,484 --> 00:07:45,551
Don't be alarmed.

170
00:07:45,685 --> 00:07:47,153
She might just be getting out of
the shower,

171
00:07:47,287 --> 00:07:49,889
about to wrap that towel around
her upper body,

172
00:07:50,023 --> 00:07:51,991
and then she's gonna pick up on
the fourth ring.

173
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:54,894
Mike, I don't have all day.

174
00:07:56,629 --> 00:07:59,165
On that fourth ring,
you get to talk to her.

175
00:07:59,299 --> 00:08:00,767
But if it goes on
for a fifth ring,

176
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:03,202
then she might not pick up,
'cause on the sixth ring

177
00:08:03,336 --> 00:08:05,705
it clicks dead,
but I wouldn't worry about that

178
00:08:05,838 --> 00:08:06,706
if I were you.

179
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:09,808
(phone ringing)

180
00:08:18,184 --> 00:08:19,319
Kelsey: (over phone) <i>Hello?</i>

181
00:08:19,452 --> 00:08:21,454
(splutters) Go, go, go.
Pick it up.

182
00:08:21,587 --> 00:08:23,189
- Kelsey: <i>Hello?</i>
- Hello, Kelsey...

183
00:08:23,323 --> 00:08:24,924
No, I'm not interested in buying
industrial strength

184
00:08:25,058 --> 00:08:26,359
commercial size garbage bags.

185
00:08:26,492 --> 00:08:28,528
- <i>Thanks. Stop calling.</i>
- Oh, no, no, no.

186
00:08:28,661 --> 00:08:31,597
It's Mike. Mike from school.

187
00:08:32,532 --> 00:08:33,433
Mike?

188
00:08:33,566 --> 00:08:34,901
Yup.

189
00:08:35,068 --> 00:08:36,469
Kelsey: <i>Hey I didn't realize you
had my number.</i>

190
00:08:36,602 --> 00:08:38,237
- Brett: Give it to me...
- I can't lie to you.

191
00:08:38,371 --> 00:08:39,906
Brett stole your phone number
from Janice's phone.

192
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:41,307
Brett: <i>Oh, my fucking God.</i>
Hey, Donna...

193
00:08:41,441 --> 00:08:43,609
have you seen your son's
ball sack anywhere?

194
00:08:43,776 --> 00:08:45,578
Did you just yell "ball sack"?

195
00:08:45,712 --> 00:08:47,780
- No, no, no.
- I swear I just heard "ball sack."

196
00:08:47,914 --> 00:08:48,815
It was Brett.

197
00:08:48,948 --> 00:08:50,249
Brett has your ball sack?

198
00:08:50,383 --> 00:08:52,051
No, he was saying if my mom seen
my ball sack.

199
00:08:52,185 --> 00:08:54,420
Your ball sack or his ball?
I'm confused.

200
00:08:54,554 --> 00:08:56,956
It was a metaphor. Uh...

201
00:08:59,692 --> 00:09:01,894
Yeah, that's a...
that's a problem.

202
00:09:02,495 --> 00:09:04,764
<i>Okay, look, just think back.</i>

203
00:09:04,897 --> 00:09:06,132
Let's retrace your steps.

204
00:09:06,265 --> 00:09:10,236
Where do you feel
like you last felt them?

205
00:09:11,904 --> 00:09:13,473
I... I... I...

206
00:09:13,973 --> 00:09:15,408
Tell me you found them.

207
00:09:17,577 --> 00:09:18,578
Yup.

208
00:09:18,711 --> 00:09:19,779
That was a close call.

209
00:09:20,146 --> 00:09:21,581
I have my balls.

210
00:09:23,816 --> 00:09:27,420
- So, is that why you called?
- No, no. Uh...

211
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,389
I, um...

212
00:09:32,258 --> 00:09:34,961
(mellow guitar music plays)

213
00:09:36,229 --> 00:09:38,030
I like your music.

214
00:09:38,898 --> 00:09:41,768
It's Jackson and Jackie.

215
00:09:42,201 --> 00:09:44,203
Here, listen.

216
00:09:55,581 --> 00:09:57,517
It's an eight-track player,
by the way.

217
00:09:57,650 --> 00:09:58,751
Eight-track?

218
00:09:58,886 --> 00:10:00,286
Kelsey: <i>Yeah.</i>

219
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:03,022
Yeah, I actually pulled it out
of the dumpster this morning.

220
00:10:03,156 --> 00:10:04,357
Secretly.

221
00:10:04,924 --> 00:10:06,092
Why secretly?

222
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:12,231
Well, uh, my mom threw it away,
and when she throws things away

223
00:10:12,365 --> 00:10:14,367
she never
wants to see them again.

224
00:10:15,401 --> 00:10:18,104
She threw out
a bunch of old stuff, actually.

225
00:10:18,237 --> 00:10:22,141
There's a VHS player
with a tape inside.

226
00:10:22,275 --> 00:10:23,877
Oh, which... which, uh, tape?

227
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:25,945
<i>Titanic,</i> tape one.

228
00:10:29,215 --> 00:10:31,117
Seriously, I mean,
how have we not talked

229
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:34,454
since, like, what, eighth grade?

230
00:10:35,788 --> 00:10:37,557
I don't know, uh...

231
00:10:38,057 --> 00:10:39,659
Woman: <i>Kelsey!</i>

232
00:10:39,792 --> 00:10:41,694
<i>Where the hell are you?
Get in here.</i>

233
00:10:41,829 --> 00:10:45,998
<i>I wanted this kitchen clean.
This floor does not look clean.</i>

234
00:10:46,132 --> 00:10:47,300
<i>How did I get stuck
with a kid...</i>

235
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,669
Kelsey: <i>I'll be right there.</i>

236
00:10:49,802 --> 00:10:52,538
- (woman shouts indistinctly)
- Hey, Mike, I gotta go.

237
00:10:52,672 --> 00:10:53,874
- Woman: <i>Kelsey!</i>
- Kelsey: Sorry.

238
00:10:54,006 --> 00:10:55,741
Oh, yeah, no... no problem.

239
00:10:58,344 --> 00:11:01,481
Do you... Are you busy later?

240
00:11:02,081 --> 00:11:03,951
Uh... No.

241
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:05,218
No plans.

242
00:11:05,351 --> 00:11:07,019
Do you want to hang out?

243
00:11:09,555 --> 00:11:10,590
Yeah.

244
00:11:11,824 --> 00:11:12,960
(clears throat) Yeah.

245
00:11:13,092 --> 00:11:14,828
Pick me up at seven?

246
00:11:14,962 --> 00:11:16,128
Yeah. Cool, I can do that.

247
00:11:16,262 --> 00:11:18,130
Cool, I'll see you tonight.

248
00:11:19,065 --> 00:11:20,566
See... See you tonight.

249
00:11:21,234 --> 00:11:22,502
- Woman: <i>Kelsey!</i>
- (banging on door)

250
00:11:22,635 --> 00:11:24,036
<i>Who the hell are you
talking to?</i>

251
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:25,771
<i>Get off the phone...</i>

252
00:11:25,906 --> 00:11:27,273
Brett: "See you tonight"?

253
00:11:27,406 --> 00:11:29,408
You're seeing her tonight?

254
00:11:29,542 --> 00:11:31,077
I'm seeing her tonight, dude.

255
00:11:31,244 --> 00:11:32,645
- You picking her up?
- (sighs) Yeah.

256
00:11:32,778 --> 00:11:34,347
What car are you gonna use,
the invisible one?

257
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,082
- I'll just drive the van.
- Big back seat, nice.

258
00:11:36,516 --> 00:11:38,251
- Except one problem.
- What?

259
00:11:38,384 --> 00:11:39,785
Your parents are leaving for
Vegas.

260
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:40,921
No.

261
00:11:41,287 --> 00:11:42,755
There's food in the fridge.
All right?

262
00:11:42,956 --> 00:11:44,056
You know what, Brett ate your
last chimichanga, though.

263
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:45,658
I'm sorry. Have fun.

264
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,360
- There's beer in the refrigerator.
- Mm-hm.

265
00:11:47,527 --> 00:11:48,160
If you want to have a party,
I'm okay with that.

266
00:11:48,294 --> 00:11:49,462
But I'm...

267
00:11:50,229 --> 00:11:51,664
I do not want any feet on my coffee table.
That's my one rule, okay?

268
00:11:51,797 --> 00:11:53,165
I just...
I needed to borrow the car,

269
00:11:53,299 --> 00:11:55,601
'cause I have...
(sighs) I have a date.

270
00:11:55,735 --> 00:11:57,069
- (gasps)
- You have a date?

271
00:11:57,203 --> 00:11:58,839
- Michael!
- My man.

272
00:11:58,972 --> 00:12:00,506
- Mom: That is great.
- Dad: Good for you.

273
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,241
You know what,
there's condoms upstairs

274
00:12:02,775 --> 00:12:04,243
on your dads bedside table,
so if you need to use 'em, get to it.

275
00:12:04,377 --> 00:12:05,879
Hey, we don't want
to become grandparents.

276
00:12:06,013 --> 00:12:07,014
We sure don't, all right?

277
00:12:07,146 --> 00:12:08,047
- But...
- You take care.

278
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:09,016
Mom: Have fun, baby.

279
00:12:09,148 --> 00:12:11,050
(tires screeching)

280
00:12:15,721 --> 00:12:16,689
(rock music plays)

281
00:12:17,323 --> 00:12:19,492
Well, date's off.

282
00:12:20,928 --> 00:12:24,096
No, it's not, dude.
You give up too quick. Check it.

283
00:12:29,937 --> 00:12:31,939
Plain paint job, nice rims.

284
00:12:32,071 --> 00:12:33,239
Got a working AC.

285
00:12:33,372 --> 00:12:35,976
Not bad looking
for a starter car.

286
00:12:36,676 --> 00:12:39,245
You can swing, uh, three grand,
right?

287
00:12:43,884 --> 00:12:47,988
Can you just like stop being you
for like two seconds?

288
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,589
Is that doable, maybe?

289
00:12:51,223 --> 00:12:53,159
Mike: I only have 2,700.

290
00:12:53,326 --> 00:12:54,427
Uh... Check your dad's
condom drawer.

291
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,596
I think he has some cash
in there.

292
00:12:57,296 --> 00:12:58,598
- Mike: What?
- Dude.

293
00:12:58,865 --> 00:13:00,099
I have a date tonight.

294
00:13:00,533 --> 00:13:02,702
I can't steal from my parents.

295
00:13:02,836 --> 00:13:04,071
It's not stealing.

296
00:13:04,503 --> 00:13:06,073
It's borrowing, and our whole
economy's built off that.

297
00:13:06,205 --> 00:13:08,441
And... sent.

298
00:13:08,842 --> 00:13:11,310
Some guy named Dennis expects
you in the morning,

299
00:13:11,444 --> 00:13:14,881
or nowish, I don't know,
I told him "some time."

300
00:13:15,015 --> 00:13:16,248
Are you ready to own a vehicle?

301
00:13:16,382 --> 00:13:18,150
Are you ready to be
better than Chet?

302
00:13:18,284 --> 00:13:19,685
Well, not better,
he's better looking,

303
00:13:19,819 --> 00:13:22,388
has a better car,
and is probably gonna end up

304
00:13:22,521 --> 00:13:25,257
taking your girl out,
wining, dining, 69-ing.

305
00:13:25,391 --> 00:13:27,793
That's how my dad met my mom.

306
00:13:28,996 --> 00:13:30,329
Are you my dad?

307
00:13:30,496 --> 00:13:32,465
Or are you the guy
that could have been my dad?

308
00:13:33,399 --> 00:13:36,636
(mellow guitar music plays)

309
00:14:07,767 --> 00:14:08,801
(door unlocks)

310
00:14:09,669 --> 00:14:12,171
- Hi there.
- Uh... Hi.

311
00:14:12,805 --> 00:14:13,806
How's it going?

312
00:14:14,007 --> 00:14:15,307
Good, good.

313
00:14:19,545 --> 00:14:20,981
- That's mine.
- Oh, uh...

314
00:14:21,114 --> 00:14:22,049
- Yeah.
- You, uh...

315
00:14:22,181 --> 00:14:23,349
Dennis: Mike? Mike!

316
00:14:23,482 --> 00:14:24,817
Yo, hey, Mike.

317
00:14:24,951 --> 00:14:26,786
Mikey, how you doing?
I just got your email.

318
00:14:26,987 --> 00:14:29,622
Something with my modem.
I have to keep rebooting it.

319
00:14:29,755 --> 00:14:31,424
You know how these freaking
cable companies are.

320
00:14:31,624 --> 00:14:33,559
Yeah, it's Dennis, man, Dennis.
How you doing?

321
00:14:33,693 --> 00:14:35,361
You must have been
on the way when I sent back.

322
00:14:35,494 --> 00:14:37,164
What about the car?
Where is she taking the car?

323
00:14:37,296 --> 00:14:38,832
Dennis: I just sold that one.

324
00:14:39,198 --> 00:14:40,633
Signed, sealed, delivered.

325
00:14:40,766 --> 00:14:42,401
But I got three more cars out
here for you to see.

326
00:14:42,535 --> 00:14:43,669
You're absolutely gonna love
'em.

327
00:14:43,803 --> 00:14:44,770
(meows)

328
00:14:44,905 --> 00:14:46,272
Come on in,
make yourself at home.

329
00:14:46,405 --> 00:14:47,640
Look out for the cats.

330
00:14:47,773 --> 00:14:49,275
They're everywhere,
but they're fine.

331
00:14:49,408 --> 00:14:51,144
You want a beer or something?

332
00:14:51,277 --> 00:14:53,080
I'm fine. Thanks, though.

333
00:14:53,212 --> 00:14:55,281
Dennis: How 'bout a burrito?
Dude, they're great with mustard.

334
00:14:55,414 --> 00:14:57,316
Some homeless turned me on to them one day.
He's out front eating it,

335
00:14:57,450 --> 00:14:58,885
and I said,
"Hey, what are you eating?"

336
00:14:59,019 --> 00:15:00,453
He says, "A burrito.
It's really good with mustard.

337
00:15:00,586 --> 00:15:01,754
You want a bite?"

338
00:15:02,122 --> 00:15:03,622
I said, "Well, what the hell,
I'm adventurous."

339
00:15:03,756 --> 00:15:05,125
I tried it, I went in
and bought a dozen.

340
00:15:05,257 --> 00:15:06,927
I'm telling you,
they're fantastic.

341
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:09,361
Like the chicken myself.
They're awesome, man.

342
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:10,997
So, uh...

343
00:15:12,298 --> 00:15:13,499
Mr. Dennis.

344
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:15,234
Dennis: Yo, what kid?
I got a bum ear.

345
00:15:15,634 --> 00:15:17,204
Just the car.
I just wanted to know...

346
00:15:17,603 --> 00:15:20,272
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I got two cars
outside you're absolutely gonna love.

347
00:15:20,406 --> 00:15:22,341
Fine automobiles,
right up your alley.

348
00:15:22,475 --> 00:15:23,776
Don't worry about it.

349
00:15:26,245 --> 00:15:27,580
Say, you looking for
a watch upgrade?

350
00:15:27,813 --> 00:15:29,482
- Uh...
- They're really good man.

351
00:15:29,615 --> 00:15:31,218
Chinese construction,
Swiss movement.

352
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:32,919
- I'm good, I'm good.
- How 'bout a necklace? 28 karat gold.

353
00:15:33,053 --> 00:15:34,353
Show your old lady
how much you love her.

354
00:15:34,487 --> 00:15:35,889
Uh... Thanks, but no thanks.

355
00:15:36,022 --> 00:15:37,823
Watch out. Your feet.

356
00:15:38,024 --> 00:15:40,559
It's got a bad motivator.
Kinda got a mind of its own now.

357
00:15:40,693 --> 00:15:42,963
It wound up in the backyard
last week.

358
00:15:47,934 --> 00:15:50,736
Hey, uh, Dennis...
Hey, thanks for everything,

359
00:15:50,871 --> 00:15:53,173
but I really...
I gotta get going.

360
00:15:53,572 --> 00:15:54,841
Whoa, whoa, whoa, kid.
Don't worry.

361
00:15:54,975 --> 00:15:56,442
I got a car out here you're
gonna love.

362
00:15:56,675 --> 00:15:58,677
Come on, come on.
Let me show it to you, let's go.

363
00:16:01,248 --> 00:16:04,650
No finer car out here.
2,995.

364
00:16:07,254 --> 00:16:08,487
Um...

365
00:16:09,288 --> 00:16:11,091
Thanks and all.

366
00:16:11,224 --> 00:16:13,359
Whoa, whoa, whoa. You can't go
anywhere without test driving it.

367
00:16:13,692 --> 00:16:15,962
Come on, kid, we'll take it for
a little spin.

368
00:16:19,532 --> 00:16:21,767
(engine splutters)

369
00:16:21,902 --> 00:16:23,036
(engine revs)

370
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:24,503
She's just warming up.

371
00:16:25,404 --> 00:16:27,274
She's calling your name, Mike.
Come on.

372
00:16:27,406 --> 00:16:29,809
Come on, don't be shy.
Have a look.

373
00:16:30,877 --> 00:16:32,812
Come on in, kid.
Come on, come on.

374
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:35,081
What the fuck is this?

375
00:16:40,519 --> 00:16:42,055
Go on, put your foot in it.

376
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:44,557
- (engine revs)
- Feel that?

377
00:16:44,723 --> 00:16:47,593
That's 440 cubic inches under
your right foot, baby.

378
00:16:47,726 --> 00:16:48,862
She's got power to spare.

379
00:16:48,995 --> 00:16:50,663
This thing runs
like a scalded dog.

380
00:16:51,097 --> 00:16:54,767
Two-and-half tons of fine
American steel surrounding ya.

381
00:16:54,901 --> 00:16:57,536
Who needs airbags when you got
that kind of security?

382
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:59,172
This is when they made 'em
solid and stout.

383
00:16:59,306 --> 00:17:01,707
Baby, you hit something in this,
you don't need an airbag,

384
00:17:01,842 --> 00:17:03,475
because they're gonna know it,
you're not.

385
00:17:03,609 --> 00:17:04,643
You're gonna keep
flying down the road.

386
00:17:04,777 --> 00:17:06,279
And I know what you're thinking.

387
00:17:06,412 --> 00:17:08,414
The paints kinda faded
and the chromes not so bright,

388
00:17:08,547 --> 00:17:10,016
but you don't want to
blind people,

389
00:17:10,416 --> 00:17:12,685
you want to catch their eye.
You want to keep 'em glued to it.

390
00:17:12,818 --> 00:17:15,788
This car right here will do it
and the room.

391
00:17:15,989 --> 00:17:17,090
Can you feel it?

392
00:17:17,224 --> 00:17:19,226
It's like the great outdoors
with leather.

393
00:17:19,491 --> 00:17:20,961
This is Mikey's world
right here.

394
00:17:21,094 --> 00:17:24,563
This is your universe
on four tires, baby.

395
00:17:24,697 --> 00:17:27,399
Speaking of universe, look way out
there in the end of the galaxy.

396
00:17:27,533 --> 00:17:31,171
You're not gonna find more room in a
backseat, if you know what I mean, right?

397
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:34,040
I got collectors
from here to Missouri

398
00:17:34,174 --> 00:17:37,978
kicking down my door, begging me
to sell 'em this car.

399
00:17:38,912 --> 00:17:39,913
Is...

400
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,147
What do you say?

401
00:17:41,281 --> 00:17:42,781
...that an eight-track player?

402
00:17:42,949 --> 00:17:46,152
What? Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah, you got a good eye kid.

403
00:17:46,286 --> 00:17:47,954
Yeah, this the latest and
greatest in high fidelity.

404
00:17:48,088 --> 00:17:50,623
It's like the vinyl
of car audio.

405
00:17:50,756 --> 00:17:53,626
You know, as a matter of fact...

406
00:17:53,759 --> 00:17:57,063
(laughs)
I'll even throw in some tapes.

407
00:17:58,198 --> 00:18:01,500
(mellow guitar music plays)

408
00:18:29,528 --> 00:18:30,897
(brakes screech)

409
00:18:40,073 --> 00:18:42,708
(tape warbling)

410
00:18:45,045 --> 00:18:45,946
Hey!

411
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:51,985
(siren wails)

412
00:19:28,254 --> 00:19:31,091
My condolences.
You doing all right, hon?

413
00:19:31,358 --> 00:19:33,259
Um... Yeah. Why?

414
00:19:33,692 --> 00:19:34,928
Well clearly your grandpa
just died

415
00:19:35,095 --> 00:19:38,497
and he left you this very sturdy
automobile here.

416
00:19:40,066 --> 00:19:41,167
Mike: Um...

417
00:19:41,301 --> 00:19:43,003
Or is that not how you came to
be in possession

418
00:19:43,136 --> 00:19:45,472
- of this car, young man?
- No, no, I just bought it.

419
00:19:45,604 --> 00:19:47,073
I just got it.

420
00:19:47,474 --> 00:19:48,741
Male police officer: Funny.

421
00:19:50,276 --> 00:19:51,878
Thought a kid like him
would get himself

422
00:19:52,012 --> 00:19:56,850
some sort of... neon green
piece of shit sedan...

423
00:19:58,351 --> 00:19:59,718
with spinning rims.

424
00:20:00,719 --> 00:20:02,889
But voluntarily purchasing
himself...

425
00:20:03,655 --> 00:20:05,258
- What is this?
- Chrysler, New Yorker.

426
00:20:05,392 --> 00:20:09,295
A Chrysler New Yorker
that got crapped out by 1966.

427
00:20:09,429 --> 00:20:11,231
Mm. It is a '65.

428
00:20:12,165 --> 00:20:13,933
A 1965.

429
00:20:16,202 --> 00:20:18,972
That just don't sound like sober
decision making to me, Davis.

430
00:20:19,105 --> 00:20:20,473
We been doing
any drinking today?

431
00:20:20,606 --> 00:20:22,008
Uh... No, nope.

432
00:20:22,674 --> 00:20:24,244
- (clears throat)
- Any drug use?

433
00:20:24,377 --> 00:20:25,278
No.

434
00:20:26,046 --> 00:20:28,214
Marijuana?
Because that does qualify.

435
00:20:28,348 --> 00:20:30,083
I don't... I don't smoke.

436
00:20:30,884 --> 00:20:32,452
Texting while driving.

437
00:20:32,584 --> 00:20:33,819
No, see, I was just trying to...

438
00:20:33,953 --> 00:20:36,189
Let me just take a look at your
phone, please.

439
00:20:36,822 --> 00:20:38,124
Thank you.

440
00:20:42,829 --> 00:20:44,330
We're also gonna need license,
registration,

441
00:20:44,464 --> 00:20:46,399
- and proof of insurance.
- Yeah. Um...

442
00:20:46,533 --> 00:20:49,335
6:42 p.m., looks like
Brett sent you a sext.

443
00:20:49,469 --> 00:20:50,736
Yeah...

444
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:58,811
Registration, too.

445
00:20:59,479 --> 00:21:00,980
And proof of insurance.

446
00:21:01,414 --> 00:21:02,415
Oh yeah, I don't have it yet.

447
00:21:02,549 --> 00:21:04,484
I just... I just bought the car.

448
00:21:04,616 --> 00:21:07,187
But there is a registration card
in this vehicle, right?

449
00:21:07,653 --> 00:21:09,721
Registered by the previous
owner.

450
00:21:09,889 --> 00:21:11,424
- (phone vibrates)
- Who is Kelsey?

451
00:21:11,558 --> 00:21:14,828
Oh, um, Kelsey she's just
probably wondering where I am,

452
00:21:14,961 --> 00:21:17,530
'cause... (whispers)
...we have a date.

453
00:21:17,663 --> 00:21:19,365
- Sorry?
- Just taking her out on a date.

454
00:21:19,499 --> 00:21:21,868
- Oh, here you go.
- Don't let him answer that.

455
00:21:22,001 --> 00:21:23,269
(vibrating continues)

456
00:21:30,276 --> 00:21:32,011
Mr. Duchovny, sir.

457
00:21:36,715 --> 00:21:38,284
- Kelsey: <i>Hey.</i>
- Hey.

458
00:21:38,418 --> 00:21:40,053
There's a thing called a GPS
now. Have you tried it before?

459
00:21:40,186 --> 00:21:42,355
Just, uh,
gotta run a few errands.

460
00:21:42,489 --> 00:21:45,525
I'll be there around eight,
if that's cool?

461
00:21:45,657 --> 00:21:47,026
Yeah, no problem.

462
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,095
- I'll see you then.
- Kelsey: <i>You better.</i>

463
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,934
Duchovny: <i>So, um...</i>

464
00:21:55,935 --> 00:21:59,339
Your running errands
on date night, huh?

465
00:22:04,643 --> 00:22:05,912
Uh-huh.

466
00:22:06,045 --> 00:22:08,780
- I gotta go get some, uh...
- Condoms.

467
00:22:09,715 --> 00:22:11,084
Yeah.

468
00:22:11,985 --> 00:22:13,853
- Yeah.
- Good boy.

469
00:22:16,822 --> 00:22:18,191
(engine starts)

470
00:22:19,993 --> 00:22:21,727
(siren wails)

471
00:22:23,463 --> 00:22:24,796
Great.

472
00:22:26,533 --> 00:22:29,269
(car approaches)

473
00:22:36,009 --> 00:22:38,344
Mike: Hey, uh, Dennis, I, um...

474
00:22:38,845 --> 00:22:40,113
This stuff was in the car.

475
00:22:40,246 --> 00:22:42,115
I think you left it
in the glove box.

476
00:22:43,116 --> 00:22:44,017
Dennis?

477
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:06,005
Uh... Dennis?

478
00:23:10,543 --> 00:23:12,045
Hey, Dennis?

479
00:23:18,117 --> 00:23:18,817
Mm.

480
00:23:19,485 --> 00:23:22,322
This is not what it looks like
at all.

481
00:23:22,455 --> 00:23:23,623
Dennis.

482
00:23:23,822 --> 00:23:24,958
I bought a car from here,
from Dennis

483
00:23:25,258 --> 00:23:26,758
and I found this in
the glove compartment,

484
00:23:26,893 --> 00:23:27,961
I just wanted to return it.

485
00:23:28,094 --> 00:23:29,696
- Hey!
- (gunshot)

486
00:23:29,829 --> 00:23:32,065
- No, please!
- (gunshot)

487
00:23:32,198 --> 00:23:34,167
- Damn, lady. I'm sorry.
- (cat shrieks)

488
00:23:35,902 --> 00:23:37,003
Woman: Where's my husband?

489
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:40,173
- I didn't...
- (gunshots)

490
00:23:46,412 --> 00:23:47,813
(gunshot)

491
00:23:58,191 --> 00:24:00,293
Come on.
Just get it together.

492
00:24:03,363 --> 00:24:04,364
Shut up.

493
00:24:06,065 --> 00:24:08,735
Just gotta get it...
Just pull it.

494
00:24:08,868 --> 00:24:11,371
(muttering)

495
00:24:13,406 --> 00:24:14,540
(gasps)

496
00:24:28,855 --> 00:24:30,123
I'm gonna shoot you anyway,

497
00:24:30,523 --> 00:24:32,824
so you might as well just come
out and get it over with.

498
00:24:39,132 --> 00:24:41,167
Where's my husband?

499
00:24:41,301 --> 00:24:42,201
(gunshots)

500
00:24:42,335 --> 00:24:47,073
- Where is he?
- (gunfire)

501
00:24:51,344 --> 00:24:52,245
Hey!

502
00:24:56,049 --> 00:24:59,285
- Mike: Oh, God.
- Hey! Get back here!

503
00:25:00,386 --> 00:25:01,521
Mike: Whoa!

504
00:25:04,324 --> 00:25:06,059
(screams)

505
00:25:11,731 --> 00:25:14,467
(siren wails)

506
00:25:16,035 --> 00:25:18,404
Davis: All right,
let's just back up here.

507
00:25:18,538 --> 00:25:21,140
The vacuum cleaner got out on
the sidewalk how?

508
00:25:21,274 --> 00:25:23,276
Um... I don't know.

509
00:25:23,409 --> 00:25:25,578
- (indistinct chatter)
- Woman: I don't want your help.

510
00:25:25,712 --> 00:25:26,913
I don't want your help!

511
00:25:27,347 --> 00:25:30,283
Just get out of my house!
Just get out of my house!

512
00:25:30,416 --> 00:25:31,584
Just get out!

513
00:25:32,118 --> 00:25:33,386
(sobs) Get out.

514
00:25:34,887 --> 00:25:36,022
I'm not a criminal.

515
00:25:36,155 --> 00:25:37,724
What did I do?
I didn't do anything.

516
00:25:37,857 --> 00:25:39,158
Oh, yeah?

517
00:25:41,627 --> 00:25:43,463
(phone vibrates)

518
00:25:43,596 --> 00:25:45,131
Don't answer that.

519
00:25:53,906 --> 00:25:55,274
Woman: Kelsey!

520
00:25:55,408 --> 00:25:56,442
Dinner.

521
00:25:57,643 --> 00:25:58,611
(door slams)

522
00:26:02,181 --> 00:26:03,916
Chet: Yo, Kelsey.

523
00:26:04,050 --> 00:26:05,618
Shouldn't you be studying it up?

524
00:26:06,686 --> 00:26:10,490
Woman: Kelsey, are you eating
or going out?

525
00:26:11,591 --> 00:26:12,959
(door slams)

526
00:26:17,029 --> 00:26:18,531
Davis: Michael,
thanks for calling us in

527
00:26:18,664 --> 00:26:21,334
about knock on the noggin,
we really appreciate it,

528
00:26:21,467 --> 00:26:23,069
but I can't help but wonder

529
00:26:23,202 --> 00:26:26,005
why were you even here
in the first place?

530
00:26:26,139 --> 00:26:27,940
I bought a car from Dennis.

531
00:26:28,074 --> 00:26:30,676
Here's the paperwork right here,
actually. My...

532
00:26:30,810 --> 00:26:33,513
You were meant to be out
romancing with Kelsey, right?

533
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,381
I...

534
00:26:37,183 --> 00:26:41,354
I left my watch
and actually speaking of time,

535
00:26:41,487 --> 00:26:43,656
- I do have to get going...
- If you don't take off your watch

536
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:45,958
and leave it at a complete
stranger's house,

537
00:26:46,092 --> 00:26:48,327
you wouldn't be late.
Right?

538
00:26:48,461 --> 00:26:50,062
I don't know how true that is.

539
00:26:50,196 --> 00:26:51,964
Seeing as he hasn't taken off
his watch in two years

540
00:26:52,098 --> 00:26:53,499
and he's still late.

541
00:26:55,201 --> 00:26:57,270
I told you
I'd make it up to you.

542
00:26:58,037 --> 00:26:59,372
Oh, yes, you will.

543
00:27:01,307 --> 00:27:03,409
Who cares
about a freaking watch?

544
00:27:03,543 --> 00:27:06,646
I want to know who went
to my house and took my husband?

545
00:27:06,779 --> 00:27:08,581
David: Honey, we want those
answers the same as you

546
00:27:08,714 --> 00:27:10,650
but we gotta come at this from
every angle, right?

547
00:27:10,783 --> 00:27:13,854
'Cause your husband has got
himself a record,

548
00:27:13,986 --> 00:27:15,221
and you know that.

549
00:27:16,022 --> 00:27:20,293
Michael, let's talk turkey.
Got ourselves a missing person.

550
00:27:20,894 --> 00:27:22,028
Got a burglary.

551
00:27:22,628 --> 00:27:24,764
And we got you...
here at the scene.

552
00:27:24,898 --> 00:27:26,999
I didn't, I didn't take
anything. I swear, I didn't.

553
00:27:27,133 --> 00:27:28,501
You can check my car.

554
00:27:28,634 --> 00:27:31,737
Okay, did you see anything
of any value in here

555
00:27:31,872 --> 00:27:34,173
that maybe someone else would of
broken in for?

556
00:27:36,809 --> 00:27:38,010
Anything.

557
00:27:39,947 --> 00:27:42,248
Nothing out of the ordinary, no.

558
00:27:42,381 --> 00:27:43,349
No?

559
00:27:45,618 --> 00:27:46,619
Okay.

560
00:27:46,752 --> 00:27:48,588
Mike:
Is it okay if I leave though?

561
00:27:48,721 --> 00:27:50,690
Yes, you're late.

562
00:27:50,823 --> 00:27:52,492
- Michael.
- Yes?

563
00:27:52,625 --> 00:27:54,427
Davis:
You might want your phone.

564
00:27:54,994 --> 00:27:56,195
Thank you.

565
00:27:58,531 --> 00:28:01,467
Don't worry about it.
Go on, get out of here.

566
00:28:02,068 --> 00:28:03,603
Would you get that?

567
00:28:15,281 --> 00:28:17,683
(engine spluttering)

568
00:28:20,453 --> 00:28:21,787
Duchovny: So, Darla.

569
00:28:23,289 --> 00:28:24,790
How do you know Tony?

570
00:28:34,667 --> 00:28:37,436
- Kelsey: Missed a spot.
- Oh. (chuckles)

571
00:28:39,605 --> 00:28:41,774
So, uh, you change your mind on
that study sesh?

572
00:28:41,909 --> 00:28:43,576
Nope, taking out the trash.

573
00:28:45,946 --> 00:28:47,981
Go on, that's your cue.

574
00:28:48,114 --> 00:28:49,382
What?

575
00:28:51,985 --> 00:28:53,119
(chuckles)

576
00:28:53,553 --> 00:28:55,655
I got it.
That's funny.

577
00:28:55,788 --> 00:28:58,424
Kelsey: I'm good for a joke.
Not much else.

578
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:03,329
- Something wrong?
- No, fine.

579
00:29:04,196 --> 00:29:05,698
You seem a little down.

580
00:29:06,198 --> 00:29:07,300
Do I?

581
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:13,806
You know if you ever need
to get anything off your chest,

582
00:29:13,941 --> 00:29:15,008
I'm your guy, right?

583
00:29:15,909 --> 00:29:18,077
Something that I actually
really love.

584
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:20,279
You know,
being the sympathetic ear

585
00:29:20,413 --> 00:29:21,514
for those who need it.

586
00:29:21,647 --> 00:29:23,850
That must be a really hard life.

587
00:29:23,984 --> 00:29:27,553
Being permanently attached to
the side of somebody's head.

588
00:29:27,687 --> 00:29:29,155
I mean, how do you deal
with the earwax?

589
00:29:29,422 --> 00:29:31,892
Do you, like, penetrate yourself
with a really big Q-tip?

590
00:29:32,025 --> 00:29:34,393
Are you seriously judging me
based on my appearance?

591
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:37,965
Why can't a good looking,
tri sport athlete

592
00:29:38,097 --> 00:29:41,267
love being the person who
shows up for a friend

593
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,735
when they need it?

594
00:29:54,014 --> 00:29:55,314
All right, Chet.

595
00:29:57,416 --> 00:29:58,718
Let's go for a ride.

596
00:30:00,686 --> 00:30:03,356
Or should I leave you two alone?

597
00:30:03,489 --> 00:30:05,725
(tires screeching)

598
00:30:20,706 --> 00:30:22,042
(tires screech)

599
00:30:22,174 --> 00:30:24,543
(pants)

600
00:30:25,745 --> 00:30:27,480
(phone vibrates)

601
00:30:27,613 --> 00:30:30,683
Mike, money, check it out.

602
00:30:31,183 --> 00:30:32,518
It's a secret.

603
00:30:33,954 --> 00:30:36,756
(scoffs) No, we're not joining.
Don't get the pamphlets.

604
00:30:36,890 --> 00:30:39,625
Mike: Mrs. Madison,
I'm here to pick up Kelsey.

605
00:30:41,327 --> 00:30:42,595
Oh.

606
00:30:42,795 --> 00:30:43,763
I see.

607
00:30:43,997 --> 00:30:45,398
So you're the asshole
that stood her up?

608
00:30:45,631 --> 00:30:46,499
Look...

609
00:30:46,632 --> 00:30:48,534
- Earl.
- Yeah, yeah.

610
00:30:48,668 --> 00:30:50,636
- Look who's here.
- What's up, dear? What?

611
00:30:50,937 --> 00:30:53,907
- Look who's here.
- Earl: Yeah, what do you want?

612
00:30:54,107 --> 00:30:55,441
Mike: Just looking for...

613
00:30:55,574 --> 00:30:57,077
Come on, spit it out, kid.
What do you want?

614
00:30:57,209 --> 00:30:59,445
I'm really sorry I'm late,
but I ran into an emergency,

615
00:30:59,578 --> 00:31:02,581
and I promise
I can make it up to her.

616
00:31:02,715 --> 00:31:04,350
Yeah, yeah.
What? Make it up to her?

617
00:31:04,517 --> 00:31:05,852
What does that mean?

618
00:31:06,719 --> 00:31:07,787
(gulps)

619
00:31:08,487 --> 00:31:11,424
I... I just wanted to talk her.
Is it okay if I talk to her right now?

620
00:31:11,557 --> 00:31:12,959
- Like really quickly.
- No.

621
00:31:13,693 --> 00:31:16,295
She left with that neighbor kid.

622
00:31:18,564 --> 00:31:20,167
Is that your heap
on the driveway?

623
00:31:20,299 --> 00:31:25,438
Oh look at that piece of...
Wait, is that a '61 Impala?

624
00:31:25,571 --> 00:31:26,973
What a piece of crap.

625
00:31:27,107 --> 00:31:28,541
No, wait.

626
00:31:36,917 --> 00:31:39,285
Ricky: <i>Okay, so he shoots Lenny
and then the story ends.</i>

627
00:31:40,352 --> 00:31:42,856
<i>Since we're just sitting
around here waiting for shit.</i>

628
00:31:42,989 --> 00:31:44,891
<i>Might as well talk about
why he does that.</i>

629
00:31:45,192 --> 00:31:47,626
- Vince: <i>What are you looking at me for?</i>
- Ricky: <i>You know why.</i>

630
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,663
- Vince: <i>Shut the fuck up!</i>
- Ricky: <i>Let's talk about the fucking books...</i>

631
00:31:51,064 --> 00:31:52,765
<i>Titanic</i> on VHS.

632
00:31:52,899 --> 00:31:56,268
(indistinct chatter)

633
00:31:56,402 --> 00:31:57,570
It's got two tapes.

634
00:31:58,171 --> 00:32:00,639
Vince: <i>I don't want you
to think that...</i>

635
00:32:01,307 --> 00:32:03,076
Wonder where the VCR is.

636
00:32:03,409 --> 00:32:05,377
Vince: That's what they do. The put a
fucking bullet in the back of the head.

637
00:32:05,511 --> 00:32:07,480
Ricky: So what, he's too lazy to
take care of a sick pet?

638
00:32:07,613 --> 00:32:08,849
What?
Is that what you're saying?

639
00:32:08,982 --> 00:32:10,449
Vince: No, no. This has
nothing to do with that.

640
00:32:10,583 --> 00:32:12,585
Ricky: Yes, it does.
Yes it fucking does.

641
00:32:12,718 --> 00:32:13,987
All right,
George was too afraid.

642
00:32:14,121 --> 00:32:15,755
He was too afraid to take care
of Lenny.

643
00:32:15,889 --> 00:32:17,590
He's too afraid
to fucking man up,

644
00:32:17,723 --> 00:32:20,326
put some hair on his fucking
chest, and take the fall.

645
00:32:20,459 --> 00:32:21,928
He takes the easy way out.

646
00:32:22,062 --> 00:32:23,462
Vince: That is not true!

647
00:32:23,596 --> 00:32:25,132
Ricky: Yes, it is.
It's right there in the book.

648
00:32:25,264 --> 00:32:27,433
- He's fucking selfish.
- Vince: It was a mercy killing.

649
00:32:27,566 --> 00:32:28,902
Ricky: It wasn't
a fucking mercy killing.

650
00:32:29,035 --> 00:32:30,603
George was covering
for his fucking self.

651
00:32:30,736 --> 00:32:31,938
Vince: Covering for himself
for what?

652
00:32:32,072 --> 00:32:33,439
In what world
did he commit a crime?

653
00:32:33,572 --> 00:32:35,108
Oh, my God,
did you miss the part

654
00:32:35,242 --> 00:32:37,443
where George does nothing while
Lenny murders Curley's wife?

655
00:32:37,576 --> 00:32:39,345
It wasn't murder.
He's an idiot.

656
00:32:39,478 --> 00:32:42,115
- How is he responsible...
- He's actually mentally disabled.

657
00:32:42,249 --> 00:32:45,018
- Shut up!
- See, even he gets it. Asshole.

658
00:32:45,152 --> 00:32:46,920
What the fuck?
Is this the fucking PC police?

659
00:32:47,053 --> 00:32:49,189
You know if your one job
is to keep an eye one someone

660
00:32:49,321 --> 00:32:51,323
that's not all there, then you lock
that shit down. You don't fuck around

661
00:32:51,457 --> 00:32:53,526
- with that shit.
- What do you know about caring about anybody?

662
00:32:53,659 --> 00:32:56,263
Oh, you've no fucking idea and an
idiot is totally fucking different.

663
00:32:56,395 --> 00:32:57,563
Vince: How so, Ricky?

664
00:32:57,696 --> 00:32:59,698
Textbook example.
(laughs)

665
00:32:59,833 --> 00:33:01,300
Hey, Ricky, you wanna watch
<i>Titanic?</i>

666
00:33:01,433 --> 00:33:03,036
Shut up.
You know, Vince,

667
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:05,738
you've got zero awareness
of how you effect other people,

668
00:33:05,872 --> 00:33:07,473
- you know that?
- It's a romance.

669
00:33:07,706 --> 00:33:09,843
Ricky: With your fucking words,
with your fucking actions.

670
00:33:09,976 --> 00:33:11,811
You just fly in like a big
fucking wrecking ball

671
00:33:11,945 --> 00:33:13,847
and you smash up
everybody's shit

672
00:33:14,014 --> 00:33:16,216
with no fucking regard.
And you know, I'm getting sick and tired

673
00:33:16,348 --> 00:33:18,818
- of having to hold you accountable...
- Donnie!

674
00:33:18,952 --> 00:33:21,687
Why the fuck are your feet on
the coffee table?

675
00:33:26,725 --> 00:33:28,594
No, you don't come into
somebody's home

676
00:33:28,727 --> 00:33:32,398
and disrespect the home by putting
your fucking feet on the coffee table.

677
00:33:32,531 --> 00:33:35,668
- You literally broke into this house.
- It's common courtesy 101.

678
00:33:35,801 --> 00:33:37,636
That is where people eat.

679
00:33:37,770 --> 00:33:39,039
People don't eat
on coffee tables.

680
00:33:39,172 --> 00:33:41,574
But people don't eat off it.
They just...

681
00:33:41,707 --> 00:33:44,211
Do you like the taste of your
own shit in your coffee?

682
00:33:44,677 --> 00:33:46,779
- You don't even drink coffee.
- Huh?

683
00:33:48,849 --> 00:33:49,850
No.

684
00:33:49,983 --> 00:33:51,684
When I pull my foot
out of your ass,

685
00:33:51,817 --> 00:33:54,287
I'm gonna wipe my shoe all over
the fucking coffee table,

686
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:56,156
then you can taste
all the bullshit,

687
00:33:56,289 --> 00:33:58,024
shitty-ass, fucked up coffee
that you want

688
00:33:58,158 --> 00:34:00,492
and stop sucking face in front
of everybody,

689
00:34:00,626 --> 00:34:02,095
it's fucking disgusting!

690
00:34:02,229 --> 00:34:03,964
Get involved in this
goddamn book club,

691
00:34:04,097 --> 00:34:07,267
or I'm gonna fucking start
killing people, God damn it!

692
00:34:07,399 --> 00:34:09,102
Man: Do I have to start
smoking inside?

693
00:34:15,842 --> 00:34:16,775
Huh?

694
00:34:17,476 --> 00:34:20,881
'Cause every time I step
outside, for my smoke break,

695
00:34:21,814 --> 00:34:24,951
you know, as an act
of courtesy to you all,

696
00:34:25,784 --> 00:34:29,655
when I come back in, everything
has gone to shit.

697
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:33,126
So, maybe, I need to make you

698
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:37,063
start inhaling my fucking
second-hand smoke.

699
00:34:37,663 --> 00:34:39,632
You make them inhale your
second-hand smoke, huh?

700
00:34:39,765 --> 00:34:43,003
Just for the 2,000th
fucking time...

701
00:34:44,603 --> 00:34:47,941
just... tolerate each other

702
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:51,477
and then you can all go home,

703
00:34:51,610 --> 00:34:55,781
and... we never have to
see each other again.

704
00:34:59,418 --> 00:35:00,887
Man: What about book club?

705
00:35:08,194 --> 00:35:09,095
Please.

706
00:35:12,165 --> 00:35:13,066
Please.

707
00:35:15,734 --> 00:35:17,436
Help me out here.

708
00:35:21,975 --> 00:35:24,810
So we can stop playing fucking
Brady Bunch.

709
00:35:26,712 --> 00:35:29,515
(muffled speech)

710
00:35:30,016 --> 00:35:32,953
(screams) Fucking Christ man!

711
00:35:33,219 --> 00:35:36,389
Fuck, what do you do for an
encore, a fucking Brazilian?

712
00:35:36,522 --> 00:35:37,790
What the fuck?

713
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:40,393
Look, what time is it?

714
00:35:40,526 --> 00:35:42,062
Anybody, ten o'clock?

715
00:35:42,195 --> 00:35:44,730
Roughly ten o'clock, right?
Ten o'clock on a Saturday night.

716
00:35:44,864 --> 00:35:47,167
Where else do you think a kid
with a new car would be?

717
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:50,904
Out on a cruise, joyriding.
That's what these kids do.

718
00:35:51,037 --> 00:35:53,306
That's what those cars are
designed for.

719
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:58,477
Joyrides, it be fucking criminal if he was
doing anything else, man. No pun intended.

720
00:35:58,610 --> 00:36:00,914
That's what fucking concerns me.

721
00:36:01,047 --> 00:36:03,049
- Dennis, right?
- Yeah, yeah.

722
00:36:03,183 --> 00:36:06,685
'Cause Tony,
he was out on a joyride, too.

723
00:36:06,819 --> 00:36:08,088
- Right?
- Okay.

724
00:36:08,388 --> 00:36:12,758
In that same exact fucking car
that you let him borrow.

725
00:36:12,892 --> 00:36:14,160
Remember what happened to Tony?

726
00:36:14,294 --> 00:36:15,929
I didn't know all the shit
he was in to.

727
00:36:16,062 --> 00:36:17,931
He wanted to borrow a car, fine.
It's a shit box, man.

728
00:36:18,198 --> 00:36:22,002
It's worth 200 bucks. Think about it.
Just think about it.

729
00:36:23,136 --> 00:36:26,339
If I'd have known what the fuck
Tony was up to,

730
00:36:26,473 --> 00:36:27,941
you think for one fucking second

731
00:36:28,074 --> 00:36:30,276
I would have sold that kid,
Mikey, the fucking car?

732
00:36:31,610 --> 00:36:32,946
No, no, man.

733
00:36:33,079 --> 00:36:35,315
It doesn't take a genius to
figure that out.

734
00:36:35,448 --> 00:36:37,150
(scoffs) For fuck's sake, man.

735
00:36:37,283 --> 00:36:39,085
I could be a sailor,
I could be a priest.

736
00:36:39,219 --> 00:36:41,087
I could swear to you seven
different ways

737
00:36:41,221 --> 00:36:44,024
to fucking doomsday,
but I swear to ya,

738
00:36:44,157 --> 00:36:45,859
I don't know shit.

739
00:37:02,175 --> 00:37:03,209
(burps)

740
00:37:03,343 --> 00:37:04,676
(clears throat)

741
00:37:08,547 --> 00:37:09,916
You don't know anything?

742
00:37:11,151 --> 00:37:12,318
No.

743
00:37:13,486 --> 00:37:14,521
Okay.

744
00:37:15,055 --> 00:37:18,557
Well, let me tell you
what I know.

745
00:37:21,961 --> 00:37:27,699
I know that... that five star
beach side resort

746
00:37:27,834 --> 00:37:30,636
in the sky
that Tony checked into,

747
00:37:31,471 --> 00:37:33,106
I know that they're always

748
00:37:33,306 --> 00:37:35,774
accepting new clientele,
you know?

749
00:37:37,010 --> 00:37:40,947
You know there's always a...
vacancy open there...

750
00:37:42,115 --> 00:37:44,683
and... Dennis...

751
00:37:45,751 --> 00:37:48,254
if that fucking car
does not show up...

752
00:37:52,992 --> 00:37:54,861
I'm gonna check myself in.

753
00:37:58,697 --> 00:38:00,033
But...

754
00:38:01,101 --> 00:38:02,634
you're gonna check in first.

755
00:38:02,768 --> 00:38:04,904
Come on, man,
what are you doing? I've got...

756
00:38:05,972 --> 00:38:09,109
Somebody give me
a goddamn drill.

757
00:38:16,748 --> 00:38:18,151
(horn honks)

758
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:25,691
(horn honks)

759
00:38:35,268 --> 00:38:36,668
(horn honks)

760
00:38:46,446 --> 00:38:47,779
(engine stops)

761
00:39:17,577 --> 00:39:21,780
(tense music plays)

762
00:39:34,627 --> 00:39:35,895
One second.

763
00:39:37,330 --> 00:39:39,132
Excuse me.
See I think...

764
00:39:39,265 --> 00:39:41,067
- We used to own this car.
- Right, yes, yes.

765
00:39:41,201 --> 00:39:42,535
We used to own this car,
I think.

766
00:39:42,669 --> 00:39:43,802
Hey, hang on.

767
00:39:44,604 --> 00:39:47,340
Yeah, it's still there.
It looks good, too.

768
00:39:47,473 --> 00:39:48,740
I redid the seat cover.

769
00:39:48,875 --> 00:39:50,443
The blood wouldn't come out.

770
00:39:51,678 --> 00:39:54,447
Oh, sorry.
This was 1982.

771
00:39:54,581 --> 00:39:56,349
We were out on the highway
in the middle of nowhere.

772
00:39:56,482 --> 00:39:59,018
No idea where I was,
the cops are hightailing after us.

773
00:39:59,152 --> 00:40:01,054
- I'm screaming like you wouldn't believe.
- Right, right.

774
00:40:01,187 --> 00:40:02,488
- And then my water broke.
- Right, right.

775
00:40:02,622 --> 00:40:04,224
- So, I gotta pull over.
- It's our first born.

776
00:40:04,357 --> 00:40:06,192
And the second I do,
there's cops everywhere.

777
00:40:06,326 --> 00:40:08,760
- They got their guns drawn.
- They think he's a kidnapper.

778
00:40:08,895 --> 00:40:10,263
They're hollering.

779
00:40:10,463 --> 00:40:12,031
- They're telling us all...
- I'm yelling, "Stop!

780
00:40:12,165 --> 00:40:13,933
Somebody's gotta grab this baby
coming out of me."

781
00:40:14,067 --> 00:40:16,002
So, I'm just like, "Sorry, Officer,
I gotta help my wife right now,

782
00:40:16,135 --> 00:40:17,803
- you can arrest me later."
- So at this point.

783
00:40:17,937 --> 00:40:19,172
I've gotta...
I've gotta stretch out.

784
00:40:19,305 --> 00:40:20,707
Right, good thing
it was a bench seat.

785
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:21,674
Woman: And I close my eyes
and push.

786
00:40:21,807 --> 00:40:23,209
And our little girl...

787
00:40:24,677 --> 00:40:27,213
she just falls out into my arms.

788
00:40:28,047 --> 00:40:29,182
(woman chuckles)

789
00:40:31,817 --> 00:40:35,121
And then the placenta pops out
of me and hits him in the face,

790
00:40:35,255 --> 00:40:38,524
and he falls backwards,
but he does not drop our baby.

791
00:40:38,658 --> 00:40:41,394
That's when I knew.
World's greatest dad.

792
00:40:41,527 --> 00:40:42,495
Oh.

793
00:40:43,396 --> 00:40:44,397
(woman sighs)

794
00:40:44,831 --> 00:40:45,932
Gosh.

795
00:40:46,866 --> 00:40:48,800
- Time flies.
- Man: Hm.

796
00:41:04,384 --> 00:41:07,520
Hey, this might be
a little strange,

797
00:41:07,654 --> 00:41:09,389
or, I don't know, rude,
but...

798
00:41:09,989 --> 00:41:12,191
Could we take the car out
for a drive?

799
00:41:12,791 --> 00:41:14,160
Oh, uh...

800
00:41:14,294 --> 00:41:15,628
Woman: Well, you could go
with us, of course.

801
00:41:15,762 --> 00:41:16,963
I... I... I...

802
00:41:17,096 --> 00:41:19,198
Yeah,
we wouldn't run off with her.

803
00:41:19,332 --> 00:41:20,933
We could pay you something.

804
00:41:21,067 --> 00:41:24,803
No, no that's okay.
I honestly should be getting...

805
00:41:24,937 --> 00:41:27,373
Three hundred.
What do you think?

806
00:41:27,507 --> 00:41:29,142
Three hundred,
is that good for, I don't know,

807
00:41:29,275 --> 00:41:30,977
20 minutes, half an hour?

808
00:41:31,944 --> 00:41:33,880
Well, we can pay you more
if you want?

809
00:41:34,013 --> 00:41:35,081
I don't know, a thousand?

810
00:41:35,214 --> 00:41:38,217
- What?
- That's okay, um...

811
00:41:39,085 --> 00:41:41,954
- It's... 300 is fine.
- (gasps)

812
00:41:42,655 --> 00:41:43,890
Thank you.

813
00:41:44,023 --> 00:41:46,025
That's more than 300.

814
00:41:49,929 --> 00:41:51,998
(engine splutters)

815
00:41:52,765 --> 00:41:55,468
(engine revs)

816
00:41:55,935 --> 00:41:56,903
(laughs)

817
00:41:57,036 --> 00:41:58,204
Let's go.

818
00:42:14,053 --> 00:42:16,089
Kinda cold,
do you want some heat?

819
00:42:19,726 --> 00:42:21,260
You remember that?

820
00:42:22,095 --> 00:42:24,163
- Man: How could I forget?
- (woman laughs)

821
00:42:27,066 --> 00:42:28,901
You wanna drive up there?

822
00:42:35,208 --> 00:42:36,342
There's the turn.

823
00:42:36,476 --> 00:42:39,145
(tires screech)

824
00:42:39,645 --> 00:42:42,248
(laughing)

825
00:42:42,382 --> 00:42:44,083
Um... Where are we going?

826
00:43:18,017 --> 00:43:19,652
Woman:
The town's really changed.

827
00:43:22,655 --> 00:43:23,923
I'll be darned.

828
00:43:27,827 --> 00:43:29,662
I've never been up here before.

829
00:43:30,930 --> 00:43:33,065
We came here on our first date.

830
00:43:44,076 --> 00:43:47,613
(woman moaning)

831
00:43:47,747 --> 00:43:49,415
Some things never change.

832
00:43:56,789 --> 00:43:59,559
(woman moaning)

833
00:44:08,134 --> 00:44:11,304
(moaning)

834
00:44:18,077 --> 00:44:19,545
Woman: Is that it?

835
00:44:20,213 --> 00:44:21,414
Man: I'm sorry baby.

836
00:44:21,547 --> 00:44:23,616
- Woman: Get off.
- Man: I'm sorry.

837
00:44:24,383 --> 00:44:26,419
Take care of myself later.

838
00:44:26,552 --> 00:44:28,321
(Donnie pants)

839
00:44:32,391 --> 00:44:33,459
Donnie.

840
00:44:36,028 --> 00:44:37,230
Donnie.

841
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:43,236
Is that that stupid car?

842
00:44:45,304 --> 00:44:48,508
(phone vibrates)

843
00:44:48,641 --> 00:44:49,943
- Donnie: <i>Bro.</i>
- What's up, Yoko Ono?

844
00:44:50,076 --> 00:44:51,677
Fucking up somebody else's shit?

845
00:44:51,811 --> 00:44:53,379
Calm down.

846
00:44:53,746 --> 00:44:55,248
Hey, when's the last time you
did something not named Mikaylah?

847
00:44:55,481 --> 00:44:58,818
Listen man, the kid,
his freaking car is right here,

848
00:44:58,952 --> 00:45:00,586
right in front of my eyes, bro.

849
00:45:01,053 --> 00:45:04,290
You know that spot,
that make out spot with the dope-ass view?

850
00:45:05,224 --> 00:45:06,759
I'm just gonna handle it
real quick.

851
00:45:06,894 --> 00:45:08,962
No, no, no you're not gonna
handle shit. Okay, brain trust?

852
00:45:09,095 --> 00:45:11,464
You remember the last time I had
you handle something?

853
00:45:11,999 --> 00:45:13,366
Do you remember Stanley?

854
00:45:13,533 --> 00:45:16,102
<i>My best friend in the whole
world, Stanley,</i>

855
00:45:16,235 --> 00:45:17,637
<i>do you remember that?</i>

856
00:45:18,437 --> 00:45:20,306
Hamsters are not aquatic, Lenny!

857
00:45:20,439 --> 00:45:21,374
What the fuck is happening?

858
00:45:21,507 --> 00:45:23,643
Donnie found the car.

859
00:45:24,644 --> 00:45:25,645
(Dennis sighs)

860
00:45:26,212 --> 00:45:27,580
Fucking go get it.

861
00:45:41,962 --> 00:45:43,229
(indistinct chatter)

862
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:49,168
(indistinct chatter)

863
00:45:52,305 --> 00:45:55,074
(soft music plays)

864
00:45:59,046 --> 00:46:00,413
(moaning)

865
00:46:01,014 --> 00:46:02,214
Um...

866
00:46:04,851 --> 00:46:06,085
(door opens)

867
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:10,189
(soft rock music plays)

868
00:46:31,577 --> 00:46:32,511
(sighs)

869
00:46:36,917 --> 00:46:38,250
Hi.

870
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:41,420
(moaning)

871
00:46:41,554 --> 00:46:43,189
Ricky: Fuck! Get off her!

872
00:46:43,322 --> 00:46:44,690
Vince: Jesus!

873
00:46:44,824 --> 00:46:45,725
Woman: What the fuck?

874
00:46:45,859 --> 00:46:49,161
(overlapping shouting)

875
00:46:49,295 --> 00:46:50,931
Man: Hey, let go of me!

876
00:46:51,697 --> 00:46:54,101
Sorry,
we're gonna have to kill you.

877
00:46:54,233 --> 00:46:55,267
You saw our faces.

878
00:46:55,401 --> 00:46:56,736
Shannon:
Should have wore a mask.

879
00:46:56,870 --> 00:46:58,337
Shannon, knock it off.

880
00:46:58,471 --> 00:47:00,539
Will both of you shut the fuck
up and get this done?

881
00:47:00,673 --> 00:47:02,042
Ricky: Will you stop yelling?

882
00:47:02,541 --> 00:47:03,977
I got somewhere to be and we all
got a fucking book to read.

883
00:47:04,111 --> 00:47:05,745
Yeah, well you can read it by
your own damn self,

884
00:47:05,879 --> 00:47:08,547
'cause after this jobs through,
I'm fucking quitting.

885
00:47:08,681 --> 00:47:10,182
You're quitting book club?

886
00:47:14,220 --> 00:47:15,721
Yeah, I'm quitting book club

887
00:47:15,856 --> 00:47:17,590
and being sucked into
one bone-head job

888
00:47:17,723 --> 00:47:20,259
after another and watching you
fuck 'em all up.

889
00:47:20,393 --> 00:47:21,862
- Real mature.
- Over and over again.

890
00:47:22,461 --> 00:47:24,664
- Real fucking mature.
- Ricky: I can set my watch to your fucking screw ups.

891
00:47:24,797 --> 00:47:26,465
What are we gonna do
without you?

892
00:47:26,599 --> 00:47:29,335
Anyone can do my job, dumb ass.

893
00:47:29,468 --> 00:47:30,937
No, they can't.

894
00:47:32,005 --> 00:47:34,473
You want to quit?
Then get the fuck out of here.

895
00:47:34,607 --> 00:47:38,210
I'll do your part. I'll shoot all three of
these motherfuckers and load them in the car.

896
00:47:38,344 --> 00:47:40,947
- You can't fucking shoot them. Of course you...
- Why are you still talking?

897
00:47:41,081 --> 00:47:42,748
You just said you're gonna
fucking quit.

898
00:47:42,883 --> 00:47:44,417
I don't quit
in the middle of shit.

899
00:47:44,550 --> 00:47:45,818
You literally just said
you're gonna quit.

900
00:47:45,952 --> 00:47:47,186
I said I'm quitting after.

901
00:47:48,021 --> 00:47:49,522
- And leave us to do all the fucking work.
- I fucking said I quit after,

902
00:47:49,655 --> 00:47:50,891
- you fucking asshole.
- Vince: What the fuck?

903
00:47:51,323 --> 00:47:52,993
- That's exactly what you said.
- Do you not understand me?

904
00:47:53,559 --> 00:47:55,795
Vince: Do you not hear the words that
are coming out of your fucking mouth?

905
00:47:55,929 --> 00:47:57,196
- Chill out, Vince.
- Where the fuck is Donnie? I need to hit someone.

906
00:47:57,329 --> 00:47:59,465
(screaming)

907
00:47:59,598 --> 00:48:01,134
- (yells)
- (grunts)

908
00:48:01,267 --> 00:48:02,936
(grunting)

909
00:48:03,070 --> 00:48:05,538
(screaming)

910
00:48:06,272 --> 00:48:07,807
Should we help them?

911
00:48:08,374 --> 00:48:09,508
Nope.

912
00:48:09,642 --> 00:48:11,343
It's not like I could help,
anyway.

913
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:19,052
Why are you just regurgitating those stupid
shit comments that Vince makes about you?

914
00:48:19,186 --> 00:48:20,887
I mean, what's Vince even doing?

915
00:48:21,021 --> 00:48:24,590
Sitting around on his ass,
talking about that lame-ass book.

916
00:48:24,724 --> 00:48:27,460
It's not even a book.
It's a novella.

917
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:29,896
(grunting)

918
00:48:30,030 --> 00:48:31,363
(gun cocks)

919
00:48:31,497 --> 00:48:32,966
Hey, hey, hey.

920
00:48:34,101 --> 00:48:35,334
Oh, fucking... Jeez!

921
00:48:35,468 --> 00:48:36,802
(gunshot)

922
00:48:36,937 --> 00:48:40,339
(dramatic music plays)

923
00:48:59,926 --> 00:49:02,394
(screaming)

924
00:49:02,528 --> 00:49:04,363
(indistinct shouting)

925
00:49:06,133 --> 00:49:07,767
Babe, you're a badass.

926
00:49:08,201 --> 00:49:10,536
(sighs) That's generous.

927
00:49:14,573 --> 00:49:16,642
Are you gonna kick some ass
for me?

928
00:49:16,776 --> 00:49:20,080
(shouting)

929
00:49:20,213 --> 00:49:22,015
Ricky: Quit fucking fighting me.

930
00:49:25,252 --> 00:49:26,987
(screams)

931
00:49:28,255 --> 00:49:29,688
You want this, huh?

932
00:49:30,223 --> 00:49:31,824
Open your fucking mouth.

933
00:49:32,993 --> 00:49:34,995
(engine revs)

934
00:49:35,128 --> 00:49:36,830
Hit 'em, baby, hit 'em.

935
00:49:41,567 --> 00:49:43,069
(tires screeching)

936
00:49:43,203 --> 00:49:44,436
(metal crashing)

937
00:49:44,570 --> 00:49:46,139
What the fuck?

938
00:49:46,273 --> 00:49:48,674
(shouting)

939
00:49:49,475 --> 00:49:50,442
Get him in the car!

940
00:49:50,576 --> 00:49:52,378
Get him in the car!

941
00:49:52,511 --> 00:49:53,880
(groaning)

942
00:49:54,014 --> 00:49:57,616
Vince: God damn it!
This fucking day is shit!

943
00:49:58,251 --> 00:50:00,653
(indistinct shouting)

944
00:50:02,289 --> 00:50:04,757
(screaming)

945
00:50:06,525 --> 00:50:08,327
Vince: Goddamn it! My fingers.

946
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:10,563
Woman: Go! Just go!
Drive!

947
00:50:10,696 --> 00:50:13,399
It's not starting!
It's not starting!

948
00:50:13,532 --> 00:50:15,467
(engine splutters)

949
00:50:15,601 --> 00:50:17,403
(engine revs)

950
00:50:18,138 --> 00:50:19,471
Woman: Go!

951
00:50:22,541 --> 00:50:24,978
(indistinct shouting)

952
00:50:52,339 --> 00:50:53,706
Brett.

953
00:50:53,874 --> 00:50:54,941
You're never gonna guess where
we are right now.

954
00:50:55,075 --> 00:50:56,775
No, no. No, Brett.

955
00:50:56,910 --> 00:50:59,678
- Cosmic bowling, dude.
- Mike: <i>Brett, I need your help.</i>

956
00:50:59,812 --> 00:51:01,680
<i>Listen. Brett, Brett.</i>

957
00:51:01,814 --> 00:51:03,649
- Everybody here sucks.
- No, Brett, listen.

958
00:51:03,782 --> 00:51:05,484
(indistinct chatter)

959
00:51:06,086 --> 00:51:07,287
(horn honks)

960
00:51:07,419 --> 00:51:09,089
Brett: <i>That's right! Pick it up!
Pick it up.</i>

961
00:51:09,222 --> 00:51:10,389
<i>That's down.</i>

962
00:51:10,789 --> 00:51:13,492
That's a strike! Well, close,
but that's a strike!

963
00:51:16,997 --> 00:51:17,998
Are you okay?

964
00:51:19,866 --> 00:51:21,167
Roger?

965
00:51:21,301 --> 00:51:22,501
Roger?

966
00:51:28,375 --> 00:51:29,775
(horn honks)

967
00:51:37,217 --> 00:51:38,550
Nurse: <i>Mike?</i>

968
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:40,186
<i>Mike!</i>

969
00:51:40,887 --> 00:51:41,687
Hey.

970
00:51:42,322 --> 00:51:45,424
The cops are gonna be here soon.
I'm just letting you know.

971
00:51:48,328 --> 00:51:49,762
And your grandma's awake.

972
00:51:49,896 --> 00:51:51,965
So, if you want to come back
and see her, you can.

973
00:51:52,098 --> 00:51:53,934
What about grandpa?

974
00:51:54,067 --> 00:51:55,201
Nurse: He's dead.

975
00:51:58,138 --> 00:52:00,206
(monitor beeps)

976
00:53:49,282 --> 00:53:50,250
(knocking)

977
00:53:53,319 --> 00:53:55,955
I know, I know this is what
everyone says,

978
00:53:56,089 --> 00:53:57,524
but I swear to you that...

979
00:53:57,656 --> 00:53:58,992
Duchovny:
It's not what it looks like.

980
00:53:59,792 --> 00:54:01,194
You're holding it for a friend?

981
00:54:01,995 --> 00:54:03,496
Spacemen made you do it?

982
00:54:03,629 --> 00:54:04,931
Okay, hold on.

983
00:54:10,103 --> 00:54:11,071
Okay, um...

984
00:54:11,204 --> 00:54:13,406
You know that
I got the car today,

985
00:54:13,540 --> 00:54:18,078
but that stuff must have been
in there before I got it,

986
00:54:18,211 --> 00:54:21,580
and I swear to you,
it's... it's not mine.

987
00:54:21,713 --> 00:54:22,815
It's not.

988
00:54:27,554 --> 00:54:28,955
It's not his.

989
00:54:31,157 --> 00:54:32,192
It's not his.

990
00:54:38,231 --> 00:54:40,900
(sighs) Thanks.

991
00:54:41,034 --> 00:54:42,768
- It's ours.
- What?

992
00:54:42,902 --> 00:54:45,305
(grunts, groans)

993
00:54:50,176 --> 00:54:53,812
Mike: Wait, wait, wait.
(grunts)

994
00:54:54,646 --> 00:54:55,482
Stop.

995
00:54:55,614 --> 00:54:58,017
(grunting)

996
00:55:03,523 --> 00:55:05,859
(Mike pants)

997
00:55:34,621 --> 00:55:35,855
Good boy.

998
00:55:39,791 --> 00:55:41,227
Thank you, Tony!

999
00:55:43,096 --> 00:55:44,097
(cheers)

1000
00:56:03,883 --> 00:56:04,984
Wait.

1001
00:56:05,418 --> 00:56:06,853
My...

1002
00:56:06,986 --> 00:56:08,955
Brett: (over phone)
<i>Yeah, that's my gutter queen!</i>

1003
00:56:10,590 --> 00:56:13,860
(mellow guitar music plays)

1004
00:56:13,993 --> 00:56:16,062
Oh, my God, Jurassic Park.

1005
00:56:16,896 --> 00:56:18,631
I got a pet velociraptor.

1006
00:56:18,764 --> 00:56:20,732
What did you do for Kelsey,
Mike?

1007
00:56:20,867 --> 00:56:24,237
(grunts)

1008
00:56:29,576 --> 00:56:32,711
(indistinct muttering)

1009
00:56:37,450 --> 00:56:38,784
Vince: Hey, hey.

1010
00:56:38,952 --> 00:56:39,953
- Hey, stop, stop, stop.
- Ricky: Hey, stop, stop.

1011
00:56:40,086 --> 00:56:41,588
What the fuck are you doing?

1012
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:44,624
Why are you waving your goddamn
gun at the fucking thing?

1013
00:56:44,756 --> 00:56:47,193
Vince: Because I'm trying to get
the fucking idiot to stop.

1014
00:56:47,327 --> 00:56:48,661
Fuck's sakes!

1015
00:56:48,995 --> 00:56:50,597
- Ricky: Fuck you, all right?
- In your wildest fucking dreams.

1016
00:56:50,729 --> 00:56:53,499
Ricky: Oh, God, that makes me
want to fucking vomit.

1017
00:56:58,371 --> 00:57:03,142
(grunts)

1018
00:57:03,276 --> 00:57:05,245
(pants)

1019
00:58:07,607 --> 00:58:10,209
Mike: Boom! I get knocked right
across the face with a flashlight.

1020
00:58:10,343 --> 00:58:12,078
I get...
I'm knocked down on the ground,

1021
00:58:12,211 --> 00:58:13,546
the other cop, he just starts
kicking me and kicking me,

1022
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:15,515
and then right after that,
he snorts cocaine.

1023
00:58:15,648 --> 00:58:17,417
He just snorted cocaine,
then they just take the car

1024
00:58:17,550 --> 00:58:20,119
and throw my bike out
and then run it over,

1025
00:58:20,253 --> 00:58:22,455
and yeah, that's...

1026
00:58:25,925 --> 00:58:27,593
that's how I'm late.

1027
00:58:30,496 --> 00:58:32,598
Kelsey: At least you still
have your ball sack.

1028
00:58:36,836 --> 00:58:40,373
(laughing)

1029
00:58:41,607 --> 00:58:42,842
(Mike sighs)

1030
00:58:43,576 --> 00:58:44,577
I'm sorry.

1031
00:58:46,312 --> 00:58:50,183
Well, I didn't have to third
wheel with Chet and the Porsche.

1032
00:58:50,616 --> 00:58:51,751
More like a fifth wheel.

1033
00:58:51,884 --> 00:58:53,419
So, there's a spare tire, then?

1034
00:58:53,653 --> 00:58:55,788
No, the donut.
That you really shouldn't even drive on.

1035
00:58:55,922 --> 00:58:57,357
That was me.

1036
00:58:57,824 --> 00:58:59,492
- You didn't even make it more than 50 miles, then?
- No, thank God

1037
00:58:59,625 --> 00:59:01,961
(laughing)

1038
00:59:03,529 --> 00:59:06,032
Are you sure you don't need like
an ice pack or something?

1039
00:59:06,165 --> 00:59:09,001
Um... I actually don't like it
when it's too cold

1040
00:59:09,135 --> 00:59:11,037
on the wound, it's weird.

1041
00:59:11,170 --> 00:59:12,972
- I don't know.
- (chuckles) What, why?

1042
00:59:13,106 --> 00:59:14,574
I don't know. Um...

1043
00:59:15,274 --> 00:59:17,577
- Like, 'cause...
- You're sensitive.

1044
00:59:18,010 --> 00:59:19,011
What?

1045
00:59:19,145 --> 00:59:20,413
Why are you embarrassed?

1046
00:59:21,748 --> 00:59:24,317
More people could use a little
more of that.

1047
00:59:24,450 --> 00:59:26,486
Like my parents.

1048
00:59:27,220 --> 00:59:29,288
Okay your mom did talk
about my car a lot.

1049
00:59:29,422 --> 00:59:33,459
It's ugly, but I honestly
just thought it was me...

1050
00:59:34,060 --> 00:59:35,495
showing up late.

1051
00:59:35,628 --> 00:59:38,531
No, they're great at reminding
me how shitty I am.

1052
00:59:40,066 --> 00:59:41,367
What makes you say that?

1053
00:59:43,603 --> 00:59:45,538
That doesn't sound like
something...

1054
00:59:45,671 --> 00:59:47,039
Something I would say?

1055
00:59:47,173 --> 00:59:48,641
Not really.

1056
00:59:48,775 --> 00:59:49,976
Why?

1057
00:59:50,476 --> 00:59:51,411
I mean, you...

1058
00:59:52,111 --> 00:59:55,281
You get a lot of things right
and I feel like you know that.

1059
00:59:55,415 --> 00:59:56,716
Oh, so you're calling me
arrogant?

1060
00:59:56,850 --> 00:59:59,385
- No, no. I just...
- I'm over confidant.

1061
00:59:59,519 --> 01:00:01,154
- No, Kelsey, you're...
- I'm...

1062
01:00:01,287 --> 01:00:04,424
Kelsey, you're perfect...
perfectly confident.

1063
01:00:06,592 --> 01:00:08,060
Nobody's perfect, Mike.

1064
01:00:09,729 --> 01:00:14,267
Okay, well, if we were all made
out of oatmeal...

1065
01:00:15,435 --> 01:00:16,702
(laughing)

1066
01:00:16,837 --> 01:00:18,171
What?

1067
01:00:18,304 --> 01:00:20,239
Listen, and like Goldilocks
walked in, okay,

1068
01:00:20,373 --> 01:00:22,208
- she'd pick your bowl.
- Oh, okay, yeah.

1069
01:00:22,475 --> 01:00:25,745
- Be the bowl she picked.
- So, the asshole, arrogant, swollen head oatmeal

1070
01:00:25,879 --> 01:00:28,581
- is over there?
- Exactly. And then, I'm on the other side of that.

1071
01:00:28,714 --> 01:00:30,283
- Well, that's not fun.
- You're in the middle.

1072
01:00:30,416 --> 01:00:31,617
Oh, okay,
so we're next to each other?

1073
01:00:31,751 --> 01:00:33,953
- Yeah, totally, yeah.
- Okay, well...

1074
01:00:34,420 --> 01:00:37,190
This bowl right here is big
enough for both of us.

1075
01:00:37,757 --> 01:00:40,960
I mean, that's Goldilocks' bowl.
I can't touch that. That's...

1076
01:00:41,093 --> 01:00:43,329
Yeah, but it's nice over here.

1077
01:00:46,999 --> 01:00:48,401
Not too warm?

1078
01:00:50,403 --> 01:00:52,438
- Not too cold.
- Yeah?

1079
01:00:56,976 --> 01:00:58,411
Well, uh... (chuckles)

1080
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:15,394
Actually, um...

1081
01:01:17,463 --> 01:01:19,265
- Do you want to...
- Come in?

1082
01:01:19,398 --> 01:01:21,000
Do you want... Yeah.

1083
01:01:21,667 --> 01:01:22,702
Finally.

1084
01:01:23,736 --> 01:01:25,204
Mike: Could of swore
I locked the door.

1085
01:01:25,338 --> 01:01:26,907
- This is it.
- Kelsey: Nice place.

1086
01:01:27,039 --> 01:01:28,741
This is our humble abode.

1087
01:01:29,308 --> 01:01:31,310
- Welcome.
- Kelsey: Oh, wow.

1088
01:01:31,945 --> 01:01:33,045
Who is this?

1089
01:01:33,179 --> 01:01:34,580
Mike: (scoffs) That's...
That's me.

1090
01:01:34,714 --> 01:01:36,749
Kelsey: So, this was taken
yesterday, obviously.

1091
01:01:36,884 --> 01:01:39,285
(scoffs) You want like a beer or
something?

1092
01:01:39,418 --> 01:01:40,686
Kelsey: Yeah, sure.

1093
01:01:41,922 --> 01:01:43,155
Wow, two sinks, huh?

1094
01:01:43,289 --> 01:01:45,525
Oh, yeah,
we're kinda fancy out here.

1095
01:01:45,758 --> 01:01:48,394
- Should I take my shoes off?
- No, no, you're fine.

1096
01:01:48,528 --> 01:01:50,530
Just don't put your feet
on the coffee table,

1097
01:01:50,663 --> 01:01:53,332
'cause my mom will have, like,
a heart attack,

1098
01:01:53,466 --> 01:01:55,234
and yeah, so no feet.

1099
01:01:57,203 --> 01:01:59,805
Um, I think, yeah,
Brett took all the beer,

1100
01:01:59,940 --> 01:02:01,307
but we have soda...

1101
01:02:06,579 --> 01:02:07,780
(mumbles)

1102
01:02:07,915 --> 01:02:09,115
(gunshot)

1103
01:02:10,716 --> 01:02:11,484
(gunshot)

1104
01:02:11,617 --> 01:02:12,853
Please stop goddamn moving.

1105
01:02:12,986 --> 01:02:15,054
Don't... Don't fucking move.

1106
01:02:15,187 --> 01:02:17,089
Get out from behind
the fucking fridge.

1107
01:02:18,291 --> 01:02:20,861
Move... Move from behind...

1108
01:02:20,994 --> 01:02:24,297
Move from behind the fridge!
And close the goddamn door.

1109
01:02:24,430 --> 01:02:26,165
You're letting
all the cold air out.

1110
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:30,403
Now, where's the fucking car?

1111
01:02:32,071 --> 01:02:33,172
Um...

1112
01:02:34,206 --> 01:02:35,441
I, um...

1113
01:02:36,442 --> 01:02:38,444
- I don't have it.
- (Dennis murmurs)

1114
01:02:39,478 --> 01:02:42,548
I swear, I'm not lying.
I don't have the car.

1115
01:02:42,682 --> 01:02:44,317
I swear,
just don't point it at her.

1116
01:02:44,450 --> 01:02:46,452
Well, I'm feeling a little bit
fucking confused.

1117
01:02:46,586 --> 01:02:47,955
A little confused right now,

1118
01:02:48,087 --> 01:02:49,589
because this patron saint
of the neighborhood,

1119
01:02:49,722 --> 01:02:55,494
he swore to me that he sold it
to you... today.

1120
01:02:55,628 --> 01:02:56,796
Well, technically,
it was yesterday,

1121
01:02:56,930 --> 01:02:58,531
it's past midnight, so...

1122
01:03:00,700 --> 01:03:02,735
Hey, hey I swear.
I don't have the car, man.

1123
01:03:02,869 --> 01:03:05,438
A couple of cops, they came and they
took it from me and they jumped me...

1124
01:03:05,571 --> 01:03:08,608
Just don't, no.
Just stop speaking.

1125
01:03:09,308 --> 01:03:13,179
I have been listening
to idiots speaking,

1126
01:03:13,312 --> 01:03:16,950
and excusing
for the last week-and-a-half,

1127
01:03:17,084 --> 01:03:19,585
and now,
when all I want to do...

1128
01:03:20,519 --> 01:03:24,523
is just drown myself in hard
alcohol, I can't.

1129
01:03:25,658 --> 01:03:28,527
'Cause one fucking idiot shot
another fucking idiot,

1130
01:03:28,661 --> 01:03:31,098
fucking up instructions
so goddamn simple,

1131
01:03:31,397 --> 01:03:33,766
my poor sweet nana,
who had Alzheimer's by the way,

1132
01:03:33,900 --> 01:03:35,969
she could have rolled out of
the goddamn grave

1133
01:03:36,103 --> 01:03:37,169
and done it herself.

1134
01:03:37,303 --> 01:03:38,905
I swear to Christ.

1135
01:03:39,039 --> 01:03:42,109
It's just like that fucking
short story, <i>Of Mice and Men,</i>

1136
01:03:42,642 --> 01:03:45,244
with the fucking...
the big guy...

1137
01:03:45,678 --> 01:03:48,180
It's a novella, actually.

1138
01:04:10,670 --> 01:04:11,838
Oh, God.

1139
01:04:12,271 --> 01:04:13,773
Am I the fucking idiot?

1140
01:04:15,608 --> 01:04:17,978
I'm the fucking idiot.
It's me.

1141
01:04:18,111 --> 01:04:19,278
I'm the fucking idiot.

1142
01:04:19,445 --> 01:04:20,981
(phone vibrates)

1143
01:04:21,114 --> 01:04:22,214
Excuse me.

1144
01:04:22,983 --> 01:04:24,250
Don't fucking move.

1145
01:04:25,052 --> 01:04:26,419
Hello?

1146
01:04:26,987 --> 01:04:28,421
- Vince: (over phone) <i>Oh, you finally pick up.</i>
- Yeah, what?

1147
01:04:28,554 --> 01:04:29,990
Vince: <i>Yeah, we need fucking...</i>

1148
01:04:30,289 --> 01:04:31,524
- Well, what the fuck is going on?
- (line breaks up)

1149
01:04:31,657 --> 01:04:32,993
(Vince speaks indistinctly)

1150
01:04:33,126 --> 01:04:36,063
I'm losing you. Do you have...
Hello? Hello?

1151
01:04:36,195 --> 01:04:37,396
I can't...

1152
01:04:39,598 --> 01:04:41,534
- (Dennis mumbles)
- I know how to find the car!

1153
01:04:41,667 --> 01:04:44,871
I know how to find the car!
I know... I know how to find it.

1154
01:04:45,371 --> 01:04:46,372
What?

1155
01:04:46,973 --> 01:04:49,542
My phone...
I dropped it in the car

1156
01:04:49,675 --> 01:04:53,312
before the cops took it.
I can track it on that app.

1157
01:04:53,813 --> 01:04:56,615
I lose my phone all the time.
Anyways, I can track it,

1158
01:04:56,749 --> 01:04:59,418
it can tell us exactly
where they are, but, um...

1159
01:05:00,252 --> 01:05:05,158
sir, if we show you,
you have to...

1160
01:05:05,892 --> 01:05:09,361
you have to let us go
and you can't kill anyone.

1161
01:05:09,495 --> 01:05:10,796
(Dennis shouts)

1162
01:05:11,230 --> 01:05:13,499
(Dennis sobs)

1163
01:05:17,269 --> 01:05:18,671
Mikey, is it?

1164
01:05:18,804 --> 01:05:19,739
Mike.

1165
01:05:20,372 --> 01:05:21,975
Mike. Thank you.

1166
01:05:23,944 --> 01:05:24,978
Mike.

1167
01:05:26,947 --> 01:05:29,015
If I don't get
my fucking drugs...

1168
01:05:34,520 --> 01:05:36,022
I'm gonna kill everyone.

1169
01:05:36,522 --> 01:05:37,858
Dennis: Mm-hm.

1170
01:05:38,491 --> 01:05:41,260
(tense guitar music plays)

1171
01:05:44,965 --> 01:05:49,202
Um... Okay.
So, give me one sec.

1172
01:05:49,702 --> 01:05:51,238
Looks like it's
in the middle of nowhere.

1173
01:05:51,370 --> 01:05:54,174
Not fucking good enough.
An address.

1174
01:05:54,306 --> 01:05:56,509
Okay, all right. Sorry.

1175
01:05:58,078 --> 01:05:59,678
Do you see that?

1176
01:06:00,579 --> 01:06:02,348
Do you know what,
I just wiped my feet

1177
01:06:02,481 --> 01:06:06,418
all over you
with a single fucking sentence?

1178
01:06:06,552 --> 01:06:09,789
That's why you are
where you are right now.

1179
01:06:10,190 --> 01:06:12,424
I bet you let your friends treat
you like shit, too, huh?

1180
01:06:12,558 --> 01:06:13,927
Like you know anything
about friends.

1181
01:06:14,060 --> 01:06:15,294
What?

1182
01:06:16,362 --> 01:06:17,463
What?

1183
01:06:18,497 --> 01:06:20,566
- What?
- Hm? Friends?

1184
01:06:20,699 --> 01:06:23,203
I know plenty
about fucking friendship.

1185
01:06:23,335 --> 01:06:25,906
Goddamn...
What's your name?

1186
01:06:26,039 --> 01:06:27,306
Kelsey.

1187
01:06:27,874 --> 01:06:29,542
Kelsey, why don't you take a look
at this motherfucker right here?

1188
01:06:29,675 --> 01:06:34,181
Hm? And see what happens
to rude goddamn fucking people

1189
01:06:34,313 --> 01:06:38,484
who fuck with people who have
goddamn guns in their hands.

1190
01:06:38,617 --> 01:06:42,189
Hey, Mike,
take it from me, this one,

1191
01:06:42,321 --> 01:06:44,356
she's going to steamroll
over you,

1192
01:06:44,490 --> 01:06:46,625
I swear to god, she is.

1193
01:06:47,928 --> 01:06:48,962
Oh, my God.

1194
01:06:49,361 --> 01:06:50,329
- What the fuck are you...
- Kid's got a fucking point.

1195
01:06:50,462 --> 01:06:51,630
Oh, my God.

1196
01:06:51,764 --> 01:06:53,133
You walk in the room
and all you do

1197
01:06:53,465 --> 01:06:54,935
is sour the fucking atmosphere
like a fart in church, man.

1198
01:06:55,068 --> 01:06:56,569
Hey, look in the...
I've got duct tape.

1199
01:06:56,702 --> 01:06:58,104
Dennis: Oh, phone call.
Must be the book club.

1200
01:06:58,238 --> 01:07:00,307
- Hey, what's their next book?
- Hey, look at me.

1201
01:07:00,439 --> 01:07:03,076
- Vince: (over phone) <i>Hello?</i>
- Where the fuck are you guys?

1202
01:07:03,210 --> 01:07:05,744
Oh, I don't know. Trying to
hitch a ride at 3:00 a.m.

1203
01:07:05,879 --> 01:07:08,681
on the scenic road
to east of fucking Eden

1204
01:07:08,814 --> 01:07:11,017
while Donnie's playing
demolition derby...

1205
01:07:11,151 --> 01:07:13,286
- Sounds like Vince. Double digit IQ.
- Huh?

1206
01:07:13,419 --> 01:07:16,655
Vince: So excuse me for not picking
up the phone. I was fucking...

1207
01:07:16,789 --> 01:07:18,457
Shut the fuck up and listen to
me for a second.

1208
01:07:18,591 --> 01:07:21,061
We are tracking the car
right now.

1209
01:07:21,194 --> 01:07:22,661
Where are you?

1210
01:07:22,896 --> 01:07:23,964
Captain: <i>Listen to me,
we're tracking the fucking car.</i>

1211
01:07:24,097 --> 01:07:25,265
Cap, hello?

1212
01:07:25,464 --> 01:07:27,067
The fucking...
Show me the fucking screen.

1213
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:29,035
- Come on! Where... Where...
- Dennis: Cup of coffee.

1214
01:07:29,169 --> 01:07:31,037
No cream, no sugar.
I'll take it black. I don't care.

1215
01:07:31,171 --> 01:07:32,906
What the fuck
are you talking about?

1216
01:07:33,039 --> 01:07:35,608
What are you talking about?
Find it!

1217
01:07:35,741 --> 01:07:36,809
Okay, it's still loading.

1218
01:07:36,943 --> 01:07:38,377
- Ten...
- Okay. Whoa! Whoa!

1219
01:07:38,510 --> 01:07:40,579
...nine, eight...
Hey! What the fuck?

1220
01:07:41,380 --> 01:07:43,116
- You see that?
- I'm gonna find it.

1221
01:07:43,250 --> 01:07:44,683
Work the fucker.

1222
01:07:44,885 --> 01:07:46,953
- Okay, okay.
- Captain: This thing got autopilot?

1223
01:07:47,087 --> 01:07:48,288
Oh, it's right here.

1224
01:07:48,787 --> 01:07:54,460
Give it to me.
It is off of Wilson Road.

1225
01:07:54,593 --> 01:07:57,297
<i>Five miles past Maury's Diner.</i>

1226
01:07:57,563 --> 01:07:59,032
- Vince: What's the address?
- Captain: <i>Huh?</i>

1227
01:07:59,165 --> 01:08:00,699
Vince: What's the fucking
address?

1228
01:08:01,001 --> 01:08:03,569
Captain: <i>Use the odometer and
your fucking eyeballs,</i>

1229
01:08:03,702 --> 01:08:05,437
<i>and figure it the fuck out!</i>

1230
01:08:05,571 --> 01:08:07,173
Ricky: What the fuck
is going on now?

1231
01:08:07,307 --> 01:08:08,507
Fuck!

1232
01:08:10,476 --> 01:08:11,978
(groans)

1233
01:08:12,112 --> 01:08:15,681
Take the fucking mask off.
It's got mace on it, stupid.

1234
01:08:15,814 --> 01:08:19,085
(groans) It's all right.
It's just in my eyes.

1235
01:08:20,120 --> 01:08:21,388
All right, come on.

1236
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:23,089
I'm gonna wash it for ya.
Come on.

1237
01:08:23,223 --> 01:08:24,456
Really?

1238
01:08:24,723 --> 01:08:26,092
I don't want you breathing in
that toxic shit.

1239
01:08:26,993 --> 01:08:28,627
It might kill you or something.

1240
01:08:29,195 --> 01:08:33,233
Vince: How am I supposed to find it
without a fucking address or a car?

1241
01:08:33,366 --> 01:08:34,901
My car just fucking...

1242
01:08:35,434 --> 01:08:36,602
Donnie!

1243
01:08:36,735 --> 01:08:38,405
Donnie! Donnie!
Stop that truck!

1244
01:08:38,537 --> 01:08:42,242
Donnie, no, don't let her leave!
Donnie, don't let her leave!

1245
01:08:42,375 --> 01:08:45,145
(shouting indistinctly)

1246
01:08:45,278 --> 01:08:46,947
Dennis: <i>If I'm gonna die,
I'd like to at least die</i>

1247
01:08:47,080 --> 01:08:48,747
at the hand's somebody
that would know

1248
01:08:48,882 --> 01:08:50,716
how to pour piss out of a boot
without having to read

1249
01:08:50,850 --> 01:08:52,484
the instructions
on the fucking heel.

1250
01:08:52,618 --> 01:08:54,154
Captain:
Hey, reach in the glove box.

1251
01:08:54,287 --> 01:08:56,488
There's duct tape in there,
give it to me.

1252
01:08:56,622 --> 01:08:58,524
- Hand it to me.
- Oh, great, more tape.

1253
01:08:58,657 --> 01:09:00,659
- (laughs) Thanks, sport.
- Shut the fuck...

1254
01:09:05,531 --> 01:09:08,734
(tense music plays)

1255
01:09:35,228 --> 01:09:36,229
Go around.

1256
01:09:59,152 --> 01:10:00,286
Hit the lights.

1257
01:10:41,727 --> 01:10:43,029
Hand me the fucking keys.

1258
01:10:46,099 --> 01:10:47,133
The keys.

1259
01:10:54,307 --> 01:10:55,208
Okay.

1260
01:10:56,342 --> 01:10:59,079
Everybody out
of the fucking car.

1261
01:10:59,212 --> 01:11:00,113
(door opens)

1262
01:11:01,281 --> 01:11:03,216
(indistinct chatter)

1263
01:11:03,349 --> 01:11:05,985
Man 1: All right.
I'm not supposed to say anything

1264
01:11:06,119 --> 01:11:10,223
but between me and you,
word on the street is

1265
01:11:10,356 --> 01:11:15,128
one of Tony's dumb ass dudes
shot him through a door.

1266
01:11:15,261 --> 01:11:16,896
Man 2: You gotta be fucking
kidding me.

1267
01:11:17,030 --> 01:11:18,664
Man 1: Look, you can't
make these things up, right?

1268
01:11:18,797 --> 01:11:20,366
Man 2: Are you saying
his own dude?

1269
01:11:20,500 --> 01:11:22,135
Man 1: Look, okay, first of all.

1270
01:11:22,268 --> 01:11:25,905
I was talking to the boss,
he said, on the phone,

1271
01:11:26,039 --> 01:11:30,110
this dude sounded like
the biggest idiot he ever heard

1272
01:11:30,243 --> 01:11:30,944
and you know...

1273
01:11:31,077 --> 01:11:32,644
Man 2: Did you hear that?

1274
01:11:33,513 --> 01:11:34,914
Man 1: Hear what?

1275
01:11:35,048 --> 01:11:36,983
Man 2: That noise out there.

1276
01:11:37,484 --> 01:11:38,918
Captain: Mike.

1277
01:11:39,052 --> 01:11:40,520
Man 1: Probably coyotes,
or werewolves, or something.

1278
01:11:40,652 --> 01:11:41,620
Man 2: I fucking heard it.

1279
01:11:41,753 --> 01:11:42,989
Captain: Go.

1280
01:11:44,357 --> 01:11:45,691
Man 2: What the fuck?

1281
01:11:47,127 --> 01:11:49,162
Kelsey: What are you gonna do?
Crawl through a vent somewhere?

1282
01:11:49,295 --> 01:11:50,597
I don't know, maybe.

1283
01:11:50,729 --> 01:11:52,731
Do like a human shield,
or something.

1284
01:11:52,866 --> 01:11:54,300
Yeah, you can go first.

1285
01:11:54,901 --> 01:11:56,436
Eye contact.

1286
01:11:56,569 --> 01:11:58,770
You are very fucking rude,
and let me tell you something,

1287
01:11:58,905 --> 01:12:00,340
it's not gonna get you far.

1288
01:12:00,473 --> 01:12:01,640
Just give me a fucking idea.

1289
01:12:01,773 --> 01:12:04,844
- (Dennis murmurs)
- (Mike grunts)

1290
01:12:05,744 --> 01:12:08,414
Hey, be fucking quiet.

1291
01:12:08,848 --> 01:12:11,184
(grunting)

1292
01:12:15,522 --> 01:12:16,856
(Mike coughs)

1293
01:12:17,257 --> 01:12:18,724
(groans)

1294
01:12:18,858 --> 01:12:20,226
Kelsey: Ow!

1295
01:12:20,360 --> 01:12:22,761
(grunting)

1296
01:12:24,663 --> 01:12:27,433
Go to sleep. God damn it!

1297
01:12:27,567 --> 01:12:28,902
(Kelsey whimpers)

1298
01:12:29,068 --> 01:12:31,670
Go to sleep. That's it.
That's it. That's it. Shh!

1299
01:12:31,803 --> 01:12:34,207
(grunting)

1300
01:12:39,846 --> 01:12:42,081
God! Fucking Christ!

1301
01:12:43,782 --> 01:12:46,186
(grunting)

1302
01:12:47,287 --> 01:12:48,354
Hey, stop.

1303
01:12:48,488 --> 01:12:49,322
Stop.

1304
01:12:49,455 --> 01:12:52,325
(grunting)

1305
01:12:53,725 --> 01:12:55,461
(pants)

1306
01:13:01,901 --> 01:13:04,137
Are you... Are you okay?

1307
01:13:06,472 --> 01:13:08,374
(Captain groans)

1308
01:13:08,508 --> 01:13:09,775
Mike: Are you okay?

1309
01:13:09,909 --> 01:13:11,844
Kelsey: Yeah,
just got to get his keys.

1310
01:13:11,978 --> 01:13:14,981
- (Captain groans)
- Where... Where's Dennis?

1311
01:13:22,922 --> 01:13:25,191
- What is he doing?
- (gunshot)

1312
01:13:25,325 --> 01:13:27,726
(Kelsey pants)

1313
01:13:34,300 --> 01:13:36,936
Date night just keep getting
better and better, don't it?

1314
01:13:59,492 --> 01:14:02,428
(indistinct chatter)

1315
01:14:02,562 --> 01:14:05,298
(laughing)

1316
01:14:05,431 --> 01:14:06,633
Look at this.

1317
01:14:06,765 --> 01:14:08,334
Hammer time.

1318
01:14:08,468 --> 01:14:10,003
Good shit right here.

1319
01:14:10,769 --> 01:14:12,038
Nice.

1320
01:14:14,907 --> 01:14:17,377
(metal clanging)

1321
01:14:32,425 --> 01:14:33,326
Michael.

1322
01:14:34,227 --> 01:14:36,863
(sniffs)
Thought we were done with you.

1323
01:14:37,897 --> 01:14:39,098
(Kelsey grunts)

1324
01:14:40,099 --> 01:14:43,503
(indistinct chatter)

1325
01:14:44,704 --> 01:14:47,173
Man: Ah, Tony.
Son of a bitch.

1326
01:14:51,744 --> 01:14:54,714
Dennis, your wife is worried
sick about you, by the way.

1327
01:14:54,847 --> 01:14:56,349
(Dennis mumbles)

1328
01:14:56,783 --> 01:14:58,985
And you look familiar.

1329
01:14:59,752 --> 01:15:02,422
Think There's a photograph
on a file on my desk.

1330
01:15:02,555 --> 01:15:03,923
Man 1: You get a break.

1331
01:15:04,390 --> 01:15:05,925
- Man 2: You get a break, we all get a break.
- (laughter)

1332
01:15:06,059 --> 01:15:08,328
- Davis: Tony's file.
- Fuck off, doughnut!

1333
01:15:08,995 --> 01:15:10,196
Excuse me?

1334
01:15:10,997 --> 01:15:12,899
Hey. (clears throat)

1335
01:15:13,032 --> 01:15:14,967
Sir, hey, hi.

1336
01:15:15,468 --> 01:15:16,969
Hey, sir.

1337
01:15:18,538 --> 01:15:19,439
Hello.

1338
01:15:20,606 --> 01:15:23,776
That... That is my score.

1339
01:15:24,644 --> 01:15:28,581
Me! I'm the one that brought
that to you.

1340
01:15:28,981 --> 01:15:30,350
We've been talking for weeks.

1341
01:15:30,483 --> 01:15:32,685
All right,
so I don't know how...

1342
01:15:32,819 --> 01:15:34,954
what the fuck happened?

1343
01:15:35,088 --> 01:15:37,457
UPS, FedEx.

1344
01:15:38,891 --> 01:15:40,526
- Fucking Pony Express.
- (laughs)

1345
01:15:40,660 --> 01:15:42,929
I don't care who delivers
my product.

1346
01:15:43,062 --> 01:15:45,465
The key word there, though,
is "delivery."

1347
01:15:45,598 --> 01:15:47,200
(men laughing)

1348
01:15:47,333 --> 01:15:49,001
Ah! Ah! See that's bullshit.

1349
01:15:49,135 --> 01:15:51,304
Hey, doughnut. What was the name
of the guy, his gang member,

1350
01:15:51,437 --> 01:15:52,905
the one he shot
through the door?

1351
01:15:53,039 --> 01:15:54,407
That was Tony.

1352
01:15:54,540 --> 01:15:58,344
Tony. Now that...
that's just poor leadership.

1353
01:15:58,478 --> 01:16:00,848
(men laughing)

1354
01:16:00,980 --> 01:16:02,448
Man: Fucking love the boss.

1355
01:16:02,682 --> 01:16:04,050
Captain: That... I didn't...
That wasn't me that shot him,

1356
01:16:04,183 --> 01:16:05,618
that was a guy that works for
me.

1357
01:16:05,752 --> 01:16:07,153
Man: Open it up, show her.

1358
01:16:19,198 --> 01:16:20,633
Captain:
Just like a fucking cop.

1359
01:16:21,234 --> 01:16:24,704
Wiping your ass with
a hard-working civilian.

1360
01:16:24,838 --> 01:16:26,973
Duchovny: Whoa, whoa.
Did I just hear him right?

1361
01:16:27,106 --> 01:16:28,741
Did he just volunteer to die
first?

1362
01:16:29,008 --> 01:16:31,144
- Dennis: Mm-hm.
- Davis: I was tuning him out, I wasn't listening.

1363
01:16:31,277 --> 01:16:33,913
I assumed you would
want to kill Michael first.

1364
01:16:38,050 --> 01:16:39,719
Oh. Excuse me, sorry.

1365
01:16:39,853 --> 01:16:42,021
we're just trying to get out
to clear the mess.

1366
01:16:42,155 --> 01:16:43,289
Duchovny: We got a lot
of body weight

1367
01:16:43,423 --> 01:16:44,524
for just a couple trash bags.

1368
01:16:44,657 --> 01:16:46,259
Oh, these are not
just trash bags.

1369
01:16:46,392 --> 01:16:48,227
These are industrial strength,
commercial grade,

1370
01:16:48,361 --> 01:16:49,562
- contractor bags.
- Duchovny: Really?

1371
01:16:49,695 --> 01:16:51,497
Yeah.
Man, we got these from Lowes.

1372
01:16:51,631 --> 01:16:53,099
Man: Hold a big load,
no tears, no spills.

1373
01:16:53,232 --> 01:16:54,400
Davis: They don't leak at all?

1374
01:16:54,534 --> 01:16:55,435
Man: No ma'am.

1375
01:16:55,568 --> 01:16:57,203
I've used these.
They fucking leak.

1376
01:16:57,336 --> 01:17:00,039
- $3.99 a box on aisle three.
- Davis: Very good.

1377
01:17:00,173 --> 01:17:01,707
Captain: Right next to
the industrial hardware.

1378
01:17:01,842 --> 01:17:02,942
(drill whirs)

1379
01:17:03,075 --> 01:17:05,645
- Don't touch him!
- (grunting)

1380
01:17:06,045 --> 01:17:07,313
(gun cocks)

1381
01:17:09,282 --> 01:17:12,251
Sorry, do we need a bag
underneath him before we shoot?

1382
01:17:14,220 --> 01:17:16,055
Vince: Five miles past
the fucking diner?

1383
01:17:16,189 --> 01:17:17,723
Ricky: This is fucking weird.
I don't like it.

1384
01:17:17,925 --> 01:17:20,326
Vince: Looks like fucking...
"Hills Has Eyes" or <i>Deliverance.</i>

1385
01:17:20,460 --> 01:17:22,261
- Ricky: <i>Hills Have Eyes.</i>
- Shannon: Uh, hey, guys.

1386
01:17:22,395 --> 01:17:24,297
- I think he's over there.
- Vince: What the fuck?

1387
01:17:24,430 --> 01:17:28,234
Everybody, get down!
Everybody, get fucking down!

1388
01:17:28,367 --> 01:17:29,202
Ricky: Motherfucker!

1389
01:17:29,335 --> 01:17:31,137
(overlapping shouting)

1390
01:17:31,270 --> 01:17:32,873
- What took so goddamn long?
- I don't know.

1391
01:17:33,005 --> 01:17:35,007
What the fuck are you doing?
What's all this shit?

1392
01:17:35,141 --> 01:17:36,576
- Jesus Christ!
- Get the fuck away.

1393
01:17:36,877 --> 01:17:38,711
- Put your guns down or I'll explode.
- (overlapping shouting)

1394
01:17:38,846 --> 01:17:40,646
Wait a second!

1395
01:17:40,780 --> 01:17:44,016
Everybody, just wait one second.

1396
01:17:44,584 --> 01:17:49,522
We need to take a moment
to think and be civil,

1397
01:17:49,655 --> 01:17:53,626
and I assure you,
we can all get what we need...

1398
01:17:53,759 --> 01:17:55,261
from this situation.

1399
01:17:55,995 --> 01:17:57,296
- What do you want?
- The coke.

1400
01:17:57,430 --> 01:17:58,731
And the product
is on the premises,

1401
01:17:58,866 --> 01:18:01,334
- we have an arrangement.
- Absolutely.

1402
01:18:02,268 --> 01:18:04,203
All of you, what do you want?

1403
01:18:04,337 --> 01:18:05,771
Shannon: We want our boss.

1404
01:18:07,206 --> 01:18:08,374
Davis: Yeah. This man?

1405
01:18:08,508 --> 01:18:09,843
- Shannon: Yeah.
- Ricky: That's right.

1406
01:18:10,009 --> 01:18:11,777
Shannon: Yeah, we're not
leaving here without him.

1407
01:18:12,111 --> 01:18:14,180
- Ricky: That's right.
- Vince: That's right. - Yeah, all right.

1408
01:18:14,313 --> 01:18:16,382
Yeah, and you know what, we're not
leaving without the money either.

1409
01:18:16,516 --> 01:18:18,584
- That's right.
- Oh, I think there's money enough for more than one party.

1410
01:18:18,718 --> 01:18:20,553
- What the fuck?
- No, hear me out, okay.

1411
01:18:20,686 --> 01:18:23,456
We both deserve to be compensated
for the work we've done,

1412
01:18:23,589 --> 01:18:25,658
but since we actually did
deliver the product,

1413
01:18:25,791 --> 01:18:27,861
- I propose 60/40 split.
- That's fucking bullshit!

1414
01:18:27,995 --> 01:18:29,128
Are you kidding?

1415
01:18:29,262 --> 01:18:30,596
Do you know how much
fucking work

1416
01:18:30,730 --> 01:18:32,966
I just did to get this fucking
shit together?

1417
01:18:33,099 --> 01:18:35,635
- I got my fucking hand slammed in the fucking door.
- (Ricky shouts indistinctly)

1418
01:18:35,768 --> 01:18:37,871
- I had to hitchhike...
- Ricky: Who fucking cares?

1419
01:18:38,005 --> 01:18:41,140
Okay, we can just kill him now.
It's no skin off my nose.

1420
01:18:41,274 --> 01:18:42,275
No, no,
you're not gonna kill any.

1421
01:18:42,408 --> 01:18:43,643
You know what? You know what?

1422
01:18:43,776 --> 01:18:45,111
I dare you
to pull the fucking trigger.

1423
01:18:45,244 --> 01:18:46,779
Davis:
I'll just kill him right now.

1424
01:18:46,914 --> 01:18:48,548
Captain: Guys, shut the fuck up!

1425
01:18:48,681 --> 01:18:50,416
Vince: I'll fucking waste you,
you fucking pig.

1426
01:18:50,616 --> 01:18:52,552
- How do you feel about that?
- Ricky: ...the fucking shot.

1427
01:18:52,685 --> 01:18:57,189
Hey! Can we do 50/50 plus a long
term partnership?

1428
01:19:00,760 --> 01:19:01,827
Donnie...

1429
01:19:04,163 --> 01:19:06,532
I'll put your fucking nuts
in a jar.

1430
01:19:06,666 --> 01:19:07,567
Shut up!

1431
01:19:10,102 --> 01:19:12,005
We already did this on accident.

1432
01:19:12,772 --> 01:19:15,675
They were able to bring the
drugs easy because they're cops.

1433
01:19:16,910 --> 01:19:19,812
If we let them deliver for us
in the future, it'd be safer...

1434
01:19:20,513 --> 01:19:21,781
for all of us, right?

1435
01:19:23,182 --> 01:19:24,417
That's a fine proposal.

1436
01:19:24,918 --> 01:19:27,186
Man: He must be the genius of
their group, boss.

1437
01:19:27,820 --> 01:19:31,858
Donnie, that's...
that's actually not a bad idea.

1438
01:19:35,028 --> 01:19:38,564
Are we fucking good?
Can I... Can I go now?

1439
01:19:39,066 --> 01:19:41,500
What about these three? They seen
our faces, they still need to go.

1440
01:19:41,634 --> 01:19:43,369
You should have worn
a fucking mask!

1441
01:19:43,502 --> 01:19:45,104
Davis:
They're our responsibility...

1442
01:19:45,839 --> 01:19:50,710
and we will handle them as soon
as we all take a breath...

1443
01:19:51,277 --> 01:19:52,745
and lower our weapons.

1444
01:19:56,349 --> 01:19:57,617
On three.

1445
01:19:59,987 --> 01:20:01,220
One...

1446
01:20:04,457 --> 01:20:06,626
- (gasps)
- Davis: ...two...

1447
01:20:12,131 --> 01:20:13,232
three.

1448
01:20:16,202 --> 01:20:17,503
Go ahead and lower.

1449
01:20:17,637 --> 01:20:20,272
- Easy 'em down, guys.
- Bring 'em down, boys.

1450
01:20:23,609 --> 01:20:25,211
- (sighs)
- (gunshot)

1451
01:20:25,778 --> 01:20:26,779
Oh, Jesus!

1452
01:20:26,913 --> 01:20:30,316
(gunfire)

1453
01:20:34,253 --> 01:20:36,089
(screaming)

1454
01:20:36,222 --> 01:20:37,223
Dennis!

1455
01:20:37,356 --> 01:20:39,525
(gunfire)

1456
01:20:42,294 --> 01:20:45,231
(indistinct shouting)

1457
01:20:45,364 --> 01:20:47,233
Get me the fuck outta here!

1458
01:20:47,366 --> 01:20:49,702
(gunfire)

1459
01:20:52,471 --> 01:20:54,707
Ricky: All right give me
your shell. A fucking shell!

1460
01:20:54,841 --> 01:20:55,675
Donnie!

1461
01:20:55,808 --> 01:20:59,112
(gunfire)

1462
01:20:59,245 --> 01:21:00,780
We have to get out of here.

1463
01:21:01,380 --> 01:21:03,850
- Motherfucker.
- Fucking light 'em up!

1464
01:21:03,984 --> 01:21:06,686
(heavy gunfire)

1465
01:21:08,421 --> 01:21:10,823
(indistinct shouting)

1466
01:21:13,860 --> 01:21:16,228
(gunfire continues)

1467
01:21:19,265 --> 01:21:20,399
Come on.

1468
01:21:20,533 --> 01:21:25,839
- (gunfire)
- (indistinct shouting)

1469
01:21:32,678 --> 01:21:33,579
Shannon.

1470
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:35,614
Look at me.

1471
01:21:36,582 --> 01:21:38,551
Get the fucking money.

1472
01:21:39,518 --> 01:21:41,888
The bag!
Get the fucking bag!

1473
01:21:42,022 --> 01:21:43,422
(gunfire)

1474
01:21:43,556 --> 01:21:45,825
- Mike: Go, go, go!
- Kelsey: Out there. Go, go!

1475
01:21:47,160 --> 01:21:50,097
(gunfire)

1476
01:21:50,229 --> 01:21:51,597
Go, go, go.

1477
01:21:51,731 --> 01:21:54,266
(gunfire)

1478
01:21:55,836 --> 01:21:56,669
Fuck you!

1479
01:21:56,802 --> 01:21:59,438
(gunfire)

1480
01:22:01,307 --> 01:22:02,876
(man groans)

1481
01:22:07,080 --> 01:22:08,849
(gunfire)

1482
01:22:08,982 --> 01:22:12,318
Captain: Shannon! Shannon!
Go get the money.

1483
01:22:12,451 --> 01:22:13,686
(gunfire)

1484
01:22:13,819 --> 01:22:15,688
You can do it!
You can do it!

1485
01:22:15,821 --> 01:22:17,723
- What the fuck?
- Jesus Christ!

1486
01:22:17,858 --> 01:22:20,760
- Shannon: All right, Captain.
- No wait, Shannon, stop!

1487
01:22:20,894 --> 01:22:21,827
Fuck.

1488
01:22:21,962 --> 01:22:23,930
- (gunfire)
- Man: I'm out! I'm out!

1489
01:22:24,064 --> 01:22:25,765
(gunfire)

1490
01:22:25,899 --> 01:22:26,900
Fuck!

1491
01:22:28,434 --> 01:22:29,635
Fucker!

1492
01:22:31,071 --> 01:22:32,172
Man: I'm out.

1493
01:22:32,304 --> 01:22:33,974
(indistinct shouting)

1494
01:22:36,776 --> 01:22:37,878
Yeah.

1495
01:22:38,011 --> 01:22:40,046
(gunshots)

1496
01:22:40,180 --> 01:22:41,447
Ricky: Fuck!

1497
01:22:42,082 --> 01:22:44,383
- Shannon!
- Fuck!

1498
01:22:44,517 --> 01:22:47,254
- (gunshots)
- (indistinct shouting)

1499
01:22:47,386 --> 01:22:49,189
Vince: Come on, bring him back,
come on!

1500
01:22:49,990 --> 01:22:52,291
- Mike: What do we do?
- Man: Who's left over?

1501
01:22:52,424 --> 01:22:53,692
Who do we got?

1502
01:22:53,826 --> 01:22:55,594
Kelsey: We could take that truck
right there.

1503
01:22:55,728 --> 01:22:57,363
What if it's locked?

1504
01:22:57,763 --> 01:22:59,598
What if there are no keys?

1505
01:22:59,732 --> 01:23:03,003
- (gunfire)
- (indistinct shouting)

1506
01:23:03,136 --> 01:23:04,670
Ricky: I got you.
You're gonna be okay.

1507
01:23:04,804 --> 01:23:06,173
You're gonna be fine,
don't worry about it.

1508
01:23:06,305 --> 01:23:08,074
(gunfire)

1509
01:23:08,208 --> 01:23:09,441
Fuck!

1510
01:23:09,775 --> 01:23:11,011
- Shannon: Leave it.
- Ricky: You're gonna be fine.

1511
01:23:11,144 --> 01:23:12,344
- Shannon: Leave my mask on.
- Shannon.

01:23:12,478 --> 01:23:13,445
(gunfire)

1513
01:23:13,579 --> 01:23:14,780
Shannon: Leave it.

1514
01:23:14,915 --> 01:23:16,249
Hey, lot of books to read,
all right?

1515
01:23:16,382 --> 01:23:17,918
You can come over to my place.

1516
01:23:18,051 --> 01:23:21,888
We'll watch fucking <i>Titanic,</i>
all right?

1517
01:23:23,890 --> 01:23:24,790
Shannon?

1518
01:23:26,026 --> 01:23:27,359
Shannon?

1519
01:23:31,965 --> 01:23:34,167
- (sobs) No.
- Vince: No!

1520
01:23:34,301 --> 01:23:36,368
- (gunfire)
- Fuck!

1521
01:23:39,072 --> 01:23:40,273
Fuck you!

1522
01:23:40,406 --> 01:23:42,108
(gunfire)

1523
01:23:42,242 --> 01:23:43,342
Fuck you!

1524
01:23:44,110 --> 01:23:45,011
Fuck you!

1525
01:23:45,145 --> 01:23:47,513
(gunfire)

1526
01:23:49,381 --> 01:23:51,483
Fuck you! Fuck you!

1527
01:23:53,019 --> 01:23:54,386
Fuck! Fuck you!

1528
01:23:54,520 --> 01:23:56,089
- (gunfire)
- (indistinct shouting)

1529
01:23:56,223 --> 01:23:57,556
Man: I'm out! I'm out! I'm out!

1530
01:23:58,457 --> 01:24:01,460
Man: You're gonna get
fucking shot, you crazy bitch.

1531
01:24:01,594 --> 01:24:06,199
- (gunfire)
- (indistinct shouting)

1532
01:24:06,765 --> 01:24:09,336
Ricky: Fuckers!
Come on! That's right.

1533
01:24:09,468 --> 01:24:10,803
- (gunshots)
- (Davis grunts)

1534
01:24:10,937 --> 01:24:13,772
- Captain: Oh, shit.
- (Vince yells)

1535
01:24:13,907 --> 01:24:15,008
(gunfire)

1536
01:24:15,208 --> 01:24:16,542
Go, go. Get the fuck
out of here! God damn it!

1537
01:24:16,675 --> 01:24:19,980
- (gunfire)
- (indistinct shouting)

1538
01:24:20,113 --> 01:24:22,048
You can thank me later for
saving your fucking life.

1539
01:24:22,182 --> 01:24:25,751
(heavy gunfire)

1540
01:24:25,886 --> 01:24:28,654
Ricky: (screams) No, Vince!

1541
01:24:28,787 --> 01:24:30,957
- You motherfuckers!
- (gunfire)

1542
01:24:31,091 --> 01:24:34,627
I'm gonna fucking kill
every one of you.

1543
01:24:34,760 --> 01:24:37,063
- (Ricky yells)
- (gunfire)

1544
01:24:37,197 --> 01:24:38,098
Donnie.

1545
01:24:39,132 --> 01:24:40,432
(heavy gunfire)

1546
01:24:40,566 --> 01:24:42,468
Ricky: Motherfucker! (yells)

1547
01:24:42,601 --> 01:24:44,204
Fucking shoot them.
Fuck you!

1548
01:24:44,337 --> 01:24:46,438
(gunfire)

1549
01:24:46,572 --> 01:24:47,806
(groaning)

1550
01:24:47,941 --> 01:24:52,012
(gunfire)

1551
01:24:52,444 --> 01:24:56,917
- (gunfire)
- (indistinct shouting)

1552
01:24:58,051 --> 01:24:59,853
(gunfire)

1553
01:25:02,289 --> 01:25:03,555
We gotta get those keys.

1554
01:25:03,689 --> 01:25:06,893
(distorted gunfire)

1555
01:25:09,963 --> 01:25:10,864
Mike.

1556
01:25:12,198 --> 01:25:13,333
We can do it.

1557
01:25:13,465 --> 01:25:16,535
- (gunfire)
- (indistinct shouting)

1558
01:25:18,204 --> 01:25:19,471
Mike: Let's do this.

1559
01:25:20,407 --> 01:25:22,708
(gunfire)

1560
01:25:31,717 --> 01:25:33,086
Man: It's not good enough.

1561
01:25:33,219 --> 01:25:35,088
- Kelsey: Where are the keys?
- (horn honking)

1562
01:25:35,221 --> 01:25:36,156
Man: Reload.

1563
01:25:36,289 --> 01:25:37,424
Mike: Oh, shit. We gotta go.

1564
01:25:37,556 --> 01:25:40,226
- (gunfire)
- (engine splutters)

1565
01:25:40,360 --> 01:25:42,228
Kelsey: Let's go! Go, go!

1566
01:25:42,362 --> 01:25:43,762
(engine revs)

1567
01:25:46,598 --> 01:25:49,035
(indistinct shouting)

1568
01:25:54,240 --> 01:25:56,109
Mike: Oh, shit!

1569
01:26:10,457 --> 01:26:11,992
Fuck 'em, I'm leaving.

1570
01:26:17,063 --> 01:26:18,098
(gunshot)

1571
01:26:18,231 --> 01:26:19,665
(engine revs)

1572
01:26:19,798 --> 01:26:21,234
(tense music plays)

1573
01:26:21,368 --> 01:26:22,634
What... What do we do?

1574
01:26:22,768 --> 01:26:23,702
We don't call the cops,
that's for fucking sure.

1575
01:26:23,837 --> 01:26:25,804
Yeah, I totally agree.

1576
01:26:29,641 --> 01:26:31,044
You should have let me drive,
Davis.

1577
01:26:31,177 --> 01:26:34,214
I drive. I always drive.
You shoot.

1578
01:26:40,920 --> 01:26:42,688
- Mike!
- Yeah?

1579
01:26:42,821 --> 01:26:45,859
- They have a gun.
- (gunfire)

1580
01:26:48,895 --> 01:26:50,130
Kelsey:
On a scale of one to ten,

1581
01:26:50,263 --> 01:26:51,663
how much fun are you having
right now?

1582
01:26:51,797 --> 01:26:53,466
Eight point six out of ten.

1583
01:26:54,100 --> 01:26:56,735
That's how bad it hurts
right now, bro.

1584
01:27:02,308 --> 01:27:06,079
- Man: Nice guys finish last.
- Chet: I thought we had something.

1585
01:27:06,212 --> 01:27:09,215
It's like, it's like girls speak
in code.

1586
01:27:09,349 --> 01:27:10,749
And I'm no Nick Cage.

1587
01:27:10,884 --> 01:27:13,086
I'm no Nick Cage,
I can't crack codes that fast.

1588
01:27:13,219 --> 01:27:14,320
No one can.

1589
01:27:15,021 --> 01:27:16,122
(sobs)

1590
01:27:16,256 --> 01:27:19,926
I'd fail in a <i>National Treasure</i>
scenario.

1591
01:27:24,130 --> 01:27:25,198
We all would.

1592
01:27:25,331 --> 01:27:27,867
(country music plays)

1593
01:27:31,471 --> 01:27:32,671
We all would.

1594
01:27:33,206 --> 01:27:35,175
- (gunfire)
- Kelsey: What's the plan, Mike?

1595
01:27:35,308 --> 01:27:37,810
Mike: Um... Stay alive.
I don't know. I don't...

1596
01:27:37,944 --> 01:27:39,479
Well, is there something we can
throw out the window?

1597
01:27:39,611 --> 01:27:41,814
- Uh...
- Pop a tire or something?

1598
01:27:42,315 --> 01:27:43,983
(gunfire)

1599
01:27:44,817 --> 01:27:46,618
- You shoot them?
- I am shooting them.

1600
01:27:46,752 --> 01:27:49,489
You're shooting around them.
Shoot them.

1601
01:27:49,621 --> 01:27:51,057
(gunfire)

1602
01:27:53,293 --> 01:27:55,028
- Kid! Hey, Mike!
- (both scream)

1603
01:27:55,161 --> 01:27:56,563
You are not the fucking man
for this job.

1604
01:27:56,695 --> 01:27:57,696
- Give me the...
- (Kelsey screams)

1605
01:27:57,831 --> 01:27:59,566
Captain: Oh, shit. God damn it.

1606
01:27:59,698 --> 01:28:01,835
(gunfire)

1607
01:28:05,704 --> 01:28:07,340
(grunting)

1608
01:28:07,474 --> 01:28:10,143
Captain:
Let me drive the fucking car!

1609
01:28:10,276 --> 01:28:12,711
(grunting)

1610
01:28:18,518 --> 01:28:19,618
Mike: Hey, get off!

1611
01:28:19,785 --> 01:28:21,121
Captain: Jesus!
Watch the fucking road.

1612
01:28:21,254 --> 01:28:23,223
Are you crazy? Are you crazy?

1613
01:28:23,356 --> 01:28:25,325
Fucking maniac!

1614
01:28:25,458 --> 01:28:26,893
(gunfire)

1615
01:28:27,026 --> 01:28:28,361
(Duchovny groans)

1616
01:28:30,696 --> 01:28:32,031
(gun clicks)

1617
01:28:32,165 --> 01:28:33,867
- Fuck!
- Just get in the car, sit down.

1618
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:35,468
- I'm out.
- Sit down.

1619
01:28:35,602 --> 01:28:37,370
I'm out, Davis.

1620
01:28:38,471 --> 01:28:39,539
What are you doing?

1621
01:28:39,671 --> 01:28:41,074
I got more rounds in my pistol.

1622
01:28:41,207 --> 01:28:43,376
- I said get back in the car.
- Davis, I got it.

1623
01:28:43,510 --> 01:28:44,878
I said, sit down.

1624
01:28:46,745 --> 01:28:47,981
Sit.

1625
01:28:48,114 --> 01:28:49,182
Now.

1626
01:28:49,315 --> 01:28:52,218
(tense music plays)

1627
01:28:56,523 --> 01:28:57,991
I'll do it myself.

1628
01:29:00,326 --> 01:29:02,495
Mike!
Throw something out the window.

1629
01:29:02,629 --> 01:29:05,899
Let me drive the fucking car.

1630
01:29:06,798 --> 01:29:08,501
- Kelsey: Fuck you!
- Captain: Fuck you!

1631
01:29:09,035 --> 01:29:10,370
Kelsey: Get off me.

1632
01:29:12,272 --> 01:29:13,772
(grunting)

1633
01:29:15,807 --> 01:29:17,177
Captain: Jesus!

1634
01:29:19,979 --> 01:29:21,680
You started this.

1635
01:29:25,518 --> 01:29:26,419
(gunshot)

1636
01:29:26,853 --> 01:29:28,154
(Davis splutters)

1637
01:29:28,288 --> 01:29:29,821
I told you
you should have let me drive.

1638
01:29:29,956 --> 01:29:31,291
(gunshots)

1639
01:29:36,930 --> 01:29:40,166
I told you... (coughs)
I would do this myself.

1640
01:29:41,100 --> 01:29:43,303
(groans)

1641
01:29:46,472 --> 01:29:49,242
- (gun cocks)
- (Duchovny pants)

1642
01:29:54,247 --> 01:29:56,316
- (gunshot)
- (engine revs)

1643
01:29:58,618 --> 01:29:59,751
Whoa!

1644
01:30:06,392 --> 01:30:07,293
(crash)

1645
01:30:13,266 --> 01:30:14,701
Holy shit!

1646
01:30:14,834 --> 01:30:17,003
(explosion)

1647
01:30:17,637 --> 01:30:18,737
No!

1648
01:30:18,871 --> 01:30:20,772
(tense music plays)

1649
01:30:20,907 --> 01:30:24,776
You are so fucking rude!

1650
01:30:25,912 --> 01:30:27,380
Mike! Mike!

1651
01:30:27,947 --> 01:30:30,250
- Oh, shit!
- (tires screech)

1652
01:30:37,390 --> 01:30:39,058
(Mike pants)

1653
01:30:39,192 --> 01:30:40,159
Kelsey.

1654
01:30:40,893 --> 01:30:42,595
Are you... You okay?

1655
01:30:43,029 --> 01:30:45,064
- Yeah.
- (Mike sighs)

1656
01:30:46,366 --> 01:30:48,468
(both pant)

1657
01:30:48,601 --> 01:30:49,669
Is that?

1658
01:30:49,801 --> 01:30:51,004
Mike?

1659
01:30:53,840 --> 01:30:55,008
Mike?

1660
01:30:55,308 --> 01:30:56,775
Darla: Get out of the car!
Put your hands up!

1661
01:30:56,909 --> 01:30:57,744
You gotta have a horseshoe up
your ass, man.

1662
01:30:57,877 --> 01:30:59,012
Where are the others?

1663
01:30:59,279 --> 01:31:00,647
You're like the luckiest son of
a bitch I know.

1664
01:31:00,779 --> 01:31:02,315
- Money, drugs, where is it?
- It's in the car.

1665
01:31:05,752 --> 01:31:07,854
Dennis: (chuckles) Holy shit.

1666
01:31:10,990 --> 01:31:12,925
Holy shit.

1667
01:31:13,059 --> 01:31:14,961
- (Captain groans)
- Darla: What is it?

1668
01:31:17,463 --> 01:31:18,431
Baby, what is it?

1669
01:31:20,466 --> 01:31:22,135
(Captain groans)

1670
01:31:29,475 --> 01:31:30,510
Is that the guy?

1671
01:31:34,981 --> 01:31:36,149
What do we do?

1672
01:31:36,282 --> 01:31:37,784
We gotta do something.
We gotta...

1673
01:31:38,584 --> 01:31:41,654
That's the guy who did it.
What do we do?

1674
01:31:41,788 --> 01:31:43,189
Dennis, what do we do?

1675
01:31:43,623 --> 01:31:45,091
Do you want to kill him?

1676
01:31:48,995 --> 01:31:50,229
Do you want to?

1677
01:31:58,638 --> 01:32:00,573
- Stop!
- (Darla gasps)

1678
01:32:00,707 --> 01:32:01,974
Stop!

1679
01:32:04,777 --> 01:32:07,246
(sighs) I... I, um...

1680
01:32:08,114 --> 01:32:10,016
I can't...
I can't let you kill him.

1681
01:32:11,617 --> 01:32:13,019
Hey, um...

1682
01:32:16,356 --> 01:32:17,357
Don't...

1683
01:32:18,024 --> 01:32:19,292
Don't be like them.

1684
01:32:24,297 --> 01:32:26,933
I know you're scared, okay. I...

1685
01:32:30,303 --> 01:32:32,205
I've been scared my whole life.

1686
01:32:37,377 --> 01:32:38,444
It's okay.

1687
01:33:01,367 --> 01:33:02,902
Dennis: You heard him.

1688
01:33:04,170 --> 01:33:05,571
Take a walk.

1689
01:33:12,044 --> 01:33:13,246
(door opens)

1690
01:33:41,941 --> 01:33:44,644
Well, I hope you're feeling
all fucking warm and fuzzy

1691
01:33:44,777 --> 01:33:46,145
and all that good shit, kid.

1692
01:33:46,279 --> 01:33:48,414
'Cause I'm feeling pretty good
right now.

1693
01:33:50,116 --> 01:33:51,384
(Darla grunts)

1694
01:33:52,552 --> 01:33:53,453
Baby, we happy?

1695
01:33:53,586 --> 01:33:56,222
- Yeah.
- (chuckles) We are happy.

1696
01:33:58,257 --> 01:33:59,625
(grunts) Keys.

1697
01:34:08,201 --> 01:34:09,635
(keys jingle)

1698
01:34:09,769 --> 01:34:12,438
You know, kid, we're kinda doing
you a huge favor here.

1699
01:34:12,572 --> 01:34:15,007
You're walking off
with a scot-free record.

1700
01:34:15,141 --> 01:34:17,210
As far as anybody else
is concerned,

1701
01:34:18,311 --> 01:34:20,346
you ain't ever seen
this fucking car.

1702
01:34:22,381 --> 01:34:24,050
Let's go, baby.
I'm following you.

1703
01:34:24,183 --> 01:34:25,985
I got no GPS in here.

1704
01:34:27,787 --> 01:34:29,555
(engine splutters)

1705
01:34:29,689 --> 01:34:31,057
(engine revs)

1706
01:34:33,226 --> 01:34:36,329
Tony, I love you forever,
brother.

1707
01:34:37,363 --> 01:34:40,466
Come on, baby, let's hit it.
We got daiquiris to drink.

1708
01:34:41,801 --> 01:34:44,103
- <i>Adios,</i> Mikey.
- (tires screech)

1709
01:35:00,219 --> 01:35:03,155
(breathes heavily)

1710
01:35:04,457 --> 01:35:05,458
(sighs)

1711
01:35:09,262 --> 01:35:11,097
I think we should
call Brett now.

1712
01:35:13,499 --> 01:35:14,534
Yeah.

1713
01:35:17,036 --> 01:35:18,404
(grunts)

1714
01:35:20,806 --> 01:35:23,109
Um... Shit, um...

1715
01:35:24,176 --> 01:35:26,212
I left my phone in the car.

1716
01:35:30,516 --> 01:35:31,484
(sighs)

1717
01:35:32,151 --> 01:35:33,252
Sorry.

1718
01:35:39,091 --> 01:35:42,295
(mellow music plays)

1719
01:35:48,067 --> 01:35:50,770
(crockery clattering)

1720
01:35:50,904 --> 01:35:53,205
Woman: Are you finished
with the phone, dear?

1721
01:35:56,242 --> 01:35:58,644
Uh... Yeah. Yeah, thank you.

1722
01:36:02,049 --> 01:36:03,549
Would you like some coffee?

1723
01:36:04,383 --> 01:36:05,718
Yes, please.

1724
01:36:06,652 --> 01:36:08,220
Woman: It's our special roast.

1725
01:36:08,989 --> 01:36:10,489
Night's still young.

1726
01:36:24,437 --> 01:36:26,739
You know,
if you would have just told me

1727
01:36:26,873 --> 01:36:28,207
you didn't have a car,

1728
01:36:29,542 --> 01:36:31,243
I could have picked you up.

1729
01:36:34,747 --> 01:36:35,849
(Mike chuckles)

1730
01:36:54,500 --> 01:36:56,937
Um... Brett said he's on the way

1731
01:36:57,070 --> 01:37:01,540
to come pick us up
and take us home... soon.

1732
01:37:03,609 --> 01:37:05,678
- Kelsey: Hm.
- Yeah.

1733
01:37:09,883 --> 01:37:12,385
But... it's Brett....

1734
01:37:13,954 --> 01:37:15,254
so...

1735
01:37:16,288 --> 01:37:17,757
He'll take forever.

1736
01:37:29,735 --> 01:37:31,704
- (horn honks)
- Brett: Mike.

1737
01:37:31,838 --> 01:37:33,739
- (horn honks)
- Mike, come on!

1738
01:37:33,874 --> 01:37:35,876
It's late,
you woke me up for this.

1739
01:37:36,009 --> 01:37:38,377
Mike, I broke 30 laws
just to get here for you.

1740
01:37:38,611 --> 01:37:41,048
You come out now.
I don't have all night.

1741
01:37:41,180 --> 01:37:43,884
You interrupted my REM cycle.

1742
01:37:44,483 --> 01:37:47,120
Bring me that coffee, right now.

1743
01:37:47,353 --> 01:37:48,521
Two sugars, Mike.

1744
01:37:48,654 --> 01:37:51,223
I need two sugars
in that coffee.

1745
01:37:51,357 --> 01:37:52,425
Mike.

1746
01:37:52,558 --> 01:37:54,226
Two sugars, Mike.

1747
01:37:54,393 --> 01:37:58,664
Hey, Mike! Mike! Mike!
Mike! Mike!

1748
01:37:59,398 --> 01:38:00,499
Mike!

1749
01:38:01,801 --> 01:38:02,601
Mike!

1750
01:38:02,735 --> 01:38:05,072
Stop, I've got a backseat.

1751
01:38:05,204 --> 01:38:07,440
Mike, get out here!

1752
01:38:07,573 --> 01:38:09,742
I hope you're thinking of me
while kissing her.

1753
01:38:10,242 --> 01:38:12,278
Kelsey, he's inexperienced.

1754
01:38:12,411 --> 01:38:14,580
Don't trust him, he doesn't know
what he's doing.

1755
01:38:15,082 --> 01:38:16,248
Mike!

1756
01:38:17,483 --> 01:38:19,218
Can I at least join?

1757
01:38:21,454 --> 01:38:24,124
Mike. Mike, I saw that smile.

1758
01:38:24,256 --> 01:38:26,126
You, me, Janice, Kelsey.

1759
01:38:26,258 --> 01:38:27,693
We've all had the thought, like.

1760
01:38:27,827 --> 01:38:30,830
I swear, Mike, Janice will be
a lot more into it.

1761
01:38:30,964 --> 01:38:32,665
Bro, there's pancakes.

1762
01:38:33,100 --> 01:38:35,035
Mike, give me the pancakes.

1763
01:38:35,501 --> 01:38:37,938
Mike, bro. Bro, turn around.

1764
01:38:38,071 --> 01:38:39,438
Get those pancakes for me.

1765
01:38:39,906 --> 01:38:42,575
I gotta get up in like two
hours.

1766
01:38:42,708 --> 01:38:43,609
Mike!

1767
01:38:44,276 --> 01:38:45,411
Mike, Mike!

1768
01:38:46,679 --> 01:38:47,580
Mike!

1769
01:38:49,415 --> 01:38:50,516
Mike!

1770
01:38:51,350 --> 01:38:52,551
Mike!

1771

01:39:48,875 --> 01:39:50,409
Mike's Mom: <i>Quick, hurry.</i>

1774
01:39:50,543 --> 01:39:51,677
Mike's Dad:
<i>I'm gonna fill her up, okay?</i>

1775
01:39:51,811 --> 01:39:53,146
Oh, the only way
to do it, right?

1776
01:39:53,280 --> 01:39:54,814
We're not shy in this family.

1777
01:39:54,948 --> 01:39:56,315
Mike's Mom: Mm-hm.

1778
01:39:59,152 --> 01:40:00,553
Honey, should we call the house?

1779
01:40:00,686 --> 01:40:02,421
- Why?
- Just to check in...

1780
01:40:02,555 --> 01:40:03,522
Whoa, no, no, no.
No, no, no.

1781
01:40:03,656 --> 01:40:04,824
- It's fine.
- What?

1782
01:40:04,958 --> 01:40:06,026
He's fine.

1783
01:40:06,625 --> 01:40:08,028
I hope no one has their feet on
my coffee table, I know that.

1784
01:40:08,161 --> 01:40:11,397
Mm. Sweetheart, relax.
It's Michael.

1785
01:40:12,398 --> 01:40:14,567
(laughing)

1786
01:40:14,700 --> 01:40:16,368
What could possibly
be going wrong?

1787
01:40:16,502 --> 01:40:18,504
