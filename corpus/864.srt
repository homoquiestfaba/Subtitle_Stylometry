1
00:01:59,757 --> 00:02:02,021
Q-U...

2
00:02:02,192 --> 00:02:04,183
...A- R...

3
00:02:06,864 --> 00:02:09,094
...A- N-T...

4
00:02:11,235 --> 00:02:13,795
...l- N-E.

5
00:02:17,274 --> 00:02:19,640
Quarantine.

6
00:02:20,277 --> 00:02:23,303
Q-U-A-R...

7
00:02:26,383 --> 00:02:28,851
...A- N-T...

8
00:02:29,586 --> 00:02:32,077
...l- N-E.

9
00:02:32,656 --> 00:02:34,248
Quarantine.

10
00:02:34,458 --> 00:02:36,016
You know the cholera?

11
00:02:36,193 --> 00:02:37,717
Yes, Mother.

12
00:02:37,895 --> 00:02:40,830
You've seen the signs on
the houses where the coloreds live?

13
00:02:40,998 --> 00:02:42,659
Yes, Mother.

14
00:02:42,833 --> 00:02:44,095
You know the typhus?

15
00:02:44,268 --> 00:02:46,327
I do, Mother.

16
00:02:49,239 --> 00:02:51,264
You know what they
can do to you?

17
00:02:52,109 --> 00:02:53,667
Yes, Mother.

18
00:02:57,614 --> 00:02:59,980
You are not safe.

19
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:10,585
You may be directing this movie,
but what you're asking, we can't do.

20
00:03:11,929 --> 00:03:13,624
Don't tell me it can't be done.

21
00:03:13,797 --> 00:03:17,563
The gyro forces are too much.
You send these planes into barrel rolls...

22
00:03:17,734 --> 00:03:21,226
...they won't make it.
- It's the climax of the picture. Make it work.

23
00:03:21,405 --> 00:03:23,896
Decrease the vertical trajectory
if you have to.

24
00:03:24,074 --> 00:03:26,565
A Le Rhône rotary
won't stall at 60 degrees.

25
00:03:26,743 --> 00:03:30,304
We're still short two cameras.
We need to cut that sequence down...

26
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,881
We're not cutting. I'll get those cameras.
Set up for rehearsals.

27
00:03:34,051 --> 00:03:36,849
I'm Noah Dietrich.
Your office said I'd find you here.

28
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:39,113
Dietrich.
You're a man on the come.

29
00:03:39,289 --> 00:03:43,123
I read your résumé, talked to your references.
Know what I'm looking for?

30
00:03:43,293 --> 00:03:46,319
You're looking for a second-in-command
at Hughes Tools.

31
00:03:46,496 --> 00:03:49,260
Someone to oversee
the financial aspects of the business.

32
00:03:49,433 --> 00:03:52,197
I'm looking for somebody to run it
and do a good job.

33
00:03:52,369 --> 00:03:54,633
There's only one thing
you've gotta know.

34
00:03:54,805 --> 00:03:57,638
My folks, they're gone now.
So it's my money.

35
00:03:57,808 --> 00:04:01,539
What I do with that money may seem crazy
to those sons of bitches in Houston.

36
00:04:01,712 --> 00:04:05,273
I'm sure it does, but it all makes
good sense to me. You got that?

37
00:04:05,449 --> 00:04:07,246
- Got it.
- Good.

38
00:04:07,417 --> 00:04:10,545
Now, you made, what,
$5200 a year at your last job?

39
00:04:10,721 --> 00:04:14,589
- I'll pay you $ 10,000.
- I guess I'll be working twice as hard.

40
00:04:14,758 --> 00:04:18,319
You'll be working four times as hard.
I just got you at half price.

41
00:04:18,495 --> 00:04:19,985
- Welcome aboard.
- Thank you.

42
00:04:20,163 --> 00:04:22,324
You're my voice now.
Make them understand that.

43
00:04:22,499 --> 00:04:26,663
Some of those folks still call me Junior.
You tell them it's "Mr. Hughes" now.

44
00:04:26,837 --> 00:04:28,930
You bet.
So when do we go to Houston?

45
00:04:29,106 --> 00:04:32,371
We don't. Cholera epidemic in 1913.
Two thousand dead.

46
00:04:32,542 --> 00:04:34,601
Whole place is nothing but
pestilential swamp.

47
00:04:34,778 --> 00:04:38,874
Typhus, malaria, cholera, yellow fever.
You name it, they got it.

48
00:04:39,049 --> 00:04:40,516
You see that, Mr. Dietrich?

49
00:04:41,518 --> 00:04:45,579
You are looking at the largest
private air force in the entire world.

50
00:04:45,756 --> 00:04:47,781
What do you think of that, now?

51
00:04:49,192 --> 00:04:50,750
It's your money.

52
00:04:50,928 --> 00:04:53,328
Start them up!

53
00:06:19,282 --> 00:06:23,116
<i>I saw the rough cut of the new
Tod Browning movie, London After Midnight.</i>

54
00:06:23,286 --> 00:06:25,083
Lon Chaney is incredible.

55
00:06:25,255 --> 00:06:27,587
It's his best performance
in a long time.

56
00:06:27,758 --> 00:06:30,090
It's gonna be a big hit.
The cards are great.

57
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:31,693
It's supposed to be...

58
00:06:31,862 --> 00:06:34,296
Hello, Mr. Mayer.

59
00:06:34,464 --> 00:06:37,456
I don't know if you remember me.
My name's Howard Hughes.

60
00:06:37,634 --> 00:06:40,000
I was wondering
if I could have a moment.

61
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:43,230
- Oh, Howard Hughes. The airplane picture?
- Exactly.

62
00:06:43,407 --> 00:06:45,739
<i>- I remember.
- Hell's Angels. You heard of it.</i>

63
00:06:45,909 --> 00:06:47,137
- Good.
- Yes.

64
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:50,108
I was wondering if I could
have a moment of your time.

65
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,577
I need a few cameras.

66
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:55,408
- Yeah?
- Yeah, two, to be exact.

67
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:00,346
I bought every camera I could find.
We're shooting our big dogfight sequence.

68
00:07:00,524 --> 00:07:03,960
I need two more. Desperately.
You think MGM could help me out?

69
00:07:04,261 --> 00:07:05,489
With what?

70
00:07:05,662 --> 00:07:08,460
- Cameras.
- Oh, with the actual cam...

71
00:07:08,632 --> 00:07:11,829
We're not usually in the practice
of helping out competition.

72
00:07:12,102 --> 00:07:15,128
- No. No.
- So how many cameras do you have now?

73
00:07:15,305 --> 00:07:16,670
Twenty-four.

74
00:07:19,242 --> 00:07:21,836
You...?
Wait a minute.

75
00:07:24,114 --> 00:07:25,979
- You have 24 cameras?
- That's right.

76
00:07:26,149 --> 00:07:28,743
- And you need...? You need two more?
- Yeah.

77
00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:32,514
- You don't think you got it with 24?
- No. No, sir.

78
00:07:32,689 --> 00:07:35,317
You know, I think...
I think we've got them all...

79
00:07:35,492 --> 00:07:37,926
Don't we have them...?
They're all used, right?

80
00:07:38,095 --> 00:07:40,359
- All 26 of them.
- I only need two, sir.

81
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:42,395
- Jesus Christ, sonny.
- Howard.

82
00:07:42,566 --> 00:07:45,228
Howard. Let me give you
a little advice, huh?

83
00:07:45,402 --> 00:07:47,495
- Take your oil money...
- Drill bits.

84
00:07:47,671 --> 00:07:50,765
All right, take your drill-bit money
and put it in the bank.

85
00:07:50,941 --> 00:07:53,603
If you continue making
the movie the way you are...

86
00:07:53,777 --> 00:07:56,041
...there isn't gonna be a distributor...

87
00:07:56,213 --> 00:07:59,182
...you won't find anybody
who wants to see the movie...

88
00:07:59,349 --> 00:08:02,011
...and you're not gonna have
any more oil money.

89
00:08:02,185 --> 00:08:05,211
So welcome to Hollywood.

90
00:08:05,388 --> 00:08:08,789
Yeah. Well, I'll be sure
to remember that, Mr. Mayer.

91
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:10,756
- Good luck.
- All right.

92
00:08:10,927 --> 00:08:14,124
He needs 26 to make it work?
He's out of his mind.

93
00:08:21,371 --> 00:08:24,204
I looked down at my pants.
It was a strange situation.

94
00:08:26,042 --> 00:08:28,772
Boss.
Scram, love boat, let's go.

95
00:08:30,013 --> 00:08:33,039
- Another soda. You know what I mean.
- Milk. In the bottle.

96
00:08:33,216 --> 00:08:36,185
- With the cap still on.
- Okay, what did His Highness say?

97
00:08:36,353 --> 00:08:39,550
Son of a bitch won't part with
a single goddamn camera.

98
00:08:39,723 --> 00:08:42,248
Why don't you try and
make do with what you have.

99
00:08:42,826 --> 00:08:45,590
What I have isn't enough, John,
not for how I see it.

100
00:08:45,762 --> 00:08:47,252
Look.

101
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:51,366
My name depends on this picture.
If it doesn't work, I'm back to Houston...

102
00:08:51,535 --> 00:08:54,333
...making goddamn drill bits
for the rest of my life.

103
00:08:54,504 --> 00:08:56,665
Can't you do it
with the cameras you have?

104
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:59,604
You ought to hear about
what's going on with DeMille.

105
00:08:59,776 --> 00:09:04,042
He's shooting his Bible picture.
He's gotta do a crucifixion in Fresno.

106
00:09:04,214 --> 00:09:05,442
Johnny.

107
00:09:05,615 --> 00:09:07,708
- A bunch of tractors...
- Johnny.

108
00:09:07,884 --> 00:09:10,045
- You're a press agent, are you not?
- Yeah.

109
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:12,347
You're supposed to know
the ins and outs?

110
00:09:12,522 --> 00:09:13,750
- Absolutely.
- Do you?

111
00:09:13,924 --> 00:09:15,152
Yeah, absolutely.

112
00:09:15,325 --> 00:09:17,384
Then you leave the big ideas...

113
00:09:18,028 --> 00:09:20,121
...to me.
- Oh, yeah. Of course, boss.

114
00:09:20,297 --> 00:09:22,060
Cigar, cigarettes, Sen-Sen?

115
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,361
I thought you were
at the Brown Derby...

116
00:09:25,535 --> 00:09:27,264
...with Trixie. No, Theresa.

117
00:09:27,437 --> 00:09:28,961
- Margaret.
- Margaret. Exactly.

118
00:09:29,139 --> 00:09:31,266
What happened to Margaret?
She lost her...

119
00:09:31,441 --> 00:09:32,965
Thank God that's settled.

120
00:09:33,143 --> 00:09:36,271
Oh, I'm sorry.
Thelma, this is Howard Hughes.

121
00:09:36,446 --> 00:09:40,439
Howard and I were discussing how he
wants me to pull a camera out of my ass.

122
00:09:41,284 --> 00:09:45,084
- Cigarette?
- Oh, no, thanks. I don't smoke.

123
00:09:47,924 --> 00:09:51,223
Boy, you are just hitting
on all six cylinders, aren't you?

124
00:09:51,394 --> 00:09:53,259
My God.

125
00:09:53,863 --> 00:09:56,058
Would you do me
a favor and just...?

126
00:09:56,233 --> 00:09:58,895
Would you just smile
for me one time? Just once?

127
00:10:02,172 --> 00:10:04,800
Yeah. Yeah. You see,
you got a short upper lip.

128
00:10:05,175 --> 00:10:06,972
Makes for a much nicer smile.

129
00:10:12,148 --> 00:10:15,743
See, I wonder what gives
a beautiful woman like you pleasure.

130
00:10:15,986 --> 00:10:19,581
I mean, say you're just standing
there, right? And I just touch you.

131
00:10:19,756 --> 00:10:21,747
Just... Just like this.

132
00:10:22,359 --> 00:10:23,724
With my fingertips.

133
00:10:23,893 --> 00:10:26,123
Do you...?
Do you like that?

134
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:28,822
Do you?

135
00:10:33,837 --> 00:10:36,863
You see, I wanna learn
what pleases you.

136
00:10:38,074 --> 00:10:41,134
I wanna learn everything about you.

137
00:10:41,311 --> 00:10:43,336
Would you let me do that?

138
00:10:43,513 --> 00:10:45,708
Would you give me that job?

139
00:10:50,854 --> 00:10:52,822
I'm off in a half an hour.

140
00:10:54,524 --> 00:10:57,254
- Well, I'm in room...
- 217.

141
00:10:57,427 --> 00:10:59,361
217.

142
00:11:01,364 --> 00:11:03,229
See you there.

143
00:11:07,537 --> 00:11:10,062
Johnny, get on the horn
to Universal and Warners.

144
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,105
I need two more cameras
by Saturday.

145
00:11:12,275 --> 00:11:15,039
Rent them if you can.
Steal them if you have to.

146
00:11:15,779 --> 00:11:17,872
Absotively, boss.

147
00:11:18,348 --> 00:11:19,576
Absotively.

148
00:11:21,251 --> 00:11:24,015
<i>Rumors coming from a lonely airstrip
out in Van Nuys.</i>

149
00:11:24,187 --> 00:11:27,486
<i>Sources whisper that young
Texas industrialist Howard Hughes...</i>

150
00:11:27,657 --> 00:11:30,057
<i>... won't stop pouring money
into his war epic.</i>

151
00:11:30,226 --> 00:11:31,625
<i>And do we mean epic!</i>

152
00:11:31,795 --> 00:11:34,628
<i>One hundred and thirty-seven pilots.
87 airplanes...</i>

153
00:11:34,798 --> 00:11:39,201
<i>... 35 cameramen. 2000 extras.
How long will it be before this picture...</i>

154
00:11:39,369 --> 00:11:41,599
<i>... ends up costing as
much as the real war?</i>

155
00:11:41,771 --> 00:11:44,001
Damn it.
Why the hell do they look so slow?

156
00:11:44,174 --> 00:11:47,769
This isn't what it was like up there.
They look like goddamn models!

157
00:11:56,152 --> 00:11:57,585
Son of a bitch.

158
00:11:58,888 --> 00:12:00,287
Howard?

159
00:12:02,859 --> 00:12:06,761
Without something standing
still behind the planes...

160
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:09,490
...we've got no idea
of how fast we're moving.

161
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:12,499
We got no sense of relative motion.

162
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:16,332
Call UCLA.
Get me the best meteorologist they got.

163
00:12:16,506 --> 00:12:18,599
You get him here in an hour, all right?

164
00:12:21,978 --> 00:12:24,776
Hey. You want the good news
or the bad news?

165
00:12:24,948 --> 00:12:26,506
- Bad news, always.
- All right.

166
00:12:26,683 --> 00:12:29,880
We installed the 450 radial.
Struts won't take the vibration.

167
00:12:30,053 --> 00:12:33,853
Minute we fire her up, the struts
start cracking at the attach points.

168
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:36,820
- Well, what's the good news?
- There isn't any.

169
00:12:37,227 --> 00:12:40,822
Goddamn it, Odie. If the 450's too big,
we figure something else out.

170
00:12:40,997 --> 00:12:43,966
We've done everything.
We've rebuilt her from top to toe.

171
00:12:44,134 --> 00:12:45,931
If we drain the fuel tank...

172
00:12:46,102 --> 00:12:49,765
...she might make 180 miles per hour.
- I want minimum 200, all right?

173
00:12:49,939 --> 00:12:52,806
I want a date with Theda Bara.
That ain't gonna happen.

174
00:12:52,976 --> 00:12:54,876
Oh, don't be so sure.

175
00:12:55,245 --> 00:12:59,113
If the struts won't sustain the engine
we need, we gotta get rid of the struts.

176
00:12:59,282 --> 00:13:01,341
No, then the top wing falls off.

177
00:13:04,053 --> 00:13:05,611
Then let it.

178
00:13:06,122 --> 00:13:07,589
What?

179
00:13:08,892 --> 00:13:10,917
Who says we need a top wing?

180
00:13:11,094 --> 00:13:13,153
I mean, who says we need anything?

181
00:13:15,331 --> 00:13:17,765
- A monoplane.
- A cantilevered monoplane, right?

182
00:13:17,934 --> 00:13:21,131
They're doing it in France.
To hell with the top wing and struts.

183
00:13:21,304 --> 00:13:23,704
- A 550 Wasp engine.
- One-hundred-octane fuel.

184
00:13:23,873 --> 00:13:27,172
- That would give us a horsepower of what?
- Seven hundred.

185
00:13:28,711 --> 00:13:32,841
We squeeze that to a thousand,
we got the fastest plane ever built.

186
00:13:35,652 --> 00:13:37,176
You know, I've gotta say...

187
00:13:37,353 --> 00:13:41,050
...we've already spent over $200,000
rebuilding this plane.

188
00:13:42,492 --> 00:13:44,084
To hell with it.

189
00:13:45,228 --> 00:13:46,593
Tear it up, Odie.

190
00:13:46,763 --> 00:13:48,128
Go on.

191
00:13:51,801 --> 00:13:53,132
Well...

192
00:13:56,072 --> 00:13:59,769
The cumulonimbus formations
about which you speak...

193
00:14:01,244 --> 00:14:03,371
...that look like...

194
00:14:03,546 --> 00:14:05,343
Giant breasts full of milk.

195
00:14:05,515 --> 00:14:07,244
I want clouds, damn it.

196
00:14:07,617 --> 00:14:09,209
Yes, clouds...

197
00:14:09,385 --> 00:14:13,185
...that look like
giant breasts full of milk...

198
00:14:13,356 --> 00:14:16,883
...cannot exactly be guaranteed
for any particular occasion.

199
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:19,153
So you might have to...

200
00:14:20,463 --> 00:14:21,828
To wait.

201
00:14:23,933 --> 00:14:25,867
Then we'll wait.

202
00:14:26,836 --> 00:14:29,168
Look, whatever they pay
you at UCLA...

203
00:14:29,339 --> 00:14:32,934
...I'm doubling it, all right?
You work for me now. Find some clouds.

204
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:35,775
Find some clouds.

205
00:14:36,446 --> 00:14:38,209
Find me some clouds!

206
00:14:38,381 --> 00:14:40,576
<i>Welcome to Hell's Angels.</i>

207
00:14:43,786 --> 00:14:45,014
Thank you.

208
00:14:53,663 --> 00:14:57,121
I've been to Chatsworth,
Santa Cruz, Encino, San Diego...

209
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:01,168
...Riverside, Van Nuys and Bakersfield.
It has been eight months!

210
00:15:01,337 --> 00:15:03,134
Where are my goddamn clouds, huh?

211
00:15:03,306 --> 00:15:05,638
They move, Mr. Hughes!

212
00:15:05,808 --> 00:15:07,139
Clouds move.

213
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:09,778
- That's what they do. They move!
- You see that?

214
00:15:09,946 --> 00:15:13,643
It is costing me $5271 a day...

215
00:15:13,816 --> 00:15:18,219
...to keep those planes on the ground.
You find me some goddamn clouds, huh?

216
00:15:25,662 --> 00:15:27,152
Nice day.

217
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:29,530
Yeah, very funny.

218
00:15:29,799 --> 00:15:32,632
I got a call from Houston.
They're getting nervous.

219
00:15:32,802 --> 00:15:34,736
Stop showing them the damn bills.

220
00:15:34,904 --> 00:15:36,269
That would be illegal.

221
00:15:36,439 --> 00:15:38,669
Shit, no.
Maybe it's a little bit naughty.

222
00:15:38,841 --> 00:15:42,709
Hughes Tool is incorporated in Texas.
They have to see the bills.

223
00:15:44,113 --> 00:15:47,674
Incorporate a new division out here.
We'll call it Hughes Aircraft.

224
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:52,412
- Do we need these rivets on the cowling?
- Yeah, or the reverse thrust would rip it off.

225
00:15:52,589 --> 00:15:55,285
They're gonna give me drag.
Do something about that.

226
00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:57,722
- Wind resistance on rivets?
- I want her slippery.

227
00:15:57,894 --> 00:16:00,920
There are tax consequences
to incorporating in California.

228
00:16:01,097 --> 00:16:03,565
- Just take care of it, would you?
- Mr. Hughes!

229
00:16:03,733 --> 00:16:05,530
Oakland!

230
00:16:05,702 --> 00:16:08,728
- We have clouds in Oakland!
- You mean it this time?

231
00:16:08,905 --> 00:16:10,463
Yes!

232
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:13,734
Goddamn it, yes.
I can promise you.

233
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:17,175
- Clouds in Oakland.
- All right, don't get all jittery now.

234
00:16:17,347 --> 00:16:18,746
Oakland!

235
00:16:19,649 --> 00:16:21,514
Oakland!

236
00:16:21,684 --> 00:16:24,915
We're going to Oakland!
Oakland.

237
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:03,718
Down and to the left!

238
00:17:26,716 --> 00:17:28,707
That's perfect!

239
00:17:32,588 --> 00:17:36,991
That's right, Senator George.

240
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,856
<i>Yes. Young Howard Hughes
has pulled it off!</i>

241
00:17:40,029 --> 00:17:43,430
<i>After two years. Hell's Angels
has finally finished filming.</i>

242
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:46,727
<i>There's gonna be one heck
of a wrap party in Hollywood tonight.</i>

243
00:17:46,903 --> 00:17:49,599
<i>The price tag?
A staggering $ 2 million.</i>

244
00:17:49,772 --> 00:17:52,263
<i>If every human being
in America buys a ticket...</i>

245
00:17:52,442 --> 00:17:54,171
<i>... he might even make a profit.</i>

246
00:17:59,282 --> 00:18:00,613
First, clouds don't come.

247
00:18:00,783 --> 00:18:03,183
Then planes break down.
Then the planes crash.

248
00:18:04,854 --> 00:18:07,914
We've had everything but
a plague of locusts on this thing.

249
00:18:08,091 --> 00:18:09,456
I mean, you have to admit.

250
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:13,618
Now, honestly, did you ever think
you'd actually finish the damn thing?

251
00:18:15,832 --> 00:18:17,231
Come with me.

252
00:18:19,135 --> 00:18:22,400
<i>Mama. Darling.
If I'm a success in this show...</i>

253
00:18:22,572 --> 00:18:24,631
<i>- ... we're gonna move from here.
- Oh. No.</i>

254
00:18:24,807 --> 00:18:26,775
<i>Yes.
We're gonna move up in the Bronx.</i>

255
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:29,002
<i>Green grass.
A lot of people you know.</i>

256
00:18:29,178 --> 00:18:31,874
<i>The Ginsbergs.
The Guttenbergs and the Goldbergs.</i>

257
00:18:32,048 --> 00:18:34,744
<i>Oh. A whole lot of "bergs."
I don't know them all.</i>

258
00:18:35,351 --> 00:18:39,117
See, this is what the people want.
Silent pictures are yesterday's news.

259
00:18:39,288 --> 00:18:42,280
<i>So I figure we gotta reshoot
Hell's Angels for sound.</i>

260
00:18:44,694 --> 00:18:46,218
How much of it?

261
00:18:46,395 --> 00:18:48,659
All of it.
Before you ask, I'll tell you.

262
00:18:48,831 --> 00:18:51,698
An additional 1.7 million.
We got that much?

263
00:18:52,835 --> 00:18:56,100
- No!
- Well, we'll make it.

264
00:18:56,272 --> 00:18:58,001
Take care of that, would you?

265
00:18:58,174 --> 00:18:59,505
<i>Now. Get this.</i>

266
00:19:09,585 --> 00:19:11,746
<i>In the halls of 7000 Romaine...</i>

267
00:19:11,921 --> 00:19:14,355
<i>... it goes on day after day.
Month after month.</i>

268
00:19:14,524 --> 00:19:18,221
<i>Howard Hughes is now editing
some 25 miles of film.</i>

269
00:19:19,629 --> 00:19:24,225
<i>Heck. I say release it now and give
the world its first 560-hour movie.</i>

270
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,666
Pat, Mr. Hughes needs this reel
in the projection room right now!

271
00:19:29,539 --> 00:19:31,131
<i>Enough is enough. Mr. Hughes.</i>

272
00:19:31,307 --> 00:19:34,504
<i>Are you ever gonna let us
actually see this epic of yours?</i>

273
00:19:34,677 --> 00:19:36,167
Hurry up!

274
00:19:57,166 --> 00:19:58,565
- Who is it?
- Noah.

275
00:19:58,734 --> 00:20:00,395
Come on in.

276
00:20:01,971 --> 00:20:04,565
I've been on the phone
to Houston for three hours.

277
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:07,732
- We're fixing every goddamn book we have.
- Wait, wait.

278
00:20:08,678 --> 00:20:12,079
Yeah. Run reel 10 again.
I think we're duplicating a shot here.

279
00:20:12,248 --> 00:20:16,082
And tell Jimmy I want
10 chocolate chip cookies, all right?

280
00:20:16,252 --> 00:20:19,119
Medium chips,
none too close to the outside.

281
00:20:19,288 --> 00:20:20,778
Got it?

282
00:20:20,957 --> 00:20:23,289
You remember
that goddamn shot from reel 10?

283
00:20:23,459 --> 00:20:26,053
No. I don't remember
anything from reel 10.

284
00:20:26,229 --> 00:20:28,390
I don't know what reel 10 is.

285
00:20:28,564 --> 00:20:31,829
I'm a businessman, Howard.
And so are you.

286
00:20:32,001 --> 00:20:33,798
Now, look.

287
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:35,437
This has been a great ride.

288
00:20:35,605 --> 00:20:37,539
We've had a hell of a lot of fun.

289
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:41,603
But you're losing
$25,000 a day doing this.

290
00:20:41,911 --> 00:20:43,811
Every day.

291
00:20:49,385 --> 00:20:52,218
So, what are my options?

292
00:20:53,789 --> 00:20:56,519
Well, this time I don't know
that you have any.

293
00:20:56,692 --> 00:20:59,126
I'm afraid you gotta close it down.

294
00:20:59,896 --> 00:21:01,488
Dig your way out.

295
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:10,161
I'm sorry, Howard.

296
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:12,537
I truly am.

297
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:21,508
<i>Reel 10. Mr. Hughes.</i>

298
00:21:27,556 --> 00:21:29,581
Mortgage Tool Co.

299
00:21:30,493 --> 00:21:35,590
- Every asset. You heard me.
- Lf you do that, you could lose everything.

300
00:21:35,765 --> 00:21:37,323
Well, I won't.

301
00:21:40,469 --> 00:21:41,936
I won't.

302
00:21:43,406 --> 00:21:45,203
All right.

303
00:21:46,409 --> 00:21:48,036
I'll get into it.

304
00:21:49,412 --> 00:21:50,970
Thanks, Noah.

305
00:22:26,082 --> 00:22:29,813
<i>More than half a million souls lining
the curb of Hollywood Boulevard.</i>

306
00:22:29,986 --> 00:22:31,613
<i>Look at the automobiles!</i>

307
00:22:31,787 --> 00:22:35,655
<i>There are 45.000 cars here.
Making it the greatest traffic jam ever seen.</i>

308
00:22:35,825 --> 00:22:38,225
<i>Howard Hughes must have
a lump in his throat.</i>

309

<i>Six months after the stock market crashes
and after three pilots' deaths...</i>

310
00:22:42,665 --> 00:22:45,634
<i>... he's finally unveiling his
$4 million baby doll.</i>

311
00:22:45,801 --> 00:22:50,101
<i>It's the most expensive movie ever made.
Nothing five-and-dime for our Mr. Hughes.</i>

312
00:22:50,272 --> 00:22:53,571
<i>Nothing like tonight has ever been
seen before. And I can say...</i>

313
00:22:53,743 --> 00:22:55,404
<i>... it will never be seen again.</i>

314
00:22:55,578 --> 00:22:59,571
<i>Five hundred thousand people are crowding
the streets to get a glimpse of the stars.</i>

315

<i>This is an industry town.</i>

320

00:23:16,298 --> 00:23:19,131
<i>Yes. Yes. I can see

<i>Mr. Hughes escorts
the lovely starlet Jean Harlow.</i>

<i>He discovered her for this picture.
And we think her platinum blond locks...</i>

324

<i>... and hot-jazz. Baby-doll style
are gonna make her a big star.</i>

Howard! Howard!

326
00:23:48,664 --> 00:23:50,529
Over here!

327
00:23:57,106 --> 00:24:01,338
- This way, boss. Right over there.
- Mr. Hughes, how about a word?

328
00:24:01,544 --> 00:24:04,012
Big night for you, Mr. Hughes.

329
00:24:05,948 --> 00:24:08,576
Big night for you tonight.

330
00:24:08,751 --> 00:24:11,083
Very big. Very big.

331
00:24:11,253 --> 00:24:14,950
Tell us what it was like
making this fabulous picture.

332
00:24:16,792 --> 00:24:18,555
Yes.

333
00:24:18,727 --> 00:24:20,126
Yeah.

334
00:24:20,296 --> 00:24:22,924
So 4 million clams
from your own pocket.

335
00:24:23,099 --> 00:24:24,726
Nervous how the flick will fly?

336
00:24:28,304 --> 00:24:31,603
Big night. You enjoy the show.

337
00:24:32,108 --> 00:24:37,478
<i>Yes, well, let me present the feminine
star of this spectacle, Hell's Angels...</i>

338
00:24:37,646 --> 00:24:40,240
...Miss Jean Harlow.
- Thank you.

339
00:24:40,416 --> 00:24:43,385
I would like to use this occasion
to thank Mr. Hughes...

340
00:24:43,552 --> 00:24:46,851
...for the opportunity he gave me.
Thank you.

341
00:24:47,022 --> 00:24:50,389
Thank you!
Now I'd like to ask Roscoe Arbuckle...

342
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:53,528
...to introduce
his pet lion cub, Gilmore.

343
00:24:53,696 --> 00:24:56,358
What's the matter with you?
Can't remember my name?

344
00:24:56,532 --> 00:25:00,525
I'm sorry. Roscoe Turner,
and this would be Gilmore.

345
00:25:43,646 --> 00:25:45,307
It's going! It's going!

346
00:25:46,982 --> 00:25:50,418
Murder! That's what this
dirty, rotten politician war is, murder!

347
00:25:50,586 --> 00:25:52,053
You know it as well as I do.

348
00:26:29,825 --> 00:26:31,417
Stand up, slim, take a bow.

349
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:47,270
Reel four played too long.
Too many coughs.

350
00:26:47,443 --> 00:26:51,402
Get the team out of the party and
to the office. I wanna cut a few shots.

351
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:53,810
Oh, find Glenn.
Somebody write this down.

352
00:26:53,983 --> 00:26:55,211
Flush rivets.
Got that?

353
00:26:55,384 --> 00:26:57,079
- Flush rivets.
- Flush rivets.

354
00:26:57,253 --> 00:26:58,777
Lickety-split, boss.

355
00:26:59,021 --> 00:27:00,648
Here he is! Here he is!

356
00:27:02,725 --> 00:27:04,625
<i>Variety says. "This one won't miss!"</i>

357
00:27:04,793 --> 00:27:08,058
<i>- Magnificently photographed!
- Awesome beyond description!</i>

358
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:11,825
<i>The most extraordinary output
to emerge from a motion-picture studio.</i>

359
00:27:12,001 --> 00:27:14,936
<i>Not for a long time have I seen
anything as enthralling.</i>

360
00:27:15,104 --> 00:27:18,130
<i>It costs 4 million dollars
and has 4 million thrills!</i>

361
00:27:18,307 --> 00:27:20,605
<i>- Majestically...
- Most epic picture of its time!</i>

362
00:28:16,065 --> 00:28:19,034
A lighter shade. I don't want
to look like Boris Karloff.

363
00:28:19,201 --> 00:28:20,793
If you know what I mean.

364
00:28:22,738 --> 00:28:26,674
I read in the magazines
that you play golf.

365
00:28:26,842 --> 00:28:28,503
On occasion.

366
00:28:28,677 --> 00:28:30,907
Well, how about nine holes?

367
00:28:33,015 --> 00:28:35,176
Now, Mr. Hughes?

368
00:28:35,851 --> 00:28:38,581
If it would be convenient, Miss Hepburn.

369
00:29:01,143 --> 00:29:04,601
You're not extending
enough on your follow-through.

370
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:07,715
Follow-through
is everything in golf, just like life.

371
00:29:07,883 --> 00:29:09,180
Don't you find?

372
00:29:09,351 --> 00:29:11,376
<i>Saw your Scarface picture.</i>

373
00:29:11,553 --> 00:29:12,850
- Violent.
- Realistic.

374
00:29:13,021 --> 00:29:15,353
Movies are movies, Howard.
Not life.

375
00:29:15,524 --> 00:29:17,219
Now the stage.

376
00:29:17,393 --> 00:29:18,621
The stage is real.

377
00:29:18,794 --> 00:29:22,787
Real flesh and blood. Human beings
right out there in front of you, buster.

378
00:29:22,965 --> 00:29:25,934
Can't look away. Can't munch popcorn.
That would be rude.

379
00:29:26,101 --> 00:29:27,363
Do you like the theater?

380
00:29:27,669 --> 00:29:30,160
- No.
- Oh, I adore the theater.

381
00:29:30,339 --> 00:29:32,500
Only alive on-stage.
I'll teach you.

382
00:29:32,674 --> 00:29:36,610
We'll see some Ibsen. If the Republicans
haven't outlawed him by now.

383
00:29:36,779 --> 00:29:39,805
You're not a Republican, are you?
How did you vote in '32?

384
00:29:39,982 --> 00:29:43,440
- Well, I didn't.
- You must! It's your sacred franchise.

385
00:29:47,322 --> 00:29:50,086
Heard you were wooing Ginger Rogers.
What about that?

386
00:29:50,259 --> 00:29:52,591
She's just a friend.

387
00:29:52,761 --> 00:29:54,456
Men can't be friends with women.

388
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:56,689
They must possess them
or leave them be.

389
00:29:56,865 --> 00:29:59,993
It's a primitive urge from caveman days.
It's all in Darwin.

390
00:30:00,169 --> 00:30:05,505
Hunt the flesh, kill the flesh, eat the flesh.
That's the male sex all over.

391
00:30:06,175 --> 00:30:07,540
Excuse me?

392
00:30:08,343 --> 00:30:11,335
Well, if you're deaf,
you must own up to it.

393
00:30:11,613 --> 00:30:13,547
Get a hearing aid.
Or see my father.

394
00:30:13,715 --> 00:30:17,378
He's a urologist, but it's all tied up
inside the body, don't you find?

395
00:30:17,719 --> 00:30:19,186
Me, I keep healthy.

396
00:30:19,354 --> 00:30:21,481
I take seven showers a day
to keep clean.

397
00:30:21,657 --> 00:30:24,990
Also because I am what's so
vulgarly referred to as "outdoorsy."

398
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:29,153
I'm not outdoorsy.
I'm athletic. I sweat.

399
00:30:29,331 --> 00:30:32,095
There it is.
Now we both know the sordid truth.

400
00:30:32,267 --> 00:30:34,735
I sweat and you're deaf.

401
00:30:34,903 --> 00:30:37,770
Aren't we a fine pair of misfits?

402
00:30:41,343 --> 00:30:43,208
Three.

403
00:30:50,752 --> 00:30:52,583
Noble effort.

404
00:30:54,957 --> 00:30:57,653
So I suppose you're
wooing me now?

405
00:30:58,327 --> 00:31:00,318
Oh, well.

406
00:31:19,381 --> 00:31:20,871
Not enough.

407
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:24,476
Not enough.
These rivets have to be completely flush.

408
00:31:24,653 --> 00:31:27,554
I want every screw and joint countersunk.

409
00:31:27,789 --> 00:31:30,587
I want no wind resistance
on the fuselage.

410
00:31:30,759 --> 00:31:33,057
She has got to be clean, Odie.

411
00:31:33,228 --> 00:31:34,991
- Clean. Understand?
- Okay, Howard.

412
00:31:35,163 --> 00:31:36,960
I don't know
what else to tell you.

413
00:31:38,033 --> 00:31:41,594
- What do you got for me?
- The thing is, TWA needs a new plane.

414
00:31:41,770 --> 00:31:44,398
- A modern plane.
- Oh, yeah? What kind of plane?

415
00:31:44,573 --> 00:31:46,803
Okay. The DC-3 has 21 daytime seats...

416
00:31:46,975 --> 00:31:49,409
...and 14 overnight berths.
- Something bigger?

417
00:31:50,746 --> 00:31:53,112
Try 50 seats with
a ceiling of 12,000 feet.

418
00:31:53,282 --> 00:31:55,512
No. No, 20,000.

419
00:31:55,884 --> 00:31:58,011
Think about it.
What does 20,000 feet give you?

420
00:31:58,186 --> 00:32:00,780
- Less turbulence.
- Because it's above the weather.

421
00:32:00,956 --> 00:32:03,322
Jack, we wanna fly
above the weather.

422
00:32:03,492 --> 00:32:07,053
Only 1 percent of the American population
has set foot on an airliner.

423
00:32:07,229 --> 00:32:09,993
Why? Because they're scared to death.
They should be.

424
00:32:10,165 --> 00:32:12,759
I mean, 7000 feet is bumpy as shit.
You know that.

425
00:32:12,935 --> 00:32:15,426
We build a plane
that flies above the weather...

426
00:32:15,604 --> 00:32:19,370
...we could get every man, woman
and child in this country to feel safe.

427
00:32:19,541 --> 00:32:24,035
An airplane with the ability to fly into
the substratosphere across the country.

428
00:32:24,212 --> 00:32:26,043
Across the world.

429
00:32:26,214 --> 00:32:28,307
Now that is the future.

430
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:29,978
- You with me?
- Yeah.

431
00:32:30,152 --> 00:32:34,088
I don't wanna get into this
if your board doesn't have the balls for it.

432
00:32:34,256 --> 00:32:36,554
- Would they support us?
- I don't know.

433
00:32:36,725 --> 00:32:38,955
- What's your financial picture?
- Not great.

434
00:32:39,127 --> 00:32:41,288
- Last year's deficit?
- 770,000.

435
00:32:41,463 --> 00:32:44,159
- What's it selling at?
- About 8 dollars a share.

436
00:32:44,333 --> 00:32:46,062
That's the lowest it's been, huh?

437
00:32:48,036 --> 00:32:49,503
I could do that.

438
00:32:49,671 --> 00:32:51,161
- Do what?
- Buy it.

439
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:54,002
- You wanna buy the airline?
- For crying out loud...

440
00:32:54,176 --> 00:32:58,078
...we don't want pencil pushers getting
in the way of us making our plane.

441
00:32:58,246 --> 00:33:02,080
Give me brass tacks, now. What does
controlling interest in TWA cost me?

442
00:33:03,118 --> 00:33:04,517
Call it 15 million.

443
00:33:06,922 --> 00:33:09,083
That is a chunk of change, huh?

444
00:33:12,527 --> 00:33:14,358
You call Noah Dietrich.

445
00:33:14,529 --> 00:33:16,497
You have him start buying.

446
00:33:16,665 --> 00:33:17,927
Howard, hold on.

447
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:21,126
Are you sure?
You wanna think about it for five minutes?

448
00:33:21,303 --> 00:33:25,137
Hell, Jack, I got a tiger by the tail here.
I ain't gonna let it go.

449
00:33:33,949 --> 00:33:35,678
Good evening, Mr. Hughes.

450
00:33:35,851 --> 00:33:38,217
Welcome. Your table is ready.

451
00:33:39,388 --> 00:33:40,912
How goes the aviation?

452
00:33:41,089 --> 00:33:44,058
- Oh, just fine, Pete.
- I'm so glad.

453
00:33:46,395 --> 00:33:47,726
Good evening, Mr. Hughes.

454
00:33:47,896 --> 00:33:49,124
- Madame.
- It's "miss."

455
00:33:49,297 --> 00:33:51,731
Miss. The usual, Mr. Hughes?

456
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:54,027
- Please.
- May I recommend for the lady...

457
00:33:54,202 --> 00:33:57,694
...our clementine soup followed
by roast duck with currant glaze...

458
00:33:57,873 --> 00:34:00,842
...and poached pears in rose sauce.
It's truly divine.

459
00:34:01,009 --> 00:34:02,499
Yeah. That sounds fine.

460
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:07,410
Your kind of joint, is it?

461
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:10,108
Wouldn't have thought.

462
00:34:10,285 --> 00:34:13,482
They're open late.
I go to a hot-dog stand on La Cienega too.

463
00:34:13,655 --> 00:34:16,317
- They're open till about 4.
- Are they?

464
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:20,191
How marvelous.

465
00:34:36,044 --> 00:34:37,671
Howard! Howard!

466
00:34:38,647 --> 00:34:41,411
Hi! Son of a gun.

467
00:34:41,583 --> 00:34:45,417
Kate, this is Johnny Meyer.
I suppose you could call him my press agent.

468
00:34:45,587 --> 00:34:47,851
<i>- Pleased to meet you. Loved Alice Adams.
- You're too kind.</i>

469
00:34:48,023 --> 00:34:50,719
- I'm sure you know Errol, right?
- Mr. Flynn. Yes.

470
00:34:50,892 --> 00:34:55,761
Kate. Kate. Kate of the clenched-jawed
Hepburns. Enchanting as always.

471
00:34:55,931 --> 00:34:58,627
You should use Lux on your hands,
by the way. I do.

472
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,961
You and Howard
ought to cook up a picture.

473
00:35:01,136 --> 00:35:03,661
Costar with Errol.
I could sell that in spades.

474
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:06,034
That would be marvelous. Howard?

475
00:35:06,641 --> 00:35:10,372
<i>I think not.
Don't you read Variety, Mr. Meyer?</i>

476
00:35:10,545 --> 00:35:14,242
Well, I'm box-office poison.
I'm on the outs, the skids, the doldrums.

477
00:35:14,416 --> 00:35:17,783
Washed-up, day-old fish
not worth the eating, so they tell me.

478
00:35:17,953 --> 00:35:21,787
Hell with them. Hell with them, my dear.
Soulless pricks to a man, right?

479
00:35:21,957 --> 00:35:25,984
Johnny tells me you're thinking about
doing a Western, of all goddamn things.

480
00:35:30,065 --> 00:35:32,829
Are you making a Western, Howard?

481
00:35:33,034 --> 00:35:35,798
<i>Yeah. Making a Western.
I'm gonna call it The Outlaw.</i>

482
00:35:35,971 --> 00:35:38,132
Yeah. And you know
what it's about? S-E-X.

483
00:35:38,306 --> 00:35:41,002
- It's all about S-E-X.
- It's a Western.

484
00:35:41,176 --> 00:35:44,077
You can't have fornication in a Western.
It isn't done.

485
00:35:44,246 --> 00:35:46,043
It's not real sex, it's movie sex.

486
00:35:46,214 --> 00:35:49,877
<i>What Scarface did for the gangster picture,
The Outlaw will do for the Western.</i>

487
00:35:50,051 --> 00:35:52,918
Put the sex and guts and blood
up there on the screen.

488
00:35:53,088 --> 00:35:55,113
- Have you seen my cigarettes?
- Don't mind us.

489
00:35:55,290 --> 00:35:58,691
New York cut steak, 12 peas,
bottle of milk with the cap on.

490
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:02,091
- You can't afford your own cigarettes?
- Jack has all my money.

491
00:36:02,264 --> 00:36:06,564
I hope your food isn't getting cold
at your table somewhere or something.

492
00:36:06,735 --> 00:36:09,033
No, no. We're here all night.
Don't worry.

493
00:36:09,204 --> 00:36:14,733
Now, Howard. Now, Howard. If you're
seriously talking about putting carnality...

494
00:36:14,910 --> 00:36:19,574
...back on the silver screen, you must swear
to let me in on the casting session.

495
00:36:22,717 --> 00:36:27,586
- I have an eye for talent. Isn't that right?
- You ought to give up prancing in tights...

496
00:36:27,756 --> 00:36:31,351
...be a talent scout.
- That prancing paid for my new yacht.

497
00:36:31,526 --> 00:36:34,984
You must all come sailing with me.
Catalina. What do you say?

498
00:36:35,163 --> 00:36:38,326
- Catalina. Sounds grand. Yeah.
- I've even managed to coax...

499
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:42,368
...the luscious Miss De Havilland
and her equally luscious sister to come.

500
00:36:42,537 --> 00:36:47,406
Though I fear their mother will insist on
coming, to preserve their questionable virtue.

501
00:36:47,576 --> 00:36:51,774
We shall assault these twin monuments
of pristine Britannic beauty nonetheless.

502
00:36:51,947 --> 00:36:54,006
- What do you say, Howard?
- Yeah?

503
00:36:54,416 --> 00:36:56,577
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah?

504
00:37:00,889 --> 00:37:02,186
I gotta go.

505
00:37:03,058 --> 00:37:06,585
If you'll excuse us, we have...
We have to be somewhere.

506
00:37:06,928 --> 00:37:09,396
You are somewhere, Howard,
you madman.

507
00:37:09,564 --> 00:37:12,590
- Somewhere else. Excuse us.
- Charmed, gentlemen.

508
00:37:12,767 --> 00:37:16,396
Do help yourself to the poached pears.
I hear they're divine.

509
00:37:17,038 --> 00:37:19,802
Well. Howard Hughes,
ladies and gentlemen.

510
00:37:20,675 --> 00:37:22,006
Was that meant for me?

511
00:37:22,177 --> 00:37:25,544
My hero. God, all that
Hollywood talk bores me silly.

512
00:37:25,714 --> 00:37:28,683
As if there aren't more important things,
like Mussolini.

513
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:32,786
- Where are we going, by the way?
- Do you feel like a little adventure?

514
00:37:32,954 --> 00:37:34,888
Do your worst, Mr. Hughes.

515
00:37:35,056 --> 00:37:39,254
- Think you own this place, you limey bastard?
- I'm a Tasmanian bastard, you prick.

516
00:37:39,427 --> 00:37:41,827
- Thataway, Errol.
- Let me at him!

517
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:18,126
That's Mr. Mayer's house right there.

518
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:20,200
Do you know where Jack Warner lives?

519
00:38:29,477 --> 00:38:33,277
- What's that on the steering wheel?
- Cellophane.

520
00:38:33,448 --> 00:38:37,316
If you had any idea of the crap
that people carry around on their hands.

521
00:38:37,852 --> 00:38:39,479
What kind of crap?

522
00:38:40,188 --> 00:38:41,849
You don't wanna know.

523
00:38:47,128 --> 00:38:49,062
Hold on to the wheel for a bit.

524
00:38:57,138 --> 00:39:00,266
That's too hard. Relax your hand.
Relax your hand.

525
00:39:05,947 --> 00:39:10,907
You see, you gotta feel the vibration
of the engine through your fingertips.

526
00:39:11,086 --> 00:39:14,146
- Do you feel that?
- Yes.

527
00:39:16,758 --> 00:39:18,419
Well, that's good.

528
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:20,755
Golly!

529
00:39:25,166 --> 00:39:26,963
Well, she's all yours.

530
00:39:27,202 --> 00:39:30,865
- Where are you going?!
- I think there's some milk back here.

531
00:39:31,873 --> 00:39:34,671
- You just keep us steady, now.
- All right.

532
00:39:53,661 --> 00:39:55,492
- Howard.
- Yeah?

533
00:39:55,663 --> 00:39:58,632
There's a rather alarming mountain
heading our way.

534
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,995
Pull back on the wheel a smidge.
Go on.

535
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:08,434
Golly!

536
00:40:13,982 --> 00:40:19,147
I don't think I've ever met someone
who actually uses the word "golly."

537
00:40:26,394 --> 00:40:28,862
You all right?
Do you want me to take over?

538
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:31,021
Just when I'm getting the hang of it?

539
00:40:36,404 --> 00:40:40,101
- You want some milk?
- Oh, please.

540
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:04,260
Utterly smashing!
We'll do it again.

541
00:41:04,432 --> 00:41:07,595
I'm free Wednesday.
It's a little early for golf, though.

542
00:41:07,769 --> 00:41:10,033
Oh, no, no. I live right there.

543
00:41:10,538 --> 00:41:13,098
- Feel like a drink?
- Lead on.

544
00:41:14,309 --> 00:41:17,506
Now, that makes
for a challenging par four.

545
00:41:17,745 --> 00:41:21,442
My decorator
picked out the wallpaper and such.

546
00:41:22,083 --> 00:41:24,142
He's queer as a bedbug.

547
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:27,049
But I just hate this room.

548
00:41:27,355 --> 00:41:29,186
Gives me the willies.

549
00:41:29,691 --> 00:41:33,787
<i>Like I'm about to be swallowed up
by the latest issue of Town & Country.</i>

550
00:41:42,437 --> 00:41:44,200
What room do you like?

551
00:41:45,473 --> 00:41:46,963
My study.

552
00:41:49,344 --> 00:41:51,005
Take me there.

553
00:42:07,362 --> 00:42:10,388
You are the tallest woman I know.

554
00:42:11,332 --> 00:42:15,428
And all sharp elbows and knees.
Beware.

555
00:42:37,959 --> 00:42:41,019
Will you fly me to work tomorrow?

556
00:42:43,631 --> 00:42:45,826
It is tomorrow.

557
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:42,386
Keep your eye on the fuel. She's got
a minimum to keep her weight down.

558
00:43:42,557 --> 00:43:45,583
Two runs. That's it.
After that, you're flying on vapors.

559
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:48,524
And then you crash and you die.
Give her easy flying.

560
00:43:48,696 --> 00:43:51,995
Don't worry about speed
and don't think about the record today.

561
00:43:52,166 --> 00:43:55,624
I wish you'd let someone else take her.
You've got 20 test pilots.

562
00:43:55,803 --> 00:44:00,137
Hell, why should I let someone else
have all the fun? See you in a bit.

563
00:44:21,095 --> 00:44:22,858
Contact!

564
00:45:52,487 --> 00:45:53,715
339.

565
00:45:55,823 --> 00:45:57,688
Goddamn!

566
00:46:19,414 --> 00:46:20,938
347.

567
00:46:22,383 --> 00:46:23,680
Son of a bitch!

568
00:46:56,050 --> 00:46:58,610
- 352.
- 352!

569
00:46:59,854 --> 00:47:01,082
Good girl.

570
00:47:10,865 --> 00:47:12,560
Damn it!

571
00:47:16,370 --> 00:47:18,497
Goddamn it!

572
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:21,170
- Oh, God!
- There goes our meal ticket.

573
00:47:21,342 --> 00:47:22,832
Come on!

574
00:48:02,984 --> 00:48:04,417
Howard!

575
00:48:04,585 --> 00:48:06,746
- Howard!
- How did we do?

576
00:48:07,855 --> 00:48:10,187
352 on the last run.

577
00:48:11,959 --> 00:48:13,586
She'll go faster.

578
00:48:14,161 --> 00:48:15,788
Country mouse!

579
00:48:16,564 --> 00:48:19,965
- Kate! Katie!
- Upstairs, city mouse.

580
00:48:22,921 --> 00:48:25,822
Hello.
Good Lord, what happened to you?

581
00:48:25,991 --> 00:48:28,221
Oh, nothing. A hard landing.
I cut my foot.

582
00:48:28,394 --> 00:48:31,420
Sit down. I'll take care of it.
You tell me everything.

583
00:48:31,597 --> 00:48:35,431
You cannot imagine what it was like, Katie.
You cannot imagine the speed.

584
00:48:35,601 --> 00:48:38,764
- She was like a winged bullet up there.
- What did she make?

585
00:48:38,937 --> 00:48:43,101
Oh, around 352.

586
00:48:50,082 --> 00:48:51,549
You did it!

587
00:48:52,885 --> 00:48:54,750
Fastest man on the planet.

588
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:58,151
Hot dog! I'm so proud of you.

589
00:48:58,323 --> 00:49:00,314
- She did it, baby.
- You knew she would.

590
00:49:00,492 --> 00:49:03,461
Oh, she was fine. She was just fine.

591
00:49:04,663 --> 00:49:06,221
Now let me see your foot.

592
00:49:06,465 --> 00:49:07,762
Yeah.

593
00:49:08,467 --> 00:49:12,028
- Good God! You're covered in blood.
- Oh, no. That's just beet juice.

594
00:49:12,204 --> 00:49:14,365
- I crashed into a beet field.
- What?

595
00:49:14,540 --> 00:49:16,735
Yeah, I crashed in a beet field.

596
00:49:19,945 --> 00:49:22,038
Let me get you cleaned up.

597
00:49:23,048 --> 00:49:27,576
- Heavens, what is this? Electrical tape?
- Yeah. Odie just sort of slammed it on there.

598
00:49:28,620 --> 00:49:33,648
But all I could think about
was getting home to see you.

599
00:49:38,363 --> 00:49:41,230
I am so proud of you.

600
00:49:45,771 --> 00:49:48,137
Now, this is gonna sting a little bit.

601
00:49:48,307 --> 00:49:52,107
Oh, this is useless.
Come to the bathroom.

602
00:49:53,345 --> 00:49:56,212
- Don't get beet juice on the carpet.
- I won't, I won't.

603
00:49:56,381 --> 00:49:59,043
- Too hot!
- Don't be a baby.

604
00:50:00,719 --> 00:50:03,552
Was the press there?

605
00:50:04,490 --> 00:50:05,752
Some.

606
00:50:05,991 --> 00:50:11,088
But they're calling everyone.
Should be on the wires by now.

607
00:50:19,705 --> 00:50:21,263
What is it?

608
00:50:23,976 --> 00:50:25,568
Kate?

609
00:50:28,814 --> 00:50:31,908
I've been famous,
for better or worse...

610
00:50:32,451 --> 00:50:34,419
...for a long time now...

611
00:50:34,586 --> 00:50:38,920
...and I wonder if you know what it...

612
00:50:39,558 --> 00:50:41,355
...really means.

613
00:50:42,528 --> 00:50:45,622
<i>Yeah. I had my fair share
of press on Hell's Angels.</i>

614
00:50:46,398 --> 00:50:48,195
I'm used to it.

615
00:50:50,135 --> 00:50:51,830
Are you?

616
00:50:55,507 --> 00:50:57,270
Howard, we're...

617
00:51:00,212 --> 00:51:02,646
We're not like everyone else.

618
00:51:04,650 --> 00:51:09,587
Too many acute angles.
Too many eccentricities.

619
00:51:10,355 --> 00:51:13,222
We have to be very careful not to...

620
00:51:14,526 --> 00:51:18,360
...let people in,
or they'll make us into freaks.

621
00:51:19,565 --> 00:51:24,127
Kate, they can't get in here.
We're safe.

622
00:51:25,837 --> 00:51:27,737
They can always get in.

623
00:51:29,908 --> 00:51:33,309
When my brother killed himself...

624
00:51:34,479 --> 00:51:37,039
...there were photographers
at the funeral.

625
00:51:38,283 --> 00:51:40,513
There's no decency to it.

626
00:51:52,965 --> 00:51:55,024
You know, sometimes I...

627
00:51:58,770 --> 00:52:00,931
I get these feelings, Katie.

628
00:52:05,911 --> 00:52:08,471
I get these ideas, these...

629
00:52:11,316 --> 00:52:13,910
...crazy ideas about...

630
00:52:16,355 --> 00:52:18,721
...things that may not...

631
00:52:19,992 --> 00:52:22,859
Things that may not really be there.

632
00:52:23,528 --> 00:52:25,052
Yeah.

633
00:52:31,737 --> 00:52:34,501
Sometimes I truly fear that I'm...

634
00:52:36,541 --> 00:52:38,509
...Iosing my mind.

635
00:52:46,084 --> 00:52:47,949
And if I did, it would...

636
00:52:51,056 --> 00:52:53,422
It'd be like flying blind.

637
00:53:01,566 --> 00:53:03,227
You understand?

638
00:53:07,406 --> 00:53:10,204
You taught me to fly, Howard.

639
00:53:13,178 --> 00:53:15,169
I'll take the wheel.

640
00:53:31,096 --> 00:53:35,123
<i>Smashing all records. Howard Hughes
outdoes Jules Verne's wildest dreams.</i>

641
00:53:35,434 --> 00:53:38,699
<i>Around the world from New York
to New York in four days.</i>

642
00:53:38,870 --> 00:53:41,805
<i>Even beating Wiley Post's mark
by over three days.</i>

643
00:53:41,973 --> 00:53:45,204
<i>New aviation history is written
when his Lockheed monoplane...</i>

644
00:53:45,377 --> 00:53:48,369
<i>... returns swiftly and safely.
A daring aviator.</i>

645
00:53:48,814 --> 00:53:51,476
<i>A true pioneer of the world's airways.</i>

646
00:53:51,650 --> 00:53:55,643
<i>From New York to Paris. He cuts Lindbergh's
time in half. Then on to Moscow.</i>

647
00:53:55,821 --> 00:54:00,383
<i>Thirty-five hours out of New York.
He roars across Siberia's trackless wastes.</i>

648
00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:05,189
<i>Sixty hours out of New York. He heads
for Alaska. Most hazardous hop of all.</i>

649
00:54:05,363 --> 00:54:07,763
<i>Continuing the terrific pace.
He comes home...</i>

650
00:54:07,933 --> 00:54:10,265
<i>... bringing new laurels
to American aviation.</i>

651
00:54:11,603 --> 00:54:14,868
<i>Howard Hughes and his crew
may find more worlds to conquer...</i>

652
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:26,242
You won't believe this. It just came over the
wires. Hughes has bought control of TWA.

653
00:54:28,987 --> 00:54:31,854
I thought Mr. Hughes
was flying around the world.

654
00:54:32,057 --> 00:54:35,458
Apparently he did it while he was flying,
over the radio.

655
00:54:42,667 --> 00:54:45,966
I have heard some disquieting rumors
about Mr. Hughes.

656
00:54:47,539 --> 00:54:50,975
I'd like to know everything
there is to know about Mr. Hughes.

657
00:54:53,411 --> 00:54:55,641
I'd like you to attend to that for me.

658
00:54:56,648 --> 00:54:58,275
Thoroughly.

659
00:54:58,850 --> 00:55:01,284
<i>The Pantages is glittering tonight.</i>

660
00:55:01,453 --> 00:55:04,286
- Howard!
- Right over here. This way, over to the left.

661
00:55:04,456 --> 00:55:07,118
- Mr. Hughes, how was your flight?
- Miss Hepburn!

662
00:55:07,292 --> 00:55:09,954
- When are you gonna name the day?
- Raise your head.

663
00:55:10,128 --> 00:55:12,255
What's the next movie?
Give us the scoop.

664
00:55:12,430 --> 00:55:15,126
Right here. How many more
records are you gonna set?

665
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:18,599
Right over here. Come on.
Give us a smile. It won't kill you.

666
00:55:18,770 --> 00:55:20,670
- Howard, this way.
- Beautiful.

667
00:55:20,839 --> 00:55:23,330
Over here, over here, Mr. Hughes.

668
00:55:23,508 --> 00:55:25,942
When are you gonna fly
around the world again?

669
00:55:26,111 --> 00:55:30,104
You gonna fly with Kate next time?
Did you get Ionely without her?

670
00:55:30,282 --> 00:55:34,343
- Talk to Lindbergh about your flight yet?
- Where's Linda Darnell tonight?

671
00:55:34,519 --> 00:55:37,818
- Please, Mr. Hughes.
- Right here. Right here, Mr. Hughes.

672
00:55:37,989 --> 00:55:40,480
Are you trying to be more famous
than Lindbergh?

673
00:55:41,193 --> 00:55:44,924
You know,
fame is supposed to be my turf.

674
00:55:47,165 --> 00:55:48,792
L.B.!

675
00:55:51,436 --> 00:55:54,803
If you don't get more distinguished
every time I see you.

676
00:55:54,973 --> 00:55:56,998
You look so beautiful.

677
00:56:04,783 --> 00:56:06,410
Is that true?

678
00:56:15,227 --> 00:56:17,092
Don't worry about it, Howard.

679
00:56:17,262 --> 00:56:20,925
She's just working the room.
It's her job, baby.

680
00:56:23,969 --> 00:56:27,769
<i>Sultry Southern tigress Ava Gardner
dazzles the room tonight.</i>

681
00:56:27,939 --> 00:56:30,169
<i>She's the newest star
in the MGM galaxy.</i>

682
00:56:30,342 --> 00:56:33,971
<i>And believe you me.
She puts the "cheese" in "cheesecake."</i>

683
00:56:36,214 --> 00:56:41,743
<i>Well, Jane Eyre has been selling popcorn
for over a hundred years, L.B.</i>

684
00:57:22,494 --> 00:57:23,927
Hello.

685
00:57:25,563 --> 00:57:27,121
Hello.

686
00:57:32,337 --> 00:57:35,204
Could you reach me a towel?

687
00:57:42,647 --> 00:57:44,376
I...

688
00:57:45,517 --> 00:57:48,748
I really can't do that.

689
00:57:50,388 --> 00:57:51,912
I'm sorry.

690
00:58:16,748 --> 00:58:21,082
I'm an idiot. I'm a complete idiot,
and I'm sorry.

691
00:58:21,419 --> 00:58:25,014
- Forget it.
- No, no. I'm a vain, preening ass...

692
00:58:25,190 --> 00:58:30,184
...without a single redeeming feature.
- That's not true. You have very good teeth.

693
00:58:30,695 --> 00:58:32,162
Come on.

694
00:58:33,031 --> 00:58:37,365
I've got a better idea. Take me flying.
Or better yet, I'll take you flying.

695
00:58:37,535 --> 00:58:39,264
Do your worst, Miss Hepburn.

696
00:58:48,380 --> 00:58:52,214
Don't be so squirmy. You're gonna
get on famously with Father and Mother.

697
00:58:52,384 --> 00:58:56,013
And I'm sure they'll like you too.
Once they get to know you.

698
00:59:04,329 --> 00:59:07,127
- Hello! Hello!
- Kath, hello.

699
00:59:07,298 --> 00:59:08,856
Kathy.

700
00:59:11,803 --> 00:59:15,534
- Who's that with the camera right there?
- That's my ex-husband, Ludlow.

701
00:59:15,707 --> 00:59:17,971
Father and Mother are just mad
about Luddie.

702
00:59:18,143 --> 00:59:22,477
- What the hell's he doing here?
- Oh, he's here all the time.

703
00:59:23,381 --> 00:59:25,008
Hello!

704
00:59:26,518 --> 00:59:27,985
Sorry we're late.

705
00:59:28,153 --> 00:59:30,451
- Mom.
- Oh. Oh, thank you.

706
00:59:30,622 --> 00:59:32,249
- Dad.
- Darling.

707
00:59:32,424 --> 00:59:35,723
- Uncle Willy.
- Oh, who have we got here?

708
00:59:35,894 --> 00:59:38,624
- Don't feel self-conscious.
- Hepburns! Hepburns!

709
00:59:38,797 --> 00:59:42,563
Attention, please. This is Howard.

710
00:59:42,834 --> 00:59:44,665
Howard, welcome.

711
00:59:46,004 --> 00:59:48,097
Don't worry, he's had his lunch.

712
00:59:49,741 --> 00:59:51,606
He likes you. That's unusual.

713
00:59:51,776 --> 00:59:55,109
We pay our devotion to the arts here.
A colony we created.

714
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:59,239
Julian's a painter. Abstract, of course.
What's the point of painting...

715
00:59:59,417 --> 01:00:02,784
...something real when you can just
take a picture nowadays?

716
01:00:02,954 --> 01:00:05,422
Where do you stand on politics,
Mr. Hughes?

717
01:00:05,857 --> 01:00:08,382
- Excuse me?
- We're all socialists here.

718
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:09,993
We are not.

719
01:00:11,229 --> 01:00:13,823
You've met Mr. Roosevelt.
What make you of him?

720
01:00:17,035 --> 01:00:19,060
What are you sniggering at?

721
01:00:19,237 --> 01:00:21,603
- What? What was that?
- You just sniggered.

722
01:00:22,373 --> 01:00:25,365
No, no. The dog.
It seems to be crushing my feet.

723
01:00:25,543 --> 01:00:27,511
- Oh, my God!
- Buster!

724
01:00:27,679 --> 01:00:28,907
Hey. Hey!

725
01:00:30,582 --> 01:00:32,049
Don't you like dogs?

726
01:00:32,217 --> 01:00:34,879
I will not have you sniggering
at Mr. Roosevelt.

727
01:00:35,053 --> 01:00:36,782
- Please leave.
- No. I wasn't.

728
01:00:36,955 --> 01:00:39,924
- I thought everybody liked dogs.
- Perhaps he had a bad experience.

729
01:00:40,091 --> 01:00:42,559
Does it upset you
that Howard gets more press?

730
01:00:42,727 --> 01:00:45,890
- A bad experience with a dog?
- No, no.

731
01:00:46,064 --> 01:00:50,626
- You are such a shy creature, aren't you?
- Perhaps it was a very large dog.

732
01:00:50,802 --> 01:00:54,568
- The press can be a damned nuisance.
- Was it a Doberman?

733
01:00:54,739 --> 01:00:57,833
- A Doberman, Mr. Hughes? Or a dachshund?
- Neither, sir.

734
01:00:58,009 --> 01:01:02,241
- Dachshunds are little dogs, Hep dear.
- They should all be lined up and shot.

735
01:01:02,413 --> 01:01:05,610
- What's that Spanish painting?
- The Goya.

736
01:01:05,783 --> 01:01:07,978
Goya. Of course. Yes.

737
01:01:08,620 --> 01:01:11,783
- Yes, Mexican.
- What was that called?

738
01:01:11,956 --> 01:01:16,086
Anyway, that's the vulgar press, I'm sure.
Do you read much, Mr. Hughes?

739
01:01:17,729 --> 01:01:20,562
I try to stay up to snuff
on the trade journals, yeah.

740
01:01:20,732 --> 01:01:24,600
- Snuff?
- These would be flying magazines?

741
01:01:26,237 --> 01:01:28,671
- What was that?
- Oh, he's a little deaf.

742
01:01:28,840 --> 01:01:32,173
- Pass the goddamn butter, I beg you.
- You read flying magazines?

743
01:01:32,343 --> 01:01:35,403
Trade journals. On engineering. Aviation.

744
01:01:35,580 --> 01:01:37,309
We read books.

745
01:01:37,715 --> 01:01:41,981
Howard has to read the trade pieces, Mom,
because he's designing a new aeroplane.

746
01:01:42,153 --> 01:01:44,144
Oh, really? Do tell.

747
01:01:47,392 --> 01:01:48,916
Well...

748
01:01:50,662 --> 01:01:55,326
...it's quite exciting, actually.
It's a spy plane for the Air Corps.

749
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:57,627
A twin-engine plane with some...

750
01:01:57,802 --> 01:02:00,794
...I must admit,
some rather unique design features.

751
01:02:00,972 --> 01:02:03,532
You see,
it has these two booms at the back...

752
01:02:03,708 --> 01:02:06,768
Luddie built a birdhouse once.
You remember that, dear?

753
01:02:07,045 --> 01:02:10,242
- Yes, well, a mere trifle, darling.
- I remember the painting!

754
01:02:10,415 --> 01:02:13,077
<i>The painting, it's called
May 18-0- something.</i>

755
01:02:13,251 --> 01:02:16,118
Anyway, Goya's vastly overrated.
All the Spaniards are.

756
01:02:16,287 --> 01:02:18,983
- Nonsense! Picasso is sacred.
- I'm a urologist.

757
01:02:19,157 --> 01:02:22,024
- It was quite aesthetic, really.
- A sacred monster.

758
01:02:22,193 --> 01:02:24,855
The birds don't care for it much,
but the bats do.

759
01:02:25,029 --> 01:02:27,190
- I'll bet.
- That's such bunk!

760
01:02:27,365 --> 01:02:30,664
- Do speak up, dear.
- Nothing, nothing, Mrs. Hepburn. Nothing.

761
01:02:30,835 --> 01:02:34,703
Why did you speak? I can't abide people
who speak but have nothing to say.

762
01:02:34,872 --> 01:02:38,535
Did you go to mechanic school
to learn all this airplane guff?

763
01:02:38,710 --> 01:02:40,268
No, no, I didn't, Luddie. No.

764
01:02:40,445 --> 01:02:43,209
Well, Howard just flew round
the world in three days.

765
01:02:43,381 --> 01:02:46,316
- I think we've had enough about airplanes.
- And dogs.

766
01:02:46,484 --> 01:02:50,215
- Then how did you make all that money?
- We don't care about money here.

767
01:02:50,388 --> 01:02:52,356
Well, that's because you have it.

768
01:02:56,361 --> 01:02:57,692
Would you repeat that?

769
01:02:59,030 --> 01:03:01,965
You don't care about money
because you've always had it.

770
01:03:02,133 --> 01:03:05,102
- How did you make all that...?
- Excuse me, I'm speaking.

771
01:03:05,270 --> 01:03:06,498
- Okay.
- Thank you.

772
01:03:06,671 --> 01:03:08,138
All right.

773
01:03:08,573 --> 01:03:11,007
Some of us choose to work for a living.

774
01:03:11,175 --> 01:03:16,442
Speaking of which, I have more of that
airplane guff to attend to.

775
01:03:17,348 --> 01:03:18,906
Excuse me.

776
01:03:26,524 --> 01:03:29,186
Well, seems a rather high-strung chap.

777
01:03:29,627 --> 01:03:32,619
You're a fine bunch of bullies,
aren't you?

778
01:03:32,797 --> 01:03:36,096
<i>Have you talked to Mr. Mayer
about letting you do Jane Eyre?</i>

779
01:03:36,267 --> 01:03:39,566
The old philistine won't budge.
Too arty, don't you know.

780
01:03:39,737 --> 01:03:44,674
<i>I'm convinced the man hasn't read anything
longer than a Katzenjammer Kids in his life.</i>

781
01:03:46,044 --> 01:03:49,502
No fair, kicking.
You have to use the mallet.

782
01:03:51,316 --> 01:03:55,047
Really, darling, you can't retire
from the field of battle like that...

783
01:03:55,219 --> 01:03:58,677
...or they'll never respect you.
- Katie, I don't understand.

784
01:03:59,023 --> 01:04:01,491
You're like a different person in there.

785
01:04:02,260 --> 01:04:05,058
They just expect me to be a certain way.

786
01:04:06,998 --> 01:04:11,264
There's only one real Kate,
and that's your Kate.

787
01:04:14,739 --> 01:04:19,438
<i>Over in Hollywood. Aviation tycoon
Howard Hughes is cooking up something big.</i>

788
01:04:19,610 --> 01:04:24,104
<i>Even as he edits his new picture. He's been
secretly meeting with the U.S. Air Corps.</i>

789
01:04:24,282 --> 01:04:27,843
<i>We applaud his patriotism and look forward
to his newest marvel.</i>

790
01:04:28,019 --> 01:04:31,420
You know how many Allied ships we lost
because of U-boat attacks?

791
01:04:31,589 --> 01:04:33,716
- No.
- Six hundred and eighty-one ships...

792
01:04:33,891 --> 01:04:38,487
...just this year so far. The Army needs
a new airplane to fly the troops to Europe.

793
01:04:38,663 --> 01:04:42,155
These ships, they're sitting ducks
for the U-boats.

794
01:04:42,333 --> 01:04:45,996
- You wanna build a troop-carrier plane?
- Stop thinking like an insect.

795
01:04:46,170 --> 01:04:49,105
Not just to carry troops,
a plane to carry everything.

796
01:04:49,273 --> 01:04:53,539
The troops and the jeeps and the tanks
and whatnot. Here, take a look.

797
01:04:54,946 --> 01:04:56,777
No. Other side.

798
01:04:59,717 --> 01:05:03,244
I figure around 200 feet from nose to tail.
Wingspan, around 300.

799
01:05:03,421 --> 01:05:05,981
We're gonna need
about 24,000 horsepower.

800
01:05:07,291 --> 01:05:10,385
Now, this is just what Kaiser
and the Army are looking for.

801
01:05:10,561 --> 01:05:14,053
- They're gonna pay for it this time.
- What are you getting us into?

802
01:05:14,232 --> 01:05:17,099
Well, it's a big plane,
so I'm calling it The Hercules.

803
01:05:17,602 --> 01:05:19,126
Swell name, isn't it?

804
01:05:19,570 --> 01:05:22,733
- How heavy you imagine this thing is?
- Say around 200 tons.

805
01:05:25,910 --> 01:05:28,401
Well, I didn't say it was gonna be easy.

806
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:31,974
All right, boys,
I want you to rig up something like this.

807
01:05:32,150 --> 01:05:36,610
Should give the proper uplift ratios and
reduce need for torque support on the front.

808
01:05:36,788 --> 01:05:40,519
We are not getting enough production
out of Jane Russell's breasts.

809
01:05:40,691 --> 01:05:43,216
I want smooth titties, gentlemen.
Smooth titties.

810
01:05:46,030 --> 01:05:49,193
- It's all in engineering, isn't it, Odie?
- Howard...

811
01:05:49,700 --> 01:05:54,330
...do you really think they're gonna let you
put out a whole movie just about tits?

812
01:05:54,539 --> 01:05:57,406
Sure. Who doesn't like tits?

813
01:06:07,819 --> 01:06:11,084
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
Sorry I'm late.

814
01:06:11,255 --> 01:06:14,782
Please record that Mr. Hughes has arrived
and this session is now called to order.

815
01:06:15,960 --> 01:06:18,724
- I yield the floor to Mr. Breen.
- Mr. Hughes...

816
01:06:18,896 --> 01:06:22,798
<i>...members of the committee, I've reviewed
the photoplay entitled The Outlaw...</i>

817
01:06:22,967 --> 01:06:26,698
...and I can state that I have never seen
anything so unacceptable...

818
01:06:26,871 --> 01:06:30,807
...as the shots of the mammaries
of the character named Rio.

819
01:06:31,175 --> 01:06:35,271
For almost half the picture,
the girl's mammaries, which are quite large...

820
01:06:35,446 --> 01:06:38,643
...and prominent,
are shockingly uncovered.

821
01:06:39,584 --> 01:06:43,850
For this reason, I concluded the picture
appeals only to prurient interests...

822
01:06:44,021 --> 01:06:48,549
...and should be denied the Motion Picture
Association's seal of approval.

823
01:06:49,193 --> 01:06:51,423
Really, Mr. Hughes.

824
01:06:51,596 --> 01:06:55,225
- Thank you, Mr. Breen. Mr. Hughes.
- Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

825
01:06:55,566 --> 01:06:57,727
Mr. Breen. It's good to see you again.

826
01:06:57,902 --> 01:07:02,032
<i>I haven't seen you all since that situation
with all the violence in Scarface.</i>

827
01:07:02,240 --> 01:07:05,368
The situation here revolves
around Miss Russell's mammaries.

828
01:07:05,543 --> 01:07:08,103
Mr. Breen feels that they are
too prominent, yes?

829
01:07:08,279 --> 01:07:11,646
More prominent than other mammaries
have been up on the screen?

830
01:07:11,816 --> 01:07:14,444
Well, I hope to dispel that notion.

831
01:07:17,955 --> 01:07:19,388
Jean Harlow.

832
01:07:21,325 --> 01:07:22,952
Ann Sheridan.

833
01:07:24,395 --> 01:07:25,828
Irene Dunne.

834
01:07:25,997 --> 01:07:27,624
Claudette Colbert.

835
01:07:28,232 --> 01:07:29,927
Rita Hayworth.

836
01:07:30,334 --> 01:07:34,668
Betty Grable.
And the lovely Miss Jane Russell.

837
01:07:34,839 --> 01:07:39,208
Now, all these shots, save for Miss Russell,
were enlarged from pictures...

838
01:07:39,377 --> 01:07:42,642
...that received
Mr. Breen's seal of approval.

839
01:07:43,281 --> 01:07:48,378
Now, as you've probably noticed by now,
they all contain mammaries.

840
01:07:49,353 --> 01:07:52,379
I will ask my associate to join me now.
May I introduce...

841
01:07:52,557 --> 01:07:56,254
...Dr. Ludlow Branson
of Columbia University.

842
01:07:57,695 --> 01:07:59,560
Dr. Branson...

843
01:08:00,164 --> 01:08:03,622
...is a mathematician of some note.

844
01:08:03,801 --> 01:08:06,292
Yes. And he will now demonstrate...

845
01:08:06,470 --> 01:08:08,199
...that in fact...

846
01:08:08,372 --> 01:08:11,899
...Miss Russell's mammaries
are no more prominent...

847
01:08:12,076 --> 01:08:14,874
...than any of these other fine ladies'.

848
01:08:17,415 --> 01:08:18,677
Doctor.

849
01:08:20,184 --> 01:08:21,776
Doctor...

850
01:08:22,653 --> 01:08:24,917
...you forgot your calipers.

851
01:08:31,696 --> 01:08:34,927
Gentlemen, Mr. Hughes.

852
01:08:37,668 --> 01:08:40,193
Let us commence by calling this...

853
01:08:41,038 --> 01:08:43,336
...Mammary Exhibit Number One.

854
01:08:43,507 --> 01:08:49,275
Now, you'll see that the length
of the actual cleavage...

855
01:08:50,014 --> 01:08:53,211
...if I may, is...

856
01:08:54,251 --> 01:08:56,446
...5 inches and a quarter.

857
01:08:56,821 --> 01:08:58,186
Now if we move to Mammary Exhibit...

858
01:08:58,356 --> 01:08:59,823
<i>Dateline: Hollywoodland.</i>

859
01:08:59,991 --> 01:09:03,483
<i>Movie tycoon Howard Hughes
must have the greatest job in the land.</i>

860
01:09:03,661 --> 01:09:07,097
<i>Every night. The lucky guy escorts
a different beautiful woman...</i>

861
01:09:07,264 --> 01:09:09,198
<i>... to a different dazzling event.</i>

862
01:09:09,367 --> 01:09:14,031
<i>The TWA king always talks up
his airline as he escorts a succession...</i>

863
01:09:16,340 --> 01:09:18,467
<i>The Hercules. Ladies and gentlemen.</i>

864
01:09:18,643 --> 01:09:20,110
<i>The Hercules.</i>

865
01:09:20,277 --> 01:09:24,213
<i>A plane. A boat. A flying city.</i>

866
01:09:24,382 --> 01:09:27,840
Don't forget, every bill comes to me.
They don't pay for anything.

867
01:09:28,019 --> 01:09:31,455
Those men decide whether to fund
the plane, so I need them happy.

868
01:09:31,822 --> 01:09:34,086
- You do what it takes.
- You betcha, boss.

869
01:09:34,492 --> 01:09:36,790
How are the girls
in the bomb department?

870
01:09:36,961 --> 01:09:40,795
Well, let's put it this way,
it'll be a regular boob buffet.

871
01:09:40,965 --> 01:09:44,059
I don't think the Air Corps men
will have trouble scoring.

872
01:09:44,235 --> 01:09:47,898
<i>- Good.
- And inside. 700 brave American soldiers...</i>

873
01:09:48,072 --> 01:09:52,566
<i>... a dozen Sherman tanks all winging
their way over the Atlantic...</i>

874
01:09:52,743 --> 01:09:55,177
<i>... free from the threats
of the U-boats below.</i>

875
01:09:55,346 --> 01:09:59,680
<i>Could Jules Verne himself have
ever imagined anything so magnificent?</i>

876
01:09:59,850 --> 01:10:03,786
<i>Could he have imagined her mammoth
wingspan. Longer than a football field?</i>

877
01:10:04,055 --> 01:10:05,784
Don't you see how this demeans me?

878
01:10:05,956 --> 01:10:08,288
Since when do you care
about scandal rags?

879
01:10:08,459 --> 01:10:11,758
Every time there's a picture of you with
another woman, it's a slap in the face.

880
01:10:11,929 --> 01:10:14,898
- Don't you understand that?
- Well, that's overstating it.

881
01:10:15,066 --> 01:10:18,399
Joan Crawford, Ginger Rogers,
Linda Darnell, Joan Fontaine...

882
01:10:18,569 --> 01:10:21,470
...and now Bette Davis,
for God's sake.

883
01:10:23,340 --> 01:10:28,505
Look, they're Cracker Jack candy, honey.
They don't mean anything to me.

884
01:10:28,679 --> 01:10:31,648
Oh, very nice.

885
01:10:33,317 --> 01:10:36,218
You're the one that said
that all men are predators.

886
01:10:36,387 --> 01:10:39,288
I mean, it's all in Darwin, remember?

887
01:10:39,623 --> 01:10:43,218
And am I to expect this behavior
to continue after the wedding?

888
01:10:43,394 --> 01:10:45,453
What is really bothering you, Kate?

889
01:10:45,629 --> 01:10:48,894
Is it the women or the publicity?

890
01:10:54,138 --> 01:10:58,370
Can't you eat ice cream from a bowl
like everyone else in the world?

891
01:11:05,483 --> 01:11:09,044
Don't you dare.

892
01:11:20,731 --> 01:11:21,993
Yeah.

893
01:11:23,167 --> 01:11:26,762
No, Odie, this is not a good time.

894
01:11:27,004 --> 01:11:31,168
For chrissakes, we can't make The Hercules
if we don't have any aluminum.

895
01:11:31,342 --> 01:11:32,934
Wait.

896
01:11:33,110 --> 01:11:36,170
I can hear you better now.
Tell the War Production Board...

897
01:11:36,347 --> 01:11:39,544
...that this is an essential
strategic operation.

898
01:11:39,717 --> 01:11:44,279
If they're giving aluminum to Boeing,
they can give some to Hughes Aircraft.

899
01:11:44,455 --> 01:11:47,424
Don't set the ice cream...

900
01:11:47,591 --> 01:11:51,960
We gotta think of something else. If we
can't get aluminum, we'll find another way.

901
01:11:52,396 --> 01:11:55,729
You tell me. We'll find
some alloy that works just as well.

902
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,628
Right. Look...

903
01:11:58,803 --> 01:12:02,933
- lf we can't get aluminum, we'll use wood.
- You can't make a plane out of wood.

904
01:12:03,107 --> 01:12:05,632
Why not?
The damn thing is a flying boat, right?

905
01:12:05,810 --> 01:12:07,778
- What do they use to make boats?
- Oak.

906
01:12:07,945 --> 01:12:10,880
And think of The Hercules
like a flying Spanish galleon.

907
01:12:11,048 --> 01:12:13,846
Spanish galleons
can weigh 1200 tons.

908
01:12:14,718 --> 01:12:16,549
Good luck today.

909
01:12:17,087 --> 01:12:20,420
We just have to find the right wood.
Something light but strong.

910
01:12:20,591 --> 01:12:23,389
- Morning, Kate.
- Pine, cedar, maybe birch.

911
01:12:33,904 --> 01:12:35,496
Catch.

912
01:12:39,410 --> 01:12:41,207
From my farm.

913
01:12:41,779 --> 01:12:44,373
If you like it, I can get you a bushel.

914
01:12:57,194 --> 01:12:59,628
Trouble with Mr. Hughes?

915
01:13:05,035 --> 01:13:09,472
There's too much Howard Hughes
in Howard Hughes.

916
01:13:11,308 --> 01:13:13,333
That's the trouble.
