00:01:02,162 --> 00:01:04,630
JUNG Jin-young

2
00:01:08,168 --> 00:01:10,636
YANG Dong-geun

3
00:01:13,673 --> 00:01:16,642
HAN Chae-young

4
00:01:18,678 --> 00:01:21,647
KI Joo-bong, KIM Myoung-gook

5
00:01:28,521 --> 00:01:30,216
Damn it!

6
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:36,520
He's probably faster
than Carl Lewis

7
00:01:37,864 --> 00:01:40,924
He's definitely faster
than Carl Lewis

8
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:43,660
I'm a Korean detective

9
00:01:44,204 --> 00:01:47,435
I always chase them

10
00:01:48,007 --> 00:01:49,838
But there's nowhere for them to hide

11
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:55,907
No matter how fast they run,
they can't run away

12
00:01:56,216 --> 00:01:58,741
Our country is surrounded by the sea

13
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:01,284
There's a huge army in North Korea

14
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:03,113
There's nowhere to hide

15
00:02:40,193 --> 00:02:43,356
WILD CARD

16
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:57,134
- Hey! Jay-soo!
- Yes?

17
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:59,474
- What are you doing tonight?
- I have an appointment

18
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:02,446
Hey, I know you're lying.
How about a drink tonight?

19
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:05,643
- It's my mother's birthday
- Really?

20
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:11,289
Hey Cheol-gu!
How about a drink?

21
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:13,650
We're starting the Victoria
investigation today

22
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,125
Young-man, what about you?

23
00:03:15,261 --> 00:03:17,024
I'm going with him

24
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,467
Aren't you going home?

25
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:24,503
Myung-hwan, how about a drink?

26
00:03:24,571 --> 00:03:26,732
It's my wedding anniversary

27
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,430
- Really?
- Yes

28
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:31,938
Bastards

29
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:39,941
Mother's birthday and
a wedding anniversary?

30
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,782
Bastards

31
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:44,523
It's no use being nice
to those assholes

32
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:47,253
I should've worked them to the bone

33
00:03:47,293 --> 00:03:50,160
Director KIM Yoo-jin

34
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:52,992
- What about Ki-bok?
- No, sir

35
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:55,227
- Ki-choon?
- Sorry, Mr. OH

36
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:58,264
Eleven of us are going in,
including Myung and Gahp

37
00:03:58,371 --> 00:04:01,465
Are you making a soccer team?
You're not in charge now

38
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:05,007
I forced the youngsters to do it.
Forgive them

39
00:04:05,144 --> 00:04:07,908
You forgot the magic word,
"Please"

40
00:04:10,216 --> 00:04:12,309
Lieutenant! I'm going home

41
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:14,147
Where are you going?

42
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,745
I'm backing up Team 1 today

43
00:04:16,823 --> 00:04:18,051
I see

44
00:04:18,124 --> 00:04:20,217
- Young-dahl, are you ready?
- Go ahead

45
00:04:20,293 --> 00:04:22,124
Hurry up

46
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:24,555
- Jay, lock them up
- Yes

47
00:04:26,966 --> 00:04:28,661
Are you going somewhere too?

48
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:32,204
What's wrong with you?

49
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,103
A new investigation starts today

50
00:04:34,207 --> 00:04:35,697
I understand

51
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:40,910
I've got a little time
for just one drink

52
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,604
Just forget it

53
00:04:42,982 --> 00:04:44,779
Hey, c'mon

54
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,119
Hey!

55
00:04:53,726 --> 00:04:57,218
This one looks expensive

56
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:58,991
It's just a restaurant.
Let's go in

57
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:04,629
Why is it so dark?
Turn on the lights

58
00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:08,598
Happy birthday!

59
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:12,541
They are lovely

60
00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:15,638
It's so nice to get flowers

61
00:05:15,748 --> 00:05:18,148
I owe your wife.
Say thanks to her

62
00:05:18,217 --> 00:05:20,412
Don't mention it.
They are all over my house

63
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:23,284
What is this?

64
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:25,856
Open it. You'll like it

65
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:31,653
- Bremen...
- They're Bremens

66
00:05:31,764 --> 00:05:35,165
Made in Germany.
Swedish Raybeks were the best,

67
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:37,226
but now Bremens are better

68
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:41,603
Criminals like them because
they're light and comfortable

69
00:05:41,774 --> 00:05:45,676
Right.
These old ones were too heavy

70
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:48,142
Why can't we make them like these?

71
00:05:48,247 --> 00:05:51,045
They're just for criminals anyway

72
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:55,644
Ours are nice, too.
They are just heavy and loose

73
00:05:55,788 --> 00:05:58,814
- Remember Snakehead?
- Yeah

74
00:05:58,991 --> 00:06:03,257
One day I was writing a report
He says "Lieutenant" and

75
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:06,891
he looks at me and his wrists

76
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,033
And I noticed that
the cuffs were loose

77
00:06:10,636 --> 00:06:13,469
I said, "What the hell"
and he put them back on himself

78
00:06:16,609 --> 00:06:20,443
I searched the entire market for them

79
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:23,014
- Whose idea was it?
- Jay-soo's

80
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:24,777
Thanks boy

81
00:06:24,851 --> 00:06:27,081
Lieutenant, why don't you try them on?

82
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:28,911
Okay

83
00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:32,519
They're very light

84
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:36,124
I can't feel any weight

85
00:06:36,195 --> 00:06:38,288
A toast for the lieutenant

86
00:06:38,364 --> 00:06:42,562
- For Lieutenant Biannual!
- Cheers!

87
00:06:53,513 --> 00:06:55,071
What is it?

88
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:57,378
I left it in the office

89
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:59,715
Don't be kidding

90
00:06:59,986 --> 00:07:02,887
I'm not kidding

91
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:05,747
Hurry and go get it
before you drive him mad

92
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,489
Ok! Ok! Bastards

93
00:07:08,694 --> 00:07:12,528
Everything is on me tonight.
The drinks, the karaoke, everything

94
00:07:12,865 --> 00:07:15,356
Satisfied?

95
00:07:23,876 --> 00:07:28,779
When you truly love someone

96
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:34,151
a million roses will bloom

97
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:39,088
Without hatred, just love freely

98
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:41,387
They buried him with a shovel

99
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,759
When's he going to stop?

100
00:07:43,863 --> 00:07:45,353
I am sick of this song

101
00:07:45,431 --> 00:07:47,456
When he sings it a million times

102
00:07:47,533 --> 00:07:50,764
then the farmer ran for office!

103
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:56,475
A long life to you!

104
00:07:58,845 --> 00:08:01,040
Who are they?

105
00:08:02,215 --> 00:08:05,514
- Looks like a new gang
- Those rats...

106
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,249
Detective OH!

107
00:08:09,555 --> 00:08:12,649
8 months ago, on March 5th at 2 am,

108
00:08:12,725 --> 00:08:15,990
you shot twice at
the drug dealer suspect Hong

109
00:08:16,462 --> 00:08:20,694
He accused you of using
excessive force. You know that, right?

110
00:08:20,933 --> 00:08:24,494
Use of Force Rule clause 1,
The first shot must be a blank

111
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,729
Clause 2, you must warn them
to give up at least 3 times

112
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:29,398
If you shoot, you must shoot
the lower part of the body

113
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:31,176
Did you follow the regulations?

114
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:37,442
How can I tell someone
in a car to give up

115
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:39,515
and shoot the legs?

116
00:08:55,735 --> 00:09:00,229
He was only 10 meters
away from you

117
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:03,840
10 meters or 100 meters,
What's so important about it?

118
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:05,807
It's important

119
00:09:05,912 --> 00:09:09,973
He was only 10 meters away from you.
How could you shoot him in the back?

120
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:12,017
We had to catch him

121
00:09:12,184 --> 00:09:15,017
That's a use of excessive force

122
00:09:34,473 --> 00:09:36,839
Stop the bull shit!

123
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:52,085
He would sell drugs
even in a wheelchair

124
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:58,021
You were suspended for a month

125
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:00,497
in 1995 for the same reason

126
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,759
It was 25 days

127
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:07,403
That's it for today

128
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:22,078
Do you know that Korean Police work
more than 168 hours a month?

129
00:10:22,521 --> 00:10:24,785
Quit if you are tired

130
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:30,259
We work 15 nights a month,
but they only pay for 75 hours

131
00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:32,729
Quit if you don't like it

132
00:10:33,165 --> 00:10:35,497
For the last five years, out of
all government employees,

133
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:37,058
police officers were most likely
to die on duty

134
00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:39,899
Quit before you die

135
00:10:40,439 --> 00:10:44,637
You memorized all that?

136
00:10:44,744 --> 00:10:46,473
- Of course
- Why?

137
00:10:46,612 --> 00:10:48,239
It makes me look cool

138
00:11:13,205 --> 00:11:16,333
Excuse me. I'm doing random checks.
Your ID please?

139
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:21,475
KANG Nana 760624-2235013

140
00:11:21,547 --> 00:11:25,313
58-2 Sinsa-dong Kangnam Seoul

141
00:11:27,753 --> 00:11:29,584
Thank you for your cooperation

142
00:13:25,404 --> 00:13:26,996
Find anything?

143
00:13:27,072 --> 00:13:29,199
Looks like they killed her for money

144
00:13:30,042 --> 00:13:32,738
- What's that?
- It's the CCTV tape

145
00:13:42,788 --> 00:13:44,585
Did you contact her family?

146
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:46,019
Not yet

147
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:48,922
Then how are we going to
do the autopsy?

148
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:53,120
Who's going?

149
00:13:54,466 --> 00:13:57,435
Chil-sun, stop by tomorrow morning

150
00:13:58,204 --> 00:14:00,536
Um, I...

151
00:14:00,706 --> 00:14:03,106
Is there a problem?

152
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:06,773
I'll go

153
00:14:07,713 --> 00:14:08,907
Good

154
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:20,419
What are we going to tell them?

155
00:14:20,726 --> 00:14:23,160
I feel like a confessing criminal

156
00:14:27,499 --> 00:14:30,195
I have several things to ask you

157
00:14:30,302 --> 00:14:32,793
Did you get any strange calls?

158
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:42,003
Any visitors?

159
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:43,847
No

160
00:14:45,084 --> 00:14:46,881
I feel very...

161
00:14:58,998 --> 00:15:00,966
Fucking killers...

162
00:15:06,438 --> 00:15:10,602
She had a blow on the head.
No cuts or incisive wounds

163
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:14,841
The wound isn't sharp,

164
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:17,744
and the weapon could've been
a blunt metal object or bat

165
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:20,477
Right now, this tape is all we have

166
00:15:20,552 --> 00:15:24,318
We can't tell anything except
that there were four of them

167
00:15:25,324 --> 00:15:29,021
HAN Tae-jung, age 40,
a money exchanger in the black market

168
00:15:29,461 --> 00:15:33,124
Her husband died 4 years ago.
She lived with her mother and two children

169
00:15:33,565 --> 00:15:37,695
had about 2 million Won
and 2,000 US Dollars with her

170
00:15:37,903 --> 00:15:42,272
It doesn't seem like
any kind of revenge

171
00:15:42,474 --> 00:15:44,066
I see

172
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:48,178
Then, there's a high possibility
that it was just for the money

173
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:52,842
Criminal Team 3 take this case.
You had the best results last year

174
00:15:53,018 --> 00:15:55,578
during the intensive enforcement period

175
00:15:55,688 --> 00:15:57,087
That's it

176
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:02,082
Which do you hate most?
Rape or murder?

177
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:03,287
Murder

178
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:05,887
Me too.
Imagine yourself as a victim

179
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:09,666
Dying of no reason
all of a sudden

180
00:16:10,202 --> 00:16:11,965
Fucking lunatics

181
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:16,301
At least robbers tell you to freeze.
These lunatics just kill

182
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:21,541
If someone strikes the back
of your head and runs away,

183
00:16:22,348 --> 00:16:25,875
which way will he run?
The palace, City Hall,

184
00:16:26,218 --> 00:16:29,210
the Arch or downtown?

185
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:32,517
- Myung-hwan, tell me
- Yeah?

186
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:34,819
- City Hall
- Downtown Downtown

187
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:36,861
But, how can you know?

188
00:16:36,895 --> 00:16:38,886
Who knows where he'll go?

189
00:16:38,964 --> 00:16:41,990
I wonder if the arrest rate is real

190
00:16:42,134 --> 00:16:43,601
Cut it out

191
00:16:44,069 --> 00:16:46,629
We don't need to spoil
the beer before we open it

192
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:49,737
What's going on?
Put that out!

193
00:16:50,909 --> 00:16:54,140
Jay-soo, give me the names of
the subway stations in Seoul

194
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:58,108
Apgujung, Sinsa, Jamwon,
Cheongdam, Nonhyun, Hakdong...

195
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:00,179
- Bus stops
- Yeah?

196
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:02,116
Can you count them all?

197
00:17:02,721 --> 00:17:04,780
You can't!

198
00:17:05,257 --> 00:17:06,884
What are you going to do?

199
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:08,658
Young-dahl!

200
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:11,730
Arrest all the gangs in the area
and torture them until

201
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:13,924
- we get something
- Correct!

202
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:18,194
Patrol and patrol, work and work
and arrest anyone suspicious!

203
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:20,865
Report to me at 5 am.
Every morning

204
00:17:21,106 --> 00:17:24,439
Chli-sun, what does that mean?

205
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:27,505
It means we can't go home

206
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,179
Over

207
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:33,641
You look awesome!

208
00:17:33,752 --> 00:17:37,347
Mr. OH I work hard now

209
00:17:37,689 --> 00:17:41,352
Hard?

210
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:44,756
You seem to be making easy money

211
00:17:44,963 --> 00:17:46,624
Where's Sang-taek?

212
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:50,596
I haven't seen him for a while

213
00:17:50,803 --> 00:17:54,204
You, you and you.
The three of you!

214
00:17:54,473 --> 00:17:57,067
Be at the office with Sang-taek by 2

215
00:17:57,109 --> 00:18:00,510
I really don't know, detective OH

216
00:18:00,646 --> 00:18:03,114
Do you think I do?

217
00:18:03,215 --> 00:18:05,581
- 2 o'clock. Ok?
- Yes, sir

218
00:18:20,065 --> 00:18:22,192
You're pathetic

219
00:18:22,868 --> 00:18:24,665
Cover up!

220
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:26,899
What's wrong with your hand?

221
00:18:26,972 --> 00:18:28,303
- Got hurt
- When?

222
00:18:28,407 --> 00:18:30,034
- A few days ago
- Where?

223
00:18:30,075 --> 00:18:31,337
- At a nightclub, sir
- How?

224
00:18:31,376 --> 00:18:32,434
Opening a beer

225
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:34,206
Not opening someone's
head with that beer?

226
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:38,477
What? I'm a lefty.
This is my right hand

227
00:18:38,584 --> 00:18:41,917
Horsenose and Hoon were there too

228
00:18:41,987 --> 00:18:43,147
You can ask them

229
00:18:43,188 --> 00:18:46,021
Then come to the office with
Horsenose and Hoon by 2 tomorrow

230
00:18:46,091 --> 00:18:47,615
Yes, sir

231
00:18:47,826 --> 00:18:49,316
Lie down

232
00:18:52,364 --> 00:18:53,763
Myong-hwan!

233
00:18:54,199 --> 00:18:55,689
What's up?

234
00:18:55,734 --> 00:18:57,725
- Got anything new?
- Not yet

235
00:18:57,836 --> 00:18:59,463
What about Chil-sun?

236
00:19:04,776 --> 00:19:07,609
You ask me

237
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:10,807
Let's go. Catch you later

238
00:19:11,016 --> 00:19:12,643
Take care

239
00:19:13,418 --> 00:19:15,750
- I like you and you know that, right?
- Thanks

240
00:19:15,854 --> 00:19:18,448
But sometimes you drive me nuts

241
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:23,553
What was Chil doing last month
during the intensive enforcement period

242
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:25,425
when we were risking our lives?

243
00:19:25,564 --> 00:19:29,261
He arrested teenagers
fighting around schools

244
00:19:29,368 --> 00:19:33,304
and tricked them into handcuffs
with pizzas

245
00:19:33,372 --> 00:19:35,602
Only 16 or 17 years old!

246
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:39,110
I am not a teacher or a minister,
but it ain't right

247
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:41,612
You should talk to him!

248
00:19:41,713 --> 00:19:43,704
Why do you always shut up
when it's about Chil!

249
00:19:43,815 --> 00:19:45,146
Jay-soo...

250
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:47,716
I like you too

251
00:20:05,504 --> 00:20:07,369
What brings you here detective

252
00:20:07,472 --> 00:20:09,269
Don't worry

253
00:20:13,278 --> 00:20:14,802
Take care, detective

254
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,915
That's mine

255
00:20:19,985 --> 00:20:22,010
Treat others' things like yours,
you asshole!

256
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,054
How much do you get for these?

257
00:20:24,356 --> 00:20:26,256
I pick them for 10,000 and
pass them on for 30,000

258
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:28,885
30,000? You said 15,000!

259
00:20:28,961 --> 00:20:32,226
- I knew you were cheating
- Behave, you shitheads

260
00:20:32,764 --> 00:20:36,291
Hurry and get in 1,2,3

261
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:42,464
Can't you get a bigger car?

262
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:50,106
From 8pm 23rd to 4am 24th

263
00:20:50,248 --> 00:20:55,550
Write down everything
you did In detail

264
00:20:55,954 --> 00:20:59,890
Where you ate and
when you shit. Everything!

265
00:21:00,325 --> 00:21:04,819
If you fool around, you know
what'll happen. Do it now!

266
00:21:06,531 --> 00:21:08,795
What are you looking at, asshole?

267
00:21:11,503 --> 00:21:14,063
Sit straight! Where do you live?

268
00:21:14,839 --> 00:21:16,431
Chamsil, sir

269
00:21:16,508 --> 00:21:18,271
What does your father do?

270
00:21:18,543 --> 00:21:20,340
Owns a gas station

271
00:21:20,979 --> 00:21:23,311
Then you must be well off

272
00:21:23,515 --> 00:21:26,313
Why the hell is a rich kid
doing such a thing!

273
00:21:27,485 --> 00:21:29,316
What's his phone number?

274
00:21:29,721 --> 00:21:31,655
- His phone's not working
- Not working?

275
00:21:32,023 --> 00:21:34,992
- Don't you dare give me bullshit!
- Can I talk for a second?

276
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:37,228
Why? I'm busy

277
00:21:37,395 --> 00:21:39,386
- Look after him
- Yes, sir

278
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:48,970
Is this your home?

279
00:21:53,878 --> 00:21:59,009
What are you doing with a kid when
we are fucking after a murder case?

280
00:22:02,153 --> 00:22:04,212
He had a knife.
You know that kind of kids

281
00:22:04,322 --> 00:22:07,450
He was prying coins from
videogames They're on my desk

282
00:22:07,525 --> 00:22:09,755
I used to have that kind of knife
at school, too

283
00:22:09,894 --> 00:22:12,021
You can let him go with a warning

284
00:22:12,063 --> 00:22:13,394
You don't know what you're saying

285
00:22:13,431 --> 00:22:16,229
Those bastards turn into pickpockets,
robbers and killers

286
00:22:16,434 --> 00:22:17,901
You got to nip out the bud

287
00:22:17,969 --> 00:22:19,903
Not nurturing it?

288
00:22:22,207 --> 00:22:24,698
- What do you mean?
- So you will send him to prison?

289
00:22:24,809 --> 00:22:28,176
Perhaps you can recommend
a lawyer to his parents

290
00:22:29,314 --> 00:22:31,782
You son of a bitch!
Don't talk to me like that

291
00:22:31,883 --> 00:22:34,647
Right. I want the kickback
from the lawyer

292
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:36,278
Jay-soo, go in

293
00:22:36,321 --> 00:22:38,983
I'm not working with that dirty cop

294
00:22:40,024 --> 00:22:41,889
Son of a bitch

295
00:22:44,562 --> 00:22:47,759
Do I have to work with disrespect?

296
00:22:47,932 --> 00:22:50,423
Calm down.
What's wrong with you two?

297
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:51,968
You mean I'm wrong?

298
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:55,198
This is an emergency.
Jay-soo wasn't totally wrong

299
00:22:55,273 --> 00:22:57,639
- Hey!
- Do you have a light?

300
00:22:58,977 --> 00:23:01,377
There was a murder in the jurisdiction

301
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:03,840
This is a house of death

302
00:23:04,782 --> 00:23:10,414
Who fights in a mourner's house?

303
00:23:11,055 --> 00:23:12,886
After washing all the socks...

304
00:23:13,258 --> 00:23:17,388
of those senior detectives,
and it's not turning out like

305
00:23:17,495 --> 00:23:19,588
you thought it would?

306
00:23:21,332 --> 00:23:24,597
Don't act like kids
after 10 years of experience

307
00:23:24,836 --> 00:23:27,031
stubborn fools

308
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:41,886
Sook, where's my underwear?

309
00:23:41,986 --> 00:23:44,716
Right corner of the bottom drawer

310
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:48,918
He's not the detective type

311
00:23:49,027 --> 00:23:50,051
Why not?

312
00:23:50,361 --> 00:23:52,295
What kind of a detective changes
his underwear everyday?

313
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:56,059
Right. Some don't change it
until the case is solved

314
00:23:58,603 --> 00:24:02,095
Of course.
That's how it should be

315
00:24:10,181 --> 00:24:14,481
The inspectors came by
They were very inquisitive

316
00:24:14,586 --> 00:24:18,420
They even had the certification of
your family's land

317
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:20,490
So what did you tell them?

318
00:24:20,658 --> 00:24:25,357
I almost said that
you're running to be buried,

319
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:28,528
not to get money

320
00:24:28,666 --> 00:24:30,566
Just quit that job

321
00:24:30,668 --> 00:24:32,727
Detectives who can't shoot.
What good are they?

322
00:24:32,837 --> 00:24:35,397
Quit and water flowers?

323
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,904
Or you can run a karaoke

324
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:41,342
and sing A Million Roses
over and over

325
00:24:41,546 --> 00:24:43,741
Enough. Let's go

326
00:24:43,848 --> 00:24:45,406
Good night

327
00:24:45,483 --> 00:24:47,041
The phone's ringing

328
00:24:53,458 --> 00:24:54,686
Flower shop!

329
00:24:54,759 --> 00:24:57,353
I'll burn your fucking roses bitch!

330
00:24:57,462 --> 00:25:01,228
I'll shave your head and
shove it down the fucking drain

331
00:25:01,399 --> 00:25:04,391
Your husband ruined me by
sending me to that fucking prison!

332
00:25:04,502 --> 00:25:06,402
Where's your fucking husband?

333
00:25:16,814 --> 00:25:20,181
Who told you to hang up bitch!
Do that again

334
00:25:20,251 --> 00:25:25,689
and I'll fry you,
your husband and your baby!

335
00:25:33,197 --> 00:25:35,859
You still don't get me bitch?

336
00:25:35,933 --> 00:25:37,867
Why don't you call up his mobile?

337
00:25:37,902 --> 00:25:41,167
It's 016-285-1605

338
00:25:41,205 --> 00:25:42,536
You fucking

339
00:25:45,743 --> 00:25:47,301
Son of a bitch

340
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:21,178
Why didn't you hit him, damn it!

341
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:23,543
- A car was passing
- Why did you hesitate?

342
00:26:23,614 --> 00:26:26,208
- They could've seen me
- You should've hit him earlier

343
00:26:26,317 --> 00:26:28,114
- Damn it!
- Stupid fucking loser

344
00:26:28,219 --> 00:26:30,153
- Fucking moron
- Motherfucker!

345
00:26:30,221 --> 00:26:32,189
You asshole!

346
00:26:34,625 --> 00:26:36,490
Fucking hell!

347
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:39,563
Damn it, you think you can

348
00:26:39,664 --> 00:26:43,065
just kick me out like that?

349
00:26:43,134 --> 00:26:47,332
Drive in hell forever, motherfucker!

350
00:26:48,272 --> 00:26:50,502
She's something

351
00:26:50,575 --> 00:26:52,509
You like her?

352
00:26:53,177 --> 00:26:55,168
Come on

353
00:26:57,148 --> 00:26:59,275
Motherfucker! Get off me!

354
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:01,350
Let me go

355
00:27:03,154 --> 00:27:05,486
Get off me! You assholes!

356
00:27:09,727 --> 00:27:11,627
Help him

357
00:27:12,597 --> 00:27:14,929
Hey, put that away

358
00:27:20,872 --> 00:27:23,568
- What's that?
- Hold on

359
00:27:23,641 --> 00:27:25,472
We'll send you to paradise

360
00:27:26,611 --> 00:27:28,044
Stop it!

361
00:27:29,947 --> 00:27:31,380
I'll do it! Stop!

362
00:27:31,449 --> 00:27:34,179
Get that thing off me. Do it

363
00:27:36,788 --> 00:27:38,756
Now you're talking

364
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:44,219
Motherfuckers! Go ahead

365
00:27:54,906 --> 00:27:56,669
You motherfuckers!

366
00:27:56,874 --> 00:28:00,139
Say something!

367
00:28:00,411 --> 00:28:04,142
I was raped on a main street!

368
00:28:04,582 --> 00:28:07,847
Not one but by four, damn it

369
00:28:07,952 --> 00:28:11,115
The patrol car drove right by!
Are you cops blind?

370
00:28:11,322 --> 00:28:15,156
I wouldn't have come here if
I was raped in a back street!

371
00:28:18,262 --> 00:28:21,356
I won't put up with this

372
00:28:21,499 --> 00:28:24,991
I'll sue the Korean government

373
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:28,005
And report this to the
Women's Association!

374
00:28:28,105 --> 00:28:31,768
Bargirls can be raped on the street?

375
00:28:31,909 --> 00:28:35,208
Who is in charge!
Where's the chief?

376
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:41,514
Please calm down

377
00:28:41,619 --> 00:28:45,612
- Are you the chief?
- I'm a lieutenant

378
00:28:46,023 --> 00:28:50,050
I don't want any lieutenants!
Where's the fucking chief?

379
00:29:02,139 --> 00:29:05,108
Did they threaten you with a knife?

380
00:29:05,977 --> 00:29:07,444
No

381
00:29:07,545 --> 00:29:09,342
Any weapons?

382
00:29:11,315 --> 00:29:15,376
Oh, they put a metal ball in my back
and almost crushed me

383
00:29:21,192 --> 00:29:23,023
Let me see

384
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:32,661
I don't know

385
00:29:32,737 --> 00:29:36,002
They all look the same.
It's damn confusing

386
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:39,406
Have a good look.
Only eyes are left now

387
00:29:49,053 --> 00:29:50,918
What does the ID Team say?

388
00:29:51,055 --> 00:29:54,286
It could be a metal ball given
the shape of the wound

389
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:56,920
- Really?
- Yes

390
00:29:57,128 --> 00:29:59,153
Please take a closer look

391
00:30:05,269 --> 00:30:07,294
She has such a temper

392
00:30:07,738 --> 00:30:10,172
- Biannual had a very hard time
- Yeah, right

393
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:14,634
Who gave him that nickname?

394
00:30:15,579 --> 00:30:17,774
Do you know?

395
00:30:18,616 --> 00:30:22,074
His wife, when she was pissed off

396
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:24,253
Why?

397
00:30:24,455 --> 00:30:27,822
He used to be number 1 in arrest rate

398
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:30,893
He'd catch one on his way to work
and two on the way back

399
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:34,021
Guess how many days he went home?
He lived in the office

400
00:30:34,131 --> 00:30:36,190
Ah! He went home biannually

401
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:38,825
Use your brain!
He does her biannually

402
00:31:10,668 --> 00:31:13,603
There must be a million in that bag

403
00:31:14,271 --> 00:31:18,401
Look at that expensive watch.
He must be going to the dawn market

404
00:31:47,138 --> 00:31:49,698
Oh my! Fucking old hobo

405
00:31:49,807 --> 00:31:51,434
Let's go

406
00:32:19,503 --> 00:32:24,668
Murders and thefts have occurred

407
00:32:24,708 --> 00:32:30,340
in the downtown area

408
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:34,214
Yesterday at 5 am, a man in 70's

409
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:37,152
was found dead with
a wound in the head

410
00:32:37,254 --> 00:32:39,654
The police are looking for witnesses,

411
00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:42,557
and yet are investigating
the area for clues

412
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:45,857
- Fuck! Fuck!
- What?

413
00:32:46,864 --> 00:32:48,661
This old man

414
00:32:49,066 --> 00:32:52,365
If we had walked out from
that store 5 minutes later,

415
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:55,598
he wouldn't have died.
Damn it!

416
00:33:00,978 --> 00:33:02,536
Where are you going?

417
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:05,010
Thieves will catch thieves

418
00:33:11,789 --> 00:33:15,486
Come out, Teddy Bear!

419
00:33:16,427 --> 00:33:18,327
Come on out, Teddy Bear!

420
00:33:20,464 --> 00:33:22,762
Aren't you gonna come out,
Teddy Bear?

421
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,101
Gosh! It's being torn!

422
00:33:26,237 --> 00:33:28,068
Hurry up. Teddy Bear

423
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:32,008
My brother's ruining your tables!

424
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:37,675
God damn it

425
00:33:38,649 --> 00:33:40,310
Anything wrong?

426
00:33:40,818 --> 00:33:42,513
Not at all. Please continue

427
00:33:42,586 --> 00:33:44,110
You have good cards

428
00:33:44,722 --> 00:33:47,020
I'll kill the Bulldozer...

429
00:33:50,928 --> 00:33:53,294
Forgive me for not stopping by
for a while

430
00:33:53,464 --> 00:33:55,955
Hey, the fabric's too soft

431
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:59,829
- Hi, Teddy Bear
- How are you, sir?

432
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:02,399
You look good

433
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,201
A small world is better
than the big cell, isn't it?

434
00:34:04,275 --> 00:34:05,640
Of course, sir

435
00:34:07,645 --> 00:34:10,273
- Where's Sang-chun?
- Sang-chun?

436
00:34:10,848 --> 00:34:13,578
- I haven't seen him
- Really?

437
00:34:15,352 --> 00:34:17,650
I heard you live off of dirty money

438
00:34:18,255 --> 00:34:20,553
It's all I can do to feed myself, sir

439
00:34:20,724 --> 00:34:22,749
Who gave you the money for
the gambling house

440
00:34:24,595 --> 00:34:27,393
Fucking Sang-chun did, bastard
Where is he?

441
00:34:27,998 --> 00:34:30,159
- I don't know
- Really?

442
00:34:33,737 --> 00:34:35,102
You don't know?

443
00:34:37,975 --> 00:34:43,106
I can find out through other sources

444
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:48,010
After wiping out this
place with the bulldozer?

445
00:34:48,118 --> 00:34:50,211
Should I?

446
00:34:50,955 --> 00:34:53,014
I will if you want

447
00:34:53,290 --> 00:34:57,317
He'll kill me if he finds out

448
00:35:03,801 --> 00:35:05,996
Who's Sang-chun?

449
00:35:06,303 --> 00:35:08,362
You know the Elegance Gang party?

450
00:35:08,505 --> 00:35:12,566
Hairtail, Flatfish, and that
bar owner Sausage?

451
00:35:12,676 --> 00:35:15,804
- He's their boss
- Fucker of the fuckers

452
00:35:15,879 --> 00:35:17,608
A king fucker

453
00:35:19,216 --> 00:35:23,175
Sang-chun! Where are you?

454
00:35:23,254 --> 00:35:25,984
- Who is Sang-chun?
- Your boss

455
00:35:26,056 --> 00:35:28,217
There's no one here by that name

456
00:35:28,792 --> 00:35:30,282
Excuse me, sir!

457
00:35:31,495 --> 00:35:35,898
What's Sang-chun doing?

458
00:35:37,401 --> 00:35:40,427
- Sang-chun, where are you?
- Shut the door!

459
00:35:44,708 --> 00:35:47,006
What's Sang-chun doing?

460
00:35:48,078 --> 00:35:50,103
Boss, look!

461
00:35:52,116 --> 00:35:53,743
Oh dear

462
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:58,353
How can 2 devils appear
in this decent place at once!

463
00:35:58,822 --> 00:36:00,790
I'll take care of them

464
00:36:00,891 --> 00:36:03,860
No, they're not the corrupt kind

465
00:36:04,028 --> 00:36:07,156
Don't make us go crazy

466
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:10,459
Where is he?

467
00:36:11,035 --> 00:36:13,902
Who the fuck are you?
Who's talking so loud?

468
00:36:14,071 --> 00:36:17,598
You look like a weasel,
just like your boss

469
00:36:17,741 --> 00:36:19,800
- Shut up you motherfucker!
- You asshole!

470
00:36:24,915 --> 00:36:26,746
Who are you?

471
00:36:28,252 --> 00:36:29,879
Police

472
00:36:33,857 --> 00:36:36,655
Don't kill all my boys

473
00:36:36,927 --> 00:36:39,623
I won't hold back today!

474
00:36:45,269 --> 00:36:46,702
Detectives!

475
00:36:48,072 --> 00:36:49,937
How've you been, gentlemen?

476
00:36:50,474 --> 00:36:53,204
You look marvelous!
This way, please

477
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:56,377
What are you doing?
Hurry and let them in!

478
00:36:56,580 --> 00:37:00,016
They're new here.
Please forgive their rudeness

479
00:37:00,084 --> 00:37:02,052
Please come inside

480
00:37:04,688 --> 00:37:06,315
Please

481
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:08,889
What are you doing?

482
00:37:08,959 --> 00:37:11,086
Go back to work!

483
00:37:12,229 --> 00:37:14,390
Left turn, gentlemen

484
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:24,841
Hanna! Bring us the
sweet turtle blood

485
00:37:24,908 --> 00:37:26,500
OK Ok OK

486
00:37:27,444 --> 00:37:29,537
This is how I live

487
00:37:29,646 --> 00:37:31,546
Anyway, what brings you here sir?

488
00:37:31,615 --> 00:37:33,583
From now on, don't talk or ask

489
00:37:33,684 --> 00:37:34,946
Why not, sir?

490
00:37:35,018 --> 00:37:38,419
It's very disturbing.
Just answer my questions

491
00:37:39,923 --> 00:37:44,155
You know that there'd been
two serial murders, right?

492
00:37:45,896 --> 00:37:48,421
You can speak when I ask

493
00:37:49,032 --> 00:37:51,432
I didn't know.
When did that happen?

494
00:37:51,502 --> 00:37:54,164
I've no idea who they are
but they must be

495
00:37:54,204 --> 00:37:55,466
Stop!

496
00:37:56,874 --> 00:38:01,072
You are a legend among muggers.
You are a king to them

497
00:38:01,545 --> 00:38:03,376
It doesn't make sense that
the king doesn't know anything

498
00:38:03,647 --> 00:38:06,241
Gather your boys by tomorrow

499
00:38:06,583 --> 00:38:08,642
I can't.
They'll starve to death!

500
00:38:09,353 --> 00:38:10,820
You can't?

501
00:38:14,091 --> 00:38:17,185
Giant Hotel lobby, restaurant row

502
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:20,559
Holy Nightclub.
Your muggers did all those

503
00:38:20,898 --> 00:38:23,628
Excuse me, sir!
What are you saying?

504
00:38:23,834 --> 00:38:27,235
They're not muggers. They just
took wallets from some drunks

505
00:38:27,704 --> 00:38:29,899
They're just pickpockets

506
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:32,135
Why bring that up all of a sudden?

507
00:38:32,209 --> 00:38:34,677
Those happened ages ago

508
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:37,474
There are tons of crimes to lock
you up. Want me to count'em?

509
00:38:38,282 --> 00:38:39,977
That's enough

510
00:38:40,117 --> 00:38:43,917
Call everyone. Hairtail, Flatfish,
Teddy Bear and Sausage

511
00:38:44,121 --> 00:38:46,521
Everyone. No exceptions!

512
00:38:46,623 --> 00:38:47,851
Sure, I get you

513
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:51,688
Enjoy the drinks

514
00:39:04,808 --> 00:39:06,469
It's late

515
00:39:12,049 --> 00:39:13,573
What are you doing?

516
00:39:27,064 --> 00:39:28,463
Salute!

517
00:39:28,565 --> 00:39:30,863
Excuse me. Random check.
ID please?

518
00:39:31,602 --> 00:39:35,060
KANG Nana 760624-2235013

519
00:39:35,138 --> 00:39:38,699
58-2 Sinsa-Dong Kangnam Seoul

520
00:39:40,043 --> 00:39:42,409
Thank you for your cooperation.
Salute!

521
00:39:54,424 --> 00:39:56,358
- What do you think?
- She's the one?

522
00:39:56,426 --> 00:39:57,916
Isn't she awesome?

523
00:39:57,995 --> 00:40:00,555
Yeah, she's great

524
00:40:00,664 --> 00:40:02,154
Why are you staring at her?

525
00:40:02,232 --> 00:40:03,961
No reason. She's too pretty

526
00:40:04,301 --> 00:40:06,030
Very attractive, huh?

527
00:40:06,103 --> 00:40:07,730
But she's stubborn

528
00:40:07,871 --> 00:40:11,068
I checked her more than 20 times
and she never said a word

529
00:40:11,174 --> 00:40:14,575
It'll never work empty handed

530
00:40:14,778 --> 00:40:17,372
You have to give her something

531
00:40:17,447 --> 00:40:20,143
Like a TWIX at least

532
00:40:34,898 --> 00:40:37,492
What's this? Is this the criminal?

533
00:40:44,474 --> 00:40:47,500
Detective, it's impossible

534
00:40:48,378 --> 00:40:50,744
One third of Koreans look like this

535
00:40:53,049 --> 00:40:54,607
Look!

536
00:40:55,618 --> 00:40:57,643
Don't they look the same?

537
00:41:00,456 --> 00:41:02,447
They look the same!

538
00:41:04,861 --> 00:41:06,385
Hey!

539
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:12,598
They're identical

540
00:41:12,635 --> 00:41:14,159
Aren't I right?

541
00:41:14,237 --> 00:41:16,262
He's right

542
00:41:16,339 --> 00:41:17,966
We can't catch them with these

543
00:41:18,074 --> 00:41:19,871
Sausage!

544
00:41:22,378 --> 00:41:24,107
You're the boss here, right?

545
00:41:25,882 --> 00:41:28,112
You still call me Sausage

546
00:41:28,484 --> 00:41:32,045
And no one calls me boss here
in this tiny bar

547
00:41:32,689 --> 00:41:37,183
Sang gets 67.2%

548
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:39,785
and I get only 32.8%

549
00:41:39,863 --> 00:41:42,195
You call 500 square meters tiny?

550
00:41:42,966 --> 00:41:47,232
Underage girls and fake whisky,
it's all illegal

551
00:41:47,303 --> 00:41:51,364
Be careful And never say
that we can't catch someone!

552
00:41:51,441 --> 00:41:54,638
How many boys do you have?

553
00:41:54,744 --> 00:41:57,269
I think there are roughly 100

554
00:41:57,347 --> 00:41:58,974
Flatfish, what about you?

555
00:41:59,082 --> 00:42:02,540
Less than 11, excluding school boys

556
00:42:02,952 --> 00:42:07,480
No kidding. You have more than
50 in the restaurant

557
00:42:07,557 --> 00:42:10,185
They're not mine anymore

558
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:13,754
Sang took them back two months ago

559
00:42:13,863 --> 00:42:16,161
You little rat

560
00:42:17,233 --> 00:42:20,532
What would they be doing now?

561
00:42:20,904 --> 00:42:24,431
Horse racing, massage, billiards,

562
00:42:24,641 --> 00:42:27,667
drinking and fucking

563
00:42:28,077 --> 00:42:29,772
That's it!

564
00:42:29,979 --> 00:42:32,641
Don't even think about
doing business now

565
00:42:32,849 --> 00:42:35,409
Club guards, waiters, everyone!

566
00:42:35,485 --> 00:42:39,649
Track down every single one
with a new face

567
00:42:39,856 --> 00:42:43,792
This case was probably done by

568
00:42:45,261 --> 00:42:47,320
either you or your boys

569
00:42:47,430 --> 00:42:51,662
Detective! Robbery is a profession

570
00:42:51,901 --> 00:42:55,701
We do it, but with discipline

571
00:42:55,805 --> 00:42:58,740
Professional robbers wait for

572
00:42:58,942 --> 00:43:05,177
victims to sit, lie down

573
00:43:05,315 --> 00:43:07,613
and fall asleep

574
00:43:07,817 --> 00:43:11,378
Robbers who wait are the professionals

575
00:43:11,487 --> 00:43:14,650
Like you? How nice

576
00:43:15,591 --> 00:43:20,255
Report to me every 3 hours and find
something within a week. Got it?

577
00:43:21,230 --> 00:43:26,634
Detectives, why are you bothering

578
00:43:27,937 --> 00:43:30,201
hard working boys like us?

579
00:43:33,643 --> 00:43:37,477
Oh my god!
Call everyone and get this moving!

580
00:44:15,952 --> 00:44:18,887
Are you a fuckin' pro or what?

581
00:44:18,955 --> 00:44:21,287
Damn it!

582
00:44:21,524 --> 00:44:24,186
You faked your average score

583
00:44:24,761 --> 00:44:26,251
Aren't you going to play anymore?

584
00:44:26,362 --> 00:44:28,262
Think you were me

585
00:44:28,398 --> 00:44:31,492
Would you want to play with
someone who lies?

586
00:44:31,734 --> 00:44:35,431
- I didn't lie
- You didn't? Fucking liar!

587
00:44:37,373 --> 00:44:41,503
How could I lose 6 times in a row!
You bastard!

588
00:44:41,811 --> 00:44:45,747
I told you to behave in my place!

589
00:44:47,784 --> 00:44:51,117
Look bro, he cheated us

590
00:44:51,454 --> 00:44:53,445
I lost 500,000 without winning once

591
00:44:53,589 --> 00:44:54,749
What?

592
00:44:54,824 --> 00:44:57,691
Damn it

593
00:45:04,467 --> 00:45:07,903
Hey Minki! Long time no see

594
00:45:08,237 --> 00:45:12,435
You look good with that nice jacket!

595
00:45:12,842 --> 00:45:16,107
Not a tout anymore, huh

596
00:45:16,512 --> 00:45:19,310
Still having fun at the horse races?

597
00:45:19,715 --> 00:45:21,182
Who is he?

598
00:45:21,284 --> 00:45:23,548
A friend of mine

599
00:45:23,686 --> 00:45:26,621
Look who you're playing with!

600
00:45:27,723 --> 00:45:30,419
Don't come around my neighborhood

601
00:45:31,194 --> 00:45:34,493
I'll break your skull. Got it?

602
00:45:35,465 --> 00:45:36,762
Get out of here!

603
00:45:37,834 --> 00:45:39,893
What are you looking at, asshole?

604
00:45:59,522 --> 00:46:03,390
This damn picture looks like everyone

605
00:46:05,695 --> 00:46:07,356
You know him?

606
00:46:07,497 --> 00:46:09,897
He was a manager when I was a tout

607
00:46:09,932 --> 00:46:11,524
Gonna let them walk away?

608
00:46:11,601 --> 00:46:13,432
Let's beat up the motherfuckers

609
00:46:13,536 --> 00:46:15,731
Are you scared? Should I do it?

610
00:46:15,905 --> 00:46:18,305
Enough. Stop it

611
00:46:18,407 --> 00:46:20,932
You're scared. Aren't you?

612
00:46:22,278 --> 00:46:25,213
Afraid of those chickens?
How embarrassing

613
00:46:29,185 --> 00:46:33,019
If I want to beat them up, I will

614
00:46:35,858 --> 00:46:37,325
Understand?

615
00:47:01,584 --> 00:47:04,314
Return that 38 Special and
get a 22 caliber pistol

616
00:47:04,921 --> 00:47:08,322
A 22 caliber is a toy.
It only leaves scratches!

617
00:47:09,926 --> 00:47:12,986
I'll shoot when I have to

618
00:47:13,129 --> 00:47:16,189
I'll even follow all the rules

619
00:47:16,332 --> 00:47:18,197
A legal shooting

620
00:47:18,401 --> 00:47:19,925
Fool!

621
00:47:20,036 --> 00:47:21,435
Hey, bro!

622
00:47:22,171 --> 00:47:26,665
It wouldn't be that bad if we didn't
have to do this stakeout, right?

623
00:47:26,742 --> 00:47:28,266
C'mon

624
00:47:28,711 --> 00:47:30,201
Where you going?

625
00:47:30,346 --> 00:47:31,904
To shit

626
00:47:32,181 --> 00:47:35,116
This is when criminals appear

627
00:47:35,184 --> 00:47:38,017
They always appear
when you're alone

628
00:47:38,187 --> 00:47:40,519
I'm leaving so they'd appear

629
00:47:43,993 --> 00:47:45,722
It's so annoying

630
00:47:45,828 --> 00:47:50,026
Are we going to listen to
A Million Roses a million times?

631
00:48:22,131 --> 00:48:24,031
Damn it!

632
00:48:46,689 --> 00:48:51,183
You have the right to remain silent and

633
00:48:56,966 --> 00:48:58,456
Who are you?

634
00:48:58,534 --> 00:49:00,297
Who are you?

635
00:49:00,603 --> 00:49:02,070
Police

636
00:49:02,204 --> 00:49:03,899
I'm a police, too

637
00:49:04,273 --> 00:49:06,605
- Hands off him
- You gotta be kidding

638
00:49:08,177 --> 00:49:09,838
Let's cuff him first and talk

639
00:49:09,912 --> 00:49:11,311
All right

640
00:49:14,150 --> 00:49:17,950
Am I Jesus or what?

641
00:49:19,588 --> 00:49:21,055
Where are you from?

642
00:49:21,190 --> 00:49:22,555
Gwacheon district

643
00:49:22,625 --> 00:49:24,252
If it's not a problem,
give him to me

644
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:26,385
That's impossible

645
00:49:27,697 --> 00:49:29,665
I'm a 116th graduate You?

646
00:49:34,503 --> 00:49:36,198
Then you're 12 years junior to me

647
00:49:36,305 --> 00:49:38,830
This isn't a military.
That's not important

648
00:49:39,475 --> 00:49:42,569
- Hey!
- Don't be so rude!

649
00:49:44,013 --> 00:49:47,141
- Are you testing my temper?
- Make my day. Go ahead and hit me!

650
00:49:47,450 --> 00:49:49,008
What's going on?

651
00:49:49,518 --> 00:49:52,510
- Detective OH!
- Hey KIM!

652
00:49:52,588 --> 00:49:54,783
I heard you transferred to
Gwacheon district

653
00:49:54,924 --> 00:49:58,382
- Yes Is this fellow your wife?
- Yeah, why?

654
00:49:59,362 --> 00:50:04,061
Brother, pass that bastard on to me

655
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:05,929
I'll pay you back

656
00:50:06,035 --> 00:50:08,526
- Does he have a record?
- 4 convictions for mugging

657
00:50:08,637 --> 00:50:11,105
Why are you alone?
Where's your wife?

658
00:50:11,173 --> 00:50:14,609
He's been hospitalized because of
this bastard

659
00:50:14,710 --> 00:50:19,807
I was after him for 3 months

660
00:50:20,249 --> 00:50:23,377
3 months or 30 years,
it makes no difference. No is no

661
00:50:23,819 --> 00:50:28,085
I beg you
I'll pay you back

662
00:50:28,491 --> 00:50:31,619
I'll never need your help.
This is nonsense

663
00:50:32,995 --> 00:50:35,190
Come on, bro!

664
00:50:35,798 --> 00:50:37,698
Can't you do something?

665
00:51:07,563 --> 00:51:11,260
What are you going to say?

666
00:51:11,667 --> 00:51:14,761
Hand him over?
I'd do anything I'd sell my house

667
00:51:14,870 --> 00:51:18,203
if you need money. But not this

668
00:51:20,142 --> 00:51:23,578
I'm not doing this for the score

669
00:51:28,884 --> 00:51:31,250
Don't mix public and private affairs!

670
00:51:53,476 --> 00:51:55,876
Your fate belongs to Gwacheon

671
00:52:18,067 --> 00:52:21,434
- Can't we eat something else?
- What?

672
00:52:21,971 --> 00:52:24,462
Chinese noodles?

673
00:52:24,874 --> 00:52:28,241
- It's too late for orders
- You just wait

674
00:52:32,581 --> 00:52:36,017
Is that you? I haven't seen you
for a long time

675
00:52:36,385 --> 00:52:39,946
I'm not busy at all.
I'm bored now

676
00:52:40,189 --> 00:52:42,316
Where?

677
00:52:42,992 --> 00:52:46,553
Stakeout?

678
00:52:46,795 --> 00:52:49,229
Of course

679
00:52:49,398 --> 00:52:52,765
I'll be there without god knowing

680
00:52:53,002 --> 00:52:55,061
Where are you?

681
00:52:58,974 --> 00:53:02,774
That's too far

682
00:53:03,012 --> 00:53:06,573
Not that I don't want to go

683
00:53:06,615 --> 00:53:10,107
The noodles will swell!

684
00:53:10,486 --> 00:53:13,148
Oh No! Detective!

685
00:53:16,392 --> 00:53:18,519
Damn it!

686
00:53:18,928 --> 00:53:23,456
How could he do this to me
just because he got me a job!

687
00:53:28,237 --> 00:53:30,637
An attack is the best defense

688
00:53:31,173 --> 00:53:33,539
Everyone has a skeleton
in his closet

689
00:53:33,742 --> 00:53:37,576
He that will steal a pin
will steal an ox

690
00:53:38,047 --> 00:53:40,709
After a storm comes a calm

691
00:53:41,650 --> 00:53:45,586
Mend the barn
after the horse is stolen

692
00:53:46,255 --> 00:53:49,122
They that know nothing fear nothing

693
00:53:51,827 --> 00:53:54,318
The end justifies the means

694
00:53:55,497 --> 00:53:57,897
Opportunity makes the thief

695
00:53:59,635 --> 00:54:01,432
What's that?

696
00:54:21,423 --> 00:54:23,550
- Delivery!
- What the hell are you doing?

697
00:54:25,227 --> 00:54:27,559
- You're on a stakeout
- Where's the food?

698
00:54:27,963 --> 00:54:30,796
I changed it to fried rice
because noodles swell

699
00:54:30,933 --> 00:54:32,525
Ok

700
00:54:33,068 --> 00:54:34,592
Here it is

701
00:54:35,004 --> 00:54:36,369
Delivery!

702
00:54:39,608 --> 00:54:41,098
What?

703
00:54:41,143 --> 00:54:43,134
Leave the dishes under the car

704
00:54:43,245 --> 00:54:45,406
I'll pick them up without god knowing

705
00:54:47,082 --> 00:54:48,447
Delivery!

706
00:54:53,222 --> 00:54:56,055
How are you going to work with
such an unreliable source?

707
00:55:01,530 --> 00:55:02,997
Hello?

708
00:55:03,098 --> 00:55:07,535
Horse racing, massage, going through
money like water. Four of them

709
00:55:07,703 --> 00:55:11,264
My boys caught them running
after committing an assault

710
00:55:26,055 --> 00:55:27,545
Well done

711
00:55:27,756 --> 00:55:32,989
Took care of them so they wouldn't
hurt themselves

712
00:55:43,872 --> 00:55:46,272
- Hey, Sang-chun
- Yeah?

713
00:55:47,009 --> 00:55:50,706
- Good job but
- Don't mention it...

714
00:55:50,879 --> 00:55:54,076
You don't have to say anything

715
00:55:54,249 --> 00:55:58,447
I'll do anything for you

716
00:56:00,022 --> 00:56:04,152
I'll arrest you for imitating
a government official

717
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:08,087
if you impersonate a police officer
once again. Understand?

718
00:56:09,231 --> 00:56:10,892
I'll keep that in mind

719
00:56:14,870 --> 00:56:16,804
Don't do this again

720
00:56:17,272 --> 00:56:19,399
I'll kill you for overdoing it

721
00:56:22,311 --> 00:56:23,972
Turn around

722
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:26,513
Close your eyes

723
00:56:26,815 --> 00:56:28,646
I'll poke out your eyeballs
if you open them

724
00:56:28,784 --> 00:56:30,274
Turn around!

725
00:56:39,728 --> 00:56:41,525
They're not the ones

726
00:56:41,730 --> 00:56:43,891
No?

727
00:56:47,302 --> 00:56:50,863
Boss, are you going to let them
treat us like this?

728
00:56:50,906 --> 00:56:55,536
We're starving to death
by not focusing on our business

729
00:56:55,644 --> 00:56:58,807
Let's dump them in the sea

730
00:56:58,914 --> 00:57:01,508
or bury them alive

731
00:57:01,650 --> 00:57:03,709
You don't know
what you are talking about

732
00:57:03,786 --> 00:57:05,549
Do you know who Young-dahl is?

733
00:57:05,621 --> 00:57:07,555
Remember the Regent Snatcher?

734
00:57:07,790 --> 00:57:13,592
They destroyed 2 stolen goods storages
with a bulldozer because of my help

735
00:57:14,129 --> 00:57:15,653
Really?

736
00:57:15,764 --> 00:57:17,356
Really

737
00:57:25,908 --> 00:57:27,375
I wonder

738
00:57:28,343 --> 00:57:30,777
how did you two meet?

739
00:57:31,046 --> 00:57:33,412
Us? You won't believe it

740
00:57:33,949 --> 00:57:37,407
I am still furious

741
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:40,218
when I think about him

742
00:57:40,355 --> 00:57:44,416
playing a trick on me

743
00:57:45,127 --> 00:57:47,118
What do you mean?

744
00:57:47,362 --> 00:57:52,561
When we were going out
he said he was an ethics teacher

745
00:57:52,768 --> 00:57:53,996
What?

746
00:57:54,403 --> 00:58:00,205
Jay! My daughter was this small
and now she's this big

747
00:58:00,809 --> 00:58:05,576
Who measures height sideways?
People measure it vertically

748
00:58:05,881 --> 00:58:10,011
It's because he only sees
her when she's asleep

749
00:58:11,753 --> 00:58:14,745
Anyway, do you know BANG Gyusik?

750
00:58:15,457 --> 00:58:16,981
BANG Gyusik?

751
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:21,396
He must have been released...
Why?

752
00:58:21,997 --> 00:58:25,091
He calls everyday talking
all kinds of nonsense

753
00:58:25,467 --> 00:58:30,200
I get lots of phone calls
but this one's the dirtiest

754
00:58:30,572 --> 00:58:32,665
What was he in for?

755
00:58:32,875 --> 00:58:35,810
He was in for
mugging about three or four times

756
00:58:37,012 --> 00:58:41,574
Well, they should be in until they die

757
00:58:43,051 --> 00:58:45,178
You get those kind of calls?

758
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:48,182
Are you kidding?
It's a monthly event

759
00:58:51,226 --> 00:58:52,625
Let's go

760
00:58:55,998 --> 00:58:57,659
Good-bye

761
00:58:58,267 --> 00:59:00,758
- See you
- Take care

762
00:59:10,012 --> 00:59:13,379
- I'm worried to hear that
- Why?

763
00:59:13,649 --> 00:59:17,141
My wife will suffer from
those bastards too

764
00:59:17,352 --> 00:59:22,255
They cry and threaten to leave
you, but after a while

765
00:59:22,424 --> 00:59:25,086
they talk back dirty to them

766
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:27,726
She does?

767
00:59:39,674 --> 00:59:42,868
Jay, do something tonight

768
00:59:42,711 --> 00:59:46,405
- I think I should
- Here she comes

769
00:59:49,778 --> 00:59:52,106
Why are you hiding?
Did you do something wrong?

770
00:59:53,949 --> 00:59:57,578
Who's hiding?
Hurry and go talk to her, boy

771
00:59:57,854 --> 01:00:00,750
Good luck, jay-soo!

772
01:00:01,223 --> 01:00:03,987
- Thanks ethics teacher
- What?

773
01:00:07,596 --> 01:00:08,927
Salute!

774
01:00:09,031 --> 01:00:11,966
I'm random checking
passers by ID please

775
01:00:12,067 --> 01:00:16,504
Nana KANG
58-2 Sinsa-Dong Kangnam Seoul

776
01:00:17,339 --> 01:00:20,740
Thank you for your cooperation.
Salute!

777
01:00:21,710 --> 01:00:23,575
Wait a sec

778
01:00:25,047 --> 01:00:28,175
Thank you for your cooperation

779
01:00:40,296 --> 01:00:41,888
Hey

780
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:47,967
You didn't have to throw them away!

781
01:00:48,170 --> 01:00:52,732
The flowers are innocent.
Why did you do that?

782
01:00:54,209 --> 01:00:56,871
Answer me!

783
01:01:02,618 --> 01:01:07,612
Women who hate flowers
are not women

784
01:01:07,790 --> 01:01:10,987
People say not to ever get
close to them

785
01:01:14,063 --> 01:01:19,660
Flowers are hearts and
hearts are flowers, you know?

786
01:01:29,044 --> 01:01:33,845
I said don't get close to women
who hate flowers and you

787
01:01:33,949 --> 01:01:37,282
should've said Don't get close
to me then

788
01:01:37,519 --> 01:01:39,111
Can't you talk back?

789
01:01:39,788 --> 01:01:43,781
The Stone Age didn't end because
all the stones disappeared

790
01:01:43,892 --> 01:01:46,554
Use your stone brain!
Why am I here with flowers?

791
01:01:46,729 --> 01:01:49,027
I just want to talk to you

792
01:01:52,534 --> 01:01:58,905
You are more stubborn than
a telemarketer

793
01:01:59,174 --> 01:02:01,836
Look! You are as hard as iron

794
01:02:02,244 --> 01:02:04,838
There is fungus around your mouth!

795
01:02:13,322 --> 01:02:15,256
- What is this?
- I'm a police

796
01:02:18,193 --> 01:02:20,024
Shut your fucking mouth

797
01:02:20,095 --> 01:02:22,290
Police are not iron men

798
01:04:42,304 --> 01:04:44,067
What do you think of them?

799
01:04:44,273 --> 01:04:46,741
- Don't they look cheap?
- I thought so!

800
01:04:47,442 --> 01:04:52,106
They seem to have some money.
Once cheap, always cheap

801
01:04:52,381 --> 01:04:56,841
This place is losing its flavor.
We'll be ruined too

802
01:04:57,319 --> 01:04:59,583
Let's go after a while

803
01:05:08,564 --> 01:05:10,293
Thanks, honey

804
01:05:13,835 --> 01:05:16,360
By the way, what do you do?

805
01:05:16,538 --> 01:05:20,099
You look like a spender,
but not a gentleman

806
01:05:20,175 --> 01:05:21,767
Take a guess!

807
01:05:24,680 --> 01:05:28,548
Frankly, you don't look that
upright... like um...

808
01:05:28,617 --> 01:05:32,815
- Fucking whore, you talk like a bitch
- What? A whore?

809
01:05:33,722 --> 01:05:37,385
Now you're showing your real colors!
Hey, let's go

810
01:05:40,796 --> 01:05:42,957
Who are these assholes?

811
01:05:46,835 --> 01:05:48,598
Fuck you

812
01:05:49,838 --> 01:05:52,807
I knew you were assholes

813
01:05:53,275 --> 01:05:55,368
What are you doing?
I said let's go!

814
01:06:00,249 --> 01:06:04,276
Bitch! Slut! Whore!

815
01:06:05,354 --> 01:06:07,254
Stop it

816
01:06:09,224 --> 01:06:12,625
- Fucking whore!
- You're gonna kill her

817
01:06:21,503 --> 01:06:23,334
Shut your fucking mouth!

818
01:06:31,813 --> 01:06:34,646
She has so much money!

819
01:06:35,050 --> 01:06:38,178
Don't kill me.
Here's my card

820
01:06:38,420 --> 01:06:40,911
The pin code is 8274.
Take them all

821
01:06:41,023 --> 01:06:42,615
- 8274?
- Yes

822
01:06:42,758 --> 01:06:46,455
Thanks.
But don't you wanna play?

823
01:06:47,396 --> 01:06:49,455
- Don't kill me
- Shake

824
01:06:49,531 --> 01:06:52,022
- Shake!
- Please don't kill me

825
01:06:52,100 --> 01:06:54,330
Minki! What are you doing?
Play the music!

826
01:06:54,636 --> 01:06:57,070
Don't kill me.
Don't kill me, please

827
01:06:57,439 --> 01:07:00,203
You fucking whore!
I told you to dance not beg!

828
01:07:00,309 --> 01:07:03,676
I'll do anything,
please don't kill me. Please

829
01:07:03,712 --> 01:07:07,045
- Get up you fucking whore
- Soochang!

830
01:07:07,149 --> 01:07:09,117
She's begging you

831
01:07:13,455 --> 01:07:15,582
- You wanna live?
- Yes

832
01:07:17,893 --> 01:07:19,656
Bring the microphone

833
01:07:26,635 --> 01:07:28,364
I'll spare your life if you score
more than 90

834
01:07:28,637 --> 01:07:30,366
I can't sing

835
01:07:31,740 --> 01:07:33,674
I can't...

836
01:07:34,109 --> 01:07:36,543
Sing if you don't want to die

837
01:07:36,878 --> 01:07:38,573
Push any number

838
01:07:52,828 --> 01:07:56,696
Hey, what are you hesitating for?

839
01:07:56,765 --> 01:07:59,063
I know that you want me

840
01:07:59,167 --> 01:08:01,692
I know what you want

841
01:08:01,803 --> 01:08:06,206
Come here, don't wait

842
01:08:06,308 --> 01:08:10,642
I was waiting for you

843
01:08:19,688 --> 01:08:24,716
I closed my eyes

844
01:08:24,793 --> 01:08:29,093
and waited for you

845
01:08:29,164 --> 01:08:35,125
So I could feel your love

846
01:08:41,410 --> 01:08:42,900
Let's go

847
01:08:44,379 --> 01:08:46,779
Today's your fucking lucky day

848
01:08:47,048 --> 01:08:49,915
Thank you. Thank you

849
01:09:20,215 --> 01:09:24,914
You can't run if you don't stretch

850
01:09:25,053 --> 01:09:28,614
during the stakeout

851
01:09:29,124 --> 01:09:32,753
Don't worry. I'm still quick

852
01:09:44,739 --> 01:09:47,469
Hey, partner!

853
01:09:47,676 --> 01:09:49,769
- What?
- Did you see that?

854
01:09:51,279 --> 01:09:53,110
Look at those bastards

855
01:09:53,215 --> 01:09:54,876
What should we do?
Should we get them?

856
01:09:55,050 --> 01:09:59,180
Are you nuts?
We can't handle four. Wait

857
01:10:03,258 --> 01:10:05,556
Young-dahl, it's Chil-sun

858
01:10:05,694 --> 01:10:09,892
Four? Be careful while tailing
I'll be right there

859
01:10:32,187 --> 01:10:35,213
I'm at the intersection. Where?

860
01:10:37,125 --> 01:10:39,559
I see them. Ok

861
01:10:57,045 --> 01:10:58,740
Don't look back

862
01:10:59,014 --> 01:11:03,280
The pigs are following.
They're police. Pretend you didn't notice

863
01:11:05,020 --> 01:11:06,988
There are two more in front of us

864
01:11:12,093 --> 01:11:13,424
Run!

865
01:11:13,495 --> 01:11:14,723
Get him!

866
01:11:43,091 --> 01:11:44,490
Shit!

867
01:11:49,598 --> 01:11:50,997
Freeze!

868
01:11:52,901 --> 01:11:54,459
You asshole!

869
01:12:11,653 --> 01:12:13,382
Get him!

870
01:12:36,378 --> 01:12:38,938
Put that away.
There are people here

871
01:13:11,212 --> 01:13:13,077
Someone call an ambulance

872
01:13:15,550 --> 01:13:18,075
It's stuffy. I can't breathe

873
01:13:19,220 --> 01:13:22,849
Don't move. If I pull it out,
you will die from loss of blood

874
01:13:22,924 --> 01:13:25,358
You'll live

875
01:13:25,460 --> 01:13:26,984
Just hold on

876
01:13:53,354 --> 01:13:55,345
Myung-hwan! What happened?

877
01:13:56,357 --> 01:13:57,984
You missed them?

878
01:13:58,393 --> 01:14:00,691
- Shit!
- OK

879
01:14:02,330 --> 01:14:05,322
I could have caught him.
Why didn't you let me shoot him?

880
01:14:05,467 --> 01:14:09,062
You don't know who he was. You can't
just shoot someone because he is running

881
01:14:09,137 --> 01:14:10,900
He stabbed someone

882
01:14:10,972 --> 01:14:12,701
That was the result

883
01:14:12,774 --> 01:14:15,641
You didn't know that
he'd stab him

884
01:14:15,710 --> 01:14:17,678
- I did
- How?

885
01:14:17,846 --> 01:14:19,108
Intuition

886
01:14:19,247 --> 01:14:23,343
You can handcuff with intuition.
But not shoot, boy

887
01:14:24,052 --> 01:14:25,849
You're not the judge

888
01:14:26,087 --> 01:14:29,716
We just catch and judges will judge

889
01:14:29,858 --> 01:14:32,622
There are rules and steps

890
01:14:33,561 --> 01:14:35,688
Are you prudent? Or afraid?

891
01:14:36,297 --> 01:14:39,630
I heard the bulldozer doesn't
care what he's bulldozing!

892
01:14:39,734 --> 01:14:42,294
Damn! Where's your outrage!

893
01:14:43,605 --> 01:14:46,130
How do you think you'd feel
after shooting someone to death?

894
01:14:47,442 --> 01:14:50,036
It feels like shit to run over a dog

895
01:14:50,111 --> 01:14:52,102
And this is a man

896
01:14:52,247 --> 01:14:54,545
Do you think I was dancing
after I shot him?

897
01:15:07,262 --> 01:15:09,196
I found it at the scene

898
01:15:27,515 --> 01:15:29,312
Damn it!

899
01:15:52,774 --> 01:15:54,833
You can't remember anything?

900
01:15:55,844 --> 01:15:57,368
You're here

901
01:16:01,282 --> 01:16:02,681
- You're late
- Yeah

902
01:16:02,717 --> 01:16:03,911
That's not our ID Team

903
01:16:04,018 --> 01:16:06,316
Due to the serial murders,
I asked for the Municipal ID Team

904
01:16:06,421 --> 01:16:08,446
- What's the result?
- They're still working on it

905
01:16:08,556 --> 01:16:10,387
Check the bodies

906
01:16:10,625 --> 01:16:13,093
There's nothing to verify their ID

907
01:16:14,462 --> 01:16:17,795
We should perform a ritual
or something

908
01:16:17,899 --> 01:16:19,560
You can say that again

909
01:16:20,101 --> 01:16:21,796
Turn off the lights, please

910
01:16:27,408 --> 01:16:29,137
No special traces

911
01:16:29,244 --> 01:16:30,905
They cleaned up everything

912
01:16:31,212 --> 01:16:32,770
Turn it on, please

913
01:16:40,722 --> 01:16:44,214
- Long time no see, Mr. OH
- Long time no see indeed

914
01:16:44,592 --> 01:16:46,890
The Municipal ID Team
has appeared

915
01:16:52,767 --> 01:16:54,496
Find anything?

916
01:16:55,036 --> 01:16:58,597
Found few footprints
but that's it

917
01:16:58,840 --> 01:17:00,171
Really?

918
01:17:04,045 --> 01:17:07,776
Looks like she was hit
by a bottle

919
01:17:12,921 --> 01:17:14,684
Get the fingerprints

920
01:17:16,357 --> 01:17:17,984
Is this related?

921
01:17:18,192 --> 01:17:20,660
We will see

922
01:17:22,196 --> 01:17:24,494
- Take the fingerprints please
- Yeah

923
01:17:26,935 --> 01:17:31,133
We can't verify ID
because there's no belongings

924
01:17:31,606 --> 01:17:33,471
- Really?
- Yes

925
01:17:33,541 --> 01:17:35,907
I'll get the fingerprints now

926
01:17:36,077 --> 01:17:37,772
Who'll come along?

927
01:17:44,986 --> 01:17:47,454
Sergeant KANG Nana

928
01:18:00,768 --> 01:18:02,531
No smoking

929
01:18:04,906 --> 01:18:07,807
You shouldn't have followed them

930
01:18:08,443 --> 01:18:11,571
You're not Superman and

931
01:18:11,779 --> 01:18:14,179
it's not smart to fight with four

932
01:18:17,652 --> 01:18:19,779
There's fungus around your mouth

933
01:18:22,890 --> 01:18:24,482
You can smoke

934
01:18:27,295 --> 01:18:29,820
It must've been funny for you
in many ways

935
01:18:39,374 --> 01:18:41,433
Your fingers are rigid

936
01:18:43,712 --> 01:18:48,172
I know it's difficult for you
but please help

937
01:18:50,986 --> 01:18:53,011
It must've been hard for you

938
01:18:53,655 --> 01:18:56,488
The most terrible moment in your life

939
01:18:57,359 --> 01:19:00,385
They hit you like it was a game

940
01:19:00,796 --> 01:19:03,424
I know. They are fucking assholes!

941
01:19:04,633 --> 01:19:08,000
They say that society abandoned them

942
01:19:08,670 --> 01:19:12,504
but they're just cowards

943
01:19:19,514 --> 01:19:23,780
You didn't deserve
anything like this

944
01:19:28,090 --> 01:19:31,116
You see that man over there?

945
01:19:31,793 --> 01:19:35,456
He doesn't look that reliable but

946
01:19:35,630 --> 01:19:37,894
he'll catch the criminals for you

947
01:19:48,777 --> 01:19:53,043
Wasn't it ridiculous?
For a squirt like me...

948
01:19:54,116 --> 01:19:57,176
- to ask for a date
- I heard that

949
01:19:57,753 --> 01:19:59,687
the veterans talk to the corpses

950
01:19:59,755 --> 01:20:03,088
when the cases aren't going well

951
01:20:04,259 --> 01:20:06,022
I'm not that advanced yet

952
01:20:06,328 --> 01:20:08,057
I have so many things to
learn and do

953
01:20:10,499 --> 01:20:14,458
So I'm not interested in dating

954
01:20:18,473 --> 01:20:20,031
I'm sorry

955
01:20:57,579 --> 01:20:59,069
Nice job

956
01:20:59,548 --> 01:21:00,981
Keep it

957
01:21:02,584 --> 01:21:03,949
Dork!

958
01:21:04,019 --> 01:21:06,078
You're excited already

959
01:21:06,721 --> 01:21:10,054
All your money goes to
horse racing

960
01:21:10,192 --> 01:21:12,285
We shouldn't see each
other for a while

961
01:21:12,961 --> 01:21:16,124
Be careful and don't call each other

962
01:21:17,799 --> 01:21:19,767
I'll call you

963
01:21:19,868 --> 01:21:22,860
Police are supposed to enforce
the law, not judge under it

964
01:21:23,405 --> 01:21:25,839
We should refrain from using

965
01:21:26,107 --> 01:21:29,440
guns as much as possible

966
01:21:31,813 --> 01:21:34,976
The human rights organizations are

967
01:21:35,016 --> 01:21:38,645
sensitive about excessive force

968
01:21:39,087 --> 01:21:42,579
Disciplinary action will be taken
after some proper procedures

969
01:21:44,359 --> 01:21:46,793
When I was new,
the veterans told me that

970
01:21:47,462 --> 01:21:50,260
Guns are not for shooting,

971
01:21:50,298 --> 01:21:54,291
they're to throw at the criminals

972
01:21:56,304 --> 01:21:59,273
I never thought that'd be true

973
01:22:02,444 --> 01:22:03,968
How did it go?

974
01:22:04,512 --> 01:22:06,707
- Not so good
- And the result is?

975
01:22:07,182 --> 01:22:09,412
- They say they'll report later
- Assholes!

976
01:22:09,851 --> 01:22:11,751
Don't mind them

977
01:22:12,254 --> 01:22:16,452
Yes, sir

978
01:22:17,192 --> 01:22:18,659
Ok! They have the fingerprints!

979
01:22:19,160 --> 01:22:22,493
Chil-sun, check the fingerprints

980
01:22:22,597 --> 01:22:24,326
with the ID team

981
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:26,524
Who, me?

982
01:22:26,768 --> 01:22:28,235
Yeah

983
01:22:28,370 --> 01:22:30,167
I'll go

984
01:22:35,744 --> 01:22:38,975
There are 479 cop couples,

985
01:22:39,014 --> 01:22:41,380
2,394 female officers and

986
01:22:41,483 --> 01:22:44,611
1,302 of them are married.
A little bit more than 50 percent

987
01:22:44,653 --> 01:22:48,350
Do you know the percentage
of cop couples out of this?

988
01:22:48,723 --> 01:22:50,247
I've no idea

989
01:22:55,864 --> 01:22:58,765
I got the photo through the office

990
01:23:00,969 --> 01:23:03,961
Not to make you happy
but because you'd be busy

991
01:23:04,839 --> 01:23:07,535
Ok. Thanks

992
01:23:08,476 --> 01:23:10,706
KIM Minki? Born in 1982?

993
01:23:10,845 --> 01:23:13,245
How did you get his fingerprints?

994
01:23:13,348 --> 01:23:15,578
We had nothing and

995
01:23:15,617 --> 01:23:18,381
I desperately talked with the corps

996
01:23:18,720 --> 01:23:20,915
Then I could get it off her watch

997
01:23:23,158 --> 01:23:25,626
What about the metal ball?

998
01:23:25,694 --> 01:23:27,958
I can't make an ID

999
01:23:28,096 --> 01:23:30,257
You can't?

1000
01:23:30,966 --> 01:23:33,491
The prints are not registered

1001
01:23:35,437 --> 01:23:36,961
I see

1002
01:23:37,205 --> 01:23:41,369
Do you know that one third of

1003
01:23:41,576 --> 01:23:44,977
female cops are married to cops?

1004
01:23:47,382 --> 01:23:49,612
Not with their senior officers

1005
01:23:49,718 --> 01:23:52,448
I bet I'll be the first one

1006
01:24:12,240 --> 01:24:14,708
- Who is this? The criminal?
- Yes

1007
01:24:20,448 --> 01:24:24,043
Don't worry, detective.
My boys are all over this town

1008
01:24:24,185 --> 01:24:27,951
We'll get him immediately
with this picture

1009
01:24:28,056 --> 01:24:30,718
I'll ring you up right away

1010
01:24:30,859 --> 01:24:33,259
- Time is ticking
- I'll keep that it in mind

1011
01:24:36,664 --> 01:24:38,222
Take care!

1012
01:24:39,901 --> 01:24:43,234
- You know this rat?
- Yes

1013
01:24:43,471 --> 01:24:45,996
- Call everyone!
- What for?

1014
01:24:46,708 --> 01:24:48,938
We need to discuss

1015
01:24:49,044 --> 01:24:50,978
what we want in return

1016
01:24:51,079 --> 01:24:52,546
Yes, sir

1017
01:24:54,282 --> 01:24:55,909
Bulldozer

1018
01:24:56,017 --> 01:24:59,453
Jay-soo, pig heads

1019
01:25:14,602 --> 01:25:17,594
KIM Minki Born 1982,

1020
01:25:17,972 --> 01:25:20,566
Parents died in 1994 by car accident

1021
01:25:21,042 --> 01:25:23,704
Lived with an uncle

1022
01:25:25,280 --> 01:25:27,840
Sister died in 1999 from lung cancer

1023
01:25:28,616 --> 01:25:30,208
I'm not sleeping

1024
01:25:35,790 --> 01:25:37,655
How's it going?

1025
01:25:37,926 --> 01:25:40,690
Not so well.
He hasn't come for 6 months

1026
01:25:40,795 --> 01:25:42,524
He wouldn't come here now

1027
01:25:42,597 --> 01:25:44,758
It's been a few days!

1028
01:25:54,709 --> 01:25:56,176
Jay-soo!

1029
01:26:46,327 --> 01:26:48,921
Give me a call

1030
01:26:48,963 --> 01:26:51,830
Look at him! Brother?

1031
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:56,861
I think he has something

1032
01:26:58,339 --> 01:26:59,863
Baccar

1033
01:27:00,708 --> 01:27:02,801
- Genghis Khan
- Fine

1034
01:27:03,011 --> 01:27:04,308
Nobleless

1035
01:27:04,445 --> 01:27:06,436
- I see. Fine
- OK

1036
01:27:06,681 --> 01:27:08,512
Osung Hotel

1037
01:27:08,583 --> 01:27:10,483
Not that one

1038
01:27:10,985 --> 01:27:12,509
Why not?

1039
01:27:12,687 --> 01:27:14,678
Leave that one out

1040
01:27:17,258 --> 01:27:19,249
- I'll see you some other time then
- Hey!

1041
01:27:19,727 --> 01:27:22,218
- What?
- Are you playing with me?

1042
01:27:22,697 --> 01:27:27,157
People should pay for their sins

1043
01:27:27,702 --> 01:27:30,933
You know that better than me.
I'll see you later then

1044
01:27:33,074 --> 01:27:34,769
Hey, Sang-chun!

1045
01:27:34,909 --> 01:27:37,503
I'm a busy man

1046
01:27:37,612 --> 01:27:39,443
I thought we were done

1047
01:27:39,547 --> 01:27:41,344
Come here and sit

1048
01:27:44,485 --> 01:27:46,385
Ok, then

1049
01:27:46,588 --> 01:27:48,488
I see

1050
01:27:54,896 --> 01:27:57,626
Give me your detective book

1051
01:27:58,499 --> 01:28:02,868
I want to tear out the slave papers
with my hands

1052
01:28:02,971 --> 01:28:06,907
Quit it.
I don't want your information

1053
01:28:08,309 --> 01:28:11,836
I'll come back tomorrow with a list of your
criminal acts that haven't been arraigned yet

1054
01:28:11,980 --> 01:28:13,709
Let's go!

1055
01:28:16,851 --> 01:28:19,115
As you wish

1056
01:28:24,759 --> 01:28:26,351
Boss!

1057
01:28:30,164 --> 01:28:32,928
What are you doing?

1058
01:28:33,034 --> 01:28:35,059
They're all gone

1059
01:28:36,371 --> 01:28:38,271
- Are they really gone?
- Yes

1060
01:28:38,473 --> 01:28:41,237
Hurry up, dummies!
Go get them!

1061
01:28:41,342 --> 01:28:43,742
- Don't blame it on me!
- Hurry up

1062
01:28:48,049 --> 01:28:49,812
Sick bastard

1063
01:28:50,218 --> 01:28:54,382
You're guilty of so many sins!

1064
01:28:55,089 --> 01:28:57,080
No. Not that one

1065
01:28:57,258 --> 01:28:59,749
Cases can't be crossed out
without the victim's consent

1066
01:29:01,462 --> 01:29:03,623
Yes, sir. I understand

1067
01:29:04,766 --> 01:29:06,529
Cross out 2 more

1068
01:29:08,736 --> 01:29:11,170
Thank you. I appreciate it

1069
01:29:12,807 --> 01:29:14,707
Where's KIM Minki?

1070
01:30:27,915 --> 01:30:29,610
Chil-soon!

1071
01:30:36,057 --> 01:30:37,820
What the hell?

1072
01:30:38,025 --> 01:30:39,822
Get away asshole!

1073
01:30:50,571 --> 01:30:52,368
What were you thinking?

1074
01:30:55,977 --> 01:30:57,501
Damn it!

1075
01:31:14,796 --> 01:31:17,128
Let me go! God damn it!

1076
01:31:17,498 --> 01:31:19,090
Let me go!

1077
01:31:51,566 --> 01:31:53,534
Go! Go!

1078
01:32:19,460 --> 01:32:20,984
Asshole!

1079
01:32:28,569 --> 01:32:30,230
Are you ok?

1080
01:32:46,888 --> 01:32:49,356
When are you going to
do something?

1081
01:32:52,727 --> 01:32:54,627
What are you doing, you bastard?

1082
01:32:57,365 --> 01:33:00,027
Can't you see that
the lieutenant is hurt?

1083
01:33:05,339 --> 01:33:08,866
How come you're always
on his side?

1084
01:33:13,481 --> 01:33:15,039
Jay-soo

1085
01:33:18,452 --> 01:33:20,079
Jay-soo!

1086
01:33:20,855 --> 01:33:22,720
I know you're smart and brave

1087
01:33:23,791 --> 01:33:25,383
Chil-sun!

1088
01:33:26,227 --> 01:33:28,752
Do it right if you want respect!

1089
01:33:31,499 --> 01:33:33,626
I'll tell you one thing

1090
01:33:34,335 --> 01:33:37,702
Everyone has to share the blade's
cuts to survive

1091
01:33:38,940 --> 01:33:40,430
Remember that!

1092
01:33:47,882 --> 01:33:50,942
Me, the lieutenant and detective
MA went in the motel to

1093
01:33:51,118 --> 01:33:53,552
catch the Doobong gangsters,
and the hallway was curved

1094
01:33:54,021 --> 01:33:57,821
like this, this and this

1095
01:34:00,161 --> 01:34:02,061
I had a weird feeling

1096
01:34:02,196 --> 01:34:03,959
But what could I do?

1097
01:34:04,599 --> 01:34:07,193
As we went in, something struck us

1098
01:34:08,369 --> 01:34:12,567
MA was stabbed in the side,

1099
01:34:13,140 --> 01:34:15,870
and I got a sashimi knife in my thigh

1100
01:34:16,010 --> 01:34:17,637
I heard a crunching noise,

1101
01:34:17,745 --> 01:34:20,179
the bone was cracking

1102
01:34:21,415 --> 01:34:23,406
Damn it!

1103
01:34:25,920 --> 01:34:29,720
The main artery was cut
and blood was spurting out

1104
01:34:30,358 --> 01:34:32,883
Lieutenant tried everything

1105
01:34:32,994 --> 01:34:35,292
but it wouldn't stop

1106
01:34:38,966 --> 01:34:41,093
I thought I was dying

1107
01:34:44,071 --> 01:34:46,505
Detective MA died on the spot

1108
01:34:46,641 --> 01:34:49,439
I made it because of the lieutenant,

1109
01:34:50,077 --> 01:34:54,138
but my hands tremble

1110
01:34:54,715 --> 01:34:57,013
even when I see a toy knife now

1111
01:35:00,154 --> 01:35:02,349
It's so fucking embarrassing

1112
01:35:10,097 --> 01:35:12,258
It's time to quit

1113
01:35:15,136 --> 01:35:19,334
What's our secret weapon?

1114
01:35:21,709 --> 01:35:23,506
Our bodies

1115
01:35:24,345 --> 01:35:27,246
immortal bodies

1116
01:35:28,015 --> 01:35:29,915
What can we do?

1117
01:35:30,084 --> 01:35:31,881
We have to get over it

1118
01:35:57,712 --> 01:35:59,373
Look!

1119
01:36:00,314 --> 01:36:02,373
You see those kids?

1120
01:36:02,550 --> 01:36:04,040
They're orphans now

1121
01:36:04,151 --> 01:36:06,517
You won't talk

1122
01:36:07,988 --> 01:36:09,785
Right, you'll never talk

1123
01:36:10,091 --> 01:36:12,616
You are a faithful friend

1124
01:36:12,693 --> 01:36:14,684
Faithful friends never talk

1125
01:36:14,762 --> 01:36:16,855
Don't talk. Never talk!

1126
01:36:16,931 --> 01:36:18,899
I'll kill you if you talk!

1127
01:36:22,236 --> 01:36:23,863
Son of bitch

1128
01:36:26,674 --> 01:36:28,369
Sit down

1129
01:36:30,678 --> 01:36:32,771
Eat. You must be starving

1130
01:36:35,583 --> 01:36:39,280
What year are they living in.
Such use of violence?

1131
01:36:39,353 --> 01:36:41,878
Such old fellows

1132
01:36:42,623 --> 01:36:45,558
Relax and eat

1133
01:36:48,629 --> 01:36:51,894
You are only 21

1134
01:36:52,800 --> 01:36:55,132
You won't be able to get out
even on your 60th birthday

1135
01:36:55,202 --> 01:36:56,567
Don't you think it's not fair?

1136
01:36:58,405 --> 01:37:01,135
You said you were just
the look-out, right?

1137
01:37:02,643 --> 01:37:04,907
Tell us about the others

1138
01:37:05,045 --> 01:37:08,503
You don't have to bear all the guilt

1139
01:37:11,018 --> 01:37:13,316
- Do you want an egg in it?
- That's ok, sir

1140
01:37:13,420 --> 01:37:14,910
C'mon, eat!

1141
01:37:17,258 --> 01:37:19,624
You can eat eggs everyday
these days

1142
01:37:19,827 --> 01:37:22,125
I don't know about you

1143
01:37:22,429 --> 01:37:24,863
but I envied those who had

1144
01:37:25,432 --> 01:37:28,128
egg rolls in their lunchboxes

1145
01:37:32,473 --> 01:37:36,967
I was 7 and my parents died in
a car accident

1146
01:37:37,311 --> 01:37:39,802
and I lived with my sister

1147
01:37:40,114 --> 01:37:43,845
She delivered newspapers at dawn
and after school she glued dolls' eyes

1148
01:37:44,351 --> 01:37:47,752
She got 10 won per
one fucking eye

1149
01:37:48,689 --> 01:37:51,988
If she glued 600,
she got 6,000 won

1150
01:37:53,761 --> 01:37:57,197
One day I delivered
the dolls with my sister

1151
01:37:58,866 --> 01:38:03,360
One cold winter day

1152
01:38:03,470 --> 01:38:09,705
we delivered the dolls
to the market

1153
01:38:10,377 --> 01:38:13,471
We walked from store to store

1154
01:38:14,248 --> 01:38:16,546
to save on bus fare

1155
01:38:17,518 --> 01:38:19,679
It was cold

1156
01:38:23,123 --> 01:38:25,819
We were starving after walking
so much

1157
01:38:26,360 --> 01:38:28,419
My sister went into a store
and bought a boiled egg

1158
01:38:28,529 --> 01:38:31,498
She told me to eat
but I told her to eat

1159
01:38:32,466 --> 01:38:34,832
"You eat"
"No, you eat"

1160
01:38:34,902 --> 01:38:36,893
"You eat"
"No, you eat"

1161
01:38:37,438 --> 01:38:40,737
Then I hit it and

1162
01:38:41,942 --> 01:38:44,638
it was smashed

1163
01:38:45,846 --> 01:38:48,610
Then she beat me and said,

1164
01:38:49,149 --> 01:38:54,553
Why didn't you eat the damn egg?

1165
01:38:56,056 --> 01:38:59,025
We cried holding each other

1166
01:39:02,529 --> 01:39:05,862
I wanted to do
so many things for her

1167
01:39:07,368 --> 01:39:09,336
but she died of lung cancer

1168
01:39:11,138 --> 01:39:12,867
Poor girl

1169
01:39:14,041 --> 01:39:16,305
She was fucking pretty

1170
01:39:29,790 --> 01:39:32,258
He's a real detective now

1171
01:39:34,495 --> 01:39:38,226
When did his sister die?

1172
01:39:38,565 --> 01:39:41,762
He's an only child.
He has no sisters

1173
01:39:41,835 --> 01:39:43,427
What?

1174
01:40:06,695 --> 01:40:10,461
Act normal Understand?
Don't play any tricks

1175
01:40:15,136 --> 01:40:17,400
- Hello?
- This is the video shop

1176
01:40:17,506 --> 01:40:19,269
Return Girls' Dorm

1177
01:40:19,441 --> 01:40:22,376
- This isn't the first time!
- I'm not returning it!

1178
01:40:22,544 --> 01:40:25,206
Girls' Dorm? You scumbag!

1179
01:40:25,313 --> 01:40:27,975
- Don't hang up before I say so
- I see

1180
01:40:30,285 --> 01:40:32,446
- Got any news?
- Not yet

1181
01:40:33,221 --> 01:40:35,189
Go take a nap

1182
01:40:35,323 --> 01:40:37,951
- I'm not sure I can sleep
- Go take a sauna

1183
01:40:38,026 --> 01:40:39,926
I'll just have some coffee

1184
01:40:51,573 --> 01:40:53,837
- Where are you?
- Soochang!

1185
01:40:53,909 --> 01:40:56,503
Jaebong wants to see us.
Be there by 10

1186
01:40:57,512 --> 01:40:59,503
Ok

1187
01:41:02,651 --> 01:41:04,243
Where's there?

1188
01:42:11,353 --> 01:42:13,082
Take the other table!

1189
01:42:31,072 --> 01:42:32,835
Chil-sun, is that him?

1190
01:42:44,352 --> 01:42:46,047
Chil-sun!

1191
01:42:48,490 --> 01:42:50,287
Chil-sun?

1192
01:42:50,558 --> 01:42:53,493
What's he doing?

1193
01:43:42,110 --> 01:43:43,941
Get him!

1194
01:43:44,079 --> 01:43:45,740
Don't talk

1195
01:43:45,980 --> 01:43:48,414
Go get him!

1196
01:43:48,483 --> 01:43:50,417
Please, don't talk

1197
01:43:50,885 --> 01:43:52,819
Hurry and go

1198
01:43:52,954 --> 01:43:55,115
Ok, Ok

1199
01:43:55,490 --> 01:43:58,254
Please don't talk

1200
01:43:58,359 --> 01:44:00,190
You'll kill yourself. Damn it

1201
01:44:17,512 --> 01:44:20,242
Tell this asshole to go

1202
01:44:20,882 --> 01:44:23,077
Go, I'll take care of him

1203
01:44:23,451 --> 01:44:25,009
Go!

1204
01:46:22,403 --> 01:46:25,668
Come on! You fucking losers!

1205
01:46:31,279 --> 01:46:33,247
Put that down! Motherfucker!

1206
01:46:34,315 --> 01:46:36,215
Shoot!

1207
01:46:36,517 --> 01:46:38,917
Pull it!

1208
01:46:39,187 --> 01:46:40,779
Can't you shoot?

1209
01:46:40,889 --> 01:46:42,652
Should I pull it for you?

1210
01:46:43,191 --> 01:46:46,888
Use of Force Rule, you must tell
them to give up at least 3 times

1211
01:46:47,195 --> 01:46:48,662
Put it down

1212
01:46:50,298 --> 01:46:53,358
Don't put it down.
Now two more to go

1213
01:46:53,902 --> 01:46:56,097
- Put it down!
- No, Jay-soo!

1214
01:46:56,337 --> 01:46:58,328
Hold it just a little big longer

1215
01:46:58,439 --> 01:46:59,929
Put it down you motherfucker!

1216
01:47:00,008 --> 01:47:01,737
Put the gun down!

1217
01:47:05,480 --> 01:47:07,846
Jay-soo, you fucking bastard!

1218
01:47:17,825 --> 01:47:20,225
Fucking cowards

1219
01:48:32,567 --> 01:48:34,262
Chil-sun!

1220
01:48:47,382 --> 01:48:49,043
Did you get him?

1221
01:49:12,607 --> 01:49:14,131
Got him?

1222
01:49:43,504 --> 01:49:47,167
What was with you that night?

1223
01:49:47,241 --> 01:49:49,641
You were unlike yourself

1224
01:49:49,811 --> 01:49:51,972
Are you still wearing a cast?

1225
01:49:52,313 --> 01:49:54,213
Yeah, I'm not like I used to be

1226
01:49:54,315 --> 01:49:56,044
How were you before?

1227
01:49:56,150 --> 01:49:59,984
You don't know the real me

1228
01:50:00,054 --> 01:50:02,818
I caught two on my way to work
and three on my way back

1229
01:50:02,957 --> 01:50:05,187
Biannual!

1230
01:50:12,767 --> 01:50:14,735
Stitches, my stitches

1231
01:50:14,902 --> 01:50:16,597
Are you ok?

1232
01:50:17,038 --> 01:50:18,733
I'm ok

1233
01:50:20,975 --> 01:50:25,241
When you truly love someone,
a million roses will bloom

1234
01:50:25,480 --> 01:50:29,576
Roses of love
Without hatred, just love freely

1235
01:50:29,784 --> 01:50:32,252
How's it going with Nana?

1236
01:50:32,353 --> 01:50:34,947
I haven't seen her for 2 weeks

1237
01:50:35,022 --> 01:50:38,685
When I'm free, she's busy
When she's free, I'm busy

1238
01:50:39,794 --> 01:50:43,855
You can't even be biannual when you
don't even meet on a holiday like today

1239
01:50:51,873 --> 01:50:53,465
That asshole!

1240
01:50:54,175 --> 01:50:55,699
What is it?

1241
01:51:00,748 --> 01:51:02,409
Oh, shit!

1242
01:51:41,355 --> 01:51:43,721
Damn it!

1243
01:51:46,861 --> 01:51:49,352
They are always faster than us

1244
01:51:49,664 --> 01:51:52,599
We are always chasing them

1245
01:51:53,100 --> 01:51:57,002
Luckily there's a huge army
in North Korea

1246
01:51:57,071 --> 01:51:59,437
and the rest of the country is
surrounded by the sea

1247
01:51:59,907 --> 01:52:01,807
There's nowhere to hide
