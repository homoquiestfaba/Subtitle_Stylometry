00:02:03,264 --> 00:02:04,768
God damn it, Zog.

3
00:02:05,149 --> 00:02:07,164
Sorry, Sorry about that dude.

4
00:02:07,682 --> 00:02:09,482
Sorry.
- Jesus.

5
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,200
Damn day.

6
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:16,976
Dude, can I take that bone back?

7
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:19,851
<i>Life...</i>

8
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:22,160
What is it all mean?

9
00:02:22,472 --> 00:02:25,018
<i>What is our purpose?
Why are we here?</i>

10
00:02:25,636 --> 00:02:29,456
<i>We're born, breathe, we die.</i>

11
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:32,839
<i>And then, we're forgotten,</i>

12
00:02:33,513 --> 00:02:37,413
<i>only for another generation to
repeat the same seemingly irrelevant cycle.</i>

13
00:02:38,031 --> 00:02:39,731
<i>All just seem so pointless.</i>

14
00:02:39,928 --> 00:02:43,981
<i>And all along the way we mire ourselves
in the burdens and stresses of everyday modern life.</i>

15
00:02:44,299 --> 00:02:45,972
<i>The more complicated we make our existence,</i>

16
00:02:46,006 --> 00:02:49,179
<i>the more we destruct our conscious minds
from our inevitable mortality.</i>

17
00:02:50,404 --> 00:02:53,190
<i>Oh, how it all makes me yearn
for the innocence of my childhood.</i>

18
00:02:54,005 --> 00:02:55,405
<i>Those were the days.</i>

19
00:02:55,947 --> 00:02:57,777
<i>I look back now nostalgicly at that time,</i>

20
00:02:57,877 --> 00:03:00,592
<i>before adult responsibilities kicked in.</i>

21
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,374
<i>Oh, the frivolity of youth.</i>

22
00:03:04,027 --> 00:03:06,152
<i>What am I talking about,
I was miserable most of my childhood</i>

23
00:03:06,252 --> 00:03:08,752
<i>thanks to my
asshole older brother, Thudnik.</i>

24
00:03:09,242 --> 00:03:11,742
<i>Luckily, our father was
a fair and just mediator.</i>

25
00:03:11,815 --> 00:03:14,950
Dad, Thudnik hit me in the head with a rock again.

26
00:03:16,182 --> 00:03:17,444
What have you done?

27
00:03:17,912 --> 00:03:20,479
Sorry dad, it was an accident.

28
00:03:20,881 --> 00:03:24,481
Not you. You.

29
00:03:26,396 --> 00:03:29,093
How many times have I told you
to stop whining?

30
00:03:29,557 --> 00:03:32,210
<i>Allright, well, maybe he wasn't so fair
and just when it came to me..</i>

31
00:03:32,775 --> 00:03:36,359
<i>But he was the head of our tribe and
he knew how to keep his people safe from the Binadraks,</i>

32
00:03:36,502 --> 00:03:38,022
<i>the tribe on the other side of the mountain.</i>

33
00:03:39,001 --> 00:03:40,949
<i>Also he's a natural born charismatic leader,</i>

34
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,107
<i>he did have a certain "je ne sais qoi"
when it came to the ladies.</i>

35
00:03:44,132 --> 00:03:44,932
Hi.

36
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:49,841
<i>Of course, he set a questionable example</i>

37
00:03:50,233 --> 00:03:53,643
<i>as he was flagrantly clubbing other women
right under the nose of my mother.</i>

38
00:03:58,811 --> 00:04:00,011
Mom.

39
00:04:00,474 --> 00:04:04,174
Doesn't that bother you dad's was dragging
other women into the cage.

40
00:04:04,895 --> 00:04:07,375
Questions,
everything is a question.

41
00:04:08,468 --> 00:04:10,629
What bothers me is I've got a noodge for a son.

42
00:04:11,517 --> 00:04:15,029
<i>Why did I even try?
Mom love being first lady so much that</i>

43
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:18,712
<i>as long as she had a nice fur to wear
she was capable of looking pass to anything.</i>

44
00:04:19,067 --> 00:04:21,159
Why can't you be more like
your older brother?

45
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,640
Come on.

46
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:24,525
He is a natural born leader,

47
00:04:24,865 --> 00:04:27,944
and pretty soon he's
gonna be clubbing all the girls.

48
00:04:28,102 --> 00:04:30,124
This gonna be...
If you gonna get tougher

49
00:04:30,159 --> 00:04:33,800
Because this gonna be "bupkus"  for you.
Nothing.

50
00:04:35,957 --> 00:04:40,000
Girls, they...
They like of manly man.

51
00:04:40,035 --> 00:04:42,411
That's what they like.

52
00:04:44,812 --> 00:04:46,612
<i>I didn't wanna club all the girls.</i>

53
00:04:46,893 --> 00:04:48,693
<i>I didn't wanna club any of them.</i>

54
00:04:49,604 --> 00:04:51,404
<i>There was only one girl for me.</i>

55
00:04:51,881 --> 00:04:54,960
<i>Her name was Fardart.
She was the love of my life.</i>

56
00:04:55,377 --> 00:04:57,677
<i>As far as she knew we were
just best friends but,</i>

57
00:04:57,805 --> 00:04:59,641
<i>I dreamt some day we be more.</i>

58
00:04:59,681 --> 00:05:01,581
I'm in love with your brother, Thudnik.

59
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:06,825
Thudnik?
But he is an idiot.

60
00:05:07,269 --> 00:05:10,069
No, he's not.
He'll be head of the tribe one day.

61
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:12,727
He is a natural born leader
and he's so cute.

62
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:15,409
He is a minkukel.

63
00:05:16,254 --> 00:05:20,444
You're smart, unique, reflective person.

64
00:05:21,448 --> 00:05:23,348
You deserve someone better.

65
00:05:24,081 --> 00:05:27,979
Someone like...
- Like who, Ishbo?

66
00:05:30,765 --> 00:05:35,130
Like...
- Fardart! Time to pick lice off your brother.

67
00:05:35,165 --> 00:05:37,186
Coming mom.

68
00:05:38,709 --> 00:05:41,109
Can you talk to him?
See if he likes me.

69
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:43,001
Don't let him know I've asked you, though.

70
00:05:44,796 --> 00:05:46,005
Allright.

71
00:05:46,226 --> 00:05:48,026
You're the best, Ishbo.

72
00:05:52,046 --> 00:05:53,846
I'm such a wuss.

73
00:05:54,055 --> 00:05:55,855
<i>That was then and this is now.</i>

74
00:05:56,001 --> 00:05:59,260
<i>Good news is, I think the other members
of my tribe are finally starting to appreciate</i>

75
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,965
<i>my insatiable quest for the
unlocking of lifes grand mistery.</i>

76
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:05,610
<i>Or not.</i>

77
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:08,320
<i>In either event, I'm not giving up.
Life's a puzzle.</i>

78
00:06:08,388 --> 00:06:10,863
<i>And all the pieces are scattered around for everyone to see.</i>

79
00:06:11,003 --> 00:06:12,733
I just need to put it all together.

80
00:06:12,768 --> 00:06:15,868
<i>The ony trouble is, how the hell am I
supposed to figure out the meaning of life,</i>

81
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:18,040
<i>when I'm surrounded by freakin' Neanderthals?</i>

82
00:08:11,571 --> 00:08:15,822
<i>No matter what obstacles the Gods through our way,
the tribe was always pretty much the same.</i>

83
00:08:16,147 --> 00:08:17,543
<i>As was our daily existence.</i>

84
00:08:18,073 --> 00:08:22,837
<i>The three S's always apply: Shelter,
Sustenance and Survival.</i>

85
00:08:23,578 --> 00:08:27,411
<i>Breakfast usually consisted of some sort of
ham steak from a recent boar kill.</i>

86
00:08:27,769 --> 00:08:31,469
<i>But since the hunting have been season scares,
it was berries and leaves again.</i>

87
00:08:40,315 --> 00:08:43,715
<i>Some tribes just spice up their
leaves with cinch bugs or sand flees.</i>

88
00:08:43,973 --> 00:08:46,973
<i>But those exoskeletons wrecked havoc
on lower intestines.</i>

89
00:08:48,704 --> 00:08:51,402
<i>For the most part, daily life
on the plains was pretty routine.</i>

90
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,852
<i>The tribe, as a hole, managed to delecate
balance between survival and recreation.</i>

91
00:08:57,235 --> 00:08:59,837
<i>Zig and Zog had no problems
with the recreation part.</i>

92
00:09:01,686 --> 00:09:03,686
<i>They had discovered a weed
that when smoked,</i>

93
00:09:03,934 --> 00:09:05,963
<i>open their minds to
new levels of observation.</i>

94
00:09:06,905 --> 00:09:08,671
Do you wanna a see water buffalo fly, man?

95
00:09:09,418 --> 00:09:12,342
No, thanks, I'm cool.
- Allright.

96
00:09:19,906 --> 00:09:25,307
Yo, Zig, check it out,
a flying water buffalo,

97
00:09:27,256 --> 00:09:29,089
is like a rain buffalo.

98
00:09:29,634 --> 00:09:34,170
Listen, water is just rain
falling from the sky, right?

99
00:09:35,099 --> 00:09:39,323
So if a water buffalo is in the sky,

100
00:09:41,103 --> 00:09:46,686
it's a flying rain buffalo and then
you got, you got buffalo rain, man.

101
00:09:47,697 --> 00:09:49,500
Some crazy shit right there, man.

102
00:09:53,873 --> 00:09:59,099
Interesting, yeah, I never
would've thought of that.

103
00:10:00,064 --> 00:10:03,312
<i>The eldest member of our tribe
was known simply as "Old Fool".</i>

104
00:10:04,595 --> 00:10:08,997
<i>He was so old in fact that he actually had been around
since before the great wars with the Binadraks's started,</i>

105
00:10:09,205 --> 00:10:10,746
<i>and remember the day before fire.</i>

106
00:10:11,604 --> 00:10:13,404
<i>He was almost 30.</i>

107
00:10:14,242 --> 00:10:17,572
<i>Everyone else in the tribe thought
he was just crazy old man but I knew differently.</i>

108
00:10:17,873 --> 00:10:20,353
<i>He was actually wisest sage in the land.</i>

109
00:10:21,763 --> 00:10:24,642
Old Fool, would you mind
covering yourself please, for one?

110
00:10:24,837 --> 00:10:27,012
Your nudity is distracting me
from your wise thoughts.

111
00:10:27,385 --> 00:10:31,893
No, I refuse to wear these newfangled things.
What do you call them, clothes?

112
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:35,055
You smart ass kids and your technology,

113
00:10:35,294 --> 00:10:38,589
you're moving so Goddamn fast
I can't keep up.

114
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:43,165
Gods, meant for us to have furs, we'd have furs.

115
00:10:43,481 --> 00:10:46,670
I disagree. I think the Gods
provided us with the raw materials,

116
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:51,000
and the ability to think. It's our responsibility
to make the most of what we have our disposal.

117
00:10:51,053 --> 00:10:52,453
Don't you think?

118
00:10:53,193 --> 00:10:55,920
What kind of panty ass fagget talk is that?

119
00:10:57,135 --> 00:11:00,555
Listen, because I've been around
longer than anyone.

120
00:11:00,972 --> 00:11:03,635
You have questions and see can't through.

121
00:11:04,035 --> 00:11:07,215
Educate me Old Fool, you're the only one
in the tribe that has the knowledge I crave.

122
00:11:07,723 --> 00:11:12,650
All the riddles of our existence
can be deciphered with this.

123
00:11:17,667 --> 00:11:19,167
What is it?

124
00:11:21,231 --> 00:11:22,681
Turd.

125
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:24,180
My turd.

126
00:11:28,223 --> 00:11:30,292
It's a big turd.

127
00:11:32,103 --> 00:11:33,803
Great biggy.

128
00:11:38,895 --> 00:11:42,850
<i>My biggest disappointment was coming to the conclusion
that Old Fool wasn't actually wise at all.</i>

129
00:11:43,301 --> 00:11:46,535
<i>Complete imbecile.
For once, the others were right.</i>

130
00:11:51,503 --> 00:11:55,124
<i>My brother Thudnik, true to form,
grow up to be the perfect specimen of masculinity.</i>

131
00:11:56,421 --> 00:11:59,857
<i>His strength, agility, athleticism
and natural leadership skills,</i>

132
00:11:59,957 --> 00:12:03,648
<i>garanteed him the role of tribe leader
once my father crossed over into the afterlife.</i>

133
00:12:04,174 --> 00:12:06,727
<i>And like my father,
he was loved by the ladies.</i>

134
00:12:09,081 --> 00:12:13,975
<i>As much as I hated to admit it, I guess I was crippled
with jealousy over how effortless it all came to him.</i>

135
00:12:14,644 --> 00:12:16,361
<i>But I was gonna use that envy as fuel</i>

136
00:12:16,461 --> 00:12:18,631
<i>and evolve our species
beyond sticks and stones.</i>

137
00:12:19,615 --> 00:12:22,919
<i>How I's gonno do it, you may ask.
I'd become an inventor.</i>

138
00:12:23,315 --> 00:12:26,015
Hey, look everybody,
I just invented pants.

139
00:12:34,413 --> 00:12:36,571
Ishbo, are you OK?

140
00:12:36,999 --> 00:12:40,212
<i>One thing that definitely hadn't change
was the way I felt about Fardart.</i>

141
00:12:40,247 --> 00:12:41,312
Ishbo!

142
00:12:42,336 --> 00:12:44,702
I've died and gone to heaven.

143
00:12:46,759 --> 00:12:48,054
Come on, Thudnik.

144
00:12:48,055 --> 00:12:50,654
<i>Unfortunately, neither had her feelings for my brother.</i>

145
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,387
I mean he's clubbed every girl
on the tribe, but me.

146
00:12:55,038 --> 00:12:58,155
I'm not ugly.
Am I undesirable?

147
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:03,211
Smoke signals again.
Those Binadraks are up to something.

148
00:13:03,939 --> 00:13:05,612
Ishbo, you've been listening to me?

149
00:13:07,701 --> 00:13:09,580
I'm talking about something very important.

150
00:13:09,615 --> 00:13:12,399
Of course, my brother is a profound idiot.

151
00:13:12,449 --> 00:13:15,149
You're the hottest girl on the tribe.
I've told you million times.

152
00:13:15,471 --> 00:13:17,816
Really?
- Really.

153
00:13:19,163 --> 00:13:21,046
Okey, I guess it's not about me.

154
00:13:21,829 --> 00:13:25,198
What's happening with you, Ish?
What is happening in your love life?

155
00:13:26,185 --> 00:13:29,587
- Who do you have your eye on?
- Nobody.

156
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:34,666
Come on, you can tell your best friend.
- No, seriously, there is nobody.

157
00:13:34,766 --> 00:13:38,626
I have no time for such folderol, OK?
I'm too busy inventing things.

158
00:13:45,812 --> 00:13:47,612
Really Ishbo, that's absurd.

159
00:13:47,848 --> 00:13:51,456
Back to more important matters,
I have a secret.

160
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:54,299
Somebody likes you.

161
00:13:55,555 --> 00:13:58,882
- Really? Who?
- Somebody very close to you, right now.

162
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:03,609
But, if I tell you you can't say anything.
Your cousin, Urka.

163
00:14:06,717 --> 00:14:08,988
See the way that she looks
to you during campfire stories?

164
00:14:09,963 --> 00:14:12,628
What do you think?
- Not my type.

165
00:14:13,029 --> 00:14:14,529
Really?
- Yeah.

166
00:14:15,606 --> 00:14:18,306
God, I tell you guys would've made a really cute couple.
- I don't think so.

167
00:14:20,955 --> 00:14:23,150
I don't know, Ish.
There's gotta be somebody.

168
00:14:23,185 --> 00:14:26,718
No, don't bother. Just forget about it.
I can't get girls, it's worthless, OK?

169
00:14:26,867 --> 00:14:28,867
Listen, I don't even know how to club.

170
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:33,260
What?
You've never clubbed a girl?

171
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:36,575
No, I haven't. Is that so crazy?

172
00:14:41,515 --> 00:14:43,615
Now, you can do it.

173
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:46,670
you take her by the hair,
you drag her into the cave.

174
00:14:53,555 --> 00:14:55,155
Very romantic.

175
00:14:55,569 --> 00:14:58,367
OK, you try.
- I don't know.

176
00:15:06,275 --> 00:15:08,475
I wanna make this one a little prettier for you.

177
00:15:29,335 --> 00:15:31,835
You should be gotta wait for me
get out of the way that pumpkin.

178
00:15:36,507 --> 00:15:38,507
Did you just trying to club me?

179
00:15:40,087 --> 00:15:42,062
No, don't be ridiculous.

180
00:15:42,097 --> 00:15:43,573
No.

181
00:15:44,376 --> 00:15:45,376
Yes.

182
00:15:47,505 --> 00:15:51,151
Ishbo, what are you trying to say?

183
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:55,828
Fardart, I love you.

184
00:15:56,704 --> 00:15:59,704
I've been in love with you ever since we're children.
I've just been to afraid to do anything about it.

185
00:15:59,778 --> 00:16:02,934
Out of fear of rejection,
fear of messing of our friendship.

186
00:16:03,348 --> 00:16:05,448
And I know I'm not the biggest,
strongest member of the tribe,

187
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,281
but I know I can love you with
the power of the ten mastodonts.

188
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:12,319
You just give me chance, I know I can
make you the happiest girl on all of Pangea.

189
00:16:14,701 --> 00:16:15,705
Oh, Ishbo.

190
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:21,500
You saved the best for last, ha?

191
00:16:25,132 --> 00:16:27,082
I love you inspectin things.

192
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:29,904
See you comin'.

193
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:32,590
You're heavy.

194
00:16:35,832 --> 00:16:42,105
There I was, surrounded by
hungry, wooly mammoths.

195
00:16:44,663 --> 00:16:47,241
<i>Everynight after dinner, the tribe
would gather around the campfire,</i>

196
00:16:47,341 --> 00:16:49,356
<i>and listen to my uncle Unkie tell stories.</i>

197
00:16:49,602 --> 00:16:52,185
Giant dusks, bigger than my body.

198
00:16:52,943 --> 00:16:55,721
Sharp as thorns.

199
00:16:57,901 --> 00:17:01,467
<i>Uncle Unkie was my fathers twin brother
and the tribes designated stroy teller.</i>

200
00:17:01,624 --> 00:17:06,124
These enormous beasts
and only one thought on their mind.

201
00:17:06,478 --> 00:17:07,878
They kill me.

202
00:17:09,584 --> 00:17:13,540
<i>Night after night, he would regale
harrowing tales of his travels to forbidden places.</i>

203
00:17:14,551 --> 00:17:17,350
His words were a complex tapestry of twists and turns.

204
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:20,194
Holding the entire tribe captive
from the beginning to...

205
00:17:20,294 --> 00:17:21,794
THE END.

206
00:17:24,193 --> 00:17:25,693
Bravo uncle Unkie.

207
00:17:36,119 --> 00:17:38,619
Bork, why the hell you're clapping so loud?

208
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:42,291
Are you kidding? I mean,
that story kicked ass, man.

209
00:17:43,035 --> 00:17:45,054
He tells the same story every night.

210
00:17:45,357 --> 00:17:48,103
So?
- So, he tells the exact same story every night.

211
00:17:48,203 --> 00:17:51,343
He holds his goddamn hand out and
releases that mouse at the same time.

212
00:17:51,732 --> 00:17:53,614
Everybody screams like
they don't know what's coming next.

213
00:17:53,649 --> 00:17:55,173
Is it me? Am I crazy?

214
00:17:55,424 --> 00:17:57,677
Wouldn't it be nice once to hear a new story?

215
00:18:12,243 --> 00:18:14,043
This is very awkward.

216
00:18:19,332 --> 00:18:21,232
Now look what've done.

217
00:18:24,989 --> 00:18:29,165
Well, Mr. Bigshot inventor.

218
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,442
If you think you're
so much smarter than everybody else,

219
00:18:33,017 --> 00:18:35,933
and why don't you just
invent a new story?

220
00:18:41,178 --> 00:18:42,678
Allright.

221
00:18:47,797 --> 00:18:49,797
Good evening throwbacks and gentleman.

222
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:52,495
It's great to be back at the cave.

223
00:18:53,085 --> 00:18:59,062
I'm reminded tonight of why it is
that the ladies like caveman so much.

224
00:19:00,244 --> 00:19:02,144
They know all the best clubs.

225
00:19:05,365 --> 00:19:09,312
Is this thing on?
Hello? Hello?

226
00:19:11,539 --> 00:19:14,786
Allright, what do you call two lesbian cavewoman?

227
00:19:16,637 --> 00:19:19,611
Troglodykes.
Troglodykes!

228
00:19:23,346 --> 00:19:26,455
Now, onto the tribal updates.

229
00:19:27,091 --> 00:19:32,628
There's been some grumblings lately,
about the Binadraks unusual activity.

230
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:36,410
We've all seen the smoke
and we've heard the drums.

231
00:19:36,934 --> 00:19:44,517
But, as our chief and tribal leader,
I can assure you there's nothing to be fraid of.

232
00:19:45,724 --> 00:19:47,653
So, don't anybody panic.

233
00:19:48,374 --> 00:19:53,163
They wouldn't dare try any shenanigans
after the ass-whoopin' we gave them last spring.

234
00:19:53,277 --> 00:19:54,877
Right?
- You're right.

235
00:19:56,545 --> 00:19:59,018
OK, that's it.

236
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:02,281
Not quite, dad.
I have announcement to make.

237
00:20:04,268 --> 00:20:08,190
Everybody, Fardart and me
are getting married.

238
00:20:09,107 --> 00:20:11,278
Mazal Tov!

239
00:20:11,884 --> 00:20:13,884
<i>My worst nightmare come true.</i>

240
00:20:14,473 --> 00:20:16,527
<i>If only I had told her how I felt sooner,</i>

241
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:18,930
<i>maybe things would've been different.</i>

242
00:20:19,019 --> 00:20:20,171
<i>But it's too late now.</i>

243
00:20:20,827 --> 00:20:24,344
<i>The love of my life was marrying my taller,
stronger, better looking brother.</i>

244
00:20:24,652 --> 00:20:26,552
<i>There was nothing I could do about it.</i>

245
00:20:27,831 --> 00:20:29,931
<i>There would never be another woman for me.</i>

246
00:20:47,912 --> 00:20:49,714
<i>That night I had a dream.</i>

247
00:21:07,552 --> 00:21:10,034
Ishbo, I don't wanna be with Thudnik.

248
00:21:10,786 --> 00:21:13,322
I wanna be with you.

249
00:21:18,778 --> 00:21:21,649
Over here! Over here'
He is over here!

250
00:21:22,184 --> 00:21:27,250
- Fardart, what're you doing?
- He's gotta get away! Hurry!

251
00:21:30,051 --> 00:21:31,651
There he is!

252
00:21:39,672 --> 00:21:42,632
Guys, I'm not a goddamn wolly mammoth.

253
00:21:58,242 --> 00:21:59,742
Missed me.

254
00:22:07,258 --> 00:22:09,344
<i>This Fardart thing
was consuming my every thought.</i>

255
00:22:10,556 --> 00:22:13,120
<i>I turn to my closest friends
for guidance and support but</i>

256
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,784
<i>Caveman are not known for their sensitivity.</i>

257
00:22:15,796 --> 00:22:20,541
Look, Ishbo, reality check:
Fardart is gone.

258
00:22:20,922 --> 00:22:22,926
You were never in her league anyway, man.

259
00:22:23,169 --> 00:22:27,110
Right, now you don't have to waste your time
with any flase hopes.

260
00:22:27,735 --> 00:22:34,800
Look, your stud brother is marryin'.
And he's gonna be clubbin' her all day and all night.

261
00:22:35,825 --> 00:22:38,730
So your mind will forget it.
- Yeah, get laid.

262
00:22:39,199 --> 00:22:40,999
Dude, listen.

263
00:22:41,312 --> 00:22:45,643
Fact that Fardart wants to
marry your idiot brother

264
00:22:45,678 --> 00:22:47,715
just cause he's gonna be the
head of the tribe someday,

265
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:51,766
that don't sum it up nothing well.
She's a shallow bitch.

266
00:22:52,527 --> 00:22:55,827
You just whack one over the head
and get it over with, man.

267
00:22:56,142 --> 00:23:00,307
I don't know. I just seems cold. Maybe if I was
just better looking than I could get girls.

268
00:23:13,548 --> 00:23:15,148
<i>Maybe they were right.</i>

269
00:23:15,218 --> 00:23:19,032
<i>Maybe I was using excuses to mask my
deep seeded insecurities about women.</i>

270
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:21,340
<i>I was in a major depression.</i>

271
00:23:21,495 --> 00:23:24,595
<i>This Fardart and Thudnik thing
had hit me in my deepest level.</i>

272
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:41,603
<i>Could it be that I never express my love for Fardart earlier
because I was afraid that she would accept it?</i>

273
00:23:42,638 --> 00:23:44,538
<i>What a pathetic thought.</i>

274
00:23:44,656 --> 00:23:47,981
<i>I was at my lowest point and
at a total lost is to what to do next.</i>

275
00:23:48,455 --> 00:23:50,355
<i>That's when I saw, her.</i>

276
00:23:55,312 --> 00:23:57,012
<i>Her name was Ugna.</i>

277
00:23:58,621 --> 00:24:00,801
<i>I'd watch a grow up a gangly little girl.</i>

278
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:05,075
<i>But as if overnight,
she'd matured into a beautiful woman.</i>

279
00:24:08,401 --> 00:24:11,251
<i>Suddenly, a surge of masculinity overtook me.</i>

280
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:15,860
<i>If Fardart was unavailable,
I couldn't just pine away hoping for some miracle.</i>

281
00:24:16,324 --> 00:24:18,824
<i>Screw her!
I had to move on.</i>

282
00:24:18,887 --> 00:24:22,637
<i>But the first time I felt a freedom
to express my manhood.</i>

283
00:24:22,819 --> 00:24:27,563
<i>For Ugna was a woman right for the picking.
And I was a man hornier than shit.</i>

284
00:24:48,289 --> 00:24:52,057
<i>After Ugna didn't appear at the storytelling,
a search party was sent to look for the next day.</i>

285
00:24:53,283 --> 00:24:57,571
<i>Even though I felt terrible about what had happened,
I didn't see how it benefit anyone to confess</i>

286
00:24:57,671 --> 00:24:59,621
<i>that I accidently knocked her off a cliff.</i>

287
00:24:59,741 --> 00:25:02,154
We found her.
Oh, my God, it's horrible.

288
00:25:02,397 --> 00:25:05,961
- What happened?
- She was picking flowers, there was a cliff.

289
00:25:06,342 --> 00:25:10,374
She must've slipped, it's like a hundred feet.
Oh man, she's dead.

290
00:25:18,112 --> 00:25:22,897
<i>Usually, the tribe would've held the ceremony or funeral
and crimated her in the traditional bonfire ritual to the Gods,</i>

291
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:26,364
<i>But because meat was so scares that season,
we ate her instead.</i>

292
00:25:40,323 --> 00:25:42,607
No, thanks. I'm a little nauseous right now.

293
00:25:45,493 --> 00:25:48,441
<i>As the season progressed
things were getting more dire.</i>

294
00:25:48,584 --> 00:25:53,437
<i>Food was in all time low. I suggested that we wanted to
another location might be more fruitful but,</i>

295
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:55,770
<i>we all know how much the others listen to me.</i>

296
00:26:00,952 --> 00:26:02,952
I wonder if this shit's edible.

297
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:09,569
I'm sorry, man.

298
00:26:10,433 --> 00:26:11,303
Nice.

299
00:26:12,394 --> 00:26:13,694
I got one!

300
00:26:24,243 --> 00:26:26,043
I'm so proud of you.

301
00:26:29,179 --> 00:26:31,379
Now we gotta watch this?
Now we gotta look at this?

302
00:26:34,555 --> 00:26:37,971
You know, this is ridiculous. If the only fish
in this stream are those little ones,

303
00:26:37,973 --> 00:26:39,720
I don't know why don't we us my invention?

304
00:26:39,972 --> 00:26:41,372
Shut up, Ishbo.

305
00:26:41,373 --> 00:26:44,673
No one's interested in that
hairbrain thing you call it nut.

306
00:26:45,512 --> 00:26:48,414
A net. Look, I'll show it to you.
You'll like this.

307
00:26:50,856 --> 00:26:52,807
You just hold it onto the water

308
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:56,930
and the current rushes right through
all the little holes.

309
00:26:56,937 --> 00:26:59,199
I'll be able to catch hundreds of them all in one time.

310
00:26:59,234 --> 00:27:00,734
Really?
- Yeah.

311
00:27:01,804 --> 00:27:05,304
Oh, yeah? That is great, look at this.
- You just cast it across.

312
00:27:07,189 --> 00:27:10,314
We fish, like we always fish.
With spear.

313
00:27:10,315 --> 00:27:14,455
Really Ishbo, we've always fish with spears.
Why try something new when the old way works?

314
00:27:14,667 --> 00:27:18,439
Because if we can think of a better way to fish,
maybe we catch more fish.

315
00:27:18,843 --> 00:27:21,751
Really, it's about time we start
thinking out of the box here, people.

316
00:27:21,776 --> 00:27:25,262
An another thing:
What the hell is a box?

317
00:27:26,064 --> 00:27:27,331
<i>Though we never hung out much together, </i>

318
00:27:27,366 --> 00:27:31,503
there was one other member of the tribe
who was relegated to out cast status besides me.

319
00:27:32,087 --> 00:27:35,455
You know, I guess you're one
that was always nice to me so,

320
00:27:35,845 --> 00:27:38,215
Anybody is gonna understand me,
it's gotta be you.

321
00:27:38,409 --> 00:27:39,809
Of course.

322
00:27:41,203 --> 00:27:46,921
I don't know if you noticed it but
I've never been with a woman.

323
00:27:49,433 --> 00:27:52,501
It's a sad coincidence, really.
Neither have I.

324
00:27:53,770 --> 00:27:55,924
So I'm not the only total loser of the tribe.

325
00:27:57,048 --> 00:27:58,091
That's good.

326
00:27:58,426 --> 00:28:00,817
Let's not get crazy here, Rog,
what's the real problem?

327
00:28:01,443 --> 00:28:07,327
The problem is, I don't feel in.
You know, I have no desire to club a woman.

328
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:11,626
No interest whatsoever.
- Another coincidence. Same with me.

329
00:28:11,826 --> 00:28:19,215
I find it needlessly violent and disrespectful.
- So you and me were the same?

330
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:23,607
Cut from the same bolt of hide.
- Ishbo, why didn't you tell me this before?

331
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,511
What the is the matter with you?

332
00:28:29,415 --> 00:28:33,665
Sorry, I'm sorry I misinterpreted what you said.
I'm so embarrassed.

333
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:36,820
Rog, when I said I hadn't been with a woman
it isn't because I don't want to be.

334
00:28:36,845 --> 00:28:39,710
Right, it's because you don't
find them attractive. I'm sorry.

335
00:28:39,745 --> 00:28:43,206
Right.
- OK, well, goodbye forever.

336
00:28:44,536 --> 00:28:47,360
Wait, wait. Not so fast.
- So you are gay?

337
00:28:50,538 --> 00:28:51,638
No!

338
00:28:53,278 --> 00:28:57,157
It's just because you are, doesn't mean you have to
leave the tribe forever. This tribe is your home.

339
00:28:57,751 --> 00:29:02,421
But I don't feel welcome here.
- Rog, this tribe is your family.

340
00:29:02,727 --> 00:29:05,791
The courage you exhibit by
openly admiting your preference,

341
00:29:06,097 --> 00:29:09,280
may inspire others will feel similarly
to speak up unafraid as well.

342
00:29:09,637 --> 00:29:12,386
You'll be a pioneer, Rog.
You'll be a hero.

343
00:29:13,987 --> 00:29:19,718
I've never thought about like that before.
You know, I do fell kind of liberated, you know.

344
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:23,070
Like a giant weight's been
taken off my shoulders.

345
00:29:24,406 --> 00:29:27,721
Ishbo, you've taught me
a very valuable lesson here today.

346
00:29:28,395 --> 00:29:31,753
You taught me not to be ashamed of who I am.

347
00:29:32,369 --> 00:29:36,065
You know what, this is my home.
So, I'm not going anywhere.

348
00:29:36,631 --> 00:29:43,093
In fact, I'm gonna march right over the tribe and yell:
Hey, I am a gay caveman!

349
00:29:43,232 --> 00:29:45,869
Listen, Ishbo is gay, he is the gay one.

350
00:29:46,031 --> 00:29:49,756
<i>Though the result of Rogs admission
didn't go exactly as here I had hoped.</i>

351
00:29:50,664 --> 00:29:54,244
<i>I'm sure Rog would've been equally proud to
know the sustenance that he provided to the tribe,</i>

352
00:29:54,279 --> 00:29:57,077
<i>was greatly needed at this critical time near famine.</i>

353
00:30:00,102 --> 00:30:04,005
No, thanks, I'm on a diet.
- What's a diet?

354
00:30:11,293 --> 00:30:13,500
Isn't that beautiful?

355
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:17,700
Yes, it is.

356
00:30:19,999 --> 00:30:23,169
Ishbo!
I thought that we were over this.

357
00:30:23,487 --> 00:30:26,598
We are best friends soon
to be in laws and that's it.

358
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,159
I can't help it, allright.
Just cause you're marrying my brother

359
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,792
doesn't mean I can shut a whole
lifetime of feelings off just like that.

360
00:30:32,827 --> 00:30:35,683
Well, you're gonna have to try.
Really try.

361
00:30:36,471 --> 00:30:38,371
You know what your problem is?
- What?

362
00:30:38,623 --> 00:30:42,595
You too in your head.
You always trying to figure out the meaning behind everything.

363
00:30:43,166 --> 00:30:46,916
Maybe you just need to turn off
your brain for once and be a little more animal.

364
00:30:48,098 --> 00:30:51,987
Isn't that what sets us apart from the animals are brains?
- Here you go again.

365
00:30:53,869 --> 00:30:57,700
Yeah, right, there I go again.
Because I, I can't help but believe

366
00:30:57,710 --> 00:31:02,539
that we as a species, have the ability to evolve
way beyond sticks and stones to who knows what heights.

367
00:31:03,085 --> 00:31:04,510
Allright, like, for example, OK?

368
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:09,312
What if it were possible one day
to contain light, allright?

369
00:31:09,313 --> 00:31:13,897
A lot of light in a very small space and
concentrate that light into a very thin beam.

370
00:31:14,115 --> 00:31:17,941
Allright? And what if we could use
that beam to burn off unwanted hair.

371
00:31:18,294 --> 00:31:19,994
I mean, it's possible.

372
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:24,908
You totally insane.
You do realize this.

373
00:31:28,753 --> 00:31:31,443
- Ish.
- Don't marry him, marry me.

374
00:31:31,444 --> 00:31:32,459
Ishbo!

375
00:31:32,725 --> 00:31:36,570
I'm telling you, you're making a huge mistake.
What does he have that I don't have?

376
00:31:39,475 --> 00:31:42,676
- You really want me to answer that?
- No, forget that question.

377
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:46,290
Bad quesiton, OK?
Forget about that but seriously.

378
00:31:47,314 --> 00:31:48,851
I really do think you're making a mistake.

379
00:31:48,951 --> 00:31:51,265
I mean, sure he's got a lot of cromagnetism now

380
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:54,830
but once the giddy dumb face wears off,
you guys gonna have nothing to talk about.

381
00:31:54,855 --> 00:31:56,351
Come on, marry me.

382
00:31:58,978 --> 00:32:03,364
Not gonna happen, right?

383
00:32:03,399 --> 00:32:07,286
We can blame a guy for tryin'.
- I suppose.

384
00:32:09,205 --> 00:32:11,305
Can't you just be happy for me?

385
00:32:29,797 --> 00:32:33,250
<i>In normal circumstances, your brothers
bachelor party sholud be a joyous occassion.</i>

386
00:32:34,039 --> 00:32:36,726
<i>But for me, it was the opposite.</i>

387
00:32:52,162 --> 00:32:54,062
Have a little drink bro.

388
00:32:55,976 --> 00:32:59,730
Ishbo, my little Ishbo.
We gotta hang out more often.

389
00:32:59,870 --> 00:33:04,170
You know, do more brotherly things
together like, club chicks, double team.

390
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:08,857
You know, things that brothers should do together.
- Thudnik, aren't you about to be married?

391
00:33:10,208 --> 00:33:11,308
Good one.

392
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:19,497
Look Ish, I know you always had
your little heart set on Fardart.

393
00:33:19,692 --> 00:33:23,086
And I know I stole her away from you,
even though you never had a shot anyway.

394
00:33:23,144 --> 00:33:25,648
But, I want you to know
I understand the situation here.

395
00:33:25,894 --> 00:33:29,864
I'm gonna tell you something that I think
it's gonna make everything a lot better.

396
00:33:34,777 --> 00:33:37,877
Thanks Thudnik,
I appreciate that, thank you.

397
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,220
She's a shitty lay.

398
00:33:44,961 --> 00:33:49,618
Girl's got no instincts for getting the groove on,
you know, she's a rhythm killer.

399
00:33:50,077 --> 00:33:54,009
Horrible flexibility, and
she gives a toothie bj.

400
00:33:55,769 --> 00:34:02,050
You know, that's what I'm trying to tell you
Ishy, is you're not missing out on shit.

401
00:34:03,254 --> 00:34:07,508
Maybe I'm not clubbing her hard enough
but I can barely even get a legs open, you know.

402
00:34:07,543 --> 00:34:10,749
I mean, granted, it's good when I get it in there,
but I gotta work for it.

403
00:34:10,784 --> 00:34:12,884
Who wants to do that?

404
00:34:14,649 --> 00:34:17,885
You know it. Well, you don't really know
what I'm talking about, do you?

405
00:34:21,135 --> 00:34:23,389
You're right Thudnik,
I feel a lot better now.

406
00:34:23,451 --> 00:34:25,551
Thank you, may I have sip of that please?

407
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,640
Knock yourself out.

408
00:34:28,392 --> 00:34:31,733
<i>To get drunk, the tribe drank a beverage
that consisted of stream water,</i>

409
00:34:31,863 --> 00:34:34,763
<i>fermented berries, mashed
grub worms, and urine.</i>

410
00:34:36,558 --> 00:34:38,858
I put some extra piss in there, for you.

411
00:36:04,365 --> 00:36:05,759
Kiss me, Ishbo.

412
00:36:51,691 --> 00:36:52,899
What am I done?

413
00:36:54,453 --> 00:36:57,451
<i>After a long morning of throwing up,
I gathered my spear.</i>

414
00:36:57,678 --> 00:37:00,814
<i>Seems Zig and Zog had discovered
some fresh wolly mammoth tracks,</i>

415
00:37:00,949 --> 00:37:03,613
<i>So for the first time in months,
we're on the hunt.</i>

416
00:37:03,812 --> 00:37:08,611
You know, I really should be back at the tribe.
I'm actually wolly mammoth phobic.

417
00:37:09,088 --> 00:37:15,666
Call me crazy, I don't know but it just seems like
giant fur covered pachyderms that eat people are terrifying.

418
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:19,693
On that note, I'm actually gonna head back,
if you don't mind. I'll see you guys later.

419
00:37:19,727 --> 00:37:23,293
You turn around and
I spear you in the back.

420
00:37:26,521 --> 00:37:30,856
My father, folks.
That's my dad.

421
00:37:33,645 --> 00:37:37,517
I can taste it already, man.
- Yeah, wooly burgers, dude.

422
00:37:38,185 --> 00:37:40,279
Dibs on the asshole.

423
00:37:45,032 --> 00:37:46,799
Hey, Borg, do you have more that water?

424
00:37:46,834 --> 00:37:48,538
Sorry, dad.
- What?

425
00:37:48,812 --> 00:37:51,554
What's the matter with you?
Watch this!

426
00:37:52,626 --> 00:37:53,515
Hold this.

427
00:37:56,405 --> 00:37:57,374
Here!

428
00:37:58,451 --> 00:38:02,204
Great. Now I'm completely defenceless out here.
I have to go back now.

429
00:38:02,503 --> 00:38:03,603
Good bye.

430
00:38:04,264 --> 00:38:06,173
Keep walkin'.

431
00:38:08,112 --> 00:38:11,445
What the hell is this supposed to be?
We're hunting wooly mammoth, not duck.

432
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:16,704
It's not duck camouflage, you idiot.

433
00:38:17,009 --> 00:38:19,536
It's called a visor.
Keeps the sun out of my face.

434
00:38:19,568 --> 00:38:21,911
You know how delicate my skin is?

435
00:38:22,074 --> 00:38:23,574
Are you retarded?

436
00:38:27,723 --> 00:38:28,551
Let's go.

437
00:38:29,783 --> 00:38:31,483
Hello melanoma.

438
00:38:35,901 --> 00:38:39,697
Wait, I got a rock in my shoe.
I got a rock in my shoe, hold up.

439
00:38:48,418 --> 00:38:49,618
Jesus.

440
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:53,845
- Prints look pretty fresh, dude.
- It's about to be close by.

441
00:38:54,095 --> 00:38:56,299
It was clear he's going that way.

442
00:38:57,001 --> 00:39:01,581
- It looks to this tracks...
- Wow, those are some really big feet.

443
00:39:01,616 --> 00:39:06,779
Well, you know what they say about big feet.
Big johnson, like me.

444
00:39:08,478 --> 00:39:10,413
Came from behind these hills.

445
00:39:11,107 --> 00:39:15,790
And looks to these tracks, he's alone.

446
00:39:27,548 --> 00:39:29,448
What the hell is this now?

447
00:39:35,534 --> 00:39:37,535
There's something wrong with that gentlman.

448
00:39:56,595 --> 00:39:58,595
That had to hold to my penis.

449
00:40:06,309 --> 00:40:08,461
Now, do you see why these
stupid things are bad idea?

450
00:40:08,673 --> 00:40:10,873
Humans were not meant to wear pants.

451
00:40:12,822 --> 00:40:13,764
My prototype!

452
00:40:16,796 --> 00:40:17,918
I think he went over.

453
00:40:19,113 --> 00:40:21,933
Goddamn, what the hell happened there?

454
00:40:32,198 --> 00:40:35,505
It's poo.
I fell in poo.

455
00:40:36,821 --> 00:40:41,185
You know boy? You are
dummer than dinosaur dumb.

456
00:40:42,961 --> 00:40:47,052
- Eww, it reeks, man.
- Yeah, try takin' a mud bath in it.

457
00:40:47,873 --> 00:40:49,373
What was it eating?

458
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:54,580
I don't think we wanna know
what was eating.

459
00:40:56,070 --> 00:40:57,074
Look...

460
00:40:58,179 --> 00:41:02,752
Why don't you reach back in there again
and see if you can find anything else.

461
00:41:02,931 --> 00:41:06,831
Something could help us with the hunt.
Let's see what we are up against.

462
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:11,852
- Why me?
- Because we're already covered with the stuff.

463
00:41:23,914 --> 00:41:26,568
That's a Binadraks nackles.
They all wear 'em.

464
00:41:26,651 --> 00:41:29,613
That thing ate a whole Binadraks.

465
00:41:30,441 --> 00:41:33,419
He's probably unarmed.
We're fine. We have spears.

466
00:41:37,693 --> 00:41:39,793
That a good sign.
Anything else?

467
00:41:43,254 --> 00:41:44,954
Couple of his friends.

468
00:41:47,726 --> 00:41:51,158
You know what?
That's it!

469
00:41:52,484 --> 00:41:57,710
Call me a chicken, spear me
in the back, I don't care.

470
00:41:57,845 --> 00:42:01,254
That thing ate three whole Binadraks,

471
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:05,715
and used its spear
as a toothpick, OK?

472
00:42:06,526 --> 00:42:08,406
I'm going back to the camp now, allright?

473
00:42:08,506 --> 00:42:12,329
If you need me, I'll be under
a nice damp rock, crying.

474
00:42:13,033 --> 00:42:14,533
Sayounara, suckers.

475
00:42:30,301 --> 00:42:33,877
<i>Holy Shit. Ishbo get out of his mouth!</i>

476
00:42:34,386 --> 00:42:38,508
<i>No, my brother got eaten by a wolly mammoth,
let's get over it, knock with the hunt.</i>

477
00:42:40,385 --> 00:42:42,965
<i>You got the arrow right in his ass, man.</i>

478
00:42:44,743 --> 00:42:47,021
<i>I'm the king of the world.</i>

479
00:42:47,708 --> 00:42:49,733
<i>Ishbo, God, you stink.</i>

480
00:42:49,939 --> 00:42:52,748
<i>Bravo, not bad guys!</i>

481
00:42:53,062 --> 00:42:55,903
<i>Let's congratulate these newly weds.</i>

482
00:42:56,193 --> 00:43:00,431
They will fill our tribe with
future hunters, warriors.

483
00:43:04,077 --> 00:43:07,546
<i>Now it was official.
Thudnik and Fardart were married.</i>

484
00:43:08,122 --> 00:43:10,690
<i>I spilled my heart to her
and it made no difference.</i>

485
00:43:11,097 --> 00:43:12,697
<i>She loved my brother.</i>

486
00:43:13,026 --> 00:43:16,829
<i>Why is it that love can be more painful
than being eaten by wolly mammoth.</i>

487
00:43:17,333 --> 00:43:22,301
<i>How can an abstract concept actually
fell more powerful than giant grinding bicuspids?</i>

488
00:43:23,196 --> 00:43:24,696
<i>Just didn't make sense.</i>

489
00:43:25,908 --> 00:43:28,874
<i>Maybe love was a cruel joke
being played on us by the Gods.</i>

490
00:43:29,311 --> 00:43:32,670
<i>Perhaps they laugh at our weakness
when it comes to this silly feeling.</i>

491
00:43:33,418 --> 00:43:37,709
<i>Hell, maybe there aren't even any
Gods after all. What do I know.</i>

492
00:43:43,494 --> 00:43:46,082
Help!
Everybody, come quick!

493
00:43:46,272 --> 00:43:48,317
Hurry up! Come quick!
Help!

494
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:50,049
What the hell is this now?

495
00:43:50,608 --> 00:43:55,094
Ishbo, is this, I don't wanna hear your stupid...
- No. A Binadraks spy.

496
00:43:55,284 --> 00:43:57,140
A Binadraks spy, look.

497
00:43:57,985 --> 00:43:59,467
A Binadraks spy.

498
00:43:59,677 --> 00:44:03,582
That's right, he came up behind me with a rock
and he was gonna bash my skull and...

499
00:44:03,718 --> 00:44:09,483
He was sneaking right up behind me.
And my keen sense of perception betrayed him.

500
00:44:09,650 --> 00:44:13,697
Because I sensed him there and so then I,
I grabbed him around the head and...

501
00:44:14,163 --> 00:44:17,169
flipped him over my back and
I got him a scissor-lock with my legs.

502
00:44:17,452 --> 00:44:20,430
And then when I felt that I had
weakened him slightly

503
00:44:20,487 --> 00:44:24,744
I used my wooly mamouth bone and I cracked him
over the skull and knocked him unconcious.

504
00:44:25,530 --> 00:44:27,030
It was nothing.

505
00:44:28,876 --> 00:44:30,438
We can torture him

506
00:44:31,978 --> 00:44:33,654
for their battle plans.

507
00:44:37,696 --> 00:44:43,897
This is just another Binadraks spy.
His name is Krots.

508
00:44:44,790 --> 00:44:48,391
And he is one of the Binadraks most ruthless assassins.

509
00:44:50,085 --> 00:44:51,685
Ruthless assassin?

510
00:44:51,794 --> 00:44:55,884
He's also reputed to have mystical powers.

511
00:44:55,919 --> 00:45:01,546
He bind the minds of animals
and make them do his evil bidding.

512
00:45:03,406 --> 00:45:06,951
He was probably sent here to kill me.

513
00:45:08,862 --> 00:45:10,431
Way to go, Ishbo.

514
00:45:12,615 --> 00:45:16,558
You saved my life.
Thank you my son.

515
00:45:16,995 --> 00:45:19,011
Way to go, Ishbo.

516
00:45:19,351 --> 00:45:23,029
Some kind of magnificent hero
or something, man.

517
00:45:23,064 --> 00:45:26,412
It was the best what he was did ever.
Where did you find the courage?

518
00:45:26,661 --> 00:45:32,986
Well, you know, courage isn't found Fardart,
You either born with it or you're not.

519
00:45:33,965 --> 00:45:35,615
I guess I was just born with it.

520
00:46:03,099 --> 00:46:06,008
Where am I?
- Shut up, Binadraks spy.

521
00:46:07,904 --> 00:46:09,666
What the hell with the Binadraks up to?

522
00:46:10,623 --> 00:46:14,966
Spill your guts scumbag or I'll rip them out your stomach
and hang you from a tree with them.

523
00:46:15,827 --> 00:46:17,262
Ooh, that sounds nasty.

524
00:46:17,362 --> 00:46:19,293
What sounds nasty is
when I bite your tongue off

525
00:46:19,328 --> 00:46:22,785
and spit it back in your mouth so
you can have some fun with yourself.

526
00:46:24,852 --> 00:46:28,192
I'm not telling you anything.
Not telling you nothing.

527
00:46:30,487 --> 00:46:32,677
If he changes his mind

528
00:46:33,473 --> 00:46:38,411
after we introduce him to Mr. Fire.

529
00:46:39,250 --> 00:46:45,492
You tell us, or I'm gonna slowly burn
your flesh while you begging for mercy.

530
00:46:51,131 --> 00:46:52,108
Shit...

531
00:46:55,647 --> 00:46:58,904
You want me to tell you warplan?
My war plan?

532
00:47:00,497 --> 00:47:04,422
You can infect me with all the bodily harm
you wish to infect me

533
00:47:04,833 --> 00:47:09,696
You can cut off my toes, you can cut of my fingers,
you can cut off my nose, you can cut off my penis,

534
00:47:09,796 --> 00:47:14,500
you can pour burning firing ashes into
my ass but you know what?

535
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:20,148
I will not tell you anything!
Nothing!

536
00:47:21,743 --> 00:47:26,481
Are we clear?
- Well, if it's torture you want,

537
00:47:28,044 --> 00:47:30,365
Ishbo, pull off his shoes.

538
00:47:33,953 --> 00:47:37,428
Maybe Zog should do it, because I'm actually
late for my high colonic right now.

539
00:47:41,091 --> 00:47:42,291
That was good.

540
00:47:52,629 --> 00:47:54,019
Smells good to me.

541
00:47:55,157 --> 00:47:59,000
Here Ishbo, brush off his feet.

542
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:02,700
so we can set him on fire.

543
00:48:41,501 --> 00:48:43,083
Ok, ok, I'll talk.

544
00:48:43,118 --> 00:48:46,861
I'll tell you my war plan.
I'll tell you my war plan just stop tickling me.

545
00:48:49,656 --> 00:48:53,700
<i>Krots sang like a canary. He revealed that
his plan was indeed to kill my father,</i>

546
00:48:53,786 --> 00:48:55,586
<i>to weaken our tribes leadership.</i>

547
00:48:55,970 --> 00:49:00,197
<i>Then, on the morning after the next full moon,
the Binadraks were planning their big attack.</i>

548
00:49:02,319 --> 00:49:05,412
<i>While everyone was in the cave
strategizing our retaliation war plan,</i>

549
00:49:05,687 --> 00:49:08,587
<i>I was giving the important task of
guarding the prisoner.</i>

550
00:49:09,225 --> 00:49:10,932
What are you looking at big nose?

551
00:49:14,551 --> 00:49:19,413
Nobody stinks up on old Ishbo the tickler
and gets away with it.

552
00:49:20,470 --> 00:49:25,643
You know, sometimes, I tickle people,
just for lookin' at me funny.

553
00:49:26,420 --> 00:49:30,436
You know, I'm mean.
I'm a mean mofu.

554
00:49:31,216 --> 00:49:36,514
You know, one time I tickle the guy so hard,
he exploded. You should have seen this.

555
00:49:37,244 --> 00:49:39,998
Messed me up inside,
filled me with hate.

556
00:49:40,632 --> 00:49:41,462
I hate you.

557
00:49:42,437 --> 00:49:48,382
That's why I wanna tickle you,

558
00:49:48,469 --> 00:49:51,869
You know what I'd like to do right now?
I'd like to tickle you head right off.

559
00:49:53,121 --> 00:49:55,021
Shame the others wanna keep you alive.

560
00:49:55,795 --> 00:49:57,695
Cause you know what I'd like to do to you?

561
00:49:59,613 --> 00:50:01,613
What would you like to do to me?

562
00:50:05,270 --> 00:50:08,435
I'd like to give you
your feather back, sir.

563
00:50:18,060 --> 00:50:22,428
What is it, where is he?
Hey, Ishbo, where is he?

564
00:50:24,356 --> 00:50:25,778
He's like gone.

565
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:31,595
- Ishbo, you had one job.
- He's a mystical assassin.

566
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:34,594
I don't know how to...
What am I...

567
00:50:36,577 --> 00:50:39,277
- Listen I...
- One job, moron.

568
00:50:43,261 --> 00:50:45,961
Our intelligance has been compermised.

569
00:50:46,395 --> 00:50:50,579
By tomorrow, that filthy spy will be at
Binadraks headquarters.

570
00:50:50,714 --> 00:50:54,514
reporting all our most sensitive
military secrets.

571
00:50:56,981 --> 00:50:59,374
What secrets?
- Shut up, Ishbo.

572
00:50:59,726 --> 00:51:03,445
You're disgrace to the tribe. You're lucky
we don't stone you to death for treason.

573
00:51:04,242 --> 00:51:07,108
- Well...
- Cause I would, oh, yeah.

574
00:51:08,491 --> 00:51:12,652
All able bodied men will report
for basic training at dawn.

575
00:51:12,819 --> 00:51:16,060
Gentleman, we are at war.

576
00:51:24,026 --> 00:51:25,284
Can I make a suggestion, please?

577
00:51:27,528 --> 00:51:31,028
I told you to shut  up!
- Dad?

578
00:51:34,349 --> 00:51:37,831
Make it quick.
- Allright, I know this may sound crazy.

579
00:51:38,314 --> 00:51:41,421
It's just so crazy it might work.
Let's flee.

580
00:51:42,173 --> 00:51:44,874
Come on, Ishbo...

581
00:51:44,909 --> 00:51:46,369
Bullshit.

582
00:51:47,334 --> 00:51:52,680
A Moonagongoons do not flee.
- Dad, can I bash his skull now?

583
00:51:52,715 --> 00:51:55,430
Just hear me out for a second, please.
Allright?

584
00:51:56,044 --> 00:52:00,902
What are we fighting for? OK, does anyone even
remember why we're at war with the Binadraks?

585
00:52:01,363 --> 00:52:02,727
Show off hands, please.

586
00:52:04,783 --> 00:52:06,767
Allright, now we're finally getting somewhere.

587
00:52:06,802 --> 00:52:11,218
If we can pinpoint the origins of this conflict
maybe we can reach some sort of peaceful resolution.

588
00:52:11,318 --> 00:52:13,214
Old Fool, you've been around
longer than anybody.

589
00:52:13,215 --> 00:52:16,100
What started this sensless wars
with the Binadraks in the first place?

590
00:52:16,899 --> 00:52:21,619
I put a baby wombat up my rectum
a couple hours ago.

591
00:52:22,311 --> 00:52:26,335
And from the feel of things it's still alive up there.

592
00:52:37,788 --> 00:52:41,712
Company, fall in!
Atten-hut!

593
00:52:43,103 --> 00:52:44,920
Allright ladies, let's looks like an army.

594
00:52:45,225 --> 00:52:47,718
Suck in those guts.
stick out those chest.

595
00:52:47,753 --> 00:52:49,271
Clinch those butt-tops.

596
00:52:49,935 --> 00:52:51,829
Are you a bunch of yellow belly sissy?

597
00:52:52,046 --> 00:52:53,946
Sir, no, sir.
Are you ready to kill?

598
00:53:07,128 --> 00:53:10,815
Sorry, I'm late Thudnik. I was just scrawling
my last will and testament on the cave wall.

599
00:53:11,383 --> 00:53:12,738
Just in case, you know.

600
00:53:12,945 --> 00:53:15,545
Is there any way to address the
commanding officer, maggot?

601
00:53:16,402 --> 00:53:21,293
Sir! When addressing a commanding officer, you always
show respect for his command by saying, sir!

602
00:53:24,542 --> 00:53:26,367
We have to be so dramatic?
I mean, this's just us.

603
00:53:26,467 --> 00:53:28,435
This army will not tolerated subordination.

604
00:53:28,818 --> 00:53:33,064
If you refuse to address your commanding officer as sir!
It will be taken as a hostile gesture,

605
00:53:33,164 --> 00:53:37,084
and you will be charged with treason
and executed. Do you understand?

606
00:53:42,923 --> 00:53:44,123
Yes, sir!

607
00:53:45,358 --> 00:53:46,558
Sir, yes, sir.

608
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:49,440
Yes, sir, sir.

609
00:53:50,146 --> 00:53:51,984
No, not "Yes, sir, sir".

610
00:53:52,287 --> 00:53:53,677
Sir, yes, sir.

611
00:53:53,732 --> 00:53:56,451
That's what I said:
"Sir, yes, sir", sir.

612
00:53:57,638 --> 00:53:59,193
High knees, high knees, high knees!

613
00:53:59,494 --> 00:54:01,412
Come on, Ishbo, go.
Get the lead out.

614
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:03,267
Come on, Ishbo, move

615
00:54:03,376 --> 00:54:06,812
move, move, move.
Ok, go.

616
00:54:09,063 --> 00:54:13,746
I want my logs back in line!
I want my logs back in line!

617
00:54:14,252 --> 00:54:17,144
What? Get back here.
Where you think you're going, Ishbo?

618
00:54:17,829 --> 00:54:19,329
Are you fucking retarded?

619
00:54:19,557 --> 00:54:22,914
Come on, Ishbo,
let's see your belly crawl.

620
00:54:22,961 --> 00:54:26,060
This is the easiest one.
You can not mess this up.

621
00:54:26,453 --> 00:54:30,029
Do it with the elbow. Do it with the el...
No, that is not belly.

622
00:54:30,250 --> 00:54:35,557
It's not belly crowl course!
Hey, Ishbo, that's army property!

623
00:54:35,692 --> 00:54:39,503
I'm getting very confused. Is it, allright, hold on.
Is it: "Yes, sir, sir"? Sir.

624
00:54:39,617 --> 00:54:42,713
Or is it:
"Yes, sir, yes ,sir?" Sir.

625
00:54:42,935 --> 00:54:47,011
Or is it:
Yes, sir. Sir, yes, sir, sir?

626
00:54:47,370 --> 00:54:50,483
That's good for footing. That's what I like.
That's climb and conquer.

627
00:54:50,518 --> 00:54:52,194
Now, that is climb and conquer.

628
00:54:52,408 --> 00:54:56,522
See how he's got his foot up there in the west side ledge?
That's you do it.

629
00:54:57,483 --> 00:54:58,668
Ishbo!

630
00:55:02,498 --> 00:55:06,432
This is the stupidist thing
I've ever seen in my life, Ishbo.

631
00:55:07,887 --> 00:55:11,633
Sir, yes, sir. Sir, yes, sir.

632
00:55:12,066 --> 00:55:17,820
Sir, yes, sir.
Sir, yes, sir. Sir, yes, sir.

633
00:55:22,270 --> 00:55:24,451
Is that so hard?
- No.

634
00:55:24,636 --> 00:55:25,601
Sir, no, sir.

635
00:55:26,230 --> 00:55:27,830
Sir, no, sir.

636
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:31,235
What the hell's matter with you?
- Here we go again.

637
00:55:34,116 --> 00:55:37,391
<i>Full moon came up fast.
Tomorrow morning was the big war.</i>

638
00:55:37,718 --> 00:55:41,974
<i>As any good leader would, dad gave his
traditional pep talk to the troops on the eve of battle.</i>

639
00:55:43,113 --> 00:55:48,187
Man, tomorrow we fight in the honor of our cave.

640
00:55:49,502 --> 00:55:52,694
Some of us may not make it out alive.

641
00:55:53,184 --> 00:55:57,689
But know this: It is a cause
worth dying for.

642
00:55:58,608 --> 00:56:00,308
Well, that's debatable.

643
00:56:02,908 --> 00:56:08,607
No dissension among ranks:
You are with us or you are against us.

644
00:56:09,751 --> 00:56:14,623
Which is it, Ishmo?
- Ishbo, dad. - Oh, whatever.

645
00:56:17,396 --> 00:56:19,327
Failure is not an option.

646
00:56:20,661 --> 00:56:23,001
Failure is not an option!

647
00:56:23,864 --> 00:56:33,176
Failure is not an option!
Failure is not an option.

648
00:57:11,194 --> 00:57:15,190
Hey Bork, who is that guy?
- I thought that it was with you.

649
00:57:15,548 --> 00:57:17,548
With me? Who do I know?

650
00:57:18,710 --> 00:57:21,573
You don't think he is a Binadraks spy to you?
- Ishbo, would you shut up?

651
00:57:21,891 --> 00:57:24,091
I'm trying to set myself up for battle.

652
00:57:31,104 --> 00:57:32,804
Excuse me, do I know you?

653
00:57:33,058 --> 00:57:35,178
Ishbo, benim.
- Who?

654
00:57:36,763 --> 00:57:38,757
Fardart, what are you doing here?

655
00:57:39,150 --> 00:57:41,050
Look like you would fight for our cave.

656
00:57:41,201 --> 00:57:44,692
Have you lost you mind? War is no place
for a girl. Let's get the hell out of here.

657
00:57:49,977 --> 00:57:52,514
We're gonna discuss this later.
- Let's hope.

658
00:58:18,162 --> 00:58:20,050
Oh, shit!

659
00:58:32,118 --> 00:58:33,683
Don't start fight without me!

660
00:59:09,917 --> 00:59:10,926
Jesus!

661
01:00:34,333 --> 01:00:35,870
Hey, Bork. Bork!

662
01:00:39,568 --> 01:00:42,400
It's awesome! That was awesome!

663
01:00:56,196 --> 01:01:00,841
Dad! Dad, are you OK?

664
01:01:00,876 --> 01:01:03,722
No, Ishbo, I'm not OK.

665
01:01:10,423 --> 01:01:14,814
I don't know, Dad.
It doesn't look so bad.

666
01:01:14,949 --> 01:01:18,311
I mean, I'm sure you hope, you'll...
I'm sure youll pull through 

667
01:01:21,259 --> 01:01:23,608
Come closer.

668
01:01:27,601 --> 01:01:32,435
Ishbo.
You always were an idiot.

669
01:01:37,926 --> 01:01:39,826
My fathers last words.

670
01:01:45,170 --> 01:01:46,633
Fardart, you saved my life!

671
01:01:51,061 --> 01:01:55,165
The Moonagongoons has set women
to fight their battles?

672
01:01:56,747 --> 01:02:00,157
I shall surely take pleasure in this spoil.

673
01:02:00,748 --> 01:02:04,504
<i>I was paralyzed with fear.
I turned to Thudnik to tell him that dad was dead,</i>

674
01:02:04,812 --> 01:02:08,350
<i>and Fardart had been kidnapped.
As the new head of the tribe, he took charge,</i>

675
01:02:08,450 --> 01:02:10,150
<i>in his own, inimitable fashion.</i>

676
01:02:10,285 --> 01:02:14,209
Retreat! Retreat!

677
01:02:26,176 --> 01:02:27,548
Thudnik!

678
01:02:38,263 --> 01:02:40,254
Get all the club back there.
Get all the club.

679
01:02:41,824 --> 01:02:44,977
We have to go save Fardart.
I can't believe you people.

680
01:02:44,980 --> 01:02:48,574
Get Fardart, will you? We gotta get out of here
before the Binadraks come.

681
01:02:48,629 --> 01:02:51,316
Wait a minute, wait a minute, didn't we just
go to war to defend this cave?

682
01:02:51,393 --> 01:02:53,693
Dad died for this cave. Now we just
all up and leaving?

683
01:02:53,774 --> 01:02:57,772
Oh, this awful cave? You father liked this place
but I never liked this place very much.

684
01:02:57,807 --> 01:03:00,529
Come on, get your little
inventions and let's go.

685
01:03:00,564 --> 01:03:03,470
I can't believe what I'm hearing.
Thudnik, Fardtart is your fart.

686
01:03:03,583 --> 01:03:06,183
Who knows what those Binadraks
are doing to her, right now.

687
01:03:06,198 --> 01:03:11,138
Exactly. You think I wanna touch that bitch again
after the Binadraks seed is spoiled her?

688
01:03:11,239 --> 01:03:14,264
Beside, plenty other women to club.

689
01:03:14,404 --> 01:03:16,112
Hey, what's up?

690
01:03:17,412 --> 01:03:19,112
You know what? I'm going to save her, then.

691
01:03:19,513 --> 01:03:23,941
Ishbo, you leave right now, and you'll be deem to deserter
and that's treason, which is punishable by death.

692
01:03:24,950 --> 01:03:26,150
Mom?

693
01:03:29,217 --> 01:03:30,359
Nice shot, mom.

694
01:03:35,132 --> 01:03:38,938
Well, if rescuing the woman that I love since childhood
is treason then I'm guilty as charged.

695
01:03:39,206 --> 01:03:43,008
Screw you, screw you,
screw all of you. Good bye.

696
01:03:43,264 --> 01:03:45,025
Ishbo, get back here.
- No, I'm going.

697
01:03:45,027 --> 01:03:46,629
Get back here, Ishbo!
- What can you do about it?

698
01:03:46,738 --> 01:03:49,900
Ishbo, get back here. - This is me leaving.
- Ishbo, come on guys, let's get him!

699
01:03:53,718 --> 01:03:57,047
You better .. Ishbo, if I ever
see you again, I'll kill you.

700
01:03:57,228 --> 01:03:58,727
You hear me?
Kill you.

701
01:04:02,566 --> 01:04:04,106
Pack it up. Come on.

702
01:04:08,153 --> 01:04:10,548
<i>The further I traveled
the clearer it became.</i>

703
01:04:10,670 --> 01:04:13,566
<i>I'd always assumed that the answer to
lifes riddles were so complicated.</i>

704
01:04:13,568 --> 01:04:16,563
<i>But could the meaning of life
really just be about love?</i>

705
01:04:17,119 --> 01:04:21,466
<i>Love was more powerful than a
charging wolly mammoth, a ruthless assassin spy,</i>

706
01:04:21,597 --> 01:04:22,560
<i>and a war.</i>

707
01:04:22,655 --> 01:04:25,635
<i>Once Fardart saw that Thudnik
and the tribe had abondoned her,</i>

708
01:04:25,874 --> 01:04:27,974
<i>and that I had risked life and limb to save her.</i>

709
01:04:28,017 --> 01:04:30,917
<i>I knew she would finally see that
I was the only man for her,</i>

710
01:04:31,105 --> 01:04:33,230
<i>And she, only woman for me.</i>

711
01:04:34,825 --> 01:04:38,128
Freeze!
Or die, male stranger.

712
01:04:46,276 --> 01:04:47,476
Me?

713
01:04:50,680 --> 01:04:51,780
Shit.

714
01:05:41,982 --> 01:05:46,951
Look at this pa-thetic excuse for male.
- This is a mistake. - Shut up.

715
01:05:52,610 --> 01:05:53,558
Release him.

716
01:05:58,888 --> 01:05:59,988
Idiot.

717
01:06:03,793 --> 01:06:07,549
Thank you, Ovaria.
Oestrogenia, Vixette and Titsia.

718
01:06:08,881 --> 01:06:14,131
So, what have we here?
A little worthless nibbling man.

719
01:06:15,152 --> 01:06:18,289
We, the citizens of Gynaecropolis
despise men.

720
01:06:19,703 --> 01:06:22,659
We were once members of other tribes,
tribes led by men.

721
01:06:23,826 --> 01:06:28,635
We were relentlessly clubbed and dragged into caves
against our will over and over again.

722
01:06:28,923 --> 01:06:30,823
Finally we said no more.

723
01:06:31,234 --> 01:06:34,253
We rosed up against our enslavers, killing them all.

724
01:06:34,548 --> 01:06:36,225
Creating our own tribe.

725
01:06:37,189 --> 01:06:41,619
Now we make love to each other,
with the tenderness and patience necessary.

726
01:06:41,761 --> 01:06:45,992
So that each member of our tribe
achieves multi orgasmic satisfaction.

727
01:06:47,780 --> 01:06:48,980
Really?

728
01:06:50,817 --> 01:06:56,667
Now we travel primitive landscape, liberating every woman
we meet, and killing every man.

729
01:06:56,872 --> 01:07:00,032
Listen, I'm not like other cave man, OK?

730
01:07:00,178 --> 01:07:03,204
I'm anti-clubbing. I always have been.
What, I'm serious.

731
01:07:03,251 --> 01:07:07,426
I've had many many conversations with
my own tribe about this very clubbing issiue.

732
01:07:08,099 --> 01:07:11,803
I see men and women is equal.
I don't wanna club a girl over the head.

733
01:07:11,992 --> 01:07:14,832
I wanna get to know her.
And then if a romantic sparking night,

734
01:07:14,900 --> 01:07:17,644
I want the physical
component of our relationship

735
01:07:17,828 --> 01:07:20,742
to be an organic expression
of our compatibility.

736
01:07:22,939 --> 01:07:24,668
Are you shitting me or you're for real?

737
01:07:26,103 --> 01:07:27,803
No, it's a 100% for real.

738
01:07:28,068 --> 01:07:31,994
Allright, I left my own tribe for oppressing me
just like you guys do it with you tribes.

739
01:07:35,785 --> 01:07:37,585
You are in luck, wimpy man.

740
01:07:38,020 --> 01:07:40,720
I've decided just to spear you pathetic life.

741
01:07:42,591 --> 01:07:46,849
Thank you, I really appreciate that, thank you.
And you know what?

742
01:07:46,949 --> 01:07:51,034
Under one condition: You impregnate
every woman in this tribe.

743
01:07:51,450 --> 01:07:54,389
You know, I really don't have the time right now.
I'm sorry, what did you say?

744
01:07:54,692 --> 01:07:59,949
Because your nature is clearly that of a wuss.
I see as a non-threatening male.

745
01:08:00,084 --> 01:08:05,651
Therefore I have chosen you to
sleep with every woman in this tribe,

746
01:08:06,584 --> 01:08:11,549
that's insure propogation of our kind.
You will start with me.

747
01:08:11,796 --> 01:08:17,951
But first ladies, scrub his filty penis,
asshole and balls.

748
01:09:04,961 --> 01:09:07,475
Wait, wait, I have to tell you something.
- What?

749
01:09:08,671 --> 01:09:13,003
I can't believe I'm about to say this.
But, I don't think I can do this.

750
01:09:14,574 --> 01:09:18,260
So you're a fag.
- No, I'm in love with another woman.

751
01:09:19,518 --> 01:09:23,419
And I've left my entire tribe behind and
everything I've ever known.

752
01:09:24,741 --> 01:09:27,056
And... you're extremely hot.

753
01:09:28,025 --> 01:09:31,616
And the members of your tribe are very hot.

754
01:09:32,482 --> 01:09:34,283
I would love

755
01:09:35,363 --> 01:09:38,420
to have sex with you, guys.

756
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:42,869
I'm just afraid that, if I do, that'll be cheating on her.

757
01:09:43,231 --> 01:09:45,931
And I can't do that to the woman I love.

758
01:09:46,690 --> 01:09:50,883
You've all been so nice,
and... Thanks for everything.

759
01:09:51,018 --> 01:09:52,226
And I'm really really sorry.

760
01:09:52,410 --> 01:09:56,105
But, thanks, but no thanks.

761
01:09:56,416 --> 01:09:59,585
Why, you little worm?

762
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:07,254
Queen Fallopia offers you a flawless body,
and all you can say is thanks, but no thanks?

763
01:10:07,960 --> 01:10:11,451
Do you do how many men have literally died
trying to get into this loincloth.

764
01:10:11,486 --> 01:10:16,129
And I offer to you as a gift of a lifetime
and you say thanks, but no thanks?

765
01:10:17,782 --> 01:10:18,925
You're a dead man.

766
01:10:26,772 --> 01:10:27,715
My nail!

767
01:10:31,623 --> 01:10:34,105
Come here, you little, man.

768
01:10:39,650 --> 01:10:41,050
Get him!

769
01:11:00,260 --> 01:11:01,660
Men!

770
01:11:10,558 --> 01:11:13,540
<i>Those Gynaecropolistes had totally
thrown me off course.</i>

771
01:11:13,908 --> 01:11:16,608
<i>I wondered the desert for days completely lost.</i>

772
01:11:16,765 --> 01:11:20,665
<i>If I didn't finf those Binadraks soon,
I was vulture meat for sure.</i>

773
01:11:56,160 --> 01:11:57,634
What the hell are you doin'?

774
01:11:58,734 --> 01:12:02,692
Did you know the difference
between water and sand?

775
01:12:12,418 --> 01:12:14,418
It must've been a mirage.

776
01:12:16,269 --> 01:12:19,390
Is that really you dad,
or are you a mirage, too?

777
01:12:20,053 --> 01:12:23,863
What the hell do you think?
I got my head onto my arm.

778
01:12:24,189 --> 01:12:27,428
But, you look so real.
- Ishbo,

779
01:12:29,420 --> 01:12:31,420
I'm sorry, I called you an idiot.

780
01:12:33,975 --> 01:12:36,975
- Thanks, dad.
- You're actually complete moron.

781
01:12:37,220 --> 01:12:40,521
Turning your back on the tribe,
risking you life with the Binadraks,

782
01:12:41,014 --> 01:12:46,088
Blowin' absolute guaranteed ass
from those incredible Amazon chicks,

783
01:12:46,962 --> 01:12:48,362
And for what?

784
01:12:48,887 --> 01:12:50,987
A woman doesn't even love you.

785
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:54,700
Turn back, Ishbo.

786
01:12:55,481 --> 01:12:57,349
Turn back.

787
01:12:58,253 --> 01:13:02,387
You know what? I'm tired of you
always criticising and calling me stupid.

788
01:13:03,113 --> 01:13:07,161
Who is the one who's got his head
still attached, ha? Me. Not you, me.

789
01:13:07,597 --> 01:13:10,523
You know what, she will love me.
You'll see.

790
01:13:10,555 --> 01:13:12,655
You're completely full of shit.

791
01:13:27,443 --> 01:13:30,283
<i>Though my father was constantly
mean to me when he was alive,</i>

792
01:13:30,362 --> 01:13:33,023
<i>in death, he did made
a favour of a lifetime.</i>

793
01:13:33,025 --> 01:13:35,785
<i>Inadvertently, led me to
Binadraks headquarters.</i>

794
01:13:35,814 --> 01:13:37,414
<i>Thanks, dad.</i>

795
01:14:03,877 --> 01:14:07,229
It's me. It's me.
Fardart, it's me.

796
01:14:08,494 --> 01:14:12,337
Ishie? What the hell you doing here?
- I'm here to rescue you.

797
01:14:12,372 --> 01:14:14,513
Rescue me?
- Yeah, Thudnik was pathetic.

798
01:14:14,613 --> 01:14:17,406
He turn tail and ran like a coward.
The whole tribe followed him.

799
01:14:17,457 --> 01:14:20,588
I tried to across the whole desert
just to save you. All by myself.

800
01:14:21,061 --> 01:14:24,320
Why would you do anything like that?
- Because I love you, Fardart.

801
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:27,263
I love you so much.
And I finally figured out

802
01:14:27,588 --> 01:14:32,568
the only thing that matters, the answer to every question
and the most powerful force in all of nature,

803
01:14:33,336 --> 01:14:34,536
is love.

804
01:14:35,299 --> 01:14:36,699
Kiss me.

805
01:14:39,684 --> 01:14:43,007
What's the matter? I thought we're supposed to kiss
and I'm gonna rescue you and we're gonna run away

806
01:14:43,042 --> 01:14:45,353
and set up on tribe and we're gonna live
happily ever after.

807
01:14:45,453 --> 01:14:47,651
I'm glad you worked out of these whole
little fantasy for yourself.

808
01:14:47,975 --> 01:14:51,171
But anything gonna happen.
Who said that I wanted to be rescued?

809
01:14:52,593 --> 01:14:55,311
These Binadraks are way better than
Moonagongoons ever were.

810
01:14:55,786 --> 01:14:58,886
I'm married to a bigger, stronger, better looking
chief than Thudnik ever was.

811
01:14:59,176 --> 01:15:01,247
We have more food, much bigger cave,

812
01:15:01,948 --> 01:15:03,846
He's a much bigger club,
if you know what I mean.

813
01:15:04,748 --> 01:15:10,193
Plus, I got these.
- What have they done to you?

814
01:15:10,664 --> 01:15:12,473
Quit with the pollyanna routine already.

815
01:15:12,919 --> 01:15:15,912
It's survival of a fetus out here.
And as first lady of the Binadraks,

816
01:15:16,012 --> 01:15:19,735
I intend to do what ever is necessary
to gurantee my place the evolutionary chain.

817
01:15:21,092 --> 01:15:23,191
You know what? They brainwashed you.
You have no idea what you're saying.

818
01:15:23,192 --> 01:15:24,097
Come on, I'm rescuing you.

819
01:15:24,270 --> 01:15:26,571
- Come on, we're going.
- Let go!

820
01:15:28,902 --> 01:15:30,791
Moonagongoons spy!

821
01:15:31,395 --> 01:15:35,029
Moonagongoons spy!
- Kill him now!

822
01:15:40,392 --> 01:15:41,301
Hurry.

823
01:16:12,833 --> 01:16:15,306
- Queen Fallopia!
- The wussy man!

824
01:16:15,341 --> 01:16:18,091
Oh, you little...
- Get him ladies.

825
01:16:42,562 --> 01:16:44,571
Holy crap, is that Ishbo?

826
01:16:46,512 --> 01:16:47,433
Let's get him.

827
01:17:00,615 --> 01:17:03,419
I'm wore-out, goddamn it.
This is bullshit.

828
01:17:24,448 --> 01:17:26,256
<i>And I was at this moment that I realized</i>

829
01:17:26,883 --> 01:17:28,357
<i>Maybe everybody was right all alone.</i>

830
01:17:29,096 --> 01:17:33,011
<i>Maybe striving to evolve beyond
our a lot of sticks and stones was a fool's errand.</i>

831
01:17:34,221 --> 01:17:37,275
<i>Maybe we were just destined
to be small tribes wondering the plains.</i>

832
01:17:38,242 --> 01:17:40,890
<i>Leaving no indelible mark
on history whatsoever.</i>

833
01:17:51,954 --> 01:17:54,365
2 MILLON YEARS LATER

834
01:17:58,179 --> 01:18:02,388
All paleolithic people
lived by hunting and gathering.

835
01:18:03,419 --> 01:18:06,834
Would you stop doodling please
and look at me. Thank you.

836
01:18:07,510 --> 01:18:13,732
Hunting and gathering.
That means no TV dinners, no fast fries.

837
01:18:15,332 --> 01:18:18,000
They lived around 2 million to
400 thousand years ago.

838
01:18:18,341 --> 01:18:21,508
Come this way, I'm gonna
show you an exquisite example

839
01:18:21,891 --> 01:18:24,991
of everyday prehistoric life
around the communal cave.

840
01:18:25,298 --> 01:18:28,266
Now there is no gameboy,
no Ice Box, no cell phone.

841
01:18:28,635 --> 01:18:32,472
Life everyday was a constant
struggle just to survive.

842
01:18:33,293 --> 01:18:38,451
Now, using actual bones, the express
from the museum have reconstruck him,

843
01:18:38,551 --> 01:18:41,489
what there cave peoples
probably look like.

844
01:18:42,247 --> 01:18:43,647
Short and fat.

845
01:18:43,751 --> 01:18:44,607
This way, please.

846
01:18:46,102 --> 01:18:49,499
I wanna show you over here--
Turn the cell phone off please.

847
01:18:54,470 --> 01:18:55,653
Well, I turns out I was right.

848
01:18:56,053 --> 01:18:58,435
Human beings did have
the potential to evolve after all.

849
01:18:59,213 --> 01:19:02,000
Of course if that's good luck, it does mean now
I'm trapped in a museum,

850
01:19:02,050 --> 01:19:03,777
and kids throw their gum at me.

851
01:19:04,475 --> 01:19:07,967
You know, sometimes I do think about my
inventions and my tribe and Fardart.

852
01:19:08,635 --> 01:19:11,173
But this point I really only have one regret.

853
01:19:12,395 --> 01:19:15,836
I died, only ever having
had sex with a monkey.

854
01:19:23,862 --> 01:19:28,252
I'm not dead yet, you
motherfucker and asshole, cocksucker...

855
01:19:29,053 --> 01:19:34,353
