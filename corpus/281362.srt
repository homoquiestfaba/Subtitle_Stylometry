1
00:02:29,426 --> 00:02:32,486
<i>It has come down to this.
Eight seconds to go.</i>

2
00:02:32,696 --> 00:02:35,358
One possession.
Marv Albert with Bill Walton...

3
00:02:35,432 --> 00:02:38,492
...from the America West Arena
in Phoenix, Arizona.

4
00:02:38,635 --> 00:02:41,195
l can't hear myself over the crowd.

5
00:02:41,304 --> 00:02:44,296
<i>If the Suns win they go to the finals.
If they lose...</i>

6
00:02:44,841 --> 00:02:46,968
...they go back to San Antonio.

7
00:02:47,044 --> 00:02:48,306
We got eight seconds.

8
00:02:48,445 --> 00:02:50,276
Lots of time for the straight line.

9
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:54,510
Majerle, take the ball, get it to KJ,
and get through.

10
00:02:54,785 --> 00:02:57,276
Kick it back to Chuck. And Chuck...

11
00:02:57,554 --> 00:02:59,852
- ...you win the game.
- Get me the ball.

12
00:03:00,524 --> 00:03:02,458
No time outs left. Let's go.

13
00:03:02,526 --> 00:03:03,458
Suns!

14
00:03:03,627 --> 00:03:06,152
<i>This is what it's all about,
game-winning time.</i>

15
00:03:06,229 --> 00:03:09,721
<i>- I'm looking for Barkley to step up.
- What a shock!</i>

16
00:03:10,133 --> 00:03:13,296
<i>For those who just tuned in,
Robinson fouled out.</i>

17
00:03:13,904 --> 00:03:17,203
<i>For the Admiral, 43 points, 21 rebounds.</i>

18
00:03:17,941 --> 00:03:19,499
<i>Here we go. Dan Majerle...</i>

19
00:03:19,576 --> 00:03:21,271
<i>...will inbound the basketball.</i>

20
00:03:21,344 --> 00:03:25,337
<i>The Suns, one possession from elimination.
They're going wild.</i>

21
00:03:26,817 --> 00:03:29,149
<i>Kevin Johnson takes it, moves to the right.</i>

22
00:03:29,219 --> 00:03:31,585
<i>Johnson setting it up, looking for Barkley.</i>

23
00:03:31,888 --> 00:03:33,378
<i>We're down to six.</i>

24
00:03:33,557 --> 00:03:35,252
<i>Barkley angles for the shot.</i>

25
00:03:35,892 --> 00:03:37,553
<i>Barkley, to his left.</i>

26
00:03:37,627 --> 00:03:39,117
<i>Barkley, checking the clock.</i>

27
00:03:39,362 --> 00:03:41,227
<i>Barkley, with the release.</i>

28
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:47,996
<i>It's all over. Charles Barkley has put
the Phoenix Suns in the NBA finals.</i>

29
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:50,734
<i>The most dramatic victory...</i>

30
00:03:50,841 --> 00:03:53,969
<i>...in the history in the Suns' franchise.</i>

31
00:03:57,681 --> 00:04:01,242
No basket! The shot was after the buzzer.
Game's over.

32
00:04:01,518 --> 00:04:04,180
- Are you crazy?
- No! Charles, you didn't get it off.

33
00:04:04,688 --> 00:04:06,121
- Bullshit.
- You were late.

34
00:04:06,189 --> 00:04:07,349
He was late.

35
00:04:07,424 --> 00:04:08,413
He got it off!

36
00:04:08,492 --> 00:04:09,322
He didn't.

37
00:04:13,063 --> 00:04:15,327
- You're wrong!
- You didn't get it off!

38
00:04:15,398 --> 00:04:18,390
- That is total bullshit.
- Watch yourself, Charles.

39
00:04:18,568 --> 00:04:21,230
- You were late.
- Jack called it good. Ask for help.

40
00:04:21,371 --> 00:04:24,033
l don't need any help. You didn't get it off!

41
00:04:24,107 --> 00:04:25,438
Bullshit.

42
00:04:25,709 --> 00:04:27,973
You want to play next game?
Watch yourself.

43
00:04:28,044 --> 00:04:29,534
You suck. You suck.

44
00:04:29,713 --> 00:04:32,705
Watch yourself. No basket. Game's over.

45
00:04:32,883 --> 00:04:35,181
l don't want to protect you, but l must.

46
00:04:35,352 --> 00:04:37,013
Bullshit! Bullshit!

47
00:04:40,757 --> 00:04:44,659
The crowd appears to be voicing
its displeasure.

48
00:04:45,162 --> 00:04:46,993
Hey, Charles!

49
00:04:47,564 --> 00:04:49,759
l'll see you in San Antonio.

50
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:52,165
You'll see me kick your ass!

51
00:04:53,637 --> 00:04:55,901
l wouldn't want
to be Mickey Gordon tonight...

52
00:04:55,972 --> 00:04:58,998
...or any other night
the rest of my life here in Phoenix.

53
00:04:59,176 --> 00:05:01,508
l hope you die!

54
00:05:01,678 --> 00:05:02,576
Need help?

55
00:05:02,646 --> 00:05:05,012
- l saw it. He was late.
- Let's get you out.

56
00:05:05,148 --> 00:05:06,479
This isn't my jacket.

57
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:09,114
Screw your jacket. Let's go.

58
00:05:09,186 --> 00:05:13,850
<i>As Mickey Gordon leaves, you can only
think that as long as they play basketball...</i>

59
00:05:14,224 --> 00:05:17,284
<i>...they'll talk about that controversial call.</i>

60
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,760
<i>For Bill Walton, I'm Marv Albert.</i>

61
00:05:20,564 --> 00:05:24,227
<i>As a sports writer for 20 years,
I've covered every great event there is.</i>

62
00:05:24,301 --> 00:05:27,566
<i>And I'm watching my best friend
make the gutsiest call...</i>

63
00:05:27,704 --> 00:05:29,797
<i>...in the history of basketball.</i>

64
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:32,938
<i>Every news show in America ran it
for two days.</i>

65
00:05:33,009 --> 00:05:36,445
<i>Don't sit Gordon and Barkley together
at a dinner party.</i>

66
00:05:36,513 --> 00:05:38,811
<i>The sports world is still stunned...</i>

67
00:05:38,882 --> 00:05:40,645
<i>...by this controversial call.</i>

68
00:05:40,717 --> 00:05:45,450
<i>Gordon remains in seclusion
under police guard. But bravo, Mickey!</i>

69
00:05:45,555 --> 00:05:49,457
<i>We need such leadership
and decision-making in the White House.</i>

70
00:05:51,094 --> 00:05:54,257
<i>No news, no weather,
no theatre reviews, just that...</i>

71
00:05:54,364 --> 00:05:57,197
...over and over again.
And you know what?

72
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,892
Mickey got it right.
Right there, live on the spot.

73
00:06:01,071 --> 00:06:02,163
He got it right.

74
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:05,174
The shot was late
by a hundredth of a second.

75
00:06:05,242 --> 00:06:06,402
Oh, God.

76
00:06:07,544 --> 00:06:09,808
Honey, that's an amazing story.

77
00:06:10,046 --> 00:06:13,482
lf only l liked basketball,
I’d have really liked it.

78
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:15,311
I’m kidding.

79
00:06:15,485 --> 00:06:17,578
Welcome to Helen's. Something to drink?

80
00:06:17,687 --> 00:06:22,454
- Champagne, when the others arrive.
- We're getting married.

81
00:06:23,059 --> 00:06:24,185
Fine with me.

82
00:06:24,861 --> 00:06:26,089
How's the house wine?

83
00:06:26,329 --> 00:06:29,025
lt's like me: fruity, yet oddly appealing.

84
00:06:29,566 --> 00:06:31,158
We'll wait.

85
00:06:31,568 --> 00:06:33,536
He'll wait. l'll have a glass of red.

86
00:06:33,837 --> 00:06:35,236
You got it.

87
00:06:36,306 --> 00:06:39,036
- I’m a little nervous, all right?
- About what?

88
00:06:39,209 --> 00:06:40,938
Meeting your friends.

89
00:06:41,344 --> 00:06:45,246
They're flying in to New York
from all over the country...

90
00:06:45,515 --> 00:06:46,948
...to look at me.

91
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:48,744
l'll feel like a show horse.

92
00:06:48,952 --> 00:06:52,353
They'll love you.
Craig and Lucy were wild for you.

93
00:06:53,757 --> 00:06:56,453
Mickey's great. l can't wait
for you to meet him.

94
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:58,919
l tell you, it's unbelievable.

95
00:06:59,262 --> 00:07:03,323
Three months ago, I’m this confirmed
single dope living in New York...

96
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:07,336
...writing for the paper l delivered as a kid,
and l get your fax.

97
00:07:07,504 --> 00:07:09,267
One little number off.

98
00:07:09,606 --> 00:07:12,268
- And, bing! We both are--
- l know.

99
00:07:12,475 --> 00:07:15,774
Then l started faxing you
and you start faxing me.

100
00:07:15,979 --> 00:07:18,106
Then pretty soon we're just...

101
00:07:18,214 --> 00:07:20,011
...faxing each other's brains out.

102
00:07:23,119 --> 00:07:24,017
House red.

103
00:07:24,421 --> 00:07:25,251
Thanks.

104
00:07:25,355 --> 00:07:29,553
lt must be the strangest way for
two people to get together l ever heard of.

105
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:31,649
No.

106
00:07:33,129 --> 00:07:36,792
Mickey and Ellen hold the title
for the strangest getting together.

107
00:07:36,866 --> 00:07:38,561
At least in their weight class.

108
00:07:38,635 --> 00:07:40,102
How did they get together?

109
00:07:40,804 --> 00:07:42,396
She helped bury his father.

110
00:07:44,107 --> 00:07:45,096
Excuse me?

111
00:07:46,309 --> 00:07:48,709
No. l'll wait for Mickey to tell that story.

112
00:07:50,046 --> 00:07:51,946
Wait. Are you crazy?

113
00:07:52,315 --> 00:07:56,877
You can't start a story, ''She helped bury
his father'' and stop. lt's not allowed.

114
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,385
- Come on.
- All right, all right. Here we go.

115
00:08:00,824 --> 00:08:02,291
This was a few years ago.

116
00:08:03,593 --> 00:08:05,083
Mickey's father died.

117
00:08:05,428 --> 00:08:07,157
lt's good. Mickey hated him.

118
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:08,158
What?

119
00:08:08,231 --> 00:08:11,462
Everybody did. He left his family
when Mickey was a kid.

120
00:08:11,935 --> 00:08:14,768
When he left,
the neighbourhood had a street fair.

121
00:08:14,904 --> 00:08:17,202
l won a fishing rod.
Best time we ever had.

122
00:08:17,941 --> 00:08:20,000
Anyway, he dies...

123
00:08:20,143 --> 00:08:21,235
...finally.

124
00:08:21,611 --> 00:08:25,012
And the funeral service is
in the cargo area at JFK.

125
00:08:25,348 --> 00:08:26,337
<i>Why?</i>

126
00:08:26,649 --> 00:08:28,640
<i>He wants to be buried in France.</i>

127
00:08:28,718 --> 00:08:31,448
<i>- Was he French?
- No. He was in the D-day invasion.</i>

128
00:08:31,755 --> 00:08:34,417
<i>I think on our side, but I'm not sure.</i>

129
00:08:34,657 --> 00:08:38,252
<i>His whole platoon, except him,
was wiped out defending a village.</i>

130
00:08:38,328 --> 00:08:41,388
<i>They were buried there and he wanted
to be buried with them.</i>

131
00:08:41,631 --> 00:08:43,223
<i>That's sweet.</i>

132
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,765
<i>Okay.</i>

133
00:08:45,402 --> 00:08:49,930
<i>So, Mickey has to go over and accompany
the body, and see that it gets buried.</i>

134
00:08:50,473 --> 00:08:52,464
<i>Why, if he was such a bad guy?</i>

135
00:08:52,642 --> 00:08:57,136
<i>Whatever his father had done to him,
Mickey wanted to have a clear conscience.</i>

136
00:08:58,014 --> 00:08:59,481
<i>That's Mickey.</i>

137
00:09:00,316 --> 00:09:03,251
<i>Then there was this little problem.</i>

138
00:09:03,586 --> 00:09:05,315
You lost my father?

139
00:09:06,089 --> 00:09:07,078
<i>Oui.</i>

140
00:09:07,223 --> 00:09:09,748
We're not talking about a Valpac here.

141
00:09:09,993 --> 00:09:14,453
We're talking about a former person
in a bad suit in a big wooden box...

142
00:09:14,531 --> 00:09:16,829
<i>...and all you can say to me is ''oui''?</i>

143
00:09:18,601 --> 00:09:22,128
<i>He's going crazy,
but he's trying not to go off on anyone.</i>

144
00:09:22,305 --> 00:09:26,469
<i>This guy argues for a living.
He'd tell Shaquille O'Neal to shut up.</i>

145
00:09:26,743 --> 00:09:28,973
<i>He doesn't want to be the Ugly American.</i>

146
00:09:29,045 --> 00:09:30,740
Can l see your superior?

147
00:09:31,448 --> 00:09:32,472
Please...

148
00:09:32,816 --> 00:09:37,276
l know you're all angry over Euro Disney,
but don't take it out on me.

149
00:09:39,489 --> 00:09:40,547
Okay.

150
00:09:41,891 --> 00:09:44,826
Whatever you do,
l am not going to lose my temper.

151
00:09:45,361 --> 00:09:46,385
<i>Finally...</i>

152
00:09:46,463 --> 00:09:48,931
lf l was Hitler, you'd give me my father.

153
00:09:49,165 --> 00:09:53,067
You'd give me everything
in your goddamn country. Where is he?

154
00:09:54,637 --> 00:09:56,070
<i>Two days.</i>

155
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,273
<i>Two days?</i>

156
00:09:58,341 --> 00:10:01,174
<i>He was in that airport two days.</i>

157
00:10:05,448 --> 00:10:06,779
<i>Monsieur Gordon...</i>

158
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:09,050
Will you come with me, please?

159
00:10:10,553 --> 00:10:12,248
<i>But the airline was nice.</i>

160
00:10:12,622 --> 00:10:14,180
<i>They gave him free almonds.</i>

161
00:10:22,866 --> 00:10:24,595
<i>Where does Ellen come in?</i>

162
00:10:25,068 --> 00:10:26,126
<i>Now.</i>

163
00:10:42,352 --> 00:10:43,319
Mr. Gordon...

164
00:10:43,553 --> 00:10:45,043
...I’m Miss Andrews.

165
00:10:45,488 --> 00:10:47,353
Would you come into my office?

166
00:10:53,997 --> 00:10:55,487
Please have a seat.

167
00:10:57,066 --> 00:10:58,897
How are you feeling today?

168
00:10:59,135 --> 00:11:02,104
How am l today? l am a mass of good will.

169
00:11:02,438 --> 00:11:04,167
- You're American.
- Yes.

170
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:07,639
On behalf of the airline,
l apologize for any problem--

171
00:11:07,844 --> 00:11:10,335
Problem? There's no problem.

172
00:11:10,513 --> 00:11:12,947
You lost my father. My rear end's...

173
00:11:13,082 --> 00:11:15,516
...moulded to a plastic chair
and I’ve got gas...

174
00:11:15,685 --> 00:11:20,019
...from eating those almonds.
I’m so happy I’m a walking Mardi Gras.

175
00:11:20,423 --> 00:11:21,720
That's funny.

176
00:11:21,858 --> 00:11:25,350
You have a delightfully sharp way
of expressing yourself.

177
00:11:25,962 --> 00:11:28,396
A terrible thing has been done to you...

178
00:11:28,498 --> 00:11:32,730
...and we really are sorry.
You've every right to insult, belittle...

179
00:11:32,869 --> 00:11:35,394
...and abuse the staff
who have tried to help you.

180
00:11:35,738 --> 00:11:37,069
ln fact, we thank you.

181
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:40,405
And we voted you Traveller of the Month,
so congratulations.

182
00:11:42,245 --> 00:11:44,042
Anything else you'd like to say?

183
00:11:45,348 --> 00:11:46,940
No, l think that's it.

184
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:50,114
Good. We found your father.

185
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:53,485
The coffin landed here,
but evidently it was mis-tagged.

186
00:11:53,623 --> 00:11:56,251
- You should always tip more at the curb.
- Definitely.

187
00:11:56,326 --> 00:11:59,489
- lt accidentally was sent to Switzerland.
- Switzerland?

188
00:11:59,562 --> 00:12:01,792
- We had trouble with them.
- They're vicious.

189
00:12:01,998 --> 00:12:05,900
- They punched holes in my cheese.
- l thought they were neutral.

190
00:12:06,069 --> 00:12:09,368
They held your father in quarantine
for health reasons.

191
00:12:09,439 --> 00:12:13,773
Health reasons? He's dead.
He has no health. He's been de-healthed.

192
00:12:22,585 --> 00:12:25,577
There he is. Okay? Let's get out of here.

193
00:12:25,755 --> 00:12:26,813
Well...

194
00:12:29,259 --> 00:12:30,851
Do you have the claim checks?

195
00:12:30,927 --> 00:12:31,916
Why?

196
00:12:32,095 --> 00:12:37,032
Are there two of these that look alike?
My coffin has red yarn on the handle.

197
00:12:38,401 --> 00:12:40,392
What are you doing?

198
00:12:40,603 --> 00:12:42,798
We must make sure
that this is your father.

199
00:12:43,106 --> 00:12:47,839
lf it's a mad little guy giving you the finger,
it's him. Don't make me look.

200
00:12:49,112 --> 00:12:52,741
Sorry, but with all the confusion
l need you to identify him.

201
00:12:54,017 --> 00:12:57,646
Then put him on his stomach,
because I’m used to seeing him walk away.

202
00:12:58,454 --> 00:12:59,716
Right.

203
00:13:00,456 --> 00:13:01,480
Okay?

204
00:13:01,791 --> 00:13:02,951
Okay.

205
00:13:03,526 --> 00:13:06,791
That's enough. It'll be fine. Come on.

206
00:13:18,641 --> 00:13:19,630
Waiter?

207
00:13:21,644 --> 00:13:22,838
That looks good.

208
00:13:26,482 --> 00:13:27,813
Are you alone?

209
00:13:27,884 --> 00:13:30,079
Alone? l don't even have silverware.

210
00:13:30,219 --> 00:13:32,312
- Sit down.
- Thanks.

211
00:13:32,789 --> 00:13:35,053
What exactly is that?

212
00:13:35,558 --> 00:13:36,547
This?

213
00:13:36,659 --> 00:13:37,990
l don't know.

214
00:13:38,494 --> 00:13:41,861
l thought l ordered a martini,
but they brought me a backyard.

215
00:13:42,632 --> 00:13:45,032
Are you hungry?
Can l order you the wrong thing?

216
00:13:45,101 --> 00:13:47,569
No, thank you, I’m on my way out.

217
00:13:47,637 --> 00:13:49,901
Yeah, l noticed. Auto show?

218
00:13:50,373 --> 00:13:53,035
No, actually I’m going to the opera.

219
00:13:53,676 --> 00:13:56,201
Don't leave until the fat lady sings.

220
00:13:57,513 --> 00:13:59,174
No, l never do.

221
00:13:59,882 --> 00:14:01,873
Waiter, please, this is--

222
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,951
lt's a loaner. l had no jacket.

223
00:14:06,322 --> 00:14:07,949
Right. l guessed.

224
00:14:08,224 --> 00:14:12,285
lt's a good look for me, don't you think?
Sort of the Ellis lsland Collection?

225
00:14:12,695 --> 00:14:13,753
lt's you.

226
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:15,693
And l don't even know you.

227
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:22,270
l really have to go. l wanted to tell you
that everything is taken care of.

228
00:14:22,672 --> 00:14:24,799
We'll deliver the casket to the cemetery.

229
00:14:24,874 --> 00:14:26,569
A car'll pick you up at 8:00...

230
00:14:26,642 --> 00:14:28,576
...and bring you back to the airport.

231
00:14:28,644 --> 00:14:31,636
We've upgraded your ticket to first class.

232
00:14:31,981 --> 00:14:34,176
And the ticket is free both ways.

233
00:14:34,617 --> 00:14:37,051
That's supposed to make up
for losing my father?

234
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:39,051
We'll also pay your hotel bill.

235
00:14:39,222 --> 00:14:40,655
Yes!

236
00:14:43,893 --> 00:14:46,726
Well, l'll leave you in your grief.

237
00:14:47,263 --> 00:14:50,130
Will anyone else need transportation
to the cemetery?

238
00:14:50,199 --> 00:14:52,531
No. l will be the only one there.

239
00:14:53,169 --> 00:14:54,397
Oh, how sad.

240
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:56,435
Good, 'cause it's a funeral.

241
00:14:57,173 --> 00:14:58,162
Right.

242
00:14:59,876 --> 00:15:00,808
'Bye-bye.

243
00:15:02,478 --> 00:15:04,241
Miss Andrews...

244
00:15:08,317 --> 00:15:10,080
l just wanted to thank you...

245
00:15:10,253 --> 00:15:13,313
...not just for the plane and the car,
but for today...

246
00:15:13,489 --> 00:15:15,184
...you know, with my father.

247
00:15:15,491 --> 00:15:17,425
You were really understanding.

248
00:15:17,693 --> 00:15:19,684
lt was the least l could do.

249
00:15:19,829 --> 00:15:21,990
Anyway. Good-bye, Mr. Gordon.

250
00:15:22,498 --> 00:15:25,092
lt's in there somewhere. There you go.

251
00:15:47,523 --> 00:15:48,956
lt's my father.

252
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,289
He fought in the war here.

253
00:15:55,765 --> 00:15:58,063
These were his buddies.

254
00:16:08,578 --> 00:16:10,170
Well, you're here.

255
00:16:12,081 --> 00:16:14,174
l brought you here like you wanted.

256
00:16:29,765 --> 00:16:32,563
Thanks for not getting killed
so l could be born.

257
00:16:51,187 --> 00:16:52,779
That was very sweet.

258
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:56,283
What are you doing here?

259
00:16:56,425 --> 00:16:59,019
Nobody should bury their father alone.

260
00:17:01,931 --> 00:17:02,920
I’m Mickey.

261
00:17:03,599 --> 00:17:04,588
Ellen.

262
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:09,201
Do you come here often?

263
00:17:24,887 --> 00:17:27,048
You'd have been better off
in the limousine.

264
00:17:27,123 --> 00:17:29,318
I’m much more comfortable here.

265
00:17:32,628 --> 00:17:35,222
l take it you and your father
weren't very close.

266
00:17:36,132 --> 00:17:37,895
No, he left when l was 10.

267
00:17:38,067 --> 00:17:40,729
l'll never forget the last thing he said.

268
00:17:40,903 --> 00:17:42,336
''Get out of my way.''

269
00:17:42,471 --> 00:17:44,234
You can't buy memories like that.

270
00:17:44,307 --> 00:17:45,865
l suppose not.

271
00:17:47,143 --> 00:17:50,909
You'll be at the airport in 90 minutes.
The drive's a breeze.

272
00:17:51,147 --> 00:17:53,138
I’d never say something like that.

273
00:17:53,349 --> 00:17:55,146
- Like what?
- Like, ''lt's a breeze.''

274
00:17:55,351 --> 00:17:58,980
I’m superstitious and that's like begging
for disaster.

275
00:17:59,155 --> 00:18:02,750
lt's like those old war movies.
After the battle they sit around and talk...

276
00:18:02,825 --> 00:18:05,817
...about going home,
and there's a guy named Brooklyn.

277
00:18:05,895 --> 00:18:10,491
''When l get home l'll go to see
my Dodgers, get me a nice hot dog...''

278
00:18:15,438 --> 00:18:16,871
lt always happened, right?

279
00:18:16,939 --> 00:18:20,500
lf ever l get on a small plane
and there's a storm, l never say:

280
00:18:20,643 --> 00:18:22,634
''Piece of cake.''

281
00:18:22,878 --> 00:18:26,143
Never say, ''Famous last words,''
because they could be.

282
00:18:27,617 --> 00:18:29,608
You're a disturbed person, right?

283
00:18:29,885 --> 00:18:32,115
You have no idea.

284
00:18:32,922 --> 00:18:36,517
<i>According to him, he was working hard
all the way back to Paris.</i>

285
00:18:36,826 --> 00:18:40,159
<i>You know those Japanese movies
with dinosaurs in the streets...</i>

286
00:18:41,097 --> 00:18:44,430
...and those people just run out
and wait to get stepped on?

287
00:18:48,704 --> 00:18:52,299
<i>He's got the charm turned up
to warp factor 7...</i>

288
00:18:52,475 --> 00:18:55,911
<i>...and she seems to like him,
but he's not sure.</i>

289
00:18:56,946 --> 00:18:59,540
l never knew that about Wilt Chamberlain.

290
00:18:59,649 --> 00:19:01,879
They say it's true, but you know...

291
00:19:02,051 --> 00:19:05,487
- l had a great time.
- Thank you for everything.

292
00:19:05,655 --> 00:19:07,646
We must stop meeting like this.

293
00:19:12,161 --> 00:19:13,560
Take care of yourself.

294
00:19:15,264 --> 00:19:16,492
Okay.

295
00:19:17,066 --> 00:19:18,465
Have a good flight.

296
00:19:21,837 --> 00:19:23,998
- Can l ask you a question?
- Sure.

297
00:19:24,173 --> 00:19:29,076
- ls this ticket only for this afternoon?
- lt's for any time. Want to change it?

298
00:19:29,245 --> 00:19:31,509
Well, l was thinking... lt's silly.

299
00:19:31,914 --> 00:19:35,042
I’ve never been to Paris.
Maybe l should do some sightseeing.

300
00:19:35,284 --> 00:19:37,184
Sightseeing in Paris?

301
00:19:37,353 --> 00:19:39,344
What a bizarre notion.

302
00:19:40,289 --> 00:19:41,779
What do you got here?

303
00:19:41,924 --> 00:19:44,916
- What do we got here?
- Yeah. You got anything?

304
00:19:45,428 --> 00:19:46,861
We got some stuff.

305
00:19:47,029 --> 00:19:48,860
Like what kind of stuff?

306
00:19:49,198 --> 00:19:51,325
You want to see the Eiffel Tower?

307
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,090
That's here?

308
00:19:56,305 --> 00:19:57,294
See?

309
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,101
You got any other stuff?

310
00:20:08,184 --> 00:20:12,621
<i>He keeps delaying his flight,
buying outfits... He doesn't want to leave.</i>

311
00:20:13,689 --> 00:20:14,883
l find it...

312
00:20:15,057 --> 00:20:17,821
...a lot like New York, but totally different.

313
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,168
<i>Did you always want to be a referee?</i>

314
00:20:26,235 --> 00:20:28,135
<i>No, I started as a player.</i>

315
00:20:28,637 --> 00:20:30,434
<i>- What are you looking at?
- I just--</i>

316
00:20:30,506 --> 00:20:32,497
<i>That I'm vertically challenged?</i>

317
00:20:33,642 --> 00:20:37,976
<i>The best place for me to ref a game is
Madison Square Garden in New York.</i>

318
00:20:38,147 --> 00:20:41,583
<i>Wasn't it a soccer game
where the referee got killed?</i>

319
00:20:41,751 --> 00:20:45,152
<i>- I'm against that.
- Good for you. Take a stand.</i>

320
00:20:45,354 --> 00:20:47,288
<i>You ever get back to the New World?</i>

321
00:20:47,356 --> 00:20:49,847
<i>Every year I visit my father in Wichita.</i>

322
00:20:49,992 --> 00:20:53,587
<i>Wichita? I'll bet his name's Red
and he caps oil-well fires?</i>

323
00:20:53,763 --> 00:20:56,357
<i>No, it's Arthur. And he owned a pet store.</i>

324
00:20:56,499 --> 00:20:57,932
<i>That was my next guess.</i>

325
00:20:58,501 --> 00:21:01,664
<i>- Do you dream in French or English?
- French.</i>

326
00:21:01,871 --> 00:21:03,270
<i>With English subtitles.</i>

327
00:21:03,439 --> 00:21:05,498
<i>I'm impressed. You got little kids...</i>

328
00:21:05,674 --> 00:21:08,643
<i>...2, 3 years old
and they already speak French.</i>

329
00:21:09,779 --> 00:21:13,044
<i>- Rodin never said what he was thinking.
- He's thinking:</i>

330
00:21:13,115 --> 00:21:16,380
<i>''Goddamn, Rodin, three drinks
and I'm nude!''</i>

331
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:23,190
<i>What can you say?</i>

332
00:21:23,392 --> 00:21:24,689
<i>It was Paris.</i>

333
00:21:31,133 --> 00:21:32,691
You got great stuff.

334
00:21:45,648 --> 00:21:47,309
Got it!

335
00:21:48,651 --> 00:21:50,312
Do you know where we are?

336
00:21:50,486 --> 00:21:52,920
On the Seine. That's the Pont Neuf.

337
00:21:53,556 --> 00:21:56,150
This bridge is in a movie.
Don't you recognize it?

338
00:21:56,492 --> 00:21:58,016
Give me a hint.

339
00:21:59,061 --> 00:22:01,222
''lt's very clear''

340
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:02,522
Patton.

341
00:22:05,167 --> 00:22:06,566
Patton?

342
00:22:07,503 --> 00:22:11,064
''lt's very clear our love is here to stay''

343
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,504
<i>- An American In Paris?
- Gene Kelly.</i>

344
00:22:13,676 --> 00:22:16,611
Leslie Caron. This is it.
This is very exciting for me.

345
00:22:17,313 --> 00:22:18,712
Come on, sing the rest.

346
00:22:18,948 --> 00:22:21,576
Sing? No, l can't. No.

347
00:22:21,851 --> 00:22:24,945
With my voice the cops will come
with those sirens.

348
00:22:26,722 --> 00:22:28,713
They'll put me in singing jail.

349
00:22:36,198 --> 00:22:37,597
''lt's...

350
00:22:38,567 --> 00:22:41,559
''...very clear...

351
00:22:42,738 --> 00:22:46,299
''...our love is here to stay

352
00:22:48,143 --> 00:22:50,543
''Not for a year...

353
00:22:51,714 --> 00:22:54,274
''...but forever and a day''

354
00:23:03,792 --> 00:23:06,192
Now you'll tell me you're leaving.

355
00:23:09,231 --> 00:23:12,132
The season starts Monday,
and l must get back.

356
00:23:17,139 --> 00:23:20,131
Do you want the afternoon
or the evening flight?

357
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:23,640
The evening, so we can spend
the day together.

358
00:23:23,812 --> 00:23:25,143
l have to work.

359
00:23:25,314 --> 00:23:27,748
- l'll watch you.
- What?

360
00:23:31,253 --> 00:23:33,312
- This is my place.
- Oh, yeah?

361
00:23:33,656 --> 00:23:34,816
lt's great.

362
00:23:35,024 --> 00:23:38,824
- l had a great time, thanks.
- l had a wonderful time.

363
00:23:39,762 --> 00:23:41,093
So, good night.

364
00:23:41,263 --> 00:23:42,161
Good night.

365
00:23:44,099 --> 00:23:46,329
Would you like to come upstairs?

366
00:23:48,604 --> 00:23:49,571
Really?

367
00:23:50,439 --> 00:23:51,531
Yes.

368
00:23:54,944 --> 00:23:59,847
No. I’m sorry, but to tell you the truth,
l don't find you very attractive.

369
00:24:01,951 --> 00:24:04,545
You've got a big, fat, dumpy ass.

370
00:24:04,853 --> 00:24:07,117
What? He said that?

371
00:24:07,356 --> 00:24:10,416
No, l just said it to see
if you were paying attention.

372
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:11,787
What he said was:

373
00:24:12,361 --> 00:24:14,192
l would love to.

374
00:24:15,064 --> 00:24:16,088
Come on.

375
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:22,733
<i>- And they...
- Yeah.</i>

376
00:24:23,205 --> 00:24:25,696
<i>- And it was...
- Oh, yeah.</i>

377
00:24:25,975 --> 00:24:29,968
<i>You know, it was the first time
Mickey never told me anything...</i>

378
00:24:30,145 --> 00:24:33,137
<i>...which meant it was
really something special.</i>

379
00:25:12,454 --> 00:25:14,718
<i>And finally Mickey has to leave.</i>

380
00:25:15,257 --> 00:25:18,021
<i>He left? He actually left?</i>

381
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:21,022
<i>He had to! The season was starting.</i>

382
00:25:24,533 --> 00:25:25,761
<i>Poor Mickey.</i>

383
00:25:25,934 --> 00:25:29,028
<i>He hadn't had a lot
of beautiful moments in his life.</i>

384
00:25:29,204 --> 00:25:32,139
<i>Even the family dog committed suicide.
He left a note:</i>

385
00:25:32,274 --> 00:25:34,538
<i>''I can't take it anymore, Chi Chi.''</i>

386
00:25:35,644 --> 00:25:39,205
<i>Mickey just never knew that anyone
could be so wonderful.</i>

387
00:25:42,718 --> 00:25:43,980
<i>But he tells himself:</i>

388
00:25:44,053 --> 00:25:47,955
<i>''Forget Paris.
It was just a beautiful few days. Let it go.</i>

389
00:25:48,157 --> 00:25:51,593
<i>''Just let it be a perfect little memory.''</i>

390
00:25:52,394 --> 00:25:53,793
<i>But it's tough.</i>

391
00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:02,628
See this?

392
00:26:03,038 --> 00:26:06,007
They brought Abraham Lincoln
back to life for a few seconds.

393
00:26:06,075 --> 00:26:07,064
When?

394
00:26:08,911 --> 00:26:11,311
Last week they dug him up.

395
00:26:11,747 --> 00:26:16,241
- They gave him this drug, Revivatol.
- No kidding?

396
00:26:16,585 --> 00:26:18,177
lt says he said a few words.

397
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,584
What'd he say? ''How'd the play end?''

398
00:26:22,558 --> 00:26:24,992
How'll you ref with that in your stomach?

399
00:26:25,327 --> 00:26:28,228
You may look like my mother,
but you're not.

400
00:26:30,199 --> 00:26:32,463
- What'll we see today?
- What's playing?

401
00:26:33,202 --> 00:26:36,433
Must we go to the movies?
That's all we ever do.

402
00:26:36,605 --> 00:26:37,936
What do you want to do?

403
00:26:38,707 --> 00:26:41,835
l don't know. l was thinking
maybe we'd go to a...

404
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:43,102
...museum.

405
00:26:46,348 --> 00:26:48,009
And see what?

406
00:26:50,018 --> 00:26:51,212
Art.

407
00:26:53,622 --> 00:26:54,714
Art.

408
00:26:55,624 --> 00:26:59,116
Tommy, would you like to go
to a museum and see art?

409
00:26:59,361 --> 00:27:00,794
Not today, thank you.

410
00:27:00,963 --> 00:27:04,455
We're in Indianapolis
and you want to see art?

411
00:27:04,633 --> 00:27:07,124
When l was in Paris l saw art, okay?

412
00:27:07,302 --> 00:27:11,238
- l saw the Mona Lisa, l saw stuff.
- With that girl you met?

413
00:27:11,373 --> 00:27:12,305
Ellen.

414
00:27:12,641 --> 00:27:16,634
Let me ask you: Why is she in Paris?
ls she too good to live here?

415
00:27:16,812 --> 00:27:18,404
- Good point.
- What do you mean?

416
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:22,746
No point. Why don't you shoot
some of that Revivatol into your brains?

417
00:27:22,985 --> 00:27:24,418
l'll go to the museum...

418
00:27:24,486 --> 00:27:26,249
...to see art.

419
00:27:26,388 --> 00:27:28,549
Leave now to avoid the crowds.

420
00:27:28,757 --> 00:27:30,748
Give my regards to Picasso.

421
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,457
Play or call!

422
00:27:35,497 --> 00:27:37,692
Stop looking at me that way, big baby.

423
00:27:38,767 --> 00:27:41,361
Just play the game, okay? How are you?

424
00:27:47,776 --> 00:27:50,836
Walking, walking, right there, right there.

425
00:27:53,115 --> 00:27:54,878
They're all up and down my back.

426
00:27:55,017 --> 00:27:56,712
You're making $5,000,000 a year.

427
00:27:56,785 --> 00:27:59,845
You could be in a submarine bumping
into a periscope. Play ball!

428
00:27:59,922 --> 00:28:02,356
- You got to call that.
- Stop the whining, okay?

429
00:28:02,524 --> 00:28:05,015
One five and a block. Good.

430
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,851
- Are you new in town?
- Make some calls, Mickey.

431
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:11,022
l'll make them.
I’m getting glare off your head.

432
00:28:12,868 --> 00:28:15,029
No! On the line. On the line.

433
00:28:19,808 --> 00:28:21,207
What, are you tired?

434
00:28:21,877 --> 00:28:25,870
Your girlfriend wore me out last night.
Don't have any legs.

435
00:28:42,331 --> 00:28:43,730
How are you?

436
00:28:46,068 --> 00:28:48,468
lt was a tango. You did the tango.

437
00:28:48,537 --> 00:28:51,131
- Bad call. l was there.
- You weren't.

438
00:28:51,406 --> 00:28:52,338
l was.

439
00:28:52,474 --> 00:28:54,908
- Mick, where'd you buy your clothes?
- Why?

440
00:28:55,077 --> 00:28:57,841
We need to know
where to shop for the kid.

441
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:59,140
Very funny.

442
00:28:59,348 --> 00:29:02,283
Tell Spike that one. Come on, play ball.

443
00:29:04,586 --> 00:29:05,917
Technical foul.

444
00:29:06,088 --> 00:29:08,579
Foul line. Go to the foul line.

445
00:29:08,857 --> 00:29:10,757
- Quiet!
- Give him a tech.

446
00:29:10,926 --> 00:29:13,360
- Why are you here?
- lt wasn't his play.

447
00:29:14,062 --> 00:29:15,495
Thanks, Spud.

448
00:29:15,664 --> 00:29:16,995
You know something?

449
00:29:17,599 --> 00:29:19,430
You're the only one l can talk to.

450
00:29:19,735 --> 00:29:20,997
Open it up, ready?

451
00:29:21,103 --> 00:29:22,365
<i>What about Ellen?</i>

452
00:29:22,504 --> 00:29:24,438
<i>Do they call each other? Write?</i>

453
00:29:24,606 --> 00:29:26,267
<i>She writes. He calls.</i>

454
00:29:26,441 --> 00:29:28,909
<i>But it's no good. He misses her.</i>

455
00:29:31,113 --> 00:29:34,378
<i>Thanksgiving. Big network game.
Lakers at Detroit.</i>

456
00:29:34,616 --> 00:29:36,846
<i>Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's last season.</i>

457
00:29:37,886 --> 00:29:42,789
<i>They had a celebration in every town
the Lakers played. This time in Detroit.</i>

458
00:29:42,958 --> 00:29:47,190
<i>The biggest rivalry in the league.
They're scalping tickets...</i>

459
00:29:47,396 --> 00:29:51,958
<i>...for $600. Of course, Mickey's crew does
the game because he's the best.</i>

460
00:29:52,134 --> 00:29:57,037
<i>Only it's a holiday, he's thousands of miles
from her, he's miserable.</i>

461
00:29:57,406 --> 00:29:59,704
<i>He's a time bomb.</i>

462
00:30:00,542 --> 00:30:03,033
Wake up and drop dead, you putz!

463
00:30:03,211 --> 00:30:04,644
God, l hate your guts!

464
00:30:04,813 --> 00:30:07,646
Where'd you go to ref school,
Dip Shit Tech?

465
00:30:07,816 --> 00:30:09,647
<i>You pathetic pigs.</i>

466
00:30:09,818 --> 00:30:11,718
That's a foul.

467
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:14,718
<i>What's the matter,
the Prozac didn't kick in?</i>

468
00:30:14,923 --> 00:30:18,723
Get in the game, you prick.

469
00:30:21,496 --> 00:30:23,487
<i>What a waste of blood.</i>

470
00:30:24,499 --> 00:30:26,467
You suck!

471
00:30:27,336 --> 00:30:31,329
Mickey, how'd you miss that last call?
You want to borrow these?

472
00:30:39,181 --> 00:30:40,808
Let's go, let's play.

473
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:42,942
Hey, Mickey.

474
00:30:43,085 --> 00:30:46,350
Laimbeer's got me in a headlock.
You waiting for blood?

475
00:30:46,521 --> 00:30:48,682
- Technical foul. Who's shooting?
- For what?

476
00:30:48,757 --> 00:30:50,452
Do you want another one?

477
00:30:50,692 --> 00:30:51,716
What did l say?

478
00:30:51,793 --> 00:30:54,887
Just because you're having a bad game,
don't take it out on me.

479
00:30:54,963 --> 00:30:55,861
You're out!

480
00:30:56,365 --> 00:30:58,356
Are you nuts? lt's my farewell game.

481
00:30:58,533 --> 00:31:01,024
Let me be the first to say farewell.

482
00:31:01,203 --> 00:31:02,693
- Get out of here!
- No.

483
00:31:02,871 --> 00:31:04,202
- You're nuts.
- Really?

484
00:31:04,373 --> 00:31:06,238
- What are you laughing at?
- Nothing.

485
00:31:06,708 --> 00:31:08,369
Technical. For lying.

486
00:31:08,543 --> 00:31:09,976
You out of your mind?

487
00:31:10,112 --> 00:31:11,807
Am l crazy?

488
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,040
You're out, too.

489
00:31:13,215 --> 00:31:15,046
You're throwing me out?

490
00:31:15,217 --> 00:31:16,775
Get out. Take a walk.

491
00:31:17,652 --> 00:31:20,644
You don't run this league!
Nobody ever paid to see you ref.

492
00:31:20,722 --> 00:31:24,055
Nobody paid to see you do anything.
Get out of here.

493
00:31:24,226 --> 00:31:26,387
This is not over. l'll see you again.

494
00:31:26,561 --> 00:31:28,392
Good, l'll still have this.

495
00:31:28,563 --> 00:31:30,394
Big deal. Who cares?

496
00:31:32,801 --> 00:31:34,928
<i>It was horrible. He snapped.</i>

497
00:31:35,637 --> 00:31:39,437
<i>He threw out both teams, the coach,
the trainer, Kareem's parents...</i>

498
00:31:39,508 --> 00:31:40,975
<i>...and the nachos guy.</i>

499
00:31:41,042 --> 00:31:43,704
<i>They had to take Mickey out
in an armoured van.</i>

500
00:31:47,315 --> 00:31:50,011
<i>He committed the cardinal sin
of refereeing.</i>

501
00:31:50,152 --> 00:31:52,518
<i>He brought his personal life onto the court.</i>

502
00:31:52,654 --> 00:31:54,019
<i>I can't believe it!</i>

503
00:31:54,156 --> 00:31:56,522
<i>The league suspended him for a week.</i>

504
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:00,751
<i>He was in bad shape.</i>

505
00:32:02,264 --> 00:32:04,095
<i>So, what did he do?</i>

506
00:32:09,971 --> 00:32:11,632
What are you doing here?

507
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:14,932
What's with this airline?
Now they lost my mother.

508
00:32:16,578 --> 00:32:17,943
Get over here.

509
00:32:25,153 --> 00:32:28,589
- l have five brothers. All older.
- The little princess.

510
00:32:30,091 --> 00:32:34,653
They were all high-school wrestling
champions. They had the wrestling ears.

511
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:37,594
''No potatoes, Mom, l must make weight.''

512
00:32:39,468 --> 00:32:44,098
After the match, it'd be, ''l don't know,
he pinned me. How did he pin me?''

513
00:32:44,272 --> 00:32:47,867
So it was necessary for me
to live in a different world.

514
00:32:48,109 --> 00:32:50,168
But why France? Why here?

515
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:55,380
<i>Do you know the Madeleine books
about the little French girl?</i>

516
00:32:56,051 --> 00:32:59,043
My mother bought me
the whole set when l was young.

517
00:32:59,421 --> 00:33:00,683
And...

518
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:03,783
...l think l was Madeleine.

519
00:33:03,992 --> 00:33:06,290
She made me the hat just like her.

520
00:33:06,461 --> 00:33:10,363
I’d walk around Wichita talking
with a little French accent.

521
00:33:10,532 --> 00:33:13,524
Everybody thought l was crazy,
but here l am.

522
00:33:13,802 --> 00:33:15,394
Your folks still around?

523
00:33:15,804 --> 00:33:17,203
My dad is...

524
00:33:17,372 --> 00:33:20,136
...but Mom died when l was in high school.

525
00:33:21,643 --> 00:33:23,975
l wish she could have seen me here.

526
00:33:30,051 --> 00:33:31,109
What?

527
00:33:33,288 --> 00:33:35,222
lt's just your face...

528
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:39,053
...when you were telling the story.
You looked so beautiful.

529
00:33:39,227 --> 00:33:40,489
Stop.

530
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:03,578
Hey, Ellen.

531
00:34:04,085 --> 00:34:05,382
Let's sit down, okay?

532
00:34:05,487 --> 00:34:06,647
All right.

533
00:34:13,194 --> 00:34:16,857
l don't know if this is
just the right time for me...

534
00:34:17,098 --> 00:34:18,429
...or how we met...

535
00:34:19,367 --> 00:34:22,359
...or just how wonderful you are, but...

536
00:34:24,372 --> 00:34:26,033
...l really love you.

537
00:34:26,708 --> 00:34:28,369
l want us to get married.

538
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:34,110
Oh, Mickey, l am married.

539
00:34:34,616 --> 00:34:36,811
<i>Wait. Is this to see
if I'm paying attention?</i>

540
00:34:36,885 --> 00:34:38,716
<i>No. This part was real.</i>

541
00:34:39,054 --> 00:34:40,282
What?

542
00:34:44,125 --> 00:34:45,285
When?

543
00:34:46,227 --> 00:34:47,626
ln the last few months?

544
00:34:48,897 --> 00:34:50,228
Two years.

545
00:34:53,234 --> 00:34:54,428
Where is he?

546
00:34:54,903 --> 00:34:58,634
Well, we're separated.
We might get back together, but...

547
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:01,438
But you're here with me.

548
00:35:02,644 --> 00:35:04,134
I’m confused.

549
00:35:04,312 --> 00:35:05,802
You're confused?

550
00:35:06,414 --> 00:35:09,645
All this time you never said anything.
You never implied.

551
00:35:09,818 --> 00:35:13,481
I’m not like you.
l can't tell everyone my whole life.

552
00:35:14,022 --> 00:35:17,014
Hit an occasional highlight,
like, ''I’m married.''

553
00:35:21,496 --> 00:35:24,590
You don't do this to a person. You know?

554
00:35:24,766 --> 00:35:27,701
You don't be fabulous
when you know you're not available.

555
00:35:27,769 --> 00:35:29,168
How do you think l feel?

556
00:35:29,237 --> 00:35:30,795
l don't have a clue.

557
00:35:31,539 --> 00:35:33,871
Let's re-cap.
Here's what we know about you.

558
00:35:34,009 --> 00:35:36,876
You're from Wichita,
you have five brothers with bad ears...

559
00:35:37,245 --> 00:35:38,906
...you're great in bed...

560
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:42,013
...and you're married.
I’m overflowing with facts.

561
00:35:42,183 --> 00:35:46,449
l have a good idea.
Why don't you sit down and shut up?

562
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:50,453
I’m in trouble here.

563
00:35:50,792 --> 00:35:53,556
Should l salvage a bad marriage?

564
00:35:53,628 --> 00:35:55,687
I’ve fallen in love with someone else.

565
00:35:56,031 --> 00:35:57,555
l think that my problems...

566
00:35:57,632 --> 00:36:01,625
...are bigger than yours.
Let's have a holiday from sarcasm, okay?

567
00:36:07,575 --> 00:36:09,008
You love me?

568
00:36:18,219 --> 00:36:19,652
ls he French?

569
00:36:20,321 --> 00:36:21,549
Yes.

570
00:36:22,657 --> 00:36:24,147
ls he handsome?

571
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:26,220
Yes.

572
00:36:27,495 --> 00:36:28,826
ls he rich?

573
00:36:30,065 --> 00:36:31,396
Yes.

574
00:36:33,068 --> 00:36:34,831
Does he have a sister?

575
00:36:38,506 --> 00:36:40,736
lf you got him, why do you need me?

576
00:36:40,809 --> 00:36:42,572
He doesn't make me laugh.

577
00:36:42,777 --> 00:36:44,267
- No?
- No.

578
00:36:44,846 --> 00:36:46,404
He makes me miserable.

579
00:36:46,514 --> 00:36:49,608
l can do that. Give me a chance, please?

580
00:36:50,919 --> 00:36:52,682
l can't, Mickey.

581
00:36:54,889 --> 00:36:56,618
Where are you going?

582
00:37:02,864 --> 00:37:04,855
<i>So, what happened?</i>

583
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:06,590
<i>He came home again.</i>

584
00:37:06,768 --> 00:37:08,531
<i>- Alone?
- Alone.</i>

585
00:37:08,703 --> 00:37:11,263
<i>This time he's determined not
to eat his heart out.</i>

586
00:37:11,439 --> 00:37:14,101
<i>If she's not available, she's not available.</i>

587
00:37:14,275 --> 00:37:17,267
<i>He'll go back to seeing the women
he was seeing before.</i>

588
00:37:17,445 --> 00:37:18,776
<i>Who was he seeing?</i>

589
00:37:19,214 --> 00:37:23,548
<i>Mickey was seeing a wide variety
of interesting women.</i>

590
00:37:27,956 --> 00:37:29,787
Am l going to see you tonight?

591
00:37:30,291 --> 00:37:31,315
You call me.

592
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:32,849
Tonight.

593
00:37:35,797 --> 00:37:37,287
<i>It was a rich, full life.</i>

594
00:37:37,465 --> 00:37:39,899
<i>Then, one night in Charlotte,
North Carolina...</i>

595
00:37:43,538 --> 00:37:45,301
<i>It's an off night, so he's alone.</i>

596
00:37:45,373 --> 00:37:48,342
<i>Just him and the guy coughing
in the next room.</i>

597
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:54,312
Attack of the Phlegm Creature.

598
00:37:55,083 --> 00:37:57,574
Ever think about going to a hospital?

599
00:38:01,222 --> 00:38:04,282
Come on, cough it up. Spit it up, already.

600
00:38:07,829 --> 00:38:09,490
<i>Coming up next, more women's...</i>

601
00:38:09,564 --> 00:38:10,656
<i>...bodybuilding.</i>

602
00:38:10,732 --> 00:38:12,222
Too much of a good thing.

603
00:38:20,108 --> 00:38:21,803
<i>He called her?</i>

604
00:38:21,876 --> 00:38:23,468
<i>No, he called me.</i>

605
00:38:23,778 --> 00:38:25,939
<i>I was in bed...reading.</i>

606
00:38:26,114 --> 00:38:28,776
- How are you?
- Mickey, where are you?

607
00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:32,442
l don't know. l have to check my itinerary.

608
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:37,284
I’m either in Denver or Charlotte.
And l got a room next to Doc Holliday.

609
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:44,521
You remember that fourth-grade teacher
who crossed her legs and we went nuts?

610
00:38:44,599 --> 00:38:47,625
She had the garters and hooks.
We didn't know what it was.

611
00:38:48,369 --> 00:38:50,030
Miss Pitter.

612
00:38:51,372 --> 00:38:55,365
You're right. Miss Pitter,
how'd you remember that?

613
00:38:55,476 --> 00:38:56,966
<i>Did you run into her?</i>

614
00:38:57,145 --> 00:39:01,707
No. l was going to masturbate later and
l wanted a name to go with the picture.

615
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:03,810
You all right?

616
00:39:04,552 --> 00:39:05,883
No, l...

617
00:39:07,055 --> 00:39:09,888
I’m really lonely. l don't feel good and...

618
00:39:11,492 --> 00:39:13,824
Could l call you back in a few minutes?

619
00:39:15,063 --> 00:39:19,500
Hold on. l really want to talk to you,
but l got this professional cougher...

620
00:39:19,667 --> 00:39:23,000
...here who wants to fight with me.
Just a second.

621
00:39:23,905 --> 00:39:26,567
Now listen, you've kept me up all night.

622
00:39:30,745 --> 00:39:32,235
What are you doing here?

623
00:39:36,084 --> 00:39:38,575
Do you sleep with the window open?

624
00:39:42,423 --> 00:39:43,412
Yeah.

625
00:39:43,925 --> 00:39:46,689
l don't like it. You'll have to stop that.

626
00:39:47,095 --> 00:39:48,255
Okay.

627
00:39:50,932 --> 00:39:53,730
Do you squeeze the toothpaste
from the top or the bottom?

628
00:39:54,769 --> 00:39:55,667
Top.

629
00:39:55,737 --> 00:39:57,932
Don't do that. l hate that.

630
00:39:59,374 --> 00:40:04,277
lf you use my car, you better put
the mirror and the seat back where l like it.

631
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:08,908
Don't use my razor
to shave any part of you.

632
00:40:09,951 --> 00:40:13,887
lf you lose your hair, don't grow
that thing down from your sideburn...

633
00:40:14,055 --> 00:40:17,513
...and wrap it around your head.
lt's disgusting and l don't like that.

634
00:40:17,725 --> 00:40:21,559
Don't hand me food and say,
''Taste this, see if it's bad.''

635
00:40:22,563 --> 00:40:24,121
- All right.
- Okay?

636
00:40:26,467 --> 00:40:30,062
You want to talk religion, politics,
or if you want kids?

637
00:40:30,238 --> 00:40:33,674
That'll work itself out.
We've handled the big issues.

638
00:40:34,575 --> 00:40:35,633
All right.

639
00:40:35,810 --> 00:40:37,072
l'll marry you.

640
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:40,072
l love you.

641
00:40:40,248 --> 00:40:41,306
l love you.

642
00:40:52,593 --> 00:40:53,821
<i>And that was it.</i>

643
00:40:54,262 --> 00:40:57,857
<i>- And you listened the whole time?
- Yeah. It was beautiful.</i>

644
00:40:58,266 --> 00:41:02,259
Oh, honey, that was nice.
That was a really nice story.

645
00:41:03,037 --> 00:41:05,505
lt's so romantic,
and then when she comes back...

646
00:41:06,774 --> 00:41:07,832
What's wrong?

647
00:41:08,009 --> 00:41:09,271
What happened?

648
00:41:09,444 --> 00:41:10,342
Nothing.

649
00:41:10,611 --> 00:41:13,171
Why do all your women end up crying?

650
00:41:13,348 --> 00:41:15,339
They don't. Will you shut...

651
00:41:18,286 --> 00:41:21,346
Andy was telling me
this really wonderful story.

652
00:41:21,522 --> 00:41:22,682
Oh, was he?

653
00:41:23,191 --> 00:41:25,125
Hi, Craig. How are you, Lucy?

654
00:41:25,293 --> 00:41:26,521
I’m hot.

655
00:41:26,694 --> 00:41:28,628
Welcome to Helen's. What'll it be?

656
00:41:28,696 --> 00:41:30,357
You got a nice white wine?

657
00:41:30,531 --> 00:41:34,194
Sure. lt's like me:
bold, but with a hint of whimsy.

658
00:41:34,369 --> 00:41:35,358
Fine.

659
00:41:35,536 --> 00:41:38,198
- And for the lady?
- Perrier with lime, no ice.

660
00:41:38,373 --> 00:41:39,863
Excellent choice.

661
00:41:40,475 --> 00:41:41,464
What story?

662
00:41:41,542 --> 00:41:43,874
- The Ellen-Mickey story.
- Which one?

663
00:41:44,045 --> 00:41:48,379
The one. How they met. The dead father.
Her showing up in North Carolina.

664
00:41:48,549 --> 00:41:50,483
l just can't wait to meet them.

665
00:41:50,651 --> 00:41:52,881
Them? They're both coming?

666
00:41:54,155 --> 00:41:55,622
What do you mean?

667
00:41:55,690 --> 00:41:56,850
Nothing.

668
00:41:57,725 --> 00:42:00,216
l was under the impression they were...

669
00:42:02,063 --> 00:42:03,496
What?

670
00:42:03,731 --> 00:42:06,165
After that wonderful story?

671
00:42:06,334 --> 00:42:08,564
What happened? They were so in love.

672
00:42:08,736 --> 00:42:11,330
They were wild for each other.

673
00:42:11,506 --> 00:42:16,068
She got divorced. They got married
right away. Those first months were...

674
00:42:16,244 --> 00:42:18,508
- Are you crazy?
- No.

675
00:42:18,679 --> 00:42:22,513
- You're going to weigh your food here?
- Yes. lt's for Weight Watchers.

676
00:42:22,683 --> 00:42:24,344
l want to look good for their wedding.

677
00:42:24,419 --> 00:42:26,250
How is this bothering you?

678
00:42:27,588 --> 00:42:28,680
l can't...

679
00:42:29,424 --> 00:42:31,517
- You want me to tell her?
- No.

680
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:34,193
As l was saying...

681
00:42:34,529 --> 00:42:38,693
...the first few months were fabulous.
Like a constant honeymoon.

682
00:42:38,866 --> 00:42:40,265
She had no job.

683
00:42:40,435 --> 00:42:44,371
Basketball season was almost over.
She travelled all over with him...

684
00:42:44,539 --> 00:42:46,063
...saw every game.

685
00:42:46,707 --> 00:42:48,038
They had a ball.

686
00:42:48,209 --> 00:42:50,268
Look how much a lime weighs.

687
00:42:52,447 --> 00:42:55,678
<i>Now the season ends
and it's time for the hard part.</i>

688
00:42:55,750 --> 00:42:57,980
<i>The honeymoon's over
and the marriage begins.</i>

689
00:42:58,052 --> 00:43:00,885
<i>He'd moved to LA a couple years
after we did.</i>

690
00:43:01,055 --> 00:43:05,958
<i>They went to his place at the Marina,
it's not exactly her idea of a love nest.</i>

691
00:43:06,461 --> 00:43:07,792
Open them!

692
00:43:11,132 --> 00:43:14,431
<i>It was sort of a shrine to watching ESPN.</i>

693
00:43:14,502 --> 00:43:15,594
Welcome home.

694
00:43:15,770 --> 00:43:18,000
<i>- It’s just a matter of taste.
- Or lack of.</i>

695
00:43:18,406 --> 00:43:23,070
<i>Anyway, then October comes.
It's time for Mickey to go back on the road.</i>

696
00:43:23,144 --> 00:43:26,238
<i>- She's heartbroken.
- He was heartbroken, too.</i>

697
00:43:26,414 --> 00:43:29,645
<i>Yeah, he was.
They were very much in love.</i>

698
00:43:31,419 --> 00:43:32,579
Travel safely.

699
00:43:32,653 --> 00:43:34,314
<i>She'd left her job in France.</i>

700
00:43:34,388 --> 00:43:37,050
<i>She'd lost her tenure.
She had to start over.</i>

701
00:43:37,825 --> 00:43:42,762
<i>All she could get was this crummy job
in customer relations at Burbank Airport.</i>

702
00:43:42,930 --> 00:43:45,592
Look what you've done to my clothes!

703
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:49,192
l see, but l have to deal
with this situation first, so just...

704
00:43:50,171 --> 00:43:55,006
Mrs. Durkin? I’m calling from Burbank
Airport and l have your three children here.

705
00:43:55,176 --> 00:43:58,270
They did not get on the plane
because we didn't let them.

706
00:43:58,446 --> 00:44:01,176
<i>Why not? The oldest one is 7
and they showed up...</i>

707
00:44:01,349 --> 00:44:03,010
...here unsupervised.

708
00:44:03,117 --> 00:44:04,448
- Lady!
- Could you--

709
00:44:04,685 --> 00:44:06,448
This is disgusting.

710
00:44:06,621 --> 00:44:08,452
Could you get off the phone?

711
00:44:08,623 --> 00:44:13,458
l don't care if you want to surprise your
husband and the bitch he ran away with.

712
00:44:14,362 --> 00:44:16,853
Get your crap off my counter now!

713
00:44:20,134 --> 00:44:22,466
<i>She's not happy. Mickey only...</i>

714
00:44:22,537 --> 00:44:24,266
<i>...comes home four days a month.</i>

715
00:44:24,372 --> 00:44:25,862
<i>She's in a strange city...</i>

716
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:27,132
<i>...all alone...</i>

717
00:44:27,208 --> 00:44:31,372
<i>...with a job she hates,
working all hours, weekends, nights.</i>

718
00:44:32,046 --> 00:44:34,708
<i>She was scared. This is LA.</i>

719
00:44:35,883 --> 00:44:37,714
<i>She even got one of those dolls.</i>

720
00:44:37,885 --> 00:44:41,377
<i>- What do you mean ''dolls''?
- It's called Safe-T-Man.</i>

721
00:44:41,556 --> 00:44:46,459
<i>When you're scared you put it next to you.
People think it's a guy.</i>

722
00:44:46,594 --> 00:44:50,360
Those are good. My sister had one.
No one ever bothered her.

723
00:44:50,698 --> 00:44:52,256
Yeah, that was the reason.

724
00:44:54,669 --> 00:44:57,729
Now something happens to Ellen
you won't believe.

725
00:44:57,905 --> 00:45:00,840
This is fabulous. l'll tell it. l tell it better.

726
00:45:01,008 --> 00:45:05,069
I’m already telling it. When l finish
this story, you'll call me a liar.

727
00:45:05,246 --> 00:45:08,340
But it's the God's honest truth.
Tell it good.

728
00:45:08,716 --> 00:45:11,981
<i>- She's sitting at home at night...
- It was day.</i>

729
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:14,445
<i>No, I'm on the first part of the story.</i>

730
00:45:14,522 --> 00:45:16,251
<i>Oh, yeah. Night.</i>

731
00:45:16,591 --> 00:45:18,855
- She's sitting at home at night...
- At night.

732
00:45:19,026 --> 00:45:21,256
...feeling miserable when she has...

733
00:45:21,429 --> 00:45:23,090
<i>...an unexpected visitor.</i>

734
00:45:23,264 --> 00:45:25,095
<i>The first husband from Paris?</i>

735
00:45:25,266 --> 00:45:26,597
<i>Close.</i>

736
00:45:29,704 --> 00:45:32,138
<i>A mouse. So she calls an exterminator.</i>

737
00:45:32,473 --> 00:45:36,375
Glue traps. They're not like the old kind
that snap their heads off.

738
00:45:36,444 --> 00:45:40,437
<i>A simple gluey piece of paper.
Put a little food in the middle.</i>

739
00:45:40,615 --> 00:45:44,381
<i>The mouse comes, looks at the food,
goes for the food.</i>

740
00:45:44,552 --> 00:45:48,352
Gets stuck. So he squirms around
but can't get away.

741
00:45:48,623 --> 00:45:50,147
<i>It's how Lucy and I met.</i>

742
00:45:50,391 --> 00:45:52,291
lt's pretty cool.

743
00:45:52,893 --> 00:45:57,125
<i>Coming home the next day,
she hears a commotion in the living room.</i>

744
00:45:57,298 --> 00:46:00,062
<i>Did she get a mouse in the glue?
Don't tell me.</i>

745
00:46:00,167 --> 00:46:01,828
<i>Let me tell this part.</i>

746
00:46:02,136 --> 00:46:04,627
<i>Then you can tell the rest of it.</i>

747
00:46:05,206 --> 00:46:09,802
<i>She'd left the sliding door open
and a pigeon flew in, went after the food...</i>

748
00:46:10,077 --> 00:46:12,739
<i>...and got stuck in the glue.</i>

749
00:46:13,447 --> 00:46:15,415
<i>- She calls the vet.
- Then the vet says:</i>

750
00:46:15,483 --> 00:46:16,780
<i>''Get it right over!''</i>

751
00:46:16,851 --> 00:46:20,582
<i>He's got chemicals that can dissolve
the glue and save the bird.</i>

752
00:46:20,821 --> 00:46:24,188
<i>- She puts the bird in a box, gets in the car.
- And heads for the vet.</i>

753
00:46:24,258 --> 00:46:26,749
<i>- The bird's very nervous.
- Who wouldn't be?</i>

754
00:46:26,927 --> 00:46:28,417
<i>She takes off.</i>

755
00:46:28,763 --> 00:46:31,823
<i>She's driving along,
she hits a huge pothole.</i>

756
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:34,092
<i>The bird flies into the air...</i>

757
00:46:34,168 --> 00:46:36,932
<i>- ...and sticks to her head.
- You're a liar!</i>

758
00:46:37,104 --> 00:46:38,594
<i>Told you.</i>

759
00:46:39,674 --> 00:46:40,663
Get off.

760
00:46:48,182 --> 00:46:50,116
Help! Help!

761
00:46:51,852 --> 00:46:53,513
Did you see that?

762
00:46:54,021 --> 00:46:56,182
Those are the earrings l wanted.

763
00:47:10,037 --> 00:47:12,801
Mrs. Gordon for Dr. Pilch, please.

764
00:47:13,307 --> 00:47:14,934
Your pet's name?

765
00:47:15,009 --> 00:47:16,977
Get me Dr. Pilch or l'll kill you!

766
00:47:22,683 --> 00:47:24,116
- Honey?
- ln here.

767
00:47:24,452 --> 00:47:26,647
Your lover-man's home.

768
00:47:26,887 --> 00:47:28,320
What a trip l had...

769
00:47:33,260 --> 00:47:34,591
l'll tell her.

770
00:47:35,396 --> 00:47:38,126
Thank you, Doctor. Thanks for calling.
'Bye.

771
00:47:39,133 --> 00:47:42,625
That was the vet. lt's good news.
The pigeon will make it.

772
00:47:45,139 --> 00:47:47,699
Why are you giving me the stink eye?

773
00:47:47,975 --> 00:47:49,909
You had mice in the apartment.

774
00:47:50,044 --> 00:47:52,410
Me? l haven't been here for a month.

775
00:47:52,713 --> 00:47:53,907
l know.

776
00:47:56,917 --> 00:47:59,579
Come on, now. l didn't do anything.

777
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:03,315
You just had an ''l had
a bird glued to my head'' day.

778
00:48:03,891 --> 00:48:07,418
You go from normal to Tippi Hedren.
lt'd shake a person up.

779
00:48:08,429 --> 00:48:10,021
When do you go away again?

780
00:48:10,231 --> 00:48:11,789
Day after tomorrow.

781
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:13,831
For how long?

782
00:48:14,068 --> 00:48:15,194
Ten days.

783
00:48:16,070 --> 00:48:18,129
Then I’m home for three. We'll go away.

784
00:48:18,372 --> 00:48:19,270
Great.

785
00:48:20,841 --> 00:48:22,172
Didn't you just...

786
00:48:22,343 --> 00:48:23,537
...finish one?

787
00:48:23,677 --> 00:48:25,872
I’ve gained eight pounds. Okay?

788
00:48:26,013 --> 00:48:28,106
Okay, sure. Fine with me.

789
00:48:28,949 --> 00:48:33,511
ln fact, l think l'll gain 20 more.
Then maybe l'll just be perfect.

790
00:48:33,687 --> 00:48:34,779
How is that?

791
00:48:34,889 --> 00:48:37,551
For me? A dream come true. l can't wait.

792
00:48:37,892 --> 00:48:40,827
Let's go and have a stack
of buttermilk pancakes.

793
00:48:42,062 --> 00:48:43,324
Let's get you big!

794
00:48:43,397 --> 00:48:47,390
Bring your new friends Ben and Jerry.
We'll turn your ass into a helipad.

795
00:48:47,468 --> 00:48:48,696
Come on.

796
00:48:54,775 --> 00:48:56,072
l look terrible.

797
00:48:56,277 --> 00:48:57,539
- No.
- l do.

798
00:48:57,711 --> 00:48:59,770
- You don't.
- l do.

799
00:49:00,915 --> 00:49:02,405
I’m lonely.

800
00:49:04,118 --> 00:49:05,517
l hate my job.

801
00:49:06,053 --> 00:49:10,752
l hate this apartment. l didn't come
all the way from France to be alone.

802
00:49:12,193 --> 00:49:13,125
Lately...

803
00:49:14,061 --> 00:49:17,053
...I’ve been having certain feelings...

804
00:49:17,298 --> 00:49:18,492
...about...

805
00:49:19,133 --> 00:49:20,794
...Safe-T-Man.

806
00:49:25,072 --> 00:49:27,905
Ellen, l love you. l love you so much.

807
00:49:28,075 --> 00:49:32,739
l wish l could do something, but it's
not like l can quit my job or anything.

808
00:49:32,913 --> 00:49:33,937
Why not?

809
00:49:35,583 --> 00:49:36,572
What?

810
00:49:37,351 --> 00:49:39,546
Why can't you quit your job?

811
00:49:40,087 --> 00:49:44,148
Right, that's... That's impossible.
l mean, it's ridiculous.

812
00:49:44,325 --> 00:49:45,724
lt's ridiculous?

813
00:49:46,527 --> 00:49:47,926
l quit my job.

814
00:49:48,095 --> 00:49:50,723
Remember? l gave up everything for you.

815
00:49:56,337 --> 00:49:58,464
Come out on the road again with me.

816
00:49:58,639 --> 00:50:00,470
- We had a great time.
- Great?

817
00:50:00,941 --> 00:50:03,034
Every other day on a different plane?

818
00:50:03,177 --> 00:50:07,944
Room service in the hotel at 1:00 a.m.
while you ice down your knees?

819
00:50:08,115 --> 00:50:09,639
Who wants that life?

820
00:50:11,018 --> 00:50:12,315
l do.

821
00:50:12,953 --> 00:50:14,682
l like my job.

822
00:50:14,955 --> 00:50:17,583
Can't you do it for a local high school?

823
00:50:17,725 --> 00:50:19,784
Those high-school kids are armed.

824
00:50:19,994 --> 00:50:22,155
They pay nothing. Honey, I’m a pro.

825
00:50:22,396 --> 00:50:26,059
I’m one of the best in the league
and it's what I’ve done for ten years.

826
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:28,062
All right.

827
00:50:28,369 --> 00:50:29,802
I’m sorry.

828
00:50:30,070 --> 00:50:33,062
l know that your job means a lot to you.

829
00:50:33,807 --> 00:50:36,139
l just can't do this anymore.

830
00:50:45,986 --> 00:50:50,787
<i>So he calls me. I once offered him
a job selling cars for his off-season.</i>

831
00:50:50,858 --> 00:50:53,418
<i>He had the personality to do it.</i>

832
00:50:53,827 --> 00:50:54,953
<i>So, he quit?</i>

833
00:50:55,029 --> 00:50:58,692
<i>He asked the league for a year off.
A leave of absence.</i>

834
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:02,330
<i>He and Ellen are together again.
She talks him...</i>

835
00:51:02,436 --> 00:51:05,633
<i>- ...into buying a little house.
- It was charming.</i>

836
00:51:05,706 --> 00:51:08,470
<i>If ''charming'' means hot and overpriced.</i>

837
00:51:08,642 --> 00:51:11,634
<i>Anyway, she's working out.
She looks fabulous.</i>

838
00:51:11,879 --> 00:51:14,211
<i>Yeah, everything's great...for her.</i>

839
00:51:14,415 --> 00:51:17,077
<i>The knuckleheads at the airlines
finally realize...</i>

840
00:51:17,318 --> 00:51:20,151
<i>...she's 90 times too qualified for her job.</i>

841
00:51:20,521 --> 00:51:24,514
<i>They move her into an office downtown.
She's the head of a department.</i>

842
00:51:24,692 --> 00:51:26,853
<i>She's the happiest she's ever been.</i>

843
00:51:27,027 --> 00:51:28,688
<i>Good! And how's Mickey?</i>

844
00:51:28,862 --> 00:51:31,990
<i>Mickey is not wonderful.</i>

845
00:51:33,634 --> 00:51:35,534
What mileage does it get?

846
00:51:35,703 --> 00:51:38,194
Fabulous. Fabulous mileage.

847
00:51:38,372 --> 00:51:41,136
<i>lt gets 100 in the city
and 3,000 on the highway.</i>

848
00:51:41,275 --> 00:51:43,539
<i>- What?
- Car and Driver called the...</i>

849
00:51:44,645 --> 00:51:46,044
- What are we in?
- Subaru.

850
00:51:46,213 --> 00:51:48,272
Said it was great. Unquote.

851
00:51:49,049 --> 00:51:51,142
You actually knew Michael Jordan?

852
00:51:51,285 --> 00:51:53,651
I’m the one who shaved his head.

853
00:51:55,155 --> 00:51:56,645
<i>So, she's happy...</i>

854
00:51:56,790 --> 00:51:59,224
<i>...he's miserable. And his mind says:</i>

855
00:51:59,293 --> 00:52:02,262
<i>''What the hell is making her so happy?''</i>

856
00:52:03,397 --> 00:52:04,295
Ellen!

857
00:52:05,265 --> 00:52:06,357
Follow that car.

858
00:52:06,433 --> 00:52:09,231
- What?
- The Porsche. Come on, catch up to it.

859
00:52:09,303 --> 00:52:11,498
Come on. Gun this rickshaw!

860
00:52:11,805 --> 00:52:13,739
Move it, that's my wife!

861
00:52:20,581 --> 00:52:21,912
lt's not her.

862
00:52:24,084 --> 00:52:25,312
lt's not her.

863
00:52:25,486 --> 00:52:26,544
lt's not her.

864
00:52:37,331 --> 00:52:38,764
So, you like it?

865
00:52:39,299 --> 00:52:43,292
<i>It wasn't that he couldn't sell cars.
Most days he wasn't bad.</i>

866
00:52:43,437 --> 00:52:44,802
<i>His heart wasn't in it.</i>

867
00:52:45,606 --> 00:52:48,097
<i>The worst was during the playoffs.</i>

868
00:52:49,443 --> 00:52:50,705
<i>Poor Mickey.</i>

869
00:52:50,944 --> 00:52:52,343
<i>That was a rough time.</i>

870
00:52:52,513 --> 00:52:54,504
<i>He made it rough.</i>

871
00:52:54,715 --> 00:52:58,708
Craig gave him a good job.
My brother Richard was dying for that job.

872
00:52:58,852 --> 00:53:00,149
Again with this?

873
00:53:00,854 --> 00:53:02,719
Unlike Mickey...

874
00:53:02,890 --> 00:53:05,017
...Richard would've appreciated that job.

875
00:53:05,225 --> 00:53:07,591
Richard needs instructions to put on a hat.

876
00:53:08,862 --> 00:53:13,299
He fell down some steps when he was
a baby. Can we get back to the point?

877
00:53:13,467 --> 00:53:17,028
You're giving her the wrong idea.
You're making Ellen the villain.

878
00:53:17,237 --> 00:53:18,966
There's two sides to everything.

879
00:53:19,039 --> 00:53:20,199
You tell it.

880
00:53:20,474 --> 00:53:21,941
Ellen would talk to me...

881
00:53:22,009 --> 00:53:23,340
<i>...during that period.</i>

882
00:53:23,544 --> 00:53:25,478
- Veal parmigiana.
- What?

883
00:53:25,646 --> 00:53:28,877
That's the only thing
he'll eat at a restaurant.

884
00:53:29,049 --> 00:53:30,983
We've been out with him, l know.

885
00:53:31,151 --> 00:53:34,780
There's so many things he'll only do.
He'll only go to the movies.

886
00:53:34,888 --> 00:53:37,880
''What'll we do tonight?''
''Let's go to a movie.''

887
00:53:38,092 --> 00:53:39,320
He's used to that.

888
00:53:39,426 --> 00:53:42,862
ln Paris, he went to the museum
and to the ballet.

889
00:53:43,163 --> 00:53:47,395
Forget Paris. He was courting.
They'll do anything when they're courting.

890
00:53:47,568 --> 00:53:49,559
Craig knitted me a sweater.

891
00:53:50,003 --> 00:53:52,904
<i>We went to the theatre
to see Phantom of the Opera.</i>

892
00:53:53,073 --> 00:53:55,769
- Oh, that's so beautiful.
- Yeah.

893
00:53:55,909 --> 00:53:57,399
You know what Mickey said?

894
00:53:57,578 --> 00:54:00,911
- You liked it?
- l loved it. lt was romantic.

895
00:54:01,415 --> 00:54:04,282
The guy's got broken dinnerware
on his face...

896
00:54:04,418 --> 00:54:07,353
...under which is a pizza,
and she's in love with him?

897
00:54:07,521 --> 00:54:09,455
She was in love with his soul.

898
00:54:09,523 --> 00:54:12,185
<i>That's ridiculous.
lt's like Beauty and the Beast.</i>

899
00:54:12,359 --> 00:54:14,350
lt's all stuff they sell to women.

900
00:54:14,528 --> 00:54:17,588
Teddy Stein was the sweetest guy
in my high school.

901
00:54:17,798 --> 00:54:22,167
He had a bit of a droopy eye and a mole
on his cheek. Could not get a date.

902
00:54:22,269 --> 00:54:24,999
But this Phantom with an exploded head...

903
00:54:25,139 --> 00:54:27,733
Women are squirming in their seats.
lt's not real.

904
00:54:27,808 --> 00:54:29,366
l loved it. The music--

905
00:54:29,543 --> 00:54:33,035
<i>You know what the big song was?
lt was School Days.</i>

906
00:54:33,814 --> 00:54:35,213
- What?
- Yeah!

907
00:54:38,385 --> 00:54:40,876
''School days, school days
Dear old...

908
00:54:40,954 --> 00:54:43,582
''...golden rule days''
Do they think we're dopes?

909
00:54:45,559 --> 00:54:47,322
You hated the whole evening?

910
00:54:47,394 --> 00:54:50,158
No, no. The veal parmigiana was good.

911
00:54:50,731 --> 00:54:52,722
<i>It was a hard time for him.</i>

912
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:54,097
<i>He was unhappy...</i>

913
00:54:54,168 --> 00:54:56,102
...so everything irritated him.

914
00:54:56,470 --> 00:54:59,962
l guess. She was irritating him
and he was irritating her.

915
00:55:00,140 --> 00:55:01,903
They irritated each other.

916
00:55:01,975 --> 00:55:04,307
- Things were horrible.
- Then they got worse.

917
00:55:04,578 --> 00:55:06,409
- What do you mean?
- The father.

918
00:55:06,914 --> 00:55:09,747
- l forgot about the father!
- The father's dead.

919
00:55:09,883 --> 00:55:12,545
- They buried him in France.
- No, Ellen's father.

920
00:55:12,753 --> 00:55:14,414
Why didn't you say?

921
00:55:14,588 --> 00:55:17,352
More Perrier, please.
This was a nightmare.

922
00:55:17,491 --> 00:55:19,584
- Why?
- He retired. He was a widower.

923
00:55:19,927 --> 00:55:22,862
And he also had
a few little health problems.

924
00:55:23,130 --> 00:55:25,462
The wrestling brothers didn't want
to take him.

925
00:55:25,532 --> 00:55:28,399
- So he moves in with them.
- Ellen's working days.

926
00:55:28,502 --> 00:55:31,027
Mickey is working a lot of nights.

927
00:55:31,271 --> 00:55:34,672
Mickey's home a lot
with Ellen's dad, Arthur.

928
00:55:35,008 --> 00:55:39,809
Arthur is the kind of guy
who could drive you insane.

929
00:55:40,214 --> 00:55:41,203
How?

930
00:55:41,381 --> 00:55:43,372
''You asked for it...

931
00:55:43,717 --> 00:55:45,412
''...you got it...

932
00:55:46,386 --> 00:55:48,013
''...Toyota.

933
00:55:51,525 --> 00:55:53,891
''You asked for it...

934
00:55:54,061 --> 00:55:55,551
''...you got it...

935
00:55:56,930 --> 00:55:58,659
''...Toyota.''

936
00:56:52,019 --> 00:56:54,749
''Ed's Tropical Aquarium.''

937
00:56:56,089 --> 00:56:57,317
''Mattress City.''

938
00:56:58,258 --> 00:57:00,852
''Donuts, Donuts, Donuts.''

939
00:57:02,262 --> 00:57:05,026
''Mister Sid's Tuxedos.''

940
00:57:05,766 --> 00:57:07,700
''Six Guys from Greece...

941
00:57:07,901 --> 00:57:10,563
''...Authentic Greek Food.''

942
00:57:15,275 --> 00:57:17,368
Why don't you tell him to stop?

943
00:57:17,544 --> 00:57:20,035
l don't think he knows he's doing it.

944
00:57:20,213 --> 00:57:22,010
So this is your life now?

945
00:57:22,149 --> 00:57:24,140
How did you let this happen to you?

946
00:57:24,484 --> 00:57:25,883
l don't know.

947
00:57:26,119 --> 00:57:29,054
The longest l lived with anybody
before this was...

948
00:57:29,189 --> 00:57:30,622
...eight hours, you know.

949
00:57:30,691 --> 00:57:32,454
That made me feel stifled.

950
00:57:32,726 --> 00:57:34,853
I’m just not used to...

951
00:57:34,995 --> 00:57:37,987
...someone else having an opinion
about my life.

952
00:57:38,231 --> 00:57:40,096
An opinion l have to listen to.

953
00:57:40,167 --> 00:57:41,600
No, you don't.

954
00:57:41,902 --> 00:57:43,494
- l don't?
- No.

955
00:57:44,304 --> 00:57:45,794
So, what are you saying?

956
00:57:45,906 --> 00:57:50,104
A wife is somebody to adore you
and have sex with and not bother you?

957
00:57:50,410 --> 00:57:51,741
Keep going.

958
00:57:52,012 --> 00:57:53,138
What?

959
00:57:53,413 --> 00:57:55,574
Chef of the Future, what's with the meat?

960
00:57:55,649 --> 00:57:57,139
Making progress?

961
00:57:57,751 --> 00:57:59,241
lt's not quite there yet.

962
00:57:59,419 --> 00:58:01,751
You want to give me a time frame?

963
00:58:01,822 --> 00:58:04,154
Maybe early next week, the fall,
Christmas?

964
00:58:04,324 --> 00:58:06,315
So we can plan our vacation.

965
00:58:06,526 --> 00:58:09,017
lt's just this short of greatness.

966
00:58:09,296 --> 00:58:11,161
So are you, Jack.

967
00:58:11,331 --> 00:58:13,595
She got you. lt's a good one.

968
00:58:13,767 --> 00:58:16,258
Go! Make the girl food. The salad.

969
00:58:16,436 --> 00:58:20,236
Oh, Ellen, let's go make the girl food.
The salad.

970
00:58:22,442 --> 00:58:25,775
The same thing happened to me
when l first got married.

971
00:58:25,946 --> 00:58:29,643
''How can you always leave me?
l didn't get married to be alone.''

972
00:58:29,716 --> 00:58:33,618
She said, ''Give it up.
Stay home, get a real job.''

973
00:58:33,854 --> 00:58:38,382
l said, ''You're asking me to give up
what l do, what l am. l can't do it.''

974
00:58:38,458 --> 00:58:39,652
She understood?

975
00:58:39,993 --> 00:58:41,984
We worked out a compromise.

976
00:58:42,195 --> 00:58:44,459
l went back to work and she divorced me.

977
00:58:45,399 --> 00:58:46,366
Lois?

978
00:58:47,067 --> 00:58:49,900
No, this was Beverly, the first Mrs. Jack.

979
00:58:50,804 --> 00:58:52,169
l didn't know about her.

980
00:58:52,239 --> 00:58:54,366
Then l met Lois and she got it.

981
00:58:55,275 --> 00:58:56,367
Got what?

982
00:58:57,778 --> 00:59:02,181
Mickey, l don't like to stick my nose
into anybody's business...

983
00:59:02,315 --> 00:59:03,805
- But...
- But...

984
00:59:04,084 --> 00:59:08,987
lf you're with a woman and she doesn't get
what you are, what's in your guts...

985
00:59:10,657 --> 00:59:11,851
...move on.

986
00:59:12,392 --> 00:59:13,882
Move on?

987
00:59:14,227 --> 00:59:15,956
Move on.

988
00:59:16,830 --> 00:59:18,388
Jack, what are you saying?

989
00:59:20,100 --> 00:59:21,829
I’m saying move on.

990
00:59:27,007 --> 00:59:28,497
You're up.

991
00:59:29,643 --> 00:59:31,611
l must get going.

992
00:59:31,711 --> 00:59:32,973
You look nice.

993
00:59:33,180 --> 00:59:34,340
Thanks.

994
00:59:35,115 --> 00:59:38,778
Could l talk to you before you go?
l hardly get to see you anymore.

995
00:59:39,853 --> 00:59:41,252
Sure. What is it?

996
00:59:41,555 --> 00:59:46,458
- l just wanted to tell you...
- ''You asked for it, you got it, Toyota.''

997
00:59:47,394 --> 00:59:48,520
'Morning, Pop.

998
00:59:52,799 --> 00:59:54,061
''Non-Dairy...

999
00:59:54,734 --> 00:59:55,792
''...Creamer.''

1000
01:00:04,344 --> 01:00:06,107
''You asked for it...''

1001
01:00:07,380 --> 01:00:08,642
What's going on?

1002
01:00:13,653 --> 01:00:15,746
I’m going back to refereeing.

1003
01:00:23,864 --> 01:00:26,856
l told the league that l want
to go back to work.

1004
01:00:28,535 --> 01:00:31,993
You saw that l tried,
but l just can't do this anymore.

1005
01:00:32,239 --> 01:00:34,332
l can't sit here with him all day.

1006
01:00:34,741 --> 01:00:38,643
When you said he'd live with us,
you gave no clue what shape he was in.

1007
01:00:38,712 --> 01:00:39,940
Honey, he's sick.

1008
01:00:40,614 --> 01:00:41,808
What can l do?

1009
01:00:42,282 --> 01:00:46,343
Take him to work. He can wander
around the airport muttering.

1010
01:00:47,287 --> 01:00:49,414
Thousands of people do that.

1011
01:00:55,495 --> 01:00:58,191
lf he wasn't here everything'd be fine?

1012
01:01:01,101 --> 01:01:03,092
Ellen, l like being a referee.

1013
01:01:03,270 --> 01:01:08,173
l love being a referee. lt's a big part
of who l am and I’m starting to miss me.

1014
01:01:08,241 --> 01:01:10,141
And me is the guy you married.

1015
01:01:10,744 --> 01:01:12,905
When did you decide to do this?

1016
01:01:13,380 --> 01:01:15,143
l thought about it for two weeks.

1017
01:01:17,017 --> 01:01:21,420
Did it ever occur to you to talk to me
about it? To see what l thought?

1018
01:01:21,721 --> 01:01:23,814
l already knew what you thought.

1019
01:01:24,925 --> 01:01:26,984
But you're doing it anyway.

1020
01:01:30,230 --> 01:01:34,189
l must do this. lt's important to us.
l want to love you, not resent you.

1021
01:01:35,769 --> 01:01:37,327
You resent me?

1022
01:01:38,038 --> 01:01:42,600
'Cause when you were unhappy, l cared.
Now I’m unhappy and you don't care.

1023
01:01:42,742 --> 01:01:46,303
l just found out.
l haven't had time not to care.

1024
01:01:46,379 --> 01:01:47,573
You didn't notice?

1025
01:01:47,647 --> 01:01:51,674
Yesterday l ran out of toothpaste
and l burst into tears. ls that normal?

1026
01:01:51,818 --> 01:01:55,686
We never have sex anymore.
Has that even caught your attention?

1027
01:01:56,356 --> 01:02:00,725
We're on different schedules.
When you come home I’m asleep already.

1028
01:02:00,894 --> 01:02:02,088
When l come home--

1029
01:02:02,262 --> 01:02:06,255
We used to do it 19 times a day
in every room in the house.

1030
01:02:06,499 --> 01:02:10,435
lf the Kramers weren't home next door,
we used their place.

1031
01:02:10,770 --> 01:02:14,069
Two times. Two times you wanted
to have sex and l didn't.

1032
01:02:14,140 --> 01:02:17,701
Fifty times, l wanted to and you didn't.
Two times l asked.

1033
01:02:17,844 --> 01:02:20,404
So it's my fault? Why didn't you ask?

1034
01:02:20,780 --> 01:02:24,181
When you show no interest?
l feel like I’m begging.

1035
01:02:24,384 --> 01:02:27,012
What about when you're not interested?

1036
01:02:27,087 --> 01:02:28,418
When did that happen?

1037
01:02:28,555 --> 01:02:30,284
Last week. ln the morning.

1038
01:02:30,590 --> 01:02:32,455
Remember? l started to...

1039
01:02:32,892 --> 01:02:36,453
...do that thing you used to like.
You said, ''Get off me. What is that?''

1040
01:02:36,529 --> 01:02:40,829
<i>lt was 6:30 a.m.! That wasn't love.
You were slipping me into your schedule.</i>

1041
01:02:40,900 --> 01:02:43,300
Fine, if that's the way you see it...

1042
01:02:46,539 --> 01:02:48,097
Oh, Mickey.

1043
01:02:48,375 --> 01:02:52,311
l have a vacation coming up,
so why don't we go away?

1044
01:02:52,412 --> 01:02:54,505
We could go to Santa Barbara.

1045
01:02:55,448 --> 01:02:56,938
I’m leaving Monday.

1046
01:03:08,094 --> 01:03:10,790
How many more years will you do this?

1047
01:03:11,097 --> 01:03:12,189
What? Referee?

1048
01:03:12,265 --> 01:03:13,254
Yes.

1049
01:03:14,334 --> 01:03:15,631
l don't know.

1050
01:03:17,637 --> 01:03:20,333
Well, give me a clue. One?

1051
01:03:20,473 --> 01:03:22,236
Ten? Fifteen?

1052
01:03:23,576 --> 01:03:24,907
l don't know.

1053
01:03:27,914 --> 01:03:29,176
l got to go.

1054
01:03:55,775 --> 01:03:57,106
<i>He just left her?</i>

1055
01:03:57,277 --> 01:03:58,767
<i>Can you believe that?</i>

1056
01:03:58,945 --> 01:04:01,539
<i>- He didn't leave. He went back to work.
- Exactly.</i>

1057
01:04:01,748 --> 01:04:04,376
So his job was more important
than his wife.

1058
01:04:04,684 --> 01:04:09,451
Both were. Marriage can't work with
one person happy and the other miserable.

1059
01:04:09,522 --> 01:04:12,889
Marriage is both people being
equally miserable.

1060
01:04:14,427 --> 01:04:15,587
What?

1061
01:04:16,196 --> 01:04:17,686
No, l was just--

1062
01:04:18,298 --> 01:04:21,893
What if l lost my column
and l had to go back on the road?

1063
01:04:22,535 --> 01:04:23,797
Could that happen?

1064
01:04:23,937 --> 01:04:27,270
Of course. Papers fold, merge,
you get a new editor...

1065
01:04:27,640 --> 01:04:29,130
You never mentioned this.

1066
01:04:29,809 --> 01:04:31,777
Would it have made a difference?

1067
01:04:32,345 --> 01:04:34,745
Well, no. Not really.

1068
01:04:34,914 --> 01:04:38,042
Not really? That's a real crowd-pleaser.

1069
01:04:40,019 --> 01:04:43,853
Sure, it would make some difference.
How could it not?

1070
01:04:44,657 --> 01:04:46,488
We're getting married Sunday.

1071
01:04:46,559 --> 01:04:50,325
I’d like to know if I’m getting the first
or second Mrs. Jack.

1072
01:04:51,297 --> 01:04:56,200
Any man who refers to his wives
as ''Mrs. Jack'' is an idiot.

1073
01:04:56,503 --> 01:04:59,063
Any man who repeats it is a bigger idiot.

1074
01:05:02,008 --> 01:05:02,997
l'll...

1075
01:05:06,613 --> 01:05:09,776
- I’d better...
- Nah. Sit down, relax.

1076
01:05:10,517 --> 01:05:14,681
Lucy'll fix it. She's the Bob Vila
of relationships.

1077
01:05:15,355 --> 01:05:17,323
You're hungry, have some bread.

1078
01:05:17,524 --> 01:05:19,754
Everything'll look better after bread.

1079
01:05:19,959 --> 01:05:22,951
Why did l start anything?
Why did l say that?

1080
01:05:25,865 --> 01:05:28,095
This is good. ls there butter?

1081
01:05:29,702 --> 01:05:33,263
- lt's nothing, just pre-wedding jitters.
- You think?

1082
01:05:33,473 --> 01:05:37,034
You kidding? The week l got married
l threw up every day.

1083
01:05:37,377 --> 01:05:39,902
- Her mother was poisoning me, but--
- Stop.

1084
01:05:39,979 --> 01:05:41,537
Will you just stop?

1085
01:05:42,715 --> 01:05:44,376
Oh, l think I’m scared.

1086
01:05:44,551 --> 01:05:45,779
Of what?

1087
01:05:46,052 --> 01:05:49,488
That l parked too far from the curb.
What do you mean?

1088
01:05:49,622 --> 01:05:53,888
I’ve been single for 40 years
and I’m getting married Sunday. Oh, God!

1089
01:05:54,961 --> 01:05:56,394
Come on.

1090
01:05:56,463 --> 01:05:59,057
Take it easy. You're all right.

1091
01:05:59,232 --> 01:06:01,325
Why did l say that to him?

1092
01:06:01,468 --> 01:06:03,459
l didn't mean that.

1093
01:06:03,837 --> 01:06:06,135
Maybe I’m too scared to get married.

1094
01:06:06,272 --> 01:06:11,209
Oh, listen to me. l lost 15 pounds
for this wedding. You're getting married.

1095
01:06:12,679 --> 01:06:17,173
You shouldn't listen to Ellen and Mickey
stories before you get married.

1096
01:06:17,250 --> 01:06:20,913
lt's like watching a horror movie
before you go to bed.

1097
01:06:22,388 --> 01:06:25,118
Don't you think Mickey was wrong
and Ellen was right?

1098
01:06:25,258 --> 01:06:26,748
Of course.

1099
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:30,852
Also Ellen was wrong
and Mickey was right.

1100
01:06:31,164 --> 01:06:34,361
See, their marriage had
one overriding problem.

1101
01:06:34,634 --> 01:06:36,534
One was a man and one was a woman.

1102
01:06:38,638 --> 01:06:40,037
So what happened?

1103
01:06:40,340 --> 01:06:41,466
Did they break up?

1104
01:06:41,741 --> 01:06:43,538
lt was kind of hard to tell.

1105
01:06:43,676 --> 01:06:46,941
Were they separated because
he happened to be away...

1106
01:06:47,113 --> 01:06:51,743
<i>...or were they separated because
they were, you know, separated?</i>

1107
01:06:52,619 --> 01:06:54,780
Maybe l got married too fast.

1108
01:06:54,954 --> 01:06:58,014
No, there's no such thing
as too fast or too slow.

1109
01:06:58,191 --> 01:06:59,658
lt's whenever it's right.

1110
01:06:59,959 --> 01:07:01,950
Although you moved a little fast.

1111
01:07:02,962 --> 01:07:06,955
lt's just that when my first marriage ended
l felt so lost.

1112
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:10,460
l wasn't looking for anyone,
but then he came along.

1113
01:07:10,637 --> 01:07:11,797
Mickey.

1114
01:07:12,205 --> 01:07:15,038
He was so different from the others.
He was cute.

1115
01:07:15,308 --> 01:07:20,211
He's adorable. Every time l see him,
l want to pick him up and give him a hug.

1116
01:07:22,148 --> 01:07:25,549
The other ones were very polished.
Stylish.

1117
01:07:26,653 --> 01:07:29,315
Then this little referee shows up.

1118
01:07:29,489 --> 01:07:30,979
He made me laugh.

1119
01:07:31,157 --> 01:07:34,183
He put me on a pedestal.
He made me feel loved.

1120
01:07:34,727 --> 01:07:37,218
As only a little referee can.

1121
01:07:37,997 --> 01:07:40,659
Just what l needed to get me through that.

1122
01:07:42,168 --> 01:07:43,430
Oh, God.

1123
01:07:43,570 --> 01:07:44,559
What?

1124
01:07:44,737 --> 01:07:47,672
Do you think l married Mickey
on the rebound?

1125
01:07:50,577 --> 01:07:51,601
What's funny?

1126
01:07:52,245 --> 01:07:53,075
Get it?

1127
01:07:53,179 --> 01:07:55,511
Rebound. He's a basketball referee.

1128
01:07:58,851 --> 01:08:00,682
Keep your seats, kids.

1129
01:08:01,187 --> 01:08:05,248
- You know the difference between us?
- You still enjoy your mother bathing you?

1130
01:08:05,391 --> 01:08:10,886
No, the difference is you're a dope
and I’m not. l say it with great affection.

1131
01:08:10,964 --> 01:08:12,454
- I’m a dope?
- Craig?

1132
01:08:12,532 --> 01:08:13,692
Big dope.

1133
01:08:13,866 --> 01:08:15,959
We're both the same. We're rigid.

1134
01:08:16,102 --> 01:08:17,364
I’m not rigid.

1135
01:08:17,537 --> 01:08:19,528
- Craig?
- You're an ironing board.

1136
01:08:19,706 --> 01:08:23,699
That's not true. Please!
Come on, guys, l change.

1137
01:08:23,776 --> 01:08:24,765
- Tuna rye.
- Me.

1138
01:08:24,844 --> 01:08:25,936
- Tuna wheat.
- Me.

1139
01:08:26,012 --> 01:08:27,946
- Veal parmesan sandwich?
- Him.

1140
01:08:28,047 --> 01:08:31,539
See? l know what l am,
so l don't get married.

1141
01:08:31,718 --> 01:08:35,119
Would a woman let me spend $1,400
on old baseball cards?

1142
01:08:35,288 --> 01:08:36,983
Forget it.

1143
01:08:37,123 --> 01:08:38,784
But you married this woman.

1144
01:08:38,992 --> 01:08:43,725
And you seem upset that your life
isn't exactly the same as it was before.

1145
01:08:45,665 --> 01:08:46,927
lt isn't.

1146
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:49,290
You're married...

1147
01:08:50,069 --> 01:08:51,297
...and you're up.

1148
01:08:58,011 --> 01:08:59,501
When he travels...

1149
01:08:59,679 --> 01:09:03,775
...not only am l lonely,
l don't even know who l am by myself.

1150
01:09:04,517 --> 01:09:05,745
You don't?

1151
01:09:07,820 --> 01:09:09,651
Like when you're with a guy...

1152
01:09:09,822 --> 01:09:13,918
...not just for a night, but really
with a husband or a boyfriend...

1153
01:09:14,694 --> 01:09:19,757
...and you keep re-inventing yourself to be
the perfect woman for that relationship.

1154
01:09:19,966 --> 01:09:21,297
Yeah, right.

1155
01:09:21,701 --> 01:09:22,599
Right.

1156
01:09:24,437 --> 01:09:25,665
l don't know...

1157
01:09:26,139 --> 01:09:29,040
lf l took time before or between...

1158
01:09:29,475 --> 01:09:33,275
...you know, to find out who l really am,
by myself...

1159
01:09:33,346 --> 01:09:36,338
...who l could be, you know,
without any guy around...

1160
01:09:38,184 --> 01:09:40,448
l know I’m in here somewhere.

1161
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:44,219
l can hear myself screaming
from a distance.

1162
01:09:44,691 --> 01:09:46,750
Does Mickey know you feel this way?

1163
01:09:49,362 --> 01:09:53,196
l don't think Mickey would understand it
in the right way.

1164
01:09:53,466 --> 01:09:55,525
<i>Things just weren't comfortable anymore.</i>

1165
01:09:55,702 --> 01:09:59,331
<i>For either of them.
They were pretending to be married.</i>

1166
01:09:59,739 --> 01:10:03,334
<i>It was sad, because they were married
and they we're both very lonely.</i>

1167
01:10:03,976 --> 01:10:05,466
<i>Oh, gee.</i>

1168
01:10:05,978 --> 01:10:08,640
''Brushless Car Wash.''

1169
01:10:11,484 --> 01:10:13,975
''Mario's Pizza Town.''

1170
01:10:17,090 --> 01:10:18,717
''Laundry World.''

1171
01:10:21,494 --> 01:10:23,155
<i>They decided to get help.</i>

1172
01:10:23,229 --> 01:10:25,026
<i>They went to a marriage counsellor.</i>

1173
01:10:25,098 --> 01:10:27,191
Let me explain my philosophy.

1174
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:31,400
l see marriage simply
as a form of legalized rape.

1175
01:10:31,537 --> 01:10:34,768
<i>Mickey thought they should see
someone else. Drs. Don and Debbie.</i>

1176
01:10:34,841 --> 01:10:37,708
l don't understand. lf you miss me,
why aren't you happy...

1177
01:10:37,777 --> 01:10:39,039
...when l come home?

1178
01:10:39,378 --> 01:10:41,209
Because l know you'll leave again.

1179
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:44,477
That's logical. l'll leave,
so let's not have fun while I’m home?

1180
01:10:44,550 --> 01:10:45,642
Now it's my fault?

1181
01:10:46,719 --> 01:10:49,415
When l come home I’m excited to see you.

1182
01:10:49,589 --> 01:10:50,783
You're not excited.

1183
01:10:50,957 --> 01:10:54,393
- You're horny.
- ls that bad? ls that such a bad thing?

1184
01:10:55,128 --> 01:10:57,858
When do you two get involved?
When there's gunplay?

1185
01:11:03,803 --> 01:11:07,466
l just want it to always be like
that week in Paris.

1186
01:11:07,874 --> 01:11:09,865
lt can't be like that, Mickey.

1187
01:11:11,110 --> 01:11:12,338
l know.

1188
01:11:12,512 --> 01:11:15,276
<i>So, finally,
things weren't getting any better.</i>

1189
01:11:15,381 --> 01:11:18,009
<i>So, Ellen did what she had to do.</i>

1190
01:12:17,210 --> 01:12:19,201
Hi, you're back already.

1191
01:12:20,847 --> 01:12:22,075
Where were you?

1192
01:12:22,582 --> 01:12:24,550
Wichita. l left you a note.

1193
01:12:25,284 --> 01:12:28,117
Yeah. Well, l just got here.

1194
01:12:31,824 --> 01:12:32,882
Where's your dad?

1195
01:12:33,626 --> 01:12:34,957
Wichita.

1196
01:12:37,230 --> 01:12:38,629
What's he doing there?

1197
01:12:39,966 --> 01:12:41,957
l left him with my brothers.

1198
01:12:43,035 --> 01:12:44,730
- Really?
- Oh, Mickey...

1199
01:12:44,871 --> 01:12:46,498
l want this to work.

1200
01:12:48,374 --> 01:12:49,864
l love you.

1201
01:12:56,749 --> 01:12:59,343
Honey, I’m sorry. l didn't mean anything.

1202
01:12:59,418 --> 01:13:00,646
Me too.

1203
01:13:01,053 --> 01:13:05,513
l was crying about Mickey and Ellen.
lt's so sweet the way she came back.

1204
01:13:05,892 --> 01:13:08,019
Why do all your women end up crying?

1205
01:13:08,094 --> 01:13:09,391
She's not...

1206
01:13:09,829 --> 01:13:13,765
- This is Jack Garrett. The referee.
- Very nice to meet you.

1207
01:13:13,900 --> 01:13:15,629
I’ve heard a lot about you.

1208
01:13:17,270 --> 01:13:19,670
l was the ''As told to'' on Jack's book.

1209
01:13:19,839 --> 01:13:22,171
And this is Mrs. Jack.

1210
01:13:23,776 --> 01:13:24,936
Lois. Hi.

1211
01:13:25,011 --> 01:13:26,603
lt's very nice to meet you.

1212
01:13:26,746 --> 01:13:28,737
Congratulations. Let's eat.

1213
01:13:29,081 --> 01:13:31,413
- Craig. Lucy.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

1214
01:13:32,084 --> 01:13:33,176
Good to meet you.

1215
01:13:33,352 --> 01:13:34,284
Craig.

1216
01:13:34,420 --> 01:13:37,082
Oh yeah, you sell those Scooby-doos.

1217
01:13:39,525 --> 01:13:40,787
Subarus.

1218
01:13:42,228 --> 01:13:44,196
Asshole. Excuse me.

1219
01:13:44,363 --> 01:13:47,924
- I’m in the lane too long. Sit down.
- Whoops.

1220
01:13:49,201 --> 01:13:50,532
So, where's Mickey?

1221
01:13:50,703 --> 01:13:53,103
At the Knick game. He'll be here soon.

1222
01:13:53,306 --> 01:13:54,864
With Ellen, right?

1223
01:13:55,041 --> 01:13:56,099
Ellen?

1224
01:13:57,109 --> 01:13:58,098
Why?

1225
01:13:58,311 --> 01:14:01,712
They're still together?
When we talk, l don't ask anymore.

1226
01:14:01,881 --> 01:14:03,542
Lucy told me the whole story.

1227
01:14:03,616 --> 01:14:05,174
- The whole thing?
- About the baby?

1228
01:14:05,251 --> 01:14:06,582
- Everything?
- Shut up!

1229
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:07,845
Baby?

1230
01:14:08,888 --> 01:14:10,879
- The plot thickens.
- What baby?

1231
01:14:11,057 --> 01:14:13,116
Do they make a decent martini here?

1232
01:14:13,326 --> 01:14:16,625
Absolutely. They're like me:
dry, yet explosive.

1233
01:14:16,829 --> 01:14:17,887
What baby?

1234
01:14:18,064 --> 01:14:20,328
Dry. Straight up. Olive.

1235
01:14:20,633 --> 01:14:22,066
- Me too. Double.
- Me too.

1236
01:14:22,134 --> 01:14:23,499
- Me too.
- What baby?

1237
01:14:24,236 --> 01:14:25,294
Where'd you stop?

1238
01:14:25,404 --> 01:14:27,895
When she left her father in Wichita.

1239
01:14:28,574 --> 01:14:32,066
- Ancient history.
- Does she know about him selling cars?

1240
01:14:32,845 --> 01:14:33,937
Right, it's you.

1241
01:14:34,747 --> 01:14:36,476
That test drive.

1242
01:14:37,483 --> 01:14:42,079
Listen. lf somebody doesn't tell me
about this baby, asses will be kicked!

1243
01:14:45,891 --> 01:14:47,290
l like her.

1244
01:14:48,060 --> 01:14:49,220
All right...

1245
01:14:49,495 --> 01:14:54,432
After she dumped the old man they were,
well, they were better for a while.

1246
01:14:58,371 --> 01:14:59,668
Oh, Mickey.

1247
01:15:00,606 --> 01:15:02,437
lt's so beautiful.

1248
01:15:02,942 --> 01:15:06,605
There's something so great
about knowing we're making a baby.

1249
01:15:06,779 --> 01:15:08,679
lt's going to be wonderful.

1250
01:15:14,387 --> 01:15:16,378
Here's why you can't have children...

1251
01:15:16,455 --> 01:15:19,288
<i>Something's wrong with her plumbing.
Not like Mrs. Jack...</i>

1252
01:15:19,358 --> 01:15:21,588
<i>...she folds my underwear,
she gets pregnant.</i>

1253
01:15:21,660 --> 01:15:23,127
<i>Damaged fallopian tubes.</i>

1254
01:15:23,829 --> 01:15:26,229
<i>That's what she gets for living in France.</i>

1255
01:15:26,465 --> 01:15:30,367
<i>- What's that got to do with it?
- Maybe she was clogged up with cheese.</i>

1256
01:15:30,469 --> 01:15:33,632
<i>- Lovely. I'm telling the rest of this.
- Good.</i>

1257
01:15:34,006 --> 01:15:37,066
<i>She was devastated.
They went to a fertility clinic.</i>

1258
01:15:37,143 --> 01:15:38,474
<i>She told me everything.</i>

1259
01:15:38,811 --> 01:15:40,642
You should see the waiting room.

1260
01:15:40,813 --> 01:15:45,307
All the childless couples. You could cut
the hopelessness with a chain saw.

1261
01:15:45,818 --> 01:15:48,309
Mickey told Jack it wasn't hopeless.

1262
01:15:48,721 --> 01:15:52,987
We are trying this in vitro process
for $8,000 each attempt.

1263
01:15:53,159 --> 01:15:55,320
- Ouch.
- Ouch is right.

1264
01:15:55,494 --> 01:15:58,224
He has to give me these injections
every morning...

1265
01:15:58,431 --> 01:16:00,524
...only he gets a little queasy.

1266
01:16:04,236 --> 01:16:07,501
- l'll hold this and you jump in my lap.
- Mickey, come on.

1267
01:16:07,606 --> 01:16:12,168
Craig volunteered because he's diabetic,
but l don't want him to see your ass.

1268
01:16:12,445 --> 01:16:13,844
Just do it.

1269
01:16:14,013 --> 01:16:17,346
Okay. Okay. We're a team. We're a team.

1270
01:16:17,450 --> 01:16:18,610
Do it.

1271
01:16:23,255 --> 01:16:24,688
l didn't know that.

1272
01:16:24,757 --> 01:16:26,748
- How much an olive weighs?
- No.

1273
01:16:26,959 --> 01:16:29,359
That you wanted
to give Ellen her injections.

1274
01:16:29,528 --> 01:16:31,860
Wanted? l just volunteered.

1275
01:16:32,031 --> 01:16:33,589
That's so sweet.

1276
01:16:33,766 --> 01:16:37,202
You saying that l was trying
to cop a peek at her caboose?

1277
01:16:37,369 --> 01:16:40,395
l was trying to help some friends.
May l finish?

1278
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:43,270
lf you feel you have to, sure.

1279
01:16:43,476 --> 01:16:45,535
What we'll do is take your eggs...

1280
01:16:45,711 --> 01:16:48,043
<i>The fertility experts tell them...</i>

1281
01:16:48,180 --> 01:16:49,147
<i>...it's time.</i>

1282
01:16:49,248 --> 01:16:53,480
<i>They take some eggs from Ellen,
put them in a little dish.</i>

1283
01:16:54,220 --> 01:16:56,279
<i>Then it's time for Mickey to...</i>

1284
01:16:56,388 --> 01:16:57,719
<i>...how shall I say...</i>

1285
01:16:57,890 --> 01:17:00,290
<i>...spew his manhood into a plastic cup.</i>

1286
01:17:00,493 --> 01:17:02,723
<i>- You're a real poet.
- Thank you.</i>

1287
01:17:07,700 --> 01:17:09,133
After you.

1288
01:17:15,975 --> 01:17:18,205
Okay, can you operate a VCR?

1289
01:17:18,410 --> 01:17:21,311
Why? Did you want me
to tape something for you?

1290
01:17:21,647 --> 01:17:26,584
No. We have X-rated tapes in case
you need some help becoming aroused.

1291
01:17:26,752 --> 01:17:27,912
Help?

1292
01:17:29,855 --> 01:17:31,117
Help?

1293
01:17:31,257 --> 01:17:36,092
l lettered in this in high school, had
a picture of my right hand in my wallet.

1294
01:17:38,864 --> 01:17:40,229
We also have magazines.

1295
01:17:41,433 --> 01:17:43,594
- Will you be all right?
- Sure.

1296
01:17:43,669 --> 01:17:48,606
l wish l was in my parent's bathroom in
Brooklyn. A lot of happy memories there.

1297
01:17:49,575 --> 01:17:50,872
l'll bet.

1298
01:17:53,646 --> 01:17:55,079
Use the cup.

1299
01:17:55,481 --> 01:17:56,880
Come out when you're done.

1300
01:17:56,982 --> 01:17:58,279
Just one cup?

1301
01:18:08,460 --> 01:18:10,485
''Kim is an Aries...

1302
01:18:10,963 --> 01:18:12,931
''...who enjoys snowboarding...

1303
01:18:12,998 --> 01:18:15,728
''...and reading the Scriptures
on a rainy night.

1304
01:18:16,368 --> 01:18:17,733
''Favourite food:

1305
01:18:18,270 --> 01:18:19,703
''Juice.''

1306
01:18:21,974 --> 01:18:23,202
Excuse me.

1307
01:18:23,909 --> 01:18:24,967
All done?

1308
01:18:25,978 --> 01:18:28,139
Could l see you for a second, please?

1309
01:18:30,249 --> 01:18:32,547
- ls something wrong?
- Yes.

1310
01:18:32,818 --> 01:18:35,309
Do you have any Sophia Loren movies?
Early '60s.

1311
01:18:35,921 --> 01:18:39,322
The one where she does a striptease
for Marcello Mastroianni.

1312
01:18:39,959 --> 01:18:41,756
<i>- Barbarella?
- No.</i>

1313
01:18:42,027 --> 01:18:46,930
<i>The Dick Van Dyke episode where
Laura's in Capri pants doing, ''Rob...''</i>

1314
01:18:47,800 --> 01:18:51,327
We are not a video store.
We don't have a selection.

1315
01:18:51,704 --> 01:18:53,604
- l can't do this.
- Mr. Gordon...

1316
01:18:53,672 --> 01:18:56,300
...your wife's egg is good
for four only hours.

1317
01:18:56,475 --> 01:18:59,103
Then we might as well scrape it
into the trash.

1318
01:18:59,578 --> 01:19:02,672
Pile on the pressure.
Can't l do this at home?

1319
01:19:03,349 --> 01:19:08,184
Because the sperm has to be inserted
into the egg within one hour of...

1320
01:19:08,687 --> 01:19:12,179
<i>- ...ejaculation.
- l ejaculate 30 minutes from here.</i>

1321
01:19:13,192 --> 01:19:14,682
No, no. l mean...

1322
01:19:14,860 --> 01:19:18,023
...l live half an hour from here. Please?

1323
01:19:18,197 --> 01:19:20,688
Let me go home where l usually do this.

1324
01:19:20,866 --> 01:19:23,426
Come on. l want to go home.

1325
01:19:31,277 --> 01:19:33,939
Mickey? Are you okay in there?

1326
01:19:35,047 --> 01:19:36,446
There it is. Okay.

1327
01:19:36,515 --> 01:19:39,916
Good. There's a paper bag
on the sink there.

1328
01:19:42,655 --> 01:19:43,713
Got it.

1329
01:19:45,224 --> 01:19:46,384
My keys?

1330
01:19:46,558 --> 01:19:49,049
- They're in the car. The car's running.
- Okay.

1331
01:19:49,228 --> 01:19:50,559
What'd you think about?

1332
01:19:52,164 --> 01:19:53,153
Wish me luck.

1333
01:19:53,265 --> 01:19:54,289
Piece of cake.

1334
01:19:54,733 --> 01:19:56,564
No. Don't say that.

1335
01:20:15,688 --> 01:20:17,918
''Piece of cake! ''

1336
01:20:18,090 --> 01:20:19,421
She spooked it!

1337
01:20:23,762 --> 01:20:25,252
Hang on, boys!

1338
01:20:31,103 --> 01:20:32,502
Go, go, go!

1339
01:20:38,377 --> 01:20:41,073
Someday l'll tell you all about this, kids.

1340
01:20:46,618 --> 01:20:47,949
Know why l stopped you?

1341
01:20:48,053 --> 01:20:50,214
l did everything wrong.

1342
01:20:50,322 --> 01:20:54,156
l have to get to the hospital in 20 minutes.
Fifty thousand lives are at stake.

1343
01:20:54,226 --> 01:20:56,524
- What?
- You know what's in this bag?

1344
01:20:56,729 --> 01:20:57,627
No.

1345
01:20:57,796 --> 01:20:59,354
A cup full of sperm.

1346
01:21:00,099 --> 01:21:00,929
Get out.

1347
01:21:00,999 --> 01:21:03,763
Put your hands on the fender. Move it.

1348
01:21:04,570 --> 01:21:08,062
<i>He tries to tell the cop
that he's not a perverted lunatic.</i>

1349
01:21:08,140 --> 01:21:10,734
<i>He brings him up to date on the story.</i>

1350
01:21:27,993 --> 01:21:28,960
Thank you.

1351
01:21:29,128 --> 01:21:30,186
Good luck.

1352
01:21:32,531 --> 01:21:33,691
<i>And?</i>

1353
01:21:33,932 --> 01:21:37,561
Mrs. Gordon, calling for the results
of my pregnancy test.

1354
01:21:37,736 --> 01:21:39,135
<i>Just a moment, please.</i>

1355
01:21:51,650 --> 01:21:53,242
<i>Mrs. Gordon?</i>

1356
01:21:53,719 --> 01:21:57,712
<i>That result was negative.
I'll schedule you for another appointment.</i>

1357
01:21:57,790 --> 01:21:58,916
Thank you.

1358
01:22:00,859 --> 01:22:05,296
<i>Besides the disappointment,
she's pumped full of those hormone shots.</i>

1359
01:22:05,364 --> 01:22:07,594
<i>- She's a wreck.
- It's horrible for her.</i>

1360
01:22:07,900 --> 01:22:09,128
<i>Forget about it.</i>

1361
01:22:09,201 --> 01:22:14,104
<i>Most of that time, Mickey's back out
on the road, so she's doing this alone.</i>

1362
01:22:14,440 --> 01:22:17,238
<i>But they try again. For two years.</i>

1363
01:22:17,309 --> 01:22:18,537
<i>Two years?</i>

1364
01:22:19,611 --> 01:22:21,272
<i>Until finally...</i>

1365
01:22:22,281 --> 01:22:23,270
- Get it?
- Yeah.

1366
01:22:24,650 --> 01:22:26,140
He wants his mommy.

1367
01:22:26,618 --> 01:22:29,109
You guys look pretty natural there.

1368
01:22:29,321 --> 01:22:31,619
Come here, you beautiful boy.

1369
01:22:31,824 --> 01:22:35,555
Yes, you big boy.
Here, grab one of this shot.

1370
01:22:35,727 --> 01:22:36,955
Get him laughing.

1371
01:22:37,563 --> 01:22:40,555
- Come on, Jason. Look at Uncle Mickey.
- Say hello!

1372
01:22:50,509 --> 01:22:51,737
Cute.

1373
01:22:51,910 --> 01:22:53,241
I’m tired.

1374
01:22:53,412 --> 01:22:54,743
Let's go home.

1375
01:22:57,516 --> 01:22:59,950
l mean, I’m tired of the whole thing.

1376
01:23:00,352 --> 01:23:01,979
l want to stop.

1377
01:23:07,993 --> 01:23:09,790
Do you want to adopt?

1378
01:23:11,964 --> 01:23:13,397
l don't know.

1379
01:23:15,501 --> 01:23:16,866
l just...

1380
01:23:17,669 --> 01:23:21,662
l want some time not to have
to think about it for a while.

1381
01:23:22,274 --> 01:23:23,241
All right?

1382
01:23:24,109 --> 01:23:25,167
Okay.

1383
01:23:30,249 --> 01:23:33,810
<i>The adoption agencies were
not that cooperative.</i>

1384
01:23:33,986 --> 01:23:38,047
<i>He travelled, she worked full-time.
They were on a ten-mile-long waiting list.</i>

1385
01:23:38,123 --> 01:23:40,614
<i>We didn't see them that much after that.</i>

1386
01:23:40,926 --> 01:23:43,087
<i>- We had a baby.
- Yeah.</i>

1387
01:23:43,262 --> 01:23:45,628
<i>I saw them. It wasn't good.</i>

1388
01:23:45,697 --> 01:23:47,892
- There's a spot there.
- l can't get in.

1389
01:23:48,033 --> 01:23:50,467
- Of course you could.
- l can't get in that spot.

1390
01:23:50,702 --> 01:23:52,363
l could get in that spot.

1391
01:23:52,471 --> 01:23:56,032
- Maybe the Phantom could get in.
- What is that supposed to mean?

1392
01:23:56,208 --> 01:23:59,541
''School days, school days
Dear old golden rule days''

1393
01:23:59,878 --> 01:24:01,971
<i>It was just a matter of time.</i>

1394
01:24:02,214 --> 01:24:03,943
<i>Sit down, please.</i>

1395
01:24:04,182 --> 01:24:06,946
<i>Ever been in California, Captain?</i>

1396
01:24:07,219 --> 01:24:08,777
<i>Lots of times.</i>

1397
01:24:09,021 --> 01:24:10,113
<i>Recently?</i>

1398
01:24:12,057 --> 01:24:13,024
What?

1399
01:24:16,595 --> 01:24:18,392
l want to move to Dallas.

1400
01:24:21,767 --> 01:24:23,064
What are you saying?

1401
01:24:23,201 --> 01:24:27,228
The airline offered me a big promotion,
but l must move to Dallas and l want to.

1402
01:24:34,780 --> 01:24:38,216
lt shouldn't make a big difference to you
if you're in Dallas.

1403
01:24:38,550 --> 01:24:40,245
You'd be home the same amount.

1404
01:24:40,485 --> 01:24:41,577
Right...

1405
01:24:41,787 --> 01:24:43,186
...but I’d be in Dallas.

1406
01:24:43,255 --> 01:24:46,315
So what? lt's a city.
They have veal parmesan.

1407
01:24:50,495 --> 01:24:54,898
You know, you just can't walk into a room
and say, ''We're moving to Dallas.''

1408
01:24:55,400 --> 01:24:56,332
Why not?

1409
01:24:56,401 --> 01:24:58,062
Why not? Because...

1410
01:24:58,370 --> 01:25:00,429
...this is my home, you know?

1411
01:25:01,239 --> 01:25:02,729
I’m not giving in this time.

1412
01:25:02,808 --> 01:25:04,366
What do you mean ''this time''?

1413
01:25:04,576 --> 01:25:06,840
- l always give in to what you want.
- You?

1414
01:25:06,912 --> 01:25:09,403
Yeah, me. Do you want to see my list?

1415
01:25:09,681 --> 01:25:12,616
Do you want to see my list
while we're at it?

1416
01:25:12,851 --> 01:25:16,184
Look, they need an answer
by this week, so...

1417
01:25:16,588 --> 01:25:18,249
...make up your mind.

1418
01:25:19,324 --> 01:25:20,723
l don't need a week.

1419
01:25:22,861 --> 01:25:24,522
I’m not going.

1420
01:25:27,466 --> 01:25:32,199
<i>Must I remind you that a chain is
no stronger than its weakest link?</i>

1421
01:25:33,639 --> 01:25:35,368
Well, in that case...

1422
01:25:35,440 --> 01:25:36,930
...I’m moving to France.

1423
01:25:38,610 --> 01:25:39,770
France?

1424
01:25:43,382 --> 01:25:45,543
How did France get in the picture?

1425
01:25:45,984 --> 01:25:49,818
l had a choice, Dallas or Paris.
l wanted Paris...

1426
01:25:49,888 --> 01:25:51,753
...but l figured it wasn't fair.

1427
01:25:51,823 --> 01:25:53,450
Since you won't even move...

1428
01:25:53,558 --> 01:25:56,618
...to Dallas, l'll take the job in France.

1429
01:25:57,029 --> 01:25:58,997
That's the one l really want.

1430
01:26:16,515 --> 01:26:18,346
No, no. Stop the cab.

1431
01:26:20,318 --> 01:26:21,876
- Stop, please.
- Stop the cab.

1432
01:26:21,987 --> 01:26:24,979
Ellen, please, let's talk about this. Please.

1433
01:26:25,657 --> 01:26:28,421
- Please.
- Don't do this. We've been through it.

1434
01:26:28,694 --> 01:26:31,094
Let's go in the house and talk.

1435
01:26:31,163 --> 01:26:32,255
l must go.

1436
01:26:32,497 --> 01:26:33,896
You mean you want to go.

1437
01:26:34,132 --> 01:26:35,759
Look, are we happy?

1438
01:26:36,601 --> 01:26:38,592
Yeah. You know, sometimes...

1439
01:26:38,937 --> 01:26:41,030
We have ups and downs. Everybody does.

1440
01:26:41,106 --> 01:26:42,630
Mickey, are you happy?

1441
01:26:45,043 --> 01:26:47,341
For now it's better if we just...

1442
01:26:47,713 --> 01:26:49,704
- Separate?
- I’m not saying that.

1443
01:26:49,781 --> 01:26:53,012
You're not, but you're going to Paris
and I’m going in the house.

1444
01:26:53,351 --> 01:26:55,512
That's not staying together. Please.

1445
01:26:55,687 --> 01:26:58,679
- No. l just need to go for a while.
- Listen.

1446
01:26:58,857 --> 01:27:03,123
Stay until the season ends,
then we'll both go. We were great in Paris.

1447
01:27:03,295 --> 01:27:04,455
Forget Paris.

1448
01:27:04,730 --> 01:27:05,788
Forget it?

1449
01:27:06,131 --> 01:27:08,395
How do you forget the best week
in your life?

1450
01:27:08,633 --> 01:27:11,625
Maybe that's all we were,
just one great week.

1451
01:27:12,037 --> 01:27:13,061
Think so?

1452
01:27:15,874 --> 01:27:17,171
After four years?

1453
01:27:18,310 --> 01:27:20,710
You know what?
You're right, you should go.

1454
01:27:20,879 --> 01:27:23,143
Absolutely, go. Have a nice trip.

1455
01:27:23,582 --> 01:27:25,413
Take care of yourself.

1456
01:27:28,553 --> 01:27:29,884
Let's go, please.

1457
01:27:35,060 --> 01:27:36,186
<i>That's it?</i>

1458
01:27:37,062 --> 01:27:38,154
<i>Yeah.</i>

1459
01:27:38,663 --> 01:27:42,155
<i>No. She turns around
and comes running back, right?</i>

1460
01:27:42,400 --> 01:27:44,925
<i>Nope. She got on that plane
and flew to Paris.</i>

1461
01:27:45,337 --> 01:27:47,168
<i>And he went after her.</i>

1462
01:27:47,405 --> 01:27:51,171
<i>No. He got on another plane
to do a game in Sacramento.</i>

1463
01:27:52,511 --> 01:27:53,910
That's how it ends?

1464
01:27:55,347 --> 01:27:57,577
That was what? Four months ago.

1465
01:27:58,083 --> 01:27:59,175
Now Mickey's...

1466
01:27:59,351 --> 01:28:02,252
<i>...alone in the house
he didn't want and he's...</i>

1467
01:28:02,420 --> 01:28:04,684
<i>...you know, adjusting. Slowly.</i>

1468
01:28:05,023 --> 01:28:08,356
<i>''April in Paris</i>

1469
01:28:12,197 --> 01:28:15,530
<i>''Chestnuts in blossom</i>

1470
01:28:19,538 --> 01:28:22,939

<i>And Ellen?</i>

1477
01:28:58,009 --> 01:29:01,103
<i>I spoke to her about a month ago
in Paris, and...</i>

1478
01:29:01,580 --> 01:29:03,309
<i>...she was lonely and...</i>

1479
01:29:03,481 --> 01:29:04,641
<i>...you know...</i>

1480
01:29:06,585 --> 01:29:08,075
<i>...not bad.</i>

1481
01:29:08,520 --> 01:29:12,354
<i>But you know when you talk to someone
and they say they're fine...</i>

1482
01:29:12,724 --> 01:29:16,125
<i>...but you hear that thing in their voice
and you know they're not?</i>

1483
01:29:16,261 --> 01:29:17,922
<i>You know that thing?</i>

1484
01:29:18,430 --> 01:29:19,920
<i>She's got it.</i>

1485
01:29:23,335 --> 01:29:27,669

01:29:29,507 --> 01:29:33,841

Oh, I’m ill.

lmagine if l actually knew them
how sick I’d be.

1492
01:30:10,649 --> 01:30:12,640
That's not going to be us.

1493
01:30:16,554 --> 01:30:19,489
Can we order?
My stomach's doing the conga.

1494
01:30:19,724 --> 01:30:21,316
- The warmth.
- I’m hungry.

1495
01:30:21,493 --> 01:30:24,621
He's right. Let's get this party going.
Waiter?

1496
01:30:26,398 --> 01:30:29,162
Would you like a breakfast menu perhaps?

1497
01:30:29,768 --> 01:30:32,601
l know, it's late.
We're waiting for someone.

1498
01:30:32,771 --> 01:30:36,764
You know what happened
at the Knick game? Did they go overtime?

1499
01:30:37,008 --> 01:30:38,839
Our friend is unbelievably late.

1500
01:30:39,244 --> 01:30:44,045
<i>Those people were at the game
and they've been there for over 30 minutes.</i>

1501
01:30:44,683 --> 01:30:45,581
Well...

1502
01:30:45,917 --> 01:30:48,249
...bring us the best champagne you got.

1503
01:30:50,322 --> 01:30:52,483
- Champagne.
- We're getting married.

1504
01:30:54,192 --> 01:30:57,423
You people want to know
what happened at the Knick game?

1505
01:30:59,431 --> 01:31:00,864
Weird game.

1506
01:31:01,032 --> 01:31:03,432
l never saw something like this in my life.

1507
01:31:03,501 --> 01:31:04,934
What happened?

1508
01:31:06,037 --> 01:31:07,299
lt was incredible.

1509
01:31:07,472 --> 01:31:09,463
We're waiting for the anthem to start.

1510
01:31:12,610 --> 01:31:14,271
Are you all right tonight?

1511
01:31:15,313 --> 01:31:17,042
- Are you okay?
- I’m fine.

1512
01:31:17,115 --> 01:31:19,709
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, please rise...</i>

1513
01:31:19,818 --> 01:31:22,548
<i>...as we honour America
with our national anthem.</i>

1514
01:31:23,388 --> 01:31:26,221
<i>Please welcome David Sanborn.</i>

1515
01:31:52,484 --> 01:31:54,418
- What?
- l can't do the game.

1516
01:31:54,586 --> 01:31:56,417
- You sick?
- l must catch a plane.

1517
01:31:56,488 --> 01:31:57,580
- To where?
- Paris.

1518
01:31:57,655 --> 01:31:59,748
Now? No, you can't do that.

1519
01:32:00,125 --> 01:32:03,686
l won't let you go.
They'll throw you out of the league.

1520
01:32:03,928 --> 01:32:05,486
lf they do, they do.

1521
01:32:28,720 --> 01:32:30,449
l don't believe this.

1522
01:32:30,855 --> 01:32:33,187
- l was on my way to see you.
- Come on.

1523
01:32:33,525 --> 01:32:36,619
No, l swear. l was on my way to Paris.

1524
01:32:36,961 --> 01:32:39,930
Oh, forget Paris. l hated Paris.

1525
01:32:43,468 --> 01:32:45,800
What's the answer? Why will it work...

1526
01:32:45,870 --> 01:32:46,962
...this time?

1527
01:32:47,138 --> 01:32:48,469
l don't know.

1528
01:32:49,207 --> 01:32:51,869
l know we're better together
than we are apart.

1529
01:32:53,211 --> 01:32:54,872
And l'll move to Dallas...

1530
01:32:55,313 --> 01:32:59,807
...or Paris or the dark side of the moon,
because home is wherever you are.

1531
01:33:02,020 --> 01:33:03,544
And l also know...

1532
01:33:04,722 --> 01:33:06,155
...l love you.

1533
01:33:08,993 --> 01:33:10,984
So, tell me the truth.

1534
01:33:11,229 --> 01:33:13,163
Do you think we'll make it?

1535
01:33:17,735 --> 01:33:19,168
Piece of cake.

1536
01:33:41,459 --> 01:33:43,188
Then the Knicks lost.

1537
01:33:43,595 --> 01:33:44,926
They stink.

1538
01:33:45,730 --> 01:33:49,222
Well, let me get back to my food.
Have a good night.

1539
01:33:53,438 --> 01:33:56,669
lt's her. l know it's her.

1540
01:33:56,941 --> 01:33:58,932
lt's meant to be.

1541
01:34:01,980 --> 01:34:04,642
Why does every woman you're with
end up crying?

1542
01:34:07,552 --> 01:34:08,712
lt's them.

1543
01:34:18,296 --> 01:34:19,354
Ellen and Mickey.

1544
01:34:19,430 --> 01:34:21,159
Nice to meet you. You okay?

1545
01:34:21,299 --> 01:34:23,130
- Oh, yeah.
- You are.

1546
01:34:23,301 --> 01:34:25,064
- She'll be fine.
- Congratulations.

1547
01:34:25,236 --> 01:34:26,464
Look who's here.

1548
01:34:32,577 --> 01:34:37,480
Champagne. Best we got. lt's like me:
bubbly and dying to go home.

1549
01:34:38,149 --> 01:34:40,208
l would like to make a toast.

1550
01:34:41,653 --> 01:34:43,086
To my father...

1551
01:34:44,189 --> 01:34:46,180
...who did one really great thing.

1552
01:34:46,257 --> 01:34:47,815
He brought us together.

1553
01:34:49,861 --> 01:34:51,328
To marriage.

1554
01:34:53,565 --> 01:34:54,554
Let's eat.

1555
01:34:55,900 --> 01:34:58,869
Sounds good to me.
Young fellow, you first.

1556
01:34:59,404 --> 01:35:00,735
Me? Oh, okay.

1557
01:35:03,141 --> 01:35:05,371
l know exactly what l'll have.

1558
01:35:05,910 --> 01:35:07,741
l would like the veal...

1559
01:35:10,181 --> 01:35:11,273
...piccata.

1560
01:35:16,187 --> 01:35:20,453
What the hell! Me too. I’m done with this.
I’m eating tonight.

1561
01:35:20,625 --> 01:35:22,183
- Veal parmesan.
- Me too.

1562
01:35:22,360 --> 01:35:23,850
The blonde. Seven piccatas.

1563
01:35:24,028 --> 01:35:25,620
Liz, you must not know what...

1564
01:35:25,697 --> 01:35:29,189
...the toast is about.
When Mickey's father passed away...

1565
01:35:29,267 --> 01:35:32,703
...he wanted to be buried in France.
l was working in Paris.

1566
01:35:33,538 --> 01:35:35,699
You don't know that that's a true story.

1567
01:35:35,873 --> 01:35:39,309
Helen, this is all veal.
Seven piccata, one parmesan.

1568
01:35:39,544 --> 01:35:42,206
Fire it right up. l got a hungry group here.

1569
01:35:42,313 --> 01:35:46,807
For two days it was lost in Switzerland
and Ellen found it.

1570
01:35:46,985 --> 01:35:50,716
That's true. That's how we met.
You know that story, don't you?
