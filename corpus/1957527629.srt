What's with that?

173
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:03,000
Once a team gets up by 40,
they turn off the scoreboard. Game over.

174

Kind of put an end

Did you, honey?

good prospects too early.

You were personally great.

186

198
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:31,875
The league don't want the boys
to feel too bad about themselves.

199
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:33,458
I think it makes 'em feel worse.

200
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:35,625
- Definitely doesn't feel great.

The only place I've been
other than my hotel for the last week?

506
00:27:18,208 --> 00:27:19,250
Yeah, I got an idea.

507
00:27:21,416 --> 00:27:22,666
I meant from my house.

508
00:27:23,958 --> 00:27:28,375
You know I used to live there, right?
Before the dream catchers and salt lamps.

509
00:27:29,916 --> 00:27:30,916
I've been told.

510
00:27:34,708 --> 00:27:35,708
So,

511
00:27:36,583 --> 00:27:39,833
guess who the new offensive coordinator
for the Warriors is?

512
00:27:41,791 --> 00:27:42,791
How did that happen?

513
00:27:44,125 --> 00:27:45,291
Coach Troy asked me,

514
00:27:45,375 --> 00:27:48,375
and I thought it'd be cool
because we'll get to hang.

515
00:27:49,208 --> 00:27:50,208
Hang?

516
00:27:50,833 --> 00:27:53,208
Yeah. What we're doing right now. Hangin'.

517
00:27:54,416 --> 00:27:57,166
It's tough enough right now
with you just in the bleachers.

518

[scoffs] I don't give a crap
about what Paulie's dad thinks.

Maybe I do.

Hell yeah, I want stuffed crust.
What kind of question's that?

522
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:14,083
Paulie, are you seriously
ordering a pizza right now?

523
00:28:14,166 --> 00:28:15,541
We're about to practice.

524

so it gets here at the peak of my hunger.

525

I don't care. Hang up the phone.

hasn't got off to the best start.

Oh, oh, we can do better than that.

543

But to clarify,
Coach Payton is third in line.

544
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:14,750
In other words,
if Coach Troy were the president,

545
00:29:14,833 --> 00:29:16,166
I'd be the vice president.

546
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:18,958
And if Coach Troy
happened to get assassinated,

547
00:29:19,041 --> 00:29:20,375
I'd take over.

548
00:29:20,458 --> 00:29:22,708
Coach Payton would then become
the vice president.

Um, what happens
if both of you guys got shot?

I don't think we could play that game.

[Sean] Hey, uh, Dennis, come here.

671
00:35:01,708 --> 00:35:04,916
So you, uh...
you wanna tackle that guy, huh?

672
00:35:05,625 --> 00:35:07,791
I mean, I did. Then I didn't.

673
00:35:09,791 --> 00:35:11,583
Coach Troy and I
have been thinking about it,

674
00:35:11,666 --> 00:35:13,708
and we're gonna move you to fullback.

675
00:35:14,416 --> 00:35:17,666
Fullback? I-I can't play fullback.
Everyone's gonna try and hit me.

676
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:19,708
Well, you better make sure
that they don't.

677
00:35:25,541 --> 00:35:28,791
That was good.
Some real sports psychology right there.

678
00:35:28,875 --> 00:35:30,041
Yeah, a little bit.

679
00:35:30,125 --> 00:35:31,125
[Troy chuckles]

680
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:33,208
What you got in there?

681
00:35:33,291 --> 00:35:34,333
Uh, it's for my...

682
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:37,375
It's for my, uh, skin condition.

683
00:35:39,041 --> 00:35:40,041
Yeah.

684
00:35:41,208 --> 00:35:46,041
I want 42 long, I-formation,
wideout trips, all right? Go, go, go, go!

685
00:35:48,041 --> 00:35:49,541
All right, huddle up, uh...

686
00:35:50,416 --> 00:35:55,208
42 long, I-formation wide,
something, something.

687
00:35:55,291 --> 00:35:58,041
- Wait. Am I the formation?
- Who's number 42?

688
00:35:58,125 --> 00:36:00,250
- Dennis, we're on offense.
- They told me to come.

689
00:36:00,333 --> 00:36:02,916
- Where am I supposed to line up?
- You're the center.

690
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Right.

691
00:36:04,041 --> 00:36:05,666
Didn't any of you study the plays?

692
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:07,708
My dad didn't even understand these plays.

693
00:36:07,791 --> 00:36:09,875
- Everyone, just go long.
- Okay, ready?

694
00:36:09,958 --> 00:36:10,958
[all] Ready!

695
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,041
[man] Watch that pass! Watch that pass!

696
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:17,708
Set! Set!

697
00:36:17,791 --> 00:36:20,458
Blue, white. Blue, white. Hut!

698
00:36:20,541 --> 00:36:21,875
[grunting]

699
00:36:21,958 --> 00:36:24,041
[dramatic music plays]

700
00:36:27,791 --> 00:36:30,208
[grunting]

701
00:36:31,125 --> 00:36:32,125
[grunting]

702
00:36:33,125 --> 00:36:34,125
[grunts]

703
00:36:37,583 --> 00:36:39,125
- [boy] Whoa!
- Uh, thanks.

704
00:36:39,791 --> 00:36:40,833
[boy] Way to go, Coach.

705
00:36:40,916 --> 00:36:42,458
[woman] Good job, good job.

706
00:36:42,541 --> 00:36:44,416
Marcos, nice throw.

707
00:36:47,666 --> 00:36:50,250
All right. Hey, good first half.

708
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:52,541
Some minor adjustments, all right? Marcos.

709
00:36:52,625 --> 00:36:53,500
Coach.

710
00:36:53,583 --> 00:36:55,583
You are the most talented player
on our team.

711
00:36:55,666 --> 00:36:56,958
- Too true.
- Don't remind him.

712
00:36:57,041 --> 00:36:59,208
- Second most talented.
- [laughter]

713
00:36:59,291 --> 00:37:02,541
Focus up, boys.
Listen. You're not a quarterback.

714
00:37:02,625 --> 00:37:05,351
- We're moving you to running back.
- I'll do both. I could do it all.

715
00:37:05,375 --> 00:37:08,166
You can't play QB and running back
at the same time.

716
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:10,458
All good. Whatever the team needs, baby.

717
00:37:10,541 --> 00:37:12,041
Okay. What did you call me?

718
00:37:13,041 --> 00:37:14,559
- Coach.
- [Sean] That's what I thought.

719
00:37:14,583 --> 00:37:17,250
- Brian, you're new starting quarterback.
- Yes!

720
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:19,458
Finally! You can all suck it.

721
00:37:19,541 --> 00:37:22,375
Brian, you know in the NFL,
when the linemen don't like the QB,

722
00:37:22,458 --> 00:37:24,875
you know what they do?
They let the defense through.

723
00:37:25,458 --> 00:37:27,500
Sorry, everybody. I'll suck it.

724
00:37:27,583 --> 00:37:28,583
[boy] Yeah!

725
00:37:28,625 --> 00:37:30,000
Okay, guys, let's go.

726
00:37:30,666 --> 00:37:32,791
[Sean] Everybody else,
you're in the same positions.

727
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:35,500
Let's get some effort.
A little energy. Let's go!

728
00:37:35,583 --> 00:37:36,833
[boys shouting]

729
00:37:37,583 --> 00:37:39,125
Sure about doing this at halftime?

730
00:37:39,208 --> 00:37:41,583
What we were doing wasn't workin'.
We gotta adjust.

731
00:37:41,666 --> 00:37:44,291
I don't wanna adjust these kids
into the emergency room.

732
00:37:44,375 --> 00:37:45,208
They'll be fine.

733
00:37:45,291 --> 00:37:47,851
They can barely play the positions
they've been playing all year.

734
00:37:49,416 --> 00:37:50,625
[whistle blows]

735
00:37:58,541 --> 00:38:02,083
They're all in different places.
That's good?

736
00:38:02,166 --> 00:38:03,583
He switched it all up.

737
00:38:04,166 --> 00:38:05,916
[Connor] Dennis, I think you're over here.

738
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,708
- Why ain't Marcos the quarterback?
- I don't know.

739
00:38:10,875 --> 00:38:13,500
Ready. Set. Go!

740
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:16,041
[dramatic music plays]

741
00:38:22,958 --> 00:38:24,041
[groans]

742
00:38:24,125 --> 00:38:26,666
Now that could not have been
an actual play.

743
00:38:27,333 --> 00:38:30,958
Maybe we go back to the old, dumb,
peewee playbook for the rest of the game.

744
00:38:31,041 --> 00:38:34,291
I know this is like buildin' an airplane
while you're flyin' it, but trust me.

745
00:38:34,375 --> 00:38:39,125
Yeah, more like crappin' in a rainstorm
when you're buildin' an outhouse.

746
00:38:39,708 --> 00:38:42,291
- That doesn't make sense.
- Neither do these plays, Troy.

747
00:38:42,375 --> 00:38:45,208
Let's get you some water.
Come on, come on.

748
00:38:45,291 --> 00:38:46,625
Let's go. Field goal unit.

749
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:53,250
[tense music plays]

750
00:38:54,583 --> 00:38:56,458
What the hell is he lookin' at?

751
00:39:04,083 --> 00:39:05,083
[Connor] Harlan.

752
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:08,500
Hike.

753
00:39:11,125 --> 00:39:13,083
[Paulie groans] My butthole!

754
00:39:13,166 --> 00:39:14,416
Come on!

755
00:39:17,333 --> 00:39:18,416
[man] Hey, Payton!

756
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:21,125
You can't just switch everything up.
This ain't no merry-go-round.

757
00:39:21,208 --> 00:39:24,250
What you doin'? Marcos has been
a quarterback his whole life.

758
00:39:24,333 --> 00:39:26,333
He'll be a running back
for the rest of it.

759
00:39:26,416 --> 00:39:28,208
Are you blind? My boy's got a cannon.

760
00:39:28,291 --> 00:39:30,333
He's the best player on the team
besides Paulie.

761
00:39:30,416 --> 00:39:32,416
He's more of an asset as a running back.

762
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:36,500
He's not one of your assets.
He's my son, and he's a quarterback.

763
00:39:36,583 --> 00:39:37,583
Here's the thing.

764
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:39,583
I'm here to win games,

765
00:39:39,666 --> 00:39:42,625
not make you feel better
about what position your son's playing.

766
00:39:42,708 --> 00:39:44,875
So stay in the stands with the parents,

767
00:39:44,958 --> 00:39:46,958
and I'll be on the sidelines
with the coaches.

768
00:39:48,666 --> 00:39:51,208
Guys, give it a chance, please.

769
00:39:56,083 --> 00:39:59,333
I think we're, uh, finished here, fellas,
for the day.

770
00:40:02,208 --> 00:40:03,958
The bus is full anyway.

771
00:40:08,458 --> 00:40:10,916
Man, I expected today to go better.

772
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:14,125
Yeah, we're worse than we were
before he showed up.

773
00:40:14,208 --> 00:40:17,375
I thought this guy was supposed to be
some type of Super Bowl-winning coach.

774
00:40:17,458 --> 00:40:19,916
Yeah, and we scored a touchdown
without him.

775
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:20,916
[Paulie] Yeah.

776
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,500
<i>♪ We scored a touchdown!
We scored a touchdown! ♪</i>

777
00:40:27,583 --> 00:40:29,583
All right, boys, listen up.

778
00:40:29,666 --> 00:40:34,083
I know it might not have felt like it,
but I saw a lot of improvement out there.

779
00:40:34,166 --> 00:40:35,966
As soon as we get a handle
on these new plays,

780
00:40:36,041 --> 00:40:38,000
we're gonna turn things around real quick.

781
00:40:38,083 --> 00:40:42,083
Yeah, um, Coach, I don't think any of us
understand the new plays.

782
00:40:42,166 --> 00:40:45,041
What? Who's having trouble
with the playbook?

783
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,125
[Gus laughs] It looks unanimous.

784
00:40:51,208 --> 00:40:52,208
[laughs]

785
00:40:52,291 --> 00:40:54,958
[Sean] Gotta line up here.
I want everybody hip-to-hip here.

786
00:40:55,041 --> 00:40:57,958
I don't want any space here.
People were getting through here.

787
00:40:58,041 --> 00:41:00,125
Salt shaker right there... Okay?

788
00:41:00,208 --> 00:41:01,708
We gotta get set up here.

789
00:41:01,791 --> 00:41:04,166
Connor, Jason, you are our tortilla chips.

790
00:41:04,250 --> 00:41:08,041
That means, Dennis and Marcos,
you're our lime wedges. You're right here.

791
00:41:08,125 --> 00:41:12,291
- Which makes our hot sauce... That's Brian.
- Brian's more of a napkin. [laughs]

792
00:41:12,375 --> 00:41:16,125
We're going green right formation.
That's our initial formation. You with me?

793
00:41:16,208 --> 00:41:17,416
[all] Yes, Coach. Yeah.

794
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:21,375
Great. Okay. Now we have our X chip
on the side here, and our Z...

795
00:41:21,458 --> 00:41:24,000
- Where's the Z chip? What did you do?
- Sorry.

796
00:41:24,083 --> 00:41:25,375
All right. Okay, here we go.

797
00:41:25,458 --> 00:41:28,541
We got our Z chip here,
but we're gonna send our Z chip in motion.

798
00:41:28,625 --> 00:41:31,000
Now we have both wide receivers
on this side.

799
00:41:31,083 --> 00:41:34,708
Once they cross the line of scrimmage,
they cut right, which means our hot sauce...

800
00:41:34,791 --> 00:41:37,083
- I drop back and fake it to the lime.
- Yes.

801
00:41:37,166 --> 00:41:39,166
I'm the lime.
I pretend to get the ball and block?

802
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:40,250
[Sean] Yeah.

803
00:41:40,333 --> 00:41:43,625
- Jason and I cut to the right.
- I throw it to the open tortilla chip.

804
00:41:43,708 --> 00:41:45,250
Yes! There you go!

805
00:41:45,333 --> 00:41:47,416
[applause]

806
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:48,875
[Sean] Now let's go with X whip.

807
00:41:48,958 --> 00:41:51,476
We're gonna do the same thing,
but we're not linin' up that way.

808
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:53,541
We'll bring this chip here. Don't eat it.

809
00:41:53,625 --> 00:41:56,166
[Dennis] Hey, Coach, what if a cupcake
tries to attack 'em?

810
00:41:56,250 --> 00:41:59,166
- [Sean] You're afraid of a cupcake now?
- [Paulie] Cupcakes sound good.

811
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:01,291
- Can I see a dessert menu?
- [laughter]

812
00:42:01,375 --> 00:42:04,375
[Sean] You get that first step,
you're up the sideline, you know?

813
00:42:04,458 --> 00:42:05,458
It's all you.

814
00:42:06,916 --> 00:42:09,416
You gonna stick around
for the rest of the season?

815
00:42:10,708 --> 00:42:14,875
Well, if I win my appeal, I'll probably...
I'll probably have to go back.

816
00:42:17,625 --> 00:42:18,625
Con,

817
00:42:19,208 --> 00:42:20,208
it's my job.

818
00:42:21,916 --> 00:42:26,000
- [sighs] I wish you guys were closer.
- Why can't you be closer?

819
00:42:26,083 --> 00:42:29,541
Coach the Cowboys.
Dallas is, like, 45 minutes away.

820
00:42:29,625 --> 00:42:31,500
'Cause Dallas already has a coach.

821
00:42:32,083 --> 00:42:33,083
[Sean sighs]

822
00:42:33,625 --> 00:42:34,625
Look,

823
00:42:35,666 --> 00:42:37,375
I know this hasn't been easy.

824
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:39,500
No, you don't.

825
00:42:40,583 --> 00:42:41,583
[Sean] What do you mean?

826
00:42:45,125 --> 00:42:46,291
What is it, Con?

827
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,500
[sighs] People always ask me about you.

828
00:42:53,458 --> 00:42:56,291
And most of the time,
I have to just make it up, because...

829
00:42:59,833 --> 00:43:00,833
I don't know you.

830
00:43:02,708 --> 00:43:03,958
[sighs]

831
00:43:04,041 --> 00:43:07,541
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
C-Connor, look, I'm here.

832
00:43:08,208 --> 00:43:09,208
I'm here now.

833
00:43:10,666 --> 00:43:11,875
You can ask me anything.

834
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:14,666
What do you wanna know?

835
00:43:19,541 --> 00:43:22,750
What made you decide to go
for the onside kick in the Super Bowl?

836
00:43:24,416 --> 00:43:25,666

That's what I did with that onside kick.
I knew it would surprise 'em, and it did.

What happened with your team.

843
00:43:46,833 --> 00:43:48,125
It's complicated, Connor.

844
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:51,833
But look, at the end of the day,
I'm the head coach,

845
00:43:51,916 --> 00:43:54,541
so I-I-I've gotta be the one
to take responsibility.

846

If you're taking responsibility,
then why are you appealing?

00:51:48,333 --> 00:51:50,791
They've been league champs
for four years in a row.

1011
00:51:50,875 --> 00:51:52,750
Hope they don't humiliate us too bad.

1012
00:51:52,833 --> 00:51:54,833
Hey, <i>muy pesimistico.</i>

1013
00:51:54,916 --> 00:51:58,875
[Cindy laughs]

1014
00:51:58,958 --> 00:52:01,291
Oh, you're so funny, Sean.

1015
00:52:01,375 --> 00:52:06,000
[Cindy laughs]

1016
00:52:09,125 --> 00:52:10,458
[Cindy clears throat]

1017
00:52:10,541 --> 00:52:15,083
But I sense a lot of pain
underneath that jovial exterior.

1018
00:52:15,166 --> 00:52:17,083
Was it a rough breakup with Beth?

1019
00:52:17,166 --> 00:52:19,166
It was... It was just one of those things.

1020
00:52:19,250 --> 00:52:20,791
Oh, I see.

1021
00:52:21,291 --> 00:52:25,250
Yeah, those skinny girls
can never handle a strong, robust man.

1022
00:52:25,333 --> 00:52:28,208
They snap like a twig under real pressure.

1023
00:52:29,625 --> 00:52:32,041
I don't think we should talk about it
in front of Dennis.

1024
00:52:32,125 --> 00:52:33,958
- Dennis, go to your room.
- But I'm hungry.

1025
00:52:34,041 --> 00:52:35,791
You always hungry.

1026
00:52:35,875 --> 00:52:40,625
I'm pretty hungry too. It smells amazing.
So why don't we, uh, get to dinner, huh?

1027
00:52:41,250 --> 00:52:43,125
You should see how I do on breakfast.

1028
00:52:44,708 --> 00:52:45,708
Oh, hold on now.

1029
00:52:46,250 --> 00:52:47,875
Oh, eyelash stuck. Hold on.

1030
00:52:47,958 --> 00:52:51,166
Let me just see if I can just
put my fingernail up in there.

1031
00:52:51,250 --> 00:52:53,500
And, nope. Damn it. I can't get it open.

1032
00:52:53,583 --> 00:52:56,000
I need to run to the ladies' room
to unstick this.

1033
00:52:56,083 --> 00:52:58,458
It won't be but a minute. [giggles]

1034
00:52:58,541 --> 00:53:00,916
Dennis, check on that gumbo.

1035
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,833
- I don't wanna get it burnt up for Coach.
- Yes, Mama.

1036
00:53:04,625 --> 00:53:07,416
[cell phone rings]

1037
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:10,791
- I gotta take this. This is important.
- This is your chance to get out.

1038
00:53:11,916 --> 00:53:14,833
- Yeah. Tell your mom I said thank you.
<i>- </i>Just go!

1039
00:53:16,541 --> 00:53:19,500
Hey, great timing with the call.
How'd we do?

1040
00:53:19,583 --> 00:53:22,434
[male voice] <i>Sorry. It's over.
They aren't gonna let you coach this year.</i>

1041
00:53:22,458 --> 00:53:24,958
What? You said
you were out in front of this thing.

1042
00:53:25,041 --> 00:53:27,625
- [man 1] Come on, guys. Let's go.
- [whistle blows]

1043
00:53:27,708 --> 00:53:29,125
[man 2] There he is. Hurry up.

1044
00:53:29,208 --> 00:53:31,541
You lost your appeal with the NFL.
Any comments?

1045
00:53:31,625 --> 00:53:33,541
I'm just here
to watch my son play football.

1046
00:53:33,625 --> 00:53:36,083
It has nothing to do
with my situation with the NFL.

1047
00:53:36,166 --> 00:53:37,666
- Just a few questions.
- No comment.

1048
00:53:37,750 --> 00:53:40,000
- [Brian] Hey, Marcos, say something.
- I have a comment.

1049
00:53:40,083 --> 00:53:41,250
Coach Payton is the best!

1050
00:53:41,333 --> 00:53:43,750
- Yeah!
- [Troy] Come on. Let's go.

1051
00:53:43,833 --> 00:53:46,458
- We got a game. Focus.
- Harlan loves you, Brooke Davis!

1052
00:53:46,541 --> 00:53:49,333
- [Brian] Not guilty!
- No comment. No comment.

1053
00:53:49,416 --> 00:53:50,916
They weren't asking you nothin'.

1054
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,875
- [man] Porcupine! Stick 'em!
- [team grunts]

1055
00:53:53,958 --> 00:53:55,375
- [man] Stick 'em!
- [team grunts]

1056
00:53:55,875 --> 00:53:57,083
[man] Stick 'em!

1057
00:53:59,375 --> 00:54:00,875
- [man] Stick 'em!
- [team grunts]

1058
00:54:01,375 --> 00:54:03,083
[dramatic music plays]

1059
00:54:06,583 --> 00:54:08,333
Hey, don't... don't look at them.

1060
00:54:09,250 --> 00:54:11,666
Eyes up here, guys. Let's go. Come on.

1061
00:54:11,750 --> 00:54:14,750
Why, ain't this nice?
Super Bowl-winning coach.

1062
00:54:15,375 --> 00:54:17,375
Eastern Illinois Hall of Fame.

1063
00:54:17,458 --> 00:54:20,291
Coach of the Year, 2006.

1064
00:54:21,666 --> 00:54:22,666
And now you're here.

1065
00:54:23,250 --> 00:54:24,625
- Porcupine!
- [team grunts]

1066
00:54:24,708 --> 00:54:26,166
- Stick 'em!
- [team grunts]

1067
00:54:28,750 --> 00:54:30,958
[grunting]

1068
00:54:31,041 --> 00:54:31,916
[yelping]

1069
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
- [grunting]
- [whistle blows]

1070
00:54:34,083 --> 00:54:36,500
Oh! [chuckles]

1071
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:40,041
Personal foul! Roughing the passer!

1072
00:54:40,541 --> 00:54:41,541
Yes!

1073
00:54:41,625 --> 00:54:44,583
[man] Was that Drew Brees we just
dropped? Don't look like Drew Brees.

1074
00:54:44,666 --> 00:54:47,875
Not quite the same footwork. [laughs]

1075
00:54:47,958 --> 00:54:50,083
Give me some.
You gotta give me some quicker.

1076
00:54:50,166 --> 00:54:54,416
I mean, there's no way these guys are 12.
52 doesn't look like no kid.

1077
00:54:55,083 --> 00:54:56,458
He looks like he has a kid.

1078
00:54:58,041 --> 00:55:01,166
[boy] Set. Blue, 88. Blue, 88. Hike.

1079
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,333
[Paulie screams]

1080
00:55:04,291 --> 00:55:05,333
[man] Go! Go!

1081
00:55:06,166 --> 00:55:08,958
[commentator] <i>That's another touchdown
for the Porcupines.</i>

1082
00:55:09,041 --> 00:55:09,875
[boy] Yes!

1083
00:55:09,958 --> 00:55:11,375
[man] Hey, Fancy Pants!

1084
00:55:11,458 --> 00:55:13,791
Your big ole trophy don't scare me.

1085
00:55:13,875 --> 00:55:16,250
You in football country now. I own you.

1086
00:55:16,333 --> 00:55:18,541
- [man laughs]
- Is there any way to stop them?

1087
00:55:19,083 --> 00:55:21,125
Not unless you wanna put Gus on the line.

1088
00:55:21,208 --> 00:55:22,750
Put me in, Coach.

1089
00:55:24,458 --> 00:55:26,291
Down, set, go.

1090
00:55:31,125 --> 00:55:34,000
Fumble! Go! Go! Go!

1091
00:55:34,708 --> 00:55:35,833
[crowd cheers]

1092
00:55:39,041 --> 00:55:40,500
[grunting]

1093
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:43,500
[dramatic music plays]

1094
00:55:52,791 --> 00:55:56,083
[commentator] <i>And that's another touchdown
for the Porcupines.</i>

1095
00:55:56,166 --> 00:55:57,458
It's too easy!

1096
00:55:57,541 --> 00:55:59,500
[commentator] <i>Which will
close this one out.</i>

1097
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,125
[reporter] Guys, just a disastrous effort
by Sean Payton.

1098
00:56:03,208 --> 00:56:04,208
That's that.

1099
00:56:07,166 --> 00:56:08,916
[man laughs]

1100
00:56:09,666 --> 00:56:10,916
Good game, Big Time.

1101
00:56:11,416 --> 00:56:13,500
<i>You remember
the last time Sean Payton was on?</i>

1102
00:56:13,583 --> 00:56:16,958
<i>I think he injured his shoulder.
He was pattin' himself on the back,</i>

1103
00:56:17,041 --> 00:56:20,625
<i>telling us the offensive innovator
and all this great stuff.</i>

1104
00:56:20,708 --> 00:56:22,750
<i>Well, he lost his appeal.</i>

1105
00:56:22,833 --> 00:56:25,125
<i>The Saints just won
their first game without him,</i>

1106
00:56:25,208 --> 00:56:27,708
<i>and he's coaching
his 12-year-old son's football team.</i>

1107
00:56:27,791 --> 00:56:30,500
<i>And what did they do
with Sean Payton as their head coach?</i>

1108
00:56:30,583 --> 00:56:33,625
<i>They got crushed
by their crosstown rivals, the Porcupines.</i>

1109
00:56:33,708 --> 00:56:38,041
<i>Woo! That's the hit
you only see in your nightmares. </i>[laughs]

1110
00:56:38,125 --> 00:56:43,166
[TV] <i>I know that coach, Daryl Fitzsimmons,
had to love this, because he...</i>

1111
00:56:43,250 --> 00:56:45,375
Hey, change the channel, would you?

1112
00:56:46,333 --> 00:56:47,791
<i>Doesn't get any worse than that...</i>

1113
00:56:47,875 --> 00:56:50,541
<i>Ouch. Maybe Payton's lost his magic touch.</i>

1114
00:56:50,625 --> 00:56:53,416
<i>It makes you wonder
if the Saints will even bring him back.</i>

1115
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:55,708
<i>Maybe they'll hire
the coach from the Porcupines.</i>

1116
00:56:55,791 --> 00:56:58,250
That Porcupines coach is pretty good.

1117
00:56:59,250 --> 00:57:00,916
Has some funny zingers.

1118
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,333
Like, one time at a gas station,

1119
00:57:03,416 --> 00:57:07,791
he told me I looked like
if Ellen DeGeneres and a robot had a baby.

1120
00:57:07,875 --> 00:57:09,125
So good.

1121
00:57:12,166 --> 00:57:13,166
God.

1122
00:57:19,833 --> 00:57:23,500
Payton, maybe it's time to give Marcos
another chance at QB? What do you say?

1123
00:57:23,583 --> 00:57:26,833
Hey, Calvin. Funny, I didn't hear from you
when we won six straight.

1124
00:57:26,916 --> 00:57:29,500
Yeah, and Paulie's tired
of getting kicked in the ass too.

1125
00:57:29,583 --> 00:57:31,958
All right. I forgot my notebook
on the sidelines.

1126
00:57:32,041 --> 00:57:34,333
Let me go grab it
so I can write some notes down.

1127
00:57:34,833 --> 00:57:37,166
- Oh. Okay.
- Thanks for considering that.

1128
00:57:42,791 --> 00:57:45,250
- You mind if I address the whole team?
- Be my guest.

1129
00:57:45,833 --> 00:57:47,083
[whistle blows]

1130
00:57:47,166 --> 00:57:48,333
Everybody, take a knee.

1131
00:57:52,041 --> 00:57:53,791
That was a bad loss.

1132
00:57:54,416 --> 00:57:56,291
We are going to get our revenge.

1133
00:57:56,375 --> 00:57:57,916
We don't play them again.

1134
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,000
Oh, thank God.

1135
00:57:59,458 --> 00:58:03,375
We play them again in 27 days.
In the championship game.

1136
00:58:03,458 --> 00:58:05,875
I know they're gonna be
at the championship game,

1137
00:58:05,958 --> 00:58:08,166
but how are we gonna get there?

1138
00:58:08,250 --> 00:58:11,125
- We'd have to win the rest of our games.
- That's right, Jason.

1139
00:58:11,208 --> 00:58:13,875
You guys know what Drew Brees does
after every game?

1140
00:58:14,916 --> 00:58:18,791
When everybody else has gone home,
Drew stays on the field,

1141
00:58:18,875 --> 00:58:21,250
and he runs through
the progressions in his head

1142
00:58:22,083 --> 00:58:23,916
to see what he could've done better.

1143
00:58:24,416 --> 00:58:26,625
That's what separates him from the rest.

1144
00:58:27,208 --> 00:58:29,000
That's how you become great.

1145
00:58:29,583 --> 00:58:30,958
You think we can beat 'em, Dad?

1146
00:58:31,625 --> 00:58:32,916
We're not only gonna beat 'em,

1147
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,583
we're gonna shut the scoreboard off.
How about that?

1148
00:58:35,666 --> 00:58:36,666
Yeah, boys.

1149
00:58:37,208 --> 00:58:38,291
[all] Yeah!

1150
00:58:39,416 --> 00:58:43,375
Last Saturday,
I saw a team get beat mentally!

1151
00:58:44,958 --> 00:58:46,000
I saw guys quitting!

1152
00:58:46,583 --> 00:58:48,958
I saw guys not at their physical best.

1153
00:58:49,041 --> 00:58:51,291
So how do we bring that to the next level?

1154
00:58:51,875 --> 00:58:52,916
I'll tell you how.

1155
00:58:54,083 --> 00:58:56,458
We start running laps. Go! [whistle blows]

1156
00:59:03,083 --> 00:59:07,791
He wasn't talking about me quitting
and not being my physical best, was he?

1157
00:59:08,666 --> 00:59:11,250
He wasn't,
but a couple of laps wouldn't hurt.

1158
00:59:17,208 --> 00:59:19,291
[inspiring music plays]

1159
00:59:21,458 --> 00:59:23,833
[whistle blows]

1160
00:59:28,833 --> 00:59:29,833
[whistle blows]

1161
00:59:29,916 --> 00:59:34,166
Let's go. Get in there. Get in there.
Line it up. Let's go. Who wants it now?

1162
00:59:34,250 --> 00:59:36,375
[whistle blows]

1163
00:59:36,916 --> 00:59:37,833
Yeah!

1164
00:59:37,916 --> 00:59:40,333
[Sean] Again! Harder!
You knock him in the dirt!

1165
00:59:41,541 --> 00:59:44,291
Paulie, put the pizza down.
That's not your physical best.

1166
00:59:44,375 --> 00:59:45,666
Listen up, guys.

1167
00:59:46,458 --> 00:59:49,875
We need to address our weakest link,
which is our kicking game.

1168
00:59:49,958 --> 00:59:52,750
- [Paulie] My butt hurts, man.
- It's because of Harlan's girlfriend.

1169
00:59:52,833 --> 00:59:54,208
She's not my girlfriend.

1170
00:59:54,291 --> 00:59:56,625
- Tell her not to come.
- You need to focus, man.

1171
00:59:56,708 --> 00:59:59,333
[kids shouting]

1172
00:59:59,416 --> 01:00:01,208
[Troy] Hey, hey, hey, cut it out.

1173
01:00:01,291 --> 01:00:05,375
Listen up. Harlan's your teammate. You're
all gonna go through the same thing,

1174
01:00:05,458 --> 01:00:08,458
so we need to help him
with his girlfriend problems.

1175
01:00:08,541 --> 01:00:12,333
Guys, she's not my girlfriend.
She doesn't even know I exist.

1176
01:00:12,416 --> 01:00:14,750
- Have you ever talked to this girl?
- [Harlan] I can't.

1177
01:00:14,833 --> 01:00:17,250
I dropped out of chorus
the first day she joined.

1178
01:00:17,333 --> 01:00:20,750
Aw, big loss.
Harlan's got the voice of an angel.

1179
01:00:20,833 --> 01:00:22,125
I say stay away from her.

1180
01:00:23,125 --> 01:00:24,965
- Oh God, not again.
- She'll break your heart.

1181
01:00:25,041 --> 01:00:27,666
- Next thing, she's seeing some busboy.
- Mitch.

1182
01:00:27,750 --> 01:00:30,310
- Then you're moving in with your mother.
- We talked about this.

1183
01:00:30,375 --> 01:00:32,916
- M-M-Mitch, stop.
- And this kid's gonna kick my ass?

1184
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:33,875
[Sean] Okay, Mitchell.

1185
01:00:33,958 --> 01:00:36,916
- 25 years old? H-How am I gonna fight him?
- [Sean] Mitch, shut up.

1186
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:40,416
I've got a bad hip and a back made
out of saltines, for crying out loud.

1187
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:41,500
Hey!

1188
01:00:41,958 --> 01:00:45,708
Hey, Mitch, chill, man.
I'm setting you up with my twin sister.

1189
01:00:45,791 --> 01:00:48,000
Guys, look, Harlan's our teammate, okay?

1190
01:00:48,083 --> 01:00:50,083
He's got a problem.
We need to help him solve it.

1191
01:00:50,666 --> 01:00:53,291
I mean, my mom likes it
when I make her breakfast in the morning.

1192
01:00:53,375 --> 01:00:54,500
Make her breakfast.

1193
01:00:54,583 --> 01:00:57,916
- I don't even know how to cook.
- But you do know how to sing.

1194
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:01,791
Trust me, this is gonna work.
Ladies, they love the lanterns.

1195
01:01:01,875 --> 01:01:04,041
[chuckles] Had these left over
from my third wedding.

1196
01:01:06,750 --> 01:01:08,583
Ah, I always have problems.

1197
01:01:10,125 --> 01:01:11,625

It's across the street.

- How are you gonna get to work tomorrow?
- I won't. I'll be fired, but I'll be okay.

1232
01:03:12,125 --> 01:03:14,541
Well, at least she knows who you are now.

1233

- [boy 1] Yeah, boys.
- [boy 2] Yeah, yeah.

1235
01:03:19,291 --> 01:03:22,708
There is excitement
in Argyle, Texas, today, boys.

1236
01:03:23,333 --> 01:03:25,708
- Gentlemen. Amazing news.
- Hey, Jamie.

1237
01:03:25,791 --> 01:03:27,511
Since I got fired
from the health food store

1238
01:03:27,541 --> 01:03:29,083
for letting the cat sleep in the kale,

1239
01:03:29,166 --> 01:03:31,208
I've been in the kitchen,
your old kitchen,

1240
01:03:31,291 --> 01:03:33,583
perfecting my recipe
for the ultimate energy bar.

1241
01:03:33,666 --> 01:03:35,583
- Okay.
- And today, I finally succeeded.

1242
01:03:35,666 --> 01:03:39,291
Gentlemen, may I present to you
the Super Log.

1243
01:03:39,916 --> 01:03:42,833
- Okay, great. Thank you.
- You mind if I hand 'em out to the boys?

1244
01:03:42,916 --> 01:03:44,000
Great, Jamie. Go ahead.

1245

Hey, listen, guys. Wake up!
Come on over here. Everybody. Let's go.

Come on.

1247
01:03:48,833 --> 01:03:50,583
Now, we are one game away.

1248
01:03:51,375 --> 01:03:53,500
One game away from the championship.

1249
01:03:53,583 --> 01:03:55,916
I can't go out there and win it for you.

1250

has to do your job.

Do your job and have fun.

Grab one, a Super Log.

1254
01:04:12,833 --> 01:04:15,583
Uh, do you think I'll get in today, Coach?

1255
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:19,833
- Let me talk to Coach Payton about it.
- Okay.

1256
01:04:19,916 --> 01:04:20,916

I-I'm coaching my son's team,

I've never seen before.

Okay, what's it look like?

1310

For the life of me, I can't figure it out.

Easy. Take your wide receivers
and make them linebackers.

- Okay.
- [coach] <i>This is not about skill set.</i>

<i>It's about speed.</i>

do not tell anybody that I helped you.

01:09:15,708 --> 01:09:19,125
Remember the feeling you had
after we lost to these guys.

1338
01:09:20,791 --> 01:09:23,250
A lot of times,
we don't get a shot at redemption.

1339
01:09:24,166 --> 01:09:26,125
In the NFL, you lose to a team,

1340
01:09:26,208 --> 01:09:28,166
you may not see them
for the rest of the season.

1341
01:09:28,250 --> 01:09:30,541
You gotta carry that feeling
for another year.

1342
01:09:31,291 --> 01:09:32,791
You guys earned this,

1343
01:09:33,375 --> 01:09:36,833
and tonight we get to put that right
by showing them exactly who we are.

1344
01:09:37,416 --> 01:09:38,416
Now, who are we?

1345
01:09:38,458 --> 01:09:41,000
[all] Warriors!

1346
01:09:41,083 --> 01:09:42,958
[Sean] Now, let's
shut that scoreboard down.

1347
01:09:43,041 --> 01:09:45,666
- Let's go, boys. Game time!
- Get in there! Let's go!

1348
01:09:45,750 --> 01:09:48,250
That got me. That got me.

1349
01:09:48,333 --> 01:09:49,500
Uh, hey, uh,

1350
01:09:50,458 --> 01:09:52,541
do you think Harlan could play tonight?

1351
01:09:52,625 --> 01:09:54,958
- What?
- Well, he hasn't played in a while.

1352
01:09:55,583 --> 01:09:58,666
I understand he's your bud and all,
but, uh, no, he-he sits.

1353
01:10:02,083 --> 01:10:03,541
[Daryl] I got you, Payton!

1354
01:10:03,625 --> 01:10:04,875
We about to eat!

1355
01:10:05,458 --> 01:10:07,916
We about to eat good too! [laughs]

1356
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:11,416
Y'all ready? Y'all ready?
Let's do this! Let's do this! Come on!

1357
01:10:11,500 --> 01:10:13,083
[dramatic music plays]

1358
01:10:18,458 --> 01:10:19,458
[grunting]

1359
01:10:22,166 --> 01:10:24,041
[whistle blows]

1360
01:10:24,125 --> 01:10:27,416
[crowd cheers]

1361
01:10:28,916 --> 01:10:31,833
Here we go. Here we go.
Here we go. Get that ball.

1362
01:10:31,916 --> 01:10:32,958
[panting]

1363
01:10:33,708 --> 01:10:34,541
[grunting]

1364
01:10:34,625 --> 01:10:36,291
Marcos Gutierrez to return.

1365
01:10:36,375 --> 01:10:37,875
- Come on!
- Run it! Run it!

1366
01:10:37,958 --> 01:10:39,208
[grunting]

1367
01:10:39,291 --> 01:10:40,916
[Sean] Yes! Yes!

1368
01:10:41,416 --> 01:10:43,166
Hey! Hey!

1369
01:10:43,250 --> 01:10:45,166
Here we go! Here we go!

1370
01:10:45,250 --> 01:10:46,250
[commentator] <i>To the 30.</i>

1371
01:10:46,333 --> 01:10:47,500
<i>- To the 20.</i>
- Go!

1372
01:10:47,583 --> 01:10:48,583
To the ten!

1373
01:10:48,625 --> 01:10:49,708
[panting]

1374
01:10:49,791 --> 01:10:51,833
[dramatic music continues]

1375
01:10:52,750 --> 01:10:55,083
- [commentator] <i>Touchdown, Warriors!</i>
- Woo!

1376
01:10:55,166 --> 01:10:57,208
Let's go! Yeah! Let's go. Come on!

1377
01:10:57,291 --> 01:11:00,125
What a tremendous open for the Warriors.

1378
01:11:00,208 --> 01:11:02,708
Okay! Okay. Okay, Payton!

1379
01:11:03,416 --> 01:11:06,958
All right! Let's go, defense! D-D-D!

1380
01:11:07,041 --> 01:11:08,791
Hey! That's what I'm talking about.

1381
01:11:08,875 --> 01:11:11,166
Get in there.
Way to go, guys. Get it done.

1382
01:11:11,250 --> 01:11:12,291
Here, listen up.

1383
01:11:12,375 --> 01:11:15,250
Okay, when we get out there,
we're gonna be in a 3-4.

1384
01:11:15,333 --> 01:11:17,041
But, Jason, I had an idea for you.

1385
01:11:17,125 --> 01:11:18,666
I know how to attack this offense.

1386
01:11:18,750 --> 01:11:21,958
Okay? What they're running
is called a "single wing." And we gotta...

1387
01:11:22,041 --> 01:11:23,666
Aren't you running the offense now?

1388
01:11:23,750 --> 01:11:25,291
I can do both. Here's the deal.

1389
01:11:25,375 --> 01:11:28,083
To beat the single wing,
we gotta do this with speed.

1390
01:11:28,166 --> 01:11:31,208
We're gonna take our two fastest players,
Connor and Marcos,

1391
01:11:31,291 --> 01:11:33,184
and we're gonna put you guys
as defensive ends...

1392
01:11:33,208 --> 01:11:35,666
Uh, uh, I thought
I was the defensive lineb...

1393
01:11:35,750 --> 01:11:38,875
[Sean] You were. Okay? You're not now.
We gotta be able to adjust, okay?

1394
01:11:38,958 --> 01:11:41,059
- When did you come up with this?
- [Sean] Last night.

1395
01:11:41,083 --> 01:11:44,333
By myself. Layin' on my bed
in a crappy hotel, drinkin' a scotch.

1396
01:11:44,416 --> 01:11:45,791
Okay, here it is.

1397
01:11:45,875 --> 01:11:50,083
Defensive ends, we're gonna send them all
with speed, speed, speed, okay? Let's go.

1398
01:11:50,166 --> 01:11:51,291
Get it done.

1399
01:11:51,375 --> 01:11:54,875
- So we're not on D anymore?
- I don't know what we're doing.

1400
01:11:54,958 --> 01:11:57,875
Don't you think you have your hands full
with the offense?

1401
01:11:57,958 --> 01:12:00,875
Listen, this game is gonna be
either won or lost by defense.

1402
01:12:00,958 --> 01:12:03,416
But I don't know how I feel
about sitting so many guys.

1403
01:12:03,500 --> 01:12:04,958
I know exactly how I feel.

1404
01:12:05,041 --> 01:12:07,000
[tense music plays]

1405
01:12:07,083 --> 01:12:08,291

[tense music continues]

1407
01:12:11,583 --> 01:12:13,333
Hey, what's goin' on?

1408
01:12:15,875 --> 01:12:16,875
[boy] Hike!

1409
01:12:17,250 --> 01:12:18,250

[grunting]

1411
01:12:21,791 --> 01:12:24,000
That's my boy! Okay, get 'em, okay!

1412
01:12:24,791 --> 01:12:25,666
Yeah!

1413
01:12:25,750 --> 01:12:28,041
Oh, so you wanna make adjustments?

1414
01:12:28,125 --> 01:12:29,208
I can adjust too.

1415
01:12:29,291 --> 01:12:31,083
I'm an adjustable chair, baby.

1416
01:12:31,166 --> 01:12:34,041
I'mma pull it back on you.
I'm reclining on you.

1417
01:12:34,125 --> 01:12:36,000
You ain't never seen a La-Z-Boy like this.

1418
01:12:36,083 --> 01:12:37,000
[whistle blows]

1419
01:12:37,083 --> 01:12:38,666

- [boy] Hut!

[tense music continues]

1423
01:12:46,375 --> 01:12:47,375
[Daryl groans]

1424
01:12:47,458 --> 01:12:48,458
Yeah!

1425
01:12:49,500 --> 01:12:51,980
- [referee] Warrior ball!
<i>- </i>[commentator] <i>And Warriors recover!</i>

1426
01:12:52,500 --> 01:12:54,500
- That's right!
- That's how you play football!

1427
01:12:54,583 --> 01:12:55,875
- Yeah, Connor!
- Yes!

1428
01:12:56,833 --> 01:12:57,958
You seeing this, Ronald?

1429
01:12:58,041 --> 01:12:59,791
All right, good stuff, team. Good stuff!

1430
01:12:59,875 --> 01:13:03,166
There you guys go. Way to go.
What are you guys doing? Get out there.

1431
01:13:03,250 --> 01:13:05,041
Wait, Marcos and I are on offense too?

1432
01:13:05,125 --> 01:13:07,666
Yeah, offense and defense.
Let's go. Come on.

1433
01:13:12,666 --> 01:13:14,666
All right, everyone! Let's go! Let's go!

1434

They can't hold him! They can't hold him!

Yes! You can't coach speed.

1470
01:14:48,958 --> 01:14:51,666
You got all of halftime
to think about that one, Sean.

1471
01:14:51,750 --> 01:14:53,291
[Daryl laughs]

Warriors lead 18 to 17.

1476
01:15:01,916 --> 01:15:05,333
Ronald is already celebrating
with his lucky halftime pickle.

1477
01:15:10,416 --> 01:15:11,791
[Sean] We're looking good.

1478
01:15:11,875 --> 01:15:14,208
You can be sure
they're gonna make adjustments.

1479
01:15:14,291 --> 01:15:16,416
So we need to be ready.

1480
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:20,000
- I'm tired, Coach.
- That happens when you put the work in.

1481
01:15:20,083 --> 01:15:23,083
- You're gonna get tired. Suck it up.
- I'm exhausted too, Dad.

1482
01:15:23,708 --> 01:15:25,748
Why can't Nate and Jason
get back on defense, Coach?

1483
01:15:25,791 --> 01:15:28,958
'Cause sometimes you need to sacrifice
for the good of the team, Dennis.

1484
01:15:29,041 --> 01:15:30,750
[scoffs] Yeah, right.

1485
01:15:31,833 --> 01:15:32,833
I'm sorry?

1486
01:15:32,875 --> 01:15:36,541
You never sacrifice for anyone.
You make everyone else sacrifice for you.

1487
01:15:39,166 --> 01:15:42,000
Settle down there, son.
Listen, Brian. I want you to...

1488
01:15:42,083 --> 01:15:43,375
You're yelling at everybody

1489
01:15:43,458 --> 01:15:45,583
and won't let anybody listen
to Coach Troy.

1490
01:15:46,125 --> 01:15:49,875
- You haven't let Harlan play in weeks.
- [Sean] I'm trying to win a championship.

1491
01:15:49,958 --> 01:15:51,333
Just so you don't look bad.

1492
01:15:52,083 --> 01:15:55,583
Ever since you got embarrassed on ESPN,
you've been riding all of us.

1493
01:15:55,666 --> 01:15:59,291
- I thought this was supposed to be fun.
- W-Was it fun losin' every week?

1494
01:15:59,375 --> 01:16:00,666
Was that fun?

1495
01:16:00,750 --> 01:16:02,416
It was more fun than this.

1496
01:16:02,500 --> 01:16:05,958
Hey, if you're not having fun,
you're welcome to ride the bench. Okay?

1497
01:16:07,250 --> 01:16:11,250
So you're just gonna bench the whole team
then? What is your problem?

1498
01:16:11,333 --> 01:16:13,083
I am here trying to make this work!

1499
01:16:16,250 --> 01:16:17,500
[breathes deeply]

1500
01:16:18,041 --> 01:16:20,166

Uh, yeah. What gave it away?
The, uh, "take care" or the bag?

1669
01:26:01,416 --> 01:26:04,250
Well, I hope
you enjoyed your stay here, and...

1670
01:26:04,333 --> 01:26:06,791
Oh, wait. You gotta see this.

1671
01:26:07,541 --> 01:26:08,625
Look, it's a boy!

1672
01:26:09,291 --> 01:26:12,166
Whoa. Is... is that mid-birth?

1673
01:26:12,250 --> 01:26:15,208
Isn't it beautiful?
That's his little head poking out.

1674
01:26:15,291 --> 01:26:17,250
Wow. He... he looks just like you.

1675
01:26:17,333 --> 01:26:21,166
Your wife might not appreciate you
showing that picture to a lot of people.

1676
01:26:23,083 --> 01:26:24,250
Oh crap.

1677
01:26:27,750 --> 01:26:30,541
[Sean] Gotta say I was really impressed
with your speed this season.

1678
01:26:30,625 --> 01:26:34,208
- Guessing you get that from your old man.
- [Connor] Oh, definitely not.

1679
01:26:34,791 --> 01:26:36,125
I think I get that from Mom.

1680
01:26:36,625 --> 01:26:40,125
[chuckles] I get the soft hands from
Jamie. He makes his own lavender soap.

1681
01:26:40,208 --> 01:26:41,666
[laughing] Of course he does.

1682
01:26:44,208 --> 01:26:45,583
Hey, I wanted to thank you.

1683
01:26:47,250 --> 01:26:48,250
For what?

1684
01:26:48,583 --> 01:26:50,416
[Sean] Well, I wanted you to know that

1685
01:26:50,916 --> 01:26:52,791
I-I needed you and the...

1686
01:26:54,125 --> 01:26:56,250
and the team more than you guys needed me.

1687
01:26:58,250 --> 01:26:59,250
Yeah, you did.

1688
01:27:04,375 --> 01:27:05,583
I was talking to your mom.

1689
01:27:05,666 --> 01:27:08,583
Thought maybe you comin' out
to New Orleans for some visits this year.

1690
01:27:08,666 --> 01:27:10,375
- What do you think of that?
- For sure.

1691
01:27:10,458 --> 01:27:13,250
- Okay.
- That'd be really fun. I'd love that.

1692
01:27:13,333 --> 01:27:14,583
- All right.
- [both chuckle]

1693
01:27:15,083 --> 01:27:16,166
Can I go to games?

1694
01:27:16,250 --> 01:27:19,500
That's what you're coming out there for.
You're not stayin' in my house!

1695
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,351
- You think I can meet Drew?
- Nah, he don't wanna meet you.

1696
01:27:22,375 --> 01:27:25,833
[Connor laughs]

1697
01:27:27,958 --> 01:27:29,333
We'll have some fun.

1698
01:27:30,166 --> 01:27:32,791
- [Sean] I love you, Connor.
- [Connor] I love you too, Dad.

1699
01:27:32,875 --> 01:27:34,875
[uplifting music plays]

1700
01:27:35,875 --> 01:27:38,458
I'm gonna need a scouting report
on every RB in the draft.

1701
01:27:38,541 --> 01:27:41,375
And RB is Russell brouts?

1702
01:27:41,875 --> 01:27:45,333
No, a running back,
and that's not how you say that vegetable.

1703
01:27:45,416 --> 01:27:48,791
Oh. A-And we get
these scouting reports from...

1704
01:27:48,875 --> 01:27:50,115
[Sean] The scouting department.

1705
01:27:51,083 --> 01:27:54,666
Wow! You're a lot more patient with me
after working with kids for a year.

1706
01:27:54,750 --> 01:27:56,625
Yeah. Enjoy it while it lasts, Emma.

1707
01:28:00,625 --> 01:28:02,875
- Lionel!
- Coach!

1708
01:28:02,958 --> 01:28:05,000
- Good to have you back.
- It's good to be back.

1709
01:28:05,083 --> 01:28:06,416
[Lionel] I missed you so much.

1710
01:28:06,500 --> 01:28:07,916
Ah, I missed you too.

1711
01:28:11,333 --> 01:28:12,750
We really suck without you.

1712
