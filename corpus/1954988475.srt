No.

gained like six pounds,

massive breakouts.

putting his dick in a wrapper;

He's not returning
my texts or anything.

I'm thinking about showing
him and getting pregnant.

Of course if I get pregnant
I can't go to FATI.

726
00:47:58,776 --> 00:48:01,512
Do you think it would be okay
if maybe I spent the night,

00:48:01,546 --> 00:48:03,614
Tonight?

728
00:48:03,648 --> 00:48:07,352
Remember, when you invited me?

We can watch something
else if you want.

No, no, no... it's okay.

I didn't know I
had to watch Kera.

Me and Carl are going to hot
tub if no one's in there.

No, these are mine,
I gave you money.

you want to play me.

take your thingie out first,

clean me up?

I have waited this long.

I go by the name of 'Mom'.

I came here to tell
you that hmm, hmm,

What?

766
00:50:50,215 --> 00:50:52,117
But we have not told her yet,

767

I don't want to upset her.

be very, very hard for you

But this is a family emergency,
we do need you at home,

And I thought that you might,

772

Maybe would like to see your
grandmother before she passes.

I will... I will ask
for some time off.

someone's been stealing

Ah!

about to pay for it.

00:57:48,533 --> 00:57:50,668
Just minutes every day...

903
00:57:56,907 --> 00:57:58,509
Okay. All right!

904
00:57:58,543 --> 00:58:02,680
Slow down grandma,
I don't want you to choke.

905
00:58:02,713 --> 00:58:05,850
You're a pitiful
Pocahontas, you know that?

906
00:58:05,883 --> 00:58:08,519
What kind of a moronic
dope wastes her life

907
00:58:08,553 --> 00:58:09,820
Getting stuck on
her mom's house

908
00:58:09,854 --> 00:58:12,523
Wiping her old
mama's poop shoot?

909
00:58:12,557 --> 00:58:16,226
Do something with
yourself for pity's sakes.

910
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:18,863
I want to be here
for you grandma.

911
00:58:18,896 --> 00:58:22,366
Honey, let grandma eat in peace,

912
00:58:22,399 --> 00:58:23,534
Besides I could use some help

913
00:58:23,568 --> 00:58:25,870
Acting out the Iran
hostage crisis,

914
00:58:25,903 --> 00:58:30,040
Really could.

915
00:58:30,941 --> 00:58:32,910
* Uh-oh uh-oh here
comes tomorrow

916
00:58:32,943 --> 00:58:37,582
* Uh-oh uh-oh what
will we borrow now

917
00:58:37,615 --> 00:58:40,184
* And pay back somehow

918
00:58:40,217 --> 00:58:43,621
* Whoa...

919
00:58:43,654 --> 00:58:46,724
* This is the
Pilgrim's progress

920
00:58:46,757 --> 00:58:50,360
* That ain't no
time to rest.

921
00:58:50,394 --> 00:58:52,930
* So get up out
of your bed

922
00:58:52,963 --> 00:58:56,300
* Whoa...

923
00:58:56,333 --> 00:58:59,403
* Shake off fall
on your head

924
00:58:59,436 --> 00:59:04,141
* Shake off fall
on your head

925
00:59:04,174 --> 00:59:07,444
* Whoa oh...

926
00:59:07,477 --> 00:59:11,248
* We've got things
that we got to do

927
00:59:11,281 --> 00:59:16,553
* You've got people who
are counting on you

928
00:59:16,587 --> 00:59:20,524
* Counting on you

929
00:59:20,557 --> 00:59:23,460
* Uh-oh uh-oh here
come's tomorrow

930
00:59:23,493 --> 00:59:25,162
* Uh-oh uh-oh...

931
00:59:25,195 --> 00:59:27,898
Why did you take down
the Lisbon Lace number?

932
00:59:27,932 --> 00:59:29,634
Oh, I sold it.

933
00:59:29,667 --> 00:59:31,435
For the full sale price?

934
00:59:31,468 --> 00:59:32,903
Uh-huh.

935
00:59:32,937 --> 00:59:36,941
Well, it's not even
winter ball season.

936
00:59:36,974 --> 00:59:38,042
Michael Paul,

937
00:59:38,075 --> 00:59:39,476
Could you write me a
recommendation for something?

938
00:59:39,509 --> 00:59:40,711
Uh-huh.

939
00:59:40,745 --> 00:59:41,846
And if I sell my own designs,

940
00:59:41,879 --> 00:59:45,415
Will I get to keep
the money from that?

941
00:59:45,449 --> 00:59:49,219
* We've got things
that we got to do

942
00:59:49,253 --> 00:59:54,591
* You've got people who
are counting on you

943
00:59:54,625 --> 00:59:57,728
* Counting on you

944
00:59:57,762 --> 01:00:01,899
* We've got things
that we got to do

945
01:00:01,932 --> 01:00:07,271
* You've got people who
are counting on you

946
01:00:07,304 --> 01:00:08,873
* Counting on you

947
01:00:08,906 --> 01:00:10,941
Oh my God!

948
01:00:10,975 --> 01:00:11,942
So cute!

949
01:00:11,976 --> 01:00:14,411
I know, really, look at it.

950
01:00:14,444 --> 01:00:19,016
Oh my God! It looks so good!

951
01:00:19,049 --> 01:00:20,885
[Laughter]

952
01:00:20,918 --> 01:00:23,654
Oh my God!
This is like romantical.

953
01:00:23,688 --> 01:00:27,658
* We've got things
that we got to do

954
01:00:27,692 --> 01:00:32,797
* You've got people who
are counting on you

955
01:00:32,830 --> 01:00:36,166
* Counting on you

956
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:40,204
* We've got things
that we got to do

957
01:00:40,237 --> 01:00:45,642
* You've got people who
are counting on you

958
01:00:45,676 --> 01:00:49,379
* Counting on you

959
01:01:06,130 --> 01:01:09,934
Did you try paying
the bill, Mom?

960
01:01:09,967 --> 01:01:12,502
Can I borrow the
car tomorrow?

961
01:01:12,536 --> 01:01:13,704
But you don't work
on Saturday.

962
01:01:13,738 --> 01:01:15,305
Michael Paul needs me.

963
01:01:15,339 --> 01:01:16,974
Well, why don't
I drop you off?

964
01:01:17,007 --> 01:01:18,843
We could stop at
the Jiffy Go,

965
01:01:18,876 --> 01:01:21,912
You know, like a
mom-daughter morning out.

966
01:01:21,946 --> 01:01:24,414
Why doesn't she pick up
the sedan from my place?

967
01:01:24,448 --> 01:01:28,318
Oh mother, that
car's a deathtrap.

968
01:01:33,190 --> 01:01:35,692
You want?

969
01:01:35,726 --> 01:01:38,028
It's yours.

970
01:01:38,062 --> 01:01:40,097
Like for keeps?

971
01:01:40,130 --> 01:01:41,565
Sure!

972
01:01:41,598 --> 01:01:43,968
What do I need it for?

973
01:01:47,371 --> 01:01:48,038
[Music]

974
01:01:48,072 --> 01:01:50,140
* Wish we could travel far

975
01:01:50,174 --> 01:01:52,309
* And drive the
length of a land...

976
01:01:55,780 --> 01:02:01,218
* Don't mind if we
have to live time to time

977
01:02:01,251 --> 01:02:05,189
* If you're with me

978
01:02:10,194 --> 01:02:16,500
* I don't mind living
poor for all my life

979
01:02:16,533 --> 01:02:19,336
* if you're with me

980
01:02:22,239 --> 01:02:23,941
Hello!

981
01:02:29,646 --> 01:02:32,382
It says there's
insufficient funds.

982
01:02:32,416 --> 01:02:33,483
Well, I know.

983
01:02:33,517 --> 01:02:36,921
That's why I'm
making a deposit.

984
01:02:36,954 --> 01:02:39,656
No ma'am, the
check's no good.

985
01:02:39,689 --> 01:02:40,457
What do you mean?

986
01:02:40,490 --> 01:02:43,060
It's my ex-husband's.

987
01:02:43,093 --> 01:02:45,495
He has an account
with this bank.

988
01:02:45,529 --> 01:02:49,366
There's not enough money
in his account to cover it.

989
01:02:49,399 --> 01:02:50,935
Are you sure?

990
01:02:50,968 --> 01:02:56,106
I'm looking at
the account now.

991
01:02:56,140 --> 01:02:57,842
Well, can you give
me what he has?

992
01:02:57,875 --> 01:02:59,844
That's not how it works.

993
01:02:59,877 --> 01:03:02,880
Just when were you
planning on telling me,

994
01:03:02,913 --> 01:03:05,082
Because a little warning
would have been nice?

995
01:03:05,115 --> 01:03:06,083
Well, what can
I tell you, June,

996
01:03:06,116 --> 01:03:07,918
People just
aren't buying cars.

997
01:03:07,952 --> 01:03:10,420
Tell her about the B&B.

998
01:03:10,454 --> 01:03:11,721
Here's the thing.

999
01:03:11,755 --> 01:03:14,324
Chip and I are thinking
about moving down to Baja

1000
01:03:14,358 --> 01:03:16,326
And opening a B&B.

1001
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:17,794
Uh, what?

1002
01:03:17,828 --> 01:03:19,529
Excuse me!

1003
01:03:19,563 --> 01:03:22,566
With what money,
and what about us?

1004
01:03:22,599 --> 01:03:24,268
What did that
moron do now?

1005
01:03:24,301 --> 01:03:25,135
Mother, please!

1006
01:03:25,169 --> 01:03:26,470
How many times do
I have to tell you,

1007
01:03:26,503 --> 01:03:29,874
Get off your ass, get a
job and get a fucking life.

1008
01:03:29,907 --> 01:03:33,777
I do have a life, Dale,

1009
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:35,279
It's a very rich life,

1010
01:03:35,312 --> 01:03:36,213
And I do have a job,

1011
01:03:36,246 --> 01:03:38,883
It's called
bringing up our children,

1012
01:03:38,916 --> 01:03:40,450
It's called sheltering them,

1013
01:03:40,484 --> 01:03:44,321
It's called protecting
them from cretins like you.

1014
01:03:44,354 --> 01:03:46,723
Oh lady, you are such
a fucking nightmare.

1015
01:03:46,756 --> 01:03:48,092
Well, maybe you should
have thought about that

1016
01:03:48,125 --> 01:03:49,960
Before you talked a
certain young woman

1017
01:03:49,994 --> 01:03:53,363
Into having unprotected
premarital relations.

1018
01:03:53,397 --> 01:03:54,531
Believe me, I do.

1019
01:03:54,564 --> 01:03:58,768
I think about it every
goddamn day of my fucking life.

1020
01:03:58,802 --> 01:03:59,436
It's enough.

1021
01:03:59,469 --> 01:04:00,004
Okay.

1022
01:04:00,037 --> 01:04:00,637
All right, fine, thanks.

1023
01:04:00,670 --> 01:04:03,107
Thank you!

1024
01:04:03,140 --> 01:04:07,344
June, your dog
just upchucked.

1025
01:04:12,349 --> 01:04:14,985
Oh,

1026
01:04:15,019 --> 01:04:18,588
You're here early.

1027
01:04:18,622 --> 01:04:20,190
Don't you have
community service?

1028
01:04:20,224 --> 01:04:20,925
It's finished.

1029
01:04:20,958 --> 01:04:24,494
I'm finished.

1030
01:04:24,528 --> 01:04:25,695
That's cool!

1031
01:04:25,729 --> 01:04:26,796
Yeah, yeah, it's cool!

1032
01:04:26,830 --> 01:04:28,565
So yeah, you know,

1033
01:04:28,598 --> 01:04:31,601
I'm probably going to
have to cut back your hours

1034
01:04:31,635 --> 01:04:33,237
A little bit.

1035
01:04:33,270 --> 01:04:36,740
To what?

1036
01:04:36,773 --> 01:04:39,910
Maybe none.

1037
01:04:39,944 --> 01:04:42,679
I mean, I mean, I realize
that we've been selling

1038
01:04:42,712 --> 01:04:44,248
Gobs of dresses,

1039
01:04:44,281 --> 01:04:47,817
But I just can't afford to have
you on the floor anymore, so...

1040
01:04:47,851 --> 01:04:49,319
What about my designs?

1041
01:04:49,353 --> 01:04:51,188
Well, you know, maybe Fashion
Cottage will want to buy them,

1042
01:04:51,221 --> 01:04:52,889
But I've just been getting
a lot of complaints

1043
01:04:52,923 --> 01:04:54,624
From some of our
older customers.

1044
01:04:54,658 --> 01:04:56,760
All they buy
are pantyhose.

1045
01:04:56,793 --> 01:04:57,694
Well, I guess,
some people are

1046
01:04:57,727 --> 01:05:00,097
Just really
bad with change.

1047
01:05:10,207 --> 01:05:14,078
And then the
FBI unsuccessfully

1048
01:05:14,111 --> 01:05:17,381
Attempted to negotiate.

1049
01:05:17,414 --> 01:05:20,050
Sweetheart, what
are you doing home?

1050
01:05:20,084 --> 01:05:22,286
I want to kill myself.

1051
01:05:22,319 --> 01:05:26,923
That's exactly what the
Branch Davidians said.

1052
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:44,574
It's supposed
to be right there,

1053
01:05:44,608 --> 01:05:47,544
But I don't understand
what's happening to textbooks.

1054
01:05:50,580 --> 01:05:54,184
Well, I'm sorry, but
since your deadbeat dad

1055
01:05:54,218 --> 01:05:57,988
Decided to skip out on
his support obligations,

1056
01:05:58,022 --> 01:05:59,723
We all need to contribute.

1057
01:05:59,756 --> 01:06:00,991
You stole my money.

1058
01:06:01,025 --> 01:06:04,561
I did not; I borrowed it.

1059
01:06:04,594 --> 01:06:10,134
Jesus June!

1060
01:06:10,167 --> 01:06:14,571
Well, how do you think that I
make ends meet with your father

1061
01:06:14,604 --> 01:06:17,407
Gallivanting off to Mexico?

1062
01:06:17,441 --> 01:06:19,976
I mean, how do you think
we put food on the table

1063
01:06:20,010 --> 01:06:22,112
And have a roof
over our heads?

1064
01:06:22,146 --> 01:06:23,180
What about grandma?

1065
01:06:23,213 --> 01:06:24,748
Why can't you ask
grandma for help?

1066
01:06:24,781 --> 01:06:28,518
No, no, I will not go
crawling back to that woman

1067
01:06:28,552 --> 01:06:31,588
With my hand out,
not in million years.

1068
01:06:31,621 --> 01:06:34,624
But it's okay to steal
from your daughter.

1069
01:06:34,658 --> 01:06:36,926
It's not like she is even going
to be here for much longer.

1070
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:37,761
Who?

1071
01:06:37,794 --> 01:06:39,196
What?

1072
01:06:39,229 --> 01:06:40,730
Who?

1073
01:06:44,268 --> 01:06:46,103
I'm so sorry, grandma.

1074
01:06:46,136 --> 01:06:49,339
No one wanted to tell
you, but you're dying.

1075
01:06:49,373 --> 01:06:52,242
I'm sorry.

1076
01:06:52,909 --> 01:06:54,211
Ah!

1077
01:06:54,244 --> 01:06:57,914
Right, fine, mother,

Hey Fonzie, come here and
help your grandma for a minute.

1259
01:20:07,236 --> 01:20:09,906
I'm going to eat
before I go to grandma.

1260
01:20:09,939 --> 01:20:12,541
Give me a second already.

1261
01:20:12,575 --> 01:20:13,542
Coming!

1262
01:20:15,578 --> 01:20:17,446
Good girl!

1263
01:20:22,318 --> 01:20:23,452
Hurry up, take this.

1264
01:20:23,486 --> 01:20:24,020
Oh my God!

1265
01:20:24,053 --> 01:20:25,254
No, grandma, I can't.

1266
01:20:25,288 --> 01:20:26,689
It's yours,
I want you to have it.

1267
01:20:26,722 --> 01:20:27,991
It's for you.

1268
01:20:28,024 --> 01:20:29,725
Better you than your mother.

1269
01:20:29,758 --> 01:20:31,027
Okay, that was mean.

1270
01:20:31,060 --> 01:20:32,828
She's going to be fine.

1271
01:20:32,862 --> 01:20:36,933
This is for you.

1272
01:20:44,607 --> 01:20:46,175
Go buy yourself
something pretty.

1273
01:20:46,209 --> 01:20:47,710
Jesus Christ!

1274
01:20:47,743 --> 01:20:51,180
Talk about
needing fashion school.

1275
01:20:57,220 --> 01:20:58,187
Hey, ass-wipe,

1276
01:20:58,221 --> 01:21:00,623
All the emo freaks
belong on the bleachers.

1277
01:21:00,656 --> 01:21:02,258
Go!

1278
01:21:02,291 --> 01:21:03,326
What?

1279
01:21:03,359 --> 01:21:06,062
What?

1280
01:21:16,339 --> 01:21:18,274
You have the
baloney sandwiches?

1281
01:21:18,307 --> 01:21:19,475
Yeah.

1282
01:21:19,508 --> 01:21:23,312
I made them with one slice
each just like you like them.

1283
01:21:23,346 --> 01:21:26,615
Thank you!

1284
01:21:26,649 --> 01:21:30,753
Oh, remember to fill up when
you reach a quarter of a tank,

1285
01:21:30,786 --> 01:21:31,287
Okay?

1286
01:21:31,320 --> 01:21:32,655
No less.

1287
01:21:32,688 --> 01:21:34,423
All right, I will!

1288
01:21:34,457 --> 01:21:36,159
And lock your doors
while you're driving,

1289
01:21:36,192 --> 01:21:37,693
Because there is no
telling what kind of hustlers

1290
01:21:37,726 --> 01:21:38,761
Can come up to your car.

1291
01:21:38,794 --> 01:21:40,529
Okay.

1292
01:21:47,803 --> 01:21:54,277
Well, I guess this is it then.

1293
01:21:54,310 --> 01:21:57,246
I think so.

1294
01:22:03,719 --> 01:22:05,654
Okay, mom,

1295
01:22:09,158 --> 01:22:13,462
I'm going to be okay.

1296
01:22:13,496 --> 01:22:15,331
I know you will.

1297
01:22:15,364 --> 01:22:20,036
And you'll be too.

1298
01:22:20,069 --> 01:22:22,705
I hope you know how
much I appreciate this.

1299
01:22:22,738 --> 01:22:23,506
I mean, I'm going to do it...

1300
01:22:23,539 --> 01:22:24,873
All right, all right,

1301
01:22:24,907 --> 01:22:29,178
Stop it before I change my mind.

1302
01:22:44,893 --> 01:22:47,730
I love you mom!

1303
01:22:50,466 --> 01:22:59,975
