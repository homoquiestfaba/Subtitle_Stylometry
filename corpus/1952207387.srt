  

1
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,074
Hey DeVivo, in my office.

2
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,755
How's your mother doing?
- It's OK with her.

3
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,516
They were married for 52 years.
It's the first time she's ever been alone.

4
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,433
How are you, how's the casload?
- Good.

5
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,592
Most of my cases were diverted
while I was on leave.

6
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,832
What's this?

7
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,239
I'm the assistant D.A. Can you
deal with that in a hurry?  

10 
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,474 
Umm, well I must have died 
and gone to Heaven.  

11 
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:34,438 
Still looks like Hell to me, sarge.  

12 
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:40,155 
911 Logs on... 
November 23rd and 24th.  

13 
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:45,792 
Anything else to waste my time with?  
-Yeah, Shapiro's death announcement.  

14 
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,110 
Thank you very much.  

16 
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:26,038 
Who was he to you?  
-I don't understand.  

17 
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,431 
How did you know him?  
-As a friend.  

18 
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,875 
He was also a client of 
yours for 6 years.  

19 
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:36,556 
Well, people come to this program 
to get help living with disease.  

20 
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,190 
This is our holistic services unit.  
-Is this where you met him?  

21 
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:44,512 
He was an artist... a musician.  
He played in my home town.  

22 
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:05,672 
Matt was actually the first real
New Yorker that I'd ever met.  

23 
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,913 
This is your co-pilot speaking.  
We apologise for the further delay.  

24 
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,993 
We finally have our 
last passenger on board.  

25 
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:20,633 
We will soon be deparing, but we've lost our 
position in the line up. Delay may be 2 minutes. 

26 
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,917 
Thank you for flying, and I hope 
you enjoy your flight.
  

27 
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:40,350 
Lady,I hope you have flight insurance 'cos this 
instrument is worth at least 6 times what you are.  

28 
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:46,834 
And that's a conservative estimate. If this 
plane goes down, I'll save it before you!  

29 
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,719 
Don't shake your hand at me.  

30 
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:26,468 
Is that pot?  -Yeah. 
Who'd you think was gonna blow you? 

31 
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,989 
By the way, my name's Matt.  

32 
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:56,436 
I rented a car. I didn't have 
any money or a license.  

33 
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,352 
Sounds charming.  

34 
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,880 
It wasn't always such a .....  

35 
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,588 
I think it's time we started a new regimen 
of Protease inhibitors right away.  

36 
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,877 
Great. How many pills this time?  
-Actually, it's a lot less.  

37 
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:17,113 
It's only ten, taken three times a day.  
- Side effects are?  

38 
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,317 
The usual, nausea, skin rashes, diarhoea...  

39 
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:28,194 
and this particular regimen can also cause 
dementia,hallucinations and severe headaches.  

40 
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:38,596 
Matt, I have to be honest with you. 
There are only two newer protocols left to try.  

41 
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:43,311 
I think it might be time to speak 
with your family about this now.   

42 
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:46,074 
I'm dieing. I'm dieing.  

43 
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:51,553 
Matt, these medicines were 
designed to prolong life.  

44 
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:56,236 
And they've worked for you, but they 
were never meant to be a cure.  

45 
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,710 
Well ..... thank you.  

46 
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,759 
Out withthe old, in with the new.  

47 
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,876 
Brain tumors eventually killed Matt.  

48 
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:07,156 
Mr. Knight, three other patients have died 
rather suddenly in the six last months.  

49 
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:11,199 
Eddie Suarez, Terry Quinn, John Butta.  

50 
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,435 
All my patients die.  

51 
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:25,230 
The police are not investigating right now, but they reported to the District Attorney's office...  

52 
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:31,589
that autopsies revealed similar toxicology reports...
Dilaudid and morphine in the blood of two patients.  

53 
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,991 
Well, they all take similar medications.  

54 
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,628 
Such large quantities?  

55 
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:43,193 
These people suffer in ways we can't even imagine.  
The drugs are there to ease the pain... Excuse me.  

56 
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:51,355 
New applications for drugs assistance.  
These are Bobby Tella's ashes.  

57 
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:56,719 
His family never came to pick them up.  
You can add them to the collection.  

58 
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:04,197 
The Board of Health is coming this week, and since 
we are not ready I have sent a memo to all staff.  

8
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,999 
You know, clean up your paperwork... 
files off the floor...  

60 
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:11,073 
You know, what is wrong with these people?
And why can't they cut us some slack? 

61 
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:17,076 
We got a huge waiting list to get in here, and I got 
to worry about some anal retentive with a checklist?  

62 
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:38,552 
Sorry I have to ask you to do this for me...  
-Don't worry about it, mom.  

63 
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,554 
Your father was the handyman...
and I was the cook.  

64 
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:46,359 
Daddy - he could burn water.  

65 
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:51,640 
He made spaghetti only once. Two years later 
I was still cleaning up the sauce.  

66 
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:55,156 
Mom, how come the toilet blocks 
every time I flush??  

67 
00:10:55,320 --> 00:11:00,519 
Know how many rolls of toilet paper she has in there, Nick? Hundreds. Like she's stockpiling for a war. 

68 
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:06,550 
Your father ruined those pipes... 
A colon like an express train.  

69 
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,518 
Thank you, Nicky.  You too, Chris.  

70 
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,789 
Getting old SUCKS!

71 
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:38,550 
Is that her? ... Mr. Metzler, you called 911. 
Se we just have to do a follow up.  

72 
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:45,432 
The 911 log said that you were a woman. I'm concerned 
that an NYPD officer had such bad eyesight. 

73 
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:50,038 
Either you lied to them...
Or you lied to me.  

74 
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,317 
I'm very pissed off when I'm lied to.  

75 
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,795 
Would you like some water?  

76 
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:17,110 
The 911 report says there was some emergency.  

77 
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:21,239 
But then, the next day 
there was a dead body.  

78 
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:32,870 
Did you call 911?  
- Oh, I'm so sorry, there's been a mistake. 

79 
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:38,433 
There's no emergency. We were fighting 
My friend has been drinking.  

80 
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,909 
Are you gonna be okay, Ma'am?  

81 
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,438 
I am so sad.  

82 
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:51,077 
Get up, Rory.  Come on. Get up.  

83 
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,196 
He'd lost his breath, that's all.  
I never saw a dead body before.  

84 
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,909 
I thought when someone dies, you call 911.  

85 
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:08,709 
Rory, could you tell me who 
Mr Shapiro's next of kin is?  

86 
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:13,032 
Hi, I'm Nicole DeVivo, 
from the District Attorney's office.  

87 
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,636 
I'm looking for Mrs Lila Shapiro.  
Is she in?  -No.

88 
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,828 
Can I come in anyway?  
- No. 

89 
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,678 
What are your names?  
- Amelia.  

90 
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,398 
Lilian.  

91 
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,438 
Hi, Amelia.  Hi, Lilian.
- Hi.  

92 
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,749 
Can I come in?  
- Okay.  

93 
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:41,432 
That's really good.  
- Thank you.  

94 
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:50,194 
Amelia, Lilian, what have I told you?  
You don't let anyone in this house except me and Polly.  

95 
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,873 
Who are you?  

96 
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:55,794 
I'm Nicole DeVivo, from the 
Distict Attorney's office.  

97 
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,474 
I'm looking for Lila Shapiro.  

98 
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:04,875 
My mother is out of town.  
I'm house-sitting. Indefinitely.  

99 
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,235 
Something I can help you with?  

100 
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:10,278 
This concerns Matthew Shapiro' death.  

101 
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:13,989 
Did You know him?  
- I'm Mattie' sister.  

102 
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:18,711 
Mrs.... Ms Gabrielle Shapiro-Schnell.  

103 
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:23,469 
Were you with Matthew when he died?  
- I beg your pardon?  

104 
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:26,473 
There are some concerns 
surrounding Matthew's death.  

105 
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,597 
Matthew had Aids.  

106 
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,119 
Did he die from Aids?  

107 
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:42,875 
My brother was very sick and very depressed. So what 
that he took a handfull of pills and killed himself!  

108 
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:49,555 
All the terrorists in New York... 
You got nothing better to do?  

109 
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,439 
You push the green button, mom.
- Oh, great.  

110 
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,232 
You lied to me. I can't believe it.  
You effing lied to me.  

111 
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:12,997 
Oh, Hi Gaby.  
-You said he committed suicide.  

112 
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:17,631 
Okay, the cops have been.  

113 
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,758 
I have to go now.  
-Don't you dare hang up on me!  

114 
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,758 
Well, this looks like a good spot.  

115 
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:37,471 
You know, this is against Jewish law.  
- It's what he wanted, mom. You can't uncremate him now.   

116 
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,399 
Say goodbye to your brother.  

117 
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:48,869 
'Bye then, Mattie, Mattie. 
Go feed the fishes.  

118 
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:12,875 
Ugh, GROSS!!  
- He was always a messy kid!  

119 
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:17,115 
The Event

120 
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,676 
You want Sophie?

121 
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,958 
What are you doing here?  
- Having a party.  

122 
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,275 
You're a little late.  
- Yep?  

123 
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,954 
Well you... are fucked.  

124 
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:37,472 
It's weird being here without him.  
- Don't touch anything in the bedroom.  

125 
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:41,349 
Do you think Matt's gonna haunt this place, 
when the next tenant moves in?  

126 
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:45,399 
Only if they're straight.  
- Brian, why did we all leave in such a hurry?  

127 
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:50,953 
'Cos I'd a visit yesterday from the DA's office.  
They're looking into Mattie's death.  

128 
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,317 
I knew it, I knew it.  
Didn't I tell you, Judy? Didn't I?  

129 
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,950 
Well, at least Andy's not gonna say: 
"I told you so."  

130 
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:00,680 
Probably just a routine follow up.  

131 
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:04,833 
They don't know that any of you were here,  
so let's just keep it that way. - Damned right! 

132 
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,269 
There is one problem.  

133 
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:11,113 
Oh no.
- Lorna, let me finish.  

134 
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:15,319 
Gaby was here today.  
She knows about the party.  

135 
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:20,916 
This is everybody, right? 
- You're forgetting someone.  

136 
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:24,436 
Who?  
- Can I ask a question about the Village People.  

137 
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:28,070 
This is why I don't smoke.  

138 
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,198 
Oh my God, Rory...  What if he knows everything?  

139 
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:35,831 
Rory's a big mouth.  
- A huge mouth, especially when he drinks.  

140 
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,879 
We're dead.
How did America not know they were gay?  

141 
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:43,239 
They were gay,right?  

142 
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,994 
Actually, not all of them.  

143 
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,716 
MA!

144 
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:14,673 
Oh my God.
Boy, Amelia's handwriting is really improving.  

145 
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:21,070 
We have discovered three, er, other situations...  

146 
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,996 
that are very similar to Matthew's.  

147 
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,438 
I only know about my son.  

148 
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:36,833 
Mrs Shapiro, I know this 
is very hard for you.  

149 
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,992 
So I'll try to be brief.  

150 
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:43,357 
How long were you aware that Matt was sick?  

151 
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,117 
That stuffing was great!  

152 
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:51,431 
I think it was the fennel.  

153 
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,955 
You know fennel?  

154 
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:57,908 
Your Aunt Claire introduced me to fennel.  

155 
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:04,388 
Mom, I'm gay.  

156 
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,670 
I know.  

157 
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:11,150 
I've er, I've known for a long time.  

158 
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:17,077 
Gaby told me years ago.  
- What, she outed me?  

159 
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:22,234 
Well, the last girl you brought 
back was a Prom date.  

160 
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,914 
and you did her make up.  

161 
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:29,278 
My sex life is none of Gaby's business, mom.  

162 
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:34,389 
Gaby has very definite ideas like your father.  
God rest his soul.  

163 
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,596 
I love you.  

164 
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:47,638 
There's something else...  
-What?  What something else?  

165 
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:52,150 
I'm sick.  

166 
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:26,038 
I'm sorry, mom..  

167 
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:30,796 
No, no, Mattie.  No, no, no.  

168 
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,355 
Excuse me.  

169 
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:41,795 
So, was he really sick?  
- Oh, okay, let's see, um...  

170 
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:46,357 
Yeah, I guess things pretty 
much went downhill from there.

171 
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,800 
I have an audition..  
-Yeah? For what?  

172 00:22:55,960 --> 00:23:00,829 
A job, a commercial for a promising new feminine 
hygiene product. -- Is this important?  

173 
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,072 
I don't any money to lend you.
Go ask mom.  

174 
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,708 
I told her.  

175 
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,913 
What? That you're gay?  No.  

176 
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:18,109 
She cried, didn't she?
Oh my God, I can't believe that I messed up.  

177 
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,636 
Dana, I've got Aids.  

178 00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,709 
No, don't you say that again, you motherfucker.
   
179 
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:48,075 
Fucker, fucking stupid!  

180 
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,436 
Are You ready?  

181 
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,470 
Can I start in a minute??  

182 
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,835 
Okay, fine.  

183 
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,118 
Dana wants a minute.  
And action.  

184 
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,595 
When I get a yeast infection, 
I use Vagimar.  

185 
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:24,231 
It melts the itch away like butter.  
- Cut!.  

186 
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,755 
Margarine.  

187 
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:30,310 
Margarine?  What's the difference?  

188 
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:34,792 
It's my crotch. What? Am I gonna 
fry eggs down there or something?  

189 
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,555 
I'm sorry, who says margarine? 
Who says that?
  
190 
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:42,269 
Sorry, it just feels wrong..  

191 
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:47,798 
Okay, okay. No, no, I see that. I see where you're going. It's good... 
  
192 
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:50,918 
I'm glad that you're thinking. 
That you are getting inside the character there.  

193 
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:56,632 
A girl like this would probably say butter. But, er... 

194 
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:01,191 
I'm gonna ask you, this character in the world that we're 
creating here...  

195 
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:05,911 
She's only got one motivation, right?  
Got one thing on her mind...  

196 
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,152 
Spread Vagimar.  

197 
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:11,629 
Now, let me ask you this...  

198 
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:17,318 
Vagimar is called Vagimar because 
it melts like margarine.  

199 
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:21,996 
'Cos if it melted like butter, 
it would be called Vagibutt.

200 
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:26,278 
And Dana, how many women that you know
would pay nineteen dollars...  

201 
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:30,956 
To spread some yellow gluck 
called Vagibutt up their hole?  

202 
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,839 
Are we on the same page now?
Great.  

203 
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,833 
And action.  

204 
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,275 
When I get a yeast...   

205 
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,596 
When I get a yeast infection...  

206 
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:14,356 
When I get a yeast infection...  

207 
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:18,472 
That's beautiful, honey.  
That's gonna sell a lot of Vagimar.  

208 
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:24,268 
This isn't really helping me.  
I'm sorry to have bothered you.  

209 
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:30,630 
I don't know much about Aids, 
but I do know there's nothing more tragic...  

210 
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:33,519 
than when someone takes his own life.  

211 
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:38,515 
What you know about Aids,
could fit in my purse.  

212 
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,952 
Wait...  

213 
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,036 
Quickly, like bunniess.  

214 
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,116 
Nick DeVivo, District Attorney's
office, New York.  

215 
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:07,958 
Mom...  
-What?  

216 
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:10,315 
I'm cold.  

217 
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:21,632 
I was surprised to hear from you.  
- I'll bet you were.  

218 
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:26,635 
This won't take long. Since the game is over 
my ex istaking the girls to karate.  

219 
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:29,712 
Listen, I want you to stop bothering my family.  

220 
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:34,635 
Amelia, stop that. 
You stop stepping on your sister's head  Share!  

221 
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:42,749 
Listen, it's just a case to you.  
He was my baby brother.  

222 
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:46,196 
Did you know your brother was going to die?  

223 
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:53,755 
Where did you get these?  
- Keep your paws off my goods.  

224 
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:58,317 
So, what's it like to be a gay divorc?  

225 
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:03,349 
It was ten years of hard work.  
And what have I got to show for it? Nothing.  

226 
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:08,435 
No credit card, no house.  I live 
with my mother in New Jersey.  

227 
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:11,433 
You have got two beautiful kids   

228 
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:15,073 
You know what my new therapist told me?
  
229 
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:19,756 
That men turn gay because when they first start to masturbate...  

230 
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:22,354 
they pull on their thingy too hard.  

231 
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:26,559 
No woman's thingy can give them 
the same sensation.  

232 
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:29,075 
Oh .. she's worth every penny you pay.  

233 
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:33,279 
Don't leave me out there. I've missed the 
conversation about my lack of direction.  

234 
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:38,833 
Now they're on to your divorce. I'm sure we'll end up 
with the old family favorite: Where's Matt's girlfriend.  

235 
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,312 
Well I am not sitting next to cousin 
Stevie anymore.  Dana, you do it.  

236 
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,789 
He smells like Vicks vapor rub.  
- No, I think that's Grandma.  

237 
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:49,748 
You mean the bearded woman?  
- That's us in forty years, Dana.  

238 
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:54,675 
Stevie smells like pot.  - Oh good, I'll sit 
next to him then. Come on, dinner's ready.  

239 
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,710 
God, thank you for providing us with this meal and bringing the family together.  

240 
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,599 
And let us not forget those that aren't here.  

241 
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:11,036 
Your Arthur, my Ethel...  

242 
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,760 
and, of course, our father.  

243 
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:21,436 
As long as you have your health, 
you have everything.    

244 
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:31,949 
Mattie's gonna help mommy clear the table.  
You eat, young lady.  

245 
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,998 
Good girl.  

246 
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:47,476 
Matt was in pain. But I thought that it was going to 
be a quiet, respectable suicide. Like Jackie O had.  

247 
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:54,358 
I don't effing believe it.  It looks like one of those parties.  

248 
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,272 
I swear.  

249 
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:03,111 
Was Matt Shapiro your boyfriend?

250 
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:08,190 
Well, Brian?  

251 
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,876 
No, he was my client.  

252 
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,917 
May 2001

253 
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:15,833 
And I don't sleep with my clients.  

254 
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,514 
Hi, this is Brian Knight. 
 
255 
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:35,513 
It'd better be good news, 
or I don't want to hear it.  

256 
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,949 
Brian, hi. It's Dana Shapiro. Look, I'm sorry 
to bother you, but Mattie is really sick.  

257 
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:47,193 
He won't get out of bed and he won't 
see the doctor.  I'm really really worried.  

258 
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:50,636 
One day he's OK, and then the next 
he's throwing up everything.  

259 
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:56,591 
He gets these twitches. 
He blames his brain tumors.  

260 
00:30:56,760 --> 00:31:00,799 
That's NOT good news.  Matt's my best friend.  

261 
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,599 
Last week he was fine.
  
262 
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:08,877 
He's really weak.  The new 
cocktail - I don't think it's working.  

263 
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:13,716 
Dr Fisher said he's gonna die.  

264 
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:20,638 
God, she's a fucking bitch, you know. Not fair, 
Brian. Nobody should have to live like that. 

265 
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,791 
I've got to get going.  

266 
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,675 
Mattie... Visitors.
Mattie  

267 
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,756 
Oh, you wreak.  

268 
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,356 
Brian...  Shit.

269 
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:39,114 
There's blood in it.  

270 
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:51,238 
Timing is everything, Mattie.  

9
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:56,791 
Where's mom?  
- She's got the girls.  

272 
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:00,669 
Where's the artist?  
I want a smiley face.  

273 
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:04,389 
Hold still.  
- Hey, look at me.  

274 
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:09,395 
I am in a plastic.bubble. 
- Think what it did for John Travolta's carreer.  

275 
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:13,075 
Dana, we're not supposed to touch him.  
- Yeah, well screw it.  

276 
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:17,279 
It's cold under there.  
- I'll call the nurse.  

277 
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,709 
Christ, Dana...  

278 
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,519 
What do you think you're doing?  
- Oh my God. Mattie, I'm so sorry.  

279 
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:27,559 
Get away from him.  
Mattie, it's okay. It's okay  

280 
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,998 
Look what I found in the mail.  

281 
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:28,160 
You lied to me, Brian.  

282 
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:33,119 
Yeah. Guess I did, didn't I?  

283 
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,958 
Nothing personal. 
It's a lot more complicated than you think  

284 
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:43,477 
Oh, I think it's very complicated.  

285 
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:53,469 
Yes, there was a party.  

286 
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:59,312 
July 2001

287 
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:04,713 
I now confirm that you, Amy Eisner and you, Mona Rothschild have entered into a domestic partnership  

288 
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:08,793 
Acknowledged by the city of New York. 
Congratulations! 

289 
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:12,157 
It's about as romantic as a bank merger.  

290 
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,788 
Till death do us part.  

291 
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:05,432 
Hello sweetie.  
- Good to see you.  

292 
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:11,752 
Thank you for coming, Leo.  

293 
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:15,833 
I know you're very busy.
- I'm never too busy for you.  

294 
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,709 
Uncle Leo, this is a hard one.  

295 
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:24,078 
Mattie wants us to settle
up his affairs.  

296 
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:29,712 
Settle his affairs? Is he being sued, 
getting married , or both?  

297 
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:33,350 
No, Leo.  Matt is sick.  

298 
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,950 
Sick?  

299 
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:42,796 
He's a young man.  
My Stevie is 25, 26.

300 
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:47,192 
Sick...  You take him to the doctor. 
I'm the lawyer in the family.  

301 
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:52,673 
We need something called a Living Will. 
- Is that what he called it, a Living Will?  

302 
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:56,355 
Yes, mom. No more hospitals.  

303 
00:38:56,520 --> 00:39:00,832 
Look, I think Mattie is over-reacting a little. 
Don't you, Lila?  

304 
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,310 
He has Aids, Leo.  

305 
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,392 
Uncle Leo?  

306 
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:21,912 
Is he a fag lover?  
-Yeah, uncle Leo.  

307 
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:24,355 
Mattie is a fag lover.  

308 
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:31,033 
Lila, how could you let this happen?  
- It's not mom's fault.  

309 
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:34,237 
I know. I'm sorry.  

310 
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,832 
It's just...  

311 
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:42,475 
Lila, it's such a heartbreak.  

312 
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,880 
How sick is he?  

313 
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:51,237 
You look. You tell me.  

314 
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:55,192 
He's here?  
-What are you doing, Leo?  

315 
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:59,956 
Well, shouldn't he be in a hospital?  
- Tell me he's kidding. Please, tell me he's kidding.  

316 
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:04,672 
Look, Lila, you're my sister and I love you.  

317 
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:07,638 
But this, in our family...  

318 
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:13,117 
No!  No, not in my family.  

319 
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:18,877 
Shut the hell up, uncle Leo.  
- Dana, don't raise your voice to your uncle.  

320 
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:25,793 
You know, Leo. 
Sometimes you can be a real asshole.  

321 
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:30,396 
Lila...
Now take that schmut away from your face and sit down.  

322 
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:40,268 
I'm gonna have this conversation just once.
And then never again.

323 
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:45,269 
Matt is sick and he is gay.  

324 
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:52,152 
If that's a problem, it's not mine.  

325 
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:56,279
When you hurt your back, 
who shovelled your snow?  

326 
00:40:56,440 --> 00:41:01,514 
Who visited dad every weekend
at the nursing home?  Matt.  

327 
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,636 
My son.  

328 
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:11,309 
So, from now on... not one 
bad word about... my son.  

329 
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:19,152 
Now, I need you to help me 
with this Living Will.  

330 
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:25,076 
And quickly...  

331 
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:31,475 
Because right now...
I can't stand the sight of you.  

332 
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:15,717 
September 2001

333 
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,676 
Do you want to play?  

334 
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,036 
Barbie.  

335 
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:45,113 
Are we expecting someone?  
- It's Mona.  She called earlier.  

336 
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:48,477 
You told her we were here?  
- I answered the phone, Brian, so yeah.  

337 
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:52,519 
Whose  Mona?  - She's Matt's therapist. 
He's got a session with her. 

338 
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:57,549 
Mona's not a therapist. She's  
a death cult leader in training.  

339 
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:00,280 
Guess I'd better get up.  

340 
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:04,798 
I'm here for Matt's psychotherapy session. 
Hi. 

341 
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:11,232 
This is gay Bob. And today Gay Bob's going to 
go to the doctor 'cos he's feeling kinda sick. So...  

342 
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:16,349 
Okay, let's go to see Dr Barbie.  
- But I want to be gay Bob.  

343 
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:20,909  
Okay. You can be gay Bob, 
I can be Dr Barbie.  

344 
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:24,072 
Hello, gay Bob. How are you doing today?  
- I don't feel so good, I feel sick.  

345 
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:28,756 
I've not got the time to talk now 'cos 
I'm going swimming in Ken's pool.  

346 
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:34,153 
Here's a new drug cocktail. Here you go...
Take a thousand of those with every meal...  

347 
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:37,835 
and call me when you're sick again.  
-I do not want to be gay Bob anymore.  

348 
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,788 
Look, here's a red ribbon. Congratulations gay Bob.  
-Mona is here.  

349 
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:49,754 
Er, okay. Come here. Do you remember that 
video we used to watch of Pee-wee's Playhouse? 

350 
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:55,517 
Remember, when he said the magic word, he could 
yell and scream. You remember that? 

351 
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:58,433 
Okay,today's magic word is...
   
352 
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:00,033 
"Death".  

353 
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:04,078 
We've actually met before.  
- Did we?  

354 
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:06,629 
But that was when I was still in school.  

355 
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:10,918 
I graduateded with honors, 
got married, got divorced...  

356 
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:16,712 
Became a lesbian and now I run a counselling 
service called Forever Positive.  

357 
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:19,519 
I'm also a Clinical Psychologist.   

358 
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:25,310 
It's very positive having the children here.
Very positive!  

359 
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:27,789 
Now I remember you.  

360 
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:33,273 
It's important to use plain terms when discussing difficult topics with the children. Like dieing.  

361 
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:37,592 
We talked about it. THIS one does. How 
Auntie Dana feel about Uncle Mattie dieing?
  
362 
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,830 
Pissed off.
- Oh.  

363 
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:43,038 
Very open!.  

364 
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:46,033 
You are a very intelligent little girl.  

365 
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:50,637 
But we shouldn't impose our feelings
on to the children.  May I?  

366 
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:54,998 
I minoreded in child psychology 
- Be my guest.  

367 
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:57,518 
My name is Mona.  

368 
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:00,840 
Now, I'm gonna ask you a question.  

369 
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,197 
Take a second, then 
discuss your feelings.  

10
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:07,591 
How do you Amelia feel about 
your Uncle Matt's death?  

371 
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:14,471 
They're good.  

372 
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:51,949 
Life.  

373 
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:53,712 
Death.  

374 
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:56,075 
Plate....letss.  

375 
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:14,755 
The multi talented Princess Leila.  

376 
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:27,478 
And now returning to the stage. After 
an extended tour of outlying hospitals...  

377 
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:34,990 
The Queen of Green, the fellow 
with the cello,  Matt Shapiro.  

378 
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:23,470 
That's my interpretation of death.   

379 
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:27,474 
It's a prophecy.  

380 
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:30,154 
Don't worry... It gets better.  

381 
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:29,349 
I need a break.  
- Now?  Yeah, now.

382 00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:38,997 
Have you ever lost anybody close to you?  

383 
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:44,553 
You know, my client Daniel. He lost 
almost 80 pounds before he died.  

384 
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:47,632 
Sometimes when I held him..  

385 00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:51,076 
I could, I could see my 
hand prints on his body.  

386 
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:54,835 
Did Daniel die of Aids?  
- You leave him out of this.  

387 
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:59,710 
Why? Are you hiding something, Brian?  
Just how many of these parties have you had?  

388 
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:03,350 
Was there a party for John Butta?  Eddie Suarez?  

389 
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:07,513 
You haven't heard a word I've said.  
It's against the law to help someone kill themselves.  

390 
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:12,754 
A Class C felony. Second degree manslaughter.  
I don't make the law, but it's the law.  

391 
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:16,515 
there is no law when it 
comes to dieing that way.  

392 
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:22,118 
That's where you're wrong. 
There are a lot of laws when it comes to dieing.  

393 
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:29,035 
Others knew that he was going to kill 
himself, and they did nothing.  

394 
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:59,597 
Hey man, this is Rory's psychic hotline I see your future...  

395 
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:03,036 
You and afriend joining me at The Monster...  

396 
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:09,548 
Tonight and tomorrow for Rory's tribute. 
Two shows at 8-30 and 10-30 PM.  

397 
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:12,393 
Five dollar cover. I'll see you there.  

398 
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:19,599 
You sure there's nothing you want to tell me 
here, Nick, because I love you and..  

399 
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:22,433 
What are you saying?.  

400 
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:26,070 
How do you know?  
- Everybody knows that.  

401 
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:32,551 
Rory Metzler, that's who your looking for. 
- What do I have to go in there for?  

402 
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:34,676 
Because you look like a fag.  

403 
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:58,195 
The fat one in the middle, 
is that Rory Metzler?  

404 
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:39,998 
That was a great show.  

405 
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:48,399 
Can I buy you a drink?  
- Vodka tonic...  Stoli.  

406 
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:50,551 
Two, please.  

407 
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:52,790 
I'm Chris.  

408 
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:55,232 
Hello, Chris.  

409 
00:52:58,120 --> 00:53:02,238 
My friend Brian said you sing here. 
- Brian Knight? - Yeah.

410 
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:18,390 
Where are you from, Chris?
- Er Chicago.  

411 
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:21,074 
Are you in the Navy or something?  

412 
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:25,279 
Married?  - I like that.  

413 
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:31,718 
Do You have a lot of friends here?  
- Just Brian and Matt.  

414 
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:33,916 
You knew Matt?  

415 
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:38,438 
He died so quick.  

416 
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:44,188 
You've got no idea.  
The whole thing just spooks me.  

417 
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:49,756 
I miss him so much.  

418 
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:52,718 
I would have liked to have been there.  

419 
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:57,917 
I'd have done just about 
anything to have been there.  

420 
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:00,873 
Really?  

421 
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:08,829 
Honey, I tapeded the whole thing 
for my cable access show.  

422 
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:28,033 
Can I get tickets?  
- I'll sort that out for you.  

423 
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:54,835 
And here he is, our guest of honor.  

424 
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:58,757 
Any final words?  

425 
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:06,877 
Yeah... To anyone that's ever screwed me up...  

426 
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:09,429 
and there are many...
  
427 
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:13,393 
I forgive them.  

428 
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:18,039 
That is one classy lady.  

429 
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:23,193 
I'm Rory. I'm A list.   

430 
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:26,513 
So, you've got your own show?  

431 
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:34,828 
Yes, every third week I'm on for a two 
minute segment on the drag scene.  

432 
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:42,113 
Brian won't let me use this footage. 
- Why?  

433 
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:45,236 
You'll see.  

434 
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:04,956 
Hey, snap out of it, Brian.  

435 
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:10,595 
How did you find the video?  

436 
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:17,310 
How did I find it? It's none of your business how 
I found it. I found it. I ask the questions here.  

437 
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:25,029 
One phone call, Brian... I say indict him, 
and your life becomes a nightmare..  

438 
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:27,077
Already is.  

439 
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:30,391 
Okay, Brian. You have two  choices.  

440 
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:33,050 
You take the easy choice, you 
give me all their full names.

11
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:37,671
You take the hard choice, and you're 
gonna make this very, very difficult.  

441 
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:44,357 
You're such a big man, Brian. 
You think you're so brave.  

442 
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:50,038 
Who do you think you're dealing with? Hey,do you 
think Judy's brave? Do you think that Rory's brave?  

443 
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:54,876 
How long do you think they'll last?  
And Mrs Shapiro's got to be pushing 70.  

444 
00:56:55,040 --> 00:57:00,637 
Hello everyone. This is Melissa.  
Welcome to Matt's party.  

445 
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:10,437 
She's a riot!. Does she work with you?  

446 
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:27,479 
I seen Amy. Whose she with?  

447 
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:42,150 
Call my lawyer.  

448 
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:07,756 
I'm gonna make that phone call.
  
449 
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:38,758 
Hey, Nick. 

450 
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:41,710 
Looks like I got a date.  

451 
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:57,475 
Hi, handsome.  
- I got your page.  

452 
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:02,793 
Do you want another drink or something? 
-Yes, a double.  

453 
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:07,431 
Can I get two more of these please. 
Double with rocks.  

454 
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:12,749 
What's wrong?  

455 
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:19,669 
The word's out, it just about ravaged my guilt.  

456 
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:24,356 
Do you still have the tape? 
- Yeah, yeah I got it.  

457 
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:30,598 
I've been.. er shunned.  

458 
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:34,673 
Matt's friends cast me out,
like yesterday's trash.  

459 
00:59:34,840 --> 00:59:39,879 
And they'd better be careful because I know things.
- Hey, hey...  

460 
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:44,956 
Listen, you can tell me about it...  

461 
00:59:46,120 --> 00:59:48,918 
I think you know.  

462 
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:53,955 
Let me go.  

463 
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:05,510 
You lied to me.  

464 
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:09,878 
Never misuse a woman.  
- I'm warning you. I'm a cop.  

465 
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:15,114 
Yes, you're right and I'm warning you, 
never fuck with a drag queen.  

466 
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:26,076 
Oh, oh! Easy, easy!.  

467 
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:30,311 
I could charge them, you know.
I could put their asses in jail if I wanted to.  

468 
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:36,749 
That's a great idea. You think sarge would give my 
stripes for getting my ass kicked by a drag queen?  

469 
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:39,878 
A cold beer would help.

12
01:00:43,100 --> 01:00:43,950
Thank you.  

470 
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:47,031 
Smells good, mom.  

471 
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:52,513 
Tell me again about you let my baby 
get beat up in a gay bar.  

472 
01:00:52,680 --> 01:00:54,875 
I got carried away.
- Oh...  

473 
01:00:55,640 --> 01:01:00,350 
You never give up. 
You're so stubborn, just like your father.  

474 
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:05,510 
Hey, Mom I've been meaning to 
talk to you about something.  

475 
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:11,115 
Did Dad ever er...  

476 
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:15,709 
Consider suicide?  
- Who doesn't?  

477 
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:21,000 
No, I mean when he was in the hospital, when 
he was in a lot of pain. Did he talk about it? 

478 
01:01:21,160 --> 01:01:25,119 
Why are you asking?  
- I just want to know.  

479 
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:31,955 
To see your husband of 52 years just wasting away like that.  

480 
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:36,119 
May God forgive me, Nick...  

481 
01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:41,077 
If only he'd asked.  

482 
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:10,518  
So, you've got Matt's friends and 
family out there... For what?  

483 
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:15,754 
Are we all criminals?  
-I don't think you're a criminal, Mrs Schapiro.  

484 
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:17,433 
Well, you're wrong.  

485 
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:24,480 
October 2001

486 
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:57,036 
It is good to be out, Mamma.  
- I'm glad, dear.  

487 
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:02,830 
Er... listen, I gotta talk to 
you about something.  

488 
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:09,915 
Mom, I'm gonna do something, 
something big.  

489 
01:03:10,080 --> 01:03:14,278 
One of those big,... life changing things.  

490 
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:20,559 
These are special cookies.  

491 
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:25,076 
I made them with pot.  

492 
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:28,870 
Reefer? Weed?  

493 
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:36,870 
Marijuana gives you the munchies, and 
Brian says that you need to eat...  

494 
01:03:37,040 --> 01:03:40,669 
And it keeps the nausea away all the time.  

495 
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:44,151 
I read it.  

496 
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:48,108 
There's this nice lady in San Francisco.  

497 
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:52,118 
They call her Brownie Mary.  

498 
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:56,509 
Isn't that cute? 
Brownie Mary.  

499 
01:03:58,280 --> 01:04:00,430 
They're not bad.  

500 
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:04,797 
My brownies always turn out so dreadful.  

501 
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:08,949 
Where did you get pot?  
- Cousin Stevie.  

502 
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:14,240 
I think he sells it. I bought a pound. Very cheap.  

503 
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:19,235 
I'm so thirsty.  

504 
01:04:26,080 --> 01:04:28,196 
I'm dieing, mom.  

505 
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:33,476 
I know.  

506 
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:38,678 
I don't want to wait.  
I want to do it now.  

507 
01:04:43,640 --> 01:04:45,756 
What are you saying?  

508 
01:04:47,560 --> 01:04:51,917 
I can feel it getting closer, Mamma.  
Everyday is harder and harder.  

509 
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:57,713 
What if I wake up one morning and 
I can't recognize you, you know...  

510 
01:04:57,880 --> 01:05:02,078 
You remember the way it was with grandpa, he didn't 
know who we were.  I don't want to end like that.  

511 
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:06,870 
I don't want to...  I want to do it my own way.  

13
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:12,870
No, no, no, no...NO

512 
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:17,358 
No, don't...  

513 
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:20,796 
You don't want...  

514 
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,070 
You don't want...  

515 
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:29,795 
Suicide, mom.  

516 
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:22,756 
These chocolates of Gordon's 
are outrageous.  

517 
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:26,030 
This is a friend of Matt.  

518 
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:27,633 Y
Your name?  

519 
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:30,234 
No comment.  

520 
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:33,472 
You don't have to show my face...
Punk!  

521 
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:36,100 
To be honest with you Mr Campbell. 

14
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:39,478
Given the circumstances, a jury would question 
that kind of behavior, don't you think?  

522 
01:06:39,640 --> 01:06:42,712 
I didn't even want to be there. 
She made me do it.  

523 
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:45,273 
All that we're trying to do here is 
establish exactly what happened that night. 

15
01:06:45,880 --> 01:06:48,273
I want you to tell me what part you played.
  

524 
01:06:48,440 --> 01:06:52,638 
Mr Matlin, Matt said he wanted 
this to be special.  

525 
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:56,873 
Immediately I thought of a buffet.  
- A buffet?  

526 
01:06:57,040 --> 01:06:59,508 
You made a buffet?  

527 
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:02,717 
You catered a suicide.  
- Shut up, Judy.  

528 
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:06,236 
Who do you think had the most to 
gain from Matt's death? 

529 
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:08,436 
I'd say Matt.  

530 
01:07:09,640 --> 01:07:12,473 
I'm talking about his estate.  

531 
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:17,638 
He left some life insurance to his nieces?  

532 
01:07:18,600 --> 01:07:21,512 
Did he have anything else of value?  

533 
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:24,478 
Friends... Mona...  

534 
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:28,597 
Greedy sons of bitches,  

535 
01:07:28,760 --> 01:07:31,117 
Welcome to my will signing.  

536 
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:42,638 
Come on, people we got a lot of work here to do 
today. My relatives are coming over at 2-00 PM.  

537 
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:50,275 
And my Uncle Leo does not need to know that
I have a big, purple bong....  Dana.  

538 
01:07:50,440 --> 01:07:55,878 
Which will be the first item up for grabs...
- The Master Blaster.  

539 
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:05,755 
What's it gonna do?  Kill me?  
Actually, I've been feeling a lot better lately.  

540 
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:10,311 
Possibly the anticipation.  
- Why are you doing that?  

541 
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:14,996 
Because I want to die while
I can still wipe my own ass.  

542 
01:08:15,160 --> 01:08:18,211 
And always leave the party while 
you're still having a good time. 

542 
01:08:19,700 --> 01:08:21,211
Yeah... Hello.

543 
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:25,549 
I got the TV, so don't even think about it.  
- I get the VCR.  

544 
01:08:32,320 --> 01:08:34,072 
Anyone?  

545 
01:09:18,680 --> 01:09:22,514 
I got two Stevie Nicks albums
and a microwave.  

546 
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:26,472 
Mona got some ice tongs and a feather boa.  

547 
01:09:27,640 --> 01:09:31,030 
We were not into Mattie for his inheritance.  
- Miss Eisner...  

548 
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:33,509 
Mrs ... Eisner.  

549 
01:09:33,680 --> 01:09:38,549 
Mrs Eisner, this is a very serious matter. 

550 
01:09:38,720 --> 01:09:43,874 
A lot of Matt's friends were at that party. 
He didn't act alone.  

551 
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:48,716 
I helped Matt.  

552 
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:54,555 
November 2001

553 
01:09:54,720 --> 01:09:58,156 
Aids Treatment. Can I help you?  
Oh, Hi, Jackie.  

554 
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:03,992 
A dentist? Great. 
Dr Faluti.  

555 
01:10:06,160 --> 01:10:08,355 878.  
...878 Great. Thanks.  

556 
01:10:08,520 --> 01:10:12,718 
Oh, and call me when you get the Tuinal 
from your your mom's Doctor. Great, 'bye. 

557 
01:10:18,040 --> 01:10:22,556 
Hi. This is Amy Eisner. I'm a 
friend of Jackie Dowling's.  

558 
01:10:22,720 --> 01:10:27,475 
I have this impacted tooth and 
my dentist is out of town.  

559 
01:10:32,040 --> 01:10:34,395 
How's it looking for prescription drugs?  

560 
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:39,554 
Oh, Mona has a junkie friend who 
might be able to get us morphine.  

561 
01:10:39,720 --> 01:10:42,598 
A junkie friend...   Oh, that's good.  

562 
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:50,715 
Take the refills from my doctor... 
and make sure you use different pharmacies.  

563 
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:52,871 
Good.  

564 
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:55,395 
Do you think I need a disguise?

564 
01:10:57,040 --> 01:10:58,395
No.

565 
01:11:06,440 --> 01:11:10,672 
So tell me, do you have a departure date planned?

566 
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:16,190 
I didn't know that undertakers 
made house calls.  

567 
01:11:16,360 --> 01:11:18,590 
This is Chelsea.  

568 
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:23,238 
She's in terrible pain.  

569 
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:27,757 
What happened? 
- I fell off a friend's trampoline.  

570 
01:11:34,280 --> 01:11:36,919 
This prescription is for Pargorique.  

571 
01:11:37,080 --> 01:11:41,471 
It's an opium based anti-diarrhoeal.  

572 
01:11:43,240 --> 01:11:46,710 
All that jumping gave her diarrhoea.

573 
01:11:48,360 --> 01:11:54,037 
You are big boy...  
I'd go extra large. 

574 
01:12:01,960 --> 01:12:02,758 
Thank you.

574 
01:12:05,960 --> 01:12:08,758 
I could lose my license over this, you know.  

575 
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:22,638 
Look, you can have the rest of them.
But keep me out of this.  

576 
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:26,315 
You are part of this, Mrs Snell, 
whether you like it or not.  

577 
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:28,835 
Look, I wasn't even at the stupid party.  

578 
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:32,752 
I wasn't invited.  

579 
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:41,677 
Thanksgiving Evening, 2001

580 
01:12:44,240 --> 01:12:48,870 
Have you lost your mind?  
- Why? Have you found one?  

581 
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:54,957 
Who's that? You?  

582 
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:57,588 
You know it is?  
- No.  

583 
01:12:57,760 --> 01:12:59,591 
Me neither.  

584 
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:03,990 
This is big one in any case.  

585 
01:13:05,640 --> 01:13:09,189 
What you are planning to do, man...
It doesn't make sense to me.  

586 
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:11,191 
How do you not know...
It doesn't make sense to me either.  

587 
01:13:11,360 --> 01:13:17,310 
Well, why don't you stop moping and do something 
about it. Get a new treatment or another doctor.  

588 
01:13:17,480 --> 01:13:21,189 
What do you think I've been doing the last 7 years?
Nothing works anymore.  

589 
01:13:21,360 --> 01:13:26,309 
Have you thought about these girls? They love you.
Their first date, their weddings?  

590 
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:29,870 
I love the girls, you know that.  

591 
01:13:30,040 --> 01:13:35,114 
They told me the last 6 weeks that I was gonna die.
And what I've gone through since then, I can't do again.  

592 
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:40,070 
Well,I don't know what you are planning to do, Mattie. 
But you do not include me or mom. Do you hear me?.  

593 
01:13:40,240 --> 01:13:43,869 
Mommie is talking to Uncle Matt 
right now, sweetheart.  

594 
01:13:44,040 --> 01:13:48,909 
You keep mom out of this.  
For once, think of her.  

595 
01:13:49,560 --> 01:13:54,315 
I only hope that my daughters 
will be that kind for me.  

596 
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:11,276 
You don't have to go, mom.
You don't.  

597 
01:14:12,120 --> 01:14:17,558 
I keep imagining his face... 
What he'll look like when it's over.  

598 
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:22,276 
When he's dead.  
- Okay, Mom. Stop it.  

599 
01:14:22,440 --> 01:14:25,557 
That's it... I'm calling the cops.
I should have done this a long time ago.  

600 
01:14:25,720 --> 01:14:28,678 
Gaby,it's what he wants, okay? 
Just sit down somewhere.  

601 
01:14:28,840 --> 01:14:33,231 
I think he'll look peaceful... 
like he's sleeping.  

602 
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:37,393 
What is wrong with you?  
Act like a mother.  

603 
01:14:37,560 --> 01:14:40,313 
You lay off of her!  

604 
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:48,273 
Sometimes the only way to protect a defenseless child is to... 

605 
01:14:49,240 --> 01:14:52,789 
Let him go back to God.  

606 
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:21,957 
I'm nott promising anything. That I'll be 
like Shirley MacLaine at his death bed.  

607 
01:15:22,120 --> 01:15:25,192 
Remember Terms of Endearment?  

608 
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:28,557 
Uh-huh.. She the Academy Award for that.  

609 
01:15:28,720 --> 01:15:31,280 
What a perfect outfit.  

610 
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:39,353 
This sort of brings out the 
Sean Connery in you.  

611 
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:44,791 
You get out much? 
- What happened the night Matthew Schapiro died?  

612 
01:15:56,680 --> 01:15:59,353 
He had a fucking blast!  

613 
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:13,757 
Welcome viewers to a very special show. 
We are at Matt Shapiro's "Event".  

614 
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:18,118 
The first time anyone's been inside 
one of these gatherings with a camera.  

615 
01:17:22,520 --> 01:17:26,718 
Tell me who you are.  
- I'm Jodi, this is Alex, my boyfriend.  

616 
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:30,429 
and we live together.
- You enjoying the party?  

617 
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:32,795 
What's the celebration?  

618 
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:37,788 
You don't know?  
- No, I don't know. 

618 
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:45,988 
Oops!

619 
01:17:47,240 --> 01:17:53,190 
Be selective. Be pleasant. Be firm. 
Ther's no reason for things to get physical. Okay?    

620 
01:17:53,360 --> 01:17:57,797 
Michael Musto is definitely an A. 
As for the rest, decide for yourself.  

621 
01:17:57,960 --> 01:18:03,239 
Is Ru Paul on the A list or B list? 
- If she's in drag then, A. If not, then , B.  

622 
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:06,710 
I'm trusting in you.  

623 
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:12,750 
Listen, later on I might not get the chance
to say goodbye, so...  

624 
01:18:14,240 --> 01:18:17,596 
Laurie Anderson is definitely a B now.  

625 
01:18:19,680 --> 01:18:23,275 
It's so much more .......

626 
01:18:31,320 --> 01:18:36,553 
.. I'm gonna be all rigt....  
- Promise me you'll get some therapy.  

627 
01:18:36,720 --> 01:18:38,631 
Oh, Fuck Off!  

628 
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:49,955 
Why I have'nt I got one?  
- Why, of course, you can have a VIP pass.  

629 
01:18:52,360 --> 01:18:54,669 
Good.  

630 
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:03,189 
I was always at my best with you.  

631 
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:06,909 
But get a vocal coach before you screw up.  

632 
01:19:07,080 --> 01:19:11,870 
I'm serious. You don't know how 
much you're hurting people.  

633 
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:19,312 
Count age by friends,
and not in years.  

634 
01:19:20,720 --> 01:19:24,838 
Count your days smiles 
and not your tears.  

635 
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:30,949 
That's the last thing you're 
gonna say to me?  

636 
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:35,997 
That, and that I'm in love with you.  

637 
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:40,354 
Ever since I've known you.  

638 
01:19:40,520 --> 01:19:42,875 
Marry me...  

639 
01:19:54,360 --> 01:19:58,239 
HELLO... EXCUSE ME...

640 
01:19:59,080 --> 01:20:02,516 
Could I have your attention 
for a moment please?  

641 
01:20:02,680 --> 01:20:05,797 
Could we have a moment of silence...  

642 
01:20:06,840 --> 01:20:08,990 
For Matt.  

643 
01:20:55,520 --> 01:20:57,511 
Ten minutes...  

644 
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,594 
...and then, to bed.  

645 
01:21:09,480 --> 01:21:12,711 
And then The Simpsons ended.  

646 
01:22:25,720 --> 01:22:27,756 
See ya.  

647 
01:23:23,800 --> 01:23:26,268 
there was so much...  

648 
01:23:27,320 --> 01:23:29,754 
love in that room.  

649 
01:23:31,080 --> 01:23:34,709 
Sometimes people die alone.. 

650 
01:23:37,240 --> 01:23:39,276 
But...  

651 
01:23:43,160 --> 01:23:44,513 
this, this...  

652 
1:23:48,160 --> 01:23:50,515 
This was beautiful.  

653 
01:24:34,480 --> 01:24:36,596 
That was it..  

654 
01:24:38,120 --> 01:24:43,672 
I hooked up the IV and watched the 
liquid flow down the tube and into his veins.  

655 
01:24:44,840 --> 01:24:47,035 
You know...  

656 
01:24:47,880 --> 01:24:51,395 
That second, when I realized he was dead...  

657 
01:24:51,560 --> 01:24:53,869 
You feel so bad...  

658 
01:24:54,040 --> 01:24:56,429 
'Cos then I was dead.  

659 
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:06,879 
Is there anything else you 
want to add to your confession?  

660 
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:12,231 
They all killed themselves.  

661 
01:25:12,400 --> 01:25:19,158 
Eddie, John, Terry, Anita, Marty, Greg.  

662 
01:25:19,320 --> 01:25:22,676 
I wasn't there, but I know it...  

663 
01:25:22,840 --> 01:25:27,789 
See, all my clients die, but half of them won't wait.  

664 
01:25:29,640 --> 01:25:31,995 
And sometimes...  

665 
01:25:35,400 --> 01:25:38,073 
they have parties...  

666 
01:25:38,240 --> 01:25:40,754 
to say goodbye.  

667 
01:25:42,400 --> 01:25:47,997 
And, whether you like it or not, unless you 
can cure them they're just gonna keep on doing it.  

668 
01:25:49,240 --> 01:25:52,437 
Stand up and put your hands on the table.  

669 
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:14,277 
I'd like to add something to my statement.  

670 
01:26:14,440 --> 01:26:16,192 
All right. Go ahead.  

671 
01:26:19,200 --> 01:26:24,991 
It took a few tries to get a vein. I don't 
know why Matt asked me to do it. I hate needles.  

672 
01:26:26,360 --> 01:26:29,272 
But how could I say no?  

673 
01:26:29,440 --> 01:26:35,072 
After I got it in, it was easy 
to connect the IV line.  

674 
01:26:37,920 --> 01:26:43,438 
You're telling me that you assisted a man's suicide. 
- Yeah, that's right.  

675 
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:50,629 
I hooked up the bag of Dilotit.  
- Dilaudid.  

676 
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:56,591 
The drip was so slow that 
I had to squeeze the bag to empty it.  

677 
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:01,988 
It got all over his shirt.  

678 
01:27:02,960 --> 01:27:07,795 
He breathing became labored,  
then sporadic...  

679 
01:27:07,960 --> 01:27:10,599 
Then a death rattle.  

680 
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:17,112 
Then he opened his eyes 
wide and he was gone.  

681 
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:19,357 
You're really good.

681 
01:27:19,857 --> 01:27:21,357 
Really thorough 
 
682 
01:27:24,240 --> 01:27:28,974 
Your mother must be proud of him.  
- She is... Thank you.  

683 
01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:35,433 
And your father?  
- He passed away.  

684 
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:37,238 
Oh, I'm sorry.  

685 
01:27:39,880 --> 01:27:43,555 
How did he die?
- He didn't die, he was a police officer.  

686 
01:27:43,720 --> 01:27:47,030 
He died in the line of duty.  

687 
01:27:47,200 --> 01:27:49,475 
Your father was a hero.  

688 
01:28:01,480 --> 01:28:04,438 
To me, my son was a hero.  

689 
01:28:07,240 --> 01:28:11,153 
He had tumors growing on his brain.  

690 
01:28:14,640 --> 01:28:19,953 
Terrible seizures, and there 
was no way to help him.  

691 
01:28:24,920 --> 01:28:29,994 
Mrs Schapiro, it is unfair to lose someone 
you love, but there has to be laws.  

692 
01:28:30,160 --> 01:28:33,516 
When your father was laying there, suffering...  

693 
01:28:33,680 --> 01:28:39,277 
Did any lawyer's opinion 
matter more than the his?  

694 
01:28:44,080 --> 01:28:46,719 
What are you going to do to me?  

695 
01:28:51,160 --> 01:28:54,357 
My son is gone...  

696 
01:29:05,440 --> 01:29:08,159 
In my world, love..  

697 
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,389 
is above the law.  

698 
01:29:15,040 --> 01:29:16,998 
How many of them confessed?  

699 
01:29:20,600 --> 01:29:22,158 
Six.  

700 
01:29:22,320 --> 01:29:25,869 
That would be sick if all of them did it..  

701 
01:29:30,040 --> 01:29:33,237 
What do you want me to do?  
Indict all of them?  

702 
01:29:33,400 --> 01:29:35,550 
God damn it..  

703 
01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:45,078 
There was one night, when the pain was unbearable...  

704 
01:29:48,200 --> 01:29:51,397 
The morphine wasn't doing enough.  

705 
01:29:53,960 --> 01:29:58,511 
So he asked me if I would give him a bunch 
of sleeping pills so he could end it.  

706 
01:30:02,600 --> 01:30:05,478 
He said that nobody would have to know.  

707 
01:30:06,840 --> 01:30:09,434 
Oh God, Nick.  

708 
01:30:12,920 --> 01:30:15,718 
I told him I wouldn't do it.  

709 
01:30:19,040 --> 01:30:21,315 
He was begging me, mom.  

710 
01:30:36,720 --> 01:30:39,871 
I just don't know if I 
did the right thing.  

711 
01:34:08,800 --> 01:34:11,473 
So, I followed your trail.  

712 
01:34:13,560 --> 01:34:16,472 
Did it lead you to the killers?  

713 
01:34:16,640 --> 01:34:20,269 
It scattered in the wind around Union Square.  

714 
01:34:22,960 --> 01:34:27,670 
I'm sorry about arresting you.  
Now you have a record.  

715 
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:30,035 
I went a little too far.  

716 
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,036 
And I'm sorry...  

717 
01:34:36,880 --> 01:34:39,030 
about your loss.  

718 
01:34:49,440 --> 01:34:52,591 
You think you know how 
you're gonna react, but you...  

719 
01:34:52,760 --> 01:34:55,558 
we fool ourselves.  

720 
01:35:03,840 --> 01:35:06,877 
Want to know what happened?  

721 
01:35:35,200 --> 01:35:37,270 
I love you.  

722 
01:35:38,600 --> 01:35:43,799 
I can stop this, lila. He'll wake up 
tomorrow and be pissed off but er...  

723 
01:35:43,960 --> 01:35:46,599 
He'll wake up.  

724 
01:35:50,160 --> 01:35:52,958 
Mom, he's talking to you.  

725 
01:35:55,200 --> 01:35:58,954 
Please, don't let all this be in vain.  

726 
01:36:02,920 --> 01:36:05,992 
Please... That's all I ask.  

727 
01:36:07,360 --> 01:36:12,229 
Oh My God Oh God, we're gonna do this one does it. We're actually doing this.   

728 
01:36:13,080 --> 01:36:16,197 
Mattie, wake up you son of a bitch.  

729 
01:36:16,360 --> 01:36:18,476 
Wake up you son of a bitch. 

729 
01:36:35,360 --> 01:36:39,476 
Oh Fuck! Fuck, Fuck, Fuck!

730 
01:36:40,200 --> 01:36:43,795 
He's thrown up all the pills.  
- What does that mean?  

731 
01:36:45,720 --> 01:36:48,757 
Maybe you should leave.  
- No.  

732 
01:37:17,680 --> 01:37:19,477 
I can't.  

733 
01:37:19,640 --> 01:37:21,835 
I can't.  

734 
01:38:58,400 --> 01:39:03,190 
Hi, Bri. If you're playing this, 
then that means it's over...  

735 
01:39:04,360 --> 01:39:04,678 
I wanted to thank you...  

736 
01:39:06,680 --> 01:39:12,550 
and tell you not to feel bad or carry what 
I did around, like it's some big secret.  

737 
01:39:12,720 --> 01:39:18,511 
You can tell whoever you need to 'cos that's your 
job. It's the survivor's jog to tell the story. 

738 
01:39:19,680 --> 01:39:24,629 
Anyway, I wrote a little piece for you.
I hope you like it.  

739 
01:39:25,920 --> 01:39:29,071 
Take care of mom. 
I love you.  

740 
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:57,709 
The Aids crisis is not over.  

741 
01:41:00,360 --> 01:41:02,396 
Can I give you this?  

742 
01:41:03,400 --> 01:41:07,109 
The Aids crisis is not over.
- Thank you very much.  

743 
01:41:07,280 --> 01:41:09,589 
Can I give you some information on Aids?  

744 
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:13,594 
Okay, that's good.  

745 
01:41:13,760 --> 01:41:16,274 
May I give you this?  

746 
01:41:16,440 --> 01:41:18,476 
May I give you this?  

747 
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:25,950 
Hi this is Matt, I'm in heaven now. Leave your 
message and someone else will get back to you.

748

Hi, Mattie.  It's your mother.

01:41:32,040 --> 01:41:37,398 
I know it's silly but silly, but this is the 
only way I can still hear your voice. 

750 
01:41:38,520 --> 01:41:40,750 
I love you.  

751 
01:41:40,920 --> 01:41:44,037 
You are the light of my life.  

752 
01:41:46,640 --> 01:41:50,269 
I hope that I did the right thing.  

753 
01:41:50,440 --> 01:41:53,238 
I hope....  

754 
01:41:53,400 --> 01:41:56,631 
I think of you everyday.  

755 
01:42:00,240 --> 01:42:02,310 
Goodbye.  

756 
01:42:02,480 --> 01:42:04,277 
Goodbye, my son.
