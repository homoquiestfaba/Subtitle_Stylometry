1
00:03:35,623 --> 00:03:39,559
Frank, why don't you admit
that you're lying about this?

2
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:42,085
- Why would I lie about this?
- So then you would lie.

3
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:43,256
I didn't say I would lie.

4
00:03:43,298 --> 00:03:45,266
You just said,
"Why would I lie about this?"

5
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,632
From which it can be inferred
that there are things...

6
00:03:47,669 --> 00:03:50,763
No, no, no. Wait a minute.

7
00:03:50,805 --> 00:03:53,103
Let's assume that somewhere,
some time in my life...

8
00:03:53,141 --> 00:03:55,041
I have told a lie, OK?

9
00:03:55,076 --> 00:03:57,670
Does that mean I'm lying now?

10
00:03:57,712 --> 00:04:00,545
All right, so let me
just get this straight.

11
00:04:00,582 --> 00:04:01,947
By all means. Just...

12
00:04:01,983 --> 00:04:05,475
You're telling me
that your mother...

13
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,920
had sexual intercourse
with Frank Sinatra,

14
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:09,355
and that's why
you're named Frank?

15
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:10,584
That's right.

16
00:04:14,362 --> 00:04:17,297
- Uh-huh.
- What?

17
00:04:17,332 --> 00:04:18,629
And your father?

18
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:20,566
He never slept with Sinatra.
It was just my mother.

19
00:04:20,602 --> 00:04:23,093
Does your father
know about this?

20
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:25,833
He's the one who told me.
I think he knows.

21
00:04:25,873 --> 00:04:30,003
I can always tell
when you're bullshitting.

22
00:04:30,044 --> 00:04:32,478
No, you can't. That's why
I always beat you in poker.

23
00:04:32,513 --> 00:04:33,673
You never beat me in poker.

24
00:04:33,715 --> 00:04:35,012
- He always does.
- He doesn't.

25
00:04:35,049 --> 00:04:38,212
He always beats you and
you come home all pissed off.

26
00:04:38,252 --> 00:04:39,651
Does he?

27
00:04:39,687 --> 00:04:42,019
Don't be jumping into this.
He doesn't need your help.

28
00:04:42,056 --> 00:04:45,389
- He comes home crying to mommy.
- You do, sweetie!

29
00:04:47,095 --> 00:04:48,756
Why does this happen to me?

30
00:04:48,796 --> 00:04:50,491
You're always teaming up
with him.

31
00:04:50,531 --> 00:04:52,294
You're supposed to be
on my side.

32
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:56,133
But then I would always
be wrong, too.

33
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:58,331
You don't even know
what we're talking about here.

34
00:04:58,373 --> 00:05:00,603
Frank was named after
Frank Sinatra.

35
00:05:00,642 --> 00:05:02,269
- That's right.
- Yeah.

36
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:04,005
You mean, you didn't know that?

37
00:05:06,814 --> 00:05:09,681
Did I ever tell you
what my middle name was, Joe?

38
00:05:09,717 --> 00:05:12,083
Let me guess: Sammy, right?

39
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,247
Your mom did the wild thing
with the Candy Man, too?

40
00:05:14,288 --> 00:05:17,086
That's amazing.
It's Franklin Samuel.

41
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:19,958
You guys are really funny.

42
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:52,223
Hey.

43
00:05:54,162 --> 00:05:56,323
You all right?

44
00:05:56,364 --> 00:05:58,423
Yeah. I'm hung over.

45
00:05:58,466 --> 00:05:59,728
I can't believe
I have to face...

46
00:05:59,767 --> 00:06:02,861
a class full of
eight-year-olds tomorrow.

47
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:04,872
So take the day off.

48
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:06,897
Frank, I just took the week off.

49
00:06:06,941 --> 00:06:09,876
What's one more day
going to hurt?

50
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:13,039
Someday you'll have a job,
and then you'll understand.

51
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:14,946
I've had a job before.

52
00:06:30,131 --> 00:06:32,031
I don't even know if I do.

53
00:06:33,668 --> 00:06:36,102
- What's that?
- A little present.

54
00:06:36,137 --> 00:06:37,798
What, for me?

55
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:40,603
After all these years, you're
still spoiling me like this?

56
00:06:40,641 --> 00:06:42,370
If you don't want it,
I can give it to Frank.

57
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:45,607
- I'll take it.
- No, it's mine.

58
00:06:45,646 --> 00:06:48,547
Unless it's a jawbreaker.
Then you can have it.

59
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:49,880
Thank you.

60
00:06:49,917 --> 00:06:54,081
It's a ring. That's so sweet.

61
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:55,680
Yeah.

62
00:06:55,723 --> 00:06:59,682
- It's about time, pumpkinhead.
- It really is about time.

63
00:06:59,727 --> 00:07:02,127
When are we going to set
the wedding?

64
00:07:04,532 --> 00:07:07,194
- How about May?
- May. That's nice.

65
00:07:07,235 --> 00:07:09,430
May wedding.
What do you think, Frank?

66
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:12,337
May works for me.
I'm off the whole month.

67
00:07:12,373 --> 00:07:13,863
It'd give me
a little time to shop.

68
00:07:13,908 --> 00:07:19,244
I guess all that's left
is for you to ask me officially.

69
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,542
OK.

70
00:07:25,586 --> 00:07:31,354
Sarah, if this ring will do
until I can afford a real one...

71
00:07:33,194 --> 00:07:34,923
It's not funny anymore.

72
00:07:34,962 --> 00:07:37,123
It's not meant to be.

73
00:07:39,867 --> 00:07:42,028
Will you marry me?

74
00:07:50,578 --> 00:07:52,569
Well, say yes.

75
00:08:01,789 --> 00:08:05,885
OK. OK, yes. Yes.

76
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:11,824
About goddamn time!

77
00:08:14,168 --> 00:08:17,797
Is there anyone present
who knows a reason...

78
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:22,606
why these two should not be
joined in holy matrimony?

79
00:08:22,643 --> 00:08:26,704
Speak now
or forever hold your peace.

80
00:08:28,416 --> 00:08:30,475
Come on. Isn't anybody
going to help me out here?

81
00:08:30,518 --> 00:08:33,043
You better not do that tomorrow.

82
00:08:33,087 --> 00:08:35,078
You're just going to have
to wait and see.

83
00:08:35,122 --> 00:08:36,350
I'll kill you.

84
00:08:39,694 --> 00:08:42,822
And now, according
to the power vested in me,

85
00:08:42,864 --> 00:08:47,858
I declare this rehearsal over,
and amen.

86
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:49,529
Hi, Sarah. Hi, Joseph.

87
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:52,869
You know, I just want
to say congratulations,

88
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:55,375
and I know
I've teased you both...

89
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:58,242
about the pitfalls of marriage
throughout the years,

90
00:08:58,279 --> 00:09:00,804
but I just wanted to say...

91
00:09:00,848 --> 00:09:03,373
why didn't you listen?

92
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:06,818
It's not too late. You've been
shacking up for years.

93
00:09:06,854 --> 00:09:09,345
It worked out perfectly.
I got a tankful of gas.

94
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:12,553
We can head to
the Mexican border right now.

95
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:15,858
Duane and I
would just like to wish you...

96
00:09:15,897 --> 00:09:20,129
all of the happiness and joy
in the world.

97
00:09:20,167 --> 00:09:23,295
Yes. Marriage -
it's a beautiful thing.

98
00:09:23,337 --> 00:09:27,239
Sarah, it's a big day tomorrow.

99
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:34,270
I know you and Joseph
will be very happy together.

100
00:09:35,917 --> 00:09:37,646
You're a great catch.

101
00:09:37,685 --> 00:09:42,054
I don't know you that well,
but I've known you long enough.

102
00:09:42,089 --> 00:09:44,580
We've never really gotten
into any deep conversations,

103
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:48,652
but I consider you a friend.

104
00:09:48,696 --> 00:09:52,689
And Joseph's an old friend.
And I just want you to know...

105
00:09:52,733 --> 00:09:56,567
that I think you two are going
to be very happy together...

106
00:09:56,604 --> 00:09:59,402
and make a wonderful couple.

107
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,635
Do you have something
to say to Joseph...

108
00:10:01,676 --> 00:10:05,112
on the eve of the most
important day of his adult life?

109
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:09,082
I think it's great
they're in love and everything.

110
00:10:09,116 --> 00:10:13,212
Congratulations, I guess,
are in order.

111
00:10:13,254 --> 00:10:16,348
Make sure you have me
over for dinner a lot.

112
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:17,914
The thing about marriage,
though, man...

113
00:10:17,959 --> 00:10:22,020
it's not like poker where
you're sitting at a table...

114
00:10:22,063 --> 00:10:24,998
and you've got
a bad streak going -

115
00:10:25,032 --> 00:10:26,966
you can just walk away,
get out of there.

116
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:30,368
But, you know, marriage is...
You got to stay there.

117
00:10:30,404 --> 00:10:33,100
And you keep getting bad hands
and losing money...

118
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:34,835
and you lose
and you lose and you lose...

119
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:38,333
and it can break you,
and you can leave with nothing.

120
00:10:38,379 --> 00:10:42,839
Here's the portrait
of a successful marriage.

121
00:10:42,883 --> 00:10:46,910
Amy, could you tell
Joseph and Sarah...

122
00:10:46,954 --> 00:10:52,915
what has been the key
to your successful bond?

123
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,757
Forgiveness.

124
00:10:56,063 --> 00:11:00,500
You have to learn
to forgive and forget.

125
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:04,561
Are there any specifics
you'd like to go into...

126
00:11:04,605 --> 00:11:08,439
in terms of
exercising forgiveness?

127
00:11:09,844 --> 00:11:11,835
There's a little
forgiveness muscle...

128
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:13,972
and very few people
know about it.

129
00:11:14,015 --> 00:11:15,983
If you don't have it,
you're in trouble.

130
00:11:16,017 --> 00:11:18,884
That's right. And we've got
a little machine at home...

131
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:22,787
that exercises
that forgiveness muscle.

132
00:11:22,823 --> 00:11:25,656
- Really?
- I'll show you ours.

133
00:11:25,693 --> 00:11:27,558
If you'll show me yours.

134
00:11:28,963 --> 00:11:30,590
OK.

135
00:11:37,805 --> 00:11:41,901
How have you avoided
getting hooked?

136
00:11:41,942 --> 00:11:43,933
How?

137
00:11:43,978 --> 00:11:47,436
I don't know.
I never met a woman like Sarah.

138
00:11:47,481 --> 00:11:51,417
What about that cover
girl/actress you were seeing?

139
00:11:51,452 --> 00:11:52,749
What the hell was her name?

140
00:11:52,787 --> 00:11:53,913
Marianne.

141
00:11:53,954 --> 00:11:56,047
Marianne. Whoo, boy!

142
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:58,490
You should've married her, man.
She was fucking gorgeous.

143
00:11:58,526 --> 00:11:59,925
She was beautiful.

144
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,053
Only problem was, once I ran
out of ways to tell her that,

145
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:04,496
the relationship
sort of fizzled.

146
00:12:04,532 --> 00:12:06,693
But she was beautiful.

147
00:12:06,734 --> 00:12:09,396
Well, to the ones that got away.

148
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:12,372
How about to the one...

149
00:12:12,406 --> 00:12:13,930
- Hi.
- Hi.

150
00:12:13,974 --> 00:12:15,441
...who didn't?

151
00:12:15,476 --> 00:12:16,636
Hear, hear.

152
00:12:21,215 --> 00:12:22,705
Strong enough?

153
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:25,082
We're running a little short
on the bloody marriage mix.

154
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:28,020
Bloody Mary. Bloody Mary.

155
00:12:28,055 --> 00:12:31,513
- Right.
- Right.

156
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:33,493
You guys do have
a certain glow about you.

157
00:12:33,527 --> 00:12:35,757
Doesn't she? She's a saint, too.

158
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:37,627
Please.

159
00:12:40,401 --> 00:12:42,460
I'm marrying the most
beautiful woman in the world!

160
00:12:42,503 --> 00:12:44,630
- Please, stop.
- No, not even just the world...

161
00:12:44,672 --> 00:12:46,401
the entire universe!

162
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:49,202
I can hardly wait
till we're married.

163
00:12:49,243 --> 00:12:50,403
Why?

164
00:12:50,444 --> 00:12:52,969
Because I never have to have
sex with you again.

165
00:12:56,383 --> 00:12:57,748
A toast!

166
00:12:59,386 --> 00:13:01,183
To the bachelor's life!

167
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:05,425
No. I'm kidding.
All right, to marriage.

168
00:13:05,459 --> 00:13:07,393
Yeah. To marriage.

169
00:13:07,428 --> 00:13:10,022
- To our marriage.
- To our marriage.

170
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:13,994
- And to our friends.
- Yeah!

171
00:13:14,034 --> 00:13:16,935
To the bride and groom.

172
00:13:16,971 --> 00:13:20,031
May they treat each other
as well as they've treated me.

173
00:13:20,074 --> 00:13:21,234
Hear, hear.

174
00:13:24,044 --> 00:13:26,069
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

175
00:13:26,113 --> 00:13:28,513
Go! Go! Go!

176
00:13:28,549 --> 00:13:30,983
That's mature, Joseph.

177
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:36,781
Excuse me.

178
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:40,688
Hi.

179
00:13:43,898 --> 00:13:46,332
Jesus.
You'll be all right, Joey.

180
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:49,165
It's not so bad.
It's only the rehearsal.

181
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:50,864
Remember our wedding, honey?

182
00:13:50,905 --> 00:13:53,430
We got so stoned
I fell down her mother's stairs.

183
00:13:53,474 --> 00:13:56,238
Yeah, that was great, Duane.

184
00:13:56,277 --> 00:13:57,801
- I'm all right.
- Let's get out of here.

185
00:13:57,845 --> 00:14:00,405
- You OK?
- Yeah.

186
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:03,177
God, Joseph,
don't you ever chew your food?

187
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:04,844
Shut up, Nigel.

188
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:12,825
Haven't seen much of you lately.

189
00:14:14,862 --> 00:14:16,796
Got a girl?

190
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:19,355
- A couple.
- Oh, a couple.

191
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,528
- Do they know that?
- I'm pretty obvious.

192
00:14:24,271 --> 00:14:26,330
I've been thinking about
moving back east.

193
00:14:26,373 --> 00:14:27,567
Why?

194
00:14:27,608 --> 00:14:30,771
I don't know.
Things have just...

195
00:14:30,811 --> 00:14:33,541
I don't know.
I get headaches out here.

196
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:36,106
Everybody gets headaches.
It's the smog.

197
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:37,344
Yeah.

198
00:14:54,468 --> 00:14:58,131
You know that first time
that Joe and I broke up?

199
00:15:00,074 --> 00:15:01,769
Which first time?

200
00:15:01,809 --> 00:15:05,506
The first, first time.

201
00:15:05,546 --> 00:15:07,377
Why are you laughing?
The first, first time.

202
00:15:07,414 --> 00:15:09,041
- Oh, the first, first time!
- Yeah.

203
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:10,812
I'm sorry.

204
00:15:10,851 --> 00:15:15,845
Anyway, that first, first time
Joe and I broke up,

205
00:15:15,889 --> 00:15:18,915
I almost went after you.

206
00:15:20,995 --> 00:15:23,896
- Get out of here.
- I did. I did.

207
00:15:26,867 --> 00:15:29,301
You mean, after me, after me?

208
00:15:29,336 --> 00:15:31,531
After you.

209
00:15:31,572 --> 00:15:34,268
I guess it's lucky I was shy.

210
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:37,607
It would be pretty
uncomfortable now, wouldn't it?

211
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:39,306
We would have gotten over it.

212
00:15:41,749 --> 00:15:44,217
Joey would have thought
it was all about him...

213
00:15:44,251 --> 00:15:46,048
and once we got back together...

214
00:15:46,086 --> 00:15:49,078
he would have used it
to get off the hook...

215
00:15:49,123 --> 00:15:52,092
for whoever
he'd been screwing with.

216
00:15:52,126 --> 00:15:53,650
But what about me?

217
00:15:53,694 --> 00:15:57,186
He would've tried
to punch you, but...

218
00:15:57,231 --> 00:16:00,598
then you both would've gone off
together and gotten drunk.

219
00:16:04,705 --> 00:16:06,536
You're probably right.

220
00:16:06,573 --> 00:16:09,667
Yeah, I know my men.

221
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:13,108
What about you and me?

222
00:16:13,147 --> 00:16:17,140
Us? We would've been fine.

223
00:16:18,552 --> 00:16:19,780
You sure?

224
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:22,653
Frank... come here.

225
00:16:33,767 --> 00:16:37,168
See? We're still friends.

226
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,571
Poker, poker, poker!

227
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:52,216
He can still look.
A man can still look.

228
00:16:52,252 --> 00:16:55,346
That was no look.
That was an unadulterated ogle.

229
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:57,857
- OK, I ogled.
- At your own wedding, Joe?

230
00:16:57,891 --> 00:16:59,620
That's to you, Ror.

231
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:02,356
- To be or not to be...
- She was worthy of the ogle.

232
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:04,125
Come on, Joe,
at your own wedding.

233
00:17:04,164 --> 00:17:05,426
You were ogling Sarah.

234
00:17:05,466 --> 00:17:06,660
- I was not.
- You were.

235
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,998
I was, shamelessly.

236
00:17:09,036 --> 00:17:11,630
We all were. Why do you think
they wear white?

237
00:17:11,672 --> 00:17:13,512
So you can imagine them
as virginal and pure...

238
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:15,098
and then fantasize
about defiling them.

239
00:17:15,142 --> 00:17:17,975
- You want to defile my wife?
- For old times' sake.

240
00:17:18,011 --> 00:17:19,205
We're playing poker here,
fellas.

241
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:22,181
I didn't fantasize about
Deborah at your wedding.

242
00:17:22,216 --> 00:17:24,684
- Neither did I. Anyone?
- No.

243
00:17:24,718 --> 00:17:27,949
I really love these stimulating
intellectual discussions,

244
00:17:27,988 --> 00:17:30,422
but can we please
get through a fucking hand?

245
00:17:30,457 --> 00:17:32,482
- Rory!
- Just a second.

246
00:17:32,526 --> 00:17:34,426
It's a fucking quarter.

247
00:17:34,461 --> 00:17:37,021
- No. That's not the point.
- Here's a quarter.

248
00:17:37,064 --> 00:17:39,430
- Rory's in.
- No. No!

249
00:17:39,466 --> 00:17:41,764
- What have you got there?
- Four aces.

250
00:17:41,802 --> 00:17:43,770
- Bet or don't bet.
- Just a second.

251
00:17:43,804 --> 00:17:45,032
OK, Rory's out.

252
00:17:45,072 --> 00:17:47,768
No, wait a minute!
I'm in! Jesus!

253
00:17:49,009 --> 00:17:52,001
You live on the edge.
I call. Show your cards.

254
00:17:52,045 --> 00:17:53,637
- Three tens.
- I'm slaughtered.

255
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,477
Straight.

256
00:17:55,516 --> 00:17:56,744
I'm out.

257
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:59,617
Straight, queen high.
What do you got, Rory?

258
00:17:59,653 --> 00:18:02,315
- Nothing.
- You got to show.

259
00:18:02,356 --> 00:18:03,653
I don't beat a straight.

260
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:05,419
I called you.
You've got to show your cards.

261
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:07,984
- What's it to you?
- It's the rules.

262
00:18:08,028 --> 00:18:10,622
It's a game.

263
00:18:10,664 --> 00:18:12,859
Ante up.

264
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:15,562
A pair of queens? You stayed in
with a pair of fucking queens?

265
00:18:15,602 --> 00:18:17,331
Alas, poor Yorick.

266
00:18:17,371 --> 00:18:18,861
What do you get
so damn serious about?

267
00:18:18,906 --> 00:18:20,498
Because it drives me
fucking crazy.

268
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:22,839
- In Vegas...
- The Vegas speech!

269
00:18:22,876 --> 00:18:24,366
In Las Vegas, Nevada,

270
00:18:24,411 --> 00:18:26,311
they understand
the rhythm of the deal...

271
00:18:26,346 --> 00:18:28,143
and the sanctity of the game.

272
00:18:28,182 --> 00:18:33,085
Deal, Duane.
One game - seven-card stud. Pure.

273
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,520
They play it over and over.
You feel it,

274
00:18:35,556 --> 00:18:37,717
like the lap of the ocean
against the shore.

275
00:18:37,758 --> 00:18:40,852
You sit in silence,
study strategies.

276
00:18:40,894 --> 00:18:43,328
None of this banter...
Whose dick is bigger than whose?

277
00:18:43,363 --> 00:18:44,921
When's the fucking pizza coming?

278
00:18:44,965 --> 00:18:47,525
When is
the fucking pizza coming?

279
00:18:51,205 --> 00:18:52,331
Quarter.

280
00:18:52,372 --> 00:18:55,398
See it, raise it.

281
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:58,141
See that, raise that.

282
00:18:58,178 --> 00:18:59,839
See that, raise that.

283
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,007
I'll see that quarter
and raise you another.

284
00:19:02,049 --> 00:19:03,243
And another.

285
00:19:03,283 --> 00:19:05,046
What the hell
have you got there?

286
00:19:05,085 --> 00:19:07,212
Not much, apparently.

287
00:19:07,254 --> 00:19:09,188
Joseph here
gets two aces early on...

288
00:19:09,223 --> 00:19:10,781
with nothing underneath
to back it up.

289
00:19:10,824 --> 00:19:12,291
Table talk.

290
00:19:12,326 --> 00:19:13,793
Thinks he's going to chase
everybody out,

291
00:19:13,827 --> 00:19:15,488
which he does,
but I do not balk.

292
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:19,226
- Table talk.
- So, now he's got two pair...

293
00:19:19,266 --> 00:19:21,291
and nothing else.

294
00:19:21,335 --> 00:19:23,997
And me, I started out
with a pair here,

295
00:19:24,037 --> 00:19:26,505
which I have now turned
into three of a kind...

296
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,905
with this card here. Voila.

297
00:19:27,941 --> 00:19:31,069
- Oh!
- You can't do that!

298
00:19:31,111 --> 00:19:33,477
Sure I can, Joe.
It's to your advantage.

299
00:19:33,514 --> 00:19:35,539
It is to your advantage.

300
00:19:35,582 --> 00:19:38,244
So, now Joe's looking
for a long shot full house...

301
00:19:38,285 --> 00:19:41,948
and I'm looking for
a full house or a fourth nine...

302
00:19:41,989 --> 00:19:44,150
of which I noticed
none showed up in the deal.

303
00:19:44,191 --> 00:19:46,523
Am I confident? Yes.

304
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,687
Big man. Real mature.

305
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:50,754
See you, raise you.

306
00:19:50,797 --> 00:19:54,358
Well, I'll just see you.

307
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:57,564
I perceive
a homoerotic subtext here.

308
00:19:57,604 --> 00:19:59,003
Deal, Duane.

309
00:20:00,207 --> 00:20:01,731
Down and dirty.

310
00:20:07,114 --> 00:20:11,847
Bet's to you, Joe,
and whatever you bet...

311
00:20:11,885 --> 00:20:13,375
I'm going to bet forty bucks.

312
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,217
You can't do that.

313
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:17,621
- Sure I can.
- No limit.

314
00:20:17,658 --> 00:20:19,523
- But it's my bet.
- Then bet.

315
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,925
Then you're just going to raise.

316
00:20:20,961 --> 00:20:22,588
Then you know what
I'm going to do.

317
00:20:22,629 --> 00:20:24,062
I don't think
he's got his full house.

318
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:25,291
Think what you want to think,

319
00:20:25,332 --> 00:20:27,664
but there is such a thing
as poker etiquette!

320
00:20:27,701 --> 00:20:29,566
No table talk,
no betting out of order.

321
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:31,298
I've been saying this
for months.

322
00:20:31,338 --> 00:20:32,805
You'd be shot in Vegas, right?

323
00:20:32,839 --> 00:20:34,363
Yes, Frank
would be shot in Vegas.

324
00:20:34,408 --> 00:20:36,603
- It's not Vegas, Joe.
- But am I right?

325
00:20:36,643 --> 00:20:38,611
Yes, and God will punish him.
You're in or out.

326
00:20:38,645 --> 00:20:40,374
You're out of line.

327
00:20:40,414 --> 00:20:42,382
- You know the line?
- You know the line.

328
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:45,317
Guys, can you finish
the fucking hand?

329
00:20:45,352 --> 00:20:47,616
Fifty cents.

330
00:20:48,655 --> 00:20:51,419
- Forty dollars.
- Fuck this. Cash me out.

331
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:53,221
- Come on, Joe.
- Joseph.

332
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:54,989
Fuck you guys. No, no.

333
00:20:55,028 --> 00:20:57,588
Frank's Mr. Big Stud,
flipping cards, betting high.

334
00:20:57,631 --> 00:21:00,122
He called the hand. He won.
You happy, Frank?

335
00:21:05,439 --> 00:21:08,897
There are our lovely hosts now.
How are you doing?

336
00:21:08,942 --> 00:21:10,910
Does Frank want a wienie?

337
00:21:10,944 --> 00:21:13,105
Frank's been a wienie
for a long time.

338
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:15,171
- Is that mine?
- No, it's mine.

339
00:21:15,215 --> 00:21:18,412
- Don't break it, mate.
- I won't. See you later.

340
00:21:18,452 --> 00:21:20,215
Bye.

341
00:21:21,388 --> 00:21:22,616
Now, what's this?

342
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:24,248
I asked you to watch her.

343
00:21:24,291 --> 00:21:26,259
Fuck you. What am I, your slave?

344
00:21:26,293 --> 00:21:28,921
Family feud.
Are you guys fighting?

345
00:21:28,962 --> 00:21:32,159
Hi, Frank.
Look, honey. Your friend...

346
00:21:32,199 --> 00:21:34,326
She was over by the pool
all by herself.

347
00:21:34,368 --> 00:21:36,233
You said you'd watch her.

348
00:21:36,269 --> 00:21:39,067
You guys might want to think
about counseling.

349
00:21:39,106 --> 00:21:41,574
- Frank.
- Bye, Frank.

350
00:21:41,608 --> 00:21:44,771
OK. Sorry about that.

351
00:21:44,811 --> 00:21:46,369
Hello.

352
00:21:46,413 --> 00:21:49,507
Hi, guys.

353
00:21:49,549 --> 00:21:52,814
Hey, hey, hey.

354
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:56,050
Lauren, we're being harassed
by some guy with a camera.

355
00:21:56,089 --> 00:21:58,148
I'm not harassing anybody.

356
00:21:58,191 --> 00:22:00,659
He's not harassing anyone,
he says.

357
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:02,423
What are you doing here?

358
00:22:02,462 --> 00:22:04,396
I'm taking your picture.

359
00:22:04,431 --> 00:22:06,422
He's over here trying
to get pictures...

360
00:22:06,466 --> 00:22:09,026
of half-naked girls
without any make-up on.

361
00:22:09,069 --> 00:22:10,969
Come on. Be nice.

362
00:22:11,004 --> 00:22:12,665
What's this for?

363
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:16,506
- It's for...
- Personal use?

364
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:18,204
Is it about something?

365
00:22:18,245 --> 00:22:19,473
It's for personal use.

366
00:22:19,513 --> 00:22:22,073
Are you doing it
so you can stare at us later?

367
00:22:22,115 --> 00:22:23,343
It's about the party.

368
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:25,317
Really? That sounds boring.

369
00:22:25,352 --> 00:22:28,446
- It's also about me.
- That would be interesting.

370
00:22:28,488 --> 00:22:30,183
- You think so?
- Yeah.

371
00:22:30,223 --> 00:22:33,124
I think it would be interesting.

372
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,492
Give me the camera.
I want to do you.

373
00:22:35,529 --> 00:22:38,089
- Why?
- Because I like you.

374
00:22:38,131 --> 00:22:40,122
I don't think
I want to give it to you.

375
00:22:40,167 --> 00:22:42,965
Oh, no, no, no!

376
00:22:43,003 --> 00:22:44,994
Don't film me.

377
00:22:45,038 --> 00:22:47,404
Now... is it on?

378
00:22:47,441 --> 00:22:49,500
Is this thing on?

379
00:22:49,543 --> 00:22:52,205
- Do you see me?
- Yeah.

380
00:22:52,245 --> 00:22:53,735
Then it's on.

381
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:57,079
OK. Right, right.

382
00:22:57,117 --> 00:22:59,847
Tell us about your life.

383
00:22:59,886 --> 00:23:01,717
This actually wasn't about me.

384
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:04,053
It's actually about
the party out there.

385
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:05,786
Tell us about your life anyway.

386
00:23:05,826 --> 00:23:07,726
Why don't you film...

387
00:23:08,995 --> 00:23:10,587
All right, I admit it.

388
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:12,461
I don't have a life.

389
00:23:12,499 --> 00:23:13,989
You're breaking my heart.

390
00:23:14,034 --> 00:23:17,128
Are you one of
those cynical people?

391
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:21,436
No. More like bitter.

392
00:23:21,475 --> 00:23:24,069
Really? Why is that?

393
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:26,170
I don't know. I'm just...

394
00:23:26,213 --> 00:23:28,807
It must be a girl.
It's always a girl.

395
00:23:28,849 --> 00:23:32,808
- Lauren, you're a goddess!
- Female prophet.

396
00:23:32,853 --> 00:23:35,686
You're a woman's woman.
You know, girl.

397
00:23:35,722 --> 00:23:37,087
- Is it?
- What?

398
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:39,592
- A girl.
- No.

399
00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:41,287
I think it is a girl.

400
00:23:41,328 --> 00:23:43,262
We have a girl problem here.

401
00:23:43,296 --> 00:23:44,923
Why is it that girls
always think...

402
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:50,062
Did you love her
and then she left you?

403
00:23:50,103 --> 00:23:52,230
I told you there is no problem.

404
00:23:52,272 --> 00:23:54,240
Oh, yeah. I don't believe you.

405
00:23:54,274 --> 00:23:57,732
Hi, sweetie.
You making new friends?

406
00:23:57,778 --> 00:24:00,576
Hi. Are you making a movie?

407
00:24:00,614 --> 00:24:03,708
No, we're not. He is.
We're just helping out.

408
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:05,741
Do you have a statement to make?

409
00:24:05,786 --> 00:24:07,879
No, I don't think so.

410
00:24:07,921 --> 00:24:10,253
I think you better
keep on filming him.

411
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:12,315
Make your peace
with your public.

412
00:24:12,359 --> 00:24:13,656
Sorry. Bye.

413
00:24:13,693 --> 00:24:15,183
Walk that runway, girl.

414
00:24:15,228 --> 00:24:17,594
Work that vest. There you go.

415
00:24:17,631 --> 00:24:19,189
- Is that her?
- Who?

416
00:24:19,232 --> 00:24:21,063
The girl who left you?

417
00:24:21,101 --> 00:24:23,501
There's no girl.
Give me the camera.

418
00:24:23,537 --> 00:24:26,802
I think that's somebody who
hasn't been returning my calls.

419
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,102
Because I'm mad at you.

420
00:24:28,141 --> 00:24:29,699
- Why?
- You piss me off.

421
00:24:29,743 --> 00:24:32,371
What do you mean,
I piss you off?

422
00:24:32,412 --> 00:24:35,540
You got to watch out
for that unresolved resentment.

423
00:24:35,582 --> 00:24:38,551
It can cause diseases.
I'm sure you've heard that.

424
00:24:38,585 --> 00:24:40,177
Have you thought of therapy?

425
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:41,847
I'm in therapy twice a week.

426
00:24:41,888 --> 00:24:43,219
- You're kidding me.
- No.

427
00:24:43,256 --> 00:24:44,553
What do you talk about?

428
00:24:44,591 --> 00:24:46,957
All we talk about is you -
it's weird -

429
00:24:46,993 --> 00:24:49,894
and what a dick you are
but how much I like you anyway.

430
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:51,454
That makes me feel a lot better.

431
00:24:51,498 --> 00:24:53,489
- Whose camera is that?
- It's mine.

432
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:54,932
That's not your camera.

433
00:24:54,968 --> 00:24:57,402
You can't afford that
because you're such a loser.

434
00:24:57,437 --> 00:24:59,428
Why don't you eat me, Joe?

435
00:24:59,472 --> 00:25:01,030
OK.

436
00:25:01,074 --> 00:25:03,599
- Oh, no. Go away.
- What do you want?

437
00:25:03,643 --> 00:25:06,168
- I hate this.
- Take that thing off my face.

438
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:08,477
I just want
to have a conversation.

439
00:25:08,515 --> 00:25:10,244
You want me to say
something quotable?

440
00:25:10,283 --> 00:25:13,912
Yeah, why don't you say
something quotable?

441
00:25:13,954 --> 00:25:17,412
I'll give you more later.
Over and out.

442
00:25:17,457 --> 00:25:21,052
Nigel, come on. See you, Nigel.

443
00:25:21,094 --> 00:25:22,459
Good-bye, Frank.

444
00:25:22,529 --> 00:25:23,621
Hello.

445
00:25:23,663 --> 00:25:26,029
Oh, no. No, please, don't.

446
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:27,260
What's the matter?

447
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:29,530
I don't like the way I look.

448
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:31,469
I sound like a man
on those things.

449
00:25:31,504 --> 00:25:32,971
You don't sound like a man.

450
00:25:33,006 --> 00:25:34,303
I do, I do.

451
00:25:34,341 --> 00:25:36,309
Wait till you listen to it.

452
00:25:36,343 --> 00:25:38,903
"She sounds just like me".

453
00:25:38,945 --> 00:25:40,572
- Nice.
- Yeah.

454
00:25:40,614 --> 00:25:44,482
Before, you sounded like
your normal, velvet-voiced self.

455
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:50,583
Is this why you came here?

456
00:25:50,624 --> 00:25:52,819
No, I came to see you.

457
00:25:52,859 --> 00:25:55,760
Then take that thing away
from your face.

458
00:25:58,398 --> 00:26:00,764
Yes, Frank,
what can I do for you?

459
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,768
Why don't you...

460
00:26:02,802 --> 00:26:05,430
tell me all about me?

461
00:26:05,472 --> 00:26:08,566
Really?
The stuff you want to hear...

462
00:26:08,608 --> 00:26:10,576
or the stuff
you don't want to hear?

463
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:12,134
Just tell me everything.

464
00:26:12,178 --> 00:26:13,475
I don't know everything.

465
00:26:13,513 --> 00:26:17,540
Then tell me what you know.

466
00:26:17,584 --> 00:26:19,882
Starting from when?

467
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,182
From the beginning.

468
00:26:21,221 --> 00:26:23,121
I don't know you
from the beginning, honey.

469
00:26:23,156 --> 00:26:25,590
I only know you from the middle.

470
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:27,957
Then how about from there?

471
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:32,361
You're being so weird.

472
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,527
Why don't you just say
whatever pops into your mind?

473
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:39,231
The first thing. Whatever.

474
00:26:39,272 --> 00:26:42,332
This is...
Do I really have to do this?

475
00:26:42,375 --> 00:26:44,969
I don't think so. Why?

476
00:26:45,011 --> 00:26:47,502
Because I asked you
as a favor to me.

477
00:26:47,547 --> 00:26:49,640
See, that's it.

478
00:26:49,683 --> 00:26:51,583
You want me to tell you
all about you.

479
00:26:51,618 --> 00:26:53,950
I don't see you
since the wedding,

480
00:26:53,987 --> 00:26:56,581
then you show up
out of no place and expect me...

481
00:26:56,623 --> 00:26:59,615
to tell you all about you
as a favor to you.

482
00:26:59,659 --> 00:27:01,684
I think that just about
wraps it up.

483
00:27:01,728 --> 00:27:04,492
- You think so?
- I do. Give me that.

484
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,431
Tell me something about you.

485
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:12,836
Tell me something
about something.

486
00:27:12,872 --> 00:27:14,100
OK.

487
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:16,768
OK? God, just a minute.

488
00:27:16,810 --> 00:27:19,404
How about...

489
00:27:19,446 --> 00:27:21,505
How about the first time
I saw you?

490
00:27:21,548 --> 00:27:23,277
I already know that.

491
00:27:23,316 --> 00:27:27,082
No, you don't.
I mean before we met.

492
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,020
The first, first time.

493
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:33,751
There was a first, first time?

494
00:27:36,396 --> 00:27:38,990
OK, tell me about that.

495
00:27:39,032 --> 00:27:40,226
OK.

496
00:27:42,969 --> 00:27:45,767
When...

497
00:27:45,805 --> 00:27:47,773
- What?
- OK.

498
00:27:47,807 --> 00:27:49,934
I was...

499
00:27:49,976 --> 00:27:52,945
I was about to take
my last test...

500
00:27:52,979 --> 00:27:55,607
my sophomore year...

501
00:27:55,648 --> 00:27:57,081
and...

502
00:27:58,952 --> 00:28:02,115
It was in
English Medieval Renaissance.

503
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:06,882
I was just about to go
into the building...

504
00:28:06,926 --> 00:28:08,689
and I saw you.

505
00:28:11,297 --> 00:28:13,288
It was raining out that day...

506
00:28:13,333 --> 00:28:15,460
and the sky was dark...

507
00:28:15,502 --> 00:28:17,868
and you were standing there...

508
00:28:17,904 --> 00:28:21,635
in this long gray raincoat.

509
00:28:21,674 --> 00:28:24,905
You had this green umbrella.

510
00:28:24,944 --> 00:28:27,970
And, I don't know,
it was just strange.

511
00:28:28,014 --> 00:28:29,982
Everything was dark,
and there you were...

512
00:28:30,016 --> 00:28:31,677
with this green umbrella.

513
00:28:31,718 --> 00:28:33,549
And...

514
00:28:35,555 --> 00:28:37,853
And then the sky
was starting to break,

515
00:28:37,891 --> 00:28:42,521
and just as the light
burst out of the sky...

516
00:28:42,562 --> 00:28:44,325
you did the neatest thing...

517
00:28:44,364 --> 00:28:46,423
You twirled your umbrella
a little bit...

518
00:28:46,466 --> 00:28:47,956
and caught the light.

519
00:28:48,001 --> 00:28:49,832
You were
the most beautiful thing...

520
00:28:49,869 --> 00:28:52,201
I'd ever seen in my life.

521
00:28:57,844 --> 00:29:01,280
And then...

522
00:29:01,314 --> 00:29:03,305
then Joseph came
out of the building...

523
00:29:03,349 --> 00:29:06,341
and he...

524
00:29:06,386 --> 00:29:11,153
He went clomping up to you
like Gene Kelly in...

525
00:29:11,191 --> 00:29:12,681
"Singin' in the Rain".

526
00:29:12,725 --> 00:29:15,193
He was clomping
through the puddles...

527
00:29:15,228 --> 00:29:18,254
and that's when...

528
00:29:21,501 --> 00:29:23,492
I don't remember that.

529
00:29:27,707 --> 00:29:30,369
That's because
we didn't know each other then.

530
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:34,446
It was really funny.

531
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:37,143
The next semester
when I came back...

532
00:29:37,183 --> 00:29:40,277
and Joseph was my roommate...

533
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,083
and you were his girlfriend.

534
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:01,932
- Frank?
- Frank-o!

535
00:30:01,975 --> 00:30:03,465
I'm in the kitchen!

536
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,212
I brought
some strawberries, Frank.

537
00:30:09,249 --> 00:30:10,716
Good.

538
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:12,843
Where's the booze?

539
00:30:12,886 --> 00:30:14,911
- Hi, Duane.
- Where's the booze?

540
00:30:14,954 --> 00:30:16,114
You know where the booze is.

541
00:30:16,156 --> 00:30:18,989
- Hi, Frank.
- Hi. How are you?

542
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:21,550
- You look like shit, Frank.
- Thank you, Deborah.

543
00:30:21,594 --> 00:30:24,154
You're welcome.
Where's your date?

544
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:25,562
She's not here yet.

545
00:30:25,598 --> 00:30:28,123
Told you he wouldn't
have a date.

546
00:30:28,168 --> 00:30:30,068
Who is she?

547
00:30:30,103 --> 00:30:31,934
Ran into Marianne.

548
00:30:31,971 --> 00:30:33,768
Cover girl? She's coming here?

549
00:30:33,806 --> 00:30:34,966
Yeah.

550
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:38,671
Like us to leave you alone
for a few minutes, Duane?

551
00:30:38,711 --> 00:30:40,838
I haven't seen her
in a long time, that's all.

552
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,814
Look at his face.

553
00:30:46,719 --> 00:30:51,383
Is she your girlfriend again,
Frank?

554
00:30:51,424 --> 00:30:54,450
No, she's not my girlfriend.
She's a date.

555
00:31:31,164 --> 00:31:33,155
I don't know.

556
00:31:33,199 --> 00:31:37,226
I've had sex before -
more than once -

557
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:39,431
and I think
I've figured out why I do it.

558
00:31:39,472 --> 00:31:40,962
Go ahead, Joe.

559
00:31:41,007 --> 00:31:43,669
I remember going
through the birth canal.

560
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:45,405
- Oh, God.
- No, I'm...

561
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:47,970
My skin was really
sensitive back then...

562
00:31:48,014 --> 00:31:49,379
Want some wine?

563
00:31:49,415 --> 00:31:51,713
It was like
I was one big, giant penis.

564
00:31:51,751 --> 00:31:53,343
Nothing's changed, Joseph.

565
00:31:53,386 --> 00:31:55,616
No, no. Pay attention, please.

566
00:31:55,655 --> 00:31:58,215
There I was
in the birth canal...

567
00:31:58,258 --> 00:32:02,592
and my adrenaline
was really pumping...

568
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:05,621
and these dark, wet,
powerful muscles...

569
00:32:05,665 --> 00:32:06,859
were shunting me...

570
00:32:06,899 --> 00:32:09,868
and elongating my head
into a banana shape...

571
00:32:09,902 --> 00:32:12,029
which is a very odd sensation.

572
00:32:12,071 --> 00:32:14,869
And imagine the kind of
consciousness you have...

573
00:32:14,907 --> 00:32:18,035
when you're getting oxygen,
but you're not breathing.

574
00:32:18,077 --> 00:32:20,068
You're just alive.

575
00:32:22,382 --> 00:32:24,407
So now that I'm a big boy...

576
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:28,978
I find myself going back
to that place again and again...

577
00:32:29,022 --> 00:32:33,186
because it's only really
just before I blow my wad...

578
00:32:33,226 --> 00:32:34,454
Dear God.

579
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:38,760
...that I ever experience
what it was like being born.

580
00:32:38,798 --> 00:32:42,131
- That is so amazing.
- Isn't it?

581
00:32:42,168 --> 00:32:44,295
It's incredible
you remember being born.

582
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:47,397
One of my boyfriends
is a licensed rebirther.

583
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,668
Really?

584
00:32:48,708 --> 00:32:51,199
He's trying to regress me
back to the womb,

585
00:32:51,244 --> 00:32:53,678
but it's been
really difficult for me.

586
00:32:53,713 --> 00:32:55,772
Why?

587
00:32:57,317 --> 00:33:00,946
I think it's because infants
are so helpless...

588
00:33:00,987 --> 00:33:04,423
and I need to be in control.

589
00:33:07,794 --> 00:33:10,024
So, Marianne,

590
00:33:10,063 --> 00:33:12,429
how many boyfriends
do you have, anyway?

591
00:33:12,465 --> 00:33:13,625
Honey, please, that's...

592
00:33:13,666 --> 00:33:15,327
How many men do I have sex with?

593
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:17,768
Yeah, I'm just curious.

594
00:33:17,804 --> 00:33:20,364
More than one.

595
00:33:20,406 --> 00:33:23,307
- Congratulations, Frank.
- Thanks, Sarah.

596
00:33:23,343 --> 00:33:25,743
Girl fight.

597
00:33:25,778 --> 00:33:30,306
Is that two or a few...

598
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:34,684
or the Los Angeles Raiders?

599
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:37,588
Honey, what are you doing?

600
00:33:37,623 --> 00:33:39,921
What are you doing?

601
00:33:42,428 --> 00:33:44,396
Could I have
a cigarette, please?

602
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:47,092
I'm sorry if
I threaten you in some way.

603
00:33:47,133 --> 00:33:49,397
I happen to like men.

604
00:33:49,435 --> 00:33:55,305
And what is it about them,
exactly, that you like?

605
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:58,976
Different things
about different men.

606
00:33:59,011 --> 00:34:01,878
I bet.

607
00:34:03,816 --> 00:34:07,217
Well, I think
that's very commendable...

608
00:34:07,253 --> 00:34:08,982
and rare, in my experience.

609
00:34:09,021 --> 00:34:11,216
Shut up, Duane.
If it's so commendable,

610
00:34:11,257 --> 00:34:12,952
then how come
you don't like women?

611
00:34:12,992 --> 00:34:14,323
Good point.

612
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:17,158
I like women...
Hairless, obsequious women.

613
00:34:17,196 --> 00:34:19,289
You're so deep. It's true.

614
00:34:19,332 --> 00:34:22,267
He used to make all his
girlfriends shave their twats.

615
00:34:22,301 --> 00:34:24,997
You're a sick man, Duane.

616
00:34:25,037 --> 00:34:27,505
I don't like hair.
I like hairless girls.

617
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:33,308
Girls? Like a little diaper rash
in their creases, Duane?

618
00:34:33,346 --> 00:34:35,906
I think you would like men
a lot less...

619
00:34:35,948 --> 00:34:37,677
if you were married to one.

620
00:34:37,717 --> 00:34:39,981
I don't know. What about Frank?

621
00:34:40,019 --> 00:34:41,418
He's not bad.

622
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:46,619
I like Frank.
I'm just not the marrying type.

623
00:34:49,695 --> 00:34:54,462
Poor Frank.
Are you disappointed?

624
00:34:56,068 --> 00:34:58,764
Yeah, I'm devastated.

625
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:03,139
You're so sweet.
Why aren't you married?

626
00:35:05,244 --> 00:35:07,940
I guess I haven't met
the right woman yet.

627
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:10,471
What kind would that be?

628
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:16,921
Like... you.

629
00:35:16,956 --> 00:35:18,480
One like you.

630
00:35:18,524 --> 00:35:20,754
You're so cute.

631
00:35:20,793 --> 00:35:22,226
He is so cute.

632
00:35:22,261 --> 00:35:24,786
Honey, I'm about to cloud up...

633
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:27,732
and rain all over you.

634
00:35:27,767 --> 00:35:33,535
If you like me so much,
why don't you...

635
00:35:33,573 --> 00:35:35,666
bring me flowers?

636
00:35:35,708 --> 00:35:39,804
Roses? Would you like roses?

637
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:43,304
Which grow profusely in the...

638
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:45,010
ordure of romance.

639
00:35:45,051 --> 00:35:47,713
What the hell's going on here?

640
00:35:50,223 --> 00:35:54,683
I'm trying to tell your wife
that I'm in love with her.

641
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:59,760
Frank's trying to seduce me.

642
00:35:59,799 --> 00:36:03,997
You're trying to seduce me,
aren't you, Frank?

643
00:36:05,671 --> 00:36:08,196
I love you, Sarah.

644
00:36:08,241 --> 00:36:10,505
What the fuck are you doing?

645
00:36:10,543 --> 00:36:12,204
What the fuck is going on here?

646
00:36:12,245 --> 00:36:13,803
Are you nuts? That's my wife!

647
00:36:13,846 --> 00:36:15,507
What's your fucking problem?

648
00:36:15,548 --> 00:36:17,539
Go, Frank.

649
00:36:17,583 --> 00:36:19,551
Go!

650
00:36:19,585 --> 00:36:21,143
Thanks so much for dinner.

651
00:36:21,187 --> 00:36:23,781
It was so nice seeing you all.

652
00:36:23,823 --> 00:36:25,654
Take it easy, Marianne.

653
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:49,745
Want a cigarette?

654
00:36:52,952 --> 00:36:54,510
Thanks.

655
00:37:12,138 --> 00:37:13,537
Is it me?

656
00:37:15,374 --> 00:37:17,808
No. Sometimes being married...

657
00:37:17,843 --> 00:37:19,811
is like having
dog shit on your shoe...

658
00:37:19,845 --> 00:37:22,837
and nothing
to scrape it off with.

659
00:37:27,086 --> 00:37:29,145
Want to play some ball tomorrow?

660
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:32,681
You want more humiliation?

661
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:38,188
I'll pick you up tomorrow
at 6:00, all right?

662
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:40,721
How's your marriage
counseling going?

663
00:37:42,034 --> 00:37:44,628
It's good. It's all right.

664
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:46,831
You like your counselor?

665
00:37:46,872 --> 00:37:49,306
Yeah, she's all right.

666
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:56,210
You know what she said to me
the other day?

667
00:37:56,248 --> 00:37:59,649
She said
I was full of inner rage.

668
00:37:59,685 --> 00:38:01,448
You believe that shit?

669
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:05,514
I should have popped her
right then. Bitch.

670
00:38:05,558 --> 00:38:07,082
Duane!

671
00:38:08,327 --> 00:38:11,626
You begin to hate
the sound of your own name.

672
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:15,031
- Honey, come on.
- OK.

673
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:18,599
You'll be all right, man.

674
00:38:18,638 --> 00:38:20,936
- See you later.
- I'll see you tomorrow.

675
00:38:45,464 --> 00:38:47,659
I want to drive.

676
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,861
Why?

677
00:38:49,902 --> 00:38:54,100
I just think
it'll be a good idea.

678
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:57,473
I'm sorry, honey. I didn't...

679
00:38:58,611 --> 00:39:00,374
You piss me off.

680
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:21,162
And, Daddy,
she didn't deserve it

681
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:24,897
All the pain and the hurt

682
00:39:24,937 --> 00:39:28,703
And I could
never hate you for it

683
00:39:28,741 --> 00:39:32,472
'Cause I learned about love
when she said

684
00:39:32,511 --> 00:39:36,345
She said, "Honey,
your daddy is dead to me"

685
00:39:36,382 --> 00:39:40,113
"But to you,
your daddy he'll always be"

686
00:39:40,152 --> 00:39:44,145
"And although he made me
cry my last tear"

687
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:47,557
"To you,
he should always be dear"

688
00:39:47,593 --> 00:39:48,855
And Mother

689
00:39:48,894 --> 00:39:52,193
You're the kindest woman
I've ever seen

690
00:39:52,231 --> 00:39:55,166
A love like yours is rarely seen

691
00:39:55,201 --> 00:39:57,192
And although you were hurt

692
00:39:57,236 --> 00:39:59,329
You held your head high

693
00:39:59,371 --> 00:40:01,339
And thanks to you

694
00:40:01,373 --> 00:40:06,367
My daddy's alive

695
00:40:09,815 --> 00:40:12,716
- All right.
- Thank you.

696
00:40:12,752 --> 00:40:14,720
Thank you, thank you.

697
00:40:14,754 --> 00:40:17,222
- I wrote that myself.
- I could tell.

698
00:40:17,256 --> 00:40:18,985
Did you like it?

699
00:40:20,025 --> 00:40:22,550
- It was very human.
- Thank you.

700
00:40:22,595 --> 00:40:25,462
- Let's play poker.
- All right.

701
00:40:25,498 --> 00:40:28,228
- Got any eights?
- Nope. Go fish.

702
00:40:28,267 --> 00:40:31,600
- Come on.
- We're just being cute.

703
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:34,572
We'll be serious.

704
00:40:34,607 --> 00:40:38,270
You've got the old maid,
don't you?

705
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:41,541
Why am I always the last one
to hear about these things?

706
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:42,877
I thought we were friends.

707
00:40:42,915 --> 00:40:44,439
We are friends.
That's why we didn't tell you.

708
00:40:44,483 --> 00:40:47,611
We didn't want to shatter
your fragile fantasy world.

709
00:40:47,653 --> 00:40:49,587
Did they hurt each other?

710
00:40:49,622 --> 00:40:50,953
You are so dear.

711
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:54,357
They didn't hurt each other,
because I was Mr. Peacemaker.

712
00:40:54,393 --> 00:40:57,157
I wanted to pop
the son of a bitch myself.

713
00:40:57,196 --> 00:40:59,756
See, that really upsets me.

714
00:40:59,799 --> 00:41:02,427
You can't look at her cards.
You're still in the hand.

715
00:41:02,468 --> 00:41:04,402
Sorry. Hold on to that ace.

716
00:41:04,436 --> 00:41:06,165
Great. Ruin my bluff.

717
00:41:06,205 --> 00:41:08,139
What's a bluff?

718
00:41:08,174 --> 00:41:10,506
When you lie about your hand
and chase everyone else out.

719
00:41:10,543 --> 00:41:11,737
Gotcha.

720
00:41:11,777 --> 00:41:13,768
How do you know I wasn't
bluffing about her ace?

721
00:41:13,813 --> 00:41:16,077
Because you can't bluff
someone else's hand.

722
00:41:16,115 --> 00:41:17,878
Why not, Neil?

723
00:41:17,917 --> 00:41:19,475
Because you can't.

724
00:41:19,518 --> 00:41:21,213
Does it confuse you?

725
00:41:21,253 --> 00:41:23,414
No, it doesn't confuse me.

726
00:41:23,455 --> 00:41:25,184
And my name's Leo, not Neil.

727
00:41:25,224 --> 00:41:27,624
Why are you angry?

728
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:29,184
I'm not angry.

729
00:41:29,228 --> 00:41:31,788
Bet big, girl.
He's angry and confused.

730
00:41:31,831 --> 00:41:33,560
I bet all my chips.

731
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:35,965
You can't bet out of turn.

732
00:41:36,001 --> 00:41:39,698
When it's my turn,
the chips will be there.

733
00:41:39,738 --> 00:41:43,174
I'm sorry, but this Frank thing
is really upsetting me.

734
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:45,837
- You're so sensitive.
- Come sit between us.

735
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:48,506
A little drama's
good for a marriage.

736
00:41:48,547 --> 00:41:50,208
But they're best friends.

737
00:41:50,249 --> 00:41:52,046
Frank is her friend.

738
00:41:52,084 --> 00:41:54,848
We're friends.
Where does that leave me?

739
00:41:54,887 --> 00:41:56,047
Who's Frank?

740
00:41:56,088 --> 00:41:58,648
That guy shooting down our tops
at the barbecue.

741
00:41:58,691 --> 00:42:00,318
He was kind of cute.

742
00:42:00,359 --> 00:42:02,327
It's your bet, sweetheart.

743
00:42:02,361 --> 00:42:06,422
OK, big cock. Here's my bet.

744
00:42:08,033 --> 00:42:09,933
I think that Frank guy
needs to get laid.

745
00:42:09,969 --> 00:42:12,164
Precisely. He's chosen
his best friend's wife...

746
00:42:12,204 --> 00:42:14,229
as the object
of his clumsy affections.

747
00:42:14,273 --> 00:42:15,740
That's wonderful, Nigel.

748
00:42:15,774 --> 00:42:17,002
What?

749
00:42:17,042 --> 00:42:18,737
These girls don't need
to hear about that, man.

750
00:42:18,777 --> 00:42:22,076
These girls
are my trusted employees.

751
00:42:22,114 --> 00:42:24,912
They won't breathe a word.
They can keep a secret.

752
00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:26,076
Promise.

753
00:42:26,118 --> 00:42:28,086
Cross my heart, hope to die.

754
00:42:31,423 --> 00:42:33,414
Anyway, it sounds like
amateur dinner theater...

755
00:42:33,459 --> 00:42:34,619
Frank being Frank.

756
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:36,287
Now, that confuses me.

757
00:42:36,328 --> 00:42:39,422
Am I supposed
to be angry at Frank?

758
00:42:39,465 --> 00:42:42,093
He's a slime hound
with warts on his dick.

759
00:42:42,134 --> 00:42:44,967
- So you guys are friends.
- Exactly.

760
00:42:45,004 --> 00:42:47,336
You should do
that guy Frank, Lauren.

761
00:42:47,373 --> 00:42:48,806
I don't know.

762
00:42:48,841 --> 00:42:51,071
I checked him out.
He looked kind of small.

763
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:53,908
I need a big stiff one,
and I don't mean a cocktail!

764
00:42:53,946 --> 00:42:56,471
Oh, my God!
I think I just grew a penis!

765
00:42:56,515 --> 00:42:59,245
Poker will do it to you
every time!

766
00:42:59,285 --> 00:43:01,515
It's raining sperm in here!
Oh, my face!

767
00:43:01,553 --> 00:43:05,182
- Cross your legs!
- Oh, yes!

768
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,990
So you're really angry at him.

769
00:43:10,029 --> 00:43:12,395
I don't want
to waste my time on it.

770
00:43:12,431 --> 00:43:13,631
I don't want to talk about it.

771
00:43:13,666 --> 00:43:15,361
A man who gleefully admits...

772
00:43:15,401 --> 00:43:17,266
having had sex
with his sister...

773
00:43:17,303 --> 00:43:19,396
is now making moral judgments.

774
00:43:19,438 --> 00:43:22,430
- What?
- You had sex with your sister?

775
00:43:22,474 --> 00:43:25,966
She was five. I was four.
It was consensual.

776
00:43:26,011 --> 00:43:29,538
That's what allows me to make
these higher moral judgments.

777
00:43:29,581 --> 00:43:32,448
- I'm evolved.
- I see.

778
00:43:32,484 --> 00:43:34,349
I think I'm mad at him.

779
00:43:34,386 --> 00:43:37,878
Congratulations, Rory.
You've picked an emotion.

780
00:43:37,923 --> 00:43:41,825
I have this weird, crazy idea.
Let's play poker.

781
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:46,627
No, no, no. What do you think?

782
00:43:46,665 --> 00:43:49,463
I think that you are
chronically indecisive,

783
00:43:49,501 --> 00:43:50,900
Duane's overreacting,

784
00:43:50,936 --> 00:43:53,063
Frank is lonely and sad,

785
00:43:53,105 --> 00:43:55,164
and I am getting impatient.

786
00:43:55,207 --> 00:43:57,641
You have
a lot of hostility in you.

787
00:43:57,676 --> 00:44:01,134
I've also got two pairs
towards a full house.

788
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:04,149
The thing is -
and I'll leave it at this -

789
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:07,482
is that you guys can't know,
because you're not married.

790
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:09,043
I'm married, Duane.

791
00:44:09,088 --> 00:44:11,488
That's stretching
the definition a bit, isn't it?

792
00:44:11,523 --> 00:44:13,991
I believe I should be insulted.

793
00:44:14,026 --> 00:44:15,857
Shall I be angry with you now?

794
00:44:15,894 --> 00:44:18,692
Dog fight.

795
00:44:18,731 --> 00:44:20,460
I'm secure in my marriage.

796
00:44:20,499 --> 00:44:22,592
Whatever, Nigel.

797
00:44:22,634 --> 00:44:24,067
Nobody wake him up.

798
00:44:24,103 --> 00:44:26,765
What foreign creature
crawled up your rectum?

799
00:44:26,805 --> 00:44:29,103
A kiss is just a kiss.

800
00:44:29,141 --> 00:44:31,109
To demonstrate...

801
00:44:33,412 --> 00:44:35,073
See? No harm done.

802
00:44:36,648 --> 00:44:40,345
Don't you ever, ever
do that again, Nigel,

803
00:44:40,386 --> 00:44:42,354
unless I ask for it,
or I'm hard up.

804
00:44:42,388 --> 00:44:44,288
That hurt.

805
00:44:44,323 --> 00:44:47,952
Good. I'm glad. Good.

806
00:44:47,993 --> 00:44:49,483
My point is...

807
00:44:49,528 --> 00:44:51,325
What if I told Amy about this?

808
00:44:51,363 --> 00:44:54,025
Exactly.
Tell her, and we'll endure.

809
00:44:54,066 --> 00:44:58,298
They'll endure
if we all love one another.

810
00:44:58,337 --> 00:45:00,931
Nigel, you're so full
of insight and charm.

811
00:45:00,973 --> 00:45:04,204
You really are. No, I'm serious.

812
00:45:10,315 --> 00:45:14,979
This game is boring.
Nothing happens.

813
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:16,851
Do you want
to hear another song?

814
00:45:16,889 --> 00:45:18,584
I got eight more that I wrote.

815
00:45:18,624 --> 00:45:20,819
Let her play. It's nice.

816
00:45:23,829 --> 00:45:25,490
Once again

817
00:45:25,531 --> 00:45:29,194
I'm without my man

818
00:45:29,234 --> 00:45:34,069
My lover and my friend

819
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:43,171
Mine are hardly
the sort of novels...

820
00:45:43,215 --> 00:45:46,878
today's filmmakers
are racing to adapt.

821
00:45:46,919 --> 00:45:50,355
They're not seething
with raw sensuality...

822
00:45:50,389 --> 00:45:52,016
nor do they contain...

823
00:45:52,057 --> 00:45:56,960
periodic spasms
of orgiastic bloodshed.

824
00:45:56,995 --> 00:45:58,929
Also, one rarely sees...

825
00:45:58,964 --> 00:46:02,730
characters as old as mine
in American films,

826
00:46:02,768 --> 00:46:04,759
and when they do pop up...

827
00:46:04,803 --> 00:46:07,465
it's only for a scene or two.

828
00:46:07,506 --> 00:46:10,839
They're not allowed to be
the whole story...

829
00:46:10,876 --> 00:46:12,810
as they are in my books.

830
00:46:12,845 --> 00:46:15,370
Though, now that I think of it,

831
00:46:15,414 --> 00:46:18,781
I was approached
perhaps 20 years ago...

832
00:46:18,817 --> 00:46:22,685
by some people who wanted
to film my third book,

833
00:46:22,721 --> 00:46:27,522
which was called
"A Vulgar Superfluity".

834
00:46:27,559 --> 00:46:32,496
Although they suggested
I try to think of another title.

835
00:46:32,531 --> 00:46:33,862
They wanted to cast...

836
00:46:33,899 --> 00:46:36,663
some American actress
whom I'd never heard of,

837
00:46:36,702 --> 00:46:40,798
though she was apparently
quite popular at the time.

838
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:42,966
They showed me
one of her films...

839
00:46:43,008 --> 00:46:45,340
and I thought, "Oh, dear."

840
00:46:45,377 --> 00:46:49,245
"She's quite
immensely unsuitable".

841
00:46:49,281 --> 00:46:51,613
Her name escapes me now.

842
00:46:51,650 --> 00:46:55,279
Amy, dear, what was the name
of that actress...

843
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:57,982
they were so keen
to have play Daphne?

844
00:46:58,023 --> 00:46:59,752
Raquel Welch.

845
00:46:59,791 --> 00:47:02,521
Yes, that's it!

846
00:47:02,561 --> 00:47:04,654
Oh, dear, yes.

847
00:47:04,696 --> 00:47:06,391
That is one boring lady
in there.

848
00:47:06,431 --> 00:47:08,058
She's like
some kind of hypnotist.

849
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:10,625
You think she's bad,
try reading one of her books.

850
00:47:10,669 --> 00:47:12,109
Though don't mix them
with alcohol...

851
00:47:12,137 --> 00:47:14,037
as people have been known
to slip into comas.

852
00:47:14,072 --> 00:47:16,006
What's Amy's dad like?
Is he as bad?

853
00:47:16,041 --> 00:47:19,374
Her dad's great.
He ran for his life years ago.

854
00:47:19,411 --> 00:47:21,379
She married
this aging closet case...

855
00:47:21,413 --> 00:47:22,971
who's probably
in London right now,

856
00:47:23,015 --> 00:47:24,778
working his way through
the male ensemble...

857
00:47:24,816 --> 00:47:25,942
of "Starlight Express".

858
00:47:25,984 --> 00:47:28,976
- Fucking Nigel.
- He's fine.

859
00:47:29,021 --> 00:47:31,012
He has to sit there,
sneering at her...

860
00:47:31,056 --> 00:47:34,787
like she's in any danger
of forgetting he hates her guts.

861
00:47:34,826 --> 00:47:36,453
He's just jealous.

862
00:47:36,495 --> 00:47:39,862
Deeply.
Not that he'd ever admit it.

863
00:47:39,898 --> 00:47:41,729
And there's the money thing.

864
00:47:41,767 --> 00:47:44,327
Her bailing us out last year.

865
00:47:44,369 --> 00:47:47,304
I think it's really going fine.

866
00:47:47,339 --> 00:47:49,534
Sounds like you and Mom
don't get along too well.

867
00:47:49,575 --> 00:47:53,306
No. She thinks of me
as some disgusting habit...

868
00:47:53,345 --> 00:47:55,609
Amy will outgrow someday,
like thumb-sucking.

869
00:47:55,647 --> 00:47:57,581
Her expectations of me
have gotten so low...

870
00:47:57,616 --> 00:47:59,243
that it's actually
something of a challenge...

871
00:47:59,284 --> 00:48:02,447
to disappoint her,
but I do my best.

872
00:48:02,487 --> 00:48:03,784
This is really strong.

873
00:48:03,822 --> 00:48:05,289
I've been saving it
for her visit.

874
00:48:05,324 --> 00:48:07,292
How much longer
is she sticking around for?

875
00:48:07,326 --> 00:48:10,523
Ten days.
I have a strange premonition...

876
00:48:10,562 --> 00:48:12,530
she'll decide
to shorten her visit.

877
00:48:12,564 --> 00:48:13,929
Really?

878
00:48:13,966 --> 00:48:15,991
Nigel, are you in there?

879
00:48:16,034 --> 00:48:18,502
No, don't come in!

880
00:48:18,537 --> 00:48:19,970
Your guest just showed up.

881
00:48:20,005 --> 00:48:21,472
I suppose
you think you're funny?

882
00:48:21,506 --> 00:48:24,805
I'm stoned.
I think everything's funny.

883
00:48:24,843 --> 00:48:27,676
- Thank you for that.
- Who's here?

884
00:48:27,713 --> 00:48:31,274
You should enjoy this.
He invited Frank.

885
00:48:31,316 --> 00:48:33,784
- Frank is here?
- What'd you do that for?

886
00:48:33,819 --> 00:48:34,979
He's my friend, too.

887
00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:36,920
You can't expect me
to shun him for your sake.

888
00:48:36,955 --> 00:48:38,149
I hate you.

889
00:48:38,190 --> 00:48:39,953
I think you two
should kiss and make up.

890
00:48:39,992 --> 00:48:41,391
Or beat the crap
out of each other.

891
00:48:41,426 --> 00:48:42,893
That would be interesting, too.

892
00:48:42,928 --> 00:48:45,692
You're so clever, Nigel.
You really are.

893
00:48:45,764 --> 00:48:48,324
It's very nice
to meet you, Frank.

894
00:48:48,367 --> 00:48:49,800
Nice to meet you as well.

895
00:48:49,835 --> 00:48:52,360
I really enjoy your books.

896
00:48:52,404 --> 00:48:55,373
How kind of you to say so.

897
00:48:55,407 --> 00:48:57,307
This is Pamela.

898
00:48:57,342 --> 00:48:59,105
Hi. Nice meeting you.

899
00:48:59,144 --> 00:49:02,204
How do you do?
Are you a friend of Amy's?

900
00:49:02,247 --> 00:49:03,441
Who's Amy?

901
00:49:03,482 --> 00:49:05,382
No. Actually,
I'm a friend of Nigel's.

902
00:49:05,417 --> 00:49:06,714
We play poker together.

903
00:49:06,752 --> 00:49:10,017
Oh, I see.

904
00:49:10,055 --> 00:49:13,149
Help yourself to some tea...

905
00:49:13,191 --> 00:49:15,557
or there's champagne,
if you'd prefer.

906
00:49:15,594 --> 00:49:16,959
Thank you.

907
00:49:16,995 --> 00:49:18,462
Thank you.

908
00:49:18,497 --> 00:49:19,896
Hi, I'm Pamela.

909
00:49:19,931 --> 00:49:21,159
Deborah.

910
00:49:21,199 --> 00:49:23,167
Hi. Nice meeting you.

911
00:49:23,201 --> 00:49:26,068
- Hi, Pamela. I'm Duane.
- Hello, Duane.

912
00:49:26,104 --> 00:49:27,731
- Nice to meet you.
- Thank you.

913
00:49:27,773 --> 00:49:29,900
What nice little sandwiches.

914
00:49:29,941 --> 00:49:32,705
Champagne crisis.

915
00:49:32,744 --> 00:49:35,144
- I'll get it.
- No, allow me.

916
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:36,374
Really!

917
00:49:36,415 --> 00:49:40,613
- Hi, I'm Athena.
- Lauren. Great scarf.

918
00:49:40,652 --> 00:49:41,880
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

919
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:44,582
This is Josh.

920
00:49:44,623 --> 00:49:47,217
Hi.

921
00:49:47,259 --> 00:49:52,253
So, are you
working on a new book?

922
00:49:52,297 --> 00:49:55,664
Yes. I'm perhaps
halfway through.

923
00:49:55,701 --> 00:49:57,168
- Great.
- What's it about?

924
00:49:57,202 --> 00:49:59,568
It's a minor
superstition of mine...

925
00:49:59,604 --> 00:50:03,597
never to discuss my books
until I finish writing them,

926
00:50:03,642 --> 00:50:06,042
not even with my husband.

927
00:50:06,078 --> 00:50:10,242
It has at times been a source
of some friction between us.

928
00:50:10,282 --> 00:50:11,613
I wouldn't have thought...

929
00:50:11,650 --> 00:50:14,483
there was any friction at all
between you and Sydney.

930
00:50:14,519 --> 00:50:17,511
Perhaps you don't know us
as well as you suppose.

931
00:50:17,556 --> 00:50:18,955
Frank, can I talk to you
in the kitchen?

932
00:50:18,990 --> 00:50:20,190
There's nothing to talk about.

933
00:50:20,225 --> 00:50:21,658
No, there's a lot to talk about.

934
00:50:21,693 --> 00:50:23,251
What the hell's going on here?

935
00:50:23,295 --> 00:50:26,093
- I want to talk to you.
- Were you two an item?

936
00:50:26,131 --> 00:50:27,758
I would like to...

937
00:50:27,799 --> 00:50:29,630
I want you to control yourself.

938
00:50:29,668 --> 00:50:31,533
I'm not the one
who can't control himself!

939
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:32,798
Keep your voice down.

940
00:50:32,838 --> 00:50:34,169
Did you know
he was going be here?

941
00:50:34,206 --> 00:50:35,639
Is that why we had to come
to this thing?

942
00:50:35,674 --> 00:50:37,164
If I wanted to see him,

943
00:50:37,209 --> 00:50:39,109
this is how I would arrange it?

944
00:50:39,144 --> 00:50:41,874
Excuse me. Would you mind
going somewhere else?

945
00:50:41,913 --> 00:50:43,141
I was here first.

946
00:50:43,181 --> 00:50:45,149
He's following you around
with a big fucking hard-on,

947
00:50:45,183 --> 00:50:46,445
and I'm not supposed
to say anything?

948
00:50:46,485 --> 00:50:49,750
So, Pamela,
what sort of work do you do?

949
00:50:49,788 --> 00:50:51,380
You think
he came here for the tea?

950
00:50:51,423 --> 00:50:52,583
No. He's here
because you're here.

951
00:50:52,624 --> 00:50:54,785
That's the only reason,
and everyone knows it...

952
00:50:54,826 --> 00:50:56,726
and you know it,
and it's embarrassing.

953
00:50:56,762 --> 00:50:58,696
I don't like it.
You think I'm enjoying...

954
00:50:58,730 --> 00:51:00,254
I do think you enjoy this!

955
00:51:00,298 --> 00:51:02,766
You're the center of attention.
Everyone's looking at you.

956
00:51:02,801 --> 00:51:05,964
Fuck you, Joe!
I did not ask for this.

957
00:51:06,004 --> 00:51:07,995
Neither did I,
which is why we're leaving.

958
00:51:08,039 --> 00:51:09,973
No, fuck you!
You don't tell me what to do!

959
00:51:10,008 --> 00:51:11,441
If you want to go, you go!

960
00:51:11,476 --> 00:51:12,773
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

961
00:51:12,811 --> 00:51:14,176
At the moment, I would love it.

962
00:51:14,212 --> 00:51:15,770
I would fucking love it.

963
00:51:25,657 --> 00:51:27,625
I am sorry about that.

964
00:51:27,659 --> 00:51:29,058
I'm really sorry.

965
00:51:29,094 --> 00:51:30,925
It's hardly your fault, dear.

966
00:51:30,962 --> 00:51:35,194
It's just Nigel showing us all
how Nigel he can be.

967
00:51:35,233 --> 00:51:38,964
And what exactly
do you mean by that?

968
00:51:39,004 --> 00:51:42,667
I do not enjoy speaking to you
when you are drunk.

969
00:51:42,707 --> 00:51:45,904
Thank you.
That's very useful information.

970
00:51:45,944 --> 00:51:48,435
Shut up, Nigel.

971
00:51:51,416 --> 00:51:52,576
He's going?

972
00:51:52,617 --> 00:51:56,519
Son of a bi...
He left with my date!

973
00:51:56,555 --> 00:51:58,022
What?

974
00:51:59,524 --> 00:52:01,719
You people are fucking sick!

975
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:04,456
Oh, dear.

976
00:52:04,496 --> 00:52:06,054
Thanks for having us.

977
00:52:06,097 --> 00:52:07,621
Thank you for coming.

978
00:52:07,666 --> 00:52:11,898
- Hey! Fuck!
- Josh!

979
00:52:11,937 --> 00:52:13,700
Are these people
really your friends?

980
00:52:13,738 --> 00:52:14,898
Because they're not normal.

981
00:52:14,940 --> 00:52:16,305
You shouldn't be so sensitive.

982
00:52:16,341 --> 00:52:18,172
I'm so sorry.

983
00:52:18,210 --> 00:52:20,872
Darling,
if you would like my advice...

984
00:52:20,912 --> 00:52:22,709
No, we would not
like your advice.

985
00:52:22,747 --> 00:52:24,681
Not with that farce
you call a marriage.

986
00:52:24,716 --> 00:52:26,115
Stop it! Nigel!

987
00:52:26,151 --> 00:52:29,279
I will not stay in this house
one minute longer!

988
00:52:29,321 --> 00:52:31,789
I'm timing you.

989
00:52:31,823 --> 00:52:34,451
59... 58...

990
00:52:34,493 --> 00:52:36,120
Shut up!

991
00:52:36,161 --> 00:52:38,095
You are a nasty boy!

992
00:52:38,129 --> 00:52:42,088
55... 54... 53...

993
00:52:43,401 --> 00:52:44,959
Sally, pick up the phone.

994
00:52:45,003 --> 00:52:46,561
Sally.

995
00:52:46,605 --> 00:52:48,630
Stop it, Nigel!

996
00:52:48,673 --> 00:52:51,267
Caroline, I'm a very nasty boy.

997
00:52:51,309 --> 00:52:52,833
I want a divorce!

998
00:52:52,878 --> 00:52:54,607
Frank?

999
00:52:56,281 --> 00:52:58,340
You know things
are getting pretty bad...

1000
00:52:58,383 --> 00:53:00,544
when we have
the best marriage in the room.

1001
00:53:17,068 --> 00:53:20,902
I hope you don't think
you're going to sleep with me.

1002
00:53:20,939 --> 00:53:22,566
What?

1003
00:53:22,607 --> 00:53:26,475
I hope you don't think
you're going to sleep with me.

1004
00:53:26,511 --> 00:53:29,480
Actually,
it hadn't crossed my mind.

1005
00:53:29,514 --> 00:53:31,675
Oh, really?

1006
00:53:31,716 --> 00:53:33,946
- I'm happily married.
- I know.

1007
00:53:33,985 --> 00:53:36,783
That son of a bitch.
He's such a fucking...

1008
00:53:36,821 --> 00:53:38,686
I'm sorry. I shouldn't
be talking like this.

1009
00:53:38,723 --> 00:53:40,987
We're all sorry.
You're sorry, right, Frank?

1010
00:53:41,026 --> 00:53:43,051
I'm going to
take you home first, OK?

1011
00:53:43,094 --> 00:53:44,891
OK, thank you.

1012
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:46,158
Sarah...

1013
00:53:46,197 --> 00:53:48,188
No, Frank, please don't start.

1014
00:53:48,233 --> 00:53:50,360
- I just...
- Forget it. Please?

1015
00:53:53,738 --> 00:53:56,206
So, what kind of work do you do?

1016
00:53:56,241 --> 00:53:59,733
Me? I'm a body double
for Demi Moore.

1017
00:53:59,778 --> 00:54:01,040
Really? That's really...

1018
00:54:01,079 --> 00:54:03,912
She believes me. Oh, my God.

1019
00:54:03,949 --> 00:54:05,678
You didn't have to come with us.

1020
00:54:05,717 --> 00:54:07,548
There's no reason
for this attitude.

1021
00:54:07,586 --> 00:54:09,315
Look, honey, I came with him.

1022
00:54:09,354 --> 00:54:12,346
Everybody else was sloshed,
stoned, or psychotic...

1023
00:54:12,390 --> 00:54:14,358
and a cab in this town
is 50 bucks.

1024
00:54:14,392 --> 00:54:17,088
Yada, yada, yada.
God, she goes on.

1025
00:54:17,128 --> 00:54:19,562
All right.
He'll take me home. Great.

1026
00:54:19,598 --> 00:54:20,929
Sarah, can I just...

1027
00:54:20,966 --> 00:54:24,163
Frank, no!
I'm OK. I'm really OK.

1028
00:54:24,202 --> 00:54:26,432
I do have control over my life.

1029
00:54:26,471 --> 00:54:28,268
It might not seem that way,
but I do.

1030
00:54:28,306 --> 00:54:29,603
I am not stupid.

1031
00:54:29,641 --> 00:54:32,166
I know Joseph's an asshole,
but I married him.

1032
00:54:32,210 --> 00:54:33,541
He's my asshole.

1033
00:54:35,513 --> 00:54:37,310
See that house?

1034
00:54:37,349 --> 00:54:39,180
I designed the landscaping.

1035
00:54:39,217 --> 00:54:41,014
It's nice.

1036
00:54:41,052 --> 00:54:43,020
It's better than nice.

1037
00:54:43,054 --> 00:54:45,147
The dopes that live there
don't deserve it.

1038
00:54:45,190 --> 00:54:46,555
That's the rub,

1039
00:54:46,591 --> 00:54:49,287
that only rich people
can really afford...

1040
00:54:49,327 --> 00:54:50,954
property
that's worth landscaping...

1041
00:54:50,996 --> 00:54:52,623
but then they don't
even care about it.

1042
00:54:52,664 --> 00:54:55,292
It's like upkeep to them,
maintenance,

1043
00:54:55,333 --> 00:54:58,700
like I'm changing
shingles on their roof.

1044
00:54:58,737 --> 00:55:01,365
So you're an artist, then.

1045
00:55:01,406 --> 00:55:03,374
Sometimes.

1046
00:55:03,408 --> 00:55:05,376
And the rest of the time?

1047
00:55:05,410 --> 00:55:09,005
You mean,
what do I do for money?

1048
00:55:09,047 --> 00:55:12,039
I design landscaping.

1049
00:55:18,590 --> 00:55:22,185
I like that green mushroom tree.

1050
00:55:22,227 --> 00:55:25,628
- It's an umbrella.
- You're kidding.

1051
00:55:25,664 --> 00:55:28,189
I did it for my wife.

1052
00:55:28,233 --> 00:55:29,825
Does she know?

1053
00:55:29,868 --> 00:55:32,598
I drove her by it once.

1054
00:55:32,637 --> 00:55:34,867
Like an inside joke, huh?

1055
00:55:34,906 --> 00:55:36,237
Sort of.

1056
00:55:39,577 --> 00:55:42,478
Did you ever think
that maybe you made a mistake?

1057
00:55:42,514 --> 00:55:44,141
What are you talking about?

1058
00:55:44,182 --> 00:55:46,343
Marrying him.

1059
00:55:46,384 --> 00:55:48,352
How can you say that?
I loved him.

1060
00:55:48,386 --> 00:55:50,183
"Loved".
That's exactly what I'm saying.

1061
00:55:50,221 --> 00:55:51,620
That's past tense, you see?

1062
00:55:51,656 --> 00:55:53,123
Frank, stop.

1063
00:55:53,158 --> 00:55:54,420
What...

1064
00:55:54,459 --> 00:55:58,589
- Sarah, I love you now.
- Hello!

1065
00:55:58,630 --> 00:56:01,531
Frank, you got to understand.

1066
00:56:01,566 --> 00:56:03,659
We're just friends.
That's all we are.

1067
00:56:03,702 --> 00:56:06,364
Come on. We've always been
more than friends.

1068
00:56:06,404 --> 00:56:08,099
You know that as well as I do.

1069
00:56:08,139 --> 00:56:10,505
And I want you now, OK?

1070
00:56:10,542 --> 00:56:13,102
You want me now
because now I'm taken.

1071
00:56:13,144 --> 00:56:15,112
You only ever want what's taken.

1072
00:56:15,146 --> 00:56:16,579
That is such bullshit!

1073
00:56:16,614 --> 00:56:18,673
No, it isn't.
That's a pattern with you.

1074
00:56:18,717 --> 00:56:20,651
You waited until after
we were married...

1075
00:56:20,685 --> 00:56:22,448
I waited till you let me!

1076
00:56:22,487 --> 00:56:23,749
- I let you?
- Yes!

1077
00:56:23,788 --> 00:56:25,187
How?

1078
00:56:27,726 --> 00:56:31,628
The day before the wedding,
when you kissed me.

1079
00:56:31,663 --> 00:56:33,426
You kissed?

1080
00:56:33,465 --> 00:56:36,298
Does the bimbo
with your husband know...

1081
00:56:36,334 --> 00:56:37,631
- Shut up!
- OK.

1082
00:56:37,669 --> 00:56:40,001
Frank, that was just a kiss.

1083
00:56:46,244 --> 00:56:48,109
I'm only here...

1084
00:56:48,146 --> 00:56:50,979
because my best friend
is trying to fuck my wife.

1085
00:56:51,015 --> 00:56:53,313
Maybe he's in love with her.

1086
00:56:53,351 --> 00:56:55,581
He doesn't really even know her.

1087
00:56:57,388 --> 00:56:58,855
Why not? You're best friends.

1088
00:56:58,890 --> 00:57:00,881
They must see each other a lot.

1089
00:57:00,925 --> 00:57:02,358
Yeah.

1090
00:57:03,661 --> 00:57:06,391
Then he does know her.

1091
00:57:06,431 --> 00:57:07,921
No.

1092
00:57:11,669 --> 00:57:13,398
She married me.

1093
00:57:20,979 --> 00:57:22,207
Oh, God.

1094
00:57:31,556 --> 00:57:33,717
She's probably with him
right now.

1095
00:57:33,758 --> 00:57:37,319
No. She's just not with me.

1096
00:57:37,362 --> 00:57:40,229
That's right. I'm with you.

1097
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:52,409
You really want me to pull over
and drop you off?

1098
00:57:52,443 --> 00:57:53,933
Is that what you want?

1099
00:57:57,949 --> 00:57:59,849
You people are unbelievable.

1100
00:57:59,884 --> 00:58:02,216
You just do this
to entertain yourselves?

1101
00:58:02,253 --> 00:58:05,711
Don't answer that.
It's a rhetorical question.

1102
00:58:33,651 --> 00:58:35,619
Let's go to my bedroom.

1103
00:58:41,459 --> 00:58:44,087
Let's go to my bedroom.

1104
00:58:44,128 --> 00:58:45,595
You know what?

1105
00:58:45,630 --> 00:58:48,064
You're sweet, but this is...

1106
00:58:48,099 --> 00:58:49,828
You're fucked up.

1107
00:58:49,868 --> 00:58:53,964
No, I'm not. I'm 24,
and I don't give a shit.

1108
00:58:54,005 --> 00:58:56,997
None of you mean anything to me.

1109
00:58:57,041 --> 00:58:58,770
That's sad.

1110
00:58:58,810 --> 00:59:00,801
You would know.

1111
00:59:03,114 --> 00:59:05,605
I got to go. I'm sorry.

1112
01:00:30,101 --> 01:00:32,729
Your husband
is a really hot property.

1113
01:00:32,770 --> 01:00:35,637
Have you always known
that the big guy here...

1114
01:00:35,673 --> 01:00:37,004
was going to make it so big?

1115
01:00:37,041 --> 01:00:38,303
Of course.

1116
01:00:38,343 --> 01:00:40,538
It was just a matter of time
before Hollywood realized...

1117
01:00:40,578 --> 01:00:43,206
that adolescent wish fulfillment
was the way to go.

1118
01:00:43,247 --> 01:00:44,475
Thanks, sweetie.

1119
01:00:44,515 --> 01:00:46,039
I'm in
the agent training program.

1120
01:00:46,084 --> 01:00:47,949
I heard he got half a mil.

1121
01:00:47,986 --> 01:00:51,888
- For a first spec script?
- Not bad.

1122
01:00:51,923 --> 01:00:53,788
Is it Duane or Wayne?

1123
01:00:53,825 --> 01:00:56,885
Who the fuck are these people?

1124
01:00:56,928 --> 01:00:58,520
I think she's on TV.

1125
01:00:58,563 --> 01:01:00,030
Oh, yeah.

1126
01:01:00,064 --> 01:01:02,089
I never slept with a girl
that's been on TV.

1127
01:01:02,133 --> 01:01:06,160
That girl on "Jeopardy!"
What was her name?

1128
01:01:06,204 --> 01:01:08,764
That was after we broke up.

1129
01:01:08,806 --> 01:01:10,865
- I'm Sid.
- Amy.

1130
01:01:10,908 --> 01:01:12,705
Hi, Amy. How you doing?

1131
01:01:12,744 --> 01:01:15,372
I just...

1132
01:01:15,413 --> 01:01:17,779
You know how
when you're at a party...

1133
01:01:17,815 --> 01:01:20,409
you go from pocket
to pocket of people?

1134
01:01:20,451 --> 01:01:22,783
You don't know these people.

1135
01:01:22,820 --> 01:01:24,219
So I'm just hanging around,

1136
01:01:24,255 --> 01:01:25,882
waiting for a hole
in the conversation.

1137
01:01:25,923 --> 01:01:28,153
And you had to listen to how
I met my husband.

1138
01:01:28,192 --> 01:01:31,389
No. I'm glad to hear about
how you met your ex-husband.

1139
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:44,540
We should get the guys
together and go to Vegas.

1140
01:01:44,575 --> 01:01:47,100
- I'm serious.
- You'd want Duane to pay.

1141
01:01:47,145 --> 01:01:48,407
He would spring for it.

1142
01:01:48,446 --> 01:01:49,970
You just use your friends.

1143
01:01:50,014 --> 01:01:52,073
Don't you feel bad about
using your friends like that?

1144
01:01:52,116 --> 01:01:54,311
We would all be able to go.
We'd have a great time.

1145
01:01:54,352 --> 01:01:55,910
Duane's made out of money now.

1146
01:01:55,953 --> 01:01:59,116
Let's just sap him
for everything he's worth?

1147
01:01:59,157 --> 01:02:01,216
The girl's a great part.

1148
01:02:01,259 --> 01:02:03,159
Yeah, I actually wrote it...

1149
01:02:03,194 --> 01:02:06,789
as sort of a cross between
my wife and Betty Rubble.

1150
01:02:06,831 --> 01:02:08,924
- Really?
- No, it's true.

1151
01:02:08,966 --> 01:02:12,367
I want to ask you something
about what you were saying.

1152
01:02:12,403 --> 01:02:14,598
Is that like...
Is that ancient history...

1153
01:02:14,639 --> 01:02:16,539
or is that recent history?

1154
01:02:16,574 --> 01:02:18,735
- Do you need help?
- No, no.

1155
01:02:18,776 --> 01:02:21,574
I'm actually... Ancient enough.

1156
01:02:21,612 --> 01:02:24,843
Do I have to mingle,
or are you coming back?

1157
01:02:28,453 --> 01:02:31,320
You're really tan.

1158
01:02:31,355 --> 01:02:33,186
You go to the beach a lot?

1159
01:02:33,224 --> 01:02:35,021
Yeah, I do.

1160
01:02:35,059 --> 01:02:39,325
Out of curiosity,
do you shave or wax your legs?

1161
01:02:39,363 --> 01:02:40,728
I wax.

1162
01:02:40,765 --> 01:02:43,359
- Really?
- Yes.

1163
01:02:43,401 --> 01:02:46,063
Bikini line?

1164
01:02:46,104 --> 01:02:49,096
I wax my bikini line, yes.

1165
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:51,734
Did you ever think,
what the fuck...

1166
01:02:51,776 --> 01:02:55,439
and just wax it all off?

1167
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:57,141
Actually, you know what?

1168
01:02:57,181 --> 01:03:00,480
That would be painful.

1169
01:03:00,518 --> 01:03:04,511
But I do shave the actual area
to get that kind of...

1170
01:03:04,555 --> 01:03:07,922
smooth effect.
You know what I mean?

1171
01:03:07,959 --> 01:03:10,826
Does that make you
uncomfortable?

1172
01:03:10,862 --> 01:03:12,955
No.

1173
01:03:12,997 --> 01:03:16,228
It's kind of
an odd question, really.

1174
01:03:16,267 --> 01:03:17,791
What makes the script so good...

1175
01:03:17,835 --> 01:03:20,668
is that it's the woman's movie,
yet it's still manly.

1176
01:03:20,705 --> 01:03:22,570
I'm a little new at
this script analysis stuff,

1177
01:03:22,607 --> 01:03:24,165
but I think your husband
has something that...

1178
01:03:24,208 --> 01:03:25,539
Could you excuse me
for a minute?

1179
01:03:25,576 --> 01:03:27,373
Sure. I'll talk to you later.

1180
01:03:27,411 --> 01:03:29,538
Haven't they locked you up yet?

1181
01:03:29,580 --> 01:03:32,276
It's good to see you, too,
Deborah.

1182
01:03:32,316 --> 01:03:35,251
Frank, I realize
that crashing parties...

1183
01:03:35,286 --> 01:03:37,618
is the only thing you have
for a social life,

1184
01:03:37,655 --> 01:03:38,849
but not tonight.

1185
01:03:38,890 --> 01:03:41,188
I came to congratulate
my friend...

1186
01:03:41,225 --> 01:03:44,717
and to give him this.
Is that OK with you?

1187
01:03:44,762 --> 01:03:47,322
It's a nice bottle.
Thanks, Frank.

1188
01:03:47,365 --> 01:03:50,266
I'm sure
Duane will appreciate it.

1189
01:03:50,301 --> 01:03:51,598
Drive safely now, OK?

1190
01:03:51,636 --> 01:03:53,297
Did I do something to you?

1191
01:03:53,337 --> 01:03:57,068
Get some help, Frank.
She's married.

1192
01:03:57,108 --> 01:03:59,338
Have a nice party, Deborah.

1193
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:04,472
Bye, Frank.

1194
01:04:08,152 --> 01:04:09,847
What's the film about?
What's it really about?

1195
01:04:09,887 --> 01:04:11,286
What genre
does it take place in?

1196
01:04:11,322 --> 01:04:14,189
What, the spine?
Like one sentence?

1197
01:04:14,225 --> 01:04:16,887
"Boy meets girl".
I don't give a shit about that.

1198
01:04:16,928 --> 01:04:18,589
Fuck "Boy meets girl"
Fuck "Motorcycle movie".

1199
01:04:18,629 --> 01:04:20,859
No. What is really being said?

1200
01:04:20,898 --> 01:04:22,331
That's what
you were talking about.

1201
01:04:22,366 --> 01:04:24,698
The whole idea, man,
is subversion -

1202
01:04:24,735 --> 01:04:26,965
you want subversion
on a massive level.

1203
01:04:27,004 --> 01:04:28,869
You know what one of
the greatest fucking scripts...

1204
01:04:28,906 --> 01:04:30,965
ever written in the history
of Hollywood is?

1205
01:04:31,008 --> 01:04:32,703
- What?
- "Top Gun".

1206
01:04:32,743 --> 01:04:35,405
- Come on.
- "Top Gun" is fucking great.

1207
01:04:35,446 --> 01:04:38,711
What is "Top Gun"? A story about
a bunch of fighter pilots?

1208
01:04:38,749 --> 01:04:41,775
It's about a bunch of guys
waving their dicks around.

1209
01:04:41,819 --> 01:04:44,185
It is a story
about a man's struggle...

1210
01:04:44,222 --> 01:04:46,417
with his own homosexuality.

1211
01:04:46,457 --> 01:04:48,891
I'm serious.
That is what "Top Gun" is about.

1212
01:04:48,926 --> 01:04:50,826
You've got Maverick, all right?

1213
01:04:50,861 --> 01:04:52,021
He's on the edge, man.

1214
01:04:52,063 --> 01:04:53,928
He's right on the fucking line.

1215
01:04:53,965 --> 01:04:56,456
And you got
Iceman and all his crew.

1216
01:04:56,500 --> 01:04:59,765
They're gay.
They represent the gay man.

1217
01:04:59,804 --> 01:05:02,102
And they're saying,
"Go the gay way".

1218
01:05:02,139 --> 01:05:03,663
He could go both ways.

1219
01:05:03,708 --> 01:05:06,609
- What about Kelly McGillis?
- She's heterosexuality.

1220
01:05:06,644 --> 01:05:08,942
She's saying, "No, no, no.
Go the normal way."

1221
01:05:08,980 --> 01:05:10,675
"Play by the rules.
Go the normal way".

1222
01:05:10,715 --> 01:05:12,342
And they're saying,
"No. Go the gay way.

1223
01:05:12,383 --> 01:05:14,078
"Be the gay way.
Go for the gay way".

1224
01:05:14,118 --> 01:05:16,484
That is what's going on
throughout that whole movie.

1225
01:05:16,520 --> 01:05:18,818
What is this party?
Who are these people?

1226
01:05:18,856 --> 01:05:21,290
They make me sick. What is that?

1227
01:05:21,325 --> 01:05:25,421
Who are you? What is he wearing?

1228
01:05:25,463 --> 01:05:30,730
It's some dance jumpsuit,
freakish little gaucho...

1229
01:05:30,768 --> 01:05:34,864
"Let's go to Spain and dance
with our arms over our heads".

1230
01:05:34,905 --> 01:05:36,338
He goes to her house, right?

1231
01:05:36,374 --> 01:05:37,841
It looks like
they're going to have sex.

1232
01:05:37,875 --> 01:05:39,843
They're sitting back.
He's taking a shower.

1233
01:05:39,877 --> 01:05:41,003
They don't have sex.

1234
01:05:41,045 --> 01:05:42,376
He gets on the motorcycle,
drives away.

1235
01:05:42,413 --> 01:05:44,381
She's like, "What the fuck
is going on here?"

1236
01:05:44,415 --> 01:05:48,181
Next scene you see her,
she's in the elevator.

1237
01:05:48,219 --> 01:05:49,481
She is dressed like a guy!

1238
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:52,455
She's got the cap on,
the aviator glasses,

1239
01:05:52,490 --> 01:05:55,254
she's wearing the same jacket
that the Iceman wears.

1240
01:05:55,293 --> 01:05:57,193
She says, "This is
how I'm going to get this guy."

1241
01:05:57,228 --> 01:05:58,627
"This guy's going towards
the gay way.

1242
01:05:58,663 --> 01:06:00,927
"So I gotta bring him back
from the gay way.

1243
01:06:00,965 --> 01:06:02,660
"So I'll do that
through subterfuge.

1244
01:06:02,700 --> 01:06:04,190
"I'll dress like a man".

1245
01:06:04,235 --> 01:06:08,194
That is how she approaches it.

1246
01:06:08,239 --> 01:06:12,175
Let me ask you - if I may digress
for two seconds here...

1247
01:06:12,209 --> 01:06:14,177
I met this girl Amy here.

1248
01:06:14,211 --> 01:06:16,008
She's floating around here
and everything.

1249
01:06:16,047 --> 01:06:18,015
She just got divorced, right?

1250
01:06:18,049 --> 01:06:21,177
I saw you on... What was it?

1251
01:06:21,218 --> 01:06:22,583
I was asking my friend.

1252
01:06:22,620 --> 01:06:24,212
I can't remember.

1253
01:06:24,255 --> 01:06:25,916
You know...

1254
01:06:25,956 --> 01:06:28,322
There's just a little...

1255
01:06:33,631 --> 01:06:35,121
I'm... I'm lucky.

1256
01:06:35,166 --> 01:06:36,724
We're going to drink
a pot of coffee...

1257
01:06:36,767 --> 01:06:38,735
and then drive to Vegas.
You want to go?

1258
01:06:38,769 --> 01:06:41,431
- What's her problem?
- She doesn't want to go.

1259
01:06:41,472 --> 01:06:43,599
She doesn't like to gamble.

1260
01:07:02,360 --> 01:07:04,521
- Hang on.
- Sorry.

1261
01:07:18,442 --> 01:07:20,410
We need to have a little talk.

1262
01:07:20,444 --> 01:07:23,470
I know, but this
really isn't the best time.

1263
01:07:23,514 --> 01:07:25,414
Is this inconvenient for you?

1264
01:07:25,449 --> 01:07:26,780
I could leave if you'd like.

1265
01:07:26,817 --> 01:07:30,719
- I'll call you.
- Should I come back? OK.

1266
01:07:30,755 --> 01:07:32,017
What are you doing?

1267
01:07:32,056 --> 01:07:34,581
You answer me one thing.
Right now.

1268
01:07:34,625 --> 01:07:36,923
Maybe it was my imagination,
or maybe I dreamt it,

1269
01:07:36,961 --> 01:07:38,519
but was it not
exactly six days ago...

1270
01:07:38,562 --> 01:07:39,961
that we made
the most incredible love...

1271
01:07:39,997 --> 01:07:41,487
and you told me
that you loved me?

1272
01:07:41,532 --> 01:07:43,022
Was it or not?

1273
01:07:44,301 --> 01:07:45,598
Sarah, how's it going?

1274
01:07:45,636 --> 01:07:46,796
- Hi.
- You having a good time?

1275
01:07:46,837 --> 01:07:48,498
Oh, yeah.

1276
01:07:48,539 --> 01:07:50,871
Can I double-check
something with you?

1277
01:07:50,908 --> 01:07:53,843
Do you see anything in my teeth?

1278
01:07:55,312 --> 01:07:57,212
No.

1279
01:07:57,248 --> 01:08:00,308
I didn't, either.
Nice schmooze-fest, huh?

1280
01:08:02,119 --> 01:08:03,450
Is everything OK?

1281
01:08:03,487 --> 01:08:06,718
Great. I'm just hanging.

1282
01:08:06,757 --> 01:08:09,817
Oh, OK.

1283
01:08:09,860 --> 01:08:11,487
- All right.
- Yeah.

1284
01:08:11,529 --> 01:08:14,862
- See you later.
- OK. Bye, Rory.

1285
01:08:14,899 --> 01:08:16,958
Bye.

1286
01:08:18,669 --> 01:08:20,762
You have to go now.

1287
01:08:20,805 --> 01:08:24,036
Did it happen or not?

1288
01:08:24,074 --> 01:08:25,735
It happened.

1289
01:08:25,776 --> 01:08:27,038
Well, thank God,

1290
01:08:27,077 --> 01:08:30,012
because I was starting
to think I went insane.

1291
01:08:30,047 --> 01:08:33,073
I told you I need some time.

1292
01:08:34,485 --> 01:08:37,921
Sarah, it doesn't take six days
to pack your bags.

1293
01:08:37,955 --> 01:08:39,650
It does if
you keep unpacking them.

1294
01:08:39,690 --> 01:08:41,021
It's right through there.

1295
01:08:43,294 --> 01:08:44,488
You waiting?

1296
01:08:44,528 --> 01:08:46,689
Waiting? Yeah!

1297
01:08:46,730 --> 01:08:50,063
And after that,
I'm going back into the party...

1298
01:08:50,100 --> 01:08:53,536
and I'm not going
to talk to you again tonight.

1299
01:08:53,571 --> 01:08:56,540
OK.

1300
01:08:56,574 --> 01:08:58,064
Do I know you?

1301
01:08:59,743 --> 01:09:01,233
No.

1302
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:04,178
OK.

1303
01:09:09,453 --> 01:09:11,216
Yeah.

1304
01:09:11,255 --> 01:09:13,348
Yeah, I'm still here.

1305
01:09:13,390 --> 01:09:17,383
Jesus Christ! God!

1306
01:09:19,263 --> 01:09:22,232
There's a man with a beard
coming through the window!

1307
01:09:22,266 --> 01:09:26,930
Jesus! Jesus Christ! No, I'm...

1308
01:09:26,971 --> 01:09:29,405
Sarah,
I'm not leaving without you.

1309
01:09:29,440 --> 01:09:31,533
Dennis Hopper just climbed
through the window.

1310
01:09:31,575 --> 01:09:34,840
- You can't keep doing this!
- Doing what?

1311
01:09:34,879 --> 01:09:37,279
Hiding the fact that your
marriage is a piece of paper...

1312
01:09:37,314 --> 01:09:39,145
and you and I
are flesh and blood!

1313
01:09:39,183 --> 01:09:40,650
This is something
out of "Fatal Attraction".

1314
01:09:40,684 --> 01:09:42,777
No. There's this weird woman
in the bathroom.

1315
01:09:42,820 --> 01:09:44,788
Excuse me, but could you
take that outside?

1316
01:09:44,822 --> 01:09:46,881
I'm waiting
to go to the bathroom.

1317
01:09:46,924 --> 01:09:50,257
- Could you please get out?
- Out! Come here.

1318
01:09:50,294 --> 01:09:52,387
Thank you very, very much!

1319
01:09:52,429 --> 01:09:54,624
Look, come here.

1320
01:09:54,665 --> 01:09:56,633
What the hell's the matter
with you?

1321
01:09:56,667 --> 01:09:59,966
Yeah, OK, so we slept together.

1322
01:10:00,004 --> 01:10:03,167
It was great,
but that doesn't mean...

1323
01:10:03,207 --> 01:10:05,971
it wasn't a huge mistake,
you know?

1324
01:10:06,010 --> 01:10:07,534
That's what you call it?
A mistake?

1325
01:10:07,578 --> 01:10:10,012
Look at us right now.
We're in Duane's bathroom,

1326
01:10:10,047 --> 01:10:11,947
at a party
you weren't invited to.

1327
01:10:11,982 --> 01:10:13,882
I think this qualifies
as a mistake.

1328
01:10:13,918 --> 01:10:15,044
Then why did you sleep with me?

1329
01:10:15,085 --> 01:10:17,553
Why did you tell me
about the green umbrella?

1330
01:10:17,588 --> 01:10:18,748
You asked me about it.

1331
01:10:18,789 --> 01:10:21,121
No, you forced me to.
And you want to know what?

1332
01:10:21,158 --> 01:10:23,285
We aren't talking about
your umbrella or Joe's umbrella.

1333
01:10:23,327 --> 01:10:24,988
We're talking about
my fucking umbrella.

1334
01:10:25,029 --> 01:10:28,692
And it wasn't even my umbrella.
It belonged to my friend.

1335
01:10:28,732 --> 01:10:30,495
I don't give a shit
about the umbrella!

1336
01:10:30,534 --> 01:10:33,594
I'm in love with you.
Don't you understand that?

1337
01:10:33,637 --> 01:10:34,831
That doesn't give you
the license...

1338
01:10:34,872 --> 01:10:36,567
to do any stupid thing
that comes into your head.

1339
01:10:36,607 --> 01:10:38,438
This is not stupid.

1340
01:10:41,078 --> 01:10:45,242
I just... I'm sorry.

1341
01:10:45,282 --> 01:10:48,513
I want to kiss you
without feeling guilty.

1342
01:10:48,552 --> 01:10:50,076
You know?

1343
01:10:51,689 --> 01:10:54,317
All right. Fair enough.

1344
01:10:54,358 --> 01:10:57,691
How much time do you need?

1345
01:10:57,728 --> 01:11:00,526
Would you go away?

1346
01:11:00,564 --> 01:11:02,191
Honey?

1347
01:11:04,568 --> 01:11:07,002
I'm sorry. I thought
you were the phone guy.

1348
01:11:07,037 --> 01:11:10,939
I'll be right out.

1349
01:11:12,176 --> 01:11:14,337
Honey, I want to get out
of here pretty soon.

1350
01:11:14,378 --> 01:11:18,041
I'll meet you at the front door
in a few minutes.

1351
01:11:19,550 --> 01:11:21,177
Are you all right?

1352
01:11:21,218 --> 01:11:24,949
Yeah, I'm fine. I...

1353
01:11:24,989 --> 01:11:27,890
I'm fine. I just...
I have a little...

1354
01:11:27,925 --> 01:11:29,916
Could you have Deborah
come here?

1355
01:11:29,960 --> 01:11:31,928
Honey, what's going on?

1356
01:11:31,962 --> 01:11:35,489
It's a woman thing, honey.
You don't want to know.

1357
01:11:36,834 --> 01:11:38,131
OK.

1358
01:11:38,168 --> 01:11:39,533
OK.

1359
01:11:49,113 --> 01:11:50,978
You've got to get out.

1360
01:11:51,015 --> 01:11:52,380
Where am I going to go?

1361
01:11:54,551 --> 01:11:57,714
Get in. Get back in there!

1362
01:12:06,964 --> 01:12:08,932
- Hello?
- Hi.

1363
01:12:08,966 --> 01:12:11,093
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

1364
01:12:14,338 --> 01:12:16,533
- Frank?
- Yeah.

1365
01:12:19,843 --> 01:12:21,708
Frank, come out here.

1366
01:12:23,047 --> 01:12:24,537
Frank!

1367
01:12:32,189 --> 01:12:34,987
Frank,
go out the way you came in.

1368
01:12:35,025 --> 01:12:37,323
I'll call you.

1369
01:12:38,962 --> 01:12:40,224
Thanks for having me.

1370
01:12:40,264 --> 01:12:42,494
Thanks for stopping by.

1371
01:12:42,533 --> 01:12:45,127
Are you OK?

1372
01:12:45,169 --> 01:12:47,296
Yeah.

1373
01:12:47,337 --> 01:12:49,328
Fuck, I don't know what I am.

1374
01:12:49,373 --> 01:12:51,034
Hi.

1375
01:12:54,411 --> 01:12:55,969
What's happening?

1376
01:12:56,013 --> 01:12:59,449
My life is fucked.

1377
01:12:59,483 --> 01:13:00,677
But the real ending
of the movie...

1378
01:13:00,718 --> 01:13:02,618
is when they fight the MIGs
at the end.

1379
01:13:02,653 --> 01:13:04,780
Because he has passed over
into the gay way.

1380
01:13:04,822 --> 01:13:07,586
They are this gay
fighting fucking force,

1381
01:13:07,624 --> 01:13:10,457
and they're
beating the Russians.

1382
01:13:10,494 --> 01:13:12,724
And it's over,
and they fucking land,

1383
01:13:12,763 --> 01:13:15,459
and Iceman's been trying
to get Maverick the entire time.

1384
01:13:15,499 --> 01:13:17,091
Finally, he's got him,
all right?

1385
01:13:17,134 --> 01:13:19,466
What is the last fucking line
that they have together?

1386
01:13:19,503 --> 01:13:21,630
They're all hugging
and kissing and happy,

1387
01:13:21,672 --> 01:13:23,765
and Ice comes up to Maverick,
and he says...

1388
01:13:23,807 --> 01:13:27,607
"Man, you can
ride my tail anytime"!

1389
01:13:27,644 --> 01:13:29,134
And what does Maverick say?

1390
01:13:29,179 --> 01:13:31,272
"You can ride mine"!

1391
01:13:31,315 --> 01:13:35,718
Sword fight! Sword fight!

1392
01:13:35,753 --> 01:13:39,018
- Fucking "A," man!
- Yeah!

1393
01:13:58,142 --> 01:14:01,600
Jesus Christ!
You scared the shit out of me.

1394
01:14:01,645 --> 01:14:04,136
I thought this was your car.

1395
01:14:04,181 --> 01:14:07,207
I didn't see you at the party.

1396
01:14:09,486 --> 01:14:12,785
Deborah wouldn't let me in.

1397
01:14:12,823 --> 01:14:15,018
Really?

1398
01:14:15,058 --> 01:14:16,855
Yeah.

1399
01:14:16,894 --> 01:14:18,452
I love Deborah.

1400
01:14:19,763 --> 01:14:24,257
She's a little abrasive
sometimes, don't you think?

1401
01:14:24,301 --> 01:14:25,700
Yeah.

1402
01:14:28,372 --> 01:14:30,397
I wonder how
Duane puts up with her.

1403
01:14:30,440 --> 01:14:33,068
Yeah, or how
she puts up with him, huh?

1404
01:14:33,110 --> 01:14:37,604
Yeah. They're married.

1405
01:14:38,882 --> 01:14:45,617
That's part of
what marriage is - putting up.

1406
01:14:48,725 --> 01:14:51,819
No, thanks. I got my own.

1407
01:14:55,332 --> 01:14:58,062
To old friends.

1408
01:15:11,882 --> 01:15:14,442
Your car needs some work, man.

1409
01:15:14,484 --> 01:15:17,282
Yeah, it could definitely use
a new interior.

1410
01:15:17,321 --> 01:15:20,654
You never knew how
to take care of your stuff, man.

1411
01:15:24,361 --> 01:15:26,420
Well, I...

1412
01:15:28,999 --> 01:15:31,524
What about that...

1413
01:15:31,568 --> 01:15:33,798
that motorcycle you had...

1414
01:15:33,837 --> 01:15:39,104
with the little speakers on it
and the fuzzy seats?

1415
01:15:41,144 --> 01:15:43,442
That thing was trashed.

1416
01:15:45,716 --> 01:15:46,910
Yeah.

1417
01:15:46,950 --> 01:15:50,010
- What was it like?
- What?

1418
01:15:51,755 --> 01:15:53,780
Sleeping with my wife.

1419
01:15:55,926 --> 01:15:58,156
Huh?

1420
01:16:00,998 --> 01:16:02,625
Huh?

1421
01:16:04,167 --> 01:16:06,260
What was it like?

1422
01:16:08,138 --> 01:16:09,969
It's OK, man. She told me.

1423
01:16:10,007 --> 01:16:12,601
I just want
to know what it was like.

1424
01:16:15,812 --> 01:16:17,006
I'm in love with her, Joseph.

1425
01:16:17,047 --> 01:16:19,572
I know that.

1426
01:16:19,616 --> 01:16:22,710
You've made that
abundantly clear.

1427
01:16:26,590 --> 01:16:28,217
I should have told you...

1428
01:16:28,258 --> 01:16:30,783
No, you should not have
fucked her!

1429
01:16:30,827 --> 01:16:32,192
That's what
you shouldn't have done!

1430
01:16:32,229 --> 01:16:34,595
I didn't fuck her.
I made love to her.

1431
01:16:34,631 --> 01:16:36,121
- Really?
- Yes.

1432
01:16:36,166 --> 01:16:37,895
So sweet. Why don't you
shut up for a minute?

1433
01:16:37,935 --> 01:16:40,267
Why don't you shut up?

1434
01:16:40,304 --> 01:16:42,670
I'm not the only one involved.
It was her choice!

1435
01:16:42,706 --> 01:16:44,674
Really? Is that so?

1436
01:16:44,708 --> 01:16:46,573
I seem to remember
her choosing me,

1437
01:16:46,610 --> 01:16:47,810
but maybe I got it wrong here.

1438
01:16:47,844 --> 01:16:50,039
Maybe I should
go ask her right now.

1439
01:16:50,080 --> 01:16:52,173
Why do you want
to make a big show of this?

1440
01:16:52,215 --> 01:16:54,149
Maybe I should go ask her.
We're all here.

1441
01:16:54,184 --> 01:16:58,177
We can fucking get this out
right now, all right?

1442
01:16:58,221 --> 01:16:59,848
Joseph!

1443
01:16:59,890 --> 01:17:02,324
Joseph, Joseph.

1444
01:17:02,359 --> 01:17:03,656
What are you doing?

1445
01:17:03,694 --> 01:17:06,128
Were you able
to stop yourself, Frank?

1446
01:17:08,899 --> 01:17:11,094
- Sarah?
- This isn't going to help.

1447
01:17:11,134 --> 01:17:12,999
- Joe.
- Sarah?

1448
01:17:13,036 --> 01:17:15,300
It's your
lawful-wedded husband here!

1449
01:17:15,339 --> 01:17:16,704
I think it's time
we had a little talk!

1450
01:17:16,740 --> 01:17:17,968
Get the fuck off!

1451
01:17:18,008 --> 01:17:20,636
Sarah,
get your little ass out here!

1452
01:17:20,677 --> 01:17:22,235
Kick his ass!

1453
01:17:22,279 --> 01:17:24,804
Stop it! What are you doing?

1454
01:17:24,848 --> 01:17:28,443
Stop it. What's your problem?
Do you have something...

1455
01:17:28,485 --> 01:17:30,976
Frank over here informed me
that you chose him,

1456
01:17:31,021 --> 01:17:32,454
which I find
a little confusing...

1457
01:17:32,489 --> 01:17:33,717
because I seem to remember
you marrying me,

1458
01:17:33,757 --> 01:17:35,850
but apparently he was
the last one to fuck you,

1459
01:17:35,892 --> 01:17:38,360
so maybe I'm wrong!

1460
01:17:39,529 --> 01:17:41,520
Take it home, guy.

1461
01:17:41,565 --> 01:17:46,264
In case anybody didn't get that,
my husband over here...

1462
01:17:46,303 --> 01:17:48,328
wants to know why
I fucked Frank over here.

1463
01:17:48,372 --> 01:17:50,966
He seems to think
that if he humiliates me,

1464
01:17:51,008 --> 01:17:53,806
it will put me in
my fucking little place.

1465
01:17:53,844 --> 01:17:55,402
But what
you don't understand, buddy,

1466
01:17:55,445 --> 01:17:58,380
is I don't give a fuck,
because as far as I'm concerned,

1467
01:17:58,415 --> 01:18:00,110
this marriage is over!

1468
01:18:03,353 --> 01:18:04,911
Happy now?

1469
01:18:06,990 --> 01:18:09,618
What about you?
Isn't this what you wanted?

1470
01:18:09,659 --> 01:18:11,524
What do you think?

1471
01:18:11,561 --> 01:18:13,893
Then who the hell's happy here?

1472
01:18:13,930 --> 01:18:15,227
What, is it you?

1473
01:18:15,265 --> 01:18:17,233
Frank, are you
the happy guy here?

1474
01:18:17,267 --> 01:18:19,667
Right. I'm sorry.
You happened to fall in love.

1475
01:18:19,703 --> 01:18:21,227
I don't want
to stand in the way...

1476
01:18:21,271 --> 01:18:23,034
of my two best friends
falling in love,

1477
01:18:23,073 --> 01:18:25,166
so you guys go off
and live happily ever after.

1478
01:18:25,208 --> 01:18:28,541
Joseph, fuck you. I married you.

1479
01:18:28,578 --> 01:18:30,773
Then why did you fuck him?

1480
01:18:30,814 --> 01:18:34,614
What about that fucking slut
you left that party with?

1481
01:18:34,651 --> 01:18:36,983
Listen to me.
I did not fuck her.

1482
01:18:37,020 --> 01:18:39,614
I could have, but I didn't.

1483
01:18:42,893 --> 01:18:44,690
Give me the keys.

1484
01:18:46,229 --> 01:18:47,753
What?

1485
01:18:47,798 --> 01:18:49,163
It's my car. Give me the keys.

1486
01:18:49,199 --> 01:18:51,463
We're starting
the distribution of property?

1487
01:18:51,501 --> 01:18:54,436
Give me the fucking keys!

1488
01:18:54,471 --> 01:18:55,699
Honey, where are you going?

1489
01:18:55,739 --> 01:18:57,400
Wherever the fuck I want!

1490
01:18:57,441 --> 01:19:01,639
- Sarah!
- Frank, I'm sorry.

1491
01:19:01,678 --> 01:19:05,114
This isn't me, you know.
You did this!

1492
01:19:15,725 --> 01:19:17,215
I'm sorry, Joe.

1493
01:19:18,728 --> 01:19:21,697
That's really special, Frank.
You fuck my wife,

1494
01:19:21,731 --> 01:19:23,130
ruin my marriage, she dumps you,

1495
01:19:23,166 --> 01:19:25,726
but the important thing
is that you feel bad.

1496
01:19:31,174 --> 01:19:33,074
She stopped at the light.

1497
01:19:50,093 --> 01:19:52,084
You son of a bitch.

1498
01:20:09,146 --> 01:20:10,613
Sarah!

1499
01:20:13,049 --> 01:20:14,710
Oh, God.

1500
01:20:22,526 --> 01:20:23,857
Get in.

1501
01:20:42,979 --> 01:20:46,779
Do you ever think that we have
too much time on our hands?

1502
01:20:46,816 --> 01:20:48,249
With all the advances
we've made...

1503
01:20:48,285 --> 01:20:50,185
in extending
the human life span...

1504
01:20:50,220 --> 01:20:53,451
that perhaps
nature's cruelest irony...

1505
01:20:53,490 --> 01:20:57,688
is that we get progressively
stupider and stupider...

1506
01:20:57,727 --> 01:21:00,252
with each passing generation?

1507
01:21:00,297 --> 01:21:05,030
Someday,
we'll live for 300 years...

1508
01:21:05,068 --> 01:21:09,835
but we won't be able
to sit still for five seconds.

1509
01:21:12,776 --> 01:21:14,573
Just a thought.
