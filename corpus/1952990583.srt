1
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,370
This is Berk, boasting the kind
of balmy, fun-in-the-sun climate

2
00:00:19,471 --> 00:00:22,156
that will give you frostbite on your spleen.

3
00:00:22,257 --> 00:00:25,242
The one upside is our annual holiday.

4
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:27,662
We call it Snoggletog.

5
00:00:27,763 --> 00:00:30,765
Why we chose such a stupid
name remains a mystery.

6
00:00:30,866 --> 00:00:33,701
But with the war long over...

7
00:00:33,969 --> 00:00:37,472
...and dragons living amongst
us, this year's Snoggletog...

8
00:00:39,208 --> 00:00:41,943
...promises to be one to remember.

9
00:00:42,044 --> 00:00:44,446
OK, OK! I'm coming!

10
00:00:52,003 --> 00:00:54,572
Good morning, Mr. Bossy.

11
00:00:56,708 --> 00:01:00,962
Do you always have to
wake me up so early to go flying...?

12
00:01:01,797 --> 00:01:04,065
Stupid leg.

13
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:06,301
Thanks, buddy. I'm OK.

14
00:01:06,402 --> 00:01:08,369
Yeah, we can go flying now.

15
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:11,172
Eww! Eww!
What?! Eww!

16
00:01:11,273 --> 00:01:13,341
Toothless!

17
00:01:16,328 --> 00:01:19,247
Come on!
Let's see what you got today!

18
00:01:24,886 --> 00:01:27,255
Yeah! OK, you ready?

19
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:30,208
Easy...

20
00:01:34,746 --> 00:01:37,114
Yes! Finally!

21
00:01:38,533 --> 00:01:41,785
Yes, yes... No, no!
That one a wee bit higher!

22
00:01:41,886 --> 00:01:45,606
- Here?
- There! That's the spot!

23
00:01:45,707 --> 00:01:46,974
Roar!

24
00:01:50,945 --> 00:01:52,880
Attaboy, Meatlug.

25
00:01:53,532 --> 00:01:55,049
Are you ready, girl?

26
00:01:59,188 --> 00:02:00,638
By Odin's beard, Gobber,

27
00:02:00,739 --> 00:02:03,207
Vikings spending the winter
holiday with dragons!

28
00:02:03,308 --> 00:02:07,111
- What would the fathers say?
- They'd think we'd lost our minds.

29
00:02:07,212 --> 00:02:11,382
Well done!
Well done. All of you!

30
00:02:11,483 --> 00:02:16,253
I never thought I'd live to see this
day: peace on the island of Berk.

31
00:02:16,354 --> 00:02:19,707
This will surely be the greatest
holiday we've ever seen.

32
00:02:22,711 --> 00:02:24,528
What the...?

33
00:02:33,789 --> 00:02:35,906
What in Thor's name?

34
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,278
Come back!
What are you doing?

35
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:43,731
Meatlug!

36
00:02:45,434 --> 00:02:47,551
- What's going on?
- What's happening?

37
00:02:47,653 --> 00:02:48,936
Where's Hiccup?

38
00:02:49,321 --> 00:02:52,473
What do you say, bud?
Wanna go again?

39
00:02:52,574 --> 00:02:54,558
Whoa!

40
00:02:54,659 --> 00:02:56,727
Whoa!

41
00:02:56,745 --> 00:02:59,047
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

42
00:03:01,066 --> 00:03:02,500
Oh, no, my helmet!

43
00:03:05,604 --> 00:03:06,938
Whoa!

44
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:09,740
Toothless!
No, no, no, no! No, no, no!

45
00:03:09,841 --> 00:03:13,644
Whoa, whoa, wait!
Toothless! Stop!

46
00:03:13,745 --> 00:03:15,179
We'll get it later, buddy.

47
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,215
We need to get back
and find out what's going on.

48
00:03:22,187 --> 00:03:24,688
What's the matter?
Where are you going?

49
00:03:24,789 --> 00:03:29,227
No, no, no, don't leave,
Stormfly! Don't go! Please?

50
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:35,049
- Astrid!
- Hiccup! What's going on?

51
00:03:35,233 --> 00:03:37,468
Where are they going?

52
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,488
- Why did they leave?
- What's happening?!

53
00:03:40,589 --> 00:03:41,889
What if they never come back?!

54
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:43,273
- Stop, please!
- Calm down!

55
00:03:43,575 --> 00:03:45,643
Give him a chance to speak!

56
00:03:45,744 --> 00:03:47,711
Hiccup, where are all
of our dragons going?

57
00:03:47,812 --> 00:03:51,582
Dad, I don't know.

58
00:04:06,798 --> 00:04:09,533
Where'd they go?
Snoggletog is ruined!

59
00:04:09,634 --> 00:04:13,504
It's not ruined!
We're Vikings!

60
00:04:13,605 --> 00:04:18,142
We've been perfectly happy celebrating
without dragons for generations.

61
00:04:18,243 --> 00:04:20,778
And there's no reason
we can't do it again.

62
00:04:20,946 --> 00:04:23,247
Now, we don't know
where they've gone off to.

63
00:04:23,348 --> 00:04:26,934
But we have to have faith
that they'll be back again soon.

64
00:04:27,035 --> 00:04:29,737
- Am I right?
- You're right! We are Vikings!

65
00:04:29,755 --> 00:04:33,608
- We're tough...
most of the time.

66
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:37,528
Let's sing some Snoggletog songs.

67
00:04:39,547 --> 00:04:41,448
- That was depressing.
- I know.

68
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:44,451
I was looking forward to spending
the holiday with Stormfly.

69
00:04:46,922 --> 00:04:49,757
What are you so happy about?
Don't you miss Meatlug?

70
00:04:49,858 --> 00:04:51,526
Me?

71
00:04:51,627 --> 00:04:53,761
Oh, yeah.

72
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:57,364
I miss him so much!

73
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,418
Well, good night.

74
00:05:03,672 --> 00:05:07,825
I've got an idea. Let's come up with
a bunch of new holiday traditions.

75
00:05:07,926 --> 00:05:11,596
You know, to bury the sadness.

76
00:05:11,696 --> 00:05:13,664
Actually, Astrid might be onto something.

77
00:05:13,765 --> 00:05:17,468
Easy for you to say. Your dragon
can't go anywhere without you.

78
00:05:20,005 --> 00:05:22,206
Must be nice.

79
00:05:30,115 --> 00:05:32,817
Yak nog! Get your yak nog!

80
00:05:32,918 --> 00:05:36,320
Come on!
Get a frothy, delicious cup of cheer!

81
00:05:36,421 --> 00:05:40,691
Hey, you guys, try this tasty new
beverage I made for the holiday.

82
00:05:40,792 --> 00:05:44,378
- What's the smell? Is that you?
- It's yak nog!

83
00:05:45,664 --> 00:05:48,532
If I drink that, I'm gonna
yak nog all over the place.

84
00:05:48,633 --> 00:05:51,669
Maybe you'd rather taste
a punch in the face?

85
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:55,172
Astrid, it sounds delightful.
I'd love a mug.

86
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:59,910
You can really taste the yak.

87
00:06:00,211 --> 00:06:03,714
- Yum! What is that?
- You wanna try some?

88
00:06:03,815 --> 00:06:05,516
It's my new traditional drink.

89
00:06:05,851 --> 00:06:07,484
Oh, you know, um,

90
00:06:07,585 --> 00:06:11,922
I have suddenly and
inexplicably changed my mind.

91
00:06:12,023 --> 00:06:14,291
Well, you don't know what you're missing.

92
00:06:14,392 --> 00:06:15,860
I bet Hiccup will love this.

93
00:06:15,961 --> 00:06:18,295
Are you crying?

94
00:06:19,748 --> 00:06:23,617
- Hiccup?
- Yeah, I'm over here, Astrid. Coming.

95
00:06:23,718 --> 00:06:26,186
Here. Happy holidays.
From me to you.

96
00:06:26,287 --> 00:06:28,522
- Thank you, milady.
- What are you up to?

97
00:06:28,623 --> 00:06:30,557
OK, you're gonna
think I'm crazy,

98
00:06:30,659 --> 00:06:34,328
but I just couldn't stop thinking
about what Tuffnut said last night.

99
00:06:34,429 --> 00:06:36,831
Toothless can't come
and go like the other dragons,

100
00:06:36,932 --> 00:06:40,033
and that's just not fair.
I was up all night,

101
00:06:40,134 --> 00:06:43,671
and I think I found a way to fix that.

102
00:06:43,772 --> 00:06:46,640
No way!
You built him a new tail?

103
00:06:46,741 --> 00:06:48,943
So he's gonna be able to fly without you!

104
00:06:49,043 --> 00:06:50,210
Mm-hmm.

105
00:06:50,311 --> 00:06:52,863
Wow! What a great gift.

106
00:06:53,815 --> 00:06:55,716
What if he never comes back?

107
00:06:57,285 --> 00:07:00,053
- What am I saying? Of
course he will. - Mm-hmm.

108
00:07:00,154 --> 00:07:05,125
Well, I'm gonna go spread some
more holiday cheer. You're amazing!

109
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:25,529
Toothless! Come on down, bud!
I got something for you.

110
00:07:26,748 --> 00:07:29,250
What do you think of that? Yeah.

111
00:07:30,518 --> 00:07:32,720
Would you just settle down!

112
00:07:32,821 --> 00:07:35,756
Toothless, come on, bud.
Let me get this on you.

113
00:07:35,941 --> 00:07:39,309
Yeah. You are going
to love this.

114
00:07:39,828 --> 00:07:41,279
OK.

115
00:07:42,831 --> 00:07:46,350
No, no, no! Toothless, stop!
Please, wait! Toothless, please!

116
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,358
There you go. See? Got it?

117
00:08:01,266 --> 00:08:03,333
Toothless... Whoa!

118
00:08:35,066 --> 00:08:36,466
Toothless!

119
00:08:36,567 --> 00:08:37,785
I knew you'd come back!

120
00:08:37,886 --> 00:08:39,987
Whoa!

121
00:08:40,989 --> 00:08:42,322
Morning, son.

122
00:08:43,108 --> 00:08:44,892
Hey, Dad.

123
00:08:44,993 --> 00:08:48,679
Glad you're up.
I was looking for your helmet.

124
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:49,864
My... my helmet?

125
00:08:49,965 --> 00:08:52,549
Odin needs a place to put your goodies.

126
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:55,803
Yeah, right, I'll...
get on that.

127
00:08:55,904 --> 00:08:57,237
Great.

128
00:08:58,523 --> 00:08:59,957
Hold on.

129
00:09:01,042 --> 00:09:03,711
Hold on. All right, come on.

130
00:09:03,812 --> 00:09:05,379
What's on your mind?
Out with it.

131
00:09:06,381 --> 00:09:08,866
It's been three days, Dad.

132
00:09:08,967 --> 00:09:11,502
I just thought Toothless
would be back by now.

133
00:09:11,603 --> 00:09:13,570
I'm sure he's with the other dragons.

134
00:09:13,671 --> 00:09:16,090
Yeah?
I wish I could be that sure.

135
00:09:16,191 --> 00:09:21,778
Listen, I know what it's like to miss
someone you love this time of year.

136
00:09:21,879 --> 00:09:25,216
But what do we do when they
can't be here for the holiday?

137
00:09:25,317 --> 00:09:27,117
We celebrate them.

138
00:09:27,219 --> 00:09:31,872
And I imagine that's exactly what
Toothless would want you to do.

139
00:09:31,973 --> 00:09:34,424
- Right?
- You're right.

140
00:09:34,525 --> 00:09:37,161
Good. Now go get that helmet.

141
00:09:37,261 --> 00:09:40,097
We've had enough
disappointment around here.

142
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:54,194
Oh, Fishlegs, you hungry?
There's enough fish there to feed a dragon.

143
00:09:56,915 --> 00:09:59,083
A dragon! That's...

144
00:10:24,826 --> 00:10:26,243
Meatlug!

145
00:10:28,547 --> 00:10:29,730
Whoa!

146
00:10:29,831 --> 00:10:32,366
Hiccup? Where are you going?

147
00:10:32,467 --> 00:10:35,252
I have no idea!

148
00:10:36,087 --> 00:10:39,339
Meatlug!
What about presents?

149
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,725
Hey!

150
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,695
- I can't believe him.
- You can't believe him?!

151
00:10:44,796 --> 00:10:48,098
- You kidnapped your dragon!
- That makes it sound so mean.

152
00:10:48,199 --> 00:10:50,534
- Hey, guys...
- He flew away the second

153
00:10:50,719 --> 00:10:53,003
- he was unleashed!
- I'm 72 percent sure

154
00:10:53,188 --> 00:10:54,421
he wanted to stay.

155
00:10:54,522 --> 00:10:56,356
- Guys!
- Whoa!

156
00:10:56,457 --> 00:10:58,809
Meatlug barfed up a pile of rocks.

157
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:02,513
You're such an idiot. Those aren't
rocks. Your dragon laid eggs!

158
00:11:02,614 --> 00:11:05,115
Hey, wait. I bet that's
why the dragons left.

159
00:11:05,216 --> 00:11:08,335
- To lay their eggs.
- But boy dragons don't lay eggs.

160
00:11:08,436 --> 00:11:11,405
Yeah, your boy dragon
is a girl dragon.

161
00:11:11,506 --> 00:11:13,874
OK!
That actually explains a few things.

162
00:11:13,975 --> 00:11:16,643
Hey!
Everyone's missing their dragons, right?

163
00:11:16,744 --> 00:11:19,096
- Here it comes.
- I've got an idea.

164
00:11:19,197 --> 00:11:22,600
It'll be another new Snoggletog tradition.

165
00:11:23,234 --> 00:11:25,852
This is gonna be so good!

166
00:11:45,974 --> 00:11:48,509
Meatlug, where are you taking me?

167
00:12:24,696 --> 00:12:27,531
You guys come here to have babies.

168
00:12:32,537 --> 00:12:33,854
Whoa.

169
00:12:35,256 --> 00:12:37,557
Hmm.

170
00:12:50,255 --> 00:12:52,206
Aww.

171
00:12:52,307 --> 00:12:54,091
Wow!

172
00:12:57,912 --> 00:13:00,080
Hey, look over here.
You missed one.

173
00:13:00,181 --> 00:13:01,915
Whoa!

174
00:13:08,039 --> 00:13:11,275
Man, it's a good thing
those don't hatch on Berk.

175
00:13:19,651 --> 00:13:21,985
- Wasn't this a great idea?
- Uh-huh!

176
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:24,287
Everyone is gonna be so surprised!

177
00:13:25,373 --> 00:13:26,507
Ow!

178
00:13:26,607 --> 00:13:28,475
Surprise!

179
00:13:30,929 --> 00:13:33,847
Aww!

180
00:13:33,948 --> 00:13:36,316
The eggs explode?

181
00:13:37,786 --> 00:13:40,653
The eggs explode!

182
00:13:43,141 --> 00:13:44,874
Sorry!

183
00:13:45,609 --> 00:13:46,843
Sorry!

184
00:13:51,933 --> 00:13:54,034
Save us!

185
00:13:58,923 --> 00:14:01,474
- Awesome!
- Wow!

186
00:14:01,576 --> 00:14:04,211
This is your best idea yet.

187
00:14:09,634 --> 00:14:12,736
What in Thor's name is going on?!

188
00:14:12,837 --> 00:14:14,871
The eggs explode.

189
00:14:18,143 --> 00:14:19,642
Toothless!

190
00:14:19,743 --> 00:14:21,478
Toothless?

191
00:14:22,713 --> 00:14:25,415
Come on, Toothless, where are you?

192
00:14:31,606 --> 00:14:33,123
Hookfang!

193
00:14:35,009 --> 00:14:36,676
Stormfly.

194
00:14:38,229 --> 00:14:43,250
Oh! You have no idea how happy
I am to see you guys.

195
00:14:44,051 --> 00:14:46,220
And you have... babies?

196
00:14:46,321 --> 00:14:50,391
Look at you guys,
all happy together.

197
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:57,814
Who knew you were leaving to
celebrate your own sort of... holiday?

198
00:14:59,016 --> 00:15:01,485
I should get back
to my holiday.

199
00:15:01,586 --> 00:15:03,487
So, what do you say there,
Hookfang?

200
00:15:03,588 --> 00:15:06,322
Think you can give me
a ride back home?

201
00:15:11,362 --> 00:15:15,599
I'll see you all back on Berk when
you're good and ready. OK, gang?

202
00:15:18,402 --> 00:15:22,889
No, no! No, no, no! I... think I
just started the return migration.

203
00:15:28,846 --> 00:15:30,764
Well, if you insist.

204
00:15:36,705 --> 00:15:38,321
Come on!

205
00:15:42,644 --> 00:15:44,578
Boy, this is never gonna work.

206
00:15:49,951 --> 00:15:52,653
Hold on.
I've got just the thing.

207
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:00,076
Gobber, this is a disaster.

208
00:16:00,177 --> 00:16:02,646
- It's not so bad.
- Not that bad?

209
00:16:02,747 --> 00:16:05,999
The village is destroyed, the
dragons have gone and left us...

210
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:08,702
Let's face it.
This holiday is a complete...

211
00:16:08,803 --> 00:16:11,438
What are these people
looking at?

212
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:15,358
What is that?

213
00:16:22,766 --> 00:16:24,685
It's Hiccup!

214
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,238
And our dragons!

215
00:16:57,401 --> 00:17:00,570
- Welcome back, laddie!
- Good job!

216
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:03,640
Yeah! Whoo-hoo!

217
00:17:12,483 --> 00:17:14,517
Meatlug!

218
00:17:14,618 --> 00:17:18,021
Stormfly!
You're back! Oh!

219
00:17:18,122 --> 00:17:20,557
And there are babies!

220
00:17:20,658 --> 00:17:24,844
- Well done, son.
- Thanks, Dad.

221
00:17:24,945 --> 00:17:28,598
Everyone, grab your dragons!
To the Great Hall!

222
00:17:28,899 --> 00:17:31,001
We finally have something to celebrate.

223
00:17:38,326 --> 00:17:40,877
This is the best holiday ever!

224
00:17:40,978 --> 00:17:44,831
Who's a baby?
Who's a cutie baby?

225
00:17:51,622 --> 00:17:54,857
Hiccup, I know this must
be really hard for you,

226
00:17:54,958 --> 00:17:57,460
seeing everyone with their dragons.

227
00:17:57,562 --> 00:18:00,597
But you really did a wonderful thing!

228
00:18:00,698 --> 00:18:02,399
Thank you.

229
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:07,254
Astrid, where did Toothless go?

230
00:18:07,355 --> 00:18:09,539
I don't know.

231
00:18:17,198 --> 00:18:18,915
Wow. Man!

232
00:18:19,016 --> 00:18:21,150
Wouldn't wanna be you right now.

233
00:18:21,252 --> 00:18:25,655
I mean, you brought back
everyone's dragon except yours.

234
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:29,426
Yeah, you know,
this is not helping at all.

235
00:18:31,829 --> 00:18:34,247
Toothless! Hey, bud!

236
00:18:38,652 --> 00:18:41,137
Stoick.

237
00:18:43,775 --> 00:18:46,192
Bad dragon!
Very bad dragon!

238
00:18:46,293 --> 00:18:48,912
You scared me to death! Don't
ever stay away that long again!

239
00:18:49,013 --> 00:18:51,598
And what is in your mouth?

240
00:18:51,699 --> 00:18:54,201
Eww! Eww!

241
00:18:58,138 --> 00:19:01,508
Yeah, you found my helmet.

242
00:19:01,609 --> 00:19:03,677
Hey!
You found my helmet!

243
00:19:03,944 --> 00:19:06,513
That's where you've been?

244
00:19:06,614 --> 00:19:08,781
Buddy, thank you.

245
00:19:08,883 --> 00:19:10,783
You are amazing.

246
00:19:16,207 --> 00:19:19,876
Happy Snoggletog!

247
00:19:36,344 --> 00:19:39,028
I'm coming, Toothless!

248
00:19:40,264 --> 00:19:42,549
All right, bud,
come on down. I was just...

249
00:19:45,403 --> 00:19:48,521
Toothless, what'd you pull this out
for? You don't need this any more.

250
00:19:48,622 --> 00:19:50,056
Come on, let's get going.

251
00:19:55,012 --> 00:19:59,049
Would you quit fooling around?
You have your new tail now.

252
00:20:00,384 --> 00:20:01,951
Toothless!

253
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:12,562
Toothless! Stop!
What are you doing?!

254
00:20:23,975 --> 00:20:26,526
Winter in Berk lasts most of the year.

255
00:20:26,628 --> 00:20:29,579
It hangs on with both
hands and won't let go.

256
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:32,282
And the only real
comforts against the cold

257
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:34,550
are those you keep close to your heart.

258
00:20:34,651 --> 00:20:36,969
OK, bud, you ready?

259
00:20:39,273 --> 00:20:41,007
Yee-haw!

260
00:20:44,712 --> 00:20:49,065
Turns out that was
the best Snoggletog ever.

261
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:52,953
That year, I gave my best
friend a pretty great gift.

262
00:20:55,472 --> 00:20:57,791
Whoo-hoo!

263
00:21:00,544 --> 00:21:02,862
He gave me a better one.
