1
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:36,684
Win a trip for 12
to anywhere in the free world,

2
00:02:36,756 --> 00:02:40,658
or win a working oil well
and have money flowing in for years.

3
00:02:40,727 --> 00:02:44,424
That's the grand prize
in Dial Soap's big contest.

4
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:47,625
Write a two line jingle starting,
"I'm glad I use Dial..."

5
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,930
The last word in
both lines must rhyme.

6
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:53,302
For example: "I'm glad I use Dial..."

7
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:58,910
How hard is it to put it
across the plate? You idiot.

8
00:02:58,978 --> 00:03:01,503
There once was a time,
believe it or not,

9
00:03:01,581 --> 00:03:04,607
when skill and a
reasonable amount of luck

10
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:08,142
could actually feed a family of 12.

11
00:03:08,221 --> 00:03:11,486
Come on! Strike 'em out,
you dog-faced bastard! Play ball!

12
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:13,685
Contesting, if you haven't heard of it,

13
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,787
was a lucrative way for overworked
housewives to use their underused wits.

14
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:22,828
It wasn't that I was any more gifted
than your average contester,

15
00:03:22,902 --> 00:03:24,870
I was simply more determined.

16
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:28,339
I was so prolific, in fact,
that I borrowed my children's names

17
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:30,399
so I could submit
more than one entry.

18
00:03:30,476 --> 00:03:33,741
This was a perfectly legal tactic
in the contesting world,

19
00:03:33,813 --> 00:03:37,806
and as far as I could see, one of
the advantages of having so many kids.

20
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:47,356
My creative output usually
corresponded directly to our needs.

21
00:03:47,427 --> 00:03:50,260
- Hey, Mom. The toaster's broke.
- Broken.

22
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:52,764
All right. Hold on.

23
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:56,362
"Kraft's Parkay
won't tear fresh bread.

24
00:03:56,436 --> 00:03:59,405
Even ice cold,
it will smoothly spread."

25
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:07,202
- Here you go, honey.
- Thanks, Mom.

26
00:04:08,114 --> 00:04:11,550
Small household adversities
were my steady inspiration.

27
00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:14,712
But whenever fate handed
one of my kids an unfair blow,

28
00:04:14,787 --> 00:04:17,722
it would set my muse on fire.

29
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,663
- Mom.
- What, honey?

30
00:04:25,732 --> 00:04:27,666
The landlord's here.

31
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:30,328
Oh, hello, Mr. Stubbs.
Come on in.

32
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:36,768
- Dad!
- Hey, Dad!

33
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,683
Dad, we're being evicted!

34
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:48,721
- Come on, let me out.
- Dad!

35
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:51,279
- We're being evicted.
- Oh, yeah?

36
00:04:51,357 --> 00:04:53,825
The landlord came by.
He wants the house back.

37
00:04:53,893 --> 00:04:55,724
His daughter's getting married.

38
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:57,854
- How long do we have?
- Three weeks.

39
00:04:58,398 --> 00:05:01,663
- What are we gonna do?
- Don't you worry, sweetheart.

40
00:05:01,734 --> 00:05:04,066
Mom always figures something out.

41
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:06,731
- Do you know the capital of Alaska?
- No.

42
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:09,969
- Juneau... get it?
- Oh, yeah. Good one.

43
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:14,042
- Hello, Mother.
- Hello, Dad. I suppose you heard?

44
00:05:14,113 --> 00:05:17,310
Yep. Can't seem
to catch a break, can we?

45
00:05:18,851 --> 00:05:21,342
Here, I brought you something.

46
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:24,447
- Thank you.
- Don't choke up so much on the bat.

47
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:26,685
- All right, Dad.
- Attaboy.

48
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:54,211
Mom! The men are here to kick us out!

49
00:06:01,094 --> 00:06:02,356
May I help you?

50
00:06:03,796 --> 00:06:05,957
- Mrs. Ryan?
- Yes.

51
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:07,659
Is your son, Dick, here?

52
00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:11,235
This is Dick.
What is this about?

53
00:06:11,304 --> 00:06:13,204
Congratulations, son.

54
00:06:13,272 --> 00:06:15,740
- You've just won $5,000.
- I did?

55
00:06:15,808 --> 00:06:18,504
I'm Mr. Forrest,
this is Mr. Bravey and Mr. Kramer

56
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:20,512
of the Western Auto Supply Company.

57
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:23,413
Out of 65,000 entries
in our national bike contest,

58
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:25,110
you have won the grand prize.

59
00:06:25,184 --> 00:06:28,176
- Oh, my goodness.
- And that's not all.

60
00:06:28,254 --> 00:06:30,688
You've won a brand new
Western Flyer bicycle

61
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:32,782
and a Westinghouse washer and dryer.

62
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:35,419
- A washing machine? Oh, my Lord.
- That's right.

63
00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:38,560
Are you all right?

64
00:06:38,631 --> 00:06:42,067
I just have to sit down
and have myself a happy cry.

65
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:45,533
I love that bike.

66
00:06:45,605 --> 00:06:48,540
Dad! We won!

67
00:06:50,543 --> 00:06:52,977
We won $5,000!

68
00:06:53,045 --> 00:06:55,809
- No kidding.
- Isn't it marvelous?

69
00:06:55,882 --> 00:06:58,976
- It's awesome!
- I told you everything would be OK.

70
00:06:59,051 --> 00:07:01,884
Congratulations, Kelly.
You got quite a wife there.

71
00:07:01,954 --> 00:07:03,581
Yep, looks like she got lucky.

72
00:07:03,656 --> 00:07:06,523
Mom says she's gonna put
the money down on a new house.

73
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:09,026
- Yeah?
- Looks like you got lucky.

74
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:12,895
Oh, now, Kelly was all set to do it,
I just beat him to the punch.

75
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:15,189
Alrighty.

76
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:19,364
Just need you to sign Dick's check over
to Defiance Home Saving and Loan.

77
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,373
- Does it matter which of us?
- No.

78
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,375
Whoever is over 21.

79
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:26,435
Although, you don't look
a day over 19, Mrs. Ryan.

80
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:29,709
Well, in that case, I'd better sign it.

81
00:07:37,924 --> 00:07:39,448
Here you go.

82
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,351
Okey-doke.

83
00:07:42,061 --> 00:07:44,461
And, now the mortgage papers...

84
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:46,725
You need both our signatures, correct?

85
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:48,562
Some married couples do that.

86
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:50,966
But it's really not necessary.

87
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:54,438
And, after all, I'm the guy
who has to pay the mortgage,

88
00:07:54,507 --> 00:07:56,771
seems I'm the only one
who needs to sign it.

89
00:07:56,843 --> 00:07:59,403
And since the bank account's
under my name...

90
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,276
Sure, that's how most folks do it.

91
00:08:01,347 --> 00:08:03,747
Well, that seems right to me.

92
00:08:04,517 --> 00:08:06,815
Well, I guess it's all on me then.

93
00:08:06,886 --> 00:08:09,116
Unless Mother here wants to start...

94
00:08:10,356 --> 00:08:13,883
...punching in at the shop.
- Only if you'll do the ironing.

95
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:17,523
We just need
your John Hancock there.

96
00:08:19,632 --> 00:08:21,293
Ryan.

97
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:25,694
Well, congratulations, Mr. Ryan.

98
00:08:26,205 --> 00:08:28,230
You are a homeowner, sir.

99
00:08:28,307 --> 00:08:29,831
Thank you.

100
00:08:36,282 --> 00:08:38,648
All right, watch that curb.

101
00:08:47,293 --> 00:08:49,284
- Good, yes.
- Oh, my goodness.

102
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:50,693
Is that what I won?

103
00:08:50,763 --> 00:08:53,789
- Yes, ma'am.
- They're just beautiful.

104
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:55,458
- Watch out.
- Excuse me, sir.

105
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,298
Dad, can you believe it?

106
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,930
No more boiling diapers
on top of the stove.

107
00:09:00,006 --> 00:09:03,567
Yep, gonna miss it.
It made a nice soup.

108
00:09:03,643 --> 00:09:05,042
The cost of modern living.

109
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:07,011
Sir, we're looking for Mrs. E. Ryan.

110
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:09,707
- There.
- Oh, hello. I'm up here.

111
00:09:09,782 --> 00:09:11,613
This is your new home freezer.

112
00:09:11,684 --> 00:09:13,242
Mikey, honey, get down.

113
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:15,184
"Ask any Eskimo and they'll say,

114
00:09:15,254 --> 00:09:17,848
frozen keeps
the freshness in every day."

115
00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:21,826
My gosh. I forgot all about that one.
When it rains, it pours.

116
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:23,225
Down.

117
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:24,558
Well, bring it on in.

118
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:26,927
How's it going, Pop?

119
00:09:26,999 --> 00:09:29,832
Don't make your old man
carry this couch.

120
00:09:31,103 --> 00:09:32,661
Come on.

121
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:39,407
OK, on the count of three.
One, two, three.

122
00:09:39,478 --> 00:09:42,208
Tuff, keep that cat out of the house.

123
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:48,846
What are you doing?

124
00:09:49,522 --> 00:09:50,784
Here.

125
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:53,754
A little bit of this?

126
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,454
Good?

127
00:10:00,466 --> 00:10:04,562
Dad, isn't this the biggest freezer
you ever seen in your life?

128
00:10:04,637 --> 00:10:06,537
It's like the ones in restaurants.

129
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:09,837
The deliveryman told me
it would hold two sides of beef.

130
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:11,774
Seems like overkill to me.

131
00:10:12,845 --> 00:10:16,576
Besides, it's dangerous.
A kid could fall in there and suffocate.

132
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:20,779
- No, we won't.
- I don't want to say I told you so.

133
00:10:20,853 --> 00:10:23,253
- I'd like to keep it.
- What the heck for?

134
00:10:23,322 --> 00:10:25,882
Do you know how much
electricity this will eat?

135
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:28,358
It inspires me.
It's something to be filled.

136
00:10:28,427 --> 00:10:29,621
Good luck with that.

137
00:10:29,695 --> 00:10:32,493
Even Howard Hughes
couldn't fill that thing.

138
00:10:32,565 --> 00:10:34,533
We got plenty in it already.

139
00:10:36,502 --> 00:10:39,699
- Only dishes, but something's in there.
- Yeah.

140
00:10:39,772 --> 00:10:42,240
That'll take up
some of the room, at least.

141
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:48,105
The Red Sox, three,
Cleveland, two.

142
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,648
- The Indians have one last out.
- God's sakes!

143
00:10:50,716 --> 00:10:53,514
Bunch of bums, is what you are.

144
00:10:53,586 --> 00:10:57,022
- Bunch of bums.
- The bases are loaded.

145
00:10:57,089 --> 00:11:00,252
Writing a winning entry not only
requires a modicum of wit,

146
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:03,887
it also requires careful product focus.

147
00:11:03,963 --> 00:11:07,956
Notice I have not one,
but two brand names I need to use.

148
00:11:08,034 --> 00:11:10,127
You want to know
where this is headed?

149
00:11:10,202 --> 00:11:12,693
Niagara Falls, straight down.

150
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:15,002
Here's what I have so far.

151
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:17,269
"Wide selections, priced to please her.

152
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:20,073
Scads of Seabrook's in their freezer.

153
00:11:20,146 --> 00:11:22,410
Warmth that scorns the impersonal trend,

154
00:11:22,481 --> 00:11:25,541
stamps Big Chief
as the housewife's friend."

155
00:11:26,652 --> 00:11:29,485
Mom, I left my
spelling book in the kitchen.

156
00:11:30,923 --> 00:11:32,515
All right, honey.

157
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:36,620
- Strike two.
- God damn it.

158
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,561
- Where is it?
- What's the matter?

159
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:40,223
Take the bat off your shoulder.

160
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:43,291
- Who's ahead?
- The Red Sox.

161
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:45,836
All right.

162
00:11:45,905 --> 00:11:48,567
Come on, you moron. Hit the ball!

163
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:52,737
...gets the sign... on third...

164
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:54,404
...here's the pitch...

165
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,573
Cold! Strike three.

166
00:11:56,649 --> 00:12:00,415
God damn it to holy fucking hell!

167
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:03,421
You're killing us, you stupid bastard!

168
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:05,389
Hey, shut up over there!

169
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:08,048
You shut up!

170
00:12:08,127 --> 00:12:10,755
This is a family neighborhood.
Clean your mouth.

171
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:14,197
I'll clean you up!
Who are you, the Pope?

172
00:12:14,266 --> 00:12:17,030
Oh, for crying out loud.
I can't believe we got...

173
00:12:18,003 --> 00:12:21,131
Goddamn piece of shit!

174
00:12:23,008 --> 00:12:24,908
Where you trying to go with that?

175
00:12:24,977 --> 00:12:27,741
This goddamn thing is too big
for this goddamn house!

176
00:12:27,813 --> 00:12:30,907
You're gonna hurt your back.
Why not wait until morning?

177
00:12:30,983 --> 00:12:34,384
I want this goddamn thing
out of the house right now!

178
00:12:34,453 --> 00:12:37,422
I want it out!

179
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:41,051
- I never wanted it!
- All right, I'll see what I can do.

180
00:12:56,342 --> 00:12:58,833
You'll enjoy...

181
00:12:59,345 --> 00:13:02,508
The clean, tangy taste of Dr. Pepper.

182
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:06,181
- Nice try.
- Sorry, Mrs. Bidlack.

183
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:08,480
Watch it.

184
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:13,316
Maybe we should talk on the radio.

185
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:26,135
Indians.
I can't believe the Indians...

186
00:13:26,205 --> 00:13:28,298
Problem is they got no clean-up batter.

187
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:31,036
- Clean up what?
- Half the team's in a slump.

188
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:33,601
Best move to make
is get rid of that manager.

189
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:36,375
You can't blame him.
Pitching, I'm telling you...

190
00:13:36,448 --> 00:13:39,679
- What a world.
- Yeah. There's always...

191
00:13:39,752 --> 00:13:42,619
- We're gonna take off now.
- Take it easy.

192
00:13:42,688 --> 00:13:45,418
Hey, thanks, Tim.

193
00:13:48,594 --> 00:13:50,653
He won't give you anymore trouble.

194
00:13:50,729 --> 00:13:53,027
Best thing to do
is let him sleep it off.

195
00:13:57,036 --> 00:13:59,231
Hey, Dick, how's the pitching arm?

196
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:01,296
Going for a no-hitter next season?

197
00:14:01,373 --> 00:14:03,432
- You bet.
- Go get 'em, kiddo.

198
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:13,842
Here you go. I made this for you.

199
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:15,944
Thank you, Dad.

200
00:14:18,657 --> 00:14:19,988
I'm tired.

201
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:22,220
Your pajamas are on the bed.

202
00:14:22,294 --> 00:14:23,522
Thank you.

203
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:33,828
Mom?

204
00:14:33,906 --> 00:14:36,033
Father McCague's here.

205
00:14:39,645 --> 00:14:41,977
I don't think that you need to worry.

206
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:45,141
I'm sure that he's learned his lesson.

207
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:48,084
This has been going on
for a very long time.

208
00:14:48,153 --> 00:14:52,214
Every night he drinks
a six pack and a pint of whiskey.

209
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:54,953
By the end of the week
nothing's left of his check.

210
00:14:55,027 --> 00:14:56,824
It's all gone to the liquor store.

211
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,989
Kelly has a big family to take care of.

212
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:03,296
I'm sure he's carrying around
the weight of the world.

213
00:15:05,104 --> 00:15:08,631
But the more he drinks,
the less he's able to pay the bills,

214
00:15:08,707 --> 00:15:10,868
which is one reason he's so unhappy.

215
00:15:10,943 --> 00:15:12,934
But it's up to you, you see,

216
00:15:13,012 --> 00:15:16,812
- to make him a good home.
- But I do.

217
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:20,418
Well, you'll have
to try a little harder.

218
00:15:23,055 --> 00:15:27,549
No one says that life is easy.

219
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:35,758
Thank you for coming by, Father.

220
00:15:38,203 --> 00:15:40,933
Yes, indeed.

221
00:15:51,016 --> 00:15:54,884
Are you being obedient
and saying all your prayers?

222
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,615
Yes, Father.

223
00:15:57,189 --> 00:16:00,955
Good boy. I'll see you in church.

224
00:16:05,564 --> 00:16:08,829
His breath smells like Dad's.

225
00:16:08,901 --> 00:16:12,837
Well, maybe that's why Father
likes to use so much incense.

226
00:16:15,374 --> 00:16:17,774
All right, kids.

227
00:16:17,843 --> 00:16:21,006
Let's go to bed.
I'm tired of this day.

228
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,147
I need a new one.

229
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:22,806
I need a new one.

230
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:25,042
If I may pause
in the story for a moment,

231
00:16:25,117 --> 00:16:27,745
I'd like to briefly explain my marriage.

232
00:16:28,854 --> 00:16:33,052
As a young scribe, I was a resident wit
for the Sherwood Weekly Chronicle.

233
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:35,650
Queen Elizabeth
invented ladies' stockings.

234
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:39,027
Since her time,
they've covered a multitude of shins.

235
00:16:39,098 --> 00:16:41,362
Evelyn, that's top-notch.

236
00:16:41,433 --> 00:16:43,867
I had potential, as they say.

237
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:48,229
I was also in sore need of adventure.

238
00:16:48,307 --> 00:16:51,401
And Kelly Ryan was loads of fun.

239
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:08,059
He loved music
as much as I loved words.

240
00:17:08,127 --> 00:17:11,619
And we were just the perfect match.

241
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:28,744
Then one night, Kelly's career
as a crooner came to a terrible end.

242
00:17:33,752 --> 00:17:36,915
And so, our life in Defiance began...

243
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:42,252
...where my husband joined
the ranks of ordinary men.

244
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:51,799
So if he seems unhelpful at times

245
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:53,804
or selfish or mean,

246
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,803
please remember
that he lost his voice,

247
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,241
while I kept mine.

248
00:18:03,649 --> 00:18:05,048
Here you go, Dick.

249
00:18:05,117 --> 00:18:07,551
There's a soldier on this glass,
look at that.

250
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:09,382
Who's winning the battle?

251
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:15,683
Drink your milk, baby.

252
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:18,229
Morning, Mother. Morning, kids.

253
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:19,958
Morning, Dad.

254
00:18:20,032 --> 00:18:24,059
What do you say I fix
everyone some pancakes?

255
00:18:24,136 --> 00:18:27,731
You can't. We're out of milk.
I need some money, by the way.

256
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:31,538
How about coffee?
You guys are old enough.

257
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,840
- No, thanks.
- No.

258
00:18:37,516 --> 00:18:40,041
Who the heck did this?
One of you kids?

259
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,882
You did, Daddy.

260
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:45,651
No, siree. I think it was...

261
00:18:45,724 --> 00:18:46,816
...you.

262
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:49,787
No, I did not.

263
00:18:51,363 --> 00:18:52,455
Yeah.

264
00:18:52,531 --> 00:18:56,490
Well, you can't sell it now.
Looks like we're stuck with it.

265
00:18:56,568 --> 00:18:58,763
It seems like we are.

266
00:18:58,837 --> 00:19:00,498
How about I take up hunting,

267
00:19:00,572 --> 00:19:02,665
fill that thing full of duck and deer?

268
00:19:02,741 --> 00:19:04,436
No, Daddy!

269
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:06,808
You don't like that idea, OK.

270
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:08,904
Well, how about I just go shoot

271
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:11,848
some squirrels
and little bunny rabbits?

272
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:14,886
How about you don't spend
so much at the liquor store.

273
00:19:24,796 --> 00:19:26,320
Tell you what.

274
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:29,996
Every night, when I come home,

275
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:33,329
I'll bring something
from the grocery store.

276
00:19:33,405 --> 00:19:37,637
I'm gonna fill that to the very top,
even if it takes me a year.

277
00:19:38,744 --> 00:19:42,544
- What do you think of that?
- I think that's a wonderful idea.

278
00:19:45,117 --> 00:19:47,608
I gotta go to work
so I can bring home the bacon.

279
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:51,281
- And a porterhouse steak.
- Hey, I'm not kidding.

280
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:53,347
You just watch your old man.

281
00:19:53,425 --> 00:19:55,518
I need money for the milkman.

282
00:20:05,404 --> 00:20:07,065
That's not enough.

283
00:20:07,673 --> 00:20:09,334
That's all I have.

284
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:12,741
OK.

285
00:20:13,612 --> 00:20:15,102
Bye, kids.

286
00:20:17,115 --> 00:20:18,776
Bye.

287
00:20:20,786 --> 00:20:23,812
How's Dad gonna fill the freezer
when he can't pay for milk?

288
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:26,255
I have no idea, honey.

289
00:20:26,825 --> 00:20:29,020
But at least he has a goal.

290
00:20:29,494 --> 00:20:29,561
Now the moment is here

291
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:31,426
Now the moment is here

292
00:20:31,496 --> 00:20:33,964
when Queen for A Day
makes your wish come true.

293
00:20:34,032 --> 00:20:36,364
We're going to
the Everson-Jennings company

294
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:39,404
and order one of their sturdy,
folding wheelchairs.

295
00:20:39,471 --> 00:20:40,904
There's a sample.

296
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:43,066
- Mommy.
- Yes, honey?

297
00:20:44,776 --> 00:20:48,405
Davey messed his diaper
and I tried to change him.

298
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,914
Oh, show me.

299
00:20:54,219 --> 00:20:56,278
Oh, Barbie.

300
00:20:56,355 --> 00:21:00,257
The trick is to hold the baby's legs up
while you take the diaper off.

301
00:21:00,325 --> 00:21:03,761
- I got it on my hands.
- I know you did, sweetheart.

302
00:21:03,829 --> 00:21:06,354
OK, now, here we go. Follow me.

303
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:09,594
All right, don't touch anything.
Come on, Betsy, you too.

304
00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:13,104
Let's wash your hands.
Yeah. Come on, come on.

305
00:21:13,171 --> 00:21:14,934
All right, everybody. Come on.

306
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:20,005
OK, put your hands under the faucet.

307
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:28,914
- Milk delivery!
- Just a minute, I'll be right there.

308
00:21:30,188 --> 00:21:32,418
Come on. I've got deliveries to make.

309
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,524
Just a minute, please.

310
00:21:38,196 --> 00:21:41,063
- I'm leaving.
- No, you aren't.

311
00:21:43,068 --> 00:21:45,036
I'm on my way.

312
00:21:47,673 --> 00:21:51,302
OK, girls. Stay in the kitchen
till I can clean this up.

313
00:21:55,614 --> 00:21:57,946
You know that I got a schedule to keep.

314
00:21:58,016 --> 00:22:00,644
I know you do, Ray.
What a life you lead.

315
00:22:00,719 --> 00:22:03,210
- Three dollars.
- I'm a little short this week.

316
00:22:03,288 --> 00:22:04,414
Can I owe you?

317
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:07,151
I got three other families
on credit this week.

318
00:22:07,225 --> 00:22:10,126
- You know I'm always good for it.
- I'm not a bank.

319
00:22:10,195 --> 00:22:12,459
You could start charging interest.

320
00:22:12,531 --> 00:22:14,294
Don't get smart with me.

321
00:22:14,366 --> 00:22:16,800
- Smart people know their budget.
- Right.

322
00:22:16,868 --> 00:22:19,359
That's why I don't have
a problem paying bills.

323
00:22:19,438 --> 00:22:21,429
Hello, Vernon.
Anything for me today?

324
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:24,669
You want something in life,
you got to pay for it.

325
00:22:24,743 --> 00:22:26,540
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

326
00:22:26,611 --> 00:22:27,805
Hey, Ray.

327
00:22:27,879 --> 00:22:29,506
Oh, hold on.

328
00:22:31,283 --> 00:22:33,410
How do you like that?

329
00:22:33,485 --> 00:22:36,716
I won two dollars in the poetry
contest for The Toledo Blade.

330
00:22:36,788 --> 00:22:37,812
There you go.

331
00:22:45,063 --> 00:22:46,826
There he goes.

332
00:22:48,633 --> 00:22:51,363
Yeah. You want the money?

333
00:22:51,903 --> 00:22:54,872
I'm sorry I made such a mess, Mommy.

334
00:22:56,108 --> 00:22:58,508
Well, actually, honey,

335
00:22:58,577 --> 00:23:01,375
if I had gotten
the door any sooner,

336
00:23:01,446 --> 00:23:04,973
then the milkman would have
left before the mailman arrived,

337
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:08,247
and we wouldn't have had
any milk for our dinner tonight.

338
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,345
So, there you go.

339
00:23:10,422 --> 00:23:12,219
It was all meant to be.

340
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:23,024
This is what happens to one's literary
efforts once placed in the mailbox.

341
00:23:26,104 --> 00:23:30,302
For the big contests, they go sailing
off to New York City to be judged.

342
00:23:30,375 --> 00:23:34,243
The average count
is a million and a half entries.

343
00:23:34,312 --> 00:23:37,645
A million and a half. Imagine that!

344
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:44,211
Each entry is first checked to make sure
it's accompanied by proof of purchase.

345
00:23:44,289 --> 00:23:47,087
You don't pay, you don't play.

346
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:48,956
Next they go to the juniorjudges.

347
00:23:49,027 --> 00:23:50,824
College English majors, mind you,

348
00:23:50,896 --> 00:23:53,364
who are instructed
to eliminate the trite,

349
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:56,924
the obvious and the inept. Oh, dear.

350
00:23:57,002 --> 00:24:00,267
And so, the final judging begins.

351
00:24:00,338 --> 00:24:03,466
Every syllable of every word
is scrutinized and analyzed,

352
00:24:03,542 --> 00:24:06,943
the merits of each debated
until a few of the worthiest remain.

353
00:24:07,012 --> 00:24:10,743
The ballots are cast,
the points are added up

354
00:24:10,816 --> 00:24:13,979
and the grand prize winner is declared.

355
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:25,395
Oh, my gosh!

356
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:29,457
- Mommy won a shopping spree!
- Oh, yeah?

357
00:24:29,534 --> 00:24:31,434
They time her as she runs in the store.

358
00:24:31,503 --> 00:24:35,303
She can get whatever she wants.
She's gonna get us a bunch of candy...

359
00:24:35,373 --> 00:24:38,831
And fancy nuts.
I'm gonna eat a cashew.

360
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:41,373
Can you believe it?

361
00:24:41,446 --> 00:24:43,141
That's terrific, Mother.

362
00:24:43,215 --> 00:24:45,547
Now, I only get
ten minutes and one cart,

363
00:24:45,617 --> 00:24:48,814
so what I did was, I walked
to the market to plot my strategy.

364
00:24:48,887 --> 00:24:52,345
- Wait till you hear this.
- The carts are smaller than at the A&P.

365
00:24:52,424 --> 00:24:55,757
- Mom talked to the butcher.
- He's gonna wrap up bacon and ribs.

366
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:59,991
- I can build up the cart that way.
- Sounds pretty clever.

367
00:25:00,065 --> 00:25:03,762
I asked him to set aside a prime rib,
a chateaubriand, what do you think?

368
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:06,531
- We each get our own filet mignon.
- Absolutely.

369
00:25:06,605 --> 00:25:08,596
Tuff, honey, would you set the table?

370
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:11,642
I had filet mignon once.
It ain't that great.

371
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:13,769
When have you started saying "ain't"?

372
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:16,678
Get off your high horse.
It's a perfectly good word.

373
00:25:18,216 --> 00:25:21,151
- Here.
- Oh, thank you.

374
00:25:21,753 --> 00:25:24,244
This is perfect.
I was gonna put on fish sticks,

375
00:25:24,322 --> 00:25:26,290
but now I can make sloppy joes.

376
00:25:27,225 --> 00:25:28,920
Might as well cook it up now.

377
00:25:28,994 --> 00:25:32,896
Looks like hamburger's not gonna be
good enough for this family anymore.

378
00:25:32,964 --> 00:25:35,899
Oh, of course it is.
Itjust won't be the only thing we know.

379
00:25:35,967 --> 00:25:38,902
I asked the kids to make a list
of what they want me to grab.

380
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:42,906
- What would you like?
- Don't waste any space on me.

381
00:25:42,974 --> 00:25:46,740
Oh, now stop. Think.
What have you always wanted to try?

382
00:25:46,811 --> 00:25:48,745
- I don't know.
- Sure you do.

383
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:54,448
Shrimp cocktail.

384
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:57,920
The kind they have in those little jars.

385
00:25:57,989 --> 00:26:01,755
I like the way they look,
kind of elegant.

386
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:04,553
I always wanted one of those.

387
00:26:04,629 --> 00:26:06,654
You shall have it.

388
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:11,862
Thank you, Mother.

389
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:18,675
Proud of the old lady.

390
00:26:34,893 --> 00:26:37,293
- But I think you should...
- Oh, no.

391
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:44,428
Are all these kids yours?

392
00:26:45,737 --> 00:26:48,604
- Hi, Mom.
- Yes. If it's all right,

393
00:26:48,673 --> 00:26:52,040
they were going to call out the time
so I could stay on schedule.

394
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:54,670
Oh, I don't know.

395
00:26:56,081 --> 00:26:58,072
I don't see any problem with that.

396
00:26:59,818 --> 00:27:03,345
And any help you happen
to give Mrs. Ryan in filling her cart

397
00:27:03,421 --> 00:27:05,082
won't be seen by me.

398
00:27:07,192 --> 00:27:09,353
So, then, are you ready?

399
00:27:09,427 --> 00:27:10,758
Hold on.

400
00:27:26,244 --> 00:27:29,839
- Didn't like the way that sounded.
- Thank you.

401
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,481
All set?

402
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:37,019
Go!

403
00:27:41,192 --> 00:27:43,990
Go! Faster!

404
00:27:44,062 --> 00:27:45,757
- I think we should split up.
- OK.

405
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:49,197
I'll take the frozen section,
you take the European food aisle.

406
00:27:49,267 --> 00:27:52,259
- What do you want, hon?
- Oh, caviar, expensive things.

407
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:54,362
The good stuff, not the ordinary.

408
00:27:54,439 --> 00:27:55,963
Gotcha.

409
00:27:56,041 --> 00:27:57,565
Marge, go!

410
00:28:04,983 --> 00:28:07,952
Seven minutes to go!

411
00:28:24,135 --> 00:28:26,535
Three minutes. Come on!

412
00:28:40,118 --> 00:28:42,177
One minute left!

413
00:28:44,355 --> 00:28:47,119
I got you some goose pate.
You ever had that?

414
00:28:47,192 --> 00:28:49,422
- No.
- Let me know what it's like.

415
00:28:49,494 --> 00:28:52,395
I got all the after-dinner mints,
the Swiss chocolate,

416
00:28:52,464 --> 00:28:55,592
two bags of English toffees
and a couple bags of coffee mints.

417
00:28:55,667 --> 00:28:58,192
Grab and move on. Where to?

418
00:28:58,269 --> 00:28:59,964
- Produce!
- What for?

419
00:29:00,038 --> 00:29:02,404
Exotic, anything grown
in a foreign country.

420
00:29:02,474 --> 00:29:04,874
- Does Hawaii count?
- Yes.

421
00:29:04,943 --> 00:29:07,173
Thirty seconds!
