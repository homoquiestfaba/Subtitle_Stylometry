1
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:39,689
It's starting!
Rainbow Randolph!

2
00:00:40,056 --> 00:00:42,752
Welcome to The Rainbow Randolph Show!

3
00:00:42,926 --> 00:00:46,259
Kidnet presents America's
favorite kid-show host...

4
00:00:46,429 --> 00:00:50,422
...the friendliest friend
on earth, Rainbow Randolph!

5
00:00:50,633 --> 00:00:53,500
Featuring Angelo Pike
and the Krinkle Kids!

6
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:55,831
Friends come in all sizes

7
00:00:56,106 --> 00:00:58,131
That's right, Rainbow.

8
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:10,613
Friends come in all sizes
That's a fact, it's true

9
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:13,983
All the colors of rainbow
From mauve to blue

10
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:16,215
Their names are different
Their shoes don't match

11
00:01:16,392 --> 00:01:17,950
Some like to toss
While others to catch

12
00:01:18,261 --> 00:01:21,753
One might say "grasp"
While the other says "snatch"

13
00:01:21,965 --> 00:01:24,627
Because

14
00:01:33,076 --> 00:01:36,170
Friends come in all sizes
Take it from me

15
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:40,307
Golly gee, size never matters
When you want some friendly patter

16
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:43,175
From a pal who is true

17
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:46,822
And can lift you up when you're blue

18
00:01:47,657 --> 00:01:51,753
You can count on him
He can count on you

19
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,395
It's true

20
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:03,328
Friends come in all sizes
Friends come in all sizes

21
00:02:03,673 --> 00:02:05,004
Yes, they do

22
00:02:05,642 --> 00:02:09,476
You know what else
comes in all sizes? Our products.

23
00:02:09,646 --> 00:02:13,514
They're there online for you
at RainbowRandolph.com.

24
00:02:13,683 --> 00:02:16,345
Log on, it's not free.

25
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:47,077
You'll let my boy dance up front?
Gets to sit in the chair?

26
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:50,478
You want your booger-eater on my show?

27
00:02:50,687 --> 00:02:53,053
-Of course.
-Yes, very much.

28
00:02:53,456 --> 00:02:57,187
Then don't tell me how to
run my fucking business.

29
00:02:57,393 --> 00:03:01,124
-We were just--
-I'll call you if a spot opens up.

30
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:04,593
-Freeze!
-Drop the briefcase!

31
00:03:04,801 --> 00:03:06,598
I never touched the money.

32
00:03:06,803 --> 00:03:08,703
FBI! You're under arrest.

33
00:03:09,172 --> 00:03:11,936
I'm Rainbow-fucking-Randolph!
Kids love me!

34
00:03:12,141 --> 00:03:15,599
You have the right to remain silent.
If you give up....

35
00:03:15,812 --> 00:03:17,609
Corruption in Krinkleland?

36
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:22,843
Rainbow Randolph busted by feds
in midtown Patsy's Bar.

37
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:46,966
May I express that I am as shocked
and outraged by this as you.

38
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:51,341
Save it, Stokes! We got nervous
sponsors and an angry public.

39
00:03:51,547 --> 00:03:55,608
-What are you gonna do?
-I've compiled a list of replacements--

40
00:03:55,852 --> 00:03:58,946
Clean replacements?
With background checks?

41
00:03:59,188 --> 00:04:01,986
Christ!
Where do you dig up these people?

42
00:04:02,225 --> 00:04:06,161
I can assure you
that this network cannot survive...

43
00:04:06,396 --> 00:04:08,261
...another Rainbow Randolph.

44
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:12,400
Absolutely. It is my mission
to find a replacement.

45
00:04:12,602 --> 00:04:16,538
A performer of character and honor.
Most importantly--

46
00:04:16,706 --> 00:04:19,800
Squeaky-fucking-clean!

47
00:04:21,311 --> 00:04:22,938
Squeaky clean, sir.

48
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:25,272
-Buggy Ding Dong?
-Heroin mule.

49
00:04:25,481 --> 00:04:27,608
-Square Dance Danny?
-Wife beater.

50
00:04:27,817 --> 00:04:31,014
-Princess Poppy?
-Don't bust my balls.

51
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:35,647
-Skippy Black and the Trolls?
-Deported. And the Trolls....

52
00:04:35,892 --> 00:04:40,955
Who gives a shit? This is impossible.
I want to strangle Rainbow Randolph.

53
00:04:41,164 --> 00:04:44,156
Squeeze his neck
until his eyes pop out!

54
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:47,530
Before fantasizing, let's save my ass.

55
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:48,894
Sorry, Frank.

56
00:04:49,138 --> 00:04:50,628
Sheldon Mopes?

57
00:04:50,974 --> 00:04:55,035
Have we sunk to that level already?
Smoochy? What a sap!

58
00:04:55,278 --> 00:04:58,179
Sap's just the pill we need.
Get your feet off.

59
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:01,646
He's a guy in a suit.
A foamy. Fabric stuffer.

60
00:05:01,851 --> 00:05:06,879
They all are. Marginal talents,
off-Broadway runoff--

61
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:11,159
Last I heard, he's playing
hospitals and nursing homes.

62
00:05:11,361 --> 00:05:13,659
-He's bottom rung.
-This is the guy!

63
00:05:13,863 --> 00:05:18,357
We can do better than Mopes.
He brings nothing to the table.

64
00:05:18,601 --> 00:05:23,402
Except ethics. Never a whiff of
controversy. He's a harmless cornball.

65
00:05:23,606 --> 00:05:26,871
-Don't make me.
-A bottle of syrup with legs!

66
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:29,340
-Frank!
-Get me Smoochy!

67
00:05:36,686 --> 00:05:39,246
-Hello.
-Hi. This is Nora Wells--

68
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:44,291
Just kidding. It's a machine.
Leave a message or catch an appearance.

69
00:05:44,527 --> 00:05:47,655
I'm opening the children's wing
at the library.

70
00:05:47,864 --> 00:05:50,424
Or catch me at the
methadone clinic.

71
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:53,792
Remember,
you can't change the world...

72
00:05:54,003 --> 00:05:56,767
-...but you can make a dent.
-You bet.

73
00:06:12,055 --> 00:06:14,580
Thanks a lot, fellas. Ladies, yeah.

74
00:06:14,757 --> 00:06:18,716
Looking at the faces, I think it's
time to wrap things up.

75
00:06:18,928 --> 00:06:22,489
I'll close with a ditty.
You may recognize the tune.

76
00:06:22,732 --> 00:06:27,999
I took some liberties with the lyrics.
If you figure out the chorus, join in.

77
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:36,039
We'll get you off that smack
Yes, we will

78
00:06:36,212 --> 00:06:39,272
We'll get you off that smack
Yes, we will

79
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:44,776
We'll get you off that smack
We'll kick that monkey off your back

80
00:06:45,021 --> 00:06:47,819
And get your life on track
Yes, we will

81
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,428
It's important to get
started now, though. You know why?

82
00:06:56,666 --> 00:07:01,000
Cause the smack can lead to crack
Yes, it can

83
00:07:01,204 --> 00:07:04,196
Carl, you know what
I'm talking about.

84
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,135
Sing it with me now.

85
00:07:06,809 --> 00:07:09,937
Giving up that smack
Yes, we are

86
00:07:12,315 --> 00:07:13,680
Take it easy.

87
00:07:13,883 --> 00:07:15,817
Mr. Mopes?

88
00:07:16,452 --> 00:07:19,853
I saw your performance.
It was very spirited.

89
00:07:20,056 --> 00:07:22,024
Thank you very much.

90
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:25,126
Sometimes I do a longer set, but...

91
00:07:25,294 --> 00:07:29,788
...once the evening meds kick in,
it's pretty much sleepytime.

92
00:07:29,999 --> 00:07:31,796
Tough to get a sing-along.

93
00:07:31,968 --> 00:07:36,701
At least you know the smack's
knocking them out and not your singing.

94
00:07:36,906 --> 00:07:38,305
God, I hope so.

95
00:07:38,741 --> 00:07:40,675
Can we talk for a minute?

96
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:46,576
I'm happy to do this, but we have
trained counselors who can help you.

97
00:07:46,782 --> 00:07:48,841
You came on the H train?

98
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:52,544
-Riding the horse? On the juice?
-No.

99
00:07:52,755 --> 00:07:54,985
It's sweet of you to assume so.

100
00:07:55,191 --> 00:07:59,787
I'm Nora Wells. I'm V.P.
of development for Kidnet.

101
00:07:59,996 --> 00:08:01,964
-You work for Kidnet?!
-Yeah.

102
00:08:02,365 --> 00:08:04,959
-Are you serious?
-Yeah...

103
00:08:05,168 --> 00:08:07,568
...as a heart attack.

104
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:12,434
I'm glad I didn't know you were here.
That might have thrown me off.

105
00:08:12,775 --> 00:08:17,337
I was born November 11, 1970.
You know what else happened that day?

106
00:08:17,547 --> 00:08:19,344
The first Sesame Street.

107
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:23,780
You wouldn't believe what it took
to get soy dogs here.

108
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:28,116
Hello? People, wake up
and smell the future.

109
00:08:28,324 --> 00:08:33,557
Organic, twice the protein
and nobody gets killed.

110
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:37,524
I'm gonna get you on these
gluten-free buns.

111
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:40,827
-We will change the world!
-All right, Sheldon.

112
00:08:41,037 --> 00:08:44,438
Like I was saying,
my friends are always saying:

113
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:49,544
"As talented as you are, if you don't
learn to sell yourself a little...

114
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:54,807
...you'll always be playing to a very
appreciative, but limited audience."

115
00:08:55,017 --> 00:08:57,076
Spirulina with almond butter?

116
00:08:57,286 --> 00:09:00,221
-Sure you don't wanna try?
-No.

117
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:03,254
This is children's entertainment.

118
00:09:03,426 --> 00:09:06,122
It's about doing good work.

119
00:09:06,529 --> 00:09:07,757
Having integrity.

120
00:09:08,264 --> 00:09:12,200
A good show, with the foundation
of a positive message.

121
00:09:12,401 --> 00:09:17,134
You can't build a foundation with
plaster of Paris. You use concrete.

122
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:20,605
That is concrete, sister.
That is integrity!

123
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:22,304
I can see that.

124
00:09:26,716 --> 00:09:28,581
-Sorry.
-Listen, Mr. Mopes.

125
00:09:29,752 --> 00:09:31,276
The reason I'm here....

126
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:35,217
Kidnet is currently looking
for a performer...

127
00:09:35,391 --> 00:09:38,258
...with convictions and integrity.

128
00:09:38,427 --> 00:09:40,554
Somebody like yourself.

129
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:42,424
Hold the phone.

130
00:09:42,598 --> 00:09:47,934
Kidnet is finally ready to pursue
a show of Smoochy caliber?

131
00:09:48,137 --> 00:09:50,697
I mean, to commit to Smoochy quality?

132
00:09:50,973 --> 00:09:55,034
Yes, I believe we're ready
to push ourselves to that level.

133
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:03,816
I knew it!

134
00:10:05,154 --> 00:10:08,612
I knew it. I knew
if I waited long enough...

135
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:11,817
...I knew somebody
would come along one day...

136
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:15,464
...who took a look at me
and understood what I do.

137
00:10:15,665 --> 00:10:17,360
That's you. You get me.

138
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,893
I'm afraid so.

139
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:24,199
Well, Nora Wells,
Miss V.P. of Development...

140
00:10:24,407 --> 00:10:27,171
...let's you and me go make history!

141
00:11:11,153 --> 00:11:12,586
I like it.

142
00:11:25,534 --> 00:11:28,833
Get your $50 bump for working
in smoke this week.

143
00:11:29,038 --> 00:11:30,198
Hey, Angelo.

144
00:11:30,373 --> 00:11:33,865
I was a big fan of your work
with the Krinkle Kids.

145
00:11:34,076 --> 00:11:37,204
I appreciate you coming over
to be a Rhinette.

146
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:38,711
A job's a job.

147
00:11:39,181 --> 00:11:40,739
See you out there.

148
00:11:51,527 --> 00:11:53,392
Where can you go when skies turn gray

149
00:11:53,596 --> 00:11:55,723
Where the sun always shines
And the animals play

150
00:11:55,931 --> 00:11:59,594
Where every day is a happy day
Well, Smoochy's here to show the way

151
00:12:05,107 --> 00:12:07,268
Smoochy's Magic Jungle

152
00:12:07,443 --> 00:12:11,311
It's a happy, it's a happy
Happy, happy place

153
00:12:18,888 --> 00:12:21,413
Hip, hip, hip, hooray!

154
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:36,263
I thought you weren't coming.
You'd forgotten.

155
00:12:36,472 --> 00:12:39,669
Agreed to meet you.
I had a dinner engagement.

156
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:44,539
Really? I used to have dinner
engagements. Four or five a night.

157
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:46,447
Don't do this, Randy.

158
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:54,412
I'd go to a restaurant,
10 guys reached for my hat.

159
00:12:54,623 --> 00:12:59,083
I'd go to take a piss, they'd
clear the restroom. You know why?

160
00:12:59,728 --> 00:13:03,027
I'm Rainbow-fucking-Randolph,
that's why!

161
00:13:03,466 --> 00:13:04,626
You through?

162
00:13:06,001 --> 00:13:10,165
What? You got things to do?
You don't have time for me?

163
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:15,173
The guy who earned for you? Put the
Armani surplus suits on your back?

164
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:18,005
The coq au vin in your Brooklyn mouth.

165
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:21,843
We helped each other.
Till someone messed up....

166
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:26,044
Who could that be?
Right, it was Rainbow-fucking-Randolph!

167
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:28,520
For what? Ass-wipe money.

168
00:13:29,692 --> 00:13:33,128
You gotta fix this.
I want my old time slot back.

169
00:13:33,329 --> 00:13:38,164
I can't sit and watch that one-horn
carpetbagger get my time slot.

170
00:13:38,434 --> 00:13:41,096
He gets a free ride on my dime.

171
00:13:41,303 --> 00:13:43,100
Come on. We got a history.

172
00:13:43,339 --> 00:13:46,797
There's nothing I can do for you.
You're a pariah.

173
00:13:47,142 --> 00:13:50,600
-I can't even be seen with you.
-Don't do this to me.

174
00:13:50,813 --> 00:13:53,281
I'm going down for the last time.

175
00:13:53,482 --> 00:13:56,781
They kicked me out of the penthouse.
I'm homeless.

176
00:13:56,986 --> 00:13:59,250
Put yourself in my Capezios.

177
00:13:59,455 --> 00:14:02,618
The truth is, your shoes
have become my shoes.

178
00:14:02,825 --> 00:14:07,455
As long as he's on, everything's
by the book. No percentage, no skim.

179
00:14:07,663 --> 00:14:10,894
Network wanted squeaky clean
and they got it.

180
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,660
Mopes is sparkling.

181
00:14:15,538 --> 00:14:17,472
Please?

182
00:14:18,307 --> 00:14:19,899
You got nothing left?

183
00:14:20,976 --> 00:14:24,639
Exactly. That's what I've been
trying to tell you.

184
00:14:32,154 --> 00:14:33,621
What's this?

185
00:14:33,856 --> 00:14:37,519
A Rain Forest Benefit freebie bag.
Disposable camera...

186
00:14:37,726 --> 00:14:39,387
...Kahlúa flavored peanuts...

187
00:14:40,229 --> 00:14:43,164
...hand lotions, no animal-tested....

188
00:14:43,999 --> 00:14:46,900
Don't ever contact me again, Randy.

189
00:14:48,904 --> 00:14:50,269
Get out of the car.

190
00:14:53,242 --> 00:14:56,302
You know what to do
with the lotion, jerk-off.

191
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:00,782
You'll get yours!

192
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,742
The rhino too!

193
00:15:03,252 --> 00:15:05,743
Wheels are turning!

194
00:15:09,858 --> 00:15:13,954
Even a guy who's squeaky clean
falls into the mud.

195
00:15:17,533 --> 00:15:21,094
Smoochy and Rhinette dolls
would be sold separately.

196
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:23,998
These are prototypes.
I've been assured...

197
00:15:24,239 --> 00:15:27,208
...that all the bugs
will be worked out.

198
00:15:27,443 --> 00:15:28,535
Let's recap.

199
00:15:28,744 --> 00:15:32,077
Yes to the Smoochy ice cream,
the string cheese...

200
00:15:32,281 --> 00:15:36,809
...the cola. We're in a dick-measuring
contest over the shampoo.

201
00:15:37,052 --> 00:15:40,510
Time out, people.
Let's hold the phone a second.

202
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:45,556
If I might interject.
We need to re-examine our principles.

203
00:15:46,895 --> 00:15:51,923
We are still trying-- Smoochy is
still trying to earn these kids' trust.

204
00:15:52,134 --> 00:15:56,503
We won't do that by selling
string cheese and shampoo and cola...

205
00:15:56,672 --> 00:16:00,369
...which contains no less than
two addictive substances.

206
00:16:01,076 --> 00:16:05,206
We need to focus on putting together
the best show possible.

207
00:16:05,414 --> 00:16:09,407
Deliver a positive message,
without bells and whistles.

208
00:16:09,618 --> 00:16:13,987
Can I get an amen, somebody?
Are you with me on this, team?

209
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,627
Damn.

210
00:16:21,497 --> 00:16:23,089
I got that.

211
00:16:23,465 --> 00:16:25,797
Shut the door, please.

212
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:30,495
Now lock it.
Thanks.

213
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:34,835
We're deciding if Smoochy-O's
are frosted or fruit-flavored.

214
00:16:35,044 --> 00:16:37,239
If anybody has a strong feeling....

215
00:16:37,479 --> 00:16:39,913
Our survey shows a dead heat.

216
00:16:40,149 --> 00:16:42,709
Frosted for old and fruity for young.

217
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:44,909
Have them both. Good.

218
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,283
-I like frosted. I like sweeter.
-Me too.

219
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:52,119
As a kid I ate frosted.
Let's go the old-fashioned way....

220
00:16:53,128 --> 00:16:55,562
I want to tell you honestly,
I felt....

221
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:57,857
Hey! Nora! Wait up.

222
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:04,065
I thought that was a good meeting
today. We tackled some hot issues.

223
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:07,572
I felt once or twice
my voice wasn't being heard.

224
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:09,903
That's a conservative estimate.

225
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:13,206
I want the show
to have weight. Substance.

226
00:17:13,415 --> 00:17:16,680
Silly songs, absolutely,
but with a message.

227
00:17:16,885 --> 00:17:21,015
Guess how many compositions
I have in the Smoochy songbook.

228
00:17:21,223 --> 00:17:23,987
-Do you sense my lack of interest?
-Over 300...

229
00:17:24,193 --> 00:17:28,653
...on subjects from vegetables to
the importance of donating plasma.

230
00:17:28,864 --> 00:17:31,424
I'm a valuable resource, Nora.
Use me--

231
00:17:31,667 --> 00:17:35,626
Okay, stop talking.
I'm gonna make this real easy for you.

232
00:17:35,838 --> 00:17:41,071
The only reason you're on TV is
because Rainbow Randolph is a scumbag.

233
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:45,478
I didn't discover you.
I delivered you, like groceries.

234
00:17:45,681 --> 00:17:48,912
I got more emotional investment
in my nail polish.

235
00:17:49,118 --> 00:17:51,279
So don't peddle your sap to me.

236
00:17:51,754 --> 00:17:54,689
Your job is to smile
and nod your head.

237
00:18:12,741 --> 00:18:17,474
Look. I'm not literally comparing
Captain Kangaroo to Jesus Christ.

238
00:18:17,913 --> 00:18:20,643
I'm saying that the Captain,
like Christ...

239
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:24,285
...was someone you could
really believe in.

240
00:18:25,287 --> 00:18:26,879
With those guys...

241
00:18:27,089 --> 00:18:31,958
...it wasn't about the bells and
whistles, it was all about the work.

242
00:18:32,294 --> 00:18:35,991
Especially Jesus.
I mean, forget about it.

243
00:18:36,632 --> 00:18:39,999
I never saw anybody get
buzzed on orange juice.

244
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:44,104
I'll tell you a secret: Pop
a little liquid alfalfa in it...

245
00:18:44,306 --> 00:18:45,864
...it's blastoff time.

246
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:49,139
Let me have a Five Crown.

247
00:18:52,181 --> 00:18:54,672
-Hey.
-Smoochy the Rhino.

248
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:56,042
That's me.

249
00:18:56,251 --> 00:18:57,775
I'm a big fan.

250
00:18:59,188 --> 00:19:03,318
That's the first time anybody
recognized me out of the suit.

251
00:19:03,692 --> 00:19:06,422
Burke Bennett.
Kid-show talent agent.

252
00:19:06,628 --> 00:19:09,188
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

253
00:19:09,464 --> 00:19:12,865
Network goons are like that.
Stokes tried to screw him...

254
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:17,027
...out of merchandising points.
Claimed he had a warehouse full...

255
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:20,538
...of Dicky Dolls that weren't moving.
We're friends for years.

256
00:19:20,742 --> 00:19:23,540
I say to him, "Show me the warehouse."

257
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:27,738
I walk out of there
with a check for 100 grand...

258
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:30,817
...Stokes is sitting
with his thumb up his ass.

259
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:37,583
That's a great story, but the thing is,
with me, I don't care about that stuff.

260
00:19:37,793 --> 00:19:42,093
I don't care about Smoochy dolls,
chocolate, floor wax.

261
00:19:42,297 --> 00:19:46,028
I care about getting
creative input on my own show.

262
00:19:46,235 --> 00:19:49,762
You know, this rhino
came from my womb. Okay?

263
00:19:49,972 --> 00:19:51,940
I birthed him. I nursed him.

264
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:55,371
Damn it, I ought to be
the one who raises him.

265
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:59,907
It's all about the dough.
Once you get money, you get power.

266
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:03,380
Once you get power, you can have
Smoochy walk out...

267
00:20:03,585 --> 00:20:06,110
...with a dildo strapped to his head.

268
00:20:07,189 --> 00:20:11,990
I haven't thought of that idea.
I do see where you're going with this.

269
00:20:12,194 --> 00:20:15,095
When you wanna talk,
I'll cut the strings.

270
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:18,194
I'll open the magic door for you.

271
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:26,130
Well, how do you like that?

272
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:31,101
I laid the groundwork.
He's a bank with a horn.

273
00:20:31,346 --> 00:20:34,509
You'll make more with him than
20 Randolphs.

274
00:20:34,716 --> 00:20:36,684
Important to the Parade of Hope.

275
00:20:36,885 --> 00:20:39,683
It's in the bag.
We might have to massage him.

276
00:20:39,955 --> 00:20:43,721
Don't make me
lose my smile, Burkey-Boy.

277
00:20:49,898 --> 00:20:55,097
A special batch of cookies
for a very special rhino.

278
00:20:55,637 --> 00:20:57,901
How thoughtful of me.

279
00:20:58,473 --> 00:21:00,236
They're beautiful.

280
00:21:00,442 --> 00:21:06,347
You're going to learn about shame, my
dear Smoochy, and I'm your professor.

281
00:21:13,889 --> 00:21:17,620
Can we talk? Why was the
"Please and Thank You Song" cut?

282
00:21:17,826 --> 00:21:20,294
It takes away from the "Cookie Song."

283
00:21:20,495 --> 00:21:24,124
The "Cookie Song"
is meaningless fluff without it.

284
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:26,801
That's the lesson. The moral anchor.

285
00:21:27,069 --> 00:21:30,300
It's cut. And I want the
cookie lyrics changed back.

286
00:21:30,505 --> 00:21:33,497
I won't encourage kids to eat
a lot of sugar.

287
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:35,734
I have to like myself.

288
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:40,504
This is not a sprout farm.
You're here to sell sugar and plastic.

289
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:43,885
Do you hear yourself?
I won't do it.

290
00:21:44,286 --> 00:21:47,084
Does that say "Nora's Magic Jungle"?
No.

291
00:21:47,289 --> 00:21:49,018
I'm not your puppet.

292
00:21:49,358 --> 00:21:54,557
Since when? Get your spongy pink ass
out there and dance for the cameras.

293
00:22:00,969 --> 00:22:02,698
This is a kid show.

294
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:06,032
Those are children
I'm singing to out there.

295
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:11,235
You don't even see children anymore.
You just see wallets with pigtails.

296
00:22:36,571 --> 00:22:38,801
Bonsoir, le Smoochy.

297
00:22:39,007 --> 00:22:42,238
Welcome to Fatty Arbuckle-land.

298
00:22:53,555 --> 00:22:58,720
Don't worry, little ones.
Rainbow Randolph will return.

299
00:23:11,706 --> 00:23:12,764
All right!

300
00:23:13,208 --> 00:23:18,168
I'll tell you something. That jiggy-ing
and ziggy-ing makes me hungry.

301
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:20,780
When I'm hungry, what time is it?

302
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:24,076
Magic Cookie Time!

303
00:23:24,686 --> 00:23:28,019
-What?
-Magic Cookie Time!

304
00:23:28,623 --> 00:23:32,320
That's right! Everybody in the middle!

305
00:23:32,527 --> 00:23:34,427
Get in the middle!

306
00:23:37,432 --> 00:23:40,526
Angelo, hit me!

307
00:24:20,442 --> 00:24:22,672
Give them a cookie.

308
00:24:24,212 --> 00:24:28,876
Lookie, lookie, lookie
Here comes the cookie

309
00:24:29,117 --> 00:24:31,017
Fresh and organic

310
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:33,710
-No need to panic
-He didn't change it.

311
00:24:34,055 --> 00:24:38,924
Straight from the soil
No tropical oil

312
00:24:39,261 --> 00:24:43,493
Sweetened with juice
For an energy boost

313
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,525
Whatever, fucking peasant.

314
00:24:49,137 --> 00:24:51,935
-Who wants the first cookie?
-Me!

315
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:54,836
Let's see what we got today!

316
00:24:55,143 --> 00:24:56,735
Give them a cookie.

317
00:25:17,132 --> 00:25:18,121
My!

318
00:25:21,002 --> 00:25:22,993
It's a....

319
00:25:24,072 --> 00:25:26,006
It's a....

320
00:25:30,645 --> 00:25:31,976
A rocket ship!

321
00:25:32,514 --> 00:25:36,883
It's a rocket ship to fly us
to Jungle Land! Here we go!

322
00:25:37,085 --> 00:25:38,109
Fuck!

323
00:25:38,486 --> 00:25:40,317
Follow me!

324
00:25:40,522 --> 00:25:44,390
We're flying over the trees
on our magic rocket.

325
00:25:44,593 --> 00:25:45,958
What a special day!

326
00:25:46,428 --> 00:25:49,090
-Special cookies.
-Are you blind?

327
00:25:49,764 --> 00:25:53,291
-It's a cock! It's not a rocket!
-What is this?

328
00:25:53,501 --> 00:25:56,993
-Randolph! Get him out!
-Look. It's a cock and balls!

329
00:25:57,205 --> 00:25:59,730
It's a dick! Chorizo and the huevos!

330
00:25:59,941 --> 00:26:01,602
It's a big stiffy!

331
00:26:02,344 --> 00:26:03,606
It's a penis!

332
00:26:04,012 --> 00:26:07,345
Penis maximus! A willie!
Mr. Jiggle Daddy!

333
00:26:07,549 --> 00:26:09,176
Get him out of here!

334
00:26:09,384 --> 00:26:11,682
The one-eyed wonder weasel!

335
00:26:11,953 --> 00:26:14,888
It's Jimmy and the twins.
Rumple Foreskin.

336
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:18,218
He made this.
It's made from dil-dough.

337
00:26:18,426 --> 00:26:19,688
Wave bye-bye!

338
00:26:20,362 --> 00:26:21,954
Thanks for visiting!

339
00:26:23,431 --> 00:26:25,262
Let go of me!

340
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:29,167
I'm Rainbow-fucking-Randolph.
I know the way--

341
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:50,549
I want to thank you all
for having this sit-down.

342
00:26:50,759 --> 00:26:55,628
We have wrinkles in the communication
and collaboration departments.

343
00:26:55,830 --> 00:27:00,494
I'm not pointing fingers. You start
pointing and someone gets poked.

344
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:04,604
It's not my intention to try
and poke...

345
00:27:04,806 --> 00:27:06,330
...either of you.

346
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:12,171
Anyhoo, this is my new agent,
Burke Bennett.

347
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:15,907
He has experience facilitating
in these situations.

348
00:27:16,117 --> 00:27:19,416
I think he'll help us through
this moment together.

349
00:27:19,621 --> 00:27:21,589
Here's Burke!

350
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:24,224
Thank you, Sheldon.

351
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:27,528
Frank, you see this guy?
Take a good look.

352
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:30,425
Because this guy saved your ass.

353
00:27:30,632 --> 00:27:33,430
Without him, you'd be
sitting in Kaplan's...

354
00:27:33,635 --> 00:27:36,126
...sucking club soda
through a paper straw...

355
00:27:36,338 --> 00:27:41,241
...while your table at 21 was occupied
by the new Marion Frank Stokes...

356
00:27:41,409 --> 00:27:43,400
...and his twat du jour.

357
00:27:43,611 --> 00:27:45,602
-Excuse me.
-No excuse for you.

358
00:27:45,814 --> 00:27:48,908
We've always made arrangements.
Why the fireworks?

359
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:53,346
I'm holding the gunpowder.
I represent the man who created...

360
00:27:53,555 --> 00:27:56,956
...owns and controls
every inch of Smoochy the Rhino.

361
00:27:57,158 --> 00:27:58,785
You seem to forget...

362
00:27:58,993 --> 00:28:03,020
...we found this guy, dug up
his corpse, handed him a show...

363
00:28:03,231 --> 00:28:05,426
...when he couldn't sell his face.

364
00:28:05,633 --> 00:28:09,069
No, a lot of people
went out for that clinic gig.

365
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:12,205
-They hired me....
-Let me untangle this web.

366
00:28:12,741 --> 00:28:16,040
I don't care if his last job
was juggling apples...

367
00:28:16,244 --> 00:28:18,178
...for Pygmies in the Congo.

368
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:21,907
This man fits the bill
and you need him.

369
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:24,748
He'll get what he deserves.

370
00:28:25,053 --> 00:28:27,886
And what would that be, exactly?

371
00:28:28,857 --> 00:28:32,918
To the star and new executive producer
of The Smoochy Show.

372
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:35,028
I'm still in shock.

373
00:28:35,897 --> 00:28:40,561
Run me through this again.
I have complete creative control.

374
00:28:40,769 --> 00:28:44,330
Veto power over merchandising.
Corporate penthouse.

375
00:28:44,539 --> 00:28:46,029
Cushy.

376
00:28:46,241 --> 00:28:48,505
I must be dreaming.

377
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:51,770
Think of it as the high life.
Get used to it.

378
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:57,145
You'll be pissing on $100 bills just
to see the look on Franklin's face.

379
00:28:57,786 --> 00:29:01,916
I couldn't. I have too much respect
for what he accomplished.

380
00:29:03,691 --> 00:29:06,285
Yeah, he's a good man.

381
00:29:06,761 --> 00:29:08,820
-What's this?
-Keep it down.

382
00:29:09,397 --> 00:29:12,696
-What did you do, you snake?
-A graduation present.

383
00:29:15,637 --> 00:29:18,538
Think of it as a tool of the trade.

384
00:29:19,641 --> 00:29:21,768
-I can't accept this.
-No?

385
00:29:22,477 --> 00:29:25,674
-I don't believe in guns.
-Really?

386
00:29:26,314 --> 00:29:30,774
When we'd play cowboys and Indians
as kids, I was a Chinese rail worker.

387
00:29:31,119 --> 00:29:35,385
Trust me, it's a handy accessory
to have in this business.

388
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:37,624
Let me get that for you.

389
00:29:37,826 --> 00:29:39,418
Oh, boy.

390
00:29:39,627 --> 00:29:42,562
When this guy comes over,
don't talk to him...

391
00:29:42,764 --> 00:29:45,255
...or he'll stay here
yakking all night.

392
00:29:45,467 --> 00:29:46,559
Love that one.

393
00:29:46,768 --> 00:29:50,204
-Is that Spinner Dunn, the boxer?
-Fried beans.

394
00:29:50,405 --> 00:29:54,535
You don't retire with an 81 -and-59
record and end up governor.

395
00:29:54,742 --> 00:29:57,973
He's gotta be smart
to run a place like this.

396
00:29:58,146 --> 00:30:00,910
Spinner? He couldn't run
a water faucet.

397
00:30:01,115 --> 00:30:05,245
He's a mascot. It's his cousin,
Tommy Cotter. Heavy hitter.

398
00:30:05,453 --> 00:30:09,253
Her and her boys, they run the joint.
Irish mob.

399
00:30:09,524 --> 00:30:11,185
How do you like that?

400
00:30:11,826 --> 00:30:14,090
Strawberries and....

401
00:30:17,198 --> 00:30:18,927
Here he comes.

402
00:30:22,103 --> 00:30:24,936
Smoochy! Hey, I'm Spinner!

403
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:30,434
-I'm so excited to meet you!
-I'm excited to meet you too, Spinner.

404
00:30:31,112 --> 00:30:33,080
-I'm Spinner.
-Right.

405
00:30:34,883 --> 00:30:38,717
-You're a fan of the show.
-Smoochy, you know what I love?

406
00:30:39,053 --> 00:30:43,922
I love when you do
the Jiggy Ziggy dance, you know?

407
00:30:44,125 --> 00:30:46,525
The one you do during Silly Time?

408
00:30:46,728 --> 00:30:49,094
That's one of our big numbers.

409
00:30:51,566 --> 00:30:53,431
You wanna see me do it?

410
00:30:53,635 --> 00:30:56,866
-See you do the Jiggy Ziggy?
-Yeah!

411
00:30:57,071 --> 00:30:58,299
Sometime.

412
00:30:58,506 --> 00:31:00,269
I'll do it for you here.

413
00:31:00,475 --> 00:31:03,603
Smoochy, I'll do it, watch.

414
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:11,946
-Excuse me, senator.
-Sure.

415
00:31:12,587 --> 00:31:15,454
-I love you so much.
-I love you too.

416
00:31:16,858 --> 00:31:18,450
-I'm Spinner.
-Right.

417
00:31:18,893 --> 00:31:22,329
Hey, Spinner.
Come here and meet the senator.

418
00:31:24,332 --> 00:31:26,800
You go ahead. It was a real honor.

419
00:31:27,001 --> 00:31:30,164
-Smoochy's here!
-That's nice for you.

420
00:31:31,573 --> 00:31:34,633
Wait till I tell my folks
I met Spinner Dunn.

421
00:31:34,842 --> 00:31:37,777
-The one and only.
-Seems like a sweet guy.

422
00:31:38,613 --> 00:31:43,573
Don't go anywhere, Smoochy.
I'll be right back after I take a dump.

423
00:31:44,419 --> 00:31:47,115
I think you made a new friend, kid.

424
00:31:48,723 --> 00:31:53,956
Since Randolph got pinched, there's air
in the pipes. How are you fixing it?

425
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:58,895
The rhino's still a little green.
Eventually, he'll come around.

426
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:02,001
He has to get a taste
of how we do things.

427
00:32:02,203 --> 00:32:06,435
I have no time for "eventually."
Eventually, we get old and die.

428
00:32:06,641 --> 00:32:09,075
Sometimes "old" doesn't happen.

429
00:32:09,277 --> 00:32:12,769
I'm doing my best.
The network is watching closely.

430
00:32:12,981 --> 00:32:14,778
You got a problem, son.

431
00:32:15,083 --> 00:32:18,644
The rhino better learn
to play ball, and soon.

432
00:32:18,886 --> 00:32:22,720
Otherwise, he might need
a little coaching.

433
00:32:23,891 --> 00:32:28,658
Wipe your forehead, Frank.
You got plenty of time to sweat.

434
00:32:42,877 --> 00:32:46,108
-Who is it?
-Open up, baby, it's Randolph.

435
00:32:46,314 --> 00:32:48,305
It's been a long time.

436
00:32:52,987 --> 00:32:55,353
-Randy?
-Angie. Fucking traitor!

437
00:32:55,757 --> 00:32:59,284
-You left me for the rhino!
-I gotta eat, don't I?

438
00:32:59,494 --> 00:33:04,090
You strapped that horn on pretty fast!
You're a Krinkle Kid, say it!

439
00:33:04,298 --> 00:33:07,461
-Rhinette.
-Say it. "I am a Krinkle Kid."

440
00:33:07,669 --> 00:33:11,105
Say it before God
and all the bones of the saints!

441
00:33:12,073 --> 00:33:13,973
I'm a Rhinette, got that?!

442
00:33:14,175 --> 00:33:18,202
The Krinkle Kids
are 10 feet under. With you.

443
00:33:19,013 --> 00:33:21,038
I missed you so much!

444
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:25,709
Can I stay here?
I got no place else to go.

445
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:32,052
They kicked me out of the penthouse.
Sons of bitches.

446
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,818
That's how I got this.

447
00:33:34,028 --> 00:33:38,522
I got liens, back taxes, lawyers'
bills, threats against my life.

448
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:42,031
I got the whole world
up my fucking ass!

449
00:33:42,637 --> 00:33:46,698
Don't you worry.
I got a long memory, baby.

450
00:33:46,908 --> 00:33:52,642
Because what they sow,
they going to reap, Angie!

451
00:33:58,086 --> 00:34:01,544
Stop doing this.
Don't piss your life away.

452
00:34:01,756 --> 00:34:04,782
But it's the rhino, Angie.

453
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:08,729
The devil sent him from hell
to destroy me.

454
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:13,457
Smoochy is the face of evil.

455
00:34:35,790 --> 00:34:37,724
Congratulations, Sheldon.

456
00:34:37,925 --> 00:34:40,951
-Congratulations, Mr. Mopes.
-Thanks a lot.

457
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:44,723
Mr. Mopes, let me get that for you.

458
00:34:44,966 --> 00:34:49,096
Your office is over here.
If you need anything, let me know.

459
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:52,272
No, I gotta work tonight. I can't.

460
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:53,997
I'll come Sunday.

461
00:34:54,208 --> 00:34:55,573
Okay. That's--

462
00:34:56,310 --> 00:34:59,211
I want to talk to you
for a little bit.

463
00:34:59,413 --> 00:35:03,213
Ma, can I call you back?
Some asshole's screaming at me.

464
00:35:03,384 --> 00:35:04,578
Thanks. Bye.

465
00:35:04,952 --> 00:35:07,716
-Yeah?
-You didn't have to get off.

466
00:35:07,889 --> 00:35:10,824
-lf I didn't, you'd still be here.
-I am.

467
00:35:11,492 --> 00:35:13,392
I'm hoping to correct that.

468
00:35:14,695 --> 00:35:16,629
Listen, Nora.

469
00:35:17,131 --> 00:35:21,124
I can understand it might feel
a little awkward for you...

470
00:35:21,335 --> 00:35:24,998
...maybe intimidating,
now that the power has changed.

471
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:29,370
I still value your input.
And I consider you a partner.

472
00:35:29,577 --> 00:35:34,571
Never. Even if I live to be 1000
and see the second coming of Christ.

473
00:35:34,782 --> 00:35:38,741
I know we're not partners yet.
Let's make a game plan.

474
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:43,554
Let's pencil in a few lunch dates,
or go on a retreat!

475
00:35:43,758 --> 00:35:45,589
Just you and me, alone.

476
00:35:45,793 --> 00:35:48,227
Chewing the fat, exchanging ideas.

477
00:35:48,429 --> 00:35:51,227
Let's plant the seeds
of a collaboration.

478
00:35:51,432 --> 00:35:52,524
Plant this!

479
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:56,794
You know, Nora...

480
00:35:57,138 --> 00:35:59,868
...has anyone ever
suggested to you that yoga...

481
00:36:00,074 --> 00:36:02,702
...maybe a high colonic,
could loosen you up?

482
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:05,174
-Get out, hippie!
-You get out!

483
00:36:05,379 --> 00:36:06,573
You get out!

484
00:36:06,781 --> 00:36:11,343
You don't get to tell this boy
what to do anymore, you uptight....

485
00:36:15,857 --> 00:36:17,484
I'm gonna halt here.

486
00:36:17,692 --> 00:36:22,994
HALTis a self-recognition technique.
Hungry, angry, Ionely, tired.

487
00:36:23,197 --> 00:36:26,257
I won't get sucked
into your negative energy.

488
00:36:26,467 --> 00:36:30,597
Want me? I'll be in my office.
It's the big one. With a view.

489
00:36:30,805 --> 00:36:34,764
-They all have views, dumbshit!
-Not looking this way!

490
00:36:34,942 --> 00:36:36,239
Don't shut my door!

491
00:36:41,949 --> 00:36:44,008
Hey....

492
00:36:45,353 --> 00:36:48,550
"Have a long and healthy run. Burke."

493
00:36:48,756 --> 00:36:50,917
My own patch of wheat grass.

494
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:53,559
Morning! Congrats on the bump.

495
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:56,756
Spinner has taken a real shine to you.

496
00:36:56,964 --> 00:37:01,333
Since you come in, he can't stop
yakking, "Smoochy this, Smoochy that."

497
00:37:01,535 --> 00:37:05,266
That's nice. I like Spinner.
He's very sweet for such a...

498
00:37:06,741 --> 00:37:08,003
...big fella.

499
00:37:09,443 --> 00:37:13,539
-Can you give him a little floor space?
-Floor space?

500
00:37:13,748 --> 00:37:17,240
A part on the show.
You're the executive producer.

501
00:37:17,451 --> 00:37:19,715
You call the shots, right?

502
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:22,186
Yes. Yes, I do.

503
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:26,224
The thing is, television
is a very complicated medium.

504
00:37:26,427 --> 00:37:30,523
Not just anybody can be
a success at it. I like Spinner.

505
00:37:30,731 --> 00:37:36,601
But his chances on television are
as good as mine in the ring with him.

506
00:37:36,804 --> 00:37:39,364
Know what I'm saying?
It'd be painful.

507
00:37:39,573 --> 00:37:41,370
This makes me very sad.

508
00:37:41,575 --> 00:37:43,702
-What's wrong?
-Nothing. I'm just...

509
00:37:43,911 --> 00:37:45,845
...very sad right now.

510
00:37:46,047 --> 00:37:48,379
Who made you sad, Tommy?

511
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:51,379
I don't like to mention names.

512
00:37:55,022 --> 00:37:57,286
Say, fellas, I just remembered.

513
00:37:57,491 --> 00:38:00,927
We got a part
Spinner would be perfect for.

514
00:38:01,128 --> 00:38:02,652
That's the solution.

515
00:38:02,863 --> 00:38:05,991
You're a good boy. We remember favors.

516
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:09,658
You're welcome at our place anytime.
Come on, boys.

517
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:11,895
Okay.

518
00:38:12,106 --> 00:38:14,370
Thanks for stopping by.

519
00:38:16,877 --> 00:38:17,866
Hello?

520
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:20,912
Better grow eyes on
the back of your head.

521
00:38:21,115 --> 00:38:24,573
I won't sleep until worms
are crawling up your ass!

522
00:38:24,785 --> 00:38:29,449
I'm going on safari, motherfucker!
Safari!

523
00:38:31,325 --> 00:38:33,691
Gee whiz. What a day!

524
00:38:34,762 --> 00:38:36,127
Do you ever knock?

525
00:38:36,330 --> 00:38:39,026
Congratulations on your ice show.

526
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,634
-Sellout!
-What are you talking about?

527
00:38:41,836 --> 00:38:45,738
About you, and how you're a phony
like all the rest.

528
00:38:46,107 --> 00:38:48,667
"I'm Smoochy. I don't care about money.

529
00:38:48,876 --> 00:38:52,505
It's about a good show
without bells and whistles."

530
00:38:52,713 --> 00:38:56,274
You look good
with your foot stuck in your mouth.

531
00:38:56,484 --> 00:38:59,248
Jam it in there nice and tight.

532
00:38:59,453 --> 00:39:02,251
What happened to your
precious integrity?

533
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:05,923
Or is that just part
of your dog-and-pony show?

534
00:39:12,666 --> 00:39:14,429
I never agreed to a show!

535
00:39:14,668 --> 00:39:18,126
Do you realize the shekels
we can take in?

536
00:39:18,339 --> 00:39:21,934
These things represent
everything I'm against.

537
00:39:22,176 --> 00:39:26,806
Mindless spectacles whose purpose
is peddling overpriced sugar water...

538
00:39:27,014 --> 00:39:29,949
...and cheap plastic toys
that splinter...

539
00:39:30,151 --> 00:39:32,779
...and get lodged in some kid's septum.

540
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:36,649
-Where's our dignity?
-I know you got an ethics fetish.

541
00:39:36,857 --> 00:39:40,054
You can't change the world, buddy.

542
00:39:40,327 --> 00:39:41,988
But you can make a dent.

543
00:39:42,363 --> 00:39:45,093
No one has ever refused an ice show.

544
00:39:45,299 --> 00:39:48,598
Until now. Smoochy doesn't sell out.
That's it!

545
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:52,261
You should be proud to have a client
who can say that.

546
00:39:52,473 --> 00:39:54,441
Yeah, I'm doing backflips.

547
00:40:18,265 --> 00:40:21,860
Wasn't that fun, in an
awkward sort of way?

548
00:40:24,371 --> 00:40:26,032
It sure was!

549
00:40:28,342 --> 00:40:31,140
Did I do good? I did good, right?

550
00:40:31,345 --> 00:40:34,872
-You did great, buddy.
-I'm gonna go get drunk now.

551
00:40:35,316 --> 00:40:36,715
Okay, be careful.

552
00:40:36,917 --> 00:40:39,647
-Hey, lady.
-Hey, nice job.

553
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:42,322
Casting mental patients.
I like that.

554
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:46,015
Cut that out. Golly, he's not
a mental patient.

555
00:40:46,227 --> 00:40:49,958
He's a nightclub owner and an
ambassador for his sport.

556
00:40:50,164 --> 00:40:53,622
He just has the sweet disposition
of a 5-year-old.

557
00:40:53,834 --> 00:40:56,200
And a cousin named Tommy Cotter.

558
00:40:56,403 --> 00:40:59,201
At least he's got a sense of humor!

559
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:03,071
That's more than I can say
for some people.

560
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:10,179
What?

561
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:18,885
-Hi, there.
-How are you doing?

562
00:41:19,093 --> 00:41:20,993
Get in.

563
00:41:21,629 --> 00:41:23,688
That's okay. I'll grab a cab.

564
00:41:24,632 --> 00:41:26,156
Humor me, rhino.

565
00:41:28,836 --> 00:41:31,236
How do you like that?

566
00:41:34,341 --> 00:41:36,502
Merv Green. Nice to meet you.

567
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:39,304
Ever try saying that without the gun?

568
00:41:39,513 --> 00:41:43,609
I represent the Parade of Hope.
Maybe you've heard of us.

569
00:41:43,817 --> 00:41:49,084
-You raise money for hospitals.
-We've added a brick or two.

570
00:41:49,256 --> 00:41:53,386
There's talk that you're pulling out
of the ice show. True?

571
00:41:53,561 --> 00:41:57,395
I'm not "pulling out," because
I never agreed to do a show.

572
00:41:57,598 --> 00:42:00,328
Nor would I ever agree
to do a show and...

573
00:42:00,534 --> 00:42:02,559
...how is that your concern?

574
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:06,831
The Parade of Hope has sponsored
every ice show since 1964.

575
00:42:07,041 --> 00:42:09,805
We take a little, everyone's happy.

576
00:42:10,010 --> 00:42:11,807
So let's not buck history!

577
00:42:12,012 --> 00:42:16,244
For the gazillionth time, I have
no interest in doing a show!

578
00:42:16,483 --> 00:42:20,283
If that's all, let me out
and we can say happy trails.

579
00:42:20,487 --> 00:42:22,284
Can I have the far corner?

580
00:42:22,489 --> 00:42:26,220
Tomorrow, Smoochy raises his baton
for Parade of Hope.

581
00:42:26,427 --> 00:42:29,419
Banquets, benefits, I want it all.

582
00:42:31,498 --> 00:42:32,795
You can pull over.

583
00:42:36,570 --> 00:42:40,666
As far as the ice show goes,
I suggest you shop for skates.

584
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:49,781
This is unacceptable!
I'm calling the authorities!

585
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:54,250
Don't. Rat on them and you'll
be lucky to find your toenails.

586
00:42:54,455 --> 00:42:56,514
They're the roughest charity.

587
00:42:56,724 --> 00:42:58,919
You haven't been listening!

588
00:42:59,126 --> 00:43:03,859
I was threatened by an organization
that's supposed to help children.

589
00:43:04,064 --> 00:43:07,158
-What kind of world is this?
-The real one.

590
00:43:07,368 --> 00:43:11,600
My advice? Consider the ice show
and stay healthy.

591
00:43:12,539 --> 00:43:14,871
Well, how do you like that?

592
00:43:17,211 --> 00:43:19,145
-Hi.
-What did I do now?

593
00:43:19,346 --> 00:43:20,677
Can I come in?

594
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:23,115
Sure.

595
00:43:23,450 --> 00:43:26,385
-Everything okay?
-I'm drunk.

596
00:43:26,587 --> 00:43:29,055
Not that I want
to make you feel bad...

597
00:43:29,256 --> 00:43:32,748
...but with alcohol, you're
consuming empty calories.

598
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,791
I came here to apologize.

599
00:43:34,995 --> 00:43:36,121
-Really?
-Yes.

600
00:43:36,330 --> 00:43:40,790
And on these rare occasions
when I feel the need to apologize...

601
00:43:41,001 --> 00:43:43,868
...it helps if I'm shitfaced.

602
00:43:44,538 --> 00:43:49,100
-I'm supposed to feel honored?
-I may have been harsh the other day.

603
00:43:49,310 --> 00:43:50,834
A little out of line.

604
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:55,982
Don't worry. Last week you called me
a pasty-faced, no-talent hack.

605
00:43:56,183 --> 00:44:00,984
-You're not doing the ice show?
-No. Now I know what they're about.

606
00:44:01,188 --> 00:44:05,682
-Why didn't you tell me?
-I don't want to spoil all your fun.

607
00:44:05,926 --> 00:44:11,228
You get such a sparkly glow when you
berate me in front of everyone else.

608
00:44:11,598 --> 00:44:15,034
I may have become
a bit hardened over the years.

609
00:44:15,202 --> 00:44:16,260
I bet.

610
00:44:16,470 --> 00:44:21,430
Sincerity is an easy disguise.
It's hard to know who's on the level.

611
00:44:22,209 --> 00:44:24,006
That's true.

612
00:44:24,411 --> 00:44:28,211
I've been learning a lot
about that myself lately.

613
00:44:29,383 --> 00:44:34,184
"Sometimes light is really dark.
Sometimes crows can sing like larks."

614
00:44:34,388 --> 00:44:38,552
"Sometimes winter feels like spring.
Don't think you know everything."

615
00:44:38,759 --> 00:44:41,227
-Rickets the Hippo?
-You remember him?

616
00:44:41,428 --> 00:44:44,955
When I was a kid, he was
the one face I could trust.

617
00:44:45,165 --> 00:44:48,066
He was my inspiration
to work in kids TV.

618
00:44:48,268 --> 00:44:52,432
Me too! I took an anger management
class in college...

619
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:57,370
...we had to name a person representing
love and patience. I named him.

620
00:44:57,578 --> 00:45:02,072
-He's the reason I created Smoochy!
-I don't believe this!

621
00:45:02,282 --> 00:45:06,082
When I tell people about Rickets,
they look at me weird.

622
00:45:06,286 --> 00:45:09,983
He was the best!
You remember the Klunky-Wunky?

623
00:45:10,190 --> 00:45:12,988
I did it for my first Holy Communion.

624
00:45:13,193 --> 00:45:14,922
-Get out! You did not!
-Yes!

625
00:45:15,129 --> 00:45:16,824
You? The whole, like....

626
00:45:23,003 --> 00:45:25,733
From me to you

627
00:45:33,981 --> 00:45:36,142
-I should go.
-Wait.

628
00:45:37,184 --> 00:45:40,415
-Stay a while. I got Rickets on tape.
-It's late.

629
00:45:40,621 --> 00:45:43,818
You sure? I got some fennel tea.
We can hang out.

630
00:45:44,024 --> 00:45:47,084
-You should get that. Bye.
-It's okay.

631
00:45:48,695 --> 00:45:51,664
I'll see you down at the store.

632
00:45:54,201 --> 00:45:58,501
-Hello?
-Mr. Mopes? I'm Benjamin McKnucklepeck.

633
00:45:58,705 --> 00:46:04,007
I'm calling from Parents for Decency
in Children's TV. Have you heard of us?

634
00:46:04,211 --> 00:46:08,614
No, but that's an issue close
to my heart. I was just talking to--

635
00:46:08,816 --> 00:46:13,378
Tomorrow we're having a banquet.
We'd be honored if you performed.

636
00:46:13,587 --> 00:46:18,889
We want to present a plaque to you
for your commitment to children's TV.

637
00:46:19,126 --> 00:46:23,961
The presenter will be a young orphan
with mild asthma. Can you attend?

638
00:46:24,164 --> 00:46:25,859
Yeah, I'd be happy to.

639
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:28,297
That'd be great. See you then.

640
00:46:28,569 --> 00:46:31,697
I want to thank you for picking me up.

641
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:36,169
No worries. A chance to have
Smoochy at our soirée...

642
00:46:36,343 --> 00:46:39,574
...I'd stick my willie in a nest of
funnelwebs if I had to.

643
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:42,578
That sounds extreme.
Just try a "please."

644
00:46:42,783 --> 00:46:46,981
You're funny! There's vodka and chips
back there if you're hungry.

645
00:46:47,187 --> 00:46:52,318
I don't know if you're aware of it,
but food like that can lower your chi.

646
00:46:52,526 --> 00:46:56,087
I've never eaten Korean food.
Thanks for the information.

647
00:46:56,296 --> 00:46:59,265
That's why the wee ones
love your show.

648
00:46:59,466 --> 00:47:02,526
You can learn and laugh
at the same time.

649
00:47:02,736 --> 00:47:08,106
It's such a fresh change from that
dreadful embezzler, Rainbow Randy.

650
00:47:08,308 --> 00:47:10,902
-What was his name?
-Randolph, I think.

651
00:47:11,378 --> 00:47:15,212
Randolph! That's the scoundrel.
Probably gay too.

652
00:47:16,350 --> 00:47:17,578
What did you say?

653
00:47:17,784 --> 00:47:20,651
He's a pillow biter, you know?
The old....

654
00:47:20,854 --> 00:47:23,880
I don't know about
his sleeping disorders.

655
00:47:24,091 --> 00:47:29,358
But I do think he's got some problems,
alcohol and anger to name a few.

656
00:47:29,563 --> 00:47:30,791
What do you mean?

657
00:47:30,998 --> 00:47:34,195
I feel sorry for him. He has issues.

658
00:47:34,401 --> 00:47:39,361
But don't you take a particular glee
in the fact you stole his time slot...

659
00:47:39,573 --> 00:47:42,406
...and you're shoveling dirt
on his corpse?

660
00:47:42,609 --> 00:47:46,238
No. I wouldn't take pleasure
in someone's misfortune.

661
00:47:46,446 --> 00:47:49,415
Truth is, I thought
he was pretty talented.

662
00:47:49,616 --> 00:47:54,576
He's a miserable cocksucker! A fucking
asshole! You hate him, admit it!

663
00:47:56,557 --> 00:47:58,991
Where did you say you're from?

664
00:48:10,504 --> 00:48:12,802
The wee ones are ready for you.

665
00:48:13,707 --> 00:48:15,504
I'm ready. Give me my ax.

666
00:48:15,709 --> 00:48:18,439
Here we go. Let's shake a stick.

667
00:48:18,679 --> 00:48:21,910
-This is really exciting for me.
-Me too.

668
00:48:22,115 --> 00:48:25,084
I never played
in a tractor parts warehouse.

669
00:48:25,285 --> 00:48:28,413
We keep it no-frills.
It's all about the wee ones.

670
00:48:28,622 --> 00:48:31,989
Great attitude.
I wish more people felt that way.

671
00:48:32,192 --> 00:48:34,820
-Know what my motto is?
-Something inane.

672
00:48:35,028 --> 00:48:38,589
"You can't change the world,
but you can make a dent."

673
00:48:38,799 --> 00:48:41,597
Don't worry.
You're going to make a dent.

674
00:48:41,802 --> 00:48:45,135
-Go out there and hook a horn!
-Thanks!

675
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:47,432
Auf Wiedersehen.

676
00:48:47,641 --> 00:48:51,600
-Smoochy the Rhino!
-Hello, New Jersey!

677
00:48:54,481 --> 00:48:56,711
It's great to be here, kids!

678
00:48:57,417 --> 00:48:59,385
Sing along if you know it.

679
00:48:59,586 --> 00:49:03,682
Friends, friends, we all got friends
You've got me and I got you

680
00:49:04,358 --> 00:49:09,057
Friends, friends, we all need friends
It's our pals that get us through

681
00:49:09,262 --> 00:49:13,392
If I had a dollar
For every friend I've made

682
00:49:18,171 --> 00:49:19,638
You know...

683
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:24,641
...it's a little hard to sing to your
friends when you can't see them.

684
00:49:25,979 --> 00:49:29,847
Could we just kill that spot
and bring the houselights up?

685
00:49:38,392 --> 00:49:39,654
Heil Smoochy!

686
00:49:50,837 --> 00:49:52,896
I hope I'm dreaming.

687
00:49:55,709 --> 00:49:58,269
Freeze!
This is an unlawful assembly!

688
00:49:58,912 --> 00:50:01,574
Hands on your head. Line up!

689
00:50:08,522 --> 00:50:12,515
-Do you read Mein Kampf?
-Is Smoochy code for "white power"?

690
00:50:12,726 --> 00:50:15,217
Is Adolf Hitler your personal hero?

691
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:18,330
-I don't hate anybody!
-You don't hate Nazis?

692
00:50:18,532 --> 00:50:21,592
How does it feel to be
a racist scumbag?

693
00:50:47,928 --> 00:50:51,386
Here at the Kidnet jungle,
the rhino's now extinct.

694
00:50:51,765 --> 00:50:56,896
The Smoochy slot will be
safely occupied by cartoon reruns.

695
00:51:13,687 --> 00:51:15,245
Hello, nipple-nibbler.

696
00:51:15,455 --> 00:51:17,685
The rhino's a Nazi.

697
00:51:18,158 --> 00:51:22,652
The rhino is screwed-o
The rhino is screwed

698
00:51:46,319 --> 00:51:47,650
Nora! Nora!

699
00:51:47,854 --> 00:51:51,620
-It's me. I gotta talk to you.
-There's nothing to say.

700
00:51:51,825 --> 00:51:53,793
They're calling me fascist.

701
00:51:54,094 --> 00:51:57,530
I'm being compared unfavorably
with Goebbels.

702
00:51:57,731 --> 00:52:00,291
Hey. If the jackboot fits....

703
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:02,832
You believe what they're saying?

704
00:52:03,036 --> 00:52:06,028
I don't have to.
The picture said it all.

705
00:52:06,239 --> 00:52:09,174
That was a setup. I'm telling you!

706
00:52:09,376 --> 00:52:12,539
This Fetalkunkle guy
said it was for kids.

707
00:52:12,746 --> 00:52:16,204
I had no idea it was a Nazi rally.

708
00:52:16,416 --> 00:52:20,546
You'd think the 50-foot swastika
might have given you a hint.

709
00:52:20,754 --> 00:52:23,814
That was later.
The light was in my eyes.

710
00:52:24,024 --> 00:52:27,323
It was like a nightmare.
Suddenly.... Wham!

711
00:52:27,527 --> 00:52:31,520
It's jackboots and Gestapo
and "Smooch Heil, Smooch Heil!"

712
00:52:31,731 --> 00:52:34,598
I need your help.
I'm in a pickle here.

713
00:52:35,035 --> 00:52:38,198
The fact is, I don't know you, okay?

714
00:52:38,772 --> 00:52:41,468
-What?
-Not really.

715
00:52:42,008 --> 00:52:45,569
Don't expect me to go out
on an emotional limb here.

716
00:52:45,779 --> 00:52:47,804
But, Nora....

717
00:52:48,715 --> 00:52:50,012
Nora!

718
00:52:50,584 --> 00:52:52,814
What about the Klunky-Wunky dance?

719
00:52:53,019 --> 00:52:56,750
I was drunk.
Don't read too much into it.

720
00:53:49,009 --> 00:53:53,537
If you want a cup of juice, the
well's dried up. City shut her down.

721
00:53:53,747 --> 00:53:57,979
Bastards will slap a new pair of tits
on the Statue of Liberty...

722
00:53:58,184 --> 00:54:03,349
...but they won't help a poor hophead.
Just once I wish I had a little clout.

723
00:54:03,690 --> 00:54:06,523
I'd set things straight in this town.

724
00:54:06,726 --> 00:54:08,717
Believe me.

725
00:54:11,464 --> 00:54:13,955
Hell of a world.

726
00:54:17,370 --> 00:54:19,736
Hell of a world.

727
00:54:35,922 --> 00:54:37,184
What do you want?

728
00:54:37,357 --> 00:54:42,260
Can you spare 60 seconds
for a smiley old face from your past?

729
00:54:44,164 --> 00:54:46,325
Hello, kitten.

730
00:54:48,301 --> 00:54:49,825
Here's the good news.

731
00:54:50,036 --> 00:54:52,061
You and Frank are in a bind.

732
00:54:52,272 --> 00:54:56,231
I'd be happy to end my sabbatical
and come back.

733
00:54:56,443 --> 00:55:01,005
I could start Monday. No meat.
When did you become a vegetarian?

734
00:55:01,214 --> 00:55:05,947
Call costumes and props and tell them
that the old R-man is back.

735
00:55:06,152 --> 00:55:09,144
Ready to start whistling tunes
for the kids.

736
00:55:09,356 --> 00:55:12,257
Whose toes you gotta suck
to get a drink?

737
00:55:12,459 --> 00:55:16,225
You got three seconds
to pry your ass off my couch.

738
00:55:16,429 --> 00:55:21,196
You need someone for that slot
and I'm here to reclaim what's mine.

739
00:55:21,434 --> 00:55:24,835
In case you forgot, you're a criminal
and a scumbag.

740
00:55:25,038 --> 00:55:28,201
Have you forgotten what we once had?

741
00:55:28,408 --> 00:55:31,866
That was a long time ago.
I was young and stupid.

742
00:55:32,078 --> 00:55:35,104
And limber. Why we broke up,
I'll never know.

743
00:55:35,281 --> 00:55:38,307
You were an asshole,
and I didn't love you.

744
00:55:38,518 --> 00:55:40,918
We could have worked through that.

745
00:55:41,721 --> 00:55:45,054
Goddamn it, Nora!
The public is clamoring for me.

746
00:55:45,725 --> 00:55:49,422
I'm a patriot compared to Mopes.
He's a Nazi and gay.

747
00:55:50,063 --> 00:55:52,964
He was checking me out in the car.

748
00:55:54,968 --> 00:55:56,629
-What's that mean?
-What?

749
00:55:56,836 --> 00:55:59,498
He was checking you out in what car?

750
00:55:59,739 --> 00:56:02,640
No, I'm just saying
it's a vibe, you know?

751
00:56:02,842 --> 00:56:07,609
Kind of a homosexual Nazi vibe.
Something that emanates from the TV.

752
00:56:07,814 --> 00:56:10,544
What's with the costume?
Big erect horn.

753
00:56:10,750 --> 00:56:12,183
You're talking fast.

754
00:56:12,385 --> 00:56:16,048
What do you mean? I'm not.
I still love you, Nora.

755
00:56:16,656 --> 00:56:18,954
Were you at that rally?

756
00:56:21,361 --> 00:56:24,125
You had something to do with this?

757
00:56:25,899 --> 00:56:27,628
Did you set Sheldon up?

758
00:56:27,834 --> 00:56:30,325
I know why we broke up now.

759
00:56:30,570 --> 00:56:34,529
Always with the accusations.
Bitch, bitch, bitch!

760
00:56:37,610 --> 00:56:39,840
I miss Smoochy.

761
00:56:40,046 --> 00:56:43,447
He couldn't have done the things
they say he done.

762
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:45,413
He ain't no Nazi.

763
00:56:46,753 --> 00:56:48,983
I want Smoochy back.

764
00:56:49,189 --> 00:56:53,148
I wanna be on the TV again.
I wanna play my cowbell.

765
00:56:54,861 --> 00:56:59,093
-Has Burke been here tonight?
-Haven't seen him. Can I help you?

766
00:56:59,299 --> 00:57:01,290
It's about Sheldon.

767
00:57:01,968 --> 00:57:03,697
Sheldon?

768
00:57:04,204 --> 00:57:06,604
Hey, what about Sheldon?

769
00:57:09,008 --> 00:57:14,105
I'm trying to sleep, asshole!
Read the fucking meter another time!

770
00:57:16,816 --> 00:57:21,185
Hello there, Mr. Rainbow.
How lovely to see you in the flesh.

771
00:57:21,387 --> 00:57:25,551
Come here.
You wanna tell me about the rhino?

772
00:57:25,758 --> 00:57:29,387
This is private property.
You're fucking trespassing.

773
00:57:30,864 --> 00:57:34,732
Danny, go give Mr. Smiley
a little backrub.

774
00:57:38,238 --> 00:57:39,500
Start yakking.

775
00:57:39,706 --> 00:57:42,072
What are you talking about?

776
00:57:42,342 --> 00:57:44,139
You're violating my--

777
00:57:52,452 --> 00:57:56,183
You spud-sucking fucks!
I'm suing your Riverdance ass!

778
00:57:56,656 --> 00:57:59,216
I'll send you all the way back home!

779
00:57:59,959 --> 00:58:04,089
-Roy, have you got the hammer?
-Always got the hammer, Tommy.

780
00:58:06,432 --> 00:58:09,333
I did it. It was me. It was all me.

781
00:58:09,569 --> 00:58:13,335
Thank God we cleared that up
without further violence.

782
00:58:22,515 --> 00:58:26,246
Don't touch me!
My name isn't Wandolph, it's Randolph.

783
00:58:26,452 --> 00:58:29,148
How is it being the most hated man
in America?

784
00:58:29,355 --> 00:58:32,415
In a country of Neanderthals,
it's an honor.

785
00:58:32,625 --> 00:58:35,685
Nora says you have
an obsession with Mopes.

786
00:58:35,895 --> 00:58:39,490
I barely know her.
She's been down on everything.

787
00:58:39,699 --> 00:58:41,860
She spreads like cream cheese.

788
00:58:42,068 --> 00:58:44,263
What about rumors that you're crazy?

789
00:58:44,470 --> 00:58:48,907
That's bullshit! I'm on the same
dosage I've always been.

790
00:58:49,142 --> 00:58:53,738
Between my client's dwindling cash
flow and mounting legal fees...

791
00:58:53,947 --> 00:58:56,279
...he's sinking into a depression.

792
00:58:56,482 --> 00:58:59,713
Who grabbed my ass?
Get away! Don't touch me!

793
00:59:01,054 --> 00:59:02,783
-Very nice.
-I've been shot!

794
00:59:02,989 --> 00:59:06,117
I'm bleeding! That's salmonella!

795
00:59:06,459 --> 00:59:09,758
Someone touched my ass.
I want room to breathe.

796
00:59:09,963 --> 00:59:11,396
Back off !

797
00:59:18,204 --> 00:59:21,196
Man, it's crazy out there.

798
00:59:21,908 --> 00:59:23,239
Listen...

799
00:59:23,443 --> 00:59:25,206
...I wanted to say I'm sorry.

800
00:59:25,411 --> 00:59:27,606
I'm sorry I didn't believe you.

801
00:59:27,814 --> 00:59:31,113
I got swept up in the frenzy
of anti-Smoochyism.

802
00:59:31,351 --> 00:59:36,448
It's a house of mirrors. You can't
always tell what you're looking at.

803
00:59:36,656 --> 00:59:37,782
Yeah.

804
00:59:37,991 --> 00:59:40,892
If it weren't for you,
I wouldn't be here.

805
00:59:41,594 --> 00:59:42,618
Thanks.

806
00:59:44,063 --> 00:59:45,325
Good.

807
00:59:45,531 --> 00:59:46,930
-Five minutes.
-Thanks.

808
00:59:48,201 --> 00:59:51,193
I don't know Spanish,
but thanks anyway.

809
00:59:51,904 --> 00:59:53,531
It means "good luck."

810
00:59:59,145 --> 01:00:00,908
Ladies and gentlemen...

811
01:00:01,114 --> 01:00:05,483
...boys and girls,
who's your favorite rhino?

812
01:00:16,095 --> 01:00:17,357
Smoochy!

813
01:00:26,839 --> 01:00:29,069
You guys are the greatest!

814
01:00:31,244 --> 01:00:36,079
Thanks, kids. Thanks a lot.
It's great to be back home with you.

815
01:00:36,282 --> 01:00:38,580
I know I was away for too long.

816
01:00:38,785 --> 01:00:41,913
You probably heard
I went through rough times.

817
01:00:42,121 --> 01:00:45,181
Life outside the Magic Jungle...

818
01:00:45,391 --> 01:00:47,723
...can get pretty complicated.

819
01:00:47,927 --> 01:00:50,623
A lot of ugliness and injustice.

820
01:00:50,830 --> 01:00:55,529
Sometimes being a good person....
Well, that just isn't always enough.

821
01:00:55,868 --> 01:01:00,100
And when that happens,
it is hard not to get frustrated.

822
01:01:01,140 --> 01:01:04,598
Maybe even start feeling
a little bitter.

823
01:01:05,678 --> 01:01:07,077
I'll just say it.

824
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:11,740
Sometimes, boys and girls,
it'll make you flat-out mad.

825
01:01:12,385 --> 01:01:15,786
You know what I do
when I get mad, boys and girls?

826
01:01:16,389 --> 01:01:19,358
When that pressure starts building...

827
01:01:19,559 --> 01:01:23,017
...to where I feel
I won't be able to take it anymore?

828
01:01:23,429 --> 01:01:27,126
And this rhino might have to put
hurt on someone?

829
01:01:27,767 --> 01:01:29,701
You know what I do then?

830
01:01:30,470 --> 01:01:33,064
I howl!
That's right.

831
01:01:33,272 --> 01:01:37,641
I take all the things I don't like
and I let out a big howl.

832
01:01:44,784 --> 01:01:47,446
Come on and howl with me now.

833
01:01:51,023 --> 01:01:52,285
Howl it out!

834
01:01:53,126 --> 01:01:55,560
Take all that frustration inside...

835
01:01:55,762 --> 01:01:59,459
...ball it up and let it out in a howl!

836
01:02:29,128 --> 01:02:30,993
Thanks a lot, kids.

837
01:02:31,431 --> 01:02:33,695
I feel much better now.

838
01:02:34,300 --> 01:02:37,133
So who wants to do the Jiggy Ziggy?

839
01:02:48,214 --> 01:02:51,877
Smoochy is back!
And boy, did we miss him.

840
01:02:52,151 --> 01:02:54,278
Shut up!

841
01:02:54,954 --> 01:02:57,514
Bad. Very bad.

842
01:03:00,693 --> 01:03:03,992
Too much for brain. Pressure building.

843
01:03:04,330 --> 01:03:07,026
His popularity
is stronger than ever....

844
01:03:07,233 --> 01:03:09,360
I despise you!

845
01:03:09,569 --> 01:03:12,037
I loathe you!

846
01:03:14,774 --> 01:03:17,368
Bastard son of Barney!

847
01:03:19,879 --> 01:03:21,471
Die, you son of fluff !

848
01:03:22,081 --> 01:03:23,810
Illegitimate Teletubby!

849
01:03:24,617 --> 01:03:26,244
Die, Muppet from hell!

850
01:03:27,053 --> 01:03:29,044
Die, you foam motherfucker!

851
01:03:30,923 --> 01:03:34,051
What are you doing?
That's a picture-in-picture!

852
01:03:34,427 --> 01:03:37,521
-It was an accident.
-I want you out of here!

853
01:03:37,730 --> 01:03:39,755
Where am I supposed to go?

854
01:03:39,966 --> 01:03:43,993
-Put your slippers on and get out!
-Please! I need help!

855
01:03:44,303 --> 01:03:48,763
I don't care anymore. I helped you.
You abused it.

856
01:03:51,043 --> 01:03:54,240
-I missed you so much!
-I missed you too, pal.

857
01:03:54,447 --> 01:03:57,939
Sheldon, look, I been practicing
and practicing.

858
01:03:58,217 --> 01:04:01,709
I'm getting good at it.
You want to see me march?

859
01:04:01,921 --> 01:04:04,481
No, but you're going to anyway.

860
01:04:07,627 --> 01:04:09,117
You gotta love him.

861
01:04:11,631 --> 01:04:15,533
First, the good news.
I've given it thought and decided...

862
01:04:15,735 --> 01:04:18,397
...I am gonna do the ice show.

863
01:04:20,473 --> 01:04:23,931
Now I got a bar mitzvah boy!
That's a great decision.

864
01:04:24,143 --> 01:04:26,304
After everything, I realized...

865
01:04:26,512 --> 01:04:29,208
...it's a crime to waste your power.

866
01:04:29,415 --> 01:04:34,114
-Rock bottom is a college education.
-Ready for the really good news?

867
01:04:34,320 --> 01:04:35,685
I'm doing it myself.

868
01:04:35,888 --> 01:04:38,379
No sponsors, no vendors, no crooks.

869
01:04:38,558 --> 01:04:40,924
Not one dirty hand will touch this.

870
01:04:41,093 --> 01:04:44,062
No one's gonna make
a penny off of these kids.

871
01:04:44,230 --> 01:04:47,563
The Smoochy on Ice show
will be squeaky clean.

872
01:04:47,733 --> 01:04:52,363
As far as the refreshments go,
they will be provided by me.

873
01:04:52,538 --> 01:04:54,165
And for free.

874
01:04:54,340 --> 01:04:59,243
Sodium-free pretzels, apple slices,
organic smoothies. Everything healthy.

875
01:04:59,412 --> 01:05:02,609
-Wanna hear the best part?
-I'm holding my breath.

876
01:05:02,915 --> 01:05:07,215
Half the profits will go to
rebuild the Coney Island Drug Clinic!

877
01:05:07,386 --> 01:05:11,015
Are you telling me you wanna
give away half the profits?

878
01:05:11,190 --> 01:05:13,658
-Not half. AII.
-All the profits!

879
01:05:13,826 --> 01:05:17,091
The other half we use to fund
education programs.

880
01:05:17,263 --> 01:05:21,199
Big junkies come from little junkies.
We'll nip it in the bud.

881
01:05:21,367 --> 01:05:24,165
You can't do a show
and cut out the vendors.

882
01:05:24,337 --> 01:05:26,703
Not the Parade of Hope.
It's suicide.

883
01:05:26,872 --> 01:05:29,602
No, it's not.
You're the one who taught me.

884
01:05:29,775 --> 01:05:31,868
You got muscle,
you make the rules.

885
01:05:32,044 --> 01:05:35,502
I'll tell you something,
I'm feeling strong right now.

886
01:05:35,915 --> 01:05:38,509
I got my clout back
and I'm gonna use it.

887
01:05:39,018 --> 01:05:41,213
Make it happen.

888
01:05:43,189 --> 01:05:47,558
Shel, help me. He's banging
this thing from morning till night.

889
01:05:47,727 --> 01:05:51,754
I hate to take it, but I got a
headache from me eyes to me ass.

890
01:05:51,931 --> 01:05:55,264
I love Spinner, but I owe you.
I'll see what I can do.

891
01:05:55,434 --> 01:05:58,130
Give him something else
to do on the show.

892
01:05:58,304 --> 01:06:01,467
Anything. So long as it
don't clang, chime or honk.

893
01:06:01,641 --> 01:06:02,938
Bless you.

894
01:06:05,978 --> 01:06:07,605
Save the rhino!

895
01:06:07,947 --> 01:06:10,006
Save the rhino!

896
01:06:10,182 --> 01:06:13,015
Save the rhino!

897
01:06:13,185 --> 01:06:16,814
Save the rhino!
The African black rhino.

898
01:06:17,390 --> 01:06:19,153
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

899
01:06:19,492 --> 01:06:22,586
Before it's too late, make a donation!

900
01:06:23,262 --> 01:06:26,231
Thank you very much. Save the rhino--!

901
01:06:28,501 --> 01:06:31,937
I need saving!
Not that ottoman with a hood ornament!

902
01:06:32,772 --> 01:06:34,865
Save the Rainbow!

903
01:06:35,875 --> 01:06:39,367
Your client's put me
in a hazardous situation.

904
01:06:39,545 --> 01:06:43,106
A situation Merv Green holds me
accountable for.

905
01:06:43,282 --> 01:06:44,374
Enough said.

906
01:06:44,550 --> 01:06:47,781
Rhino's got me in a box
with no ventilation!

907
01:06:47,953 --> 01:06:51,150
I feel for you.
What can I do about it?

908
01:06:51,857 --> 01:06:53,950
I bring you in. On everything.

909
01:06:54,126 --> 01:06:57,653
You'd be my partner, down
the middle. Even ice shows.

910
01:06:57,830 --> 01:07:02,290
We got a chance to get back on track.
We gotta get rid of the rhino.

911
01:07:02,468 --> 01:07:03,799
The good old days.

912
01:07:03,969 --> 01:07:05,869
Pre-rhinoceros.

913
01:07:07,540 --> 01:07:09,201
Let me noodle it.

914
01:07:11,077 --> 01:07:12,704
No one freezes me out.

915
01:07:12,878 --> 01:07:15,312
I don't care how many clinics
he's saving.

916
01:07:15,481 --> 01:07:18,473
We gotta deal with this.
Rhino's out of control.

917
01:07:18,651 --> 01:07:21,051
You're aggravating me.

918
01:07:21,220 --> 01:07:23,051
I'm here to educate.

919
01:07:23,289 --> 01:07:28,090
Stokes will get an education
on the pH balance of the East River.

920
01:07:28,260 --> 01:07:32,629
This is about Mopes.
The rhino's become a menace.

921
01:07:32,832 --> 01:07:37,235
-He's talking to people he shouldn't.
-That's an ugly string of words.

922
01:07:37,403 --> 01:07:40,065
He thinks he'll clean up our business.

923
01:07:40,239 --> 01:07:43,072
There's only one way
out of this, partner.

924
01:07:48,614 --> 01:07:51,742
Boys, we have a serious problem.

925
01:07:53,853 --> 01:07:57,152
This is a story about
a venomous rhino...

926
01:07:57,423 --> 01:07:59,584
...and his aggressive campaign...

927
01:07:59,759 --> 01:08:03,251
...to slander, vilify,
defame, denigrate...

928
01:08:03,429 --> 01:08:06,262
...and villainize my good name!

929
01:08:06,799 --> 01:08:11,361
But the one thing he can't do
is take away my life.

930
01:08:11,637 --> 01:08:13,002
Only I can do that.

931
01:08:14,440 --> 01:08:16,101
Smoochy did this to me.

932
01:08:16,475 --> 01:08:20,377
I can no longer live in a world
where the innocent suffer...

933
01:08:20,646 --> 01:08:23,012
...and the wicked thrive!

934
01:08:37,229 --> 01:08:40,164
I'm sorry to put you through this,
my friends.

935
01:08:40,332 --> 01:08:43,529
Don't try and talk me out of this.

936
01:08:45,171 --> 01:08:49,335
You won't see another Rainbow Randolph
in this lifetime.

937
01:08:49,909 --> 01:08:52,036
This is for you, Smoochy!

938
01:08:52,378 --> 01:08:54,676
You did this to me!

939
01:09:03,422 --> 01:09:04,411
No!

940
01:09:05,991 --> 01:09:09,688
What you doing, Rainbow Randolph?

941
01:09:16,502 --> 01:09:17,935
It's okay.

942
01:09:23,943 --> 01:09:26,275
It's Smoochy! Come on!

943
01:09:27,847 --> 01:09:30,247
Come on, it's Smoochy.
Let's go.

944
01:09:43,762 --> 01:09:45,024
I love you!

945
01:09:50,035 --> 01:09:55,234
God! What does it all mean?!

946
01:09:55,674 --> 01:09:58,700
He slams the door, he stomps his feet

947
01:09:58,878 --> 01:10:02,177
Sends me to bed with zilch to eat

948
01:10:02,348 --> 01:10:07,285
But my stepdad's not mean
He's just adjusting

949
01:10:08,888 --> 01:10:13,825
His temper's bad and he's a slob
He's bitter cause he lost his job

950
01:10:14,293 --> 01:10:19,356
But my stepdad's not mean
He's just adjusting

951
01:10:19,565 --> 01:10:24,764
So three cheers for the man
That I proudly call Stan

952
01:10:25,170 --> 01:10:28,401
He's not quite a dad or a brother

953
01:10:28,874 --> 01:10:33,402
Yes, he gets cross
But still, he's the boss

954
01:10:33,579 --> 01:10:36,742
And besides he takes care of my mother

955
01:10:37,683 --> 01:10:41,050
Be patient with new friends like Stan

956
01:10:41,220 --> 01:10:44,348
It's tough to be Mom's second man

957
01:10:44,723 --> 01:10:49,956
But your stepdad's not mean
He's just adjusting

958
01:10:50,930 --> 01:10:54,559
So remember, kids, a stepdad
is a lot like a new puppy.

959
01:10:54,733 --> 01:10:58,362
They need patience while
they adjust to their surroundings.

960
01:10:58,537 --> 01:11:02,098
But remember, if he's ever abusive
to you or Mommy...

961
01:11:02,274 --> 01:11:04,299
...what are the magic numbers?

962
01:11:04,576 --> 01:11:06,703
911!

963
01:11:07,012 --> 01:11:08,445
That's right!

964
01:11:08,614 --> 01:11:11,208
Now, I am very excited...

965
01:11:11,383 --> 01:11:14,944
...to introduce a surprise visitor
to Jungle Land!

966
01:11:16,689 --> 01:11:21,023
Welcome, all the way from
the Lalwood Downs Rhino Preserve...

967
01:11:21,393 --> 01:11:23,258
...my cousin, Moochy!

968
01:11:29,101 --> 01:11:31,433
Come on down here, Mooch!

969
01:11:32,538 --> 01:11:35,530
You big drink of water! How are you?

970
01:11:36,575 --> 01:11:38,600
Thanks for coming all this way!

971
01:11:38,777 --> 01:11:41,712
Say hello to the boys
and girls out there.

972
01:11:50,285 --> 01:11:52,082
My name is Moochy.

973
01:11:52,955 --> 01:11:55,082
Yes, we've established that.

974
01:11:55,357 --> 01:11:58,053
This costume's
making my nuts itch.

975
01:12:07,469 --> 01:12:09,266
That was so much fun!

976
01:12:09,438 --> 01:12:10,928
Man, did you do great!

977
01:12:11,106 --> 01:12:13,973
And the ice show is
gonna be so much fun!

978
01:12:14,142 --> 01:12:18,579
I'm gonna skate out in circles
and then I'm falling on my ass!

979
01:12:21,049 --> 01:12:23,847
You're looking forward
to it, aren't you?

980
01:12:24,019 --> 01:12:28,012
Boy, being back at the coliseum,
back in the arena...

981
01:12:29,524 --> 01:12:32,982
...and with the crowds,
and they're just cheering...

982
01:12:33,161 --> 01:12:36,858
...it's gonna be like....
It's gonna be like heaven.

983
01:12:39,534 --> 01:12:41,525
It's gonna be great, champ.

984
01:12:42,738 --> 01:12:45,002
Sheldon, I love you.

985
01:12:45,173 --> 01:12:46,970
I love you too, buddy.

986
01:12:49,411 --> 01:12:52,380
I'll tell you,
I'll go to the locker room...

987
01:12:52,547 --> 01:12:56,142
...and take all my headgear off,
and you....

988
01:12:59,888 --> 01:13:02,186
Okay, okay. All right.

989
01:13:09,931 --> 01:13:12,058
He's excited about the ice show.

990
01:13:12,334 --> 01:13:14,996
I've been reading so much about it.

991
01:13:15,170 --> 01:13:17,764
We're getting a lot of ink.
It's great.

992
01:13:18,073 --> 01:13:20,405
It's great, what you're doing.

993
01:13:20,575 --> 01:13:21,564
Thanks.

994
01:13:22,244 --> 01:13:25,941
You inspired me to use my
juice to put that together.

995
01:13:26,214 --> 01:13:28,307
I really do appreciate that.

996
01:13:29,685 --> 01:13:30,913
Good.

997
01:13:33,121 --> 01:13:34,452
Thanks.

998
01:13:36,925 --> 01:13:40,292
-The stepfather segment went well.
-Oh, yeah?

999
01:13:40,629 --> 01:13:43,393
I don't know what was
going on with the....

1000
01:13:43,565 --> 01:13:46,534
The energy was just
really, really clicking.

1001
01:13:47,069 --> 01:13:48,263
Yeah.

1002
01:13:49,771 --> 01:13:52,069
Yeah.

1003
01:13:58,747 --> 01:14:02,444
You're not full of shit like
the others? You're for real?

1004
01:14:02,651 --> 01:14:03,811
Totally!

1005
01:14:04,619 --> 01:14:06,951
I mean, I couldn't tell.

1006
01:14:07,689 --> 01:14:09,782
First, I thought it was an act.

1007
01:14:12,828 --> 01:14:17,026
And then I just thought
you were a simp or something!

1008
01:14:17,199 --> 01:14:18,860
It's understandable.

1009
01:14:22,037 --> 01:14:24,403
There was the whole Nazi thing!

1010
01:14:24,573 --> 01:14:26,803
I forgive you for that.

1011
01:14:49,664 --> 01:14:51,598
What round is it?

1012
01:15:25,433 --> 01:15:29,096
Former heavyweight contender
Lawrence "Spinner" Dunn...

1013
01:15:29,271 --> 01:15:33,765
...was found shot to death in a
rhinoceros outfit early this morning.

1014
01:15:33,942 --> 01:15:36,069
How'd you hit the wrong rhino?

1015
01:15:36,244 --> 01:15:39,077
Who knew he had a cousin?
They're identical.

1016
01:15:39,247 --> 01:15:43,445
Smoochy's fuchsia, Moochy's burgundy!
Read a paper!

1017
01:15:43,618 --> 01:15:48,817
-You have to go back to kindergarten?!
-All you said was hit the rhino.

1018
01:15:48,990 --> 01:15:53,324
-I'm not taking the blame for this.
-I'm not through yet, rhino.

1019
01:15:53,929 --> 01:15:56,557
Your time will come!

1020
01:15:58,834 --> 01:16:03,134
-He wanted to be in the show so bad.
-Stop torturing yourself.

1021
01:16:03,338 --> 01:16:06,739
I'm sorry, Spinner. I'm so sorry.

1022
01:16:07,242 --> 01:16:09,335
-He loved you, Shel.
-I know.

1023
01:16:10,011 --> 01:16:13,845
I guarantee that fucking Randolph
has seen his last rainbow.

1024
01:16:14,015 --> 01:16:17,348
We'll cut off his balls
and shove them up his ass!

1025
01:16:17,519 --> 01:16:19,919
Maybe we should leave
it for the cops.

1026
01:16:20,088 --> 01:16:22,852
Cops won't do the ball thing.
Against policy.

1027
01:16:23,191 --> 01:16:25,489
Don't forget, this was meant for you.

1028
01:16:25,660 --> 01:16:28,254
From now on, everywhere you go, we go!

1029
01:16:28,430 --> 01:16:30,330
-I'll be fine.
-Fine, nothing!

1030
01:16:30,498 --> 01:16:34,127
As Christ is my witness,
no one's touching a hair on you!

1031
01:16:34,302 --> 01:16:37,601
-Spinner would've wanted it that way.
-Poor Spinner.

1032
01:16:37,772 --> 01:16:40,969
All right, boys. Let's go pray
and get shitfaced.

1033
01:16:41,142 --> 01:16:42,769
Yeah, you do that.

1034
01:16:43,979 --> 01:16:45,810
You have one for me, okay?

1035
01:16:46,481 --> 01:16:50,042
Try not to hurt anyone, Roy.
What would Jesus do?

1036
01:17:11,306 --> 01:17:13,866
How long was Randolph
in your apartment?

1037
01:17:14,042 --> 01:17:16,203
Just a couple of nights, officer.

1038
01:17:22,417 --> 01:17:23,679
Smoochy?

1039
01:17:25,220 --> 01:17:28,087
Tommy's here!
Tommy and her boys are here.

1040
01:17:35,330 --> 01:17:39,391
You sure? The cops have a lot
of evidence against Randolph.

1041
01:17:39,567 --> 01:17:41,296
We investigated ourselves.

1042
01:17:42,070 --> 01:17:46,063
Cousin lan from down at the morgue.
You met him at the wake.

1043
01:17:46,942 --> 01:17:50,537
See the neck?
Snapped like a twig. Animals.

1044
01:17:50,712 --> 01:17:53,613
Parade of Hope.
They like to sign the tab.

1045
01:17:53,782 --> 01:17:57,650
-What's that guy's name over there?
-Merv Green.

1046
01:17:59,220 --> 01:18:02,747
This is one tab they
should have left blank.

1047
01:18:03,258 --> 01:18:08,457
I knew he was a jizz-bag when he
grabbed my ass at Feed the Children.

1048
01:18:08,630 --> 01:18:14,068
Mr. Green will get a first-class ride
through the justice system.

1049
01:18:14,235 --> 01:18:15,964
It's all taken care of.

1050
01:18:16,438 --> 01:18:17,632
How do you mean?

1051
01:18:17,806 --> 01:18:22,743
Sometimes in this life, a man's got
to answer for his indiscretions.

1052
01:18:23,645 --> 01:18:28,878
It was a mistake. An honest mistake.
I was just trying to help the children!

1053
01:18:29,050 --> 01:18:31,712
-You like kids, huh?
-Sure, of course!

1054
01:18:31,886 --> 01:18:33,751
You know fairy tales then.

1055
01:18:33,922 --> 01:18:36,288
Tell him the one about the prick...

1056
01:18:36,458 --> 01:18:40,053
...that gets his head
chopped off with an ax!

1057
01:18:41,930 --> 01:18:43,124
No!

1058
01:18:50,839 --> 01:18:54,138
I don't feel so good about this
all of a sudden.

1059
01:18:54,309 --> 01:18:57,642
-We took his head and--
-Okay, that's definitely...

1060
01:18:57,812 --> 01:19:01,646
...more information than I care
to have at this point.

1061
01:19:02,817 --> 01:19:05,513
I'm having second thoughts.
I can't do it!

1062
01:19:05,687 --> 01:19:07,120
Relax, it's all good.

1063
01:19:07,288 --> 01:19:10,951
They found Merv's head in
the Grand Concourse.

1064
01:19:11,126 --> 01:19:13,424
We'll take the whole ball of wax.

1065
01:19:13,595 --> 01:19:16,359
Going in with Buggy Ding Dong's
a mistake!

1066
01:19:16,531 --> 01:19:19,864
Leave him to me. Once he does it,
the rhino's dead.

1067
01:19:20,035 --> 01:19:22,936
We light up the Macanudos!

1068
01:19:23,471 --> 01:19:24,938
Relax!

1069
01:19:25,673 --> 01:19:27,868
Where is our guest of honor?

1070
01:19:28,043 --> 01:19:30,375
-Our smack addict?
-It'll be fine!

1071
01:19:30,545 --> 01:19:33,981
We're relying on a smack addict.
Terrific.

1072
01:19:37,819 --> 01:19:41,414
Sorry I'm late, man.
I fell asleep at the bus station.

1073
01:19:41,689 --> 01:19:43,486
Looking good, Buggy.

1074
01:19:44,225 --> 01:19:47,820
Excuse me if I smell like piss.
You know how it is.

1075
01:19:48,763 --> 01:19:50,390
God help us.

1076
01:19:53,001 --> 01:19:54,764
-You want a drink?
-Vodka.

1077
01:19:56,404 --> 01:19:59,271
I do this thing tonight
and the spot's mine?

1078
01:19:59,474 --> 01:20:01,032
With a bow on it.

1079
01:20:01,209 --> 01:20:06,738
The thing is, we gotta put it to rest.
The rhino is up way past his bedtime.

1080
01:20:10,885 --> 01:20:11,874
Buggy?

1081
01:20:18,393 --> 01:20:20,452
We're in, right? We're set?

1082
01:20:20,628 --> 01:20:21,925
Sure.

1083
01:20:22,097 --> 01:20:24,395
Look at all the pretty lights.

1084
01:20:24,933 --> 01:20:28,391
Every cop's looking for you.
You have to stay put.

1085
01:20:29,070 --> 01:20:32,335
-I wanted to be a priest.
-I know.

1086
01:20:32,607 --> 01:20:34,734
Do you believe in angels?

1087
01:20:35,643 --> 01:20:40,103
I saw one in Times Square.
This little angel with curls.

1088
01:20:41,516 --> 01:20:44,451
She was the only one
that cared about me.

1089
01:20:44,619 --> 01:20:46,519
She saved my life.

1090
01:20:46,688 --> 01:20:50,920
You don't want to kill yourself.
You know that.

1091
01:20:51,092 --> 01:20:53,754
Perhaps it's time to heal.

1092
01:20:53,928 --> 01:20:58,592
Admit that Smoochy has won
and gracefully march forward.

1093
01:20:58,766 --> 01:21:02,862
Now you're talking.
This is a big step, I'm proud of you.

1094
01:21:03,037 --> 01:21:05,665
Did you bring lunch?
Chicken and stars?

1095
01:21:05,840 --> 01:21:07,171
Just like you asked.

1096
01:21:07,342 --> 01:21:12,279
-May I have some?
-For a smile.

1097
01:21:12,447 --> 01:21:14,711
Attaboy!

1098
01:21:14,883 --> 01:21:18,580
I got you some crossword puzzles
and stuff to read.

1099
01:21:32,467 --> 01:21:35,231
You okay?

1100
01:21:35,403 --> 01:21:40,397
First he takes my career,
then my life, now my girl.

1101
01:21:40,575 --> 01:21:42,736
She's not your girl anymore.

1102
01:21:42,911 --> 01:21:46,142
The balls on that fuchsia fuck!

1103
01:21:46,314 --> 01:21:50,341
I'll tear him apart! Piece by piece!

1104
01:21:50,518 --> 01:21:54,750
-Piece by piece!
-You said it's time to heal. Stop it.

1105
01:21:54,923 --> 01:21:57,483
I'll take him apart, hoof by hoof !

1106
01:21:57,659 --> 01:21:59,490
Horn by horn!

1107
01:21:59,661 --> 01:22:05,031
-Once and for all, now and forever!
-What happened to marching forward?

1108
01:22:05,200 --> 01:22:09,000
Motherfucker!

1109
01:22:17,946 --> 01:22:19,538
Yeah.

1110
01:22:19,714 --> 01:22:21,079
Can I help you?

1111
01:22:21,249 --> 01:22:23,149
I got news, Nora.

1112
01:22:23,318 --> 01:22:24,342
Buggy?

1113
01:22:24,519 --> 01:22:28,853
How you doing, apple cheeks?
Long time, no see.

1114
01:22:29,023 --> 01:22:32,390
-What are you doing?
-I got business with Stokes.

1115
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:33,549
Oh, yeah?

1116
01:22:33,728 --> 01:22:36,561
Yeah! He's gonna
put me back on the air.

1117
01:22:36,731 --> 01:22:40,963
He's gonna give me a shot.
I'm gonna take the rhino's place.

1118
01:22:41,135 --> 01:22:45,299
-What are you talking about?
-Buggy Ding Dong shall rise again.

1119
01:22:45,473 --> 01:22:51,673
Like a magnificent phoenix,
or some other town in Arizona.

1120
01:22:51,846 --> 01:22:54,542
I've always been smitten
with you, baby.

1121
01:22:54,716 --> 01:22:59,016
-Let me show you my Buggy bumper.
-Back off, Dracula!

1122
01:22:59,287 --> 01:23:02,017
Keep in touch.

1123
01:23:02,190 --> 01:23:05,182
Keep in touch.

1124
01:23:05,360 --> 01:23:08,523
Stokes cut a deal with Buggy
for the Smoochy slot.

1125
01:23:08,696 --> 01:23:12,325
Buggy Ding Dong, the host of
Buggy's Bumpy Railroad?

1126
01:23:12,500 --> 01:23:15,765
Until he discovered the joys of
black mule heroin.

1127
01:23:15,937 --> 01:23:19,395
Why would Stokes replace
Smoochy with a smack addict?

1128
01:23:19,574 --> 01:23:21,132
I don't know.

1129
01:23:21,309 --> 01:23:26,246
Somebody toss me a beach towel,
because my head is swimming.

1130
01:23:26,414 --> 01:23:28,848
What's up?!

1131
01:23:29,017 --> 01:23:32,043
Two for the price of one!
How convenient.

1132
01:23:32,220 --> 01:23:33,847
How serendipitous.

1133
01:23:34,022 --> 01:23:37,890
-Get the fuck out of here!
-You eat with that mouth?

1134
01:23:38,059 --> 01:23:43,053
-Okay, let's just all take it easy.
-Bite me, Buddha! I had her first.

1135
01:23:43,231 --> 01:23:45,426
-What?
-That's right, baby.

1136
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:49,536
You snatched her away,
now you gots to pay.

1137
01:23:49,704 --> 01:23:53,401
-Cork it, asshole!
-Wanna explain what this is about?

1138
01:23:53,574 --> 01:23:56,407
Didn't she tell you of the love
we once had?

1139
01:23:56,577 --> 01:23:59,842
Passionate, yet tender.
Old-fashioned, yet experimental.

1140
01:24:00,014 --> 01:24:02,175
Randolph, you've lost your mind.

1141
01:24:02,350 --> 01:24:06,719
Enlighten the lad, Nora! You were
such a hot little brood mare.

1142
01:24:06,888 --> 01:24:09,448
-Does the bridle still fit?
-Watch it--

1143
01:24:09,624 --> 01:24:12,388
Experiments?
I've had firmer handshakes.

1144
01:24:12,560 --> 01:24:16,155
Please. It's small, but it's fierce!

1145
01:24:16,331 --> 01:24:18,697
Hold the phone here.

1146
01:24:18,866 --> 01:24:22,131
Are you telling me this is true?
You and him?

1147
01:24:22,303 --> 01:24:25,238
No. You know, yeah.

1148
01:24:25,406 --> 01:24:28,307
How do you like that?

1149
01:24:28,476 --> 01:24:31,843
You're just an action figure
for her collection.

1150
01:24:32,013 --> 01:24:34,072
Shut up before I jaw you again.

1151
01:24:34,248 --> 01:24:38,582
I got Mr. Boomy, missy!
Tell him about Jingle Jackson.

1152
01:24:38,753 --> 01:24:40,880
You dated Jingle Jackson too?

1153
01:24:41,055 --> 01:24:43,853
She used to like to play
with his bells.

1154
01:24:45,526 --> 01:24:47,357
What about Wally the Whale?

1155
01:24:47,528 --> 01:24:50,088
How could you do it
with Wally?

1156
01:24:50,264 --> 01:24:52,494
There she blows!

1157
01:24:52,667 --> 01:24:56,660
I can't believe you didn't
tell me about this.

1158
01:24:56,838 --> 01:25:00,831
Listen, Sheldon, I'm not proud of it.

1159
01:25:01,008 --> 01:25:03,340
But there was a time in my life...

1160
01:25:03,511 --> 01:25:06,537
...when I was a bit
of a kiddie host groupie.

1161
01:25:06,714 --> 01:25:10,514
-My God, I feel dizzy.
-This has nothing to do with us!

1162
01:25:10,685 --> 01:25:14,678
You're different. It was another time.
I was another woman.

1163
01:25:14,856 --> 01:25:19,725
You've shown me a world
that I never thought could exist.

1164
01:25:19,894 --> 01:25:23,022
-Really?
-Yes.

1165
01:25:23,197 --> 01:25:25,529
What the fuck am I watching here?

1166
01:25:25,700 --> 01:25:28,931
Your little soap opera? Shut up!

1167
01:25:29,103 --> 01:25:31,571
This is my show!

1168
01:25:31,739 --> 01:25:34,674
Do you know the power
of a condemned man?

1169
01:25:35,009 --> 01:25:38,035
I don't think you want
to hurt anyone here.

1170
01:25:38,212 --> 01:25:42,410
Go blow yourself, Martha!
Look what you've done to this place.

1171
01:25:42,583 --> 01:25:45,780
Dian Fossey!
When I lived here, it was Bob Fosse!

1172
01:25:45,953 --> 01:25:49,889
There, I had a painting
of a naked chick holding a plant.

1173
01:25:50,057 --> 01:25:54,687
Very tasteful, no bush.
Not a picture of your mother!

1174
01:25:54,862 --> 01:25:58,696
We know you didn't kill Spinner,
so just cool your jets!

1175
01:25:58,866 --> 01:26:00,595
Thank you, Mother Teresa.

1176
01:26:00,768 --> 01:26:03,931
Tell that to the mob outside.
They want my ass!

1177
01:26:04,105 --> 01:26:08,439
I'm like a goddamn toaster at Macy's!
Randolph's ass, aisle three!

1178
01:26:08,609 --> 01:26:12,272
We'll go to the police tomorrow.
I'll explain everything.

1179
01:26:12,447 --> 01:26:16,975
It'll all work out fine.
Just trust me, Randolph.

1180
01:26:19,120 --> 01:26:23,454
Do not start with your
magician's tricks, young Moses!

1181
01:26:23,624 --> 01:26:28,152
I am Pharaoh! And you are my slave.

1182
01:26:28,329 --> 01:26:34,029
And this is my kingdom!

1183
01:26:34,202 --> 01:26:38,764
Rainbow Randolph is the man
Yes, oh, yes, he is

1184
01:26:38,940 --> 01:26:42,341
He's the prez of Rainbow Land
Yes, oh, yes, he is

1185
01:26:42,510 --> 01:26:45,479
With some fun, fun here
A laugh, laugh there

1186
01:26:45,646 --> 01:26:47,978
Here a dance, there a song
Everywhere is fun, fun

1187
01:26:48,149 --> 01:26:51,050
Rainbow Randolph is the king

1188
01:26:58,226 --> 01:26:59,955
-Get the gun.
-What?

1189
01:27:00,127 --> 01:27:05,087
Get the gun.

1190
01:27:05,266 --> 01:27:08,565
-You're hurting me!
-You wanna go down in flames?

1191
01:27:08,736 --> 01:27:11,705
The flames are too hot!
They're driving me mad!

1192
01:27:19,146 --> 01:27:21,273
Go ahead, kill me!

1193
01:27:21,849 --> 01:27:25,683
Go ahead, finish me off ! I'm nothing!

1194
01:27:25,853 --> 01:27:28,754
Put me out of my misery.

1195
01:27:28,923 --> 01:27:30,982
You're not nothing, all right?

1196
01:27:31,158 --> 01:27:35,458
You're bitter, misguided and you got
issues with sexual identity.

1197
01:27:35,630 --> 01:27:38,827
But you're Rainbow Randolph.
That's worth something.

1198
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:42,094
You've made a lot of children happy.

1199
01:27:44,372 --> 01:27:46,203
Will you be my friend?

1200
01:27:48,809 --> 01:27:50,902
Sure.

1201
01:27:51,078 --> 01:27:53,273
I love you both.

1202
01:27:54,649 --> 01:27:58,016
-You're going down to their level.
-I'm just wising up.

1203
01:27:58,185 --> 01:28:03,953
She's right. Don't make the same
mistake I did. Keep your dignity.

1204
01:28:04,125 --> 01:28:06,059
My balls! They're on fire!

1205
01:28:06,561 --> 01:28:11,464
I appreciate everybody's concern.
But I know what I'm doing.

1206
01:28:11,632 --> 01:28:12,894
I tried.

1207
01:28:13,067 --> 01:28:15,900
We gotta get to the arena
for the show.

1208
01:28:16,070 --> 01:28:19,733
You can stay here
as long as you like. You'll be safe.

1209
01:28:19,907 --> 01:28:23,206
-You've got a good man there.
-Just rest.

1210
01:28:23,377 --> 01:28:26,312
He's the real thing.
You're the real thing.

1211
01:28:26,614 --> 01:28:27,842
Thanks.

1212
01:28:28,015 --> 01:28:31,917
I'm a fraud. A wicked man
who's done wicked acts.

1213
01:28:32,086 --> 01:28:35,385
Well, it's like the song says:

1214
01:28:36,023 --> 01:28:38,491
"We all got our bad days."

1215
01:28:42,563 --> 01:28:44,360
-Buggy.
-Angelo.

1216
01:28:44,532 --> 01:28:47,865
What are you doing?!
I thought you cleaned up!

1217
01:28:48,035 --> 01:28:52,028
I did. I cleaned up half
the poppies in Asia.

1218
01:29:10,858 --> 01:29:13,759
-Can I get a pretzel?
-lf that's what you want.

1219
01:29:13,928 --> 01:29:15,919
With mustard. Everything's free.

1220
01:29:16,097 --> 01:29:18,031
-Here you go.
-Salt.

1221
01:29:18,199 --> 01:29:21,259
Sorry, our pretzels are salt-free.

1222
01:29:32,913 --> 01:29:35,381
-We should call it off.
-I can't.

1223
01:29:35,549 --> 01:29:40,145
There's a lot of kids and junkies
out there who are counting on me.

1224
01:29:40,321 --> 01:29:42,152
I got a job to do.

1225
01:29:44,458 --> 01:29:46,426
Come on, wish me luck.

1226
01:29:48,095 --> 01:29:49,585
-Hi?
-Randy, is that you?

1227
01:29:49,764 --> 01:29:53,063
What will you wear to the show?
I hope a thong.

1228
01:29:53,234 --> 01:29:56,761
-Buggy's been here.
-The Dong man?

1229
01:29:56,937 --> 01:29:59,735
He broke in and lifted
my backstage pass.

1230
01:29:59,907 --> 01:30:01,898
He's doing a job for Burke.

1231
01:30:02,076 --> 01:30:04,704
Gonna get a show
after the rhino's gone.

1232
01:30:04,879 --> 01:30:09,145
-He's higher than a prom dress in June.
-I got a bad feeling about this.

1233
01:30:09,316 --> 01:30:11,841
-No shit.
-I have to go to the show.

1234
01:30:12,019 --> 01:30:14,579
The cops will jump on you
like a trampoline.

1235
01:30:14,755 --> 01:30:17,553
Burke and Ding Dong
equals trouble.

1236
01:30:17,725 --> 01:30:19,488
I have to save the rhino.

1237
01:30:20,161 --> 01:30:21,492
Randy!

1238
01:30:22,430 --> 01:30:25,558
America's favorite rhino.
Ladies and gentlemen...

1239
01:30:25,733 --> 01:30:28,793
...boys and girls, here's Smoochy!

1240
01:30:35,276 --> 01:30:36,937
Thank you.

1241
01:30:37,678 --> 01:30:38,940
Thank you.

1242
01:30:39,447 --> 01:30:43,474
For myself and the soon-
to-be-restored methadone clinic...

1243
01:30:43,651 --> 01:30:46,347
...I want to thank you all
for being here.

1244
01:30:48,022 --> 01:30:50,013
Hip, hip, hooray.

1245
01:30:53,127 --> 01:30:56,790
You all came here to hear
your favorite Smoochy songs...

1246
01:30:57,064 --> 01:31:01,296
...but we've got something different,
something personal to me.

1247
01:31:01,702 --> 01:31:06,139
I've told you how important it is
to be honest about your feelings.

1248
01:31:06,474 --> 01:31:11,377
If I didn't share with you what
I've been feeling and going through...

1249
01:31:11,712 --> 01:31:15,273
...I wouldn't be a very honest rhino,
would I?

1250
01:31:15,716 --> 01:31:19,652
I'm going on a journey today
and I hope you'll come along.

1251
01:31:19,854 --> 01:31:22,379
You need your true friends
by your side.

1252
01:31:31,932 --> 01:31:34,264
This is for Spinner.

1253
01:33:05,292 --> 01:33:08,056
Don't let them get you, Smoochy!

1254
01:33:22,743 --> 01:33:24,973
It's Rainbow Randolph!

1255
01:33:25,145 --> 01:33:28,205
No, I just look like him.

1256
01:33:28,382 --> 01:33:32,113
I'm trying to save a friend
from a deranged junkie.

1257
01:33:32,286 --> 01:33:35,813
For the kids? Okay.
Friends come in all sizes.

1258
01:36:13,480 --> 01:36:15,277
Excuse me.

1259
01:36:20,154 --> 01:36:21,451
Goodbye, Smoochy.

1260
01:36:35,402 --> 01:36:38,235
You shot Smoochy, you bastard!

1261
01:36:39,573 --> 01:36:41,370
Give me the gun!

1262
01:36:41,542 --> 01:36:43,032
I've gotta kill him!

1263
01:36:48,982 --> 01:36:50,176
Get off of me!

1264
01:36:53,554 --> 01:36:54,816
Give me that gun!

1265
01:37:01,228 --> 01:37:02,217
It's Buggy!

1266
01:37:02,496 --> 01:37:05,488
-What do we do now?
-Survival of the fittest.

1267
01:37:07,634 --> 01:37:08,828
It's Buggy!

1268
01:37:11,505 --> 01:37:12,563
That's Randolph!

1269
01:37:12,873 --> 01:37:15,433
Let go of me, you fucking junkie!

1270
01:37:19,713 --> 01:37:21,943
I never saw Venice!

1271
01:37:32,926 --> 01:37:33,915
You okay?

1272
01:37:34,094 --> 01:37:37,825
I'm fucked up in general,
so it's hard to gauge.

1273
01:37:39,700 --> 01:37:41,600
It's Burke, he set you up!

1274
01:37:41,902 --> 01:37:44,302
He tried to kill you! There he is!

1275
01:37:45,239 --> 01:37:46,467
He's getting away!

1276
01:37:49,510 --> 01:37:52,707
-Burke, get back here!
-Sheldon, wait!

1277
01:38:07,294 --> 01:38:08,591
Look, it's Smoochy!

1278
01:38:11,698 --> 01:38:13,461
Hey, it's Smoochy!

1279
01:38:13,634 --> 01:38:15,329
Stop him!

1280
01:38:15,502 --> 01:38:17,697
-Honey, it's Smoochy!
-Smoochy!

1281
01:39:11,825 --> 01:39:14,988
You pull a gun on me?
A gun I gave you as a gift?

1282
01:39:15,162 --> 01:39:17,357
Where's your etiquette?

1283
01:39:17,531 --> 01:39:20,523
-I'll tell you a secret about a gun.
-What?

1284
01:39:20,834 --> 01:39:22,597
You have to cock it.

1285
01:39:23,370 --> 01:39:24,632
Drop it, shithead!

1286
01:39:34,348 --> 01:39:35,906
Don't you move!

1287
01:39:36,083 --> 01:39:37,778
-You okay?
-Yeah.

1288
01:39:39,453 --> 01:39:40,477
You....

1289
01:39:40,654 --> 01:39:41,814
Take it easy.

1290
01:39:42,055 --> 01:39:45,513
You were my agent.
How could you set me up like that?

1291
01:39:45,692 --> 01:39:49,321
-It was circumstances.
-Circumstances? You killed Spinner!

1292
01:39:49,496 --> 01:39:52,897
It was a mistake.
I wish I could turn back time.

1293
01:39:53,066 --> 01:39:55,864
He was my friend, you son of a bitch!

1294
01:39:56,603 --> 01:39:59,094
Get up! Get up and look at me!

1295
01:39:59,706 --> 01:40:01,606
-You gonna shoot me?
-Yeah.

1296
01:40:01,775 --> 01:40:03,367
Not very Smoochy-like.

1297
01:40:03,543 --> 01:40:07,172
I don't feel very
Smoochy-like right now.

1298
01:40:07,347 --> 01:40:08,541
Wait.

1299
01:40:08,715 --> 01:40:12,583
Let me tell you something.
You fucked with the wrong rhino.

1300
01:40:12,753 --> 01:40:13,742
No!

1301
01:40:14,087 --> 01:40:16,749
-Sheldon, halt!
-Don't do it!

1302
01:40:18,091 --> 01:40:20,184
Tommy, stay out of this.

1303
01:40:20,460 --> 01:40:23,725
Don't destroy who you are
for this piece of shit.

1304
01:40:27,968 --> 01:40:29,526
Give me the gun.

1305
01:40:32,039 --> 01:40:34,132
My God, what am I doing?

1306
01:40:35,409 --> 01:40:37,639
Come on, now. That's it.

1307
01:40:38,378 --> 01:40:42,280
I'm sorry. I don't know how
I let myself get pushed so far.

1308
01:40:42,449 --> 01:40:46,215
You're only human, darling.
Come on. Let's go away.

1309
01:40:49,289 --> 01:40:51,883
What should we do about these guys?

1310
01:40:52,059 --> 01:40:54,391
Don't worry, we'll deal with them.

1311
01:40:54,561 --> 01:40:58,429
-You won't do anything extreme?
-Even a rat deserves mercy.

1312
01:40:58,598 --> 01:41:01,089
-Off you go.
-Thanks a lot.

1313
01:41:01,268 --> 01:41:03,600
Macanudos, my ass!

1314
01:41:04,304 --> 01:41:07,432
We're in deep shit. Deep shit.

1315
01:41:13,180 --> 01:41:16,172
You boys ever traveled
together before?

1316
01:41:28,528 --> 01:41:33,488
It's a beautiful city, but there's
a lot of grime on it, you know?

1317
01:41:33,667 --> 01:41:36,431
You helped give it
a little more polish.

1318
01:41:37,471 --> 01:41:38,802
You think?

1319
01:41:39,339 --> 01:41:40,601
Thanks.

1320
01:41:40,841 --> 01:41:43,833
Let's go home, Smooch.
The show's over.

1321
01:41:44,378 --> 01:41:47,472
No, it isn't. It's just beginning.

1322
01:42:08,735 --> 01:42:13,195
With great pleasure I introduce
to you, together for the first time...

1323
01:42:13,373 --> 01:42:17,139
...side by side, shoulder to shoulder,
ladies and gentlemen...

1324
01:42:17,310 --> 01:42:22,247
...boys and girls, please welcome
Smoochy the Rhino and Rainbow Randolph!
