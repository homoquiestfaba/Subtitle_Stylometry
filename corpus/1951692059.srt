1
00:02:01,932 --> 00:02:03,888
Scooby-Doo, where are you?

2
00:03:14,412 --> 00:03:17,210
It's Mr. Beeman, the reaI estate agent.

3
00:03:17,292 --> 00:03:18,486
Mr. Beeman?

4
00:03:18,572 --> 00:03:22,087
Yeah, he was printing miIIions
of counterfeit doIIars in the basement...

5
00:03:22,172 --> 00:03:23,844
...with his printing press.

6
00:03:23,932 --> 00:03:27,845
What we originaIIy thought was moId
was reaIIy green ink.

7
00:03:28,092 --> 00:03:29,081
See?

8
00:03:30,452 --> 00:03:32,488
I wouId've gotten away with it, too...

9
00:03:32,572 --> 00:03:35,484
...if it wasn't for that big dog
and you meddIing kids!

10
00:03:40,332 --> 00:03:43,290
And that's how we soIved
''The Case of the Moat Monster''...

11
00:03:43,372 --> 00:03:45,806
...one of our most frightening mysteries.

12
00:03:49,012 --> 00:03:52,163
Stories Iike that aIways give me
the heebie-jeebies.

13
00:03:53,292 --> 00:03:55,283
No wonder you became a reporter.

14
00:03:55,372 --> 00:03:58,887
That Moat Monster aImost sIiced you up
Iike a pepperoni pizza.

15
00:03:59,052 --> 00:04:02,328
And then we wouIdn't have
Coast to Coast with Daphne Blake...

16
00:04:02,412 --> 00:04:05,688
...your very successfuI syndicated series
on Americana.

17
00:04:05,892 --> 00:04:09,931
Going on its second season, I might add.
I never miss it.

18
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:13,921
Thanks, Chris. You know, the reaI reason
I changed jobs was because...

19
00:04:14,012 --> 00:04:17,766
...the monsters and ghosts aIways
turned out to be bad guys in a mask.

20
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:19,611
Got a IittIe boring?

21
00:04:20,612 --> 00:04:24,491
No kidding. In fact, that's why the gang
went their separate ways...

22
00:04:24,572 --> 00:04:26,164
...except for Fred and me.

23
00:04:26,252 --> 00:04:30,086
She means Fred Jones, who's now
the producer and one-man crew...

24
00:04:30,172 --> 00:04:31,605
...of Daphne's show.

25
00:04:31,692 --> 00:04:33,922
How about getting a shot of Freddy, guys?

26
00:04:36,892 --> 00:04:38,962
Is he cute or what?

27
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:41,487
So what's coming up for the new season?

28
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:44,962
A new series of segments caIIed
Haunted America.

29
00:04:45,172 --> 00:04:47,686
Sort of a
Ghost to Ghost with Daphne Blake?

30
00:04:48,772 --> 00:04:52,890
Right, but this time I intend
to find some reaI haunted houses...

31
00:04:52,972 --> 00:04:54,246
...for my viewers.

32
00:04:54,332 --> 00:04:57,847
It's too bad the rest of the oId gang
won't be aIong for the ride.

33
00:04:57,932 --> 00:05:00,400
Yeah, I reaIIy miss them.

34
00:05:04,252 --> 00:05:07,244
Yeah, we reaIIy miss you, too, Daphne.

35
00:05:07,372 --> 00:05:08,282
Yeah!

36
00:05:10,012 --> 00:05:13,004
Don't go away,
we'll be right back with Daphne Blake.

37
00:05:13,092 --> 00:05:15,526
Hey, you two! Get back to work!

38
00:05:15,772 --> 00:05:17,922
We're right on it, Boss-man, sir!

39
00:05:28,052 --> 00:05:29,565
Got something, Scoob?

40
00:05:38,732 --> 00:05:42,566
No offense, oId buddy, but I think
your nose might be Iosing its touch.

41
00:05:46,172 --> 00:05:49,562
Pretty sneaky,
but they can't fooI your nose.

42
00:05:49,772 --> 00:05:50,966
That's right!

43
00:05:51,052 --> 00:05:54,840
No one brings contraband food
into our country with us on the job!

44
00:05:55,652 --> 00:05:57,483
Let's go check it in, Scoob!

45
00:06:01,852 --> 00:06:04,650
Is this the jackpot of jobs or what?

46
00:06:10,892 --> 00:06:13,406
Yes, we do carry the Hair Raisers series.

47
00:06:14,852 --> 00:06:17,525
Number 23, The Vampire Village? Got it.

48
00:06:17,732 --> 00:06:20,644
Number 24,
The Creepy Clown Town? Got it.

49
00:06:20,892 --> 00:06:23,770
Number 25,
Menace At Mummy Manor? Got it.

50
00:06:25,132 --> 00:06:27,168
Yes, I'II hoId them tiII Tuesday.

51
00:06:27,932 --> 00:06:30,321
Two weeks from Tuesday?
Yeah, that's fine.

52
00:06:30,652 --> 00:06:31,607
'Bye.

53
00:06:38,772 --> 00:06:41,809
SoIving mysteries was a Iot more fun
than seIIing them.

54
00:06:43,572 --> 00:06:45,130
Mystery Ink Bookshop.

55
00:06:46,092 --> 00:06:47,241
Freddy?

56
00:06:47,652 --> 00:06:50,689
Jinkies! Sounds great. Count me in.

57
00:06:59,412 --> 00:07:00,731
Hi, Boss.

58
00:07:00,932 --> 00:07:03,492
You ate aII the contraband!

59
00:07:04,492 --> 00:07:05,766
Excuse me!

60
00:07:06,892 --> 00:07:09,406
Untrue, Boss. We didn't eat it aII.

61
00:07:09,492 --> 00:07:12,643
There's stiII a coupIe of GorgonzoIas Ieft!
HeIp yourseIf!

62
00:07:12,972 --> 00:07:15,850
You're a coupIe of GorgonzoIas.
You're fired!

63
00:07:19,212 --> 00:07:22,648
What a grouch!
Looks Iike we're unempIoyed again, oId paI.

64
00:07:22,972 --> 00:07:25,042
Yeah! UnempIoyed!

65
00:07:27,532 --> 00:07:30,365
Take it easy, buddy.
Something wiII turn up.

66
00:07:30,732 --> 00:07:33,326
So what if this was the greatest gig ever!

67
00:07:34,572 --> 00:07:37,769
So what if we starve.
Turn to skin and bones.

68
00:07:45,012 --> 00:07:49,324
HeIIo. Freddy?
We just caught you on the tube!

69
00:07:49,852 --> 00:07:53,845
Busy? Nah. Scoob and I were
just thinking of taking some time off!

70
00:07:54,012 --> 00:07:55,491
Yeah! Yeah!

71
00:08:03,892 --> 00:08:06,770
Sorry I'm Iate, Daph.
The traffic was murder.

72
00:08:08,012 --> 00:08:09,525
Is this everything?

73
00:08:10,452 --> 00:08:12,090
-Got the maps?
-Yeah.

74
00:08:12,212 --> 00:08:15,010
Are you sure
you haven't forgotten anything!

75
00:08:15,332 --> 00:08:17,368
Fred, what is with you?

76
00:08:17,532 --> 00:08:19,488
Yes, I'm sure I'm sure.

77
00:08:19,572 --> 00:08:20,766
WeII, then....

78
00:08:20,852 --> 00:08:24,083
Surprise! Happy Birthday, Daphne!

79
00:08:28,212 --> 00:08:31,807
Gosh, it's great to see you aII!
I've been working so hard...

80
00:08:31,892 --> 00:08:34,042
...I guess I forgot my own birthday!

81
00:08:34,132 --> 00:08:37,283
I hope you don't mind....
I asked the gang to come aIong.

82
00:08:38,372 --> 00:08:40,602
This is the best birthday present ever.

83
00:08:40,692 --> 00:08:42,444
It'II be just Iike oId times.

84
00:08:42,532 --> 00:08:44,682
Yeah! OId times!

85
00:08:47,452 --> 00:08:50,012
Easy, boy. It's great to see you, too.

86
00:08:50,492 --> 00:08:53,529
Speaking of oId times,
Iook what I have for you, Scooby.

87
00:08:53,852 --> 00:08:55,001
Scooby Snax!

88
00:08:55,372 --> 00:08:57,567
Oh, boy!

89
00:08:58,052 --> 00:09:00,646
Oh, boy!

90
00:09:00,812 --> 00:09:02,404
Go Iong, guys!

91
00:09:08,652 --> 00:09:11,883
I've been saving these Scooby Snax
for a Iong time.

92
00:09:16,772 --> 00:09:18,967
Too Iong, VeIma! They're staIe.

93
00:09:19,052 --> 00:09:22,442
Don't worry, guys. We're going
to New OrIeans for our first segment:

94
00:09:22,532 --> 00:09:23,760
Haunts of Louisiana.

95
00:09:23,852 --> 00:09:26,844
New OrIeans has
some of the best food in the worId.

96
00:09:27,932 --> 00:09:29,411
And the best ghosts.

97
00:09:29,572 --> 00:09:32,291
I hope. WeII, Iet's get going.

98
00:09:32,532 --> 00:09:34,727
HoId it. There's just one more thing.

99
00:09:36,332 --> 00:09:37,287
Groovy!

100
00:09:37,532 --> 00:09:40,330
Perfect! Mystery Inc. is back in business.

101
00:11:24,812 --> 00:11:27,406
Bad guys in masks, mechanicaI cIaws...

102
00:11:27,532 --> 00:11:29,921
...magnets, hoIogram projectors.

103
00:11:30,092 --> 00:11:31,923
Just Iike the good oId days.

104
00:11:32,052 --> 00:11:34,122
Too much Iike the good oId days.

105
00:11:34,372 --> 00:11:36,124
I've got a show to do.

106
00:11:36,212 --> 00:11:38,567
I need a reaI Iive ghost.

107
00:11:38,892 --> 00:11:40,120
That's an oxymoron.

108
00:11:40,212 --> 00:11:41,930
Doesn't anybody want a beignet?

109
00:11:42,012 --> 00:11:44,731
What I want is a house
that's reaIIy haunted.

110
00:11:45,132 --> 00:11:47,851
I mean there must be one
somewhere in Louisiana.

111
00:11:47,932 --> 00:11:49,524
There is. l work in it.

112
00:11:49,972 --> 00:11:52,088
Sorry, I couIdn't heIp but overhear.

113
00:11:52,172 --> 00:11:54,686
I work as a chef in a house
on Moonscar IsIand...

114
00:11:54,772 --> 00:11:56,490
...a house that reaIIy is haunted.

115
00:11:56,572 --> 00:11:57,368
Jinkies!

116
00:11:57,452 --> 00:11:59,488
My name is Lena. Lena Dupree.

117
00:11:59,652 --> 00:12:02,564
Fred Jones. This is VeIma DinkIey
and Daphne BIake.

118
00:12:02,772 --> 00:12:03,727
Charmed.

119
00:12:03,852 --> 00:12:06,127
Moonscar IsIand? Where is that?

120
00:12:06,572 --> 00:12:08,642
It's in a bayou not far from here.

121
00:12:09,092 --> 00:12:11,845
A pirate named Morgan Moonscar
died on the isIand.

122
00:12:11,932 --> 00:12:14,207
And his spirit stiII haunts the pIace.

123
00:12:15,132 --> 00:12:18,647
No offense, Lena, but it's probabIy
just some guy in an oId pirate suit...

124
00:12:18,732 --> 00:12:20,882
...trying to scare off the IocaI kids.

125
00:12:20,972 --> 00:12:24,567
The ghost is reaI.
Of course, if you're too scared to go--

126
00:12:24,732 --> 00:12:27,849
Scared? Me? No, I don't think so.

127
00:12:27,972 --> 00:12:30,770
If you want to check it out,
you're weIcome to come by.

128
00:12:30,852 --> 00:12:34,288
-I'II Ieave when I finish shopping.
-We'II think about it.

129
00:12:34,572 --> 00:12:35,971
What do you think?

130
00:12:36,052 --> 00:12:39,408
What do we have to Iose?
It's the best Iead we've had aII day.

131
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:41,483
And that Lena is kind of cute.

132
00:12:42,492 --> 00:12:45,484
I just meant she'd be reaI photogenic
for our segment.

133
00:12:45,972 --> 00:12:47,166
Right.

134
00:12:47,612 --> 00:12:49,967
Wipe your upper Iip, Romeo.

135
00:12:50,052 --> 00:12:51,690
Jinkies! Listen to this.

136
00:12:51,972 --> 00:12:54,884
I punched up Moonscar IsIand
on our research database.

137
00:12:55,292 --> 00:12:59,683
There have been strange disappearances
around that isIand over the years.

138
00:13:00,532 --> 00:13:02,011
Sounds promising.

139
00:13:02,092 --> 00:13:05,209
We'd better find Scooby and Shaggy
before Lena takes off.

140
00:13:05,292 --> 00:13:07,760
-Where'd those guys go?
-That's no mystery.

141
00:13:07,852 --> 00:13:09,888
Where eIse? To get a bite to eat!

142
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:15,726
I've made a Iot of poor boy sandwiches
in my time.

143
00:13:15,812 --> 00:13:18,167
But this has got to be the biggest
of them aII!

144
00:13:18,252 --> 00:13:20,368
We're used to eating big meaIs!

145
00:13:21,252 --> 00:13:24,403
Buddy, don't hog aII the hot sauce.

146
00:13:24,492 --> 00:13:26,210
I see you boys Iike it hot.

147
00:13:26,292 --> 00:13:28,442
Mo' hotter, mo' better.

148
00:13:28,652 --> 00:13:31,041
Mo' hotter, mo' better!

149
00:13:38,252 --> 00:13:41,449
That was a Iot Iess fiIIing
than I thought it wouId be.

150
00:13:42,252 --> 00:13:45,608
Let's go, guys. We've found
another haunted house to investigate.

151
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:56,163
Good timing, guys.
Lena was just about to Ieave without us.

152
00:14:25,652 --> 00:14:27,244
We're getting cIoser.

153
00:14:27,332 --> 00:14:30,483
Moonscar IsIand is right in the middIe
of the next bayou.

154
00:14:30,692 --> 00:14:34,048
Sounds Iike a perfect pIace
to get some good, spooky footage.

155
00:14:34,412 --> 00:14:36,323
And some good Cajun cooking!

156
00:14:36,732 --> 00:14:38,768
For some reason, I'm stiII starved.

157
00:14:40,772 --> 00:14:43,969
Even these staIe Scooby Snax
are beginning to taste good.

158
00:15:01,652 --> 00:15:05,042
Ms. Lena, I see you've brought you
some company.

159
00:15:05,172 --> 00:15:09,643
Yes, Jacques. These foIks came
a Iong way to see a reaI haunted house.

160
00:15:11,212 --> 00:15:14,284
If they want haunted,
they've come to the right pIace.

161
00:15:14,812 --> 00:15:18,771
PeopIes go into that bayou,
and they don't never come out.

162
00:15:20,012 --> 00:15:21,604
So we understand.

163
00:15:32,212 --> 00:15:33,611
Ladies first.

164
00:15:43,892 --> 00:15:46,486
Do you seII food on this ferry?
We're starved!

165
00:15:47,492 --> 00:15:50,086
I didn't know you had a dog.

166
00:15:50,252 --> 00:15:51,571
Dog? Where?

167
00:15:51,972 --> 00:15:53,610
Are you aIIergic to dogs?

168
00:15:53,932 --> 00:15:57,607
No, it's just that my empIoyer,
Ms. Lenoir...

169
00:15:57,892 --> 00:15:59,291
...she keeps cats.

170
00:15:59,412 --> 00:16:02,643
Don't worry.
Scooby is great with cats. Right?

171
00:16:04,452 --> 00:16:05,646
Yeah.

172
00:16:27,092 --> 00:16:29,925
Gosh, I'd sure hate to get Iost in here.

173
00:16:31,372 --> 00:16:35,650
Way back in the 1700s,
pirates used this bayou...

174
00:16:35,732 --> 00:16:37,370
...to hide from the Iaw.

175
00:16:37,612 --> 00:16:40,843
They knew onIy a fooI
wouId come a Iooking in here.

176
00:16:41,332 --> 00:16:44,165
And Morgan Moonscar
was one of those pirates?

177
00:16:44,412 --> 00:16:48,325
Yes, cher. He was one
of the most famous of them.

178
00:16:53,532 --> 00:16:55,204
Shaggy! Catfish!

179
00:16:55,332 --> 00:16:58,881
Zoinks!
That's the biggest catfish I've ever seen.

180
00:17:00,252 --> 00:17:02,561
That's probabIy Big Mona.

181
00:17:02,652 --> 00:17:05,530
Ain't nobody never been abIe to catch her.

182
00:17:08,052 --> 00:17:11,249
Guess that's one catfish
who doesn't Iike dogs, oId buddy.

183
00:17:12,252 --> 00:17:13,731
Rotten catfish!

184
00:17:19,132 --> 00:17:20,804
I've got you, Scoob!

185
00:17:32,052 --> 00:17:33,041
Oh, no!

186
00:17:33,132 --> 00:17:35,362
You've got to turn this thing around!

187
00:17:36,012 --> 00:17:38,890
I'm trying, son.
But she don't turn on no dime!

188
00:17:41,292 --> 00:17:42,725
Hang on, guys!

189
00:18:20,612 --> 00:18:22,330
Thanks, mister!

190
00:18:24,012 --> 00:18:26,287
ShouId have Iet the 'gators eat you.

191
00:18:26,492 --> 00:18:28,801
I can't stand tourists.

192
00:18:29,452 --> 00:18:32,250
Now aII your spIashing
chased Big Mona away!

193
00:18:32,892 --> 00:18:34,848
Quit your grumbIing, Snakebite.

194
00:18:35,132 --> 00:18:38,602
You ain't never caught that fish,
and you ain't never gonna did!

195
00:18:38,772 --> 00:18:39,841
Says you!

196
00:18:42,372 --> 00:18:44,010
Not too friendIy, is he?

197
00:18:48,292 --> 00:18:49,441
What is that?

198
00:18:49,532 --> 00:18:52,365
This here's my hunting pig, Mojo!

199
00:18:52,452 --> 00:18:53,567
Hunting pig?

200
00:18:53,972 --> 00:18:56,406
He's a Iot better than any hound dog.

201
00:18:56,732 --> 00:18:58,962
He can smeII a catfish a miIe away.

202
00:19:05,652 --> 00:19:08,007
Lot smarter than any dog, too.

203
00:19:08,372 --> 00:19:11,682
Now get these trespassing tourists
off my boat!

204
00:19:12,132 --> 00:19:13,770
I got fishing to do!

205
00:19:18,892 --> 00:19:20,803
That's oId Snakebite Scruggs.

206
00:19:21,692 --> 00:19:24,331
He think the bayou
is his own private preserve.

207
00:19:24,772 --> 00:19:26,888
He don't Iike anybody being in it, no.

208
00:19:26,972 --> 00:19:30,169
So we noticed.
Suspicious character, eh, VeIma?

209
00:19:30,412 --> 00:19:33,643
True, but he did save you
from being eaten by aIIigators.

210
00:19:33,892 --> 00:19:35,007
Oh, yeah.

211
00:19:40,772 --> 00:19:43,525
Moonscar IsIand, dead ahead.

212
00:20:02,732 --> 00:20:03,847
And Ms. Lena...

213
00:20:03,932 --> 00:20:06,730
...you give my best to Ms. Lenoir,
you hear, cher?

214
00:20:06,892 --> 00:20:08,928
I'II do that, Jacques. Thanks.

215
00:20:09,292 --> 00:20:11,681
Ready? FoIIow me and hang on.

216
00:20:11,892 --> 00:20:14,042
The road's a IittIe bumpy.

217
00:20:46,612 --> 00:20:48,284
There's our haunted house.

218
00:20:54,612 --> 00:20:57,684
-Are you getting aII of this, Fred?
-Yep. Got it, Daph.

219
00:20:58,412 --> 00:21:01,131
Lena wasn't kidding.
This place is crawling with cats.

220
00:21:01,212 --> 00:21:02,201
Cats?

221
00:21:04,932 --> 00:21:05,887
Cats!

222
00:21:07,012 --> 00:21:08,365
Come back, Scoob!

223
00:21:18,892 --> 00:21:21,201
You mutt! I just pIanted those!

224
00:21:23,772 --> 00:21:24,841
Rats!

225
00:21:25,932 --> 00:21:28,526
Scooby, Ieave them aIone!

226
00:21:34,852 --> 00:21:36,205
''Great with cats''?

227
00:21:37,652 --> 00:21:39,370
Scooby-Doo, stop!

228
00:21:40,332 --> 00:21:42,562
I spent a whoIe week on that pIanter!

229
00:21:47,652 --> 00:21:48,926
Excuse me.

230
00:21:55,692 --> 00:21:56,966
Ms. Lenoir!

231
00:21:59,852 --> 00:22:01,763
Who brought this...

232
00:22:02,212 --> 00:22:03,167
...dog?

233
00:22:03,332 --> 00:22:04,651
Dog? Where?

234
00:22:05,212 --> 00:22:08,329
I'm terribIy sorry.
We shouId have heId onto him better.

235
00:22:08,772 --> 00:22:10,888
I'm Daphne BIake of Coast To Coast.

236
00:22:12,172 --> 00:22:13,890
You know, the TV show?

237
00:22:13,972 --> 00:22:17,009
We do not have teIevision on my isIand.

238
00:22:17,612 --> 00:22:19,842
Lena, what are they doing here?

239
00:22:19,932 --> 00:22:21,843
It's aII my fauIt, Ms. Lenoir.

240
00:22:21,932 --> 00:22:25,242
I heard these foIks say
they wanted to see a reaI haunted house.

241
00:22:25,332 --> 00:22:28,324
-So I thought--
-You might show them mine.

242
00:22:28,612 --> 00:22:29,601
I see.

243
00:22:30,252 --> 00:22:31,401
ReaIIy, Lena.

244
00:22:31,492 --> 00:22:35,201
But your house is simpIy beautifuI,
Ms. Lenoir. Isn't it, Fred?

245
00:22:35,532 --> 00:22:37,762
Picture perfect. Just how oId is it?

246
00:22:38,092 --> 00:22:41,209
It has been in my famiIy for generations.

247
00:22:41,652 --> 00:22:43,608
It was a pepper pIantation.

248
00:22:43,772 --> 00:22:47,401
Some of the hottest peppers in Louisiana
grow on this isIand.

249
00:22:49,172 --> 00:22:51,766
We've hit the proverbiaI
chiIi pepper jackpot.

250
00:22:52,252 --> 00:22:55,050
So, Ms. Lenoir, is your house reaIIy--

251
00:22:55,212 --> 00:22:57,168
Haunted? Yes.

252
00:22:57,332 --> 00:23:00,210
It is an oId house with a restIess spirit.

253
00:23:03,012 --> 00:23:06,004
You're weIcome to Iook around,
if you'd Iike.

254
00:23:06,252 --> 00:23:08,891
WouId we ever! Do you mind us taping?

255
00:23:09,092 --> 00:23:11,048
No. Of course not.

256
00:23:11,372 --> 00:23:13,522
In fact, I'd be most fIattered.

257
00:23:15,532 --> 00:23:18,444
But, you'II have to do something
about your...

258
00:23:19,292 --> 00:23:20,281
...dog.

259
00:23:20,812 --> 00:23:23,451
Food aIways keeps Scooby occupied.

260
00:23:23,532 --> 00:23:28,208
If it wiII keep him from chasing my cats,
you're weIcome to my kitchen.

261
00:23:28,492 --> 00:23:30,448
Groovy! Come on, Scoob.

262
00:23:35,052 --> 00:23:36,644
Sorry about aII the damage.

263
00:23:36,732 --> 00:23:38,688
Don't worry, Beau wiII take care of it.

264
00:23:38,772 --> 00:23:40,410
-Beau?
-Our new gardener.

265
00:23:42,852 --> 00:23:45,286
Sure, I'II take care of it. Gardener!

266
00:23:49,452 --> 00:23:51,443
Cat food! Yuck!

267
00:23:51,612 --> 00:23:53,204
Forget the cat food, Scoob!

268
00:23:53,292 --> 00:23:55,760
There's a Iot better chow in this kitchen!

269
00:23:56,172 --> 00:23:58,402
SmeIIs great. It's gumbo, isn't it?

270
00:23:58,492 --> 00:24:00,005
You do know your food.

271
00:24:00,252 --> 00:24:03,927
We've traveIed the worId on our stomachs.
Mind if we have a taste?

272
00:24:04,012 --> 00:24:06,480
Of course not.
Let me know how you Iike it.

273
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:13,604
Not bad, but it needs a IittIe more spice.

274
00:24:13,692 --> 00:24:14,841
Don't you think so?

275
00:24:21,492 --> 00:24:23,642
These puppies ought to do the trick.

276
00:24:25,132 --> 00:24:26,963
DeIicious Iemonade, Lena.

277
00:24:27,052 --> 00:24:28,280
Why, thank you.

278
00:24:28,372 --> 00:24:30,408
So, how Iong have you worked for--

279
00:24:32,092 --> 00:24:33,081
The guys!

280
00:24:45,812 --> 00:24:48,280
That was some hot pepper!

281
00:24:49,052 --> 00:24:51,361
Those are Moonscar IsIand peppers!

282
00:24:51,492 --> 00:24:56,282
I wasn't exaggerating when I said
they were the hottest peppers in Louisiana.

283
00:24:56,372 --> 00:24:59,444
With aII the screaming,
we thought you might've seen a ghost.

284
00:24:59,532 --> 00:25:01,807
If we do, you'II be the first to know.

285
00:25:02,252 --> 00:25:04,402
Sorry for the interruption, Ms. Lenoir.

286
00:25:04,492 --> 00:25:06,642
PIease, caII me Simone.

287
00:25:06,892 --> 00:25:09,201
ShaII we continue our tour of the house?

288
00:25:09,292 --> 00:25:10,964
Great, Ms. Simone.

289
00:25:11,372 --> 00:25:13,932
Maybe you guys shouId stay away
from those peppers.

290
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:16,401
Right. We'II just stick with the gumbo.

291
00:25:16,572 --> 00:25:18,563
-If you don't mind, Lena.
-Of course not.

292
00:25:18,772 --> 00:25:20,728
I'm gIad you Iike it. HeIp yourseIves.

293
00:25:25,212 --> 00:25:26,804
Come on. I dare you.

294
00:25:27,732 --> 00:25:28,847
You first.

295
00:25:28,932 --> 00:25:31,400
Not chicken are you, oId buddy oId paI?

296
00:25:34,412 --> 00:25:35,811
That's funny.

297
00:25:35,892 --> 00:25:39,202
A second ago I was on fire.
And now it's freezing!

298
00:25:40,412 --> 00:25:42,403
Yeah, freezing.

299
00:25:42,732 --> 00:25:46,407
TeII you what. We'II spIit the big one.
That'II warm us up.

300
00:25:52,652 --> 00:25:54,961
Now this is a great Iibrary, Simone--

301
00:25:57,052 --> 00:25:58,326
Now what?

302
00:26:05,012 --> 00:26:06,411
Peppers? Again?

303
00:26:07,692 --> 00:26:10,604
-Writing!
-Writing? What writing?

304
00:26:10,892 --> 00:26:12,325
Ghost writing!

305
00:26:13,052 --> 00:26:15,486
See? This pIace is haunted.

306
00:26:15,732 --> 00:26:17,848
Wow! Fred, get a shot of that!

307
00:26:18,052 --> 00:26:19,201
Jinkies!

308
00:26:19,692 --> 00:26:22,081
Simone, couId you come stand
next to me, pIease?

309
00:26:27,532 --> 00:26:30,444
Here we are
in Ms. Simone Lenoir's kitchen...

310
00:26:30,652 --> 00:26:35,362
...where we've had our first encounter with
supernatural spirits ofMoonscar mansion.

311
00:26:35,852 --> 00:26:38,082
You can feel the chill in the air.

312
00:26:39,932 --> 00:26:42,571
Cut! Who opened a window?

313
00:26:42,732 --> 00:26:44,450
Nobody! Look!

314
00:26:44,612 --> 00:26:45,727
Beware!

315
00:26:45,812 --> 00:26:48,485
Wow! Is this great stuff or what?

316
00:26:49,372 --> 00:26:51,169
Right! Great!

317
00:26:51,532 --> 00:26:53,762
The haunting might just be starting.

318
00:26:53,852 --> 00:26:56,571
After sundown,
the ghosts get more restIess.

319
00:26:58,332 --> 00:26:59,970
This seems pretty soIid.

320
00:27:00,052 --> 00:27:03,931
Keep roIIing, Fred. Maybe we'II have
another ghostIy manifestation.

321
00:27:04,692 --> 00:27:07,570
-Freddy! I'm over here!
-It's VeIma!

322
00:27:10,252 --> 00:27:13,210
We've been Ievitated before,
and there's aIways a magnet...

323
00:27:13,292 --> 00:27:14,725
...or wires somewhere.

324
00:27:14,812 --> 00:27:16,245
No wires here, Fred.

325
00:27:17,332 --> 00:27:19,607
A reaI case of Ievitation!

326
00:27:20,932 --> 00:27:22,968
This just gets better and better.

327
00:27:23,412 --> 00:27:25,482
Maybe from where you're standing.

328
00:27:25,652 --> 00:27:27,847
Anybody want to try getting me down?

329
00:27:27,932 --> 00:27:29,763
Sure thing. Come on, Scoob.

330
00:27:32,532 --> 00:27:34,648
Nice catch, Scooby. Thanks.

331
00:27:34,852 --> 00:27:36,331
You're weIcome!

332
00:27:37,292 --> 00:27:39,681
You can feel the chill in the air.

333
00:27:41,132 --> 00:27:43,521
Cut! Who opened a window?

334
00:27:44,492 --> 00:27:47,529
PIay it again, Fred.
I think I saw something.

335
00:27:47,692 --> 00:27:48,807
Sure.

336
00:27:48,972 --> 00:27:50,644
Who opened a window?

337
00:27:50,732 --> 00:27:53,041
There! CouId you enhance this shot?

338
00:27:53,452 --> 00:27:54,407
Yeah.

339
00:27:54,492 --> 00:27:58,610
Let me darken the image a IittIe.
Bring up the sharpness a bit and....

340
00:28:01,212 --> 00:28:03,521
It Iooks Iike a ghost!

341
00:28:04,132 --> 00:28:06,248
It's the ghost of Morgan Moonscar.

342
00:28:06,772 --> 00:28:09,081
Here, Iet me show you.

343
00:28:10,612 --> 00:28:12,842
This is a portrait of Morgan McReight.

344
00:28:13,212 --> 00:28:17,125
The moon-shaped scar is why he became
better known as Morgan Moonscar.

345
00:28:17,372 --> 00:28:20,330
That's him aII right, and he wants us out.

346
00:28:20,412 --> 00:28:22,323
We'd be happy to get out!

347
00:28:22,412 --> 00:28:25,085
A reaI pirate ghost. FabuIous!

348
00:28:25,332 --> 00:28:29,450
I can't thank you enough for opening
your haunted house to us, Simone.

349
00:28:29,532 --> 00:28:32,968
So, you're not going to heed
Moonscar's threat?

350
00:28:33,212 --> 00:28:34,531
Are you kidding?

351
00:28:34,732 --> 00:28:36,484
We don't scare that easiIy.

352
00:28:36,772 --> 00:28:38,091
We do!

353
00:28:38,412 --> 00:28:41,688
Besides, it's probabIy just a hoIogram
of a guy in a pirate suit.

354
00:28:41,772 --> 00:28:44,127
Then why did it onIy show up on the tape?

355
00:28:44,212 --> 00:28:45,531
That's the mystery.

356
00:28:45,612 --> 00:28:48,809
But there's aIways a IogicaI expIanation
for these things.

357
00:28:50,052 --> 00:28:51,087
What's that?

358
00:28:51,172 --> 00:28:54,323
There's a IogicaI expIanation
for the growIing in our stomachs!

359
00:28:54,412 --> 00:28:57,290
We're hungry!
And we're going to get some food to go!

360
00:29:15,332 --> 00:29:17,527
What are you doing back here?

361
00:29:17,612 --> 00:29:20,001
I want to take another Iook at the waII.

362
00:29:20,092 --> 00:29:23,050
What's to Iook at?
It's pretty cIear that ghost wants us out!

363
00:29:23,132 --> 00:29:24,850
Come on, Scoob. Let's go.

364
00:29:25,132 --> 00:29:27,202
It isn't hoIIow, but maybe....

365
00:29:28,532 --> 00:29:30,409
There's something under here.

366
00:29:37,132 --> 00:29:38,611
M-A....

367
00:29:40,692 --> 00:29:43,001
What are you doing to my kitchen?

368
00:29:43,172 --> 00:29:45,606
Jinkies! Guess I got carried away!

369
00:29:48,332 --> 00:29:49,367
Bingo!

370
00:29:49,452 --> 00:29:52,842
WouId you mind teIIing me
why you destroyed haIf my kitchen?

371
00:29:52,932 --> 00:29:55,048
Yeah, VeIma. Let us in on it?

372
00:29:55,212 --> 00:29:57,362
WeII, according to this book...

373
00:29:57,452 --> 00:30:00,728
...the MaeIstrom was the name
of Morgan Moonscar's pirate ship.

374
00:30:00,812 --> 00:30:02,245
I am not surprised.

375
00:30:02,412 --> 00:30:04,448
Parts of this house are quite oId.

376
00:30:04,812 --> 00:30:08,088
Pieces of the pirate ship
couId have been used in the construction.

377
00:30:08,492 --> 00:30:12,451
Morgan Moonscar was rumored
to have buried treasure on the island.

378
00:30:12,652 --> 00:30:14,722
Though it was never found.

379
00:30:14,932 --> 00:30:16,047
Treasure?

380
00:30:16,772 --> 00:30:17,727
I knew it!

381
00:30:17,812 --> 00:30:22,044
It's some guy disguised as a pirate ghost
trying to scare everyone off the isIand!

382
00:30:33,572 --> 00:30:35,483
Your turn, paI.

383
00:30:48,652 --> 00:30:51,212
Don't use my sandwich to wash it down.

384
00:30:51,532 --> 00:30:53,762
Eat some of that CreoIe potato saIad.

385
00:31:00,612 --> 00:31:01,647
Cats!

386
00:31:10,412 --> 00:31:14,166
Come back! That grouchy gardener
isn't going to be happy about this.

387
00:31:52,332 --> 00:31:53,685
Come back, Scoob!

388
00:31:54,252 --> 00:31:58,006
Man! I can't pass up a hot opportunity
Iike this.

389
00:32:09,812 --> 00:32:12,804
-You scared away Big Mona!
-Sorry.

390
00:32:13,052 --> 00:32:15,691
Darn tourist! Get them, Mojo!

391
00:32:25,292 --> 00:32:27,044
What's the matter, Scoob?

392
00:32:27,132 --> 00:32:29,202
Not afraid of a few cats, are you?

393
00:32:30,412 --> 00:32:32,482
-Rojo!
-Rojo?

394
00:32:34,252 --> 00:32:36,322
You mean Mojo!

395
00:32:49,292 --> 00:32:53,046
How humiIiating!
Chased into a hoIe by one-third of a BLT.

396
00:33:01,212 --> 00:33:04,045
Hang on. I'II have us out in a sec.

397
00:33:04,492 --> 00:33:05,925
I hope so.

398
00:33:31,572 --> 00:33:34,211
-What's going on?
-I don't know!

399
00:34:34,412 --> 00:34:36,528
Are we gIad to see you!

400
00:34:36,652 --> 00:34:39,883
What are you doing out here?
Ruining more of my fIower beds?

401
00:34:39,972 --> 00:34:43,851
If you want to pIant something,
there's a dead guy foIIowing us!

402
00:34:43,932 --> 00:34:45,729
Yeah! Dead guy!

403
00:34:48,332 --> 00:34:50,163
Where? I don't see anything.

404
00:34:53,252 --> 00:34:54,765
What's going on, guys?

405
00:34:54,852 --> 00:34:57,810
We couId hear you screaming
aII the way to the house.

406
00:34:58,252 --> 00:35:01,050
It's you guys. It was horribIe.

407
00:35:01,132 --> 00:35:04,522
That pirate Moonscar was nothing
but bones...

408
00:35:04,772 --> 00:35:06,444
...and then, he got worse.

409
00:35:06,532 --> 00:35:07,965
Like a zombie!

410
00:35:08,132 --> 00:35:09,121
Oh, dear!

411
00:35:09,212 --> 00:35:10,645
Where did aII this happen?

412
00:35:13,412 --> 00:35:16,643
There's nothing here now.
Are you sure you saw a zombie?

413
00:35:16,812 --> 00:35:19,280
We know a zombie when we see one.

414
00:35:19,372 --> 00:35:20,964
Yeah! Zombie!

415
00:35:21,172 --> 00:35:22,890
And then we ran into him.

416
00:35:25,732 --> 00:35:27,609
What were you doing out here?

417
00:35:29,212 --> 00:35:30,531
My job.

418
00:35:30,652 --> 00:35:34,008
I was doing some pIanting,
got thirsty, went to get a drink...

419
00:35:34,092 --> 00:35:36,731
...and came back to find these two.

420
00:35:39,012 --> 00:35:42,163
What are you pIanting, eIephants?
That hoIe is huge!

421
00:35:48,412 --> 00:35:51,131
There's something suspicious
about that gardener.

422
00:35:51,212 --> 00:35:53,168
Yeah, he is suspicious...

423
00:35:53,532 --> 00:35:55,250
...but he is kind of cute.

424
00:35:56,052 --> 00:35:58,885
If we're aII through here,
maybe we shouId get going.

425
00:35:58,972 --> 00:36:01,088
That's a great idea.

426
00:36:01,612 --> 00:36:03,523
Get going? No way.

427
00:36:03,772 --> 00:36:06,411
This pIace gets more interesting
by the minute.

428
00:36:06,572 --> 00:36:08,961
But it is getting cIose to sunset.

429
00:36:09,132 --> 00:36:11,362
And the ferry doesn't run at night.

430
00:36:11,612 --> 00:36:12,931
We do.

431
00:36:13,452 --> 00:36:17,081
We have pIenty of rooms.
You couId stay for the night.

432
00:36:17,492 --> 00:36:18,447
ReaIIy?

433
00:36:19,132 --> 00:36:24,081
I couIdn't Iet you Ieave without offering
some of our famous southern hospitaIity.

434
00:36:24,452 --> 00:36:27,603
That is,
if Lena doesn't mind some extra guests.

435
00:36:28,532 --> 00:36:31,092
Sure thing, Ms. Lenoir. I'II start dinner.

436
00:36:31,892 --> 00:36:32,961
Dinner?

437
00:36:33,052 --> 00:36:35,043
Why didn't you say so?

438
00:36:42,972 --> 00:36:46,408
And this is your room.
I hope you'II both be comfortabIe.

439
00:36:46,492 --> 00:36:48,847
Thanks, Lena. What time's dinner?

440
00:36:49,612 --> 00:36:52,490
I have never met a pair who ate so much.

441
00:36:52,612 --> 00:36:56,764
Being in a state of constant terror
makes us constantIy hungry.

442
00:36:56,972 --> 00:36:58,803
Yeah, constantIy!

443
00:36:59,532 --> 00:37:01,523
Your room is this way, Fred.

444
00:37:07,332 --> 00:37:10,563
You'II have a beautifuI view
of the harvest moon tonight.

445
00:37:10,972 --> 00:37:13,167
I hope you'II be comfortabIe here.

446
00:37:14,532 --> 00:37:16,250
Thanks, Lena. I'm sure I wiII.

447
00:37:16,332 --> 00:37:18,402
And this is your room, Ms. BIake.

448
00:37:23,532 --> 00:37:24,760
Thanks, Ms....

449
00:37:34,172 --> 00:37:36,970
Maybe I shouId dress
for dinner, eh, Scoob?

450
00:37:38,612 --> 00:37:40,330
Me! That's who!

451
00:37:58,972 --> 00:38:01,088
Quit bothering the wiIdIife, buddy.

452
00:38:02,572 --> 00:38:03,971
How do I Iook?

453
00:38:04,452 --> 00:38:06,682
Am I gonna turn a few heads or what?

454
00:38:08,612 --> 00:38:09,681
Or what!

455
00:38:10,012 --> 00:38:11,650
Boy, do I need a trim.

456
00:38:15,092 --> 00:38:16,445
Much better.

457
00:38:19,492 --> 00:38:20,845
Get away.

458
00:38:22,572 --> 00:38:25,484
-Who's that?
-I don't know.

459
00:38:25,612 --> 00:38:26,806
Get away!

460
00:38:41,612 --> 00:38:43,523
Get this beast off of me!

461
00:38:44,332 --> 00:38:45,845
We're terribIy sorry.

462
00:38:47,612 --> 00:38:48,727
Sorry.

463
00:38:50,052 --> 00:38:51,531
That's quite enough.

464
00:38:52,572 --> 00:38:54,483
What on earth are you doing?

465
00:38:55,252 --> 00:38:57,607
-Scooby and Shaggy--
-Saw another ghost.

466
00:39:02,012 --> 00:39:02,967
In here!

467
00:39:05,372 --> 00:39:06,885
I don't see anything.

468
00:39:07,892 --> 00:39:10,850
In the mirror! It's some CiviI War guy.

469
00:39:10,972 --> 00:39:13,361
There's nothing in the mirror now, guys.

470
00:39:13,812 --> 00:39:16,280
There's nothing behind the mirror, either.

471
00:39:17,132 --> 00:39:18,326
Wait a minute.

472
00:39:21,012 --> 00:39:23,048
There's something under this dust.

473
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:29,806
Excuse me!

474
00:39:30,252 --> 00:39:32,004
That's okay, Scooby!

475
00:39:32,332 --> 00:39:34,800
Must have Iost my eyegIass cIeaning cIoth.

476
00:39:41,292 --> 00:39:42,611
Thanks, Scooby.

477
00:39:43,772 --> 00:39:44,807
Hey, Iook!

478
00:39:44,892 --> 00:39:49,170
''Property of CoIoneI Jackson T. Pettigrew,
8th Louisiana.''

479
00:39:50,812 --> 00:39:53,087
That sounds Iike a CiviI War regiment.

480
00:39:53,172 --> 00:39:55,766
There were Confederate barracks
on this isIand.

481
00:39:56,852 --> 00:39:59,161
Maybe you guys saw something after aII.

482
00:39:59,372 --> 00:40:02,842
Ghost pirates, ghost soIdiers, what's next?

483
00:40:03,172 --> 00:40:04,161
Dinner.

484
00:40:04,412 --> 00:40:08,007
From aII the screaming up here,
I'd say you two must be starving.

485
00:40:15,412 --> 00:40:17,926
Your dining room is beautifuI, Simone.

486
00:40:18,092 --> 00:40:19,491
Thank you, Daphne.

487
00:40:19,572 --> 00:40:23,201
But I'm afraid your dog
wiII have to eat in the kitchen.

488
00:40:23,372 --> 00:40:25,010
Dog? Where?

489
00:40:25,132 --> 00:40:28,522
Come on, oId buddy.
We'II chow down in the kitchen.

490
00:40:29,652 --> 00:40:31,290
This gumbo is deIicious.

491
00:40:31,452 --> 00:40:33,761
And these biscuits, Iight as a feather.

492
00:40:36,812 --> 00:40:37,847
Where's Beau?

493
00:40:37,932 --> 00:40:41,641
He usuaIIy has dinner in his rooms
above the carriage house.

494
00:40:41,972 --> 00:40:44,645
I brought him some food,
but he wasn't there.

495
00:40:44,812 --> 00:40:45,767
Figures.

496
00:40:48,852 --> 00:40:49,841
Cats!

497
00:40:57,292 --> 00:41:00,887
ExactIy how Iong has Beau been working
for you, Ms. Lenoir?

498
00:41:01,572 --> 00:41:04,644
SeveraI months, and it's Simone, VeIma.

499
00:41:05,172 --> 00:41:07,606
I think this guy is pretty suspicious.

500
00:41:08,012 --> 00:41:10,048
He had exceIIent references.

501
00:41:11,172 --> 00:41:13,925
I don't think the kitchen
was such a good idea.

502
00:41:14,092 --> 00:41:15,366
You know, cats!

503
00:41:15,532 --> 00:41:16,601
Cats!

504
00:41:19,932 --> 00:41:21,445
This is quite enough!

505
00:41:22,692 --> 00:41:25,286
The dog wiII have to eat outside!

506
00:41:25,572 --> 00:41:26,561
Outside?

507
00:41:28,252 --> 00:41:30,402
There's a dead guy out there!

508
00:41:30,932 --> 00:41:32,604
May I make a suggestion?

509
00:41:37,132 --> 00:41:39,168
This is a Iot quieter, buddy.

510
00:41:39,252 --> 00:41:41,846
And Lena even made us
a speciaI dish to go.

511
00:41:46,412 --> 00:41:49,290
Nothing Iike
a good oId-fashioned crawfish boiI!

512
00:41:50,932 --> 00:41:51,921
Crawfish!

513
00:41:59,852 --> 00:42:02,002
These crawfish sure are tasty.

514
00:42:06,252 --> 00:42:08,322
Not much meat on this crawdad!

515
00:42:17,932 --> 00:42:20,127
-Here, buddy, have a biscuit.
-Thanks!

516
00:42:24,012 --> 00:42:27,049
Something teIIs me
you're getting the best of this meaI.

517
00:42:28,612 --> 00:42:29,567
Cats!

518
00:42:32,452 --> 00:42:36,001
It's hard to enjoy a meaI
with a bunch of eyes staring at you!

519
00:42:38,012 --> 00:42:39,968
Sit tight, oId buddy.

520
00:42:42,212 --> 00:42:44,362
I'II find us a peacefuI pIace to eat.

521
00:42:53,012 --> 00:42:57,051
What I'd Iike to find out
is why these ghosts want us off the isIand?

522
00:42:57,452 --> 00:43:00,683
It's not ghosts, VeIma,
it's just guys in masks.

523
00:43:00,772 --> 00:43:03,240
They're probabIy after the pirates' treasure.

524
00:43:03,332 --> 00:43:05,800
Or covering up a smuggIing operation.

525
00:43:06,212 --> 00:43:08,521
Or maybe there's oiI under the isIand.

526
00:43:08,972 --> 00:43:10,087
Oh, my!

527
00:43:10,412 --> 00:43:11,765
ReaIIy, guys!

528
00:43:11,852 --> 00:43:14,082
For once, can't you accept that maybe...

529
00:43:14,172 --> 00:43:17,767
...there are some mysteries
that have no rationaI expIanation.

530
00:43:23,452 --> 00:43:25,283
This is much better.

531
00:43:29,852 --> 00:43:32,412
And now for the heat de resistance!

532
00:43:35,252 --> 00:43:38,164
On your mark, get set, ignition!

533
00:43:46,932 --> 00:43:50,004
No fair! What's the matter? Chicken?

534
00:44:28,892 --> 00:44:29,847
Zombies!

535
00:44:49,052 --> 00:44:50,644
Come on! Come on!

536
00:44:59,732 --> 00:45:01,848
I think we ditched them, buddy!

537
00:45:12,212 --> 00:45:13,201
Zoinks!

538
00:45:35,052 --> 00:45:36,041
Zoinks!

539
00:45:47,692 --> 00:45:50,160
We shouId do a segment
on Lena's pecan pie.

540
00:45:50,652 --> 00:45:53,769
-It's supernaturaI!
-You are so corny!

541
00:45:55,372 --> 00:45:56,566
Now what?

542
00:45:57,972 --> 00:46:00,532
I toId you,
the hauntings were just beginning.

543
00:46:00,612 --> 00:46:02,489
If you Iadies wiII excuse me.

544
00:46:05,052 --> 00:46:06,883
Lena, get them some Ianterns.

545
00:46:07,212 --> 00:46:11,330
Right away.
But pIease, Fred, you must be carefuI.

546
00:46:23,732 --> 00:46:24,926
Where are you?

547
00:46:27,212 --> 00:46:28,088
Guys?

548
00:46:29,412 --> 00:46:30,811
So, it's you!

549
00:46:32,372 --> 00:46:34,169
Where are Scooby and Shaggy?

550
00:46:34,252 --> 00:46:37,927
Your crazy friends are near the bayou
screaming about zombies.

551
00:46:38,252 --> 00:46:39,571
I didn't see any.

552
00:46:39,652 --> 00:46:41,005
You never do!

553
00:46:41,092 --> 00:46:44,562
And you're never around
when these ghosts and zombies appear.

554
00:46:44,652 --> 00:46:47,041
Yeah. Now isn't that a coincidence?

555
00:46:47,692 --> 00:46:49,762
Save your suspicions for Iater, guys.

556
00:46:49,852 --> 00:46:52,571
Right now we have to find
Scooby and Shaggy.

557
00:46:52,852 --> 00:46:55,207
-I think we shouId spIit up.
-Good idea.

558
00:46:55,292 --> 00:46:57,487
-I'II go with Beau.
-Bad idea!

559
00:46:57,572 --> 00:47:00,325
I'II go with Beau.
I won't Iet him out of my sight.

560
00:47:11,692 --> 00:47:14,729
Why do you keep treating me
Iike I'm a suspect?

561
00:47:14,812 --> 00:47:16,165
Because you are!

562
00:47:19,292 --> 00:47:20,407
Let me go!

563
00:47:26,572 --> 00:47:27,687
Quicksand.

564
00:47:28,652 --> 00:47:29,767
Jinkies!

565
00:47:30,132 --> 00:47:32,851
Thanks, but you're stiII a suspect!

566
00:47:38,492 --> 00:47:40,084
Fred, over here.

567
00:47:51,692 --> 00:47:54,525
-What is it?
-Crawdad sheIIs.

568
00:47:56,132 --> 00:47:59,124
I guess the guys Iiked
your girIfriend's cooking, too.

569
00:47:59,212 --> 00:48:02,727
She's not my girIfriend, Daph.
I just said I enjoy her cooking.

570
00:48:02,812 --> 00:48:04,245
And what about Beau?

571
00:48:04,972 --> 00:48:06,246
What about him?

572
00:48:10,412 --> 00:48:13,449
-Daphne, are you--
-I can handIe myseIf, thank you.

573
00:48:15,412 --> 00:48:17,130
It's probabIy the gardener.

574
00:48:17,292 --> 00:48:19,248
We'II just see about that.

575
00:48:28,772 --> 00:48:31,047
Take it easy, Shag. It's just a mask!

576
00:48:32,972 --> 00:48:36,408
If this is a mask, Fred,
it's a pretty darn good one.

577
00:48:37,772 --> 00:48:41,048
Good one? It's the fakest,
cheesiest mask I've ever seen.

578
00:48:41,332 --> 00:48:42,321
Really?

579
00:48:43,692 --> 00:48:45,444
But it feels real!

580
00:48:46,892 --> 00:48:48,610
You're not puIIing hard enough!

581
00:48:48,692 --> 00:48:51,490
Okay, Mr. Macho. Why don't you try it?

582
00:48:52,012 --> 00:48:53,650
Sure. HoId this, Shag.

583
00:48:57,892 --> 00:49:00,360
Either hold it still or give it to Daphne.

584
00:49:02,652 --> 00:49:05,041
-lt's the gardener.
-No!

585
00:49:05,132 --> 00:49:07,600
-lt's the fisherman!
-No!

586
00:49:07,692 --> 00:49:09,922
-It's the ferryman.
-No.

587
00:49:10,652 --> 00:49:12,131
Maybe it's...

588
00:49:12,252 --> 00:49:13,241
...real!

589
00:49:24,692 --> 00:49:26,569
I toId you it wasn't a mask!

590
00:49:26,772 --> 00:49:28,444
It must be animatronic.

591
00:49:47,852 --> 00:49:49,570
Are you getting aII this?

592
00:50:01,412 --> 00:50:05,451
It's deja vu aII over again.
And we know what to do, eh, Scoob?

593
00:50:05,772 --> 00:50:07,524
Yeah! Run!

594
00:50:10,852 --> 00:50:12,888
It's a reguIar zombie jamboree!

595
00:50:15,412 --> 00:50:18,165
And I suppose they're aII animatronic, too.

596
00:50:18,252 --> 00:50:20,243
WeII, it is a possibiIity, Daph.

597
00:50:30,332 --> 00:50:33,130
You're not a skeptic, Fred.
You're in deniaI.

598
00:50:40,892 --> 00:50:43,531
It's Lena!
We Ieft her and Simone unprotected.

599
00:50:43,612 --> 00:50:44,806
Come on!

600
00:50:48,652 --> 00:50:50,768
The camera! It's quicksand!

601
00:50:52,812 --> 00:50:54,040
This way!

602
00:52:43,212 --> 00:52:46,329
Zoinks!
Someone's been pIaying with doIIs, Scoob!

603
00:52:46,412 --> 00:52:47,731
Yeah. DoIIs.

604
00:52:50,052 --> 00:52:51,451
Did you find the guys?

605
00:52:51,532 --> 00:52:54,888
Yeah, but we Iost them
when we found zombies!

606
00:52:55,052 --> 00:52:56,804
ReaI zombies!

607
00:52:56,972 --> 00:52:59,042
ReaI? ReaIIy reaI, Fred?

608
00:52:59,292 --> 00:53:01,328
I hate to admit it, but they were.

609
00:53:01,452 --> 00:53:03,761
Yeah, I finaIIy got my story...

610
00:53:03,852 --> 00:53:06,764
...and aII the proof sank in quicksand!

611
00:53:09,852 --> 00:53:10,841
Not again!

612
00:53:13,132 --> 00:53:14,850
This one Iooks Iike Daphne.

613
00:53:17,452 --> 00:53:18,567
Sorry, Fred!

614
00:53:20,972 --> 00:53:24,362
It's not my fauIt!
Something's controIIing me.

615
00:53:24,492 --> 00:53:25,971
Beau, get us down.

616
00:53:28,412 --> 00:53:30,368
I can't.

617
00:53:31,332 --> 00:53:32,924
Jinkies! Sorry!

618
00:53:39,172 --> 00:53:41,083
I wonder who made these doIIs.

619
00:53:41,892 --> 00:53:43,245
Look! Eyes!

620
00:53:58,252 --> 00:54:00,561
Come on! We've got to get to the house!

621
00:54:09,852 --> 00:54:12,889
-It was just a bunch of bats!
-Yeah.

622
00:54:16,812 --> 00:54:19,884
We're not Iooking for ghouIfriends, right?

623
00:54:29,132 --> 00:54:30,884
Let's get out of here!

624
00:54:41,212 --> 00:54:43,680
The generator must have gone out.
I'II go check it.

625
00:54:43,772 --> 00:54:46,570
No way.
I'm not Ietting you out of my sight.

626
00:55:05,052 --> 00:55:06,485
-Are you--
-AII right?

627
00:55:06,572 --> 00:55:07,561
Yeah.

628
00:55:08,372 --> 00:55:09,361
Thanks.

629
00:55:15,212 --> 00:55:16,565
What's going on?

630
00:55:16,652 --> 00:55:18,005
It was a nightmare.

631
00:55:18,092 --> 00:55:20,447
Ms. Lenoir and I went outside
to wait for you...

632
00:55:20,532 --> 00:55:22,488
...when we were attacked by these....

633
00:55:22,572 --> 00:55:23,607
Zombies?

634
00:55:23,692 --> 00:55:24,727
Yes!

635
00:55:24,812 --> 00:55:28,600
We ran back to the house, and
Ms. Lenoir opened this secret passageway.

636
00:55:28,772 --> 00:55:32,481
She said it was buiIt during the CiviI War
to hide from Union soIdiers.

637
00:55:32,572 --> 00:55:34,449
But the zombies came after us.

638
00:55:34,732 --> 00:55:37,292
They grabbed Ms. Lenoir
and dragged her away.

639
00:55:37,772 --> 00:55:40,161
Thank goodness you've come.

640
00:55:40,292 --> 00:55:43,284
You say the zombies
dragged Simone away.

641
00:55:43,532 --> 00:55:45,762
Yes, it was horribIe.

642
00:55:46,012 --> 00:55:49,049
Don't worry. We'II find her.
It's going to be okay!

643
00:55:51,212 --> 00:55:53,521
Come on, we've got to save Simone.

644
00:56:20,692 --> 00:56:22,364
Come on! This way.

645
00:56:41,332 --> 00:56:42,731
Where are we?

646
00:56:43,732 --> 00:56:46,690
Looks to me Iike a pIace for voodoo rituaIs.

647
00:56:47,212 --> 00:56:51,410
-But why don't we just ask Lena?
-What are you taIking about?

648
00:56:51,492 --> 00:56:54,882
Her story about Simone
getting dragged by zombies wasn't true.

649
00:56:55,052 --> 00:56:58,806
I saw the footprints of Simone's heeIs.
She wasn't dragged.

650
00:56:58,892 --> 00:57:00,723
She waIked down that tunneI.

651
00:57:05,772 --> 00:57:08,844
Very cIever, VeIma, but it's too Iate.

652
00:57:18,012 --> 00:57:20,685
Sorry, Freddy. I reaIIy do Iike you.

653
00:57:24,812 --> 00:57:27,201
What wouId you do if you didn't Iike me?

654
00:57:35,612 --> 00:57:36,886
Voodoo doIIs!

655
00:57:36,972 --> 00:57:39,486
These wax doIIs do come in handy.

656
00:57:43,892 --> 00:57:47,202
So that's where the cIeaning cIoth
for my gIasses went.

657
00:57:48,372 --> 00:57:50,169
Sorry I suspected you.

658
00:57:50,332 --> 00:57:52,050
ApoIogy accepted.

659
00:57:52,492 --> 00:57:56,690
The harvest moon wiII soon reach
the midnight point on this moondiaI...

660
00:57:56,812 --> 00:57:59,531
...and then the ceremony wiII begin.

661
00:57:59,892 --> 00:58:01,530
What ceremony?

662
00:58:02,572 --> 00:58:04,449
You won't get away with this.

663
00:58:04,972 --> 00:58:08,328
I've been getting away with it
for 200 years.

664
00:58:16,332 --> 00:58:19,244
At Ieast Scoob and Shaggy are stiII free.
Maybe--

665
00:58:19,332 --> 00:58:20,890
I heard that, Fred!

666
00:58:21,292 --> 00:58:22,964
Those two simpIetons.

667
00:58:23,052 --> 00:58:26,169
We didn't even bother
making wax doIIs of them.

668
00:58:26,252 --> 00:58:28,766
A waste of time and magic wax.

669
00:58:30,572 --> 00:58:32,528
Just what are you pIanning to do to us?

670
00:58:32,612 --> 00:58:33,761
It's simpIe.

671
00:58:33,852 --> 00:58:36,525
Every harvest moon
I must drain the Iife force...

672
00:58:36,612 --> 00:58:38,842
...from victims Iured to my isIand...

673
00:58:39,132 --> 00:58:40,963
...to preserve my immortaIity!

674
00:58:41,052 --> 00:58:44,169
This is more haunted stuff
than I reaIIy wanted.

675
00:58:59,092 --> 00:59:00,161
Jacques!

676
00:59:00,252 --> 00:59:02,561
-Are we ever gIad to see you!
-Yeah!

677
00:59:03,052 --> 00:59:04,610
There's no time to waste.

678
00:59:04,692 --> 00:59:06,648
I am happy to see y'aII.

679
00:59:23,852 --> 00:59:27,322
If you're as oId as you say you are,
then I'II bet you're the one...

680
00:59:27,412 --> 00:59:29,767
...who found Morgan Moonscar's treasure.

681
00:59:29,852 --> 00:59:31,763
Morgan Moonscar!

682
00:59:34,732 --> 00:59:36,962
He was the cause of all this!

683
00:59:39,892 --> 00:59:43,680
l was one of a group ofsettlers
who made this island our home.

684
00:59:43,772 --> 00:59:46,923
We looked to our cat god
for a bountiful harvest.

685
00:59:51,972 --> 00:59:55,362
Until that night when he came ashore.

686
01:00:24,172 --> 01:00:26,447
He drove the islanders into the bayou.

687
01:00:28,052 --> 01:00:30,008
All except for Lena and myself.

688
01:00:52,972 --> 01:00:55,122
We uttered a curse on the pirates...

689
01:00:55,252 --> 01:00:58,164
...to destroy them
as they had destroyed our island.

690
01:00:58,412 --> 01:01:00,004
Our wish was granted.

691
01:01:03,812 --> 01:01:06,963
We became cat creatures
and destroyed the pirates.

692
01:01:09,612 --> 01:01:13,651
OnIy afterwards did we discover
that invoking the cat god's power...

693
01:01:13,732 --> 01:01:15,643
...had cursed us as weII.

694
01:01:16,492 --> 01:01:19,165
Over the years,
boats continued to come to our isIand.

695
01:01:23,532 --> 01:01:27,525
One was full ofspice traders
who started a pepper plantation.

696
01:01:27,772 --> 01:01:29,728
The plantation flourished.

697
01:01:30,172 --> 01:01:32,970
At least until the harvest moon.

698
01:01:36,892 --> 01:01:41,044
Sometimes it became necessary
for Lena to Iure outsiders...

699
01:01:41,132 --> 01:01:42,645
...back to the isIand.

700
01:01:42,732 --> 01:01:44,688
Just Iike you Iured us.

701
01:01:44,852 --> 01:01:47,320
I've had years of practice.

702
01:01:47,532 --> 01:01:51,241
And those zombies are
just the poor souIs you drained.

703
01:01:51,372 --> 01:01:52,964
They were trying to warn us...

704
01:01:53,052 --> 01:01:55,771
...so we wouIdn't suffer
the same fate they did!

705
01:01:56,092 --> 01:01:59,402
Pretty smart for a teIevision reporter.

706
01:02:01,052 --> 01:02:04,328
Sounds Iike Jacques has found
your frightened friends.

707
01:02:04,492 --> 01:02:05,766
Jacques?

708
01:02:05,852 --> 01:02:10,368
We needed a ferry driver.
The oId man wanted immortaIity...

709
01:02:10,572 --> 01:02:12,483
...so we gave it to him.

710
01:02:18,852 --> 01:02:20,763
Going somewhere?

711
01:02:24,492 --> 01:02:27,484
What's the matter? Cat got your tongue?

712
01:02:40,092 --> 01:02:42,083
Come on, Scoob. Now's our chance!

713
01:02:46,332 --> 01:02:47,765
Jacques is in troubIe!

714
01:02:47,852 --> 01:02:50,810
Forget about him!
They must be drained now...

715
01:02:50,892 --> 01:02:53,929
...whiIe the moonIight is
in the midnight aIignment!

716
01:03:15,252 --> 01:03:17,846
What are you guys doing, charades?

717
01:03:18,052 --> 01:03:19,804
Jinkies! Look out!

718
01:03:25,132 --> 01:03:27,965
I've had enough of that meddIing dog!

719
01:03:28,172 --> 01:03:29,685
Dog? Where?

720
01:04:22,892 --> 01:04:24,484
If I can just....

721
01:04:25,492 --> 01:04:26,527
Oh, no!

722
01:04:50,172 --> 01:04:52,766
Shaggy! The zombies are the good guys!

723
01:04:53,012 --> 01:04:55,162
Are you out of your mind?

724
01:05:11,732 --> 01:05:13,484
I'm free.

725
01:05:14,532 --> 01:05:16,409
This is a piece of Lena's bIouse.

726
01:05:34,892 --> 01:05:36,371
Come on, Scoob!

727
01:05:51,532 --> 01:05:54,922
You're not the onIy ones
who Iike pIaying with doIIs.

728
01:06:09,652 --> 01:06:11,051
Are you guys okay?

729
01:06:15,732 --> 01:06:18,804
I was beginning to feeI Iike a raisin!

730
01:06:51,252 --> 01:06:53,322
Looks Iike your nine Iives are up!

731
01:07:21,012 --> 01:07:23,480
Zoinks! What's happening to them?

732
01:07:24,052 --> 01:07:26,486
Their spirits have been avenged...

733
01:07:26,572 --> 01:07:29,166
...so they can finaIIy rest in peace.

734
01:07:36,812 --> 01:07:38,484
Thank you.

735
01:07:40,732 --> 01:07:42,484
I can't beIieve aII this!

736
01:07:43,172 --> 01:07:46,130
Without our videotape,
no one eIse wiII, either.

737
01:07:46,572 --> 01:07:48,449
I've got nothing for my show.

738
01:07:49,212 --> 01:07:51,601
The poIice wiII never beIieve
this story either.

739
01:07:51,692 --> 01:07:53,011
Don't be so sure.

740
01:07:53,092 --> 01:07:54,605
I'm Detective Beau NeviIIe.

741
01:07:54,692 --> 01:07:57,923
Been working undercover
investigating the isIand disappearances.

742
01:07:58,012 --> 01:08:01,721
Jinkies! So that's why
you were digging around.

743
01:08:01,812 --> 01:08:05,009
Yes, ma'am.
Just trying to dig up evidence.

744
01:08:06,132 --> 01:08:09,522
Not positive my superiors
wiII buy this story though.

745
01:08:10,332 --> 01:08:14,883
Beau.... Detective NeviIIe,
have you ever been on TV?

746
01:08:21,892 --> 01:08:26,010
You know, Fred, with aII the zombies
and cat creatures gone...

747
01:08:26,172 --> 01:08:28,447
...this is a pretty romantic spot.

748
01:08:28,532 --> 01:08:29,487
Yeah.

749
01:08:29,572 --> 01:08:31,961
The bayou casts a speII aII its own.

750
01:08:32,212 --> 01:08:35,124
No matter how hard you try
to soIve its mysteries...

751
01:08:35,372 --> 01:08:37,522
...it aIways keeps something hidden.

752
01:08:38,132 --> 01:08:42,364
That was beautifuI, Detective NeviIIe.
There's a bit of a poet in you.

753
01:08:43,292 --> 01:08:45,044
I don't know about that, ma'am.

754
01:08:45,132 --> 01:08:48,442
But I wouId Iike
to write detective stories someday.

755
01:08:48,532 --> 01:08:53,287
Jinkies! I've aIways been crazy
about a good detective, story, that is.

756
01:08:53,572 --> 01:08:55,608
I even own my own mystery bookstore.

757
01:08:55,692 --> 01:08:56,966
No kidding.

758
01:09:02,372 --> 01:09:03,407
Where's Scooby?

759
01:09:03,492 --> 01:09:06,290
He's picking a peck of peppers for the road.

760
01:09:07,292 --> 01:09:08,611
Hurry up, Scoob!

761
01:09:08,732 --> 01:09:10,131
We're puIIing out!

762
01:09:10,252 --> 01:09:12,049
Okay!

763
01:09:37,092 --> 01:09:38,844
Darn tourists!

764
01:09:44,732 --> 01:09:47,007
Look what I've got for you, oId buddy.

765
01:09:48,372 --> 01:09:51,125
We're finaIIy going
to have a nice peacefuI meaI.

766
01:10:06,412 --> 01:10:09,768
Shaggy! Cats! Yikes!
