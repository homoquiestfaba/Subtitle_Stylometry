1
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:11,649
Excuse me, honey.

2
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:15,233
Excuse me, honey, hey.

3
00:01:16,132 --> 00:01:19,211
You got a light, sweetie pie?
What's up?

4
00:01:19,212 --> 00:01:20,712
Actually, I don't.

5
00:01:21,802 --> 00:01:24,809
Well you look like a nice working man.

6
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:27,830
How much a job like this pay?

7
00:01:27,831 --> 00:01:29,921
That's minimum wage.

8
00:01:29,922 --> 00:01:31,631
You wanna go in the back real quick?

9
00:01:32,831 --> 00:01:34,939
Look man, can't you see I'm working?

10
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:36,729
I don't trick anyways.

11
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:40,207
Look, I'm just trying to
make some money to get home.

12
00:01:40,208 --> 00:01:41,875
- Really?
- You know?

13
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:45,382
Oh, you kinda cute.

14
00:01:47,885 --> 00:01:50,916
You gonna leave me alone?

15
00:01:50,917 --> 00:01:53,054
You gonna leave me alone?
Yes!

16
00:01:53,055 --> 00:01:54,805
I'll leave you alone.

17
00:01:55,904 --> 00:01:56,904
Thank you.

18
00:02:15,242 --> 00:02:16,993
Hey, what's taking so long?

19
00:02:16,994 --> 00:02:18,793
What you mean, that's a lot of shit.

20
00:02:18,794 --> 00:02:20,422
Get your ass back here
and lift some boxes.

21
00:02:20,423 --> 00:02:22,211
Shut your ass up.

22
00:02:22,212 --> 00:02:23,212
Yep, time to go.

23
00:02:23,213 --> 00:02:25,045
Let's go, we gotta go.

24
00:02:27,252 --> 00:02:28,335
Let's move.

25
00:02:42,123 --> 00:02:43,354
Man, shut the fuck up.

26
00:02:43,355 --> 00:02:45,188
It's all right, man.

27
00:05:07,194 --> 00:05:09,111
I missed you so much.

28
00:05:13,114 --> 00:05:15,197
Why didn't you call me?

29
00:05:16,355 --> 00:05:19,033
I just had some business to handle.

30
00:05:19,034 --> 00:05:20,875
Is that so?

31
00:05:20,876 --> 00:05:21,876
Yeah.

32
00:05:24,626 --> 00:05:27,446
I can't do this anymore.

33
00:05:27,447 --> 00:05:28,780
Can't do what?

34
00:05:32,505 --> 00:05:33,672
My marriage.

35
00:05:35,546 --> 00:05:37,046
I wanna leave him.

36
00:05:39,087 --> 00:05:40,614
I need money.

37
00:05:40,615 --> 00:05:42,673
I have money.

38
00:05:42,674 --> 00:05:43,865
I'm talking about the kind of money

39
00:05:43,866 --> 00:05:45,783
that would have us set.

40
00:05:50,676 --> 00:05:53,093
Not going back to being poor.

41
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,823
Think I know a way.

42
00:06:09,926 --> 00:06:12,338
It wasn't always like this for me.

43
00:06:12,339 --> 00:06:13,778
I remember a time when I smiled

44
00:06:13,779 --> 00:06:17,218
and felt like life couldn't be any better.

45
00:06:17,219 --> 00:06:19,027
Over time, that changed.

46
00:06:30,648 --> 00:06:32,148
Hughes was my ace.

47
00:06:33,448 --> 00:06:36,826
The one I can depend on for anything.

48
00:06:36,827 --> 00:06:38,178
But also the one that stayed

49
00:06:38,179 --> 00:06:40,725
keeping me mixed up in something.

50
00:06:40,726 --> 00:06:43,393
Hughes, he lived for the thrill.

51
00:06:45,152 --> 00:06:49,069
If you could have one
wish, what would it be?

52
00:06:50,792 --> 00:06:53,042
Would be Dad being alive.

53
00:06:56,651 --> 00:06:58,981
What was he like?

54
00:06:58,982 --> 00:07:01,315
He was better than my dad.

55
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:06,123
Never put his hands on Mama.

56
00:07:08,232 --> 00:07:11,573
Always took care of his family.

57
00:07:11,574 --> 00:07:13,907
What more could you ask for?

58
00:07:15,243 --> 00:07:17,076
You act just like him.

59
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:20,980
Mom says that all the time.

60
00:07:23,363 --> 00:07:24,363
Shamu?

61
00:07:25,401 --> 00:07:27,401
Hold up, I'm thinking.

62
00:07:28,374 --> 00:07:29,374
Got you.

63
00:07:32,974 --> 00:07:33,974
Checkmate.

64
00:07:38,923 --> 00:07:42,362
Never let anything or anyone
distract you from your mission.

65
00:07:42,363 --> 00:07:46,280
'Cause just like this
game, you'll lose it all.

66
00:07:49,286 --> 00:07:51,325
I met Frank through Hughes,

67
00:07:51,326 --> 00:07:54,085
but we quickly became close friends.

68
00:07:54,086 --> 00:07:56,804
Frank and Hughes knew each
other when they were kids,

69
00:07:56,805 --> 00:07:58,665
but Frank joined the Marines at 17

70
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:02,126
and went to fight the war in Afghanistan.

71
00:08:02,127 --> 00:08:04,794
He came back a different person.

72
00:08:28,315 --> 00:08:30,383
Where's your boy?

73
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:33,663
Maybe he's just running a little late.

74
00:08:33,664 --> 00:08:35,514
I think your boy trying to burn me.

75
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:38,092
Nobody's trying to burn you, all right?

76
00:08:38,093 --> 00:08:39,954
I can promise you that.

77
00:08:39,955 --> 00:08:41,474
Your boy's a bum.

78
00:08:41,475 --> 00:08:44,823
Let's just keep this respectful.

79
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:47,301
What about my respect?

80
00:08:47,302 --> 00:08:49,642
You know I don't play
about my money, Cliff.

81
00:08:49,643 --> 00:08:50,476
I'll set up the meeting

82
00:08:50,477 --> 00:08:53,741
as soon as I figure out
where he is, all right?

83
00:08:53,742 --> 00:08:58,573
If your boy don't show
up, I'm gonna hurt him.

84
00:08:58,574 --> 00:08:59,991
He'll be there.

85
00:09:18,701 --> 00:09:22,513
Eight, seven, six, five,

86
00:09:22,514 --> 00:09:26,205
four, three, two, one!

87
00:10:32,823 --> 00:10:36,464
Woo baby, happy new year!

88
00:10:36,465 --> 00:10:39,632
Winning.

89
00:10:40,924 --> 00:10:43,672
Yo Frank, what's your
new year's resolution?

90
00:10:43,673 --> 00:10:45,392
I don't have a new year's resolution.

91
00:10:45,393 --> 00:10:47,702
What you mean you ain't
got a new year's resolution?

92
00:10:47,703 --> 00:10:48,536
Nigga, that's like you saying

93
00:10:48,537 --> 00:10:50,641
you don't believe in Christmas.

94
00:10:50,642 --> 00:10:51,900
I don't.

95
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:52,869
All right, what about that time

96
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:55,428
you bought Candice that
expensive ass necklace?

97
00:10:55,429 --> 00:10:58,268
Man, that was a long ass time ago.

98
00:10:58,269 --> 00:11:00,527
Listen, I don't need no
new year's resolution

99
00:11:00,528 --> 00:11:02,506
to put things into existence.

100
00:11:02,507 --> 00:11:03,906
I put things into existence every day

101
00:11:03,907 --> 00:11:05,907
by putting that work in.

102
00:11:06,898 --> 00:11:09,268
All right man, you don't
gotta get all uppity, all right?

103
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:11,066
It's just a tradition.

104
00:11:11,067 --> 00:11:15,537
All right, what's your
new year's resolution?

105
00:11:15,538 --> 00:11:17,026
You already know, playa.

106
00:11:17,027 --> 00:11:19,039
It's fucking these bitches
and getting in this money.

107
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,949
Ain't that right, playa?

108
00:11:23,079 --> 00:11:25,162
Why you didn't show up?

109
00:11:26,248 --> 00:11:28,138
I was busy.

110
00:11:28,139 --> 00:11:29,472
You were busy?

111
00:11:30,819 --> 00:11:32,405
So not only do you owe the man money,

112
00:11:32,406 --> 00:11:34,858
but you playing with his time as well.

113
00:11:34,859 --> 00:11:36,565
Yo, I said I'm gonna pay him.

114
00:11:36,566 --> 00:11:38,306
Why you keep bringing this shit up?

115
00:11:38,307 --> 00:11:40,546
Because that's what
you said the last time,

116
00:11:40,547 --> 00:11:43,746
and the time before that.

117
00:11:43,747 --> 00:11:46,084
I went out of my way
to set this meeting up

118
00:11:46,085 --> 00:11:48,346
after you pulled a gun on him.

119
00:11:48,347 --> 00:11:49,876
What's up, you scared now, huh?

120
00:11:49,877 --> 00:11:52,375
You owe him money, you pay him.

121
00:11:52,376 --> 00:11:54,459
What you gonna do, huh?

122
00:12:32,218 --> 00:12:33,218
Wake up.

123
00:12:37,216 --> 00:12:39,633
You're one fine piece of ass.

124
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:42,094
You know that?

125
00:12:43,727 --> 00:12:44,727
Yes.

126
00:12:46,727 --> 00:12:47,727
Good girl.

127
00:12:51,148 --> 00:12:52,898
Where were you today?

128
00:12:54,175 --> 00:12:58,842
I called earlier, and nothing.

129
00:13:00,689 --> 00:13:02,939
I was at the hairdresser.

130
00:13:05,676 --> 00:13:09,509
Don't ever go missing
on me like that again.

131
00:13:11,217 --> 00:13:12,550
I don't like it.

132
00:13:15,409 --> 00:13:16,576
I get nervous.

133
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:22,256
You know what happens when I get nervous?

134
00:13:23,319 --> 00:13:24,319
Bad things.

135
00:13:26,876 --> 00:13:29,126
Bad things start to happen.

136
00:13:34,888 --> 00:13:37,888
Now give me a kiss.

137
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:51,456
Why don't you get ready,

138
00:13:51,457 --> 00:13:54,095
and I'll take you to
dinner at Beverly Hills.

139
00:13:54,096 --> 00:13:55,763
Would you like that?

140
00:13:58,157 --> 00:14:00,157
Good, good.

141
00:14:11,886 --> 00:14:12,886
Hey.

142
00:14:14,855 --> 00:14:16,466
Why you keep doing this?

143
00:14:16,467 --> 00:14:18,804
Why you keep doing this?

144
00:14:18,805 --> 00:14:19,805
Thanks.

145
00:14:21,555 --> 00:14:22,722
So what's new?

146
00:14:23,934 --> 00:14:24,934
Nothing.

147
00:14:27,686 --> 00:14:30,019
Old man Barry got caught up.

148
00:14:31,035 --> 00:14:34,493
Some crazy dude walked up
to him, pulled out his gun,

149
00:14:34,494 --> 00:14:37,411
and shot him in the face six times.

150
00:14:40,496 --> 00:14:41,496
Jesus.

151
00:14:43,587 --> 00:14:47,146
Boy, I tell you, it's always something.

152
00:14:47,147 --> 00:14:48,175
Speaking of which, Frank,

153
00:14:48,176 --> 00:14:50,847
I need you to talk to your brother.

154
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:52,567
He needs your help.

155
00:14:52,568 --> 00:14:53,666
He's cutting class,

156
00:14:53,667 --> 00:14:56,416
I'm getting several calls from the school.

157
00:14:58,345 --> 00:14:59,178
Gun down.

158
00:14:59,178 --> 00:15:00,011
- Don't worry about him.
- Hey, hey!

159
00:15:00,012 --> 00:15:02,424
- Gun down.
- Shut the fuck up.

160
00:15:02,425 --> 00:15:04,256
Where's the bomb?
Gun down, gun!

161
00:15:04,257 --> 00:15:05,657
Where's the bomb at, Amir?

162
00:15:05,658 --> 00:15:06,809
- No bomb.
- Where's the bomb at?

163
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:07,810
No bomb.

164
00:15:08,497 --> 00:15:10,433
I think he needs a little motivation.

165
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:15,561
Why you are doing?

166
00:15:15,562 --> 00:15:16,912
Why, no bomb!

167
00:15:16,913 --> 00:15:17,814
No!
Amir.

168
00:15:17,815 --> 00:15:18,996
Where's the bomb, Amir?

169
00:15:18,997 --> 00:15:20,169
No bomb!

170
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:21,170
No, no, no!

171
00:15:21,171 --> 00:15:22,831
No, hey, I no bomb!

172
00:15:22,832 --> 00:15:24,327
I no bomb!
Take the fucking gun,

173
00:15:24,328 --> 00:15:25,720
get rid of him.
I no bomb.

174
00:15:25,721 --> 00:15:26,554
He's here to kill us.

175
00:15:26,555 --> 00:15:27,817
Gun down, gun down.

176
00:15:27,818 --> 00:15:28,651
Gun down, no, no, no.
He's here to kill you.

177
00:15:28,651 --> 00:15:29,484
No!

178
00:15:29,485 --> 00:15:30,885
Pull the fucking trigger, Miller.

179
00:15:40,017 --> 00:15:41,017
Frank!

180
00:15:44,657 --> 00:15:46,740
Okay, I'll talk to him.

181
00:15:48,747 --> 00:15:50,926
Frank was a family guy.

182
00:15:50,927 --> 00:15:55,446
No matter what, he always
took care of his family first.

183
00:15:55,447 --> 00:15:59,351
Except when it came to his
on-and-off girlfriend Flynn,

184
00:15:59,352 --> 00:16:01,825
who he was crazy over.

185
00:16:01,826 --> 00:16:02,671
Hey.

186
00:16:02,672 --> 00:16:04,390
What are you doing here?

187
00:16:04,391 --> 00:16:05,702
What?

188
00:16:05,703 --> 00:16:06,934
What you mean?

189
00:16:06,935 --> 00:16:09,902
You're scaring me, Frank.

190
00:16:09,903 --> 00:16:10,775
Where you been?

191
00:16:10,776 --> 00:16:15,566
Why you ain't been answering
any of my phone calls?

192
00:16:15,567 --> 00:16:16,638
What's wrong with you?

193
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,173
Honestly, you're making
me real uncomfortable,

194
00:16:18,174 --> 00:16:19,590
so please leave me alone,

195
00:16:19,591 --> 00:16:22,958
or you'll force me to
get a restraining order.

196
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:24,783
Frank, let go of my arm.

197
00:16:24,784 --> 00:16:26,264
Just chill.

198
00:16:26,265 --> 00:16:28,432
Let go of my arm, Frank.

199
00:16:33,407 --> 00:16:35,294
What you want me to do, I apologize!

200
00:16:35,295 --> 00:16:38,376
I want you to leave me alone!

201
00:16:38,377 --> 00:16:40,201
Fuck, man.

202
00:17:15,449 --> 00:17:17,464
What you looking at?

203
00:17:17,465 --> 00:17:18,465
You.

204
00:17:20,489 --> 00:17:22,656
I like watching you sleep.

205
00:17:23,585 --> 00:17:25,400
That's enough.

206
00:17:25,401 --> 00:17:28,151
I'll tell you when it's enough.

207
00:17:30,577 --> 00:17:32,577
Can I ask you something?

208
00:17:33,961 --> 00:17:34,961
Go ahead.

209
00:17:37,153 --> 00:17:41,403
Is it just the pleasure
you desire about a woman?

210
00:17:43,946 --> 00:17:47,490
I desire everything about a woman.

211
00:17:47,491 --> 00:17:51,241
The way she thinks, the way she walks,

212
00:17:52,591 --> 00:17:56,341
the way she talks, the way she smells.

213
00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:01,040
Every little detail interests me.

214
00:18:03,284 --> 00:18:08,034
You are the complete opposite
of any man I've ever met.

215
00:18:09,872 --> 00:18:13,039
Is that a bad thing or a good thing?

216
00:18:13,977 --> 00:18:15,560
I don't know yet.

217
00:19:11,574 --> 00:19:13,752
The more I wanted to escape,

218
00:19:13,753 --> 00:19:16,632
the harder it became to do so.

219
00:19:16,633 --> 00:19:19,613
I was stuck in between
the loyalty to my friends

220
00:19:19,614 --> 00:19:21,781
and the loyalty to myself.

221
00:19:22,701 --> 00:19:25,368
At some point, I have to choose.

222
00:19:44,842 --> 00:19:45,842
What up?

223
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:48,434
Not much.

224
00:19:48,435 --> 00:19:50,518
Why you missing school?

225
00:19:52,395 --> 00:19:53,895
- For real?
- Yeah.

226
00:19:56,355 --> 00:20:00,613
I feel like it ain't no
point in me doing it anymore.

227
00:20:00,614 --> 00:20:01,515
We don't even have books,

228
00:20:01,516 --> 00:20:03,081
and I know what I wanna do with my life.

229
00:20:03,082 --> 00:20:04,521
Yeah, what's that?

230
00:20:04,522 --> 00:20:05,642
Focus on my music.

231
00:20:05,643 --> 00:20:08,841
Yeah, but you still need an education.

232
00:20:08,842 --> 00:20:09,675
How you gonna write rhymes

233
00:20:09,676 --> 00:20:11,842
if you don't know how
to handle your business?

234
00:20:11,843 --> 00:20:15,053
Use a vocabulary and
structure your thoughts?

235
00:20:15,054 --> 00:20:16,054
Whatever.

236
00:20:49,244 --> 00:20:50,994
I got our next job.

237
00:20:54,332 --> 00:20:55,415
It's a house.

238
00:20:57,092 --> 00:21:00,259
Possibly two million dollars in there.

239
00:21:01,143 --> 00:21:04,050
Probably the easiest job we've ever had.

240
00:21:04,051 --> 00:21:05,403
Ain't nothing ever that easy.

241
00:21:05,404 --> 00:21:06,571
It's simple.

242
00:21:07,852 --> 00:21:11,269
We go to the house and we find the money.

243
00:21:12,903 --> 00:21:14,251
Where'd you hear about it?

244
00:21:14,252 --> 00:21:15,771
It's best you don't know.

245
00:21:15,772 --> 00:21:17,342
Keeping secrets now?

246
00:21:17,343 --> 00:21:20,343
I'll break down the details later.

247
00:21:21,412 --> 00:21:26,245
Another thing, I'm going
away after this, for good.

248
00:21:27,815 --> 00:21:29,398
Very far from here.

249
00:21:33,614 --> 00:21:35,681
What about everything we built?

250
00:21:35,682 --> 00:21:37,682
Nothing lasts forever.

251
00:21:40,235 --> 00:21:43,318
You gotta get out while you're ahead.

252
00:21:46,202 --> 00:21:49,681
My gut's been telling
me that for a while now.

253
00:21:49,682 --> 00:21:52,599
The more I experience that feeling,

254
00:21:54,363 --> 00:21:56,613
the more paranoid I become.

255
00:22:03,385 --> 00:22:05,885
I don't like feeling paranoid.

256
00:22:09,441 --> 00:22:11,459
What happened with you and Trina?

257
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:14,367
We ditched fourth period and
went back to her crib, bro.

258
00:22:14,368 --> 00:22:15,600
Word?

259
00:22:15,601 --> 00:22:17,946
Yeah, she said her moms was at work.

260
00:22:17,947 --> 00:22:20,267
We was going at it.

261
00:22:20,268 --> 00:22:21,685
You smash that?

262
00:22:22,565 --> 00:22:24,244
Not really.

263
00:22:24,245 --> 00:22:25,245
Kinda.

264
00:22:26,508 --> 00:22:28,565
What you mean?

265
00:22:28,566 --> 00:22:31,125
We in her room, right?

266
00:22:31,126 --> 00:22:34,347
I strip her down, she
got them big ass titties.

267
00:22:34,348 --> 00:22:36,564
We just making out and shit.

268
00:22:36,565 --> 00:22:38,296
Pulled out the condom.

269
00:22:38,297 --> 00:22:40,363
She put it on me.

270
00:22:40,364 --> 00:22:42,747
As soon as I put it in,

271
00:22:42,748 --> 00:22:45,856
both her moms come walking
through the front door.

272
00:22:45,857 --> 00:22:48,190
Damn, how'd that go?

273
00:22:49,525 --> 00:22:51,867
Trying to make my way out of there.

274
00:22:51,868 --> 00:22:54,947
Open up the door to get
out, she's standing there,

275
00:22:54,948 --> 00:22:57,496
staring right at the both of us.

276
00:22:57,497 --> 00:23:00,080
She whooped her ass and my ass.

277
00:23:07,165 --> 00:23:08,637
Hey, stay on the lookout.

278
00:23:08,638 --> 00:23:09,638
Got you.

279
00:23:15,925 --> 00:23:17,416
Damn, that shit coming out nice.

280
00:23:17,417 --> 00:23:20,250
Yeah nigga, my shit always nice.

281
00:23:21,947 --> 00:23:23,722
Police, don't move!

282
00:23:23,723 --> 00:23:24,723
Run!

283
00:24:11,523 --> 00:24:13,563
It's gonna be okay, Mama.

284
00:24:17,514 --> 00:24:19,514
It's gonna be all right.

285
00:25:12,121 --> 00:25:13,749
What are you doing?

286
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:15,629
Nothing, just chilling.

287
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:18,050
I got a lot going on right now.

288
00:25:18,051 --> 00:25:22,101
Yeah, there's a lot
going on with me as well.

289
00:25:22,102 --> 00:25:23,852
Hughes, I'm pregnant.

290
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:28,660
Hello, are you there?

291
00:25:29,691 --> 00:25:31,608
Yeah, yeah, I'm here.

292
00:25:33,681 --> 00:25:36,348
I don't wanna get an abortion.

293
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:43,390
Look, I can't force you to
do anything you don't want to.

294
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:45,423
So what now?

295
00:25:48,131 --> 00:25:51,214
I'll take care of you and the baby.

296
00:25:54,771 --> 00:25:57,438
I did not know what to expect.

297
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:04,010
Look, get some rest and
I'll call you tomorrow.

298
00:26:04,011 --> 00:26:06,011
Okay, bye.

299
00:26:07,049 --> 00:26:09,132
All right, bye.

300
00:26:23,822 --> 00:26:24,822
Hey Flynn.

301
00:26:28,351 --> 00:26:32,184
Give me a call back
whenever you get a chance.

302
00:26:34,508 --> 00:26:37,008
Going through a lot right now.

303
00:26:38,688 --> 00:26:40,355
Need to talk to you.

304
00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:55,330
I'm sorry if you felt like I
disrespected you or whatever.

305
00:26:55,829 --> 00:27:00,162
But us not talking is not
helping us out in any way.

306
00:27:03,507 --> 00:27:06,095
So just give me a call back when you can,

307
00:27:06,096 --> 00:27:07,929
I need to talk to you.

308
00:27:11,709 --> 00:27:14,376
Listen, I'm gonna tell you this.

309
00:27:15,589 --> 00:27:20,089
I swear to god, you better
not be with no other nigga.

310
00:27:21,698 --> 00:27:24,948
Answer the fucking phone, call me back.

311
00:27:32,178 --> 00:27:34,559
Wait a minute, let me say something.

312
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:37,919
Since a kid, I've always
wanted to be a police officer.

313
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:40,559
There's a great sense of pride
from putting on that uniform

314
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,977
and serving the people of this city.

315
00:27:42,978 --> 00:27:46,098
There's nothing easy about this job.

316
00:27:46,099 --> 00:27:47,778
I've been a cop for over 10 years now,

317
00:27:47,779 --> 00:27:50,799
and I've given my life to this position.

318
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:53,479
Every night we go out to
protect these streets,

319
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,538
we're dealing with drug dealers,

320
00:27:55,539 --> 00:27:58,622
gang bangers, rapists, and murderers.

321
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:01,959
What I did was self defense.

322
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:05,698
That kid was carrying a weapon,
and I had to defend myself.

323
00:28:05,699 --> 00:28:08,736
In that situation, I had
to make a split decision.

324
00:28:08,737 --> 00:28:10,658
It was either my life or his,

325
00:28:10,659 --> 00:28:12,857
and I had to do what I had to do.

326
00:28:12,858 --> 00:28:14,150
Please, no more questions.

327
00:28:21,435 --> 00:28:23,975
We still good for that job?

328
00:28:23,976 --> 00:28:26,542
'Cause I need that bread.

329
00:28:26,543 --> 00:28:30,263
Yeah, we still good for the job, man.

330
00:28:30,264 --> 00:28:35,264
Should leave Frank out of
this, take care of it ourselves.

331
00:28:35,384 --> 00:28:38,893
He kinda been going through a lot lately.

332
00:28:38,894 --> 00:28:41,103
He'll get himself together.

333
00:28:41,104 --> 00:28:43,437
We do nothing without Frank.

334
00:28:52,247 --> 00:28:53,398
So what's up?

335
00:28:53,399 --> 00:28:55,758
You still on that leaving town shit?

336
00:28:55,759 --> 00:28:59,259
Yeah, not until things calm down.

337
00:29:01,345 --> 00:29:05,758
Meanwhile, we need to
keep an eye on Frank.

338
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:07,009
Yeah, I know.

339
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:10,669
He kinda been bugging out lately.

340
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:15,939
Did you pick up the
guns like I told you to?

341
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:18,107
Yeah, I took care of it.

342
00:29:20,431 --> 00:29:23,190
We gotta make sure he
don't do nothing stupid.

343
00:29:23,191 --> 00:29:25,191
It's for his own safety.

344
00:29:26,678 --> 00:29:28,595
Yeah, you right, man.

345
00:29:29,627 --> 00:29:32,499
I ain't never seen him
talk like this before.

346
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:33,500
Bugging out.

347
00:29:35,117 --> 00:29:38,950
If I lost a brother,
I'd be bugging out too.

348
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:44,222
And that's what I'm
making sure don't happen.

349
00:29:44,223 --> 00:29:46,390
Yeah, I guess you right.

350
00:30:01,504 --> 00:30:02,641
What's good?

351
00:30:02,642 --> 00:30:04,539
What's up, man, how are you?

352
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:08,160
Same shit, just out here hustling.

353
00:30:08,161 --> 00:30:12,580
Hey yo, sorry about your
little brother, man.

354
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:15,073
Appreciate it.

355
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:18,280
You brought the piece?

356
00:30:18,281 --> 00:30:19,281
Yeah, oh.

357
00:30:21,372 --> 00:30:22,455
Check it out.

358
00:30:31,199 --> 00:30:33,187
How much you want for it?

359
00:30:33,188 --> 00:30:36,785
For you, just give me 350.

360
00:30:36,786 --> 00:30:38,286
All right, cool.

361
00:31:06,174 --> 00:31:10,100
Listen, Frank, we gonna
help you get past this.

362
00:31:10,101 --> 00:31:12,693
We gonna put this behind us.

363
00:31:12,694 --> 00:31:13,633
So I'm just supposed to forget

364
00:31:13,634 --> 00:31:15,243
about everything that happened?

365
00:31:15,244 --> 00:31:18,030
Nah, not at all.

366
00:31:18,031 --> 00:31:19,984
I'm just saying, there's one thing

367
00:31:19,985 --> 00:31:23,312
that's guaranteed in life, that's death.

368
00:31:23,313 --> 00:31:25,146
You can't escape that.

369
00:31:26,334 --> 00:31:27,744
No, how about y'all
just get up out of here

370
00:31:27,745 --> 00:31:29,592
and give me some time by myself?

371
00:31:29,593 --> 00:31:31,664
We're not going anywhere.

372
00:31:31,665 --> 00:31:33,431
Daniel was a brother to all of us.

373
00:31:33,432 --> 00:31:35,232
Hey bro, I don't wanna
hear that shit right now.

374
00:31:35,233 --> 00:31:36,111
Just calm down.

375
00:31:36,111 --> 00:31:37,111
Calm down?

376
00:31:38,734 --> 00:31:42,944
My little brother was
killed for no reason.

377
00:31:42,945 --> 00:31:44,778
A innocent little kid.

378
00:31:47,145 --> 00:31:50,895
How many times have we
seen this shit happen?

379
00:31:54,183 --> 00:31:57,766
I think it's time we
do something about it.

380
00:33:15,818 --> 00:33:17,068
No thank you.

381
00:33:29,461 --> 00:33:33,520
What are you gonna miss
most about this place?

382
00:33:33,521 --> 00:33:34,521
Nothing.

383
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:40,810
I've done some bad things in my past,

384
00:33:40,811 --> 00:33:44,311
and this city constantly reminds me of it.

385
00:33:46,304 --> 00:33:51,304
We gotta look forward,
towards the undiscovered.

386
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:56,593
What about your family?

387
00:33:58,918 --> 00:34:01,251
Maybe if they were around.

388
00:34:03,418 --> 00:34:05,335
I never met my parents.

389
00:34:07,614 --> 00:34:09,053
I grew up in a foster home,

390
00:34:09,054 --> 00:34:12,387
where I was told I wouldn't be anything,

391
00:34:15,272 --> 00:34:18,772
and that I wouldn't make it in this world.

392
00:34:24,549 --> 00:34:28,382
Closest thing I have to
family are my friends.

393
00:34:30,094 --> 00:34:31,094
I love them.

394
00:34:32,462 --> 00:34:34,129
They're my brothers.

395
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:37,772
We're just at a point

396
00:34:37,773 --> 00:34:42,190
where we all need different
things in life, you know?

397
00:34:46,475 --> 00:34:49,725
We grow, we change,

398
00:34:50,987 --> 00:34:52,154
and we evolve.

399
00:34:55,488 --> 00:34:58,821
As human beings, we have to accept that.

400
00:35:23,512 --> 00:35:25,429
Have you talked to him?

401
00:35:27,883 --> 00:35:28,883
Nah.

402
00:35:30,862 --> 00:35:32,362
What should we do?

403
00:35:36,862 --> 00:35:40,520
We're gonna have to do it without him.

404
00:35:40,521 --> 00:35:42,354
I can't turn back now.

405
00:35:45,822 --> 00:35:47,155
Let's do this.

406
00:37:47,739 --> 00:37:48,739
Fuck.

407
00:37:55,097 --> 00:37:57,514
Don't make a fucking sound.

408
00:37:59,686 --> 00:38:01,365
Where is he?

409
00:38:01,366 --> 00:38:04,699
- He's taking a shower.
- Take me to him.

410
00:38:50,083 --> 00:38:51,602
It's a sad day in our city.

411
00:38:51,603 --> 00:38:53,922
Police officer Sylvester
Carter was shot to death

412
00:38:53,923 --> 00:38:57,149
in his home on the 500th
block of Tampa Avenue.

413
00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:58,530
A masked intruder entered the home

414
00:38:58,531 --> 00:39:02,010
where his wife and young son
were, armed with a firearm.

415
00:39:02,011 --> 00:39:03,890
There are currently no
suspects in the case,

416
00:39:03,891 --> 00:39:05,583
but police have said that they are looking

417
00:39:05,584 --> 00:39:06,890
for an African American male.

418
00:39:06,891 --> 00:39:10,549
Man, this shit's all over the news.

419
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:12,828
We just need to figure
out where Frank is,

420
00:39:12,829 --> 00:39:13,980
and get him out of town.

421
00:39:13,981 --> 00:39:15,711
Where 17 were found dead.

422
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:20,629
They have no leads, which
means they have no suspects.

423
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:22,713
Everything's fucked up.

424
00:39:24,171 --> 00:39:26,410
We'll figure it out.

425
00:39:26,411 --> 00:39:28,530
How many more children have to be lost,

426
00:39:28,531 --> 00:39:31,591
and have to live in fear that
their school could be next?

427
00:39:31,592 --> 00:39:34,228
We need to get rid of these drugs.

428
00:39:34,229 --> 00:39:36,031
Yeah, what was all that about?

429
00:39:36,032 --> 00:39:38,130
You said we had two
million dollars in cash.

430
00:39:38,131 --> 00:39:40,962
You didn't say anything about no drugs.

431
00:39:40,963 --> 00:39:43,796
Do you think I would lie to you?

432
00:39:44,792 --> 00:39:49,792
It was a surprise to me, just
like it was a surprise to you.

433
00:39:50,251 --> 00:39:52,084
We're past that point.

434
00:39:53,531 --> 00:39:55,781
We need to get rid of them.

435
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:01,344
Now did you set everything up
with your San Fran contact?

436
00:40:01,345 --> 00:40:04,595
Yeah, everything's set up.

437
00:40:06,198 --> 00:40:07,438
Okay.

438
00:40:10,244 --> 00:40:12,123
Now I'm gonna go handle this deal,

439
00:40:12,124 --> 00:40:15,291
and I'll be back in two days.

440
00:40:15,292 --> 00:40:19,292
Meanwhile, you stay
put and out of the way.

441
00:40:20,804 --> 00:40:21,804
You got it?

442
00:40:23,183 --> 00:40:24,183
Hughes.

443
00:40:26,804 --> 00:40:28,054
Do you have it?

444
00:40:30,583 --> 00:40:32,833
Yeah, I got it.

445
00:40:37,381 --> 00:40:38,769
You know anything about
that cop getting killed?

446
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:40,489
Man, I don't know nothing, dog.

447
00:40:40,490 --> 00:40:41,878
You wouldn't be holding
out on me, would you?

448
00:40:41,879 --> 00:40:43,758
Nah, man, these fucking
cuffs is tight, man!

449
00:40:43,759 --> 00:40:45,767
Hey man, shut the fuck
up, who you talking to?

450
00:40:45,768 --> 00:40:47,638
Come on, man, I don't know nothing, man!

451
00:40:47,639 --> 00:40:50,566
If I find out you know
something, I'm gonna hunt you down,

452
00:40:50,567 --> 00:40:52,977
I'm gonna break both your
fucking legs, you got it?

453
00:40:52,978 --> 00:40:55,061
You're gonna be crippled!

454
00:40:57,338 --> 00:40:59,421
Get the fuck out of here.

455
00:41:01,781 --> 00:41:04,114
Fucking kill your black ass.

456
00:41:42,830 --> 00:41:45,309
Hey, what are you doing?

457
00:41:45,310 --> 00:41:47,862
I was just in the area.

458
00:41:47,863 --> 00:41:49,309
Where you going?

459
00:41:49,310 --> 00:41:51,291
On my way home.

460
00:41:51,292 --> 00:41:52,375
Is that so?

461
00:41:54,602 --> 00:41:57,302
There was no money in there.

462
00:41:57,303 --> 00:41:59,136
I don't believe you.

463
00:42:00,482 --> 00:42:02,171
You mean to tell me that
you searched the whole house

464
00:42:02,172 --> 00:42:03,361
and you found nothing?

465
00:42:03,362 --> 00:42:05,029
I didn't say that.

466
00:42:10,402 --> 00:42:11,985
So what you find?

467
00:42:13,590 --> 00:42:17,129
I think you know the
answer to that question.

468
00:42:17,130 --> 00:42:18,888
I think you knew the whole time.

469
00:42:18,889 --> 00:42:20,510
I don't know what you're talking about.

470
00:42:20,511 --> 00:42:24,094
If I would've known,
I wouldn't have asked.

471
00:42:26,442 --> 00:42:29,488
Something I don't like to deal with.

472
00:42:29,489 --> 00:42:30,939
What does that mean?

473
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:34,409
It means I'm a fool for getting
mixed up in this with you.

474
00:42:34,410 --> 00:42:36,481
It means you lied, it means you told me

475
00:42:36,482 --> 00:42:38,499
something was gonna be there that wasn't.

476
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:40,500
I wouldn't lie to you.

477
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:43,060
I swear.

478
00:42:48,608 --> 00:42:50,409
I will see you in a couple of days.

479
00:42:50,410 --> 00:42:54,529
Meet me at the time and
place, as discussed.

480
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:56,113
Okay, okay.

481
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:29,387
What are you doing?

482
00:43:29,388 --> 00:43:30,859
Get the fuck away from me!

483
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:32,379
Hey, get back here!

484
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:34,380
Have you lost your mind?

485
00:44:24,027 --> 00:44:28,027
Me meeting you this
late, better be important.

486
00:44:29,558 --> 00:44:32,141
It is, got a lot of bad news.

487
00:44:34,976 --> 00:44:36,476
What's going on?

488
00:44:37,656 --> 00:44:41,739
One of the houses got
hit, the package is gone.

489
00:44:43,177 --> 00:44:46,177
You got a clue as to who did this?

490
00:44:47,467 --> 00:44:49,967
Not yet, but I'm on it.

491
00:44:52,187 --> 00:44:53,935
We better get on this immediately.

492
00:44:53,936 --> 00:44:57,519
You better get on this immediately.

493
00:45:00,157 --> 00:45:01,240
So what else?

494
00:45:29,283 --> 00:45:30,366
That's all.

495
00:45:31,414 --> 00:45:33,674
Yo, just meet me up there.

496
00:45:33,675 --> 00:45:34,675
Yeah.

497
00:45:37,345 --> 00:45:39,042
I gotta call you back.

498
00:45:39,043 --> 00:45:40,210
What?
Get in.

499
00:45:41,185 --> 00:45:42,518
- What?
- Get in.

500
00:45:44,147 --> 00:45:46,730
Hey, this some bullshit, man.

501
00:46:18,654 --> 00:46:20,487
What you got for me?

502
00:46:22,522 --> 00:46:23,772
Nothing, man.

503
00:46:24,744 --> 00:46:26,543
What you mean, nothing?

504
00:46:26,544 --> 00:46:27,523
You better have something for me,

505
00:46:27,524 --> 00:46:28,714
or I'm gonna take you back to jail.

506
00:46:28,715 --> 00:46:30,115
Man, fuck you.

507
00:46:31,504 --> 00:46:32,914
Yo, man, shit!

508
00:46:32,915 --> 00:46:33,802
You got something for me now?

509
00:46:33,803 --> 00:46:35,743
Yes, yes, yes.

510
00:46:35,744 --> 00:46:37,893
That's what I thought.

511
00:46:37,894 --> 00:46:39,601
Fuck, man.

512
00:46:39,602 --> 00:46:41,670
Hey, I do this shit, you owe me next time.

513
00:46:41,671 --> 00:46:42,671
Uh-huh.

514
00:46:46,551 --> 00:46:51,134
All right, I sold a Glock
to this dude the other day.

515
00:46:52,252 --> 00:46:53,252
And?

516
00:46:55,511 --> 00:46:59,801
Might be the same
weapon used in the murder.

517
00:46:59,802 --> 00:47:01,302
What's his name?

518
00:47:05,042 --> 00:47:06,042
Frank.

519
00:47:07,470 --> 00:47:09,742
Hangs out with this dude named Hughes,

520
00:47:09,743 --> 00:47:12,173
likes to throw parties.

521
00:48:24,934 --> 00:48:26,566
Lady Amina.

522
00:48:26,567 --> 00:48:27,973
Cliff.

523
00:48:27,974 --> 00:48:29,141
Have a seat.

524
00:48:30,855 --> 00:48:33,334
Hey, you all right, man?

525
00:48:33,335 --> 00:48:35,825
You ain't looking too good.

526
00:48:35,826 --> 00:48:38,046
You have a nice home.

527
00:48:38,047 --> 00:48:39,675
It is nice, isn't it?

528
00:48:39,676 --> 00:48:42,814
Not my home, I just have access to things.

529
00:48:42,815 --> 00:48:45,093
You know, with access comes possibilities,

530
00:48:45,094 --> 00:48:47,175
and possibilities are endless.

531
00:48:49,476 --> 00:48:50,476
This guy.

532
00:48:52,066 --> 00:48:53,066
Good.

533
00:48:57,655 --> 00:48:59,214
So can you get more?

534
00:48:59,215 --> 00:49:01,555
No, this is a one time thing.

535
00:49:01,556 --> 00:49:02,926
Where'd you get it?

536
00:49:02,927 --> 00:49:04,087
Let's just say I got lucky.

537
00:49:05,575 --> 00:49:07,325
Well aren't we all?

538
00:49:08,723 --> 00:49:12,882
Well Mr. Cliff, if you so
happen to get lucky again,

539
00:49:12,883 --> 00:49:15,814
there's more where that came from.

540
00:49:15,815 --> 00:49:19,372
With all due respect,
you won't see me again.

541
00:49:19,373 --> 00:49:22,374
Then it's nice doing business with you.

542
00:49:22,375 --> 00:49:23,375
Likewise.

543
00:49:50,521 --> 00:49:51,680
Here you go.

544
00:49:51,681 --> 00:49:54,098
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

545
00:50:04,268 --> 00:50:07,065
So what can I do for you this evening?

546
00:50:07,066 --> 00:50:09,856
I'm looking for your son.

547
00:50:09,857 --> 00:50:11,187
Why?

548
00:50:11,188 --> 00:50:13,336
Need to ask him some questions.

549
00:50:13,337 --> 00:50:15,670
Some questions about what?

550
00:50:17,136 --> 00:50:20,969
About the night Officer
Carter was murdered.

551
00:50:22,169 --> 00:50:23,856
After everything I've been
through with the police,

552
00:50:23,857 --> 00:50:26,478
you have the audacity to come in my home

553
00:50:26,479 --> 00:50:29,118
and ask me where my son is?

554
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:32,118
To question his whereabouts?

555
00:50:32,119 --> 00:50:37,119
I don't know where he is, but
if I did, I wouldn't tell you.

556
00:50:37,456 --> 00:50:40,576
Now you have any more questions?

557
00:50:40,577 --> 00:50:44,244
- No more questions.
- Well there's the door.

558
00:50:46,599 --> 00:50:49,516
- Thank you for the tea.
- Whatever.

559
00:51:14,523 --> 00:51:17,471
I'm surprised to be
getting this call from you.

560
00:51:17,472 --> 00:51:19,421
What can I do for you?

561
00:51:19,422 --> 00:51:20,878
Some luggage of mine's missing,

562
00:51:20,879 --> 00:51:24,879
and I wanna know if you
heard anything about it.

563
00:51:26,771 --> 00:51:29,631
I might've heard something.

564
00:51:29,632 --> 00:51:31,231
Yeah?

565
00:51:31,232 --> 00:51:34,479
Some kid Hughes came and
called one of my employees,

566
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:36,711
and said he had a nice
piece of luggage for sale.

567
00:51:36,712 --> 00:51:39,159
So I sent him to the streets this morning.

568
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:40,631
So something's missing out of my area

569
00:51:40,632 --> 00:51:43,770
and you don't bother to talk to me first?

570
00:51:43,771 --> 00:51:45,271
Honey, this is business,

571
00:51:45,272 --> 00:51:48,599
and you would've did the same thing.

572
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:52,079
The bigger problem is,
you've been holding out.

573
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:54,111
So how about I make you a deal?

574
00:51:54,112 --> 00:51:55,991
You keep it flowing,

575
00:51:55,992 --> 00:51:58,351
and I do you a solid and
give you his address.

576
00:51:58,352 --> 00:51:59,331
Address?

577
00:51:59,332 --> 00:52:00,581
Yes, address.

578
00:52:01,542 --> 00:52:05,998
I keep information on
everyone I do business with.

579
00:52:05,999 --> 00:52:07,719
You got a deal.

580
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:10,387
I'll send you a message later.

581
00:52:41,374 --> 00:52:43,412
How's your night going?

582
00:52:43,413 --> 00:52:44,366
It's a long night, man.

583
00:52:44,367 --> 00:52:46,275
- Yeah, another one?
- I can't call it, yeah.

584
00:52:46,276 --> 00:52:47,364
Can I get that vodka right there?

585
00:52:47,365 --> 00:52:48,198
Which one?

586
00:52:48,199 --> 00:52:49,935
- The original, right there.
- Original?

587
00:52:49,936 --> 00:52:51,204
- Yeah.
- You got it.

588
00:52:51,205 --> 00:52:52,146
Nice.

589
00:52:52,147 --> 00:52:53,804
Your total is 17.83, please.

590
00:52:53,805 --> 00:52:54,638
Cool, man.

591
00:52:54,639 --> 00:52:57,388
Thanks, have a good one, see you.

592
00:53:01,316 --> 00:53:02,399
You Hughes?

593
00:53:03,824 --> 00:53:05,241
Who wanna know?

594
00:53:06,417 --> 00:53:09,526
Detective Cole, need to
ask you some questions.

595
00:53:09,527 --> 00:53:10,646
I'm actually headed somewhere right now.

596
00:53:10,647 --> 00:53:12,897
It's not gonna take long.

597
00:53:15,545 --> 00:53:17,462
Questions about what?

598
00:53:19,745 --> 00:53:23,526
You know where I can
find your friend Frank?

599
00:53:23,527 --> 00:53:26,360
Nah, I don't know where he's at.

600
00:53:29,094 --> 00:53:30,614
I think you're lying.

601
00:53:30,615 --> 00:53:32,494
You can think whatever you wanna think.

602
00:53:32,495 --> 00:53:36,126
Why you wanna know where he's at anyway?

603
00:53:36,127 --> 00:53:40,377
You and me both know the
answer to that question.

604
00:53:44,585 --> 00:53:46,085
That's a nice car.

605
00:53:47,425 --> 00:53:50,886
Mind if I ask what you do for a living?

606
00:53:50,887 --> 00:53:53,304
I'm in real estate.

607
00:53:53,305 --> 00:53:55,093
Real estate, huh?

608
00:53:55,094 --> 00:53:56,177
That's funny.

609
00:53:57,025 --> 00:53:58,025
Yeah.

610
00:53:58,935 --> 00:54:01,102
You got anymore questions?

611
00:54:02,567 --> 00:54:04,035
Nope.

612
00:54:04,036 --> 00:54:07,869
If your friend Frank
shows up, give me a call.

613
00:54:48,486 --> 00:54:49,486
Who is it?

614
00:55:59,188 --> 00:56:00,188
Fuck!

615
00:56:06,097 --> 00:56:10,296
You know what I see
when I look in your eyes?

616
00:56:10,297 --> 00:56:11,297
Fear.

617
00:56:13,337 --> 00:56:18,337
It's not the first time I'm
seeing this look, by the way.

618
00:56:18,857 --> 00:56:21,440
I've seen this look many times.

619
00:56:24,230 --> 00:56:27,530
Now I'm gonna need some
information from you,

620
00:56:27,531 --> 00:56:31,448
so I'm going to ask you a simple question,

621
00:56:33,251 --> 00:56:36,668
and I want a simple answer.

622
00:56:41,011 --> 00:56:44,928
Where is my money?

623
00:56:47,891 --> 00:56:51,058
I don't know what you talking about.

624
00:57:22,668 --> 00:57:23,835
Now tell me.

625
00:57:25,417 --> 00:57:27,750
Where is my money?

626
00:57:30,820 --> 00:57:35,653
Or better yet, tell me
where your friend is.

627
00:57:39,815 --> 00:57:41,315
Who made the trip?

628
00:57:47,819 --> 00:57:52,349
I don't know what the
fuck you talking about.

629
00:57:52,350 --> 00:57:55,850
So you wanna play fucking games with me?

630
00:57:57,491 --> 00:58:01,991
One of your friends sold my shit

631
00:58:03,277 --> 00:58:05,277
to an associate of mine.

632
00:58:11,769 --> 00:58:13,519
You don't wanna talk?

633
00:58:15,899 --> 00:58:16,899
No.

634
00:58:50,386 --> 00:58:52,553
Cliff, it's Frank.

635
00:58:55,573 --> 00:58:57,073
I'm in the valley.

636
00:58:58,279 --> 00:58:59,946
Meet me in the loft.

637
00:59:02,713 --> 00:59:03,713
All right.

638
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:22,057
Look at you.

639
00:59:24,199 --> 00:59:28,116
All this could've been avoided.

640
00:59:29,828 --> 00:59:32,828
Now I'm gonna ask you one more time.

641
00:59:37,677 --> 00:59:41,094
Where is my money?

642
00:59:46,346 --> 00:59:48,929
I told your punk ass already.

643
00:59:50,818 --> 00:59:54,568
I don't know what the
fuck you talking about.

644
01:00:40,748 --> 01:00:42,915
Seen him with your wife.

645
01:01:01,885 --> 01:01:03,302
Where you been?

646
01:01:05,405 --> 01:01:08,405
I've been laying low for a minute.

647
01:01:09,317 --> 01:01:11,084
You spoke to Hughes?

648
01:01:11,085 --> 01:01:12,085
No.

649
01:01:13,405 --> 01:01:15,761
He's not answering.

650
01:01:15,762 --> 01:01:17,764
Did you do the job?

651
01:01:17,765 --> 01:01:18,765
Yeah.

652
01:01:20,196 --> 01:01:22,613
Don't worry, I have your cut.

653
01:01:25,837 --> 01:01:28,920
Why'd you have to fuck everything up?

654
01:01:30,906 --> 01:01:32,823
What were you thinking?

655
01:01:36,525 --> 01:01:39,858
What do you mean, what I was thinking?

656
01:01:40,965 --> 01:01:42,882
I did what I had to do.

657
01:01:44,357 --> 01:01:47,107
I just gotta go away for a while,

658
01:01:49,725 --> 01:01:51,265
'till things blow over.

659
01:01:51,266 --> 01:01:52,735
Until things blow over?

660
01:01:56,044 --> 01:01:59,275
There's no coming back to this.

661
01:01:59,276 --> 01:02:01,276
You lost that privilege.

662
01:02:03,425 --> 01:02:05,342
Your life here is over.

663
01:02:08,116 --> 01:02:09,533
Whatever, then.

664
01:03:06,516 --> 01:03:07,536
Hello?

665
01:03:07,537 --> 01:03:10,347
Found a property under
Hughes White's name.

666
01:03:10,348 --> 01:03:11,765
Okay, where at?

667
01:03:12,836 --> 01:03:16,003
Located at 644 South Springs Street.

668
01:03:20,167 --> 01:03:22,226
Okay, got it.

669
01:03:22,227 --> 01:03:23,395
Great work, Sergeant.

670
01:03:23,396 --> 01:03:24,813
Thank you, sir.

671
01:06:44,398 --> 01:06:45,398
Hey.

672
01:06:48,111 --> 01:06:52,621
What's the matter, baby, I
thought you'd be happy to see me.

673
01:06:52,622 --> 01:06:54,622
I am happy to see you.

674
01:06:57,062 --> 01:07:00,301
Something came up
missing that belongs to me,

675
01:07:00,302 --> 01:07:01,885
and I want it back.

676
01:07:06,120 --> 01:07:08,203
I thought you were loyal.

677
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:12,553
I gave you everything.

678
01:07:14,639 --> 01:07:18,056
You're just like the rest of the bitches.

679
01:07:19,331 --> 01:07:21,370
I'll tell you what.

680
01:07:21,371 --> 01:07:25,704
Dig in that purse of
yours and get your phone,

681
01:07:27,582 --> 01:07:29,332
and call your friend.

682
01:07:32,832 --> 01:07:36,415
Tell him to meet you
at your favorite spot,

683
01:07:39,171 --> 01:07:41,838
and to bring what belongs to me.

684
01:08:00,543 --> 01:08:01,543
Cliff.

685
01:08:03,763 --> 01:08:04,930
Yeah, it's me.

686
01:08:06,072 --> 01:08:07,989
No, everything is fine.

687
01:08:08,824 --> 01:08:10,157
Change of plans.

688
01:08:11,384 --> 01:08:15,384
Can you meet me at the bar on Melrose?

689
01:08:19,244 --> 01:08:21,827
Yeah, any minutes.

690
01:08:26,104 --> 01:08:27,104
Okay.

691
01:08:29,257 --> 01:08:30,257
Bye.

692
01:08:39,753 --> 01:08:42,920
Wow, you're good.

693
01:08:45,903 --> 01:08:48,653
You're really good.

694
01:08:51,975 --> 01:08:54,115
No, no, no, no, I was
gonna tell you everything,

695
01:08:54,116 --> 01:08:58,866
I was gonna tell you every...

696
01:09:14,421 --> 01:09:15,860
Yes, Dave, developing news here

697
01:09:15,861 --> 01:09:18,638
in downtown Los Angeles's
Parkview Apartments.

698
01:09:18,639 --> 01:09:21,149
The victim whose body
was found in unit 504

699
01:09:21,150 --> 01:09:22,438
has now been identified

700
01:09:22,439 --> 01:09:25,110
as 28 year old resident Hughes White.

701
01:09:25,111 --> 01:09:27,129
Authorities are not
releasing further detail,

702
01:09:27,130 --> 01:09:30,190
although they have ruled his
death an apparent homicide.

703
01:09:30,191 --> 01:09:32,438
At this time, there are no suspects.

704
01:09:32,439 --> 01:09:35,606
Jillian Batista for Channel Four News.

705
01:09:48,163 --> 01:09:50,913
Fuck!

706
01:09:52,306 --> 01:09:53,306
Fuck.

707
01:10:12,994 --> 01:10:15,827
Black holes in 20 minute sketch.

708
01:10:18,045 --> 01:10:21,972
Listen, Pete, I'm sick of this shit.

709
01:10:21,973 --> 01:10:26,523
I'm physically ill from
this fucking garbage.

710
01:10:26,524 --> 01:10:28,443
Wanna wack them out.

711
01:10:28,444 --> 01:10:31,853
Hard, slow, and ugly.

712
01:10:34,133 --> 01:10:38,603
The thought of that dirty
nigger fucking my wife

713
01:10:38,604 --> 01:10:41,713
leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

714
01:10:41,714 --> 01:10:45,631
I wanna cut my throat, you understand?

715
01:10:48,364 --> 01:10:50,123
Every time I kissed her,

716
01:10:50,124 --> 01:10:52,844
I felt like I was sucking his filthy,

717
01:10:52,845 --> 01:10:55,678
unwashed monkey cock.

718
01:10:56,656 --> 01:10:57,656
Fuck him!

719
01:10:58,714 --> 01:11:02,297
I gotta go take a leak,
I'll be right back.

720
01:12:04,031 --> 01:12:05,114
Motherfucker!

721
01:12:14,806 --> 01:12:17,696
You nigger motherfucker,
you fucked my wife!

722
01:12:17,697 --> 01:12:18,993
You fucked my woman!

723
01:12:18,994 --> 01:12:20,661
Die, motherfucker.

724
01:14:07,308 --> 01:14:11,800
The closest thing I have
to family are my friends.

725
01:14:11,801 --> 01:14:12,634
You laughing, man,

726
01:14:12,635 --> 01:14:14,235
that's that bullshit, bro.
I love them.

727
01:14:15,275 --> 01:14:16,942
They're my brothers.

728
01:14:19,375 --> 01:14:20,525
We're just at a point

729
01:14:20,526 --> 01:14:24,109
where we all need
different things in life.

730
01:14:26,425 --> 01:14:29,425
We grow, we change,

731
01:14:30,923 --> 01:14:32,774
and we evolve.

732
01:14:39,065 --> 01:14:42,398
As human beings, we have to accept that.
