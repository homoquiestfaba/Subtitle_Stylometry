No one is trying

I can assure you
the air force is

- Oh.

174
00:13:56,671 --> 00:13:59,440
Tom, something was
disturbing him.

175
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:05,913
I know
this sounds crazy,

176
00:14:05,946 --> 00:14:10,351
but I think that somebody
did something to him.

177
00:14:10,384 --> 00:14:11,619
What do you mean?

178
00:14:11,653 --> 00:14:13,387
He never had
any trouble sleeping

179
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:14,988
and then all of a sudden

180
00:14:15,022 --> 00:14:16,890
he started having
this reoccurring nightmare.

181
00:14:16,924 --> 00:14:20,494
He'd wake up in the middle
of the night screaming.

182
00:14:20,528 --> 00:14:23,163
But everybody has
bad dreams.

183
00:14:24,599 --> 00:14:26,967
These were different.

184
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:38,546

- Good.

187
00:14:52,727 --> 00:14:55,996
- Sit still.

been answered, cowboy.

Aw shit.

00:19:12,219 --> 00:19:14,656
Colonel, he doesn't
seem to be responding
to the increased dosage.

<i>He seems to have</i>
<i>an unusually high resistance.</i>

<i>( Traffic sounds )</i>

237
00:19:25,499 --> 00:19:29,504

238
00:19:29,537 --> 00:19:31,171
It's sticking.

239
00:19:34,274 --> 00:19:36,243
That sounds
very nice, dear.

240
00:19:38,946 --> 00:19:41,649
Any color you want's
fine with me.

241
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:45,586
All right.
I'll see you tonight.

242

May's redoing the kitchen.

She's been asking
since 1967.

244
00:19:54,261 --> 00:19:55,830

<i>I have something</i>
<i>I want you to hear.</i>

<i>Glen, listen to this.</i>

247
00:20:01,669 --> 00:20:03,838
"In an enthusiastic
assessment

248
00:20:03,871 --> 00:20:06,373
of his plan to scale down
the armed forces,

249
00:20:06,406 --> 00:20:08,843
defense secretary
Spencer said,

250
00:20:08,876 --> 00:20:10,678
'it will signal
to the rest of the world

251
00:20:10,712 --> 00:20:12,479
that the cold war is over

252
00:20:12,513 --> 00:20:15,016
and it's time to invest
scarce resources

253
00:20:15,049 --> 00:20:17,885
in building a better life
for average citizens.'"

254
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:20,021
amazing, isn't it?

255
00:20:20,054 --> 00:20:24,926
Do they realize
that defense has driven
this economy since f.D.R.?

256
00:20:26,426 --> 00:20:28,428
Pendulum always
swings back, Glen,

257
00:20:28,462 --> 00:20:31,966
which is why our work is
even more important now.

258
00:20:31,999 --> 00:20:33,333
How's the program going?

259
00:20:33,366 --> 00:20:35,803
Riley and Tate are
responding well.

260
00:20:35,837 --> 00:20:37,404
And waters?

261
00:20:38,673 --> 00:20:42,877
He appears to have
an innate resistance.

262
00:20:43,911 --> 00:20:46,346
Maybe you should drop him.

263
00:20:46,379 --> 00:20:49,684
I'm confident it's just
a matter of finding
the right dosage.

264
00:20:49,717 --> 00:20:53,821
You were also confident
you could control
captain Matthews.

265
00:20:53,855 --> 00:20:56,057
What did they call him?

266
00:20:56,090 --> 00:20:58,960
- <i>Hound dog. </i>
- Hound dog!
That's right.

267
00:20:58,993 --> 00:21:01,829
I still get a kick out
of those names.

268
00:21:01,863 --> 00:21:04,397
It's a terrible tragedy,
though.

269
00:21:04,431 --> 00:21:06,266
He has a lovely wife.

270
00:21:07,802 --> 00:21:09,369
Well, Glen,
it's your program,

271
00:21:09,402 --> 00:21:11,304
so it's your call.

272
00:21:11,338 --> 00:21:12,940
You do what
you want with waters.

273
00:21:12,974 --> 00:21:17,344
Just remember there's
no room for a wild card
in this program.

274
00:21:17,377 --> 00:21:20,413
Don't worry about waters.
I can handle him.

275
00:21:22,349 --> 00:21:23,818
It's breslaw
I'm worried about.

276
00:21:24,852 --> 00:21:26,888
You just handle
the captain.

you can get me one

It ain't
the flight suit, Joe.

broccoli and cheese,

Yeah, well, I guess--

00:23:24,839 --> 00:23:27,541
I guess it lost a little
in the translation.

312
00:23:27,575 --> 00:23:29,710
I think so.

313
00:23:29,744 --> 00:23:31,712
Why don't you
translate this?

314
00:23:31,746 --> 00:23:33,748
I don't cook.

315
00:23:35,516 --> 00:23:39,687
Well, maybe you'll find
someone who does.

Hey, captain.

317
00:23:47,228 --> 00:23:49,462

Besides, it's a good way

So what's it like?

328

What's what like?

329
00:24:28,536 --> 00:24:31,172
Flying.
Flying jets.

If I did,

337
00:24:57,064 --> 00:24:58,866
I'd have to kill you.

Not really.
What do you do?

340

Mmm.

00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:26,961
So what would you do

345
00:25:28,896 --> 00:25:30,865
I don't know.

Oh, come on,
there's got to be something.

347
00:25:37,171 --> 00:25:39,840
I'd drive cross-country--

348
00:25:39,874 --> 00:25:41,642
no map,

349
00:25:42,676 --> 00:25:44,145
no destination.

350
00:25:45,246 --> 00:25:47,281
Just see where
the road takes me.

351
00:25:49,383 --> 00:25:51,585
That could be
a lonely drive.

352
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:57,491
Huh.

353
00:25:57,526 --> 00:26:00,895
- ( Both breathing heavily )
- ( Jazz music playing )

354
00:26:04,765 --> 00:26:06,834
Mmm.

355
00:26:07,902 --> 00:26:10,137
I'm sorry.
It's just a little fast.

356
00:26:11,305 --> 00:26:12,973
Ah.

357
00:26:16,911 --> 00:26:19,980
- ( Chuckles )
- Should I go?

358
00:26:23,317 --> 00:26:24,885
No.

359
00:26:27,054 --> 00:26:29,957
I just think you've had
too much to drink, you know?

360
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:31,692
You shouldn't drive home.

361
00:26:33,694 --> 00:26:35,763
Why don't you stay
on the couch?

362
00:26:37,198 --> 00:26:39,633
I got a better idea.

363
00:26:39,667 --> 00:26:43,003
Why don't I sleep
in your bed...

377
00:27:58,312 --> 00:27:59,780
I mean,
it's just a bad dream.

378

No.

I don't think
we should.

386
00:29:00,941 --> 00:29:03,210

397
00:30:52,687 --> 00:30:54,922
About a month

398

before the accident.

399
00:30:57,958 --> 00:31:00,394
Did he describe them
to you?

400
00:31:02,697 --> 00:31:04,532
Not really.

401
00:31:06,233 --> 00:31:08,369
I asked, but...
( Chuckles )

402
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:12,906
He didn't want me to see
that he was worried.

403

Do you think
maybe I could

404

take a look
around his office?

405
00:31:22,216 --> 00:31:23,984

it would help.

Yeah.

This doesn't sound

He was not

00:42:42,663 --> 00:42:44,031
No target in sight.

00:42:56,077 --> 00:42:59,046
<i>Missiles armed.</i>
<i>Still no target.</i>

522
00:43:01,315 --> 00:43:03,784
Boost his
v.R. Power level to 8.

523
00:43:03,818 --> 00:43:06,087
- Level 8?
- Yeah.

524
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:08,689
- Yeah, do it.
- Yes sir.

525
00:43:09,924 --> 00:43:11,926
( Beeping )

526
00:43:13,661 --> 00:43:15,763
Tom:
<i>I see it.</i>
<i>Target acquired.</i>

527
00:43:15,796 --> 00:43:17,298
( Lasers firing )

528
00:43:17,331 --> 00:43:19,100
Tom:
<i>I'm also getting</i>
<i>ground fire.</i>

529
00:43:19,133 --> 00:43:21,969
Starting
evasive maneuvers.

530
00:43:26,874 --> 00:43:28,409
I'll put it through
the front door.

531
00:43:28,442 --> 00:43:31,679
- ( Beeps )
- Missile away.

532
00:43:41,989 --> 00:43:43,824
Bull's-eye!

533
00:43:43,858 --> 00:43:46,760
Perfect visual
substitution.

534
00:43:46,794 --> 00:43:49,663
Cowboy,
you're up next.

535
00:43:50,764 --> 00:43:52,199
Yes sir.

536
00:43:52,233 --> 00:43:54,835
Activate
default program #2.

537
00:43:54,869 --> 00:43:58,339
Default v.R. System
program #2

538
00:43:58,372 --> 00:43:59,740
is activated, sir.

539
00:43:59,773 --> 00:44:01,775
( Beeping )

540
00:44:03,911 --> 00:44:06,447
( Flatly )
Echo 2 waiting
for instructions.

541
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:09,250
Take up heading 0-5-7,

542
00:44:09,283 --> 00:44:12,353
ascend to angels-1
and start your run.

543
00:44:12,386 --> 00:44:15,055
Roger, control.
I'm starting my run.

544
00:44:17,458 --> 00:44:19,160
Hey, cowboy,
where you going?

545
00:44:19,193 --> 00:44:20,861
The target range is
over here.

546
00:44:27,501 --> 00:44:29,737
Hey, cowboy,
you want to clue me in?

547
00:44:29,770 --> 00:44:31,772
- ( Beeping )
- Tom: <i>Cowboy!</i>

548
00:44:36,511 --> 00:44:39,780
- ( Beeping )
- He's on the new
course, colonel.

549
00:44:39,813 --> 00:44:42,416
Echo 2, echo 2,
radio check. Come in,

550
00:44:43,784 --> 00:44:46,453
- ( pinging )
- <i>Where are you?</i>

551
00:44:46,487 --> 00:44:49,323
Cowboy, this is outlaw.
Come in.

552
00:44:50,991 --> 00:44:53,827
Pike control,
I lost cowboy.

553
00:44:53,861 --> 00:44:55,729
I'm making
a turn to the north.

554
00:44:55,763 --> 00:44:58,732
Echo 1,
maintain current heading.

555
00:44:58,766 --> 00:45:00,467
Tom:
Colonel, there's something
wrong with cowboy.

556
00:45:00,501 --> 00:45:02,770
He's still not responding
to my radio calls.

557
00:45:02,803 --> 00:45:05,806
Glen:
<i>Captain, we're handling</i>
<i>the situation from down here.</i>

558
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:08,742
Hold your original heading.
That's an order.

559
00:45:08,776 --> 00:45:10,077
Yes sir.

560
00:45:10,110 --> 00:45:11,712
( Flatly )
Echo 2.

561
00:45:13,881 --> 00:45:15,149
Approaching
checkpoint tango.

562
00:45:15,182 --> 00:45:17,718
Call back when you get
a visual on the target.

563
00:45:22,356 --> 00:45:25,025
( Laughs )

564
00:45:25,059 --> 00:45:26,794
Mm-hmm.

565
00:45:28,095 --> 00:45:29,897
- Huh.
- Man over radio: <i>Webster.</i>

566
00:45:29,930 --> 00:45:31,932
<i>This is Taylor.</i>
<i>Come in.</i>

567
00:45:31,966 --> 00:45:33,434
Ah!

568
00:45:37,137 --> 00:45:38,806
Uh-huh. Mmm.

569
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:42,309
( Clears throat )
Webster here. What's up?

570
00:45:42,343 --> 00:45:43,911
<i>Hey, buddy,</i>
<i>where are you?</i>

571
00:45:43,944 --> 00:45:46,313
Another air force test.

572
00:45:46,347 --> 00:45:48,983
I got route 234 closed
to all traffic.

573
00:45:49,016 --> 00:45:51,018
It's a thrill a minute.

574
00:45:51,051 --> 00:45:54,121
<i>I'm at marker 13,</i>
<i>but I don't see you.</i>

575
00:45:54,154 --> 00:45:57,424
That's 'cause
I'm at mile marker 30.

576
00:45:57,458 --> 00:46:00,562
<i>You're supposed to be</i>
<i>at 13, Einstein.</i>

577
00:46:00,595 --> 00:46:02,896
No, uh...

578
00:46:02,930 --> 00:46:04,865
Oh shit.

579
00:46:05,966 --> 00:46:08,902
Uh, hold on.

580
00:46:09,970 --> 00:46:12,273
( Radar gun beeping )

581
00:46:12,306 --> 00:46:13,907
What the hell?

582
00:46:16,910 --> 00:46:18,279
( Mutters )

583
00:46:25,953 --> 00:46:27,788
( Beeps )

584
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:41,835
- ( Mutters )
- <i>( Sonic boom )</i>

585
00:46:41,869 --> 00:46:42,903
Oh!

586
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:49,910
Oh! Jesus Christ.

587
00:46:51,345 --> 00:46:53,914
I have visual,
pike control.

588
00:46:53,947 --> 00:46:55,550
Target is
an armored vehicle.

589
00:46:55,583 --> 00:46:57,184
Stand by, echo 2.

590
00:46:58,252 --> 00:47:00,421
Sir, the satellite image
is coming in.

591
00:47:00,454 --> 00:47:03,090
- ( Beeps )
- It's hard to make out.

592
00:47:04,325 --> 00:47:05,893
That looks like it.

593
00:47:07,494 --> 00:47:08,896
( Beeping )

594
00:47:08,929 --> 00:47:10,964
Pike control
to echo 2.

595
00:47:10,998 --> 00:47:13,434
Your objective is
to destroy the vehicle.

596
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:20,341
Oh Jesus.

597
00:47:22,009 --> 00:47:23,977
( Flatly )
Good target acquisition.

598
00:47:28,916 --> 00:47:31,485
Colonel,
this can't be right.
The coordinates are off.

599
00:47:31,519 --> 00:47:33,354
Enhance this
satellite image.

600
00:47:35,690 --> 00:47:37,925
Hurry up.

601
00:47:37,958 --> 00:47:39,293
That's a police cruiser.

602
00:47:39,326 --> 00:47:41,929
( Breathing heavily )

603
00:47:41,962 --> 00:47:44,599
- ( Beeps )
- Missile away.

604
00:47:50,304 --> 00:47:53,006
( Pants )

605
00:48:14,995 --> 00:48:17,197
What's he doing now?

606
00:48:17,231 --> 00:48:20,033
- ( Beeping )
- His v.R. Power level
is too high.

607
00:48:20,067 --> 00:48:21,402
Get it back to normal.

608
00:48:23,303 --> 00:48:25,305
( Breathing heavily )

609
00:48:33,981 --> 00:48:35,617
( Beeping )

610
00:48:37,451 --> 00:48:39,052
That's a person running.

611
00:48:42,122 --> 00:48:45,292
Echo 2 acquiring
secondary target.

612
00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:48,128
Son of a...

613
00:48:53,568 --> 00:48:56,638
Echo 2, you have
the wrong target, damn it!

614
00:48:56,671 --> 00:48:58,338
The wrong target!

615
00:49:03,076 --> 00:49:05,145
( Grunts )

616
00:49:13,086 --> 00:49:15,590
Cowboy:
Target destroyed.

617
00:49:15,623 --> 00:49:17,157
<i>Returning</i>
<i>control point Charlie.</i>

618
00:49:17,191 --> 00:49:18,593
<i>Echo 2 out.</i>

619
00:49:18,626 --> 00:49:20,628
- <i>( Radio chatter ) </i>
- <i>( Phone ringing )</i>

620
00:49:23,765 --> 00:49:25,567
What the hell happened?

621
00:49:28,536 --> 00:49:31,004
Colonel Anderson,
the target vehicle
was never hit.

622
00:49:31,038 --> 00:49:33,575
It was a mile away
from the vehicle
echo 2 attacked.

623
00:49:56,631 --> 00:49:58,600
( Beeping )

624
00:49:58,633 --> 00:50:01,435
( Breathes heavily )

625
00:50:01,468 --> 00:50:03,470
( Grunting )

626
00:50:10,143 --> 00:50:12,045
What's code 7700?

627
00:50:16,551 --> 00:50:19,152
Where are you, cowboy?
Where are you?

628
00:50:21,088 --> 00:50:22,524
Got him at 3:00.

629
00:50:22,557 --> 00:50:24,191
Cowboy, come in.

630
00:50:27,094 --> 00:50:30,632
Echo 1,
echo 2 is not responding.

631
00:50:34,434 --> 00:50:36,571
Cowboy,
this is outlaw.

632
00:50:36,604 --> 00:50:38,706
I'm coming up
on your right wing.

633
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:43,110
Cowboy, come on,
respond. Answer me.

634
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:48,282
( Whirring, beeping )

635
00:50:50,183 --> 00:50:52,119
Tom:
<i>Man, what the hell</i>
<i>are you doing?</i>

636
00:50:54,656 --> 00:50:56,524
Man:
<i>Colonel, that's a gun.</i>

637
00:50:56,558 --> 00:50:58,225
Tom:
<i>Put the gun away, cowboy!</i>

638
00:50:58,258 --> 00:51:00,728
<i>Come on!</i>
<i>Talk to me, cowboy!</i>

639
00:51:00,762 --> 00:51:03,631
Cowboy, listen to me!

640
00:51:03,665 --> 00:51:05,567
- Cowboy!
- <i>( Gunshot )</i>

641
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:07,367
<i>Damn it, cowboy,</i>
<i>talk to me!</i>

642
00:51:07,401 --> 00:51:09,169
<i>Come on!</i>
<i>Come on, man!</i>

643
00:51:09,202 --> 00:51:10,772
<i>Stay with it!</i>
<i>Stay with it!</i>

644
00:51:10,805 --> 00:51:12,139
<i>Come on,</i>
<i>pull it together!</i>

645
00:51:12,172 --> 00:51:14,174
Get it back!
Get it back!

646
00:51:19,346 --> 00:51:22,817
- He's going down.
- Tom: <i>Bail out!</i>

647
00:51:22,850 --> 00:51:24,719
<i>Bail out, damn it!</i>
<i>Bail out!</i>

648
00:51:35,228 --> 00:51:37,230
I want to remind everybody

649
00:51:37,264 --> 00:51:40,133
that this operation
is black.

650
00:51:40,167 --> 00:51:43,203
<i>Security is</i>
<i>of the highest priority.</i>

651
00:51:43,236 --> 00:51:46,708
All inquiries
will be referred to me.

652
00:51:48,610 --> 00:51:50,110
Is that clear?

653
00:51:55,449 --> 00:51:57,184
Drugs?

654
00:51:58,953 --> 00:52:01,355
Can you think of any other
rational explanation?

655
00:52:01,388 --> 00:52:04,157
I knew cowboy
better than anybody.

656
00:52:04,191 --> 00:52:06,193
He didn't do drugs.

657
00:52:06,226 --> 00:52:08,529
People aren't always
what they seem, Tom.

658
00:52:08,563 --> 00:52:12,499
Perhaps you didn't know
captain Riley as well
as you thought.

659
00:52:12,533 --> 00:52:14,869
He didn't do drugs

660
00:52:14,902 --> 00:52:17,270
and he wasn't suicidal.

661
00:52:17,304 --> 00:52:19,306
He was reckless.

662
00:52:20,675 --> 00:52:23,210
You saw how he flew during
the v.R. Session yesterday.

663
00:52:23,243 --> 00:52:25,680
- Like hound dog.
- Yes.

664
00:52:25,713 --> 00:52:28,181
Cowboy wasn't
like hound dog.

665
00:52:28,215 --> 00:52:30,183
Look, captain,

666
00:52:30,952 --> 00:52:33,186
I know this is hard
for you to accept.

667
00:52:33,220 --> 00:52:35,590
Sure, colonel.
The v.R. Worked great.

668
00:52:35,623 --> 00:52:38,559
The program's going fine.

669
00:52:38,593 --> 00:52:41,194
Just one minor
little problem--

670
00:52:41,228 --> 00:52:44,565
you've lost two pilots.
No need to get excited.

671
00:52:44,599 --> 00:52:46,668
What the hell are you
trying to say, captain?

672
00:52:46,701 --> 00:52:48,235
I think
you know, colonel.

673
00:52:48,268 --> 00:52:51,438
No, I don't.
Why don't you tell me?

674
00:52:53,473 --> 00:52:55,242
Say it!

675
00:52:55,275 --> 00:52:57,210
No need to get
emotional, gentlemen.

676
00:52:57,244 --> 00:52:59,514
We're all
on the same side here.

677
00:53:00,682 --> 00:53:02,315
Colonel,

678
00:53:03,518 --> 00:53:06,219
why don't you
give me a moment
with captain waters?

679
00:53:17,297 --> 00:53:20,902
( Door opens, closes )

680
00:53:20,935 --> 00:53:23,336
What was that about, Tom?

681
00:53:23,370 --> 00:53:24,872
I don't want to lose
any more of my boys.

682
00:53:24,906 --> 00:53:26,373
Do you know something
that I don't?

683
00:53:26,406 --> 00:53:28,876
It's a gut feeling,

684
00:53:28,910 --> 00:53:31,278
but I think
Anderson might be
covering something up.

685
00:53:31,311 --> 00:53:34,582
- Like what?
- I'm not sure.

686
00:53:34,615 --> 00:53:37,018
I trust
your instincts, Tom.

687
00:53:37,051 --> 00:53:39,486
I want you to come
to my office tomorrow.

688
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:41,321
We will further
this discussion.

689
00:53:41,354 --> 00:53:44,324
But right now, I want
you to go home and have
a couple of drinks.

690
00:53:44,357 --> 00:53:46,460
That's an order.

691
00:53:46,493 --> 00:53:48,295
Yes sir.

692
00:53:52,934 --> 00:53:54,936
( Phone ringing )

693
00:53:59,574 --> 00:54:03,376
- Anderson.

I'm afraid
I have some bad news.

695

We're taking you
off the project.

696
00:54:09,550 --> 00:54:13,788
But there was
a police cruiser
at the target site.

697
00:54:13,821 --> 00:54:16,289
There was no way
to anticipate it.

698
00:54:16,323 --> 00:54:19,060
Glen, it's a black project.

699
00:54:19,093 --> 00:54:22,329
No one will ever
know anything about
what happened out there.

700
00:54:22,362 --> 00:54:23,564
I promise you.

701
00:54:24,732 --> 00:54:27,969
You can't do that.
You need me.

702
00:54:28,002 --> 00:54:30,671
I'm sorry, Glen.

703
00:54:30,705 --> 00:54:32,840
There's nothing I can do.

704
00:54:32,874 --> 00:54:34,809
It's out of my hands.

do an investigation

<i>( Softly ) Yeah.</i>

00:55:15,650 --> 00:55:20,453
I'm gonna be there
to see Anderson
take the blame.

00:55:22,123 --> 00:55:24,424
What? You think--
you think Anderson
killed cowboy?

712
00:55:24,457 --> 00:55:26,594
I know
he killed cowboy,

713
00:55:26,627 --> 00:55:29,396

gonna know it too.

714
00:55:29,429 --> 00:55:30,865

see him tomorrow.

<i>when there's a tragedy,</i>

717
00:55:35,468 --> 00:55:38,973
it's natural to look
for somebody to blame.

718
00:55:40,407 --> 00:55:42,677
But sometimes
there just isn't anybody.

719

that colonel Anderson was
murdered at approximately
2300 hours this evening.

have been conducting

you killed him.

01:10:51,986 --> 01:10:53,921
- <i>Now get out</i>
<i>of the damn plane. </i>
- ( Beeping )

869
01:10:54,956 --> 01:10:56,657
Missile away.

870
01:10:58,626 --> 01:11:00,595
Do you hear me?
Get out, flash!
Bail out!

871
01:11:00,628 --> 01:11:03,330
- ( Hisses )
- Tom: <i>Bail out!</i>

872
01:11:05,867 --> 01:11:08,669
( Beeps, buzzing )

873
01:11:08,703 --> 01:11:10,671
God damn it.

874
01:11:15,442 --> 01:11:18,579
- Get rescue on the horn.
Did you find anything?
- ( Alarm beeping )

875
01:11:18,613 --> 01:11:21,949
Just this--
something about
classified codes.

876
01:11:23,383 --> 01:11:26,687
Flight control,
Amber 1 has gone renegade.

877
01:11:26,721 --> 01:11:29,524
He's a threat to all
aircraft in the area.

878
01:11:30,925 --> 01:11:32,425
Damn you, general.
You're the one

879
01:11:32,459 --> 01:11:34,494
who's out of control,
you lying son of a bitch.

880
01:11:37,430 --> 01:11:40,568
- General?
- What's the location
of rainmaker?

881
01:11:40,601 --> 01:11:44,404
He's skirting
the southern boundary, sir.

882
01:11:44,437 --> 01:11:45,673
Control,
this is outlaw.

883
01:11:45,706 --> 01:11:47,440
There's a woman
being held in security.

884
01:11:47,474 --> 01:11:50,377
- Her name is Caitlin Cole.
- Ignore that, control.

885
01:11:50,410 --> 01:11:53,915
- <i>( Beeps ) </i>
- Tom: <i>She was working</i>
<i>for colonel Anderson.</i>

886
01:11:53,948 --> 01:11:55,917
( Beeping )

887
01:11:55,950 --> 01:11:58,418
She can tell you
everything.

888
01:11:58,451 --> 01:12:00,655
Give in, Tom. Relax.

889
01:12:00,688 --> 01:12:02,489
You can do it.
It's your duty.

890
01:12:02,523 --> 01:12:04,559
( Flatly )
Yes sir.

891
01:12:04,592 --> 01:12:07,695
Good, Tom.
You're about
to make history.

892
01:12:07,728 --> 01:12:09,864
What's he saying?

893
01:12:09,897 --> 01:12:12,633
- ( Keyboard clacks )
- Warlord 1, this is control.

894
01:12:12,667 --> 01:12:14,334
Could you repeat? Over.

895
01:12:18,438 --> 01:12:21,474
- ( Beeps )
- I need a target, general.

896
01:12:21,509 --> 01:12:23,945
Breslaw:
<i>Turn to heading 1-5-7.</i>

897
01:12:23,978 --> 01:12:26,514
1-5-7. Roger.

898
01:12:30,017 --> 01:12:32,653
General-- sir,
that's rainmaker's location.

899
01:12:34,655 --> 01:12:36,524
General?

900
01:12:36,557 --> 01:12:38,659
General,
this is pike control.

901
01:12:38,693 --> 01:12:40,528
Come in. Over.

902
01:12:41,529 --> 01:12:42,797
Damn it.

903
01:12:42,830 --> 01:12:45,766
Call security,
find out if they're
holding a Caitlin Cole.

904
01:12:45,800 --> 01:12:47,500
If they are,
get her up here.

905
01:12:56,844 --> 01:12:58,813
<i>Rainmaker,</i>
<i>this is pike control</i>

906
01:12:58,846 --> 01:13:01,414
<i>with a high-priority warning.</i>
<i>Come in.</i>

907
01:13:01,448 --> 01:13:03,450
Rainmaker:
Pike control,
this is rainmaker.

908
01:13:03,483 --> 01:13:05,119
Go ahead.

909
01:13:05,152 --> 01:13:08,589
Approaching renegade f-16
with hostile intent

910
01:13:08,623 --> 01:13:10,457
being pursued
by a mirage fighter.

911
01:13:10,490 --> 01:13:12,526
Take evasive action now.

912
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:16,564
Against an f-16?
This is a Learjet.

913
01:13:16,597 --> 01:13:20,500
You do understand we have
a high-priority passenger
onboard this aircraft?

914
01:13:21,936 --> 01:13:23,671
Uh, yes sir, I do.

915
01:13:23,704 --> 01:13:26,173
<i>Okay, control.</i>
<i>What's the distance</i>
<i>on that f-16?</i>

916
01:13:26,207 --> 01:13:29,744
25 miles and closing
on full burner.

917
01:14:02,710 --> 01:14:05,746
Control,
he's gaining on US.

918
01:14:08,582 --> 01:14:11,118
Sergeant, here's the woman
you were asking for.

919
01:14:11,152 --> 01:14:13,521
What do
you want, sergeant?

920
01:14:13,554 --> 01:14:16,123
We've got a hell
of a situation here, ma'am.

921
01:14:17,291 --> 01:14:20,728
Captain waters shot down
captain Tate.

922
01:14:20,761 --> 01:14:23,496
He said he was attacked
on orders from the general.

923
01:14:23,531 --> 01:14:25,700
He said you might know
something about it.

924
01:14:28,169 --> 01:14:30,071
Captain waters is
probably right.

925
01:14:30,104 --> 01:14:32,573
Could it have something
to do with these codes?

926
01:14:32,606 --> 01:14:34,275
What codes?

927
01:14:34,308 --> 01:14:37,178
They come up each time
before the attacks.

928
01:14:37,211 --> 01:14:39,580
I can't override them
and I can't break in.

929
01:14:39,613 --> 01:14:41,782
- I can.
- <i>( Handcuffs clink )</i>

930
01:14:41,816 --> 01:14:43,250
Do it, soldier.

931
01:14:48,289 --> 01:14:50,591
- Are you in contact
with captain waters?
- Sporadic.

932
01:14:50,624 --> 01:14:52,994
- Get him.
- ( Keyboard clacking )

933
01:14:53,027 --> 01:14:55,029
Amber 1, this is
pike control. Over.

934
01:14:57,231 --> 01:15:00,768
Amber 1,
this is pike control.
Please acknowledge.

935
01:15:00,801 --> 01:15:02,803
Rainmaker:
We're not gonna
last much longer.

936
01:15:10,144 --> 01:15:11,879
( Beeping )

937
01:15:17,351 --> 01:15:19,920
It's just like
the simulator, Tom.

938
01:15:19,954 --> 01:15:23,724
- There's no difference.
- I'm-- I'm losing
lock on him.

939
01:15:33,334 --> 01:15:38,005
Tom, the time has come
to send a message
to the secretary.

940
01:15:38,039 --> 01:15:40,107
What's he talking about?

941
01:15:40,141 --> 01:15:42,810
- Who's on that other plane?
- The secretary of defense.

942
01:15:44,712 --> 01:15:46,547
He's trying to kill
the secretary.

943
01:15:47,615 --> 01:15:48,649
Jesus.

944
01:15:50,317 --> 01:15:52,853
<i>( Caitlin, distorted )</i>
<i>Tom, can you hear me?</i>

945
01:15:53,988 --> 01:15:55,856
<i>Tom, answer me.</i>

946
01:15:57,892 --> 01:15:59,827
<i>Tom.</i>

947
01:16:00,861 --> 01:16:02,696
<i>Tom!</i>

948
01:16:04,098 --> 01:16:06,067
Tom, this is Caitlin.
If you can hear me,

949
01:16:06,100 --> 01:16:07,368
please acknowledge.

950
01:16:07,401 --> 01:16:09,703
Carry out
your orders, Tom.

951
01:16:17,111 --> 01:16:19,046
- I just about have it.
- ( Beeps )

952
01:16:20,414 --> 01:16:22,683
( Breathing heavily )

953
01:16:29,790 --> 01:16:31,725
- <i>( Beeps ) </i>
- I'm in.

954
01:16:38,365 --> 01:16:41,368
Oh my god.
Tom, listen to me.

955
01:16:41,402 --> 01:16:44,672
The number's a code--
it's a brainwashing code.

956
01:16:44,705 --> 01:16:47,675
Tom, it doesn't matter.
This is something
we have to do.

957
01:16:47,708 --> 01:16:50,211
Caitlin:
<i>You were right, Tom.</i>
<i>There is something going on.</i>

958
01:16:50,244 --> 01:16:52,046
<i>You're being</i>
<i>programmed by breslaw</i>

959
01:16:52,079 --> 01:16:55,015
<i>and you're on</i>
<i>a collision course with</i>
<i>the secretary of defense.</i>

960
01:16:58,419 --> 01:17:00,688
You've gotta pull up, Tom.
You've gotta pull up.

961
01:17:00,721 --> 01:17:03,390
- Stay on target!
- Tom, please pull up!

962
01:17:11,799 --> 01:17:14,902
- <i>( Panicked breathing ) </i>
- Caitlin: <i>Stop your attack,</i>
<i>Tom. Pull up!</i>

963
01:17:19,940 --> 01:17:21,675
No!

964
01:17:22,943 --> 01:17:26,046
Damn it. I am very
disappointed in you, Tom.

965
01:17:28,249 --> 01:17:32,119
- ( Sighs )
- Rainmaker: <i>Okay, control,</i>
<i>this is rainmaker.</i>

966
01:17:32,153 --> 01:17:34,421
<i>Get US out of here now.</i>

967
01:17:34,455 --> 01:17:37,224
- ( Clicks )
- Rainmaker,
this is pike control.

968
01:17:37,258 --> 01:17:40,761
Proceed
to coordinates 2-9-2.

969
01:17:40,794 --> 01:17:42,830
- Sergeant?
- Sergeant: <i>Stand by, rainmaker.</i>

970
01:17:42,863 --> 01:17:46,400
- What is it?
- I have warlord on tactical
intercept with rainmaker.

971
01:17:47,968 --> 01:17:51,038
Shit! General,
what are you doing?

972
01:17:51,071 --> 01:17:54,108
Keeping america strong, son.

973
01:17:54,141 --> 01:17:56,710
<i>I can't allow any one man</i>
<i>to compromise that.</i>

974
01:17:56,744 --> 01:17:58,946
Oh my god.

975
01:17:58,979 --> 01:18:01,081
You'd better alert
base command.

976
01:18:02,850 --> 01:18:06,921
( Clears throat )
Rainmaker, this is
pike control on guard.

977
01:18:06,954 --> 01:18:10,824
Warning, warning,
approaching mirage fighter
with hostile intent.

978
01:18:10,858 --> 01:18:13,460
- <i>Acknowledge. Over. </i>
- Rainmaker: Now it's a mirage?

979
01:18:13,494 --> 01:18:15,796
What the hell are you idiots
doing down there?

980
01:18:18,966 --> 01:18:20,602
<i>Outlaw, this is</i>
<i>pike control.</i>

981
01:18:20,635 --> 01:18:24,104
<i>General breslaw is on</i>
<i>an intercept course with </i>
<i>the secretary of defense.</i>

982
01:18:24,138 --> 01:18:25,839
Acknowledge. Over.

983
01:18:27,808 --> 01:18:29,476
Acknowledge, outlaw. Over.

984
01:18:29,511 --> 01:18:31,378
<i>Do you read, over?</i>

985
01:18:32,413 --> 01:18:33,881
Tom, this is Caitlin.

986
01:18:33,914 --> 01:18:36,518
If you hear me,
please respond.

987
01:18:36,551 --> 01:18:39,053
Cai-- Caitlin?

988
01:18:42,089 --> 01:18:44,225
Turn off Tom's v.R.

989
01:18:44,258 --> 01:18:45,759
- Sergeant: <i>What? </i>
- Turn it off!

990
01:18:50,497 --> 01:18:53,100
Tom, it's Caitlin,
can you hear me?

991
01:18:53,133 --> 01:18:57,271
- Tom: <i>Yeah. </i>
- Warlord at 20 nautical
miles and closing

992
01:19:02,876 --> 01:19:04,945
Tom, you have to
get to breslaw.

993
01:19:04,979 --> 01:19:07,047
He's trying to kill
secretary Spencer.

994
01:19:07,081 --> 01:19:09,517
Do you remember
what just happened?

995
01:19:09,551 --> 01:19:11,352
Umm...

996
01:19:11,385 --> 01:19:13,220
Flash attacked me.

997
01:19:13,254 --> 01:19:15,557
I shot him down.

998
01:19:15,590 --> 01:19:17,525
That's right.
That's right.

999
01:19:17,559 --> 01:19:21,095
But you had to do it.
Breslaw programmed him
to kill you.

1000
01:19:21,128 --> 01:19:23,998
Those numbers
on your display are
mind-control codes.

1001
01:19:24,031 --> 01:19:25,866
10 nautical miles
and closing.

1002
01:19:25,899 --> 01:19:28,369
You were right, Tom.
There was something wrong.

1003
01:19:28,402 --> 01:19:30,804
I only worked
for Anderson.

1004
01:19:30,838 --> 01:19:33,040
I don't think he even knew
what breslaw was doing.

1005
01:19:33,073 --> 01:19:36,944
<i>They lied to me.</i>
<i>They were controlling you.</i>

1006
01:19:37,579 --> 01:19:39,813
Outlaw, this is
pike control.

1007
01:19:39,847 --> 01:19:41,348
Tom:
<i>Is that you, Wyatt?</i>

1008
01:19:41,382 --> 01:19:42,983
Yeah, captain, it's me.

1009
01:19:43,017 --> 01:19:44,918
What she said is true.

1010
01:19:44,952 --> 01:19:47,121
Warlord--
five nautical miles.

1011
01:19:49,089 --> 01:19:51,892
Tom:
<i>I'm on my way.</i>

1012
01:19:55,129 --> 01:19:56,830
( Beeping )

1013
01:19:56,864 --> 01:19:59,333
Control,
my weapons won't arm.

1014
01:19:59,366 --> 01:20:01,902
Your weapons won't arm
unless you're in v.R.

1015
01:20:01,935 --> 01:20:04,905
- That was my idea.
- Control, turn my v.R. Back on.

1016
01:20:04,938 --> 01:20:07,609
No, Tom, you can't.
Breslaw can feed you codes.

1017
01:20:07,642 --> 01:20:10,244
You see, Tom,
it's sort of a catch-22.

1018
01:20:10,277 --> 01:20:12,346
Turn on your v.R.
And I'll break you.

1019
01:20:12,379 --> 01:20:14,848
Leave it off,
you're helpless.

1020
01:20:14,882 --> 01:20:17,117
- Power me up, Wyatt.
- No!

1021
01:20:17,151 --> 01:20:19,486
Tom:
<i>Just do it!</i>
<i>That's an order!</i>

1022
01:20:29,430 --> 01:20:32,099
Rainmaker:
Control, where's our help?

1023
01:20:35,903 --> 01:20:38,839
Tom: I've got
warlord in my sights.
I'm moving in.

1024
01:20:40,441 --> 01:20:43,143
( Buzzes )

1025
01:20:46,113 --> 01:20:49,116
- ( Static hiss )
- He's jamming me.

1026
01:20:49,149 --> 01:20:51,519
I can't get a missile lock.
I'm switching to guns.

1027
01:20:51,553 --> 01:20:53,521
- That won't be necessary.
- ( Beeps )

1028
01:20:53,555 --> 01:20:55,557
( Beeping )

1029
01:21:02,630 --> 01:21:04,998
Tom, do you see
that number flashing?

1030
01:21:05,032 --> 01:21:07,434
( Confused )
Numbers?

1031
01:21:09,336 --> 01:21:11,171
Tom, that's a transition code.

1032
01:21:11,205 --> 01:21:12,940
You've been programmed
to follow signals

1033
01:21:12,973 --> 01:21:15,109
following this number.
Do you understand that?

1034
01:21:16,143 --> 01:21:17,244
Yeah.

1035
01:21:17,277 --> 01:21:19,012
You do
what's right, Tom.

1036
01:21:19,046 --> 01:21:21,482
That's what you've
been trained for.

1037
01:21:21,516 --> 01:21:24,051
I'm doing it.

1038
01:21:28,021 --> 01:21:30,157
Damn it!

1039
01:21:50,745 --> 01:21:52,012
Damn!

1040
01:21:58,586 --> 01:22:02,055
I should've taken you
out of the program
a long time ago.

1041
01:22:03,090 --> 01:22:04,726
- I'll do it now.
- ( Beeps )

1042
01:22:04,759 --> 01:22:07,027
( Pinging )

1043
01:22:12,166 --> 01:22:14,067
Warlord is locking
onto outlaw.

1044
01:22:15,302 --> 01:22:18,038
- ( Alarm buzzes )
- Outlaws can't be heroes, Tom.

1045
01:22:19,306 --> 01:22:20,742
Missile away.
Missile away.

1046
01:22:20,775 --> 01:22:22,176
Get the hell
out of there!

1047
01:22:32,019 --> 01:22:35,088
Is this how you take care
of your boys, general?

1048
01:22:38,358 --> 01:22:40,060
You're goddamn right!

1049

1050
01:23:08,790 --> 01:23:10,692
Son of a bitch.

( Alarm buzzes )

1052
01:23:31,378 --> 01:23:34,549
( Both sigh )

1053
01:23:47,729 --> 01:23:51,131
- Tom: <i>No. </i>
- Tom?

1054
01:23:53,768 --> 01:23:56,069
Oh god.

1055
01:23:56,103 --> 01:23:57,739
That's the same code
cowboy got

1056
01:23:57,772 --> 01:23:59,774
- just before he...
- Killed himself.

1057
01:24:00,875 --> 01:24:03,210
Turn it off.
Turn off the goddamn v.R.

1058
01:24:03,243 --> 01:24:06,280
<i>( Keyboard clacks )</i>

1059
01:24:06,313 --> 01:24:09,082
I can't.
The general must've
locked US out.

1060
01:24:11,451 --> 01:24:13,453
( Breathing heavily )

1061
01:24:26,668 --> 01:24:28,435
Tom, now listen to me.

1062
01:24:28,468 --> 01:24:30,304
That's the suicide code.

1063
01:24:30,337 --> 01:24:32,874
Don't do this, Tom.
Just put the gun down.

1064
01:24:32,907 --> 01:24:34,742
<i>Do you hear me?</i>
<i>Put the gun down!</i>

1065
01:24:36,343 --> 01:24:38,211
<i>Tom, answer me.</i>

1066
01:24:38,913 --> 01:24:40,247
Tom!

1067
01:24:41,616 --> 01:24:44,151
<i>Don't be like cowboy.</i>

1068
01:24:44,184 --> 01:24:47,154
Just think for yourself, Tom!
Just think for yourself.

1069
01:24:47,187 --> 01:24:48,388
You don't have
to die like that.

1070
01:24:49,591 --> 01:24:51,425
<i>What the hell</i>
<i>do you believe in, Tom?</i>

1071
01:24:51,458 --> 01:24:53,493
<i>What, fighting?</i>
<i>You want someone</i>
<i>to fight with?</i>

1072
01:24:53,528 --> 01:24:56,196
Is that what you need?
Well, god damn it,
listen to me!

1073
01:24:56,229 --> 01:24:58,231
I will fight
with you, Tom!
Listen to me!

1074
01:24:58,265 --> 01:25:00,602
I will fight with you,
you weak bastard!

1075
01:25:21,421 --> 01:25:23,223
Tom:
<i>What did you call me?</i>

1076
01:25:26,326 --> 01:25:28,328
( Laughs )

1077
01:25:51,318 --> 01:25:53,253

Hey, captain.

1080
01:26:00,695 --> 01:26:03,698
Joe, call me Tom,
would you?

1081
01:26:03,731 --> 01:26:05,800
Where you headed, Tom?

1082
01:26:05,833 --> 01:26:08,502
I figured we'd check out
the countryside

1083
01:26:08,536 --> 01:26:10,303
from a different perspective.

1084
01:26:10,337 --> 01:26:12,172
I got something for you.

1085
01:26:13,941 --> 01:26:17,344
- Here you go.
- Wow, a flight suit.
Man, that's...

1086
01:26:18,913 --> 01:26:20,848
- You sure?
- Tom: <i>Yup.</i>

1087
01:26:20,882 --> 01:26:25,252
- I'm sure.
- He's not gonna be needing it
where we're going.

1088
01:26:26,253 --> 01:26:28,255
( Clicking )

1089
01:26:31,893 --> 01:26:33,961
