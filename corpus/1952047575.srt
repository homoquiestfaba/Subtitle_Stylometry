0
00:00:28,498 --> 00:00:30,989
Listen, kid, i hate to tell you this,

1
00:00:31,067 --> 00:00:33,695
but we gotta be off this mountain
in 20 minutes.

2
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:35,704
There`s a storm coming.

3
00:00:38,108 --> 00:00:39,905
Ty,

4
00:00:39,976 --> 00:00:42,274
i`m your eyes on this one, kid.

5
00:00:51,988 --> 00:00:54,286
On three. One, two, three.

6
00:01:13,476 --> 00:01:16,445
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Beaver Creek, Colorado,

7
00:01:16,513 --> 00:01:19,812
home of the Birds of Prey
Men`s World Cup Downhill.

8
00:02:58,081 --> 00:03:01,482
Twelve in the chute. Twelve in the chute.
Here we go.

9
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:08,052
On five, four, three, two, one.

10
00:03:14,831 --> 00:03:17,322
Tyler Crowe is in the start house.

11
00:03:18,535 --> 00:03:21,766
He`s just... Just let him know
that down here the brink is deep.

12
00:03:21,838 --> 00:03:23,499
it`s iced up. He`s gotta go easy.

13
00:03:23,573 --> 00:03:24,904
Hey, Tyler,

14
00:03:25,108 --> 00:03:27,941
this course doesn`t really begin
till you make it through the brink.

15
00:03:28,011 --> 00:03:30,377
You overcook that turn and you`re toast.

16
00:03:30,447 --> 00:03:33,905
You gotta conserve your strength
for the bottom section.

17
00:03:34,551 --> 00:03:36,382
lt`s icing up pretty good.

18
00:03:36,453 --> 00:03:40,184
lt`s way more rutted than it was
when you guys were training.

19
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:43,350
Remember to throttle back to hold your line.

20
00:03:43,426 --> 00:03:46,190
Focus on that, understand? Understand?

21
00:03:47,564 --> 00:03:52,501
Montana comes barreling over the jump.
And he`s 0. 7 ahead. Unbelievable.

22
00:03:53,403 --> 00:03:54,427
-Hey, Coach.
-Yeah.

23
00:03:54,504 --> 00:03:56,199
He`s one second ahead of the Austrians.

24
00:03:56,272 --> 00:03:58,137
Nobody is one second ahead on this course.

25
00:03:58,208 --> 00:04:01,177
Racer down. Racer down.
We have a course hold.

26
00:04:03,113 --> 00:04:05,946
-How`s the knee?
-lt`s good.

27
00:04:07,217 --> 00:04:10,243
Okay, Tyler, this one`s yours.
You know what do.

28
00:04:13,623 --> 00:04:16,649
And now in the starting gate,
it`s American Tyler Crowe.

29
00:04:16,726 --> 00:04:18,353
Who would have thought
after two knee surgeries,

30
00:04:18,428 --> 00:04:21,363
the thoroughbred from Snow Basin
would bounce back

31
00:04:21,431 --> 00:04:23,626
for yet another downhill World Cup season?

32
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:26,032
Look at the intensity in the start house.

33
00:04:26,102 --> 00:04:28,297
-On five, four...
-Hold the line. Focus on it.

34
00:04:28,371 --> 00:04:30,862
...three, two, one.

35
00:04:37,947 --> 00:04:41,383
He`s really a cannonball, Chad.
Never a bad start with Crowe.

36
00:05:01,104 --> 00:05:04,540
Wow, in perfect forms,
Crowe hits the first big air.

37
00:05:06,976 --> 00:05:09,069
Oh, he`s doing awesome, Trace.

38
00:05:09,145 --> 00:05:11,841
He`s flying, Chad. But let`s hope
he can keep it together through the brink

39
00:05:11,915 --> 00:05:14,577
where most of the racers
are having trouble today.

40
00:05:32,335 --> 00:05:34,360
He`s half a second ahead.

41
00:05:36,873 --> 00:05:40,172
Just one last turn
separates Crowe from the lead,

42
00:05:40,243 --> 00:05:43,178
in what will be a difficult time to beat.

43
00:05:45,515 --> 00:05:49,349
Oh, he`s off balance. Oh, and he goes down.
Huge crash, Chad.

44
00:05:53,556 --> 00:05:56,719
Tyler Crowe, what an unbelievable crash.

45
00:05:58,728 --> 00:06:02,164
But, Trace, he`s moving.
lt looks like he`s gonna be okay.

46
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:05,497
lt`s not the type of air time you want
downhill racing, is it?

47
00:06:05,568 --> 00:06:08,162
lt is not. And look at this.
The butt hits the snow.

48
00:06:08,238 --> 00:06:11,139
The ski loads up and he gets high sided.

49
00:06:11,207 --> 00:06:15,041
The full carcass huck upside down,
all the way around.

50
00:06:15,512 --> 00:06:17,707
Tyler Crowe, what a maniac.

51
00:06:21,985 --> 00:06:25,182
Once again, Chad,
Tyler Crowe has handed us yet another gem

52
00:06:25,255 --> 00:06:28,554
for the highlight reel.
l can`t believe that crash.

53
00:06:32,529 --> 00:06:35,498
l can`t believe you walked away
from that one. See, that was...

54
00:06:35,565 --> 00:06:36,964
-Coach?
-Yeah.

55
00:06:37,033 --> 00:06:39,593
Hey, guys, l need Tyler for a minute.

56
00:06:50,713 --> 00:06:54,410
-What`s up, Coach?
-Apparently, that was a world-class digger.

57
00:06:54,951 --> 00:06:57,044
Yeah. Well, the course was...

58
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,610
lt was pretty roughed up.
l wasn`t expecting it.

59
00:06:58,688 --> 00:07:00,713
Do you wanna win, Tyler?

60
00:07:01,124 --> 00:07:03,615
-Are you serious?
-You push too hard. You don`t listen.

61
00:07:03,693 --> 00:07:06,924
-l caught an edge. lt happens.
-Bullshit.

62
00:07:07,163 --> 00:07:09,154
You hit that turn at full throttle.

63
00:07:09,232 --> 00:07:14,033
Well, you know what? With all due respect,
you have no idea what you`re talking about.

64
00:07:14,103 --> 00:07:16,196
You`re off the team, Tyler.

65
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:19,599
-What?
-Yeah.

66
00:07:20,243 --> 00:07:22,370
l think you need some time,

67
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:26,212
you know, to figure out what you want,
what you really want.

68
00:07:26,282 --> 00:07:27,749
l know what l really want.

69
00:07:27,817 --> 00:07:30,980
lf that were true,
the whole world would know it.

70
00:07:42,865 --> 00:07:45,356
Ladies and gentlemen,
put your hands together

71
00:07:45,435 --> 00:07:49,872
for the Birds of Prey champion,
Austrian Andre Meyer.

72
00:07:55,011 --> 00:07:57,536
How good can i get at snowboarding?

73
00:07:57,614 --> 00:08:01,675
i think the question is
how good can snowboarding get for me?

74
00:08:04,754 --> 00:08:07,621
You saw that. You had to have seen that.

75
00:08:36,953 --> 00:08:37,942
Dude.

76
00:08:38,054 --> 00:08:41,751
-You don`t think it`s doable, do you?
-Anything`s doable.

77
00:08:54,003 --> 00:08:57,769
-l broke my ass.
-More like you broke the mountain.

78
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,634
Just a sec, all right?

79
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:38,529
Shit!

80
00:10:41,377 --> 00:10:45,905
Elisa Rider, when did you get old enough
to start serving booze?

81
00:10:49,218 --> 00:10:51,686
What... What are you doing here?
l thought you were gone all winter.

82
00:10:51,754 --> 00:10:53,745
You seem disappointed.

83
00:10:54,524 --> 00:10:57,049
No, l`m... l`m just surprised, is all.

84
00:10:59,495 --> 00:11:00,553
You know, you don`t look hurt

85
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:03,565
and Mark didn`t mention anything
about you coming home, so...

86
00:11:03,633 --> 00:11:07,626
No, l haven`t talked to him yet.

87
00:11:07,703 --> 00:11:10,501
Actually, l didn`t talk to anybody. lt was...

88
00:11:13,176 --> 00:11:17,010
Kind of one those last-minute
kind of things, you know.

89
00:11:18,014 --> 00:11:20,312
And you decided to come here first?

90
00:11:20,383 --> 00:11:23,580
What can l say?
l thought a beer sounded pretty good.

91
00:11:26,422 --> 00:11:27,855
Of course.

92
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:41,602
So, where is that old brother
of yours, anyway?

93
00:11:45,074 --> 00:11:46,598
Mark.

94
00:11:46,676 --> 00:11:49,270
-Hitting on my sister?
-Maybe l am.

95
00:11:51,547 --> 00:11:53,538
Come here, man. lt`s good seeing you.

96
00:11:53,616 --> 00:11:56,312
-How you been? lt`s been a long time.
-Too long, huh?

97
00:11:56,385 --> 00:11:58,683
-Hey, beer`s on me, fellas.
-All right.

98
00:11:58,754 --> 00:12:01,245
-Oh, great.
-These guys with you?

99
00:12:01,324 --> 00:12:06,159
Oh, didn`t you hear? Your best friend here
is the subject of his own documentary.

100
00:12:07,563 --> 00:12:09,827
What? You got a problem with that?

101
00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:14,666
No, man, no problem. Just it seems kind of
like a waste of film, don`t you think?

102
00:12:14,737 --> 00:12:17,205
Hey, don`t tell my investors that.

103
00:12:18,107 --> 00:12:20,632
Stephan Weeks.

104
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:24,146
-l know who you are.
-You do? How come?

105
00:12:24,213 --> 00:12:27,410
l guess it was a few years ago,
l believe in December,

106
00:12:27,483 --> 00:12:29,348
you sent Mark here off the Nose

107
00:12:29,418 --> 00:12:32,979
when there was less than 1 2 inches of snow
on the ground, just for a shot.

108
00:12:33,055 --> 00:12:36,252
-That was sick, too.
-Dude, you broke your collarbone.

109
00:12:36,325 --> 00:12:39,419
-Yeah, but it was still a hell of a shot.
-lt was a hell of a shot.

110
00:12:39,495 --> 00:12:41,463
And because of that shot,
Mark here can go to any bar

111
00:12:41,531 --> 00:12:44,864
in any ski town in the world
and drink for free, right?

112
00:12:44,934 --> 00:12:46,731
Cheers. Made him a legend, that shot.

113
00:12:46,802 --> 00:12:48,770
You hear that, sis? A legend.

114
00:12:50,907 --> 00:12:52,875
lt`s on, bro, Meteorite.

115
00:12:55,278 --> 00:12:56,677
Meteorite?

116
00:12:57,313 --> 00:13:00,942
That`s what this is about?
You`re going to Alaska?

117
00:13:01,484 --> 00:13:05,614
-Dude, you out of your mind?
-You know, she still hasn`t been ridden.

118
00:13:05,688 --> 00:13:09,283
-Yeah, there`s a reason for that, Stephan...
-And the reason is because nobody`s tried.

119
00:13:09,358 --> 00:13:13,317
-Not since Randy Klein in `92.
-You mean, not since he died.

120
00:13:15,431 --> 00:13:16,898
This is fun.

121
00:13:19,902 --> 00:13:21,733
Mark, dude, you`re out of your mind.

122
00:13:21,804 --> 00:13:23,567
Everybody knows
that mountain`s not doable.

123
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:27,575
l already found a line on the north face.
lt`s totally doable, man.

124
00:13:28,911 --> 00:13:32,244
-You think?
-CJ and l leave the day after tomorrow.

125
00:13:33,849 --> 00:13:35,646
Meteorite with CJ?

126
00:13:35,718 --> 00:13:39,313
Your ass is always busy chasing gates
and working for the man.

127
00:13:39,388 --> 00:13:43,154
We`re doing dawn patrol on Zorba`s Ridge
tomorrow. Are you down?

128
00:13:43,225 --> 00:13:44,522
-Yeah, l`m down.
-All right, cool.

129
00:13:44,594 --> 00:13:47,222
lt`s good seeing you, man. Stay up.

130
00:13:48,464 --> 00:13:50,455
-Later, Rider.
-Laters.

131
00:14:40,049 --> 00:14:44,349
Must be a little weird having to carry
your own skis again, hey, Crowe?

132
00:14:44,587 --> 00:14:48,921
-Should l get you a Sherpa?
-l think l can manage.

133
00:14:49,959 --> 00:14:51,392
We`ll see.

134
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:04,103
-No place like home, huh?
-Oh, man.

135
00:15:08,144 --> 00:15:11,307
l don`t think l have ever seen it like this.
Ever.

136
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:13,541
Been such an epic winter this year.

137
00:15:13,616 --> 00:15:17,177
-Check out the Devil`s Coattails over there.
-Wow!

138
00:15:17,253 --> 00:15:21,451
-Can you believe how filled in it is?
-Man, where have l been?

139
00:15:22,024 --> 00:15:23,685
The racecourse.

140
00:15:23,993 --> 00:15:27,258
Hey, Ty, l realize how awkward this must be
without that cute little spandex, huh?

141
00:15:27,329 --> 00:15:29,593
So, if you want me to go first, man...

142
00:15:38,874 --> 00:15:41,638
-You still got it.
-Yeah, Crowe.

143
00:16:12,975 --> 00:16:14,237
What took you so long?

144
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:17,871
Just glad to see you still know how to ride
something without a starting gate.

145
00:16:23,886 --> 00:16:25,615
Yeah, CJ.

146
00:16:31,327 --> 00:16:32,817
Look at that, boys.

147
00:16:32,895 --> 00:16:35,557
That`s what l`m talking about, cold smoke.

148
00:16:35,898 --> 00:16:39,527
White gold. lt is, man.
That is all-time, right there.

149
00:18:36,886 --> 00:18:37,910
Hey.

150
00:18:46,328 --> 00:18:47,693
Oh, my God.

151
00:18:55,337 --> 00:18:57,532
Where have you been? Where you been?

152
00:18:57,606 --> 00:19:00,040
-l`ve been here.
-Awesome.

153
00:19:31,573 --> 00:19:35,270
So, word on the street is
you got kicked off the ski team.

154
00:19:35,611 --> 00:19:36,771
ls it?

155
00:19:40,082 --> 00:19:42,846
lt was a little less dramatic than that.

156
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:48,386
lt`s funny, l just... l never thought l`d hear
the end of that drumbeat.

157
00:19:49,725 --> 00:19:51,590
-Don`t.
-What?

158
00:19:52,428 --> 00:19:53,952
-l know what you`re doing.
-What am l doing?

159
00:19:54,029 --> 00:19:55,963
l`m just looking at you.

160
00:19:56,999 --> 00:20:01,561
Yeah. And the last time you looked at me
like that we wound up back at your place.

161
00:20:01,637 --> 00:20:05,937
And l seem to remember the words
``huge mistake``

162
00:20:06,008 --> 00:20:08,238
and, oh, yeah, it gets better,

163
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:11,438
``Skiing out of bounds
with my best friend`s sister.``

164
00:20:11,513 --> 00:20:13,140
-Okay, l would never have said...
-Oh?

165
00:20:13,215 --> 00:20:14,876
-...``skiing out of bounds.``
-What?

166
00:20:17,353 --> 00:20:20,322
You know, your brother would kill me
if he found out.

167
00:20:20,389 --> 00:20:23,324
-You know what l think?
-What do you think?

168
00:20:23,392 --> 00:20:27,158
l think that if l wasn`t Mark`s sister,

169
00:20:28,263 --> 00:20:30,993
you wouldn`t be attracted to me at all.

170
00:20:32,468 --> 00:20:34,766
Really? And why is that?

171
00:20:36,071 --> 00:20:37,766
Because it`s safe.

172
00:20:39,975 --> 00:20:42,671
And you know it`s never gonna happen.

173
00:20:43,545 --> 00:20:48,414
You all wanna get a little bit of a taste
of what Rider and l are gonna do in Alaska?

174
00:20:49,785 --> 00:20:52,754
Well, let`s get this party started.

175
00:21:09,371 --> 00:21:12,636
CJ? CJ? Say something, man.

176
00:21:23,719 --> 00:21:26,085
Well, thanks for driving me home.

177
00:21:27,823 --> 00:21:28,983
-You wouldn`t wanna...
-No.

178
00:21:29,058 --> 00:21:30,457
Okay. Right.

179
00:22:04,526 --> 00:22:07,154
Still keep your trophies out?

180
00:22:07,229 --> 00:22:09,754
Shut up. l know l`m a dork.

181
00:22:13,135 --> 00:22:16,263
-You`re gonna miss it, aren`t you?
-l don`t know.

182
00:22:17,272 --> 00:22:20,241
You know, l...
l`ve been racing my whole life.

183
00:22:20,309 --> 00:22:21,833
l never even...

184
00:22:23,545 --> 00:22:26,708
l never even considered
what l`d do if l wasn`t.

185
00:22:29,418 --> 00:22:32,353
You`re a real loner, aren`t you, Tyler Crowe?

186
00:22:34,323 --> 00:22:37,349
Yeah, l guess so. l have no choice.

187
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:57,044
Shit. lt`s your brother.

188
00:22:58,013 --> 00:22:59,480
Ty!

189
00:22:59,548 --> 00:23:01,846
Your truck is in the driveway.
He knows you`re here.

190
00:23:01,917 --> 00:23:02,941
Oh, he`s gonna kill me.

191
00:23:05,487 --> 00:23:08,320
-Ty!
-lt`s okay. l`ll talk to him.

192
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:11,120
-Are you out of your mind?
-He already knows l`m here.

193
00:23:11,193 --> 00:23:12,956
We`ve got to come up with a story.

194
00:23:13,028 --> 00:23:14,586
You were too drunk to drive
so l insisted you stay here.

195
00:23:14,663 --> 00:23:16,631
And then we had mad,
passionate, animal sex.

196
00:23:16,698 --> 00:23:18,131
No, listen.

197
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:20,861
-Yo, Ty?
-Then you slept on the couch,

198
00:23:20,936 --> 00:23:24,372
and l slept on the bed or should you have
slept on the bed and l slept on the couch?

199
00:23:24,439 --> 00:23:25,463
-Tyler.
-What?

200
00:23:25,541 --> 00:23:27,168
-Your fly.
-Right.

201
00:23:31,914 --> 00:23:35,008
-Ty, open up, man. Get your jacket.
-What?

202
00:23:35,117 --> 00:23:37,051
Get your jacket. Let`s go.

203
00:23:38,487 --> 00:23:41,684
-Come on.
-Wait up. Where are we going?

204
00:23:41,757 --> 00:23:43,816
-Alaska.
-Alaska?

205
00:23:43,959 --> 00:23:45,824
CJ broke his leg.

206
00:23:49,731 --> 00:23:51,164
Be right with you, guys.

207
00:24:04,012 --> 00:24:07,175
-So you wanna talk about this?
-Talk about what?

208
00:24:10,018 --> 00:24:12,919
-Elisa.
-What about her?

209
00:24:12,988 --> 00:24:14,615
Dude, come on.

210
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:18,421
You walked right past her truck.
l know you know she was at my house.

211
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:20,560
-Man, where is he?
-Who?

212
00:24:21,697 --> 00:24:24,723
-Mark, come on. l wanna talk about this.
-What`s there to talk about?

213
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,496
You nailed my sister. Pretty cool, huh?
How was she?

214
00:24:27,569 --> 00:24:29,537
-How was she?
-Stop. lt wasn`t like that.

215
00:24:29,605 --> 00:24:31,630
You guys just sit up and talk
the whole night?

216
00:24:31,707 --> 00:24:33,800
lf you got a problem with that,
l`d rather you just say that...

217
00:24:33,875 --> 00:24:35,001
-Yo, Steph.
-Hey. Yeah,

218
00:24:35,077 --> 00:24:37,705
l`ll keep you posted. Okay, great.

219
00:24:37,779 --> 00:24:40,942
Ciao. Hey. Sorry, guys. lnvestors.
You gotta love them, huh?

220
00:24:41,016 --> 00:24:44,110
-No worries. We just got here ourselves.
-Cool.

221
00:24:44,753 --> 00:24:46,948
Can l have some coffee, hon?

222
00:24:47,022 --> 00:24:49,183
-Thanks.
-Thank you.

223
00:24:49,358 --> 00:24:53,818
Hey, Ty, l`m stoked you`re on board.
l can`t think of a better replacement for CJ.

224
00:24:56,231 --> 00:24:58,028
Did Mark fill you in?

225
00:24:58,267 --> 00:24:59,962
Mark hasn`t said much of anything
this morning.

226
00:25:00,035 --> 00:25:02,094
-Dude, she`s not just another piece of ass.
-Did l say she was?

227
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:04,138
-Good, `cause she`s not.
-l know.

228
00:25:04,206 --> 00:25:05,298
You guys in the middle of something here?

229
00:25:05,374 --> 00:25:06,534
-No.
-No.

230
00:25:08,043 --> 00:25:10,671
You know, it`s a better story, you know.
You guys,

231
00:25:10,746 --> 00:25:12,270
you`ve been skiing together
since you could walk.

232
00:25:12,347 --> 00:25:13,678
You go your own separate ways,
come back together,

233
00:25:13,749 --> 00:25:16,946
ski the ultimate mountain.
Oh, it`s bloody great.

234
00:25:20,555 --> 00:25:21,920
A contract?

235
00:25:26,028 --> 00:25:27,689
Are you serious?

236
00:25:30,165 --> 00:25:32,531
Look, we`re not just making
another ski flick here.

237
00:25:32,601 --> 00:25:34,091
l wanna make a movie
that`s gonna set the benchmark

238
00:25:34,169 --> 00:25:37,263
for all sports action films for years to come.

239
00:25:37,339 --> 00:25:41,742
My commitment to this project, to Mark,
to both of your safety, is solid.

240
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:46,577
So how about it, bro?

241
00:25:48,317 --> 00:25:50,547
Down for a shot at greatness?

242
00:25:51,286 --> 00:25:52,947
What do you say?

243
00:25:55,057 --> 00:25:57,617
-Give me a pen.
-Great.

244
00:26:05,901 --> 00:26:07,425
More sugar.

245
00:26:15,744 --> 00:26:19,202
-You will look out for him, won`t you?
-Of course, l will.

246
00:26:19,281 --> 00:26:24,082
No, l`m serious, Ty, `cause, you know,
you`re the responsible one

247
00:26:24,152 --> 00:26:28,748
and if something`s not safe
and it`s not doable,

248
00:26:29,624 --> 00:26:33,219
-then you gotta make him back off.
-We`ll come back in one piece.

249
00:26:33,295 --> 00:26:34,922
And what about...

250
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,329
-Us?
-Yeah.

251
00:26:40,802 --> 00:26:42,463
He`ll get over it.

252
00:26:44,206 --> 00:26:47,266
-l wasn`t talking about him.
-What?

253
00:26:48,143 --> 00:26:50,270
Are you sure you want this?

254
00:26:51,713 --> 00:26:53,180
l`m positive.

255
00:27:37,926 --> 00:27:39,791
Hey, guys, this is Dean Bauer.

256
00:27:39,861 --> 00:27:40,850
He`s gonna be your guide up here,

257
00:27:40,929 --> 00:27:42,021
take care of us while we shoot this thing.

258
00:27:42,097 --> 00:27:44,122
-Hey, Dean.
-What`s up? Mark.

259
00:27:44,199 --> 00:27:45,530
l`m Tyler.

260
00:27:51,139 --> 00:27:52,800
Welcome to Alaska.

261
00:27:54,009 --> 00:27:57,809
Listen, the weather`s getting bad.
Load up your shit here.

262
00:27:57,879 --> 00:28:00,040
We`ll get this show on the road.

263
00:28:01,149 --> 00:28:02,946
Okay, let`s load up.

264
00:28:20,435 --> 00:28:22,335
Welcome to the junk show.

265
00:28:22,404 --> 00:28:25,430
This will be your home
for the next two weeks.

266
00:28:29,044 --> 00:28:31,672
-Jesus. The place reeks.
-Yeah.

267
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:34,078
lt reeks like yo` mamma.

268
00:28:34,149 --> 00:28:37,118
Dude, you love that joke. You smell that?

269
00:28:38,353 --> 00:28:41,789
-What?
-Smells like... Smells like home.

270
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:46,957
-What`s up, guys?
-You`re just arriving now?

271
00:28:49,831 --> 00:28:53,358
-You missed an epic day up there.
-Oh, yes. lt was super sick.

272
00:28:55,237 --> 00:28:57,671
-We`ll catch it tomorrow.
-Oh, no.

273
00:28:58,106 --> 00:29:00,199
Haven`t you heard the news?

274
00:29:01,243 --> 00:29:03,768
There is big storm coming in.

275
00:29:04,379 --> 00:29:05,539
Huge.

276
00:29:07,215 --> 00:29:08,739
Just kidding.

277
00:29:16,324 --> 00:29:17,586
See you.

278
00:29:21,596 --> 00:29:24,588
l`m glad to see there`s not going to be
lack of entertainment.

279
00:29:24,666 --> 00:29:27,829
-Do you have any idea who that was?
-Enlighten me.

280
00:29:27,903 --> 00:29:31,964
Hubert Haddad. One of the best
big mountain boarders in the world.

281
00:29:32,407 --> 00:29:35,501
No shit?
What do you think he`s doing here?

282
00:29:35,777 --> 00:29:39,372
-Think he`s here for Meteorite?
-We`re here for Meteorite.

283
00:29:40,482 --> 00:29:42,040
-Yes, we are, brother.
-Meteorite, man.

284
00:29:42,117 --> 00:29:44,108
We`re doing it. We`re doing it!

285
00:29:44,185 --> 00:29:45,982
Damn, that feels good.

286
00:29:46,054 --> 00:29:49,285
Hey, guys. Dean`s office, five minutes.
Okay?

287
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:56,893
You guys better forget everything you`ve
ever heard about high-elevation snow.

288
00:29:57,699 --> 00:29:59,223
This is Alaska.

289
00:30:00,635 --> 00:30:03,103
8,000-foot conditions at sea level.

290
00:30:05,106 --> 00:30:08,769
lt`s sticky and condensed
and it won`t crumble up

291
00:30:08,843 --> 00:30:14,179
like that Sierra cement
or that soft Utah powder

292
00:30:14,382 --> 00:30:17,010
that you guys are probably used to.

293
00:30:18,453 --> 00:30:20,921
lt`ll bust loose and when it does, man,

294
00:30:20,989 --> 00:30:23,514
it`ll fracture down 20, 25 foot

295
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:29,420
and take you with it and we`ll be digging
you out in the summertime.

296
00:30:33,134 --> 00:30:35,261
We don`t want that to happen.

297
00:30:35,437 --> 00:30:39,066
So l hope you got
fresh batteries in your transceivers

298
00:30:40,175 --> 00:30:41,733
and shovels and whatnot.

299
00:30:41,810 --> 00:30:45,940
We`re all set. We just need to know
the game plan for tomorrow, Dean.

300
00:30:46,014 --> 00:30:48,881
Well, Fissile Peak,

301
00:30:50,285 --> 00:30:52,947
the closest to Meteorite as l can get

302
00:30:54,122 --> 00:30:57,114
in pitch, but it`s only one-tenth the size.

303
00:31:01,329 --> 00:31:03,763
You better start picking your lines, boys.

304
00:31:09,137 --> 00:31:14,905
it aii starts here. in just two weeks,
the US quest for the Worid Cup goid

305
00:31:14,976 --> 00:31:17,342
carves its way to Chamonix, France

306
00:31:17,412 --> 00:31:20,813
where the US ski team wiii attempt
to saivage a season rocked

307
00:31:20,882 --> 00:31:23,009
with injury and heartbreak.

308
00:31:23,084 --> 00:31:28,351
Can a young, inexperienced American team
beat the Austrian powerhouse?

309
00:31:28,423 --> 00:31:33,827
Tune in to NTN,
your home for winter sports teievision.

310
00:31:35,063 --> 00:31:38,260
Honestly, man, l don`t know
how you ever put up with them.

311
00:31:38,333 --> 00:31:39,857
They weren`t so bad.

312
00:31:39,934 --> 00:31:41,299
-You`re kidding me, right?
-What?

313
00:31:41,569 --> 00:31:44,163
-They booted you off the team.
-Yeah, well,

314
00:31:44,239 --> 00:31:46,002
l don`t know.
Everything happens for a reason, right?

315
00:31:46,074 --> 00:31:48,372
l mean, l wouldn`t be here.

316
00:31:48,476 --> 00:31:50,000
True that.

317
00:32:07,295 --> 00:32:10,992
-No. You still have that?
-Yeah. lt looks after me.

318
00:32:11,299 --> 00:32:14,462
-Dude, it`s a rock.
-lt`s a cool rock.

319
00:32:15,437 --> 00:32:18,338
Remember that time up in Telluride
when l busted my leg?

320
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:21,200
-l left it at home that day.
-And?

321
00:32:21,276 --> 00:32:25,406
So, as long as l`m 9,000 feet above sea level,
this baby is coming with me.

322
00:32:25,513 --> 00:32:27,538
Don`t you think you can pick something
a little smaller,

323
00:32:27,615 --> 00:32:30,880
like a bracelet, maybe an anklet?

324
00:32:30,952 --> 00:32:33,182
-Something more along your style?
-Oh, an anklet is my style.

325
00:32:33,254 --> 00:32:35,245
-Let me see it.
-No. What are you doing? Go sit down.

326
00:32:35,323 --> 00:32:37,951
-Go write your letter.
-Dude, l just wanna see the rock.

327
00:32:38,026 --> 00:32:40,517
-This is my rock, Ty. You`ll contaminate it.
-Are you serious?

328
00:32:40,595 --> 00:32:43,587
-Ty, Ty. Don`t mess with my boulder...
-Come on, dude...

329
00:32:45,233 --> 00:32:46,427
You`re crazy, man.

330
00:33:12,393 --> 00:33:16,853
-So this is my backyard. What do you think?
-it is unbeiievabie.

331
00:33:17,899 --> 00:33:20,561
There she is, boys, Meteorite.

332
00:33:21,469 --> 00:33:25,633
Hoiy crap. Check it out right there, the peak.
We can drop in on that, definiteiy.

333
00:33:25,707 --> 00:33:27,538
Take that iine down.

334
00:33:28,243 --> 00:33:30,541
Hey, Dean, drop me off anywhere,
i`m serious.

335
00:33:30,678 --> 00:33:33,704
-Yeah. Anywhere, huh?
-Anywhere. Come on.

336
00:33:34,849 --> 00:33:38,444
Not today, cowboy.
You guys got some training to do.

337
00:34:15,223 --> 00:34:18,420
Check it out. Looks like heaven, huh?

338
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:26,024
-lt`s great. Okay, Mark, you ready for us?
-Let`s do it.

339
00:34:29,237 --> 00:34:31,671
-Camera one, set.
-Camera two, set.

340
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:35,236
Okay, Rider, iet`s see what you got.

341
00:34:37,011 --> 00:34:38,569
Bottoms up.

342
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:50,522
All right. Easy, easy, easy. Take it easy now.
This is your first run.

343
00:35:15,583 --> 00:35:17,483
That was sweet, brother.

344
00:35:21,689 --> 00:35:23,122
Oh, yeah.

345
00:35:47,148 --> 00:35:52,176
Okay, on three. Three, two, one.

346
00:35:55,623 --> 00:35:58,148
l`m rolling. ls anybody going?
What are we doing here?

347
00:35:58,459 --> 00:36:01,019
Hey, Tyler, we`re wasting fiim here, okay?

348
00:36:03,164 --> 00:36:04,722
Damn you, Rider.

349
00:37:17,572 --> 00:37:18,903
Get that latch.

350
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:35,314
-Happy now, cowboy?
-Very.

351
00:37:45,199 --> 00:37:51,661
-l wish l could be there with you guys.
-Oh, l wish you could, too. l miss you.

352
00:37:53,374 --> 00:37:56,241
-Call me tomorrow?
-Of course l will.

353
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:02,372
-Night.
-Good night.

354
00:38:46,761 --> 00:38:49,252
Remember what i toid you, guys. Go easy.

355
00:39:31,105 --> 00:39:32,595
Okay, not too fast.

356
00:39:48,422 --> 00:39:50,253
Check it out, guy. Look over there.

357
00:39:51,759 --> 00:39:53,488
Do it again, man!

358
00:40:55,656 --> 00:40:57,590
When you`re ready, Tyler. Let`s do it.

359
00:41:17,578 --> 00:41:20,046
Not too far. Keep your iine.

360
00:41:31,492 --> 00:41:34,086
-You have a cig, brother?
-You`re right, he`s good.

361
00:41:48,109 --> 00:41:52,443
Hello? Dean?

362
00:41:56,651 --> 00:41:57,640
Hello?

363
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:16,236
lt was about this same time of year
that that storm finally broke.

364
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:21,271
-lt was deep winter.
-You were Randy Klein`s guide.

365
00:42:23,177 --> 00:42:28,114
No, l was his partner.
Just like you and cowboy.

366
00:42:31,018 --> 00:42:35,250
Yeah, conditions were great that day. Cold.

367
00:42:36,924 --> 00:42:40,155
We weren`t even a quarter of the way
down that mountain

368
00:42:41,696 --> 00:42:46,633
before all hell broke loose. Only thing
l could do was just stand there.

369
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:52,434
l watched the whole damn avi
just come down right past me with him in it.

370
00:42:57,411 --> 00:43:00,869
l`ll tell you something,
there really hasn`t been a day that`s gone by

371
00:43:00,948 --> 00:43:06,511
when l haven`t wondered,
why him and not me?

372
00:43:11,759 --> 00:43:13,090
l`m sorry.

373
00:43:14,061 --> 00:43:19,693
That`s easy for you to say.
l dug a lot of people out from up there.

374
00:43:21,669 --> 00:43:23,466
Maybe one too many.

375
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:43,913
That is 76 points. Baby, read `em and weep.

376
00:43:43,991 --> 00:43:46,892
``Jackball?`` That`s not a word.

377
00:43:47,128 --> 00:43:49,528
-Yeah, it is.
-Dude.

378
00:43:50,865 --> 00:43:56,497
-l think l found us a better line.
-Jackball, jackball. Like, ``You jackball.

379
00:43:56,570 --> 00:43:59,038
``You jerk.`` Jackball. That`s 76 points.

380
00:43:59,106 --> 00:44:01,370
-No way. You`re a cheat.
-And...

381
00:44:01,442 --> 00:44:04,536
l quit, jackball.

382
00:44:04,612 --> 00:44:09,549
Oh, no, you didn`t. You`re going
to your room? l`ll see you later.

383
00:44:11,051 --> 00:44:14,179
Check this out. l don`t know
why l didn`t notice it before but...

384
00:44:14,255 --> 00:44:18,248
Ty. We got our line.
Straight down the southwest shoulder,

385
00:44:18,325 --> 00:44:21,624
-40 yards straight line...
-Then 100 feet to nowhere.

386
00:44:21,695 --> 00:44:23,356
Dude, it`s a good line except to that area.

387
00:44:23,431 --> 00:44:24,921
You just don`t know
where you`re gonna land.

388
00:44:24,999 --> 00:44:29,129
Look, check it out. lt`s the same shoulder
but just a little bit to the left, right?

389
00:44:29,203 --> 00:44:32,798
You cut half at least off that drop
and you know where you`re gonna land

390
00:44:32,873 --> 00:44:33,999
and it`s not a postage stamp.

391
00:44:34,074 --> 00:44:36,406
Dude, you don`t know
what you`re talking about.

392
00:44:36,911 --> 00:44:39,903
Listen, l just ran it by Dean
and he thinks it`s solid.

393
00:44:42,983 --> 00:44:44,678
You and Dean?

394
00:44:46,954 --> 00:44:49,855
Whatever, man. Look, l didn`t come here
to play freaking patty cake.

395
00:44:49,924 --> 00:44:52,085
My line is straight down the middle.

396
00:45:08,742 --> 00:45:11,267
Yeah, there`s a good ianding zone
just up ahead.

397
00:45:14,748 --> 00:45:18,411
Oh, shit. We got the Frenchies here.

398
00:45:21,755 --> 00:45:23,780
Yeah, yeah. Bon bioody jour.

399
00:45:24,859 --> 00:45:27,919
Those guys beat us to the top of Meteorite,
Dean can forget about his bonus.

400
00:45:44,245 --> 00:45:47,772
Every aspect of these layers
is subject to conditions.

401
00:45:48,716 --> 00:45:51,344
-Look at this rain crust.
-Here?

402
00:45:51,418 --> 00:45:55,684
Yeah. A little bit up there,
but this is the big one.

403
00:45:55,823 --> 00:45:59,020
Hey, guys. We`re burning dayiight here.
What`s the hoid up?

404
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:01,451
Jump with your feet flat.

405
00:46:05,699 --> 00:46:08,668
-What are you doing, Dean?
-Listen, Dean,

406
00:46:09,303 --> 00:46:11,328
l really think Stephan wants us to...

407
00:46:12,806 --> 00:46:15,798
l just figured since he`s paying
for this expedition and all.

408
00:46:19,346 --> 00:46:20,438
Right.

409
00:46:20,514 --> 00:46:21,947
ls it safe?

410
00:46:25,185 --> 00:46:26,948
l don`t know if l`d go that far.

411
00:46:29,056 --> 00:46:31,388
-Let`s go.
-l think l got it, boss.

412
00:46:31,692 --> 00:46:34,217
No, no, no.
We got this shot 100 times, guys.

413
00:46:35,396 --> 00:46:38,991
l think up here. That`s the money shot.

414
00:46:44,805 --> 00:46:48,764
-Let`s work, guys. i`m starting to tighten up.
-Hang tight.

415
00:46:49,076 --> 00:46:50,304
Looks aii right to me.

416
00:46:50,377 --> 00:46:54,711
Weii, it`s not. it`s just sitting there
waiting for some fooi to try it.

417
00:46:55,783 --> 00:46:57,114
Yeah, yeah.

418
00:46:58,619 --> 00:47:00,553
Don`t even think about it, Tyler.

419
00:47:03,724 --> 00:47:05,954
l mean, that`s the money shot right there,
okay?

420
00:47:06,026 --> 00:47:08,358
Get the door. Get the door.

421
00:47:11,031 --> 00:47:12,464
What is he doing?

422
00:47:33,487 --> 00:47:38,720
Okay. That`s it. Pack it in. You`re aii done.

423
00:47:50,738 --> 00:47:53,605
lt was a nice call out there today.
You saved my ass.

424
00:47:54,742 --> 00:47:58,178
-Just doing my job.
-Thank you.

425
00:48:01,015 --> 00:48:03,279
Would`ve made
a hell of a shot though, huh?

426
00:48:04,551 --> 00:48:08,647
That`s all you kids think about nowadays
is the shot, the shot, the shot, the shot.

427
00:48:10,324 --> 00:48:12,918
Nobody even comes up here to ski anymore.

428
00:48:13,961 --> 00:48:16,452
-That`s a little unfair.
-Why?

429
00:48:16,797 --> 00:48:18,526
lt`s not like it`s a choice.

430
00:48:18,599 --> 00:48:21,466
Do you think guys like me and Mark could
afford to come up here and do all this

431
00:48:21,535 --> 00:48:22,695
if somebody wasn`t footing the bill?

432
00:48:22,770 --> 00:48:24,203
l have no idea.

433
00:48:24,271 --> 00:48:25,363
Besides, from what l understand,

434
00:48:25,439 --> 00:48:28,602
you`re looking at a pretty fat bonus yourself
after Thursday.

435
00:48:28,676 --> 00:48:31,736
-ls that what you heard?
-What, no bonus?

436
00:48:34,014 --> 00:48:35,481
No Meteorite.

437
00:48:43,691 --> 00:48:46,990
Everywhere you see orange is
an indication of low pressure.

438
00:48:47,494 --> 00:48:50,019
Any time you see red on the top there,

439
00:48:50,097 --> 00:48:53,328
you can bet we`re in
for about three to four foot of snow.

440
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:54,594
Great.

441
00:48:56,003 --> 00:48:59,734
You might as well get comfy, guys,
`cause we`re in for a whiteout.

442
00:49:01,375 --> 00:49:05,072
-How long, Dean?
-l don`t know, three to four days down.

443
00:49:05,379 --> 00:49:07,472
Could be as much as a week.

444
00:49:07,548 --> 00:49:10,574
And then again, once we get up there,
we gotta wait for the snow to stabilize.

445
00:49:10,651 --> 00:49:14,849
-Jesus.
-lt`s not Jesus, it`s Mother Nature, son.

446
00:49:15,489 --> 00:49:17,548
So, when do you think
this storm`s gonna hit?

447
00:49:19,126 --> 00:49:21,321
l don`t know, maybe late morning.

448
00:49:21,862 --> 00:49:24,296
Okay, cool. So, we get up there first thing,
we beat the storm, right?

449
00:49:24,364 --> 00:49:25,797
Meteorite, baby.

450
00:49:28,702 --> 00:49:31,865
l thought you guys said
that you wanted to do this right.

451
00:49:32,339 --> 00:49:36,070
Yeah, we do. But we don`t have
the luxury of time, you know that.

452
00:49:36,610 --> 00:49:39,272
Every day`s costing me thousands.
A week, two weeks? You`re kidding me.

453
00:49:39,346 --> 00:49:41,541
We got nothing, we`re done. No movie.

454
00:49:41,682 --> 00:49:44,173
Come on, you gotta take us up tomorrow.

455
00:49:46,787 --> 00:49:49,984
-You ain`t ready.
-No, no. Are you kidding me?

456
00:49:50,791 --> 00:49:53,157
These guys have completed
every training run you`ve thrown at them.

457
00:49:53,227 --> 00:49:56,219
They`ve dug more ditches
than l wanna look at.

458
00:49:56,730 --> 00:49:58,254
Trust me, they`re as ready
as they`re gonna be.

459
00:49:58,332 --> 00:50:00,766
Oh, so, you want me to trust you?

460
00:50:01,001 --> 00:50:03,561
lf l would have done that this morning,
he`d be dead.

461
00:50:03,704 --> 00:50:05,968
Dean, come on. l know we`re ready.

462
00:50:06,039 --> 00:50:07,973
-Ty, tell him.
-Yeah, tell me.

463
00:50:08,041 --> 00:50:10,271
-Ty.
-You ain`t ready. Shut up.

464
00:50:13,747 --> 00:50:17,308
-Ty?
-What? Yeah. l mean...

465
00:50:27,361 --> 00:50:28,419
Okay, you guys.

466
00:50:28,495 --> 00:50:31,862
Yeah, baby. Bring it on. Come on, man.

467
00:51:00,561 --> 00:51:02,028
He knew.

468
00:51:10,971 --> 00:51:12,336
Hey, Dean.

469
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:14,468
Dean.

470
00:51:15,375 --> 00:51:17,206
l was wondering, you know.

471
00:51:17,277 --> 00:51:20,269
You know, maybe, just maybe if, you know,

472
00:51:20,347 --> 00:51:22,611
if we hadn`t been dicking around
for the last six days,

473
00:51:22,683 --> 00:51:23,741
maybe we`d have the mountain in the can.

474
00:51:23,817 --> 00:51:26,513
How do you feel about that, huh? Huh?

475
00:51:32,826 --> 00:51:35,317
Great, this is bullshit.

476
00:51:36,563 --> 00:51:38,463
This is bullshit, Dean.

477
00:51:57,184 --> 00:51:59,584
Another? You go.

478
00:51:59,653 --> 00:52:01,883
-Come on.
-l`m tired, man.

479
00:52:01,955 --> 00:52:02,979
Let`s go!

480
00:52:34,922 --> 00:52:36,913
lsn`t it a little early for that?

481
00:52:39,259 --> 00:52:40,749
What`s one beer?

482
00:52:42,029 --> 00:52:44,930
What`s one beer when it`s 1 1 :00 a.m.

483
00:52:44,998 --> 00:52:48,434
and you spent
the whole night up drinking tequila?

484
00:52:50,704 --> 00:52:55,573
Dude, we`re in Alaska and it`s
freaking nuking outside and l`m thirsty.

485
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:09,621
l don`t know.
l`d say it`s a tossup at this point.

486
00:53:09,690 --> 00:53:12,056
Man, your head is as foggy as your lens is
half the time.

487
00:53:12,125 --> 00:53:14,150
Look at Tyler here on Little Crooked.

488
00:53:14,227 --> 00:53:18,891
And that straight line on Rayburn`s Peak?
You see that?

489
00:53:18,966 --> 00:53:22,197
Tyler`s clearly got more style, man,
more flow.

490
00:53:22,269 --> 00:53:25,534
Steph will definitely give him first descent.
Watch.

491
00:53:25,605 --> 00:53:27,470
l still say it`s a tossup.

492
00:53:27,541 --> 00:53:30,840
Man, that`s cabin fever talking, man.
Get back to work.

493
00:53:30,911 --> 00:53:33,436
What are we gonna do with your footage?

494
00:53:43,857 --> 00:53:48,726
Can`t find steeps like this
anywhere in the world.

495
00:53:56,903 --> 00:53:59,030
No, l`m good. Thanks.

496
00:54:00,974 --> 00:54:03,738
So, what`s the longest
you guys have ever been down for?

497
00:54:03,810 --> 00:54:08,941
We arrived end of February.
We do not see sun until April.

498
00:54:09,016 --> 00:54:11,416
-April?
-Yo, let me hit that, man.

499
00:54:14,221 --> 00:54:15,916
Okay, he went...

500
00:54:16,289 --> 00:54:20,555
-Dude, what are you doing?
-What does it look like l`m doing, man?

501
00:54:20,627 --> 00:54:24,461
Taking a B with my boys here.
Got a problem with that, man?

502
00:54:47,087 --> 00:54:48,349
You okay?

503
00:54:51,258 --> 00:54:56,025
-Yeah, l`m okay. l`m fine.
-You don`t sound fine.

504
00:54:58,865 --> 00:55:04,565
No, l`m just... l`m pulling my hair out.

505
00:55:04,638 --> 00:55:07,505
l`m getting a little stir crazy, you know.

506
00:55:08,275 --> 00:55:11,369
Well, if it`s any consolation,
the weather here has been sick

507
00:55:11,445 --> 00:55:13,970
and l won`t even tell you about the snow.

508
00:55:14,047 --> 00:55:17,414
Oh, great. l mean,
that does make me feel a lot better. Thanks.

509
00:55:19,619 --> 00:55:24,989
You know, he hasn`t called or written
me once, not even to just say hello.

510
00:55:26,226 --> 00:55:28,057
That`s weird,
`cause he talks about you all the time.

511
00:55:28,128 --> 00:55:31,222
Oh, come on, Tyler,
please don`t stick up for him.

512
00:55:31,298 --> 00:55:35,530
No. He hasn`t really been himself lately.

513
00:55:35,602 --> 00:55:38,730
You know, since... Since you and l...

514
00:55:41,975 --> 00:55:43,101
What?

515
00:55:44,511 --> 00:55:46,342
Never mind, forget it. lt`s stupid.

516
00:55:46,413 --> 00:55:50,076
So, what are we supposed to do?
Break up because of him?

517
00:55:50,150 --> 00:55:51,640
l don`t know.

518
00:55:52,052 --> 00:55:54,782
You don`t really wanna end this, do you?

519
00:55:57,557 --> 00:55:59,354
l`ll call you later.

520
00:56:09,402 --> 00:56:11,734
Man, you guys really do suck.

521
00:56:12,472 --> 00:56:16,272
-Oh, come on. Come on.
-Yo!

522
00:56:17,511 --> 00:56:20,344
Mr. Crowe, as always,
your timing is impeccable.

523
00:56:20,413 --> 00:56:21,710
Come on, man. Why don`t you join me here?

524
00:56:21,781 --> 00:56:23,908
-Dude, we gotta talk.
-Be my partner for a game.

525
00:56:23,984 --> 00:56:27,249
-l got to talk to you now.
-Now is not a good time.

526
00:56:29,256 --> 00:56:32,157
-Hey, what the hell are you doing?
-Come on.

527
00:56:43,203 --> 00:56:44,295
What?

528
00:56:48,241 --> 00:56:52,678
-Let`s go home, man.
-What? You crazy?

529
00:56:52,746 --> 00:56:55,044
l just...
l don`t think we gave this enough thought

530
00:56:55,115 --> 00:56:58,482
and l don`t think anybody`s gonna think
anything less of us if we leave now.

531
00:56:58,552 --> 00:57:01,248
Ty, l came here for Meteorite, man.

532
00:57:01,321 --> 00:57:03,949
l know you did.

533
00:57:04,024 --> 00:57:06,925
But it`s not worth it. lt`s not worth this.

534
00:57:11,698 --> 00:57:15,361
l see.
You`re trying to psych me out, is that it?

535
00:57:17,304 --> 00:57:18,862
What are you talking about, psych you out?

536
00:57:18,939 --> 00:57:20,702
Know what?
Don`t even try and deny it, all right?

537
00:57:20,774 --> 00:57:22,401
Everybody knows.

538
00:57:22,509 --> 00:57:26,912
Trying to steal my thunder,
my line, my mountain. Come on.

539
00:57:26,980 --> 00:57:29,608
-Dude, you invited me here.
-Yeah.

540
00:57:29,683 --> 00:57:33,619
Yeah, biggest mistake l ever made.

541
00:57:33,687 --> 00:57:36,884
-You want first descent...
-Dude, you are out of your mind.

542
00:57:36,957 --> 00:57:39,323
-Where is this all coming from?
-All right.

543
00:57:41,695 --> 00:57:46,064
You`re a taker, dude. You always have been.

544
00:57:46,166 --> 00:57:50,102
-Look how you`re handling my little sister.
-Handling your little sister.

545
00:57:50,170 --> 00:57:52,570
l knew that`s what this was about.

546
00:57:52,772 --> 00:57:56,538
You may think you can fool her, man,
but not me.

547
00:57:56,610 --> 00:57:58,601
l see how you really are.

548
00:58:03,083 --> 00:58:06,382
-l`m out of here, man.
-Don`t let the door hit you.

549
00:58:08,188 --> 00:58:10,213
What happened to you, man?

550
00:58:47,694 --> 00:58:49,059
lt`s good.

551
00:58:50,363 --> 00:58:51,455
Yeah.

552
00:58:58,471 --> 00:58:59,870
Tyler Crowe.

553
00:59:03,043 --> 00:59:05,511
To what do l owe his honor?

554
00:59:05,578 --> 00:59:10,208
l`ve been snowed in a while
and l`m itching to let them run.

555
00:59:10,283 --> 00:59:11,682
Have a seat.

556
00:59:17,891 --> 00:59:21,292
Looks like one hell of a training course
you got set up out there.

557
00:59:21,361 --> 00:59:25,525
Yeah, it is.
lt`s about as technical as they get.

558
00:59:31,671 --> 00:59:35,732
What would it take for a guy
to get a run down it?

559
00:59:35,809 --> 00:59:38,607
Well, it`s not open to the public, Tyler.

560
00:59:41,681 --> 00:59:42,841
Right.

561
00:59:47,253 --> 00:59:49,016
Well, l guess...

562
00:59:50,590 --> 00:59:52,182
You got one run.

563
00:59:54,060 --> 00:59:57,188
That`s all l need, Coach.

564
00:59:57,263 --> 00:59:58,491
Suit up.

565
01:00:20,754 --> 01:00:24,417
Morning, sunshine. We got bluebird.
Come on, get up, kid.

566
01:00:24,524 --> 01:00:27,084
Come on, get up, get up, get up, get up.
Coffee`s getting cold. Come on.

567
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:30,095
-You got to be kidding me.
-Meteorite awaits.

568
01:03:32,245 --> 01:03:34,839
Three, two...

569
01:06:11,003 --> 01:06:14,700
You`re not gonna beiieve it.
Tyler Crowe, 1.:38, 1.:38.

570
01:06:14,774 --> 01:06:17,140
He just beat Jones by almost two seconds.

571
01:06:17,677 --> 01:06:19,770
Book another ticket to Chamonix.

572
01:06:33,159 --> 01:06:34,251
Mark.

573
01:06:35,962 --> 01:06:37,054
Mark.

574
01:06:39,198 --> 01:06:41,598
Dean? Dean, do you have a visuai?

575
01:06:44,971 --> 01:06:46,905
Mark? Do you hear me, Mark?

576
01:06:46,973 --> 01:06:50,773
Oh, Jesus. Jesus. Mark!

577
01:07:06,392 --> 01:07:07,950
You have two messages.

578
01:07:11,230 --> 01:07:16,327
Tyler, where are you?
Something`s happened to Mark.

579
01:07:16,402 --> 01:07:19,963
i don`t know what`s going on.
Will you just call me, please? Call me.

580
01:07:31,984 --> 01:07:33,815
Hey, Tyler.

581
01:07:33,886 --> 01:07:35,285
-Hey.
-Hey.

582
01:07:36,689 --> 01:07:38,657
Sorry about your friend.

583
01:07:45,364 --> 01:07:48,959
You gotta keep moving.

584
01:07:49,035 --> 01:07:52,994
Mourn his loss, but don`t lose focus
on what you`re here for.

585
01:08:01,214 --> 01:08:04,741
Today`s the best you`ve ever skied.

586
01:08:04,817 --> 01:08:08,082
Listen, l appreciate that.

587
01:08:09,322 --> 01:08:13,315
And l`ll catch up with you guys
just as soon as l can, all right?

588
01:08:16,295 --> 01:08:20,026
l had to pull a lot of strings
to get you back on the team.

589
01:08:21,634 --> 01:08:23,534
-l know you did.
-Okay.

590
01:08:25,905 --> 01:08:29,966
You know, if you walk away now, that`s it.
There`s no coming back.

591
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:56,595
Father, we thank you for Mark`s life.

592
01:08:56,669 --> 01:09:00,696
We thank you, God, and we celebrate
what`s happened in his life today.

593
01:09:00,773 --> 01:09:02,673
We celebrate what we have had,

594
01:09:02,742 --> 01:09:06,678
and again we thank you
that someday we shall see him again.

595
01:09:06,746 --> 01:09:08,407
We say this in Jesus` name.

596
01:09:08,481 --> 01:09:12,281
ln the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit, amen.

597
01:10:06,539 --> 01:10:07,563
Hi.

598
01:10:14,380 --> 01:10:16,348
How could you leave him?

599
01:10:19,485 --> 01:10:21,476
He wasn`t supposed to go.

600
01:10:27,059 --> 01:10:31,052
Look, l don`t know what l wanna say to you

601
01:10:31,130 --> 01:10:35,328
because, honestly, l don`t know
how l feel about anything anymore.

602
01:10:37,737 --> 01:10:40,865
All l know is my brother is dead
and that you...

603
01:10:43,275 --> 01:10:47,109
And that l what?

604
01:10:47,179 --> 01:10:50,444
Say it, Elisa. l wanna hear you say it.

605
01:10:52,685 --> 01:10:56,416
And that it`s my fault. Say it, Elisa.

606
01:11:28,554 --> 01:11:30,112
Hello, Tyler.

607
01:11:30,689 --> 01:11:33,920
-What do you want?
-Do you have a second?

608
01:11:50,476 --> 01:11:54,037
Look, l know you think
l coaxed him up there too soon.

609
01:11:54,113 --> 01:11:57,344
Truth is, he wanted to fly
first sign of bluebird.

610
01:11:58,818 --> 01:12:00,513
You get four feet of fresh powder
with a storm.

611
01:12:00,586 --> 01:12:04,022
-You know how Mark was.
-lf there`s a point, get to it.

612
01:12:05,758 --> 01:12:10,627
You`re angry, l get it.
And if it helps blaming me, l understand.

613
01:12:24,176 --> 01:12:26,406
l never should have left him.

614
01:12:28,481 --> 01:12:30,881
You`re right, you shouldn`t have.

615
01:12:31,117 --> 01:12:33,017
You turned your back on him.

616
01:12:33,085 --> 01:12:38,990
-This project, your contract...
-My contract, is that why you`re here?

617
01:12:40,059 --> 01:12:41,856
l need you up there.

618
01:12:44,897 --> 01:12:46,922
l mean, you`re just sitting here.

619
01:12:46,999 --> 01:12:50,025
Winter is almost over,
you`re just getting colder.

620
01:12:50,102 --> 01:12:53,833
-Are you gonna let the mountain win?
-ls this some kind of game to you?

621
01:12:55,741 --> 01:13:00,838
l`m not gonna let my best friend`s death be
some convenient plot twist in your movie.

622
01:13:02,281 --> 01:13:04,545
-Okay.
-Get out of my house.

623
01:13:05,784 --> 01:13:07,809
You know where to find me.

624
01:13:15,394 --> 01:13:19,956
Tyler. Tyler.

625
01:13:22,134 --> 01:13:27,094
Tyler! Tyler!

626
01:13:30,075 --> 01:13:33,636
-Tyler!
-Mark?

627
01:13:35,948 --> 01:13:37,779
-Tyler. Tyler!
-Mark!

628
01:13:40,052 --> 01:13:41,349
Tyler!

629
01:13:41,754 --> 01:13:44,723
Mark! Mark! Hold on!

630
01:13:59,138 --> 01:14:00,230
God!

631
01:15:10,342 --> 01:15:11,969
Glad you made it.

632
01:15:32,965 --> 01:15:35,058
So, how much did you get?

633
01:15:35,634 --> 01:15:38,262
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

634
01:15:38,337 --> 01:15:41,465
What was the price tag
on my best friend`s life?

635
01:15:43,442 --> 01:15:46,707
-There wasn`t a price tag.
-``There wasn`t a price tag``?

636
01:15:46,779 --> 01:15:49,475
You told me you weren`t taking us up there.
You told me you weren`t ready...

637
01:15:49,548 --> 01:15:54,952
Your bullshit stories about your best friend
dying and feeling guilty, and l believed you.

638
01:15:55,854 --> 01:15:59,790
-And l left him here.
-He was gonna go with somebody else, man.

639
01:16:00,859 --> 01:16:02,349
God damn it!

640
01:16:04,096 --> 01:16:07,122
He had somebody else.
He was going with somebody else, man.

641
01:16:07,199 --> 01:16:09,929
l was the best chance that he had, okay?

642
01:16:12,504 --> 01:16:15,439
-He didn`t take his line?
-No, he took yours.

643
01:16:16,942 --> 01:16:18,603
He took your line.

644
01:16:21,980 --> 01:16:23,607
l wanna go there.

645
01:16:24,950 --> 01:16:26,247
All right.

646
01:16:26,318 --> 01:16:29,344
-Will you take me?
-Yeah.

647
01:16:38,697 --> 01:16:41,188
When that mountain calls your name,

648
01:16:43,135 --> 01:16:45,569
baby, you`re done. That`s it, man.

649
01:16:47,806 --> 01:16:49,797
The way l see it,
he could have run off the end of a cliff

650
01:16:49,908 --> 01:16:53,105
or tried to outrun an avalanche. Either way,

651
01:16:56,582 --> 01:16:59,142
l guess it wasn`t meant to work out.

652
01:17:00,552 --> 01:17:02,645
Your line was solid, Tyler.

653
01:17:04,523 --> 01:17:06,150
lt wasn`t his.

654
01:17:09,628 --> 01:17:12,062
That was the thing about Mark, you know?

655
01:17:12,131 --> 01:17:16,932
He never would be told what to do

656
01:17:17,002 --> 01:17:20,563
and it just kind of sucks
that the one time he listens to me...

657
01:17:22,608 --> 01:17:26,567
There`s nothing anybody could have done,
short of not going up there.

658
01:17:26,645 --> 01:17:31,275
l`m telling you, death is always
around the corner. Yes, it is, my friend.

659
01:17:31,517 --> 01:17:33,644
Can l see those Polaroids?

660
01:17:34,052 --> 01:17:36,646
-l`m not gonna show them to you.
-Why is that?

661
01:17:36,722 --> 01:17:40,783
Because she`s not gonna look
nothing like that once you get up there.

662
01:17:40,859 --> 01:17:43,054
lt`s gonna be
completely and totally different.

663
01:17:43,128 --> 01:17:46,325
l`m gonna be your eyes, okay?
lf there`s any snow coming your way,

664
01:17:46,398 --> 01:17:50,858
you`re gonna know where it`s coming from
and how to get out of the way.

665
01:17:50,936 --> 01:17:55,032
l promise you that.
Man, l`m sorry about what happened.

666
01:18:39,618 --> 01:18:44,248
-Hey.
-Yeah, l got your note.

667
01:19:00,439 --> 01:19:02,634
He died the way he wanted to.

668
01:19:06,678 --> 01:19:08,043
l miss him.

669
01:19:10,115 --> 01:19:11,912
l miss him so much.

670
01:19:13,685 --> 01:19:15,277
l miss him, too.

671
01:19:16,522 --> 01:19:18,353
l`m sorry l left him.

672
01:19:19,258 --> 01:19:21,692
This wasn`t your fault,
and you don`t have to do this.

673
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:25,287
-Please, just come home.
-Listen, l owe it to him.

674
01:19:25,364 --> 01:19:28,458
l already lost a brother.
l cannot lose you, too. l won`t.

675
01:19:28,534 --> 01:19:32,026
We made a pact
that we were gonna do Meteorite and...

676
01:19:34,773 --> 01:19:36,764
And he`s still up there.

677
01:19:40,312 --> 01:19:41,973
l gotta finish it.

678
01:19:52,758 --> 01:19:56,057
l guess you`re gonna have to make room
for one more.

679
01:20:05,671 --> 01:20:07,798
-Hey, Dean.
-Yeah.

680
01:20:07,873 --> 01:20:11,240
-You share some poison?
-Okay.

681
01:20:20,485 --> 01:20:21,884
Here you go.

682
01:20:27,759 --> 01:20:29,727
So, how did it go today?

683
01:20:31,563 --> 01:20:34,327
Pretty good. Pretty good.
A little preparation time.

684
01:20:34,399 --> 01:20:36,333
Everything went fine.

685
01:20:37,235 --> 01:20:41,035
l hate to tell you this,
but there`s another storm coming in.

686
01:20:45,010 --> 01:20:48,707
You know l`m one run away
from finishing this movie, huh?

687
01:20:49,615 --> 01:20:51,606
l need you to get Tyler up there
tomorrow morning.

688
01:20:53,018 --> 01:20:56,545
You know,
l don`t wanna hear he`s not ready, either.

689
01:20:56,622 --> 01:21:00,149
l`m not gonna say that `cause he is ready.

690
01:21:00,225 --> 01:21:03,524
-But if the conditions aren`t right...
-Conditions?

691
01:21:04,262 --> 01:21:08,130
ls that...
ls that what this is all about? Conditions?

692
01:21:08,367 --> 01:21:09,356
`Cause you know what l think it`s about?

693
01:21:09,434 --> 01:21:13,234
l think it`s about money. l think you flew him
out that day because you needed the cash.

694
01:21:13,305 --> 01:21:16,604
l think it`s more about the decisions
that were made.

695
01:21:16,675 --> 01:21:20,941
-A decision that cost Mark his life.
-That`s bullshit. Mark knew the risks.

696
01:21:21,013 --> 01:21:22,605
He wasn`t ready.

697
01:21:27,919 --> 01:21:30,080
You are under contract, Dean.

698
01:21:31,323 --> 01:21:34,486
So, let`s conclude
our business tomorrow, okay?

699
01:21:35,394 --> 01:21:36,588
Cheers.

700
01:21:40,432 --> 01:21:42,059
See you at 7:00.

701
01:22:02,454 --> 01:22:03,580
What?

702
01:22:06,291 --> 01:22:07,815
What? Tell me.

703
01:22:11,530 --> 01:22:12,895
Nothing.

704
01:22:14,132 --> 01:22:16,862
l`m just happy you`re here, that`s all.

705
01:22:29,948 --> 01:22:31,347
-Hey.
-What?

706
01:22:34,419 --> 01:22:38,378
lt`s just you`re gonna need
your energy for tomorrow.

707
01:22:47,566 --> 01:22:50,228
-All right.
-Keep packing.

708
01:23:13,258 --> 01:23:15,886
-There`s been a change of plans.
-What?

709
01:23:17,796 --> 01:23:23,462
Meet me outside in 15 minutes
and you`ll find out. All right?

710
01:23:29,374 --> 01:23:30,636
Come on.

711
01:23:36,982 --> 01:23:37,971
Okay.

712
01:24:21,293 --> 01:24:24,456
-Where are they going?
-They ditched us, Steph.

713
01:25:44,776 --> 01:25:46,539
Stay with me, buddy.

714
01:25:51,082 --> 01:25:53,550
Listen, kid, i hate to teii you this,

715
01:25:53,618 --> 01:25:56,143
but we gotta be off this mountain
in 20 minutes.

716
01:25:56,221 --> 01:25:58,121
There`s a storm coming.

717
01:26:11,403 --> 01:26:13,530
Ty, don`t forget,

718
01:26:14,105 --> 01:26:16,403

719
01:26:17,542 --> 01:26:19,203
Let`s finish this.

720
01:26:20,545 --> 01:26:22,570
Okay, kid. it`s aii yours.

721
01:26:23,815 --> 01:26:25,840
On three. One, two, three.

722
01:26:54,045 --> 01:26:56,036
Aii right, take it easy.

723
01:27:19,738 --> 01:27:21,968
Hug the rib. Hug the rib.

724
01:27:34,886 --> 01:27:38,447
We`ve got a iot of snow moving aiready.
Cut right.

725
01:27:38,523 --> 01:27:40,388
Let your siough go by.

726
01:27:43,661 --> 01:27:46,789
Get the hell out of there!
She`s coming apart!

727
01:27:48,833 --> 01:27:50,061
Now, hang in there.

728
01:27:52,470 --> 01:27:54,597
Where is he? Where did he go?

729
01:28:00,111 --> 01:28:01,339
There.

730
01:28:05,950 --> 01:28:07,747
Let the siough go by.

731
01:28:26,838 --> 01:28:28,703
Tyler, are you all right?

732
01:28:28,773 --> 01:28:30,968
-i`m fine.
-You`re done, pai.

733
01:28:31,042 --> 01:28:33,772
-We`re coming in to get you.
-What?

734
01:28:33,845 --> 01:28:35,005
it`s time to ball.

735
01:28:35,080 --> 01:28:37,071
l thought you said you were
my eyes on this?

736
01:28:37,148 --> 01:28:40,743
We`re coming in whether you like it or not.

737
01:28:40,885 --> 01:28:45,151
l need you, Rider. What do l do, man?
What do l do?

738
01:28:47,859 --> 01:28:51,226
Dean, is that Mark`s line directly below me?

739
01:28:51,296 --> 01:28:53,958
Forget it, you`re done, we`re coming in.

740
01:28:54,032 --> 01:28:55,966
-ls it or isn`t it?
-Yes.

741
01:28:56,034 --> 01:28:58,400
Tyler, please don`t do something crazy.

742
01:28:58,470 --> 01:29:00,404
You guys got to trust me on this one.

743
01:29:00,472 --> 01:29:02,872
Don`t even think about it, Tyler.

744
01:29:04,676 --> 01:29:06,303
What`s he doing?

745
01:29:13,351 --> 01:29:15,478
Okay, kid. it`s aii yours.

746
01:29:32,604 --> 01:29:35,232
You got a 15-foot drop dead ahead.

747
01:30:02,867 --> 01:30:06,132
-Take your shot, kid.
-Please, baby, get it. Come on.

748
01:30:17,649 --> 01:30:19,082
Sweet Jesus!

749
01:30:53,084 --> 01:30:55,985
-You did it!
-We did it.

750
01:31:10,602 --> 01:31:12,092
Nice job, kid.

751
01:31:27,385 --> 01:31:30,081
Hey, kid. i`ve got a proposition for you.

752
01:31:32,290 --> 01:31:34,155
Oh, yeah? What`s that?

753
01:31:43,835 --> 01:31:48,397
You can forget everything you know
about high-elevation snow, boys.

754
01:31:48,473 --> 01:31:49,906
This is Alaska.

755
01:31:49,974 --> 01:31:53,034
8,000-foot conditions at sea level.

756
01:31:53,611 --> 01:31:59,174
Game plan for tomorrow is Fissile Peak,
6:00 a.m. pending bluebird.

757
01:31:59,584 --> 01:32:01,814
-What`s bluebird?
-Clear skies.

758
01:32:04,355 --> 01:32:08,724
-Jesus.
-No, Mother Nature.
