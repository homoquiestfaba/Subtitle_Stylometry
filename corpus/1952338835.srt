1
00:01:15,542 --> 00:01:17,703
Who cut these this morning?

2
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:18,733
Sinh's station.

3
00:01:20,146 --> 00:01:22,046
Sinh's station.

4
00:01:26,019 --> 00:01:27,247
Sinh.

5
00:01:27,287 --> 00:01:29,084
Who cut these this morning?

6
00:01:31,191 --> 00:01:32,283
Who?

7
00:01:33,393 --> 00:01:34,690
Me.

8
00:01:34,727 --> 00:01:36,490
You, Thuy?

9
00:01:36,529 --> 00:01:39,123
You measured all wrong.

10
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:42,063
25 centimeters.

11
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:44,002
You know this!

12
00:01:45,138 --> 00:01:46,537
Measure again.

13
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:55,710
How much?

14
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:00,811
20 centimeters.

15
00:02:02,088 --> 00:02:03,612
What are you going to do now?

16
00:02:03,656 --> 00:02:06,181
I have a shipment
going out tomorrow.

17
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:08,387
Where's your head?

18
00:02:08,428 --> 00:02:09,725
I'm sorry.

19
00:02:10,563 --> 00:02:12,190
You're so useless.

20
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:15,198
I'm sorry.
I'll pay for it.

21
00:02:15,235 --> 00:02:17,032
Pay with what?

22
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:19,061
Pay with what?

23
00:02:22,675 --> 00:02:23,664
Back to work!

24
00:02:25,011 --> 00:02:26,876
There's nothing to look at.

25
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:28,705
I'm so tired of you!!

26
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:36,479
Stand here and listen to me.

27
00:02:38,124 --> 00:02:40,456
You have to be more careful
with the work.

28
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:43,587
Our jobs depend on everyone
doing things right.

29
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:46,428
I'm trying to teach you
something.

30
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:47,592
Yes, Uncle.

31
00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:48,623
Do you think...

32
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:51,159
that you can survive out there
by yourself?

33
00:02:52,105 --> 00:02:53,231
I guarantee...

34
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:55,434
you wouldn't last day.

35
00:02:55,475 --> 00:02:57,636
Your mom and dad are gone.

36
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:00,345
Do you understand me?

37
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,472
Yes, Uncle.

38
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:04,108
I'm all you have now.

39
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:06,618
Don't ever forget that.

40
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:49,628
When are you coming back?

41
00:03:49,662 --> 00:03:51,152
I don't know.

42
00:03:51,197 --> 00:03:52,960
Hold on a second.

43
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,474
This is for you.

44
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:45,869
Le Le Hotel.
District 1.

45
00:05:56,622 --> 00:06:01,321
- Hey, Mr. Elephant!
- Mr. Elephant!

46
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:02,953
How old are you,
Mr. Elephant?

47
00:06:02,995 --> 00:06:04,792
How old are you?

48
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:06,355
Do you go to school,
Mr. Elephant?

49
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:07,593
Do you go to school?

50
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:08,890
How's my old friend today?

51
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:11,863
I know... I miss her too.

52
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:30,806
I don't think
she's coming back.

53
00:07:37,223 --> 00:07:39,248
It's just you and me.

54
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:51,830
- Lan!
- Hello, you two.

55
00:07:51,871 --> 00:07:53,771
- How's it going?
- Good.

56
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:56,172
- How's Hanoi?
- Same as always.

57
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:57,836
How long are you staying
this week?

58
00:07:57,877 --> 00:07:59,435
Till Friday.

59
00:08:00,446 --> 00:08:02,710
Friday? That short?

60
00:08:02,748 --> 00:08:06,684
- Can't you stay longer?
- We'll go out.

61
00:08:06,719 --> 00:08:08,744
I have to go back to work.

62
00:08:08,788 --> 00:08:10,949
Room 701, right?

63
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,321
Very good.

64
00:08:12,358 --> 00:08:13,518
Thanks again.

65
00:08:15,361 --> 00:08:16,885
Ask her.

66
00:08:16,929 --> 00:08:19,363
She wants
to ask you something.

67
00:08:19,398 --> 00:08:21,298
Just ask me.

68
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:24,394
You come here every week.

69
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:26,234
Almost two months now.

70
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:31,369
But you don't get messages
from a husband or boyfriend.

71
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:32,707
That's right.

72
00:08:32,745 --> 00:08:34,372
You're a pretty woman.

73
00:08:34,413 --> 00:08:36,881
- Very pretty.
- With a good job.

74
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:39,817
You should have
a lot of admirers.

75
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:41,877
But you're always alone.

76
00:08:41,921 --> 00:08:45,914
Maybe you're too choosy.

77
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:48,660
No one will have me.

78
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:52,723
Our cousin is really nice.

79
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:54,062
He's a real gentleman.

80
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:57,035
He has a job with the city.

81
00:08:57,069 --> 00:08:59,367
He knows magic.

82
00:08:59,405 --> 00:09:00,394
Magic?

83
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:02,907
- Yeah, he's really good at it.
- Really?

84
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:04,876
Thanks. I'm okay.

85
00:09:04,911 --> 00:09:07,709
- I'll get my suitcase upstairs.
- Of course.

86
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:10,113
Magic? Are you nuts?

87
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:11,138
He knows magic.

88
00:09:11,183 --> 00:09:13,014
He's lousy at it.

89
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:15,646
I think he's pretty good.

90
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:04,901
Hello, sir.

91
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:07,201
- What are you doing?
- Just making tea.

92
00:10:07,239 --> 00:10:08,900
Have a seat.

93
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:14,268
You need to find
a bigger place.

94
00:10:14,313 --> 00:10:16,338
You can't live like this
forever.

95
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:19,078
Thanks, but it's good enough
for me.

96
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:26,851
You know... I knew your father.

97
00:10:26,892 --> 00:10:28,325
He was a good man.

98
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:30,124
Always took care
of the animals.

99
00:10:30,162 --> 00:10:31,857
They were his family.

100
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:36,060
Please have some tea.

101
00:10:41,107 --> 00:10:43,166
Times are changing.

102
00:10:45,011 --> 00:10:47,104
The city is growing fast.

103
00:10:48,547 --> 00:10:51,482
The zoo isn't making
any money.

104
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:55,077
The operating costs
are getting high.

105
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:58,022
The zoo isn't supposed
to make money.

106
00:10:58,057 --> 00:10:59,354
I work for the interest
of the zoo.

107
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:02,088
It's my job
to bring revenue.

108
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:08,125
But I came
with good news today.

109
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:11,864
A zoo in India wants to buy
the baby elephant.

110
00:11:11,904 --> 00:11:14,134
They'll pay a good sum.

111
00:11:15,374 --> 00:11:18,002
That elephant's been here
his whole life.

112
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:21,513
This is the only home
he knows.

113
00:11:21,547 --> 00:11:24,015
He will learn to adapt.

114
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:26,211
Animals learn to adapt.

115
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:32,180
The other zoo might take
better care of him.

116
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:41,827
It's business.
You understand.

117
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:43,198
Good day.

118
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:35,553
Are you looking for work?

119
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:38,288
Do you have any money?

120
00:12:38,324 --> 00:12:39,348
40,000 dong.

121
00:12:39,391 --> 00:12:40,949
That's all.

122
00:12:40,993 --> 00:12:43,188
I spent it on the boat
to get here.

123
00:12:50,803 --> 00:12:53,169
Buy some postcards
from the woman there.

124
00:12:53,205 --> 00:12:56,641
Sell them back
for twice as much.

125
00:12:56,675 --> 00:12:58,575
That gives you 80,000.

126
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:01,580
Keep 10,000 for food.
Buy more cards with the rest.

127
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:04,139
You need money to make money.

128
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:11,115
Okay, you can go now.

129
00:13:23,502 --> 00:13:25,493
I'm sorry.

130
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:27,096
Sorry about what?

131
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:29,972
I hear things.
I know about your fiancée.

132
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,071
I'll see you on Thursday.

133
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:35,865
What do you want?

134
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:38,306
I just want to see Phuong.

135
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:39,641
She doesn't want to see you.

136
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:43,275
Who says I can't see her?

137
00:14:43,315 --> 00:14:44,907
I say it.

138
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:48,220
Listen.

139
00:14:48,254 --> 00:14:50,745
I don't want to see your face
here again.

140
00:14:50,789 --> 00:14:52,416
I'm not scared of you.

141
00:14:53,158 --> 00:14:54,420
Just remember.

142
00:16:47,106 --> 00:16:48,471
Postcards?

143
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:52,600
Postcards?

144
00:16:52,644 --> 00:16:54,134
Postcards?

145
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,019
Postcards?

146
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,699
Are you lost?

147
00:18:29,741 --> 00:18:31,038
No.

148
00:18:31,076 --> 00:18:34,045
Just waiting for someone
to take me to lunch.

149
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:37,848
If you had your wish,
what would you eat?

150
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:41,581
Pork chops on rice.
With egg rolls.

151
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:45,386
Maybe finish it off
with chocolate ice cream.

152
00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:48,325
Noodle soup!

153
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,294
Noodle soup!

154
00:18:57,035 --> 00:18:58,161
Want noodle soup?

155
00:18:58,203 --> 00:18:59,397
How much?

156
00:18:59,438 --> 00:19:01,201
5,000 a bowl.

157
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:05,976
You haven't sold
any cards today?

158
00:19:07,012 --> 00:19:08,343
Follow me.

159
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:10,678
The first one
is on the house.

160
00:19:10,716 --> 00:19:11,705
Let's go.

161
00:19:15,454 --> 00:19:17,615
Hurry up.
Don't be so proud.

162
00:19:22,761 --> 00:19:25,559
Here. Eat up.

163
00:19:33,071 --> 00:19:35,005
You from the countryside?

164
00:19:35,641 --> 00:19:37,108
Just outside the city.

165
00:19:37,142 --> 00:19:39,542
You're out of money.

166
00:19:40,445 --> 00:19:42,276
I spent it on the postcards.

167
00:19:43,315 --> 00:19:45,510
Why don't you sell roses?

168
00:19:45,551 --> 00:19:46,711
Roses?

169
00:19:46,752 --> 00:19:47,980
Yeah.

170
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,647
Lots of people buy roses.

171
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:51,918
Outside restaurants
and cafes.

172
00:19:52,758 --> 00:19:54,020
Men in the city...

173
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:56,550
like to impress women.

174
00:19:56,595 --> 00:20:00,031
If you want me to help you,
I could take you there.

175
00:20:00,065 --> 00:20:02,898
There's a woman in charge
of all the flower girls.

176
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:05,233
She's always looking
for new workers.

177
00:20:09,274 --> 00:20:11,572
Here.
Pour this in the soup.

178
00:20:16,114 --> 00:20:19,277
You sell each one for 10,000.
You keep 3,000.

179
00:20:19,318 --> 00:20:20,979
7,000 goes back to me.

180
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:23,112
Go to De Tham Street
to see the other girls.

181
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:25,123
They'll show you what to do,
okay?

182
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:26,647
Yes, ma'am.

183
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:36,867
This one looks your size.

184
00:20:46,044 --> 00:20:48,012
The roses won't be good
tomorrow.

185
00:20:48,046 --> 00:20:49,946
You have to sell
them all tonight.

186
00:20:50,682 --> 00:20:52,411
What if I can't?

187
00:20:52,451 --> 00:20:53,918
Then you go hungry.

188
00:21:04,296 --> 00:21:06,196
Fresh roses, mister.

189
00:21:06,231 --> 00:21:07,858
I'm not buying.

190
00:21:07,899 --> 00:21:10,868
Just buy one, mister.
Only 10,000 each.

191
00:21:10,902 --> 00:21:12,597
I'm not buying.

192
00:21:12,638 --> 00:21:15,471
Help me pay
for my schoolbooks, mister.

193
00:21:19,177 --> 00:21:20,701
Okay, give me one.

194
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,981
Thank you, mister.

195
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,317
You make it look easy.

196
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,920
It's easy
if you know what to say.

197
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:39,555
People feel sorry
for little girls

198
00:21:39,598 --> 00:21:40,997
if they have a story.

199
00:21:41,033 --> 00:21:42,898
Do you have a story?

200
00:21:42,934 --> 00:21:44,902
What if I can't think of one?

201
00:21:44,936 --> 00:21:47,029
You have to think of one.

202
00:21:47,773 --> 00:21:49,365
What if I can't?

203
00:21:49,408 --> 00:21:51,171
Then you go hungry.

204
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,745
Two bowls, Mom.

205
00:23:13,425 --> 00:23:14,892
You like the soup, miss?

206
00:23:14,926 --> 00:23:16,951
It's good.
Not too salty.

207
00:23:17,763 --> 00:23:19,628
That's right.
Not too salty.

208
00:23:19,664 --> 00:23:21,291
It's the best soup in town.

209
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:24,727
You'll tell your friends
to come, right?

210
00:23:37,783 --> 00:23:39,375
Fresh roses, miss?

211
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:41,147
No, thanks.

212
00:23:41,186 --> 00:23:42,778
Buy one for your husband.

213
00:23:44,022 --> 00:23:45,250
I don't have a husband.

214
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:47,087
Then for your boyfriend.

215
00:23:49,461 --> 00:23:50,928
I don't have a boyfriend.

216
00:23:56,535 --> 00:23:58,298
How many
have you sold tonight?

217
00:23:58,336 --> 00:24:01,100
It's my first night
on the job.

218
00:24:01,139 --> 00:24:05,200
I didn't have a story
to tell people.

219
00:24:05,243 --> 00:24:07,302
But now I do.

220
00:24:08,547 --> 00:24:10,139
What do you tell them?

221
00:24:10,182 --> 00:24:12,480
I tell them
it's my birthday.

222
00:24:13,151 --> 00:24:14,778
And it's not your birthday?

223
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:18,256
My birthday's next month.

224
00:24:19,491 --> 00:24:21,118
You shouldn't tell lies.

225
00:24:21,827 --> 00:24:23,692
You try selling roses
on the streets.

226
00:24:28,733 --> 00:24:29,825
Want some noodle soup?

227
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:33,134
Another bowl of soup here!

228
00:24:36,708 --> 00:24:38,403
I'll take two roses.

229
00:24:39,177 --> 00:24:41,577
I thought you said
you didn't have a boyfriend.

230
00:24:43,215 --> 00:24:44,876
You need the business.

231
00:24:48,353 --> 00:24:49,786
Thanks again.

232
00:25:27,292 --> 00:25:29,954
Good day.

233
00:25:31,129 --> 00:25:33,859
Seen this girl
around the neighborhood?

234
00:25:33,899 --> 00:25:36,800
No, sir.

235
00:25:36,835 --> 00:25:38,996
Are you sure?

236
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:40,368
Thanks anyway.

237
00:25:53,351 --> 00:25:56,616
Hello, girls.
Can you help me?

238
00:25:56,655 --> 00:26:00,250
Have you seen this girl
around the neighborhood?

239
00:26:00,292 --> 00:26:01,589
No, sir.

240
00:26:02,694 --> 00:26:03,922
Are you sure?

241
00:26:16,975 --> 00:26:19,170
Noodle soup, anyone?

242
00:26:23,148 --> 00:26:24,775
Seen this girl around?

243
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:29,985
Not her.

244
00:26:31,523 --> 00:26:33,115
Are you sure?

245
00:26:33,158 --> 00:26:34,386
I'm sure.

246
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:36,792
I know all the girls
in the neighborhood.

247
00:26:36,828 --> 00:26:38,591
I've never seen this one.

248
00:26:39,698 --> 00:26:41,666
- You're not lying to me?
- No, sir.

249
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:44,163
Want some yummy noodle soup?

250
00:27:37,122 --> 00:27:38,214
Little girl!

251
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:40,648
Don't feed it that!

252
00:27:44,396 --> 00:27:46,387
Elephants like sugarcane.

253
00:27:53,638 --> 00:27:55,765
Little kids like to feed it
sugarcane.

254
00:27:56,641 --> 00:27:58,074
Go ahead and feed it.

255
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:00,402
Give him one.

256
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:03,003
I'll help you.

257
00:28:12,057 --> 00:28:15,458
I saw you selling postcards
at the gate yesterday.

258
00:28:16,061 --> 00:28:18,120
I sell roses now.

259
00:28:18,163 --> 00:28:20,222
You work here at the zoo?

260
00:28:21,633 --> 00:28:22,622
Yeah.

261
00:28:23,835 --> 00:28:25,700
I take care of the animals.

262
00:28:26,571 --> 00:28:27,731
You like elephants?

263
00:28:27,772 --> 00:28:29,501
Elephants are cute.

264
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:37,842
You know, the cutest animals
can be the most dangerous.

265
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:39,076
A lot of visitors

266
00:28:39,117 --> 00:28:42,052
are accidentally killed
by elephants.

267
00:28:42,087 --> 00:28:45,284
If you get too close,
they will crush you flat.

268
00:28:47,425 --> 00:28:50,724
Here, take one.
I have to go back to work.

269
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:00,568
Still here?

270
00:29:02,807 --> 00:29:04,672
See those birds over there?

271
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,378
Their beaks are like razors.

272
00:29:08,446 --> 00:29:09,640
And those tigers over there.

273
00:29:10,548 --> 00:29:14,746
They look peaceful,
but they'll rip your head off.

274
00:29:14,786 --> 00:29:17,016
What about pigs?

275
00:29:17,055 --> 00:29:19,080
Farm pigs are harmless.

276
00:29:20,058 --> 00:29:22,049
But wild pigs are vicious.

277
00:29:24,129 --> 00:29:25,653
Don't you have
to go to school?

278
00:29:25,697 --> 00:29:27,187
No.

279
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,925
You're wearing
a school uniform.

280
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:34,200
I have to for my work.

281
00:29:37,976 --> 00:29:39,773
Don't you have more flowers
to sell?

282
00:29:40,812 --> 00:29:42,541
I have a lot of work to do.

283
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:44,047
All right.

284
00:30:01,733 --> 00:30:03,064
Down, boy!

285
00:30:07,739 --> 00:30:09,764
Have a seat.

286
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:12,902
Don't be scared.
He won't bite.

287
00:30:22,287 --> 00:30:24,585
You're not married?

288
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:29,686
You ask a lot of questions.

289
00:30:29,727 --> 00:30:31,888
I'm sorry.

290
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:34,990
I was planning
on getting married last month.

291
00:30:35,033 --> 00:30:37,194
To the woman in the photo?

292
00:30:38,703 --> 00:30:41,001
Yeah.
Her name's Phuong.

293
00:30:42,574 --> 00:30:44,872
I don't like Phuongs.

294
00:30:44,909 --> 00:30:48,037
Phuongs are all liars.

295
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:51,480
I have a friend name Phuong.

296
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:54,952
She always steals money
from her mom's purse.

297
00:30:56,254 --> 00:30:57,812
My Phuong...

298
00:30:57,856 --> 00:31:00,791
is no liar.

299
00:31:00,825 --> 00:31:03,089
She just changed her mind.

300
00:31:03,127 --> 00:31:05,493
She'll change it back.

301
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,521
Women change their minds
all the time.

302
00:31:18,776 --> 00:31:21,939
Eat up.

303
00:31:25,283 --> 00:31:27,012
Not hungry?

304
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:29,952
- Your monkey's crazy.
- Oh, yeah?

305
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:59,512
My two cousins at the hotel
talk about you all the time.

306
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:01,814
Lan, the flight attendant...

307
00:32:01,853 --> 00:32:04,287
always coming,
always going.

308
00:32:06,991 --> 00:32:08,925
Your cousins are sweet.

309
00:32:11,663 --> 00:32:14,894
They say you work
for the city?

310
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:18,369
At the office,
I process papers.

311
00:32:18,403 --> 00:32:20,166
It's okay, I guess.

312
00:32:20,204 --> 00:32:24,140
I send money to my mother
every month.

313
00:32:24,175 --> 00:32:26,735
The oldest son has to take care
of the family.

314
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,907
Do you have family in Saigon?

315
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:33,918
My parents live in Nha Trang.

316
00:32:37,588 --> 00:32:40,056
Your perfume
smells so good to me.

317
00:32:45,663 --> 00:32:47,858
What I mean is...

318
00:32:47,899 --> 00:32:49,423
you're so pretty.

319
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:52,300
Prettier than my cousins
told me.

320
00:32:53,571 --> 00:32:56,597
I'm having a good time
sitting with you.

321
00:32:59,744 --> 00:33:02,076
I hear you do magic?

322
00:33:02,113 --> 00:33:03,546
Magic...

323
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:07,716
I do it for fun
at birthday parties.

324
00:33:07,752 --> 00:33:09,947
At friends' weddings too.

325
00:33:11,122 --> 00:33:13,556
Just one moment.

326
00:33:17,595 --> 00:33:19,358
Please pick a card.

327
00:33:22,266 --> 00:33:24,257
Don't let me see it.

328
00:33:26,304 --> 00:33:27,635
Put it back in the deck.

329
00:33:30,808 --> 00:33:32,867
Is it this one?

330
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:40,784
Sorry, I have to go
to the ladies' room.

331
00:34:17,755 --> 00:34:19,723
<i>The number you dialed
is not in service...</i>

332
00:34:35,339 --> 00:34:38,035
You didn't say good-bye.

333
00:34:39,877 --> 00:34:43,540
I'm sorry.
I'm not good at this.

334
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:47,609
You're not attracted to me.
I understand.

335
00:34:47,652 --> 00:34:49,085
No...

336
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,610
you're a nice guy.

337
00:34:50,655 --> 00:34:52,179
You have a nice job.

338
00:34:52,223 --> 00:34:55,090
There's somebody else, right?

339
00:34:56,727 --> 00:34:59,218
That's okay.
You don't have to tell me.

340
00:35:03,868 --> 00:35:05,733
There will be some girl...

341
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:07,328
you'll make very happy.

342
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:09,804
Good night.

343
00:35:27,758 --> 00:35:30,352
How was your date tonight?

344
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:33,221
How do you know
I was on a date?

345
00:35:33,264 --> 00:35:35,391
I can smell your perfume.

346
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:42,538
Well, I'm sitting here
alone at midnight.

347
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:47,369
I know a man
who's really nice.

348
00:35:47,411 --> 00:35:49,436
I know for a fact
he's not married.

349
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,504
But...

350
00:35:50,548 --> 00:35:53,278
he's just a little strange.

351
00:35:54,552 --> 00:35:57,544
I'm not what men want.

352
00:35:57,588 --> 00:36:00,751
You're pretty.
You have a job.

353
00:36:00,791 --> 00:36:02,349
What man doesn't want that?

354
00:36:02,393 --> 00:36:05,055
I'm difficult to understand.

355
00:36:05,096 --> 00:36:07,587
Anyway, I'm leaving soon.

356
00:36:07,632 --> 00:36:08,860
You're leaving?

357
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,834
For work.

358
00:36:10,868 --> 00:36:12,961
I fly to Hanoi on Friday.

359
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:14,335
What time?

360
00:36:14,372 --> 00:36:15,669
3:00.

361
00:36:17,775 --> 00:36:21,267
72 minus 5 times 60...

362
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,477
What are you doing?

363
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:26,039
That's 4,020 minutes
till you leave.

364
00:36:26,083 --> 00:36:29,951
I bet you find someone
before then.

365
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:32,845
You want to bet me?

366
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:35,985
Do you have a place
to sleep tonight?

367
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:38,655
Sure. Next to the river.

368
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:41,164
You sleep by the river?

369
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:43,099
Sometimes.

370
00:36:43,134 --> 00:36:45,227
You don't have friends
in the city?

371
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:49,070
Any family?

372
00:37:11,696 --> 00:37:13,994
How much do you pay
for this room?

373
00:37:14,031 --> 00:37:16,397
The company pays.

374
00:37:19,136 --> 00:37:20,967
They pay
for you to stay here?

375
00:37:22,473 --> 00:37:26,409
There's toothpaste
on the sink.

376
00:37:34,885 --> 00:37:36,580
Go rinse your mouth.

377
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:48,095
I'll sleep on the floor.

378
00:37:48,132 --> 00:37:51,226
You'll sleep on the bed
like normal people.

379
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:53,499
I'm used to the floor.

380
00:37:53,537 --> 00:37:55,596
It's good for the back.

381
00:37:57,041 --> 00:37:59,976
Thuy. I want to help you.

382
00:38:01,178 --> 00:38:04,147
You deserve better things.

383
00:38:05,316 --> 00:38:08,114
Everyone deserves
a real bed.

384
00:38:11,088 --> 00:38:15,184
You can sleep here
anytime you want.

385
00:38:17,662 --> 00:38:19,254
It's time for bed.

386
00:38:27,104 --> 00:38:29,095
Thank you, Miss Lan.

387
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,630
For what?

388
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:35,571
You're kind to me.

389
00:38:35,613 --> 00:38:39,071
A lot of people in the city
aren't so kind.

390
00:38:39,917 --> 00:38:42,147
You have a good heart.

391
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:45,152
That's the most important thing.

392
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:47,657
Now close your eyes.

393
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,791
Dream something nice.

394
00:39:11,082 --> 00:39:13,448
I don't know what I'll do
when you're gone.

395
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:17,445
First it was Phuong.

396
00:39:18,656 --> 00:39:20,419
Now it's your turn.

397
00:39:22,326 --> 00:39:24,317
Everyone leaves.

398
00:39:25,596 --> 00:39:28,656
Do you understand
what I'm telling you?

399
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:31,167
They want to take you
away from me.

400
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:04,824
Thuy!

401
00:40:05,536 --> 00:40:06,901
What are you doing?

402
00:40:06,937 --> 00:40:08,632
I'm sorry.

403
00:40:08,672 --> 00:40:11,140
You have to respect
my things!

404
00:40:11,175 --> 00:40:12,767
I just wanted to see...

405
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:14,778
See what?

406
00:40:14,812 --> 00:40:16,473
How it feels
to be a grown-up.

407
00:40:18,449 --> 00:40:20,007
You don't want to be
like me.

408
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:22,143
But you're pretty.

409
00:40:25,389 --> 00:40:27,323
You're just a little girl.

410
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:29,485
You should stay that way
as long as you can.

411
00:40:41,672 --> 00:40:43,003
Is it good?

412
00:40:47,244 --> 00:40:48,939
I have a gift.

413
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:59,055
I've never been on a plane.

414
00:40:59,089 --> 00:41:01,990
Most people haven't.

415
00:41:03,994 --> 00:41:05,962
What's your job like?

416
00:41:05,996 --> 00:41:09,796
I make sure everyone
has their seat belts on.

417
00:41:09,834 --> 00:41:11,324
I serve them drinks.

418
00:41:11,368 --> 00:41:14,804
I try not to spill drinks
on them.

419
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:19,636
Do you make a lot of money?

420
00:41:21,378 --> 00:41:23,005
You ask a lot of questions.

421
00:41:23,047 --> 00:41:25,515
That's what Mr. Hai says.

422
00:41:25,549 --> 00:41:27,278
Who's Mr. Hai?

423
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:29,843
He works at the zoo.

424
00:41:29,887 --> 00:41:31,878
Do you like animals?

425
00:41:31,922 --> 00:41:32,946
Of course.

426
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:34,287
What's your favorite?

427
00:41:35,526 --> 00:41:38,290
I like giraffes...

428
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:40,957
No, wait. Sparrows.

429
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:44,331
Mr. Hai is like an owl.

430
00:41:44,368 --> 00:41:46,495
He's very wise.

431
00:41:46,537 --> 00:41:48,505
How do you know he's wise?

432
00:41:48,539 --> 00:41:52,305
He talks to the animals.

433
00:41:54,712 --> 00:41:57,476
An owl and a sparrow.

434
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:34,540
Good afternoon.

435
00:42:35,352 --> 00:42:36,910
Can I help you?

436
00:42:36,954 --> 00:42:38,478
Please...

437
00:42:38,522 --> 00:42:40,683
my niece is lost
in the city somewhere.

438
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:43,318
I thought
she might end up here.

439
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:44,827
Here she is.

440
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:48,160
No. Not this girl.

441
00:42:48,198 --> 00:42:49,631
Are you sure?

442
00:42:49,667 --> 00:42:51,225
Can you take a good look?

443
00:42:51,268 --> 00:42:53,896
I'm sure.
But you must know...

444
00:42:53,938 --> 00:42:56,771
there are five other
orphanages in the city.

445
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:02,405
If she shows up here...

446
00:43:02,446 --> 00:43:05,643
please call this number.

447
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:08,051
Bamboo blinds?

448
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:11,054
That's right.
The finest quality.

449
00:43:11,755 --> 00:43:12,949
Thank you, ma'am.

450
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:45,620
I was wondering
if I'd see you around.

451
00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:48,455
I've been working.

452
00:43:48,492 --> 00:43:51,325
How's the flower business?

453
00:43:51,362 --> 00:43:54,058
Better than postcards.

454
00:43:54,898 --> 00:43:58,766
He'd have more space to play
in the jungle.

455
00:43:59,770 --> 00:44:02,603
I've raised this elephant
since he was a baby.

456
00:44:04,274 --> 00:44:08,574
I know everything he does.

457
00:44:11,181 --> 00:44:12,808
This is his home.

458
00:44:14,551 --> 00:44:19,545
But now the city wants
to sell him to a zoo in India.

459
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:23,822
That's not fair.
They can do that to him.

460
00:44:24,628 --> 00:44:26,823
They can do what they want.

461
00:44:26,864 --> 00:44:28,923
The city owns the zoo.

462
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:33,932
They could sell
all the animals here.

463
00:44:33,971 --> 00:44:37,463
They could build
a golf course.

464
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:41,069
We're just little people,
you and me.

465
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:47,880
What if you paid them?
Could you keep the elephant?

466
00:44:49,953 --> 00:44:53,753
Do you know how much
an elephant costs?

467
00:44:56,326 --> 00:44:59,090
You have a lot of spirit.

468
00:45:13,944 --> 00:45:16,674
Do you like tigers?

469
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:18,739
Sure, I like tigers.

470
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:24,650
See?
Tigers are my friends.

471
00:45:24,688 --> 00:45:28,954
But what I really want
is a girlfriend.

472
00:45:28,992 --> 00:45:32,655
I'm so lonely inside.

473
00:45:32,696 --> 00:45:36,223
Wait!
You're moving too fast.

474
00:45:36,266 --> 00:45:39,064
You don't have
to be afraid of me.

475
00:45:40,137 --> 00:45:43,265
- What are you doing in there?
- Nothing.

476
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:02,286
I have to buy food
for the elephants.

477
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:08,823
I could use your help.

478
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:11,927
I can pay you a little.

479
00:46:14,238 --> 00:46:15,227
Hop on.

480
00:46:16,874 --> 00:46:18,899
Put this on.

481
00:46:21,979 --> 00:46:26,348
Air pollution kills
more than 20,000 people a year.

482
00:46:38,695 --> 00:46:41,687
- Here we are.
- Hello, there.

483
00:46:45,869 --> 00:46:49,669
Only little bananas
for the elephants.

484
00:46:49,706 --> 00:46:52,698
Do they have to be ripe?

485
00:46:54,311 --> 00:46:59,476
Not too ripe
so they don't go bad.

486
00:47:18,402 --> 00:47:20,097
Why are we stopping here?

487
00:47:22,472 --> 00:47:24,963
I'm sure
she has a new boyfriend.

488
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:26,870
I can feel it.

489
00:47:26,910 --> 00:47:28,810
Who are you talking about?

490
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,477
Hold on a second.

491
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:40,179
Let me buy your roses.

492
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:49,029
I need you to give her
these roses for me.

493
00:47:49,066 --> 00:47:50,431
No!

494
00:47:50,467 --> 00:47:51,957
I won't do it.

495
00:47:52,002 --> 00:47:53,594
Help me out here.

496
00:47:53,637 --> 00:47:55,036
I can't do it.

497
00:47:57,441 --> 00:47:58,999
Why won't you help me?

498
00:47:59,042 --> 00:48:00,805
She's no good.

499
00:48:01,812 --> 00:48:05,543
She broke your heart once.
She'll do it again.

500
00:48:05,582 --> 00:48:07,641
I know how women are.

501
00:48:09,486 --> 00:48:11,784
Just help me this once.

502
00:48:11,822 --> 00:48:14,347
Find out if she has
a new boyfriend.

503
00:48:14,391 --> 00:48:15,790
How do I do that?

504
00:48:16,793 --> 00:48:20,092
See how she looks
when you give her these.

505
00:48:20,130 --> 00:48:23,497
Does she smile?
Does she look sad?

506
00:48:23,533 --> 00:48:25,694
You said you know
how women are?

507
00:48:27,037 --> 00:48:30,029
Remember.
Don't tell her it's from me.

508
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:41,442
This is the newest model.
Lots of features.

509
00:48:41,485 --> 00:48:43,783
It does video and pictures.

510
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:47,586
- You have others?
- Of course.

511
00:48:47,624 --> 00:48:50,218
This one's even newer.

512
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:54,526
Sharp pictures and video...

513
00:48:54,564 --> 00:48:55,724
How much?

514
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:58,098
Only 5.9 million dong.

515
00:48:58,135 --> 00:49:00,763
- Too much.
- I can lower it.

516
00:49:00,804 --> 00:49:03,364
Hold on. Wait.

517
00:49:06,576 --> 00:49:09,773
I'm not buying flowers.
Go sell them somewhere else.

518
00:49:09,813 --> 00:49:12,805
I'm not selling.

519
00:49:12,849 --> 00:49:15,477
You're here to buy a phone?

520
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:20,252
I'm not buying a phone.
I'm delivering these.

521
00:49:24,661 --> 00:49:25,889
No card?

522
00:49:31,335 --> 00:49:32,495
A secret admirer?

523
00:49:32,536 --> 00:49:34,697
I can't tell you.

524
00:49:34,738 --> 00:49:37,332
Maybe it's from your boyfriend.

525
00:49:40,544 --> 00:49:41,909
I don't have a boyfriend.

526
00:49:44,514 --> 00:49:47,847
I have to get back
to work now.

527
00:50:06,403 --> 00:50:07,597
So?

528
00:50:08,772 --> 00:50:10,069
It's done.

529
00:50:12,009 --> 00:50:14,273
What did she say?

530
00:50:14,311 --> 00:50:16,973
She said nothing.

531
00:50:17,014 --> 00:50:18,811
What do you mean, nothing?

532
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:20,407
Does she have
a new boyfriend?

533
00:50:25,389 --> 00:50:28,017
Tell me!

534
00:50:28,058 --> 00:50:29,320
Yes.

535
00:50:30,827 --> 00:50:32,260
Yes what?

536
00:50:32,295 --> 00:50:33,956
She has a new boyfriend.

537
00:50:37,334 --> 00:50:38,596
She told you that?

538
00:50:38,635 --> 00:50:42,071
I tried to tell you.
You wouldn't listen.

539
00:50:42,105 --> 00:50:43,902
She's no good.

540
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:47,536
She's no good for you!

541
00:51:08,231 --> 00:51:10,495
You don't smile anymore.

542
00:51:17,407 --> 00:51:19,102
You're cold now.

543
00:51:21,078 --> 00:51:22,875
I'm older now.

544
00:51:25,449 --> 00:51:28,577
When I first met you...

545
00:51:28,618 --> 00:51:31,178
you were so nervous.

546
00:51:32,522 --> 00:51:35,355
It was your first day
training with the airline.

547
00:51:35,392 --> 00:51:37,656
3,000 meters up high...

548
00:51:37,694 --> 00:51:40,128
walking down the aisles...

549
00:51:40,163 --> 00:51:42,563
always with a smile
on your face.

550
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:45,591
You were just a young girl.

551
00:51:45,635 --> 00:51:48,263
Naïve... but stubborn.

552
00:51:50,107 --> 00:51:52,371
And you were the captain.

553
00:52:01,084 --> 00:52:02,881
What's wrong?

554
00:52:02,919 --> 00:52:05,581
You should give it
to her instead.

555
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:07,089
Who?

556
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:09,990
Your wife!

557
00:52:11,528 --> 00:52:13,428
You want me to leave her?

558
00:52:13,463 --> 00:52:15,590
Would that make you happy?

559
00:52:18,201 --> 00:52:20,328
I'm leaving.

560
00:52:20,370 --> 00:52:22,133
She's probably waiting
for you.

561
00:52:35,452 --> 00:52:38,012
You ever think of meeting
a new woman?

562
00:52:41,458 --> 00:52:43,983
Let's eat out tonight.

563
00:52:45,228 --> 00:52:46,889
Goat hot pot!

564
00:52:46,930 --> 00:52:49,228
I know a really good place.

565
00:52:49,266 --> 00:52:51,257
The big place
on Ha Ba Trung Street.

566
00:52:52,502 --> 00:52:54,094
So...

567
00:52:54,137 --> 00:52:55,729
what are you going to do now?

568
00:52:57,007 --> 00:52:59,134
I'm going out tonight.

569
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:02,407
I'm treating myself
to a nice dinner.

570
00:53:15,525 --> 00:53:18,824
How long can you keep
selling roses?

571
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:20,523
I don't know.

572
00:53:23,433 --> 00:53:26,402
How long till you stop?

573
00:53:26,436 --> 00:53:27,926
One week...

574
00:53:27,971 --> 00:53:29,404
one month...

575
00:53:29,439 --> 00:53:31,600
one year?

576
00:53:31,641 --> 00:53:33,472
I don't know.

577
00:53:35,645 --> 00:53:37,670
Listen to me.

578
00:53:37,714 --> 00:53:39,705
I have a friend.

579
00:53:39,749 --> 00:53:42,115
She works at a home.

580
00:53:42,152 --> 00:53:44,712
For young girls like you.

581
00:53:44,754 --> 00:53:47,086
Young girls who need help.

582
00:53:47,123 --> 00:53:49,990
They have books.

583
00:53:50,026 --> 00:53:52,620
They have clothes.

584
00:53:52,662 --> 00:53:55,597
An orphanage! You want
to send me to an orphanage.

585
00:53:55,632 --> 00:53:57,429
You won't have to sleep
in the streets.

586
00:53:57,467 --> 00:54:00,334
You want to lock me up
like one of your animals.

587
00:54:03,707 --> 00:54:04,799
Thuy!

588
00:55:29,492 --> 00:55:32,086
You said I could
sleep here anytime.

589
00:55:32,128 --> 00:55:33,686
I didn't mean
in front of the door!

590
00:55:33,730 --> 00:55:35,960
Are you mad at me?

591
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:38,160
I'm tired.

592
00:55:38,201 --> 00:55:39,759
Is it a boy problem?

593
00:55:42,405 --> 00:55:44,635
You have to learn
not to ask so many questions.

594
00:55:46,443 --> 00:55:47,637
I'm sorry.

595
00:55:47,677 --> 00:55:49,440
Who are you running from?

596
00:55:49,479 --> 00:55:51,743
I'm not running from anyone.

597
00:55:52,682 --> 00:55:54,047
Don't lie to me.

598
00:55:54,084 --> 00:55:56,518
I'm not lying.

599
00:55:57,987 --> 00:56:00,751
Are you in trouble?

600
00:56:04,994 --> 00:56:07,485
I'm sorry I bothered you.

601
00:56:08,198 --> 00:56:09,426
Thuy!

602
00:56:14,404 --> 00:56:16,133
Don't go.

603
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:23,043
I won't trouble you anymore.

604
00:56:23,079 --> 00:56:25,104
You don't trouble me.

605
00:56:25,148 --> 00:56:27,139
I'm just having a bad day.

606
00:56:29,386 --> 00:56:33,379
We should go out to eat.
You'll feel better.

607
00:56:33,423 --> 00:56:36,756
I don't think that'll help.

608
00:56:39,763 --> 00:56:42,527
Goat hot pot!
I know a a good place. My treat.

609
00:56:44,601 --> 00:56:47,365
You have money
for goat hot pot?

610
00:56:50,507 --> 00:56:52,907
Business is good.

611
00:57:19,836 --> 00:57:21,133
He's here.

612
00:57:21,171 --> 00:57:22,934
- Who?
- Mr. Hai!

613
00:57:35,218 --> 00:57:38,415
Miss Lan!
This is Mr. Hai.

614
00:57:38,455 --> 00:57:39,581
He works at the...

615
00:57:39,622 --> 00:57:41,715
I work in management.

616
00:57:41,758 --> 00:57:43,749
Management?

617
00:57:46,196 --> 00:57:47,356
Let's eat.

618
00:57:49,265 --> 00:57:51,130
Let me serve you.

619
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:55,998
Have you been flying long?

620
00:58:56,032 --> 00:58:58,830
Four years now.

621
00:58:58,868 --> 00:59:01,359
It's a regular job.

622
00:59:05,542 --> 00:59:07,100
Are you afraid?

623
00:59:08,144 --> 00:59:11,773
Working high up.
Things could happen.

624
00:59:11,814 --> 00:59:13,975
Things could happen
anytime, anywhere.

625
00:59:35,171 --> 00:59:36,570
Excuse me.

626
00:59:36,606 --> 00:59:38,130
Are you okay?

627
00:59:38,174 --> 00:59:40,165
No...

628
00:59:40,209 --> 00:59:42,404
I just need to wash my face.

629
00:59:57,827 --> 00:59:59,624
Come up and sing.

630
00:59:59,662 --> 01:00:01,152
Oh, no. I can't.

631
01:00:01,197 --> 01:00:03,791
One song! One song!

632
01:00:08,538 --> 01:00:10,438
Relax.

633
01:00:10,473 --> 01:00:12,441
Relax!

634
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:25,417
Relax.

635
01:00:25,455 --> 01:00:27,218
Relax. Calm down.

636
01:00:31,761 --> 01:00:33,626
She's just a girl.

637
01:01:48,171 --> 01:01:50,765
Does she ever talk
about her parents?

638
01:01:52,508 --> 01:01:54,942
They're in heaven now.

639
01:01:54,977 --> 01:01:56,911
That's all I know.

640
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:13,655
There's over 8 million people
living in this city.

641
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:21,631
You ever feel so small
in this world?

642
01:02:23,873 --> 01:02:26,000
When I'm in the sky
looking down.

643
01:02:27,076 --> 01:02:29,738
I can look down
and see fields of rice.

644
01:02:31,047 --> 01:02:33,208
I can see people.

645
01:02:33,249 --> 01:02:35,877
They don't know
I'm watching them.

646
01:02:40,456 --> 01:02:43,220
They're so small...
like ants.

647
01:02:45,862 --> 01:02:50,526
When I look closer,
I can see faces.

648
01:02:51,801 --> 01:02:54,793
Old women working
in the fields.

649
01:02:54,837 --> 01:02:57,601
Children playing
with buffalos.

650
01:03:00,309 --> 01:03:02,004
Sisters holding hands.

651
01:03:03,079 --> 01:03:06,674
Like God... looking down
on his children.

652
01:03:08,918 --> 01:03:10,749
I'm no God.

653
01:03:10,787 --> 01:03:14,314
I'm just a girl.

654
01:03:14,357 --> 01:03:17,884
26 years old.

655
01:03:20,329 --> 01:03:23,821
Still looking
for a fairy tale.

656
01:03:25,868 --> 01:03:28,029
People look at me and ask...

657
01:03:28,070 --> 01:03:32,530
why I'm alone.

658
01:03:33,709 --> 01:03:36,439
I tell them...

659
01:03:36,479 --> 01:03:38,970
I don't know what I want.

660
01:03:43,786 --> 01:03:46,721
I'm... I'm sorry.

661
01:03:48,791 --> 01:03:51,453
I don't work in management.

662
01:03:52,795 --> 01:03:54,194
I know.

663
01:03:56,599 --> 01:03:58,464
I know you work at the zoo.

664
01:04:03,306 --> 01:04:06,935
I'm sorry...

665
01:04:06,976 --> 01:04:08,944
I didn't tell you the truth.

666
01:04:11,247 --> 01:04:13,681
Just don't lie to me again.

667
01:05:40,136 --> 01:05:43,663
Have you seen
this girl around?

668
01:05:45,574 --> 01:05:46,734
No, sir.

669
01:06:06,929 --> 01:06:08,794
- Don't go on the streets.
- How come?

670
01:06:08,831 --> 01:06:11,299
- They're checking for papers.
- What?

671
01:06:41,497 --> 01:06:42,896
Don't follow me!

672
01:07:31,113 --> 01:07:32,546
Thuy?

673
01:07:36,385 --> 01:07:38,615
Have you seen
the little girl?

674
01:07:38,654 --> 01:07:40,884
- Who?
- The little flower girl.

675
01:07:41,991 --> 01:07:43,219
Have you seen her?

676
01:07:45,094 --> 01:07:47,062
Thanks anyway.

677
01:08:02,478 --> 01:08:04,105
You like dolls?

678
01:08:06,048 --> 01:08:08,243
You're too big
to play with dolls.

679
01:08:08,284 --> 01:08:11,117
I've seen her on the street
selling roses.

680
01:08:11,153 --> 01:08:12,484
She's got money, then.

681
01:08:12,521 --> 01:08:14,011
I have no money.

682
01:08:14,056 --> 01:08:15,455
Are you sure?

683
01:08:15,491 --> 01:08:16,480
I told you no.

684
01:08:16,525 --> 01:08:18,152
Let's see.

685
01:08:26,001 --> 01:08:27,593
Promise me...

686
01:08:27,636 --> 01:08:29,228
you won't let anyone
hurt me.

687
01:08:29,271 --> 01:08:31,899
- Promise me.
- I promise.

688
01:08:56,332 --> 01:08:59,358
Hi. I would have called.
I didn't have your number.

689
01:08:59,401 --> 01:09:01,699
I don't have a phone.

690
01:09:04,106 --> 01:09:05,403
Please come in.

691
01:09:05,441 --> 01:09:08,137
Sorry, my place is a mess.

692
01:09:08,177 --> 01:09:10,077
That's okay.

693
01:09:16,218 --> 01:09:17,617
You've lived here long.

694
01:09:19,288 --> 01:09:23,987
My father was the zookeeper
for many years before he died.

695
01:09:25,928 --> 01:09:28,158
I grew up
with these animals.

696
01:09:29,431 --> 01:09:31,456
You like them
more than people.

697
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:33,934
That's what they say.

698
01:09:33,969 --> 01:09:35,732
Please have some tea.

699
01:09:36,739 --> 01:09:38,900
I wanted to tell you...

700
01:09:38,941 --> 01:09:42,604
I think
you're a good person.

701
01:09:43,879 --> 01:09:47,246
I see the way
Thuy follows you.

702
01:09:47,283 --> 01:09:49,274
She looks up to you.

703
01:09:49,318 --> 01:09:53,277
She even tells me
she talks to the animals.

704
01:09:59,195 --> 01:10:01,390
What are you looking at?

705
01:10:06,936 --> 01:10:09,427
You have an honest face.

706
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:12,974
Anyone ever told you that?

707
01:10:14,343 --> 01:10:15,332
Never.

708
01:10:43,239 --> 01:10:44,831
Thank you.

709
01:11:04,693 --> 01:11:06,524
Have you seen Thuy?

710
01:11:06,562 --> 01:11:08,257
They took her away.

711
01:11:08,297 --> 01:11:09,924
What?

712
01:11:09,965 --> 01:11:12,559
The city man took her away.

713
01:11:12,601 --> 01:11:14,193
What man?

714
01:11:14,236 --> 01:11:17,399
She got caught.
They took her to an orphanage.

715
01:11:18,307 --> 01:11:19,331
Thanks a lot.

716
01:12:05,054 --> 01:12:06,180
Give it back!

717
01:12:07,189 --> 01:12:08,281
Give it back!

718
01:12:41,223 --> 01:12:43,384
You are here to claim Thuy?

719
01:12:43,425 --> 01:12:45,325
- Yes.
- Yes.

720
01:12:45,361 --> 01:12:48,057
Are you the mother and father?

721
01:12:49,331 --> 01:12:50,423
- Yes.
- No.

722
01:12:50,466 --> 01:12:51,763
- Yes.
- No.

723
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:53,358
Yes or no?

724
01:12:54,002 --> 01:12:56,630
Not officially.

725
01:12:56,672 --> 01:13:00,039
Then you have no claim.

726
01:13:01,043 --> 01:13:04,774
She doesn't have family.
We're the only ones she knows.

727
01:13:04,813 --> 01:13:07,077
How do you know
she doesn't have family?

728
01:13:07,116 --> 01:13:10,381
She told me.

729
01:13:10,419 --> 01:13:13,547
You believe everything
a little girl tells you?

730
01:13:14,623 --> 01:13:16,386
She wouldn't lie about that.

731
01:13:21,830 --> 01:13:25,857
Even if I wanted,
I couldn't release her to you.

732
01:13:25,901 --> 01:13:28,893
You're not family.

733
01:13:28,937 --> 01:13:32,338
We have to follow rules.

734
01:13:37,079 --> 01:13:39,013
Good day.

735
01:13:39,047 --> 01:13:41,811
Someone called.
Told me my niece is here.

736
01:13:41,850 --> 01:13:44,045
Her name is Thuy.

737
01:13:44,086 --> 01:13:45,485
I'm her uncle.

738
01:13:47,055 --> 01:13:49,523
This couple have come
to claim her.

739
01:13:50,459 --> 01:13:52,723
I don't know these people.

740
01:13:52,761 --> 01:13:54,456
I don't know who they are.

741
01:13:56,532 --> 01:13:59,695
Do you have proof
that you're her uncle?

742
01:13:59,735 --> 01:14:02,863
I'm a factory manager
in Bien Hoa.

743
01:14:02,905 --> 01:14:05,897
- I'm very respected in town.
- I need proof.

744
01:14:07,309 --> 01:14:08,640
Of course.

745
01:14:11,146 --> 01:14:12,670
My name is Tran Le Minh.

746
01:14:12,714 --> 01:14:16,582
Her father was my brother,
Tran Loc Minh.

747
01:14:16,618 --> 01:14:19,086
Here's his death certificate.

748
01:14:39,675 --> 01:14:40,664
Thuy.

749
01:14:41,810 --> 01:14:43,334
Your uncle is here
to take you home.

750
01:14:44,780 --> 01:14:46,008
Do you want to go home?

751
01:14:46,048 --> 01:14:48,516
Of course
she wants to go home.

752
01:14:48,550 --> 01:14:50,074
She can speak for herself.

753
01:14:51,620 --> 01:14:53,713
She's afraid.

754
01:14:53,755 --> 01:14:55,222
Excuse me.

755
01:14:55,257 --> 01:14:56,918
Are you family?

756
01:14:57,860 --> 01:14:59,555
I don't think so.

757
01:14:59,595 --> 01:15:01,153
It's not your business.

758
01:15:04,166 --> 01:15:06,430
She wouldn't have run
if she wasn't scared.

759
01:15:06,468 --> 01:15:08,129
Who are you, woman?

760
01:15:08,170 --> 01:15:11,537
Thuy, your uncle
wants to take you home.

761
01:15:12,574 --> 01:15:15,236
Do you understand
what I'm telling you?

762
01:15:17,346 --> 01:15:19,109
Look at her.
She's afraid.

763
01:15:20,315 --> 01:15:22,442
- Thuy!
- Sorry.

764
01:15:22,484 --> 01:15:25,044
We have to follow rules.

765
01:15:48,510 --> 01:15:49,807
I'm not going!

766
01:15:54,316 --> 01:15:56,250
I'm so sorry.

767
01:16:02,391 --> 01:16:05,121
Let me go.
I'm not going!

768
01:16:05,160 --> 01:16:07,958
I'm not going!
I'm not going!

769
01:17:49,431 --> 01:17:51,160
Thuy!

770
01:17:51,199 --> 01:17:53,292
Where's the change?

771
01:17:53,335 --> 01:17:54,893
Sorry, I forgot.

772
01:17:56,705 --> 01:17:58,798
Hey!

773
01:17:58,840 --> 01:18:00,774
Sit down.

774
01:18:00,809 --> 01:18:03,107
I'm not done talking.

775
01:18:06,581 --> 01:18:10,210
I understand
why you left me.

776
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:14,020
But you embarrassed me.

777
01:18:15,390 --> 01:18:18,086
People in the neighborhood
are talking.

778
01:18:19,361 --> 01:18:20,828
Hey!

779
01:18:20,862 --> 01:18:22,853
Are you listening?

780
01:18:22,898 --> 01:18:24,297
I want some respect.

781
01:18:24,332 --> 01:18:26,766
Look at me
when I'm talking.

782
01:18:26,802 --> 01:18:28,292
Look at me!

783
01:18:28,336 --> 01:18:30,236
- You know about respect?
- Yes.

784
01:18:35,410 --> 01:18:37,002
Stupid girl!

785
01:20:44,439 --> 01:20:46,999
They're coming next week
to take you away.

786
01:20:53,181 --> 01:20:56,412
Tell me what to do,
and I'll do it.

787
01:21:02,023 --> 01:21:03,786
I can't do that.

788
01:21:04,893 --> 01:21:07,191
I can't set you free.

789
01:21:08,063 --> 01:21:09,963
Maybe...

790
01:21:09,998 --> 01:21:12,159
they'll give you
a better home.

791
01:21:36,825 --> 01:21:38,520
Thuy! Thuy!

792
01:21:40,262 --> 01:21:41,593
How'd you get in?

793
01:21:41,630 --> 01:21:43,598
You didn't lock the door.

794
01:21:47,235 --> 01:21:48,361
What's that?

795
01:21:48,403 --> 01:21:50,462
Money... to keep the elephant.

796
01:21:52,007 --> 01:21:53,474
Where did you get this?

797
01:21:54,743 --> 01:21:57,906
Is it enough
to keep the elephant?

798
01:21:57,946 --> 01:21:59,436
Did you steal it?

799
01:22:00,515 --> 01:22:01,743
I didn't steal it.

800
01:22:01,783 --> 01:22:04,081
I worked at Uncle's factory.

801
01:22:04,119 --> 01:22:05,950
He owes me this money.

802
01:22:08,390 --> 01:22:10,324
It's not yours.

803
01:22:10,358 --> 01:22:11,791
This is wrong!

804
01:22:17,198 --> 01:22:18,688
We have to give it back.

805
01:22:20,235 --> 01:22:22,066
He owes me this money!

806
01:22:22,103 --> 01:22:23,866
It's not yours!

807
01:22:23,905 --> 01:22:25,372
He owes me!

808
01:22:29,244 --> 01:22:30,643
He probably called the cops!

809
01:22:31,746 --> 01:22:33,611
I'm sure they're looking
for you!

810
01:22:34,716 --> 01:22:36,445
Why did you do
such a stupid thing?

811
01:22:40,922 --> 01:22:42,890
I did it for you.

812
01:22:42,924 --> 01:22:45,188
I know you love
that elephant.

813
01:23:07,248 --> 01:23:08,806
It's okay.

814
01:23:10,618 --> 01:23:13,746
You tried
to do something good.

815
01:23:13,788 --> 01:23:17,121
You know it's wrong, right?

816
01:23:18,093 --> 01:23:22,029
You know we have
to give it back.

817
01:23:23,064 --> 01:23:24,691
Wait here.

818
01:23:30,505 --> 01:23:32,063
Write down his address.

819
01:23:33,708 --> 01:23:35,005
Write down his address.

820
01:23:35,043 --> 01:23:36,340
Write it down.

821
01:23:36,378 --> 01:23:37,936
You don't know my uncle.

822
01:23:37,979 --> 01:23:39,378
He has a bad temper.

823
01:23:39,414 --> 01:23:41,279
You're in a lot of trouble.

824
01:23:42,183 --> 01:23:43,912
Write it down
so I can fix it.

825
01:23:43,952 --> 01:23:46,079
Take the pen!

826
01:23:46,121 --> 01:23:47,486
Write it!

827
01:24:19,320 --> 01:24:20,514
Sir.

828
01:24:20,555 --> 01:24:23,285
The money's all here.

829
01:24:23,324 --> 01:24:24,757
It belongs to you.

830
01:24:26,961 --> 01:24:28,019
Where is she?

831
01:24:28,063 --> 01:24:30,031
She's safe.

832
01:24:31,199 --> 01:24:32,598
Actually...

833
01:24:32,634 --> 01:24:34,329
she got the money...

834
01:24:34,369 --> 01:24:35,393
to buy an elephant.

835
01:24:35,437 --> 01:24:37,803
An elephant?

836
01:24:37,839 --> 01:24:39,807
Is this some kind of joke?

837
01:24:41,009 --> 01:24:42,670
She's a good girl.

838
01:24:42,710 --> 01:24:44,473
She's got a good heart.

839
01:24:45,747 --> 01:24:47,214
A grown man like yourself.

840
01:24:48,216 --> 01:24:50,844
What are you doing
with a ten-year-old girl?

841
01:24:55,390 --> 01:24:56,721
Please.

842
01:25:01,930 --> 01:25:03,727
I'd like to propose something.

843
01:25:05,066 --> 01:25:06,260
If you will listen.

844
01:25:07,202 --> 01:25:08,601
Maybe...

845
01:25:08,636 --> 01:25:10,604
I can help you.

846
01:25:10,638 --> 01:25:11,832
Maybe...

847
01:25:11,873 --> 01:25:13,431
we can help each other.

848
01:25:15,009 --> 01:25:16,601
Will you listen?

849
01:25:22,517 --> 01:25:26,044
She can live at the zoo.

850
01:25:27,489 --> 01:25:30,049
I'll train her to work there.

851
01:25:31,659 --> 01:25:33,149
She'll attend school.

852
01:25:33,194 --> 01:25:36,027
No. No way.

853
01:25:36,064 --> 01:25:39,500
She works here with me.
At the factory.

854
01:25:39,534 --> 01:25:42,298
What's she going to do
at school?

855
01:25:42,337 --> 01:25:44,032
She's useless.

856
01:25:47,475 --> 01:25:48,908
She's not useless.

857
01:25:48,943 --> 01:25:51,070
Her head's not there.

858
01:25:51,112 --> 01:25:52,340
Always dreaming.

859
01:25:52,380 --> 01:25:57,511
She talks to dolls
like a crazy person.

860
01:25:59,587 --> 01:26:01,145
The zoo would pay me.

861
01:26:01,189 --> 01:26:04,090
In turn, I will pay you.

862
01:26:04,125 --> 01:26:05,183
You'd pay me?

863
01:26:05,226 --> 01:26:07,820
That's right.
Every month.

864
01:26:07,862 --> 01:26:09,727
Every month?

865
01:26:22,610 --> 01:26:25,636
I tried to do something
to keep you.

866
01:26:25,680 --> 01:26:27,875
But I messed up.

867
01:26:27,916 --> 01:26:30,441
You make Mr. Hai happy.

868
01:26:30,485 --> 01:26:32,851
He should be happy.

869
01:26:34,088 --> 01:26:36,955
I think Ms. Lan
would make him happy.

870
01:26:36,991 --> 01:26:38,185
What do you think?

871
01:26:41,729 --> 01:26:43,196
You think so, too?

872
01:26:47,869 --> 01:26:49,461
He likes you.

873
01:26:51,539 --> 01:26:53,666
The way he looks at you.

874
01:26:53,708 --> 01:26:57,235
He's sad.
He doesn't want to leave.

875
01:26:58,413 --> 01:27:00,643
He'll make new friends.

876
01:27:04,452 --> 01:27:06,443
How would you like
to work here?

877
01:27:08,690 --> 01:27:10,521
I can't pay you much.

878
01:27:11,392 --> 01:27:13,952
You'd have to work till dark.

879
01:27:13,995 --> 01:27:16,463
At night, you'd have
to do homework.

880
01:27:16,497 --> 01:27:18,055
You can't be lazy.

881
01:27:19,200 --> 01:27:20,963
But Uncle Minh.

882
01:27:22,136 --> 01:27:24,001
I took care of it.

883
01:27:24,038 --> 01:27:26,973
What did you do?
Did you hurt him?

884
01:27:28,676 --> 01:27:30,735
I didn't hurt him.

885
01:27:30,778 --> 01:27:32,643
You don't have to worry
about him.

886
01:27:38,553 --> 01:27:40,578
Aren't you happy?

887
01:27:40,622 --> 01:27:42,112
I don't know.

888
01:27:43,324 --> 01:27:44,791
You don't know what?

889
01:27:46,427 --> 01:27:48,292
I don't want to let you down.

890
01:27:55,803 --> 01:27:58,601
I don't know
why you help me.

891
01:27:59,641 --> 01:28:01,404
You're not useless.

892
01:28:01,442 --> 01:28:02,739
I know this.

893
01:28:17,959 --> 01:28:20,655
Three bundles
of bananas, please.

894
01:28:20,695 --> 01:28:23,493
Where's Hai today?
You're here alone?

895
01:28:23,531 --> 01:28:27,661
I'm buying bananas today.
I work for the zoo now.

896
01:28:27,702 --> 01:28:29,067
Really?

897
01:28:33,574 --> 01:28:37,408
- Get back safe.
- Yes. Bye.

898
01:28:52,160 --> 01:28:54,390
Excuse me.
Is Miss Lan here?

899
01:28:54,429 --> 01:28:56,056
She's out, sweetie.

900
01:29:28,429 --> 01:29:30,158
She's leaving today.

901
01:29:33,101 --> 01:29:35,433
You have nothing to say?

902
01:29:36,804 --> 01:29:38,897
What do you want me to say?

903
01:29:38,940 --> 01:29:40,771
You don't miss her?

904
01:29:42,610 --> 01:29:46,444
A woman like her...

905
01:29:46,481 --> 01:29:48,779
they don't end up
with men like me.

906
01:29:48,816 --> 01:29:51,011
How do you know?

907
01:29:53,588 --> 01:29:55,021
Take a look at me.

908
01:29:55,957 --> 01:29:57,584
I wear a bargain watch.

909
01:29:58,426 --> 01:30:00,189
I wear bargain shoes.

910
01:30:01,562 --> 01:30:03,427
I have one good shirt.

911
01:30:05,166 --> 01:30:07,225
I see the way
she looks at you.

912
01:30:09,303 --> 01:30:12,670
Forget it.
It's over now.

913
01:30:13,908 --> 01:30:17,105
We have to think
about us now.

914
01:30:18,980 --> 01:30:21,505
We have to think
about the future.

915
01:30:22,483 --> 01:30:25,213
You're the one that's running.

916
01:30:52,079 --> 01:30:53,706
Here are the keys.

917
01:30:54,882 --> 01:30:56,816
We'll see you next week.

918
01:30:56,851 --> 01:30:58,478
Same time.

919
01:30:58,519 --> 01:30:59,884
Same time.

920
01:31:02,657 --> 01:31:04,682
There's a package for you.

921
01:31:07,094 --> 01:31:08,823
Thanks.

922
01:31:12,767 --> 01:31:15,531
- Good-bye.
- Have a good trip.

923
01:31:15,570 --> 01:31:17,003
I'll see you next week.

924
01:31:17,038 --> 01:31:20,269
Please pick a card.

925
01:31:29,517 --> 01:31:30,848
Is it this one?

926
01:31:32,653 --> 01:31:33,779
Yes.

927
01:31:33,821 --> 01:31:36,187

928
01:32:04,519 --> 01:32:05,850
What's wrong?

929
01:32:07,755 --> 01:32:09,245
Give me a minute.

930
01:32:09,290 --> 01:32:11,087
We only have 20 minutes.

931
01:32:12,260 --> 01:32:13,887
I need a minute.

932
01:32:13,928 --> 01:32:15,555
Don't be late.

933
01:32:52,867 --> 01:32:55,495
<i>Miss Lan...</i>

934
01:32:55,536 --> 01:32:58,369
<i>I know you're leaving today.</i>

935
01:32:59,373 --> 01:33:02,001
<i>If you're in the sky...</i>

936
01:33:02,043 --> 01:33:05,069
<i>when you read this...</i>

937
01:33:05,112 --> 01:33:07,945
<i>I want you to look down
to the city...</i>

938
01:33:07,982 --> 01:33:09,574
<i>and look for me.</i>

939
01:33:09,617 --> 01:33:12,745
<i>I'll be looking up
at the same time.</i>

940
01:33:14,121 --> 01:33:18,023
<i>I want you to know
the last few days...</i>

941
01:33:18,059 --> 01:33:21,551
<i>have been happy times for me.</i>

942
01:33:21,596 --> 01:33:25,259
<i>I won't forget how kind
you've been to me.</i>

943
01:33:25,299 --> 01:33:29,429
<i>Mr. Hai says animals
are like people.</i>

944
01:33:29,470 --> 01:33:32,030
<i>They feel lonely too.</i>

945
01:33:32,073 --> 01:33:35,634
<i>But I want to tell you
something.</i>

946
01:33:35,676 --> 01:33:37,268
<i>I hope...</i>

947
01:33:37,311 --> 01:33:39,108
<i>you're reading this letter.</i>

948
01:33:41,282 --> 01:33:44,547
<i>You...you're family to me.</i>
