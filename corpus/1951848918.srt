And your shares...

We can, you can, perhaps
You must invest more.

No, small amounts.
Keep it simply simple.

No any chance Ventures.

The kontrolno is already within, he has the name
Of the winning horse.

And understand this well bastards,
The chances are eight to one.

What is the name of the winning horse?

43
00:07:51,722 --> 00:07:54,933
Butterfly.

44
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,842
Do you want something?

How much?

49
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:28,485
Ten, ten thousand dollars.

50
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:37,286
Wait, twenty.

51
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:46,461
What would you think of fifty?

52
00:09:47,171 --> 00:09:49,673
Have you so much money for you?

53
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:54,636
Because if you do not, you can always
Borrow something from the house.

Nobody comes here because
They are a bit like gambling.

00:25:12,513 --> 00:25:16,517
You know what I say?
I want to fuck tonight.

167
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:27,611
I heard that my favorite uncle
Here.

168
00:25:29,321 --> 00:25:32,533
How are you?
-- How is it Tony? Good to see you.

169
00:25:33,867 --> 00:25:35,953
That is the nephew of the boss.

170
00:25:36,036 --> 00:25:39,039
That is damned big.

171
00:25:39,581 --> 00:25:43,418
What kind of person is he?
-- Can express themselves well.

172
00:25:43,669 --> 00:25:47,965
Did my men ensured good for you?
-- Yes, we are going to the city.

173
00:25:49,341 --> 00:25:51,718
A young man must refresh its oil.

174
00:25:52,219 --> 00:25:54,137
Listen to me...

175
00:25:56,098 --> 00:25:59,309
Your father wants you your virginity that I
Let lose, you show how it works.

176
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:03,355
There is enough time to use your dick
To wave, but we must make time for...

177
00:26:06,108 --> 00:26:08,026
Affairs.
-- Exactly.

178
00:26:08,151 --> 00:26:10,904
No running joke, okay.

179
00:26:12,656 --> 00:26:16,076
Would you take Tony tonight on your rounds?
The city show, show what we do?

180
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:19,204
Beginning with his training.
Him company.

181
00:26:21,248 --> 00:26:24,459
Sure.
-- Good then.

182
00:26:24,543 --> 00:26:28,046
Stay out of trouble.
Think of the last time.

183
00:26:28,964 --> 00:26:32,342
Adrea No more, I swear it.
-- It is now funny.

184
00:26:33,302 --> 00:26:36,847
Do you get away. Go out,
l have things to discuss.

185
00:26:37,431 --> 00:26:39,474
I can see you later.

186
00:26:47,399 --> 00:26:49,693
He is a damn problem.

187
00:26:50,068 --> 00:26:52,321
Make sure he is not in trouble.
Perhaps he still learns something.

188
00:26:52,487 --> 00:26:56,408
But now it's time for business.

189
00:26:57,534 --> 00:26:59,411
You can listen to.

190
00:27:19,765 --> 00:27:23,185
What do you think?
-- It is good.

191
00:27:23,685 --> 00:27:27,856
Sorry? It is damned amazing.
What are you talking about?

192
00:27:28,106 --> 00:27:30,275
I do not know a lot of music.

193
00:27:30,609 --> 00:27:32,903
A customer of mine, which are debt
Paid to me...

194
00:27:32,903 --> 00:27:35,614
A portion of the deal
Was its management's contract.

195
00:27:35,739 --> 00:27:40,369
This is her first CD. The sale,
lncreases through the roof. Many promising.

196
00:27:40,702 --> 00:27:43,080
I am sorry, I can still
Not follow.

197
00:27:44,623 --> 00:27:47,793
How long do we do this already?

198
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:51,630
Too long. I am tired of order behind
The money to hunt.

199
00:27:51,713 --> 00:27:56,301
I am tired of lessons to nietsnutten
Learning, which do not want to pay.

200
00:27:59,471 --> 00:28:04,059
I have always hoped for more.
For us both.

201
00:28:07,271 --> 00:28:08,981
This girl is our way up.

202
00:28:09,064 --> 00:28:13,527
I am sure that it is evil, if they
Discovered that I am her new manager, but...

203
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:17,781
Count because I do it.
Let you but her.

204
00:28:20,826 --> 00:28:23,620
What is it? What do you see?

205
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:26,957
Nothing.

206
00:28:27,583 --> 00:28:30,919
You see something.
-- I see nothing.

207
00:28:30,961 --> 00:28:33,130
What do you mean?
Did they have no future?

208
00:28:33,297 --> 00:28:38,218
It does have a future,
But I can not see.

209
00:28:48,145 --> 00:28:50,606
You do not talk much, huh?

210
00:28:51,899 --> 00:28:54,776
Too busy to think of the future
l would bet.

211
00:28:55,152 --> 00:28:57,946
My uncle has told me that you
The future can see, and so forth.

212
00:28:58,071 --> 00:29:02,701
He says, the money, the casinos
The stock market. You know everything.

213
00:29:03,118 --> 00:29:05,954
Do you know where that reminds me?
Have you ever seen that movie, Krull?

214
00:29:06,246 --> 00:29:07,956
Since that plays Cyclop in...

215
00:29:08,081 --> 00:29:11,919
And it is so, because he is an eye
Had exchange for the future.

216
00:29:12,211 --> 00:29:14,338
But a long story short...

217
00:29:23,931 --> 00:29:27,601
Came the evil warlord
Deceived that bastard...

218
00:29:27,726 --> 00:29:30,687
And the only future that he could see
Was his own death.

219
00:29:30,812 --> 00:29:34,233
Man, that was zanie.

220
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:37,945
What's the plan tonight?

221
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:42,908
Are we getting something to drink first,
Or is it immediately...

222
00:29:42,991 --> 00:29:45,494
To the pussies.
-- Tonight we work.

223
00:29:56,129 --> 00:29:59,383
He's not.
Come back next week but.

224
00:30:04,596 --> 00:30:08,433
He is in the hospital.
There is a mole removed by him.

225
00:30:09,601 --> 00:30:12,354
Come back next week.

226
00:30:16,024 --> 00:30:18,652
Do you like that, baby?

227
00:30:19,528 --> 00:30:22,156
I have told you, next week.

228
00:30:22,698 --> 00:30:25,534
No, you will now pay old tart.

229
00:30:25,659 --> 00:30:28,912
Otherwise we go into the bunch
Still a little verkloten.

230
00:30:46,805 --> 00:30:48,932
Dude.

231
00:30:49,725 --> 00:30:53,270
Why you helped me, I
There was sewn by Moby Dick.

232
00:30:53,353 --> 00:30:58,150
What do you think, we go back?
Shall we die together trut rams?

233
00:30:58,609 --> 00:31:01,403
Where did they damn well?

234
00:31:21,131 --> 00:31:23,258
I am not.

235
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,938
Are you at the bleeding?
-- I do not know.

236
00:31:37,189 --> 00:31:39,149
Sta.

237
00:31:40,108 --> 00:31:43,946
Let me give you even more time.
I come back next week.

238
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:47,241
I want to see the money you have.
Or make sure the Fingers.

239
00:31:47,324 --> 00:31:51,495
Because if he does not get,
He takes one of these.

240
00:31:51,912 --> 00:31:54,206
You do not want to.

241
00:31:55,415 --> 00:31:59,545
I see you next week,
l am sorry of the message.

242
00:32:01,129 --> 00:32:02,881
Let's go.

243
00:32:18,814 --> 00:32:23,235
I have never seen such thing.
Verdomde cold ruthless junk.

244
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:28,615
You knew that there was trut.
How's that? What do you see?

245
00:32:30,784 --> 00:32:34,329
Enjoy you?
People so to beat each other?

246
00:32:34,663 --> 00:32:38,125
Sometimes hear that work.
-- Yes, but you enjoy it?

247
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:41,837
I think you do.
I think you do in life.

248
00:32:42,671 --> 00:32:46,884
Yes, it is done. Otherwise you do foreplay
The lottery, and that makes you here.

249
00:32:47,342 --> 00:32:49,553
I can not.

250
00:32:50,262 --> 00:32:53,640
How come, that you can not? You are
As a man who does what he is like.

251
00:32:53,974 --> 00:32:58,270
I can not do that because it is not
Shown to me.

252
00:32:58,562 --> 00:33:01,440
At the time that I see,
l go by.

253
00:33:06,278 --> 00:33:08,447
So you can...

254
00:33:09,239 --> 00:33:13,702
You can launch any girl fuck, and you know
Sure you are not sewn.

255
00:33:15,996 --> 00:33:19,708
Safe sex is something great,
l have heard that at least.

256
00:33:49,404 --> 00:33:51,740
That is my dream there.
Let me exactly where something like this.

257
00:33:52,074 --> 00:33:55,744
Music, chicks that fuck each other, while
Another brill to my balls sucks.

258
00:33:55,828 --> 00:33:58,497
Why are we not first
Go afterwards?

259
00:34:01,083 --> 00:34:02,960
It has a lot with him,
As an old man.

260
00:34:03,043 --> 00:34:05,462
Hello, boys.

261
00:34:05,712 --> 00:34:09,007
It is fine for you to see.
As always.

262
00:34:10,425 --> 00:34:15,389
This is Tony, nephew of Fingers.
-- Hello, how are you?

263
00:34:15,931 --> 00:34:19,685
I love you uncle, he is a lovely man.
Have you had anything to drink?

264
00:34:20,269 --> 00:34:23,105
I have a bit of a program...

265
00:34:24,022 --> 00:34:26,191
Got a flat?
-- Enough time to stay.

266
00:34:26,316 --> 00:34:29,903
That can always say, but I know
lt is not true.

267
00:34:30,404 --> 00:34:32,990
Whatever you want, ask for
Just about.

268
00:34:32,990 --> 00:34:37,578
Follow us but.
-- Tony is not so easy.

269
00:34:38,328 --> 00:34:40,706
Let us clothes off.

270
00:34:40,998 --> 00:34:42,708
Where is the room?

271
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:49,756
That old man there...
-- He and his men were regular customers.

272
00:34:51,633 --> 00:34:53,594
They do not share their pistols.

273
00:34:53,677 --> 00:34:56,013
Has he a gun?
-- He alone, nobody else.

274
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:59,099
You pay for the protection
Of Fingers.

275
00:35:00,225 --> 00:35:03,312
That is worth every cent.

276
00:35:06,148 --> 00:35:09,443
You know that you are always welcome
To stay.

277
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:16,450
I am not a hostess more,
Just as I do that themselves prefer.

278
00:35:19,661 --> 00:35:22,331
Can you do something for me?
-- Everything.

279
00:35:22,456 --> 00:35:26,585
Say that I am against Tony after my rounds
Come back.

280
00:35:28,086 --> 00:35:30,214
Sure.

281
00:35:40,265 --> 00:35:44,269
<i>lf you can see the future,
So you think that you can change. </ I></i>

282
00:35:45,103 --> 00:35:47,439
<i>But you are only a witness
Of the moments that are going...</ i></i>

283
00:35:47,564 --> 00:35:51,610
<i>Not in a position to help, even though
Would you want to. </ I></i>

284
00:35:52,027 --> 00:35:54,905
<i>And maybe you do not. </ I></i>

285
00:35:55,948 --> 00:35:59,618
<i>Sometimes you think that you assumed
ls something to learn. </ I></i>

286
00:36:01,453 --> 00:36:04,540
<i>About patience or remote storage. </ I></i>

287
00:36:04,915 --> 00:36:06,959
<i>But at the end, it all
About discipline. </ I></i>

288
00:36:07,084 --> 00:36:11,672
<i>Things see that you do not always want. </ I></i>

289
00:36:12,381 --> 00:36:14,967
<i>And through. </ I></i>

290
00:36:18,846 --> 00:36:22,850
<i>After a while, the things easier. </ I></i>

291
00:36:24,768 --> 00:36:28,939
<i>Routine ensures that you do not
Wanders into your head. </ I></i>

292
00:36:35,654 --> 00:36:39,283
<i>You start to accept things
As they are. </ I></i>

293
00:36:51,086 --> 00:36:54,923
<i>Every man has his fate. </ I></i>

294
00:36:56,133 --> 00:37:00,596
<i>You can not escape,
Even if you see it coming. </ I></i>

295
00:37:25,704 --> 00:37:27,998
Come on, baby.

296
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:09,081
Come on, rot.

297
00:38:09,164 --> 00:38:12,167
You are in the wrong room.

298
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:16,839
Touch me not to damn.

299
00:38:16,922 --> 00:38:20,926
Come on, that you should not do.
-- Tell me what I should do.

300
00:38:23,512 --> 00:38:26,181
We had just as a fun time...

301
00:38:26,473 --> 00:38:28,600
So go away.

302
00:38:28,725 --> 00:38:31,270
Quietly.

303
00:38:39,278 --> 00:38:42,156
Give that damned pistol.
You are wrong, this is not my fault.

304
00:38:42,281 --> 00:38:43,991
Let that damned pistol.

305
00:38:44,116 --> 00:38:46,535
It is not my fault that gun
Just went off.

306
00:38:46,577 --> 00:38:49,621
Then there is nothing for you to worry about it.
-- Do not closer.

307
00:38:49,955 --> 00:38:53,041
I use this damn ga
Backwards.

308
00:38:53,584 --> 00:38:55,794
Do you shoot all of us?

309
00:39:30,871 --> 00:39:33,457
I have done nothing.

310
00:39:53,602 --> 00:39:57,147
What should we do, you have the gun.
-- No, no massacre today.

311
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:15,541
What did you damn plan.

312
00:40:15,582 --> 00:40:18,335
<i>After a while, there is that effort
When you know that it's going to happen. </ I></i>

313
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:21,755
<i>We look at people
Moving slightly intention </ i>.</i>

314
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:26,468
<i>Or is it like to watch a movie,
When you know how it ends? </ I></i>

315
00:40:31,056 --> 00:40:34,685
<i>And then something happens that I
Will never forget. </ I></i>

316
00:40:41,066 --> 00:40:43,235
<i>l am wrong. </ I></i>

317
00:40:43,569 --> 00:40:45,988
<i>For the first time, the confidence
A detour. </ I></i>

318
00:40:46,071 --> 00:40:50,200
<i>And I see a glimpse of something strange
And new. </ I></i>

319
00:40:54,997 --> 00:40:58,500
<i>A future where everything
Can happen. </ I></i>

320
00:40:58,876 --> 00:41:01,378
<i>lt is something good. </ I></i>

321
00:41:01,712 --> 00:41:04,423
<i>And the feeling that it gives me...</ i></i>

322
00:41:04,882 --> 00:41:07,676
<i>Comes closest to what
l have ever felt...</ i></i>

323
00:41:11,263 --> 00:41:14,057
<i>With pleasure. </ I></i>

324
00:41:28,739 --> 00:41:32,201
Sir, can you tell me what
There with you happened.

325
00:41:32,784 --> 00:41:35,412
I do not know. Tell me
lt.

326
00:41:50,636 --> 00:41:53,013
That's my boy.

327
00:42:02,814 --> 00:42:06,318
I appreciate what you Tony
Already.

328
00:42:10,405 --> 00:42:13,367
How is it that you do not
Have to see.

329
00:42:14,701 --> 00:42:17,704
Do not worry about it but.
Make sure you just better.

330
00:42:17,788 --> 00:42:20,290
You have to go back.

331
00:42:21,959 --> 00:42:24,586
I need you.

332
00:42:25,838 --> 00:42:30,133
The boys who have done this with you,
l shall account checkout.

333
00:42:30,509 --> 00:42:34,555
Nobody treats my boy Sun,
Nobody.

334
00:42:37,432 --> 00:42:42,980
Chaos, rubbish, panic on the streets.
Your work here is done.

335
00:42:47,943 --> 00:42:49,987
Thanks.

336
00:42:52,906 --> 00:42:57,369
Do not worry. The pussies will
Surely in the row for you.

337
00:42:58,328 --> 00:43:01,165
Girls like scars.

338
00:43:02,124 --> 00:43:05,627
Just as a road map
For the soul.

339
00:43:08,839 --> 00:43:12,843
<i>lt is a new day, and I have no idea
What I should expect. </ I></i>

340
00:43:13,468 --> 00:43:17,639
<i>l can change someone's life
lf I do sense in it. The worse. </ I></i>

341
00:43:19,474 --> 00:43:21,685
<i>Of better. </ I></i>

342
00:43:23,437 --> 00:43:26,106
<i>That, I know. </ I></i>

343
00:43:37,576 --> 00:43:40,704
<i>A girl with a future that I do not
Can see, my life. </ I></i>

344
00:43:40,787 --> 00:43:45,918
<i>On the same day that my visions me
For the first time in the lurch left. </ I></i>

345
00:43:48,837 --> 00:43:52,674
<i>There are people who believe in coincidences. </ I></i>

346
00:43:53,258 --> 00:43:55,928
<i>But I am not one of them. </ I></i>

347
00:44:07,648 --> 00:44:09,191
This is old cake, he.

348
00:44:09,191 --> 00:44:13,862
Every ten minutes there will be another boy
Like me, you the same questions.

349
00:44:14,488 --> 00:44:15,906
That belongs to my work.

350
00:44:16,031 --> 00:44:18,992
I promise you that I will try
To make it interesting.

351
00:44:19,117 --> 00:44:22,412
For me it is a question to ask,
That nobody else.

352
00:44:22,496 --> 00:44:26,458
Nobody? -- Nobody.
-- You must trust me. It seems to be good.

353
00:44:26,542 --> 00:44:29,127
You are loved.
-- Forty seconds. -- Included.

354
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:31,672
Frank is here.
-- Where?

355
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:35,592
What does he.
-- It must be your agenda.

356
00:44:36,969 --> 00:44:40,055
Trista, thank you here today
Wanted to come with me.

357
00:44:40,138 --> 00:44:42,474
I do everything for you.

358
00:44:42,558 --> 00:44:46,645
Your first album, which gives you weather
As a great new talent.

359
00:44:47,187 --> 00:44:49,523
Is there pressure? Try you to the excessive
Media attention to compensation.

360
00:44:49,648 --> 00:44:53,193
It is not excessive media attention,
l am not just a pretty face.

361
00:44:53,318 --> 00:44:57,865
I have something to say, and I am so
Excited that my fans want to hear.

362
00:44:57,990 --> 00:45:02,411
Okay, but what difference you and with all those
Other songs beyond?

363
00:45:02,703 --> 00:45:05,539
I think it is my musical influence.
If you go back...

364
00:45:05,664 --> 00:45:09,001
What I mean is, you are young,
You are beautiful. I see you dancing...

365
00:45:09,251 --> 00:45:11,003
Why should we care that something can?

366
00:45:11,170 --> 00:45:15,465
I mean, what's yours
That is so special?

367
00:45:17,593 --> 00:45:20,137
What makes me special?
-- Yes.

368
00:45:21,889 --> 00:45:24,433
Nothing.
-- Nothing?

369
00:45:24,558 --> 00:45:27,519
Bedoel you, what makes me better
Than all the others?

370
00:45:27,811 --> 00:45:29,980
No, not better, but...

371
00:45:32,065 --> 00:45:34,359
Why you earn that?

372
00:45:36,403 --> 00:45:38,906
Why do I do that?

373
00:45:46,205 --> 00:45:47,956
What do you say here?
-- What does he?

374
00:45:47,956 --> 00:45:49,875
She is doing well.
-- I call it K.P.A.B.

375
00:45:49,958 --> 00:45:54,338
Almost nobody has that.
That is the gift of God.

376
00:45:55,005 --> 00:45:59,468
That, and I sing and dance well enough,
Millions of fans with them.

377
00:46:00,344 --> 00:46:03,138
It is something of hundred thousand more.

378
00:46:05,682 --> 00:46:09,144
What else.
That makes not much difference.

379
00:46:09,978 --> 00:46:14,650
I have fans who call my name
l also Ga.

380
00:46:15,067 --> 00:46:19,238
Come on, Trista. They do not call
Even your real name.

381
00:46:19,446 --> 00:46:22,533
Right?
-- What?

382
00:46:23,283 --> 00:46:27,204
I mean, can you at least we
Not even your real name?

383
00:46:29,832 --> 00:46:32,417
That I will never tell.
-- What do you think of my name?

384
00:46:32,501 --> 00:46:36,755
We have each other now met three times.
Three different interviews, you say...

385
00:46:37,130 --> 00:46:39,258
Everything you do for me.

386
00:46:40,425 --> 00:46:42,594
What is I?

387
00:46:43,136 --> 00:46:44,721
We are ready.

388
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:48,725
Quietly, what is the problem?
What do I do? -- You.

389
00:46:50,102 --> 00:46:53,564
That bastard will be on Thursday,
By the time I am finished with him.

390
00:46:53,647 --> 00:46:57,442
Bring me home.
-- We have that, we have a meeting.

391
00:46:57,568 --> 00:46:59,653
Take me in your leg?

392
00:46:59,736 --> 00:47:03,740
Do not worry, it's studio at ten.
It will be soon.

393
00:47:04,533 --> 00:47:08,996
Well, let dad on his wonderful Fingers
Blue eyes.

394
00:47:09,079 --> 00:47:12,541
That man has nothing against you, child.

395
00:47:15,669 --> 00:47:18,839
Fingers, what do you think.
Lives a dream, or not?

396
00:47:19,673 --> 00:47:22,009
You have destroyed my broadcast, Frank.

397
00:47:23,677 --> 00:47:25,179
It is a pleasure working with you
To meet.

398
00:47:25,262 --> 00:47:30,475
Fingers, that's cute. Should I now
lf you ask why they call it?

399
00:47:31,310 --> 00:47:35,105
I think that if I use talk
l already have my hands a lot.

400
00:47:37,399 --> 00:47:40,360
You are Trista, right?
-- Yes.

401
00:47:41,487 --> 00:47:44,448
Now we are friends,
We are down to business.

402
00:47:45,491 --> 00:47:47,784
Of course, Trista things go great...

403
00:47:47,910 --> 00:47:51,038
Be rotated singles, albums
Start to sell...

404
00:47:51,163 --> 00:47:56,543
The video is often broadcast, but there is
A big difference between a video on MTV...

405
00:47:56,919 --> 00:48:00,797
And between an artist whose headlines
Say that they are nice.

406
00:48:01,089 --> 00:48:03,800
As Frank says, is that someone you need,
You to the next level.

407
00:48:03,884 --> 00:48:06,553
Someone who opens doors.
Someone who is strong.

408
00:48:06,637 --> 00:48:08,972
You resigns.
-- No, I do not resign.

409
00:48:09,097 --> 00:48:14,895
I would step aside. A person
lts influence can be a superstar yours.

410
00:48:15,771 --> 00:48:19,900
He asks for things, and people give
To him. Please.

411
00:48:21,902 --> 00:48:25,489
I love to work with you.
I am totally committed to me your success.

412
00:48:25,489 --> 00:48:27,282
And the only thing I ask is,
You can bet for me.

413
00:48:27,658 --> 00:48:30,494
That is our appointment, that is our promise
We make each other.

414
00:48:30,577 --> 00:48:34,122
When someone our way...

415
00:48:35,123 --> 00:48:38,210
Then I rule that.
-- I believe this damn not.

416
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:42,172
Line a car for me. -- Trista, baby.
Fuck you, Frank.

417
00:48:48,011 --> 00:48:52,224
That was not so good.
-- That went very well.

418
00:48:58,647 --> 00:49:02,609
Tomorrow we enjoy shopping.

419
00:49:02,693 --> 00:49:06,405
You are still under contract.
-- Rot with contracts.

420
00:49:07,322 --> 00:49:11,243
I think I go.
Can you continue with her?

421
00:49:14,413 --> 00:49:16,832
I am back tomorrow.

422
00:49:25,632 --> 00:49:29,136
I am tired.
-- Yes.

423
00:49:36,059 --> 00:49:39,396
Do you love me, Danny?
-- Of course I do that.

424
00:49:40,481 --> 00:49:43,275
I also love you.

425
00:49:45,944 --> 00:49:49,364
Remove the light at?

426
00:49:50,032 --> 00:49:52,826
I do not like the dark.

427
00:50:00,459 --> 00:50:03,128
The girl is not nervous, do you?

428
00:50:04,755 --> 00:50:10,052
Do not worry. After school
l am here to wait on you, okay?

429
00:51:17,995 --> 00:51:21,165
Your friends will not help
You know that?

430
00:51:22,708 --> 00:51:27,129
No one will help you.
Nobody, but I do.

431
00:51:27,963 --> 00:51:33,135
Your manager has all your accounts
Leeggehaald for me to pay back.

432
00:51:33,844 --> 00:51:36,180
And that little piece of paper, which is
That you are the property are...

433
00:51:36,305 --> 00:51:39,141
Is the only thing that prevents
That he remains alive.

434
00:51:39,224 --> 00:51:45,647
And what does that mean? That means
You have nothing.

435
00:51:46,398 --> 00:51:50,194
And you are nothing, until I say.
And you are on tour...

436
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:55,449
And you still travel,
Until I see profits.

437
00:51:55,949 --> 00:51:59,077
And if I should ever come back,
We have a totally different conversation.

438
00:51:59,203 --> 00:52:01,580
Understand you me?

439
00:52:33,278 --> 00:52:35,405
Proost.

440
00:52:48,418 --> 00:52:50,504
Do you not think you have had enough?

441
00:52:50,629 --> 00:52:55,092
No, I think it is hardly enough.

442
00:52:56,510 --> 00:52:59,680
It may not be as bad as you think.

443
00:53:01,390 --> 00:53:05,519
You must be tired from it, to name
To have no idea of what you talk.

444
00:53:08,188 --> 00:53:11,859
Where was you actually, when Frank
Me at the sewing?

445
00:53:12,484 --> 00:53:16,488
Did you?
Hielp you him?

446
00:53:17,406 --> 00:53:22,411
No, of course not.
I am your girlfriend.

447
00:53:24,121 --> 00:53:26,748
Remind you your...

448
00:53:27,749 --> 00:53:31,920
How much it pays again
For my girlfriend to be?

449
00:53:36,049 --> 00:53:38,552
Alison, wait.

450
00:53:39,011 --> 00:53:42,389
Who will pay for the drinks?
-- I referred to it not the case, come on.

451
00:53:59,281 --> 00:54:04,912
Alison, wait damn. Come on.

452
00:54:10,209 --> 00:54:14,254
Are you Trista? -- What?
Are you Trista? -- No.

453
00:54:14,379 --> 00:54:16,298
Yes, you do.
-- No.

454
00:54:16,423 --> 00:54:18,634
Can I get a signature.
-- Sure.

455
00:54:18,717 --> 00:54:21,929
For Jake 'the hotty. "
-- Sure.

456
00:54:22,095 --> 00:54:24,515
Trista, my sister loves you.
-- I love your sister.

457
00:54:24,515 --> 00:54:26,975
You were great last.
-- Thank you.

458
00:54:32,022 --> 00:54:34,399
That hurts, damn.
-- Another photo.

459
00:54:34,817 --> 00:54:36,360
Take a picture.

460
00:56:08,202 --> 00:56:11,121
So I can leave?
-- Sure.

461
00:56:11,121 --> 00:56:14,291
What are you going to do?
Where will you go?

462
00:56:18,462 --> 00:56:21,840
There will be something to overcome.

463
00:56:21,924 --> 00:56:25,385
You are now Fingers his possession.

464
00:56:26,303 --> 00:56:29,598
He will do you edit you are exhausted.

465
00:56:30,057 --> 00:56:33,685
Jou throw away, which is what he does.

466
00:56:35,187 --> 00:56:37,981
What imagine that I must do.

467
00:56:39,566 --> 00:56:44,780
Fingers If you know that the legs,
He will come after you hunt.

468
00:56:50,744 --> 00:56:56,166
The only place where he will not come
Search, is here.

469
00:56:57,459 --> 00:57:00,629
I can see some money together to get...

470
00:57:00,712 --> 00:57:06,635
And then you can go far enough away with it,
Fingers can even order not to deal with them.

471
00:57:11,181 --> 00:57:14,017
Why you help me?

472
00:57:18,814 --> 00:57:21,191
I do not know.

473
00:57:24,361 --> 00:57:27,030
That let me just disappear.

474
00:57:29,741 --> 00:57:33,120
As long as I can remember...

475
00:57:34,705 --> 00:57:38,876
I myself have never let something...

476
00:57:40,252 --> 00:57:43,046
Want.

477
00:57:44,131 --> 00:57:46,633
Stay away from windows, and...

478
00:57:47,134 --> 00:57:50,470
Suit but all you need
From the kitchen.

479
00:57:51,013 --> 00:57:55,350
Tap nothing else.

480
00:59:51,425 --> 00:59:54,595
Is all well with you?
-- Yes.

481
00:59:55,179 --> 00:59:58,599
I am doing fine, it's just work.

482
00:59:58,932 --> 01:00:02,269
What have you done today?

483
01:00:05,063 --> 01:00:07,733
I have searched for you.

484
01:00:13,447 --> 01:00:17,659
I like what you here
Already.

485
01:00:17,868 --> 01:00:21,872
For us, as we here for a while.

486
01:00:24,875 --> 01:00:28,170
Who's that, in this picture
Together with you?

487
01:00:28,712 --> 01:00:31,423
Sparky.

488
01:00:32,049 --> 01:00:34,885
Were you well with each other?
-- Yes.

489
01:00:36,970 --> 01:00:39,389
That we went, it is...

490
01:00:41,433 --> 01:00:44,061
He died.

491
01:00:51,527 --> 01:00:53,987
What happened?

492
01:00:58,951 --> 01:01:01,745
I saw it coming, and...

493
01:01:05,332 --> 01:01:09,670
I could do nothing to halt.

494
01:01:10,045 --> 01:01:12,881
I know how that feels.

495
01:01:15,884 --> 01:01:21,139
It feels as if you never
Will be something like...

496
01:01:22,057 --> 01:01:24,726
Feel.

497
01:01:32,860 --> 01:01:37,239
Therefore, I have more scars.

498
01:01:41,201 --> 01:01:45,664
You know that the road map scars
To the soul.

499
01:03:01,907 --> 01:03:06,495
It's been a few weeks ago, I thought
Perhaps we could make a ride?

500
01:03:06,870 --> 01:03:08,872
Tomorrow?

501
01:03:08,956 --> 01:03:11,250
You go away?
-- Yes.

502
01:03:14,753 --> 01:03:17,965
What do you have in your hand?
-- Nothing.

503
01:03:18,715 --> 01:03:21,176
Something that I think that I have seen.

504
01:03:21,426 --> 01:03:24,555
It's not what you think.
-- What should you do?

505
01:03:24,638 --> 01:03:27,891
Do not worry about it.
It is for a friend.

506
01:03:45,951 --> 01:03:47,953
<i>With whom I speak? </ I></i>

507
01:04:21,778 --> 01:04:23,947
Piece shit.

508
01:04:29,870 --> 01:04:33,123
Three weeks, we are already looking
To that slut. Three weeks.

509
01:04:33,207 --> 01:04:36,251
Rondvragen, heads together,
You at my side...

510
01:04:36,251 --> 01:04:39,004
And all that time she was here with you.

511
01:04:41,798 --> 01:04:44,885
You would think that for you to death
Abandoned impaired idiot...

512
01:04:44,968 --> 01:04:48,347
That you had shown some mercy to those
Poor bastard, and had told me the truth...

513
01:04:48,430 --> 01:04:52,392
But no, you stood there and looked.

514
01:04:53,936 --> 01:04:58,315
You are a cold my friend,
A damned cold.

515
01:05:02,027 --> 01:05:06,240
What is this? Do you have something to put aside
Your little lady to take along on vacation?

516
01:05:07,991 --> 01:05:11,119
Is that yours?
I thought it not?

517
01:05:12,371 --> 01:05:14,706
Leave me alone.

518
01:05:17,835 --> 01:05:20,003
What's going on with you?

519
01:05:21,421 --> 01:05:24,758
In the past you had seen it coming.

520
01:05:27,302 --> 01:05:29,888
You lose the feeling.

521
01:05:33,684 --> 01:05:36,603
Say you anything against me?
Are you trying to say something to me?

522
01:05:36,728 --> 01:05:41,191
You put me in this situation.

523
01:05:48,198 --> 01:05:51,910
Do you think I am a bad guy.

524
01:05:52,452 --> 01:05:56,999
I will talk to you.
I am not a bad guy.

525
01:05:59,877 --> 01:06:02,796
I want what everyone wants.

526
01:06:29,907 --> 01:06:32,951
I try everything.
What happens? What do you benefit?

527
01:06:33,035 --> 01:06:36,371
That was not enough for you.
That was not enough, you wanted more.

528
01:06:36,497 --> 01:06:39,374
You have all the love of the world,
But that's not enough for you.

529
01:06:39,500 --> 01:06:43,587
So you took my friend, and put him
Against me. And then?

530
01:06:43,712 --> 01:06:46,298
You self piece of shit.

531
01:06:49,134 --> 01:06:51,386
I think...

532
01:06:53,388 --> 01:06:56,642
That you do not know what's for you
To be about.

533
01:07:45,357 --> 01:07:47,901
Tell me...

534
01:07:47,985 --> 01:07:50,737
What should I tell you?

535
01:07:51,071 --> 01:07:54,366
Your real name.

536
01:08:52,591 --> 01:08:56,053
The case is closed, you must skirt.
-- You must let me inside.

537
01:08:56,512 --> 01:08:59,348
You do not understand.
I am a doctor.

538
01:08:59,890 --> 01:09:04,061
You have to the front.
-- There is somebody dead. I must Trista.

539
01:09:05,979 --> 01:09:07,481
I must Trista.

540
01:09:07,481 --> 01:09:11,026
Come on man, I am a doctor.

541
01:09:11,610 --> 01:09:15,197
If she dies, it is your fault.

542
01:09:15,280 --> 01:09:16,740
<i>Everyone has a purpose. </ I></i>

543
01:09:16,824 --> 01:09:21,119
<i>Sometimes someone lives his entire life without
To know what his own. </ I></i>

544
01:09:21,370 --> 01:09:23,872
<i>l do not. I knew it when I was ten. </ I></i>

545
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:32,631
<i>My goal is to the right person
To keep sacred and accurate. </ I></i>

546
01:09:33,924 --> 01:09:37,719
<i>When I was ten, was one
Heidi Fontell </ i>.</i>

547
01:09:41,723 --> 01:09:44,143
<i>But when Heidi's father with his family
Was moving...</ i></i>

548
01:09:44,226 --> 01:09:48,397
<i>Knew I sure am back of someone
Went. And fast. </ I></i>

549
01:09:50,399 --> 01:09:52,568
<i>l was wrong. </ I></i>

550
01:09:57,156 --> 01:09:58,782
<i>l met Gina when I
Studied medicine. </ I></i>

551
01:09:58,949 --> 01:10:01,410
<i>We were best friends. </ I></i>

552
01:10:01,410 --> 01:10:03,704
<i>My roommate Henry said,
That the kind of girl she was, </ i></i>

553
01:10:03,704 --> 01:10:05,622
<i>You waited to get married. </ I></i>

554
01:10:06,123 --> 01:10:09,126
<i>But, I waited too long. </ I></i>

555
01:10:10,127 --> 01:10:13,630
<i>She married Henry immediately after school.
And I was the witness. </ I></i>

556
01:10:13,714 --> 01:10:17,634
<i>And all these years later, I think
That I still am. </ I></i>

557
01:10:21,346 --> 01:10:22,973
Where were we stayed.

558
01:10:23,223 --> 01:10:26,643
Henry tried a clear position
lt.

559
01:10:26,894 --> 01:10:29,771
About that you would go with him
The plastic? -- What else?

560
01:10:30,105 --> 01:10:32,983
Bob is rich.
That is not true.

561
01:10:33,275 --> 01:10:36,904
Derrick studied almost impossible.
And Derrick is strontrijk.

562
01:10:36,987 --> 01:10:38,947
It is not all about money.

563
01:10:39,072 --> 01:10:43,327
You stop it in time, you are doing the work.
Since you want to be compensated.

564
01:10:43,660 --> 01:10:46,079
It goes well with me.
-- It goes well with a lot of people.

565
01:10:46,163 --> 01:10:49,041
It goes well with her, that's where
She is the waitress.

566
01:10:49,333 --> 01:10:51,919
Anyone else I know, strontrijk.
-- I do not.

567
01:10:52,002 --> 01:10:56,298
You argue ingenious research. What a day
Leads to a great discovery.

568
01:10:56,924 --> 01:10:59,927
And that leads to patents, and then
We talk about very rich.

569
01:11:00,219 --> 01:11:02,513
There is nothing wrong, if they live
Of people trying to do better.

570
01:11:02,638 --> 01:11:06,850
No, it's great. Therefore I also love
Hers. I make people's lives better.

571
01:11:08,811 --> 01:11:12,981
That I do. Okay, I admit it.

572
01:11:13,106 --> 01:11:16,485
Work on tits and botox
That pays for my great car.

573
01:11:16,985 --> 01:11:21,114
Consider this view. A girl is born
With a nose on the ground that you can finish.

574
01:11:21,740 --> 01:11:24,660
There is no date for the eindfeest
For this girl. None shy first kiss.

575
01:11:24,743 --> 01:11:27,287
She comes into action, and of course
You lapt her fine.

576
01:11:27,412 --> 01:11:32,376
Eventually this girl wrote a farewell -
Letter to her cat, and jumps from one roof.

577
01:11:32,543 --> 01:11:35,212
The same girl comes to me...

578
01:11:35,504 --> 01:11:38,507
I use a little magic, and my friend
That letter will never be written.

579
01:11:38,674 --> 01:11:41,510
I have saved her life.

580
01:11:43,345 --> 01:11:45,681
I have saved a life today.

581
01:11:46,098 --> 01:11:49,017
Maybe I have also known,
You know it but never.

582
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:54,022
But anyway, I sleep tonight
ln a damn big house.

583
01:11:55,190 --> 01:11:57,317
I must urination.

584
01:11:57,860 --> 01:12:00,696
My husband.
-- Your husband.

585
01:12:06,618 --> 01:12:09,621
How is it with the snakes?
-- They are great.

586
01:12:09,913 --> 01:12:13,333
The times demolish me very much.
-- Feel you yourself?

587
01:12:13,959 --> 01:12:17,671
Exhausted. I fight against a cold.
-- I wish you came to me tomorrow.

588
01:12:17,754 --> 01:12:20,716
I would not bother you.
-- That is impossible.

589
01:12:20,716 --> 01:12:23,635
That lets you know right?

590
01:12:24,761 --> 01:12:26,763
Make good for yourself.

591
01:12:29,475 --> 01:12:31,685
Think about what I said.

592
01:12:35,606 --> 01:12:39,193
Ga you in that direction?
-- I parked at the back.

593
01:12:40,152 --> 01:12:43,238
Is it well with you?
-- Yes, I am used to them.

594
01:12:44,656 --> 01:12:47,451
I love you.
-- I also love you.

595
01:12:56,585 --> 01:12:59,254
Bring me the dossier.

596
01:13:02,508 --> 01:13:05,719
You will cure haemophilia, small boy.

597
01:13:07,721 --> 01:13:10,724
This is not ratelslang.
Want tool?

598
01:13:11,642 --> 01:13:13,852
Do not worry.

599
01:13:17,064 --> 01:13:19,858
What we have to do?
-- A slangenbeet.

600
01:13:22,861 --> 01:13:26,615
They gave us the wrong antidote
. They must now have a transfusion.

601
01:13:26,865 --> 01:13:28,992
Gina, can you hear me?

602
01:13:29,660 --> 01:13:32,996
Now awake. What?

603
01:13:35,666 --> 01:13:37,084
What did they?
-- I am not sure.

604
01:13:37,084 --> 01:13:38,836
Something about her blood. See what
Blood for it.

605
01:13:39,878 --> 01:13:42,422
Well, tell me about that snake.
-- You do not understand.

606
01:13:42,548 --> 01:13:44,800
It's been in her heart, she
Has a transfusion.

607
01:13:45,133 --> 01:13:48,387
Send me now that blood.
-- It has twenty-four hours.

608
01:13:52,975 --> 01:13:55,227
Here is the blood.

609
01:13:56,770 --> 01:14:00,023
What is this on?
-- The lab says it is extremely rare.

610
01:14:00,399 --> 01:14:03,026
Do we have this in stock?
-- I have never seen here.

611
01:14:03,318 --> 01:14:05,279
Check again.
Do it simply.

612
01:14:06,029 --> 01:14:10,075
Has Gina something of her own blood
ln stock?

613
01:14:11,994 --> 01:14:15,289
Listen, it is bitten.

614
01:14:16,415 --> 01:14:19,418
Look again, it's very rare.
She is too weak, it is too late.

615
01:14:28,135 --> 01:14:31,263
We have not, I
The checked into the computer.

616
01:14:31,638 --> 01:14:34,892
We have her blood.

617
01:14:45,819 --> 01:14:48,739
What do you mean?
-- Wait, you understand not.

618
01:14:48,739 --> 01:14:50,365
You need to let me go.

619
01:14:50,491 --> 01:14:51,909
You understand it is not, it goes dead.

620
01:14:56,622 --> 01:14:59,333
It is good. Let me go.

621
01:15:00,417 --> 01:15:02,628
It is fine with me.

622
01:15:11,553 --> 01:15:13,764
<i>l am here directly from the studio
Palm Hills...</ i></i>

623
01:15:13,764 --> 01:15:16,517
<i>Where Trista began with the recognition
Half of its music. </ I></i>

624
01:15:16,642 --> 01:15:19,311
<i>We may not bring within,
ln the actual recording...</ i></i>

625
01:15:19,436 --> 01:15:22,815
<i>But while we wait, watch
We still agree to a recent interview...</ i></i>

626
01:15:22,940 --> 01:15:27,319
<i>Which everyone wondered, pop superstar,
Or pop collapse? </ I></i>

627
01:15:27,611 --> 01:15:29,863
<i>What makes me special?
-- Yes. </ I></i>

628
01:15:30,155 --> 01:15:31,824
<i>Nothing.
-- Nothing? </ I></i>

629
01:15:31,990 --> 01:15:35,285
<i>You mean what makes me better,
Than everyone else? -- No. </ I></i>

630
01:15:35,369 --> 01:15:41,291
<i>Not better, just why you deserve that?
-- Why that I earn? </ I></i>

631
01:15:41,291 --> 01:15:44,920
<i>l have a special blood.
What do you think of them? </ I></i>

632
01:15:45,379 --> 01:15:48,882
<i>A blood?
-- Yes, it is called K.P.A.B. </ i></i>

633
01:15:49,341 --> 01:15:53,846
<i>Almost nobody has that.
That's my gift from God. </ I></i>

634
01:16:18,245 --> 01:16:22,374
I have spoken with the director, and said
No more than two pictures for that song.

635
01:16:25,169 --> 01:16:27,921
Is it good?
Do you need some air?

636
01:16:28,297 --> 01:16:30,090
I think you need some air.

637
01:16:30,382 --> 01:16:33,552
Can anyone please go backwards,
She has some air.

638
01:16:35,846 --> 01:16:38,390
I believe it. Reverse.

639
01:16:44,563 --> 01:16:47,441
Do this about.
-- What is going on?

640
01:16:47,483 --> 01:16:49,860
Your plane ticket and passport are
ln the pocket.

641
01:16:49,902 --> 01:16:54,072
The gate is closed, you have to the front.
-- You need me admitted.

642
01:16:54,823 --> 01:16:56,200
Wait.

643
01:16:57,701 --> 01:16:58,827
Call nobody.

644
01:16:58,911 --> 01:17:03,290
Keep your gedeisd a while. Give me some time,
l make sure that someone you can achieve.

645
01:17:03,290 --> 01:17:05,792
I am a doctor.

646
01:17:05,876 --> 01:17:08,003
It goes damn death, and
lt is your fault.

647
01:17:09,421 --> 01:17:12,132
It goes damn dead.

648
01:17:21,350 --> 01:17:25,062
Trista, wait.
-- No, step.

649
01:18:14,069 --> 01:18:18,073
I have shifted your performances,
And your video recordings will be cancelled.

650
01:18:21,285 --> 01:18:25,414
I am not angry with you, even though I know...

651
01:18:25,998 --> 01:18:30,794
That you tried away.
But I am not angry with you.

652
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:34,339
If you wanted to tell me?

653
01:18:35,549 --> 01:18:38,719
What should I tell you?
-- About the Baby.

654
01:18:39,011 --> 01:18:42,389
Am I pregnant?
-- Three weeks.

655
01:18:48,729 --> 01:18:51,023
Did you not?

656
01:18:58,697 --> 01:19:02,743
It seems to be good, I know
What you were trying to do.

657
01:19:03,076 --> 01:19:07,289
Do you think the whole world you love?
It is a damn dangerous life.

658
01:19:07,706 --> 01:19:11,460
You can not only do, I go for
You. I make sure it happens.

659
01:19:12,002 --> 01:19:13,670
All your dreams will come true.

660
01:19:13,670 --> 01:19:16,131
For that to be put aside, it would mean
That he died for nothing.

661
01:19:16,757 --> 01:19:18,717
That would mean that you him
Have killed for nothing.

662
01:19:18,717 --> 01:19:21,220
No, we have an appointment.

663
01:19:21,512 --> 01:19:25,933
He stood in the way, I have done my part.
Now it's time to do your part.

01:19:26,266 --> 01:19:30,479
We have a special someone
Lost. Now is the time to proceed.

Until the day that I will be dead,
l will hate you.

You can not keep the baby.
-- What?

01:19:53,335 --> 01:19:56,755
You have concerts and TV appearances,
You can not keep the baby.

669
01:19:56,839 --> 01:20:03,512
It is my baby.
-- Nobody is our way. Nobody.

670
01:20:05,973 --> 01:20:10,519
You have about two weeks a concert.
Enough time to be here with handler.

671
01:20:10,894 --> 01:20:13,522

You have saved a life today.
-- You are the.

676
01:25:20,913 --> 01:25:22,748
It's funny...

677
01:25:22,831 --> 01:25:27,419
If only that one little part,
And all the rest...

678
01:25:30,130 --> 01:25:33,801
I am glad that it goes well with your baby.

679
01:25:35,010 --> 01:25:37,513

As I can. -- Does not matter.

Yes, it will be good.

684
01:26:00,536 --> 01:26:03,914
It's hard, a fresh start.

685
01:26:05,290 --> 01:26:07,709
You are good.

686
01:26:08,627 --> 01:26:11,880
You too.
Thank you.

Not inside.
