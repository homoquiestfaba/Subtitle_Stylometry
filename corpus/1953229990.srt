VAMPIRES: THE TURNING
up by SpringBay, thanks to friends.

1
00:00:45,469 --> 00:00:49,940
<i>For centuries, Phii Song Neng have lived
among the villages of the Far East.</i>

2
00:00:50,829 --> 00:00:52,706
<i>Blessed with eternal youth...</i>

3
00:00:53,109 --> 00:00:55,623
<i>we vow not to take human life.</i>

4
00:00:56,549 --> 00:01:01,020
<i>But long ago, I broke the vow
and new vampires emerged.</i>

5
00:01:01,989 --> 00:01:06,141
<i>Jai tham: black hearts who feed
on humans and kill for pleasure.</i>

6
00:01:06,629 --> 00:01:08,380
<i>Only I can end the curse...</i>

7
00:01:08,381 --> 00:01:11,586
<i>and the jai tham's nightly attacks
on the innocent.</i>

8
00:01:13,029 --> 00:01:16,066
<i>In doing so,
I would end the entire bloodline...</i>

9
00:01:16,509 --> 00:01:19,182
<i>turning every vampire of Siam mortal.</i>

10
00:01:19,629 --> 00:01:21,904
<i>The only way my spirit can be free.</i>

11
00:01:24,629 --> 00:01:27,096
<i>Songkran, our New Year, approaches.</i>

12
00:01:27,097 --> 00:01:29,578
<i>The beginning and the end.</i>

13
00:03:57,229 --> 00:03:59,060
Look at that! Did you see that?

14
00:04:53,189 --> 00:04:55,543
I can't take this anymore.
Can we go, please?

15
00:04:55,544 --> 00:04:56,903
It's almost over.

16
00:05:40,949 --> 00:05:42,143
Amanda.

17
00:05:44,429 --> 00:05:47,704
- What are we doing here?
- I just wanted to see this.

18
00:05:47,705 --> 00:05:49,459
See what? Some guy get his ass kicked...

19
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:51,459
for a case of beer
and a carton of cigarettes?

20
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:53,824
I've studied and trained Muay Thai
since I was a kid.

21
00:05:53,825 --> 00:05:56,627
I just wanted to see the real thing
while I was here.

22
00:05:56,628 --> 00:05:59,905
How can this appeal to you?
All it is, is brutal fighting.

23
00:05:59,906 --> 00:06:02,708
There's more to it than that.
There's a philosophy.

24
00:06:03,749 --> 00:06:06,387
I love you, Connor. I always will.

25
00:06:06,388 --> 00:06:10,018
But this isn't working,
and it hasn't for a long time.

26
00:06:13,869 --> 00:06:15,746
Let's just finish the trip, all right?

27
00:06:15,747 --> 00:06:18,946
We'll go see some temple ruins,
ride the elephants.

28
00:06:19,709 --> 00:06:21,859
Whatever you want to do, okay?

29
00:06:23,949 --> 00:06:25,587
No, it's not okay.

30
00:06:28,229 --> 00:06:31,778
You've got plans, and I've got plans.
They're just not the same.

31
00:06:32,229 --> 00:06:34,663
- Where are you going?
- Home.

32
00:06:35,989 --> 00:06:37,183
Amanda.

33
00:07:29,389 --> 00:07:30,708
No, thank you.

34
00:07:47,829 --> 00:07:49,103
You look lost.

35
00:07:52,269 --> 00:07:54,941
I'm looking for the Crown Topper Hotel.

36
00:07:54,942 --> 00:07:56,303
Crown Topper?

37
00:07:57,469 --> 00:08:00,142
Chiang Klan Road. It's not far from here.

38
00:08:00,669 --> 00:08:03,741
I'm heading in that direction.
Can I show you the way?

39
00:08:05,989 --> 00:08:07,661
If you don't mind.

40
00:08:18,749 --> 00:08:19,864
Bad choice.

41
00:08:26,309 --> 00:08:28,698
- Down here?
- Yes. This way.

42
00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:35,342
Is this safe?

43
00:08:36,469 --> 00:08:40,428
It's the fastest way to your hotel.
And it is very safe.

44
00:08:45,229 --> 00:08:46,662
You look sad.

45
00:08:47,309 --> 00:08:50,381
Someone as beautiful as you
should never look sad.

46
00:08:51,189 --> 00:08:53,703
- My boyfriend...
- Left you alone.

47
00:08:58,069 --> 00:09:02,347
And someone as beautiful as you
should never be left alone.

48
00:09:03,029 --> 00:09:07,341
You should be with someone
who can give you everything you desire.

49
00:09:12,029 --> 00:09:13,781
Please don't hurt me.

50
00:09:15,109 --> 00:09:16,462
Never.

51
00:09:21,949 --> 00:09:22,938
Connor.

52
00:10:16,989 --> 00:10:18,138
Amanda!

53
00:10:36,389 --> 00:10:37,583
Amanda!

54
00:11:12,669 --> 00:11:14,466
What did you do to her?

55
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:23,543
Where is she?

56
00:12:39,349 --> 00:12:40,748
<i>What the...</i>

57
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:45,868
What the hell?

58
00:12:46,589 --> 00:12:48,102
Get out of here.

59
00:12:48,789 --> 00:12:51,747
- Who the hell are you?
- I said get out of here.

60
00:13:00,349 --> 00:13:01,621
That just can't be happening.

61
00:13:01,622 --> 00:13:03,618
You're in the wrong place at the wrong time.

62
00:13:03,619 --> 00:13:05,586
Take whatever luck you have left and go.

63
00:13:05,587 --> 00:13:07,625
- Leave!
- Listen, please.

64
00:13:08,149 --> 00:13:10,343
- They took my girlfriend.
- Don't go after her.

65
00:13:10,344 --> 00:13:13,306
You'll just get yourself killed.
And don't go to the police.

66
00:13:13,307 --> 00:13:15,300
- It'll do no good.
- What am I supposed to do?

67
00:13:15,301 --> 00:13:17,345
Walk away while you still can.

68
00:13:19,669 --> 00:13:21,739
I can't just leave her here.

69
00:13:22,709 --> 00:13:24,301
You gotta help me.

70
00:13:24,709 --> 00:13:27,018
You follow me and I'll kill you.

71
00:15:21,669 --> 00:15:24,785
<i>Sorry for delay.
Everybody here to celebrate Songkran.</i>

72
00:15:24,786 --> 00:15:27,702
Biggest festival of the year. Very busy.

73
00:15:28,509 --> 00:15:29,988
What can I do for you, sir?

74
00:15:29,989 --> 00:15:33,539
My girlfriend was kidnapped
by these bikers.

75
00:15:35,349 --> 00:15:36,940
- You saw this happen?
- Yeah.

76
00:15:36,941 --> 00:15:39,384
- Where?
- The Phang Nga Market.

77
00:15:40,109 --> 00:15:42,702
I was looking for her,
she came out of this alley...

78
00:15:42,703 --> 00:15:45,621
and she was on the back
of one of these bikes.

79
00:15:45,622 --> 00:15:48,268
And it looked like she was unconscious.

80
00:15:48,269 --> 00:15:51,021
And I ended up getting into a fight
with one of these guys.

81
00:15:51,022 --> 00:15:53,144
Then this other guy came
and he helped me out.

82
00:15:53,145 --> 00:15:55,901
I think he knows something
but he wouldn't tell me anything.

83
00:15:55,902 --> 00:15:59,664
So I followed him to this house
down in the Kong Sai District.

84
00:15:59,989 --> 00:16:01,865
Did you go in this place?

85
00:16:01,866 --> 00:16:05,464
No, I didn't go inside.
I thought I should come here first.

86
00:16:06,509 --> 00:16:09,865
- So you and the girl were not together.
- No. I mean, yeah.

87
00:16:10,869 --> 00:16:12,587
We got into a fight.

88
00:16:13,069 --> 00:16:15,377
So she angry after fight.

89
00:16:15,378 --> 00:16:19,461
- She leave to make jealous, yes?
- No. She didn't leave to make jealous.

90
00:16:19,462 --> 00:16:23,019
She was kidnapped.
Look, I can show you where it happened!

91
00:16:23,229 --> 00:16:26,744
No kidnap until missing 48 hours.

92
00:16:27,469 --> 00:16:29,027
Just like in USA.

93
00:16:29,589 --> 00:16:31,500
Go back to the hotel, see if she's there.

94
00:16:31,501 --> 00:16:34,625
Buy her some silk, go home together,
and everybody happy.

95
00:16:34,626 --> 00:16:38,223
Look, I called the hotel. She's not there.
I'm telling you, she's kidnapped!

96
00:16:38,224 --> 00:16:41,506
No, your girlfriend fine, okay? No problem.

97
00:16:42,069 --> 00:16:43,468
Everybody fine.

98
00:17:58,709 --> 00:17:59,824
Hello?

99
00:19:14,709 --> 00:19:15,778
Damn.

100
00:19:30,029 --> 00:19:31,462
Anyone there?

101
00:19:45,229 --> 00:19:46,344
Hello.

102
00:20:46,669 --> 00:20:47,818
Hello?

103
00:22:21,229 --> 00:22:24,221
Settle down, Sparky.
Any move will be your last.

104
00:22:26,429 --> 00:22:28,545
- Is he a bleeder?
- Don't know.

105
00:22:29,029 --> 00:22:32,101
Go inside, wake up Kiko
and find out what the hell's going on.

106
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:35,505
And get me a blood panel on this lad. ASAP.

107
00:22:35,506 --> 00:22:37,341
Who the fuck are you?

108
00:22:37,669 --> 00:22:39,580
<i>Why the hell am I here?</i>

109
00:22:40,629 --> 00:22:43,461
He's clean, sir. There's no sign of infection.

110
00:22:43,462 --> 00:22:46,142
<i>- You hear me?
- And you say he's just an outsider?</i>

111
00:22:46,143 --> 00:22:47,216
That's what Kiko said.

112
00:22:47,217 --> 00:22:49,377
He must have followed them
to the Kong Sai House.

113
00:22:49,378 --> 00:22:51,778
He's looking for a girl
that Niran fed on last night.

114
00:22:51,779 --> 00:22:55,417
- He's a liability.
- He's a tourist. He doesn't know anything.

115
00:22:55,418 --> 00:22:58,705
Smart enough to find Sang's nest
and dumb enough to go there?

116
00:22:58,706 --> 00:23:02,179
<i>- Now, that's a liability.
- You hear me?</i>

117
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:06,621
I'm looking for someone
who was kidnapped by them.

118
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:09,220
Why the hell am I in here?

119
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:12,937
The name's Raines,
and I want you to shut up and listen to me.

120
00:23:12,938 --> 00:23:15,907
You're way out of your league here,
my friend.

121
00:23:16,549 --> 00:23:19,905
And this search of yours
will only get you killed.

122
00:23:21,669 --> 00:23:24,660
Now, we're prepared to take you
wherever it is you're staying...

123
00:23:24,661 --> 00:23:27,216
help you pack up,
and get the hell out of Thailand.

124
00:23:27,217 --> 00:23:29,503
Wait, please. They took my girlfriend.

125
00:23:29,504 --> 00:23:31,704
She's not your anything anymore.

126
00:23:31,705 --> 00:23:34,177
If they haven't killed her, they'll turn her.

127
00:23:34,178 --> 00:23:35,987
Then she's fair game.

128
00:23:37,149 --> 00:23:38,297
Fair game?

129
00:23:38,298 --> 00:23:40,664
We're Slayers. Pro Slayers.

130
00:23:41,109 --> 00:23:44,181
$10,000 a head. Every head.
Girlfriend or not.

131
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:46,738
Wait a second, you can't kill her!

132
00:23:46,739 --> 00:23:48,820
Can and will, if she turns.

133
00:23:49,349 --> 00:23:50,827
When will that happen?

134
00:23:50,828 --> 00:23:53,184
Depends on her. It's her choice.

135
00:23:53,829 --> 00:23:56,468
If she fights it, they'll bleed her dry.

136
00:23:57,229 --> 00:24:00,221
Either way, she's dead.

137
00:24:00,989 --> 00:24:03,024
But you're alive.

138
00:24:03,025 --> 00:24:05,099
Wait a second. Let me come with you.

139
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:07,578
- There still may be time.
- Out of the question, me lad.

140
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:09,738
Look, I can hold my own. I can help you.

141
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:12,740
If the Song Neng hadn't saved you
in the nick of time...

142
00:24:12,741 --> 00:24:14,547
you'd be a dead man.

143
00:24:15,149 --> 00:24:16,946
Who are the Song Neng?

144
00:24:19,949 --> 00:24:22,827
Long story. One you don't need to hear.

145
00:24:23,269 --> 00:24:24,906
Just take my advice.

146
00:24:24,907 --> 00:24:27,741
Go to the police
and file a missing persons report.

147
00:24:27,742 --> 00:24:29,500
Look, I already did that.

148
00:24:29,501 --> 00:24:32,501
Then go home, Yankee. Forget all about us.

149
00:24:33,549 --> 00:24:36,586
One last thing.
Never mention the word "vampire."

150
00:24:37,349 --> 00:24:39,623
You do that and they'll think you're crazy.

151
00:24:39,624 --> 00:24:43,418
And crazy people kill their girlfriends,
if you catch my drift.

152
00:25:44,269 --> 00:25:46,988
<i>If they haven't killed her, they'll turn her.</i>

153
00:25:48,509 --> 00:25:51,262
<i>You're in the wrong place at the wrong time.</i>

154
00:25:53,149 --> 00:25:54,264
<i>Don't go after her.</i>

155
00:25:54,265 --> 00:25:56,544
<i>You'll just get yourself killed.</i>

156
00:25:57,189 --> 00:25:59,749
<i>Either way, she's dead.</i>

157
00:26:08,509 --> 00:26:10,578
This isn't it. It's down a little further.

158
00:26:10,579 --> 00:26:13,705
- Far as I take you.
- Well, it's just down the road a little.

159
00:26:13,706 --> 00:26:15,700
No go there. This is good.

160
00:26:30,429 --> 00:26:31,781
Get away!

161
00:26:31,782 --> 00:26:34,588
These are for Song Neng!

162
00:27:43,869 --> 00:27:46,337
<i>You make big mistake, farang.</i>

163
00:27:47,069 --> 00:27:50,220
You should do like they say and go home.

164
00:27:52,349 --> 00:27:53,623
Are you one?

165
00:27:55,829 --> 00:27:58,866
What you think? You lucky.

166
00:27:59,269 --> 00:28:03,501
They are feeding.
They pretty mad about you hurt Sang.

167
00:28:04,549 --> 00:28:05,902
You mean the girl?

168
00:28:06,989 --> 00:28:09,264
You get out while you can.

169
00:28:15,429 --> 00:28:18,023
<i>You crazy for sure, farang.</i>

170
00:28:44,669 --> 00:28:46,978
<i>I'm gonna tell you a story, farang.</i>

171
00:28:47,429 --> 00:28:50,660
Then maybe you leave and save your soul.

172
00:28:50,869 --> 00:28:51,937
Who is that?

173
00:28:51,938 --> 00:28:54,623
Niran. Master of the Dead Ones.

174
00:28:55,589 --> 00:28:59,343
Many years ago, Niran was a young warlord.

175
00:28:59,989 --> 00:29:02,867
<i>One day he saw the beautiful Sang...</i>

176
00:29:03,109 --> 00:29:05,178
<i>and wanted her for his own.</i>

177
00:29:05,179 --> 00:29:08,544
<i>So he killed her husband and son.</i>

178
00:29:08,545 --> 00:29:11,620
<i>What he did not know was
Sang was Song Neng...</i>

179
00:29:11,621 --> 00:29:16,225
<i>a vampire who lives on animal blood
and vow not to take human life.</i>

180
00:29:16,829 --> 00:29:20,458
<i>But in her pain and rage she attacked Niran.</i>

181
00:29:21,429 --> 00:29:24,420
<i>That night, during a Songkran eclipse...</i>

182
00:29:24,421 --> 00:29:27,659
<i>Niran became the first vampire of Siam...</i>

183
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:30,057
<i>who feeds on humans.</i>

184
00:29:30,058 --> 00:29:33,824
<i>And from Niran
came the many who kill for pleasure.</i>

185
00:29:35,429 --> 00:29:37,384
How long ago did all this happen?

186
00:29:37,385 --> 00:29:39,505
Over 800 years ago.

187
00:29:40,269 --> 00:29:41,622
Jesus.

188
00:29:43,949 --> 00:29:46,985
Wait, I've seen this place.
It's near the Phang Nga Market.

189
00:29:46,986 --> 00:29:48,900
Maybe this is where he took her.

190
00:29:52,949 --> 00:29:54,064
Hello?

191
00:30:19,789 --> 00:30:21,541
He's going after her.

192
00:30:22,709 --> 00:30:24,859
That could cause us problems.

193
00:30:27,029 --> 00:30:28,508
He loves her.

194
00:33:39,469 --> 00:33:40,663
Amanda?

195
00:33:54,789 --> 00:33:56,824
Oh, Connor. Help me.

196
00:33:56,825 --> 00:33:58,706
- Amanda.
- Connor.

197
00:34:04,389 --> 00:34:05,868
Please help me.

198
00:34:07,109 --> 00:34:08,258
Please.

199
00:34:09,869 --> 00:34:13,179
Baby, you all right?
Come on, we gotta get out of here.

200
00:34:20,349 --> 00:34:21,782
Come on, baby.

201
00:34:41,309 --> 00:34:44,506
- It hurts so bad!
- You gotta be quiet.

202
00:35:15,429 --> 00:35:16,862
Connor.

203
00:35:43,109 --> 00:35:45,225
- Where is she?
- She's mine now.

204
00:35:48,389 --> 00:35:50,983
You take a very big chance coming here!

205
00:35:51,429 --> 00:35:54,785
I kill you now and it's all over.

206
00:36:02,949 --> 00:36:04,063
Time to go.

207
00:36:04,064 --> 00:36:05,184
Kill them!

208
00:37:05,589 --> 00:37:06,704
Hang on!

209
00:38:01,989 --> 00:38:04,219
We have to get out of the light!

210
00:38:06,309 --> 00:38:07,378
Make a left.

211
00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:17,738
Hang on!

212
00:39:03,909 --> 00:39:05,979
- Now where?
- Straight ahead, into the building.

213
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:08,105
- Are you sure?
- Please, just do it!

214
00:40:05,429 --> 00:40:07,226
- Now what?
- Turn here.

215
00:40:10,749 --> 00:40:13,138
- Through there.
- You've gotta be kidding.

216
00:41:04,269 --> 00:41:06,464
Follow me. Hurry.

217
00:41:10,509 --> 00:41:13,182
I told her not to go.
We couldn't take the risk.

218
00:41:13,549 --> 00:41:15,141
Now the sun's up.

219
00:41:21,469 --> 00:41:22,822
She's okay.

220
00:41:23,349 --> 00:41:25,021
<i>Why did you come after me?</i>

221
00:41:25,749 --> 00:41:28,582
<i>You're strong, determined,
but you're not one of us.</i>

222
00:41:29,069 --> 00:41:30,865
That doesn't answer my question.

223
00:41:30,866 --> 00:41:33,304
Niran knows he has a new enemy
he must contend with.

224
00:41:33,305 --> 00:41:35,061
It may distract him.

225
00:41:35,309 --> 00:41:36,583
From what?

226
00:41:37,149 --> 00:41:39,344
What is going on here?

227
00:41:39,629 --> 00:41:41,858
How far would you go
to get your woman back?

228
00:41:41,859 --> 00:41:45,065
I just walked into a nest of vampires.
What do you think?

229
00:41:45,066 --> 00:41:47,657
- Would you die for her?
- I almost did.

230
00:41:48,909 --> 00:41:51,662
But, given a choice, would you?

231
00:42:08,709 --> 00:42:10,267
Please, no more.

232
00:42:11,709 --> 00:42:16,146
Stop fighting it
and the pain will go away forever.

233
00:42:18,789 --> 00:42:23,146
I can see it in your eyes.
You're thinking about it, aren't you?

234
00:42:24,429 --> 00:42:28,388
How easy it would be. How painless.

235
00:42:29,309 --> 00:42:33,541
The power, the endless pleasure.

236
00:42:36,709 --> 00:42:39,303
Decision.

237
00:42:44,509 --> 00:42:47,421
- Just end it, please.
- End it?

238
00:42:51,949 --> 00:42:53,940
We're just getting started.

239
00:43:09,149 --> 00:43:13,859
Leave us!
Rest and get ready for what is ahead.

240
00:43:19,549 --> 00:43:21,824
I told you not to get involved.

241
00:43:22,989 --> 00:43:25,946
- I don't have a choice.
- We always have a choice.

242
00:43:25,947 --> 00:43:28,020
Our choices define us.

243
00:43:29,469 --> 00:43:31,026
Like your woman.

244
00:43:31,027 --> 00:43:34,379
It appears that she's chosen not to turn,
at least for the moment.

245
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:36,778
But Niran can be very persuasive.

246
00:43:37,229 --> 00:43:39,788
And the pain she's experiencing is great.

247
00:43:39,789 --> 00:43:44,021
It's just a matter of time before she weakens
and turns into one of them.

248
00:43:44,349 --> 00:43:45,781
Then help me.

249
00:43:45,782 --> 00:43:49,703
We have more important things to do.
Give up this death wish.

250
00:44:01,629 --> 00:44:05,338
Look, whatever it is you're gonna do
has to do with Niran.

251
00:44:06,229 --> 00:44:07,787
Let me help you.

252
00:44:08,629 --> 00:44:10,665
And in return, you help me.

253
00:44:10,869 --> 00:44:12,824
I wish you could help us...

254
00:44:12,825 --> 00:44:15,217
but you're no match
for a vampire's strength.

255
00:44:15,218 --> 00:44:16,537
Save yourself.

256
00:44:51,109 --> 00:44:53,064
Are you sure we can trust him?

257
00:44:53,065 --> 00:44:56,619
Kiko will keep his word.
He knows he can't do it without us.

258
00:44:59,989 --> 00:45:02,378
By the way,
how many Slayers did you round up?

259
00:45:05,309 --> 00:45:08,426
Four more.
Two more just arrived from Hong Kong.

260
00:45:12,909 --> 00:45:15,981
Well done. So to speak.

261
00:45:17,989 --> 00:45:19,945
<i>I was once a Slayer like Raines.</i>

262
00:45:20,949 --> 00:45:23,543
Nine years ago, I was bitten in Lampang.

263
00:45:24,709 --> 00:45:28,304
We were taking out one of Niran's nests,
and I got careless.

264
00:45:30,229 --> 00:45:34,700
On that day, I was weak.
I didn't want to die, so I embraced it.

265
00:45:36,029 --> 00:45:37,747
But unlike Niran...

266
00:45:38,269 --> 00:45:41,545
I had no desire to spread this disease.

267
00:45:42,469 --> 00:45:44,983
So I became Song Neng.

268
00:45:47,469 --> 00:45:50,506
And you never satisfy your hunger
by taking human life?

269
00:45:58,389 --> 00:45:59,458
No.

270
00:46:01,829 --> 00:46:05,504
That's not to say that we don't have
cravings for human blood.

271
00:46:06,509 --> 00:46:09,103
But we've all sworn never to taste it...

272
00:46:10,069 --> 00:46:12,104
unless a human desires it.

273
00:46:12,105 --> 00:46:15,101
Some do, you know, crave immortality.

274
00:46:15,789 --> 00:46:17,268
Eternal youth.

275
00:46:17,789 --> 00:46:20,667
Yes. It's quite seductive, believe me.

276
00:46:22,389 --> 00:46:26,142
So what is this all about,
this thing between Song Neng and Niran?

277
00:46:26,143 --> 00:46:29,585
The Song Neng and Niran
have been at war for centuries.

278
00:46:29,829 --> 00:46:32,059
But we're about to end all that.

279
00:46:32,549 --> 00:46:33,584
How?

280
00:46:35,029 --> 00:46:38,260
Sang's spirit was born
in the darkness of an eclipse.

281
00:46:38,789 --> 00:46:41,507
<i>She can end the curse
by embracing the light of the sun...</i>

282
00:46:41,508 --> 00:46:43,977
<i>as it moves out of another eclipse.</i>

283
00:46:43,978 --> 00:46:47,698
<i>But only if this happens
in the exact place where the curse began.</i>

284
00:46:48,629 --> 00:46:51,541
<i>It's been 800 years
since the last Songkran eclipse.</i>

285
00:46:52,829 --> 00:46:55,866
She's waited that long
for her day of atonement.

286
00:46:56,909 --> 00:46:58,058
Atonement?

287
00:47:00,189 --> 00:47:03,420
Sang must die.
Her spirit will be reborn in sunlight.

288
00:47:04,429 --> 00:47:08,786
Then all the vampires that were created
from her first bite will become mortal.

289
00:47:09,789 --> 00:47:12,178
Yes. Alive.

290
00:47:13,189 --> 00:47:15,145
And all the killing will end.

291
00:47:15,669 --> 00:47:17,660
<i>Niran will try to stop her.</i>

292
00:47:18,189 --> 00:47:20,259
<i>He has no desire for mortality.</i>

293
00:47:20,629 --> 00:47:22,584
<i>He lusts after human blood.</i>

294
00:47:22,585 --> 00:47:24,659
That's what makes him stronger than us.

295
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:28,297
- So what are you going to do?
- We've made a deal with Raines.

296
00:47:28,298 --> 00:47:31,381
- Together I believe we can defeat Niran.
- And if not?

297
00:47:33,429 --> 00:47:35,989
Then we wait another 800 years.

298
00:47:36,309 --> 00:47:39,745
I tell you all of this
because I know what you're thinking.

299
00:47:40,469 --> 00:47:42,539
I would think the same thing.

300
00:47:43,189 --> 00:47:45,145
I see the way you look at Sang.

301
00:47:47,189 --> 00:47:49,749
She's very powerful, among other things.

302
00:47:51,429 --> 00:47:53,989
But do not mistake desire for courage.

303
00:47:55,829 --> 00:47:57,899
If I was to become one of you...

304
00:47:58,829 --> 00:48:00,626
I would have the strength.

305
00:48:03,149 --> 00:48:07,620
If you were to become one of us,
you'd be condemning your soul for eternity.

306
00:48:13,389 --> 00:48:14,868
Not if we win.

307
00:51:11,029 --> 00:51:13,418
Sorry. Your door was open.

308
00:51:16,309 --> 00:51:18,220
This was my wedding gown.

309
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:22,139
It was so long ago I hardly remember.

310
00:51:22,140 --> 00:51:25,301
But I loved him, I remember that.

311
00:51:27,029 --> 00:51:30,499
I've waited 800 years,
cursed to live like this.

312
00:51:31,309 --> 00:51:33,902
800 years is a very long time.

313
00:51:33,903 --> 00:51:36,947
A very long time to wait for death...

314
00:51:37,269 --> 00:51:38,463
and peace.

315
00:51:46,629 --> 00:51:49,188
What you are considering is very dangerous.

316
00:51:49,189 --> 00:51:53,148
And the more you're around us,
the more it will seduce you.

317
00:51:53,669 --> 00:51:56,388
But it is not life. It's death.

318
00:51:59,749 --> 00:52:02,023
But if what Kiko said is true...

319
00:52:02,024 --> 00:52:05,147
I'd get my mortality back
if we were successful.

320
00:52:06,789 --> 00:52:08,302
And your woman.

321
00:52:09,749 --> 00:52:10,943
Choices.

322
00:52:11,549 --> 00:52:13,426
Would you die for her?

323
00:52:13,829 --> 00:52:15,581
Would you die for me?

324
00:52:16,069 --> 00:52:19,026
- What would it be like?
- Everybody's different.

325
00:52:19,027 --> 00:52:22,066
But to turn, you must embrace it
without hesitation.

326
00:52:22,067 --> 00:52:23,547
Without doubt.

327
00:52:23,548 --> 00:52:26,507
- I don't know if I can do that.
- Think of her.

328
00:52:30,189 --> 00:52:31,338
And you?

329
00:52:31,749 --> 00:52:34,138
You and I are just a moment in time.

330
00:52:34,429 --> 00:52:36,306
A very special moment.

331
00:52:42,309 --> 00:52:43,458
Do it.

332
00:52:44,989 --> 00:52:46,820
Are you sure?

333
00:52:51,389 --> 00:52:52,663
Do it.

334
00:52:54,749 --> 00:52:57,866
<i>She... We are very lucky.</i>

335
00:53:30,749 --> 00:53:31,977
<i>Amanda?</i>

336
00:53:38,869 --> 00:53:40,746
<i>She's mine now.</i>

337
00:53:48,629 --> 00:53:50,585
<i>We always have a choice.</i>

338
00:53:52,269 --> 00:53:54,908
<i>Either way, she's dead.</i>

339
00:53:56,149 --> 00:53:59,266
<i>What you are considering is very dangerous.</i>

340
00:54:01,429 --> 00:54:03,385
- Come on, Connor.
- What?

341
00:54:05,069 --> 00:54:07,708
If you really want to know, just ask me.

342
00:54:13,229 --> 00:54:14,662
Did you?

343
00:54:18,709 --> 00:54:20,665
Amanda!

344
00:54:21,189 --> 00:54:23,225
<i>Would you die for her?</i>

345
00:54:25,629 --> 00:54:29,941
<i>It's just a matter of time before she weakens
and turns into one of them.</i>

346
00:54:34,109 --> 00:54:36,907
<i>It's quite seductive, believe me.</i>

347
00:54:38,189 --> 00:54:40,657
<i>You'd be condemning your soul for eternity.</i>

348
00:54:41,389 --> 00:54:43,266
Amanda!

349
00:54:44,109 --> 00:54:45,781
<i>Sang must die.</i>

350
00:54:46,189 --> 00:54:47,941
<i>Would you die for me?</i>

351
00:54:51,869 --> 00:54:53,348
Amanda!

352
00:54:54,749 --> 00:54:56,102
<i>Did you?</i>

353
00:54:56,949 --> 00:54:59,065
<i>It's not life. It's death.</i>

354
00:55:01,789 --> 00:55:03,108
<i>Did you?</i>

355
00:55:06,069 --> 00:55:07,707
<i>Think of her.</i>

356
00:55:58,749 --> 00:56:01,627
<i>The eclipse begins one minute after 3:00.</i>

357
00:56:01,909 --> 00:56:05,982
Totality lasts 17 minutes, 28 seconds.

358
00:56:06,189 --> 00:56:08,383
- No more, no less.
- That's not much time.

359
00:56:08,384 --> 00:56:10,424
That's what Niran's counting on.

360
00:56:10,425 --> 00:56:12,022
So what's your plan?

361
00:56:12,829 --> 00:56:15,468
This is the area where the curse began.

362
00:56:15,789 --> 00:56:17,745
We must get Sang in there.

363
00:56:18,549 --> 00:56:21,746
Niran has been checking the ruins
almost nightly.

364
00:56:22,349 --> 00:56:23,542
Planning.

365
00:56:23,543 --> 00:56:28,225
- How does he know what Sang's gonna do?
- He's always known, from the beginning.

366
00:56:29,149 --> 00:56:32,697
The Slayers will position themselves
before the sun's eclipse...

367
00:56:32,698 --> 00:56:35,256
all around the rooftops
surrounding the ruins.

368
00:56:35,257 --> 00:56:38,499
The unnatural night
will draw Niran out into the open.

369
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:41,467
The Slayers will be waiting, as shall we.

370
00:56:41,989 --> 00:56:44,583
Are you sure you can trust the Slayers?

371
00:56:48,989 --> 00:56:52,186
Raines is a Slayer. No more, no less.

372
00:56:52,909 --> 00:56:55,707
We're handing him
an entire nest of vampires.

373
00:56:56,229 --> 00:56:58,106
Oh, yes. He'll be there.

374
00:57:04,389 --> 00:57:07,539
Doesn't seem right that you should
have to pay for what Niran did.

375
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:09,425
You're a young soul, Connor.

376
00:57:09,426 --> 00:57:12,978
I've lived many lifetimes,
seen way too much pain.

377
00:57:12,979 --> 00:57:16,459
Value the gift that you wager.
To live out life...

378
00:57:16,989 --> 00:57:20,823
to feel the sun on your face,
to grow old with someone...

379
00:57:21,229 --> 00:57:23,504
and pray that you get it back.

380
00:57:37,029 --> 00:57:39,496
Tomorrow is our day, gentlemen.

381
00:57:39,497 --> 00:57:41,261
No mistakes!

382
00:57:44,749 --> 00:57:46,501
Heads on a silver platter!

383
00:57:48,189 --> 00:57:50,225
It's time to do some killing.

384
00:57:52,749 --> 00:57:54,546
No matter what happens,

385
00:57:54,909 --> 00:57:57,469
Sang must not feel the light of day!

386
00:57:59,629 --> 00:58:01,460
If she succeeds,

387
00:58:02,109 --> 00:58:04,020
you will know death!

388
00:58:05,149 --> 00:58:06,787
Maybe not tomorrow,

389
00:58:07,589 --> 00:58:09,898
or the next day,

390
00:58:10,429 --> 00:58:11,748
or for years!

391
00:58:12,829 --> 00:58:15,059
But it will come!

392
00:58:16,509 --> 00:58:17,783
Blood!

393
00:59:45,949 --> 00:59:48,543
- We're upstairs, sir.
- Perfect.

394
00:59:59,869 --> 01:00:02,861
- It's already started.
- How long do we have?

395
01:00:03,149 --> 01:00:04,582
About nine minutes.

396
01:00:29,629 --> 01:00:32,018
This is Raines. Do you copy?

397
01:00:34,669 --> 01:00:36,899
Position number one. Roger that.

398
01:00:42,269 --> 01:00:44,829
Position number two in place. Over.

399
01:00:45,389 --> 01:00:46,583
Number three set.

400
01:00:49,069 --> 01:00:50,297
Now we wait.

401
01:01:11,229 --> 01:01:12,662
Where are they?

402
01:01:38,989 --> 01:01:40,307
Moments away.

403
01:01:40,308 --> 01:01:42,300
Here we go, mates.

404
01:01:55,549 --> 01:01:58,187
- This is it.
- You see anything?

405
01:01:58,188 --> 01:02:00,658
- Not a living soul.
- How about a vampire?

406
01:02:09,909 --> 01:02:12,298
<i>Song Neng have the farang with them.</i>

407
01:02:12,509 --> 01:02:13,703
I can see that.

408
01:02:15,389 --> 01:02:17,857
If he gets in the way, take him out.

409
01:02:26,989 --> 01:02:30,026
- That's the place over there.
- How can you be sure?

410
01:02:31,149 --> 01:02:32,548
This is it.

411
01:02:45,149 --> 01:02:46,582
Time to play.

412
01:02:57,589 --> 01:02:59,898
By my count, I've got about 20.

413
01:03:02,109 --> 01:03:04,259
That's about right for this nest.

414
01:03:11,269 --> 01:03:13,783
- Is Raines here?
- He's here.

415
01:03:14,749 --> 01:03:15,784
I hope so.

416
01:03:31,949 --> 01:03:34,781
You know I can't let you do this, Sang.

417
01:03:34,782 --> 01:03:36,427
It's over, Niran.

418
01:03:37,149 --> 01:03:38,377
I don't think so.

419
01:03:38,378 --> 01:03:40,505
All you've done is spread evil.

420
01:03:41,989 --> 01:03:43,661
But I like spreading evil.

421
01:03:48,069 --> 01:03:50,299
<i>You've got a farang with you.</i>

422
01:03:50,709 --> 01:03:54,588
<i>Hey, farang, you cause me more trouble
than I like, guy.</i>

423
01:03:54,989 --> 01:03:57,457
So you gonna be the first to die.

424
01:03:57,949 --> 01:04:00,509
Whatever you've got, let's see it.

425
01:04:01,469 --> 01:04:03,778
Your woman is what I got in mind.

426
01:04:05,309 --> 01:04:06,378
Now!

427
01:04:49,589 --> 01:04:52,148
- How about now?
- Not now. Soon.

428
01:04:52,149 --> 01:04:54,424
Let the suckers tire out a bit.

429
01:05:27,509 --> 01:05:30,660
So Sang has tasted the real thing, has she?

430
01:06:08,029 --> 01:06:10,224
Where the hell are your Slayers?

431
01:06:10,669 --> 01:06:12,148
I don't know.

432
01:06:15,589 --> 01:06:17,739
Made a pact with the devil, did you?

433
01:06:33,149 --> 01:06:34,867
Time is running out!

434
01:06:38,309 --> 01:06:39,981
Raines!

435
01:07:28,789 --> 01:07:29,938
Ready, lads.

436
01:07:33,229 --> 01:07:34,264
Now!

437
01:07:37,109 --> 01:07:38,144
Good.

438
01:08:44,069 --> 01:08:45,138
Sang.

439
01:08:56,029 --> 01:08:59,226
That pretty little head
should fetch a pretty penny.

440
01:09:00,029 --> 01:09:01,461
What have you done?

441
01:09:01,462 --> 01:09:04,859
Killed a bunch of vampires.
That's what we're paid to do.

442
01:09:10,309 --> 01:09:11,901
You made a deal.

443
01:09:12,389 --> 01:09:14,903
You didn't think I'd keep it, did you?

444
01:09:18,389 --> 01:09:20,698
- He did.
- Kiko was a fool.

445
01:09:21,189 --> 01:09:24,420
If Sang ends the curse,
there's no more vampires.

446
01:09:24,789 --> 01:09:28,338
Every head we bring in
is worth lots of money.

447
01:09:29,709 --> 01:09:33,542
We're in the vampire killing business, lad.
And business is good.

448
01:09:33,543 --> 01:09:38,385
Less than two minutes of totality left.
Gather the heads together before they fry.

449
01:09:44,829 --> 01:09:47,946
Don't waste any sympathy, kid.
She's a bloodsucker.

450
01:09:48,829 --> 01:09:51,581
Don't you know? They killed your girlfriend.

451
01:09:51,582 --> 01:09:53,102
Niran did.

452
01:09:53,589 --> 01:09:56,386
- She had nothing to do with it.
- Whatever.

453
01:09:56,387 --> 01:09:58,744
Let me put her out of her misery.

454
01:09:59,949 --> 01:10:02,065
I don't want to see her suffer.

455
01:10:03,789 --> 01:10:05,858
Straight through the heart.

456
01:10:05,859 --> 01:10:07,541
And don't flinch.

457
01:10:10,389 --> 01:10:11,822
Put them down!

458
01:10:14,269 --> 01:10:16,703
Put them down, do what the man says.

459
01:10:17,349 --> 01:10:18,543
He's turned.

460
01:10:22,509 --> 01:10:24,340
- What do you want?
- Pick her up.

461
01:10:24,341 --> 01:10:25,703
What for?

462
01:10:26,549 --> 01:10:27,948
Pick her up!

463
01:10:39,709 --> 01:10:40,778
Move.

464
01:10:46,189 --> 01:10:47,668
This way.

465
01:10:48,629 --> 01:10:50,699
This way! Hurry!

466
01:10:51,349 --> 01:10:53,101
There's not much time.

467
01:11:07,109 --> 01:11:08,588
Tell you what.

468
01:11:10,989 --> 01:11:13,582
I'll give you the whole take from this kill.

469
01:11:13,583 --> 01:11:16,262
Niran's bloodline is spread all over Asia.

470
01:11:16,263 --> 01:11:19,022
- But we gotta hurry.
- Put her down.

471
01:11:21,069 --> 01:11:22,218
Gently.

472
01:11:28,309 --> 01:11:29,788
Now back away.

473
01:11:30,789 --> 01:11:32,142
Back away!

474
01:11:52,669 --> 01:11:54,068
Thank you.

475
01:12:19,229 --> 01:12:20,867
We're out of time.

476
01:12:21,269 --> 01:12:23,578
- You're not going anywhere.
- What?

477
01:12:25,949 --> 01:12:27,507
This is for Kiko.

478
01:12:35,149 --> 01:12:36,184
No!

479
01:13:10,269 --> 01:13:11,702
Amanda.
