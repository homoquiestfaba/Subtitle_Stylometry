[Man Narrating]
In the spring of 1956,

21
00:02:39,313 --> 00:02:41,440
on the borough
of Staten Island in New York,

22
00:02:41,515 --> 00:02:43,449
Buddy Visalo decided
to buy a house.

23
00:02:43,517 --> 00:02:45,451
You never try to
walk on a nail...

24
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:47,885
'cause that's where
the beams are.

25
00:02:47,955 --> 00:02:49,965
Looks kinda old, huh?

26
00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:51,896
The place was built in 1912.

27
00:02:51,967 --> 00:02:55,368
Plumbing is practically new.
I done it myself
a few years ago.

28
00:02:55,437 --> 00:02:58,736
And upstairs,
you got a completely
separate apartment.

29
00:02:58,807 --> 00:03:00,741
Eighty dollars
a month rent it gets,

30
00:03:00,809 --> 00:03:02,674
enough to cover
a mortgage payment.

31
00:03:02,745 --> 00:03:04,679
Assuming you're qualified.

32
00:03:04,747 --> 00:03:08,148
Two family.
You could quit
the factory.

33
00:03:08,217 --> 00:03:11,118
Now, here's the showpiece.

34
00:03:11,186 --> 00:03:13,586
That's a 40-foot
double parlor, gentlemen.

35
00:03:13,655 --> 00:03:15,919
Boy, the beat
the heating bill.

36
00:03:15,991 --> 00:03:17,925
Guess you could always
lower these ceilings, huh?

37
00:03:17,993 --> 00:03:22,623
She's the best buy
on Staten Island.
What do you think, Mr. Visalo?

38
00:03:22,698 --> 00:03:26,190
The 1200 my mother left me,
there's the down payment.

39
00:03:26,268 --> 00:03:29,897
You could quit the factory.
You know, rent to the tenants
upstairs.

40
00:03:29,972 --> 00:03:31,906
Wouldn't have to work.
Life of Riley.

41
00:03:31,974 --> 00:03:34,101
No, no,
no tenants upstairs.

42
00:03:34,176 --> 00:03:36,235
Estelle and I
live upstairs.

43
00:03:36,311 --> 00:03:40,475
Downstairs...
What?
What are you gonna do?

44
00:03:40,549 --> 00:03:44,315
Buddy's Tavern.
I have my own business.

45
00:03:44,386 --> 00:03:46,320
Your own bar?
Yeah.

46
00:03:46,388 --> 00:03:48,322
With that big fuckin'
living room,
Yeah.

47
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:50,324
With a bar
and some tables.

48
00:03:50,392 --> 00:03:52,326
What's it gonna take...
ten, twelve tables?

49
00:03:52,394 --> 00:03:55,124
Forty, fifty customers.
Put a guy in back.

50
00:03:55,197 --> 00:03:58,098
You know, break down a wall,
put in some live entertainment.

51
00:04:00,035 --> 00:04:02,833
Live entertainment?
Don't tell me who you'd get.

[Narrator]
It might be worth noting
at this point...

57
00:04:25,761 --> 00:04:28,423
that in 1945, when Buddy
was in the Air Force,

58
00:04:28,497 --> 00:04:30,556
he performed at
a special services show,

59
00:04:30,632 --> 00:04:34,693
which was attended
by Arthur Godfrey,
then a popular radio star.

# There's no tomorrow #

# There's just tonight ##

62
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:47,806
Godfrey offered Buddy
an audition when
he got back to New York.

63
00:04:49,551 --> 00:04:51,883
Buddy, Arthur Godfrey
or no Arthur Godfrey,

64
00:04:51,954 --> 00:04:53,888
the girl waited for you
for two years.

65
00:04:53,956 --> 00:04:56,823
You want to get married,
you got to have a serious job.

66
00:04:56,892 --> 00:04:59,656
But Buddy's fiancee, Estelle,
and her family...

67
00:04:59,728 --> 00:05:01,821
found the whole idea
embarrassing.

68
00:05:01,897 --> 00:05:03,762
Not to mention,
impractical.

69
00:05:03,832 --> 00:05:05,959
This is Arthur Godfrey,
for God's sakes.

70
00:05:06,034 --> 00:05:08,662
How many breaks
am I gonna get
like this again?

71
00:05:08,737 --> 00:05:10,671
Do you wanna marry me,
Buddy?

72
00:05:10,739 --> 00:05:12,673
Oh, Estelle, honey,
you know I wanna marry you.

73
00:05:12,741 --> 00:05:15,209
Then, don't do this.

74
00:05:15,277 --> 00:05:18,769
Instead, it was
a twin bed in a room
in Estelle's parents'house,

75
00:05:18,847 --> 00:05:21,111
until the newlyweds
were ready to move out
on their own.

76
00:05:21,183 --> 00:05:25,381
And a job in the machine shop
in the Anzelako Baked Goods
Factory,

77
00:05:25,454 --> 00:05:28,355
where Buddy's talents
went largely unnoticed.

78
00:05:30,526 --> 00:05:35,361
Meanwhile, Godfrey took a chance
on an ex-naval cadet
named Julius La Rosa,

79
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:38,593
who quickly became
an overnight sensation.

80
00:05:38,667 --> 00:05:41,101
I don't wanna hear it.

81
00:05:41,169 --> 00:05:43,103
It coulda been me.

82
00:05:43,171 --> 00:05:46,629
Even the much-publicized firing
of La Rosa a year later...

83
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:49,404
failed to dampen the fires
of Buddy's resentment.

84
00:05:49,478 --> 00:05:52,845
[Man]
That was Julie's swan song.

85
00:05:52,915 --> 00:05:55,042
Yeah, it was
right on the air.

86
00:05:55,117 --> 00:05:57,051
That poor guy,
you should have
seen his face.

87
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:59,349
"Lack of humility"?
What the hell does that mean?

88
00:05:59,421 --> 00:06:02,117
That means that
coulda been you. See?

89
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:04,784
What did I tell you?

90
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:07,954
So what.
Better to be La Rosa
without a job...

91
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:10,760
than Visalo
at that fuckin' factory.

92
00:06:13,602 --> 00:06:16,332
It was a watershed moment
in this marriage.

93
00:06:16,405 --> 00:06:20,102
Never again
would Estelle stop Buddy
from pursuing his dreams.

94
00:06:20,175 --> 00:06:25,203
Dreams which were now
understandably lower in scale
than they had previously been.

00:06:31,687 --> 00:06:34,087
A series of calamitous
business ventures followed,

98
00:06:34,156 --> 00:06:37,091
beginning with the first
privately-owned limo service
on Staten Island.

99

Buddy, nobody's calling.
Come on. Come in and eat.
Come on, honey.

100
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:45,423

had the slightest use for
in the little borough.

the design sensation of 1953.

We're gonna have
the whole house done.

have to paint again.

You're making chickenshit.

it came down to legalities...

'Cause you're on
the northwest border
of the town...

170
00:10:47,127 --> 00:10:50,756
covered under
the business statute of 1877.

171
00:10:50,831 --> 00:10:53,925
So, you don't need
the approval of the bar
and restaurant commission.

172
00:10:54,001 --> 00:10:56,970
That's lucky for you.
Those sons a bitches,
can tie you up forever.

173
00:10:57,037 --> 00:10:59,904
[Chuckles]
Hey, that's a great law.

174
00:10:59,973 --> 00:11:03,238
After the usual visit
from a relative
who happens to be a lawyer...

175
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:05,870
First right under
the contract of sale.

176
00:11:05,946 --> 00:11:07,971
Aren't there tenants
upstairs in our bedroom?

177
00:11:08,048 --> 00:11:09,982
And what happens
if they don't wanna leave?

178
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:11,984
Don't worry. Don't worry.
I took a precaution...

179
00:11:12,052 --> 00:11:13,986
of serving them with
an eviction notice.

180
00:11:14,054 --> 00:11:16,079
They got one week
to get out.
An eviction notice.

181
00:11:16,156 --> 00:11:18,090
I know you wanna
move in right away.

182
00:11:18,158 --> 00:11:20,251
We'll move in downstairs,
just till they leave.

183
00:11:20,327 --> 00:11:22,488
In other words,
we're sleeping
in the bar now.

184
00:11:22,563 --> 00:11:25,123
And after the usual
last argument...

185
00:11:25,198 --> 00:11:28,133
It's a great house.
I hate that house!
It's a slum!

186
00:11:28,201 --> 00:11:31,364
[Speaking Italian]
It's our chance, Estelle.

187
00:11:31,438 --> 00:11:33,804
Please, to what,
turn me into a barmaid?

188
00:11:33,874 --> 00:11:36,934
[Speaking Italian]
Moving day arrived.

189
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:39,308
Hey, it's a nice street.

190
00:11:39,379 --> 00:11:42,542
Listen, if it don't work out,
for some reason, God forbid,

191
00:11:42,616 --> 00:11:45,608
the bar don't work out,
I'll just rent
the downstairs out.

192
00:11:45,686 --> 00:11:48,280
Hey, hey, hey, come on.
Pick that up, will ya?

193
00:11:48,355 --> 00:11:51,586
What do you think?
There's the bay window.

194
00:11:51,658 --> 00:11:54,821
That's where the sign's
gonna go, the neon sign...

195
00:11:54,895 --> 00:11:57,693
Buddy's Tavern.

196
00:11:57,764 --> 00:11:59,698
[Buddy Continues,
Indistinct]

197
00:11:59,766 --> 00:12:03,793
Oh, Estelle.
I'm so sorry.

198
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:06,532
Don't worry about it.
We'll be in and out
in a month.

199
00:12:06,607 --> 00:12:10,509
A little paint,
a little polish.
Can you see it?

200
00:12:10,577 --> 00:12:12,875
[Estelle]
I can't sleep
with all these boxes.

201
00:12:12,946 --> 00:12:15,210
[Buddy]
It's just till the people
upstairs move, all right?

202
00:12:15,282 --> 00:12:17,409
A couple of days.

203
00:12:17,484 --> 00:12:20,885
I feel like I'm in
the luggage compartment
of a train.

204
00:12:20,954 --> 00:12:23,013
What sense would it make
to unpack everything...

205
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:26,287
just so we have to
pack it up again
when they move, huh?

206
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:29,557
[Glass Breaks,
Clattering]

207
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:31,564
Buddy.

## [Singing, Indistinct]

209
00:12:40,974 --> 00:12:43,670
Hey!
Hey, yourself.

210
00:12:43,744 --> 00:12:46,440
Would you mind keeping it down?
We're trying to sleep here.

211
00:12:46,513 --> 00:12:48,879
Go sleep in your own house,
you fat bastard.

212
00:12:48,949 --> 00:12:53,443
This is my own house.
I'm the new owner... Visalo.

213
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:58,184
Oh, you're Visulo.

214
00:12:58,258 --> 00:13:00,726
You, you're the one
that sent me...

215
00:13:00,794 --> 00:13:04,025
this-this despicable letter,
telling me to get out?

216
00:13:04,097 --> 00:13:07,294
That was my lawyer.
Your lawyer, was it?

217
00:13:07,367 --> 00:13:10,268
Hey, hey, hey,
hey, Vilony.

218
00:13:10,337 --> 00:13:14,933
You and your lawyer
come down here
and kiss my ass, eh?

219
00:13:15,008 --> 00:13:17,272
[Laughing]

220
00:13:17,344 --> 00:13:20,313
He lives upstairs.
Good. He can stay.

221
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:22,848
Where you goin'?
Home.

222
00:13:22,916 --> 00:13:24,975
You are home.
[Clattering]

223
00:13:25,052 --> 00:13:27,486
Hey, what the hell?

224
00:13:27,554 --> 00:13:31,388
I aim to please.
You aim too,
if you please.

225
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:33,426
[Continues, Indistinct]

226
00:13:33,493 --> 00:13:38,055
[Narrator] It was
at this moment the awful truth
became apparent to Buddy Visalo.

227
00:13:38,131 --> 00:13:43,034
His dreams of this success,
which he knew would be so sweet
after years of failure,

228
00:13:43,103 --> 00:13:45,571
were once again
to be foiled.

229
00:13:51,311 --> 00:13:53,245
[Bottle Clangs]

230
00:14:03,156 --> 00:14:05,090
Well, who are you?

231
00:14:05,158 --> 00:14:09,458
I'm Visalo.
We met last night.
Don't you remember?

232
00:14:09,529 --> 00:14:11,827
What if I don't?
Who are ya?

233
00:14:11,898 --> 00:14:13,832
I own the place.

234
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,834
The bastard
that sent me the notice.

235
00:14:15,902 --> 00:14:18,962
Yeah, yeah.
Uh, listen.

236
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:21,872
I don't wanna make things
hard on you or anything,
but, uh,

237
00:14:21,942 --> 00:14:24,376
me and the wife,
we ain't lookin'
to be landlords.

238
00:14:24,444 --> 00:14:26,378
Oh, you're not.

239
00:14:26,446 --> 00:14:30,974
No, no. The idea here
is for me and the wife to keep
the whole house to ourselves.

240
00:14:31,051 --> 00:14:33,645
Oh, that'd be nice,
wouldn't it?
Big too.

241
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:36,518
Yeah. Well, actually,
what I'm looking to do...

242
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:39,684
is turn the downstairs
into a bar, and we're
gonna live up here.

243
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,955
A bar.
Lovely idea.

244
00:14:42,028 --> 00:14:44,087
Yeah. It's been
on my mind for a while now,

245
00:14:44,164 --> 00:14:46,132
seeing how the streets
have all these businesses.

246
00:14:46,199 --> 00:14:48,133
Will you
be serving food?

247
00:14:48,201 --> 00:14:52,365
Food? Yeah, I don't know.
Maybe some sandwiches
and stuff.

248
00:14:55,342 --> 00:14:57,276
[Knocks]

249
00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:01,848
What?
I didn't get
to the point yet.

250
00:15:01,915 --> 00:15:04,475
The point is I'm looking
for you to vacate.

251
00:15:04,551 --> 00:15:06,519
I don't wanna make anything
too uncomfortable for you,

252
00:15:06,586 --> 00:15:08,520
so it doesn't have to be
right this minute.

253
00:15:08,588 --> 00:15:11,352
A couple of days will be fine.
Maybe even a week.

254
00:15:11,424 --> 00:15:14,916
Aren't you
the generous soul,
Mr. Visalo?

255
00:15:14,995 --> 00:15:17,463
I'm just tryin'
to be fair here.

256
00:15:17,531 --> 00:15:19,897
Let me tell you
something.

257
00:15:19,966 --> 00:15:23,094
The fact that
you bought this firetrap
from that prick, Mahoney,

258
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:25,263
tells me, above all,
you're stupid.

259
00:15:25,338 --> 00:15:28,330
And if you think
you're gonna come up here
and throw me out,

260
00:15:28,408 --> 00:15:30,569
you're even dumber
than you look.

261
00:15:30,644 --> 00:15:33,909
I got a wife in there
expecting a kid, so in spite
of your stupidity,

262
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:36,778
I'm sure you'll be able
to see I'm not exactly
in the mood...

263
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:41,150
to be thrown out
on the street by some
dimwit, two-bit Italian,

264
00:15:41,221 --> 00:15:44,884
who fancies himself
a restaurateur.

265
00:15:53,834 --> 00:15:58,237
Hey, Vilula.
I forgot, the rent.

266
00:15:58,305 --> 00:16:01,069
- What about it?
- I ain't got it.

267
00:16:01,141 --> 00:16:03,006
Ain't got it for months.

268
00:16:03,076 --> 00:16:06,512
If you think that's gonna be
enough to throw me out,
you're sadly mistaken.

269
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:08,912
The New York Renters
Association's...

270
00:16:15,288 --> 00:16:18,451
According to the New York
Renters Association,

271
00:16:18,525 --> 00:16:21,392
I've got another year
to live in my abode.

272
00:16:21,461 --> 00:16:24,487
A whole year, Visuli.
Did you know that?

273
00:16:24,564 --> 00:16:27,624
So, don't bother comin' up here,
knockin' on my door,
lookin' for the rent...

274
00:16:27,701 --> 00:16:30,636
because you won't get it.

275
00:16:30,704 --> 00:16:32,638
What's going on, Buddy?

276
00:16:32,706 --> 00:16:36,039
Buddy, what's going on?

277
00:16:36,109 --> 00:16:39,476
Buddy, look at me!

00:16:39,546 --> 00:16:42,811
Bud... Buddy!

279
00:16:42,883 --> 00:16:47,650
Come on, come in.
You're gonna hurt yourself.
What are you doin'?

280
00:16:47,721 --> 00:16:50,519
Uh-oh. "If said dwelling
has no more than
two in notice...

281
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:54,151
"and one rental apartment

built before 1913,

282

283
00:16:57,264 --> 00:16:59,289
It is covered under
the rental law of 1921.

284
00:16:59,366 --> 00:17:01,527
How is that possible?

My Uncle Louie would have
known better to buy a house...

290
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:20,246
and not ask whether the tenants
had to stay or go.

291
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:23,915
My uncle Louie, Buddy.
And he couldn't read or write.

292
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:27,926
Why don't we go
to Uncle Louie's grave
and ask him what to do?

293
00:17:27,994 --> 00:17:30,963
No, we gotta sell
this house fast, Buddy.

294
00:17:31,031 --> 00:17:33,693
Maybe Uncle Louie
will buy it.

00:17:38,571 --> 00:17:40,505
I'll take care of this,

in there?

Hey, open up, will ya?
[Yelling Continues]

301
00:17:48,581 --> 00:17:52,210
What are you doing to her?
What are you doing to her?
Open up the door!

302
00:17:52,285 --> 00:17:55,186
What's the matter with you?
[Woman]
Get away from me!

303
00:18:02,754 --> 00:18:04,312
Who are you?

304
00:18:04,389 --> 00:18:08,291
I'm Visalo, the landlord.
I heard a noise.

305
00:18:08,359 --> 00:18:10,293
[Clattering]
What's all this?

306
00:18:10,361 --> 00:18:14,559
- You broke my door down.
- You gotta be kidding me.
I could have called the cops.

307
00:18:14,632 --> 00:18:17,624
What right have you?
You broke my door down!

What, you come to inspect
the fuckin'damage, Visuli?

310

Hey, settle down, pal.

311
00:18:27,311 --> 00:18:31,941
Oh, Visuli, I meant
to ask you something.
It's about your figure.

312
00:18:32,016 --> 00:18:34,348
Your girlish figure.

313
00:18:34,419 --> 00:18:37,650
You reminded me of something,
I couldn't think what.

314
00:18:37,722 --> 00:18:39,656
Look, pal.
But now I know.

315
00:18:39,724 --> 00:18:43,285
You're a sausage,
Visuli, don't you know?

316
00:18:43,361 --> 00:18:45,556
Don't you see what I mean?
Short on the top,

317
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:48,155
short on the bottom
and packed in the middle,

318
00:18:48,232 --> 00:18:52,032

Hey, look. I've got news
for you, pal... you're movin'.

I got news for you.
You smell like
a fuckin' garlic press.

Joe, stop it.
Piss off.

- Hey, hey, hey!
- Hey!

322
00:19:01,045 --> 00:19:05,038
Oh, oh, she's your type,
huh, Visuli?

323
00:19:05,116 --> 00:19:07,107
Settle down, pal.

324
00:19:07,185 --> 00:19:11,383
You want a piece of her,
do you? Well, may it please
you to know that this lady...

belongs to me.

326
00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:17,656
From here,
down to here.
Stop it!

327
00:19:17,728 --> 00:19:21,789

00:19:33,744 --> 00:19:37,077
I suppose you expect me
to thank you.

330
00:19:37,148 --> 00:19:39,082
You know what?

331
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:42,517
You're as sick as he is.
You're even sicker.

332
00:19:42,587 --> 00:19:46,455
You're both sick,
and you're both
movin' tomorrow!

333
00:19:50,394 --> 00:19:52,328
[Buddy]
He would have killed her.

334
00:19:52,396 --> 00:19:54,694
[Narrator]
Naturally, news of Buddy's
drunken Irish tenant...

335
00:19:54,765 --> 00:19:57,893
and his ungrateful pregnant wife
soon made the rounds.

336
00:19:57,969 --> 00:20:00,369
He can't evict him.
It's about this law.

337
00:20:00,438 --> 00:20:02,531
Buddy, you know
what they say?

338
00:20:02,607 --> 00:20:04,632
"The only thing worse
than a drunken mick...

339
00:20:04,709 --> 00:20:06,768
is a drunken mick
with a broken fuckin' nose."

340
00:20:06,844 --> 00:20:08,778
Angelo's right. We should
just throw them out.

341
00:20:08,846 --> 00:20:10,939
Can't throw them out.
The guy's got rights.

342
00:20:11,015 --> 00:20:13,006
The guy in the housing office
with the bow tie...

343
00:20:13,084 --> 00:20:15,018
What about your rights
as a homeowner?

344
00:20:15,086 --> 00:20:17,020
Throw the guy out.
It's your house.

345
00:20:17,088 --> 00:20:20,387
Tomorrow morning,
throw the guy out.
Throw the fuckin' guy out!

346
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:22,585
You mean physically?
Throw him out!

347
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:24,787
Of course physically.
What do you think,
magically?

348
00:20:24,862 --> 00:20:27,626
Go down there,
grab his stupid
Irish mick ass,

349
00:20:27,698 --> 00:20:30,223
throw him down the steps,
out the house, outta the block,
that's it!

350
00:20:30,301 --> 00:20:33,532
Done! Finito.
[Grunting]

351
00:20:33,604 --> 00:20:36,038
What, are you gonna
be there?

352
00:20:36,107 --> 00:20:39,133
No, I'll send you
by yourself.
We're all gonna come.

353
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:40,802
I'm in.

354
00:20:40,878 --> 00:20:43,711
[Narrator]
The O'Nearys were to receive
three warnings...

355
00:20:43,781 --> 00:20:45,772
in the space
of five minutes.

356
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:49,513
If they didn't actively
begin moving their possessions
after the third warning,

357
00:20:49,587 --> 00:20:51,748
then appropriate actions
would be taken.

358
00:20:51,822 --> 00:20:56,054
Said actions remained vague,
but without a doubt,
involving violence.

359
00:20:58,196 --> 00:21:01,791
What are you doing?
You gonna warn them
or what?

360
00:21:01,866 --> 00:21:04,357
Yeah, of course.

361
00:21:04,435 --> 00:21:07,199
I'm just thinkin'.

362
00:21:07,271 --> 00:21:09,967
Should I go up there,
or should I do it
from down here?

363
00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:12,669
What's the difference?
Do it from down here.

364
00:21:12,743 --> 00:21:14,836
What if the shoutin'
wakes up the neighbors?

365
00:21:14,912 --> 00:21:18,712
- Who the fuck cares?
- Hey, it's my house,
all right, Danny?

366
00:21:18,783 --> 00:21:20,717
Go talk to him.
It's his house.

367
00:21:20,785 --> 00:21:22,753
What are we doin'here
early in the morning?

368
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:25,482
All right, all right.
I'm gonna go up there.

369
00:21:25,556 --> 00:21:27,854
Wake the mick up, huh?

370
00:21:32,496 --> 00:21:34,327
Wake the guy up, huh?
Buddy!

371
00:21:34,398 --> 00:21:37,925
All right, all right.
Stop shoutin', will ya?

372
00:21:55,219 --> 00:21:58,518
Wake up in there.
It's Visalo.

373
00:21:58,589 --> 00:22:00,523
[Knocking]

374
00:22:00,591 --> 00:22:03,219
Hey, wake up.
It's moving day.

375
00:22:03,294 --> 00:22:05,455
Go away.
I ain't goin' away.

376
00:22:05,529 --> 00:22:07,997
You're goin' away.
Leave us alone.

377
00:22:08,065 --> 00:22:10,761
I ain't leavin' youse alone.
You're leavin' us alone.

378
00:22:10,835 --> 00:22:13,065
Oh, shut up!

379
00:22:22,113 --> 00:22:24,547
Let's give him
a couple minutes.

380
00:22:24,615 --> 00:22:27,083
All right, okay.
So, uh, let's set
our watches.

381
00:22:27,151 --> 00:22:29,984
I got ten minutes
to 7:00.

382
00:22:30,054 --> 00:22:31,988
I got five of.

383
00:22:34,025 --> 00:22:36,016
Set it to mine.
My watch works.

384
00:22:36,093 --> 00:22:39,426
I got five of, too,
so maybe you should
set it to ours.

385
00:22:39,497 --> 00:22:41,431
Whose idea was this
to set our watches?

386
00:22:41,499 --> 00:22:43,433
[Buddy]
Enough with the watches.

387
00:22:46,737 --> 00:22:48,864
Jim!

388
00:22:48,939 --> 00:22:50,873
Jim, wake up!

389
00:22:50,941 --> 00:22:53,739
Oh, God. Jim!

390
00:22:53,811 --> 00:22:55,802
Wake up!
Come on.

391
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,871
[Grunts]
Hey!
Up!

392
00:22:57,948 --> 00:23:00,917
What the hell?
Aah!
Wake up. Come on.

393
00:23:00,985 --> 00:23:04,011
Wake up!
Jim, for God's sake,
wake up!

394
00:23:04,088 --> 00:23:06,022
[Gurgling]

395
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:13,223
This is your second warning,
O'Neary.

396
00:23:13,297 --> 00:23:17,734
Let it be known
that you have received two
of a possible three warnings.

397
00:23:17,802 --> 00:23:20,532
Go to the window.

398
00:23:20,604 --> 00:23:22,538
Why?

399
00:23:22,606 --> 00:23:24,972
There's men outside.

400
00:23:25,042 --> 00:23:27,272
Who?

401
00:23:27,345 --> 00:23:30,143
Go to the window!
They're gonna throw us out.

402
00:23:30,214 --> 00:23:33,513
[Buddy Yelling,
Indistinct]

403
00:23:33,584 --> 00:23:35,518
Visulo.

404
00:23:40,324 --> 00:23:42,258
Visuli,

405
00:23:42,326 --> 00:23:45,818
if you and your band
of fat-ass dagos...

406
00:23:45,896 --> 00:23:48,592
wanna be responsible
for breaking the law...

407
00:23:48,666 --> 00:23:52,158
and dispossessin' me,
well, that's fine,
I'll see you in court.

408
00:23:52,236 --> 00:23:54,170
How do you like this guy?

409
00:23:54,238 --> 00:23:58,106
He ain't takin' no one to court.
You know how expensive that is?

410
00:23:58,175 --> 00:24:02,612
But if you wanna be responsible
for harmin' a pregnant woman
and an unborn child,

411
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:05,513
you'll have to
harm me too.

412
00:24:05,583 --> 00:24:08,609
And that encounter
will surely prove fatal...

413
00:24:08,686 --> 00:24:10,620
to all of you.

414
00:24:11,856 --> 00:24:15,292
Come on.
Gimme a break.
What about that?

415
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:17,486
He's bluffing.
I can take him myself.

416
00:24:19,163 --> 00:24:21,961
It's okay, Mary.
They was just bluffing us.

417
00:24:27,104 --> 00:24:29,038
It's happening.

418
00:24:29,106 --> 00:24:31,700
Oh, Jesus, it's happening.

419
00:24:31,776 --> 00:24:33,710
Oh, Jesus.

420
00:24:34,879 --> 00:24:36,813
Now listen to me, please.

421
00:24:36,881 --> 00:24:40,783
This is your second warning,
O'Neary, unless you already
come to your senses.

422
00:24:40,851 --> 00:24:44,048
I need your help.
We have to have
a doctor now!

423
00:24:44,121 --> 00:24:45,952
Eh, fuck you!
For your head.

424
00:24:46,023 --> 00:24:50,517
A doctor, for Christ's sake.
She's having the baby!

425
00:24:50,594 --> 00:24:52,926
He's bullshittin'.
Why didn't he call
the doctor?

426
00:24:52,997 --> 00:24:56,057
Yeah, bullshit.
Why don't you call
a doctor?

427
00:24:56,133 --> 00:24:58,124
Because you turned
my phone off!

428
00:24:58,202 --> 00:25:01,831
You turned the phone off?
I turned the phone off.

429
00:25:01,906 --> 00:25:04,170
I don't know,
the other day.

430
00:25:04,241 --> 00:25:07,972
I swear to you,
we'll both be outta here,
but we need a doctor now!

431
00:25:08,045 --> 00:25:11,503
I think this is
a little different now.

432
00:25:11,582 --> 00:25:15,245
She's having a baby.
Maybe she is
having a baby.

433
00:25:15,319 --> 00:25:17,787
[All Talking At Once]
[Mary Sobbing]

434
00:25:17,855 --> 00:25:21,382
Okay, look.
Since technically you have
one warning left, O'Neary,

435
00:25:21,459 --> 00:25:25,657
I'm gonna take your word
for it, but don't try
nothin'funny, you hear?

436
00:25:25,729 --> 00:25:27,663
Chip, go call a doctor.
Yeah.

437
00:25:27,731 --> 00:25:29,665
Leave the bat.

438
00:25:29,733 --> 00:25:31,826
Could you imagine
if she had a baby?

439
00:25:34,205 --> 00:25:36,196
What happened?
Is he out?
Where's your phone?

440
00:25:36,273 --> 00:25:38,571
Is the phone in here?
The phone, over here.

441
00:25:38,642 --> 00:25:40,906
Thank you.
Here we go.

442
00:25:40,978 --> 00:25:44,311
So, what's going on?
Nothin'.
Nothin' is goin' on.

443
00:25:44,381 --> 00:25:47,043
Yeah, hello, operator.
We need a doctor over here.

444
00:25:47,117 --> 00:25:49,312
A doctor? Oh, my God.
Chip, somebody got hurt.

445
00:25:49,386 --> 00:25:51,877
Yeah, we're at...
No, it's the woman
upstairs.

446
00:25:51,956 --> 00:25:53,924
She's having a baby
or something.

447
00:25:53,991 --> 00:25:56,983
She's having a baby?
Oh, my God!
Yes, it's, uh...

448
00:25:57,061 --> 00:25:59,188
What, the address?
I think we're at...

449
00:25:59,263 --> 00:26:03,700
Hey, Buddy.
She's having a baby?
That's what he says.

450
00:26:03,767 --> 00:26:06,031
What the hell are you guys
just standing here for?

451
00:26:06,103 --> 00:26:08,469
We're just here makin' sure
he don't try nothin' funny.

452
00:26:08,539 --> 00:26:11,201
You're a bunch of knuckleheads,
you know that?

453
00:26:18,482 --> 00:26:20,712
Hello?

454
00:26:20,784 --> 00:26:22,718
Hello!

455
00:26:22,786 --> 00:26:24,720
They're here!
[Sobbing]

456
00:26:24,788 --> 00:26:27,552
God, she's having it.
Oh, my God!

457
00:26:27,625 --> 00:26:29,991
Hey, listen,
it's gonna be okay.
I'll help you.

458
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:31,994
It hurts!

459
00:26:32,062 --> 00:26:34,553
[Mumbling]

460
00:26:34,632 --> 00:26:37,499
Oh, my God. I need you
to get me sheets,
towels, anything.

461
00:26:37,568 --> 00:26:40,469
[Whimpering]
I've never done this before,
but you're gonna be okay.

462
00:26:40,538 --> 00:26:42,165
Hey!

463
00:26:42,239 --> 00:26:44,901
[Mary Groaning]

464
00:26:44,975 --> 00:26:47,466
Maybe I should go
up there, huh?

465
00:26:47,545 --> 00:26:50,173
Yeah, maybe you should.
We'll stay down here.

466
00:26:50,247 --> 00:26:52,647
You know,
in case he tries
something funny.

467
00:26:52,716 --> 00:26:55,810
[Estelle]
Squat, squat, baby.
What's your name, honey?

468
00:26:55,886 --> 00:27:00,186
Mary, I'm gonna help you.
Oh, my God, she's...

469
00:27:00,257 --> 00:27:02,122
I have it, baby.
He's right here.

470
00:27:02,192 --> 00:27:04,752
Just push for me.
Come on.
[Straining]

471
00:27:04,828 --> 00:27:09,322
[Estelle Yelling,
Indistinct]

472
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,163
[Mary Yelling]

473
00:27:11,235 --> 00:27:13,499
I need you to push
one more time, please!

474
00:27:13,571 --> 00:27:16,665
You gotta push.
I know it hurts.
I know it hurts.

475
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:20,699
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

476
00:27:22,446 --> 00:27:25,381
[Estelle Crying]
[Baby Crying]

477
00:27:32,423 --> 00:27:34,414
[Narrator] That's me,
[Buddy]
He's something, isn't he?

478
00:27:34,491 --> 00:27:38,518
In the kitchen of the home
in which I was born.

479
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:43,322
Are you ready
to meet Daddy?
[Jim Laughs]

480
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:46,961
I guess he's
a little dirty, I guess.

481
00:27:47,037 --> 00:27:52,600
He's not dirty.
Just... Just looks
colored sometimes.

482
00:27:52,676 --> 00:27:54,871
[Narrator]
You may detect
vaguely quizzical looks...

483
00:27:54,945 --> 00:27:57,106
on the faces of those
who were present.

484
00:28:01,318 --> 00:28:04,310
That's because it was
immediately apparent that,

485
00:28:04,388 --> 00:28:07,949
in spite of having been born
of two white parents,

486
00:28:08,025 --> 00:28:11,051
I seemed to have been made
of darker material.

487
00:28:12,229 --> 00:28:14,959
Hey, it's a her.

488
00:28:22,473 --> 00:28:25,408
Bring him to me.

489
00:28:29,433 --> 00:28:32,459
Bring him to me!

490
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:54,283
- What happened?
- Hey, uh, look.

491
00:28:54,357 --> 00:28:57,724
Go back to the bar, okay?
I'll meet you there later.

492
00:29:00,564 --> 00:29:04,159
That was the last time
anyone in Staten Island
ever saw Jim O'Neary,

493
00:29:04,234 --> 00:29:07,135
my mother's husband.

494
00:29:07,204 --> 00:29:09,900
He was arrested for vagrancy
several days later...

495
00:29:09,973 --> 00:29:13,306
and vanished for good
shortly thereafter.

496
00:29:20,417 --> 00:29:23,215
My mother recovered
from my birth in a short time.

497
00:29:23,286 --> 00:29:26,687
And later told me that
the only shocking thing
about the color of my skin...

498
00:29:26,757 --> 00:29:29,021
was that the inevitable
hadn't occurred to her...

499
00:29:29,092 --> 00:29:31,424
during the eight
and a half months
of her pregnancy,

500
00:29:31,495 --> 00:29:34,020
at least not consciously.

501
00:29:34,097 --> 00:29:37,828
The brief and apparently
satisfactory reunion she had
with my natural father...

502
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:41,393
had never entered her mind
as a possible complication.

503
00:29:41,471 --> 00:29:45,168
But perhaps it constituted
a sort of backup plan.

504
00:29:45,242 --> 00:29:49,702
Her life with her first husband
was, one way or another, in need
of of some drastic change.

505
00:29:52,783 --> 00:29:56,184
[Buddy]
It's got the nose,
the skin, everything.

506
00:29:56,253 --> 00:29:59,711
The kid... The kid's
fuckin'colored?
Half, yeah.

507
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:02,520
You gotta be kiddin' me.

508
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:04,526
Danny, I swear to Christ.

509
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:06,528
You mean she really
fucked some coon?

510
00:30:06,596 --> 00:30:08,530
Evidently. How else
does it happen, right?

511
00:30:11,501 --> 00:30:13,594
Well, Buddy,
look at it this way.

512
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:16,503
In a few years, you're
going to have your own
janitor on the premise.

513
00:30:16,573 --> 00:30:18,507
[All Chuckle]

514
00:30:18,575 --> 00:30:22,909
Kinda puts a black spot
on the neighborhood, you know.

515
00:30:22,979 --> 00:30:24,571
[All Laughing]

516
00:30:24,648 --> 00:30:27,879
Kinda gives a new meaning
to the term "black Irish,"
you know what I mean?

517
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:31,318
Let's have a couple
of drinks here
on the spook.

518
00:30:31,388 --> 00:30:33,788
To his own house.
To your own house,
huh?

519
00:30:33,857 --> 00:30:35,791
You gonna stay
in the house now?

520
00:30:35,859 --> 00:30:38,453
Yeah. Why not?
I ran him... Sure.

521
00:30:38,528 --> 00:30:42,396
## [Jazz]

522
00:30:56,146 --> 00:30:59,377
## [Jazz Continues]

523
00:31:21,504 --> 00:31:23,438
Buddy.

524
00:31:23,506 --> 00:31:25,440
Buddy.

525
00:31:28,144 --> 00:31:31,705
Estelle told me what happened.
What are you gonna do
about it?

526
00:31:31,781 --> 00:31:34,215
About what?

527
00:31:34,284 --> 00:31:37,253
He's drunk, Ma.
He doesn't even realize
what's going on.

528
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:41,120
Come on, I'm fine.
I ain't drunk, all right?
What? What?

529
00:31:41,191 --> 00:31:43,716
You know, you think
you're so smart, huh?

530
00:31:43,793 --> 00:31:47,058
Big-shot homeowner.
You're gonna run
your own business.

531
00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:49,655
But yet, you're
too stupid to realize...

532
00:31:49,733 --> 00:31:52,964
when something
very, very important
has happened here.

533
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:55,300
- What?
- Buddy.

534
00:31:56,973 --> 00:32:01,410
- The baby is colored.
- Yeah, so?
It ain't ours.

535
00:32:01,478 --> 00:32:04,106
But it happened
under our roof.

536
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:07,672
Buddy, this thing
and her baby
are still here.

537
00:32:07,751 --> 00:32:12,279
We gotta get her out,
and we gotta get
her out now!

538
00:32:12,355 --> 00:32:14,823
Honey, look.
She just had the kid,
all right?

539
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:17,587
Give her a couple
of days, okay?
I'll talk to her.

540
00:32:17,661 --> 00:32:19,891
No.
No, Buddy, tomorrow.

541
00:32:19,963 --> 00:32:22,523
Or you know
where I'll be.

542
00:32:22,599 --> 00:32:24,533
That's it, okay?

543
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:36,272
[Knocking]
It's Visalo.

544
00:32:36,346 --> 00:32:38,280
Come in.
[Baby Crying]

545
00:32:46,356 --> 00:32:48,620
[Fussing]

546
00:32:48,692 --> 00:32:50,626
Ever seen one before?

547
00:32:50,694 --> 00:32:53,219
Sorry.
[Clears Throat]

548
00:32:53,296 --> 00:32:56,561
I, uh,
I came to tell you...
You came to tell me...

549
00:32:56,633 --> 00:32:59,568
that my husband is back,
quit the drink,

550
00:32:59,636 --> 00:33:01,797
paid you the back rent
and all is forgiven.

551
00:33:03,073 --> 00:33:06,531
I think you know what
I came up here to tell you.

552
00:33:08,011 --> 00:33:10,707
All I ask you for
is a week.

553
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:14,341
Just a week to rest
and make some kind
of arrangements.

554
00:33:14,417 --> 00:33:16,351
A week?

555
00:33:16,419 --> 00:33:20,014
I've got a sister
in Sheepshead Bay.
She'll help.

556
00:33:20,090 --> 00:33:23,491
We haven't spoken for a while,
but I'm sure she'll help.

557
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,619
I think you oughta know,
l-l-l...

558
00:33:25,695 --> 00:33:30,064
If it's the money,
I'll pay you for it
as soon as I can.

559
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:32,863
Just a week.
That's all I ask you.

560
00:33:35,038 --> 00:33:37,700
It's gotta be tomorrow.

561
00:33:37,774 --> 00:33:39,708
Well,

562
00:33:39,776 --> 00:33:43,268
I couldn't expect you to let me
stay here rent-free,

563
00:33:43,346 --> 00:33:47,442
to look after a child
that nobody in the world could
possibly want now, could I?

564
00:33:47,517 --> 00:33:51,578
You gotta admit, I mean,
it's a little odd, right?

565
00:33:53,289 --> 00:33:55,723
Well, so what?

566
00:33:55,792 --> 00:33:58,920
I'm not asking
for your pity.
I don't care...

567
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:00,929
what you
or anyone else thinks.

568
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:03,727
I got nothing
to be ashamed of.

569
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:08,533
I'll do you the courtesy
of getting out of your house
tomorrow.

570
00:34:12,208 --> 00:34:15,371
Hey, no hard feelings,
right?

571
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:19,314
God help you.

572
00:34:21,985 --> 00:34:23,919
What's with
the green paint?

573
00:34:23,987 --> 00:34:25,921
It's left over
from the, uh, you know.

574
00:34:25,989 --> 00:34:27,923
The house painting
service.

575
00:34:27,991 --> 00:34:30,221
Figured I could use it
on the trim inside.

576
00:34:30,293 --> 00:34:32,227
I don't see a bar
being done in green,

577
00:34:32,295 --> 00:34:35,628
- unless it's got
an Irish theme.
- Bite your fuckin' tongue.

578
00:34:38,301 --> 00:34:41,737
[Baby Crying]
Morning.

579
00:34:41,805 --> 00:34:43,739
Morning.

580
00:34:46,743 --> 00:34:49,735
Girl like that,
fuckin' a molignard.
What a shame.

581
00:34:49,813 --> 00:34:51,906
[Baby Crying]

582
00:34:55,552 --> 00:34:58,350
I've left all the furniture.
Sell it if you wish.

583
00:34:58,421 --> 00:35:00,787
Unless you want it.

584
00:35:00,857 --> 00:35:04,088
What would I need
with it?

585
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:07,323
Here. Take this stuff
inside, will ya?

586
00:35:07,397 --> 00:35:11,026
I'll be back in a sec.
All right.

587
00:35:11,101 --> 00:35:13,831
Forget the key.
Just kick it.
Just kick it.

588
00:35:19,609 --> 00:35:21,543
Hey.

589
00:35:22,612 --> 00:35:24,546
Do you know
where you're going?

590
00:35:24,614 --> 00:35:27,674
What does it matter
to you?

591
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:30,116
I'm just askin'.

592
00:35:30,186 --> 00:35:33,212
Well, if you must know,
I'm checking into
the Doyleton Hotel,

593
00:35:33,289 --> 00:35:35,450
until my sister
can arrange something.

594
00:35:35,525 --> 00:35:37,459
The Doyleton?

595
00:35:37,527 --> 00:35:39,461
Jesus,
you gotta be careful.

596
00:35:39,529 --> 00:35:42,828
I mean, that's mostly...

597
00:35:42,899 --> 00:35:44,890
ladies of the evening.

598
00:35:46,136 --> 00:35:48,331
I beg your pardon?
You know, hookers.

599
00:35:48,404 --> 00:35:51,532
Prostitutes.
That kind of thing.

600
00:35:51,608 --> 00:35:54,270
[Baby Crying]

601
00:35:54,344 --> 00:35:57,211
I wasn't expecting
the Waldorf.

602
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,214
May I go now?

603
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:01,307
Look, I'm just
tryin' to be...
Helpful?

604
00:36:01,384 --> 00:36:04,080
As always, Mr. Visalo.

605
00:36:07,724 --> 00:36:09,658
You crazy bitch.

606
00:36:15,451 --> 00:36:17,544
[Narrator]
On weekends, everybody
did what they could...

607
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:20,350
to help Buddy and Estelle
make something of their home.

608
00:36:20,422 --> 00:36:25,724
[Chattering]

609
00:36:25,795 --> 00:36:28,059
We're gonna take this down.

610
00:36:41,644 --> 00:36:44,579
Huh? Beautiful.

611
00:36:44,647 --> 00:36:47,138
That is glass.
I betcha that's an antique.

612
00:36:47,216 --> 00:36:49,650
Hey, honey,
take a look at this.

613
00:36:49,718 --> 00:36:53,711
It's nice, Estelle.
Honey!

614
00:36:53,789 --> 00:36:55,723
Gorgeous. Beautiful.

615
00:36:55,791 --> 00:36:58,385
Wow, this thing's
like a church.

616
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:01,190
[Narrator]
During the weeks,
the grinding daily routine...

617
00:37:01,263 --> 00:37:03,128
went on for both the men...

618
00:37:03,199 --> 00:37:05,326
Hey, thanks,
you know?

619
00:37:05,401 --> 00:37:07,528
For what?
For encouraging me.

620
00:37:07,603 --> 00:37:10,163
You're the only one
I know who does.

621
00:37:10,239 --> 00:37:12,207
That's 'cause
you got balls.

622
00:37:12,274 --> 00:37:15,175
[Narrator]
As well as for the women.
Should I go down the list?

623
00:37:15,244 --> 00:37:19,044
The pizza business.
The painting business.
The limo business.

624
00:37:19,114 --> 00:37:21,207
They were
pretty good ideas.
Give me a break.

625
00:37:21,283 --> 00:37:25,413
Gradually, the odd set of events
surrounding my birth disappeared
into the haze of folklore.

626
00:37:25,487 --> 00:37:28,786
You know what else she said?
She said you should have
told the police.

627
00:37:28,858 --> 00:37:32,521
'Cause what she did
is against the law.

628
00:37:32,595 --> 00:37:34,529
What is?

629
00:37:34,597 --> 00:37:37,191
"Myseginantin."
Or something.

630
00:37:37,266 --> 00:37:40,030
It's that imbalance
that the Irish got.

631
00:37:40,102 --> 00:37:42,036
And the mick says,
"Just havin' a baby.

632
00:37:42,104 --> 00:37:44,095
Just havin' a baby."
Baby.

633
00:37:44,173 --> 00:37:47,074
How much longer do I gotta
hear this story, huh, Ange?

634
00:37:47,142 --> 00:37:49,940
Buddy, you don't know,
but you made history.

635
00:37:50,012 --> 00:37:52,537
What happened at your house,
it ain't never gonna be
forgotten.

636
00:37:52,615 --> 00:37:54,549
What the hell?
It wasn't my fault.

637
00:37:54,617 --> 00:37:58,280
Nobody said it was.
Come on.
Have another drink.

638
00:37:58,354 --> 00:38:00,481
So, Buddy comes back
downstairs, right?

639
00:38:00,556 --> 00:38:02,820
And I go,
"So what was it,
boy or a girl?"

640
00:38:02,892 --> 00:38:05,383
And he says,
"Neither, pickaninny.

641
00:38:05,461 --> 00:38:07,395
[All Laughing]

642
00:38:07,463 --> 00:38:09,397
I never said that.

643
00:38:17,773 --> 00:38:22,437
[Man]
# For the road that
we've been travelin'on #

644
00:38:22,511 --> 00:38:26,072
# Is oh, so rough #

645
00:38:26,148 --> 00:38:29,311
# That piece that you've
been settin'is gettin'#

646
00:38:29,385 --> 00:38:32,980
# Oh, so tough #

00:38:33,055 --> 00:38:35,285
# To say we could continue #

648
00:38:35,357 --> 00:38:39,418
# Would be such a bluff #

649
00:38:39,495 --> 00:38:42,157
# So have another one #

650
00:38:42,231 --> 00:38:44,995
# On me ##

651
00:38:48,103 --> 00:38:50,037
Uh, I'm lookin'
for somebody.

652
00:38:50,105 --> 00:38:52,039
Her name's O'Neary.
Mary.

653
00:38:52,107 --> 00:38:54,041
Fourth floor.

654
00:38:54,109 --> 00:38:58,239
Fourth floor.
Uh, which room?

655
00:38:58,314 --> 00:39:00,282
How the fuck
should I know?

656
00:39:21,737 --> 00:39:23,671
[Mary]
Who is it?

657
00:39:23,739 --> 00:39:25,673
It's Visalo.

658
00:39:25,741 --> 00:39:28,972
I was just passin' by,
and I was wonderin'

won't take me in.

the whole thing
to her husband.

Well, maybe you
oughta consider, uh,
giving it away.

Why are you here?

665
00:39:54,069 --> 00:39:56,196
I don't know.

666
00:39:56,271 --> 00:39:59,729
I don't know. You know,
they were talking about you
down at the bar. I mean...

667
00:39:59,808 --> 00:40:04,370
I wasn't saying anything,
but I just started wondering
how you were doing.

668
00:40:04,446 --> 00:40:07,347
I give you something
to talk about, do I?

669

You and your friends
at the bar.

at the market too.

and then the next thing
you're around here,

672

and givin' me advice.

give him away?

674
00:40:21,563 --> 00:40:24,031
Because maybe
I don't want to.

675
00:40:24,099 --> 00:40:27,899
- I'm just trying to help.
- You don't care.

And my name is not Mary.
It's Mrs. O'Neary to you.

679
00:40:39,681 --> 00:40:43,242
I'd never dream of calling you
by your first name,
Mr. Visalo.

680
00:40:47,489 --> 00:40:51,323
It's Mrs. O'Neary.
Where's Mr. O'Neary, huh?

an undisputed fact...

No, you can't.

I'm not doing it

I don't need your pity.

[Narrator]
A letter from
the Staten Island Bank...

728
00:43:35,657 --> 00:43:39,093
was addressed to Mr. Visalo
and urged his immediate
attention.

729
00:43:39,161 --> 00:43:43,063
Though, it was his wife
who decided to take matters
into her own hands.

730
00:43:50,839 --> 00:43:53,740
According to
my calculations, you, uh,

731
00:43:53,809 --> 00:43:58,337
your expenditures are running
about two and a half times
your income.

732
00:43:58,413 --> 00:44:01,576
But there's no law against
how much of our own money
we spend, is there?

733
00:44:01,650 --> 00:44:02,765
Certainly not.
As long as the collateral
remains intact.

734
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:04,960
Certainly not.
As long as the collateral
remains intact.

735
00:44:05,034 --> 00:44:08,197
This was merely
a courtesy on our part
to protect you.

736
00:44:08,271 --> 00:44:10,831
However, if the rate
of spending continues,

737
00:44:10,907 --> 00:44:16,038
you have only perhaps...
a month and a half
before your savings run out.

738
00:44:16,112 --> 00:44:19,104
And then,
we will have to talk.

739
00:44:19,182 --> 00:44:21,616
That won't be necessary.
And could you do us a favor...

740
00:44:21,684 --> 00:44:24,118
and not send any more
of these letters?

741
00:44:24,187 --> 00:44:28,521
My husband,
he works very hard.
He's under a lot of pressure.

742
00:44:28,591 --> 00:44:30,582
He don't need
this aggravation.

743
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:32,753

has he got a name?

so there was no need for a name.

01:00:39,246 --> 01:00:43,683
# On their way #

990
01:00:43,750 --> 01:00:47,516
# For me... #
[Narrator]
They say that memories
before the age of three...

991
01:00:47,587 --> 01:00:50,420
are highly selective
and not to be trusted.

992
01:00:50,490 --> 01:00:52,651
But my memory
of that long-forgotten
Saturday afternoon...

993
01:00:52,726 --> 01:00:55,160
is strangely fresh
and exacting.

994
01:00:55,228 --> 01:00:59,688
# Winter will so lightly #

995
01:00:59,766 --> 01:01:03,099
# Spread its cloak of white #

996
01:01:03,169 --> 01:01:07,865
# But nightly
I won't sleep a wink #

997
01:01:07,999 --> 01:01:14,495
# For if I do #

998
01:01:14,572 --> 01:01:17,040
# Dreams of you #

999
01:01:17,108 --> 01:01:23,377
# Will make me lonely too #

1000
01:01:23,447 --> 01:01:28,214
# And when blue skies #

1001
01:01:28,286 --> 01:01:34,156
# Turn steel gray #

1002
01:01:34,225 --> 01:01:39,219
# And autumn whispers #

1003
01:01:39,297 --> 01:01:42,926
# On its way #

1004
01:01:45,269 --> 01:01:48,898
# Golden harvests #

1005
01:01:48,973 --> 01:01:54,172
# On their way #

1006
01:01:54,245 --> 01:01:56,736
# For me #

1007
01:01:56,814 --> 01:02:02,218
# Won't have
a thing to say #

1008
01:02:04,989 --> 01:02:09,858
# Winter will so lightly #

1009
01:02:09,927 --> 01:02:15,763
# Spread its cloak of white
But nightly #

1010
01:02:15,833 --> 01:02:18,199
# I won't sleep a wink #

1011
01:02:18,269 --> 01:02:24,572
# For if I do #

1012
01:02:24,642 --> 01:02:27,042
# Dreams of you #

1013
01:02:27,111 --> 01:02:29,671
# Will make me lonely #

1014
01:02:29,747 --> 01:02:34,912
# Too ##

1015
01:02:42,827 --> 01:02:46,263
Mr. Visalo...
What?

1016
01:02:46,330 --> 01:02:50,061
I just want you to know...

1017
01:02:50,134 --> 01:02:53,365
I didn't kiss you
'cause I expect anything.

1018
01:02:57,708 --> 01:02:59,642
Yeah, well,

1019
01:02:59,710 --> 01:03:02,577
it takes two
to tango, huh?

1020
01:03:08,953 --> 01:03:11,979
It's gettin'
dark out, huh?

1021
01:03:12,056 --> 01:03:15,753
It must be late.

1022
01:03:15,826 --> 01:03:17,919
Nino's at 6:00.
Jesus!

1023
01:03:33,077 --> 01:03:35,978
Hey, Mary!

1024
01:03:48,159 --> 01:03:50,027
## [Opera]

1025
01:03:50,027 --> 01:03:51,517
## [Opera]

1026
01:03:51,595 --> 01:03:55,929
- Yeah, uh, Visalo.
...at least 300 pounds.

1027
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,400
You almost
got killed over that.
Four hundred.

1028
01:03:58,469 --> 01:04:00,733
[Cackling Laugh]
Excuse me. I'm gonna
go to the men's room.

1029
01:04:00,805 --> 01:04:03,399
I mean, I think
I thought I looked bad.

1030
01:04:03,474 --> 01:04:05,533
[Whispering,
Indistinct]
Buddy. Come...

1031
01:04:05,609 --> 01:04:08,772
What?
Where the fuck
you been?

1032
01:04:08,846 --> 01:04:11,178
How long does
it take to get nails?
Hey, I was...

1033
01:04:11,248 --> 01:04:13,876
Oh, you been
drinkin'?
I'm fuckin'
tanked, man.

1034
01:04:13,951 --> 01:04:16,442
I was at Angelo's
all afternoon waiting for you.
No kiddin', huh?

1035
01:04:16,520 --> 01:04:19,978
You been eating
somethin'?
What?
Oh, just a snack.

1036
01:04:20,057 --> 01:04:22,025
Look,
where are the girls?
They're in the back.

1037
01:04:22,092 --> 01:04:24,560
Come on.
Jesus.
Come on.

1038
01:04:24,628 --> 01:04:27,188
H-Hey. Hey.
Look what blew in.

1039
01:04:27,264 --> 01:04:29,892
Sorry I'm late,
there.
Hello.

1040
01:04:29,967 --> 01:04:32,697
Hello. Hey.

1041
01:04:32,770 --> 01:04:35,170
All right.
I ordered you
the galaman.

1042
01:04:35,239 --> 01:04:37,707
I know how much
you love that.
Oh, yeah.

1043
01:04:37,775 --> 01:04:40,573
Oh, wait until you guys
see all the goodies that
we got for you.

1044
01:04:40,644 --> 01:04:43,010
Half-off on the all socks,
the underwear...

1045
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:45,378
Underwear?
Lucky me, huh?
Yeah, lucky you.

1046
01:04:45,449 --> 01:04:48,782
Wait'll you see
the flannel jackets we got.
Flannel jackets?

1047
01:04:48,853 --> 01:04:52,016
## [Continues]
Oh, nice. Nice.

1048
01:04:54,725 --> 01:04:56,955
Who's that?

1049
01:04:57,027 --> 01:04:59,257
Works at the bank.

1050
01:04:59,330 --> 01:05:02,299
Yeah?
What are you doin'
goin'to the bank?

1051
01:05:02,366 --> 01:05:04,391
Why can't I go
to the bank?

1052
01:05:04,468 --> 01:05:07,028
Well, you got no reason
to go to the bank.
You don't get a paycheck.

1053
01:05:07,104 --> 01:05:09,231
Hey,
cin d'ante, eh?
Salud.

1054
01:05:09,306 --> 01:05:11,797
I wouldn't want
to intrude.

1055
01:05:13,511 --> 01:05:16,139
Mr. Brancaccio,
this is my husband, Buddy.
How are you?

1056
01:05:17,915 --> 01:05:20,941
I just wanted
to apologize again.

1057
01:05:21,018 --> 01:05:25,421
Don't mention it.
W-W-Wait.
What are you talking about?

1058
01:05:25,489 --> 01:05:28,822
- Nothin', honey. Thank you.
- No. No. You were right,
Mrs. Visalo.

1059
01:05:28,893 --> 01:05:32,124
There's no law
against the amount
of money people spend,

1060
01:05:32,196 --> 01:05:34,255
and it's really none
of our business.

1061
01:05:34,331 --> 01:05:36,731
Look,
we're eatin' here, okay?

1062
01:05:45,276 --> 01:05:47,301
Now, what the hell,
huh, Estelle?

1063
01:05:47,378 --> 01:05:50,142
I'll tell
you later.
No. No.
You tell me now.

1064
01:05:50,214 --> 01:05:53,911
[Sighs]
They sent a letter
to the bank.

1065
01:05:53,984 --> 01:05:56,214
They said we were
overspendin' or somethin'.
I don't know.

1066
01:05:56,287 --> 01:05:59,688
So I was passin' by,
and went in and told them
to mind their own business.

1067
01:05:59,757 --> 01:06:03,659
Okay?
The bank sent
you a letter?

1068
01:06:03,727 --> 01:06:06,389
To you.
I opened it by mistake.

1069
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:09,091
Why didn't you tell me?
I didn't want you to worry.

1070
01:06:13,904 --> 01:06:15,963
Excuse me.
Uh, come here, will you?

1071
01:06:16,040 --> 01:06:18,031
[Groans]

1072
01:06:21,011 --> 01:06:24,139
Eh, tell me
what's goin' on.
Buddy,
what is the big deal?

1073
01:06:24,214 --> 01:06:26,375
Wh... It's none
of his business!
Let him talk.

1074
01:06:26,450 --> 01:06:28,714
All right?
What's with
this letter stuff?

1075
01:06:28,786 --> 01:06:32,222
I only wanted to help.
Our letter upset your wife.

1076
01:06:32,289 --> 01:06:35,588
We try to keep an eye
on our first-time homeowners.

1077
01:06:35,659 --> 01:06:39,288
- So, what's the problem?
- Nothing. Our spending
is outdoing our savings.

1078
01:06:39,363 --> 01:06:42,059
I believe it was
by two and a half times.

1079
01:06:42,132 --> 01:06:44,566
[Whistles]
Wow.

1080
01:06:44,635 --> 01:06:46,569
No, no, no, no.
That not okay, okay?

1081
01:06:46,637 --> 01:06:49,470
Why don't you
tell me that?
Just eat the dinner,

1082
01:06:49,540 --> 01:06:51,565
and we'll talk about it
later, okay?

1083
01:06:51,642 --> 01:06:55,043
Listen, I got a right to know.
After all, I'm a homeowner!
Oh, here we go.

1084
01:06:55,112 --> 01:06:58,138
The big-shot homeowner.
Okay, so what did
she say to you?

1085
01:06:58,215 --> 01:07:00,240
Nothin'! I told him that
he should mind his business,

1086
01:07:00,317 --> 01:07:02,342
that you know
what you're doin' and that
he shouldn't worry, okay?

1087
01:07:02,419 --> 01:07:04,853
Yeah, yeah. Damn right.
It's none of your business.

1088
01:07:04,922 --> 01:07:08,585
- I know what I'm doin'!
- My apologies again.

1089
01:07:08,659 --> 01:07:12,095
- All right.
- Calm down.

1090
01:07:12,162 --> 01:07:14,756
## [Continues]

1091
01:07:14,832 --> 01:07:18,199
It's good.
Can I have the cheese?

1092
01:07:22,206 --> 01:07:26,267
Two and a half times!
How come you don't tell me
somethin' like that?

1093
01:07:26,343 --> 01:07:29,244
Because you're
the big-shot homeowner.
You ought to know.

1094
01:07:29,313 --> 01:07:32,214
And you know what?
If you don't,
it serves you right.

1095
01:07:32,282 --> 01:07:35,149
You don't know nothin'
about ownin' a house
or runnin' some bar.

1096
01:07:35,219 --> 01:07:38,950
You don't just do things
because you feel like it.

1097
01:07:39,023 --> 01:07:41,423
You got to have
the brains for it.
Oh. Oh, okay.

1098
01:07:41,492 --> 01:07:43,426
So, you sayin'
I don't got no brains?

1099
01:07:43,494 --> 01:07:46,463
I don't have any brains,
she says.
I was just trying
to look out for you.

1100
01:07:46,530 --> 01:07:48,521
All I'm saying...
I was trying
to help you.

1101
01:07:48,599 --> 01:07:51,432
I bought a house, right?
That's got to take some brains.

1102
01:07:51,502 --> 01:07:54,562
[Narrator]
The argument
was legendary, epic.

1103
01:07:54,638 --> 01:07:56,606
I'm stupid
and I'm embarrassing.
I'm ignoring you. I'm eating.

1104
01:07:56,674 --> 01:08:00,474
I'm ignoring you.
Watch this.
Mmm, mmm, mmm...

1105
01:08:00,544 --> 01:08:03,172
I did that for us!
What do you mean
you did it for us?

1106
01:08:03,247 --> 01:08:08,014
We're broke and
you don't tell me?
I didn't
want to see you fail again.

1107
01:08:08,085 --> 01:08:10,019
[Narrator]
It went on far into the night,

1108
01:08:10,087 --> 01:08:13,079
Fail?
Encompassing every aspect
of the 11-year union...

1109
01:08:13,157 --> 01:08:15,091
between Buddy
and Estelle Visalo.

1110
01:08:15,159 --> 01:08:18,322
This is not our house.
Why are you making us do this?

1111
01:08:18,395 --> 01:08:22,058
- Wasn't everything okay?
- Don't you want
to better yourself?

1112
01:08:22,132 --> 01:08:26,034
- Don't you want to do
something with your life?
- Like what, Buddy?

1113
01:08:26,103 --> 01:08:28,367
Servin' drinks
to a lot of bums, huh?

1114
01:08:28,439 --> 01:08:31,772
You want to turn me
into a barmaid?
Is that what you want to do?

1115
01:08:31,842 --> 01:08:35,471
Jesus, Estelle.
We own our own business!

1116
01:08:35,546 --> 01:08:38,515
We own our own home!
I mean, Jesus, Estelle!

1117
01:08:38,582 --> 01:08:42,313
This is a America!
Where are you livin'?
This is the point!

1118
01:08:42,386 --> 01:08:44,650
Most women,
they want their husbands
to go up in the world.

1119
01:08:44,722 --> 01:08:47,088
You, you'd be happy
if we stayed back in...

1120
01:08:47,157 --> 01:08:50,285
Back where we belong, Buddy!
Not makin' fools of ourselves.

1121
01:08:50,360 --> 01:08:54,854
Not having everybody
laugh behind our backs.
By who? Who?

1122
01:08:54,932 --> 01:08:57,628
Your stupid friends?
My stupid friends?

1123
01:08:57,701 --> 01:08:59,669
Who the fuck cares, huh?

1124
01:08:59,737 --> 01:09:03,195
I got somethin'
they ain't got. It's a crime
not to use what I got.

1125
01:09:03,273 --> 01:09:06,731
What do you think you got
that's worth throwin' away
our futures on?

1126
01:09:06,810 --> 01:09:10,371
I got talent!
I could be somebody, baby!

1127
01:09:10,447 --> 01:09:12,779
I could run my own life
instead of havin' to answer...

1128
01:09:14,118 --> 01:09:16,814
to some creep bastard
who's got a sign that says
"supervisor" on his desk.

1129
01:09:16,887 --> 01:09:19,947
Buddy, your ideas,
they don't work.

1130
01:09:20,023 --> 01:09:22,116
They haven't yet...

1131
01:09:24,428 --> 01:09:26,362
but this time
they will.

1132
01:09:26,430 --> 01:09:29,756
Why should they?
They never did before.

1133
01:09:31,158 --> 01:09:34,616
Because I'm gonna
make it work,
no matter what!

1134
01:09:34,761 --> 01:09:39,562
"No matter what,"meant Buddy
needed more money to spend
at this present rate.

1135
01:09:39,633 --> 01:09:43,364
So, it's just not possible
on the wage that you earn...

1136
01:09:43,436 --> 01:09:45,597
to make
these expenditures.

1137
01:09:45,672 --> 01:09:48,106
But it's just till
the bar's set up.
Once it's open,

1138
01:09:48,175 --> 01:09:51,872
I'll be in the dough.
Like with the pizza store?

1139
01:09:51,945 --> 01:09:55,403
At this rate,
it doesn't look like
you'll have enough to finish.

1140
01:09:55,482 --> 01:09:58,781
Buddy, he's right.
Why don't we just
rent out the downstairs?

1141
01:09:58,852 --> 01:10:00,877
The bar's half-built!

1142
01:10:00,954 --> 01:10:04,117
So, then we only have
half a bar to pull out.

1143
01:10:04,191 --> 01:10:06,921
Perhaps you could postpone
construction on the bar.

1144
01:10:10,597 --> 01:10:13,327
Screw it.
I'll work the night shift.

1145
01:10:13,400 --> 01:10:16,426
Well, when are you
gonna sleep?
When the bar's open.

1146
01:10:16,503 --> 01:10:19,563
- We done here?
- [Whistle Blowing]

1147
01:10:19,639 --> 01:10:22,972
[Narrator] And so, as
the working men look forward to
the happiest part of their day,

1148
01:10:23,043 --> 01:10:25,637
a drink at the local bar
with their friends,

1149
01:10:25,712 --> 01:10:29,739
Buddy prepared
to pay the price
for his future independence.

1150
01:10:31,084 --> 01:10:36,351
[Bellowing, Indistinct]

1151
01:10:36,423 --> 01:10:39,119
...and join us
till the sunlight.

1152
01:10:39,192 --> 01:10:42,457
You'll get used to it.
These day shift guys...

1153
01:10:42,529 --> 01:10:46,659
start to look like
suckers waking up at dawn
every morning.

1154
01:10:46,733 --> 01:10:50,260
See, that's the best part,
we get to go to sleep at dawn!

1155
01:10:50,337 --> 01:10:53,636
Dawn, yeah.
The sift descends...

1156
01:10:53,707 --> 01:10:56,232
into the sliding machine.

1157
01:10:56,309 --> 01:10:59,676
Make sure it's a smooth flow,
and then turn it around.

1158
01:10:59,746 --> 01:11:02,180
Then get it up,
and then bring it down again.

1159
01:11:02,249 --> 01:11:05,241
But don't you breathe it,
because if you breathe it...

1160
01:11:05,318 --> 01:11:09,254
it's gonna get in your lungs,
and then we're gonna
have to replace you,

1161
01:11:09,322 --> 01:11:11,347
not to mention the flour
with the goccias in it.

1162
01:11:11,424 --> 01:11:14,689
Okay, give it
the button every minute...

1163
01:11:14,761 --> 01:11:17,195
Sift, set, descend, go!

1164
01:11:17,264 --> 01:11:20,529
Go! Go!
Go! Go! Go!
[Shouting, Indistinct]

1165
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:23,660
You know who's a grumbler?
My brother-in-law, Pete.

1166
01:11:23,737 --> 01:11:28,003
He does not appreciate
a goddamn thing!

1167
01:11:28,074 --> 01:11:30,941
Look around you,
how beautiful
this world is.

1168
01:11:31,011 --> 01:11:33,980
You know, I don't know
the last time I was awake
at 3:30 in the mornin'.

1169
01:11:34,047 --> 01:11:36,038
You know, I don't
remember when I wasn't.

1170
01:11:36,116 --> 01:11:41,019
Hey, how about
a couple, you know,
places that stays open?

1171
01:11:41,087 --> 01:11:44,454
Rain check, huh?
Okay.

1172
01:11:44,524 --> 01:11:47,391
Catch you later.
See you tomorrow.

1173
01:12:17,991 --> 01:12:20,357
Hey, Mary.

1174
01:12:36,810 --> 01:12:39,540
You must be tired.

1175
01:12:39,612 --> 01:12:42,172
Ah, you got to do
what it takes.

1176
01:12:42,248 --> 01:12:46,685
Figure she don't want me
to have my own bar.
That's fine with me.

1177
01:12:46,753 --> 01:12:49,449
She'll get used to it
eventually.

1178
01:12:49,522 --> 01:12:51,956
See, the trouble
with Estelle is...

1179
01:12:52,025 --> 01:12:54,152
she don't like
failure.

1180
01:12:54,227 --> 01:12:56,957
I mean, nobody does,
but with her it's
like a disease.

1181
01:12:57,030 --> 01:13:01,399
L-I don't want to make you
think somethin' bad about her.

1182
01:13:01,468 --> 01:13:03,959
She takes great care
of me and all.

1183
01:13:04,037 --> 01:13:07,234
You don't seem
like the kind of man
that needs taking care of.

1184
01:13:10,910 --> 01:13:14,778
Yeah, well, this one
can't go in the tank
like all the others.

1185
01:13:14,848 --> 01:13:20,150
It won't.
We're all meant
for something particular.

1186
01:13:20,220 --> 01:13:22,450
This is what
you're meant for.

1187
01:13:22,522 --> 01:13:27,118
You think so, huh?
I know so,
Mr. Visalo.

1188
01:13:27,193 --> 01:13:29,457
Mmm.

1189
01:13:30,563 --> 01:13:34,522
I found an adoption agency
for the baby.

1190
01:13:34,601 --> 01:13:37,593
They said they don't mind
what he looks like.

1191
01:13:39,439 --> 01:13:43,466
I guess they just
must be startin' out
or somethin', huh?

1192
01:13:44,844 --> 01:13:48,575
It means I can stay
with my sister.

1193
01:13:48,648 --> 01:13:52,277
When?
A week.

1194
01:13:52,352 --> 01:13:55,185
Maybe with the money
you save on paying for me,

1195
01:13:55,255 --> 01:13:58,713
you won't have
to work so hard.
Yeah, I suppose.

1196
01:13:58,792 --> 01:14:02,592
It means I can try
and start over again
like nothin' ever happened.

1197
01:14:02,662 --> 01:14:05,290
Now, why are
you gonna do that?

1198
01:14:05,365 --> 01:14:08,766
I mean, maybe, you're
never gonna want to tell
what happened, but...

1199
01:14:08,835 --> 01:14:12,737
you can remember it,
just yourself.

1200
01:14:12,806 --> 01:14:16,503
No. I can't.

1201
01:14:18,445 --> 01:14:20,413
Guess it's a little
easier that way, huh?

1202
01:14:22,482 --> 01:14:25,007
A lot easier.

1203
01:14:29,823 --> 01:14:31,882
Well, in that case,

1204
01:14:31,958 --> 01:14:35,189
if you and me were to
spend some time together,

1205
01:14:35,261 --> 01:14:38,128
we would just
forget about it,
anyway, and...

1206
01:14:38,198 --> 01:14:40,564
you know me,
I'd never tell.

1207
01:14:40,633 --> 01:14:43,227
And it would be
a lot easier,

1208
01:14:43,303 --> 01:14:45,771
just like you said.

1209
01:14:47,140 --> 01:14:51,577
Why...
Why do you want me,
Mr. Visalo?

1210
01:14:54,013 --> 01:14:58,473
'Cause I got
a feeling about you
I never felt before...

1211
01:14:58,551 --> 01:15:02,317
not even
with my wife.

1212
01:15:02,388 --> 01:15:04,515
I mean, it's not
that I don't love her,

1213
01:15:04,591 --> 01:15:07,082
even though
she pisses me off
all the time.

1214
01:15:07,160 --> 01:15:11,529
No. It's just
this feelin'.

1215
01:15:11,598 --> 01:15:14,533
I been a good husband
11 years.

1216
01:15:14,601 --> 01:15:18,332
I figure one week...

1217
01:15:18,404 --> 01:15:21,396
won't really matter.

1218
01:15:24,477 --> 01:15:28,345
I been a bad girl
my whole life.

1219
01:15:28,414 --> 01:15:32,942
I don't suppose a week
will matter to me, either.

the night shift for two years.

1246
01:17:30,609 --> 01:17:33,669
Still ain't used to it.
They say that
ain't healthy...

that workin' all night,
sleepin' all day.

1248
01:17:36,515 --> 01:17:39,313
How about sleepin' two hours
and then goin' back to work?

1249

He's gonna kill himself.
I swear to God.

If he don't quit,
I'm gonna make him.

1251
01:17:43,789 --> 01:17:46,758
It's bad for his health.
It was worse
before the unions.

1252
01:17:46,825 --> 01:17:49,692
Then, they made 'em work
6:00 to 6:00.

1253
01:17:49,762 --> 01:17:52,196
My Harry used to get home
just in time for me
to wake up, get dressed...

1254
01:17:52,264 --> 01:17:54,824
and go to work,
back when I had to work.

1255
01:17:54,900 --> 01:17:57,368
I wouldn't let
Chip work those hours.

1256
01:17:57,436 --> 01:18:00,496
Unless he wanted to open up
his own bar, huh?
[Scoffs]

1257
01:18:02,174 --> 01:18:04,768
Well, what happened
after the unions?

Used to be 6:00 to 6:00.
Now, it's 6:00 p.m. To 3:00 a.m.

01:18:09,648 --> 01:18:12,139
That's why
we voted for Impostado.

1260
01:18:12,217 --> 01:18:16,244
He made changes.
Mm-hmm.
That was the first
time I ever voted.

1261
01:18:16,322 --> 01:18:18,790
That's why you voted.
You can't live
with those kind of hours.

She'd never doubted
that her husband was simply...

1263
01:18:26,765 --> 01:18:28,858
not talented enough
to be a singer,

1264
01:18:28,934 --> 01:18:31,164
enterprising enough
to be a businessman...

1265

or intelligent enough to be
anything but a factory worker.
[Door Opening, Closing]

1266
01:18:43,649 --> 01:18:46,277
She also never doubted
his fidelity,

his naive,
blundering honesty.

1268
01:18:52,558 --> 01:18:56,961
How was work?
Murder.

1269
01:19:04,103 --> 01:19:06,128
It had never occurred to her
that there might be...

1270
01:19:06,205 --> 01:19:09,538
the slightest hint
of deception in her husband.

1271
01:19:13,912 --> 01:19:16,506
At one point, she thought of
how disappointing it might be...

1272
01:19:16,582 --> 01:19:18,743
if Buddy were simply to go
to an all-night diner...

1273
01:19:18,817 --> 01:19:21,012
and sit there until 6:00.

1274
01:19:21,086 --> 01:19:23,384
That would indicate that
he simply preferred to be...

1275
01:19:23,455 --> 01:19:25,582
anywhere but with her.

She standin' there
with a bag of groceries...

1304
01:23:46,618 --> 01:23:48,586
like the good little
housewife.

1305
01:23:48,654 --> 01:23:51,987
She was probably
going to cook for him.
I can't believe this.

1306
01:23:52,057 --> 01:23:55,151
You mean the one
with the colored baby?
Yes.

1307
01:23:55,227 --> 01:23:58,492
The one with the colored baby.
He spent the night with her too.

1308
01:23:58,563 --> 01:24:00,531
Oh, it's the worst
I ever heard,

1309
01:24:00,599 --> 01:24:03,067
and my Harry's slept
with a lot of skivatses...

1310
01:24:03,135 --> 01:24:06,002
I don't even know
who he is anymore.
Are you gonna go back?

1311
01:24:06,071 --> 01:24:08,665
I already packed my stuff
and moved back to my mother's.

1312
01:24:08,740 --> 01:24:10,901
Good.
Good.
Good.

1313
01:24:10,976 --> 01:24:13,137
Besides there's
hardly anything left.

1314
01:24:13,211 --> 01:24:16,806
What do you mean?
I got a little crazy,
okay?

1315
01:24:16,882 --> 01:24:20,750
Oh, Jesus, Estelle.
After all that work
that you guys did.

1316
01:24:20,819 --> 01:24:24,880
That's right, after all
that work, so he could go do
the hokey-pokey...

1317
01:24:24,956 --> 01:24:28,050
with some puttana
who would sleep with a...

1318
01:24:28,126 --> 01:24:30,754
nigger
and have a baby!

1319
01:24:30,829 --> 01:24:33,855
[Sniffles]
I mean, am I that
disgusting?

1320
01:24:33,932 --> 01:24:37,993
- [All] No.
- Look. Listen-Listen, men...

1321
01:24:38,070 --> 01:24:40,095
they got no sense
of about this stuff.

1322
01:24:40,172 --> 01:24:43,733
Some of them,
they'll sleep with anything.
I mean it... kids, animals.

1323
01:24:43,809 --> 01:24:46,778
Just as long as
they got someone at home
who don't know about it.

1324
01:24:46,845 --> 01:24:50,303
- It excites them!
- Listen, you guys,
you can't say nothin'.

1325
01:24:50,382 --> 01:24:52,816
Promise me.
Teen law, please.

1326
01:24:52,884 --> 01:24:55,011
Please, you can't nothin'
to nobody.

1327
01:24:55,087 --> 01:24:57,419
I am so embarrassed.

1328
01:25:15,574 --> 01:25:16,720
- You heard, huh?
- Down at the bar, yeah.

1329
01:25:16,720 --> 01:25:19,484
- You heard, huh?
- Down at the bar, yeah.

1330
01:25:22,059 --> 01:25:25,153
How'd they
find out?

1331
01:25:25,229 --> 01:25:27,993
Estelle told the girls.
They told the guys.

1332
01:25:28,065 --> 01:25:30,056
You know,
that's that.

1333
01:25:32,769 --> 01:25:36,034
Fucked up here, huh?

1334
01:25:36,106 --> 01:25:40,099
Just tell me,
you want her back, right?

1335
01:25:40,177 --> 01:25:44,580
Well, hell yeah.
I mean, one time
in 11 years, what's that?

1336
01:25:44,648 --> 01:25:47,481
So, uh, why don't
you give her a call?

1337
01:25:47,551 --> 01:25:49,781
Now.

1338
01:25:49,853 --> 01:25:52,048
Might be
a good time.
You know.

1339
01:25:53,757 --> 01:25:56,726
[Buddy] Yeah, I'm listening.
[Narrator]
Negotiations were underway.

1340
01:25:56,793 --> 01:25:58,852
Estelle wouldn't even
see Buddy until he'd gone...

1341
01:25:58,929 --> 01:26:01,159
until he'd gone to my mother
and renounced her.

1342
01:26:01,231 --> 01:26:05,065
That was the term
that was used...
"renounce."

1343
01:26:05,135 --> 01:26:08,127
Re-Renounce...
What the hell
does that mean?

1344
01:26:08,205 --> 01:26:10,799
Then, she would
agree to see him
but at a neutral location...

1345
01:26:10,874 --> 01:26:13,035
the Skyline Diner.

1346
01:26:15,379 --> 01:26:18,041
Hey, Mary!

1347
01:26:24,588 --> 01:26:27,489
Like a hurricane hit that house,
that's what it looks like.

1348
01:26:29,793 --> 01:26:32,387
Oh, Christ.

1349
01:26:33,463 --> 01:26:38,230
Visalo rides again.
Christ.

1350
01:26:39,770 --> 01:26:44,002
I'll be leavin'
tomorrow, so...

1351
01:26:44,074 --> 01:26:46,941
that should be the end
of your problems, really.

1352
01:26:50,747 --> 01:26:53,614
I'm supposed
to renounce you,

1353
01:26:53,684 --> 01:26:55,845
whatever
that means.

1354
01:26:57,087 --> 01:27:01,888
It means to make like
it never existed.

1355
01:27:03,694 --> 01:27:06,185
Is that
what that means?

1356
01:27:07,764 --> 01:27:09,732
Yeah, well, screw it.

1357
01:27:09,800 --> 01:27:14,464
- I'll say that I did
but I don't.
- [Baby Fussing]

1358
01:27:16,440 --> 01:27:20,900
[Crying]
Kid likes
a good show, huh?

1359
01:27:20,978 --> 01:27:24,004
I suppose.

1360
01:27:29,586 --> 01:27:32,180
Well, uh...

1361
01:27:32,256 --> 01:27:36,488
I guess since I'm not
gonna see you again
I ought to say somethin'.

1362
01:27:36,560 --> 01:27:39,358
You don't have to.

1363
01:27:39,429 --> 01:27:42,660
I know I don't have to.
I want to.

1364
01:27:42,733 --> 01:27:45,668
I have to go back
to my wife.

1365
01:27:50,307 --> 01:27:55,006
Well, anyway,
this is what I'm thinkin'.

1366
01:27:55,078 --> 01:27:58,741
When you had
this situation and all,

1367
01:27:58,815 --> 01:28:01,750
I had just done
the hardest thing
I ever did.

1368
01:28:01,818 --> 01:28:05,652
Nobody believed in me...
nobody.

1369
01:28:05,722 --> 01:28:08,020
'Cept for my buddy Chip,
you know, but, uh,

1370
01:28:08,091 --> 01:28:10,559
what's he got
to lose, right?

1371
01:28:10,627 --> 01:28:14,427
Uh, anyway,

1372
01:28:14,498 --> 01:28:18,127
something about you...
what you did...

1373
01:28:18,201 --> 01:28:21,295
I mean, everybody was talkin'
about it and laughin'in a way.

1374
01:28:21,371 --> 01:28:23,999
But-But
it made me think.

1375
01:28:24,074 --> 01:28:26,907
What the hell?

1376
01:28:26,977 --> 01:28:29,309
What the hell?

1377
01:28:29,379 --> 01:28:31,609
You go on.
You know, things happen.

1378
01:28:31,682 --> 01:28:33,843
As long as think the thing
you did was right for you...

1379
01:28:33,917 --> 01:28:35,851
Mr. Visalo...

1380
01:28:35,919 --> 01:28:39,150
I think you should leave.

1381
01:28:50,300 --> 01:28:54,634
[Door Opens, Closes]

1382
01:29:37,814 --> 01:29:40,942
- Hi, Estelle.
- Hi, Buddy.

1383
01:29:43,553 --> 01:29:47,421
- Why they gotta be here?
- 'Cause I want 'em here.

1384
01:29:47,491 --> 01:29:49,755
All right.
All right.

1385
01:29:55,298 --> 01:29:57,391
Okay.

1386
01:29:57,467 --> 01:30:00,334
[Sighs]
First off, you gotta
believe something, okay?

1387
01:30:00,404 --> 01:30:04,067
This is the first...
It-It-It's the only time
this ever happened.

1388
01:30:04,141 --> 01:30:06,075
I mean,
do you believe me?

1389
01:30:06,143 --> 01:30:08,134
Yeah,
I believe you.
Okay.

1390
01:30:10,080 --> 01:30:12,241
Okay,
now the other thing.

1391
01:30:12,315 --> 01:30:14,306
It was a big mistake.

1392
01:30:14,384 --> 01:30:18,582
Then,
why did you do it?

1393
01:30:18,655 --> 01:30:23,354
I don't know.
L-l-I guess...
Don't guess
with me, Buddy.

1394
01:30:23,427 --> 01:30:26,954
You tell me why you would
do something like this to me.

1395
01:30:27,030 --> 01:30:30,056
I know...

1396
01:30:32,836 --> 01:30:36,533
It had somethin'
to do with us.
With us?

1397
01:30:36,606 --> 01:30:38,767
Yeah, I mean...
You know, you been...

1398
01:30:38,842 --> 01:30:42,437
riding me real hard
about the house, huh?

1399
01:30:42,512 --> 01:30:45,640
Even you got to admit
that, at times,
you make it as though...

1400
01:30:45,715 --> 01:30:48,343
I'm tryin' to ruin
your life, you know?

1401
01:30:48,418 --> 01:30:52,514
So, what are you saying?
You saying it's my fault?

1402
01:30:52,589 --> 01:30:55,217
Huh? Is that
what you're sayin'?

1403
01:30:55,292 --> 01:30:57,226
Are you sayin'
it's my fault?

1404
01:30:57,294 --> 01:30:59,956
No, I didn't
say that, okay?

1405
01:31:00,030 --> 01:31:03,158
I'm just tryin' to figure out
myself why I did it.
Look, Buddy,

1406
01:31:03,233 --> 01:31:05,201
Let me make it
easy for you.

1407
01:31:05,268 --> 01:31:08,795
Okay? You did it
because you were feelin'
like a big shot.

1408
01:31:08,872 --> 01:31:13,138
You did it because you think
you're somebody you're not.

1409
01:31:13,210 --> 01:31:16,543
You did it for the same reason
that you've done every other
crazy thing in your life.

1410
01:31:16,613 --> 01:31:20,242
'Cause you think you're
somebody you're not.

1411
01:31:20,317 --> 01:31:24,344
Look...
you're no Don Juan.

1412
01:31:24,421 --> 01:31:27,481
So, forget the singing,
forget that house
because we're sellin' it...

1413
01:31:27,557 --> 01:31:31,220
and we're goin' back
to my mother's.

1414
01:31:31,294 --> 01:31:35,856
Buddy, I've been doin'
some thinkin' too.

1415
01:31:37,767 --> 01:31:39,701
About what?

1416
01:31:41,037 --> 01:31:45,701
Well, you know,
how I really never
really liked...

1417
01:31:45,775 --> 01:31:49,108
I mean, I liked it okay.
Maybe just not as much...

1418
01:31:49,179 --> 01:31:51,409
as you.

1419
01:31:52,782 --> 01:31:55,774
- What?
- [Sighs]

1420
01:31:57,454 --> 01:31:59,388
Doin' it.

1421
01:32:00,724 --> 01:32:02,624
What are
you talkin' here?

1422
01:32:02,692 --> 01:32:07,129
Look, I've been thinkin'
about what you did.

1423
01:32:07,197 --> 01:32:10,428
Okay? And how men
are different than women.

1424
01:32:10,500 --> 01:32:12,559
You know,
and they have
different needs.

1425
01:32:13,670 --> 01:32:17,629
And that...
[Sighs]

1426
01:32:17,707 --> 01:32:20,733
If you feel...

1427
01:32:20,810 --> 01:32:24,371
that you need
to go out and get it,

1428
01:32:24,447 --> 01:32:26,540
then maybe it's okay.

1429
01:32:28,418 --> 01:32:32,821
I guess.
[Indistinct]

1430
01:32:32,889 --> 01:32:36,825
I mean,
it's not like you're
goin' anywhere, right?

1431
01:32:36,893 --> 01:32:39,589
Wait, wait...

1432
01:32:39,663 --> 01:32:44,293
So, you're not
mad with me...

1433
01:32:44,367 --> 01:32:46,335
about that?

1434
01:32:49,172 --> 01:32:54,269
Look, Buddy,
if you wanted
to go fool around,

1435
01:32:54,344 --> 01:32:57,677
I would've looked
the other way.

1436
01:32:57,747 --> 01:32:59,806
[Sobs]
I would've
did that for you.

1437
01:33:02,352 --> 01:33:07,276
But for you
to fool around
with that puttana...

1438
01:33:07,410 --> 01:33:10,243
that whore,

1439
01:33:10,312 --> 01:33:13,076
that nigger lover.

1440

[Sniffling]

1441
01:33:15,885 --> 01:33:20,982
Look, just try
and have better taste
next time, okay?

1442
01:33:25,327 --> 01:33:30,594
Buddy,
what's wrong?

1443
01:33:33,669 --> 01:33:36,502
Talk to me.

1444
01:33:40,309 --> 01:33:42,641
What?

1445
01:33:42,712 --> 01:33:44,646
Buddy, what?

1446
01:34:24,653 --> 01:34:27,121
[Narrator]
He'd never thought of the people
he'd known all his life...

1447
01:34:27,189 --> 01:34:29,282
as his jailers...

1448
01:34:29,358 --> 01:34:31,724
until that moment.

1449
01:36:00,850 --> 01:36:04,946
He's just perfect.
Thanks.

1450
01:36:05,020 --> 01:36:10,185
I'd really hadn't
planned...
Oh, darling.
Don't explain.

1451
01:36:10,259 --> 01:36:12,955
I mean, we're
not about that.

1452
01:36:13,028 --> 01:36:16,930
I know a couple that
would just adore him.
[Coughs]

1453
01:36:16,999 --> 01:36:21,095
Yes!
They're professors
at some small college,

1454
01:36:21,170 --> 01:36:23,331
and they specified
they wanted a baby
born out of wedlock.

1455
01:36:23,405 --> 01:36:26,238
[Mary]
I was married
when I had him.

1456
01:36:26,308 --> 01:36:29,106
Well, that's
even better.

1457
01:36:29,178 --> 01:36:31,305
You know, we do
this thing once a month...

1458
01:36:31,380 --> 01:36:35,339
called "Women on Women
on Race and Sex"
down at the school.

1459
01:36:35,417 --> 01:36:39,513
You'd fit in
with the group perfect.
[Baby Coos]

1460
01:36:39,588 --> 01:36:42,989
- Mr. Visalo?
- Hey, how are you?

1461
01:36:43,058 --> 01:36:46,118
I was just...
Yeah,
I figured.

1462
01:36:46,195 --> 01:36:48,220
Uh...

1463
01:36:48,297 --> 01:36:51,664
Listen, can l...
Can I talk to you
for a minute?

1464
01:36:51,734 --> 01:36:55,602
Well,
we're almost done.
I mean, now.

1465
01:36:55,671 --> 01:36:57,798
Before.

1466
01:37:00,109 --> 01:37:03,203
Would you excuse me?
Sure.

1467
01:37:07,249 --> 01:37:09,513
Uh, outside.

1468
01:37:13,856 --> 01:37:17,121
My wife and I,
we were trying to make up,

1469
01:37:17,192 --> 01:37:20,059
and all of a sudden
I realized that...

1470
01:37:20,129 --> 01:37:24,065
See, well, I never
really understood her.

1471
01:37:24,133 --> 01:37:28,467
Uh, what she wanted
from me or me from her.

1472
01:37:28,537 --> 01:37:31,301
I don't know,
but, uh...

1473
01:37:31,373 --> 01:37:35,207
- Wasn't her fault.
- I hope everything
worked out.

1474
01:37:36,412 --> 01:37:40,712
Really?
Of course.

1475
01:37:40,783 --> 01:37:44,275
No. Don't say that.

1476
01:37:44,353 --> 01:37:46,913
W-Why would you say that?

1477
01:37:49,024 --> 01:37:52,289
I don't know.

1478
01:37:52,361 --> 01:37:54,886
I just assumed that's
what you wanted me to say.

1479
01:37:57,366 --> 01:37:59,459
I walked out.

1480
01:38:00,536 --> 01:38:03,198
Love of God.
'Cause of you.

1481
01:38:03,272 --> 01:38:06,901
Why?
Because I got
this feelin' about you.

1482
01:38:06,976 --> 01:38:09,843
I don't
think you know...
l-I know it's
a little strange,

1483
01:38:09,912 --> 01:38:12,380
but I think maybe
I'm in love with you.

1484
01:38:13,749 --> 01:38:15,910
You don't know
what you're doin',
Mr. Visalo.

1485
01:38:15,985 --> 01:38:18,044
I know, I don't know
what I'm doin'.

1486
01:38:37,506 --> 01:38:42,136
[Sighs]
I've got to take
care of upstairs.

1487
01:38:42,678 --> 01:38:45,670
The baby.

1488
01:38:45,748 --> 01:38:49,946
Uh, where'd
you find that broad?

1489
01:38:50,019 --> 01:38:52,852
Social services.

1490
01:38:52,921 --> 01:38:54,889
Lose her.

1491
01:39:22,618 --> 01:39:25,451
[Narrator]
She had not expected
to stay in Staten Island.

1492
01:39:25,521 --> 01:39:27,648
And certainly
not in the house
where'd she'd spent...

1493
01:39:27,723 --> 01:39:31,124
several very unhappy years
with her first husband.

1494
01:39:31,193 --> 01:39:34,287
And certainly
not with me.

1495
01:39:36,098 --> 01:39:39,499
And the months of working
all day and rebuilding
Buddy's Tavern at night...

1496
01:39:39,568 --> 01:39:41,968
eventually
came to a close.

1497
01:39:42,037 --> 01:39:45,666
Just in time
for a festive
Christmas opening.

1498
01:39:54,950 --> 01:39:57,578
Look what
the wind blew in.

1499
01:39:57,653 --> 01:40:00,019
How you doin', Ange?

1500
01:40:00,089 --> 01:40:02,717
Pretty good,
you know?

1501
01:40:02,791 --> 01:40:04,782
Where you been?

1502
01:40:06,128 --> 01:40:09,586
Workin' on the bar.

1503
01:40:09,665 --> 01:40:11,826
I'm gonna open next week...
Christmas Eve.

1504
01:40:11,900 --> 01:40:14,892
Oh, no shit, huh?

1505
01:40:14,970 --> 01:40:17,803
Quite a showman, Buddy.
You do things in a big way.

1506
01:40:24,613 --> 01:40:27,207
I was thinkin' maybe
you guys want to come down.

1507
01:40:27,282 --> 01:40:31,184
You know, uh, see the place.
I'm gonna sing.
Mary, she's gonna cook.

1508
01:40:35,290 --> 01:40:38,054
I'm stayin' open
Christmas Eve.

1509
01:40:38,127 --> 01:40:40,493
Oh, yeah.
Well, uh...

1510
01:40:40,562 --> 01:40:44,726
Maybe
after you close, huh?
Yeah, maybe.

1511
01:40:47,769 --> 01:40:53,105
- You take care, Ang.
- Yeah, Buddy.

1512
01:40:53,175 --> 01:40:55,939
[Chattering,
Indistinct]

1513
01:40:57,913 --> 01:41:01,007
[Laughing]

1514
01:41:07,956 --> 01:41:13,360
See that guy?
He threw his whole life away.

1515
01:41:17,432 --> 01:41:19,866
[Narrator]
It couldn't have been
any other way.

1516
01:41:19,935 --> 01:41:22,563
The very act
of bringing my mother
and myself into his home...

1517
01:41:22,638 --> 01:41:24,606
was blasphemy...

1518
01:41:24,673 --> 01:41:27,938
a rude rejection
of every value that had
ever been instilled in Buddy...

1519
01:41:28,010 --> 01:41:31,343
by his friends,
his family.

1520
01:41:35,017 --> 01:41:39,044

1531
01:42:28,099 --> 01:42:32,695
Thank you.
Thank you.

Silent
Fuckin'Night, huh?

1533
01:42:34,873 --> 01:42:36,841
Things'll get better.

1534
01:42:38,977 --> 01:42:42,037
Yeah, sure they will.

1535
01:42:44,182 --> 01:42:46,582
If they don't,
screw 'em.

1536
01:42:46,651 --> 01:42:49,711
[Door Opening]

1537
01:42:53,458 --> 01:42:58,088
[Wheezing Cough]
This place open?

1538
01:42:58,163 --> 01:43:00,757
Yeah, it sure is.

1539
01:43:00,832 --> 01:43:05,565
- Hey, you're my first customer.
- Well, I don't have any money.

1540
01:43:05,637 --> 01:43:07,798
[Chuckles]
Can you imagine?

1541
01:43:07,872 --> 01:43:10,568
The hell you supposed
to get a drink?
I was over at Angelo's.

1542
01:43:10,642 --> 01:43:14,100
I couldn't pay.
He said to come over here.

1543
01:43:14,179 --> 01:43:19,674
He said,
"They serve anybody
at Buddy's Tavern."

1544
01:43:27,892 --> 01:43:31,055
Have a seat, my friend.

1545
01:43:34,999 --> 01:43:37,900
What'll you have,
St. James?

1546
01:43:37,969 --> 01:43:40,369
Love one.

1547
01:43:45,910 --> 01:43:47,901
[Coughing]

1548
01:43:50,682 --> 01:43:54,277
Slow night.
We've only
just opened.

1549
01:44:00,124 --> 01:44:02,558
There you go.

1550
01:44:14,572 --> 01:44:16,733
[Narrator]
There would be many
slow nights in the future.

[Man Singing On Jukebox]
# I'm confessin'
that I love you #

1552
01:44:20,278 --> 01:44:23,372
But not enough to close the bar
which my father, Buddy Visalo,

1553
01:44:23,448 --> 01:44:27,441
ran until
his death in 1988.
# Tell me do you love me too #

1554
01:44:27,518 --> 01:44:29,412
And which my mother,
Mary Wylie Visalo,

1555
01:44:29,412 --> 01:44:32,074
And which my mother,
Mary Wylie Visalo,

1556
01:44:32,148 --> 01:44:34,082
ran until her death
last year.

1557

# Honest I do #

01:44:37,253 --> 01:44:40,086
Buddy's Tavern
