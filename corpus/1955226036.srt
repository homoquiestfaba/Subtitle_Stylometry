1
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:08,300
Do you love her?

2
00:01:18,071 --> 00:01:19,470
I know you do.

3
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,900
It's 5 kgs of cocaine.

4
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:39,500
I'm giving it to you.

5
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:44,300
Oh, but it fucking belongs to me.

6
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:48,600
Because I have something
that belongs to you.

7
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,800
You have 12 fucking hours.

8
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:14,380
CROSSING POINT

9
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,530
Nice. Nice

10
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:00,400
-  Trey.
-  I'm on vacation.

11
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:02,630
We're smuggling drugs in Mexico.

12
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:05,270
No, I wouldn't call it "smuggling".

13
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,360
What do you think the cops
are gonna call it down here, huh?

14
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:11,450
-  I don't know. "Gringo ??."? I don't know.
-  You're a fucking idiot.

15
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:15,300
Well, we made it through,
so I suggest we smoke it.

16
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:18,330
-  Of course you do.
-  Relax Michael.

17
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:20,500
It's Mexico, not Switzerland.

18
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,200
What do we have here?

19
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,500
Another gringo.

20
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:53,900
Well, detonated.

21
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:56,400
I do not know why keep coming here.

22
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:58,800
-  What do we have?
-  Nothing.

23
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:01,000
- Nothing?
- Nothing.

24
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:05,100
- I was not with the wallet?
- Not Identity or mobile.

25
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:09,750
Check digital and dental records.
Try to identify him.

26
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:13,870
- I will ask Hector to search for missing persons.
- Yes.

27
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:16,300
- He did not come alone.
- No.

28
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:19,400
Tony.

29
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:23,270
- How are your children?
- Very well.

30
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,800
- And wife?
- Let's taking.

31
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,730
Hey, aren't you going to surf?

32
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,700
The waves are too big for you, today?

33
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:21,300
Oh, my God.

34
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:25,900
Michael!

35
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:28,630
Let me go!

36
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:30,770
Let me go!

37
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:41,200
This is the place. Be ready.

38
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:42,900
Let's move.

39
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:44,900
Watch out.

40
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:09,400
And now?

41
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,730
We wait.

42
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:36,800
She's so fucking hot!

43
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:41,000
Are you sure
about this girl, honestly?

44
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:44,660
If she says "yes",
I'm gonna settle down with this one.

45
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:46,200
What?

46
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:48,900
No way.

47
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:50,930
After just six months?

48
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:54,200
Micheal, are you...
You're kidding, right?

49
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:58,100
So I guess you are not coming
to the club tonight.

50
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:38,100
There you go.

51
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:42,800
Ready? Come on.

52
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:56,270
- Are you ready?
- Affirmative.

53
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,330
Roger that. Let's move.

54
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:04,200
Door!

55
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:15,618
- Tony!?
- Keep 'em busy!

56
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,700
- Tony, are you there?
- Move!

57
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:19,970
Tony!?

58
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:23,300
- Damn it! Call reinforcement.
- Copy that.

59
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,500
Come on, let's go!

60
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:13,600
- What's the situation?
- Tony and the others died.

61
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:36,100
You look beautiful.

62
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:38,270
Thank you.

63
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:43,200
I told you this place is amazing.

64
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:48,600
Surreal, almost.
Not a lot of people around, huh?

65
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,400
You see those luxury hotels?

66
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:55,900
Unfinished.

67
00:11:58,070 --> 00:11:59,600
Yeah, they overbuilt.

68
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:01,370
Pay-time.

69
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:06,300
Well, just when their economy crashed,
the president declared war on drugs.

70
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:10,300
The media blew it out of proportions,
tourists got scared.

71
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:11,930
They stopped building.

72
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:18,200
I wanna meet your family.

73
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,930
Can I?

74
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:26,000
Please.

75
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:29,700
Sure. Let's do it.

76
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,770
Just let me get me bag from the room.

77
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,800
I'll see you in the lobby.

78
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:28,500
Do you really think that?
Fuck, no, man.

79
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:31,000
?? for the night, bro.

80
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:35,230
Here!

81
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:41,700
- Hello, sir.
- Come on.

82
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:44,600
Uh, what do you call the ??

83
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:26,600
Excuse me.

84
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:28,400
Hi.

85
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,870
Did you, by any chance, see a young woman?
She is wearing a pink dress.

86
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:34,700
She's about 5'7".

87
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:37,730
No, sir. I'm sorry. I didn't see.

88
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,870
- Alright. Thanks.
- You're welcome.

89
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:27,000
Hello?

90
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:30,800
Go to the hotel entrance.
You have two minutes. Come alone.

91
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:50,400
Get in! Come on!

92
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:53,230
Come on!

93
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:22,000
Oh, yeah!

94
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:34,900
I love you! I love you!

95
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:22,600
Paulina.

96
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,700
We lost.

97
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:03,630
You're gonna deliver it
across the border to San Diego.

98
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:11,000
If it's lost, stolen
or you get arrested, she'll die.

99
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:15,600
If it's damaged in any way,
she'll die.

100
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:17,200
It is there.

101
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:19,230
Thank you.

102
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:30,100
If you try to go back to your hotel
or contact the police, I'll know.

103
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:32,000
Because I'll be watching you,

104
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,800
And I your fucking throat myself.

105
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,400
- Destination?
- Tijuana.

106
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:01,670
Sign here, please.

107
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:05,500
Good morning, our last stop
will be in the central area.

108
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:10,100
The day is very hot,
keep the windows open, please. Thank you.

109
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:35,000
- Valence.
- We can we see mais tarde?

110
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:37,100
By noon.

111
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,500
- Can Be.
- Come alone. I'm working.

112
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:52,970
Are you okay?

113
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:55,400
- You don't look good.
- I am fine.

114
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,300
Wait.

115
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:02,500
Your eye is bleeding.

116
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:05,200
Can I?

117
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:18,470
Excuse me, sir.
Can I clean your boots?

118
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:22,800
- For 20 pesos, you've the shiny new.
- It's okay.

119
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,900
Is that the best you can do?

120
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,000
Look who is talking.

121
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:37,100
- Look at you. You look like a mouse.
- You smell like one.

122
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:43,800
Hey, I'm sorry about your partner.

123
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:46,300
Who told you that?

124
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:50,200
The street have ears.

125
00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:00,930
Something bad happened?

126
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,400
Tell me, what were you doing in Baja?

127
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:09,000
I just came down for my friend's surf.

128
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:12,330
What?

129
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:15,900
I live a mile from the beach and never go.

130
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,100
Maybe I should.

131
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:20,300
Yeah, you should.

132
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:23,800
What do you know about the gringos
found dead at the border?

133
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,900
The gringos are not my problem.

134
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,700
Maybe, they came looking for a problem
and they found it.

135
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:35,000
Or maybe they put where they should not.

136
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:36,600
Perhaps.

137
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:39,400
But I think it has something to do with drugs.

138
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:43,400
They found something?
There were drugs in the blood?

139
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:47,900
No. I seemed to do this,
but there are coincidences that can not be ignored.

140
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,900
People are taken.

141
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:56,600
They get one and force the other
to cross drugs.

142
00:21:56,970 --> 00:21:59,100
They can not cross themselves?

143
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,970
Because it is stolen.

144
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:05,600
Or a broken cartel controls the entire north.

145
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:08,930
How many dead?

146
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:12,600
Many.

147
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:44,500
We arrived in the central area.

148
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:47,230
Thank you for traveling
on the green bus.

149
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:50,230
Thanks. For cleaning me out.
- Tenham a great day.

150
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:10,000
Hey! Stop that girl!

151
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:22,000
She stole my backpack.

152
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,100
I want it back.

153
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,900
Kill him.

154
00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:27,970
Come on!

155
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,900
Finish him.

156
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:35,200
Fuck him, fuck him off.

157
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:36,730
Come on! Come on!

158
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:39,400
- Yeah!
- Yeah, yeah!

159
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:44,500
Come on! Come on!

160
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,400
Yeah!

161
00:27:05,170 --> 00:27:07,300
Hey, wait a minute.

162
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,700
Release the dogs.

163
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:14,400
- Enough!
- Shut up, Lucy!

164
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:20,600
Bring him up!

165
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:42,100
That was one hell of a move
you pulled down there.

166
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:45,500
But if you were me,
I would have let the train blow you.

167
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:50,100
It'd cut you right in half.

168
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,900
This does not belong to you.

169
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:57,900
Cartel often wrap their dope
in a specific manner.

170
00:27:58,170 --> 00:27:59,600
It's like a signature.

171
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:00,900
For example,

172
00:28:01,330 --> 00:28:05,200
The Venegas Cartel
wraps their dopes like a cocoon.

173
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:10,030
La Sombra wraps their dope crisscrossed.

174
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:15,000
This is crisscrossed. Unbroken seal.

175
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:20,800
Anyone of us try to move this dope...

176
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:22,570
It could start a war...

177
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:25,170
or be a death sentence.

178
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:28,430
What makes it less than worthless to me.

179
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,800
In fact, it is a liability.

180
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:34,430
I do not care who blocks you.

181
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:38,800
- I have to take it across the border.
- American bandit.

182
00:28:40,430 --> 00:28:45,600
Carrying a dope in Mexico?
You've to be willing to die.

183
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,300
Are you willing to die?

184
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:54,300
Yes.

185
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:56,900
And how did you plan
on carrying this across the border?

186
00:28:56,930 --> 00:29:00,870
I'm American. I'll just walk.
Or I'll buy my way across.

187
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:03,900
Why is the Americans' answer to everything is money?

188
00:29:07,130 --> 00:29:08,300
Listen.

189
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:12,200
I appreciate what you did for my niece.

190
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:14,100
I really do.

191
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:17,600
But you're going to have to leave. Now!

192
00:29:18,530 --> 00:29:20,000
This...

193
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:24,100
It puts us all at risk.

194
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,700
It's all yours.

195
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:34,800
Just in case you need a plan B...

196
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:37,300
Here.

197
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:40,970
Mermaids. They are going to tell the guardsmen
that you need to see Pedro.

198
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,470
Anybody ask you who sent you,
you tell them with a straight face:

199
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:46,600
"None of your damn business!"

200
00:29:47,570 --> 00:29:50,730
- Understood?
- Okay.

201
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:56,100
- You pull this, they'll understand.
- Why are you helping me out of this?

202
00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:00,600
Because saved my niece here.

203
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:04,100
Even after she tried to jack you.
That takes heart.

204
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,500
Do you know how to use it?

205
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:12,900
You take this part,
you slam it on someone's face.

206
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,500
Then all you have to do is point.

207
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:24,200
If travel with drugs in Mexico,
you're going to need this.

208
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,300
Thanks.

209
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:31,100
The border is that way.

210
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:34,300
Just look for the metal arc Revolución.

211
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:36,900
Gringo.

212
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:38,900
Be careful.

213
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:42,300
Take it easy.

214
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:44,770
What you want?

215
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:48,630
Michael? Olivia!? Hello!

216
00:31:51,670 --> 00:31:55,700
- It is better to ask someone to open the door.
- There's a guy at back in the hall.

217
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:16,400
But you can leave a message.
I'll call you back.

218
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:18,600
Dude, when you get this give me a call.

219
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:23,600
- Great.
- Please.

220
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:30,200
Michael? Olivia?

221
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:40,500
Try it again, dude.

222
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:45,200
Hi, this is Michael.
I'm not here right now.

223
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:47,700
But you can leave a message.
I'll call you back.

224
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:51,100
- This is voice-mail again.
- Are you kidding me?

225
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:53,770
Okay.

226
00:32:57,300 --> 00:33:01,000
- Reception. Can I help you?
- Yeah, Hi, uh...

227
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:04,200
I need some help.
We are actually looking for our friends.

228
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:14,100
Hector.

229
00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:17,000
How much is a coyote these days?

230
00:33:17,770 --> 00:33:20,900
About 10,000 or 15,000.

231
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:26,700
Why? Are you thinking of being one?

232
00:33:27,370 --> 00:33:28,700
I do not blame you.

233
00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:36,400
- The NSA also tracks serves up $10,000?
- Yes.

234
00:33:36,430 --> 00:33:37,900
Do me a favor.

235
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:40,770
Bring me the list of names of all the Americans.

236
00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:43,630
I need you to be more specific.

237
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:45,100
Men.

238
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:48,200
18 to 35.

239
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:53,000
In our region in the past 24 hours.

240
00:33:56,570 --> 00:33:59,600
Uh, is there any suspicion of murder?

241
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:04,230
No. Homicide, maybe.

242
00:34:24,570 --> 00:34:25,970
ACCESS RESTRICTED. ONLY WITH VALID PAPERWORK.

243
00:35:28,370 --> 00:35:30,600
We need to look into your bag, ma'am.

244
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:02,100
- Hello?
- I see you're making progress.

245
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:05,700
The next time we speak,
you'll be on the other side.

246
00:36:06,770 --> 00:36:11,500
- Don't try anything stupid.
- Hey, wait. I wanna talk to her.

247
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:13,900
I need to know if she's okay.

248
00:36:15,530 --> 00:36:16,700
Hello?

249
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:34,630
APARTMENT FOR RENT

250
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:50,500
You're looking for something to steal?

251
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:53,570
I thought of going through drugs,

252
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,900
but I guessed you have that over already.

253
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,800
Get in. I'll take you to plan B.

254
00:38:04,370 --> 00:38:05,600
Come on.

255
00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:22,000
Are you sure you wanna ride with me
and these drugs?

256
00:38:22,330 --> 00:38:24,800
I'm not planning
on getting caught, are you?

257
00:38:31,070 --> 00:38:33,800
I'm sorry trying to steal your bag.

258
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:35,800
You were an easy mark.

259
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:42,130
Not, really. Thank you
for pulling me off the track.

260
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:44,100
I owe you my life.

261
00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:58,600
What's the deal with this guy, Pedro?

262
00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:01,330
He's a coyote.

263
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,870
He will help you to get across
but I don't trust him.

264
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:07,000
Why not?

265
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:09,700
You have money?

266
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:14,100
- Not much.
- You need money.

267
00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:16,300
A good coyote is expensive.

268
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,430
- Do you want me to come with you?
- No. I got this.

269
00:39:21,970 --> 00:39:23,250
But thank you.

270
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:25,870
I still owe you.

271
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:27,600
We're even.

272
00:39:40,370 --> 00:39:42,000
How can I help you?

273
00:39:42,170 --> 00:39:44,100
I need to see Pedro.

274
00:39:44,530 --> 00:39:46,000
Who sent you?

275
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:48,500
None of your fucking business!

276
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:52,100
Andrés, huh? Get in there.

277
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:17,800
I'm here to see Pedro.

278
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:22,730
Go do something.

279
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,500
A gun?

280
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:33,100
I think you might sit down yourself. Sit down.

281
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:45,600
Andres is who gave you this pistol or you are so bad-ass motherfucker you took it from him.

282
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:49,800
- I guess the former?
- He said you could help me.

283
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:59,700
- I need to get across the border.
- Hey, I thought white boys cross the border legally.

284
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:05,400
It must have something to do with this bag, right?

285
00:41:09,270 --> 00:41:11,570
I have to get across the border cross.
Are you gonna help me or not?

286
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:14,200
So ,what are you gonna do?
Hop the fence like a goddamn ???

287
00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:17,200
Hey, you need a pro to take you, okay?

288
00:41:17,330 --> 00:41:20,770
It is an hour's drive to the East
over the roughest terrain Mexico has to offer.

289
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:24,850
You'll be dodging criminals,
out-laws, dirty cops, federals,

290
00:41:24,870 --> 00:41:27,770
not to mention the cartel,
whose land will be trespassed on.

291
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:31,700
Listen to this:
you do not know where to cross.

292
00:41:32,530 --> 00:41:34,500
I don't give a shit
what's in the bag. Right?

293
00:41:34,530 --> 00:41:37,400
Kinda give a shit
but listen to me and notice,

294
00:41:37,430 --> 00:41:40,700
you screw the wrong motherfucker
down here,

295
00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:44,600
they'll cut your face off
and preach on a soccer ball.

296
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:49,400
I'm that "wrong motherfucker".

297
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:51,900
Did you understand what I said?

298
00:41:52,730 --> 00:41:54,100
Yeah?

299
00:41:54,370 --> 00:41:58,530
- Okay, when to cross?
- As soon as possible.

300
00:41:58,550 --> 00:42:00,550
- Hours or days?
- Hours.

301
00:42:00,570 --> 00:42:02,300
How much money do you got?

302
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:05,300
About $500.

303
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:07,400
$500?

304
00:42:11,530 --> 00:42:13,100
$500!!?

305
00:42:13,770 --> 00:42:18,000
You are joking with me, right?
You need $10,000!

306
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:22,150
Now, there is a problem 'cause of this.

307
00:42:22,170 --> 00:42:25,770
You take your ass up ??
right now, okay?

308
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:28,000
Go to the bank, get the money.

309
00:42:28,030 --> 00:42:30,930
Don't forget the money.
Bring your ass here as fast as you can,

310
00:42:30,950 --> 00:42:33,270
will return to the US until the late afternoon.

311
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:35,100
- Deal?
- Okay.

312
00:42:35,530 --> 00:42:38,000
Are you forgetting something?
Leave the bag.

313
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:40,000
Oh, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna need my passport.

314
00:42:40,530 --> 00:42:43,500
It's not what you're gonna need.
I'm gonna tell you what you gonna need, okay?

315
00:42:43,530 --> 00:42:46,900
You're not gonna need this fucking bag.
The bag is collateral. Alright?

316
00:42:47,170 --> 00:42:50,830
It's safer here with me.

317
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:53,300
You get it?
Take your passport.

318
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:54,700
Get out of here.

319
00:42:55,930 --> 00:42:58,500
Get the fuck out, man.

320
00:43:00,550 --> 00:43:02,170
Rosy, cheer us out here.

321
00:44:03,670 --> 00:44:06,500
- Will you cash all of these? Okay?
- Okay.

322
00:44:06,530 --> 00:44:09,500
Start with this one.
Max out what you can.

323
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:37,100
- Mr. Taylor, is everything alright?
- Pardon.

324
00:44:38,370 --> 00:44:42,600
Do you mind to take off
your hat and glasses?

325
00:44:53,030 --> 00:44:56,670
I wonder if this is some sort of emergency?

326
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:59,500
No. No emergency.
Just a rough night.

327
00:44:59,870 --> 00:45:05,400
As you understand the interest
and fees on cashing are very high.

328
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:10,500
Perhaps, I could arrange
a wire-transfer from another source.

329
00:45:10,530 --> 00:45:12,770
No. No, that's fine.

330
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:15,700
Just give me the money, please.
I'm in a hurry.

331
00:45:15,730 --> 00:45:19,700
On cash withdrawals
of more than $10.000...

332
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:24,600
- we'll need you to fill out some forms.
- Yeah. It's fine.

333
00:45:24,830 --> 00:45:26,600
Come with me, please.

334
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:08,970
TORPEDO MOVING

335
00:46:14,670 --> 00:46:16,500
What do you think of them?

336
00:46:17,830 --> 00:46:19,670
Who? The pudgy?

337
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:25,400
Look at them.
They barely fit in the elevator, imagine the tunnel.

338
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:27,600
Just a thought.

339
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:55,100
- Hey, baby.
- He is on his way.

340
00:46:55,830 --> 00:46:57,700
He is paying for the coyote.

341
00:46:59,230 --> 00:47:01,200
I want more this time.

342
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:06,400
You okay where we agreed.

343
00:47:06,630 --> 00:47:07,900
Mateo.

344
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,500
I want more.

345
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:37,170
Hey. Hey, relax scared man.

346
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:40,000
Come on, this is... You don't know
the treat, man? It's for the business.

347
00:47:40,030 --> 00:47:41,700
Alright? Be cool. There.

348
00:47:48,270 --> 00:47:51,500
Hey! My fucking money?
You got the money?

349
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:54,600
Good.

350
00:47:57,700 --> 00:48:00,390
Hey, you know what?
You can tell my probation officer...

351
00:48:00,570 --> 00:48:04,600
I'm going to Mexico?
I will miss on Wednesday at 15h.

352
00:48:58,950 --> 00:49:01,600
Hey, boss!
I think I found something.

353
00:49:05,030 --> 00:49:06,600
What did you find?

354
00:49:07,330 --> 00:49:09,050
Michael Taylor.

355
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:22,450
Hello?

356
00:49:23,870 --> 00:49:25,500
Have you heard anything?

357
00:49:27,530 --> 00:49:29,700
Okay. We'll... We'll be up here.

358
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:31,700
Come on up.

359
00:49:32,570 --> 00:49:33,730
Thank you.

360
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:44,700
Wars and conflicts.

361
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:47,900
They do not come from your desires that...

362
00:49:47,970 --> 00:49:50,330
- American?
- Yeah.

363
00:49:50,470 --> 00:49:54,100
Uh, my name is Gabriel.
I am from Nicaragua.

364
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:57,100
- You know Nicaragua?
- I do.

365
00:49:57,600 --> 00:50:00,600
- May I ask you a question?
- Sure.

366
00:50:00,630 --> 00:50:02,500
What are you doing here?

367
00:50:03,970 --> 00:50:05,670
Just trying to get across.

368
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:08,300
- Same as you.
- Uh, huh, no. "Same as you"?

369
00:50:08,330 --> 00:50:10,150
Well, you're not same as me.

370
00:50:10,170 --> 00:50:13,300
You are American.
You're going home.

371
00:50:14,870 --> 00:50:16,600
I don't want any trouble.

372
00:50:16,870 --> 00:50:18,900
I'm just trying to get across.

373
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:22,300
Perhaps, we're same.

374
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:24,870
Or they think Scripture
says in vain:

375
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:29,500
He jealously desires the Spirit
who lives in us.

376
00:50:29,730 --> 00:50:34,230
However, it gives us the greatest grace.
So I said, God resists the proud...

377
00:50:45,930 --> 00:50:47,900
- Hi, gentlemen.
- Hello.

378
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:50,900
Do you recognize this person?

379
00:50:55,270 --> 00:50:59,700
- Yeah, that's him.
- Yeah. It is Michael Taylor.

380
00:51:00,470 --> 00:51:01,670
Excuse me.

381
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,500
Hi, Jesus.

382
00:51:10,170 --> 00:51:14,000
- Yes, that's him. I will send friends home.
- Very good.

383
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:17,670
Do they know
why he drew the money in Tijuana?

384
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:19,570
They do not know.

385
00:51:20,130 --> 00:51:21,600
They do not know.

386
00:51:21,630 --> 00:51:23,370
We discover something about Olivia.

387
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:26,470
- Olivia?
- Olivia Duran, his girlfriend.

388
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:28,360
- She is Mexican?
- Yes.

389
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:30,670
We investigate,
but found nothing.

390
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:33,200
No address, no phone.

391
00:51:33,730 --> 00:51:36,200
Her mother died in childbirth in Tijuana.

392
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:39,100
We don't know much
about her father.

393
00:51:39,170 --> 00:51:44,500
We know that she entered
several times in the USA.

394
00:51:44,770 --> 00:51:46,930
We are checking.

395
00:51:46,970 --> 00:51:49,000
Tell his friends
that everything will be fine.

396
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:50,900
Good job.

397
00:52:06,530 --> 00:52:08,300
Submit to God.

398
00:52:08,370 --> 00:52:12,900
Resist the devil
and he will flee from you.

399
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:16,630
- How much longer?
- Not long, Michael.

400
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,400
Cleanse your hands, sinners.

401
00:52:18,430 --> 00:52:19,900
How do you know my name?

402
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:21,470
Gringo!

403
00:52:36,250 --> 00:52:39,200
FIRST CHURCH OF MEXICO

404
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:45,150
Brothers, do not speak ill
of each other.

405
00:52:45,170 --> 00:52:48,470
He who speaks evil
of a brother...

406
00:52:51,430 --> 00:52:54,350
If you judge the truth,
then it does not meet...

407
00:52:59,135 --> 00:53:03,231
...it is able to save
and to destroy.

408
00:53:03,370 --> 00:53:06,400
Is that you? Who are you?

409
00:53:06,470 --> 00:53:07,840
Please, please!

410
00:53:07,900 --> 00:53:10,500
- Don't... Don't hurt me.
- I'm not gonna hurt you.

411
00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:12,600
They were going to kill me.

412
00:53:19,430 --> 00:53:20,700
Let's go.

413
00:53:36,830 --> 00:53:38,700
What you want? Huh?

414
00:53:39,370 --> 00:53:42,530
I want to talk to Pedro
to see what happened to the American.

415
00:53:42,590 --> 00:53:45,200
The American? Why?

416
00:53:46,370 --> 00:53:49,000
I just want to know if he went through.

417
00:53:54,930 --> 00:53:56,300
It's okay.

418
00:53:57,500 --> 00:53:58,800
I'll call.

419
00:53:59,930 --> 00:54:01,079
Thanks.

420
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:17,900
ALSO ON THIS SIDE THERE DREAMS

421
00:54:34,870 --> 00:54:37,400
- Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much.
- Good luck.

422
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:06,600
This is crisscrossed.
Unbroken seal.

423
00:55:08,570 --> 00:55:11,600
Hey. My fucking money?
You get the money?

424
00:55:11,730 --> 00:55:14,380
Hey, you know what?
You can tell my probation officer...

425
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:16,758
I'm going to Mexico?

426
00:55:18,770 --> 00:55:20,200
Pedro.

427
00:55:41,430 --> 00:55:45,000
I think we got
a rabbit on the run here, huh?

428
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:49,430
- I'm American.
- We will see about that.

429
00:55:50,130 --> 00:55:52,600
On your knees, boy. Now.

430
00:55:55,070 --> 00:55:56,700
Easy now.

431
00:55:57,700 --> 00:56:00,100
- I'm reaching for my passport.
- Okay.

432
00:56:05,370 --> 00:56:06,630
What do you think?

433
00:56:09,830 --> 00:56:11,700
Okay. Get up.

434
00:56:13,270 --> 00:56:16,400
- What are you doing out here, boy?
- It's a long story.

435
00:56:17,170 --> 00:56:19,300
How about making it a short one?

436
00:56:19,670 --> 00:56:22,770
What happened to your face?
He took a beat up there?

437
00:56:23,830 --> 00:56:25,400
What's in the bag?

438
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:32,770
- I asked you what's in the bag.
- It's my belongings.

439
00:56:32,900 --> 00:56:34,230
Show Us.

440
00:56:35,170 --> 00:56:38,900
- This is America. You have no right...
- Show us what's in the bag!

441
00:56:39,278 --> 00:56:40,600
Now!

442
00:56:43,870 --> 00:56:45,300
Thank you.

443
00:56:45,730 --> 00:56:47,100
Open.

444
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,800
You. On the ground, now!

445
00:57:08,470 --> 00:57:10,900
The passport. Throw it to me.

446
00:57:16,370 --> 00:57:19,000
Now, cuff yourself to him.

447
00:57:20,070 --> 00:57:22,000
You should be ashamed.

448
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:32,200
- Throw me the keys.
- No!.

449
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:44,100
Really?

450
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,900
Hey! Where are you going? Hey!

451
00:57:53,330 --> 00:57:55,300
What do you think you're doing?

452
00:57:56,370 --> 00:57:57,700
Hey!

453
00:58:17,730 --> 00:58:19,800
He was just at the border, man.

454
00:58:20,170 --> 00:58:23,700
- Now it looks like he's turning around.
- What's going on?

455
00:58:27,730 --> 00:58:31,200
Look, your fucking boyfriend
is getting ?.

456
00:58:32,270 --> 00:58:36,600
- I thought he was being followed.
- Or maybe his backpack was stolen, man.

457
00:58:37,700 --> 00:58:41,200
Hey, you're still paying me!
I did my part.

458
00:58:41,870 --> 00:58:43,300
Mateo.

459
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:47,500
Anytime you fucking go back
to where I found you.

460
00:58:52,170 --> 00:58:53,800
He could have been jumped.

461
00:59:10,830 --> 00:59:13,000
Is there a problem, my friend?

462
00:59:13,230 --> 00:59:16,670
- No. I'm on schedule.
- If you don't make delivery,

463
00:59:16,700 --> 00:59:20,170
she's not the only one that's gonna die,
do you understand me?

464
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:22,700
You've less than three fucking hours.

465
00:59:43,130 --> 00:59:46,500
I'm looking for an American,
Michael Taylor.

466
00:59:46,700 --> 00:59:51,400
He drew $12,000 from a local bank
to pay a coyote.

467
00:59:51,830 --> 00:59:54,034
We believe that he
is being forced to be mule...

468
00:59:54,050 --> 00:59:56,370
with drugs stolen from a cartel.

469
00:59:57,670 --> 00:59:59,470
Do not be afraid of retaliation.

470
00:59:59,900 --> 01:00:06,100
We find this  American, and the supplier,
we will do a favor to the cartels.

471
01:00:07,470 --> 01:00:10,350
These are the most common points of crossing.

472
01:00:10,370 --> 01:00:14,630
If he came to one of them,
it is too late.

473
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:37,970
- You switched it, you son of a bitch.
- Hey, relax. Just put the gun down.

474
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,300
- And you tried to have your men kill me!
- Put the gun down.

475
01:00:40,370 --> 01:00:42,970
- I'm not going out like that.
- Okay. It's cool

476
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,270
- What you want from me?
- I want it back!

477
01:00:45,300 --> 01:00:47,600
Hey, fuck you.
I can't do this, alright?

478
01:00:50,530 --> 01:00:52,400
Okay. Okay.

479
01:00:52,470 --> 01:00:54,600
Alright. It's up here.

480
01:00:55,170 --> 01:00:57,870
Alright.
Just don't shoot me, alright?

481
01:00:57,900 --> 01:00:59,700
I like my head.
I don't wanna lose it.

482
01:01:05,070 --> 01:01:08,000
Hey, look. Look.
This isn't yours.

483
01:01:08,030 --> 01:01:11,270
It's not yours. It's not, okay?

484
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:14,970
They will want back and will want to know...

485
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,070
They will want to know who gave you this.

486
01:01:17,100 --> 01:01:19,224
So they are fucking gonna kill me.

487
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:21,600
And they're definitely gonna kill you!

488
01:01:23,030 --> 01:01:25,600
Hey, look. Look, smart-ass.

489
01:01:25,830 --> 01:01:27,230
You tell me yourself.

490
01:02:33,300 --> 01:02:36,300
- I told you I didn't trust him.
- Good call.

491
01:02:36,330 --> 01:02:39,200
My uncle called Pedro
and sniffed out his bullshit.

492
01:02:39,300 --> 01:02:41,700
He's going to get the sewers ?.

493
01:02:41,970 --> 01:02:44,000
Andrés protected you.

494
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:47,200
We don't take that lightly around here.

495
01:02:52,900 --> 01:02:54,930
Are you gonna come clean now?

496
01:02:55,830 --> 01:02:57,700
They kidnapped my girlfriend.

497
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,700
And told me to take these drugs
across the border.

498
01:03:01,070 --> 01:03:04,100
An hour left before they kill her.

499
01:03:06,170 --> 01:03:09,900
- Well, how's that funny?
- I wish someone ?.

500
01:03:18,470 --> 01:03:20,170
Listen, I'm running out of time.

501
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:23,300
We're gonna take the tunnel.
It's simple as that.

502
01:04:03,100 --> 01:04:07,530
- Valencia.
- Jesus. It is the terminal 4.

503
01:04:07,670 --> 01:04:11,300
I believe that the American
has just appeared.

504
01:04:19,930 --> 01:04:21,300
Follow me.

505
01:04:24,270 --> 01:04:25,500
This way.

506
01:04:27,630 --> 01:04:29,000
This way.

507
01:04:35,270 --> 01:04:38,300
It's gonna be okay.
You'll get her back.

508
01:04:40,030 --> 01:04:43,800
- Where is it?
- You are standing on it.

509
01:04:52,700 --> 01:04:56,700
- You're on your own from here.
- Thanks.

510
01:04:57,300 --> 01:04:58,900
Now we're even.

511
01:05:04,230 --> 01:05:07,400
You need to go, Michael.
Go! Now go!

512
01:05:12,270 --> 01:05:15,300
Move! Please, go, Michael!

513
01:05:15,700 --> 01:05:17,200
Go, go, go, go.

514
01:06:02,170 --> 01:06:04,130
Baby, it's all coming together.

515
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:10,900
- Cheers.
- Cheers

516
01:07:05,430 --> 01:07:06,530
Mateo.

517
01:07:09,930 --> 01:07:14,208
The kid is in US soil, man.
We need to get our people in place now.

518
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:23,500
Are you sure you can't give me
something extra this time?

519
01:07:25,900 --> 01:07:28,900
Don't worry. I'll make you.

520
01:08:16,230 --> 01:08:19,100
Michael Taylor,
I've been looking for you.

521
01:08:20,430 --> 01:08:22,370
Jesus Valencia, Tijuana Police.

522
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:24,600
I know they have Olivia.

523
01:08:28,830 --> 01:08:32,300
- You know who's got her?
- We're close.

524
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:35,300
If we're together,
we can find them.

525
01:08:39,770 --> 01:08:41,870
No, if I talk to the police,
they'll kill her.

526
01:08:41,900 --> 01:08:45,970
- Can I help you, Michael.
- I can't take her chance. I'm sorry.

527
01:08:46,230 --> 01:08:49,800
You do this on your own,
neither one of you will survive.

528
01:08:50,930 --> 01:08:53,000
This guy don't like loose ends.

529
01:08:53,430 --> 01:08:55,100
You help me find them...

530
01:08:55,830 --> 01:08:57,400
I'll let you walk.

531
01:09:02,030 --> 01:09:03,570
Give me the gun.

532
01:09:06,730 --> 01:09:08,430
I don't have much time.

533
01:09:08,900 --> 01:09:10,700
You don't need much time.

534
01:09:26,970 --> 01:09:28,970
We set a sting op on our side,

535
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,670
Mr. Valencia has Mateo's residence in Tijuana.

536
01:09:31,700 --> 01:09:35,100
He's telling the truth. He say when you're
the US side of the border near the crossing...

537
01:09:35,130 --> 01:09:37,670
Don't give him a chance to ask you questions.
You ask him about Olivia.

538
01:09:37,670 --> 01:09:39,900
Say, she is still alive?
Say, you wanna speak to her.

539
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,100
Probably, he'll refuse, but it's okay.

540
01:09:44,170 --> 01:09:47,430
When he tells you where to make the drop,
you keep it nice and slow.

541
01:09:47,450 --> 01:09:50,200
If he says you need 30 minutes,
you say you need 45.

542
01:09:51,030 --> 01:09:53,170
You gotta buy us as much time
as you can, Michael.

543
01:09:53,230 --> 01:09:56,030
Do not know.
They're tracking the phone, I think.

544
01:09:56,050 --> 01:09:59,600
He is. But don't worry,
this place does not exist.

545
01:10:10,500 --> 01:10:13,100
Hey, kid, come on. Hey.
Keep it together.

546
01:10:13,130 --> 01:10:15,800
Hang in there.
Just a bit long, okay?

547
01:10:16,230 --> 01:10:18,100
We do this every day.

548
01:10:19,150 --> 01:10:20,600
You're gonna be okay.

549
01:10:21,630 --> 01:10:23,200
We've an incoming.

550
01:10:25,430 --> 01:10:27,000
Fucking idiot.

551
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:31,070
So, backtrack this number to an address in Tijuana.

552
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:36,100
It is registered to a Mateo Fuentes.
And guess what?

553
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:38,100
He's on our watch-list.

554
01:10:42,970 --> 01:10:44,300
Is that him?

555
01:10:48,830 --> 01:10:51,000
Just give me another minute to trace.

556
01:10:57,570 --> 01:10:58,800
Hello?

557
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:02,000
- You made it?
- I did.

558
01:11:02,900 --> 01:11:06,000
- Where the fuck are you?
- San Isidro.

559
01:11:08,930 --> 01:11:10,500
Very good friend.

560
01:11:10,700 --> 01:11:13,030
- You got my shit?
- I have it.

561
01:11:13,930 --> 01:11:15,200
Okay.

562
01:11:16,300 --> 01:11:19,100
What about Olivia?
I wanna talk to her.

563
01:11:20,170 --> 01:11:23,700
You can talk to her after.
It's what we agreed.

564
01:11:24,130 --> 01:11:25,700
Tell me what to do.

565
01:11:26,030 --> 01:11:29,100
Go to Chicano Park,
look for a lady, Guadalupe.

566
01:11:30,070 --> 01:11:32,600
There will be a bin with a red X.

567
01:11:33,030 --> 01:11:36,870
Make the fucking drop inside
and get the hell out of there.

568
01:11:37,030 --> 01:11:39,000
When do I get to see her?

569
01:11:39,500 --> 01:11:41,400
After we verify the product.

570
01:11:41,630 --> 01:11:43,300
I need more time.

571
01:11:43,970 --> 01:11:46,150
- I'm on foot.
- Take a damn taxi.

572
01:11:46,170 --> 01:11:48,700
You have 30 minutes
or she is dead.

573
01:11:50,930 --> 01:11:52,670
- I got him.
- Okay, time to go.

574
01:11:52,700 --> 01:11:55,000
I'll ? the trace.
We're all clear, Jesus.

575
01:11:55,030 --> 01:11:59,230
We're going to get this guy.
We're going to bring back Olivia unharmed.

576
01:11:59,250 --> 01:12:00,900
I'm going with you.

577
01:12:54,570 --> 01:12:57,300
The drop will be made
​​in 30 minutes or less.

578
01:12:57,530 --> 01:13:00,200
Make sure you check the fucking bag
before you get out.

579
01:13:04,030 --> 01:13:07,400
As soon as the drop is made,
kill him.

580
01:13:48,370 --> 01:13:49,800
Hey, Mateo.

581
01:13:49,830 --> 01:13:53,200
- He just dropped the bag bag, but...
- But what?

582
01:13:53,300 --> 01:13:56,437
He's just standing there.
He's not fucking leaving.

583
01:14:01,270 --> 01:14:04,000
Get my shit
and slice his fucking throat.

584
01:14:04,100 --> 01:14:07,300
- What? Right here?
- What the fuck did I just tell you?

585
01:14:07,330 --> 01:14:08,900
Just fucking do it!

586
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:12,300
Just fucking do it, man.

587
01:14:15,300 --> 01:14:17,130
We got movement.

588
01:14:17,430 --> 01:14:18,900
Wait for my call.

589
01:14:32,600 --> 01:14:34,100
Hey, white boy!

590
01:14:35,030 --> 01:14:39,000
Freeze! Freeze!
Hands on the floor. Now! Now!

591
01:14:39,270 --> 01:14:41,000
On your knees! Now!

592
01:14:41,430 --> 01:14:44,800
Hands! Hands!
Hands on the floor. Now!

593
01:14:45,730 --> 01:14:47,200
Copy!

594
01:15:46,660 --> 01:15:48,700
Hey, something is fucking wrong, man.

595
01:16:02,330 --> 01:16:04,800
What the hell!
Where the fuck is my shit!?

596
01:16:07,170 --> 01:16:08,400
Boom!

597
01:16:19,570 --> 01:16:20,730
Move!

598
01:16:25,830 --> 01:16:27,300
Let's go! Let's go!

599
01:16:34,900 --> 01:16:36,300
What the fuck...

600
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:41,400
Stop right there!

601
01:16:49,630 --> 01:16:51,500
You fucking bitch!

602
01:17:02,870 --> 01:17:03,970
It's okay.

603
01:17:07,370 --> 01:17:09,100
It's over, man.

604
01:17:22,530 --> 01:17:24,100
Michael!

605
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:31,300
You're safe now.

606
01:17:31,870 --> 01:17:33,900
Michael, I wanna go home.

607
01:17:37,500 --> 01:17:38,900
Michael.

608
01:17:58,600 --> 01:18:01,700
- So, you just took?
- Yeah.

609
01:18:02,170 --> 01:18:03,600
It's mine.

610
01:18:03,700 --> 01:18:07,600
The guy tried to kill me, so I figure
he at least owe me that much.

611
01:18:08,130 --> 01:18:09,900
My hero.

612
01:19:19,800 --> 01:19:22,900
- Hello?
- Michael, this is Jesus, Tijuana Police.

613
01:19:23,630 --> 01:19:27,630
We found a copy of Mateo's phone logs
and found his connection to you.

614
01:19:27,700 --> 01:19:29,500
It's Olivia Duran.

615
01:19:29,930 --> 01:19:32,500
We're tracking your phone.
We're on our way to you.

616
01:19:32,870 --> 01:19:35,150
If you're with her,
you are in danger, Micheal.

617
01:19:35,170 --> 01:19:36,500
You understand me?

618
01:19:38,070 --> 01:19:39,300
No, that's great!

619
01:19:39,330 --> 01:19:41,900
We're actually just on our way
to meet her family.

620
01:19:43,130 --> 01:19:45,200
I'll call you later.

621
01:19:46,100 --> 01:19:47,400
Okay.

622
01:19:48,570 --> 01:19:52,100
- Who were you talking to?
- Just the guys. Checking up on us.

623
01:19:52,600 --> 01:19:53,930
Are you okay?

624
01:19:55,730 --> 01:19:56,730
Yeah.

625
01:19:57,300 --> 01:20:00,300
I'm just gonna go the bathroom
and I'll be right back.

626
01:20:19,470 --> 01:20:21,800
They still have to chose you
for a reason.

627
01:22:01,830 --> 01:22:04,370
This was "Between War and Love".

628
01:22:04,400 --> 01:22:07,900
One of my favorite.
Let's continue.

629
01:22:15,630 --> 01:22:17,600
Michael?

630
01:22:21,330 --> 01:22:23,400
I can smell it.

631
01:22:24,270 --> 01:22:26,100
I know you're back here.

632
01:22:47,800 --> 01:22:50,230
You know, I have to tell you.

633
01:22:50,700 --> 01:22:52,400
I've done this before.

634
01:22:52,970 --> 01:22:56,770
And you made it more interesting
than any of them.

635
01:22:56,800 --> 01:22:59,300
But you had to mess it up,
didn't you?

636
01:22:59,770 --> 01:23:02,400
Why couldn't you do
what your were asked?

637
01:23:04,870 --> 01:23:07,700
You cost me Michael.

638
01:23:09,270 --> 01:23:12,900
And now what?
You're gonna turn me in?

639
01:23:15,830 --> 01:23:18,000
Not gonna happen.

640
01:24:01,070 --> 01:24:03,300
If you needed money,
you could have asked.

641
01:24:05,100 --> 01:24:07,000
I would have done anything for you.

642
01:24:07,370 --> 01:24:10,130
Men just wanna use me
for my body. That's it.

643
01:24:11,330 --> 01:24:13,000
And you're no different.

644
01:24:14,070 --> 01:24:17,400
So, you wanna
do something for me now?

645
01:24:18,130 --> 01:24:21,030
Well, you can.
You can burn.

646
01:24:39,770 --> 01:24:42,600
Michael, what are you doing?

647
01:24:42,900 --> 01:24:44,830
You are insane?

648
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,700
Micheal, you don't have to do this.

649
01:24:49,170 --> 01:24:51,000
You always have a choice.

650
01:25:05,870 --> 01:25:08,100
Michael, help me!

651
01:25:08,770 --> 01:25:12,000
Come here, Micheal!
Help me!

652
01:25:23,500 --> 01:25:26,300
Michael, help me!

653
01:25:37,170 --> 01:25:38,830
Hopefully! Hopefully!

654
01:25:40,330 --> 01:25:41,800
Michael, what happened?

655
01:25:42,830 --> 01:25:44,100
Where's Olivia?

656
01:25:45,400 --> 01:25:46,400
Be careful.

657
01:25:46,430 --> 01:25:49,000
I've secured her in the back.
She is covered in gasoline.

658
01:25:49,030 --> 01:25:50,600
She's a lighter.

659
01:25:50,970 --> 01:25:52,470
She killed the clerk.

660
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:56,830
She's back there. Go!

661
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:08,000
Thank you.

662
01:26:08,570 --> 01:26:11,600
- You saved me twice.
- I was just doing my job.

663
01:26:12,930 --> 01:26:16,700
Michael, there's something for you
in the glove compartment.

664
01:26:17,200 --> 01:26:18,600
Good luck.

665
01:27:34,100 --> 01:27:36,000
Dropping the gun, cowboy?

666
01:27:36,200 --> 01:27:37,700
Something like that.

667
01:27:39,430 --> 01:27:41,500
This is why
you came all the way here?

668
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:48,000
