1
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,799
I heard this big bang
and then the building is falling down!

2
00:01:13,836 --> 00:01:15,599
It looks like a second plane.

3
00:01:15,638 --> 00:01:19,438
The US military has begun strikes.
... cases of anthrax...

4
00:01:19,475 --> 00:01:24,071
We need every tool that's available to us.
Tools that respect...

5
00:01:24,113 --> 00:01:28,072
My focus
is bringing al-Qaeda to justice.

6
00:01:28,117 --> 00:01:32,417
Say, theoretically,
that the government of the United States

7
00:01:32,455 --> 00:01:35,720
could rid the world of terrorism forever,

8
00:01:35,758 --> 00:01:38,386
but only if for a single day,

9
00:01:38,428 --> 00:01:42,592
you gave up all of your rights
as American citizens.

10
00:01:42,632 --> 00:01:47,069
24 hours with no rights.
What would you say? Would you do it?

11
00:01:47,103 --> 00:01:48,798
Sure.

12
00:01:48,838 --> 00:01:53,639
OK. The government says
it could rid the world of terrorism forever...

13
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:57,004
if you give up all of your rights for...

14
00:01:58,314 --> 00:01:59,303
a week.

15
00:01:59,348 --> 00:02:01,748
Would you do it? Come on. A week.

16
00:02:01,784 --> 00:02:03,945
A week. A week, all right?

17
00:02:05,087 --> 00:02:06,076
A month?

18
00:02:08,991 --> 00:02:10,583
A year? A year.

19
00:02:10,626 --> 00:02:12,423
Just a year.

20
00:02:12,462 --> 00:02:14,123
Ten years?

21
00:02:14,163 --> 00:02:15,892
- Ten years.
- No.

22
00:02:15,932 --> 00:02:17,695
A lifetime.

23
00:02:17,733 --> 00:02:20,600
Absolutely not. No way.

24
00:03:13,089 --> 00:03:15,080
Sorry. Sorry.

25
00:04:16,586 --> 00:04:18,349
Are you uncomfortable?

26
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:23,320
I'll bet you are uncomfortable.

27
00:04:25,595 --> 00:04:27,927
Do you promise to behave?

28
00:04:36,706 --> 00:04:38,435
How's that?

29
00:04:38,474 --> 00:04:40,169
That's better.

30
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:49,481
I'm a public servant.

31
00:04:49,518 --> 00:04:51,110
I'm here to serve.

32
00:04:52,154 --> 00:04:53,712
Why am I here?

33
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:59,985
Were you hurt
when the officers arrested you?

34
00:05:00,029 --> 00:05:01,360
Arrested?

35
00:05:01,397 --> 00:05:03,888
I told them to be respectful.

36
00:05:05,401 --> 00:05:09,235
Why have I been arrested?
I haven't done anything wrong.

37
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:22,881
Filthy habit.

38
00:05:22,918 --> 00:05:24,351
Unhealthy.

39
00:05:24,387 --> 00:05:27,185
Listen. I know that I'm a foreigner,

40
00:05:27,223 --> 00:05:32,684
and as such I may not be aware
of all the laws that you people have,

41
00:05:32,728 --> 00:05:36,220
but I swear I can't imagine
what crime I've committed.

42
00:05:36,265 --> 00:05:39,894
- How long have you been in this country?
- A year. Maybe a little more.

43
00:05:39,935 --> 00:05:42,904
I can see how that may not be enough time
to learn our laws.

44
00:05:42,938 --> 00:05:44,963
Not all of them, no. Basics.

45
00:05:45,941 --> 00:05:48,967
You know, the ones
that are common everywhere.

46
00:05:49,011 --> 00:05:52,469
- Against murder and stealing...
- Perhaps I misspoke.

47
00:05:52,515 --> 00:05:57,145
You were not arrested.
You've simply been brought in for questioning.

48
00:05:57,186 --> 00:05:58,710
An interrogation?

49
00:05:59,855 --> 00:06:00,879
An interview.

50
00:06:00,923 --> 00:06:02,823
Because I'm a suspect?

51
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,690
A subject of an inquiry.

52
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:09,960
An investigation...

53
00:06:09,999 --> 00:06:11,261
into crimes,

54
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:15,100
some of which may not as yet
have been committed.

55
00:06:15,938 --> 00:06:18,736
You think I may commit a crime?

56
00:06:19,675 --> 00:06:21,870
Anyone is capable

57
00:06:21,911 --> 00:06:25,176
given the proper circumstance.

58
00:06:25,214 --> 00:06:27,375
My own mother...

59
00:06:28,884 --> 00:06:31,614
was arrested for shoplifting.

60
00:06:31,654 --> 00:06:33,645
She's an old lady.

61
00:06:35,157 --> 00:06:37,318
I have no criminal record,

62
00:06:37,359 --> 00:06:40,522
no prior arrests either here or at home.

63
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:42,761
Good.

64
00:06:46,702 --> 00:06:48,397
I'd like to see a lawyer,

65
00:06:48,437 --> 00:06:50,064
contact my embassy.

66
00:06:51,841 --> 00:06:52,865
Why?

67
00:06:53,676 --> 00:06:57,806
Because, not knowing the local laws,
I'm afraid...

68
00:06:57,847 --> 00:06:59,576
That you will indict yourself?

69
00:07:00,316 --> 00:07:01,715
No.

70
00:07:03,119 --> 00:07:04,984
I...

71
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:06,385
don't know my rights.

72
00:07:06,422 --> 00:07:08,049
You haven't read me my rights.

73
00:07:10,559 --> 00:07:12,584
That's because...

74
00:07:12,628 --> 00:07:15,961
you are not charged with anything.

75
00:07:17,633 --> 00:07:18,895
Then I can go?

76
00:07:18,934 --> 00:07:20,663
No.

77
00:07:22,571 --> 00:07:25,768
- No.
- I can be held without being charged?

78
00:07:25,808 --> 00:07:26,934
Yes.

79
00:07:26,976 --> 00:07:28,341
For how long?

80
00:07:28,377 --> 00:07:32,177
48 hours. Seven days, six months,
however long it takes.

81
00:07:32,214 --> 00:07:33,647
Takes for what?

82
00:07:33,682 --> 00:07:35,115
You to tell me what I need.

83
00:07:35,151 --> 00:07:37,711
You mean confess?

84
00:07:37,753 --> 00:07:42,349
Confess to a crime that
may or may not have been committed?

85
00:07:42,391 --> 00:07:44,985
That I may have committed
not knowing it was a crime

86
00:07:45,027 --> 00:07:46,824
or that may not even be a crime yet?

87
00:08:13,222 --> 00:08:16,714
The photograph doesn't do you justice,
you're much more handsome.

88
00:08:17,993 --> 00:08:19,984
Or maybe the word is pretty.

89
00:08:20,029 --> 00:08:21,291
Look...

90
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:23,992
You've certainly been to plenty of places.

91
00:08:24,033 --> 00:08:26,365
Russia, Cyprus.

92
00:08:27,436 --> 00:08:28,630
Venezuela.

93
00:08:30,539 --> 00:08:32,973
Israel. You're not Jewish.

94
00:08:35,544 --> 00:08:38,911
Indonesia. Now there's a hotbed of terrorism.

95
00:08:38,948 --> 00:08:40,779
What were you doing there?

96
00:08:40,816 --> 00:08:43,717
- None of your business.
- Sit down.

97
00:08:44,787 --> 00:08:45,947
Please.

98
00:08:51,794 --> 00:08:53,159
Oh.

99
00:08:54,196 --> 00:08:55,527
It's hot in here.

100
00:08:56,532 --> 00:08:58,295
Yes. That time of year.

101
00:09:30,266 --> 00:09:31,631
Sometimes...

102
00:09:31,667 --> 00:09:35,398
the best thing to do is to just sweat.

103
00:10:02,097 --> 00:10:04,088
- What are you doing?
- Easy, man.

104
00:10:04,133 --> 00:10:07,466
I'll break you up. Get down. Stay down.

105
00:10:08,437 --> 00:10:09,426
Aargh!

106
00:10:10,306 --> 00:10:12,638
All right, buddy, let's go.

107
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,070
Head down.

108
00:10:15,811 --> 00:10:16,869
Right. Come on.

109
00:10:16,912 --> 00:10:18,607
Come on.

110
00:10:18,647 --> 00:10:20,137
Move it.

111
00:10:20,182 --> 00:10:21,342
Come on.

112
00:10:21,383 --> 00:10:23,180
- Watch your head.
- Get in.

113
00:10:23,218 --> 00:10:25,152
- Easy.
- Let's go.

114
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:34,759
My government has started
fingerprinting foreigners from certain countries.

115
00:10:35,931 --> 00:10:37,694
But I don't think that's enough.

116
00:10:37,733 --> 00:10:42,136
I think maybe the best solution
is to put ankle bracelets,

117
00:10:42,171 --> 00:10:45,163
monitoring devices, on specific visitors.

118
00:10:45,207 --> 00:10:46,333
Not you.

119
00:10:47,943 --> 00:10:50,275
In order to keep an eye on their movements.

120
00:10:50,312 --> 00:10:51,973
That way...

121
00:10:52,014 --> 00:10:54,744
we know where they go,
who they associate with,

122
00:10:54,783 --> 00:10:56,648
what they're up to.

123
00:10:56,685 --> 00:10:58,516
Anyway, that's what I think.

124
00:10:58,554 --> 00:11:00,385
But who am I?

125
00:11:02,124 --> 00:11:04,854
Just a lowly cog in a rusty wheel.

126
00:11:04,893 --> 00:11:06,258
Ignored.

127
00:11:07,296 --> 00:11:09,093
Unappreciated.

128
00:11:09,865 --> 00:11:10,991
Underpaid.

129
00:11:14,069 --> 00:11:16,469
Can you identify this man?

130
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:20,899
No. Who is he?

131
00:11:22,811 --> 00:11:25,905
I don't know. I was hoping you could tell me.

132
00:11:27,316 --> 00:11:30,717
We think he might be a natural-born citizen,
but we're not sure.

133
00:11:30,753 --> 00:11:34,780
See, that's the problem with my concept
about the ankle bracelets.

134
00:11:34,823 --> 00:11:39,021
One does not have to be a foreigner
to be disloyal.

135
00:11:39,061 --> 00:11:41,996
Disloyal? What do you consider disloyal?

136
00:11:43,298 --> 00:11:46,392
Speaking negatively about our government.

137
00:11:46,435 --> 00:11:48,767
Criticizing our leaders.

138
00:11:48,804 --> 00:11:53,241
That's dissent. There's a difference
between disloyalty and dissent.

139
00:11:54,343 --> 00:11:56,607
I'm sure in your mind...

140
00:11:57,946 --> 00:12:00,073
that's true.

141
00:12:37,486 --> 00:12:38,976
Are you uncomfortable?

142
00:12:40,856 --> 00:12:42,790
I bet you're uncomfortable.

143
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:45,317
Do you promise to behave?

144
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:56,297
How's that?

145
00:12:57,372 --> 00:12:58,669
Better.

146
00:12:59,741 --> 00:13:01,834
I'm a public servant. I'm here to serve.

147
00:13:02,744 --> 00:13:03,972
Why am I here?

148
00:13:04,012 --> 00:13:07,072
Were you hurt
when the officers arrested you?

149
00:13:07,116 --> 00:13:08,378
Arrested?

150
00:13:08,417 --> 00:13:10,351
I told them to be respectful.

151
00:13:11,987 --> 00:13:14,478
Why have I been... arrested?

152
00:13:14,523 --> 00:13:15,820
I...

153
00:13:17,826 --> 00:13:21,023
- I haven't done anything wrong.
- That's a filthy habit.

154
00:13:21,897 --> 00:13:23,364
It's unhealthy.

155
00:13:26,835 --> 00:13:27,824
Listen.

156
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:31,067
I know that I am a foreigner

157
00:13:31,106 --> 00:13:36,544
and as such I may not be aware
of all the laws you people have...

158
00:13:37,746 --> 00:13:40,613
but I can't imagine what crime I've committed.

159
00:13:40,649 --> 00:13:42,776
How long have you been in this country?

160
00:13:42,818 --> 00:13:43,842
A year.

161
00:13:43,886 --> 00:13:45,410
Maybe a little more.

162
00:13:45,454 --> 00:13:49,652
Well, I can see why that may not be
enough time to learn our laws.

163
00:13:49,691 --> 00:13:51,659
Well, not all of them.

164
00:13:51,693 --> 00:13:52,853
No.

165
00:13:53,962 --> 00:13:55,987
The basics.

166
00:13:56,031 --> 00:13:58,727
The ones that are common everywhere.

167
00:13:59,668 --> 00:14:00,999
You know.

168
00:14:01,036 --> 00:14:02,867
Against murder or stealing...

169
00:14:02,905 --> 00:14:08,036
Perhaps I misspoke. You were not arrested.
You've simply been brought in for questioning.

170
00:14:08,076 --> 00:14:09,839
- An interrogation.
- An interview.

171
00:14:10,512 --> 00:14:11,774
Because...

172
00:14:12,748 --> 00:14:13,908
I'm a suspect?

173
00:14:13,949 --> 00:14:15,883
Subject of an inquiry,

174
00:14:15,918 --> 00:14:19,979
an investigation into crimes, some of which
may not as yet have been committed.

175
00:14:20,022 --> 00:14:23,924
Oh, you think I may commit a crime?

176
00:14:23,959 --> 00:14:27,053
Anyone's capable
given the proper circumstances.

177
00:14:27,095 --> 00:14:30,531
My own mother was arrested for shoplifting,
she's an old lady.

178
00:14:30,566 --> 00:14:32,329
I have no criminal record,

179
00:14:32,367 --> 00:14:36,133
no prior arrests or convictions
either here or at home.

180
00:14:36,171 --> 00:14:38,696
- Good.
- I would like to see a lawyer,

181
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:40,207
contact my embassy.

182
00:14:40,242 --> 00:14:41,334
Why?

183
00:14:41,376 --> 00:14:44,903
Because, not knowing the local laws,

184
00:14:44,947 --> 00:14:47,677
- I am afraid that...
- You will indict yourself?

185
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,578
No.

186
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:56,223
I don't know my rights.

187
00:14:56,258 --> 00:14:59,227
You haven't read me my rights.

188
00:15:00,629 --> 00:15:04,030
That's because you aren't charged
with anything.

189
00:15:04,066 --> 00:15:05,363
Then I can go?

190
00:15:06,635 --> 00:15:10,036
- No.
- I can be held without being charged?

191
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:12,973
- Yes.
- For how long?

192
00:15:13,976 --> 00:15:15,637
48 hours.

193
00:15:15,677 --> 00:15:17,542
Seven days.

194
00:15:17,579 --> 00:15:19,206
Six months.

195
00:15:19,248 --> 00:15:21,273
However long it takes.

196
00:15:21,316 --> 00:15:22,806
Takes for what?

197
00:15:22,851 --> 00:15:24,580
You to tell me what I need.

198
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:26,383
You mean confess.

199
00:15:27,556 --> 00:15:33,392
Confess to a crime that may or may not
have been committed.

200
00:15:33,428 --> 00:15:38,627
That I may have committed
not knowing it's a crime or...

201
00:15:38,667 --> 00:15:40,862
that may not even be a crime!

202
00:15:41,837 --> 00:15:42,826
Yet!

203
00:16:12,701 --> 00:16:15,101
Photograph doesn't do you justice.

204
00:16:15,137 --> 00:16:17,002
You're much more handsome.

205
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:21,339
Or maybe the word's...

206
00:16:21,376 --> 00:16:22,468
pretty.

207
00:16:23,245 --> 00:16:24,405
Look...

208
00:16:24,446 --> 00:16:27,643
Ooh. You've been to so many places.

209
00:16:29,117 --> 00:16:30,414
Russia.

210
00:16:31,086 --> 00:16:32,815
Cyprus.

211
00:16:32,854 --> 00:16:34,253
Venezuela.

212
00:16:34,289 --> 00:16:35,813
Israel.

213
00:16:36,725 --> 00:16:38,386
You're not Jewish.

214
00:16:39,394 --> 00:16:41,055
Indonesia.

215
00:16:41,096 --> 00:16:45,556
Now, there's a hotbed of terrorism.
What were you doing there?

216
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,468
It's none of your business.

217
00:16:49,504 --> 00:16:50,869
Sit down.

218
00:16:52,074 --> 00:16:53,666
Please.

219
00:17:03,852 --> 00:17:05,547
- It's hot in here.
- Hm.

220
00:17:05,587 --> 00:17:07,179
Yes.

221
00:17:07,222 --> 00:17:09,087
It's that time of year.

222
00:17:11,593 --> 00:17:14,721
Sometimes the best thing to do is to just...

223
00:17:14,763 --> 00:17:16,253
sweat.

224
00:17:18,066 --> 00:17:21,729
My government has started
fingerprinting foreigners from certain countries,

225
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:23,829
but I'm not sure that's enough.

226
00:17:23,872 --> 00:17:29,071
Maybe the best solution
would be to put ankle bracelets, you know,

227
00:17:29,111 --> 00:17:32,877
monitoring devices, on specific visitors.
I mean, not you.

228
00:17:33,715 --> 00:17:36,548
In order to keep an eye on their movements.

229
00:17:36,585 --> 00:17:38,712
That way we'll know where they go,

230
00:17:38,754 --> 00:17:40,722
who they associate with,

231
00:17:40,756 --> 00:17:42,189
what they're up to.

232
00:17:44,126 --> 00:17:45,821
Anyway...

233
00:17:45,861 --> 00:17:47,795
that's what I think, but...

234
00:17:48,663 --> 00:17:50,221
who am I?

235
00:17:51,466 --> 00:17:55,095
Just a lowly cog in a rusty wheel.

236
00:17:56,204 --> 00:17:58,934
Ignored, unappreciated.

237
00:18:00,642 --> 00:18:02,075
Underpaid.

238
00:18:20,762 --> 00:18:22,662
Can you identify this man?

239
00:18:23,999 --> 00:18:25,591
No. Who is he?

240
00:18:26,768 --> 00:18:28,292
I don't know.

241
00:18:28,336 --> 00:18:30,861
I was hoping you could tell me.

242
00:18:30,906 --> 00:18:35,172
We think he might be a natural-born citizen,
but we're not sure.

243
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:39,078
You see, that's the problem with my concept
about the ankle bracelets,

244
00:18:39,114 --> 00:18:42,675
one does not have to be a foreigner
to be disloyal.

245
00:18:42,717 --> 00:18:44,241
Disloyal?

246
00:18:44,286 --> 00:18:46,754
What do you consider disloyal?

247
00:18:46,788 --> 00:18:49,552
Speaking negatively about our government,

248
00:18:49,591 --> 00:18:51,252
criticizing our leaders.

249
00:18:51,293 --> 00:18:53,158
Well, that's dissent.

250
00:18:54,729 --> 00:18:57,095
There is a difference between...

251
00:18:58,266 --> 00:18:59,858
disloyalty and dissent.

252
00:19:00,769 --> 00:19:03,602
I'm sure in your mind that's true.

253
00:19:04,773 --> 00:19:07,401
- You claim to be a student.
- I am a student.

254
00:19:08,777 --> 00:19:10,540
You seem a little old.

255
00:19:12,013 --> 00:19:13,844
Were you left behind as a child?

256
00:19:14,749 --> 00:19:17,946
No. I'm doing graduate work.
I'm officially registered.

257
00:19:17,986 --> 00:19:21,319
You have the papers, proper documents?

258
00:19:21,356 --> 00:19:22,914
They're...

259
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:26,325
They're back at my apartment.
I could go get them.

260
00:19:27,529 --> 00:19:29,861
You could send someone to go get them.

261
00:19:30,298 --> 00:19:33,028
Uh... What do you study?
What's your major?

262
00:19:33,068 --> 00:19:34,558
Political science.

263
00:19:34,603 --> 00:19:36,662
Oh, ho, ho, ho.

264
00:19:38,507 --> 00:19:39,906
That's funny?

265
00:19:41,476 --> 00:19:44,536
In my experience, politics is no science.

266
00:19:44,579 --> 00:19:47,275
It isn't exact enough.

267
00:19:48,283 --> 00:19:50,478
But I don't mean to editorialize.

268
00:19:50,519 --> 00:19:51,884
Are you a good student?

269
00:19:52,954 --> 00:19:54,717
Are you a good student?

270
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:57,280
Yes.

271
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,357
A "B" in Marxism.

272
00:20:00,395 --> 00:20:05,458
Well, if you have the information in the file,
why do you keep asking me?

273
00:20:07,202 --> 00:20:08,965
Fair enough.

274
00:20:10,906 --> 00:20:16,173
I see that you've studied the teachings
of Mohammed, Buddha and Jesus...

275
00:20:18,213 --> 00:20:20,773
Adam Smith, Chairman Mao.

276
00:20:21,783 --> 00:20:24,183
But what the file doesn't tell me is...

277
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,948
what you believe in,

278
00:20:27,989 --> 00:20:30,549
what ideology, theology, you follow.

279
00:20:32,894 --> 00:20:36,193
Do you believe that your religion
is the only true religion?

280
00:20:36,231 --> 00:20:38,722
That God is on your side?

281
00:20:39,501 --> 00:20:41,594
That all other faiths are false?

282
00:20:41,636 --> 00:20:45,595
That those who follow errant faiths
are doomed to eternal damnation?

283
00:20:46,408 --> 00:20:49,969
That the rest of us should
either be converted or destroyed?

284
00:20:50,011 --> 00:20:51,774
There are...

285
00:20:51,813 --> 00:20:53,542
extremists...

286
00:20:54,516 --> 00:20:56,711
- fanatics, who...
- But not you?

287
00:20:58,219 --> 00:21:01,279
- No.
- So, then, I repeat my question.

288
00:21:03,825 --> 00:21:05,486
What do you believe in?

289
00:21:06,127 --> 00:21:09,460
If not the absolute power of an absolute god,

290
00:21:09,497 --> 00:21:10,589
what?

291
00:21:10,632 --> 00:21:12,998
The individual?

292
00:21:13,034 --> 00:21:15,730
The ability of the human mind,

293
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:17,704
the ability of the mind to...

294
00:21:17,739 --> 00:21:19,263
to make a choice?

295
00:21:19,307 --> 00:21:22,970
The ability of the mind to make a choice?

296
00:21:23,011 --> 00:21:24,740
Democracy?

297
00:21:24,779 --> 00:21:26,679
Pure democracy, yes.

298
00:21:31,987 --> 00:21:36,447
But they certainly don't have pure democracy
in your country, do they?

299
00:21:40,862 --> 00:21:42,796
May I have a glass of water?

300
00:21:42,831 --> 00:21:43,855
Of course.

301
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,695
Democracy...

302
00:21:47,736 --> 00:21:50,261
mean different things

303
00:21:50,305 --> 00:21:52,398
to different people,

304
00:21:52,874 --> 00:21:56,366
as does freedom, peace,

305
00:21:56,411 --> 00:21:57,708
tolerance...

306
00:21:59,147 --> 00:22:00,546
justice.

307
00:22:01,683 --> 00:22:05,346
And if you look at history,
any country's history,

308
00:22:05,387 --> 00:22:08,220
in order to achieve these ideals,

309
00:22:08,256 --> 00:22:12,352
there must first be revolution,

310
00:22:12,394 --> 00:22:13,383
uprising...

311
00:22:13,428 --> 00:22:15,089
Lenin.

312
00:22:15,997 --> 00:22:19,364
Ben-Gurion. Mandela.

313
00:22:19,401 --> 00:22:20,800
George Washington.

314
00:22:23,104 --> 00:22:25,834
He crossed the Delaware at midnight.

315
00:22:27,175 --> 00:22:30,042
A sneak attack on Christmas Eve.

316
00:22:32,714 --> 00:22:35,308
By today's standard,

317
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:38,683
I guess he'd be considered a terrorist.

318
00:22:39,287 --> 00:22:43,951
So you can see
why I understand your actions.

319
00:22:43,992 --> 00:22:47,257
Which actions?
What exactly am I accused of?

320
00:22:48,029 --> 00:22:49,997
- Can you identify this man?
- No!

321
00:22:50,031 --> 00:22:51,521
No.

322
00:22:51,566 --> 00:22:53,397
May I call my family?

323
00:22:53,435 --> 00:22:56,563
I'm supposed to phone my mother about now.
She'll worry.

324
00:22:56,604 --> 00:22:58,731
Your mother knows exactly where you are.

325
00:23:00,742 --> 00:23:02,937
- She does?
- Or will shortly.

326
00:23:02,977 --> 00:23:05,571
We live in a new age, if you will,

327
00:23:05,613 --> 00:23:09,572
where law enforcement agencies all over
the planet are coordinating their efforts,

328
00:23:09,617 --> 00:23:11,016
exchanging information.

329
00:23:11,052 --> 00:23:13,612
- About me? I'm nobody.
- You're wrong.

330
00:23:23,264 --> 00:23:25,630
- All we've got is 24 hours.
- Yeah, yeah.

331
00:23:27,235 --> 00:23:28,862
I understand.

332
00:23:34,409 --> 00:23:35,398
Hello?

333
00:23:36,311 --> 00:23:37,300
Hello.

334
00:23:48,156 --> 00:23:51,717
- Is this your handwriting?
- You broke into my room,

335
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,955
rifled through my belongings,

336
00:23:53,995 --> 00:23:55,428
and stole my papers?

337
00:23:55,463 --> 00:23:56,725
We had a warrant.

338
00:23:56,765 --> 00:23:59,598
Granted by some very patriotic judge,
I'm sure.

339
00:23:59,634 --> 00:24:01,659
Is this your handwriting?

340
00:24:03,104 --> 00:24:04,901
- Yes.
- So you wrote this?

341
00:24:04,939 --> 00:24:06,270
Yes.

342
00:24:07,842 --> 00:24:10,777
"The tree of liberty must be refreshed
from time to time

343
00:24:10,812 --> 00:24:12,973
"with the blood of patriots and tyrants."

344
00:24:13,014 --> 00:24:16,279
That's a quote from Thomas Jefferson.
It's for my thesis.

345
00:24:16,317 --> 00:24:19,753
You say it's a thesis,
I say this document advocates treason.

346
00:24:19,788 --> 00:24:21,949
It's only words on a piece of paper.

347
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:24,754
You know that words
are as dangerous as any bomb.

348
00:24:24,793 --> 00:24:26,784
Words in the wrong hands can be misused.

349
00:24:26,828 --> 00:24:29,763
What's the saying?
"Even the devil can quote the Bible."

350
00:24:29,798 --> 00:24:33,894
All I was trying to say
is that every single one of us

351
00:24:33,935 --> 00:24:36,460
has a mandate to do what's right.

352
00:24:36,504 --> 00:24:38,938
Ah, to do what's right.

353
00:24:38,973 --> 00:24:40,804
And what is right?

354
00:24:40,842 --> 00:24:44,073
Each person must decide that
for him or herself.

355
00:24:44,112 --> 00:24:46,012
Is that treason?

356
00:24:46,047 --> 00:24:47,036
Perhaps.

357
00:24:47,081 --> 00:24:50,107
All I was trying to say is

358
00:24:50,151 --> 00:24:52,483
that every single one of us

359
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,750
has a mandate to do what is right.

360
00:24:54,789 --> 00:24:56,347
Ah.

361
00:24:56,391 --> 00:24:58,484
To do what's right? And what is right?

362
00:24:58,526 --> 00:25:02,257
Well, each person must decide that
for him or herself.

363
00:25:02,297 --> 00:25:03,423
Is that treason?

364
00:25:03,464 --> 00:25:04,863
Perhaps.

365
00:25:04,899 --> 00:25:06,799
From October 7th...

366
00:25:08,136 --> 00:25:10,604
to November 10th,

367
00:25:10,638 --> 00:25:14,768
you exchanged 16 phone calls
with someone we'll call x.

368
00:25:14,809 --> 00:25:16,470
You tapped my phone?

369
00:25:16,511 --> 00:25:20,948
X has made numerous inflammatory
anti-government statements,

370
00:25:20,982 --> 00:25:24,679
including a threat to blow up
several buildings in this area,

371
00:25:24,719 --> 00:25:26,619
the bridges, the reservoir.

372
00:25:26,654 --> 00:25:29,953
People in anger say stupid things,

373
00:25:29,991 --> 00:25:34,325
people who think that their conversations
are private, who are talking to friends.

374
00:25:34,362 --> 00:25:36,853
- So x is your friend?
- I don't know.

375
00:25:36,898 --> 00:25:39,230
We may be talking about two different x.

376
00:25:39,267 --> 00:25:43,294
- On November 10th you attended a meeting.
- I went to a dinner at the center.

377
00:25:43,338 --> 00:25:44,362
You talked about?

378
00:25:44,405 --> 00:25:46,600
- Politics.
- People expressed opinions.

379
00:25:46,641 --> 00:25:49,667
That's usually what happens
when people talk politics, you know.

380
00:25:49,711 --> 00:25:53,909
But I have to tell you, I think it's funny
that you suspect our little group

381
00:25:53,948 --> 00:25:56,246
of some deep, dark conspiracy.

382
00:25:56,985 --> 00:26:00,853
We get together after class
and fool around and drink.

383
00:26:00,889 --> 00:26:04,484
Mostly we drink.
And you guys have been monitoring us?

384
00:26:04,525 --> 00:26:08,017
We don't need a reason
to monitor a group or club.

385
00:26:08,062 --> 00:26:10,792
We don't need to suspect anyone of anything
to follow them.

386
00:26:10,832 --> 00:26:15,929
What else have you done?
Got in our bank records, emails?

387
00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:17,562
Long-distance bills?

388
00:26:17,605 --> 00:26:18,697
Yes.

389
00:26:20,975 --> 00:26:25,935
Well, you must feel really disappointed,
going to all that effort monitoring us.

390
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:29,916
On the contrary, our work bore fruit,
we have a witness...

391
00:26:29,951 --> 00:26:34,445
...who says that you were criticizing
certain policies, advocating violence.

392
00:26:34,489 --> 00:26:36,957
Show me this witness!

393
00:26:36,991 --> 00:26:40,324
Let him step forward and accuse me
face to face.

394
00:26:40,361 --> 00:26:41,419
The witness is a she.

395
00:26:41,963 --> 00:26:44,261
The witness is a she.

396
00:26:45,266 --> 00:26:48,258
And... we don't handle things that way.

397
00:26:48,303 --> 00:26:50,464
If you won't let me talk to a lawyer,

398
00:26:50,505 --> 00:26:54,271
if you won't let me confront this

399
00:26:54,309 --> 00:26:57,073
so-called witness...

400
00:26:58,446 --> 00:27:00,311
how can I defend myself?

401
00:27:00,348 --> 00:27:03,283
Simple. By speaking the truth.

402
00:27:03,318 --> 00:27:05,149
I have told the truth.

403
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:07,349
No! You haven't!

404
00:27:07,388 --> 00:27:08,616
You're lying!

405
00:27:08,656 --> 00:27:10,248
I'm not!

406
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:13,020
You're a liar.

407
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,548
You really believe this girl
is part of a terrorist cell?

408
00:27:34,582 --> 00:27:40,350
We believe that she has associated with
certain individuals who are potential terrorists.

409
00:27:40,388 --> 00:27:43,482
Whether she herself is a terrorist,
who knows?

410
00:27:43,524 --> 00:27:47,221
Look, I'm getting a lot of heat
from the ambassador, from home,

411
00:27:47,261 --> 00:27:49,229
I've got to tell them something.

412
00:27:49,263 --> 00:27:51,060
When can I say she'll be released?

413
00:27:51,099 --> 00:27:53,863
Depending on how cooperative she is,

414
00:27:53,901 --> 00:27:58,304
we'll either start deportation proceedings
by the end of the week or put her to trial.

415
00:27:59,207 --> 00:28:01,698
Assure me that she'll have access
to a lawyer.

416
00:28:01,743 --> 00:28:06,077
No problem. We've found
lawyer/client meetings to be very informative.

417
00:28:06,114 --> 00:28:11,108
That is unless it's decided
she goes before a tribunal, then all bets are off.

418
00:28:11,152 --> 00:28:12,915
No lawyer, no jury.

419
00:28:20,495 --> 00:28:23,430
- Lieutenant. You know Mr. Hudson.
- Yes.

420
00:28:23,464 --> 00:28:28,663
He wants an estimate as to when
you will have finished with Sykes.

421
00:28:28,703 --> 00:28:31,103
- By noon.
- Are you causing her any physical harm?

422
00:28:31,773 --> 00:28:35,709
You Americans want our government
to help you,

423
00:28:35,743 --> 00:28:38,871
feed you information,
but you get nervous with our methods.

424
00:28:39,847 --> 00:28:41,212
Do I look nervous?

425
00:28:43,985 --> 00:28:46,146
I just don't want to be surprised
by any bruises.

426
00:28:46,187 --> 00:28:48,178
- Don't worry.
- Did you bring the file?

427
00:28:53,661 --> 00:28:56,755
This is everything we could get
on such short notice.

428
00:28:57,932 --> 00:28:59,194
Thank you.

429
00:29:00,668 --> 00:29:01,999
Back to work.

430
00:29:02,904 --> 00:29:04,371
You are welcome to wait.

431
00:29:04,405 --> 00:29:06,100
For what?

432
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:08,074
I don't even know she's here.

433
00:29:10,711 --> 00:29:13,703
You really believe
this boy is part of a terrorist cell?

434
00:29:13,748 --> 00:29:16,376
There's been an increase in chatter
the past few weeks.

435
00:29:16,417 --> 00:29:19,352
Our intelligence tells us
something is about to happen.

436
00:29:19,387 --> 00:29:22,049
We believe Sharif
can lead us to the perpetrators.

437
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:24,615
Whether he himself is a terrorist,
who knows?

438
00:29:25,259 --> 00:29:28,353
Look, I'm getting a lot of heat
from the ambassador, from home,

439
00:29:28,396 --> 00:29:31,661
I have to tell them something.
When can I say he'll be released?

440
00:29:31,699 --> 00:29:33,633
Depending on how cooperative he is,

441
00:29:33,668 --> 00:29:37,468
we'll start deportation by the end of the week
or put him on trial.

442
00:29:37,505 --> 00:29:39,735
Assure me he'll have access to a lawyer.

443
00:29:39,774 --> 00:29:43,608
No problem. We find the lawyer/client meetings
to be very informative.

444
00:29:43,644 --> 00:29:47,705
That is unless it's decided
he'll go before a tribunal, then all bets are off.

445
00:29:47,748 --> 00:29:49,613
No lawyer, no jury.

446
00:29:50,585 --> 00:29:53,383
- May I see him?
- That isn't advisable at this time.

447
00:29:53,421 --> 00:29:55,150
Did you bring the file?

448
00:29:56,357 --> 00:29:59,155
This is everything we could get

449
00:29:59,193 --> 00:30:01,286
on such short notice.

450
00:30:01,329 --> 00:30:02,626
Ah, thank you.

451
00:30:03,931 --> 00:30:05,023
Oh.

452
00:30:05,066 --> 00:30:06,294
Back to work.

453
00:30:06,334 --> 00:30:07,596
You're welcome to wait.

454
00:30:07,635 --> 00:30:08,727
For what?

455
00:30:09,804 --> 00:30:12,034
I don't even know that he's here.

456
00:30:25,953 --> 00:30:28,444
- Take off your clothes.
- What?

457
00:30:28,489 --> 00:30:31,356
- Your clothes. Take them off.
- Why?

458
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:35,151
Because I'm going to do a strip search.

459
00:30:35,196 --> 00:30:37,130
- Strip...
- Full cavity.

460
00:30:37,165 --> 00:30:38,496
But why?

461
00:30:39,567 --> 00:30:41,364
Because it's what we do.

462
00:30:42,336 --> 00:30:43,997
It's part of the procedure.

463
00:30:44,038 --> 00:30:47,132
I thought searches were done by people...

464
00:30:47,175 --> 00:30:48,540
of the same sex.

465
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:54,276
Well, usually they are,
but there are occasional exceptions like this.

466
00:30:54,315 --> 00:30:56,180
Take off your clothes.

467
00:31:04,659 --> 00:31:06,286
Take off your clothes.

468
00:31:07,328 --> 00:31:09,990
- What?
- Your clothes. Take them off.

469
00:31:11,098 --> 00:31:12,156
Why?

470
00:31:13,601 --> 00:31:15,569
Because I'm going to do a strip search.

471
00:31:15,603 --> 00:31:17,434
- A strip...
- Full cavity.

472
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:20,100
But why?

473
00:31:22,076 --> 00:31:25,944
Because that's what we do.
It's part of the procedure.

474
00:31:27,548 --> 00:31:28,913
I thought...

475
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:31,783
searches were done
by people of the same sex.

476
00:31:32,453 --> 00:31:36,651
Usually that's true, but there are
occasional exceptions like this.

477
00:31:37,825 --> 00:31:39,816
Take off your clothes.

478
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:41,293
What if I say no?

479
00:31:41,963 --> 00:31:43,931
- Say no?
- Well, I don't want to.

480
00:31:43,965 --> 00:31:45,956
Look at the situation from my side.

481
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,969
I can't take the chance
of releasing the wrong person.

482
00:31:49,003 --> 00:31:51,563
I cannot give you the benefit of the doubt.

483
00:31:51,606 --> 00:31:53,437
I can't give you the benefit of the doubt.

484
00:31:53,474 --> 00:31:56,170
I demand to see somebody
from my embassy.

485
00:31:56,210 --> 00:31:58,405
Why? Why not cooperate?

486
00:31:58,446 --> 00:32:00,471
- Have you got something to hide?
- No.

487
00:32:00,514 --> 00:32:05,816
Is it your body that you're embarrassed about,
something smaller than it ought to be?

488
00:32:10,992 --> 00:32:13,324
There we go.
Thank you for the cooperation.

489
00:32:13,361 --> 00:32:15,261
Do you have something to hide?

490
00:32:15,296 --> 00:32:16,285
No.

491
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:20,824
Is there a part of your body
you're embarrassed about, something...

492
00:32:20,868 --> 00:32:22,335
smaller than it ought to be?

493
00:32:29,043 --> 00:32:30,374
There we go.

494
00:32:32,313 --> 00:32:33,974
Thank you for your cooperation.

495
00:32:48,529 --> 00:32:50,190
Uh, uh.

496
00:32:51,065 --> 00:32:52,362
Hm.

497
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,833
You work out.

498
00:32:55,603 --> 00:32:57,434
You have a good solid body.

499
00:32:59,707 --> 00:33:02,039
So I figure maybe you go to the gym.

500
00:33:10,351 --> 00:33:11,875
Pants.

501
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:24,127
Sexy.

502
00:33:24,165 --> 00:33:25,632
Take them off.

503
00:33:34,075 --> 00:33:35,838
Yes. A good solid body.

504
00:33:37,645 --> 00:33:39,579
And by solid I don't mean fat.

505
00:33:39,613 --> 00:33:41,672
You are not fat.

506
00:33:42,717 --> 00:33:46,915
We can all afford
to lose a few pounds, of course.

507
00:33:47,955 --> 00:33:49,718
But you're not even close to fat.

508
00:34:17,985 --> 00:34:19,213
Sexy.

509
00:34:19,854 --> 00:34:21,651
Take them off.

510
00:34:35,469 --> 00:34:38,802
Yes. You've got a good solid body.

511
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:41,970
By solid I do not mean fat.

512
00:34:43,377 --> 00:34:45,242
You are not fat.

513
00:34:45,279 --> 00:34:50,808
We can all afford to lose a few pounds,
of course, but you're not even close to fat.

514
00:34:54,188 --> 00:34:57,055
Did you know that the al-Qaeda
in their training manual

515
00:34:57,091 --> 00:35:02,825
suggest that martyrs for Allah shave off
all of their body hair before they die?

516
00:35:04,365 --> 00:35:05,696
Why?

517
00:35:07,568 --> 00:35:09,195
For what purpose?

518
00:35:10,971 --> 00:35:12,939
I ask you, why?

519
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:18,271
I don't know anything about al-Qaeda.

520
00:35:18,312 --> 00:35:21,281
I'm not saying that you do.

521
00:35:24,885 --> 00:35:26,750
- Open your mouth.
- My mouth?

522
00:35:27,688 --> 00:35:28,677
Wide.

523
00:35:28,722 --> 00:35:30,280
Aah.

524
00:35:30,324 --> 00:35:31,723
Like at the dentist.

525
00:35:31,759 --> 00:35:35,627
I mean, you do go to the dentist, don't you?

526
00:35:36,297 --> 00:35:37,696
Wider.

527
00:35:38,799 --> 00:35:40,323
Come on, help me out.

528
00:35:40,367 --> 00:35:42,528
My mouth doesn't go any wider.

529
00:35:42,570 --> 00:35:45,539
Open like during oral sex.

530
00:35:52,246 --> 00:35:54,339
You know they call this a cavity search,

531
00:35:54,381 --> 00:35:57,316
cavity meaning every orifice in the body.

532
00:35:58,519 --> 00:36:04,480
But you'd be surprised the number of times
I actually find a cavity in someone's teeth.

533
00:36:05,526 --> 00:36:06,754
But not you.

534
00:36:07,695 --> 00:36:10,858
Yours are in tiptop condition.

535
00:36:12,099 --> 00:36:15,000
There. That wasn't so bad, was it?

536
00:36:19,573 --> 00:36:21,165
Ever been married?

537
00:36:22,243 --> 00:36:23,574
No.

538
00:36:27,915 --> 00:36:29,109
You...

539
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:31,549
like girls,

540
00:36:32,653 --> 00:36:34,177
don't you?

541
00:36:36,824 --> 00:36:38,018
Yes.

542
00:36:39,026 --> 00:36:41,688
So if I touch you down there...

543
00:36:44,965 --> 00:36:47,331
what do you think your reaction will be?

544
00:36:47,968 --> 00:36:49,026
Don't.

545
00:36:49,069 --> 00:36:50,297
Don't?

546
00:36:54,208 --> 00:36:55,368
Please.

547
00:36:57,511 --> 00:36:58,671
Don't.

548
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:01,704
Ever been married?

549
00:37:02,650 --> 00:37:04,345
No.

550
00:37:04,385 --> 00:37:06,285
You like girls, don't you?

551
00:37:07,521 --> 00:37:09,546
Yes.

552
00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:13,219
So if I touch you down there,
what do you think your reaction will be?

553
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:14,352
Don't.

554
00:37:14,395 --> 00:37:15,487
Oh.

555
00:37:15,529 --> 00:37:17,520
Don't. Did you say don't?

556
00:37:20,701 --> 00:37:22,191
Please don't.

557
00:37:24,471 --> 00:37:25,802
Ah.

558
00:37:27,341 --> 00:37:29,605
That was sweet. Er...

559
00:37:29,643 --> 00:37:31,634
What's the word?

560
00:37:31,679 --> 00:37:32,805
Plaintive.

561
00:37:34,148 --> 00:37:37,117
That's what happens to people
who end up in here.

562
00:37:37,151 --> 00:37:41,110
Outside these walls they're tough,
they've got an attitude.

563
00:37:41,989 --> 00:37:44,981
But once that door shuts, they crumble.

564
00:37:45,025 --> 00:37:46,583
They turn into little girls.

565
00:37:48,128 --> 00:37:50,824
That's what you remind me of now.

566
00:37:52,466 --> 00:37:54,991
A frightened little girl.

567
00:37:56,270 --> 00:37:57,294
Stop.

568
00:37:57,338 --> 00:37:59,431
That a sensitive area for you?

569
00:38:01,141 --> 00:38:03,075
I don't like being touched.

570
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:05,374
- Being touched there or anywhere?
- Stop!

571
00:38:05,412 --> 00:38:07,175
Careful! You don't want to hit me!

572
00:38:07,915 --> 00:38:09,940
That's what you remind me of right now,

573
00:38:09,984 --> 00:38:12,009
a frightened little girl.

574
00:38:12,052 --> 00:38:13,451
Stop.

575
00:38:13,487 --> 00:38:16,422
- I don't... Stop!
- Is that a sensitive area for you?

576
00:38:16,457 --> 00:38:20,553
- I don't like people touching me.
- Touching you there or anywhere?

577
00:38:20,594 --> 00:38:21,891
Stop!

578
00:38:21,929 --> 00:38:26,389
Careful. You don't want to hit me.
The consequences would be dire.

579
00:38:26,433 --> 00:38:28,094
Aargh! Aargh!

580
00:38:33,507 --> 00:38:34,531
Oh.

581
00:38:35,809 --> 00:38:37,640
Tell me about your girlfriend.

582
00:38:40,014 --> 00:38:41,811
I didn't say I had a girlfriend.

583
00:38:42,549 --> 00:38:45,484
There are references to her in your emails.

584
00:38:49,723 --> 00:38:52,283
Is there any part of my life
you haven't picked through?

585
00:38:53,727 --> 00:38:56,321
Was she the great love of your life?

586
00:39:03,804 --> 00:39:05,294
Why did she leave?

587
00:39:07,041 --> 00:39:10,568
There is nothing in my emails
about her leaving.

588
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:14,545
How do you know she left?

589
00:39:19,353 --> 00:39:21,218
I can see the pain in your eyes.

590
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,352
Why did she walk out on you?

591
00:39:28,395 --> 00:39:31,330
I don't know. Why does anybody walk out?

592
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:48,241
Look familiar?

593
00:39:54,755 --> 00:39:55,915
That's her.

594
00:39:56,957 --> 00:39:58,117
Yes.

595
00:39:58,826 --> 00:40:00,350
Gorgeous.

596
00:40:03,831 --> 00:40:05,389
By the way,

597
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:07,690
she's our witness.

598
00:40:07,735 --> 00:40:10,135
She's going to testify against you.

599
00:40:12,072 --> 00:40:13,266
No.

600
00:40:14,475 --> 00:40:15,874
She wouldn't.

601
00:40:23,050 --> 00:40:24,642
She wouldn't do that.

602
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,686
Settle down.

603
00:41:18,705 --> 00:41:20,696
So why did she walk out on you?

604
00:41:25,045 --> 00:41:26,444
I don't know.

605
00:41:27,714 --> 00:41:29,682
Why does anybody walk out?

606
00:41:34,388 --> 00:41:36,447
Look familiar?

607
00:41:39,993 --> 00:41:41,858
- That's her.
- Yes.

608
00:41:41,895 --> 00:41:43,294
Gorgeous.

609
00:41:44,898 --> 00:41:46,593
By the way,

610
00:41:46,633 --> 00:41:48,567
she's our witness.

611
00:41:48,602 --> 00:41:50,661
She's gonna testify against you.

612
00:41:50,704 --> 00:41:51,796
No!

613
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:53,329
She wouldn't.

614
00:41:54,975 --> 00:41:57,535
- She wouldn't do that!
- Settle down.

615
00:42:05,853 --> 00:42:07,844
We found these photos

616
00:42:07,888 --> 00:42:09,651
in your apartment.

617
00:42:09,690 --> 00:42:11,419
Airports, bridges.

618
00:42:12,426 --> 00:42:13,859
A tunnel.

619
00:42:13,894 --> 00:42:15,020
Dam.

620
00:42:16,129 --> 00:42:18,996
I'm a tourist. I photograph things.

621
00:42:19,032 --> 00:42:21,830
If you looked, you also saw...

622
00:42:23,303 --> 00:42:26,363
mountains, sunsets, children playing.

623
00:42:27,241 --> 00:42:30,267
A week ago, you rented a car.

624
00:42:30,310 --> 00:42:34,269
Ah, no, I just signed the forms for a friend.

625
00:42:36,250 --> 00:42:39,777
We found trace elements of TNT
in the trunk of that car.

626
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:42,084
- What?
- Granted they're only molecules,

627
00:42:42,122 --> 00:42:46,183
but why was there TNT
in the trunk of the car you rented?

628
00:42:46,226 --> 00:42:49,593
I told you, I didn't rent the car for myself.

629
00:42:49,630 --> 00:42:52,224
A friend asked me as a favor.

630
00:42:52,266 --> 00:42:53,756
Which friend? What's the name?

631
00:42:54,501 --> 00:42:59,302
I'm not gonna tell you.
I'm not guilty of anything and neither is he.

632
00:42:59,339 --> 00:43:01,864
You harbored a terrorist.

633
00:43:01,909 --> 00:43:03,536
- No.
- You financed a terrorist.

634
00:43:03,577 --> 00:43:07,445
- No!
- You aided and abetted a terrorist.

635
00:43:07,481 --> 00:43:07,947
No!

636
00:43:08,815 --> 00:43:12,546
Would you still say that
if you were attached to a lie detector?

637
00:43:12,586 --> 00:43:15,646
- Yes.
- And you'd answer every question?

638
00:43:15,689 --> 00:43:17,714
- Yes.
- What if I gave you truth serum?

639
00:43:17,758 --> 00:43:20,318
- Truth serum?
- Inject you with truth serum.

640
00:43:22,229 --> 00:43:24,129
OK. Go ahead.

641
00:43:24,164 --> 00:43:27,292
We believe your friend x
is involved in terrorist activities.

642
00:43:27,334 --> 00:43:29,495
- You're wrong.
- Why would you protect him?

643
00:43:29,536 --> 00:43:33,734
Why would a decent person protect someone
who's planning the deaths of innocent people?

644
00:43:33,774 --> 00:43:36,504
- He's not...
- I'm what you might call old school.

645
00:43:36,543 --> 00:43:41,173
To stop crime, you threaten criminals with
physical punishment, imprisonment, death.

646
00:43:41,214 --> 00:43:46,846
But these suicide bombers, they've already
chosen to die, they're not afraid of prosecution.

647
00:43:46,887 --> 00:43:50,323
So we have to stop them before they act,
we have to keep them alive.

648
00:43:50,357 --> 00:43:52,689
That's their punishment.

649
00:43:52,726 --> 00:43:55,490
Make the bastards wish they were dead.

650
00:43:55,529 --> 00:43:57,793
Humiliate them.

651
00:43:57,831 --> 00:44:01,323
Or make them aware that if they die in here,

652
00:44:01,368 --> 00:44:02,801
alone,

653
00:44:02,836 --> 00:44:06,567
that their deaths will have no meaning,

654
00:44:06,606 --> 00:44:08,471
no resonance,

655
00:44:08,508 --> 00:44:12,410
no effect on anyone whatsoever.

656
00:44:23,223 --> 00:44:25,282
Turn around.

657
00:44:25,325 --> 00:44:27,156
Put your hands on the wall.

658
00:44:29,162 --> 00:44:30,493
Palms flat.

659
00:44:37,204 --> 00:44:38,637
Spread your legs.

660
00:44:42,275 --> 00:44:43,367
Turn around.

661
00:44:45,278 --> 00:44:47,678
Put your hands against the wall.

662
00:44:47,714 --> 00:44:49,079
Palms flat.

663
00:44:49,116 --> 00:44:50,583
Spread your legs.

664
00:45:18,178 --> 00:45:21,443
I have to tell you this is my least favorite part.

665
00:45:24,317 --> 00:45:28,151
I took the test,
went through the academy, for what?

666
00:45:28,188 --> 00:45:31,180
Thought I'd be out in the field,
doing good, saving lives.

667
00:45:31,224 --> 00:45:35,422
Instead I spend my days
with my hand up other people's asses.

668
00:45:35,462 --> 00:45:38,260
Might as well have gone to medical school.

669
00:45:39,466 --> 00:45:41,525
Become a gynecologist.

670
00:45:41,568 --> 00:45:44,196
Or a... What's the word for a colon specialist?

671
00:45:44,237 --> 00:45:46,432
Stop talking and just do it.

672
00:45:46,473 --> 00:45:48,134
What? I didn't hear you.

673
00:45:49,209 --> 00:45:54,272
You heard me.
I know what you're up to. I'm not an idiot.

674
00:45:54,314 --> 00:45:56,441
So do whatever you want.

675
00:45:56,483 --> 00:46:00,715
I'm gonna stare at this wall,
I'm gonna focus on this wall,

676
00:46:00,754 --> 00:46:02,244
memorize this wall.

677
00:46:02,289 --> 00:46:04,883
I will own this wall.

678
00:46:04,925 --> 00:46:07,120
What you should be focusing on...

679
00:46:11,231 --> 00:46:12,926
...is the children.

680
00:46:15,202 --> 00:46:16,601
Orphaned children.

681
00:46:17,671 --> 00:46:19,662
Traumatized children.

682
00:46:21,475 --> 00:46:24,205
You see, unlike you, I have a child, a boy.

683
00:46:25,512 --> 00:46:28,572
I want him to live in a world that's safe.

684
00:46:28,615 --> 00:46:31,516
Where he feels safe.

685
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:36,147
I want him...

686
00:46:36,189 --> 00:46:37,986
to live...

687
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:42,522
in a world that's safe,

688
00:46:42,562 --> 00:46:44,052
where he feels safe.

689
00:46:48,768 --> 00:46:53,205
Doing this, what kind of role model are you,

690
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:56,607
what kind of legacy
are you handing down to him?

691
00:46:56,643 --> 00:46:58,201
Safe...

692
00:46:58,245 --> 00:47:00,509
but not free.

693
00:47:00,547 --> 00:47:02,879
Alive but not human.

694
00:47:12,893 --> 00:47:17,125
It is not my fault
that we don't live in a perfect world.

695
00:47:18,465 --> 00:47:22,128
It's not my fault
that we don't live in a perfect world.

696
00:47:53,767 --> 00:47:56,395
I'm going to do this every day, all day...

697
00:47:59,539 --> 00:48:02,007
until it becomes as natural as breathing,

698
00:48:02,042 --> 00:48:04,567
you will come to need it like air.

699
00:48:06,613 --> 00:48:10,413
And the best part is
I didn't have to touch you.

700
00:48:23,863 --> 00:48:26,058
So let me ask you again...

701
00:48:27,968 --> 00:48:29,731
do you know these men?

702
00:48:33,907 --> 00:48:38,337
Do you?

703
00:48:50,357 --> 00:48:51,790
OK.

704
00:48:51,825 --> 00:48:53,986
That's it.

705
00:48:54,027 --> 00:48:56,018
Someone else will be in to talk to you.

706
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:09,664
We're going to do this every day,

707
00:50:09,703 --> 00:50:11,637
all day...

708
00:50:12,806 --> 00:50:16,071
until it becomes as natural as breathing.

709
00:50:18,078 --> 00:50:19,238
Yes.

710
00:50:20,246 --> 00:50:23,579
You will come to need it...

711
00:50:23,616 --> 00:50:25,413
like air.

712
00:50:27,587 --> 00:50:29,145
The best part is...

713
00:50:30,423 --> 00:50:33,187
I didn't have to touch you.

714
00:50:39,232 --> 00:50:41,996
So... let me ask you again...

715
00:50:42,802 --> 00:50:44,269
do you know these men?

716
00:50:46,272 --> 00:50:47,330
Do you?

717
00:51:05,158 --> 00:51:06,819
Yeah.

718
00:51:06,860 --> 00:51:07,849
OK.

719
00:51:12,499 --> 00:51:13,761
That's it.

720
00:51:19,906 --> 00:51:21,874
Someone else will be in to talk to you.

721
00:51:52,439 --> 00:51:53,428
Ah.

722
00:53:09,182 --> 00:53:12,276
Say, theoretically,
that the government of the United States

723
00:53:12,318 --> 00:53:15,913
could rid the world of terrorism forever...

724
00:53:19,392 --> 00:53:23,852
but only if for a single day you gave up
all your rights as an American citizen.

725
00:53:25,298 --> 00:53:26,424
Would you do it?

726
00:53:31,137 --> 00:53:33,503
Would you give up your rights for a week?

727
00:53:40,013 --> 00:53:41,605
A month?

728
00:53:48,855 --> 00:53:50,220
A year?

729
00:53:52,325 --> 00:53:53,656
Ten years?

730
00:53:55,461 --> 00:53:56,792
Forever?
