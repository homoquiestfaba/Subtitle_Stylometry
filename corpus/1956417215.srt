1
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,320
Dallal!

2
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,200
Dallal, what's going on here?
What are you doing?

3
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,230
Testing the combat techniques

4
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:42,025
that you and your military colleagues
so kindly shared with us.

5
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:43,891
You should very feel proud of this.

6
00:02:43,991 --> 00:02:45,430
This is the village of Gardena.

7
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:48,670
Anything that helps to hurt Kohmeni
is good for the Americans.

8
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,760
From your lips.

9
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,430
I wasn't sent here by the US government

10
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,190
to help you annihilate
the innocent people.

11
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:57,458
They're not innocent people.
We don't annihilate innocent people.

12
00:02:57,558 --> 00:02:59,590
They collaborate with Kohmeni,
we're teaching them a lesson.

13
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,710
This is not your problem, Douglass,
this is my problem.

14
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,416
What the hell are you taking about?

15
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:05,660
You murdered innocent people here.

16
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,303
One more word out of you

17
00:03:07,403 --> 00:03:09,440
and I will turn you
in for insubordination.

18
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,040
No!

19
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,840
No!

20
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,480
Leave him alone!

21
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,983
How dare you challenge my authority.

22
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,923
Don't kill him. I want him alive.

23
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:21,070
Here at Baghdad International Airport,

24
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:23,889
the first foreign nationalists
have evacuated from Kuwait

25
00:05:23,989 --> 00:05:26,280
are now finally being allowed
to be in the country.

26
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,368
Hang in there, OK?

27
00:05:28,468 --> 00:05:31,068
We're almost out of here
just a few more minutes.

28
00:05:31,168 --> 00:05:33,920
OK. All right here we go. I know.

29
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,520
Thank you.

30
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:56,077
Wait, wait a minute. What's going on?
I'm an American citizen.

31
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,680
Bastard, they're taking away an American.

32
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:01,102
Get that on tape.

33
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,550
Answer my question.

34
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,670
I've done nothing wrong here,
my papers are all in order.

35
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,241
What is going on here?

36
00:06:07,341 --> 00:06:10,630
Do you understand what I am saying?
I am an American citizen.

37
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,390
American Embassy, what's going on here?

38
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,925
They're taking my husband. My husband!

39
00:06:15,025 --> 00:06:17,191
I demand to know
why you're detaining this man.

40
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,360
-I'm from the American Embassy.
-This is not your business.

41
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,369
Stop them!

42
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:28,870
My husband Ben! Oh, my God!

43
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,020
Laura, don't worry,
it's going to be all right.

44
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,238
Here's my husbands medicine,
he's a diabetic, he'll die without it.

45
00:06:34,338 --> 00:06:36,033
Laura, don't worry.
It's going to be all right.

46
00:06:36,133 --> 00:06:38,369
-Everything's going to be all right.
-Ben! Ben!

47
00:06:38,469 --> 00:06:42,000
Help! Somebody, they're taking my husband.

48
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,070
How ore you feeling, Mr Matthews?

49
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,986
I'm glad you speak English.

50
00:07:03,086 --> 00:07:05,992
Listen, whoever you are,
somebody has made a terrible mistake.

51
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:08,550
There is no mistake,
we know your identity, Mr Matthews.

52
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,146
Than how can you say
that there's been no mistake.

53
00:07:10,246 --> 00:07:13,240
I say that because there is nothing
that can't be rectified in a few days.

54
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,030
What about my wife and daughter?

55
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,901
Don't worry, they're leaving on schedule.

56
00:07:17,001 --> 00:07:19,334
Why can't I leave with them?
I was cleared to leave.

57
00:07:19,434 --> 00:07:21,311
You are the only one we're interested in.

58
00:07:21,411 --> 00:07:24,990
Me? Why me? Have I done something wrong?

59
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:26,996
I'm the one to ask the questions,
Mr Matthews.

60
00:07:27,096 --> 00:07:28,725
You're in my country, not yours.

61
00:07:28,825 --> 00:07:30,750
In my country,
this wouldn't be happening to me.

62
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,704
I understand your anxiety.

63
00:07:32,804 --> 00:07:35,168
These are difficult times,
the rules have changed.

64
00:07:35,268 --> 00:07:38,830
What rules? We're not at war.
I'm not a soldier, I'm a teacher.

65
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,354
What's happening here seems
to defy all reason.

66
00:07:41,454 --> 00:07:44,150
There are reasons, Mr Matthews,
and they are not to be questioned.

67
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,630
I'm in control here not you.

68
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:49,012
Look, I'm just merely looking
for some common ground,

69
00:07:49,112 --> 00:07:50,167
some logic.

70
00:07:50,267 --> 00:07:52,030
Why are all you people in such a rush
to go home?

71
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,861
We've only been here six hours.

72
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,022
-Who are you?
-Only your host.

73
00:07:57,122 --> 00:07:58,623
Are you frightened, Mr Matthews?

74
00:07:58,723 --> 00:08:04,320
Yes, I am frightened because I don't know
why you are holding me here.

75
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,040
Don't worry,
nothing is going to happen to you.

76
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,518
You are my guest of honor.

77
00:08:11,618 --> 00:08:13,443
Your brother and I are old friends.

78
00:08:13,543 --> 00:08:16,385
-Doug? You know Doug?
-Oh, yes.

79
00:08:16,485 --> 00:08:17,821
He is very special to me.

80
00:08:17,921 --> 00:08:20,841
On his last trip, you might say
he left an indelible impression.

81
00:08:20,941 --> 00:08:23,150
Than why are you holding me here?

82
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:26,271
Because you're special also
to Douglass, to me.

83
00:08:26,371 --> 00:08:28,261
I don't want you to leave Iraq

84
00:08:28,361 --> 00:08:31,440
without experiencing more
of our culture and traditions.

85
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:35,680
You enjoy your stay, Mr Matthews. Salaam.

86
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,270
What kind of questions
did the Iraqis ask you?

87
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,990
They wanted to know
if anyone in our family

88
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,190
had ever visited Iraq before.

89
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,602
What did you say?

90
00:09:08,702 --> 00:09:10,630
That you had once served
with the military unit

91
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,264
attached to the American Embassy.

92
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,070
Did they ask you any other questions?

93
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,480
Yeah, they wanted to know exactly
when you were there.

94
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:23,280
Was anyone else signaled out of the line
besides Ben?

95
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,160
No.

96
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,710
Hi, Sidney, how you doing?

97
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,030
-Hi, Doug.
-How's the leg?

98
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,062
Oh, it's been a bitch.

99
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,750
I hope I don't have to go
on that table again.

100
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,990
Two times are enough.

101
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,440
I need your help.

102
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,240
Doug, I know about it.

103
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:54,486
It's, uh, it's gonna be tough for me
to help you.

104
00:09:54,586 --> 00:09:55,480
Why?

105
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,123
This is my brother
we're talking about, Sidney.

106
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:00,590
He's a hostage with diabetes

107
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,360
whose gonna die
if he doesn't get out soon.

108
00:10:03,431 --> 00:10:05,080
Now as a friend, you get me into Iraq.

109
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:09,270
Jesus, Doug, you're persona non grata
or have you forgotten

110
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,270
about all the embarrassment
and trouble you've caused us?

111
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,870
That was five years ago.

112
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,920
Not long enough to heal a scar.

113
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:18,400
We went through a lot of bother
to save your neck from that noose.

114
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,047
-Stay away from Iraq.
-No way, Sid.

115
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,670
This is my brother.
If he's in any kind of danger.

116
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,480
I'm going to get him home anyway I can,
whether you like it or not.

117
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,000
Take care of that leg.

118
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,040
Jeez, I like that guy.

119
00:11:20,239 --> 00:11:21,368
What are you doing?

120
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,642
I need some water.

121
00:11:23,742 --> 00:11:25,856
No water, your medicine.

122
00:11:25,956 --> 00:11:28,623
My medicine. Is it my insulin?

123
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,138
-Are you sure it's my insulin?
-I think so.

124
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,173
-What does it look like?
-Medicine.

125
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,854
-You hit bone.
-Sorry.

126
00:11:47,954 --> 00:11:51,747
-May I show you how to do it?
-No, you can't take this off.

127
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:53,760
Fine.

128
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03,115
-Can I have some water now?
-Not now.

129
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,840
You can pull it out now.

130
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,280
Thanks.

131
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,719
How much further is it
to the Iraqi border?

132
00:12:44,819 --> 00:12:47,306
I'm only taking you
as far as the refugee camp

133
00:12:47,406 --> 00:12:48,590
and we're almost there.

134
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:52,704
Why are you in such a rush to get to Iraq?
When most Americans are trying to get out?

135
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,727
Sounds like you drive there often.
Is that true?

136
00:12:55,827 --> 00:12:59,126
No. Just my family
and good American dollars.

137
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,885
How far is it from the refugee camp
to the Iraqi border?

138
00:13:02,985 --> 00:13:04,910
Not too far they come and stop.

139
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,310
-Why do you
-What happens to the trucks

140
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,830
and cars after they've arrived?

141
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,990
Turn around and go back.
Why do you ask so many questions?

142
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,240
Are you a spy?

143
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,480
Just curious.

144
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,374
You must be a writing person, huh?

145
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,350
How did you guess?

146
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,806
My business to know such things.

147
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:41,110
Here we are.

148
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,750
This is as far as I go.

149
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:45,162
It will be 24 American dollars.

150
00:13:45,262 --> 00:13:46,404
I wait tor you?

151
00:13:46,504 --> 00:13:48,667
Not unless your wife has a sense of humor.

152
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,000
Hey, American.

153
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,400
Want hash, coke.

154
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,092
A woman?

155
00:14:14,192 --> 00:14:15,212
What else you got?

156
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,480
What do you need?

157
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,520
A gun.

158
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,440
Follow me.

159
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,985
I'll take this, what else you got?

160
00:15:08,085 --> 00:15:10,973
-Many grenades.
-Show me.

161
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,559
These are duds,
the pins have been changed.

162
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:27,012
I'll take this one, this one.

163
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,000
I'll take these. How much?

164
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:37,395
One hundred fifty dollars, American,
and in cash.

165
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,680
-I'll give you a hundred.
-One hundred twenty.

166
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,534
Thank you. Thank you very much, man.

167
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,480
Lila.

168
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,000
-How have you been?
-Fine.

169
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,760
What are you doing here?

170
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,240
Just doing my bit
for the American Red Cross.

171
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,360
Oh, strange I haven't run into you before.

172
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:22,320
I'm here almost every day. Excuse me.

173
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:28,510
Give these pills to him twice a day,
morning and night.

174
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,390
-OK.
-OK, he'll be fine.

175
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,440
Thank you.

176
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,080
So you did it.

177
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,200
You got your medical degree.

178
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,880
Yes, I did.

179
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,000
That's great.

180
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,440
How's your son?

181
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:50,920
He's fine.

182
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:54,753
-How old is he now?
-Four.

183
00:17:54,853 --> 00:17:56,560
You didn't waste any time, did you?

184
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,960
Do your house calls
usually take you this far from Baghdad?

185
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,160
I go where I'm needed.

186
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,800
You didn't go far enough, Lila.

187
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:17,280
-Ready.
-Thank you, Sager.

188
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,240
I'll be out in a minute.

189
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,000
Well.

190
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,560
-It was good seeing you again.
-Likewise.

191
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,440
Good luck.

192
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,120
Thank you.

193
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,080
The last truck. Right here.

194
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:55,920
I don't believe it.

195
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,910
You're not supposed to be here
in this country.

196
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:02,880
I know.

197
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:07,670
Well, you must be here on business.
For who?

198
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,880
-For me, they have my brother.
-Yeah?

199
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,969
They took him hostage at the airport,

200
00:25:13,069 --> 00:25:15,992
singled him out of line just before
he was about to board the plane.

201
00:25:16,092 --> 00:25:18,720
-No one's seen him since.
-Dallal.

202
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,230
Pity you didn't kill him five years ago.

203
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,320
I need your help.

204
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,406
I am a Kurd remember?

205
00:25:26,506 --> 00:25:29,880
And anytime a Kurd can piss on Dallal,
it's a holiday.

206
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:34,720
My friend, insults here
can only be washed away with blood.

207
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,600
Doug, does anyone else know
you're here in Baghdad?

208
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,070
-I did run into someone.
-Who?

209
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,216
-Lila.
-You saw Lila?

210
00:25:44,316 --> 00:25:46,270
Yeah, we met accidentally
at the refugee camp

211
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,952
on the other side of the border.

212
00:25:48,052 --> 00:25:49,474
It's dangerous.

213
00:25:49,574 --> 00:25:50,830
You know she married Ali Dallal.

214
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,120
She knows nothing.

215
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,436
How she married him, I still don't know.

216
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,200
Oh, different worlds, my friend.

217
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:01,600
Wash up, you look like hell.

218
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,760
Thank you.

219
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:07,670
According to our latest report,

220
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,350
there are approximately 200 British
and American foreigners

221
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:13,760
within Baghdad who remain
unregistered and unaccounted for.

222
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:17,030
I expect with our added patrols
and increased wire taps

223
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,979
that that number will decrease rapidly.

224
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:22,030
However, it is important to remember
that anyone found is to be interrogated

225
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:27,320
with the utmost courtesy,
respect and Iraqi hospitality.

226
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:29,642
<i>Urgent sir.</i>

227
00:26:29,742 --> 00:26:30,640
Bring it in.

228
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,470
Careful with their faces,

229
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,240
no marks should be seen
on television, huh.

230
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,029
-When did this happen?
-This morning, sir.

231
00:26:39,129 --> 00:26:41,049
Escaped with a jeep,
killed all the guards.

232
00:26:41,149 --> 00:26:42,160
Dismissed.

233
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,800
Colonel Bashir.

234
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,160
I'm very disappointed.

235
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,870
It seems that your men permitted
a foreign intruder

236
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:58,750
to penetrate a vital line of our defenses

237
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:01,229
it's the line
that leads directly to Baghdad.

238
00:27:01,329 --> 00:27:02,840
I'll take care of them at once.

239
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,600
A little late for that
don't you think Major?

240
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:09,040
Your men should have been better prepared.

241
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,440
Why weren't they?

242
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,360
I don't know.
I'll get to the bottom of it.

243
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,251
No. We can't afford mistakes like this,

244
00:27:19,351 --> 00:27:21,720
I assure you
there will be no more mistakes.

245
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,680
You've disappointed me.

246
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,600
There is only one way
to make certain it never happens again.

247
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,200
Ali, are you in there?

248
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:31,760
It's Lila?

249
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,040
Yes dear.

250
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:39,214
-Oh, I'm sorry I was looking for Daud.
-Oh no, it's quite all right.

251
00:27:39,314 --> 00:27:41,070
Colonel Bashir
was just concluding his report.

252
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,790
-General Dallal.
-It's all right my friend,

253
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,430
you pass the message along to your men.

254
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,480
Thank you, sir.

255
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:54,423
-To what do I owe this pleasant surprise?
-You know well enough.

256
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,772
I've asked you a dozen times
not to bring Daud to these meetings.

257
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:01,864
He should be at home right now, sleeping.

258
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:03,720
It's harmless.

259
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,680
The boy's perfectly at ease here.

260
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:10,670
It's not harmless for a 4-year-old
to play with live bullets.

261
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,530
Please Ali,
don't disrupt the schedule again.

262
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:17,480
May I say that you look
particularly radiant today, Lila.

263
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:22,036
I repeat, Ali,
don't disrupt this schedule again.

264
00:28:22,136 --> 00:28:25,630
Must be all that fresh air you get
when you visit the refugee camps, huh?

265
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,680
Poor people.

266
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,200
Fresh air is about the only thing left
for them.

267
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:32,480
Yeah. Guess it's all that fresh air,
huh, Lila?

268
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:37,406
The jeep the foreigner used
was found in the Surabaya district,

269
00:28:37,506 --> 00:28:38,760
on the other side of town.

270
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:43,110
Double every sentry post in the area,
arrest anyone found without proper ID.

271
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,315
I want every sewer, every alley searched.

272
00:28:45,415 --> 00:28:46,870
Whoever he is,
he's in Baghdad for a reason

273
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,070
and I want him caught
before he does any more damage.

274
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:52,590
Any Iraqi helping him
is to be shot dead on the spot.

275
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:55,800
I want that foreigner caught
and bring my car.

276
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,680
I want to visit my special quest.

277
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,600
We're going home, Ali.

278
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:05,880
Goodbye.

279
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,360
-Have a pleasant evening, Lila.
-Thank you.

280
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:22,750
Asha, you take Daud home.
I've got work to do at hospital.

281
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:25,287
-I'll see you at the house, OK?
-OK.

282
00:29:25,387 --> 00:29:27,320
Goodnight. Be a good boy.

283
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,880
I made a contact
with the American Embassy.

284
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:42,829
-We have a meeting in half an hour.
-Great with who?

285
00:29:42,929 --> 00:29:46,080
Joe Allbalo. He is an undersecretary
I know. A good friend.

286
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,080
And we are leaving soon.

287
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,147
-I'll be ready.
-OK.

288
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,133
-Why don't you eat?
-I'm not hungry.

289
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,840
Eat this, good stuff.

290
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:01,880
I'll be back.

291
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,120
-It will take a while.
-I'll walk.

292
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:05,880
Hello Tanzi!

293
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,400
Lila.

294
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,399
Can I speak to you?

295
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:11,720
Of course.

296
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,790
Where is he, Tanzi? I'm looking for Doug.

297
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,350
I'm afraid you have made a mistake,
Mrs Dallal...

298
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,640
Please, Tanzi, no games.

299
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,230
I'm sorry, but I must get back to work.

300
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,893
-He could be in grave danger.
-Tanzi, it's OK, I 'II talk to her.

301
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,880
I knew I'd find you here.

302
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,440
Still reading my mind.

303
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,040
I thought we'd never meet again.

304
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,360
-Does he know?
-He's very suspicious.

305
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,040
He has his entire army
looking for an American.

306
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,680
What are you doing here?

307
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,873
Thanks for the warning. I'll be OK.

308
00:31:59,973 --> 00:32:02,834
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I've got some things to do.

309
00:32:02,934 --> 00:32:04,136
You're still hurt, aren't you?

310
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:05,880
Why should I be?

311
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,800
Doug, I couldn't answer your letters.

312
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,440
Dallal is a very jealous
and dangerous man.

313
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,400
You shouldn't be here now either,
should you?

314
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:20,630
-I'm here because your life is in danger.
-Thanks, I'll manage.

315
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,120
-Doug, I couldn't...
-Thanks.

316
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,960
Doug, it's time to go.

317
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,560
Everything is OK?

318
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,480
Let's go.

319
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,640
As-Salaam-Alaikum, Mr Matthews.

320
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,080
Whose there?

321
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,096
Have you already forgotten your friend,
your host?

322
00:33:08,196 --> 00:33:09,909
Ali Dallal at your service.

323
00:33:10,009 --> 00:33:11,230
Why are you holding me?

324
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:13,007
Is there anything wrong, Mr Matthews?

325
00:33:13,107 --> 00:33:15,647
Do you have any complaints
about your treatment

326
00:33:15,747 --> 00:33:16,891
you are getting your shots.

327
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,230
Any complaints about our menu?

328
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:22,939
Are you punishing me
because of something that my brother did?

329
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:25,397
Speaking of your brother,
when did you see him last?

330
00:33:25,497 --> 00:33:26,783
A long time ago.

331
00:33:26,883 --> 00:33:28,635
You must miss him very much.

332
00:33:28,735 --> 00:33:31,720
-Yes, I do.
-Me too, Mr Matthews, me too.

333
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:35,880
But I have a strange feeling
that he will come visit you very soon.

334
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,398
Are you using me as bait?

335
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,831
You dumb son of a bitch.

336
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,666
My brother will never come back
to Iraq again.

337
00:33:46,766 --> 00:33:48,233
Relax, Mr Matthews.

338
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:51,720
Anger is very bad for diabetes.

339
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:55,407
Your brother loves you very much
he will come.

340
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,680
He will come.

341
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:10,920
Let's make his stay more pleasant.
Move him to the hotel.

342
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,400
Sure it's safe?

343
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:22,880
It's a deserted shopping place.
No one out here.

344
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,310
See that we're not interrupted.

345
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:29,520
If I'm not back in 30 minutes,
you're outta here.

346
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,000
Mr Matthews?

347
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,834
-Allbalo?
-Yes.

348
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:03,202
Tanzi, said you saw my brother
being abducted.

349
00:35:03,302 --> 00:35:06,203
-Is that true?
-Yes, and that's the last time I saw him.

350
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,350
In the last 48 hours
the Iraqis have shot down

351
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,488
every inquiry we have made.

352
00:35:11,588 --> 00:35:12,913
It's like it never happened.

353
00:35:13,013 --> 00:35:15,679
-Well, it did.
-Please let me tell you where we're at.

354
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:19,870
Right now, our orders are to back peddle,
not to make waves.

355
00:35:19,970 --> 00:35:23,115
To do everything possible
to keep the lid on tight.

356
00:35:23,215 --> 00:35:26,230
We don't want to be the excuse
to set off the whale powder keg.

357
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,831
So what are you telling me?

358
00:35:27,931 --> 00:35:30,070
That you're in the wrong place
at the wrong time,

359
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,030
you can't expect any help from us,

360
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:35,937
and as far as you're concerned,
we're closed down until further notice.

361
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:49,869
Listen, Mr Matthews, for what its worth.

362
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,557
I heard a rumor that they're keeping
a bunch of detainees

363
00:35:54,657 --> 00:35:56,631
at a chemical plant on Husson Street.

364
00:35:56,731 --> 00:35:58,280
A few miles south of here.

365
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,480
Good luck.

366
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:58,840
Doug!

367
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:01,920
Let's go.

368
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:17,110
Look at that,
they're waiting outside your factory.

369
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,400
Don't stop, keep going.

370
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,320
I hope they didn't see us.

371
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:24,955
What's next? The electric plant?

372
00:38:25,055 --> 00:38:27,900
It's too dangerous.
I gotta get some rest.

373
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,080
I know where to go.

374
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,708
-What's the occasion?
-Celebrating my new nephew.

375
00:38:52,808 --> 00:38:54,280
I didn't think I'd make it.

376
00:41:20,937 --> 00:41:24,553
Attention all Kurdish Iraqi citizens.

377
00:41:24,653 --> 00:41:28,247
You are not in danger
if you obey our instructions.

378
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,958
We know the American is with you.

379
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:36,934
Surrender him in the next five minutes
and we will go in peace.

380
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:40,760
It's Dallal.

381
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,550
You've got to make a break for it.
Come on.

382
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:46,790
No. Put the gun away.
I'm going out there.

383
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:49,147
No Doug, don't do this.

384
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:51,990
There's too many of them.
We don't have a choice.

385
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:54,190
We do have a choice.
There is only one choice.

386
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,160
I said no!

387
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:11,480
Doug.

388
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:19,902
2 minutes, 10 seconds.

389
00:43:20,002 --> 00:43:24,075
Most cooperative of you Mr Matthews.
OK, I'm here now.

390
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:28,074
-Don't harm these people.
-Harm?

391
00:43:28,174 --> 00:43:31,594
Today is the happiest day of my life
no one will be harmed today.

392
00:43:31,694 --> 00:43:34,509
I have waited a very long time
for this moment.

393
00:43:34,609 --> 00:43:37,430
I can't wait to tell Lila you're back.
She'll be so pleased.

394
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:39,181
Where's my brother? Is he still alive?

395
00:43:39,281 --> 00:43:40,880
Oh, he is my special guest.

396
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:43,470
He's enjoying Iraqi hospitality
to the fullest.

397
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:44,520
I want to see him.

398
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:47,001
I want to see him now...

399
00:43:48,591 --> 00:43:49,490
...alive.

400
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,310
There's an old Arab saying,

401
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:54,372
"Things done in a hurry
are done in the ways of Satan."

402
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:58,799
But things done with patience
are done in the ways of God.

403
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:01,897
You two haven't seen each other
for a long, long time.

404
00:44:01,997 --> 00:44:05,893
A brothers reunion
needs a special preparation.

405
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:08,440
Patience my friend.

406
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:10,800
It's everything in life.

407
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:13,320
Take him away.

408
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:21,960
Fire!

409
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:26,600
No!

410
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:28,040
No!

411
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:30,230
Dallal!

412
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:31,640
What are you doing?!

413
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,960
No, Tanzi!! Tanzi!

414
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:50,887
Dallal,stop it.

415
00:44:50,987 --> 00:44:52,910
You butcher, you go to hell!

416
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,434
No Dallal!

417
00:44:54,534 --> 00:44:56,960
You butcher, you go to hell!

418
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:58,920
Do you hear me?

419
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:00,160
You go to hell!

420
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:08,575
-Hello?
<i>-Hello my darling, Lila.</i>

421
00:47:08,675 --> 00:47:09,800
<i>I have a great idea.</i>

422
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:11,274
<i>How about dining out tonight?</i>

423
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:14,179
Oh, what's the happy occasion?

424
00:47:14,279 --> 00:47:17,150
Let's say I'm celebrating
a successful hunt.

425
00:47:17,250 --> 00:47:18,245
<i>Hunt?</i>

426
00:47:18,345 --> 00:47:19,245
Yes.

427
00:47:21,268 --> 00:47:23,072
I caught a rare prey

428
00:47:23,172 --> 00:47:26,160
<i>two wild American Eagles,
first time in captivity.</i>

429
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:28,578
Calls for a real feast.

430
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:31,591
So, shall I have you picked up?

431
00:47:31,691 --> 00:47:34,330
Oh, I'm sorry, but I'm working late.

432
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:37,701
<i>Oh Lila, you're such a dedicated Doctor.</i>

433
00:47:38,854 --> 00:47:39,863
Good night.

434
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:57,840
Hello.

435
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:00,320
Colonel Bashir, please.

436
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:08,274
Stay here, let me see
what Miss Lila wants.

437
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:32,030
What happened Lila?

438
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:33,040
I need your help.

439
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,240
I've an order to release you.

440
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:28,533
Wait, General Dallal wants him.

441
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:09,360
Doug! There you are.

442
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:15,830
Hi, they took your brother
to Hotel Sertan. Room 1124.

443
00:51:15,930 --> 00:51:17,471
You didn't tell me he's a diabetic.

444
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:20,630
I'll wait for you at my friends house,
here's the address,

445
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:24,490
and please be careful. Bye.

446
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:28,320
He what?

447
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:30,200
He escaped?

448
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:33,560
You're all dead men.

449
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:36,560
I want his brother removed
from that hotel immediately.

450
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:42,897
-Time to eat now.
-What is it?

451
00:51:42,997 --> 00:51:45,670
-Grapes.
-I can't have grapes right now.

452
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:47,205
Grapes is good. Healthy.

453
00:51:47,305 --> 00:51:48,287
What else do you have?

454
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:50,116
Try this.

455
00:51:50,216 --> 00:51:51,559
-What is it?
-Taste.

456
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:54,070
Ah, it's too sweet.

457
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:55,487
Do you have any bread?

458
00:51:55,587 --> 00:51:56,750
Bread, yes.

459
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:58,993
-We have to take him now.
-Remove?

460
00:51:59,093 --> 00:52:00,252
Yes.

461
00:52:00,352 --> 00:52:01,465
Where are we going?

462
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:09,310
We are waiting for you.

463
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:10,920
Drop it! Drop it!

464
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:25,560
Get up! Get up!

465
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:31,120
I want to see my brother.

466
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:50,080
Doug.

467
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:53,760
-You're bleeding.
-Never mind.

468
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:57,630
Got to find my brother
before Dallal kills him.

469
00:56:57,720 --> 00:56:58,971
Like he did Tanzi!

470
00:56:59,071 --> 00:57:00,590
-Tanzi's dead?
-Yes. Tanzi's dead.

471
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:02,120
How could you have married him?

472
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:04,600
I had to.

473
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:08,360
-What do you mean you had to?
-I just had to, that's all...

474
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:11,040
Why?

475
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:13,520
I did it for you.

476
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:17,520
What are you talking about?

477
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:19,600
Doug...

478
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:24,800
...my marriage to Dallal was a deal.

479
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:31,240
If I didn't marry him
you would have been killed.

480
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:36,720
And I couldn't live with it.

481
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:41,760
I was educated
to accept everything in life as fate.

482
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:46,200
But in my world,
fate is controlled by men.

483
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:52,393
And to my husband, revenge is sacred.

484
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:55,903
And hatred, noble.

485
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:00,360
I'm sorry.

486
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:04,720
I have got to go.
I want you to stay here.

487
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:09,872
I'll be back in two hours
with the information about Ben.

488
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:15,652
I don't want you to go again. Not again.

489
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:21,110
No, Doug it's too late.

490
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:26,480
It's not too late. I love you, Lila.
I love you.

491
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:52,400
I'll be back.

492
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:29,200
Ali.

493
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:35,160
You're home early.

494
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:39,446
You missed a wonderful party
this evening, my dear.

495
01:00:39,546 --> 01:00:42,440
Unfortunately it was interrupted
in a most unpleasant way.

496
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:46,280
So I thought I'd come visit you
in your room for some comfort.

497
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:50,080
Sorry, but my day was hectic too.

498
01:00:50,760 --> 01:00:51,960
And it's not over yet.

499
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:56,480
I just came to freshen up
and check on Daud.

500
01:00:57,080 --> 01:00:59,920
-Daud is fine, he's fast asleep.
-Yeah.

501
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:04,280
We have an emergency at the hospital
and I've got to go back there.

502
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:07,320
My busy, busy wife.

503
01:01:08,560 --> 01:01:12,200
Always being so responsible, so efficient.

504
01:01:13,120 --> 01:01:15,640
I believe in America they call that,
what Women's Lib.

505
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:21,320
-But we're not in American, are we, Lila?
-No, we're not.

506
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:26,200
But I'm still a Doctor.

507
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:28,480
And I've got to get back to the hospital.

508
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:35,920
You were with him tonight weren't you?

509
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,405
Who are you taking about?

510
01:01:39,505 --> 01:01:40,440
The American.

511
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:44,000
Douglass Matthews escaped
from my prison a few hours ago.

512
01:01:44,680 --> 01:01:48,720
I was wondering who would be so stupid
to try to help him.

513
01:01:57,120 --> 01:02:00,117
-Now I know.
-This is ridiculous.

514
01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:01,880
I haven't seen anybody.

515
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:05,098
Don't lie to me.
You were always a bad liar.

516
01:02:05,198 --> 01:02:07,580
You never spoke of him directly
in my presence

517
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:09,728
but you always knew when he was around.

518
01:02:09,828 --> 01:02:11,809
And afterwards you'd always glow.

519
01:02:11,909 --> 01:02:14,350
You'd glow the same way you glowed
when you came home this evening.

520
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:16,390
-Ali...
-I'd give anything to make you feel

521
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:17,823
that way about me.

522
01:02:17,923 --> 01:02:19,853
Please Ali, I've got to go.

523
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:21,520
It's true isn't it?

524
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:23,885
All these years,

525
01:02:23,985 --> 01:02:25,350
he's been the one
to know all your secrets.

526
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:27,739
Your desires
when I couldn't even hold you.

527
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:30,270
Well, tonight it's my turn
to make you glow.

528
01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:31,190
No!

529
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:33,115
-Is this isn't it?
-What?

530
01:02:33,215 --> 01:02:34,331
Your scar?

531
01:02:34,431 --> 01:02:37,081
Your scar is the most
beautiful part of your body.

532
01:02:37,181 --> 01:02:38,470
Why is that? Because you think I'm weak.

533
01:02:38,560 --> 01:02:41,790
I didn't kill him
because I let my desire for you blind me?

534
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:43,644
-Is that why you love my scar?
-No.

535
01:02:43,744 --> 01:02:46,640
I love your scar because it reminds me
of the man who did it.

536
01:02:47,160 --> 01:02:48,011
Bitch!

537
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:50,361
You know there's a lesson
in all this my dear.

538
01:03:50,461 --> 01:03:51,800
Go ahead ask me what it is.

539
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:56,630
OK, I'll tell you anyway.
Independence for a woman is a gift.

540
01:03:56,720 --> 01:03:58,685
It comes on a silver platter.

541
01:03:58,785 --> 01:04:02,070
Once you forget who gave it to you,
you lose all rights to it.

542
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:06,497
Oh, by the way, if you should happen
to bump into your boyfriend...

543
01:04:07,240 --> 01:04:10,035
...you can tell him from me
that he'll never get out of Iraq alive.

544
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:13,760
I've posted a reward for any soldier
that cuts out his heart.

545
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:16,318
What's going to happen to his brother?

546
01:04:16,418 --> 01:04:18,460
He's going to be executed very soon.

547
01:04:18,560 --> 01:04:20,861
And my son, your beloved Daud
is going to watch him die.

548
01:04:21,738 --> 01:04:22,904
What?

549
01:04:23,004 --> 01:04:25,523
A good son must always stand

550
01:04:25,623 --> 01:04:27,812
at his fathers side
in his proudest moments.

551
01:04:28,760 --> 01:04:31,880
You do that and I'll kill you.

552
01:04:35,320 --> 01:04:36,400
One final note.

553
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:39,213
I've decided you're not fit
to be his mother.

554
01:04:39,313 --> 01:04:43,214
From now on you're no longer to see him
or call yourself his mother.

555
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:47,053
-A cheap whore is a better name for you.
-Damn you!

556
01:05:12,040 --> 01:05:13,430
Wake the boy and get him dressed.

557
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:15,200
-But Sir...
-Do it that's an order.

558
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:22,607
Daud. Daud. Wake up.

559
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:24,510
You have to get dressed.

560
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:26,400
Your daddy's taking us someplace.

561
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:00,040
Bashir?

562
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:04,640
Sager!

563
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:16,800
-To Abaddon, Sir?
-Immediately.

564
01:07:33,160 --> 01:07:34,160
General Dallal.

565
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:37,916
Yes Sir. Yes Sir.

566
01:07:39,836 --> 01:07:41,326
Turn the car around.

567
01:07:41,426 --> 01:07:43,070
The Prime Minister wants
to see me right away.

568
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:44,040
Yes, Sir.

569
01:08:24,520 --> 01:08:25,480
Where were you?

570
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:29,520
I'm sorry, Doug.

571
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:32,600
What happened?

572
01:08:33,480 --> 01:08:34,480
He took my son.

573
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:36,910
You didn't answer my question.
Who did this to you?

574
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:37,932
Ali...

575
01:08:39,054 --> 01:08:39,970
...he raped me.

576
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:00,000
What is it Sager.?

577
01:09:03,480 --> 01:09:04,360
I'm sorry, Madam.

578
01:09:18,760 --> 01:09:20,960
-You're going to take us to Dallal.
-I don't know...

579
01:09:21,840 --> 01:09:22,830
Where 's my son?

580
01:09:22,920 --> 01:09:25,226
-I don't know.
-Where is my son?

581
01:09:25,326 --> 01:09:28,520
-Abo-Abo...
-Abaddon?

582
01:09:28,620 --> 01:09:30,765
Abaddon! The chemical roofers factory?

583
01:09:30,865 --> 01:09:32,628
Stop, I know where it is.

584
01:09:32,728 --> 01:09:35,981
It's the Abaddon chemical factory,
it's about half an hour driving.

585
01:09:39,480 --> 01:09:40,480
You're taking us there.

586
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:18,650
Open it!

587
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:43,750
The Prime Minister wants you
to release all the hostages.

588
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:47,120
I authorize you to do it,
except for Ben Matthews.

589
01:13:32,360 --> 01:13:33,440
It's out there, buddy.

590
01:16:01,320 --> 01:16:02,950
You get your son.
It's the first door on the left.

591
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:03,920
I'll get Ben.

592
01:16:07,480 --> 01:16:11,059
-Are you frightened, Mr Matthews?
-Yes, I am.

593
01:16:11,159 --> 01:16:12,216
You have every right to be...

594
01:16:29,880 --> 01:16:30,760
Shit.

595
01:16:32,680 --> 01:16:34,320
-You OK, Ben?
-I'll manage.

596
01:16:37,200 --> 01:16:38,150
Yeah, sure you will.

597
01:16:38,240 --> 01:16:39,920
-Doug!
-We're in here.

598
01:16:41,160 --> 01:16:42,010
The insulin.

599
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,630
OK, take this and get out
as fast as you can.

600
01:16:54,730 --> 01:16:56,703
If I'm not out within five minutes,
go without me.

601
01:16:59,720 --> 01:17:00,760
OK.

602
01:19:54,280 --> 01:19:57,113
OK, hold it! Everybody stop
what they're doing and get over here!

603
01:19:57,213 --> 01:19:58,120
Move!

604
01:19:58,720 --> 01:19:59,600
Get up!

605
01:20:01,280 --> 01:20:03,840
Get up! Out the door!
Out the door! Drop it!

606
01:20:04,440 --> 01:20:07,200
Come on! Move! Move it! Don't touch it!
