00:00:22,301 --> 00:00:25,937
Screaming like a little girl
won't help me fly this baby!

4
00:00:28,574 --> 00:00:30,508
Uh...

5
00:00:30,509 --> 00:00:31,742
Captain to co-captain...

6
00:00:31,743 --> 00:00:33,778
"Captain" implies
that you actually know

7
00:00:33,779 --> 00:00:35,179
how to fly this thing.

8
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:36,681
Chill! It's just
like <i>Nitromaniacs.</i>

9
00:00:36,682 --> 00:00:38,850
That's a video game!
This is an airplane!

10
00:00:38,851 --> 00:00:41,152
And when my mom
finds out we stole it...

11
00:00:41,153 --> 00:00:43,754
We didn't steal it.
It's Jensen property.

12
00:00:43,755 --> 00:00:46,824
I'm a Jensen employee,
and we're on a Jensen mission.

13
00:00:46,825 --> 00:00:48,860
She'll buy that!
Oh, I'm so dead!

14
00:00:48,861 --> 00:00:51,095
Not if we get back
the molecular assembler

15
00:00:51,096 --> 00:00:52,797
and save the world!

16
00:00:52,798 --> 00:00:54,999
Trust me, you'll go from
juvie to hero in one night.

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,434
Assuming I survive this--

18
00:00:56,435 --> 00:00:57,735
- Hang on!
- Ahh!

19
00:01:23,262 --> 00:01:25,730
Brody, how many times
do I have to tell you

20
00:01:25,731 --> 00:01:26,731
to use a glass?

21
00:01:28,433 --> 00:01:30,468
Brody!

22
00:01:33,906 --> 00:01:35,172
Ah! Oh!

23
00:01:35,173 --> 00:01:36,507
Ah...

24
00:01:42,548 --> 00:01:44,015
Thanks!

25
00:01:44,016 --> 00:01:45,716
Keys! Keys!
Has anybody seen my keys?

26
00:01:45,717 --> 00:01:46,784
Entryway table.

27
00:01:46,785 --> 00:01:48,252
Not there.

28
00:01:48,253 --> 00:01:50,254
The pants you were
wearing last night.

29
00:01:50,255 --> 00:01:51,255
Here.

30
00:01:51,256 --> 00:01:52,757
You're a genius!
Ow! Ow!

31
00:01:52,758 --> 00:01:54,158
So I've been told.

32
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:58,029
Hey, Mom, I don't
feel that great.

33
00:01:58,030 --> 00:01:59,297
Can I stay home?

34
00:01:59,298 --> 00:02:01,432
You don't seem feverish.

35
00:02:01,433 --> 00:02:02,466
Well...

36
00:02:03,468 --> 00:02:05,536
It--it's more in my chest.

37
00:02:05,537 --> 00:02:06,871
You stay up
late texting,

38
00:02:06,872 --> 00:02:09,173
leave your homework
to the last second,

39
00:02:09,174 --> 00:02:10,841
and now all of a sudden
you're sick?

40
00:02:10,842 --> 00:02:12,376
I don't think so!

41
00:02:12,377 --> 00:02:14,111
But what if I infect
the whole school?

42
00:02:14,112 --> 00:02:17,214
Luckily, your father's
specialty is immunology!

43
00:02:22,888 --> 00:02:24,255
Brody...

44
00:02:27,025 --> 00:02:29,594
Listen, I know you
find school boring.

45
00:02:29,595 --> 00:02:31,195
Just try to make
the most of it.

46
00:02:32,631 --> 00:02:34,031
Whatever.

47
00:02:50,382 --> 00:02:52,583
-  everything OK?
- Fine.

48
00:02:52,584 --> 00:02:53,951
Are you sure?

49
00:02:53,952 --> 00:02:56,988
We'll talk about it
another time.

50
00:02:56,989 --> 00:02:58,856
Suit yourself.

51
00:02:58,857 --> 00:03:02,059
Oh, I gotta go. I booked
satellite time for my students.

52
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:03,094
I can't be late.

53
00:03:03,095 --> 00:03:04,462
Whoa! I already am late!

54
00:03:30,422 --> 00:03:32,456
<i>This is Claire Thompson.</i>
<i>We're not home.</i>

55
00:03:32,457 --> 00:03:34,592
But you can leave a message
<i>after the beep.</i>

56
00:03:50,208 --> 00:03:52,009
<i>You stay up late...</i>

57
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:53,778
...last possible second.

58
00:03:53,779 --> 00:03:55,513
You don't seem feverish.

59
00:03:56,515 --> 00:03:57,815
Infect the whole school...

60
00:04:03,889 --> 00:04:06,791
<i>Marshall Heights High School.</i>
<i>This is Mrs. Johnson.</i>

61
00:04:06,792 --> 00:04:08,359
<i>How may I help you?</i>

62
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,494
<i>This is Claire Thompson.</i>
<i>Brody stayed up late.</i>

63
00:04:10,495 --> 00:04:11,996
<i>He seems feverish.</i>

64
00:04:11,997 --> 00:04:13,998
<i>We don't want him to</i>
<i>infect the whole school.</i>

65
00:04:13,999 --> 00:04:15,366
We're gonna keep him home.

66
00:04:15,367 --> 00:04:16,834
<i>Thanks for calling.</i>

67
00:04:23,608 --> 00:04:26,010
If the com sat is
at current position,

68
00:04:26,011 --> 00:04:27,812
200 miles above the surface,

69
00:04:27,813 --> 00:04:30,014
and travelling
at a constant speed,

70
00:04:30,015 --> 00:04:32,917
who can tell me how long
we'll maintain contact

71
00:04:32,918 --> 00:04:34,819
at maximum-signal performance?

72
00:04:35,887 --> 00:04:37,054
Anyone?

73
00:04:40,025 --> 00:04:42,059
7.025 minutes.

74
00:04:43,795 --> 00:04:46,997
Quiz on chapters
10 through 14, guys, Monday!

75
00:04:46,998 --> 00:04:48,432
Please be prepared!

76
00:04:50,202 --> 00:04:51,702
Nice work, Josh.

77
00:04:51,703 --> 00:04:53,504
Can't believe
we got satellite time!

78
00:04:53,505 --> 00:04:55,473
I called in a favor.

79
00:04:55,474 --> 00:04:58,542
I just thought the class
would be more into it, though.

80
00:04:58,543 --> 00:05:00,511
Can I ask you
a question?

81
00:05:00,512 --> 00:05:02,079
- Sure.
- You went to MIT.

82
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,714
Graduated with
2 advanced degrees.

83
00:05:03,715 --> 00:05:06,217
Instead of telling us
about the latest tech,

84
00:05:06,218 --> 00:05:08,419
why aren't you
designing it?

85
00:05:11,389 --> 00:05:14,091
I have to take this.
I'll see you Monday.

86
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,427
Claire Thompson.

87
00:05:16,428 --> 00:05:18,562
<i>Hi, Mrs. Thompson!</i>
<i>It's Mrs. Banks</i>

88
00:05:18,563 --> 00:05:21,031
I emailed Brody
his homework assignment.

89
00:05:21,032 --> 00:05:22,199
Why?

90
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,235
The office said you called.

91
00:05:24,236 --> 00:05:25,236
I called?

92
00:05:25,237 --> 00:05:27,271
<i>About his being sick today.</i>

93
00:05:28,874 --> 00:05:29,907
Right.

94
00:05:29,908 --> 00:05:31,876
I hope he feels better.

95
00:05:33,578 --> 00:05:35,112
Not likely!

96
00:05:35,113 --> 00:05:37,248
Not after
I get done with him.

97
00:05:41,553 --> 00:05:43,320
E...

98
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:48,626
I...

99
00:05:48,627 --> 00:05:51,128
O...

100
00:05:51,129 --> 00:05:52,797
U...

101
00:05:54,032 --> 00:05:55,432
Whoo!

102
00:05:56,568 --> 00:05:59,036
It's like he can't
get a full breath.

103
00:05:59,037 --> 00:06:01,205
Does he have
a history of asthma?

104
00:06:01,206 --> 00:06:02,640
- No.
- Huh. Bronchitis?

105
00:06:02,641 --> 00:06:03,674
No.

106
00:06:03,675 --> 00:06:05,309
- Laryngitis?
- No.

107
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:06,410
Sinusitis?

108
00:06:06,411 --> 00:06:07,978
- No.
- Rhinitis?

109
00:06:07,979 --> 00:06:09,013
No.

110
00:06:09,014 --> 00:06:10,681
- Pneumothoraxis?
- No.

111
00:06:10,682 --> 00:06:12,416
- Aspergillosis?
- Mm-mmm.

112
00:06:12,417 --> 00:06:13,851
Hmm...

113
00:06:15,854 --> 00:06:17,221
You a smoker?

114
00:06:17,222 --> 00:06:18,222
No, sir.

115
00:06:18,223 --> 00:06:20,491
That's good.
Keep it up.

116
00:06:21,626 --> 00:06:23,160
OK...

117
00:06:23,161 --> 00:06:24,562
Open wide.

118
00:06:26,865 --> 00:06:28,766
Ahh...

119
00:06:30,068 --> 00:06:31,936
OK, I found
the problem, I think.

120
00:06:31,937 --> 00:06:33,737
Your son...

121
00:06:35,307 --> 00:06:39,176
has a very bad case
of rhinosis...

122
00:06:39,177 --> 00:06:41,178
gummerius...

123
00:06:41,179 --> 00:06:42,813
Is that serious?

124
00:06:42,814 --> 00:06:44,815
Not very...

125
00:06:44,816 --> 00:06:46,317
Quint!

126
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:51,889
I am so sorry to have
wasted your time, Doctor!

127
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:53,891
It could have been worse.

128
00:06:55,193 --> 00:06:57,194
It could have been
a real worm.

129
00:07:02,601 --> 00:07:03,868
Rough day?

130
00:07:06,037 --> 00:07:08,105
Nothing worth
talking about.

131
00:07:09,474 --> 00:07:11,175
What are you doing here?

132
00:07:11,176 --> 00:07:12,610
- It's Brody.
- What now?

133
00:07:12,611 --> 00:07:15,346
- He cut school, again!
- What do you mean, again?

134
00:07:15,347 --> 00:07:17,748
The school said that
he used your letterhead

135
00:07:17,749 --> 00:07:19,984
to write notes 3 times
in the last 2 months

136
00:07:19,985 --> 00:07:23,187
and that the next absence would
require a call from one of us.

137
00:07:23,188 --> 00:07:24,421
So he faked my voice.

138
00:07:24,422 --> 00:07:25,890
OK, how did he do that?

139
00:07:25,891 --> 00:07:27,291
I have no idea,

140
00:07:27,292 --> 00:07:29,860
but he was convincing enough
to fool his teachers.

141
00:07:29,861 --> 00:07:31,028
Ha-ha! Clever kid!

142
00:07:31,029 --> 00:07:32,663
Too clever for
his own good!

143
00:07:32,664 --> 00:07:34,198
Maybe that's the problem!

144
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:36,166
Maybe he's in
the wrong environment--

145
00:07:36,167 --> 00:07:37,501
Matt, don't start.

146
00:07:37,502 --> 00:07:40,571
Not talking about it
won't solve the problem, Claire.

147
00:07:40,572 --> 00:07:42,273
What is it?

148
00:07:48,246 --> 00:07:49,513
Ingrid?

149
00:07:55,487 --> 00:07:58,122
Claire, what a surprise
to see you here.

150
00:07:58,123 --> 00:07:59,423
Uh...

151
00:07:59,424 --> 00:08:00,524
ditto.

152
00:08:01,893 --> 00:08:03,594
So, uh...

153
00:08:03,595 --> 00:08:06,463
to what do we owe the honor
after all these years?

154
00:08:06,464 --> 00:08:09,433
The Jensen Project
is in trouble.

155
00:08:09,434 --> 00:08:12,369
I came to ask Claire
to help us.

156
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:13,370
Me?

157
00:08:13,371 --> 00:08:15,706
You want me to help you?

158
00:08:17,575 --> 00:08:21,745
OK, why don't we all sit down
and we'll talk about this--

159
00:08:21,746 --> 00:08:25,082
You two can talk all you want.
I'm out of here!

160
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:26,383
Claire...

161
00:08:27,385 --> 00:08:29,119
Honey, wait.

162
00:08:30,322 --> 00:08:31,622
Claire... Claire!

163
00:08:31,623 --> 00:08:33,257
- No! No! No!
- Hey!

164
00:08:33,258 --> 00:08:35,459
When I needed her,
she was not there for me!

165
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:37,428
There is no way
I'm gonna...

166
00:08:42,434 --> 00:08:43,968
Let's...

167
00:08:52,477 --> 00:08:54,778
When Edwin humiliated you...

168
00:08:54,779 --> 00:08:56,747
Today...

169
00:08:56,748 --> 00:09:00,084
we've just witnessed
utter failure.

170
00:09:01,586 --> 00:09:03,854
You were understandably
hurt by what he said.

171
00:09:03,855 --> 00:09:05,222
Hurt?

172
00:09:05,223 --> 00:09:06,390
As her mentor,

173
00:09:06,391 --> 00:09:09,126
I should have recognized
the limitations

174
00:09:09,127 --> 00:09:11,095
of her talent
and intellect.

175
00:09:11,096 --> 00:09:12,930
- I was devastated.
- I know.

176
00:09:12,931 --> 00:09:14,331
What he said was cruel.

177
00:09:14,332 --> 00:09:15,833
Your work...

178
00:09:15,834 --> 00:09:17,901
isn't good enough.

179
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:21,572
You... aren't good enough.

180
00:09:23,274 --> 00:09:26,677
<i>I admired Edwin more than</i>
<i>you could possibly imagine.</i>

181
00:09:28,046 --> 00:09:29,947
I think what hurt
more than his words

182
00:09:29,948 --> 00:09:32,116
was knowing how badly
I disappointed him.

183
00:09:32,117 --> 00:09:35,352
Nobody understands better
than me how it's haunted you.

184
00:09:35,353 --> 00:09:37,221
And I know you don't
wanna hear this,

185
00:09:37,222 --> 00:09:39,523
but I still think
we should talk to Ingrid.

186
00:09:39,524 --> 00:09:40,591
Why?

187
00:09:40,592 --> 00:09:42,960
Because maybe it's
an opportunity!

188
00:09:42,961 --> 00:09:45,529
What are you talking about?
An opportunity for what?

189
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:46,563
I don't know!

190
00:09:46,564 --> 00:09:48,632
I don't know.
To revisit the past!

191
00:09:48,633 --> 00:09:51,635
To somehow repair the damage
that was done to you.

192
00:09:51,636 --> 00:09:53,170
I have no idea.
But it...

193
00:09:53,171 --> 00:09:56,774
It can't hurt to hear
what Ingrid has to say!

194
00:09:58,009 --> 00:09:59,410
Please, Claire.

195
00:10:00,412 --> 00:10:01,779
Do this for me.

196
00:10:03,481 --> 00:10:05,049
Edwin left
the Jensen Project.

197
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:07,384
Took his whole team...

198
00:10:07,385 --> 00:10:09,753
and several
experimental projects,

199
00:10:09,754 --> 00:10:10,854
including yours.

200
00:10:10,855 --> 00:10:12,423
So? It didn't work. Remember?

201
00:10:12,424 --> 00:10:14,024
It works now.

202
00:10:15,226 --> 00:10:16,693
After you left,

203
00:10:16,694 --> 00:10:20,364
Edwin continued your research
on electro nanobots.

204
00:10:20,365 --> 00:10:21,365
He what?

205
00:10:21,366 --> 00:10:22,699
And over the years,

206
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,835
he perfected the work
that you created.

207
00:10:24,836 --> 00:10:26,904
This technology can save
millions of lives.

208
00:10:26,905 --> 00:10:29,540
It can just as easily
destroy millions.

209
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:31,375
I don't follow you. What--

210
00:10:31,376 --> 00:10:34,478
Nanobots are computers
the size of molecules.

211
00:10:34,479 --> 00:10:36,647
They can be implanted
in human tissue.

212
00:10:36,648 --> 00:10:38,015
In a battle,
for example,

213
00:10:38,016 --> 00:10:39,316
a soldier is wounded.

214
00:10:39,317 --> 00:10:41,318
If he's implanted
with a nanobot,

215
00:10:41,319 --> 00:10:43,954
it could tell the medics
his exact location.

216
00:10:43,955 --> 00:10:46,690
It could even stabilize
his bodily functions.

217
00:10:46,691 --> 00:10:47,724
That's good, no?

218
00:10:47,725 --> 00:10:49,159
Unless the enemy
gets control

219
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,028
of the computer that
manages the bots.

220
00:10:51,029 --> 00:10:53,263
They could wipe out
an entire army

221
00:10:53,264 --> 00:10:56,967
by giving every soldier
in the field a massive coronary.

222
00:10:56,968 --> 00:10:59,103
By simply
pressing a button.

223
00:11:00,772 --> 00:11:02,806
This technology
could be a blessing,

224
00:11:02,807 --> 00:11:04,208
or it could be
a nightmare,

225
00:11:04,209 --> 00:11:06,110
depending on
who's controlling it.

226
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:08,145
And right now
that's Edwin?

227
00:11:08,146 --> 00:11:09,913
That's why
I've come to you.

228
00:11:09,914 --> 00:11:12,783
When Edwin left,
he wiped the drives clean.

229
00:11:12,784 --> 00:11:14,985
I have no idea how he got
from my model to--

230
00:11:14,986 --> 00:11:17,087
You have more of an idea
than anyone else!

231
00:11:17,088 --> 00:11:19,156
Certainly anyone else
in the Jensen family!

232
00:11:19,157 --> 00:11:21,458
I haven't been in the family
in a long time.

233
00:11:21,459 --> 00:11:23,260
Why not go to
the authorities?

234
00:11:23,261 --> 00:11:26,463
The negative media spin could
destroy the Jensen Project

235
00:11:26,464 --> 00:11:28,832
and all of the good
work we've done!

236
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:30,234
We need you!

237
00:11:30,235 --> 00:11:33,303
We need both of you,
and we need you now.

238
00:11:40,578 --> 00:11:42,379
Whoo!

239
00:11:45,216 --> 00:11:48,652
Hey, Jimmy, I thought
$20 bought me another...

240
00:11:50,488 --> 00:11:51,722
What were you thinking?

241
00:11:51,723 --> 00:11:53,190
That you'd never find out.

242
00:11:53,191 --> 00:11:54,825
How'd you know
where I was, anyway?

243
00:11:54,826 --> 00:11:57,494
Your mom used a satellite
to track your cell phone.

244
00:11:57,495 --> 00:11:58,729
What?

245
00:11:58,730 --> 00:11:59,696
You pretended
to be me

246
00:11:59,697 --> 00:12:00,931
so you could
skip school.

247
00:12:00,932 --> 00:12:03,333
Not cool. Oh, and you
are totally grounded.

248
00:12:03,334 --> 00:12:04,468
Look, I can explain.

249
00:12:04,469 --> 00:12:06,370
I was testing rates
of noise reduction

250
00:12:06,371 --> 00:12:07,704
in isolated
audio signals.

251
00:12:07,705 --> 00:12:08,906
I wrote an app
that can--

252
00:12:08,907 --> 00:12:10,040
It doesn't matter.

253
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:11,475
You lied to the school

254
00:12:11,476 --> 00:12:12,776
and you lied to us.

255
00:12:12,777 --> 00:12:15,345
OK, I'm sorry.
Where are we going?

256
00:12:15,346 --> 00:12:18,148
We're sending you
to military school.

257
00:12:19,617 --> 00:12:21,018
What?

258
00:12:21,019 --> 00:12:24,288
Look, Mom, I'll change!
Can't we talk about this?

259
00:12:24,289 --> 00:12:26,590
You're not going
to military school!

260
00:12:26,591 --> 00:12:28,125
Then where are we going?

261
00:12:28,126 --> 00:12:30,093
- We're going back.
- Back where?

262
00:12:30,094 --> 00:12:31,628
To save the day, I hope!

263
00:12:31,629 --> 00:12:35,365
And while we're at it,
maybe the world!

264
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:49,364
Why did Edwin choose now
to leave the Project?

265
00:12:49,365 --> 00:12:52,301
My fault. He wanted to
skip the usual protocols

266
00:12:52,302 --> 00:12:54,736
and advance the nanobot
to its next phase.

267
00:12:54,737 --> 00:12:56,505
Just wanted him
to go slowly.

268
00:12:56,506 --> 00:12:59,942
Unfortunately, Edwin and I
don't communicate very well.

269
00:12:59,943 --> 00:13:01,910
Hey, Mom, what's
this Jensen Project

270
00:13:01,911 --> 00:13:03,378
you guys
keep talking about?

271
00:13:03,379 --> 00:13:05,347
It's a group of
really smart people

272
00:13:05,348 --> 00:13:08,083
who work together to make
the world a better place.

273
00:13:08,084 --> 00:13:09,818
How come I've never
heard of it?

274
00:13:09,819 --> 00:13:12,621
Let's just say that anonymity
is important to us.

275
00:13:12,622 --> 00:13:14,623
- So how do you join?
- You don't.

276
00:13:14,624 --> 00:13:15,924
You have to be invited.

277
00:13:15,925 --> 00:13:17,893
Are you guys,
like, members?

278
00:13:17,894 --> 00:13:19,328
We were...

279
00:13:19,329 --> 00:13:20,696
once.

280
00:13:20,697 --> 00:13:22,764
Ms. Jensen, we have
security clearance

281
00:13:22,765 --> 00:13:25,234
to land in the compound.

282
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:41,283
Your onco-gene research,
the glucose-monitoring device

283
00:13:41,284 --> 00:13:44,052
and your servomechanisms
for robotics...

284
00:13:44,053 --> 00:13:46,255
Truly transformative
work, Edwin.

285
00:13:46,256 --> 00:13:47,623
Thank you.

286
00:13:47,624 --> 00:13:50,459
But as we discussed,
it's your nanobot technology

287
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:52,961
that most interests
my associates and me.

288
00:13:52,962 --> 00:13:54,463
Well, I can see why.

289
00:13:54,464 --> 00:13:56,765
We're this close
to a breakthrough

290
00:13:56,766 --> 00:13:59,201
that could change
medicine forever.

291
00:13:59,202 --> 00:14:00,602
Could?

292
00:14:01,905 --> 00:14:02,905
Will.

293
00:14:04,073 --> 00:14:05,407
Will change.

294
00:14:06,776 --> 00:14:08,744
What about
proprietary rights?

295
00:14:08,745 --> 00:14:10,445
Ours and ours alone.

296
00:14:10,446 --> 00:14:12,080
We fund it.
We own it.

297
00:14:12,081 --> 00:14:13,782
We do with it
as we please.

298
00:14:13,783 --> 00:14:15,617
The credit, however...

299
00:14:15,618 --> 00:14:17,619
it's all yours,

300
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:19,388
along with a great
deal of money.

301
00:14:21,424 --> 00:14:22,991
I'll need full autonomy,

302
00:14:22,992 --> 00:14:24,993
over my staff, the lab,

303
00:14:24,994 --> 00:14:25,994
our process...

304
00:14:25,995 --> 00:14:27,229
Not a problem.

305
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:29,565
You're the horse
we're backing, Edwin.

306
00:14:29,566 --> 00:14:31,466
And we're willing
to bet big.

307
00:14:34,537 --> 00:14:37,673
As soon as we process
you through security,

308
00:14:37,674 --> 00:14:39,541
we'll meet with Dr. James,

309
00:14:39,542 --> 00:14:42,778
get a progress report
on the search for Edwin.

310
00:14:43,913 --> 00:14:45,480
How are you feeling?

311
00:14:45,481 --> 00:14:49,151
Afraid. Afraid that coming
back here was a bad idea.

312
00:14:54,757 --> 00:14:55,958
Don't take that off.

313
00:14:55,959 --> 00:14:58,594
That'll give you access
to most of the compound.

314
00:14:58,595 --> 00:15:00,963
Things have definitely
changed around here.

315
00:15:00,964 --> 00:15:03,932
I remember when security used
to be your dad's hunting dogs.

316
00:15:03,933 --> 00:15:06,835
Unfortunately, we're
learning the hard way

317
00:15:06,836 --> 00:15:08,904
that even all this
isn't enough.

318
00:15:10,073 --> 00:15:11,840
So, Brody...

319
00:15:11,841 --> 00:15:13,642
since your folks
haven't told you

320
00:15:13,643 --> 00:15:15,043
about the Jensen Project,

321
00:15:15,044 --> 00:15:16,278
I'll bring you
up to speed

322
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:17,713
on our way to
meet Dr. James.

323
00:15:17,714 --> 00:15:20,182
OK. Cool.

324
00:15:20,183 --> 00:15:21,650
The Jensen Project

325
00:15:21,651 --> 00:15:24,119
is one of the premier research
facilities in the world.

326
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,655
It was founded by my father,
the late William Jensen.

327
00:15:26,656 --> 00:15:29,024
The Project is
a collective of great minds

328
00:15:29,025 --> 00:15:32,494
who not only theorize about
ways to improve the world

329
00:15:32,495 --> 00:15:34,262
but actually do it.

330
00:15:34,263 --> 00:15:37,132
These are just a few of our
more successful projects.

331
00:15:37,133 --> 00:15:39,001
Yeah, but you
didn't get credit.

332
00:15:39,002 --> 00:15:40,168
Other people did.

333
00:15:40,169 --> 00:15:42,571
If the group develops,
say, a new vaccine,

334
00:15:42,572 --> 00:15:44,940
it's given to
an organization like the CDC

335
00:15:44,941 --> 00:15:46,775
or the World
Health Organization.

336
00:15:46,776 --> 00:15:48,744
They get
the magazine covers.

337
00:15:48,745 --> 00:15:51,179
At Jensen,
the work is the reward.

338
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,848
Ingrid, status report.

339
00:15:52,849 --> 00:15:54,282
Kendrick James.

340
00:15:54,283 --> 00:15:56,952
This is Brody,
Matt and Claire Thompson.

341
00:15:56,953 --> 00:15:58,120
He's the head of

342
00:15:58,121 --> 00:16:00,389
the Photonic and Acoustical
Engineering Department

343
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:01,757
and our security chief.

344
00:16:01,758 --> 00:16:03,125
Glad you're here.

345
00:16:03,126 --> 00:16:05,527
So far we've got
27 pieces of missing tech.

346
00:16:05,528 --> 00:16:08,263
And counting!
It is worse than we thought.

347
00:16:08,264 --> 00:16:11,633
Biomedical Neuro-cog
and Robotics were tapped.

348
00:16:11,634 --> 00:16:14,636
Ginny, these are
the Thompsons.

349
00:16:14,637 --> 00:16:15,937
Hi. And bye.

350
00:16:15,938 --> 00:16:17,739
I gotta go see
if they also hit AI.

351
00:16:19,809 --> 00:16:21,576
Welcome back to Jensen.

352
00:16:23,146 --> 00:16:26,081
Ginny heads up our
Computer Sciences division.

353
00:16:26,082 --> 00:16:28,817
Let's get to it before
things get worse than they are.

354
00:16:28,818 --> 00:16:30,919
There's no telling
how far Edwin's gone.

355
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:34,089
- Oh, what about me?
- Free to roam the premises.

356
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:36,058
Stay out of trouble.

357
00:16:38,528 --> 00:16:39,861
No worries.

358
00:16:44,667 --> 00:16:46,468

368
00:17:11,694 --> 00:17:14,863
We know that more than
a billion people worldwide

369
00:17:14,864 --> 00:17:16,565
are without access
to clean water.

370
00:17:16,566 --> 00:17:17,899
And as a result,

371
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:20,102
more than 4,000 children
in developing countries

372
00:17:20,103 --> 00:17:21,503
die every single day.

373
00:17:21,504 --> 00:17:23,939
So we created this
helpful little invention

374
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:26,174
and gave it to
the good people at Pur.

375
00:17:27,376 --> 00:17:29,711
It usually takes
half an hour in a strainer,

376
00:17:29,712 --> 00:17:31,313
but we'll speed
things up here.

377
00:17:35,017 --> 00:17:36,318
And there you have it!

378
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:38,653
Potentially deadly water
is now clean

379
00:17:38,654 --> 00:17:40,322
and ready to drink.

380
00:17:41,891 --> 00:17:45,460
The uses are infinite.
Non-toxic, water soluble.

381
00:17:46,796 --> 00:17:50,165
It can be used to heal
a bloody wound during battle

382
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:52,801
or seal a leak
on the space shuttle.

Whoa!

412
00:19:13,549 --> 00:19:15,650
Has anyone gone through
Edwin's stuff?

413
00:19:15,651 --> 00:19:17,018
What little
he left behind

414
00:19:17,019 --> 00:19:18,920
was in his
incomprehensible shorthand.

415
00:19:18,921 --> 00:19:21,723
It's based on an algorithm.
I helped him create it.

416
00:19:21,724 --> 00:19:23,358
I was so hoping
you'd say that!

417
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:25,126
Sounds like he took
a lot of tech.

418
00:19:25,127 --> 00:19:27,162
Are you sure he's
focusing on nanobots?

419
00:19:27,163 --> 00:19:29,931
No, but based on our last
conversation, I'm guessing.

420
00:19:29,932 --> 00:19:32,434
Certainly the most
high-profile.

421
00:19:32,435 --> 00:19:34,502
And unfortunately,
the most dangerous.

422
00:19:34,503 --> 00:19:37,239
But he wasn't able to take
our molecular assembler.

423
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,406
Your what?

424
00:19:38,407 --> 00:19:40,375
He can't produce
nanobots without it.

425
00:19:40,376 --> 00:19:41,776
And besides ours,

426
00:19:41,777 --> 00:19:44,079
there's only a few others
in the entire world.

427
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,615
Well, I guess we should
roll up our sleeves.

428
00:19:46,616 --> 00:19:48,984
I'm going to need
all of Edwin's old files.

429
00:19:48,985 --> 00:19:50,452
I'll send them right away.

430
00:19:50,453 --> 00:19:52,120
You can work over here
at his desk.

431
00:19:52,121 --> 00:19:54,155
Who's running
Immunology these days?

432
00:19:54,156 --> 00:19:56,258
You are.
At least for now.

433
00:19:56,259 --> 00:19:58,860
Our department head
took off with Edwin.

434
00:19:58,861 --> 00:20:00,128
Can I access
lab records?

435
00:20:00,129 --> 00:20:02,764
Absolutely. Come on.
I'll walk with you.

436
00:20:09,739 --> 00:20:11,172
Monitor.

437
00:20:11,173 --> 00:20:12,841
Open files.

438
00:20:19,882 --> 00:20:21,449
Next file.

439
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:24,152
I can't tell you
how much it means to me

440
00:20:24,153 --> 00:20:26,388
to have both of you
back here again.

441
00:20:26,389 --> 00:20:28,256
This wasn't easy,
you know,

442
00:20:28,257 --> 00:20:30,992
for Claire, I mean, not after
Edwin forced her to leave.

443
00:20:30,993 --> 00:20:32,127
I can imagine.

444
00:20:32,128 --> 00:20:34,396
You two ever talk about
the time you spent here?

445
00:20:34,397 --> 00:20:37,232
That's a subject that's been
pretty much off limits

446
00:20:37,233 --> 00:20:38,433
for a long time.

447
00:20:38,434 --> 00:20:41,536
Matt, I tried, actually,
to stand up to Edwin

448
00:20:41,537 --> 00:20:42,804
on Claire's behalf,

449
00:20:42,805 --> 00:20:44,873
but he was
absolutely adamant.

450
00:20:44,874 --> 00:20:46,841
His behavior
that day was...

451
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:49,811
In retrospect,
it marked a change in him

452
00:20:49,812 --> 00:20:51,513
that continued
until the day he left.

453
00:20:53,082 --> 00:20:56,484
This is something you should
talk to Claire about,

454
00:20:56,485 --> 00:20:57,485
not me.

455
00:21:02,224 --> 00:21:04,592
Based on the list
you gave me,

456
00:21:04,593 --> 00:21:07,529
we've provided all the lab
equipment and installs.

457
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:09,331
There's just one
piece of equipment

458
00:21:09,332 --> 00:21:10,598
we weren't
able to find.

459
00:21:10,599 --> 00:21:11,967
The molecular assembler.

460
00:21:11,968 --> 00:21:13,802
But my people
are working on that.

461
00:21:13,803 --> 00:21:16,104
Well, the sooner we
get our hands on one,

462
00:21:16,105 --> 00:21:18,306
the sooner I can start
producing nanobots.

463
00:21:31,954 --> 00:21:33,755
So what do you think?

464
00:21:36,926 --> 00:21:38,226
I think...

465
00:21:40,262 --> 00:21:41,596
...it's perfect!

466
00:21:41,597 --> 00:21:43,198
Excellent!

467
00:21:44,266 --> 00:21:47,235
Then I'll leave you
so you can get started.

468
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:06,121
Hello?

469
00:23:18,494 --> 00:23:19,794
Hello?

470
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:30,705
Oh, now,
this is beyond cool!

471
00:23:30,706 --> 00:23:32,207
Huh?

472
00:23:32,208 --> 00:23:33,842
Whoa!

473
00:23:38,768 --> 00:23:41,003
<i>You are in violation</i>
<i>of statute 387564,</i>

474
00:23:41,004 --> 00:23:42,371
<i>breaking and entering!</i>

475
00:23:42,372 --> 00:23:44,273
No, no, I was just

476
00:23:44,274 --> 00:23:46,742
- <i>You hacked my security!</i>
<i>- You call that security?</i>

477
00:23:46,743 --> 00:23:48,577
<i>Uh, yeah!</i>
<i>I built it myself!</i>

478
00:23:48,578 --> 00:23:51,879
And I cracked it myself,
like, in 2 seconds!

479
00:23:51,982 --> 00:23:54,517
<i>Well, you're the one</i>
<i>hanging upside down!</i>

480
00:23:54,518 --> 00:23:56,186
- You ambushed me!
- <i>Who are you?</i>

481
00:23:56,187 --> 00:23:57,954
- Who are you?
- <i>I asked you first!</i>

482
00:23:57,955 --> 00:24:00,023
Look, just let me down,
and I promise--

483
00:24:00,024 --> 00:24:01,624
<i>Save it for the authorities!</i>

484
00:24:01,625 --> 00:24:04,360
No! No! Please! Come on!
Just don't call the cops!

485
00:24:04,361 --> 00:24:05,562
No! My mom would freak!

486
00:24:05,563 --> 00:24:07,630
- <i>Your parents know you're here?</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

487
00:24:07,631 --> 00:24:09,232
They're here, too.

488
00:24:09,233 --> 00:24:12,001
My mom used to work here
and so did my dad.

489
00:24:12,002 --> 00:24:13,837
- <i>No way!</i>
<i>- Oh yeah, for real!</i>

490
00:24:13,838 --> 00:24:15,271
Matthew and Claire Thompson.

491
00:24:15,272 --> 00:24:18,975
<i>You're Matt and</i>
<i>Claire Thompson's kid?</i>

492
00:24:18,976 --> 00:24:20,310
Well, then...

493
00:24:20,311 --> 00:24:22,645
you must be smarter
than you look!

494
00:24:24,982 --> 00:24:26,449
Next file.

495
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:27,751
Next.

496
00:24:28,986 --> 00:24:30,787
Stop.

497
00:24:33,324 --> 00:24:34,524
Notes.

498
00:24:40,164 --> 00:24:41,998
Transfer file to tablet.

499
00:24:45,402 --> 00:24:46,770
Com.

500
00:24:46,771 --> 00:24:48,037
Kendrick.

501
00:24:48,038 --> 00:24:49,272
<i>Yes, Claire?</i>

502
00:24:50,574 --> 00:24:53,610
I found a notation
in one of Edwin's files.

503
00:24:53,611 --> 00:24:54,778
It's signed "NP."

504
00:24:54,779 --> 00:24:56,746
Any idea who that might be?

505
00:24:56,747 --> 00:24:59,549
The most obnoxious,
egocentric individual

506
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:01,851
I've ever encountered.

507
00:25:01,852 --> 00:25:04,854
I'm not at all surprised
that Edwin's up and left.

508
00:25:04,855 --> 00:25:05,955
Good riddance!

509
00:25:05,956 --> 00:25:07,657
I take it you two
butted heads.

510
00:25:07,658 --> 00:25:08,892
Ah! Endlessly!

511
00:25:08,893 --> 00:25:10,727
Edwin made it
his personal goal

512
00:25:10,728 --> 00:25:13,263
to belittle my contributions
to the team.

513
00:25:13,264 --> 00:25:15,799
I certainly know
what that feels like.

514
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,300
So I've heard.

515
00:25:17,301 --> 00:25:19,235
Let's sit, shall we?

516
00:25:21,472 --> 00:25:23,006
Tablet on.

517
00:25:23,007 --> 00:25:25,642
I found this diagram
of a prosthesis.

518
00:25:25,643 --> 00:25:27,577
It has your initials on it.

519
00:25:27,578 --> 00:25:30,313
No Jensen project can move
from a theoretical stage

520
00:25:30,314 --> 00:25:31,781
to a practical application

521
00:25:31,782 --> 00:25:34,050
without a thorough
investigation from my team.

522
00:25:34,051 --> 00:25:36,553
The Ethics department,
which I head,

523
00:25:36,554 --> 00:25:39,856
weighs the implications
of all new technology:

524
00:25:39,857 --> 00:25:42,091
ethical, moral, philosophical.

525
00:25:42,092 --> 00:25:43,593
What about the prosthesis?

526
00:25:43,594 --> 00:25:45,128
He wanted to
use nanotechnology

527
00:25:45,129 --> 00:25:46,729
to remotely control
the prosthetic

528
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:49,432
through an interface with
nerve remnants in the stump.

529
00:25:49,433 --> 00:25:52,468
But it caused too much
pain for the subject.

530
00:25:52,469 --> 00:25:54,971
Edwin thought the ends
justified the means.

531
00:25:54,972 --> 00:25:58,007
So control the prosthetic,
he would control everything:

532
00:25:58,008 --> 00:26:00,510
the subject's body functions,
brain functions...

533
00:26:00,511 --> 00:26:02,579
- Precisely.
- Tablet off.

534
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:05,682
That's why Ingrid
tabled his research.

535
00:26:05,683 --> 00:26:08,985
He appealed to me, but once
Ingrid makes up her mind...

536
00:26:08,986 --> 00:26:10,687
Hard to get her
to change it.

537
00:26:10,688 --> 00:26:11,921
Been there, done that.

538
00:26:13,224 --> 00:26:15,458
Despite the
bioethical concerns,

539
00:26:15,459 --> 00:26:18,261
Edwin was onto something
quite remarkable.

540
00:26:18,262 --> 00:26:20,530
From what I understand,

541
00:26:20,531 --> 00:26:24,601
his work was a continuation
of the tech you invented.

542
00:26:24,602 --> 00:26:26,169
- Who told you that?
- Edwin.

543
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:28,137
He said if you
hadn't mishandled it,

544
00:26:28,138 --> 00:26:30,273
your work would have
been foundational.

545
00:26:30,274 --> 00:26:31,875
Hmm!

546
00:27:00,905 --> 00:27:03,907
I perfected
the nanobot ciliary mechanism.

547
00:27:03,908 --> 00:27:04,908
Look!

548
00:27:11,749 --> 00:27:15,652
It's remarkable,
and you are amazing!

549
00:27:20,524 --> 00:27:22,358
If only you had worked...

550
00:27:26,397 --> 00:27:29,399
Good news!
We found our assembler!

551
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:32,268
- Where?
- Laboratoire TechGen.

552
00:27:32,269 --> 00:27:35,204
In Montreal? I'm surprised
they'd actually sell theirs.

553
00:27:35,205 --> 00:27:37,640
Well, they won't.
You'll help Ken retrieve it.

554
00:27:37,641 --> 00:27:39,042
You're wheels up
in 2 hours.

555
00:27:40,444 --> 00:27:42,211
I--I don't understand.

556
00:27:42,212 --> 00:27:43,780
It's simple, Edwin.

557
00:27:43,781 --> 00:27:47,350
Ken and his team will
break into the laboratory,

558
00:27:47,351 --> 00:27:49,852
and you'll identify
the assembler.

559
00:27:49,853 --> 00:27:51,688
And steal it?

560
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,260
You're crazy!

561
00:27:58,329 --> 00:27:59,829
I'm not gonna do that.

562
00:28:01,031 --> 00:28:03,232
You'll do it, Edwin.
Trust me.

563
00:28:03,233 --> 00:28:06,169
The people who've paid
for all this...

564
00:28:06,170 --> 00:28:08,104
won't take no
for an answer.

565
00:28:17,915 --> 00:28:19,782
Look, I didn't know
who you were.

566
00:28:19,783 --> 00:28:21,784
Some random stranger
cracking my space.

567
00:28:21,785 --> 00:28:23,920
For all I knew,
Edwin could've sent you.

568
00:28:23,921 --> 00:28:25,822
We are operating
at DEFCON 5.

569
00:28:25,823 --> 00:28:28,291
You hung me from the rafters
like a smoked ham.

570
00:28:28,292 --> 00:28:30,360
And I'd do it again.

571
00:28:35,866 --> 00:28:36,933
What's that?

572
00:28:36,934 --> 00:28:38,634
- My orb.
- Your what?

573
00:28:38,635 --> 00:28:41,738
It's what they give you
when you become an apprentice.

574
00:28:41,739 --> 00:28:44,173
So what's an apprentice do?

575
00:28:44,174 --> 00:28:46,809
Every 6 months I rotate
to a new department

576
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:48,311
until I pick a specialty.

577
00:28:48,312 --> 00:28:51,214
Right now, I'm with Dr. James
in Acoustical Engineering.

578
00:28:51,215 --> 00:28:53,716
Wow! I usually
have to ditch class

579
00:28:53,717 --> 00:28:56,219
in order to do
something that cool.

580
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:58,621
So where are your parents?

581
00:28:58,622 --> 00:28:59,956
Gone.

582
00:29:05,963 --> 00:29:07,497
Why did Edwin leave?

583
00:29:07,498 --> 00:29:09,132
You ask a lot
of question, dude.

584
00:29:09,133 --> 00:29:11,467
- It's Brody.
- Whatever, dude.

585
00:29:14,138 --> 00:29:15,705
Oh!

586
00:29:20,844 --> 00:29:22,078
So what did he take?

587
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:24,514
Out of the loop
on that one.

588
00:29:24,515 --> 00:29:25,915
When I asked Ingrid,

589
00:29:25,916 --> 00:29:28,151
she said there are things
I don't need to know.

590
00:29:28,152 --> 00:29:29,652
That was a first.

591
00:29:29,653 --> 00:29:31,521
Never pulled
a "'cause I said so" card.

592
00:29:31,522 --> 00:29:34,624
Lucky you! That's pretty much
the only card in my mom's deck!

593
00:29:34,625 --> 00:29:36,192
It's not cool!

594
00:29:36,193 --> 00:29:39,729
Them keeping stuff from me,
it's like, hello?

595
00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:42,131
If you're not gonna be straight,
what's the point?

596
00:29:42,132 --> 00:29:43,833
How we supposed to
help each other?

597
00:29:43,834 --> 00:29:45,401
Well, don't spaz over it.

598
00:29:45,402 --> 00:29:48,004
I mean, in my family, we never
share anything important.

599
00:29:48,005 --> 00:29:49,705
Gotcha!

600
00:30:09,493 --> 00:30:10,493
Follow me.

601
00:30:28,779 --> 00:30:30,313
This way.

602
00:31:03,313 --> 00:31:05,114
Over here.

603
00:31:08,285 --> 00:31:09,418
Down! Get down!

604
00:31:28,805 --> 00:31:29,972
Come on!

605
00:31:29,973 --> 00:31:31,507
Let's go! Let's go!

606
00:31:35,579 --> 00:31:36,612
Go! Go! Go! Go!

607
00:31:49,826 --> 00:31:51,060
Anything?

608
00:31:53,931 --> 00:31:55,865
Crones disease,
Hodgkin's lymphoma,

609
00:31:55,866 --> 00:31:56,933
sickle-cell anemia.

610
00:31:56,934 --> 00:31:58,734
Edwin's been doing
backdoor studies

611
00:31:58,735 --> 00:32:00,136
on all of them
for months.

612
00:32:00,137 --> 00:32:01,470
Fits with
Ingrid's theory

613
00:32:01,471 --> 00:32:03,439
that he's focusing
on nano-med technology.

614
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,507
Module up.

615
00:32:04,508 --> 00:32:06,576
Research facilities
all over the world

616
00:32:06,577 --> 00:32:08,077
put it at least
15 years away.

617
00:32:08,078 --> 00:32:10,980
Honey, have you forgotten
where we are?

618
00:32:10,981 --> 00:32:13,416
This the place
where nanotech--

619
00:32:13,417 --> 00:32:15,551
Funny how all
conversation ceases

620
00:32:15,552 --> 00:32:17,053
when we walk
into a room.

621
00:32:17,054 --> 00:32:18,521
And you are?

622
00:32:18,522 --> 00:32:21,891
Samantha Cortez, the youngest
apprentice in Jensen history.

623
00:32:21,892 --> 00:32:23,226
Pleasure's all mine.

624
00:32:23,227 --> 00:32:25,328
Did you know
your dad, like,

625
00:32:25,329 --> 00:32:27,697
invented the treatment
for macular degeneration?

626
00:32:27,698 --> 00:32:29,565
You never told me.

627
00:32:29,566 --> 00:32:31,000
Ah, old news.

628
00:32:31,001 --> 00:32:34,170
- Where'd you find Ms. Cortez?
- Hotwiring my car.

629
00:32:34,171 --> 00:32:35,671
I caught her red-handed.

630
00:32:35,672 --> 00:32:38,574
But when I warned her
that it was impossible

631
00:32:38,575 --> 00:32:40,476
because of
its computerization

632
00:32:40,477 --> 00:32:42,445
she bet me.

633
00:32:42,446 --> 00:32:43,646
And I won.

634
00:32:43,647 --> 00:32:45,648
You have a knack
for finding sharp ones.

635
00:32:45,649 --> 00:32:48,351
Is everything
a holograph around here?

636
00:32:48,352 --> 00:32:51,687
Looks like an early design
for a mobility module,

637
00:32:51,688 --> 00:32:53,823
from, like,
the '50s or something.

638
00:32:53,824 --> 00:32:55,057
Try mid '90s!

639
00:32:55,058 --> 00:32:58,160
This is the neural network.
The brains.

640
00:32:58,161 --> 00:33:01,764
You can communicate with the
nanobot remotely via computer.

641
00:33:01,765 --> 00:33:04,500
This is the mobility module.
This is the delivery device.

642
00:33:04,501 --> 00:33:06,902
For hormones,
vaccines, fluids.

643
00:33:06,903 --> 00:33:09,438
This has to be the greatest
medical invention ever!

644
00:33:09,439 --> 00:33:10,539
Or the worst weapon.

645
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:12,174
This why everyone's
freaked out?

646
00:33:12,175 --> 00:33:14,110
Because Edwin boosted
one of these?

647
00:33:14,111 --> 00:33:16,279
- Yes.
- What's he gonna do with it?

648
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:18,014
Well, he hasn't
got funding,

649
00:33:18,015 --> 00:33:20,416
so I guess he's looking
for an investor.

650
00:33:20,417 --> 00:33:22,718
You mean selling it
to the highest bidder.

651
00:33:22,719 --> 00:33:25,154
Edwin can't do
anything without--

652
00:33:25,155 --> 00:33:26,722
A molecular assembler.

653
00:33:26,723 --> 00:33:28,257
Three men stole one
in Montreal

654
00:33:28,258 --> 00:33:29,759
90 minutes ago.

655
00:33:37,243 --> 00:33:40,145
Look, I don't get why we can't
help find Edwin, Dr. James.

656
00:33:40,146 --> 00:33:42,847
I know! We can bring a fresh
perspective to the search!

657
00:33:42,848 --> 00:33:45,717
Yeah, "fresh" being the
operative word in your case.

658
00:33:45,718 --> 00:33:46,985
Huh?

659
00:33:48,187 --> 00:33:49,487
I know you guys
wanna help,

660
00:33:49,488 --> 00:33:51,356
but this has become
serious business.

661
00:33:51,357 --> 00:33:53,992
And, Brody, the last thing
your parents need right now

662
00:33:53,993 --> 00:33:55,527
is to be worrying
about you.

663
00:33:55,528 --> 00:33:57,262
Now, I've gotta
get back to HQ.

664
00:33:57,263 --> 00:33:59,898
Sam, why don't you take
Brody down to my lab.

665
00:33:59,899 --> 00:34:01,900
Show him what we've
been working on.

666
00:34:04,694 --> 00:34:06,094
Come on, dude.

667
00:34:07,363 --> 00:34:08,363
It's Brody!

668
00:34:09,799 --> 00:34:12,000
<i>Welcome, Dr. Kendrick.</i>

669
00:34:12,001 --> 00:34:13,702
Here we go.

670
00:34:13,703 --> 00:34:16,672
Found footage of the break-in
at the TechGen lab.

671
00:34:19,075 --> 00:34:20,976
Look at that image.

672
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:24,646
That's Edwin, all right!

673
00:34:26,516 --> 00:34:27,683
So that's it?

674
00:34:27,684 --> 00:34:29,852
Yup, the infamous
molecular assembler.

675
00:34:29,853 --> 00:34:31,420
It's too bad
a computer image

676
00:34:31,421 --> 00:34:34,590
is as close as we're ever gonna
get to one of those babies.

677
00:34:37,427 --> 00:34:39,228
So why does
Dr. James wear

678
00:34:39,229 --> 00:34:41,964
both a science hat
and a security hat?

679
00:34:41,965 --> 00:34:43,932
He's got the creds.

680
00:34:43,933 --> 00:34:45,467
Worked for the NSA
for 10 years

681
00:34:45,468 --> 00:34:47,836
before Ingrid invited him
to join the Project.

682
00:34:49,372 --> 00:34:51,273
What's that?

683
00:34:51,274 --> 00:34:52,608
Just an experiment.

684
00:34:52,609 --> 00:34:54,910
I'm tinkering with
sound-frequency isolation.

685
00:34:54,911 --> 00:34:56,044
Interesting.

686
00:34:57,380 --> 00:35:00,249
This is what Dr. James
wanted me to show you:

687
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:01,483
a voice-tracking device.

688
00:35:01,484 --> 00:35:02,851
You mean, like a bug?

689
00:35:02,852 --> 00:35:05,654
Except it matches voice
patterns to digital signals

690
00:35:05,655 --> 00:35:06,788
over satellite feeds.

691
00:35:06,789 --> 00:35:07,890
That's awesome!

692
00:35:07,891 --> 00:35:09,157
The way it is now,

693
00:35:09,158 --> 00:35:10,926
you need to know where
a signal originates

694
00:35:10,927 --> 00:35:11,994
or where it's going,

695
00:35:11,995 --> 00:35:13,428
but not with this.

696
00:35:13,429 --> 00:35:16,832
So if we were to track the
sound wave of someone's voice,

697
00:35:16,833 --> 00:35:18,667
we can figure out
their location.

698
00:35:18,668 --> 00:35:21,737
If there's a phone in the room
with the person we're tracking,

699
00:35:21,738 --> 00:35:23,906
we can hear them through
the phone's speaker.

700
00:35:23,907 --> 00:35:25,807
Even if the phone's
turned off?

701
00:35:25,808 --> 00:35:28,810
Off, on, in a pocket.
It doesn't matter. Watch.

702
00:35:28,811 --> 00:35:30,879
I'll upload voice patters
of your parents

703
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,180
from some old files.

704
00:35:32,181 --> 00:35:34,950
And the software will search
the ozone to find a match...

705
00:35:36,519 --> 00:35:38,620
and identify
the sight of origin.

706
00:35:38,621 --> 00:35:39,788
That's so cool!

707
00:35:40,790 --> 00:35:42,257
I'll tap into
security feeds

708
00:35:42,258 --> 00:35:44,293
at airports and major
border crossings.

709
00:35:44,294 --> 00:35:46,395
- Perfect.
- We can use the bio passport.

710
00:35:46,396 --> 00:35:47,896
To track Edwin?

711
00:35:47,897 --> 00:35:51,066
Yes. Everything-- cars,
people, machinery-- leaves a...

712
00:35:51,067 --> 00:35:53,101
- Chemical signature.
- Like a trail.

713
00:35:53,102 --> 00:35:54,770
I can mod the
bio-passport tech

714
00:35:54,771 --> 00:35:57,039
I developed
on the Nicaragua dig

715
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,807
to trace the
molecular assembler.

716
00:35:58,808 --> 00:36:00,509
Use the Montreal
transit system...

717
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:02,644
- Exacta-mundo!
- Take it out of shorthand.

718
00:36:02,645 --> 00:36:06,381
After 9/11, every major city
installed chemical detectors

719
00:36:06,382 --> 00:36:08,183
in their
public-transit systems

720
00:36:08,184 --> 00:36:11,253
to pick up trace elements
of hazardous materials,

721
00:36:11,254 --> 00:36:12,254
like anthrax.

722
00:36:12,255 --> 00:36:14,189
Combine that with
a bio passport,

723
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:16,024
and you can follow
a chemical trail

724
00:36:16,025 --> 00:36:17,826
to the assembler
that Edwin stole.

725
00:36:17,827 --> 00:36:19,828
So drum roll.
What am I looking for?

726
00:36:19,829 --> 00:36:21,830
- Silicon.
- I need something else

727
00:36:21,831 --> 00:36:23,365
to mix into the cocktail.

728
00:36:23,366 --> 00:36:26,201
Solvents. Molecular assemblers
use solvents to etch gold--

729
00:36:26,202 --> 00:36:28,503
- Ah! You said gold!
- It's used as a conductor.

730
00:36:28,504 --> 00:36:30,005
Well, that's all I need.

731
00:36:30,006 --> 00:36:32,808
We're looking for a breadcrumb
trail of gold and silicon.

732
00:36:32,809 --> 00:36:35,110
There's a California joke
in there somewhere.

733
00:36:39,482 --> 00:36:41,717
Edwin! How was
your field trip?

734
00:36:42,819 --> 00:36:44,920
- Terrifying.
- Well, but successful.

735
00:36:44,921 --> 00:36:46,388
Well, we won't know

736
00:36:46,389 --> 00:36:49,758
until I get the assembler into
a clean room and run some tests.

737
00:36:49,759 --> 00:36:52,060
Then we'll see
if it was damaged

738
00:36:52,061 --> 00:36:56,298
while I was being chased down
an alley like a common thief!

739
00:37:00,637 --> 00:37:03,205
<i>As soon as</i>
<i>we pinpoint his location,</i>

740
00:37:03,206 --> 00:37:04,840
we need a team ready to go.

741
00:37:04,841 --> 00:37:06,975
Sounds like the computer
found my parents.

742
00:37:06,976 --> 00:37:08,577
They're trying
to find Edwin.

743
00:37:08,578 --> 00:37:10,846
So the computer
found my folks.

744
00:37:10,847 --> 00:37:12,514
Can it find Edwin, too?

745
00:37:12,515 --> 00:37:14,549
Mmm... unlikely.

746
00:37:15,952 --> 00:37:18,787
How about if we hook up
my gear to yours?

747
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:21,657
Worth a try.

748
00:37:21,658 --> 00:37:23,959
Let me pull a voice sample.

749
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,861
No, on second thought...

750
00:37:26,896 --> 00:37:28,196
What?

751
00:37:28,197 --> 00:37:29,931
Maybe we should
just chill.

752
00:37:29,932 --> 00:37:31,867
What do you mean, chill?

753
00:37:31,868 --> 00:37:33,535
My parents would freak.

754
00:37:33,536 --> 00:37:34,736
We're trying to help.

755
00:37:34,737 --> 00:37:36,638
But they already
told us not to and--

756
00:37:36,639 --> 00:37:37,806
And what?

757
00:37:39,108 --> 00:37:41,109
They just busted me
for ditching school

758
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:42,444
for, like,
the fourth time.

759
00:37:42,445 --> 00:37:44,413
You don't like school?

760
00:37:44,414 --> 00:37:46,748
Not so much, no.

761
00:37:48,217 --> 00:37:49,384
Too easy?

762
00:37:52,355 --> 00:37:54,022
I had the same problem.

763
00:37:54,023 --> 00:37:58,126
But instead of ditching,
I kept getting tossed out.

764
00:37:58,127 --> 00:37:59,661
You talk
to them about it?

765
00:38:01,130 --> 00:38:02,130
What?

766
00:38:02,131 --> 00:38:03,865
They wouldn't understand.

767
00:38:03,866 --> 00:38:07,102
How could they if you
don't explain it to them?

768
00:38:15,311 --> 00:38:16,712
Camomile.

769
00:38:16,713 --> 00:38:17,713
Thank you.

770
00:38:17,714 --> 00:38:19,081
Calm your nerves.

771
00:38:19,082 --> 00:38:21,283
I keep thinking none of this
would have happened

772
00:38:21,284 --> 00:38:23,485
if I'd listened to you
in the first place.

773
00:38:23,486 --> 00:38:26,088
No one could have predicted
Edwin would go this far.

774
00:38:26,089 --> 00:38:27,255
Got something here.

775
00:38:27,256 --> 00:38:28,323
A private jet

776
00:38:28,324 --> 00:38:30,258
left a Montreal airstrip

777
00:38:30,259 --> 00:38:31,827
at 9:30 last night.

778
00:38:31,828 --> 00:38:33,028
At that altitude,

779
00:38:33,029 --> 00:38:35,530
the chemical trail
will be Gonzo by now.

780
00:38:35,531 --> 00:38:37,632
But if we can figure out
where it landed,

781
00:38:37,633 --> 00:38:39,401
chances are it'll
lead us to Edwin.

782
00:38:51,681 --> 00:38:54,015
Just got a text from
my guy at Homeland Security.

783
00:38:54,016 --> 00:38:56,551
He said the plane from Montreal
landed in New Jersey.

784
00:38:56,552 --> 00:39:00,522
On it. I'll target New York,
Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware.

785
00:39:00,523 --> 00:39:02,724
I think
I've got something.

786
00:39:02,725 --> 00:39:05,527
Trace elements
of gold and silicon.

787
00:39:05,528 --> 00:39:07,062
That's our cocktail!

788
00:39:07,063 --> 00:39:09,297
OK, backtracking
them to...

789
00:39:11,868 --> 00:39:14,903
Isolate that right there.
You see it?

790
00:39:14,904 --> 00:39:16,972
Mm-hmm.
That's New York.

791
00:39:16,973 --> 00:39:18,707
The Bronx, actually.

792
00:39:18,708 --> 00:39:20,809
Where in the Bronx?

793
00:39:23,279 --> 00:39:25,147
Van Cortlandt Park.

794
00:39:32,622 --> 00:39:35,857
OK, connect this
to Dr. James' receiver.

795
00:39:38,094 --> 00:39:40,896
- Check.
- And...

796
00:39:40,897 --> 00:39:42,731
That should do it.

797
00:39:42,732 --> 00:39:44,699
<i>All department heads,</i>
<i>report to HQ.</i>

798
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:46,434
What's happening?

799
00:39:46,435 --> 00:39:48,303
Only one way to find out!

800
00:39:56,946 --> 00:39:59,514
You think that's a good idea,
calling them in?

801
00:39:59,515 --> 00:40:02,217
- It's Jensen protocol.
- Half of them have mutinied!

802
00:40:02,218 --> 00:40:04,586
You can't know who's still
in touch with Edwin.

803
00:40:04,587 --> 00:40:05,754
It'll be need-to-know.

804
00:40:05,755 --> 00:40:07,489
Most of our security
is electronic.

805
00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:10,192
We haven't needed much in
the way of boots on the ground.

806
00:40:10,193 --> 00:40:12,227
And the few we have
were handpicked.

807
00:40:12,228 --> 00:40:14,563
- And well-trained.
- Except in nanotechnology.

808
00:40:14,564 --> 00:40:16,598
I'll need to go along
to secure the data

809
00:40:16,599 --> 00:40:19,868
just in case Edwin decides,
if he can't have it, nobody can.

810
00:40:19,869 --> 00:40:21,336
Yeah, well,
if you go, I go.

811
00:40:21,337 --> 00:40:24,072
I'm concerned about
how Edwin is gonna react

812
00:40:24,073 --> 00:40:25,907
when he finds out
I brought you in.

813
00:40:25,908 --> 00:40:28,076
About what he'll do to me
or I'll do to him?

814
00:40:28,077 --> 00:40:29,911
Good point.

815
00:40:29,912 --> 00:40:31,947
I wonder if we
should've told Brody.

816
00:40:31,948 --> 00:40:34,216
No, for now I think
the less, the better.

817
00:40:34,217 --> 00:40:36,685
I guess you're right.
If he knew, he'd be...

818
00:40:36,686 --> 00:40:38,987
- As freaked out as I am?
- Hey...

819
00:40:38,988 --> 00:40:40,856
we don't have to
do this, you know.

820
00:40:40,857 --> 00:40:41,857
I think we do.

821
00:40:43,459 --> 00:40:46,061
I wish I would've known
you were such an action hero.

822
00:40:47,597 --> 00:40:49,030
I wish you'd asked.

823
00:40:53,983 --> 00:40:56,651
Mom! Dad!
Where are you going?

824
00:40:57,594 --> 00:40:59,128
Who are those guys?

825
00:40:59,129 --> 00:41:01,330
Did you find Edwin?
Are you going to get him?

826
00:41:01,331 --> 00:41:02,832
Uh, yeah.

827
00:41:02,833 --> 00:41:05,902
You were gonna do something
that crazy and not tell me?

828
00:41:05,903 --> 00:41:08,538
- We didn't want you to worry.
- That worked out well.

829
00:41:08,539 --> 00:41:10,540
The best way to keep
him from sweating it

830
00:41:10,541 --> 00:41:11,741
is to take us along.

831
00:41:11,742 --> 00:41:14,110
- This isn't a pleasure trip!
- We can help!

832
00:41:14,111 --> 00:41:15,578
You can help
by staying here.

833
00:41:15,579 --> 00:41:17,513
Folks, we gotta get going.

834
00:41:18,849 --> 00:41:19,849
I love you.

835
00:41:19,850 --> 00:41:22,652
Back before you know it.
I promise.

836
00:41:46,643 --> 00:41:49,112
Tell me you're smiling
for good reason, Edwin.

837
00:41:49,113 --> 00:41:50,713
Well, the assembler's working.

838
00:41:50,714 --> 00:41:52,949
We still have to
lay out the protocols,

839
00:41:52,950 --> 00:41:54,784
go through
sterilization techniques.

840
00:41:54,785 --> 00:41:56,152
But rest assured,

841
00:41:56,153 --> 00:41:58,654
it's nearly time
to make history.

842
00:42:04,561 --> 00:42:06,095
You got the spec yet?

843
00:42:06,096 --> 00:42:08,965
<i>It looks like</i>
<i>an abandoned water tower.</i>

844
00:42:08,966 --> 00:42:11,901
There's an entrance
on the south side.

845
00:42:11,902 --> 00:42:13,035
Security system?

846
00:42:14,638 --> 00:42:16,939
No, it doesn't look like it.

847
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:18,574
- <i>That's weird.</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

848
00:42:18,575 --> 00:42:20,343
I'll keep you posted.

849
00:42:24,314 --> 00:42:25,782
What?

850
00:42:25,783 --> 00:42:28,551
You seem so...
I don't know.

851
00:42:28,552 --> 00:42:29,786
Into this!

852
00:42:31,722 --> 00:42:34,290
Beats pulling worms
out of noses.

853
00:42:34,291 --> 00:42:35,525
What?

854
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:37,960
Nothing.

855
00:42:42,032 --> 00:42:45,134
I feel bad about leaving
Brody out of the loop.

856
00:42:45,135 --> 00:42:46,435
Me too.

857
00:42:46,436 --> 00:42:50,306
We should have talked
to him before we, you know...

858
00:42:50,307 --> 00:42:51,841
Yeah.

859
00:42:51,842 --> 00:42:54,944
Well, not talking has
become a bit of a habit.

860
00:42:58,382 --> 00:42:59,715
I can't believe them!

861
00:42:59,716 --> 00:43:02,819
They go all crazy when I don't
tell them my every move,

862
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:04,720
and they go do
something like this!

863
00:43:04,721 --> 00:43:07,456
Yeah, it's pretty
messed up, all right.

864
00:43:07,457 --> 00:43:09,826
I mean, what am I
even doing here?

865
00:43:09,827 --> 00:43:11,060
Whining. Stop it.

866
00:43:11,061 --> 00:43:12,662
Yeah, well,
what do you know?

867
00:43:14,798 --> 00:43:16,766
That if something
happens to them,

868
00:43:16,767 --> 00:43:18,968
your life will
change instantly!

869
00:43:18,969 --> 00:43:21,571
And, dude, you have
no idea what that's like!

870
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:25,408
You speaking
from experience?

871
00:43:28,312 --> 00:43:29,579
I never met my dad,

872
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:31,681
and my mom died
when I was, like, 5.

873
00:43:36,887 --> 00:43:38,087
Who raised you?

874
00:43:39,189 --> 00:43:40,456
Wolves.

875
00:43:41,491 --> 00:43:42,491
Come on.

876
00:43:42,492 --> 00:43:44,493
Foster care, group homes.

877
00:43:46,163 --> 00:43:47,496
It wasn't
so bad, actually.

878
00:43:47,497 --> 00:43:49,398
It taught me to
think and do for myself.

879
00:43:51,034 --> 00:43:52,468
So you can pout and mope,

880
00:43:52,469 --> 00:43:54,470
or we can
make something happen!

881
00:43:54,471 --> 00:43:56,439
- Like?
- Figuring out where they are.

882
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:58,541
We'll track the chopper.

883
00:44:00,744 --> 00:44:02,278
What's that?

884
00:44:02,279 --> 00:44:04,213
We left Dr. James'
program up.

885
00:44:04,214 --> 00:44:07,283
It's been searching for voice
matches to Edwin's samples...

886
00:44:07,284 --> 00:44:10,219
<i>We should have</i>
<i>a full chain in 48 hours.</i>

887
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:11,621
It's Edwin!

888
00:44:11,622 --> 00:44:13,155
- Are you sure?
- Shh! Listen!

889
00:44:13,156 --> 00:44:14,924
- <i>What am I looking at?</i>
<i>- Nanobots.</i>

890
00:44:14,925 --> 00:44:16,826
You can't see them
without a microscope,

891
00:44:16,827 --> 00:44:18,294
but trust me,

892
00:44:18,295 --> 00:44:21,163
that machine is producing
working nanobots,

893
00:44:21,164 --> 00:44:22,265
even as we speak.

894
00:44:22,266 --> 00:44:23,366
Show me.

895
00:44:23,367 --> 00:44:25,468
Show you.
Show you what?

896
00:44:25,469 --> 00:44:27,470
You said you were
producing nanobots.

897
00:44:27,471 --> 00:44:28,504
Prove it.

898
00:44:28,505 --> 00:44:30,339
Let's see one work.

899
00:44:31,341 --> 00:44:34,644
And how do you
propose I do that?

900
00:44:39,783 --> 00:44:42,018
By moving into human testing.

901
00:44:42,019 --> 00:44:43,786
Is he kidding?

902
00:44:43,787 --> 00:44:45,021
I don't think so.

903
00:44:45,022 --> 00:44:47,924
I will not do that.

904
00:44:47,925 --> 00:44:51,160
I don't think
my investors would agree.

905
00:44:52,262 --> 00:44:54,664
But if you wanna try
to convince them,

906
00:44:54,665 --> 00:44:55,698
go ahead.

907
00:44:55,699 --> 00:44:56,732
Hmm?

908
00:44:57,734 --> 00:44:59,035
Are you hearing this?

909
00:44:59,036 --> 00:45:00,903
Can you track
his cell signal?

910
00:45:00,904 --> 00:45:02,538
- I can try.
- Do it.

911
00:45:03,774 --> 00:45:05,741
I thought I heard
something over there.

912
00:45:07,744 --> 00:45:09,278
I'll go check.

913
00:45:15,485 --> 00:45:16,919
I found your mom and dad.

914
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:18,854
They're just north
of New York City,

915
00:45:18,855 --> 00:45:19,922
Van Cortlandt Park.

916
00:45:19,923 --> 00:45:22,725
- This doesn't make any sense.
- What?

917
00:45:22,726 --> 00:45:25,494
His signal is coming from
the south end of Manhattan,

918
00:45:25,495 --> 00:45:27,196
15 miles from
where they're going.

919
00:45:27,197 --> 00:45:29,098
- Double-check it.
- I did.

920
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:31,133
What's that?

921
00:45:31,134 --> 00:45:32,568
<i>System lockdown.</i>

922
00:45:32,569 --> 00:45:34,036
We're in lockdown!

923
00:45:34,037 --> 00:45:35,938
Does this mean
we lost Matt and Claire?

924
00:45:35,939 --> 00:45:37,206
Completely!

925
00:45:37,207 --> 00:45:39,542
No signals in or out!
Where are they?

926
00:45:39,543 --> 00:45:42,044
They'd just reached the site
when we lost them.

927
00:45:43,547 --> 00:45:44,981
They're on their own.

928
00:45:53,052 --> 00:45:54,820
Everyone can I have your attention?

929
00:45:55,086 --> 00:45:56,720
There's been
a security breach.

930
00:45:57,641 --> 00:45:59,876
Our network
has been compromised.

931
00:45:59,950 --> 00:46:01,451
We are in self-protect mode,

932
00:46:01,496 --> 00:46:05,566
meaning there's no outgoing
or incoming communication.

933
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:07,201
This is serious.

934
00:46:07,202 --> 00:46:09,136
<i>If our system</i>
<i>has been corrupted,</i>

935
00:46:09,137 --> 00:46:10,605
we could lose everything.

936
00:46:10,606 --> 00:46:12,707
I guess they're not
fooling around.

937
00:46:12,708 --> 00:46:14,709
A lot of our
save-the-world stuff

938
00:46:14,710 --> 00:46:17,478
is a few quick tweaks
from kill-everybody stuff,

939
00:46:17,479 --> 00:46:19,714
so yeah, we take this
pretty seriously.

940
00:46:19,715 --> 00:46:21,716
Ingrid, this is Sam!
Can you hear me?

941
00:46:23,051 --> 00:46:24,252
I can't get through.

942
00:46:24,253 --> 00:46:26,387
Someone's blocked our
com to headquarters.

943
00:46:26,388 --> 00:46:27,755
We've go to get to Ingrid!

944
00:46:27,756 --> 00:46:30,591
What about the vents?
Can't we climb through them?

945
00:46:30,592 --> 00:46:33,261
This isn't a rerun
of <i>Mission: Impossible,</i> dude!

946
00:46:33,262 --> 00:46:34,829
Grab a flashlight
and help me!

947
00:46:38,967 --> 00:46:40,401
Unh!

948
00:46:47,049 --> 00:46:48,117
How'd you know about this?

949
00:46:48,152 --> 00:46:50,854
Spilled a bag of malted
milk balls a few weeks ago.

950
00:46:50,866 --> 00:46:52,834
Couple rolled
under the machine.

951
00:46:52,835 --> 00:46:54,002
Where does it go?

952
00:46:54,003 --> 00:46:55,570
You'll see.

953
00:46:56,705 --> 00:46:58,039
Talk to me, Edwin.

954
00:46:58,040 --> 00:46:59,440
Well, right now,

955
00:46:59,441 --> 00:47:03,311
I'm regulating the patient's
blood pressure and sugar levels.

956
00:47:03,312 --> 00:47:05,179
Apparently, your man
has diabetes.

957
00:47:05,180 --> 00:47:06,481
With just a few strokes,

958
00:47:06,482 --> 00:47:08,449
I can adjust his
blood-sugar level.

959
00:47:08,450 --> 00:47:10,184
In the case of emergency,

960
00:47:10,185 --> 00:47:11,686
I could raise
his insulin

961
00:47:11,687 --> 00:47:14,355
to prevent him from
going into diabetic shock.

962
00:47:14,356 --> 00:47:16,257
Give him a shot
of serotonin.

963
00:47:16,258 --> 00:47:17,859
Slow his heart rate.

964
00:47:18,994 --> 00:47:21,596
I don't think
that's a good idea.

965
00:47:30,539 --> 00:47:33,341
There, you've seen it work.
You satisfied?

966
00:47:33,342 --> 00:47:34,342
Almost.

967
00:47:38,714 --> 00:47:41,949
Once we blast the lock,
we'll clear the room.

968
00:47:41,950 --> 00:47:43,818
Then go in
and secure the tech.

969
00:47:43,819 --> 00:47:45,153
Now, if there's
any trouble,

970
00:47:45,154 --> 00:47:47,088
I want you to
get back to the chopper.

971
00:47:53,462 --> 00:47:54,462
Hurry, dude.

972
00:48:00,069 --> 00:48:02,537
Let's do it.

973
00:48:09,745 --> 00:48:11,879
- Go! Go! Go!
- Go!

974
00:48:15,684 --> 00:48:16,718
Clear!

975
00:48:16,719 --> 00:48:19,153
- Clear!
- Clear!

976
00:48:19,154 --> 00:48:20,788
Bring 'em in!

977
00:48:28,130 --> 00:48:31,165
I don't get how the chemical
trail led my parents one way

978
00:48:31,166 --> 00:48:33,835
but the voice tracker says
Edwin's somewhere different!

979
00:48:33,836 --> 00:48:36,471
The point is, we know where
Edwin is and they don't!

980
00:48:40,275 --> 00:48:42,610
Give him a shot
of adrenaline.

981
00:48:45,914 --> 00:48:47,281
More.

982
00:48:47,282 --> 00:48:48,516
No!

983
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:53,054
Stop!

984
00:48:54,390 --> 00:48:58,226
Stop! Stop! His heart
can't take any more!

985
00:49:02,331 --> 00:49:04,365
Stop!

986
00:49:04,366 --> 00:49:07,735
You're gonna send him
into cardiac arrest!

987
00:49:17,045 --> 00:49:19,747
Don't ever say
no to me again...

988
00:49:19,748 --> 00:49:21,149
partner.

989
00:49:31,562 --> 00:49:33,698
This should lead to a vent
outside the building.

990
00:49:33,808 --> 00:49:34,308
Wait a minute.

991
00:49:34,368 --> 00:49:36,470
I thought we were trying to get to Ingrid.
Why are we going outside.

992
00:49:36,579 --> 00:49:38,381
We can't get to Ingrid
'cause of the lockdown.

993
00:49:38,489 --> 00:49:40,757
We have to switch to
plan B. Come on!

994
00:49:44,658 --> 00:49:46,559
The server's secure.

995
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:48,561
Do an all-systems
roll call,

996
00:49:48,562 --> 00:49:50,663
and try to raise
Claire and Matt.

997
00:49:51,932 --> 00:49:53,099
What is plan B?

998
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:54,167
We don't know how long

999
00:49:54,168 --> 00:49:55,902
he'll be at his
current location.

1000
00:49:55,903 --> 00:49:57,670
If we don't go now,
we might lose him.

1001
00:49:57,671 --> 00:50:00,507
Wait, plan B is going
after the guy who was just

1002
00:50:00,508 --> 00:50:03,743
testing his nano-gizmo on
a human subject by ourselves?

1003
00:50:03,744 --> 00:50:06,513
You don't have to come
if you don't want to.

1004
00:50:06,514 --> 00:50:09,015
But...

1005
00:50:09,016 --> 00:50:11,017
What's that?

1006
00:50:11,018 --> 00:50:12,919
Five propellers
and a fuselage.

1007
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:14,354
What do you think it is?

1008
00:50:14,355 --> 00:50:16,022
An airplane.

1009
00:50:16,023 --> 00:50:17,624
I knew you were
a bright kid.

1010
00:50:17,625 --> 00:50:18,958
Help me push!

1011
00:50:18,959 --> 00:50:20,460
Look...

1012
00:50:22,563 --> 00:50:24,964
do you even know how
to fly an airplane?

1013
00:50:24,965 --> 00:50:25,999
Yeah, kind of.

1014
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:26,966
Kind of?

1015
00:50:26,967 --> 00:50:28,635
No, this is not a good idea!

1016
00:50:28,636 --> 00:50:31,104
My mom would definitely
flog me for this!

1017
00:50:31,105 --> 00:50:33,373
Your call, but I'm going
with or without you.

1018
00:50:34,708 --> 00:50:37,243
Follow the pretty girl,
obey Mom...

1019
00:50:37,244 --> 00:50:39,612
Follow the pretty girl,
obey Mom...

1020
00:50:39,613 --> 00:50:43,149
Follow the pretty girl,
obey Mom... Pretty girl, Mom...

1021
00:50:53,594 --> 00:50:57,430
Dude! Are you coming or what?
Your parents need us!

1022
00:50:58,465 --> 00:51:00,500
- Definitely.
- OK!

1023
00:51:00,501 --> 00:51:02,035
Jump in!

1024
00:51:11,369 --> 00:51:13,236
Ahh!

1025
00:51:13,278 --> 00:51:15,614
Screaming like a little girl
won't help me fly this baby!

1026
00:51:19,451 --> 00:51:20,552
Uh...

1027
00:51:20,797 --> 00:51:22,164
Captain to co-captain...

1028
00:51:22,165 --> 00:51:23,966
"Captain" implies
that you actually know

1029
00:51:23,967 --> 00:51:24,801
how to fly this thing.

1030
00:51:24,837 --> 00:51:26,337
Chill! It's just like <i>Nitromaniacs.</i>

1031
00:51:26,338 --> 00:51:29,439
That's a video game!
This is an airplane!

1032
00:51:29,453 --> 00:51:31,788
And when my mom
finds out we stole it...

1033
00:51:31,789 --> 00:51:33,491
We didn't steal it.
It's Jensen property.

1034
00:51:33,502 --> 00:51:36,637
I'm a Jensen employee,
and we're on a Jensen mission.

1035
00:51:36,638 --> 00:51:38,672
She'll buy that!
Oh, I'm so dead!

1036
00:51:38,673 --> 00:51:40,875
Not if we get back
the molecular assembler

1037
00:51:40,876 --> 00:51:42,576
and save the world!

1038
00:51:42,577 --> 00:51:44,845
Trust me, you'll go from
juvie to hero in one night.

1039
00:51:44,846 --> 00:51:46,247
Assuming I survive this--

1040
00:51:46,248 --> 00:51:47,548
- Hang on!
- Ahh!

1041
00:52:06,688 --> 00:52:08,489
It doesn't
make any sense.

1042
00:52:08,490 --> 00:52:10,958
The trail ends just
outside the door.

1043
00:52:12,227 --> 00:52:13,260
Ingrid!

1044
00:52:13,261 --> 00:52:14,862
<i>Matt, I'm so glad you're OK.</i>

1045
00:52:14,863 --> 00:52:15,864
We're fine,
but no one's here.

1046
00:52:15,945 --> 00:52:17,111
<i>You were too late?</i>

1047
00:52:17,112 --> 00:52:18,346
By about 10 years.

1048
00:52:18,347 --> 00:52:20,515
There's 2 inches of dust
on the floor.

1049
00:52:20,516 --> 00:52:23,218
The assembler's trail
leads right up to the door,

1050
00:52:23,219 --> 00:52:25,220
but no equipment,
no people, no Edwin.

1051
00:52:25,221 --> 00:52:26,088
No, that's impossible.

1052
00:52:26,178 --> 00:52:27,611
The trail
from the airport

1053
00:52:27,612 --> 00:52:29,146
led to that
exact location.

1054
00:52:29,147 --> 00:52:30,548
We've looked everywhere, Jenny.

1055
00:52:30,549 --> 00:52:32,583
Don't waste any more
time there then.

1056
00:52:32,584 --> 00:52:34,351
Get back here
as soon as you can.

1057
00:52:34,352 --> 00:52:36,287
When we go back,
I'm taking the train.

1058
00:52:36,288 --> 00:52:37,721
Suit yourself,

1059
00:52:37,722 --> 00:52:39,824
but so you know,
I have an instrument rating

1060
00:52:39,825 --> 00:52:42,059
and a couple hundred hours
logged in that bird.

1061
00:52:42,060 --> 00:52:43,761
And that's the best
you could do?

1062
00:52:43,762 --> 00:52:44,795
Come on, dude.

1063
00:52:44,796 --> 00:52:47,164
Let's not keep
the bad guys waiting.

1064
00:52:49,468 --> 00:52:51,469
OK, it looks like
we're all done here.

1065
00:52:51,470 --> 00:52:52,770
Let's get to the chopper.

1066
00:52:57,509 --> 00:52:58,542
What's wrong?

1067
00:52:59,644 --> 00:53:01,879
I know this is
gonna sound crazy.

1068
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:04,315
I just... I feel so
deflated, somehow.

1069
00:53:04,316 --> 00:53:07,184
I was so ready to
confront Edwin, and now...

1070
00:53:07,185 --> 00:53:09,620
Most people never
face their ghosts.

1071
00:53:09,621 --> 00:53:10,888
At least you're trying.

1072
00:53:14,825 --> 00:53:16,692
I know what kind
of influence

1073
00:53:16,693 --> 00:53:19,261
the doubts Edwin
instilled in me have had.

1074
00:53:21,331 --> 00:53:25,367
Not just on my work,
but on all of us...

1075
00:53:26,903 --> 00:53:28,537
on the choices we made

1076
00:53:28,538 --> 00:53:31,140
for Brody and for you
and for me.

1077
00:53:34,644 --> 00:53:35,945
I just wish...

1078
00:53:38,148 --> 00:53:42,384
I had been as ready to stand up
to him back then as I am now.

1079
00:53:42,385 --> 00:53:44,887
Yeah, me too.

1080
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:46,021
Come on.

1081
00:53:53,563 --> 00:53:55,731
This one should be it.

1082
00:54:23,426 --> 00:54:24,894
That's the assembler.

1083
00:54:26,596 --> 00:54:28,564
There are
people around it,

1084
00:54:28,565 --> 00:54:32,067
including some that look
like they eat nails.

1085
00:54:32,068 --> 00:54:33,836
Let's go.

1086
00:54:38,542 --> 00:54:39,808
Come here.

1087
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:49,318
I re-checked
the data again.

1088
00:54:49,319 --> 00:54:52,888
There were significant traces
of both gold and silicon.

1089
00:54:52,889 --> 00:54:54,390
The chem. trace
was correct.

1090
00:54:54,391 --> 00:54:55,391
This is weird.

1091
00:54:55,392 --> 00:54:56,825
What?

1092
00:54:56,826 --> 00:54:58,561
The levels are
double the amount

1093
00:54:58,562 --> 00:54:59,728
used in the assembler.

1094
00:55:14,110 --> 00:55:15,411
What are you doing?

1095
00:55:15,412 --> 00:55:16,545
Nothing.

1096
00:55:17,781 --> 00:55:19,648
Stop being such a dork!

1097
00:55:19,649 --> 00:55:21,817
- Did you find Brody?
- Still looking.

1098
00:55:21,818 --> 00:55:23,986
- You check Sam's boathouse?
- On my way now.

1099
00:55:23,987 --> 00:55:25,788
You're busy.
We'll do it.

1100
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:39,301
Ingrid, the lockdown was
triggered from the inside.

1101
00:55:39,302 --> 00:55:40,769
Then it wasn't Edwin.

1102
00:55:40,770 --> 00:55:42,504
Not unless he left
a mole behind.

1103
00:55:42,505 --> 00:55:45,007
Well, whoever it was,
we need to find them now!

1104
00:55:46,042 --> 00:55:47,276
So what now?

1105
00:55:47,277 --> 00:55:50,779
Now we figure out how
to get to the assembler.

1106
00:55:54,918 --> 00:55:56,619
Uh... dude?

1107
00:55:59,756 --> 00:56:00,756
Hello?

1108
00:56:00,757 --> 00:56:01,824
One sec.

1109
00:56:05,328 --> 00:56:06,695
Oh!

1110
00:56:08,064 --> 00:56:09,064
Here.

1111
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:12,601
- Ugh! That smells like--
- A smart...

1112
00:56:12,602 --> 00:56:14,169
way to clear a room.

1113
00:56:16,873 --> 00:56:18,407
Hand me the bottle.

1114
00:56:51,708 --> 00:56:53,208
What's happening?

1115
00:56:53,209 --> 00:56:55,711
We have a contaminant breach!

1116
00:56:55,712 --> 00:56:56,912
Clear the room.

1117
00:56:56,913 --> 00:56:58,814
We gotta clear the room!

1118
00:56:58,815 --> 00:57:00,249
Let's go!

1119
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:02,051
Get out! Get out!

1120
00:57:02,052 --> 00:57:04,586
Hey, put it down!
Go! Get out!

1121
00:57:04,587 --> 00:57:05,688
Leave! Leave!

1122
00:57:05,689 --> 00:57:06,689
Let's get going!

1123
00:57:07,891 --> 00:57:09,591
Move! Move! Move!

1124
00:57:09,592 --> 00:57:10,826
Shut it down!

1125
00:57:10,827 --> 00:57:12,127
And out!

1126
00:57:12,128 --> 00:57:14,029
Come on, everyone!
Let's go! Let's go!

1127
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:18,901
Come on, let's go.

1128
00:57:29,779 --> 00:57:32,715
Looks more like a toaster
than a deadly weapon.

1129
00:57:32,716 --> 00:57:34,650
The people who
stole it are deadly.

1130
00:57:34,651 --> 00:57:36,585
Grab it and let's
get out of here.

1131
00:57:38,421 --> 00:57:40,022
Let's go!

1132
00:57:40,023 --> 00:57:41,990
Got it? Come on!

1133
00:57:41,991 --> 00:57:46,428
Do you have any idea
what a setback this is?

1134
00:57:46,429 --> 00:57:47,563
Stop them!

1135
00:57:56,172 --> 00:57:58,273
Uh!

1136
00:57:58,274 --> 00:57:59,274
Sam!

1137
00:58:01,311 --> 00:58:02,678
Thanks, dude!

1138
00:58:02,679 --> 00:58:03,679
Ow!

1139
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:05,614
Ah! Sam!

1140
00:58:05,615 --> 00:58:07,816
Sam, catch!

1141
00:58:07,817 --> 00:58:09,017
The assembler!

1142
00:58:09,018 --> 00:58:10,753
Get up!
Go after her!

1143
00:58:11,721 --> 00:58:13,455
Go, Sam! Go!

1144
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:21,797
And who do we have here?

1145
00:58:24,401 --> 00:58:25,934
Answer me!

1146
00:58:25,935 --> 00:58:27,803
My name is Brody.

1147
00:58:29,973 --> 00:58:31,573
Brody Thompson.

1148
00:58:31,574 --> 00:58:33,542
Brody Thompson...

1149
00:58:34,811 --> 00:58:37,813
Hey, guys,
are you here?

1150
00:58:40,417 --> 00:58:41,450
Wow!

1151
00:58:41,451 --> 00:58:42,518
Cool digs!

1152
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:45,020
Ah, this is the last
thing we need.

1153
00:58:45,021 --> 00:58:46,255
Where could they be?

1154
00:58:46,256 --> 00:58:47,923
Are you kidding?
In this place?

1155
00:58:47,924 --> 00:58:50,058
They could be
coming up with an addendum

1156
00:58:50,059 --> 00:58:51,927
to Einstein's
theory of relativity.

1157
00:58:51,928 --> 00:58:55,330
I just wish for once he'd
let us know what he's up to.

1158
00:58:55,331 --> 00:58:57,399
Well, we teach
by example, honey.

1159
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:59,001
We kept him
out of the loop.

1160
00:58:59,002 --> 00:59:01,136
Now he's just
returning the favor.

1161
00:59:01,137 --> 00:59:04,206
<i>Matt? Claire?</i>
<i>I've got Sam calling in.</i>

1162
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:05,274
Oh...

1163
00:59:05,275 --> 00:59:06,942
We got the assembler,
but I...

1164
00:59:06,943 --> 00:59:08,577
<i>What? How did you--</i>

1165
00:59:08,578 --> 00:59:11,613
Dr. James' voice tracker
picked up Edwin's signal.

1166
00:59:11,614 --> 00:59:13,916
<i>But it was during</i>
<i>the lockdown and--and...</i>

1167
00:59:13,917 --> 00:59:15,617
Slow down.
Is Brody with you?

1168
00:59:15,618 --> 00:59:18,153
That's what I'm telling you!
Some guards grabbed me.

1169
00:59:18,154 --> 00:59:21,590
And Brody jumped in
so I could get away, and...

1170
00:59:21,591 --> 00:59:23,425
Sam, where is Brody now?

1171
00:59:24,661 --> 00:59:26,028
I don't know.

1172
00:59:37,726 --> 00:59:40,027
Everybody's on it, Claire.

1173
00:59:40,028 --> 00:59:41,061
<i>We'll find him.</i>

1174
00:59:43,498 --> 00:59:46,033
We never should
have come back here.

1175
00:59:48,470 --> 00:59:50,404
We never
should have left.

1176
00:59:53,908 --> 00:59:55,642
That day when Edwin...

1177
00:59:57,946 --> 01:00:00,180
That was the worst
day of my life.

1178
01:00:03,451 --> 01:00:05,719

a million times worse.

you could not

Then you became so afraid
it was going to happen again,

1183
01:00:16,598 --> 01:00:18,632
you got out of

Mom, I was only
trying to help.

1201
01:01:07,049 --> 01:01:08,316
I know. Sam told us.

1202
01:01:08,317 --> 01:01:09,684
Next time, though,

1203
01:01:09,685 --> 01:01:11,519
let's discuss the risks
we intend to take

1204
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:13,188
before we take them, OK?

1205
01:01:13,189 --> 01:01:14,489
You scared us, man.

1206
01:01:14,490 --> 01:01:15,457
I'm sorry.

1207
01:01:15,458 --> 01:01:16,991
I'm glad you're OK.

1208
01:01:16,992 --> 01:01:19,027
Are you hungry?
You must be starving.

No, no, I'm good, thanks.

1210
01:01:20,529 --> 01:01:23,098
So what happened after
I bounced out of there?

1211
01:01:23,099 --> 01:01:25,133
Ah, no idea.
It's all totally fuzzy.

1212
01:01:25,134 --> 01:01:27,335
All I remember is
waking up on the street.

1213
01:01:27,336 --> 01:01:29,204
- You made it!
- Brilliant!

1214

01:02:31,901 --> 01:02:34,335
Now, I'll call
you back, one hour,

1235
01:02:34,336 --> 01:02:36,037
with a time
and a place.

1236
01:02:36,038 --> 01:02:38,273
<i>And you'll bring</i>
<i>the assembler.</i>

1237
01:02:45,014 --> 01:02:46,714
Don't worry.

1238
01:02:46,715 --> 01:02:48,750
She will give it back.

1239
01:02:50,619 --> 01:02:52,320
It's linked to
his blood vessels.

1240
01:02:52,321 --> 01:02:53,721
There's a way
to UN-link it!

1241
01:02:53,722 --> 01:02:54,956
Does it feel weird?

1242
01:02:54,957 --> 01:02:57,225
I didn't even know
it was in me until now.

1243
01:02:57,226 --> 01:02:58,760
Where's the assembler?

1244
01:02:58,761 --> 01:03:00,228
- Excuse me?
- What?

1245
01:03:00,229 --> 01:03:03,398
I'm sorry, but ethically,
this is a classic case

1246
01:03:03,399 --> 01:03:06,234
of what's good for the many
vs. what's good for one.

1247
01:03:06,235 --> 01:03:08,002
We need to discuss
the implications--

1248
01:03:08,003 --> 01:03:09,103
Are you kidding me?

1249
01:03:09,104 --> 01:03:10,471
This is not theoretical!

1250
01:03:10,472 --> 01:03:13,141
This is my son's life
we're talking about!

1251
01:03:14,243 --> 01:03:16,911
- Claire...
- Let me, please.

1252
01:03:24,653 --> 01:03:25,987
Ugh!

1253
01:03:27,790 --> 01:03:29,224
Play files.

1254
01:03:30,826 --> 01:03:32,260
Next!

1255
01:03:33,262 --> 01:03:34,262
Next!

1256
01:03:37,132 --> 01:03:38,299
Play file.

1257
01:03:38,300 --> 01:03:42,570
<i>We've just witnessed</i>
<i>utter failure.</i>

1258
01:03:42,571 --> 01:03:44,239
Pause file!

1259
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:55,049
I'm not a genius
like the rest of you.

1260
01:03:56,385 --> 01:03:58,319
My father understood that.

1261
01:04:00,155 --> 01:04:03,491
My father meant for me to be
the heart of the Jensen Project.

1262
01:04:03,492 --> 01:04:05,560
He depended on me...

1263
01:04:05,561 --> 01:04:07,629
to make sure that...

1264
01:04:07,630 --> 01:04:09,797
there would be compassion...

1265
01:04:11,066 --> 01:04:14,002
in the often-clinical world
that we've created here.

1266
01:04:15,271 --> 01:04:16,604
I failed you.

1267
01:04:17,606 --> 01:04:19,240
I failed my father.

1268
01:04:21,644 --> 01:04:23,177
I failed myself.

1269
01:04:25,914 --> 01:04:27,782
I knew that Edwin went

1270
01:04:27,783 --> 01:04:30,852
way beyond the
professional that day.

1271
01:04:33,389 --> 01:04:36,524
He wounded you
personally and deeply.

1272
01:04:36,525 --> 01:04:37,892
He...

1273
01:04:38,927 --> 01:04:40,628
was wrong about you.

1274
01:04:42,831 --> 01:04:45,800
I knew that, and I'm sure
that he knew that.

1275
01:04:49,004 --> 01:04:51,472
I'm so sorry...

1276
01:04:52,541 --> 01:04:53,775
for then...

1277
01:04:56,111 --> 01:04:57,445
and for now...

1278
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:00,682
And I want you
to know, Claire...

1279
01:05:01,717 --> 01:05:04,919
anything that we can
do to protect Brody,

1280
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:06,354
we will do.

1281
01:05:13,395 --> 01:05:15,163
Neeva, would you
do me a favor

1282
01:05:15,164 --> 01:05:17,198
and run this down
to Claire, please?

1283
01:05:17,199 --> 01:05:18,366
Send a digital file.

1284
01:05:18,367 --> 01:05:19,767
She wants a hard copy.

1285
01:05:19,768 --> 01:05:21,703
And to tell
you the truth,

1286
01:05:21,704 --> 01:05:25,006
I really don't trust
anybody else right now.

1287
01:05:26,608 --> 01:05:28,509
All right.
I'll take care of it.

1288
01:05:28,510 --> 01:05:29,544
Thank you.

1289
01:05:29,545 --> 01:05:31,012
Close topic.

1290
01:05:31,013 --> 01:05:32,347
Appreciate it.

1291
01:05:41,857 --> 01:05:43,257
The algorithms
don't match.

1292
01:05:43,258 --> 01:05:46,227
It won't move out of the heart
without tearing the tissue.

1293
01:05:46,228 --> 01:05:48,796
- If we give him a diuretic...
- What?

1294
01:05:48,797 --> 01:05:50,698
Won't work.
Neither will dialysis.

1295
01:05:50,699 --> 01:05:52,767
Or plasmapheresis
or any execratory that--

1296
01:05:52,768 --> 01:05:53,768
Dad!

1297
01:05:54,803 --> 01:05:56,237
Great genius talk.

1298
01:05:56,238 --> 01:05:58,339
I'm sorry.

1299
01:06:03,812 --> 01:06:05,313
Ingrid!

1300
01:06:09,017 --> 01:06:10,017
It was Neeva.

1301
01:06:10,018 --> 01:06:11,386
What?

1302
01:06:11,387 --> 01:06:13,821
- She triggered the lockdown.
- Why would she?

1303
01:06:13,822 --> 01:06:16,257
- Obviously working with Edwin.
- Are you sure?

1304
01:06:16,258 --> 01:06:18,693
The code that was used
to trigger the lockdown

1305
01:06:18,694 --> 01:06:19,894
is the same one
she used

1306
01:06:19,895 --> 01:06:22,130
to call up surveillance
cams on her tablet.

1307
01:06:22,131 --> 01:06:24,065
Where is she now?

1308
01:06:30,839 --> 01:06:32,407
Neeva!

1309
01:06:46,314 --> 01:06:47,481
Move!

1310
01:06:49,016 --> 01:06:50,517
Out of the way!

1311
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:52,900
Excuse me! Excuse me!

1312
01:06:55,470 --> 01:06:56,504
Neeva!

1313
01:06:57,673 --> 01:06:59,273
Neeva, wait!

1314
01:07:01,777 --> 01:07:03,211
Neeva!

1315
01:07:22,130 --> 01:07:24,432
Right now the Jensen
geniuses are busy

1316
01:07:24,433 --> 01:07:27,101
trying to come up with a way
to remove the nanobot

1317
01:07:27,102 --> 01:07:29,237
without my knowing,
which is impossible.

1318
01:07:32,541 --> 01:07:33,875
Yeah.

1319
01:07:33,876 --> 01:07:35,243
Kendrick figured it out.

1320
01:07:35,244 --> 01:07:37,278
<i>It was only a matter of time.</i>
<i>You safe?</i>

1321
01:07:37,279 --> 01:07:38,346
For now.

1322
01:07:38,347 --> 01:07:40,915
- Are they gonna trade?
- <i>Of course.</i>

1323
01:07:40,916 --> 01:07:42,383
You left them no choice.

1324
01:07:42,384 --> 01:07:43,818
Good.

1325
01:07:47,856 --> 01:07:50,191
If it deactivates,

1326
01:07:50,192 --> 01:07:51,259
it detaches, right?

1327
01:07:51,260 --> 01:07:52,360
I suppose.

1328
01:07:52,361 --> 01:07:54,395
But in order to
deactivate it,

1329
01:07:54,396 --> 01:07:57,298
you need to know
how he's controlling it.

1330
01:07:57,299 --> 01:07:59,166
If it were me...

1331
01:08:01,570 --> 01:08:03,671
I think I'd develop
a phone app!

1332
01:08:03,672 --> 01:08:05,873
You'd develop the app
on your computer?

1333
01:08:05,874 --> 01:08:08,342
And his computers
in his lab!

1334
01:08:10,245 --> 01:08:12,647
Publicly, Neeva despised
Edwin. It was a charade.

1335
01:08:12,648 --> 01:08:13,781
Not only that.

1336
01:08:13,782 --> 01:08:15,917
From her phone calls
over the last months,

1337
01:08:15,918 --> 01:08:18,152
it appears they were more
than just colleagues.

1338
01:08:18,153 --> 01:08:20,488
I wish we could pause this day
and rewind it.

1339
01:08:20,489 --> 01:08:21,889
And then erase it!

1340
01:08:21,890 --> 01:08:23,324
What did you just say?

1341
01:08:23,325 --> 01:08:25,960
I don't know. It just
comes out. I can't control it.

1342
01:08:25,961 --> 01:08:27,194
You said "pause."

1343
01:08:27,195 --> 01:08:29,830
Maybe there's a way
to pause the program.

1344
01:08:29,831 --> 01:08:31,299
Temporarily block the signal

1345
01:08:31,300 --> 01:08:33,334
that Edwin's using
to control the nanobot!

1346
01:08:33,335 --> 01:08:35,236
- Exactly!
- He'll need a remote

1347
01:08:35,237 --> 01:08:36,938
to control the nanobot.

1348
01:08:36,939 --> 01:08:38,639
We think he's using
a phone app.

1349
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:41,275
That makes sense! That's
the signal we need to block.

1350
01:08:41,276 --> 01:08:43,177
The mainframe would
still control it.

1351
01:08:43,178 --> 01:08:45,112
So we shut that down, too.

1352
01:08:45,113 --> 01:08:47,348
And download the data
before we do it!

1353
01:08:47,349 --> 01:08:48,349
We have no choice.

1354
01:08:48,350 --> 01:08:49,350
We have to move,

1355
01:08:49,351 --> 01:08:51,052
even if you get
the assembler back.

1356
01:08:51,053 --> 01:08:52,820
I will get
the assembler back.

1357
01:08:52,821 --> 01:08:54,121
They know where we are.

1358
01:08:56,358 --> 01:08:57,725
It's time.

1359
01:08:57,726 --> 01:09:00,394
If we work it from both ends,
we might have a chance.

1360
01:09:00,395 --> 01:09:02,363
I can re-task
a couple of satellites,

1361
01:09:02,364 --> 01:09:04,265
get you some
infrared coverage.

1362
01:09:04,266 --> 01:09:07,168
It'll only work if Edwin
leaves the lab for the exchange.

1363
01:09:07,169 --> 01:09:10,871
<i>Incoming transmission</i>
<i>from Edwin Jensen.</i>

1364
01:09:14,309 --> 01:09:15,676
Answer call.

1365
01:09:15,677 --> 01:09:18,479
<i>Behind the Brooklyn</i>
<i>Botanical Society.</i>

1366
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:20,881
Chinese gardens.
Two hours.

1367
01:09:20,882 --> 01:09:22,283
I assume you'll be there.

1368
01:09:22,284 --> 01:09:23,284
I'll be there.

1369
01:09:23,285 --> 01:09:24,752
I never doubted it.

1370
01:09:32,928 --> 01:09:34,195
Hey.

1371
01:09:35,797 --> 01:09:37,131
Hey.

1372
01:09:37,132 --> 01:09:39,567
How you holding up,
big guy?

1373
01:09:43,372 --> 01:09:44,939
It's OK to be scared.

1374
01:09:44,940 --> 01:09:47,141
It'd be weird
if you weren't.

1375
01:09:49,244 --> 01:09:51,545
What if our plan
doesn't work, Mom?

1376
01:09:51,546 --> 01:09:52,780
What if--

1377
01:09:52,781 --> 01:09:55,082
Don't do that
to yourself, sweetie.

1378
01:09:56,151 --> 01:09:58,619
Don't think about
the "what if."

1379
01:10:00,055 --> 01:10:02,490
Just focus on
the "what is."

1380
01:10:05,427 --> 01:10:07,795
Look, we have a problem.

1381
01:10:09,564 --> 01:10:10,831
A big one.

1382
01:10:10,832 --> 01:10:13,601
But we also have
a solution, OK?

1383
01:10:13,602 --> 01:10:15,836
And if we keep our heads...

1384
01:10:16,838 --> 01:10:18,472
we will get through this.

1385
01:10:19,508 --> 01:10:20,808
I promise.

1386
01:10:22,577 --> 01:10:24,211
Troops are gathering.

1387
01:10:25,647 --> 01:10:26,981
You guys ready?

1388
01:10:30,585 --> 01:10:31,685
Yeah.

1389
01:10:31,686 --> 01:10:32,987
Yeah, we're ready.

1390
01:10:42,397 --> 01:10:44,899
So this works
in 2 phases.

1391
01:10:44,900 --> 01:10:46,834
The program used to
control the nanobot

1392
01:10:46,835 --> 01:10:48,836
was likely created
in Edwin's mainframe.

1393
01:10:48,837 --> 01:10:51,072
We need to get
into his lab,

1394
01:10:51,073 --> 01:10:53,707
download the program
and destroy the CPU.

1395
01:10:53,708 --> 01:10:55,376
From what Sam and Brody
told us,

1396
01:10:55,377 --> 01:10:58,345
Edwin's computer is located
on the second floor.

1397
01:10:58,346 --> 01:10:59,814
Here.

1398
01:10:59,815 --> 01:11:02,249
If Edwin gets away
and we haven't destroyed it,

1399
01:11:02,250 --> 01:11:04,218
he will always have
control over Brody.

1400
01:11:04,219 --> 01:11:07,721
Matt, Sam and Brody
will go back to the lab.

1401
01:11:07,722 --> 01:11:08,889
We'll take the XT.

1402
01:11:08,890 --> 01:11:10,324
- The what?
- You'll see.

1403
01:11:10,325 --> 01:11:12,426
According to Kendrick's
sat surveillance,

1404
01:11:12,427 --> 01:11:15,396
Edwin is already
clearing out of the lab.

1405
01:11:15,397 --> 01:11:18,065
Brody, I mean it this time.

1406
01:11:18,066 --> 01:11:20,734
You and Sam are
there to guide only.

1407
01:11:20,735 --> 01:11:22,136
This is your dad's show.

1408
01:11:22,137 --> 01:11:24,171
I will be meeting
Edwin in Brooklyn.

1409
01:11:24,172 --> 01:11:26,807
I will use the assembler
to distract him

1410
01:11:26,808 --> 01:11:29,243
until we can get
the wattage we need

1411
01:11:29,244 --> 01:11:30,544
to jam his cell phone.

1412
01:11:30,545 --> 01:11:32,046
Ginny...

1413
01:11:32,047 --> 01:11:35,082
I'll shut down sectors 7 to 15
to draw the necessary power.

1414
01:11:35,083 --> 01:11:37,218
And once Edwin's
cell phone is neutralized,

1415
01:11:37,219 --> 01:11:39,353
I'll move in
with my team,

1416
01:11:39,354 --> 01:11:42,356
but not until we reach
100% power, OK?

1417
01:11:42,357 --> 01:11:44,158
You are all geniuses.

1418
01:11:45,961 --> 01:11:47,862
Today's the day to prove it.

1419
01:11:50,432 --> 01:11:53,000
I am counting
on you and your dad

1420
01:11:53,001 --> 01:11:54,502
to take care
of each other.

1421
01:11:54,503 --> 01:11:57,138
And I'm counting on you to
take care of both of them.

1422
01:11:57,139 --> 01:11:59,173
You got it, Mrs. Thompson.

1423
01:11:59,174 --> 01:12:01,142
All right, let's do it.

1424
01:12:07,015 --> 01:12:08,649
So that's the XT?

1425
01:12:10,886 --> 01:12:13,053
Huh... I like it!

1426
01:12:24,666 --> 01:12:27,635
Claire, I've got Matt
on the com for you.

1427
01:12:29,738 --> 01:12:30,971
How's Brody?

1428
01:12:30,972 --> 01:12:32,506
Spoiling for a fight!

1429
01:12:32,507 --> 01:12:33,874
I know how he feels.

1430
01:12:33,875 --> 01:12:35,676
<i>I bet you do.</i>
<i>Don't worry!</i>

1431
01:12:35,677 --> 01:12:36,944
We're gonna be fine.

1432
01:12:36,945 --> 01:12:39,213
- Keep an eye on our boy.
- Will do.

1433
01:12:41,750 --> 01:12:43,751
Ginny, you got infrared
on the building?

1434
01:12:43,752 --> 01:12:46,253
Yeah. I'm only counting
15 people inside.

1435
01:12:46,254 --> 01:12:47,988
Edwin and his crew
are definitely

1436
01:12:47,989 --> 01:12:49,590
in get-out-of-dodge mode.

1437
01:12:49,591 --> 01:12:51,926
Approach from the north.
There's a maintenance room.

1438
01:12:51,927 --> 01:12:53,827
Main electrical panel
is there.

1439
01:12:53,828 --> 01:12:55,729
Got it.

1440
01:12:59,301 --> 01:13:02,336
All right,
your com is all set.

1441
01:13:02,337 --> 01:13:03,470
Hey, you OK?

1442
01:13:04,739 --> 01:13:06,707
All right. Good luck.

1443
01:13:33,935 --> 01:13:35,002
OK, we're in.

1444
01:13:43,378 --> 01:13:46,547
Ginny, Claire's almost
in position.

1445
01:13:46,548 --> 01:13:48,716
I got her.
Claire, you copy?

1446
01:13:48,717 --> 01:13:50,384
- Loud and clear.
- <i>Good.</i>

1447
01:13:50,385 --> 01:13:52,086
We're powering up the wattage.

1448
01:13:52,087 --> 01:13:54,622
I will let you know
the second we have the juice

1449
01:13:54,623 --> 01:13:56,590
to jam up his signal
to the nanobot.

1450
01:13:56,591 --> 01:13:58,225
- We're in.
- I see you.

1451
01:13:58,226 --> 01:14:00,194
How do I get into
Edwin's lab?

1452
01:14:00,195 --> 01:14:03,163
There's a ladder that leads
to a decontamination centre,

1453
01:14:03,164 --> 01:14:06,400
northeast wall of the room that
you're standing in right now.

1454
01:14:06,401 --> 01:14:08,369
I got it.

1455
01:14:22,083 --> 01:14:24,084
Matt, you've got company.

1456
01:14:29,908 --> 01:14:30,908
Who are you?

1457
01:14:31,007 --> 01:14:33,008
Maintenance sent us over
to fix the...

1458
01:14:41,784 --> 01:14:44,553
OK. That was impressive.

1459
01:14:44,554 --> 01:14:47,122
I told you she was cool.

1460
01:14:47,123 --> 01:14:50,292
OK, eventually, they're gonna
know that this guy's missing.

1461
01:14:50,293 --> 01:14:51,860
When they do,
we're cooked.

1462
01:14:51,861 --> 01:14:54,863
- Let's get this done.
- How long to search the system?

1463
01:14:54,864 --> 01:14:56,331
Give us 10.

1464
01:14:56,332 --> 01:14:58,867
Dad, do you really
have to go up there?

1465
01:14:58,868 --> 01:15:02,104
Unless we download his files
before we blow out the system,

1466
01:15:02,105 --> 01:15:04,639
we'll destroy all the work
the Jensen Project's done

1467
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:05,974
to create the nanobots.

1468
01:15:05,975 --> 01:15:08,043
In the right hands,
it'll save a lot of lives.

1469
01:15:08,044 --> 01:15:09,578
If it weren't for me.

1470
01:15:09,579 --> 01:15:11,947
If not for you,
we'd never have found this lab.

1471
01:15:11,948 --> 01:15:14,216
I'll be OK, Brody.
No one knows me here.

1472
01:15:14,217 --> 01:15:16,551
They'll think I'm just
one of their techs.

1473
01:15:17,620 --> 01:15:18,754
Yeah.

1474
01:15:18,755 --> 01:15:20,055
Ten minutes.

1475
01:15:43,813 --> 01:15:47,215
Ha! Time to tango.
Eighty-five percent.

1476
01:15:47,216 --> 01:15:48,917
Edwin is on site.

1477
01:15:48,918 --> 01:15:50,318
Got him.

1478
01:15:54,257 --> 01:15:55,724
Where is it, Claire?

1479
01:16:03,966 --> 01:16:06,468
How will I know
if you disabled the nanobot?

1480
01:16:06,469 --> 01:16:08,203
Don't waste
my time, Claire.

1481
01:16:08,204 --> 01:16:10,739
You're obviously monitoring
his vital functions.

1482
01:16:10,740 --> 01:16:13,341
After I've inspected
the assembler,

1483
01:16:13,342 --> 01:16:14,943
I'll send the signal.

1484
01:16:14,944 --> 01:16:17,179
Kendrick, Ingrid,
your husband,

1485
01:16:17,180 --> 01:16:19,681
they'll all see
the nanobot shut down.

1486
01:16:19,682 --> 01:16:21,349
Now, if you don't mind...

1487
01:16:29,125 --> 01:16:31,560
Wattage at 90%.

1488
01:16:31,561 --> 01:16:32,828
<i>Keep him talking.</i>

1489
01:16:32,829 --> 01:16:34,896
What's to keep you
from rebooting the nanobot

1490
01:16:34,897 --> 01:16:36,298
once I give you
the assembler?

1491
01:16:36,299 --> 01:16:37,299
Nothing.

1492
01:16:37,300 --> 01:16:39,534
I literally hold
your son's life

1493
01:16:39,535 --> 01:16:41,203
in the palm
of my hand.

1494
01:16:41,204 --> 01:16:43,638
You have no choice
but to trust me.

1495
01:16:45,608 --> 01:16:46,675
Trust you?

1496
01:16:46,676 --> 01:16:48,944
The man who's threatening
my child's life?

1497
01:16:48,945 --> 01:16:50,979
Ninety-five percent.

1498
01:16:50,980 --> 01:16:53,415
The man who told me
my work wasn't good enough

1499
01:16:53,416 --> 01:16:54,950
and then continued
to develop it?

1500
01:16:54,951 --> 01:16:55,984
Trust you, Edwin?

1501
01:16:55,985 --> 01:16:57,886
Be careful, Claire.

1502
01:17:05,795 --> 01:17:07,529
Your own father
didn't trust you.

1503
01:17:07,530 --> 01:17:10,599
That's why he gave control of
the Jensen Project to Ingrid

1504
01:17:10,600 --> 01:17:11,633
instead of you.

1505
01:17:11,634 --> 01:17:13,201
Ninety-six percent.

1506
01:17:15,371 --> 01:17:17,706
Spliced into city power,
about a zillion volts.

1507
01:17:17,707 --> 01:17:18,740
You good to go?

1508
01:17:18,741 --> 01:17:20,308
Easier than hotwiring a 4x4!

1509
01:17:23,246 --> 01:17:25,347
Ta-DA!
What do you think?

1510
01:17:25,348 --> 01:17:27,315
I think my dad
better be on his game

1511
01:17:27,316 --> 01:17:29,317
if we're gonna light
this baby up in...

1512
01:17:29,318 --> 01:17:30,919
Three minutes.

1513
01:17:44,500 --> 01:17:46,768
Your father didn't
doubt your intelligence.

1514
01:17:46,769 --> 01:17:48,069
He doubted
your character.

1515
01:17:48,070 --> 01:17:51,006
You really wanna show
the world that he was right?

1516
01:17:51,007 --> 01:17:52,240
<i>Ninety-eight percent.</i>

1517
01:17:52,241 --> 01:17:53,742
<i>Stall him, Claire.</i>

1518
01:17:53,743 --> 01:17:56,044
10... 9...

1519
01:17:56,045 --> 01:17:57,979
What are you
doing in here?

1520
01:17:59,815 --> 01:18:01,216
2... 1!

1521
01:18:09,091 --> 01:18:10,625
What I want...

1522
01:18:10,626 --> 01:18:12,460
is that assembler.

1523
01:18:48,497 --> 01:18:50,665
No! No!

1524
01:19:06,716 --> 01:19:08,016
Leave it, Edwin!

1525
01:19:10,586 --> 01:19:12,187
Brody?

1526
01:19:12,188 --> 01:19:13,788
He's OK.

1527
01:19:13,789 --> 01:19:17,459
They got Edwin's files
and shut down his lab.

1528
01:19:17,460 --> 01:19:19,294
- I don't believe that.
- Well...

1529
01:19:19,295 --> 01:19:22,197
maybe we'll let your friend
Cho explain it to you,

1530
01:19:22,198 --> 01:19:25,533
just as soon as he's finished
selling you out to the feds.

1531
01:19:36,512 --> 01:19:38,713
Edwin, how did it happen?

1532
01:19:40,316 --> 01:19:42,017
How did you end up here?

1533
01:20:15,010 --> 01:20:16,244
Brody!

1534
01:20:17,246 --> 01:20:18,313
Hey.

1535
01:20:18,314 --> 01:20:20,648
I've been
looking for you.

1536
01:20:20,649 --> 01:20:22,250
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1537
01:20:25,287 --> 01:20:26,688
I want to apologize.

1538
01:20:26,689 --> 01:20:28,456
For what?

1539
01:20:29,692 --> 01:20:32,393
Talking about stuff,
you know,

1540
01:20:32,394 --> 01:20:34,495
our feelings, our fears,

1541
01:20:34,496 --> 01:20:36,331
it's not always easy,

1542
01:20:36,332 --> 01:20:37,699
so we avoid it.

1543
01:20:37,700 --> 01:20:38,933
But in a family,

1544
01:20:38,934 --> 01:20:41,302
we shouldn't
have to do that.

1545
01:20:42,538 --> 01:20:45,306
I haven't set a very good
example in that regard.

1546
01:20:46,342 --> 01:20:48,309
But I promise,
from now on,

1547
01:20:48,310 --> 01:20:50,011
I'm gonna open up more.

1548
01:20:50,012 --> 01:20:52,313
And I'm gonna
listen better.

1549
01:20:52,314 --> 01:20:54,349
And I hope you will, too.

1550
01:20:55,417 --> 01:20:57,685
Yeah, I think
I can manage that.

1551
01:20:59,054 --> 01:21:01,789
And I'm sorry, too.

1552
01:21:01,790 --> 01:21:04,158
For, like, you know...

1553
01:21:04,159 --> 01:21:06,294
putting you through
so much stuff lately.

1554
01:21:10,065 --> 01:21:12,267
Well, now that
that's settled...

1555
01:21:18,274 --> 01:21:19,741
Ingrid left a message,

1556
01:21:19,742 --> 01:21:22,410
said there was something
I needed to see.

1557
01:21:22,411 --> 01:21:25,146
Yeah, she wanted me
to show this to you.

1558
01:21:26,582 --> 01:21:28,182
You left this file open.

1559
01:21:28,183 --> 01:21:29,984
Ingrid was going
to archive it

1560
01:21:29,985 --> 01:21:31,653
when she noticed this.

1561
01:21:31,654 --> 01:21:32,920
Play file.

1562
01:21:38,394 --> 01:21:41,496
That circuit board controls
the ciliary mechanism.

1563
01:21:41,497 --> 01:21:43,731
The nanobot can't
function without it.

1564
01:21:43,732 --> 01:21:46,434
He replaced yours
with one that was flawed.

1565
01:21:46,435 --> 01:21:48,636
He sabotaged my work.

1566
01:21:50,172 --> 01:21:51,939
Pause file.

1567
01:21:51,940 --> 01:21:53,741
And then he drove you away

1568
01:21:53,742 --> 01:21:56,244
so he could take over
your project.

1569
01:21:56,245 --> 01:21:59,147
Ah... I feel so stupid.

1570
01:21:59,148 --> 01:22:01,449
There's no way
you could've--

1571
01:22:01,450 --> 01:22:04,319
No, I mean,
to let that one event

1572
01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:06,220
so influence our lives.

1573
01:22:11,193 --> 01:22:12,593
Close file.

1574
01:22:15,597 --> 01:22:17,065
I love you.

1575
01:22:20,102 --> 01:22:21,536
Ah! Ew! Gross!

1576
01:22:23,238 --> 01:22:25,373
Hey, you better
pack your stuff.

1577
01:22:25,374 --> 01:22:26,407
We gotta take off!

1578
01:22:26,408 --> 01:22:27,775
What do you mean?

1579
01:22:27,776 --> 01:22:29,277
She means go home.

1580
01:22:29,278 --> 01:22:31,346
- You're kidding, right?
- No.

1581
01:22:31,347 --> 01:22:33,181
You mean go back
to school tomorrow

1582
01:22:33,182 --> 01:22:34,816
like none of this
ever happened?

1583
01:22:34,817 --> 01:22:36,384
That's insane!

1584
01:22:36,385 --> 01:22:37,852
May I suggest
an alternative?

1585
01:22:38,887 --> 01:22:40,388
Thanks to you guys,

1586
01:22:40,389 --> 01:22:42,990
the Jensen Project
can continue

1587
01:22:42,991 --> 01:22:44,792
to do its good work.

1588
01:22:44,793 --> 01:22:48,029
And I hope with all my heart
that you'll stay

1589
01:22:48,030 --> 01:22:51,733
and contribute your
genius to our efforts.

1590
01:22:53,469 --> 01:22:55,436
What about your practice?

1591
01:22:55,437 --> 01:22:57,739
I can cure patients
one at a time

1592
01:22:57,740 --> 01:22:59,607
or find a cure
for thousands.

1593
01:22:59,608 --> 01:23:01,242
Easy call.
What about you?

1594
01:23:04,313 --> 01:23:06,614
This place has
always been about

1595
01:23:06,615 --> 01:23:08,483
being the best you can be.

1596
01:23:08,484 --> 01:23:11,953
And I think it's time
our family gave that a try.

1597
01:23:11,954 --> 01:23:14,822
Of course, we're going to
talk it over with Brody.

1598
01:23:14,823 --> 01:23:16,391
Ah yes! Brody...

1599
01:23:16,392 --> 01:23:18,793
in the last
couple of days,

1600
01:23:18,794 --> 01:23:22,296
you've shown your own
brand of genius.

1601
01:23:22,297 --> 01:23:25,299
Unfortunately, mostly while
disobeying your parents.

1602
01:23:25,300 --> 01:23:26,834
- But I...
- Brody...

1603
01:23:28,904 --> 01:23:30,371
you risked your life

1604
01:23:30,372 --> 01:23:32,640
to protect Samantha
and the Jensen Project.

1605
01:23:34,710 --> 01:23:37,545
So it is my great pleasure
to offer you

1606
01:23:37,546 --> 01:23:40,815
a Jensen Project
apprenticeship.

1607
01:23:47,589 --> 01:23:49,924
So, dude...
I mean, Brody...

1608
01:23:49,925 --> 01:23:52,026
You gonna
accept or what?

1609
01:24:00,102 --> 01:24:01,269
Definitely!

1610
01:24:07,109 --> 01:24:08,443
Yes!
