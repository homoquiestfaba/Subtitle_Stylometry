from Russia today, okay?

350
00:19:14,867 --> 00:19:16,767
We've a serious
cash flow problem.

351
00:19:16,833 --> 00:19:19,833
We've had cash flow problems in
the past. It'll iron itself out.

352
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:23,167
If it does come through I still
don't think I can catch up.

353
00:19:23,233 --> 00:19:25,200
You've way too many
movies in production.

354
00:19:25,267 --> 00:19:28,833
You got Tiny Terrors on the big
stage, Space Makers in Studio B.

355
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:31,400
You've lose ends of movies
you're still trying to finish.

356
00:19:31,467 --> 00:19:34,967
I say we pull the plug on 90%
of what we got goin' on

357
00:19:35,067 --> 00:19:37,067
And just make one
really great movie.

358
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:39,600
Why don't we just try
to get through this week?

359
00:19:39,667 --> 00:19:41,733
Then we'll discuss
cutting back on future slate.

360
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,067
- Future slate.
- Mm-hmm.

361
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:46,433
We may not have one.

362
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:49,233
The script for "Tiny Terrors 9"
got leaked onto the internet.

363
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,067
People hate it. Alright?

364
00:19:51,133 --> 00:19:53,633
These online bloggers
and movie reviewers

365
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,433
They're starting to get
ferocious with you.

366
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,833
The reviewers love us.
They grew up with us.

367
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:00,000
My father's studio is
an American institution.

368
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,067
My father's studio is
an American institution.
- Really?
- Yeah.

369
00:20:00,067 --> 00:20:00,933
- Really?
- Yeah.

370
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:01,933
- Really? Okay.
- Really.

371
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,333
Let's see here.
Um, ooh.

372
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,467
"I'd rather have lye
poured into my eyes

373
00:20:05,533 --> 00:20:08,000
Than have to sit through another
half-baked Cheatum production."

374
00:20:08,067 --> 00:20:10,533
Uh, "Tiny Terrors 9,
audience nothing."

375
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:13,400
Uh, "A production so wooden,
it'll give you splinters."

376
00:20:13,467 --> 00:20:14,533
And here's my favorite.

377
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,567
"If you've trouble sleeping,
pop in the latest..."

378
00:20:16,633 --> 00:20:20,100
- Alright! Alright, I get it.
- And those are the good ones.

379
00:20:20,167 --> 00:20:22,933
There's this guy, this movie
reviewer, horror reviewer.

380
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,333
Calls himself
"Demon Warrior 13," alright?

381
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,200
He started a letter writing
campaign to boycott our movies

382
00:20:28,267 --> 00:20:31,033
And all outlets that sell 'em,
unless we shut down production.

383
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:34,000
Come on, how much damage can
Demon Warrior 13 actually cause?

384
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:35,867
In and Out Video
cancelled their order.

385
00:20:35,933 --> 00:20:37,700
Netpix cancelled their order.

386
00:20:37,767 --> 00:20:40,267
That bastard!
This guy's a maniac.

387
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:42,800
We're fading away, Kelvin,
alright? We need something big.

388
00:20:42,867 --> 00:20:45,667
Okay? Something that's gonna
draw attention to the studio.

389
00:20:45,733 --> 00:20:47,133
We need it fast.

390
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,767
I guess it's time to
get back to the bloodshed.

391
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:50,867
Gourmet cookies, huh?

392
00:20:50,933 --> 00:20:52,667
Hey, Polly, you
getting fancy on us?

393
00:20:52,733 --> 00:20:56,100
Just a little lovin'
from the oven, baby.

394
00:20:56,167 --> 00:20:58,200
(Ricki)
'Spread out,
make room for baby.'

395
00:20:58,267 --> 00:21:00,400
- Hey, watch it, man.
- Sorry, Butch.

396
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:02,700
So what you servin' up
tonight, Polly?

397
00:21:02,767 --> 00:21:06,833
Mmm. Some sugar and spice
and everything nice.

398
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,533
[Gasps]

399
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,100
Mom and I used to
make cookies together.

400
00:21:11,167 --> 00:21:16,567
When she wasn't drunk,
face-down on the kitchen floor.

401
00:21:16,633 --> 00:21:20,133
But don't you just
love raw cookie dough?

402
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,700
- Mm.
- Cream puff.

403
00:21:22,767 --> 00:21:24,500
(Gingerdead man)
'Boy, you're gonna get it.'

404
00:21:24,567 --> 00:21:27,233
(Male #4)
'Hey, Butch, get your
lazy ass over here.'

405
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:29,067
Alright, I'm coming.

406
00:21:31,767 --> 00:21:33,767
(Polly)
'Hands off, bitch. He's mine.'

407
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:39,333
(Kelvin)
'This studio has been
in my family for over 75 years.'

408
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,567
You know, my father is
personally responsible

409
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:46,200
For 1500 horror, sci-fi, martial
arts and action-adventure films.

410
00:21:46,267 --> 00:21:49,067
And I plan to continue
that legacy with my own brand

411
00:21:49,067 --> 00:21:51,067
Of high quality
genre entertainment.

412
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,367
We're one big,
happy family.

413
00:21:52,433 --> 00:21:55,600
There's not goddamn toilet paper
in the shitter again.

414
00:21:55,667 --> 00:21:56,633
'Dumb shit.'

415
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:59,900
I had to wipe my ass
with my socks.

416
00:22:00,067 --> 00:22:03,433
'I've had it with this dump
and your crappy projects.'

417
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:06,633
Fuck this shithole,
and fuck you, too.

418
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,700
'Do you hear me?
I fucking hate you.'

419
00:22:08,767 --> 00:22:09,733
'I hate you.'

420
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:10,767
[Sobbing]

421
00:22:10,833 --> 00:22:12,300
(Kelvin)
'Keep up the good work.'

422
00:22:12,367 --> 00:22:14,100
'I'll... see you on set.'

423
00:22:14,167 --> 00:22:17,233
And this is the area where
we house all of our talent.

424
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:19,900
Wow! Real life
movie star trailers.

425
00:22:19,967 --> 00:22:23,300
And not just any movie star,
but Sir Ian Cauvenaugh himself.

426
00:22:23,367 --> 00:22:25,867
Yeah, I-I wouldn't do that
if I were you, Kelvin.

427
00:22:25,933 --> 00:22:28,767
Oh. Tommy, Heather,
this is Jake Jackson.

428
00:22:28,833 --> 00:22:31,400
For 25 years, he's been
Hollywood's premiere stuntman

429
00:22:31,467 --> 00:22:32,700
And professional body double.

430
00:22:32,767 --> 00:22:34,300
He lives for danger.

431
00:22:34,367 --> 00:22:37,567
Hey, kid. Whatcha got under
the hood of that rig there?

432
00:22:37,633 --> 00:22:39,067
[Chuckling]

433
00:22:39,067 --> 00:22:41,300
I was about to introduce
Tommy to the star

434
00:22:41,367 --> 00:22:43,067
Of our latest
Tiny Terrors picture.

435
00:22:43,067 --> 00:22:44,967
Yeah. Now's probably
not a good time.

436
00:22:45,067 --> 00:22:47,933
Why don't you guys go to the
special effects trailer, huh?

437
00:22:48,067 --> 00:22:50,433
I hear that they're building
a giant evil pineapple.

438
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,533
(Kelvin)
'No, no, no.'

439
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,333
This is sort of
a special occasion.

440
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,667
- I think he'd...
- Look.

441
00:22:54,733 --> 00:22:57,633
He's holding himself up in the
trailer. He's not coming out.

442
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:59,100
Well, why not?

443
00:22:59,167 --> 00:23:01,733
Because he thinks
this movie is a piece of shit.

444
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:04,933
He hates the script and more
importantly, he hates you.

445
00:23:05,067 --> 00:23:06,667
What're you talking about, Jake?

446
00:23:06,733 --> 00:23:08,833
I've known Sir Ian
since I was eight.

447
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:12,933
I used to mow his lawn.
We're practically family.

448
00:23:13,067 --> 00:23:17,067
So, you sneaky little
son of a bitch.

449
00:23:17,133 --> 00:23:18,667
Sir Ian. Sir Ian!

450
00:23:18,733 --> 00:23:21,233
Before you say anything,
I wanna introduce you to Tommy.

451
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:23,067
Comes to us from
the children's hospital

452
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:25,067
Courtesy of the End Of
The Rainbow Foundation.

453
00:23:25,133 --> 00:23:27,667
They wheeled him all
the way here to meet you.

454
00:23:27,733 --> 00:23:30,733
They wheeled him in, and they
can bloody well wheel him out.

455
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:33,900
'You and I have some business
to take care of, sparky.'

456
00:23:33,967 --> 00:23:35,833
Now you listen to me. Eh?

457
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,867
You know that
I'm a very busy man

458
00:23:37,933 --> 00:23:39,133
With a very busy schedule.

459
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,333
Movies, television shows,
personal appearances.

460
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:46,067
So, when the son of a dear
departed friend

461
00:23:46,067 --> 00:23:48,800
Of mine calls and
asks me to do him a favor

462
00:23:48,867 --> 00:23:52,633
'By appearing in
an independent family drama'

463
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:55,433
That is precisely
what I expect it to be.

464
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:58,067
Now it's revealed to me that
I've to burst into

465
00:23:58,067 --> 00:23:59,700
A papier mache castle

466
00:23:59,767 --> 00:24:04,067
Brandishing a real and
fully loaded AK-47 rifle

467
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:07,400
'Just to blow to bits a bunch
of slime covered hand puppets.'

468
00:24:07,467 --> 00:24:09,167
Take it easy, Sir Ian.

469
00:24:09,233 --> 00:24:11,467
It's a family drama of sorts.

470
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:15,433
After all, the Tiny Terrors
were all the spawn of Satan.

471
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:18,100
Not bloody likely, mate.

472
00:24:21,867 --> 00:24:25,900
So, who want to tour
the sound stages?

473
00:24:25,967 --> 00:24:28,233
'Gotta kill, gotta kill.
Where the hell am I?'

474
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,633
- I've had 'em done.
- 'Nice pair of cup cakes.'

475
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:33,067
[Gingerdead Man smacking lips]

476
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:34,700
'Eh, move it, asshole.'

477
00:24:34,767 --> 00:24:37,500
'I gotta get rid of this cookie
body. I'm getting stale.'

478
00:24:37,567 --> 00:24:42,133
Um, how do I transfer
my soul to a new host?

479
00:24:45,067 --> 00:24:48,067
What do you want me to do
with these satanic spell books?

480
00:24:48,133 --> 00:24:51,200
- Put them in the prop room.
- Oh, right, the prop room.

481
00:24:51,267 --> 00:24:52,733
Fucking prick.

482
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:55,267
Spell books?
How wonderfully contrived!

483
00:24:55,333 --> 00:24:57,267
[Laughing diabolically]

484
00:24:58,633 --> 00:25:00,600
'Oh, yeah.'

485
00:25:02,633 --> 00:25:04,067
[Screaming]

486
00:25:06,067 --> 00:25:07,633
You know, Dr. Callahan...

487
00:25:09,233 --> 00:25:11,967
- Damn it!
- 'Oh, I can't take it anymore.'

488
00:25:12,067 --> 00:25:14,767
I'm sorry, Ensign del Rio
but the only way to get

489
00:25:14,833 --> 00:25:16,733
This gestating creature
out of your body

490
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,867
Is with deliberate
and vigorous paddling.

491
00:25:18,933 --> 00:25:21,400
(Automated recording)
'Re-initiate
ass-paddle sequence.'

492
00:25:21,467 --> 00:25:23,300
Thank you, sister.

493
00:25:23,367 --> 00:25:25,133
[Screaming continues]

494
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,700
(Male #1)
'Work with us, del Rio,
work with us.'

495
00:25:27,767 --> 00:25:29,533
Don't you die on me,
you son-of-a-bitch.

496
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,933
Don't you die.
Let her have it.

497
00:25:33,067 --> 00:25:35,200
Take it easy back there,
you asshole!

498
00:25:35,267 --> 00:25:37,933
- 'Cut.'
- It freakin' hurts.

499
00:25:38,067 --> 00:25:40,667
Okay, everybody,
let's keep it moving.

500
00:25:40,733 --> 00:25:42,733
We got a lot to do.

501
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,967
Excuse me, Mr. DeCoteau,
how was that?

502
00:25:45,067 --> 00:25:46,333
'Was I good?'

503
00:25:48,267 --> 00:25:51,633
- Did you like what I did?
- Was it good?

504
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:53,767
Did I like it?

505
00:25:53,833 --> 00:25:56,733
- Was it in focus?
- 'As far as I could tell.'

506
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,533
Kid, you were fucking brilliant.

507
00:26:04,267 --> 00:26:05,867
(Gingerdead Man)
'Now, let's see.'

508
00:26:05,933 --> 00:26:09,367
"Powers of invisibility."
Ah, completely far fetched.

509
00:26:09,433 --> 00:26:12,500
"Reanimation of dead tissue?"
Ridiculous.

510
00:26:12,567 --> 00:26:14,067
"Bringing dolls to life?"

511
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:16,067
Sounds like
horse shit to me.

512
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:20,133
"Transmigrations. Soul to body
transferring spell.

513
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,800
"Place a drop of blood
from five separate victims

514
00:26:22,867 --> 00:26:25,067
On the points

Sort of. I got a call
from this company.

- They can use one of ours.

stay afloat for another day.

We might get a better signal.

What was that thing?

860
00:45:45,867 --> 00:45:49,100
That was, that was one
of your stupid puppets, right?

861
00:45:49,167 --> 00:45:51,200
What was it?

862
00:45:51,267 --> 00:45:53,867
Our puppets
never looked that ridiculous.

- Wait.
- 'What?'

879
00:46:44,667 --> 00:46:48,067

I was on my way to the car,

we know, we saw it.

'Where's, uh,
where's that thing from?'

899
00:48:14,233 --> 00:48:16,067
I don't know.

900
00:48:19,867 --> 00:48:22,433
What's, what's
that I smell?

901
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:25,433
It-it smells
like cinnamon extract.

902
00:48:26,733 --> 00:48:28,800
- Oh, he's coming.
- This can't be happening.

903

Pull yourself together.

906
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:38,700
We gotta stay inside and hide.

907
00:48:38,767 --> 00:48:42,233
I say, trying to get out now
is like a death sentence.

No, don't go. That thing
will tear you limb from limb.

909

We can escape. We're gonna be
trapped here like rats, c'mon.

'That I can't do this alone.'

Really?

Well, I've gotta say,
I'm feeling awkward here.

No, no, this
isn't awkward at all.

all I've ever wanted to do

Was be in the business.

1026
00:54:56,533 --> 00:54:59,433

I live with my mother, right?

1027
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:01,500
And I operate
out of her basement.

1028

Yeah.

00:55:04,167 --> 00:55:06,667
God, it feels so good
to finally talk about it.

1031

I'm down there
and she's all up in my ass
