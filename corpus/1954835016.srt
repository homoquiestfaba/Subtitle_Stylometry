1
00:01:34,461 --> 00:01:37,729
<i>- We begin today our celebration
of the sacrament of baptism.</i>

2
00:01:37,731 --> 00:01:42,067
<i>We pray for these children, set
them free from original sin</i>

3
00:01:42,069 --> 00:01:44,303
<i>make them</i>
<i>a temple of your glory</i>

4
00:01:44,305 --> 00:01:47,139
<i>and send the Holy Spirit</i>
<i>to dwell with them.</i>

5
00:01:47,141 --> 00:01:51,143
We ask this through
Christ our Lord. Amen.

6
00:01:51,145 --> 00:01:52,611
<i>- Look at Jenny with that baby.</i>

7
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:54,580
- Reject sin.

8
00:01:54,582 --> 00:01:56,248
- Don't start, Rose.

9
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:57,616
- Start what?

10
00:01:57,618 --> 00:02:00,986
- You know.

11
00:02:00,988 --> 00:02:03,388
- Well, look at her.

12
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:07,092
And that clock has started
ticking. What's she waiting for?

13
00:02:07,094 --> 00:02:08,527
- A husband.

14
00:02:08,529 --> 00:02:11,063
- I know that, Eddie.

15
00:02:11,065 --> 00:02:13,165
I just don't understand why
she hasn't found anybody yet.

16
00:02:13,167 --> 00:02:15,400
- Profess your faith
in Jesus Christ.

17
00:02:15,402 --> 00:02:17,636
This is the faith of the church.

18
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:22,074
This is the faith in which these
children are about to baptized.

19
00:02:22,076 --> 00:02:23,242
Do you reject Satan?

20
00:02:23,244 --> 00:02:25,544
- I do.
- I do.

21
00:02:25,546 --> 00:02:27,045
- And all his empty promises?

22
00:02:27,047 --> 00:02:28,981
- <i> I do.</i>
- <i> I do.</i>

23
00:02:28,983 --> 00:02:30,649
- And all his works?

24
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:32,384
- <i> I do.</i>
- <i> I do.</i>

25
00:02:32,386 --> 00:02:34,887
- You have to answer.

26
00:02:34,889 --> 00:02:37,422
- What if I don't
believe in Satan?

27
00:02:37,424 --> 00:02:41,260
Or that all the works
attributed to him are evil?

28
00:02:41,262 --> 00:02:43,328
- Oh just answer, will you?

29
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:45,931
- I do.

30
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:48,167
- What was that all about?

31
00:02:48,169 --> 00:02:50,769
- I don't know.

32
00:02:50,771 --> 00:02:52,971
- She feels guilty
about something.

33
00:02:53,773 --> 00:02:56,909
- Guilty? About what?

34
00:02:56,911 --> 00:03:00,412
- I don't know.
But she feels guilty.

35
00:03:05,619 --> 00:03:07,653
- And the bread's
on top of the microwave

36
00:03:07,655 --> 00:03:09,888
and it goes in the blue basket.

37
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:11,290
- I know where
the bread goes, Mom.

38
00:03:11,292 --> 00:03:12,558
I used to live here remember?

39
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,093
And I already
put it in the red basket.

40
00:03:15,095 --> 00:03:17,095
- But I always serve it
in the blue basket.

41
00:03:17,097 --> 00:03:18,463
- They're exactly the same.

42
00:03:18,465 --> 00:03:21,066
- But... they aren't.

43
00:03:21,068 --> 00:03:23,068
They're two different colors.

44
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:27,172
- Okay, I'll put
the bread in the blue basket.

45
00:03:27,174 --> 00:03:28,540
- Where's Jenny?

46
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:30,175
- Who knows? Mom and I
are doing all this ourselves.

47
00:03:30,177 --> 00:03:31,443
- I offered to help.

48
00:03:31,445 --> 00:03:32,978
- But we don't
want your help, it's your day.

49
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,980
And it's almost done anyway.

50
00:03:35,915 --> 00:03:36,949
-<i> Hey where you been?</i>

51
00:03:36,951 --> 00:03:38,917
I got somebody
I want you to meet.

52
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:41,220
- I don't have time, I have to
help Mom and Anne with the food.

53
00:03:41,222 --> 00:03:43,355
- No you don't,
you can help us clean up.

54
00:03:45,825 --> 00:03:47,926
- All you have to do
is say hello.

55
00:03:58,338 --> 00:04:00,973
- Hey Tommy, I want you
to meet my sister Jenny.

56
00:04:00,975 --> 00:04:02,207
- Hi.
- It's nice to meet you.

57
00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:03,709
Your brother has
told me so much about you.

58
00:04:03,711 --> 00:04:05,944
- Tommy just transferred here
from our New York office.

59
00:04:05,946 --> 00:04:07,813
- Oh, New York,
that's a big change.

60
00:04:07,815 --> 00:04:09,047
But I'm sure
you'll love Cleveland.

61
00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:11,950
It's got a very
rich cultural heritage.

62
00:04:11,952 --> 00:04:13,852
- Look I've
got to leave but, um...

63
00:04:13,854 --> 00:04:15,254
would it be alright
if I called you sometime?

64
00:04:15,256 --> 00:04:17,256
- Yeah. Sure. Sure.

65
00:04:19,692 --> 00:04:21,193
- Yeah, don't bother calling.

66
00:04:21,195 --> 00:04:22,761
- Why not?

67
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:24,763
- She won't call back.

68
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,268
- Strike 43.

69
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:30,402
- Oh, shut up, Anne.

70
00:04:30,404 --> 00:04:31,470
- I don't know
why we keep trying.

71
00:04:31,472 --> 00:04:33,105
That guy is cute.

72
00:04:33,107 --> 00:04:35,707
If you keep on being so picky
you're going to end up alone.

73
00:04:35,709 --> 00:04:37,009
- You know...

74
00:04:37,011 --> 00:04:38,577
did it ever occur to you
that I might actually

75
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:41,280
be in a relationship
with somebody?

76
00:04:41,282 --> 00:04:43,282
- No, are you?

77
00:04:45,251 --> 00:04:46,785
- It doesn't matter
if I am or I'm not.

78
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:49,087
Why does everybody
always assume I'm not?

79
00:04:49,089 --> 00:04:52,791
- Because you never bring anybody
home and you never mention it.

80
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:54,559
The only people we've
ever met are your roommate

81
00:04:54,561 --> 00:04:58,297
and that pack of friends
you do everything with.

82
00:04:58,299 --> 00:05:00,766
If there is somebody,
what's wrong with him?

83
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:04,870
He's married isn't he?

84
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,146
-<i> She said it?</i>

85
00:05:14,148 --> 00:05:15,647
- No, but she didn't deny it.

86
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:17,716
And I could tell from her face.

87
00:05:17,718 --> 00:05:20,619
- Ah, I just don't believe
she'd do something like that.

88
00:05:20,621 --> 00:05:22,454
I hope he doesn't have kids.

89
00:05:22,456 --> 00:05:23,889
Do you know how long
it's been going on?

90
00:05:23,891 --> 00:05:28,627
- What are you
doing out there, Frankie?

91
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:30,629
- Just making some phone calls.

92
00:05:33,766 --> 00:05:35,133
- She's not going
to tell me anything.

93
00:05:35,135 --> 00:05:37,035
I have everything she wants.

94
00:05:37,037 --> 00:05:39,037
2 kids and a husband.

95
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:41,540
- I know.

96
00:05:43,443 --> 00:05:46,712
- I am not involved
with a married man.

97
00:05:46,714 --> 00:05:47,879
- Good.

98
00:05:49,315 --> 00:05:52,417
Not that you're going
to do what I say anymore.

99
00:05:52,419 --> 00:05:57,289
At your age what you do
is... is your business.

100
00:05:57,291 --> 00:06:00,359
Like me. Sitting here.

101
00:06:00,361 --> 00:06:03,595
Having a quiet smoke
that nobody needs to know about.

102
00:06:03,597 --> 00:06:06,298
- Have I ever told on you?

103
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,466
- No.

104
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:11,069
- That Anne has
such a big mouth.

105
00:06:11,071 --> 00:06:12,938
If she has to gossip
about something

106
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:14,840
she should at least
get her story straight.

107
00:06:14,842 --> 00:06:16,641
- You should leave Anne alone.

108
00:06:16,643 --> 00:06:17,976
You don't know
what it's like being married

109
00:06:17,978 --> 00:06:19,945
to a guy like Frankie.

110
00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:24,349
- I don't know what it's
like to be married at all.

111
00:06:24,351 --> 00:06:26,051
- You sound like
that's what you want.

112
00:06:26,053 --> 00:06:28,220
- Doesn't everybody?

113
00:06:28,222 --> 00:06:30,789
- I guess.

114
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:32,224
It's probably why
they don't always do it

115
00:06:32,226 --> 00:06:34,025
for the right reasons.

116
00:06:34,027 --> 00:06:36,762
- What's the right reasons?
Somebody's got your back?

117
00:06:36,764 --> 00:06:39,197
- What are you a Marine?

118
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,467
No, it's because you...

119
00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:44,503
you meet the right person.

120
00:06:45,638 --> 00:06:48,607
And when you meet
the right person you...

121
00:06:48,609 --> 00:06:49,775
you go the distance.

122
00:06:49,777 --> 00:06:51,943
And let me tell you
about the distance.

123
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,915
Everybody changes.

124
00:06:56,917 --> 00:07:01,620
But if you're with the
right person and they change...

125
00:07:01,622 --> 00:07:03,742
you meet the right
person all over again.

126
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,364
- Well, Anne did
get something right.

127
00:07:12,366 --> 00:07:15,400
I am seeing somebody.

128
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:18,637
- Yeah? Who?

129
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:22,474
- Just somebody but...

130
00:07:22,476 --> 00:07:25,444
it is the right person.

131
00:07:25,446 --> 00:07:27,446
- So when's the wedding?

132
00:07:29,816 --> 00:07:32,083
- I don't know.

133
00:07:32,085 --> 00:07:34,085
And I'm cold. Going in, okay?

134
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:37,189
- Okay.

135
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:50,435
- Jenny?

136
00:07:50,437 --> 00:07:51,670
-<i> Yeah?</i>

137
00:07:51,672 --> 00:07:54,506
- Come here,
I want to talk to you.

138
00:07:54,508 --> 00:07:56,341
- Anne got it all wrong.

139
00:07:56,343 --> 00:07:57,776
I told her she didn't
know anything about

140
00:07:57,778 --> 00:08:01,079
my private life, not that
I was dating a married man.

141
00:08:01,081 --> 00:08:04,449
- Oh, well,
I'm glad to hear that.

142
00:08:04,451 --> 00:08:06,351
- You believe me
just like that?

143
00:08:06,353 --> 00:08:09,654
- Of course I believe you.
You never lie.

144
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:11,189
- You know...

145
00:08:11,191 --> 00:08:14,125
it's time for you to start
thinking about what you want.

146
00:08:14,127 --> 00:08:16,394
- What?
- The china or the crystal.

147
00:08:16,396 --> 00:08:19,164
I'm giving the silver
to Michael and Lorraine

148
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:20,665
so you and Anne have to decide

149
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:22,334
who wants the china
and who wants the crystal.

150
00:08:22,336 --> 00:08:24,736
- You mean when you're dead?
- Yes.

151
00:08:24,738 --> 00:08:26,671
- I don't want to
have this conversation, Mom.

152
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:28,373
- Well, maybe not
but this isn't something

153
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:32,844
you can just leave
'till the last minute.

154
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:35,614
What are you doing?
I'll drop the glasses.

155
00:08:35,616 --> 00:08:38,650
- I love you, Mom.

156
00:08:38,652 --> 00:08:40,552
- I love you too.

157
00:08:40,554 --> 00:08:41,753
But if you don't let go

158
00:08:41,755 --> 00:08:46,057
there won't be
any glasses to give away.

159
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:48,260
The truth is I'm hoping
you take the crystal.

160
00:08:48,262 --> 00:08:50,562
- Why?

161
00:08:50,564 --> 00:08:52,397
- Anne's like your father,
they're careless.

162
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:55,333
It'll all be broken in a month.

163
00:08:55,335 --> 00:08:57,302
But you take care
of your things.

164
00:08:57,304 --> 00:08:59,304
You're like me.

165
00:09:01,574 --> 00:09:04,576
What makes you think the guy
isn't serious about her?

166
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:10,582
- I don't know. She... she
didn't want to talk about it.

167
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:17,522
I'm a fireman,
you know, I know men.

168
00:09:17,524 --> 00:09:18,957
I can hear these
guys on the phone

169
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:21,860
stringing these girls along.

170
00:09:21,862 --> 00:09:24,329
I'm telling you,
even if she's ready

171
00:09:24,331 --> 00:09:25,897
this guy hasn't
stepped up to the plate

172
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:27,899
and she doesn't
think he's going to.

173
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:34,139
- I wonder
why she didn't tell me.

174
00:09:34,141 --> 00:09:37,475
- Oh, she didn't really
tell me, it just kind of...

175
00:09:37,477 --> 00:09:42,847
slipped out,
and then she was sorry it did.

176
00:09:42,849 --> 00:09:45,850
- She's always
been so secretive.

177
00:09:45,852 --> 00:09:48,119
- Not when she was little.

178
00:09:48,121 --> 00:09:50,755
She was really open
when she was little.

179
00:09:53,192 --> 00:09:56,194
- Yeah. She was.

180
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,531
I wonder what happened.

181
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,168
- Who knows?

182
00:10:22,054 --> 00:10:26,625
- Uh-oh. Potato chips?
Bad time at the old homestead?

183
00:10:26,627 --> 00:10:27,826
- It was okay.

184
00:10:27,828 --> 00:10:28,927
- You didn't have
the traditional

185
00:10:28,929 --> 00:10:30,762
fight with your sister?

186
00:10:30,764 --> 00:10:32,497
- No, but we came close.

187
00:10:32,499 --> 00:10:35,000
She told everyone
I was dating a married man.

188
00:10:35,002 --> 00:10:39,337
- Oh, and your brother didn't
try to fix you up again?

189
00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:40,572
- He did.

190
00:10:40,574 --> 00:10:42,574
With a very cute guy this time.

191
00:10:45,077 --> 00:10:46,945
I need to talk to you.

192
00:10:46,947 --> 00:10:48,113
- Well, I hope you
want to talk about

193
00:10:48,115 --> 00:10:49,447
getting another roommate in here

194
00:10:49,449 --> 00:10:51,282
because I don't think
I can afford this place

195
00:10:51,284 --> 00:10:52,951
much longer if we don't.

196
00:10:52,953 --> 00:10:56,187
- No, that's not it.

197
00:10:56,189 --> 00:10:58,857
I've decided...

198
00:10:58,859 --> 00:11:01,226
I want to get married.

199
00:11:01,228 --> 00:11:03,328
- Wow.

200
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:06,164
- And have a family.

201
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:10,201
- I never thought
I would hear you say that.

202
00:11:14,273 --> 00:11:15,874
What happened?

203
00:11:15,876 --> 00:11:18,610
- I was talking with my dad
tonight and the things he said

204
00:11:18,612 --> 00:11:22,747
it... it made me realize
how much I'm missing.

205
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:28,153
- Did you tell him
who you want to marry?

206
00:11:29,955 --> 00:11:31,289
- No.

207
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:34,693
- Well, don't you think
you should tell them

208
00:11:34,695 --> 00:11:37,429
you're marrying me
before the ceremony?

209
00:11:42,501 --> 00:11:46,004
- Marian's daughter
is back in rehab.

210
00:11:46,006 --> 00:11:50,208
Son-in-law disappeared and
they have the grandchildren.

211
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:51,543
- Poor Marian.

212
00:11:51,545 --> 00:11:55,080
- It's her own fault,
she never put the time in.

213
00:11:55,082 --> 00:11:56,981
- We've been lucky
with our kids, Ellen.

214
00:11:56,983 --> 00:11:59,884
- It wasn't luck.
It was hard work.

215
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:01,920
Who else is gonna
teach them right from wrong?

216
00:12:01,922 --> 00:12:04,289
- This would look
good on Anne. I'll get two.

217
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:06,324
- How are she
and Frankie doing?

218
00:12:06,326 --> 00:12:08,626
- Oh, the same,
and she has to put up

219
00:12:08,628 --> 00:12:11,396
with that family of his too.

220
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:14,132
- That girl's
got her crosses to bear.

221
00:12:14,134 --> 00:12:15,500
- Has Karen found a job?

222
00:12:15,502 --> 00:12:20,305
- Oh, not yet.
It's hard with two kids.

223
00:12:20,307 --> 00:12:23,041
I said I'd take care of them,
but she is a good mother.

224
00:12:23,043 --> 00:12:24,843
She wants to be with them.

225
00:12:24,845 --> 00:12:26,277
- What about Bobby?

226
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:31,082
- Well, he can't take
a job while he's trying

227
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:34,185
to raise money
to open his own repair shop.

228
00:12:34,187 --> 00:12:36,654
It takes all his energy.

229
00:12:36,656 --> 00:12:38,690
But at least they
are a happy couple

230
00:12:38,692 --> 00:12:41,960
and that's the most
important thing. How's Jenny?

231
00:12:41,962 --> 00:12:44,229
- Jenny's fine.

232
00:12:44,231 --> 00:12:47,265
And I think
she's finally found someone.

233
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:50,502
- No! Is it serious?
- I think it is.

234
00:12:50,504 --> 00:12:52,904
She said she wants to
talk to us about something.

235
00:12:52,906 --> 00:12:55,874
- Then it's serious.

236
00:12:55,876 --> 00:12:58,143
- <i> The guy's a bum,</i>
<i>that's all I know.</i>

237
00:12:58,145 --> 00:12:59,144
- How do you know that?

238
00:12:59,146 --> 00:13:00,678
- Because we haven't met him.

239
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:03,381
What kind of guy doesn't want to
meet his girlfriend's family?

240
00:13:03,383 --> 00:13:06,518
- A bum. What's he do?

241
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,986
- I don't know.
She doesn't talk about him.

242
00:13:07,988 --> 00:13:10,355
I don't even know his name.

243
00:13:10,357 --> 00:13:11,623
Anyway she does say she's got

244
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:13,057
something important to tell us.

245
00:13:13,059 --> 00:13:16,494
- Well it sounds like this
is it. He popped the question.

246
00:13:16,496 --> 00:13:17,495
- Maybe.

247
00:13:17,497 --> 00:13:19,297
- It could be okay, Eddie.

248
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:21,299
Jenny's a good girl.

249
00:13:22,668 --> 00:13:25,170
- You know, you gotta
lose some weight.

250
00:13:25,172 --> 00:13:27,438
- Why? I don't
climb ladders anymore.

251
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,473
- They'll bust you.

252
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:31,075
- Yeah, well.

253
00:13:31,077 --> 00:13:32,610
- You coming over
for a drink later?

254
00:13:32,612 --> 00:13:35,947
- Ellen and I wouldn't
miss your anniversary party.

255
00:13:35,949 --> 00:13:37,949
Little taste.

256
00:13:42,888 --> 00:13:45,557
- More onions.
Okay. I'll see ya later.

257
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:46,724
- Alright.

258
00:13:49,563 --> 00:13:52,897
- No, I'm not okay.
I'm still... carsick.

259
00:13:52,899 --> 00:13:55,133
Once it starts
it just doesn't stop.

260
00:13:55,135 --> 00:13:58,203
- You're not carsick, you're
just afraid to go in there.

261
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:01,172
- So what if I am?

262
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:02,740
- So you won't
be able to do this

263
00:14:02,742 --> 00:14:05,310
if you're going
in ashamed of who you are.

264
00:14:05,312 --> 00:14:07,612
- I'm not, I'm not
ashamed of who I am.

265
00:14:07,614 --> 00:14:10,815
- You always say that,
but I'm still kind of confused

266
00:14:10,817 --> 00:14:13,585
as to why you've told
everybody except your family.

267
00:14:13,587 --> 00:14:17,355
- Because they live in a small
world and they like it in there

268
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:20,792
and I've just never
found the right time to...

269
00:14:20,794 --> 00:14:22,794
drop the bomb.

270
00:14:25,731 --> 00:14:30,535
- You've been lying
for a long time.

271
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:33,638
That's what you're
really afraid of.

272
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:36,674
When you tell them it's gonna
change the way they see you.

273
00:14:42,681 --> 00:14:44,148
You need to do this on your own.

274
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:46,751
- What? -It's between
you and your parents.

275
00:14:46,753 --> 00:14:48,987
I'll just be in the way.

276
00:14:48,989 --> 00:14:51,155
Just call me when it's done.

277
00:15:16,715 --> 00:15:17,882
-<i> Jenny?</i>

278
00:15:17,884 --> 00:15:19,918
- Yeah. It's me.
- <i> Yeah I know.</i>

279
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,653
Ah, where's Kitty?

280
00:15:21,655 --> 00:15:26,024
- Oh, she... she had
to go cause there was, um...

281
00:15:26,026 --> 00:15:28,192
an emergency
at the school. Yeah, I think.

282
00:15:28,194 --> 00:15:30,595
- What kind of emergency?
- A flood.

283
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:33,932
- A flood? What's she
gonna do about a flood?

284
00:15:33,934 --> 00:15:35,466
- I don't know.

285
00:15:35,468 --> 00:15:36,567
Happy anniversary.

286
00:15:36,569 --> 00:15:38,436
- Oh, thank you.

287
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:39,871
- Alright, come on.
- Okay.

288
00:15:39,873 --> 00:15:41,306
-<i> Jenny's here everybody.</i>

289
00:15:41,308 --> 00:15:43,708
- Jenny's here.
- Oh! Finally Jenny's here.

290
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:45,810
- Ta-da!
- Jenny.

291
00:15:45,812 --> 00:15:47,178
- Where's Kitty?

292
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:49,647
- Ah, she had to take care
of a flood at the school.

293
00:15:49,649 --> 00:15:51,282
- What does Kitty
know about floods?

294
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:52,517
- Can I talk to you upstairs?

295
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:54,519
There's something
I need to tell you.

296
00:16:07,566 --> 00:16:09,667
- Please say something, Jenny.

297
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:15,440
We thought you were going to
tell us you're getting married.

298
00:16:15,442 --> 00:16:17,275
But it doesn't
look like that now.

299
00:16:17,277 --> 00:16:19,711
What happened, honey,
did you break up?

300
00:16:19,713 --> 00:16:22,113
- No.

301
00:16:22,115 --> 00:16:23,748
- Then what is it?

302
00:16:26,018 --> 00:16:27,285
What do you want to tell me?

303
00:16:27,287 --> 00:16:29,554
- This isn't gonna
be easy for you.

304
00:16:29,556 --> 00:16:32,223
- Are you sick?
- No.

305
00:16:32,225 --> 00:16:33,324
- Then what is it, honey?

306
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:35,393
What could possibly
be so hard for me?

307
00:16:35,395 --> 00:16:37,395
- I'm gay.

308
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:39,731
- What?

309
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,301
- I'm gay, Mom.

310
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:46,337
- You're...

311
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:51,709
What?

312
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:54,679
- I'm a lesbian.

313
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:56,314
I'm gay.

314
00:16:56,316 --> 00:16:57,482
- But...

315
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:01,586
But what about the guy?

316
00:17:01,588 --> 00:17:04,989
- There is no guy.
There's never been a guy.

317
00:17:04,991 --> 00:17:08,593
All these years... you
made them up and I...

318
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,929
I just went along with it.

319
00:17:14,967 --> 00:17:16,667
- But...

320
00:17:16,669 --> 00:17:18,102
But I don't... I don't...
I don't understand.

321
00:17:18,104 --> 00:17:19,137
Um.

322
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:25,610
How long have you known this?

323
00:17:25,612 --> 00:17:28,513
- Always.
- And I missed it?

324
00:17:28,515 --> 00:17:30,782
How did... how could I
miss something like this?

325
00:17:30,784 --> 00:17:35,053
- You wanted to. You didn't
want to know and I knew that.

326
00:17:35,055 --> 00:17:36,220
Didn't you ever wonder

327
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:39,223
why you never met
any of these boyfriends?

328
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:41,526
- Ah, you always broke up
with them before I could.

329
00:17:41,528 --> 00:17:42,794
- No, I didn't.

330
00:17:42,796 --> 00:17:47,532
I just... let you think
what you wanted to think.

331
00:17:47,534 --> 00:17:50,968
- I thought you were...
You were waiting. I...

332
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:52,837
- For what?

333
00:17:52,839 --> 00:17:54,906
- I thought...

334
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:59,043
What did we do wrong?
- Nothing.

335
00:17:59,045 --> 00:18:00,511
You didn't do anything wrong.

336
00:18:00,513 --> 00:18:03,414
This is just... how I am.

337
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:05,850
- But you're...

338
00:18:05,852 --> 00:18:08,319
But you're...
You're like me, you know?

339
00:18:09,721 --> 00:18:11,923
We even like the same things.

340
00:18:11,925 --> 00:18:15,460
I always, I always
thought you were like me.

341
00:18:15,462 --> 00:18:17,895
- That hasn't changed.

342
00:18:17,897 --> 00:18:21,566
I am like you.
I'm still the same person, Mom.

343
00:18:22,034 --> 00:18:23,534
- No.

344
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:26,104
You're not.

345
00:18:27,806 --> 00:18:30,975
You've been
lying to me for years.

346
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:41,986
Your father will have to know
and you should tell him.

347
00:18:41,988 --> 00:18:43,855
- I was going to
tell you both at the same time

348
00:18:43,857 --> 00:18:46,157
but everybody was staring at me.

349
00:18:47,826 --> 00:18:50,862
He needs to know before, uh...

350
00:18:50,864 --> 00:18:53,030
Before I tell everybody else.

351
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:56,534
- You're telling other people?

352
00:18:56,536 --> 00:18:58,936
- I have to tell
Anne and Michael.

353
00:18:58,938 --> 00:19:00,905
I'm going to tell everybody.

354
00:19:02,374 --> 00:19:04,842
Kitty and I want
to get married, Mom.

355
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:12,617
- You're marrying
your roommate?

356
00:19:12,619 --> 00:19:15,119
- She's not my roommate.

357
00:19:15,121 --> 00:19:18,723
We've been partners
for five years now and...

358
00:19:18,725 --> 00:19:20,791
we want to start a family.

359
00:19:20,793 --> 00:19:22,293
- A family?

360
00:19:22,295 --> 00:19:25,329
- Yeah. It's what you're
always talking about, isn't it?

361
00:19:26,298 --> 00:19:28,432
And we want a big wedding.

362
00:19:28,434 --> 00:19:29,634
With everybody there.

363
00:19:29,636 --> 00:19:31,369
Friends and family.

364
00:19:31,371 --> 00:19:33,471
We want a wedding like
Anne and Michael had.

365
00:19:33,473 --> 00:19:36,774
I want... I want
you and Dad to give me away.

366
00:19:40,612 --> 00:19:43,381
- Do what you're gonna do.

367
00:19:43,383 --> 00:19:47,251
But I'm asking you,
for my sake...

368
00:19:47,253 --> 00:19:49,620
not to tell everybody else.

369
00:19:49,622 --> 00:19:51,055
Not yet.

370
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:53,291
- Why?

371
00:19:55,227 --> 00:19:58,229
- 'Cause if you do nothing
will ever be the same again.

372
00:19:58,231 --> 00:20:01,265
- Nothing is
the same anymore, Mom.

373
00:20:01,267 --> 00:20:04,869
- Maybe not for you but...
but your life isn't here anymore

374
00:20:04,871 --> 00:20:06,938
and if you don't like
what happens you can go away.

375
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:08,973
I can't.

376
00:20:08,975 --> 00:20:12,243
This place, these people,
they're my life

377
00:20:12,245 --> 00:20:15,880
and I have to stay here.
I have to live with them.

378
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:20,518
Oh, I love you, Jenny.
Nothing could ever change that.

379
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:24,589
But I have a life too and you
can't just change my life on me.

380
00:20:31,697 --> 00:20:34,832
- It's not like
I'm living in the past, I'm not.

381
00:20:34,834 --> 00:20:38,069
I know times have changed,
anything goes these days.

382
00:20:38,071 --> 00:20:40,638
I read the papers, I watch TV.

383
00:20:42,474 --> 00:20:43,941
But...

384
00:20:43,943 --> 00:20:47,812
But I don't know personally,
anybody in this neighborhood

385
00:20:47,814 --> 00:20:49,647
whose children have...

386
00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:53,050
you know...

387
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:58,723
- Maybe they all left.
- What?

388
00:20:58,725 --> 00:21:01,525
- The neighborhood, maybe
they left the neighborhood.

389
00:21:01,527 --> 00:21:02,927
- I'm sure they did.

390
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:04,428
- And the lying,
all that lying.

391
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:07,164
Even though I know
why you did it

392
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:08,766
it's still
a hard pill to swallow.

393
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:11,769
And now a wedding.

394
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:14,071
Starting a family.

395
00:21:14,073 --> 00:21:18,276
I mean... we're... we're
ordinary people

396
00:21:18,278 --> 00:21:20,278
not, you know... rebels.

397
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,280
- Neither am I.

398
00:21:22,282 --> 00:21:25,149
I just want
what you gave Anne and Michael.

399
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:30,421
I only did this because of you.

400
00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:32,223
- What?

401
00:21:32,225 --> 00:21:34,458
- You told me
if you meet the right person

402
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,761
you should go
the distance, and I did.

403
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:41,599
I met the right person.

404
00:21:41,601 --> 00:21:42,733
Kitty.

405
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:47,638
That's why I asked her to marry
me and now you're asking me

406
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:50,107
to hide it from my own family.

407
00:21:52,077 --> 00:21:54,979
- If you tell them
you'll hurt your mother.

408
00:21:54,981 --> 00:21:57,448
- If I don't it will hurt me.

409
00:21:59,184 --> 00:22:01,185
What would you do?

410
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:05,956
- I don't know.

411
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:30,247
- Will someone please
tell me what's going on here?

412
00:22:30,249 --> 00:22:32,783
- You really wanna know?
- Why else would I ask?

413
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:40,558
- The married man
and I broke up.

414
00:22:42,394 --> 00:22:44,395
- I knew I was right about that.

415
00:22:46,998 --> 00:22:49,567
How come?

416
00:22:49,569 --> 00:22:53,437
- He decided to
stay with his wife.

417
00:22:53,439 --> 00:22:57,241
Well, I'm sorry, Jens. But he
sounds like a bastard to me.

418
00:22:57,243 --> 00:22:59,977
I think you dodged a bullet.

419
00:22:59,979 --> 00:23:01,512
You don't want to
spend the rest of your life

420
00:23:01,514 --> 00:23:03,914
living with a liar do you?

421
00:23:03,916 --> 00:23:07,618
- No. But sometimes
you have to.

422
00:23:08,587 --> 00:23:09,720
I'll fill the water glasses.

423
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:12,456
- I knew I was
right about the married man.

424
00:23:33,145 --> 00:23:35,246
- Well?

425
00:23:35,248 --> 00:23:37,748
- You did it.
- I did it.

426
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,550
- Are you... okay?

427
00:23:39,552 --> 00:23:41,018
- Yeah.

428
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:42,887
Even though I lied to my sister.

429
00:23:42,889 --> 00:23:44,989
I am.

430
00:23:44,991 --> 00:23:47,024
Thanks.

431
00:23:47,026 --> 00:23:50,194
Telling my parents feels like...

432
00:23:50,196 --> 00:23:52,229
being let out of prison.

433
00:23:55,534 --> 00:23:59,737
- Look, if you've
changed your mind

434
00:23:59,739 --> 00:24:02,540
about getting married...

435
00:24:02,542 --> 00:24:05,443
I'm okay with that.

436
00:24:05,445 --> 00:24:08,145
- Why would I change
my mind about getting married?

437
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:13,651
- Your family. I know how
important they are to you.

438
00:24:13,653 --> 00:24:17,688
- No. My family
is not marrying you, I am.

439
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:19,457
And I have never
been more certain

440
00:24:19,459 --> 00:24:22,460
about anything in my entire life
than I am about marrying you.

441
00:24:37,075 --> 00:24:39,043
- I wonder who proposed.

442
00:24:40,345 --> 00:24:43,113
- She did.

443
00:24:43,115 --> 00:24:44,381
- She did.

444
00:24:46,184 --> 00:24:49,954
She said, "Kitty,
will you marry me?"

445
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,991
"Kitty let's start a family."

446
00:24:56,728 --> 00:24:59,597
All these years
living a secret life.

447
00:25:04,803 --> 00:25:07,071
I thought I knew her.

448
00:25:07,073 --> 00:25:09,373
Then I find out
I don't know her at all.

449
00:25:12,143 --> 00:25:13,344
- She's...

450
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:15,613
She's the same person.

451
00:25:15,615 --> 00:25:18,315
She just left
a few things out, that's all.

452
00:25:18,317 --> 00:25:20,651
- Oh, Eddie, what she
left out is who she is.

453
00:25:20,653 --> 00:25:22,853
Being private
isn't the same as lying.

454
00:25:22,855 --> 00:25:25,890
- Well, you just
asked her to keep on lying

455
00:25:25,892 --> 00:25:28,592
so let's stop
talking about the lying part.

456
00:25:28,594 --> 00:25:30,094
- I never asked her to lie.

457
00:25:30,096 --> 00:25:32,329
All I did was ask her
not to tell everybody.

458
00:25:32,331 --> 00:25:35,266
She didn't have to lie to Anne.

459
00:25:35,268 --> 00:25:37,501
And... and now that she's ready
to tell the whole world

460
00:25:37,503 --> 00:25:41,105
the truth, we're just supposed
to go along with it.

461
00:25:41,107 --> 00:25:43,140
You remember our daughter Jenny,
don't you?

462
00:25:43,142 --> 00:25:45,042
Well, guess what, she's a
completely different person.

463
00:25:45,044 --> 00:25:47,611
- Well, let's just drop it okay

464
00:25:47,613 --> 00:25:50,893
because you know, she's doing what you
wanted her to do and that's that.

465
00:25:55,787 --> 00:25:58,856
- We have a life too, don't we?

466
00:25:58,858 --> 00:26:00,457
- Yes.

467
00:26:00,459 --> 00:26:03,527
- This isn't just about her.

468
00:26:03,529 --> 00:26:04,828
- No.

469
00:26:08,266 --> 00:26:12,136
- What do you think
I should have done?

470
00:26:12,138 --> 00:26:14,204
- All you can do...

471
00:26:14,206 --> 00:26:16,206
is what you do.

472
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:19,343
- What?

473
00:26:19,345 --> 00:26:22,613
- All you can do
is what you do.

474
00:26:22,615 --> 00:26:24,515
- What does that mean?

475
00:26:24,517 --> 00:26:26,917
- It means what it means.

476
00:26:38,363 --> 00:26:40,230
- Hello?

477
00:26:40,232 --> 00:26:41,699
-<i> Hi, Mom. It's me.</i>

478
00:26:41,701 --> 00:26:44,134
- Jenny. How are you?

479
00:26:44,136 --> 00:26:47,037
- I'm good, how are you?
- I'm fine.

480
00:26:51,743 --> 00:26:53,043
How are things?

481
00:26:53,045 --> 00:26:56,046
- Great. Things are great.

482
00:26:56,048 --> 00:26:58,048
How are things with you?

483
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:01,151
- Things are great.

484
00:27:03,855 --> 00:27:08,592
- Well. I... I better go.

485
00:27:08,594 --> 00:27:11,795
- Okay, dear. Have a nice day.

486
00:27:13,365 --> 00:27:15,766
- You have a nice day too.

487
00:27:15,768 --> 00:27:18,335
- I love you.

488
00:27:18,337 --> 00:27:20,337
- Love you too.

489
00:27:43,395 --> 00:27:45,596
- Why are we doing this?
I'm freezing.

490
00:27:45,598 --> 00:27:47,731
- It was your idea
to get more exercise.

491
00:27:47,733 --> 00:27:50,768
- No it wasn't. It was Jenny's.

492
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:52,169
Okay I'm done.

493
00:27:53,972 --> 00:27:55,606
How is Jenny by the way?

494
00:27:55,608 --> 00:27:57,775
- Jenny. Jenny's fine.

495
00:27:59,711 --> 00:28:02,880
- She looked strange
at your anniversary party.

496
00:28:02,882 --> 00:28:04,348
- Did she?

497
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:06,116
- Unhappy.

498
00:28:06,118 --> 00:28:08,118
- I didn't see it.

499
00:28:10,789 --> 00:28:14,391
- Anne told Karen
about the married man.

500
00:28:14,393 --> 00:28:15,859
- Anne has a big mouth.

501
00:28:15,861 --> 00:28:17,695
- They weren't gossiping.

502
00:28:17,697 --> 00:28:20,064
Our girls are like sisters.

503
00:28:21,966 --> 00:28:23,400
Did you ever meet him?

504
00:28:23,402 --> 00:28:25,235
- No.

505
00:28:25,237 --> 00:28:27,938
- Well, at least it's over.

506
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:30,040
Anyway, that's what Karen said.

507
00:28:32,177 --> 00:28:35,012
- It is, isn't it?
- What?

508
00:28:35,014 --> 00:28:38,015
- Over.
- Yes.

509
00:28:40,819 --> 00:28:43,587
- Why are you acting so weird?

510
00:28:43,589 --> 00:28:45,456
- How am I acting weird?

511
00:28:45,458 --> 00:28:47,291
- All secretive.

512
00:28:47,293 --> 00:28:51,028
Like, I'm sticking my nose
in your business.

513
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:53,263
We've been talking
to each other about everything

514
00:28:53,265 --> 00:28:57,668
for 45 years and
Jenny is like one of my own.

515
00:28:57,670 --> 00:29:00,170
- I know that, Ellen. I know.

516
00:29:00,172 --> 00:29:04,208
- Then why are you
acting like I'm a busybody?

517
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:06,543
- I'm upset.

518
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:10,748
About the married man.

519
00:29:13,017 --> 00:29:15,085
- It's probably just a phase.

520
00:29:17,055 --> 00:29:20,724
Is it somebody she works with?

521
00:29:20,726 --> 00:29:21,859
Not her boss?

522
00:29:21,861 --> 00:29:24,394
- No, not her boss.
It's another...

523
00:29:25,997 --> 00:29:27,698
Another social worker.

524
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:31,502
- Any kids?
- No, no kids, let's go.

525
00:29:31,504 --> 00:29:33,270
- Well, that's a blessing.

526
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:37,474
Oh, don't worry too much, Rose.

527
00:29:37,476 --> 00:29:40,310
She's gonna be fine,
she's got you.

528
00:29:50,488 --> 00:29:52,289
- Dad. What are you doing here?

529
00:29:52,291 --> 00:29:54,858
- Well, I was
in the neighborhood.

530
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:57,261
- You never come over here.

531
00:29:57,263 --> 00:30:01,231
- Well, I, uh...
I had to buy some equipment.

532
00:30:01,233 --> 00:30:03,500
- What kind of equipment
do they sell around here?

533
00:30:03,502 --> 00:30:06,036
- Well, you know,
just equipment stuff.

534
00:30:06,038 --> 00:30:07,471
It's not worth talking about.

535
00:30:07,473 --> 00:30:09,807
You wanna have some lunch
or is this a bad time for you?

536
00:30:09,809 --> 00:30:12,309
- No, I'm starving...

537
00:30:12,311 --> 00:30:15,612
and it is always
a bad time around here.

538
00:30:15,614 --> 00:30:17,514
The last stop for kids
nobody wants

539
00:30:17,516 --> 00:30:20,851
and... I'm supposed
to find homes for them all.

540
00:30:20,853 --> 00:30:23,620
- Well, you always do.

541
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:28,025
- You have too high
an opinion of me, Dad.

542
00:30:33,464 --> 00:30:35,799
- Michael's coming around to help
re-build the fence next week.

543
00:30:35,801 --> 00:30:37,334
- Yeah, he mentioned that.
- Yeah.

544
00:30:37,336 --> 00:30:39,570
What about Anne and Frankie,
you seen them?

545
00:30:39,572 --> 00:30:42,272
- Not in a couple of weeks.

546
00:30:42,274 --> 00:30:44,942
- They're, um, they're going
away next weekend

547
00:30:44,944 --> 00:30:46,844
they asked us
to look after the kids.

548
00:30:46,846 --> 00:30:49,646
But we've got
the bowling tournament so, uh...

549
00:30:49,648 --> 00:30:52,850
so I guess they'll ask,
uh, Michael and Lorraine.

550
00:30:52,852 --> 00:30:54,918
- They asked us.

551
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:58,956
- Well, those kids
are crazy about you.

552
00:30:58,958 --> 00:31:00,958
- No, it's Kitty
that they love.

553
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,126
<i>She's really fantastic</i>
<i>with kids.</i>

554
00:31:06,164 --> 00:31:08,632
- So, uh, it's almost
Turkey Day.

555
00:31:08,634 --> 00:31:10,601
Your favorite holiday.

556
00:31:10,603 --> 00:31:13,570
- Yeah, I hope I can cook
one as good as Mom does.

557
00:31:14,939 --> 00:31:17,875
- Well, you're... you're
gonna cook your own?

558
00:31:17,877 --> 00:31:19,209
- Yeah.

559
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:22,905
Yeah, Kitty and I are gonna have
a couple friends over.

560
00:31:26,184 --> 00:31:29,786
- So... what do you want, Jenny?

561
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:34,291
- What do I want?

562
00:31:36,427 --> 00:31:39,229
Don't you know?

563
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:41,431
- Ribs.

564
00:31:41,433 --> 00:31:42,532
- What?
- Yeah.

565
00:31:42,534 --> 00:31:43,700
I know how much you love ribs.

566
00:31:43,702 --> 00:31:45,836
I was thinking maybe,
you know, Chinese

567
00:31:45,838 --> 00:31:49,306
but if you want ribs,
I'm happy with that.

568
00:31:50,608 --> 00:31:53,443
- Yeah, yeah, ribs.
Let's do ribs then.

569
00:31:53,445 --> 00:31:55,279
- Okay.
- Okay.

570
00:31:55,847 --> 00:31:57,047
- Come on.

571
00:31:58,616 --> 00:32:00,736
<i>- She's always been here</i>
<i>for Thanksgiving.</i>

572
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:04,755
- Not this year.

573
00:32:08,493 --> 00:32:10,560
- I don't get what you mean
when you say...

574
00:32:10,562 --> 00:32:12,562
she looks happy.

575
00:32:13,998 --> 00:32:15,933
- I mean, she looks happy.

576
00:32:15,935 --> 00:32:19,736
What else does happy mean,
it means happy.

577
00:32:19,738 --> 00:32:22,739
- How can she be happy
with everything that's going on?

578
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:31,548
- This is bad, Rose.

579
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:32,783
- What's bad?

580
00:32:32,785 --> 00:32:34,985
- Wanting her to be unhappy.

581
00:32:37,055 --> 00:32:38,889
- I don't want
her to be unhappy.

582
00:32:38,891 --> 00:32:41,325
Why would I want that?

583
00:32:41,327 --> 00:32:43,427
- Because we are.

584
00:32:57,175 --> 00:32:58,675
<i>- I couldn't believe</i>
<i>that they're screaming.</i>

585
00:32:58,677 --> 00:33:01,044
"My baby, my baby,"
I climb all the way up

586
00:33:01,046 --> 00:33:03,814
to the top of the stairs,
and all I find is a dead cat.

587
00:33:03,816 --> 00:33:05,515
- Jesus.
- Who was that?

588
00:33:05,517 --> 00:33:08,285
- The two bull dykes
on the top floor.

589
00:33:08,287 --> 00:33:10,821
- Don't call them that.
- What?

590
00:33:10,823 --> 00:33:12,889
- Bull dykes,
don't call them bull dykes.

591
00:33:12,891 --> 00:33:14,458
- Why not?
- Because they're people.

592
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:16,460
That's why.
People like you and me.

593
00:33:16,462 --> 00:33:17,661
- Oh, I'm sorry,
I should have said

594
00:33:17,663 --> 00:33:20,263
the two bull people
on the top floor.

595
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:26,603
<i>- What's eating him?</i>
- Bobby, just let it go.

596
00:33:26,605 --> 00:33:30,173
Eddie. Eddie, listen.

597
00:33:31,542 --> 00:33:34,511
Ellen told me what Jenny wanted
to talk to you guys about.

598
00:33:34,513 --> 00:33:37,381
I'm sorry.
- How does Ellen know?

599
00:33:38,783 --> 00:33:41,018
- Stuff gets around,
but, you know, I'll be there

600
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:43,720
if you ever want to punch
this asshole's lights out.

601
00:33:43,722 --> 00:33:45,555
- Punch Kitty?

602
00:33:45,557 --> 00:33:47,791
- The married guy's name
is Kitty?

603
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:52,662
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Ted... Ted Kitty.

604
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:04,608
- Mrs. Farrell?
- Oh, my God!

605
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:07,210
Barbara Ellen, you scared me!
- I'm so sorry.

606
00:34:07,212 --> 00:34:09,513
Do you remember me?
- Of course, I remember you.

607
00:34:09,515 --> 00:34:11,181
You went to school with Jenny.

608
00:34:11,183 --> 00:34:14,451
And you didn't scare me, I was
just staring at this dress.

609
00:34:14,453 --> 00:34:17,754
- It's beautiful, isn't it?
It's not right on me.

610
00:34:17,756 --> 00:34:19,456
- You're getting married?
- Yeah.

611
00:34:19,458 --> 00:34:21,925
I'm meeting my mother inside.
How's Jenny?

612
00:34:21,927 --> 00:34:24,428
- Jenny is just great.

613
00:34:24,430 --> 00:34:26,196
- I haven't seen her
since high school.

614
00:34:26,198 --> 00:34:29,299
Is she married?
- No. No, she isn't.

615
00:34:29,301 --> 00:34:33,470
No, she's just, ugh,
completely caught up...

616
00:34:33,472 --> 00:34:37,074
in her career, she's, um,
she's a social worker.

617
00:34:37,076 --> 00:34:39,376
She handles
very disturbed children.

618
00:34:39,378 --> 00:34:42,412
Complicated cases, the ones
no one else can touch.

619
00:34:42,414 --> 00:34:44,147
She's wonderful at it.

620
00:34:44,149 --> 00:34:46,116
- I guess some women
are just like that.

621
00:34:46,118 --> 00:34:47,451
- Like what?

622
00:34:47,453 --> 00:34:49,486
- More caught up in their work
than their emotions.

623
00:34:49,488 --> 00:34:51,321
Born career gals.

624
00:34:51,323 --> 00:34:53,957
- I... I don't, I don't know
what makes you think that...

625
00:34:53,959 --> 00:34:56,526
career gals
don't have emotions.

626
00:34:56,528 --> 00:34:58,562
Jenny is picky,
uh, even about food.

627
00:34:58,564 --> 00:35:01,631
But she has strong emotions
and not throwing herself

628
00:35:01,633 --> 00:35:03,567
at the first person that comes
along is a sign of character.

629
00:35:03,569 --> 00:35:05,635
Not a lack of emotion.
- I'm sure.

630
00:35:05,637 --> 00:35:09,372
- The... the truth is, Jenny
is... is... is very involved

631
00:35:09,374 --> 00:35:11,341
with a highly respected man
in her field

632
00:35:11,343 --> 00:35:13,544
and, uh, I wouldn't be surprised
if it led to a wedding.

633
00:35:13,545 --> 00:35:15,112
So you don't need
to worry about Jenny.

634
00:35:15,114 --> 00:35:17,647
- I wasn't.
- No, no, of course not.

635
00:35:17,649 --> 00:35:19,749
Why would you be?

636
00:35:19,751 --> 00:35:21,451
- You know, my mother's waiting
for me inside.

637
00:35:21,453 --> 00:35:22,853
Mrs. Farrell, so I better go.

638
00:35:22,855 --> 00:35:25,722
- It was very nice to see you,
Barbara Ellen. All the best.

639
00:35:25,724 --> 00:35:27,724
- Thank you, Mrs. Farrell.

640
00:35:38,836 --> 00:35:41,538
- You're late.
- I know.

641
00:35:42,773 --> 00:35:45,408
- You take 90?
- Yeah.

642
00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:47,844
- What time?
- 4:30.

643
00:35:49,046 --> 00:35:51,915
- You never take 90 after 4:00,
you know that.

644
00:35:51,917 --> 00:35:53,950
Always take Carnegie.

645
00:35:53,952 --> 00:35:56,219
- It's longer.
- Less traffic.

646
00:35:56,221 --> 00:35:58,889
I always take
Carnegie after 4:00.

647
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:06,930
- It's my fault, isn't it?

648
00:36:06,932 --> 00:36:09,099
- You're the one who took 90.

649
00:36:10,601 --> 00:36:12,736
- I mean Jenny. It's my fault.

650
00:36:14,205 --> 00:36:16,406
I know they say,
it's how you're born now

651
00:36:16,408 --> 00:36:20,810
but... I don't know, I wonder.

652
00:36:20,812 --> 00:36:23,446
And I was her role model.
I'm what she's rejecting.

653
00:36:23,448 --> 00:36:25,916
- Now, don't hog
all the glory, Rose.

654
00:36:25,918 --> 00:36:28,018
I'm the man she grew up around.

655
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:30,320
If she's rejecting anybody,
it's me.

656
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:38,628
- I know you.
- Excuse me?

657
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:42,699
- I know you,
and I know what you're thinking.

658
00:36:42,701 --> 00:36:44,334
- What's that?

659
00:36:44,336 --> 00:36:46,136
- You're blaming me.

660
00:36:46,138 --> 00:36:48,972
- What for?
- The lying!

661
00:36:48,974 --> 00:36:50,373
- I'm not blaming you
for lying.

662
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:53,877
I'm... I'm just doing
what you wanna do.

663
00:36:53,879 --> 00:36:56,580
- Why do you keep saying that?
- Because it's true.

664
00:36:56,582 --> 00:36:58,114
- Then, ugh.

665
00:36:58,116 --> 00:36:59,649
Then let's do
what you want to do, Eddie.

666
00:36:59,651 --> 00:37:01,318
You never say what you wanna do.
What do you want to do, Eddie?

667
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,620
- I want... I want to eat
my dinner in peace and quiet.

668
00:37:03,622 --> 00:37:06,523
That's what I want to do.
- No, it isn't!

669
00:37:06,525 --> 00:37:08,858
You... you... you want me
to be the bad guy

670
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:11,428
that's what you want.
It's always been that way.

671
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:13,830
I look like the bad guy
when all I'm doing is exactly

672
00:37:13,832 --> 00:37:16,933
what you want to do, but I end
up getting blamed for it!

673
00:37:33,017 --> 00:37:35,819
- I kind of like that
it's not white.

674
00:37:35,821 --> 00:37:37,887
- Looks like a cantaloupe.

675
00:37:39,357 --> 00:37:42,092
What about that?

676
00:37:42,094 --> 00:37:46,196
- Oh, my gosh, that dress
would be perfect on you.

677
00:37:52,303 --> 00:37:56,339
- Jenny!
- I love that. I love it.

678
00:37:56,341 --> 00:37:59,209
- All these dresses
are so beautiful.

679
00:37:59,211 --> 00:38:01,344
- Well, you gotta pick
the one you love the best

680
00:38:01,346 --> 00:38:03,266
because you
only get married once.

681
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:10,954
Oh, my gosh, I love this one.
- Hmm.

682
00:38:10,956 --> 00:38:14,057
- This is the dress for me.
I love this.

683
00:38:14,059 --> 00:38:16,760
- I never thought
we'd be doing this.

684
00:38:16,762 --> 00:38:18,595
- Did you?
- No.

685
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:41,818
<i>- I may have grown up</i>
<i>in a trailer park, Bryce</i>

686
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:43,486

00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:53,496
- Are you busy?

692
00:38:53,498 --> 00:38:56,333
- No, just ironing.

693
00:38:56,335 --> 00:38:58,268
Camilla told Bryce...

694
00:38:58,270 --> 00:38:59,569
if she doesn't get
Worthington Manor

695
00:38:59,571 --> 00:39:02,372
in the divorce settlement,
she'll expose his past.

696
00:39:02,374 --> 00:39:04,307
- I saw Jenny this morning.

697
00:39:04,309 --> 00:39:08,078
<i>- Oh, yeah. Where?</i>
- Nordstrom.

698
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,813
<i>- Oh, was there a sale?</i>

699
00:39:09,815 --> 00:39:13,616
- No. Something happened.

700
00:39:13,618 --> 00:39:16,519
I don't know
if I should tell you

701
00:39:16,521 --> 00:39:21,024
but... I figured somebody else
will sooner or later

702
00:39:21,026 --> 00:39:23,259
so it's better
if it comes from me.

703
00:39:25,429 --> 00:39:29,132
She was outside
the bridal suite with Kitty.

704
00:39:29,134 --> 00:39:31,634
They're a couple, Mom.

705
00:39:31,636 --> 00:39:34,371
They were kissing
each other in public.

706
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:42,112
I should have
gone up to them, but I...

707
00:39:42,114 --> 00:39:43,980
was so blown away, I couldn't
and then I didn't know

708
00:39:43,982 --> 00:39:47,484
what to do. If I should, if I
should tell you or not tell you.

709
00:39:47,486 --> 00:39:50,653
And then I thought, well, you should
know before anybody else does.

710
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:55,458
How could we have
missed it all these years?

711
00:39:55,460 --> 00:40:00,497
No boyfriends, hanging out with
all those girls all the time.

712
00:40:00,499 --> 00:40:03,767
And it looked like they were
picking out wedding dresses, Mom.

713
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:07,670
Wedding dresses!

714
00:40:07,672 --> 00:40:09,706
- They probably were.

715
00:40:10,708 --> 00:40:13,076
They're getting married.

716
00:40:13,078 --> 00:40:14,477
- What?

717
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:20,250
<i>- They're getting married.</i>

718
00:40:20,252 --> 00:40:22,752
- You knew about them?
- Yeah.

719
00:40:22,754 --> 00:40:24,487
- Since when?

720
00:40:24,489 --> 00:40:25,855
- Since...

721
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:28,958
our anniversary party.

722
00:40:30,861 --> 00:40:34,330
- So all that stuff about the
married man was a pack of lies?

723
00:40:34,332 --> 00:40:35,565
- It...

724
00:40:37,802 --> 00:40:39,769
It wasn't the truth.

725
00:40:41,238 --> 00:40:43,540
- You two
and your conspiracies.

726
00:40:43,542 --> 00:40:44,941
- Conspiracies?

727
00:40:44,943 --> 00:40:47,610
- When we were growing up,
you and little miss perfect

728
00:40:47,612 --> 00:40:49,913
belonged to a club
I couldn't join.

729
00:40:49,915 --> 00:40:52,348
It didn't bother Michael,
he was the boy.

730
00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:54,951
But I was the outsider
and I<i> still am.</i>

731
00:40:54,953 --> 00:40:57,854
- You were never the outsider
even when you wanted to be.

732
00:40:57,856 --> 00:41:00,089
- Wanted to be!
- You were always testing us.

733
00:41:00,091 --> 00:41:02,425
Breaking the rules to see
what would happen.

734
00:41:02,427 --> 00:41:06,362
Jenny was easy. -You have never
loved me as much as you love Jenny!

735
00:41:06,364 --> 00:41:08,498
- That is not true!

736
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:11,835
Oh, I love all my children the same.
- No, you don't!

737
00:41:11,837 --> 00:41:15,438
God, if you did you wouldn't
have lied to me.

738
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,574
You made a fool out me!

739
00:41:17,576 --> 00:41:20,443
Letting me go on and on about
all that married man bullshit

740
00:41:20,445 --> 00:41:22,846
just to keep your secrets!

741
00:41:22,848 --> 00:41:25,415
As usual,
the two of you against me.

742
00:41:25,417 --> 00:41:26,716
What kind of love is that!

743
00:41:47,238 --> 00:41:48,872
- Mom.

744
00:41:48,874 --> 00:41:50,540
Whatever you've got to tell me
you gotta tell me fast.

745
00:41:50,542 --> 00:41:52,876
I've got to be in court in an
hour, and you wouldn't believe it

746
00:41:52,878 --> 00:41:54,811
this couple left their
5-year-old son

747
00:41:54,813 --> 00:41:57,380
locked in their apartment
while they went on vacation.

748
00:41:57,382 --> 00:41:59,682
And now of course they want...
- Anne knows.

749
00:41:59,684 --> 00:42:01,317
- Knows what?
- About you and Kitty.

750
00:42:01,319 --> 00:42:03,620
She saw you this morning
at Nordstrom.

751
00:42:03,622 --> 00:42:07,924
She's... she's very angry
about being lied to.

752
00:42:10,728 --> 00:42:13,429
I know I got it wrong, I know.

753
00:42:13,431 --> 00:42:17,333
But ever since
you were a little girl...

754
00:42:17,335 --> 00:42:19,536
I've thought about
your wedding.

755
00:42:19,538 --> 00:42:23,573
I imagined helping you pick out
your silver and flatware

756
00:42:23,575 --> 00:42:26,442
your china and helping
you pick out your dress.

757
00:42:26,444 --> 00:42:28,611
Now, I don't even know
if you'll wear a dress.

758
00:42:28,613 --> 00:42:32,715
Maybe you'll wear a suit or, or maybe you'll
wear a dress and Kitty will wear a suit...

759
00:42:32,717 --> 00:42:34,117
- We're both wearing dresses.

760
00:42:34,119 --> 00:42:35,652
- And where will you
get married?

761
00:42:35,654 --> 00:42:37,487
Not in the church,
the church won't allow it.

762
00:42:37,489 --> 00:42:40,123
- But that doesn't mean
God won't allow it.

763
00:42:40,125 --> 00:42:42,525
- The thing is...

764
00:42:42,527 --> 00:42:46,863
I'm not good
at making things up.

765
00:42:46,865 --> 00:42:49,532
When I cook I use a cookbook.

766
00:42:49,534 --> 00:42:52,068
And the way you dance, I don't...
I don't like dancing, like that.

767
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:56,039
I... I like steps. I like,
I like dances with steps.

768
00:42:56,041 --> 00:42:57,941
Like, that one,
you know that one...

769
00:42:57,943 --> 00:43:00,043
- The conga line?
- Yeah.

770
00:43:00,045 --> 00:43:02,045
- It doesn't have steps.

771
00:43:02,047 --> 00:43:05,782
- Well, but I always
do the same ones.

772
00:43:05,784 --> 00:43:08,051
I love the conga line.

773
00:43:08,053 --> 00:43:09,919
I know the steps to that one

774
00:43:09,921 --> 00:43:12,388
but I don't know
the steps to this one.

775
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:16,192
- And you think I do? Really?

776
00:43:16,194 --> 00:43:18,928
I don't like making it up as I
go along <i> any more</i> than you do.

777
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:21,497
But I<i> don't</i> have<i> a choice.</i>

778
00:43:21,499 --> 00:43:25,068
Oh, Mom, you can pretend all you
want, that nothing has changed.

779
00:43:25,070 --> 00:43:27,003
But I have.

780
00:43:27,005 --> 00:43:31,941
And I'm not lying about who I am
to anybody, ever again.

781
00:43:31,943 --> 00:43:34,210
Not even for you.

782
00:43:34,212 --> 00:43:36,913
Because if I do...

783
00:43:36,915 --> 00:43:40,283
I'll<i> ruin</i> what's good in me.

784
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:46,656
You... you raised me
to... to do the right thing.

785
00:43:46,658 --> 00:43:49,192
And... and be proud of myself.

786
00:43:49,194 --> 00:43:52,095
Don't you want me
to be that person anymore?

787
00:43:58,936 --> 00:44:01,537
The lying is over.

788
00:44:01,539 --> 00:44:03,740
You and Dad are going to have
to make up your mind about me

789
00:44:03,742 --> 00:44:05,942
because I am getting married...

790
00:44:05,944 --> 00:44:07,810
and I'm going to have children.

791
00:44:07,812 --> 00:44:11,114
I'm going to have
a happy and full life.

792
00:44:11,116 --> 00:44:14,017
And I'm not hiding it... anymore.

793
00:44:14,019 --> 00:44:18,721
So if you can't handle that it'll have to
be your problem from now on. Not mine.

794
00:45:01,266 --> 00:45:03,466
- You knew?
- Well, I...

795
00:45:03,468 --> 00:45:07,103
I mean, not for sure,
but yeah, I knew.

796
00:45:07,105 --> 00:45:08,805
- Since when?

797
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:12,375
- High school.

798
00:45:14,311 --> 00:45:18,181
- Well, then why were you always trying
to set me up with your friends?

799
00:45:18,183 --> 00:45:20,183
- Mom and Dad asked me to.

800
00:45:23,754 --> 00:45:25,354
- Well in case you're wondering

801
00:45:25,356 --> 00:45:28,091
they are not coming
to the wedding.

802
00:45:29,426 --> 00:45:32,195
And you don't have to either
if you don't want to.

803
00:45:32,197 --> 00:45:34,530
- Why wouldn't I want
to come to your wedding?

804
00:45:34,532 --> 00:45:36,466
- Because it doesn't
stop there.

805
00:45:36,468 --> 00:45:39,168
- We want a family,
and I'm sure you do not approve.

806
00:45:39,170 --> 00:45:42,004
- God, Jenny.

807
00:45:42,006 --> 00:45:43,906
Sometimes you are really dim.

808
00:45:43,908 --> 00:45:45,708
I mean, has it ever
occurred to you

809
00:45:45,710 --> 00:45:49,746
that if you spend your life, lying
to people about who you are...

810
00:45:49,748 --> 00:45:52,515
you never get to know
who they are.

811
00:45:52,517 --> 00:45:55,084
Look, I don't disapprove. Okay?

812
00:45:55,086 --> 00:45:57,720
I'm coming to your wedding.
You're my sister.

813
00:46:02,993 --> 00:46:06,129
- You know, I just, I really
was dreading telling you.

814
00:46:06,131 --> 00:46:09,699
- Why? -Because you're... you're
the most like Mom and Dad.

815
00:46:09,701 --> 00:46:12,101
- No, I'm not, Jenny.

816
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:16,072
You are.

817
00:47:05,289 --> 00:47:06,622
- So?

818
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:11,661
- I'm sorry.
- For what, being the favorite?

819
00:47:11,663 --> 00:47:13,095
- What?

820
00:47:13,097 --> 00:47:15,364
- Do you think you'd be getting
away with this if you weren't?

821
00:47:15,366 --> 00:47:18,034
- First of all,
this isn't a stunt, Anne.

822
00:47:18,036 --> 00:47:19,836
This is my life.

823
00:47:19,838 --> 00:47:23,005
Secondly, I'm not getting away
with anything.

824
00:47:23,007 --> 00:47:24,340
I am nobody's favorite,
not anymore.

825
00:47:24,342 --> 00:47:26,776
So you need to just,
get over it.

826
00:47:29,079 --> 00:47:31,514
- Feeling unloved is not
something you just get over.

827
00:47:31,516 --> 00:47:34,584
- Yes. It is.
You<i> just</i> have to grow up.

828
00:47:34,586 --> 00:47:37,019
- Why did you come here, Jenny,
to pick a fight?

829
00:47:37,021 --> 00:47:38,454
- No.

830
00:47:39,857 --> 00:47:41,157
No, I...

831
00:47:41,159 --> 00:47:44,694
I wanted to say
I was sorry for not telling you.

832
00:47:44,696 --> 00:47:47,730
I wanted to, but Mom,
couldn't handle it.

833
00:47:47,732 --> 00:47:50,433
We're sisters! Why didn't
you tell me years ago?

834
00:47:50,435 --> 00:47:53,369
- Come on, Anne. We never really
shared our secrets with one another.

835
00:47:53,371 --> 00:47:54,737
And for good reason.

836
00:47:54,739 --> 00:47:57,039
Instead of just coming to me
when you saw me with Kitty

837
00:47:57,041 --> 00:47:58,975
you ran straight to Mom.

838
00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:02,144
- Fair enough.

839
00:48:04,648 --> 00:48:06,616
- Can I come in?
- No.

840
00:48:08,252 --> 00:48:10,953
You'll over excite the kids,
and Frankie's asleep.

841
00:48:15,592 --> 00:48:17,593
But have a seat.

842
00:48:26,103 --> 00:48:27,270
- So there's something
I want to ask you...

843
00:48:27,272 --> 00:48:29,152
- My wedding gown
won't fit you.

844
00:48:30,841 --> 00:48:32,708
- I don't want
to wear your wedding gown.

845
00:48:32,710 --> 00:48:37,680
Um, I wanted to know if you
would be my maid of honor.

846
00:48:38,949 --> 00:48:40,616
If you don't want to, it's okay

847
00:48:40,618 --> 00:48:43,185
but, it would mean a lot to me
if you would.

848
00:48:46,657 --> 00:48:48,724
- You want me to be
your maid of honor?

849
00:48:48,726 --> 00:48:50,226
- Well, yeah.

850
00:48:50,228 --> 00:48:52,828
I was yours,
and you're my sister.

851
00:48:52,830 --> 00:48:54,163
- I know, but...

852
00:48:57,067 --> 00:48:58,367
I don't know.

853
00:48:58,369 --> 00:49:00,469
I always felt like...

854
00:49:02,339 --> 00:49:05,174
you acted like
I wasn't in your league.

855
00:49:06,209 --> 00:49:09,045
- Anne... it was never that.

856
00:49:09,047 --> 00:49:10,346
Okay, it was never that.

857
00:49:10,348 --> 00:49:13,849
I just... I was in hiding.

858
00:49:13,851 --> 00:49:16,953
And I just really couldn't
afford to get close to you.

859
00:49:17,688 --> 00:49:19,055
<i>- Dad!</i>

860
00:49:20,724 --> 00:49:24,427
- I, uh, I can't
talk about this... right now.

861
00:49:24,429 --> 00:49:26,629
I have to go.

862
00:49:26,631 --> 00:49:28,497
- Okay.

863
00:49:28,499 --> 00:49:30,599
- I'll call you later, okay?
- Mm-hmm.

864
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:34,770
- How long have you been
with Kitty?

865
00:49:34,772 --> 00:49:36,105
-5 years.

866
00:49:37,741 --> 00:49:40,376
- When I saw you kissing,
you looked really...

867
00:49:42,012 --> 00:49:43,512
really happy.

868
00:49:49,553 --> 00:49:51,554
That grass is completely dead.

869
00:49:53,690 --> 00:49:55,224
- It's winter.

870
00:49:56,727 --> 00:49:59,362
- Yeah, I know, but...

871
00:49:59,364 --> 00:50:02,164
It's always dead.
Even in the spring.

872
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:08,571
<i>- Dad! Dad!</i>

873
00:50:08,573 --> 00:50:10,573
- I gotta go.

874
00:50:11,775 --> 00:50:13,542
Frankie!

875
00:50:15,145 --> 00:50:16,312
What are you doing?

876
00:50:16,314 --> 00:50:18,147
- I don't have any cash.

877
00:50:18,149 --> 00:50:20,816
- Get it out of the bank
like I do. I'm not an ATM.

878
00:50:20,818 --> 00:50:22,752
Why are you all dressed up?
Where are you going?

879
00:50:22,754 --> 00:50:24,954
- Um, didn't I tell you?
Pete called.

880
00:50:24,956 --> 00:50:26,856
He wants to talk to me
about something.

881
00:50:26,858 --> 00:50:28,591
Business probably.

882
00:50:28,593 --> 00:50:29,859
- Business?

883
00:50:29,861 --> 00:50:32,928
You and Pete
are unarmed security guards.

884
00:50:34,364 --> 00:50:36,365
- Don't wait up. You know Pete.

885
00:50:38,435 --> 00:50:40,636
- Why don't you ever
water the grass?

886
00:50:41,838 --> 00:50:43,606
- Why would I water the grass
in the winter?

887
00:50:43,608 --> 00:50:47,510
- Because you never water it even in
the summer and it's always dead.

888
00:50:47,512 --> 00:50:49,412
- Okay, if it bothers you
so much, why don't you water it?

889
00:50:49,414 --> 00:50:52,948
- Because it's not my job! I do
everything else around here!

890
00:50:52,950 --> 00:50:55,885
You could at least do that!

891
00:50:55,887 --> 00:50:58,621
- I gotta go.

892
00:51:10,801 --> 00:51:12,868
- I don't understand
why she hasn't called.

893
00:51:12,870 --> 00:51:15,938
I've left 6 messages,
you've left 4.

894
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:17,740
- 5.
- 5.

895
00:51:19,443 --> 00:51:22,545
- Ah, just things went
a little too far, that's all.

896
00:51:22,547 --> 00:51:24,880
She'll call when she calms down.

897
00:51:24,882 --> 00:51:28,117
- You weren't there, Eddie.
I've never seen her like that.

898
00:51:28,119 --> 00:51:31,921
- No, no. She'll calm down.
What's she gonna do?

899
00:51:31,923 --> 00:51:34,256
Never call us again? Hmm?

900
00:51:44,868 --> 00:51:47,603
- I don't, I don't want
to go in there.

901
00:51:53,210 --> 00:51:55,344
- I want you here.

902
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:09,625
- Hi, everybody.

903
00:52:12,929 --> 00:52:16,198
- Kitty. -Hi. Mrs. Farrell,
Mr. Farrell.

904
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:17,633
<i>- Jen.</i>

905
00:52:17,635 --> 00:52:20,402
- When you didn't call back,
I didn't think you were coming.

906
00:52:20,404 --> 00:52:22,138
- Of course I was coming.

907
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:24,140
Mrs. McMahan was my favorite
neighbor.

908
00:52:26,510 --> 00:52:28,711
Kitty, you remember
Mr. and Mrs. O'Leary.

909
00:52:28,713 --> 00:52:30,713
- Oh, yes.
Yes, nice to see you again.

910
00:52:30,715 --> 00:52:33,048
- Nice to see you, Kitty.

911
00:52:33,050 --> 00:52:35,417
Kitty is Jenny's roommate.
- Oh, right.

912
00:52:35,419 --> 00:52:37,186
- Kitty isn't my roommate,
Mrs. O'Leary.

913
00:52:37,188 --> 00:52:40,422
She is my partner,
and we've been together 5 years.

914
00:52:40,424 --> 00:52:42,758
<i>We're getting married.</i>

915
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:44,561
We're a little bit old fashioned
so we figured

916
00:52:44,562 --> 00:52:46,795
we'd tie the knot before
starting a family.

917
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:51,367
- Um, can I talk to you
a minute?

918
00:52:51,369 --> 00:52:53,610
- I was just gonna go in...
- I want to talk first.

919
00:52:58,742 --> 00:53:00,576
- What are you doing? Are you
trying to hurt your mother?

920
00:53:00,578 --> 00:53:01,744
- How am I hurting her?

921
00:53:01,746 --> 00:53:04,113
- By making a scene
at a funeral.

922
00:53:04,115 --> 00:53:06,148
Stutzman's is a place for grief.

923
00:53:06,150 --> 00:53:09,351
If you want to humiliate your mother,
go try and do it someplace else.

924
00:53:09,353 --> 00:53:12,755
- I'm sorry if telling people who I
am and how I live is humiliating.

925
00:53:12,757 --> 00:53:16,792
But I am not gonna pretend to be somebody
else anymore just to make you feel okay.

926
00:53:16,794 --> 00:53:20,296
- Why is it always about you?
It's about her too.

927
00:53:20,298 --> 00:53:24,033
We called you over and over
again, why didn't you reply?

928
00:53:24,035 --> 00:53:27,002
How do you think she felt when you walked
away from her in the arcade the other day?

929
00:53:27,004 --> 00:53:28,537
- Why is it always about her?

930
00:53:28,539 --> 00:53:30,639
Isn't there a<i> you</i> in this?

931
00:53:30,641 --> 00:53:32,942
Why don't you stop
hiding behind Mom

932
00:53:32,944 --> 00:53:34,977
and tell me how it's about you?

933
00:53:34,979 --> 00:53:37,746
- Well, I will, I will
tell you about how I feel.

934
00:53:37,748 --> 00:53:41,150
It's not how I live.
I don't understand any of it.

935
00:53:41,152 --> 00:53:42,651
And I don't understand you.

936
00:53:42,653 --> 00:53:45,654
You're, you're getting married,
but I..

937
00:53:45,656 --> 00:53:47,456
I don't know who's who.

938
00:53:47,458 --> 00:53:48,691
- Who's who?
- Yeah, yeah.

939
00:53:48,693 --> 00:53:50,326
You're both feminine girls.

940
00:53:50,328 --> 00:53:52,394
And I don't know.

941
00:53:52,396 --> 00:53:54,330
I don't know who's,
I don't know what you do.

942
00:53:54,332 --> 00:53:56,899
- What we do?
- And I don't want to.

943
00:53:56,901 --> 00:54:00,135
I just, I mean,
you're my daughter and..

944
00:54:00,137 --> 00:54:01,870
I just don't want
to think about it.

945
00:54:01,872 --> 00:54:04,440
I mean, I spend enough time at
that firehouse. Men are animals.

946
00:54:04,442 --> 00:54:07,509
It's what they think about when
they look at porno movies.

947
00:54:07,511 --> 00:54:11,380
But if, if you were marrying a guy, I wouldn't
think about it. I'd know what you do.

948
00:54:11,382 --> 00:54:13,916
- When I was a kid, I used to hate
to think about you and Mom in bed.

949
00:54:13,918 --> 00:54:16,752
It gave me the creeps,
so I think I know how you feel.

950
00:54:16,754 --> 00:54:18,654
Let me put your mind at rest.

951
00:54:18,656 --> 00:54:20,823
Hey, Kitty.

952
00:54:20,825 --> 00:54:23,759
My dad wants to know if one of
us straps it on in bed.

953
00:54:29,966 --> 00:54:31,834
Oh, I'm sorry, Dad.
She's a little bit funny.

954
00:54:31,836 --> 00:54:35,671
She doesn't like to tell people
what she does or doesn't do in bed!

955
00:54:35,673 --> 00:54:38,407
- I don't know
who you are anymore.

956
00:54:38,409 --> 00:54:40,709
And I don't know if I care.

957
00:54:41,578 --> 00:54:42,845
What's happened to you?

958
00:54:42,847 --> 00:54:45,581
- I'll tell you
what's happened. I grew up.

959
00:54:45,583 --> 00:54:47,650
I used to care so much about
what the two of you thought

960
00:54:47,652 --> 00:54:49,785
but not anymore. Why would I!

961
00:54:49,787 --> 00:54:52,454
How<i> dare you</i> talk to me
about meeting the right person.

962
00:54:52,456 --> 00:54:55,524
Do you know who you meet every
time you or Mom change?

963
00:54:55,526 --> 00:54:58,661
The same couple
of lying cowards.

964
00:54:58,663 --> 00:55:01,964
From now on, I only care about
what I think and what I do.

965
00:55:01,966 --> 00:55:04,300
And if you don't like it,
then you can get out of my life.

966
00:55:04,302 --> 00:55:07,369
Believe me, I will not miss you,
it will be a relief.

967
00:55:07,371 --> 00:55:09,405
If all you can do
is tolerate me

968
00:55:09,407 --> 00:55:11,507
I will be happier
when you're gone.

969
00:55:36,966 --> 00:55:41,003
- Well, uh, it was
nice... seeing you all again.

970
00:55:43,741 --> 00:55:45,974
I have to go.

971
00:56:03,059 --> 00:56:05,127
Your mother will come around.

972
00:56:05,129 --> 00:56:06,895
- No, she won't.

973
00:56:06,897 --> 00:56:09,365
They never do or say anything
without the other

974
00:56:09,367 --> 00:56:12,234
and now he'll<i> never</i> come around.

975
00:56:12,236 --> 00:56:14,069
- Give him time.

976
00:56:14,071 --> 00:56:16,905
- You don't know him.

977
00:56:16,907 --> 00:56:21,310
He lets a lot of stuff go
but... I called him out tonight.

978
00:56:21,312 --> 00:56:25,681
I...I made him look like a fool
in public and now he'll never

979
00:56:25,683 --> 00:56:30,085
get over that, and he hardly
ever shuts the door

980
00:56:30,087 --> 00:56:32,254
but when he does it,
it stays shut.

981
00:56:33,656 --> 00:56:35,023
Not that I care.

982
00:56:35,025 --> 00:56:37,993
Because I'm not apologizing
to anybody for anything.

983
00:56:41,698 --> 00:56:43,866
- We have to talk
about this, Eddie.

984
00:56:45,602 --> 00:56:49,905
- I already told you.
I got nothing to say.

985
00:56:49,907 --> 00:56:52,007
- I'm not trying to defend her.
She said ter...

986
00:56:52,009 --> 00:56:54,309
- Rose. Are you deaf?

987
00:56:54,311 --> 00:56:57,179
I just told you, I've got
nothing to say. I mean it.

988
00:56:57,181 --> 00:57:00,215
So don't bring it up
with me again. Ever.

989
00:57:08,359 --> 00:57:09,825
<i>- Rose.</i>

990
00:57:09,827 --> 00:57:11,960
Rose.

991
00:57:11,962 --> 00:57:14,229
<i>Rose.</i>

992
00:57:14,231 --> 00:57:17,065
- Hi, Ellen. Hi.

993
00:57:17,067 --> 00:57:19,001
- I've been so worried.

994
00:57:19,003 --> 00:57:21,970
I left messages all week,
but you never called back.

995
00:57:21,972 --> 00:57:23,739
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

996
00:57:23,741 --> 00:57:29,278
- Oh, how can you be fine after that
disgraceful incident at Stutzman's?

997
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:33,715
The things she said
<i>were... unforgivable.</i>

998
00:57:33,717 --> 00:57:35,884
I just hope you're not blaming
yourselves for any of this

999
00:57:35,886 --> 00:57:38,454
because you've both
been great parents.

1000
00:57:39,989 --> 00:57:42,524
Did you know about them before?

1001
00:57:42,526 --> 00:57:44,726
- We knew before.

1002
00:57:44,728 --> 00:57:47,996
- I'd have lied about
the married man too.

1003
00:57:47,998 --> 00:57:51,099
Well, you're doing
the right thing.

1004
00:57:53,136 --> 00:57:54,436
- What am I doing?

1005
00:57:54,438 --> 00:57:56,805
- Turning your back
on all of it.

1006
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:02,077
- I can't talk now, Ellen,
I have to go.

1007
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:04,780
- Christmas will be hard,
but just remember

1008
00:58:04,782 --> 00:58:06,148
you're doing the right thing.

1009
00:58:06,150 --> 00:58:09,751
And any time you want to talk,
I'm right here.

1010
00:58:23,833 --> 00:58:26,101
- Hey, Eddie. How you doing?

1011
00:58:26,103 --> 00:58:28,103
- Yeah. I'm fine.

1012
00:58:35,612 --> 00:58:37,946
Um...

1013
00:58:37,948 --> 00:58:41,884
Did you tell the guys what happened
at Stutzman's the other day?

1014
00:58:41,886 --> 00:58:44,987
- No. Come on, Eddie.

1015
00:58:44,989 --> 00:58:47,956
I'd never talk about your private
business with anybody. You know that.

1016
00:58:47,958 --> 00:58:51,627
They don't,
they don't know anything.

1017
00:58:51,629 --> 00:58:52,794
Listen, Eddie,
I gotta tell you.

1018
00:58:52,796 --> 00:58:55,430
I... I think
this whole thing stinks.

1019
00:58:55,432 --> 00:58:57,566
As good as you
and Rose have been

1020
00:58:57,568 --> 00:59:00,235
this is the way Jenny
turns around and pays you back?

1021
00:59:02,405 --> 00:59:04,673
- Yeah. I don't wanna
talk about it.

1022
00:59:04,675 --> 00:59:06,642
- No. Okay.

1023
00:59:10,179 --> 00:59:13,148
You know, it's funny.
Her name is Kitty.

1024
00:59:15,151 --> 00:59:18,587
- What?
- The girl's name is Kitty.

1025
00:59:18,589 --> 00:59:22,758
I mean, first Jenny was with a
married man, and his name was Kitty.

1026
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:25,227
Now, her name is Kitty.

1027
00:59:45,249 --> 00:59:48,350
- Hello.
- Hi, honey.

1028
00:59:48,352 --> 00:59:51,253
- Ugh. Hi, Mom. What's up?

1029
00:59:52,522 --> 00:59:56,224
- Uh, nothing, I just
called to see how you are.

1030
00:59:56,226 --> 01:00:00,295
<i>- Fine, and you?</i>
- I'm fine. How are the kids?

1031
01:00:00,297 --> 01:00:04,766
- Fine.
- And uh, Frankie?

1032
01:00:04,768 --> 01:00:06,768
- Frankie's fine.

1033
01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:08,570
Mom, did you call for a reason

1034
01:00:08,572 --> 01:00:12,507
'cause I'm standing in
the driveway, and it's raining.

1035
01:00:12,509 --> 01:00:15,711
And I have a pile of groceries
and a sleeping baby.

1036
01:00:15,713 --> 01:00:18,880
- No. No reason, it's not
raining here yet though.

1037
01:00:18,882 --> 01:00:22,017
I... I... I just called
to say hello.

1038
01:00:22,019 --> 01:00:24,019
- Okay. I'll call you back
later.

1039
01:00:24,021 --> 01:00:26,622
- I love you, Anne.
- Yeah, okay, bye.

1040
01:01:06,763 --> 01:01:09,064
- Okay. What do you think?

1041
01:01:11,901 --> 01:01:13,902
- It's perfect.

1042
01:01:13,904 --> 01:01:15,804
- I've always dreamed
of wearing a dress like this.

1043
01:01:15,806 --> 01:01:17,806
- Oh, you look beautiful.

1044
01:01:23,780 --> 01:01:25,113
- Oh, wow.

1045
01:01:25,115 --> 01:01:28,016
- Well, now I don't know
who looks more beautiful.

1046
01:01:28,018 --> 01:01:29,484
Is this a double wedding?

1047
01:01:29,486 --> 01:01:31,887
- Yes.

1048
01:01:31,889 --> 01:01:33,255
- Well, then I'll leave
you two alone to think.

1049
01:01:33,257 --> 01:01:35,657
I know you'll want to come back
with your mothers.

1050
01:01:39,629 --> 01:01:41,530
- This dress isn't right.
It's not right.

1051
01:01:41,532 --> 01:01:44,833
It's too traditional.

1052
01:01:44,835 --> 01:01:46,668
- Well, what's wrong
with traditional?

1053
01:01:46,670 --> 01:01:48,670
- You want to wear the tux?

1054
01:01:52,542 --> 01:01:55,243
- My mother's
not here either, Jenny.

1055
01:01:55,245 --> 01:01:58,513
- I know.
Your mother's in Portland.

1056
01:01:58,515 --> 01:02:01,450
Mine is 20 minutes up
the road in rush hour traffic.

1057
01:02:27,477 --> 01:02:29,544
- Tell me something. -If it's about
Mom, I don't want to hear it.

1058
01:02:29,546 --> 01:02:30,812
It's not about Mom.

1059
01:02:30,814 --> 01:02:34,516
I know you live in a condo,
but if you had grass

1060
01:02:34,518 --> 01:02:36,551
would it be dead or alive?

1061
01:02:38,488 --> 01:02:40,522
- It would be alive.

1062
01:02:40,524 --> 01:02:42,824
- Just as I thought.

1063
01:02:42,826 --> 01:02:45,794
Happy people
do not have dead grass.

1064
01:02:55,037 --> 01:02:57,038
- I quit the bowling team.

1065
01:02:58,941 --> 01:03:01,777
- Why?

1066
01:03:01,779 --> 01:03:03,779
- They're talking
behind my back.

1067
01:03:06,983 --> 01:03:09,651
- Can you do that?

1068
01:03:09,653 --> 01:03:12,573
- Do what? -Quit the bowling team.
You're the treasurer.

1069
01:03:13,890 --> 01:03:15,957
- Yes. I can do that.

1070
01:03:19,095 --> 01:03:21,830
Don't you want to know what
they're saying behind my back?

1071
01:03:25,935 --> 01:03:27,402
- No.

1072
01:03:30,706 --> 01:03:33,675
- You can't
just not talk about this, Eddie.

1073
01:03:42,786 --> 01:03:44,553
- We've lost our daughter!

1074
01:04:09,579 --> 01:04:12,514
- Hello.
<i>- Hi, Anne. It's me.</i>

1075
01:04:12,516 --> 01:04:16,218
- Ugh. Hi, Mom. How are you?
<i>- I'm fine.</i>

1076
01:04:16,220 --> 01:04:19,588
Doing a little... house work.

1077
01:04:19,590 --> 01:04:21,323
How are you?

1078
01:04:21,325 --> 01:04:23,091
- Oh, I'm fine.

1079
01:04:23,093 --> 01:04:26,294
- How about Frankie
and the kids? They okay?

1080
01:04:26,296 --> 01:04:27,929
- They're-they're fine.

1081
01:04:27,931 --> 01:04:31,433
- Have you seen, uh, Michael
and Lorraine at all?

1082
01:04:31,435 --> 01:04:35,804
- Oh, for God's sake, Mom, if you want to
know how Jenny is, call her. Don't call me.

1083
01:04:35,806 --> 01:04:38,473
- I know that's
what all these calls are about.

1084
01:04:38,475 --> 01:04:41,943
Listen, there's something
I... I... I have to do.

1085
01:04:41,945 --> 01:04:44,045
I'll... I'll
call you later, okay?

1086
01:04:44,047 --> 01:04:46,948
- Okay. I love you, Anne.
- Oh, my God.

1087
01:04:46,950 --> 01:04:49,885
Will you please stop saying that, it's
turned into your personal greeting!

1088
01:04:49,887 --> 01:04:52,721
- I'm sorry.
I just wanted you to know.

1089
01:04:52,723 --> 01:04:54,356
<i>- Uh, yeah. I know, I know,</i>
<i>I know, I know.</i>

1090
01:04:54,358 --> 01:04:56,658
We all love each other,
and I have to go. Goodbye.

1091
01:07:23,706 --> 01:07:27,042
<i>- And they never</i>
<i>talk about it. Not a word.</i>

1092
01:07:27,044 --> 01:07:29,611
<i>- I wouldn't either</i>
<i>if it was my daughter.</i>

1093
01:07:29,613 --> 01:07:32,847
- They were such good parents.

1094
01:07:32,849 --> 01:07:35,784
- Well, they must have done
something wrong.

1095
01:07:35,786 --> 01:07:38,720
- We've all had problems with
our kids, but nothing like this.

1096
01:07:38,722 --> 01:07:41,356
- I really feel sorry for them.

1097
01:07:41,358 --> 01:07:43,625
And this wedding
is embarrassing enough

1098
01:07:43,627 --> 01:07:46,828
but those two are planning
on having children.

1099
01:07:46,830 --> 01:07:50,865
How can they have a normal life
growing up in that house?

1100
01:07:50,867 --> 01:07:53,001
- It isn't right.

1101
01:07:53,003 --> 01:07:56,671
- Since when did you two become such big
experts on what's normal and right?

1102
01:07:56,673 --> 01:07:58,440
- Rose.
We didn't mean anything.

1103
01:07:58,442 --> 01:07:59,874
We're just worried about you.

1104
01:07:59,876 --> 01:08:01,042
- Tell me, Marion.

1105
01:08:01,044 --> 01:08:02,977
Is it normal and right
for your, your daughter

1106
01:08:02,979 --> 01:08:05,013
to get pregnant
by every passing stranger

1107
01:08:05,015 --> 01:08:07,082
and leave you to raise the kids?

1108
01:08:07,084 --> 01:08:11,252
Or for... for... for Karen and her
bum of a husband to never get a job

1109
01:08:11,254 --> 01:08:13,488
and... and rob you and Denny

1110
01:08:13,490 --> 01:08:15,557
of every last penny
of your retirement savings!

1111
01:08:15,559 --> 01:08:19,761
That's all normal and right just
because the men sleep with women!

1112
01:08:19,763 --> 01:08:22,163
And the women sleep with men!

1113
01:08:22,165 --> 01:08:25,300
But Jenny, who is... who is.
...Who is...

1114
01:08:25,302 --> 01:08:27,402
is generous and kind

1115
01:08:27,404 --> 01:08:29,637
and has never hurt anyone...

1116
01:08:29,639 --> 01:08:33,975
isn't normal and right, because she
wants to marry the woman she loves.

1117
01:08:35,578 --> 01:08:39,114
Jenny is good. And I love her.

1118
01:08:39,116 --> 01:08:42,717
And the only thing that
isn't normal and right is...

1119
01:08:42,719 --> 01:08:44,786
is me turning my back on that.

1120
01:08:44,788 --> 01:08:46,287
Oh, my...

1121
01:09:14,417 --> 01:09:16,918
- Hello.
<i>- It's Mom.</i>

1122
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:19,287
<i>Can you come down?</i>

1123
01:09:42,511 --> 01:09:44,145
- I saw a dress.

1124
01:09:45,915 --> 01:09:48,183
Months ago,
I saw a wedding dress.

1125
01:09:48,185 --> 01:09:49,350
I knew you'd look good in.

1126
01:09:49,352 --> 01:09:51,686
You still might be
able to get it.

1127
01:09:56,025 --> 01:09:58,326
I'm sorry, Jenny.

1128
01:09:59,428 --> 01:10:01,996
I'm so sorry for all of it.

1129
01:10:03,799 --> 01:10:07,602
And if you'll let me. I'd like to
help you pick out your wedding dress.

1130
01:10:09,104 --> 01:10:11,472
I want to be
part of your marriage.

1131
01:10:13,142 --> 01:10:17,011
I want to be part of everything
you do for the rest of your life.

1132
01:10:55,986 --> 01:10:58,052
- You're late.
You take 90 again?

1133
01:10:58,054 --> 01:11:01,055
- No. I took Carnegie.
- Oh, well.

1134
01:11:01,057 --> 01:11:05,360
Traffic on Carnegie can be
pretty bad after 3:00 too.

1135
01:11:05,362 --> 01:11:07,428
- I wasn't stuck in traffic.

1136
01:11:09,031 --> 01:11:11,032
I was with Jenny.

1137
01:11:16,038 --> 01:11:18,473
I want us to be
a part of the wedding.

1138
01:11:30,085 --> 01:11:33,405
We've always done everything together
for as long as we've been married.

1139
01:11:34,757 --> 01:11:39,360
But... I'll do this alone
if I have to.

1140
01:11:46,769 --> 01:11:49,237
At least talk to me about it.
- No.

1141
01:11:51,206 --> 01:11:53,141
No.

1142
01:11:55,110 --> 01:11:57,779
No, you've made your choice,
I've made mine.

1143
01:11:57,781 --> 01:12:00,181
I don't want to explain
it to anybody.

1144
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:40,421
- What are you
so happy about, Eddie?

1145
01:12:40,423 --> 01:12:43,424
- What?
- Nothing. Just a joke.

1146
01:13:03,679 --> 01:13:05,446
- Why isn't Denny O'Leary
here today?

1147
01:13:05,448 --> 01:13:07,715
- He changed
his shift yesterday.

1148
01:13:07,717 --> 01:13:09,217
- How come?

1149
01:13:09,219 --> 01:13:11,786
- I don't know.
Said it was personal.

1150
01:13:13,756 --> 01:13:16,924
- I've been on with him since
we were probies together.

1151
01:13:16,926 --> 01:13:20,528
- Lieutenant said he asked to change his
shift and wouldn't take no for an answer.

1152
01:13:26,268 --> 01:13:29,771
- I've known him since we were
in first grade together.

1153
01:13:29,773 --> 01:13:31,506
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

1154
01:13:31,508 --> 01:13:33,508
- That's a long time.

1155
01:13:38,380 --> 01:13:40,381
- Yeah. It is.

1156
01:13:51,026 --> 01:13:53,494
- What is that?
- Oh, look, you're awake.

1157
01:13:53,496 --> 01:13:55,563
- What? -Get up. I want
to show you something.

1158
01:13:55,565 --> 01:13:58,065
- Are you crazy? Do you have any idea
what time I went to bed last night?

1159
01:13:58,067 --> 01:14:01,869
- I said, get up. Look outside.

1160
01:14:08,811 --> 01:14:11,679
- At what?
- The grass.

1161
01:14:11,681 --> 01:14:14,382
- What about the grass?

1162
01:14:14,384 --> 01:14:16,617
- It's green.

1163
01:14:16,619 --> 01:14:19,020
- You think I care what color
the grass is?

1164
01:14:19,022 --> 01:14:21,923
- No. I don't.

1165
01:14:27,329 --> 01:14:29,697
- What are you doing?
- Packing your stuff.

1166
01:14:29,699 --> 01:14:30,865
You're moving out. <i> -What?</i>

1167
01:14:30,867 --> 01:14:32,233
I don't want to be married
to you anymore.

1168
01:14:32,235 --> 01:14:34,936
I would leave, but I don't think
it's good to move the kids

1169
01:14:34,938 --> 01:14:36,704
so you have to go.

1170
01:14:36,706 --> 01:14:38,806
- Come on, Anne, I know things
haven't been that...

1171
01:14:38,808 --> 01:14:42,343
- Stop. I'm not interested
in anything you have to say.

1172
01:14:42,345 --> 01:14:44,178
- You can't just kick me out
without talking about it.

1173
01:14:44,180 --> 01:14:46,380
- Why would we start talking
now. We haven't talked in years!

1174
01:14:46,382 --> 01:14:48,249
- 'Cause I have a right to know
why you're doing this.

1175
01:14:48,251 --> 01:14:49,784
- The grass.

1176
01:14:49,786 --> 01:14:51,853
- The grass?
- Yes.

1177
01:14:51,855 --> 01:14:57,124
When I looked at the dead grass,
I realized, I was unhappy.

1178
01:14:57,126 --> 01:15:00,495
Happy people
<i>don't</i> have dead grass.

1179
01:15:00,497 --> 01:15:03,898
And... and then it was like,
the chicken and the egg.

1180
01:15:03,900 --> 01:15:05,366
I couldn't figure out
which came first.

1181
01:15:05,368 --> 01:15:07,902
Happiness or green grass.

1182
01:15:09,905 --> 01:15:11,305
So I started watering it.

1183
01:15:11,307 --> 01:15:14,175
And the more I started watering
it, the happier I felt.

1184
01:15:17,679 --> 01:15:19,814
And then it came back to life.

1185
01:15:23,018 --> 01:15:25,453
- I don't blame you
for kicking Frankie out.

1186
01:15:25,455 --> 01:15:29,690
The guy's a bum.
But you know, grass is grass.

1187
01:15:29,692 --> 01:15:32,960
- No, it's not.
You don't have dead grass.

1188
01:15:32,962 --> 01:15:34,662
Michael doesn't have dead grass.

1189
01:15:34,664 --> 01:15:37,098
- No.
- Happy people don't.

1190
01:15:37,100 --> 01:15:40,535
And I never saw it until Jenny
came over and she was so happy.

1191
01:15:42,004 --> 01:15:45,439
I saw the dead grass
for the first time.

1192
01:15:45,441 --> 01:15:49,410
- I'll be right back.
I just have to change my order.

1193
01:15:49,412 --> 01:15:52,980
- She wouldn't have dead grass
any more than you would, Dad.

1194
01:15:54,449 --> 01:15:56,751
<i>She doesn't settle</i>
<i>for less either.</i>

1195
01:16:02,190 --> 01:16:04,191
- I don't know
where to seat anyone.

1196
01:16:04,193 --> 01:16:06,994
We're having twice
as many as we planned on having.

1197
01:16:06,996 --> 01:16:08,696
- I know.
Does it really matter?

1198
01:16:08,698 --> 01:16:11,365
Isn't everyone just
gonna be moving around anyway?

1199
01:16:11,367 --> 01:16:12,733
- Yeah.

1200
01:16:18,006 --> 01:16:20,274
- It's my father's
birthday today.

1201
01:16:21,343 --> 01:16:24,645
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

1202
01:16:24,647 --> 01:16:27,214
They're throwing a party for him
at my parents' house.

1203
01:16:30,752 --> 01:16:33,087
I'm gonna take a break, okay?
- Sure.

1204
01:16:43,198 --> 01:16:45,499
- He should know.
I should tell him.

1205
01:16:45,501 --> 01:16:48,569
- Michael should tell him.
He's the one doing it.

1206
01:16:48,571 --> 01:16:51,305
- I don't want to put,
I don't want to...

1207
01:16:51,307 --> 01:16:53,708
- What are you guys
talking about?

1208
01:16:53,710 --> 01:16:55,176
- Nothing.

1209
01:16:56,445 --> 01:16:58,312
- Are you sure?

1210
01:16:58,314 --> 01:17:00,514
- Yeah. No, I'll, uh,
I'll tell him.

1211
01:17:05,354 --> 01:17:06,754
Hey, listen, Dad...

1212
01:17:08,423 --> 01:17:13,127
uh, Jenny asked me
to walk her down the aisle.

1213
01:17:15,931 --> 01:17:17,832
And I said yes.

1214
01:20:06,735 --> 01:20:10,838
- What are you staring at?
- Nothing.

1215
01:20:10,840 --> 01:20:14,241
I saw Rose leave for
the wedding. She looked pretty.

1216
01:20:14,243 --> 01:20:16,777
- That is not a real wedding.

1217
01:20:16,779 --> 01:20:20,114
- Okay. I saw them leave
for the fake wedding.

1218
01:20:21,983 --> 01:20:23,517
No sign of Eddie.

1219
01:20:23,519 --> 01:20:25,719
- Well, at least he's got
his head screwed on right.

1220
01:20:25,721 --> 01:20:27,888
-<i> Honey.</i>

1221
01:20:27,890 --> 01:20:30,858
<i>We were there the night</i>
<i>Jenny was born.</i>

1222
01:20:30,860 --> 01:20:34,562
We'd always thought
that we'd be at her wedding.

1223
01:20:34,564 --> 01:20:37,665
- What makes you think
two women getting dressed up

1224
01:20:37,667 --> 01:20:41,335
in wedding gowns and prancing
down some hotel aisle

1225
01:20:41,337 --> 01:20:43,537
is the same as getting married?

1226
01:20:45,807 --> 01:20:47,441
- Jenny does.

1227
01:20:48,276 --> 01:20:49,443
- What?

1228
01:20:50,612 --> 01:20:52,613
- Jenny makes me think it.

1229
01:21:43,899 --> 01:21:44,999
- What are you doing here?

1230
01:21:45,001 --> 01:21:47,868
- I saw you drive up and uh...

1231
01:21:47,870 --> 01:21:50,404
door was unlocked so...

1232
01:21:50,406 --> 01:21:52,740
Look, um...

1233
01:21:54,976 --> 01:21:56,744
Maybe Ellen deserved it.

1234
01:21:56,746 --> 01:21:59,346
<i>I mean, we both know</i>
<i>how she can get.</i>

1235
01:21:59,348 --> 01:22:03,050
But you know, Rose said
some bad things to her and...

1236
01:22:03,052 --> 01:22:05,352
when something
really bothers me...

1237
01:22:05,354 --> 01:22:06,787
<i>I'm like you.</i>

1238
01:22:06,789 --> 01:22:09,323
You know, I... I dig in.

1239
01:22:12,661 --> 01:22:15,829
We've known each other
a long time and...

1240
01:22:15,831 --> 01:22:18,999
if I don't dig myself out...

1241
01:22:19,001 --> 01:22:21,235
I lose.

1242
01:22:21,237 --> 01:22:24,004
<i>And that's why I'm here.</i>
<i>To dig myself out.</i>

1243
01:22:25,707 --> 01:22:27,508
- How do you do that?

1244
01:22:29,577 --> 01:22:31,512
- I don't know.

1245
01:22:31,514 --> 01:22:34,315
I never had to do it before.

1246
01:22:34,317 --> 01:22:37,584
I guess I start with me,
I mean...

1247
01:22:37,586 --> 01:22:39,887
And that's why I'm here.

1248
01:22:39,889 --> 01:22:43,090
To dig myself out of me.

1249
01:23:00,909 --> 01:23:02,710
- Are you sure
that this isn't too much?

1250
01:23:02,712 --> 01:23:04,945
This dress isn't too much?
- It's a beautiful dress.

1251
01:23:04,947 --> 01:23:08,315
- Okay.
- Look... Eddie!

1252
01:23:08,317 --> 01:23:10,985
- I... I don't know
if you want me here, but uh...

1253
01:23:12,187 --> 01:23:14,321
I decided to come.

1254
01:23:14,323 --> 01:23:15,856
- Why wouldn't I want you here?

1255
01:23:15,858 --> 01:23:18,926
- Well, I, uh, I... I...

1256
01:23:18,928 --> 01:23:21,195
I turned my back on you.

1257
01:23:21,197 --> 01:23:23,263
- Oh, Dad, I...

1258
01:23:23,265 --> 01:23:27,334
I know how hard it is for you
to accept who I am, and...

1259
01:23:27,336 --> 01:23:29,169
I lied for so long,
and then... and then...

1260
01:23:29,171 --> 01:23:31,405
I said those horrible things
and I... I made you angry.

1261
01:23:31,407 --> 01:23:33,574
- No, no, no.
This has nothing to do with it.

1262
01:23:33,576 --> 01:23:35,676
I... I wasn't angry. I...

1263
01:23:37,112 --> 01:23:39,113
I walked away because uh...

1264
01:23:40,915 --> 01:23:42,916
Uh, because I was hurt.

1265
01:23:44,519 --> 01:23:46,053
You said you wanted me
out of your life

1266
01:23:46,055 --> 01:23:47,588
and you'd be relieved
when I was gone.

1267
01:23:47,590 --> 01:23:51,492
You said... you said you, uh...

1268
01:23:51,494 --> 01:23:54,161
you wouldn't miss me.

1269
01:23:54,163 --> 01:23:56,463
Me.

1270
01:23:56,465 --> 01:23:58,599
You wouldn't miss me.

1271
01:24:00,902 --> 01:24:02,636
I'm your dad.

1272
01:24:04,172 --> 01:24:08,776
Nobody has ever loved you more
than me, and nobody ever will.

1273
01:24:08,778 --> 01:24:10,778
How could you not miss me?

1274
01:24:13,815 --> 01:24:15,649
You see...

1275
01:24:15,651 --> 01:24:17,351
when, um...

1276
01:24:17,353 --> 01:24:19,686
when people hurt me, I... I...

1277
01:24:21,222 --> 01:24:23,223
I... I don't talk
about it. I...

1278
01:24:24,826 --> 01:24:26,427
I walk away.

1279
01:24:27,996 --> 01:24:29,797
I always walk away.

1280
01:24:30,899 --> 01:24:32,232
But, uh...

1281
01:24:33,802 --> 01:24:36,136
I can't walk away from you.

1282
01:24:38,239 --> 01:24:41,241
So... if that's okay...

1283
01:24:46,147 --> 01:24:48,849
You're my daughter.

1284
01:24:48,851 --> 01:24:51,852
A-and I would like
to walk you down the aisle.

1285
01:25:57,218 --> 01:25:59,887
- Living in a moment
I would die for.

1286
01:26:01,222 --> 01:26:04,525
These words best describe
every minute of everyday

1287
01:26:04,527 --> 01:26:06,960
of the last five years.

1288
01:26:06,962 --> 01:26:11,098
That's why I'm standing in front
of our family and our friends...

1289
01:26:11,100 --> 01:26:13,767
but most importantly,
in front of you...

1290
01:26:14,969 --> 01:26:17,671
and in the presence of God

1291
01:26:17,673 --> 01:26:21,742
to vow to be
your faithfully committed

1292
01:26:21,744 --> 01:26:24,344
lifetime companion.

1293
01:27:33,782 --> 01:27:36,683
- Do you know what I mean
about the grass, Aaron?

1294
01:27:36,685 --> 01:27:38,151
- Yes, I do.

1295
01:27:39,354 --> 01:27:42,556
- When I move away
and sell that house...

1296
01:27:42,558 --> 01:27:45,792
that grass will die
and I know it will.

1297
01:27:45,794 --> 01:27:48,095
But my grass...

1298
01:27:48,097 --> 01:27:51,732
the grass that is inside
of me will always be green.

1299
01:27:51,734 --> 01:27:55,235
Do you know what I mean?
- I do.

1300
01:27:55,237 --> 01:27:57,938
- Are you a lesbian?
- No.

1301
01:27:57,940 --> 01:27:59,273
- Good.

1302
01:28:00,942 --> 01:28:02,209
That's mine.

1303
01:30:01,396 --> 01:30:03,196
- Okay, everybody. This is it.

1304
01:30:03,198 --> 01:30:05,766
It's time for the conga line.

1305
01:30:05,768 --> 01:30:08,802
- Oh, my God.
I love the conga line.
