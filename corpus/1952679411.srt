1
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:51,603
So...

2
00:00:52,526 --> 00:00:56,226
So, Dr. T, I hear
your wife's sister...

3
00:00:56,696 --> 00:00:59,947
...moved back in with you
a few days ago.

4
00:01:01,451 --> 00:01:04,322
- Is that true?
- Yes, it is.

5
00:01:04,913 --> 00:01:07,451
Peggy, and three kids.

6
00:01:09,084 --> 00:01:10,792
I'm sorry.

7
00:01:12,546 --> 00:01:14,788
What is your wife's name?

8
00:01:15,132 --> 00:01:18,501
- Kate.
- Kate! Of course, Kate.

9
00:01:22,097 --> 00:01:26,047
And your wife's sister's name is...?

10
00:01:26,393 --> 00:01:29,762
- Peggy.
- Peggy! Peggy, yes, Peggy.

11
00:01:31,523 --> 00:01:36,019
So, how many children does Peggy
have now?

12
00:01:37,112 --> 00:01:38,523
She has three.

13
00:01:39,948 --> 00:01:42,274
- They have all girls.
- Three.

14
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:44,994
All girls?

15
00:01:47,789 --> 00:01:49,200
That's nice.

16
00:01:49,541 --> 00:01:51,035
Yes, it is.

17
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:55,127
Wouldn't have it any other way.

18
00:01:55,464 --> 00:01:57,088
Nor would I.

19
00:02:05,974 --> 00:02:08,347
Dr. Travis' office. May I help you?

20
00:02:10,187 --> 00:02:13,223
Oh, now, please tell me
that room's ready.

21
00:02:13,524 --> 00:02:15,849
Sweetie, everything okay in there?

22
00:02:17,361 --> 00:02:20,066
Didn't I tell you
you'd be in this room?

23
00:02:20,406 --> 00:02:22,232
You did. You're so good.

24
00:02:22,574 --> 00:02:24,199
Oh, I hope so.

25
00:02:26,245 --> 00:02:27,525
Marsha?

26
00:02:28,455 --> 00:02:29,535
- Marsha?
- Yeah.

27
00:02:29,874 --> 00:02:32,958
Darling, insurance, new payments,
is that...?

28
00:02:33,252 --> 00:02:34,912
You've got an appointment?

29
00:02:35,212 --> 00:02:37,703
- Your name?
- Nina Shipman. From Corpus.

30
00:02:38,007 --> 00:02:42,752
Joanne, you've got a new insurance,
did you know that?

31
00:02:43,971 --> 00:02:45,714
I thought that was for me.

32
00:02:46,056 --> 00:02:49,639
I bet you do. Once for every store.
Plus an extra.

33
00:02:49,977 --> 00:02:51,720
I might. I think I might.

34
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,239
- Allison, sweetie.
- Yes?

35
00:03:06,577 --> 00:03:09,246
Miss Shipman. First timer.

36
00:03:14,001 --> 00:03:16,753
Insurance information, the new one.

37
00:03:20,758 --> 00:03:22,003
Hey, everybody.

38
00:03:22,343 --> 00:03:24,501
Abbey, how are you?
You look beautiful.

39
00:03:24,845 --> 00:03:28,546
Here's some brand new information
you've never heard in this office:

40
00:03:28,891 --> 00:03:32,391
We're running late.
Now how could that happen...

41
00:03:32,728 --> 00:03:34,271
...every day?

42
00:03:35,398 --> 00:03:38,648
- Hey, Liz. How you doing?
- Liz, how are you?

43
00:03:40,278 --> 00:03:43,860
Five minutes is about all we can do,
and that'll be a miracle.

44
00:03:52,707 --> 00:03:54,913
I'll be back in a second.

45
00:03:57,337 --> 00:03:59,958
Hi, Mrs. Larson. How are you today?

46
00:04:00,298 --> 00:04:01,840
I'll take you over to Judy.

47
00:04:02,175 --> 00:04:07,003
We're gonna set up tests for you and
appointments for the next few weeks.

48
00:04:11,643 --> 00:04:13,801
Liz! Hi, how are you?

49
00:04:14,145 --> 00:04:15,687
You look a little pale.

50
00:04:16,022 --> 00:04:19,438
- Never been better.
- Don't forget my garden party.

51
00:04:19,776 --> 00:04:21,934
Oh, yeah, yeah. I will. I will.

52
00:04:22,278 --> 00:04:25,149
Make sure. I will never
forgive you if you don't.

53
00:04:25,907 --> 00:04:28,113
Hello, Judy.

54
00:04:28,451 --> 00:04:32,698
I've got a meeting with the mayor.
You won't make me wait, will you?

55
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:36,657
You should call him and tell him
you need to see your ob-gyn.

56
00:04:37,001 --> 00:04:40,205
As usual in a doctor's office,
you'll have to wait.

57
00:04:40,547 --> 00:04:44,129
I know you shouldn't have to, but our
doctor doesn't understand that.

58
00:04:44,426 --> 00:04:47,177
But I've already done my breast exam.

59
00:04:47,512 --> 00:04:51,011
Great, we should give you extra
points for that. Or a deduction.

60
00:04:51,349 --> 00:04:53,342
- You're in my seat.
- I'm sorry.

61
00:04:53,685 --> 00:04:56,258
Give me just a few more minutes.

62
00:04:56,605 --> 00:04:58,930
- How much time?
- I don't know, 30.

63
00:05:04,529 --> 00:05:07,732
- That bathroom is disgusting.
- The bathroom?

64
00:05:08,074 --> 00:05:09,569
Yes, it is.

65
00:05:12,871 --> 00:05:18,210
How many people are you "working in"?
Can the doctor say no to anybody?

66
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:47,361
Pull!

67
00:05:48,532 --> 00:05:51,105
- I think I might've grazed that one.
- A definite...

68
00:05:51,785 --> 00:05:53,327
- Almost.
- Almost.

69
00:05:53,662 --> 00:05:55,619
You saw that spin to the right.

70
00:05:56,123 --> 00:05:58,578
Yeah, that was a sure thing there.

71
00:05:58,917 --> 00:06:01,835
- Bernadette Rose is in.
- Hey, Sully.

72
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:05,255
You and me, head to head,
five bucks a shot.

73
00:06:05,841 --> 00:06:09,008
Why don't you just give him
your ATM card and be done?

74
00:06:10,512 --> 00:06:11,923
Are you ready for this?

75
00:06:12,514 --> 00:06:13,795
We're ready.

76
00:06:18,353 --> 00:06:20,263
- Holy shit.
- Oh, man!

77
00:06:20,564 --> 00:06:21,311
Unbelievable.

78
00:06:21,648 --> 00:06:22,929
How do you do that?

79
00:06:23,275 --> 00:06:24,438
Want my secret?

80
00:06:25,027 --> 00:06:26,651
Bernadette Rose.

81
00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:28,861
Never take a good woman for granted.

82
00:06:29,615 --> 00:06:33,399
You and Sully had the perfect day.
You were the perfect couple.

83
00:06:33,702 --> 00:06:37,202
I was the little
geeky 8-year-old...

84
00:06:37,539 --> 00:06:40,327
...just trying to be proper.

85
00:06:40,668 --> 00:06:44,879
But it was so wonderful and that's
the way it should be.

86
00:06:45,339 --> 00:06:50,416
I want it to be the perfect wedding...
I was gonna say "of her life."

87
00:06:50,761 --> 00:06:54,889
The only wedding of her life,
that's the perfect wedding.

88
00:06:55,182 --> 00:06:58,017
Look at these.
This is what I was talking about.

89
00:06:58,352 --> 00:07:00,095
Your phone's ringing.

90
00:07:02,565 --> 00:07:06,514
Every time I hear it,
I assume it's somebody else's.

91
00:07:07,778 --> 00:07:09,272
Excuse me.

92
00:07:09,905 --> 00:07:11,565
Oh, good grief.

93
00:07:12,783 --> 00:07:15,108
Hello? Hey, baby girl.

94
00:07:15,411 --> 00:07:19,325
Mommy, we're playing doctor and Amber
won't go tee-tee when I say...

95
00:07:19,665 --> 00:07:20,744
...and Maria won't help.

96
00:07:21,542 --> 00:07:23,369
Girl, you did not.

97
00:07:23,711 --> 00:07:26,332
If Amber doesn't want to go,
don't make her.

98
00:07:27,757 --> 00:07:29,796
Honey, that's Uncle Sully's.

99
00:07:30,301 --> 00:07:32,459
You do not tee-tee on those sticks.

100
00:07:32,803 --> 00:07:34,463
Give me... Let me talk to Maria.

101
00:07:34,805 --> 00:07:37,296
- Mommy, when are you coming home?
- Give me.

102
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,798
Sorry, wrong number.

103
00:07:39,477 --> 00:07:41,516
May I be of some assistance?

104
00:07:41,854 --> 00:07:43,313
Thank you, not right now.

105
00:07:43,648 --> 00:07:46,851
If there's anything I can do,
my name is Tiffany.

106
00:07:47,193 --> 00:07:49,102
Your name's Tiffany?

107
00:07:49,403 --> 00:07:50,185
Tiffany!

108
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:52,653
Kind of a coincidence, I know.

109
00:08:00,456 --> 00:08:01,238
Dee Dee!

110
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:06,242
You're late. We were supposed to meet
at the fountain at 2:00.

111
00:08:06,587 --> 00:08:09,339
Where are you going?
Tiffany's is that way.

112
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:12,258
You said the fountain at 2:00.

113
00:08:12,552 --> 00:08:14,628
No, I said Tiffany's at 2:15.

114
00:08:14,971 --> 00:08:16,631
I swear you said the fountain.

115
00:08:16,973 --> 00:08:19,345
We're here for
the bridal registration.

116
00:08:19,642 --> 00:08:21,434
Are you the bride?

117
00:08:21,769 --> 00:08:24,391
No. No. I am...

118
00:08:24,689 --> 00:08:29,351
...getting a divorce probably myself.
But my niece is getting married.

119
00:08:29,694 --> 00:08:32,102
- Great!
- Kate, my sister, called.

120
00:08:32,447 --> 00:08:34,404
- What's her name?
- Mrs. Travis.

121
00:08:34,741 --> 00:08:35,820
Pull.

122
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:39,615
- That was gorgeous.
- You hooked it.

123
00:08:39,954 --> 00:08:42,077
That was a draw, a beautiful draw.

124
00:08:42,373 --> 00:08:45,410
I know a hook when I see a hook.

125
00:08:46,169 --> 00:08:49,834
If we were quail hunting, Eli,
I'm afraid you'd be going hungry.

126
00:08:50,173 --> 00:08:53,340
Hungry! Oh, damn, I forgot.
I got sandwiches here.

127
00:08:53,635 --> 00:08:55,093
Break time.

128
00:08:55,428 --> 00:08:58,880
- Pimiento cheese sandwiches.
- Grab that chair.

129
00:08:59,224 --> 00:09:02,141
Always a pleasure
to put the feedbag on at Sully's.

130
00:09:02,477 --> 00:09:04,517
- Alrighty.
- Dr. T's Roadhouse, huh?

131
00:09:04,979 --> 00:09:06,723
They're not gonna be here.

132
00:09:07,065 --> 00:09:11,015
- I told them to meet us at Tiffany's.
- Look, they're not here.

133
00:09:11,361 --> 00:09:12,440
There's Mom.

134
00:09:16,866 --> 00:09:20,235
- Hi.
- Oh, it's you.

135
00:09:20,662 --> 00:09:22,785
- Hi, baby.
- Hi.

136
00:09:23,123 --> 00:09:23,905
How are you?

137
00:09:24,249 --> 00:09:27,119
Here we are, champagne for everyone.

138
00:09:27,794 --> 00:09:30,250
- Hi, Ma.
- Hi, honey.

139
00:09:30,589 --> 00:09:31,751
This is the bride.

140
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:33,632
- Dee Dee Travis.
- Tiffany.

141
00:09:33,967 --> 00:09:35,794
- Oh, how cute.
- Here you go.

142
00:09:36,136 --> 00:09:39,006
- I don't drink.
- Shall we look at some flatware?

143
00:09:39,347 --> 00:09:42,135
Peggy, I love your hat.
It's beautiful.

144
00:09:42,476 --> 00:09:45,097
- Can I try it on?
- Of course you can.

145
00:09:45,437 --> 00:09:46,931
You look so good in hats.

146
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:50,480
- How does it look?
- That looks so good on you.

147
00:09:50,817 --> 00:09:51,980
Doesn't it look great?

148
00:09:52,319 --> 00:09:54,276
Peggy has that same hat.

149
00:09:54,613 --> 00:09:55,893
This is Peggy's hat.

150
00:09:56,239 --> 00:09:58,232
"Autobahn." That's funny.

151
00:09:58,575 --> 00:10:00,532
A little contemporary for you.

152
00:10:00,869 --> 00:10:02,577
It's very delicate.

153
00:10:03,705 --> 00:10:06,031
What a beautiful ring. Is it ours?

154
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:08,118
No, it's Harry Winston's.

155
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:12,410
I think she actually preferred
the Swag Collection.

156
00:10:12,756 --> 00:10:15,081
I don't like the Swag Collection.

157
00:10:15,384 --> 00:10:18,966
It makes a very opulent display,
doesn't it?

158
00:10:19,429 --> 00:10:22,514
- What kind of pattern is this?
- This is chrysanthemum.

159
00:10:33,694 --> 00:10:36,481
- And a pimiento cheese sandwich.
- Something different.

160
00:10:36,822 --> 00:10:39,028
A pimiento cheese sandwich.

161
00:10:39,324 --> 00:10:40,735
Thirty-five dollars.

162
00:10:41,034 --> 00:10:43,870
- I'll have the pimiento cheese.
- I love the variety.

163
00:10:44,163 --> 00:10:48,575
I have never spent $35
on a pimiento cheese sandwich...

164
00:10:49,835 --> 00:10:53,453
...but it's good. It hits the spot.
Who made these, by the way?

165
00:10:54,798 --> 00:10:57,289
How is Kate? Haven't seen her lately.

166
00:10:57,593 --> 00:11:01,970
Yeah, she's... She's all involved
with Dee Dee's wedding.

167
00:11:02,306 --> 00:11:04,548
That's a full-time job:
Women and weddings.

168
00:11:04,892 --> 00:11:08,059
When I hear you, it makes
me glad I don't have a wife.

169
00:11:08,354 --> 00:11:11,058
When you get one, make sure
she's like Sully's.

170
00:11:11,398 --> 00:11:14,732
You're a lucky man, Sully.
Hang on to her.

171
00:11:16,362 --> 00:11:17,856
I'm trying.

172
00:11:27,415 --> 00:11:28,695
Mom?

173
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:32,868
Have you seen Mom?

174
00:11:33,212 --> 00:11:35,584
- She was right here.
- Ma?

175
00:11:38,634 --> 00:11:40,508
She was right here.

176
00:11:40,845 --> 00:11:44,344
- Oh, miss. Miss?
- What?

177
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,051
The knife.

178
00:11:46,392 --> 00:11:48,135
- I'll see you later.
- Okay.

179
00:11:52,231 --> 00:11:54,556
- There it is.
- Sorry, we're just leaving.

180
00:11:54,859 --> 00:11:57,101
Thank you so much for everything.

181
00:11:57,445 --> 00:12:01,656
That was sweet, and this is just
the best champagne. I love it!

182
00:12:01,991 --> 00:12:04,778
- A toast to you, Tiffany.
- Well, cheers.

183
00:12:05,328 --> 00:12:08,827
The namesake of the store.
Bless your sweet heart. Thank you.

184
00:12:09,165 --> 00:12:11,454
- Where's Peggy?
- God, there you are.

185
00:12:11,792 --> 00:12:14,366
Mom's gone and I gotta go. Okay?

186
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:18,336
Why did you let her come out?
You know how absent-minded Mom's been.

187
00:12:18,674 --> 00:12:20,217
She'll find her way home.

188
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:25,006
She woke up in the middle of the night
and pitched a tent in the backyard.

189
00:12:25,348 --> 00:12:29,215
- Girls, I think I'm gonna need a ride.
- I'll give you a ride.

190
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:32,016
She made pimiento cheese sandwiches
for breakfast.

191
00:12:32,355 --> 00:12:34,264
Daddy likes pimiento cheese.

192
00:12:34,607 --> 00:12:36,647
- Give me some air.
- Something's wrong.

193
00:12:36,985 --> 00:12:39,606
Where do you think Kate went, anyway?

194
00:13:05,346 --> 00:13:07,339
- Snuck up on us, didn't it?
- Let's go.

195
00:13:07,682 --> 00:13:10,054
It looks like it's gonna piss down.

196
00:13:10,351 --> 00:13:11,727
Come on, let's go.

197
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:13,515
Oh, shit.

198
00:13:15,648 --> 00:13:16,514
Get your gun.

199
00:13:16,858 --> 00:13:20,903
Oh, shit, my gun,
my gun, my gun.

200
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:25,066
- Get in the damn car.
- You're gonna get Lucille wet.

201
00:13:25,408 --> 00:13:27,816
That's all right.
I like my women wet.

202
00:13:28,161 --> 00:13:30,450
Maybe that's why she can't hit a barn.

203
00:13:30,789 --> 00:13:33,458
You of all people got something
against wet women?

204
00:13:33,792 --> 00:13:36,543
You know, certain Indian tribes say...

205
00:13:36,878 --> 00:13:40,543
...if a woman's all wet the first time
you see her it's bad luck.

206
00:13:40,882 --> 00:13:43,420
- You think that's true?
- It's pure horse shit.

207
00:13:43,718 --> 00:13:45,296
Oh, shit!

208
00:14:27,262 --> 00:14:31,841
Oh, my God!
Where'd that come from?

209
00:14:32,935 --> 00:14:34,512
Look at you.

210
00:14:35,687 --> 00:14:40,349
- Sorry I'm getting your carpet wet.
- It's just carpet. It'll dry.

211
00:14:40,692 --> 00:14:43,266
Yeah, it's raining.
Rain'll make you wet.

212
00:14:43,654 --> 00:14:45,362
Yes, it will.

213
00:14:45,739 --> 00:14:47,198
Is Harlan here?

214
00:14:47,533 --> 00:14:50,368
No, Harlan said he was gonna be
hunting all day.

215
00:14:50,869 --> 00:14:52,778
- Hunting?
- That's what he said.

216
00:14:53,122 --> 00:14:55,410
- Can we help you?
- I'm Bree Davis.

217
00:14:55,749 --> 00:14:57,160
- I'm Randy.
- How are you?

218
00:14:57,501 --> 00:14:59,790
You're the new golf pro chick.

219
00:15:00,129 --> 00:15:02,702
I'm the new assistant golf pro chick.

220
00:15:03,924 --> 00:15:06,676
Wow, Bree. That's one
interesting name.

221
00:15:07,011 --> 00:15:09,383
Is it Brie like the cheese or...

222
00:15:09,722 --> 00:15:12,676
No. It's Bree like breed,
without the "d."

223
00:15:24,737 --> 00:15:27,275
This'll wake your soul right up.

224
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:33,865
It's rain! It is raining!

225
00:15:34,205 --> 00:15:36,244
Be careful, there's puddles.

226
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:39,290
You are so sweet to bring me back.

227
00:15:39,627 --> 00:15:42,296
- It's okay, Peggy.
- I love this!

228
00:15:48,969 --> 00:15:50,428
Soaking wet!

229
00:15:51,222 --> 00:15:52,716
Girls!

230
00:15:53,641 --> 00:15:55,301
Mommy's back!

231
00:15:55,601 --> 00:15:57,973
Wait till you see. Look at me.

232
00:15:58,312 --> 00:16:01,479
We got caught in the rain, Maria.

233
00:16:01,816 --> 00:16:03,559
I'm gonna get you all wet.

234
00:16:04,735 --> 00:16:06,395
Oh, little fairies.

235
00:16:08,322 --> 00:16:10,860
- Where's Mom?
- I thought she was with you.

236
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,231
Has she called?

237
00:16:32,722 --> 00:16:34,465
Is there someplace I can put this?

238
00:16:34,807 --> 00:16:38,472
Yeah, yeah. There's some cubbyholes
back there in the back.

239
00:16:38,811 --> 00:16:40,389
Throw it there, that'd be fine.

240
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:42,438
- Who is that guy?
- That guy?

241
00:16:43,107 --> 00:16:45,942
That's Harvey Penick.
He's a famous golf guy.

242
00:16:46,277 --> 00:16:48,186
I know who he is. Who's that?

243
00:16:48,488 --> 00:16:52,320
Dr. Travis. He's one of our members.
He's been here a long time.

244
00:16:52,617 --> 00:16:54,277
What kind of doctor is he?

245
00:16:54,619 --> 00:16:56,327
He's the lucky kind.

246
00:17:13,221 --> 00:17:15,712
It is coming down, man!

247
00:17:19,143 --> 00:17:21,183
It's good to see you. How are you?

248
00:17:21,521 --> 00:17:23,560
- I'm getting you wet.
- That's okay.

249
00:17:23,898 --> 00:17:27,813
- I thought you were coming tomorrow.
- I was, but I just kept driving.

250
00:17:28,278 --> 00:17:32,489
Let me get out of these things. This
is Bree Davis, the new assistant pro.

251
00:17:32,824 --> 00:17:35,362
- How are you?
- I'm all wet, how you doing?

252
00:17:35,702 --> 00:17:37,944
- I'm gonna change.
- Hi. I'm Bree.

253
00:17:38,288 --> 00:17:40,197
Sully Travis. Nice to meet you.

254
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:41,703
Are you Dr. Travis?

255
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:44,207
Yeah, or Dr. T.

256
00:17:44,794 --> 00:17:46,917
Most people just call me Dr. T.

257
00:17:47,255 --> 00:17:49,829
Well, it's very nice to meet you,
Dr. T.

258
00:17:50,175 --> 00:17:53,460
- You said your name was Bree?
- Not like the cheese.

259
00:17:53,762 --> 00:17:57,095
- B-R-E-E like breed or...
- Breech.

260
00:17:57,432 --> 00:17:58,891
Without the "c-h."

261
00:17:59,267 --> 00:18:01,094
I never heard that, but sure.

262
00:18:01,811 --> 00:18:03,306
How'd you know I'm a doctor?

263
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:08,641
I looked at your picture and thought
you looked familiar, so I asked.

264
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:23,034
That is out of control!

265
00:18:47,608 --> 00:18:51,522
I met my first girlfriend
at a pool party when I was 16.

266
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:53,149
Soaking wet, she was.

267
00:18:54,114 --> 00:18:57,234
And I swear, within a week
I started losing my hair.

268
00:18:57,534 --> 00:18:59,159
You guys are crazy.

269
00:18:59,661 --> 00:19:03,113
Superstition is for the unimaginative.

270
00:19:03,457 --> 00:19:06,577
My imagination knows a mare's nest
when it sees one.

271
00:19:06,919 --> 00:19:09,410
- What's a mare's nest?
- Like a wolf in sheep's clothing.

272
00:19:10,047 --> 00:19:12,716
- Wet clothing, in her case.
- You know your problem?

273
00:19:13,008 --> 00:19:14,835
- Who, me?
- All of you.

274
00:19:15,177 --> 00:19:16,885
You don't understand women.

275
00:19:17,179 --> 00:19:20,050
Women are incapable of being bad luck
by themselves.

276
00:19:20,391 --> 00:19:22,300
It's men who make them that way.

277
00:19:22,851 --> 00:19:26,719
Women are, by nature, they are saints.

278
00:19:27,064 --> 00:19:29,555
They're sacred, and should be
treated as such.

279
00:19:30,484 --> 00:19:34,564
The lady, the new golf lady.
The cheese...

280
00:19:35,823 --> 00:19:39,607
She's outside. She said she wants
to talk to you. It's important.

281
00:19:46,166 --> 00:19:48,076
Well, hello again, Bree.

282
00:19:48,419 --> 00:19:50,910
I'm getting singles for liar's poker,
you want some?

283
00:19:51,213 --> 00:19:53,787
- So what's up?
- Your wife called.

284
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,709
Did she say what she wanted?

285
00:19:57,052 --> 00:20:00,468
It actually wasn't your wife.
It was the police.

286
00:20:00,806 --> 00:20:03,095
They need you to come down
to the station.

287
00:20:03,434 --> 00:20:05,261
They said downtown.

288
00:20:06,395 --> 00:20:07,973
Thanks. Thank you.

289
00:20:09,899 --> 00:20:12,853
Well, about my client, Kate Travis.

290
00:20:13,152 --> 00:20:15,939
Will she be in
in about half an hour?

291
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,237
Can I make an appointment?

292
00:20:18,574 --> 00:20:20,899
All right. Thanks very much.

293
00:20:21,285 --> 00:20:24,239
Can you hurry that up?
Can we let my client out?

294
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:26,573
You made me make a mistake.

295
00:20:30,461 --> 00:20:31,540
Darling?

296
00:20:33,506 --> 00:20:35,083
Did something happen there?

297
00:20:35,675 --> 00:20:39,672
Is that why you did it? Why did you
take your clothes off in the mall?

298
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:46,802
My sleeves got wet
and they got really, really long...

299
00:20:47,144 --> 00:20:49,184
...like a straitjacket.

300
00:20:52,275 --> 00:20:55,940
Did you go in the fountain?
You didn't even get wet.

301
00:21:03,077 --> 00:21:04,488
Hey, talk to me.

302
00:21:19,469 --> 00:21:21,508
- Hi.
- Hey.

303
00:21:24,349 --> 00:21:28,263
You think there's someplace
I could take a bath here?

304
00:21:35,777 --> 00:21:37,520
We'll do that when we get home.

305
00:23:39,193 --> 00:23:43,190
Oh, no. We can't do that anymore.

306
00:23:43,947 --> 00:23:45,358
It's not nice.

307
00:24:37,918 --> 00:24:40,789
Right now I'm not ruling anything out.

308
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:45,673
Especially since I personally have
never had a case like Kate's before.

309
00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:50,257
But I am looking into
a lot of possibilities.

310
00:24:50,598 --> 00:24:54,014
One of which is called
the Hestia Complex.

311
00:24:55,686 --> 00:24:57,762
Hestia Complex? What is it?

312
00:24:58,189 --> 00:25:02,139
Hestia was a Greek goddess. She was
the goddess of the home and hearth.

313
00:25:02,485 --> 00:25:06,185
She kept the fires burning.
She was the guardian of family life.

314
00:25:07,615 --> 00:25:12,443
But in an interesting contradiction,
she came to despise love...

315
00:25:13,329 --> 00:25:15,238
...and consequently, to reject it.

316
00:25:17,792 --> 00:25:20,876
Eventually, she retreated
to a single life...

317
00:25:22,588 --> 00:25:25,258
...and peculiarly, was allowed...

318
00:25:25,591 --> 00:25:28,676
...to become the guardian
of virginal modesty.

319
00:25:30,888 --> 00:25:33,095
What has all this got to do with Kate?

320
00:25:35,226 --> 00:25:40,386
In clinical psychology, as well
as in my own documented theories...

321
00:25:40,732 --> 00:25:42,309
...which are based in mythology...

322
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:45,058
...virgin essentially means child.

323
00:25:45,653 --> 00:25:48,987
Now Kate has retreated
into a childlike state.

324
00:25:49,324 --> 00:25:52,325
There could be any number
of reasons for it.

325
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:57,287
At this point... And yes, I must...

326
00:25:57,582 --> 00:26:00,499
...look into all the possibilities.
But at this point...

327
00:26:00,835 --> 00:26:04,370
...the Hestia Complex
seems the most likely.

328
00:26:14,099 --> 00:26:17,099
All right. Take a deep puff.

329
00:26:21,439 --> 00:26:22,933
All right, no puff.

330
00:26:25,735 --> 00:26:27,977
Oh, wow, this fur is great.

331
00:26:28,321 --> 00:26:30,859
Didn't it used to be sheepskin
or something?

332
00:26:31,533 --> 00:26:35,696
My aunt died in August and she gave me
this ratty old mink coat.

333
00:26:36,037 --> 00:26:38,789
It was falling apart,
but the sleeves were still good.

334
00:26:39,374 --> 00:26:41,912
It was just enough to cover
the three rooms.

335
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,379
I left Kate a message...

336
00:26:45,714 --> 00:26:49,213
You're the only one I let smoke
in here. Will you give me a break?

337
00:26:49,551 --> 00:26:52,754
I left Kate a message last week,
but she never called me back.

338
00:26:53,096 --> 00:26:57,592
Yeah, well, she's away
for a while now.

339
00:26:57,934 --> 00:27:00,425
Sorry, I haven't been
very good about...

340
00:27:00,729 --> 00:27:02,603
...checking her voice mail.

341
00:27:02,939 --> 00:27:04,766
Look at me. Look up. There.

342
00:27:05,108 --> 00:27:08,026
Actually, I just wanted to talk
to you about something.

343
00:27:08,361 --> 00:27:09,856
What about? Lie down.

344
00:27:10,197 --> 00:27:13,648
Well, I'm president of the Beauty
and Fairness for Dallas Club.

345
00:27:13,992 --> 00:27:15,071
Is that a new club?

346
00:27:16,286 --> 00:27:18,445
We're a spinoff of the Garden Club.

347
00:27:18,789 --> 00:27:20,746
We promote women's issues.

348
00:27:21,083 --> 00:27:25,745
We're looking for a male voice to help
present our cause to the city council.

349
00:27:26,088 --> 00:27:27,498
What's the cause?

350
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:31,754
The freeway issue. We think
one should be named for a woman.

351
00:27:33,971 --> 00:27:37,505
Do you realize that every freeway
in Dallas is named for a man?

352
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:53,271
I'm so terribly sorry.
I hope you'll forgive me.

353
00:28:06,545 --> 00:28:08,668
- Hi, Peggy!
- Hey, honey!

354
00:28:09,006 --> 00:28:11,461
- How are you?
- You look so wonderful.

355
00:28:17,264 --> 00:28:20,764
Connie, did you see that? Hi, Judy.

356
00:28:22,937 --> 00:28:26,804
- Oh, hey, Peggy, nice to see you.
- We're going to see Dad.

357
00:28:27,107 --> 00:28:29,349
We need to talk to him about Mom.

358
00:28:29,652 --> 00:28:32,439
Dad, we're here.
Could you come here please?

359
00:28:33,781 --> 00:28:35,572
So will you help us?

360
00:28:36,367 --> 00:28:38,692
Well, who do you have so far?

361
00:28:40,079 --> 00:28:41,241
Annette Strauss, for one.

362
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:43,906
Oh, Annette! God rest her soul.

363
00:28:44,625 --> 00:28:48,492
She was proof that women
make great mayors.

364
00:28:49,004 --> 00:28:51,958
- We also thought about Mary Kay Ash.
- Good choice.

365
00:28:52,299 --> 00:28:54,257
Someone with international influence.

366
00:28:54,844 --> 00:28:57,513
I'm touching your leg and entering.
Easy.

367
00:28:57,847 --> 00:28:58,842
There we are. Okay.

368
00:28:59,181 --> 00:29:01,008
How many names do you need?

369
00:29:01,309 --> 00:29:04,144
Three. You got another suggestion?

370
00:29:05,479 --> 00:29:09,560
What about one to get the attention
of the good ol' boys on the council?

371
00:29:10,484 --> 00:29:12,062
You know, like...

372
00:29:12,403 --> 00:29:13,731
Jayne Mansfield.

373
00:29:14,238 --> 00:29:16,860
All right, that's it. Cutoff.

374
00:29:17,158 --> 00:29:20,823
No more cigarettes in here.
Don't even ask me next time.

375
00:29:21,829 --> 00:29:24,367
Jayne Mansfield. What a great idea.

376
00:29:27,543 --> 00:29:29,203
Hey, Dee Dee, look.

377
00:29:29,545 --> 00:29:33,329
Put that back before he comes in.
That's his drawer.

378
00:29:34,634 --> 00:29:36,626
Hi, everybody. What's up?

379
00:29:36,969 --> 00:29:37,918
Out of my drawers.

380
00:29:38,221 --> 00:29:39,383
Squid, just move on.

381
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:42,634
- I hate "Squid."
- I hate when you're in my drawers.

382
00:29:42,975 --> 00:29:47,139
Sully, we're just so sorry
to interrupt your busy day.

383
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,936
He's writing up a prescription.

384
00:29:50,274 --> 00:29:52,314
Take this out of samples.

385
00:29:53,111 --> 00:29:55,981
I don't want to see her
for three months.

386
00:29:56,322 --> 00:29:57,982
- Okay.
- You want me to shut the door?

387
00:29:58,324 --> 00:29:59,735
Please. Thanks.

388
00:30:00,034 --> 00:30:02,525
- Thanks, Carolyn.
- What's up?

389
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:07,364
We just wanted to take
a few minutes and talk about Kate.

390
00:30:07,917 --> 00:30:10,040
- We're real concerned.
- Basically...

391
00:30:10,378 --> 00:30:12,287
...we should get Mom out.

392
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:15,465
I see no reason why she
can't stay home with us.

393
00:30:15,758 --> 00:30:17,466
You know we can't do that.

394
00:30:17,802 --> 00:30:20,507
The psychiatric hospital is
the best place for her.

395
00:30:21,055 --> 00:30:25,468
They've assured me that
the facility in Tyler is first-rate.

396
00:30:26,269 --> 00:30:29,305
Dr. Harper talks to Kate
several times a day.

397
00:30:29,647 --> 00:30:31,106
She says she's happy there.

398
00:30:31,441 --> 00:30:33,730
Do we really know that she's happy?

399
00:30:34,069 --> 00:30:37,769
I mean, if we haven't seen her?

400
00:30:38,782 --> 00:30:40,905
Kate's been there three weeks.

401
00:30:41,409 --> 00:30:44,161
She hasn't asked about us once.
Any of us.

402
00:30:44,496 --> 00:30:47,615
- I don't believe it.
- Dr. Harper said that?

403
00:30:47,958 --> 00:30:50,912
Does anybody have any idea
what's wrong with her yet?

404
00:30:51,795 --> 00:30:53,918
They're about as stumped as we are.

405
00:30:54,256 --> 00:30:57,256
Dad, that's exactly why
we need to bring her home.

406
00:30:57,550 --> 00:30:59,377
At least we could take care of her.

407
00:30:59,719 --> 00:31:02,804
Well, Dr. Harper did say one thing.

408
00:31:04,099 --> 00:31:05,297
What?

409
00:31:05,642 --> 00:31:08,429
There is a rare...

410
00:31:10,814 --> 00:31:13,649
...mental disorder that they're just
learning about right now.

411
00:31:13,984 --> 00:31:18,147
It's a condition, a complex,
called the Hestia Complex.

412
00:31:18,488 --> 00:31:20,315
- Hestia Complex?
- I don't know it.

413
00:31:20,615 --> 00:31:23,023
Apparently it only affects women.

414
00:31:24,745 --> 00:31:29,703
From the few studies they've done,
women who are most susceptible...

415
00:31:32,753 --> 00:31:34,128
Are what?

416
00:31:35,797 --> 00:31:36,793
Say it, Dad.

417
00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:38,882
Women who are loved too much.

418
00:31:39,217 --> 00:31:40,213
Loved too much?

419
00:31:40,552 --> 00:31:44,051
Mom has this disease
because we love her too much?

420
00:31:44,473 --> 00:31:46,845
I think you've gone crazy, Daddy.

421
00:31:47,184 --> 00:31:48,464
It's not about you.

422
00:31:48,810 --> 00:31:50,803
But that sounds very strange.

423
00:31:51,146 --> 00:31:53,305
Listen to me. Understand me. Now.

424
00:31:53,607 --> 00:31:56,359
This is not because of anything
you have done. It's me.

425
00:31:56,693 --> 00:31:59,149
What do you mean, Sully?

426
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:01,030
Listen. Dr. Harper says...

427
00:32:01,365 --> 00:32:03,073
Dr. Harper.

428
00:32:03,408 --> 00:32:07,702
...this syndrome, or this Hestia
thing, whatever this thing is...

429
00:32:08,038 --> 00:32:10,161
...this is something that attacks...

430
00:32:10,749 --> 00:32:12,457
...mostly upper-class women who...

431
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:15,998
Who have pretty much
everything they need...

432
00:32:16,922 --> 00:32:19,674
...in a material sense
and in a family sense too.

433
00:32:20,008 --> 00:32:21,467
But they also have...

434
00:32:22,094 --> 00:32:24,763
...well, a man, a husband who...

435
00:32:26,181 --> 00:32:28,507
...loves them and adores them...

436
00:32:29,852 --> 00:32:31,679
...is faithful and respects them...

437
00:32:32,021 --> 00:32:34,975
...always puts them first,
totally takes care of them...

438
00:32:35,357 --> 00:32:37,184
...makes them feel beautiful.

439
00:32:37,526 --> 00:32:39,353
There's nothing wrong with that.

440
00:32:39,695 --> 00:32:41,901
Daddy, this is ridiculous!

441
00:32:42,239 --> 00:32:43,520
- Go on, Daddy.
- Excuse me.

442
00:32:43,866 --> 00:32:44,612
Supposedly...

443
00:32:45,868 --> 00:32:48,738
...their mundane fears
and worries...

444
00:32:49,079 --> 00:32:50,657
...have been eliminated.

445
00:32:50,998 --> 00:32:54,034
They lose their motivation
and their reason...

446
00:32:55,294 --> 00:32:58,829
...to improve things because
their lives are already perfect.

447
00:32:59,965 --> 00:33:02,717
Dr. Harper says they often retreat...

448
00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:05,003
...into a childlike state.

449
00:33:07,056 --> 00:33:09,808
It's probably a desperate attempt...

450
00:33:10,726 --> 00:33:12,518
...to regain some of the...

451
00:33:14,897 --> 00:33:15,893
The what?

452
00:33:18,567 --> 00:33:19,516
The mystery.

453
00:33:22,071 --> 00:33:24,147
Dr. T, we have...

454
00:33:24,490 --> 00:33:26,068
Give us a couple minutes.

455
00:33:26,409 --> 00:33:28,117
Oh, of course I will.

456
00:33:34,458 --> 00:33:35,490
This doesn't make sense.

457
00:33:35,835 --> 00:33:40,711
I gotta go to cheerleading practice
and if I'm late, I swear to God...

458
00:33:41,674 --> 00:33:45,043
I love you. Everything will
be fine. Don't look so depressed.

459
00:33:46,679 --> 00:33:47,675
I love you.

460
00:33:48,014 --> 00:33:50,256
I'll see you later.
You'd better...

461
00:33:50,558 --> 00:33:53,263
...Altoid... mint... there.

462
00:33:54,479 --> 00:33:55,677
Bye, y'all.

463
00:33:56,814 --> 00:33:59,021
I got the Fourth of July
pictures out...

464
00:33:59,358 --> 00:34:03,522
...and I was thinking it might
be nice to give them to Kate.

465
00:34:04,155 --> 00:34:07,072
I don't know.
I'll ask Dr. Harper about it.

466
00:34:07,408 --> 00:34:10,777
I'm just so worried. Especially
if they have her on medication...

467
00:34:11,245 --> 00:34:13,452
I hate this even more than you do...

468
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:16,791
...but we have to trust the doctor.
- My butt looks huge!

469
00:34:17,126 --> 00:34:18,122
It's disgusting.

470
00:34:18,461 --> 00:34:21,213
What did you do?
Don't tear my family pictures!

471
00:34:21,547 --> 00:34:23,457
Give me the other half.

472
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:27,299
- I wouldn't photograph your butt.
- They are my family photos.

473
00:34:27,637 --> 00:34:30,508
I've got patients lined up out there
right now, so...

474
00:34:30,807 --> 00:34:34,092
We're sorry we're taking up
all your time.

475
00:34:34,435 --> 00:34:36,973
You give me some good sugar.

476
00:34:38,106 --> 00:34:40,145
- Love you too.
- Love you more.

477
00:34:40,483 --> 00:34:42,606
Have a good day. See you at home.

478
00:34:46,698 --> 00:34:47,647
Hey, handsome.

479
00:34:48,741 --> 00:34:49,690
What do we got?

480
00:34:50,034 --> 00:34:51,114
You all ready?

481
00:34:51,786 --> 00:34:57,077
Hildy is in Governor Ann Richards,
and she's got another bad infection.

482
00:34:57,417 --> 00:35:01,794
In Phyllis George we have Dorothy
Chamblis again for another exam...

483
00:35:02,088 --> 00:35:03,880
I know. Just go in there and...

484
00:35:04,215 --> 00:35:05,758
Yeah, yeah, yeah. What's next?

485
00:35:06,092 --> 00:35:08,548
And the new patient
I put in Belle Starr.

486
00:35:10,263 --> 00:35:12,588
- So there you go.
- Thank you, Carolyn.

487
00:35:16,186 --> 00:35:18,013
Hey, you need something?

488
00:35:20,232 --> 00:35:21,774
No, I'll be right there.

489
00:35:30,909 --> 00:35:34,112
Okay, ladies.
Listen up before we start practice.

490
00:35:34,454 --> 00:35:36,198
We've got good news and bad news.

491
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:40,158
Rhonda's injury will keep her out
for the rest of the season.

492
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:43,462
The good news is,
we have a replacement.

493
00:35:43,797 --> 00:35:45,671
This is Dee Dee Travis, everybody.

494
00:35:46,007 --> 00:35:48,130
Dee Dee's an alternate
we had from auditions.

495
00:35:48,427 --> 00:35:49,589
Welcome, Dee Dee.

496
00:35:50,053 --> 00:35:51,429
So y'all ready?

497
00:35:51,763 --> 00:35:55,132
Let's hit our first position
so we can fit Dee Dee in.

498
00:35:55,475 --> 00:35:57,053
We're gonna make a few changes.

499
00:35:57,394 --> 00:36:01,308
Alice, take Rhonda's position.
We'll put Dee Dee in your spot.

500
00:36:01,606 --> 00:36:04,773
- Yes, ma'am.
- That's right here behind Megan.

501
00:36:05,068 --> 00:36:07,144
Help her if she does
something wrong...

502
00:36:07,487 --> 00:36:10,903
...because she doesn't know
this choreography very well yet.

503
00:36:11,199 --> 00:36:14,366
What foot... Excuse me, ma'am,
what foot do you start on?

504
00:36:14,703 --> 00:36:15,485
Right foot.

505
00:36:15,829 --> 00:36:17,905
Tap your right foot, Dee Dee,
to start.

506
00:36:18,248 --> 00:36:19,873
Five, six, seven, eight. Go.

507
00:36:20,209 --> 00:36:24,253
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, stop.

508
00:36:24,588 --> 00:36:28,289
Dee Dee, on five you need to look
over to the right. Five...

509
00:36:28,592 --> 00:36:31,463
Right behind me, we have
the famous sixth floor window...

510
00:36:31,804 --> 00:36:35,588
...where Oswald supposedly shot JFK.

511
00:36:35,891 --> 00:36:37,931
So you're telling me
Oswald didn't do it?

512
00:36:38,268 --> 00:36:40,842
Well, there's many
conspiracy theories on that.

513
00:36:41,188 --> 00:36:43,346
You'll have to decide
which one you believe.

514
00:36:43,691 --> 00:36:45,185
What kind of a rifle did he use?

515
00:36:45,484 --> 00:36:49,316
Well, the Warren Commission says,
in their exhibit number 139...

516
00:36:49,613 --> 00:36:52,484
One and two, three, four, five...

517
00:36:52,825 --> 00:36:54,105
...and seven and...

518
00:36:54,410 --> 00:36:58,324
...one, two, look three, down four,
and shimmy, shimmy, up, up...

519
00:36:58,664 --> 00:37:01,997
...travel two, and three,
and four, and down.

520
00:37:02,334 --> 00:37:05,205
That's okay.
Take about a five-minute break.

521
00:37:05,504 --> 00:37:10,000
Let me see Group 1.
Put your pom-pons down.

522
00:37:10,426 --> 00:37:11,588
Okay, ready?

523
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:16,553
I have to make a call.
Will you cover for me?

524
00:37:20,311 --> 00:37:23,146
So Oswald supposedly used
this 23-year-old...

525
00:37:23,481 --> 00:37:26,684
...antiquated Army surplus rifle...

526
00:37:28,694 --> 00:37:31,612
...to fire at the president
from sixth-floor window.

527
00:37:31,947 --> 00:37:35,067
Which leads us right there,
guys, to the X.

528
00:37:35,701 --> 00:37:40,031
That's where JFK's head exploded!

529
00:37:40,373 --> 00:37:41,701
Excuse me for a second.

530
00:37:43,751 --> 00:37:45,459
I forgot to tell you something.

531
00:37:45,753 --> 00:37:46,868
I can't hear you.

532
00:37:47,171 --> 00:37:49,045
It's loud, but I can't talk loud.

533
00:37:49,382 --> 00:37:51,540
Is this important? I'm doing my tour.

534
00:37:51,884 --> 00:37:54,209
Connie, it's about my bridesmaids.

535
00:37:55,179 --> 00:37:56,673
What about the bridesmaids?

536
00:37:56,973 --> 00:38:00,057
Well, I finally decided who
my maid of honour will be.

537
00:38:02,270 --> 00:38:04,143
- Who did you choose?
- Marilyn.

538
00:38:04,522 --> 00:38:06,930
Come on, Dee Dee.
That snotty cheerleader?

539
00:38:07,233 --> 00:38:09,938
No, Marilyn from Houston.

540
00:38:10,862 --> 00:38:13,234
Oh, Dee Dee. Not Marilyn.

541
00:38:14,198 --> 00:38:17,152
Dee Dee, are you sure
you thought this through?

542
00:38:17,493 --> 00:38:21,325
I'm positive. I talked
to her last night, and she's pumped.

543
00:38:21,622 --> 00:38:23,330
She's coming up
for the get-together.

544
00:38:23,666 --> 00:38:26,074
I don't think
it's a good idea, Dee Dee.

545
00:38:26,794 --> 00:38:30,080
There we go. All right.
Easy, easy.

546
00:38:30,423 --> 00:38:33,626
Right there. You feel a lump, right?

547
00:38:33,926 --> 00:38:35,919
That's normal. That's fine.

548
00:38:39,766 --> 00:38:41,176
Normal. Normal.

549
00:38:41,476 --> 00:38:42,425
Dorothy...

550
00:38:43,061 --> 00:38:44,436
...you are a specimen.

551
00:38:44,854 --> 00:38:48,804
The picture of health.
Nothing to worry about whatsoever.

552
00:38:49,442 --> 00:38:51,150
You're absolutely perfect.

553
00:38:54,239 --> 00:38:56,362
Are you sure, Dr. T?

554
00:38:56,699 --> 00:38:59,404
I've been feeling kind of funny
the past couple days.

555
00:38:59,744 --> 00:39:03,658
No, no, positive.
No, everything looks great.

556
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:06,080
You look absolutely fantastic,
actually.

557
00:39:06,668 --> 00:39:08,376
You look wonderful.
Just great.

558
00:39:08,711 --> 00:39:10,538
Does anyone tell you that lately?

559
00:39:11,548 --> 00:39:13,671
- No.
- No?

560
00:39:15,927 --> 00:39:17,421
Well, yes.

561
00:39:17,762 --> 00:39:20,549
You and...

562
00:39:22,726 --> 00:39:24,101
...your nurse...

563
00:39:27,188 --> 00:39:31,601
...and your bookkeeper and your
receptionist, as a matter of fact.

564
00:39:31,901 --> 00:39:35,105
- All in the last ten minutes.
- Then it must be true.

565
00:39:36,489 --> 00:39:40,155
But they told me the same thing
when I was here two weeks ago.

566
00:39:40,952 --> 00:39:44,736
And the time before that.
In fact, they always say that.

567
00:39:46,333 --> 00:39:48,705
Dr. T? Sorry.
Barbara Lloyd's in labour.

568
00:39:49,002 --> 00:39:51,410
Her husband called.
They're on their way to the hospital.

569
00:39:52,297 --> 00:39:53,756
You can get dressed now.

570
00:39:54,508 --> 00:39:56,132
Tell them I'm on my way too.

571
00:39:57,427 --> 00:39:59,135
- That's it?
- That's it.

572
00:40:08,021 --> 00:40:09,184
I'm sorry, gotta go.

573
00:40:09,523 --> 00:40:11,017
Delivering a baby. Twins.

574
00:40:11,316 --> 00:40:12,597
We can cancel the rest.

575
00:40:12,943 --> 00:40:16,228
Man, I have been here
for an hour and a half...

576
00:40:17,030 --> 00:40:18,572
Ladies, thank you. I'm sorry.

577
00:40:18,907 --> 00:40:22,074
- Judy, take care of them soon.
- All right, Dr. T.

578
00:40:22,452 --> 00:40:25,453
I've got a load of messages here.
Are you coming back?

579
00:40:25,789 --> 00:40:27,449
- Doubtful.
- Call me anyway.

580
00:40:40,721 --> 00:40:44,090
- Samples. I get them for free.
- Do I get them for free?

581
00:40:44,433 --> 00:40:47,434
Duck season opens next week.
Why don't we get some?

582
00:40:47,770 --> 00:40:50,011
- I'm in. I'm in.
- All right.

583
00:41:20,678 --> 00:41:22,754
Oh, my God!

584
00:41:23,681 --> 00:41:26,088
- Hello there.
- Hey, Bree.

585
00:41:27,268 --> 00:41:30,055
- Here's a dry one.
- Thank you very much.

586
00:41:32,106 --> 00:41:33,600
Oh, my God.

587
00:41:36,694 --> 00:41:41,023
- You always that good?
- Well, when it matters I seem to be.

588
00:41:41,365 --> 00:41:43,192
Which is all the time, right?

589
00:41:44,535 --> 00:41:46,658
Harlan told me you play on the tour.

590
00:41:46,996 --> 00:41:49,285
Yeah, almost ten years now.

591
00:41:49,623 --> 00:41:52,827
- Are you off-season now?
- No, just taking some time off.

592
00:41:53,169 --> 00:41:54,711
Sort of indefinitely.

593
00:41:55,046 --> 00:41:57,715
If I'm gonna get nine holes in today,
I better go.

594
00:41:58,049 --> 00:41:59,294
- You got a partner?
- No.

595
00:41:59,633 --> 00:42:00,914
You want one?

596
00:42:01,594 --> 00:42:03,883
- Well, your cart or mine?
- Mine's dry.

597
00:42:04,221 --> 00:42:06,973
- Let's take yours.
- All right.

598
00:42:07,683 --> 00:42:10,933
No, I got it. I got it.

599
00:42:16,692 --> 00:42:17,688
- You got it?
- Yep.

600
00:42:18,819 --> 00:42:20,729
Oh, my God.

601
00:42:25,034 --> 00:42:27,323
- Nice shoes.
- Oh, thank you.

602
00:42:32,667 --> 00:42:33,865
Shall we go?

603
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:38,046
Yeah.

604
00:43:03,656 --> 00:43:08,698
Group 3 will be going to Washington
DC to visit the White House.

605
00:43:09,454 --> 00:43:11,114
Anyone on the alternate status...

606
00:43:11,456 --> 00:43:14,741
...will be doing the performance
at the Huntsville Prison Rodeo.

607
00:43:15,752 --> 00:43:19,584
Of course, we have two football
games in the next couple weeks.

608
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:24,635
- Whose phone is that?
- It's not mine.

609
00:43:24,928 --> 00:43:27,051
It's gotta be somebody's phone.
Whose is it?

610
00:43:28,598 --> 00:43:31,006
You know, it's probably mine.

611
00:43:32,936 --> 00:43:34,134
I think I left it on.

612
00:43:35,522 --> 00:43:38,095
I'll just be right over here.

613
00:43:40,568 --> 00:43:41,731
It's an emergency.

614
00:43:42,028 --> 00:43:44,650
Take your emergency
to the locker room.

615
00:43:44,948 --> 00:43:46,442
Yes, ma'am.

616
00:43:47,450 --> 00:43:48,482
Now, where was I?

617
00:43:48,785 --> 00:43:51,074
Dee Dee, it's Connie.
Listen, I've only got a second.

618
00:43:51,413 --> 00:43:53,820
The Zapruder film starts soon
so don't interrupt me.

619
00:43:54,124 --> 00:43:55,535
Girl, what do you want?

620
00:43:55,875 --> 00:43:58,627
We need to talk about
this Marilyn situation.

621
00:43:59,087 --> 00:44:03,583
Has it ever occurred to you that
she has something else up her sleeve?

622
00:44:03,925 --> 00:44:06,251
Besides being your maid of honour?

623
00:44:06,553 --> 00:44:09,756
This is really a bad time.
I have to go.

624
00:44:10,390 --> 00:44:13,142
You know what? Something else
just occurred to me.

625
00:44:13,810 --> 00:44:15,554
The wedding shouldn't be outdoors.

626
00:44:15,896 --> 00:44:17,094
Why not?

627
00:44:17,439 --> 00:44:20,974
Because this is Texas, you know.
You can't count on the weather.

628
00:44:21,318 --> 00:44:24,023
Fall is the most beautiful
time of year in Texas.

629
00:44:24,362 --> 00:44:27,981
It'll be beautiful out by the lake.
I'm willing to take that chance.

630
00:44:28,283 --> 00:44:30,157
Dee Dee, listen.

631
00:44:30,494 --> 00:44:34,408
Fall storms are like snipers, and
they hit you when you least expect.

632
00:44:38,961 --> 00:44:44,002
So you've been in the top 25
for the last four years.

633
00:44:44,383 --> 00:44:45,663
What made you walk away?

634
00:44:46,009 --> 00:44:48,796
Nobody believes me when I say this...

635
00:44:49,096 --> 00:44:51,302
...but I just stopped having fun.

636
00:44:51,682 --> 00:44:53,508
It became about something else.

637
00:44:53,809 --> 00:44:56,929
It became about not losing
instead of winning.

638
00:44:57,229 --> 00:45:00,894
It became about relief instead of joy.

639
00:45:01,441 --> 00:45:03,600
It became about the game
instead of me.

640
00:45:03,902 --> 00:45:05,100
Well, I believe you.

641
00:45:06,488 --> 00:45:08,196
- You do?
- Yes, I do.

642
00:45:17,166 --> 00:45:19,158
- Pass some more dough, Amber.
- That's good!

643
00:45:20,252 --> 00:45:23,206
I think the phone is ringing.
Where's the phone, Maria?

644
00:45:23,505 --> 00:45:27,170
- It should be here.
- I don't have enough dough.

645
00:45:27,468 --> 00:45:28,748
- Where is it?
- Hello?

646
00:45:29,053 --> 00:45:32,920
Hi, Amber!
Hey, it's your cousin Deeds.

647
00:45:33,265 --> 00:45:34,214
Hi, Aunt Peggy.

648
00:45:34,516 --> 00:45:38,466
Hey, honey! Hi.
We're baking away here.

649
00:45:38,812 --> 00:45:41,101
So you'll have treats
when you get home.

650
00:45:41,523 --> 00:45:44,477
Looks like I'm packing up
to go to Huntsville.

651
00:45:44,777 --> 00:45:47,813
- Lf I even make it to next week.
- What do you mean, sweetie?

652
00:45:48,155 --> 00:45:52,532
Well, I left my cell phone on
during rehearsal.

653
00:45:52,868 --> 00:45:55,110
It just kept ringing and ringing.

654
00:45:57,123 --> 00:46:01,416
And rumour has it I'm gonna
be on the wait-warning list.

655
00:46:01,752 --> 00:46:05,750
Wait, what do you mean?
I really think it's crazy, you know?

656
00:46:06,090 --> 00:46:09,506
I mean, your body's so cute and...

657
00:46:09,844 --> 00:46:12,679
Everybody will try to make you
something you're not.

658
00:46:12,972 --> 00:46:15,048
Or already are
and they don't see it...

659
00:46:15,349 --> 00:46:20,142
...or have some ridiculous concept
or idea of a body from a magazine.

660
00:46:20,479 --> 00:46:22,555
At least the prisoners won't mind.

661
00:46:22,898 --> 00:46:26,647
Listen, Aunt Peg, Connie called
me just a little while ago.

662
00:46:27,153 --> 00:46:30,070
She's trying to talk me out
of having an outdoor wedding.

663
00:46:30,406 --> 00:46:32,315
That's what you want, isn't it?

664
00:46:32,617 --> 00:46:36,401
I really, really want to have
my wedding out by the lake.

665
00:46:36,746 --> 00:46:38,785
It's really important to me,
and it is my wedding.

666
00:46:39,081 --> 00:46:41,323
- It is your wedding.
- Connie's so stubborn.

667
00:46:41,667 --> 00:46:43,541
It's not her wedding.
She'll have a wedding.

668
00:46:43,878 --> 00:46:47,710
One day, you'll start telling her
how she should have her wedding.

669
00:46:48,007 --> 00:46:51,091
I just want your support
if it comes up again.

670
00:46:51,385 --> 00:46:53,508
Well, that is what I'm here for.

671
00:46:53,805 --> 00:46:55,382
Aunts and grandmas, right?

672
00:46:55,723 --> 00:46:59,803
The unconditional love, hopefully.
That's what I want to give y'all.

673
00:47:00,144 --> 00:47:05,102
That you know, I mean, I will support
you 100 trillion-billion percent.

674
00:47:05,942 --> 00:47:09,145
Dee Dee, can I see you
in my office please?

675
00:47:09,487 --> 00:47:12,690
- Right now, ma'am?
- Yeah, it'll just take a minute.

676
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:14,980
Yes, ma'am.

677
00:47:16,577 --> 00:47:18,120
I'll call you later.

678
00:47:18,621 --> 00:47:20,413
Shoot.

679
00:47:23,835 --> 00:47:25,210
- Good luck.
- Bye, Dee Dee.

680
00:47:26,296 --> 00:47:29,499
You deliver babies.
My God, what a thing!

681
00:47:29,841 --> 00:47:31,999
Being there for a person's
first breath!

682
00:47:32,343 --> 00:47:33,257
Yeah, it's awesome.

683
00:47:33,595 --> 00:47:36,845
You know, I delivered twin girls
a couple of hours ago.

684
00:47:37,223 --> 00:47:39,015
One was right on top of the other.

685
00:47:39,350 --> 00:47:42,351
It was touch-and-go which one
was gonna come out first.

686
00:47:42,687 --> 00:47:45,059
That is exciting. Yeah.

687
00:47:46,107 --> 00:47:47,518
You know, I've delivered...

688
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:51,689
Oh, God, I don't know,
22 sets of twins.

689
00:47:51,988 --> 00:47:53,067
Yeah, 22.

690
00:47:53,364 --> 00:47:57,314
One thing I've noticed is that
if at least one of them is a boy...

691
00:47:57,660 --> 00:48:00,068
...there's an order
about how they arrive.

692
00:48:00,413 --> 00:48:02,869
Like they made a game plan
ahead of time.

693
00:48:03,166 --> 00:48:08,208
One sits there waiting patiently
while the other one's born.

694
00:48:08,588 --> 00:48:11,506
But invariably, if both
are female, forget it.

695
00:48:12,259 --> 00:48:14,631
It's one big race to the finish line.

696
00:48:21,101 --> 00:48:22,263
- Nice shot.
- Thank you.

697
00:48:22,602 --> 00:48:24,891
- What do you think that means?
- I don't know.

698
00:48:25,230 --> 00:48:27,982
I got it, I got it, I got it.
Thank you.

699
00:48:28,316 --> 00:48:31,520
- I'm not a twin. I don't have sisters.
- No sisters?

700
00:48:31,903 --> 00:48:34,441
- Any brothers?
- Three.

701
00:48:35,740 --> 00:48:37,650
- Do you have kids?
- Two daughters.

702
00:48:38,118 --> 00:48:42,579
- Well, that must be fun.
- Yeah, most of the time.

703
00:48:43,373 --> 00:48:46,125
Both of them are a little nuts
right now.

704
00:48:49,212 --> 00:48:52,795
One's getting married
and the other's kind of jealous.

705
00:48:53,175 --> 00:48:54,170
You're driving?

706
00:48:59,097 --> 00:49:02,383
Yeah, I think they both miss
their mother right now too.

707
00:49:05,729 --> 00:49:07,389
So how's your wife doing?

708
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:09,887
Not so good.

709
00:49:11,193 --> 00:49:12,391
She's...

710
00:49:15,906 --> 00:49:17,614
Been a long time.

711
00:49:22,037 --> 00:49:24,113
Look how good they turned out!

712
00:49:24,414 --> 00:49:27,036
Your hearts, how pretty.

713
00:49:27,376 --> 00:49:29,783
- Isn't that good?
- Yeah.

714
00:49:30,087 --> 00:49:31,996
You did so good.

715
00:49:33,799 --> 00:49:35,673
Thank you. Hello?

716
00:49:35,968 --> 00:49:36,833
Thank you, ma'am.

717
00:49:37,177 --> 00:49:41,009
- Listen, it's Connie.
- Hey, honey. How are you?

718
00:49:41,348 --> 00:49:43,804
I just talked to Dee Dee
a little bit ago.

719
00:49:44,143 --> 00:49:47,428
She's continuing to insist
on this outdoor wedding idea...

720
00:49:47,730 --> 00:49:50,055
...which I just think
is just completely insane.

721
00:49:50,399 --> 00:49:54,017
Not to mention dangerous
for all of us.

722
00:49:54,361 --> 00:49:55,986
Why do you think so?

723
00:49:56,322 --> 00:49:58,279
Peggy, I just know it's gonna rain.

724
00:49:58,616 --> 00:50:02,779
That means it'll be a huge
problem for everyone in the family.

725
00:50:03,078 --> 00:50:07,787
It's not necessary. We're better off
having it indoors where it's safe.

726
00:50:08,125 --> 00:50:09,370
She's gonna call you.

727
00:50:09,710 --> 00:50:12,248
I need you to convince her
to have it indoors.

728
00:50:12,546 --> 00:50:15,583
- It might be better.
- It'll be a huge problem for us.

729
00:50:15,925 --> 00:50:17,917
- We won't want to deal with it.
- Indoors.

730
00:50:18,385 --> 00:50:20,212
I'm right on this one. Trust me.

731
00:50:20,554 --> 00:50:22,262
I think you're right.

732
00:50:22,598 --> 00:50:25,219
So I need you to be on my side, okay?

733
00:50:25,559 --> 00:50:27,303
We all have to go indoors.

734
00:50:27,645 --> 00:50:30,681
- You promise?
- Inside. Turn, turn inside.

735
00:50:30,981 --> 00:50:32,310
- Thanks, Peggy.
- Turn within.

736
00:50:32,608 --> 00:50:35,609
All right. I'll talk to you later.
Okay, bye.

737
00:50:38,698 --> 00:50:41,023
Can I have some milk with my cookies?

738
00:50:45,788 --> 00:50:47,662
Oh, shoot!

739
00:50:50,251 --> 00:50:51,366
You're amazing, Bree.

740
00:50:51,711 --> 00:50:55,660
I have never seen a woman like you.
I got it.

741
00:50:56,382 --> 00:50:57,331
Really?

742
00:50:58,175 --> 00:50:59,456
- Never?
- Never.

743
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:02,548
Let me ask you something.
You see women all day, every day.

744
00:51:02,889 --> 00:51:05,427
How do they keep
from just running together?

745
00:51:05,725 --> 00:51:09,224
I think every single woman
I have ever met...

746
00:51:09,562 --> 00:51:11,270
...got something special about her.

747
00:51:11,564 --> 00:51:14,399
Something that sets her apart
from the rest.

748
00:51:16,527 --> 00:51:19,979
Well, if a gynaecologist says
there's no two alike...

749
00:51:20,281 --> 00:51:22,523
...I guess there's no two alike.

750
00:51:31,709 --> 00:51:33,951
Maria? No, thank you.

751
00:51:34,253 --> 00:51:36,412
- Has Marilyn called?
- Not yet.

752
00:51:36,756 --> 00:51:38,630
Hello! Hi, sweetie.

753
00:51:38,967 --> 00:51:40,342
- How are you?
- Good, come on in.

754
00:51:40,677 --> 00:51:43,132
- Hi! Good to see you.
- Good to see you too.

755
00:51:43,721 --> 00:51:45,216
Who's this from?

756
00:51:45,557 --> 00:51:46,505
There's no card.

757
00:51:46,849 --> 00:51:48,094
Who's this from?

758
00:51:48,393 --> 00:51:49,851
- Dee Dee?
- Yeah.

759
00:51:50,186 --> 00:51:52,013
- Look at that.
- That is...

760
00:51:52,355 --> 00:51:54,063
Let's go in the other room.

761
00:51:55,942 --> 00:51:56,689
Maria?

762
00:51:56,985 --> 00:52:01,113
Maria, could you wrap this stuff for
me, please? It's getting cluttered.

763
00:52:04,701 --> 00:52:06,693
I think you should wear this.

764
00:52:07,036 --> 00:52:09,990
Oh, my God! Honey, when is it due?

765
00:52:12,709 --> 00:52:16,327
- I'm Marilyn.
- Oh, Marilyn, the maid of honour.

766
00:52:16,671 --> 00:52:20,005
Happy to meet you, I'm Peggy.
Let me get this door.

767
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:23,420
- Nice to meet you too. Champagne?
- No, I'm okay.

768
00:52:23,762 --> 00:52:26,134
- Well, can I take your coat?
- Sure.

769
00:52:30,435 --> 00:52:32,891
Nobody can know.

770
00:52:33,188 --> 00:52:35,264
She said you drove a long way.

771
00:52:35,607 --> 00:52:38,145
- Look who's here.
- Hi, sweetheart!

772
00:52:40,904 --> 00:52:43,442
I've been waiting for you.

773
00:52:43,782 --> 00:52:46,237
You look so beautiful.
You're so precious.

774
00:52:46,576 --> 00:52:48,616
Champagne to offer to her.

775
00:52:48,912 --> 00:52:50,786
You know, it might be nice...

776
00:52:52,707 --> 00:52:55,708
...to open presents, and maybe
Marilyn would like...

777
00:52:56,002 --> 00:52:58,838
Everybody, this is Marilyn.

778
00:52:59,172 --> 00:53:01,165
Maid of honour!

779
00:53:01,508 --> 00:53:04,081
Everybody over here, this is Marilyn.

780
00:53:05,262 --> 00:53:06,341
This is Marilyn.

781
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:08,471
She's having a little breakdown now.

782
00:53:08,807 --> 00:53:12,057
Everybody knows that it will be fine.

783
00:53:13,145 --> 00:53:15,766
Could somebody give Marilyn a chair?

784
00:53:16,231 --> 00:53:18,390
Can you get her a chair, please?

785
00:53:18,734 --> 00:53:22,268
- Marilyn needs a chair.
- That's not my problem.

786
00:53:27,451 --> 00:53:28,862
So how was the trip?

787
00:53:30,537 --> 00:53:31,486
How are you doing?

788
00:53:32,289 --> 00:53:34,614
This is from your mother.

789
00:53:34,958 --> 00:53:37,200
All her love in the world.

790
00:53:38,545 --> 00:53:39,292
Cheese.

791
00:53:42,508 --> 00:53:45,081
Sorry, you all right?
Okay, come and sit down.

792
00:53:45,886 --> 00:53:50,465
I got two weeks' worth of estrogen
and progesterone.

793
00:53:50,808 --> 00:53:53,180
And one tablet.

794
00:53:53,519 --> 00:53:55,558
The hot flashes should go
away immediately.

795
00:53:55,854 --> 00:53:57,847
It'll be good for your
mood swings too.

796
00:53:58,148 --> 00:54:01,434
Now remember, please call me.

797
00:54:01,985 --> 00:54:05,355
Anytime there's anything you
want to talk about. Okay?

798
00:54:05,698 --> 00:54:07,524
- Sure.
- I'm always here for you.

799
00:54:13,664 --> 00:54:15,288
Thanks.

800
00:54:19,837 --> 00:54:24,298
You know, Christine, I
try to tell all my patients...

801
00:54:24,633 --> 00:54:27,718
...that menopause is no different
than going through puberty.

802
00:54:30,055 --> 00:54:34,349
Your body's changing.
Your hormones are all over the place.

803
00:54:34,643 --> 00:54:39,352
You're so much more sensitive
and emotional than you normally are.

804
00:54:39,690 --> 00:54:42,477
You're not sure what's happening,
but I promise you...

805
00:54:42,818 --> 00:54:46,602
...if you don't let it scare you,
if you don't get upset...

806
00:54:46,947 --> 00:54:50,233
...if you could just somehow
embrace this thing...

807
00:54:50,576 --> 00:54:54,408
...you're gonna find
a renewed sexiness.

808
00:54:54,747 --> 00:54:57,701
A womanliness that you've probably
never felt before.

809
00:54:59,335 --> 00:55:02,953
- Hello, Dr. Tra...
- Whatever. I've been here for an hour.

810
00:55:03,297 --> 00:55:04,578
Bree?

811
00:55:04,924 --> 00:55:09,965
It's just my opinion, but nothing's
more appealing than a woman...

812
00:55:10,388 --> 00:55:12,546
...who's proud to be in her own body.

813
00:55:12,890 --> 00:55:17,848
And believe me, there is nothing...

814
00:55:19,772 --> 00:55:22,524
Marsha, there's no charge
for this visit.

815
00:55:22,817 --> 00:55:24,774
Just call it a free follow-up.

816
00:55:25,069 --> 00:55:26,018
On the house.

817
00:55:26,362 --> 00:55:31,404
You know what? I'll be the best
damn menopause patient you ever had.

818
00:55:32,660 --> 00:55:33,609
That's a promise!

819
00:55:33,953 --> 00:55:37,404
Go, girl! You go, girl!

820
00:55:37,832 --> 00:55:39,410
You want something?

821
00:55:39,709 --> 00:55:43,374
Oh, the phone. On the phone, Bree.
Very pushy.

822
00:55:43,713 --> 00:55:44,792
Want me to handle it?

823
00:55:45,089 --> 00:55:47,461
Why didn't you tell me?
What line is she on?

824
00:55:49,594 --> 00:55:50,922
It's line four!

825
00:55:51,262 --> 00:55:52,922
- Four?
- Four.

826
00:55:54,140 --> 00:55:55,385
- Hey.
- Hey!

827
00:55:55,725 --> 00:55:57,931
It's quite a surprise.

828
00:55:58,269 --> 00:56:01,555
- What's up?
- We got in those steel drivers today.

829
00:56:02,190 --> 00:56:03,186
Did you try one?

830
00:56:03,483 --> 00:56:05,725
You'll hit the ball
10 yards farther.

831
00:56:06,069 --> 00:56:08,560
I'd better go over there
or they'll all be gone.

832
00:56:08,905 --> 00:56:11,360
You gonna be there at 5:30?

833
00:56:11,699 --> 00:56:13,858
Yeah, I get off at 5:00,
then I'm going for a swim.

834
00:56:14,202 --> 00:56:15,233
You'll wait for me?

835
00:56:15,578 --> 00:56:17,867
- Sure.
- Great!

836
00:56:20,166 --> 00:56:21,958
Yeah, I'll...

837
00:56:23,461 --> 00:56:25,205
- I'll see you.
- I'll see you then.

838
00:56:25,547 --> 00:56:29,081
- I'll see you then.
- Okay, bye.

839
00:56:41,604 --> 00:56:42,600
Look at you!

840
00:56:42,939 --> 00:56:45,513
Not bad. It's got a lot
of whip to it.

841
00:56:46,276 --> 00:56:49,360
- I got it.
- It's my job. You hit the ball.

842
00:56:52,574 --> 00:56:54,282
Step up there.

843
00:56:59,206 --> 00:57:01,282
You're really gonna do this?
Okay, go ahead.

844
00:57:01,625 --> 00:57:02,656
That's great.

845
00:57:03,001 --> 00:57:05,243
Put your hands ahead that much.

846
00:57:07,589 --> 00:57:09,795
- I feel a little close to it.
- You're fine.

847
00:57:17,349 --> 00:57:18,926
Damn. Thank you.

848
00:57:20,102 --> 00:57:22,806
Does that club feel like
butter in your hands?

849
00:57:23,814 --> 00:57:26,518
Yeah, just exactly like butter.
It's...

850
00:57:26,858 --> 00:57:30,025
- Funny, I'm really sweating today.
- It's okay, it happens.

851
00:57:30,904 --> 00:57:32,648
What do you do when that happens?

852
00:57:33,740 --> 00:57:36,314
I used to panic and think,
"Concentrate harder."

853
00:57:36,660 --> 00:57:39,329
Now I forget it and wrap them
around a beer.

854
00:57:41,707 --> 00:57:43,580
So you want to get a beer?

855
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:47,951
Well...

856
00:57:48,297 --> 00:57:50,123
Or maybe dinner?

857
00:57:50,507 --> 00:57:53,591
There's a terrific steak house
out in Belline.

858
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:56,878
- All right, let's do it.
- Yeah?

859
00:57:57,973 --> 00:57:59,301
Dinner.

860
00:58:01,977 --> 00:58:04,219
Only, I know a better place.

861
00:58:05,981 --> 00:58:07,475
This is amazing.

862
00:58:08,650 --> 00:58:12,399
I haven't seen anything like this
since the jungle ride at Disneyland.

863
00:58:12,738 --> 00:58:16,486
There's a thousand of these in Dallas,
$750 a month.

864
00:58:16,825 --> 00:58:19,399
If the fountain keeps you awake,
they give you free earplugs.

865
00:58:19,745 --> 00:58:22,948
- You have earplugs?
- I have a set of first-time earplugs.

866
00:58:26,293 --> 00:58:28,120
This is it.

867
00:58:28,921 --> 00:58:32,005
- Oh, it's nice.
- Thank you.

868
00:58:32,383 --> 00:58:33,545
It really is nice.

869
00:58:33,842 --> 00:58:34,838
See?

870
00:58:35,177 --> 00:58:36,885
You want to put those right there?

871
00:58:37,221 --> 00:58:38,881
All right, I will.

872
00:58:44,436 --> 00:58:46,096
Here, give me your jacket.

873
00:58:46,438 --> 00:58:48,396
All right.

874
00:58:48,816 --> 00:58:49,895
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

875
00:58:57,074 --> 00:58:58,901
Shall I open a bottle of wine?

876
00:58:59,243 --> 00:59:01,699
- Yeah, do that.
- All right.

877
00:59:20,181 --> 00:59:21,177
You got it?

878
00:59:24,185 --> 00:59:26,723
That's good. Glasses here?

879
00:59:27,021 --> 00:59:27,803
Right there. You know what?

880
00:59:28,147 --> 00:59:30,899
Why don't you light some candles?
You can use that.

881
00:59:32,026 --> 00:59:34,066
- You'll pour wine?
- I'll pour wine.

882
00:59:53,089 --> 00:59:54,998
You trust me to do this?

883
00:59:55,341 --> 00:59:56,586
The first time.

884
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:24,532
- Looks good.
- I hope so.

885
01:00:32,795 --> 01:00:34,503
There we go.

886
01:00:37,342 --> 01:00:38,884
There we go.

887
01:00:39,636 --> 01:00:41,178
That's nice.

888
01:00:44,390 --> 01:00:46,798
- Great, thanks.
- You're welcome.

889
01:00:51,106 --> 01:00:52,268
Cheers.

890
01:00:58,738 --> 01:01:01,525
Will you watch those and
check them in 7 minutes?

891
01:01:01,866 --> 01:01:02,898
I'll be here.

892
01:01:03,243 --> 01:01:05,781
I'll be right back.
I'm gonna change my clothes.

893
01:02:11,812 --> 01:02:12,843
You finished?

894
01:02:13,188 --> 01:02:16,806
- Yes, it was absolutely amazing.
- Good.

895
01:02:17,109 --> 01:02:18,354
Thank you.

896
01:02:50,225 --> 01:02:52,467
You want to close the screen
on the fire?

897
01:02:53,270 --> 01:02:54,301
Yeah.

898
01:04:21,567 --> 01:04:23,893
I saw Joanne a few days ago.

899
01:04:24,237 --> 01:04:26,360
- She seemed well, happy.
- Where'd you see her?

900
01:04:26,698 --> 01:04:30,778
She was at the city council's
planning commission meeting.

901
01:04:31,119 --> 01:04:32,661
You know about...

902
01:04:33,871 --> 01:04:36,872
...naming that new highway
after a woman.

903
01:04:37,208 --> 01:04:39,117
I did the presentation for her.

904
01:04:39,419 --> 01:04:42,088
Jesus, that's all she talks
about anymore.

905
01:04:42,380 --> 01:04:43,625
Thanks.

906
01:04:44,382 --> 01:04:46,505
She says if they get turned down...

907
01:04:46,801 --> 01:04:51,380
...they'll all chain themselves to
an overpass on the LBJ and protest.

908
01:04:51,681 --> 01:04:54,172
Women will do anything to
get their way.

909
01:04:54,517 --> 01:04:58,100
Well, not Dorothy.
She's afraid of heights, you know?

910
01:04:58,396 --> 01:05:00,804
Well, Dorothy's got her share
of fears, doesn't she?

911
01:05:01,149 --> 01:05:01,979
What do you mean?

912
01:05:02,317 --> 01:05:04,938
Oh, she stopped by the office
again last week.

913
01:05:05,236 --> 01:05:08,154
She's fine, no problem.
She's looking good.

914
01:05:08,490 --> 01:05:09,770
I told her she was looking good.

915
01:05:10,075 --> 01:05:12,447
- Got anything besides peanut butter?
- No.

916
01:05:12,744 --> 01:05:14,950
She had another appointment
with you last week?

917
01:05:15,288 --> 01:05:16,913
Yeah. You think she's looking good?

918
01:05:18,249 --> 01:05:19,115
Yeah.

919
01:05:19,626 --> 01:05:21,120
I like her new hairstyle.

920
01:05:23,088 --> 01:05:24,250
- Hairstyle?
- Yeah.

921
01:05:24,589 --> 01:05:29,584
The new kind of up thing
she's doing with her hair.

922
01:05:30,303 --> 01:05:32,177
Oh, you mean the hair on her head.

923
01:05:44,901 --> 01:05:46,858
The water's nice.

924
01:05:51,450 --> 01:05:52,196
No.

925
01:05:53,618 --> 01:05:55,694
- You cold?
- No, I'm okay.

926
01:05:56,037 --> 01:05:57,117
You cold?

927
01:05:57,414 --> 01:05:58,659
A little bit.

928
01:06:00,625 --> 01:06:03,710
If we sit here long enough, we'll
see the Lady of the Lake.

929
01:06:04,046 --> 01:06:05,077
Who's that?

930
01:06:05,422 --> 01:06:09,254
You don't know the Lady of the Lake?
It's a famous legend.

931
01:06:11,261 --> 01:06:15,555
This woman in this flowing,
white, exotic negligee...

932
01:06:17,643 --> 01:06:21,557
She drowned... I'm serious.
She drowned because of a broken heart.

933
01:06:21,897 --> 01:06:22,643
Really?

934
01:06:22,981 --> 01:06:26,231
She appears to couples
around the lake who are in love.

935
01:06:26,568 --> 01:06:28,976
And she either cries for help...

936
01:06:29,279 --> 01:06:33,822
...or she just cries this really
sad, mournful cry.

937
01:06:36,203 --> 01:06:40,248
I believe it. I mean,
people swear it's true.

938
01:06:40,791 --> 01:06:42,368
I believe it.

939
01:07:01,895 --> 01:07:04,221
So, Sully. How's Kate doing?

940
01:07:05,190 --> 01:07:09,058
Doing all right, I guess.
According to the doctors.

941
01:07:11,739 --> 01:07:13,862
You mean, they still haven't
let you see her?

942
01:07:15,659 --> 01:07:16,822
No.

943
01:07:18,203 --> 01:07:20,529
They say she needs more time.

944
01:07:22,333 --> 01:07:25,867
I don't know dick about psychology,
or women either for that matter...

945
01:07:26,212 --> 01:07:30,375
...but it just doesn't seem right,
them not letting you see her.

946
01:07:30,716 --> 01:07:33,124
She's your wife, for chrissake.

947
01:07:34,053 --> 01:07:37,636
I know. I know, I feel the same way,
but I'm trying to trust them.

948
01:07:37,932 --> 01:07:40,968
They say if I do it too soon...

949
01:07:41,268 --> 01:07:44,222
...it'll set her back even farther.

950
01:07:46,232 --> 01:07:47,642
Right there in our decoys.

951
01:07:51,362 --> 01:07:53,900
That wasn't in our decoys,
that was our decoy.

952
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:56,945
Shit! That's it.
Ready to go, Eli?

953
01:07:57,284 --> 01:07:59,989
- I swear there's feathers.
- I think we're going home now.

954
01:08:00,329 --> 01:08:02,452
It moved. Oh, shit.

955
01:08:17,388 --> 01:08:22,264
I'm Dr. Sully Travis. I'm here to
see Kate Travis, a patient of yours.

956
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:24,220
You're one of her doctors?

957
01:08:25,271 --> 01:08:26,267
Yes, I am.

958
01:08:26,606 --> 01:08:29,725
Is Dr. Harper expecting you today?

959
01:08:31,569 --> 01:08:33,229
No, no. She...

960
01:08:34,781 --> 01:08:38,944
I think she'd be fine with it
though, that I see Kate.

961
01:08:41,788 --> 01:08:43,365
I'm her husband.

962
01:08:44,916 --> 01:08:46,161
To be honest...

963
01:08:46,501 --> 01:08:50,961
...I can't face another day without
seeing her. I miss her so much.

964
01:08:56,094 --> 01:08:57,754
Look.

965
01:08:58,096 --> 01:08:59,590
It's sort of like Chagall, moody.

966
01:08:59,889 --> 01:09:02,974
This is the land, this is the sky.
What's that?

967
01:09:03,309 --> 01:09:05,218
The sun? Maybe a big marshmallow?

968
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:07,512
Look what I painted.

969
01:09:07,814 --> 01:09:10,269
No! Go away, we're playing a game.

970
01:09:11,234 --> 01:09:12,942
You keep doing that!

971
01:09:13,236 --> 01:09:14,896
Anyway, it's like Chagall.

972
01:09:15,238 --> 01:09:16,697
- Chagall?
- There's a storm.

973
01:09:17,031 --> 01:09:19,439
Where's the Chagall?
Where's the storm?

974
01:09:22,287 --> 01:09:23,567
Hi!

975
01:09:27,917 --> 01:09:29,827
Oh, God, you!

976
01:09:30,628 --> 01:09:33,202
Oh, you came!

977
01:09:33,882 --> 01:09:34,831
Oh, gosh.

978
01:09:35,133 --> 01:09:36,758
You look great.

979
01:09:37,927 --> 01:09:40,928
Look who came to see me.
Say hello to Ann, the cleaning girl.

980
01:09:41,222 --> 01:09:42,717
And Angie.

981
01:09:43,683 --> 01:09:46,221
Remember, I told you?
Well, this is...

982
01:09:46,519 --> 01:09:49,057
- Hello, I'm Alice.
- It's not Alice.

983
01:09:49,397 --> 01:09:51,224
- Bunny and...
- Katie, Katie, Katie.

984
01:09:51,566 --> 01:09:54,852
This is who I've been telling you
about. Sully, my brother.

985
01:09:55,195 --> 01:09:56,938
Oh, it's her brother!

986
01:10:03,161 --> 01:10:04,953
I have a brother. I have a brother.

987
01:10:05,288 --> 01:10:06,569
No, no. Don't sit there.

988
01:10:06,915 --> 01:10:09,406
I'm not gonna sit there,
I'm siting here.

989
01:10:16,383 --> 01:10:18,210
No, thank you.

990
01:10:25,142 --> 01:10:26,387
Kate.

991
01:10:35,694 --> 01:10:37,437
Kate, please?

992
01:10:40,907 --> 01:10:42,402
It's my heart.

993
01:10:50,876 --> 01:10:55,337
Juanita, I don't want any material
that's gonna gather by her hips.

994
01:10:55,672 --> 01:10:57,297
It's not flattering.

995
01:10:59,218 --> 01:11:00,712
It doesn't need to be taken in.

996
01:11:01,053 --> 01:11:03,045
Olga, please help me out here?

997
01:11:03,388 --> 01:11:04,337
Stop smoking.

998
01:11:04,681 --> 01:11:06,591
I'm gonna smoke, Dee Dee.

999
01:11:14,983 --> 01:11:17,060
But I also want this to come down...

1000
01:11:17,403 --> 01:11:20,403
Can somebody get me
a Diet Coke, please?

1001
01:11:22,866 --> 01:11:27,279
Her breastbone is the best part of
her body, so if it could come down.

1002
01:11:30,291 --> 01:11:33,245
- Doesn't she look beautiful?
- She looks really beautiful.

1003
01:11:33,544 --> 01:11:35,786
- Get Marilyn champagne!
- I've got some.

1004
01:11:36,088 --> 01:11:37,582
- You know what?
- What?

1005
01:11:37,923 --> 01:11:41,458
I'm fine, really. Everything's
fine. The dress is fine.

1006
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:44,086
I really wouldn't worry about
me at all, okay?

1007
01:12:02,865 --> 01:12:04,359
Hello!

1008
01:12:05,367 --> 01:12:06,566
Dad?

1009
01:12:08,788 --> 01:12:10,412
Is anybody here?

1010
01:12:17,588 --> 01:12:18,999
Where is everybody?

1011
01:12:19,298 --> 01:12:20,377
Connie?

1012
01:12:23,469 --> 01:12:27,218
Your dad said that we could
close up shop early tonight.

1013
01:12:27,556 --> 01:12:31,305
So I'm just cleaning up his desk,
which is always a mess.

1014
01:12:31,644 --> 01:12:33,186
The cleaning crew can't dust...

1015
01:12:33,521 --> 01:12:34,683
Where'd he go?

1016
01:12:37,024 --> 01:12:38,816
- Tyler.
- To go see Mom?

1017
01:12:39,151 --> 01:12:40,480
I guess.

1018
01:12:40,778 --> 01:12:43,186
When did he say
he was gonna come back?

1019
01:12:45,825 --> 01:12:49,443
I know he wanted to be back in time
for the city council meeting.

1020
01:12:49,787 --> 01:12:52,325
They're voting on the freeway thingy.

1021
01:12:52,665 --> 01:12:54,040
Probably as we speak.

1022
01:12:54,375 --> 01:12:57,210
This issue has been before
the council previously.

1023
01:12:57,545 --> 01:12:59,751
Last time it was defeated by one vote.

1024
01:13:00,089 --> 01:13:02,759
Today we represent 64 women's
organizations.

1025
01:13:03,092 --> 01:13:06,841
We trust you'll vote on behalf of
the majority of the people concerned.

1026
01:13:07,180 --> 01:13:10,513
I'd like to point out
Dr. Sullivan Travis is here with us.

1027
01:13:10,850 --> 01:13:14,848
He's a great proponent of this issue,
and willing to speak if necessary.

1028
01:13:15,188 --> 01:13:19,684
We feel it's important to save council
time, and get on with the vote.

1029
01:13:20,026 --> 01:13:21,686
Thank you, Mrs. Williamson.

1030
01:13:27,033 --> 01:13:28,527
Council, is there any discussion?

1031
01:13:28,868 --> 01:13:32,617
Yeah, I just see three names on
this agenda in front of me here.

1032
01:13:32,956 --> 01:13:35,363
Annette Strauss, Mary Kay Ash
and Jayne Mansfield.

1033
01:13:35,667 --> 01:13:37,992
You know, I need to come in
and see you this week.

1034
01:13:39,379 --> 01:13:40,956
It's really no big deal.

1035
01:13:41,798 --> 01:13:44,799
In spin class I hurt my tinker.

1036
01:13:45,260 --> 01:13:48,177
- Annette Strauss is the best candidate.
- You would.

1037
01:13:51,808 --> 01:13:55,675
Congratulations.
The Annette Strauss Memorial Parkway.

1038
01:13:56,021 --> 01:13:58,262
My God, you made a lot of women
happy today.

1039
01:13:58,606 --> 01:13:59,602
Yeah, I hope so.

1040
01:14:02,485 --> 01:14:03,861
You happy?

1041
01:14:05,488 --> 01:14:06,983
Yes, I am.

1042
01:14:11,536 --> 01:14:13,328
Do I make you happy?

1043
01:14:14,664 --> 01:14:16,206
I'm a very happy person.

1044
01:14:16,541 --> 01:14:17,490
Are you?

1045
01:14:19,002 --> 01:14:22,371
Very happy. Very, very, very happy.

1046
01:14:22,881 --> 01:14:24,505
I'm a happy man.

1047
01:14:35,060 --> 01:14:38,014
Marsha, Jenny has an insurance
problem I cannot deal with.

1048
01:14:38,313 --> 01:14:39,855
What is going on today?

1049
01:14:40,524 --> 01:14:43,275
You're not on the list.
Hang on a second.

1050
01:14:46,029 --> 01:14:46,978
It's loud!

1051
01:14:47,406 --> 01:14:50,360
Let's go to the bathroom before
Uncle Sully's office.

1052
01:14:50,659 --> 01:14:53,232
- Everybody's here!
- You look so pretty!

1053
01:14:53,620 --> 01:14:56,407
We're just gonna use the bathroom.
Go tee-tee.

1054
01:14:56,873 --> 01:14:58,617
Bye, Judy, see you a little later.

1055
01:15:01,044 --> 01:15:03,001
Well, hello!

1056
01:15:06,550 --> 01:15:08,293
- Sweet thing.
- Hey, darling.

1057
01:15:08,635 --> 01:15:10,011
Oh, honey, come on.

1058
01:15:10,345 --> 01:15:13,097
I'm sorry, sweetie. Come here, baby.
Come here.

1059
01:15:14,683 --> 01:15:16,474
Just sign in and have a seat.

1060
01:15:16,810 --> 01:15:18,554
- Has your information changed?
- No.

1061
01:15:18,896 --> 01:15:20,354
We'll be right with you.

1062
01:15:20,689 --> 01:15:22,895
Hi, Mrs. Chamblis, how are you?

1063
01:15:23,233 --> 01:15:25,356
Not well. I need to see the doctor.

1064
01:15:25,694 --> 01:15:28,150
- You don't have an appointment.
- I know I don't...

1065
01:15:28,489 --> 01:15:32,237
- Dorothy, I'm so happy to see you.
- You are?

1066
01:15:32,576 --> 01:15:36,075
If you don't mind, darling,
we need another specimen.

1067
01:15:36,413 --> 01:15:38,869
- Is something wrong?
- No, no, no.

1068
01:15:39,667 --> 01:15:41,244
We spilled it.

1069
01:15:41,543 --> 01:15:42,290
You spilled it?

1070
01:15:42,753 --> 01:15:45,078
Well, I hope you didn't
ruin your shoes.

1071
01:15:45,422 --> 01:15:46,502
Mid-stream, please.

1072
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:52,547
She looks fantastic.

1073
01:15:52,846 --> 01:15:54,389
I hated it.

1074
01:15:55,099 --> 01:15:57,341
Oh, Daddy. It's okay.

1075
01:15:58,060 --> 01:15:59,803
Connie, come here.

1076
01:16:03,107 --> 01:16:04,056
Everything is...

1077
01:16:04,358 --> 01:16:05,521
- You okay?
- I'm okay.

1078
01:16:05,860 --> 01:16:07,769
Just trying to get in the group hug.

1079
01:16:08,112 --> 01:16:10,151
I'm so happy she looks good.

1080
01:16:10,823 --> 01:16:13,907
- I got tangled up in this cape.
- You all right?

1081
01:16:20,833 --> 01:16:23,158
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

1082
01:16:24,045 --> 01:16:26,417
If you would just
calm down a little bit...

1083
01:16:26,756 --> 01:16:29,626
...your blood pressure would be
healthier, and so would ours.

1084
01:16:29,925 --> 01:16:32,879
I don't have a blood pressure problem.
Thank you very much.

1085
01:16:33,220 --> 01:16:36,921
Maybe some of this hormone
replacement therapy might help you.

1086
01:16:38,267 --> 01:16:41,932
They're unveiling the new
cheerleading calendar.

1087
01:16:42,605 --> 01:16:44,147
Really? Will you be in it?

1088
01:16:44,482 --> 01:16:45,893
I'm trying to talk to my dad!

1089
01:16:47,276 --> 01:16:48,984
I'm trying to talk for one second!

1090
01:16:50,404 --> 01:16:53,358
And anyway, they're unveiling
the calendar.

1091
01:16:53,658 --> 01:16:56,362
Well, listen.
Next year you're gonna make it.

1092
01:16:57,078 --> 01:16:59,367
You're too pretty for
everybody else now.

1093
01:16:59,664 --> 01:17:01,952
I didn't do good on the written test.

1094
01:17:02,291 --> 01:17:05,458
- There's that guy, Tom Laundry?
- Landry.

1095
01:17:06,587 --> 01:17:09,257
I know you're feeling
a little bit down.

1096
01:17:10,383 --> 01:17:12,541
Honey, give Uncle Sully
back that fetus.

1097
01:17:12,885 --> 01:17:15,922
There was that guy, Starbuck.
Roger Starbuck.

1098
01:17:18,182 --> 01:17:20,638
It's okay, I'm right here.
Here's this thing.

1099
01:17:22,520 --> 01:17:24,928
Bye, honey, I'm sorry.
Bye-bye, y'all.

1100
01:17:25,940 --> 01:17:27,185
Daddy, can l...?

1101
01:17:27,483 --> 01:17:28,646
Forget it.

1102
01:17:28,985 --> 01:17:30,360
- Bye-bye.
- We'll see you.

1103
01:17:30,695 --> 01:17:32,023
Here we go, doc.

1104
01:17:32,363 --> 01:17:33,561
Oh, Lord.

1105
01:17:34,657 --> 01:17:38,073
Yeah. Okay, well,
this became a community pizza.

1106
01:17:38,411 --> 01:17:41,365
They left you half.
That was generous, huh?

1107
01:17:41,706 --> 01:17:44,790
I forgot my purse in Daddy's office.
I'll run and get it.

1108
01:17:45,126 --> 01:17:47,831
- I've got to go. I'm so late.
- I'll get it later.

1109
01:17:48,129 --> 01:17:52,174
A quiet couple of minutes by myself
for lunch. That's all I want.

1110
01:17:52,467 --> 01:17:53,380
- Thank you.
- Okay.

1111
01:17:55,720 --> 01:17:58,674
- Connie! Can I get you something?
- I forgot my purse.

1112
01:17:58,973 --> 01:18:00,432
- Can I get it?
- It's okay.

1113
01:18:00,767 --> 01:18:04,100
It's a private, a private personal
family... Thank you.

1114
01:18:07,107 --> 01:18:08,269
Hey, Dad.

1115
01:18:08,775 --> 01:18:11,942
- Can I talk to you in private?
- Sure.

1116
01:18:12,237 --> 01:18:14,775
- This is ridiculous.
- Can you work it out?

1117
01:18:15,115 --> 01:18:16,858
You better take a pill.

1118
01:18:17,200 --> 01:18:19,358
Excuse me, Bree Davis
to see Dr. Travis.

1119
01:18:19,703 --> 01:18:21,245
We're all here to see Dr. T.

1120
01:18:21,579 --> 01:18:24,415
I have an appointment,
for all the good it's done.

1121
01:18:24,749 --> 01:18:27,703
It's one of those days.
I don't see you on my list.

1122
01:18:28,044 --> 01:18:30,831
I don't have an appointment,
but he's expecting me.

1123
01:18:31,172 --> 01:18:32,501
He's with a patient now.

1124
01:18:32,841 --> 01:18:36,424
Take a seat and when he's free I'll
call him and work it out.

1125
01:18:36,761 --> 01:18:37,710
- Thanks.
- Okay.

1126
01:18:38,138 --> 01:18:42,301
I get more nervous waiting. It's the
fourth time I've tried to see him.

1127
01:18:42,642 --> 01:18:45,430
I haven't been
to a male gynaecologist in years.

1128
01:18:45,770 --> 01:18:49,851
Honey, it'll be fine. Trust me. The
man knows how to handle a speculum.

1129
01:18:50,150 --> 01:18:51,313
Dad...

1130
01:18:54,613 --> 01:18:56,486
...you can't let Dee Dee get married.

1131
01:18:56,823 --> 01:18:58,365
Why not?

1132
01:18:58,700 --> 01:19:00,194
Bart's a real nice guy.

1133
01:19:00,494 --> 01:19:02,403
He adores her, worships her.

1134
01:19:02,746 --> 01:19:06,245
I can't imagine he won't be
a really great husband to her.

1135
01:19:08,669 --> 01:19:12,287
Unless there's something about him
I should know that I don't.

1136
01:19:13,173 --> 01:19:16,293
No, but there's something you
should know about Dee Dee.

1137
01:19:16,635 --> 01:19:17,631
What is it?

1138
01:19:24,476 --> 01:19:26,267
She's a lesbian.

1139
01:19:29,523 --> 01:19:30,685
What?

1140
01:19:31,024 --> 01:19:33,017
Daddy, I'm serious. She is.

1141
01:19:33,443 --> 01:19:36,480
I hate to be the one that has
to tell you this, I am...

1142
01:19:36,822 --> 01:19:40,357
...but that girl from Houston,
her so-called maid of honour...

1143
01:19:40,701 --> 01:19:41,650
...Marilyn?

1144
01:19:41,994 --> 01:19:44,615
I didn't think I was gonna have
to tell you this.

1145
01:19:44,955 --> 01:19:47,528
Remember when Dee Dee
was down at Houston...

1146
01:19:47,833 --> 01:19:50,502
...before she transferred
back up here to SMU?

1147
01:19:50,836 --> 01:19:52,378
She and Marilyn had a...

1148
01:19:54,089 --> 01:19:55,667
...you know...

1149
01:19:57,259 --> 01:19:58,422
...a thing.

1150
01:20:01,847 --> 01:20:03,092
Are you sure?

1151
01:20:03,557 --> 01:20:05,182
Dad, I'm positive.

1152
01:20:05,517 --> 01:20:09,266
Remember last year when I went to
surprise Dee Dee on her birthday?

1153
01:20:09,605 --> 01:20:11,099
I surprised her, all right.

1154
01:20:11,398 --> 01:20:14,020
Dad, I surprised all three of us.

1155
01:20:14,568 --> 01:20:17,854
I didn't say anything because
I thought she was experimenting...

1156
01:20:18,197 --> 01:20:21,151
...or trying something new
and she would do it...

1157
01:20:21,492 --> 01:20:23,864
...one or two times
and it wasn't a big deal.

1158
01:20:24,203 --> 01:20:26,955
You know, it was like a college
thing and whatever.

1159
01:20:28,791 --> 01:20:33,417
Marilyn has been up several times for
dress fittings and I can tell you...

1160
01:20:33,712 --> 01:20:35,290
...it is not over between them.

1161
01:20:35,589 --> 01:20:37,381
I don't know what to say.

1162
01:20:38,259 --> 01:20:42,506
I'm sorry, I really am. I know you've
got your own worries right now...

1163
01:20:42,847 --> 01:20:46,429
...about Mom and Peggy moving back in
with you with her kids.

1164
01:20:46,767 --> 01:20:49,721
Dr. T, the fillies are getting
a little restless.

1165
01:20:55,568 --> 01:20:56,599
Bye.

1166
01:20:59,196 --> 01:21:01,984
Anyway, I gotta get back down
to the museum.

1167
01:21:02,325 --> 01:21:05,409
More evidence came in
about the real John Wilkes Booth...

1168
01:21:05,745 --> 01:21:09,114
...hiding and living guess where?
Enid, Oklahoma until 1903.

1169
01:21:09,457 --> 01:21:12,208
I know I'll get
a zillion questions today.

1170
01:21:12,543 --> 01:21:14,417
Then we can talk about Mom later.

1171
01:21:14,754 --> 01:21:19,297
And about Peggy and her kids because
they seem unhappy and disoriented.

1172
01:21:19,634 --> 01:21:21,294
Don't you think? I do.

1173
01:21:21,636 --> 01:21:25,301
More importantly, we should
definitely discuss this Marilyn thing.

1174
01:21:25,723 --> 01:21:26,802
Bye.

1175
01:21:30,019 --> 01:21:31,394
Daddy?

1176
01:21:31,729 --> 01:21:32,892
Yes?

1177
01:21:33,356 --> 01:21:38,065
Don't worry about me at all, okay?
Everything's fine with me. Really.

1178
01:21:45,493 --> 01:21:46,489
Dr. T?

1179
01:21:46,828 --> 01:21:49,366
- Dr. T, are you in there?
- Yes, I'm here.

1180
01:21:49,706 --> 01:21:53,075
There's a lady named
Bree Davis here to see you.

1181
01:21:53,418 --> 01:21:56,288
- She doesn't have an appointment.
- Lunch!

1182
01:21:56,796 --> 01:21:58,623
I heard he has a gentle touch.

1183
01:21:58,965 --> 01:22:01,421
If you ask him,
he'll use the small speculum.

1184
01:22:01,718 --> 01:22:04,553
I asked him because I hadn't had sex
in a long time...

1185
01:22:04,846 --> 01:22:06,305
Excuse me, Miss Davis?

1186
01:22:06,639 --> 01:22:08,596
Just follow me, sweetie.

1187
01:22:08,933 --> 01:22:11,768
What is that?
She's been here five minutes...

1188
01:22:12,103 --> 01:22:13,847
Tina, I'll show her back.

1189
01:22:14,189 --> 01:22:16,940
- Follow me, please.
- Whatever you say, boss.

1190
01:22:17,233 --> 01:22:18,431
I'm so sorry.

1191
01:22:18,777 --> 01:22:22,311
You wouldn't believe what's
been going on today. Come in.

1192
01:22:22,655 --> 01:22:26,439
- We've got lots of ladies.
- Thank you. I'll be right with you.

1193
01:22:26,743 --> 01:22:29,198
My God, is it always like that here?

1194
01:22:29,537 --> 01:22:31,032
Always.

1195
01:22:31,956 --> 01:22:34,494
- I am so sorry.
- That's okay.

1196
01:22:34,834 --> 01:22:36,032
I don't...

1197
01:22:37,962 --> 01:22:41,047
I can't get through an hour
without thinking about you.

1198
01:22:41,341 --> 01:22:43,749
- I don't know how I forgot...
- I won't starve.

1199
01:22:44,052 --> 01:22:45,215
You want some pizza?

1200
01:22:45,512 --> 01:22:49,212
- My God, you're having a rough day.
- How'd you guess?

1201
01:22:49,557 --> 01:22:51,883
It's written all over you.
What's wrong?

1202
01:22:52,227 --> 01:22:53,804
Wrong?

1203
01:22:54,145 --> 01:22:55,344
Nothing, nothing.

1204
01:22:55,689 --> 01:22:58,939
I can tell when something's
bothering you. What is it?

1205
01:22:59,734 --> 01:23:01,893
Sit down a second, will you?

1206
01:23:08,118 --> 01:23:10,241
I just had some...

1207
01:23:11,037 --> 01:23:13,789
...weird news...

1208
01:23:14,082 --> 01:23:15,874
...from my daughter, Connie.

1209
01:23:16,168 --> 01:23:17,199
What is it?

1210
01:23:18,879 --> 01:23:22,579
Maybe I shouldn't talk about this yet.
Maybe I should let it settle.

1211
01:23:22,924 --> 01:23:25,047
Come on. Listen, you want to talk.

1212
01:23:25,385 --> 01:23:28,386
You want to get something off
your chest and I have time.

1213
01:23:28,680 --> 01:23:30,056
What is it?

1214
01:23:32,059 --> 01:23:33,601
Come on.

1215
01:23:33,977 --> 01:23:35,258
All right.

1216
01:23:35,604 --> 01:23:38,177
I don't know
how much truth there is to this.

1217
01:23:41,276 --> 01:23:44,230
Connie came here and told
me that I shouldn't...

1218
01:23:44,529 --> 01:23:47,981
...allow my other daughter,
Dee Dee, to get married...

1219
01:23:48,283 --> 01:23:49,861
...because she's a lesbian.

1220
01:23:52,120 --> 01:23:54,446
- Dee Dee's the cheerleader?
- Yeah.

1221
01:23:54,873 --> 01:23:55,822
Really?

1222
01:23:56,166 --> 01:23:58,836
Well, not necessarily is, but was.

1223
01:23:59,211 --> 01:24:00,705
I mean...

1224
01:24:02,422 --> 01:24:05,092
Christ, I don't know what I mean.

1225
01:24:07,803 --> 01:24:09,926
Well, yeah.

1226
01:24:10,264 --> 01:24:12,470
What Connie said was that...

1227
01:24:12,808 --> 01:24:16,758
...when Dee Dee was down at Houston
last year at school...

1228
01:24:17,563 --> 01:24:21,774
...she had a relationship
with this girl named Marilyn.

1229
01:24:22,067 --> 01:24:25,234
I assume she meant
sexual relationship.

1230
01:24:25,571 --> 01:24:28,572
This same Marilyn is going to be
her maid of honour.

1231
01:24:30,826 --> 01:24:34,776
Well, at least they still respected
each other the next morning.

1232
01:24:37,583 --> 01:24:40,750
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to make a joke about that.

1233
01:24:41,045 --> 01:24:43,915
- That's okay.
- Really, I'm sorry.

1234
01:24:44,256 --> 01:24:48,468
I think you might be making
a little too much of this.

1235
01:24:49,136 --> 01:24:50,963
But it is serious, isn't it?

1236
01:24:51,305 --> 01:24:53,594
This is very ser...

1237
01:24:53,933 --> 01:24:56,305
She's getting married. I mean, l...

1238
01:24:57,603 --> 01:24:59,311
I just don't know what she...

1239
01:24:59,605 --> 01:25:01,016
I want her to be happy.

1240
01:25:01,732 --> 01:25:05,944
You know what? This is the first time
I've ever seen you look so scared.

1241
01:25:06,696 --> 01:25:08,902
- What are you scared of?
- I don't know.

1242
01:25:09,240 --> 01:25:10,782
I don't know.

1243
01:25:11,075 --> 01:25:12,653
You want my opinion?

1244
01:25:13,869 --> 01:25:15,364
Yeah.

1245
01:25:16,747 --> 01:25:19,321
Do you remember when we first met
what you said?

1246
01:25:19,667 --> 01:25:20,616
No, what?

1247
01:25:20,960 --> 01:25:24,329
You said that every woman
is special in her own way.

1248
01:25:24,672 --> 01:25:28,088
That there's no two alike.
So if that's true...

1249
01:25:28,384 --> 01:25:32,464
...then Dee Dee is Dee Dee.
Let her be who she is.

1250
01:25:32,805 --> 01:25:37,681
If she loves this guy and wants to get
married, who cares what she did with...

1251
01:25:38,019 --> 01:25:39,762
- What is her name?
- Marilyn.

1252
01:25:40,062 --> 01:25:41,058
Who cares?

1253
01:25:41,397 --> 01:25:43,354
Judy, I'm not feeling very well.

1254
01:25:43,691 --> 01:25:46,478
- I'm getting that hot feeling.
- Get some water.

1255
01:25:46,819 --> 01:25:48,859
- Take a deep breath.
- My throat's dry...

1256
01:25:49,822 --> 01:25:51,482
No, please don't. Please go...

1257
01:25:52,033 --> 01:25:53,029
I'm so sorry.

1258
01:25:53,367 --> 01:25:56,285
- But you know...
- Thank you. Give us a minute.

1259
01:25:56,704 --> 01:25:58,946
We have so very many
people out there.

1260
01:25:59,248 --> 01:26:01,490
- Could you give us...
- Women people, Dr. T.

1261
01:26:01,834 --> 01:26:04,788
Thanks very much, I'll be out.
I'll be right out.

1262
01:26:09,634 --> 01:26:11,757
I got a really good idea.

1263
01:26:12,095 --> 01:26:15,298
Why don't you and I
just get together tonight after work.

1264
01:26:16,724 --> 01:26:20,058
We'll find a nice romantic
restaurant somewhere.

1265
01:26:20,395 --> 01:26:23,396
Is that good for you?
Because it would be good for me.

1266
01:26:23,731 --> 01:26:27,515
I would love that, but I can't.
I'm going out of town for a few days.

1267
01:26:27,819 --> 01:26:29,443
- My plane leaves at five.
- Where?

1268
01:26:29,779 --> 01:26:31,273
New Orleans.

1269
01:26:32,073 --> 01:26:34,860
It's a golf thing.
I'm going with a friend.

1270
01:26:35,201 --> 01:26:38,985
Listen, your office is going crazy
out there, so I'm gonna go.

1271
01:26:39,330 --> 01:26:41,288
I'll call you as soon as I get back.

1272
01:26:42,959 --> 01:26:45,450
Where are you staying?
I can call the hotel.

1273
01:26:45,754 --> 01:26:47,129
At least say good night.

1274
01:26:47,422 --> 01:26:49,995
I don't know where I'll be.
My friend arranged it.

1275
01:26:50,508 --> 01:26:52,252
I'll call you. Don't worry.

1276
01:26:52,594 --> 01:26:54,421
I'll be back before you know it.

1277
01:26:55,221 --> 01:26:56,170
Bye.

1278
01:26:56,514 --> 01:26:58,424
I wish you would please take a seat.

1279
01:26:59,351 --> 01:27:02,969
I've waited here long enough.
I feel it's time for me to get in.

1280
01:27:04,189 --> 01:27:07,309
Dr. T, I'm sorry. I know
you've got a lot going on.

1281
01:27:07,776 --> 01:27:10,896
I don't want to tell you
what's going on in waiting room.

1282
01:27:11,196 --> 01:27:13,438
But we'll never get out of here
tonight...

1283
01:27:13,740 --> 01:27:14,689
Who've we got?

1284
01:27:15,033 --> 01:27:17,702
Good. We've got Melinda Jones...

1285
01:27:18,036 --> 01:27:20,907
...pregnancy follow-up
in Phyllis George.

1286
01:27:21,248 --> 01:27:25,542
Hildy's back. Guess the amoxicillin
didn't work. She's in Ann Richards.

1287
01:27:25,877 --> 01:27:28,664
And we have a new one.
Oh, she's really something.

1288
01:27:29,005 --> 01:27:33,134
Dr. T? It's your lawyer, Sam Levy.
He says it's important. Can you talk?

1289
01:27:33,468 --> 01:27:35,508
All right, put him through.

1290
01:27:36,179 --> 01:27:38,255
She's in Belle Starr.

1291
01:27:38,598 --> 01:27:39,879
Sam, what is it?

1292
01:27:40,225 --> 01:27:43,760
Sully, I got some bad news.
I hope you're sitting down.

1293
01:27:44,104 --> 01:27:46,143
Kate wants a divorce.

1294
01:27:47,399 --> 01:27:48,644
Sam.

1295
01:27:53,822 --> 01:27:56,776
She said I could have her appointment.
Let me in.

1296
01:27:57,075 --> 01:27:59,946
I can't just see you
when you just walk in here.

1297
01:28:00,287 --> 01:28:03,537
- She's such an idiot, really.
- I don't have to take this.

1298
01:28:04,875 --> 01:28:06,784
What are you looking at?

1299
01:28:07,753 --> 01:28:09,710
- Happy?
- It has nothing to do with it.

1300
01:28:10,047 --> 01:28:13,250
Could you sit down and wait?
I'm getting Dr. Travis.

1301
01:28:13,800 --> 01:28:16,920
I'm sorry, there is absolutely
no smoking whatsoever!

1302
01:28:17,471 --> 01:28:20,258
I don't know what to say.
Could you call me later?

1303
01:28:20,599 --> 01:28:22,841
Sam, please? Do me a favour.

1304
01:28:23,227 --> 01:28:25,433
Oh, Dr. T, I'm so sorry...

1305
01:28:25,771 --> 01:28:27,230
Sorry for the interruption...

1306
01:28:27,564 --> 01:28:30,020
...but we've got a situation.
Dorothy Chamblis.

1307
01:28:30,484 --> 01:28:31,599
Jesus!

1308
01:28:31,944 --> 01:28:35,527
- She's locked herself in the bathroom.
- I'll handle this, Dr. T.

1309
01:28:39,159 --> 01:28:41,069
Everybody has gone crazy.

1310
01:28:54,300 --> 01:28:55,794
You ready?

1311
01:28:58,012 --> 01:29:00,384
All right.
Ready or not, here we come.

1312
01:29:02,516 --> 01:29:05,850
- Hi, there. I'm Dr. Travis.
- Hello.

1313
01:29:06,187 --> 01:29:10,813
Congratulations. First timers don't
usually get the Belle Starr room.

1314
01:29:11,233 --> 01:29:13,107
I feel honoured.

1315
01:29:13,694 --> 01:29:16,232
So who's Belle Starr?

1316
01:29:16,781 --> 01:29:18,654
- Not from Dallas, are you?
- No.

1317
01:29:18,991 --> 01:29:19,987
No. Marilyn.

1318
01:29:21,494 --> 01:29:24,245
So what have we got?
Vaginal infection?

1319
01:29:24,538 --> 01:29:27,160
Why don't we have a look?
See what's going on.

1320
01:29:27,458 --> 01:29:30,625
Gonna be very gentle.
Nothing to worry about here.

1321
01:29:31,504 --> 01:29:35,086
So, you don't know
who Belle Starr is?

1322
01:29:35,383 --> 01:29:37,209
Well, Belle Starr...

1323
01:29:37,551 --> 01:29:40,007
...is a Dallas legend. Alrighty.

1324
01:29:40,346 --> 01:29:42,089
Yeah, she was a wild thing.

1325
01:29:44,141 --> 01:29:45,304
There you go.

1326
01:29:45,643 --> 01:29:47,303
Thank you.

1327
01:29:47,770 --> 01:29:51,104
I can't believe Dr. T would allow
a bitch like that in here.

1328
01:29:51,440 --> 01:29:53,065
He plays golf with her husband.

1329
01:29:53,401 --> 01:29:54,646
Gives Dallas a bad name.

1330
01:29:54,986 --> 01:29:56,563
I heard that, bitch!

1331
01:29:59,115 --> 01:30:00,360
Oh, dear!

1332
01:30:00,700 --> 01:30:02,159
Oh, my goodness!

1333
01:30:03,911 --> 01:30:05,904
- Excuse me, ladies.
- Ladies, back up.

1334
01:30:06,247 --> 01:30:07,243
Give her some air!

1335
01:30:07,623 --> 01:30:09,034
Okay, touching my leg.

1336
01:30:09,375 --> 01:30:12,080
Okay, I'll be entering you now.
Take it easy.

1337
01:30:12,378 --> 01:30:13,457
Where are you from?

1338
01:30:14,964 --> 01:30:18,878
I'm originally from Connecticut
but I've been living in Houston.

1339
01:30:19,510 --> 01:30:21,503
Houston. Alrighty.

1340
01:30:22,263 --> 01:30:23,841
So what brings you to Dallas?

1341
01:30:24,182 --> 01:30:29,009
I'm here for a bridesmaid fitting
for Dee Dee's wedding.

1342
01:30:30,355 --> 01:30:31,635
- Doctor?
- I'm her...

1343
01:30:31,981 --> 01:30:33,938
I'm her maid of honour, Marilyn.

1344
01:30:34,275 --> 01:30:38,355
I think I've got a yeast infection.
Probably from all the wedding stress.

1345
01:30:39,906 --> 01:30:40,902
Yes?

1346
01:30:41,241 --> 01:30:43,114
I'm sorry, but we have a situation.

1347
01:30:43,451 --> 01:30:44,993
No, come in. Come in here.

1348
01:30:45,328 --> 01:30:46,787
Come in, Carolyn.

1349
01:30:47,121 --> 01:30:50,704
Well, it's Dorothy.
As soon as you can, it'd be real good.

1350
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,491
- Yes, I'll be right there.
- Thank you so much.

1351
01:30:53,837 --> 01:30:55,710
Yes. No, I will.

1352
01:30:59,008 --> 01:31:02,259
Tina could you take...
I think we do have...

1353
01:31:02,554 --> 01:31:04,463
...yeast.
- That's what I thought.

1354
01:31:04,848 --> 01:31:08,347
Could you do the smear for me, please?
I appreciate that.

1355
01:31:08,685 --> 01:31:11,555
I'll... Thank you.
Thank you very much.

1356
01:31:13,189 --> 01:31:15,515
Let's move back
and give her some air.

1357
01:31:15,859 --> 01:31:17,567
Get back! Give her some air!

1358
01:31:21,323 --> 01:31:23,362
Move back, everything's fine.

1359
01:31:24,075 --> 01:31:25,451
Move around, move around.

1360
01:31:25,744 --> 01:31:27,820
I've got it. Tell me what happened.

1361
01:31:28,163 --> 01:31:29,705
She fell and hit her head.

1362
01:31:29,998 --> 01:31:31,540
You called paramedics?

1363
01:31:31,875 --> 01:31:33,867
Can you open your eyes, Dorothy?

1364
01:31:34,169 --> 01:31:37,419
She's fine.
Ladies, quiet, move back now.

1365
01:31:59,027 --> 01:32:01,518
- Don't touch your head.
- I see.

1366
01:32:01,863 --> 01:32:03,903
Not now. Oh, her purse.

1367
01:32:04,241 --> 01:32:07,111
Just because Dr. T plays golf...

1368
01:32:07,619 --> 01:32:11,451
It's gonna be okay, Mrs. Chamblis.

1369
01:32:11,748 --> 01:32:13,290
Oh, throw up in your purse.

1370
01:32:14,084 --> 01:32:16,041
- In your purse.
- I come from wealth.

1371
01:32:16,378 --> 01:32:17,374
I know you do.

1372
01:32:17,921 --> 01:32:19,748
Very wealthy.

1373
01:32:22,593 --> 01:32:24,253
I think he knows, Dee Dee.

1374
01:32:24,595 --> 01:32:26,836
- Who?
- Your dad.

1375
01:32:27,431 --> 01:32:31,014
- Knows what?
- You know, knows about us.

1376
01:32:31,476 --> 01:32:34,680
- Knows what about us?
- Knows about our relationship...

1377
01:32:35,022 --> 01:32:37,310
...or ex-relationship, whatever it is.

1378
01:32:37,649 --> 01:32:42,276
Well, what makes you think he knows
about all that?

1379
01:32:42,613 --> 01:32:44,819
I don't know. I could just tell.

1380
01:32:45,908 --> 01:32:48,529
How? By the way he examined you?

1381
01:32:48,827 --> 01:32:53,536
No, he just acted real nervous
after I told him who I was.

1382
01:32:54,041 --> 01:32:57,326
It seemed like, you know,
hard for him...

1383
01:32:57,670 --> 01:32:59,792
...to look at me down there.

1384
01:33:01,006 --> 01:33:05,336
You're just being paranoid.
There's no way he could find out.

1385
01:33:05,678 --> 01:33:08,050
Only people who know are you and me.

1386
01:33:09,098 --> 01:33:10,296
And Connie.

1387
01:33:10,599 --> 01:33:13,351
- Connie won't say anything.
- Right.

1388
01:33:15,354 --> 01:33:18,390
I just don't know about
being up here in Dallas...

1389
01:33:18,732 --> 01:33:21,188
...and doing this
whole wedding thing...

1390
01:33:21,527 --> 01:33:23,769
It just doesn't feel right.

1391
01:33:26,198 --> 01:33:28,155
And I'm starting to feel...

1392
01:33:29,160 --> 01:33:30,191
...like a...

1393
01:33:31,120 --> 01:33:34,952
- Like what, honey?
- Like a bridesmaid.

1394
01:33:35,958 --> 01:33:38,414
Don't cry. You'll make me cry.

1395
01:33:38,753 --> 01:33:42,750
Honey, you're not a bridesmaid.
You're so much more than that.

1396
01:33:43,090 --> 01:33:45,664
I mean, you are my girl.

1397
01:33:48,429 --> 01:33:49,840
- Dr. T?
- Yes?

1398
01:33:50,139 --> 01:33:52,547
I'm locking up. Do you need anything?

1399
01:33:52,892 --> 01:33:55,181
- No. I'm fine.
- Okay then.

1400
01:33:55,478 --> 01:33:56,427
Bye.

1401
01:34:03,110 --> 01:34:05,483
Carolyn!
I thought you'd gone already.

1402
01:34:05,821 --> 01:34:06,770
I was locking up.

1403
01:34:07,114 --> 01:34:10,483
I wanted to clean my contacts
before I drove home. I can lock up.

1404
01:34:10,826 --> 01:34:11,989
- Want me to wait?
- No...

1405
01:34:12,328 --> 01:34:14,866
...I need to work on my lens,
I got a smudge.

1406
01:34:15,164 --> 01:34:17,371
It's fine, bye.
I'll see you tomorrow.

1407
01:34:32,098 --> 01:34:33,047
Hey, handsome.

1408
01:34:35,351 --> 01:34:38,103
Carolyn, what are you...
I thought everyone left?

1409
01:34:38,396 --> 01:34:41,350
Oh, come on. You know me.

1410
01:34:41,691 --> 01:34:43,849
I'll always find something to do.

1411
01:34:45,695 --> 01:34:50,024
So, hey, how would you like
a nice massage?

1412
01:34:50,366 --> 01:34:52,940
Come on, you need it.
It's no problem for me.

1413
01:34:53,286 --> 01:34:56,619
Lord Almighty, you've had
a heck of a day, haven't you?

1414
01:34:56,956 --> 01:35:00,539
I'm so sorry everything
was so difficult for you today.

1415
01:35:06,341 --> 01:35:07,751
How's that?

1416
01:35:10,011 --> 01:35:14,056
- Right there.
- Ooh, yeah, big ol' lump.

1417
01:35:19,395 --> 01:35:21,602
- Easing up.
- That's good.

1418
01:35:27,612 --> 01:35:29,735
I don't know what I'd do
without you...

1419
01:35:30,824 --> 01:35:32,022
...Carolyn.

1420
01:35:42,419 --> 01:35:44,826
That's the sweetest thing
I've ever heard.

1421
01:35:45,755 --> 01:35:50,417
Because, you know, Dr. T,
there's nothing that I wouldn't...

1422
01:35:50,760 --> 01:35:53,964
...do for you.
There's nothing I wouldn't do.

1423
01:35:54,306 --> 01:35:56,512
And you don't ever
have to worry about...

1424
01:35:56,850 --> 01:36:00,598
...what you'd do without me.
You don't ever have to worry.

1425
01:36:00,937 --> 01:36:04,982
Because I'm just gonna
be here for you. You know?

1426
01:36:05,275 --> 01:36:08,359
So that's all there is to that.
And, Dr. T...

1427
01:36:08,695 --> 01:36:12,907
...if you don't mind my saying,
you do need a wife.

1428
01:36:13,241 --> 01:36:16,491
You do need a wife.
You need a real good wife...

1429
01:36:16,828 --> 01:36:21,040
...who's as good to you as you are
to so many other people.

1430
01:36:21,375 --> 01:36:24,993
You treat people so special
and you care about them.

1431
01:36:25,337 --> 01:36:30,295
You need a wife who cares about you.
And who adores you.

1432
01:36:31,927 --> 01:36:34,762
You need somebody
to make you feel good.

1433
01:36:35,055 --> 01:36:39,634
I just know that there's a really
special woman out there...

1434
01:36:39,977 --> 01:36:41,934
...who'd be so good to you...

1435
01:36:42,271 --> 01:36:45,474
...who'd make your life complete.

1436
01:36:45,816 --> 01:36:48,770
And you would
make each other so happy.

1437
01:36:53,115 --> 01:36:55,191
- That's better. Thank you.
- No!

1438
01:36:55,492 --> 01:36:56,986
- That's really good.
- Oh.

1439
01:36:57,286 --> 01:37:00,452
You really are special.
You're always there for me.

1440
01:37:00,747 --> 01:37:03,369
Loyal, loyal person.

1441
01:37:06,378 --> 01:37:08,454
I'll see you tomorrow.

1442
01:37:13,886 --> 01:37:14,799
Carolyn?

1443
01:37:15,137 --> 01:37:16,086
Yes?

1444
01:37:17,306 --> 01:37:19,014
What are you doing down there?

1445
01:37:20,976 --> 01:37:23,218
You never do clean your wastebasket.

1446
01:37:23,562 --> 01:37:25,887
So I'm doing that.
I'll see you tomorrow.

1447
01:37:35,366 --> 01:37:36,776
Oh, my God.

1448
01:37:59,598 --> 01:38:01,223
You know, I don't get it.

1449
01:38:02,601 --> 01:38:06,848
Two weeks ago there were enough turkeys
to spit and have dinner for 50.

1450
01:38:10,443 --> 01:38:13,147
I think we ought to try
some of that ridge.

1451
01:38:13,446 --> 01:38:15,604
Down that bottom.
What do you think?

1452
01:38:17,450 --> 01:38:20,569
- We should try the ridge...
- No, don't be antsy.

1453
01:38:20,912 --> 01:38:22,951
Just sit here.

1454
01:38:25,499 --> 01:38:26,780
Be patient.

1455
01:38:27,752 --> 01:38:30,373
Dorothy got her head bandage off
yesterday.

1456
01:38:30,713 --> 01:38:32,670
Yeah. That's good.

1457
01:38:33,007 --> 01:38:36,008
- She didn't have a concussion.
- No, she'll be fine.

1458
01:38:36,344 --> 01:38:37,672
Fourteen stitches.

1459
01:38:38,846 --> 01:38:39,795
She'll be fine.

1460
01:38:41,224 --> 01:38:44,225
She's gonna want to find
another gynaecologist.

1461
01:38:44,644 --> 01:38:47,217
Whatever she wants.
That's probably best.

1462
01:38:47,772 --> 01:38:50,892
But you and me can still
hunt together.

1463
01:38:51,234 --> 01:38:54,650
I mean, nothing's changed
between you and me. Besides...

1464
01:38:55,405 --> 01:38:56,863
...she doesn't need to know.

1465
01:39:02,662 --> 01:39:04,951
- What the hell happened?
- Misfire?

1466
01:39:05,248 --> 01:39:09,459
- Must have been a bad shell.
- No shell. Damn.

1467
01:39:11,170 --> 01:39:12,000
You know what?

1468
01:39:12,672 --> 01:39:17,049
We ought to have a boys' weekend.
Just the four of us.

1469
01:39:17,802 --> 01:39:21,882
- Go someplace different, maybe...
- Sully's got the wedding this weekend.

1470
01:39:22,223 --> 01:39:26,221
Just the four of us.
We can go to Vegas...

1471
01:39:26,519 --> 01:39:29,057
...New Orleans.
I just got back from there.

1472
01:39:29,397 --> 01:39:32,896
That is a great city. Oh, yeah.

1473
01:39:33,526 --> 01:39:35,400
Sexy city, New Orleans.

1474
01:40:05,392 --> 01:40:08,843
Hi, Carolyn. Where were you?
Why are you so late?

1475
01:40:09,145 --> 01:40:10,805
- You look pretty.
- Thank you.

1476
01:40:14,025 --> 01:40:16,267
Better get started,
looks like a storm.

1477
01:40:16,611 --> 01:40:18,983
I prayed for this weather
at my wedding.

1478
01:40:20,907 --> 01:40:22,983
Hey, look who's here, there he is.

1479
01:40:23,326 --> 01:40:25,200
- Sully.
- All gussied up.

1480
01:40:26,455 --> 01:40:28,992
So, Kate, congratulations.

1481
01:40:30,208 --> 01:40:33,162
- Thank you.
- You looking lovely.

1482
01:40:33,879 --> 01:40:34,993
A flower!

1483
01:40:35,297 --> 01:40:38,962
- You're gaining an in-law.
- Think we better get to our seats now.

1484
01:40:39,259 --> 01:40:43,720
I hope you know, we're only here
out of respect for Kate. Joanne.

1485
01:40:44,056 --> 01:40:46,511
- Gonna need an enema.
- Congratulations, Sully.

1486
01:40:48,018 --> 01:40:49,642
Are you coming?

1487
01:40:54,483 --> 01:40:55,763
Dr. T.

1488
01:40:56,068 --> 01:40:58,606
Come on, we're ready for you.

1489
01:41:05,827 --> 01:41:09,742
Flowers are perfect, your wife's
in her seat, so everything's great.

1490
01:41:10,249 --> 01:41:12,158
- Okay, you ready?
- Yes.

1491
01:41:15,129 --> 01:41:18,877
- Don't take anything else off.
- All right.

1492
01:41:26,724 --> 01:41:30,057
- She's pretty, really.
- Hi. Hi, Mom!

1493
01:41:30,853 --> 01:41:34,269
I'm way behind now.
Oh, I'm way behind now.

1494
01:41:35,357 --> 01:41:36,768
Hi!

1495
01:41:37,484 --> 01:41:39,691
Good. Little nervous.

1496
01:41:40,029 --> 01:41:44,821
I'm nervous. Hey, Kate!
Hey, baby girl, you look so beautiful!

1497
01:41:45,117 --> 01:41:47,406
You see? She's a bridesmaid.
All the girls in...

1498
01:41:47,745 --> 01:41:49,868
No, she's getting divorced.

1499
01:41:56,545 --> 01:41:58,253
This weather is horrible.

1500
01:41:59,840 --> 01:42:01,584
Oh, God. This is not good.

1501
01:42:09,016 --> 01:42:10,391
- Can I have some?
- Sure!

1502
01:42:10,726 --> 01:42:12,719
Thank you! Thank you!

1503
01:43:08,618 --> 01:43:09,993
I love you.

1504
01:43:28,262 --> 01:43:30,255
Oh, honey!

1505
01:43:30,556 --> 01:43:32,383
I love you so much, baby.

1506
01:43:32,725 --> 01:43:33,888
I do.

1507
01:43:46,406 --> 01:43:48,197
Daddy, I'm sorry. I'm so happy.

1508
01:43:48,533 --> 01:43:49,731
I'll be all right.

1509
01:43:50,076 --> 01:43:52,947
Just be happy. I love you!

1510
01:43:53,955 --> 01:43:55,912
- It's okay.
- What just happened?

1511
01:43:56,249 --> 01:43:58,372
I think she doesn't feel good...

1512
01:43:58,668 --> 01:44:00,625
...because she's sick.

1513
01:44:00,920 --> 01:44:02,118
Mom!

1514
01:44:02,714 --> 01:44:05,335
Be careful, it's lightning!
Get her out of there!

1515
01:44:05,675 --> 01:44:06,838
Dr. T?

1516
01:44:07,177 --> 01:44:09,846
You know that I have
great affection for you.

1517
01:44:10,138 --> 01:44:11,301
Great affection.

1518
01:44:11,598 --> 01:44:13,804
But I always wanted to be
a pastry chef.

1519
01:44:14,142 --> 01:44:16,894
So I'm quitting my job. Bye-bye.

1520
01:44:21,441 --> 01:44:22,604
Dad...

1521
01:44:22,943 --> 01:44:26,727
...don't worry about me, okay?
Because I'm gonna be fine, okay?

1522
01:44:43,380 --> 01:44:45,372
Kate! Come and get the...

1523
01:44:45,715 --> 01:44:48,835
Will you go in and get her out?

1524
01:44:51,012 --> 01:44:54,049
Well, just take your shoes off.

1525
01:45:36,517 --> 01:45:37,975
My keys!

1526
01:46:33,449 --> 01:46:35,406
Come on in, it's open!

1527
01:46:35,910 --> 01:46:37,072
Bree?

1528
01:46:39,789 --> 01:46:40,951
Bree?

1529
01:46:42,333 --> 01:46:43,531
Bree?

1530
01:46:43,918 --> 01:46:45,910
Sully.

1531
01:46:46,253 --> 01:46:48,661
- What are you doing here?
- Bree, I want...

1532
01:46:49,006 --> 01:46:50,833
I want you to run away with me!

1533
01:46:52,969 --> 01:46:54,214
What?

1534
01:46:54,553 --> 01:46:57,922
I want you to run away with me!

1535
01:46:58,266 --> 01:46:59,641
Oh, my God, you're wet.

1536
01:46:59,976 --> 01:47:01,684
I am wet. I love you.

1537
01:47:01,978 --> 01:47:04,647
I want you. I need you.

1538
01:47:04,981 --> 01:47:09,559
I can't take all this craziness
in my life anymore. These women are...

1539
01:47:09,902 --> 01:47:12,310
Look, I just want you.

1540
01:47:12,613 --> 01:47:14,405
I want to go away, you and me.

1541
01:47:14,740 --> 01:47:16,400
I want you to come downstairs...

1542
01:47:16,742 --> 01:47:19,233
...and catch your breath.
I'll make you tea.

1543
01:47:19,579 --> 01:47:22,330
I'm serious, Bree. Bree, I'm serious.

1544
01:47:22,665 --> 01:47:24,243
I've never been...

1545
01:47:24,584 --> 01:47:26,909
...so serious in all my life.

1546
01:47:28,045 --> 01:47:29,670
I want to go away...

1547
01:47:30,006 --> 01:47:31,286
...with you.

1548
01:47:32,717 --> 01:47:35,255
I want to spend the rest of my life
with you.

1549
01:47:36,471 --> 01:47:38,547
You're different. You're just...

1550
01:47:39,307 --> 01:47:42,474
...different than any woman
I've ever known. Ever.

1551
01:47:42,810 --> 01:47:45,266
I want to be together,
just you and me.

1552
01:47:45,605 --> 01:47:48,310
I want us to get out of here,
as far as we can.

1553
01:47:48,650 --> 01:47:50,358
So come on! Let's just go!

1554
01:47:50,693 --> 01:47:51,938
Let's go! Come on.

1555
01:47:52,236 --> 01:47:55,191
Get in the car and get out of here.
Right this minute!

1556
01:47:55,531 --> 01:47:57,441
Let's just see where it takes us.

1557
01:47:58,910 --> 01:48:00,073
Come on, Bree.

1558
01:48:00,370 --> 01:48:01,568
What do you say?

1559
01:48:01,913 --> 01:48:03,740
I'm sorry. I can't do that.

1560
01:48:06,167 --> 01:48:07,792
I can't go away with you.

1561
01:48:09,796 --> 01:48:11,753
Why not? I love you.

1562
01:48:12,841 --> 01:48:14,465
I need you.

1563
01:48:16,469 --> 01:48:17,845
We can be together.

1564
01:48:18,179 --> 01:48:20,966
You won't have to work,
or give golf lessons...

1565
01:48:21,307 --> 01:48:23,845
...or do anything else
you don't want to do.

1566
01:48:24,728 --> 01:48:26,270
I could take care of you.

1567
01:48:26,604 --> 01:48:29,475
Totally. You'll never
have to worry again.

1568
01:48:29,774 --> 01:48:31,850
Why would I want that?

1569
01:48:50,003 --> 01:48:51,378
New Orleans.

1570
01:48:52,464 --> 01:48:55,797
I can't go to New Orleans with you.
I just got back, remember?

1571
01:48:57,135 --> 01:48:58,464
I know.

1572
01:48:59,804 --> 01:49:01,927
Plus, I made plans.

1573
01:49:06,686 --> 01:49:08,015
Are you with Harlan?

1574
01:49:09,773 --> 01:49:11,682
I'm not with anybody.

1575
01:54:50,824 --> 01:54:52,235
Telephone?

1576
01:55:15,558 --> 01:55:16,838
What's her name?

1577
01:55:17,852 --> 01:55:19,975
Does anyone speak English here?

1578
01:55:23,065 --> 01:55:24,809
Consuela. Agua.
Water.

1579
01:55:26,277 --> 01:55:28,519
You'll be fine. Be fine.

1580
01:55:29,905 --> 01:55:30,985
Push.

1581
01:55:31,824 --> 01:55:32,689
Push.

1582
01:55:37,538 --> 01:55:38,736
All right.

1583
01:55:43,628 --> 01:55:45,419
All right, Consuela.

1584
01:55:47,048 --> 01:55:48,756
All right, now push.

1585
01:55:49,342 --> 01:55:51,085
You're doing good.

1586
01:55:51,427 --> 01:55:53,550
Push now. Push.

1587
01:56:03,856 --> 01:56:06,478
Yes, come on now. A little more.

1588
01:56:09,987 --> 01:56:12,110
Yes! All right, here it comes.

1589
01:56:12,448 --> 01:56:15,651
You're doing real good. Yes! Yes!

1590
01:56:23,626 --> 01:56:25,453
Good. Good. Good.

1591
01:56:43,229 --> 01:56:44,427
It's a boy.

1592
01:56:47,400 --> 01:56:49,440
It's a boy!

1593
01:56:55,325 --> 01:56:56,784
It's a beautiful boy.
