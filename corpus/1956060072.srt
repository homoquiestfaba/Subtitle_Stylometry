1
00:00:05,373 --> 00:00:07,639
And with this Kreitech
miracle micro battery,

2
00:00:07,641 --> 00:00:09,508
we will power the world...

3
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:10,642
together!

4
00:00:13,146 --> 00:00:14,980
Thank you.

5
00:00:14,982 --> 00:00:16,648
I'll take it!

6
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:19,284
Uh, you there,
you shouldn't be in here.

7
00:00:19,286 --> 00:00:23,222
But don't worry, the battery
will be available soon
for purchase.

8
00:00:23,224 --> 00:00:25,391
Did I say "purchase"? Ha!

9
00:00:27,127 --> 00:00:28,227
-Hey!
-Ha!

10
00:00:28,229 --> 00:00:29,828
Pretty sure I said "take it."

11
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:31,030
Ow!

12
00:00:34,467 --> 00:00:36,001
-Ha!
-Aha!

13
00:00:36,003 --> 00:00:37,703
Juniper, what are you
doing here?

14
00:00:37,705 --> 00:00:40,472
Could you please tell Barb,
who I'm not speaking to

15
00:00:40,474 --> 00:00:43,075
because she betrayed
our mother-daughter bond,

16
00:00:43,077 --> 00:00:45,077
that I am taking the battery.

17
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:46,645
Mother?

18
00:00:46,647 --> 00:00:47,980
I don't believe you.

19
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:52,151
Yeah, I feel the resemblance.

20
00:00:52,153 --> 00:00:53,919
Young lady,
you give me that right now!

21
00:00:53,921 --> 00:00:55,721
No, Mother!
Not after what you did.

22
00:00:55,723 --> 00:00:57,222
This battery's mine!

23
00:00:57,224 --> 00:00:58,991
Not that you care about that.

24
00:00:58,993 --> 00:01:01,226
Just what is that
supposed to mean?

25
00:01:01,228 --> 00:01:03,495
You know exactly what it means.

26
00:01:03,497 --> 00:01:05,431
Juniper, cut the sass
and give me the battery!

27
00:01:05,433 --> 00:01:06,765
Never!

28
00:01:12,373 --> 00:01:15,841
but you do realize there's
another battery right there.

29
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:18,744
Ha!

30
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,747
This is not how I raised you
to steal things!

31
00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:25,217
I'm my own
crime-dancer now, Mother!

32
00:01:26,754 --> 00:01:27,920
It'll do for now.

33
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:33,325
I should call my mom.

34
00:01:35,361 --> 00:01:37,696
Hello, I am Baymax.

35
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,266
<i>♪ Whoa-oh</i>

36
00:01:42,969 --> 00:01:44,136

Bad news, San Fransokyo.

41
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:09,428
Infamous mother-daughter duo,
High Voltage,

42
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:10,829
<i>broke danced</i>
<i>out of jail</i>

43
00:02:10,831 --> 00:02:12,965
<i>and are making</i>
<i>a crime-dance comeback.</i>

44
00:02:12,967 --> 00:02:14,733
I get the crime.

45
00:02:14,735 --> 00:02:16,301
I don't get the dance.

46
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:18,504
See, I get the dance.

47
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:20,973
I don't get the crime.

48
00:02:20,975 --> 00:02:22,608
Let's just get them
back in jail.

49
00:02:23,744 --> 00:02:25,177
Guys, Richardson Mole.

50
00:02:25,179 --> 00:02:26,745
He can't know that we're--

51
00:02:26,747 --> 00:02:29,481
-Big Hero 6.
-What about Big Hero 6?

52
00:02:30,117 --> 00:02:34,419
Because if there's
something you want to know
about Big Hero 6,

53
00:02:34,421 --> 00:02:35,821
I'm the one to ask.

54
00:02:35,823 --> 00:02:37,189
I'm kind of an expert.

55
00:02:37,191 --> 00:02:38,357
Right.

56
00:02:38,359 --> 00:02:41,460
I see I piqued
your interest, Dream Girl.

57
00:02:41,462 --> 00:02:43,795
I'm not just a superhero expert.

58
00:02:43,797 --> 00:02:45,164
I know villains too.

59
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:46,331
High Voltage, Glooby--

60
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:48,300
Globby! I mean, um-- I--

61
00:02:48,302 --> 00:02:51,036
I mean, I believe
it is pronounced "Globby."

62
00:02:51,038 --> 00:02:54,339
Stay in your lane, Fred!
It's definitely Glooby.

63
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:55,974
Uh, no, it's not.

64
00:02:55,976 --> 00:02:57,342
The man's a giant glob.

65
00:02:57,344 --> 00:02:59,845
Thus, his name is Glob-by.

66
00:02:59,847 --> 00:03:01,446
He's not a giant "gloob."

67
00:03:01,448 --> 00:03:03,182
You don't know what
you're talking about.

68
00:03:03,184 --> 00:03:05,717
Oh, I know exactly
what I'm talking about.

69
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:07,452
-No, you don't!
-Yes, I do!

70
00:03:07,454 --> 00:03:09,521
You're ruining
my lunch serenity, guys.

71
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:11,823
Yeah, move along, Richardson.

72
00:03:11,825 --> 00:03:13,559
This is my side of town.

73
00:03:13,561 --> 00:03:14,693
You have sides?

74
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:16,295
Not for long.

75
00:03:16,297 --> 00:03:17,896
I'm buying
the lot next door.

76
00:03:17,898 --> 00:03:19,565
It will soon be home

77
00:03:19,567 --> 00:03:22,334
to the Mole Museum
of Superhero History.

78
00:03:22,336 --> 00:03:24,903
A superhero museum?
That was my idea!

79
00:03:24,905 --> 00:03:26,705
-Was not!
-Uh-huh!

80
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:28,473
Stop. Just stop.

81
00:03:28,475 --> 00:03:31,210
Sure, anything
for you, Dream Girl.

82
00:03:31,212 --> 00:03:32,444
I wouldn't.

83
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:34,413
Some day.

84
00:03:34,415 --> 00:03:36,215
Ugh!

85
00:03:36,217 --> 00:03:37,482
I hate that kid.

86
00:03:37,484 --> 00:03:40,319
Yeah, you really shouldn't
let him get to you, Freddie.

87
00:03:40,321 --> 00:03:43,088
He's just trolling you.
Do not engage.

88
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:51,697
Hi there.

89
00:03:51,699 --> 00:03:53,332
Ma'am, you can't be in here.

90
00:03:53,334 --> 00:03:54,700
I'm so sorry
to bother you, officer,

91
00:03:54,702 --> 00:03:57,703
but my little ol' GPS here,
well, it just conked out,

92
00:03:57,705 --> 00:03:59,171
and I'm all turned around.

93
00:03:59,173 --> 00:04:00,572
Could you be a sweetheart
and point me

94
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:01,773
in the right direction?

95
00:04:01,775 --> 00:04:03,709
Uh, okay.
Where you trying to go?

96
00:04:03,711 --> 00:04:06,678
Well, thank you, darling.
I'm trying to get...

97
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:10,616
...here.

98
00:04:17,557 --> 00:04:19,191
Got it.

99
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:22,694
Come to...

100
00:04:24,031 --> 00:04:26,298
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no!

101
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,567
Having a bad day?

102
00:04:28,569 --> 00:04:30,836
Too bad. Because it's about
to get worse.

103
00:04:33,807 --> 00:04:36,074
Who's having a bad day now?

104
00:04:36,076 --> 00:04:37,476
Still you!

105
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:42,614
And me.

106
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:51,790
Yeah. Sorry about that.
Buh-bye!

107
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:54,159
Great. High Voltage got away.

108
00:04:54,161 --> 00:04:56,662
Well, technically half
of High Voltage got away,

109
00:04:56,664 --> 00:04:58,797
since they're clearly not
working together anymore.

110
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:01,433
So maybe we should
call her Half Voltage or--

111
00:05:01,435 --> 00:05:02,501
Ooh, ooh, I got it--

112
00:05:02,503 --> 00:05:05,304
Low Voltage. Eh? Eh?

113
00:05:05,306 --> 00:05:06,938
-Right?
-Look.

114
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,173
- It's empty.
- Huh.

115
00:05:08,175 --> 00:05:11,310
Why would Low Voltage--
going with that name--

116
00:05:11,312 --> 00:05:13,078
want an empty box?

117
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,180
She didn't want the box, Fred.

118
00:05:15,182 --> 00:05:17,582
She wanted whatever
was in the box.

119
00:05:17,584 --> 00:05:18,984
Their energy orb.

120
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:21,019
Ah. Interesting theory,
Go Go.

121
00:05:21,021 --> 00:05:23,322
This requires research.

122
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:27,526
The mother-daughter
supervillain section is so vast.

123
00:05:27,528 --> 00:05:29,194
Uh, here to start.

124
00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:33,665
What do you want?

125
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:35,534
Just wanted to make sure
you weren't soiling

126
00:05:35,536 --> 00:05:37,269
my comics
with your finger dirt.

127
00:05:37,271 --> 00:05:39,671
Yeah. Well, I wish
you weren't soiling

128
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:41,306
my life with your face.

129
00:05:41,308 --> 00:05:43,508
Oh, witty retort. Not!

130
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:46,178
What? No! You cannot mock
with a "not!"

131
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,512
That's just-- Wait.

132
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:48,814
What is this?

133
00:05:48,816 --> 00:05:50,182
What does it look like?

134
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:54,720
Wait, "Lizard Guy"
isn't even my-- his name!

135
00:05:54,722 --> 00:05:56,154
Yes, it is!
For your information,

136
00:05:56,156 --> 00:05:58,523
I am a close,
personal friend
of Big Hero 6.

137
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:00,892
-No way!
-Or yes way.

138
00:06:00,894 --> 00:06:02,527
We hang out all the time.

139
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:04,730
Brunch, kayaking.

140
00:06:04,732 --> 00:06:06,798
Last weekend,
we went apple picking.

141
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,367
It was delightful!

142
00:06:08,369 --> 00:06:10,802
That is a bushel
of lies, Richardson!

143
00:06:10,804 --> 00:06:11,903
I know Big Hero 6,

144
00:06:11,905 --> 00:06:13,805
and they would never
pick fruit with you.

145
00:06:13,807 --> 00:06:15,807
-Ever!
-Oh, please.

146
00:06:15,809 --> 00:06:18,377
There's no way
you know Big Hero 6.

147
00:06:18,379 --> 00:06:21,179
They're big-time superheroes,
and you're just a big...

148
00:06:22,249 --> 00:06:24,516
...old...

149
00:06:24,518 --> 00:06:25,517
...nobody.

150
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:30,856
I definitely know Big Hero 6
because I am Lizard Guy!

151
00:06:30,858 --> 00:06:34,159
Except that's not my name!
It's Fredzilla, baby.

152
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:36,661
Fake.

153
00:06:36,663 --> 00:06:38,663
Yeah, I guess
this is fake too?

154
00:06:42,268 --> 00:06:43,635
Ha!

155
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:47,005
Oh!

156
00:06:47,007 --> 00:06:48,673
Uh... Uh...

157
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,947
Forget you saw that!

158
00:06:59,385 --> 00:07:00,619
Oh, no.

159
00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:15,767
Oh, no.
He's eating crackers.

160
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:16,935
This is bad.

161
00:07:20,406 --> 00:07:21,740
I detect heightened stress.

162
00:07:21,742 --> 00:07:25,243
Indicated by cortisol
and crackers.

163
00:07:25,245 --> 00:07:27,546
-What's with the crackers?
-He's a guilt eater.

164
00:07:27,548 --> 00:07:28,814
What did you do?

165
00:07:30,983 --> 00:07:33,385
I told Richardson that
I'm a member of Big Hero 6!

166
00:07:33,387 --> 00:07:36,488
Ah! Crackers on my face!
Crackers on my face!

167
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:37,956
Wait. You what?

168
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:40,625
I know. I'm sorry. I broke
superhero rule number one.

169
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:42,227
I'm a disgrace,
and I deserve to be punished.

170
00:07:45,898 --> 00:07:48,133
I don't deserve
a cushion, Baymax.

171
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:51,636
Wait, wait, wait. Fred, what
exactly does Richardson know?

172
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:53,638
Oh, I know a lot of things.

173
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,641
If Fred's in Big Hero 6,
that means so are you.

174
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:58,009
You. You.

175
00:07:58,011 --> 00:07:59,511
-You.
-Hello.

176
00:07:59,513 --> 00:08:01,012
And you.

177
00:08:01,014 --> 00:08:02,781
Dream Girl...

178
00:08:02,783 --> 00:08:03,615
just got dreamier.

179
00:08:03,617 --> 00:08:05,584
Ugh. Dream on.

180
00:08:05,586 --> 00:08:08,353
Yeah, we're not--

181
00:08:08,355 --> 00:08:09,955
You're not going
to tell anybody, right?

182
00:08:09,957 --> 00:08:11,690
If people knew,
it would be dangerous.

183
00:08:11,692 --> 00:08:13,859
"If people knew,
it would be dangerous."

184
00:08:13,861 --> 00:08:15,994
Seriously, Richardson,
you have to keep it a secret.

185
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:18,263
Sure, sure, a secret.

186
00:08:18,265 --> 00:08:19,898
My lips are sealed.

187
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:23,134
-But...
-I knew there'd be a but!

188
00:08:23,136 --> 00:08:25,504
-I want something in return.
-What?

189
00:08:25,506 --> 00:08:27,506
To go on a date with--

190
00:08:27,508 --> 00:08:29,140
No way. Not happening.

191
00:08:29,142 --> 00:08:30,742
Go ahead. Tell everyone.

192
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:34,179
Fine. It was worth a try.

193
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:37,682
-But...
-Ooh, I knew
there'd be another but!

194
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:39,985
Oh, there are
a lot more buts, Fred.

195
00:08:39,987 --> 00:08:42,821
"I want Fred's first edition
of   <i>The Human Fist,</i>

196
00:08:42,823 --> 00:08:44,856
"his entire
Captain Fancy collection,

197
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:48,560
and his limited edition
Dr. Slaughter action figure."

198
00:08:48,562 --> 00:08:49,694
No way! You can't--

199
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:50,729
-Done.
-Fine.

200
00:08:50,731 --> 00:08:51,863
-Take it.
-Okay.

201
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:52,731
Wait, what?

202
00:08:52,733 --> 00:08:54,833
Okay. You can have
all of Fred's stuff

203
00:08:54,835 --> 00:08:57,002
as long as you keep
our identities a secret.

204
00:08:57,004 --> 00:08:58,136
- Wait!
- Goodbye.

205
00:08:58,138 --> 00:08:59,237
No wait, Fred.

206
00:08:59,239 --> 00:09:01,406
You make a mess,
you clean it up.

207
00:09:01,408 --> 00:09:04,609
I hate when you're right!

208
00:09:15,923 --> 00:09:17,556
Hello, Juniper.

209
00:09:17,558 --> 00:09:20,559
Don't "Hello, Juniper" me.
Where is it?

210
00:09:20,561 --> 00:09:23,194
I don't know
what you're talking about.

211
00:09:23,196 --> 00:09:25,130
Tell me where it is. Now!

212
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:29,100
You wanna dance?

213
00:09:30,836 --> 00:09:32,003
Ah!

214
00:09:32,005 --> 00:09:33,505
<i>♪ You might think I'm done</i>

215
00:09:33,507 --> 00:09:34,573
Let's dance.

216
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:40,879
I think that song's
a little tired, don't you?

217
00:09:44,551 --> 00:09:47,218
<i>♪ You choke up on the phone</i>

218
00:09:49,856 --> 00:09:51,957
<i>♪ You end up all alone</i>

219
00:09:56,562 --> 00:09:57,862
It's a classic!

220
00:09:57,864 --> 00:10:00,765
Classic's just another word
for old, Mother!

221
00:10:02,569 --> 00:10:04,869
Did you just call me old?

222
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:07,739
Hey!

223
00:10:07,741 --> 00:10:09,307
Mind your own business, buddy!

224
00:10:09,309 --> 00:10:11,643
This is my business!
I'm Joe!

225
00:10:12,878 --> 00:10:14,379
If you think for one minute

226
00:10:14,381 --> 00:10:15,947
that I won't get to it
before you,

227
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:18,283
then you're wrong.
So wrong!

228
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:20,952
It's cute that
you think so, little girl.

229
00:10:32,431 --> 00:10:33,832
What a mess.

230
00:10:33,834 --> 00:10:36,234
But what a performance.

231
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:40,839
Mmm.

232
00:10:43,176 --> 00:10:44,843
Release attention.

233
00:10:44,845 --> 00:10:47,445
All right, Richardson.
You got everything you wanted.

234
00:10:47,447 --> 00:10:48,747
Now just leave us alone.

235
00:10:48,749 --> 00:10:50,682
Actually, I thought
of something else I want.

236
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:53,685
I want to be one of you.

237
00:10:53,687 --> 00:10:55,587
What?

238
00:10:55,589 --> 00:10:57,455
A member of Big Hero 6.

239
00:10:57,457 --> 00:10:58,823
-What?
-Bad idea.

240
00:10:58,825 --> 00:10:59,824
-Uh-uh.
-Nope.

241
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:01,192
Ha-ha. No.

242
00:11:01,194 --> 00:11:03,695
Fine.

243
00:11:03,697 --> 00:11:06,097
Wait, what is he doing?
Who is he calling?

244
00:11:06,099 --> 00:11:07,832
Hey, Bluff,

245
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:08,967
Richardson Mole here.

246
00:11:08,969 --> 00:11:11,036
Yeah, I've got
a big scoop for you.

247
00:11:11,038 --> 00:11:12,971
I know the real identities of--

248
00:11:17,711 --> 00:11:19,611
Yeah, sorry about that, Bluff.
I got cut--

249
00:11:25,452 --> 00:11:26,951
Hey, Bluff--

250
00:11:26,953 --> 00:11:28,186
Yeah, sorry about that--

251
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:29,320
Richardson Mole here--

252
00:11:29,322 --> 00:11:31,389
Okay, fine.
I'll make you a battle suit.

253
00:11:31,391 --> 00:11:32,957
That's what I thought.

254
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:36,061
Hiro, no. You can't make Mole
a battle suit.

255
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:37,062
I don't have a choice.

256
00:11:37,064 --> 00:11:39,564
People can't know
who we really are.

257
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,900
What power do you want?

258
00:11:41,902 --> 00:11:44,402
Hmm? I want to breathe fire.

259
00:11:44,404 --> 00:11:45,704
But that's my thing!

260
00:11:45,706 --> 00:11:47,972
Yeah, well, I think
I can do it better.

261
00:11:49,576 --> 00:11:50,875
- Cracker?
- Thank you!

262
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:58,316
Check it out, everybody.

263
00:11:58,318 --> 00:12:00,185
Much better than Fred's suit,

264
00:12:00,187 --> 00:12:03,054
thanks to a few changes
I dictated to Hiro.

265
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:04,823
-I changed the color story...
-Uh-huh.

266
00:12:04,825 --> 00:12:06,925
...increased the force and
trajectory of the fire blast,

267
00:12:06,927 --> 00:12:09,828
and I added cup holders.

268
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:11,096
Whatever, mine's still--

269
00:12:13,265 --> 00:12:15,066
Should have thought
of cup holders.

270
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:17,435
Oh-ho-ho.
Mole power punch!

271
00:12:18,438 --> 00:12:21,072
Hyah! Ho!

272
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:24,209
I am awesome.

273
00:12:24,211 --> 00:12:26,111
Battle cry!

274
00:12:26,113 --> 00:12:29,914
Just be careful, okay.
It's a powerful suit and--

275
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:33,184
Please. If Fred can do this,
I can certainly do it.

276
00:12:33,186 --> 00:12:35,186
- Fire blast!
- Richardson, no!

277
00:12:44,697 --> 00:12:46,197
Not the topiaries!

278
00:12:47,566 --> 00:12:49,434
Fire.
Please step back.

279
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:52,403
Okay, that's it--

280
00:12:52,405 --> 00:12:53,438
High Voltage.

281
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,806
- We've got to suit up.
- Yes!

282
00:12:54,808 --> 00:12:57,041
My first superhero mission!

283
00:12:57,043 --> 00:12:59,410
We are Big Hero 7!

284
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:07,786
How you doing
back there, Richardson?

285
00:13:07,788 --> 00:13:09,554
This is really high!

286
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:11,456
Right there!

287
00:13:17,663 --> 00:13:19,063
Wasabi, you see her?

288
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:21,533
Yep.

289
00:13:37,917 --> 00:13:39,684
Nuh-uh. No buttons.

290
00:13:43,924 --> 00:13:45,123

00:14:55,661 --> 00:14:57,061
Guess they made up.

312
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:04,602
Or not.

313
00:15:04,604 --> 00:15:07,272
I thought I told you
to stay out of my way.

314
00:15:07,274 --> 00:15:10,174
You also told me to make my bed,
and I didn't do that, either!

315
00:15:16,515 --> 00:15:17,749
Got it!

316
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:26,024
Oh, no, you don't!

317
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:28,860
- Comic book store!
- My store?

318
00:15:28,862 --> 00:15:30,295
Why are they going in there?

319
00:15:30,297 --> 00:15:32,297
I don't know. But we still have
a lot of problems out here.

320
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,034
Fred and I are on it.

321
00:15:38,904 --> 00:15:40,405
All right. Be cool, okay.

322
00:15:40,407 --> 00:15:42,307
Out of my way.

323
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:45,643
Who would do
such a horrible thing?

324
00:15:46,645 --> 00:15:48,980
Villains, that's who.

325
00:15:48,982 --> 00:15:50,782
Filthy villains!

326
00:15:51,984 --> 00:15:54,319
-Wait, I don't like you.
-I don't like you either!

327
00:15:54,321 --> 00:15:57,255
Boys, focus.

328
00:15:57,257 --> 00:15:58,623
We need to find High Voltage.

329
00:16:00,893 --> 00:16:01,960
The Mole Hole.

330
00:16:05,764 --> 00:16:07,999
Oh, no, you don't.

331
00:16:08,001 --> 00:16:10,969
Juniper, give me
the orb right now!

332
00:16:10,971 --> 00:16:14,138
After the way
you betrayed me! Never!

333
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,306
Ha!

334
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:16,841
Ha!

335
00:16:16,843 --> 00:16:18,409
Guess we know
what they're looking for.

336
00:16:18,411 --> 00:16:20,745
Hey, Go Go,
you were right. Wait--

337
00:16:20,747 --> 00:16:23,114
- Why do you have that?
- For the museum!

338
00:16:23,116 --> 00:16:24,215
Obvi!

339
00:16:25,451 --> 00:16:27,218
I will not ask you again.

340
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:33,758
And I will never
trust you again!

341
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,894
That move is mine.
You stole it!

342
00:16:56,115 --> 00:16:59,851
Gotta be honest, your tap
is a little sloppy, ladies.

343
00:16:59,853 --> 00:17:01,953
Richardson!

344
00:17:01,955 --> 00:17:04,989
Never insult the bad guys
in an enclosed space.

345
00:17:04,991 --> 00:17:07,692
Especially you.
Shuffle-hop-step?

346
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:09,494
More like shuffle-hot-mess.

347
00:17:09,496 --> 00:17:11,129
For your information,

348
00:17:11,131 --> 00:17:12,997
the move is called
the "Power Surge,"

349
00:17:12,999 --> 00:17:15,533
and Juniper does it perfectly.

350
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:19,537
Whoa!

351
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:24,742
Oh! That could have been me.

352
00:17:24,744 --> 00:17:26,277
Yeah. So stay down.

353
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,214
You really think
I do it perfectly?

354
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:32,116
Of course I do.

355
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:36,554
But then, why did you steal it?

356
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:39,190
Because... I can't do
my move anymore.

357
00:17:39,192 --> 00:17:41,426
My extension just isn't
what it used to be.

358
00:17:41,428 --> 00:17:43,594
Aww, you could
have just told me.

359
00:17:43,596 --> 00:17:45,363
I was embarrassed.

360
00:17:45,365 --> 00:17:48,866
And I thought you wouldn't want
to crime-dance with me anymore.

361
00:17:51,336 --> 00:17:54,338
But we're a team.

362
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:56,841
Every move I have,
I learned from you!

363
00:17:57,576 --> 00:18:00,511
Oh, come here.

364
00:18:01,847 --> 00:18:04,315
I love you, Mom.

365
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:06,984
I love you too.

366
00:18:09,289 --> 00:18:12,423

<i>♪ Forever together...</i>

370
00:18:19,999 --> 00:18:24,702
That's why I think it's time
we got the team back together.

371
00:18:28,474 --> 00:18:30,741
<i>♪ Let's get our acts together</i>

372
00:18:30,743 --> 00:18:32,643

377
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:42,787
What are you doing?

378
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:44,455
Not... crying.

379
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:46,557
Get it together.
We need a plan.

380
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:48,559
They're charging up
to full power with that thing.

381
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:51,729
I've got an idea.

382
00:18:51,731 --> 00:18:53,564
Um, what are you thinking?

383
00:18:53,566 --> 00:18:55,833
Cut them off from the orb.

384
00:18:55,835 --> 00:18:57,335
-Ah.
-Ready?

385
00:18:57,337 --> 00:18:58,503
Ready!

386
00:18:59,338 --> 00:19:01,739
Together, we're High Voltage!

387
00:19:01,741 --> 00:19:03,007
Power Surge!

<i>♪ High Voltage</i>

392
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:21,826
You probably should've kept
these as backup.

393
00:19:21,828 --> 00:19:24,028
Oh, Mom, are we
going back to jail?

394
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:26,097
At least we'll be
together, baby.

395
00:19:27,032 --> 00:19:28,466
Woman up.

396
00:19:37,976 --> 00:19:39,243
Fred, wait!

397
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:42,313
What now, Richardson?

398
00:19:42,315 --> 00:19:45,183
I just wanted to say thank you.

399
00:19:45,185 --> 00:19:46,551
For saving me.

400
00:19:47,953 --> 00:19:49,820
You've never been nice to me.

401
00:19:49,822 --> 00:19:53,291
I'm not sure what
I'm supposed to do here.

402
00:19:53,293 --> 00:19:54,559
Ugh, don't make it awkward.

403
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:02,466
Okay. You're welcome.

404
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:05,970
Ah.

405
00:20:07,173 --> 00:20:08,472
Does this mean you're going
to keep our secret?

406
00:20:10,577 --> 00:20:13,377
No way. I'm totally
going public with this.

407
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:15,413
I've already got
an exclusive interview tomorrow

408
00:20:15,415 --> 00:20:17,315
with <i>Good Morning,</i>
<i>San Fransokyo.</i>

409
00:20:17,317 --> 00:20:20,284
Now if you don't mind, I'll be
taking the orb to my new museum.

410
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:22,553
Richardson, don't!

411
00:20:39,938 --> 00:20:41,172
Hello.

412
00:20:41,174 --> 00:20:43,207
On a scale of one to ten,

413
00:20:43,209 --> 00:20:44,542
how would you rate your pain?

414
00:20:44,544 --> 00:20:46,010
I'm not in any pain.

415
00:20:46,778 --> 00:20:48,246
Why are you guys here?

416
00:20:48,248 --> 00:20:50,014
High Voltage attacked
your store...

417
00:20:50,016 --> 00:20:51,782
Wait, was Big Hero 6 here?

418
00:20:51,784 --> 00:20:53,017
W-W-Where are they?

419
00:20:53,019 --> 00:20:55,253
-You don't remember?
-Remember what?

420
00:20:55,255 --> 00:20:58,289
Fred revealed to you that
we are all members of Big--

421
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:00,558
Uh-- Uh-- Big, uh--
Big nothing.

422
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,827
One big nothing!

423
00:21:05,564 --> 00:21:07,531
He doesn't remember.

424
00:21:07,533 --> 00:21:10,201
Perhaps the unique
nature of the orb's power

425
00:21:10,203 --> 00:21:11,435
caused memory loss.

426
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:13,104
Okey-dokey,
let's go with that.

427
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:17,875
Hey, buddy.
Need a hand?

428
00:21:17,877 --> 00:21:19,977
Pfft. Not from you, loser.

429
00:21:19,979 --> 00:21:21,879
Excuse me, but I just--

430
00:21:21,881 --> 00:21:24,448
Staying calm.

431
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:28,552
- You just what?
- Do not engage.

432
00:21:28,554 --> 00:21:29,453
Do not engage.

433
00:21:30,555 --> 00:21:32,189
Anyone have any crackers?
