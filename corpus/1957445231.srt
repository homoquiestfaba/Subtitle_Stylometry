00:01:13,791 --> 00:01:17,394
Hello, my name is Ethan Hawke,
and I just wanted to talk to you briefly

3
00:01:17,427 --> 00:01:18,763
about the new film
I'm working on

4
00:01:18,796 --> 00:01:21,666
called <i>Zeros and Ones,</i>
by Abel Ferrara.

5
00:01:21,699 --> 00:01:25,603
I've been a fan of Abel since I
first fell in love with the movies.

6
00:01:25,637 --> 00:01:28,773
He's a completely unique
and extraordinary filmmaker.

7
00:01:28,806 --> 00:01:33,243
He's got voice with the camera.
He has depth with his actors.

8
00:01:33,276 --> 00:01:37,749
The work that he's done most recently with
Willem Dafoe has been wildly inspiring to me,

9
00:01:37,782 --> 00:01:40,283
so I was very grateful
to get the script.

10
00:01:40,317 --> 00:01:44,656
Especially considering that the
script speaks to this moment.

11
00:01:44,689 --> 00:01:48,191
Not in any obvious,
uh, didactic way,

12
00:01:48,225 --> 00:01:51,963
but you can feel
that this is Abel's hit

13
00:01:51,996 --> 00:01:55,767
on what we've all been going
through for the last year or so.

14
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:59,971
Uh, it's a beautiful script.
I play a military man.

15
00:02:00,004 --> 00:02:03,407
You're not exactly sure whether
I'm a good guy or a bad guy,

16
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:06,476
and I also play my own brother,
who's a revolutionary.

17
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:09,781
And so, that's very dynamic
for me to get to play

18
00:02:09,814 --> 00:02:13,383
these two characters that are
representing contrasting viewpoints.

19
00:02:13,417 --> 00:02:15,586
I think we're gonna be able
to do something really special.

20
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:19,289
Uh, I consider the most
important aspect of my job,

21
00:02:19,322 --> 00:02:21,726
who I choose to work with,
that's what actors do.

22
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:25,897
You know, we champion filmmakers,
uh, we champion voices.

23
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:29,533
And I'm excited for the world
to see Abel's response

24
00:02:29,567 --> 00:02:32,804
to-to this wild year
we've been living through.

25
00:02:32,837 --> 00:02:34,404
I hope you enjoy it.

to kill a man.

Yeah, is that what you think?

Your fear made me,
and now, here I am.

141
00:29:38,462 --> 00:29:44,001
I am your enemy, but your enemy
won't be gone when you kill me.

142
00:29:45,536 --> 00:29:47,171
You can't kill me.

143
00:29:48,906 --> 00:29:53,177
Try it, watch what happens.

144
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:57,414
I'll be right back after the
sound and the fury is finished.

I'll meet you there.

And you?

160

You're dead already.

themselves on fire, eh?!

This country
was conceived in liberty,

165
00:30:56,140 --> 00:31:01,646
dedicated to the proposition
that all men are created equal.

166
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:04,682
This is a battleground.

167
00:31:04,716 --> 00:31:07,985
The world is watching
what happens here,

168
00:31:08,018 --> 00:31:12,523
and it is up to us,
the living...

169
00:31:12,557 --> 00:31:15,325
to finish the work of the dead

170
00:31:15,359 --> 00:31:18,128
so they will
not have died in vain

171
00:31:18,162 --> 00:31:20,964
and that a government
of the people, for the people,

172
00:31:20,998 --> 00:31:24,101
by the people, shall not perish
from this earth!

'cause he-he got it, he got it.

<i>They're coming, man.
Get the fuck out of there!</i>

358
01:02:08,212 --> 01:02:10,214
<i>Go! Go, man, come on!</i>

359
01:02:10,247 --> 01:02:12,950
<i>Move! Move! Go! Go! Go!</i>

360
01:02:12,983 --> 01:02:15,052
<i>Get the fuck out of there, man!</i>

361
01:02:15,085 --> 01:02:17,454
<i>They're coming, man!
Go! Go! Go!</i>

362
01:02:18,188 --> 01:02:19,957
<i>Go! Go!</i>

363
01:02:19,990 --> 01:02:22,594
<i>Motherfucking cocksucker!</i>

364
01:02:22,627 --> 01:02:25,329
<i>You fucking cocksuckin'
motherfucker!</i>

365
01:02:25,362 --> 01:02:26,997
<i>Fuckin' piece of shit!</i>

366
01:02:32,036 --> 01:02:33,170
[man] Hey!

367
01:02:36,574 --> 01:02:39,143
[intense snare drum beat]

368
01:02:58,095 --> 01:03:00,097

01:05:27,645 --> 01:05:29,614
[whirring]

370
01:05:55,239 --> 01:05:59,142
[JJ] <i>The world
is the hiding place of God.</i>

371
01:06:01,378 --> 01:06:05,516
<i>You know who said that?
Jesus.</i>

372
01:06:09,553 --> 01:06:12,422
<i>To understand
what's outside of you,</i>

373
01:06:12,456 --> 01:06:14,792
<i>you must use what's in you.</i>

374
01:06:20,497 --> 01:06:25,703
<i>If we hear only what we already
know, nothing new happens.</i>

375
01:06:44,822 --> 01:06:48,626
<i>The hard road
leads to a real life.</i>

376
01:06:56,668 --> 01:06:59,436
<i>"I have done
what is mine to do.</i>

377
01:07:01,806 --> 01:07:04,174
<i>Do what is yours to do,"</i>

378
01:07:06,376 --> 01:07:08,478
<i>the dying words
of Saint Francis.</i>

379
01:07:48,218 --> 01:07:50,788
[phone ringing]

380
01:08:08,238 --> 01:08:09,306
For you.

381
01:08:12,442 --> 01:08:15,412
<i>Being out of uniform
in a war zone</i>

382
01:08:15,445 --> 01:08:18,382
<i>is a crime punishable by death.</i>

383
01:08:18,415 --> 01:08:20,183
[laughing]

384
01:08:34,297 --> 01:08:36,668
[laughing continues]

385
01:08:36,701 --> 01:08:43,641
<i>Listen, soldier, convening with
the enemy is a serious offense.</i>

386
01:08:44,876 --> 01:08:46,711
<i>Can you understand that?</i>

387
01:08:53,651 --> 01:08:55,385
<i>When?</i>

388
01:08:55,419 --> 01:08:56,453
<i>When?</i>

389
01:09:03,995 --> 01:09:06,798
[Phil] <i>Did you plan on
keeping this to yourself?</i>

390
01:09:31,689 --> 01:09:33,658
Have you talked to Steven?

391
01:09:35,026 --> 01:09:36,894
<i>You just got him killed.</i>

392
01:09:44,836 --> 01:09:46,470
[JJ] Where's my brother?

393
01:09:49,907 --> 01:09:51,843
<i>Your brother was an anarchist.</i>

394
01:09:53,811 --> 01:09:56,681
<i>Your brother was a communist.</i>

395
01:09:57,849 --> 01:10:00,250
[laughing]

396
01:10:05,890 --> 01:10:08,025
My brother
was a revolutionary.

397
01:10:15,867 --> 01:10:18,669
- We gotta get out of here.
- Where?

398
01:10:20,470 --> 01:10:21,906
New York?

399
01:10:56,607 --> 01:10:57,909
Shit.

400
01:11:03,681 --> 01:11:08,518
[stairs clanking]

401
01:11:08,552 --> 01:11:11,622
[intense music playing]

402
01:11:22,633 --> 01:11:23,734
When?

403
01:11:26,503 --> 01:11:27,805
Right now.

404
01:11:30,007 --> 01:11:31,541
Get the baby.

405
01:12:10,581 --> 01:12:11,782
It's on.

406
01:12:13,483 --> 01:12:15,019
Thank God.

407
01:12:49,854 --> 01:12:52,455
[intense drum beat playing]

408
01:13:07,838 --> 01:13:09,840
[indistinct shouting]

409
01:13:46,844 --> 01:13:48,913
[birds squawking]

410
01:15:14,865 --> 01:15:17,802
[vehicle approaching]

411
01:15:25,076 --> 01:15:27,778
[peaceful guitar music playing]

412
01:16:23,334 --> 01:16:25,436
[children playing]

413
01:16:25,469 --> 01:16:28,973
[peaceful music continues]

414
01:16:41,318 --> 01:16:43,354
[no audible dialogue]

415
01:18:26,123 --> 01:18:29,159
Well, the movie's over.

416
01:18:30,394 --> 01:18:35,332
Uh, when I first
spoke to you, um,

417
01:18:35,366 --> 01:18:37,401
I was really
just recording a video

418
01:18:37,434 --> 01:18:40,104
to help raise money
to make the movie.

419
01:18:40,137 --> 01:18:44,041
And now, uh,
we've made the film!

420
01:18:44,074 --> 01:18:48,245
And I just watched it,
and you just watched it.

421
01:19:06,598 --> 01:19:09,967
When Abel gave me the script
and, uh...

422
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:16,340
script is a really, uh,
not accurate term for what he sent.

423
01:19:18,309 --> 01:19:20,377
I really didn't understand
a word of it...

424
01:19:20,411 --> 01:19:22,112
Yeah.

425
01:19:22,146 --> 01:19:24,948
But I really liked it.
[soft chuckle]

426
01:19:24,982 --> 01:19:29,621
Uh, I did, but I didn't know
what was happening.

427
01:19:29,654 --> 01:19:33,324
I felt like somebody
was up to something,

428
01:19:33,357 --> 01:19:35,392
and that I wanted to be
a part of it,

429
01:19:35,426 --> 01:19:37,995
but I didn't know
what he was trying to say.

430
01:19:42,232 --> 01:19:45,603
And now,
after watching the film,

431
01:19:45,637 --> 01:19:51,609
I think what I began to feel
while we're making it is true.

432
01:19:51,643 --> 01:19:53,477
Which is that you're...

433
01:19:53,510 --> 01:20:00,117
You can have kind of two
opposing outlooks on the world

434
01:20:00,150 --> 01:20:02,654
and that they're both accurate.

435
01:20:02,687 --> 01:20:05,322
You kind of can
align your shoulders one way

436
01:20:05,356 --> 01:20:08,359
in which you realize you wake up
in the morning and you think,

437
01:20:09,426 --> 01:20:12,496
"Oh, shit, I'm gonna die.

438
01:20:12,529 --> 01:20:16,033
I mean, this is real.
I'm gonna die."

439
01:20:16,066 --> 01:20:19,136
And the world is run

440
01:20:19,169 --> 01:20:24,908
by corrupt, greedy individuals

441
01:20:24,942 --> 01:20:29,246
and there's great tragedy
and disease

442
01:20:29,279 --> 01:20:32,383
and the planet is eroding.

443
01:20:32,416 --> 01:20:36,621
And not only am I gonna die,
everybody I know is gonna die.

444
01:20:36,654 --> 01:20:40,391
And brothers lie to each other,
and people hurt each other.

445
01:20:40,424 --> 01:20:46,497
And you just... you just don't know if you
can go on, or what the point of it all is.

446
01:20:46,530 --> 01:20:52,002
And then almost
with-with the same ease,

447
01:20:52,035 --> 01:20:56,173
you can align your shoulders
a different direction and go,

448
01:20:56,206 --> 01:21:02,079
"I was born! Why was I born?
I'm so glad I was born.

449
01:21:02,112 --> 01:21:07,217
Everybody was born,
and the sun comes up and there're flowers.

450
01:21:07,251 --> 01:21:10,588
And guess what,
a lot of people are really nice!"

451
01:21:10,622 --> 01:21:13,725
And there's a kind of
pervasive kindness and healing

452
01:21:13,758 --> 01:21:19,463
that runs through the world
as it spins away.

453
01:21:19,496 --> 01:21:22,667
And there's all this
tremendous beauty!

454
01:21:22,700 --> 01:21:26,470
Every child is a miracle

455
01:21:26,503 --> 01:21:30,007
and I wonder why I was born,
you know.

456
01:21:30,040 --> 01:21:31,475
What I'm doing.

457
01:21:31,508 --> 01:21:36,346
Both those outlooks
are a hundred percent true.

458
01:21:48,358 --> 01:21:51,495
This is part of the movie,
by the way.

459
01:21:51,528 --> 01:21:53,063
And now it's over.
