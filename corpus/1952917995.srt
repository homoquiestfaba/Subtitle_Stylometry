00:01:58,165 --> 00:02:00,360
I just missed your heart.

2
00:02:29,095 --> 00:02:30,460
You're dead.

3
00:02:30,697 --> 00:02:32,062
Right now.

4
00:02:32,799 --> 00:02:34,391
I've killed you.

5
00:02:46,546 --> 00:02:48,207
Use your hands!

6
00:03:05,465 --> 00:03:07,797
Drag that deer back yourself.

7
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,731
What's wrong?

8
00:04:15,368 --> 00:04:16,699
Are you hurt?

9
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:18,962
You were half asleep.

10
00:04:19,506 --> 00:04:21,235
You must always be ready.

11
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:23,502
Even when you're sleeping.

12
00:04:24,077 --> 00:04:25,669
Think on your feet.

13
00:04:25,779 --> 00:04:26,803
Adapt...

14
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,939
Or die.
I'll do better next time.

18
00:04:51,905 --> 00:04:53,770
How much did you
pull off the deer?

19
00:04:54,874 --> 00:04:56,899
120 with scraps.

20
00:04:57,377 --> 00:04:59,277
200 pounds in total.

21
00:04:59,779 --> 00:05:01,110
I think so.

22
00:05:01,581 --> 00:05:03,071
That explains it.

23
00:05:04,517 --> 00:05:05,541
What?

24
00:05:05,852 --> 00:05:07,376
How you beat me.

25
00:05:08,421 --> 00:05:10,082
You're getting strong.

right here.

It was so beautiful.

63
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:09,187
It tells Marissa Wiegler
where we are.

64
00:10:11,658 --> 00:10:14,058
If you think you're ready
and you want to leave here,

65
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:16,626
all you have to do
is flip that switch.

But once it's done,
there's no going back.

67

I won't be there

100
00:13:57,316 --> 00:13:59,147
You were lucky
you caught that deer.

101
00:13:59,752 --> 00:14:01,982
There was nothing
out there today.

102

104
00:14:16,903 --> 00:14:18,268
Soon.

105
00:15:10,723 --> 00:15:12,953
We picked up an unencrypted

00:15:13,025 --> 00:15:14,583
When?
0632 Eastern Standard.

107
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:17,993
Triangulated about 60 miles below
the Arctic Circle. Near Kuusamo.

108
00:15:18,231 --> 00:15:19,289

Erik Heller?

110
00:15:20,433 --> 00:15:21,627
You were

111
00:15:21,701 --> 00:15:22,827
Sure. Name sounds familiar.

112
00:15:32,111 --> 00:15:33,601
Fuck, Erik.

113
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,947

115
00:15:47,627 --> 00:15:48,958
Good.

116
00:15:53,499 --> 00:15:54,591
Almost good.

122
00:16:05,444 --> 00:16:08,277
And there was no sign of
life until April 18th, 1996

123
00:16:08,347 --> 00:16:11,248
when his fingerprints were
found on a. 22 caliber Luger

124

found beside the body
of one Johanna Zadeck.

125
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:17,112
Johanna Zadeck.
Born 1970. German.

126
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:20,623
She was spotted and developed by
Heller in 1994. Never recruited.

127
00:16:20,693 --> 00:16:22,058
Why was she being developed?

128
00:16:22,128 --> 00:16:23,686
That's not in the file.
Let's keep on task.

129
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:27,055
Heller is a rogue asset. I
propose we go in and pull him out.

130
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:30,234
We've got bigger problems,
Marissa. Let Interpol pick him up.

131
00:16:30,303 --> 00:16:31,634
He's no longer
our responsibility.

132
00:16:31,837 --> 00:16:35,295
Interpol nabs him, then
exposes him to BND, FSB, France.

133
00:16:35,374 --> 00:16:37,365
Do you really want

Where is she now?

178
00:20:05,351 --> 00:20:06,682
Hello, Hanna.

179
00:20:07,686 --> 00:20:08,778
Hello.

180
00:20:09,021 --> 00:20:12,684
My name's Dr. Burton. Would
you like to talk to me?

181
00:20:14,026 --> 00:20:17,018
I was told by my father
to gain the upper hand.

182
00:20:17,229 --> 00:20:19,220
That's very interesting.

183
00:20:19,632 --> 00:20:21,725
What else did
your father tell you?

184
00:20:23,469 --> 00:20:24,902
Where am I?

185
00:20:25,104 --> 00:20:26,628
You're in holding.

186
00:20:27,439 --> 00:20:29,737
I’ve never been
in a room like this.

187
00:20:29,942 --> 00:20:32,376
It must all be
very strange for you.

188
00:20:32,444 --> 00:20:34,969
How long have you
been in the forest?

189
00:20:40,119 --> 00:20:41,381
Hanna?

190
00:20:47,793 --> 00:20:48,953
Are those cameras?

191
00:20:49,028 --> 00:20:50,086
Uh-huh.

192
00:20:50,829 --> 00:20:52,820
They're taking our
picture right now.

193
00:20:53,132 --> 00:20:54,565
To keep a record.

194
00:20:54,733 --> 00:20:56,394
How does that make you feel?

195
00:20:57,036 --> 00:20:58,469
Camera obscura.

196
00:20:59,505 --> 00:21:00,904
It’s Latin for
"dark chamber. ' '

197
00:21:02,107 --> 00:21:06,874
<i>It was first described by the Arabic
scientist Ibn Alhazen in the year 1021.</i>

198
00:21:07,446 --> 00:21:09,914
Plug the CCTV
through to Langley.

199
00:21:12,117 --> 00:21:13,982
<i>Yeah, you should have visual
on the psych evaluation now.</i>

200
00:21:14,053 --> 00:21:15,213
<i>Can I get you something?</i>

201
00:21:15,521 --> 00:21:18,149
<i>What do you like?
Music? Magazines?</i>

202
00:21:18,691 --> 00:21:21,125
Just ask. Anything at all.

203
00:21:22,795 --> 00:21:24,786
I want to speak
to Marissa Wiegler.

204
00:21:26,932 --> 00:21:28,126
Tell her
I’ll be there tonight.

205
00:21:28,267 --> 00:21:29,325
I can handle this.

206
00:21:29,468 --> 00:21:31,402
Just do what you're told.

207
00:21:36,875 --> 00:21:39,605
John, take a look at
this kid's blood sample.

208
00:21:40,212 --> 00:21:41,236
Is that right?

209
00:21:41,313 --> 00:21:43,247
Is it?
Can't be right.

210
00:21:43,315 --> 00:21:45,146
I got a sample of her hair.

211
00:21:45,484 --> 00:21:46,849
Must be contaminated.

212
00:21:47,052 --> 00:21:48,383
Run it again.

213
00:22:15,147 --> 00:22:17,377
My name
is Marissa Wiegler.

214
00:22:18,884 --> 00:22:20,977
You wanted to
speak with me?

215
00:22:28,727 --> 00:22:30,490
You can wait outside.

216
00:22:36,835 --> 00:22:38,166
Where am I?

217
00:22:38,504 --> 00:22:40,836
You're in
a safe place, sweetie.

218
00:22:43,075 --> 00:22:45,168
Where did you
meet my father?

219
00:22:46,378 --> 00:22:47,367
Erik.

220
00:22:48,013 --> 00:22:49,207
You mean Erik?

221
00:22:51,784 --> 00:22:52,842
Yes.

222
00:22:53,318 --> 00:22:57,084
I met him by a news kiosk in
Alexanderplatz, East Berlin.

223
00:22:58,023 --> 00:23:00,150
I met him at a news kiosk.

224
00:23:01,193 --> 00:23:02,717
Alexanderplatz.

225
00:23:02,928 --> 00:23:03,917
<i>Say it was raining.</i>

226
00:23:03,996 --> 00:23:04,985
In the rain.

227
00:23:05,631 --> 00:23:07,565
<i>He had just
arrived from Prague.</i>

228
00:23:07,933 --> 00:23:09,764
Just arrived from Prague.

229
00:23:09,935 --> 00:23:12,495
He had just
arrived from Prague.

230
00:23:19,211 --> 00:23:20,974
Do you know
where your father is?

231
00:23:22,581 --> 00:23:24,708
Did he tell you
where he was going?

232
00:23:26,118 --> 00:23:28,382
<i>We're all worried
about him.</i>

233
00:23:30,989 --> 00:23:32,650
It’s okay.

234
00:23:34,927 --> 00:23:36,394
Agent, keep your distance.

235
00:23:37,096 --> 00:23:38,427
It’s okay.

236
00:23:39,832 --> 00:23:41,163
It’s okay.

237
00:23:43,168 --> 00:23:44,601
<i>You want me
to give her something?</i>

238
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:46,697
I think that
might be necessary.

239
00:23:48,674 --> 00:23:49,698
Abort.

240
00:23:52,845 --> 00:23:54,073
Open up.

241
00:23:54,279 --> 00:23:56,110
I repeat, Agent, abort.

242
00:24:13,999 --> 00:24:15,933
Oh, my!

243
00:24:20,205 --> 00:24:21,297
<i>Wiegler!</i>

244
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:29,272
<i>Wiegler!</i>

245
00:24:46,365 --> 00:24:48,230
Target is in sector 3.

246
00:24:48,467 --> 00:24:50,264
Shut it down! Shut it down!

247
00:26:07,412 --> 00:26:09,209
Lord, help me.

248
00:27:20,385 --> 00:27:23,445
You think she got out?
She can't get out!

249
00:27:26,191 --> 00:27:27,556
<i>Who's on the perimeter?</i>

250
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:30,961
<i>Detail every unit available.</i>

251
00:30:40,085 --> 00:30:41,074
<i>Mama!</i>

252
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:37,061
She will never be yours.

253
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:58,282
<i>She will never be yours.</i>

254
00:33:36,828 --> 00:33:38,022
Hey.

255
00:33:38,229 --> 00:33:39,560
Hello?

256
00:33:39,864 --> 00:33:41,126
Don't you speak English?

257
00:33:42,734 --> 00:33:44,531
It’s not your fault
if you can't.

258
00:33:44,869 --> 00:33:47,133
MIA couldn't speak English
until she was 8

259
00:33:47,539 --> 00:33:50,508
because she was, like, a refugee
or something from Sri Lanka.

260
00:33:50,675 --> 00:33:52,939
And now she's a pop star.
In America, too.

261
00:33:53,178 --> 00:33:55,237
So don't worry if you
can't speak English yet.

262
00:33:55,313 --> 00:33:56,371
Who's she?

263
00:33:56,514 --> 00:33:59,972
I found her. She can't speak
English. She's from Sri Lanka.

264
00:34:00,051 --> 00:34:01,780
I’m from Germany.

265
00:34:02,754 --> 00:34:03,743
Oh.

266
00:34:04,556 --> 00:34:07,616
I live in Leipzig. Population
0.7 million peoples.

267
00:34:07,759 --> 00:34:09,624
We live at number
7 Weissingerplatz.

268
00:34:09,694 --> 00:34:12,720
I like literature and sport, in
particular tennis and athletics.

269
00:34:12,797 --> 00:34:14,958
I go to school at
the Klaus Kohle Gymnasium,

270
00:34:15,033 --> 00:34:17,399
and my best friends are Rudi
Gunther and Clara Schliess.

271
00:34:18,103 --> 00:34:19,195
They sound fun.

272
00:34:19,838 --> 00:34:21,328
I also have
a dog called Trudi.

273
00:34:21,406 --> 00:34:22,873
We had a dog
called Vincent.

274
00:34:23,074 --> 00:34:24,735
But he went mad and died.

275
00:34:32,951 --> 00:34:34,145
Sophie!

276
00:34:34,452 --> 00:34:35,885
Sophie!

277
00:34:36,087 --> 00:34:37,418
See you.

278
00:34:37,622 --> 00:34:39,783
Sophie! Come on!

279
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:57,365
I’m Sophie, and that's
my brother, Miles.

280
00:34:58,443 --> 00:35:00,308
I’m Hanna.

281
00:35:00,979 --> 00:35:03,004
Do you need
a lift somewhere?

282
00:35:04,182 --> 00:35:06,650
No. I prefer to walk.

283
00:35:07,752 --> 00:35:09,242
Suit yourself.

284
00:35:13,425 --> 00:35:16,258
Sophie, come on.
We're all waiting for you.

285
00:35:18,696 --> 00:35:20,960
<i>Tactical says she's in the
desert southeast of Essaouira.</i>

286
00:35:21,032 --> 00:35:22,260
Focus all operations
on Heller.

287
00:35:22,801 --> 00:35:24,769
<i>Are you saying the girl
is not of interest to us?</i>

288
00:35:24,836 --> 00:35:26,098
<i>Yes, of course,
she's of interest, Lewis,</i>

289
00:35:26,171 --> 00:35:28,139
<i>but not an immediate
threat to the security</i>

290
00:35:28,206 --> 00:35:30,140
<i>of the United
States of America.</i>

291
00:35:30,208 --> 00:35:33,541
Erik Heller is the immediate
threat. Focus on Heller.

292
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:53,674
Where is your family?

293
00:37:53,751 --> 00:37:54,740
Are you Arab?

294
00:37:55,186 --> 00:37:56,847
I’m Moroccan.

295
00:37:57,322 --> 00:37:58,755
Morocco.

296
00:37:58,957 --> 00:38:02,791
Capital city: Rabat. Places of
interest: Marrakech, Essaouira.

297
00:38:02,994 --> 00:38:04,962
Religion: Islam.
Language: Arabic.

298
00:41:19,624 --> 00:41:20,682
It’s the German girl!

299
00:41:20,892 --> 00:41:22,257
Is "Kraut" an ethnic slur?

300
00:41:23,027 --> 00:41:24,494
Like "queer" or "lesbo"?

301
00:41:24,695 --> 00:41:26,390
I think I'd quite
like to be a lesbian.

302
00:41:26,631 --> 00:41:27,893
But not one
of those fat ones.

303
00:41:27,965 --> 00:41:29,660
One who's, like,
a supermodel.

304
00:41:29,734 --> 00:41:32,862
But we'd only hold hands, and I
think I'd probably marry a man.

305
00:41:33,371 --> 00:41:34,668
What?

306
00:42:19,951 --> 00:42:20,975
No kiss?

307
00:42:21,052 --> 00:42:23,577
She's a bit old
for you, isn't she?

308
00:42:23,788 --> 00:42:26,222
She has male and
female genialitas.

309
00:42:26,424 --> 00:42:28,858
And you love her
just the way she is.

310
00:42:29,126 --> 00:42:30,616
I like to give people
what they want.

311
00:42:35,299 --> 00:42:36,994
I’ll save it
for when I need it.

312
00:42:38,769 --> 00:42:39,963
What do you want, Marissa?

313
00:42:40,872 --> 00:42:42,703
Erik Heller is still alive.

314
00:42:42,907 --> 00:42:44,374
Of course.

315
00:42:44,508 --> 00:42:45,497
And the girl.

316
00:42:46,377 --> 00:42:47,366
Ah.

317
00:42:48,579 --> 00:42:50,911
Why are you here?
Be concise.

318
00:42:51,115 --> 00:42:52,480
I need you.

319
00:42:52,750 --> 00:42:56,186
You need me? Little old
me? I’m very flattered.

320
00:42:56,254 --> 00:42:58,779
I need your
talents, darling.

321
00:42:58,990 --> 00:43:02,050
I need you to do things
my agency will not let me do.

322
00:43:13,070 --> 00:43:16,062
The devil is in
the details, isn't he?

323
00:43:19,143 --> 00:43:20,576
It’s the girl or Erik?

324
00:43:20,745 --> 00:43:23,111
She's in Morocco.
It’s all in the envelope.

325
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:24,704
Let me worry about Erik.

326
00:43:26,150 --> 00:43:27,742
Shall I kill her?

327
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:30,285
Just find her.

328
00:43:33,557 --> 00:43:34,546
Marissa.

329
00:43:37,295 --> 00:43:39,160
Did she turn out
as you hoped?

330
00:43:41,165 --> 00:43:42,496
Better.

331
00:43:51,342 --> 00:43:53,902
She was married to this footballer
and gave him lots of advice

332
00:43:53,978 --> 00:43:56,606
about how to spend his money
and do his tax.

333
00:43:56,681 --> 00:43:58,012
'Cause even though
she's beautiful,

334
00:43:58,082 --> 00:43:59,379
she's actually
brilliant with money.

335
00:43:59,450 --> 00:44:01,577
Get off! Like,
for their anniversary,

336
00:44:01,652 --> 00:44:03,381
he said,
"Here's 15 grand

337
00:44:03,454 --> 00:44:05,149
"toward a Hermes Kelly bag
or a boob job. ' '

338
00:44:05,222 --> 00:44:07,315
Now, she said she knew
the boob implants

339
00:44:07,391 --> 00:44:09,450
would have to be replaced
every 10 years,

340
00:44:09,527 --> 00:44:12,052
but that the Hermes Kelly bag
never depreciates in value.

341
00:44:12,129 --> 00:44:14,222
That's enough with the boob
jobs. That's just common sense.

342
00:44:14,298 --> 00:44:15,731
That's why
everybody loves her.

343
00:44:16,567 --> 00:44:17,864
Mum is against
plastic surgery.

344
00:44:17,935 --> 00:44:18,924
I am.

345
00:44:19,003 --> 00:44:20,595
Mum doesn't even
wear makeup.

346
00:44:20,671 --> 00:44:22,832
I don't.
I think it's dishonest.

347
00:44:23,007 --> 00:44:24,599
This is my face.
Take it or leave it.

348
00:44:25,076 --> 00:44:27,601
If you study history of
art or anthropology...

349
00:44:27,678 --> 00:44:29,077
Rachel got her
first at Cambridge.

350
00:44:29,146 --> 00:44:31,046
...you learn that red
lipstick mimics arousal

351
00:44:31,115 --> 00:44:32,776
and suggests the geography
of the labia minora.

352
00:44:32,850 --> 00:44:33,839
Puke!

353
00:44:33,918 --> 00:44:35,715
Whereas, I have a lot of
natural red pigment in my lips

354
00:44:35,786 --> 00:44:36,878
so I really don't need it.

355
00:44:36,954 --> 00:44:38,080
Vomitorium!
Soph...

356
00:44:38,155 --> 00:44:39,986
It’s embarrassing!
Just grow up, all right?

357
00:44:40,057 --> 00:44:41,046
Grow up?
Yeah.

358
00:44:41,125 --> 00:44:42,353
Oh, because yesterday
Mum was saying

359
00:44:42,426 --> 00:44:43,586
I shouldn't act
beyond my years.

360
00:44:43,661 --> 00:44:45,526
It does leave her with
mixed messages, darling.

361
00:44:45,596 --> 00:44:48,030
Because we're trying to communicate
to her how to enjoy childhood.

362
00:44:48,099 --> 00:44:50,590
I just want her to stop saying
"vomitorium. " All right?

363
00:44:50,701 --> 00:44:52,225
Oy, it's not funny.

364
00:44:57,742 --> 00:44:59,767
So, Hanna... Hanna?

365
00:45:00,044 --> 00:45:02,035
I’m quite impressed about you
traveling around on your own.

366
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:04,945
My father encourages me
to be independent.

367
00:45:05,516 --> 00:45:06,778
You see,
that's wonderful.

368
00:45:06,851 --> 00:45:08,716
I was backpacking at your
age. Where is he? Your father?

369
00:45:08,786 --> 00:45:12,278
I spent a heavenly summer just
island hopping around Greece...

370
00:45:12,356 --> 00:45:14,586
Bed hopping around Greece.

371
00:45:15,126 --> 00:45:17,390
What? No, it's valuable.

372
00:45:17,461 --> 00:45:20,259
Our experience makes us who
we are. Isn't that right, kids?

373
00:45:22,533 --> 00:45:25,525
So, Hanna, is your mum
and dad still together?

374
00:45:26,203 --> 00:45:27,693
My mother is dead.

375
00:45:28,172 --> 00:45:29,366
Nice one, Dad.

376
00:45:29,607 --> 00:45:32,838
I’m sorry to hear that. I lost my
mum when I was very young. So...

377
00:45:33,044 --> 00:45:36,275
It’s all right.
It happened a long time ago.

378
00:45:36,447 --> 00:45:37,971
Hanna,

379
00:45:38,182 --> 00:45:40,343
what did your mum die of?

380
00:45:40,584 --> 00:45:41,573
Three bullets.

381
00:45:42,787 --> 00:45:44,880
Oh, my God,
that's appalling.

382
00:45:54,698 --> 00:45:56,996
"A combination of sounds,

383
00:45:57,201 --> 00:45:59,795
"with a view
to beauty of form

384
00:46:01,072 --> 00:46:03,302
"and expression of emotion. ' '

385
00:46:12,383 --> 00:46:13,782
"Abnormal. ' '

386
00:46:24,161 --> 00:46:25,822
What happens
if it rains?

387
00:46:25,896 --> 00:46:27,295
Well, you're gonna get wet, aren't you?

388
00:46:27,364 --> 00:46:29,025
Because someone
broke the sunroof

389
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:30,226
and seeing as me
and your mother are...

390
00:46:30,301 --> 00:46:31,359
"Your mother and I.' '

391
00:46:31,435 --> 00:46:32,959
Seeing as me and your mother,
your mother and I,

392
00:46:33,037 --> 00:46:34,868
are responsible adults,
it leaves you two.

393
00:46:34,939 --> 00:46:37,840
My fungal nail
infection's back.

394
00:46:37,908 --> 00:46:39,773
Is there gonna be a swimming
pool where we're going?

395
00:46:39,844 --> 00:46:41,709
Yeah, there'll be a swimming pool. Yes!

396
00:46:41,779 --> 00:46:43,508
Yes, there will be. Have
you packed up the bags?

397
00:46:43,581 --> 00:46:45,344
I don't
understand why VIP means

398
00:46:45,416 --> 00:46:47,281
after the illegal
immigrants and the goats.

399
00:47:28,959 --> 00:47:30,950
Brilliant.
Absolutely brilliant.

400
00:47:31,162 --> 00:47:34,393
Let's play "shut up"
for 20 seconds, everyone.

401
00:49:03,854 --> 00:49:04,843
Yeah!

402
00:49:13,664 --> 00:49:15,291
Go, go, go!

403
00:49:27,278 --> 00:49:28,267
Shh.

404
00:49:41,925 --> 00:49:42,983
I’ve contacted Interpol.

405
00:49:43,060 --> 00:49:44,084
On whose authority?

406
00:49:44,161 --> 00:49:46,527
Walt. We can't keep this
to ourselves anymore.

407
00:49:46,730 --> 00:49:47,958
Were you not listening?

408
00:49:48,032 --> 00:49:49,624
He killed 2 policemen.

409
00:49:49,833 --> 00:49:52,597
He's reframed the situation.
It is out of our control.

410
00:49:52,670 --> 00:49:55,264
Then we must
regain control, Mr. Lewis.

411
00:49:55,472 --> 00:49:57,667
I am the first
and the last person

412
00:49:57,741 --> 00:49:59,868
Erik Heller will see.
Are we clear?

413
00:50:02,713 --> 00:50:05,307
Are we clear, Mr. Lewis?

414
00:50:05,382 --> 00:50:06,371
Yes, ma'am.

415
00:52:07,104 --> 00:52:09,231
Oh, my God!
What are you doing here?

416
00:52:11,074 --> 00:52:13,702
The sunroof. Was it you?

417
00:52:13,977 --> 00:52:15,205
Would it be
very bad if it was?

418
00:52:15,279 --> 00:52:18,043
You mean, you were in
the van the whole time?

419
00:52:18,849 --> 00:52:20,714
My dad would have a heart
attack if he found out.

420
00:52:21,051 --> 00:52:22,678
Will you have to tell him?

421
00:52:22,753 --> 00:52:24,311
Hanna! You are so mental.

422
00:52:24,521 --> 00:52:26,421
Of course, I’m not
going to tell him.

423
00:52:26,557 --> 00:52:27,581
I think it's brilliant.

424
00:52:28,425 --> 00:52:30,052
Have you got
anywhere to stay?

425
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:31,284
No.

426
00:52:31,361 --> 00:52:32,885
Yes, you do.
You're staying with me.

427
00:52:32,963 --> 00:52:33,987
I am?

428
00:52:34,164 --> 00:52:35,324
Yeah, obviously.

429
00:52:35,432 --> 00:52:37,229
I’m sneaking you in
on one condition.

430
00:52:37,701 --> 00:52:38,725
What?

431
00:52:38,869 --> 00:52:40,166
These boys.

432
00:52:40,370 --> 00:52:41,837
Spanish.

433
00:52:41,939 --> 00:52:43,031
Gorgeous.

434
00:52:44,208 --> 00:52:45,368
No, don't look.

435
00:52:45,442 --> 00:52:47,672
They're not all preeny
about it like footballers.

436
00:52:47,744 --> 00:52:50,542
Haven't got their
eyebrows waxed or anything.

437
00:52:50,914 --> 00:52:51,938
Good.

438
00:52:52,015 --> 00:52:54,609
Anyway, I’m meeting them
tonight, and you have to come.

439
00:52:54,685 --> 00:52:55,709
All right.

440
00:52:55,786 --> 00:52:57,310
God, you're not
hard to convince. Ho.

441
00:52:57,788 --> 00:52:58,846
Ho?

442
00:53:00,591 --> 00:53:01,751
Got anything to wear?

443
00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:06,258
You can't wear those. You
look like some mad German.

444
00:53:16,139 --> 00:53:17,436
Are you scared?

445
00:53:17,641 --> 00:53:19,108
Of what?

446
00:56:09,746 --> 00:56:11,976
Are we going to kiss now?

447
00:56:15,052 --> 00:56:16,713
Would you like to?

448
00:56:21,091 --> 00:56:24,993
Kissing requires a total
of 34 facial muscles

449
00:56:25,228 --> 00:56:27,992
and 112 postural muscles.

450
00:56:29,466 --> 00:56:33,027
The most important muscle involved
is the orbicularis oris muscle

451
00:56:33,503 --> 00:56:36,734
because it is used
to pucker the lips.

452
00:56:54,424 --> 00:56:55,857
Hanna, you mentalist!

453
00:56:56,093 --> 00:56:59,221
Please, tell your friend
I just wanted a kiss.

454
00:56:59,830 --> 00:57:01,161
Hanna!

455
00:57:01,598 --> 00:57:02,622
Should I let him go?

456
00:57:02,699 --> 00:57:06,294
As opposed to what?
Yes, you should let him go!

457
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:12,374
I’m going to go now.

458
00:57:13,043 --> 00:57:14,374
Okay.

459
00:57:15,445 --> 00:57:16,935
It was nice.

460
00:57:52,549 --> 00:57:54,517
Sophie? Is that you?

461
00:58:17,340 --> 00:58:20,673
Oh, my God, they're at it like
rabbits. That's so embarrassing.

462
00:58:20,744 --> 00:58:21,733
At what?

463
00:58:21,812 --> 00:58:23,507
I can't believe you.

464
00:58:38,962 --> 00:58:40,657
<i>Hello, Mama.</i>

465
00:58:40,931 --> 00:58:43,991
<i>I know you're disappointed
in me. I know it.</i>

466
00:58:45,135 --> 00:58:47,069
<i>I’m so sorry, Mama.</i>

467
00:58:47,270 --> 00:58:48,396
<i>But...</i>

468
00:58:48,772 --> 00:58:51,468
<i>But maybe I have found
a way to make it better.</i>

469
00:58:52,409 --> 00:58:54,570
<i>I’m in a program now,</i>

470
00:58:54,778 --> 00:58:57,406
<i>a program to make
babies stronger.</i>

471
00:58:58,081 --> 00:59:00,777
<i>It’s an American program.
Very scientific...</i>

472
01:00:32,575 --> 01:00:34,065
Hanna.

473
01:00:48,091 --> 01:00:49,422
Hanna?

474
01:00:49,859 --> 01:00:50,917
Yes?

475
01:00:51,027 --> 01:00:53,018
Where do you
really come from?

476
01:00:54,264 --> 01:00:55,697
Leipzig.

477
01:00:55,966 --> 01:00:57,263
I live in Leipzig.

478
01:00:57,467 --> 01:01:00,197
If we're going to be friends, you're
going to have to be honest with me.

479
01:01:00,270 --> 01:01:01,828
Them's the rules.

480
01:01:03,506 --> 01:01:04,495
Are we friends?

481
01:01:04,975 --> 01:01:07,409
Yes. I like you.

482
01:01:10,113 --> 01:01:12,138
I'd like to have a friend.

483
01:01:12,649 --> 01:01:15,584
I mean, you're a freak and
everything, but I like you.

484
01:01:16,886 --> 01:01:18,148
I like you, too.

485
01:01:18,922 --> 01:01:20,890
I really do,

486
01:01:22,225 --> 01:01:24,557
but there are things
I can't tell you.

487
01:01:25,061 --> 01:01:26,551
Do you understand?

488
01:01:26,763 --> 01:01:28,094
Yes.

489
01:01:29,933 --> 01:01:31,400
Actually, no, I don't.

490
01:01:32,736 --> 01:01:35,432
There are people
that want to harm me.

491
01:01:36,106 --> 01:01:37,232
Bad peoples.

492
01:01:37,307 --> 01:01:38,365
I see.

493
01:01:38,441 --> 01:01:39,601
And they won't stop.

494
01:01:40,110 --> 01:01:42,010
Right.

495
01:01:42,078 --> 01:01:43,943
So for your own safety...

496
01:01:47,751 --> 01:01:49,218
Can we still be friends?

497
01:01:49,986 --> 01:01:51,419
I don't know.

498
01:01:52,822 --> 01:01:55,120
I mean, I don't really
know who you are, do I?

499
01:01:55,592 --> 01:01:57,082
That's just it.

500
01:01:58,595 --> 01:02:00,153
Neither do I.

501
01:02:05,702 --> 01:02:06,691
What is it?

502
01:02:06,870 --> 01:02:08,804
It’s something about me.

503
01:02:10,006 --> 01:02:11,667
I know what DNA means,

504
01:02:12,609 --> 01:02:14,372
but I don't understand
the rest of it.

505
01:02:14,611 --> 01:02:15,873
Are you sick?

506
01:02:16,112 --> 01:02:17,340
I don't feel sick.

507
01:02:17,814 --> 01:02:19,008
What's wrong with you?

508
01:02:19,082 --> 01:02:20,777
Nothing's wrong with me.

509
01:02:22,619 --> 01:02:24,177
What are you going to do?

510
01:02:27,457 --> 01:02:29,516
I’m going to Berlin.

511
01:02:30,026 --> 01:02:32,790
I have to meet my father at
the house of Wilhelm Grimm.

512
01:02:32,996 --> 01:02:35,157
As in "Grimm's Fairytales"?

513
01:02:35,298 --> 01:02:36,322
That's right.

514
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:38,358
If you say so.

515
01:02:38,635 --> 01:02:40,569
Did I say
the wrong thing again?

516
01:02:48,511 --> 01:02:50,138
Keep this.

517
01:02:50,213 --> 01:02:51,805
To remember me.

518
01:02:53,683 --> 01:02:56,174
It’s a friendship bracelet.

519
01:03:01,191 --> 01:03:02,715
Thank you.

520
01:03:42,866 --> 01:03:44,299
Where's Hanna?

521
01:03:44,534 --> 01:03:46,263
Wow, you look rough.
Do you want some tea?

522
01:03:46,402 --> 01:03:47,994
Had some. Who's Hanna?

523
01:03:48,071 --> 01:03:49,732
The girl we ate dinner
with in Morocco.

524
01:03:49,806 --> 01:03:52,400
She's here, or was. She
came out with me last night.

525
01:03:52,475 --> 01:03:54,568
How did she get here?
Is she with her father?

526
01:03:54,644 --> 01:03:56,111
No, she came on her own.

527
01:03:56,880 --> 01:03:57,938
What?

528
01:03:58,081 --> 01:04:00,914
Why don't you let other people
have their own style of parenting?

529
01:04:01,117 --> 01:04:02,846
He's promoting independence.

530
01:04:02,919 --> 01:04:04,910
She's like an orphan.
Call me conservative.

531
01:04:04,988 --> 01:04:06,285
You're inherently
conservative, darling.

532
01:04:06,356 --> 01:04:07,380
No, I’m not.

533
01:04:07,457 --> 01:04:08,788
I said we'd give her
a lift to Lille.

534
01:04:08,858 --> 01:04:10,120
We are going to Lille,
aren't we?

535
01:04:10,460 --> 01:04:12,587
I found breakfast.

536
01:04:13,163 --> 01:04:14,926
That's gross.

537
01:04:19,302 --> 01:04:21,770
Your mum was so stoned,
she'd have eaten anything.

538
01:06:47,550 --> 01:06:49,984
We've got him.
Picking up now.

539
01:07:16,913 --> 01:07:19,143
<i>Do you read me?
Do you read me?</i>

540
01:07:20,950 --> 01:07:22,383
<i>Do you read me?</i>

541
01:07:22,452 --> 01:07:25,319
<i>Bring him to Wiegler.
She will ID and interview.</i>

542
01:07:25,388 --> 01:07:26,446
Is that what she said?

543
01:07:26,656 --> 01:07:29,489
<i>Orders confirmed
with her 2 minutes ago.</i>

544
01:07:29,625 --> 01:07:30,956
Marissa.

545
01:07:31,294 --> 01:07:32,625
Damn her!

546
01:07:58,955 --> 01:08:02,288
I feel so grounded
in the countryside.

547
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:05,921
The city stifles me,

548
01:08:06,662 --> 01:08:10,029
emotionally,
creatively, spiritually.

549
01:08:11,367 --> 01:08:14,268
Places like this
bring us closer to God.

550
01:08:14,470 --> 01:08:15,698
God?

551
01:08:15,938 --> 01:08:18,634
Well, not in any
monotheistic sense.

552
01:08:18,875 --> 01:08:21,969
Buddha, Krishna,
the god within.

553
01:08:22,678 --> 01:08:24,805
Whatever you believe in.

554
01:08:28,618 --> 01:08:30,609
What do you
believe in, Hanna?

555
01:08:34,457 --> 01:08:36,220
Nothing.

556
01:08:45,234 --> 01:08:46,701
Everything all right?

557
01:08:50,072 --> 01:08:51,539
I think so.

558
01:09:22,705 --> 01:09:25,265
<i>I’m not sure if it's true
that the baby can hear me,</i>

559
01:09:25,842 --> 01:09:27,571
<i>but at night, I sing.</i>

560
01:09:27,910 --> 01:09:29,901
<i>I hope she hears me.</i>

561
01:09:30,279 --> 01:09:32,543
<i>Was it like this
for you, Mama?</i>

562
01:09:32,748 --> 01:09:35,444
<i>I think I know
what she looks like.</i>

563
01:09:35,685 --> 01:09:38,210
<i>I can see her
when I close my eyes.</i>

564
01:09:38,421 --> 01:09:40,787
<i>I can hear her inside me,</i>

565
01:09:41,524 --> 01:09:42,752
<i>moving.</i>

566
01:09:42,959 --> 01:09:44,392
<i>Is that silly?</i>

567
01:09:45,094 --> 01:09:46,959
<i>I think it's a girl.</i>

568
01:09:47,296 --> 01:09:48,695
<i>I hope so.</i>

569
01:09:51,267 --> 01:09:52,495
<i>Erik helped me
make these tapes.</i>

570
01:09:52,568 --> 01:09:53,557
What?

571
01:09:53,636 --> 01:09:55,160
<i>He says
he will get them to you.</i>

572
01:09:55,238 --> 01:09:56,466
For Christ's sakes, Lewis!

573
01:09:56,539 --> 01:09:58,200
<i>Hello, Marissa.</i>

574
01:10:00,276 --> 01:10:02,574
<i>I heard you were dead.</i>

575
01:10:02,778 --> 01:10:04,245
Did your little girl
tell you that?

576
01:10:04,814 --> 01:10:06,281
<i>Even though
he knows all about me...</i>

577
01:10:06,349 --> 01:10:07,543
<i>What are
you listening to?</i>

578
01:10:07,617 --> 01:10:08,606
Self-help.

579
01:10:09,719 --> 01:10:11,584
<i>Are you in need of help?</i>

580
01:10:12,321 --> 01:10:13,481
It’s good to hear you.

581
01:10:14,657 --> 01:10:17,148
I didn't imagine we'd have
the chance to talk.

582
01:10:17,226 --> 01:10:19,854
<i>You don't have her, do you?
You're not that good.</i>

583
01:10:19,929 --> 01:10:21,988
Oh, Erik,
you're such a flirt.

584
01:10:25,268 --> 01:10:26,394
Tech's on the way up.

585
01:10:26,469 --> 01:10:28,232
You were a good agent, Erik.

586
01:10:28,437 --> 01:10:31,338
Was sad to see you go dumb.

587
01:10:33,910 --> 01:10:35,104
What did I miss?

588
01:10:35,177 --> 01:10:38,169
<i>I couldn't do it anymore,
the things we did.</i>

589
01:10:39,649 --> 01:10:41,913
I’m sorry? With Johanna?

590
01:10:42,919 --> 01:10:44,477
<i>With all of them.</i>

591
01:10:44,854 --> 01:10:46,185
<i>With Hanna.</i>

592
01:10:47,023 --> 01:10:48,888
So why come back now?

593
01:10:50,059 --> 01:10:51,185
Tech guys.

594
01:10:51,260 --> 01:10:53,922
I asked you
a question, Erik.

595
01:10:56,432 --> 01:10:58,832
Erik, are you still there?

596
01:11:38,507 --> 01:11:40,566
Move. Get up.

597
01:12:10,172 --> 01:12:11,298
Shit!

598
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:13,203
Shit, shit, shit!

599
01:12:14,744 --> 01:12:16,143
Hanna, I think we're lost.

600
01:12:24,286 --> 01:12:25,310
I’m gonna have
to pull over.

601
01:12:25,388 --> 01:12:26,377
No. Don't.

602
01:12:26,455 --> 01:12:27,683
Can't see the map.

603
01:12:43,873 --> 01:12:46,239
Have we stopped?
I need to pee.

604
01:12:46,442 --> 01:12:48,876
I don't want you going
too far right now, love.

605
01:12:49,078 --> 01:12:50,670
I think you should stay
where you are, Sophie.

606
01:12:50,746 --> 01:12:51,906
Hanna, what's going on?

607
01:13:12,535 --> 01:13:13,763
Are we in Lille?

608
01:13:13,836 --> 01:13:15,565
No, we're not.
I don't know where we are.

609
01:13:15,638 --> 01:13:17,299
Whatever you do,

610
01:13:17,373 --> 01:13:18,704
don't follow me.

611
01:13:18,874 --> 01:13:20,637
Promise not to follow me.

612
01:13:20,910 --> 01:13:22,002
I promise.

613
01:13:32,521 --> 01:13:34,648
Thank you for
being my friend.

614
01:13:37,059 --> 01:13:38,185
Hanna!

615
01:14:15,998 --> 01:14:17,590
Titch!

616
01:15:20,763 --> 01:15:21,752
Hanna?

617
01:17:43,572 --> 01:17:45,039
Definitely odd.

618
01:17:45,207 --> 01:17:46,834
Disconnected.

619
01:17:47,376 --> 01:17:48,502
You know,

620
01:17:48,711 --> 01:17:51,111
I like to think I have
a rapport with kids.

621
01:17:51,480 --> 01:17:52,947
You know,
I get on with them.

622
01:17:54,550 --> 01:17:57,815
You know, sir, it's days like
these that I really hate my job.

623
01:17:57,886 --> 01:17:59,979
Yeah, I’m sure you do.

624
01:18:00,189 --> 01:18:02,783
This is very,
very difficult.

625
01:18:04,727 --> 01:18:07,457
But sometimes children
are bad people, too.

626
01:18:07,529 --> 01:18:08,655
Stop crying.

627
01:18:08,931 --> 01:18:10,159
I’m not telling you anything.

628
01:18:10,232 --> 01:18:11,426
Do you know this boy?

629
01:18:11,500 --> 01:18:13,195
No.
He knows you.

630
01:18:13,268 --> 01:18:15,634
Your friend is in
a lot of danger.

631
01:18:15,704 --> 01:18:17,331
I don't know anything.

632
01:18:18,073 --> 01:18:20,064
She said
she lived in Leipzig.

633
01:18:20,142 --> 01:18:21,632
She went to the
Klaus Kohle Gymnasium.

634
01:18:21,844 --> 01:18:23,471
Her friends
were Rudi and Gunther.

635
01:18:23,545 --> 01:18:26,105
She likes tennis, and
she has a dog named Trudi.

636
01:18:26,181 --> 01:18:27,205
She lied to you.

637
01:18:27,649 --> 01:18:28,877
Absolutely.

638
01:18:28,951 --> 01:18:32,250
She seemed lost, like
she needed taking care of.

639
01:18:32,588 --> 01:18:35,182
I’ve got something
to show you.

640
01:18:35,257 --> 01:18:36,383
A bit of mothering.

641
01:18:36,458 --> 01:18:37,516
This is Hanna's mother.

642
01:18:37,593 --> 01:18:39,254
Biological mother.

643
01:18:39,428 --> 01:18:41,828
Fifteen years ago,
she was shot to death

644
01:18:41,897 --> 01:18:44,058
by Hanna's father
on a camping trip.

645
01:18:46,001 --> 01:18:48,231
Don't you wanna see
what's inside?

646
01:18:50,706 --> 01:18:51,968
Say please.

647
01:18:52,041 --> 01:18:53,372
Please.

648
01:19:21,136 --> 01:19:22,933
You like her, don't you?

649
01:19:23,005 --> 01:19:25,803
It’s okay.
I won't tell anyone.

650
01:19:27,142 --> 01:19:28,905
She's very pretty.

651
01:19:29,478 --> 01:19:30,502
Where is she?

652
01:19:30,846 --> 01:19:32,211
You tell me.

653
01:19:32,347 --> 01:19:33,814
She in lots of trouble?

654
01:19:34,016 --> 01:19:37,816
The worst kind, sweetheart. Some
very bad men are looking for her,

655
01:19:37,886 --> 01:19:40,047
and I need to find her.
I want to protect her.

656
01:19:46,061 --> 01:19:47,858
Do you want Hanna
to get hurt?

657
01:19:48,997 --> 01:19:50,328
No.

658
01:19:51,333 --> 01:19:54,234
She's going to Berlin,
to Wilhelm Grimm's house,

659
01:19:55,170 --> 01:19:56,569
to meet her dad.

660
01:21:39,708 --> 01:21:42,142
Hanna! Hanna, Hanna, Hanna.

661
01:21:42,244 --> 01:21:44,075
Come. Come.

662
01:21:45,347 --> 01:21:46,336
This way.

663
01:21:51,987 --> 01:21:54,455
Been waiting
for you a long time.

664
01:21:55,857 --> 01:21:57,688
What has Erik
told you about me?

665
01:21:58,227 --> 01:22:00,695
Wilhelm Grimm's house.
Stephanstrasse 260.

666
01:22:00,862 --> 01:22:03,956
10559 Berlin, Germany.

667
01:22:04,700 --> 01:22:06,031
That's it?

668
01:22:06,668 --> 01:22:08,533
He didn't tell you

669
01:22:09,238 --> 01:22:10,967
about my magic?

670
01:22:26,521 --> 01:22:27,510
What day is it?

671
01:22:27,589 --> 01:22:28,578
It’s today, my dear.

672
01:22:29,057 --> 01:22:30,422
Come.

673
01:22:30,659 --> 01:22:31,990
Come.

674
01:22:43,939 --> 01:22:45,270
Sit.

675
01:22:45,707 --> 01:22:46,833
Sit.

676
01:22:48,410 --> 01:22:49,900
You're hungry.

677
01:22:57,786 --> 01:22:58,810
Waffles.

678
01:22:59,054 --> 01:23:00,078
May I have one?

679
01:23:00,188 --> 01:23:02,748
An egg? Of course.

680
01:23:04,192 --> 01:23:07,457
You can eat whatever
you want, my dear. My shoe.

681
01:23:08,864 --> 01:23:10,923
I almost forgot.

682
01:23:15,604 --> 01:23:16,935
Present.

683
01:23:19,207 --> 01:23:20,196
For me?

684
01:23:24,813 --> 01:23:26,246
You will need
a fresh photograph,

685
01:23:26,315 --> 01:23:27,714
but everything's
in order, yes.

686
01:23:28,050 --> 01:23:30,644
Why do I need a piece of
paper to tell me my name?

687
01:23:30,719 --> 01:23:34,018
Not you. Not you, my dear,
but everyone else.

688
01:23:34,089 --> 01:23:36,580
We need paper and computers

689
01:23:36,658 --> 01:23:40,492
so we don't have to ask people
their names or look them in the face.

690
01:23:44,266 --> 01:23:45,995
You have a good face.

691
01:23:46,501 --> 01:23:48,162
You look just
like your father.

692
01:23:49,304 --> 01:23:51,033
And you walk like him, too.

693
01:23:52,174 --> 01:23:53,664
I don't walk like that.

694
01:23:53,742 --> 01:23:56,404
Yes, you do.
You do, my dear.

695
01:24:03,418 --> 01:24:04,908
Did you know my mother, too?

696
01:24:07,122 --> 01:24:08,987
But of course.

697
01:24:09,925 --> 01:24:11,756
She was a singer.

698
01:24:12,627 --> 01:24:14,060
A wonderful singer.

699
01:24:16,198 --> 01:24:17,222
Do you sing?

700
01:24:18,834 --> 01:24:21,632
Papa...
Erik didn't teach me.

701
01:24:21,937 --> 01:24:23,802
Oh, you poor child.

702
01:24:24,106 --> 01:24:27,371
He has truly limited you
from all the wonderful things

703
01:24:27,542 --> 01:24:29,339
the world has to offer.

704
01:24:29,544 --> 01:24:31,569
No magic.

705
01:24:32,314 --> 01:24:34,145
No music.

706
01:25:02,377 --> 01:25:03,366
I’ll teach you.

707
01:25:08,483 --> 01:25:09,950
Is that him?

708
01:25:13,822 --> 01:25:16,757
Upstairs with you, my dear.
Quickly.

709
01:25:31,339 --> 01:25:34,706
The park is closed,
boys and girls.

710
01:25:39,915 --> 01:25:41,280
Where is Erik?

711
01:26:23,091 --> 01:26:24,888
He doesn't know much.

712
01:26:25,093 --> 01:26:26,924
Or he's a very good liar.

713
01:26:27,562 --> 01:26:28,586
He knew Johanna.

714
01:26:28,663 --> 01:26:29,652
Yes, of course.

715
01:26:29,898 --> 01:26:31,832
Bits and pieces
about the program.

716
01:26:32,067 --> 01:26:33,398
What does he know
about the girl?

717
01:26:33,602 --> 01:26:35,229
He thinks Erik's the father.

718
01:26:36,571 --> 01:26:38,163
Everybody thinks
Erik's her father.

719
01:26:38,240 --> 01:26:39,832
That's precious.

720
01:26:40,041 --> 01:26:41,668
Yes?

721
01:26:41,910 --> 01:26:43,036
This is Marissa Wiegler.

722
01:26:44,513 --> 01:26:45,741
Walt, I didn't...

723
01:26:45,814 --> 01:26:47,008
<i>Lewis is dead.</i>

724
01:26:47,349 --> 01:26:49,749
<i>You didn't think it would
be important to tell us?</i>

725
01:26:49,818 --> 01:26:50,978
<i>Why didn't you call it in?</i>

726
01:26:52,821 --> 01:26:54,755
<i>"One man, one day operation. "</i>

727
01:26:54,990 --> 01:26:57,117
<i>We trusted you with
a promising agent...</i>

728
01:26:57,325 --> 01:26:59,793
Yes, yes, yes,
we all loved Lewis.

729
01:26:59,961 --> 01:27:02,759
<i>And on top of that, you
left a crime scene, Agent.</i>

730
01:27:02,831 --> 01:27:04,696
He was shooting
through the door, Walt.

731
01:27:04,766 --> 01:27:06,825
<i>As of this minute,
you are to stand down.</i>

732
01:27:06,935 --> 01:27:09,631
No, I’m not standing down.

733
01:27:10,839 --> 01:27:12,773
No, I am inches...

734
01:27:13,108 --> 01:27:14,871
<i>Your career is on the line.</i>

735
01:27:15,844 --> 01:27:18,677
Well, yes. That is fine.

736
01:27:21,049 --> 01:27:22,107
No.

737
01:27:22,717 --> 01:27:23,741
Listen.

738
01:27:23,985 --> 01:27:24,974
Walt.

739
01:28:56,411 --> 01:28:58,242
Heizinger block.

740
01:29:15,830 --> 01:29:17,161
Hi, boss.

741
01:29:17,399 --> 01:29:19,890
So off to
Grandmother's house we go.

742
01:30:28,336 --> 01:30:29,667
Hanna!

743
01:30:44,052 --> 01:30:45,383
Sit down.

744
01:30:48,723 --> 01:30:50,452
Are you my father?

745
01:30:52,026 --> 01:30:53,015
Sit down, Hanna.

746
01:30:53,128 --> 01:30:54,152
Are you my father?

747
01:30:54,229 --> 01:30:55,321
Please, sit.

748
01:30:55,396 --> 01:30:56,624
Are you?

749
01:30:56,865 --> 01:30:57,991
Hanna.

750
01:30:58,299 --> 01:31:00,290
Of course I’m your father.

751
01:31:01,069 --> 01:31:02,161
I raised you.

752
01:31:02,237 --> 01:31:03,295
But Marissa said...

753
01:31:03,371 --> 01:31:04,395
Hanna!

754
01:31:04,472 --> 01:31:05,632
Don't lie to me.

755
01:31:07,041 --> 01:31:08,702
I am your father.

756
01:31:08,910 --> 01:31:10,935
I’ve been with you
your whole life.

757
01:31:11,279 --> 01:31:13,008
Treated you like you're
my own flesh and blood.

758
01:31:13,081 --> 01:31:15,379
But I’m not your
flesh and blood.

759
01:31:17,118 --> 01:31:18,915
I’m abnormal.
No!

760
01:31:18,987 --> 01:31:20,477
Where was I born?

761
01:31:24,325 --> 01:31:26,293
Tell me the truth.

762
01:31:28,696 --> 01:31:31,130
You were born
in a research facility

763
01:31:31,366 --> 01:31:33,266
in rural Poland. Galinka.

764
01:31:34,903 --> 01:31:36,768
What was the research?

765
01:31:37,272 --> 01:31:39,001
They took fertilized embryos

766
01:31:39,073 --> 01:31:41,268
and made small changes
to them to improve them.

767
01:31:41,643 --> 01:31:44,874
To reduce the capacity
for fear, for pity,

768
01:31:45,079 --> 01:31:48,207
to increase muscle strength,
heighten senses.

769
01:31:48,283 --> 01:31:50,911
Anything to make
a better soldier,

770
01:31:50,985 --> 01:31:52,452
the perfect soldier.

771
01:31:56,224 --> 01:31:58,385
I recruited your mother
at an abortion clinic.

772
01:31:59,294 --> 01:32:01,785
I recruited 20 women
the same way.

773
01:32:05,834 --> 01:32:07,597
There were other children?

774
01:32:07,802 --> 01:32:09,133
Yes.

775
01:32:10,104 --> 01:32:11,332
When you were two,

776
01:32:11,706 --> 01:32:14,197
Marissa Wiegler,
she closed the whole program.

777
01:32:14,275 --> 01:32:16,004
And all of this research,

778
01:32:17,478 --> 01:32:19,309
it was disposed of.

779
01:32:19,480 --> 01:32:20,504
Do you understand?

780
01:32:26,087 --> 01:32:27,850
I love you, Hanna.

781
01:32:28,256 --> 01:32:29,951
You have to know that.

782
01:32:33,027 --> 01:32:34,824
Because I’m a freak?

783
01:32:35,864 --> 01:32:37,195
No.

784
01:32:38,199 --> 01:32:40,099
Because you are my child.

785
01:32:48,376 --> 01:32:49,604
We're not finished here.

786
01:32:52,180 --> 01:32:53,511
Stop this!

787
01:32:53,715 --> 01:32:55,148
Let me go!

788
01:33:09,664 --> 01:33:10,858
Stop this!

789
01:33:23,544 --> 01:33:24,568
Hanna!

790
01:33:24,646 --> 01:33:26,477
Hanna, please!

791
01:33:27,348 --> 01:33:31,011
I tried to prepare you
for what your life would be.

792
01:33:31,085 --> 01:33:33,485
You didn't
prepare me for this.

793
01:33:37,659 --> 01:33:38,990
Run.

794
01:33:40,495 --> 01:33:41,723
Run.

795
01:34:09,924 --> 01:34:12,290
Is that
all you've got?

796
01:34:12,427 --> 01:34:13,553
Huh?

797
01:34:13,628 --> 01:34:15,220
Run, little piggy!

798
01:36:14,916 --> 01:36:16,781
Why now, Erik?

799
01:36:20,321 --> 01:36:22,687
Kids grow up.

800
01:36:57,892 --> 01:36:59,450
Mr. Grimm!

801
01:37:01,863 --> 01:37:04,559
Mr. Grimm! Mr. Grimm?

802
01:38:17,338 --> 01:38:18,930
Hanna!

803
01:38:32,887 --> 01:38:35,048
I’m here now, Hanna.

804
01:40:01,375 --> 01:40:02,364
Ah.

805
01:40:02,943 --> 01:40:04,467
Don't worry, sweetheart.

806
01:40:04,645 --> 01:40:05,634
Don't!

807
01:40:06,380 --> 01:40:08,371
Don't move any closer!

808
01:40:10,518 --> 01:40:13,078
Hanna, I can help you.

809
01:40:13,754 --> 01:40:15,085
Please.

810
01:40:16,424 --> 01:40:19,154
I don't want to
hurt anyone anymore.

811
01:40:20,394 --> 01:40:22,624
I just wanna talk.

812
01:40:23,664 --> 01:40:25,894
It’s over now, Marissa.

813
01:40:29,804 --> 01:40:31,431
Let me go.

814
01:40:32,773 --> 01:40:34,104
Hanna!

815
01:40:35,576 --> 01:40:37,942
Don't walk away
from me, young lady!

816
01:43:11,398 --> 01:43:13,593
I just missed your heart.

817
01:47:45,706 --> 01:47:48,641
<i>Music.
A combination of sounds,</i>

818
01:47:48,842 --> 01:47:53,302
<i>with a view to beauty of form
and expression of emotion.</i>
