1
00:00:18,585 --> 00:00:20,075
Single file.

2
00:00:20,153 --> 00:00:22,348
Stay to the right
of the line.

3
00:00:23,123 --> 00:00:24,522
Take your time.

4
00:00:24,591 --> 00:00:26,616
Take a good look.

5
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:29,985
Hey, um, are you sure
they can't see us?

6
00:00:30,063 --> 00:00:32,031
One-way mirror, ma'am.

7
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:36,462
Picture, in 3... 2... 1.

8
00:01:15,809 --> 00:01:18,676
A heinous crime
has been committed here.

9
00:01:18,945 --> 00:01:20,630
Should you decide
that your testimony

10
00:01:20,665 --> 00:01:22,280
might jeopardize
your personal safety.

11
00:01:22,315 --> 00:01:25,250
Look, Sipowicz
I said I'd tell you everything.

12
00:01:25,552 --> 00:01:26,753
I was just hoping
we could finish this up...

13
00:01:26,788 --> 00:01:28,721
before menopause kicks in.

14
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:33,381
Let's start with the one that
thinks her shit don't stink...

15
00:01:33,693 --> 00:01:35,593
Diane Weston.

16
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:39,330
She's like a goddamn
poster child for high school.

17
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:42,166
Morning, sunshine.

18
00:01:42,235 --> 00:01:45,170
Remember, these are
the best days of your life.

19
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:48,968
So far.

20
00:01:49,242 --> 00:01:50,941
She's the "A" squad captain.

21
00:01:50,976 --> 00:01:52,641
She stole that title from me.

22
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:54,207
You should charge her
with that.

23
00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:56,908
All right, girls
let's take it from the top.

24
00:01:57,917 --> 00:02:00,511
And one, and two,
and one, and two...

25
00:02:00,587 --> 00:02:01,738
Hi, Bruce.

26
00:02:01,773 --> 00:02:02,928
You look cute.

27
00:02:02,963 --> 00:02:04,083
Tommy Hilfiger.

28
00:02:04,324 --> 00:02:06,189
I'm hoping
fourth year's the charm.

29
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:09,385
Outta my way, fag...
I'm up.

30
00:02:11,264 --> 00:02:14,233
Lisa... is that you?

31
00:02:17,203 --> 00:02:19,034
I lost a little weight.

32
00:02:19,372 --> 00:02:20,202
Wow.

33
00:02:20,273 --> 00:02:22,070
This really should've
been my year.

34
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:23,975
I had a lot of work done.

35
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:27,070
I mean, I had done a lot
of work over the summer.

36
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:29,781
You could tell
I made her nervous.

37
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:33,752
But they have to, you know
spread the talent around, so...

38
00:02:34,053 --> 00:02:37,181
I've been on the "B" squad
for 4 years.

39
00:02:37,524 --> 00:02:39,858
Now, the squad as a whole...

40
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:42,259
they're closer
than Carolina cousins.

41
00:02:42,362 --> 00:02:43,495
I mean, some people say...

42
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:45,663
they're, like
lesbos or something...

43
00:02:45,698 --> 00:02:49,532
but that's just mostly
the yag-offs in band.

44
00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:53,638
Truth is, they're so close...

45
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:58,474
they all get their monthly visit
from Aunt Rose at the same time.

46
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:00,145
This one's Hannah Wald.

47
00:03:00,213 --> 00:03:03,910
She's like this uber Christian
doesn't really say much.

48
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,585
In fact,
if she wasn't kind of pretty...

49
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:08,577
you'd go,
"Hey, who's the thrt?"

50
00:03:08,788 --> 00:03:10,915
Then there's Cleo Miller.

51
00:03:11,057 --> 00:03:13,924
Number one: Not a real C-cup.

52
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,527
I've been in the locker room.

53
00:03:15,662 --> 00:03:17,596
And number two...

54
00:03:18,631 --> 00:03:20,565
she has to see
the school shrink.

55
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:25,434
She's completely obsessed
with Conan O'Brien.

56
00:03:26,272 --> 00:03:27,637
Dreams?

57
00:03:28,107 --> 00:03:32,168
You mean like where I'm in
Conan's all-leather apartment?

58
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:35,110
I mean,
I don't know if he has one...

59
00:03:35,181 --> 00:03:37,115
but that's why it's a dream.

60
00:03:37,617 --> 00:03:42,020
And suddenly, we're
buck-naker and all oiled up.

61
00:03:42,655 --> 00:03:44,551
I don't know where
the oil comes from...

62
00:03:44,586 --> 00:03:46,448
but, again,
that's why it's a dream.

63
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:50,257
Then, there's Kansas Hill,
the original bad seed.

64
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:54,025
Son of a blue-balled bitch,
I always get this one.

65
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:56,369
Mouth on her that could stop
a bull in heat.

66
00:03:56,404 --> 00:03:58,105
She gets her nut brain
from her mother.

67
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:59,806
You see, Kansas' mom's
been in prison...

68
00:03:59,841 --> 00:04:02,172
ever since
the day she was born.

69
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:05,558
She was just lying there,
in labor with Kansas...

70
00:04:05,593 --> 00:04:08,741
when she hears something
going on in the next bed.

71
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:13,352
Turns out it's Kansas' dad
taking a nurse's temperature.

72
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:17,317
Stay with me.
I'm trying to be delicate.

73
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:19,874
Anyway,
she whips out a shotgun...

74
00:04:19,909 --> 00:04:22,258
and blows his ass
to kingdom come.

75
00:04:22,328 --> 00:04:24,429
So, she got
life without parole...

76
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:26,694
and now Kansas lives
with her grandparents.

77
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:28,427
And then there's Lucy.

78
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:30,330
Geek extraordinaire.

79
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:32,028
A walking left brain.

80
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:34,407
She's supposed to have
this genius IQ...

81
00:04:34,442 --> 00:04:35,740
but the truth is...

82
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:39,506
she's an obsessive-compulsive
little freak.

83
00:04:40,513 --> 00:04:42,777
OK, hands in, ladies.

84
00:04:46,152 --> 00:04:47,652
Today,
we're gonna cheer loud...

85
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:50,383
jump high,
and look pretty because...

86
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:52,424
Cheerleaders kick...

87
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,294
Now, let's get going,
'cause no one ever got ahead...

88
00:04:54,329 --> 00:04:56,125
by sitting on their behind.

89
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:00,399
The school year
started off like normal.

90
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,049
Principal smith
gave his pep talk.

91
00:05:03,084 --> 00:05:05,599
If you are approached
to buy drugs...

92
00:05:05,738 --> 00:05:09,299
let someone you trust know.

93
00:05:09,842 --> 00:05:14,779
Lf... you are thinking...
of harming yourself...

94
00:05:14,947 --> 00:05:16,710
or others...

95
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:19,213
let someone know.

96
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:22,985
If it burns
when you urinate...

97
00:05:23,222 --> 00:05:24,956
have milky seepage...

98
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:28,256
or are being touched
by uncle...

99
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:31,392
let someone know.

100
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,099
Come on, you guys!

101
00:05:35,134 --> 00:05:38,035
Let's hear it
for the Lincoln "A" squad!

102
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:42,299
"A" squad? Right.

103
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:45,078
I was doing better dance numbers
in grade school.

104
00:05:45,113 --> 00:05:47,376
It really burned my toast.

105
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:27,981
Now, I know it's my duty
to give you all the facts.

106
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:31,322
So, I'm gonna have to say
that their cheer blew...

107
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,916
like a bulimic
after Christmas dinner.

108
00:06:37,764 --> 00:06:39,297
Their blatant disregard...

109
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:41,467
for National High school
Cheerleading Association...

110
00:06:41,502 --> 00:06:43,492
rules made me sick.

111
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:46,932
Basket toss flips
and wool fall pyramids...

112
00:06:47,006 --> 00:06:50,066
over two people high
are strictly prohibited.

113
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,211
Yeah!

114
00:06:55,848 --> 00:06:58,339
I made a complete report
and sent it in.

115
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:20,294
Hey! Go, Lincoln!

116
00:07:20,506 --> 00:07:23,498
Hey! Go, Lincoln!

117
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:27,174
Hey... go... Lincoln!

118
00:07:27,814 --> 00:07:30,874
And, finally, the moment
we'd all been waiting for...

119
00:07:30,983 --> 00:07:33,474
Transferring from Truman High...

120
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:35,611
the new star quarterback...

121
00:07:35,721 --> 00:07:39,122
of our
Mighty Fightin' Lincolns

122
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:41,259
Jack Bartlett!

123
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:42,886
That's when Jack and Diane met.

124
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:45,055
Nobody saw it coming...

125
00:07:45,164 --> 00:07:47,394
especially not Jack.

126
00:08:03,049 --> 00:08:04,949
Jack was fine.

127
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:07,585
Oh, man, was he fine.

128
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,967
It was like
he was a bar of chocolate...

129
00:08:10,002 --> 00:08:12,215
and the whole school
was on the rag.

130
00:08:12,558 --> 00:08:14,651
Everyone wanted a piece of him.

131
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,921
Jack Bartlett.

132
00:08:23,536 --> 00:08:26,699
Is Jack Bartlett
interested in me?

133
00:08:27,373 --> 00:08:30,243
I'm sorry... can someone else
please run the board?

134
00:08:30,278 --> 00:08:31,509
It's creepy, it's wrong...

135
00:08:31,544 --> 00:08:32,958
and it goes against
the teachings

136
00:08:32,993 --> 00:08:34,373
of my Lord and savior,
Jesus Christ.

137
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:37,109
Hannah, in order to get real
answers from the nether world...

138
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:39,413
you've got to have a Christian
virgin run the board.

139
00:08:39,485 --> 00:08:41,885
Your kind is pure of heart
the devil won't dick with you.

140
00:08:41,954 --> 00:08:43,855
Well, uh, technically...

141
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:45,414
I don't think
I'm a virgin anymore.

142
00:08:45,558 --> 00:08:46,290
What!

143
00:08:46,325 --> 00:08:48,259
At church camp this summer

144
00:08:48,327 --> 00:08:49,851
I'm pretty sure I had...

145
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:51,988
you know, my first orgasm.

146
00:08:52,064 --> 00:08:52,797
Hold up.

147
00:08:52,832 --> 00:08:55,067
Any sentence that starts with,
"At Church camp...

148
00:08:55,102 --> 00:08:56,534
ain't leading to the big "O".

149
00:08:56,569 --> 00:08:58,904
That's not true
those pictures of Christ...

150
00:08:58,939 --> 00:09:01,240
all sweaty and bare chested
on the cross...

151
00:09:01,275 --> 00:09:03,606
always kind of made me hot.

152
00:09:05,978 --> 00:09:07,880
Well, I want to know
what happened.

153
00:09:07,915 --> 00:09:09,733
OK, well, one night
around sunset...

154
00:09:09,768 --> 00:09:11,551
I went horseback riding
with the nuns.

155
00:09:11,586 --> 00:09:12,984
They went every night.

156
00:09:13,252 --> 00:09:15,413
And we're trotting
pretty hard, you know?

157
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,750
All of a sudden,
I feel...

158
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:20,288
I feel just super-alive,
you know?

159
00:09:22,161 --> 00:09:24,891
Maybe I'll just ask
the question myself.

160
00:09:26,465 --> 00:09:29,195
Is Jack Bartlett
interested in me?

161
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:33,033
He is.

162
00:09:37,343 --> 00:09:39,573
Hey, man,
is this thing, like on?

163
00:09:40,212 --> 00:09:42,949
OK, I'm just here
to announce my candidacy...

164
00:09:42,984 --> 00:09:44,917
for the homecoming queen.

165
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:48,176
Uh, I plan
to spread the world on 4-H.

166
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:50,113
It's all about
the cows, man...

167
00:09:50,289 --> 00:09:51,722
Look, I'll be honest with you

168
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:54,209
most of us realized we didn't
have a whore's chance...

169
00:09:54,244 --> 00:09:56,662
in heaven with Jack, the day
of the candidate speechers.

170
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:57,990
Youth...

171
00:09:58,898 --> 00:10:00,388
and agriculture.

172
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:03,124
4- H, 4-H rules!

173
00:10:08,841 --> 00:10:10,604
Thank you, sir.

174
00:10:10,876 --> 00:10:12,503
Good job.

175
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:15,804
Um, as... as the A-V Club
candidate...

176
00:10:15,881 --> 00:10:19,681
I think, for the...
for the first time in 50 years...

177
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:21,886
uh, we should...
we should say no.

178
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:24,851
We should... we should say no
to a football player as king.

179
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:28,657
Vote brains over brawn...

180
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:55,154
It was the first time
most of us...

181
00:10:55,189 --> 00:10:56,849
even heard Jack speak.

182
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:58,547
Thanks, wow.

183
00:10:59,725 --> 00:11:01,283
We weren't disappointed.

184
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,351
OK, guys...
hey, guys...

185
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:05,221
All right,
would you shut up a minute?

186
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:07,632
I was just joking.

187
00:11:10,803 --> 00:11:13,904
Well, uh, I just think
it really rocks...

188
00:11:13,939 --> 00:11:17,238
that the football team picked me
as their, you know, candidate.

189
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:20,811
Yeah!

190
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:22,647
We love you, Jack!

191
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,650
Well, I love you, too,
lunch ladies.

192
00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:29,549
I just want to say that there's
only 3 things I want in life:

193
00:11:29,822 --> 00:11:32,222
To someday become a senator
of this great state...

194
00:11:35,227 --> 00:11:36,751
I want to lead
the Mighty Fightin' Lincolns

195
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:38,797
to victory
at the homecoming game.

196
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:41,660
All right!

197
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:45,069
And, uh...

198
00:11:45,104 --> 00:11:46,405
I want to go
to the homecoming dance...

199
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,134
with Diane Weston.

200
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:16,881
Ugh, they were like
friggin' Barbie and Ken...

201
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:19,296
but without the pink
remote-control Corvette.

202
00:12:19,438 --> 00:12:21,140
Overnight, people were going, like...

203
00:12:21,175 --> 00:12:23,700
Oh, they're
the perfect couple.

204
00:12:23,976 --> 00:12:26,035
They're so cute.

205
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:28,446
I'm sure it gave
the Internet whacks...

206
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:30,816
something to talk about
besides Agent Scully...

207
00:12:30,851 --> 00:12:32,784
and their most recent
wet dream.

208
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:37,282
Now, I'm not one to gossip...

209
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:45,058
but I think Jack and Diane
got so close, so fast...

210
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:47,759
because they discovered
how much they both loved...

211
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,767
football.

212
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:52,196
Man, did they love
their football.

213
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:55,729
Hey, ho, let's go!

214
00:12:55,808 --> 00:12:57,875
Hey, ho...

215
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:59,639
I don't know about the "hey"...

216
00:12:59,712 --> 00:13:02,044
but "ho" is right on the money.

217
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:03,314
If they'd asked...

218
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:05,317
I so easily could have
helped them out...

219
00:13:05,352 --> 00:13:07,068
with some new material.

220
00:13:07,103 --> 00:13:08,785
Green 88! Green 88!

221
00:13:09,922 --> 00:13:11,549
Set, hut.

222
00:13:42,354 --> 00:13:47,883
I... love... you.

223
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:53,129
I... love... you.

224
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:06,176
Woo!
Woo, yeah!

225
00:14:09,648 --> 00:14:11,445
Yeah, baby.

226
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:18,789
Now, right about here...

227
00:14:18,824 --> 00:14:21,088
is where the real shit
stated to hit the fan.

228
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:23,162
Don't worry,
I'll clean this up a bit...

229
00:14:23,197 --> 00:14:25,153
if I have to appear
in court.

230
00:14:26,232 --> 00:14:28,393
Especially
if we're on Court TV.

231
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:35,832
Ha, well, there's
a Christmas card!

232
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,071
Oh!
Oh, hey, Jack...

233
00:14:39,144 --> 00:14:41,747
why don't you go light
a fire under Diane, huh?

234
00:14:41,782 --> 00:14:43,271
Heh heh, I'm on it,
Mr. Weston.

235
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:44,816
All right!

236
00:14:45,117 --> 00:14:46,652
Say,
where are my manners?

237
00:14:46,687 --> 00:14:47,484
I'm Dee Dee.

238
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,817
You can remember me
because of my double Ds!

239
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,857
Oh, don't you
show them!

240
00:14:52,591 --> 00:14:54,718
And I'm Diane's dad,
Dennis.

241
00:14:54,793 --> 00:14:58,194
Now, don't try that after
one of my screwdrivers, OK?

242
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,390
So, who wants
pigs in a blanket?

243
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:11,710
Excuse me, Vendela,
have you seen Diane?

244
00:15:11,745 --> 00:15:13,209
Because we were
supposed to go...

245
00:15:13,244 --> 00:15:14,673
to the homecoming dance
tonight.

246
00:15:20,619 --> 00:15:22,211
Oh, baby.

247
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:28,391
Now, I obviously wasn't there
the night they all met.

248
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:31,987
But I'm sure it was
a super goober fest.

249
00:15:32,164 --> 00:15:35,327
Your Jack is one heck of
a good football player.

250
00:15:35,401 --> 00:15:37,130
I don't know how
he can concentrate...

251
00:15:37,202 --> 00:15:41,104
with your lovely Diane
cheering on the side line.

252
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:47,302
Aw, look at this.

253
00:15:48,047 --> 00:15:49,412
Oh, my,
look at that.

254
00:15:49,481 --> 00:15:51,972
Look at those two.

255
00:15:52,051 --> 00:15:52,850
All right. Hold up.

256
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:54,250
I have
an announcement to make.

257
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:57,545
Me and Diane, uh...

258
00:15:58,657 --> 00:16:01,057
Oh, what the hey?
We're getting married.

259
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,787
No! Yes!

260
00:16:09,702 --> 00:16:11,602
Oh, what a surprise!

261
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:12,870
But, well...

262
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:14,896
Not before
I have our baby.

263
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,612
So, when your dad said...

264
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:24,377
I never want to see
your fing faces again...

265
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:27,512
do you think he meant
"Forever" forever...

266
00:16:27,686 --> 00:16:30,018
or just until
your mom wakes up?

267
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:31,681
I don't know.

268
00:16:32,257 --> 00:16:33,588
And what the hell was
that sound she made...

269
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:35,718
right before
she hit the ground?

270
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:41,756
Well, if I had to guess...

271
00:16:42,401 --> 00:16:45,199
I'd say that, that was
the sound of a mother...

272
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:47,761
saying good-bye to her little boy...

273
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,873
and hello to the young man...

274
00:16:49,908 --> 00:16:52,570
who's going to be
a daddy of his own.

275
00:16:54,046 --> 00:16:57,846
Jack, do you know
what I see here?

276
00:16:58,050 --> 00:16:59,881
Spit from your dad?

277
00:17:01,053 --> 00:17:02,816
I see a flower.

278
00:17:03,088 --> 00:17:05,824
And you know, even
the most beautiful flowers...

279
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:08,054
still grow from dirt.

280
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:09,684
Yeah.

281
00:17:09,795 --> 00:17:11,763
And while we're knee-deep
in it right now...

282
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:14,631
and things may seem
pretty stinky...

283
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:15,997
in the long run...

284
00:17:16,068 --> 00:17:18,366
we're going to
grow strong from this.

285
00:17:19,138 --> 00:17:20,205
You think?

286
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,272
I sure do.

287
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,307
Diane...

288
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:28,377
I've loved you
since I first saw you.

289
00:17:29,681 --> 00:17:32,047
Right before you
kicked me in the head.

290
00:17:32,851 --> 00:17:34,580
Oh, Jack.

291
00:17:58,343 --> 00:17:59,877
Now... I don't think...

292
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:02,608
Diane just up and told the squad
about the baby that night...

293
00:18:02,681 --> 00:18:06,640
but somehow they managed
to figure it out.

294
00:18:06,718 --> 00:18:08,709
No, thanks.
Don't need one.

295
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:16,724
So?

296
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:20,364
Holy shit.

297
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:22,594
You just became
a statistic.

298
00:18:22,968 --> 00:18:25,095
Oh, my God.
I'm not the first.

299
00:18:25,204 --> 00:18:26,694
But you're not married.

300
00:18:26,805 --> 00:18:29,241
Wait, did you
say you are pregnant...

301
00:18:29,276 --> 00:18:30,674
or you were pregnant?

302
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:31,975
You had it,
threw it out...

303
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:33,671
and now you're going to
go back and dance all night?

304
00:18:33,745 --> 00:18:34,973
Shut up, Cleo.

305
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,816
Di, how much do you need
for an abortion?

306
00:18:37,851 --> 00:18:38,805
What?

307
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:40,748
No.
Not an abortion.

308
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:42,582
My church can arrange for you
to go to Oregon...

309
00:18:42,654 --> 00:18:43,882
and take care of
a sick aunt...

310
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:45,082
for 9 months.

311
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:46,590
Then they find
your baby a good home...

312
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,727
and you come back
a little dazed and puffy...

313
00:18:48,762 --> 00:18:50,490
but everything's fine.

314
00:18:50,596 --> 00:18:51,730
Oh, please, Di,
don't be a whore...

315
00:18:51,765 --> 00:18:53,197
and a murderer.

316
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,961
Jack told the team
that night, too.

317
00:18:57,035 --> 00:18:58,900
Hey, guys, I, uh...

318
00:18:59,204 --> 00:19:00,967
I got Diane pregnant.

319
00:19:01,707 --> 00:19:02,799
What?

320
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:04,365
Well, all right!

321
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:06,671
You nailed Diane Weston?

322
00:19:06,745 --> 00:19:09,407
Ha! I'd never wash
my Johnson again.

323
00:19:10,716 --> 00:19:11,512
Hey.

324
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:12,808
Yeah.

325
00:19:13,385 --> 00:19:14,613
Ha-hoo!

326
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:25,061
I didn't mean to
say whore, Diane.

327
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,392
It's just that
I hear it...

328
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:28,329
so much at church...
it kind of came...

329
00:19:28,433 --> 00:19:29,593
flying out of my head.

330
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:31,259
I know, Hannah.

331
00:19:32,037 --> 00:19:34,972
Look... I'm not going
to get an abortion.

332
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:38,036
I've always planned on
getting married and having kids.

333
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:40,174
I'm just going
a little out of order.

334
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:44,982
Kind of reminds me
of another young lady...

335
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,810
who found herself with child...

336
00:19:48,587 --> 00:19:50,111
unmarried...

337
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:52,314
on a long, long road...

338
00:19:52,491 --> 00:19:54,186
with no place to sleep.

339
00:19:54,726 --> 00:19:57,820
Of course, that was
a long, long time ago.

340
00:19:58,564 --> 00:20:00,191
But no matter what...

341
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,664
she held her head high...

342
00:20:02,834 --> 00:20:06,497
and said, "Papa, don't preach.

343
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:08,970
I'm in trouble deep.

344
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:12,243
Papa, don't preach...

345
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:14,603
'cause I made up my mind...

346
00:20:14,746 --> 00:20:16,338
I'm keepin' my baby.

347
00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:19,583
Yeah, I'm gonna keep my baby. "

348
00:20:22,654 --> 00:20:24,019
The great one.

349
00:20:24,289 --> 00:20:25,483
Madonna.

350
00:20:25,657 --> 00:20:27,989
We're here for you, Diane.

351
00:20:29,928 --> 00:20:31,479
You guys...

352
00:20:31,514 --> 00:20:33,030
Thanks. Oh...

353
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:37,158
I'll pray for you
every night.

354
00:20:38,003 --> 00:20:39,061
We love you.

355
00:20:39,137 --> 00:20:41,002
I love you guys.
You're the best.

356
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:42,233
Oh, Diane!

357
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:44,569
I guess their little fairy tale
could have ended there.

358
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:47,374
The only problem was they didn't
have a place to live.

359
00:20:47,446 --> 00:20:48,538
What?

360
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,748
But all of
our paper work's here.

361
00:20:50,816 --> 00:20:51,782
My school records...

362
00:20:51,817 --> 00:20:54,081
and Jack's football records.

363
00:20:54,152 --> 00:20:55,949
Let me explain something...

364
00:20:56,054 --> 00:20:57,521
No, wait... did I say...

365
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:59,250
Cross my heart, hope to die,
stick a needle in my eye...

366
00:20:59,324 --> 00:21:01,193
that we will never,
ever miss a payment?

367
00:21:01,228 --> 00:21:03,821
Uh, yes.
Yes, you did.

368
00:21:04,329 --> 00:21:06,456
I think I know where
this one's going.

369
00:21:06,698 --> 00:21:08,359
Um, listen...

370
00:21:09,001 --> 00:21:11,231
I'm willing to put up my papers
on my GTO.

371
00:21:11,336 --> 00:21:13,395
Now, she's got
a few miles on her...

372
00:21:13,505 --> 00:21:15,268
but she looks great.

373
00:21:15,407 --> 00:21:17,534
I'm sure, son, but, um...

374
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:20,644
She's twisting my arm.

375
00:21:20,746 --> 00:21:22,543
I'm going to throw in
the speakers, too.

376
00:21:22,648 --> 00:21:25,014
Why don't you just have
your parents come in...

377
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:25,882
and get the loan,

378
00:21:25,917 --> 00:21:27,908
and then they can
give you the money?

379
00:21:27,986 --> 00:21:29,783
With all
due respect, ma'am...

380
00:21:29,921 --> 00:21:31,650
Jack and Diane Bartlett...

381
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,717
do not accept charity.

382
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:37,522
We are two young,
able-bodied Americans.

383
00:21:37,896 --> 00:21:39,557
We're not looking for
a hand out...

384
00:21:39,665 --> 00:21:41,098
we're looking for a hand up.

385
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,534
Give us food, and we'll
be hungry tomorrow...

386
00:21:44,002 --> 00:21:45,235
but give us corn...

387
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:47,704
the kind
you plant, not eat...

388
00:21:47,873 --> 00:21:49,898
and we'll grow it...

389
00:21:50,042 --> 00:21:53,136
and uh, um... cut it...

390
00:21:53,378 --> 00:21:54,709
and, uh...

391
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:57,008
you know, eat it.

392
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:01,051
Now, if you're interested
in giving us a home loan...

393
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:02,586
I will sit back down.

394
00:22:02,688 --> 00:22:05,020
If not,
have a nice day, ma'am.

395
00:22:05,457 --> 00:22:07,550
Sorry.
My hands are tied.

396
00:22:15,967 --> 00:22:18,060
She's on the honor roll.

397
00:22:18,403 --> 00:22:21,270
Somehow, they managed to find
their dream house anyway.

398
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,171
More of a dump,
if you ask me.

399
00:22:23,241 --> 00:22:24,538
We'll take it.

400
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:28,378
Oh, fine. Fine.
Jesus, settle down, OK?

401
00:22:28,413 --> 00:22:31,678
Let's just keep in mind here
I manage the building, OK?

402
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,741
I don't, like, own it,
and I don't fix shit.

403
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:35,911
And I also don't care
if shit breaks, OK?

404
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:38,114
All I care is
you little bastards...

405
00:22:38,223 --> 00:22:41,021
shove the rent under my door
on the 1st, you got that?

406
00:22:41,126 --> 00:22:42,150
You understand that?

407
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:45,627
OK. Oh, yeah,
and one more thing.

408
00:22:45,797 --> 00:22:47,265
You see any packages
outside my door...

409
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,425
you leave them
the hell alone.

410
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,899
Capisce?

411
00:22:55,774 --> 00:22:58,709
Two taco grandes!

412
00:22:58,844 --> 00:23:02,075
One bean burrito.

413
00:23:02,814 --> 00:23:05,908
A large taco chip.

414
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:09,312
And guacamole.

415
00:23:11,857 --> 00:23:13,916
And that'll be...

416
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:15,856
35 cents.

417
00:23:20,098 --> 00:23:22,965
We don't really have
fried rats in the buckets.

418
00:23:24,202 --> 00:23:26,636
I know. I checked.

419
00:23:29,174 --> 00:23:30,971
You know what? I'm going
to save you the time.

420
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:33,192
I'm not going to lie.
I don't believe in it.

421
00:23:33,227 --> 00:23:35,308
If you pick your ass,
I'm going to tell people.

422
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:36,972
I have no idea
how to run your register.

423
00:23:37,048 --> 00:23:38,811
You're Jack Bartlett, right?

424
00:23:39,618 --> 00:23:40,585
Yeah.

425
00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:42,120
So, you'd be, like...

426
00:23:42,155 --> 00:23:43,186
hanging out with us...

427
00:23:43,221 --> 00:23:45,086
every night after school,
then, right?

428
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:45,949
Yeah.

429
00:23:45,957 --> 00:23:47,925
Well, I mean, after
football practice, yeah.

430
00:23:48,393 --> 00:23:50,020
Football practice?

431
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:54,899
Fantastic.

432
00:23:54,966 --> 00:23:56,900
You're so hired.

433
00:24:04,709 --> 00:24:06,734
I'm on top of the world!

434
00:24:14,219 --> 00:24:15,919
Hey, Di,
if we have a girl...

435
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:17,444
we should dress her
like Little Debbie.

436
00:24:17,522 --> 00:24:19,114
Jack, honey, I'm only
eating for two.

437
00:24:19,191 --> 00:24:19,990
No, I know

438
00:24:20,025 --> 00:24:21,943
but all this food
reminds me of how much...

439
00:24:21,978 --> 00:24:23,862
I want to teach our baby...
Cocoa Puffs: Good

440
00:24:23,897 --> 00:24:25,056
Captain Crunch is bad.

441
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,663
It shreds the roof
of your mouth.

442
00:24:26,698 --> 00:24:28,393
Now, you're not born
with that knowledge.

443
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:29,751
You hear "Trix are for kids".

444
00:24:29,786 --> 00:24:31,111
And you think,
"OK, I'm a kid.

445
00:24:31,146 --> 00:24:32,402
So I guess
they're for me. "

446
00:24:32,437 --> 00:24:34,837
But your little baby brain's got
no idea...

447
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,354
that Lucky Charms are, like...

448
00:24:36,389 --> 00:24:37,769
a million times better for you.

449
00:24:37,843 --> 00:24:38,775
Jack.

450
00:24:38,877 --> 00:24:40,606
Hey. Pop quiz.

451
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:43,873
If you could be Count Chocula
or Trix the rabbit, who would you be?

452
00:24:44,015 --> 00:24:46,279
Uh... Trix.

453
00:24:47,185 --> 00:24:49,551
Me, too. God!
Will it never end?

454
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:51,383
I love this lady!

455
00:24:54,226 --> 00:24:56,558
Jack, I think I should
get a job.

456
00:24:57,195 --> 00:24:59,595
No, but we agreed your job’s
running the baby machine.

457
00:24:59,698 --> 00:25:01,598
I know, but that
was before I realized...

458
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:04,533
Oh... I almost forgot gas
for the baby machine.

459
00:25:04,603 --> 00:25:06,104
I'm going to get
your snickers...

460
00:25:06,139 --> 00:25:07,605
I'm going to meet you
in line, OK?

461
00:25:07,706 --> 00:25:10,106
- Mm... love you.
- I love you.

462
00:25:28,059 --> 00:25:29,185
Hey, Di!

463
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:31,223
Hi, I'm a little professor!

464
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:33,097
Wouldn't it be cute
if ours looked like this?

465
00:25:33,164 --> 00:25:34,799
Yeah, you little marsh...

466
00:25:34,834 --> 00:25:35,925
Honey?!

467
00:25:36,134 --> 00:25:38,398
Oh, I am really sorry.

468
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:40,030
Jack...

469
00:25:45,911 --> 00:25:47,546
I never knew you
dreamed of working...

470
00:25:47,581 --> 00:25:49,411
in a grocery store bank branch.

471
00:25:49,581 --> 00:25:52,243
Baby, we are living
the great American dream.

472
00:25:53,785 --> 00:25:55,086
If you reach
for the stars...

473
00:25:55,121 --> 00:25:57,418
you're bound to step...

474
00:25:58,356 --> 00:25:59,323
Jack, pull over.

475
00:26:00,091 --> 00:26:01,488
Pull over.

476
00:26:01,523 --> 00:26:02,886
Oh, Jesus, ew!

477
00:26:07,866 --> 00:26:09,857
Why do they call it
morning sickness?

478
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:12,029
It's OK.
Get it all out.

479
00:26:12,203 --> 00:26:13,932
Do you have
any breath mints?

480
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:18,232
So, she's in my hands, right?

481
00:26:18,476 --> 00:26:20,376
Moist to the touch.

482
00:26:20,545 --> 00:26:23,248
Now, it's at that second
that I think I control her...

483
00:26:23,283 --> 00:26:24,715
you know, she's mine.

484
00:26:24,849 --> 00:26:26,749
But it's a false illusion.

485
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:29,110
You know, it's like
in that movie "Backdraft".

486
00:26:29,287 --> 00:26:31,721
No man controls fire.

487
00:26:33,725 --> 00:26:35,317
So, she's ready.

488
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:36,856
I'm ready.

489
00:26:37,062 --> 00:26:38,290
She's ready.

490
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:40,657
I yell...

491
00:26:41,032 --> 00:26:43,262
42-58. Hike!

492
00:26:45,136 --> 00:26:46,364
Touch down.

493
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:57,343
Where were we?

494
00:27:23,708 --> 00:27:25,539
I need a place
to keep this.

495
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:27,373
So if anyone asks,
what do you know?

496
00:27:27,612 --> 00:27:29,170
That's right.
You don't know shit.

497
00:28:07,452 --> 00:28:11,582
Diane, it says here you're going
to have mood swings...

498
00:28:11,723 --> 00:28:13,623
uncontrollable gas...

499
00:28:13,725 --> 00:28:15,659
It's more proof God's a guy.

500
00:28:16,661 --> 00:28:20,495
And sex dreams where you
actually have an orgasm.

501
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:23,065
Well, the Virgin Mary
must have snuck that one in.

502
00:28:33,511 --> 00:28:35,911
Come on, Jack, you promised.

503
00:28:37,682 --> 00:28:38,982
OK. One question.

504
00:28:39,017 --> 00:28:40,282
Oh, me, me, me!

505
00:28:40,452 --> 00:28:41,510
Mine's great.

506
00:28:41,586 --> 00:28:43,383
Proceed, Dungeon Master Quon.

507
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:46,717
OK, Jack.

508
00:28:46,925 --> 00:28:50,383
You know how you
and Diane slept together?

509
00:28:50,795 --> 00:28:51,955
Yeah.

510
00:28:53,364 --> 00:28:55,389
Well, now that you can't
sleep together...

511
00:28:55,533 --> 00:28:56,932
but you still sleep together...

512
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:58,660
don't you ever get just, like...

513
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,162
super horny?

514
00:29:00,305 --> 00:29:02,739
And if so, how horny?

515
00:29:04,142 --> 00:29:06,133
I'll be quiet now
so I can listen to your answer.

516
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:07,472
Yeah, Jack.

517
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,477
I'd love to hear your answer.

518
00:29:11,716 --> 00:29:13,047
The answer's easy.

519
00:29:13,718 --> 00:29:17,176
Oh, uh... "Lolita"
is due back tomorrow.

520
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:21,256
Same for "91/2 Weeks"
and ditto on "Wild Things".

521
00:29:23,995 --> 00:29:27,396
Guys... I'm going to be a dad.

522
00:29:28,032 --> 00:29:29,761
Dads don't get horny.

523
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:34,695
To the kids at school,
Jack and Diane had it all.

524
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:37,571
I mean, come on, their own
apartment, staying up late...

525
00:29:37,675 --> 00:29:39,006
eating whatever they wanted...

526
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:41,441
plus Jack was getting
a discount...

527
00:29:41,476 --> 00:29:43,605
on R-rated movies
at the video store.

528
00:29:43,915 --> 00:29:45,849
Hello! Reality check.

529
00:29:46,017 --> 00:29:49,248
School, practice, work,
and Lamaze class?

530
00:29:49,721 --> 00:29:52,349
It was really starting
to take its toll.

531
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:55,716
2, 4, 6, 8...

532
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:58,886
Fighting Lincolns on to state!

533
00:30:02,167 --> 00:30:02,899
Fight!

534
00:30:02,934 --> 00:30:04,868
Lincoln! Fight!

535
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:11,836
Blue 42! Blue 42!

536
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:13,599
Set...

537
00:30:32,931 --> 00:30:34,796
Hut!

538
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:38,125
OK, so they won state.

539
00:30:38,303 --> 00:30:39,895
B. F. D.

540
00:30:40,772 --> 00:30:42,069
The best part was...

541
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:44,266
Diane was really starting
to look like shit.

542
00:30:44,776 --> 00:30:45,902
Diane?

543
00:30:46,611 --> 00:30:47,378
Diane!

544
00:30:47,413 --> 00:30:48,177
Huh?

545
00:30:48,212 --> 00:30:49,442
What?
Oh!

546
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,948
I'm under the ice!
I'm under the ice!

547
00:31:00,725 --> 00:31:02,818
Oh, man, that was a weird one.

548
00:31:02,961 --> 00:31:04,588
Another sex dream?

549
00:31:05,263 --> 00:31:07,356
- Wayne Gretzky.
- Hat trick?

550
00:31:07,432 --> 00:31:09,059
He is the great one.

551
00:31:10,802 --> 00:31:12,167
Oh, my God.

552
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:13,828
You've been robbed.

553
00:31:14,305 --> 00:31:16,136
No, I've been pregnant.

554
00:31:16,441 --> 00:31:18,204
Di, are you OK?

555
00:31:18,309 --> 00:31:21,301
We can skip the girl party
this week.

556
00:31:21,579 --> 00:31:23,446
Everything's fine.

557
00:31:23,481 --> 00:31:24,816
I'm just having
a little trouble...

558
00:31:24,851 --> 00:31:27,046
turning my frown upside down.

559
00:31:27,785 --> 00:31:29,514
Want us to help you pick up?

560
00:31:31,322 --> 00:31:33,756
Don't
Martha freaking Stewart me.

561
00:31:34,792 --> 00:31:37,420
You don't like it, you try being
a pregnant teen.

562
00:31:42,367 --> 00:31:43,595
Jack.

563
00:31:45,436 --> 00:31:46,960
Oh, Jack.

564
00:31:48,806 --> 00:31:50,273
Can I help you?

565
00:31:50,341 --> 00:31:52,400
Get your loser ass
away from me.

566
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:03,747
Oh, my gosh, Jack.

567
00:32:03,955 --> 00:32:05,547
Are you OK?

568
00:32:08,126 --> 00:32:09,388
Diane.

569
00:32:20,071 --> 00:32:21,237
Brendon!
Go with them.

570
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:23,536
They're in the vault,
man. Go! Go!

571
00:32:23,975 --> 00:32:25,670
Who's Mr. Duggan?

572
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:26,937
Mr. Duggan.

573
00:32:27,045 --> 00:32:28,512
You want to open the vault?

574
00:32:28,813 --> 00:32:30,303
Or do you want me to?

575
00:32:30,581 --> 00:32:32,606
Do whatever they want, Terry.

576
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:34,448
Take the keys.
Take them!

577
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:35,952
I'm confused.

578
00:32:36,054 --> 00:32:37,922
Pappas knew the bank robbers
were surfers...

579
00:32:37,957 --> 00:32:40,220
because he saw a tan line?

580
00:32:41,693 --> 00:32:43,259
Luce, it's "Point Break".

581
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:45,091
Just shut up
and look at Keanu.

582
00:32:45,263 --> 00:32:48,232
Di, what would you do
if you were in a holdup?

583
00:32:48,433 --> 00:32:49,525
Well...

584
00:32:50,068 --> 00:32:51,592
I guess I...

585
00:32:52,937 --> 00:32:54,472
I'd give them all the money
they could hold...

586
00:32:54,507 --> 00:32:56,133
and wish them a good life.

587
00:32:56,574 --> 00:32:58,371
Because the Beatles were wrong.

588
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:00,939
Love isn't all you need.

589
00:33:01,179 --> 00:33:02,737
Love won't pay the rent...

590
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,745
Iove won't buy my baby
diapers...

591
00:33:04,882 --> 00:33:06,349
and love sure as
hell won't buy me...

592
00:33:06,417 --> 00:33:09,477
my new Dolce & Gabbana jeans
when I lose my baby weight.

593
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:14,390
Pretty soon we'll be broke...

594
00:33:14,425 --> 00:33:18,122
and I'll just be another fat-ass
wearing Chic jeans.

595
00:33:19,197 --> 00:33:21,529
OK, put the snickers down.

596
00:33:21,632 --> 00:33:22,826
Come kick it over here.

597
00:33:22,934 --> 00:33:23,798
Wait a minute!

598
00:33:23,901 --> 00:33:25,061
Freeze that!
Freeze that!

599
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:26,735
Too much time.

600
00:33:26,804 --> 00:33:27,600
Yeah.

601
00:33:27,739 --> 00:33:29,036
Can you imagine?

602
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:31,665
Conan's head on Keanu's body?

603
00:33:32,243 --> 00:33:33,301
Unstoppable.

604
00:33:33,311 --> 00:33:34,070
No!

605
00:33:34,145 --> 00:33:36,511
That's it!
A bank robbery.

606
00:33:36,614 --> 00:33:38,343
A big pile of money
and my little family-to-be...

607
00:33:38,416 --> 00:33:39,747
could get our heads above water.

608
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:41,417
My God, I read about this.

609
00:33:41,452 --> 00:33:43,317
It's called pregnancy insanity.

610
00:33:43,421 --> 00:33:44,251
Look...

611
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:45,913
I might be moody...

612
00:33:46,157 --> 00:33:47,647
I might be gassy...

613
00:33:47,792 --> 00:33:49,384
but I am perfectly sane.

614
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:50,592
Think about it.

615
00:33:50,661 --> 00:33:53,596
In school they tell us
dreams can come true.

616
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:54,577
Right?

617
00:33:54,612 --> 00:33:55,457
Right.

618
00:33:55,767 --> 00:33:57,530
But they don't tell us how.

619
00:33:58,336 --> 00:33:59,564
Thanks to Keanu...

620
00:33:59,637 --> 00:34:01,229
I've figured it out.

621
00:34:01,639 --> 00:34:04,107
Money makes
your dreams come true.

622
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:07,945
Listen, Kansas,
I know you dream...

623
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:09,344
of springing
your mom someday.

624
00:34:09,614 --> 00:34:11,047
Stop, you're gonna
make me cry.

625
00:34:11,149 --> 00:34:12,810
If the O.J. Trial
taught us anything...

626
00:34:12,917 --> 00:34:14,441
it taught us that in America...

627
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:17,215
you can cut somebody's head off
and still be found innocent...

628
00:34:17,522 --> 00:34:19,513
as long as you have
enough money.

629
00:34:19,957 --> 00:34:21,822
Your mom only shot a guy.

630
00:34:22,493 --> 00:34:23,359
And Cleo?

631
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:26,597
I know you dream of
an all-leather apartment...

632
00:34:26,632 --> 00:34:27,495
with Conan.

633
00:34:28,533 --> 00:34:30,797
I overheard the school shrink
telling the lunch lady.

634
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:34,631
Hannah, you could give
your share to the church...

635
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:36,774
or maybe buy one of
those starving kids...

636
00:34:36,809 --> 00:34:38,605
that Sally Struthers advertises.

637
00:34:38,709 --> 00:34:40,438
Or I could buy my own horse.

638
00:34:40,778 --> 00:34:42,177
Or that.

639
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:43,576
Look, you guys...

640
00:34:43,648 --> 00:34:46,173
I just want to provide
a future for my baby.

641
00:34:47,351 --> 00:34:48,818
I know my bank branch...

642
00:34:48,853 --> 00:34:51,720
like the back of
my puffy little hand.

643
00:34:52,223 --> 00:34:54,748
I could open that safe
in my sleep.

644
00:34:57,595 --> 00:34:58,389
I'm in.

645
00:34:58,463 --> 00:34:59,395
- Yes!
- What?

646
00:34:59,497 --> 00:35:00,797
I mean it.
I'm in.

647
00:35:00,832 --> 00:35:03,630
This is the closest thing to
a goddamn family I've ever had.

648
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:05,531
If one of us needs something,
then we all do.

649
00:35:05,636 --> 00:35:08,264
Stop it!
This is crazy.

650
00:35:08,406 --> 00:35:09,107
I'm in, too.

651
00:35:09,142 --> 00:35:10,506
Cleo!

652
00:35:10,908 --> 00:35:12,205
Kansas is right.

653
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:13,509
We're like sisters.

654
00:35:13,544 --> 00:35:14,744
We're closer than sisters...

655
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:16,974
and you don't turn
your back on family.

656
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:18,582
Come on, Luce.

657
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:20,943
People do it in
the movies all the time.

658
00:35:21,085 --> 00:35:22,848
And they get caught.

659
00:35:22,987 --> 00:35:23,976
That's right.

660
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:26,818
So all we have to do
is watch a bunch of movies...

661
00:35:26,991 --> 00:35:27,958
and learn from
their mistakes.

662
00:35:28,059 --> 00:35:31,153
You know, real cops aren't
half as smart as Keanu.

663
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:32,353
Forget it.

664
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:34,599
I've got a scholarship to
Harvard hanging over my head.

665
00:35:34,634 --> 00:35:35,465
I won't risk it.

666
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:36,933
Conan went to Harvard.

667
00:35:37,435 --> 00:35:40,427
Lucy, are you sure you
have that scholarship?

668
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:43,306
- No.
- And if you don't?

669
00:35:43,374 --> 00:35:45,001
Can you still afford
to go to Harvard?

670
00:35:45,076 --> 00:35:46,407
I don't know, probably not.

671
00:35:46,511 --> 00:35:48,604
So then this isn't crazy, is it?

672
00:35:49,213 --> 00:35:52,738
- It's a sure bet.
- Well...

673
00:35:52,917 --> 00:35:53,849
Come on!

674
00:35:53,951 --> 00:35:55,350
- Come on!
- Please?

675
00:35:55,419 --> 00:35:57,546
I guess we're all
in this together.

676
00:35:57,755 --> 00:35:58,983
But... but!

677
00:35:59,123 --> 00:36:01,489
We have to make a smart plan.

678
00:36:01,592 --> 00:36:02,426
Of course.
Of course.

679
00:36:02,461 --> 00:36:03,916
OK, hands in.

680
00:36:05,963 --> 00:36:07,055
All right.

681
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:08,393
We have to
cross our hearts...

682
00:36:08,466 --> 00:36:09,232
hope to die...

683
00:36:09,267 --> 00:36:11,326
stick a dirty needle
in our eye...

684
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:15,336
that we will never, ever
tell Jack.

685
00:36:15,439 --> 00:36:17,339
We all know
he can't tell a lie.

686
00:36:17,608 --> 00:36:20,133
That's why he's going to make
such a great senator.

687
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:23,506
Cheerleaders kick...

688
00:36:31,756 --> 00:36:33,280
We have two very cool guests...

689
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:34,490
and I'm gonna start with...

690
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:35,793
something I read
in the paper today.

691
00:36:35,828 --> 00:36:38,091
It involves sex.
You hear me?

692
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:41,729
Yeah.

693
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,427
Yeah, don't worry.
Not with me.

694
00:37:08,326 --> 00:37:10,794
I feel totally abandoned
in a place that values...

695
00:37:10,861 --> 00:37:12,920
physical prowess
over mental acuity.

696
00:37:13,297 --> 00:37:14,423
I can't wait until
all that changes...

697
00:37:14,498 --> 00:37:16,159
once we're out
in the real world.

698
00:37:16,968 --> 00:37:17,762
I would.

699
00:37:17,835 --> 00:37:20,633
I'd totally marry Prince William
even if he was gay.

700
00:37:20,805 --> 00:37:24,070
I mean, in England, all guys are
kind of gay anyway, right?

701
00:37:24,475 --> 00:37:26,966
Even cigarettes are fags.

702
00:37:27,111 --> 00:37:29,602
The movie was so amazing.

703
00:37:29,714 --> 00:37:32,512
He slices off the guy's ear,
and I mean you see everything.

704
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:33,515
The bloody pink hole...

705
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:34,850
Cleo, I already
threw up twice today.

706
00:37:34,885 --> 00:37:36,580
Can you please get to any
relevant part of the movie?

707
00:37:36,654 --> 00:37:40,725
Well, you know, they had
nick names, like Mr. Pink...

708
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,793
and I was thinking,
Di, you could be Mrs. Pink.

709
00:37:42,828 --> 00:37:44,283
Could I be Mrs. Purple?

710
00:37:44,362 --> 00:37:46,091
And I could be Mrs. Red
because I love red.

711
00:37:46,397 --> 00:37:47,694
This is so exciting.

712
00:37:47,832 --> 00:37:49,390
Di, how can you eat all that?

713
00:37:49,533 --> 00:37:51,228
She's eating for two.

714
00:37:52,203 --> 00:37:52,999
Jinx.

715
00:37:54,572 --> 00:37:56,972
Page one is
a plot summary of "Heat. "

716
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:59,269
Two has
my character summaries...

717
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:00,877
3 is my overall critique...

718
00:38:01,012 --> 00:38:02,245
and on 4 through 10
you'll find...

719
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:05,249
my Nexis search of all
prior analysis of this film.

720
00:38:05,549 --> 00:38:06,641
In summation...

721
00:38:06,751 --> 00:38:08,412
no part of "Heat"
is really applicable...

722
00:38:08,486 --> 00:38:10,920
to a grocery store
bank branch robbery.

723
00:38:11,055 --> 00:38:12,920
What the heck
is going on here?

724
00:38:13,491 --> 00:38:15,322
Jack! I can explain.

725
00:38:15,393 --> 00:38:17,759
Diane, there's no excuse...

726
00:38:17,928 --> 00:38:20,158
for not taking
your prenatal vitamins.

727
00:38:21,065 --> 00:38:23,265
I love you.

728
00:38:28,939 --> 00:38:29,733
Cleo?

729
00:38:31,676 --> 00:38:33,473
Would you just
say my name?

730
00:38:34,612 --> 00:38:35,670
Ted.

731
00:38:36,914 --> 00:38:39,212
Well, it's a laugh riot
for the whole family...

732
00:38:39,283 --> 00:38:42,013
and Tim Conway is just about
as funny as they come...

733
00:38:42,086 --> 00:38:43,883
especially in the scene where...

734
00:38:43,954 --> 00:38:44,943
Wait a minute.

735
00:38:45,022 --> 00:38:47,991
You watched "The Apple
fucking Dumpling Gang"?

736
00:38:48,426 --> 00:38:50,553
I'm only allowed "G" movies.

737
00:38:50,928 --> 00:38:53,556
Am I the only one
who cares about this?

738
00:38:53,798 --> 00:38:56,232
I mean, at least I watched
"Dog Day Afternoon. "

739
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,458
Excuse me.

740
00:38:57,601 --> 00:38:59,660
Could you try to keep
your voice down, please?

741
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:01,965
We're not introducing
anger into the womb.

742
00:39:02,139 --> 00:39:04,107
How would you like me
to introduce my foot...

743
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:05,699
into your ass?

744
00:39:06,277 --> 00:39:07,471
Kansas!

745
00:39:07,645 --> 00:39:08,778
I'm sorry, Diane...

746
00:39:08,813 --> 00:39:10,713
but I'm not gonna watch
my dreams fade away...

747
00:39:10,781 --> 00:39:11,873
because
the Virgin Mary here...

748
00:39:11,949 --> 00:39:14,509
thinks she can get ideas
from kiddie movies.

749
00:39:14,652 --> 00:39:16,119
Those of us
who have parents...

750
00:39:16,253 --> 00:39:18,016
know they have rules
because they care.

751
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:24,225
Are you sure you
want to go there?

752
00:39:26,764 --> 00:39:28,095
Maybe.

753
00:39:30,101 --> 00:39:30,829
You guys!

754
00:39:35,072 --> 00:39:36,006
How do you like that?

755
00:39:36,041 --> 00:39:36,995
Diane Weston?

756
00:39:37,074 --> 00:39:38,507
Kansas, quit it!

757
00:39:39,744 --> 00:39:40,938
Here.

758
00:39:46,117 --> 00:39:47,448
God, we're sorry.

759
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:48,711
It's off.

760
00:39:49,286 --> 00:39:50,685
I can't take
the fighting...

761
00:39:50,788 --> 00:39:53,313
the backstabbing,
the open hostility.

762
00:39:53,424 --> 00:39:55,517
We're not acting
like cheerleaders.

763
00:39:55,626 --> 00:39:58,117
We're acting like
a bunch of sorority girls.

764
00:40:00,765 --> 00:40:02,824
I'm sorry
I ever started this.

765
00:40:03,768 --> 00:40:04,928
Di, it's not your fault.

766
00:40:05,035 --> 00:40:06,798
We all wanted to do this.

767
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:08,030
Look...

768
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:10,637
maybe I can watch a PG movie.

769
00:40:11,175 --> 00:40:12,540
I'll just say I'm...

770
00:40:12,643 --> 00:40:15,111
counting dirty words
for Sunday school.

771
00:40:16,013 --> 00:40:17,776
It's OK, Hannah.

772
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:19,682
It was silly
to think that we can learn...

773
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:21,911
to rob a bank
from watching movies.

774
00:40:22,219 --> 00:40:23,709
Sex you can learn from movies.

775
00:40:23,788 --> 00:40:25,016
But robberies?

776
00:40:25,222 --> 00:40:26,689
Forget about it.

777
00:40:26,824 --> 00:40:27,916
Besides...

778
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:30,219
TV Land had a "Little House on
the Prairie" marathon...

779
00:40:30,361 --> 00:40:31,726
and the In galls made
baby Carrie's bed...

780
00:40:31,796 --> 00:40:33,093
from a dresser drawer.

781
00:40:33,164 --> 00:40:34,961
I guess I could just do that.

782
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:38,534
Oh, my God!

783
00:40:38,669 --> 00:40:40,534
The baby's got two heads.

784
00:40:40,738 --> 00:40:42,137
It's twins!

785
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:45,205
I'm not just super fat!

786
00:40:46,544 --> 00:40:48,409
Oh, OK, we ain't
done with this.

787
00:40:48,479 --> 00:40:50,470
Those babies are gonna have
a good start in life.

788
00:40:50,548 --> 00:40:52,948
With a real crib...
one that costs as hit load.

789
00:40:53,217 --> 00:40:54,309
We're gonna learn
how to rob a bank...

790
00:40:54,385 --> 00:40:56,717
by the only people who
really know how to do it:

791
00:40:56,954 --> 00:40:58,285
Criminals.

792
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:02,983
I'm gonna visit my mom.

793
00:41:15,955 --> 00:41:17,923
You don't look nothing
like your picture.

794
00:41:18,791 --> 00:41:22,226
Grandma and Grandpa sent you
a picture of a neighbor girl.

795
00:41:22,461 --> 00:41:23,723
They didn't want
you to...

796
00:41:23,829 --> 00:41:25,922
break out
and come kidnap me.

797
00:41:26,698 --> 00:41:27,687
Thank God.

798
00:41:27,866 --> 00:41:30,096
I was starting to think
I killed the wrong man.

799
00:41:32,604 --> 00:41:34,151
So, what did you
come here for?

800
00:41:34,185 --> 00:41:35,698
To tell me how much
you hate me?

801
00:41:35,807 --> 00:41:37,502
I don't hate you.

802
00:41:38,943 --> 00:41:40,605
I need your help.

803
00:41:41,213 --> 00:41:43,237
Now, how in the hell
can I help you?

804
00:41:44,148 --> 00:41:46,241
My best friend got pregnant.

805
00:41:47,084 --> 00:41:48,779
Before you?

806
00:41:52,022 --> 00:41:54,320
Yeah, I know.
That's what I said, too.

807
00:41:54,458 --> 00:41:55,822
Um, anyway...

808
00:41:55,993 --> 00:41:57,619
we want to help her get
some money for the baby...

809
00:41:57,694 --> 00:41:59,559
by robbing a bank.

810
00:42:00,196 --> 00:42:02,061
Well, shit fire, Kansas.

811
00:42:02,132 --> 00:42:04,464
That's the sweetest thing
I ever heard.

812
00:42:04,601 --> 00:42:06,669
But we can't quite
figure out how to...

813
00:42:06,704 --> 00:42:08,398
you know, how to do it.

814
00:42:08,838 --> 00:42:10,566
So you need my help?

815
00:42:11,473 --> 00:42:12,207
Oh, my God.

816
00:42:12,242 --> 00:42:14,709
This is like you asking me
for help with your homework.

817
00:42:19,548 --> 00:42:20,537
Hey, Mink.

818
00:42:20,716 --> 00:42:21,773
Come here.

819
00:42:25,154 --> 00:42:27,816
Kansas, I want you
to meet someone special.

820
00:42:31,325 --> 00:42:33,055
Jesus Christ, Mom.

821
00:42:33,194 --> 00:42:34,855
Like my life ain't
a great big pile of shit...

822
00:42:34,962 --> 00:42:36,156
'cause you're in here.

823
00:42:36,297 --> 00:42:38,788
Now I've gotta add
"P.S. My mom's a dyke," too?

824
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,827
Shut up, you mouthy little shit.

825
00:42:41,935 --> 00:42:43,927
Don't "mouthy shit" me.
I'm out of here.

826
00:42:44,005 --> 00:42:45,767
Hey, wait. Sit down.

827
00:42:46,339 --> 00:42:47,806
Now, I'm sorry.

828
00:42:47,908 --> 00:42:49,967
Mama's a little over amped...

829
00:42:50,243 --> 00:42:52,472
didn't get her yard time
this morning.

830
00:42:53,246 --> 00:42:56,113
Mink ain't my bitch,
if that's what you think.

831
00:42:57,551 --> 00:42:59,415
She's a specialist...

832
00:43:00,353 --> 00:43:01,718
in banks.

833
00:43:15,066 --> 00:43:16,967
Theme’s some sweet skirts
you got there.

834
00:43:17,101 --> 00:43:18,466
Oh, thank you!

835
00:43:18,570 --> 00:43:20,094
Actually,
they're uniforms.

836
00:43:20,171 --> 00:43:21,968
We're cheerleaders.

837
00:43:24,309 --> 00:43:25,969
You sure are.

838
00:43:27,145 --> 00:43:28,407
Excuse me.

839
00:43:30,047 --> 00:43:31,275
All right, same time tomorrow...

840
00:43:31,348 --> 00:43:33,441
we have a visit
with our favorite aunts.

841
00:43:36,486 --> 00:43:39,649
Listen, robbing banks
is like pulling a trick.

842
00:43:39,756 --> 00:43:41,246
You gotta stay in control...

843
00:43:41,324 --> 00:43:43,486
know how far you'll go
to get the dough...

844
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:46,221
and always put
the rubber on yourself.

845
00:43:48,031 --> 00:43:49,327
You know what I mean.

846
00:43:49,399 --> 00:43:51,662
Hey, and you gotta do it
the day after Christmas.

847
00:43:51,801 --> 00:43:52,560
Why?

848
00:43:52,668 --> 00:43:55,364
Banks don't have holiday
pickups, so vaults are full.

849
00:43:55,471 --> 00:43:57,995
Besides, everyone's
at home eatin' left overs...

850
00:43:58,073 --> 00:43:59,166
and beatin' their kids.

851
00:43:59,242 --> 00:44:01,766
Really?
You were cell mates with her?

852
00:44:02,143 --> 00:44:04,442
Oh, my God.
She was my hero!

853
00:44:04,547 --> 00:44:06,810
Did she tell you what
Letter man's house was like?

854
00:44:06,882 --> 00:44:08,950
You gotta buy your Gats
from the Terminator.

855
00:44:08,985 --> 00:44:10,747
Tell him Itchy sent you.

856
00:44:10,852 --> 00:44:11,944
And Gats are?

857
00:44:12,053 --> 00:44:13,714
Guns, cutie.

858
00:44:13,854 --> 00:44:16,483
You listen to Carol, pussycat.

859
00:44:16,624 --> 00:44:18,319
Go rent "National Velvet".

860
00:44:18,492 --> 00:44:21,256
It's got some awesome
steeple chases in it.

861
00:44:21,729 --> 00:44:23,219
I'm gonna write that down.

862
00:44:23,297 --> 00:44:25,492
So, although
their father said...

863
00:44:25,566 --> 00:44:28,057
Don't get out of the car
till I get back with help...

864
00:44:28,369 --> 00:44:30,394
they knew the sheriff's
voice when he yelled...

865
00:44:30,537 --> 00:44:33,403
Run to my voice!
And don't look back!

866
00:44:33,973 --> 00:44:35,339
The twins did as he said...

867
00:44:35,476 --> 00:44:36,966
but at the very last second...

868
00:44:37,043 --> 00:44:40,035
they turned around and saw
the escaped mental patient...

869
00:44:40,179 --> 00:44:42,647
bouncing their father's head
on top of the car.

870
00:44:44,950 --> 00:44:46,043
They jumped!

871
00:44:46,219 --> 00:44:47,709
That's just gas, sweetie.

872
00:44:50,589 --> 00:44:51,852
What are you working on?

873
00:44:52,058 --> 00:44:54,287
Just some girly stuff
for the squad.

874
00:45:12,977 --> 00:45:14,444
Well, whoever gets out alive...

875
00:45:14,512 --> 00:45:17,105
have the authorities check
in the crawl space.

876
00:45:17,747 --> 00:45:20,148
Kansas, you should never
judge a book by its cover.

877
00:45:24,689 --> 00:45:26,883
I guess there's an exception
to every rule.

878
00:45:28,324 --> 00:45:29,952
Could I help you?

879
00:45:30,527 --> 00:45:32,084
You're the Terminator?

880
00:45:32,728 --> 00:45:34,788
Did you come in here
to bust my balls?

881
00:45:35,265 --> 00:45:35,993
Huh?

882
00:45:36,099 --> 00:45:38,623
Well, I kill bugs for a living.

883
00:45:38,767 --> 00:45:40,530
If God doesn't beat you to it.

884
00:45:40,636 --> 00:45:42,103
No, wait, um...

885
00:45:42,237 --> 00:45:44,330
We're the "A" squad
from Lincoln High school.

886
00:45:44,407 --> 00:45:45,205
So, uh...

887
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:47,834
so, we were told
you could fix us up.

888
00:45:48,776 --> 00:45:50,438
Fix you up.

889
00:45:50,846 --> 00:45:51,971
Really.

890
00:45:52,046 --> 00:45:53,911
Yeah, Itchy sent us.

891
00:45:54,315 --> 00:45:55,840
She did, did she?

892
00:45:56,150 --> 00:45:57,515
How is the old girl?

893
00:45:58,553 --> 00:46:00,315
Definitely old.

894
00:46:01,456 --> 00:46:03,083
Yeah, that's my Itchy.

895
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:07,252
How many?

896
00:46:07,362 --> 00:46:08,555
Uh...

897
00:46:08,662 --> 00:46:09,560
Um, well...

898
00:46:09,629 --> 00:46:12,064
We'll each probably
want one, so...

899
00:46:12,399 --> 00:46:13,423
We'll take 5.

900
00:46:13,533 --> 00:46:14,500
5 should do it.

901
00:46:14,601 --> 00:46:15,329
All right.

902
00:46:15,435 --> 00:46:17,460
And, uh, how much ammo
do you want?

903
00:46:17,938 --> 00:46:18,905
Ammo?

904
00:46:19,039 --> 00:46:21,233
How many bullets do you need?

905
00:46:21,875 --> 00:46:23,740
Oh, bullets.

906
00:46:23,810 --> 00:46:24,909
No bullets.

907
00:46:24,944 --> 00:46:26,970
Oh, my gosh. These are
just to scare people.

908
00:46:27,047 --> 00:46:29,742
Kind of like around-off back
hand spring whip back double full.

909
00:46:29,849 --> 00:46:31,009
You never really use it.

910
00:46:31,083 --> 00:46:33,142
You just want the opposing squad
to know you've got it.

911
00:46:34,353 --> 00:46:35,615
OK.

912
00:46:36,187 --> 00:46:38,346
- $1,500 cash.
- What?

913
00:46:38,424 --> 00:46:40,891
You piece of shit bug zapper!

914
00:46:42,227 --> 00:46:44,889
Obviously that's a little more
than our budget will allow.

915
00:46:44,996 --> 00:46:49,729
Um, basically, we're looking
for something around $200.

916
00:46:49,901 --> 00:46:54,167
Oh, well,
why didn't you say so?

917
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:58,003
For 200, I got some
real nice rubber bands...

918
00:46:58,075 --> 00:46:59,566
and some sharp nails
in the back.

919
00:46:59,644 --> 00:47:02,146
I think I got 5 of them.
They come in pastel colors.

920
00:47:02,181 --> 00:47:04,010
Why don't you wait
right there...

921
00:47:04,046 --> 00:47:05,841
and let me go
gift-wrap it for you.

922
00:47:09,453 --> 00:47:12,088
They are 1,500
cash on the barrel.

923
00:47:12,124 --> 00:47:14,022
You take it or you leave it.

924
00:47:16,059 --> 00:47:17,325
Well, what kind of deal
would you make...

925
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:19,128
if I told you we were going
to go tell the police...

926
00:47:19,163 --> 00:47:21,096
that you're selling
illegal guns?

927
00:47:21,164 --> 00:47:22,529
To minors!

928
00:47:22,665 --> 00:47:24,325
To girl minors!

929
00:47:24,466 --> 00:47:26,196
Then I'd just
have to kill you.

930
00:47:27,669 --> 00:47:29,899
OK, well...

931
00:47:29,971 --> 00:47:31,598
it was a pleasure meeting you.

932
00:47:31,741 --> 00:47:33,298
Take care.

933
00:47:33,842 --> 00:47:35,025
Let's go, you guys.

934
00:47:35,061 --> 00:47:36,211
Hold it right there.

935
00:47:36,246 --> 00:47:37,235
Oh, please.

936
00:47:37,312 --> 00:47:38,835
We're not going
to tell anyone.

937
00:47:38,914 --> 00:47:40,676
Maybe we can make a deal.

938
00:47:40,781 --> 00:47:42,044
Look, buddy...

939
00:47:42,184 --> 00:47:44,413
we're not gonna
trade sex for guns.

940
00:47:45,586 --> 00:47:47,077
Unless Cleo...

941
00:47:47,155 --> 00:47:47,950
Kansas!

942
00:47:48,022 --> 00:47:49,488
I got a daughter.

943
00:47:49,523 --> 00:47:52,515
And she's always dreamt
of being a cheerleader.

944
00:47:53,327 --> 00:47:54,589
Aw.

945
00:47:54,728 --> 00:47:55,887
Tell you what I'll do.

946
00:47:55,962 --> 00:47:58,193
If you put her on your squad...

947
00:47:58,765 --> 00:47:59,831
and I mean put her
on the squad...

948
00:47:59,866 --> 00:48:01,468
don't make her haul around
your pompoms...

949
00:48:01,503 --> 00:48:03,163
you give her something to do...

950
00:48:04,070 --> 00:48:05,833
then I'll give you the guns.

951
00:48:07,373 --> 00:48:08,772
You're kidding.

952
00:48:12,010 --> 00:48:13,136
Hey, Fern!

953
00:48:13,446 --> 00:48:14,912
Fern, come here!

954
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:16,670
She's out back siphoning off
the tanks.

955
00:48:16,782 --> 00:48:19,046
It takes just a second
to cap off that cyanide hose.

956
00:48:19,184 --> 00:48:20,344
Honey!

957
00:48:20,719 --> 00:48:22,516
Oh, there she is.

958
00:48:22,987 --> 00:48:24,387
Here's my baby.

959
00:48:25,157 --> 00:48:27,182
Fern, meet your
new best friends.

960
00:48:30,295 --> 00:48:31,818
We'll be right back.

961
00:48:35,467 --> 00:48:36,797
Don't you take too long.

962
00:48:37,502 --> 00:48:39,765
Let's do breathing
exercises, shall we?

963
00:48:41,806 --> 00:48:43,670
Is Jack upset that
he can't be here?

964
00:48:44,407 --> 00:48:45,705
We worked it out.

965
00:48:49,279 --> 00:48:50,267
Doing good, sweetie.

966
00:48:50,548 --> 00:48:52,139
Let's remember our focal point.

967
00:48:54,684 --> 00:48:55,981
OK, don't stop now.

968
00:48:56,052 --> 00:48:57,747
Come on, we're gonna make it,
baby. Come on.

969
00:49:00,356 --> 00:49:02,153
What a sad waste of man.

970
00:49:02,992 --> 00:49:04,016
OK...

971
00:49:04,393 --> 00:49:05,761
Even with all our savings...

972
00:49:05,796 --> 00:49:07,897
it's still only 654.

973
00:49:07,932 --> 00:49:08,659
That's it?

974
00:49:08,731 --> 00:49:11,291
Hey, I even took my parents'
foster kid money.

975
00:49:11,699 --> 00:49:13,167
Philippe's going
to be gathering rice...

976
00:49:13,235 --> 00:49:15,065
without pants this month.

977
00:49:15,670 --> 00:49:18,162
OK, wait a second.
Hold on.

978
00:49:18,506 --> 00:49:20,440
Now, what do we do
before a big game?

979
00:49:20,542 --> 00:49:21,566
Use the bathroom...

980
00:49:21,643 --> 00:49:24,203
because the port-a-potties
on the field are gross.

981
00:49:25,713 --> 00:49:26,644
My fault.

982
00:49:26,781 --> 00:49:29,306
What do we do that enables us
to be as great as we are?

983
00:49:29,484 --> 00:49:31,062
I personally think
of how Conan...

984
00:49:31,098 --> 00:49:32,641
started as a writer,
and then...

985
00:49:32,753 --> 00:49:33,880
We practice.

986
00:49:33,988 --> 00:49:36,455
That's right.
Practice makes perfect.

987
00:49:36,657 --> 00:49:38,682
I'm practicing
to have a baby right now.

988
00:49:38,793 --> 00:49:39,986
If we do a practice job...

989
00:49:40,093 --> 00:49:41,822
we'll not only
get the experience...

990
00:49:41,929 --> 00:49:44,523
but we'll also get the money
we need for the guns.

991
00:49:45,065 --> 00:49:45,831
I've got the perfect job...

992
00:49:45,866 --> 00:49:47,560
and I've gotta pee,
so help me up.

993
00:49:51,571 --> 00:49:53,766
Hello.
How many would you like?

994
00:49:53,839 --> 00:49:55,101
Seven.

995
00:50:15,292 --> 00:50:17,350
- Hi.
- Hello. How many?

996
00:50:17,379 --> 00:50:18,760
Two, please.

997
00:50:22,032 --> 00:50:23,021
Oops!

998
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:33,366
Oh, please,
help me with her!

999
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,835
What the hell kind of food
are they serving us...

1000
00:50:59,870 --> 00:51:02,200
if they can turn
a prof it on 200 bucks?

1001
00:51:23,490 --> 00:51:24,924
Uh, Fern?

1002
00:51:24,992 --> 00:51:25,924
Yeah?

1003
00:51:25,993 --> 00:51:28,595
No more filling the tanks
before practice, OK?

1004
00:51:28,630 --> 00:51:29,754
OK.

1005
00:51:32,232 --> 00:51:34,096
So, you know,
what are you?

1006
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:36,259
Anorexic or bulimic?

1007
00:51:36,903 --> 00:51:38,927
Just skinny.

1008
00:51:40,539 --> 00:51:42,268
Don't make me hate you.

1009
00:51:48,414 --> 00:51:49,937
OK, let's get going.

1010
00:51:50,516 --> 00:51:52,780
My grandparents get back
from dinner at 4:30.

1011
00:51:57,056 --> 00:51:57,919
Ready?

1012
00:51:58,056 --> 00:51:59,455
OK!

1013
00:52:00,992 --> 00:52:02,358
What the hell...

1014
00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:03,726
Oh, no!

1015
00:52:03,761 --> 00:52:04,887
He Ikea'd us.

1016
00:52:04,962 --> 00:52:06,758
How many signs do
we need.

1017
00:52:06,830 --> 00:52:08,560
We're not supposed
to do this.

1018
00:52:08,666 --> 00:52:10,065
Look, maybe Lucy is right.

1019
00:52:10,134 --> 00:52:11,361
Maybe this is a sign.

1020
00:52:11,435 --> 00:52:12,367
Kansas?

1021
00:52:14,404 --> 00:52:15,837
That you down there?

1022
00:52:16,039 --> 00:52:17,734
Yeah, Grandma.
Me and the squad.

1023
00:52:17,841 --> 00:52:19,775
You girls
talking about boys?

1024
00:52:20,143 --> 00:52:22,007
Practicing kissing
your hand?

1025
00:52:23,947 --> 00:52:25,479
Yeah, you caught us.

1026
00:52:25,515 --> 00:52:27,399
Oh, well, then
I'll put some cookies...

1027
00:52:27,434 --> 00:52:29,286
at the top of the stairs
for you girls.

1028
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:30,718
Thanks, that'd be great.

1029
00:52:34,357 --> 00:52:35,949
You got that
big retarded girl...

1030
00:52:36,058 --> 00:52:37,422
down there with you?

1031
00:52:39,428 --> 00:52:41,588
Uh-huh,
yeah, Grandma.

1032
00:52:41,763 --> 00:52:43,865
Then I'll throw a few
more treats on the plate.

1033
00:52:43,900 --> 00:52:44,832
She doesn't mean that.

1034
00:52:44,867 --> 00:52:47,300
She kind of lost the old filter
with the last stroke.

1035
00:52:47,736 --> 00:52:48,998
Where's my smokes?

1036
00:52:49,104 --> 00:52:50,705
Oh, I'll have them for you right
before "Touched By An Angel".

1037
00:52:50,740 --> 00:52:51,504
Don't worry.

1038
00:52:51,539 --> 00:52:53,404
You damned well better.

1039
00:52:57,445 --> 00:52:59,345
Oh, this is great.
What do we do?

1040
00:52:59,380 --> 00:53:01,575
Threaten people with
a trunkful of parts?

1041
00:53:01,949 --> 00:53:03,610
I'm sorry, you guys.

1042
00:53:03,751 --> 00:53:05,519
When you're dealing with
south American rebels...

1043
00:53:05,553 --> 00:53:07,688
you kind of gotta to take
what you can get.

1044
00:53:07,723 --> 00:53:08,921
It's a trunkful of crap.

1045
00:53:08,955 --> 00:53:11,686
Excuse me, do you guys
know what I don't see here?

1046
00:53:12,059 --> 00:53:13,026
What?

1047
00:53:13,159 --> 00:53:14,786
I don't see a problem.

1048
00:53:14,894 --> 00:53:16,919
I see a great big
craft project...

1049
00:53:16,997 --> 00:53:18,588
sitting right
in front of me.

1050
00:53:18,698 --> 00:53:22,031
So, Kansas,
get me some glue...

1051
00:53:22,135 --> 00:53:24,569
some tape,
and a nail file.

1052
00:54:20,723 --> 00:54:23,292
Meanwhile, the most
important event of my life...

1053
00:54:23,327 --> 00:54:24,622
was about to take place.

1054
00:54:24,692 --> 00:54:27,663
Please join our "A" and "B"
squad cheerleaders...

1055
00:54:27,698 --> 00:54:30,153
in a salute
to winter sports!

1056
00:54:39,674 --> 00:54:42,074
The winter sports pep rally is
only, like...

1057
00:54:42,143 --> 00:54:44,906
the biggest cheerleading
event of the year.

1058
00:54:45,846 --> 00:54:48,144
I'd been practicing for months.

1059
00:54:48,782 --> 00:54:51,151
This was my big chance
to show the whole school...

1060
00:54:51,186 --> 00:54:53,711
that I really belonged
on the "A" squad.

1061
00:55:09,101 --> 00:55:11,001
I just want to say,
that normally,

1062
00:55:11,103 --> 00:55:12,831
I'm an excellent skater.

1063
00:55:12,937 --> 00:55:16,135
Some jealous fag,
who will remain nameless...

1064
00:55:16,375 --> 00:55:18,433
obviously sabotaged my skates.

1065
00:55:19,311 --> 00:55:20,868
I was completely humiliated...

1066
00:55:20,945 --> 00:55:23,243
In front of
the entire student body.

1067
00:55:24,816 --> 00:55:26,943
Talk about adding
insult to injury...

1068
00:55:27,218 --> 00:55:29,516
at the last minute,
Diane finagled putting...

1069
00:55:29,587 --> 00:55:32,784
that backwater mutant monkey
girl on top of the pyramid!

1070
00:55:33,557 --> 00:55:34,582
Yeah!

1071
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:36,518
No way!

1072
00:55:36,627 --> 00:55:39,027
It ruined the entire finale.

1073
00:55:39,229 --> 00:55:40,787
Ask anybody!

1074
00:55:51,208 --> 00:55:53,801
Conan O'Brien...

1075
00:55:54,911 --> 00:55:57,607
Conan O'Brien...

1076
00:55:58,481 --> 00:56:00,846
Conan O'Brien.
Conan O'Brien...

1077
00:56:00,949 --> 00:56:02,144
Come on, Cleo.

1078
00:56:02,218 --> 00:56:03,651
We're not gonna waste
this week's question...

1079
00:56:03,718 --> 00:56:05,447
to the nether world
on Conan.

1080
00:56:05,554 --> 00:56:07,851
Who made up the
one-question-a-week rule anyway?

1081
00:56:07,885 --> 00:56:10,147
It's in the Bible,
so just shut the hell up.

1082
00:56:10,292 --> 00:56:12,522
OK, OK. Here goes...

1083
00:56:12,895 --> 00:56:15,021
Is the day
after Christmas...

1084
00:56:15,130 --> 00:56:17,098
the best day
for the heist?

1085
00:56:19,100 --> 00:56:19,825
Yes!

1086
00:56:19,833 --> 00:56:22,564
Girls, numerology
confirms it, too. Look!

1087
00:56:22,837 --> 00:56:24,394
So does
"Soldier of Fortune".

1088
00:56:24,505 --> 00:56:27,269
A great day to go balls out
on the offensive.

1089
00:56:27,776 --> 00:56:30,243
Then it's time
for my mom's present.

1090
00:56:32,145 --> 00:56:35,877
Be careful. Have fun.
Ski masks are so done.

1091
00:56:36,015 --> 00:56:38,040
Wear these masks
to fight the power...

1092
00:56:38,217 --> 00:56:40,447
and never bend over
in the shower.

1093
00:56:40,653 --> 00:56:42,780
Hey, Diane, you can be
Mood-swing Betty.

1094
00:56:42,855 --> 00:56:43,981
Hannah, you're
Virgin Betty...

1095
00:56:44,091 --> 00:56:45,921
with optional
horse and saddle.

1096
00:56:46,859 --> 00:56:48,655
And Fern, you can be...

1097
00:56:49,162 --> 00:56:51,357
Oh, God, we forgot Fern.

1098
00:56:51,798 --> 00:56:52,764
Oh, it's OK.

1099
00:56:52,864 --> 00:56:54,890
My mom and the girls just
got them for the heist.

1100
00:56:54,968 --> 00:56:56,434
It's nothing personal.

1101
00:56:56,568 --> 00:56:59,162
Hey, I got to cheer
with you guys.

1102
00:56:59,638 --> 00:57:02,402
I'm happier than
a Make-A-Wish kid at Disneyland.

1103
00:57:02,541 --> 00:57:05,271
Well, we'll all
sign your yearbook.

1104
00:57:07,945 --> 00:57:10,004
Here, take mine.

1105
00:57:11,016 --> 00:57:13,210
Look, I didn't know
how to tell you guys...

1106
00:57:13,284 --> 00:57:16,277
but I got my scholarship.

1107
00:57:17,021 --> 00:57:18,613
I can't go
through with this.

1108
00:57:18,723 --> 00:57:20,656
But we went
hands in on this.

1109
00:57:20,825 --> 00:57:22,193
You're breaking
the National High school...

1110
00:57:22,228 --> 00:57:23,558
Cheerleading
Association's pledge...

1111
00:57:23,627 --> 00:57:25,686
of allegiance
and conformity.

1112
00:57:26,397 --> 00:57:28,956
I'll turn in my pompoms
after Christmas.

1113
00:57:29,399 --> 00:57:31,132
You know,
you guys are insane...

1114
00:57:31,167 --> 00:57:32,881
if you don't think
those criminals would...

1115
00:57:32,916 --> 00:57:34,596
gladly turn you in
for a pack of Lucky's.

1116
00:57:34,904 --> 00:57:36,200
Oh, yeah!

1117
00:57:36,306 --> 00:57:37,796
Well, unlike you,
those criminals...

1118
00:57:37,874 --> 00:57:39,671
take an oath,
and they stick with it.

1119
00:57:39,775 --> 00:57:41,003
You don't mess
with another in mate...

1120
00:57:41,076 --> 00:57:43,101
and you never mess
with her kid.

1121
00:57:44,146 --> 00:57:45,909
I'm sorry, Diane.

1122
00:57:54,223 --> 00:57:56,281
I could take Lucy's place.

1123
00:57:57,558 --> 00:57:59,185
You can be Terminator Betty.

1124
00:58:01,863 --> 00:58:03,763
Fight the power!

1125
00:58:23,916 --> 00:58:25,908
1, 2, 3!

1126
00:58:28,721 --> 00:58:29,984
Oh, God!

1127
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:35,728
Oh, honey...

1128
00:58:35,861 --> 00:58:37,419
Next Christmas...

1129
00:58:37,697 --> 00:58:39,459
I'm putting
a diamond in it.

1130
00:58:39,532 --> 00:58:41,466
I don't know
what to say.

1131
00:58:42,501 --> 00:58:44,627
Well, say you love me.

1132
00:58:45,670 --> 00:58:46,831
I love you.

1133
00:58:46,906 --> 00:58:48,566
I love you, too.

1134
00:58:57,549 --> 00:58:58,880
Oh, God, here's mine.

1135
00:58:58,949 --> 00:59:01,076
It's so lame.
It's not romantic or anything.

1136
00:59:01,151 --> 00:59:03,619
No, no, no, shh.
I'm gonna love it.

1137
00:59:05,689 --> 00:59:07,554
Ah, a gift certificate!

1138
00:59:07,624 --> 00:59:11,185
For a new paintjob
on the GTO.

1139
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:12,623
Yeah, I was thinking
that maybe you'd want...

1140
00:59:12,696 --> 00:59:14,526
to change the color
after Christmas.

1141
00:59:16,032 --> 00:59:16,998
Wow...

1142
00:59:17,033 --> 00:59:18,330
Do you like it?

1143
00:59:18,468 --> 00:59:22,564
I sold the car
to buy you that ring.

1144
00:59:25,141 --> 00:59:25,908
You're kidding?

1145
00:59:25,943 --> 00:59:27,101
No!

1146
00:59:28,811 --> 00:59:29,800
We don't have a car.

1147
00:59:31,313 --> 00:59:32,610
No.

1148
00:59:33,181 --> 00:59:35,275
Oh! Oh, sweetie.

1149
00:59:35,383 --> 00:59:36,281
Sweetie...

1150
00:59:42,624 --> 00:59:44,683
Kansas, listen to me.

1151
00:59:44,826 --> 00:59:46,486
Jack sold our getaway car.

1152
00:59:46,628 --> 00:59:48,925
It's some goddamn
"Gift Of The Magi" thing.

1153
00:59:49,096 --> 00:59:51,062
Oops, Mommy's sorry,
sweet peas.

1154
00:59:51,097 --> 00:59:53,029
Swearing is
the surest way to...

1155
00:59:53,934 --> 00:59:55,458
Oh, shit!

1156
00:59:55,736 --> 00:59:57,863
Mommy needs
a getaway car.

1157
01:00:10,016 --> 01:00:10,807
Jump in!

1158
01:00:10,884 --> 01:00:11,942
We can't stop!

1159
01:00:12,051 --> 01:00:13,951
The brakes are bad!

1160
01:00:14,787 --> 01:00:16,118
Come, Kansas,
let's hurry!

1161
01:00:16,189 --> 01:00:17,554
Fern, you've got to
slow down.

1162
01:00:17,657 --> 01:00:19,822
Oh, dear Lord... please don't let us
run over Kansas.

1163
01:00:19,992 --> 01:00:20,824
Help!

1164
01:00:20,859 --> 01:00:22,623
Get in! Quick!

1165
01:00:23,529 --> 01:00:24,587
The brakes are broken.

1166
01:00:24,696 --> 01:00:27,599
Grab my hand, Kansas.
Come on, Kansas!

1167
01:00:27,634 --> 01:00:30,090
Come on, give it a shot.

1168
01:00:40,278 --> 01:00:43,543
Oh, my God!

1169
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:51,778
Anyone bring
a next repair of panties?

1170
01:01:36,798 --> 01:01:37,526
Who are you?

1171
01:01:37,598 --> 01:01:39,565
The goddamn Bionic Woman?

1172
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:41,626
I just pulled it,
and it came off.

1173
01:01:41,769 --> 01:01:42,901
Great, this is great.

1174
01:01:42,936 --> 01:01:44,571
Now we have to enter
through the front door.

1175
01:01:44,606 --> 01:01:46,596
Look, it's not my fault.

1176
01:01:46,707 --> 01:01:49,005
Hey! God,
rule number 1:

1177
01:01:49,076 --> 01:01:51,305
You never take off the mask,
you hear me?

1178
01:01:51,444 --> 01:01:54,470
No matter what happens,
you never take off the mask.

1179
01:01:54,614 --> 01:01:57,048
I'm sorry, Kansas.

1180
01:01:57,116 --> 01:01:58,344
Oh! God, no.

1181
01:01:58,417 --> 01:02:00,418
Rule number 2: No names.

1182
01:02:00,453 --> 01:02:02,147
No goddamn names, you retard.

1183
01:02:02,254 --> 01:02:04,985
For Christ's sake,
White Trash Betty.

1184
01:02:05,091 --> 01:02:06,791
I didn't realize
the rules went into effect...

1185
01:02:06,826 --> 01:02:08,726
before we entered
the supermarket.

1186
01:02:09,028 --> 01:02:11,257
Well, use your head,
stalker Betty.

1187
01:02:11,830 --> 01:02:13,628
Bettys, stop it.

1188
01:02:14,065 --> 01:02:16,499
The best squad is one
that hopes for the best...

1189
01:02:16,568 --> 01:02:18,798
and prepares for the worst.
National High school...

1190
01:02:18,870 --> 01:02:21,134
Cheerleading
Association letter head.

1191
01:02:21,538 --> 01:02:23,597
Now, let's give a hands in.

1192
01:02:26,543 --> 01:02:28,704
We're ready, we're prepared...

1193
01:02:28,846 --> 01:02:31,337
and this is going to be
the best bank robbery ever...

1194
01:02:31,448 --> 01:02:32,540
because...

1195
01:02:32,650 --> 01:02:35,084
Cheerleaders kick...

1196
01:02:41,624 --> 01:02:42,556
It's me.

1197
01:02:42,625 --> 01:02:43,819
Lucy?

1198
01:02:44,027 --> 01:02:45,120
What the hell do you want?

1199
01:02:45,195 --> 01:02:48,027
I want to help.
I'm a part of this squad.

1200
01:02:48,131 --> 01:02:49,223
Oh, no.

1201
01:02:49,399 --> 01:02:52,163
You have committed
the ultimate sin.

1202
01:02:52,468 --> 01:02:55,265
You left your squad
to be with a guy.

1203
01:02:55,470 --> 01:02:57,632
And that guy is
the devil himself...

1204
01:02:57,774 --> 01:03:00,971
because only the devil would
turn you against your sisters.

1205
01:03:04,413 --> 01:03:05,675
Let's go.

1206
01:03:35,709 --> 01:03:37,733
What's this?

1207
01:03:53,958 --> 01:03:56,553
Get on the ground now!

1208
01:03:59,598 --> 01:04:01,200
We got tape.
Don't worry about it.

1209
01:04:01,234 --> 01:04:02,860
I said down!

1210
01:04:10,508 --> 01:04:12,203
OK, uh. Hello?

1211
01:04:12,377 --> 01:04:14,708
Yeah. Excuse me.
Yeah, hi.

1212
01:04:14,845 --> 01:04:16,646
Umm, are you robbing
the supermarket...

1213
01:04:16,682 --> 01:04:18,011
or the bank branch?

1214
01:04:18,115 --> 01:04:19,412
The bank.

1215
01:04:19,616 --> 01:04:20,844
OK, so...

1216
01:04:20,918 --> 01:04:22,215
do you want
everybody down...

1217
01:04:22,250 --> 01:04:23,513
or just the people
at the bank?

1218
01:04:24,688 --> 01:04:26,849
- All of you!
- Bank branch!

1219
01:04:29,992 --> 01:04:31,927
- Bank branch!
- All of you!

1220
01:04:33,330 --> 01:04:35,354
Will you shut up.
I'll handle this.

1221
01:04:36,098 --> 01:04:36,998
Bank branch only.

1222
01:04:37,033 --> 01:04:39,365
Everybody else, just go
on about your business.

1223
01:04:45,707 --> 01:04:46,969
Shit, this ain't working.

1224
01:04:47,042 --> 01:04:48,943
Everybody down!

1225
01:05:20,541 --> 01:05:22,371
That's an illegal dismount.

1226
01:05:33,418 --> 01:05:35,010
Oh, my God.

1227
01:05:35,188 --> 01:05:37,382
An "A" squad pompom string.

1228
01:05:37,823 --> 01:05:39,518
Keep your eyes
on the ground.

1229
01:05:39,624 --> 01:05:40,489
This is great.

1230
01:05:40,559 --> 01:05:42,288
How are we doing?

1231
01:05:44,729 --> 01:05:46,094
Quick. Big bills, big bills.

1232
01:05:46,164 --> 01:05:48,064
This here is bullshit!

1233
01:05:48,133 --> 01:05:49,531
That's what this is.

1234
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:50,692
Shit!

1235
01:05:50,768 --> 01:05:52,702
I'm fine here. Go on.

1236
01:05:54,105 --> 01:05:56,540
I ain't going to let
some piece of shit...

1237
01:05:56,607 --> 01:05:58,939
Betty doll tell
me what to do.

1238
01:05:59,143 --> 01:06:01,542
No sire Bob.

1239
01:06:03,414 --> 01:06:05,244
Freeze or meet Jesus, asshole!

1240
01:06:05,348 --> 01:06:08,419
Don't never use the Lord's son's
name in vain...

1241
01:06:08,453 --> 01:06:10,511
around these parts
in the U.S. Of A.

1242
01:06:14,591 --> 01:06:16,183
What the heck?

1243
01:06:21,597 --> 01:06:23,259
Uh, I forgot
to tell you.

1244
01:06:23,366 --> 01:06:26,061
Sometimes when the rebels
take the gun off a corpse...

1245
01:06:26,201 --> 01:06:28,363
some live rounds
get left in the clip.

1246
01:06:29,304 --> 01:06:30,862
Good to know.

1247
01:06:36,644 --> 01:06:38,703
Christ on a cracker.

1248
01:06:39,648 --> 01:06:41,274
All right,
you guys, let's go.

1249
01:07:07,107 --> 01:07:08,908
I'm here live at the scene
of today's...

1250
01:07:08,943 --> 01:07:10,273
highly unusual bank robbery...

1251
01:07:10,308 --> 01:07:11,604
speaking with an eyewitness.

1252
01:07:11,710 --> 01:07:12,735
Can you please tell
us a little bit...

1253
01:07:12,811 --> 01:07:13,607
about what happened
here today?

1254
01:07:13,679 --> 01:07:15,080
Yes. In fact, you're talking
to the right person...

1255
01:07:15,115 --> 01:07:16,275
because I am
walking evidence.

1256
01:07:16,382 --> 01:07:18,316
OK. One of them stepped
right on my...

1257
01:07:18,450 --> 01:07:21,043
OK? Excuse me, can you
get a shot of me here?

1258
01:07:21,119 --> 01:07:22,212
This is important, buddy.

1259
01:07:22,288 --> 01:07:24,847
Hello? Can you dust my...
for prints? This is important.

1260
01:07:25,256 --> 01:07:27,486
I can't believe you're
standing there, you idiot!

1261
01:07:28,459 --> 01:07:29,721
Wait, hold on, I forgot.

1262
01:07:29,827 --> 01:07:32,261
I have this. This is
really important...

1263
01:07:33,331 --> 01:07:35,230
That's very nice.
Thank you for your time.

1264
01:07:35,366 --> 01:07:37,664
Well, as you can see,
this crime here today...

1265
01:07:37,735 --> 01:07:39,794
is affecting people
very seriously.

1266
01:07:40,171 --> 01:07:40,966
If you haven't heard:

1267
01:07:41,071 --> 01:07:44,200
Today, 5 pregnant Betty
dolls robbed the bank.

1268
01:07:46,109 --> 01:07:47,973
Can you believe this?

1269
01:07:48,712 --> 01:07:50,680
We're like celebrities.

1270
01:07:50,814 --> 01:07:52,213
Better enjoy it now.

1271
01:07:52,348 --> 01:07:54,681
Because tomorrow some little
kid falls down a well...

1272
01:07:54,751 --> 01:07:57,310
and we're nothing
but a distant memory.

1273
01:08:00,423 --> 01:08:02,857
Disguises incinerated.

1274
01:08:05,428 --> 01:08:07,225
Oh, bad news, Di.

1275
01:08:07,330 --> 01:08:10,697
There was one thing we just
couldn't fit in the furnace.

1276
01:08:14,971 --> 01:08:16,562
Oh, my God.

1277
01:08:16,738 --> 01:08:18,672
Oh, you guys!

1278
01:08:18,806 --> 01:08:22,004
Thank you. Oh!

1279
01:08:22,744 --> 01:08:24,506
Can you believe we did it?

1280
01:08:25,112 --> 01:08:26,205
I mean...

1281
01:08:26,381 --> 01:08:27,507
We did it.

1282
01:08:28,449 --> 01:08:30,474
We really did it.

1283
01:08:38,259 --> 01:08:39,971
I guess no one
could have predicted...

1284
01:08:40,006 --> 01:08:41,685
the shit storm that
was about to hit.

1285
01:08:41,762 --> 01:08:44,355
I mean, the only thing people
cared about, thought about...

1286
01:08:44,464 --> 01:08:46,329
or talked about was the robbery.

1287
01:08:46,432 --> 01:08:49,333
Judging by the way the
robbers practically flew up...

1288
01:08:49,435 --> 01:08:51,561
to spray paint
the security cameras...

1289
01:08:51,737 --> 01:08:54,070
I think it was an Asian gang.

1290
01:08:54,741 --> 01:08:56,537
Yeah. Because as a people...

1291
01:08:56,642 --> 01:09:00,442
they tend to be quite
tiny and very acrobatic.

1292
01:09:03,583 --> 01:09:05,015
That's all it took.

1293
01:09:05,083 --> 01:09:06,380
Next thing you know...

1294
01:09:06,517 --> 01:09:09,316
Dim sum Charlie's
being hauled in for questioning.

1295
01:09:10,255 --> 01:09:13,850
From there, the town just
seemed to go apes hit.

1296
01:09:17,995 --> 01:09:19,826
That's her! That's her!

1297
01:09:21,599 --> 01:09:23,727
This thing spread faster
than a canker sore...

1298
01:09:23,801 --> 01:09:25,291
on the girls swim team.

1299
01:09:25,503 --> 01:09:27,237
Someone in Lincoln would
say something like...

1300
01:09:27,273 --> 01:09:28,670
They was dressed
like a bunch of...

1301
01:09:28,738 --> 01:09:31,104
freakin' Betty dolls,
for... sake.

1302
01:09:31,174 --> 01:09:33,574
They had these...
little voices...

1303
01:09:33,677 --> 01:09:36,475
and only
a bunch of... damn queers...

1304
01:09:36,546 --> 01:09:38,275
would shoot up
a union cap.

1305
01:09:38,448 --> 01:09:39,676
All of the sudden...

1306
01:09:39,749 --> 01:09:41,376
it's on "Jerry Springer".

1307
01:09:41,551 --> 01:09:43,651
This thing was definitely huge.

1308
01:09:43,686 --> 01:09:45,388
And welcome to the show.
Today, we're going to meet...

1309
01:09:45,423 --> 01:09:46,987
a growing number
of transvestites...

1310
01:09:47,023 --> 01:09:49,013
who just don't like
to dress up as women.

1311
01:09:49,124 --> 01:09:51,389
They like to dress up
as pregnant women.

1312
01:09:56,165 --> 01:09:56,959
Eric Karros...

1313
01:09:56,999 --> 01:09:58,801
It was like the whole country
had come down...

1314
01:09:58,835 --> 01:10:00,199
with Betty doll fever.

1315
01:10:00,234 --> 01:10:01,837
Left drive over
the left field wall...

1316
01:10:01,872 --> 01:10:04,066
into a waiting
pack of Bettys.

1317
01:10:06,240 --> 01:10:07,798
And then it finally happened...

1318
01:10:07,909 --> 01:10:09,774
the moment I had
been waiting for.

1319
01:10:09,944 --> 01:10:11,206
The little dip shits in blue...

1320
01:10:11,312 --> 01:10:13,212
finally followed up
on my evidence.

1321
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:21,547
Hi. I'm Kurt Loder
with an MTV News Brief.

1322
01:10:21,655 --> 01:10:23,987
Authorities now believe
a group of teenage girls...

1323
01:10:24,057 --> 01:10:26,224
are responsible for
the Betty doll bank robbery.

1324
01:10:26,258 --> 01:10:28,261
Stay tuned for my interview
with Alanis Morissette...

1325
01:10:28,296 --> 01:10:29,853
on the negative influence
of the Betty doll...

1326
01:10:29,930 --> 01:10:32,056
on young girls, right after this.

1327
01:10:36,535 --> 01:10:37,297
Hello?

1328
01:10:37,403 --> 01:10:39,701
It was Lucy.
Lucy went to the cops.

1329
01:10:39,805 --> 01:10:40,829
Remember, Kansas.

1330
01:10:40,940 --> 01:10:42,039
Every time you
point a finger...

1331
01:10:42,074 --> 01:10:43,666
you have three more
pointing back at you.

1332
01:10:43,809 --> 01:10:45,678
She's been the weak tit
on this mama cat...

1333
01:10:45,713 --> 01:10:47,042
since the beginning.

1334
01:10:47,445 --> 01:10:49,078
- That you?
- Yeah. Hold on.

1335
01:10:49,148 --> 01:10:50,046
Just call me later.

1336
01:10:50,116 --> 01:10:51,673
I got to get some
smokes for my grandma.

1337
01:10:51,816 --> 01:10:53,113
Don't use big bills.

1338
01:10:53,218 --> 01:10:55,379
For a pack of cigs?
I'll use her food stamps.

1339
01:10:56,788 --> 01:10:57,516
Hello?

1340
01:10:57,622 --> 01:10:58,451
We're dead.

1341
01:10:58,623 --> 01:11:01,217
They showed this prison movie
to my youth group on Sunday.

1342
01:11:01,359 --> 01:11:01,790
Hannah...

1343
01:11:01,826 --> 01:11:03,690
No, it wasn't like
the prison we saw.

1344
01:11:03,827 --> 01:11:05,352
All of these women had
to shave their heads...

1345
01:11:05,430 --> 01:11:07,920
because they got lice from
the filthy lives they lived.

1346
01:11:08,332 --> 01:11:11,529
Oh, no. I'm going to be
someone's bald bitch!

1347
01:11:12,269 --> 01:11:13,600
Oops. Hold on a second.

1348
01:11:13,737 --> 01:11:14,495
Hello?

1349
01:11:14,604 --> 01:11:16,038
Di? It's Luce.

1350
01:11:16,173 --> 01:11:18,767
Kansas just called and said
she's going to freak me up.

1351
01:11:18,975 --> 01:11:21,570
Then I heard coughing and a thud
and Kansas had to go.

1352
01:11:21,678 --> 01:11:23,872
I think her grandma had
another heart attack.

1353
01:11:23,980 --> 01:11:25,972
Anyway, why does
she want to freak me up?

1354
01:11:26,149 --> 01:11:27,446
She thinks you went
to the police.

1355
01:11:27,750 --> 01:11:29,083
What? That's insane.

1356
01:11:29,118 --> 01:11:30,915
Why would I go
to the police?

1357
01:11:31,788 --> 01:11:32,777
Relax. I've got to get that.

1358
01:11:32,855 --> 01:11:34,049
I'll see you tomorrow.

1359
01:11:34,489 --> 01:11:35,217
Hello?

1360
01:11:35,357 --> 01:11:37,451
My Sunday school teacher says
that in prison...

1361
01:11:37,593 --> 01:11:39,423
women shove broom sticks
up your...

1362
01:11:40,162 --> 01:11:41,288
Hold on.

1363
01:11:41,662 --> 01:11:42,561
Yeah?

1364
01:11:51,138 --> 01:11:52,469
Hello?

1365
01:11:54,508 --> 01:11:57,272
No. This is Diane. I think
you have the wrong number.

1366
01:11:58,412 --> 01:12:00,243
Oops. That's me.
Gotta go.

1367
01:12:00,481 --> 01:12:03,348
Wrong number? No!

1368
01:12:03,517 --> 01:12:04,245
Hello?

1369
01:12:04,318 --> 01:12:05,648
Di, I just called to say...

1370
01:12:05,719 --> 01:12:07,948
that Conan talked about us
again last night.

1371
01:12:08,221 --> 01:12:10,156
Thanks, Cleo.
See you tomorrow.

1372
01:12:13,193 --> 01:12:14,854
Morning, sunshine.

1373
01:12:15,228 --> 01:12:17,957
Remember, except for
the morning sickness...

1374
01:12:18,231 --> 01:12:19,596
the blinding back pain...

1375
01:12:19,732 --> 01:12:21,461
and the embarrassingly
unpredictable gas...

1376
01:12:21,601 --> 01:12:24,091
these are the best days
of your life, so far.

1377
01:12:27,439 --> 01:12:29,736
Hey, hey, hey.
Not so fast.

1378
01:12:30,175 --> 01:12:32,040
Following your dream
isn't a crime.

1379
01:12:32,277 --> 01:12:33,744
Nobody suspects you.

1380
01:12:34,078 --> 01:12:35,637
Nobody even has a clue.

1381
01:13:13,415 --> 01:13:14,939
Hey, guys.

1382
01:13:15,618 --> 01:13:17,610
Someone not take a shower today?

1383
01:13:18,020 --> 01:13:21,546
Hey, Lisa, did you run into
Carmen Electra last summer?

1384
01:13:21,990 --> 01:13:22,854
No.

1385
01:13:22,958 --> 01:13:24,059
Oh, because it
looks like you got...

1386
01:13:24,094 --> 01:13:25,321
some of her tits on you.

1387
01:13:27,862 --> 01:13:28,662
This just came from...

1388
01:13:28,696 --> 01:13:30,960
the National High school
Cheerleading Association.

1389
01:13:31,432 --> 01:13:32,694
You guys might
want to look it over...

1390
01:13:32,799 --> 01:13:34,131
before you try any more
cradle dismounts...

1391
01:13:34,202 --> 01:13:35,601
from double-based
partner stunts...

1392
01:13:35,670 --> 01:13:38,832
that are over shoulder stand
level without using 3 catchers.

1393
01:13:40,875 --> 01:13:44,504
Oh, or before you think about
robbing another bank.

1394
01:13:45,946 --> 01:13:48,005
What did she say?
How does she know?

1395
01:13:48,415 --> 01:13:49,346
Move it, people.

1396
01:13:49,415 --> 01:13:52,010
FBI. FBI. Freeze!

1397
01:13:58,157 --> 01:14:00,819
I'm sorry to bother you, ma'am,
but is this gonna take long?

1398
01:14:00,928 --> 01:14:01,757
It's game night.

1399
01:14:01,861 --> 01:14:03,123
Face front.

1400
01:14:05,631 --> 01:14:07,066
Are you sure
they can't see us?

1401
01:14:07,101 --> 01:14:08,465
One-way mirror, ma'am.

1402
01:14:08,935 --> 01:14:12,234
Picture in 3, 2, 1.

1403
01:14:17,108 --> 01:14:18,040
Excuse me, ma'am.

1404
01:14:18,143 --> 01:14:19,667
On "Law & Order," they get
to make one phone call.

1405
01:14:19,844 --> 01:14:21,813
I need to call
the fat her of my babies.

1406
01:14:28,719 --> 01:14:30,778
It's a fungus.
Leave it alone.

1407
01:14:31,555 --> 01:14:33,750
There's nothing I can
do about it. Hello?

1408
01:14:33,857 --> 01:14:36,381
Lisa, it's Diane.
We need to talk.

1409
01:14:38,996 --> 01:14:40,929
And that's why I came forward.

1410
01:14:40,998 --> 01:14:43,023
I mean, even the kids
on the short bus...

1411
01:14:43,133 --> 01:14:44,225
can see that all
the evidence...

1412
01:14:44,401 --> 01:14:46,664
points to Diane
and the "A" squad.

1413
01:14:46,936 --> 01:14:48,870
Oh, it sure does.

1414
01:14:49,372 --> 01:14:51,040
Your testimony will
prove in valuable...

1415
01:14:51,075 --> 01:14:53,166
Unfortunately,
it wasn't them.

1416
01:14:55,211 --> 01:14:56,939
They were all waiting
in my suburban that day...

1417
01:14:57,012 --> 01:14:59,538
while I ran into
the supermarket for some cash.

1418
01:15:01,950 --> 01:15:03,942
We were on our way to practice.

1419
01:15:05,020 --> 01:15:07,682
Well, better get going.

1420
01:15:08,222 --> 01:15:10,783
Nobody ever got ahead
by sitting on their behind.

1421
01:15:19,166 --> 01:15:21,259
Hey! Over here!

1422
01:15:21,535 --> 01:15:23,196
Is that Lisa?

1423
01:15:23,504 --> 01:15:25,267
What's she doing here?

1424
01:15:27,074 --> 01:15:28,006
Come on.

1425
01:15:32,345 --> 01:15:34,313
They let you guys
keep your mug shots?

1426
01:15:34,914 --> 01:15:36,041
I don't get it, Lisa.

1427
01:15:36,183 --> 01:15:38,047
Why did you tell the cops
that we were with you?

1428
01:15:38,184 --> 01:15:39,708
Look, you guys,
a failure to plan...

1429
01:15:39,786 --> 01:15:41,185
is a plan for failure.

1430
01:15:41,388 --> 01:15:42,753
We needed an alibi.

1431
01:15:42,889 --> 01:15:45,584
And I'm not going to be doing
back handsprings anytime soon.

1432
01:15:45,724 --> 01:15:47,352
What's in it for her?

1433
01:15:48,094 --> 01:15:52,190
Well, the "A" squad is going
to need a new captain soon.

1434
01:15:52,399 --> 01:15:53,695
You can't be serious!

1435
01:15:53,799 --> 01:15:56,266
Lisa really does
know all the rules.

1436
01:16:00,638 --> 01:16:02,971
Look! If it wasn't
for my alibi...

1437
01:16:03,075 --> 01:16:05,372
you'd all be doing college
by correspondence.

1438
01:16:08,514 --> 01:16:10,447
Get away from me!

1439
01:16:14,952 --> 01:16:16,214
Diane!

1440
01:16:16,287 --> 01:16:17,810
God, roll down a window!

1441
01:16:17,921 --> 01:16:19,048
Sorry, it just slipped out.

1442
01:16:19,357 --> 01:16:20,345
OK!

1443
01:16:20,457 --> 01:16:22,448
Funny how things work out
in the end.

1444
01:16:22,726 --> 01:16:24,558
Diane turned in her pompoms...

1445
01:16:24,696 --> 01:16:26,925
and I'm the new
"A" squad captain.

1446
01:16:27,030 --> 01:16:30,124
After all, National High school
Cheerleading Association...

1447
01:16:30,200 --> 01:16:32,667
rule number one:
Always stand behind...

1448
01:16:32,735 --> 01:16:34,202
your fellow cheerleaders...

1449
01:16:34,304 --> 01:16:36,363
especially when they're
7 months pregnant,

1450
01:16:36,439 --> 01:16:39,566
locked in a holding tank,
and looking at 15 to life.

1451
01:16:40,410 --> 01:16:42,172
Actually, I made
that last little bit up...

1452
01:16:42,244 --> 01:16:44,404
but you know what I mean.
