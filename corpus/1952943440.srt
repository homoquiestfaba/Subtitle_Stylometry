2
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:11,064
Okay. There's three flags,
eight races.

00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:13,775
The best freerunners
in the city of Metro.

4
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:17,779
The one who captures all three
flags, any way he can, wins.

5
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:23,785
He's 6 feet.
He's flying, he's flipping.

6
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:26,788
Speed-demon mayhem.
Odds to win, 4-to-1.

7

Ryan.

8
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:33,545
Five feet, 2 inches of
rabbit-quick reflexes. Kid Elvis.

9
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:38,508
Mitch, 5 foot 8 inches of
smash-mouth racing excitement.

10
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:42,137
He's known for his
jet-propelled jumps. Decks.

11
00:03:46,684 --> 00:03:49,770
At 5 foot 8,163,
an unstoppable force, Turk.

12
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:56,818
A precision jumper with four wins

13
00:03:59,113 --> 00:04:03,242

00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:12,458
With seven wins this month...

17
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:15,504
...one word to describe him:
relentless.

18
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:18,465
Finch. Finch. Finch.

19
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:23,095
All bets in, the race is on.

20
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:26,682
You gotta see this.
Ryan got the first two flags.

21
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:30,227
Miles, I just want him to be okay.
Just tell me Ryan's okay.

22
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:32,646
- Where is he?
He took a shortcut.

23
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:00,733
Whoo! Nice hat.

24
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:10,869
Whoa! Oh!

25
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,080
My God! Finch got the last flag.

26
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:17,042
I know, Kid Elvis. I was there.

27
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:29,137
Mitch the bitch. Come and get it.

28
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,793
Right behind you, man.
Ain't gonna make it.

29
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:11,054
I'm going over there.

30
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:15,934
Way to go, Finch!
There you go, son.

31
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:20,646
Now, there's a champion.

32
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:22,648
- Crazy son of a bitch.
He got lucky.

33
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:24,943
That could've killed you.
What happened?

34
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:27,070
Finch happened.
This is a champion.

35
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:29,698
A true champion.
The winner, Finch!

36
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:35,327
This is gonna be fun.

37
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:42,502
That satellite feed
for tomorrow's Launch...

38
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:45,380
...is online, Mr. Frank.

39
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:49,509
Thank you, Jacque.

40
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:58,226
- Any way you can, right?
- Any way you can, kid. You're right.

41
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:01,438
- That's what you're teaching them?
- Yeah, why? What's the problem?

42
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:03,815
- You must be real proud.
- I am. Look at him.

43
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:07,068
Look at him.
What's the matter with you?

44
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:12,656
Ryan.

45
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:16,578
- Hell of a race.
- if you say so.

46
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:18,705
Look. Just keep at it, okay?

47
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:20,874
Yeah, I know. Tomorrow, right?

48
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:24,085
Yeah. There's always tomorrow.

49
00:08:24,253 --> 00:08:26,129
Not the way that son of a bitch runs.

50
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:29,466
Don't worry about him.
That's history. Come here.

51
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:32,928
Get yourself off to a doctor.
Have him give you the once-over.

52
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:35,764
- That's it?
- No, that's just for the doctor.

53
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:38,016
You'll get the rest tonight, hey?

54
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,144
How much you make
on the race today, Reese?

55
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:52,572
There's always tomorrow, kid.

56
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:55,158
Don't you ever forget that.
There's always tomorrow.

57
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:58,370
Everybody move! Get out! Get out!

58
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,914
Let's go, baby.
Let's go, let's go!

59
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:07,671
Reese, baby, I still don't get it.

60
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:09,839
Okay, Dolores.

61
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,050
I'm gonna explain this
to you one last time.

62
00:09:13,427 --> 00:09:17,055
At the beginning of every race,
there's three bandanas.

63
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:20,850
A green one,
a yellow one and a red one.

64
00:09:21,018 --> 00:09:23,728
The kid that brings in
all three bandanas...

65
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:26,106
...any way he can, wins the money.

66
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:29,234
But they can bet on
themselves and fix the race.

67
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,736
I told them I'd break the legs
of any freerunner...

68
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:33,446
...that bet on the races.

69
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:35,782
Yeah, but I'm watching it
on my phone.

70
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:38,326
That's because we put
cameras on all the roofs.

71
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:41,037
And we attach Bluetooth cameras
to all the runners.

72
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:44,749
And the kids eat that shit up.
Then I had this idea.

73
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:48,169
Put it online and make
the kids run against each other.

74
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,880
And boom, baby.

75
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:54,426
It takes off like wildfire.

76
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:58,555
Genius. Wouldn't you say,
princess?

77
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:13,069
- You coming in for a cuddle?
Hey, baby

78
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:17,240
Oh, wait. Can you shift
to the right a little bit?

79
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:20,952
- Uh-huh.
- All right. Hold on.

80
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,204
All right. Okay.

81
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:25,790
Maybe we should be
icing those bruises.

82
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,958
Nah, I'm fine.

83
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:30,629
Let's just lay here
and enjoy paradise.

84
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,466
Smell that salt air?

85
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:38,553
You mean the pollution?

86
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:40,889
Which gives us
these amazing sunsets.

87
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:46,853
You know, we used to talk about
moving closer to the ocean.

88
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:50,148
What happened?

89
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:52,734
Life happened.

90
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:58,073
I've got to get ready for work, baby.

91
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:01,785
Are you bartending
or singing tonight?

92
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:04,204
Singing. Can you come by?

93
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:07,707
Yeah, I'm gonna work at the hospital
and see my gramps for a bit.

94
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:10,752
- I'll come by after.
- Okay. I'm on at 9.

95
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:13,630
- I'll catch a later set?
- Whatever.

96
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:17,300
If that's your plan, that's your plan.

97
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:26,810
Reese. Reese.

98
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:32,524
You used to be one of the leading
heavyweight contenders of the world.

99
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:37,320
Entrenched with the game of life.

100
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:40,949
And now you work for me.

101
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:44,119
Count it if you want.

102
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,914
No, Mr. Frank. it's fine. I trust you.

103
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:55,839
I gotta get us out of here.

104
00:11:56,006 --> 00:11:57,841
Me, Chelsea, my gramps.

105
00:11:57,842 --> 00:11:59,842
Get him out of that pit of a hospital.

106
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:02,762
Get us to the coast. Fix the boat up.

107
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:05,056
Man, I'm so damn broke.

108
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:09,936
Can't bet on the races,
can't bet on myself.

109
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:12,105
Wait a minute.

110
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:20,989
I don't know.
Didn't Reese say he'd kill you...

111
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:22,574
...you place a bet on yourself?

112
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:24,868
Yeah, if I bet on the race.

113
00:12:25,035 --> 00:12:28,663
IfI bet on the race. But...

114
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:34,252
...what if I deposit all of
my money into your account?

115
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,422
Then you could place a bet, right?

116
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:40,675
Yeah. Yeah, dude.

117
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:42,927
Say the word. Done.

118
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:49,517
Dude, what the hell are you doing?

119
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:52,645
Dude, I'm hacking into
the government's...

120
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:54,856
...experimental software programs,
all right?

121
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:57,609
They have the next 200 years
of software ready to go.

122
00:12:57,818 --> 00:12:59,818
Check this out, look.

123
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:03,198
It's these damn conglomerates
that just parcel it out to us...

124
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:05,365
- ... like cheese.
- I'm late for work.

125
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:08,244
- We're just rats in their cyber maze.
- Gotta go. Good luck.

126
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:10,412
I'll tell you Later.

127
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:19,566
Would you hold still, Gramps?

128
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:23,361
Hold still? For chrissake, you're
holding a straight razor to my neck.

129
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:24,946
Where am I gonna go?

130
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:27,574
If you stopped talking,
I'd probably be finished by now.

131
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,950
You know, I wanna lay down
and relax.

132
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:32,370
Check that out. What do you think?

133
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:35,081
It's not bad. Smooth.

134
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:37,000
Did a good job, kid.

135
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:39,002
Well, you didn't make it easy,
now, did you?

136
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:41,588
Nothing great came from easy.

137
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:44,424
Except great sex from easy women.

138
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:47,635
How'd I know you were gonna
go somewhere dirty like that?

139
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:50,263
It shows. There's a little sign
up here that says "dirty. "

140
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:55,476
All right. What do you
wanna watch on TV right now?

141
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:57,604
I don't know.

142
00:14:57,605 --> 00:15:01,608
Let's sit here and just talk
to each other for a Little bit.

143
00:15:01,775 --> 00:15:04,652
Okay. Anything in particular?

144
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:08,448
I don't know.
Turn on the goddamn TV again.

145
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:10,283
I don't care.

146
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:13,369
I was looking at those
pictures earlier today.

147
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,831
You spend all your
break time in my room?

148
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:19,459
What, do you come in here
and look at everything?

149
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:23,046
Sometimes. Remember that day?

150
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:25,381
Hell, I remember it well.

151
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:27,717
Your dad caught three groupers.

152
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:31,220
It was a miracle. Funny.

153
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:33,640
Handsome kid just like you.

154
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:35,807
He fell off the same pot.

155
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:38,061
God only knows
where we got it from, hey?

156
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:41,481
You know, sometimes, kid,
a toad and a swan get together...

157
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:44,859
...and make something
pretty special.

158
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:47,445
What are you talking about?
You're not a toad.

159
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:50,198
I wasn't thinking about me,
I was talking about Grandma.

160
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:54,118
No, that's okay.
She was down with that.

161
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:58,247
She understood.
We kidded a lot. Yeah, she did.

162
00:15:58,415 --> 00:16:00,667
So, what about that boat?
Where is it?

163
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:03,044
Still there. Dry dock.

164
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:06,422
Yeah, the boat's all eaten up
by now anyway.

165
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:10,468
Rats and termites and muskrats,
whatever eats wood.

166
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:13,429
- But it's there?
- Yeah, it's still there.

167
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:15,848
I bet I could fix it, Gramps.

168
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:18,393
I know you could, kiddo.

169
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:21,312
You can be good
at anything you want.

170
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:24,189
I just don't Like you working here.

171
00:16:24,858 --> 00:16:26,609
Enough of this male bonding thing.

172
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:29,028
You wanna watch some TV?
You wanna watch the game?

173
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:31,196
Yeah, put the game on.

174
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:55,555
d Driving along
I hear a song d

175
00:16:55,723 --> 00:17:02,223
d It brings back a time
I thought I left behind d

176
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:05,189
d The hate I once had d

177
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:08,401
d Melts into what I want d

178
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:13,489
d This doesn't help me
To get over us d

179
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,534
d And I can't go on
Any further d

180
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:22,290
d 'Cause I know
I'm back to my old habits d

181
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:28,671
d Falling into your trap
I can't let you out of my head d

182
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:32,133
d And I want to so bad
I've been here before d

183
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:37,430
d Can't take it no more
There's no use holding on d

184
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:42,727
d It's already been done d

185
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:48,816
d Yeah, it's already been done dd

186
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,363
Ladies and gentlemen,
another round of applause...

187
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:57,325
...for Kitty Kat Club's own Chelsea.

188
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:01,913
Come on.
Just here to pick up my girl.

189
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,914
Boss said no.

190
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:15,802
- He's a good man, Dedee.
- He's a good kid...

191
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:19,138
...but none of them are men,
and that's the problem, Chelsea.

192
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:22,683
I mean, West is, um...

193
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:27,146
Oh, my God. I don't even wanna
tell you how good he is in bed.

194
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:29,982
But do I think for a second
it's serious with him?

195
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,984
- Why not?
- Chelsea.

196
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:33,319
They're freerunners.

197
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:36,280
Just the kind of guy you wanna
bring home to meet the P's.

198
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:39,200
Dad, this is West.

199
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:41,368
Hey, West. What do you do?

200
00:18:41,411 --> 00:18:43,788
Well, dude, I Like to climb shit, party...

201
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:46,457
...and beat the crap
out of my friends.

202
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:48,876
The band is out there
waiting for you.

203
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:51,254
I gotta tell you this
every goddamn time?

204
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:53,421
Sorry, Morris.

205
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:56,384
I'm just saying, Chelse.

206
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:58,803
Break a Leg, Dedee.

207
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:05,560
On second thought,
break them both.

208
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,566
What is she just saying?

209
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:14,485
- What do you want, Morris?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wow.

210
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:18,656
Okay. Is that where
our relationship is right now?

211
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:20,824
There is no relationship, Morris.

212
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:23,911
Never has been, never will be.

213
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:31,002
d Bein' blue, bein' blue d

214
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:34,547
Touch me one more time
and you're gonna lose the hands.

215
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:37,425
- You're such a tease.
- You're such a pervert!

216
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:39,593
Ha-ha. And proud of it.

217
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:44,891
Come on, baby. Let's do it.

218
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:46,976
Stay away from me!

219
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:49,144
Come on!
Let her go!

220
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:51,521
What the fuck, Morris?

221
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:54,983
You're fired!

222
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:59,112
I'm calling the cops.

223
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:02,783
That guy's a jerk.

224
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:05,536
I know.

225
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:07,330
Maybe this all happened...

226
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:11,626
...as part of some bigger,
cosmic master plan.

227
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:14,712
And what is this bigger,
cosmic master plan?

228
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,590
I'll tell you on the way.
Come on, let's go.

229
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:21,510
That's a crazy plan, Ryan.

230
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:24,764
You want me to stop racing
and you want to get out of the city.

231
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:26,432
This is our chance.

232
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:28,433
But you said Reese
would break the legs...

233
00:20:28,518 --> 00:20:30,811
...of any freerunner
who bets on themselves.

234
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:32,647
That's where Miles comes in.

235
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:34,941
Oh, so you got
my stepbrother involved.

236
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:38,526
All I know is after the race today...

237
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:40,446
...something just clicked.

238
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:43,282
- Yeah, it's called a concussion.
- No, it was a revelation.

239
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:46,410
Seriously, I've had enough of this.

240
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:49,830
It's time we make our dreams come
true and get out of this place.

241
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:52,416
It's dangerous.

242
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:55,169
Where the hell are we?

243
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:57,755
Reese is throwing a party
for us around the corner.

244
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:00,549
It's supposed to be
for all the freerunners.

245
00:21:00,717 --> 00:21:05,137
But it could be
our going-away party, right?

246
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:07,514
Right?

247
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:10,225
I'm right, right?

248
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:12,645
Where is the party?

249
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:14,146
It's around the corner.

250
00:21:14,147 --> 00:21:16,440
Baby, let's just have
fun tonight, okay?

251
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:53,561
Last race tomorrow, boys.

252
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:57,064
Get them down.
Yeah, drink up, drink up.

253
00:22:23,925 --> 00:22:26,093
Ryan, you asked me
how much money I made, right?

254
00:22:26,261 --> 00:22:29,013
- Let's have a talk.
Okay.

255
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:33,768
If I hear that you've
been running around...

256
00:22:33,935 --> 00:22:36,937
...blabbing your mouth off
about what I'm doing to anybody...

257
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:40,024
And I mean anybody,
the fans, the freerunners.

258
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:42,234
...I'm gonna punch
a hole in your heart.

259
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:45,153
Do I make myself clear?

260
00:22:45,238 --> 00:22:48,240
Look at me.
Do I make myself clear?

261
00:22:48,408 --> 00:22:50,408
Crystal.

262
00:22:50,577 --> 00:22:52,577
- Good.
Are you guys having fun...

263
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:56,499
- ... or what?
- We're always having fun, sweetheart.

264
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:58,417
Cheers.

265
00:22:58,418 --> 00:23:00,961
Look at you. Ain't you a picture?

266
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:03,172
You know we have a saying
back in London...

267
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:06,967
...for somebody who gets
a prize like this?

268
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:10,096
You've absolutely rung
the bell, son. All right?

269
00:23:10,263 --> 00:23:13,015
Be nice to her. She's a winner.
All right.

270
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:15,768
Remember what I said to
you. Come, baby, let's go.

271
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:18,771
Hey, there's always tomorrow.
See you.

272
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:26,320
I don't like that guy. What's wrong?

273
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:27,696
Nothing.

274
00:23:27,697 --> 00:23:31,575
Hey, I know you. What's wrong?

275
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:35,996
It's just been a really
long day, baby. That's all.

276
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:39,250
Come on.
Oh.

277
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:45,213
Let's go.

278
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:51,262
So, I could rent the boat
out for tours...

279
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:55,683
...and you could
get a job singing at a club.

280
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:57,851
I'm scared. I don't know.

281
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:01,020
it'll be amazing.
- Just the condoms?

282
00:24:01,064 --> 00:24:03,064
Uh... Yeah, just the condoms.

283
00:24:08,363 --> 00:24:12,491
Not going through. Harry!
Lucky Condoms?

284
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:14,827
Condoms? Which condoms? Lucky?

285
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:17,413
- Lucky Condoms.
Lucky Condoms?

286
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:19,999
- Lucky!
- Yes! Lucky!

287
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:23,544
I'm Mr. Lucky and
I'm getting lucky with this girl.

288
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,840
Crashed.

289
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:33,053
See? So much for
getting lucky, smart boy.

290
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:39,977
We should sell it all.
- My car?

291
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:42,145
Everything.

292
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:44,440
- I'm not selling the Volvo.
- Fine.

293
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:50,404
- What?
- You're forgetting one thing.

294
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:53,866
- What?
- You've never beaten him.

295
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:56,368
You've never beaten Finch.

296
00:24:56,828 --> 00:25:00,956
I won't lose.
I won't ever let you down.

297
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:04,084
You promise?

298
00:25:04,085 --> 00:25:06,378
I promise.

299
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:21,268
Hey, it's Ryan. Leave a message.

300
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:22,645
Ryan, it's Miles.

301
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:25,022
We're selling yourself
before the race today, right?

302
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,566
I'm at the cyber cafe.
We doing this or not?

303
00:25:27,734 --> 00:25:29,276
It's your plan. Big money day.

304
00:25:29,277 --> 00:25:31,277
Last race in the season.
Rise and shine.

305
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:32,780
Are you meeting my brother?

306
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:36,200
Yeah. I told him that
we'd meet at the cyber cafe.

307
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:38,619
Hey, whatever, dude.
It's your plan, okay?

308
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:41,121
I'm just a cog in the wheel
of the machine here.

309
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:42,831
Shut up, Miles.

310
00:25:42,832 --> 00:25:44,792
you shut up.
Ryan told me to call.

311
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:47,086
He didn't tell you
to be so annoying.

312
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:51,382
Miles, we'll meet at the
cyber cafe in a half hour, okay?

313
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:54,385
Copy that. Oh, Chelsea?

314
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:56,553
What?

315
00:25:57,264 --> 00:25:59,264
Disgusting.

316
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:03,685
Baby.

317
00:26:06,356 --> 00:26:09,608
I don't want you to do this
for me or my grandfather.

318
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:11,151
You can stay if you want.

319
00:26:11,152 --> 00:26:13,612
I want you to do this because
it's what you wanna do.

320
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:15,948
Shut up.

321
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:58,741
This piece of shit?

322
00:26:58,742 --> 00:27:02,202
I'll give you
one, two, three, four, five...

323
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:04,413
...six, seven, eight, nine and 10.

324
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:06,123
Well, that's it.

325
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:08,459
you sold all your stuff, man?
I can't believe it.

326
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:10,252
We got, like, over eight grand.

327
00:27:10,253 --> 00:27:12,253
It's time for you to place that bet.

328
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:16,300
You better win, dude.
Yeah.

329
00:27:16,926 --> 00:27:18,177
And you see that?

330
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:21,388
You can have virtual friends
online, Gramps.

331
00:27:21,556 --> 00:27:24,642
I have virtual friends.
They're called my friends.

332
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:27,394
I know, I know. But here,
check it out. That's the site.

333
00:27:27,562 --> 00:27:30,189
What? What is this?
Hold on, Gramps. It's loading.

334
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:33,275
These are some of my racing
friends. Click here, that's me.

335
00:27:33,443 --> 00:27:35,694
What is that there?
That's how you place a bet.

336
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:39,198
That's me, Gramps. That's what
I do when I'm not working here.

337
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:41,700
- What is that? A race?
- Yeah.

338
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:46,121
- What are you racing for?
- To get us back to the ocean.

339
00:27:46,289 --> 00:27:48,332
- Then win the fucking race.
- I plan to...

340
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:51,126
...but how would Grandma feel
with you talking like that?

341
00:27:51,294 --> 00:27:53,712
She didn't like the word,
but she liked doing it.

342
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:57,091
You couldn't stop her
when she got going.

343
00:27:58,468 --> 00:28:01,136
All right, look, I'm...
Just watch at 3, okay?

344
00:28:01,304 --> 00:28:03,847
I'm gonna sit here
and wait for it to come on.

345
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:06,684
- I gotta go do this.
- Yeah, okay. I'll watch.

346
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:08,851
Think about your grandma.

347
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:24,410
You can let go of my lip now.

348
00:28:24,577 --> 00:28:27,496
I thought you liked my love bites.

349
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:31,959
I love your love bites.
I'm just trying to stay focused.

350
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:37,548
Ryan wins, Ryan wins, Ryan wins.

351
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:41,802
Tell me, do you always
talk to yourself?

352
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:47,182
Uh... Yeah.

353
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:51,186
I'm very good company.

354
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:53,814
I bet.

355
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:55,982
Do you always talk to yourself?

356
00:28:57,026 --> 00:29:00,112
I'm very good company.
I bet.

357
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,739
I bet.

358
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:05,784
Shit! The bet. The bet!

359
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:08,162
Ail right, here we go.
It's the last race of the season.

360
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:10,789
Here we go.
Make it good and memorable.

361
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:12,916
- Miles?
Come on.

362
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:19,965
Okay, freerunners, line them up.

363
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:23,635
Now pay attention, because
I'm only gonna say this once.

364
00:29:23,803 --> 00:29:27,139
It's a three-flag race
with three Locations.

365
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:31,351
The green flag is at the top of
Pantry's Tavern's fire escape.

366
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:34,188
Then you head on through
the Trust Building's alleyways...

367
00:29:34,355 --> 00:29:36,064
...to get to the yellow flag.

368
00:29:36,065 --> 00:29:40,360
And the red flag is at the warehouse
where we were partying last night.

369
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:42,237
But do me a favor, boys.

370
00:29:42,238 --> 00:29:46,200
When you get there, try not
to slip on Kid Elvis' puke, hey?

371
00:29:46,409 --> 00:29:49,161
Now, come on, boys.
Whatever it takes, hey? Come on!

372
00:29:49,829 --> 00:29:53,040
Yesterday was a fluke, asshole.
And you still didn't win.

373
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:56,335
- Only because you tried to kill me.
- No, I was only playing.

374
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:58,503
I'm not.

375
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:02,883
- Jeez, Ryan. You frighten me.
Okay, Dolores, baby. Call it.

376
00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:07,596
On your mark, get set, go!

377
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:48,428
Where's Ryan?
Dead last.

378
00:31:25,341 --> 00:31:29,261
Mitch got the green flag!
Get it! Get it!

379
00:31:32,932 --> 00:31:34,932
Ryan's got it!

380
00:31:38,771 --> 00:31:40,771
Wait up!

381
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:06,506
See, I like this kid,
but he never wins.

382
00:32:06,674 --> 00:32:08,884
Jacque, he'll be there soon.

383
00:32:10,845 --> 00:32:12,845
We're ready here.

384
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:21,146
d I don't wanna be falling down
Too high... d

385
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:23,481
Come on. Come on, baby.

386
00:32:27,695 --> 00:32:29,695
- Look at that.
- Mm-hm.

387
00:32:29,697 --> 00:32:31,697
The kid can run.

388
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,623
They're heading there now.

389
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:53,762
Hold on, no ketchup?

390
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:31,549
Shit, yeah!

391
00:33:32,051 --> 00:33:34,720
There's no way you're leaving
here with all three flags.

392
00:33:34,887 --> 00:33:37,097
Eat a dick, Finch.

393
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:39,265
Why don't we see about that, huh?

394
00:33:40,309 --> 00:33:42,309
Hey.

395
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:46,022
What...?

396
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:49,776
What the...?

397
00:33:49,777 --> 00:33:52,279
What happened? Did he win?

398
00:33:58,578 --> 00:34:00,454
All the doors are locked, man.

399
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:03,915
Check that. I'm taking those flags.

400
00:34:04,083 --> 00:34:06,043
Stop pulling!

401
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:08,670
They're all locked.
Fucking Reese is playing us.

402
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:11,465
What the hell?
Is anybody up there?

403
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:13,425
What the hell is that?
What the fuck?

404
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:14,634
Let us out!

405
00:34:14,635 --> 00:34:16,635
- What is this?
Who's up there?

406
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:19,264
- in the middle of a race.
What the fuck is that?

407
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:21,933
What the hell is that?
You guys see that?

408
00:34:22,101 --> 00:34:23,852
This is some kind of joke, right?

409
00:34:23,853 --> 00:34:25,853
I don't think so.

410
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:58,178
I love watching
all the racers, their stats.

411
00:34:58,346 --> 00:35:00,346
Check out their forms
and techniques.

412
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:03,183
Yeah, you know it's
important to look up races...

413
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:06,436
...old races, checking out
form and technique.

414
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:08,604
But always remember the banker:

415
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:12,692
Past performance does not
guarantee future performance.

416
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:14,486
I'll bet $2 million.

417
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:16,530
you know what they say, old son.

418
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:20,117
Talk is cheap, money buys whiskey.

419
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:22,452
Eight million.

420
00:35:33,714 --> 00:35:35,714
Where am I?

421
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:38,217
- What the fuck?
Shit.

422
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:45,474
Fuck, man.

423
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:53,191
What the fuck?!
Goddamn it.

424
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:57,069
Ryan, where are we?

425
00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:04,786
- What?
What is that?

426
00:36:04,787 --> 00:36:07,289
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

427
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:09,624
My name is Mr. Frank.

428
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:11,501
And for the next 60 minutes...

429
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:15,589
...you are my unwilling participants
in a race for your life.

430
00:36:15,756 --> 00:36:18,758
- Here are the rules...
- Yeah, fuck you!

431
00:36:18,926 --> 00:36:21,928
Back up! You better
let me out right fuck... Aah!

432
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:26,849
Oh, what the fuck
are you doing to him?

433
00:36:28,477 --> 00:36:31,188
Rule number one:
you never interrupt me.

434
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:34,024
Jacque spent 15 years
in a Japanese dojo...

435
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:35,817
...learning that grip.

436
00:36:35,818 --> 00:36:37,944
And he never gets tired of it.

437
00:36:38,779 --> 00:36:40,822
Rule number two:

438
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:43,491
The device around your
neck is set to explode...

439
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:46,453
...in exactly 60 minutes.

440
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:49,497
There's no stopping that now.

441
00:36:49,665 --> 00:36:51,541
If you go to the police...

442
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:53,919
...I will push the manual
detonate button.

443
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:56,796
And then you're no Longer
members of this planet.

444
00:36:57,131 --> 00:37:01,760
Only I have the remote,
only L can release you.

445
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:04,429
So you'd better race as if
your Life depended on it.

446
00:37:04,597 --> 00:37:07,807
And let me assure you gentlemen,
heh...

447
00:37:07,975 --> 00:37:10,518
- ... it does.
- Bullshit.

448
00:37:10,686 --> 00:37:14,189
See, Jacque? I knew we would
need a little demonstration.

449
00:37:14,357 --> 00:37:16,191
What's going on, man?

450
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:18,192
- Let me go!
- What the fuck are you doing?

451
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:21,696
Green means armed.
yellow lights...

452
00:37:21,864 --> 00:37:24,407
No, wait, wait! We'll race!
We'll race! We'll all race!

453
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:26,575
Red Lights.

454
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:32,955
for unlimited celebrity sex videos visit

455
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:35,125
Fucking mental, man.

456
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:37,003
I'm sorry I had to expose you...

457
00:37:37,004 --> 00:37:39,422
...to the grim reality
of your situation.

458
00:37:40,174 --> 00:37:44,261
But there is some good news.
Jacque?

459
00:37:49,058 --> 00:37:51,726
One million dollars to
the freerunner who makes it...

460
00:37:51,894 --> 00:37:56,147
...to the top of the railroad bridge
before 60 minutes has elapsed.

461
00:37:57,316 --> 00:37:59,526
What about second place?

462
00:38:05,658 --> 00:38:07,284
Bring it, dickface.

463
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:09,285
That's the spirit.

464
00:38:09,745 --> 00:38:12,747
I'll let the club's hostess,
Stacey, explain the rest.

465
00:38:12,915 --> 00:38:14,124
Hi, I'm Stacey.

466
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:16,167
Welcome to the club's
death game of the year.

467
00:38:16,335 --> 00:38:20,130
Heda, please leave alone.
Hold all my calls.

468
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:22,924
- I will not be disturbed now.
- No one is to disturb me...

469
00:38:23,092 --> 00:38:26,803
- ... while I'm playing the game.
- Money, money. Lovely money.

470
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:28,555
Come to Daddy.

471
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:30,556
I'm watching the fucking
death game here.

472
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:32,350
All of you shut the fuck up.

473
00:38:32,351 --> 00:38:34,352
Hey, Jersey. We're supposed
to watch alone.

474
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:35,770
I'm alone.

475
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:36,980
This year's host...

476
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:40,817
...the newest and brightest club
member of them all, Mr. Frank.

477
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:42,569
Well, we'll see about that.

478
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:44,904
And his game, Freerunner!

479
00:38:45,072 --> 00:38:48,783
Okay, freerunners, time to race
for your lives. Here's the game.

480
00:38:49,076 --> 00:38:50,869
You will have exactly 60 minutes...

481
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:54,205
...to make it across
to the railroad bridge, or kaboom!

482
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:57,083
Each runner's collar is equipped...

483
00:38:57,084 --> 00:38:59,336
...with built-in video
to capture the action.

484
00:38:59,628 --> 00:39:02,589
- Nice.
- Locked on to their wrists...

485
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:05,800
...a combo GPS timer
and a one-way videophone...

486
00:39:05,968 --> 00:39:08,303
...that Mr. Frank will be
checking in on you with.

487
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:12,515
Along the way, the runners must pass
their neckwear by rooftop scanners.

488
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:16,102
Number one is on top
of the Glazier Building.

489
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:19,856
The second scanner is high atop
the Caxson water tower.

490
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:24,027
And the last scanner is at the
highest point of the railroad bridge.

491
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:26,363
Important:
Whoever is in last place...

492
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:29,157
...has only three seconds
to reach the scanner, or:

493
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:31,492
Kaboom!

494
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:34,829
Stray away from
the chosen GPS route...

495
00:39:34,997 --> 00:39:39,292
...the runners have only five
minutes to get back on course, or:

496
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:41,711
Kaboom!

497
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:44,172
Oh, and don't mess with
Mr. Frank or his collars.

498
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:47,884
As you've just seen, he has
no problem activating his detonator.

499
00:39:48,135 --> 00:39:51,596
That's right, boys, five ways
to die, one way to Live:

500
00:39:51,847 --> 00:39:53,515
Win.

501
00:39:53,516 --> 00:39:54,724
Hold on. No, no.

502
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:57,102
I said 10 million
on Decks to die first...

503
00:39:57,269 --> 00:39:59,687
...10 million on Turk to win.

504
00:39:59,855 --> 00:40:01,855
Everyone got it?

505
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:08,321
Oh, and freerunners...

506
00:40:08,322 --> 00:40:12,242
...take them in, boys, because they're
the last tits most of you will ever see.

507
00:40:12,493 --> 00:40:14,327
And the first.

508
00:40:14,328 --> 00:40:16,328
May the best freerunner win.

509
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:22,669
I'll be calling you
on your wrist devices...

510
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:25,046
...to check in from time to time.

511
00:40:25,214 --> 00:40:27,882
And I'll be watching you
on your collar cameras.

512
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:30,050
As well as every security cam...

513
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:33,680
...traffic cam and satellite cam.

514
00:40:33,889 --> 00:40:36,891
We'll all be watching.
Won't we, gentlemen?

515
00:40:37,059 --> 00:40:39,059
Come on, Kid Elvis!

516
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:41,479
Five. Put 5 million on.

517
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,898
Turk, Turk. Come on, Turkey, baby.

518
00:40:44,066 --> 00:40:46,066
Bring it home to Daddy, baby.

519
00:40:48,195 --> 00:40:50,989
- Yeah.
- Why are you doing this?

520
00:40:51,157 --> 00:40:52,449
Why?

521
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,450
Two million. I'll raise that.
Two.

522
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:58,329
- Because it's fun.
- Oh, this is gonna be fun. Ha-ha-ha.

523
00:40:58,622 --> 00:41:01,875
On your mark, get set...

524
00:41:02,084 --> 00:41:08,256
Release the freerunners!

525
00:41:15,097 --> 00:41:16,931
To get to the first scanner...

526
00:41:16,932 --> 00:41:20,393
...the boys must cross
the top of the pedestrian bridge.

527
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:23,688
Come on, baby! That's it, bitch.
Yeah, baby. Whoo-hoo.

528
00:41:23,856 --> 00:41:25,398
Stomp his stupid body, West.

529
00:41:25,399 --> 00:41:27,650
It's Freebo in fourth place,
Turk in fifth.

530
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:30,445
Ryan has helped Kid Elvis
and has fallen behind.

531
00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:31,863
Freebo dies first.

532
00:41:31,864 --> 00:41:35,033
I can't believe it. They're doing it.
They're running your race.

533
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:38,786
Of course they are.
What did I tell you gentlemen?

534
00:41:38,954 --> 00:41:42,540
You may have been playing your little
hunting games throughout the years...

535
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:45,084
...but my game's gonna
blow you away.

536
00:41:51,258 --> 00:41:53,468
Move! Move! Yeah. All right, now.

537
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:55,595
Now we're talking. Let's go.

538
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:57,096
Bada-bing. Bada-bing.

539
00:41:57,097 --> 00:41:58,890
Here we go, Freebo, baby.
Come on.

540
00:41:58,891 --> 00:42:00,891
Come on, Ryan.
Come on now. You can do it.

541
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:02,310
I have a lot of money on you.

542
00:42:02,311 --> 00:42:05,063
Keep going! Keep going, Ryan!
Don't stop!

543
00:42:13,155 --> 00:42:15,823
We should go to the right, right,
man? Which way do we go?

544
00:42:16,408 --> 00:42:18,408
How about down?

545
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:24,582
Did Finch just kick Decks off
the building? What an asshole.

546
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:26,709
Way to die, Decks!

547
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:29,170
Ugh! Stupid Decks!

548
00:42:29,338 --> 00:42:32,006
I lost a lot of my money!
What did you do?

549
00:42:32,174 --> 00:42:35,426
Dead man Decks.
Pay all side bets now.

550
00:42:36,345 --> 00:42:38,221
An earlier departure for Decks...

551
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:40,932
...than predicted by the odds.

552
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:42,934
It's anyone's game here,
gentlemen.

553
00:42:42,935 --> 00:42:48,106
Finch! You are my man! Ha-ha-ha.

554
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:51,276
Aw, man.
Shit. Decks!

555
00:42:51,443 --> 00:42:53,653
He's dead, man. Come on, let's go.

556
00:42:56,198 --> 00:42:59,242
Guess Decks is a safe bet
the day he's died.

557
00:43:01,954 --> 00:43:03,954
Somebody stop him!
There you go.

558
00:43:03,956 --> 00:43:06,457
Got nothing on you, man.
Come on!

559
00:43:06,625 --> 00:43:09,252
Whoa. Shit!
Why the hell's this guy...?

560
00:43:12,631 --> 00:43:14,631
Come on!
There you go.

561
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:19,387
West, Turk and Freebo
clear the first scanner.

562
00:43:21,724 --> 00:43:23,016
But where's Finch?

563
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:25,017
Where's Finch?
Who cares?

564
00:43:26,228 --> 00:43:28,980
After the first scanner,
West is in the lead.

565
00:43:29,148 --> 00:43:30,648
Pay all side bets now.

566
00:43:30,649 --> 00:43:31,899
Pay all side bets.

567
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:33,401
Hell of a game, Mr. Frank.

568
00:43:33,402 --> 00:43:35,945
Oh, my God,
I just lost my factory.

569
00:43:36,113 --> 00:43:38,823
I told you you shouldn't
have took that bet, Chinaman.

570
00:43:39,074 --> 00:43:40,700
Remember, the last one...

571
00:43:40,701 --> 00:43:42,701
...has only three seconds
to be scanned.

572
00:43:42,786 --> 00:43:45,455
All right, Kid Elvis.
I've got a lot of money on this.

573
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:47,415
Kid! The scanner's over here!

574
00:43:47,416 --> 00:43:49,416
Unh!

575
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:51,460
- Finch, what the fuck?
Kill or be killed.

576
00:43:51,545 --> 00:43:53,046
Come on, Kid Elvis. Come on.

577
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:56,215
Hit him in the face!
Go on, get in there!

578
00:43:57,009 --> 00:43:58,843
Yeah, Finch!

579
00:43:58,844 --> 00:44:00,803
Finch, help, man!

580
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:02,804
My money's on you, Kid.

581
00:44:02,931 --> 00:44:04,931
You want my help? Drop him.

582
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:08,561
Finch scanned himself.
Who will be left? Ryan or Kid Elvis?

583
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:12,273
Come on, Kid Elvis.
Pick yourself up! Come on, Kid.

584
00:44:12,441 --> 00:44:14,734
Uh-oh. Ryan accidentally
just scanned himself.

585
00:44:16,278 --> 00:44:18,278
Mom.

586
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:21,073
Kid!

587
00:44:22,242 --> 00:44:26,245
You couldn't fucking
beat my grandmother!

588
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:30,708
Whoo! Man! That was... Man, that
was Like an exploding watermelon.

589
00:44:30,876 --> 00:44:32,877
Man! Whoo! That was something!

590
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:35,087
Kid Elvis bites the dust.

591
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:39,342
Two scanners to go and we're
already down to five players.

592
00:44:40,803 --> 00:44:42,929
I see you're all broken up, Ryan.

593
00:44:43,097 --> 00:44:45,223
- But keep moving.
- You're a murderer.

594
00:44:45,432 --> 00:44:47,225
I'm a businessman.

595
00:44:47,226 --> 00:44:50,269
I'm gonna find you, and when I do...

596
00:44:50,562 --> 00:44:52,980
Well that's very easy to do, Ryan.

597
00:44:53,315 --> 00:44:56,442
you win the race and I will be there.

598
00:44:56,610 --> 00:44:59,904
And I will hand you $1 million.

599
00:45:00,072 --> 00:45:04,283
And then we can work out
life's little problems when it's over.

600
00:45:05,327 --> 00:45:07,954
When this is over, so are you.

601
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:17,004
Well, you better get
a move on, then.

602
00:45:21,927 --> 00:45:24,971
Because I don't think
you're gonna make it.

603
00:45:27,808 --> 00:45:29,934
Bring it to my desk
when you've filled it out.

604
00:45:30,102 --> 00:45:32,102
All right.

605
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:35,897
Explosions at
Magnolia and 12th Street.

606
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:39,360
Those crazy running guys
we're talking about.

607
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:45,742
One is 6 foot, blue sweatshirt.

608
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:47,952
All suspects heading
towards 7th Street now.

609
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:50,120
7th Street and Magnolia.

610
00:46:08,265 --> 00:46:10,265
Hey, you!

611
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:16,439
Between Main
and Oak. Between Main and Oak St.

612
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:36,751
Freeze!
Freeze!

613
00:46:36,752 --> 00:46:40,546
- Wait, wait. You don't understand.
Get your hands up!

614
00:46:41,048 --> 00:46:43,299
Cover him.

615
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:45,801
Listen, man. There's a guy...

616
00:46:45,886 --> 00:46:48,262
Let me guess.
A criminal mastermind, right?

617
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:49,806
And you got 30 minutes...

618
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:52,475
...to deliver a secret formula
or something. Get in there.

619
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:54,227
Shut the door.
Let's get out of here.

620
00:46:54,228 --> 00:46:57,355
Uh-oh. An unexpected level of
difficulty for the boys.

621
00:46:57,523 --> 00:47:00,691
Unexpected level, my ass. They're
putting those boys in a SWAT van.

622
00:47:00,859 --> 00:47:02,859
I was having so much fun.

623
00:47:02,945 --> 00:47:05,488
Please press the
detonator now, Mr. Frank.

624
00:47:16,291 --> 00:47:19,168
It's gotta be through Reese that
this guy even knows who we are.

625
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:22,129
- That's bullshit, man.
- Well, think about it!

626
00:47:22,339 --> 00:47:25,883
The cameras? The scanners?
They're just like the flags in our race.

627
00:47:26,093 --> 00:47:29,720
This whole last year has been nothing
but a rehearsal for today's main event.

628
00:47:29,888 --> 00:47:32,431
That's twisted.
- So?

629
00:47:33,433 --> 00:47:35,518
So we play.

630
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:38,855
One of us goes and locates Reese...

631
00:47:39,022 --> 00:47:41,399
...we get him to tell us
where to find this guy.

632
00:47:41,608 --> 00:47:44,277
- How do we do that?
- From inside the police truck?

633
00:47:44,486 --> 00:47:46,737
In the next 33 minutes?

634
00:47:46,989 --> 00:47:48,989
What the fuck, Frankie?
Blow them up.

635
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:51,158
- Why blow them up?
- They'll turn us in, Chinaman.

636
00:47:51,326 --> 00:47:53,326
I'm Korean, you dumb fucker.

637
00:47:53,453 --> 00:47:56,372
Mr. Frank, before they turn us in.

638
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:58,540
Press your detonator!

639
00:47:59,376 --> 00:48:04,505
Gentlemen, I have tremendous faith
in the resourcefulness of my players.

640
00:48:09,595 --> 00:48:12,221
GPS countdown started!
We must be out of the green zone.

641
00:48:12,389 --> 00:48:14,974
Fuck this bullshit.
We got Less than 5 minutes!

642
00:48:15,142 --> 00:48:17,142
- it'll blow!
Quit rocking the van!

643
00:48:17,269 --> 00:48:18,978
That's it.

644
00:48:18,979 --> 00:48:20,855
Get up. We're gonna roll this bitch.

645
00:48:20,856 --> 00:48:22,940
- Get up.
That's not gonna work.

646
00:48:23,108 --> 00:48:25,776
One, two, three.

647
00:48:26,612 --> 00:48:28,863
I said cut it out back there!

648
00:48:29,615 --> 00:48:31,615
Shit!
Go!

649
00:48:32,242 --> 00:48:33,701
What are they doing?

650
00:48:33,702 --> 00:48:35,702
- Trying to roil the van!
- Roil it, baby.

651
00:48:35,704 --> 00:48:37,704
I love these fucking guys.

652
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:47,380
Would you look
at these fucking guys?

653
00:48:48,258 --> 00:48:50,301
yes! Keep going, more!

654
00:48:59,561 --> 00:49:01,561
Holy shit!

655
00:49:04,149 --> 00:49:06,149
Ha-ha-ha. Wow.

656
00:49:09,571 --> 00:49:10,780
Holy cow!

657
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:13,616
- You're alive! You're alive!
Yeah, baby!

658
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:16,327
you gotta get back to
this green zone, let's go!

659
00:49:16,495 --> 00:49:19,747
That's my boy!
you're gonna blow up...

660
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:23,000
Green zone, baby! Come on!

661
00:49:27,881 --> 00:49:30,049
Suspects heading
south, towards 6th and Thistle.

662
00:49:30,217 --> 00:49:31,550
Come on, run!
That's it.

663
00:49:31,551 --> 00:49:34,011
- Go, baby! Go!
Chelsea!

664
00:49:34,179 --> 00:49:36,430
Everybody get in the car!
Come on, come on!

665
00:49:36,598 --> 00:49:38,766
We got 40 seconds
to get back to the green zone!

666
00:49:38,934 --> 00:49:40,934
Who's the broad in the car?

667
00:49:41,019 --> 00:49:43,062
- Get to the green zone!
What's going on?

668
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:45,314
Go! Chelsea, stop talking
and just drive!

669
00:49:45,482 --> 00:49:46,732
Come on, let's go!

670
00:49:46,733 --> 00:49:49,151
Drive faster, baby.
You gotta drive faster!

671
00:49:49,319 --> 00:49:51,278
Why is everyone
yelling at me, Ryan?

672
00:49:51,279 --> 00:49:53,114
Just drive!

673
00:49:53,115 --> 00:49:54,657
Just drive, stupid-ass!

674
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:56,951
I'm doing the best that I can!

675
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:59,453
- You are all out of your minds!
We're dead!

676
00:50:00,872 --> 00:50:03,040
What's up with the collars, guys?

677
00:50:03,208 --> 00:50:06,544
If the boys don't make it back into
the green zone within 20 seconds...

678
00:50:06,712 --> 00:50:09,755
...there's going to be one hell of
a mess to clean up in that car.

679
00:50:09,923 --> 00:50:11,674
- I love you.
- What are you doing?

680
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:14,135
I'm sorry, I love you. You gotta go!

681
00:50:14,302 --> 00:50:18,055
What's wrong with...?
Ryan, stop it! Ryan!

682
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:21,016
Stop it!

683
00:50:22,227 --> 00:50:24,227
The boys made it
to the green zone...

684
00:50:24,312 --> 00:50:27,064
...with one second to spare.
What a rush.

685
00:50:27,649 --> 00:50:30,067
Oh, my God. We made it.
We made it!

686
00:50:30,235 --> 00:50:33,237
- We did it! We're alive!
- We made it.

687
00:50:33,447 --> 00:50:36,157
- What the hell is the matter with you?
- I love you, Chelsea!

688
00:50:36,324 --> 00:50:37,950
We love you, Chelsea!

689
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:40,536
You're so amazing.
- And I'm a great driver.

690
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:43,456
- Tell her she's a great driver.
Best driver, Chelsea!

691
00:50:43,623 --> 00:50:45,541
Best driver in the world.

692
00:50:45,542 --> 00:50:48,419
What the hell is going on?

693
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:51,630
And we're back to
the races, gentlemen.

694
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:54,633
Wow, there's over $70 million
in the pot right now.

695
00:50:54,801 --> 00:50:56,302
Let's look at the board.

696
00:50:56,303 --> 00:50:58,804
Best bet to the yellow scanner,
Finch to win at 2-to-1.

697
00:50:58,972 --> 00:51:02,475
Ryan to place at 4-to-1
and West to finish third at 4-to-1.

698
00:51:02,642 --> 00:51:04,977
With odds-on favorites
Freebo and Turk to die.

699
00:51:05,145 --> 00:51:07,772
Place all yellow scanner
side bets now!

700
00:51:07,981 --> 00:51:10,149
Side bet, side bet. I play the...

701
00:51:10,317 --> 00:51:12,651
Buy a half-million shares
of fir Industries... Hold.

702
00:51:12,819 --> 00:51:15,321
Stacey, add 3 million
on Ryan to die here.

703
00:51:15,489 --> 00:51:17,823
I will put my money
where my mouth is.

704
00:51:17,991 --> 00:51:20,576
Stacey, triple ail of my bets
to the yellow scanner.

705
00:51:20,952 --> 00:51:25,289
Finch first, Ryan second,
West third. Turk, dead.

706
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:27,416
I triple all my bets too, Stacey.

707
00:51:27,417 --> 00:51:29,627
- The fuck. I'm in too. Trip it.
- Ryan, Finch...

708
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:33,130
Freebo win, Finch show,
Ryan place, West dead.

709
00:51:33,298 --> 00:51:35,007
Bada Bing, you nuts? Freebo?

710
00:51:35,008 --> 00:51:36,717
What? Pacino, De Niro, Freebo.

711
00:51:36,718 --> 00:51:38,677
Name ends in an O.
He's gotta be good.

712
00:51:38,678 --> 00:51:40,678
Oh, oh, oh. Okay.

713
00:51:41,139 --> 00:51:43,682
I see you're back
on course, freerunners.

714
00:51:43,850 --> 00:51:46,477
I'd be Lying if I said
I wasn't rooting for you.

715
00:51:46,645 --> 00:51:48,104
Of course you are.

716
00:51:48,105 --> 00:51:50,189
What the hell is Rome
without its gladiators?

717
00:51:50,357 --> 00:51:52,108
Who's that?
- No one, Chelsea.

718
00:51:52,109 --> 00:51:54,109
Chelsea?

719
00:51:54,111 --> 00:51:56,570
Ah. Exquisite taste, Ryan.

720
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:58,739
Shut your goddamn mouth!

721
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:01,909
It's quite a show you're giving
us today, boys. It's very good.

722
00:52:02,077 --> 00:52:04,370
Glad we could make this
exciting for you, asshole!

723
00:52:04,538 --> 00:52:08,040
- Yeah. Very exciting, Turk.
Shit.

724
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:09,625
Now, by my clock...

725
00:52:09,626 --> 00:52:13,170
...you have just under 24 minutes
to make the next two scanners.

726
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:15,548
We'll never make it!
Gotta get to Reese's gym!

727
00:52:15,715 --> 00:52:18,384
Get to the yellow flag!
Gotta find Reese. Turn right!

728
00:52:18,552 --> 00:52:20,886
Turn left.
- Go right. We're going to Reese's gym.

729
00:52:21,054 --> 00:52:22,888
Water tower is left.
Take a right.

730
00:52:22,889 --> 00:52:24,557
- Who was that? Which way?
Right!

731
00:52:24,558 --> 00:52:26,183
Left!
- Right!

732
00:52:26,184 --> 00:52:28,561
Goodbye, losers.
Finch, Finch!

733
00:52:28,728 --> 00:52:30,729
Finch! You son of a bitch!

735
00:52:35,652 --> 00:52:37,444
Stop the car! We gotta stop the car!

736
00:52:37,445 --> 00:52:39,155
If he's racing...
Stop the car!

737
00:52:39,156 --> 00:52:40,489
No, we gotta find Reese!

738
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:43,242
He makes it to the last scanner,
that's it, we're dead!

739
00:52:43,952 --> 00:52:47,371
Chelsea. Stop the car.

740
00:52:53,044 --> 00:52:56,046
Come on, West, baby!
Come on! My money's on you!

741
00:52:56,214 --> 00:52:58,757
What's going on? We lost everything.

742
00:52:58,925 --> 00:53:03,220
And I'm sorry, but in 24 minutes,
this thing around my neck explodes.

743
00:53:03,388 --> 00:53:04,597
That'll be everything.

744
00:53:04,598 --> 00:53:07,391
- That's why you tried to throw me out.
- Yes.

745
00:53:09,311 --> 00:53:11,103
What are you doing?

746
00:53:11,104 --> 00:53:13,814
Send this to Miles.
Tell him to run a search of that logo.

747
00:53:13,982 --> 00:53:16,066
The company it belongs to,
CEO, location...

748
00:53:16,234 --> 00:53:18,777
...anything he can find
that relates to this guy.

749
00:53:18,945 --> 00:53:20,487
He calls himself Mr. Frank.

750
00:53:20,488 --> 00:53:22,114
- Where are you going?
- Gotta go!

751
00:53:22,115 --> 00:53:24,325
I gotta get back in the race
or I'm dead!

752
00:53:24,492 --> 00:53:27,244
I'll take you there. Let's go.

753
00:53:34,419 --> 00:53:37,338
Finch's bold move
launches him into first place.

754
00:53:37,505 --> 00:53:39,506
There's West sprinting into second.

755
00:53:39,674 --> 00:53:41,175
Go, go, go!

756
00:53:41,176 --> 00:53:43,510
Come on, Turk. Go, Turk. Go, Turk!

757
00:53:43,678 --> 00:53:46,347
Here we go, Freebo, baby.
Come on, come on. Bada-bing.

758
00:53:46,556 --> 00:53:49,183
- Come on!
Let's go. Come on, baby.

759
00:53:49,351 --> 00:53:52,061
Turk and Freebo are trying
a shortcut through the mall.

760
00:53:52,229 --> 00:53:54,772
Here we go, here we go.
Now we're talking.

761
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:57,191
Come on. Let's go.
Here we go, guys.

762
00:53:57,359 --> 00:53:59,359
Come on, Freebo.

763
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:04,240
Let's go! Let's go!

764
00:54:04,407 --> 00:54:07,660
Where's my man?
Where the bloody hell is my man?

765
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,542
Come on. Come on!

766
00:54:15,543 --> 00:54:17,920
We're back in it,
we're back in it. Come on, Freebo!

767
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:20,714
you're right behind him.
Buddy, let's go!

768
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:23,050
I'll meet you back at my place.
Go, Ryan!

769
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:26,136
Get that camera inside.
I wanna see my guy. There he is.

770
00:54:26,304 --> 00:54:29,098
you're gonna win this.
You have to win, I expect you to win.

771
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:31,266
Hustle, hustle.

772
00:54:36,189 --> 00:54:39,149
Freebo. Your... Your collar.

773
00:54:39,317 --> 00:54:41,360
Get back there. Get back!

774
00:54:41,528 --> 00:54:43,320
What happened to his collar?

775
00:54:43,321 --> 00:54:45,321
He's ticking. He's ticking.

776
00:54:46,241 --> 00:54:48,200
Freebo's collar short-circuits.

777
00:54:48,201 --> 00:54:50,369
- Goodbye, Freebo. We'll miss you.
No!

778
00:54:50,537 --> 00:54:53,122
- Good luck, Turk.
- Freebo!

779
00:54:53,373 --> 00:54:54,957
Oh!

780
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:56,958
You stupid,
orange-sweatshirted...

781
00:54:57,043 --> 00:54:59,920
...goddamn motherfucker!

782
00:55:02,007 --> 00:55:04,258
I'm a banker, Jersey.
Should've listened to me.

783
00:55:04,426 --> 00:55:07,636
Bankers? Always certain,
seldom right.

784
00:55:07,804 --> 00:55:10,014
Add 10 million on round
for yellow scanner.

785
00:55:10,223 --> 00:55:12,558
I reckon your guy's
only got one gear...

786
00:55:13,184 --> 00:55:16,687
...somewhat resembling
an Italian tank:

787
00:55:16,855 --> 00:55:18,855
Reverse.

788
00:55:19,274 --> 00:55:22,693
I'll take Mr. Frank's boy, Finch'll
die here, 14 million. I'm in now.

789
00:55:22,902 --> 00:55:25,446
Fourteen million
against that bet, Jersey.

790
00:55:30,535 --> 00:55:32,036
West, Turk, Finch and Ryan.

791
00:55:32,037 --> 00:55:34,621
For the one that's three
seconds late to the scanner...

792
00:55:34,789 --> 00:55:37,041
...it's sayonara, freerunner.

793
00:55:37,459 --> 00:55:39,335
Turk! Guys, take it easy.

794
00:55:39,336 --> 00:55:41,712
Let's just all stand
and figure out what to do next.

795
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:43,880
I don't trust Finch.

796
00:55:44,215 --> 00:55:47,092
It's a four-runner
showdown. Who will survive?

797
00:55:47,594 --> 00:55:49,136
West takes one in the face.

798
00:55:49,137 --> 00:55:53,015
He'll feel that in the morning,
if he makes it to morning.

799
00:55:54,225 --> 00:55:55,434
Come on!

800
00:55:55,435 --> 00:55:58,395
Gouge his eyes out!
Tear his head off!

801
00:55:58,563 --> 00:56:00,563
Back off.
- Aah!

802
00:56:01,608 --> 00:56:04,234
Ouch. Bye-bye, West.
Three freerunners left.

803
00:56:04,402 --> 00:56:07,654
Go, Turk, baby. Scanner, baby.
Scanner, baby! Get that scan!

804
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:11,658
How could you do this
to me? I believed in you.

805
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:17,790
Ryan's gonna blow.
Come on, come on.

806
00:56:17,957 --> 00:56:19,957
Come on, come on, come on!

807
00:56:22,712 --> 00:56:24,712
- Come on!
Crashed.

808
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:27,590
System failure.
- Yeah!

809
00:56:27,634 --> 00:56:29,843
System failure. System failure.

810
00:56:30,095 --> 00:56:33,013
Wow. Ryan jammed Mr. Frank's
remote and GPS.

811
00:56:33,181 --> 00:56:35,181
How in the world
did he figure that out?

812
00:56:35,183 --> 00:56:37,183
Mr. Frank must be pissed.

813
00:56:42,482 --> 00:56:44,483
I beat your game, bitch.

814
00:56:44,692 --> 00:56:46,692
You disrupted my game.

815
00:56:46,694 --> 00:56:50,531
And I applaud your
ingenuity, I really do.

816
00:56:50,698 --> 00:56:56,245
However, if you don't win
the race in the next 19 minutes...

817
00:56:56,413 --> 00:56:58,122
...L promise you...

818
00:56:58,123 --> 00:57:02,543
...that collar is gonna give you
one splitting headache.

819
00:57:02,710 --> 00:57:04,710
Bullshit.

820
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:08,132
It's quiet out there, isn't it, Ryan?

821
00:57:08,675 --> 00:57:12,636
But if you just listen
to your collar. Just listen.

822
00:57:12,887 --> 00:57:14,887
What does it tell you?

823
00:57:15,014 --> 00:57:17,014
Yes.

824
00:57:17,183 --> 00:57:20,811
That low-level hum that you hear.

825
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:23,230
That is your death march, Ryan.

826
00:57:24,190 --> 00:57:26,400
So you better win the race.

827
00:57:33,825 --> 00:57:35,825
Go fuck yourself.

828
00:57:38,496 --> 00:57:40,496
What the hell just
happened, Mr. Frank?

829
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:42,291
Blow that boy's head up.

830
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:45,085
State-of-the-art technology,
Mr. Frank?

831
00:57:45,253 --> 00:57:48,505
Stacey, what the fuck
just happened?

832
00:57:48,715 --> 00:57:51,842
Ryan's collar update. A slight
engineering flaw has been detected.

833
00:57:52,051 --> 00:57:53,927
No shit, Sherlock.

834
00:57:53,928 --> 00:57:56,847
Mr. Frank's GPS
and detonator have been deactivated.

835
00:57:57,015 --> 00:58:00,267
Mr. Frank can't blow him up.
Ryan can now Leave the green zone.

836
00:58:00,435 --> 00:58:02,269
But his 60-minute countdown...

837
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:06,064
...is still at 19 minutes and his
must-win explosive is still operational.

838
00:58:06,232 --> 00:58:10,068
Put my money
back into my account now!

839
00:58:10,278 --> 00:58:13,197
The race is over.

840
00:58:13,406 --> 00:58:15,282
The race is still on, gentlemen.

841
00:58:15,283 --> 00:58:17,159
Like any good race...

842
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:20,370
...it never quite goes
how you anticipate.

843
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:21,914
All club members...

844
00:58:21,915 --> 00:58:25,083
...you have exactly 60 seconds
to place all bets for the red scanner.

845
00:58:25,251 --> 00:58:28,420
You know what?
Fuck you and fuck your bet!

846
00:58:28,588 --> 00:58:32,674
The kid's collar is broken and
he could turn us all in right now!

847
00:58:33,134 --> 00:58:35,594
Five runners down,
three freerunners left.

848
00:58:35,762 --> 00:58:38,722
Remember, whoever scans first
at the red scanner Lives.

849
00:58:38,890 --> 00:58:41,350
For everyone else: kaboom!

850
00:58:54,906 --> 00:58:58,116
- What do you want?
- Mr. Reese.

851
00:58:58,284 --> 00:59:00,284
Before you fly away
to Never Never Land...

852
00:59:00,328 --> 00:59:04,289
...with a bag of my money,
I have one more mission for you.

853
00:59:04,457 --> 00:59:05,958
The fuck you going on about?

854
00:59:05,959 --> 00:59:08,168
Track down as many
degenerate freerunners...

855
00:59:08,336 --> 00:59:10,963
...from your decrepit
little gym as you can.

856
00:59:11,464 --> 00:59:16,301
And hunt that little fucker
Ryan down.

857
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:19,387
Fucking wanker.

858
00:59:45,582 --> 00:59:47,916
This is for Freebo!

859
00:59:49,669 --> 00:59:51,669
For West.

860
00:59:51,796 --> 00:59:55,090
Aah! And for me!

861
00:59:57,302 --> 00:59:59,302
My man's number one!

862
00:59:59,512 --> 01:00:01,597
Nice, Turk.

863
01:00:02,015 --> 01:00:04,141
The fuck? Run, Turk. Run.

864
01:00:04,350 --> 01:00:07,019
- Freebo didn't deserve this.
- None of us do.

865
01:00:07,186 --> 01:00:09,688
I disabled my collar from
his GPS and his detonator.

866
01:00:09,897 --> 01:00:11,148
What? How?

867
01:00:11,149 --> 01:00:15,485
Shut him up, Mr. Frank.
you think I'm not listening?

868
01:00:15,653 --> 01:00:19,698
You say one more word, Ryan,
and Turk dies right now.

869
01:00:19,949 --> 01:00:22,868
Turk, you win the race...

870
01:00:23,036 --> 01:00:25,036
...you're a free man and a millionaire.

871
01:00:25,246 --> 01:00:26,538
What happens to Ryan?

872
01:00:26,539 --> 01:00:29,166
Ryan. He wants to be a dead man.

873
01:00:29,334 --> 01:00:34,129
You still have a chance,
my friend. You decide now.

874
01:00:39,093 --> 01:00:41,093
Good luck, man.

875
01:00:44,557 --> 01:00:47,142
Oh, Ryan...

876
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:50,103
...where did you meet
such a beautiful girl?

877
01:00:50,271 --> 01:00:54,858
I just... I just can't get
her image out of my head.

878
01:00:55,026 --> 01:00:57,736
- Just keep talking, asshole.
- Oh, I will.

879
01:00:57,904 --> 01:01:00,864
Because I've got years
to talk and talk.

880
01:01:01,032 --> 01:01:04,159
You, my friend,
you have minutes to live.

881
01:01:04,327 --> 01:01:07,496
I'm gonna spend every minute
I got coming after you.

882
01:01:09,165 --> 01:01:12,167
Okay, now listen up.
Put it out there.

883
01:01:12,335 --> 01:01:15,712
At the diner, the gym,
whatever it takes.

884
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:18,423
Tell the boys I'm giving 100 K...

885
01:01:18,591 --> 01:01:20,591
...for the head of Ryan Carter.

886
01:01:20,635 --> 01:01:22,636
Text, send an announcement...

887
01:01:22,804 --> 01:01:25,639
...use a fucking bullhorn
if you have to. I don't give a shit.

888
01:01:25,807 --> 01:01:27,891
Just find him.

889
01:01:28,267 --> 01:01:32,354
Well, tell them to use
a fucking mask. Now, move.

890
01:01:44,367 --> 01:01:46,910
Assassins? What the fuck,
Mr. Frank?

891
01:01:47,453 --> 01:01:49,162
Ryan is my runner!

892
01:01:49,163 --> 01:01:51,498
What the fuck is going on?

893
01:01:52,041 --> 01:01:55,419
Stop that Ryan! Kill that
son of a bitch right now!

894
01:01:55,628 --> 01:01:57,921
Stop that boy!
He's going to the police! Kill him!

895
01:01:58,089 --> 01:02:02,551
You can't kill him. He's
my runner. All my money is on him!

896
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:05,387
No! I just had it waxed!

897
01:02:05,555 --> 01:02:07,723
Get that boy!

898
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:09,641
That kid talks, I'm killing him...

899
01:02:09,642 --> 01:02:13,353
...I'm killing his family and anyone
he's ever talked to in his life!

900
01:02:49,390 --> 01:02:51,767
Oh, my God, he's...
- Out of the green zone.

901
01:02:51,934 --> 01:02:53,685
- Motherfucker!
Ryan is out...

902
01:02:53,686 --> 01:02:57,022
...of the green zone but there's
nothing Mr. Frank can do about it.

903
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:02,778
Now Turk's leaving
the green zone too?

904
01:03:02,945 --> 01:03:05,447
- Fuck you doing, Turk?
- He's losing your bet, asshole.

905
01:03:05,615 --> 01:03:07,574
Turk has left the green zone too.

906
01:03:07,575 --> 01:03:09,575
He has only five minutes
to get back.

907
01:03:19,754 --> 01:03:21,671
Chelsea! Chelsea!

908
01:03:21,672 --> 01:03:23,757
Ryan! Thank God.

909
01:03:26,052 --> 01:03:28,512
- Where's Miles?
- Cyber cafe.

910
01:03:30,223 --> 01:03:32,223
The collar?

911
01:03:32,350 --> 01:03:35,268
We need to go to the cops.
Get a bomb expert. Someone that...

912
01:03:35,436 --> 01:03:39,189
We're fugitives. By the time
they figure it out, it'll be too late.

913
01:03:39,816 --> 01:03:41,817
I don't know. I gotta
find something on him.

914
01:03:41,984 --> 01:03:44,945
Some kind of leverage.
But we gotta go.

915
01:03:45,154 --> 01:03:47,154
- Okay. Okay.
- We gotta go, okay?

916
01:03:57,792 --> 01:03:59,376
Come with me or we tear her apart.

917
01:03:59,377 --> 01:04:01,461
No, don't hurt her!
No, stop! Let her go!

918
01:04:03,130 --> 01:04:06,591
I'm sorry it's gotta be like this.
Come on, you gotta come with me.

919
01:04:06,759 --> 01:04:08,759
Hello, Reese.

920
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:25,443
Turk!
You'd have done it for me!

921
01:04:25,611 --> 01:04:26,945
Turk risks everything...

922
01:04:26,946 --> 01:04:29,990
...by leaving the GPS route
to save his friend Ryan.

923
01:04:30,157 --> 01:04:32,158
- Fucking God!
- What a guy.

924
01:04:32,326 --> 01:04:34,326
A dead guy.

925
01:04:40,084 --> 01:04:43,378
Ryan, don't even think
about it. No way I'm doing this.

926
01:04:43,546 --> 01:04:46,089
No way back.
- But I'm not a freerunner.

927
01:04:46,257 --> 01:04:48,257
You are now.

928
01:04:50,303 --> 01:04:53,346
Oh... Holy shit.

929
01:04:53,514 --> 01:04:55,514
Holy shit.

930
01:05:10,531 --> 01:05:12,741
I've got you now, you little shit!

931
01:05:12,909 --> 01:05:14,910
Chelsea, run!
Aah!

932
01:05:15,077 --> 01:05:18,246
Oh, you wanna play? Let's play.

933
01:05:26,339 --> 01:05:28,465
Officer! Officer!

934
01:05:29,550 --> 01:05:31,801
Officer! Officer!

935
01:05:32,136 --> 01:05:34,136
Offic...

936
01:05:35,848 --> 01:05:37,848
Chelsea, right?

937
01:05:59,205 --> 01:06:01,915
Free-run your way out of this!

938
01:06:04,043 --> 01:06:06,503
I always do, asshole.
- Oh!

939
01:06:06,712 --> 01:06:09,839
- Ryan!
- I got you now, you son of a bitch.

940
01:06:10,007 --> 01:06:12,007
How does it feel? Huh?

941
01:06:12,134 --> 01:06:14,469
- Ryan.
- Who is he?!

942
01:06:15,388 --> 01:06:18,473
Look, they call him Mr. Frank.

943
01:06:18,933 --> 01:06:20,934
He's at the tower.

944
01:06:21,102 --> 01:06:23,478
He's at the tower at the center,
that's all I know.

945
01:06:23,729 --> 01:06:25,563
And the collar, how do I stop it?

946
01:06:25,564 --> 01:06:27,691
How do I fucking stop it?

947
01:06:28,234 --> 01:06:31,695
I don't know.
He's too rich, he's too powerful.

948
01:06:32,530 --> 01:06:36,199
There's always tomorrow, kid.
But not for me. I'm dead anyway.

949
01:06:36,367 --> 01:06:39,244
Don't do it. Reese!

950
01:06:44,792 --> 01:06:48,628
If he can kill that guy,
he can get to your police.

951
01:06:48,838 --> 01:06:53,675
Unbelievable.
Un-be-fucking-believable.

952
01:06:53,843 --> 01:06:55,843
I officially withdraw my bet.

953
01:06:56,012 --> 01:06:58,013
I withdraw my bet as well.

954
01:06:58,180 --> 01:07:00,640
I withdraw Mr. Frank's
club membership.

955
01:07:01,017 --> 01:07:03,768
Membership? I'm gonna
withdraw his fucking heart!

956
01:07:03,978 --> 01:07:05,562
- I second that.
- Third it.

957
01:07:05,563 --> 01:07:07,147
Wait a minute. Mr. Obashi...

958
01:07:07,148 --> 01:07:11,109
- Never mention names, Mr. Frank.
- Yes, yes. Of course.

959
01:07:11,277 --> 01:07:14,279
- This is a fucking scam!
A scam?

960
01:07:14,447 --> 01:07:17,282
Come on. His bet on Finch
is the same exact amount of money...

961
01:07:17,450 --> 01:07:19,868
...that he took from us
to enter this fakakta race.

962
01:07:20,119 --> 01:07:21,786
Do you know what that means?

963
01:07:21,787 --> 01:07:24,956
Fixes the race, takes our money,
gets us thrown in jail. Then "poof"...

964
01:07:25,124 --> 01:07:27,834
...he disappears with the proceeds.
Right, Frankie boy?

965
01:07:28,085 --> 01:07:30,253
If you're fixing this race...

966
01:07:30,463 --> 01:07:32,756
- Just wait, wait a minute!
- ... I will fix you.

967
01:07:32,965 --> 01:07:36,134
You wanted a game. I gave you one.

968
01:07:36,761 --> 01:07:40,555
Better than anything you cretins
could ever come up with.

969
01:07:40,723 --> 01:07:43,975
And now you're nervous,
you're worried. What's the matter?

970
01:07:44,935 --> 01:07:47,353
Too much excitement
for your weak tickers?

971
01:07:47,563 --> 01:07:49,563
Watch yourself, Mr. Frank.

972
01:07:52,026 --> 01:07:54,903
Chelsea. Chelsea. Chelsea!

973
01:07:56,947 --> 01:07:58,782
Shit.

974
01:07:58,783 --> 01:08:00,992
Oh, those guys with the masks again?

975
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:02,952
They ain't gonna do piss.

976
01:08:02,953 --> 01:08:05,246
Total degenerate.

977
01:08:05,414 --> 01:08:07,414
You cunt and a half!

978
01:08:27,103 --> 01:08:29,103
Finch. Finch?

979
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:34,234
- Finch.
- What do you want?

980
01:08:34,443 --> 01:08:36,443
The race is yours to win.

981
01:08:36,612 --> 01:08:40,156
How do I know you're not gonna blow
me up as soon as I win your game?

982
01:08:40,324 --> 01:08:43,952
Because I will fucking
blow you up now if you don't.

983
01:08:54,713 --> 01:08:57,257
- Nice collar.
- Holy shit, dude! What happened?

984
01:08:57,424 --> 01:08:59,843
- Where's Chelsea? She here?
- She's not with you?

985
01:09:00,845 --> 01:09:04,139
- No, she went looking for the cops.
- All right, I'll call her.

986
01:09:04,974 --> 01:09:06,558
What did you find?

987
01:09:06,559 --> 01:09:08,476
The mother lode, dude.

988
01:09:08,477 --> 01:09:09,894
Who is he?

989
01:09:09,895 --> 01:09:12,856
First, that logo belongs to
a company called fir industries.

990
01:09:13,023 --> 01:09:16,985
Its CEO is named Ian F. Ricks.

991
01:09:17,153 --> 01:09:19,112
- "F" for Frank.
- Yeah.

992
01:09:19,113 --> 01:09:21,614
Chelse, it's Miles. Ryan's
here at cyber. Call me back.

993
01:09:21,782 --> 01:09:24,993
Dude, these guys are linked to
top international weapons engineers.

994
01:09:25,161 --> 01:09:27,161
They got a super satellite spy system.

995
01:09:27,163 --> 01:09:29,163
He's a conspiracy theorist's
wet dream.

996
01:09:29,206 --> 01:09:31,206
Tell me he's got an office
at tower center.

997
01:09:31,333 --> 01:09:34,878
Yeah, top floor.
Dude's a block away.

998
01:09:36,297 --> 01:09:38,297
And the collar?

999
01:09:42,845 --> 01:09:44,637
Then I'm dead.

1000
01:09:44,638 --> 01:09:46,638
Smile.

1001
01:09:47,224 --> 01:09:49,350
Why don't you go film yourself?

1002
01:09:49,602 --> 01:09:51,477
Oh, I do, sexy.

1003
01:09:51,478 --> 01:09:54,439
Every night at 8, I turn
this camera right around on me.

1004
01:09:54,607 --> 01:09:58,359
Gothchyck. com. "Chyck" with a Y.

1005
01:09:59,236 --> 01:10:01,236
That's it.

1006
01:10:02,114 --> 01:10:04,866
Gothchyck. com is it?

1007
01:10:05,034 --> 01:10:09,537
Yeah. Can you hack into
this wrist-phone thing?

1008
01:10:09,705 --> 01:10:12,290
Not without accessing
the satellite computer mainframe.

1009
01:10:12,458 --> 01:10:14,458
It's a block away.

1010
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:16,960
Wha...? Wait.
I gotta pack my computer!

1011
01:10:18,297 --> 01:10:20,297
Look at that ass, Jacque.

1012
01:10:27,223 --> 01:10:29,849
- You're the guy...
- I'm the guy from the watch.

1013
01:10:31,101 --> 01:10:33,353
Call me Mr. Frank.

1014
01:10:34,438 --> 01:10:36,314
And you're Chelsea...

1015
01:10:36,315 --> 01:10:40,109
...the one Ryan's willing to
fly through city streets for.

1016
01:10:40,319 --> 01:10:43,863
And I can see why. You're beautiful.

1017
01:10:44,073 --> 01:10:46,115
Where's Ryan?

1018
01:10:46,283 --> 01:10:48,785
I'm afraid he's no longer
with us, sweetheart.

1019
01:10:49,495 --> 01:10:51,496
I don't believe you.

1020
01:10:51,705 --> 01:10:54,332
If you really wanna see the world...

1021
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,043
...you're with the right man now.

1022
01:10:57,711 --> 01:11:02,090
Seeing the world with you
would turn the world into shit!

1023
01:11:03,968 --> 01:11:07,804
Ha, ha, ha.
You got a nasty wit about you.

1024
01:11:08,430 --> 01:11:12,308
It's okay. I really like that.

1025
01:11:15,562 --> 01:11:20,275
Hey, you ever check out
gothchyck. com? it's my website.

1026
01:11:20,442 --> 01:11:22,694
Got my camera on me ail night.

1027
01:11:22,861 --> 01:11:26,197
Or maybe you're just too busy
playing with your radio.

1028
01:11:37,334 --> 01:11:40,586
That's it, man. Mainframe.

1029
01:11:42,881 --> 01:11:45,758
Oh, we turn the cameras
around on them. I get it.

1030
01:11:45,926 --> 01:11:47,927
But dude, it's so locked.
How do we get in?

1031
01:11:48,095 --> 01:11:51,264
We gotta get up to get down.
Come on, let's go.

1032
01:12:16,874 --> 01:12:19,667
Hey, hey. This is it. This is it.

1033
01:12:19,835 --> 01:12:22,253
We're gonna go through on three.

1034
01:12:22,421 --> 01:12:24,421
One, two...

1035
01:12:27,843 --> 01:12:29,677
Security alert.

1036
01:12:29,678 --> 01:12:31,596
Are you sure Ryan's not alive?

1037
01:12:31,597 --> 01:12:33,431
Jacque, get the girl.

1038
01:12:33,432 --> 01:12:38,227
Security alert.
Control room. Door lock initiated.

1039
01:12:38,479 --> 01:12:39,979
Guess counting's not your thing.

1040
01:12:39,980 --> 01:12:41,606
- Get the door!
- Shit.

1041
01:12:41,607 --> 01:12:44,776
Control room. Door lock initiated.

1042
01:12:51,909 --> 01:12:53,909
Oh, shit.

1043
01:13:09,676 --> 01:13:12,345
Ryan! Help!

1044
01:13:17,476 --> 01:13:19,977
Door lock initiated.

1045
01:13:20,396 --> 01:13:23,398
Security alert. Control room.

1046
01:13:23,649 --> 01:13:27,110
My kid's tree house is better secured
than your fucking building.

1047
01:13:27,319 --> 01:13:29,319
You piece of shit!

1048
01:13:29,488 --> 01:13:32,615
Gentlemen, your worry is all part...

1049
01:13:32,783 --> 01:13:35,535
...of the excitement of the game,
part of the playing field.

1050
01:13:35,702 --> 01:13:39,122
- I'm coming for you!
- You absolute piece of rubbish.

1051
01:13:39,373 --> 01:13:41,666
I'm out of here, boys and girls.
Fuck off and die.

1052
01:13:41,917 --> 01:13:46,671
We will see you very, very soon!

1053
01:13:46,839 --> 01:13:50,591
I'm coming. I'm fucking coming!

1054
01:13:50,759 --> 01:13:53,136
- You're dead!
- You're so fucking dead.

1055
01:13:53,512 --> 01:13:55,513
Mr. Frank, is everything okay?

1056
01:13:56,223 --> 01:13:58,891
Security alert.
- How's it coming?

1057
01:13:59,518 --> 01:14:01,144
Thirty seconds.

1058
01:14:01,145 --> 01:14:05,565
We'll be downloading everything off
your wrist and sending it worldwide.

1059
01:14:05,816 --> 01:14:09,652
- All right, who am I sending it to?
- Everyone.

1060
01:14:13,824 --> 01:14:17,285
All right, you're on.

1061
01:14:19,538 --> 01:14:22,415
My name is Ryan Carter.

1062
01:14:22,749 --> 01:14:26,252
Today, a man named
Ian Frank Ricks...

1063
01:14:26,420 --> 01:14:28,420
...killed six innocent men.

1064
01:14:30,132 --> 01:14:32,633
Mom.
- Kid!

1065
01:14:35,220 --> 01:14:36,721
No!

1066
01:14:36,722 --> 01:14:38,723
Shit.
- Holy shit.

1067
01:14:40,559 --> 01:14:42,018
They were my friends.

1068
01:14:42,019 --> 01:14:44,019
Are you tracking this?
I'm on it.

1069
01:14:44,021 --> 01:14:46,606
He killed them for the sake
of a multimillion-dollar...

1070
01:14:46,773 --> 01:14:48,773
...gambling ring run by the sick...

1071
01:14:48,775 --> 01:14:51,319
...twisted individual billionaires
you see here.

1072
01:14:51,487 --> 01:14:55,198
- Shit.
- Shit.

1073
01:14:55,908 --> 01:14:57,908
I hate billionaires.

1074
01:14:59,411 --> 01:15:01,913
I'm here to tell them all:

1075
01:15:02,414 --> 01:15:04,414
Game over.

1076
01:15:07,211 --> 01:15:09,962
- Way to go, guys.
- Mr. Frank, if I were you...

1077
01:15:11,215 --> 01:15:13,382
...I'd start running.

1078
01:15:19,389 --> 01:15:22,934
- Did we get through?
- I think we did.

1079
01:15:23,143 --> 01:15:25,811
Door locks disabled in 60 seconds.

1080
01:15:28,065 --> 01:15:30,525
it's Chelsea!
Give it to me.

1081
01:15:30,943 --> 01:15:32,360
Say hello, Chelsea.

1082
01:15:32,361 --> 01:15:34,320
Chelsea.
No.

1083
01:15:34,321 --> 01:15:36,781
Now say goodbye, Chelsea.

1084
01:15:37,491 --> 01:15:41,202
Hello, Ryan. Can you see me?

1085
01:15:41,370 --> 01:15:44,789
I've never used this phone before.
I don't quite know where to hold it.

1086
01:15:44,998 --> 01:15:46,666
Where is she?

1087
01:15:46,667 --> 01:15:49,418
Sadly, you've got
about five minutes to Live.

1088
01:15:49,586 --> 01:15:51,546
Where is she?!

1089
01:15:51,547 --> 01:15:54,799
And since I've been forced
to do some immediate traveling...

1090
01:15:55,175 --> 01:15:58,177
...regrettably, I won't be able to
say goodbye in person.

1091
01:15:58,845 --> 01:16:00,845
But Lucky me.

1092
01:16:00,931 --> 01:16:05,226
I found myself a lovely
traveling companion.

1093
01:16:05,561 --> 01:16:07,228
Chelsea.

1094
01:16:07,229 --> 01:16:12,733
Goodbye, Ryan.
Oh, and by the way, good game.

1095
01:16:15,320 --> 01:16:17,320
No!

1096
01:16:17,614 --> 01:16:19,614
Family plan.

1097
01:16:19,658 --> 01:16:21,658
GPS. Come on, come on.
come on.

1098
01:16:21,743 --> 01:16:24,161
There they are!
We get GPS on the family plan.

1099
01:16:24,329 --> 01:16:27,331
They're going to the bridge.
To the last scanner! Go, Ryan.

1100
01:16:27,499 --> 01:16:28,791
Door locks now disabled.

1101
01:16:28,792 --> 01:16:30,293
Go, go, go!

1102
01:16:30,294 --> 01:16:32,169
- You wanna go? Come on.
You take him.

1103
01:16:32,170 --> 01:16:34,170
- I'll go after the other one.
Ow.

1104
01:16:35,632 --> 01:16:38,759
Stop! Hey! Get back here!

1105
01:16:41,555 --> 01:16:43,556
Hey, hey, hey! Stop!

1106
01:16:47,227 --> 01:16:49,227
Hey.

1107
01:16:55,694 --> 01:16:58,279
It's got a busted headlight,
but this baby really cooks.

1108
01:16:58,447 --> 01:17:00,323
Sorry. it's an emergency.
Hey, hey!

1109
01:17:00,324 --> 01:17:03,159
Get off my bike. That's my bike!
Get off my...

1110
01:18:12,354 --> 01:18:14,354
Been waiting for you, asshole.

1111
01:18:15,190 --> 01:18:17,858
At this scanner, second place
is a dead man!

1112
01:18:26,284 --> 01:18:29,745
Finch! Are you crazy?
They're gonna kill you anyway!

1113
01:18:38,046 --> 01:18:40,840
It's not about the collar,
it's not about dickface!

1114
01:18:41,299 --> 01:18:44,260
- This is between me and you!
it's not a race, man!

1115
01:19:10,328 --> 01:19:12,455
I'll always be the winner, Ryan!

1116
01:19:13,290 --> 01:19:16,917
Mr. Frank! I'm not
playing your game anymore.

1117
01:19:17,127 --> 01:19:19,127
You're the fucking loser!

1118
01:19:20,338 --> 01:19:23,048
- I quit!
- You fucking idiot.

1119
01:19:24,676 --> 01:19:26,676
Oh, for fuck's sake!

1120
01:19:43,987 --> 01:19:46,197
We'll be in City Island soon.

1121
01:19:46,364 --> 01:19:49,700
And, my truffle, we'll take
you wherever you wanna go.

1122
01:19:49,910 --> 01:19:51,910
You'll have to kill me first.

1123
01:19:52,162 --> 01:19:53,913
Oh.

1124
01:19:53,914 --> 01:19:56,165
Oh, okay.

1125
01:20:04,049 --> 01:20:06,049
Ah...

1126
01:20:06,676 --> 01:20:09,512
God, I love that face.

1127
01:20:32,077 --> 01:20:35,371
Hey, what are they serving
on the flight this evening?

1128
01:20:35,580 --> 01:20:37,373
Pork loin, sir.

1129
01:20:37,374 --> 01:20:39,959
- Pork loin... Fuck, what are you...?
Ah!

1130
01:20:40,126 --> 01:20:43,128
Bitch. What are you,
fucking stupid? Eh?

1131
01:20:43,296 --> 01:20:48,217
Fucking move over there.
Do you wanna get fucking shot?

1132
01:20:57,686 --> 01:20:59,686
Ryan!

1133
01:21:01,106 --> 01:21:04,817
You stay there. Stay there.

1134
01:21:10,740 --> 01:21:12,740
No! No!

1135
01:21:14,995 --> 01:21:16,995
Come here.

1136
01:21:18,915 --> 01:21:21,166
Hold it, Ryan. Hold on.

1137
01:21:21,334 --> 01:21:23,419
Recognize the collar
she's wearing, yeah?

1138
01:21:23,587 --> 01:21:25,713
Now look at your timer.

1139
01:21:26,131 --> 01:21:28,132
You got about 30 seconds
to live.

1140
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:31,760
And so does she unless you
do exactly as I say.

1141
01:21:31,928 --> 01:21:35,681
- What is it?
- A deal so you don't blow us all up.

1142
01:21:35,849 --> 01:21:37,975
In this briefcase there's $1 million.

1143
01:21:38,143 --> 01:21:40,728
Now, I'm a man of my word.

1144
01:21:40,896 --> 01:21:44,106
You jump off the boat,
I'll release the collar.

1145
01:21:44,274 --> 01:21:47,776
You keep the money,
I'll keep the girl.

1146
01:21:49,237 --> 01:21:51,989
You got about 20 seconds.

1147
01:21:52,324 --> 01:21:54,366
Eighteen, 17...

1148
01:21:54,534 --> 01:21:56,327
- I'll do it!
- Ryan!

1149
01:21:56,328 --> 01:21:58,662
Good boy. Ha-ha-ha.

1150
01:21:58,872 --> 01:22:00,956
Good decision for both of you.

1151
01:22:01,124 --> 01:22:03,124
Ryan, no.

1152
01:22:03,501 --> 01:22:06,170
- Love bites, doesn't it?
- it sure does.

1153
01:22:06,630 --> 01:22:09,632
Aah! Fuck!

1154
01:22:17,474 --> 01:22:19,474
Enjoy the headache, asshole!

1155
01:22:40,330 --> 01:22:43,415
Decks, Freebo...

1156
01:22:43,583 --> 01:22:46,210
...Mitch, West...

1157
01:22:46,378 --> 01:22:50,506
...Finch, Turk, Kid Elvis.

1158
01:22:50,674 --> 01:22:53,717
They were my friends.
They were freerunners.

1159
01:22:53,885 --> 01:22:56,804
And if they don't allow
free-running in heaven, well...

1160
01:22:56,972 --> 01:22:59,431
...these guys will find a way.

1161
01:23:00,892 --> 01:23:02,892
As for me and Chelsea...

1162
01:23:03,019 --> 01:23:07,773
...we couldn't believe there was a
million bucks in Mr. Frank's briefcase.

1163
01:23:07,941 --> 01:23:09,942
Got Gramps back to the ocean.

1164
01:23:10,110 --> 01:23:12,403
Still cranky,
but you gotta Love the guy.

1165
01:23:12,570 --> 01:23:16,865
As for Chelse, she just keeps
getting more and more beautiful.

1166
01:23:17,450 --> 01:23:20,452
Me? I'm good.

1167
01:23:20,620 --> 01:23:24,206
I'm just trying to figure out
how a guy free-runs out here.

1168
01:23:43,101 --> 01:23:46,687
Um... A warm welcome
for our unexpected guests...

1169
01:23:46,855 --> 01:23:48,480
...the Metro Police Department!

1170
01:23:48,481 --> 01:23:50,315
Let's go, honey.
Hands off.

1171
01:23:50,316 --> 01:23:51,859
We're going downtown.

1172
01:23:51,860 --> 01:23:53,485
Hey, hey! Watch the stick, buddy!

1173
01:23:53,486 --> 01:23:54,695
Let's go.

1174
01:23:54,696 --> 01:23:57,740
Fuck off! Fuck off!
Take this downtown.

1175
01:24:10,962 --> 01:24:12,796
Just put the laptop there.

1176
01:24:12,797 --> 01:24:16,300
Terence, which one of your private
islands are you currently residing at?

1177
01:24:16,468 --> 01:24:18,552
- What month is it?
- January.

1178
01:24:18,803 --> 01:24:20,679
Then the January island.

1179
01:24:20,680 --> 01:24:24,433
Twelve private islands,
one for each month of the year.

1180
01:24:24,642 --> 01:24:26,642
Don't you get lonely?

1181
01:24:31,816 --> 01:24:33,816
Not really.
