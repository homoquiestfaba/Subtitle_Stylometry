1
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:16,601
Cut! No, no.
That's... No.

2
00:00:16,837 --> 00:00:18,337
You're already dead.

3
00:00:18,338 --> 00:00:20,431
- Yeah, but I thought...
- Dead people don't do that.

4
00:00:20,673 --> 00:00:23,938
...it would be better to show
the last struggle for life.

5
00:00:24,176 --> 00:00:26,770
We're running out of time here.
We really gotta get this.

6
00:00:27,814 --> 00:00:29,372
I'm ready. I'm ready.

7
00:00:30,016 --> 00:00:31,847
Action.

8
00:00:33,954 --> 00:00:36,148
Oh, fuck!

9
00:00:36,388 --> 00:00:38,822
- Something bit me!
- The CGI disk...

10
00:00:41,696 --> 00:00:44,290
<i>Hi, this is Ellie Parker. You...</i>

11
00:00:47,202 --> 00:00:49,101
<i>Hello, this is Ellie.
Leave a message...</i>

12
00:00:49,337 --> 00:00:50,929
<i>and I'll get back to you

13
00:00:51,639 --> 00:00:53,436
<i>Have a great day.</i>

14
00:01:00,716 --> 00:01:02,580
<i>This is Ellie Parker.
This is Ellie Parker.</i>

15
00:01:05,686 --> 00:01:07,620
<i>Leave a message for Ellie.</i>

16
00:01:08,589 --> 00:01:10,750
<i>Hello, this is Ellie Parker.</i>

17
00:01:12,126 --> 00:01:14,617
<i>Leave a message for Ellie, please.</i>

18
00:01:14,862 --> 00:01:17,056
<i>Have a great day.
Good luck.</i>

19
00:01:27,175 --> 00:01:29,166
<i>Hello, this is Ellie Parker.</i>

20
00:01:32,779 --> 00:01:34,542
Okay.

21
00:01:36,149 --> 00:01:40,554
<i>This is Ellie. I'd like you to leave
your name and your number...</i>

22
00:01:40,789 --> 00:01:45,088
<i>and a short message. I'll call you
back as soon as I get in. Thank you.</i>

23
00:01:45,326 --> 00:01:48,124
<i>Hello, hi.
Hi, this is Ellie.</i>

24
00:01:48,696 --> 00:01:51,929
<i>Hi, this is Ellie Parker.
I'll call you right back.</i>

25
00:01:52,869 --> 00:01:54,769
<i>This is Parker.</i>

26
00:01:55,004 --> 00:01:58,336
<i>Hello, this is Ellie Parker.
Leave a message...</i>

27
00:01:59,875 --> 00:02:01,604
<i>and your number.
Oh, my God.</i>

28
00:02:04,446 --> 00:02:05,946
Okay, go ahead.

29
00:02:17,158 --> 00:02:18,492
Ellie.

30
00:02:18,493 --> 00:02:21,189
- Hi!
- Hi. Come up.

31
00:02:22,097 --> 00:02:23,597
- Hello.
- Hi. Nice to see you.

32
00:02:23,799 --> 00:02:25,298
- Nice to see you.
- Are you ready?

33
00:02:25,533 --> 00:02:28,127
Yeah. I mean, yes.

34
00:02:29,103 --> 00:02:30,603
Just give me one second.

35
00:02:35,712 --> 00:02:37,646
- Okay. Ready?
- Okay.

36
00:02:39,114 --> 00:02:41,207
- Everyone, this is Ellie Parker.
- Hi.

37
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:42,950
This is Rick Saul, the producer.

38
00:02:43,652 --> 00:02:47,419
Eslie Town, the writer.
And Smash, our director.

39
00:02:47,657 --> 00:02:51,184
- I loved the script.
- Thank you. Very nice to meet you.

40
00:02:51,427 --> 00:02:53,155
Very nice to meet you.

41
00:02:58,134 --> 00:03:00,762
- So, get it started. Should we try?
- Sure.

42
00:03:03,339 --> 00:03:07,866
We are only now doing the monologue,
not the first and second scenes.

43
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:10,111
Oh, okay.

44
00:03:10,112 --> 00:03:16,018
So, you just lost your mom
and you're cursing God.

45
00:03:17,854 --> 00:03:19,354
Do you have any questions?

46
00:03:19,421 --> 00:03:23,653
No, I'm okay.
Do you have any answers?

47
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:30,990
Just really take this time
to put yourself in this place.

48
00:03:32,269 --> 00:03:37,137
The air is humid.
There's black bugs in the tree.

49
00:03:38,374 --> 00:03:39,932
The... What?

50
00:03:40,177 --> 00:03:43,305
- Ocusts?
- Ocusts, chopping the...

51
00:03:44,114 --> 00:03:49,779
You may be in front of the
old plantation house. It's...

52
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:00,389
I used to think about you
when he hurt me.

53
00:04:01,097 --> 00:04:04,726
You weren't there.
You never were.

54
00:04:06,969 --> 00:04:09,734
Things were so different then.

55
00:04:10,874 --> 00:04:13,308
The bayou was open...

56
00:04:14,944 --> 00:04:16,912
so free.

57
00:04:18,281 --> 00:04:24,518
Sitting on that front porch I looked
into your eyes and stared for hours.

58
00:04:24,756 --> 00:04:26,553
Et me just stop you for a sec.

59
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:32,092
You must remember I'm
taping this on digital video.

60
00:04:32,329 --> 00:04:36,528
So it's very important
that you think very raw.

61
00:04:36,768 --> 00:04:38,463
It's...

62
00:04:39,437 --> 00:04:43,839
Just start again and think that
your acting must be very raw...

63
00:04:44,074 --> 00:04:46,201
very...

64
00:04:47,644 --> 00:04:50,010
Got it.

65
00:05:06,698 --> 00:05:11,066
You weren't there.
You never were.

66
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:16,064
Things were so different then.

67
00:05:17,343 --> 00:05:19,709
The bayou was open...

68
00:05:19,945 --> 00:05:22,209
so free.

69
00:05:24,315 --> 00:05:28,684
Sitting on that front porch,
I stared into your eyes for hours.

70
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:34,123
That terrible night...

71
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:38,295
when the storm ripped and
screamed through everything.

72
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:47,465
The abuse, the denial,
the redemption!

73
00:05:48,773 --> 00:05:51,138
We shared it all.

74
00:05:52,242 --> 00:05:54,437
You were my rock...

75
00:05:56,046 --> 00:05:58,311
my salvation.

76
00:06:01,586 --> 00:06:06,614
You... were me.

77
00:06:11,062 --> 00:06:14,397
And now you're dead, you bitch!

78
00:06:17,804 --> 00:06:22,103
I don't know
if it's possible to go on.

79
00:06:25,779 --> 00:06:31,081
I do not will to stand!
Oh, God, damn you to hell!

80
00:06:31,318 --> 00:06:33,478
Why? Why? Why?

81
00:06:42,261 --> 00:06:45,753
Wow! That was wonderful.

82
00:06:45,997 --> 00:06:48,465
Very good, excellent.
Very good.

83
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:53,661
Are you sure? I can try another way.
I mean, this is such a...

84
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,798
How tall are you?

85
00:06:56,041 --> 00:07:00,409
I'm 5'7. This tall.

86
00:07:00,745 --> 00:07:02,713
How tall is Mel?

87
00:07:02,947 --> 00:07:05,415
About this height.

88
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:08,280
He wears his lifts in his shoes,
so no one will know.

89
00:07:11,025 --> 00:07:14,221
All right, Ellie. That was great.
Thanks for coming.

90
00:07:14,461 --> 00:07:16,656
Okay, thank you. It was nice
to meet you all.

91
00:07:16,897 --> 00:07:20,629
- Thank you.
- I loved the script. It's great.

92
00:07:21,068 --> 00:07:22,695
My keys.

93
00:07:23,504 --> 00:07:25,004
- Bye.
- Bye.

94
00:07:25,206 --> 00:07:28,800
- Was that okay?
- It was great. It was really great.

95
00:07:28,942 --> 00:07:30,739
I kind of wanted to do
those other scenes.

96
00:07:30,977 --> 00:07:33,673
No, that was everything.
It was totally fine.

97
00:07:33,914 --> 00:07:36,849
- They're really nice.
- Oh, yeah, they're great.

98
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:38,641
- The director. What was his name?
- Smash.

99
00:07:38,885 --> 00:07:41,614
Cool. He seems interesting.

100
00:07:41,854 --> 00:07:44,322
Well, you'll be hearing from us.
You know, we'll be in touch.

101
00:07:44,557 --> 00:07:47,925
- Thanks for coming.
- Thanks. Great to see you again.

102
00:07:48,161 --> 00:07:50,129
- All right.
- All right, see you later.

103
00:08:02,143 --> 00:08:05,635
"Sitting on that front porch,
I stared in your eyes..."

104
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,184
et me in, fuckers!

105
00:08:21,296 --> 00:08:24,389
<i>Won't you mistrust
Love's gone behind</i>

106
00:08:27,468 --> 00:08:30,096
<i>In between</i>

107
00:08:39,879 --> 00:08:41,506
Oh, fuck!

108
00:08:49,156 --> 00:08:53,489
I sucked your cock! I sucked
Vinnie's cock! I sucked them all!

109
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,825
I fucked your cock, I sucked it.

110
00:08:57,399 --> 00:08:59,890
I was there.
I was there.

111
00:09:00,168 --> 00:09:06,106
It went okay? So what about
yesterday, did you get feedback?

112
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:10,372
Fucking tell them that I didn't
fucking respond to them either!

113
00:09:10,612 --> 00:09:12,112
That fucking dick wad!

114
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,077
Hold on, can you?
Dennis, hold on.

115
00:09:14,816 --> 00:09:17,649
Hello. Hi, honey. Where are you?

116
00:09:17,886 --> 00:09:21,617
Baby, I'm just in the car,
driving, on the freeway.

117
00:09:21,857 --> 00:09:23,688
I'm late to my second appointment.

118
00:09:23,925 --> 00:09:27,156
"The Cruel City". Fuck it,
I don't know what it's called.

119
00:09:27,362 --> 00:09:29,057
It's a piece of shit anyway.

120
00:09:29,297 --> 00:09:30,797
But it's a good part.

121
00:09:31,132 --> 00:09:34,898
Dennis, hi.
Dennis, sorry, I completely forgot.

122
00:09:35,136 --> 00:09:38,971
Maybe you could call and say
I'm gonna be 5 minutes late.

123
00:09:39,207 --> 00:09:42,699
Isten, you know when they said
they didn't respond to me...

124
00:09:42,944 --> 00:09:45,036
was that my look, was that...

125
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:48,942
what, performance?

126
00:09:49,216 --> 00:09:52,210
All right, I'll call you after,
okay? All right, bye.

127
00:09:52,455 --> 00:09:55,424
I just gotta be some junkie
fucking whore, like New York.

128
00:09:55,658 --> 00:09:58,785
I sucked his cock, Vinnie's cock!
I sucked them all!

129
00:09:59,027 --> 00:10:03,327
Does that accent sound all right?
I'm not good at the Brooklyn thing...

130
00:10:03,565 --> 00:10:06,865
but I did this Southern belle thing
and I fucking nailed it. I was...

131
00:10:07,103 --> 00:10:13,041
Don't make me tell you what I've
just been through, okay? 'Cause I...

132
00:10:13,275 --> 00:10:15,903
Vinnie had blood
all over his fucking shirt!

133
00:10:16,144 --> 00:10:21,708
Don't make me tell you... Don't make
me tell you what I've been through.

134
00:10:22,485 --> 00:10:24,043
Fuck!

135
00:10:24,287 --> 00:10:27,050
Don't make me tell you
what I've just been through.

136
00:10:27,856 --> 00:10:30,484
Vinnie had blood
all over his fucking shirt!

137
00:10:30,726 --> 00:10:34,322
No... Don't make me tell you
what I've just been through, okay?

138
00:10:34,564 --> 00:10:37,829
'Cause Vinnie had blood
all over his fucking shirt!

139
00:10:39,135 --> 00:10:41,227
Baby, I...

140
00:10:41,937 --> 00:10:46,237
You said this before. We've gone
through this. We've gone through it.

141
00:10:46,777 --> 00:10:51,214
What am I supposed to do?
Do you want me to pull over...

142
00:10:51,448 --> 00:10:53,972
and just park and listen to you,
what you have to say...

143
00:10:54,217 --> 00:10:58,483
while I'm on my way to a fucking
audition trying to earn some money?

144
00:10:59,322 --> 00:11:04,522
I know. What do you expect me to do?
How can I not get emotional when...

145
00:11:05,696 --> 00:11:09,153
Don't hang up on me! Don't!

146
00:11:09,932 --> 00:11:12,093
Motherfucker!

147
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:20,505
Vinnie, I sucked your cock.

148
00:11:20,777 --> 00:11:22,801
He had blood all over
his fucking shirt!

149
00:11:23,044 --> 00:11:26,879
You try going from Avenue A to
Belford Stiverson in 10 minutes.

150
00:11:27,116 --> 00:11:29,017
You try. You try it.

151
00:11:36,893 --> 00:11:39,361
I sucked his cock.
I sucked his cock.

152
00:11:54,144 --> 00:11:56,272
He had blood
all over his fucking shirt!

153
00:12:22,004 --> 00:12:24,030
I sucked his cock. I sucked it good.

154
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:28,675
Fuck!

155
00:12:44,128 --> 00:12:47,757
- Hi.
- Hi, how are you doing? Sign in.

156
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:50,434
- Great.
- Can I get you some water or coffee?

157
00:12:50,669 --> 00:12:53,229
If I have any coffee,
my head will explode.

158
00:12:53,472 --> 00:12:55,099
Water's fine. Thanks.

159
00:12:55,341 --> 00:12:59,572
Have a seat over here.
I'll get this mess.

160
00:12:59,978 --> 00:13:03,414
- Joann will be right with you.
- Thanks a lot.

161
00:13:20,064 --> 00:13:21,564
- Hi.
- Hi!

162
00:13:21,599 --> 00:13:23,000
You look lovely.

163
00:13:23,001 --> 00:13:24,696
- Thanks.
- Good to see you.

164
00:13:25,302 --> 00:13:29,739
I won't kiss you cause I've got a
cold, I don't want you to catch it.

165
00:13:29,973 --> 00:13:33,502
The director is in Vancouver, we're
going to put you on tape. That okay?

166
00:13:33,747 --> 00:13:35,247
All right. Okay.

167
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:40,684
So you can just take a sit here.
And we'll tape you.

168
00:13:40,953 --> 00:13:44,013
- Okay. So I'm reading with you?
- Yes.

169
00:13:44,256 --> 00:13:46,623
- You get a chance to read the script?
- Yes, I did.

170
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:50,990
Can we...? Sorry, that light is
really bright. Can we...? Thanks.

171
00:13:52,132 --> 00:13:53,631
- How's that?
- That's great.

172
00:13:53,632 --> 00:13:55,793
Et's see what happens here.

173
00:13:56,035 --> 00:13:57,535
I'm just getting my hair a little...

174
00:13:57,803 --> 00:13:59,303
Do you have any questions?

175
00:13:59,438 --> 00:14:03,204
No, I just... Does she love him
or she sort of...

176
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:06,033
I would say it's very much
a love-hate relationship.

177
00:14:06,277 --> 00:14:09,110
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.
I just wasn't like... sure.

178
00:14:09,347 --> 00:14:12,248
I did this like weird hair
and make-up...

179
00:14:12,483 --> 00:14:15,476
It looks great.
No, I really like it.

180
00:14:15,854 --> 00:14:17,685
A junkie whore.

181
00:14:17,923 --> 00:14:20,755
I should be talking in my American
accent, my New Yorker accent.

182
00:14:21,092 --> 00:14:24,186
- Not right now. Once we go on tape.
- Okay.

183
00:14:24,429 --> 00:14:28,128
- So, ready?
- Yeah. Is it okay if I stand?

184
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:31,997
Absolutely, I mean...
Trixie can move around and...

185
00:14:32,238 --> 00:14:35,434
You do what you want.
Don't worry about it

186
00:14:35,874 --> 00:14:38,036
You should stand up with her.
Trixie?

187
00:14:38,278 --> 00:14:40,907
- I'm almost ready. Here we go.
- Ens cap.

188
00:14:41,148 --> 00:14:43,173
Oh, right, here we go.

189
00:14:43,417 --> 00:14:45,783
Ellie Parker.

190
00:14:46,687 --> 00:14:50,850
Okay. I'm ready.

191
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:56,055
- Goddamn it, you were late!
- There wasn't time!

192
00:14:56,396 --> 00:15:00,423
You try getting from Avenue A to
Belford Stiverson in 10 minutes!

193
00:15:00,967 --> 00:15:03,161
You make time.

194
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:06,633
Don't make me tell you what
I've just been through, okay?

195
00:15:06,872 --> 00:15:09,933
'Cause Vinnie came home with
blood all over his fucking shirt!

196
00:15:12,479 --> 00:15:17,177
Don't care if there's blood coming out
of your twat. You fucking be there.

197
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:18,916
I was there!

198
00:15:18,984 --> 00:15:24,185
I sucked his cock, Vinnie's cock,
I sucked your fucking flacid cock!

199
00:15:26,193 --> 00:15:30,185
You were doped up beyond belief,
do you remember?

200
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:36,866
You know the arrangement, you were
late. We're having dinner at uigi's.

201
00:15:39,774 --> 00:15:41,504
I ain't hungry.

202
00:15:42,244 --> 00:15:45,269
You wouldn't be, you junkie whore.

203
00:15:49,216 --> 00:15:51,446
- That was lovely.
- Are you sure?

204
00:15:51,685 --> 00:15:53,983
We could try it another way,
I mean...

205
00:15:54,355 --> 00:15:57,881
Not for me. Unless you want to.
It was perfect.

206
00:15:58,124 --> 00:15:59,624
In my point of view,
you just nailed it.

207
00:15:59,826 --> 00:16:03,661
Really? Okay. Excellent.
All right, good.

208
00:16:04,231 --> 00:16:08,167
- So, it was nice to see you.
- Well, it was great to see you.

209
00:16:08,536 --> 00:16:12,437
It'd be great to meet the director,
if you think... I love the script.

210
00:16:12,672 --> 00:16:13,872
- You wrote it, right?
- Yeah.

211
00:16:13,873 --> 00:16:17,834
Yeah, it's good.
Okay, all right.

212
00:16:18,113 --> 00:16:22,243
That's it for another day.
Okay, have fun.

213
00:16:22,484 --> 00:16:24,542
- You too.
- Bye.

214
00:16:24,785 --> 00:16:29,017
- We'll get back to you the weekend.
- Okay. I'd love to meet the director.

215
00:16:29,256 --> 00:16:31,418
I know. He's really sorry
he couldn't be here.

216
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:35,391
All right, see you later. Bye.

217
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:56,739
Sir, I think it's obviously
quite deliberate.

218
00:16:56,984 --> 00:16:59,453
It was the intention of the artist.

219
00:17:00,188 --> 00:17:02,622
The show is called
"Peripheral Perspectives".

220
00:17:03,058 --> 00:17:05,753
It's supposed to be out of focus.

221
00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:12,762
How could've it gone out of focus
once you got it home?

222
00:17:14,704 --> 00:17:18,764
Would you mind just holding for me
for a minute, please? Dumb fuck!

223
00:17:19,941 --> 00:17:23,104
Oh, darling. Bad day?

224
00:17:24,646 --> 00:17:29,414
Ook at you.
Come here.

225
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:38,286
You're going to be fired if you keep
calling people "stupid fucks".

226
00:17:38,727 --> 00:17:42,959
I hope I get fired so I can just
dedicate myself to my acting.

227
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,294
What's going on?

228
00:18:15,398 --> 00:18:18,128
I don't know who I am.

229
00:18:21,972 --> 00:18:27,205
Nobody knows what they are.
Maybe what you do is who you are.

230
00:18:30,813 --> 00:18:32,542
But I don't know what I'm doing!

231
00:18:36,252 --> 00:18:37,586
Maybe I don't know who I am or...

232
00:18:37,587 --> 00:18:40,784
what I'm doing.

233
00:18:44,993 --> 00:18:48,760
I don't know how anyone
can have a sense of self in this...

234
00:18:48,998 --> 00:18:52,559
fractured modern time
of mediate...

235
00:18:52,802 --> 00:18:56,863
tiranized, fascist, body-obsessed...

236
00:18:57,173 --> 00:19:02,306
global domination,
political turmoil, human...

237
00:19:02,547 --> 00:19:05,812
- Okay, Sam.
...this time of human depravity...

238
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:08,177
Sam, okay, okay, okay, stop.

239
00:19:11,622 --> 00:19:13,556
Are you okay?

240
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:15,588
Yeah.

241
00:19:16,928 --> 00:19:20,557
- What the fuck is that?
- Don't even try to understand it.

242
00:19:20,798 --> 00:19:22,992
It's pretty sophisticated piece.

243
00:19:24,067 --> 00:19:27,901
- Go fuck yourself.
- What if I could.

244
00:19:28,972 --> 00:19:31,702
Oh, God, I got another audition.

245
00:19:32,476 --> 00:19:33,876
What for?

246
00:19:33,877 --> 00:19:37,141
I don't know, some WB show.

247
00:19:37,613 --> 00:19:40,446
"Undercover Gimnasts".

248
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:42,542
Ove you.

249
00:19:44,621 --> 00:19:46,612
Well, why aren't I
going out on that?

250
00:20:04,909 --> 00:20:06,604
Thank you!

251
00:20:11,016 --> 00:20:14,850
<i>We want you
If your lover's cold</i>

252
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:39,367
Hey, baby, I didn't know
that you were home.

253
00:20:40,078 --> 00:20:43,241
I wasn't. Did you notice that?

254
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:49,348
I like your hair. I like that.

255
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:54,659
I like the radiating things, and
the antennas, and the butterflies.

256
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:57,221
That's really nice, I like that.

257
00:20:57,629 --> 00:21:00,597
Pink and blue. It's like male/female.
Are you alright?

258
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,700
What?

259
00:21:02,701 --> 00:21:06,365
What did I say? I liked it.
I didn't say I didn't like it.

260
00:21:23,589 --> 00:21:25,523
What?

261
00:21:28,059 --> 00:21:29,686
What's the matter?

262
00:21:29,927 --> 00:21:31,451
Are you mad at me or something?
You wanna talk about it?

263
00:21:35,734 --> 00:21:38,294
I think you broke
my nose here. Hello?

264
00:21:38,804 --> 00:21:41,795
- Come on, man?
- No! You come on, Justin!

265
00:21:42,039 --> 00:21:45,770
- "You come on".
- You're a fucking wanker!

266
00:21:46,744 --> 00:21:48,646
I'm a fucking wanker.

267
00:21:50,283 --> 00:21:52,615
I'm kidding. What are you
so pissed off about?

268
00:21:54,153 --> 00:21:57,122
Come on, don't you wanna play?

269
00:23:11,665 --> 00:23:13,165
Fuck!

270
00:23:13,534 --> 00:23:15,126
Come on!

271
00:23:16,503 --> 00:23:20,405
Man, I came up with this
great song. I just finished it.

272
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:22,771
It's really cool.

273
00:23:23,076 --> 00:23:26,808
It's like this... Got this
ynyrd Skynyrd vibe...

274
00:23:27,047 --> 00:23:30,379
but I threw a little of Darby Crash,
from the Germs in...

275
00:23:30,617 --> 00:23:32,642
and a little bit of like...

276
00:23:32,886 --> 00:23:36,583
There's some Zeppelin, and there's
a little bit of lggy Pop vibe going.

277
00:23:36,823 --> 00:23:38,816
It kind of goes like this...

278
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:43,327
Simple pause.

279
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:47,999
Isn't that fucking cool?
I love that.

280
00:23:50,772 --> 00:23:53,673
I think it can really work,
you know.

281
00:23:53,909 --> 00:23:57,310
Maybe you can help me come up with
another thing, another riff, like:

282
00:23:57,578 --> 00:24:00,411
"I love you" or "hate you",
whatever...

283
00:24:00,648 --> 00:24:03,276
'cause, you know,
love is about hate too, right?

284
00:24:03,517 --> 00:24:05,678
- It's good, it's good.
- I think so too.

285
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:08,753
<i>I think I don't want to be
in this relationship anymore.</i>

286
00:24:10,658 --> 00:24:13,559
No, I'm sure I don't wanna be.

287
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:20,326
But I don't wanna be alone.

288
00:24:26,373 --> 00:24:29,467
I feel suffocated.

289
00:24:30,578 --> 00:24:33,743
What is suffocating you?

290
00:24:36,118 --> 00:24:38,052
This city.

291
00:24:38,287 --> 00:24:42,450
It's that I feel like...

292
00:24:42,691 --> 00:24:48,187
I'm waiting for my life
to start, you know?

293
00:24:51,133 --> 00:24:57,002
Ike what's going on now
is all just like a big rehearsal...

294
00:24:57,238 --> 00:24:58,967
for something bigger.

295
00:24:59,207 --> 00:25:02,005
It's all temporary. It's just...

296
00:25:04,012 --> 00:25:08,505
Maybe I'm scared to start my life.

297
00:25:13,187 --> 00:25:16,385
Are you the part of Ellie that's
scared to let her start her life?

298
00:25:17,192 --> 00:25:22,289
I wore dirty clothes...

299
00:25:22,764 --> 00:25:25,028
and then I smelled...

300
00:25:26,134 --> 00:25:28,798
and because they said...

301
00:25:31,441 --> 00:25:34,637
I looked like a kangaroo.

302
00:25:36,045 --> 00:25:38,673
Thank you for talking to me today.

303
00:25:38,914 --> 00:25:41,713
We'll talk to you again soon, okay?

304
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:47,017
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

305
00:25:55,698 --> 00:26:00,192
And I was always on the outside,
always trying to fit in, always...

306
00:26:00,436 --> 00:26:03,495
trying to be accepted, to be
liked and pleasing people.

307
00:26:03,738 --> 00:26:06,229
That's what happens
as an actor in the rooms.

308
00:26:06,474 --> 00:26:09,205
You go into these rooms and...

309
00:26:11,247 --> 00:26:14,774
you audition and you have
to show yourself and...

310
00:26:15,017 --> 00:26:18,645
these people don't like you
and it's like you can't...

311
00:26:21,891 --> 00:26:25,488
you can't be yourself because
you're always being judged.

312
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:31,592
I wish I could be brave enough
to do that in the audition room.

313
00:26:35,505 --> 00:26:37,406
Fuck!

314
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:50,950
Ellie, you have some mascara...

315
00:26:51,555 --> 00:26:53,682
- Here?
Both eyes.

316
00:26:54,458 --> 00:26:58,416
That would've been strange walking
into my next audition...

317
00:26:59,128 --> 00:27:00,628
like that.

318
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:04,599
Oh, God, I hadn't let go
like that in a long time.

319
00:27:04,835 --> 00:27:08,566
- It's good for you.
- It is. It feels good.

320
00:27:09,639 --> 00:27:11,765
So...

321
00:27:13,576 --> 00:27:17,412
...thank you. It was really good.
- You're welcome.

322
00:27:17,749 --> 00:27:20,445
- I like your sweater.
- Oh, thank you.

323
00:27:20,885 --> 00:27:23,683
- It's nice. Where did you get it?
- At imited.

324
00:27:24,087 --> 00:27:28,252
All right. Oh, good, good.
How much was it?

325
00:27:29,026 --> 00:27:32,861
Oh, gosh... 29 dollars.

326
00:27:33,232 --> 00:27:36,395
That's great. I might just...
Was it just recently?

327
00:27:36,635 --> 00:27:40,161
'Cause I've been looking
for a nice cheap sweater that...

328
00:27:40,404 --> 00:27:43,567
You know, a plain black sweater.

329
00:27:44,142 --> 00:27:46,440
So, Wednesday?

330
00:28:08,331 --> 00:28:10,663
- Thank you.
- Anything else?

331
00:29:58,143 --> 00:30:00,475
- That's great.
- Oh, no.

332
00:30:01,179 --> 00:30:03,741
Oh, my God, I'm gonna cum.

333
00:30:06,053 --> 00:30:07,577
Oh, my God!

334
00:30:07,821 --> 00:30:10,118
Oh, God, yeah, like that.

335
00:30:18,065 --> 00:30:21,193
Gosh, like that.

336
00:30:30,743 --> 00:30:32,768
Oh, God. Ellie!

337
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:36,474
Hey, you motherfucker!

338
00:30:36,882 --> 00:30:38,976
Hey, baby.

339
00:30:39,986 --> 00:30:41,817
I tried to call your new cell phone.

340
00:30:47,194 --> 00:30:49,025
Were there any calls for me?

341
00:30:49,263 --> 00:30:51,890
No, no, not one.

342
00:30:54,567 --> 00:30:56,728
Ellie...

343
00:30:58,974 --> 00:31:00,474
Yikes!

344
00:31:01,609 --> 00:31:04,202
You fucking asshole!

345
00:31:04,945 --> 00:31:08,005
- Oh, my God!
- Ellie, wait!

346
00:31:09,183 --> 00:31:10,683
Fuck!

347
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:14,315
Wait!

348
00:31:22,997 --> 00:31:25,625
Fuck! Fucking...

349
00:31:27,034 --> 00:31:30,367
No, no, no!

350
00:31:35,041 --> 00:31:37,009
Oh, God.

351
00:31:38,512 --> 00:31:42,313
Asshole. Fucking asshole.

352
00:31:56,265 --> 00:31:58,859
I just fucking hit somebody.

353
00:32:01,603 --> 00:32:03,366
- I just...
- You're fucking crazy?

354
00:32:03,605 --> 00:32:05,630
- Ook at my fucking car!
- I'll call you back.

355
00:32:05,874 --> 00:32:09,140
Oh, my God, look at my car!
What do you...? You're fucking crazy?

356
00:32:09,378 --> 00:32:11,403
- I just hit somebody.
- Can you get off that phone?

357
00:32:11,647 --> 00:32:15,377
Fucking hell, I'm really sorry.
I didn't see you, I was on my phone.

358
00:32:15,617 --> 00:32:18,108
You shouldn't fucking drive
while you're talking on the cell.

359
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:22,983
If you wanna talk, go home.
Don't drive and talk on the phone.

360
00:32:23,224 --> 00:32:24,724
I'm sorry.

361
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:27,994
- Do you have pen and paper?
- You have blue stuff on your face.

362
00:32:31,632 --> 00:32:33,931
- Are you sure you're okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

363
00:32:34,169 --> 00:32:38,196
Et me just back up.
I'm not leaving, I'm not leaving.

364
00:32:39,741 --> 00:32:42,072
- Are you sure you're okay?
- I've got your number plate.

365
00:32:42,543 --> 00:32:46,173
- Do not drive away.
- I promise I won't drive away.

366
00:32:49,653 --> 00:32:52,816
- Wow, my car is fine, so...
- Well, that makes sense.

367
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:57,086
You wanna try to maybe snap this
back on? Try to drive home.

368
00:32:57,326 --> 00:33:00,318
It won't touch here. I'll get...

369
00:33:14,009 --> 00:33:17,308
- Wow, what are these things?
- It's very expensive that dress.

370
00:33:17,546 --> 00:33:20,709
These are my pills, they are
homeopathic, they're for...

371
00:33:21,417 --> 00:33:22,916
healing...

372
00:33:23,384 --> 00:33:26,285
- You're an actress?
- Yes.

373
00:33:26,521 --> 00:33:29,082
- I like your picture.
- Thanks.

374
00:33:29,725 --> 00:33:32,592
I'm incredibly sorry.
I'm really sorry.

375
00:33:39,534 --> 00:33:43,370
Don't worry. Don't worry
about this. It's fine, it's cool.

376
00:33:43,607 --> 00:33:45,107
I'll give you my phone number...

377
00:33:45,175 --> 00:33:48,167
Okay, I can't give you my phone
number, but if you give me yours...

378
00:33:48,411 --> 00:33:50,811
- I'll give you mine and...
- I got your license plate...

379
00:33:51,047 --> 00:33:54,346
and I'd like your
driver's license number.

380
00:33:54,784 --> 00:33:57,015
- Okay, cool.
- Okay.

381
00:33:57,255 --> 00:33:59,485
- So...
- I'm really sorry.

382
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:02,520
- I'll give you my phone number.
- Okay, great.

383
00:34:02,959 --> 00:34:05,792
Make sure when you call
say it's about the car accident.

384
00:34:06,196 --> 00:34:08,494
Okay. Are you under
house arrest or something?

385
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:11,360
No, I'm just...

386
00:34:11,601 --> 00:34:15,128
I'm breaking up with
my boyfriend. It's just...

387
00:34:15,405 --> 00:34:17,770
- What did you say you do?
- You didn't ask me.

388
00:34:18,007 --> 00:34:21,306
- Sorry. You asked me.
- I'm a cinematographer.

389
00:34:21,544 --> 00:34:23,672
Oh, really? In films?

390
00:34:24,447 --> 00:34:27,974
No, I want to. I'm shooting
commercials right now.

391
00:34:28,218 --> 00:34:30,549
- Oh, nice.
- But I'd like to shoot films.

392
00:34:30,786 --> 00:34:34,187
Sometimes cinematographers
turn into filmmakers, don't they?

393
00:34:34,423 --> 00:34:36,550
Yeah. There are a lot of people...

394
00:34:36,892 --> 00:34:40,193
who were cinematographers
and now they're filmmakers.

395
00:34:40,431 --> 00:34:43,730
If you wanna do any kind
of experimental ideas...

396
00:34:43,968 --> 00:34:48,131
or whatever, shoot it, just
make a short film, I'd love to.

397
00:34:48,371 --> 00:34:50,066
- Really? That's great.
- I'm gonna give you my head shot.

398
00:34:50,307 --> 00:34:51,808
Oh, great.

399
00:34:52,376 --> 00:34:54,709
- You look better.
- Well, then don't take this.

400
00:34:56,281 --> 00:35:00,910
Here's the bit with my agent's
number, keep that. Is it an eye?

401
00:35:01,152 --> 00:35:03,382
Can I have an eye? Oh, I like
this part, that's really nice.

402
00:35:03,621 --> 00:35:06,351
- You could do that...
- That's good. But I still...

403
00:36:35,547 --> 00:36:38,607
You know, you're welcome
to stay for as long as you need to.

404
00:36:38,850 --> 00:36:40,681
Thanks.

405
00:36:41,921 --> 00:36:45,880
At least you won't have to listen
to those stupid songs anymore.

406
00:36:47,959 --> 00:36:50,359
Or have to watch him play guitar.

407
00:36:50,762 --> 00:36:53,356
- That's awful.
- It's like watch him masturbate.

408
00:37:02,374 --> 00:37:05,605
That's so beautiful.

409
00:37:10,383 --> 00:37:15,479
God, I just wish I could disappear
into some great role, you know?

410
00:37:15,721 --> 00:37:18,656
Not just a cop, or a lawyer,
or a girlfriend.

411
00:37:18,890 --> 00:37:22,623
I wanna play a real person,
you know?

412
00:37:23,197 --> 00:37:27,566
God, it's so dry out there.
We really need some rain.

413
00:37:27,801 --> 00:37:32,828
You know what would be great?
To play a schizophrenic woman.

414
00:37:33,339 --> 00:37:38,676
A blind lesbian anthropologist.

415
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:44,073
Yeah, yeah. It's the 1700's, and
she's got dengue fever, and she's...

416
00:37:44,317 --> 00:37:50,085
studying baboons.
Wouldn't that be good?

417
00:37:50,656 --> 00:37:54,285
- Lf I should I hire a lawyer?
- Maybe...

418
00:37:55,194 --> 00:37:58,959
- What's that fucking noise?
- Don't know. Someone should shoot.

419
00:37:59,765 --> 00:38:02,063
I feel like Humpty Dumpty.

420
00:38:02,968 --> 00:38:05,734
Maybe I should hire a publicist.

421
00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:13,709
Maybe I should set myself on fire.

422
00:38:15,114 --> 00:38:16,515
Who?

423
00:38:16,516 --> 00:38:18,679
- Where are you?
- I'm sorry.

424
00:38:19,087 --> 00:38:23,251
You know, I think I'm a little
hypoglycemic. Ook at me, shaking.

425
00:38:23,491 --> 00:38:26,721
I need some food, quickly.
I haven't eaten for like 2 hours.

426
00:38:26,994 --> 00:38:29,326
Come on, let's go.

427
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:19,979
Isten.

428
00:39:21,149 --> 00:39:23,743
- Isten.
- I think it's Justin.

429
00:39:24,285 --> 00:39:25,912
Fuck, Ellie!

430
00:39:29,425 --> 00:39:31,552
- Hi. Et me in.
- No!

431
00:39:31,794 --> 00:39:33,293
- Go away!
- You said you loved me.

432
00:39:33,528 --> 00:39:35,257
- What?
- You said you loved me.

433
00:39:35,830 --> 00:39:38,196
Fuck you! I don't hate
myself enough to love you!

434
00:39:38,566 --> 00:39:40,500
I hate you.
I'm fucking trying to sleep.

435
00:39:40,735 --> 00:39:42,635
Fuck you!

436
00:39:43,505 --> 00:39:47,873
Cock breath, I don't know what kind
of soap opera you think you're in...

437
00:39:48,108 --> 00:39:50,941
Fuck off, you fucking cow.
How's that?

438
00:39:51,411 --> 00:39:53,744
Fuck me? Fuck me?
Fuck you!

439
00:39:54,048 --> 00:39:56,744
Justin. Sam! Honey...

440
00:39:59,087 --> 00:40:00,883
Go, she's coming!
She's coming!

441
00:40:01,421 --> 00:40:03,013
Fuck.

442
00:40:06,693 --> 00:40:10,028
How dare you come here
after what you've done to her...

443
00:40:10,266 --> 00:40:13,532
and how dare you call me a cow?
Fuck off!

444
00:40:13,770 --> 00:40:15,136
- Fuck off!
- Don't hurt him!

445
00:40:15,137 --> 00:40:17,935
- Get in!
- Are you all right, Justin?

446
00:40:19,308 --> 00:40:23,109
- He has a violent history.
- All right.

447
00:40:35,925 --> 00:40:38,416
I want my green shirt back.

448
00:40:47,135 --> 00:40:49,297
That's good.

449
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:55,305
He was retarding you, Ellie,
and this...

450
00:40:56,144 --> 00:41:00,706
He was this fucking... It'll be good
for you to stay alone for a while.

451
00:41:00,949 --> 00:41:04,216
No, no, no. I'm gonna go
insane if I'm alone.

452
00:41:04,454 --> 00:41:07,787
I just wanna be in a relationship
where I can be myself, you know?

453
00:41:08,024 --> 00:41:11,754
I don't have to be what I think
the man wants me to be.

454
00:41:13,362 --> 00:41:18,301
We live in a place where everyone
is pretending to be someone else.

455
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:23,706
What happens when you start becoming
the person you're pretending to be?

456
00:41:24,507 --> 00:41:29,740
Well, I think you become
the person that wears mini skirts.

457
00:41:30,513 --> 00:41:33,004
That's... I like that.

458
00:41:33,249 --> 00:41:36,945
You know, the thing is it's gonna
be good for your work, Ellie.

459
00:41:37,186 --> 00:41:39,484
This shit informs it, you know that.

460
00:41:39,722 --> 00:41:42,691
Once you get passed it, think about
what it will bring to the roles.

461
00:41:42,925 --> 00:41:46,384
And probably you'll get
better roles from it.

462
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:49,622
- Don't you think?
- Yeah, you could be right.

463
00:41:49,866 --> 00:41:51,992
Right.

464
00:41:53,168 --> 00:41:55,295
I've got a couple of good rolls.

465
00:41:56,071 --> 00:41:58,303
I wouldn't complain
about those rolls.

466
00:41:58,542 --> 00:42:00,840
What about that roll?
That's one great roll.

467
00:42:01,078 --> 00:42:05,138
Isn't it?
That's a roll I'll never get.

468
00:42:08,284 --> 00:42:12,312
No, you'll just get stuck
with old big parts.

469
00:42:13,290 --> 00:42:18,090
This is what it must feel like to
have a cock. I wish I had a cock.

470
00:42:18,328 --> 00:42:20,159
Why? That's so unfair!

471
00:42:20,397 --> 00:42:23,367
That's so 70's of you.

472
00:42:24,502 --> 00:42:30,600
Remember when the future
was a promise?

473
00:42:32,208 --> 00:42:35,006
Now it's like a threat.

474
00:42:40,084 --> 00:42:42,518
You think I look old?

475
00:42:43,788 --> 00:42:46,483
Don't be ridiculous.

476
00:42:48,892 --> 00:42:51,053
I don't wanna die.

477
00:42:51,294 --> 00:42:53,457
What are you saying?

478
00:42:55,333 --> 00:42:56,801
What are you saying?

479
00:42:56,802 --> 00:42:59,998
What if, what if I... I...

480
00:43:00,905 --> 00:43:04,397
dropped dead? What if
I had cancer? What if I...

481
00:43:04,642 --> 00:43:06,474
had an aneurism? What if?

482
00:43:06,712 --> 00:43:10,944
I would be so sad if you died.
I would go to your funeral.

483
00:43:11,183 --> 00:43:12,707
- You do?
- I'd get a new dress.

484
00:43:12,951 --> 00:43:15,919
I'd pound your coffin
and try to scream:

485
00:43:16,153 --> 00:43:19,088
"Get up! Get up!
Give me one last hug!"

486
00:43:19,323 --> 00:43:22,156
- You're making like it's a scene.
- No, I'm just serious.

487
00:43:22,393 --> 00:43:24,623
I don't want a scene. I'm serious.

488
00:43:24,862 --> 00:43:28,195
No, I love you, darling.
I love you.

489
00:43:28,766 --> 00:43:31,997
I love you.
You're my best friend.

490
00:43:33,738 --> 00:43:39,905
<i>Now just picture you're in a big
bathtub filled with Jell-O right now.</i>

491
00:43:41,078 --> 00:43:43,478
Orange Jell-O.

492
00:43:43,948 --> 00:43:48,944
Et every part of yourself
just sink into the floor.

493
00:43:49,689 --> 00:43:52,522
Et go of your Hollywood crap...

494
00:43:54,327 --> 00:43:59,195
trying to be Gwyneth Paltrow
or Brad Pitt...

495
00:44:00,499 --> 00:44:05,528
your agents,
your casting directors.

496
00:44:06,005 --> 00:44:08,438
Just let them all go up
into a big ball of fire.

497
00:44:10,275 --> 00:44:15,212
Okay, now I want you to ask your
creative source to give you an event.

498
00:44:15,914 --> 00:44:18,815
An event when
you were 10 years-old.

499
00:44:19,885 --> 00:44:23,911
You can go right into that event,
as if you were in a time machine.

500
00:44:24,155 --> 00:44:26,055
Really be there.

501
00:44:26,624 --> 00:44:30,221
Good, Ellie.
Et go of the tension on your face.

502
00:44:30,930 --> 00:44:34,991
This is not a therapy session.
This is acting.

503
00:44:47,447 --> 00:44:50,279
Good, you're 9 years-old, vomiting.

504
00:44:51,651 --> 00:44:54,313
There's no one there to help you.

505
00:44:55,454 --> 00:44:58,288
Et it all relax.

506
00:44:58,525 --> 00:45:00,493
Ook at me.

507
00:45:00,794 --> 00:45:02,853
Esbian.

508
00:45:03,329 --> 00:45:07,857
- Go!
- Esbian! Esbian! Esbian!

509
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:10,830
- Good.
- It's not appropriate!

510
00:45:11,237 --> 00:45:13,728
- It's not appropriate!
- Good.

511
00:45:14,173 --> 00:45:18,506
And just say like a little scream
into your pillow. A little scream.

512
00:45:19,477 --> 00:45:25,246
My little brother was standing there
with one of my Barbies in his hand.

513
00:45:26,686 --> 00:45:29,883
And her hair was on fire.
Stop it, Toby!

514
00:45:30,223 --> 00:45:33,681
And he was burning my curtains.

515
00:45:35,061 --> 00:45:36,585
Beautiful.

516
00:45:40,235 --> 00:45:41,501
That was beautiful.

517
00:45:41,502 --> 00:45:44,664
Then we sit down at the dining
room table, like she tells us to.

518
00:45:44,905 --> 00:45:48,204
And she brings
these huge plates. Plates...

519
00:45:48,442 --> 00:45:52,277
pilled high: Steak, chips...

520
00:45:52,513 --> 00:45:55,949
carrots, peas, like this
enormous amount of food.

521
00:45:56,184 --> 00:46:00,381
And we're like: "Mom, what are you
doing? What are you doing? No!"

522
00:46:00,621 --> 00:46:04,148
And she's like force-feeding us,
putting it in our mouth.

523
00:46:04,825 --> 00:46:06,325
Good, take it and
put it in your mouth.,

524
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:08,755
"You eat it, girls!
You eat! You must eat!"

525
00:46:08,996 --> 00:46:12,954
Take a big handful.
The other handful. Another handful.

526
00:46:13,199 --> 00:46:17,533
Good. Big peas.
Spit out the peas. Good.

527
00:46:17,770 --> 00:46:20,399
- And when I...
- Take the peas back, off the plate...

528
00:46:20,641 --> 00:46:22,768
stuff them in and spit them out.

529
00:46:23,243 --> 00:46:26,177
Ellie, don't hold back.
Spit them out.

530
00:46:27,313 --> 00:46:31,306
Mush the food. Keep mushing.
Turn that fucking cell phone off.

531
00:46:32,485 --> 00:46:34,785
Is it? Mush it!

532
00:46:35,590 --> 00:46:40,459
And we would say: "Mom, mom,
no, we already had dinner!"

533
00:46:41,529 --> 00:46:46,125
We had dinner tonight.
Don't you remember?"

534
00:46:48,904 --> 00:46:50,531
Nice.

535
00:46:50,773 --> 00:46:53,263
Now, get up.
Don't get indulgent.

536
00:46:53,508 --> 00:46:55,373
Gesture.

537
00:46:56,811 --> 00:46:58,608
Good, again.

538
00:46:59,881 --> 00:47:04,341
Ellie, quiet.
Do the opposite. Opposite.

539
00:47:04,585 --> 00:47:06,746
Good, good.

540
00:47:06,987 --> 00:47:09,512
And now the opposite of that.
Go! Angry!

541
00:47:12,592 --> 00:47:14,288
Give me a hug.

542
00:47:14,529 --> 00:47:15,996
Very good.

543
00:47:15,997 --> 00:47:18,522
Yeah, Ellie!

544
00:47:18,833 --> 00:47:22,268
Okay, lastly, we're all gonna
work at animals for about 5 minutes.

545
00:47:31,313 --> 00:47:35,442
A kangaroo. Et's see you hop,
shake your butt.

546
00:47:37,085 --> 00:47:39,383
I'll be right back.

547
00:47:43,626 --> 00:47:46,595
You think Meryl Streep
had to do this shit?

548
00:48:09,985 --> 00:48:12,783
You look very preoccupied.

549
00:48:14,023 --> 00:48:16,149
I'm fine.

550
00:48:16,491 --> 00:48:19,483
You're still there.
What's the matter?

551
00:48:19,727 --> 00:48:21,490
Are you bummed
he didn't offer you a line?

552
00:48:22,063 --> 00:48:26,695
Everyone had these big
personal events. Mine was lame.

553
00:48:28,571 --> 00:48:30,800
I'm an idiot.

554
00:48:31,206 --> 00:48:33,902
That's ridiculous, Ellie.
You were very, very good today.

555
00:48:34,143 --> 00:48:38,843
Easy for you to say.
Yours was huge.

556
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:42,210
You burned your house down
with your brother.

557
00:48:42,452 --> 00:48:44,715
You never even told me that.

558
00:48:46,756 --> 00:48:49,122
No wonder you're such
a good actress.

559
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:53,762
You have all this shit in your life
that you can just draw off from.

560
00:48:55,065 --> 00:48:56,623
It's deep.

561
00:48:56,866 --> 00:48:59,561
And I'm just like
this shallow bird bath.

562
00:49:01,637 --> 00:49:04,402
- I made it up.
- What?

563
00:49:05,475 --> 00:49:07,807
I made it up, my personal event.

564
00:49:08,311 --> 00:49:11,302
You made up your personal event?

565
00:49:11,814 --> 00:49:16,513
Come on, Ellie! You know I like to
practice my American accent in class.

566
00:49:17,152 --> 00:49:20,146
Sometimes I make things up
so I can practice my acting!

567
00:49:20,491 --> 00:49:23,551
What's the point? It defeats the
purpose. The whole point is to...

568
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:27,752
use something that really happened in
your life and put it in your acting.

569
00:49:27,997 --> 00:49:33,698
Oh, bullshit. I think the
whole method thing is a wank.

570
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:37,270
I think sense memory
is so self-indulgent.

571
00:49:37,508 --> 00:49:42,308
No, see, it's not. You draw
from your life experience...

572
00:49:42,545 --> 00:49:44,479
and you personalize it and put it
into your work. It makes it real...

573
00:49:44,714 --> 00:49:47,774
and it makes it honest.

574
00:49:48,017 --> 00:49:50,111
And that's how
you make a scene work.

575
00:49:50,354 --> 00:49:53,618
Bullshit, Ellie! Sorry!

576
00:49:53,857 --> 00:49:59,660
How many times are you gonna cry
about your drunk mother? It's boring!

577
00:49:59,897 --> 00:50:04,800
It's far more real, truthful and
honest if you use your imagination.

578
00:50:05,035 --> 00:50:07,332
And it's limitless.

579
00:50:10,940 --> 00:50:15,311
Okay. Et's try something.

580
00:50:16,381 --> 00:50:19,781
Et's put your theory to test.

581
00:50:20,184 --> 00:50:23,210
Et's see who can cry first.

582
00:50:23,988 --> 00:50:26,422
- On the count of three.
- All right.

583
00:50:26,725 --> 00:50:29,694
One, two...

584
00:50:31,062 --> 00:50:32,927
three.

585
00:50:48,444 --> 00:50:51,004
I'm starting to get one.

586
00:50:53,951 --> 00:50:55,977
It's not real. It's crocodile.

587
00:50:56,221 --> 00:50:59,088
Yeah, it is. It's real, right now.
It's gonna spill out in a second.

588
00:50:59,324 --> 00:51:02,417
- You're not crying.
- Yeah, one on the left eye.

589
00:51:09,535 --> 00:51:14,665
You see, that's dignifying 'cause I
don't have to use any loud whaling...

590
00:51:15,173 --> 00:51:17,698
and it looks like I'm holding back.

591
00:51:18,810 --> 00:51:23,214
- My nose is going too.
- I'm drawing from my own pain.

592
00:51:23,449 --> 00:51:27,852
You don't understand, see? Ook
at this. You think that's faking it?

593
00:51:28,321 --> 00:51:30,185
I think that gets
a little embarrassing.

594
00:51:30,422 --> 00:51:35,724
It's dignifying about holding back
and letting one just spill out...

595
00:51:35,961 --> 00:51:38,361
gently. It's something real, Ellie!

596
00:51:38,597 --> 00:51:40,792
You don't understand.

597
00:51:42,033 --> 00:51:44,398
That shop! You see that shop?

598
00:51:44,635 --> 00:51:46,432
- I wanna go there.
- What?

599
00:51:46,670 --> 00:51:49,538
I wanted to go there for so long.
I'm so glad that that's there.

600
00:51:49,774 --> 00:51:51,833
- Oh, hang on. What...
- Hang on, I can't park here.

601
00:51:52,077 --> 00:51:53,704
I didn't bring my wallet.

602
00:52:09,096 --> 00:52:11,495
Oh, I need a set of tea trays.

603
00:52:22,409 --> 00:52:25,468
- I'll be right out!
- It's okay, we're fine.

604
00:52:25,811 --> 00:52:27,802
Just looking around.

605
00:52:28,714 --> 00:52:30,773
I hear Australians.

606
00:52:32,251 --> 00:52:34,481
You guys are everywhere.

607
00:52:34,820 --> 00:52:37,015
If he says "good day",
I'll kill him.

608
00:52:38,256 --> 00:52:39,756
Good day.

609
00:52:40,558 --> 00:52:42,321
- May I help you?
- Oh, my God, hi!

610
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:47,624
- I didn't realize you worked here.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

611
00:52:47,867 --> 00:52:49,732
Hi, how are you?

612
00:52:50,603 --> 00:52:53,969
- I'm good, how are you?
- I'm good.

613
00:52:56,574 --> 00:52:59,306
My car is gonna be fixed
by the end of the day.

614
00:52:59,646 --> 00:53:03,139
And I have a dentist
appointment on Thursday.

615
00:53:06,186 --> 00:53:09,952
Sam, this is Chris. Chris, right.
He crashed into me last week.

616
00:53:10,524 --> 00:53:13,460
No, no, I'm Tom,
I'm Chris's twin brother.

617
00:53:13,695 --> 00:53:18,257
And he look really crashed into.
I heard about you.

618
00:53:18,565 --> 00:53:20,294
Wait.

619
00:53:22,169 --> 00:53:23,436
Funny.

620
00:53:23,437 --> 00:53:26,895
No, I really am Tom,
his twin brother.

621
00:53:27,140 --> 00:53:30,667
Happens all the time. People think
we're the same person, but we're not.

622
00:53:31,111 --> 00:53:32,610
We have different hair.

623
00:53:32,712 --> 00:53:37,046
And he drives a Honda Civic, and
I don't drive because I'm epileptic.

624
00:53:37,883 --> 00:53:39,384
So...

625
00:53:39,886 --> 00:53:42,150
- Oh, my God.
- What?

626
00:53:43,724 --> 00:53:47,386
Wow, you guys look a lot alike.

627
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:52,260
- Yeah. So, how is your car?
- It's good, it's getting fixed.

628
00:53:52,631 --> 00:53:56,467
You paid... No, your brother paid
for it, and it will be fixed.

629
00:53:56,838 --> 00:53:59,602
I know he felt real bad about
what happened and...

630
00:54:00,073 --> 00:54:02,974
He's a terrible driver, just awful.
He's always banging into stuff.

631
00:54:03,210 --> 00:54:07,148
I'm a better driver than he is
and I don't drive, I'm epileptic.

632
00:54:07,383 --> 00:54:09,749
But it's good to meet you.
I'll tell him I saw you.

633
00:54:09,985 --> 00:54:12,112
- Yes, yes, say hi.
- Sure. It's weird.

634
00:54:12,354 --> 00:54:14,412
- I know, it's weird.
- Yeah, he really...

635
00:54:17,258 --> 00:54:19,624
- I have to go, I got that thing.
- What thing?

636
00:54:21,662 --> 00:54:26,326
Sorry, we should go.
She's got a thing, so...

637
00:54:27,234 --> 00:54:31,034
- Well, good luck on your thing.
- Thanks.

638
00:54:33,273 --> 00:54:35,105
- Bye.
- Bye.

639
00:54:45,819 --> 00:54:47,377
Oh, my God!

640
00:54:47,621 --> 00:54:49,284
Shit! Shit!

641
00:54:49,525 --> 00:54:53,325
Hi, I'm sorry, I just...
I am Chris, I lied.

642
00:54:53,662 --> 00:54:57,495
I'm sorry. I was embarrassed because
I told you I was a cinematographer.

643
00:54:57,732 --> 00:55:01,190
I'm really embarrassed. You busted
me where I work and I feel really...

644
00:55:01,436 --> 00:55:04,634
I'm really ashamed of myself,
I'm really sorry. I just...

645
00:55:04,873 --> 00:55:06,500
I didn't want you to get away.

646
00:55:06,742 --> 00:55:08,834
- Are you an epileptic?
- No, I lied about that too.

647
00:55:09,077 --> 00:55:11,011
- Oh, no!
- Wait, wait!

648
00:55:11,246 --> 00:55:13,771
- Wait!
- I just...

649
00:55:14,016 --> 00:55:17,952
I go to AFI and I'm going to be
a cinematographer. And I'm just...

650
00:55:19,154 --> 00:55:21,952
I'm really sorry.
I really like you and...

651
00:55:22,191 --> 00:55:26,593
Okay, don't worry.
You're crazy, but it's okay.

652
00:55:26,828 --> 00:55:28,955
I feel really bad.
Can I make it up to you?

653
00:55:29,198 --> 00:55:32,725
Isten, my band's playing tonight.
Well, my friends' band, Dogstart.

654
00:55:32,968 --> 00:55:35,869
They're really good. And I'd
love it if you went with me.

655
00:55:36,504 --> 00:55:40,201
- Okay.
- You too. You both can come.

656
00:55:40,441 --> 00:55:46,404
So, I have your number. I'll call you
when I get out. It could be great.

657
00:55:46,649 --> 00:55:50,049
She's a very popular girl, you know
that. You're luck she's available.

658
00:55:50,285 --> 00:55:52,776
- Thank you, Sam.
- Really, very.

659
00:55:53,021 --> 00:55:54,521
Bye!

660
00:55:57,327 --> 00:56:00,660
Just your type. Sociopath.

661
00:56:21,149 --> 00:56:23,208
Oh, my God, this is really fake.

662
00:56:35,197 --> 00:56:39,192
3 Vicodin just doesn't do it
for me anymore. At least not orally.

663
00:56:39,436 --> 00:56:41,063
Really? Have you tried Norco?

664
00:56:41,305 --> 00:56:44,899
- Were you just talking about Vicodin?
- Pretty good. Yeah.

665
00:56:45,141 --> 00:56:47,200
I love Vicodin.
I'm like Marilyn Monroe.

666
00:56:48,011 --> 00:56:50,775
- Really?
- Oh, my God, wait! Acting class!

667
00:56:51,014 --> 00:56:53,483
- Right.
- What are you doing here?

668
00:56:53,884 --> 00:56:57,752
- Of course I'm here.
- Yeah, right. I love your glitter.

669
00:56:59,122 --> 00:57:03,354
- It's what drag queens wear?
- Can I have another vodka?

670
00:57:06,529 --> 00:57:09,726
Hey, you guys were great tonight.
That was really cool. How you doing?

671
00:57:09,966 --> 00:57:11,524
- This is my friend Ellie.
- Hi, hi.

672
00:57:11,768 --> 00:57:15,362
- And this is Sam.
- That was so great. Really good.

673
00:57:15,604 --> 00:57:17,105
- One second.
- Are you in the band?

674
00:57:17,340 --> 00:57:21,209
- He's in the band too.
- You're in. Nice to meet you.

675
00:57:21,445 --> 00:57:26,313
You know what's really funny? So many
people who want to say hello to you.

676
00:57:26,549 --> 00:57:30,144
- Yeah? From where?
- Sydney, from the Matrix.

677
00:57:30,386 --> 00:57:32,948
- So many, so many people.
- We're Australian.

678
00:57:33,191 --> 00:57:35,523
- Come with me, please.
- Yeah, sure.

679
00:57:35,794 --> 00:57:37,887
What's up?

680
00:57:38,563 --> 00:57:41,156
- Who?
- I'm so glad you took him out.

681
00:57:41,398 --> 00:57:46,233
- Anyway, the concept was fantastic.
- So good. How did you get in acting?

682
00:57:46,470 --> 00:57:48,200
What? What?

683
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:50,735
What are you doing?

684
00:57:51,676 --> 00:57:55,338
You're really, really drunk
and you're embarrassing yourself.

685
00:57:55,579 --> 00:57:58,241
- What are you talking about?
- You don't... What are you smoking?

686
00:57:58,482 --> 00:58:01,007
Isten, did you take something.

687
00:58:04,054 --> 00:58:07,352
- Don't laugh at me. Did you?
- Yes.

688
00:58:07,590 --> 00:58:09,090
- What did you take?
- Vicodin.

689
00:58:09,292 --> 00:58:14,560
I knew you did. You took it out
of my medicine cabinet, didn't you?

690
00:58:14,798 --> 00:58:17,790
Ellie, did you take
a Vicodin out of my...

691
00:58:18,035 --> 00:58:20,595
- You know, I had four there...
- Just loosen up.

692
00:58:20,838 --> 00:58:24,239
...that I had been saving.
That's just entitlement.

693
00:58:24,475 --> 00:58:25,975
Oh, my God!

694
00:58:27,244 --> 00:58:29,646
I think Keanu likes me.

695
00:58:31,851 --> 00:58:34,411
- You're just transparent.
- I'm sorry.

696
00:58:34,654 --> 00:58:36,348
Obvious.

697
00:58:41,827 --> 00:58:45,160
Ellie? Ellie Parker?

698
00:58:46,098 --> 00:58:48,566
Ellie, hey... Give me one minute.

699
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:50,300
- Fuck you!
- No, wait. Wait, come on.

700
00:58:50,368 --> 00:58:53,701
Et me talk to you
about this, please. No, please.

701
00:58:54,005 --> 00:58:57,065
- Rot in hell!
- Ellie, give me a minute!

702
00:58:57,308 --> 00:59:00,641
You have a callback. I've been
trying to get in touch with you.

703
00:59:00,879 --> 00:59:04,075
- Don't fuck with me.
- I'm not. It's for "Delta Breeze".

704
00:59:04,314 --> 00:59:08,148
They really wanna see you on this.
You have a really good shot.

705
00:59:08,385 --> 00:59:10,047
- Wait.
- It's on Friday.

706
00:59:11,756 --> 00:59:13,223
- Hello?
- Ellie.

707
00:59:13,224 --> 00:59:16,590
- Sam!
- Excuse me. Ellie, Friday!

708
00:59:16,827 --> 00:59:20,263
- Oh, my God, where are you?
- I have a ride home.

709
00:59:21,865 --> 00:59:23,367
Which one?

710
00:59:23,803 --> 00:59:25,931
Yeah, all right, bye.

711
00:59:26,673 --> 00:59:30,005
- Sam, wait. Slut!
- Hi, sorry. I was looking for you.

712
00:59:30,242 --> 00:59:35,942
They kicked me out. I know the guys
and they kicked me out of the place.

713
00:59:36,182 --> 00:59:38,811
This gorilla just grabbed me
and like threw me out.

714
00:59:39,052 --> 00:59:41,850
- I told him I've known them for...
- I lost you, I'm sorry.

715
00:59:42,322 --> 00:59:44,551
You okay? Can I give you
a ride home or something?

716
00:59:44,790 --> 00:59:50,558
- No. I just wanna sit here.
- Okay.

717
00:59:53,999 --> 00:59:56,263
- You wanna keep drinking?
- Yeah!

718
00:59:57,602 --> 01:00:01,436
- Wait, can you drive?
- Well, I'm too drunk to walk.

719
01:00:26,065 --> 01:00:29,297
Oh, for a muse of fire...

720
01:00:29,536 --> 01:00:33,234
that would ascend
the brightest sky of invention.

721
01:00:33,474 --> 01:00:35,601
A kingdom for a stage.

722
01:00:35,843 --> 01:00:38,505
A princess to act...

723
01:00:38,745 --> 01:00:43,409
and monarchs to behold
this welling scene.

724
01:03:21,745 --> 01:03:23,679
Slut!

725
01:04:24,608 --> 01:04:27,168
Well, look what the cat dragged in.

726
01:04:28,044 --> 01:04:29,544
What are you auditioning for?

727
01:04:29,646 --> 01:04:33,775
"Straight Shooters",
new cop show on Fox!

728
01:04:34,850 --> 01:04:36,977
I didn't get to go on that.

729
01:04:37,219 --> 01:04:40,621
Yeah, well, I don't think
you're right for it.

730
01:04:41,858 --> 01:04:43,519
What part is it?

731
01:04:43,994 --> 01:04:48,795
Jamie, ex-playmate, now cop.

732
01:04:49,032 --> 01:04:53,232
Jamie joined the APD because her
daddy was killed in the line of duty!

733
01:04:54,172 --> 01:05:00,576
Jamie's extreme beauty betrays
her will power and feline ambition!

734
01:05:00,911 --> 01:05:04,608
Men on the force soon realize she is
a force to be reckoned with...

735
01:05:04,849 --> 01:05:09,344
after she out shoots them all
in a downtown bank robbery.

736
01:05:11,757 --> 01:05:13,257
Right?

737
01:05:13,592 --> 01:05:15,149
Where's your gun?

738
01:05:16,327 --> 01:05:18,693
Fuck, I don't have a gun!

739
01:05:19,764 --> 01:05:21,823
Shit, I need a gun.

740
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:23,700
Good luck.

741
01:05:23,701 --> 01:05:26,397
I wanna hear all about last night.
Help yourself to a donut.

742
01:05:26,637 --> 01:05:28,661
I was getting in character.

743
01:05:29,839 --> 01:05:33,866
Ellie, I need you to take out
the garbage, like, even once.

744
01:05:50,496 --> 01:05:54,865
Girl, no. It's serious,
I'm not lying. He is gay.

745
01:05:55,867 --> 01:05:59,564
I know. I know it's so crazy.
Hang on.

746
01:06:00,205 --> 01:06:02,800
- Can you just tell Dennis I'm here?
- Yeah, what's your name?

747
01:06:03,176 --> 01:06:05,940
- Ellie Parker.
- Hold on. Virtual Management.

748
01:06:06,179 --> 01:06:07,679
Forget it.

749
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:09,271
Wait!

750
01:06:10,315 --> 01:06:13,375
Excuse me. Excuse me!

751
01:06:13,919 --> 01:06:17,286
Miss? Excuse me, miss,
you cannot just walk back here!

752
01:06:17,522 --> 01:06:21,925
My name is not "miss". Ellie Parker,
and you should know that by now.

753
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:23,659
Say it.

754
01:06:23,661 --> 01:06:25,356
Say my name.

755
01:06:25,663 --> 01:06:27,528
- Say it.
- Ellie Parker.

756
01:06:33,538 --> 01:06:36,029
- Hi.
- Why don't we calm down?

757
01:06:36,274 --> 01:06:40,209
Come into my office.
Sit, sit.

758
01:06:44,650 --> 01:06:46,017
What is going on with you, I mean...

759
01:06:46,018 --> 01:06:50,647
Bursting in here
like a big drama queen.

760
01:06:51,423 --> 01:06:54,325
If you were only that good
in your auditions.

761
01:06:57,831 --> 01:06:59,924
I quit.

762
01:07:01,602 --> 01:07:03,263
I quit.

763
01:07:07,173 --> 01:07:09,505
I can't do this anymore, Dennis.

764
01:07:11,477 --> 01:07:14,571
No, I honestly cannot remember...

765
01:07:14,814 --> 01:07:18,214
the reasons I wanted to become
an actress in the first place.

766
01:07:19,184 --> 01:07:23,553
I used to dream
about being an artist...

767
01:07:24,022 --> 01:07:29,484
and enlightening the human
condition, and now this is...

768
01:07:29,729 --> 01:07:33,129
It's all a... It's a big...
You know?

769
01:07:38,036 --> 01:07:42,270
Ellie, everyone on the team here...

770
01:07:42,509 --> 01:07:45,807
is trying their best
to keep you working.

771
01:07:47,213 --> 01:07:49,511
I don't think
there's any disagreement...

772
01:07:49,749 --> 01:07:54,449
of what an extraordinary
actress you are.

773
01:07:58,326 --> 01:08:00,919
People wanna hire confidence.

774
01:08:02,629 --> 01:08:06,531
You know,
when you walk in that room...

775
01:08:06,767 --> 01:08:12,137
they don't wanna know
about vulnerability or desperation.

776
01:08:12,372 --> 01:08:15,636
You know, it just makes them
uncomfortable, that's all.

777
01:08:16,342 --> 01:08:17,842
Did someone say something?

778
01:08:17,877 --> 01:08:24,147
No, I just think it's good karma
for us to talk honestly.

779
01:08:27,353 --> 01:08:32,757
I think your spirit's been broken
a little bit, and they sense that.

780
01:08:35,263 --> 01:08:38,630
It only reminds them
of their own weaknesses.

781
01:08:42,402 --> 01:08:45,098
Yeah, well, I don't give
a shit anymore.

782
01:08:46,473 --> 01:08:48,271
I don't.

783
01:08:52,313 --> 01:08:55,907
What about that "Cruel City"?
Did I get a callback on that?

784
01:08:56,984 --> 01:08:59,885
Oh, they wanted a name.

785
01:09:00,087 --> 01:09:01,588
Who?

786
01:09:02,590 --> 01:09:06,048
- Eslie Bibb.
- Who the fuck is eslie Bibb?

787
01:09:07,428 --> 01:09:08,861
Who is that?

788
01:09:08,862 --> 01:09:11,194
- You're being hostile.
- I'm bitter too!

789
01:09:11,431 --> 01:09:14,195
You said I'm a good actress.
What is so wrong with me?

790
01:09:14,434 --> 01:09:17,404
- What makes me unhirable?
- You're brilliant!

791
01:09:19,207 --> 01:09:22,039
You know what?
I want all my head shots...

792
01:09:22,242 --> 01:09:25,370
my compilation tapes,
anything else you might have of mine.

793
01:09:25,612 --> 01:09:30,074
Pack it up. I'm done, Dennis.
I'm through!

794
01:09:30,753 --> 01:09:36,122
Ellie, I really think you ought
to think about this, I mean...

795
01:09:36,357 --> 01:09:40,623
one doesn't make such a big decision
because they had a bad day.

796
01:09:40,862 --> 01:09:43,764
I thought about it a lot, actually.

797
01:09:44,366 --> 01:09:47,961
And it is the hardest decision
I ever had to make.

798
01:09:49,871 --> 01:09:52,635
Apart from have
or not have an abortion.

799
01:09:56,711 --> 01:10:00,078
Rainbow, I want you to get a box...

800
01:10:00,848 --> 01:10:07,447
and collect all of Ellie Parker's
head shots and all of her videotapes.

801
01:10:07,689 --> 01:10:13,856
Put them in the box, bring
in the box, hold my calls. Bye.

802
01:10:14,363 --> 01:10:18,628
That's it? You're not even going
to try to talk me out of it?

803
01:10:19,367 --> 01:10:22,495
Come on, Dennis,
you can try, you know? I...

804
01:10:23,004 --> 01:10:29,434
I cannot interfere in
other people's destiny. I can't.

805
01:10:45,995 --> 01:10:47,826
Are you okay?

806
01:10:49,631 --> 01:10:51,861
Vanessa left me.

807
01:10:52,101 --> 01:10:54,433
Oh, my God, Dennis!

808
01:10:57,373 --> 01:10:59,203
Sorry.

809
01:10:59,741 --> 01:11:01,241
What happened?

810
01:11:01,242 --> 01:11:05,612
Well, she caught me
fucking around on her.

811
01:11:07,549 --> 01:11:09,711
Oh, my God!

812
01:11:09,953 --> 01:11:13,319
I don't mean to laugh, I...

813
01:11:18,193 --> 01:11:20,288
I hope you're okay.

814
01:11:28,705 --> 01:11:32,642
Thank you. For trying.

815
01:11:38,249 --> 01:11:40,341
You look good.

816
01:11:44,921 --> 01:11:47,481
- Really?
- Yeah.

817
01:11:49,392 --> 01:11:51,451
Suspiciously good.

818
01:11:55,197 --> 01:11:58,030
Have you had some work done?

819
01:12:00,136 --> 01:12:01,831
- You have, haven't you?
- A tiny, tiny bit.

820
01:12:02,072 --> 01:12:07,509
Oh, my God! Oh, my God, Dennis!
Et me see!

821
01:12:08,644 --> 01:12:11,636
I'm only telling you this 'cause
you're not my client anymore!

822
01:12:20,125 --> 01:12:21,853
Good work.

823
01:12:32,471 --> 01:12:38,204
Good luck in whatever
you decide to do, Ellie Parker.

824
01:12:54,859 --> 01:12:56,656
Bye, Ellie.

825
01:14:30,189 --> 01:14:34,751
<i>Yes, this is your baby, Sebastian.</i>

826
01:14:35,328 --> 01:14:39,764
<i>You know how I know it's yours?
Because it's a cancer!</i>

827
01:14:40,465 --> 01:14:45,904
<i>It's a like a tumor growing inside
of me! I want it out of me!</i>

828
01:14:49,041 --> 01:14:52,498
<i>No, you look at me!
You look at me now!</i>

829
01:14:54,813 --> 01:14:58,979
<i>Do you understand?
Please, get away!</i>

830
01:15:05,958 --> 01:15:10,054
<i>"The Tides of Passion"
will return after these messages.</i>

831
01:15:52,204 --> 01:15:58,111
I know this is out of the blue, but
I just have been thinking about you.

832
01:15:58,980 --> 01:16:01,504
I just feel it's too long
since we've spoken.

833
01:16:01,748 --> 01:16:05,707
There's some changes going on and...
Anyway, I'm just trying to connect.

834
01:16:05,952 --> 01:16:07,453
Pick up!

835
01:16:07,655 --> 01:16:09,885
I've been really busy and...

836
01:16:10,124 --> 01:16:13,616
not been able to catch up with
any friends and now it's the time.

837
01:16:13,861 --> 01:16:17,227
I owe you so many phone calls
and I know...

838
01:16:19,232 --> 01:16:23,362
you're wondering why I'm calling,
but I really wanna speak to you.

839
01:16:23,603 --> 01:16:28,335
I want to tell you everything
that's going on and...

840
01:16:28,574 --> 01:16:30,839
see how you're doing...

841
01:16:31,078 --> 01:16:32,841
see if you're all right.

842
01:16:33,080 --> 01:16:37,484
I know some great things have
been happening to you, and I just...

843
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:42,818
I broke up with Justin and...

844
01:16:45,092 --> 01:16:50,361
Anyway, please, can you call me?
I really would like to speak to you.

845
01:16:50,599 --> 01:16:57,003
I'm really, really sorry
I haven't called. I don't know.

846
01:16:57,238 --> 01:17:00,332
Can you call me, please, Sally?

847
01:17:00,575 --> 01:17:03,670
Hi, Sally, it's me again.
I'm so sorry.

848
01:17:03,912 --> 01:17:09,178
You must think I'm a total freak.
I don't know what came over me!

849
01:17:09,417 --> 01:17:12,978
But I'm really fine.
It would be good to see you.

850
01:17:13,221 --> 01:17:17,157
I hope all is going well. I just
wanna, you know, meet the baby...

851
01:17:17,392 --> 01:17:21,954
and see how things are going.

852
01:17:22,196 --> 01:17:24,686
Wow, he must be
getting big now, uke.

853
01:17:25,565 --> 01:17:29,194
Uke or was it uce? Uce...

854
01:17:29,436 --> 01:17:35,570
I don't know if it was an old message
or something, but anyway...

855
01:17:35,811 --> 01:17:37,835
I'm returning your call.

856
01:17:57,232 --> 01:17:58,733
Fuck!

857
01:18:46,883 --> 01:18:50,148
Hi, it's Ellie. How are you?

858
01:18:50,386 --> 01:18:52,719
Ook, I was wondering
what are you doing.

859
01:18:52,957 --> 01:18:57,951
Do you... Do you have any time
lately, 'cause I'm free and...

860
01:18:58,195 --> 01:19:00,822
and if you wanted to come over.

861
01:19:02,265 --> 01:19:06,463
I... I... Yeah, sure, now?
Now now?

862
01:19:06,936 --> 01:19:08,436
Hold on.

863
01:19:10,473 --> 01:19:11,973
- Hi, how are you?
- Good, how are you?

864
01:19:12,208 --> 01:19:14,368
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you too.

865
01:19:14,610 --> 01:19:17,204
Double kiss. Hey, I'm sorry
about the other night.

866
01:19:17,446 --> 01:19:19,471
No, no, it's fine.
It's totally fine.

867
01:19:19,715 --> 01:19:21,216
- Come in. Hey, cool bag.
- Thanks.

868
01:19:21,251 --> 01:19:25,278
Yeah, it's from Guatemala. I got
it when I visited Central America.

869
01:19:25,522 --> 01:19:28,752
Really? That's interesting.
I'd love to go there.

870
01:19:28,991 --> 01:19:32,950
It's great, really incredible.
You'd love to go there.

871
01:19:33,195 --> 01:19:35,028
- Okay, come in.
- Okay.

872
01:19:35,266 --> 01:19:38,258
It's hard to explain,
but I kind of feel...

873
01:19:38,502 --> 01:19:44,498
I sort of feel like this huge
sense of relief, you know?

874
01:19:44,742 --> 01:19:47,210
I feel...

875
01:19:48,280 --> 01:19:49,780
liberated.

876
01:19:50,315 --> 01:19:54,307
But then, on the other hand,
I also feel...

877
01:19:56,554 --> 01:19:58,818
sad, you know?

878
01:19:59,990 --> 01:20:02,220
Kind of like someone died.

879
01:20:05,162 --> 01:20:10,531
I don't know what to do with myself.
I don't know how to be alone and...

880
01:20:10,767 --> 01:20:12,394
- I don't know how to be alone either.
- Really?

881
01:20:12,635 --> 01:20:16,595
Yeah, I mean... Do you have
a thing like voices in your head?

882
01:20:16,840 --> 01:20:19,809
- You mean like...?
- Not like "kill, kill, kill", like...

883
01:20:20,044 --> 01:20:23,012
Yeah, right.

884
01:20:23,246 --> 01:20:26,647
But yeah, that's why I do what
I do, that's why I love to act.

885
01:20:26,883 --> 01:20:31,822
It's a creative outlet, it's putting
it somewhere, you know?

886
01:20:33,458 --> 01:20:36,517
You wanna hear
something really weird?

887
01:20:36,760 --> 01:20:39,490
My therapist has a crush on me.

888
01:20:41,031 --> 01:20:45,868
That's kind of what's supposed to
happen a little bit, it's called...

889
01:20:46,105 --> 01:20:47,605
Transference, I know.

890
01:20:49,108 --> 01:20:53,669
But this is not that.
This is seriously awkward.

891
01:20:53,912 --> 01:20:55,573
I don't know, it's...

892
01:20:56,314 --> 01:21:01,308
I feel like she's undressing me
right there, on the couch.

893
01:21:01,553 --> 01:21:05,079
Every time I'm about to leave I walk
away thinking I'm gonna feel good...

894
01:21:05,322 --> 01:21:08,951
then she says something negative,
as if to say "Come back, love me.

895
01:21:09,193 --> 01:21:10,694
- Need me, need me, need me."
- That's what's supposed to happen.

896
01:21:10,829 --> 01:21:13,798
You kind of...

897
01:21:14,032 --> 01:21:16,000
It's a kind of controlled
mini nervous breakdown.

898
01:21:16,234 --> 01:21:20,431
I know. Do you wanna know something?
I'll let you in on something.

899
01:21:20,671 --> 01:21:25,007
Therapist, the rapist.

900
01:21:27,513 --> 01:21:29,174
- What do you mean?
- It means the same thing.

901
01:21:29,415 --> 01:21:34,147
Spell out "therapist", break it up
to 2 words: "the rapist".

902
01:21:35,220 --> 01:21:38,349
That's what it means,
that's what she's doing...

903
01:21:54,907 --> 01:21:56,932
That was weird.

904
01:21:59,344 --> 01:22:02,973
Well, I'm definitely gay.

905
01:22:04,182 --> 01:22:05,844
What?

906
01:22:07,486 --> 01:22:10,387
I wasn't totally sure until now.

907
01:22:10,623 --> 01:22:16,083
I've done stuff with guys and women
but I didn't really know.

908
01:22:16,327 --> 01:22:18,889
Thanks a lot for crystallizing it.
I appreciate it.

909
01:22:19,132 --> 01:22:21,293
Are you fucking kidding me?

910
01:22:22,002 --> 01:22:23,799
Wait, I don't...

911
01:22:24,037 --> 01:22:26,834
Sorry. I don't have anything.
We used a condom, it's...

912
01:22:27,073 --> 01:22:31,237
That's not the point.
Oh, my God. Idiot!

913
01:22:31,477 --> 01:22:33,036
Oh, my God!

914
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:36,078
- I can't believe you!
- I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

915
01:22:36,316 --> 01:22:38,113
You have to go, okay?
I can't take this.

916
01:22:38,351 --> 01:22:40,750
I didn't mean to do anything fucked
up like that. I'm really sorry.

917
01:22:40,986 --> 01:22:45,082
I don't believe this. This is not
happening. How did you...?

918
01:22:45,624 --> 01:22:49,355
- I was thinking about Johnny Depp.
- Oh, my God.

919
01:22:49,595 --> 01:22:52,588
I'm embarrassed.
I didn't know that... I didn't know.

920
01:22:52,833 --> 01:22:55,824
I can't believe it. I'm an
experiment all of a sudden, right?

921
01:22:56,335 --> 01:23:00,170
Are you 15 years-old? You should've
figured this out a long time ago!

922
01:23:00,607 --> 01:23:02,268
Who are you?

923
01:23:03,677 --> 01:23:06,510
You gotta go, okay? Just get your
fucking clothes and get out of here.

924
01:23:06,747 --> 01:23:10,238
Take your shoes
and don't forget your little purse!

925
01:23:10,783 --> 01:23:12,648
- It's not a purse, it's a bag.
- It's a purse!

926
01:23:12,885 --> 01:23:14,752
I've seen the same one in Urban
Outfitters in the women's section.

927
01:23:14,989 --> 01:23:18,652
That's the closest you'll ever going
to get to Guatemala. Go! Oh, God!

928
01:23:18,893 --> 01:23:21,292
- I'm going, I'm sorry.
- I feel violated!

929
01:23:40,113 --> 01:23:42,877
<i>You have two new messages.</i>

930
01:23:45,152 --> 01:23:46,744
<i>First new message.</i>

931
01:23:46,987 --> 01:23:50,478
<i>Hey, Ellie, it's me, Justin. Hi.</i>

932
01:23:51,423 --> 01:23:55,383
<i>I haven't been able to take a dump
since you've been gone.</i>

933
01:23:56,029 --> 01:23:59,625
<i>Roses are red
Violets are too</i>

934
01:23:59,867 --> 01:24:04,064
<i>I miss you so much
My balls are blue</i>

935
01:24:04,304 --> 01:24:09,107
<i>Message erased.
Sent today at 12:37.</i>

936
01:24:09,344 --> 01:24:12,108
<i>Ellie, this is Dennis.
Don't hang up.</i>

937
01:24:12,347 --> 01:24:15,111
<i>You got a callback
for "Delta Breeze".</i>

938
01:24:15,350 --> 01:24:18,978
<i>I'd love to drag you out of your
retirement. It'd be great to do.</i>

939
01:24:19,220 --> 01:24:22,588
<i>So give me a ring
and we'll set that up, okay?</i>

940
01:24:22,825 --> 01:24:25,089
<i>Take care. Bye-bye.</i>

941
01:24:25,727 --> 01:24:27,592
<i>Message saved.</i>

942
01:24:50,484 --> 01:24:54,215
Sitting on that front porch,
I stared at your eyes for hours.

943
01:25:22,185 --> 01:25:27,121
That terrible night,
the storm ripped and...

944
01:25:32,828 --> 01:25:34,887
Yeah, momma.

945
01:25:53,748 --> 01:25:55,375
Fuck.

946
01:26:10,967 --> 01:26:12,663
Nice dress.

947
01:26:16,173 --> 01:26:20,609
Ellie, hi. I'm so glad that
you're here. You look great.

948
01:26:20,843 --> 01:26:24,609
- You don't think it's too much?
- No, it's perfect. Et me tell you:

949
01:26:24,847 --> 01:26:30,808
It's intense in there. It's been a
sort of a nightmarish movie so far.

950
01:26:31,054 --> 01:26:33,521
I just wanted you to know before
you go in so you can be prepared.

951
01:26:33,755 --> 01:26:35,746
- But you look beautiful.
- Thank you.

952
01:26:35,991 --> 01:26:37,491
Really, really.

953
01:26:37,526 --> 01:26:39,084
Everyone, this is Ellie Parker.

954
01:26:41,097 --> 01:26:42,655
Smash, you remember Ellie?

955
01:26:42,899 --> 01:26:46,391
So nice to see you again.
These are the new producers.

956
01:26:47,235 --> 01:26:48,862
What happened
to the other producers?

957
01:26:49,104 --> 01:26:52,301
We are paying for this movie now.

958
01:26:53,508 --> 01:26:56,570
We fired those
plastic Hollywood idiots.

959
01:26:57,748 --> 01:27:01,444
Fucking idiots. Plastic.

960
01:27:01,684 --> 01:27:04,778
- We are making a real movie.
- Oh, cool.

961
01:27:05,021 --> 01:27:06,886
Art.

962
01:27:07,591 --> 01:27:09,719
Not shit art.

963
01:27:14,199 --> 01:27:17,395
There's too much light in here.

964
01:27:27,511 --> 01:27:29,705
Do you have the new scene?

965
01:27:29,946 --> 01:27:31,607
New scene?

966
01:27:32,682 --> 01:27:34,182
Fucking cunt.

967
01:27:35,285 --> 01:27:37,378
Is that a wedding dress?

968
01:27:37,621 --> 01:27:39,885
Are you getting married?

969
01:27:41,692 --> 01:27:45,183
Marriage is for beasts!

970
01:27:51,803 --> 01:27:53,896
- Ook, what new scene? I didn't...
- Very simple, a few lines.

971
01:27:54,139 --> 01:27:59,838
They encapsulate
the entire meaning of love.

972
01:28:00,077 --> 01:28:02,409
Sorry to spring this on you, Ellie.
If you wanna take a minute...

973
01:28:02,914 --> 01:28:07,317
We just wanna see your mouth move.

974
01:28:08,353 --> 01:28:11,116
Eugene's gonna be reading
this with you. Eugene.

975
01:28:14,859 --> 01:28:16,759
Have a seat, right?

976
01:28:20,131 --> 01:28:23,157
Where's the lines? Who has a light?

977
01:28:32,610 --> 01:28:34,441
Far be it from me to air my...

978
01:28:34,679 --> 01:28:36,579
Stop, stop.

979
01:28:44,290 --> 01:28:46,588
- There.
- Very nice. Very nice.

980
01:28:46,826 --> 01:28:48,453
Much better.

981
01:29:00,106 --> 01:29:03,132
Far be it from me to air
my opinion, Mr. O'Malley...

982
01:29:03,375 --> 01:29:08,073
but I believe in a single God...

983
01:29:08,313 --> 01:29:10,838
and a single nation.

984
01:29:11,082 --> 01:29:14,779
Not two Americas.

985
01:29:15,753 --> 01:29:18,881
This is worth fighting for!

986
01:29:25,798 --> 01:29:32,100
You're a lady of mighty fine opinions
and a beautiful woman too.

987
01:29:33,938 --> 01:29:36,236
Why, Mr. O'Malley...

988
01:29:36,474 --> 01:29:42,540
it's getting kind of late to be
out without a chaperone.

989
01:29:46,986 --> 01:29:50,786
I can see the butterflies!

990
01:29:51,023 --> 01:29:52,958
So pretty.

991
01:29:54,728 --> 01:29:56,423
We should head back.

992
01:29:59,965 --> 01:30:05,631
Although I love the swamp at dusk.

993
01:30:10,876 --> 01:30:14,038
I miss my husband.

994
01:30:14,279 --> 01:30:16,577
Well, then allow me to comfort you.

995
01:30:19,918 --> 01:30:24,789
Oh, Mr. O'Malley.

996
01:30:26,660 --> 01:30:30,390
- That was great. Totally great.
- Great.

997
01:30:39,073 --> 01:30:40,937
That was perfect, Ellie.

998
01:30:41,942 --> 01:30:44,206
Do you know the meaning of love?

999
01:30:46,179 --> 01:30:47,680
Ove is shit.

1000
01:30:50,551 --> 01:30:54,385
Do you guys want her
to do this again? One more time?

1001
01:30:54,621 --> 01:30:58,523
Do you guys want her to do this
again? Should we do another...

1002
01:31:00,860 --> 01:31:04,421
Come on, Ellie. That was great.

1003
01:31:04,664 --> 01:31:07,064
Have fun in Los Angeles.

1004
01:31:10,069 --> 01:31:11,730
I am so sorry.

1005
01:31:11,971 --> 01:31:16,875
That was really, really good. They're
really weird and kind of intense.

1006
01:31:17,110 --> 01:31:19,169
- Whatever.
- Can I talk to you for a second?

1007
01:31:19,412 --> 01:31:23,211
- I need to have some words with you.
- I wanna apologize. I'll be right in.

1008
01:31:23,449 --> 01:31:25,042
- Goodbye, Nellie.
- Ellie.

1009
01:31:26,186 --> 01:31:27,386
Goodbye.

1010
01:31:27,387 --> 01:31:32,691
I wanna take you to dinner and talk
about Justin. I am so sorry, Ellie.

1011
01:31:32,928 --> 01:31:34,828
I'm sorry.

1012
01:31:56,450 --> 01:31:58,247
Fuck!
