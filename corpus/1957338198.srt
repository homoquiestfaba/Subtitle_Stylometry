[male officer] Are you alone
in the house, sir?

Not yet.</i>

Possible puncture
to the duodenum.

17
00:01:19,352 --> 00:01:24,024
Mr. Myers, are you on
any medications presently?

18
00:01:24,156 --> 00:01:25,692
Mr. Myers?

19
00:01:26,459 --> 00:01:28,295
Why would you do this?

20
00:01:28,429 --> 00:01:31,432
[man] <i>The things I've done.</i>

21
00:01:31,566 --> 00:01:33,633

for forgiveness?</i>

28

[chuckles] <i>No.</i>

29
00:02:15,942 --> 00:02:19,212
<i>But I know I want someone
to stay with me.</i>

30
00:02:20,913 --> 00:02:23,984
<i>Lie to me
that it will be all right.</i>

31
00:02:27,354 --> 00:02:28,989
Ah!

32
00:02:29,122 --> 00:02:33,961
Aw, you didn't even
touch your breakfast. Nan!

33
00:02:35,329 --> 00:02:36,831
Beauty?

34
00:02:39,699 --> 00:02:41,835

[doorbell rings]

41
00:03:10,229 --> 00:03:11,899
Just a minute.

42
00:03:13,099 --> 00:03:17,337
<i>But I wanted a lot
that never came true.</i>

43
00:03:17,471 --> 00:03:23,277
<i>And I've done things
I never wanted to do.</i>

00:03:24,377 --> 00:03:25,779
[sighs]

45
00:03:31,117 --> 00:03:32,353
<i>Los siento.</i>

46
00:03:32,885 --> 00:03:36,590
Wait. Wait! Hey!

[Ben] <i>Everybody chooses.</i>

48
00:03:40,561 --> 00:03:42,629
<i>But is it too late?</i>

49
00:03:44,931 --> 00:03:46,065
<i>For any of us?</i>

50
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:50,036
I gotta go in to meet Nicky
at the bar.

51
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:52,938
<i>My daughter, Nickel,
the homicide detective.</i>

52
00:03:53,073 --> 00:03:57,712
<i>She became a cop
to catch me.</i>

53
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,884
<i>Or her sister, Sherry,
who had no father,</i>

54
00:04:04,016 --> 00:04:06,418
<i>and even
less of a chance.</i>

55
00:04:07,486 --> 00:04:11,490
Sweetie, eh... I haven't
been in for three weeks.

56
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:13,659
You never know
with Tommy.

57
00:04:13,794 --> 00:04:17,831
Okay. That new girl,
she didn't work out.

58
00:04:17,963 --> 00:04:21,634
So, uh,
I won't be gone long.

59
00:04:21,767 --> 00:04:24,671
Just don't let
anybody in.

60
00:04:29,543 --> 00:04:31,411
I'd be happy to.

61
00:04:32,045 --> 00:04:34,882
<i>And my beauty, Nan...</i>

62
00:04:37,016 --> 00:04:40,855
<i>who left me
without going anywhere.</i>

63
00:04:45,059 --> 00:04:47,628
[sobs]

64
00:04:47,762 --> 00:04:51,564
- Nan? Nan, what is it?
- [urine trickles]

65
00:04:51,697 --> 00:04:53,933
[cries]

66
00:04:57,237 --> 00:05:01,242
It's okay. It's okay.

67
00:05:04,511 --> 00:05:05,746
It's okay.

68
00:05:07,747 --> 00:05:10,417
[sniffles]

00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:13,086
[shower running]

70
00:05:15,288 --> 00:05:18,425
[strains] All right,
beautiful girl.

71
00:05:29,468 --> 00:05:32,173
[keys jangling]

72
00:06:07,173 --> 00:06:10,477
[steering fluid leaking]

73
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:33,566
[Ben] <i>I went legit
12 years ago,</i>

74
00:06:33,701 --> 00:06:39,004
<i>thanks to a congressman
who owed me a favor.</i>

75
00:06:39,139 --> 00:06:41,841
<i>And now,
my daughter, Nicky,</i>

76
00:06:41,975 --> 00:06:44,978
<i>practically works
for that congressman</i>

77
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:47,947
<i>as his police liaison.</i>

78
00:06:48,081 --> 00:06:49,716
[clears throat]

79
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:52,386
<i>She and I are not close.</i>

80
00:06:55,588 --> 00:06:57,524
Hey, Ben!

81
00:06:57,658 --> 00:07:00,227
You okay?
You doing all right?

82
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,161
You really wanted to know
the answer to that,

83
00:07:02,295 --> 00:07:03,896
you'd have come sooner.

84
00:07:04,031 --> 00:07:06,098
I'm sorry,
the congressman's scrambling

85
00:07:06,233 --> 00:07:08,869
since we lost the
redistricting. We have a...

86
00:07:09,002 --> 00:07:12,338
We have a major campaign
relaunch this evening,

87
00:07:12,471 --> 00:07:14,073
so my plate
has been pretty full.

88
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:18,011
Have you, uh, acquainted
your Representative Billings

89
00:07:18,144 --> 00:07:20,680
with his new constituency?

90
00:07:21,648 --> 00:07:24,084
I mean the people
he's been calling wetbacks

91
00:07:24,218 --> 00:07:26,086
for the last few years.

92
00:07:28,487 --> 00:07:29,923
Tricky, I know.

93
00:07:30,055 --> 00:07:32,324
I know
that representative...

94
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:37,164
constituent relation
better than anybody.

95
00:07:38,232 --> 00:07:40,201
Yeah, it's tricky.

96
00:07:40,334 --> 00:07:42,401
That's why it was hard
for me to get away,

97
00:07:42,535 --> 00:07:45,272
and that's why I'm gonna have
to go pretty soon,

98
00:07:45,404 --> 00:07:48,341
but I need to talk to you about something.
It's very important.

99
00:07:49,175 --> 00:07:51,512
[Ben] <i>Not very close.</i>

100
00:07:56,783 --> 00:08:00,287
[slow music playing]

101
00:08:03,589 --> 00:08:05,758
I need to talk to you
about your grandsons.

102
00:08:05,891 --> 00:08:09,663
I don't have grandsons, Nicky.
You know that better than anybody.

103
00:08:09,797 --> 00:08:11,831
Uh, can I get you
some coffee?

104
00:08:11,964 --> 00:08:15,435
No thanks. I need
to talk to you. [sighs]

105
00:08:15,569 --> 00:08:19,572
Sherry. It's about Sherry,
your daughter.

106
00:08:19,706 --> 00:08:22,075
She is not my kid, Nick.

107
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:24,778
She's been at St. Vinny's
for two months,

108
00:08:24,911 --> 00:08:27,280
and now they just
put her in hospice.

109
00:08:27,413 --> 00:08:29,216
I don't know
if you knew that.

110
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:30,984
The heroin.

111
00:08:31,785 --> 00:08:34,355
She's gonna die.
And, Dad...

112
00:08:35,488 --> 00:08:38,158
Sherry's boys
are such good boys.

113
00:08:39,091 --> 00:08:40,961
But they're not
very verbal.

114
00:08:41,094 --> 00:08:43,864
I think there's a way
that we could help them.

115
00:08:43,996 --> 00:08:45,966
There's this special school,

116
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:50,537
and Sherry has named you if...
when she, you know,

117
00:08:50,671 --> 00:08:53,474
and all you need to do is sign once.
I will take care of...

118
00:08:53,606 --> 00:08:55,308
What are you doing?

119
00:08:55,442 --> 00:08:57,411
Something I should have done
a long time ago

120
00:08:57,543 --> 00:08:59,478
when you came to me
for college.

121
00:08:59,611 --> 00:09:04,850
Uh, that's... that's $20,000
in cash. No taxes.

122
00:09:04,984 --> 00:09:06,320
This is for me?

123
00:09:07,086 --> 00:09:09,255
- Dad, that was 20 years ago.
- Well...

124
00:09:09,389 --> 00:09:11,692
I don't... I don't need
that money anymore.

125
00:09:11,825 --> 00:09:14,194
This is not
"No, thank you" money.

126
00:09:14,327 --> 00:09:17,230
[huffs] You can give
the money to Sherry.

127
00:09:17,364 --> 00:09:19,399
Okay, listen.
What's going on here?

128
00:09:19,533 --> 00:09:23,802
Wha... What's the angle?
What do you want?

129
00:09:23,937 --> 00:09:25,738
There has to be a want?

130
00:09:25,871 --> 00:09:28,141
Always with you. Always.

131
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,981
[clears throat]

132
00:09:37,417 --> 00:09:39,452
- I have cancer...
- What?

133
00:09:39,586 --> 00:09:41,621
Leukemia.

134
00:09:41,754 --> 00:09:43,456
- And...
- Wait! Wait! No.

135
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:45,459
- And it's bad.
- Are you kidding me?

136
00:09:45,591 --> 00:09:47,026
I... Are you...

137
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,361
It almost feels
like a relief.

138
00:09:49,495 --> 00:09:53,667
You know, I-I-I tried
to hire this maid today,

139
00:09:53,799 --> 00:09:56,502
and she took one look and
turned around and walked out.

140
00:09:56,635 --> 00:09:58,738
And that's kind of the essence
of my problem.

141
00:09:58,871 --> 00:10:03,176
I need someone
who's going to help me with Nan.

142
00:10:05,077 --> 00:10:06,746
Oh, God.

143
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:08,481
You always
had the worst timing.

144
00:10:08,615 --> 00:10:12,519
[scoffs] I wouldn't
ask this of you, unless...

145
00:10:13,854 --> 00:10:16,022
Unless I had no choice.

146
00:10:17,322 --> 00:10:22,763
[sighs] I gotta know that there's
gonna be somebody to help with Nan.

147
00:10:24,998 --> 00:10:26,400
Dad?

148
00:10:27,167 --> 00:10:28,701
What about the boys?

149
00:10:28,835 --> 00:10:31,004
- Can't you care about them, too?
- You won't understand...

150
00:10:31,138 --> 00:10:33,840
You'd just sign one time,
and you'd give those boys a chance.

151
00:10:33,974 --> 00:10:37,410
Ah, you were just a kid.
Look, uh...

152
00:10:37,543 --> 00:10:41,280
When I went away,
your mother

153
00:10:41,413 --> 00:10:45,085
wouldn't have anything to do
with, and I mean nothing,

154
00:10:45,217 --> 00:10:47,753
nothing to do with me.

155
00:10:48,455 --> 00:10:52,158
Nobody understood
except Nan.

156
00:10:53,158 --> 00:10:54,760
Because you chose her.

157
00:10:54,894 --> 00:10:56,230
Well, a man... [laughs]

158
00:10:56,363 --> 00:11:00,600
A man lives
and he makes choices. Yes!

159
00:11:00,732 --> 00:11:02,268
And she's my wife.

160
00:11:02,402 --> 00:11:05,572
And I would... What? What?
What are you doing here?

161
00:11:05,705 --> 00:11:07,706
Well, I've been
coming in early...

162
00:11:07,841 --> 00:11:09,576
I told you to stay late!

163
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:13,079
- I'm making sure we're okay...
- I-I left a message.

164
00:11:13,212 --> 00:11:15,414
I-I didn't know.
I'll get out.

165
00:11:15,548 --> 00:11:17,884
No, it's okay, Tommy.
It's fine.

166
00:11:18,017 --> 00:11:20,120
I-I'm gonna go anyway.

167
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:24,524
[sighs] Look...

168
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:29,495
I'll help you, Dad.
I'll help you with Nan.

169
00:11:29,629 --> 00:11:31,365
It's fine. I'll do it.

170
00:11:33,799 --> 00:11:35,334
[sniffles]

171
00:11:35,467 --> 00:11:37,370
And there's more.

172
00:11:38,238 --> 00:11:39,872
I'm not taking that.

173
00:11:40,005 --> 00:11:45,278
This is why I'm helping Nan,
because I care about her.

174
00:11:45,412 --> 00:11:48,381
But this
would never be enough.

175
00:11:48,514 --> 00:11:51,049
I know it's not enough.
I'm not saying it's enough.

176
00:11:51,183 --> 00:11:52,751
I'm not doing that!

177
00:11:52,884 --> 00:11:54,854
I am not... I am not...

178
00:11:54,988 --> 00:11:57,291
You... Goddamn it!

179
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:01,094
I was... I been coming in
early to make sure that...

180
00:12:01,227 --> 00:12:02,295
[groans]

181
00:12:02,428 --> 00:12:04,496
I'm sorry, um...

182
00:12:04,629 --> 00:12:07,266
Where did you
leave me a message?

183
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:09,802
It doesn't really matter
now, does it?

184
00:12:16,076 --> 00:12:19,211
Jo, he did not
sign the papers.

185
00:12:19,346 --> 00:12:21,214
He did not
sign the papers.

186
00:12:21,347 --> 00:12:23,348
Because, because
he told me he was sick,

187
00:12:23,482 --> 00:12:26,385
and then he tried to buy me,
and I just got too mad.

188
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:28,788
I couldn't do it.
I'm sorry.

189
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:32,859
- [engine starts]
- Hold on.

190
00:12:32,991 --> 00:12:37,296
Yeah, I don't know.
Yes, he's a son of a bitch.

191
00:12:37,429 --> 00:12:41,300
I'm a freakin' idiot...

192
00:12:42,301 --> 00:12:44,171
for even trying this.

193
00:12:45,804 --> 00:12:50,610
Now? I don't know, Sherry's
just gonna have to do it.

194
00:12:51,244 --> 00:12:52,879
She just has to.

195
00:12:54,313 --> 00:12:57,683
I'll do my best. Love you.

196
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,529
[door opens]

197
00:13:11,597 --> 00:13:14,767
Hi, Sher. How you doing?

198
00:13:23,543 --> 00:13:25,144
You don't look good.

199
00:13:25,278 --> 00:13:28,914
Well, fortunately, you look
good enough for the both of us.

200
00:13:29,682 --> 00:13:32,152
How's the boys? Miss 'em.

201
00:13:32,284 --> 00:13:34,687
My boys are great,
thank you.

202
00:13:34,821 --> 00:13:36,990
And how are you doing?
How, how are they treating you here?

203
00:13:37,123 --> 00:13:40,594
Church fosters are bringing
'em over to see me today.

204
00:13:40,726 --> 00:13:42,427
My boys love me.

205
00:13:42,928 --> 00:13:44,329
Of course they do.

206
00:13:44,998 --> 00:13:47,301
You said
I was a bad mom.

207
00:13:48,067 --> 00:13:51,471
You... you took them.

208
00:13:51,605 --> 00:13:53,072
I only took 'em
'cause you were sick

209
00:13:53,206 --> 00:13:55,108
and you couldn't take care
of them for a little while.

210
00:13:55,241 --> 00:13:58,177
You took my boys
from me.

211
00:13:58,311 --> 00:14:00,513
- No, sweetheart, I love them too.
- You t...

212
00:14:00,645 --> 00:14:03,250
I love them too, as...
Okay.

213
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:06,586
- Nick...
- Okay, Sherry. Okay.

214
00:14:11,923 --> 00:14:13,593
Who's your friend?

215
00:14:14,427 --> 00:14:15,595
It's Matilda.

216
00:14:15,727 --> 00:14:18,530
That's the best name, ever.

217
00:14:18,664 --> 00:14:21,500
You always had a way of coming
up with the best things.

218
00:14:21,634 --> 00:14:24,202
[coos]

219
00:14:24,336 --> 00:14:26,673
Like you could take
the, the worst things,

220
00:14:26,806 --> 00:14:31,610
the really, really bad stuff
and somehow make it funny even.

221
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:34,280
I always admired that
about you, Sherry.

222
00:14:34,413 --> 00:14:36,750
- No.
- Yeah.

223
00:14:36,883 --> 00:14:40,487
It's like your job was to make
the bad things not so bad.

224
00:14:41,988 --> 00:14:46,260
And my job was to try and stop
the bad things from happening.

225
00:14:47,927 --> 00:14:50,463
You're a good
big sister, Nick.

226
00:14:50,596 --> 00:14:54,667
No. A good big sister
would have protected you.

227
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:57,603
And-and-and not left you
with Mom.

228
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:00,473
I would have gotten you
to school.

229
00:15:03,109 --> 00:15:06,546
But, Sherry, that's what I
want to do for the boys now.

230
00:15:06,678 --> 00:15:09,314
I want to give them the chance
that you never had.

231
00:15:09,448 --> 00:15:12,852
Well, the church
is looking after 'em now.

232
00:15:13,419 --> 00:15:15,387
God is with them.

233
00:15:15,522 --> 00:15:19,057
Yes, and God will look
after the boys

234
00:15:19,192 --> 00:15:22,427
in this amazing
church school

235
00:15:22,562 --> 00:15:25,831
that I found for them
for special needs kids.

236
00:15:25,965 --> 00:15:29,636
And they can get all the
attention and education.

237
00:15:30,369 --> 00:15:32,038
- Okay?
- [sobs]

238
00:15:32,171 --> 00:15:36,576
So they can be big strong boys
and make their mama proud.

239
00:15:37,744 --> 00:15:40,447
Does that sound like
a good idea for you? Yeah?

240
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,315
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

241
00:15:42,447 --> 00:15:43,850
All right.

242
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:47,354
I love you, my darling girl.
I love you.

243
00:15:49,355 --> 00:15:51,524
I'll take care
of everything, okay?

244
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:53,460
Mmm.

00:17:26,352 --> 00:17:27,621
Nan.

Okay, okay.

256
00:17:37,329 --> 00:17:38,831
What happened?

257
00:17:41,134 --> 00:17:42,601
Who...

258
00:17:42,734 --> 00:17:46,538
They took everything.
They took my whole...

[breathing heavily]

260
00:17:51,243 --> 00:17:53,446
How could you
let them in?

261
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,616
Ah, Nan...

262
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,719
Oh, why did you
let 'em in?

263
00:17:59,852 --> 00:18:01,021
Nan!

Oh, Nan.

- No!
- Na...

- [knocking continues]
- [female officer] Mr. Myers, Savannah PD, please open up.

289
00:20:13,085 --> 00:20:16,690
[grunts] Just a minute,
Officer.

290
00:20:17,957 --> 00:20:21,261
[Ben] <i>And I couldn't
find them behind bars.</i>

you to open the door.

[Ben] <i>I decided to do
what I do.</i>

Sir, we need you
to open the door, now.

294
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,675
What's the problem, Officer?

295
00:20:36,809 --> 00:20:40,111
We received a report of shots
fired at this address.

296
00:20:40,246 --> 00:20:44,684
I didn't hear any gunfire,
and I didn't call any cops.

297
00:20:44,817 --> 00:20:48,119
There's been a mistake.
I'm Ben Myers.

298
00:20:48,253 --> 00:20:50,388
I'm the owner
of this property.

299
00:20:51,423 --> 00:20:53,326
- Are you alone in the house, sir?
- [police radio chatter]

300
00:20:53,459 --> 00:20:55,394
Except for you.

301
00:20:55,527 --> 00:20:57,462
I was gonna lie down.

302
00:20:57,596 --> 00:21:00,199
I didn't call any cops,
and I didn't hear any shots.

303
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:02,101
I know you didn't
call the cops.

304
00:21:02,233 --> 00:21:04,169
I know you didn't report the shots.
It was your neighbor.

305
00:21:04,303 --> 00:21:06,573
Would you mind stepping
out here and talking to us?

306
00:21:06,705 --> 00:21:08,573
Why? I can hear you fine.

307
00:21:08,708 --> 00:21:12,678
Why don't you go over to her house?
She may have a gun.

308
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:17,916
I'm gonna take a nap, and while I
am, you're not allowed in.

00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,853
Is your wife inside, sir?

[Ben] Yeah, we're fine.

00:21:29,361 --> 00:21:31,464
Get off my lawn.

313
00:21:31,596 --> 00:21:32,865
[officer]
We need to see inside.

[Ben] <i>Looking around corners

<i>I missed what was
right in front of my face.</i>

00:21:37,737 --> 00:21:39,806
You got a warrant?

317
00:21:39,939 --> 00:21:43,143
Until you do, you're not
allowed in here.

318
00:21:44,309 --> 00:21:46,010
[female officer]
Your license, sir?

319
00:21:46,144 --> 00:21:48,781
[Ben]
Slide it under the door.

320
00:21:49,914 --> 00:21:53,420
Ah, I can fix this.

321
00:21:56,756 --> 00:21:59,726
[man]
It goes... here.

322
00:21:59,858 --> 00:22:03,128
There, now I think
if you roll down this thing...

323
00:22:03,261 --> 00:22:05,498
No, no, no. Don't touch that!
Hey! Hey!

324
00:22:05,632 --> 00:22:07,901
- What the hell's the matter with you?
- I did... I'm gonna...

325
00:22:08,034 --> 00:22:10,169
- Get out of here!
- All right. I'm just trying to help.

326
00:22:10,301 --> 00:22:13,005
- I don't need your help, Mr. Fix-It.
- Okay.

327
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,542
Hey, you need
anything else?

- No. Yes!
- Huh?

I need a phone number

347
00:23:50,736 --> 00:23:54,440
[Ben sighs]
You must be Reggie.

348
00:23:55,773 --> 00:23:57,109
[shutter clicks]

349
00:23:58,377 --> 00:24:01,913
<i>Mr. Ben, your husband.
He-he can call the gas comp...</i>

350
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:06,920
- [mouse clicks]
- [Ben] And who are you?

351
00:24:09,355 --> 00:24:11,423
[shutter clicks]

352
00:24:13,692 --> 00:24:16,095
[Jimmy] <i>...call the gas company
if he has any concerns.</i>

353
00:24:16,229 --> 00:24:19,032
<i>And, uh, we're gonna
need this too, ma'am.</i>

354
00:24:20,031 --> 00:24:21,867
- <i>But...</i>
- <i>For our files.</i>

355
00:24:28,339 --> 00:24:30,175
[Jimmy] <i>You're gonna be okay,
Mrs. Myers.</i>

356
00:24:30,308 --> 00:24:33,011
<i>We found all the leaks.
All right?</i>

357
00:24:35,213 --> 00:24:37,383
<i>You have a good...
good morning.</i>

358
00:25:08,013 --> 00:25:09,448
[Tommy] Ben?

359
00:25:20,224 --> 00:25:23,495
Boss, I am really sorry.
I have looked everywhere.

360
00:25:24,195 --> 00:25:26,632
Jackson-Polk Surveying...

361
00:25:28,165 --> 00:25:29,969
It doesn't exist.

362
00:25:32,738 --> 00:25:35,908
[laughs]

363
00:25:36,041 --> 00:25:37,976
Good, good.

364
00:25:40,378 --> 00:25:43,314
Give me the flip phone.
I've gotta make a call to Ray.

365
00:25:43,449 --> 00:25:44,550
Yeah?

366
00:25:46,286 --> 00:25:47,352
Yeah.

367
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:51,390
I'm looking for a...
a white cargo van,

368
00:25:51,523 --> 00:25:53,525
that's leaking
steering fluid.

369
00:25:57,529 --> 00:25:58,564
Okay.

370
00:26:04,069 --> 00:26:08,674
[campaign workers chattering]

371
00:26:15,047 --> 00:26:16,414
[woman] Nick! Nick!

372
00:26:16,548 --> 00:26:18,951
- Hey, Mrs. Billings.
- I'm glad you're here.

373
00:26:19,084 --> 00:26:21,453
There's a problem
with the rally.

374
00:26:21,586 --> 00:26:23,355
When I arranged
for the permits,

375
00:26:23,489 --> 00:26:25,656
the Savannah Mayor's Office,
they issued them,

376
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:27,759
- but they wouldn't close the streets.
- Oh, no.

377
00:26:27,894 --> 00:26:31,296
Well, I didn't think
it was a big thing, but...

378
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:35,801
They don't think we'll have enough
people to warrant disrupting the commute.

379
00:26:35,934 --> 00:26:38,671
Okay. Let me make a few calls.
I'll fix this.

380
00:26:38,804 --> 00:26:41,173
It's a safety issue,
I'll fix it, I'll fix it.

381
00:26:41,307 --> 00:26:45,176
Okay, thank you. I knew you
would help. You always do.

382
00:26:45,309 --> 00:26:48,213
- Of course, ma'am. I'll see you later.
- Okay.

383
00:26:49,381 --> 00:26:50,716
Well, thank you,
Mr. Speaker.

384
00:26:50,849 --> 00:26:53,184
Sir, we did not expect
to be in this situation

385
00:26:53,317 --> 00:26:55,454
- so close to the election.
- [snapping fingers]

386
00:26:55,587 --> 00:26:57,855
Uh-huh. Um...

387
00:26:57,990 --> 00:26:59,992
Uh... What?

388
00:27:00,858 --> 00:27:02,227
You will?

389
00:27:02,827 --> 00:27:04,297
This weekend?

390
00:27:04,997 --> 00:27:07,766
Sir, that is...
That is a lifesaver.

391
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:10,302
I'm gonna make you feel good
about this decision, Paul.

392
00:27:10,435 --> 00:27:12,770
When we win, you're
gonna feel great.

393
00:27:12,904 --> 00:27:15,208
Thank you so much, sir.
Okay.

394
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:16,875
All right, goodbye,
Mr. Speaker.

395
00:27:17,009 --> 00:27:18,977
Yes, bye-bye.

396
00:27:19,111 --> 00:27:20,546
- [exhales]
- Good news, sir?

397
00:27:20,679 --> 00:27:24,083
Oh, that is
excellent news, Nick.

398
00:27:24,215 --> 00:27:26,017
I'm happy for you,
Congressman.

399
00:27:26,152 --> 00:27:29,721
Oh! So...
How you doing?

400
00:27:30,355 --> 00:27:32,057
I'm good, sir.

401
00:27:32,191 --> 00:27:34,927
Well, you... seem
a little distracted.

402
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:39,264
I just, I just, uh, had some,
you know, news about my dad.

403
00:27:39,397 --> 00:27:41,634
I'm a little worried
about him. That's all.

404
00:27:41,767 --> 00:27:42,802
Ben Myers?

405
00:27:44,202 --> 00:27:46,038
You know who my dad is?

406
00:27:48,074 --> 00:27:50,343
And you hired me anyway?

407
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:55,080
Did I ever tell you
my dad drank?

408
00:27:57,650 --> 00:28:00,886
He fell into a vat
of pet food

409
00:28:01,019 --> 00:28:03,655
in a plant on the I-15.

410
00:28:05,223 --> 00:28:06,991
Oh, my God. Did he die?

411
00:28:07,125 --> 00:28:09,427
[chuckles] Yeah, he did.

412
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,930
- I'm so sorry.
- The point is,

413
00:28:12,064 --> 00:28:14,432
you can't
pick your parents.

414
00:28:14,567 --> 00:28:17,102
Can't choose
where you come from.

415
00:28:17,236 --> 00:28:21,340
The only thing you get to
decide is where you're going,

416
00:28:21,473 --> 00:28:24,675
- And who you're going with.
- [cell phone beeps]

417
00:28:24,809 --> 00:28:27,879
Oh, sir, uh, shots fired. I'm sorry.
I have... I have to go.

418
00:28:28,012 --> 00:28:30,182
Sure, of course, yes.
Yeah, yeah.

419
00:28:30,316 --> 00:28:32,116
So, Nick, just one thing.
Nick, just one thing.

420
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:33,552
I need you
on my six, okay?

421
00:28:33,685 --> 00:28:37,522
<i>Esta noche,</i> I need you on my six.
Okay?

422
00:28:37,655 --> 00:28:39,325
Sir, you got it
a hundred percent.

423
00:28:39,458 --> 00:28:41,560
It's going to go really, really well.
I promise.

424
00:28:41,693 --> 00:28:43,662
- I have your back, okay?
- Great.

425
00:28:43,796 --> 00:28:47,900
And, Nick, no matter what, you come
to me or count on me for your dad.

426
00:28:48,032 --> 00:28:50,535
I appreciate that, sir.
Thank you.

427
00:28:55,141 --> 00:28:58,244
Dad, I heard a disturbance
was reported over at your house.

428
00:28:58,376 --> 00:29:00,044
Are you okay? Is Nan okay?

429
00:29:00,179 --> 00:29:01,713
[Ben] <i>How did you hear
about that?</i>

430
00:29:01,846 --> 00:29:04,048
I-I-I put a sticker
on your file. Family.

431
00:29:04,182 --> 00:29:05,817
The lieutenant
over at your precinct

432
00:29:05,951 --> 00:29:08,253
- <i>gave me a courtesy call. What's going on?</i>
- [knocking]

433
00:29:08,386 --> 00:29:10,788
Nicky, I'm gonna have
to call you back.

434
00:29:10,923 --> 00:29:12,692
Dad, is Nan okay?

435
00:29:16,528 --> 00:29:17,696
[sighs]

436
00:29:26,971 --> 00:29:29,708
- Tommy?
- Yeah, Ben.

437
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:34,346
What are you doing with me?
I mean, still with me?

438
00:29:35,013 --> 00:29:36,281
[laughs]

439
00:29:38,217 --> 00:29:43,890
'Cause I, um...
owe you my life, Ben.

440
00:29:45,757 --> 00:29:48,461
[chuckling]
That was a long time ago.

441
00:29:54,567 --> 00:29:59,538
Boss, I-I know
that you got some bad news.

442
00:30:02,974 --> 00:30:04,376
Whatever you need...

443
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:07,913
That's why I'm here.

444
00:30:09,615 --> 00:30:14,220
No questions, just
'cause you... owe me?

445
00:30:14,353 --> 00:30:18,490
No, you're not the only guy
who chooses, Ben.

446
00:30:20,425 --> 00:30:22,627
I'm here because I'm here.

447
00:30:31,336 --> 00:30:33,338
- [scoffs]
- [door opens]

448
00:30:34,673 --> 00:30:36,342
- [door closes]
- [grunts]

449
00:30:37,209 --> 00:30:39,211
[cell phone beeps]

450
00:30:39,811 --> 00:30:42,680
It's me. Yeah.

451
00:30:42,815 --> 00:30:44,283
I need an answer.

452
00:30:44,416 --> 00:30:47,819
And I'm willing to pay
extra for right now.

453
00:30:48,686 --> 00:30:49,921
By noon.

454
00:30:52,959 --> 00:30:57,629
A white cargo panel truck
that's leaking steering fluid.

455
00:30:57,762 --> 00:31:00,932
They-they must have
borrowed it from some,

456
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:03,602
some rental lot or,
you know,

457
00:31:03,736 --> 00:31:06,172
mechanics that have
some kind of...

458
00:31:06,305 --> 00:31:08,673
understanding management.

459
00:31:08,807 --> 00:31:12,377
And it's gonna come back
some time today.

460
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:15,413
<i>Yeah, I want to be there
when it does.</i>

461
00:31:24,123 --> 00:31:25,725
Yeah.

462
00:31:25,857 --> 00:31:29,528
No, that's good.
That's worth five big ones.

463
00:31:29,662 --> 00:31:32,131
I tell you what. Come by
the office in the bar

464
00:31:32,263 --> 00:31:33,698
any time
after three o'clock,

465
00:31:33,832 --> 00:31:35,835
Tommy will give you
an envelope.

466
00:31:36,635 --> 00:31:37,769
Yeah.

467
00:31:47,479 --> 00:31:48,514
Can I help you?

468
00:31:48,646 --> 00:31:51,282
Yeah, where the hell
is everybody?

469
00:31:51,415 --> 00:31:53,685
You lost? It's lunch time.

470
00:31:53,818 --> 00:31:56,421
Oh, oh. That's why
it's taken this long

471
00:31:56,555 --> 00:31:58,222
just to get
to the steering column.

472
00:31:58,356 --> 00:32:00,992
You know my guys brought that
van in a couple of days ago.

473
00:32:01,125 --> 00:32:04,195
- No, we just got this in here yesterday.
- [laughs]

474
00:32:04,329 --> 00:32:05,630
It's a really
hard leak to find.

475
00:32:05,763 --> 00:32:07,331
We took it out to see
if we got it, but, you know.

476
00:32:07,465 --> 00:32:08,900
Oh, you test drove
it yourself

477
00:32:09,034 --> 00:32:10,770
and you still can't find
the goddamned leak.

478
00:32:10,903 --> 00:32:12,704
[laughs] I told...
Look, I'm gonna get to it.

479
00:32:12,837 --> 00:32:14,740
I'm going to work on it
right now.

480
00:32:14,874 --> 00:32:15,906
Okay.

481
00:32:16,441 --> 00:32:17,876
You have a good day.

482
00:32:22,413 --> 00:32:25,518
[laughs] Crazy old dude.

483
00:32:28,353 --> 00:32:30,990
[machine whirs]

484
00:32:41,267 --> 00:32:43,934
Ah! [grunts]

485
00:32:44,068 --> 00:32:45,570
Ah! [groans]

486
00:32:47,038 --> 00:32:49,407
What the... [screams]

487
00:32:50,476 --> 00:32:51,843
Now, now...

488
00:32:51,977 --> 00:32:56,282
Did you drive this to
Palmetto Way this morning?

489
00:32:56,414 --> 00:32:57,749
How'd it handle?

490
00:32:57,883 --> 00:33:00,451
- [screams] It wasn't me!
- It wasn't you?

491
00:33:00,586 --> 00:33:04,522
- [bones crack]
- [screams] It wasn't me!

492
00:33:05,423 --> 00:33:07,692
- You insane, old man?
- [man] Angel, stop!

493
00:33:07,826 --> 00:33:10,662
- [whimpers]
- Yeah, Angel. Stop.

494
00:33:10,796 --> 00:33:13,365
- Drop the bat.
- Fuck that!

495
00:33:13,498 --> 00:33:15,400
[panting]

496
00:33:15,534 --> 00:33:18,170
You ever seen a
six-fingered auto mechanic?

497
00:33:18,303 --> 00:33:20,005
Do it! [pants]

498
00:33:20,137 --> 00:33:22,106
Yeah, Angel. Do it.

499
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,975
[bat drops]

500
00:33:24,108 --> 00:33:26,177
- [panting]
- Good, now...

501
00:33:26,845 --> 00:33:29,214
You and me and, uh...
Sorry.

502
00:33:29,347 --> 00:33:30,949
- Rob!
- Rob...

503
00:33:31,082 --> 00:33:32,518
We can take our time.

504
00:33:32,651 --> 00:33:35,755
To figure out what happened
to this car this morning.

505
00:33:37,623 --> 00:33:39,491
You ever seen this guy?

506
00:33:40,057 --> 00:33:41,192
No!

507
00:33:41,326 --> 00:33:43,193
- [Rob groans]
- Come on, man!

508
00:33:44,061 --> 00:33:46,765
What about this guy?
You ever see this guy?

509
00:33:47,598 --> 00:33:50,034
[panting]

510
00:33:50,167 --> 00:33:52,703
You know it's going to take me
two hands to break your wrists.

511
00:33:52,836 --> 00:33:55,907
- Reggie! Reggie. It's Reggie.
- Reggie what?

512
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:58,376
Reggie fucking Black guy that
pissed you off, how would I know?

513
00:33:58,509 --> 00:34:00,811
You're not going to tell me
anything to lead me to him?

514
00:34:00,945 --> 00:34:03,048
[Angel] I can find
his license plate.

515
00:34:03,647 --> 00:34:05,049
On the surveillance.

516
00:34:05,717 --> 00:34:07,386
I can get the plate.

517
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:10,389
- What an excellent idea.
- [panting]

518
00:34:10,521 --> 00:34:12,657
Do that, Angel.

519
00:34:12,791 --> 00:34:14,593
Get the license plate.

520
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:16,761
Please hurry!

521
00:34:18,730 --> 00:34:20,465
We'll be here.

522
00:34:35,347 --> 00:34:36,614
[Ben] Hey, hey, hey!

523
00:34:36,748 --> 00:34:38,550
- What?
- You get that shit out of my car.

524
00:34:38,684 --> 00:34:41,454
Well, I only got 15 minutes.

525
00:34:45,923 --> 00:34:47,192
[coughs]

526
00:34:47,324 --> 00:34:49,059
It's a thousand.

527
00:34:49,193 --> 00:34:50,596
What's a thousand?

528
00:34:50,728 --> 00:34:52,364
For an address?

529
00:34:52,498 --> 00:34:54,932
Mr. Myers, been a while.

530
00:34:55,065 --> 00:34:58,903
For old time's sake,
I'm giving you a discount.

531
00:34:59,036 --> 00:35:03,341
That thing's worth 300,
500 tops.

532
00:35:03,474 --> 00:35:05,976
[scoffs] Maybe at the DMV,

533
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:08,947
but then you'd have
to wait in line.

534
00:35:15,253 --> 00:35:17,088
So, um...

535
00:35:17,222 --> 00:35:20,158
What you want with this
Reggie McIntyre anyway?

536
00:35:20,291 --> 00:35:21,893
I just want to talk to him.

537
00:35:22,027 --> 00:35:25,664
Yeah, he's not
very talkative lately.

538
00:35:25,797 --> 00:35:28,967
He, uh, has got an
interesting history, though...

539
00:35:29,701 --> 00:35:34,838
family, associates,
cooperation.

540
00:35:34,972 --> 00:35:38,242
You know, I'm not a very
talkative person either.

541
00:35:38,376 --> 00:35:42,648
I think Reggie and I are
gonna get along just fine.

542
00:35:57,528 --> 00:36:01,900
Detective Wills, you are being
treated to a rare sighting.

543
00:36:02,034 --> 00:36:04,501
May I introduce you to Detective
Lieutenant Nickel Wallace.

544
00:36:04,635 --> 00:36:07,605
She was assigned to Congressman
Billings' outreach team

545
00:36:07,739 --> 00:36:09,574
temporarily, what,
12 years ago?

546
00:36:09,708 --> 00:36:11,142
It's nice to meet you.

547
00:36:11,275 --> 00:36:12,576
It's personal, sir.

548
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:14,746
- You got a desk and a stack?
- Five inches deep.

549
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:20,085
Dig into Rollins' files,
and take any warm ones that are called in.

550
00:36:22,353 --> 00:36:25,556
That's what I like to see
in a homicide detective,

551
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:27,692
- solving homicides.
- [door closes]

552
00:36:27,826 --> 00:36:29,994
Captain, there were
several gunshots fired

553
00:36:30,128 --> 00:36:31,830
at Ben Myers' residence,
and I...

554
00:36:31,963 --> 00:36:37,002
Allegedly, according
to nosy neighbor Gail Gearson,

555
00:36:37,135 --> 00:36:40,171
retired mob boss Ben Myers
fired four or five gunshots.

556
00:36:40,304 --> 00:36:41,606
You already knew.

557
00:36:41,739 --> 00:36:44,242
But, this crime boss
is now,

558
00:36:44,376 --> 00:36:49,014
unbeknownst to any of us,
an upstanding citizen.

559
00:36:51,349 --> 00:36:53,083
But what I didn't know is,

560
00:36:53,217 --> 00:36:55,652
that he had a family relationship
with one of my detectives.

561
00:36:55,786 --> 00:37:00,158
And yes, as long as I'm paying your
salary, you're still one of mine.

562
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:04,829
This is the first I'm hearing
about the expungement, sir.

563
00:37:04,963 --> 00:37:06,999
And my mother and he
never married.

564
00:37:07,132 --> 00:37:10,135
And the joke was that all she
ever got from him was a nickel.

565
00:37:10,268 --> 00:37:15,106
And all that changed a week ago when
you listed yourself as his "in case of"?

566
00:37:15,239 --> 00:37:18,242
I discovered he has cancer.
He doesn't have very long to live.

567
00:37:18,376 --> 00:37:21,179
And so I'm trying to make
right while I still can.

568
00:37:21,313 --> 00:37:22,780
Mm-hmm.

569
00:37:23,315 --> 00:37:24,650
Look, I'm sorry.

570
00:37:24,782 --> 00:37:27,885
Nineteen years ago, sir,
I didn't think that

571
00:37:28,018 --> 00:37:31,021
I needed any more obstacles
than being female and poor.

572
00:37:31,155 --> 00:37:34,692
I didn't think I needed to list
my felon father who left us

573
00:37:34,826 --> 00:37:36,661
when I was four years old.

574
00:37:36,795 --> 00:37:38,097
I'm sorry.

575
00:38:05,322 --> 00:38:06,858
[knocks]

576
00:38:06,992 --> 00:38:08,059
Nan?

577
00:38:08,626 --> 00:38:10,461
Are you in there, Nan?

578
00:38:10,594 --> 00:38:12,864
Nan, it's Nick,
are you okay?

579
00:38:22,072 --> 00:38:23,074
Nan?

580
00:38:23,641 --> 00:38:25,243
Nan, are you okay?

581
00:38:26,210 --> 00:38:28,680
Nan, sweetie, it's Nick.

582
00:38:29,681 --> 00:38:31,349
- Are you in here?
- [whimpering]

583
00:38:31,481 --> 00:38:33,451
Oh, my God! Nan!

584
00:38:34,286 --> 00:38:36,188
[Nan screams]

585
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,089
[sobbing]

586
00:38:38,222 --> 00:38:39,557
Are you hurt?

587
00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:41,391
Are you shot?
Are you all right?

588
00:38:41,525 --> 00:38:43,961
[cries]

589
00:38:44,096 --> 00:38:47,898
- Oh, my God. What happened?
- [sobbing]

590
00:38:48,032 --> 00:38:51,668
Oh, I'm sorry. I'll take care of you.
I'll take care of you.

591
00:38:51,802 --> 00:38:53,371
It's going be all right.

592
00:38:53,503 --> 00:38:55,173
[doorbell rings]

593
00:38:59,911 --> 00:39:01,278
Thank God.

594
00:39:02,179 --> 00:39:06,150
Thank God. I am so glad
you came, Jo.

595
00:39:09,788 --> 00:39:12,257
I did not know
who else to call.

596
00:39:12,391 --> 00:39:13,959
The police?

597
00:39:15,092 --> 00:39:17,495
[sighs]
You are the police.

598
00:39:17,628 --> 00:39:19,463
But you're going to
cover up for your old man

599
00:39:19,597 --> 00:39:22,967
because you owe him for
your magnificent childhood?

600
00:39:23,101 --> 00:39:24,836
Right now, I'm not
worried about him.

601
00:39:24,969 --> 00:39:26,570
All I'm worried about
is Nan.

602
00:39:26,704 --> 00:39:29,307
I have to find somebody who can
take care of her. Right away.

603
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,908
That's all
I'm worried about.

604
00:39:31,041 --> 00:39:33,344
Well, I'm worried
about you, Nick.

605
00:39:33,911 --> 00:39:35,981
What's going on?

606
00:39:36,114 --> 00:39:39,917
You have been so weird ever
since your sister took the boys.

607
00:39:40,052 --> 00:39:43,121
I'm still trying to find
a way to help the boys.

608
00:39:43,253 --> 00:39:46,324
And, you know,
Billings is in trouble,

609
00:39:46,456 --> 00:39:50,127
and I know you don't like him,
but, you know, he's my boss.

610
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:53,264
I want my sister
to forgive me, before she...

611
00:39:56,034 --> 00:39:58,537
- What's the prognosis?
- It's not good.

612
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:01,972
The infection has spread from her
bones to her heart. Endocarditis.

613
00:40:02,106 --> 00:40:05,544
You know her immune system is shot.
She's not gonna make it out of there.

614
00:40:05,677 --> 00:40:08,146
Listen, can you help me
with Nan?

615
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,481
Please.

616
00:40:11,181 --> 00:40:12,817
You're just using me.

617
00:40:13,952 --> 00:40:17,055
- It happens to social workers all the time.
- Shut up. [laughs]

618
00:40:17,188 --> 00:40:20,224
You just want me for my
high-powered connections.

619
00:40:20,358 --> 00:40:25,197
[laughs] Okay, but can you
help me with Nan?

620
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,235
Let me see
what I can do.

621
00:41:21,619 --> 00:41:24,423
[Ben] <i>It felt good
to be doing something.</i>

622
00:41:40,771 --> 00:41:45,943
<i>Plus, Reggie seemed to have
some time on his hands</i>

623
00:41:46,077 --> 00:41:48,113
<i>to enlighten me.</i>

624
00:42:02,994 --> 00:42:07,032

[exhales]

627

[female voice on TV]
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

628
00:42:36,994 --> 00:42:38,396
[Reggie]
Hit that shit.

629
00:42:39,697 --> 00:42:43,268
- [male voice on TV] <i>Oh, yeah.</i>
- [woman moaning]

630

[moaning continues]

631
00:42:50,807 --> 00:42:52,777
- Reggie.
- You!

632
00:42:52,911 --> 00:42:54,278
Stop!

633
00:42:58,983 --> 00:43:02,220
I just wanna talk!
I just wanna...

634
00:43:03,889 --> 00:43:06,090
I wanna...
I just wanna...

635
00:43:06,224 --> 00:43:07,892

[moaning on TV continues]

645
00:43:58,175 --> 00:44:01,344
[Ben] Onyx,
it changed itself

646
00:44:01,478 --> 00:44:04,081
into what you're
looking at right now.

647
00:44:04,215 --> 00:44:05,951
Does that sound familiar
to you?

648
00:44:06,083 --> 00:44:09,754
[moaning on TV continues]

649
00:44:12,889 --> 00:44:17,661
[Ben] <i>Twelve years ago,
a congressman had a problem.</i>

00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:21,099
<i>She was his maid,</i>

651
00:44:21,231 --> 00:44:23,300
<i>so he called me.</i>

652

<i>I guessed
what the problem was.</i>

<i>You just don't bury
some problems.</i>

654
00:44:46,958 --> 00:44:48,259
<i>I let her go.</i>

<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

656
00:44:52,697 --> 00:44:56,635

she would not come back.</i>

<i>She could never come back.</i>

659
00:45:10,014 --> 00:45:12,483
Ay, Yonny!
Are you packed?

660
00:45:12,615 --> 00:45:15,052
We're always moving,
and we didn't do nothing.

661
00:45:15,186 --> 00:45:16,921
It's not safe, Yonny.
Okay?

662
00:45:17,054 --> 00:45:18,489
Is this about the police?

663
00:45:18,623 --> 00:45:20,391
No, it's not about
the police.

664
00:45:20,525 --> 00:45:22,894
A man who knows me,
who knows who I am...

665
00:45:23,027 --> 00:45:24,695
What man? What's going on?

666
00:45:25,829 --> 00:45:28,699
He just saw me today.
Please, go pack your bag.

667
00:45:28,833 --> 00:45:31,036
- Don't make me tell you again!
- Please listen to me.

668
00:45:31,168 --> 00:45:33,304
I'm legal. You said
my father was legal.

669
00:45:33,438 --> 00:45:35,874
So, maybe my father
can help.

670
00:45:36,007 --> 00:45:37,809
Yonatan, please.

671
00:45:37,942 --> 00:45:41,612
I'm trying to tell you.
We can't run forever.

672
00:45:43,414 --> 00:45:45,316
No, listen. We need help.

673
00:45:45,449 --> 00:45:47,318
It's not safe, Yonny.

00:45:47,451 --> 00:45:50,655
[exasperated breaths]

675
00:45:51,456 --> 00:45:54,326
You won't even tell me
who he is.

00:46:52,650 --> 00:46:54,885
[chattering]

677
00:46:55,853 --> 00:46:56,887
Tommy!

678
00:46:57,387 --> 00:46:59,690
Yeah, Ben! On my way.

679
00:46:59,824 --> 00:47:03,126
I thought I told you
to clean up the alley.

680
00:47:03,260 --> 00:47:04,628
Oh, I did, boss.
You didn't see?

681
00:47:04,762 --> 00:47:07,932
Well, uh, there's a fire
in one of the barrels.

682
00:47:08,065 --> 00:47:11,401
Now, now, now, now, when
that fire burns itself out,

683
00:47:11,536 --> 00:47:13,637
I want you
to take that barrel

684
00:47:13,771 --> 00:47:15,606
down to the dumpster
yourself. Okay?

685
00:47:15,739 --> 00:47:18,474
- [sniffs] Uh, yeah, okay.
- What?

686
00:47:18,510 --> 00:47:21,112
- Nothing, enough... I'm sorry, I'm listening.
- All right, shush!

687
00:47:21,244 --> 00:47:26,250
Ray's gonna, is gonna call
someone to pick this up. At 3:15.

688
00:47:26,384 --> 00:47:29,920
And I've been here
since 10:15. Right?

689
00:47:30,889 --> 00:47:32,289
Um...

690
00:47:34,492 --> 00:47:36,694
Oh, yeah. Um...

691
00:47:36,827 --> 00:47:39,297
You were already inside
when I came back in

692
00:47:39,429 --> 00:47:42,733
from cleaning
the alley, right? 10:15.

693
00:47:42,867 --> 00:47:45,637
- So... All right.
- Don't forget to...

694
00:47:45,769 --> 00:47:46,938
You were robbed!

695
00:47:47,070 --> 00:47:49,172
What are you talking about?
Make that call.

696
00:47:49,306 --> 00:47:50,942
I just went by
your house.

697
00:47:54,445 --> 00:47:58,250
Look, let's go inside.
Please!

698
00:48:14,264 --> 00:48:15,732
Are you out of your mind?

699
00:48:15,867 --> 00:48:18,302
You come in my place
in front of my people,

700
00:48:18,436 --> 00:48:20,571
and you say
that I got robbed.

701
00:48:20,704 --> 00:48:22,907
That I got robbed.
[chuckles]

702
00:48:23,041 --> 00:48:25,844
I've been to your house, Dad.
I found Nan.

703
00:48:26,510 --> 00:48:28,280
I took care of her.

704
00:48:29,246 --> 00:48:30,513
I found her a place.

705
00:48:30,648 --> 00:48:32,316
At the Savannah Senior Center

706
00:48:32,449 --> 00:48:35,218
which is a very nice place.
Where it will be completely private.

707
00:48:35,353 --> 00:48:36,820
Discreet. No one
will know about it.

708
00:48:36,954 --> 00:48:39,990
And the most important thing
is she's going to be safe.

709
00:48:43,427 --> 00:48:48,466
Nan is in a home,
and I'm not even dead.

710
00:48:51,268 --> 00:48:52,836
[gasps]

711
00:48:52,969 --> 00:48:55,805
She's safe, that's what
you want for her, right?

712
00:48:55,940 --> 00:48:56,907
[sobs]

713
00:48:57,041 --> 00:48:58,476
But you were robbed, Dad.

714
00:48:58,608 --> 00:49:00,677
The place was a wreck.
I couldn't leave her there.

715
00:49:00,811 --> 00:49:03,580
Why didn't you call
the police? Or me?

716
00:49:03,713 --> 00:49:06,951
[sobs] How many burglaries
did you actually solve

717
00:49:07,085 --> 00:49:10,989
when-when you were
in charge of that, huh?

718
00:49:11,856 --> 00:49:14,726
[sobs]

719
00:49:22,065 --> 00:49:23,433
Let me help.

720
00:49:24,235 --> 00:49:26,804
Tell me how
I can help you, Dad.

721
00:49:26,936 --> 00:49:29,940
I used to be someone
important in this town.

722
00:49:30,875 --> 00:49:36,047
Nothing happens in this town
unless I say so.

723
00:49:37,681 --> 00:49:39,550
[laughs] Now they just...

724
00:49:41,385 --> 00:49:43,722
walk right into my own...

725
00:49:53,097 --> 00:49:54,799
Dad, are-are you...

726
00:49:54,931 --> 00:49:57,500
Are you trying to fix this
by yourself?

727
00:49:57,635 --> 00:50:00,070
You smell
like cleaning fluid.

728
00:50:00,871 --> 00:50:03,474
You changed
your clothes, are...

729
00:50:03,608 --> 00:50:06,845
Are you trying to take
care of this on your own?

730
00:50:08,244 --> 00:50:10,614
I'm at a dead end.

731
00:50:13,150 --> 00:50:15,052

[cell phone vibrates]

733
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:25,728
Oh, Dad, I'm sorry.
I have to take this.

734
00:50:25,862 --> 00:50:27,431
It's, uh,
it's the station.

735
00:50:27,563 --> 00:50:30,167
[cell phone vibrates]

736
00:50:31,568 --> 00:50:34,139
I'm sorry.

737
00:50:36,574 --> 00:50:38,576
Yeah, I remember you.
What's going on?

738
00:50:38,708 --> 00:50:41,278
- [Wills] <i>We got a homicide on 211 San Juan.</i>
- What?

739
00:50:41,411 --> 00:50:43,180
<i>You know anything?</i>

740
00:50:43,313 --> 00:50:46,884
Uh, Reggie McIntyre,
29, skinny?

741
00:50:47,018 --> 00:50:50,253
Shit, what...
Yeah, he was my CI,

742
00:50:50,387 --> 00:50:53,157
but, um, that was
a long time ago.

743
00:50:53,291 --> 00:50:55,927
I-I have no idea what he's
been mixed up in lately.

744
00:50:56,059 --> 00:50:59,563
You have no idea what could have
gotten Reggie McIntyre killed?

745
00:50:59,697 --> 00:51:03,168
I'm sorry, Detective.
I have no idea what happened.

746
00:51:05,469 --> 00:51:07,639
All right, thank you.

747
00:51:08,105 --> 00:51:09,507
Thanks.

748
00:51:18,282 --> 00:51:21,085
Come on, pick up.
Pick up.

749
00:51:24,989 --> 00:51:27,891
Come on, pick up, Jimmy.
Come on.

750
00:51:31,128 --> 00:51:33,764
[cell phone rings]

751

[ringing continues]

752
00:51:41,105 --> 00:51:43,942
Jimmy, I'm right
outside the door.

753
00:51:51,949 --> 00:51:53,851
You weren't gonna
tell me?

754
00:51:55,753 --> 00:51:58,021
He's my cousin.

755
00:51:58,155 --> 00:52:01,159
I'm so sorry. I just found out.
I'm sorry.

756
00:52:01,291 --> 00:52:03,027
I'm sorry.

757
00:52:09,032 --> 00:52:11,802
What's the beard
all about?

758
00:52:14,505 --> 00:52:16,974
Are you going
some place, Jimmy?

759
00:52:21,978 --> 00:52:24,781
You were right
to start packing.

760
00:52:25,717 --> 00:52:28,885
We need to get all of
this shit out of here.

761
00:52:29,018 --> 00:52:30,387
Clear out.

762
00:52:30,521 --> 00:52:32,490
Look, Nick,
I'm taking my cut

763
00:52:32,623 --> 00:52:34,958
and, and Reggie
and Matteo's cut.

764
00:52:35,092 --> 00:52:36,460
In cash.

765
00:52:36,594 --> 00:52:38,262
My aunt will pay
for Reggie's funeral.

766
00:52:38,394 --> 00:52:40,697
Matteo can do whatever the fuck
Matteo does, and I'm out of here.

767
00:52:40,831 --> 00:52:42,666
No, that was not our deal.

768
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:47,037
Okay? I take the cash,
and you guys fence this shit.

769
00:52:47,170 --> 00:52:49,105
Besides, how do you think
it makes you look to run?

770
00:52:49,239 --> 00:52:53,310
I gotta be the dumbest person
alive to ever trusted you.

771
00:52:54,478 --> 00:52:56,113
"Jimmy, he owes me.

772
00:52:56,947 --> 00:53:00,551
Oh, I never done this
before. Help me."

773
00:53:01,552 --> 00:53:03,820
You got me back
into this, Nick.

774
00:53:05,856 --> 00:53:08,992
I'm sorry. I will get you
out of it. I promise.

775
00:53:09,126 --> 00:53:12,429
But we helped each other.
Remember with Reggie?

776
00:53:12,563 --> 00:53:14,097
You got promoted.

777
00:53:14,231 --> 00:53:18,469
And-and Ben Myers used to
take care of people, Nick,

778
00:53:18,603 --> 00:53:20,771
for the mob.

779
00:53:20,905 --> 00:53:24,175
I can tell you that Ben Myers
is an old man dying of cancer.

780
00:53:24,307 --> 00:53:26,275
He's crying
in the back of his bar

781
00:53:26,409 --> 00:53:28,645
because he has no leads.
He has no idea who did this.

782
00:53:28,780 --> 00:53:30,915
Or does he?
Did you screw up?

783
00:53:31,047 --> 00:53:31,881
No.

784
00:53:32,016 --> 00:53:33,784
So why are you running?

785
00:53:34,518 --> 00:53:37,554
I want my cut
in cash today.

786
00:53:37,688 --> 00:53:40,123
- All right. It's not safe.
- That cash...

787
00:53:40,958 --> 00:53:43,360
is my sister's kids'
last chance.

788
00:53:44,295 --> 00:53:46,998
The cash goes with me,
Jimmy. Period.

789
00:53:47,831 --> 00:53:49,933
Like our deal was, okay?

790
00:53:52,003 --> 00:53:54,338
My life's not worth this,
Nick.

791
00:53:55,206 --> 00:53:56,774
Stop.

792
00:53:57,442 --> 00:53:59,376
No, it's not. I'm sorry.

793
00:53:59,509 --> 00:54:02,012
Jimmy, you got to turn around
from that table right now.

794
00:54:02,146 --> 00:54:04,315
You got to show me
your hands. I'm sorry.

795
00:54:04,447 --> 00:54:08,385
Please turn around. Slowly.
Don't even think of...

796
00:54:14,992 --> 00:54:16,227
That's what this is?

797
00:54:17,728 --> 00:54:18,930
The hell with me.

798
00:54:19,063 --> 00:54:20,131
No!

799
00:54:21,465 --> 00:54:23,200
Matteo knows who you are.

800
00:54:23,333 --> 00:54:25,536
Yo, he ain't stupid.
He figured it out.

801
00:54:25,668 --> 00:54:29,373
You need me, 'less you wanna
explain all of this to him.

802
00:54:29,507 --> 00:54:31,175
Officer.

803
00:54:31,307 --> 00:54:34,512
Okay, so let's you and me just
wait here for the cops to show up.

804
00:54:34,644 --> 00:54:36,947
'Cause they're going to come
looking for Reggie's stash.

805
00:54:37,079 --> 00:54:39,048
Something's going to tip
them off, you know, like a,

806
00:54:39,181 --> 00:54:43,119
a receipt for the storage or,
or, or a lock combination.

807
00:54:43,253 --> 00:54:45,356
And then they'll just
bring us in,

808
00:54:45,489 --> 00:54:48,592
but I'm going to take care of you.
I'm going to protect you.

809
00:54:48,726 --> 00:54:50,894
You just lay low, all right?

810
00:54:51,027 --> 00:54:54,530
You play your cards right,
it'll all be fixed soon.

811
00:54:54,664 --> 00:54:56,300
Okay?

812
00:55:00,271 --> 00:55:01,439
What's this?

813
00:55:01,572 --> 00:55:02,907
That's for Reggie's funeral.

814
00:55:03,039 --> 00:55:06,909
It's not "running away
out of town" money.

815
00:55:07,043 --> 00:55:10,147
Its for his mom.
It's to do right by him.

816
00:55:11,014 --> 00:55:13,317
Okay? Just for now.

817
00:55:15,552 --> 00:55:17,788
Just hang on
a little bit longer.

818
00:55:28,766 --> 00:55:30,201
Fine.

819
00:55:31,568 --> 00:55:33,003
It's all yours.

820
00:55:33,871 --> 00:55:36,139
That's yours. What am I
gonna do with it?

821
00:55:36,273 --> 00:55:38,108

No, I agree
that it's a problem.

857
00:57:25,983 --> 00:57:27,851
<i>They can't do this.</i>

858
00:57:27,985 --> 00:57:30,655
No, I'm definitely going to
take care of this for you, sir.

859
00:57:30,788 --> 00:57:32,623
I-I just had a real
bear of a morning.

860
00:57:32,755 --> 00:57:36,159
They've called me into the station,
and I had to do something, so...

861
00:57:36,293 --> 00:57:39,563
I'll be there soon.
I'm almost done. Okay?

862
00:57:39,697 --> 00:57:43,267
I will take care of all
of your crowd control needs.

863
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:45,902
- See you shortly.
- <i>Fine, bye.</i>

864
00:58:06,590 --> 00:58:11,228
Oh, my goodness.
Hey, they got so big.

865
00:58:11,362 --> 00:58:14,264
Hi, sweetheart.
Can I have a little hug?

866
00:58:14,398 --> 00:58:18,135
Oh. I missed you
so much. Wow!

867
00:58:18,268 --> 00:58:23,240
Maybe I could take 'em to the park sometime,
just for a little play, a little visit?

868
00:58:23,373 --> 00:58:26,042
Just for fun?
All right, never mind.

869
00:58:26,175 --> 00:58:28,045
No, not the... We won't
talk about that right now.

870
00:58:28,179 --> 00:58:31,382
I have something else
I want to ask you. Um...

871
00:58:31,514 --> 00:58:34,050
I want to know if you can
hold onto something for me.

872
00:58:34,184 --> 00:58:35,519
[Sherry] What is it?

873
00:58:35,652 --> 00:58:39,689
It's the key to my locker
at the law school gym.

874
00:58:39,824 --> 00:58:41,892
You dropped the law school.

875
00:58:42,025 --> 00:58:45,896
I know, but, um,
I still have my ID.

876
00:58:46,030 --> 00:58:48,298
It's just in case
something happened to me.

877
00:58:48,431 --> 00:58:50,900
I just want you to have
what's inside the locker.

878
00:58:51,034 --> 00:58:53,603
What's going to happen
to you?

879
00:58:53,737 --> 00:58:57,473
Nothing, nothing's going to happen to me.
Just... [sniffles]

880
00:58:57,606 --> 00:59:01,978
I could call Daddy.
I'd like to see him.

881
00:59:02,112 --> 00:59:05,414
You know who you should call is you should
call Joanne. Do you remember Joanne?

882
00:59:05,548 --> 00:59:08,786
Joanne was the one
who helped us with Mom.

883
00:59:08,918 --> 00:59:10,086
Joanne can use my ID,

884
00:59:10,219 --> 00:59:11,721
and she can go back
to the law school

885
00:59:11,855 --> 00:59:14,023
and get everything that's
in the locker for you.

886
00:59:14,157 --> 00:59:16,425
I could ask the church.

887
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:18,695
The people at the church
are so kind.

888
00:59:18,829 --> 00:59:22,266
Honey, I don't want the people
in your church taking it

889
00:59:22,398 --> 00:59:24,467
and giving it
to your preacher.

890
00:59:24,601 --> 00:59:27,637
And I don't want some so-called
friend shooting it up your arm.

891
00:59:27,771 --> 00:59:29,139
Okay?

892
00:59:32,842 --> 00:59:35,945
Can you keep a secret?
Okay?

893
00:59:36,079 --> 00:59:39,950
Daddy gave you a present,
and that's what's in the locker.

894
00:59:40,083 --> 00:59:43,053
- You talk to Daddy?
- Yeah.

895
00:59:43,820 --> 00:59:45,755
- Okay.
- Okay?

896
00:59:45,889 --> 00:59:47,425
Right, so this is a key.

897
00:59:47,557 --> 00:59:50,494
I want you to put it
in a very safe place. Okay?

898
00:59:53,463 --> 00:59:56,132
Matilda? Okay.

899
00:59:56,266 --> 01:00:01,172
And then, if you have to,
here's Jo's number.

900
01:00:04,306 --> 01:00:06,009
You just call Joanne.

901
01:00:06,909 --> 01:00:09,480
What's going to
happen to you?

902
01:00:09,612 --> 01:00:13,483
Nothing. I'm just working for the
congressman tonight. That's all.

903
01:00:14,117 --> 01:00:15,987
I just might be busy.

904
01:00:18,855 --> 01:00:20,657
Will you say hi to Daddy?

905
01:00:20,791 --> 01:00:23,027
Why do you miss him
so much?

906
01:00:24,494 --> 01:00:26,063
I love Daddy.

907
01:00:28,331 --> 01:00:30,201
He loves you, too.

908
01:00:39,742 --> 01:00:43,713
[Ben] <i>Staking out Reggie's wake
was the only lead I had.</i>

909
01:01:03,967 --> 01:01:05,001
[man] Jimmy!

910
01:01:05,135 --> 01:01:07,271
Yo, Jimmy!

911
01:01:10,206 --> 01:01:12,510
It's me, Stokes.

912
01:01:13,911 --> 01:01:15,479
[Jimmy] What up, Stokes?

913
01:01:17,081 --> 01:01:18,916
[Stokes] How you doing, man?
Looking good.

914
01:01:19,048 --> 01:01:21,619
G-O-D-D good.

915
01:01:22,585 --> 01:01:26,322
Man, I like the beard.
Stylish. Sharp.

916
01:01:27,623 --> 01:01:30,460
[Jimmy] That's a motherfucker,
He shouldn't go out like that.

917
01:01:30,594 --> 01:01:33,362
[Stokes] Yeah, man, I'm sorry to hear.
I saw your aunt earlier.

918
01:01:33,496 --> 01:01:36,966
Sorry about your cousin,
Reggie. He was good people.

919
01:01:37,099 --> 01:01:40,304
Tell you what, you and the
family, you need anything,

920
01:01:40,436 --> 01:01:42,438
you know where
to reach me. Right?

921
01:01:42,572 --> 01:01:44,208
- All right, man. I appreciate you.
- All right, B.

922
01:01:44,340 --> 01:01:46,108
- Thanks for coming out.
- Stay strong, man, all right?

923
01:01:46,242 --> 01:01:48,478
- Stay black.
- [Jimmy] Appreciate you.

924
01:02:53,175 --> 01:02:54,911
[engine starts]

925
01:03:15,932 --> 01:03:17,967
[cell phone rings]

926
01:03:18,101 --> 01:03:20,637
[Ben] <i>I wanted to know...</i>

927
01:03:22,139 --> 01:03:24,407
<i>who had done this to me.</i>

928
01:03:25,409 --> 01:03:27,309
Yeah, yo, Matteo.

929
01:03:27,443 --> 01:03:30,846
Nah. No, no, no,
I ain't got it, all right?

930
01:03:30,981 --> 01:03:34,218
Hey, Matteo. Matteo.
Listen, man, I'm out.

931
01:03:34,351 --> 01:03:36,653
All right, I'm gone.

932
01:03:36,786 --> 01:03:39,455
You want, you want it?
You want your cut?

933
01:03:39,590 --> 01:03:41,592
All right,
deal with the girl.

934
01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:45,128
Yo... No. No.

935
01:03:45,260 --> 01:03:46,262
[tarp rustling]

936
01:03:46,396 --> 01:03:48,265
Hey, stop.

937
01:03:48,398 --> 01:03:51,702
We're on a cell, man.
Stop talking, all right?

938
01:03:51,835 --> 01:03:53,336
Yeah, yeah,
I will come see you.

939
01:03:53,469 --> 01:03:55,471
But I ain't got nothing.

940
01:03:55,606 --> 01:03:57,041
All right, all right. Yeah.

941
01:03:57,173 --> 01:04:00,811
[Ben] <i>I wanted to know
who had done this to us.</i>

942
01:04:01,577 --> 01:04:03,681
<i>I was gonna find out.</i>

943
01:04:04,246 --> 01:04:05,515
What the...

944
01:04:05,648 --> 01:04:08,217
[Ben] Put your foot
on the brake right now.

945
01:04:08,351 --> 01:04:10,054
Why are you doing this
to me?

946
01:04:10,186 --> 01:04:13,655
Stop the goddamned car.
Stop the car!

947
01:04:13,789 --> 01:04:16,092
Come on, put your foot
on the brake.

948
01:04:16,226 --> 01:04:17,527
[tires squealing]

949
01:04:17,661 --> 01:04:19,296
Put your foot on the brake.
Stop it!

950
01:04:19,429 --> 01:04:21,365
[Jimmy groans]

951
01:04:21,831 --> 01:04:22,898
[gasps]

952
01:04:23,032 --> 01:04:26,804
[growls] Who are you working...
Goddamn it!

953
01:04:38,380 --> 01:04:40,917

[line ringing]

955
01:04:53,630 --> 01:04:57,201
Where you at, J?
You pulling up?

956
01:04:57,333 --> 01:04:59,101
Look, some spooky
shit's going on, man.

957
01:04:59,235 --> 01:05:00,903
[Ben coughs]

958
01:05:02,505 --> 01:05:03,740
It's me.

959
01:05:04,606 --> 01:05:07,677
[breathing nervously]

960
01:05:13,617 --> 01:05:16,019
[cell phone ringing]

961
01:05:18,222 --> 01:05:21,759
Jimmy, I can't talk right now.
I'll have to hit you up after the rally.

962
01:05:23,893 --> 01:05:26,597
- This would never be enough.
- [groans]

963
01:05:26,730 --> 01:05:29,733
<i>And, uh, we're gonna
need this, too.</i>

964
01:05:33,036 --> 01:05:35,306
Jimmy? Hello?

965
01:05:36,206 --> 01:05:37,974
New phone?

966
01:05:38,106 --> 01:05:40,543
Hey, sorry about that.

967
01:05:42,244 --> 01:05:44,146
- They'll be here, sir.
- Well, let's hope so.

968
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:46,782
And that's why you've got to get
the city to close the street.

969
01:05:46,916 --> 01:05:48,318
I'll get right back
on that, sir.

970
01:05:48,451 --> 01:05:50,019
Okay, thank you.

971
01:05:51,021 --> 01:05:52,423
[grunts]

972
01:05:56,992 --> 01:05:59,663
[huffing]

973
01:06:04,934 --> 01:06:07,637
[Ben] We're going to
smoke 'em out, Tommy.

974
01:06:07,771 --> 01:06:09,473
[sighs]

975
01:06:09,606 --> 01:06:13,210
- Now if you're not up to it...
- No, Ben, I-I got it.

976
01:06:13,342 --> 01:06:14,577
I don't want
any fingerprints.

977
01:06:14,710 --> 01:06:16,413
And there are
cameras everywhere.

978
01:06:16,547 --> 01:06:19,382
No. I got the parts
figured out, Ben, I will.

979
01:06:19,516 --> 01:06:22,318
It's just, are you sure?

980
01:06:22,452 --> 01:06:24,321
I mean, this is
about Nick, isn't it?

981
01:06:24,454 --> 01:06:27,557
Are you
giving me your opinion?

982
01:06:27,690 --> 01:06:28,891
No.

983
01:06:30,159 --> 01:06:33,061
The... Ben, the congressman.

984
01:06:33,195 --> 01:06:34,663
This, this is big.

985
01:06:34,797 --> 01:06:38,302
Okay. That's it, right?
Right.

986
01:06:39,235 --> 01:06:42,071
Well, neither of them
would be there without me.

987
01:06:42,204 --> 01:06:47,277
And I'm going to make damn
sure that they never forget it.

988
01:06:48,210 --> 01:06:51,013
- Now does this meet with your approval?
- [laughs]

989
01:06:51,148 --> 01:06:56,120
Tons could go wrong.
That's all I'm saying.

990
01:06:58,255 --> 01:07:01,057
Tommy. Tommy.

991
01:07:01,190 --> 01:07:04,861
We're just gonna
scare 'em. Okay?

992
01:07:05,594 --> 01:07:07,130
That's it.

993
01:07:08,697 --> 01:07:10,466
Are you with me?

994
01:07:12,235 --> 01:07:13,369
Of course I am.

995
01:07:13,503 --> 01:07:16,539
Okay. Now...

996
01:07:26,181 --> 01:07:28,116
Hey. What?

997
01:07:28,251 --> 01:07:32,189
[Ben] What, what? Everything you're
going to need is in that bag.

998
01:07:32,322 --> 01:07:35,592
You need... stuff.
You got things you got to do.

999
01:07:35,724 --> 01:07:38,694
What am I gonna do with it?
I've got weeks to live.

1000
01:07:38,829 --> 01:07:41,131
Hey! Hey, come on,
don't...

1001
01:07:41,264 --> 01:07:43,700
Don't do that! Mm-mmm!

1002
01:07:43,833 --> 01:07:46,369
You know, you're afraid
of the words.

1003
01:07:46,503 --> 01:07:48,071
I'm dying.

1004
01:07:52,509 --> 01:07:54,177
You're dying.

1005
01:07:58,215 --> 01:08:01,785
This is how you want
to spend your time?

1006
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:05,155
No.

1007
01:08:07,056 --> 01:08:08,891
With what she did...

1008
01:08:09,025 --> 01:08:11,060
You tell me, huh?

1009
01:08:13,496 --> 01:08:17,467
After what she did.
[sighs]

1010
01:08:18,402 --> 01:08:23,172
I want you to
take care of yourself.

1011
01:08:26,909 --> 01:08:29,846
Don't let Ray
give you any shit.

1012
01:08:31,148 --> 01:08:32,583
Okay.

1013
01:08:34,317 --> 01:08:36,019
Okay, Ben.

1014
01:08:57,407 --> 01:08:58,442
[Ray grunts]

1015
01:08:58,574 --> 01:09:00,376
- Hey, Ray.
- Yeah?

1016
01:09:00,510 --> 01:09:02,613
These things aren't going
to hurt anybody, right?

1017
01:09:02,746 --> 01:09:05,849
No, they're all poof.
Just like you, Tommy.

1018
01:09:07,783 --> 01:09:10,219
You've just gotta remember...

1019
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:14,625
to set the timer,
and wait.

1020
01:09:15,625 --> 01:09:18,028
But from a distance.

1021
01:09:39,981 --> 01:09:42,685
Ha, you can't lose a person.
You can't lose them.

1022
01:09:42,819 --> 01:09:44,321
- We have no record of her.
- All right?

1023
01:09:44,453 --> 01:09:47,122
Her name is Nan Myers.
She checked in this morning.

1024
01:09:47,256 --> 01:09:50,659
Now, don't...
don't tell me that...

1025
01:09:50,792 --> 01:09:52,362
That's my wife.
Hold it. Hold it.

1026
01:09:52,496 --> 01:09:53,796
- Hey! Hey! Orderly!
- [nurse] Mr. Myers.

1027
01:09:53,930 --> 01:09:56,166
[Ben] Hey, stop moving!

1028
01:09:58,167 --> 01:10:03,239
[gasps] Look, I just want
to talk to my wife. Okay?

1029
01:10:06,708 --> 01:10:11,782
I wanna talk to my wife.
Alone. Please.

1030
01:10:13,783 --> 01:10:15,118
Thank you.

1031
01:10:15,251 --> 01:10:16,918
Thank you very much.

1032
01:10:17,453 --> 01:10:19,323
Thank you very much.

1033
01:10:32,234 --> 01:10:33,936
Oh, Nan.

1034
01:10:36,271 --> 01:10:40,943
I swore that you would not
wind up in a place like this.

1035
01:10:41,444 --> 01:10:43,280
[sighs]

1036
01:10:47,417 --> 01:10:48,752
Maybe...

1037
01:10:49,952 --> 01:10:51,989
Maybe it'll be okay.

1038
01:10:53,155 --> 01:10:55,359
At least you won't remember.

1039
01:10:59,296 --> 01:11:03,233
Nan, I don't know
how you do that. Just...

1040
01:11:03,865 --> 01:11:06,301
Just let it go.

1041
01:11:06,903 --> 01:11:08,604
I wish I could do that.

1042
01:11:08,738 --> 01:11:12,743
To just let it...
let it go.

1043
01:11:17,514 --> 01:11:20,050
I wish we had more time.

1044
01:11:21,784 --> 01:11:25,055
And I mean just time
with you.

1045
01:11:27,756 --> 01:11:30,292
I've had enough time
with me. [laughs]

1046
01:11:35,864 --> 01:11:37,800
I love you, Nan.

1047
01:12:28,385 --> 01:12:30,619
[speaking Spanish]

1048
01:12:30,752 --> 01:12:32,421
This is all
going to go terrific.

1049
01:12:32,555 --> 01:12:34,057
Yeah, yeah.
[clears throat]

1050
01:12:34,189 --> 01:12:36,192
No, Alan. If this
goes south tonight,

1051
01:12:36,326 --> 01:12:38,728
this is going to be your career on
the line, and I will make sure of it.

1052
01:12:38,860 --> 01:12:42,798
I did exactly what I used to when
we put these together in Lowery.

1053
01:12:42,931 --> 01:12:44,300
In Lowery?

1054
01:12:44,434 --> 01:12:46,302
We're not in Lowery
anymore, sweetie.

1055
01:12:46,435 --> 01:12:48,036
Okay, so when the
Mayor's Office calls

1056
01:12:48,171 --> 01:12:49,838
and says they
can't regulate traffic

1057
01:12:49,972 --> 01:12:52,041
or provide security
outside for our event,

1058
01:12:52,175 --> 01:12:54,677
because "no one is coming,"

1059
01:12:54,810 --> 01:12:56,112
you should share that
with me.

1060
01:12:56,246 --> 01:12:58,213
'Cause you think
it's a problem.

1061
01:12:58,346 --> 01:13:01,216
'Cause it's a big giant
"fuck you," Carrie. Okay?

1062
01:13:01,350 --> 01:13:03,219
How do I get these people
to vote for me

1063
01:13:03,353 --> 01:13:06,922
if I can not get their mayor to
take me fucking seriously? Jesus!

1064
01:13:07,056 --> 01:13:09,826
I don't care how many
people you think are coming.

1065
01:13:09,958 --> 01:13:11,493
The Mayor's Office
will regret

1066
01:13:11,627 --> 01:13:14,596
not adequately protecting your
citizens and your congressman.

1067
01:13:14,729 --> 01:13:16,532
Excuse me?

1068
01:13:16,666 --> 01:13:17,934
What'd he say?

1069
01:13:18,835 --> 01:13:21,270
He said congressman
for now...

1070
01:13:21,404 --> 01:13:22,905
I'm sorry.

1071
01:13:23,038 --> 01:13:25,775
Fuck. Fucking disgrace.

1072
01:13:31,747 --> 01:13:33,315
Maybe this isn't
the best time

1073
01:13:33,448 --> 01:13:36,018
because he's not
expecting this today.

1074
01:13:36,152 --> 01:13:37,886
Maybe some other day.

1075
01:13:38,020 --> 01:13:40,757
Forget it, Mommy.
Forget it. No, forget it.

1076
01:13:40,890 --> 01:13:44,994
I really need you to calm down
and understand that some...

1077
01:13:45,127 --> 01:13:48,163
Yonny!
What are you doing? Hey!

1078
01:13:48,297 --> 01:13:51,033
We're not blocking anybody
if we go to sit up there.

1079
01:13:55,337 --> 01:13:58,942
We ran the ads and did the
promotions, but like you said,

1080
01:13:59,074 --> 01:14:02,112
- we're not in Lowery anymore.
- [sighs]

1081
01:14:04,947 --> 01:14:06,449
Are they there?

1082
01:14:13,055 --> 01:14:15,891
There's enough people
to make this work, John.

1083
01:14:16,024 --> 01:14:17,759
- Oh!
- Oh, sir. Are you okay?

1084
01:14:17,894 --> 01:14:19,161
- Where's your father?
- What?

1085
01:14:19,295 --> 01:14:20,697
- John, what happened?
- [cell phone vibrating]

1086
01:14:20,829 --> 01:14:22,731
I'm good. I'm good.
I'm fine. I'm fine.

1087
01:14:22,864 --> 01:14:24,199
I-I got this, Nick.

1088
01:14:24,332 --> 01:14:25,367
[stammers]

1089
01:14:25,502 --> 01:14:29,806
- John. John, just relax okay?
- I'm fine.

1090
01:14:29,939 --> 01:14:32,442
- [cell phone vibrating]
- Hello?

1091
01:14:32,574 --> 01:14:34,943
[Matteo] <i>I know who robbed your
father's house this morning.</i>

1092
01:14:35,077 --> 01:14:36,613
You know who this is?

1093
01:14:36,746 --> 01:14:38,748
No. Who is this?

1094
01:14:38,881 --> 01:14:40,682
I, I, I... How did you
get this number?

1095
01:14:40,815 --> 01:14:42,117
I called
the police station.

1096
01:14:42,252 --> 01:14:44,254
I told them your father
had an emergency.

1097
01:14:44,386 --> 01:14:47,724
Listen, uh, Jimmy's gone.
Like, disappeared.

1098
01:14:47,856 --> 01:14:49,158
Like, somebody's after us.

1099
01:14:49,292 --> 01:14:52,462
I'm sorry. I think
you have the wrong number.

1100
01:14:52,595 --> 01:14:54,898
Relax. Relax.
I'm on a pay phone.

1101
01:14:55,030 --> 01:14:56,698
I'm not stupid.

1102
01:14:56,832 --> 01:14:58,568
But Jimmy's dead, probably.

1103
01:14:58,701 --> 01:15:00,970
<i>And I want my cut now.</i>

1104
01:15:01,104 --> 01:15:02,972
I-I don't know any Jimmy.

1105
01:15:03,105 --> 01:15:05,907
<i>You're not listening!
Your pops is after me.</i>

1106
01:15:06,042 --> 01:15:09,179
This isn't safe.
I'm not waiting.

1107
01:15:10,546 --> 01:15:15,850
Listen, I disappear tonight.
I get my money tonight.

1108
01:15:15,984 --> 01:15:20,189
After this rally, you're going
to bring me what's mine.

1109
01:15:20,323 --> 01:15:22,358
I do not know who you are.

1110
01:15:22,490 --> 01:15:25,360
I cannot help you.
And do not call this number again.

1111
01:15:25,494 --> 01:15:26,662
Mother...

1112
01:15:31,466 --> 01:15:32,668
[sighs]

1113
01:15:32,801 --> 01:15:34,202
Hey, Nick.

1114
01:15:35,003 --> 01:15:36,305
Wow, you don't look
so good.

1115
01:15:36,439 --> 01:15:38,574
Was that your dad
on the phone?

1116
01:15:38,707 --> 01:15:40,143
No, sir.

1117
01:15:42,444 --> 01:15:44,112
I want you to look over
your left shoulder

1118
01:15:44,246 --> 01:15:47,315
and tell me if you see a
31-year-old Guatemalan woman

1119
01:15:47,449 --> 01:15:49,351
and her son in the
front pew of the church,

1120
01:15:49,485 --> 01:15:51,653
and then tell me what the
fuck they are doing here.

1121
01:15:51,787 --> 01:15:53,422
So you...

1122
01:15:53,555 --> 01:15:55,424
I mean, there are two
individuals that match

1123
01:15:55,557 --> 01:15:58,962
that description down there.
Do you want me to talk to them?

1124
01:16:02,865 --> 01:16:04,333
Okay.

1125
01:16:04,466 --> 01:16:08,537
Maybe I misjudged
the situation, but, Nick,

1126
01:16:08,671 --> 01:16:11,006
don't ever misjudge me.

1127
01:16:11,140 --> 01:16:15,478
In or out of office,
never misjudge me.

1128
01:16:16,512 --> 01:16:18,180
Never, sir.

1129
01:16:24,086 --> 01:16:26,722
[male reporter] <i>We're live in
Christ the Redeemer Sanctuary,</i>

1130
01:16:26,855 --> 01:16:30,193
<i>where embattled US Congressman
John Billings of the 4th district,</i>

1131
01:16:30,327 --> 01:16:34,262
<i>is introducing himself to a
small group of undecided voters.</i>

1132
01:16:34,396 --> 01:16:36,666
Having just lost
his redistricting appeal,

1133
01:16:36,798 --> 01:16:41,738
Congressman Billings must now try to win
over a largely Hispanic constituency,

1134
01:16:41,871 --> 01:16:45,742
a group he once denounced
as freeloaders and illegals.

1135
01:16:45,875 --> 01:16:47,309
He has his work
cut out for him.

1136
01:16:47,443 --> 01:16:49,645
And do you know
what he said to me?

1137
01:16:49,778 --> 01:16:54,516
He said to me, "Honey,
we're not in Lowery anymore."

1138
01:16:55,385 --> 01:16:57,552
So, I don't want to take up
any more time.

1139
01:16:57,685 --> 01:16:59,521
I know you're excited
to hear from him.

1140
01:16:59,655 --> 01:17:03,492
Please let me introduce to you
my husband of 15 years

1141
01:17:03,626 --> 01:17:07,596
and your congressman,
John Billings.

1142
01:17:07,729 --> 01:17:10,632
[cheering, applause]

1143
01:17:10,765 --> 01:17:12,567
Mwah!
Now go sit down.

1144
01:17:12,702 --> 01:17:14,904
[laughs] Thank you.
Thank you very much.

1145
01:17:15,037 --> 01:17:17,673
Thank you so much.
Good evening. Um...

1146
01:17:17,806 --> 01:17:21,010
[speaking Spanish]

1147
01:17:29,984 --> 01:17:31,253
[applause]

1148
01:17:31,386 --> 01:17:33,155
[in English] Thank you very much.
Come on.

1149
01:17:33,288 --> 01:17:34,989
- I tried. I tried.
- [Mrs. Billings] He worked so hard.

1150
01:17:35,123 --> 01:17:36,760
[Billings]
Thank you very much.

1151
01:17:36,893 --> 01:17:40,128
It is always a great honor for me
to come and greet my constituents.

1152
01:17:40,262 --> 01:17:43,565
It is my firm belief
that a representative

1153
01:17:43,699 --> 01:17:46,635
to the Congress of the
United States has one job.

1154
01:17:46,769 --> 01:17:49,639
And that is to represent
the views, needs and dreams

1155
01:17:49,771 --> 01:17:53,475
of the people of the district
that he represents.

1156
01:17:53,609 --> 01:17:56,278
[applause]

1157
01:17:57,046 --> 01:17:59,849
And I have a
good track record

1158
01:17:59,983 --> 01:18:01,449
in delivering
on those dreams.

1159
01:18:01,583 --> 01:18:04,519
And also,
unlike my opponent,

1160
01:18:04,653 --> 01:18:08,224
nothing was handed to me
on a silver platter.

1161
01:18:08,356 --> 01:18:11,493
Every blessing
the Lord has bestowed upon me,

1162
01:18:11,627 --> 01:18:13,228
I had to work for.

1163
01:18:13,362 --> 01:18:15,965
- I had to work really hard.
- [cell phone rings]

1164
01:18:16,099 --> 01:18:19,168
Um, I wanted
to go to college.

1165
01:18:19,301 --> 01:18:21,203
I really wanted
to go to college.

1166
01:18:21,337 --> 01:18:23,606
- [ringing continues]
- I couldn't afford it,

1167
01:18:23,739 --> 01:18:26,407
so, I joined the army
when I was 16

1168
01:18:26,542 --> 01:18:29,846
and I went to Kuwait and
fought in the first Gulf War

1169
01:18:29,979 --> 01:18:32,347
- with an artillery battery.
- [ringing continues]

1170
01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:37,052
I came home. I went to
college, courtesy of the Army.

1171
01:18:37,185 --> 01:18:41,256
And then much to the horror
of some of my army colleagues...

1172
01:18:41,390 --> 01:18:42,958
[ringing continues]

1173
01:18:43,091 --> 01:18:46,161
...I took a commission in the
United States Marine Corps

1174
01:18:46,295 --> 01:18:48,530
and had the great honor
of serving

1175
01:18:48,663 --> 01:18:51,367
in Operation
Enduring Freedom in Iraq.

1176
01:18:51,501 --> 01:18:55,170
I think it's fair to say
that my career can be defined

1177
01:18:55,304 --> 01:18:57,273
as serving my country...

1178
01:18:57,405 --> 01:19:00,775
- [ringing continues]
- ...serving my fellow Americans,

1179
01:19:00,909 --> 01:19:03,445
Americans just like you.

1180
01:19:03,578 --> 01:19:05,782
[applause]

1181
01:19:05,914 --> 01:19:07,317
[ringing continues]

1182
01:19:07,449 --> 01:19:10,318
[Ben] <i>I'd have given anything
to see her face.</i>

1183
01:19:10,453 --> 01:19:12,889
<i>And for her to see mine.</i>

1184
01:19:14,023 --> 01:19:18,560
[speaking Spanish]

1185
01:19:18,694 --> 01:19:22,898
- [protesters chanting]
- [Nick] Sit down! Sit down!

1186
01:19:23,030 --> 01:19:25,001
All units converge...

1187
01:19:25,135 --> 01:19:26,936
It's okay.
Sweetie, it's fine.

1188
01:19:27,069 --> 01:19:29,739
[Nick] ...Christ the Redeemer
Sanctuary, protests have broken out.

1189
01:19:29,872 --> 01:19:31,173
Converge! Converge!

1190
01:19:31,306 --> 01:19:33,809
I need all available units.

1191
01:19:33,943 --> 01:19:36,012
Sit down! Sit down!

1192
01:19:36,145 --> 01:19:40,283
[protesters clamoring]

1193
01:19:40,416 --> 01:19:43,720
[Nick] Get down. Get down.
Let them do their job.

1194
01:19:43,853 --> 01:19:47,457
Possible riot in Christ
the Redeemer Sanctuary.

1195

1196
01:19:49,291 --> 01:19:50,659
[Nick] All units,
please respond.

1197
01:19:50,792 --> 01:19:53,429
Please, please, please.
Are you all right, miss?

1198
01:19:53,563 --> 01:19:55,530
Are you okay? You sure?

1199
01:19:55,664 --> 01:19:58,935
Get them outside.
Get them out of here to a medic right now.

1200
01:20:01,069 --> 01:20:04,573
- [Yonatan] Let me help her. I can help her.
- [Celina] I need my bag, please?

1201
01:20:04,706 --> 01:20:08,543
[Yonatan] Let me help her.
I can help. Please let me.

1202
01:20:08,676 --> 01:20:11,581
- This is Perimeter 3.
- Go for Nick.

1203
01:20:13,181 --> 01:20:17,019
Sanctuary, Northwest Corner.
I've got bombs going off out here.

1204
01:20:17,152 --> 01:20:18,753
Oh, shit,
I've gotta call it.

1205
01:20:18,887 --> 01:20:23,192
Ladies and gentlemen,
I need you to quickly and quietly exit

1206
01:20:23,326 --> 01:20:25,261
through the exits
in the back.

1207
01:20:25,394 --> 01:20:26,494
What's happening?

1208
01:20:26,628 --> 01:20:28,230
Sir, explosions,
you've gotta go.

1209
01:20:28,363 --> 01:20:30,031
Put him in the box
and the missus too.

1210
01:20:30,166 --> 01:20:31,734
Get them out now,
quickly.

1211
01:20:31,868 --> 01:20:33,369
Go on, get out of here.

1212
01:20:33,502 --> 01:20:35,438
[reporter] Although we
can't determine at this time

1213
01:20:35,570 --> 01:20:38,106
if there have been any
injuries or any arrests...

1214
01:20:38,239 --> 01:20:39,841
People, I need you
to move faster.

1215
01:20:39,975 --> 01:20:42,077
The congressman's own detail
tried to break it up...

1216
01:20:42,211 --> 01:20:44,646
[Nick] If anyone's up in the
balcony please call out!

1217
01:20:44,779 --> 01:20:46,748
Becky, we gotta go.
Let's do this outside. Come on.

1218
01:20:46,882 --> 01:20:48,516
[Nick] Like I said,
this is not a drill.

1219
01:20:48,650 --> 01:20:50,586
Guys, get him
out of here. Come on!

1220
01:20:50,719 --> 01:20:53,523
All right,
the congressman's safe.

1225
01:21:08,570 --> 01:21:11,440
Why?
Why did you do this?

1226
01:21:12,875 --> 01:21:14,310
[laughs]

1227
01:21:16,511 --> 01:21:20,817
Now, why did you
do this?

1228
01:21:21,951 --> 01:21:24,354
Why did you kill Reggie?

1229
01:21:25,822 --> 01:21:27,222
Jimmy?

1230
01:21:27,355 --> 01:21:31,926
Everyone you touch,
winds up dead.

1231
01:21:32,060 --> 01:21:36,498
Me and Sherry, Dad,
we're dying on the inside.

1232
01:21:38,568 --> 01:21:40,403
That's life.

1233
01:21:42,238 --> 01:21:43,573
Really?

1234
01:21:47,208 --> 01:21:50,613
[siren wailing]

1235
01:21:50,746 --> 01:21:53,615
I can take care of her.
Mom, I'm right here.

1236
01:21:53,748 --> 01:21:55,984
- [explosion]
- [people scream]

1237
01:21:56,118 --> 01:21:58,855
- [officer] My SUV's across the street.
- [Yonatan] I'm right here.

1238
01:22:00,855 --> 01:22:04,859
- Yonny, come here.
- I'm right here, stay with me, please.

1239
01:22:05,359 --> 01:22:07,029
You made this happen.

1240
01:22:07,596 --> 01:22:09,030
Everybody chooses.

1241
01:22:09,163 --> 01:22:11,500
I don't want any more
of your stupid lessons.

1242
01:22:11,634 --> 01:22:13,769
All of this,
you brought on yourself,

1243
01:22:13,902 --> 01:22:15,537
so I want you
to think about that

1244
01:22:15,671 --> 01:22:17,172
as you're heading
towards your grave.

1245
01:22:17,305 --> 01:22:18,706
Including what you did
to Nan?

1246
01:22:18,841 --> 01:22:21,243
- What I did to Nan?
- Including what you did to Nan?

1247
01:22:21,377 --> 01:22:23,012
Good, shoot me!
Go ahead, shoot me!

1248
01:22:23,145 --> 01:22:25,014
- Everybody...
- Just do it!

1249
01:22:26,548 --> 01:22:28,583
You never listen.

1250
01:22:28,716 --> 01:22:31,753
- Stay with me, Mom.
- Yonny, Yonny!

1251
01:22:31,886 --> 01:22:33,855
- Yonny!
- Mom!

1252
01:22:33,988 --> 01:22:35,823
- Yonny!
- Mom!

1253
01:22:35,957 --> 01:22:37,926
I think what you did
was a lot worse, Dad,

1254
01:22:38,060 --> 01:22:39,929
but you never want
to see your own flaws.

1255
01:22:40,061 --> 01:22:42,797
You never ever want to take
any responsibility for anything.

1256
01:22:42,930 --> 01:22:45,033
You're so
fucking delusional.

1257
01:22:45,167 --> 01:22:48,769
Why don't you ask your
congressman about good and evil?

1258
01:22:48,904 --> 01:22:52,341
I saved his maid
and their unborn child...

1259
01:22:52,475 --> 01:22:55,377
- Okay.
- ...from going straight to hell.

1260
01:22:55,510 --> 01:22:57,813
And I did that.

1261
01:22:58,747 --> 01:23:01,317
Ugh, I'm so finished.
Ask your congressman!

1262
01:23:01,449 --> 01:23:03,452
- You know, I'm... [gasps]
- [gunshot]

1263
01:23:03,586 --> 01:23:06,555
I had no choice.
He was going to kill you.

1264
01:23:06,689 --> 01:23:09,224
- Why did you hang up on me, lady?
- Dad...

1265
01:23:09,358 --> 01:23:10,960
Give me my money!

1266
01:23:11,092 --> 01:23:12,394
[gunshot]

1267
01:23:12,528 --> 01:23:15,164
- [labored breathing]
- Where's Jimmy's phone?

1268
01:23:15,296 --> 01:23:17,298
Mom! Let her go!

1269
01:23:17,431 --> 01:23:19,667
- [explosion]
- Yonny!

1271
01:23:23,204 --> 01:23:25,106
No! No!

1272
01:23:25,239 --> 01:23:26,509
[Nick] Put pressure on it.

Freeze, drop the gun!

Nick Wallace.
I'm on the job.

1279
01:23:51,833 --> 01:23:54,069
I got the shooter.
He was going for the congressman.

[monitor beeping]

1283
01:24:03,779 --> 01:24:07,750
Mr. Myers, are you on
any medications presently?

1284
01:24:07,882 --> 01:24:10,420
- [Ben coughs]
- Mr. Myers?

1285
01:24:15,256 --> 01:24:17,692
- [Ben] Tommy?
- Yeah, Ben.

1286
01:24:20,496 --> 01:24:22,131
Why aren't you
at the bar?

1287
01:24:22,265 --> 01:24:24,834
It's not even
eight o'clock yet, Ben.

1288
01:24:26,368 --> 01:24:28,438
It's not even
eight o'clock?

1289
01:24:31,206 --> 01:24:32,708
In the morning?

1290
01:24:33,242 --> 01:24:34,577
[scoffs]

1291
01:24:35,743 --> 01:24:37,712
You want some help
with that?

1292
01:24:37,846 --> 01:24:41,884
Uh, yeah. Thanks.
Um...

1293
01:24:42,016 --> 01:24:45,953
Oh, just lift up the...
the thing.

1294
01:24:46,087 --> 01:24:47,255
[whirs]

1295
01:24:47,390 --> 01:24:48,724
Yeah.

[whirring stops]

1297
01:25:05,341 --> 01:25:06,942
That kid got hurt.

1298
01:25:07,943 --> 01:25:12,748
That's on me.
'Cause of what I did.

1299
01:25:13,983 --> 01:25:18,119
Now, now, there's...
there's debts, and there's life.

1300
01:25:18,252 --> 01:25:22,290
But you can't do much living
with a-a life full of debts.

1301
01:25:22,425 --> 01:25:27,296
Uh, Tommy,
uh, regret is shit.

1302
01:25:28,197 --> 01:25:31,199
No matter where it starts,
it's shit, okay?

1303
01:25:31,332 --> 01:25:35,437
And I, I need you
to go...

1304
01:25:35,570 --> 01:25:37,739
- Ben...
- Get my...

1305
01:25:40,274 --> 01:25:44,079
I need you to go and get
my pants for me, Tommy.

1306
01:25:45,913 --> 01:25:48,818
Go and get my pants
for me.

1307
01:25:53,722 --> 01:25:57,693
- Gonna get your pants.
- Oh, man, what the hell.

1308
01:26:07,403 --> 01:26:09,338
Here. No, no,
wait, wait, wait.

1309
01:26:09,470 --> 01:26:10,772
Don't go.

1310

to the bar.

01:26:18,948 --> 01:26:20,182
What?

1313
01:26:23,185 --> 01:26:29,391
[sighs] Tommy, you're here.
You're the only one here.

1314
01:26:29,524 --> 01:26:30,893
No.

1315
01:26:33,529 --> 01:26:35,730
Tommy, just...

1316
01:26:35,863 --> 01:26:38,266
- Tommy!

[captain] The hero.
Come on in, Nick.

1318
01:26:55,015 --> 01:26:56,918
They're looking at making
you a key to the city.

1319
01:26:57,051 --> 01:26:59,054
[Wills] Detective Wallace.

1320
01:26:59,188 --> 01:27:02,458
I was hoping you and I could go talk
about the Reggie McIntyre murders

1321
01:27:02,591 --> 01:27:04,360
before you go
unlocking anything.

1322
01:27:04,493 --> 01:27:06,328
I thought that was
all wrapped up.

1323
01:27:06,462 --> 01:27:10,132
Matteo Higuera's good for him
and his cousin, Jimmy Newson?

1324
01:27:10,265 --> 01:27:13,067
- That's what it looks like.
- That is what it looks like,

1325
01:27:13,201 --> 01:27:16,238
but I wanted to tie up a couple of
loose ends with Detective Wallace.

1326
01:27:18,140 --> 01:27:20,309
I'm sorry,
I'd like to help you,

1327
01:27:20,442 --> 01:27:23,444
but I don't really know
anything about Matteo.

1328
01:27:23,578 --> 01:27:25,480
- Never dealt with him?
- No.

1329
01:27:25,614 --> 01:27:27,782
No reason to suspect
he'd know you?

1330
01:27:28,417 --> 01:27:29,885
Matteo didn't know me.

1331
01:27:30,019 --> 01:27:32,020
Let's handle this after.

1332
01:27:32,154 --> 01:27:33,889
Nick, you're due
at City General.

1333
01:27:34,021 --> 01:27:35,858
The congressman's making
some sort of announcement,

1334
01:27:35,990 --> 01:27:37,393
and they've been
calling for you.

1335
01:27:37,525 --> 01:27:40,095
You got it, Captain.
Congratulations, Detective.

1336
01:27:40,229 --> 01:27:42,731
Put some ice on that shiner.
For the press conference.

1337
01:27:42,864 --> 01:27:44,800
I'll catch up with you.

We've done everything we can
for Yonatan here.

He's stable, but he sustained some
trauma to his right frontal lobe.

L5, T6 and T7 vertebrae,

with accompanying edema

01:28:55,069 --> 01:28:58,439
[male doctor] This is obviously an
extra-ordinarily difficult time for you,

1360
01:28:58,573 --> 01:29:01,944
and everyone at City General
is doing all we can...

1361
01:29:02,077 --> 01:29:05,181
[Ben] <i>Different columns
for what I owed,</i>

1362
01:29:07,015 --> 01:29:09,884
<i>what I still
had to settle...</i>

1363
01:29:15,858 --> 01:29:19,494
<i>only now, the math
doesn't hold up.</i>

1364
01:29:23,431 --> 01:29:25,800
<i>Now I gotta pay.</i>

1365
01:29:26,534 --> 01:29:27,936
Daddy?

1366
01:29:31,206 --> 01:29:32,842
Hi, Sher.

1367
01:29:35,077 --> 01:29:37,847
I knew you'd come
to see me.

1368
01:29:48,422 --> 01:29:54,462
Did your guys make
those pictures for you?

1369
01:29:55,764 --> 01:29:58,934
My boys
made these for me.

1370
01:30:02,069 --> 01:30:06,442
They... They drew 'em
right here.

1371
01:30:12,780 --> 01:30:15,317
You would like my boys,
Daddy.

1372
01:30:32,801 --> 01:30:35,004
Nicky... Nicky came?

1373
01:30:37,639 --> 01:30:40,409
- Nicky came yesterday?
- Yeah.

1374
01:30:44,579 --> 01:30:51,086
Did you know she still
goes to that law school?

1375
01:30:51,819 --> 01:30:54,122
She said
it was a secret.

1376
01:30:58,292 --> 01:31:01,529
[groaning]

1377
01:31:03,899 --> 01:31:05,868
Are you good, Daddy?

1378
01:31:15,610 --> 01:31:17,011
Yeah.

1379
01:31:19,448 --> 01:31:21,016
Yeah, I'm good.

1380
01:31:34,662 --> 01:31:36,531
This belongs to you.

1381
01:31:39,201 --> 01:31:44,340
[wheezes] And you have to take
really good care of it.

1382
01:31:45,273 --> 01:31:48,177
'Cause it's for your boys.

1383
01:32:12,734 --> 01:32:16,204
<i>Yonatan...</i>
[speaks Spanish]

1384
01:32:16,337 --> 01:32:18,407
<i>Yonatan, we love you!</i>

1385
01:32:18,539 --> 01:32:21,109
[reporters clamoring]

1386
01:32:23,411 --> 01:32:26,213
She's gonna keep it.
[coughs]

1387
01:32:26,347 --> 01:32:27,548
Sherry?

1388
01:32:30,586 --> 01:32:31,654
Yeah.

1389
01:32:33,154 --> 01:32:36,492
And you're gonna help
with Nan, right?

1390
01:32:38,761 --> 01:32:40,028
Yeah.

1391
01:32:40,162 --> 01:32:43,398
So, we're square.
[coughs]

1392
01:32:43,530 --> 01:32:46,668
Do you think
that makes us square?

1393
01:32:50,471 --> 01:32:54,108
Three people are dead
because of us.

1394
01:32:55,643 --> 01:32:57,212
There is a little boy

1395
01:32:57,345 --> 01:33:00,416
who may never get to
tell his mother...

1396
01:33:05,020 --> 01:33:06,388
Nicky...

1397
01:33:09,490 --> 01:33:13,996
Nicky, you can't go back
to the beginning.

1398
01:33:17,332 --> 01:33:21,337
You gotta, you gotta deal
with the choices you got.

1399
01:33:22,304 --> 01:33:25,405
All I wanted to do
was help those boys.

1400
01:33:25,539 --> 01:33:28,978
I didn't mean
to do all of this.

1401
01:33:31,512 --> 01:33:33,047
Nicky...

1402
01:33:36,518 --> 01:33:38,354
I killed a man.

1403
01:33:38,987 --> 01:33:40,221
Yeah.

1404
01:33:40,889 --> 01:33:43,192
And you robbed your father.

1405
01:33:44,259 --> 01:33:47,596
So, is there
nothing left?

1406
01:33:48,762 --> 01:33:50,631
There's just nothing?

1407
01:33:50,765 --> 01:33:52,134
Nickel.

1408
01:33:56,537 --> 01:34:00,175
I'm, I'm... I'm always...

1409
01:34:03,978 --> 01:34:06,347
I don't know how to...

1410
01:34:11,386 --> 01:34:15,290
I-I... What do I say?

1411
01:34:16,457 --> 01:34:17,725
Nicky...

1412
01:34:20,028 --> 01:34:23,532
We make the best mistakes
we can.

1413
01:34:30,270 --> 01:34:33,407
Oh, baby. Baby.

1414
01:34:33,542 --> 01:34:35,310
[sobs]

1415
01:34:49,591 --> 01:34:51,427
Daddy.

1416
01:34:53,261 --> 01:34:56,698
We make the best mistakes
we can.

1417
01:34:56,831 --> 01:34:59,768
[Nick crying]
