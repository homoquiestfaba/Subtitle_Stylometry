1
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:39,400
the weary gunfighter walked slowly through the saloon.

2
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:42,870
the long miles from Cheyenne had taken their toll

3
00:00:42,871 --> 00:00:44,800
who saying that stuff.

4
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:47,590
he scanned the room with a suspicious eye.

5
00:00:47,591 --> 00:00:50,100
years of being on the wrong side of the law,

6
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:53,600
had taught him that a tough
man can get out of a situation.

7
00:00:53,899 --> 00:00:56,300
but a smart man never gets himself into one.

8
00:00:56,301 --> 00:00:57,460
please quit doing that

9
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:59,920
I just want to have
a shot of whiskey in peace

10
00:00:59,921 --> 00:01:02,460
but the gunfighter would find no peace.

11
00:01:02,461 --> 00:01:03,970
for the Henderson boys were

12
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:05,890
waiting in the corner to kill him for

13
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:08,700
the $200 bounty on his head.

14
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:09,999
that true.

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,910
you boys trying to kill me like this voices say

16
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,500
no.

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,950
lied the oldest Henderson boy.

18
00:01:19,951 --> 00:01:20,999
how do you know I'm lying.

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,300
- the oldest Henderson boy
asked to the air. - no.

20
00:01:23,301 --> 00:01:26,209
I didn't ask the air
I'm asking you, your fucking..

21
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:27,999
..voice.

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,180
- said the oldest Henderson boy.
- do please stop saying said..

23
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:33,549
- ..the oldest Henderson boy.
- implored Tommy,

24
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:36,500
the oldest Henderson boy.

25
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,159
meanwhile the younger Henderson's
hand twitched by the..

26
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:41,100
..Colt Peacemaker on his right hip.

27
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:43,420
he was thinking of shouting look out behind you

28
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:45,340
to trick the gunfighter into turning around

29
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:46,750
so he could shoot him in the back.

30
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:49,780
- no I was not.
- come on Johnny, again with..

31
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:50,950
..the look behind you
what were you gonna..

32
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:52,700
..say was behind him this time.

33
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,000
nothing.

34
00:01:54,011 --> 00:01:56,850
Johnny lied. he was going to say a bear.

35
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,000
Oh, came on.

36
00:01:58,401 --> 00:02:00,399
bear Johnny in a saloon.

37
00:02:00,801 --> 00:02:02,200
Johnny's face turned red.

38
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,440
he began wishing he was in a safe place.

39
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,500
- at home in bed with his dolls.

40
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:13,180
- what hey, I ain't got no dolls.
- to calm his nerves he..

41
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:15,280
..pictured himself combing his doll's hair..

42
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,540
-..and pouring them each a cup of tea.
- no.

43
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:24,400
wait wait wait you have 
tea parties with your dolls.

44
00:02:24,401 --> 00:02:25,990
but something about the

45
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:28,240
younger Henderson's vulnerability opened

46
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:31,400
- ..a door in the gunfighters heart.
- nope. no it didn't.

47
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:33,940
 inside a sea of confusing

48
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:36,000
- ..emotions bubbled to the surface.
- no.

49
00:02:36,001 --> 00:02:38,230
he started imagining himself holding

50
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:41,500
the younger Henderson 
and stroking his greasy hair.

51
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,599
- no.  - he pictured his first
kiss with the younger Henderson.

52
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:47,030
- no. - they both giggle at 
how clumsy it was.

53
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:48,999
they know the next one will be even better.

54
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,500
 I'm seriously not picturing that.

55
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:54,000
- but inside he was.
- no, I'm not.

56
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,900
- but he was. - no, I'm not
 in that's a final word.

57
00:03:07,549 --> 00:03:10,000
- but he was. 
- God damn it. 

58
00:03:10,399 --> 00:03:12,999
- why don't you two go 
get a room.  - hey..

59
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,500
why should we trust this voice anyway

60
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,400
- just then the gunfighter
had an idea. - hey..

61
00:03:18,401 --> 00:03:19,300
- you.
- me?

62
00:03:19,301 --> 00:03:20,628
think of a number between one

63
00:03:20,629 --> 00:03:22,639
and a hundred and then we'll see if this

64
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:24,260
voice really knows what we're thinking.

65
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:27,560
- okay got it.
-Sally the whore began..

66
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,200
..thinking of her favorite number.. 

67
00:03:29,201 --> 00:03:30,990
..which was 32.

68
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,109
she then thought of her lady parts and

69
00:03:33,109 --> 00:03:35,060
how itchy they were before deciding to

70
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:37,600
change her mind and go with 76.

71
00:03:37,819 --> 00:03:40,780
- her second favorite number.
- the voice is rad.

72
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:44,209
32 is my favorite number but then I..

73
00:03:44,209 --> 00:03:46,579
- ..changed my mind I went with 76.
- and your..

74
00:03:46,579 --> 00:03:49,040
- ..couch.
- husband issues I'm at horrible

75
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,800
since Saturday bill.
you know anything about that.

76
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:56,239
- oh no.
- he did, but we'll get to..

77
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:57,250
that in a minute.

78
00:03:57,251 --> 00:03:59,329
looks like that voice really does know

79
00:03:59,329 --> 00:04:01,519
- ..everything.
- the gunfighter noticed for..

80
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:03,650
the first time that 
the bartender was black.

81
00:04:03,651 --> 00:04:06,019
this was still unusual in the West

82
00:04:06,019 --> 00:04:08,999
but the gunfighter decided
 he was okay with it.

83
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:12,979
- um thanks.
-the people in the town..

84
00:04:12,979 --> 00:04:14,959
prided themselves for their progressive

85
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:17,350
- ..attitudes about race.
- that's right.

86
00:04:17,351 --> 00:04:19,399
but would they still feel that way if they

87
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:22,150
knew that Sam had been 
sleeping with Ned shillings wife.

88
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,630
what

89
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:28,449
relax Ned all right everyone has been with her.

90
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:31,600
- guilty.
- yeah you're right.

91
00:04:31,601 --> 00:04:36,100
- and Elijah Jessup sister.
- well Sam has dead.

92
00:04:37,999 --> 00:04:40,070
watch yourself Jessup you best put that

93
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:43,360
gun down I'll cut you in half.

94
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:50,740
that music seems kind of ominous tone it

95
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:53,860
hominis what's that mean

96
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:55,750
you know like like something Bad's about

97
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:58,849
to happen like i canti this gun fat.

98
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:02,100
the stage was set for an awesome ballet of death.

99
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,420
blood would be spilled.
but who..

100
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:06,850
- ..would be the first.
- wait singer, ballet of..

101
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:08,590
..death, what the hell.

102
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:11,199
I think this voice wants us to kill each other.

103
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,180
meanwhile the gunfighter saw his

104
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:15,730
- ..opening to shoot Tommy dead.
- no no wait.

105
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:18,220
that that one really is a lossy my hands

106
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:20,980
- ..don't need my gun.
- okay you got me that..

107
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:23,140
..one wasn't true.
 but this one is..

108
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:25,390
..yesterday Tommy Henderson 
made sweet..

109
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:28,700
- ..love to build Jessup's wife.
- oh, nooo!

110
00:05:28,701 --> 00:05:30,899
wait he's left why mama?

111
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,000
here's the thing about that.

112
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:36,700
- Oh you are dead Henderson.
- said Gabriel..

113
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,590
..who had recently delivered a load of..

114
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:40,950
..cream to the back 
porch of his brother's wife.

115
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,650
- he did her in the butt.
- what?

116
00:05:45,651 --> 00:05:48,460
- how could you your own brother. 
- yet even as..

117
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:51,070
bill reacted with disgust the irony was

118
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:54,220
- ..not lost on. - know what
I see oh where are

119
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,960
you going with this and I'm just gonna

120
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,550
retract my disgust right
now if that's possible.

121
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:00,010
for he had been regularly

122
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:02,860
- ..sneaking into Paul Valentine's barn.
- okay,..

123
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:04,900
..you know we're good
we're good here I

124
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:08,200
- ..think we should just move on.
- where he'd

125
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:11,300
been having sex with
Paul's favorite sheep Martha.

126
00:06:11,301 --> 00:06:14,650
- oh boy.
- Martha Phil! Martha!..

127
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:16,900
that is why I've been so itchy

128
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:19,210
oh you know what we all just need to

129
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:21,000
take a deep breath here.

130
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:23,800
we're playing right 
to the voices hands.

131
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:27,000
sure there's been a surprising 
amount of infidelity in this town.

132
00:06:27,001 --> 00:06:29,999
and the bestiality should probably stop.

133
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,170
and I might be gay.
 but if..

134
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:35,170
..we start shooting the voice wins.
I think..

135
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:37,079
the voice is giving us an opportunity.

136
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,340
 in a world where our deepest darkest

137
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:41,700
secrets are unveiled one by one.

138
00:06:41,701 --> 00:06:44,100
maybe we'll stop doing the things were ashamed of.

139
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,420
and start to embrace the things about

140
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:48,400
ourselves we're afraid to accept. 

141
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:49,930
hell this could be the beginning of a new

142
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:53,500
utopia a society based on fairness and

143
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,840
tolerance where

144
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,290
don't matter if you're rich,

145
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,000
- you're poor... 
- or a woman.

146
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,429
let's not get carried away

147
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:02,280
but the point is is that the boys is

148
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,840
showing us the worst side of ourselves

149
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,899
and we need to show it our best.

150
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,899
now who's winning?

151
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:14,809
it was a good speech and things might

152
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:16,819
have turned out differently if the crowd

153
00:07:16,819 --> 00:07:19,129
never found out that the gunfighter had

154
00:07:19,129 --> 00:07:21,619
just last night shot and killed the

155
00:07:21,619 --> 00:07:23,819
youngest son of John McCullers.

156
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:26,629
because he quote had some breath that smelled

157
00:07:26,629 --> 00:07:28,800
..like the ascend of a Chinaman.

158
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,800
well you must be mr. McCullers.

159
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:53,600
it was a true ballet of death.

160
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,950
when the gruesome bloodbath was over.

161
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:00,400
not a single person was left standing.

162
00:08:00,999 --> 00:08:02,100
except for Sally.

163
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,300
the Itchy whore.

164
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,600
you who celebrated by scratching her front porch.

165
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,559
little did she know she would be mauled

166
00:08:12,559 --> 00:08:15,550
to death by a rabid wolf the very next day.

167
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,800
well fuck.

168
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,500
