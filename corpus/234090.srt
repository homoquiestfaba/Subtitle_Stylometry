1
00:00:20,987 --> 00:00:23,581
<i>There's this thing called</i>
<i>"The Law of Man"...</i>

2
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:26,959
<i>list of rules going back to,</i>
<i>like, Lincoln.</i>

3
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,287
<i>Probably even</i>
<i>those Ice Age dudes.</i>

4
00:00:29,496 --> 00:00:31,862
<i>I don't mean rules like</i>
<i>"don't knock up your sister"...</i>

5
00:00:32,065 --> 00:00:34,590
<i>although that's</i>
<i>a pretty good rule. No.</i>

6
00:00:34,801 --> 00:00:37,964
<i>I'm talking about the do's and</i>
<i>dont's of hooking up.</i>

7
00:00:38,171 --> 00:00:42,369
<i>It's all in "The Law of Man",</i>
<i>from the first play to the big show.</i>

8
00:00:42,575 --> 00:00:46,341
<i>Without it, bro, you're just</i>
<i>a rat on the carcass of love.</i>

9
00:00:46,746 --> 00:00:49,340
<i>Take my boy Jay</i>.
<i>That's him right there.</i>

10
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:53,613
<i>Doesn't look like a criminal, but</i>
<i>he violated the first "Law of Man".</i>

11
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:57,012
<i>The law that says</i>
<i>"don't get hung up on one chick...</i>

12
00:00:57,257 --> 00:00:58,519
<i>ever"</i>.

13
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:03,954
<i>lf you want to see what</i>
<i>the punishment is, stick around.</i>

14
00:01:04,164 --> 00:01:07,395
<i>Because for Jay,</i>
<i>today is "judgment day".</i>

15
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:14,895
Kim?

16
00:02:18,171 --> 00:02:20,162
Kim, are you home?

17
00:02:22,842 --> 00:02:25,106
-Kim?
-You're back early!

18
00:02:25,945 --> 00:02:29,540
It's not every day you celebrate
three years with the same woman.

19
00:02:29,782 --> 00:02:32,580
It's Jay.
Yes, it's my boyfriend.

20
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:36,648
When you get out of the shower,
keep your eyes closed.

21
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:45,722
Kim?

22
00:02:53,072 --> 00:02:54,334
Oh, hi, honey.

23
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:57,138
Who is that?

24
00:02:57,443 --> 00:02:58,774
Her?

25
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:01,173
-That's Tanisha.
-What's up?

26
00:03:01,614 --> 00:03:03,275
That's our mail lady.

27
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,719
-Well, everything's cool.
-Everything is not cool.

28
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,649
The person that delivers
my phone bill...

29
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:10,652
is exposing her nipples
in my shower.

30
00:03:10,957 --> 00:03:12,925
Well, she was walking
through the garden...

31
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:16,323
and a huge bug
went right into her shirt and...

32
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:19,361
-Big ol' wasp!
-Why is she naked?

33
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:21,958
Well, it stung her
so many times...

34
00:03:22,168 --> 00:03:23,999
I had to get her
under hot water immediately.

35
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:27,000
That's why my areolas
are so swollen.

36
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:30,870
-A sting can be very serious.
-She could have saved my life.

37
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,814
Oh, gosh...
I feel like such an ass.

38
00:03:36,015 --> 00:03:39,883
No, I would have thought
the exact same thing.

39
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:43,884
-Forgive me, babe?
-Oh, you know I love you.

40
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:47,420
So sweet.

41
00:03:47,627 --> 00:03:50,562
Can you run down to the drug store
and get some aloe?

42
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:53,024
Oh, yeah, sure.
Yeah, okay.

43
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:55,863
Tanisha, you hang in there.

44
00:04:00,673 --> 00:04:03,870
You know, maybe I should call
the post office and let them...

45
00:04:07,213 --> 00:04:08,646
See it?
Right there.

46
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:12,942
The exact nanosecond Jay
gets spanked by the "Law of Man".

47
00:04:16,556 --> 00:04:19,116
<i>in case you're wondering</i>,
<i>that's me, Dewey</i>.

48
00:04:19,325 --> 00:04:21,759
<i>I'm helping Jay</i>
<i>move to his sister's</i>.

49
00:04:21,961 --> 00:04:24,122
<i>Can I be the sensitive</i>
<i>pal or what?</i>

50
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:27,163
The mail lady?

51
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:34,198
-She must have given you some hint.
-Nothin'.

52
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:37,532
"Lesbo cravings"
don't come out of left field.

53
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:40,372
She didn't leave any labia magnets
on the refrigerator, okay?

54
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:43,640
-You've got to stop doing this.
-I'm not doing anything.

55
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:45,841
You're leeching onto chicks.
It's embarrassing.

56
00:04:46,052 --> 00:04:48,043
-I am not.
-Three years with Kimmy...

57
00:04:48,254 --> 00:04:51,087
two with that horsey-faced one...
leeching.

58
00:04:52,158 --> 00:04:53,216
Watch it!

59
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,821
This is Wilt 's car.

60
00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:58,360
-I didn't scratch it.
-Not the point.

61
00:04:58,564 --> 00:05:00,930
Wilt Chamberlain bought this car
on his rookie year in the N.B.A.

62
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:03,659
You don't disrespect
a man of his achievements.

63
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:06,134
Can we move my stuff in now?

64
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:08,864
Man's beard trimmer is still
in the glove compartment.

65
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:10,801
Hey, Suz!

66
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:13,604
I cleared off the couch and
put out the good guest towels.

67
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:17,613
-Thanks, Suz. I appreciate it.
-Oh, poor bro' had a rough day?

68
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:20,276
Remember, Proverbs teaches us:

69
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:24,354
"lf you faint in the day of
adversity your strength is small."

70
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:26,022
Hi, Dewey.

71
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,452
Susie...

72
00:05:29,195 --> 00:05:32,255
-Please, can I fuck your sister?
-Do me a favor...

73
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:35,059
What? You know
she should lose it to me.

74
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:36,997
One night.
That's all I'm asking.

75
00:05:37,203 --> 00:05:40,001
And I'm answering the same way
I have since the sixth grade.

76
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:41,696
My sister is off limits.

77
00:05:41,908 --> 00:05:43,773
Just 'cause you have to move in
with every chick you nail...

78
00:05:43,976 --> 00:05:45,568
doesn't mean the rest
of us need to.

79
00:05:45,778 --> 00:05:48,542
Just because you're addicted to sex
doesn't mean everybody else is.

80
00:05:48,748 --> 00:05:50,909
Addicted?
Where do you get that?

81
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:55,783
Want to match Wilt Chamberlain's
record of twenty thousand women?

82
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:59,287
I'll beat his score. All I have to do
is maintain 2.3 chicks per day...

83
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:02,052
...for the next 2O years.
-I stand corrected.

84
00:06:02,261 --> 00:06:04,661
I'm already ahead
of where he was at 26.

85
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:09,396
-Please?
-No. It's nice you're finally...

86
00:06:09,602 --> 00:06:12,594
setting goals for yourself,
but leave my sister out of this.

87
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:16,936
<i>"Law of Man"</i>,
<i>sub-chapter 16:</i>

88
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:20,873
<i>"The cool gene cannot be bought".</i>
<i>You just have it.</i>

89
00:06:22,982 --> 00:06:25,507
<i>Don't say anything to Phil,</i>
<i>though, huh?</i>

90
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:34,458
What's up, Jay? You guys
aren't gonna believe this shit.

91
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:37,390
-Where you been, man?
-At Malcolm's. Listen.

92
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:40,964
This is huge.
Scott has gone and done it.

93
00:06:41,701 --> 00:06:45,432
<i>Scott. Now, Scott's the poster</i>
<i>for "The Law of Man".</i>

94
00:06:48,641 --> 00:06:52,600
The dude has more than just game,</i>
<i>he owns the sport</i>.

95
00:06:53,513 --> 00:06:56,482
<i>Which is what makes his little</i>
<i>announcement so frightening.</i>

96
00:06:57,116 --> 00:06:58,743
-You're getting married?
-Yeah.

97
00:06:58,951 --> 00:07:01,419
-You mean like to a chick?
-No, not a "chick".

98
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:05,057
An unbelievable creature of rare
beauty. Change that, would you?

99
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:07,556
-It's not that "Linda" is it?
-Or that Russian honey...

100
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,557
What's her name?
The one with the cigarette trick?

101
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:11,320
No, no.
Her name is Teresa, you guys.

102
00:07:11,531 --> 00:07:14,159
I met her while I was scaring up
venture down in Santa Barbara.

103
00:07:14,634 --> 00:07:17,262
Webmaster sent
their second notice for payment.

104
00:07:18,037 --> 00:07:21,370
Rip a check in half, mangle
the envelope and then send it, okay?

105
00:07:21,574 --> 00:07:23,439
You're not really gonna marry
someone you just met?

106
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:26,737
-Man, that's crazy.
-Wait 'till you meet her, you guys.

107
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:30,814
Teresa's unbelievable. On our
first date she takes me out sailing.

108
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:33,451
Then we went over to the Biltmore,
we crashed the brunch.

109
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:35,587
-By the time they served dessert...
-No, no... Don't do that!

110
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:39,451
We were in love. She even took me
home to meet her old man.

111
00:07:39,859 --> 00:07:42,589
Dude, you know this is,
like, forever, right?

112
00:07:43,763 --> 00:07:47,631
Yeah, I know that. Which is why
I want you to be my best man.

113
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:51,125
And the rest of you guys, too.
Seriously.

114
00:07:51,737 --> 00:07:53,637
I want you standing there
beside me next Sunday.

115
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,702
-Next Sunday?
-It's fast, ain't it, "Scott-o"?

116
00:07:57,043 --> 00:07:59,034
Dude, you don't let
something like this get away.

117
00:07:59,745 --> 00:08:02,407
-Something like what?
-Teresa, of course.

118
00:08:04,116 --> 00:08:08,644
Okay. But if you make me read some
lame-ass poem, I'll beat you down.

119
00:08:21,634 --> 00:08:23,761
We're groomsmen now, baby!

120
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:56,930
-I don't want to go to this wedding.
-What?

121
00:08:57,169 --> 00:08:58,761
I miss Kim.

122
00:08:59,238 --> 00:09:01,570
-I would have done anything for her.
-See, that's your problem.

123
00:09:01,774 --> 00:09:04,299
You just can't seem to separate
your dick from your emotions.

124
00:09:07,146 --> 00:09:08,135
Phil?

125
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,279
Bogies, six o'clock.

126
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:16,179
I can't separate my emotions?
Where do you get that?

127
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:18,389
All right, when was the last time
you had a one night stand?

128
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,582
-Well...
-How about never?

129
00:09:20,793 --> 00:09:22,727
You should just put
your testicles up on Ebay.

130
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:28,164
Smile for the butt!

131
00:09:30,603 --> 00:09:33,128
Look, dude,
we are going to a wedding.

132
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:35,136
This is where
panties get moist...

133
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:38,708
chickies surrender their inhibitions
and you are right there in a tux...

134
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:41,141
ready to run the table.

135
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:46,117
The banquet is yours
to plunder, my friend.

136
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:48,378
Do not be sitting
this one out.

137
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,553
See what I'm saying?

138
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:56,057
Women can just sense
the aroma of "man oil".

139
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:59,725
Smile for the butt!

140
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:05,832
-You mooned them, didn't you?
-Wasn't I supposed to?

141
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:09,769
How many times I got to tell you
we don't moon the bitches.

142
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:13,405
I thought you said
we don't moon the handicapped?

143
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:14,910
Them neither.

144
00:10:19,752 --> 00:10:21,686
-Guys?
-What?

145
00:10:21,887 --> 00:10:23,514
-What's that?
-What's what?

146
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:37,298
I could have a one-night stand
any time I wanted to.

147
00:10:37,503 --> 00:10:39,596
-Yeah, but you won't.
-Maybe I will.

148
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:43,007
-You care to back that up?
-Maybe I do?

149
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:46,337
-Then bring it.
-I don't score this weekend...

150
00:10:46,545 --> 00:10:48,775
you can have
my backstage passes.

151
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:50,346
I don't think so.

152
00:10:50,549 --> 00:10:52,517
I'll throw in
my Jackie Chan DVDs.

153
00:10:52,718 --> 00:10:56,677
Not even close. This has to be
something you'd die for.

154
00:10:57,023 --> 00:10:58,684
Like what?

155
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:02,623
I am not betting my sister.

156
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:04,989
-'Cause you don't think you'll score.
-Yes, I do.

157
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:07,229
-So?
-Okay.

158
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:09,128
I don't hook up this weekend...

159
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:11,098
you can have my sister.
But there's a condition.

160
00:11:11,303 --> 00:11:12,497
Name it.

161
00:11:12,938 --> 00:11:14,496
Give up sex.

162
00:11:14,707 --> 00:11:16,834
-What are you, freakin' nuts?
-Just for the weekend.

163
00:11:17,043 --> 00:11:18,442
-Why would l?
-Because you can't...

164
00:11:18,644 --> 00:11:23,138
...not even for three days.
-I'm in total control of my weapon.

165
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:25,249
-Prove it.
-Okay.

166
00:11:25,651 --> 00:11:27,585
I am so sure of my shit...

167
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:30,312
that if I bone one single chick
this whole weekend...

168
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,514
Including sodomy.

169
00:11:33,926 --> 00:11:35,917
Including sodomy.

170
00:11:36,662 --> 00:11:39,028
I will give you this car.

171
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:41,733
Wilt's car?

172
00:11:41,934 --> 00:11:44,334
-Damn straight.
-You're on.

173
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:51,703
Phil?

174
00:12:17,336 --> 00:12:21,397
-Are you sure this is the place?
-How much righter can you get?

175
00:12:21,607 --> 00:12:25,270
If we get arrested for trespassin',
I don't know y'all.

176
00:12:30,382 --> 00:12:32,043
Hello?

177
00:12:32,818 --> 00:12:36,345
Hey. Hey, look at this little fella.

178
00:12:36,555 --> 00:12:39,080
-Don't be pettin' the swine, man.
-No, it 's okay.

179
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:41,589
These little pot-bellied pigs
are like pets.

180
00:12:41,794 --> 00:12:43,159
I wouldn't go there.

181
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:48,326
-Hey, stop it.
-See? That's what I mean.

182
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,068
Hey, cut it out!

183
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:54,235
-Hey, a little help here?
-Down, Pepper.

184
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,169
He's just making friends.

185
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:03,439
You must be from
the United Negro College Fund.

186
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:08,776
No, we're Scott's friends.

187
00:13:09,054 --> 00:13:12,683
Oh, nice. Come in.
I'll write you boys a check.

188
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:17,890
I'm Aunt Eppie. I also give
to those fetus people...

189
00:13:18,097 --> 00:13:19,826
so don't expect a fortune.

190
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:22,323
Are you like, psychotic?

191
00:13:26,105 --> 00:13:27,299
-Hello.
-Hi.

192
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:30,265
Gentlemen, "carpe assum".

193
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:35,342
So your company supplies every
single meal coming out of "LAX"?

194
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:39,314
Except for vegetarian. Those plant
people give me the creeps.

195
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:42,487
Oh good! I'm glad you are here.
I want you to meet Teresa's father.

196
00:13:42,688 --> 00:13:44,519
Mister Shatwell,
these are my groomsmen.

197
00:13:44,723 --> 00:13:46,987
This is Phil, Jay,
and my best man, Dewey.

198
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:49,593
Dude, your crib fuckin' rocks.

199
00:13:50,796 --> 00:13:53,560
Hey, I bet you're thirsty.
We'll be right back. Come here.

200
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:56,496
How come you never mentioned
how loaded these people are?

201
00:13:56,702 --> 00:13:58,966
-I'm sure I did.
-No, you didn't, I'd have remembered.

202
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:00,832
Mister Shatwell
is a food service legend.

203
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,600
You guys can't believe
how much coin he is sitting on.

204
00:14:03,809 --> 00:14:05,276
-So where is she, anyway?
-Who?

205
00:14:05,477 --> 00:14:08,139
-Your bride, man.
-Oh, yeah, Teresa.

206
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:11,578
She's picking up her dress. She'll be
a little late. ln the meantime...

207
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:13,581
I bet you guys
are anxious to get started.

208
00:14:13,786 --> 00:14:15,651
-Started?
-The honeys?

209
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:18,915
We are here
for you alone, bro'.

210
00:14:19,225 --> 00:14:22,353
Please, I'm getting married,
not castrated.

211
00:14:22,561 --> 00:14:26,827
Direct your attention to the bar,
you'll find what you're looking for.

212
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:30,365
Brooke and Melodie,
bridesmaids with all the trimmings.

213
00:14:30,603 --> 00:14:35,040
These girls are the cream in
the Oreo so bring in your "A" game.

214
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:38,471
Yeah. I gotta go.
Go easy on 'em.

215
00:14:41,113 --> 00:14:43,138
You're up.

216
00:14:51,657 --> 00:14:54,717
-Haven't we met?
-I'm not sure.

217
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:58,454
-Maybe that one could bend over?
-I'm sorry.

218
00:14:58,664 --> 00:15:00,996
I thought you were handicapped.

219
00:15:01,867 --> 00:15:05,701
No.
What I meant to say was...

220
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:08,232
We'll catch up later, then.

221
00:15:08,507 --> 00:15:10,407
Yeah. We'll be right here.

222
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,071
You know...

223
00:15:13,946 --> 00:15:16,676
I feel bad, bro'.
Tell you what...

224
00:15:16,882 --> 00:15:17,940
You give up your sister now...

225
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:20,983
and I promise I won't sell
the videos that I make.

226
00:15:21,186 --> 00:15:25,213
No. I am perfectly capable of
having sex with one of those girls.

227
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:26,618
-Well, then get going.
-I'm going.

228
00:15:26,825 --> 00:15:28,019
Then go.

229
00:15:28,227 --> 00:15:30,286
I'm gone.

230
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:33,992
-Which one do I get?
-You, Philly?

231
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:36,190
Show me the booty.

232
00:15:39,471 --> 00:15:41,701
I'd start right there.

233
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:44,401
Canapé?

234
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,077
No, thanks.

235
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:55,378
Whatever it 's worth, I had
nothing to do with that bare ass.

236
00:15:55,587 --> 00:15:57,282
They're your friends, aren't they?

237
00:15:57,489 --> 00:15:59,047
Well, no.

238
00:15:59,758 --> 00:16:02,124
Those guys?
They just gave me a ride.

239
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:04,421
Actually, I'm here ala carte.

240
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:06,054
How about you?

241
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:08,597
I have a boyfriend.

242
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:11,266
-Great.
-Price Hurly.

243
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:15,106
Price Hurly? The guy in all
the underwear commercials?

244
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:17,571
And billboards
and magazines and...

245
00:16:18,744 --> 00:16:21,235
Must be a big deal
dating someone that famous.

246
00:16:21,447 --> 00:16:23,142
Oh, no.
We're not going out.

247
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:25,544
-You're not?
-No. Haven't even met him yet.

248
00:16:25,751 --> 00:16:27,878
-But you just said...
-I will.

249
00:16:28,087 --> 00:16:31,921
Price and I are like destined to be
together, you know? It's like fate.

250
00:16:32,257 --> 00:16:35,090
And that is why
I am saving myself.

251
00:16:36,362 --> 00:16:38,455
Refill?

252
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:39,653
The "Law of Man":

253
00:16:39,865 --> 00:16:44,529
If she slams the door in your face,
never, ever fetch her a drink.

254
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:49,471
Somebody stop this guy.

255
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:54,773
-Hey.
-Hi.

256
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:58,946
-I'm Phil.
-I am Ann.

257
00:17:01,453 --> 00:17:03,978
-You got an accent...
-That's because...

258
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:07,090
Don't even tell me.
You're from Spain.

259
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,088
-No, I'm...
-Sweden?

260
00:17:09,294 --> 00:17:10,989
-No.
-Canada.

261
00:17:11,296 --> 00:17:12,456
I'm from here.

262
00:17:12,731 --> 00:17:15,461
Well, maybe you should learn
to like, talk better.

263
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:18,632
I'm deaf, you stupid idiot!

264
00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:34,742
-Thank you.
-Cheers.

265
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:37,415
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

266
00:17:37,623 --> 00:17:40,615
Do you happen to know
the Latin name for that bush?

267
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,357
That 's amazing.

268
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:49,564
It's not polite to steal without
offering something to a lady.

269
00:17:52,104 --> 00:17:53,469
Sure.

270
00:17:54,973 --> 00:17:56,634
You're the best man,
aren't you?

271
00:17:56,842 --> 00:17:59,606
-How'd you know that?
-Because I'm the Maid of Honor.

272
00:17:59,812 --> 00:18:01,143
Tanya.

273
00:18:01,547 --> 00:18:04,641
I've heard some
very bad things about you.

274
00:18:04,883 --> 00:18:06,942
Like what kind
of bad things?

275
00:18:08,887 --> 00:18:10,787
Things that would scare off
any Maid of Honor.

276
00:18:10,989 --> 00:18:12,980
But you're not just
your average Maid of Honor.

277
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:17,285
Honor's over-rated.
Unlike a good cigar.

278
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:20,191
Okay.

279
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:29,869
Last month, I did Metallica's
sound check at the Fillmore.

280
00:18:30,075 --> 00:18:32,543
-That was a pretty big deal.
-Really?

281
00:18:32,744 --> 00:18:35,178
-My Mom owns the Fillmore.
-She does?

282
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:38,110
-And Arroya Beach.
-The whole beach?

283
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:41,650
Except for the part they made us
donate near the sewage plant.

284
00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:43,549
It wasn't like,
a big loss or anything.

285
00:18:43,755 --> 00:18:46,223
Especially after they found
that yucky bacteria stuff...

286
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:49,325
on people's skin.
I heard it was flesh eating...

287
00:19:00,072 --> 00:19:02,040
Oh. My God.

288
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:08,307
-My Pradas.
-I'm sorry. I've have to...

289
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:10,175
go.

290
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,151
Dew.

291
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:19,719
-That Tanya isn't with you, is she?
-Did you see who just walked in here?

292
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:22,189
She comprehends
the deepest part of my soul.

293
00:19:22,394 --> 00:19:24,191
Look over there by the stairs.

294
00:19:26,231 --> 00:19:29,098
-You are sick, bro'.
-No, the girl.

295
00:19:29,368 --> 00:19:31,427
Don't you remember?
It's Reese.

296
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:33,502
You were into a Reese
in high school, weren't you?

297
00:19:33,705 --> 00:19:36,572
Only the whole way through junior
year. We were like this big deal.

298
00:19:36,775 --> 00:19:39,107
Her Mom even let me stay over.

299
00:19:39,311 --> 00:19:41,802
-So what is she doing here?
-I have no idea.

300
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:48,547
Scottie's marrying your
high school bitch. Look at...

301
00:19:48,754 --> 00:19:50,984
Reese, Teresa... duh!

302
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:54,119
Oh, crap, here they come.
What do I do?

303
00:19:54,326 --> 00:19:56,487
-You didn't nail her, did you?
-I'm not even gonna go there.

304
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:58,458
Ah, you didn't.
Unclench your anal chute, bro'.

305
00:19:58,664 --> 00:20:01,758
What if she says something to me?
What if her Mom recognizes me?

306
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:05,403
I would like you to meet
my future wife.

307
00:20:05,604 --> 00:20:07,970
-Hi, I'm Teresa.
-Dewey.

308
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:12,170
I'm so glad you guys
could be here.

309
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:15,005
I wouldn't miss this for anything.

310
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,476
Jay?

311
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:19,582
The rapture of flight
is such a fragile gift.

312
00:20:19,785 --> 00:20:20,809
Okay.

313
00:20:21,286 --> 00:20:22,412
Jay...

314
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:30,324
-Hello.
-Nice to meet you, Jay.

315
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:33,394
Wait a second.
You guys already know each other?

316
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:37,466
-You mean before now? No.
-Not at all.

317
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:39,795
Because that would mean we...

318
00:20:40,005 --> 00:20:42,997
would recognize each other
and that is not the case.

319
00:20:44,142 --> 00:20:46,667
So, when do we get
to meet Mom?

320
00:20:49,047 --> 00:20:52,210
-She passed away.
-Thank God.

321
00:20:55,187 --> 00:20:59,180
-Thank God your mother's dead?
-The whole thing's no big deal.

322
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:01,985
-Just tell Scotty.
-Tell him what?

323
00:21:02,194 --> 00:21:04,355
That I spent all junior year
feeling up his wife?

324
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,488
Well...
Take it easy, chief.

325
00:21:06,698 --> 00:21:09,223
Not exactly what you call
the perfect wedding gift.

326
00:21:09,468 --> 00:21:10,594
Are you going to pout
all weekend...

327
00:21:10,802 --> 00:21:12,497
or are you going to suit up
for some cave diving?

328
00:21:12,704 --> 00:21:16,037
Don't you worry.
I have the situation under control.

329
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:19,301
-Who's it gonna be?
-You'll see.

330
00:21:19,678 --> 00:21:21,077
Come on, tell me.

331
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,247
Brooke, okay?

332
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:24,915
The stuck-up chick?

333
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:28,848
She's gonna rip open your sack
and fry your nads for breakfast.

334
00:21:29,054 --> 00:21:32,387
-Yeah? We'll see about that.
-I am so gonna love your sister.

335
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,922
Don't make me warn you again.

336
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:37,118
Come on, Phil.
Jump up. Try on your tux.

337
00:21:37,329 --> 00:21:39,820
-I ain't doing this.
-What are you talking about?

338
00:21:40,032 --> 00:21:41,659
I'm no groomsman.
I'm not even a man.

339
00:21:41,867 --> 00:21:45,359
Will you grow a spine? We all
get shot down once in a while.

340
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:49,371
-In sign language?
-No, stick, baby.

341
00:21:49,574 --> 00:21:51,633
Wax on, wax off.

342
00:21:52,077 --> 00:21:54,409
That's it!
You're toast, "Mary".

343
00:21:56,848 --> 00:21:58,509
Psycho!

344
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:05,281
Jay.
That chick Melodie...

345
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:08,357
Didn't you tell me she has
a hard-on for Price Hurly?

346
00:22:09,528 --> 00:22:12,964
And doesn't he always kind
of hide his face like that?

347
00:22:13,365 --> 00:22:14,764
That's right.

348
00:22:19,071 --> 00:22:22,438
No way, Dew. There's no way
he could pull it off.

349
00:22:22,908 --> 00:22:25,172
-Oh, yeah.
-Pull what off?

350
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:34,913
-Hell, yeah.
-He does kind of look like him.

351
00:22:35,153 --> 00:22:38,680
Look at this.
I am wearing a Kotex in my ass.

352
00:22:39,157 --> 00:22:41,455
What's the point of working out
if you're never gonna use it?

353
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:44,254
But I don't have those piercings.
I mean, look at the man's nipple.

354
00:22:44,563 --> 00:22:47,726
I promise it only hurts for,
like, a second.

355
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:49,261
You no move.

356
00:22:52,471 --> 00:22:54,336
Is that thing even sharp?

357
00:22:54,573 --> 00:22:55,870
Am I bleeding?

358
00:22:56,074 --> 00:22:59,066
It says here Price likes
cigarette boats, sushi...

359
00:22:59,344 --> 00:23:02,245
...and Ethiopian women.
-Let me see that.

360
00:23:04,149 --> 00:23:06,117
All right, Phil, try this.

361
00:23:06,318 --> 00:23:09,253
"Yeah, man, I'm so over
that whole Milan freak show".

362
00:23:09,654 --> 00:23:11,645
-Yeah, man. I'm so...
-No, no, no.

363
00:23:12,157 --> 00:23:16,651
Look, you've got to make it real.
Just, "Yeah, man". Chill.

364
00:23:16,862 --> 00:23:21,492
Yeah, man. That freak show thing
is so over, baby.

365
00:23:21,767 --> 00:23:23,894
Yeah, that's it, see?

366
00:23:25,771 --> 00:23:29,434
Jesus!
It wasn't even numb yet.

367
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:32,105
No refund.
I do nipple now.

368
00:23:33,612 --> 00:23:36,604
My nipple? Wait, man.
Will l lose sensitivity?

369
00:23:37,516 --> 00:23:39,609
Will I lose sensitivity?

370
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:43,721
-I'll catch up with you guys later.
-Where you going, Jay?

371
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:46,587
To win a bet.

372
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:49,852
Hey, I changed my mind.

373
00:23:50,061 --> 00:23:52,393
I changed my mind.
I changed my mind, Dewey.

374
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:58,793
I do over, no charge.

375
00:24:06,545 --> 00:24:09,309
Hey, Brooke, right?
What are you doing here?

376
00:24:09,581 --> 00:24:12,448
Some last minute
wedding shopping.

377
00:24:12,651 --> 00:24:14,676
Really?
Me, too.

378
00:24:15,086 --> 00:24:18,522
God, I am running a total blank
on the whole gift ideas thing.

379
00:24:18,723 --> 00:24:20,850
You mind if I tag along?

380
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:23,050
As long as you're not gonna
try to hit on me.

381
00:24:23,261 --> 00:24:25,695
Me? No, I wouldn't even...

382
00:24:33,205 --> 00:24:35,002
That shoe would look good
on your foot.

383
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,978
Cool tattoo. I love that.

384
00:24:44,249 --> 00:24:45,773
I'm actually thinking
about getting a shark...

385
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:49,010
with a human leg stuck
in its teeth.

386
00:24:49,221 --> 00:24:51,746
Why do I get the feeling
you're hitting on me?

387
00:24:51,957 --> 00:24:55,358
You think I'm hitting on you?
Well, that's really...

388
00:24:57,662 --> 00:24:59,721
A "half-caf' mocha
chocolate cappuccino".

389
00:24:59,931 --> 00:25:01,796
-Sure thing.
-Jay...

390
00:25:02,033 --> 00:25:03,660
I don't date.

391
00:25:03,869 --> 00:25:05,769
Oh, I don't date either.

392
00:25:05,971 --> 00:25:08,735
It's really amazing how many
things we have in common.

393
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:12,239
I don't date because I like sex.

394
00:25:12,644 --> 00:25:15,112
You see? Right there.
So do I.

395
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:18,647
No, you know, I mean,
I really like sex.

396
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:21,978
-Me, too.
-So much that I can never have it.

397
00:25:22,654 --> 00:25:23,951
Sorry?

398
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:29,219
Sertraline...
It impairs my sex drive.

399
00:25:29,427 --> 00:25:31,827
If I don't take this,
I'm a very different person.

400
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,759
An animal,
a pleasure-seeking predator...

401
00:25:33,965 --> 00:25:36,365
who savages people
for my own gratification.

402
00:25:36,601 --> 00:25:38,000
Me, too.

403
00:25:40,238 --> 00:25:42,229
Did you ever kill someone?

404
00:25:44,643 --> 00:25:46,634
What do you mean?

405
00:25:46,945 --> 00:25:50,142
Three years ago
I was seeing my French professor.

406
00:25:51,149 --> 00:25:53,208
You sure
you want to hear this?

407
00:25:53,485 --> 00:25:56,386
Yeah, I don't got
anything better to do.

408
00:25:57,489 --> 00:25:59,753
It was noon.
Two hours...

409
00:25:59,958 --> 00:26:02,518
since I had sex
with the food service guy.

410
00:26:02,861 --> 00:26:05,796
<i>Excuse me</i>.
<i>May I pet your cat?</i>

411
00:26:10,435 --> 00:26:12,801
By the time I got
to Doctor Devereaux's office...

412
00:26:13,004 --> 00:26:16,201
-I was like a crazed tiger.
-You're like a crazed tiger!

413
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:19,468
<i>I was a pent-up volcano</i>
<i>and nothing was gonna stop me</i>.

414
00:26:19,778 --> 00:26:22,212
Slow down!
I cannot breathe!

415
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:24,245
<i>The fur is very soft</i>.

416
00:26:27,018 --> 00:26:28,315
"Si vous plait!"

417
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:31,318
I need my medication.
My inhaler!

418
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:33,690
<i>I was so busy</i>
<i>pleasuring myself</i>...

419
00:26:33,892 --> 00:26:36,884
I just assumed he was getting off.
So, I just kept at it.

420
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:38,824
One hour. Three hours.

421
00:26:39,064 --> 00:26:43,091
<i>Who was keeping track?</i>
<i>I never noticed a thing until</i>...

422
00:26:46,972 --> 00:26:49,133
You mean, he could still...

423
00:26:49,341 --> 00:26:53,539
Rigor mortis. Which is why
I can never have sex again.

424
00:27:00,085 --> 00:27:02,246
Now, I already have
ten thousand subscribers.

425
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:05,753
Your investment would take us
to half a mil' in six months, easy.

426
00:27:05,991 --> 00:27:09,791
A year later we are talking
major IPO slots.

427
00:27:09,995 --> 00:27:11,428
What do you mean she's psycho?

428
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:14,394
She has to take pills
to stay balanced.

429
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:16,066
You mean, like a squirrel?

430
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:19,634
No, not like a squirrel.
Mentally, right?

431
00:27:19,838 --> 00:27:22,898
-She's a sexual predator.
-That is hot.

432
00:27:23,108 --> 00:27:26,043
-She killed a guy.
-Dude, that is so hot.

433
00:27:26,611 --> 00:27:29,910
-I don't see your breasts.
-Sorry, I...

434
00:27:30,115 --> 00:27:35,178
You get on a plane and they serve
you chicken in those little trays.

435
00:27:35,754 --> 00:27:38,450
Who do you think thought up
the idea to grow chickens...

436
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:40,852
with breasts that small?

437
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,821
-You.
-Yes.

438
00:27:47,866 --> 00:27:50,960
How am I supposed to get anywhere
with any of these chicks?

439
00:27:51,202 --> 00:27:53,466
There are other fishes
in the sea, my friend.

440
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:56,266
Oh, yeah? You mean,
like Tanya, who wants you...

441
00:27:56,474 --> 00:27:59,966
or Melodie, who's holding out
for the Price Hurly fairy.

442
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:02,772
Look, if you can't handle
Level Two, don't play the game.

443
00:28:03,081 --> 00:28:04,241
Dew...

444
00:28:04,482 --> 00:28:06,450
...you gotta let me slide.
-No, no.

445
00:28:06,651 --> 00:28:09,950
-You are not punking on this bet.
-I don't have a chance in hell.

446
00:28:10,755 --> 00:28:12,382
Then pay up.

447
00:28:13,558 --> 00:28:15,048
Goodbye!

448
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,527
Susie!
What are you doing here?

449
00:28:24,736 --> 00:28:27,204
I had a recital in Ventura
and Pastor Frank dropped me off.

450
00:28:27,405 --> 00:28:28,497
Hi, Dewey!

451
00:28:29,307 --> 00:28:31,298
But you weren't supposed
to come until the wedding.

452
00:28:31,509 --> 00:28:32,874
I know. But I thought
the best gift...

453
00:28:33,078 --> 00:28:34,978
I could give Scott
would be the gift of fellowship.

454
00:28:50,962 --> 00:28:52,987
Let's start with rehearsal,
shall we?

455
00:28:56,401 --> 00:29:00,201
There's something you need
to know about Scott's fiancée.

456
00:29:00,505 --> 00:29:03,167
Suz! No way!
I can't believe it!

457
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:04,807
Hi there, Scotty!

458
00:29:06,878 --> 00:29:10,405
Come here. I wanna you meet someone
I had a crush on in college.

459
00:29:10,615 --> 00:29:13,641
-This is Jay's sister, Susie.
-Hey, aren't you...

460
00:29:16,187 --> 00:29:18,382
-But...
-The minister's waiting.

461
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:21,286
He's got a lot of things to bless,
so why don't we catch up later?

462
00:29:21,526 --> 00:29:24,518
Fabulous idea.
Ladies to the left...

463
00:29:24,729 --> 00:29:26,390
gents to the right.

464
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:30,659
-Jay, Scotty's marrying...
-Reese, I know. But he doesn't know.

465
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:32,527
He doesn't know
you guys were together?

466
00:29:32,737 --> 00:29:34,671
No, and I'd just assume
he never finds out.

467
00:29:36,074 --> 00:29:39,601
-You're protecting her virtue.
-What?

468
00:29:39,811 --> 00:29:41,711
Oh, yeah, that.

469
00:29:44,082 --> 00:29:46,642
All right,
we'll start with the vows.

470
00:29:57,495 --> 00:30:00,555
-What the hell is he doing?
-Ah, just roll with it.

471
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:10,467
Is that who I think it is?

472
00:30:17,949 --> 00:30:19,473
Hey, what's up, man?
All right.

473
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:24,978
Let's nail this bitch!

474
00:30:28,393 --> 00:30:30,156
Thank you.

475
00:30:30,628 --> 00:30:32,619
Come here, you.

476
00:30:47,712 --> 00:30:49,646
The Price man is here.
Who wants to unwrap...

477
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:51,611
some of this
semi-sweet chocolate?

478
00:30:51,816 --> 00:30:55,445
You can't just park here like that,
man. They gonna come and...

479
00:30:55,887 --> 00:30:58,287
-This is Wilt Chamberlain's car.
-In the flesh.

480
00:30:58,489 --> 00:30:59,615
Hell, man, just leave it
right there...

481
00:30:59,824 --> 00:31:02,759
'cause there ain't nobody
touching "The Dipper's" ride.

482
00:31:03,828 --> 00:31:06,126
You heard the man.

483
00:31:17,642 --> 00:31:21,840
You'll remember this moment when
riding back from the strip club.

484
00:31:24,749 --> 00:31:27,877
-Easy on the drinks, okay, Suz?
-And that was that.

485
00:31:28,253 --> 00:31:31,017
But then why pretend to be
that Phil guy?

486
00:31:31,856 --> 00:31:33,619
-Well, you see...
-Baby.

487
00:31:33,825 --> 00:31:34,951
Baby.

488
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:39,594
Price's to cope out the scene first.
'cause if I don't go "incog-negro"...

489
00:31:39,797 --> 00:31:42,129
the media's gonna be
all over me.

490
00:31:42,433 --> 00:31:44,526
So that's why
you didn't bring Kirsten?

491
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:46,533
-Who?
-Girlfriend.

492
00:31:46,771 --> 00:31:49,103
-Oh, girlfriend Kirsten?
-Yeah.

493
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,431
She is history.

494
00:31:52,443 --> 00:31:53,842
Really?
What happened?

495
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:57,142
She died...

496
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:01,444
While we were racing
cigarette boats.

497
00:32:01,653 --> 00:32:03,314
I did not know that you were
in a boating accident.

498
00:32:03,521 --> 00:32:05,648
-I almost lost a testicle.
-Another one?

499
00:32:05,857 --> 00:32:08,951
-Say what?
-Didn't you already have one removed?

500
00:32:09,494 --> 00:32:10,893
Five years ago.

501
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:14,155
Yeah, five years ago.
But it grew back.

502
00:32:14,499 --> 00:32:19,664
I was part of
a major medical situation...

503
00:32:20,571 --> 00:32:23,062
where they took fibers from
my triceps area...

504
00:32:23,308 --> 00:32:27,301
and they fused it in this region,
making it more pronounced.

505
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:31,541
The correct medical terminology
for what I have is called...

506
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:34,283
"tri-sticles".

507
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:36,716
Tri-sticles...

508
00:32:37,989 --> 00:32:39,616
I'd like to say something.

509
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:43,260
A couple of weeks ago,
I'd not have dreamed...

510
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:45,452
that someone like Teresa
would wanna be my wife.

511
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:47,924
The whole thing
has been amazing.

512
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:51,033
My only regret is that
I'll never get to meet her Mom.

513
00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:53,430
Jesus, dude!
Suck the life out of the room.

514
00:32:53,671 --> 00:32:56,868
But I have gotten to know
Mister Shatwell.

515
00:32:57,275 --> 00:33:01,905
I wanna thank him for the generosity
that he has shown the both of us.

516
00:33:02,847 --> 00:33:06,874
So I realize this might seem
a bit premature but...

517
00:33:07,085 --> 00:33:09,610
seeing as we're
practically married anyhow...

518
00:33:11,889 --> 00:33:13,413
It's a Rolex, Sir.

519
00:33:13,624 --> 00:33:17,390
It's a small token
of what your daughter means to me.

520
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:20,722
Well, that's
very thoughtful, son.

521
00:33:34,712 --> 00:33:37,010
See something you like?

522
00:33:39,384 --> 00:33:42,046
The napkins.
They're little swans.

523
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,550
You are so gonna lose
this bet.

524
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:49,285
Yeah.
We'll just see about that.

525
00:33:56,834 --> 00:33:58,699
What is it about weddings?

526
00:33:58,903 --> 00:34:00,131
What do you mean?

527
00:34:00,338 --> 00:34:04,104
Well, don't you think being
here is kid of, I don't know... Erotic?

528
00:34:04,308 --> 00:34:06,173
-Yes.
-Me neither.

529
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:08,311
-You do?
-Definitely.

530
00:34:08,513 --> 00:34:10,003
That's... that's good.

531
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:12,512
Which makes me wonder
why your friend is avoiding me.

532
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:15,083
-My friend?
-Dewey.

533
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:18,045
-You mean like this?
-Oh, no.

534
00:34:18,423 --> 00:34:20,584
You gotta be much more casual.

535
00:34:21,025 --> 00:34:23,323
I was told
he is "sexually advanced".

536
00:34:23,528 --> 00:34:25,120
-He is. But...
-Then why does he scurry off...

537
00:34:25,329 --> 00:34:27,695
...like a frightened cockroach?
-Because...

538
00:34:28,766 --> 00:34:30,700
because he needs my guidance.

539
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:32,964
-You?
-It's true.

540
00:34:33,204 --> 00:34:36,264
I like to stay in the background,
slip him helpful hints...

541
00:34:36,474 --> 00:34:39,068
erogenous zones, "g" spots,
that sort of thing.

542
00:34:39,277 --> 00:34:41,768
Dewey thinks of me
like a "sexual savant".

543
00:34:42,847 --> 00:34:45,372
No, seriously.
Doesn't he like me?

544
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:49,652
Oh, no, the Lord's in a church.
You're so funny!

545
00:34:50,888 --> 00:34:54,654
Yes, he does.
But he has this condition.

546
00:34:54,859 --> 00:34:55,917
What condition?

547
00:34:56,127 --> 00:34:59,096
The kind guys don't like
to usually talk about.

548
00:34:59,297 --> 00:35:00,355
How sad.

549
00:35:00,565 --> 00:35:03,557
Well... I try to tell him.

550
00:35:03,868 --> 00:35:06,860
The right woman can make
all the difference...

551
00:35:07,472 --> 00:35:09,133
but does he listen?

552
00:35:10,007 --> 00:35:13,773
I got this new perfume on
especially for the wedding.

553
00:35:14,178 --> 00:35:15,270
Smell me. Smell me.

554
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:19,606
-Is that holy water?
-Lose?

555
00:35:20,084 --> 00:35:21,949
I don't think so.

556
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:25,923
-I am so sorry. Here...
-Look at me.

557
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:28,684
-Am I a klutz?
-Let me help you.

558
00:35:28,893 --> 00:35:30,588
It's my fault.
My God.

559
00:35:36,033 --> 00:35:37,830
So, uh, how you been?

560
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:40,468
Me? God, life is great.

561
00:35:40,771 --> 00:35:43,239
-Same here.
-Yeah, I know. You and Scott.

562
00:35:43,441 --> 00:35:46,376
-I mean, what are the odds?
-Small world I guess.

563
00:35:46,711 --> 00:35:48,736
Jay, look.

564
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:52,477
I know it's been a long time
but I still feel terrible.

565
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:54,479
Hey, we were kids.

566
00:35:54,685 --> 00:35:57,586
Yeah, but I at least
should have said goodbye.

567
00:35:57,788 --> 00:35:58,846
I'm over it.

568
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:02,956
Then there's no reason
why we shouldn't tell Scott the truth.

569
00:36:03,694 --> 00:36:05,184
You want to tell Scott?

570
00:36:05,396 --> 00:36:08,388
He'll probably get
a good laugh out of it.

571
00:36:08,966 --> 00:36:11,230
-He probably will, you know?
-Then it's decided.

572
00:36:11,435 --> 00:36:14,302
-We will tell Scott.
-Tell me what?

573
00:36:14,772 --> 00:36:18,435
-We were just discussing the...
-The bachelor party.

574
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:21,210
What about it?

575
00:36:21,879 --> 00:36:22,903
Well?

576
00:36:23,114 --> 00:36:26,811
That a donkey show
would be way out of line.

577
00:36:27,818 --> 00:36:29,843
I think you're lying.

578
00:36:31,122 --> 00:36:33,613
I think you're fuckin' my wife.

579
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:39,924
Dude...

580
00:36:40,131 --> 00:36:41,996
change your name to "Gilligan".

581
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:54,171
Going some place?

582
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:56,436
To see Brooke.

583
00:36:57,081 --> 00:36:59,606
It's three A.M., bro'.
She's asleep.

584
00:36:59,817 --> 00:37:03,048
-That's what I'm counting on.
-You guys talking about me?

585
00:37:03,254 --> 00:37:06,621
Give it up, bro'. The chick is
on some nasty-ass pharmaceuticals.

586
00:37:07,024 --> 00:37:10,721
Was on some nasty-ass
pharmaceuticals.

587
00:37:10,928 --> 00:37:13,726
<i>A shocking abuse of</i>
<i>"The Law of Man".</i>

588
00:37:13,931 --> 00:37:15,728
<i>This should stop right here.</i>

589
00:37:16,534 --> 00:37:19,196
Don't even move.
I am so there for this.

590
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:21,003
Me too.

591
00:37:23,174 --> 00:37:24,266
What are we doing again?

592
00:37:33,884 --> 00:37:36,011
Check it out. Fish.

593
00:37:36,721 --> 00:37:37,983
Phil...

594
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:40,955
I'll come back here
with some bait.

595
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:48,456
Okay, Phil, be our eyes out here.
Be the bush.

596
00:37:48,666 --> 00:37:50,657
Dewey, you're with me.

597
00:37:50,901 --> 00:37:53,734
Oh, so butch.
I'm getting all tingly.

598
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:58,139
Hey. What bush?

599
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:14,451
What was that?

600
00:38:16,594 --> 00:38:18,255
Pig dooky.

601
00:38:20,364 --> 00:38:22,457
Oh, it's the nut-job
and her swine.

602
00:38:23,668 --> 00:38:24,828
Go.

603
00:38:47,858 --> 00:38:50,383
Gotta be Reese's room.
Where is she?

604
00:38:50,594 --> 00:38:54,257
-Probably off smoking Scotty's pole.
-Bite me.

605
00:39:05,076 --> 00:39:07,772
Be the bush.
Be the bush.

606
00:39:08,279 --> 00:39:11,271
Say, I wonder what they do
to underwear models in prison?

607
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:16,885
Well, of course you like it.
I knew you would.

608
00:39:17,288 --> 00:39:20,189
And that is why I put it on.

609
00:39:22,293 --> 00:39:23,783
Oh baby,
your taste is so evolved.

610
00:39:23,994 --> 00:39:27,395
For the record,
I am not a "peeping tom".

611
00:39:27,832 --> 00:39:29,129
Just this one time.

612
00:39:32,169 --> 00:39:34,899
It's only two thousand dollars
from Paris.

613
00:39:36,474 --> 00:39:38,339
Stop that, Price.

614
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:40,475
Stop that.

615
00:39:41,145 --> 00:39:43,613
Price. You're being so bad.

616
00:39:43,814 --> 00:39:47,978
Oh, yeah, baby.
Your bad boy is right here.

617
00:39:56,761 --> 00:39:58,456
This is it.
Cover the hall.

618
00:39:58,662 --> 00:40:00,721
Give me five minutes
to make the switch.

619
00:40:00,931 --> 00:40:02,626
-Hey, wait.
-What?

620
00:40:02,833 --> 00:40:04,733
Anything goes wrong...

621
00:40:05,269 --> 00:40:06,463
cap her.

622
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:09,764
-With paintball?
-This shit hurts.

623
00:40:17,314 --> 00:40:19,839
Keep dreaming.

624
00:40:30,861 --> 00:40:31,953
Well...

625
00:40:32,696 --> 00:40:34,493
Did someone get lonely?

626
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,198
Price, I really loved
your last catalog.

627
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:42,496
Wait till you get your hands
on the real thing.

628
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:45,004
I just knew that
we were meant to be together...

629
00:40:45,209 --> 00:40:48,076
when I saw you on page nineteen
riding that stallion.

630
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:52,215
Soon, I'll be riding you,
my little "hump-a-chu".

631
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:58,850
I may be going to hell
for this...

632
00:40:59,056 --> 00:41:01,217
but somebody's gonna be eating
their words on Monday.

633
00:41:05,329 --> 00:41:07,593
What is all this crap?

634
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:15,503
If I can't close
a one-night stand, think again.

635
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:25,442
-Are you going to stand there?
-I'm not allowed to do anything else.

636
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:28,311
Oh, it's okay.
You don't have to pretend with me.

637
00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:31,085
-Pretend?
-I know all about it.

638
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:36,048
-Any other time and I...
-Plenty of men have the same problem.

639
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,622
Problem?

640
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:40,490
Whoa, do you think, do you think?
I do not have "pecker-pucker".

641
00:41:40,698 --> 00:41:42,256
Then there is another reason
you don't want me.

642
00:41:42,466 --> 00:41:43,626
Well, as a matter of fact, um...

643
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:45,699
-You prefer schoolgirls?
-No.

644
00:41:45,903 --> 00:41:47,234
-Schoolboys?
-No!

645
00:41:48,873 --> 00:41:52,070
Then I guess
you're just shit out of excuses.

646
00:41:58,549 --> 00:42:02,883
I want us to be together forever,
and forever and forever.

647
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:04,346
I mean forever.

648
00:42:04,555 --> 00:42:06,580
I don't know about
all those "forevers".

649
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:09,054
But I'd like to hit it
a couple of times.

650
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:13,720
-And you'd never leave me?
-Baby, I ain't going nowhere.

651
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:16,192
You can count on it.

652
00:42:38,255 --> 00:42:41,190
Pepper?
Pepper...

653
00:42:48,198 --> 00:42:51,099
How much stuff you brought
for one stupid wedding.

654
00:42:53,537 --> 00:42:55,835
Come on, pills,
where are you?

655
00:43:07,051 --> 00:43:08,313
Sertraline...

656
00:43:09,153 --> 00:43:11,621
this bet is over, my friend.

657
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:20,460
-Are you going to stop this nonsense?
-Oh, look, I really want to.

658
00:43:20,664 --> 00:43:23,599
-It's just that...
-That you're impotent. Admit it.

659
00:43:23,801 --> 00:43:24,825
No.

660
00:43:25,703 --> 00:43:28,695
Okay, yes, yes,
I can't pitch a tent.

661
00:43:28,939 --> 00:43:31,703
I'm a dickless she-male.
There, I said it.

662
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:33,239
Good.

663
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:35,935
Now we can begin
the road to recovery.

664
00:43:36,146 --> 00:43:39,206
-Pepper! Where are you?
-Oh, I gotta go.

665
00:43:52,062 --> 00:43:57,967
Dumb aspirin bottles
with their damn childproof caps...

666
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:05,775
Jay, we have to...

667
00:44:06,577 --> 00:44:07,805
Bad pig!

668
00:44:08,879 --> 00:44:11,177
That is so wrong,
it's right.

669
00:44:11,749 --> 00:44:14,183
-We've got to stop this.
-No time, bro'.

670
00:44:14,385 --> 00:44:16,819
-But she's...
-She's obviously digging it.

671
00:44:21,225 --> 00:44:22,590
-We've got to go back!
-Are you high?

672
00:44:22,793 --> 00:44:24,556
-I didn't make the switch.
-You had your chance.

673
00:44:24,762 --> 00:44:26,252
Look, I am not giving up.

674
00:44:27,931 --> 00:44:28,989
Phil?

675
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:33,435
You all right?

676
00:44:33,637 --> 00:44:36,765
-What happened, Phil? Talk to us.
-My chest feels funny.

677
00:44:38,709 --> 00:44:40,370
-Damn.
-What?

678
00:44:40,577 --> 00:44:42,477
-Oh, it's nothing.
-You said, "Damn".

679
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,375
No, I over-reacted.

680
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:49,046
-What?
-He's right. Don't worry about it.

681
00:44:49,253 --> 00:44:50,845
Tell me.

682
00:44:51,455 --> 00:44:54,481
-Phil, you're missing something.
-What do you mean?

683
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:57,160
-It's nothing big.
-What am I missing?

684
00:44:57,361 --> 00:44:58,760
Your nipple.

685
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:03,796
-My nipple's missing?
-Relax. I can do a field suture.

686
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:05,763
Keep him away from me, man.
My nipple's missing!

687
00:45:05,969 --> 00:45:07,436
Don't be such a wuss!

688
00:45:07,638 --> 00:45:11,233
Dude, why don't you take him
to the emergency room...

689
00:45:11,909 --> 00:45:15,208
and I'll look for the nipple
and I'll meet you there.

690
00:45:15,412 --> 00:45:18,404
Okay, but I could do the work
for a lot cheaper. Come on.

691
00:45:19,683 --> 00:45:22,516
-Please find my nipple.
-Get up, get up.

692
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:26,178
Lots of guys lead
productive lives with one nipple.

693
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:29,987
Pepper, Mommy's looking for you.

694
00:45:30,661 --> 00:45:31,889
Pepper!

695
00:45:34,865 --> 00:45:37,629
There it is.
No, it's a snail.

696
00:46:05,629 --> 00:46:07,961
I wasn't spying out there, really.

697
00:46:09,299 --> 00:46:11,733
I know exactly
what you were doing.

698
00:46:11,935 --> 00:46:13,197
You do?

699
00:46:15,405 --> 00:46:19,068
-I made this bet with Dewey...
-Paintball at five in the morning?

700
00:46:19,743 --> 00:46:21,438
You never grew up, did you?

701
00:46:23,914 --> 00:46:25,245
I guess not.

702
00:46:27,151 --> 00:46:29,779
Well, as long as you're here.

703
00:46:32,356 --> 00:46:34,017
What are you doing?

704
00:46:34,658 --> 00:46:36,319
Well, I have to dance
with Scott tomorrow...

705
00:46:36,527 --> 00:46:39,291
but I suck like you
wouldn't believe.

706
00:46:40,831 --> 00:46:43,732
And I'm supposed to improve
the situation?

707
00:46:45,702 --> 00:46:47,067
What's so funny?

708
00:46:47,271 --> 00:46:50,035
Do you remember
the last time we did this?

709
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:52,434
-No.
-Yes, you do.

710
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:55,737
Junior Prom at the Hyatt,
last dance...

711
00:46:55,946 --> 00:46:57,413
Bee Gee's
"You're My Everything".

712
00:46:57,614 --> 00:47:00,515
I dribbled beer on your dress and
shoes, that's all I remember.

713
00:47:01,718 --> 00:47:06,178
-Right before I moved.
-That's right...You moved!

714
00:47:06,390 --> 00:47:09,359
Yeah. Mom got re-married
and we had to go.

715
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:12,222
I couldn't say goodbye
to any of my friends.

716
00:47:14,198 --> 00:47:16,223
I figured it was
something like that.

717
00:47:16,533 --> 00:47:22,062
It wasn't anything like that. I tried
to call you every day for a year but...

718
00:47:22,272 --> 00:47:26,971
...I thought you hated me.
-Hated you? No.

719
00:47:27,177 --> 00:47:29,372
Disappointed, yeah.

720
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:31,275
Mom always said
we were good together.

721
00:47:31,481 --> 00:47:33,949
She'd be happy you were here.

722
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:38,519
Well, you have Scott now, so
everything turned out for the best.

723
00:47:38,722 --> 00:47:41,623
-Scott's great.
-Dependable, too.

724
00:47:41,825 --> 00:47:44,487
-You'd not find a better husband.
-Or friend.

725
00:47:51,401 --> 00:47:55,303
Oh, shit! The nipple.
Oh, God. No! No, bad pig! Bad pig!

726
00:47:55,505 --> 00:47:56,733
-What's he got?
-Bad cheese.

727
00:47:56,940 --> 00:47:58,874
It'll kill a pig this small.

728
00:48:07,951 --> 00:48:10,146
You're going down, "Tiny".

729
00:48:15,259 --> 00:48:16,726
You are so bacon.

730
00:48:26,436 --> 00:48:27,994
Give me that nipple, pig!

731
00:48:32,609 --> 00:48:34,099
You lose, pig!

732
00:48:41,385 --> 00:48:42,852
God!

733
00:48:53,363 --> 00:48:55,354
Hell of a shot, Sir. Good eye.

734
00:48:55,565 --> 00:48:57,897
-Damn!
-I could do that.

735
00:48:58,335 --> 00:49:00,132
Ah, it got away from me there.

736
00:49:00,737 --> 00:49:04,229
I think the wind caught it over
those trees out there...

737
00:49:04,441 --> 00:49:07,569
-Sit on a fork?
-I don't want to discuss it.

738
00:49:07,844 --> 00:49:11,075
It's a crying shame
you didn't switch those pills.

739
00:49:11,648 --> 00:49:15,209
Right about now Brooke
would be feeling that urge...

740
00:49:15,419 --> 00:49:18,820
that hunger down below that even
"pig-a-lingus" couldn't satisfy.

741
00:49:19,022 --> 00:49:20,319
Enough already.

742
00:49:21,024 --> 00:49:23,049
Well, no use crying over
spilt aspirins.

743
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:25,990
The good news is,
you didn't get caught.

744
00:49:27,531 --> 00:49:29,761
It would have upset
so many people.

745
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:33,296
Oh, that Dewey is the friendliest
boy I've ever met.

746
00:49:33,537 --> 00:49:35,732
Susie, I've been meaning
to thank you.

747
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:40,937
Oh, please. Helping others
is the road to rapture.

748
00:49:41,311 --> 00:49:44,940
No, I mean for not saying
anything to Scott.

749
00:49:45,315 --> 00:49:47,215
Well, that's none of my beeswax,
now is it?

750
00:49:47,451 --> 00:49:51,751
Well, seeing Jay again has made
things a little complicated.

751
00:49:51,955 --> 00:49:53,752
Well, you don't have
to explain to me.

752
00:49:58,195 --> 00:50:01,221
You'd shoot a lot straighter with
your head out of the man's ass.

753
00:50:06,703 --> 00:50:08,295
Pull!

754
00:50:09,539 --> 00:50:10,733
Oh, yeah!

755
00:50:15,112 --> 00:50:16,943
Ten o'clock?

756
00:50:19,116 --> 00:50:20,674
What?

757
00:50:21,051 --> 00:50:24,487
Oh, those pills are
five bucks each. Who did this?

758
00:50:26,156 --> 00:50:28,818
-I am gonna kill that pig.
-Pull!

759
00:50:33,563 --> 00:50:37,226
You're the man, Scott.
Show'em how it's done.

760
00:50:37,434 --> 00:50:38,662
Pull!

761
00:50:41,304 --> 00:50:42,771
Take that!

762
00:50:43,006 --> 00:50:45,531
-Give the best man some of that.
-You sure of this, tough guy?

763
00:50:45,909 --> 00:50:47,843
You know which end
to point to the sky?

764
00:50:48,045 --> 00:50:49,637
Launch that sucker!

765
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:54,210
Asswipe!

766
00:50:55,519 --> 00:50:57,749
It's all in how you lead
the target.

767
00:50:57,954 --> 00:50:59,945
That's good advice, Sir,
especially in business.

768
00:51:00,323 --> 00:51:03,121
-Oh, yes. Innovate or die.
-Well, I'm glad you feel that way...

769
00:51:03,326 --> 00:51:06,659
'cause I planned to launch as soon as
you make that twelve million available.

770
00:51:06,863 --> 00:51:11,027
Twelve million?
Scott, that's a piece of change.

771
00:51:11,268 --> 00:51:14,931
Any idea how many lasagna
and crackers I'd have to fly?

772
00:51:15,605 --> 00:51:19,132
Well, you have seen my profit
projections. They're bulletproof.

773
00:51:19,342 --> 00:51:21,936
Of course, if you need a day
or so to think about it...

774
00:51:23,413 --> 00:51:25,938
-Whore!
-Your grip's all cockeyed.

775
00:51:26,149 --> 00:51:27,844
Here, let me help you.

776
00:51:28,085 --> 00:51:30,781
Scott, don't take this the wrong
way, but what are you doing?

777
00:51:30,987 --> 00:51:32,978
-Everything's cool.
-You're hammering the guy.

778
00:51:33,223 --> 00:51:36,124
-It's not like he doesn't have it.
-Maybe, but shouldn't you wait...

779
00:51:36,326 --> 00:51:38,021
'till you marry Reese?

780
00:51:38,228 --> 00:51:40,128
-Who?
-Teresa.

781
00:51:40,330 --> 00:51:42,457
-No, you said "Reese".
-I'm sure I didn't.

782
00:51:42,666 --> 00:51:44,065
-No, you did.
-Whatever.

783
00:51:44,267 --> 00:51:47,259
I want to make sure that you'll
get married for the right reasons.

784
00:51:49,239 --> 00:51:50,331
Philly.

785
00:51:51,908 --> 00:51:53,170
How can you say
something like that?

786
00:51:53,376 --> 00:51:56,174
Maybe because all I'd be thinking
about is my future wife.

787
00:51:56,379 --> 00:51:59,974
Just hold on a second here. You mean
you can't tell how in love we are?

788
00:52:00,917 --> 00:52:03,818
-Well, I guess.
-That girl means everything to me.

789
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:07,613
And she feels exactly the same way.
If you don't believe, ask her.

790
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:09,482
No, it's not necessary.

791
00:52:09,926 --> 00:52:13,657
Look, Jay,
I know you're looking out for me...

792
00:52:13,997 --> 00:52:15,931
and I appreciate that.

793
00:52:16,133 --> 00:52:19,227
But don't you have
your own negotiations to close?

794
00:52:30,313 --> 00:52:32,076
Holy Mother of God.

795
00:52:47,097 --> 00:52:48,962
Your shooting woke me up.

796
00:52:49,366 --> 00:52:50,526
Sorry.

797
00:52:50,867 --> 00:52:52,835
It is pretty late.

798
00:52:53,069 --> 00:52:55,037
You know,
I didn't sleep very well.

799
00:52:55,639 --> 00:52:58,107
No? Why's that?

800
00:52:58,642 --> 00:53:00,906
-You.
-Me?

801
00:53:02,712 --> 00:53:07,274
I haven't treated you very nicely
and it was bothering me all night.

802
00:53:08,018 --> 00:53:10,919
And ever since I got up I've been
thinking how to make it better.

803
00:53:11,588 --> 00:53:13,579
You have?

804
00:53:13,790 --> 00:53:17,954
-What time's the bachelor part over?
-There's no last call or anything.

805
00:53:18,495 --> 00:53:21,987
Then why don't you come over say...

806
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:23,689
around one?

807
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:26,594
Yeah, sure, okay.

808
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:28,861
Don't keep me waiting.

809
00:53:32,108 --> 00:53:33,473
The birdies! Reese!

810
00:53:39,382 --> 00:53:40,508
Yes!

811
00:53:42,752 --> 00:53:45,118
That's what I'm talkin' about!

812
00:53:46,122 --> 00:53:48,784
What's for dinner, baby?!

813
00:54:02,372 --> 00:54:04,237
Welcome to Santa Barbara.
Not to worry...

814
00:54:04,441 --> 00:54:06,841
I've got you set up
for the whole weekend.

815
00:54:07,043 --> 00:54:08,908
Uncle Neal,
got your key right there.

816
00:54:09,379 --> 00:54:12,439
Yeah, Goldmans, there was no sweat
on that mid-size upgrade.

817
00:54:12,949 --> 00:54:16,976
Yeah, Bobby. Sorry,
they checked on your prior arrests.

818
00:54:17,287 --> 00:54:18,481
Take this to my car.

819
00:54:18,722 --> 00:54:20,917
I can get you a ride
with the Goldmans.

820
00:54:30,734 --> 00:54:32,429
I will take you down for this.

821
00:54:43,179 --> 00:54:45,773
-Look, last night...
-I was crazy.

822
00:54:45,982 --> 00:54:49,383
Yeah, I'm glad we didn't do something
we would have regretted.

823
00:54:49,586 --> 00:54:50,985
That's for sure.

824
00:54:52,355 --> 00:54:55,916
Anyway, I'm glad you
and Brooke like each other.

825
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:57,593
She's one of my best friends.

826
00:54:57,794 --> 00:55:02,254
Oh, yeah, Brooke, she's great.
She's real down to earth.

827
00:55:02,632 --> 00:55:06,932
Good, good.'Cause some guys
get put off by her freaky side.

828
00:55:07,170 --> 00:55:09,695
Oh, no, no. She told me
all about it. I'm fine with it.

829
00:55:09,906 --> 00:55:13,000
Yeah. You never know
with fetishes.

830
00:55:13,209 --> 00:55:14,540
Fetishes?

831
00:55:15,045 --> 00:55:17,240
I don't remember
her mentioning any...

832
00:55:17,447 --> 00:55:19,938
Yeah. Brooke's
not satisfied unless...

833
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:23,449
What am I saying?
Forget I even mentioned it.

834
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:27,419
-So what exactly is this fetish?
-Really. I can't.

835
00:55:27,924 --> 00:55:29,755
-Does she liked to get spanked?
-No.

836
00:55:29,959 --> 00:55:32,450
Handcuffs?
African-American dildos?

837
00:55:33,129 --> 00:55:36,860
I mean, she doesn't like to get
tinkled on or anything?

838
00:55:39,302 --> 00:55:42,328
Please, I never should have
opened my mouth.

839
00:55:42,939 --> 00:55:45,806
Yeah, okay.
Good to know.

840
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:49,171
Good to know.

841
00:55:56,453 --> 00:55:59,115
-A Buick. I'll get that.
-Thank you.

842
00:56:04,661 --> 00:56:05,855
I've got it.

843
00:56:08,832 --> 00:56:12,268
That's my stuff.
Do something.

844
00:56:12,669 --> 00:56:15,331
Go on, look at her.
She wants your lava, man.

845
00:56:16,606 --> 00:56:18,130
No, I'm not fooling her.

846
00:56:18,341 --> 00:56:22,277
You're saying that because you
fell out of a second story window.

847
00:56:22,645 --> 00:56:26,376
Even if she believes me, it won't
last. She is gonna figure it out.

848
00:56:26,883 --> 00:56:28,407
How is she gonna do that?

849
00:56:28,618 --> 00:56:31,553
Maybe when she sees that I have
one nipple and two testicles?

850
00:56:31,755 --> 00:56:33,245
Man, you are almost in there.

851
00:56:33,456 --> 00:56:37,552
Do you even know how hard
this is for me? I'm lame, man.

852
00:56:37,927 --> 00:56:40,862
What do you think girls say
when they see me coming?

853
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:43,157
"Oh, girl, look.
Here comes Phil The Loser.

854
00:56:43,366 --> 00:56:46,096
What stupid-ass thing
is he gonna say this time?"

855
00:56:46,302 --> 00:56:49,499
And you want me to be
somebody else? Why?

856
00:56:49,706 --> 00:56:52,072
So I can be humiliated
as two different people?

857
00:56:52,275 --> 00:56:53,537
Oh, my God.

858
00:56:54,377 --> 00:56:56,311
Oh, my God!

859
00:56:56,513 --> 00:56:59,846
-Oh, my God! It's Price!
-We love you, Price.

860
00:57:00,049 --> 00:57:03,314
-You have to sign my jog bra.
-I'm sorry, but I'm not Price.

861
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:05,454
-Yes, you are.
-No, I'm not.

862
00:57:05,655 --> 00:57:07,589
-I have your poster in my room.
-Yeah, me too.

863
00:57:07,824 --> 00:57:09,553
All right, girls,
you heard him. You hear him.

864
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:13,991
-You're really not Price?
-No. I'm just Phil.

865
00:57:14,397 --> 00:57:15,489
Phil?

866
00:57:21,871 --> 00:57:24,032
Somebody doesn't believe you.

867
00:57:44,928 --> 00:57:48,091
-You said ten bucks each.
-Did I?

868
00:57:49,666 --> 00:57:52,100
Or you can be the team bitch.

869
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:09,042
Say it, come on! Say it!

870
00:58:09,786 --> 00:58:12,254
-I am a dog.
-I'm sorry.

871
00:58:12,455 --> 00:58:14,855
Did I hear a cricket take a piss?

872
00:58:16,025 --> 00:58:17,117
Come on.

873
00:58:17,427 --> 00:58:19,190
I am a dog!

874
00:58:19,629 --> 00:58:21,961
Go! Go! Go!

875
00:58:27,637 --> 00:58:29,969
I'd better get going.
Brooke's waiting.

876
00:58:30,173 --> 00:58:32,403
You're actually going
through with this?

877
00:58:32,609 --> 00:58:34,941
-Disappointed?
-Impressed.

878
00:58:35,211 --> 00:58:38,237
I couldn't be with a chick
who's been with swine.

879
00:58:41,484 --> 00:58:43,645
-Guys.
-What the hell?

880
00:58:43,953 --> 00:58:45,420
-Guys!
-What?

881
00:58:45,688 --> 00:58:48,987
Did you hire a midget?
Because that's a young midget.

882
00:58:49,192 --> 00:58:51,558
Hold it, hold it, hold it.
What's that?

883
00:58:51,761 --> 00:58:53,956
-What's the matter?
-Is that your kid?

884
00:58:54,197 --> 00:58:57,064
-So?
-This is a bachelor party.

885
00:58:57,333 --> 00:58:59,995
My sitter got picked up
for D.U.I.

886
00:59:01,204 --> 00:59:02,933
Guys, I'm sorry.

887
00:59:03,139 --> 00:59:05,369
I will, take care of this shit,
I promise.

888
00:59:06,209 --> 00:59:07,233
What?

889
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:12,142
Suz! Where you been?

890
00:59:12,348 --> 00:59:14,509
Midnight service.
I lit a candle for you.

891
00:59:14,717 --> 00:59:16,844
That's nice, but I'm not the one
getting married.

892
00:59:17,053 --> 00:59:19,544
I asked the Virgin to keep you
away from Brooke.

893
00:59:19,756 --> 00:59:21,417
You had to bring Jesus' mom
into this?

894
00:59:21,624 --> 00:59:24,184
Jay, don't go there tonight.
You're in love with Reese.

895
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:26,358
What? Where do you get that?

896
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:28,224
I see the way you stare
at each other.

897
00:59:28,698 --> 00:59:30,598
We were over a long time ago.

898
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:33,428
Then why has every girlfriend
you ever had looked just like her?

899
00:59:33,670 --> 00:59:35,297
That is so not true.

900
00:59:35,505 --> 00:59:38,736
Kim and Stephanie?
Five-six, dark hair, button nose?

901
00:59:38,942 --> 00:59:41,934
Excuse me.
Stephanie had a deviated septum.

902
00:59:42,145 --> 00:59:44,045
-Don't go.
-I have to.

903
00:59:44,247 --> 00:59:45,805
Why?

904
00:59:46,015 --> 00:59:47,676
I can't tell you, okay?

905
00:59:48,217 --> 00:59:49,582
I can't.

906
00:59:51,087 --> 00:59:53,282
-Price?
-It's open.

907
00:59:59,662 --> 01:00:01,152
Price?

908
01:00:02,865 --> 01:00:04,526
What's up, sugar pie?

909
01:00:12,709 --> 01:00:15,200
About time. Here.

910
01:00:15,912 --> 01:00:17,539
Take these up to the pro shop.

911
01:00:18,848 --> 01:00:21,009
I'll take it from here,
Aunt Eppie.

912
01:00:36,833 --> 01:00:39,393
Let me just say,
you look good!

913
01:00:46,909 --> 01:00:51,039
I just want you to know even though
this is a one-night stand...

914
01:00:51,614 --> 01:00:54,583
I will not treat you like
a piece of meat.

915
01:00:54,817 --> 01:00:56,648
And when this is over...

916
01:00:58,955 --> 01:01:01,480
maybe we can catch a ball game...

917
01:01:02,892 --> 01:01:05,884
It would have to be a night game,
because I work weekends.

918
01:01:08,231 --> 01:01:12,463
Look, honey, we all have mothers.
But not at a bachelor party, okay?

919
01:01:12,669 --> 01:01:14,637
It violates "The Law of Man".

920
01:01:14,837 --> 01:01:19,240
I really need this gig. Couldn't we
come up with some compromise?

921
01:01:19,475 --> 01:01:20,874
Like?

922
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:27,777
<i>Don't even bother trying to explain</i>
<i>"The Law of Man" to a stripper.</i>

923
01:01:28,985 --> 01:01:32,512
-I can't, hon. I can't.
-At least consider my offer.

924
01:01:32,722 --> 01:01:35,247
You're probably good at this.

925
01:01:35,458 --> 01:01:38,916
-I'm a professional.
-Oh, for God's sakes, woman.

926
01:01:39,595 --> 01:01:41,426
I'm only human.

927
01:01:47,637 --> 01:01:49,332
You want control, huh?

928
01:01:50,373 --> 01:01:52,898
-What?
-Wait.

929
01:01:53,109 --> 01:01:55,100
I'm waiting.
I'm waiting.

930
01:01:56,012 --> 01:01:57,138
Here.

931
01:02:00,516 --> 01:02:03,644
I'm really, really flattered...

932
01:02:03,853 --> 01:02:06,754
but I'm more like
a small or medium.

933
01:02:06,956 --> 01:02:10,119
Silly. Stop playing around
and put in Frieda.

934
01:02:10,326 --> 01:02:12,453
-Frieda?
-My diaphragm.

935
01:02:12,662 --> 01:02:15,597
-You named your diaphragm?
-I name everything.

936
01:02:15,798 --> 01:02:19,393
Karen's my blow dryer
and Sophia's my tweezers.

937
01:02:19,602 --> 01:02:21,160
Okay.

938
01:02:21,370 --> 01:02:23,235
Let me see.
It should go like...

939
01:02:23,673 --> 01:02:26,039
Maybe I got it upside down?

940
01:02:28,344 --> 01:02:30,710
Before I...
where is the arrow on this thing?

941
01:02:30,913 --> 01:02:33,746
It's round.
Price, you have done this before?

942
01:02:34,417 --> 01:02:35,941
On a girl?

943
01:02:37,453 --> 01:02:39,785
Price Hurly
has done this before.

944
01:02:39,989 --> 01:02:43,356
No. I have.
I have done this before.

945
01:02:43,559 --> 01:02:46,289
It's just that a brother's just
a little rusty, that's all.

946
01:02:48,197 --> 01:02:49,528
Frieda!

947
01:02:52,935 --> 01:02:54,197
Goddamn it!

948
01:02:55,138 --> 01:02:56,503
Oh, no.
Frieda.

949
01:02:56,739 --> 01:02:59,003
You aren't Price Hurly, are you?

950
01:02:59,475 --> 01:03:01,204
No. No, I am.

951
01:03:01,577 --> 01:03:02,737
I am. Listen...

952
01:03:02,945 --> 01:03:06,938
I'm gonna go get it, I'm gonna
come back and prove that I'm Price.

953
01:03:10,853 --> 01:03:12,411
Come here...

954
01:03:12,822 --> 01:03:14,119
now!

955
01:03:20,696 --> 01:03:22,630
Let's get busy, sweetheart.

956
01:03:28,204 --> 01:03:29,671
I don't want to be a pain
or anything...

957
01:03:29,872 --> 01:03:33,399
but sex in the shower
recalls some very bad images for me.

958
01:03:34,677 --> 01:03:37,077
I've got a lot of catching up
to do...

959
01:03:38,848 --> 01:03:40,406
so get in here!

960
01:03:43,085 --> 01:03:45,246
Oh, one more day.

961
01:03:47,056 --> 01:03:50,423
24 hours.
It's only booty.

962
01:03:51,394 --> 01:03:57,355
Incredible stripper with nipples
like Susan B. Anthony dollars.

963
01:03:57,567 --> 01:03:58,727
Damn.

964
01:03:59,001 --> 01:04:01,469
-Keep it together.
-You poor, poor boy.

965
01:04:02,471 --> 01:04:04,803
It must be unbearable
having a condition like yours...

966
01:04:05,007 --> 01:04:07,373
and what did I do?
I made fun.

967
01:04:08,211 --> 01:04:10,111
-It's okay.
-No, it's not.

968
01:04:11,047 --> 01:04:13,743
I feel terrible.
I couldn't even sleep.

969
01:04:13,983 --> 01:04:15,917
Have you tried drinking
chocolate milk?

970
01:04:17,186 --> 01:04:19,746
I'll never forgive myself if you
don't let me help you with this.

971
01:04:20,156 --> 01:04:23,057
Please, I'll lose my car...

972
01:04:23,292 --> 01:04:25,157
Wilt Chamberlain's car.

973
01:04:25,928 --> 01:04:27,452
I'm here now.

974
01:04:28,698 --> 01:04:31,394
Tanya's gonna make you
whole again.

975
01:04:37,773 --> 01:04:39,468
You can't do this.

976
01:04:40,142 --> 01:04:41,632
You gotta do this.

977
01:04:42,311 --> 01:04:44,006
You'll lose everything.

978
01:04:45,047 --> 01:04:47,777
You can't deny
God's master plan.

979
01:04:47,984 --> 01:04:49,713
Who are you talking to?

980
01:04:49,919 --> 01:04:52,149
Get away!
Get away!

981
01:04:56,893 --> 01:04:57,917
That hurt.

982
01:05:04,267 --> 01:05:06,701
-What you looking for?
-Nothing.

983
01:05:07,203 --> 01:05:11,469
-I find stuff all the time.
-That's really nice.

984
01:05:12,275 --> 01:05:13,799
I found this.

985
01:05:16,178 --> 01:05:17,440
That's mine.

986
01:05:18,614 --> 01:05:20,309
Finders keepers.

987
01:05:21,384 --> 01:05:24,410
Hey, Buddy,
why don't you give that back?

988
01:05:24,620 --> 01:05:25,609
Why?
What is it?

989
01:05:27,189 --> 01:05:30,590
-Shouldn't you be in bed?
-It smells funny.

990
01:05:32,161 --> 01:05:33,890
You shouldn't be doing that.

991
01:05:35,131 --> 01:05:37,759
-It tastes funny, too.
-Oh, God, no.

992
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:42,161
Hey, look. Why don't you be
a nice little kid...

993
01:05:42,371 --> 01:05:44,862
and let me have it.

994
01:05:45,074 --> 01:05:48,237
-What in the hell's going on?
-What's in your mouth, Jimmy?

995
01:05:50,313 --> 01:05:52,873
-Jesus H. Christmas!
-Let go.

996
01:05:53,149 --> 01:05:57,085
-You sick bastard.
-I was trying to help him out.

997
01:05:58,454 --> 01:05:59,887
Wait a second.

998
01:06:00,856 --> 01:06:02,289
You're that underwear guy.

999
01:06:02,692 --> 01:06:05,752
Well, yeah, if you're asking.
I'm the man.

1000
01:06:06,262 --> 01:06:08,355
Why? You want an autograph
or something? What?

1001
01:06:09,632 --> 01:06:11,293
I'm not the man?

1002
01:06:16,305 --> 01:06:18,569
-Do you or don't you want me?
-I do.

1003
01:06:19,108 --> 01:06:20,097
Of course I do.

1004
01:06:20,409 --> 01:06:23,310
-Then give me what I need.
-What you need?

1005
01:06:24,981 --> 01:06:30,248
-You do know what a girl needs?
-Oh, that, yeah. Uh, more.

1006
01:06:31,387 --> 01:06:33,480
Maybe you should turn around?

1007
01:06:34,590 --> 01:06:36,683
I'm liking this already.

1008
01:06:38,928 --> 01:06:42,364
Uh, okay. Well, here we go.

1009
01:06:44,433 --> 01:06:48,301
-So, go.
-Just a second. I've never done this.

1010
01:06:49,205 --> 01:06:50,729
Not like, except...

1011
01:06:51,974 --> 01:06:54,135
writing my name in the snow.

1012
01:06:55,044 --> 01:06:58,309
-What are you doing?
-You prefer the front?

1013
01:06:58,647 --> 01:07:01,115
-You pee-peed on me.
-It's what you wanted, right?

1014
01:07:01,317 --> 01:07:04,286
Oh, you disgusting filthy freak.
Get out!

1015
01:07:05,121 --> 01:07:06,588
Get the hell out!

1016
01:07:08,424 --> 01:07:11,325
And don't you ever
come near me again!

1017
01:07:33,182 --> 01:07:34,945
Price?

1018
01:07:35,885 --> 01:07:37,716
Price?

1019
01:07:39,622 --> 01:07:43,388
Don't hide. I'm a huge fan.

1020
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:46,086
Hello.

1021
01:07:48,964 --> 01:07:51,023
No! No!

1022
01:08:14,523 --> 01:08:16,081
It's over.

1023
01:08:16,292 --> 01:08:19,284
-Congratulations.
-Are most definitely not in order.

1024
01:08:20,729 --> 01:08:23,061
And everything I was supposed
to do in the end?

1025
01:08:23,265 --> 01:08:25,358
You were right.
I couldn't do it.

1026
01:08:26,202 --> 01:08:29,296
I never had a one-night stand.
I was stupid for even trying.

1027
01:08:31,207 --> 01:08:33,266
Since when did you start smoking?

1028
01:08:33,476 --> 01:08:36,104
Since I jumped into a pool
with no water.

1029
01:08:36,712 --> 01:08:38,304
That must have hurt.

1030
01:08:38,514 --> 01:08:40,243
Yes. Yes, it did.

1031
01:08:42,251 --> 01:08:44,446
You're also right about Reese.

1032
01:08:44,887 --> 01:08:46,650
I never did get over her.

1033
01:08:47,156 --> 01:08:49,852
That's why every relationship
of mine has been a disaster.

1034
01:08:50,059 --> 01:08:53,085
Each one a band-aid just to cover up
for losing Reese.

1035
01:08:53,295 --> 01:08:55,490
And tomorrow I lose her for good.

1036
01:08:55,898 --> 01:08:57,923
So you didn't nail Brooke?

1037
01:08:58,134 --> 01:09:00,466
That's what I've been trying
to tell you.

1038
01:09:01,570 --> 01:09:03,800
That means I win the bet.

1039
01:09:05,941 --> 01:09:08,171
Susie's all yours...

1040
01:09:09,845 --> 01:09:12,177
if you can make it past tomorrow.

1041
01:09:25,628 --> 01:09:29,621
I have to tell you.
You look hideous.

1042
01:09:30,366 --> 01:09:31,663
Really?

1043
01:09:31,867 --> 01:09:35,564
Usually I'm pretty perky
after urinating on my date.

1044
01:09:35,771 --> 01:09:38,638
-It was a mean thing to do.
-Why did you do that?

1045
01:09:39,575 --> 01:09:42,976
-Because.
-Oh, that clears it up. Thanks.

1046
01:09:44,046 --> 01:09:46,378
Because I don't want you
to sleep with Brooke.

1047
01:09:47,917 --> 01:09:50,818
When Scott and I met,
he was everything I was looking for.

1048
01:09:50,953 --> 01:09:53,945
He's smart, handsome,
ambitious...

1049
01:09:54,323 --> 01:09:55,347
...funny.
-I know.

1050
01:09:55,558 --> 01:09:57,355
-A good kisser.
-I get the picture.

1051
01:09:57,560 --> 01:10:00,461
He made me forget about
what happened with us.

1052
01:10:00,663 --> 01:10:02,995
But, now that you're here,
I can't marry Scott...

1053
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:07,966
until I know if what you and I had
was a teenage fantasy...

1054
01:10:08,237 --> 01:10:10,137
or something real.

1055
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:26,415
Did I mention
I have this fetish?

1056
01:10:35,497 --> 01:10:37,192
Just a sec.

1057
01:10:39,535 --> 01:10:40,763
Reese?

1058
01:10:42,671 --> 01:10:43,968
Reese?

1059
01:10:48,244 --> 01:10:49,506
Reese?

1060
01:10:52,348 --> 01:10:54,646
Come on. Shake it, girlfriend.
We're late.

1061
01:10:56,352 --> 01:10:57,876
Reese?

1062
01:11:03,859 --> 01:11:05,053
Reese?

1063
01:11:05,261 --> 01:11:06,785
Jay!

1064
01:11:07,630 --> 01:11:10,599
You guys are cutting it
kinda close, huh? Everything cool?

1065
01:11:10,799 --> 01:11:13,859
Yeah. Under control.
Everything's good.

1066
01:11:14,470 --> 01:11:17,132
-There's something up, isn't there?
-Not at all.

1067
01:11:17,339 --> 01:11:19,637
Come on, man. We've been buds
forever. You can tell me.

1068
01:11:19,842 --> 01:11:22,902
-You holding out on me?
-No. Why would I do that?

1069
01:11:23,846 --> 01:11:27,043
I'm sorry. What am I saying.
This whole wedding thing...

1070
01:11:27,249 --> 01:11:29,479
is just playing games
with my head.

1071
01:11:30,919 --> 01:11:32,944
Scott, as a point of interest...

1072
01:11:33,155 --> 01:11:35,055
have you considered how fast
this whole thing is happening?

1073
01:11:35,291 --> 01:11:39,318
-I thought we already covered this.
-Yes, and it may just be me...

1074
01:11:40,329 --> 01:11:44,356
but, it doesn't really seem that
you care that much for Teresa.

1075
01:11:44,566 --> 01:11:47,399
Yeah. Sure I do.
For the most part.

1076
01:11:48,470 --> 01:11:50,529
Can you hand me that
shoe horn please?

1077
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:53,972
-"For the most part"?
-Look.

1078
01:11:54,943 --> 01:11:58,572
Maybe I don't "love" Teresa
in the traditional way...

1079
01:11:59,081 --> 01:12:02,482
but would you turn all this down
if it just landed in your lap?

1080
01:12:03,652 --> 01:12:06,587
But Scott, you're marrying
this girl. It's crazy.

1081
01:12:07,456 --> 01:12:10,425
And wagering your sister on a bet
with Dewey isn't?

1082
01:12:11,093 --> 01:12:13,027
How did you know?

1083
01:12:14,430 --> 01:12:15,988
What difference does it make?

1084
01:12:16,198 --> 01:12:19,224
The point is, you're just doing
what you got to do, just like me.

1085
01:12:20,536 --> 01:12:22,003
Maybe, but there's something
you don't know.

1086
01:12:22,471 --> 01:12:24,496
-What?
-Last night...

1087
01:12:24,707 --> 01:12:26,971
He's in here.
There he is.

1088
01:12:27,509 --> 01:12:29,670
Bad luck to see the groom
before the wedding.

1089
01:12:29,878 --> 01:12:31,106
-It's a big day for all of us.
-I know.

1090
01:12:31,313 --> 01:12:33,144
That's great. Right there.

1091
01:12:33,415 --> 01:12:35,178
Another one, please?

1092
01:12:35,384 --> 01:12:37,409
Look at this guy.
Great, great.

1093
01:12:37,853 --> 01:12:39,684
That's enough, Davey.
And don't forget...

1094
01:12:39,888 --> 01:12:42,413
I want a picture
with my Kosher meal people.

1095
01:12:44,093 --> 01:12:46,823
-A little nervous, are we?
-Well, I have a lot to live up to.

1096
01:12:47,229 --> 01:12:50,960
Now, not even Teresa knows this,
but before her mother passed away...

1097
01:12:51,567 --> 01:12:54,900
I promised our daughter's happiness
would come before everything.

1098
01:12:55,738 --> 01:12:58,707
Now, I don't pretend
to get this internet crap...

1099
01:12:58,907 --> 01:13:03,003
but I do know your success
would make Teresa very happy.

1100
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:06,272
So, "son"...

1101
01:13:07,082 --> 01:13:08,777
you've got your twelve mil.

1102
01:13:10,519 --> 01:13:11,577
Okay!

1103
01:13:13,122 --> 01:13:14,350
Welcome to the family.

1104
01:13:15,357 --> 01:13:16,688
Thanks, "Dad".

1105
01:13:17,626 --> 01:13:19,321
I'll see you at the altar.

1106
01:13:21,463 --> 01:13:22,623
Hey, Jay...

1107
01:13:23,365 --> 01:13:25,526
-Yeah?
-About last night...

1108
01:13:26,402 --> 01:13:30,395
Because of last night,
Philly's gonna be a little late.

1109
01:13:30,773 --> 01:13:31,831
Where is he?

1110
01:13:32,441 --> 01:13:35,171
Oh, I'm sure he'll make it.

1111
01:13:40,549 --> 01:13:41,538
Yes.

1112
01:14:00,068 --> 01:14:01,296
Hello.

1113
01:14:01,637 --> 01:14:04,231
I need a little help
on the balcony!

1114
01:14:04,473 --> 01:14:06,065
Oh, shit! I'm late!

1115
01:14:06,475 --> 01:14:07,499
Ann!

1116
01:14:08,043 --> 01:14:09,101
Out here!

1117
01:14:09,545 --> 01:14:12,105
Girl, look out the window!

1118
01:14:12,481 --> 01:14:13,505
No!

1119
01:14:14,416 --> 01:14:16,475
Don't go!

1120
01:14:17,853 --> 01:14:21,016
-Dude, I have to talk to you.
-Have you seen her anywhere?

1121
01:14:21,223 --> 01:14:23,748
We made a bet and I have
to respect that bet.

1122
01:14:23,959 --> 01:14:26,018
-She's putting on her dress.
-Who?

1123
01:14:26,228 --> 01:14:27,217
Reese.

1124
01:14:27,429 --> 01:14:29,090
And who cares where she is.

1125
01:14:29,298 --> 01:14:32,267
I'm trying to be straight with you
even though it's breaking my heart.

1126
01:14:32,534 --> 01:14:35,731
After we split up last night,
something went down.

1127
01:14:35,938 --> 01:14:37,701
-How did you know?
-How did I know what?

1128
01:14:37,906 --> 01:14:39,237
That after we split up,
something went down?

1129
01:14:39,441 --> 01:14:41,272
-'Cause I was there.
-You were there?

1130
01:14:41,543 --> 01:14:43,841
-Where else?
-You were in my room?

1131
01:14:44,079 --> 01:14:46,206
-No, I was in my room.
-And you saw us?

1132
01:14:46,448 --> 01:14:48,973
-What are you talking about?
-Last night.

1133
01:14:50,085 --> 01:14:51,450
Me, too.

1134
01:14:52,020 --> 01:14:54,011
When you left the bar
I hung out.

1135
01:14:54,223 --> 01:14:57,249
<i>You know, just chillin'.</i>
<i>Everything under control.</i>

1136
01:14:57,459 --> 01:15:01,054
<i>I mean, come on, a stripper?</i>
<i>I could handle that.</i>

1137
01:15:03,098 --> 01:15:04,963
<i>So that's what I did.</i>

1138
01:15:05,534 --> 01:15:08,503
<i>I tried to stop myself but</i>
<i>it was useless.</i>

1139
01:15:08,704 --> 01:15:11,264
<i>A higher power</i>
<i>had me in its grip...</i>

1140
01:15:11,473 --> 01:15:13,634
<i>maybe even the Big Guy himself.</i>

1141
01:15:15,444 --> 01:15:16,570
I'm sorry, Wilt.

1142
01:15:18,146 --> 01:15:20,774
Um, I should probably mention
something else.

1143
01:15:23,285 --> 01:15:25,879
-You what?
-I nailed Tanya and the stripper.

1144
01:15:26,522 --> 01:15:28,581
-But that means...
-That I lost the bet.

1145
01:15:28,790 --> 01:15:30,587
We both lost the bet.

1146
01:15:32,528 --> 01:15:35,122
-You did lose the bet?
-Excuse me?

1147
01:15:36,098 --> 01:15:38,726
Rafferty, did you bone someone?

1148
01:15:40,402 --> 01:15:42,996
-We're waiting!
-What are you, retarded?

1149
01:15:43,205 --> 01:15:46,971
-Just take a seat, dude.
-We're supposed to seat them.

1150
01:15:47,376 --> 01:15:49,742
We are?
Well, that blows.

1151
01:15:50,979 --> 01:15:52,913
Don't expect anything up front.

1152
01:15:57,185 --> 01:15:58,777
Reese!

1153
01:16:02,024 --> 01:16:05,482
-Your hair looks beautiful.
-With that dress.

1154
01:16:05,694 --> 01:16:07,059
I hate you.

1155
01:16:08,497 --> 01:16:10,294
I need to see Teresa.

1156
01:16:10,566 --> 01:16:13,399
-I'm sorry. I left it at home.
-What's that?

1157
01:16:13,602 --> 01:16:15,900
-The rats ass I'm supposed to give.
-Reese!

1158
01:16:16,104 --> 01:16:18,902
-She doesn't want to see you.
-I have to speak to her.

1159
01:16:19,107 --> 01:16:21,905
She says "Mister Dirty Pants"
can come in.

1160
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:33,886
Oh, that's nice.

1161
01:16:34,289 --> 01:16:37,224
Well, there's only one first time
you get married, so...

1162
01:16:38,427 --> 01:16:41,123
-So don't you should be sure?
-I am sure.

1163
01:16:43,098 --> 01:16:45,498
Tell me last night
wasn't incredible.

1164
01:16:45,701 --> 01:16:46,861
It was.

1165
01:16:47,069 --> 01:16:50,436
Then how could you just sneak out
and pretend like it never happened?

1166
01:16:50,706 --> 01:16:52,970
I can't just cancel my wedding...

1167
01:16:53,175 --> 01:16:54,938
because my high school boyfriend
showed up.

1168
01:16:55,143 --> 01:16:57,338
-People do it all the time.
-It's a fantasy.

1169
01:16:57,546 --> 01:17:00,242
We don't even know each other
anymore.

1170
01:17:00,983 --> 01:17:02,177
Would you hand me my shoes.

1171
01:17:02,517 --> 01:17:05,543
Reese, that buzz I had last night
wasn't theater.

1172
01:17:06,088 --> 01:17:08,454
Whatever we used to have
is still there.

1173
01:17:10,192 --> 01:17:13,787
When I was ten, I had this fantasy,
every little girl does...

1174
01:17:13,996 --> 01:17:16,829
about the perfect wedding
with the perfect dress...

1175
01:17:17,032 --> 01:17:21,492
and the ceremony and the guy
you pictured standing next to you.

1176
01:17:22,304 --> 01:17:24,636
Well, that's happening
for me today.

1177
01:17:25,173 --> 01:17:27,164
You're scared.
Fine.

1178
01:17:27,943 --> 01:17:31,811
I'll tell Scott. He's a black belt,
but I  can move fast.

1179
01:17:32,280 --> 01:17:35,010
Jay, last night was a beautiful
"could have been"...

1180
01:17:35,217 --> 01:17:37,685
but I'm getting married today
and you have to accept that.

1181
01:17:37,886 --> 01:17:42,152
I will. When you can say to my face
I don't mean anything to you.

1182
01:17:47,562 --> 01:17:49,359
I have to finish my make-up.

1183
01:17:57,039 --> 01:17:59,098
I heard what happened
with Brooke.

1184
01:17:59,875 --> 01:18:01,934
Great. What did they do,
put it in the wedding program?

1185
01:18:02,144 --> 01:18:05,944
I am just so proud of you! I knew
you couldn't go through with it!

1186
01:18:06,615 --> 01:18:11,382
Because of last night there were
things that were put into motion.

1187
01:18:11,687 --> 01:18:12,676
What do you mean?

1188
01:18:13,288 --> 01:18:15,313
Promises were made
that concern you.

1189
01:18:15,791 --> 01:18:18,021
-Me?
-Unfortunately, yes.

1190
01:18:18,226 --> 01:18:20,217
Are you mixed up
in these promises?

1191
01:18:22,297 --> 01:18:24,527
Well, yeah.

1192
01:18:24,733 --> 01:18:26,098
Well, then I'm not worried...

1193
01:18:26,301 --> 01:18:29,202
I trust you more than anyone else
in the whole wide world.

1194
01:18:29,471 --> 01:18:33,908
And I know you would never do
anything to hurt me. Go get'em.

1195
01:18:39,881 --> 01:18:43,214
Where have you been? I had to seat
300 rich asses. They don't tip.

1196
01:18:43,418 --> 01:18:45,978
-Where's Phil?
-Still a no-show.

1197
01:18:47,789 --> 01:18:49,689
We can't wait for him any longer.

1198
01:19:24,860 --> 01:19:26,589
Where's Philly?

1199
01:19:27,963 --> 01:19:29,794
I'm sure he'll make it.

1200
01:19:42,978 --> 01:19:46,141
Is that a slice of paradise?

1201
01:19:46,348 --> 01:19:49,317
Twelve mil on the hoof.
Come to daddy, honey.

1202
01:20:28,523 --> 01:20:32,323
Please join me in celebrating
the love of these two young people...

1203
01:20:33,061 --> 01:20:37,998
who today have arrived at this
moment of fulfillment and promise.

1204
01:20:51,980 --> 01:20:53,675
I gotta pee.

1205
01:20:55,617 --> 01:20:56,709
Help.

1206
01:20:57,819 --> 01:20:59,309
Look at me.

1207
01:21:00,188 --> 01:21:01,416
Ann.

1208
01:21:02,924 --> 01:21:04,755
Help me!

1209
01:21:08,029 --> 01:21:10,190
Scott and Teresa,
in making these vows...

1210
01:21:10,398 --> 01:21:13,765
your hearts have given themselves
over to the confidence and faith...

1211
01:21:14,102 --> 01:21:16,662
that only true love can bring.

1212
01:21:16,905 --> 01:21:19,772
In the spirit of this faith, I'd like
to ask those of you gathered...

1213
01:21:19,975 --> 01:21:22,500
if there is anyone
who objects to this union.

1214
01:21:23,979 --> 01:21:26,140
I object to gay videos.

1215
01:21:28,516 --> 01:21:32,282
Well, then. Teresa, do you take
Scott to be your husband?

1216
01:21:32,687 --> 01:21:36,589
For better, or worse,
for richer or poorer...

1217
01:21:36,858 --> 01:21:38,723
in sickness and in health...

1218
01:21:38,994 --> 01:21:40,894
for as long as you both
shall live?

1219
01:21:44,799 --> 01:21:45,959
I do.

1220
01:21:46,635 --> 01:21:48,102
Own it, baby.

1221
01:21:54,776 --> 01:21:55,834
Phil?

1222
01:21:56,912 --> 01:22:00,404
Just, a band...
You got any Tupac?

1223
01:22:00,982 --> 01:22:03,007
Hey, Scott.
What are you doing here?

1224
01:22:03,418 --> 01:22:05,579
-You can't marry Scott.
-I just did.

1225
01:22:05,787 --> 01:22:07,414
-He's doing it for money.
-That's not true.

1226
01:22:07,622 --> 01:22:09,522
-He doesn't love you.
-I don't want to hear this.

1227
01:22:09,724 --> 01:22:12,158
Look at me. You said we don't know
each other anymore, right?

1228
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:15,488
Well, know this. There are a lot of
girls out there who look like you.

1229
01:22:15,697 --> 01:22:18,825
I'd probably get together with
every one of them. Why?

1230
01:22:19,034 --> 01:22:21,935
In the hope that someone out there
can live up to the feelings...

1231
01:22:22,137 --> 01:22:25,595
I haven't been able to shake since
when I saw you at that concert.

1232
01:22:27,943 --> 01:22:30,173
Look at the flowers.
They're so pretty.

1233
01:22:30,512 --> 01:22:31,740
Who died?

1234
01:22:32,814 --> 01:22:35,806
Hey, Spice Girls.

1235
01:22:36,685 --> 01:22:39,745
-If everyone has arrived...
-No worries. Let it rip.

1236
01:22:40,455 --> 01:22:43,891
Let's see. Bride's I do's...
then, Scott.

1237
01:22:44,092 --> 01:22:46,583
Do you take Teresa
to be your wife?

1238
01:22:46,795 --> 01:22:50,322
For better, or worse,
for richer or poorer...

1239
01:22:50,565 --> 01:22:53,693
in sickness and in health for
as long as you both shall live?

1240
01:22:54,569 --> 01:22:57,629
-I do.
-Then you may exchange the rings.

1241
01:22:57,872 --> 01:23:01,364
A symbolic start to the journey
you are about to take.

1242
01:23:36,277 --> 01:23:38,404
Could I change my answer?

1243
01:23:38,747 --> 01:23:41,910
-What?
-Is it possible to take it back?

1244
01:23:42,150 --> 01:23:44,277
-Teresa.
-But you've already said it.

1245
01:23:44,519 --> 01:23:48,250
-Yeah, but, things have changed.
-You can't take back a vow.

1246
01:23:48,456 --> 01:23:50,390
-I can't?
-Certainly not!

1247
01:23:50,859 --> 01:23:52,156
-Then Scott...
-Yeah?

1248
01:23:52,961 --> 01:23:55,020
-I want a divorce.
-What? Are you kidding me?

1249
01:23:56,031 --> 01:23:58,693
-Desecrater!
-Outrageous!

1250
01:23:59,734 --> 01:24:02,703
I also object to
Vietnamese people!

1251
01:24:02,904 --> 01:24:05,395
Let's go, Rafferty!
Right now! You and me outside...

1252
01:24:05,707 --> 01:24:07,038
you son-of-a-bitch!

1253
01:24:10,111 --> 01:24:12,636
And Jesus can see you!

1254
01:24:13,782 --> 01:24:15,340
<i>Is that vile or what?</i>

1255
01:24:15,650 --> 01:24:18,642
<i>Yet another atrocity against</i>
<i>"The Law of Man".</i>

1256
01:24:19,220 --> 01:24:22,314
<i>Ever since then it's been like</i>
<i>a Bombay bus crash.</i>

1257
01:24:22,524 --> 01:24:25,459
<i>First, Jay and Reese</i>
<i>move in together with "Nibbles"...</i>

1258
01:24:25,660 --> 01:24:26,820
<i>her jealous cat.</i>

1259
01:24:28,963 --> 01:24:32,091
<i>Then it gets really twisted.</i>
<i>Poor Phil.</i>

1260
01:24:32,333 --> 01:24:34,528
<i>If those Ice Age guys are around</i>
<i>to see this...</i>

1261
01:24:34,736 --> 01:24:39,105
<i>they'd repo' our dicks.</i>
<i>Notice I did say "our dicks".</i>

1262
01:24:39,307 --> 01:24:40,103
I love you.

1263
01:24:40,708 --> 01:24:44,769
<i>See, I moved in</i>
<i>with Jay's sister two months ago.</i>

1264
01:24:45,747 --> 01:24:48,511
And Dewey won't ever sleep
with another woman again?

1265
01:24:49,317 --> 01:24:53,014
No, Mistress Susie.
May I please have another?

1266
01:24:57,859 --> 01:25:00,054
<i>Gentlemen, we're all doomed...</i>

1267
01:25:01,062 --> 01:25:03,292
<i>every last one of us.</i>

1268
01:25:19,214 --> 01:25:20,681
And... Action!

1269
01:25:27,689 --> 01:25:31,216
That's why my areolas
are so swollen.

1270
01:25:35,964 --> 01:25:37,192
Smile for the butt!

1271
01:25:37,732 --> 01:25:39,996
What kind of bad things?

1272
01:25:49,711 --> 01:25:51,008
She passed away.

1273
01:25:53,448 --> 01:25:55,382
-You bastard.
-I also...

1274
01:25:59,287 --> 01:26:01,084
I also...

1275
01:26:02,857 --> 01:26:04,222
What is it?
Look, can I...

1276
01:26:06,861 --> 01:26:09,625
That's what I'm talking about.
Yeah!

1277
01:26:15,136 --> 01:26:16,125
Action!

1278
01:26:16,337 --> 01:26:20,171
This whole wedding thing
is just playing games...

1279
01:26:28,383 --> 01:26:29,077
Sorry.

1280
01:26:30,318 --> 01:26:31,683
Oh, yeah...

1281
01:26:33,488 --> 01:26:36,082
-What's your name again? Okay.
-Susie.

1282
01:26:37,158 --> 01:26:38,853
Look at this little fella.

1283
01:26:47,135 --> 01:26:50,070
Get it! Get it down!
