Candace.

3
00:00:49,968 --> 00:00:51,753
Hey, Candace.

4
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,843
What?

5
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:58,803
Do you think that
because time is an illusion

6
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:00,544
and it's, like, not real

7
00:01:00,631 --> 00:01:03,112
that if you looked at mankind

8
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:05,636
from, like, the fourth
dimension's perspective,

9
00:01:05,723 --> 00:01:09,858
we'd just look like this weird,
wormlike creature,

10
00:01:09,945 --> 00:01:13,035
where on one end we're old
but then, on the other end,

11
00:01:13,122 --> 00:01:15,690
we're still young like a baby?

12
00:01:15,777 --> 00:01:18,301
And we're even connected
to our moms and dads,

13
00:01:18,388 --> 00:01:20,521
because at one point,
we were inside of them.

14
00:01:20,608 --> 00:01:22,208
And they're connected
to their moms and dads

15
00:01:22,218 --> 00:01:24,090
and their moms and dads

16
00:01:24,177 --> 00:01:27,441
and so on and so forth till,
like, the beginning of time.

17
00:01:27,528 --> 00:01:30,574
And it goes even bigger
than that because-because

18
00:01:30,661 --> 00:01:32,794
we're all evolved from animals

19
00:01:32,881 --> 00:01:34,873
and all the animals are evolved
from other animals,

20
00:01:34,883 --> 00:01:38,234
all the way back to, like, the
first single-celled organism.

21
00:01:38,321 --> 00:01:40,889
And we're all part of this one living thing

22
00:01:40,976 --> 00:01:43,457
and we've just been dipped
into the third dimension,

23
00:01:43,544 --> 00:01:46,155
so we're really just
observing and interacting

24
00:01:46,242 --> 00:01:48,940
with other parts of ourselves.

25
00:01:49,027 --> 00:01:50,855
Do you ever think about that?

26
00:01:50,942 --> 00:01:53,902
Do I ever think, "Was I dipped
into a third dimension?"

27
00:01:53,989 --> 00:01:57,253
No, I don't. I don't, Trevor.
Good night.

Trevor does Internet videos,
too. -What's your highest

718
00:32:14,068 --> 00:32:15,940
- view count?
- TREVOR: Um, actually,

719
00:32:16,027 --> 00:32:18,377
you know, have, uh, some that
have, like, a couple million.

720
00:32:18,464 --> 00:32:20,335
Yeah, that's, uh...
You got to start somewhere.

721
00:32:20,422 --> 00:32:24,165
Actually, my biggest view count
came from an exposé I did.

722
00:32:24,252 --> 00:32:27,125
Yeah, I found this other
YouTuber in middle school.

723
00:32:27,212 --> 00:32:29,475
He left a Facebook comment demeaning women.

724
00:32:29,562 --> 00:32:32,130
Middle school women,
so I popped that cherry

725
00:32:32,217 --> 00:32:34,349
on him... my exposé.
Next thing you know, he lost

726
00:32:34,436 --> 00:32:37,222
half his subs, his real job
and his channel.

727
00:32:37,309 --> 00:32:40,399
- That's so good.
- See, Trevor?

728
00:32:40,486 --> 00:32:42,357
Those are the videos you should be making.

729
00:32:42,444 --> 00:32:44,707
Oh, yeah, right. He actually
likes all that sexist stuff.

730
00:32:44,794 --> 00:32:46,927
What? What?

731
00:32:47,014 --> 00:32:49,495
-CANDACE: Well, yeah, you're
sexist. -TREVOR: What? Candace.

732
00:32:49,582 --> 00:32:51,661
I'm not sexist. What are you...
what are you talking about?

733
00:32:51,671 --> 00:32:54,717
- Yes, you are.
- What have I done that's sexist?

734
00:32:54,804 --> 00:32:58,069
I mean, you didn't like Hillary.

735
00:32:58,156 --> 00:33:00,506
- -Uh, that...
- that-that's not fair.

736
00:33:00,593 --> 00:33:02,150
CANDACE: I'm telling you,
he's one of those,

737
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:04,065
- like, alt-right troll people.
- Uh-uh. -TREVOR: Whoa.

738
00:33:04,075 --> 00:33:06,599
I am... I am not alt-right.

739
00:33:06,686 --> 00:33:08,383
I'm not alt-right.
How am I alt-right?

740
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:10,733
Trevor, you didn't like Hamilton.

741
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:12,518
- -What?!
- TREVOR: I didn't see it.

742
00:33:12,605 --> 00:33:14,999
- You didn't wantto see it.
- I...

743
00:33:15,086 --> 00:33:18,654
I don't like musicals, but
that doesn't make me alt-right.

744
00:33:18,741 --> 00:33:20,439
I'm not alt-right.

745
00:33:20,526 --> 00:33:22,257
I think that whole
alt-right thing is retarded.

746
00:33:22,267 --> 00:33:24,443
- -Oh, my God!
- You cannot use that word!

747
00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:27,054
They're-they're white. -I'm
actually doing some co-branding

748
00:33:27,141 --> 00:33:28,360
with this new app that, like,

749
00:33:28,447 --> 00:33:30,318
helps you get involved
in stuff. -Mm-hmm.

750
00:33:30,405 --> 00:33:33,452
What's it called? -Like,
Helps You Get Involved in Stuff.

751
00:33:33,539 --> 00:33:35,106
It can do all kinds of magic.
Basically

752
00:33:35,193 --> 00:33:36,759
tells you who your congressman is,

753
00:33:36,846 --> 00:33:38,413
calls them, and then gives you,

754
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:40,459
like, this nice little script to read

755
00:33:40,546 --> 00:33:42,635
so you sound like you know
what you're talking about.

756
00:33:42,722 --> 00:33:45,681
- That's amazing.
- I'm doing it right now.

757
00:33:45,768 --> 00:33:47,988
- Make a difference.
- Wait. What are you doing?

758
00:33:48,075 --> 00:33:50,686
She's calling our congressman
'cause we're sick of this shit.

759
00:33:50,773 --> 00:33:52,993
Okay, it says vote "yes" on prop 594.

760
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:55,778
- TREVOR: What-what does that do?
- That makes it a felony

761
00:33:55,865 --> 00:33:57,867
to be mean to people online.

762
00:33:57,954 --> 00:34:00,479
Well, that's a little insane, isn't it?

763
00:34:00,566 --> 00:34:02,481
What do you mean, insane?

764
00:34:02,568 --> 00:34:06,267
Insane? -Doesn't this all seem
a little crazy? I mean,

765
00:34:06,354 --> 00:34:09,705
doesn't it seem like,
at a certain point, we're just

766
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:13,057
constantly looking for stuff
to be upset about?

767
00:34:13,144 --> 00:34:16,495
So you think we should just be
okay with how things are?

768
00:34:16,582 --> 00:34:18,801
No, no, no, no.
No. Look, I know

769
00:34:18,888 --> 00:34:21,055
that the world has a lot of
problems, and-and, you know...

770
00:34:21,065 --> 00:34:25,460
and it's good that people want
to stop those problems, but,

771
00:34:25,547 --> 00:34:28,072
I mean, it's just every day,
I can't... I can't be upset

772
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:32,076
about everything every day.
Can't I have outrage fatigue?

773
00:34:32,163 --> 00:34:34,295
BRLAYDEN:
Yeah, must be tough for, like,

774
00:34:34,382 --> 00:34:36,906
a white male having
to deal with all this stuff.

775
00:34:36,993 --> 00:34:38,691
Look, no, it's-it's not that.

776
00:34:38,778 --> 00:34:41,085
ALL: It is that. -Okay,
maybe it is. I don't know.

777
00:34:41,172 --> 00:34:43,261
I'm just saying, is it a crime

778
00:34:43,348 --> 00:34:46,481
to not take everything seriously?

779
00:34:46,568 --> 00:34:50,181
Yes, dude. We don't even know
how long we are here on this

780
00:34:50,268 --> 00:34:52,183
ball of dirt.
Sometimes we aren't sure.

781
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:54,533
And we have some responsibilities

782
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:56,970
to make good content, to put it out there

783
00:34:57,057 --> 00:34:59,842
and to push the ball forward.

784
00:34:59,929 --> 00:35:02,932
- Everyone has something to say.
- What are yougoing to say?

785
00:35:03,019 --> 00:35:04,673
