1
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:07,522
True yoga is not about
the shape of your body

2
00:03:07,588 --> 00:03:09,289
but the shape of your life.

3
00:03:13,995 --> 00:03:16,329
This is such fucking bullshit.

4
00:03:29,844 --> 00:03:33,047
These white walls create
such mystical notions.

5
00:03:33,114 --> 00:03:35,382
They are undefinably absolute.

6
00:03:35,449 --> 00:03:37,919
I will take this piece
right here please.

7
00:03:37,985 --> 00:03:40,353
This is such fucking bullshit.

8
00:03:46,027 --> 00:03:48,996
Put the money in the bag!
Put the money in the bag!

9
00:03:49,063 --> 00:03:50,363
Do you wanna play?

10
00:03:51,999 --> 00:03:54,035
Barry loves to play.

11
00:03:58,039 --> 00:03:59,040
Cut.

12
00:04:00,641 --> 00:04:03,578
That was beautiful, Ezra,
truly groundbreaking work.

13
00:04:03,644 --> 00:04:05,913
This is such fucking bullshit.

14
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,089
Fuck you and your pussy board.

15
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:18,860
This is such fucking bullshit.

16
00:04:26,134 --> 00:04:27,602
Pack your bags!

17
00:04:27,668 --> 00:04:29,036
What's the word, Diamond?

18
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:31,606
Yeah, I'm just super busy
here at the art gallery.

19
00:04:31,672 --> 00:04:32,940
Yeah, you're about
as busy over there

20
00:04:33,074 --> 00:04:34,509
selling overpriced
sheets of white paper

21
00:04:34,709 --> 00:04:36,911
as I am over here
practicing my Oscar speech.

22
00:04:36,978 --> 00:04:39,180
Daddy has given us
his jet and villa,

23
00:04:39,247 --> 00:04:43,818
we take off tomorrow for an
insta trip you won't forget.

24
00:04:43,885 --> 00:04:45,186
What?
No shit.

25
00:04:45,253 --> 00:04:46,721
That sounds amazing.

26
00:04:46,788 --> 00:04:48,956
Which one of your daddy's
houses are we going to?

27
00:04:49,857 --> 00:04:50,992
Phuket...

28
00:04:51,058 --> 00:04:52,994
Thailand!

29
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,427
Are you sure it's safe there?

30
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:56,898
Decap Ezra,
of course it's safe.

31
00:04:56,964 --> 00:04:58,298
Now go pack your shit.

32
00:04:58,365 --> 00:05:00,101
Wheels up first thing
in the morning.

33
00:05:00,367 --> 00:05:02,737
See y'all on a G tomorrow.
Diamond out.

34
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,081
Welcome, ladies.

35
00:05:14,148 --> 00:05:16,217
Now where the fuck is Ryder?

36
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:19,086
Oh, of course.

37
00:05:28,162 --> 00:05:29,396
Nice luggage, Ryder.

38
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:30,665
Fuck off, Daisy.

39
00:05:30,731 --> 00:05:32,033
Oh you would
love to fuck Daisy.

40
00:05:32,099 --> 00:05:33,501
How do you know I haven't?

41
00:05:36,604 --> 00:05:38,371
Wow, welcome, ladies.

42
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:40,174
I'm Jasper McDaniel.
I'll be your pilot.

43
00:05:40,241 --> 00:05:41,408
We have good weather,

44
00:05:41,609 --> 00:05:43,244
so we should be arriving
in Phuket on time.

45
00:05:43,311 --> 00:05:45,012
Sit back, relax,
enjoy the flight,

46
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:47,782
and if you guys need
anything, I'll be up front.

47
00:05:47,849 --> 00:05:50,251
Oh my, I can think
of a few things

48
00:05:50,318 --> 00:05:51,886
that our captain can do to me.

49
00:05:51,953 --> 00:05:54,522
Diamond, just let
him focus on his job,

50
00:05:54,589 --> 00:05:56,824
which is literally making
sure we don't crash and die.

51
00:05:56,891 --> 00:05:58,059
Fuck off.

52
00:05:58,125 --> 00:06:00,027
Oh this is fucking awesome!

53
00:06:00,094 --> 00:06:03,264
Enough of the
chitchat, I want a shot.

54
00:06:03,331 --> 00:06:05,933
God, Daisy, the
sun's barely up.

55
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,536
Well I'm sure the sun
is up in Thailand by now.

56
00:06:08,603 --> 00:06:11,839
And I'm just pro-actively
curing future jet lag.

57
00:06:11,906 --> 00:06:12,940
To sex.

58
00:06:13,007 --> 00:06:13,941
To drugs.

59
00:06:14,008 --> 00:06:15,243
To rock and roll.

60
00:06:21,682 --> 00:06:23,784
I think we should all
go around in a circle

61
00:06:23,851 --> 00:06:27,054
and collectively
set an intention

62
00:06:27,121 --> 00:06:28,689
for our vacay together.

63
00:06:28,756 --> 00:06:31,959
Oh my God, Ezra, stop being
so fucking introspective.

64
00:06:32,026 --> 00:06:33,426
Like, just relax.

65
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:35,462
Here, take a pull.

66
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:38,699
I wanna get into some
of that full moon powder

67
00:06:38,766 --> 00:06:41,569
and turn this beach
trip into a ski trip.

68
00:06:41,636 --> 00:06:43,403
Ryder, what about you?

69
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:45,673
I wanna connect
with my friends,

70
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:48,276
and have the experience
of a lifetime.

71
00:06:48,342 --> 00:06:50,011
That sounds
pretty fucking lame.

72
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:55,482
I want to eat great
food, sleep long nights

73
00:06:55,549 --> 00:06:59,053
and fuck anyone I want.

74
00:07:01,322 --> 00:07:02,323
Daddy issues.

75
00:07:03,824 --> 00:07:06,861
My daddy has issues
with you on his plane.

76
00:07:06,928 --> 00:07:08,729
There is the fucking door, Ezra.

77
00:07:09,797 --> 00:07:12,700
Oh my God, chill out.

78
00:07:12,767 --> 00:07:16,704
Well, I intend to fuck on blow

79
00:07:17,171 --> 00:07:19,807
and have an experience
that we'll never forget.

80
00:07:20,374 --> 00:07:23,978
To motherfucking
Thailand, yeah!

81
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,549
I gotta piss.

82
00:08:01,615 --> 00:08:03,050
Oh enjoy.

83
00:08:03,117 --> 00:08:04,919
I'm gonna go up front
to see if there's

84
00:08:04,986 --> 00:08:07,588
anything I can do
for our captain.

85
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:11,425
Hey, please don't
fuck with him too much.

86
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,928
I wanna get there in one piece.

87
00:08:21,669 --> 00:08:23,104
Ryder, what the fuck?

88
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:24,672
I thought we could
use some alone time.

89
00:08:24,739 --> 00:08:26,674
Now is not the time.

90
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:28,342
If not now, then when?

91
00:08:28,409 --> 00:08:30,111
Look, it's not easy, Ryder.

92
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:32,446
I mean, life is
complicated for some of us.

93
00:08:32,513 --> 00:08:33,914
For some of us.

94
00:08:34,348 --> 00:08:36,317
What's that supposed to mean?

95
00:08:36,384 --> 00:08:37,918
Look, I am not you.

96
00:08:37,985 --> 00:08:41,188
I'm not all confident wrapped
up in this badassness.

97
00:08:42,923 --> 00:08:47,928
Daisy, you have more
badass in you than you know.

98
00:08:48,929 --> 00:08:50,197
Just go.

99
00:08:59,807 --> 00:09:02,511
This is a club I
thought I'd never join.

100
00:09:02,576 --> 00:09:04,011
The Bang Your
Best Friend Club.

101
00:09:04,078 --> 00:09:06,313
The Mile-High, you
asshole.

102
00:09:20,795 --> 00:09:22,763
Get some air in here, Dang.

103
00:09:23,532 --> 00:09:24,598
Knock, knock.

104
00:09:24,665 --> 00:09:26,667
Hello, Diamond.
Everything okay?

105
00:09:26,734 --> 00:09:28,235
Everything's great.

106
00:09:28,302 --> 00:09:30,438
Just thought you could
use some company.

107
00:09:31,038 --> 00:09:35,142
Uh, Dang, I'm
stretching my legs.

108
00:09:35,209 --> 00:09:36,610
Controls are off to you.

109
00:09:42,551 --> 00:09:45,786
Wow, you girls really
know how to trash a plane.

110
00:09:45,853 --> 00:09:48,722
Uh, yeah, I've had plenty
of years of experience.

111
00:09:48,789 --> 00:09:49,957
I believe it.

112
00:09:50,024 --> 00:09:52,193
Mm-hm.
So you know my dad?

113
00:09:52,893 --> 00:09:55,930
Not personally, but I
am a fan of his movies.

114
00:09:55,996 --> 00:09:59,166
Oh, I'm sensing a little bit
of mystery to you, Captain.

115
00:09:59,233 --> 00:10:01,035
Mystery? Me?

116
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:03,505
My life's pretty boring.

117
00:10:03,572 --> 00:10:05,507
I wish I had something to hide.

118
00:10:05,574 --> 00:10:07,108
Married? Kids?

119
00:10:07,174 --> 00:10:10,277
Oh no, no, no, no, no.
I'm perpetually single.

120
00:10:10,344 --> 00:10:11,479
Mm.

121
00:10:12,113 --> 00:10:14,815
Well, we might have to do
something to change that.

122
00:10:17,852 --> 00:10:19,253
What about you?

123
00:10:20,221 --> 00:10:21,155
Me?

124
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:24,458
Oh well, that's gonna take
at least a second date.

125
00:10:29,163 --> 00:10:30,898
Do me a favor.
Grab a seat, okay?

126
00:10:33,667 --> 00:10:35,102
Are we there?

127
00:10:35,169 --> 00:10:36,505
<i>Okay, ladies,</i>

128
00:10:36,571 --> 00:10:37,638
<i>we hit some inclement weather.</i>

129
00:10:37,705 --> 00:10:39,206
It's gonna get a
little bumpy, so

130
00:10:39,273 --> 00:10:40,774
if you could please
buckle your seat belts.

131
00:10:40,841 --> 00:10:42,676
We're gonna crash.
We're all gonna die!

132
00:10:42,743 --> 00:10:43,811
Hey, hey, hey, guys,
we're not gonna die.

133
00:10:43,878 --> 00:10:45,246
It's just a storm.

134
00:10:45,346 --> 00:10:47,381
Yeah, a storm we're right
in the fucking middle of.

135
00:10:47,448 --> 00:10:49,049
We're gonna die!

136
00:10:49,116 --> 00:10:50,985
Ryder, I used your toothbrush,
and I never told you.

137
00:10:51,051 --> 00:10:54,321
And, Daisy, I'm sorry I puked
in the back of your car.

138
00:10:54,388 --> 00:10:59,426
Diamond, I'm so sorry,
but I slept with your dad.

139
00:11:01,896 --> 00:11:03,130
You motherfucker!

140
00:11:03,197 --> 00:11:04,899
Technically, she's
a fatherfucker.

141
00:11:04,965 --> 00:11:06,400
What is the matter with it!

142
00:11:06,467 --> 00:11:10,971
I just want you guys to
know how much I love you.

143
00:11:12,507 --> 00:11:14,008
<i>Ladies,</i>
<i>quick little update.</i>

144
00:11:14,074 --> 00:11:15,309
<i>We've hit some bad whether,</i>

145
00:11:15,644 --> 00:11:17,845
<i>and the Phuket Airport</i>
<i>has been shut down,</i>

146
00:11:17,912 --> 00:11:20,414
<i>so we're gonna land</i>
<i>on a private airstrip</i>
<i>outside of town.</i>

147
00:11:20,481 --> 00:11:23,017
<i>There'll be a car waiting for</i>
<i>you, and your bags will follow</i>

148
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:24,653
<i>and be delivered later today.</i>

149
00:11:24,718 --> 00:11:25,920
<i>Prepare for landing.</i>

150
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:05,694
No way.

151
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:07,194
Oh, my God.

152
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:10,665
So here is the pool, there
is the sea, here is the bar.

153
00:12:10,731 --> 00:12:11,966
Oh my God.

154
00:12:12,032 --> 00:12:13,434
Daddy bought it
like 10 years ago.

155
00:12:13,734 --> 00:12:18,640
so, with a little renovation,
well guys, mi casa, su casa.

156
00:12:19,073 --> 00:12:20,741
Except for Ezra, that is.

157
00:12:20,808 --> 00:12:22,409
Ha ha, sucker.

158
00:12:22,476 --> 00:12:23,911
I mean seriously?

159
00:12:23,978 --> 00:12:26,480
Fuck you. You're sleeping
in the maid's quarters.

160
00:12:26,548 --> 00:12:29,551
Well they always hide the
good booze there anyway.

161
00:12:31,686 --> 00:12:33,821
Cool.
Oh my God.

162
00:12:36,857 --> 00:12:38,158
Here, okay.

163
00:12:38,392 --> 00:12:40,729
I'm not sleeping over there.
I'm sleeping there.

164
00:13:06,755 --> 00:13:08,088
I'm skinny dipping tonight.

165
00:13:08,188 --> 00:13:10,592
You're gonna see my
pale ass in this pool.

166
00:13:10,659 --> 00:13:11,760
Your pale ass?

167
00:13:11,825 --> 00:13:13,961
This is the best ever.

168
00:13:14,028 --> 00:13:16,363
This is fucking amazing.

169
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:17,865
Yeah, right.

170
00:13:17,931 --> 00:13:22,637
Anyone up for heading into
town to get this party started?

171
00:13:22,704 --> 00:13:23,738
Yeah, thought you'd never ask.

172
00:13:23,804 --> 00:13:25,205
Do they have Uber here?

173
00:13:25,406 --> 00:13:28,909
No need. This place comes
with toys.

174
00:14:32,272 --> 00:14:37,311
This place is so cool.
There's literally fire.

175
00:14:37,378 --> 00:14:39,213
Guys, I'm gonna go get drinks.
Okay.

176
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,315
Forget drinks.
Let's find some blow.

177
00:14:41,382 --> 00:14:44,251
Daisy, you need
to be careful, okay?

178
00:14:44,318 --> 00:14:45,620
You get caught in
Thailand with drugs,

179
00:14:45,687 --> 00:14:47,254
fast forward 15 years,
you're gonna be

180
00:14:47,321 --> 00:14:49,456
like Clare Danes in
Brokedown Palace.

181
00:14:49,524 --> 00:14:50,457
This is Thailand.

182
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:52,893
Drugs are just as
accessible as rice here.

183
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,895
Just be careful, okay?
Be careful.

184
00:14:54,962 --> 00:14:56,230
That's all I'm saying.

185
00:14:56,296 --> 00:14:58,031
You're the ultimate
buzzkill, okay.

186
00:14:58,098 --> 00:15:00,802
Do you understand that?
I'm good, I'm fine.

187
00:15:00,869 --> 00:15:01,836
Just be careful.

188
00:15:01,902 --> 00:15:03,303
Oh.
Oh!

189
00:15:03,937 --> 00:15:05,740
Shots!

190
00:15:05,807 --> 00:15:07,341
Shots!

191
00:16:05,499 --> 00:16:09,203
Ryder,
Ryder, Ryder, Ryder!

192
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:18,913
Ryder,
Ryder, Ryder,

193
00:16:18,979 --> 00:16:21,281
Ryder, Ryder, Ryder,

194
00:16:21,348 --> 00:16:23,651
Ryder, Ryder, Ryder,

195
00:16:23,718 --> 00:16:26,086
Ryder, Ryder, Ryder,

196
00:16:26,153 --> 00:16:28,288
Ryder, Ryder, Ryder,

197
00:16:28,355 --> 00:16:30,758
Ryder, Ryder, Ryder,

198
00:16:30,825 --> 00:16:33,060
Ryder, Ryder, Ryder,

199
00:16:33,126 --> 00:16:35,597
Ryder, Ryder, Ryder,

200
00:16:35,663 --> 00:16:38,265
Ryder, Ryder, Ryder,

201
00:16:38,332 --> 00:16:40,835
Ryder, Ryder, Ryder!

202
00:16:41,068 --> 00:16:42,570
Here, here, here, here!

203
00:16:42,637 --> 00:16:44,304
Me, me, here, here, here!

204
00:16:53,982 --> 00:16:55,850
Hey, guys.
Hey.

205
00:16:55,917 --> 00:16:57,919
You enjoying your night here?

206
00:16:57,986 --> 00:16:59,521
Oh you could say that.

207
00:16:59,587 --> 00:17:00,989
Well, I was wondering
if you could help me

208
00:17:01,054 --> 00:17:02,389
with a little something.

209
00:17:02,489 --> 00:17:05,459
Anything you need on the
island, we're your girls.

210
00:17:06,093 --> 00:17:07,529
I need some blow.

211
00:17:07,595 --> 00:17:09,531
We never touch
that shit anymore.

212
00:17:11,064 --> 00:17:12,332
Oh fuck off.

213
00:17:24,712 --> 00:17:26,446
Okay, Ezra, that's
our cue to leave.

214
00:17:26,514 --> 00:17:29,283
Hey, fatherfucker,
we're leaving!

215
00:17:29,751 --> 00:17:31,285
You fucked your dad!

216
00:17:31,351 --> 00:17:34,756
No, don't be silly.
I fucked her dad.

217
00:17:34,822 --> 00:17:36,524
Oh my God.
Oh.

218
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,961
Do you know where Daisy is?

219
00:17:40,028 --> 00:17:42,262
Yeah, she went
in this direction.

220
00:17:44,832 --> 00:17:46,133
Daisy.
Daisy.

221
00:17:46,199 --> 00:17:47,635
Daisy?
Daisy?

222
00:17:48,235 --> 00:17:49,637
Daisy.
Daisy.

223
00:17:49,704 --> 00:17:52,172
She's gone. She's not here.

224
00:17:52,239 --> 00:17:53,473
Where the fuck is she?

225
00:17:53,541 --> 00:17:55,375
Maybe she went
back to the villa.

226
00:17:55,442 --> 00:17:58,746
She has no idea where the
villa is. She must be here.

227
00:17:58,813 --> 00:17:59,781
She's searching from coke.

228
00:17:59,847 --> 00:18:01,281
Ezra, shut up.

229
00:18:01,348 --> 00:18:03,183
Guys, let's just find
her and get outta here.

230
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:04,586
I'm like done.

231
00:18:06,588 --> 00:18:07,689
Daisy?

232
00:18:08,856 --> 00:18:10,257
Hey, have you seen my friend?

233
00:18:10,324 --> 00:18:12,492
Pink shirt, dreads.

234
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:15,697
We just saw her walk out with
two big Thai motherfuckers.

235
00:18:16,396 --> 00:18:18,566
You ever heard of
having a girl's back?

236
00:18:21,201 --> 00:18:22,269
So basically I'm
just looking for coke.

237
00:18:22,336 --> 00:18:23,738
Yeah, not the cheap stuff.

238
00:18:23,972 --> 00:18:26,206
Okay, I need the expensive
stuff for me and my friends.

239
00:18:26,273 --> 00:18:27,842
We're not cheap bitches.

240
00:18:27,909 --> 00:18:29,376
Daisy?
Daisy.

241
00:18:29,443 --> 00:18:30,612
Hey, we've been looking for you.

242
00:18:30,812 --> 00:18:32,212
I'm just making a
purchase from these

243
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:34,048
fine gentlemen right here.

244
00:18:34,114 --> 00:18:37,317
That description seems to
be a slight embellishment.

245
00:18:37,384 --> 00:18:40,088
You girls want some party?
Want some company, uh?

246
00:18:40,153 --> 00:18:41,421
No, we don't wanna
fucking party,

247
00:18:41,488 --> 00:18:42,590
and we don't want your company.

248
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:43,925
Okay, come on,
let's get a move on.

249
00:18:44,092 --> 00:18:44,993
Let's get the fuck outta here.

250
00:18:45,192 --> 00:18:46,393
But it's still
going on inside?

251
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:47,862
Daisy, okay, time to go.

252
00:18:47,996 --> 00:18:51,065
Why you be so rude?
We just try to help you out.

253
00:18:51,131 --> 00:18:52,299
Oh, fuck you, assholes.

254
00:18:52,432 --> 00:18:53,801
You're coke dealers,
not missionaries.

255
00:18:53,868 --> 00:18:55,135
Let's go.

256
00:18:55,335 --> 00:18:58,338
Well. Well, we aren't
coke dealers neither.

257
00:18:58,405 --> 00:19:00,173
Now you rich bitches
are gonna give us

258
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,509
all your fucking money.

259
00:19:01,709 --> 00:19:04,378
Look, sirs, you can,
you can have our money.

260
00:19:04,444 --> 00:19:06,213
Okay, but then just
please don't hurt us.

261
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:07,615
Please don't hurt us.

262
00:19:07,682 --> 00:19:10,183
You guys wanna play?
Let's fucking play.

263
00:19:11,853 --> 00:19:13,121
What's going on here?

264
00:19:13,353 --> 00:19:14,689
Jasper?

265
00:19:14,822 --> 00:19:17,659
Get the fuck out of here!
This ain't your problem.

266
00:19:17,725 --> 00:19:18,559
Oh, I think it is.

267
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,293
Hey,.

268
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,863
We don't want
anyone to get hurt.

269
00:19:21,929 --> 00:19:22,964
Okay.

270
00:19:23,031 --> 00:19:25,165
Remember, you asked for this.

271
00:19:25,232 --> 00:19:27,769
Pressing your nose
where it doesn't belong.

272
00:19:31,973 --> 00:19:33,306
Please, don't shoot, okay.

273
00:19:34,942 --> 00:19:36,343
How did you do that?

274
00:19:37,779 --> 00:19:40,213
I guess I watched too many
of your father's movies.

275
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:43,651
Well, you know,
we had this covered.

276
00:19:43,718 --> 00:19:44,886
Thank you.

277
00:19:44,952 --> 00:19:46,420
Thank you so much.

278
00:19:46,587 --> 00:19:48,089
Look, girls, I know you can
take care of yourselves

279
00:19:48,156 --> 00:19:49,991
but this island
can get dangerous,

280
00:19:50,058 --> 00:19:52,760
especially if you girls
are looking for trouble.

281
00:19:53,728 --> 00:19:55,395
You got something
I can write on?

282
00:19:55,462 --> 00:19:57,165
Here.
Okay.

283
00:20:00,034 --> 00:20:02,737
If you need anything,
that's where I'll be.

284
00:20:02,804 --> 00:20:06,306
Pen and paper? This guy is
so old school fucking cool.

285
00:20:06,373 --> 00:20:08,810
Let's go.
Okay, thank you.

286
00:20:08,876 --> 00:20:10,111
Oh my God.

287
00:20:10,444 --> 00:20:12,312
Who are you, Jasper?

288
00:20:13,581 --> 00:20:17,151
I'm just a lonely pilot
trying to enjoy his layover.

289
00:20:17,217 --> 00:20:19,053
Yeah, well you know,
I watched too many

290
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,420
of my dad's films as well,

291
00:20:20,655 --> 00:20:24,058
and I tend to have a
pretty good read on people.

292
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:26,060
A simple thank you will do.

293
00:20:26,127 --> 00:20:30,330
Jasper, I don't believe
you. But thank you.

294
00:20:38,539 --> 00:20:40,340
The bags arrived.

295
00:20:40,407 --> 00:20:42,242
Finally, I can get
out of these clothes.

296
00:20:42,309 --> 00:20:44,045
Why, did you like
shit your pants

297
00:20:44,112 --> 00:20:45,245
when your coke deal went south?

298
00:20:45,312 --> 00:20:46,814
Diamond, lay off her.

299
00:20:46,881 --> 00:20:50,350
I am so tired.
Anyone else wanna swim?

300
00:20:50,417 --> 00:20:51,753
Good idea.

301
00:20:51,886 --> 00:20:53,521
Bring the bags to the
room, put on our suits

302
00:20:53,588 --> 00:20:54,922
and meet you back in five.

303
00:20:54,989 --> 00:20:57,759
Uh uh, uh uh uh, I
wasn't fucking kidding.

304
00:20:57,825 --> 00:20:59,326
You're over there.

305
00:21:02,196 --> 00:21:04,198
Fuck
someone's dad once,

306
00:21:04,264 --> 00:21:07,602
it's like you're
a fucking pariah.

307
00:21:14,274 --> 00:21:16,443
Everybody
get out here!

308
00:21:16,511 --> 00:21:18,411
What the fuck?

309
00:21:20,413 --> 00:21:22,984
Don't even freak out
if you forgot a swimsuit.

310
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:25,418
I have like 20, okay?

311
00:21:25,485 --> 00:21:29,489
No bikini, no
clothes, no nothing.

312
00:21:31,225 --> 00:21:32,160
Holy shit.

313
00:21:32,226 --> 00:21:33,426
Is that real?

314
00:21:33,493 --> 00:21:35,797
I know one way to find out.
Hey.

315
00:21:36,631 --> 00:21:38,900
This bag looks just like mine.

316
00:21:38,966 --> 00:21:40,500
This is nuts, right?

317
00:21:41,235 --> 00:21:42,970
We have to call Jasper.

318
00:21:43,037 --> 00:21:44,337
No, uh-uh.

319
00:21:44,471 --> 00:21:47,241
I'm not quite sure that's
our best move right now.

320
00:21:47,307 --> 00:21:49,376
Our best move?
He just saved our lives.

321
00:21:49,442 --> 00:21:50,978
There is something
off about him.

322
00:21:51,045 --> 00:21:54,982
For all we know, he's got
something to do with this.

323
00:21:55,683 --> 00:21:57,484
You're being
paranoid, Diamond.

324
00:21:57,552 --> 00:21:58,485
Oh, really?

325
00:21:58,553 --> 00:22:00,254
New pilot, first flight,

326
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,623
we know absolutely
nothing about him.

327
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:05,358
Shows up out of nowhere at the
club when we're in trouble.

328
00:22:05,425 --> 00:22:06,794
I mean, he may have
been following us, guys.

329
00:22:06,861 --> 00:22:07,695
I'm just saying.

330
00:22:07,762 --> 00:22:09,429
You know what?
I say we do one.

331
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:11,364
We'll have a night.
Call the cops in the morning
to pick it up,

332
00:22:11,431 --> 00:22:13,701
and we just sort
this shit out then.

333
00:22:13,768 --> 00:22:15,803
- Just one?
- Yeah.

334
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:17,872
Just one.

335
00:22:18,539 --> 00:22:21,408
No, guys, that
is not a good idea.

336
00:22:21,474 --> 00:22:23,077
Just one.

337
00:22:31,384 --> 00:22:32,854
Okay, just one.

338
00:22:33,386 --> 00:22:34,589
Fuck it.

339
00:22:36,157 --> 00:22:37,725
Okay, start it up.

340
00:22:37,792 --> 00:22:39,760
I'm gonna put this
somewhere safe

341
00:22:39,827 --> 00:22:44,198
so Miss Vacuum over there
doesn't get any ideas.

342
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:48,202
Let's turn this shit up.

343
00:24:02,843 --> 00:24:04,111
Oh.

344
00:24:04,345 --> 00:24:06,547
Morning, fuckers.

345
00:24:07,381 --> 00:24:09,050
Morning.

346
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:12,153
I literally feel like
a truck rode over me.

347
00:24:12,219 --> 00:24:13,654
Oh, that can be arranged.

348
00:24:13,788 --> 00:24:16,424
Come on, Diamond, you ever
gonna cut her some slack?

349
00:24:16,489 --> 00:24:17,959
You know it could've been worse.

350
00:24:18,025 --> 00:24:19,894
Yeah? How so?

351
00:24:19,961 --> 00:24:23,030
Well, your dad could have
fallen in love with her,

352
00:24:23,097 --> 00:24:26,067
married her and made
her your evil stepmommy.

353
00:24:26,133 --> 00:24:28,235
And then this
would be my house.

354
00:24:28,302 --> 00:24:30,304
Oh my God, you wish.

355
00:24:31,405 --> 00:24:35,676
Anyway, where's our little
bloodhound?

356
00:24:35,743 --> 00:24:37,511
Did she ever get to bed?

357
00:24:37,578 --> 00:24:39,580
I don't know.
I crashed first.

358
00:24:41,015 --> 00:24:41,749
Mm.

359
00:24:41,816 --> 00:24:43,117
Should we go wake her up?

360
00:24:43,284 --> 00:24:46,320
What is the rush, okay?
Just let her sleep.

361
00:24:46,387 --> 00:24:47,555
God.

362
00:24:47,855 --> 00:24:50,157
- We have a big day planned.
- No.

363
00:24:50,224 --> 00:24:52,460
Daisy, we're coming for ya!

364
00:24:52,526 --> 00:24:54,261
Yes!

365
00:24:54,328 --> 00:24:55,429
Come on.

366
00:24:55,495 --> 00:24:58,199
Oh my, you bitch!

367
00:25:09,944 --> 00:25:11,345
Holy fuck!

368
00:25:11,412 --> 00:25:13,547
Oh my God. Oh my God,
what are we gonna do?

369
00:25:13,614 --> 00:25:15,950
What are we gonna do?
What is happening?
What is happening?

370
00:25:16,017 --> 00:25:17,284
I told you we shouldn't
have touched the bag.

371
00:25:17,351 --> 00:25:18,319
Fuck! Fuck!

372
00:25:18,386 --> 00:25:19,587
We have to do something.

373
00:25:19,787 --> 00:25:21,222
Diamond, Diamond,
we have to call the cops.

374
00:25:21,288 --> 00:25:22,556
We have to call
the cops, Diamond.

375
00:25:23,324 --> 00:25:24,725
Jasper, we need
to call Jasper.
We need to call your father.

376
00:25:24,792 --> 00:25:25,993
Your father would
know what to do.

377
00:25:26,227 --> 00:25:28,095
Your dad would definitely
know what to do.
Shh.

378
00:25:29,597 --> 00:25:32,500
If we call the cops,
she's dead.

379
00:25:32,933 --> 00:25:36,270
If we call my father,
she's dead.

380
00:25:36,337 --> 00:25:39,573
If we call anyone, she's dead.

381
00:25:40,241 --> 00:25:41,776
We need to handle this.

382
00:25:44,045 --> 00:25:45,546
Diamond.
We need to handle this.

383
00:25:45,613 --> 00:25:46,781
Diamond.

384
00:25:46,847 --> 00:25:48,449
How are we gonna handle this?

385
00:25:48,517 --> 00:25:50,418
I can't even handle it.

386
00:26:26,187 --> 00:26:28,557
Diamond, this isn't one of
your dad's fucking movies.

387
00:26:28,622 --> 00:26:30,424
This is real life.

388
00:26:30,491 --> 00:26:32,359
Get serious.
I am serious.

389
00:26:32,426 --> 00:26:35,396
If what I say isn't
exactly what happens,

390
00:26:35,463 --> 00:26:36,697
then go ahead, call the cops.

391
00:26:36,764 --> 00:26:38,199
What are you talking about?

392
00:26:38,265 --> 00:26:40,668
We're going to get
a call any minute.

393
00:26:40,734 --> 00:26:42,903
Ezra, you're gonna
answer the phone.

394
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:45,306
Read exactly what I wrote.

395
00:26:45,372 --> 00:26:47,708
And then just, just hang up.

396
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:50,244
This is not a fucking film.

397
00:26:55,716 --> 00:26:57,184
Answer it.

398
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:00,454
Answer it.

399
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:12,066
We have what you want.

400
00:27:14,068 --> 00:27:19,406
But, we also have a very
particular set of skills.

401
00:27:20,374 --> 00:27:24,111
Skills that we've acquired
over the years of our careers.

402
00:27:25,913 --> 00:27:29,316
Skills that make us a
nightmare for people like you.

403
00:27:30,585 --> 00:27:34,321
If you let our friend go now,
that'll be the end of it.

404
00:27:34,722 --> 00:27:36,390
We will not pursue you.

405
00:27:37,358 --> 00:27:38,926
But if you don't,

406
00:27:39,628 --> 00:27:41,295
we will look for you.

407
00:27:42,229 --> 00:27:43,731
We will find you.

408
00:27:44,465 --> 00:27:46,601
And we will kill you.

409
00:27:51,071 --> 00:27:54,208
That was fucking
awesome!

410
00:27:55,342 --> 00:27:56,744
You guys believe me now?

411
00:27:56,810 --> 00:27:58,279
Diamond, what have we
gotten ourselves into?

412
00:27:58,345 --> 00:28:00,181
I know, but fuck this.

413
00:28:01,081 --> 00:28:02,816
We're gonna go save Daisy.

414
00:28:06,353 --> 00:28:07,488
Okay.

415
00:28:08,923 --> 00:28:12,026
Okay, let's just break
down what happened.

416
00:28:12,092 --> 00:28:15,396
When the plane landed, somehow
Ryder's bag got mixed up

417
00:28:15,462 --> 00:28:17,398
with some kind of drug shipment.

418
00:28:18,667 --> 00:28:19,934
Whew.

419
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,570
Now, who could have done this?

420
00:28:21,636 --> 00:28:24,539
There were only two other
people than us on the plane.

421
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,142
But Jasper saved us.

422
00:28:28,209 --> 00:28:30,411
No, for all we know,
he was following us

423
00:28:30,477 --> 00:28:32,213
to find the missing bag.

424
00:28:32,279 --> 00:28:35,983
We can't trust him.
We can't trust anyone.

425
00:28:38,553 --> 00:28:42,256
Okay, they come in last night
looking for their product.

426
00:28:42,323 --> 00:28:45,326
They couldn't find it, so
they take collateral, Daisy.

427
00:28:47,761 --> 00:28:49,564
This is seriously nuts.

428
00:28:49,631 --> 00:28:51,165
We have what they want.

429
00:28:51,232 --> 00:28:53,434
Well, they have what we want.

430
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:54,902
Who is they?

431
00:28:54,969 --> 00:28:56,904
It's a golden triangle.

432
00:28:57,471 --> 00:28:59,173
What is a golden triangle?

433
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,375
It's the area where
the borders of Laos,

434
00:29:01,442 --> 00:29:03,210
Myanmar and Thailand meet.

435
00:29:03,277 --> 00:29:05,513
One of the world's busiest
drug trafficking regions,

436
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:09,116
and, guys, we've just
fucked with the balance

437
00:29:09,183 --> 00:29:11,318
of the Thai's drug cartel.

438
00:29:11,385 --> 00:29:13,387
Oh shit! Oh fuck.

439
00:29:13,454 --> 00:29:14,689
Oh my God.

440
00:29:16,023 --> 00:29:18,125
So what's our next move?

441
00:29:18,192 --> 00:29:20,127
They will contact us
and deliver instructions

442
00:29:20,194 --> 00:29:22,162
for the drop and
trade for Daisy.

443
00:29:22,229 --> 00:29:25,499
Likely somewhere in town
with lots of people around.

444
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:28,703
Diamond, this is all just
like a little bit too much,

445
00:29:28,769 --> 00:29:31,138
but I don't think that growing
up on your dad's movie sets

446
00:29:31,205 --> 00:29:34,275
makes you exactly qualified
or me exactly qualified

447
00:29:34,341 --> 00:29:37,746
to, you know, do a
hostage rescue situation.

448
00:29:37,811 --> 00:29:39,714
Yeah, I'm with her.

449
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:41,282
You have to believe me.

450
00:29:41,348 --> 00:29:44,018
I know we all love Daisy
and we need her back safe,

451
00:29:44,084 --> 00:29:45,520
but at this point,

452
00:29:47,589 --> 00:29:49,290
the only ones that
are going to be able

453
00:29:49,356 --> 00:29:52,192
to do this are the three of us.

454
00:29:55,429 --> 00:29:56,665
I do have one
question, though.

455
00:29:56,731 --> 00:29:57,931
Yeah, so do I.

456
00:29:58,098 --> 00:30:00,234
Where's the blow?
Where's the cocaine?

457
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:02,771
Follow me.

458
00:30:13,748 --> 00:30:15,617
What is this?

459
00:30:15,684 --> 00:30:17,084
Panic room.

460
00:30:17,284 --> 00:30:19,521
Okay, so you tell us now
that you have a panic room?

461
00:30:20,254 --> 00:30:22,289
Because this is like
a totally normal thing

462
00:30:22,356 --> 00:30:24,592
that one has in
the house, right?

463
00:30:27,428 --> 00:30:28,395
What up?

464
00:30:28,462 --> 00:30:30,097
This is fucking awesome.

465
00:30:30,164 --> 00:30:32,600
That's a lot of guns.

466
00:30:33,033 --> 00:30:34,335
What is that?

467
00:30:34,435 --> 00:30:37,505
Oh, that's a Replicator.
It's a 3-D printer.

468
00:30:37,572 --> 00:30:40,240
This is fucking badass!

469
00:30:40,709 --> 00:30:42,409
Okay, why does Daddy...

470
00:30:44,211 --> 00:30:46,113
What does your daddy
have one of these?

471
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:49,584
Uh, because he's rich and
famous and his life has value.

472
00:30:49,651 --> 00:30:51,885
He builds these panic
rooms for us everywhere.

473
00:30:51,952 --> 00:30:53,921
Like, gives him peace of mind.

474
00:30:54,922 --> 00:30:56,990
And here it is.

475
00:30:57,358 --> 00:30:59,326
No one knows about this room.

476
00:30:59,393 --> 00:31:01,895
There is no way of
finding it, tracking it.

477
00:31:01,962 --> 00:31:03,497
It's basically invisible.

478
00:31:05,299 --> 00:31:06,568
Diamond, what are we gonna do?

479
00:31:07,602 --> 00:31:10,505
We're going to town and act
as if nothing has happened.

480
00:31:10,572 --> 00:31:12,039
We don't alert anyone.

481
00:31:12,106 --> 00:31:13,641
They will find us and
deliver instructions

482
00:31:13,708 --> 00:31:15,075
for the drop and
trade for Daisy.

483
00:31:15,142 --> 00:31:17,277
Okay, and then what next?

484
00:31:17,344 --> 00:31:21,148
Then the shit, all gets real.

485
00:31:23,083 --> 00:31:25,720
Who fucking has one of these?

486
00:31:25,787 --> 00:31:27,488
I bail.

487
00:31:38,232 --> 00:31:39,333
There's so many people.

488
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,636
Are you sure this
was a good idea?

489
00:31:41,703 --> 00:31:43,170
Three beers please.

490
00:31:43,370 --> 00:31:45,874
Okay, I'm with Ezra. How are
we gonna do this on our own?

491
00:31:45,939 --> 00:31:47,675
By staying calm.

492
00:31:47,742 --> 00:31:49,209
I'm so stressed out.

493
00:31:49,309 --> 00:31:52,413
Look, if it was just one of us,
we would be in deep shit.

494
00:31:52,479 --> 00:31:55,817
If it was just two of us,
we would be totally fucked.

495
00:31:55,884 --> 00:31:57,552
But the three of us together,

496
00:31:57,619 --> 00:32:00,822
we make up one pretty
fucking lethal weapon.

497
00:32:00,889 --> 00:32:02,289
How do you figure?

498
00:32:02,356 --> 00:32:06,927
We have the brains,
the body and the bimbo.

499
00:32:07,461 --> 00:32:08,996
Go on, yeah.

500
00:32:09,062 --> 00:32:11,666
I have lived every
one of my dad's films.

501
00:32:11,733 --> 00:32:15,135
I know these guys, what
they think, how they plan.

502
00:32:15,202 --> 00:32:17,471
I know their moves
before they do.

503
00:32:17,539 --> 00:32:19,239
I'm the brains.

504
00:32:19,973 --> 00:32:21,375
Ryder, you are the body.

505
00:32:21,442 --> 00:32:23,243
Your years of avoiding
anything in life that

506
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:26,146
is actually fun and
focusing all your energy

507
00:32:26,213 --> 00:32:27,649
on those extreme sporty things

508
00:32:27,715 --> 00:32:30,017
gives you a leg up
on these cocksuckers.

509
00:32:30,083 --> 00:32:33,353
When we need some
physical action, it's you.

510
00:32:34,421 --> 00:32:36,423
Oh, so that
makes me the bimbo.

511
00:32:38,158 --> 00:32:40,127
And what exactly do
you mean by that?

512
00:32:40,194 --> 00:32:41,995
It means, you're an actor.

513
00:32:42,062 --> 00:32:44,398
You're our voice.

514
00:32:44,465 --> 00:32:47,434
The words we say need to
come convincingly from you.

515
00:32:49,002 --> 00:32:52,973
Yeah, I can do that but I'm
really fucking stressed out.

516
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,441
I'm literally panicking.

517
00:32:55,543 --> 00:32:56,845
Chill.

518
00:33:03,585 --> 00:33:04,519
What did he say?

519
00:33:04,586 --> 00:33:06,153
Fuck do I know?

520
00:33:09,824 --> 00:33:13,528
The boy is saying the
daisies are in full bloom.

521
00:33:13,595 --> 00:33:15,162
No they're not.
They're like wilted.

522
00:33:15,229 --> 00:33:17,665
Buy the flowers.
Buy them now, buy them.

523
00:33:17,732 --> 00:33:18,999
Oh shit.

524
00:33:19,066 --> 00:33:20,400
Uh.

525
00:33:21,870 --> 00:33:23,571
Thank you.
Thank you.

526
00:33:28,676 --> 00:33:30,310
What do we do?

527
00:33:30,377 --> 00:33:31,445
Open it.

528
00:33:31,513 --> 00:33:32,547
Carefully.

529
00:33:32,614 --> 00:33:33,715
Me?

530
00:33:34,181 --> 00:33:35,449
I don't want to.

531
00:33:36,518 --> 00:33:37,317
Could be a bomb.

532
00:33:37,384 --> 00:33:39,521
Shut up.
Just do it.

533
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:44,526
What is it?

534
00:33:44,592 --> 00:33:46,393
Oh, shit.

535
00:33:47,227 --> 00:33:48,663
Come over.

536
00:33:52,534 --> 00:33:55,537
Turn it on.
No, no. No.

537
00:33:56,303 --> 00:33:58,238
Turn it on carefully.

538
00:34:12,921 --> 00:34:15,255
This here is a banana spider.

539
00:34:16,456 --> 00:34:19,794
It is the most venomous
spider in the world.

540
00:34:20,294 --> 00:34:22,262
There is no antivenom.

541
00:34:22,329 --> 00:34:24,799
So I suggest that
you don't move.

542
00:34:29,671 --> 00:34:31,706
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

543
00:34:33,875 --> 00:34:35,677
<i>Come on, baby.</i>

544
00:34:35,743 --> 00:34:36,778
<i>There we go.</i>

545
00:34:45,587 --> 00:34:48,255
Okay. Listen to me carefully.

546
00:34:49,089 --> 00:34:52,492
<i>Go to the Fountain</i>
<i>Circle at Old Geptown.</i>

547
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:56,229
<i>There you will see</i>
<i>a big banyan tree.</i>

548
00:34:56,296 --> 00:34:59,499
<i>Be on the bench next</i>
<i>to it tomorrow at noon.</i>

549
00:34:59,567 --> 00:35:03,303
Bring the product, and
I'll bring your friend.

550
00:35:11,746 --> 00:35:13,881
Oh my God. Oh my God.

551
00:35:13,948 --> 00:35:15,550
This is so fucked up.

552
00:35:16,818 --> 00:35:20,253
If anything happens to Daisy,
if anything happens--

553
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,856
She will be fine.

554
00:35:22,757 --> 00:35:23,758
Okay.

555
00:35:23,825 --> 00:35:25,994
She is really strong.

556
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:28,863
Okay, we're just gonna
follow their instructions and...

557
00:35:29,697 --> 00:35:31,666
by this time tomorrow
Daisy will be back with us

558
00:35:31,733 --> 00:35:35,302
and we can get
the fuck out of here.

559
00:35:38,338 --> 00:35:39,607
She's right.

560
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:42,977
Let's just get back to the
villa and plan for tomorrow.

561
00:35:43,044 --> 00:35:44,411
Oh my God, Ezra.

562
00:35:44,478 --> 00:35:46,614
I am sorry.
You need to be clear of mind.

563
00:35:46,681 --> 00:35:47,882
Come on.

564
00:36:04,599 --> 00:36:06,668
We need to get
ready for tomorrow.

565
00:36:06,734 --> 00:36:08,335
Always be prepared
for the worst.

566
00:36:09,403 --> 00:36:10,705
Yeah, and what's that?

567
00:36:11,371 --> 00:36:13,407
These guys don't
give a shit about us.

568
00:36:13,473 --> 00:36:15,510
As soon as they get
their stuff back,

569
00:36:15,576 --> 00:36:17,745
we no longer have
any value to them.

570
00:36:17,812 --> 00:36:19,847
We can't trust
anything they say.

571
00:36:19,914 --> 00:36:21,783
They will try to cheat us.

572
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:24,986
And then what?

573
00:36:25,053 --> 00:36:26,286
Plan B.

574
00:36:26,353 --> 00:36:28,288
What's Plan B?

575
00:36:28,355 --> 00:36:30,992
That is a very good
question I don't have

576
00:36:31,059 --> 00:36:32,627
the answer to right now.

577
00:36:32,694 --> 00:36:36,030
Anyway, tomorrow, Ryder,
you will do the drop.

578
00:36:36,097 --> 00:36:38,599
Ezra and I will find vantage
points where we can see

579
00:36:38,666 --> 00:36:40,635
everything that's going on.

580
00:36:40,702 --> 00:36:42,503
We'll be your eyes and ears.

581
00:36:43,370 --> 00:36:44,772
Eyes and ears.

582
00:36:47,207 --> 00:36:48,475
So what next?

583
00:36:49,409 --> 00:36:50,778
Target practice.

584
00:36:51,646 --> 00:36:53,948
Are you fucking kidding me?

585
00:36:54,015 --> 00:36:55,348
Okay, ladies, now,

586
00:36:55,415 --> 00:36:58,119
the most important thing
when you're firing a gun

587
00:36:58,186 --> 00:37:00,420
is your breath.

588
00:37:00,487 --> 00:37:02,355
Control your breathing
to keep yourself steady.

589
00:37:04,324 --> 00:37:07,662
Take aim through here and
slowly pull the trigger.

590
00:37:09,396 --> 00:37:11,666
You need to be gentle.

591
00:37:11,733 --> 00:37:14,969
Slow. It's the foreplay
before the fuck.

592
00:37:19,741 --> 00:37:21,374
Why doesn't that surprise me?

593
00:37:21,441 --> 00:37:23,711
Years of working on
that bullshit cop show,

594
00:37:23,778 --> 00:37:25,513
and still nothing
to show for it.

595
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:28,381
Okay, let me make
this easy for you.

596
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:30,383
Hold the rifle steadily.

597
00:37:30,450 --> 00:37:33,721
Put the butt firmly into
the pocket of your shoulder.

598
00:37:33,788 --> 00:37:35,089
Relax your body.

599
00:37:35,156 --> 00:37:38,126
Aim that little dot where
you want the bullet to go.

600
00:37:38,192 --> 00:37:39,527
And fire.

601
00:37:43,664 --> 00:37:44,632
Okay.

602
00:37:45,099 --> 00:37:47,568
Are you positive that we should
be handling these things?

603
00:37:47,635 --> 00:37:49,570
Like what, what makes
you such an expert

604
00:37:49,637 --> 00:37:52,740
on this, Diamond, like
playing with your dad's toys?

605
00:37:52,807 --> 00:37:54,374
Dad's toys?

606
00:37:59,747 --> 00:38:03,416
Yeah, I suppose so.
Get some sleep, ladies.

607
00:38:11,926 --> 00:38:14,562
Do you think it's
gonna be hot on the roof?

608
00:38:17,165 --> 00:38:18,398
It's showtime.

609
00:38:18,465 --> 00:38:20,268
Yeah, but can we please,
like, be careful?

610
00:38:20,333 --> 00:38:22,804
Yeah, sure.
Whatever, Mom.

611
00:38:22,870 --> 00:38:24,337
What's in the bag?

612
00:38:25,506 --> 00:38:27,141
More toys.

613
00:38:27,208 --> 00:38:28,709
You ready?

614
00:38:28,776 --> 00:38:30,011
Let's go.

615
00:38:31,478 --> 00:38:33,614
She's fucking crazy.

616
00:38:59,339 --> 00:39:02,442
Come to Thailand,
it'll be sick.

617
00:39:02,510 --> 00:39:04,145
It'll be a blast.

618
00:39:04,212 --> 00:39:06,379
Oh Ryder, you're
doing just fine.

619
00:39:06,446 --> 00:39:08,015
<i>Just take a seat on the bench.</i>

620
00:39:15,156 --> 00:39:17,390
<i>You look great, by the way.</i>

621
00:39:28,803 --> 00:39:30,905
Shit, there's a phone here.

622
00:39:31,873 --> 00:39:33,040
What do I do?

623
00:39:33,107 --> 00:39:34,141
Answer it.

624
00:39:34,208 --> 00:39:36,310
<i>Don't speak, just listen.</i>

625
00:39:41,549 --> 00:39:42,683
<i>There's a black van that's</i>

626
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:45,152
pulling into the
square right now.

627
00:39:45,219 --> 00:39:46,386
<i>Look to your left.</i>

628
00:39:52,093 --> 00:39:55,696
<i>Also, there's a trash</i>
<i>bin beyond the tree.</i>

629
00:39:56,831 --> 00:39:58,799
<i>Drop the duffel</i>
<i>bag into the bin,</i>

630
00:39:59,233 --> 00:40:00,735
and we'll let your friend go.

631
00:40:05,139 --> 00:40:06,374
Something does not feel right.

632
00:40:06,574 --> 00:40:08,342
Ryder, just put the
drugs in the trash bin

633
00:40:08,408 --> 00:40:09,476
<i>and let's get Daisy home.</i>

634
00:40:25,626 --> 00:40:27,161
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

635
00:40:37,104 --> 00:40:38,539
It's not her!

636
00:40:38,606 --> 00:40:40,107
Shit, run!

637
00:40:45,079 --> 00:40:46,113
Okay, let's go.

638
00:41:19,981 --> 00:41:21,582
Stop, stop, stop!

639
00:42:19,273 --> 00:42:21,409
Ah! Fuckers!

640
00:42:21,475 --> 00:42:22,843
We are in way over our heads,

641
00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:25,079
and we need to
call the cops now!

642
00:42:25,146 --> 00:42:26,447
No cops, Ezra.

643
00:42:26,515 --> 00:42:27,782
Diamond's right.

644
00:42:27,982 --> 00:42:29,784
These assholes fucked
with the wrong girls.

645
00:42:29,850 --> 00:42:31,318
Payback's gonna be a bitch.

646
00:42:31,419 --> 00:42:34,088
Okay, tough guy, one problem.
We have no leverage.

647
00:42:34,155 --> 00:42:37,158
They have Daisy and now
they also have the cocaine.

648
00:42:37,224 --> 00:42:38,893
Fuck, she's right.

649
00:42:42,363 --> 00:42:43,664
We're fucking screwed.

650
00:42:46,333 --> 00:42:47,568
Holy shit.

651
00:42:47,635 --> 00:42:49,236
Holy shit.

652
00:42:49,336 --> 00:42:52,640
Yeah, they were never going
to just hand Daisy back to us.

653
00:42:52,706 --> 00:42:54,642
This was always the first
step in getting her back.

654
00:42:54,708 --> 00:42:56,844
That's how I knew it
wasn't Daisy today.

655
00:42:56,911 --> 00:42:59,814
Bold move D-dog,
you gonna tell us or?

656
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:01,816
I needed you guys
to be convincing.

657
00:43:01,882 --> 00:43:03,084
Okay, I just, I need a break.

658
00:43:03,150 --> 00:43:05,086
I am so stressed out right now.

659
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:08,823
Wait, if the coke
was here, then--

660
00:43:08,889 --> 00:43:10,424
What was in the
bag I gave them?

661
00:43:10,559 --> 00:43:13,360
Oh, it was just filled with
Ezra's panties, bras and all.

662
00:43:14,829 --> 00:43:16,397
Okay, so are we even now?

663
00:43:16,464 --> 00:43:18,766
Not even.
But we're getting there.

664
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:22,269
All right, what's next?
Plan B.

665
00:43:24,672 --> 00:43:26,173
What are you thinking?

666
00:43:26,474 --> 00:43:29,643
<i>Of the Thai drug cartel, an</i>
<i>avid supporter of Muay Thai</i>

667
00:43:29,710 --> 00:43:32,980
<i>Koon has been rumored to be</i>
<i>training his prizefighter</i>

668
00:43:33,047 --> 00:43:37,084
<i>known as Goliath in a</i>
<i>completely unconventional way.</i>

669
00:43:37,151 --> 00:43:39,820
Pause it. Pause it,
pause it, pause it.

670
00:43:41,590 --> 00:43:42,990
What are you thinking?

671
00:43:44,425 --> 00:43:45,926
Tomorrow at the fight club,

672
00:43:45,993 --> 00:43:48,563
we're gonna kidnap the head
of Thai's drug cartel.

673
00:43:48,629 --> 00:43:49,763
and trade him for Daisy.

674
00:43:49,830 --> 00:43:52,032
What the fuck?
What the fuck?

675
00:43:52,099 --> 00:43:54,335
You've lost your mind.
You've lost your mind.

676
00:43:54,401 --> 00:43:56,003
No, I'm down.

677
00:43:56,070 --> 00:43:57,905
I'll do whatever it
takes to get Daisy back.

678
00:43:57,972 --> 00:44:00,609
Good to know.
We've gotta start stretching.

679
00:44:00,674 --> 00:44:02,443
Fine, what's the plan?

680
00:44:02,511 --> 00:44:05,514
Ezra, are you still
shooting up that teen tox?

681
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:08,082
What?

682
00:44:10,384 --> 00:44:11,318
Now and then.

683
00:44:11,385 --> 00:44:12,753
Oh.

684
00:44:14,054 --> 00:44:15,557
Go grab your syringes.

685
00:44:15,823 --> 00:44:19,193
Then go to Daisy's room and
take all of her sleeping pills.

686
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:22,163
Ryder, you know how to
work that 3-D printer?

687
00:44:22,229 --> 00:44:23,497
Fuck yeah.

688
00:44:23,664 --> 00:44:27,268
Okay, it's time to kiss my
Balmain latex one-piece goodbye.

689
00:44:27,334 --> 00:44:28,702
Why?

690
00:44:28,769 --> 00:44:30,204
Trust me.

691
00:44:30,404 --> 00:44:31,705
Okay, let's go.

692
00:44:31,772 --> 00:44:32,973
Okay.

693
00:45:03,237 --> 00:45:07,408
<i>In our path, he will</i>
<i>be the next undis--</i>

694
00:45:37,171 --> 00:45:38,540
I really hope
you don't expect us

695
00:45:38,607 --> 00:45:39,641
to go out with you tonight.

696
00:45:39,708 --> 00:45:41,809
No. I don't want us to go out.

697
00:45:41,875 --> 00:45:43,310
Great, great.

698
00:45:43,377 --> 00:45:44,512
I'm going out.

699
00:45:44,579 --> 00:45:45,746
What?

700
00:45:45,813 --> 00:45:47,014
I'm seeing Jasper.

701
00:45:47,081 --> 00:45:48,482
Oh.
You really think tonight

702
00:45:48,550 --> 00:45:49,883
is the time for you

703
00:45:49,950 --> 00:45:52,152
to dip your butt
back to the dating pool?

704
00:45:52,219 --> 00:45:55,956
Well, you know, there's
something off about him.

705
00:45:56,023 --> 00:45:58,392
Something he's not telling us.

706
00:45:58,459 --> 00:46:02,196
And you're gonna use your
vagina to get it outta him?

707
00:46:04,633 --> 00:46:06,133
No, babe.

708
00:46:06,701 --> 00:46:08,802
But for all we know, he's got
something to do with this.

709
00:46:08,869 --> 00:46:11,038
So, you know what they say,

710
00:46:11,105 --> 00:46:13,742
keep your friends close but
keep your enemies closer.

711
00:46:14,509 --> 00:46:18,245
Yeah, you know what they
also say? Don't fuck the enemy.

712
00:46:19,446 --> 00:46:20,814
Focus on tomorrow.

713
00:46:21,015 --> 00:46:24,485
Make sure you understand
exactly what needs to be done.

714
00:46:24,552 --> 00:46:27,321
We mess up, we're all dead.

715
00:46:27,388 --> 00:46:28,623
Don't wait up.

716
00:46:48,275 --> 00:46:51,378
Wow.
You clean up nice.

717
00:46:51,445 --> 00:46:53,981
And you barely
cleaned up at all.

718
00:46:54,048 --> 00:46:56,450
Vodka martini,
shaken, not stirred.

719
00:47:00,655 --> 00:47:03,558
So, are you surprised I called?

720
00:47:04,491 --> 00:47:05,527
No.

721
00:47:06,327 --> 00:47:07,294
I'm not.

722
00:47:07,361 --> 00:47:08,797
I'm more surprised you called

723
00:47:08,896 --> 00:47:11,031
and you're not in
some kind of trouble.

724
00:47:11,465 --> 00:47:12,499
Funny.

725
00:47:14,101 --> 00:47:16,036
How's the trip going so far?

726
00:47:17,338 --> 00:47:20,074
Mm, could be better.
Could be worse.

727
00:47:20,841 --> 00:47:22,209
Right.

728
00:47:24,378 --> 00:47:25,979
What about Daisy?

729
00:47:27,114 --> 00:47:30,217
Daisy seemed a little
shaken up the other night.

730
00:47:31,820 --> 00:47:34,188
Daisy, you know, she's Daisy.

731
00:47:34,254 --> 00:47:36,924
Always seems to
get in trouble, but

732
00:47:36,990 --> 00:47:39,293
always finds her way out.

733
00:47:40,027 --> 00:47:41,261
Cheers.

734
00:47:41,796 --> 00:47:43,163
Right.

735
00:47:45,165 --> 00:47:47,535
What's your deal, Diamond?

736
00:47:48,135 --> 00:47:51,205
I feel like there's a lot
going on inside of you that

737
00:47:51,271 --> 00:47:53,440
you don't allow people to see.

738
00:47:54,108 --> 00:47:55,810
There's always more.

739
00:47:55,876 --> 00:47:57,545
Okay, go on.

740
00:47:59,446 --> 00:48:03,818
Look, everyone thinks
growing up in Hollywood,

741
00:48:03,884 --> 00:48:05,386
jumping around the world,

742
00:48:05,452 --> 00:48:09,223
they think this life
is a dream come true.

743
00:48:10,057 --> 00:48:11,526
And in so many ways it is.

744
00:48:12,827 --> 00:48:16,430
But, my mom left
when I was a kid.

745
00:48:17,632 --> 00:48:20,735
One night she just
packed up and was gone.

746
00:48:20,802 --> 00:48:22,469
No goodbyes, nothing.

747
00:48:24,204 --> 00:48:28,275
My dad took it really hard.
He struggled for years.

748
00:48:28,976 --> 00:48:31,278
He put all his
energy into his work,

749
00:48:31,345 --> 00:48:34,415
and nothing else mattered.

750
00:48:35,517 --> 00:48:37,117
Not even me.

751
00:48:38,653 --> 00:48:41,589
I guess work became his drug and

752
00:48:41,656 --> 00:48:45,325
then it was success,
and now it's the girls.

753
00:48:45,392 --> 00:48:47,595
Trying to make him
feel young again.

754
00:48:49,029 --> 00:48:52,499
And, in the midst of all this,

755
00:48:53,434 --> 00:48:55,202
I had to grow up on my own.

756
00:48:56,905 --> 00:49:01,408
Figure out who I really am
and what I really want and

757
00:49:02,677 --> 00:49:04,111
I think I'm still trying.

758
00:49:06,113 --> 00:49:08,482
I think you're doing
a pretty good job.

759
00:49:13,053 --> 00:49:14,455
You wanna take a walk?

760
00:49:16,691 --> 00:49:18,158
Mm-hm.

761
00:49:19,259 --> 00:49:21,962
So, what's your deal, Jasper?

762
00:49:22,029 --> 00:49:23,130
Me?

763
00:49:23,330 --> 00:49:25,265
Yeah, the man
with many questions

764
00:49:25,332 --> 00:49:27,301
and never a single answer.

765
00:49:27,702 --> 00:49:29,102
Um.

766
00:49:32,005 --> 00:49:34,975
There's not really much
glitz and glamor in my life.

767
00:49:35,042 --> 00:49:36,711
I mean...

768
00:49:37,579 --> 00:49:39,747
my parents split
up when I was young

769
00:49:39,814 --> 00:49:44,418
and, careful, my dad
was a New York cop.

770
00:49:44,485 --> 00:49:45,920
Mm?

771
00:49:45,986 --> 00:49:49,356
My mom took
a cushy job in LA and

772
00:49:49,891 --> 00:49:52,927
kinda, just like you,
was fending for my own.

773
00:49:52,993 --> 00:49:54,061
Right?

774
00:49:54,261 --> 00:49:56,363
We had enough to
make ends meet, but

775
00:49:57,297 --> 00:50:00,167
pretty much raised
myself, you know.

776
00:50:00,234 --> 00:50:04,304
Don't know if I did a good job,

777
00:50:05,005 --> 00:50:07,675
but yeah, flying is

778
00:50:08,710 --> 00:50:11,546
the only thing that
made me feel free.

779
00:50:12,714 --> 00:50:16,751
Flying up there, high
above my troubles.

780
00:50:19,386 --> 00:50:20,454
I guess we have more in common

781
00:50:20,522 --> 00:50:22,055
with each other than we thought.

782
00:50:22,122 --> 00:50:23,423
Yeah.

783
00:52:10,064 --> 00:52:12,432
Shit, it's Ryder's bag.

784
00:52:14,301 --> 00:52:15,302
Fucker.

785
00:52:39,060 --> 00:52:42,964
Wow, well that
was a long drink.

786
00:52:43,031 --> 00:52:44,431
Fuck you.

787
00:52:44,632 --> 00:52:47,467
I see what you mean about
keeping the enemies close.

788
00:52:47,535 --> 00:52:51,238
Did you find
anything out at least?

789
00:52:51,304 --> 00:52:55,043
Yeah, I found out
we can't trust Jasper.

790
00:52:55,109 --> 00:52:56,711
Oh, shit.

791
00:52:57,145 --> 00:52:59,379
You have
all the supplies?

792
00:52:59,446 --> 00:53:01,149
- Yeah.
- You got everything?

793
00:53:01,214 --> 00:53:02,482
Mm-hm.
Everything.

794
00:53:02,617 --> 00:53:04,284
You understand exactly
what we're doing?

795
00:53:04,351 --> 00:53:06,754
Diamond, we're fine.

796
00:53:08,556 --> 00:53:10,892
Follow the plan,
we get Daisy back.

797
00:53:11,626 --> 00:53:14,261
Follow the plan,
we get Daisy back.

798
00:53:14,327 --> 00:53:16,964
Follow the plan,
we get Daisy back.

799
00:53:33,581 --> 00:53:36,316
Another victim
falls to our Goliath.

800
00:53:36,383 --> 00:53:39,319
There is no obstacle
in our path.

801
00:53:39,386 --> 00:53:43,256
He will be the next
undisputed champion.

802
00:53:43,524 --> 00:53:45,660
He is unstoppable.

803
00:53:45,727 --> 00:53:49,329
Another day, and he's
destroyed everyone in sight.

804
00:53:52,567 --> 00:53:54,468
Got time for one more?

805
00:53:56,804 --> 00:53:57,939
A woman?

806
00:53:58,906 --> 00:54:01,274
Here's our buy-in.
Ryder, go get ready.

807
00:54:03,711 --> 00:54:06,581
You just bought a ticket
for your friend's funeral.

808
00:54:08,348 --> 00:54:09,584
Do you have a name?

809
00:54:09,650 --> 00:54:10,852
Diamond.

810
00:54:11,119 --> 00:54:12,053
Just Diamond?

811
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:13,386
Just Diamond.

812
00:54:13,521 --> 00:54:15,489
And what brings you to
my country, Just Diamond?

813
00:54:15,556 --> 00:54:17,191
I'm here on vacation.

814
00:54:17,290 --> 00:54:19,127
And how has that been so far?

815
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:21,428
Pretty uneventful.

816
00:54:21,896 --> 00:54:24,297
We'll certainly have
to change that, won't we?

817
00:54:28,903 --> 00:54:30,104
I'm counting on that.

818
00:54:43,684 --> 00:54:46,053
I'll be gracious and
keep all your money.

819
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:47,354
Tell your friend to go home.

820
00:54:47,420 --> 00:54:48,923
She has nothing to prove.

821
00:54:49,056 --> 00:54:51,259
Perhaps we can get to know
each other a little better.

822
00:54:51,324 --> 00:54:55,229
How about I make
you that same offer?

823
00:55:17,985 --> 00:55:20,588
I've been saving this
for a special occasion.

824
00:55:21,289 --> 00:55:22,256
You found it.

825
00:56:03,463 --> 00:56:05,365
The end is near for your friend.

826
00:56:06,167 --> 00:56:07,768
Shall we double the wager?

827
00:56:07,835 --> 00:56:11,906
Diamond, you shine
bright, but clearly flawed.

828
00:57:07,460 --> 00:57:09,063
I've never lost in anything.

829
00:57:15,036 --> 00:57:16,170
Let's fuck.

830
00:57:35,156 --> 00:57:36,824
What kind of girl
do you think I am?

831
00:57:36,891 --> 00:57:39,226
Ryder, grab your shit
and let's get out of here.

832
00:58:00,114 --> 00:58:02,550
Did you really think you
would leave without me?

833
00:58:02,616 --> 00:58:04,051
Get in.

834
00:58:08,189 --> 00:58:09,690
I thought you'd never ask.

835
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:14,261
Let's go.

836
00:58:18,632 --> 00:58:20,134
Holy fuck, we did it.

837
00:58:20,568 --> 00:58:22,036
My heart's about to explode.

838
00:58:22,103 --> 00:58:24,338
Guys, this is still
so far from over.

839
00:58:24,405 --> 00:58:26,874
How many sleeping pills did
you shoot him up with?

840
00:58:26,941 --> 00:58:28,776
Enough.

841
00:59:16,957 --> 00:59:19,427
Who the fuck are you, girls?

842
00:59:19,493 --> 00:59:21,395
Do you know who I am?

843
00:59:22,830 --> 00:59:25,399
You just signed your death wish!

844
00:59:25,466 --> 00:59:27,568
Come on, we just want to talk.

845
00:59:27,635 --> 00:59:29,303
Shit.

846
00:59:29,370 --> 00:59:32,440
Didn't your mother
teach you any manners?

847
00:59:32,507 --> 00:59:35,609
Don't waste your energy.
You're tied up pretty good.

848
00:59:37,044 --> 00:59:37,878
Where am I?

849
00:59:37,945 --> 00:59:39,413
Where you are doesn't matter.

850
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:42,216
Where our friend Daisy is does.

851
00:59:42,283 --> 00:59:43,651
What is Daisy?

852
00:59:43,717 --> 00:59:46,454
Daisy is our friend that
your cartel kidnapped.

853
00:59:46,521 --> 00:59:47,822
And I know nothing of this.

854
00:59:47,888 --> 00:59:49,223
You see, that I believe.

855
00:59:49,290 --> 00:59:51,192
But all we wanted was
to come to Phuket,

856
00:59:51,258 --> 00:59:53,627
have a little vacay,
maybe dance a bit,

857
00:59:53,694 --> 00:59:55,262
drink a bit, fuck a bit.

858
00:59:55,329 --> 00:59:57,665
But that just isn't
happening now.

859
00:59:57,731 --> 00:59:58,899
She's right.

860
00:59:59,100 --> 01:00:00,868
We get back to our
villa on our first night

861
01:00:00,935 --> 01:00:02,537
and my shit-for-crap duffel bag

862
01:00:02,603 --> 01:00:04,105
is full of bricks of cocaine.

863
01:00:04,171 --> 01:00:07,441
Somehow your product got
mixed up with our luggage.

864
01:00:07,509 --> 01:00:08,577
And we wake up the next morning

865
01:00:08,642 --> 01:00:10,778
and our friend Daisy is gone.

866
01:00:28,429 --> 01:00:30,097
Silly bitches,
did you not think

867
01:00:30,164 --> 01:00:32,066
that they would
come looking for me?

868
01:00:32,133 --> 01:00:35,836
Oh sweetheart,
of course we did.

869
01:00:42,676 --> 01:00:44,278
We're over here!

870
01:00:44,345 --> 01:00:45,312
Come up here!

871
01:00:45,379 --> 01:00:46,647
Come and get us!

872
01:00:46,780 --> 01:00:48,115
We've kidnapped the head
of the Thai drug cartel,

873
01:00:48,182 --> 01:00:50,084
and he's being held
hostage by three...

874
01:00:50,151 --> 01:00:52,987
Silly, silly bitches!

875
01:00:53,487 --> 01:00:56,957
Oh, you're basically dab
smack in the middle of nowhere.

876
01:00:57,024 --> 01:01:01,395
No one can hear you, and no
one is ever going to find you.

877
01:01:03,063 --> 01:01:05,766
See, we needed
something more valuable

878
01:01:05,833 --> 01:01:08,068
than coke to get her back.

879
01:01:08,769 --> 01:01:10,471
We needed you.

880
01:01:21,583 --> 01:01:23,217
Oh, your boyfriend's here.

881
01:01:25,587 --> 01:01:27,021
You have a boyfriend?

882
01:01:27,421 --> 01:01:28,789
Sorry, man.

883
01:01:32,561 --> 01:01:34,361
I'm gonna go see what he wants.

884
01:01:38,365 --> 01:01:39,967
Jasper?

885
01:01:41,302 --> 01:01:42,836
What are you doing here?

886
01:01:47,141 --> 01:01:48,776
Well you left rather
quickly in the morning,

887
01:01:48,842 --> 01:01:50,377
so I thought I'd
just check up on you.

888
01:01:50,444 --> 01:01:51,946
I'm fine. I'm a big girl.

889
01:01:52,012 --> 01:01:54,114
I don't need anyone
checking in on me.

890
01:01:55,115 --> 01:01:56,685
Diamond, there's something
you should know, okay?

891
01:01:56,750 --> 01:01:58,587
Don't move an inch more.

892
01:01:58,653 --> 01:02:02,022
I will light you up, Jasper,
or whoever the fuck you are.

893
01:02:02,089 --> 01:02:03,490
Diamond, put the
gun down, okay?

894
01:02:03,558 --> 01:02:07,194
Come on. I know you're
involved in all this.

895
01:02:07,261 --> 01:02:08,862
I found Ryder's
bag in your room.

896
01:02:08,929 --> 01:02:12,032
All right, you're right.
You're absolutely right.

897
01:02:12,266 --> 01:02:13,602
I've been watching you girls,

898
01:02:13,734 --> 01:02:15,736
but I know all about
the drugs, okay.

899
01:02:15,803 --> 01:02:17,471
Raise your hands.

900
01:02:17,539 --> 01:02:19,273
I'm with the fucking DEA.

901
01:02:21,643 --> 01:02:24,044
The badge is in my back pocket.

902
01:02:25,246 --> 01:02:26,313
Show me.

903
01:02:26,380 --> 01:02:27,682
Slowly.

904
01:02:42,763 --> 01:02:43,864
What the fuck?

905
01:02:49,604 --> 01:02:52,306
They're using your
father's jet as a mule.

906
01:02:52,373 --> 01:02:53,807
They've been chartering
cocaine in and out

907
01:02:53,874 --> 01:02:55,943
of the golden
triangle for years.

908
01:02:56,010 --> 01:02:57,111
We've got the pilot in custody.

909
01:02:57,177 --> 01:02:59,280
He's been working
with the cartel.

910
01:03:00,014 --> 01:03:01,549
Is my dad involved in this?

911
01:03:01,616 --> 01:03:05,386
No, he's not. He doesn't
know anything about it.

912
01:03:05,452 --> 01:03:07,087
What happened?

913
01:03:07,756 --> 01:03:09,557
We hit some bad air.

914
01:03:10,190 --> 01:03:12,326
Got there a little
bit ahead of schedule.

915
01:03:12,393 --> 01:03:14,094
The plan was to make
another run to the US.

916
01:03:14,161 --> 01:03:15,462
Look, I don't know.

917
01:03:15,697 --> 01:03:17,532
Honestly, I don't know
how the bags got mixed up.

918
01:03:17,599 --> 01:03:20,134
But you knew about Daisy
and her being kidnapped.

919
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:21,502
I do.

920
01:03:25,906 --> 01:03:28,442
I assumed they would come back
to the villa for the bags.

921
01:03:28,510 --> 01:03:30,978
I didn't think they were
gonna snatch up Daisy.

922
01:03:31,713 --> 01:03:33,648
These are bad fucking dudes.

923
01:03:33,715 --> 01:03:36,917
I'm in too deep with them.
I can't blow my cover.

924
01:03:36,984 --> 01:03:39,119
I do have a contact at the DEA.

925
01:03:39,853 --> 01:03:41,589
He's gonna call the embassy.

926
01:03:41,656 --> 01:03:44,526
Hopefully set up a
rescue team for Daisy.

927
01:03:44,592 --> 01:03:46,327
No, no fucking way.

928
01:03:46,860 --> 01:03:47,861
What?

929
01:03:47,928 --> 01:03:49,430
We've got this covered.

930
01:03:49,496 --> 01:03:51,533
What do you got covered?

931
01:03:51,599 --> 01:03:53,535
This is the Thai drug cartel.

932
01:03:53,601 --> 01:03:57,071
Well now that you've
been honest with me,

933
01:03:57,137 --> 01:03:59,239
I should probably
come clean with you.

934
01:04:08,583 --> 01:04:10,351
What the fuck is this?

935
01:04:11,653 --> 01:04:13,287
That's the head of Thai cartel.

936
01:04:13,354 --> 01:04:14,488
Calm down.

937
01:04:15,523 --> 01:04:16,558
Calm down.

938
01:04:17,391 --> 01:04:20,160
D, this isn't a fucking movie.
You're not Wonder Woman.

939
01:04:20,227 --> 01:04:22,296
Fuck you. Because I'm
a girl, I'm Wonder Woman?

940
01:04:22,363 --> 01:04:24,465
No, I just don't
want you to get hurt.

941
01:04:27,368 --> 01:04:29,403
You actually care, don't you?

942
01:04:29,470 --> 01:04:30,971
Of course I care.

943
01:04:31,038 --> 01:04:34,074
Let's do it like this.
Just give me 24 hours.

944
01:04:34,576 --> 01:04:36,711
If we can't get Daisy
back on our own,

945
01:04:36,778 --> 01:04:38,145
do what you need to do.

946
01:04:38,278 --> 01:04:40,247
But, you know, best-case
scenario, we rescue Daisy,

947
01:04:40,314 --> 01:04:42,249
you get to keep your
cover and we all go back

948
01:04:42,316 --> 01:04:46,019
to our lives before
all this mess.

949
01:04:48,222 --> 01:04:50,525
I can't believe
I'm gonna say this.

950
01:04:51,726 --> 01:04:54,027
You've got 24 hours, okay?

951
01:04:55,229 --> 01:04:56,463
Oh wait.

952
01:04:57,231 --> 01:04:59,634
There's one thing I'm
gonna need from you.

953
01:04:59,701 --> 01:05:01,068
Yeah, what's that?

954
01:05:01,268 --> 01:05:04,204
Meet me here tomorrow
morning. I'll explain then.

955
01:05:07,007 --> 01:05:08,308
So cute.

956
01:05:09,677 --> 01:05:10,612
Anyway.

957
01:05:29,898 --> 01:05:31,465
Are you trying to scare me?

958
01:05:32,065 --> 01:05:33,635
Are you kidding me?

959
01:05:34,067 --> 01:05:36,671
Do you not think I've
been tortured before?

960
01:05:36,738 --> 01:05:39,139
Oh, ye of little faith.

961
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:41,509
Muzzle this fucker.

962
01:05:44,679 --> 01:05:47,014
Oh Ryder, what the fuck?

963
01:05:47,080 --> 01:05:48,783
You're not the
only one with toys.

964
01:05:49,918 --> 01:05:51,018
And it's pink.

965
01:05:51,084 --> 01:05:52,386
Okay.

966
01:06:01,428 --> 01:06:03,197
<i>You think there's a game?</i>

967
01:06:03,263 --> 01:06:05,299
<i>You must not value</i>
<i>your friend's life.</i>

968
01:06:05,365 --> 01:06:08,335
Well, I guess we don't.
So fucking kill her.

969
01:06:08,402 --> 01:06:10,204
<i>Don't push me, little girls.</i>

970
01:06:10,270 --> 01:06:11,873
<i>How do you know she's</i>
<i>not already dead?</i>

971
01:06:11,940 --> 01:06:14,274
Oh, because I
have what you want,

972
01:06:14,341 --> 01:06:15,710
and the only way you're
gonna get it back

973
01:06:15,777 --> 01:06:17,411
is by giving me what I want.

974
01:06:17,478 --> 01:06:20,447
<i>And you think you have</i>
<i>leverage? You don't.</i>

975
01:06:20,515 --> 01:06:22,817
<i>I don't give a fuck</i>
<i>about the coke!</i>

976
01:06:22,884 --> 01:06:26,119
But, Spyder, it's not the
coke that is our leverage.

977
01:06:26,186 --> 01:06:28,088
It's the delivery boy.

978
01:06:32,226 --> 01:06:33,962
<i>Jesus Fucking Christ.</i>

979
01:06:34,027 --> 01:06:36,497
Meet me tomorrow at the
Big Buddha Temple, same time.

980
01:06:36,564 --> 01:06:39,634
You wanna see him alive,
you do exactly as I say.

981
01:06:44,171 --> 01:06:45,172
Unmuzzle him.

982
01:06:49,343 --> 01:06:52,112
Do you think you're gonna
leave that place alive?

983
01:06:52,179 --> 01:06:53,480
Oh, who's the fool now?

984
01:06:53,548 --> 01:06:55,315
We have no intention
to ever meet there

985
01:06:55,382 --> 01:06:57,017
or anywhere tomorrow.

986
01:06:57,084 --> 01:06:58,653
Now, you're gonna
tell us where the fuck

987
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:00,354
your goons are
keeping our friend.

988
01:07:00,420 --> 01:07:01,723
Or what?

989
01:07:01,789 --> 01:07:03,190
You gonna cut off my finger?

990
01:07:03,257 --> 01:07:05,092
Mm, something like that.

991
01:07:06,393 --> 01:07:10,163
Ladies and gentlemen,
put your hands together

992
01:07:10,230 --> 01:07:13,433
and welcome to the stage,

993
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:19,741
Ezra, aka Dirty Mary!

994
01:08:22,537 --> 01:08:27,575
Listen closely. I am the
big bad motherfucking wolf.

995
01:08:27,642 --> 01:08:29,844
So you're gonna tell
me where Daisy is.

996
01:08:29,911 --> 01:08:32,112
One chance, right now.

997
01:08:32,446 --> 01:08:35,282
Or I'm gonna huff,
and I'm gonna huff

998
01:08:35,349 --> 01:08:38,418
and I'm gonna cut
your fucking dick off.

999
01:08:39,554 --> 01:08:40,588
Ah.

1000
01:08:41,956 --> 01:08:45,225
You better think carefully
about your next word.

1001
01:08:57,304 --> 01:08:59,272
There's a factory.

1002
01:09:01,075 --> 01:09:03,745
Your friend is being held

1003
01:09:04,277 --> 01:09:05,212
there.

1004
01:09:05,278 --> 01:09:06,748
What else?

1005
01:09:06,981 --> 01:09:10,551
We need location, security and
any surprises along the way.

1006
01:09:11,184 --> 01:09:13,353
Remember, if we
don't find Daisy,

1007
01:09:13,420 --> 01:09:18,593
no one is ever
going to find you.

1008
01:09:19,861 --> 01:09:21,495
Snip, snip.

1009
01:09:24,231 --> 01:09:26,266
Well, finally my bag's here.

1010
01:09:26,333 --> 01:09:29,070
At least I can get outta
these nip clips and minis.

1011
01:09:29,137 --> 01:09:30,672
No offense, guys.

1012
01:09:34,809 --> 01:09:37,444
Okay, I never, like,
literally never thought

1013
01:09:37,512 --> 01:09:40,380
I would ever utter
these words, but, Ryder,

1014
01:09:40,447 --> 01:09:43,618
you're gonna need to lend
Ezra and me something to wear.

1015
01:09:43,685 --> 01:09:45,053
No.

1016
01:09:45,119 --> 01:09:46,353
With pleasure.

1017
01:09:46,788 --> 01:09:49,557
All right, what about Koon,
what are we doing with him?

1018
01:09:49,624 --> 01:09:51,159
Well for now, he
stays locked away.

1019
01:09:51,258 --> 01:09:53,427
No one will find him until
we decide the time is right.

1020
01:09:53,493 --> 01:09:55,563
We could still
chop his dick off.

1021
01:09:55,630 --> 01:09:58,231
Okay, ladies, let's
get the fuck out of here

1022
01:09:58,298 --> 01:09:59,834
and go bring Daisy home.

1023
01:09:59,901 --> 01:10:00,968
Let me guess.

1024
01:10:01,035 --> 01:10:02,269
No, let me.

1025
01:10:02,335 --> 01:10:03,738
Toys.
Toys.

1026
01:10:55,990 --> 01:10:58,860
Okay, according to
Koon, we're not far.

1027
01:10:58,926 --> 01:11:01,129
The compound should be
just up over this ridge.

1028
01:11:01,929 --> 01:11:04,232
Okay,
let's keep it moving.

1029
01:11:08,870 --> 01:11:10,605
Diamond?

1030
01:11:19,080 --> 01:11:20,214
Diamond?

1031
01:11:54,949 --> 01:11:56,050
Jesus Christ.

1032
01:11:57,484 --> 01:11:59,086
Diamond, what have you done?

1033
01:12:04,692 --> 01:12:06,260
Multiple countries
have tried to bring you

1034
01:12:06,326 --> 01:12:08,229
and your family down for years.

1035
01:12:08,996 --> 01:12:11,632
Millions of dollars
in resources spent,

1036
01:12:13,768 --> 01:12:15,169
and it's gonna be
these three girls

1037
01:12:15,303 --> 01:12:18,539
who single-handedly
dismantle the Thai cartel mafia.

1038
01:12:21,108 --> 01:12:22,510
How do you feel about that?

1039
01:12:47,034 --> 01:12:48,970
Okay, you both
understand the plan?

1040
01:12:49,971 --> 01:12:52,206
I extract, you distract.

1041
01:12:52,273 --> 01:12:53,941
Daisy, we're coming for ya.

1042
01:12:54,008 --> 01:12:55,408
All right, let's move.

1043
01:13:35,216 --> 01:13:38,286
Okay, Ryder's in.
Take your position.

1044
01:13:38,352 --> 01:13:40,121
Make sure to be ready for us.

1045
01:13:40,187 --> 01:13:42,723
We're gonna have to fucking
hightail it out of there.

1046
01:13:42,790 --> 01:13:45,259
Diamond, I just want
you to know that I'm sorry.

1047
01:13:45,326 --> 01:13:49,462
Ezra, let's just cross this
first bridge for Daisy, okay?

1048
01:13:49,530 --> 01:13:50,965
Okay.

1049
01:14:35,475 --> 01:14:37,611
Okay, the charge is set.

1050
01:14:38,079 --> 01:14:40,480
Charge is set.

1051
01:14:40,548 --> 01:14:42,149
Charge set.

1052
01:15:46,280 --> 01:15:48,249
Finally, we meet.

1053
01:15:48,315 --> 01:15:49,450
Fuck you.

1054
01:15:49,518 --> 01:15:51,385
Spare the
impertinence, my darling.

1055
01:15:51,452 --> 01:15:53,988
Now, where's Tok Koon?

1056
01:15:54,055 --> 01:15:55,322
He's safe.

1057
01:15:55,389 --> 01:15:56,757
Safe?

1058
01:15:56,824 --> 01:15:59,126
You think you're so
beautiful, so smart.

1059
01:15:59,193 --> 01:16:01,028
You think you're a bunch
of American cowgirls,

1060
01:16:01,095 --> 01:16:03,497
you're gonna ride in
here and save the day?

1061
01:16:03,564 --> 01:16:04,899
I don't think so.

1062
01:16:04,965 --> 01:16:07,935
You know why?
Because you're nothing.

1063
01:16:08,002 --> 01:16:09,570
You're fucking nothing.

1064
01:16:12,206 --> 01:16:14,275
I would think
twice about that.

1065
01:16:20,448 --> 01:16:22,583
I got the cocksucker.

1066
01:16:32,660 --> 01:16:34,161
Daisy!
Ryder!

1067
01:16:36,597 --> 01:16:37,731
Ryder!

1068
01:17:28,249 --> 01:17:29,283
Ryder!

1069
01:17:31,018 --> 01:17:32,052
Ryder.

1070
01:17:32,253 --> 01:17:33,320
Are you okay?

1071
01:17:33,387 --> 01:17:35,022
I'm fine, I'm fine.
Are you okay?

1072
01:17:35,089 --> 01:17:35,923
I'm fine.

1073
01:17:35,990 --> 01:17:37,559
And what did I tell you?

1074
01:17:37,626 --> 01:17:39,493
I am a fucking badass.

1075
01:17:39,561 --> 01:17:40,794
Yes, you are.

1076
01:17:40,861 --> 01:17:43,532
Daisy, Daisy, I love you.

1077
01:17:43,598 --> 01:17:46,000
I fucking love you, Ryder.

1078
01:17:52,607 --> 01:17:55,442
Now let's get outta here.
Come on.

1079
01:17:59,914 --> 01:18:02,216
We're taking our
friend, and once we do,

1080
01:18:02,283 --> 01:18:04,586
Koon will be let
out of our custody.

1081
01:18:04,653 --> 01:18:06,153
Why should I believe you?

1082
01:18:06,253 --> 01:18:08,155
You will have double-crossed
the head of the cartel,

1083
01:18:08,222 --> 01:18:10,758
and you're gonna have a lot
more to be worried about

1084
01:18:10,824 --> 01:18:13,427
than just three cowgirls.

1085
01:18:13,494 --> 01:18:17,131
You may walk outta here
today, thinking you've won.

1086
01:18:17,198 --> 01:18:18,567
You haven't.

1087
01:18:19,266 --> 01:18:22,136
'Cause it's not about the ones
who are chasing behind you.

1088
01:18:22,203 --> 01:18:25,372
It's about the ones who are
already there ahead of you.

1089
01:18:25,439 --> 01:18:27,808
We're gonna find you, catch you,

1090
01:18:27,875 --> 01:18:29,710
and we're gonna kill all of you.

1091
01:18:29,777 --> 01:18:32,681
Revenge is gonna be sweet juice

1092
01:18:32,746 --> 01:18:34,448
that I lick off
your dead bodies.

1093
01:18:35,849 --> 01:18:37,218
Drink this.

1094
01:18:38,520 --> 01:18:40,254
You asshole.

1095
01:18:40,321 --> 01:18:41,455
No!

1096
01:18:45,159 --> 01:18:46,695
Oh my God.
Thank God, you're okay.

1097
01:18:46,794 --> 01:18:48,929
I'm fine. I just wanna
get the fuck outta here.

1098
01:18:48,996 --> 01:18:50,431
Please tell me you've
done your last line.

1099
01:18:50,497 --> 01:18:52,433
Good to see you too, Diamond.

1100
01:18:52,933 --> 01:18:54,868
Diamond, no!

1101
01:19:23,430 --> 01:19:24,465
Go, go, go!

1102
01:19:40,247 --> 01:19:43,784
I was fucking shot.
Oh, fuck!

1103
01:19:43,851 --> 01:19:44,885
Hey, you're gonna be fine.

1104
01:19:45,119 --> 01:19:46,053
Just keep pressure
on your wound.

1105
01:19:46,521 --> 01:19:48,155
Diamond, I'm really
sorry, I'm so sorry.

1106
01:19:48,222 --> 01:19:49,390
Screw it.

1107
01:19:49,591 --> 01:19:52,761
After this, you can fuck
anyone you want in my family.

1108
01:19:57,164 --> 01:19:59,033
Hasta la vista, bitches.

1109
01:20:15,082 --> 01:20:16,751
Did they get Ryder?

1110
01:20:16,817 --> 01:20:18,218
No, they didn't get Ryder.

1111
01:20:18,285 --> 01:20:20,689
That was motherfucking Ryder!

1112
01:20:28,663 --> 01:20:29,664
Okay, we're almost there.

1113
01:20:29,731 --> 01:20:30,998
Almost where?

1114
01:20:31,666 --> 01:20:34,234
God, we've got company.

1115
01:20:44,546 --> 01:20:47,381
Daisy, it's time for
a little payback.

1116
01:20:48,048 --> 01:20:50,317
Just release the
clip, aim and fire.

1117
01:20:51,553 --> 01:20:53,253
You got this, D.

1118
01:21:08,570 --> 01:21:10,070
Fuck yeah!

1119
01:21:13,641 --> 01:21:15,075
Oh, fuck it hurts!

1120
01:21:15,275 --> 01:21:16,644
You're gonna be fine.
I promise you're gonna be fine.

1121
01:21:16,711 --> 01:21:18,212
Just take it easy, okay.

1122
01:21:18,278 --> 01:21:19,413
I'm not gonna let
anything happen to you.

1123
01:21:19,480 --> 01:21:20,447
It's jammed!

1124
01:21:20,515 --> 01:21:22,182
Hold tight, ladies.

1125
01:21:54,448 --> 01:21:55,482
Ah.

1126
01:21:57,886 --> 01:22:00,187
You almost fucking
got away with it.

1127
01:22:00,254 --> 01:22:02,122
You almost rode off
into the sunset.

1128
01:22:02,189 --> 01:22:04,491
And what makes you
think we haven't?

1129
01:22:04,559 --> 01:22:06,260
Look around you, Cowgirl.

1130
01:22:06,326 --> 01:22:09,329
Remember?
I warned you.

1131
01:22:10,164 --> 01:22:11,999
You sure did.

1132
01:22:16,136 --> 01:22:17,806
Yeehaw, motherfucker.

1133
01:22:24,579 --> 01:22:27,047
All right, everybody,
get on the fucking ground!

1134
01:22:28,449 --> 01:22:30,951
Get down!
Move! Get down!

1135
01:22:32,186 --> 01:22:34,021
Stay down,
motherfucker!

1136
01:23:16,898 --> 01:23:18,232
Ladies, welcome aboard.

1137
01:23:18,365 --> 01:23:21,201
I'll be your pilot,
Jasper McDaniel. Hm-hm.

1138
01:23:51,331 --> 01:23:56,036
Was this like the best
girls trip ever or what?

1139
01:23:56,103 --> 01:23:58,205
Actually, yes.

1140
01:23:58,272 --> 01:23:59,507
By the way, when
did the two of you

1141
01:23:59,574 --> 01:24:01,174
start munching on each other?

1142
01:24:02,442 --> 01:24:03,778
Diamond, shut up.
They're cute.

1143
01:24:03,845 --> 01:24:05,513
I mean, they might be in love.

1144
01:24:06,113 --> 01:24:07,682
You're not wrong.

1145
01:24:08,181 --> 01:24:10,150
Seriously, for
better or worse,

1146
01:24:10,217 --> 01:24:11,653
this is the trip
I'll never forget.

1147
01:24:11,719 --> 01:24:13,555
I mean, Ezra just
took a fucking bullet,

1148
01:24:13,621 --> 01:24:15,990
repaired her broken
relationship with Diamond,

1149
01:24:16,056 --> 01:24:18,960
and Diamond for once in her
life has actually found someone

1150
01:24:19,027 --> 01:24:20,427
she likes more than herself.

1151
01:24:21,796 --> 01:24:25,132
And I, for once,
can be the real me.

1152
01:24:28,736 --> 01:24:30,872
Allow me,
just a little toast.

1153
01:24:30,939 --> 01:24:32,507
Yes.

1154
01:24:34,207 --> 01:24:35,777
There we go.

1155
01:24:37,612 --> 01:24:40,147
Ladies, to an inspiring
group of heroes.

1156
01:24:40,213 --> 01:24:42,750
Heroes? Fuck that,
we are Sheroes.

1157
01:24:43,585 --> 01:24:46,119
Sheroes!

1158
01:25:01,669 --> 01:25:03,004
I just
have one question.

1159
01:25:03,071 --> 01:25:05,039
Does anybody got some blow?
