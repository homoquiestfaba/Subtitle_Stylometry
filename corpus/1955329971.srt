1
00:00:04,037 --> 00:00:05,504
(dog barking)
(Man)
Yes!

2
00:00:05,506 --> 00:00:06,772
Ha, ha!
I swear to Bon Jovi,

3
00:00:06,774 --> 00:00:08,440
if these sad sacks
end up winning,

4
00:00:08,442 --> 00:00:09,842
I'm gonna
divorce you, Ray.

5
00:00:09,844 --> 00:00:12,111
We'll call Lev and have him
draw up the paperwork,

6
00:00:12,113 --> 00:00:15,080
'cause the Giants are 20 yards
away from the Super Bowl, baby!

7
00:00:15,082 --> 00:00:16,849
They ain't
gonna make it.

8
00:00:16,851 --> 00:00:19,385
Just like you wouldn't make it
one day without me.

9
00:00:19,387 --> 00:00:21,487
Yeah, you got me there.

10
00:00:21,489 --> 00:00:23,655
(TV announcer)
<i>Giants are set up on the...</i>

11
00:00:23,657 --> 00:00:26,291
Ahh, come on, guys.
This game better hurry up.

12
00:00:26,293 --> 00:00:28,460
We're gonna be late
to coach Tiny Tots.

13
00:00:28,462 --> 00:00:29,695
Yeah, well,
don't worry,

14
00:00:29,697 --> 00:00:32,164
my boys'll make
quick work of you.

15
00:00:33,933 --> 00:00:35,267
Huh, that's funny.
(gasping)

16
00:00:35,269 --> 00:00:36,702
Why are they your boys?

17
00:00:36,704 --> 00:00:38,637
Dude, please don't do
your show right now.

18
00:00:38,639 --> 00:00:39,905
So, you know this hairdo?

19
00:00:39,907 --> 00:00:42,641
Well, please inform him
that the Rams are my boys

20
00:00:42,643 --> 00:00:44,710
because they're
from my hometown.

21
00:00:44,712 --> 00:00:46,245
But none of the players
are from there.

22
00:00:46,247 --> 00:00:47,546
They change every year,

23
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:49,915
and your team
just switched cities.

24
00:00:49,917 --> 00:00:51,250
(chuckling)
You know, this reminds me

25
00:00:51,252 --> 00:00:52,551
of a famous
thought experiment.

26
00:00:52,553 --> 00:00:54,219
Shut up!
The game is on.

27
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:55,521
I'll pause it.

28
00:00:58,324 --> 00:01:00,125
Say this sandwich
is your team.

29
00:01:00,127 --> 00:01:01,727
(small gasp)
Over time,

30
00:01:01,729 --> 00:01:03,062
every part of it changes.

31
00:01:03,064 --> 00:01:04,830
The turkey gets
traded to Denver,

32
00:01:04,832 --> 00:01:06,799
the tomato gets suspended
for dog fighting,

33
00:01:06,801 --> 00:01:08,934
and the bread can't
close a stadium deal.

34
00:01:08,936 --> 00:01:11,804
So, a philosopher would ask,
"Is it even the same sandwich?"

35
00:01:11,806 --> 00:01:13,238
Hah.
(coughs)

36
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,740
(TV announcer)
<i>...On the L.A. 23 yard line...</i>

37
00:01:14,742 --> 00:01:16,075
Tastes the same to me,
Plato.

38
00:01:16,077 --> 00:01:18,177
My heart stopped.

39
00:01:18,179 --> 00:01:20,212
That's what's so weird
about being a sports fan.

40
00:01:20,214 --> 00:01:22,881
Everything but the name
changes year to year,

41
00:01:22,883 --> 00:01:24,983
but we still love
our team just as much.

42
00:01:24,985 --> 00:01:26,852
It's like we're really just
a fan of the logo.

43
00:01:26,854 --> 00:01:30,255
Great, 'cause my logo is
about to win the playoffs.

44
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:31,723
'Cause they're the best!

45
00:01:31,725 --> 00:01:33,759
Oh, the playoffs don't
pick which team is best.

46
00:01:33,761 --> 00:01:36,361
In fact, the playoffs are
a random and chaotic system

47
00:01:36,363 --> 00:01:37,996
that's little better
than a coin flip.

48
00:01:37,998 --> 00:01:39,832
Buckle in, here we go.

49
00:01:39,834 --> 00:01:41,066
Hi, I'm Adam Conover,

50
00:01:41,068 --> 00:01:43,335
and this is
"Adam Ruins Everything."

51
00:01:43,337 --> 00:01:47,039
¶
(whistling)

52
00:01:53,847 --> 00:01:55,781
Adam, please don't
ruin football.

53
00:01:55,783 --> 00:01:58,383
My folks take it
really seriously.

54
00:01:58,385 --> 00:02:00,886
This human Prius?
Ruin football?

55
00:02:00,888 --> 00:02:02,221
Yeah, right.

56
00:02:02,223 --> 00:02:05,324
Football is the bond that
holds this family together.

57
00:02:05,326 --> 00:02:07,426
My family's
the exact same way.

58
00:02:07,428 --> 00:02:10,262
Except about books
and with zero affection.

59
00:02:10,264 --> 00:02:12,364
But look, I'm a huge
football fan, too.

60
00:02:12,366 --> 00:02:14,299
I mean, I'm wearing
my favorite team's colors:

61
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:15,834
The New York Yankees.

62
00:02:15,836 --> 00:02:17,469
That's a baseball team.

63
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:19,204
Yes, but there was
also a football team called

64
00:02:19,206 --> 00:02:22,508
the New York Yankees that
played from 1926 through 1929.

65
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:25,477
Why do you have
to be so specific?

66
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:27,980
Great, now get
your amber waves of grain

67
00:02:27,982 --> 00:02:30,015
out of the way because
we're about to find out

68
00:02:30,017 --> 00:02:32,584
which of these teams
is better at football.

69
00:02:32,586 --> 00:02:34,253
<i>Gladly.</i>
<i>Ahh!</i>

70
00:02:34,255 --> 00:02:35,387
But as I was saying,

71
00:02:35,389 --> 00:02:36,855
the playoffs don't do
any such thing.

72
00:02:36,857 --> 00:02:38,991
In fact, they more or less
pick the winner at random.

73
00:02:38,993 --> 00:02:40,392
Okay, he's teleporting,

74
00:02:40,394 --> 00:02:41,994
I'm gonna go make
a sandwich for half an hour,

75
00:02:41,996 --> 00:02:43,362
Godspeed, family!

76
00:02:43,364 --> 00:02:44,796
<i>Historically, the team</i>
<i>with the best record</i>

77
00:02:44,798 --> 00:02:47,332
<i>wins the Super Bowl</i>
<i>less than half the time.</i>

78
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:49,935
It's actually more common
for a worse team to win.

79
00:02:49,937 --> 00:02:53,005
(chuckles)
Shut your mouth!

80
00:02:53,007 --> 00:02:55,240
My Giants were
the champs in 2011,

81
00:02:55,242 --> 00:02:56,475
they were number one!

82
00:02:56,477 --> 00:02:59,044
<i>Uh, no,</i>
<i>they were number ten.</i>

83
00:02:59,046 --> 00:03:02,614
The Giants regular season record
that year was nine and seven,

84
00:03:02,616 --> 00:03:05,651
the worst record of any team
to ever win a Super Bowl.

85
00:03:05,653 --> 00:03:07,719
But in the playoffs,
they beat the Packers,

86
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:10,422
who only lost
a single game all year.

87
00:03:10,424 --> 00:03:11,657
I hate to tell you this,

88
00:03:11,659 --> 00:03:13,058
but the Giants
weren't the better team.

89
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,993
They were definitely
the worst team,

90
00:03:14,995 --> 00:03:17,162
and they just got lucky.
Luck you!

91
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:23,068
Aah!

92
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:24,403
(Adam)
Any team can win one game.

93
00:03:24,405 --> 00:03:25,571
The problem
with the playoffs

94
00:03:25,573 --> 00:03:28,173
is they have way too small
of a sample size.

95
00:03:28,175 --> 00:03:31,176
Sample size?
What, like Halloween candy?

96
00:03:31,178 --> 00:03:33,011
No. Look, you're
from Jersey, right?

97
00:03:33,013 --> 00:03:34,746
Let me put it
in Jersey terms.

98
00:03:34,748 --> 00:03:36,682
Let's compare
Bruce Springsteen...

99
00:03:36,684 --> 00:03:38,984
¶ Baby we were born to run

100
00:03:38,986 --> 00:03:41,820
...the statistical
analysis of the playoffs.

101
00:03:41,822 --> 00:03:44,089
Oh, my God,
Bruce Springsteen!

102
00:03:44,091 --> 00:03:45,791
(chuckling)
And Billy Joel.

103
00:03:47,794 --> 00:03:51,597
I've been waiting in here
for the longest time.

104
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,333
Oh, my God,
Bruce Springsteen!

105
00:03:54,335 --> 00:03:58,437
Over his career,
Billy Joel has won six Grammys.

106
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:00,372
Bruce here has won 20.

107
00:04:00,374 --> 00:04:01,940
Yeah!

108
00:04:01,942 --> 00:04:04,343
But on February 25, 1981,

109
00:04:04,345 --> 00:04:07,546
Billy beat Bruce for
Best Rock Vocal Performance.

110
00:04:07,548 --> 00:04:09,448
If you decide
the whole contest

111
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:11,183
based on one day
in February,

112
00:04:11,185 --> 00:04:12,951
Billy wins.

113
00:04:12,953 --> 00:04:14,353
Bruce was robbed.

114
00:04:14,355 --> 00:04:16,121
His heart was
hungrier than mine.

115
00:04:16,123 --> 00:04:18,857
It's exactly the same
with the playoffs.

116
00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:20,392
Just 'cause
you win on one day,

117
00:04:20,394 --> 00:04:22,094
it doesn't make you
the better team.

118
00:04:22,096 --> 00:04:23,128
It's luck.

119
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:25,831
Okay, Mr. Spreadsheet, fine.

120
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:28,033
Maybe football does have
a small sample size.

121
00:04:28,035 --> 00:04:29,968
But what about
the World Series?

122
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:31,069
Best of seven.

123
00:04:31,071 --> 00:04:32,704
Oh, baseball's
even worse.

124
00:04:32,706 --> 00:04:34,873
It's actually
the most random major sport.

125
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:36,942
(crack of bat)
Since 1995,

126
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:38,977
the team with
the best regular season record

127
00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:40,379
has won the World Series

128
00:04:40,381 --> 00:04:42,848
just 16% of the time.

129
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:44,149
Ugh.

130
00:04:44,151 --> 00:04:45,550
I don't believe you.

131
00:04:45,552 --> 00:04:47,653
You're not a sports nerd,
you're just a regular nerd.

132
00:04:47,655 --> 00:04:50,022
Well, maybe you'll believe
the ultimate sports nerd,

133
00:04:50,024 --> 00:04:53,158
legendary Oakland A's
General Manager Billy Beane,

134
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,192
who once said, quote...

135
00:04:59,866 --> 00:05:02,701
Long story short, you might
as well skip the Super Bowl

136
00:05:02,703 --> 00:05:05,804
and award the championship
to whoever wins the coin flip.

137
00:05:07,173 --> 00:05:10,676
Ladies and gentlemen,
the NFL champion is: Heads!

138
00:05:10,678 --> 00:05:12,778
(both loud grunting)

139
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,279
But I love the playoffs.

140
00:05:14,281 --> 00:05:15,814
I get to yell at Joe Buck.

141
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:18,650
You'd be surprised at
what his name rhymes with.

142
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:21,687
And I like a little
randomness in my sports.

143
00:05:21,689 --> 00:05:25,724
The playoffs give Patty's crappy
underdog team a chance to win.

144
00:05:25,726 --> 00:05:28,860
Exactly, that's why
the playoffs are fun.

145
00:05:28,862 --> 00:05:31,663
Because that's when
the objectively worse underdogs

146
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:34,032
can beat their
athletic superiors.

147
00:05:34,034 --> 00:05:37,102
Face it, we don't like sports
because they're rational.

148
00:05:37,104 --> 00:05:38,637
We like them
because they're random

149
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,739
and make no sense--
let's watch.

150
00:05:40,741 --> 00:05:41,740
Ahh.

151
00:05:41,742 --> 00:05:43,508
No! Dad-gummit.

152
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,077
This Twitter egg's
been yapping so much,

153
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:47,112
we're gonna be late
for Tiny Tots practice.

154
00:05:47,114 --> 00:05:48,313
Last time we were late,

155
00:05:48,315 --> 00:05:49,948
the kids started
playing Minecraft.

156
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:52,217
We'll DVR it
and watch it later.

157
00:05:52,219 --> 00:05:53,785
Nobody say what happens.

158
00:05:53,787 --> 00:05:56,588
Ray, get the sports drinks,
the kids gotta stay hydrated.

159
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:57,989
Oh, no, they don't, heh.

160
00:05:57,991 --> 00:06:00,325
Dehydration is largely
an overblown marketing myth.

All right, kiddos,
let's run some drills.

168
00:06:20,748 --> 00:06:22,647
Ah, football practice,

169

it's my favorite part

Whoo! All right!

172
00:06:28,822 --> 00:06:31,556
Go... uh, Blue Skins?

173
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:33,291
The league made us
change the name.

174
00:06:33,293 --> 00:06:35,827
Used to be super racist.

175
00:06:35,829 --> 00:06:38,797
Not the color
you're thinking of.
(whistle blows)

176
00:06:38,799 --> 00:06:40,966
Oh, my God, we've been
out here for 15 minutes!

177
00:06:40,968 --> 00:06:43,201
We need to be hydrating!
Everybody drink up.

178
00:06:43,203 --> 00:06:46,505
Actually, the risk of
dehydration is way overblown.

179
00:06:46,507 --> 00:06:47,672
(chuckling)
Buh-buh-buh!

180
00:06:47,674 --> 00:06:49,408
You're gonna tell me
hydrating is bad?

181
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:51,109
Yeah, right, take a lap.

182
00:06:51,111 --> 00:06:52,978
Oh, I'd never make it
all the way around.

183
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:55,013
In America,
we've become obsessed

184
00:06:55,015 --> 00:06:56,982
with the dangers
of dehydration.

185
00:06:56,984 --> 00:06:59,317
People think that if they're
not constantly drinking water,

186
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:00,786
they risk death.

187
00:07:00,788 --> 00:07:03,155
You're dehydrated.

188
00:07:03,157 --> 00:07:04,790
And you're dehydrated.

189
00:07:04,792 --> 00:07:07,492
And, oh, my God,
you're practically a mummy.

190
00:07:07,494 --> 00:07:09,895
But that fear
is totally baseless.

191
00:07:09,897 --> 00:07:11,596
Yeah, right, bub.

192
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:13,999
Everyone knows you have to drink
eight glasses of water a day.

193
00:07:14,001 --> 00:07:16,835
Yeah, everybody knows that,
but it's not true.

194
00:07:16,837 --> 00:07:19,438
No study has ever shown
or even claimed that.

195
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,072
It's just
something people say.

196
00:07:21,074 --> 00:07:23,542
Really?

197
00:07:23,544 --> 00:07:25,310
Now you tell me.

198
00:07:25,312 --> 00:07:27,779
(sarcastic chuckle)
Water prevents cramps.

199
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:29,147
Oh, where'd
you hear that?

200
00:07:29,149 --> 00:07:30,549
From my coach.

201
00:07:30,551 --> 00:07:31,983
And I heard it
from my coach,

202
00:07:31,985 --> 00:07:34,486
and he heard it from
his coach, and so on.

203
00:07:34,488 --> 00:07:36,154
Well, you didn't
hear it from science,

204
00:07:36,156 --> 00:07:38,089
'cause science says
that ain't true.

205
00:07:38,091 --> 00:07:40,258
Well, how much water
am I supposed to drink?

206
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:42,394
Well, you can just drink
when you're thirsty.

207
00:07:42,396 --> 00:07:44,463
That's crazy,
you're a crazy person.

208
00:07:44,465 --> 00:07:45,664
Who are you?

209
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:48,033
Oh, Patty, this is
Tamara Hew-Butler.

210
00:07:48,035 --> 00:07:50,969
She's a professor of exercise
science at Oakland University.

211
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:52,771
Our bodies already possess

212
00:07:52,773 --> 00:07:55,073
an extremely sensitive
measure of dehydration.

213
00:07:55,075 --> 00:07:56,141
It's called thirst.

214
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:58,643
As long as we drink
when we feel thirsty,

215
00:07:58,645 --> 00:07:59,911
we really
won't dehydrate.

216
00:07:59,913 --> 00:08:02,681
That's how humans have done it
for millions of years,

217
00:08:02,683 --> 00:08:03,882
and it's worked out fine.

218
00:08:03,884 --> 00:08:06,218
The fact is, truly dangerous
levels of dehydration

219
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:08,720
are incredibly rare
and only occur in cases

220
00:08:08,722 --> 00:08:11,022
of extreme sickness
or isolation.

221
00:08:11,024 --> 00:08:12,791
As long as you have
free access to water

222
00:08:12,793 --> 00:08:14,526
and you drink
when you're thirsty,

223
00:08:14,528 --> 00:08:16,161
you'll be fine.

224
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:18,763
Then why do I do this
to myself?

225
00:08:18,765 --> 00:08:21,633
Hmm, maybe because beverage
companies have spend decades

226
00:08:21,635 --> 00:08:23,668
drowning us
in ads like these.

227
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,570
(announcer)
<i>Hardworking hydration,</i>
<i>keep at it.</i>

228
00:08:25,572 --> 00:08:27,005
Hydrate the hustle.

229
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:28,340
G2 from Gatorade,

230
00:08:28,342 --> 00:08:30,842
the low-calorie,
off-field hydrator.

231
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:34,112
Lucozade Sport hydrates
and fuels you better than water.

232
00:08:34,114 --> 00:08:36,615
'Cause the more water you drink,
the better you feel.

233
00:08:36,617 --> 00:08:37,916
<i>Drink more water!</i>

234
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:40,252
These companies have
consistently portrayed

235
00:08:40,254 --> 00:08:42,354
dehydration
as a serious threat

236
00:08:42,356 --> 00:08:46,191
for one, simple reason--
it gets us to drink more.

237
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:48,593
The International
Bottled Water Association

238
00:08:48,595 --> 00:08:50,662
publishes
a hydration calculator

239
00:08:50,664 --> 00:08:53,431
that can recommend you drink
two liters of water a day.

240
00:08:53,433 --> 00:08:55,500
Dasani tells you
that hydration is healthy,

241
00:08:55,502 --> 00:08:57,269
so drink up,
preferably Dasani.

242
00:08:57,271 --> 00:08:58,770
Paid spokesman
Dustin Pedroia

243
00:08:58,772 --> 00:09:00,906
says he always hydrates
with Vita Coco

244
00:09:00,908 --> 00:09:03,408
because it prevents cramps,
even though it doesn't.

245
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:04,910
And in "Runner's World"
magazine,

246
00:09:04,912 --> 00:09:07,479
Gatorade ran an ad
masquerading as an article

247
00:09:07,481 --> 00:09:09,414
titled "Hydration 101."

248
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:11,850
It included tips like
"drink early and often,"

249
00:09:11,852 --> 00:09:13,885
"don't wait
until you feel thirsty"

250
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:16,254
and "always drinks
sports drinks."

251
00:09:16,256 --> 00:09:18,023
But that's all
real science, right?

252
00:09:18,025 --> 00:09:19,691
Ah, here's where
it gets sticky.

253
00:09:19,693 --> 00:09:21,326
That ad was
sponsored by

254
00:09:21,328 --> 00:09:23,428
the Gatorade Sports
Science Institute,

255
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:26,765
which was founded
by Gatorade in 1985.

256
00:09:26,767 --> 00:09:28,466
Its scientific mission?

257
00:09:28,468 --> 00:09:30,402
To discover
exciting new reasons

258
00:09:30,404 --> 00:09:32,170
people should drink
their product.

259
00:09:32,172 --> 00:09:33,672
Our unbiased study found

260
00:09:33,674 --> 00:09:35,674
that people should
drink a lot of Gatorade.

261
00:09:35,676 --> 00:09:37,809
Terrific work,
alert the media!

262
00:09:37,811 --> 00:09:39,511
We also may have found
a cure for cancer.

263
00:09:39,513 --> 00:09:41,212
Was it Gatorade?

264
00:09:41,214 --> 00:09:42,981
Damn it!

265
00:09:42,983 --> 00:09:44,716
Get back to me
when it's Gatorade!

266
00:09:44,718 --> 00:09:47,752
Gatorade also sponsors
sports science research

267
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:49,888
at universities
across America,

268
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:51,656
and this can influence
their findings.

269
00:09:51,658 --> 00:09:53,258
<i>¶ Money, money...</i>

270
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:56,494
The American College of Sports
Medicine once recommended...

271
00:09:56,496 --> 00:09:59,598
When exercising, you should
drink as much as tolerable.

272
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,967
<i>¶ Money, money...</i>

273
00:10:01,969 --> 00:10:03,034
<i>¶ It's all about the money</i>

274
00:10:03,036 --> 00:10:04,636
Other companies
soon followed suit.

275
00:10:04,638 --> 00:10:07,839
Evian's parent company
founded Hydration for Health,

276
00:10:07,841 --> 00:10:08,873
a group that...

277
00:10:12,511 --> 00:10:14,379
Important research,
everybody!

278
00:10:14,381 --> 00:10:15,513
Drink Evian!

279
00:10:15,515 --> 00:10:17,882
Science says so.

280
00:10:17,884 --> 00:10:20,151
Oh, I gotta tell
the Tots about this.

281
00:10:20,153 --> 00:10:22,887
(Adam)
And, after decades
of bad science and marketing,

282
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:25,890
we now believe dehydration
is a dire threat.

283
00:10:25,892 --> 00:10:28,326
Gotta drink,
drink or I'll die!

284
00:10:28,328 --> 00:10:30,462
Well, it's not
like drinking

285
00:10:30,464 --> 00:10:32,330
too much liquid's
gonna kill anybody.

286
00:10:32,332 --> 00:10:35,033
Actually, that's
exactly what it can do.

287
00:10:35,035 --> 00:10:38,503
All of this scare mongering
over dehydration has created

288
00:10:38,505 --> 00:10:42,073
an entirely different problem:
overhydration.

289
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:46,578
Phooey, you drink hard,
you pee hard.

290
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:48,313
Not if you're exercising.

291
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:50,181
Exercise stops you
from peeing

292
00:10:50,183 --> 00:10:53,451
by putting your body
in water conservation mode.

293
00:10:53,453 --> 00:10:55,020
And if you overhydrate then,

294
00:10:55,022 --> 00:10:57,422
all that extra fluid
has nowhere to go.

295
00:10:58,524 --> 00:10:59,858
Holy crow!

296
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:02,727
It's called exercise
associated hyponatremia,

297
00:11:02,729 --> 00:11:04,596
and it can be deadly.

298
00:11:04,598 --> 00:11:07,432
In a study of
the 2002 Boston Marathon,

299
00:11:07,434 --> 00:11:09,801
nearly one-sixth
of the runners studied

300
00:11:09,803 --> 00:11:11,803
were found to have
hyponatremia.

301
00:11:11,805 --> 00:11:14,205
These runners drank so much
liquid during the race,

302
00:11:14,207 --> 00:11:17,509
that by the finish line,
they had actually gained weight.

303
00:11:17,511 --> 00:11:19,911
And she wins
by a belly!

304
00:11:19,913 --> 00:11:22,013
Okay, now, that's a joke,

305
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:24,616
but this is a serious
problem in sports.

306
00:11:24,618 --> 00:11:28,887
At least 12 athletes have
died from overhydration.

307
00:11:28,889 --> 00:11:31,089
No, that's terrible.

308
00:11:31,091 --> 00:11:33,792
It's true.
Overhydration is dangerous.

309
00:11:33,794 --> 00:11:35,927
Most researchers,
including myself,

310
00:11:35,929 --> 00:11:38,863
think that it's the marketing
of the beverage industry

311
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:40,965
that's responsibility
for this surge

312
00:11:40,967 --> 00:11:43,134
in fluid overload
hyponatremia.

313
00:11:43,136 --> 00:11:45,804
So, I've been putting
the kids in danger?

314
00:11:45,806 --> 00:11:47,305
No, Patty,

315
00:11:47,307 --> 00:11:50,108
death by hyponatremia
is extremely rare.

316
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:52,210
Just give the kids
free access to water.

317
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:53,845
Let 'em drink
when they're thirsty,

318
00:11:53,847 --> 00:11:56,881
and don't treat
these ads as science.

319
00:11:56,883 --> 00:12:00,251
I don't deserve
to wear this uniform.
(sobbing)

320
00:12:00,253 --> 00:12:02,620
Hey!
You made my Patty cry.

321
00:12:02,622 --> 00:12:05,623
Kids, let's practice
some tackling drills.

322
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:07,492
I've got just the dummy.

323
00:12:07,494 --> 00:12:09,094
See ya, Adam.

324
00:12:09,096 --> 00:12:10,795
Maybe now's a good time
to talk about the whole

325
00:12:10,797 --> 00:12:12,397
concussion issue.

326
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,632
I knew he was gonna
talk about concussions.

327
00:12:14,634 --> 00:12:17,669
Go, Blue Skins,
murderize that human tofu ball!

328
00:12:17,671 --> 00:12:19,237
(Adam)
Ah! No, wait!

329
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:21,539
The truth about concussions
is really interesting!

330
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:28,413
(birds chirping)
(Adam)
Aah!

331
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:29,948
(kids screaming)

332
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:31,783
Aah! No, no, no!

333
00:12:31,785 --> 00:12:34,652
No, kids, no, my skull hasn't
completely fused yet!

334
00:12:34,654 --> 00:12:36,054
Aah! Uhh!

335
00:12:36,056 --> 00:12:37,455
Oh, oh...

336
00:12:37,457 --> 00:12:39,157
I forgot,
kids can't hurt me.

337
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:41,292
I always forget
I'm an adult.

338
00:12:41,294 --> 00:12:43,595
But not everyone
is so lucky.

339
00:12:43,597 --> 00:12:45,864
Because the truth is,
brain injuries in the NFL--

340
00:12:45,866 --> 00:12:47,599
Hey, before you
get started, okay,

341
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:49,968
we know plenty
about concussions.

342
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:51,703
They talk about it
on "Sports Center."

343
00:12:51,705 --> 00:12:54,405
They made that Will Smith movie
I slept through,

344
00:12:54,407 --> 00:12:56,941
and they've instituted
all these new rules.

345
00:12:56,943 --> 00:13:00,645
The NFL is on it,
problem solved!

346
00:13:00,647 --> 00:13:03,214
Problem not solved,
because the truth is

347
00:13:03,216 --> 00:13:05,016
everything you know
about football

348
00:13:05,018 --> 00:13:07,152
and brain injuries
is wrong-- ugh!

349
00:13:07,154 --> 00:13:09,988
(sports commentator)
Ooh, that's gotta hurt!
That could be a concussion.

350
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:11,756
(commentator two)
Let's watch it again
from Sky Cam.

351
00:13:11,758 --> 00:13:13,091
(Adam)
Ahh!

352
00:13:13,093 --> 00:13:14,392
(commentator two)
And he's being taken
out of the game

353
00:13:14,394 --> 00:13:15,827
thanks to that
new rule.

354
00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:17,896
Good job, NFL,
you solved the problem,

355
00:13:17,898 --> 00:13:19,764
nothin' more
to see here.

356
00:13:19,766 --> 00:13:22,700
And no more fussin'
'bout concussin'.

357
00:13:22,702 --> 00:13:24,903
Actually,
let's keep fussin'.

358
00:13:24,905 --> 00:13:27,272
'Cause there's still
a ton of concussin'.

359
00:13:27,274 --> 00:13:29,941
¶

360
00:13:29,943 --> 00:13:32,944
Hey, see, Pats,
look, we're on TV.

361
00:13:32,946 --> 00:13:34,746
Hey, Murph!

362
00:13:34,748 --> 00:13:37,015
Oh, where is that
Stephen A. Smith?

363
00:13:37,017 --> 00:13:39,551
I've always wanted
to kick his ass.

364
00:13:39,553 --> 00:13:41,786
The NFL claims to take
concussions seriously.

365
00:13:41,788 --> 00:13:44,722
But the rate of diagnosed
concussions keeps rising,

366
00:13:44,724 --> 00:13:47,025
and those are just
the ones we know about.

367
00:13:47,027 --> 00:13:49,194
The truth is,
our national conversation

368
00:13:49,196 --> 00:13:50,862
about brain injuries
in football

369
00:13:50,864 --> 00:13:52,430
misses the point entirely,

370
00:13:52,432 --> 00:13:56,000
because concussions are
just the tip of the iceberg.

371
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:57,302
Huh, what's happening?

372
00:13:57,304 --> 00:13:59,103
Oh, I changed the prompter,
just go with it.

373
00:13:59,105 --> 00:14:01,573
The brain disorder found
in football players is called

374
00:14:01,575 --> 00:14:04,375
Chronic Traumatic
Encephalopathy or CTE,

375
00:14:04,377 --> 00:14:05,910
and here's the hard truth.

376
00:14:05,912 --> 00:14:09,113
It's not just caused
by concussion-- wait, really?

377
00:14:09,115 --> 00:14:10,315
Yes, really.

378
00:14:10,317 --> 00:14:12,984
It's also caused
by the tiny run-of-the-mill hits

379
00:14:12,986 --> 00:14:15,186
that happen dozens
of times a game.

380
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:17,422
Plays like this one.

381
00:14:17,424 --> 00:14:19,724
Ooh, that was unremarkable.

382
00:14:19,726 --> 00:14:21,626
This one...

383
00:14:21,628 --> 00:14:24,028
Booyah!
Those are common.

384
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:26,297
Or even this one...

385
00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:30,401
Howzah! I'm snorin'
because that was boring.

386
00:14:30,403 --> 00:14:34,072
Exactly, these are totally
routine tackles and plays

387
00:14:34,074 --> 00:14:36,107
that happen
over and over again

388
00:14:36,109 --> 00:14:38,977
in every game,
especially to linemen.

389
00:14:38,979 --> 00:14:42,347
But research now shows that
even little hits like these

390
00:14:42,349 --> 00:14:45,617
cause CTE, which can lead
to lifelong memory loss,

391
00:14:45,619 --> 00:14:46,885
depression, aggression,

392
00:14:46,887 --> 00:14:50,121
dementia, anxiety,
and even suicide.

393
00:14:50,123 --> 00:14:51,556
Hold up, hot shot.

394
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:55,093
How do tiny little baby hits
like that cause dementia?

395
00:14:55,095 --> 00:14:57,295
Good question-- let's go
to the premier expert

396
00:14:57,297 --> 00:14:59,097
in this field,
Dr. Ann McKee,

397
00:14:59,099 --> 00:15:01,065
Professor of Neurology
at Boston University

398
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:03,234
and Director
of the CTE Center.

399
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:04,435
Thanks for
joining us, Ann.

400
00:15:04,437 --> 00:15:05,770
<i>Thanks, Adam.</i>

401
00:15:05,772 --> 00:15:07,205
Unfortunately, it's true.

402
00:15:07,207 --> 00:15:09,173
CTE isn't just caused
by concussions.

403
00:15:09,175 --> 00:15:11,709
It's also caused by the small
sub-concussive hits

404
00:15:11,711 --> 00:15:13,111
that build up over time.

405
00:15:13,113 --> 00:15:15,113
If you play football
at any level,

406
00:15:15,115 --> 00:15:18,283
the chronic hits to the head
will cause brain damage.

407
00:15:18,285 --> 00:15:20,685
Well, that's easy,
why don't they just
build better helmets?

408
00:15:20,687 --> 00:15:22,487
That will never work.

409
00:15:22,489 --> 00:15:24,155
When the body
and head suddenly stop,

410
00:15:24,157 --> 00:15:26,624
the brain stretches, breaking
its internal structures.

411
00:15:26,626 --> 00:15:29,027
Unless you can fit
a helmet inside your skull,

412
00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:30,695
there is no way to stop it.

413
00:15:30,697 --> 00:15:33,531
Yeah, but that can't happen
to, like, everyone, right?

414
00:15:33,533 --> 00:15:35,400
(Ann)
Unfortunately, it does, Ray.

415
00:15:35,402 --> 00:15:37,535
We found CTE in over 96%

416
00:15:37,537 --> 00:15:40,405
of former professional players'
brains that we've studied.

417
00:15:40,407 --> 00:15:42,106
96%?
Oh, no.

418
00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:45,910
Ooh, that is
regretful and upsetful.

419
00:15:45,912 --> 00:15:47,712
The fact is,
our research shows

420
00:15:47,714 --> 00:15:50,381
that it's practically
impossible to play football

421
00:15:50,383 --> 00:15:52,884
without suffering
irreversible brain damage.

422
00:15:52,886 --> 00:15:54,819
And the NFL
knows about this?

423
00:15:54,821 --> 00:15:57,422
They do, in fact
the NFL has admitted

424
00:15:57,424 --> 00:16:00,258
that playing football
is linked to CTE.

425
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:02,293
They just don't
take it seriously.

426
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:04,062
When asked whether
football was dangerous,

427
00:16:04,064 --> 00:16:06,130
NFL Commissioner
Roger Goodell said...

428
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:07,265
There's risk in life.

429
00:16:07,267 --> 00:16:08,933
There's risk to sitting
on the couch.

430
00:16:08,935 --> 00:16:11,069
I don't know about you,
but if my couch was

431
00:16:11,071 --> 00:16:13,972
giving brain damage to 96%
of the people that sat on it,

432
00:16:13,974 --> 00:16:15,673
I would throw out
that couch.

433
00:16:15,675 --> 00:16:17,308
But, hey,
I guess it's easy

434
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:18,977
to ignore the truth
when you're getting paid

435
00:16:18,979 --> 00:16:21,879
34 million bucks a year
to protect the status quo.

436
00:16:21,881 --> 00:16:24,048
Well, the players
are millionaires, too.

437
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:26,584
I'd take that risk
for that kind of cash.

438
00:16:26,586 --> 00:16:28,653
Oh, yeah, NFL players can
make their own decisions.

439
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:29,754
They're adults.

440
00:16:29,756 --> 00:16:32,590
But you know who can't?
Kids.

441
00:16:32,592 --> 00:16:34,625
Oh, crap, children.

442
00:16:34,627 --> 00:16:36,294
I forgot about
the children.

443
00:16:36,296 --> 00:16:38,896
There are less than
2,000 current NFL players,

444
00:16:38,898 --> 00:16:42,066
but more than 1 million high
school students play the game,

445
00:16:42,068 --> 00:16:45,536
as well as hundreds of thousands
of straight-up kids.

446
00:16:45,538 --> 00:16:48,172
And, well, I'll let
Dr. McKee tell you the rest.

447
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:51,576
Children's brains are especially
susceptible to brain damage.

448
00:16:51,578 --> 00:16:54,412
The truth is the brain
isn't even finished developing

449
00:16:54,414 --> 00:16:56,280
until age 25.

450
00:16:56,282 --> 00:16:57,915
It's difficult
to say this,

451
00:16:57,917 --> 00:17:01,386
but children simply should not
be allowed to play football.

452
00:17:01,388 --> 00:17:03,154
Isn't that
a little overboard?

453
00:17:03,156 --> 00:17:04,689
Well, why don't you
ask the players?

454
00:17:04,691 --> 00:17:07,291
If I had a ten-year-old boy,
I don't know that I'd be

455
00:17:07,293 --> 00:17:10,061
real inclined to encourage him
to go play football.

456
00:17:10,063 --> 00:17:12,797
If you had
an eight-year-old kid now...

457
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:15,099
would you tell him you'd
want him to play football?

458
00:17:15,101 --> 00:17:16,434
I wouldn't.

459
00:17:16,436 --> 00:17:18,136
And my whole life was football.

460
00:17:18,138 --> 00:17:21,039
Especially me, knowing
what I know now, there--

461
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:22,940
there's absolutely no way,

462
00:17:22,942 --> 00:17:25,576
no way in hell that I would
do it all over again.

463
00:17:25,578 --> 00:17:28,112
Harry Carson?

464
00:17:28,114 --> 00:17:31,015
But he won the Super Bowl
with the Giants in '86.

465
00:17:31,017 --> 00:17:33,084
He would
take that all back?

466
00:17:33,086 --> 00:17:35,753
Look, it's hard to hear
that the game we love

467
00:17:35,755 --> 00:17:38,589
is killing people
and hurting kids.

468
00:17:38,591 --> 00:17:39,891
But it's true.

469
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,860
Oh, my God, the kids,
the Blue Skins.

470
00:17:42,862 --> 00:17:44,362
I had them run
tackling drills.

471
00:17:44,364 --> 00:17:46,397
Adam, get us out of here!
We gotta stop them!

472
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:47,365
Right.

473
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:51,035
No, no, no!

474
00:17:51,037 --> 00:17:52,970
(sound slowed)
Noooo!

475
00:17:52,972 --> 00:17:56,741
We'll be
right baaaack!

476
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,917
No! No, no, no.
No, no, no!

477
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,819
Ah, whoof.

478
00:18:07,821 --> 00:18:09,754
Thank God
they're so bad at football.

479
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:12,657
All right, everybody stop.
Take a knee, Blue Skins.

480
00:18:12,659 --> 00:18:14,092
(Patty)
Come on.

481
00:18:14,094 --> 00:18:15,893
I can't believe
I'm saying this,

482
00:18:15,895 --> 00:18:18,196
but we all gotta stop
playing football.

483
00:18:18,198 --> 00:18:20,765
It's dangerous,
and there's no way to stop it.

484
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:23,267
Ray,
there's another way.

485
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:26,170
It's true, if we keep playing
football the same old way,

486
00:18:26,172 --> 00:18:27,638
players will keep dying,

487
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,407
parents will pull
the next generation

488
00:18:29,409 --> 00:18:30,975
of athletes
out of the sport,

489
00:18:30,977 --> 00:18:33,811
and the game we love will
slowly fade from prominence

490
00:18:33,813 --> 00:18:36,147
just like boxing
and horse racing did.

491
00:18:36,149 --> 00:18:38,049
We used to feel
five feet tall.

492
00:18:38,051 --> 00:18:41,185
But now
we're minced meat.
(bell dings)

493
00:18:41,187 --> 00:18:43,121
Tastes do change.

494
00:18:43,123 --> 00:18:44,388
But they don't have to.

495
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:47,191
We can save football
by changing it.

496
00:18:47,193 --> 00:18:51,162
Like how? You just said almost
all hits cause brain damage.

497
00:18:51,164 --> 00:18:53,698
So, what, we ban tackling
and get rid of linemen?

498
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,166
I mean, yes,
that would work.

499
00:18:55,168 --> 00:18:56,601
But that wouldn't
be football.

500
00:18:56,603 --> 00:18:59,837
Yeah, that's exactly what
they said back in 1905.

501
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:01,339
(Adam)
Back then, the sport
was so violent

502
00:19:01,341 --> 00:19:04,008
that college players were
getting trampled to death.

503
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:07,145
There were 18 deaths
nationwide that year alone.

504
00:19:07,147 --> 00:19:09,147
Yes, the sports
was far too brutal

505
00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:11,149
even for me,
Teddy Roosevelt!

506
00:19:11,151 --> 00:19:13,351
(birds screeches)
Ooh!

507
00:19:13,353 --> 00:19:15,720
That's why I insisted
football legalize

508
00:19:15,722 --> 00:19:17,054
a forward pass.

509
00:19:17,056 --> 00:19:20,024
It made the game safer
by opening up the field.

510
00:19:20,026 --> 00:19:22,827
Yes, that made the game
fundamentally different forever,

511
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:25,396
but it was still football.

512
00:19:25,398 --> 00:19:28,499
(bird squawks, thud)
Ooh!

513
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:29,667
Ha ha!

514
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:31,202
I don't know,
that seems hard.

515
00:19:31,204 --> 00:19:32,436
Well, we have a choice.

516
00:19:32,438 --> 00:19:33,738
We could either
do the hard thing

517
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,373
and make real changes
to the game,

518
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:37,008
or we can keep
ignoring the problem,

519
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:40,077
and 50 years from now
football will be dead.

520
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:42,346
And that would be a shame
because football is awesome.

521
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:43,814
(all)
Yeah!

522
00:19:43,816 --> 00:19:45,650
Ah, here you guys are.
Oh...

523
00:19:45,652 --> 00:19:47,385
Remember when
you said that everything

524
00:19:47,387 --> 00:19:50,087
about this sandwich could change
and you would still love it?

525
00:19:50,089 --> 00:19:53,024
Well, then why is the one part
that's killing people

526
00:19:53,026 --> 00:19:56,093
the part that we decided
we have no power over?

527
00:19:56,095 --> 00:19:59,363
Let's save the sport we love
by changing it for the better.

528
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:00,431
Are you with me?

529
00:20:00,433 --> 00:20:01,499
(all)
Yeah!

530
00:20:01,501 --> 00:20:02,600
I said,
are you with me?!

531
00:20:02,602 --> 00:20:03,601
(all)
Yeah!

532
00:20:03,603 --> 00:20:04,902
Well, then let's
get out there

533
00:20:04,904 --> 00:20:07,538
and never play
tackle football ever again!

534
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,673
(all cheering)

535
00:20:08,675 --> 00:20:10,408
Let's go,
let's play touch.

536
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:12,710

537
00:20:21,453 --> 00:20:23,221
(engine revving)

538
00:20:23,223 --> 00:20:24,922
Hey, is Adam here?

539
00:20:24,924 --> 00:20:27,091
Yeah, and you are?

540
00:20:27,093 --> 00:20:28,426
I'm his sister.

541
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:32,263
His sister?

542
00:20:32,265 --> 00:20:33,864
Oh. Rhea, hi!

543
00:20:33,866 --> 00:20:36,033
Hey, slugger,
how was your show thing?

544
00:20:36,035 --> 00:20:37,768
Oh, it was great,
I taught Murph's parents

545
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:39,136
all about
playoff statistics

546
00:20:39,138 --> 00:20:41,138
and hydration
and how playing football

547
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,406
injures the brains
of millions

548
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:44,141
of high school students
every year.

549
00:20:44,143 --> 00:20:45,810
Well, I'm glad
you had fun.

550
00:20:45,812 --> 00:20:47,778
Hey, I hope he didn't
bug you too much.

551
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:48,779
Did you, uh...

552
00:20:48,781 --> 00:20:50,581
did you restore
this car yourself?

553
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:53,084
Oh, yeah, 500 bucks and
five years of elbow grease.

554
00:20:53,086 --> 00:20:54,619
She's a beauty, huh?
Yeah.

555
00:20:54,621 --> 00:20:56,687
Well, aesthetics aside,
public transportation

556
00:20:56,689 --> 00:20:58,055
would be far more efficient...
(engine revving)

557
00:20:58,057 --> 00:20:59,257
What? What's that?

558
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:00,825
I can't hear you
over this horsepower!

559
00:21:00,827 --> 00:21:01,959
Say goodbye, Adam.

560
00:21:01,961 --> 00:21:04,462
Bye, Murph, see you
on Crossword Puzzle Friday!

561
00:21:04,464 --> 00:21:07,965
(tires screeching,
engine revving)

562
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:09,734
Maybe he's adopted?
