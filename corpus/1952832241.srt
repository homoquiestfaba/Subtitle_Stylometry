1
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:45,350
PART ONE

2
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:04,930
Well, don't think there's much
else I can do around here.

3
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:08,060
Might take a little
walk down the street.

4
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:15,940
You going to be home for supper?

5
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:17,990
Sure.

6
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:31,460
I want to know.

7
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:34,650
Told you if I'm not home by 6:00...

8
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:37,030
Well that doesn't do me any good.

9
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:39,940
Mrs. Whitley's paying
three dollars for this cake

10
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:44,070
and if you're going to be home I'll spend part
of that money on lamb chops for your supper.

11
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:48,270
If not, I'll buy something
the girls will like better.

12
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,900
Then count me out.

13
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,390
That's all I wanted to know.

14
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:00,360
I fixed up those trees.

15
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:05,080
Cut the grass.
Looks pretty nice out there.

16
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,660
You going to water the grass?

17
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:11,310
I did water it.

18
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:13,860
Gave it a good wetting down.

19
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:19,139
Most people, when they water the grass,
wait till later, when the sun's not so hot,

20
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:21,679
and it'll do some good,

21
00:05:21,679 --> 00:05:25,290
and not be a waste of good water
that somebody else has to pay for.

22
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:27,749
You see any work I
can do that I don't do?

23
00:05:27,749 --> 00:05:29,170
So you get done early.

24
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:32,120
Come on, Mildred,
what are you getting at?

25
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:39,359
She's waiting for you, so go on.

26
00:05:39,359 --> 00:05:41,840
Who's waiting for me?

27
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,350
I think you know.

28
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,599
If you're talking
about Maggie Biederhof,

29
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:51,610
I haven't seen her for a week,

30
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:52,880
and she never did mean a thing to me

31
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,220
except somebody to play rummy
with when I had nothing else to do.

32
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:58,819
Which is practically all the time,
if you ask me.

33
00:05:58,819 --> 00:06:02,420
- I wasn't asking you!
- So what do you do with her?

34
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:05,950
Play rummy for a while, then unbutton
that red dress she's always wearing

35
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:08,410
without any brassiere under it,
and then flop her on the bed?

36
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:11,410
And then play rummy some more and
then flop her on the bed again?

37
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:14,249
Gee, that must be swell.
I can't think of anything nicer than that!

38
00:06:14,249 --> 00:06:16,610
How'd you like to go to hell!

39
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:19,659
Ever since you met that woman...
Useless, do you hear me?

40
00:06:19,659 --> 00:06:21,169
Oh for cryin' out loud...

41
00:06:21,169 --> 00:06:22,790
Then tell... Then tell me I'm wrong.

42
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:24,829
Tell me that's not
precisely where you're going!

43
00:06:24,829 --> 00:06:25,789
Suppose I am?

44
00:06:25,789 --> 00:06:27,880
Then you might as well go pack
your bags and leave for good,

45
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:31,630
because if you go out that door,
I swear to God, Bert,

46
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:33,080
I'm not letting you back inside.

47
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,559
Keep on, Mildred. Keep right on.

48
00:06:34,559 --> 00:06:37,109
'Cause one of these days,
you don't watch out, I'm calling you!

49
00:06:37,109 --> 00:06:40,069
You're not calling me. I'm calling you!

50
00:06:40,069 --> 00:06:43,539
You go over there today Bert, and that's the
last you see of this place, so help me God.

51
00:06:43,539 --> 00:06:45,450
I go where I goddamn please!

52
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:49,510
- Then pack up!
- Fine! If that's what you want, okay!

53
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,040
Mildred!

54
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:36,170
Oh hey, honey.

55
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:40,810
- He took the car.
- Who, you mean Bert?

56
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:44,570
Yes, Bert. He's gone.

57
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:46,160
What do you mean?

58
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,230
Just now. He just left.

59
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:53,910
He just walked out on you?
Just like that?

60
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:57,130
- Maybe he got a little help.
- What?

61
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:02,429
For that floppy-looking frump?
What did he say?

62
00:08:02,429 --> 00:08:07,229
- How can he even look at that woman?
- Oh, what's the use of talking?

63
00:08:07,229 --> 00:08:10,700
If she likes him,
all right then, she's got him.

64
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,889
That wasn't even the reason.

65
00:08:12,889 --> 00:08:17,430
And I did pester him,
but I just can't take things lying down.

66
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:19,000
I don't care how bad things are.

67
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,500
If she can, then fine,
because that's just the way he's built.

68
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:29,020
I've got my own ideas and I just
can't change them for somebody else.

69
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,840
So what are you gonna do?

70
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:37,930
You just joined the
biggest army on Earth.

71
00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:42,319
You're the great American institution that
never gets mentioned on the Fourth of July...

72
00:08:42,319 --> 00:08:43,869
A "grass widow,"

73
00:08:43,869 --> 00:08:47,300
with two small children to raise
on your own. That dirty bastard.

74
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:50,049
Oh, Bert's all right.

75
00:08:50,049 --> 00:08:54,610
He's all right, but he's a dirty bastard.
They're all dirty bastards.

76
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:56,179
We're not so perfect.

77
00:08:56,179 --> 00:08:59,430
Yeah, well, we wouldn't
pull what they pull.

78
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:02,160
Not right now.

79
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,590
I almost forgot, I fricasseed
some chicken for supper,

80
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:07,630
but Ike's got a call in Long Beach,
so I'm going with him.

81
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:10,270
- I thought it might spoil.
- Thank you.

82
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:13,420
Mildred, I don't know how you do it.

83
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:18,200
- What?
- That cake. It's beautiful!

84
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:22,930
- Hello, dear.
- Hello, Mother.

85
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,510
How was practice?

86
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:30,000
<i>Hmm, pas extraordinaire.</i>

87
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:35,870
That is, if Chopin's Grand Valse
Brilliante doesn't give me palsy.

88
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:39,870
- Where's your sister?
- Outside.

89
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:45,010
- Now what did I say?
- Mommy!

90
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:51,460
- Oh. Uh, the, the Grand Valse...
- Valse Brilliante.

91
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:53,320
Really, Mother.

92
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:57,919
And who, pray tell, is "Bob"?

93
00:09:57,919 --> 00:10:02,329
- Here. I had extra batter.
- Oh, Mother, it's darling!

94
00:10:02,329 --> 00:10:05,089
- Bob Whitley.
- Oh, of course. The paper boy.

95
00:10:05,089 --> 00:10:06,790
Ray! Time to come in!

96
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:08,620
Mommy, guess what?

97
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:13,500
He'll be a paper boy without a birthday cake
if I don't find some way to get it over there.

98
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:18,050
Maybe your grandfather
wouldn't mind taking me.

99
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:21,310
Why can't we use our car?

100
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,890
Your father's out with it, and he...
He may be late.

101
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:27,939
<i>What time is it? Richard Crooks
is back on the Voice of Firestone.</i>

102
00:10:27,939 --> 00:10:29,740
<i>- He's doing a medley of the The Student Prince.
- Mommy!</i>

103
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:31,639
You still have time.

104
00:10:31,639 --> 00:10:34,179
Mommy, guess what?
Mommy, look!

105
00:10:34,179 --> 00:10:36,199
I fixed my skates all by myself,

106
00:10:36,199 --> 00:10:38,520
and I added string, and now
they're not too small anymore!

107
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:43,039
Ray, dear, please be
careful around the cake.

108
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:46,850
- Ray!
- I'm just pretending.

109
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:49,380
Look Mommy, guess who I am!

110
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:53,699
♪ Swaa-neee! How I love ya,
my dear old Swanee... ♪

111
00:10:53,699 --> 00:10:54,800

116
00:11:06,919 --> 00:11:12,600
In class, Miss Pinkins said my
caterpillar was the most beautiful.

117
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:16,350
Mother, where's Father?

118
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,790
He had to go somewhere.

119
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:27,350
- Now please, dear, come sit down and...
- Then where are his clothes?

120
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:38,650
He's gone away.

121
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:42,010
Where to?

122
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:47,500
I don't know.

123
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,870
Is he coming back?

124
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:52,540
No. No.

125
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:57,559
But why? Why has he gone away?

126
00:11:57,559 --> 00:12:01,220
I can't explain it all this instant.

127
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,920
Someday you girls will understand.

128
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,419
What's important to know is
there's nothing to worry about.

129
00:12:07,419 --> 00:12:08,319
But, Daddy's gone?

130
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:18,239
Oh, it's all right, dear. Hey.

131
00:12:18,239 --> 00:12:21,710
I just wanted to know
why his clothes were gone.

132
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:25,010
Oh, darling, don't worry.

133
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:27,870
You know... You know your father
thinks the world of you girls.

134
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:30,949
But he... He didn't want to
say goodbye because he...

135
00:12:30,949 --> 00:12:33,800
He didn't want to
upset you or worry you.

136
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,310
But it's not his fault.
It's no one's fault.

137
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:42,390
It's simply due to things that...
That happen.

138
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:44,780
All right?

139
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:48,330
If you mean Mrs. Biederhof, Mother,

140
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:53,740
I quite agree. I think she's
distinctly middle class.

141
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:59,540
Oh, Veda.

142
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:03,800
My darling.

143
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,029
What would I do without you girls?
Hmm?

144
00:13:06,029 --> 00:13:10,120
My beautiful, lovely, lovely girls.

145
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:14,180
Aw, cut the mush!

146
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,020
Great American institution.

147
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:15,610
Given your age, I'm afraid it's going
to be rather difficult to place you.

148
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:17,889
I worked a counter, I can stock goods,

149
00:14:17,889 --> 00:14:19,249
- Whatever they need, ma'am.
- I'm terribly sorry,

150
00:14:19,249 --> 00:14:21,209
- I can do it!
- But I have a room full of people to get to.

151
00:14:21,209 --> 00:14:23,730
If you'll excuse me.

152
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:26,880
Never mind about all them
years behind a register.

153
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,859
Doesn't mean a damn thing!

154
00:14:28,859 --> 00:14:31,460
Why, I've been working
since I was six years old.

155
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:34,529
Six years old!
At the Abba-Zabba factory!

156
00:14:34,529 --> 00:14:37,930
- If that don't account for any darn skill..
- Mrs. Pierce?

157
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:41,029
Receptionist, eh?

158
00:14:41,029 --> 00:14:42,829
Sorry, dearie.

159
00:14:42,829 --> 00:14:46,390
Just so happens, at the moment,
receptionists are out.

160
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:49,700
- Out?
- That was then.

161
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:52,539
In those good old days,
when even a hockshop had to stick

162
00:14:52,539 --> 00:14:56,919
this receptionist thing out there
in front to show it had class.

163
00:14:56,919 --> 00:14:59,049
Well...

164
00:14:59,049 --> 00:15:01,739
certainly there are
other things I can do.

165
00:15:01,739 --> 00:15:03,339
I'm an excellent cook.

166
00:15:03,339 --> 00:15:06,349
I sell my own pies and cakes,

167
00:15:06,349 --> 00:15:10,999
I wrote down receptionist,
but that's not all I can do.

168
00:15:10,999 --> 00:15:12,259
Sure it is.

169
00:15:12,259 --> 00:15:15,050
Or you would have
written it on the card.

170
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:17,260
I go by the cards.

171
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:24,429
Stenographers, secretaries,
laboratory assistants, nurses, chemists.

172
00:15:24,429 --> 00:15:27,749
I mean, some of these
girls have PhDs. ScDs.

173
00:15:27,749 --> 00:15:31,579
Bookkeepers, salespeople.

174
00:15:31,579 --> 00:15:32,820
All laid off.

175
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:36,049
Sitting by their phones,
hoping and praying I'll call.

176
00:15:36,049 --> 00:15:38,119
I won't call.

177
00:15:38,119 --> 00:15:43,050
What I'm trying to tell you is
you haven't got a chance.

178
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:47,440
Okay, let me get that wrapped up for you.

179
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:54,590
Here you go. All right.

180
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:57,370
Anything else I can get for you?

181
00:15:57,370 --> 00:16:01,820
Would you like that on the blue side,
or... Very good.

182
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,750
Next, please.

183
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,900
Oh hi, ma'am, what can I get for you?

184
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:29,290
All right, off to the beach.

185
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:31,429
I want to get you that inner tube, too.

186
00:16:31,429 --> 00:16:33,040
There's Mother!

187
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:37,400
Mommy, Mommy, can we go over to Grandpa and
Grandma's house for dinner and sleepover?

188
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,430
Can we, Mommy? Please?

189
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:43,120
We thought it'd be nice for the girls,
what with everything you've got on your plate.

190
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,110
I just bought groceries.

191
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:46,870
Please, Mommy, say yes.

192
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:49,120
Veda already packed up
a case for the weekend.

193
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,349
- Well, of course you can, dear.
- There.

194
00:16:51,349 --> 00:16:52,390
- Thank you mommy, thank you!
- Don't worry, Mother.

195
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:54,520
I brought her slippers
and her little bear.

196
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:57,730
So long as you girls
are sure to help out.

197
00:16:57,730 --> 00:16:58,879
And look after your sister.

198
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:01,320
- All aboard!
- Naturally, Mother.

199
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,450
You sure Bert didn't put you up to this?

200
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:06,970
- Bert?
- The girls were all alone.

201
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:12,119
Well, have a wonderful time, you two.
And mind your grandparents!

202
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:14,870
- We will. Bye.
- Bye, Mother.

203
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:18,690
- Bye, darlings.
- I can't wait to go swimming!

204
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,200
Bye!

205
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:30,470
Simmer down.

206
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:19,320
Well, that was fast.

207
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,220
Hello, Mildred. Is Bert around?

208
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:25,020
Wally. Uh...

209
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,419
No. Not right now he isn't.

210
00:18:27,419 --> 00:18:31,520
- Do you know where he went?
- I don't.

211
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,920
All right. Well, um...

212
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:37,970
We had a little trouble over
at Pierce Homes over a title.

213
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:41,050
Thought maybe he could help out.

214
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:45,430
Ask him to drop over, will you?

215
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:47,419
Is it... Would there be a fee?

216
00:18:47,419 --> 00:18:50,540
We could probably cook up something.

217
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:57,830
Wally, come in, will you?

218
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:06,980
If it's important, Wally, it might
be better you look Bert up yourself.

219
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:11,410
He's... He's not living here anymore.

220
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:14,409
- What?
- He went away.

221
00:19:14,409 --> 00:19:15,830
Where?

222
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:17,730
I don't know. I didn't ask.

223
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:21,820
But I'm sure old Mr. Pierce might know,
or perhaps Maggie Biederhof.

224
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:23,860
At least how to reach him.

225
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,110
Well.

226
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:30,110
When did all this happen?

227
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:34,310
Just a few days ago.

228
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:38,540
So you're saying you're
busted up for good?

229
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:44,010
Well, yes, as far as I know.

230
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,820
Well, that's a hell of a note.

231
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:07,510
So what have you been
doing with yourself?

232
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:10,400
Oh, I keep myself busy.

233
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:13,080
You don't look busy.

234
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:18,790
The girls are away with their
grandparents and I have the day off.

235
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:24,780
You know, I wouldn't ask too
much to take it off with you.

236
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:27,570
Never did mind being around you, Mildred.

237
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:33,619
Well... You certainly
kept it to yourself.

238
00:20:33,619 --> 00:20:36,930
Me, I'm conscientious.

239
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:47,270
But say, what are you
doing tomorrow night?

240
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:52,270
Well?

241
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:57,930
- Wally Burgan?
- Yes, Wally Burgan.

242
00:20:57,930 --> 00:21:00,530
Since when was Wally
Burgan interested in you?

243
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:02,129
I don't think he ever was.

244
00:21:02,129 --> 00:21:05,309
But the second he heard Bert was gone,

245
00:21:05,309 --> 00:21:09,289
well it was almost funny
the effect it had on him.

246
00:21:09,289 --> 00:21:11,590
Yeah, I forgot to mention that.

247
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:14,959
The morals they give you credit for,
you'd be surprised.

248
00:21:14,959 --> 00:21:19,709
To him, you were a red-hot mama
the second he found out.

249
00:21:19,709 --> 00:21:22,560
- Found out what?
- Grass widow!

250
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,860
From now on, honey, you're fast.

251
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:30,390
- Are you serious?
- I am. And they are.

252
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,899
So how'd you leave it for tomorrow?

253
00:21:32,899 --> 00:21:36,630
Well, he's picking me up at seven,

254
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:39,480
and taking me out somewhere.

255
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,790
All right. See,
there's mistake number one.

256
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:45,050
First thing, I wouldn't let
that cluck buy your dinner.

257
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:49,340
No, I would sit him right down and give
him one of those Mildred Pierce specials,

258
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,089
- just like...
- What?

259
00:21:50,089 --> 00:21:52,069
Me work when he's
willing to take me out?

260
00:21:52,069 --> 00:21:55,719
As an investment, baby!
Now shut up and let me talk.

261
00:21:55,719 --> 00:21:59,009
Why do you suppose he wants
to take you out someplace?

262
00:21:59,009 --> 00:22:00,310
To show respect?

263
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:02,830
To prove his high regard for you?
Malarkey!

264
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:06,920
They take us out for one reason,
and one reason only. To get a drink.

265
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,229
Them.

266
00:22:08,229 --> 00:22:12,160
And, baby,
right there is where I come in.

267
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,500
- Come with me.
- What? Now?

268
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:18,640
Now this stuff, the gin and the scotch,
is right off the boat,

269
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:22,920
but it's legit, wherever Ike got it from.
And it's A-1.

270
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:25,750
Now the other stuff, the wine,
is from right here in California,

271
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:28,020
but it's okay booze, so lean on it.

272
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:29,520
That's the trick, baby.

273
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:34,109
You handle the wine right and the
high-priced stuff will last and last.

274
00:22:34,109 --> 00:22:39,080
- Now, what are you serving?
- Who says I'm serving anything?

275
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:42,139
Baby, baby. You go out with him,

276
00:22:42,139 --> 00:22:44,869
and he buys you dinner,
and you get a little tight,

277
00:22:44,869 --> 00:22:47,150
and you come home and
something happens...

278
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:49,250
Don't worry. Nothing'll happen.

279
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:52,310
Of course something'll happen,
eventually.

280
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:54,790
And when it happens, it's sin.

281
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:57,300
It's sin because you're
a grass widow and fast

282
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:59,889
and he's all paid up
because he bought you dinner.

283
00:22:59,889 --> 00:23:01,709
That makes it square.

284
00:23:01,709 --> 00:23:06,639
But if you bought his dinner,
and cooked it for him the way you do,

285
00:23:06,639 --> 00:23:09,420
and just happened to look
cute in that little apron,

286
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:12,860
and something just happened to happen,

287
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:14,859
well that's just nature.

288
00:23:14,859 --> 00:23:18,349
Old Mother Nature, baby,
and we all know she's no bum.

289
00:23:18,349 --> 00:23:21,430
And Wally's not paid up.
Not even close.

290
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:25,639
Anyway, last I heard
you were up against it.

291
00:23:25,639 --> 00:23:31,640
Play your cards right, and within a month
he'll be taking you shoppin' for a divorce!

292
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:36,220
- So, you really think I want to be kept?
- Yes.

293
00:23:57,250 --> 00:24:02,199
My goodness! It's really coming down!

294
00:24:02,199 --> 00:24:05,169
- You ready to go?
- You mean in this?

295
00:24:05,169 --> 00:24:07,629
Well, it's what we said, isn't it?

296
00:24:07,629 --> 00:24:10,740
It's just so awful out! Why don't
I fix you something here tonight

297
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:14,300
- and we can go out some other time...
- Hey, hey, hey, I'm taking you out.

298
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:23,750
Holy smokes. I got no idea, Mildred.

299
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:26,740
I thought the hired
girl did all the cooking.

300
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:29,519
Oh! Goodness. A hired girl.

301
00:24:29,519 --> 00:24:32,970
Not me. Plate's a little hot.

302
00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:44,860
Mildred, that was something.
The pie!

303
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:48,560
Well, that's another thing you might have noticed,
all the times you've been over here.

304
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:53,169
I don't know how much of a bartender I am,
but I'm an awfully good cook.

305
00:24:53,169 --> 00:24:55,240
And the gin!

306
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:58,729
I haven't had real gin
since God knows when.

307
00:24:58,729 --> 00:25:00,479
All they serve in these speaks is smoke,

308
00:25:00,479 --> 00:25:03,190
and a guy's taking his
life in his hands, to boot.

309
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:05,630
Well, I'm glad you enjoyed it.

310
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:13,550
As soon as the cook gets
these dishes out of sight,

311
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:17,230
she's going to put on a warmer dress.

312
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:19,190
You need any help?

313
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:23,120
I could see giving those
apron strings a pull.

314
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:27,720
You do and I might just put it on you,
make you do the dishes.

315
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:52,780
I thought you might need a little help.

316
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:55,940
I don't need help.

317
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:00,410
And I didn't ask you to come in here.

318
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:04,080
Jesus...

319
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,640
Gosh, I'm sorry, Mildred.

320
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:14,040
I just come in to pull on those apron strings,
you know, as a gag.

321
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:18,680
You know I wouldn't pull
any cheap tricks on you.

322
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,200
Don't move. Don't move! Don't move.

323
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,660
Penny?

324
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:43,110
Nothing, really.

325
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:44,950
Just thinking about Bert.

326
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:48,660
Bert?

327
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:52,070
What's there to think about him?

328
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:56,920
Bert's a good friend.
A goddamn good friend.

329
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:01,540
Well, that's rich.

330
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:03,710
Not to me, it's not.

331
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:07,720
A good friend.

332
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:13,250
But not so goddamn good that you wouldn't
block him out of a job he was entitled to,

333
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:17,230
then go around playing politics
so you can get it for yourself.

334
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:20,560
It was Bert who started Pierce Homes,
you may recall.

335
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:26,250
Bert owned farmland. The developers
came knocking. He got lucky, that's all.

336
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:28,870
Anyway, it's no good cussing,
Mildred, coming from you.

337
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:32,190
Well, double-crossing's no good,
coming from anybody.

338
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:33,820
I don't like that.

339
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,820
I don't care whether
you like it or not.

340
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:38,880
They needed a lawyer.

341
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:42,760
After you talked to them, they did!

342
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:45,460
Oh yes, at least a dozen
people came to Bert,

343
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:49,480
and warned him what you were doing and
begged him to go down and put his claim in,

344
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,510
but he wouldn't do it.

345
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:53,380
He didn't think it was proper.

346
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:58,060
Till he found out what was proper,
and what a pal you were.

347
00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:00,380
That's... Mildred, I swear to you,
I give you my word!

348
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:02,830
What's that worth, exactly?

349
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:06,250
Why don't you tell the truth, Wally?

350
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:09,950
You've gotten what you came for,
haven't you? A drink, a dinner,

351
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:11,620
some things I'd prefer not to mention.

352
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:15,510
And now you want to duck,
so you start talking about Bert.

353
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:17,680
Funny how you didn't talk about
Bert when you came in here,

354
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:20,120
wanting to pull those apron strings.
You remember them, don't you?

355
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:22,860
- I didn't hear you saying no.
- No, I was a sap!

356
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:25,480
And you're just like all the rest!

357
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:38,640
- I'm sorry, Wally.
- No, hell, it's all right.

358
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:42,050
- I've been a little upset lately.
- Who wouldn't be?

359
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:52,450
Say, doll!
How'd it go last night?

360
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:57,960
Well, I'm on the town.

361
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:00,700
Yeah? How's it feel?

362
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:03,250
Fast.

363
00:30:13,330 --> 00:30:16,230
Figueroa and Sixth. Watch your step.

364
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:17,660
No, I was...

365
00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:19,100
No.

366
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:38,760
Mrs. Whitby?
It's Mildred Pierce.

367
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:42,570
No, nothing like that.

368
00:33:42,570 --> 00:33:47,580
I just hadn't heard and was wondering if you
wanted your usual order for next week or...

369
00:33:48,250 --> 00:33:50,610
I can do it! I can do it!

370
00:33:50,610 --> 00:33:54,100
Oh. No, certainly.

371
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:57,270
You know where to find me.

372
00:33:57,270 --> 00:34:00,440
- Ray, please.
- Thank you.

373
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,180
Bye now.

374
00:34:03,890 --> 00:34:06,630
- Shoot.
- What is it, Mother?

375
00:34:07,050 --> 00:34:09,460
Nothing, dear. Everything's fine.

376
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,320
Mother, I wish you wouldn't worry so.

377
00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:15,290
I just know everything's going
to work itself out. I know it will.

378
00:34:16,130 --> 00:34:17,530
Remember?

379
00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:21,650
"Do your duty and a little more and
the future will take care of itself."

380
00:34:21,650 --> 00:34:23,730
Aw, cut the mush.

381
00:34:24,950 --> 00:34:29,020
Now what? Veda, finish up then help
your sister gather her school things.

382
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:30,760
- It's a quarter past.
- Yes, Mother.

383
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:31,460
Hello?

384
00:34:31,950 --> 00:34:33,940
- Come on, Ray, we need to finish up.
- Yes?

385
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:37,420
Mrs. Turner!

386
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:40,770
Of course I remember.
From the employment agency...

387
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:43,010
It did?

388
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,580
Of course, certainly.

389
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:49,230
I'll be there as soon as... I will.

390
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:50,670
Thank you, Mrs. Turner.

391
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:53,620
- Thank you.
- You see?

392
00:34:55,830 --> 00:34:57,080
Yes.

393
00:34:57,820 --> 00:35:01,450
Now, hurry up and finish, you two.

394
00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:04,390
You're going to be late for school!

395
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:08,900
The agency doesn't normally handle domestic help,
so this one's strictly off the books.

396
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:11,370
I was over in Beverly the other night,

397
00:35:11,830 --> 00:35:15,740
and I got talking to this lady
that's going to marry this director.

398
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:19,590
He doesn't know it yet,
but his house is in for a big shake-up.

399
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:24,210
So she needs a housekeeper.

400
00:35:24,210 --> 00:35:28,640
And on account of all that fine domestic
efficiency you were telling me about,

401
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,680
I told her about you.

402
00:35:34,850 --> 00:35:36,870
Well, I hardly know what to say.

403
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:42,370
You see I recently came
across a similar job, as...

404
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:46,100
- A waitress, and...
- And you turned it down?

405
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:53,940
I couldn't...
I just can't go home

406
00:35:54,850 --> 00:35:58,030
and face my children knowing their
mother works all day at taking tips

407
00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:01,810
and wearing a uniform
and mopping up crumbs.

408
00:36:01,810 --> 00:36:05,310
But you can face them just fine
when there's nothing left to eat?

409
00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:07,530
That will never be the case, Mrs. Turner.

410
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:10,590
I'd...

411
00:36:12,010 --> 00:36:15,410
I'm extremely grateful that you thought of me,
though I can't see why you did.

412
00:36:15,410 --> 00:36:18,880
And certainly I'll go over there,
as a courtesy to you.

413
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,220
What have I got to do with it?

414
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:24,720
You either you want it or you don't.

415
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:28,080
Listen. I've got my own
little business, sure.

416
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:33,220
But if that went bust and I had to
choose between my belly and my pride,

417
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:38,460
I'm telling you right now,
I'm picking my belly every time.

418
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:42,240
You want to know
why I recommended you?

419
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:46,910
Sure, you've got a head on your
shoulders and a good physique.

420
00:36:46,910 --> 00:36:51,580
But you let half your life slip by
without anything but sleeping, cooking,

421
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:56,290
and setting the table, and lo and behold,
that's all you're good for.

422
00:36:56,290 --> 00:36:58,760
So get over it.

423
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:02,000
Housekeeper?

424
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,420
- Yes, I was sent by...
- Back door.

425
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:45,340
Mrs. Forrester will be with you shortly.

426
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:03,850
How do you do?
I'm Mrs. Forrester.

427
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,360
How do you do?

428
00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:21,890
It's customary, Mildred, for the servant
to sit on the Mistress' invitation,

429
00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:24,260
not on her own initiative.

430
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:28,930
It's perfectly all right,

431
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:33,640
but on little things,
especially with an inexperienced woman,

432
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:36,830
I find it well to
begin at the beginning.

433
00:38:36,830 --> 00:38:38,610
Do sit down.

434
00:38:38,610 --> 00:38:39,820
We've many things to talk about,

435
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:43,560
and it'll make me quite uncomfortable
to have you standing there.

436
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:46,380
This is all right.

437
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:51,860
Mildred, I invited you to sit down.

438
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,810
Now.

439
00:39:04,570 --> 00:39:08,780
As the employment agency
people no doubt informed you,

440
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:12,670
Mr. Lenhardt and I are
to be married next month,

441
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:19,220
and I am determined to bring this
mausoleum of his into the 20th century.

442
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:24,240
And I shall need a highly capable
person to take charge of the plans.

443
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,180
Now.

444
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:30,300
Private quarters are above the garage,
around back,

445
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:35,320
and your daughters are welcome
to come and live with you there.

446
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:40,190
I, myself, have two children
from my previous marriage,

447
00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:44,650
though, of course, fraternization between
the children would not be permitted.

448
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:49,800
I don't foresee a problem, though, seeing
as you'd have your own entrance on the lane

449
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:54,810
and, whatever the case, any such
concerns can certainly be taken care of.

450
00:39:54,810 --> 00:39:58,410
I don't think I'm quite the person
that you want here, Mrs. Forrester.

451
00:39:58,410 --> 00:40:00,100
I beg your pardon?

452
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:03,510
I don't think I'm quite
the person for the job.

453
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:05,500
If you'll excuse me.

454
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:07,730
The mistress terminates
the interview, Mildred.

455
00:40:07,730 --> 00:40:10,460
Mrs. Pierce, if you don't mind.

456
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:12,460
And I'm terminating it.

457
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,790
- Harris will show you out.
- I'll find my way.

458
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:44,150
Nine have been arrested for attacking
white girls! Read all about it!

459
00:40:45,770 --> 00:40:48,400
<i>Get your Times here for five cents!</i>

460
00:40:55,870 --> 00:41:00,350
Nine have been arrested
for attacking white girls!

461
00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:03,190
Read all about it!

462
00:41:04,770 --> 00:41:07,120
<i>Get your Times here!
Only a nickel!</i>

463
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:11,830
Extra! Extra! Read all about it!

464
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:17,960
Riot feared in Scottsboro, Alabama!
Nine arrested for attacking white girls!

465
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:05,410
I'll just get a ham sandwich with lettuce,
a glass of milk, and please,

466
00:42:05,410 --> 00:42:07,860
- just as soon as...
- Coming right up.

467
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:14,880
Here you go.

468
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:17,810
Thank you.

469
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:27,000
I don't know what newspapers
you're reading, pal.

470
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,370
<i>The Times, The Chronicle.</i>

471
00:43:29,370 --> 00:43:31,230
All the editorial pages say the same...

472
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:33,370
Check the crime blotter.
That's where the real news is.

473
00:43:33,370 --> 00:43:34,820
Well, they say next year at the latest.

474
00:43:35,030 --> 00:43:36,990
Word on the street says different.

475
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:39,700
Oh, you didn't care for it?

476
00:43:40,010 --> 00:43:41,660
<i>Well, it's no Flesh and the Devil, anyway.</i>

477
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:45,020
I just think she's heaven on screen.
I could watch her sleep.

478
00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:47,890
- Oh, Garbo snores!
- The usual?

479
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:12,760
You!

480
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:17,420
You dirty little crook! I caught you red-handed!
I caught you right in the act!

481
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:21,000
I caught her! She's been doing it right along,
she's been stealing tips off my tables!

482
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,720
She stole ten cents off table 18,
right after that lady sat down,

483
00:44:24,050 --> 00:44:28,410
and just now she stole fifteen off a forty-cent tip
right under my nose, and I seen her do it!

484
00:44:28,410 --> 00:44:30,600
All right! Quiet down, both of you!

485
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:33,820
- We got no time for this!
- Ida, what the hell you got out here?

486
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:37,490
- Anna says she caught Doris is stealin' my tips!
- Doris glommin' tips. I just seen her steal off of table 14!

487
00:44:37,490 --> 00:44:39,390
That's it. Both of you, you're fired!

488
00:44:39,390 --> 00:44:41,270
- What? I didn't do nothin'!
- What? Mr. Chris!

489
00:44:41,270 --> 00:44:43,260
Oh, no?
You turn my place into boxing ring!

490
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:46,210
- That's it! You are out!
- No! That's so unfair!

491
00:44:46,210 --> 00:44:49,070
I don't need this kind of treatment.
The nerve!

492
00:44:49,070 --> 00:44:53,550
Ladies and gentlemen, I apologize
for such commotion, okay?

493
00:44:53,550 --> 00:44:55,040
Please...

494
00:44:55,310 --> 00:44:58,110
And then? We got... We got two waitresses gone,
we got a whole lunch train,

495
00:44:58,110 --> 00:44:59,590
what do you expect?

496
00:45:02,150 --> 00:45:04,340
- Mr. Chris, we don't have time for this.
- I am trying to keep...

497
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:07,370
Girls! Please! You're not helping us!

498
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:09,890
Get out. Get out!

499
00:45:10,110 --> 00:45:11,880
Somebody get out now.

500
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:29,813
You've got to put somebody on.
It's a mess out there!

501
00:45:29,813 --> 00:45:32,920
Yes, because everybody is
here ignoring their tables!

502
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:36,520
I'm telling you, Mr. Chris, this is a lunch train.
You gum up the tracks, you lose.

503
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:38,350
What's this?

504
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:40,670
Oh, you mean to tell me she's
here to take over for me?

505
00:45:40,670 --> 00:45:43,192
- Oh, no! Nothing doing!
- Who is she?

506
00:45:43,192 --> 00:45:45,170
No way does Anna get the boot
for some ankle off the street.

507
00:45:45,170 --> 00:45:48,330
- If it wasn't for Anna, we'd all be gettin' our tips nicked.
- Wait a minute, wait a minute!

508
00:45:48,330 --> 00:45:51,090
You. You here to work?

509
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:54,910
Well, yes, if you...

510
00:45:54,910 --> 00:45:57,390
That's it, I'm quits!
No way am I staying with her!

511
00:45:57,390 --> 00:45:59,820
How can you drag in some dame off the
street just 'cause Anna had the guts to...

512
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:05,970
Okay, okay, cut the hoo-ha!

513
00:46:06,670 --> 00:46:09,440
Anna and the new girl stay.

514
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:10,840
Now go, go, go! Go!

515
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:12,670
- Thank you very much.
- Go, go.

516
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:22,270
Study that while I find you something.
Prices specially.

517
00:46:22,710 --> 00:46:24,280
What size you wear?

518
00:46:25,170 --> 00:46:26,450
Ten.

519
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:29,660
You ever work in a restaurant?

520
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:31,120
No.

521
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:37,960
Your uniform comes off the first check.

522
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:40,320
$3.95, and you keep it laundered.

523
00:46:40,540 --> 00:46:43,200
The pay is 25 cents an hour,
and you keep your own tips.

524
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:46,120
And what's your name, miss?

525
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:48,000
Ida. Yours?

526
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,480
Mildred Pierce.

527
00:46:50,210 --> 00:46:52,740
I'm giving you a light station, see?
Tables 1 through 6.

528
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:55,610
That's so's you don't get no fours.
Singles and two's are easier.

529
00:46:56,150 --> 00:46:59,000
Now, all them that's just come in, you take them,
I'll cover the others. Come on.

530
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:02,430
Now you show, after two stiffs,
one goose cursing at me non-stop

531
00:47:02,430 --> 00:47:04,250
and two fours about to torch the place!

532
00:47:04,250 --> 00:47:06,010
So here you mark your number.
You're number 9.

533
00:47:06,010 --> 00:47:08,690
Here you mark the number of the table,
and here the number of customers on the check,

534
00:47:08,690 --> 00:47:10,720
and down here, everything they order.

535
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:13,280
Now, you got to account
for every check, see?

536
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:16,890
If you make a mistake, it's deducted,
and you got to pay for it. Got it?

537
00:47:16,890 --> 00:47:18,770
- Got it.
- Go.

538
00:47:30,890 --> 00:47:32,050
Can I help you?

539
00:47:32,050 --> 00:47:34,540
Well, we're not sure we're
having anything at all.

540
00:47:34,540 --> 00:47:36,670
What kind of place is this, anyway,

541
00:47:36,670 --> 00:47:39,820
letting people sit around and not even
asking them if they minded waiting?

542
00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:43,000
Well, it's been a...
little trouble earlier,

543
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,920
but if you could just
be patient for a moment,

544
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:49,210
I'll see that you're served at once.

545
00:47:51,590 --> 00:47:54,460
The roast chicken is awfully good today.

546
00:47:54,750 --> 00:47:58,580
Well then. I'll have the
67-cent lunch with chicken.

547
00:47:58,580 --> 00:47:59,670
I'll do the same.

548
00:47:59,670 --> 00:48:04,470
But see to it that there's no gravy
on mine in any way, shape or form.

549
00:48:04,470 --> 00:48:08,600
- I hate brown gravy.
- Yes, miss. I'll remember.

550
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:12,930
I bet you ten dollars she
puts brown gravy on mine.

551
00:48:12,930 --> 00:48:15,580
The train was derailed, boys,
but we're chugging again.

552
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:21,160
Two roast chicken. One without gravy.

553
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:24,500
"Hold" one gravy. "Hold" it.
You gotta call it right!

554
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:26,670
You can't work nowhere without
you're in good with the chef.

555
00:48:26,670 --> 00:48:28,570
You gotta call it right for him.

556
00:48:28,570 --> 00:48:30,560
Never "without," always "hold."

557
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:32,000
Yes, miss.

558
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,360
Hold!

559
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:36,850
Pick up your starters.
Pick up your starters!

560
00:48:40,210 --> 00:48:41,810
Have they got water?

561
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:45,750
- Uh, not yet.
- Oh, for crying out loud.

562
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:49,030
Okay, get in there.

563
00:48:49,450 --> 00:48:50,400
Well,

564
00:48:51,310 --> 00:48:53,260
can I have a tray?

565
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,890
Get the soup! The soup!

566
00:49:03,630 --> 00:49:06,540
She's new. Very new.

567
00:49:11,830 --> 00:49:13,550
Good work, January.

568
00:49:18,050 --> 00:49:19,570
Pick up something.

569
00:49:19,570 --> 00:49:22,590
Don't never make a trip, in or out,
without something in your hand.

570
00:49:22,590 --> 00:49:24,160
Grab that!

571
00:50:51,090 --> 00:50:54,630
Mildred, you're short 35 cents
on table 5.

572
00:50:54,630 --> 00:50:55,680
What?

573
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:19,780
Personally, Mildred,
I don't think you're suited for it.

574
00:51:19,780 --> 00:51:22,550
And Mr. Chris was not a bit impressed.

575
00:51:22,550 --> 00:51:27,150
But the chef thinks you'll do,
so we're giving you a trial.

576
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:33,430
Well, please thank Archie for me and
tell him I hope I won't disappoint him.

577
00:51:37,090 --> 00:51:42,130
Your hours are 11:00 in the morning,
10:30 if you want breakfast, to 3:00 in the afternoon.

578
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:46,490
We don't do a big dinner train,
but most girls are on call twice a week,

579
00:51:46,490 --> 00:51:48,810
5:00 to 9:00, same wages as daytime.

580
00:51:48,810 --> 00:51:50,750
And we're closed Sundays.

581
00:51:50,750 --> 00:51:52,470
You'll need white shoes.

582
00:51:52,470 --> 00:51:56,690
Ask for nurses' regulation
at any of the stores, $2.95.

583
00:51:58,850 --> 00:52:02,480
What's the matter, Mildred?
You don't want the job?

584
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:06,260
I'm a little tired, is all.

585
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:09,500
I don't wonder, the way you trot.

586
00:52:26,330 --> 00:52:29,470
Hold still, Ray!
I can't do it if you keep squirming!

587
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:31,450
'Cause it's hurting!

588
00:52:31,450 --> 00:52:35,330
Mrs. Gessler, do you know the name of
Catherine Earnshaw's immortal beloved

589
00:52:35,330 --> 00:52:37,300
<i>in Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights?</i>

590
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:40,270
- I can't say I do, Veda.
- It's quite famous.

591
00:52:40,270 --> 00:52:42,890
Will you girls be all right
while I speak to Mrs. Gessler?

592
00:52:42,890 --> 00:52:44,280
Yes, Mother.

593
00:52:45,590 --> 00:52:46,840
Now hold still.

594
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:50,940
He phoned around 9:00, saying he had
a hurry call that might keep him out.

595
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:54,220
Didn't see him till 10:00 this morning.

596
00:52:54,220 --> 00:52:58,150
Sure, all in his line of business,
but just the same.

597
00:52:58,150 --> 00:53:01,750
Lucy, can I borrow $3?

598
00:53:02,470 --> 00:53:03,850
More, if you want.

599
00:53:03,850 --> 00:53:06,530
No. Thanks.

600
00:53:07,860 --> 00:53:11,020
I just need a few things.

601
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:15,430
I've taken a job.

602
00:53:15,430 --> 00:53:21,160
- A job? What kind of job?
- Just a job.

603
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:27,120
Then I hope for your sake you
picked a $5 house and not a $2.

604
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:31,110
I'm a waitress.

605
00:53:33,860 --> 00:53:36,170
In a hash house.

606
00:53:36,170 --> 00:53:38,370
Sort of rhymes up the same way.

607
00:53:39,190 --> 00:53:41,360
Just about.

608
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:44,400
That's funny.
And I know it's none of my business,

609
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:48,160
but all that time you
were answering those ads,

610
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:51,710
trying to get hired on as a saleswoman,
receptionist, whatever it was,

611
00:53:52,090 --> 00:53:56,240
I kept wondering to myself why
you didn't try something like this.

612
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:57,460
Why?

613
00:53:57,460 --> 00:54:00,230
Suppose you did get
a job as a saleswoman?

614
00:54:00,230 --> 00:54:02,430
Who's buying any goods?

615
00:54:02,430 --> 00:54:04,640
You'd be standing around
some store all day,

616
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:08,160
just waiting for the chance to
make a living and never making it.

617
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:09,660
People eat, though.

618
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:11,280
Even now.

619
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:16,010
It might sound funny, but,
at selling, I'd say you weren't the type,

620
00:54:16,010 --> 00:54:19,930
but at this, I don't know why...

621
00:54:19,930 --> 00:54:22,190
Mildred. Oh, no!

622
00:54:24,550 --> 00:54:28,080
Oh, honey, just let it come.
Let it come.

623
00:54:32,230 --> 00:54:34,110
I can't do it, Lucy!

624
00:54:35,810 --> 00:54:37,340
I just can't!

625
00:54:39,220 --> 00:54:41,070
Do what?

626
00:54:41,070 --> 00:54:43,640
Wear a uniform.

627
00:54:43,990 --> 00:54:48,210
Take their tips.
Face those awful people.

628
00:54:48,210 --> 00:54:51,840
They call me names! One of them...
One of them grabbed me...

629
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:55,570
- Put his hand clear up... Clear up...
- What do they pay you?

630
00:54:55,570 --> 00:54:59,270
- 25 cents an hour.
- And tips extra?

631
00:55:00,150 --> 00:55:01,820
Baby, you're nuts.

632
00:55:01,820 --> 00:55:03,960
Those tips will bring in
a couple of dollars a day,

633
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:08,600
and before you know it,
you'll be making $15, $20 a week, at least.

634
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:12,060
More money than you've seen
since Pierce Homes blew up.

635
00:55:12,270 --> 00:55:14,600
You've got to do it, for your own sake.

636
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:17,890
Nobody pays attention to
that uniform stuff anymore.

637
00:55:18,110 --> 00:55:21,610
I bet you look cute in that uniform.

638
00:55:21,610 --> 00:55:26,030
- And besides, people have to do what they can...
- No, Lucy, stop! I'll go mad!

639
00:55:26,030 --> 00:55:29,510
I'll... That's what...
That's what everyone's been telling me,

640
00:55:29,510 --> 00:55:32,970
the employment people, everybody, that...
That all I'm good for

641
00:55:33,390 --> 00:55:37,860
is waiting tables and
putting on a uniform.

642
00:55:37,860 --> 00:55:39,460
And maybe they're right.

643
00:55:39,460 --> 00:55:43,020
Because maybe what they're trying to
tell you is what I'm trying to tell you.

644
00:55:43,020 --> 00:55:45,080
You're in a spot.

645
00:55:45,550 --> 00:55:48,770
You're starving to death, baby.

646
00:55:49,860 --> 00:55:53,210
Don't you suppose my
heart's been heavy for you?

647
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:59,320
Don't you know I'd have brought a roast
beef in here, or a ham, whatever I had,

648
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:03,740
every night of the week,
except that I knew you'd hate me for it?

649
00:56:05,260 --> 00:56:09,640
Oh honey,
you've just got to take this job.

650
00:56:10,060 --> 00:56:13,360
I know it. I can't.

651
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:16,190
But I've got to.

652
00:56:16,530 --> 00:56:19,590
Then if you've got to,
you've got to, so quit bawling.

653
00:56:21,710 --> 00:56:27,720
Lucy, promise me one thing.
Promise you won't tell a soul.

654
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:29,410
Hell, I won't even tell Ike.

655
00:56:29,410 --> 00:56:33,200
I don't care about Ike,
or any of these people, what they think.

656
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:36,430
It's on account of the children.
The chance of them finding out.

657
00:56:36,430 --> 00:56:44,340
I just... I just can't have them knowing
anything about it. Veda in particular.

658
00:56:44,340 --> 00:56:47,810
Veda, if you ask me,
has some funny ideas.

659
00:56:47,810 --> 00:56:50,770
You don't understand her, Lucy.

660
00:56:50,770 --> 00:56:57,190
No, she has something in her that...
That I thought I had.

661
00:56:58,940 --> 00:57:02,230
And now find I don't.

662
00:57:03,020 --> 00:57:08,940
Pride, or nobility, or whatever it is.

663
00:57:09,420 --> 00:57:15,190
That pride, I wouldn't give a snap of my finger for it.
But you're right about her.

664
00:57:16,530 --> 00:57:20,750
Veda wouldn't do it herself,
but she's willing to let you do it and eat the cake.

665
00:57:20,750 --> 00:57:24,800
That's what I want, for both of them.

666
00:57:25,910 --> 00:57:27,830
Not just bread.

667
00:57:30,064 --> 00:57:32,224
All the cake in the world.

668
00:59:04,758 --> 00:59:12,330
<i>♪ I'm always chasing rainbows. ♪</i>

669
00:59:12,330 --> 00:59:19,671
<i>♪ Watching clouds drifting by. ♪</i>

670
00:59:19,671 --> 00:59:26,777
<i>♪ My schemes are just like all my dreams... ♪
Father! Come over here!</i>

671
00:59:26,777 --> 00:59:31,615
<i>♪ Ending in the sky. ♪
Daddy, Daddy, Daddy!</i>

672
00:59:31,615 --> 00:59:33,550
Ha, ha, ha.
Look at both of you.

673
00:59:33,550 --> 00:59:35,953
I think you've gotten taller since last week,
when I saw you at Grandma's.

674
00:59:35,953 --> 00:59:38,355
Who's the tallest?
Let's play who's grown the best.

675
00:59:38,355 --> 00:59:39,756
Me! Me! Me!

676
00:59:39,756 --> 00:59:41,257
- Yep, two inches for Veda...
- Daddy's here, Mommy!

677
00:59:41,257 --> 00:59:45,328
- And two, maybe three for Ray!
- Father!

678
00:59:45,328 --> 00:59:46,529
- Say there, Mildred.
- I'm three! I'm three!

679
00:59:46,529 --> 00:59:48,397
Just thought I'd drop
by for a little visit.

680
00:59:48,397 --> 00:59:51,500
Maybe pick up a couple of
things I left in the desk.

681
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:53,402
Well, I'm glad you did.

682
00:59:53,402 --> 00:59:55,404
Shall we all go in the den?

683
00:59:55,404 --> 00:59:57,505
- Now there's an idea.
- Yes! Father!

684
00:59:57,505 --> 00:59:59,141
These two treating
you all right, Mildred?

685
00:59:59,141 --> 01:00:00,275
Make yourself comfortable.

686
01:00:00,275 --> 01:00:03,312
They both had very good
report cards this term.

687
01:00:03,312 --> 01:00:06,114
And Veda's doing splendidly
on her piano practice.

688
01:00:06,114 --> 01:00:09,117
I'm learning the Polonaise in A-flat,
by Chopin.

689
01:00:09,117 --> 01:00:12,420
It's such a wonderful piece, Father.
I can't wait for you to hear it.

690
01:00:12,420 --> 01:00:15,122
Guess all those matinees your mother
dragged us to at the Hollywood Bowl

691
01:00:15,122 --> 01:00:16,523
paid off in the end.

692
01:00:16,523 --> 01:00:18,025
Huh?

693
01:00:18,025 --> 01:00:20,194
Look, Daddy! See what I wear
in the pageant at school!

694
01:00:20,194 --> 01:00:21,929
Queen of May Pageant,
it's called.

695
01:00:21,929 --> 01:00:23,764
Doesn't it look like real gold?

696
01:00:23,764 --> 01:00:25,733
It sure does.

697
01:00:25,733 --> 01:00:29,702
Betty Troke is May Queen,
which is perfectly ridiculous if you ask me,

698
01:00:29,702 --> 01:00:32,038
even if she did just
move from Pasadena.

699
01:00:32,038 --> 01:00:34,540
- That's because Veda thinks she should be it.
- Oh!

700
01:00:34,540 --> 01:00:36,943
- That is not true. That is a lie.
- Veda!

701
01:00:38,679 --> 01:00:41,614
Oh, Daddy! Can I show Daddy
my new sand bucket Grandpa got me?

702
01:00:41,614 --> 01:00:45,017
Grandpa got me a sand bucket.
It has a tiger and a clown.

703
01:00:45,017 --> 01:00:48,153
Well, the bucket's in the garage, dear.
Let's show it to him later.

704
01:00:48,153 --> 01:00:49,821
- Hmm?
- Yeah.

705
01:00:49,821 --> 01:00:52,224
Aren't you terribly thirsty, Father?

706
01:00:52,224 --> 01:00:55,560
- Mother, would you like me to open the scotch?
- Scotch?

707
01:00:55,560 --> 01:00:58,864
Yes, Daddy! We're going to have a drink!
We're going to get drunk!

708
01:00:58,864 --> 01:01:00,732
Well, I might be able
to stand a drink.

709
01:01:00,732 --> 01:01:03,701
Drink, drink, drink!
Daddy's gonna drink!

710
01:01:03,701 --> 01:01:08,006
I'm gonna drink!
I'm gonna drink!

711
01:01:10,675 --> 01:01:13,744
Can I help you, Mother?

712
01:01:13,744 --> 01:01:16,447
Who asked you to go snooping
around my closet for liquor?

713
01:01:17,949 --> 01:01:20,317
I didn't know there
was any secret about it.

714
01:01:20,317 --> 01:01:22,986
And hereafter,
I'll do the inviting.

715
01:01:22,986 --> 01:01:25,655
But, Mother, it's Father.

716
01:01:25,655 --> 01:01:28,558
Don't stand there and pretend
you don't know what I'm talking about.

717
01:01:28,558 --> 01:01:30,961
You know you had no business
saying what you did.

718
01:01:30,961 --> 01:01:33,095
I could tell by the
cheeky look on your face.

719
01:01:35,732 --> 01:01:38,167
Very well, Mother.
It shall be as you say.

720
01:01:38,167 --> 01:01:41,103
And stop that silly
way of talking.

721
01:01:41,103 --> 01:01:45,474
Just the same, there was none of this
stinginess when Father was doing the inviting.

722
01:01:45,474 --> 01:01:48,544
Things have truly changed around here.
One might think

723
01:01:48,544 --> 01:01:50,812
peasants have taken
over the house.

724
01:01:50,812 --> 01:01:52,981
Do you even know
what a peasant is?

725
01:01:52,981 --> 01:01:58,453
A peasant...
is a very ill-bred person.

726
01:01:58,453 --> 01:02:02,490
Drive around the house, or
are you going to show me what it looks like?

727
01:02:02,490 --> 01:02:06,560
Sometimes, Veda,
I wonder if you have good sense.

728
01:02:08,663 --> 01:02:09,896
Go on.

729
01:02:21,175 --> 01:02:23,977
Oh, Veda. No, we weren't
talking about you at all.

730
01:02:33,287 --> 01:02:37,456
These children are turning
into such rummies these days.

731
01:02:37,456 --> 01:02:40,325
I don't know what the younger
generation is coming to.

732
01:02:44,597 --> 01:02:48,233
Father, you switched them.
You always switch them.

733
01:02:48,233 --> 01:02:52,637
- We want the stiff ones!
- Those are the stiff ones.

734
01:02:52,637 --> 01:02:56,641
So, Father... What's your opinion
on the current economic conditions?

735
01:02:56,641 --> 01:02:59,276
Do you think things will
be improving anytime soon?

736
01:02:59,276 --> 01:03:03,748
Well, that's a fine question, Veda.
Truly is.

737
01:03:03,748 --> 01:03:06,718
Hoover's not out of it yet.
I'll tell you that much, and

738
01:03:06,718 --> 01:03:09,453
while it's not looking
rosy anytime soon,

739
01:03:09,453 --> 01:03:12,188
I do see some signs
of improvement.

740
01:03:12,188 --> 01:03:15,692
Capone... Lindbergh,
all the way to China!

741
01:03:15,692 --> 01:03:18,428
Father, I'm serious.

742
01:03:18,428 --> 01:03:21,565
Look, I'm drunk! I'm drunk!

743
01:03:21,565 --> 01:03:26,135
Can't you control her?

744
01:03:26,135 --> 01:03:27,215
Father...

745
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:32,174
♪ I went to the animal's fair. ♪

746
01:03:32,174 --> 01:03:34,410
♪ The birds and the
bees were there. ♪

747
01:03:34,410 --> 01:03:38,681

751
01:03:54,530 --> 01:03:57,631
All right, all right, all right.

752
01:03:57,631 --> 01:04:01,569
It's time for bed for
both monketys. Hmm?

753
01:04:04,305 --> 01:04:06,740
- How about their father tucks them in?
- Yes! Yes!

754
01:04:08,009 --> 01:04:09,910
Father, do I have to?

755
01:04:09,910 --> 01:04:11,645
It's so late.

756
01:04:11,645 --> 01:04:13,580
- Why can't Daddy do this every night?
- You know your mother.

757
01:04:15,916 --> 01:04:17,984
Can you at least read to us?

758
01:04:17,984 --> 01:04:19,886
From Robert Louis Stevenson?

759
01:04:26,193 --> 01:04:29,361
You, uh, got what you
needed from the desk?

760
01:04:29,361 --> 01:04:30,495
Yeah, I...

761
01:04:33,866 --> 01:04:35,433
You drop something?

762
01:04:35,433 --> 01:04:37,636
My key.

763
01:04:37,636 --> 01:04:41,406
- It was in my pocket. I always put it in my...
- Come to think of it...

764
01:04:41,406 --> 01:04:42,641
Maybe I took that key.

765
01:04:44,410 --> 01:04:46,176
- You what?
- I took it.

766
01:04:50,782 --> 01:04:53,084
- Gimme it. I gotta go home.
- No, I won't.

767
01:04:54,219 --> 01:04:56,520
I'm not gonna give it to you.

768
01:04:56,520 --> 01:04:59,490
And there's no use trying to take it from me,
because I need it now and you don't.

769
01:04:59,490 --> 01:05:01,092
What are you talking about?
That car's mine.

770
01:05:01,092 --> 01:05:04,227
I don't care whose it is.

771
01:05:04,227 --> 01:05:06,462
I'm working and I need it.

772
01:05:06,462 --> 01:05:10,066
And, if you think I'm gonna
pound around on my feet and

773
01:05:10,066 --> 01:05:15,038
ride buses and lose all that time and be a sap,
while you lay up with another woman,

774
01:05:15,038 --> 01:05:18,573
enjoying the high life,
well, you're quite mistaken.

775
01:05:18,573 --> 01:05:20,175
- You're working?
- Yes.

776
01:05:20,175 --> 01:05:22,945
I got a job.
And don't ask me where.

777
01:05:22,945 --> 01:05:24,947
Somebody had to.

778
01:05:24,947 --> 01:05:28,684
- Well, why didn't you say so?
- Fine.

779
01:05:30,887 --> 01:05:32,154
Then it's settled.

780
01:05:34,757 --> 01:05:35,823
Thank you.

781
01:05:40,462 --> 01:05:44,931
- I can ride you back, if you like.
- Appreciate it very much.

782
01:05:50,639 --> 01:05:51,938
You staying with Maggie?

783
01:05:54,676 --> 01:05:57,110
Prefer not to say
where I'm staying.

784
01:05:57,110 --> 01:05:58,578
I'm staying where I'm staying.

785
01:06:04,051 --> 01:06:06,852
But you can drop me off at Maggie's.
That's fine.

786
01:06:14,661 --> 01:06:15,727
Good night.

787
01:06:40,785 --> 01:06:42,920
BLT, high and dry,
three eggs, wreck 'em.

788
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:44,589
I need a full house,
hold the pickle.

789
01:06:44,589 --> 01:06:45,989
I need two specials, Archie.

790
01:06:45,989 --> 01:06:47,490
Where's my livers? Thank you.

791
01:06:47,490 --> 01:06:50,026
Where's my shrimp order?

792
01:06:50,026 --> 01:06:52,862
Archie, where's my shrimp?
I told you, don't keep me waiting.

793
01:07:02,839 --> 01:07:04,340
Now, now.

794
01:07:04,340 --> 01:07:07,209
Now is right!

795
01:07:08,645 --> 01:07:10,479
You call this pie?

796
01:07:10,479 --> 01:07:12,748
I'm sorry, Mr. Rice.

797
01:07:17,120 --> 01:07:18,786
And a special straw
for the little one.

798
01:07:18,786 --> 01:07:21,122
Oh, thank you.
That's just what she needs.

799
01:07:24,025 --> 01:07:27,962
Say, Millie.
What do you say I take you out some night?

800
01:07:27,962 --> 01:07:30,398
Oh, no, Mr. Rand.
I want you to keep liking me.

801
01:07:30,398 --> 01:07:33,033
Oh, I'll keep liking you, honest.

802
01:07:33,033 --> 01:07:35,569
You might feel differently
if I wasn't dressed in a uniform.

803
01:07:37,572 --> 01:07:39,473
I'm that ashamed of
putting this on the table.

804
01:07:39,473 --> 01:07:42,242
I'm that ashamed to
ask a customer to eat it.

805
01:07:42,242 --> 01:07:45,479
It's just despicable, the pie you put out here
and expect people to pay for.

806
01:07:45,479 --> 01:07:48,649
Maybe a pie is lousy,
but what you expect, times like this now?

807
01:07:48,649 --> 01:07:51,350
If he no eat, you see me,
I okay a new check.

808
01:07:51,350 --> 01:07:52,685
Bah!

809
01:07:58,392 --> 01:08:01,160
What does he pay for
those pies, anyway?

810
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:03,429
If he pays two bits,
he's getting swindled.

811
01:08:05,098 --> 01:08:06,931
But how much would you say, roughly?

812
01:08:06,931 --> 01:08:09,734
Oh, I don't know. Why?

813
01:08:11,003 --> 01:08:15,973
Ida, I make pies,
and sell them.

814
01:08:15,973 --> 01:08:19,711
Honestly, if he pays anything at all,
I'd meet his price and

815
01:08:19,711 --> 01:08:22,346
make him some that people
would really want to eat.

816
01:08:22,346 --> 01:08:24,147
I'd make him pies
that'd be a feature.

817
01:08:24,147 --> 01:08:27,351
- You bake pies?
- I do it all the time.

818
01:08:27,351 --> 01:08:29,386
- I sold four last week.
- Well...

819
01:08:29,386 --> 01:08:31,488
Why don't you bring
in a sample sometime?

820
01:08:32,657 --> 01:08:34,658
I could do it tomorrow.

821
01:08:34,658 --> 01:08:36,327
You're serious, aren't you?

822
01:08:36,327 --> 01:08:38,761
- Mmm-hmm.
- Well, why not.

823
01:08:38,761 --> 01:08:41,297
I know for a fact he wants to switch.

824
01:08:41,297 --> 01:08:43,633
He's just too bullheaded to admit it.

825
01:08:47,838 --> 01:08:50,340
You heading home?
Can I give you a lift?

826
01:08:50,340 --> 01:08:52,141
You have a car?

827
01:08:52,141 --> 01:08:53,576
Well... It goes.

828
01:08:55,845 --> 01:08:57,779
I've been knowing it all along,
I had to have a showdown about them pies,

829
01:08:57,779 --> 01:08:59,314
and now it's coming.

830
01:08:59,314 --> 01:09:02,283
So, look, tomorrow,
you bring in three pies.

831
01:09:02,283 --> 01:09:04,319
One apple, one pumpkin,
and one lemon.

832
01:09:04,319 --> 01:09:07,589
- I could do a cherry, too.
- No. No cherry, and no strawberry.

833
01:09:07,589 --> 01:09:09,290
They fall apart too easy.

834
01:09:09,290 --> 01:09:12,159
And just three. No more than three.
And I'll see they get served.

835
01:09:12,159 --> 01:09:15,195
Remember, though,
it's all got to be his idea.

836
01:09:15,195 --> 01:09:16,597
Of course.

837
01:09:16,597 --> 01:09:19,066
And I'll find
out what he pays, too.

838
01:09:19,066 --> 01:09:22,002
You leave it to me, Mildred.
You won't have to say a word.

839
01:09:22,002 --> 01:09:24,905
Ida, you're a pal.

840
01:09:34,749 --> 01:09:36,716
And one lemon pie.

841
01:09:36,716 --> 01:09:39,151
That's some
meringue you got there.

842
01:09:39,151 --> 01:09:41,654
Ma'am, I'd like one of
them pieces too, please.

843
01:09:41,654 --> 01:09:43,722
Nice job on them pies, Mr. Chris.
You sure can pick 'em.

844
01:09:43,722 --> 01:09:46,091
I'll say. And about time, too.

845
01:09:54,267 --> 01:09:58,536
I said, "Hold your horses.
30 cents per pie?

846
01:09:58,536 --> 01:10:00,137
"You pay that bakery 35!"

847
01:10:00,137 --> 01:10:02,673
Yeah. What does he expect?
Something more for something less?

848
01:10:02,673 --> 01:10:04,709
And 35 pies a week?

849
01:10:05,911 --> 01:10:07,445
I'm going to need
to hire some help.

850
01:10:07,445 --> 01:10:10,715
Honey, at 35 cents a pop,
you can almost afford it!

851
01:10:12,718 --> 01:10:14,151
To Mildred, and them pies!

852
01:10:14,151 --> 01:10:16,453
Thank you, Ida. Thank you.

853
01:10:31,234 --> 01:10:32,668
Letty, watch your sleeve!

854
01:10:37,006 --> 01:10:38,741
A little faster.

855
01:10:56,792 --> 01:10:59,894
- Good afternoon, Mrs. Pierce.
- Good afternoon.

856
01:10:59,894 --> 01:11:01,128
Will this be all for you?

857
01:11:19,012 --> 01:11:22,047
Hello? Letty?

858
01:11:27,621 --> 01:11:28,721
Hello?

859
01:11:28,721 --> 01:11:30,422
<i>- Hey, honey.
- Oh, Lucy...</i>

860
01:11:30,422 --> 01:11:32,792
<i>I'm running to Bullocks, and thought
you might want to come along.</i>

861
01:11:32,792 --> 01:11:35,093
<i>- Oh, no, I wish I could.
- Why?</i>

862
01:11:35,093 --> 01:11:39,598
Oh, you'll never guess.
Another restaurant contract dropped in my lap this week.

863
01:11:39,598 --> 01:11:41,265
<i>- Another contract?
- Mmm-hmm.</i>

864
01:11:41,265 --> 01:11:44,235
<i>- With who?
- Mr. Hartman at the Drop Inn.</i>

865
01:11:44,235 --> 01:11:48,540
<i>- Baby, you're takin' off!
- You said it. I'm a going concern!</i>

866
01:11:48,540 --> 01:11:50,108
Yes, Mrs. Pierce?

867
01:11:51,510 --> 01:11:53,343
<i>Mildred?</i>

868
01:11:53,343 --> 01:11:55,012
Lucy, can I call you back?

869
01:11:55,012 --> 01:11:57,848
I have baking supplies in the car...

870
01:11:57,848 --> 01:11:59,550
<i>- You go on, then.
- Thanks.</i>

871
01:12:06,024 --> 01:12:08,825
I told her you wouldn't like it, Mrs. Pierce.
I told her right off the bat.

872
01:12:08,825 --> 01:12:13,095
But, she hollered and carried on,
so I put it on just to keep her quiet.

873
01:12:13,095 --> 01:12:15,231
Who hollered and carried on?

874
01:12:15,231 --> 01:12:19,168
Well... Miss Veda, ma'am.

875
01:12:20,170 --> 01:12:21,404
Miss Veda?

876
01:12:21,404 --> 01:12:23,471
That's what she says
I should call her.

877
01:12:23,471 --> 01:12:26,174
And... She told you to
put on that uniform?

878
01:12:26,174 --> 01:12:27,475
Yes'm.

879
01:12:29,078 --> 01:12:33,351
What on earth does she think she's...

Look!
I ain't so tough!

887
01:12:50,665 --> 01:12:53,034
Where did you find it
and why is Letty wearing it?

888
01:12:54,036 --> 01:12:55,669
Why?

889
01:12:55,669 --> 01:12:58,972
Those uniforms were on the top shelf
of my closet, under a pile of sheets.

890
01:13:00,541 --> 01:13:02,475
Once again...

891
01:13:02,475 --> 01:13:04,310
You were snooping into my things
to see what you could find, weren't you?

892
01:13:04,310 --> 01:13:06,646
- I was looking for a handkerchief.
- Weren't you?

893
01:13:06,646 --> 01:13:09,049
I was not,
and I resent the accusation.

894
01:13:09,049 --> 01:13:12,818
Then... Then how did it
happen to end up on Letty?

895
01:13:12,818 --> 01:13:15,621
I merely assumed, Mother,
that you'd bought them for Letty.

896
01:13:15,621 --> 01:13:17,656
And if she was going to be
taking my things to the pool,

897
01:13:17,656 --> 01:13:20,358
I assumed you wanted
her decently dressed.

898
01:13:20,358 --> 01:13:23,028
To the pool? What things?

899
01:13:23,028 --> 01:13:24,362
My swimming things.

900
01:13:24,362 --> 01:13:27,231
She always walks two
steps behind us to the bus.

901
01:13:27,231 --> 01:13:29,100
And carries our bags both ways.

902
01:13:29,100 --> 01:13:32,169
What?
Does she go in swimming?

903
01:13:32,169 --> 01:13:36,007
No, sir! Because she can't swim!
She can't swim and she'll get drowned.

904
01:13:36,007 --> 01:13:39,410
And Red will have to pull her out.
He's the life guard and he's stuck on her.

905
01:13:39,410 --> 01:13:40,778
Mrs. Pierce?

906
01:13:42,314 --> 01:13:43,747
What?

907
01:13:48,019 --> 01:13:49,886
That... That... That's enough!

908
01:13:49,886 --> 01:13:51,788
I'll be right there, Letty.

909
01:13:51,788 --> 01:13:53,490
Ugh. Really, Mother.

910
01:13:53,490 --> 01:13:56,593
It seems to me your making
a great fuss over nothing.

911
01:13:56,593 --> 01:13:58,794
If you bought the
uniforms for Letty and

912
01:13:58,794 --> 01:14:01,363
certainly, I can't imagine
who else you bought them for,

913
01:14:01,363 --> 01:14:03,332
then why shouldn't
she wear them?

914
01:14:08,805 --> 01:14:09,939
It's time for your bath.

915
01:14:09,939 --> 01:14:12,574
Nooo! No, no, no, no, no, Nooo!

916
01:14:12,574 --> 01:14:15,677
- Stop squirming.

I know she does...

923
01:14:59,186 --> 01:15:01,620
All right, head back.

924
01:15:13,166 --> 01:15:14,433
Veda?

925
01:15:14,433 --> 01:15:17,536
Gracious, Mother!
You startled me.

926
01:15:17,536 --> 01:15:20,605
Why did you give
Letty that uniform?

927
01:15:20,605 --> 01:15:24,709
For Heaven's sake, Mother,
haven't I told you once?

928
01:15:24,709 --> 01:15:26,877
How often do I
have to tell you?

929
01:15:28,113 --> 01:15:29,681
I'm going to bed.

930
01:15:29,681 --> 01:15:33,218
You knew when you gave it to her
that it was mine, didn't you?

931
01:15:34,253 --> 01:15:35,885
That it was my uniform.

932
01:15:36,921 --> 01:15:38,422
Your uniform?

933
01:15:38,422 --> 01:15:39,856
Yes.

934
01:15:42,727 --> 01:15:47,831
It so happens that I've
taken a job in a restaurant.

935
01:15:47,831 --> 01:15:48,965
In Hollywood.

936
01:15:49,967 --> 01:15:51,567
As a what?

937
01:15:51,567 --> 01:15:54,503
As a waitress,
as you well know.

938
01:15:57,407 --> 01:15:58,474
Ye Gods!

939
01:15:59,843 --> 01:16:01,276
- Ye Gods!
- Oh, stop that!

940
01:16:01,276 --> 01:16:03,345
Ye Gods and little fishes!

941
01:16:03,345 --> 01:16:07,415
So you and your sister can eat and have
a place to live, and a few clothes on your backs!

942
01:16:07,415 --> 01:16:11,353
I've taken the only
kind of job I can get.

943
01:16:11,353 --> 01:16:14,456
And if you think I'm going to listen to
a lot of silly nonsense from you about it,

944
01:16:14,456 --> 01:16:16,290
then you're quite mistaken.

945
01:16:16,290 --> 01:16:18,692
And if you think your nonsense
is going to make me

946
01:16:18,692 --> 01:16:22,363
give up the job,
then you're mistaken about that, too.

947
01:16:22,363 --> 01:16:24,799
How you ever found out what I was doing,
I do not know...

948
01:16:24,799 --> 01:16:27,668
From the uniform, stupid.
You think I'm dumb?

949
01:16:31,639 --> 01:16:34,107
You may not realize it, young lady,

950
01:16:34,107 --> 01:16:36,709
but everything you
have costs money...

951
01:16:36,709 --> 01:16:40,847
From the maid you ordered to go
traipsing with you to the pool

952
01:16:40,847 --> 01:16:43,349
to your food and clothes
and everything else.

953
01:16:43,349 --> 01:16:45,752
And, as I don't see anyone else
doing anything about it around here...

954
01:16:45,752 --> 01:16:47,353
Aren't the pies bad enough?

955
01:16:47,353 --> 01:16:49,656
Did you have to go and degrade us all
by becoming a waitress?

956
01:16:49,656 --> 01:16:53,693
That... That's quite enough!

957
01:16:53,693 --> 01:16:58,298
Ahhh! No! Ahhh!

958
01:16:58,298 --> 01:16:59,432
Ow!

959
01:17:11,477 --> 01:17:12,544
No!

960
01:17:16,449 --> 01:17:17,516
A waitress?

961
01:17:20,920 --> 01:17:26,291
You don't ever give me credit for any...
Any finer feelings, do you?

962
01:17:26,291 --> 01:17:29,727
Oh, Mother,
cut the penny dreadful dramatics.

963
01:17:29,727 --> 01:17:30,895
You're working in a...

964
01:17:33,365 --> 01:17:34,432
In Hollywood.

965
01:17:37,135 --> 01:17:39,069
It's fine.
I'll try not to think about it.

966
01:17:41,873 --> 01:17:42,940
The truth is...

967
01:17:45,977 --> 01:17:48,278
I've felt exactly
the same as you.

968
01:17:51,982 --> 01:17:55,417
And I never would have taken the job
to begin with if it hadn't been that I...

969
01:18:00,590 --> 01:18:03,259
That I've decided to
open a place of my own.

970
01:18:06,529 --> 01:18:08,263
And had to learn the business

971
01:18:10,166 --> 01:18:12,100
from the ground up.

972
01:18:12,100 --> 01:18:13,735
That's the reason I took
the job in the first place.

973
01:18:13,735 --> 01:18:16,037
What do you...
What do you mean, a place of your own?

974
01:18:19,075 --> 01:18:21,076
A restaurant, of course.

975
01:18:22,778 --> 01:18:25,279
There's money in a restaurant,
if you run it right.

976
01:18:26,748 --> 01:18:28,349
You know how to
run a restaurant?

977
01:18:28,349 --> 01:18:32,719
Well, yes. Well...
I'm learning. I'm learning how.

978
01:18:37,259 --> 01:18:38,359
What kind of restaurant?

979
01:18:41,728 --> 01:18:43,062
I don't know, exactly.

980
01:18:45,366 --> 01:18:49,735
But something nice.
Something we can be proud of.

981
01:18:51,372 --> 01:18:52,438
A fine restaurant?

982
01:18:54,275 --> 01:18:56,474
Well, yes, of course.

983
01:18:57,510 --> 01:18:58,576
As fine as it could be.

984
01:19:02,048 --> 01:19:03,115
Oh, Mother.

985
01:19:04,650 --> 01:19:07,219
Mother, forgive me for
being so wretched before.

986
01:19:08,487 --> 01:19:10,355
I'm sorry I acted so horribly.

987
01:19:12,557 --> 01:19:17,995
I think, it's just wonderful, just wonderful,
what you're planning. Truly I do.

988
01:19:19,298 --> 01:19:21,865
I know, dear.

989
01:19:21,865 --> 01:19:26,270
And I know you'll do wonderfully well.
I'm certain of it.

990
01:19:32,176 --> 01:19:33,243
Oh, Veda.

991
01:19:35,413 --> 01:19:37,213
What is it, Mother?

992
01:19:38,382 --> 01:19:39,449
Nothing, dear.

993
01:19:41,052 --> 01:19:43,519
It's just that you were right
and I was wrong.

994
01:19:45,455 --> 01:19:49,891
No matter what I say,
no matter what anybody says,

995
01:19:49,891 --> 01:19:51,260
never give that up,

996
01:19:52,662 --> 01:19:55,197
that way you have
of looking at things.

997
01:19:57,500 --> 01:20:01,302
I can't help it, Mother.
It's how I feel.

998
01:20:04,706 --> 01:20:06,707
I know it is.

999
01:20:09,945 --> 01:20:13,114
And from now on,

1000
01:20:13,114 --> 01:20:16,916
things are going to get better for us.
I'm certain they will.

1001
01:20:18,353 --> 01:20:20,887
So we'll have what we want.

1002
01:20:20,887 --> 01:20:24,824
Maybe we won't be rich,
but we'll have something.

1003
01:20:26,160 --> 01:20:27,760
And it'll all be on
account of you.

1004
01:20:30,498 --> 01:20:33,332
I love you, Mother.
Truly I do.

1005
01:20:36,336 --> 01:20:39,405
Every good thing that
happens is on account of you.

1006
01:20:41,008 --> 01:20:43,509
If Mother only had
sense enough to know it.

1007
01:20:58,124 --> 01:21:00,291
I said hold the mayo, Archie.
You never listen.

1008
01:21:00,291 --> 01:21:03,728
Now I gotta go talk to these people.
You have no idea.

1009
01:21:03,728 --> 01:21:06,763
I'm still waiting
on those pork chops.

1010
01:21:06,763 --> 01:21:09,966
Chicken-fried steak, onions!
Baked apple with cream!

1011
01:21:09,966 --> 01:21:12,769
Meat, meat.
I need meat!

1012
01:21:12,769 --> 01:21:14,505
We changed the print
on the menus you're seeing.

1013
01:21:14,505 --> 01:21:18,042
Archie, I need two chicken cutlets.

1014
01:21:18,042 --> 01:21:20,410
Two poached eggs on toast.
Cinnamon toast. Hot chocolate.

1015
01:21:20,410 --> 01:21:22,611
Ham and eggs.
Sliced pineapple.

1016
01:22:36,316 --> 01:22:41,152
Say, Wally, you wouldn't want to
help me with something, would you?

1017
01:22:41,152 --> 01:22:43,488
Not particularly.

1018
01:22:43,488 --> 01:22:46,658
I'd have to have it soon.
Tomorrow, maybe.

1019
01:22:46,658 --> 01:22:48,126
What is it?

1020
01:22:48,126 --> 01:22:50,461
I don't know what
you'd call it, exactly.

1021
01:22:50,461 --> 01:22:54,132
An estimate of costs,
something like that.

1022
01:22:54,132 --> 01:22:56,367
For a man who
might back me in business.

1023
01:22:56,367 --> 01:22:59,837
But... But I want it all written down,
with the right words for what I mean,

1024
01:22:59,837 --> 01:23:02,840
so it looks proper, business-like.

1025
01:23:02,840 --> 01:23:05,109
What kind of business?

1026
01:23:05,109 --> 01:23:08,779
Just a little restaurant.
Something I've been thinking about...

1027
01:23:08,779 --> 01:23:12,249
Wait a minute.
Hold on. Start over.

1028
01:23:12,249 --> 01:23:14,216
At the beginning,
not in the middle.

1029
01:23:18,255 --> 01:23:22,091
Just something small,
where I could do all the cooking.

1030
01:23:22,091 --> 01:23:24,326
But a place where
all we serve is chicken.

1031
01:23:29,398 --> 01:23:31,332
Think about it.

1032
01:23:31,332 --> 01:23:33,769
They have steak places
and fish places.

1033
01:23:33,769 --> 01:23:36,504
But down where I work,
practically every other order is for chicken.

1034
01:23:36,504 --> 01:23:38,339
So a chicken place.

1035
01:23:38,339 --> 01:23:42,243
Well, looks to me as though
I'd have plenty of customers.

1036
01:23:42,243 --> 01:23:45,112
<i>And, I wouldn't have to fool
with all those a la carte prices,</i>

1037
01:23:45,112 --> 01:23:47,848
or bookkeeping, or menus,
or anything like that.

1038
01:23:49,785 --> 01:23:52,352
Everybody gets a
chicken-and-waffle dinner,

1039
01:23:52,352 --> 01:23:54,755
or chicken and vegetables,
if they like,

1040
01:23:54,755 --> 01:23:57,758
but all at the same price.

1041
01:23:57,758 --> 01:23:59,660
And then I'd have
the pies to take out,

1042
01:23:59,660 --> 01:24:02,495
and keep on getting all the
wholesale pie business that I can,

1043
01:24:02,495 --> 01:24:05,832
and well, it looks to me as though
one would help the other.

1044
01:24:05,832 --> 01:24:07,500
Who's the guy?

1045
01:24:07,500 --> 01:24:10,136
This old fogy who eats lunch with me
every day, Mr. Rand. But...

1046
01:24:11,672 --> 01:24:13,539
But I think he's got money.

1047
01:24:15,142 --> 01:24:17,342
If I can show him...

1048
01:24:17,342 --> 01:24:20,612
It could be an investment,
perhaps he'd be interested, you know, and...

1049
01:24:20,612 --> 01:24:23,348
Listen, you really think
you can put this across?

1050
01:24:23,348 --> 01:24:25,884
- Why? Don't you?
- I'm asking you.

1051
01:24:27,954 --> 01:24:30,723
Well, it seems as
though it ought to pay.

1052
01:24:30,723 --> 01:24:33,858
That's the main thing, Wally,
about this idea of mine.

1053
01:24:33,858 --> 01:24:37,394
What costs in a restaurant is waste,

1054
01:24:37,394 --> 01:24:39,630
and the extras,
like the printing for the menus,

1055
01:24:39,630 --> 01:24:44,736
and the... The people you have to have,
for the features you put in.

1056
01:24:44,736 --> 01:24:48,539
But this way,
there wouldn't be any waste.

1057
01:24:48,539 --> 01:24:51,307
I think I can put that across,
Wally, I do.

1058
01:24:52,610 --> 01:24:54,344
If you really think so, Mildred...

1059
01:24:57,148 --> 01:24:59,950
I might be able to
put you in on a deal.

1060
01:24:59,950 --> 01:25:03,887
One that would start you
off with such a bang

1061
01:25:03,887 --> 01:25:08,124
that you'd be sitting so pretty,
you wouldn't even need a backer.

1062
01:25:10,160 --> 01:25:13,562
You can't be serious.

1063
01:25:13,562 --> 01:25:17,566
Oh, I'm serious, all right.
Holy smokes, I'm serious.

1064
01:25:17,566 --> 01:25:21,636
If you don't look out, Wally, I'm...
I'm gonna cry.

1065
01:25:21,636 --> 01:25:26,941
Seemed like a good idea at the time.
It was actually Bert who thought it up.

1066
01:25:26,941 --> 01:25:30,111
Build a dream house
so we could show all the prospects

1067
01:25:30,111 --> 01:25:35,549
what their place would look like if they spent
twice as much dough as any of them had.

1068
01:25:35,549 --> 01:25:40,420
But now it's dead weight.
They gotta get rid of it.

1069
01:25:40,420 --> 01:25:43,690
And if you'll take it over with
this chicken place, then it's yours.

1070
01:25:43,690 --> 01:25:47,093
And, believe me, Mildred,
if this isn't a natural for a restaurant,

1071
01:25:47,093 --> 01:25:50,196
I never saw one. I mean,
just look at the place! Dining room...

1072
01:25:50,196 --> 01:25:54,167
Right? Come in here. Pantry.

1073
01:25:54,167 --> 01:25:59,505
Kitchen. Every stick in the place
complies with fire law, health law.

1074
01:25:59,505 --> 01:26:00,972
There's even two toilets!

1075
01:26:00,972 --> 01:26:02,974
I mean,
if you really mean business, Mildred,

1076
01:26:02,974 --> 01:26:05,977
you can have it, lock, stock, and barrel.

1077
01:26:05,977 --> 01:26:09,080
The fact is, see,
they've got to establish losses.

1078
01:26:09,080 --> 01:26:10,516
Who?

1079
01:26:10,516 --> 01:26:12,651
The receivers,
on their federal income tax,

1080
01:26:12,651 --> 01:26:17,188
due next March, the year 1931.
If they don't show losses, they're sunk.

1081
01:26:17,188 --> 01:26:18,389
But Wally...

1082
01:26:19,658 --> 01:26:21,091
I'd still have to have money!

1083
01:26:21,091 --> 01:26:22,694
Who says you would?

1084
01:26:22,694 --> 01:26:24,261
That's the beauty of it, Mildred.

1085
01:26:24,261 --> 01:26:26,864
Once you take title to a piece
of property in this town,

1086
01:26:26,864 --> 01:26:28,899
that's all anybody cares about.

1087
01:26:28,899 --> 01:26:32,202
You get all the credit you want,
more than you'll need.

1088
01:26:32,202 --> 01:26:35,004
- But why me?
- Well, who else wants it?

1089
01:26:35,004 --> 01:26:36,807
It's not a house,
it's a real estate office.

1090
01:26:36,807 --> 01:26:39,108
Last time I checked,
nobody needs one of those.

1091
01:26:39,108 --> 01:26:43,547
So, it's got to be somebody who can
use it for something else. And that's you.

1092
01:26:43,547 --> 01:26:48,984
I know, but, Wally,
I just can't believe there isn't somebody.

1093
01:26:48,984 --> 01:26:51,320
If they're just giving it away...

1094
01:26:51,320 --> 01:26:52,722
On the inside, who...

1095
01:26:52,722 --> 01:26:54,990
No, I get what you're saying.
Sure...

1096
01:26:54,990 --> 01:26:57,827
There were some original incorporators
sniffing around.

1097
01:26:57,827 --> 01:26:59,928
But they're not gonna
get past the Feds.

1098
01:26:59,928 --> 01:27:04,499
And with you, it's the "Real McCoy."
You're no insider.

1099
01:27:04,499 --> 01:27:06,968
You're no original incorporator.
You're...

1100
01:27:08,303 --> 01:27:11,105
- Oh, God damn it.
- What?

1101
01:27:12,307 --> 01:27:14,141
God damn it all to hell!
God damn it!

1102
01:27:14,141 --> 01:27:16,845
- What? What is it?
- Bert.

1103
01:27:16,845 --> 01:27:18,747
Bert? What's he got to do with it?

1104
01:27:20,214 --> 01:27:22,716
Bert's an original
incorporator.

1105
01:27:22,716 --> 01:27:24,251
Well?

1106
01:27:24,251 --> 01:27:25,786
And you're married to him.

1107
01:27:27,054 --> 01:27:29,656
And there goes your restaurant.

1108
01:27:29,656 --> 01:27:32,058
And there goes the prettiest little deal
I had a chance to put across

1109
01:27:32,058 --> 01:27:33,193
since Pierce Homes folded.

1110
01:27:48,208 --> 01:27:49,341
Unless you got a divorce.

1111
01:27:55,481 --> 01:27:57,081
Is that the only way?

1112
01:27:57,081 --> 01:27:58,450
Well he left you, didn't he?

1113
01:28:00,453 --> 01:28:03,988
Well, I'll see him.

1114
01:28:03,988 --> 01:28:07,925
Listen. Mildred, I'm telling you,
even if it wasn't for this federal thing,

1115
01:28:07,925 --> 01:28:09,760
you're gonna want to
get this cleaned up.

1116
01:28:09,760 --> 01:28:11,896
You don't know where he gets his money.
For all you can tell he...

1117
01:28:11,896 --> 01:28:14,865
I said I'd see him.

1118
01:28:14,865 --> 01:28:17,535
I probably know ten times
as much about federal taxes,

1119
01:28:17,535 --> 01:28:22,907
as Wally Burgan does, and all I can say is
it sounds to me like a lot of hooey.

1120
01:28:22,907 --> 01:28:25,708
It all comes back to a straight question
of collusion,

1121
01:28:25,708 --> 01:28:27,343
and I can prove to any
court anytime they call me...

1122
01:28:27,343 --> 01:28:31,013
Bert! Bert! It's not a question of
proving anything to a court.

1123
01:28:31,013 --> 01:28:34,216
It's whether or not they let me have
the property. If I don't get a divorce,

1124
01:28:34,216 --> 01:28:35,718
they won't let me have it.

1125
01:28:37,755 --> 01:28:40,456
I don't know what you and Wally
think you're cooking up here, but...

1126
01:28:40,456 --> 01:28:42,424
- What do you mean, me and Wally?
- It doesn't have to be that way.

1127
01:28:42,424 --> 01:28:43,926
Oh, forget it, just forget it!

1128
01:28:43,926 --> 01:28:46,094
Listen, I don't like
this anymore than you do.

1129
01:28:46,094 --> 01:28:47,228
Fine!

1130
01:28:54,838 --> 01:28:55,903
Fine.

1131
01:29:03,979 --> 01:29:06,581
What I was gonna say before
all this other business...

1132
01:29:14,489 --> 01:29:16,890
So that you and the kids
have a place to sleep at night

1133
01:29:16,890 --> 01:29:20,059
and no one can take it away from you,
is that I would give you the house.

1134
01:29:25,600 --> 01:29:28,601
- You don't have to do that.
- I want to.

1135
01:29:31,638 --> 01:29:35,173
Well, if you want to, then I accept.

1136
01:29:38,144 --> 01:29:39,712
Thank you, Bert.

1137
01:29:46,585 --> 01:29:49,754
And I'm sorry if I've said
unkind things in the past

1138
01:29:50,890 --> 01:29:52,724
about Maggie Biederhof.

1139
01:29:52,724 --> 01:29:53,858
It's all right.

1140
01:29:58,797 --> 01:30:01,632
I'm sorry I was hard on Wally just then.

1141
01:30:01,632 --> 01:30:06,503
And if there is something you feel for him,
why, that's all right, too.

1142
01:30:06,503 --> 01:30:09,439
Oh, Bert, please.

1143
01:30:09,439 --> 01:30:14,611
Christ, I knew there'd never be anything
between you and that fat slob.

1144
01:30:18,982 --> 01:30:20,049
That's all right.

1145
01:30:21,451 --> 01:30:22,518
Well...

1146
01:30:26,957 --> 01:30:32,027
I guess all we need to do now
is settle on a cause.

1147
01:30:32,027 --> 01:30:33,161
Right.

1148
01:30:36,666 --> 01:30:38,299
I guess you'll have to hit me.

1149
01:30:40,135 --> 01:30:43,572
You sound just like Veda.
She's always wanting to be hit.

1150
01:30:43,572 --> 01:30:44,940
Veda is?

1151
01:30:47,476 --> 01:30:50,044
Then I'm glad there's
a little of her in me...

1152
01:30:50,044 --> 01:30:51,178
Right...

1153
01:30:53,181 --> 01:30:56,951
The defendant hit her and caused her
great personal anguish.

1154
01:31:56,107 --> 01:31:59,209
Now he says he wants me
to have the house, too.

1155
01:31:59,209 --> 01:32:01,345
What's wrong with that?

1156
01:32:01,345 --> 01:32:02,479
I don't know.

1157
01:32:04,315 --> 01:32:06,450
I feel as though I picked his bones.

1158
01:32:06,450 --> 01:32:09,051
First the kids, then the car,

1159
01:32:10,154 --> 01:32:12,288
now the house.

1160
01:32:12,288 --> 01:32:15,491
Would you kindly tell me
what good the house would do him?

1161
01:32:15,491 --> 01:32:18,761
First call for interest,
he'd lose it flat.

1162
01:32:18,761 --> 01:32:21,030
He just looked
so damned pitiful.

1163
01:32:21,030 --> 01:32:24,566
Aw, they all do, baby.
That's what gets us.

1164
01:32:28,504 --> 01:32:32,340
All right, girls, full steam ahead!
I'm closing up the case.

1165
01:32:32,340 --> 01:32:34,976
- Do you have my print scarf?
- Check.

1166
01:32:36,712 --> 01:32:39,013
Don't forget the umbrella.

1167
01:32:39,013 --> 01:32:41,682
Suitcase, thermos,
and umbrella...

1168
01:32:41,682 --> 01:32:44,084
will all be there at Gram and Pop's
when you get home from school.

1169
01:32:44,084 --> 01:32:46,019
I just remembered!

1170
01:32:46,019 --> 01:32:48,589
Ray! Where are you going?

1171
01:32:48,589 --> 01:32:50,391
We're going to be
late for school!

1172
01:32:50,391 --> 01:32:53,194
Ray! Where'd you go?

1173
01:32:53,194 --> 01:32:55,663
I almost forgot the sand
pail Grandpa got me!

1174
01:32:55,663 --> 01:32:57,430
Hurry up, dear.
You're going to be late.

1175
01:32:59,466 --> 01:33:02,435
I'll take that.
Here are your things.

1176
01:33:02,435 --> 01:33:06,673
Now you girls have
a wonderful weekend.

1177
01:33:06,673 --> 01:33:08,808
- And mind your grandparents.
- Bye.

1178
01:33:08,808 --> 01:33:09,942
- Thanks, Mom. We will.
- Bye!

1179
01:33:09,942 --> 01:33:11,077
Bye!

1180
01:33:17,450 --> 01:33:19,484
- We've got... Morning!
- Good morning.

1181
01:33:19,484 --> 01:33:23,088
We've got fixtures going in,
painting started today.

1182
01:33:23,088 --> 01:33:24,956
Oh, come see the range!

1183
01:33:30,429 --> 01:33:33,163
Oh, now you're talking! Ha, ha!

1184
01:33:33,163 --> 01:33:35,233
It's shaping up, no?

1185
01:33:35,233 --> 01:33:38,168
Five days ago, I wasn't so sure.
But today...

1186
01:33:38,168 --> 01:33:41,171
Well, those announcements,
they ought to pull in something, too.

1187
01:33:41,171 --> 01:33:44,108
Gosh, I hope so.
What time you got, Wally?

1188
01:33:44,108 --> 01:33:46,877
- Almost 10:00.
- God, I'm gonna be late.

1189
01:33:46,877 --> 01:33:48,212
Oh, yeah? For what?

1190
01:33:48,212 --> 01:33:50,313
Last day as a working girl!

1191
01:34:08,565 --> 01:34:10,900
- Morning.
- Morning.

1192
01:34:10,900 --> 01:34:12,235
Sorry I'm late.

1193
01:34:12,235 --> 01:34:14,237
Mildred, meet Shirley,
the new girl.

1194
01:34:14,237 --> 01:34:15,371
Pleased to meet you, Shirley.

1195
01:34:15,371 --> 01:34:16,938
- Very nice to meet you.
- Thank you.

1196
01:34:18,207 --> 01:34:19,474
That's mine.

1197
01:34:19,474 --> 01:34:20,441
Would you like a refill?

1198
01:34:20,441 --> 01:34:22,710
Sit. I got it. Sit!

1199
01:34:25,047 --> 01:34:26,782
Now, when you gotta
make a customer wait...

1200
01:34:26,782 --> 01:34:28,416
- Excuse me.
- You can't just leave him sitting there...

1201
01:34:28,416 --> 01:34:29,885
Just wait one second,
I'll be right with you.

1202
01:34:29,885 --> 01:34:31,419
Like you did with
that party yesterday.

1203
01:34:33,188 --> 01:34:36,023
What the hell am I looking at this for?

1204
01:34:36,023 --> 01:34:37,825
Why does anybody ever look
at a menu for breakfast?

1205
01:34:37,825 --> 01:34:40,995
You know exactly what you're gonna have
and yet you just keep looking.

1206
01:34:40,995 --> 01:34:44,564
To check the prices, of course.

1207
01:34:44,564 --> 01:34:46,366
That's it!

1208
01:34:46,366 --> 01:34:49,068
- Okay. You ready?
- Shoot.

1209
01:34:49,068 --> 01:34:53,940
Orange juice, oatmeal, bacon and eggs,
fried on one side, but not too much.

1210
01:34:53,940 --> 01:34:58,111
Uh... Dry toast and a large coffee.
You got that?

1211
01:35:00,281 --> 01:35:04,583
Orange juice, oatmeal, bacon and eggs,
fried on one side, but not too much.

1212
01:35:04,583 --> 01:35:08,153
Uh... Dry toast and a large coffee.

1213
01:35:08,153 --> 01:35:10,088
How'd I do?

1214
01:35:10,088 --> 01:35:13,091
Very good, and if you could step on it slightly,
why, I might just get to

1215
01:35:13,091 --> 01:35:16,161
Santa Barbara in time for a little swim
before the sun goes down.

1216
01:35:16,161 --> 01:35:18,797
Gee, I wish I could
go to Santa Barbara.

1217
01:35:18,797 --> 01:35:20,732
Oh, come along.

1218
01:35:20,732 --> 01:35:22,566
You better look out.
I might say yes.

1219
01:35:30,542 --> 01:35:34,611
So I say to him, I say,
when you have a car, drive it yourself.

1220
01:35:37,748 --> 01:35:39,382
No, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

1221
01:35:39,382 --> 01:35:42,752
They... They made this thing
where you don't have to even...

1222
01:35:51,328 --> 01:35:53,095
Well? I mean it.

1223
01:35:53,095 --> 01:35:57,132
I told you to look out.
Maybe I did, too.

1224
01:35:57,132 --> 01:35:59,901
You know, what would be a
highly original thing for you to do?

1225
01:35:59,901 --> 01:36:00,969
What's that?

1226
01:36:00,969 --> 01:36:03,238
Say yes, right away.
Just like that.

1227
01:36:08,077 --> 01:36:09,377
My gosh.

1228
01:36:11,580 --> 01:36:13,647
- Shirley...
- I'm sorry.

1229
01:36:13,647 --> 01:36:15,516
It's all right,
accidents happen.

1230
01:36:15,516 --> 01:36:17,284
- I'm real sorry.
- You drop plates.

1231
01:36:17,284 --> 01:36:19,219
- You pick them up.
- I know. I didn't mean to do it.

1232
01:36:19,219 --> 01:36:20,587
- You drop yourself, you get up.
- Okay.

1233
01:36:20,587 --> 01:36:21,721
Have you recovered?

1234
01:36:21,721 --> 01:36:23,390
- Yeah. Sorry.
- Everything's good.

1235
01:36:25,559 --> 01:36:30,497
Ida, I think the real
trouble with that girl is me.

1236
01:36:30,497 --> 01:36:32,331
I think I make her nervous.

1237
01:36:33,767 --> 01:36:36,635
Would be better if
I just slipped out?

1238
01:36:36,635 --> 01:36:38,905
Well, I know he'd just
love to save the buck.

1239
01:36:38,905 --> 01:36:40,139
Of course he would.

1240
01:36:41,674 --> 01:36:43,876
All right, Mildred,
you run along.

1241
01:36:43,876 --> 01:36:46,612
Hey, no kidding, I wish you all the luck
in the world with your little place,

1242
01:36:46,612 --> 01:36:49,747
and I promise I'll be out there,
first chance I get.

1243
01:36:49,747 --> 01:36:50,916
Thanks, Ida.

1244
01:37:07,399 --> 01:37:09,800
What are you grinning about?

1245
01:37:09,800 --> 01:37:13,737
Oh... Might as well be
original once in a while.

1246
01:37:13,737 --> 01:37:16,340
Damn it, I like you.

1247
01:37:16,340 --> 01:37:19,276
Though I'd have to drop off
my car first, in Glendale,

1248
01:37:19,276 --> 01:37:22,711
- and grab a few things.
- Egads, Glendale.

1249
01:37:22,711 --> 01:37:24,613
Comes with the territory.

1250
01:37:24,613 --> 01:37:26,649
Well, we better get tapping.

1251
01:37:26,649 --> 01:37:28,418
We certainly had.

1252
01:37:37,626 --> 01:37:38,693
There we are!

1253
01:37:41,965 --> 01:37:44,732
I was beginning to think
I should contact the police.

1254
01:37:44,732 --> 01:37:46,835
Sorry to keep you.

1255
01:38:15,529 --> 01:38:16,629
You're smiling.

1256
01:38:18,866 --> 01:38:24,736
Well, I can't quite
believe I'm doing this.

1257
01:38:24,736 --> 01:38:28,207
You don't do this very often,
Mrs...?

1258
01:38:28,207 --> 01:38:31,676
Pierce. No, I should say I don't.

1259
01:38:31,676 --> 01:38:34,613
Well, I'm honored you made
an exception, Mrs. Pierce.

1260
01:38:34,613 --> 01:38:36,448
Any relation to Pierce Homes?

1261
01:38:36,448 --> 01:38:40,684
Yes, bravo.
I was married to them for a while.

1262
01:38:40,684 --> 01:38:45,689
Oh! How delightful.
Some of the worst homes ever built.

1263
01:38:45,689 --> 01:38:47,058
All the roofs leak.

1264
01:38:47,058 --> 01:38:50,661
Nothing like how the treasury leaked.

1265
01:38:51,897 --> 01:38:54,165
Well, I'm Beragon. Monty.

1266
01:38:55,634 --> 01:38:58,435
Pleased to meet you,
Monty Beragon.

1267
01:39:23,527 --> 01:39:25,562
Make yourself at home!

1268
01:39:25,562 --> 01:39:26,696
Thanks!

1269
01:39:30,867 --> 01:39:32,434
Beragon.

1270
01:39:36,338 --> 01:39:37,405
Is that French?

1271
01:39:38,507 --> 01:39:39,575
What?

1272
01:39:40,810 --> 01:39:41,877
Beragon.

1273
01:39:43,179 --> 01:39:45,980
Spanish.
Or supposed to be.

1274
01:39:45,980 --> 01:39:50,217
My great, great grandfather
was one of the original settlers.

1275
01:39:50,217 --> 01:39:54,855
You know, the gay caballeros
who gypped the Indians out of their land,

1276
01:39:54,855 --> 01:39:57,625
the king out of his taxes,
and then sold out to the yanks

1277
01:39:57,625 --> 01:39:59,894
as soon as Polk started annexing.

1278
01:40:01,963 --> 01:40:07,467
But if you ask me,
the old coot was really a wop... Bergoni.

1279
01:40:07,467 --> 01:40:09,769
Wop or spig,
doesn't make much difference, I suppose.

1280
01:40:15,109 --> 01:40:17,476
You all right in there?

1281
01:40:19,946 --> 01:40:21,013
Hello?

1282
01:40:30,590 --> 01:40:33,424
Say, there!
Not so fast, you don't!

1283
01:40:34,860 --> 01:40:36,494
Not so soon, anyway!

1284
01:40:38,530 --> 01:40:40,131
And mind the riptides!

1285
01:42:44,314 --> 01:42:50,353
So... You're 33 years old.
You live in Pasadena.

1286
01:42:50,353 --> 01:42:54,690
You went to University of
California at Los Angeles.

1287
01:42:54,690 --> 01:42:59,061
But I still don't know
what you do, Monty.

1288
01:43:00,364 --> 01:43:03,266
Oh, I don't know.
Fruit, I guess.

1289
01:43:03,266 --> 01:43:06,201
Oranges, grapefruit,
something like that.

1290
01:43:07,437 --> 01:43:09,037
So you work for the Exchange?

1291
01:43:09,037 --> 01:43:12,408
Mmm, I should say not.

1292
01:43:15,444 --> 01:43:19,981
That damned Fruit Growers' Exchange
is taking the bread right out of my mouth.

1293
01:43:19,981 --> 01:43:25,119
I hate Sunkist, and Sunmaid, and every other
label with a wholesome looking girl on it.

1294
01:43:25,119 --> 01:43:27,289
So you're an independent?

1295
01:43:27,289 --> 01:43:31,024
What difference does it make what I am?
Yes, I guess I'm an independent.

1296
01:43:33,094 --> 01:43:35,829
I have a company.
Fruit export.

1297
01:43:35,829 --> 01:43:38,332
Well, I don't have it.
I own part of it.

1298
01:43:38,332 --> 01:43:41,001
So every quarter,
they send me a check...

1299
01:43:41,001 --> 01:43:43,704
Though it's been getting a lot smaller
since this Sunkist business.

1300
01:43:47,808 --> 01:43:49,909
I don't do anything,
if that's what you mean.

1301
01:43:52,045 --> 01:43:53,546
You mean...

1302
01:43:55,081 --> 01:43:57,883
You just... loaf?

1303
01:43:59,886 --> 01:44:02,387
You can call it that, I suppose.

1304
01:44:02,387 --> 01:44:03,655
And you're content? I mean...

1305
01:44:04,757 --> 01:44:06,792
Don't you ever want to...

1306
01:44:08,494 --> 01:44:10,495
Actually do something?

1307
01:44:36,520 --> 01:44:37,687
Why should I?

1308
01:44:44,328 --> 01:44:45,048
Again?

1309
01:44:46,997 --> 01:44:48,064
Why not?

1310
01:45:29,937 --> 01:45:32,171
Oh, take the next right.

1311
01:45:32,171 --> 01:45:33,306
Here?

1312
01:45:38,044 --> 01:45:39,879
Ready?

1313
01:45:39,879 --> 01:45:41,246
Oh, I've been ready!

1314
01:45:50,489 --> 01:45:52,256
What the hell? Is this yours?

1315
01:45:52,256 --> 01:45:54,426
Tada!

1316
01:45:54,426 --> 01:45:56,728
Wait a minute. Last I heard,
you were slinging hash in that old...

1317
01:45:56,728 --> 01:45:58,463
Not anymore.

1318
01:45:58,463 --> 01:46:02,466
That was my last day yesterday,
and I quit early to run off with you.

1319
01:46:02,466 --> 01:46:05,502
From now on,
I'm a businesswoman.

1320
01:46:05,502 --> 01:46:08,305
Well, why didn't you tell me?

1321
01:46:08,305 --> 01:46:10,741
I didn't get any chance that I noticed.

1322
01:46:16,080 --> 01:46:18,448
Guess I've sort of
fallen for you, Monty.

1323
01:46:53,849 --> 01:46:54,882
Hmm...

1324
01:46:58,987 --> 01:47:00,153
So when's the big night?

1325
01:47:02,624 --> 01:47:06,192
- Two weeks Thursday. 6:00.
- Mm-hmm.

1326
01:47:08,662 --> 01:47:09,929
Am I invited?

1327
01:47:11,932 --> 01:47:14,033
Of course you are.

1328
01:47:14,033 --> 01:47:16,669
Well, I'll be there. With bells.

1329
01:47:44,530 --> 01:47:46,030
Mrs. Pierce?

1330
01:47:47,465 --> 01:47:49,967
Mrs. Floyd?
What are you are you doing out?

1331
01:47:49,967 --> 01:47:53,303
Oh, Mrs. Pierce,
where on earth have you been?

1332
01:47:53,303 --> 01:47:55,605
They've been trying to reach
you ever since last night...

1333
01:47:55,605 --> 01:47:56,973
Who... Who's been
trying to reach me?

1334
01:47:56,973 --> 01:47:58,509
It's your daughter.

1335
01:47:58,509 --> 01:48:00,477
- My daughter?
- Ray, the little one,

1336
01:48:00,477 --> 01:48:03,947
she came down with a flu
and they took her to the hospital,

1337
01:48:03,947 --> 01:48:05,749
because there was
no one at home.

1338
01:48:05,749 --> 01:48:10,553
Where? Which hospital?
Which... Which hospital?

1339
01:48:10,553 --> 01:48:13,322
Excuse me,
I'm here to see my little girl.

1340
01:48:13,322 --> 01:48:15,058
- Yes? Yes, can I help you?
- I'm Mrs. Pierce. Mildred Pierce.

1341
01:48:15,058 --> 01:48:17,126
- Mildred!
- Bert!

1342
01:48:18,962 --> 01:48:23,166
Just... Just down here.
And it's through this way.

1343
01:48:26,169 --> 01:48:28,336
She seemed fine,
temperature constant.

1344
01:48:28,336 --> 01:48:31,139
We thought she'd be
all right in a few hours.

1345
01:48:31,139 --> 01:48:32,674
Then just like that, it went up.

1346
01:48:32,674 --> 01:48:34,809
All right, just keep it down.
Bring him in here.

1347
01:48:37,380 --> 01:48:39,247
Looky.
Your mama's here.

1348
01:48:39,247 --> 01:48:41,015
Set him over there
on the other side of the bed.

1349
01:48:42,217 --> 01:48:44,118
- Mommy?
- It's Mommy, darling.

1350
01:48:46,421 --> 01:48:48,722
Your husband agreed
to the additional expense

1351
01:48:48,722 --> 01:48:52,626
after I recommended the transfusion
and we had the donor.

1352
01:48:52,626 --> 01:48:54,328
So we've gone ahead.

1353
01:48:54,328 --> 01:48:56,797
You still think it could be grippe,
Doctor?

1354
01:48:56,797 --> 01:49:00,901
Well, the fact is, we get a lot of these cases,
especially this time of year.

1355
01:49:00,901 --> 01:49:04,571
They shoot up a temperature.
They start running at the nose and...

1356
01:49:04,571 --> 01:49:07,207
The next day, they're out running around
like nothing happened.

1357
01:49:08,576 --> 01:49:10,711
What concerned me
was her temperature.

1358
01:49:10,711 --> 01:49:12,613
It's still 104, and I don't like it.

1359
01:49:12,613 --> 01:49:14,880
I don't like it,
and I don't like that thing on her lip.

1360
01:49:14,880 --> 01:49:16,381
Do you think it could get infected?

1361
01:49:16,381 --> 01:49:18,651
Well, that's the concern.

1362
01:49:18,651 --> 01:49:21,386
Now, we sent a smear of the pimple

1363
01:49:21,386 --> 01:49:24,757
over to the lab, along with
a few of CC's of blood and

1364
01:49:24,757 --> 01:49:27,392
they're on their way.
But the point is,

1365
01:49:27,392 --> 01:49:31,930
if she's got trouble,
we can't wait for any lab report.

1366
01:49:31,930 --> 01:49:34,132
She would need a
transfusion right away.

1367
01:49:37,536 --> 01:49:40,839
She was just a little
dull Friday night, just

1368
01:49:40,839 --> 01:49:42,974
seemed a little off was all.

1369
01:49:42,974 --> 01:49:47,678
And today at the beach, she seemed to be
running a temperature so...

1370
01:49:47,678 --> 01:49:51,314
We called Dr. Gale and he told us to
bring her in to the hospital.

1371
01:49:51,314 --> 01:49:53,250
He said no such thing.

1372
01:49:53,250 --> 01:49:56,987
He ordered her home
and when we got to the house,

1373
01:49:56,987 --> 01:49:59,289
it was all locked up.

1374
01:49:59,289 --> 01:50:01,991
So we rang him again,
and that is when

1375
01:50:01,991 --> 01:50:04,093
he ordered her to the hospital.

1376
01:50:04,093 --> 01:50:07,630
Because there was no
other place to take her.

1377
01:50:07,630 --> 01:50:12,234
Mother, Mother, where were you?

1378
01:50:18,474 --> 01:50:22,711
Well, her temperature's down,
pulse is down.

1379
01:50:22,711 --> 01:50:26,782
So I've probably put you to
a lot of expense over nothing.

1380
01:50:26,782 --> 01:50:28,850
That's quite all right, Doctor.

1381
01:50:28,850 --> 01:50:31,687
See, any infection above the mouth
drains into the lateral sinus,

1382
01:50:31,687 --> 01:50:33,555
and that means the brain.

1383
01:50:33,555 --> 01:50:37,692
And with that little pip on her lip,
there was no way to tell.

1384
01:50:37,692 --> 01:50:39,894
Every symptom she
had spelled grippe,

1385
01:50:39,894 --> 01:50:44,165
but just the same, all of those symptoms
could have been caused by strep, and uh,

1386
01:50:44,165 --> 01:50:46,801
if we had waited until we were sure,
it might have been too late.

1387
01:50:46,801 --> 01:50:50,804
Now, the way she's reacting to that
transfusion shows it was all a false alarm,

1388
01:50:52,006 --> 01:50:53,840
but, you never know...

1389
01:50:53,840 --> 01:50:55,641
We'll keep an eye on her.

1390
01:50:55,641 --> 01:50:58,845
But I suggest you folks
go home and get some rest.

1391
01:50:58,845 --> 01:51:02,315
- Thank you very much, Doctor.
- Thank you, Dr. Gale.

1392
01:51:04,952 --> 01:51:07,319
Bert, you take her home.
I'm going to stay.

1393
01:51:07,319 --> 01:51:09,788
You sure?
You'll call if there's any news?

1394
01:51:09,788 --> 01:51:11,190
Of course I will.

1395
01:51:14,427 --> 01:51:18,463
Don't worry, darling.
She's going to be fine.

1396
01:51:18,463 --> 01:51:21,600
Letty's waiting at home
for you, all right?

1397
01:51:23,235 --> 01:51:27,071
And then you just go to 209,

1398
01:51:28,774 --> 01:51:30,541
and that should be it.

1399
01:51:30,541 --> 01:51:32,576
I'm so tired.

1400
01:52:16,085 --> 01:52:17,152
Hurry!

1401
01:52:22,391 --> 01:52:25,293
It's serious.
The blood transfusion...

1402
01:52:26,460 --> 01:52:28,495
Hurry up!

1403
01:52:28,495 --> 01:52:31,231
- Can we get more help?
- Dr. Collins!

1404
01:52:31,231 --> 01:52:34,467
- Put it on.
- Dr. Gale.

1405
01:52:36,905 --> 01:52:38,772
- We might have to move her.
- Fever's spiking.

1406
01:52:38,772 --> 01:52:40,473
She's having a chill, Doctor.

1407
01:52:40,473 --> 01:52:42,708
- Get Dr. Collins.
- Yes, sir.

1408
01:52:42,708 --> 01:52:45,377
- She's flushed and she's been shivering...
- Dr. Gale? What...

1409
01:52:47,815 --> 01:52:48,881
More hot water bottles.

1410
01:52:52,920 --> 01:52:54,520
It's gotta be the pustule.
I know it.

1411
01:52:54,520 --> 01:52:56,255
What's happening?

1412
01:52:56,255 --> 01:52:57,690
- I need oxygen, adrenaline, and ice.
- Mildred, please step back.

1413
01:52:57,690 --> 01:53:00,025
- Her pulse is faster, Dr. Collins.
- What is it?

1414
01:53:00,025 --> 01:53:03,328
- 110.
- Her temperature's rising, Dr. Collins. It's 104.

1415
01:53:03,328 --> 01:53:06,698
Take off the hot water bottles.
Take off the blankets!

1416
01:53:06,698 --> 01:53:09,134
Her blood pressure's dropping.

1417
01:53:09,134 --> 01:53:11,803
- Get those on her now. Pulse?
- 112.

1418
01:53:13,772 --> 01:53:15,340
Her fever is spiking.

1419
01:53:15,340 --> 01:53:17,342
- Have the syringes arrived?
- Yes, Doctor, two syringes.

1420
01:53:17,342 --> 01:53:18,676
124...

1421
01:53:21,513 --> 01:53:22,547
- More ice!
- Yes, Doctor.

1422
01:53:25,684 --> 01:53:26,684
132.

1423
01:53:33,558 --> 01:53:34,624
Dr. Collins?

1424
01:53:41,366 --> 01:53:44,601
- Ray. Come on! Come on, Ray!
- There's no pulse, Dr. Collins.

1425
01:53:44,601 --> 01:53:46,802
- Ray!
- Get oxygen. Prepare for resuscitation.

1426
01:53:46,802 --> 01:53:49,938
- Ray. Come on, come on, honey. Stay with me.
- First syringe.

1427
01:53:49,938 --> 01:53:53,208
- First syringe, Doctor.
- Roll her over.

1428
01:53:53,208 --> 01:53:57,847
Come on, honey. Come on.
Come on, Ray. Ray! Come on!

1429
01:53:57,847 --> 01:54:02,150
Pulse?
Pulse? Second syringe.

1430
01:54:10,292 --> 01:54:11,526
Third syringe.

1431
01:54:19,133 --> 01:54:20,200
Pulse?

1432
01:54:24,338 --> 01:54:25,806
Fourth syringe.

1433
01:54:25,806 --> 01:54:27,056
Stop!

1434
01:55:40,143 --> 01:55:41,377
<i>Hello?</i>

1435
01:55:42,779 --> 01:55:45,646
Yes. Hello, Mrs. Biederhof?

1436
01:55:45,646 --> 01:55:47,015
<i>Yes?</i>

1437
01:55:47,015 --> 01:55:48,416
Is Bert there?

1438
01:55:49,818 --> 01:55:53,154
<i>No, he just...
Uh, is this Mrs. Pierce?</i>

1439
01:55:54,690 --> 01:55:55,756
<i>Is everything all right?</i>

1440
01:55:57,426 --> 01:55:59,827
No. I'm afraid...

1441
01:56:03,631 --> 01:56:07,034
Will you tell him that Ray died
a few minutes ago? At the hospital.

1442
01:56:07,034 --> 01:56:09,069
<i>Oh, Mrs. Pierce...</i>

1443
01:56:09,069 --> 01:56:10,804
I wanted him to
know right away.

1444
01:56:10,804 --> 01:56:12,606
<i>Yes, of course.</i>

1445
01:56:12,606 --> 01:56:14,841
<i>- Thank you.
- Of course, I'll tell him.</i>

1446
01:56:14,841 --> 01:56:18,211
<i>I'm just so sorry, Mrs. Pierce,
from the bottom of my heart, I am.</i>

1447
01:56:18,211 --> 01:56:21,080
<i>- If there's anything in the world...
- Thank you, Mrs. Biederhof...</i>

1448
01:57:57,605 --> 01:58:02,409
- Mother?
- Shhh. Shhh. Shhh...

1449
01:58:24,564 --> 01:58:27,599
Veda... Veda.

1450
01:58:29,368 --> 01:58:32,637
Oh! Oh, thank God!
