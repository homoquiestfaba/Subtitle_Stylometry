1
00:00:05,972 --> 00:00:07,640
(whooshing)

2
00:00:10,944 --> 00:00:14,214
(film reeling)

3
00:00:21,554 --> 00:00:23,890
(growling)

4
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:26,159
(yelling, bat hitting)

5
00:00:26,993 --> 00:00:28,228
- [Idaho] Three weeks ago,

6
00:00:28,228 --> 00:00:30,096
this wouldn't have
   made any sense.

7
00:00:30,096 --> 00:00:32,198
(bat clings) But so much
has happened since then.

8
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:34,534
I suppose I should've expected
 things to end this way.

9
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:36,603
(zombie growling) If we could
 just back up a few minutes.

10
00:00:36,603 --> 00:00:38,805
(zombie screeching)

11
00:00:38,805 --> 00:00:41,608
I said, if we could just
back up a few minutes.

12
00:00:41,608 --> 00:00:44,210
(reversing audio)

13
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:47,247
(cart rolling)

14
00:00:47,247 --> 00:00:48,581
That's me.

15
00:00:48,581 --> 00:00:50,517
About three minutes ago,
and about three weeks

16
00:00:50,517 --> 00:00:52,852
after the shit really went down.

17
00:00:52,852 --> 00:00:54,988
Life was simpler then.

18
00:00:54,988 --> 00:00:57,390
I mean, look how cool I look.

19
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,492
And yes, I am talking to myself.

20
00:00:59,492 --> 00:01:02,429
It helps my memory when I
   recite the rules outloud.

21
00:01:04,798 --> 00:01:06,833
You might say this
   book is my bible.

22
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:08,768
It's told me everything
I need to know.

23
00:01:08,768 --> 00:01:10,036
Like Rule #3:

24
00:01:10,036 --> 00:01:12,105
Strippers never tell the truth.

25
00:01:12,105 --> 00:01:13,506
(typewriter ding)

26
00:01:13,506 --> 00:01:15,375
- I'm Porshe, and I really
   like you. (club music)

27
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:17,343
You're different
from the others.

28
00:01:17,343 --> 00:01:20,847
- I'm Ferrari, and I'd
   like to give you something

29
00:01:20,847 --> 00:01:24,384
special in the Champagne Room.

30
00:01:24,384 --> 00:01:26,820
- I'm Mercedes, call me.

31
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,522
555-5555.

32
00:01:29,522 --> 00:01:30,990
- Sweet.

33
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:32,892
(audio fast forwards) -
[Idaho] I mean, on the surface,

34
00:01:32,892 --> 00:01:36,329
some of these rules don't
  appear to be very helpful...

35
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:39,165
But, you have to read
 between the lines.

36
00:01:39,165 --> 00:01:40,533
(club music) Like Rule #2:

37
00:01:40,533 --> 00:01:43,636
Strippers are not
 prostitutes. (typewriter ding)

38
00:01:43,636 --> 00:01:46,539
(sloshing) I can't tell
you how many people

39
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:48,875
have trouble understanding
   that simple rule.

40
00:01:49,976 --> 00:01:51,744
(door squeaking) It's
like this whole problem.

41
00:01:51,744 --> 00:01:53,213
It sounded great on paper.

42
00:01:53,213 --> 00:01:56,082
At first, it was like the
  ultimate fantasy come true.

43
00:01:56,082 --> 00:01:57,450
(cart wheels squeaking)
Rumors that the women

44
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,185
in our schools,
 offices, and churches

45
00:01:59,185 --> 00:02:02,355
were tearing their clothes
  off and dressing like sluts.

46
00:02:02,355 --> 00:02:05,024
The spectacle of the
   thing just overwhelmed us.

47
00:02:05,024 --> 00:02:06,993
The men, I mean. (muffled
   background music)

48
00:02:06,993 --> 00:02:08,761
(zombie growling) We
   wanted so hard to believe

49
00:02:08,761 --> 00:02:11,431
in something that we
  blocked out reality.

50
00:02:11,431 --> 00:02:13,032
Like Rule #6:

51
00:02:13,032 --> 00:02:15,235
No matter how much
   money you spend,

52
00:02:15,235 --> 00:02:17,537
and no matter what they say...

53
00:02:17,537 --> 00:02:19,105
(man screaming, zombie biting)

54
00:02:19,105 --> 00:02:22,375
There is NO SEX in
   the V.I.P. Room.

55
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:24,777
(multiple customers
 screaming, club music)

56
00:02:24,777 --> 00:02:28,348
(ripping) Everything
  looks so sloppy.

57
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:31,651
There was no organization,
   no resistance...

58
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:33,686
If we were to have
thought with our heads,

59
00:02:33,686 --> 00:02:35,788
instead of our dicks,
 this whole thing

60
00:02:35,788 --> 00:02:37,223
could have been avoided.

61
00:02:41,094 --> 00:02:44,197
Nobody could see what was
going on until it was too late.

62
00:02:44,197 --> 00:02:48,034
They said it was mass
hysteria. (splattering)

63
00:02:48,034 --> 00:02:51,271
I mean, did they think we
   were imagining all this?

64
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:53,506
Getting naked was great!
(package crinkling)

65
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:56,342
But we didn't know our
   moms, and sisters would be

66
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:58,711
turned into flesh-eating
fantasy sex monsters

67
00:02:58,711 --> 00:03:00,780
that would treat us like food.

68
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:04,751
(footsteps) Did you hear that?

69
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:07,487
Rule #8: Strippers love heels.

70
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:09,122
It's like a dead giveaway.

71
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:13,359
It also makes them very slow.

72
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:20,099
(zombies growling)

73
00:03:25,471 --> 00:03:27,173
(yelling)

74
00:03:27,173 --> 00:03:29,042
(bags crinkling)

75
00:03:35,448 --> 00:03:37,784
(heavy rock)

76
00:03:37,784 --> 00:03:39,652
(bags slam against wall)

77
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,821
(Idaho screams)

78
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:44,123
(bottles clinging)

79
00:03:44,123 --> 00:03:47,860
(zombie oofs) Rule #12:
   Always bring your A Game.

80
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:50,196
(bat unsheathing) Strippers
  get hit on constantly.

81
00:03:50,196 --> 00:03:53,132
(yelling, bat hits) If you
   try to hit on strippers,

82
00:03:53,132 --> 00:03:56,836
and don't bring your A Game,
  they will eat you alive.

83
00:03:56,836 --> 00:04:00,006
(Idaho hits the ground)
   Welcome, to Stripperland.

84
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:01,774
("Stripperland"
   by Western Aerial)

85
00:04:01,774 --> 00:04:03,676
(zombie screeching)

86
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:22,895
(police siren)

87
00:04:29,636 --> 00:04:30,637
(zombie groans)

88
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:37,877
(zombies growling)

89
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:44,417

90
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:50,857
(zombie growling)

91
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,435
(zombie growling)

92
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:17,417
(party horn)

93
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:18,885
(bone cracking)

94
00:05:29,295 --> 00:05:33,332
(zombies screeching, growling)

95
00:05:36,202 --> 00:05:38,504
(Hummer pulling up)

96
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:44,544
(gun cocking)

97
00:05:45,378 --> 00:05:47,780
- [Frisco] I didn't bring
   any dollar bills, bitches.

98
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:50,950
I guess this dance is gonna
  have to be on the house.

99
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:55,054
(shotgun blasts)

100
00:05:55,054 --> 00:05:59,192
(Idaho grunting,
   zombies growling)

101
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:02,462
- Hey! Help, a little help here.

102
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:04,664
(zombie groaning, gunshot)

103
00:06:08,234 --> 00:06:11,037
(Idaho grunting)

104
00:06:13,106 --> 00:06:15,308
Holy crap, you sure
  showed up in time.

105
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:16,642
I thought I was a goner.

106
00:06:16,642 --> 00:06:18,010
Thank you, thank you, thank you,

107
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:19,112
thank you, thank you.

108
00:06:19,112 --> 00:06:21,080
(running)

109
00:06:24,917 --> 00:06:27,253
Hey! I think we should
probably get outta here.

110
00:06:27,253 --> 00:06:28,888
I think there are more coming.

111
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:30,556
Did you hear me?

112
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:32,625
- Yeah.
  - [Idaho] (running) Then...

113
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:34,694
What are you doing?

114
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:36,796
- Shoppin'.

115
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:41,300
(soft background
  music) Can you bake?

116
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:45,238
I said, can you bake?

117
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:47,940
(smoke detector beeping)

118
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:50,143
- [Woman] Hey, what's burning?

119
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:51,410
- Kinda.

120
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:56,516
- Crap. (box hits the floor)

121
00:06:56,516 --> 00:06:58,184
Crap. (other box hits)

122
00:06:58,184 --> 00:06:59,619
Complete crap. (third box hits)

123
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:03,689
(hitting boxes) All these
premade mixes are complete shit.

124
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:05,691
Man I need something...
(hitting boxes)

125
00:07:05,691 --> 00:07:07,059
From scratch.

126
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:08,528
None of this premade bullshit.

127
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:12,598
Everywhere I go, no eggs,
   bad milk, and only flour.

128
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:15,635
Fuckin' doo.

129
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:18,404
(Idaho hits shelf)

130
00:07:18,404 --> 00:07:20,373
(mumbling) Nobody can cook.

131
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:22,842
(continues mumbling)

132
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:27,814
(Hummer accelerates)

133
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:53,673
You look pathetic, get in.

134
00:07:53,673 --> 00:07:56,042
(heavy metal)

135
00:08:30,476 --> 00:08:32,245
(radio static)

136
00:08:33,579 --> 00:08:37,149
- So, not from around here.
  - Mm.

137
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:39,719
- Back east, down south?

138
00:08:43,522 --> 00:08:44,824
- San Francisco.

139
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:46,826
- Oh, nice!

140
00:08:46,826 --> 00:08:48,127
I was there once.

141
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:50,129
My parents took me, nice place.

142
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:51,697
Bridge, Alcatraz...

143
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:54,033
It's amazing anybody
ever escaped from there.

144
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:55,301
Sharks!

145
00:08:56,168 --> 00:08:57,937
By the way, I'm-
  - Look, I don't have any use

146
00:08:57,937 --> 00:08:59,138
for any names...

147
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:02,541
In this mess you either
are are you aren't.

148
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:04,577
And chances are we
   won't be for long.

149
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:08,314
- Okay, well, what should
   we call each other?

150
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:10,816
- You're Idaho.

151
00:09:10,816 --> 00:09:12,018
- Huh?

152
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:14,620
Oh, like that movie!

153
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:17,723
We call each other by
  where we came from? Cool...

154
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:21,661
So you're San Fran, no, Frisco.

155
00:09:21,661 --> 00:09:23,529
Yeah, Frisco...

156
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:26,399
But I need a different name.
  - You're Idaho.

157
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,401
- Well, yeah, but
   I'm not even from-

158
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:30,836
- Idaho!

159
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:37,576
(Hummer accelerating)

160
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:51,257
- [Idaho] You don't
  talk much, do you?

161
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:53,893
- Nope.

162
00:09:56,662 --> 00:09:58,931
- Would you like to
  know more about me?

163
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:07,039
What else is there
   to talk about?

164
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:09,041
(punching, splattering)

165
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:10,743
(Frisco sighs)

166
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,447
You wouldn't believe this but,

167
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,549
I lived with my dad and stepmom.

168
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:18,117
They left me pretty much alone.

169
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:19,218
(punk rock playing
 through the computer)

170
00:10:19,218 --> 00:10:20,186
(messenger beeps)

171
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:27,293
(typing, messenger beeping)

172
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:39,839
(clicking, typing)

173
00:10:47,747 --> 00:10:49,448
(clicking, scoffing)

174
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:58,557
(clicking, zombie growling)

175

(Dad yelling, glass
  breaking in the background)

177

(clicking)

178
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:19,612
- This is Susie Borman,
coming to you live.

179
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,715
Women are returning in

Widespread reports from
malls and churches,

182
00:11:27,286 --> 00:11:29,755
and office buildings
  report that women

183
00:11:29,755 --> 00:11:32,491
are inexplicably tearing
off their clothes,

184
00:11:32,491 --> 00:11:34,927
and seeking screaming
 acts of murder.

185
00:11:35,694 --> 00:11:38,397
Officials are urging
  citizens, men particularly,

186
00:11:38,397 --> 00:11:42,201
stay indoors, and avoid all
  women in a state of undress.

187
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:44,170
It may seem that they
 have desire for sex,

188
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:46,505
but really they just want to
  eat you. (messenger beeps)

189
00:11:46,505 --> 00:11:49,308
I see terrible
 things, stay indoors!

190
00:11:49,308 --> 00:11:53,646
Oh, my God! (zombies groaning)

191
00:11:56,949 --> 00:11:58,718

210

211
00:13:25,237 --> 00:13:26,372
- Dad, what happened?

212
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:27,806
We have to get
   you to a hospital.

213
00:13:27,806 --> 00:13:30,242
- (grunting) Ah,
c'mon, it's not so bad.

214
00:13:30,242 --> 00:13:32,144
- Dad, what did she do to you?

215
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:34,847
- It's not her fault,
 she's a good woman.

216
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:38,417
It's the virus, a
   jerk of a virus.

217
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:41,053
It's taken over.
   (Barbara growling)

218
00:13:41,053 --> 00:13:45,357
Look, son, I know I haven't
  been there for you always.

219
00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:47,326
I haven't lead a great life.

220
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:49,628
I know I missed
   your soccer games,

221
00:13:49,628 --> 00:13:53,065
and school plays,
   and you enjoyed

222
00:13:53,065 --> 00:13:55,301

  and that's why

223
00:13:55,301 --> 00:13:58,971

  but (grunting and mumbling).

224

(panting, Barbara growling)

226
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,481
I was trying to
   make a good life.

227
00:14:09,481 --> 00:14:14,153
A life for you and Barbara, me.

228
00:14:14,153 --> 00:14:16,355
I got all those strip
clubs, put 'em together,

229
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:19,325
we almost went public,
 it was for you!

230
00:14:19,325 --> 00:14:21,360
And I had to get you a Beemer...

231
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,763

   Wingman. (typewriter ding)

You help him, and
   he will help you.

262
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,932
So, I'll be your Wingman.

   - Look!

Idaho, I'm sorry.

270
00:16:26,251 --> 00:16:29,421
- It's cool, I just thought
  since we're survivors,

271
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:31,623
we'd have to stick together,
  but I understand how-

272
00:16:31,623 --> 00:16:33,992
- No, I'm sorry.

That's the plan.

477

478
00:25:22,921 --> 00:25:24,356
Or brownies.

479
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:25,790
Fuck, I'd even settle for
   a cupcake at this point.

480
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:28,960
What about fruit
   pies, or Twinkies?

481
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,896
- What?
  - Twinkies.

482
00:25:30,896 --> 00:25:32,364

484
00:25:33,832 --> 00:25:35,934
Every corner mart's got

No, son, I'm talkin' about
   fresh, baked sunshine.

A crispy, satin-y,

00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:52,717

490

492
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:04,262

   always knew I would learn,

493
00:26:04,262 --> 00:26:07,299
if Ash could be
   here to teach me.

494
00:26:07,299 --> 00:26:10,268
- But you asked me if
 I knew how to bake.

495
00:26:10,268 --> 00:26:12,070
- [Frisco] You
   know, sometimes...

496
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:15,607
In my sleep, I can
   smell the cookies.

497
00:26:15,607 --> 00:26:18,977
I wake up, and it
   just disappears.

498
00:26:19,811 --> 00:26:21,479
I could be driving and
 I swear I could smell

499
00:26:21,479 --> 00:26:25,050
fresh, baked apple
  pie in the distance.

500
00:26:26,718 --> 00:26:29,087
(sighing) Sometimes it's
the only thing that-

501
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:30,288
- What?

502
00:26:30,288 --> 00:26:33,325
What?
   - Nothin'.

503
00:26:33,325 --> 00:26:35,460
Why don't you just
   go to a bakery?

504
00:26:36,728 --> 00:26:38,229
- Fuck you.
  - What?

505
00:26:38,229 --> 00:26:39,597
That seems like the
  logical thing to do.

506
00:26:39,597 --> 00:26:40,765
You want a cupcake?

507
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:41,900
Go to a bakery.

508
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,435
- Oh, why didn't
I think of that?

509
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:45,870
Oh, I know, because I'm
  not some stupid fuckin' kid

00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:47,605

511
00:26:47,605 --> 00:26:50,742
he's the first person

512
00:26:50,742 --> 00:26:52,077
- Hurtful...

513
00:26:52,077 --> 00:26:53,445
Words hurt.

514
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:54,746

520
00:27:06,858 --> 00:27:08,493
This is no Sunday school
picnic. (cocks gun)

521
00:27:08,493 --> 00:27:09,461
- No!
   - [Idaho] Wait, they don't

522
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:10,595
look like strippers!
  - No!

523
00:27:10,595 --> 00:27:11,796
- [Frisco] Are you a stripper?

524
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:12,831
- [Virginia] No, I could
never be a stripper.

525
00:27:12,831 --> 00:27:14,299
Besides, I can't dance for shit.

526
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:15,967
- [Frisco] Maybe I should
   kill you just to be sure!

527
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:17,135
- Dude, she said
she can't dance.

528
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:18,603
That means she's not a stripper.

529
00:27:18,603 --> 00:27:20,338
- [Frisco] So they say, but
they did try to steal my truck.

530
00:27:20,338 --> 00:27:22,374
- Listen cowboy, relax.
- How do I know they're

531
00:27:22,374 --> 00:27:23,708
not gonna turn into
  one of those things?

532
00:27:23,708 --> 00:27:26,211
- [West] We're okay,
  we're not infected!

533
00:27:26,211 --> 00:27:27,979
We're sorry, we didn't
know we could trust you.

534
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:29,748
- [Frisco] Oh, so I can
trust you bitches now?

535
00:27:29,748 --> 00:27:30,882
Last time I saw a woman like you

536
00:27:30,882 --> 00:27:32,183
she was eating a man's brain.

537
00:27:32,183 --> 00:27:33,284
- That shouldn't
have taken long.

538
00:27:33,284 --> 00:27:34,686
- [Idaho] Oh, snap.

539
00:27:34,686 --> 00:27:36,388
- [West] Look, we're not
cannibal strippers, cocksucker.

540
00:27:36,388 --> 00:27:38,123
We broke down and we're
   trying to get outta here.

541
00:27:38,123 --> 00:27:39,891
- We're lost, and we
  just wanna get home.

542
00:27:39,891 --> 00:27:41,059
- Yeah, where's that?

543
00:27:41,059 --> 00:27:43,228
- Oregon, Portland
   near the coast.

544
00:27:43,228 --> 00:27:46,031
- Oregon? Nobody's
trying to get to Oregon.

545
00:27:46,031 --> 00:27:47,399
Everyone's trying to
  get out of Oregon.

546
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:48,933
- Ore-"gone," really?

547
00:27:48,933 --> 00:27:50,835
- You of all people
   should know, stripper boy,

548
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:52,637
you gotta go through
 Portland to get to the coast.

549
00:27:52,637 --> 00:27:54,005
And Portland had more
 strippers per capita

550
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:56,107
than any other city
 in the United States.

551
00:27:56,107 --> 00:27:58,043
It was full of strippers
before the outbreak.

552
00:27:58,043 --> 00:28:00,045
- Well maybe it's not anymore.

553
00:28:00,045 --> 00:28:01,346
- No it's worse.

554
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:03,114
Everything's a strip club now.

555
00:28:03,114 --> 00:28:04,949
They got this place
 called Stripper Alley.

556
00:28:04,949 --> 00:28:06,518
It's Ground fuckin' Zero.

557
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:08,453
- Please, we just
   wanna get home.

558
00:28:08,453 --> 00:28:10,588
- [Frisco] No, I'm not
 goin', no matter what.

559
00:28:10,588 --> 00:28:13,124
It's like trying to go bear
  hunting with a leatherman.

560
00:28:13,124 --> 00:28:15,326
- (crying) Please!

561
00:28:17,829 --> 00:28:19,964
- We're trying to get
   there to see our Grandbo.

562
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:22,834
- So wait, your what?

563
00:28:22,834 --> 00:28:25,670
- [West] Our grandma,
 we call her Grandbo.

564
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:27,072
- What kinda name is that?

565
00:28:27,072 --> 00:28:28,740
- [West] Fuck these losers,
  we'll find another way.

566
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:31,609
- N-n-n-no, it's just kind
   of a weird name, is all.

567
00:28:31,609 --> 00:28:33,545
- It'll be a lot
 stranger when she puts

568
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:35,113
her size 10 shoe up her ass.

569
00:28:35,113 --> 00:28:37,215
- Whoa, I didn't mean
 anything by it, I-

570
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:38,750
- Stupid and naïve.

571
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:41,219
Your Gumby's probably
 infected and'll stick

572
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:43,455
her wrinkled clam in your
   face if you get too close.

573
00:28:43,455 --> 00:28:46,057
- Grandbo.
- [Frisco] Gumby, Gumbo,

574
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:48,193
whatever, is she some
   kind of ancient army bag.

575
00:28:48,193 --> 00:28:50,295
- [West] Yes she is, and she's
 a lot of other things, too.

576
00:28:50,295 --> 00:28:53,364
- Yeah, a bowler, a lodge
 president, a champion baker...

577
00:28:53,364 --> 00:28:55,066
- [West] And our grandmother,
 so we're going to

578
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:56,267
go see her one way or another.

579
00:28:56,267 --> 00:28:57,035
- [Frisco] Wait, what?

580
00:28:57,035 --> 00:28:58,503
- [West] Fuck off.

581
00:28:58,503 --> 00:29:00,972
- No, look, I'm sorry, this
whole thing has just gotten me-

582
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:03,575
Did you say champion baker?

583
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:05,677
- [Virginia] Yeah, she's
the best in the west.

584
00:29:05,677 --> 00:29:07,612
Ten times in 20 years.

585
00:29:07,612 --> 00:29:09,013
- She bakes.

586
00:29:09,013 --> 00:29:10,615
- [West] She also
 kicks ass at Scrabble.

587
00:29:10,615 --> 00:29:11,816
Fuck you.

588
00:29:13,218 --> 00:29:14,719
- [Virginia] Why
   does that matter?

589
00:29:14,719 --> 00:29:16,354
- [Idaho] He has a
 thing for baked goods.

590
00:29:16,354 --> 00:29:17,622
I dunno.

591
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:19,657
Dude, let's help them.

592
00:29:20,625 --> 00:29:22,494
Dude, why are you
  being so difficult.

593
00:29:22,494 --> 00:29:24,729
They're uninfected girls.

594
00:29:24,729 --> 00:29:27,765
Uninfected girls!

595
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,034
Don't fuck this up for me, man.

596
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:34,973
Okay, just think of
those hot, moist cookies

597
00:29:34,973 --> 00:29:36,207
coming out of the oven.

598
00:29:37,742 --> 00:29:40,411
If their Gumby is
   a champion baker-

599
00:29:40,411 --> 00:29:41,779
- [Virginia] If
   you get us there,

600
00:29:41,779 --> 00:29:43,548
I'll make sure you get so much-

601
00:29:43,548 --> 00:29:45,016
- What?

602
00:29:45,016 --> 00:29:47,819
- Well, more, cookies,
 pies, and cakes

603
00:29:47,819 --> 00:29:49,420
than you can even imagine.

604
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:52,090
- [Frisco] I don't know,
I can imagine a lot.

605
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:53,525
- [Virginia] Well,
  if you get us there

606
00:29:53,525 --> 00:29:55,727
in one piece, you get it all.

607
00:29:55,727 --> 00:29:57,095
- I better.

608
00:29:57,095 --> 00:29:58,463
- You will.

609
00:30:01,199 --> 00:30:03,935
(rock music)

610
00:30:10,608 --> 00:30:12,710
(engine starts)

611
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:17,615
(Hummer accelerates)

612
00:30:30,828 --> 00:30:32,764
- [Idaho] So...

613
00:30:32,764 --> 00:30:35,033
So what have you two
 been doing to survive?

614
00:30:35,033 --> 00:30:37,635
- Whatever we can.
   - Oh, good God.

615
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:40,605
- So, what are your names?

616
00:30:40,605 --> 00:30:42,240
- Well he's Frisco.

617
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,408
We have this thing
   where we're named

618
00:30:43,408 --> 00:30:45,009
after the state
  where we come from.

619
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:48,012
- What state is Frisco,
shouldn't he be Cali?

620
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,882
- And I'm Idaho.

621
00:30:50,882 --> 00:30:52,483
- Potatoes, new turf.

622
00:30:52,483 --> 00:30:53,785
- Oh, I'm not really from...

623
00:30:55,286 --> 00:30:57,121
So, where are you from?

624
00:30:57,121 --> 00:30:59,257
- [West] Virginia, we're
both from Virginia.

625
00:30:59,257 --> 00:31:01,259
- So much for your name game.

626
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:03,428
- She's Virginia and
  then you're West.

627
00:31:03,428 --> 00:31:05,063
- What?
   - [Frisco] Shut up, West.

628
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,999
(Hummer passing)

629
00:31:10,935 --> 00:31:13,104
- Soo, this is
   pretty weird, huh?

630
00:31:14,239 --> 00:31:17,809
It's like a Greek
   tragedy, you know?

631
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:18,843
I mean, think about it.

632
00:31:18,843 --> 00:31:21,379
A world full of strippers.

633
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:22,880
That's like every man's fantasy:

634
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,216
a bunch of hot
  chicks in lingerie.

635
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:26,384
I mean, I've talked
  to a lot of guys

636
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:28,186
who would've thought
  this was perfect.

637
00:31:28,186 --> 00:31:31,322
But instead of having
   sex, they want to eat us.

638
00:31:31,322 --> 00:31:33,691
It's like, a "be careful
   what you wish for" thing,

639
00:31:33,691 --> 00:31:35,193
like a myth or a fable.

640
00:31:35,193 --> 00:31:38,563
It's a perversion of our
perversions, you know?

641
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:40,231
I mean, men see
  women in a certain-

642
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:41,466
(heavy rock)

643
00:31:41,466 --> 00:31:44,202
(blade swipes, Idaho gargling)

644
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:47,038
...perversion of our
 perversions, you know?

645
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:50,074
I mean men see woman
 in a certain way
 (Hummer accelerating).

646
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:53,578
I guess I'm kind of like,
   a lesbian, because we both

647
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:56,381
like the same kinds of things,
 or maybe I'm kind of like-

648
00:31:56,381 --> 00:31:57,982
- [Virginia] We should
 go to that mall.

649
00:31:57,982 --> 00:31:58,950
- [Frisco] Why would
  anyone wanna go

650
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:00,752
to a mall at a time like this?

651
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:02,687
Those things love the mall.

652
00:32:02,687 --> 00:32:04,088
The mall's the worst
  place you can go.

653
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:05,290
- [West] It would
   be hard to secure,

654
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:06,858
but there might be
 some advantages to it.

655
00:32:06,858 --> 00:32:08,760
It's also a target;
  those things love

656
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,062
Hot Topic and Victoria's Secret.

657
00:32:11,062 --> 00:32:13,131
- I was just thinking
we could get some stuff,

658
00:32:13,131 --> 00:32:15,700
like clothes, or-
 - It's too dangerous.

659
00:32:19,537 --> 00:32:21,472
- (groaning) Well, maybe we
  could get something to eat.

660
00:32:21,472 --> 00:32:23,608
You know, if they
   have a food court,

661
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:25,276
maybe we could
   get some, I dunno,

662
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:26,511
elephant ears, or something.

663
00:32:26,511 --> 00:32:28,980
We've been driving all night.

664
00:32:32,383 --> 00:32:35,019
(techno music)

665
00:32:52,537 --> 00:32:54,605
(zombies groaning)

666
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:02,213
- [West] I think it'd be
safer to go around back.

667
00:33:02,213 --> 00:33:04,582
- Agreed. I prefer rear entry.

668
00:33:17,595 --> 00:33:18,963
It looks locked.

669
00:33:18,963 --> 00:33:20,164
Even if this was a good idea,

670
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:23,167
and I don't think it
  is, we can't get in.

671
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:25,370
- [West] I can
   get us in, cowboy.

672
00:33:27,638 --> 00:33:29,407
(door closing)

673
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:34,912
- [Idaho] (whistles
  once) Sweet ride.

674
00:33:34,912 --> 00:33:36,381
It needs a wash though.

675
00:33:39,317 --> 00:33:41,786
(lock picking)

676
00:33:43,554 --> 00:33:45,890
(alarm blares once)

677
00:33:47,125 --> 00:33:49,327
- Something I
  picked up in Israel.

678
00:33:49,327 --> 00:33:51,095
- [Frisco] Well,
  you're smarter than

679
00:33:51,095 --> 00:33:52,563
ya look, aren't ya, cookie?

680
00:33:52,563 --> 00:33:54,065
- Why thank you!

681
00:33:54,065 --> 00:33:56,601
And I'm not your
cookie fucktard.

682
00:33:56,601 --> 00:33:57,702
(gun cocking)

683
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:13,284
(door shuts)

684
00:34:15,186 --> 00:34:19,190
(zombies groaning, footsteps)

685
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:30,234
(running)

686
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:32,203
Sure you can handle
  that, cupcake?

687
00:34:32,203 --> 00:34:34,172
- Yeah, I think I'll be alright.

688
00:34:34,172 --> 00:34:36,441
It's Rule#12: Always
  bring your A Game,

689
00:34:36,441 --> 00:34:40,211
because strippers get
 hit on constantly.

690
00:34:40,211 --> 00:34:42,847
And you're not even
  listening to me.

691
00:34:42,847 --> 00:34:45,183
(footsteps)

692
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:55,293
(soft background music)

693
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:09,207
(footsteps)

694
00:35:13,544 --> 00:35:15,713
- [Frisco] This place is
 huge, I'm gonna check it out.

695
00:35:15,713 --> 00:35:18,749
- We should stay together.
   - They need to stay here,

696
00:35:18,749 --> 00:35:21,085
and you need to stay with them.

697
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:27,458
(footsteps, zombies groaning)

698
00:35:33,164 --> 00:35:36,400
(soft background music)

699
00:35:41,906 --> 00:35:45,843
- [Idaho] So, why did you guys
 try to steal Frisco's truck?

700
00:35:45,843 --> 00:35:48,079
- [West] Because I don't
   know how to hotwire a car.

701
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:49,180
- [Virginia] We tried,
 but they make it

702
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:50,681
look so easy in the video games.

703
00:35:50,681 --> 00:35:52,149
- [Idaho] Yeah, Grand Theft
  Auto, all you have to do

704
00:35:52,149 --> 00:35:53,851
is (mumbling, West coughs).

705
00:35:59,257 --> 00:36:01,993
So, anyway what I was
  saying earlier, in the car,

706
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:03,761
I'm not trying to
   be a macho jerk,

707
00:36:03,761 --> 00:36:06,631
it really is like
   a Greek tragedy.

708
00:36:06,631 --> 00:36:10,067
The Bocki were these women,
  who would tear men apart.

709
00:36:10,067 --> 00:36:12,103
They would get all horny-
  - Why can't you be more like

710
00:36:12,103 --> 00:36:15,673
your friend, he takes care of
 business and shuts his yap.

711
00:36:16,641 --> 00:36:17,909
- [Virginia] Why do you
call them strippers?

712
00:36:17,909 --> 00:36:19,677
They're not strippers,
 they're monsters.

713
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:22,580
(zombies groaning)

714
00:36:26,083 --> 00:36:28,152
- [Idaho] They are
   compelled to dance

715
00:36:28,152 --> 00:36:31,022
provocatively and
   dress in lingerie.

716
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:32,290
I mean, the virus hits and they

717
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:35,159
start looking for
   thongs and heels.

718
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:37,628
I mean, it makes sense but
  I'm not sure who started it.

719
00:36:37,628 --> 00:36:40,097
- Shitballs like you
  started the name.

720
00:36:40,097 --> 00:36:42,400
But I heard the military
started the problem.

721
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,701
See, they were
   experimenting with

722
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:45,336
some behavior-altering
 chemicals.

723
00:36:45,336 --> 00:36:47,538
They just thought they could
 dump it and it would go away.

724
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:48,773
- [Soldier] Oh, crap!
 (liquid pouring out)

725
00:36:48,773 --> 00:36:50,308
- [West] But something happened.

726
00:36:50,308 --> 00:36:53,010
Soaked into the water
 supply. (burning)

727
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:55,646
- Huh, that's not
  what I heard at all.

728
00:36:55,646 --> 00:36:57,782
I heard (sneezing) it
started in a strip club.

729
00:36:57,782 --> 00:37:00,218
Yeah, it was a mutation
of Mad Cow's Disease,

730
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:02,787
caused by a mixture of
 germs and chemicals.

731
00:37:02,787 --> 00:37:06,557
(dubstep music) Rule #11:
   Never eat at a strip club.

732
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:08,192
(crunching, typewriter dings)

733
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,695
- What's with the rules?

734
00:37:10,695 --> 00:37:13,397
- Well, I,
  - Rule #55: You're an idiot.

735
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:15,132
(typewriter ding) - [Virginia]
 I don't think anyone knows

736
00:37:15,132 --> 00:37:16,968
how it actually
  started, but i think

737
00:37:16,968 --> 00:37:18,536
it was spread through the money.

738
00:37:18,536 --> 00:37:21,372
Paper money isn't actually
   paper, it's partly cotton,

739
00:37:21,372 --> 00:37:24,642
and there's a lot of
 germs in it- (tapping)

740
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:29,747
What do we do? Where's
 it coming from?

741
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:31,382
- I'm ready.
 (unsheathing machete)

742
00:37:31,382 --> 00:37:36,387
- One, that's no stripper,
   unless she has three legs.

743
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:43,327
(microphone feedback)
 - [Intercom voice]
 Food, army, money?

744
00:37:43,327 --> 00:37:45,029
No.

745
00:37:45,029 --> 00:37:47,431
When there's no
   room on the pole,

746
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:49,767
the strippers will
   walk the earth.

747
00:37:50,701 --> 00:37:52,970
- [West] What? Who are you?

748
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:56,007
(tapping)

749
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:04,081
- I came from Indianapolis.

750
00:38:04,081 --> 00:38:07,518
I lost 100 that first
 night. (tapping)

751
00:38:07,518 --> 00:38:09,887
In the morning we
  formed tight groups.

752
00:38:09,887 --> 00:38:14,158
Then we'd hit at them, sometimes
the stripper'd go away.

753
00:38:14,158 --> 00:38:16,627
And sometimes she wouldn't.

754
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:19,597
You know, the thing about
   a stripper is she's got

755
00:38:19,597 --> 00:38:24,468
painted eyes, black
eyes, like a doll's eye.

756
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:27,672
And when they come at you,
 they don't seem to be living.

757
00:38:27,672 --> 00:38:29,640
Then they rip you to pieces.

758
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:34,345
- Who's the pimp?

759
00:38:34,345 --> 00:38:37,014
(Maestro laughing)

760
00:38:37,014 --> 00:38:39,884
(electronic music)

761
00:38:39,884 --> 00:38:40,985
- Mmm.

762
00:38:43,054 --> 00:38:46,357
(footsteps, zombies groaning)

763
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:56,634
- [Frisco] But why a
  mall, of all places?

764
00:38:56,634 --> 00:38:58,636
- [Maestro] Well I used to
 troll these malls for bitches,

765
00:38:58,636 --> 00:39:00,171
and then I'd turn 'em out.

766
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:01,772
- [West] I never
   would've thought of that.

767
00:39:01,772 --> 00:39:04,141
- [Maestro] Well, that's
  why you're not in the game.

768
00:39:04,141 --> 00:39:06,010
I've been here over a
week, and all the doors

769
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:08,112
are locked, and
  it's perfectly safe.

770
00:39:08,112 --> 00:39:10,414
In fact, how did you
  guys get in here?

771
00:39:10,414 --> 00:39:13,651
(footsteps, zombies groaning)

772
00:39:13,651 --> 00:39:15,453
(alarm blares once)

773
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:34,638
- [Maestro] My daddy was a
pimp, my grandpappy was a pimp.

774
00:39:34,638 --> 00:39:37,441
I'm from a long line of
pimps, but I'm the best,

775
00:39:37,441 --> 00:39:39,744
because I play the
bitches like a symphony.

776
00:39:39,744 --> 00:39:41,879
That's why they call me Maestro.

777
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:43,080
Shit, you think
   this is a costume?

778
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:45,816
This is a way of life.
 - [Idaho] Cool...

779
00:39:45,816 --> 00:39:48,085
- [Maestro] But today, shit.

780
00:39:48,085 --> 00:39:50,955
All the bitches in the world
  shake their ass for free.

781
00:39:50,955 --> 00:39:53,324
And these bitches will kill you.

782
00:39:53,324 --> 00:39:54,792
Now, how's a
   motherfucker not supposed

783
00:39:54,792 --> 00:39:56,694
to get motherfuckin' cheese
  when the pussy be attackin.'

784
00:39:57,528 --> 00:40:00,898
So I've just been layin' here,
 L7 til the shit blows over.

785
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:03,200
I figure that pussy'd
 be worth more anyway.

786
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,102
- Look what I found.

787
00:40:05,102 --> 00:40:07,338
- [Idaho] Oh my God, I'm gonna
 eat the shit out of this.

788
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:13,444
(footsteps, zombies groaning)

789
00:40:13,444 --> 00:40:15,479
(electronic music)

790
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:28,426
- [Maestro] And I said, why
  go to an amusement park?

791
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:30,361
That's like the
  stupidest idea ever.

792
00:40:30,361 --> 00:40:31,896
(soft background music) I
 mean, strippers are attracted

793
00:40:31,896 --> 00:40:34,098
to lights and blinky
   shit like that, you know?

794
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:37,234
It's like, they're
   reminded of who they were,

795
00:40:37,234 --> 00:40:39,103
who they always wanted to be.

796
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:40,304
I think that's why
   they're attracted

797
00:40:40,304 --> 00:40:43,007
to the poles on the
  carousels so much.

798
00:40:43,007 --> 00:40:45,209
- We were wondering if you
   wanted to come with us.

799
00:40:47,178 --> 00:40:50,881
- Oh, I don't think so,
   I'm a pimp, I'm a bad man.

800
00:40:50,881 --> 00:40:52,917
- [Idaho] No you're not.
- [Maestro] Yes, I am.

801
00:40:52,917 --> 00:40:55,019
I'd turn these
 bitches out in a day.

802
00:40:55,886 --> 00:40:57,855
Well, you might take
  a little longer.

803
00:40:57,855 --> 00:41:00,024
But you, yeah, I could
 turn you out in a day.

804
00:41:00,024 --> 00:41:02,059
- [Virginia]
  (laughing) Please...

805
00:41:03,561 --> 00:41:06,597
- Eh, no, no, that's
  okay, I like you.

806
00:41:08,265 --> 00:41:09,800
- [Frisco] Take care, man.

807
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:10,801
- [Maestro] Stay fit, bitches.

808
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:13,204
- [West] Take it easy.

809
00:41:13,204 --> 00:41:16,106
(tapping)

810
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:22,680
- Thanks for comin' bitches!

811
00:41:25,616 --> 00:41:26,784
(zombies groaning)

812
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:28,986
(Maestro screams)

813
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:29,854
- Guys...

814
00:41:30,855 --> 00:41:32,523
Guys?

815
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:37,261
(running)

816
00:41:38,796 --> 00:41:40,931
(footsteps)

817
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:45,035
(zombies feeding, splattering)

818
00:42:04,021 --> 00:42:05,756
(gun cocking)

819
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:12,463
(frantic rock music)

820
00:42:12,463 --> 00:42:15,466
- We gotta go, there's no
  way to secure this position.

821
00:42:15,466 --> 00:42:17,701
(running)

822
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:20,504
(zombies growling)

823
00:42:41,659 --> 00:42:43,827
No! They'll hear us.

824
00:42:43,827 --> 00:42:44,828
More will come.

825
00:42:45,663 --> 00:42:46,897
Watch this.

826
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:48,399
(unsheathing machete)

827
00:42:52,937 --> 00:42:54,371
(door closing)

828
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:57,841
(zombies growling)

829
00:42:58,876 --> 00:43:00,411
(kicking)

830
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:04,949
(slicing)

831
00:43:22,499 --> 00:43:24,735
(kicking)

832
00:43:31,141 --> 00:43:34,178
(stabbing, sloshing)

833
00:43:35,579 --> 00:43:36,513
- Look out!

834
00:43:37,848 --> 00:43:39,316
(slamming against Hummer)

835
00:43:41,652 --> 00:43:42,987
(stabbing)

836
00:43:42,987 --> 00:43:44,154
(grunting)

837
00:43:46,657 --> 00:43:48,459
- What are you waiting for?

838
00:43:56,166 --> 00:43:57,968
(splattering)

839
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:02,006
(Hummer accelerates)

840
00:44:15,753 --> 00:44:18,555
- God, you were so Sigourney
  Weaver in Aliens III.

841
00:44:18,555 --> 00:44:19,990
It was awesome!

842
00:44:20,724 --> 00:44:22,826
I don't know many girls
   that can fight like that.

843
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:25,029
- [West] Grandbo
taught us how to fight.

844
00:44:25,029 --> 00:44:27,131
Well, she taught
me how to fight.

845
00:44:28,232 --> 00:44:30,300
Virginia never paid attention.

846
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:31,735
(Virginia humming)

847
00:44:31,735 --> 00:44:33,971
After that, I went
   into the military.

848
00:44:33,971 --> 00:44:35,739
- Which one? Which branch?

849
00:44:35,739 --> 00:44:37,975
- (whispering)
   That's classified.

850
00:44:42,413 --> 00:44:43,580
(clicks tongue)

851
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:45,249
- You know Frisco
  here's trained too.

852
00:44:45,249 --> 00:44:46,517
He's like a cage fighter.

853
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:49,787
- No, I'm a
self-taught ass-kicker.

854
00:44:49,787 --> 00:44:53,724
I just hate fucking strippers.

855
00:44:53,724 --> 00:44:56,160
When you're motivated it's easy.

856
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:59,930
Hey, Ash, look what I
got! (people screaming)

857
00:44:59,930 --> 00:45:01,732
(zombies growling)

858
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,936
(in slow motion) Nooo!

859
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:10,607
I made it this far because
   I don't care anymore.

860
00:45:10,607 --> 00:45:13,077
Ash meant everything to me.

861
00:45:20,718 --> 00:45:23,720
(braking hard, Virginia screams)

862
00:45:25,689 --> 00:45:27,191
- [Idaho] This is it, guys.

863
00:45:27,191 --> 00:45:29,126
Once we cross this line
there's no turning back.

864
00:45:30,327 --> 00:45:32,729
We could die here tonight
  and no one would ever know.

865
00:45:32,729 --> 00:45:34,364
What would the ancient
 Confucius sages

866
00:45:34,364 --> 00:45:36,033
write about us if they could?

867
00:45:36,033 --> 00:45:39,369
Be this the last line-
 - Shut the fuck up!

868
00:45:39,369 --> 00:45:41,872
You are so fucking obnoxious.

869
00:45:41,872 --> 00:45:43,874
(as Idaho) I don't know
how to stop talking.

870
00:45:43,874 --> 00:45:44,975
I-what?

871
00:45:50,347 --> 00:45:53,083
(Hummer accelerates)

872
00:45:58,388 --> 00:45:59,890
- It's beautiful.

873
00:45:59,890 --> 00:46:02,126
- I think so too,
   I love the trees,

874
00:46:02,126 --> 00:46:04,928
and the green, and the
   fresh air, I love it here!

875
00:46:04,928 --> 00:46:06,396
- It's incredible.

876
00:46:06,396 --> 00:46:09,433
- You know, I don't know many
 men that like such things.

877
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:11,902
- Are you kidding?
   It's a paradise.

878
00:46:11,902 --> 00:46:13,937
(soft orchestral music)

879
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:15,606
(kissing, moaning)

880
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:17,741
There are strip
   clubs everywhere!

881
00:46:17,741 --> 00:46:20,244
Ah, I should've move
  to Oregon sooner.

882
00:46:21,311 --> 00:46:23,647
(kicking, Idaho screams)

883
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:30,454
(Hummer accelerates)

884
00:46:37,694 --> 00:46:42,132
- Mm, (yawning)
   oh, where are we?

885
00:46:43,534 --> 00:46:45,602
- Still a ways away.

886
00:46:47,437 --> 00:46:52,376
- Look, I know you guys
both think I'm a retard.

887
00:46:52,376 --> 00:46:55,212
And I'm sorry if
  it seems like I am.

888
00:46:55,212 --> 00:46:57,581
You know, all about
  the strippers...

889
00:46:57,581 --> 00:47:01,018
It's just, I don't know how
  to deal with regular girls.

890
00:47:01,018 --> 00:47:02,920
- No shit.
  - But I'm not trying

891
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:04,087
to be a creep.

892
00:47:04,087 --> 00:47:06,056
I just don't know...

893
00:47:06,056 --> 00:47:07,825
It's hard to talk
   to regular girls.

894
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:09,927
It's hard for me, at least.

895
00:47:09,927 --> 00:47:13,897
With strippers, there was
   a uniform, a protocol.

896
00:47:13,897 --> 00:47:16,834
They act a certain way.
- Are you serious?

897
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:18,101
(scoffs)

898
00:47:19,436 --> 00:47:21,438
- They act that way
  for your money, kid.

899
00:47:21,438 --> 00:47:23,807
- [Idaho] Okay, but at
  least I know what they want.

900
00:47:23,807 --> 00:47:26,476
I mean, maybe someone like
   you knows what women want,

901
00:47:26,476 --> 00:47:28,245
but how am I supposed to tell?

902
00:47:28,245 --> 00:47:30,747
- [Viriginia] Okay,
  this is fucked up.

903
00:47:30,747 --> 00:47:32,716
You group all
  strippers together,

904
00:47:32,716 --> 00:47:34,451
and then you group
  all women together.

905
00:47:34,451 --> 00:47:36,186
You're treating both
  groups like objects.

906
00:47:36,186 --> 00:47:37,588
- No, I-I wasn't...
   - And since strippers are

907
00:47:37,588 --> 00:47:40,257
women too, you're
 double-objecting them.

908
00:47:40,257 --> 00:47:43,060
Strippers take off their
  clothes for money, so what?

909
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:45,095
You know, it takes
 two to make that work.

910
00:47:45,095 --> 00:47:47,731
Some guy sits there, and
pays them to do that.

911
00:47:47,731 --> 00:47:51,134
He's paying her to pretend
   to be interested in him.

912
00:47:51,134 --> 00:47:53,971
Do you know how hard that is?

913
00:47:53,971 --> 00:47:56,607
Imagine pretending not to
   throw up, when an old guy

914
00:47:56,607 --> 00:47:58,742
sits there, who smells
 like piss and tobacco,

915
00:47:58,742 --> 00:48:01,511
and tells you he reminds
   you of his granddaughter.

916
00:48:01,511 --> 00:48:03,313
Or what about the
   greasy managers?

917
00:48:03,313 --> 00:48:06,750
Who angle you for sex, so you
 can get a better-paying shift.

918
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:10,520
Or, imagine trying to be
polite, to creepy guys

919
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:12,356
who think you're in
  a relationship now,

920
00:48:12,356 --> 00:48:13,657
just because they
   saw your snatch-

921
00:48:13,657 --> 00:48:15,058
- Chill out!

922
00:48:16,126 --> 00:48:17,327
(Virginia sighs)

923
00:48:18,629 --> 00:48:20,497
It is what it is,
   but it isn't what

924
00:48:20,497 --> 00:48:22,966
you think it is,
that's for sure.

925
00:48:25,769 --> 00:48:27,871
- Uh, wow.

926
00:48:27,871 --> 00:48:29,806
I had no idea.

927
00:48:33,277 --> 00:48:36,213
- So Virginia, how
  is it that you know

928
00:48:36,213 --> 00:48:38,582
the grind a stripper
  goes through?

929
00:48:41,919 --> 00:48:43,520
(radio crackling)

930
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:45,122
- [Man on radio] Calling
   anyone on this frequency.

931
00:48:45,122 --> 00:48:47,624
If you can hear me,
please listen carefully.

932
00:48:47,624 --> 00:48:50,227
We can give you safety,
there is fresh food,

933
00:48:50,227 --> 00:48:52,396
a warm bed, and hot showers.
  - Oh, my God!

934
00:48:52,396 --> 00:48:53,597
Did you hear that?

935
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:54,965
Hot showers!

936
00:48:54,965 --> 00:48:56,400
(radio crackling)

937
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:57,901
- [Man on radio] Calling
   anyone on this frequency.

938
00:48:57,901 --> 00:48:59,569
- (hitting door) It's on repeat.

939
00:48:59,569 --> 00:49:01,872
It could be old, it
   sounds like a weak signal.

940
00:49:01,872 --> 00:49:04,675
- Well it must be close,
let's check it out.

941
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:11,448
- [Man on radio] Calling
   anyone on this frequency.

942
00:49:11,448 --> 00:49:13,884
If you can hear me,
please listen carefully.

943
00:49:13,884 --> 00:49:16,553
We can give you safety,
there is fresh food,

944
00:49:16,553 --> 00:49:19,289
a warm bed, and hot showers.

945
00:49:19,289 --> 00:49:20,957
Calling anyone on
   this frequency.

946
00:49:20,957 --> 00:49:22,426
(Hummer comes to a stop)
If you can hear me,

947
00:49:22,426 --> 00:49:24,194
please listen carefully.

948
00:49:25,262 --> 00:49:28,165
(truck doors close,
  neon sign buzzing)

949
00:49:28,165 --> 00:49:29,966
- Fuckin' casino.

950
00:49:29,966 --> 00:49:31,902
Let's go.
   - We need to rest,

951
00:49:31,902 --> 00:49:33,503
and you know it.

952
00:49:34,371 --> 00:49:35,339
(zombies growling)

953
00:49:35,339 --> 00:49:36,573
- Company!

954
00:49:37,908 --> 00:49:39,810
(heavy rock)

955
00:49:44,448 --> 00:49:45,749
- [Frisco] Step
   right up, bitches.

956
00:49:45,749 --> 00:49:47,617
Step up to Sniffer's Row.

957
00:49:47,617 --> 00:49:49,786
(starts chainsaw) I got
your pole right here.

958
00:49:49,786 --> 00:49:51,988
(laughing maniacally)

959
00:49:53,357 --> 00:49:54,925
(slicing, squishing)

960
00:49:55,759 --> 00:49:57,661
Hittin' stripper bitches!

961
00:49:58,962 --> 00:50:02,265
(splattering) Heads up!

962
00:50:07,204 --> 00:50:08,872
(slow motion growling)

963
00:50:11,241 --> 00:50:13,310
(speech drowned out by music)

964
00:50:15,712 --> 00:50:17,414
(limbs hitting the ground)

965
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:21,318
(splattering)

966
00:50:21,318 --> 00:50:22,652
Take that, bitches!

967
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,389
Hey, can you do the split?

968
00:50:27,157 --> 00:50:29,393
(zombie screaming, Idaho vomits)

969
00:50:32,529 --> 00:50:33,830
(limbs hitting the ground)

970
00:50:33,830 --> 00:50:35,832
(slow motion screaming)

971
00:50:37,401 --> 00:50:40,237
(slow motion maniacal laughter)

972
00:50:45,108 --> 00:50:46,443
(slow motion screaming)

973
00:50:46,443 --> 00:50:47,944
(maniacal laughter)

974
00:51:06,830 --> 00:51:08,565
Have at it, if you like.

975
00:51:10,834 --> 00:51:12,636
I'm only good at a few things,

976
00:51:12,636 --> 00:51:14,971
and zombie-killing
   is one of them.

977
00:51:14,971 --> 00:51:16,840
(footsteps)

978
00:51:18,708 --> 00:51:21,111
(arcade sounds)

979
00:51:24,281 --> 00:51:26,383
(monitors buzzing)

980
00:51:26,383 --> 00:51:28,051
- [Logan] What's this?

981
00:51:28,051 --> 00:51:29,352
Guests?

982
00:51:33,156 --> 00:51:35,725
I don't remember
  inviting any guests.

983
00:51:35,725 --> 00:51:37,994
Perhaps Mother did.

984
00:51:43,166 --> 00:51:46,303
That's right, finger my
money, you young pup.

985
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:54,177
(mysterious flute
  music) Nice girlies.

986
00:51:54,177 --> 00:51:55,979
Two women.

987
00:51:59,149 --> 00:52:02,385
Oh, goodie, guests. (chuckles)

988
00:52:03,753 --> 00:52:05,489
- Well, I think we're safe here.

989
00:52:09,025 --> 00:52:11,161
(thunder crashes)

990
00:52:12,929 --> 00:52:15,332
- Hello darkness, old friend.

991
00:52:15,332 --> 00:52:18,268
We, who were born in
the crossfire hurricane,

992
00:52:18,268 --> 00:52:20,237
and are hungry like
  the wolves down

993
00:52:20,237 --> 00:52:22,739
due long in the midnight sea...

994
00:52:22,739 --> 00:52:25,275
They shall destroy the night.

995
00:52:25,275 --> 00:52:29,246
The night shall divide
 the day, and vengeance

996
00:52:29,246 --> 00:52:33,683
from the grave shall kill
  those that once were saved.

997
00:52:33,683 --> 00:52:37,587
Exit, light, enter...

998
00:52:37,587 --> 00:52:42,592
Night, I am he, as you
are he, and we together

999
00:52:43,927 --> 00:52:46,863
shall stand up to be
  counted for what we

1000
00:52:46,863 --> 00:52:50,233
are about to receive
  and we shall climb.

1001
00:52:50,233 --> 00:52:54,671
Climb! Climb the stairway,

1002
00:52:54,671 --> 00:52:57,040
to kiss the sky!

1003
00:52:57,040 --> 00:53:01,511
Purple haze, purple
  haze, purple haze!

1004
00:53:01,511 --> 00:53:03,180
(woman screaming) - [Idaho]
  Did they hump the girl?

1005
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:04,681
- Huh?
  - Did they hump her?

1006
00:53:04,681 --> 00:53:06,917
- [Frisco] What? I don't
know, that's not even...

1007
00:53:06,917 --> 00:53:09,119
Look, the book is the
  important part of the story.

1008
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:11,221
- [West] I don't believe that
 at all, what a load of crap.

1009
00:53:11,221 --> 00:53:13,390
- [Virginia] Me neither.
- [West] Sexernomicon...

1010
00:53:13,390 --> 00:53:15,559
I would have expected
 that from him.

1011
00:53:15,559 --> 00:53:16,927
- [Frisco] Ah, whatever.

1012
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:19,663
It's better than military
   chemicals, bad food,

1013
00:53:19,663 --> 00:53:21,665
or strippers without
  enough poles.

1014
00:53:21,665 --> 00:53:23,300
Alright, let's deal.

1015
00:53:24,534 --> 00:53:26,269
(mysterious music,
   monitors buzzing)

1016
00:53:27,604 --> 00:53:28,805
- [Logan] Why
  don't you boys run,

1017
00:53:28,805 --> 00:53:30,206
and fetch them here.
  - [Lackey] Yes, sir.

1018
00:53:39,983 --> 00:53:41,618
(gasping)

1019
00:53:45,755 --> 00:53:49,693
- (cringing) See you got
   two kings, that's no good.

1020
00:53:49,693 --> 00:53:52,395
See, if we were in England,
  under English rules,

1021
00:53:52,395 --> 00:53:54,764
that'd be awesome
  but this is Amurica.

1022
00:53:54,764 --> 00:53:57,701
We got no kings, that fold.

1023
00:53:57,701 --> 00:54:01,705
Ooh, two aces? Ooh, no bueno.

1024
00:54:01,705 --> 00:54:05,775
Sorry boys. (arcade sounds)

1025
00:54:14,484 --> 00:54:15,819
(ahhing)

1026
00:54:19,856 --> 00:54:20,924
- [Virginia] It seems
 strange you guys

1027
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:22,559
have never played Poker before.

1028
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:26,196
- Well, I never saw
 the point, until now.

1029
00:54:31,234 --> 00:54:33,503
- Well, this is kinda boring.

1030
00:54:33,503 --> 00:54:35,639
- [West] Why don't
 we do something else?

1031
00:54:38,141 --> 00:54:42,045
I never saw anyone that
 could use a chainsaw so well.

1032
00:54:42,045 --> 00:54:43,813
- Thank you.

1033
00:54:43,813 --> 00:54:46,216
- So, you ever counted?

1034
00:54:47,317 --> 00:54:49,586
- Counted what?
- Kills.

1035
00:54:50,687 --> 00:54:52,522
- Yeah, actually I have.

1036
00:54:53,723 --> 00:54:55,191
- Well?

1037
00:54:55,859 --> 00:54:59,829
Eighty fucking one of those
  things, eighty fucking one.

1038
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:06,302
- Fuck you.
  - 84.

1039
00:55:06,302 --> 00:55:08,204
(scoffing)

1040
00:55:12,442 --> 00:55:14,411
- [Virginia] So why
 do you keep that book?

1041
00:55:14,411 --> 00:55:16,413
I mean, I see you checking
   it every now and then,

1042
00:55:16,413 --> 00:55:19,282
and I just thought you were
  trying to avoid strippers.

1043
00:55:19,282 --> 00:55:21,551
- Only the infected
  ones. (chuckles)

1044
00:55:22,852 --> 00:55:25,355
Well, since the thing happened
 it's been a great resource.

1045
00:55:25,355 --> 00:55:26,890
I don't keep it to pick them up.

1046
00:55:26,890 --> 00:55:30,226
It's more like, a set
of behaviors, you know?

1047
00:55:30,226 --> 00:55:31,528
A bunch of rules to live by.

1048
00:55:31,528 --> 00:55:34,464
- Sure, if every
  woman was the same.

1049
00:55:34,464 --> 00:55:36,232
- [Idaho] I'm not
   saying that, but,

1050
00:55:36,232 --> 00:55:38,735
when the virus hits,
   they behave very similar.

1051
00:55:39,402 --> 00:55:41,538
I mean, Frisco saved my
ass, but before that,

1052
00:55:41,538 --> 00:55:43,206
it was by the book.

1053
00:55:43,206 --> 00:55:45,675
Guess it's a know-your-enemy
  type of thing.

1054
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:48,511
- Then you're gonna like what
 the doctor has to show you.

1055
00:55:48,511 --> 00:55:50,046
Let's go.

1056
00:55:51,081 --> 00:55:53,550
You, too, bitch, I
ain't got all damn day.

1057
00:55:56,986 --> 00:55:58,855
- So...

1058
00:55:59,889 --> 00:56:02,892
I hear you have a
 thing for baked goods.

1059
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:05,695
How do you like my muffins?

1060
00:56:05,695 --> 00:56:08,064
- Oh, I dunno, I
haven't tried them yet.

1061
00:56:08,064 --> 00:56:09,766
- Do you want to?

1062
00:56:10,533 --> 00:56:12,669
- Are they as good
   as your grandma's?

1063
00:56:12,669 --> 00:56:14,938
- [Lackey] Okay
lovebirds, break it up!

1064
00:56:14,938 --> 00:56:16,106
- [Frisco] You better
 watch where you point

1065
00:56:16,106 --> 00:56:17,707
that thing, or I
  will take you down!

1066
00:56:17,707 --> 00:56:20,210
- [Lackey] Shut the hell
up, and let's get goin'.

1067
00:56:22,545 --> 00:56:24,447
(Logan sipping from cup)

1068
00:56:26,583 --> 00:56:28,485
- [Logan] Mm, oh my.

1069
00:56:29,519 --> 00:56:32,789
(chain clanging) Uh!
Lovely, lovely, lovely.

1070
00:56:32,789 --> 00:56:35,425
(door opening) Welcome!

1071
00:56:35,425 --> 00:56:37,827
Welcome to my humble abode!

1072
00:56:37,827 --> 00:56:40,196
I'm terribly sorry
   about the mess.

1073
00:56:40,196 --> 00:56:42,899
Had I known you were coming,
  I would have picked up.

1074
00:56:42,899 --> 00:56:45,201
(fly buzzing, Logan mumbles)

1075
00:56:45,201 --> 00:56:46,569
You must be thirsty?

1076
00:56:46,569 --> 00:56:47,837
What do you drink?

1077
00:56:47,837 --> 00:56:49,139
- [Virginia] What the
 hell is going on here?

1078
00:56:49,139 --> 00:56:50,406
You have no right-
  - [Logan] (imitates buzzer)

1079
00:56:50,406 --> 00:56:51,641
Wrong!

1080
00:56:51,641 --> 00:56:54,043
I'm terribly sorry,
 but that's incorrect.

1081
00:56:54,043 --> 00:56:56,412
You see, I have every
 right in the world.

1082
00:56:56,412 --> 00:56:59,783
Around these parts, when folks
 come into a man's casino,

1083
00:56:59,783 --> 00:57:02,285
eat his food, play
   with his money,

1084
00:57:02,285 --> 00:57:06,256
kill his girlies,
 that gives him rights.

1085
00:57:06,322 --> 00:57:07,557
Are you sure that I
 can't get you a drink?

1086
00:57:07,557 --> 00:57:09,259
- [West] Who the
 hell are you, mister?

1087
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:14,130
- Doctor, I'm a doctor.
 Doctor Logan, at your cervix!

1088
00:57:14,130 --> 00:57:17,167
Ha! I never get
  tired of that joke.

1089
00:57:17,167 --> 00:57:19,002
- [Idaho] Wait a minute, Logan?

1090
00:57:19,002 --> 00:57:21,437
I know you, you're that
nutjob casino owner

1091
00:57:21,437 --> 00:57:22,806
that killed those
   hookers a few years back.

1092
00:57:22,806 --> 00:57:24,007
- The very same!

1093
00:57:24,007 --> 00:57:25,942
How kind of you to remember.

1094
00:57:25,942 --> 00:57:30,947
And to think, they put me in
 jail for a few, tiny murders.

1095
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:35,919
Took away my casino, separated
 me from my dear mother.

1096
00:57:35,919 --> 00:57:39,222
But, what's that you
  always say, Mother?

1097
00:57:39,222 --> 00:57:41,624
Life throws you a
 lemon, and you make...

1098
00:57:41,624 --> 00:57:43,092
What, what is it?

1099
00:57:43,092 --> 00:57:44,761
Speak up, Mother,
   I can't hear you.

1100
00:57:44,761 --> 00:57:47,297
Life throws you a lemon
and you make what?!

1101
00:57:47,297 --> 00:57:49,098
- Lemon meringue pie?

1102
00:57:49,999 --> 00:57:51,301
- No matter.

1103
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:53,970
My point is, my
   unfortunate incarceration

1104
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:55,505
was all for the best.

1105
00:57:55,505 --> 00:57:59,409
In prison, I had a vision,
   and I dedicated myself

1106
00:57:59,409 --> 00:58:03,279
to the science of retrowifery.

1107
00:58:03,279 --> 00:58:05,582
- [West] Did he really
just say "retrowifery?"

1108
00:58:05,582 --> 00:58:07,050
- [Logan] And then
   the great outbreak

1109
00:58:07,050 --> 00:58:09,118
led me to my destiny.

1110
00:58:09,118 --> 00:58:12,956
Escaping from my
bonds, I returned here,
back to my casino,

1111
00:58:12,956 --> 00:58:16,392
and my dear Mama,
  and dedicated myself

1112
00:58:16,392 --> 00:58:19,262
to the study of this
  mysterious virus.

1113
00:58:19,262 --> 00:58:22,298
All I needed were women
  like you, uninfected women.

1114
00:58:22,298 --> 00:58:23,800
But I couldn't
  find them anywhere.

1115
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:27,470
But Mother said, be patient,
  sonny, didn't you, Mother?

1116
00:58:27,470 --> 00:58:30,640
And of course, she
 was right, as always.

1117
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:34,777
And voila! Here you
  are, uninfected!

1118
00:58:34,777 --> 00:58:37,013
Thank Heavens I
   have you, Mother,

1119
00:58:37,013 --> 00:58:39,616
to lend me a helping hand.

1120
00:58:41,150 --> 00:58:43,186
- [Virginia] Wait a
 minute, wait a minute.

1121
00:58:43,186 --> 00:58:45,521
This is all fascinating,
but I don't understand

1122
00:58:45,521 --> 00:58:47,991
what it has to do
 with my sister and me.

1123
00:58:47,991 --> 00:58:49,492
- Sisters?

1124
00:58:49,492 --> 00:58:51,361
The two of you are sisters?

1125
00:58:51,361 --> 00:58:54,163
Oh, Mommy, this will be fun.

1126
00:58:54,163 --> 00:58:55,365
- [West] Listen,
   you crazy dirtbag.

1127
00:58:55,365 --> 00:58:56,699
I'm gonna give you one chance.

1128
00:58:56,699 --> 00:58:58,401
I demand-
- [Logan] Oh, you're in

1129
00:58:58,401 --> 00:59:00,770
a position to demand nothing!

1130
00:59:00,770 --> 00:59:03,840
And once these gentlemen hear
 about my work with the virus,

1131
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:05,642
they'll be on my side.
- [Frisco] What are you

1132
00:59:05,642 --> 00:59:06,976
babbling about?
   - [Idaho] Are you looking

1133
00:59:06,976 --> 00:59:09,412
for a cure?
  - A cure?

1134
00:59:09,412 --> 00:59:13,082
No, a brave new world!

1135
00:59:13,082 --> 00:59:15,785
Imagine, retrowifery.

1136
00:59:17,253 --> 00:59:19,656
Turning back the clock in time,

1137
00:59:19,656 --> 00:59:22,325
when our women were
 ladies in the parlor,

1138
00:59:22,325 --> 00:59:24,894
and, cover your ears, Mother...

1139
00:59:25,828 --> 00:59:28,097
Whores in the bedroom, heh?

1140
00:59:28,831 --> 00:59:30,066
Imagine...

1141
00:59:30,066 --> 00:59:33,536
Retrowifery, cooking
for us, cleaning for us,

1142
00:59:33,536 --> 00:59:35,672
ironing our shirts just
the way we like them.

1143
00:59:35,672 --> 00:59:37,473
Not too much starch...

1144
00:59:37,473 --> 00:59:41,311
A cure, why would I
  want to find a cure?

1145
00:59:41,311 --> 00:59:44,347
Don't you see, we've been
   given a second chance...

1146
00:59:44,347 --> 00:59:48,184
(laughing) To reshape the
   world so that the women,

1147
00:59:48,184 --> 00:59:50,653
dance to our tune...

1148
00:59:51,754 --> 00:59:53,856
Instead of us dancing to theirs.

1149
00:59:53,856 --> 00:59:56,960
- You're nuts!
- Ha! Nuts am I?

1150
00:59:56,960 --> 01:00:01,798
Do you call this, nuts?! Huh?!

1151
01:00:01,864 --> 01:00:05,034
This is Day! (zombie growling)

1152
01:00:05,034 --> 01:00:08,905
I taught her how to
 paint my fingernails.

1153
01:00:08,905 --> 01:00:12,642
Okay, it's not the neatest
   job, and she did bite me.

1154
01:00:12,642 --> 01:00:16,613
My point is, if I could
  teach her to do my manicure,

1155
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:20,350
then cooking me a nice,
   juicy steak be far behind?

1156
01:00:20,350 --> 01:00:23,586
Ah! Rearranging my
closets, helping me find

1157
01:00:23,586 --> 01:00:25,788
the matches for my hosiery!

1158
01:00:27,357 --> 01:00:30,393
Gentlemen, imagine,
coming home, and finding

1159
01:00:30,393 --> 01:00:34,897
your woman ready for
you, down on all fours,

1160
01:00:34,897 --> 01:00:37,800
scrubbing the kitchen floor.

1161
01:00:38,768 --> 01:00:40,269
Is there anything...

1162
01:00:40,269 --> 01:00:42,405
more intoxicating than that?

1163
01:00:42,405 --> 01:00:46,909
Imagine quiet dinners for
   two, linen tablecloths,

1164
01:00:46,909 --> 01:00:49,178
Mother's gold-ridden
  china, your wife,

1165
01:00:49,178 --> 01:00:53,016
gazes adoringly at you as
   she silently strokes...

1166
01:00:54,017 --> 01:00:55,218
your thigh.

1167
01:00:55,218 --> 01:00:59,288
And you tell her
 about your long, hard,

1168
01:00:59,288 --> 01:01:03,192
day at the casino,
 and then while she...

1169
01:01:03,192 --> 01:01:04,794
tidies up the dishes,

1170
01:01:04,794 --> 01:01:08,564
you go soak in a nice, hot tub.

1171
01:01:09,465 --> 01:01:13,703
She comes in, and washes you
  with the antiseptic soap,

1172
01:01:13,703 --> 01:01:16,039
and then she brings
  you into her bed,

1173
01:01:16,039 --> 01:01:19,375
with its
freshly-bleached sheets.

1174
01:01:19,375 --> 01:01:23,513
While the sweet scent of
her perfume, mixed with

1175
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:27,116
the magnificent aroma
 of cleaning products,

1176
01:01:27,116 --> 01:01:30,019
drives you mad with desire.

1177
01:01:30,019 --> 01:01:34,357
Imagine this, gentlemen,
 every night, 365 days a year.

1178
01:01:34,357 --> 01:01:37,927
Doing the naughty with a women
 who never has a headache,

1179
01:01:37,927 --> 01:01:40,963
never makes you beg for
it, never laughs at you,

1180
01:01:40,963 --> 01:01:43,099
never rejects you,
   never makes you

1181
01:01:43,099 --> 01:01:45,835
choose between her and Mother?!

1182
01:01:49,105 --> 01:01:51,407
- [West] Wait a minute,
  you're planning to infect us

1183
01:01:51,407 --> 01:01:54,477
so we can starch your shirts?
 - [Logan] Surely you gentlemen

1184
01:01:54,477 --> 01:01:58,014
see the genius of my brave,
 new world. (squeezing syringe)

1185
01:01:58,014 --> 01:02:00,883
These girls of yours
 will become infected.

1186
01:02:00,883 --> 01:02:04,720
All girls do, one way
 or another. (laughing)

1187
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:06,522
Don't you see? Don't
  you understand?

1188
01:02:06,522 --> 01:02:10,460
Instead of killing us, they'll
 become our slaves, huh?

1189
01:02:10,460 --> 01:02:13,729
And I'll teach them what
it is to serve a man,

1190
01:02:13,729 --> 01:02:16,365
from banging us
   to baking for us.

1191
01:02:16,365 --> 01:02:18,301
- [Frisco] Did you
   just say baking?

1192
01:02:18,301 --> 01:02:20,369
Because baking is
   a special skill.

1193
01:02:20,369 --> 01:02:21,871
It takes years to
   master, you want

1194
01:02:21,871 --> 01:02:23,372
these bitches to do it?

1195
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:26,909
(sighing) You really are insane.

1196
01:02:26,909 --> 01:02:29,712
- [Logan] You're ranting
  about baking and I'm insane?

1197
01:02:29,712 --> 01:02:31,447
Get rid of them.

1198
01:02:32,682 --> 01:02:35,885
I want to study these
specimens more closely.

1199
01:02:35,885 --> 01:02:38,788
(squeezing syringe, door closes)

1200
01:02:43,993 --> 01:02:48,698
Heh, bodies like strippers.

1201
01:02:50,399 --> 01:02:53,836
(chuckling) Are you sure
  you're not infected already?

1202
01:02:53,836 --> 01:02:56,272
(zombie growls, chain clanging)

1203
01:02:56,272 --> 01:02:58,207
(Logan laughs)

1204
01:02:59,575 --> 01:03:03,312
And you, my dear, you...

1205
01:03:05,781 --> 01:03:07,016
truly are...

1206
01:03:08,084 --> 01:03:09,785
(in a whisper) delicious.

1207
01:03:09,785 --> 01:03:11,320
(zombie gasping frantically)

1208
01:03:11,320 --> 01:03:14,857
You know, I don't
  have to infect you.

1209
01:03:15,725 --> 01:03:16,859
If you could...

1210
01:03:17,727 --> 01:03:21,931
See your way to
  embrace retrowifery,

1211
01:03:21,931 --> 01:03:25,668
(squeezes syringe) without
   my special treatment.

1212
01:03:26,836 --> 01:03:30,640
I so, so want to kiss you.

1213
01:03:31,541 --> 01:03:34,076
But you are just too
  disgusting! (spits)

1214
01:03:34,810 --> 01:03:36,612
(syringe shatters, zombie gasps)

1215
01:03:36,612 --> 01:03:37,547
(zombie growls, gun clicks)

1216
01:03:37,547 --> 01:03:39,081
Stay where you are, both of you!

1217
01:03:39,081 --> 01:03:41,117
That's an order.
- Yes, sir.

1218
01:03:41,117 --> 01:03:42,885
(zombie growling) Fuck you, sir.

1219
01:03:42,885 --> 01:03:44,620
(kicks gun, grunts)

1220
01:03:45,588 --> 01:03:47,423
(Logan cries out,
   zombie feeding)

1221
01:03:47,423 --> 01:03:49,258
(screaming in pain)

1222
01:03:50,259 --> 01:03:52,728
- [Logan] Ow, Mommy, a boo-boo!

1223
01:03:52,728 --> 01:03:56,032
You feminists! Time to die!

1224
01:03:56,799 --> 01:03:57,900
(buzzer blaring,
chains clanging)

1225
01:03:57,900 --> 01:04:00,703
Kill, my pets, kill them!

1226
01:04:00,703 --> 01:04:03,172
No, no!

1227
01:04:03,172 --> 01:04:05,808
(Logan screaming)

1228
01:04:05,808 --> 01:04:07,610
(zombies growling)
   - [West] Guess you

1229
01:04:07,610 --> 01:04:09,045
haven't finished
  their training yet.

1230
01:04:09,045 --> 01:04:10,413
(door kicks open)

1231
01:04:11,214 --> 01:04:13,249
You're okay!
  - Of course.

1232
01:04:14,150 --> 01:04:15,618
Two things I hate most.

1233
01:04:15,618 --> 01:04:18,454
Strippers, and redneck
 goons, dumb and slow.

1234
01:04:18,454 --> 01:04:19,856
- [Idaho] Are you okay?

1235
01:04:19,856 --> 01:04:22,225
- We're fine, but I think
   he's had better days.

1236
01:04:22,225 --> 01:04:23,826
(limbs ripping)

1237
01:04:26,162 --> 01:04:29,765
- [Logan] Ladies! Don't
   forget your table manners.

1238
01:04:29,765 --> 01:04:32,835
(screaming in pain,
  zombies growling)

1239
01:04:42,812 --> 01:04:45,982
- Sorry, I'm late,
 boss, I picked up meat
 and it was rancid.

1240
01:04:47,450 --> 01:04:51,053
Oh, I see I caught you at a
  bad time, I'm gonna go now.

1241
01:04:51,053 --> 01:04:53,889
(zombies feeding, door closes)

1242
01:04:54,857 --> 01:04:56,993
(Hummer accelerates)

1243
01:05:03,266 --> 01:05:06,669
- [West] So, since you're
   avoiding the subject,

1244
01:05:06,669 --> 01:05:09,238
do you think there's
  a chance for us?

1245
01:05:10,706 --> 01:05:13,342
Don't give me that
  strong, silent shit.

1246
01:05:13,342 --> 01:05:15,678
Do I think there's
   a chance for what?

1247
01:05:15,678 --> 01:05:17,880
Did I think there was a
chance that some virus

1248
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:19,415
would come along,
  and turn every woman

1249
01:05:19,415 --> 01:05:22,018
into some freaky
  exhibitionist ghoul?

1250
01:05:22,018 --> 01:05:24,620
Did I think there was a chance
 I'd be driving the last two

1251
01:05:24,620 --> 01:05:27,123
supposedly non-stripper
chicks into the center

1252
01:05:27,123 --> 01:05:28,891
of this whole
  fucking apocolypse?

1253
01:05:28,891 --> 01:05:31,594
Can't say I've been very good
 at predicting the future.

1254
01:05:31,594 --> 01:05:34,664
Don't ask me about chances,
 I'm not much of a bettin' man.

1255
01:05:34,664 --> 01:05:38,567
- [West] No, you're terrible,
 don't ever play Poker again.

1256
01:05:38,567 --> 01:05:42,571
Not that I'm complaining,
   but, you suck! (laughing)

1257
01:05:44,206 --> 01:05:45,508
- You see that?

1258
01:05:46,309 --> 01:05:47,543
- Yeah.

1259
01:05:49,745 --> 01:05:51,914
- [West] Looks like a
big house, or something.

1260
01:05:53,215 --> 01:05:55,384
- [Frisco] (scoffs) Tacky.

1261
01:05:56,585 --> 01:05:57,920
- [West] Listen, if we're
  about to go into the middle

1262
01:05:57,920 --> 01:05:59,255
of some stripper storm, I would

1263
01:05:59,255 --> 01:06:01,357
like to be well-rested and fed.

1264
01:06:01,357 --> 01:06:04,360
Just once, I would
  like to relax a bit.

1265
01:06:05,494 --> 01:06:08,731
(downbeat rock
   music, door opens)

1266
01:06:12,435 --> 01:06:15,071
(keypad beeping)

1267
01:06:17,206 --> 01:06:19,375
(gate opening)

1268
01:06:20,576 --> 01:06:22,778
- (patting Idaho)
 Wake up, sleepyheads.

1269
01:06:25,648 --> 01:06:27,450
(door closes)

1270
01:06:33,556 --> 01:06:36,425
(driving over gravel)

1271
01:06:48,304 --> 01:06:51,607
(truck doors closing)

1272
01:07:13,763 --> 01:07:16,332
- [Virginia] Oh, my, God.

1273
01:07:18,401 --> 01:07:20,136
- [Idaho] Holy shit!

1274
01:07:20,970 --> 01:07:22,605
I don't believe it!

1275
01:07:22,605 --> 01:07:24,039
It's his house!

1276
01:07:24,039 --> 01:07:25,274
- Who's house?

1277
01:07:25,274 --> 01:07:26,742
- [Idaho] Guy Gibson!
You know, the tough guy

1278
01:07:26,742 --> 01:07:28,677
from TV that sells the barbeque?

1279
01:07:28,677 --> 01:07:30,513
You know, "knock
  this from my hand!"

1280
01:07:30,513 --> 01:07:32,014
- Who?
 - [Idaho] Oh, come on.

1281
01:07:32,014 --> 01:07:33,048
Dude, where have you been?

1282
01:07:33,048 --> 01:07:34,450
He's like the biggest star ever.

1283
01:07:34,450 --> 01:07:36,252
We're gonna search the
   house; you two stay here.

1284
01:07:36,252 --> 01:07:39,221
- Heh, he was so good
 in so many things!

1285
01:07:39,221 --> 01:07:41,857
- Hunters from Space!
  - Super American Army Eagle?

1286
01:07:41,857 --> 01:07:43,025
- He was the guy who like, came

1287
01:07:43,025 --> 01:07:44,427
through the smoke,
   waving the flag.

1288
01:07:44,427 --> 01:07:45,594
- Detective Grindstone!

1289
01:07:45,594 --> 01:07:46,862
- [Virginia] I have
  the whole series.

1290
01:07:46,862 --> 01:07:47,830
(as Guy Gibson) It's not
how many punks ya kill,

1291
01:07:47,830 --> 01:07:49,632
it's how many ya scare straight.

1292
01:07:49,632 --> 01:07:51,000
(briefcase hitting floor)

1293
01:07:52,101 --> 01:07:54,370
(crickets chirping, owl hooting)

1294
01:07:55,438 --> 01:07:57,640
(mumbling)

1295
01:08:03,512 --> 01:08:05,414
(footsteps)

1296
01:08:05,414 --> 01:08:07,016
(clock ticking)

1297
01:08:07,016 --> 01:08:08,317
(setting down gun)

1298
01:08:08,317 --> 01:08:09,585
- [Frisco] Ooh.

1299
01:08:23,065 --> 01:08:25,634
- [Virginia] My mom used
to think he was so hot.

1300
01:08:25,634 --> 01:08:27,970
I can't believe this
  is really his place!

1301
01:08:27,970 --> 01:08:29,905
- What about the Mob Boss?

1302
01:08:29,905 --> 01:08:31,407
(as Guy Gibson)
   You do me wrong...

1303
01:08:31,407 --> 01:08:33,309
Why would you wanna do me wrong?

1304
01:08:33,309 --> 01:08:35,478
- Classic.
   - So good.

1305
01:08:37,613 --> 01:08:39,648
(growling)

1306
01:08:42,818 --> 01:08:45,454
(footsteps, clock ticking)

1307
01:08:55,498 --> 01:08:57,867
(clock strikes
 midnight, gun cocking)

1308
01:09:12,448 --> 01:09:13,883
- [Virginia] Or how
  about Moon Smashers,

1309
01:09:13,883 --> 01:09:15,918
where they're doing the lunar
 chasing without helmets.

1310
01:09:18,287 --> 01:09:20,022
(ice clinging,
   Virginia laughing)

1311
01:09:20,022 --> 01:09:21,223
Or how 'bout-
 - [Guy] What the fuck

1312
01:09:21,223 --> 01:09:23,259
are you assholes
   doing in my house?

1313
01:09:25,594 --> 01:09:30,332
Allow me to reiterate, my house.

1314
01:09:30,332 --> 01:09:33,602
(singsongy) Assholes,
 what the fuck?

1315
01:09:35,104 --> 01:09:39,108
- [Idaho] Mr. Gibson!
 - The one and only!

1316
01:09:42,645 --> 01:09:44,146
- [Idaho] We are so sorry.

1317
01:09:44,146 --> 01:09:46,615
We are your biggest
  fans! (Guy scoffs)

1318
01:09:46,615 --> 01:09:50,586
- Yeah, right, kids your
  age don't even remember me.

1319
01:09:50,586 --> 01:09:54,323
Well, you put the guns
 away, I am yesterday.

1320
01:09:54,323 --> 01:09:56,959
Did you buy my last DVD?
- [Virginia] Yes.

1321
01:09:56,959 --> 01:09:59,528
They Call Me Guy, When
 Will They Call Me Sir?

1322
01:09:59,528 --> 01:10:02,364
It was a lot more introspective
than your other stuff.

1323
01:10:02,364 --> 01:10:04,200
- Oh, well then by
  all means, feel free

1324
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:06,669
to jump all over my furniture.

1325
01:10:06,669 --> 01:10:09,605
Nobody cares about some old
  action star anymore, huh?

1326
01:10:09,605 --> 01:10:12,775
They threw me on the heap
   with Chuck and Charlie.

1327
01:10:12,775 --> 01:10:15,411
Yeah! Ah.

1328
01:10:15,411 --> 01:10:18,714
Now (grunting) they
  want pretty boys.

1329
01:10:18,714 --> 01:10:21,717
You know, shaving your
  chest is no way to be a man.

1330
01:10:21,717 --> 01:10:23,886
- Uh, sir?
  - [Guy] Sir?

1331
01:10:23,886 --> 01:10:28,424
What is it, tea time?
 - Why are you dressed

1332
01:10:28,424 --> 01:10:30,859
like a hooker? (Guy
laughs, Idaho chuckles)

1333
01:10:30,859 --> 01:10:32,962
- How'd you hook
   up with this guy?

1334
01:10:32,962 --> 01:10:35,731
Obviously... (sighing)

1335
01:10:35,731 --> 01:10:39,101
I dress this way, to blend in.

1336
01:10:39,101 --> 01:10:40,869
- [Idaho] Sorry, what?

1337
01:10:40,869 --> 01:10:44,873
- Oh, seriously, how did you
two dim bulbs make it this far?

1338
01:10:44,873 --> 01:10:47,343
Alright, I go into town dressed

1339
01:10:47,343 --> 01:10:50,446
like this, and
   nobody bothers me.

1340
01:10:53,182 --> 01:10:56,185
(Idaho laughs) Ahh,
  oh boy. (chuckles)

1341
01:10:56,185 --> 01:10:58,320
You too would really like
   these dead strippers.

1342
01:10:58,320 --> 01:11:00,522
They're almost as
 smart as you too are.

1343
01:11:08,897 --> 01:11:12,801
Thousands of good men eaten,
 and somehow you survived, huh!

1344
01:11:12,801 --> 01:11:14,470
Oh, you're not much
  better sweetheart,

1345
01:11:14,470 --> 01:11:16,605
I mean seriously, who do
   you think you're fooling?

1346
01:11:16,605 --> 01:11:18,440
What, did you just,
  climb right off

1347
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:20,843
the pole before
   all this happened?

1348
01:11:20,843 --> 01:11:22,845
(Guy and Idaho laugh) -
  [Virginia] What do you mean?

1349
01:11:22,845 --> 01:11:24,580
Oh, come on, usually
I'm answering questions

1350
01:11:24,580 --> 01:11:27,449
about dead strippers, not
   questioning live ones.

1351
01:11:27,449 --> 01:11:30,019
Oh, and by the way,
  how does it feel

1352
01:11:30,019 --> 01:11:32,354
to be the worst-dressed
woman on the planet?

1353
01:11:32,354 --> 01:11:35,057
(laughs) Okay, I'm kidding.
  (pats Virginia's leg)

1354
01:11:35,057 --> 01:11:36,825
Actually, I'm glad you're here.

1355
01:11:36,825 --> 01:11:38,360
- Really?
  - [Guy] Mhm.

1356
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:41,096
(Frisco playing piano)

1357
01:11:41,096 --> 01:11:43,465
- This place has a
  generator and tons of food.

1358
01:11:43,465 --> 01:11:45,567
Towels were damp
in the bathroom.

1359
01:11:45,567 --> 01:11:47,236
Somebody's been here recently.

1360
01:11:47,236 --> 01:11:49,104
By the way, did you see
   the thread count on those?

1361
01:11:50,306 --> 01:11:53,075
- You're right,
 someone has been here.

1362
01:11:54,243 --> 01:11:55,911
But we're here now.

1363
01:11:55,911 --> 01:11:58,447
Maybe we can finally
  relax a little.

1364
01:11:59,448 --> 01:12:03,285
You know, I noticed
  a hot tub outside.

1365
01:12:04,253 --> 01:12:06,955
It's got some jets, bubbles...

1366
01:12:06,955 --> 01:12:09,358
(Virginia screams, piano closes)

1367
01:12:09,358 --> 01:12:11,160
(running, gun cocking)

1368
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:12,961
(Idaho and Virginia laughing)

1369
01:12:12,961 --> 01:12:17,166
- [Guy] And I said, slide,
 and he falls over an Italian!

1370
01:12:17,166 --> 01:12:19,168
No one's gonna believe
 you can beat this guy!

1371
01:12:19,168 --> 01:12:20,669
Alright, I said,
besides, name me

1372
01:12:20,669 --> 01:12:22,805
one successful
  boxing movie, right?

1373
01:12:22,805 --> 01:12:25,374
(all laughing)

1374
01:12:25,374 --> 01:12:27,643
(running)

1375
01:12:27,643 --> 01:12:29,144
That's ol' Jean-Claude.

1376
01:12:29,144 --> 01:12:31,714
And he's always
   doing the splits.

1377
01:12:31,714 --> 01:12:33,782
I mean it's really kinda
  gross, you know what I mean?

1378
01:12:33,782 --> 01:12:35,184
We're doing rehearsal
   one time, and I look over

1379
01:12:35,184 --> 01:12:36,352
and he's got his
  leg up on the wall,

1380
01:12:36,352 --> 01:12:38,420
like some kind of ballet dancer.

1381
01:12:38,420 --> 01:12:40,622
(Virginia laughing) It's
un-American, isn't it?

1382
01:12:40,622 --> 01:12:42,291
(all laughing)

1383
01:12:44,526 --> 01:12:47,463
And then Chuck, right, he
thinks he's all this tough-guy.

1384
01:12:47,463 --> 01:12:49,631
But you know what? He's
afraid of the Bigfoot.

1385
01:12:49,631 --> 01:12:50,799
- [Idaho and Virginia] What?
  - [Guy] I know!

1386
01:12:50,799 --> 01:12:52,034
Seriously, he
 believes in this shit.

1387
01:12:52,034 --> 01:12:53,302
(Idaho and Virginia
laughing) So one night,

1388
01:12:53,302 --> 01:12:54,403
we decide we're gonna
 play a joke on him.

1389
01:12:54,403 --> 01:12:56,004
So I walk up to him and I-

1390
01:12:56,004 --> 01:12:57,706
(running)

1391
01:12:57,706 --> 01:12:59,842

1392

1393

(Guy grunting)

1394
01:13:04,346 --> 01:13:05,748
(Guy groaning) - What the hell?

1395
01:13:05,748 --> 01:13:07,649
- [Idaho] Dude, it's Guy Gibson!

1396
01:13:07,649 --> 01:13:09,084
- Who? (squishing, splattering)

1397
01:13:09,084 --> 01:13:10,385
- [Idaho and Virginia] We
  are so, so sorry Mr. Gibson.

1398
01:13:10,385 --> 01:13:11,620
- [Frisco] Who the
   hell is this guy?

1399
01:13:11,620 --> 01:13:13,355
What the fuck is he
 wearing? (Guy coughs)

1400
01:13:13,355 --> 01:13:16,825
(splattering, coughing)

1401
01:13:18,827 --> 01:13:22,197
I would have liked to have
killed in my last performance...

1402
01:13:22,197 --> 01:13:24,500
(coughing, somber piano music)

1403
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:28,804
Instead, I die! (sighs)

1404
01:13:35,778 --> 01:13:38,847
(crows calling)

1405
01:13:38,847 --> 01:13:40,816
(shovel hitting)

1406
01:13:42,384 --> 01:13:44,453
(birds chirping)

1407
01:13:51,827 --> 01:13:54,129
- You sure that your Grandbo
  will bake me something?

1408
01:13:54,129 --> 01:13:55,597
- She will.

1409
01:13:57,232 --> 01:13:58,801
- Ash was the best.

1410
01:14:02,938 --> 01:14:05,707
(sniffling) I miss him so much.

1411
01:14:15,017 --> 01:14:16,919
(whispering)

1412
01:14:18,387 --> 01:14:19,855
- [West] He's a fairy.

1413
01:14:19,855 --> 01:14:21,623
- Well, I could've
   told you that.

1414
01:14:21,623 --> 01:14:23,292
- Well how was I
   supposed to know?

1415
01:14:23,292 --> 01:14:26,161
- I had no idea, I met him
  just before I met you guys.

1416
01:14:26,161 --> 01:14:28,630
- [West] Whatever, it
 just explains a lot.

1417
01:14:28,630 --> 01:14:30,599
I mean, I thought I
  was losing my touch.

1418
01:14:30,599 --> 01:14:33,268
- Well, I can tell
  you that you aren't.

1419
01:14:37,372 --> 01:14:39,942
(sets down glass) We should go.

1420
01:14:40,909 --> 01:14:43,111
Stayin' here ain't
 gonna get any easier.

1421
01:14:44,313 --> 01:14:45,614
- You're right.

1422
01:14:49,551 --> 01:14:51,420

1423
01:14:52,888 --> 01:14:55,257

- Huh, fabulous.

1427
01:15:24,052 --> 01:15:25,988
Good luck I'm not a bettin' man.

1428
01:15:29,024 --> 01:15:30,659

1430
01:15:43,872 --> 01:15:46,208
Think I can turn 'em on inside.

1431
01:15:46,208 --> 01:15:48,310
- I need to find a bathroom.

1432
01:15:55,417 --> 01:15:57,219
(jiggling door
 knobs) Of course not.

1433

  gonna believe this.

1439
01:16:24,613 --> 01:16:26,548
- Strip club?
 - Fuckin' aye.

1440
01:16:31,053 --> 01:16:32,821
- Shut the door, shut the door!

1441
01:16:32,821 --> 01:16:34,690

(plastic packaging crinkling)

1444
01:16:47,569 --> 01:16:49,171

  we're in the truck.

(zombies groaning)

1446
01:16:52,908 --> 01:16:54,509
Shit! Now they're in the truck.

1448
01:16:57,446 --> 01:16:59,681
Shit, now they're throwing
   our stuff on the ground.

1449

1452
01:17:07,055 --> 01:17:09,024
- [West] Check it
  out, we got snacks.

1453
01:17:11,259 --> 01:17:13,762
(bags crinkling) Shit,
 what do we do now?

1454
01:17:13,762 --> 01:17:14,997
There's a horde
   of them out there.

1455
01:17:14,997 --> 01:17:16,598
I don't even have my blades!

1456
01:17:16,598 --> 01:17:18,467
What the fuck is
  it with this place?

1457
01:17:18,467 --> 01:17:20,302
Gas station-strip clubs?

1458
01:17:20,302 --> 01:17:21,536
You're gonna have to shoot them.

1459
01:17:21,536 --> 01:17:22,671
- I don't-

1460
01:17:22,671 --> 01:17:24,106
- [West] You don't
   have your gun?

1461
01:17:24,106 --> 01:17:25,841
What the fuck is wrong with-
  - Hey, why don't you pull

  out of your ass?

1463
01:17:27,676 --> 01:17:28,944
We don't have time
  to fight about this.

1464
01:17:28,944 --> 01:17:30,345
We have to do something.

01:24:12,847 --> 01:24:14,916
(wiping blood)

1540
01:24:14,916 --> 01:24:17,085
(flame igniting)

1541
01:24:17,085 --> 01:24:19,154
(zombies groaning)

1542
01:24:20,588 --> 01:24:22,157
(explosion)

1543
01:24:23,358 --> 01:24:26,094
- [West] Let's
   see, that's 85....

1544
01:24:26,094 --> 01:24:31,099
86, 87, (sucks teeth) ooh, 88!

1545
01:24:31,199 --> 01:24:32,801
Ouch!

1546
01:24:33,668 --> 01:24:35,136
- [Idaho] That was
   awesome, Virginia!

1547
01:24:35,136 --> 01:24:37,472
You saved us back there!
   - [Frisco] My rainbow ass!

1548
01:24:37,472 --> 01:24:39,140
Anything else you wanna tell us?

1549
01:24:39,140 --> 01:24:41,643
- Okay, so I can dance.
- Liar, liar,

1550
01:24:41,643 --> 01:24:43,111
pants on fuckin' fire!

1551
01:24:44,245 --> 01:24:45,880
In a world full of
  homicidal strippers and I'm

1552
01:24:45,880 --> 01:24:47,615
chauffeuring one
   in the back seat.

1553
01:24:48,516 --> 01:24:51,820
- [Idaho] Wait a minute,
you're a stripper?

1554
01:24:51,820 --> 01:24:54,255
(Hummer accelerating)

1555
01:24:55,356 --> 01:24:58,159
So, anyway, what I
   was saying before,

1556
01:24:58,159 --> 01:25:00,595
about strippers,
   wasn't about you.

1557
01:25:00,595 --> 01:25:04,165
I mean, it was, but of
course you're different,

1558
01:25:04,165 --> 01:25:05,600
because you're not infected,
  but- (Frisco snaps)

1559
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:06,668
- Shut the fuck up.

1560
01:25:07,569 --> 01:25:09,537
(bell tolling)

1561
01:25:12,040 --> 01:25:14,542
(ominous music)

1562
01:25:17,078 --> 01:25:19,948
(truck doors closing)

1563
01:25:23,751 --> 01:25:25,620
- [Idaho] Stripper Alley.

1564
01:25:25,620 --> 01:25:29,057
Never will you find
  a more wretched hive
  of sex and villany.

1565
01:25:29,858 --> 01:25:31,226
- [Frisco] We must be careful.

1566
01:25:31,226 --> 01:25:32,727
- [West] Sun's comin' up.

1567
01:25:32,727 --> 01:25:33,828
The roar of the
  engine will be heard

1568
01:25:33,828 --> 01:25:35,630
from all over the city anyway.

1569
01:25:35,630 --> 01:25:37,065
Soon, they'll see us too.

1570
01:25:37,866 --> 01:25:39,801
- Should we wait?
   - [Frisco] Nope.

1571
01:25:39,801 --> 01:25:42,837
They can see us,
we can see them.

1572
01:25:44,305 --> 01:25:46,741
(Hummer accelerating)

1573
01:26:15,937 --> 01:26:17,605
(truck dashboard beeps)

1574
01:26:24,412 --> 01:26:26,247
(truck dashboard beeps)

1575
01:26:26,247 --> 01:26:28,182
Fuck-a-doodle-dandy!

1576
01:26:29,384 --> 01:26:31,686
- I thought that only
happened in the movies.

1577
01:26:39,694 --> 01:26:41,396
(truck door opens)

1578
01:26:43,531 --> 01:26:44,832
(truck doors closing)

1579
01:26:56,210 --> 01:26:58,112
- [Frisco] Somethin'
  bad happened here.

1580
01:26:58,112 --> 01:26:59,547
- We gotta keep movin'.

1581
01:27:04,218 --> 01:27:05,954
(truck doors closing)

1582
01:27:07,322 --> 01:27:08,423
- Hoe!

1583
01:27:13,828 --> 01:27:16,898
(fumbling, mumbling)

1584
01:27:19,200 --> 01:27:20,668
Here you go.

1585
01:27:21,302 --> 01:27:23,905
(unsheathing) - What am I
   supposed to do with these?

1586
01:27:23,905 --> 01:27:25,473
- [Frisco] That's
   all we have left.

1587
01:27:27,375 --> 01:27:28,376
- What are you
  gonna do with that?

1588
01:27:28,376 --> 01:27:29,744
You need more weapons.

1589
01:27:29,744 --> 01:27:31,646
- I'm not leaving this.

1590
01:27:35,950 --> 01:27:37,251
- [Frisco] For you.

1591
01:27:39,721 --> 01:27:41,956
(Frisco laughing)

1592
01:27:46,327 --> 01:27:47,562
(gun cocking)

1593
01:27:47,562 --> 01:27:49,864
(crickets chirping,
 dog barks in distance)

1594
01:27:52,433 --> 01:27:53,701
- Let's do this.

1595
01:28:01,743 --> 01:28:03,211
(footsteps)

1596
01:28:03,211 --> 01:28:06,614
(coyote howling in
 distance, baby crying)

1597
01:28:10,585 --> 01:28:11,886
(glass breaking)

1598
01:28:21,195 --> 01:28:23,598
(heavy rock music)

1599
01:28:23,598 --> 01:28:26,034
(zombie growling)

1600
01:28:37,378 --> 01:28:40,415
(zombies growling,
   Idaho screaming)

1601
01:28:49,824 --> 01:28:52,193
It's locked!
- [Frisco] C'mon, c'mon!

1602
01:28:54,796 --> 01:28:56,998
(footsteps)

1603
01:29:02,370 --> 01:29:06,107
(shotgun blasts)

1604
01:29:23,591 --> 01:29:25,593
(dinging)

1605
01:29:27,562 --> 01:29:28,596
You!

1606
01:29:30,264 --> 01:29:32,133
- You have got to be kidding me.

1607
01:29:32,133 --> 01:29:34,469
- A pole in a sandwich shop?

1608
01:29:35,336 --> 01:29:37,371
(zombie hissing)

1609
01:29:37,371 --> 01:29:38,806
(hitting, splattering)

1610
01:29:39,540 --> 01:29:41,609
Rule#11: Never eat at a
 strip club. (typewriter ding)

1611
01:29:41,609 --> 01:29:42,744
- [Frisco] Shut
   up, turd burglar.

1612
01:29:42,744 --> 01:29:44,378
We have to barricade
  this door more.

1613
01:29:44,378 --> 01:29:45,613
Grab the chair!

1614
01:29:47,648 --> 01:29:49,317
(chair sliding)

1615
01:29:49,317 --> 01:29:51,719
(zombies groaning)

1616
01:29:51,719 --> 01:29:52,954
(body hits floor)

1617
01:29:55,289 --> 01:29:56,424
(unsheathing knives)

1618
01:29:56,424 --> 01:29:59,026
(slicing, splattering)

1619
01:29:59,026 --> 01:30:00,795
(heavy rock)

1620
01:30:04,031 --> 01:30:05,600
(door opens)

1621
01:30:06,567 --> 01:30:07,502
(zombie hissing)

1622
01:30:07,502 --> 01:30:09,203
(hitting, stick lands on floor)

1623
01:30:10,605 --> 01:30:12,373
- It's not working!

1624
01:30:16,644 --> 01:30:17,945
(hits zombie with briefcase)

1625
01:30:19,981 --> 01:30:22,750

01:30:25,153 --> 01:30:28,523
(shotgun blasting)

1628
01:30:28,523 --> 01:30:30,658
- 88!
 - 96.

1629
01:30:33,394 --> 01:30:37,432
We gotta go! (shotgun blasting)

1630
01:30:39,967 --> 01:30:41,969
(zombie growls)

1631
01:30:43,004 --> 01:30:44,539
(shotgun blast)

1632
01:30:50,378 --> 01:30:51,979
(Virginia shrieks, hits ground)

1633
01:30:51,979 --> 01:30:53,347
- [West] Come on!

1634
01:30:53,347 --> 01:30:54,649
(zombies growling)

1635
01:30:55,750 --> 01:30:56,984
(West shrieking, hits ground)

1636
01:30:56,984 --> 01:30:58,519
Keep going!

1637
01:30:59,220 --> 01:31:01,389
- [Frisco] Quit falling down!
 (speech drowned out by music)

1638
01:31:01,389 --> 01:31:04,125
(Idaho hits ground) Let's go!

1639
01:31:04,125 --> 01:31:05,793
Careful!
- [Idaho] Okay.

1640
01:31:05,793 --> 01:31:07,128
(Frisco hits ground)

1641
01:31:11,933 --> 01:31:13,468
In there!

1642
01:31:14,969 --> 01:31:16,304
(cocks gun)

1643
01:31:20,074 --> 01:31:21,476
(places knife block)

1644
01:31:21,476 --> 01:31:22,910
- [Virginia] You wanna
   sit here in a strip club,

1645
01:31:22,910 --> 01:31:24,645
are you serious?
  - You have any better ideas?

1646
01:31:24,645 --> 01:31:27,248
At least, now we can
lock and bolt the door.

1647
01:31:30,084 --> 01:31:32,119
(heavy metal)

1648
01:31:32,119 --> 01:31:34,355
(zombies growling)

1649
01:31:34,355 --> 01:31:35,723

(shotgun blast)

1656
01:32:08,256 --> 01:32:09,523
(reloading) - [West] We
can't hold 'em off here.

1657
01:32:09,523 --> 01:32:11,092
Get behind the counter!

1658
01:32:11,092 --> 01:32:13,628
(stabbing, zombie choking)

1659
01:32:17,398 --> 01:32:20,401
(slicing, splattering)

1660
01:32:28,476 --> 01:32:30,144
- We can't keep
  this up much longer.

1661
01:32:30,144 --> 01:32:31,812
I'm out of ammo,
   what do we do now?

1662
01:32:31,812 --> 01:32:33,214
- I dunno, we need a plan.

1663
01:32:33,214 --> 01:32:34,849
We need something; should
   I start dancing again?

1664
01:32:34,849 --> 01:32:36,250
- Don't think that it'll help.

1665
01:32:36,250 --> 01:32:38,653
- [Idaho] This is it, guys.
  - Everything is fucked!

1666
01:32:38,653 --> 01:32:40,955
- Everything is fucked.

1667
01:32:40,955 --> 01:32:43,291
- [Dad] Use it, use
 it when everything's-

1668
01:32:43,291 --> 01:32:46,994
(cries out in pain) when
everything is fucked!

1669
01:32:48,562 --> 01:32:50,464
- [Idaho] Everything
  is not fucked.

1670
01:32:50,464 --> 01:32:51,566
- [Virginia] What?

1671
01:32:51,566 --> 01:32:52,967
- [Idaho] The briefcase!

1672
01:32:54,068 --> 01:32:55,403
(slams briefcase on table)

1673
01:32:55,403 --> 01:32:56,604
(ethereal choir music)

1674
01:32:56,604 --> 01:32:57,939
(pops clasp)

1675
01:33:00,274 --> 01:33:02,143
- [Frisco] Is it a gun?
- A knife?

1676
01:33:02,143 --> 01:33:06,013
- No, it's better.
   - What the hell?

1677
01:33:06,013 --> 01:33:10,318
Rule#1: Strippers dance
   for tips, and tips alone.

1678
01:33:10,318 --> 01:33:12,920
(hip hop music)

1679
01:33:17,425 --> 01:33:19,360
(zombies growling)

1680
01:33:52,960 --> 01:33:54,895
- Why won't they leave?

1681
01:33:54,895 --> 01:33:58,366
- [Idaho] Rule #2: Strippers
  are all about the cash.

1682
01:33:58,366 --> 01:34:00,134
(typewriter dings) They're
   never gonna get tired.

1683
01:34:00,134 --> 01:34:01,869
- [Virginia] We're gonna
   have to make a run for it,

1684
01:34:01,869 --> 01:34:03,037
Soon.
  - [Frisco] We won't

1685
01:34:03,037 --> 01:34:04,472
get very far.
 - [Idaho] C'mon, guys.

1686
01:34:04,472 --> 01:34:07,274
We have to try,
  we've come this far.

1687
01:34:07,274 --> 01:34:08,676
Damn it, I mean it!

1688
01:34:08,676 --> 01:34:11,345
We have to make a run
 for it while we can.

1689
01:34:11,345 --> 01:34:13,247
- He's right, we have to try.

1690
01:34:14,181 --> 01:34:15,316
- Okay, kid.

1691
01:34:17,651 --> 01:34:19,854
We're in this together.

1692
01:34:19,854 --> 01:34:22,023
- We go, on three.
   - [Virginia] Wait!

1693
01:34:22,023 --> 01:34:24,959
Is it, we go one, two,
 three, and then go,

1694
01:34:24,959 --> 01:34:27,028
or is it one, two, and
 then we go on three?

1695
01:34:27,028 --> 01:34:28,763
- We go, on three.

1696
01:34:28,763 --> 01:34:30,197
Ready?

1697
01:34:30,197 --> 01:34:32,500
Alright, we go one...

1698
01:34:34,502 --> 01:34:35,536
Two...

1699
01:34:36,637 --> 01:34:38,139
Three!

1700
01:34:41,308 --> 01:34:43,010
- [Grandbo] Get down!

1701
01:34:44,045 --> 01:34:46,347
(orchestral brass music)

1702
01:34:48,149 --> 01:34:49,717
- It's Grandbo!

1703
01:34:49,717 --> 01:34:51,819
- [Grandbo] The kick-ass begins,

1704
01:34:51,819 --> 01:34:55,923
when I finish my fine cigar.

1705
01:34:57,058 --> 01:34:59,093
Done! (zombies growl)

1706
01:34:59,093 --> 01:35:01,796
(machine gun fire)

1707
01:35:03,697 --> 01:35:05,166
Forward!

1708
01:35:05,166 --> 01:35:08,035
(mob yelling)

1709
01:35:09,470 --> 01:35:11,505
(glass breaking)

1710
01:35:14,675 --> 01:35:16,744
- [Old lady] Dance
  to this, you bitch!

1711
01:35:16,744 --> 01:35:18,212
(slicing, splattering)

1712
01:35:19,313 --> 01:35:21,949
- [Golf lady] That's not
a rack, this is a rack!

1713
01:35:22,783 --> 01:35:26,520
(hitting balls, splattering)

1714
01:35:29,857 --> 01:35:31,959
- [Old lady with
rolling pin] Batter up!

1715
01:35:31,959 --> 01:35:34,095
(rolling pin hits zombie)

1716
01:35:35,362 --> 01:35:37,698
- [Harriet] I've been
  saving this for a rainy day!

1717
01:35:37,698 --> 01:35:39,767
(slicing)

1718
01:35:39,767 --> 01:35:42,169
(hitting zombie, laughing)

1719
01:35:42,169 --> 01:35:46,073
(zombie hissing) - [Man] One
little titty, two little titty,

1720
01:35:46,073 --> 01:35:47,374
three little titty...

1721
01:35:50,344 --> 01:35:52,580
(explosion)

1722
01:36:00,254 --> 01:36:02,556
(distant gunfire)

1723
01:36:06,427 --> 01:36:10,264
(voice from walkie talkie)
  - Yes Trow, what do you got?

1724
01:36:10,264 --> 01:36:13,501
(gunshots, muffled
 walkie talkie speech)

1725
01:36:13,501 --> 01:36:17,438
Oh, good! We'll be done
and mopped up in 10.

1726
01:36:17,438 --> 01:36:20,174
Oh, man, I taught you guys well!

1727
01:36:20,174 --> 01:36:22,309
Yeah, cool! (all three laughing)

1728
01:36:22,309 --> 01:36:24,245
- [Frisco] Uh, miss...
 - Grandbo.

1729
01:36:24,245 --> 01:36:26,780
- How'd you know how to find us?

1730
01:36:26,780 --> 01:36:28,582
- [Grandbo] I knew my
 girls would make it.

1731
01:36:28,582 --> 01:36:31,552
So I kept spotters
 out there on the road.

1732
01:36:31,552 --> 01:36:33,287
We were a little
  late because Harriet

1733
01:36:33,287 --> 01:36:35,222
was in the middle of bowling.
 - [Harriet] Yeah,

1734
01:36:35,222 --> 01:36:36,624
my fault, sorry!

1735
01:36:37,391 --> 01:36:39,793
- Plus, half of these
 geezers, well they can't even

1736
01:36:39,793 --> 01:36:43,230
hear the alarm, and
  they have to get up.

1737
01:36:43,230 --> 01:36:46,534
and put on their
  analgesic, and well,

1738
01:36:46,534 --> 01:36:50,004
there's also some protective
  gear they have to bring.

1739
01:36:50,004 --> 01:36:52,206
Kinda private.

1740
01:36:52,206 --> 01:36:53,440
- [Idaho] But how
   did you survive?

1741
01:36:53,440 --> 01:36:54,808
I heard there was no-
 - [Grandbo] Since we

1742
01:36:54,808 --> 01:36:57,244
were by the coast, the
  virus was slow to get here.

1743
01:36:57,244 --> 01:36:59,613
The cities, they
were just chaos!

1744
01:36:59,613 --> 01:37:03,484
All the young people, they
   just packed up, and left.

1745
01:37:03,484 --> 01:37:05,753
Undisciplined, stupid.

1746
01:37:05,753 --> 01:37:10,391
But, I trained my whole
life as a sex weapon.

1747
01:37:10,391 --> 01:37:14,228
So, you know, I know
  why we were losing.

1748
01:37:14,228 --> 01:37:16,430
It was their bodies,
  their dancing.

1749
01:37:16,430 --> 01:37:18,365
Everybody was so distracted

1750
01:37:18,365 --> 01:37:20,167
they couldn't even
   think straight.

1751
01:37:20,167 --> 01:37:22,703
- Dude, GILF.
 - What?

1752
01:37:22,703 --> 01:37:24,104
- [Grandbo] So we
 expanded our perimeter

1753
01:37:24,104 --> 01:37:26,140
to handle the whole town.

1754
01:37:26,140 --> 01:37:28,742
We're takin' them
  out by the bunches.

1755
01:37:28,742 --> 01:37:31,312
- [Idaho] GILF!
   - What the fuck is a GILF?

1756
01:37:31,312 --> 01:37:34,114
(punches arm) - [Idaho] Ow!

1757
01:37:38,118 --> 01:37:40,054
We're finished with
  those skanks, sir.

1758
01:37:40,054 --> 01:37:42,022
We should be ready
   to roll in 15.

1759
01:37:42,022 --> 01:37:47,027
- Good. The Earlybird Special
 is on me tonight then!

1760
01:37:47,261 --> 01:37:49,196
(Grandbo and West laughing)

1761
01:37:49,263 --> 01:37:51,265
(waves crashing, bright music)

1762
01:37:52,866 --> 01:37:54,935
- [Idaho] If you would've
   told me a month ago,

1763
01:37:54,935 --> 01:37:57,838
that strippers would be after
 me, and that I would've been

1764
01:37:57,838 --> 01:38:01,508
running from them, and that
 I'd travel across the country

1765
01:38:01,508 --> 01:38:05,179
with some kind of gay
   super-cowboy, or roll with

1766
01:38:05,179 --> 01:38:09,550
a machete-wielding killing
machine, and I'd get the girl...

1767
01:38:09,550 --> 01:38:13,654
Well (chuckling) that couldn't
 even happen in a movie.

1768
01:38:13,654 --> 01:38:17,758
(fork scraping, Frisco eating)

1769
01:38:18,993 --> 01:38:22,329
- Grandbo, mm, I love you.

1770
01:38:22,329 --> 01:38:25,266
- Aww, I'm so happy to
 hear that, princess.

1771
01:38:25,266 --> 01:38:26,433
(oven dinging)

1772
01:38:26,433 --> 01:38:28,035
Now, you make sure
   you try my pie.

1773
01:38:29,503 --> 01:38:31,338
- Fine, alright.

1774
01:38:32,206 --> 01:38:34,241
- [Grandbo] Now
   remember, you kids

1775
01:38:34,241 --> 01:38:36,543
are safe here, we've
  swept the area.

1776
01:38:36,543 --> 01:38:39,847
There is more than
  enough food, power,

1777
01:38:39,847 --> 01:38:42,916
we've even reached some
people on the shortwave.

1778
01:38:42,916 --> 01:38:45,753
And soon, we're
   going to rebuild.

1779
01:38:45,753 --> 01:38:48,722
- Great, great! Mm.

1780
01:38:48,722 --> 01:38:50,224
(dog barking)

1781
01:38:50,224 --> 01:38:51,525
- [Idaho] It's ironic, isn't it?

1782
01:38:51,525 --> 01:38:52,960
- [Virginia] What?

1783
01:38:52,960 --> 01:38:54,161
- [Idaho] I always wanted
  a stripper as a girlfriend,

1784
01:38:54,161 --> 01:38:56,430
but I never met one,
  not one that would

1785
01:38:56,430 --> 01:38:58,465
talk to me once the
money ran out at least.

1786
01:38:58,465 --> 01:38:59,500
- [Virginia] Well,
   you're very lucky.

1787
01:38:59,500 --> 01:39:00,668
- [Idaho] I know, right?

1788
01:39:00,668 --> 01:39:02,002
I found the last
   stripper on Earth,

1789
01:39:02,002 --> 01:39:04,004
the last uninfected
  stripper on Earth,

1790
01:39:04,004 --> 01:39:05,773
and I didn't even know
 she was a stripper.

1791
01:39:05,773 --> 01:39:07,107
- Yep.

1792
01:39:07,107 --> 01:39:09,143
- [Idaho] That makes me,
the luckiest man alive.

1793
01:39:10,477 --> 01:39:12,946
- [Virginia] Yeah, you
   know, it's gonna cost you.

1794
01:39:12,946 --> 01:39:15,149
I don't come cheap.
  - Oh, I think

1795
01:39:15,149 --> 01:39:17,384
I have something you
might be interested in.

1796
01:39:17,384 --> 01:39:19,820
General Washington.
  (Virginia laughs)

1797
01:39:20,921 --> 01:39:24,291
("Stripperland"
   by Western Aerial)

1798
01:42:18,198 --> 01:42:21,869
("Club Life" by Double D)

1799
01:43:14,555 --> 01:43:16,390
(sped-up laughter)

1800
01:43:18,992 --> 01:43:21,461
