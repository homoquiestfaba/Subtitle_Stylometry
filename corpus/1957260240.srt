to come forward now?

1086
01:23:34,052 --> 01:23:34,966
Sleep.

1087
01:23:35,923 --> 01:23:36,837
Sleep?

1088
01:23:40,232 --> 01:23:43,627
I haven't had a really
good night's sleep

1089
01:23:43,757 --> 01:23:45,194
since I was 11 years old.

1090
01:23:47,326 --> 01:23:49,285
Those images,
they never left me.

1091
01:23:52,114 --> 01:23:53,593
Maybe now they will.

1092
01:23:56,161 --> 01:24:03,473
She was lovely, you know,
your mother.

1093
01:24:04,952 --> 01:24:08,521
But there just wasn't
any other way.

1094
01:24:10,175 --> 01:24:14,745
In business, you often have to
do more, go further, be bold

1095
01:24:14,875 --> 01:24:18,836
in ways which you might
never have imagined.

1096
01:24:18,966 --> 01:24:23,710
It's that very boldness
that has provided me this life.

1097
01:24:25,408 --> 01:24:29,194
I'd like to think that I passed
that boldness along to you.

1098
01:24:32,328 --> 01:24:33,633
Maybe you did.

1099
01:24:33,764 --> 01:24:34,765
MARTIN:
Good.

1100
01:24:35,853 --> 01:24:39,509
All I ask is that you,
at least, try to think about it

1101
01:24:39,639 --> 01:24:44,035
from my side, Sarah.

1102
01:24:44,166 --> 01:24:54,089
[♪♪♪]

1103
01:25:17,242 --> 01:25:18,069
It's yours now.

1104
01:25:32,214 --> 01:25:35,565
Wait till I get back to the car,
then you can take it,

1105
01:25:35,695 --> 01:25:37,044
put the bag in its place.

1106
01:25:50,493 --> 01:25:54,497
You know, for most people,
doing what you did,

1107
01:25:56,412 --> 01:25:58,240
living would be worse
than dying.

1108
01:25:58,370 --> 01:25:59,937
[Laughs]

1109
01:26:00,067 --> 01:26:01,199
For most people?

1110
01:26:04,028 --> 01:26:04,942
Perhaps.

1111
01:26:06,378 --> 01:26:07,858
Consider this a favor.

[Birds cawing in distance]

1116
01:26:49,247 --> 01:26:50,161
We're good?

1117
01:27:04,262 --> 01:27:05,176
You and me?

1118
01:27:28,982 --> 01:27:30,680
