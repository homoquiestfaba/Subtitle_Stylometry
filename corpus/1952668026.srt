1
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,312
What about the Angels, Nick?

2
00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:30,986
You like the Angels?

3
00:01:32,792 --> 00:01:33,759
Nick!

4
00:01:34,027 --> 00:01:34,925
Huh?

5
00:01:36,463 --> 00:01:37,452
What?

6
00:01:37,697 --> 00:01:39,028
The Angels?

7
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:41,531
Oh, I hate the fuckin' Angels.

8
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:44,999
Every time I think they're gonna do
somethin' they do the exact opposite.

9
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:47,239
An inconsistent group of people.

10
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:49,503
The Padres I got in my pocket.

11
00:01:49,642 --> 00:01:50,734
They're always the same.

12
00:01:50,877 --> 00:01:52,139
They suck.

13
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,477
You got anything, Yoyo?

14
00:01:55,882 --> 00:01:58,146
But to what degree do they suck?

15
00:01:58,351 --> 00:01:59,750
I mean, there are many different levels

16
00:01:59,886 --> 00:02:02,855
Have you got anything for
my fucking head, Yoyo?

17
00:02:03,022 --> 00:02:05,183
Anything of a pharmaceutical nature?

18
00:02:05,592 --> 00:02:08,288
I'm not carrying that sort of
item anymore, Nicky.

19
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:11,692
Talk to Stavros.

20
00:02:12,098 --> 00:02:15,727
If I buy from Stavros,
then I bet with Stavros.

21
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:16,995
Hey, look!

22
00:02:18,605 --> 00:02:19,799
I don't expect you guys to work,

23
00:02:19,939 --> 00:02:22,407
but could you park your butts
somewheres out of the way?

24
00:02:22,609 --> 00:02:24,236
We got equipment moving through here.

25
00:02:24,711 --> 00:02:27,077
You know what my head feels like today,
Riggs?

26
00:02:27,213 --> 00:02:28,737
Oh, you want to take a sick day, Nicky?

27
00:02:28,915 --> 00:02:30,075
Be my guest.

28
00:02:30,917 --> 00:02:33,784
If you don't want me here,
why don't you just fire me?

29
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:35,852
'Cause I can't fire you.

30
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:37,920
You mean you don't have the balls to
fire me.

31
00:02:38,057 --> 00:02:39,251
No, it's out of respect for your father

32
00:02:39,392 --> 00:02:41,860
Who you don't have the balls to
stand up to.

33
00:02:42,362 --> 00:02:42,794
Ehh.

34
00:02:42,929 --> 00:02:44,362
Fuckin' Riggs, I swear.

35
00:02:44,764 --> 00:02:45,924
You won't fire me?

36
00:02:46,065 --> 00:02:47,191
I quit.

37
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,799
Don't put it that way, Nicky.

38
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:50,128
As your union representative, I--

39
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:51,531
That's it, I fuckin' quit.

40
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:52,865
I'm outta here.

41
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:55,764
You're not really gonna bet
with Stavros, are you, Nick?

42
00:02:56,042 --> 00:02:57,475
The guy's a fuckin' pirate.

43
00:02:59,445 --> 00:03:00,969
He'll throw those Greek odds at you,
Nicky!

44
00:03:01,147 --> 00:03:03,980
Look, I'm sure you've got some people
who can handle the job

45
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:05,610
but my hands are tied, you know.

46
00:03:05,752 --> 00:03:07,014
I deal with the union.

47
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:09,622
You go find Yoyo, he's the shop steward
on this job.

48
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:11,450
I already talked to the man over him.

49
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:12,487
What?

50
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:13,592
What, Belcher at the Local?

51
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,249
Yeah.

52
00:03:14,427 --> 00:03:15,121
What did he say?

53
00:03:15,261 --> 00:03:16,023
He said talk to you.

54
00:03:16,162 --> 00:03:18,187
That if you made a stand,
then maybe his membership would accept.

55
00:03:18,798 --> 00:03:19,958
Right.

56
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,597
What that means is his guys walk
for two weeks

57
00:03:23,736 --> 00:03:26,671
till I kiss their ass and
hand them all kinds of concessions.

58
00:03:26,806 --> 00:03:30,799
Then maybe...maybe they'll take in
a handful of your people.

59
00:03:31,077 --> 00:03:33,841
On top of them, which I already got
on the job.

60
00:03:34,013 --> 00:03:38,143
Which includes four, five guys
who only sit and read the paper all day

61
00:03:38,518 --> 00:03:40,645
Hey...I made a bid on this job.

62
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:41,981
You're saying no.

63
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:44,113
Maybe some other job, all right?

64
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:45,348
Something for the city.

65
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:46,957
But not on this one.

66
00:03:47,193 --> 00:03:48,683
I'm out on a limb on this one!

67
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:52,592
I mean, there's no way I can bring your
people on and still make my bid.

68
00:03:52,932 --> 00:03:54,194
Heeey, what's he doin'?

69
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:55,265
Ho! Nicky?

70
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:56,800
So we're good enough to pay rent on
these apartments,

71
00:03:56,936 --> 00:03:57,925
but we're not good enough to build them

72
00:03:58,104 --> 00:03:58,968
No-- Excuse me.

73
00:03:59,205 --> 00:03:59,899
Riggs!

74
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:00,539
Yo!

75
00:04:00,673 --> 00:04:01,332
Where the hell's Nicky goin'?

76
00:04:01,474 --> 00:04:02,668
He says he's quittin'.

77
00:04:03,543 --> 00:04:04,567
That--

78
00:04:12,151 --> 00:04:13,482
Stavros!

79
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:14,845
Late breakfast?

80
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:16,215
I need some crank.

81
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:17,855
What am I, a drugstore?

82
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:21,984
Stavros, look--
You are a fuckin' drugstore.

83
00:04:22,161 --> 00:04:23,822
Now I need enough for a day or two.

84
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:25,358
Did you have anything to eat today?

85
00:04:25,498 --> 00:04:28,763
I got juices, I got papaya drink,
Yoo-Hoo.

86
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:30,232
Coke, Stavros.

87
00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:31,631
Papaya drink is good.

88
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:32,669
It's ten percent real juice.

89
00:04:32,805 --> 00:04:34,204
Just give me the fuckin drugs,
will you?!

90
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,638
Yo, Nicky, you havin' breakfast
or scoring coke?

91
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:37,674
Hey!

92
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:39,774
Tell the whole world, why don't you?

93
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:41,608
You better be buying drugs.

94
00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:42,976
Breakfast here'll kill you.

95
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:44,583
You want a beer, Nick?

96
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:45,718
Sounds good.

97
00:04:46,185 --> 00:04:47,516
What, are you playin' hookey?

98
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:48,412
I quit.

99
00:04:48,554 --> 00:04:49,248
All right!

100
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:50,048
Whoo!

101
00:04:50,189 --> 00:04:51,554
Hey, Nick, you owe me.

102
00:04:52,191 --> 00:04:53,215
Put it on my tab.

103
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:54,155
You don't have a tab.

104
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,227
Start one.

105
00:04:58,898 --> 00:04:59,990
Whoo!

106
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,662
Later!

107
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,150
You know who that is?

108
00:05:29,595 --> 00:05:33,429
She is married to the Assistant to
the District Attorney.

109
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,031
Little shit name of Zimmer.

110
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:36,294
They got a beautiful car.

111
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:37,800
I used to fuck her.

112
00:05:38,037 --> 00:05:38,731
Really?

113
00:05:38,871 --> 00:05:41,772
Yeah, really! High school.

114
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:44,409
Yvonne Plasky.

115
00:05:44,777 --> 00:05:48,008
I bet she shit a brick when she saw
where the hook brung her car.

116
00:05:48,147 --> 00:05:49,273
Oh, she's gonna turn this way!

117
00:05:49,415 --> 00:05:52,282
You guys, when she turns
I'm gonna point at her --

118
00:05:52,418 --> 00:05:54,079
you laugh like I'm tellin' you
something really hot about her.

119
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:58,982
All right.

120
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:01,958
Vinnie, go sit in the front seat and,
uh, eat your breakfast.

121
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:04,723
But, Carl...I'm all dirty.

122
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:06,388
That's the point, dipshit.

123
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:07,123
Move it.

124
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,665
If she wants to know is her car done,

125
00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:11,599
tell her you gotta ask me
only you're on your break now.

126
00:06:11,971 --> 00:06:13,165
Go!

127
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:14,764
What are you laughin' at, Turkey?

128
00:06:14,941 --> 00:06:16,408
Get back on that Buick.

129
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:17,031
Yo, Turk!

130
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,336
Steal any good cars lately?

131
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:19,944
All right, you two.

132
00:06:20,313 --> 00:06:21,337
Business.

133
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:24,648
Tonight's the night.

134
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:25,876
We just need the wheels, Carl.

135
00:06:26,018 --> 00:06:27,076
They still available?

136
00:06:28,187 --> 00:06:30,052
Is that asshole in on it?

137
00:06:31,357 --> 00:06:32,722
Not so far,

138
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:33,826
You got a problem with Nick?

139
00:06:33,993 --> 00:06:35,824
I got a problem with
his whole fuckin' family.

140
00:06:35,962 --> 00:06:37,054
What's he doin' outta work?

141
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:40,927
He's the only fuck I know stupid enough
to quit a no-show job.

142
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:42,456
All right.

143
00:06:42,702 --> 00:06:44,670
You keep this one on a leash.

144
00:06:44,804 --> 00:06:45,771
Vinnie's got the keys.

145
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:46,667
Yo, Vinnie!

146
00:06:46,806 --> 00:06:48,797
When we're on the job, we're cold, man.

147
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:50,772
Uh, we are like icewater.

148
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:52,975
We're pros, dude.

149
00:06:53,312 --> 00:06:56,281
If you two fuck this thing up
and my name gets into it,

150
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:58,679
I'll have you converted
into building materials.

151
00:06:58,818 --> 00:07:00,046
You understand me?

152
00:07:00,787 --> 00:07:01,685
Vinnie!

153
00:07:01,821 --> 00:07:04,517
You fat fuckin' hemorrhoid,get in here!

154
00:07:08,027 --> 00:07:09,585
Professionals.

155
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:19,871
Hey, hey there, big and beautiful !

156
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:21,473
Don't start up with me, Levonne.

157
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:23,506
Hey, you know I finish what I start now.

158
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:28,179
You best reel that thing of yours back
in before somebody out here step on it.

159
00:07:28,381 --> 00:07:29,541
Go ahead.

160
00:07:29,982 --> 00:07:31,142
Levonne?

161
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:35,914
Well, now look who done come down off
the hill to mingle with us common folk.

162
00:07:36,088 --> 00:07:37,385
Professor Oreo.

163
00:07:37,523 --> 00:07:38,319
Yo, Malik!

164
00:07:38,424 --> 00:07:40,392
We got us a royal visit here.

165
00:07:40,526 --> 00:07:41,993
You on an errand for City Hall?

166
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:42,856
I wondered

167
00:07:42,995 --> 00:07:44,963
if you could help me get some people
down to the council meeting tonight.

168
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:46,189
There's a hond issue for the school.

169
00:07:46,365 --> 00:07:47,730
The white man's school.

170
00:07:48,167 --> 00:07:49,532
Our kids go to them.

171
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:51,296
You got no kids Wynn.

172
00:07:51,571 --> 00:07:53,766
Black people's children go to
those schools.

173
00:07:53,906 --> 00:07:55,498
Well now we talkin' about black people?

174
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:57,370
See, now you got to
get that shit clear, Wynn.

175
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:58,477
You playin' the white man's game.

176
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:00,134
Don't come down here lookin'
for suport, brother!

177
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:03,180
Look, look! There's not enought of us
in the city to fight amongst ourselves.

178
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:04,442
I have a little power on the Council--

179
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:05,812
You believe that?

180
00:08:06,452 --> 00:08:07,646
You got shit, Wynn.

181
00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:09,277
You got crumbs off
the white man's table.

182
00:08:09,455 --> 00:08:10,683
Look--!

183
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:16,994
I gotta run.

184
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:19,391
You don't have to back me or what I say

185
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,466
Just come tonight and bring some people
so they know we're still alive.

186
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:25,701
Nice of you to stop by, Wynn!

187
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,431
Don't be no stranger now!

188
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:32,604
Any luck?

189
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:34,310
Not with those two.

190
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:38,650
I'll hit the projects next.

191
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:47,489
Wynn...?

192
00:08:47,627 --> 00:08:48,150
Mm-hmm.

193
00:08:48,327 --> 00:08:50,090
Have you thought any more about
Franklin?

194
00:08:51,063 --> 00:08:52,530
What can I do for Franklin?

195
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:54,995
Well, you talk to people all day.

196
00:08:55,134 --> 00:08:57,034
Business people, shop owners...

197
00:08:57,169 --> 00:08:59,296
And you expect me to ask them for
a job for my brother-in-law?

198
00:08:59,438 --> 00:09:00,496
How's that gonna look?

199
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,239
They do it -- all the time.

200
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:05,071
But they are nepotistic sleazebags,
remember?

201
00:09:06,612 --> 00:09:07,738
Wynn, he's a black man.

202
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,507
He lives in your district.

203
00:09:09,682 --> 00:09:11,149
He's had some bad braks, but--

204
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:12,614
Grand theft is not a bad break!

205
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:13,912
Drop me off here.

206
00:09:21,193 --> 00:09:26,495
Look...I promise that if something
comes up for him,I'll do the best I can

207
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:29,290
That's all I'm asking.

208
00:09:29,468 --> 00:09:30,492
All right.

209
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:33,835
Hang tough.

210
00:09:33,973 --> 00:09:35,770
Yeah. You too, baby.

211
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:44,811
Mad Anthony again,
the lowest man in town.

212
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:46,646
And this time I've really gone off
the deep end.

213
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:49,152
Everything, and I mean everything on
our shelves

214
00:09:49,288 --> 00:09:51,882
has been marked down to
rock bottom prices.

215
00:09:52,024 --> 00:09:54,754
All your electronic and computer-age
needs under one roof...

216
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:59,121
We're here every day.

217
00:09:59,298 --> 00:10:00,788
We see what happens here.

218
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:02,229
It's the Spanish.

219
00:10:02,368 --> 00:10:04,336
It hasn't been the same
since they showed up.

220
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:07,439
They make this noise with their teeth,
this sucking noise...

221
00:10:07,573 --> 00:10:09,234
I was raised on this block.

222
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:10,740
Now I wouldn't walk here alone.

223
00:10:10,876 --> 00:10:12,309
I'm a married woman with children!

224
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:13,469
Means nothing to them.

225
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:15,079
And these people out on the street!

226
00:10:15,214 --> 00:10:17,705
You walk past your door,
it's a friggin' lunatic asylum!

227
00:10:17,883 --> 00:10:20,010
Needles in the sandboxes in the park!

228
00:10:20,152 --> 00:10:21,119
These crack vials...

229
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:22,311
No respect.

230
00:10:22,488 --> 00:10:24,149
No sense of responsibility.

231
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:24,984
It's the welfare.

232
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:26,022
I mean, why work?

233
00:10:26,158 --> 00:10:27,284
The government takes care of you.

234
00:10:27,426 --> 00:10:30,327
Well, I used to feel bad for the kids,
but they're the worst.

235
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:32,363
Thirteen years old with a baby on
their hip.

236
00:10:32,498 --> 00:10:33,465
Do you ladies have a complaint?

237
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,122
Complaint?

238
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,267
Have you been listening?

239
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:37,028
A specific complaint.

240
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:38,736
A criminal charge.

241
00:10:38,904 --> 00:10:39,598
See, Connie?

242
00:10:39,772 --> 00:10:40,602
They don't care.

243
00:10:40,773 --> 00:10:41,671
They don't care!

244
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:45,709
You gotta be bang-raped and roasted at
the stake before they'll lift a finger.

245
00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:47,335
If they were your kids out here
on the street,

246
00:10:47,513 --> 00:10:50,607
you wouldn't be sittin' on
your ass doin' nothin' !

247
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:52,351
Look at this!

248
00:10:52,618 --> 00:10:54,279
There's your tax money right there!

249
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,444
Why do we bother?!

250
00:10:55,621 --> 00:10:57,088
Jesus fuckin' Christ.

251
00:10:57,723 --> 00:10:58,849
In stereo.

252
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:00,788
The skinny one's like
my mother's cousin.

253
00:11:00,926 --> 00:11:02,257
A bitch on wheels.

254
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:06,024
they got a point maybe,
but it ain't our fault.

255
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:08,365
I'm gonna drive by DeLillo's.

256
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:09,297
Will you quit with that?

257
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:09,901
It's over.

258
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:10,535
Never.

259
00:11:10,703 --> 00:11:12,261
I'm not givin' up on it, all right?

260
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:16,899
Oh, just what I need.

261
00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:18,043
O'Brien.

262
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:21,172
'Morning, fellas.

263
00:11:21,313 --> 00:11:21,836
Bill.

264
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:24,244
You goin' to the Mayor's dinner on
Friday night?

265
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,240
What, at a hundred bucks a pop?

266
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:27,181
Forget it.

267
00:11:27,319 --> 00:11:29,184
But I'll see you there, won't I, Mike?

268
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:29,650
Huh?

269
00:11:29,822 --> 00:11:30,379
Yeah.

270
00:11:30,556 --> 00:11:32,319
Take these, push 'em around to
people on your beat.

271
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:34,426
You make that kid Ramirez,
you run him in.

272
00:11:34,593 --> 00:11:35,821
We ran him in yesterday.

273
00:11:35,961 --> 00:11:36,723
Bring him in again.

274
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:37,521
What for?

275
00:11:37,663 --> 00:11:40,131
Suspicion of being on my shit list.

276
00:11:40,599 --> 00:11:42,157
Make it a priority, Tommy.

277
00:11:42,401 --> 00:11:44,460
Oh! Have a good one.

278
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:50,736
What's your problem with O'Brien?

279
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:52,104
He's an asswipe.

280
00:11:52,244 --> 00:11:52,938
So?

281
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:55,946
So he ain't a detective,
he's a fuckin' politician.

282
00:11:56,082 --> 00:11:57,413
Everybody's a politician.

283
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,107
Yeah?

284
00:11:58,284 --> 00:11:59,114
I'm not.

285
00:11:59,251 --> 00:12:01,685
Why do you think I'm still
in uniform at my age?

286
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:03,118
'Cause you're stupid.

287
00:12:03,255 --> 00:12:04,688
Right.

288
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:07,821
'Cause I don't back to
the pols every time I turn around.

289
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:09,659
A hundred bucks a pop.

290
00:12:09,795 --> 00:12:10,921
Christ!

291
00:12:12,031 --> 00:12:13,658
I wonder if she's workin' today.

292
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:15,196
Hey, forget about her, kid.

293
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:16,392
She's history.

294
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:20,768
I don't know,
maybe you should start small, Nick.

295
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:22,897
Open up a lunch wagon next to Stavros.

296
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:24,702
Yeah, Nicky's Food-O-Rama.

297
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:28,209
A restaurant's gotta have personality.

298
00:12:28,347 --> 00:12:30,008
And very hot waitresses.

299
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:31,416
Yeah.

300
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:32,778
That can be part of it.

301
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:33,775
I'm sorry I'm late.

302
00:12:33,953 --> 00:12:34,783
I had a class.

303
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,217
You have people on six and nine.

304
00:12:36,355 --> 00:12:37,049
I started them for you.

305
00:12:37,189 --> 00:12:37,917
All right.

306
00:12:38,524 --> 00:12:39,991
Good seein' you folks again.

307
00:12:40,126 --> 00:12:42,287
I'm sure Larry can iron out
all the details with you.

308
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:43,190
Take it easy, Alex.

309
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:44,159
Take care.

310
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:45,856
I'll send your waitress right over.

311
00:12:45,998 --> 00:12:46,965
Thanks, doll.

312
00:12:49,401 --> 00:12:51,699
So...what are these details?

313
00:12:52,004 --> 00:12:53,733
He talked about racquetball.

314
00:12:54,006 --> 00:12:56,167
The District Attorney would be happy
to have your backin,

315
00:12:56,308 --> 00:12:58,776
but we need to get more specific
about the parameters.

316
00:12:58,978 --> 00:13:00,946
We're discussing certain properties on
L Street.

317
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:02,740
I recall the previous conversation.

318
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:06,346
L street has to come down for
Galaxy Towers to go up.

319
00:13:06,752 --> 00:13:09,220
If those buildings aren't clear
in a week,

320
00:13:09,555 --> 00:13:13,286
the New York money walks, the Japanese
walk -- the whole thing falls apart.

321
00:13:13,692 --> 00:13:16,923
If we get past that, we'll both need
major juice on the Development Package

322
00:13:17,062 --> 00:13:18,529
when it comes up at council.

323
00:13:18,864 --> 00:13:20,695
He's the District Attorney, fellas.

324
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:22,263
This stuff's all municipal.

325
00:13:22,401 --> 00:13:23,299
Who's municipal?

326
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:24,968
This comes down from Baci.

327
00:13:25,204 --> 00:13:27,468
The second most indictable Mayor in
the state.

328
00:13:27,773 --> 00:13:29,832
You must have a file like a phone book
on the guy.

329
00:13:30,042 --> 00:13:32,306
The District Attorney is very concerned
about municipal corruption,

330
00:13:32,444 --> 00:13:34,639
but to take on a machine like Baci's --

331
00:13:36,615 --> 00:13:38,549
I'm just not sure
what the incentive would be.

332
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:58,167
If you man tries for the Senate next
year, he'll need a lot of resources.

333
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:01,828
Any effort on his part to improve
the climate in this city...

334
00:14:09,748 --> 00:14:13,377
We're moving mountains here, fellas...
and you give me a week.

335
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,283
But we're always interested in support
from the business sector.

336
00:14:23,062 --> 00:14:24,689
I think you can count on us.

337
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:27,223
Hi !

338
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,567
I'm Angela.

339
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:31,526
You gentlemen know what you want?

340
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:34,201
--everything, and I mean everything
on our shelves

341
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,834
has been marked down to
rock bottom prices!

342
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:39,341
You want me to give your program
free computers.

343
00:14:39,478 --> 00:14:42,447
You understand I don't get them free
from the manufacturer.

344
00:14:42,581 --> 00:14:44,549
The program isn't funded to
make purchases of more than--

345
00:14:44,683 --> 00:14:46,583
If these are people without money,

346
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,744
then they're not likely to
be my customers, right?

347
00:14:48,921 --> 00:14:50,752
Look, you're a member of the community.

348
00:14:50,856 --> 00:14:51,788
You do business here.

349
00:14:51,924 --> 00:14:53,289
You hire local people.

350
00:14:53,592 --> 00:14:55,822
I wish I could hire local people.

351
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:58,290
I haven't had a night watchman for
two weeks.

352
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:00,998
You advertise for minimum wage,
you know who shows up?

353
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:02,197
Deviants show up.

354
00:15:02,334 --> 00:15:05,326
Uh...mentally disturbed people,
blind people--

355
00:15:05,504 --> 00:15:06,471
You need a security guard?

356
00:15:06,605 --> 00:15:07,537
You got someone?

357
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,604
Eh, I might.

358
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:09,605
Is it a friend of yours?

359
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:10,709
My wife's brother.

360
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:13,778
Gettin' the old freeze out, huh?

361
00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:15,843
No tickee, no nookie.

362
00:15:16,215 --> 00:15:17,045
Sure.

363
00:15:17,182 --> 00:15:18,581
Tell him to come on over.

364
00:15:18,717 --> 00:15:19,945
He's got a record.

365
00:15:20,886 --> 00:15:22,410
This one's the ultimate, man.

366
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,886
This one makes Nintendo look pathetic.

367
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:27,388
I-I've never played Nintendo.

368
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,524
Where you been raised, boy?

369
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,094
You got a TV, don't you?

370
00:15:33,032 --> 00:15:34,226
We got a TV.

371
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,128
And a VCR, right?

372
00:15:36,535 --> 00:15:37,502
No.

373
00:15:38,737 --> 00:15:40,136
Well, shit, man!

374
00:15:40,506 --> 00:15:42,269
Don't be invitin' me over to your house

375
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:45,571
watchin' some ol' Mister Rogers
network dog-dukey.

376
00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:47,008
Something else you need?

377
00:15:47,146 --> 00:15:49,114
Stereo, VCR, CD player.

378
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:50,145
Wha-, a dehumidifier!

379
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:50,771
Thank you, no.

380
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:52,383
But about Franklin, look,
you don't have to--

381
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:53,485
Hey, look.

382
00:15:53,652 --> 00:15:55,483
He paid his debt, right?

383
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:58,181
Look...you're my repreesentative on
the council.

384
00:15:58,357 --> 00:16:01,758
Someday I got a matter
that needs representing, Quid Pro Quo.

385
00:16:01,894 --> 00:16:02,690
Am I right?

386
00:16:02,828 --> 00:16:04,625
Bullshit, you haven't got a thing.

387
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:07,164
We've got the dumpster contract thing.

388
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:09,392
We've got the kickbacks on
the elderly lunch program.

389
00:16:09,568 --> 00:16:12,731
We've got eight major no-show
jobholders donating

390
00:16:12,871 --> 00:16:15,840
a full quarter of their generous
salaries to your political action fund.

391
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:16,633
He's just blowin' smoke, Mayor.

392
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,470
This is stuff that just fell into
our laps.

393
00:16:18,677 --> 00:16:20,736
I hate to think what a serious
investigation would turn up.

394
00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:22,210
So your guys want to bust my balls,huh?

395
00:16:22,348 --> 00:16:23,178
Sal !
Hi, Phil, how you doin'?

396
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:24,839
Not at all, Mister Mayor.

397
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:26,507
The District Attorney
is well aware that

398
00:16:26,685 --> 00:16:28,744
in municipal government
there are many grey areas.

399
00:16:28,921 --> 00:16:29,910
Mister Mayor!

400
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:32,284
Mrs. Spivak! Say hello to
your mother for me.

401
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:33,282
Good bless you!

402
00:16:33,459 --> 00:16:34,187
Good bless you!

403
00:16:35,561 --> 00:16:36,493
What does he want?

404
00:16:37,029 --> 00:16:38,929
The apartment buildings
we discussed before.

405
00:16:39,064 --> 00:16:40,053
On L street.

406
00:16:40,366 --> 00:16:41,526
He's your brother, Pauly.

407
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:42,361
What's up?

408
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:44,969
He's putting the usual pressure on,
but he won't go for the other thing.

409
00:16:45,104 --> 00:16:46,594
He won't go along with the other thing?

410
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,101
He's a virgin all of a sudden?

411
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,298
He forgets how he owns
these fuckin' buildings!

412
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:49,998
Gentlemen.

413
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:52,700
Gentlemen!

414
00:16:52,878 --> 00:16:54,277
This is a converstaion
I should not be hearing.

415
00:16:54,413 --> 00:16:58,247
All you need to understand is that
the success of the Development Package

416
00:16:58,384 --> 00:17:01,911
that's been proposed by certain very
good friends of the District Attorney

417
00:17:02,087 --> 00:17:04,419
has become essential to
your political future.

418
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:07,555
We're down to the wire on this, fellas.

419
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:08,785
We need results.

420
00:17:09,495 --> 00:17:11,690
I'll leave the details
in your capable hands.

421
00:17:13,732 --> 00:17:14,460
Larry!

422
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,089
Hey, Bill.

423
00:17:15,267 --> 00:17:16,757
This a social visit
or are we under arrest?

424
00:17:16,935 --> 00:17:17,867
Shhh.

425
00:17:18,003 --> 00:17:19,436
Hey, I hear your man's makin' a run
for the Senate.

426
00:17:19,571 --> 00:17:20,765
Ohh, only a rumor, Bill.

427
00:17:20,906 --> 00:17:21,463
Only a rumor.

428
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,572
If you need any help...

429
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:23,732
I'll keep that in mind.

430
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,208
I pay you what, forty-five grand a year
you can't even deliver your own brother

431
00:17:26,345 --> 00:17:27,107
Sal, I talked to him.

432
00:17:27,246 --> 00:17:27,803
Lean on him, Pauly!

433
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:28,446
With what?

434
00:17:28,614 --> 00:17:29,638
Joey's hooked up with Kerrigan now.

435
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:30,747
he's got his own thing going.

436
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:32,012
Yo, Gus.

437
00:17:32,184 --> 00:17:33,481
Hey, what'd they do,
close down the dog track?

438
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:35,348
No, they made a mistake
on my check here.

439
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:36,954
They left off the overtime.

440
00:17:37,156 --> 00:17:40,182
Well, if you don't put in time, Gus,
how can you put in overtime?

441
00:17:41,026 --> 00:17:42,857
I'd like to condemn your fuckin' house.

442
00:17:43,028 --> 00:17:44,427
Have a good one, pal !

443
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:45,989
Oh, man it's more than a guitar.

444
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:48,633
It's a pre-CBS Start with
a Kahler whammy,

445
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:51,031
single stacked coil, full MIDI rack kit

446
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:53,138
Mesa-Boogie amps
that are fuckin' cherry!

447
00:17:53,305 --> 00:17:56,672
Never been over 30 DB's--the guy played
like folk music on it or somethin'.

448
00:17:56,809 --> 00:17:58,470
Yo! This thing has no fingerprints
on it...

449
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:00,043
Man, you're suckin' it down today.

450
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,879
Nutrition.

451
00:18:03,115 --> 00:18:05,049
man cannot live by narcotics alone.

452
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:06,615
You should take it easy.

453
00:18:07,219 --> 00:18:08,914
I'm a free man today, Bobby.

454
00:18:09,788 --> 00:18:11,255
Shit is gonna happen.

455
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:13,152
Important stuff.

456
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:14,559
I can feel it!

457
00:18:14,726 --> 00:18:15,658
Right.

458
00:18:16,361 --> 00:18:19,888
Hey, it's Mister Goodwrench
and his faithful companion, Jim!

459
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:22,233
So what happened to the face, Jimmy?

460
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:24,936
Fuckin' boogs got him last night down
on M Street by the tracks.

461
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:25,661
Oooh.

462
00:18:25,838 --> 00:18:28,306
Say, for a small feel I'll hook you up
with some steroids.

463
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,873
Two weeks, you'll be beefed up
for a rematch.

464
00:18:30,008 --> 00:18:30,599
Fuck that shit!

465
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:32,300
We're goin' down there,
we're gonna kick some ass tonight.

466
00:18:32,478 --> 00:18:33,502
You guys want a piece or what?

467
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:35,738
Haven't I seen this on ''Wrestlemania''?

468
00:18:36,548 --> 00:18:37,606
Chickenshits.

469
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,876
Yeah, we'd love to help you out tonight
but we got a gig.

470
00:18:40,052 --> 00:18:40,916
This Bud's for you!

471
00:18:42,354 --> 00:18:43,548
What a dick, huh?

472
00:18:44,356 --> 00:18:45,414
What is he, nineteen?

473
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:46,387
Eighteen.

474
00:18:46,525 --> 00:18:47,822
He dropped out this year.

475
00:18:49,094 --> 00:18:51,085
That's how old my brother was
when he died.

476
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:56,824
Hey, uh, did he tell you about
the demo we're doin?

477
00:18:57,236 --> 00:18:58,601
Top of the line production, man.

478
00:18:58,737 --> 00:18:59,931
Twenty-four track.

479
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,165
Yeah, right.

480
00:19:02,374 --> 00:19:03,671
On whose nickel?

481
00:19:04,042 --> 00:19:07,478
Well...t-that was somethin' we wanted
to talk to you about, Nicky.

482
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:10,441
Carl is big time now, Nick.

483
00:19:10,582 --> 00:19:11,412
The guy is connected.

484
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:14,110
You know that warehouse fire took
down half the waterfront

485
00:19:14,286 --> 00:19:15,947
but no one got a scratch?

486
00:19:16,088 --> 00:19:17,055
That was Carl.

487
00:19:17,256 --> 00:19:18,587
He's not just a loan shark anymore.

488
00:19:18,724 --> 00:19:21,215
Look, we done a couple of things with
him turned out real good.

489
00:19:21,393 --> 00:19:21,882
Yeah.

490
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,027
And this is very serious money, Nick.

491
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:26,528
You know, with this one, we retire,
go back to the music full time.

492
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:29,292
We figured since you're our friend

493
00:19:29,468 --> 00:19:31,959
and you're not on the tit anymore,
well, if you want in...

494
00:19:32,137 --> 00:19:34,196
It's a Declaration of Independence.

495
00:19:34,373 --> 00:19:36,432
You know, eh, think of it as
''fuck you'' money.

496
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:39,506
Isn't there anybody you want to
say ''Fuck you!'' to?

497
00:19:46,151 --> 00:19:46,742
I'll be right out.

498
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:47,749
Ten minutes max.

499
00:19:47,886 --> 00:19:48,682
Yo.

500
00:20:05,737 --> 00:20:06,499
Hey, Nicky, how's it goin'?

501
00:20:06,638 --> 00:20:07,366
Just fine.

502
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:08,401
Good to see you.

503
00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:11,006
You're in big trouble, pal.

504
00:20:11,143 --> 00:20:11,734
Where's the old man?

505
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:12,968
He's in there with Uncle Pauly.

506
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:14,339
You really quit this time?

507
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:14,978
Yeah, yeah.

508
00:20:15,113 --> 00:20:15,807
Wh-Where's Mom?

509
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:18,516
She's in the kitchen supervising
the galley slaves.

510
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:20,282
Are you on something?

511
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:21,247
Come on, we gotta talk.

512
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:21,852
Nicky!

513
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,487
Hey, listen, you ditch me now

514
00:20:23,622 --> 00:20:25,419
and I tell Mom you spent the weekend
with a married man.

515
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:27,320
That was over a year ago.

516
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:31,695
If you don't come through,
the whole thing comes down on my head.

517
00:20:32,331 --> 00:20:34,629
Hey, I raised the rent to
the legal ceiling.

518
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,367
I had the heat off for
three weeks in March.

519
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:42,003
The buildings stink from garbage
I don't pick up.

520
00:20:42,274 --> 00:20:45,471
Pauly, these people are not leaving!

521
00:20:45,844 --> 00:20:47,402
They have nowhere to go.

522
00:20:47,946 --> 00:20:49,208
You know what you can do.

523
00:20:50,482 --> 00:20:51,540
No fuckin' way.

524
00:20:51,717 --> 00:20:53,241
Don't mention that again,
you understand me?

525
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:58,116
Look...have something to drink,will ya?

526
00:20:58,223 --> 00:20:59,383
I gotta find my kid.

527
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:01,425
Hey, Joe, you're gettin' skinny!

528
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,624
Yeah, right.

529
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:05,389
I'm on a steady diet of agida.

530
00:21:08,867 --> 00:21:10,767
So where did you learn how to
make ltalian food?

531
00:21:10,902 --> 00:21:16,602
Italian food, Jewish food,
Chinese food Yuppie food.

532
00:21:16,808 --> 00:21:17,331
Laurie.

533
00:21:17,509 --> 00:21:17,907
Hmm?

534
00:21:18,043 --> 00:21:18,737
Where is he?

535
00:21:18,877 --> 00:21:19,309
Nick?

536
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:19,967
Yeah.

537
00:21:20,145 --> 00:21:21,544
Umm, he went out with Mom.

538
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,908
I think they went out back.

539
00:21:23,181 --> 00:21:25,809
The only kind of food I don't make is
Japanese food.

540
00:21:26,351 --> 00:21:28,683
Those people eat some strange things.

541
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:32,616
Nick, I will never say no to you but
I'm not going behind your father's back

542
00:21:33,392 --> 00:21:36,327
Now, you go to him, have it out,
whatever, then come to me.

543
00:21:36,528 --> 00:21:38,086
Okay, okay, I'll talk to him.

544
00:21:38,263 --> 00:21:38,820
First.

545
00:21:38,997 --> 00:21:41,227
You talk to him first,
then you come to me for money.

546
00:21:42,167 --> 00:21:43,498
Are you getting enough sleep, Nicky?

547
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:44,567
You look drawn.

548
00:21:44,703 --> 00:21:45,465
He's on drugs, Mom.

549
00:21:45,604 --> 00:21:46,764
Hey, shut up, Laurie!

550
00:21:47,906 --> 00:21:49,373
I have guests.

551
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:51,506
I'll send you father out.

552
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:54,111
Try to be nice.

553
00:21:57,683 --> 00:22:00,117
So what happened to
last week's paycheck?

554
00:22:00,385 --> 00:22:01,511
The Angels took it.

555
00:22:01,887 --> 00:22:03,013
The Angels.

556
00:22:03,555 --> 00:22:04,613
What, this is football?

557
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:05,449
Footabll?!

558
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:07,387
The Angels -- baseball !

559
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:10,393
So I'm a cultural illiterate, I'm sorry

560
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:13,965
What, this is money you owe, I take it?

561
00:22:15,867 --> 00:22:18,301
For two thousand dollars,
I'm a free man.

562
00:22:23,775 --> 00:22:25,470
I got maybe fifty.

563
00:22:25,944 --> 00:22:27,468
It's in my bag in the TV room.

564
00:22:27,646 --> 00:22:28,112
help yourself.

565
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,144
I'm namin' my first kid after you...

566
00:22:29,281 --> 00:22:29,645
Mm-hmm.

567
00:22:29,781 --> 00:22:30,213
boy or girl.

568
00:22:30,315 --> 00:22:30,804
Mm-hmm.

569
00:22:30,949 --> 00:22:31,643
It's like fake alligator, right?

570
00:22:31,783 --> 00:22:32,249
Dark brown?

571
00:22:32,384 --> 00:22:33,749
You bet this on sports, you die.

572
00:22:33,885 --> 00:22:34,977
No way, no way!

573
00:22:35,654 --> 00:22:36,086
You're my hero.

574
00:22:36,221 --> 00:22:36,846
Mm-hmm.

575
00:22:49,067 --> 00:22:50,625
I'm an idiot, right?

576
00:22:51,403 --> 00:22:54,236
My son does the same thing to me.

577
00:22:54,606 --> 00:22:57,074
Is family. Mmm.

578
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:31,266
So what's the story?

579
00:23:31,977 --> 00:23:32,568
No story.

580
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:33,711
I just quit.

581
00:23:34,112 --> 00:23:35,238
Oh.

582
00:23:36,782 --> 00:23:37,942
You got another job?

583
00:23:38,183 --> 00:23:39,150
No.

584
00:23:40,385 --> 00:23:42,853
Then how can you quit a good set-up
like you got?

585
00:23:43,121 --> 00:23:45,180
I'm bored outta my skull over there.

586
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:46,379
Sittin' around, w--

587
00:23:46,525 --> 00:23:47,992
Who says you gotta sit around?

588
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:51,727
Hey, if it's more responsibility
you want, I can set it up.

589
00:23:51,863 --> 00:23:52,887
No!

590
00:23:53,064 --> 00:23:54,759
I don't want you settin' shit up for me

591
00:23:54,966 --> 00:23:56,160
I don't want any part of it anymore.

592
00:23:56,835 --> 00:23:57,995
Part of what?

593
00:23:58,537 --> 00:24:01,097
Eh, Nick, I'm a builder.

594
00:24:01,706 --> 00:24:04,231
I make things where there was nothing
before.

595
00:24:05,343 --> 00:24:06,810
What, is there something wrong
with that?

596
00:24:06,978 --> 00:24:08,843
You kiss up to Baci

597
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:12,609
and every other scumbag downtown with
a nickel in their pocket.

598
00:24:12,884 --> 00:24:14,875
The outfit tells you put three guys on
the payroll

599
00:24:15,053 --> 00:24:17,021
that you never even seen, you do it.

600
00:24:17,322 --> 00:24:19,813
If they told you to roll over and die,
you'd do it!

601
00:24:20,158 --> 00:24:22,285
You think I like to take that shit off
of them?

602
00:24:22,828 --> 00:24:24,796
What do you think puts the food on
the table?

603
00:24:26,364 --> 00:24:31,324
Nick, I always tried to do right by
you, by your mother, Laurie and Tony!

604
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:33,362
Yeah.

605
00:24:34,606 --> 00:24:36,301
You did a job on him, all right.

606
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:39,072
Your brother died in the war!

607
00:24:40,078 --> 00:24:41,102
What could I do about that?

608
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:42,337
What could you do?!

609
00:24:42,848 --> 00:24:45,373
You coulda stood up for him instead of
throwin' him in like you did!

610
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:47,313
I would've killed for that kid!

611
00:24:50,455 --> 00:24:53,652
Don't do me any favors like you did
for Tony.

612
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:57,984
Joe!

613
00:24:59,464 --> 00:25:01,762
What is this -- an antique?

614
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,367
What do you get on this thing?

615
00:25:03,468 --> 00:25:04,435
Milton Berle?

616
00:25:04,569 --> 00:25:05,934
Sid Caesar?

617
00:25:06,104 --> 00:25:07,799
I gotta fix you up with
some new equipment,

618
00:25:07,939 --> 00:25:10,032
introduce you to the state of the art.

619
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:11,309
What do you say, Nick?

620
00:25:16,648 --> 00:25:17,672
I'm in.

621
00:25:17,916 --> 00:25:19,042
Let's fuckin' do it.

622
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:27,723
He went through a lot of trouble
for you.

623
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:29,884
They give me a gun from Toys 'R Us here

624
00:25:30,061 --> 00:25:30,993
Well, what do you expect?

625
00:25:31,129 --> 00:25:32,426
And look at this outfit!

626
00:25:32,664 --> 00:25:34,757
Oh, you look handsome in a uniform.

627
00:25:34,933 --> 00:25:35,831
Please.

628
00:25:35,967 --> 00:25:38,060
If anybody I know see me in this,
I'm movin' to Canada.

629
00:25:38,236 --> 00:25:39,897
Oh, Franklin, it's just a start.

630
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:42,165
Might as well have a sign on my back
say ''I make chump change''.

631
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:42,829
Uh-uh.

632
00:25:43,008 --> 00:25:44,202
This gon' keep the parole off your back

633
00:25:44,342 --> 00:25:45,502
It don't even fit, Reesha!

634
00:25:45,644 --> 00:25:47,305
My prison clothes looked
better than this.

635
00:25:47,445 --> 00:25:48,571
Would you just stick with this
for a while?

636
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:49,645
Not bad.

637
00:25:50,482 --> 00:25:52,575
Too old, but not bad.

638
00:25:52,951 --> 00:25:54,919
Her boyfriend thinks it's Halloween!

639
00:25:58,256 --> 00:25:59,723
Yo, birdlegs!

640
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:01,188
Come back here, darlin'.

641
00:26:01,493 --> 00:26:02,960
I got somethin' for you.

642
00:26:03,695 --> 00:26:05,663
Stuck up bitch!

643
00:26:07,432 --> 00:26:08,922
Look at that one!

644
00:26:09,267 --> 00:26:10,757
Them ain't real, Desmond.

645
00:26:11,036 --> 00:26:13,800
Woman over thirty carry her tits up
there, that's plastic, man.

646
00:26:13,939 --> 00:26:15,907
Miracle of science.

647
00:26:16,274 --> 00:26:16,740
Foam fuckin' rubber.

648
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:17,364
Hit the bricks, fellas!

649
00:26:17,542 --> 00:26:17,974
Come on.

650
00:26:18,109 --> 00:26:18,575
Move it!

651
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:19,471
Hands out at your sides.

652
00:26:19,611 --> 00:26:20,168
Let's go!

653
00:26:20,345 --> 00:26:20,811
What'd we do?

654
00:26:20,979 --> 00:26:22,037
That's for us to figure out homeboy.

655
00:26:22,213 --> 00:26:23,145
Spread 'em wide!

656
00:26:23,281 --> 00:26:24,407
Come on, empty out your pockets.

657
00:26:24,549 --> 00:26:26,073
How can I hold the wall
and empty my pockets?

658
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:26,717
Yo man.

659
00:26:26,885 --> 00:26:28,409
Did we ask for your opinion, punk?

660
00:26:28,553 --> 00:26:30,111
Keep your yap shut!

661
00:26:30,622 --> 00:26:31,316
Where'd you hide it?

662
00:26:31,456 --> 00:26:32,252
Hide what?

663
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:33,322
You know what I'm talkin' about!

664
00:26:33,458 --> 00:26:34,516
Don't get smart with me, huh?

665
00:26:34,693 --> 00:26:37,161
What are you two faggots
doin' down here?

666
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:39,363
Man, this is a free fuckin' country!

667
00:26:39,898 --> 00:26:40,830
Where'd you hear that one?

668
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:44,099
You keep your shit down south of
L Street from now on, hear?

669
00:26:44,402 --> 00:26:48,168
And I'm gonna point you in
the right direction.

670
00:26:50,141 --> 00:26:51,108
Now move it.

671
00:26:51,576 --> 00:26:52,736
Go on, beat it!

672
00:26:53,011 --> 00:26:54,000
Faster!

673
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:57,309
I don't think those were the ones,
Paddy.

674
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:59,349
They were up to something down here.

675
00:26:59,584 --> 00:27:01,381
Didn't have a nickel between 'em.

676
00:27:02,053 --> 00:27:03,987
You think we stepped on them
a little too hard?

677
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:06,352
They're probably up there
laughin' at us right now.

678
00:27:07,058 --> 00:27:11,757
If you can't get respect,
you settle for fear.

679
00:27:15,433 --> 00:27:18,163
I think the ones we want
are a little older.

680
00:27:18,436 --> 00:27:20,427
I've seen that kid I had before.

681
00:27:21,373 --> 00:27:23,341
He's headed for the dirt farm.

682
00:27:29,047 --> 00:27:31,607
Oh, God, look at that.

683
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:32,578
Mm-mm!

684
00:27:32,717 --> 00:27:33,615
She's beautiful.

685
00:27:33,852 --> 00:27:34,716
Oh!

686
00:27:34,853 --> 00:27:36,320
She must be fifteen or sixteen.

687
00:27:36,554 --> 00:27:38,886
They keep makin' new ones every year,
don't they?

688
00:27:39,591 --> 00:27:42,890
American cars went to shit
after the Mustang in sixty-five,

689
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:47,625
but fine-lookin' snatch,
they keep stampin' it out.

690
00:27:47,866 --> 00:27:48,332
Mm, mm, mm.

691
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,865
Regular production line.

692
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:51,627
Oh, now look at him.

693
00:27:51,803 --> 00:27:53,031
Look who we got there.

694
00:27:53,271 --> 00:27:55,705
El Senor Ramirez!

695
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,365
A credit to his race!

696
00:27:59,044 --> 00:28:00,238
Eh, fuck you, man.

697
00:28:23,068 --> 00:28:24,035
My fuckin' luck!

698
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:26,432
We finally get a girl in the band,
she's a lesbian.

699
00:28:26,571 --> 00:28:27,560
No, she's not.

700
00:28:27,772 --> 00:28:29,501
I just asked her out, she said no way.

701
00:28:29,641 --> 00:28:31,506
This town's full of chicks
who won't go out with you.

702
00:28:31,643 --> 00:28:33,372
Yeah, lesbians, all of 'em.

703
00:28:33,645 --> 00:28:36,409
It's like the fluoride in
fuckin' water or somethin'.

704
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:37,446
Who is that?

705
00:28:37,682 --> 00:28:38,614
I know that girl.

706
00:28:38,783 --> 00:28:40,307
Just some lesbian, Nicky.

707
00:28:40,485 --> 00:28:41,918
I want to know that girl.

708
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,187
Yo, I got business.

709
00:28:43,321 --> 00:28:44,413
We're up in five, Zip.

710
00:28:44,589 --> 00:28:45,988
And I'll be there, Bobby.

711
00:28:46,524 --> 00:28:47,684
He's like a mother to me.

712
00:28:48,293 --> 00:28:49,419
Que pasa, Chato?

713
00:28:49,828 --> 00:28:50,886
What's in the pantry?

714
00:28:51,329 --> 00:28:51,761
Slow.

715
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:52,385
Extra strong.

716
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:53,292
Yeah?

717
00:28:53,932 --> 00:28:56,400
Could be shit, could be Stairway
to Heaven.

718
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:59,162
What do you say we step into my office
and find out.

719
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:00,234
Thank you.

720
00:29:00,772 --> 00:29:01,704
Yo, you got a son I hear.

721
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:05,503
That's all right -- another little
Ramirez runnin' around in the world!

722
00:29:05,777 --> 00:29:06,801
Hey, Nicky!

723
00:29:08,113 --> 00:29:09,102
Hey, Riggs.

724
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:12,280
I want you to know
there's no bard feelings.

725
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:13,348
Sure.

726
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:18,545
Your father's been so square with me,
I feel a certain amount of Loyalty.

727
00:29:18,723 --> 00:29:19,587
Right.

728
00:29:19,858 --> 00:29:21,348
He's like your brother was.

729
00:29:21,693 --> 00:29:24,287
You need him, he's right there for you.

730
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:27,390
And I'm the only washout in the family,
right?

731
00:29:27,565 --> 00:29:28,862
No, I didn't mean it that way.

732
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,834
Hey, look I'm not in the mood to hear
war stories about my brother right now.

733
00:29:32,971 --> 00:29:33,369
All right, yeah.

734
00:29:33,505 --> 00:29:33,869
Okay?

735
00:29:34,005 --> 00:29:34,630
Yeah!

736
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,502
Oh, hey, thanks for quittin'.

737
00:29:36,641 --> 00:29:38,131
Takes a big load off my back!

738
00:29:38,309 --> 00:29:39,241
Any time.

739
00:29:39,711 --> 00:29:40,405
Hey, Nick!

740
00:29:40,545 --> 00:29:41,842
I hear you quit your job.

741
00:29:42,981 --> 00:29:44,073
So what's it to you?

742
00:29:44,482 --> 00:29:46,973
Oh, this looks like the vig for
maybe one month here.

743
00:29:47,152 --> 00:29:48,278
You're into me for two grand.

744
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:50,683
You lose your job, I got a reason
to be concerned.

745
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:53,253
Where'd you get this from, your mommy?

746
00:29:54,926 --> 00:29:56,826
I hope you die.

747
00:29:58,329 --> 00:30:00,763
Check, one, two, one, two, three, four.

748
00:30:01,833 --> 00:30:05,269
Yo soy un hombre sincero.

749
00:30:05,703 --> 00:30:08,934
Yo soy un pinche droguero!

750
00:30:10,408 --> 00:30:11,773
Yo, Pancho!

751
00:30:13,044 --> 00:30:14,636
You too fucked up to play or what?

752
00:30:14,779 --> 00:30:15,803
No way, jefe!

753
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,447
I am el numero uno!

754
00:30:18,783 --> 00:30:20,250
That thing the right key?

755
00:30:20,518 --> 00:30:21,678
We'll find out.

756
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:24,011
Let's boogie!

757
00:30:24,189 --> 00:30:26,054
Uno, dos, three, four!

758
00:30:47,145 --> 00:30:51,047
'Mama, tell me no lies...

759
00:30:51,382 --> 00:30:53,441
'I don't need misery.

760
00:30:54,819 --> 00:31:01,122
'Keep those old alibis,
just come crawling to me.

761
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:09,425
'Cause I want it back, and I want
it bad, back in my arms.

762
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:17,297
And I want it back, I want it tight
and I want it right, back in my arms'

763
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:27,078
This used to be a city

764
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:30,312
where the children would inherit
their parent's houses.

765
00:31:30,588 --> 00:31:34,456
You got married, you lived upstairs --
it wasn't easy

766
00:31:34,659 --> 00:31:36,422
but you shut up and you did it.

767
00:31:36,628 --> 00:31:38,528
And a couple years later, God willing,

768
00:31:38,663 --> 00:31:41,131
there's children,
and you took over the payments.

769
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:42,930
Do you know how much our bills went up
after the last assessment,

770
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:43,556
I talked to him again.

771
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:44,292
And?

772
00:31:44,469 --> 00:31:45,367
He jumped down my throat.

773
00:31:45,503 --> 00:31:46,094
It's not gonna happen.

774
00:31:46,271 --> 00:31:47,329
Hmph! That's what he thinks.

775
00:31:47,505 --> 00:31:50,235
I think that's very unfair to
our teachers.

776
00:31:50,475 --> 00:31:52,841
You'll have your turn to speak, Nidia.

777
00:31:53,144 --> 00:31:55,772
All I'm sayin' is that this bond issue

778
00:31:55,947 --> 00:31:59,110
is an insult to the working people
who built this city.

779
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:00,551
Thank you.

780
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:03,952
Any other comments before we hear from
the council?

781
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:05,453
Uh, Mrs. Gianfreddo.

782
00:32:05,657 --> 00:32:08,592
I'd like to comment on this issue of
quality in our schools.

783
00:32:09,294 --> 00:32:11,228
My husband and I send our children
to St. Agnes's

784
00:32:11,362 --> 00:32:13,694
and it costs an arm and a leg,

785
00:32:13,965 --> 00:32:16,832
not to mention ironing
the damn uniforms every night.

786
00:32:17,168 --> 00:32:19,728
But I wouldn't have them in
these public schools.

787
00:32:19,971 --> 00:32:21,734
I was born and bred in this town,

788
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:25,305
and when I went to J Street teachers
got a fraction of what

789
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:29,072
they get today with none of
this psychological counseling

790
00:32:29,247 --> 00:32:31,078
and computer technology nonsense
they have today, but we learned.

791
00:32:31,215 --> 00:32:32,910
Not much of a turnout for our side.

792
00:32:33,084 --> 00:32:34,483
Just the Death to Taxes posse.

793
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:37,417
Listen, guys...
I've gotta break rank on you.

794
00:32:37,555 --> 00:32:38,021
Why?

795
00:32:38,189 --> 00:32:38,780
What?

796
00:32:38,923 --> 00:32:41,016
'Cuase I got Crespi breathing down
my neck in November

797
00:32:41,192 --> 00:32:42,921
and I don't want him to beat me on
the head with this tax thing.

798
00:32:43,061 --> 00:32:43,755
Peter--

799
00:32:43,895 --> 00:32:46,864
So we lose seven to two instead of six
to three like we always do.

800
00:32:47,031 --> 00:32:48,293
There's a principal involved here.

801
00:32:48,433 --> 00:32:51,459
Yeah, well, I don't have your ethnic
thing going in my district, Wynn.

802
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:53,536
I can't afford to go down with the ship

803
00:32:53,671 --> 00:32:55,696
I'm sorry.

804
00:32:57,508 --> 00:32:58,873
Now maybe I missed something,

805
00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:03,447
but where I went to school English
was the first language.

806
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:09,216
And has reading changed that much
in twenty-five years?

807
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:22,299
I like you.

808
00:33:23,234 --> 00:33:23,962
What?

809
00:33:24,135 --> 00:33:27,696
I-I don't really know you,
but I'm positive that I like you.

810
00:33:29,807 --> 00:33:30,865
Oh.

811
00:33:31,275 --> 00:33:32,469
I-I recognize you.

812
00:33:33,144 --> 00:33:34,611
You were a senior when I was in ninth.

813
00:33:34,779 --> 00:33:35,973
You...remember?

814
00:33:36,581 --> 00:33:37,775
Thank you very much.

815
00:33:37,915 --> 00:33:39,382
It's been a great set.

816
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:40,175
Yeah.

817
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:41,181
Eh, you had a brother
who played basketball, right?

818
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:42,251
He was ahead of me.

819
00:33:42,387 --> 00:33:42,910
Yeah.

820
00:33:43,087 --> 00:33:44,315
Tony.

821
00:33:44,455 --> 00:33:45,353
Tony Rinaldi.

822
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:47,048
He was a major hearthrob.

823
00:33:47,992 --> 00:33:50,790
Yeah, he went over there...and...

824
00:33:50,995 --> 00:33:51,984
Yeah.

825
00:33:52,263 --> 00:33:55,232
Yeah, that was, um...that was sad.

826
00:33:56,267 --> 00:33:58,861
You went out with that, uh, that creep.

827
00:33:59,103 --> 00:34:00,661
That whositz, Michael Rizzo right?

828
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:03,173
We got married.

829
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:05,603
Oh.

830
00:34:06,144 --> 00:34:07,406
Really?

831
00:34:09,614 --> 00:34:11,172
I walked right into that, huh?

832
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:13,708
Was he a creep in high school already?

833
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:15,352
I-I don't remember.

834
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:17,081
You're not with him anymore?

835
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:18,415
Free woman.

836
00:34:18,923 --> 00:34:21,756
Well, listen, I'm Nick...and I like you

837
00:34:22,026 --> 00:34:23,493
But-But I got, I gotta go now.

838
00:34:23,628 --> 00:34:26,153
I-I gotta drive my friends to pick up
some equipment.

839
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:28,457
I'm like their designated driver,
you know what I mean?

840
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,824
But I'd like to see you again.

841
00:34:31,202 --> 00:34:32,635
You didn't see me this time.

842
00:34:33,037 --> 00:34:34,026
Huh?

843
00:34:34,772 --> 00:34:36,467
Nice to meet ya.

844
00:34:36,974 --> 00:34:38,168
I like you.

845
00:34:38,342 --> 00:34:38,808
You said that.

846
00:34:38,943 --> 00:34:39,841
You don't know me.

847
00:34:39,977 --> 00:34:41,103
Yeah, I do.

848
00:34:41,646 --> 00:34:43,307
You're somethin' great.

849
00:34:47,885 --> 00:34:49,443
I'm glad you think so.

850
00:34:49,987 --> 00:34:50,851
Yo, Nicky.

851
00:34:51,055 --> 00:34:51,953
Game time.

852
00:34:55,493 --> 00:34:57,120
I will see you again.

853
00:34:57,328 --> 00:34:58,590
Believe this.

854
00:35:09,006 --> 00:35:10,234
Who's that?

855
00:35:11,476 --> 00:35:13,034
Some drunk.

856
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:15,037
Cute drunk.

857
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,814
Very cute drunk.

858
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:21,009
White faggot-ass motherfuckers!

859
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:24,279
If they don't got a gun
I'd fuck 'em up good.

860
00:35:24,889 --> 00:35:26,220
Fuckers!

861
00:35:27,225 --> 00:35:30,661
We didn't do shit, man,
and they treat us like that.

862
00:35:31,095 --> 00:35:33,086
Cracker-ass bastards.

863
00:35:33,364 --> 00:35:34,422
Bastards!

864
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,530
We gonna do the time,
we might as well do the crime.

865
00:35:39,237 --> 00:35:41,228
Dickless cocksuckers!

866
00:35:41,539 --> 00:35:43,370
Yeah, we fuck 'em up good.

867
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:47,907
Hey, look at
this faggot-ass motherfucker.

868
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:53,916
Aggh!

869
00:35:54,051 --> 00:35:54,642
Hey!

870
00:35:54,886 --> 00:35:55,716
Fuck man what you--

871
00:35:55,853 --> 00:35:56,945
Hey, where you runnin', white boy?

872
00:35:57,121 --> 00:35:57,815
Hey, wha--

873
00:35:57,955 --> 00:35:58,444
Cut that out!

874
00:35:58,623 --> 00:35:59,453
Help! Hey!

875
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:00,614
Hey--

876
00:36:02,793 --> 00:36:03,817
Shut the fuck up, faggot!

877
00:36:04,095 --> 00:36:05,562
Oh! Cut-- Hey!

878
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:06,594
Cut it out!

879
00:36:08,533 --> 00:36:09,465
Help--

880
00:36:10,268 --> 00:36:11,326
Garb him, Desmond!

881
00:36:12,436 --> 00:36:13,368
Help!

882
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:14,562
Come back here, faggot!

883
00:36:14,739 --> 00:36:15,831
Help! ! !

884
00:36:38,129 --> 00:36:40,654
Jesus, what happened to you?

885
00:36:42,433 --> 00:36:44,697
All the other problems we're hearing
about tonight --

886
00:36:44,835 --> 00:36:47,360
the unemployment, the drugs,
the street crimes --

887
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:51,634
those will always be the highest where
the people have the least education.

888
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:53,943
So you can pay now or you can pay later

889
00:36:54,078 --> 00:36:55,511
I mean, if you had a brain tumor,

890
00:36:55,646 --> 00:36:57,477
you wouldn't shop around for
the cheapest surgeon,

891
00:36:57,615 --> 00:36:58,673
you'd look for the best.

892
00:36:58,983 --> 00:37:02,885
And that's what we're voting on tonight
the best for our children.

893
00:37:03,654 --> 00:37:08,887
Or...or do we sell out their futures
for a few tax dollars?

894
00:37:14,031 --> 00:37:15,123
Thank you.

895
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:19,768
I think we're ready for the vote now,
folks.

896
00:37:21,672 --> 00:37:25,904
All in favor of the motion to
implement Bond lssue C

897
00:37:26,043 --> 00:37:29,444
as a method of raising additional
revenues for the city schools,

898
00:37:30,214 --> 00:37:31,579
raise your hands.

899
00:37:32,717 --> 00:37:33,706
All opposed?

900
00:37:35,152 --> 00:37:37,677
The motion fails seven votes to two.

901
00:37:43,794 --> 00:37:45,489
Quit kidding yourself, tough guy.

902
00:37:45,696 --> 00:37:46,924
You're goin' one place.

903
00:37:47,398 --> 00:37:48,387
Get in here!

904
00:37:51,235 --> 00:37:53,760
I mean, we can't go out on the street
and sell 'em ourselves.

905
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:55,462
Straight ahead up here.

906
00:37:56,207 --> 00:37:58,971
Now Carl is giving us forty-five
percent wholesale value.

907
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:00,407
The guy is slime.

908
00:38:00,544 --> 00:38:02,239
Yeah, but you owe him money, right?

909
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:04,348
So we split this score
and he'll be off your back.

910
00:38:06,017 --> 00:38:07,541
Pull up to the loading dock.

911
00:38:14,925 --> 00:38:15,687
We'll go around.

912
00:38:15,826 --> 00:38:17,191
The key only works in the front.

913
00:38:18,996 --> 00:38:19,826
You got a key?

914
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:20,931
I told you, it's simple.

915
00:38:21,065 --> 00:38:21,997
Like jerking off?

916
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:23,600
Come on, Moe.

917
00:38:23,734 --> 00:38:24,723
Nyuk, nyuk.

918
00:38:27,672 --> 00:38:28,639
Oh, Christ.

919
00:38:39,617 --> 00:38:42,017
You dead, sucka!

920
00:38:56,600 --> 00:39:00,229
''We'll beat the best price in town
or else you get the shit for free.

921
00:39:00,604 --> 00:39:02,094
Mad Anthony is the lowest.''

922
00:39:02,406 --> 00:39:05,842
We want the Mitsubishi, JVC,
Panasonic -- top dollar stuff only.

923
00:39:06,143 --> 00:39:07,110
And nothin' bulky.

924
00:39:07,378 --> 00:39:08,242
Freeze!

925
00:39:08,379 --> 00:39:08,811
Oh, shit.

926
00:39:08,946 --> 00:39:09,469
Oh, shit.

927
00:39:09,647 --> 00:39:10,511
Oh, shit.

928
00:39:11,148 --> 00:39:12,479
What are you doin' here?

929
00:39:12,616 --> 00:39:14,311
What the fuck you mean,
''what you doin' here?''

930
00:39:14,452 --> 00:39:15,680
Hold it, fucker! What you tryin'?

931
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:16,912
Uh, I'm getting down on the floor.

932
00:39:17,088 --> 00:39:18,248
I told you to freeze.

933
00:39:18,422 --> 00:39:19,286
What is this Simon Says?

934
00:39:19,423 --> 00:39:20,947
Shut the fuck up and get down on
the ground!

935
00:39:21,125 --> 00:39:21,750
That's what I was doing!

936
00:39:21,926 --> 00:39:22,756
You, too!

937
00:39:22,893 --> 00:39:24,918
Wait a minute, ju-just relax, man.
Don't shoot that thing, huh?

938
00:39:25,096 --> 00:39:26,256
Yeah, we haven't stolen nothin'.

939
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:27,624
Yeah, maybe we could work a deal, huh?

940
00:39:27,765 --> 00:39:29,096
What, uh...how 'bout a hundered bucks?

941
00:39:29,233 --> 00:39:29,961
You ain't got a hundred bucks.

942
00:39:30,101 --> 00:39:30,624
Shut up!

943
00:39:30,801 --> 00:39:32,564
We'll give you whatever we got
and then, uh--

944
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:34,261
If you don't shut up,
I'm gonna shoot your dick off.

945
00:39:34,739 --> 00:39:36,536
I don't think this deal thing
is gonna work, Bob.

946
00:39:36,674 --> 00:39:38,141
Zip, you stupid sack of shit!

947
00:39:38,309 --> 00:39:40,038
You told me nobody was gonna be here!

948
00:39:40,511 --> 00:39:42,809
Goddamn you're the worst thieves
I ever seen.

949
00:39:43,481 --> 00:39:45,142
I got to go call the cops now,
all right?

950
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:48,852
Um, shouldn't we have our hands on
the back of our necks or something?

951
00:39:49,019 --> 00:39:49,986
Listen, do me a favor, will you?

952
00:39:50,121 --> 00:39:50,917
Shoot his dick off.

953
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:52,488
I'll vouch for you in court.

954
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:23,185
Fuck you, motherfuckers! ! !

955
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,150
All right, fuck you!

956
00:40:24,288 --> 00:40:25,585
Stupid!

957
00:40:25,956 --> 00:40:26,854
Let's get goin' !

958
00:40:39,203 --> 00:40:42,661
Okay, the light's better,
you've calmed down.

959
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:44,100
Now we need to be positive.

960
00:40:44,375 --> 00:40:46,206
I was in the car when they caught 'em.

961
00:40:47,077 --> 00:40:48,374
One more time now.

962
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,247
Are these the boys?

963
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:52,013
Yes.

964
00:40:52,149 --> 00:40:53,514
That's them, I'm positive.

965
00:40:54,084 --> 00:40:54,675
Okay.

966
00:40:54,852 --> 00:40:56,217
I'll take you to Detective Riley.

967
00:40:56,353 --> 00:40:57,786
He'll record your statement.

968
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:00,157
Faggot.

969
00:41:00,691 --> 00:41:02,022
Man, what'd you have to hit him for?

970
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:04,093
'Cause he's
a white motherfucking faggot.

971
00:41:04,361 --> 00:41:05,555
How'd you know that?

972
00:41:06,096 --> 00:41:09,588
Look, if they ask us, we say he wanted
to suck our dicks...

973
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:10,992
and we tried to get away.

974
00:41:12,436 --> 00:41:13,528
What's that gonna do?

975
00:41:13,771 --> 00:41:14,897
They drop the case.

976
00:41:15,406 --> 00:41:18,307
Bein' a faggot's against the law,
so we walk.

977
00:41:19,443 --> 00:41:20,671
Say he put his hands on you.

978
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:21,778
Nah, man!

979
00:41:22,012 --> 00:41:23,502
Fuck, say he put 'em on you.

980
00:41:23,681 --> 00:41:25,342
Didn't nobody touch me.

981
00:41:26,083 --> 00:41:27,448
Whoa, no skin off my butt.

982
00:41:28,085 --> 00:41:30,212
This is a gross misfeasance of
justice here!

983
00:41:30,387 --> 00:41:32,412
When we walked by,
the door was wide open!

984
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:33,181
What would you have done?

985
00:41:33,357 --> 00:41:35,222
We assumed there was a twenty-four hour
sale goin' on.

986
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:37,691
We stick our nose in the door
two fuckin' centimeters

987
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:40,126
and fuckin' Rambo over here
comes down on us,

988
00:41:40,264 --> 00:41:43,324
yellin' out racial epitaphs,
wavin' his piece around!

989
00:41:43,467 --> 00:41:44,991
Yeah, this man is dangerous, Officers.

990
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:47,194
He almost blew my friend's private
organs off.

991
00:41:47,371 --> 00:41:49,271
The gun's got no bullets in it, sucka.

992
00:41:50,407 --> 00:41:51,339
No bullets?

993
00:41:51,475 --> 00:41:52,567
It's plastic.

994
00:41:53,410 --> 00:41:54,399
You know how embarrassing this is?

995
00:41:54,578 --> 00:41:55,203
Oh, shit.

996
00:41:55,379 --> 00:41:56,141
Do you hear what he's sayin', Bob?

997
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:57,247
So-So I-I go over there
and the window is busted.

998
00:41:57,381 --> 00:41:58,109
Brother Franklin.

999
00:41:58,249 --> 00:41:59,079
Hey, Tyrone!

1000
00:41:59,216 --> 00:41:59,944
I call you guys.

1001
00:42:00,084 --> 00:42:00,709
A half hour, nobody shows.

1002
00:42:00,885 --> 00:42:01,317
Malik.

1003
00:42:01,452 --> 00:42:01,918
Nah, nah, Tyroooone.

1004
00:42:02,086 --> 00:42:02,780
Malik.

1005
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,285
Yeah, but what the hell makes you
think it was racially motivated?

1006
00:42:04,421 --> 00:42:05,251
Ehhhh, well, look at you!

1007
00:42:05,389 --> 00:42:06,515
Look at you, brother.

1008
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:07,622
Because it was our window.

1009
00:42:07,758 --> 00:42:08,725
Oh, yeah,
I-I-I was recently incarcerated.

1010
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:09,587
Pretty sorry, huh?

1011
00:42:09,727 --> 00:42:10,716
Does the sign outside have
any specific reference to race?

1012
00:42:10,895 --> 00:42:11,623
So, man, what happened to you?

1013
00:42:11,762 --> 00:42:12,660
People know what we do at the center.

1014
00:42:12,796 --> 00:42:13,387
I surrendered myself to
the will of Allah.

1015
00:42:13,564 --> 00:42:14,622
So you think it was somebody you know.

1016
00:42:14,798 --> 00:42:15,389
Ohhh.

1017
00:42:15,566 --> 00:42:16,032
Man, I knew you would pull this shit.

1018
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:16,894
Knowledge is power, my brother.

1019
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:17,728
I try and spread the knowledge.

1020
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:18,425
What about yourself?

1021
00:42:18,602 --> 00:42:19,569
Look, I got a plate glass window,
no witnesses, uh...

1022
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:20,727
Well, I surrendered myself to
the will of Mad Anthony.

1023
00:42:20,905 --> 00:42:21,894
time approximately eleven P.M.

1024
00:42:22,072 --> 00:42:23,198
Toshiba, Yoshida, Hitachi, Horita!

1025
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:24,636
Toshiba, Yoshida, Hitachi, Horita!

1026
00:42:24,775 --> 00:42:26,504
Toshiba, Yoshida, Hitachi, Horita!

1027
00:42:26,677 --> 00:42:28,338
Toshiba, Yoshida, Hitachi, Horita!

1028
00:42:28,512 --> 00:42:30,605
Toshiba, Yoshida, Hitachi, Horita!

1029
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:32,746
Yo, the dude was a faggot.

1030
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:34,145
He got what he deserved.

1031
00:42:34,451 --> 00:42:36,476
Even if that was the case,
which I doubt,

1032
00:42:36,787 --> 00:42:38,448
it's not against the law
to be a homosexual.

1033
00:42:38,622 --> 00:42:39,816
Yes, it is.

1034
00:42:40,758 --> 00:42:42,248
So you approach this guy--

1035
00:42:42,459 --> 00:42:43,983
The fucker approached us!

1036
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:44,694
Hey.

1037
00:42:44,828 --> 00:42:45,988
What's the story here?

1038
00:42:46,363 --> 00:42:47,330
They sayin' assault.

1039
00:42:47,665 --> 00:42:49,030
This faggot come up to us in the park--

1040
00:42:49,166 --> 00:42:50,861
This isn't any of your business,
Levonne.

1041
00:42:51,101 --> 00:42:52,762
I'm makin' it my business.

1042
00:42:53,704 --> 00:42:55,035
He put his hands on Desmond.

1043
00:42:56,974 --> 00:42:57,702
Is that true?

1044
00:42:57,841 --> 00:42:58,671
Levonne--

1045
00:42:58,943 --> 00:42:59,910
Is that true?

1046
00:43:01,312 --> 00:43:03,177
He tried to, y-...you know.

1047
00:43:03,981 --> 00:43:07,849
Yeah, but I popped him one...
so he'd run on away from us.

1048
00:43:07,985 --> 00:43:09,043
Self defense!

1049
00:43:09,286 --> 00:43:10,480
You boys you don't say anything

1050
00:43:10,654 --> 00:43:12,918
until I can get you some legal aid
down here, you understand?

1051
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:14,246
Yes, sir.

1052
00:43:15,693 --> 00:43:17,456
Levonne, this isn't murder case!

1053
00:43:21,031 --> 00:43:22,828
Hey, Jeanette, you okay?

1054
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,531
They got my boy here.

1055
00:43:24,735 --> 00:43:25,827
Is he one of those?

1056
00:43:27,071 --> 00:43:28,060
Oh, Lord.

1057
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:31,100
Did he do bad?

1058
00:43:32,009 --> 00:43:34,876
Just keep 'em quiet till I can get 'em
a lawyer, okay?

1059
00:43:35,179 --> 00:43:36,544
Go on, keep 'em quiet.

1060
00:43:40,050 --> 00:43:40,539
Uh!

1061
00:43:40,718 --> 00:43:41,742
Hey, brother.

1062
00:43:42,553 --> 00:43:44,020
Don't forget your weapon.

1063
00:43:45,389 --> 00:43:46,913
It's a jungle out there.

1064
00:44:02,539 --> 00:44:03,528
Hi.

1065
00:44:04,341 --> 00:44:05,308
Hi.

1066
00:44:06,443 --> 00:44:08,308
Your friends in the band never
came back, huh?

1067
00:44:08,445 --> 00:44:10,174
Yeah, they got tied up.

1068
00:44:10,681 --> 00:44:11,909
Motor problems?

1069
00:44:12,149 --> 00:44:13,275
It's like totally dead.

1070
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:13,950
Mmm.

1071
00:44:14,118 --> 00:44:15,244
You know much about cars?

1072
00:44:15,552 --> 00:44:16,484
Not a thing.

1073
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:17,177
Do you?

1074
00:44:17,354 --> 00:44:18,252
No.

1075
00:44:18,856 --> 00:44:20,483
Then what are you doin' looking
under the hood?

1076
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:24,550
That's what people do, right?

1077
00:44:27,631 --> 00:44:30,065
You know, you shouldn't be walkin'
around here alone at night.

1078
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:31,289
I'll walk you home.

1079
00:44:31,535 --> 00:44:32,763
It's all right I can manage.

1080
00:44:32,903 --> 00:44:34,734
I'm serious, it's dangerous around here

1081
00:44:35,305 --> 00:44:36,294
Wait--

1082
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:40,203
Look I'll walk on the other side of
the street, all right?

1083
00:44:41,445 --> 00:44:42,810
Don't be dramatic.

1084
00:44:43,914 --> 00:44:46,439
I'm on Lincoln, just...between J and K.

1085
00:44:47,451 --> 00:44:48,418
Okay.

1086
00:44:50,154 --> 00:44:52,520
So...are you happy?

1087
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:54,457
What?

1088
00:44:54,725 --> 00:44:56,192
What kind of question is that?

1089
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:57,959
It's an important question.

1090
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:01,930
You mean am I...happy right now?

1091
00:45:02,232 --> 00:45:02,721
With you life.

1092
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:04,197
Are you happy with your life?

1093
00:45:05,436 --> 00:45:06,960
I'm not gonna tell you that.

1094
00:45:08,939 --> 00:45:09,963
What about you?

1095
00:45:10,441 --> 00:45:10,907
Me?

1096
00:45:11,075 --> 00:45:12,667
No. I'm not happy.

1097
00:45:13,477 --> 00:45:16,605
Maybe if I had someone like you to
be with, I could be.

1098
00:45:17,448 --> 00:45:18,972
Are you always like this?

1099
00:45:19,183 --> 00:45:22,209
No. I'm usually, you know,
askin' the regular bullshit.

1100
00:45:22,619 --> 00:45:25,918
You know, like what do you do and...
what does your apartment rent for?

1101
00:45:26,056 --> 00:45:27,318
I don't have time for
that shit right now.

1102
00:45:27,624 --> 00:45:29,387
You're on a deadline or somethin', huh?

1103
00:45:31,395 --> 00:45:32,692
You ever been in a car accident?

1104
00:45:33,097 --> 00:45:33,995
Yeah.

1105
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:36,722
Things like slow down,
they become real clear?

1106
00:45:37,334 --> 00:45:40,428
Important shit is goin' down in my life
right now, all at once.

1107
00:45:40,971 --> 00:45:42,302
Like I saw you tonight.

1108
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:45,638
Hey, I'm not that great.

1109
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:47,065
Yeah, you are.

1110
00:45:47,678 --> 00:45:48,610
Yeah, well--

1111
00:45:48,846 --> 00:45:50,313
Tell me the worst thing about yourself.

1112
00:45:50,547 --> 00:45:51,479
The worst.

1113
00:45:52,616 --> 00:45:55,107
I put up with jerks in my life for
too long.

1114
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:57,944
What, is that me?

1115
00:45:58,188 --> 00:45:59,155
I'm a jerk?

1116
00:45:59,523 --> 00:46:00,319
Oh, I didn't say that.

1117
00:46:00,491 --> 00:46:00,855
Oh.

1118
00:46:00,991 --> 00:46:01,582
Thank you.

1119
00:46:02,192 --> 00:46:03,318
The jury's still out.

1120
00:46:03,727 --> 00:46:05,854
Well, what do I do, turn your stomach
to look at or somethin'?

1121
00:46:06,029 --> 00:46:07,087
No.

1122
00:46:07,397 --> 00:46:08,329
What, am I neutral?

1123
00:46:08,465 --> 00:46:08,931
Attractive?

1124
00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:09,622
What, what are you--

1125
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:11,665
You're a good-lookin' guy
and you know it, too.

1126
00:46:11,802 --> 00:46:12,860
Big deal.

1127
00:46:13,737 --> 00:46:15,830
Well, I think you look fantastic.

1128
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:17,402
Hmm.

1129
00:46:17,741 --> 00:46:20,642
And if you're not married or involved
with anybody right now,

1130
00:46:20,911 --> 00:46:22,879
it's because nobody's figured out
what you're worth.

1131
00:46:27,017 --> 00:46:28,041
Hey.

1132
00:46:28,218 --> 00:46:29,242
Hey, what's the matter?

1133
00:46:29,753 --> 00:46:31,152
You can't say things like that.

1134
00:46:32,089 --> 00:46:33,215
Why not?

1135
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:35,687
'Cause you don't know me,
that's why not.

1136
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:41,556
It's funny, I was...I was married for
eight fuckin' years

1137
00:46:41,732 --> 00:46:44,292
and my husband never said one thing
that nice to me.

1138
00:46:46,336 --> 00:46:49,772
Anyway, I don't know you,
so...it's just words.

1139
00:46:50,941 --> 00:46:52,135
I'm sorry.

1140
00:46:54,211 --> 00:46:56,441
You were married eight years
to Michael Rizzo?

1141
00:46:57,748 --> 00:46:59,773
Who the fuck did you go out with
in high school?

1142
00:47:00,050 --> 00:47:01,347
Mary Ellen Battaglia.

1143
00:47:01,552 --> 00:47:02,678
Mary Ellen Battaglia?

1144
00:47:02,853 --> 00:47:03,683
Yeah.

1145
00:47:03,921 --> 00:47:07,721
Mary Ellen Battaglia needed
an instruction manual to chew gum.

1146
00:47:07,991 --> 00:47:09,083
She had other things, you know.

1147
00:47:09,259 --> 00:47:11,693
Yeah! She had tits in the third grade.

1148
00:47:11,895 --> 00:47:14,193
Her major fuckin' accomplishment
in life.

1149
00:47:14,531 --> 00:47:17,159
Yeah, well, I didn't live with her
for eight years, you know?

1150
00:47:18,235 --> 00:47:21,602
Well, it was...it was like I was with
the Moonies or somethin', you know?

1151
00:47:23,106 --> 00:47:24,471
That was my life.

1152
00:47:24,808 --> 00:47:26,207
I couldn't imagine anything else.

1153
00:47:30,147 --> 00:47:31,239
Did you have any kids?

1154
00:47:31,782 --> 00:47:33,374
I have a son.

1155
00:47:33,717 --> 00:47:34,649
Yeah?

1156
00:47:35,319 --> 00:47:36,411
That's cool.

1157
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:37,745
Little guy, huh?

1158
00:47:37,988 --> 00:47:39,922
My mother takes him part of the time.

1159
00:47:40,057 --> 00:47:42,821
I'm going back to school, and I-I got
a job at a restaurant.

1160
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:44,152
DeLillo's.

1161
00:47:44,728 --> 00:47:45,854
Have you been following me?

1162
00:47:46,096 --> 00:47:47,620
No, I saw you in there once.

1163
00:47:47,831 --> 00:47:49,196
It's a public place, you know.

1164
00:47:52,769 --> 00:47:57,672
Jesse, uh -- that my little boy --
he, uh, he has this disease.

1165
00:47:57,841 --> 00:48:01,436
Congenital, it...makes him like spastic

1166
00:48:01,945 --> 00:48:03,845
They call it ''severely involved'' now.

1167
00:48:08,051 --> 00:48:09,814
And what do you do to have fun?

1168
00:48:10,254 --> 00:48:11,346
Fun?

1169
00:48:12,756 --> 00:48:15,953
I tell you, Nicky, it's...it's like you
asked me am I happy.

1170
00:48:16,093 --> 00:48:19,460
It's...it's not something I can think
a whole lot about right now.

1171
00:48:19,930 --> 00:48:20,760
You said my name.

1172
00:48:21,298 --> 00:48:21,992
What?

1173
00:48:22,132 --> 00:48:22,530
Nick.

1174
00:48:22,666 --> 00:48:23,633
You said Nick.

1175
00:48:23,767 --> 00:48:25,257
I love that, you sayin' my name.

1176
00:48:26,803 --> 00:48:29,067
You are a strange fucker,

1177
00:48:29,206 --> 00:48:32,266
& I think maybe you should walk on the
other side of the street like you said.

1178
00:48:32,442 --> 00:48:35,275
Listen, I could get my sister to
babysit -- she owes me,

1179
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:37,073
you know, she's always borrowing money
from me --

1180
00:48:37,347 --> 00:48:38,245
and then we could go out,
you know, we could --

1181
00:48:38,382 --> 00:48:39,406
Hey! Hey!

1182
00:48:39,616 --> 00:48:40,139
Just slow down.

1183
00:48:40,317 --> 00:48:41,306
Cool your jets.

1184
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:43,947
I want you to take me seriously.

1185
00:48:44,121 --> 00:48:46,589
I don't think you take
yourself seriously, Nick.

1186
00:48:47,124 --> 00:48:49,058
I mean, those friends of yours, come on

1187
00:48:49,493 --> 00:48:54,192
Yeah, I know, I know, but...you know,
they-they're really not bad guys.

1188
00:48:54,331 --> 00:48:55,389
I mean, they're loyal.

1189
00:48:55,832 --> 00:48:57,356
Dogs are loyal.

1190
00:49:10,013 --> 00:49:13,005
Well, uh...this is my place.

1191
00:49:14,651 --> 00:49:17,916
You know when you're a kid...
a teenager-- right? --

1192
00:49:18,088 --> 00:49:20,818
and it's Saturday night, and you go out

1193
00:49:20,924 --> 00:49:24,724
and every place you walk into you think
you know, that this is it, you know?

1194
00:49:24,861 --> 00:49:27,091
I mean, there's gonna be somebody
terrific in here,

1195
00:49:27,230 --> 00:49:30,666
& I'm gonna meet her & my life's gonna
be completely different after tonight.

1196
00:49:31,201 --> 00:49:34,261
Today has been a wild day for me.

1197
00:49:34,538 --> 00:49:37,132
I mean, unbelievable shit has gone down

1198
00:49:37,607 --> 00:49:40,075
But I've had that feeling right here.

1199
00:49:40,610 --> 00:49:44,376
& I haven't had it in such a long time,
you know, because it never happens!

1200
00:49:44,548 --> 00:49:48,040
You never meet...that girl or-or
she's not the right one.

1201
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:51,314
And then I see you.

1202
00:49:55,192 --> 00:49:57,126
You're gonna make me cry again.

1203
00:49:59,496 --> 00:50:02,761
I can't -- I mean, I'm just --
I'm kinda tired.

1204
00:50:02,966 --> 00:50:04,456
Angela Sabino.

1205
00:50:05,268 --> 00:50:06,667
Angela.

1206
00:50:07,270 --> 00:50:08,601
That's what it sounds like.

1207
00:50:10,974 --> 00:50:13,841
So, uhh...so what if I call you up?

1208
00:50:17,147 --> 00:50:19,081
Worse things could happen.

1209
00:50:24,554 --> 00:50:25,816
Good night, Angela.

1210
00:50:26,757 --> 00:50:28,088
Good night, Nick.

1211
00:50:56,853 --> 00:50:57,877
You did it, didn't you?

1212
00:50:59,156 --> 00:51:00,020
What?

1213
00:51:00,757 --> 00:51:02,224
Don't bullshit me, Ririaldi.

1214
00:51:02,459 --> 00:51:02,948
You did it.

1215
00:51:03,126 --> 00:51:04,024
I did what?

1216
00:51:04,628 --> 00:51:05,788
Don't hand me that.

1217
00:51:09,199 --> 00:51:10,325
What if I did?

1218
00:51:11,234 --> 00:51:12,861
You're fuckin' with me now.

1219
00:51:13,036 --> 00:51:14,162
Don't fuck with me.

1220
00:51:14,671 --> 00:51:15,695
You did it.

1221
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:17,305
Didn't you, you fuck?

1222
00:51:17,641 --> 00:51:18,801
I saw you with her.

1223
00:51:21,678 --> 00:51:23,270
You don't own her, Rizzo.

1224
00:51:23,613 --> 00:51:26,013
And if you ever did,
then you don't anymore.

1225
00:51:26,950 --> 00:51:28,281
You stay away from her.

1226
00:51:28,418 --> 00:51:28,907
No.

1227
00:51:29,052 --> 00:51:30,610
You stay away from me!

1228
00:51:31,021 --> 00:51:33,148
You got your uniform, your fuckin'
badge -- you're a big man, huh?

1229
00:51:33,323 --> 00:51:35,791
This uniform,
this uniform is the only thing

1230
00:51:35,959 --> 00:51:40,293
that stands between you and a fuckin'
trip to the hospital right now, pal !

1231
00:51:40,697 --> 00:51:43,063
If I was off-duty, I'd bury you.

1232
00:51:43,233 --> 00:51:44,598
Yeah? What time do you get off?

1233
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:47,668
You're history, Rinaldi.

1234
00:51:49,206 --> 00:51:50,195
You're dead!

1235
00:51:56,279 --> 00:51:57,541
You're outta line, Mike.

1236
00:51:57,814 --> 00:51:58,940
It's none of your business.

1237
00:51:59,082 --> 00:52:00,777
You ride with me,
that makes it my business.

1238
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:02,919
You settle your personal shit
on your own time.

1239
00:52:03,053 --> 00:52:03,542
Fine!

1240
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:04,982
Just butt out, okay?

1241
00:52:05,255 --> 00:52:06,085
No problem.

1242
00:52:11,461 --> 00:52:12,723
You're gonna get yourself in trouble.

1243
00:52:12,863 --> 00:52:14,854
Just shut the fuck up about it, huh?!

1244
00:52:22,539 --> 00:52:24,905
They popped the window outta here
last night.

1245
00:52:25,475 --> 00:52:27,466
They'll be all over us in the papers.

1246
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:32,238
This is all part of
a systematic campaign

1247
00:52:32,415 --> 00:52:34,246
to undermine black manhood
in this country!

1248
00:52:34,518 --> 00:52:36,884
You stand up for yourself,
the white boy is gonna cut you down!

1249
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:40,319
These young brothers have'en sacrificed
into the jaws of the racist conspiracy.

1250
00:52:40,590 --> 00:52:41,557
That's three pages worth.

1251
00:52:41,691 --> 00:52:42,555
I'll have to do some editing.

1252
00:52:42,692 --> 00:52:45,752
We had Dwight Rollins, unarmed,
shotgunned by racist police this April;

1253
00:52:45,929 --> 00:52:48,124
Hollis Washington beaten to
death while in custody--

1254
00:52:48,298 --> 00:52:51,734
Why don't you ask the Great White Hope
here what he thinks about it.

1255
00:52:51,968 --> 00:52:53,094
Somebody busted your window?

1256
00:52:53,403 --> 00:52:54,028
'Morning, Wynn.

1257
00:52:54,204 --> 00:52:56,138
What do you plan to do about
this park thing?

1258
00:52:56,540 --> 00:52:57,006
Park thing?

1259
00:52:57,140 --> 00:52:58,038
Yeah.

1260
00:52:58,708 --> 00:53:02,166
Two young black men approached in
a park by a white homosexual.

1261
00:53:02,579 --> 00:53:03,910
Now they give him what for,

1262
00:53:04,047 --> 00:53:07,073
next hing you know they bein' run in
by the cops for assault.

1263
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:07,739
Last night?

1264
00:53:07,918 --> 00:53:09,510
What are you gonna do about it?

1265
00:53:10,987 --> 00:53:11,715
CAll the police and --

1266
00:53:11,855 --> 00:53:13,254
Go straight to the enemy!

1267
00:53:13,490 --> 00:53:15,958
Man go nothin' to say for
the African American community!

1268
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:17,649
Man just a stooge in the system!

1269
00:53:17,894 --> 00:53:19,452
You know, half of everything
you say is true, Malik.

1270
00:53:19,629 --> 00:53:21,324
The other half is pure shit!

1271
00:53:22,732 --> 00:53:23,824
That's off the record, Kyle.

1272
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:24,967
Fuckin' politicians.

1273
00:53:25,135 --> 00:53:29,367
Off the fuckin' record, Wynn, what do
you plan to do for the young brothers?

1274
00:53:29,506 --> 00:53:30,803
First I'll investigate the charges.

1275
00:53:30,941 --> 00:53:32,272
Oh, you sayin' the brothers are lyin'?

1276
00:53:32,409 --> 00:53:33,103
Is that what?

1277
00:53:33,276 --> 00:53:37,872
''Councilman Himes promised a thorough
investigation of the incident.'' Period.

1278
00:53:38,715 --> 00:53:39,875
Excuse me.

1279
00:53:42,118 --> 00:53:43,745
Fuckin' politicians.

1280
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:45,888
I'm not gonna tell you what to do about
this, Les.

1281
00:53:46,056 --> 00:53:50,959
I just want you to understand the kind
of pressure we are under here.

1282
00:53:51,161 --> 00:53:52,958
First thing this morning I get a call

1283
00:53:53,096 --> 00:53:54,961
from somebody from
the P Street Community Center--

1284
00:53:55,098 --> 00:53:56,224
I'm not backing down on this.

1285
00:53:56,399 --> 00:53:57,161
Those kids are dangerous.

1286
00:53:57,300 --> 00:54:01,259
I understand that, but...the homosexual
thing complicates it.

1287
00:54:01,571 --> 00:54:04,267
We have a very tenuous relationship
with the people in this city--

1288
00:54:04,441 --> 00:54:05,635
What homosexual thing?

1289
00:54:06,977 --> 00:54:08,410
They didn't tell you?

1290
00:54:09,779 --> 00:54:12,247
Eh, the boys said you made advances.

1291
00:54:12,782 --> 00:54:13,714
Goddamn it.

1292
00:54:13,850 --> 00:54:16,683
There was a follow-up call from
the police depatment.

1293
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:17,286
Hi, Les.

1294
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:18,011
Hi.

1295
00:54:18,188 --> 00:54:19,314
They suggested that in light of
the circumstances--

1296
00:54:19,489 --> 00:54:20,148
That's a lie!

1297
00:54:20,323 --> 00:54:22,086
Oh, God, what happened to him?

1298
00:54:22,525 --> 00:54:24,322
I saw an article in the paper
this morning.

1299
00:54:24,628 --> 00:54:26,596
It said he was mugged in the park
by some kids last night.

1300
00:54:26,763 --> 00:54:27,695
Oh, God.

1301
00:54:27,831 --> 00:54:29,128
Did it say what race?

1302
00:54:29,232 --> 00:54:29,789
What?

1303
00:54:29,966 --> 00:54:31,934
What were the race of the kids,
black or white?

1304
00:54:32,435 --> 00:54:33,094
Black.

1305
00:54:33,236 --> 00:54:34,635
Oh, great.

1306
00:54:34,771 --> 00:54:35,499
Hey, Larry, wait up!

1307
00:54:35,639 --> 00:54:36,970
That doesn't have anything to
do with you.

1308
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:37,869
Suzanne.

1309
00:54:38,008 --> 00:54:39,168
Now you know better than that.

1310
00:54:39,342 --> 00:54:40,900
I mean, he's younger
but not that much younger.

1311
00:54:41,077 --> 00:54:42,942
Like, I was a senior
when he was in ninth grade.

1312
00:54:43,079 --> 00:54:44,808
By now that's not such a big deal,
right?

1313
00:54:44,948 --> 00:54:48,247
And he's good-lookin' and everything,
so I don't think much about it.

1314
00:54:48,585 --> 00:54:50,815
I get out to my car, it's dead.

1315
00:54:51,187 --> 00:54:54,156
Turn the key, not a sound -- that piece
of shit that Michael left me,

1316
00:54:54,257 --> 00:54:55,451
I hate to even look at the thing --

1317
00:54:55,625 --> 00:55:01,188
and then he shows up, this guy Nick,
and he's like lost or something'.

1318
00:55:01,398 --> 00:55:02,865
Listen to me talk about this stuff.

1319
00:55:03,033 --> 00:55:04,432
Am I stupid or what?

1320
00:55:04,567 --> 00:55:06,558
They beat me up and then they say
I came on to them?

1321
00:55:06,736 --> 00:55:08,203
I'm sorry, but to me that's a big deal !

1322
00:55:08,371 --> 00:55:08,962
Of course it is--

1323
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:09,798
There's a principle involved here.

1324
00:55:09,973 --> 00:55:10,405
A very--

1325
00:55:10,540 --> 00:55:11,097
Of course--

1326
00:55:11,274 --> 00:55:12,070
a very important principle!

1327
00:55:12,208 --> 00:55:14,506
Of course there is, Les, if you say so.

1328
00:55:14,878 --> 00:55:15,810
I'm not a homosexual.

1329
00:55:15,945 --> 00:55:18,743
I undersatnd that, but we have
a public profile.

1330
00:55:18,882 --> 00:55:20,406
And if I was, so what?

1331
00:55:20,717 --> 00:55:22,184
What does this school stand for?

1332
00:55:22,419 --> 00:55:23,909
Let's do this inside, okay?

1333
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:26,622
Well we have yor prints all
over the van.

1334
00:55:26,756 --> 00:55:27,586
Outstanding.

1335
00:55:27,724 --> 00:55:30,192
An ever-tightening net of
circumstantial evidence.

1336
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:31,520
Who was the third guy?

1337
00:55:31,695 --> 00:55:32,627
Hell, you got the prints.

1338
00:55:32,762 --> 00:55:33,319
You tell us.

1339
00:55:33,496 --> 00:55:35,657
Look, you give me a name, I'll put
a word in with the court.

1340
00:55:36,866 --> 00:55:39,699
Wait a minute, you guys hang around
with Nick Rinaldi, don't you?

1341
00:55:39,836 --> 00:55:40,734
Nick who?

1342
00:55:40,870 --> 00:55:41,564
Forget it, Bobby.

1343
00:55:41,705 --> 00:55:43,104
He's too fuckin' smart for us.

1344
00:55:43,873 --> 00:55:44,862
Look, we give up.

1345
00:55:45,709 --> 00:55:47,040
It was him.

1346
00:55:47,177 --> 00:55:48,542
Yo, Asteroid!

1347
00:55:48,945 --> 00:55:50,606
Say ''I did it!''

1348
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:51,303
I did it.

1349
00:55:51,481 --> 00:55:51,913
No, I did it.

1350
00:55:52,048 --> 00:55:52,514
No, I did it.

1351
00:55:52,682 --> 00:55:53,239
No, I did it.

1352
00:55:53,416 --> 00:55:54,178
No, I did it.

1353
00:55:54,317 --> 00:55:55,284
I did it.

1354
00:55:55,452 --> 00:55:56,976
No, I did it.

1355
00:55:57,153 --> 00:55:57,676
I did it.

1356
00:55:57,854 --> 00:55:59,321
I-I did it.

1357
00:55:59,456 --> 00:56:00,480
No, I did it.

1358
00:56:00,657 --> 00:56:04,149
I did it! I did it! I did it! I did it!

1359
00:56:04,327 --> 00:56:06,295
No, no, I-- No, I did it!

1360
00:56:22,712 --> 00:56:26,648
Ehhh, O.B. ! Long time no see.

1361
00:56:27,650 --> 00:56:28,981
Engine problems?

1362
00:56:29,185 --> 00:56:30,652
You're the problem, Carl.

1363
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:31,752
Get in.

1364
00:56:41,765 --> 00:56:43,733
Nice rig you got here, O'Brien.

1365
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:45,367
You're doin' all right for yourself.

1366
00:56:45,535 --> 00:56:47,025
I can always be doin' better.

1367
00:56:47,203 --> 00:56:48,101
Awwwwww.

1368
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:51,696
I hate to see a man unsatisfied
with his station in life.

1369
00:56:52,242 --> 00:56:53,402
What's the beef?

1370
00:56:53,710 --> 00:56:54,699
Mad Anthony's?

1371
00:56:54,878 --> 00:56:55,902
Last night?

1372
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:56,875
Can't help you.

1373
00:56:57,013 --> 00:56:58,173
How much they clear?

1374
00:56:58,381 --> 00:56:59,006
Nada.

1375
00:56:59,182 --> 00:57:01,150
Your little friends Bobby
and Zip tripped over their dicks.

1376
00:57:01,284 --> 00:57:02,251
You should know better.

1377
00:57:02,385 --> 00:57:03,545
Hand nothin' to do with me.

1378
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:04,846
They talked.

1379
00:57:05,021 --> 00:57:06,852
I don't fall for that shit, O'Brien.

1380
00:57:06,990 --> 00:57:08,287
You should know better.

1381
00:57:08,391 --> 00:57:11,189
I got Leo Snider at Rahway coimin' up
for for review.

1382
00:57:11,327 --> 00:57:14,319
He says if I help him,
he'll put your ass away for me.

1383
00:57:14,697 --> 00:57:16,528
The vending machine hijack?

1384
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:18,397
Lehman's furs?

1385
00:57:19,035 --> 00:57:20,525
The fire on the waterfront.

1386
00:57:20,703 --> 00:57:23,263
Why not throw in
the Kennedy assassination?

1387
00:57:23,473 --> 00:57:25,407
I hate to be the one to break this
to you,

1388
00:57:25,575 --> 00:57:27,907
but a lot of people don't like you,
Carl.

1389
00:57:28,044 --> 00:57:29,033
What do you want?

1390
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:31,144
Suspect number three.

1391
00:57:31,781 --> 00:57:35,740
Somebody left a hot van outside
of Anthony's,

1392
00:57:35,919 --> 00:57:39,355
and the security guy says he saw the
third outside but he couldn't make him.

1393
00:57:39,522 --> 00:57:43,822
I figure that somebody on
the inside gave you the key.

1394
00:57:43,993 --> 00:57:45,051
That's all?

1395
00:57:45,328 --> 00:57:47,228
And a player to be named at
a future date.

1396
00:57:52,535 --> 00:57:54,162
Nick Rinaldi.

1397
00:57:55,038 --> 00:57:56,335
Oh, that's very good news.

1398
00:57:56,439 --> 00:57:58,771
You know, we should have a talk
like this more often.

1399
00:57:58,975 --> 00:58:01,569
You tell Snider to eat shit and die.

1400
00:58:01,811 --> 00:58:02,835
You sound bitter, Carl.

1401
00:58:03,012 --> 00:58:06,971
I hate to see a man unhappy with
his station in life.

1402
00:58:11,921 --> 00:58:12,979
Hey, Carl.

1403
00:58:15,725 --> 00:58:18,023
Somebody pulled the distributor head
off this thing.

1404
00:58:18,228 --> 00:58:19,217
There's nothin' to it.

1405
00:58:19,863 --> 00:58:20,887
Whose car is it?

1406
00:58:21,331 --> 00:58:22,263
I don't know.

1407
00:58:22,465 --> 00:58:23,329
Some girl.

1408
00:58:23,533 --> 00:58:24,522
Hook brung it in.

1409
00:58:25,401 --> 00:58:28,928
Uhhh...tell her we're gonna replace
the ignition system.

1410
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:34,134
Hey...Carl.

1411
00:58:35,478 --> 00:58:37,537
When are you gonna give me somethin'?

1412
00:58:37,881 --> 00:58:40,372
You tell your boyfriend Ramirez
he can come in by himself,

1413
00:58:40,550 --> 00:58:41,881
or we can bring him in.

1414
00:58:42,018 --> 00:58:43,986
The second way is not gonna be any fun.

1415
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:45,878
This is a condemned building, Miss.

1416
00:58:46,956 --> 00:58:48,253
I give you two days.

1417
00:58:48,758 --> 00:58:51,158
Two days, I come back here,
you better be gone.

1418
00:58:51,294 --> 00:58:52,226
Comprende?

1419
00:58:52,362 --> 00:58:53,329
Let's go, Mike.

1420
00:59:00,803 --> 00:59:02,270
Jesus, what a pit.

1421
00:59:02,772 --> 00:59:04,672
That baby is gonna get sick.

1422
00:59:05,942 --> 00:59:08,911
I used to come in here and shoot
pigeons up on the fourth floor.

1423
00:59:09,212 --> 00:59:10,110
Hundreds of 'em.

1424
00:59:10,246 --> 00:59:11,873
They'd come in through
the broken windows.

1425
00:59:12,849 --> 00:59:14,510
It's good for the reflexes.

1426
00:59:14,684 --> 00:59:17,346
Yeah, you should slow those reflexes
down a little bit.

1427
00:59:18,421 --> 00:59:20,286
Can you imagine living in
a place like this?

1428
00:59:20,757 --> 00:59:22,691
My father lived her when he was a kid.

1429
00:59:23,059 --> 00:59:25,027
It was a different building on
the same spot.

1430
00:59:25,862 --> 00:59:26,886
Probably the same kinda dump.

1431
00:59:27,063 --> 00:59:28,428
But he got himself out, right?

1432
00:59:28,898 --> 00:59:31,298
He ran numbers till his cousin
got him on a job.

1433
00:59:32,268 --> 00:59:34,429
Then you guineas moved in
and the place went to hell.

1434
00:59:34,604 --> 00:59:35,662
Oh, funny guy.

1435
00:59:36,506 --> 00:59:37,939
So what do you wanna do for lunch?

1436
00:59:38,274 --> 00:59:40,003
Oh, let's cook up some pigeons, huh?

1437
00:59:40,310 --> 00:59:42,175
Nah, I'm sick of Italian food.

1438
00:59:54,991 --> 00:59:57,391
Um excuse me.

1439
00:59:57,527 --> 01:00:00,052
Do you know a boy named Desmond Price,
lives in the this building?

1440
01:00:00,863 --> 01:00:04,026
He's already talked to the police,
the social worker--

1441
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:06,327
I'm your councilman in this district.

1442
01:00:09,105 --> 01:00:10,572
I seen your picture.

1443
01:00:10,707 --> 01:00:12,766
Eh, I'm Desmond's mother.

1444
01:00:12,942 --> 01:00:13,374
Oh.

1445
01:00:13,509 --> 01:00:13,975
Great.

1446
01:00:14,143 --> 01:00:16,771
Um...could I, could I talk with him?

1447
01:00:21,017 --> 01:00:22,348
You think my boy lied?

1448
01:00:22,485 --> 01:00:22,974
No.

1449
01:00:23,152 --> 01:00:24,710
But I would like to ask him
a few questions.

1450
01:00:24,887 --> 01:00:25,945
You think he lied.

1451
01:00:26,122 --> 01:00:28,022
I don't know, I wasn't there.

1452
01:00:28,157 --> 01:00:31,285
Eh, sometimes...under pressure
from the police kids

1453
01:00:31,461 --> 01:00:34,055
can say a lot of things to
keep themselves out of trouble.

1454
01:00:34,597 --> 01:00:36,428
Get out here, Desmond!

1455
01:00:38,101 --> 01:00:39,659
'Cause my son doesn't lie.

1456
01:00:40,103 --> 01:00:42,401
I want to be able to help to
clear this thing up.

1457
01:00:43,106 --> 01:00:44,471
Sit.

1458
01:00:48,344 --> 01:00:49,572
Talk to the man.

1459
01:00:50,046 --> 01:00:52,480
Um...hi, Desmond.

1460
01:00:52,949 --> 01:00:54,348
I'm, uh, Wynston Himes.

1461
01:00:54,484 --> 01:00:56,452
I'm your councilman in this district.

1462
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:59,151
Uh, I seen your picture.

1463
01:00:59,288 --> 01:00:59,754
Right.

1464
01:00:59,922 --> 01:01:00,889
Um...

1465
01:01:02,358 --> 01:01:04,019
Can you tell me what happened
that night?

1466
01:01:06,162 --> 01:01:07,925
Go on, tell the man what you told me.

1467
01:01:10,466 --> 01:01:12,957
Me and my friend Tito was hangin' out
at the park.

1468
01:01:13,336 --> 01:01:15,429
Not doin' nothin.

1469
01:01:16,372 --> 01:01:17,930
Sittin' on this bench.

1470
01:01:18,741 --> 01:01:24,077
And this dude in sweats sit by us and
start talking that he give us money

1471
01:01:24,213 --> 01:01:28,445
if w-...we let him you know.

1472
01:01:30,019 --> 01:01:31,816
What words did he say?

1473
01:01:32,655 --> 01:01:34,452
Suck us off.

1474
01:01:34,891 --> 01:01:37,359
Then he reached for me,
but he didn't touch me,

1475
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:39,255
'cuase, see, don't nobody touch me.

1476
01:01:39,962 --> 01:01:41,520
But he was gonna.

1477
01:01:41,664 --> 01:01:43,188
And that's when Tito went off on
the man,

1478
01:01:43,366 --> 01:01:45,857
pops him in the face, one-two-three,
and we run off.

1479
01:01:46,936 --> 01:01:48,130
And that's it?

1480
01:01:48,671 --> 01:01:50,662
Then the cops catch us and run us in.

1481
01:01:51,340 --> 01:01:52,432
And that's the truth?

1482
01:01:52,608 --> 01:01:54,439
You're not just sayin this to
stay out of trouble?

1483
01:01:55,078 --> 01:01:57,546
My son doesn't lie, Mister.

1484
01:01:59,015 --> 01:02:01,108
And he ain't goin' to no family court.

1485
01:02:02,118 --> 01:02:03,710
Well, I'll try and make sure
that doesn't happen.

1486
01:02:03,886 --> 01:02:04,853
Mmm.

1487
01:02:05,054 --> 01:02:06,715
Thank you for talking to me.

1488
01:02:07,023 --> 01:02:08,991
Oh, and if any newspaper people come by
try not to--

1489
01:02:09,125 --> 01:02:11,923
We already talked with a man from
Black Courier this mornin'.

1490
01:02:12,295 --> 01:02:13,319
Uh-huh.

1491
01:02:13,629 --> 01:02:16,598
Them faggots always after you up
to the park.

1492
01:02:16,899 --> 01:02:18,594
Be happenin' all the time, Mister.

1493
01:02:18,768 --> 01:02:20,258
Get back in your room, Desmond.

1494
01:02:24,807 --> 01:02:26,001
Thank you.

1495
01:02:29,278 --> 01:02:33,214
He was third party in a robbery attempt
last night.

1496
01:02:33,382 --> 01:02:35,077
The other two got caught, he got away.

1497
01:02:35,251 --> 01:02:36,980
We haven't I.D.'ed him yet.

1498
01:02:37,353 --> 01:02:38,081
Hard evidence?

1499
01:02:38,254 --> 01:02:40,313
I can nail his ass to the wall.

1500
01:02:42,058 --> 01:02:43,218
Look at that.

1501
01:02:43,726 --> 01:02:44,886
My heart rate.

1502
01:02:45,061 --> 01:02:45,959
Yeah.

1503
01:02:46,329 --> 01:02:49,423
I croak on this damn thing, they'll be
able to make a print-out of it.

1504
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:53,691
Anyway, I thought you'd be interested.

1505
01:02:54,337 --> 01:02:55,736
I appreciate it, Bill.

1506
01:02:56,672 --> 01:02:58,731
If things turn out right,
we won't forget you.

1507
01:03:09,385 --> 01:03:11,080
We could do it through our own office,
of course.

1508
01:03:11,320 --> 01:03:12,218
I can handle it!

1509
01:03:12,355 --> 01:03:14,346
We've got a timetable on this, Mayor.

1510
01:03:14,590 --> 01:03:16,524
The Japanese want it cleared by
the weekend.

1511
01:03:16,659 --> 01:03:18,524
If the Japanese pull their money out,
we got a real--

1512
01:03:19,629 --> 01:03:21,426
I can handle it.

1513
01:03:21,697 --> 01:03:22,959
Right.

1514
01:03:23,166 --> 01:03:24,394
It's your turf.

1515
01:03:24,700 --> 01:03:26,292
Rinaldi's practically your brother.

1516
01:03:26,469 --> 01:03:28,869
All you goombahs are practically
brothers, right?

1517
01:03:29,005 --> 01:03:30,472
We just need those buildings cleared.

1518
01:03:30,773 --> 01:03:32,297
I don't want to hear Parks Department.

1519
01:03:32,475 --> 01:03:33,703
Ben lanucci, that mamaluke!

1520
01:03:33,876 --> 01:03:35,639
Do you people ever go in that park?

1521
01:03:35,778 --> 01:03:36,745
There are no street lights.

1522
01:03:36,913 --> 01:03:38,437
It's like the Dark Ages,
the Medieval times.

1523
01:03:38,614 --> 01:03:40,206
You know that a professor got mugged
there last night?

1524
01:03:40,383 --> 01:03:41,941
A supposedly intelligent person, hm?

1525
01:03:42,118 --> 01:03:44,848
I wouldn't go out in that park
in a Sherman tank after dark!

1526
01:03:44,987 --> 01:03:45,783
Pauly! Come inside.

1527
01:03:45,955 --> 01:03:47,354
I feel like I'm livin'
in a Charles Bronson movie.

1528
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:48,616
Excuse me, ladies, please.

1529
01:03:48,791 --> 01:03:49,485
There's animals out there!

1530
01:03:49,659 --> 01:03:50,091
Now! Pauly!

1531
01:03:50,226 --> 01:03:51,250
Fiscal crisis.

1532
01:03:51,427 --> 01:03:52,223
Excuse me.

1533
01:03:53,763 --> 01:03:54,821
They don't listen.

1534
01:03:55,097 --> 01:03:56,086
They never listen!

1535
01:04:06,142 --> 01:04:06,972
Yo, Gus.

1536
01:04:07,376 --> 01:04:08,809
Hey, what's the fuckin' story here?

1537
01:04:09,011 --> 01:04:10,000
You're shut down, Joe.

1538
01:04:10,313 --> 01:04:11,245
For what?

1539
01:04:11,547 --> 01:04:13,913
Well, you got a septic clearance
that isn't up to spec.

1540
01:04:14,483 --> 01:04:16,576
Come on, I got a green light on
that months ago.

1541
01:04:16,819 --> 01:04:18,218
Yeah, but not on paper.

1542
01:04:18,988 --> 01:04:20,285
You know where it came from.

1543
01:04:20,489 --> 01:04:21,183
I know.

1544
01:04:21,357 --> 01:04:24,155
Then I suggest you go back to where
it came from when you talked to them.

1545
01:04:24,694 --> 01:04:27,162
What the fuck do you think
I'm out here for?

1546
01:04:27,964 --> 01:04:29,727
Septic clearance my ass!

1547
01:04:32,501 --> 01:04:33,525
We're still on the clock, Joe.

1548
01:04:33,769 --> 01:04:35,737
Yeah, well you call Belcher
and you get off the clock.

1549
01:04:35,905 --> 01:04:36,929
This could take a week.

1550
01:04:37,306 --> 01:04:39,331
Belcher says no breaks from the local.

1551
01:04:39,809 --> 01:04:40,935
The contract stands.

1552
01:04:41,244 --> 01:04:42,268
What the fuck is that?

1553
01:04:42,745 --> 01:04:44,372
Your joice has been cut off, Joe.

1554
01:04:45,448 --> 01:04:47,245
Whatever problems you got downtown,

1555
01:04:47,383 --> 01:04:49,851
you clean 'em up...
we can cut you some slack.

1556
01:04:49,986 --> 01:04:50,850
Come on.

1557
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:52,212
Don't take it personal.

1558
01:04:53,222 --> 01:04:54,553
Yo! Yo, Tommy!

1559
01:04:54,690 --> 01:04:55,349
Joe...

1560
01:04:55,524 --> 01:04:56,456
Tommy, wait up!

1561
01:04:56,726 --> 01:04:57,988
Man, I'm soory.

1562
01:04:58,728 --> 01:05:00,389
Did, uh, Nicky come back today?

1563
01:05:00,563 --> 01:05:01,587
No.

1564
01:05:02,231 --> 01:05:03,664
Hey, Joe!

1565
01:05:06,168 --> 01:05:06,862
Joe, we gotta talk.

1566
01:05:07,036 --> 01:05:07,866
We got problems.

1567
01:05:08,037 --> 01:05:11,302
That two-bit crook you work for has got
problems -- starting right now!

1568
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:12,839
We got a situation here, Joey.

1569
01:05:13,409 --> 01:05:14,273
Get in.

1570
01:05:14,510 --> 01:05:16,410
I gotta stop by the apartments
on the way downtown.

1571
01:05:18,447 --> 01:05:20,415
Fuckin' Gus shut me down!

1572
01:05:21,550 --> 01:05:22,778
It's Baci, right?

1573
01:05:23,019 --> 01:05:24,384
It's this fuckin' L Street deal !

1574
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:26,249
We got worse problems than that, Joe.

1575
01:05:26,422 --> 01:05:27,252
Nicky's in trouble.

1576
01:05:27,390 --> 01:05:28,015
What trouble?

1577
01:05:28,190 --> 01:05:30,317
He and Bobby Krausse and that kid Zip,

1578
01:05:30,493 --> 01:05:32,654
they tried to do Anthony's warehouse
last night.

1579
01:05:33,262 --> 01:05:34,126
What, is he in jail?

1580
01:05:34,263 --> 01:05:36,731
No he got away, but they know
he was in on it.

1581
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:39,165
It doesn't make sense.

1582
01:05:39,902 --> 01:05:41,802
I mean, why would Nicky need to
do a robbery?

1583
01:05:41,904 --> 01:05:42,836
Eh!

1584
01:05:43,005 --> 01:05:43,664
Was anybody hurt?

1585
01:05:43,839 --> 01:05:44,806
Nah, no guns.

1586
01:05:44,907 --> 01:05:48,570
But the thing about it is the D.A.'s
office is buttin' into it.

1587
01:05:49,045 --> 01:05:50,808
The guy's buckin' for senate, right?

1588
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:53,139
They figure they go right after Nicky,
respectable family,

1589
01:05:53,316 --> 01:05:56,877
juice with the people downtown --
shows he's impartial, right?

1590
01:05:57,053 --> 01:05:58,680
Incorruptible, all that shit.

1591
01:05:58,988 --> 01:06:00,683
They're tryin' to bury him, Joe.

1592
01:06:00,856 --> 01:06:03,825
They got a stolen van,
Anthony's place -- no mercy.

1593
01:06:04,894 --> 01:06:07,761
I asked the Mayor as a personal favor
to hold them off,

1594
01:06:07,897 --> 01:06:09,023
and he's made an effort.

1595
01:06:09,198 --> 01:06:12,133
But I got to tell you,
I don't think his heart is in it.

1596
01:06:12,368 --> 01:06:15,735
And what would it take to put
his heart back into it?

1597
01:06:16,138 --> 01:06:17,935
What we talked about with L Street.

1598
01:06:18,107 --> 01:06:19,199
Tonight.

1599
01:06:23,045 --> 01:06:24,478
Tis is my kid!

1600
01:06:24,914 --> 01:06:26,905
You're using my kid against me
like this?

1601
01:06:27,316 --> 01:06:28,112
Your nephew?!

1602
01:06:28,250 --> 01:06:29,217
It's grand larceny, Joe!

1603
01:06:29,352 --> 01:06:31,445
And Nicky put us here, not me!

1604
01:06:36,325 --> 01:06:37,257
Look at this place, Joe.

1605
01:06:37,393 --> 01:06:38,223
It's a dump.

1606
01:06:38,828 --> 01:06:41,194
It wouldn't be if your outfit
didn't have my hands tied.

1607
01:06:41,330 --> 01:06:43,195
It's comin' down anyway,
sooner or later.

1608
01:06:47,536 --> 01:06:49,936
They're not askin' you
to do the thing itself.

1609
01:06:51,107 --> 01:06:53,098
They just need to be sure once

1610
01:06:53,275 --> 01:06:55,072
it's done you don't go fixin'
the place back up.

1611
01:06:57,880 --> 01:06:59,006
Where's Nicky?

1612
01:06:59,482 --> 01:07:00,107
He's okay.

1613
01:07:00,282 --> 01:07:00,873
They haven't found him yet.

1614
01:07:01,050 --> 01:07:02,677
I put the word out -- kid gloves.

1615
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:06,585
I'm gonna have to go to Kerrigan
on this.

1616
01:07:09,492 --> 01:07:11,255
What the fuck?!

1617
01:07:13,529 --> 01:07:14,518
Yo!

1618
01:07:16,132 --> 01:07:17,190
Gus!

1619
01:07:17,566 --> 01:07:18,965
Hello, Joe, whadda you know?

1620
01:07:19,502 --> 01:07:20,469
What's this?

1621
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:22,227
You got six or seven violations here,

1622
01:07:22,405 --> 01:07:23,872
and I haven't even been
to the basement yet.

1623
01:07:24,006 --> 01:07:25,200
Oh, you... !

1624
01:07:25,374 --> 01:07:26,671
You're gonna pay some fines, Joe.

1625
01:07:26,809 --> 01:07:27,935
Oh, you fuck!

1626
01:07:29,712 --> 01:07:31,703
And just yesterday it was
all up to code.

1627
01:07:33,115 --> 01:07:34,980
Things fall apart quick, don't they?

1628
01:07:44,427 --> 01:07:44,916
Hi.

1629
01:07:45,094 --> 01:07:45,992
Hi-i-i !

1630
01:07:46,128 --> 01:07:46,560
I'm Nick.

1631
01:07:46,695 --> 01:07:47,127
I was, uh--

1632
01:07:47,263 --> 01:07:48,924
Yeah, I-I'll go get her.

1633
01:07:49,098 --> 01:07:49,996
She's in the annex.

1634
01:07:50,132 --> 01:07:50,996
Thanks.

1635
01:07:52,101 --> 01:07:53,159
Yo, Nicky!

1636
01:07:53,502 --> 01:07:55,060
You a busboy here or what?

1637
01:07:55,237 --> 01:07:56,261
What are you guys doin' out?

1638
01:07:56,439 --> 01:07:57,565
City shut us down.

1639
01:07:57,807 --> 01:07:58,466
What for?

1640
01:07:58,641 --> 01:07:59,266
What do you care?

1641
01:07:59,442 --> 01:08:00,431
You quit.

1642
01:08:00,676 --> 01:08:03,144
Nicky...come over here,
I wasnt to talk to you.

1643
01:08:12,354 --> 01:08:13,286
Nicky.

1644
01:08:14,256 --> 01:08:16,724
The cops come by just after
your old man left the site.

1645
01:08:16,892 --> 01:08:17,859
You in trouble?

1646
01:08:18,961 --> 01:08:20,019
I might be.

1647
01:08:20,963 --> 01:08:22,294
You need a few bills to see you through

1648
01:08:22,431 --> 01:08:23,796
No, no, no, no.

1649
01:08:24,066 --> 01:08:25,966
They had a real hard-on for you, Nicky.

1650
01:08:26,602 --> 01:08:29,127
If I were you, I wouldn't go to
your place for a while.

1651
01:08:30,339 --> 01:08:31,499
Take it light.

1652
01:08:32,641 --> 01:08:33,505
Thanks.

1653
01:08:34,677 --> 01:08:35,473
All I see right now is that you
and your people

1654
01:08:35,611 --> 01:08:36,737
are selling off my district piece
by piece.

1655
01:08:36,912 --> 01:08:39,437
What brings revenue to the city,

1656
01:08:39,615 --> 01:08:42,106
what brings life to the city is good
for everybody.

1657
01:08:42,284 --> 01:08:43,216
Right.

1658
01:08:43,385 --> 01:08:44,317
The trickle-down theory.

1659
01:08:44,453 --> 01:08:46,546
But things only seem to
trickle down so far.

1660
01:08:46,856 --> 01:08:49,450
You can't expect the developer to
build if he can't make a profit.

1661
01:08:49,625 --> 01:08:50,990
And you don't expect people to
watch their neighborhood

1662
01:08:51,093 --> 01:08:52,685
being plowed under without
lifting a finger.

1663
01:08:52,962 --> 01:08:54,452
The development creates jobs.

1664
01:08:54,630 --> 01:08:56,962
With jobs people can afford
higher rents.

1665
01:08:57,099 --> 01:08:59,158
And those jobs are gonna go to
the people on L Street?

1666
01:08:59,668 --> 01:09:00,828
Tell me another one.

1667
01:09:03,072 --> 01:09:05,734
I was hoping that we could cut
some kind of deal here.

1668
01:09:05,841 --> 01:09:06,933
You mean a personal deal?

1669
01:09:07,109 --> 01:09:10,169
Oh, I hear that you got your
brother-in-law on Mad Anthony's payroll

1670
01:09:10,379 --> 01:09:11,403
What does that mean?

1671
01:09:11,780 --> 01:09:13,270
I understand what it's like.

1672
01:09:13,716 --> 01:09:15,308
New guys on the council.

1673
01:09:15,584 --> 01:09:16,983
The last man at the banquet.

1674
01:09:17,219 --> 01:09:19,187
People expect you to deliver.

1675
01:09:20,055 --> 01:09:20,714
Okay.

1676
01:09:20,890 --> 01:09:23,916
I got housing inspectors,
they got teacher's aides--

1677
01:09:24,093 --> 01:09:26,084
You keep pushing Galaxy Towers
the way it's set up now,

1678
01:09:26,262 --> 01:09:27,729
and we'll fight you on
blighting classification,

1679
01:09:27,863 --> 01:09:28,795
we'll fight you on evictions,

1680
01:09:28,931 --> 01:09:33,265
we'll fight you on construction and
demolition every little step of the way.

1681
01:09:33,402 --> 01:09:35,996
We'll make the L Street apartments
a symbol for everything

1682
01:09:36,138 --> 01:09:37,571
that's fucked up in this city!

1683
01:09:38,707 --> 01:09:40,971
They can't be a symbol
if they aren't there.

1684
01:09:42,578 --> 01:09:45,547
Sounds like they got you by
the short one, Joey.

1685
01:09:46,615 --> 01:09:51,109
I was wondering, uh...since your people
have fronted me the money on this thing

1686
01:09:51,287 --> 01:09:53,778
You want me to get Baci off your back.

1687
01:09:54,456 --> 01:09:57,391
Well...he's hurting your investment.

1688
01:09:57,893 --> 01:09:59,417
We invested in you, Joe.

1689
01:09:59,728 --> 01:10:03,630
This creep...he's using my family
against me.

1690
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:06,968
You think he didn't check with us
before he made a move?

1691
01:10:09,038 --> 01:10:11,199
And if I blow my bid on
the apartment building?

1692
01:10:11,373 --> 01:10:12,738
I-I-I mean,
if I can't make the payments?

1693
01:10:12,875 --> 01:10:14,172
What would a regular bank do?

1694
01:10:14,476 --> 01:10:15,875
You're not a regular bank!

1695
01:10:16,312 --> 01:10:18,906
I'm carrying you people on my payroll.

1696
01:10:22,484 --> 01:10:23,644
Look, Joe.

1697
01:10:24,353 --> 01:10:25,684
We appreciate that.

1698
01:10:26,155 --> 01:10:27,281
We really do.

1699
01:10:28,657 --> 01:10:31,592
You'd still get to put up buildings,
you just wouldn't be your own boss.

1700
01:10:33,028 --> 01:10:34,461
Maybe you never were, really.

1701
01:10:36,799 --> 01:10:39,791
I borrowed from you to get something
for myself.

1702
01:10:43,305 --> 01:10:44,772
my brother.

1703
01:10:46,642 --> 01:10:48,735
That's not the way our society works,
Joe.

1704
01:10:49,144 --> 01:10:52,580
You got something good, first everybody
on top of you gets a taste.

1705
01:10:53,148 --> 01:10:55,480
Then you share what's left
with everybody below you.

1706
01:10:56,318 --> 01:10:58,809
We're social animals,
human beings -- not dogs.

1707
01:11:00,489 --> 01:11:03,515
Come on,
Joe...you'll do what you have to.

1708
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:09,497
And the people who know, the people
that count...they'll understand, Joe.

1709
01:11:10,299 --> 01:11:12,199
And they'll respect you for it.

1710
01:11:14,336 --> 01:11:15,598
Thanks.

1711
01:11:31,186 --> 01:11:32,210
Shit!

1712
01:11:32,388 --> 01:11:33,355
Les?

1713
01:11:34,523 --> 01:11:35,956
Preparing a lecture?

1714
01:11:36,492 --> 01:11:37,459
Right.

1715
01:11:40,362 --> 01:11:45,129
Listen...we heard about
you getting mugged.

1716
01:11:45,701 --> 01:11:47,566
I was very sad to hear that.

1717
01:11:47,836 --> 01:11:48,768
Thank you.

1718
01:11:49,071 --> 01:11:54,065
And we heare the rest, the rumor,
about the countercharges.

1719
01:11:54,643 --> 01:11:57,976
I wanted to say that we're really glad
you're gonna fight this out.

1720
01:11:58,614 --> 01:11:59,774
Who's ''we''?

1721
01:12:02,117 --> 01:12:04,051
We us.

1722
01:12:04,286 --> 01:12:08,950
You know,those of us who are gay on the
faculty...our friends in the community.

1723
01:12:09,124 --> 01:12:10,785
How could everybody have heard of
it so soon?

1724
01:12:11,026 --> 01:12:12,084
Anyhow, we--

1725
01:12:12,261 --> 01:12:14,695
I think it's great that
you're taking a stand.

1726
01:12:14,963 --> 01:12:16,362
Who says I'm taking a stand?

1727
01:12:16,632 --> 01:12:17,724
I'm not gay, Roger.

1728
01:12:17,900 --> 01:12:18,924
We know that.

1729
01:12:19,101 --> 01:12:24,004
What if I stonewall, and the police and
press and everybody believe the boys?

1730
01:12:24,239 --> 01:12:25,069
What if it backfires?

1731
01:12:25,207 --> 01:12:29,974
What...what if it plays right into the
hands of the racists & the fag-bashers?

1732
01:12:30,112 --> 01:12:30,908
Homophobics.

1733
01:12:31,046 --> 01:12:31,512
Sorry.

1734
01:12:31,647 --> 01:12:32,511
But what if that happens?

1735
01:12:32,648 --> 01:12:35,116
If you just roll over for them,
they'll never change.

1736
01:12:40,222 --> 01:12:41,246
Hi.

1737
01:12:41,590 --> 01:12:42,557
Hi.

1738
01:12:42,791 --> 01:12:45,282
Oh um, I heard about Les.

1739
01:12:45,627 --> 01:12:46,821
That's so awful.

1740
01:12:46,995 --> 01:12:47,927
Yeah.

1741
01:12:52,234 --> 01:12:53,360
Take care.

1742
01:12:53,602 --> 01:12:54,967
Yeah, you, too.

1743
01:13:03,779 --> 01:13:04,177
Hi, baby.

1744
01:13:04,313 --> 01:13:04,711
Hi.

1745
01:13:04,847 --> 01:13:05,506
Mmm.

1746
01:13:05,748 --> 01:13:06,510
How'd it go today?

1747
01:13:06,949 --> 01:13:09,349
Les Pullman was mugged last night.

1748
01:13:10,853 --> 01:13:11,911
I know.

1749
01:13:12,521 --> 01:13:13,818
It's gonna get worse, too.

1750
01:13:14,223 --> 01:13:15,315
How could it get worse?

1751
01:13:15,758 --> 01:13:17,885
The two kids who beat him up said
he was coming on to them.

1752
01:13:18,827 --> 01:13:19,885
Les isn't gay.

1753
01:13:20,129 --> 01:13:21,027
How do we know that?

1754
01:13:21,563 --> 01:13:22,530
'Cause he isn't.

1755
01:13:23,665 --> 01:13:25,428
Levonne Willis is stirring the pot.

1756
01:13:25,901 --> 01:13:27,960
He's worked up a meeting for
tomorrow night at the Community Center,

1757
01:13:28,137 --> 01:13:30,799
and the whole point is to nail me
to the wall in public.

1758
01:13:31,106 --> 01:13:32,505
Dont be paranoid.

1759
01:13:32,641 --> 01:13:34,165
Do you know who these boys are?

1760
01:13:34,443 --> 01:13:35,808
I talked to one of them.

1761
01:13:36,211 --> 01:13:38,202
Do you think he was telling the truth?

1762
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:41,142
Levonne is gonna have me in front of
every heavy hitter in the community --

1763
01:13:41,316 --> 01:13:43,682
the black press, everyone -- and he's
gonna ask me that same question.

1764
01:13:43,819 --> 01:13:45,480
Now how do you think I'd better answer?

1765
01:13:45,654 --> 01:13:47,349
Do you think they were telling
the truth?

1766
01:13:47,523 --> 01:13:49,514
Politically speaking, it doesn't matter!

1767
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:53,427
It matters to me.

1768
01:13:56,265 --> 01:13:57,357
You like that.

1769
01:13:57,533 --> 01:13:59,023
You like that, don't you?

1770
01:13:59,201 --> 01:14:00,828
Yes, you like that.

1771
01:14:01,003 --> 01:14:03,301
You like that so much!

1772
01:14:03,405 --> 01:14:05,930
I'm ten years older than my brother was
when he was killed.

1773
01:14:06,708 --> 01:14:08,733
Okay, let's go for a walk, okay?

1774
01:14:08,911 --> 01:14:09,969
He was just a kid.

1775
01:14:10,345 --> 01:14:11,972
My big famous brother.

1776
01:14:14,650 --> 01:14:16,174
I've been thinking...

1777
01:14:16,351 --> 01:14:16,908
Such a good boy.

1778
01:14:17,085 --> 01:14:20,054
what have I done with my life...
in those last ten years?

1779
01:14:20,222 --> 01:14:23,658
I mean, what have I got to show
for all that time?

1780
01:14:24,359 --> 01:14:25,758
What do you think you should've done?

1781
01:14:27,496 --> 01:14:28,793
I don't know.

1782
01:14:29,431 --> 01:14:30,762
Have a family?

1783
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:32,358
No.

1784
01:14:32,968 --> 01:14:34,128
Not a family.

1785
01:14:34,336 --> 01:14:35,803
Do somethin' heroic?

1786
01:14:36,171 --> 01:14:37,229
Maybe.

1787
01:14:37,606 --> 01:14:39,540
But not...you know,
not in the Army, though.

1788
01:14:39,675 --> 01:14:40,334
Nothin' like that.

1789
01:14:40,509 --> 01:14:41,441
What is that?

1790
01:14:41,610 --> 01:14:42,099
What is that?

1791
01:14:42,277 --> 01:14:43,403
Somethin' big.

1792
01:14:43,979 --> 01:14:45,708
I want to be my own boss.

1793
01:14:46,114 --> 01:14:47,445
What, like your father?

1794
01:14:47,716 --> 01:14:48,614
No.

1795
01:14:49,017 --> 01:14:50,143
Not like him.

1796
01:14:50,719 --> 01:14:52,084
Not anything like him.

1797
01:15:17,112 --> 01:15:18,238
So it's you.

1798
01:15:18,747 --> 01:15:19,714
Yeah.

1799
01:15:19,982 --> 01:15:21,745
I guess I shouldn't be surprised.

1800
01:15:21,950 --> 01:15:25,181
People do favors for me,
I do favors for them.

1801
01:15:25,787 --> 01:15:27,448
You know how it works, Joe.

1802
01:15:27,756 --> 01:15:28,848
Why does it have to be tonight?

1803
01:15:29,091 --> 01:15:31,286
Look the fire is very minor.

1804
01:15:31,493 --> 01:15:34,485
We gut two or three floors on
the abandoned side,

1805
01:15:34,730 --> 01:15:36,322
other side of the firewall.

1806
01:15:36,498 --> 01:15:39,626
After I get my kid in there make a few
adjustments to the sprinkler system,

1807
01:15:39,801 --> 01:15:41,268
we get a flood.

1808
01:15:41,503 --> 01:15:42,595
Water damage.

1809
01:15:42,771 --> 01:15:45,934
Nobody gets hurt,
nobody moves back in either.

1810
01:15:46,108 --> 01:15:47,336
I don't like it.

1811
01:15:47,509 --> 01:15:49,409
You're not supposed to like it, Joe.

1812
01:15:49,745 --> 01:15:53,909
You're supposed to bend over, spread
your cheeks, take it like a man.

1813
01:15:54,516 --> 01:15:56,643
I'm not too fuckin' thrilled about
it myself.

1814
01:15:57,519 --> 01:16:00,147
Don't organize any block parties
down there tonight.

1815
01:16:04,660 --> 01:16:06,218
It's life, Joe.

1816
01:16:06,495 --> 01:16:07,553
What are you gonna do?

1817
01:16:17,439 --> 01:16:19,100
You don't have to do this, you know.

1818
01:16:19,608 --> 01:16:21,200
I'm not gonna let 'em run my life.

1819
01:16:21,476 --> 01:16:22,966
If I back down now, they win.

1820
01:16:24,346 --> 01:16:25,836
Who's keeping score?

1821
01:16:27,616 --> 01:16:28,844
I'll see you in a bit.

1822
01:17:05,187 --> 01:17:07,314
I have to be careful
when he's got a cold.

1823
01:17:08,423 --> 01:17:10,288
He's always had a hard time breathing.

1824
01:17:17,165 --> 01:17:18,564
Hey, you shaved.

1825
01:17:18,900 --> 01:17:20,367
Yeah, there was a razor in there.

1826
01:17:20,836 --> 01:17:21,860
Ooh.

1827
01:17:22,104 --> 01:17:23,731
I use that for my legs.

1828
01:17:24,940 --> 01:17:26,965
You're lucky you got skin left.

1829
01:17:27,709 --> 01:17:30,439
Yeah, well, I-I-I haven't been to
my place all day.

1830
01:17:30,712 --> 01:17:32,236
You break up with your girlfriend?

1831
01:17:32,614 --> 01:17:33,546
Ohh!

1832
01:17:33,682 --> 01:17:36,344
I haven't been with anybody f-...
for a while now.

1833
01:17:36,618 --> 01:17:37,277
Why not?

1834
01:17:38,053 --> 01:17:39,247
Whenever I need somebody,

1835
01:17:39,621 --> 01:17:42,715
it's like -- zapl -- all the women in
the world disappear.

1836
01:17:43,091 --> 01:17:46,891
I swear they smell me comin' from like
a block away and they hide somewhere.

1837
01:17:47,629 --> 01:17:49,790
It's the same with guys
when they find out I got a kid.

1838
01:17:50,198 --> 01:17:53,190
They figure all I got on my mind
is roping 'em into gettin' married.

1839
01:17:56,438 --> 01:17:58,099
Well, what is it you got on your mind?

1840
01:17:59,341 --> 01:18:01,832
Usually somethin' about how much sleep I can get

1841
01:18:02,010 --> 01:18:06,947
and still go to school and go to work
and do Jesse's therapy every night.

1842
01:18:07,983 --> 01:18:09,382
Very romantic.

1843
01:18:12,621 --> 01:18:14,612
Well, I guess you can get used to
anything.

1844
01:18:14,956 --> 01:18:16,321
I don't want to get used to it.

1845
01:18:16,458 --> 01:18:17,447
It sucks.

1846
01:18:37,446 --> 01:18:39,471
You, uh, you can't be a creep, okay?

1847
01:18:40,048 --> 01:18:43,108
I mean, you start any bullshit,
I-I just don't have the energy.

1848
01:18:44,119 --> 01:18:45,450
I'll do my best.

1849
01:18:46,321 --> 01:18:48,016
I'm kinda defensive, huh?

1850
01:18:48,490 --> 01:18:51,152
You're like a Surgeon General's warning
with legs.

1851
01:18:51,493 --> 01:18:52,517
Well, I'm sorry.

1852
01:18:53,295 --> 01:18:55,286
I mean it though, uh?

1853
01:18:55,964 --> 01:18:57,158
Don't worry about it.

1854
01:19:35,103 --> 01:19:36,627
D-Do you have anything?

1855
01:19:37,139 --> 01:19:38,436
Aren't you on anything?

1856
01:19:39,508 --> 01:19:42,375
No, I have something...

1857
01:19:42,511 --> 01:19:43,842
You got quite a supply there.

1858
01:19:44,479 --> 01:19:46,208
Well, a girl can dream, can't she?

1859
01:19:46,381 --> 01:19:47,143
You want?

1860
01:19:47,482 --> 01:19:48,847
Yeah, when we get to that point.

1861
01:19:57,859 --> 01:19:59,827
Wait--

1862
01:19:59,961 --> 01:20:00,859
What?

1863
01:20:09,304 --> 01:20:10,362
It's all right.

1864
01:20:13,909 --> 01:20:15,672
You still up for this?

1865
01:20:16,845 --> 01:20:18,676
I could be persuaded.

1866
01:20:23,885 --> 01:20:32,918
Oh! O-Oh! Ah! Oh! Ooh!

1867
01:20:35,430 --> 01:20:37,125
Mmm.

1868
01:20:38,633 --> 01:20:40,157
Mmmm.

1869
01:20:42,204 --> 01:20:43,228
Oooh.

1870
01:20:44,472 --> 01:20:45,564
Ahhh.

1871
01:20:45,941 --> 01:20:46,873
You okay?

1872
01:20:47,609 --> 01:20:48,576
Yeah.

1873
01:20:49,778 --> 01:20:53,908
When I started to go off...
I caught a cramp in my foot.

1874
01:20:54,082 --> 01:20:55,071
A foot cramp!

1875
01:21:02,457 --> 01:21:02,946
You know what?

1876
01:21:03,124 --> 01:21:03,715
What?

1877
01:21:03,892 --> 01:21:04,551
It went away though.

1878
01:21:04,726 --> 01:21:05,317
Oh, yeah?

1879
01:21:05,493 --> 01:21:06,187
Hmmm.

1880
01:21:07,295 --> 01:21:11,629
''Dear Doctor Ruth, lately my wife's
been having orgasms in her toes.''

1881
01:21:12,968 --> 01:21:13,957
Come here, baby.

1882
01:21:15,003 --> 01:21:15,628
Ohhhh.

1883
01:21:15,804 --> 01:21:16,964
''Is this normal?''

1884
01:21:19,407 --> 01:21:21,136
Bring me a towel, baby.

1885
01:21:21,910 --> 01:21:22,638
Mmm.

1886
01:21:23,378 --> 01:21:24,868
Don't stand in front of the window.

1887
01:21:25,180 --> 01:21:26,977
Poor Mrs. Hurley is gonna have a stroke

1888
01:21:27,115 --> 01:21:29,276
she sees your pretty behind
moonin' out at her.

1889
01:21:44,633 --> 01:21:46,066
Did I make you forget?

1890
01:21:46,468 --> 01:21:47,628
Forget about what?

1891
01:21:48,737 --> 01:21:50,500
All your problems.

1892
01:21:51,406 --> 01:21:53,374
Sugar, I forgot my name.

1893
01:22:14,462 --> 01:22:15,360
Joe?

1894
01:22:15,530 --> 01:22:16,690
How long have you been here?

1895
01:22:17,699 --> 01:22:18,631
I don't know.

1896
01:22:19,634 --> 01:22:20,623
Uh, not long.

1897
01:22:21,269 --> 01:22:22,293
Are you hungry?

1898
01:22:23,338 --> 01:22:24,896
Mrs. Ramirez made a casserole.

1899
01:22:25,307 --> 01:22:26,365
No.

1900
01:22:27,475 --> 01:22:28,407
I'm not hungry.

1901
01:22:30,445 --> 01:22:31,571
Joe?

1902
01:22:33,281 --> 01:22:34,646
Something the matter?

1903
01:22:37,352 --> 01:22:39,684
Nicky's in trouble.

1904
01:22:41,990 --> 01:22:43,651
He's wanted for a robbery.

1905
01:22:45,860 --> 01:22:46,485
Is he all right?

1906
01:22:46,661 --> 01:22:48,128
Uh, I don't know, Pina.

1907
01:22:49,531 --> 01:22:50,998
They haven't found him yet.

1908
01:22:52,867 --> 01:22:53,993
He didn't do it...?

1909
01:22:58,173 --> 01:22:59,538
Yes, he did.

1910
01:23:01,242 --> 01:23:02,174
Then I'll get Bart on the phone--

1911
01:23:02,310 --> 01:23:04,505
No, it's gonna take more than a lawyer.

1912
01:23:04,946 --> 01:23:07,176
I've...already put things in motion.

1913
01:23:09,951 --> 01:23:11,282
What does that mean?

1914
01:23:13,555 --> 01:23:14,715
What did you do?

1915
01:23:46,554 --> 01:23:47,248
Help.

1916
01:23:47,422 --> 01:23:48,389
Help, we need help.

1917
01:23:48,590 --> 01:23:50,558
We need help clearing our warehouse of
these fantastic bargains.

1918
01:23:50,825 --> 01:23:54,818
We've got great deals on psychosis,
neurosis, dementia, amnesia

1919
01:23:55,163 --> 01:23:57,256
schizoid,paranoid, psychotropic seizure

1920
01:23:57,432 --> 01:23:59,161
hebephrenic, melancholic, agoraphobic,

1921
01:23:59,334 --> 01:24:01,097
alcoholic, manic, manic-depressive,

1922
01:24:01,269 --> 01:24:05,433
genetically regressive, rabies,
scabies, char-babies.

1923
01:24:05,607 --> 01:24:06,471
Help, help.

1924
01:24:06,608 --> 01:24:07,302
We need help.

1925
01:24:07,475 --> 01:24:09,636
We need help clearing our warehouse of
these fantastic bargains.

1926
01:24:09,811 --> 01:24:10,869
We've got great deals on psychosis,

1927
01:24:11,012 --> 01:24:12,172
neurosis, dementia, amnesia, schizoid,

1928
01:24:12,347 --> 01:24:14,076
Maybe we could plea bargain.

1929
01:24:14,249 --> 01:24:16,183
No, we have to have something
that they want, Bobby.

1930
01:24:16,317 --> 01:24:17,284
Besides Nick.

1931
01:24:17,419 --> 01:24:18,443
Yeah, but that's out.

1932
01:24:18,620 --> 01:24:19,678
That's out.

1933
01:24:20,989 --> 01:24:22,581
We're gonna do time then.
Right.

1934
01:24:22,757 --> 01:24:23,985
Hebephranlo, achlzophrenic, alcohollc,

1935
01:24:24,159 --> 01:24:26,684
aorophobic, melancholla,
eoholalia, catatonia.

1936
01:24:26,861 --> 01:24:28,055
Maybe this is hell.

1937
01:24:29,164 --> 01:24:32,793
No, if this was hell,
my mother would be here...

1938
01:24:33,501 --> 01:24:35,025
Reading from USA Today about

1939
01:24:35,203 --> 01:24:40,004
which foods are the most
mucus-producing when you have a cold.

1940
01:24:40,141 --> 01:24:44,043
Compared to my house this is Disneyland

1941
01:24:44,212 --> 01:24:45,372
Bring on the night, shut out the light!

1942
01:24:45,547 --> 01:24:46,605
Bring on the night, shut out the light!

1943
01:24:46,781 --> 01:24:47,975
Bring on the night, shut out the light!

1944
01:24:48,149 --> 01:24:48,808
Shut out the light!

1945
01:24:48,983 --> 01:24:49,813
Shut out the light!

1946
01:24:52,821 --> 01:24:53,913
Aw, shit.

1947
01:24:54,222 --> 01:24:55,746
What'd he have to do that for?

1948
01:25:20,014 --> 01:25:21,038
Damn.

1949
01:25:22,917 --> 01:25:26,353
Hey, if you want to sneak off,
you can go out the front door.

1950
01:25:28,623 --> 01:25:31,148
Half the fire engines in the world
are down on L Street.

1951
01:25:32,093 --> 01:25:33,958
I think it might be one of
my father's buildings.

1952
01:25:36,664 --> 01:25:38,529
Your father owns a slum?

1953
01:25:38,967 --> 01:25:39,524
Back it up.

1954
01:25:39,701 --> 01:25:40,258
Come on, people.

1955
01:25:40,435 --> 01:25:41,265
Come on.

1956
01:25:41,402 --> 01:25:42,733
Come on,we don't want any injuries here

1957
01:25:42,871 --> 01:25:43,530
Come on, back it up.

1958
01:25:43,705 --> 01:25:44,103
Let's go.

1959
01:25:44,272 --> 01:25:45,170
Let's go.

1960
01:25:45,306 --> 01:25:46,898
Let's get everyone back here!

1961
01:25:50,578 --> 01:25:51,408
Kevin?

1962
01:25:52,013 --> 01:25:52,877
Kevin!

1963
01:25:53,548 --> 01:25:54,537
You got it under control?

1964
01:25:54,916 --> 01:25:56,884
The floors are startin'
to fall through!

1965
01:25:57,218 --> 01:25:59,778
It won't spread next door,
but you got a flood in this one.

1966
01:26:00,088 --> 01:26:02,318
Your water main went with
your sprinkler system.

1967
01:26:02,957 --> 01:26:04,481
And there's nobody hurt though?

1968
01:26:04,792 --> 01:26:06,657
We may have some people on
the fourth here.

1969
01:26:08,062 --> 01:26:09,393
But that side's abandoned!

1970
01:26:32,987 --> 01:26:35,478
Nothin' we could see.

1971
01:26:35,790 --> 01:26:38,258
If anything else is on the fourth floor
it's impossible to get to 'em.

1972
01:26:38,393 --> 01:26:39,257
Where were they?

1973
01:26:39,394 --> 01:26:40,326
Down on the floor.

1974
01:26:48,269 --> 01:26:48,894
Nick!

1975
01:26:49,070 --> 01:26:49,593
Move it back, let's go.

1976
01:26:49,771 --> 01:26:50,260
Nick! !

1977
01:26:50,438 --> 01:26:51,097
Back it up folks.

1978
01:26:51,272 --> 01:26:52,068
Nick! !

1979
01:26:52,240 --> 01:26:53,138
Give the fellas room to work.

1980
01:26:53,274 --> 01:26:54,241
Hey, where you goin'?

1981
01:26:54,375 --> 01:26:54,841
Yo, folks.

1982
01:26:55,410 --> 01:26:56,308
Nick! ! !
Hey, what'd I tell you?!

1983
01:26:56,444 --> 01:26:57,775
Yo, back it up, let's go!

1984
01:26:57,912 --> 01:26:59,140
Hey, Paddy.

1985
01:26:59,747 --> 01:27:01,374
Have we still got a want on that kid?

1986
01:27:02,383 --> 01:27:03,315
Isn't that Ramirez?

1987
01:27:03,518 --> 01:27:04,883
It's okay, it's okay.

1988
01:27:05,053 --> 01:27:06,714
We'll have him in the car
that follows directly after her.

1989
01:27:06,888 --> 01:27:07,855
After the funeral.

1990
01:27:09,023 --> 01:27:10,217
All right, come on, move back.

1991
01:27:10,391 --> 01:27:11,255
Let's go.

1992
01:27:11,459 --> 01:27:12,858
Come on, let's call it a night.

1993
01:27:20,501 --> 01:27:24,096
Help! Help! Help, we need help! Help!

1994
01:27:26,541 --> 01:27:27,974
Any messages for me?

1995
01:27:30,044 --> 01:27:31,011
We got bargains.

1996
01:27:31,145 --> 01:27:32,237
W-We got deals.

1997
01:27:32,981 --> 01:27:34,812
All your electronics needs!

1998
01:27:35,617 --> 01:27:36,743
We got deals.

1999
01:27:37,118 --> 01:27:38,142
Under one roof.

2000
01:27:38,653 --> 01:27:39,620
Under one roof.

2001
01:27:40,121 --> 01:27:42,589
Help! Help! We need help!

2002
01:27:42,724 --> 01:27:43,986
Man, who the fuck are you?

2003
01:27:44,859 --> 01:27:45,791
I am the lowest.

2004
01:27:45,927 --> 01:27:47,451
Who the fuck are you?

2005
01:27:47,829 --> 01:27:48,318
Look, uh--

2006
01:27:48,496 --> 01:27:49,554
Hey, Levonne!

2007
01:27:49,731 --> 01:27:50,561
Levonne, you workin' here?

2008
01:27:50,698 --> 01:27:52,996
No,I just came by to check out the show

2009
01:27:53,134 --> 01:27:55,967
Look, I ain't seen so much paper
in all my life.

2010
01:27:56,104 --> 01:27:58,095
And all of 'em
ask the same damn questions.

2011
01:27:58,239 --> 01:28:01,697
You see, it helps them stall while they
try to figure out a story to tell you.

2012
01:28:01,876 --> 01:28:03,741
Why settle for less
when you can have it all?

2013
01:28:03,978 --> 01:28:05,741
Why settle for less
when you can have it all?

2014
01:28:07,048 --> 01:28:08,379
Money talks, nobody walks.

2015
01:28:08,683 --> 01:28:09,650
Money talks, nobody walks.

2016
01:28:09,784 --> 01:28:10,409
Money talks.

2017
01:28:10,585 --> 01:28:12,018
Money talks, but nobody walks.

2018
01:28:12,520 --> 01:28:13,316
Money talks, nobody walks.

2019
01:28:13,488 --> 01:28:13,954
Money talks.

2020
01:28:14,122 --> 01:28:15,646
Money talks, but nobody walks.

2021
01:28:19,627 --> 01:28:20,093
Hi, Wynn.

2022
01:28:20,228 --> 01:28:21,160
Uh, hi.

2023
01:28:21,362 --> 01:28:22,829
Um, how many people was it?

2024
01:28:23,031 --> 01:28:26,467
Uhh...thirteen families,
a couple of singles.

2025
01:28:26,868 --> 01:28:28,859
Only a few have family
they can stay with.

2026
01:28:29,070 --> 01:28:31,766
And how long till they rehab the side
that didn't burn?

2027
01:28:32,106 --> 01:28:33,664
Rinaldi says it's totalled.

2028
01:28:33,941 --> 01:28:36,273
He's gonna knock it down
and sell the land.

2029
01:28:37,645 --> 01:28:39,112
The Development Package.

2030
01:28:40,581 --> 01:28:41,878
Not very subtle, are they?

2031
01:28:42,016 --> 01:28:43,244
Que se puede hacer?

2032
01:28:44,652 --> 01:28:45,414
I'll see you later, Wynn.

2033
01:28:45,586 --> 01:28:46,450
Yeah.

2034
01:28:47,955 --> 01:28:48,979
Levonne.

2035
01:28:49,557 --> 01:28:50,922
What's this, Wynn?

2036
01:28:51,292 --> 01:28:52,316
A photo opportunity?

2037
01:28:52,493 --> 01:28:54,825
And what would you be saying
if I didn't come?

2038
01:28:55,430 --> 01:28:55,794
Hi.

2039
01:28:55,930 --> 01:28:56,555
Hi.

2040
01:28:56,864 --> 01:28:57,592
Whose is this?

2041
01:28:57,965 --> 01:28:58,522
It's mine.

2042
01:28:58,700 --> 01:28:59,325
Would you hold her for a minute?

2043
01:28:59,500 --> 01:28:59,829
Oh, yeah?

2044
01:28:59,967 --> 01:29:00,365
Yeah.

2045
01:29:00,501 --> 01:29:00,933
Hey there.

2046
01:29:01,069 --> 01:29:02,001
Felice had to work today.

2047
01:29:02,203 --> 01:29:02,931
What's your name?

2048
01:29:04,272 --> 01:29:05,239
She looks just like you.

2049
01:29:05,373 --> 01:29:05,771
Yeah.

2050
01:29:05,907 --> 01:29:06,635
Maybe.

2051
01:29:07,208 --> 01:29:08,402
Look, can I talk to you for a minute?

2052
01:29:09,210 --> 01:29:10,336
Man, I wish you'd reconsider
this meeting tonight--

2053
01:29:10,511 --> 01:29:12,502
Look, if you have to go and kiss
the Man's ass, that's your problem.

2054
01:29:12,680 --> 01:29:13,840
That's off the point, Levonne!

2055
01:29:14,148 --> 01:29:15,877
Now this here,
this is what's worth fighting for.

2056
01:29:16,084 --> 01:29:16,982
We have to choose where we make a stand

2057
01:29:17,118 --> 01:29:18,380
Wait, what do you mean,
wha-what do you mean, ''we''?

2058
01:29:18,553 --> 01:29:18,985
Okay, it's...

2059
01:29:19,120 --> 01:29:19,586
Huh?

2060
01:29:19,754 --> 01:29:21,722
it's your ass.

2061
01:29:31,199 --> 01:29:32,791
They probably started it themselves.

2062
01:29:33,568 --> 01:29:34,899
They had no power in there.

2063
01:29:35,803 --> 01:29:37,270
They used candles and shit.

2064
01:29:37,472 --> 01:29:38,632
They probably knocked somethin' over.

2065
01:29:39,874 --> 01:29:40,841
Arson.

2066
01:29:41,042 --> 01:29:41,770
Huh?

2067
01:29:42,009 --> 01:29:42,475
Arson.

2068
01:29:42,643 --> 01:29:43,610
It was a torch job.

2069
01:29:43,778 --> 01:29:44,676
Professional.

2070
01:29:47,248 --> 01:29:48,579
How do you know that?

2071
01:29:48,783 --> 01:29:50,751
'Cause I lived here forty years,
that how.

2072
01:29:51,252 --> 01:29:54,221
Listen to me, I want you to be calm
about this, all right?

2073
01:29:54,822 --> 01:29:57,052
That guy you went off on yesterday
made the charts.

2074
01:29:57,358 --> 01:29:58,450
Nick Rinaldi?

2075
01:29:59,360 --> 01:30:00,327
What'd he do?

2076
01:30:00,461 --> 01:30:01,894
Robbery suspect.

2077
01:30:02,363 --> 01:30:03,694
Suspect, right?

2078
01:30:03,998 --> 01:30:04,987
No guns involved.

2079
01:30:05,633 --> 01:30:06,531
No priors.

2080
01:30:06,834 --> 01:30:08,961
No reason to believe
he's armed or dangerous.

2081
01:30:09,337 --> 01:30:12,170
We see him, you stay in the car,
I make the collar, right?

2082
01:30:13,207 --> 01:30:13,639
Right?

2083
01:30:13,775 --> 01:30:14,366
Right!

2084
01:30:14,542 --> 01:30:16,271
Just let me at him in the fuckin' car.

2085
01:30:16,611 --> 01:30:17,669
You're a mess, kid.

2086
01:30:20,548 --> 01:30:21,515
Where you turnin'?

2087
01:30:22,083 --> 01:30:23,141
The site up here.

2088
01:30:23,317 --> 01:30:24,614
He was workin' that job.

2089
01:30:24,752 --> 01:30:25,878
Ferraro checked it out yesterday.

2090
01:30:26,053 --> 01:30:26,985
He quit.

2091
01:30:27,688 --> 01:30:29,053
Fuckin' deadbeat.

2092
01:30:29,257 --> 01:30:32,226
She takes up with
a fuckin' deadbeat thief!

2093
01:30:32,493 --> 01:30:33,687
So what's it to you anymore?

2094
01:30:33,861 --> 01:30:35,761
Tom, it reflects on me, all right?

2095
01:30:35,897 --> 01:30:38,365
She's my exwife,the mother of my child!

2096
01:30:38,599 --> 01:30:39,531
Child?

2097
01:30:40,334 --> 01:30:42,029
You never told me you had a kid.

2098
01:30:42,937 --> 01:30:43,995
A boy or girl?

2099
01:30:44,672 --> 01:30:45,536
Boy.

2100
01:30:46,073 --> 01:30:47,040
How old?

2101
01:30:49,043 --> 01:30:50,067
He's two.

2102
01:30:51,012 --> 01:30:51,774
Huh!

2103
01:30:51,946 --> 01:30:53,208
Two-year-old son, huh?

2104
01:30:54,649 --> 01:30:56,139
I never knew you had a kid.

2105
01:30:58,653 --> 01:30:59,642
Well, I do.

2106
01:31:00,721 --> 01:31:02,848
SANTO RIVERA FUNERAL HOME

2107
01:31:16,637 --> 01:31:17,831
Hector.

2108
01:31:18,906 --> 01:31:21,704
Whatever she wants,
you cut your price in half.

2109
01:31:22,276 --> 01:31:23,971
I'll pay the difference.

2110
01:31:24,912 --> 01:31:26,106
And don't let her know.

2111
01:31:31,719 --> 01:31:32,242
Hey, Errol !

2112
01:31:32,420 --> 01:31:32,977
Hey, Errol !

2113
01:31:33,154 --> 01:31:33,916
Morning, fellas!

2114
01:31:35,456 --> 01:31:37,686
It was a lot more fun playing here
when they were afraid of me.

2115
01:31:38,025 --> 01:31:39,390
Yeah, I took them to court.

2116
01:31:39,594 --> 01:31:40,561
This was restricted?

2117
01:31:40,795 --> 01:31:43,355
Yeah, no blacks, no Jews,
no undesirable elements.

2118
01:31:43,731 --> 01:31:47,258
I'd hang out at the eighteenth green by
the clubhouse and just smile...

2119
01:31:47,568 --> 01:31:49,763
and make the old bastards twelve-putt
the final hole.

2120
01:31:50,438 --> 01:31:52,736
Took two years
before anybody said hello.

2121
01:31:52,940 --> 01:31:54,669
Must've been tough to concentrate on
your game.

2122
01:31:56,043 --> 01:31:57,408
I never played better.

2123
01:32:03,050 --> 01:32:05,041
So you got yourself a nice little mess,
Wynn.

2124
01:32:06,020 --> 01:32:07,487
Makes me glad I'm retired.

2125
01:32:07,755 --> 01:32:09,347
Well, you were operating on
a bigger scale.

2126
01:32:09,590 --> 01:32:10,557
Scale doesn't matter.

2127
01:32:10,892 --> 01:32:14,328
You always try to gain some ground
no matter what the situation is.

2128
01:32:14,495 --> 01:32:15,962
You make some good come out of it.

2129
01:32:16,197 --> 01:32:17,994
I don't see how this is good
for anybody.

2130
01:32:18,332 --> 01:32:19,765
You think those boys are lyin',
don't you?

2131
01:32:19,934 --> 01:32:20,832
Well, it--

2132
01:32:21,135 --> 01:32:22,159
You wouldn't be here otherwise.

2133
01:32:22,336 --> 01:32:24,770
I think that it's too big for them to
go back on their story now.

2134
01:32:30,611 --> 01:32:32,078
I didn't use enough club.

2135
01:32:33,114 --> 01:32:34,342
I hage it when I do that.

2136
01:32:34,582 --> 01:32:36,072
I nibble my way up to the green.

2137
01:32:36,851 --> 01:32:38,079
It's a failure of never.

2138
01:32:38,286 --> 01:32:40,277
Why I should have to take a stance on
this at all is beyond me--

2139
01:32:40,454 --> 01:32:41,352
You're not a policeman.

2140
01:32:41,489 --> 01:32:41,887
Right.

2141
01:32:42,023 --> 01:32:42,455
Nor a judge.

2142
01:32:42,590 --> 01:32:43,147
Right.

2143
01:32:43,324 --> 01:32:44,120
Right.

2144
01:32:45,059 --> 01:32:46,083
But the moment will come

2145
01:32:46,260 --> 01:32:48,660
when Levonne Willis will put it to me
in front of the whole community.

2146
01:32:48,863 --> 01:32:50,330
''Do you think our boys are lying?''

2147
01:32:51,732 --> 01:32:52,699
Wedge?

2148
01:32:54,168 --> 01:32:55,157
What?

2149
01:32:55,403 --> 01:32:58,133
Do you think I could use a wedge from
this far out?

2150
01:32:59,040 --> 01:33:00,166
I don't play.

2151
01:33:00,675 --> 01:33:01,073
Tennis?

2152
01:33:01,208 --> 01:33:01,640
Racquetball?

2153
01:33:01,776 --> 01:33:02,743
I don't play anything.

2154
01:33:04,946 --> 01:33:06,345
You do have a problem.

2155
01:33:09,083 --> 01:33:13,486
You,uh...you could say you believe them

2156
01:33:13,721 --> 01:33:16,690
If we're gonna take power,
we have to take responsibility, too!

2157
01:33:18,059 --> 01:33:20,027
You're absolutely right, Professor.

2158
01:33:21,362 --> 01:33:22,920
How are you, darling?

2159
01:33:23,097 --> 01:33:25,793
It's good to see you up
and around again.

2160
01:33:25,967 --> 01:33:27,059
You got your color back.

2161
01:33:27,234 --> 01:33:28,166
That's marvelous.

2162
01:33:28,469 --> 01:33:30,164
Oh, you should've been there
last night, Ernie.

2163
01:33:30,338 --> 01:33:31,327
We had a big one.

2164
01:33:31,639 --> 01:33:33,573
The equipment our boys have now.

2165
01:33:33,708 --> 01:33:35,676
Not like in the old days,
a bucket and a ladder.

2166
01:33:35,843 --> 01:33:36,537
How's your fingers, huh?

2167
01:33:36,711 --> 01:33:37,678
Make a fist, make a fist.

2168
01:33:37,812 --> 01:33:38,176
Beautiful !

2169
01:33:38,312 --> 01:33:39,074
Beautiful !

2170
01:33:39,714 --> 01:33:42,114
Did you come for the lasagna, Joe,
or is this official business?

2171
01:33:42,783 --> 01:33:44,580
Two people are dead because of
you and me.

2172
01:33:44,752 --> 01:33:45,377
They were trespassing.

2173
01:33:45,553 --> 01:33:47,521
Those are the kind of
people accidents happen to.

2174
01:33:48,522 --> 01:33:49,489
You suck.

2175
01:33:49,824 --> 01:33:53,885
Joe, things change fast, people get hurt.

2176
01:33:54,195 --> 01:33:55,594
I'm sorry about that.

2177
01:33:55,830 --> 01:33:56,797
It was an accident.

2178
01:33:57,264 --> 01:34:01,997
Now if everybody stands up like a good
soldier, we can stay on top of it.

2179
01:34:02,236 --> 01:34:07,868
Joe...in the next couple of years,
this town is gonna be one big yard sale

2180
01:34:08,142 --> 01:34:11,270
And anyone with a half a brain
will make tracks

2181
01:34:11,512 --> 01:34:15,243
and let the blacks and the Spanish
duke it out over whatever's left.

2182
01:34:16,350 --> 01:34:18,341
I want you off of my kid.

2183
01:34:18,586 --> 01:34:19,644
I'll call Walsh.

2184
01:34:19,820 --> 01:34:21,811
We'll take his name out of the computer

2185
01:34:21,989 --> 01:34:23,115
It never happened.

2186
01:34:23,324 --> 01:34:24,552
And the other two?

2187
01:34:25,026 --> 01:34:26,220
Anthony is good people.

2188
01:34:26,494 --> 01:34:28,485
He'll drop the charges if I tell him to

2189
01:34:29,296 --> 01:34:30,388
Tell him to.

2190
01:34:30,598 --> 01:34:32,361
Surprise!

2191
01:34:35,336 --> 01:34:37,964
Mrs. Donelly -- ninety years old.

2192
01:34:38,806 --> 01:34:39,465
Joe!

2193
01:34:39,640 --> 01:34:42,632
Ninety years ago
the lrish ran this town.

2194
01:34:42,943 --> 01:34:45,002
There were horses shitting
on Jefferson Street.

2195
01:34:45,446 --> 01:34:50,645
My grandfather got here off the boat...
they gave him a scoop and a shovel.

2196
01:34:51,185 --> 01:34:53,119
Now I run the place.

2197
01:34:54,188 --> 01:34:55,450
America, huh?

2198
01:34:58,125 --> 01:35:08,433
'America, America,
God shed His grace on thee

2199
01:35:08,569 --> 01:35:19,173
'And crowned thy good with brotherhood
From sea to shining sea.

2200
01:35:19,413 --> 01:35:20,846
Let's try it one more time.

2201
01:35:23,350 --> 01:35:24,817
I'm gonna step out for a second.

2202
01:35:24,985 --> 01:35:28,079
If I'm not back,
do ''The Star-Spangled Banner'', okay?

2203
01:35:29,657 --> 01:35:31,682
I want to be able to hear you voice,
Warren.

2204
01:35:34,595 --> 01:35:35,960
Where the tell have you been?

2205
01:35:36,330 --> 01:35:38,764
I've been calling your apartment,
there were police.

2206
01:35:38,899 --> 01:35:39,388
They came here?

2207
01:35:39,567 --> 01:35:39,965
Oh yeah.

2208
01:35:40,101 --> 01:35:40,760
Big show.

2209
01:35:41,035 --> 01:35:42,764
The kids treated me like a TV star.

2210
01:35:43,003 --> 01:35:46,803
Bein' late with the rent is having
some problems, Nick.

2211
01:35:47,074 --> 01:35:50,134
Cops after you for robbery
is being seiously fucked up.

2212
01:35:50,311 --> 01:35:50,709
Listen--

2213
01:35:50,845 --> 01:35:51,470
No, you listen.

2214
01:35:51,912 --> 01:35:53,539
You know where Mom was this morning?

2215
01:35:53,848 --> 01:35:55,839
In church, praying for you.

2216
01:35:56,217 --> 01:35:59,186
You turn her into areligious fanatic,
Nicky, so help me--

2217
01:35:59,320 --> 01:36:00,048
Laurie.

2218
01:36:00,287 --> 01:36:01,948
I need you to do something for me.

2219
01:36:02,690 --> 01:36:03,987
We had a deal.

2220
01:36:04,959 --> 01:36:06,051
You remember?

2221
01:36:06,227 --> 01:36:07,216
After Tony died?

2222
01:36:07,394 --> 01:36:09,589
You and me against the world.

2223
01:36:12,166 --> 01:36:15,192
How come I'm always helping you out
and I never get anything back?

2224
01:36:15,669 --> 01:36:16,260
Well--

2225
01:36:16,437 --> 01:36:17,665
I helped you with that marriage deal.

2226
01:36:17,838 --> 01:36:19,305
You fucked up my engagement!

2227
01:36:19,473 --> 01:36:20,064
He was an asshole!

2228
01:36:20,241 --> 01:36:21,833
He was my asshole!

2229
01:36:22,109 --> 01:36:23,804
Hey, listen, listen, listen.

2230
01:36:24,044 --> 01:36:26,137
I'm gonna turn myself in, okay?

2231
01:36:26,347 --> 01:36:28,747
I just need to straighten
some things out first.

2232
01:36:29,483 --> 01:36:31,280
I think Dad might be in trouble.

2233
01:36:32,586 --> 01:36:35,578
Yeah, one of his apartment buildings
hurned down last night.

2234
01:36:35,756 --> 01:36:36,518
People were killed.

2235
01:36:36,690 --> 01:36:37,782
Yeah, I'd say he's got trouble.

2236
01:36:37,958 --> 01:36:41,394
I think it might be worse than that,
all right?

2237
01:36:42,329 --> 01:36:47,266
Now...no-now call him up,
be nice to him, you know?

2238
01:36:47,434 --> 01:36:48,901
Er, I don't know, talk or somethin'.

2239
01:36:49,036 --> 01:36:49,661
Why can't you do that?

2240
01:36:49,837 --> 01:36:50,462
I can't.

2241
01:36:50,638 --> 01:36:51,070
Why not?

2242
01:36:51,205 --> 01:36:52,103
Oh... !

2243
01:36:53,174 --> 01:36:54,232
I can't!

2244
01:36:58,646 --> 01:37:00,204
It doesn't work that way between us.

2245
01:37:01,582 --> 01:37:03,015
Please don't get hurt, Nick.

2246
01:37:04,718 --> 01:37:07,812
I was one of the first black mayors of
a major city in this country.

2247
01:37:08,622 --> 01:37:12,114
A lot of media pressure, millions of
people affected by my decisions.

2248
01:37:12,593 --> 01:37:15,790
But there was no way I could turn
my back on the people who put me in.

2249
01:37:16,230 --> 01:37:18,460
So I brought some of them along with me

2250
01:37:19,900 --> 01:37:21,367
And some of them messed up.

2251
01:37:22,736 --> 01:37:23,964
Well, they're only people.

2252
01:37:24,171 --> 01:37:25,138
They're human.

2253
01:37:26,040 --> 01:37:28,031
I let it go at first
because I didn't believe it,

2254
01:37:28,542 --> 01:37:31,170
and then because I didn't want
to believe it,

2255
01:37:31,545 --> 01:37:36,209
and finally because we would lose more
ground by cleaning house in public

2256
01:37:36,483 --> 01:37:38,451
than by sweeping it under the carpet.

2257
01:37:39,019 --> 01:37:41,544
It took twelve years for all that to
catch up with me.

2258
01:37:42,122 --> 01:37:44,613
That's a pretty nice run,
the way things these days.

2259
01:37:45,159 --> 01:37:47,150
You decided not to run again.

2260
01:37:47,394 --> 01:37:49,919
There were three Grand Jury indictments
hanging ovr my head.

2261
01:37:50,898 --> 01:37:53,992
If I stood for another term,
a lot of people would have gone,

2262
01:37:54,168 --> 01:37:55,157
and I would have gone down with them.

2263
01:37:56,070 --> 01:37:59,267
So...I should lie and hope for
twelve good years?

2264
01:37:59,440 --> 01:38:00,998
This isn't the Old Testament, Wynn.

2265
01:38:01,275 --> 01:38:04,108
People didn't vote you in
so you can test your moral fiber.

2266
01:38:04,645 --> 01:38:06,840
If you're going to be a leader, lead.

2267
01:38:07,615 --> 01:38:09,480
Take it to the Man every chance you get

2268
01:38:09,750 --> 01:38:11,479
This is not about a fight
with white people.

2269
01:38:12,386 --> 01:38:13,910
It's always about that, Wynn.

2270
01:38:14,588 --> 01:38:16,818
If it isn't,
you'fe just another ward heeler.

2271
01:38:17,424 --> 01:38:18,914
You don't defend anything.

2272
01:38:19,460 --> 01:38:21,052
You attack what's wrong.

2273
01:38:21,996 --> 01:38:23,588
That's what a leader is.

2274
01:38:31,038 --> 01:38:34,132
I worked so hard to get on the damn
Council, I never...thought about--

2275
01:38:34,308 --> 01:38:35,832
You have to know
how you're gonna play the green

2276
01:38:36,010 --> 01:38:37,739
when you're still back at the tee, Wynn

2277
01:38:37,978 --> 01:38:40,378
You just figure it out
when you get there.

2278
01:38:47,321 --> 01:38:48,447
Hey, Nick?

2279
01:38:53,861 --> 01:38:55,089
I figured you might be here.

2280
01:38:56,597 --> 01:38:58,588
This was always your favorite
hiding spot.

2281
01:38:59,967 --> 01:39:00,956
What do you want?

2282
01:39:03,037 --> 01:39:04,402
To see if you needed help.

2283
01:39:08,275 --> 01:39:09,708
What do you want to help me for?

2284
01:39:13,047 --> 01:39:16,574
Your brother must have saved my ass
a half dozen times over there.

2285
01:39:16,784 --> 01:39:18,183
And then your father.

2286
01:39:19,653 --> 01:39:21,120
When I got back I was pretty messed up.

2287
01:39:21,255 --> 01:39:21,880
This job has been a--

2288
01:39:22,056 --> 01:39:23,489
Hey, look, you don't owe me nothin'.

2289
01:39:23,624 --> 01:39:24,591
All right.

2290
01:39:26,593 --> 01:39:28,254
The offer stands though.

2291
01:39:29,330 --> 01:39:30,797
You need money?

2292
01:39:31,532 --> 01:39:33,159
Or a go-between?

2293
01:39:34,001 --> 01:39:35,491
I mean, after your friends
thrown you in--

2294
01:39:35,669 --> 01:39:36,931
Who said that?

2295
01:39:37,938 --> 01:39:38,597
The guard saw me.

2296
01:39:38,772 --> 01:39:40,433
What...what are you talkin' about?

2297
01:39:41,842 --> 01:39:46,472
The cop that came by here just said...
''His pal threw him in.''

2298
01:39:49,850 --> 01:39:51,147
Carl.

2299
01:39:51,518 --> 01:39:52,849
Fucking Carl !

2300
01:39:54,521 --> 01:39:55,613
What are you gonna do, Nicky?

2301
01:39:55,856 --> 01:39:57,084
I gotta find something out.

2302
01:39:57,758 --> 01:39:58,725
Hey -- thanks, man.

2303
01:39:58,859 --> 01:39:59,757
I owe you one.

2304
01:40:01,161 --> 01:40:02,185
Right.

2305
01:40:03,931 --> 01:40:04,727
Fuckin' kid.

2306
01:40:06,166 --> 01:40:07,633
How are you, uh...

2307
01:40:08,769 --> 01:40:10,236
How are your classes this year?

2308
01:40:11,205 --> 01:40:12,399
They're fine.

2309
01:40:13,707 --> 01:40:16,733
Sometimes, I, uh...I really miss it.

2310
01:40:18,445 --> 01:40:20,845
The classroom, the faculty politics.

2311
01:40:21,482 --> 01:40:25,919
Well it's a little bit tame now,
isn't it?

2312
01:40:26,086 --> 01:40:27,451
I know why you're here, Wynn.

2313
01:40:27,588 --> 01:40:28,748
Let's get on with it.

2314
01:40:29,623 --> 01:40:32,251
I understand why you want to
hold your ground on this thing.

2315
01:40:32,826 --> 01:40:33,690
Oh?

2316
01:40:33,827 --> 01:40:34,919
Why is that?

2317
01:40:35,496 --> 01:40:37,020
Because you're telling the truth.

2318
01:40:38,132 --> 01:40:40,259
But you're not gonna go to bat for me,
are you?

2319
01:40:41,335 --> 01:40:43,633
This is not about what I think is right

2320
01:40:43,804 --> 01:40:45,795
I have to represent the people
in my ward.

2321
01:40:45,973 --> 01:40:48,441
If I was black and they were white,
would that stop you?

2322
01:40:48,609 --> 01:40:50,975
Les there are two possibilities as to
what's going to happen.

2323
01:40:51,111 --> 01:40:54,774
Number one: If you drop the charges...
a few of the people at school,

2324
01:40:54,948 --> 01:40:58,475
not the ones that you respect the most,
will...whisper.

2325
01:40:59,219 --> 01:41:03,280
''Where there's smoke, there's fire.''
That you're gay.

2326
01:41:03,457 --> 01:41:05,084
That you must have made a move
on those boys.

2327
01:41:05,259 --> 01:41:07,318
Number two: If you push this thing,

2328
01:41:07,494 --> 01:41:10,327
those same accusations will come out
in the press,

2329
01:41:10,464 --> 01:41:14,867
in a court of law -- you're labelled
a homosexual and a racist.

2330
01:41:15,702 --> 01:41:17,795
And finally it comes down to
your word against theirs,

2331
01:41:17,971 --> 01:41:19,336
and it doesn't matter
what the verdict's gonna be

2332
01:41:19,473 --> 01:41:21,634
'cause those same people are gonna
still think that you're guilty.

2333
01:41:24,211 --> 01:41:28,978
Now...I can't stop any of that.

2334
01:41:29,817 --> 01:41:30,806
At all.

2335
01:41:35,322 --> 01:41:37,347
But if you do drop the charges...

2336
01:41:38,559 --> 01:41:41,619
I will do everything
I can to make it a clean break.

2337
01:41:45,866 --> 01:41:47,094
This stinks.

2338
01:41:49,002 --> 01:41:51,027
To high heaven.

2339
01:41:53,474 --> 01:41:56,341
'Balls to the wall, balls to the wall !

2340
01:41:56,477 --> 01:41:59,605
All or nothing, our balls to the wall !

2341
01:42:08,655 --> 01:42:10,919
Ehh! The fugitive.

2342
01:42:16,196 --> 01:42:17,424
You got a problem?

2343
01:42:17,598 --> 01:42:18,360
Yeah.

2344
01:42:18,599 --> 01:42:21,067
You. You fuckin' rolled over on me.

2345
01:42:21,635 --> 01:42:24,160
That's not a very nice thing to say,
Nick.

2346
01:42:24,872 --> 01:42:28,239
Now the way I see it, you stuck
your nose where it wasn't invited,

2347
01:42:28,375 --> 01:42:30,400
then your two little friends fucked up,

2348
01:42:30,577 --> 01:42:34,308
and even the dumbshit cops in this town
were smart enough to run U down for it.

2349
01:42:34,481 --> 01:42:34,947
Nah.

2350
01:42:35,115 --> 01:42:36,309
You rolled over on me.

2351
01:42:36,617 --> 01:42:38,278
They didn't have to
whack you with phone books,

2352
01:42:38,452 --> 01:42:39,942
they didn't have to
step on your fingers.

2353
01:42:40,120 --> 01:42:43,317
They walked in the fuckin' door
and you were ready to spill !

2354
01:42:43,824 --> 01:42:46,054
You rolled over on me
just like you did on Tony!

2355
01:42:46,226 --> 01:42:47,955
Don't talk to me about that old shit.

2356
01:42:48,996 --> 01:42:51,294
Your best fucking friend,
and you threw him in.

2357
01:42:51,465 --> 01:42:53,899
You think he was a fuckin' hero,
don't you?

2358
01:42:54,268 --> 01:42:55,235
Tony.

2359
01:42:55,836 --> 01:42:57,098
He was a punk.

2360
01:42:57,638 --> 01:43:00,664
Who do you think was drivin'
the fuckin' car that night?

2361
01:43:00,908 --> 01:43:04,742
Who was drivin' shitfaced and went up
on the curb and hit that woman?

2362
01:43:05,145 --> 01:43:08,239
Who ran away,
ran his little All-State ass away

2363
01:43:08,415 --> 01:43:10,474
and left me there
with my leg all fucked up

2364
01:43:10,651 --> 01:43:12,585
and that woman layin' on the ground?!

2365
01:43:12,819 --> 01:43:13,979
That's bullshit.

2366
01:43:14,354 --> 01:43:15,878
Ask your daddy, Nick.

2367
01:43:16,456 --> 01:43:17,980
Ask him what went down.

2368
01:43:20,327 --> 01:43:21,794
And get out of my way.

2369
01:43:22,062 --> 01:43:23,051
I'm closin' up.

2370
01:43:24,231 --> 01:43:25,459
That fire last night...

2371
01:43:25,799 --> 01:43:27,426
What about the fuckin' fire?

2372
01:43:27,634 --> 01:43:28,760
It was you, wasn't it?

2373
01:43:29,036 --> 01:43:30,060
You did it.

2374
01:43:31,371 --> 01:43:36,502
Like I said before, Nick ask your daddy

2375
01:43:36,777 --> 01:43:38,005
You fuckin' liar!

2376
01:43:49,156 --> 01:43:50,088
You fuck!

2377
01:43:52,092 --> 01:43:53,457
You finished, Nick?

2378
01:43:53,994 --> 01:43:56,758
'Cause if you're not, I'm gonna blow
your fuckin' brains out.

2379
01:44:02,903 --> 01:44:05,394
Dum dum dum, da-da-dah...

2380
01:44:05,572 --> 01:44:07,039
If any laws of any state are broken...

2381
01:44:07,174 --> 01:44:08,903
Dum dum dum, da-da-dahhh...

2382
01:44:09,076 --> 01:44:12,011
a duly-authorized organization springs
into action.

2383
01:44:12,145 --> 01:44:14,511
Dum dum dum dum dum dum, da-da-dah,
Dum dum dum dum dum dum, da-da-dah...

2384
01:44:14,648 --> 01:44:15,945
We may be called the stae police...

2385
01:44:16,116 --> 01:44:22,988
the state troopers...the militia,
the rangers...or the highway patrol.

2386
01:44:23,156 --> 01:44:24,680
Dum dum dum dum dum dum, da-da-dah,
Dum dum dum dum dum dum, da-da-dah...

2387
01:44:24,858 --> 01:44:27,918
These are stories...of the brave men...

2388
01:44:28,362 --> 01:44:33,322
whose training,
skill and courage have preserved

2389
01:44:33,500 --> 01:44:37,732
and enforced have enforced
and preserved our state laws.

2390
01:44:43,744 --> 01:44:45,006
Thank you.

2391
01:44:45,779 --> 01:44:54,414
Gentlemen -- brothers of the shield
I salute you and I bid you farewell.

2392
01:44:57,391 --> 01:44:58,517
You can't walk, kid.

2393
01:44:58,692 --> 01:45:02,219
Ehh who needs a wife when you got
this fuckin' guy on your case?

2394
01:45:02,663 --> 01:45:03,960
Ten-four, brothers!

2395
01:45:06,566 --> 01:45:07,897
I'll see you tomorrow.

2396
01:45:08,101 --> 01:45:08,999
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2397
01:45:09,136 --> 01:45:09,602
Early!

2398
01:45:09,770 --> 01:45:10,099
All right.

2399
01:45:10,270 --> 01:45:10,759
Hey, Mikey!

2400
01:45:10,937 --> 01:45:11,335
Hey.

2401
01:45:11,471 --> 01:45:11,869
Jerry!

2402
01:45:12,005 --> 01:45:12,596
Stand 'em up!

2403
01:45:12,773 --> 01:45:15,298
A round of drinks for all these olusy
beatwalkers here!

2404
01:45:18,679 --> 01:45:19,941
You hit the lottery, O'Brien?

2405
01:45:20,180 --> 01:45:22,148
I'm movin' up into the D.A.'s office.

2406
01:45:22,282 --> 01:45:23,647
Special lnvestigator.

2407
01:45:23,784 --> 01:45:24,944
That's great to hear.

2408
01:45:25,285 --> 01:45:27,685
All these years, suckin' up to the pols

2409
01:45:28,288 --> 01:45:30,153
I'd hate to think there's no payoff.

2410
01:45:32,959 --> 01:45:34,859
Everybody drinks but him.

2411
01:45:40,567 --> 01:45:44,333
I don't see why I gotta say
all that again.

2412
01:45:44,838 --> 01:45:47,102
People have to hear it with
their own ears.

2413
01:45:47,541 --> 01:45:49,008
I don't like sayin' it.

2414
01:45:49,643 --> 01:45:51,736
You ain't got nothin' to ashamed of,
do you?

2415
01:45:52,479 --> 01:45:54,470
The part about him tryin' to touch me.

2416
01:45:58,819 --> 01:45:59,615
Did he touch you?

2417
01:45:59,786 --> 01:46:00,844
No.

2418
01:46:02,989 --> 01:46:04,957
You know, you can tell me.

2419
01:46:06,793 --> 01:46:08,920
It don't mean a thing about you
if he did.

2420
01:46:09,096 --> 01:46:10,688
N-No.

2421
01:46:11,431 --> 01:46:13,160
But he did try to?

2422
01:46:13,467 --> 01:46:14,263
No.

2423
01:46:14,434 --> 01:46:16,629
I-I-I...I mean yes.

2424
01:46:20,040 --> 01:46:24,443
Desmond...what's the one thing
I tell you the most?

2425
01:46:24,845 --> 01:46:26,312
The one thing.

2426
01:46:27,214 --> 01:46:27,976
Be a man.

2427
01:46:28,148 --> 01:46:28,944
What?

2428
01:46:30,317 --> 01:46:31,511
Be a man!

2429
01:46:31,685 --> 01:46:33,312
And how you do that?

2430
01:46:33,620 --> 01:46:34,678
Stand up for youself.

2431
01:46:34,855 --> 01:46:35,583
No!

2432
01:46:35,756 --> 01:46:37,724
You stand up for what is right.

2433
01:46:43,063 --> 01:46:45,531
Baby, I'd dive down into hell to
keep you safe,

2434
01:46:45,665 --> 01:46:47,132
but you gotta be straight with me.

2435
01:46:48,735 --> 01:46:51,863
Now I'm gonna ask you one last time,
okay?

2436
01:47:01,114 --> 01:47:02,376
Whnn!

2437
01:47:02,649 --> 01:47:03,547
Excuse me.

2438
01:47:04,251 --> 01:47:04,945
Hi.

2439
01:47:05,118 --> 01:47:05,516
Hi.

2440
01:47:05,652 --> 01:47:06,346
You talked to him?

2441
01:47:06,720 --> 01:47:07,448
Uh-huh.

2442
01:47:07,621 --> 01:47:08,815
Did you believe him?

2443
01:47:09,356 --> 01:47:10,323
Yes.

2444
01:47:11,057 --> 01:47:12,251
What are you gonna do?

2445
01:47:13,393 --> 01:47:13,984
All right then!

2446
01:47:14,161 --> 01:47:16,721
If everybody'll please just grab
a chair and sit down

2447
01:47:17,297 --> 01:47:20,528
we're just waiting on Jeanette...
Price and her son.

2448
01:47:25,672 --> 01:47:27,299
But we can get started now.

2449
01:47:33,847 --> 01:47:35,838
It's nice to see all of
you concerned people here tonight.

2450
01:47:36,183 --> 01:47:37,445
I appreciate your support.

2451
01:47:38,885 --> 01:47:40,614
We have a lot to talk about tonight.

2452
01:47:41,054 --> 01:47:42,521
Desmond Price!

2453
01:47:42,722 --> 01:47:43,586
Tito Rollins!

2454
01:47:43,723 --> 01:47:46,590
Two of our young men have been accused
of a serious crime.

2455
01:47:46,793 --> 01:47:48,488
I've had all the charges dropped.

2456
01:47:48,662 --> 01:47:51,153
Their names will not appear on
any criminal record.

2457
01:47:58,071 --> 01:48:01,700
The root of the problem was another
overreaction by the police force.

2458
01:48:02,142 --> 01:48:03,575
At the next council meeting,

2459
01:48:04,044 --> 01:48:06,706
I will present a demand for
a Civilian Review Board

2460
01:48:06,880 --> 01:48:09,781
to investigate the death of
Hollis Washington...

2461
01:48:10,250 --> 01:48:12,514
and several other incidents
in the past year.

2462
01:48:12,686 --> 01:48:17,385
But more importantly...more importantly
we had a fire last night.

2463
01:48:17,557 --> 01:48:20,754
Thirteen of our families
were left homeless.

2464
01:48:21,194 --> 01:48:25,460
And resulted in the death of a young
woman and her three-month-old baby.

2465
01:48:26,199 --> 01:48:29,168
The city's response to this was pitiful

2466
01:48:29,302 --> 01:48:32,760
Instead of finding temporary shelters
and rehabilitating those apartments,

2467
01:48:32,939 --> 01:48:35,999
the city is pushing through a deal to
knock them down

2468
01:48:36,176 --> 01:48:40,579
and replace them with a high-income
condominium and a shopping mall !

2469
01:48:41,681 --> 01:48:44,616
Now when they needed our rent,
they jammed us in there,

2470
01:48:44,751 --> 01:48:47,276
they didn't turn the heat on
they didn't collect the garbage

2471
01:48:47,454 --> 01:48:50,116
they didn't provide street lights
or police protection

2472
01:48:50,290 --> 01:48:54,420
or any of the other services we should
have expected as residents of this city

2473
01:48:55,295 --> 01:49:00,927
But now...now...
now that they can smell a profit...

2474
01:49:01,635 --> 01:49:05,332
they want to burn us out
and plow us under.

2475
01:49:06,506 --> 01:49:09,669
They want to drive a wedge
through this community,

2476
01:49:09,843 --> 01:49:13,677
cut us up to pieces...
until we dry up and blow away.

2477
01:49:14,681 --> 01:49:16,012
See, I know what they're thinking.

2478
01:49:16,182 --> 01:49:17,615
I know what they're thinking.

2479
01:49:17,817 --> 01:49:20,581
See, they're thinking that we are just
a bunch of poor people,

2480
01:49:20,754 --> 01:49:23,279
a bunch of black people
and Hispanic people,

2481
01:49:23,456 --> 01:49:27,893
a bunch of people who just got off the
boat & can't get it together down here!

2482
01:49:28,028 --> 01:49:28,551
That's right.

2483
01:49:28,728 --> 01:49:29,820
People who don't even know how to
work together!

2484
01:49:29,996 --> 01:49:31,020
People who don't care!

2485
01:49:31,197 --> 01:49:32,357
People who don't count!

2486
01:49:32,532 --> 01:49:34,193
And people who don't even vote!

2487
01:49:34,367 --> 01:49:37,530
So I'm gonna ask you right now,
are we gonna prove them right?

2488
01:49:37,704 --> 01:49:41,470
Are we gonna lie down and take this?

2489
01:49:42,208 --> 01:49:45,541
Are we gonna allow them to push us
around, shut us down and burn us out?

2490
01:49:45,712 --> 01:49:48,180
No-o-o! ! !

2491
01:49:49,616 --> 01:49:56,317
Well, you know just three blocks
from here, up the hill...

2492
01:49:56,990 --> 01:49:59,982
the mayor and four councilmen

2493
01:50:00,160 --> 01:50:04,529
are attending a dinner to raise funds
for next November's campaign.

2494
01:50:06,633 --> 01:50:08,863
Now we were not invited.

2495
01:50:09,369 --> 01:50:11,667
Now I think we ought to go up there...

2496
01:50:11,838 --> 01:50:15,205
and let the mayor know just
how left out we feel !

2497
01:50:15,375 --> 01:50:16,342
Don't you?

2498
01:50:20,146 --> 01:50:23,809
I think we ought to go up there
and tell the mayor

2499
01:50:24,050 --> 01:50:26,678
that if he don't get his act together
real fast,

2500
01:50:26,853 --> 01:50:30,289
then he is the one who's gonna be left
out of the City Hall next election!

2501
01:50:30,423 --> 01:50:33,085
All right, let's do it!

2502
01:50:39,699 --> 01:50:40,529
Are they right behind me?

2503
01:50:40,700 --> 01:50:41,724
They're comin', baby.

2504
01:50:41,901 --> 01:50:42,367
All of them.

2505
01:50:42,535 --> 01:50:43,524
I hope I got the address right.

2506
01:50:43,703 --> 01:50:44,761
What are we going to do?

2507
01:50:45,405 --> 01:50:46,872
We'll figure that out when we get there

2508
01:51:17,404 --> 01:51:20,896
I have fought...at the municipal level

2509
01:51:21,241 --> 01:51:27,407
to provide corporate tax incentives...
to lure industry back to our city!

2510
01:51:28,381 --> 01:51:30,349
I have our city!

2511
01:51:30,483 --> 01:51:35,682
I have fought at the stae and federal
levels for funding to rebuild our roads

2512
01:51:35,855 --> 01:51:40,258
to light our streets,to keep the police
and firefighting forces up to strength!

2513
01:51:40,660 --> 01:51:45,996
But more importantly...
and this I take particular pride in

2514
01:51:46,132 --> 01:51:50,068
I have fought against
the environmental alarmists

2515
01:51:50,236 --> 01:51:54,502
and the special interest groups
that would block important developments

2516
01:51:54,674 --> 01:52:02,342
like the Galaxy Tower complex which
promise to revitalize our economy

2517
01:52:02,515 --> 01:52:05,712
and put our city back on the map!

2518
01:52:05,952 --> 01:52:08,318
And I intend to keep up this fight!

2519
01:52:09,222 --> 01:52:15,286
And with your help...we will once
more be a city with a future!

2520
01:52:16,062 --> 01:52:17,393
A city on the move!

2521
01:52:18,064 --> 01:52:20,328
Truly...a city of hope!

2522
01:52:37,450 --> 01:52:39,418
I've brought some concerned citizens.

2523
01:52:45,191 --> 01:52:47,159
They've been lookin' for you,
Mister Mayor.

2524
01:52:48,962 --> 01:52:50,429
You got a minute?

2525
01:53:02,642 --> 01:53:03,802
A little help?

2526
01:53:07,981 --> 01:53:08,948
Thanks.

2527
01:53:10,984 --> 01:53:12,508
You just gettin' out of work?

2528
01:53:12,919 --> 01:53:13,886
Nah.

2529
01:53:14,053 --> 01:53:14,951
Just goin' in.

2530
01:53:17,357 --> 01:53:18,517
It's a tough gig the night shift.

2531
01:53:18,691 --> 01:53:19,658
Yeah.

2532
01:53:20,393 --> 01:53:22,759
Ugh...your hand's messed up.

2533
01:53:24,464 --> 01:53:25,863
My life is messed up.

2534
01:53:25,999 --> 01:53:27,193
This is nothin'.

2535
01:53:27,901 --> 01:53:28,833
You play.

2536
01:53:28,968 --> 01:53:29,366
Nah.

2537
01:53:29,502 --> 01:53:30,298
I suck.

2538
01:53:35,241 --> 01:53:37,471
My brother used to try to teach me.

2539
01:53:37,744 --> 01:53:39,075
He was the real thing.

2540
01:53:39,612 --> 01:53:40,943
All-State guard.

2541
01:53:41,147 --> 01:53:42,045
Big deal.

2542
01:53:45,051 --> 01:53:46,143
Play around here?

2543
01:53:46,352 --> 01:53:47,512
Sacred Heart.

2544
01:53:48,188 --> 01:53:49,678
Tony Rinaldi.

2545
01:53:50,089 --> 01:53:51,522
Ohhh, snap!

2546
01:53:51,658 --> 01:53:52,716
Tony the Tiger!

2547
01:53:52,892 --> 01:53:53,517
Yeah!

2548
01:53:53,693 --> 01:53:54,660
I played against that dude.

2549
01:53:54,794 --> 01:53:56,056
Sucker was bad!

2550
01:53:56,229 --> 01:54:00,529
Fire off those Cazzie Russell jumpers,
no arc, bam-bam-bam!

2551
01:54:01,034 --> 01:54:02,467
He kill you with that jump shot.

2552
01:54:07,340 --> 01:54:08,602
Where'd he play in college?

2553
01:54:08,775 --> 01:54:10,106
Marines got him.

2554
01:54:10,276 --> 01:54:11,208
Yeah?

2555
01:54:11,344 --> 01:54:12,174
He go over?

2556
01:54:12,345 --> 01:54:13,437
Uh-huh.

2557
01:54:14,614 --> 01:54:15,911
I did that.

2558
01:54:18,017 --> 01:54:19,314
Infantry.

2559
01:54:21,354 --> 01:54:22,844
He make it back okay?

2560
01:54:23,489 --> 01:54:24,456
Nah.

2561
01:54:27,894 --> 01:54:29,828
Nice ball-handler, too.

2562
01:54:29,963 --> 01:54:31,123
He was fast for a white guy.

2563
01:54:31,898 --> 01:54:33,126
Not fast enough.

2564
01:54:37,170 --> 01:54:40,401
Hey, look, I, uh...I gotta run.

2565
01:54:41,574 --> 01:54:42,302
Take it easy, huh?

2566
01:54:42,475 --> 01:54:43,464
Yeah, you too.

2567
01:54:48,548 --> 01:54:50,175
Tony the Tiger.

2568
01:54:52,552 --> 01:54:53,917
What a waste.

2569
01:54:56,022 --> 01:54:56,579
--When you can have it all.

2570
01:54:56,756 --> 01:54:58,053
Why settle for less
when you can have it all?

2571
01:54:58,324 --> 01:54:59,882
Why settle for less
when you can have it all?

2572
01:55:00,393 --> 01:55:03,328
Why...why settle for less
when you can have it aaaall?

2573
01:55:03,463 --> 01:55:04,157
You can have it--

2574
01:55:04,330 --> 01:55:05,627
Why?

2575
01:55:05,798 --> 01:55:06,321
Why?

2576
01:55:06,499 --> 01:55:07,488
Why settle for less
when you can have it all?

2577
01:55:07,667 --> 01:55:08,099
Angela.

2578
01:55:08,234 --> 01:55:08,757
Angela Sabino.

2579
01:55:08,935 --> 01:55:10,061
Why settle for less
when you can have it all?

2580
01:55:10,403 --> 01:55:10,869
You can have it!

2581
01:55:11,004 --> 01:55:11,470
You can have it all !

2582
01:55:11,638 --> 01:55:12,161
Yeah, but...she might be front.

2583
01:55:12,338 --> 01:55:13,771
Why settle for less
when you can have it all?

2584
01:55:14,140 --> 01:55:17,735
All right,well,just tell her that I got
hung up but I'm on my way, all right?

2585
01:55:18,244 --> 01:55:19,074
Thanks.

2586
01:55:29,022 --> 01:55:30,046
Rinaldi.

2587
01:55:30,223 --> 01:55:31,281
I got a want on you, punk.

2588
01:55:31,457 --> 01:55:32,321
Yeah, stick it up your ass.

2589
01:55:32,492 --> 01:55:34,255
I'm not playin' around, asshole!

2590
01:55:34,427 --> 01:55:35,655
You do't have your little cop suit on.

2591
01:55:35,828 --> 01:55:36,556
I don't think y--

2592
01:56:08,294 --> 01:56:09,522
Freeze!

2593
01:56:09,696 --> 01:56:10,924
Lay your head down, pal !

2594
01:56:11,164 --> 01:56:12,256
It's me, you fucks!

2595
01:56:12,432 --> 01:56:13,364
Mike Rizzo!

2596
01:56:13,566 --> 01:56:15,261
You're lettin' that cocksucker get away

2597
01:56:16,703 --> 01:56:17,567
It's all right.

2598
01:56:17,737 --> 01:56:18,829
He's one of ours.

2599
01:56:19,472 --> 01:56:20,439
What's the fireworks for?

2600
01:56:20,606 --> 01:56:22,631
I had a suspect tryin'
to take my head off.

2601
01:56:22,875 --> 01:56:23,569
Armed?

2602
01:56:23,743 --> 01:56:25,540
He hit me with a fuckin' garbage pail !

2603
01:56:25,945 --> 01:56:28,607
Assault with a deadly trash receptacle.

2604
01:56:29,315 --> 01:56:30,441
Yeah, fuck you.

2605
01:56:31,351 --> 01:56:32,477
Come on, let's get him.

2606
01:56:36,422 --> 01:56:37,684
It's that punk, Nick Rinaldi.

2607
01:56:37,857 --> 01:56:39,051
We're supposed to pick him up.

2608
01:56:39,859 --> 01:56:41,827
They called the dogs off
on that guy, Mike.

2609
01:56:41,961 --> 01:56:42,586
What?!

2610
01:56:42,762 --> 01:56:44,491
He got a clean bill this afternoon.

2611
01:56:44,664 --> 01:56:45,323
Where were you?

2612
01:56:45,498 --> 01:56:48,626
Hey, that piece of yours, is it private
or on loan from the job?

2613
01:56:48,801 --> 01:56:50,268
It's mine!

2614
01:56:50,636 --> 01:56:51,364
You been drinkin', Mike?

2615
01:56:51,537 --> 01:56:52,128
What the fuck--?

2616
01:56:52,305 --> 01:56:52,930
You didn't hit him, did you?

2617
01:56:53,106 --> 01:56:54,164
He resisted arrest!

2618
01:56:54,340 --> 01:56:55,432
He wasn't wanted.

2619
01:56:55,808 --> 01:56:56,775
Did you read him the book first?

2620
01:56:56,943 --> 01:56:58,103
He's a piece of shit!

2621
01:56:58,444 --> 01:56:59,035
Did you hit him?

2622
01:56:59,212 --> 01:57:00,179
I don't know!

2623
01:57:05,518 --> 01:57:08,146
I suppose we could say
we were there in time to see,

2624
01:57:08,321 --> 01:57:10,255
and then that he went after you,
and then--

2625
01:57:10,390 --> 01:57:11,857
Hey, Paddy, I'm not goin' for this!

2626
01:57:12,058 --> 01:57:12,922
If this happened to you--

2627
01:57:13,092 --> 01:57:14,923
Then I'd deserve to get my ass
kicked off the force.

2628
01:57:15,094 --> 01:57:16,254
Accidents happen, kid.

2629
01:57:16,429 --> 01:57:17,794
We gotta close ranks here.

2630
01:57:17,964 --> 01:57:19,761
Well, I'm not goin' for it, period!

2631
01:57:20,900 --> 01:57:22,367
You mean you're not gonna back me up?

2632
01:57:24,203 --> 01:57:24,760
He's my partner.

2633
01:57:24,937 --> 01:57:26,234
What am I gonna do, shoot him?

2634
01:57:26,506 --> 01:57:27,768
Paddy you know me!

2635
01:57:28,474 --> 01:57:30,465
You'd better hand your piece up here,
Mike.

2636
01:57:31,878 --> 01:57:33,368
Oh, I don't believe this.

2637
01:57:33,713 --> 01:57:35,374
I don't believe you fuckin' guys!

2638
01:57:35,948 --> 01:57:36,710
What happens if he dies?

2639
01:57:36,883 --> 01:57:38,009
What happens to me?!

2640
01:57:38,418 --> 01:57:43,185
Mike...
do you believe in a Supreme Being?

2641
01:57:50,763 --> 01:57:52,230
How'd you find me here?

2642
01:57:52,565 --> 01:57:54,897
I saw your address in the police report

2643
01:57:55,168 --> 01:57:56,192
What do you want?

2644
01:57:57,303 --> 01:57:58,429
I want to talk.

2645
01:57:59,138 --> 01:57:59,968
Forget it.

2646
01:58:00,139 --> 01:58:01,037
Come on, man.

2647
01:58:01,207 --> 01:58:02,003
What?

2648
01:58:02,241 --> 01:58:03,299
You won.

2649
01:58:03,910 --> 01:58:04,433
Great.

2650
01:58:04,610 --> 01:58:05,872
You want to rub it in?

2651
01:58:06,245 --> 01:58:07,678
I'm sorry we fucked you up.

2652
01:58:07,980 --> 01:58:09,072
A little late for sorry.

2653
01:58:09,449 --> 01:58:11,383
I-I know you're not a faggot.

2654
01:58:14,053 --> 01:58:15,850
We've got a long way to go, don't we?

2655
01:58:17,423 --> 01:58:19,789
Look...I gotta run.

2656
01:58:23,229 --> 01:58:25,026
You mind if I hang with you a minute?

2657
01:58:25,631 --> 01:58:27,098
It's a free country.

2658
01:58:27,400 --> 01:58:28,924
Where'd you hear that one?

2659
01:58:30,536 --> 01:58:31,560
You're a teacher, huh?

2660
01:58:31,737 --> 01:58:32,396
Yeah.

2661
01:58:32,572 --> 01:58:33,732
What you teach?

2662
01:58:34,440 --> 01:58:35,907
Urban relations.

2663
01:58:36,142 --> 01:58:37,370
Yeah, well, what's that?

2664
01:59:23,322 --> 01:59:24,482
Who's that?

2665
01:59:25,358 --> 01:59:26,484
Nick?

2666
01:59:27,326 --> 01:59:28,418
Are you up there?

2667
01:59:59,926 --> 02:00:01,917
Riggs told me I might find you here.

2668
02:00:03,129 --> 02:00:05,154
I needed a place to rest.

2669
02:00:07,033 --> 02:00:08,933
I've been worried about you.

2670
02:00:11,537 --> 02:00:13,004
Worried?

2671
02:00:14,507 --> 02:00:17,067
Worried about what,
that the cops would pick me up?

2672
02:00:17,677 --> 02:00:19,440
Make you look bad in the papers?

2673
02:00:20,980 --> 02:00:22,345
I don't know.

2674
02:00:22,615 --> 02:00:25,277
You rob a place that belongs
to your family friend.

2675
02:00:25,451 --> 02:00:27,043
I mean what is that?

2676
02:00:28,154 --> 02:00:29,621
What, you need money?

2677
02:00:31,357 --> 02:00:33,052
You need money, you come to me!

2678
02:00:33,893 --> 02:00:35,121
And how do you make your money?

2679
02:00:35,294 --> 02:00:36,283
I don't steal it!

2680
02:00:36,462 --> 02:00:37,554
No?

2681
02:00:42,301 --> 02:00:44,826
I swore this wasn't gonna happen to you

2682
02:00:45,638 --> 02:00:47,003
Not after Tony.

2683
02:00:48,474 --> 02:00:50,442
I was gonna look after you.

2684
02:00:50,676 --> 02:00:51,700
How?

2685
02:00:52,144 --> 02:00:54,612
By chasing me into the Marines
like you did with him?

2686
02:00:54,847 --> 02:00:58,010
They were drunk and they stole a car!

2687
02:00:58,618 --> 02:01:01,553
And they hit somebody
and they left them in the street!

2688
02:01:03,322 --> 02:01:05,119
He wasn't a hero, Nick.

2689
02:01:06,926 --> 02:01:08,553
He ran away from it!

2690
02:01:09,528 --> 02:01:15,057
And he came to me and he wanted me to
cover for him!

2691
02:01:15,801 --> 02:01:17,564
I took him to the station.

2692
02:01:19,572 --> 02:01:20,937
Yeah.

2693
02:01:21,207 --> 02:01:23,198
Down to all your pals.

2694
02:01:23,809 --> 02:01:25,868
Nick, they would've found out.

2695
02:01:26,712 --> 02:01:30,512
They had the woman in the hospital
with a, with a broken back...

2696
02:01:31,150 --> 02:01:35,348
and his pal Carl in the hospital
just ready to spill his guts!

2697
02:01:37,890 --> 02:01:39,517
I did the best I could.

2698
02:01:40,626 --> 02:01:47,259
I got Tony a choice --
the service or jail !

2699
02:01:47,566 --> 02:01:49,124
Some fuckin' choice.

2700
02:01:49,402 --> 02:01:51,870
You think you get through life
without making choices like that?

2701
02:01:52,038 --> 02:01:53,733
You told him to go.

2702
02:01:59,245 --> 02:02:06,083
All my life...I thought that
I was the one in control.

2703
02:02:07,486 --> 02:02:09,920
I made sure I had the juice.

2704
02:02:10,423 --> 02:02:12,391
I had all the angles.

2705
02:02:15,895 --> 02:02:21,629
Jesus...I'm not in control of
a damn thing.

2706
02:02:22,234 --> 02:02:23,724
Did you come here to turn me in?

2707
02:02:24,637 --> 02:02:26,434
Nobody's after you, Nick.

2708
02:02:28,741 --> 02:02:30,402
I took care of that.

2709
02:02:31,310 --> 02:02:32,572
How?

2710
02:02:35,681 --> 02:02:37,979
I talked to some people and

2711
02:02:38,150 --> 02:02:39,549
You did a favor.

2712
02:02:41,520 --> 02:02:46,048
Yeah. I did a favor.

2713
02:02:46,525 --> 02:02:48,993
You had Carl burn down L Street!

2714
02:02:49,295 --> 02:02:51,388
Nicky, they were comin' after you.

2715
02:02:53,499 --> 02:02:56,434
They weren't gonna give you any choices

2716
02:02:57,837 --> 02:03:02,740
Daddy...those people,
they burned up in there!

2717
02:03:03,542 --> 02:03:07,808
I saw when they brought 'em out,
a-a girl and a little baby!

2718
02:03:08,347 --> 02:03:10,178
I let 'em do it.

2719
02:03:11,984 --> 02:03:14,248
Oh, Jesus Christ!

2720
02:03:15,321 --> 02:03:16,948
I let 'em do it!

2721
02:03:26,432 --> 02:03:27,729
Daddy?

2722
02:03:28,501 --> 02:03:30,469
I'm fucked up over here.

2723
02:03:34,140 --> 02:03:35,573
Nick!

2724
02:03:35,841 --> 02:03:36,967
You're bleeding!

2725
02:03:37,276 --> 02:03:39,301
Daddy my life is such a fuckin' mess.

2726
02:03:39,745 --> 02:03:40,712
Hold on.

2727
02:03:40,846 --> 02:03:41,437
I'll get help.

2728
02:03:41,714 --> 02:03:42,681
No, no, no, no!

2729
02:03:42,815 --> 02:03:43,213
What?

2730
02:03:43,382 --> 02:03:44,110
Stay with me, please?

2731
02:03:44,283 --> 02:03:45,045
Stay with me?

2732
02:03:45,217 --> 02:03:45,706
Please?

2733
02:03:45,885 --> 02:03:46,977
Don't leave me here alone.

2734
02:03:47,153 --> 02:03:48,017
Oh...okay.

2735
02:03:48,187 --> 02:03:48,710
All right.

2736
02:03:48,888 --> 02:03:49,616
I'm scared.

2737
02:03:49,789 --> 02:03:50,721
All right.

2738
02:03:50,956 --> 02:03:51,923
I'm scared.

2739
02:03:52,091 --> 02:03:52,989
Oh, God.

2740
02:03:53,826 --> 02:03:55,225
Nick--

2741
02:03:55,728 --> 02:03:56,695
Oh, Jesus!

2742
02:03:56,862 --> 02:03:57,328
It's bad.

2743
02:03:57,496 --> 02:03:57,962
No, no, no!

2744
02:03:58,130 --> 02:03:59,222
Wait, wait, wait, where you goin'?

2745
02:03:59,398 --> 02:04:00,092
Where you goin'?

2746
02:04:00,266 --> 02:04:01,665
I'm-I'm not going anywhere.

2747
02:04:02,701 --> 02:04:05,727
Now just...breathe easy, okay?

2748
02:04:05,905 --> 02:04:06,371
Okay.

2749
02:04:06,505 --> 02:04:07,164
Huh?

2750
02:04:07,339 --> 02:04:07,805
Take it easy.

2751
02:04:07,973 --> 02:04:08,962
Okay.

2752
02:04:09,275 --> 02:04:09,866
I'll be right back.

2753
02:04:10,042 --> 02:04:10,599
All right.

2754
02:04:10,776 --> 02:04:11,333
Stay there.

2755
02:04:11,510 --> 02:04:12,204
All right.

2756
