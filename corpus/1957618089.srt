Balfour, that should be it.

00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,754
The trust will take care of the hotel

if anything should happen to you,

10
00:02:29,174 --> 00:02:30,200
but as your banker I should tell you

11
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,380
that this is rather an unusual approach.

12
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:34,200
However, it does appear to be legal,

13
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,520
so we'll keep the title
deed safe in a deposit box

14
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,863
and you can keep the keys.

It's not good for your eyes, man.

129
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:14,330
- Hey, man, who's this girl here, man?

130
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:16,410
She look good, man.

131
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:18,060
Does she give you good head, man?

132
00:13:20,207 --> 00:13:21,457
- Thank you, man, thanks.

133
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:23,583
That was my best one.

134
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:26,680
I'm gonna have to work all night.

135
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,580
Stay away from this, Zippo.

Otherwise, you might not
like what you find, man.

Do you still send her money?

140
00:13:51,614 --> 00:13:53,580
- What's the matter with you, Johnny, huh?

141
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:55,033
You got nothing better to do?

142
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:57,250
- What's the matter?

143
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:04,463
Here you are in this great studio.

144
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,750
How long have you been here now, Carlos?

145
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:11,293
Seven months.

146
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:14,973
You owe me $10,000 rent.

147
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:19,270
First you think you're some kind of hero

148
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:23,240
because Time Magazine prints
your pictures of dead bodies.

149
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,510
Then you escape to America.

150
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:25,960
You think it's gonna be easy?

151
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:31,697
- You told me it was gonna be easy.

152
00:14:32,593 --> 00:14:33,844
- You start by making the girls

153
00:14:33,844 --> 00:14:36,449
take their clothes off, man, you know?

154
00:14:36,449 --> 00:14:39,014
- [Zippo] Yeah, yeah.

155
00:14:39,014 --> 00:14:41,144
- Take the clothes off.

156
00:14:41,144 --> 00:14:42,207
You cannot face up to your life, man.

157
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,633
One way, that is it.

158
00:14:55,182 --> 00:14:56,015
Carlos,

159
00:14:59,735 --> 00:15:01,735
don't fuck with me, huh?

160
00:15:03,927 --> 00:15:05,771
Otherwise, Rico here will give you a smile

161
00:15:05,771 --> 00:15:07,443
that's gonna narrow your face, man.

You work for Johnny.

00:18:30,986 --> 00:18:31,819
- Yeah.

183
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:39,773
Eat my steak.

184
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,060
- Hey, hey, wait a minute.

185
00:18:46,087 --> 00:18:49,440
(waiter retches)

186
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,543
- No, no, no, Mama, everything's okay.

187
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:55,920
I don't wanna talk about myself.

188
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:58,537
Yeah, Mama, I love you, too, bye bye.

189
00:19:10,425 --> 00:19:12,358
(knocking)

190
00:19:12,358 --> 00:19:13,961
It's open!

191
00:19:13,961 --> 00:19:16,461
(door creaks)

192
00:19:18,841 --> 00:19:21,758
(soft piano music)

193
00:19:35,361 --> 00:19:37,208
(dramatic musical flourish)

194
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:40,125
(soft piano music)

195
00:19:56,471 --> 00:19:57,471
- Oh, Byron.

196
00:20:05,217 --> 00:20:10,217
The king of terror seized her as his prey.

197
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:15,083
Not worth, no beauty of her life retained.

198
00:20:18,818 --> 00:20:21,401
(Louise sighs)

199
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:25,280
- You know Byron?
(Louise gasps)

200
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,113
- [Louise] Some.

201
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:29,120
I like your studio.

202
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,603
It's very nice.

203
00:20:32,449 --> 00:20:36,130
(soft piano music)

204
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:37,313
Do you need a model?

205
00:20:38,849 --> 00:20:39,682
- I doubt it.

206
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,385
So who sent you?

207
00:20:44,385 --> 00:20:45,218
Murray?

208
00:20:45,218 --> 00:20:49,987
- No, I just sort of got wind of you.

209
00:20:53,698 --> 00:20:54,531
The key.

210
00:20:54,531 --> 00:20:55,973
Wow, geez.

211
00:20:58,170 --> 00:20:59,593
This is really interesting.

212
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,380
Did you make it?

213
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:03,213
- Yeah.

214
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:05,600
You know, to pass the time.

215
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:09,490
- Where'd you find all these keys?

216
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:13,333
- The junk shop, anywhere.

217
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:15,243
Everywhere.

218
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:20,513
So, anyway, what have you done?

219
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,763
- Little here, little there, nothing much.

220
00:21:26,579 --> 00:21:27,412
I'm just starting.

221
00:21:27,412 --> 00:21:28,717
- You walked in here cold, right?

222
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:33,853
- Well, if you wanna put it that way.

223
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:45,090
- [Carlos] So you think
it's easy being a model?

224
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:50,330
Right, I try one roll.

225
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:54,083
But, here's the deal, anybody
want to work with you,

226
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:58,770
which is pretty unlikely,
I pay you regular rates.

227
00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:01,750
Otherwise, it's no deal.

228
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:07,063
- I think I can do it.

229
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:13,583
- [Carlos] Let's start.

230
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:16,410
So what's your name?

231
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,340
- [Louise] Louise.

232
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:45,833
- All right, you hold it just like that.

233
00:22:49,457 --> 00:22:51,957
(camera pops)

234
00:23:13,653 --> 00:23:15,560
You've got to move your
hair out of your face.

235
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,760
I can't see your eyes.

236
00:23:19,132 --> 00:23:21,632
(camera pops)

237
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,730
Change behind the screen.

238
00:23:40,556 --> 00:23:43,306
(soft pop music)

239
00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:02,200
Okay, these are playful, you know?

240
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,033
Real simple.

241
00:24:05,688 --> 00:24:06,521
Not too sexy.

242
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:10,843
If you can't do it, just humor me, okay?

243
00:24:12,082 --> 00:24:14,832
(soft pop music)

244
00:24:17,654 --> 00:24:18,487
Okay.

245
00:24:19,987 --> 00:24:22,487
(camera pops)

246
00:24:27,233 --> 00:24:28,085
Good.

247
00:24:28,085 --> 00:24:30,585
(camera pops)

248
00:24:32,487 --> 00:24:34,505
That's good, yeah.

249
00:24:34,505 --> 00:24:37,005
(camera pops)

250
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:55,083
Okay, now we do the beach scene.

251
00:24:55,083 --> 00:24:57,833
(soft pop music)

252
00:25:27,351 --> 00:25:28,184
Okay.

253
00:25:29,105 --> 00:25:31,348
Okay, relax.

254
00:25:31,348 --> 00:25:32,181
Good.

255
00:25:33,824 --> 00:25:36,324
(camera pops)

256
00:25:40,589 --> 00:25:42,168
Good.

257
00:25:42,168 --> 00:25:44,668
(camera pops)

258
00:26:04,355 --> 00:26:07,015
(whispering voice)

259
00:26:07,015 --> 00:26:09,227
- [Louise Voiceover] His
hands touched my breasts.

260
00:26:09,227 --> 00:26:12,227
(whispering voices)

261
00:26:15,928 --> 00:26:19,178
Stupid, so stupid, believing this shit.

262
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,280
- Tell me something.

263
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:26,193
The alcohol and the kissing,

264
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:29,843
does that make your job easier?

265
00:26:33,082 --> 00:26:35,999
You photographers are all the same.

266
00:26:37,149 --> 00:26:38,850
- Tell me who sent you, huh?

267
00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:40,070
Johnny?

268
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:41,273
- I don't think so.

269
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:46,313
- 24 exposures, time's up.

270
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:52,440
Give me your address
and your phone number.

271
00:26:58,962 --> 00:27:01,379
- [Louise Voiceover] The key.

272
00:27:02,758 --> 00:27:07,758
(bell rings)
(percussive music)

273
00:27:47,211 --> 00:27:48,557
- [Ghostly Voice] I can see the light.

274
00:27:49,434 --> 00:27:51,865
- [Louise] I can't believe I lost the key.

275
00:27:51,865 --> 00:27:52,938
- [Ghostly voice] Bad.

276
00:27:52,938 --> 00:27:55,938
(whispering voices)

277
00:28:03,652 --> 00:28:05,421
- Leave me alone!

278
00:28:05,421 --> 00:28:08,546
(whispering voices)

279
00:28:08,546 --> 00:28:09,658
Leave me alone.

280
00:28:09,658 --> 00:28:12,658
(whispering voices)

281
00:28:18,986 --> 00:28:22,569
(jazzy instrumental music)

282
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:38,393
- [Carlos] She looks good there, right?

283
00:30:39,479 --> 00:30:42,490
- [Man] The photography is
not so hot, but she is it.

284
00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:44,130
You've outdone yourself.

285
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:47,860
Christ, Carlos, where did you find her?

286
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:49,930
- She's just another model.

287
00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:51,410
- I had a girlfriend like this once.

288
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:52,243
Beautiful.

289
00:30:52,243 --> 00:30:53,990
Got into a car wreck.

290
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:56,800
Her face, it never quite set properly.

291
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:57,697
I mean, every time I looked at her,

292
00:30:57,697 --> 00:30:59,247
her jaw wouldn't come together,

293
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,850
and I was a little disgusted every time

294
00:31:01,850 --> 00:31:03,260
I would smile at her.

295
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:05,140
We were engaged, I had to get rid of her,

296
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:05,973
and that was it.

297
00:31:05,973 --> 00:31:07,660
This girl is perfect, and I want her

298
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:09,660
at the beach tomorrow morning, we shoot.

299
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,966
- I need an advance.

300
00:31:12,966 --> 00:31:16,973
- (sighs) Nine o'clock Friday morning,

301
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:20,030
but I want the negative.

302
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:22,430
I want her face out on
the street by tonight.

303
00:31:29,913 --> 00:31:32,747
- [Ghostly Voice] I need life.

304
00:31:32,747 --> 00:31:33,733
- [Ghostly Voice] Life!

305
00:31:33,733 --> 00:31:35,992
- [Ghostly Voice] Bring me back.

306
00:31:35,992 --> 00:31:38,807
(whispering voices)

307
00:31:38,807 --> 00:31:39,640
Feed us.

308
00:31:45,831 --> 00:31:47,886
- [Louise] Stupid, stupid.

309
00:31:47,886 --> 00:31:52,886
(whispering voices)
(jagged instrumental music)

310
00:31:59,213 --> 00:32:04,213
(banging)
(jagged instrumental music)

311
00:32:18,505 --> 00:32:20,344
(men chattering)

312
00:32:20,344 --> 00:32:21,177
(belching)

313
00:32:21,177 --> 00:32:22,843
- Henry, give me your
cigarette. Don't flick it.

314
00:32:22,843 --> 00:32:24,224
- I didn't, jerk off.
- Holy shit.

315
00:32:24,224 --> 00:32:25,850
- Get out of here.
- Guys, guys,

316
00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:28,850
I'm gonna see you later, okay?

317
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:30,807
- [Man] Shit, shit, shit.

318
00:32:30,807 --> 00:32:31,640
- Woo wee!

319
00:32:34,389 --> 00:32:36,123
Excuse me, excuse me.

320
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,013
Do you got a match?

321
00:32:46,570 --> 00:32:47,403
- Sure do

322
00:32:48,568 --> 00:32:49,863
if you got some cigarettes.

323
00:32:53,889 --> 00:32:55,289
- Well, this is my last one,

324
00:32:56,798 --> 00:32:59,893
but maybe there's another in the car.

325
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:07,880
- Well, if there ain't, you
could always take me for a ride.

326
00:33:09,565 --> 00:33:14,040
- [Henry Voiceover] Woo
whee, I am gonna like

327
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:16,543
raping you, you dumb little bitch.

328
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:20,520
If you're lucky, I may even give it to you

329
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:22,636
up your tight little butt.

330
00:33:22,636 --> 00:33:23,886
- Maybe, maybe.

331
00:33:24,953 --> 00:33:25,786
Sure.

332
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:28,617
Hop in, why don't you?

333
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:36,063
Shazam!

334
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:42,727
So now you tell me, what's a
pretty little girl like you

335
00:33:43,597 --> 00:33:45,533
doing out walking alone at night?

336
00:34:01,675 --> 00:34:03,720
- Why don't you just drive
on to a grocery store

337
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,113
and get us some cigarettes?

338
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:09,410
- [Henry Voiceover] Man,
something about the way

339
00:34:09,410 --> 00:34:12,513
she talks makes me
wanna fuck her real bad,

340
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:15,453
cutting her a little more than usual.

341
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:19,133
Take the tip off her cute little nose.

342
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:29,870
- Tell me something,
do you mind if I touch

343
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:32,373
those cute little fangs of yours?

344
00:34:43,978 --> 00:34:46,228
(car revs)

345
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:48,201
Off we go.

346
00:34:48,201 --> 00:34:51,868
(jagged instrumental music)

347
00:34:59,170 --> 00:35:00,400
- Yeah, I took that shot, huh?

348
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,783
It's my first ad, what do you think?

349
00:35:01,783 --> 00:35:04,760
- Well, I think it's absolutely unique.

350
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:09,079
I think there's an extraordinary
creative feeling about it.

351
00:35:09,079 --> 00:35:11,610
It has an ambience and it's very akin

352
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:15,437
to a sort of system called linearism,

353
00:35:16,438 --> 00:35:19,830
which is lines, as opposed to
pointillism, which is dots.

354
00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:22,340
There is a mystique about it.

355
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:26,377
The whole ambience comes
right through the creativity.

356
00:35:26,377 --> 00:35:28,069
It really hits you.

357
00:35:28,069 --> 00:35:31,069
(bright rock music)

358
00:35:46,591 --> 00:35:48,924
- [Henry] Well, here we are.

359
00:35:49,946 --> 00:35:51,271
- [Louise Voiceover] Kissing me.

360
00:35:51,271 --> 00:35:54,271
(whispering voices)

361
00:35:57,446 --> 00:35:59,983
Touching my breasts, touching my breasts.

362
00:35:59,983 --> 00:36:02,983
(whispering voices)

363
00:36:05,092 --> 00:36:06,502
So stupid, so stupid.

364
00:36:06,502 --> 00:36:09,502
(whispering voices)

365
00:36:14,487 --> 00:36:16,383
- [Henry] Now don't squirm, okay?

366
00:36:18,834 --> 00:36:23,834
- Henry, Henry! (giggles)

367
00:36:28,410 --> 00:36:30,810
- [Henry] Just shut up

368
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:35,371
or I'll cut your stinking little nose off.

369
00:36:35,371 --> 00:36:38,038
(Louise laughs)

370
00:36:47,627 --> 00:36:49,093
- Holy cow, Henry!

371
00:36:52,330 --> 00:36:54,230
How old were you when you first raped?

372
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,603
You were eight years old.

373
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:00,909
- Shut up!
- Isn't that right?

374
00:37:00,909 --> 00:37:02,194
- Bitch!

375
00:37:02,194 --> 00:37:04,540
(Louise chuckles)

376
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:07,987
- Oh, poor Nelly on that farm next to you.

377
00:37:07,987 --> 00:37:10,890
- [Henry] You dirty whore,
who have you been talking to?

378
00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:13,170
- Broke her neck afterwards, didn't you?

379
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:17,433
Told everyone she fell. (laughs)

380
00:37:18,930 --> 00:37:19,770
But why, Henry?

381
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:23,980
She would've done it
with you anyway. (laughs)

382
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:26,169
She liked you.

383
00:37:26,169 --> 00:37:27,857
She thought you had pretty eyes.

384
00:37:28,745 --> 00:37:31,877
- Now I am definitely going to kill you.

385
00:37:31,877 --> 00:37:34,227
I am definitely going to kill you!

386
00:37:34,227 --> 00:37:36,977
I'm definitely going to kill you!

387
00:37:38,824 --> 00:37:39,657
- Shut up.

388
00:37:42,088 --> 00:37:44,689
I'm gonna take some
weight off your shoulders.

389
00:37:44,689 --> 00:37:45,760
- [Henry] No.

390
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:46,593
(neck cracks)
(Louise grunts)

391
00:37:46,593 --> 00:37:48,154
(whispering voices)

392
00:37:48,154 --> 00:37:49,640
- [Louise Voiceover] Love, love, love.

393
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:50,473
(whispering voices)

394
00:37:50,473 --> 00:37:51,723
Stupid, stupid.

395
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:54,192
- [Man Voiceover] Goodbye, goodbye.

396
00:37:54,192 --> 00:37:57,192
(whispering voices)

397
00:38:17,358 --> 00:38:19,732
(soft instrumental music)

398
00:38:19,732 --> 00:38:22,815
(electricity buzzes)

399
00:38:47,064 --> 00:38:49,359
- First time to make money off my work,

400
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:51,491
and I don't even remember her name.

401
00:38:51,491 --> 00:38:52,853
I'm such an asshole.

402
00:38:52,853 --> 00:38:55,686
(soft rock music)

403
00:40:08,286 --> 00:40:10,453
(banging)

404
00:40:19,607 --> 00:40:21,103
- Did you sell my pictures?

405
00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:26,530
- No, I sold someone else's picture.

406
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:49,763
- Carlos, do you think I'm pretty?

407
00:40:53,890 --> 00:40:57,140
- [Carlos] Sure, I think you're pretty.

408
00:41:00,655 --> 00:41:03,177
- Do you like my body?

409
00:41:03,177 --> 00:41:08,177
- [Carlos] Come on, Mandy, what is this?

410
00:41:12,269 --> 00:41:14,936
- Carlos, why don't you like me?

411
00:41:17,019 --> 00:41:17,852
Baby.

412
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:22,190
We could be so good for each other.

413
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,830
I could cook for you.

414
00:41:30,598 --> 00:41:32,098
I can turn you on.

415
00:41:33,883 --> 00:41:35,757
- [Louise Voiceover] Stupid, stupid.

416
00:41:35,757 --> 00:41:37,793
(whispering voices)

417
00:41:37,793 --> 00:41:39,793
- Move out of this place

418
00:41:42,509 --> 00:41:45,259
and come and live at my sister's.

419
00:41:48,235 --> 00:41:50,902
- I just can't move out of here.

420
00:41:57,695 --> 00:41:59,445
- All these problems.

421
00:42:03,388 --> 00:42:07,721
Do there have to be all
these problems all the time?

422
00:42:14,763 --> 00:42:17,680
Come and live with Jeanette and me.

423
00:42:18,962 --> 00:42:20,797
- Tell me!
- We use each other.

424
00:42:20,797 --> 00:42:25,797
(shouting voices)
(whispering voices)

425
00:42:32,988 --> 00:42:35,155
(panting)

426
00:42:36,024 --> 00:42:38,123
- [Mandy] Come inside me.

427
00:42:38,123 --> 00:42:39,373
Come inside me.

428
00:42:41,383 --> 00:42:42,716
That's it, baby.

429
00:42:48,936 --> 00:42:52,686
You don't care, you
don't care about sharing!

430
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:58,697
- Come on, Mandy, get up off the counter.

431
00:42:59,616 --> 00:43:01,417
- [Mandy] You say that I'm the one.

432
00:43:01,417 --> 00:43:02,860
(whispering voices)

433
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:03,844
But it's not me.

434
00:43:03,844 --> 00:43:04,761
Stop, quit!

435
00:43:08,065 --> 00:43:09,440
You're spoiled, Carlos.

436
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:12,785
- That's right, that's
fucking right, Mandy!

437
00:43:12,785 --> 00:43:16,280
(whispering voices)

438
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:18,251
- We use each other.
- No, no, no, no.

439
00:43:18,251 --> 00:43:21,084
(shouting voices)

440
00:43:22,929 --> 00:43:26,762
(percussive electronic music)

441
00:43:56,330 --> 00:43:57,930
- Carlos, you disturb my gaming.

442
00:43:58,833 --> 00:44:00,483
What is the matter with you, huh?

443
00:44:06,566 --> 00:44:08,230
She very nice, so what?

444
00:44:08,230 --> 00:44:09,960
- So what, Johnny, you tell me.

445
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:11,453
You send her to me or no?

446
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:20,942
- You think I'm gonna send a
girl like this to you, man?

447
00:44:20,942 --> 00:44:22,858
(Johnny chuckles)

448
00:44:22,858 --> 00:44:23,941
You're crazy.

449
00:44:25,155 --> 00:44:25,988
- Just give me the picture back, man,

450
00:44:25,988 --> 00:44:27,430
come on.
- Wait.

451
00:44:27,430 --> 00:44:28,263
Let me see it.

452
00:44:32,702 --> 00:44:33,652
Did you shoot this?

453
00:44:36,504 --> 00:44:40,100
It's out of focus.

454
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:40,933
But still,

455
00:44:43,705 --> 00:44:48,705
she looks good enough on the outside.

456
00:44:50,041 --> 00:44:52,874
But what's she like on the inside?

457
00:44:53,790 --> 00:44:57,790
(screeching instrumental music)

458
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:05,410
(panting) Who is she?

459
00:45:05,410 --> 00:45:06,597
What is she?

460
00:45:09,241 --> 00:45:13,193
(panting) Real angry lady, man.

461
00:45:14,454 --> 00:45:16,704
(grunting)

462
00:45:19,154 --> 00:45:22,077
The stench!

463
00:45:22,077 --> 00:45:22,994
The stench.

464
00:45:24,344 --> 00:45:25,761
That's easy cash.

465
00:45:28,356 --> 00:45:29,606
But the stench.

466
00:45:30,665 --> 00:45:32,915
(rattling)

467
00:45:36,348 --> 00:45:39,681
(droning ambient music)

468
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:52,360
My first reading's free.

469
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,903
You consult me twice, you pay the price.

470
00:46:00,123 --> 00:46:01,456
100 bucks a pop.

471
00:46:03,994 --> 00:46:07,065
- [Louise Voiceover] Save the key.

472
00:46:07,065 --> 00:46:08,513
- [Ghostly Voice] Key.

473
00:46:08,513 --> 00:46:12,096
(funky instrumental music)

474
00:46:26,324 --> 00:46:27,407
Save the key.

475
00:46:45,172 --> 00:46:48,089
(lightning cracks)

476
00:46:52,931 --> 00:46:55,431
(doors creak)

477
00:47:00,149 --> 00:47:03,066
(whispering voice)

478
00:47:59,701 --> 00:48:02,284
(wind rustles)

479
00:48:05,241 --> 00:48:10,241
(whispering voice)
(tinkling piano music)

480
00:48:27,846 --> 00:48:28,679
It's time.

481
00:48:32,961 --> 00:48:33,794
Help me.

482
00:48:38,190 --> 00:48:41,107
(whispering voice)

483
00:48:46,524 --> 00:48:48,305
- [Man] Hey, kid, need some help?

484
00:48:48,305 --> 00:48:50,996
(screeching instrumental music)

485
00:48:50,996 --> 00:48:52,079
Are you okay?

486
00:48:55,910 --> 00:48:57,867
- No, I'm fine, thank you.

487
00:49:11,513 --> 00:49:14,013
(phone rings)

488
00:49:17,157 --> 00:49:18,580
- [Bud] Carlos, this is it.

489
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:21,927
I want that $500 tomorrow, tomorrow!

490
00:49:25,679 --> 00:49:28,179
(phone rings)

491
00:49:30,495 --> 00:49:31,350
(beeping)

492
00:49:31,350 --> 00:49:35,970
- [Girl] Carlos, Carlos, thank
you so much for my dress.

493
00:49:35,970 --> 00:49:37,330
I love it.

494
00:49:37,330 --> 00:49:40,360
Mama's mad, she says it's too sexy,

495
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:43,900
but I'm so glad, I miss you so much.

496
00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:46,570
It's only half a birthday without you,

497
00:49:46,570 --> 00:49:49,340
but I love my dress, so get rich soon

498
00:49:49,340 --> 00:49:51,300
so you can send for me.

499
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:56,300
I want to go to school
in America badly, badly.

500
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:58,190
I got to go now.

501
00:49:58,190 --> 00:49:59,747
I love you, I love you.

502
00:50:16,481 --> 00:50:20,064
(pulsing electronic music)

503
00:51:51,243 --> 00:51:53,698
- You're having a bad trip, you know.

504
00:51:53,698 --> 00:51:56,531
(Carlos chuckles)

505
00:52:00,570 --> 00:52:02,763
- I was missing my little sister.

506
00:52:06,023 --> 00:52:07,770
I thought I'd died and she'd gone,

507
00:52:07,770 --> 00:52:09,113
I'd never see her again.

508
00:52:13,064 --> 00:52:16,051
No, she's lost. (laughs)

509
00:52:16,051 --> 00:52:18,468
And I was trying to find her.

510
00:52:20,711 --> 00:52:22,324
- I'm lost, too.

511
00:52:22,324 --> 00:52:24,068
Maybe you can find me.

512
00:52:24,068 --> 00:52:27,651
(pulsing electronic music)

513
00:52:37,824 --> 00:52:39,607
- [Ghostly Voice] Help me.

514
00:52:39,607 --> 00:52:42,524
(whispering voice)

515
00:52:49,203 --> 00:52:53,703
(panting)
(gibbering)

516
00:53:19,157 --> 00:53:22,240
(electricity buzzes)

517
00:53:23,650 --> 00:53:27,233
(pulsing electronic music)

518
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:48,813
- You know what?

519
00:53:49,992 --> 00:53:50,825
- Tell me.

520
00:53:53,938 --> 00:53:55,873
- You know, we both have
something in common.

521
00:53:58,554 --> 00:54:00,204
We're both looking for something.

522
00:54:02,905 --> 00:54:06,478
- We're both looking for ourselves, right?

523
00:54:06,478 --> 00:54:07,311
- Yeah.

524
00:54:10,811 --> 00:54:13,465
Except for I think it's
time to change our luck.

525
00:54:13,465 --> 00:54:17,048
(pulsing electronic music)

526
00:54:26,218 --> 00:54:28,219
Listen, I'll see you later, okay?

527
00:54:28,219 --> 00:54:31,802
(pulsing electronic music)

528
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:48,143
- Who's gonna help find me now?

529
00:54:50,333 --> 00:54:53,916
(eerie instrumental music)

530
00:55:07,546 --> 00:55:09,713
(banging)

531
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:13,323
- It's open.

532
00:55:14,295 --> 00:55:16,795
(door creaks)

533
00:55:18,670 --> 00:55:19,520
- [Louise] Hello.

534
00:55:21,410 --> 00:55:22,243
I'm back.

535
00:55:31,210 --> 00:55:33,863
- You should've given me
your telephone number.

536
00:55:35,428 --> 00:55:37,928
(Louise gags)

537
00:55:38,780 --> 00:55:40,780
I can't work with that kind of attitude.

538
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,310
Tell me something, you come in here

539
00:55:45,310 --> 00:55:48,840
like something the cat drug in,

540
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:50,003
you're unreliable,

541
00:55:51,340 --> 00:55:53,340
and, for some reason, I
always get this feeling

542
00:55:53,340 --> 00:55:54,993
like you're lying to me,

543
00:55:56,920 --> 00:56:01,200
so tell me, why should I give you a break?

544
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:04,663
- Carlos, cut the crap.

545
00:56:10,110 --> 00:56:11,363
- Look into my eyes.

546
00:56:12,890 --> 00:56:13,763
- What is this?

547
00:56:17,530 --> 00:56:19,863
- Just come here and look into my eyes.

548
00:56:22,253 --> 00:56:23,270
- I would just like to use your bathroom.

549
00:56:23,270 --> 00:56:25,020
- Just tell me what you see, first.

550
00:56:30,940 --> 00:56:32,897
- I see a frustrated little boy.

551
00:56:35,089 --> 00:56:37,922
(Louise chuckles)

552
00:56:38,796 --> 00:56:39,796
- Very good.

553
00:56:43,850 --> 00:56:45,450
Are you in some kind of trouble?

554
00:56:47,013 --> 00:56:50,820
- No, I would just like to
powder my nose and leave.

555
00:56:50,820 --> 00:56:52,760
What do you want from me?

556
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:54,960
- I want to know why
you want to be a model.

557
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:58,763
I mean, a girl like you could do anything.

558
00:57:00,910 --> 00:57:03,313
There's no creativity in modeling,

559
00:57:04,190 --> 00:57:05,710
there's no heart in it.

560
00:57:05,710 --> 00:57:09,650
- Well, at least you're not trying

561
00:57:09,650 --> 00:57:11,043
to sell me on the glamor.

562
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:18,390
I think that might be the
first honest thing you've said.

563
00:57:23,260 --> 00:57:24,093
I'll tell you.

564
00:57:30,860 --> 00:57:34,013
I want to become the ultimate object.

565
00:57:35,572 --> 00:57:38,743
- (snorts) You're very funny.

566
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:46,350
I tell you what, I give you a break,

567
00:57:46,350 --> 00:57:47,763
but on my terms.

568
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:51,723
You get here exactly 9:30 every morning.

569
00:57:53,860 --> 00:57:57,053
You give me your address,
your phone number,

570
00:57:58,240 --> 00:57:59,913
your mother's phone number.

571
00:58:00,890 --> 00:58:02,890
That way, I can always get ahold of you.

572
00:58:04,717 --> 00:58:09,384
And if you ever mess
with me, you're fired.

573
00:58:09,384 --> 00:58:12,217
(Louise chuckles)

574
00:58:14,580 --> 00:58:17,703
- These are the terms.

575
00:58:18,930 --> 00:58:21,300
We work only at night.

576
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:22,870
No locations.

577
00:58:22,870 --> 00:58:26,010
I don't want to meet any of your clients.

578
00:58:26,010 --> 00:58:28,640
You don't get my telephone number,

579
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:30,680
and you don't get my address.

580
00:58:31,757 --> 00:58:33,620
And if you ever see my after work,

581
00:58:33,620 --> 00:58:36,713
you will never see me again.

582
00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:45,260
And, on that note, when
do you wanna start?

583
00:58:49,185 --> 00:58:51,160
- I'll see you tomorrow, Louise.

584
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:52,273
- Oh, one more thing,

585
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:55,023
did you find a small key?

586
00:58:56,590 --> 00:58:58,173
I may have lost it here.

587
00:58:59,140 --> 00:58:59,973
- No.

588
00:59:01,190 --> 00:59:02,023
- Carlos.

589
00:59:03,090 --> 00:59:03,923
- [Carlos] Yes?

590
00:59:07,180 --> 00:59:09,393
- When a girl asks to use your bathroom,

591
00:59:11,580 --> 00:59:13,220
you shouldn't keep her waiting.

592
00:59:43,507 --> 00:59:45,455
- [Ghostly Voice] Help me.

593
00:59:45,455 --> 00:59:48,372
(whispering voice)

594
00:59:50,395 --> 00:59:52,145
Restore me.
- I can't.

595
00:59:54,796 --> 00:59:56,481
Not anymore.

596
00:59:56,481 --> 00:59:59,481
(whispering voices)

597
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:03,680
- No, huh?

598
01:00:08,470 --> 01:00:10,890
- Look, Bud, you've already give me $500,

599
01:00:10,890 --> 01:00:12,590
which I can't give back right now.

600
01:00:14,073 --> 01:00:15,790
But if you give me the
lingerie for the shoot,

601
01:00:15,790 --> 01:00:17,873
I come back tomorrow with contact sheet.

602
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:19,983
You got nothing to lose.

603
01:00:21,470 --> 01:00:24,810
- What insane asylum
did you rent this girl

604
01:00:24,810 --> 01:00:26,133
from anyway, Carlos?

605
01:00:28,954 --> 01:00:31,110
- Bud, look, I got two
weeks' worth of work

606
01:00:31,110 --> 01:00:32,850
lined up with this girl.

607
01:00:32,850 --> 01:00:34,270
Her picture, it gets all over town,

608
01:00:34,270 --> 01:00:36,243
it's gonna cost you twice as much, man.

609
01:00:37,870 --> 01:00:39,690
- You know I don't care about that.

610
01:00:41,900 --> 01:00:44,983
I like to meet the models
that are gonna work for me!

611
01:00:45,870 --> 01:00:49,163
Give them a few tips, that's all.

612
01:00:50,090 --> 01:00:52,340
- Everybody else has
agreed to the terms, man.

613
01:00:52,340 --> 01:00:54,347
Nobody gets to meet her.

614
01:00:57,560 --> 01:00:59,180
- All right, Carlos, I can't tell you

615
01:00:59,180 --> 01:01:02,513
how you're really starting
to fucking bug me, okay!

616
01:01:02,513 --> 01:01:04,070
I don't like playing these games.

617
01:01:04,070 --> 01:01:06,477
Now take that and get outta here!

618
01:01:06,477 --> 01:01:09,977
(dramatic piano flourish)

619
01:01:16,359 --> 01:01:20,026
(tinkling electronic music)

620
01:02:07,385 --> 01:02:08,551
(knocking)

621
01:02:08,551 --> 01:02:12,134
(pulsing electronic music)

622
01:02:13,262 --> 01:02:14,857
(knocking)

623
01:02:14,857 --> 01:02:18,440
(pulsing electronic music)

624
01:02:27,578 --> 01:02:28,941
(door creaks)

625
01:02:28,941 --> 01:02:32,524
(pulsing electronic music)

626
01:02:40,645 --> 01:02:42,145
- [Johnny] Carlos.

627
01:02:43,243 --> 01:02:44,570
I see your model is back

628
01:02:45,570 --> 01:02:47,520
and you're working again.

629
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:48,720
That's nice, man.

630
01:02:49,790 --> 01:02:52,440
- Johnny, I'm right in the middle of it.

631
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:53,583
I see you tomorrow.

632
01:02:54,700 --> 01:02:57,952
- Rico, tell me something, didn't we

633
01:02:57,952 --> 01:03:00,070
already have to come back, man?

634
01:03:00,070 --> 01:03:01,170
- We sure did, Johnny.

635
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:04,550
- [Carlos] Louise, please, excuse us.

636
01:03:04,550 --> 01:03:05,760
You can wait in the kitchen.

637
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:08,110
- Carlos, there is no
need to bother your work.

638
01:03:09,515 --> 01:03:10,765
Just the money.

639
01:03:11,923 --> 01:03:13,340
Let her leave us.

640
01:03:15,289 --> 01:03:18,480
(Johnny speaks indistinctly)

641
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:20,793
- I don't think I
understand your game here.

642
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:24,263
- [Johnny] It's very simple.

643
01:03:25,987 --> 01:03:27,320
I need my money.

644
01:03:29,008 --> 01:03:31,030
- Maybe you should ask Zippo about it.

645
01:03:31,030 --> 01:03:31,873
- Ask me, man?

646
01:03:33,356 --> 01:03:34,673
What are you talking about, man?

647
01:03:36,390 --> 01:03:39,790
I don't know nothing, man, you understand?

648
01:03:41,039 --> 01:03:42,989
- Perhaps you can enlighten me, Carlos.

649
01:03:45,360 --> 01:03:47,780
- Somebody broke into
my apartment last night

650
01:03:47,780 --> 01:03:48,730
and burnt my money.

651
01:03:49,773 --> 01:03:52,023
(laughing)

652
01:04:00,300 --> 01:04:01,327
- You should write books, man.

653
01:04:01,327 --> 01:04:02,927
You got great stories, you know?

654
01:04:04,950 --> 01:04:08,427
Carlos, we are now
(speaking foreign language).

655
01:04:10,490 --> 01:04:12,560
I gave you a break.

656
01:04:12,560 --> 01:04:13,760
You live better than me.

657
01:04:14,690 --> 01:04:17,587
And now you're trying to
insult my fucking intelligence!

658
01:04:18,736 --> 01:04:21,450
(speaking foreign language)

659
01:04:21,450 --> 01:04:24,653
When you don't pay, I gotta pay, Johnny.

660
01:04:25,793 --> 01:04:28,043
(grunting)

661
01:04:29,250 --> 01:04:33,575
You got one more day, Carlos, huh, okay?

662
01:04:33,575 --> 01:04:36,150
(grunting)

663
01:04:36,150 --> 01:04:37,023
Warn him, Rico.

664
01:04:43,890 --> 01:04:46,873
- Bet you couldn't do
that with a kitchen knife.

665
01:04:48,473 --> 01:04:51,347
I think Carlos has had enough, don't you?

666
01:04:53,377 --> 01:04:55,593
- This is the most exciting
night I've had in a week.

667
01:04:56,770 --> 01:04:57,603
Okay.

668
01:04:58,820 --> 01:04:59,653
Let him go.

669
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:02,693
- Say goodbye to your buddies.

670
01:05:03,826 --> 01:05:06,850
- It turns me on when
you breathe in my ear.

671
01:05:06,850 --> 01:05:07,700
- Don't force me.

672
01:05:10,273 --> 01:05:13,010
It gets me too excited.

673
01:05:13,010 --> 01:05:15,810
- Okay, the fun is over.

674
01:05:15,810 --> 01:05:16,977
Everybody out.

675
01:05:28,847 --> 01:05:31,680
Carlos, the rules remain the same.

676
01:05:35,240 --> 01:05:37,647
Tomorrow, or you're history.

677
01:05:44,559 --> 01:05:45,726
Adios, Carlos.

678
01:05:55,312 --> 01:05:56,312
- Is it bad?

679
01:05:57,860 --> 01:05:59,663
- I think we got some good pictures.

680
01:06:01,210 --> 01:06:02,410
- [Louise] I can't stay.

681
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:06,911
You'll have to take care of yourself.

682
01:06:06,911 --> 01:06:07,911
- Then wait.

683
01:06:22,114 --> 01:06:24,697
(Louise moans)

684
01:06:26,080 --> 01:06:28,250
- Are you waiting for me?

685
01:06:28,250 --> 01:06:30,693
- You know, Johnny wanna
buy you a drink, man.

686
01:06:31,650 --> 01:06:33,750
You handled yourself pretty good up there.

687
01:06:35,340 --> 01:06:38,163
You and the photographer have
a lot of good times, huh?

688
01:06:40,090 --> 01:06:41,303
- I wouldn't say that.

689
01:06:42,509 --> 01:06:44,725
I'm going for a walk on the beach tonight

690
01:06:44,725 --> 01:06:47,191
before I do anything.

691
01:06:47,191 --> 01:06:49,108
Would you like to come?

692
01:06:50,866 --> 01:06:54,699
(tinkling instrumental music)

693
01:07:14,914 --> 01:07:16,265
(whispering voices)

694
01:07:16,265 --> 01:07:17,175
- [Man Voiceover] That's what I do,

695
01:07:17,175 --> 01:07:18,900
that's what I like!
- What are you doing to me?

696
01:07:18,900 --> 01:07:20,156
Why didn't you tell me?

697
01:07:20,156 --> 01:07:23,323
- We used each other.
- No, no, no, no.

698
01:07:27,573 --> 01:07:30,225
I wanna douse you in paraffin.

699
01:07:30,225 --> 01:07:32,478
I'm gonna set you alight.

700
01:07:32,478 --> 01:07:34,395
Wish, wish, wish, wish.

701
01:07:35,662 --> 01:07:38,963
Goddamn you! (laughs)

702
01:07:38,963 --> 01:07:41,630
(Louise grunts)

703
01:08:12,017 --> 01:08:15,017
(people chattering)

704
01:08:16,077 --> 01:08:17,323
Hello, Johnny.

705
01:08:18,994 --> 01:08:20,887
- [Johnny] I didn't expect you so soon.

706
01:08:23,550 --> 01:08:26,643
- You invited me over
here, isn't that right?

707
01:08:26,643 --> 01:08:27,476
- Yeah.

708
01:08:29,940 --> 01:08:30,773
Sit down.

709
01:08:36,110 --> 01:08:38,923
I guess you thought I was
a little rough on Carlos.

710
01:08:41,470 --> 01:08:46,470
- No, I thought you handled
him just about right.

711
01:08:48,270 --> 01:08:51,113
- Then why the fucking
thing with the knife, huh?

712
01:08:52,218 --> 01:08:55,790
- Yes, it was just a little head release.

713
01:08:57,978 --> 01:09:00,811
Just trying to get your attention.

714
01:09:02,523 --> 01:09:04,445
- You like something to drink?

715
01:09:04,445 --> 01:09:07,213
Some tequila, rum?

716
01:09:14,290 --> 01:09:16,563
What would you like to drink?

717
01:09:18,340 --> 01:09:19,540
- Do you have any blood?

718
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:23,163
- Maybe some red wine.

719
01:09:26,720 --> 01:09:29,453
- Couldn't you slit your
wrist a little for me?

720
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:32,463
I'm so thirsty.

721
01:09:33,389 --> 01:09:36,222
(Johnny chuckles)

722
01:09:39,449 --> 01:09:41,866
- You better be careful, huh.

723
01:09:44,040 --> 01:09:46,223
This kinky talk really turns me on.

724
01:09:48,452 --> 01:09:49,693
- I don't wanna be careful.

725
01:09:51,570 --> 01:09:54,808
I wanna bleed your memory
of every experience

726
01:09:54,808 --> 01:09:59,808
that ever turned you on.

727
01:10:02,957 --> 01:10:07,957
- Show me what you can do.

728
01:10:08,543 --> 01:10:10,793
(laughing)

729
01:10:13,731 --> 01:10:16,457
(lights buzz)

730
01:10:16,457 --> 01:10:20,538
- So, Johnny, what's
the most exciting thing

731
01:10:20,538 --> 01:10:22,969
you've ever done?

732
01:10:22,969 --> 01:10:27,969
- When I was 14, I fucked
both my mother's sisters.

733
01:10:29,396 --> 01:10:31,313
- Mother's sister, huh?

734
01:10:33,657 --> 01:10:35,384
Are you sure that's
the most exciting thing

735
01:10:35,384 --> 01:10:36,290
you've ever done?

736
01:10:36,290 --> 01:10:37,623
- [Johnny] Yeah.

737
01:10:38,557 --> 01:10:39,807
- Are you sure?

738
01:10:42,093 --> 01:10:46,070
- [Johnny] She was the private
secretary for the general.

739
01:10:46,070 --> 01:10:50,303
Sex, something, it's the
government's secret weapon.

740
01:10:53,060 --> 01:10:55,390
You can train the private, though,

741
01:10:56,695 --> 01:11:00,557
to protect himself from a
girl's tricks and a man's.

742
01:11:00,557 --> 01:11:05,057
But no man is ever safe (indistinct).

743
01:11:06,812 --> 01:11:11,229
(grunting)
(buzzing)

744
01:11:14,577 --> 01:11:18,904
- [Louise] Weren't you
in jail for a while?

745
01:11:18,904 --> 01:11:20,726
Didn't something in jail happen

746
01:11:20,726 --> 01:11:22,643
that was more exciting?

747
01:11:23,927 --> 01:11:25,177
- What is this?

748
01:11:29,399 --> 01:11:34,399
- Didn't you and your gang
tie up a boy and rape him?

749
01:11:37,670 --> 01:11:40,480
Didn't you say then that was

750
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:43,597
the most exciting thing
that ever happened?

751
01:11:45,307 --> 01:11:46,233
Oh, Johnny.

752
01:11:50,030 --> 01:11:51,253
Where's that boy?

753
01:11:53,414 --> 01:11:55,997
Did he kill himself afterwards?

754
01:11:57,812 --> 01:11:59,396
- You're fucking sick.

755
01:11:59,396 --> 01:12:00,529
(Louise chuckles)

756
01:12:00,529 --> 01:12:02,279
Who fucking sent you?

757
01:12:03,584 --> 01:12:05,084
- No, you're sick.

758
01:12:06,380 --> 01:12:09,212
Johnny, can I ask you something?

759
01:12:09,212 --> 01:12:11,045
Do you know Fu Manchu?

760
01:12:18,407 --> 01:12:20,490
Come on, Johnny, come on!

761
01:12:24,457 --> 01:12:25,957
Go ahead, feed me!

762
01:12:26,925 --> 01:12:29,092
(panting)

763
01:12:39,328 --> 01:12:41,589
(grunting)

764
01:12:41,589 --> 01:12:44,339
(Johnny screams)

765
01:12:45,820 --> 01:12:48,403
(light buzzes)

766
01:13:09,580 --> 01:13:12,247
(wind whistles)

767
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:17,894
(water splatters)

768
01:13:17,894 --> 01:13:20,644
(machinery hums)

769
01:13:48,030 --> 01:13:49,323
- I wanna meet this girl.

770
01:13:50,970 --> 01:13:54,060
I'm sending the negatives
to the printer today,

771
01:13:54,060 --> 01:13:57,293
and then I'm giving thought
to a national campaign.

772
01:13:59,050 --> 01:14:04,050
This is a big break for you, Carlos, okay?

773
01:14:04,830 --> 01:14:06,973
But I have to meet the girl.

774
01:14:08,700 --> 01:14:11,140
- Look, man, it's out of my hands.

775
01:14:11,140 --> 01:14:13,440
She doesn't wanna meet with anybody.

776
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:16,340
- What, you think that I'm gonna invest

777
01:14:16,340 --> 01:14:19,163
in a major campaign if I
haven't even met the girl?

778
01:14:20,310 --> 01:14:24,323
I'm talking about a $10,000 fee.

779
01:14:25,565 --> 01:14:28,693
- [Ghostly Voice] Redeem your soul.

780
01:14:33,046 --> 01:14:34,129
Help us feed.

781
01:14:40,511 --> 01:14:41,771
Redeem.

782
01:14:41,771 --> 01:14:44,554
- Okay, look, man, I'm
working with her tonight.

783
01:14:44,554 --> 01:14:45,457
- Thank you.

784
01:14:45,457 --> 01:14:46,290
- I'll talk to her,

785
01:14:46,290 --> 01:14:47,707
but I don't know.

786
01:14:48,929 --> 01:14:52,010
- You don't know, you
prick son of a bitch?

787
01:14:52,010 --> 01:14:55,020
If you don't arrange a meeting for me,

788
01:14:55,020 --> 01:14:58,530
believe me, I will find a
way to go directly to her.

789
01:14:58,530 --> 01:14:59,363
Okay?

790
01:15:00,280 --> 01:15:04,147
Don't embarrass yourself, and
don't waste my goddamn time.

791
01:15:06,290 --> 01:15:09,573
Look, here, this is 1,000 bucks, okay?

792
01:15:15,100 --> 01:15:16,530
We're square.

793
01:15:16,530 --> 01:15:20,433
Now, if you ever wanna work for me again,

794
01:15:21,422 --> 01:15:24,530
you're gonna deliver the goods.

795
01:15:24,530 --> 01:15:25,363
You understand?

796
01:15:27,790 --> 01:15:28,623
Remember.

797
01:15:39,641 --> 01:15:42,558
(whispering voice)

798
01:15:46,256 --> 01:15:48,923
(engine whines)

799
01:15:53,108 --> 01:15:56,025
(whispering voice)

800
01:15:57,542 --> 01:15:59,489
(door creak)

801
01:15:59,489 --> 01:16:02,406
(whispering voice)

802
01:16:06,840 --> 01:16:07,673
- Hello?

803
01:16:09,320 --> 01:16:10,320
How are you feeling?

804
01:16:16,990 --> 01:16:19,640
I thought you'd be a bit
too bruised to work tonight.

805
01:16:25,090 --> 01:16:27,893
- My cousin Johnny was
murdered last night.

806
01:16:28,923 --> 01:16:31,453
It's okay, you don't have to say anything.

807
01:16:34,100 --> 01:16:35,223
You want a drink?

808
01:16:37,480 --> 01:16:38,373
- No, thanks.

809
01:16:42,514 --> 01:16:45,793
Carlos, would you read me a poem?

810
01:16:49,517 --> 01:16:51,163
- [Carlos] You came by to sink your talons

811
01:16:51,163 --> 01:16:52,720
in a little deeper, huh?

812
01:16:54,230 --> 01:16:57,943
- Please, you're getting way off track.

813
01:16:59,866 --> 01:17:01,190
- I'm not even touching you.

814
01:17:01,190 --> 01:17:02,983
Why are you so defensive, huh?

815
01:17:04,516 --> 01:17:06,216
- That's not what I want from you.

816
01:17:11,999 --> 01:17:15,848
- Well, at the risk of
losing my only model.

817
01:17:15,848 --> 01:17:18,765
(whispering voice)

818
01:17:22,180 --> 01:17:25,435
(Louise gasps)

819
01:17:25,435 --> 01:17:26,852
You are so weird.

820
01:17:28,922 --> 01:17:30,497
I'm going to show you something.

821
01:17:38,522 --> 01:17:39,939
It's my first portrait.

822
01:17:39,939 --> 01:17:42,856
(whispering voice)

823
01:17:44,479 --> 01:17:45,390
- [Louise Voiceover] Touching my breasts,

824
01:17:45,390 --> 01:17:47,024
his warm hands touching my breasts.

825
01:17:47,024 --> 01:17:49,941
(whispering voice)

826
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:54,180
Stupid, so stupid believing this shit.

827
01:17:54,180 --> 01:17:55,813
Falling for this shit.

828
01:17:55,813 --> 01:17:58,800
(whispering voice)

829
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:00,050
- You think you can seduce me

830
01:18:00,050 --> 01:18:02,033
with your little romantic tricks?

831
01:18:08,450 --> 01:18:10,200
- Is there no end to your attitude?

832
01:18:12,750 --> 01:18:14,003
It's very simple with me.

833
01:18:16,360 --> 01:18:18,893
My thoughts are not as
strong as my feelings.

834
01:18:20,540 --> 01:18:25,540
My words are not as true as my touch.

835
01:18:28,891 --> 01:18:30,460
- You're making this up.

836
01:18:30,460 --> 01:18:31,773
At least be honest.

837
01:18:33,800 --> 01:18:35,700
I might have more respect for you then.

838
01:18:36,885 --> 01:18:38,435
- I'm being as honest as I can.

839
01:18:40,277 --> 01:18:44,177
If you don't believe me,
can you read my mind?

840
01:18:46,435 --> 01:18:47,268
- No.

841
01:18:47,268 --> 01:18:49,260
- Tell me, can you read my mind?

842
01:18:49,260 --> 01:18:50,517
Am I lying to you?

843
01:18:51,401 --> 01:18:53,318
- No, no, I don't know.

844
01:18:54,380 --> 01:18:55,610
Sit down.

845
01:19:01,597 --> 01:19:05,097
(soft instrumental music)

846
01:20:39,964 --> 01:20:42,131
- [Ghostly Voice] Feed us.

847
01:20:43,835 --> 01:20:46,168
- [Louise] No, stop, please.

848
01:21:09,591 --> 01:21:12,508
(whispering voice)

849
01:21:14,622 --> 01:21:18,039
(low instrumental music)

850
01:21:22,615 --> 01:21:25,760
- [Carlos] Where are you going?

851
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:28,593
- [Louise] Get some sleep, Carlos.

852
01:21:30,612 --> 01:21:31,493
- [Carlos] What's the matter?

853
01:21:33,558 --> 01:21:34,391
Louise!

854
01:21:38,090 --> 01:21:42,347
(tinkling instrumental music)

855
01:21:42,347 --> 01:21:45,306
(screaming)

856
01:21:45,306 --> 01:21:48,556
(tinkling piano music)

857
01:21:59,986 --> 01:22:02,113
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

858
01:22:02,113 --> 01:22:02,946
Hey!

859
01:22:03,974 --> 01:22:05,589
I just want, I need to talk to you.

860
01:22:05,589 --> 01:22:08,561
(tinkling piano music)

861
01:22:08,561 --> 01:22:09,394
Hello?

862
01:22:10,251 --> 01:22:13,501
(tinkling piano music)

863
01:22:23,403 --> 01:22:24,570
Hey, hey, hey!

864
01:22:25,472 --> 01:22:27,192
Wait a minute, will you, please?

865
01:22:27,192 --> 01:22:30,442
(tinkling piano music)

866
01:22:39,383 --> 01:22:41,853
- Hey, man, did you see a girl?

867
01:22:41,853 --> 01:22:44,580
- Sure, I've seen her many a time.

868
01:22:44,580 --> 01:22:47,470
Often wish she could be mine.

869
01:22:47,470 --> 01:22:48,420
- Hey what is this?

870
01:22:49,770 --> 01:22:53,630
- Take the key and you will find

871
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:58,120
that it will save your sweet behind.

872
01:22:58,120 --> 01:23:00,240
- Come on, man, did you
see the girl or not?

873
01:23:00,240 --> 01:23:02,150
- I said I'd seen them.

874
01:23:02,150 --> 01:23:03,603
You heard me well.

875
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:08,091
Impatience will take
you on the road to hell.

876
01:23:08,091 --> 01:23:10,210
- What did you say, you seen
them? She was with somebody?

877
01:23:11,260 --> 01:23:15,113
- Give way to jealousy and you're doomed.

878
01:23:16,170 --> 01:23:18,543
On an island of fear, you'll be marooned.

879
01:23:19,450 --> 01:23:22,500
Take the turning that I have picked.

880
01:23:22,500 --> 01:23:25,183
You'll find her in the hotel.

881
01:23:26,090 --> 01:23:27,053
It's derelict.

882
01:23:30,396 --> 01:23:35,396
(shouting voice)
(whispering voice)

883
01:23:45,595 --> 01:23:47,179
- [Louise Voiceover] Stupid, so stupid.

884
01:23:47,179 --> 01:23:51,030
- What kind of fucking nightmare is this?

885
01:23:51,030 --> 01:23:54,198
Look, if I scared you out there,

886
01:23:54,198 --> 01:23:56,615
believe me, I didn't mean to.

887
01:23:58,173 --> 01:23:59,439
You're just so goddamned beautiful,

888
01:23:59,439 --> 01:24:00,844
I had to meet you.

889
01:24:00,844 --> 01:24:02,868
Where are you, anyway?

890
01:24:02,868 --> 01:24:04,302
Louise, right?

891
01:24:04,302 --> 01:24:05,887
I'm Bud from Amazon Lingerie.

892
01:24:05,887 --> 01:24:07,767
I am Amazon Lingerie.

893
01:24:07,767 --> 01:24:09,373
The last thing on earth I want

894
01:24:09,373 --> 01:24:11,993
is for you to be shy with me.

895
01:24:11,993 --> 01:24:13,211
- [Louise Voiceover] Stupid, so stupid.

896
01:24:13,211 --> 01:24:15,709
- Who else is in here?

897
01:24:15,709 --> 01:24:18,542
(Louise whimpers)

898
01:24:21,121 --> 01:24:22,547
Is that you?

899
01:24:22,547 --> 01:24:23,648
(Louise whimpers)

900
01:24:23,648 --> 01:24:26,290
Oh, I don't even wanna think about

901
01:24:26,290 --> 01:24:29,592
a pretty little thing like you crying.

902
01:24:29,592 --> 01:24:30,573
Maybe I can help you.

903
01:24:31,542 --> 01:24:32,375
Stop crying now.

904
01:24:33,287 --> 01:24:36,120
(Louise whimpers)

905
01:24:39,626 --> 01:24:44,626
- I look such a mess. (cries)

906
01:24:47,694 --> 01:24:50,354
- You could never look a
mess, you're so beautiful.

907
01:24:50,354 --> 01:24:51,604
- Oh, but I do!

908
01:24:54,571 --> 01:24:59,571
And I know you like pretty girls. (cries)

909
01:25:01,998 --> 01:25:06,165
- Hey, I promise, I don't
care what you look like.

910
01:25:08,123 --> 01:25:08,956
I don't.

911
01:25:10,261 --> 01:25:12,613
- You really don't care what I look like?

912
01:25:12,613 --> 01:25:13,613
- I promise.

913
01:25:14,878 --> 01:25:16,563
(dramatic instrumental music)

914
01:25:16,563 --> 01:25:18,326
(Louise laughs)

915
01:25:18,326 --> 01:25:19,575
- What's up, Bud?

916
01:25:19,575 --> 01:25:21,052
Remind you of someone?

917
01:25:21,052 --> 01:25:22,385
Maybe your soul!

918
01:25:23,879 --> 01:25:27,089
(Bud screams)
- We used each other.

919
01:25:27,089 --> 01:25:28,997
(screaming)

920
01:25:28,997 --> 01:25:30,580
We used each other.

921
01:25:43,783 --> 01:25:47,200
(bluesy harmonica music)

922
01:26:04,317 --> 01:26:05,567
(bottle shatters)

923
01:26:05,567 --> 01:26:08,984
(bluesy harmonica music)

924
01:26:19,670 --> 01:26:21,313
- Amazon Lingerie, please.

925
01:26:23,730 --> 01:26:26,973
Hi, this is Carlos, can I speak to Bud?

926
01:26:29,380 --> 01:26:31,370
Is he expected back?

927
01:26:31,370 --> 01:26:33,450
No, that's fine.

928
01:26:33,450 --> 01:26:35,120
No, no, no message.

929
01:26:35,120 --> 01:26:36,437
Okay, thank you, bye bye.

930
01:26:45,970 --> 01:26:47,993
Flagler Trust, please.

931
01:26:51,130 --> 01:26:53,783
- I'm fed up, I'm changing banks, sorry.

932
01:26:54,690 --> 01:26:56,140
- You have a lovely day, too.

933
01:26:57,650 --> 01:26:58,523
Next, please.

934
01:27:02,520 --> 01:27:03,457
Can I help you?

935
01:27:04,790 --> 01:27:07,623
- [Carlos] Yes, I want to
open my safety deposit box.

936
01:27:09,660 --> 01:27:10,660
- That's an old key.

937
01:27:13,200 --> 01:27:14,223
- Yeah, it is.

938
01:27:15,230 --> 01:27:16,193
- That way, please.

939
01:27:27,230 --> 01:27:30,060
- My family, they've lived
in Miami for a long time.

940
01:28:13,422 --> 01:28:14,742
- [Man Voiceover] We used each other.

941
01:28:14,742 --> 01:28:18,359
(shouting voices)

942
01:28:18,359 --> 01:28:20,305
We used each other.
- No, no, no, no.

943
01:28:20,305 --> 01:28:22,687
(shouting voices)

944
01:28:22,687 --> 01:28:24,095
(lightning cracks)
(shouting voices)

945
01:28:24,095 --> 01:28:25,659
- We used each other.
- No, no, no, no.

946
01:28:25,659 --> 01:28:28,745
(shouting voices)

947
01:28:28,745 --> 01:28:30,935
- We used each other.
- No, no, no, no.

948
01:28:30,935 --> 01:28:33,815
(shouting voices)

949
01:28:33,815 --> 01:28:35,514
- We used each other.
- No, no, no, no.

950
01:28:35,514 --> 01:28:38,742
(shouting voices)

951
01:28:38,742 --> 01:28:40,638
- We used each other.
- No, no, no, no.

952
01:28:40,638 --> 01:28:44,098
(shouting voices)

953
01:28:44,098 --> 01:28:47,265
- We used each other.
- No, no, no, no.

954
01:28:50,195 --> 01:28:52,195
- [Carlos] Are you here?

955
01:28:53,675 --> 01:28:55,565
Is there anybody here?

956
01:28:55,565 --> 01:29:00,565
(whispering voices)
(eerie instrumental music)

957
01:29:19,121 --> 01:29:20,539
- [Louise Voiceover] Stupid, so stupid

958
01:29:20,539 --> 01:29:22,190
for believing that shit.

959
01:29:22,190 --> 01:29:27,190
(whispering voice)
(eerie instrumental music)

960
01:29:29,180 --> 01:29:30,530
- Louise, are you in there?

961
01:29:31,460 --> 01:29:33,543
Louise, you maniac, answer me.

962
01:29:34,616 --> 01:29:39,616
(whispering voice)
(eerie instrumental music)

963
01:29:48,186 --> 01:29:50,686
(door creaks)

964
01:29:53,484 --> 01:29:54,567
Jesus Christ.

965
01:29:57,831 --> 01:29:59,998
- You shouldn't have come!

966
01:30:11,397 --> 01:30:13,980
(Louise roars)

967
01:30:17,234 --> 01:30:18,801
We made a deal!

968
01:30:18,801 --> 01:30:21,468
(Louise shouts)

969
01:30:25,168 --> 01:30:26,997
- You're crazy.

970
01:30:26,997 --> 01:30:28,747
What happened to Bud?

971
01:30:31,258 --> 01:30:35,270
- Bud. (gags)

972
01:30:35,270 --> 01:30:38,307
Hey, hey, wait a minute.

973
01:30:40,410 --> 01:30:43,033
You think I really want to kill you?

974
01:30:44,620 --> 01:30:46,008
- Louise, I wanted to help you.

975
01:30:46,008 --> 01:30:47,675
- You can't help me!

976
01:30:48,825 --> 01:30:50,769
(Louise groans)

977
01:30:50,769 --> 01:30:53,269
- So you need the deed, right?

978
01:30:54,345 --> 01:30:56,095
- What have you done?

979
01:30:57,470 --> 01:30:58,593
- I found your key.

980
01:31:00,240 --> 01:31:02,100
So tell me, what does it mean?

981
01:31:02,100 --> 01:31:04,447
The building gets sold, it gets restored?

982
01:31:04,447 --> 01:31:05,980
- Something like that.

983
01:31:05,980 --> 01:31:08,183
- Tell me why you came to me.

984
01:31:11,378 --> 01:31:12,211
- Maybe

985
01:31:14,633 --> 01:31:16,940
because we need to be saved.

986
01:31:16,940 --> 01:31:17,853
- Me or you?

987
01:31:19,420 --> 01:31:20,373
- Both of us!

988
01:31:21,500 --> 01:31:23,150
- [Carlos] I need to be with you.

989
01:31:25,270 --> 01:31:27,243
(Louise gags)

990
01:31:27,243 --> 01:31:29,160
- You can't be with me!

991
01:31:30,290 --> 01:31:32,067
- Look, I don't care what you are!

992
01:31:34,846 --> 01:31:36,139
I love you.

993
01:31:36,139 --> 01:31:39,304
- I don't believe in love anymore!

994
01:31:39,304 --> 01:31:41,971
(Louise groans)

995
01:31:42,947 --> 01:31:44,697
Don't you understand?

996
01:31:46,073 --> 01:31:48,323
(rumbling)

997
01:31:54,097 --> 01:31:54,930
Go away!

998
01:31:57,134 --> 01:31:58,051
Okay, okay.

999
01:32:03,692 --> 01:32:04,525
Carlos,

1000
01:32:06,033 --> 01:32:09,366
there's only one way you can be with me.

1001
01:32:10,335 --> 01:32:15,335
But you have to do something
you've never done before.

1002
01:32:15,484 --> 01:32:18,491
- [Carlos] Yeah, and what is that?

1003
01:32:18,491 --> 01:32:19,991
- Commit yourself.

1004
01:32:23,261 --> 01:32:25,208
- I can do that.

1005
01:32:25,208 --> 01:32:26,735
- Forever?

1006
01:32:26,735 --> 01:32:28,815
I don't think so.

1007
01:32:28,815 --> 01:32:30,232
- [Carlos] I can.

1008
01:32:34,275 --> 01:32:35,525
- Maybe you can

1009
01:32:44,244 --> 01:32:46,744
be with a woman that's killed?

1010
01:33:05,649 --> 01:33:07,982
- I don't care what you are.

1011
01:33:14,618 --> 01:33:17,868
- You might not survive the initiation.

1012
01:33:20,877 --> 01:33:21,710
- Try me.

1013
01:33:23,864 --> 01:33:25,031
- You said it.

1014
01:33:31,253 --> 01:33:33,086
- [Ghostly] Redeem us.

1015
01:33:36,176 --> 01:33:40,583
(eerie instrumental music)

1016
01:33:40,583 --> 01:33:43,083
(sign buzzes)

1017
01:33:49,183 --> 01:33:51,433
(rumbling)

1018
01:34:01,817 --> 01:34:05,400
(eerie instrumental music)

1019
01:35:18,459 --> 01:35:22,292
(singing in foreign language)

1020
01:35:48,631 --> 01:35:50,631
- Carlos, Senora Louise.

1021
01:35:51,674 --> 01:35:53,424
Pleasure to meet you.

1022
01:35:54,935 --> 01:35:58,484
Even more beautiful than you described.

1023
01:35:58,484 --> 01:35:59,484
- Thank you.

1024
01:36:01,537 --> 01:36:02,788
- [Man] Shall you girls join us?

1025
01:36:02,788 --> 01:36:05,955
- Maybe later, I'm too busy right now.

1026
01:36:09,230 --> 01:36:10,453
- [Man] I love this place.

1027
01:36:12,777 --> 01:36:13,877
- Take a look at this.

1028
01:36:18,740 --> 01:36:20,670
- Where did you get this?

1029
01:36:20,670 --> 01:36:21,503
- It's mine.

1030
01:36:22,940 --> 01:36:26,253
My grandmother left it to me in her will.

1031
01:36:27,840 --> 01:36:30,823
- Her grandmother was a
famous model who disappeared.

1032
01:36:33,340 --> 01:36:35,482
- [Man] Do you want to sell it?

1033
01:36:35,482 --> 01:36:37,010
- But of course.

1034
01:36:37,010 --> 01:36:38,910
She would like to have it restored

1035
01:36:38,910 --> 01:36:41,783
and full of people as soon as possible.

1036
01:36:43,291 --> 01:36:44,124
Don't you?

1037
01:36:51,466 --> 01:36:52,299
- Do you?

1038
01:37:00,660 --> 01:37:03,243
- Yes, my soul depends upon it.

1039
01:37:09,665 --> 01:37:13,165
(soft instrumental music)

1040
01:37:18,034 --> 01:37:21,117
(lively piano music)
