1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:04,379
(lion roaring)

2
00:00:09,593 --> 00:00:13,055
(light orchestral music)

3
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:27,254
(plane engine roaring)

4
00:01:33,677 --> 00:01:37,681
(fast-paced acoustic guitar music)

5
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:51,778
(elevator dinging)

6
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:48,543
(airplane engine roaring)

7
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:53,674
- Can you go through with it?

8
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:03,599
Can you?

9
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:06,769
(sighing)

10
00:03:06,812 --> 00:03:08,146
- I love you, Daniel.

11
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:09,815
- Is that an answer?

12
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:17,781
- When I was little, my mother
always made me make promises.

13
00:03:18,073 --> 00:03:19,282
Like tidy up the bed.

14
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:21,451
(sighing)

15
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:24,204
Promises I couldn't keep.

16
00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:26,016
I always felt so guilty when I failed.

17
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:26,748
(laughing) Ah!

18
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,584
So, now I don't promise things.

19
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:35,298
(gasps)

20
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,050
- Christ, Marie, I love you.

21
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:38,342
- Ah, yes.

22
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:44,766
(airplane engine roaring)

23
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:47,184
- When?

24
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:51,481
When are you gonna tell Alex?

25
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:52,274
(sighs)

26
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:53,066
- In Mexico.

27
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:54,985
After a speech at the conference.

28
00:03:55,277 --> 00:03:56,945
Where are my underwear?

29
00:04:00,866 --> 00:04:01,533
(laughing)

30
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:03,243
Come here, Daniel.

31
00:04:05,454 --> 00:04:06,454
Oh.

32
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:09,332
It ought to be so easy.

33
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:11,835
Shit.

34
00:04:12,127 --> 00:04:12,627
Is that the time?

35
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:13,919
It's 4:30.

36
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:14,962
I've got to go.

37
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:19,301
I'm leaving for Acapulco in the morning.

38
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,645
- [Daniel] Marie, wait.

39
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:34,107
Are you all right?

40
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:34,900
- Yeah.

41
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:36,193
I am.

42
00:04:36,485 --> 00:04:37,485
I'm happy.

43
00:04:43,325 --> 00:04:46,620
(airplane engine roaring)

44
00:04:52,584 --> 00:04:53,752
What're you doing?

45
00:04:54,044 --> 00:04:55,044
Get in there.

46
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:57,713
Go on.

47
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:19,778
- [Girl] Mommy, I can't find my left shoe.

48
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:22,447
(phone ringing)

49
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:25,534
- Hello?

50
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:26,826
Hi.

51
00:05:27,953 --> 00:05:30,789
(chuckles)

52
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:34,042
(upbeat Mariachi music)

53
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,713
(speaking foreign language)

54
00:05:58,984 --> 00:05:59,693
- You wanted to talk to me about something.

55
00:05:59,985 --> 00:06:00,985
What was it?

56
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:06,449
- Can we stop pedaling this thing?

57
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:09,828
- You should exercise more, Marie.

58
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,038
We used to play tennis all the time.

59
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:15,333
How come we don't play tennis anymore?

60
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:21,047
If you could see the clogged,
decayed arteries that I see,

61
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:23,425
even at 35 years old, you'd take exercise

62
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:25,510
a little more seriously.

63
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:33,434
What?

64
00:06:36,855 --> 00:06:40,942
- I was just thinking about
you and me playing tennis.

65
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:42,485
We used to laugh a lot.

66
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:43,777
-Hmm.

67
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:44,945
Yeah.

68
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:46,197
Laughing is good.

69
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:49,701
(both chuckling)

70
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:50,993
Pedal.

71
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,371
- I don't want to.

72
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:54,164
- I gotta take a leak.

73
00:06:54,456 --> 00:06:55,081
I'm going in.

74
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:56,082
- Just do it over the side.

75
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:58,460
No one will look.
- No, I wanna go in anyway.

76
00:06:58,752 --> 00:06:59,252
- Shit.

77
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:00,544
I'm sorry.

78
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:01,880
It's my bad hand.

79
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:06,092
- [Alex] Marie, I wish
you'd let Bobby fix that.

80
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:07,844
- [Marie] Bobby's a plastic surgeon.

81
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:09,136
- [Alex] Yes, he is.

82
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,220
The best.

83
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:13,016
- Anyway, I quite like it.

84
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:26,071
(dreamy orchestral music)

85
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:01,982
(speaking foreign language)

86
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:27,924
Alex!

87
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:29,509
Alex, Alex, come here.

88
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:30,301
Move!

89
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:31,302
Alex.

90
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:32,594
Alex!

91
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:38,518
(boat thudding)

92
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:12,052
Help me!

93
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:13,343
Help me!

94
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:33,531
(grunting)

95
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:40,080
(people chattering)

96
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:04,145
(speaking foreign language)

97
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:15,072
Oh!

98
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,240
Oh, hurry!

99
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:20,036
(speaking foreign language)

100
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:40,849
(dramatic orchestral music)

101
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:43,518
(all clamoring)

102
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:49,983
(speaking foreign language)

103
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,409
(crying)

104
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:24,684
(siren wailing)

105
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:44,537
(bells tolling)

106
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:52,837
(siren wailing)

107
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:07,310
(speaking foreign language)

108
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:13,982
What?

109
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:17,111
Where are they taking him?

110
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:21,074
(speaking foreign language)

111
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:21,991
I don't understand.

112
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:23,283
Do you speak English?

113
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:23,952
- Al little.

114
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:24,744
Please.

115
00:12:25,036 --> 00:12:26,120
Thank you.

116
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:27,412
He is your husband, yes?

117
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:28,039
- Yes, yes.

118
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:29,331
He's my husband.

119
00:12:29,374 --> 00:12:29,874
- We will look after him now.

120
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,326
Then the doctor, he will come

121
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:33,002
and he will speak to you soon.

122
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:34,294
I must have some details.

123
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:36,464
Your name, a little about
your husband, please.

124
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,174
- Um, Davenport.

125
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:41,010
D-A-V-E-N-P-O-R-T.

126
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:42,387
- First name?

127
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:43,679
- Marie.

128
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:47,225
- And your husband?

129
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:48,017
(sighing)

130
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:49,309
- Alex.

131
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:50,812
Dr. Alex Davenport.

132
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:52,104
- Doctor.

133
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,023
His age?

134
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:55,315
- 39.

135
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:02,156
(dramatic orchestral music)

136
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:10,248
I should've told him before I came.

137
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,333
Why did I come?

138
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:13,865
This never would have happened.

139
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:15,211
What if he's brain-damaged?

140
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:16,963
God, how long will he be ill?

141
00:13:17,255 --> 00:13:18,482
I should've told him before we came.

142
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:19,882
Why did I come?

143
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:21,454
Why didn't I tell him yesterday?

144
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:22,509
I feel so odd.

145
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:24,262
Where are the passports and credit cards?

146
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:25,972
Did I leave them at the hotel,

147
00:13:26,264 --> 00:13:27,408
or did I leave them in that bag

148
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:29,142
on that stupid fucking pedal boat?

149
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:30,434
I'd be on the plane.

150
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,662
Nothing would have happened.

151
00:13:31,686 --> 00:13:32,686
It might not be too bad.

152
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:34,289
Things always look worse than they are.

153
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:35,749
I should've told him at breakfast.

154
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:36,357
What if he's brain-damaged?

155
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:37,649
Why didn't I tell him?

156
00:13:37,692 --> 00:13:38,192
Why?

157
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:39,712
These people looked better when they came.

158
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:42,030
I feel so hot and weird.

159
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:42,905
The passports.

160
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:44,574
Please, don't let him die.

161
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:48,244
(speaking foreign language)

162
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:54,042
Oh, excuse me.

163
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:56,254
Could you tell me what
date it is today, please?

164
00:13:56,419 --> 00:13:57,962
- Date?

165
00:13:58,254 --> 00:13:59,339
August 15th.

166
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:00,089
(sighs)

167
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:01,981
- We were in Carmel this time last year.

168
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:04,302
August 15, August 15, August 15.

169
00:14:04,594 --> 00:14:05,928
Last year this time.

170
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:06,721
Last year.

171
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:08,264
Carmel.

172
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:09,932
Haunting me.

173
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:11,224
- [Eerie Voice] Marie.

174
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:13,078
- [Marie Voiceover]
It's just like some test.

175
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:14,102
I don't believe it.

176
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:15,063
It makes no sense.

177
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:16,355
It's not my fault.

178
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:17,023
The reason.

179
00:14:17,315 --> 00:14:20,276
Everything, every thought I've ever had.

180
00:14:21,444 --> 00:14:25,198
Oh, Christ, my imagination, my memory.

181
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:26,490
I can't.

182
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:28,910
I must separate them.

183
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:30,202
It's my imagination.

184
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:31,621
It's my imagination.

185
00:14:31,913 --> 00:14:34,374
My heart went wild with memories.

186
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:35,705
Every thought of that day.

187
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,794
- [Man] Senora Davenport.

188
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:44,258
(speaking foreign language)

189
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:54,227
(knocking on door)

190
00:14:57,355 --> 00:15:00,358
- Senora Davenport, please come in.

191
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:13,847
- [Marie Voiceover] Is
this what it feels like?

192
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:15,123
- I regret, Senora...

193
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:18,292
- With a worry about right and wrong.

194
00:15:19,502 --> 00:15:20,502
What to do.

195
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:21,711
Oh.

196
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,066
- [Man] I'm afraid there
was little that we could do.

197
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,401
- [Marie Voiceover] On my own now.

198
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:26,568
- [Man] He suffered a very
severe blow to the head.

199
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:27,832
- [Marie Voiceover] I'm single.

200
00:15:27,969 --> 00:15:29,446
- [Man] The fracture itself was small.

201
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:29,971
- [Marie Voiceover] On
my own now, I'm a widow.

202
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:31,663
- [Man] But the brain injury was...

203
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,599
- [Marie Voiceover] What an old word.

204
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:34,559
- Severe.

205
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:37,228
- [Marie Voiceover] Daniel.

206
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,397
- He was a doctor, no?

207
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:40,815
- I got what I wanted.

208
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:41,732
Yes.

209
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:43,024
Did I?

210
00:15:44,402 --> 00:15:46,070
He's a pathologist.

211
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:49,073
I don't understand how I feel.

212
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:52,118
- [Man] I'm very sorry, ma'am.

213
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:53,077
- We were-

214
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:54,555
- At the international conference.

215
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:55,579
I know.

216
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:59,333
I listened to your husband's
paper on atherosclerosis.

217
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,385
Now, we will contact
the American consulate.

218
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:02,521
- [Marie Voiceover] What do I feel?

219
00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:03,564
- [Man] To help you with the arrangements.

220
00:16:03,588 --> 00:16:04,988
- [Marie Voiceover] What do I want?

221
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:07,258
- I regret, Senora, but in these cases

222
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:10,261
we have to perform an autopsy.

223
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:11,804
Would you like to see the body?

224
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:13,615
- [Marie Voiceover] I've
never known anyone...

225
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:14,658
- [Man] They're moving him now.

226
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:18,811
- [Marie Voiceover] That
I fucked, or kissed, dead.

227
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:37,246
(gasps)

228
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:44,879
(dramatic orchestral music)

229
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:06,817
- I'm sorry, ma'am.

230
00:17:24,627 --> 00:17:25,253
- [Man] Senora.

231
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:26,545
- Thanks.

232
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:29,548
Thank you.

233
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:45,940
(dramatic orchestral music)

234
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:01,581
That blood on me was in him.

235
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:06,961
He's on my body.

236
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:10,840
I can feel him.

237
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:14,385
I can feel myself alive.

238
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:19,639
Dead blood.

239
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:21,891
Dead body.

240
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:27,857
I'm closer to him now than before.

241
00:18:28,149 --> 00:18:29,149
So secret.

242
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:33,779
I'll never feel him again.

243
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:37,408
I'll never feel him again.

244
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:39,492
Never.

245
00:18:43,414 --> 00:18:45,666
(exclaims)

246
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:57,053
(dramatic orchestral music)

247
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:13,903
(sighs)

248
00:19:14,195 --> 00:19:16,405
(sniffling)

249
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:03,744
(sighing)

250
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:16,549
(speaking foreign language)

251
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,596
- I don't understand,

252
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:24,199
the medical director wants to see me?

253
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:27,101
I thought Dr. DeMencos was
the one who was in charge.

254
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:31,147
- No, this is the head of the hospital.

255
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:31,939
- Why?

256
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,650
Does that mean the
autopsy's finished already?

257
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:36,182
- I don't know, Mrs. Davenport.

258
00:20:36,444 --> 00:20:38,738
The hospital called
the consul this morning.

259
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:40,531
Said that they had a problem,

260
00:20:40,823 --> 00:20:42,241
asked if I could bring you over.

261
00:20:42,533 --> 00:20:43,576
That's what I'm doing.

262
00:20:43,868 --> 00:20:44,868
Excuse me.

263
00:20:48,456 --> 00:20:51,959
(speaking foreign language)

264
00:21:00,134 --> 00:21:02,261
Director, Mrs. Davenport.

265
00:21:02,553 --> 00:21:03,553
- Senora.

266
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:05,598
- Have you told this
lady what has happened?

267
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:06,890
- No.

268
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:09,477
I thought you should do that.

269
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:13,147
(speaking foreign language)

270
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:22,364
- Senora, I must tell you

271
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:25,743
that your husband's body has disappeared.

272
00:21:27,495 --> 00:21:28,120
(sighing)

273
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:29,412
- What?

274
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:34,335
- That autopsy had been scheduled

275
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:35,961
for eight o'clock this morning.

276
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:38,923
At six minutes before eight,

277
00:21:39,215 --> 00:21:41,258
the pathologist on duty
found the plastic wrap

278
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,636
from your husband's body

279
00:21:43,928 --> 00:21:47,932
on the floor of the morgue
and the corpse missing.

280
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:50,285
A full search of the hospital

281
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:53,771
and all the facilities
has been carried out.

282
00:21:54,063 --> 00:21:55,523
No trace of the body.

283
00:21:58,943 --> 00:22:02,363
- The only remaining possibility is that

284
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:03,781
some lunatic,

285
00:22:04,073 --> 00:22:07,660
perhaps someone who was
known to you or your husband,

286
00:22:07,952 --> 00:22:09,578
has stolen the body.

287
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:12,790
- No, no, no.

288
00:22:15,209 --> 00:22:17,127
- Someone who hated him?

289
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:19,838
- It was an accident.

290
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:22,132
He was killed in an accident.

291
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:26,470
We don't know anyone in Mexico!

292
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:31,267
It just doesn't make any sense.

293
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:32,559
- No.

294
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:39,024
- Maybe he wasn't dead.

295
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:43,904
- There is no question of that, senora.

296
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:45,948
I examined him myself.

297
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,702
The tests for brain death were made.

298
00:22:49,994 --> 00:22:53,539
(speaking foreign language)

299
00:22:53,831 --> 00:22:55,499
- He was dead.

300
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:59,169
(speaking foreign language)

301
00:23:00,588 --> 00:23:02,339
Shortly after seven last night,

302
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:04,216
I saw the body myself.

303
00:23:05,134 --> 00:23:06,343
(speaking foreign language)

304
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:07,845
Madam, I know.

305
00:23:08,137 --> 00:23:11,515
(speaking foreign language)

306
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:16,645
Anyone who has seen
dead persons as often as

307
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:19,106
Dr. DeMencos and myself knows.

308
00:23:20,858 --> 00:23:24,361
(speaking foreign language)

309
00:23:27,281 --> 00:23:31,744
Today I studied the
preliminary pathology statement.

310
00:23:32,036 --> 00:23:36,123
(speaking foreign language)

311
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:38,709
There's no question of error.

312
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:44,882
- There was no misdiagnosis,

313
00:23:45,174 --> 00:23:49,887
even if there had been one,
by some unimaginable freak,

314
00:23:50,179 --> 00:23:52,539
your husband, a doctor himself,
would he not have contacted

315
00:23:52,765 --> 00:23:57,353
a hospital doctor or nurse about
such an astounding mistake?

316
00:23:57,645 --> 00:23:59,939
Would he not contact you?

317
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:04,026
(light acoustic guitar music)

318
00:24:04,318 --> 00:24:07,863
- I regret the police will
have to talk with you.

319
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:10,491
This whole affair has been most regretful.

320
00:24:10,783 --> 00:24:14,912
It is unparalleled in the
history of this hospital.

321
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:52,241
(sighs)

322
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:01,000
(sighs)

323
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:14,888
- What's so humiliating,

324
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:23,147
I didn't even see it slipping away.

325
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:27,985
(phone ringing)

326
00:25:29,111 --> 00:25:31,030
(sighs)

327
00:25:34,867 --> 00:25:36,994
(sighing)

328
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,793
You called from work.

329
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:47,004
You were here weekends.

330
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:55,763
I don't know even where
you found time for another...

331
00:25:56,055 --> 00:25:58,849
(phone ringing)

332
00:25:59,141 --> 00:26:01,101
(sighs)

333
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:10,486
(dramatic orchestral music)

334
00:26:49,108 --> 00:26:51,026
(gasps)

335
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:56,907
(suspenseful orchestral music)

336
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:04,039
(gasping)

337
00:27:13,257 --> 00:27:14,257
What is this, a plot?

338
00:27:14,424 --> 00:27:15,968
What, a conspiracy?

339
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:17,970
What, did she tell you what to say to me?

340
00:27:18,262 --> 00:27:20,281
In case you forgot your lines
and didn't know what to say?

341
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:20,806
Huh?

342
00:27:21,098 --> 00:27:21,598
Huh?

343
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:22,890
Answer me!

344
00:27:25,227 --> 00:27:26,227
- I'm sorry.

345
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:37,739
Listen, this doesn't change
the way I feel about you, Anna.

346
00:27:39,158 --> 00:27:40,909
I wish it did.

347
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:42,744
It'd be a lot easier.

348
00:27:43,036 --> 00:27:44,371
(grunts)

349
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:45,164
Stop it.

350
00:27:45,455 --> 00:27:45,956
Stop it!

351
00:27:46,248 --> 00:27:47,248
Stop it!

352
00:27:48,876 --> 00:27:51,295
(speaking foreign language)

353
00:27:51,587 --> 00:27:53,589
(panting)

354
00:28:11,857 --> 00:28:13,775
I've taken an apartment.

355
00:28:16,862 --> 00:28:17,863
Here's the number.

356
00:28:18,155 --> 00:28:19,990
If you need anything, call me.

357
00:28:20,282 --> 00:28:21,282
- Kiss me, Daniel.

358
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:23,702
- Listen, please, Anna, please.

359
00:28:43,347 --> 00:28:44,347
- Daniel,

360
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:48,352
I'll still be here.

361
00:28:51,188 --> 00:28:53,857
No, it doesn't change, does it?

362
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:06,328
(all chattering)

363
00:29:12,042 --> 00:29:15,254
(plane engine humming)

364
00:29:16,255 --> 00:29:20,092
(suspenseful orchestral music)

365
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:04,261
- Well, Dr. Davenport's
keys are still here.

366
00:30:04,553 --> 00:30:06,153
We still have him listed as out of town.

367
00:30:06,305 --> 00:30:07,740
- Oh, well, he was due in before me.

368
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:08,265
I just thought-

369
00:30:08,557 --> 00:30:09,717
- Well, maybe he got held up.

370
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:10,309
- Yeah, maybe.

371
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,412
- You picked the right
time to be out of town.

372
00:30:12,436 --> 00:30:13,145
It's been a killer.

373
00:30:13,437 --> 00:30:14,437
Just awful.

374
00:30:15,439 --> 00:30:16,481
Losing my hair.

375
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:17,316
- Hadn't noticed.

376
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:19,151
- [henry] These tight hats.

377
00:30:19,443 --> 00:30:20,545
They're bad for circulation.

378
00:30:20,569 --> 00:30:21,111
- Is that what it is?

379
00:30:21,403 --> 00:30:22,547
- [Henry] It's bad for the hair.

380
00:30:22,571 --> 00:30:23,571
- Oh.

381
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:25,449
It's okay, Henry.

382
00:30:25,741 --> 00:30:26,241
I can manage.

383
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:27,552
- [Henry] Well, I'm in no hurry.

384
00:30:27,576 --> 00:30:28,076
- It's okay. - [Henry] I'm in no hurry.

385
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:28,994
- It's all right, I can manage.

386
00:30:29,286 --> 00:30:30,430
- [Henry] Enjoy your
evening, Mrs. Davenport.

387
00:30:30,454 --> 00:30:31,454
- Thanks.

388
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:48,305
Good night, Hector.

389
00:30:48,597 --> 00:30:49,597
- Good night.

390
00:30:55,187 --> 00:30:58,690
(dramatic orchestral music)

391
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:24,256
- Alex.

392
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:33,682
Alex.

393
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:43,860
(sighing)

394
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:45,630
- [Woman] This is Dr. Corvin's office.

395
00:31:45,654 --> 00:31:46,154
I'm afraid nobody's in right now.

396
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:47,446
- Oh, shoot.

397
00:31:47,489 --> 00:31:49,133
- [Woman] But if you leave
your message after the tone

398
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:50,909
we'll return your call as soon as possible.

399
00:31:51,201 --> 00:31:51,701
Thank you.

400
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:53,161
- Where are you?

401
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:55,163
(sighs)

402
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:56,455
I'm back in L.A.

403
00:31:57,874 --> 00:32:00,627
I really need to talk to you.

404
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:03,130
Alex is, I'll explain later.

405
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:07,175
But I really need to see you, though.

406
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:11,346
Please, please, please
pick up this message soon.

407
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:16,351
(dramatic orchestral music)

408
00:32:22,274 --> 00:32:23,692
What have I hidden?

409
00:32:25,402 --> 00:32:26,862
What am I hiding?

410
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:51,928
(line ringing)

411
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,380
Yes, this is Marie Davenport.

412
00:32:53,597 --> 00:32:55,807
Are there any messages for me?

413
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:57,243
- [Woman] No, Mrs. Davenport.

414
00:32:57,267 --> 00:32:59,311
All your messages were
picked up this morning.

415
00:32:59,603 --> 00:33:01,062
- No messages at all?

416
00:33:01,354 --> 00:33:02,355
- [Woman] Oh, wait.

417
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:03,356
I'm sorry.

418
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:04,728
There was just one message.

419
00:33:04,774 --> 00:33:06,067
A few minutes after noon.

420
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:09,404
It said, "Meet me in Carmel,
Monday, Cliff view Motel.

421
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:11,406
Call if you can't make it."

422
00:33:11,698 --> 00:33:12,908
- Was that from Daniel Corvin?

423
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,035
- [Woman] It doesn't say who it was from.

424
00:33:15,327 --> 00:33:16,762
But it came in just about an hour ago.

425
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:17,786
(sighs)

426
00:33:17,913 --> 00:33:18,913
- Thank you.

427
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:38,141
(blowing)

428
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:47,651
(dramatic orchestral music)

429
00:34:13,635 --> 00:34:15,345
- Mrs. Davenport?

430
00:34:15,637 --> 00:34:16,637
- Why, yes.

431
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:18,324
- [Man] You're our only
guest for check-in today.

432
00:34:18,348 --> 00:34:18,848
- Oh, I see.

433
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,493
- If I could have your credit card,

434
00:34:20,517 --> 00:34:22,894
and if you would just sign this.

435
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:29,526
Oh, and I have a message for you.

436
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:33,071
From Daniel.

437
00:34:33,363 --> 00:34:38,076
He's real sorry, but he
can't get here until tomorrow.

438
00:34:38,368 --> 00:34:39,368
- Thank you.

439
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:41,368
- Is that all the luggage?

440
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:41,997
- Yes.

441
00:34:42,289 --> 00:34:43,289
I can manage.

442
00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:46,060
- Room's just right over here to the left.

443
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:46,585
- Okay.

444
00:34:46,876 --> 00:34:47,876
Thanks.

445
00:35:14,446 --> 00:35:17,449
I never thought I'd come here again.

446
00:35:17,741 --> 00:35:19,200
Oh, Daniel, why here?

447
00:35:41,056 --> 00:35:44,517
(light orchestral music)

448
00:36:00,742 --> 00:36:02,619
(panting)

449
00:36:21,221 --> 00:36:24,140
(breathing heavily)

450
00:36:57,924 --> 00:37:00,468
(plane engine roaring)

451
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,554
- [Eerie Voice] Marie.

452
00:37:02,846 --> 00:37:04,198
- [Marie Voiceover] I don't believe it.

453
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:05,765
I don't believe it.

454
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:07,600
I don't believe it.

455
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:09,936
I don't want this.

456
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:13,440
- [Eerie Voice] Marie.

457
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:16,443
I choose, I choose.

458
00:37:17,694 --> 00:37:19,195
Yes, yes, yes.

459
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:20,506
- [Marie Voiceover] I choose.

460
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:21,030
I'm for real.

461
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:21,823
I choose.

462
00:37:22,115 --> 00:37:24,909
- [Eerie Voice] Bring me the priest.

463
00:37:26,411 --> 00:37:28,246
- [Marie Voiceover] No!

464
00:38:17,754 --> 00:38:21,257
(dramatic orchestral music)

465
00:38:36,898 --> 00:38:38,817
(gasps)

466
00:39:04,968 --> 00:39:08,096
- [Woman] In 1599, our Lady
of Carmel Among the Butterflies

467
00:39:08,388 --> 00:39:10,181
was donated by Captain Portillo.

468
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:12,593
And thanks for the miraculous
calming of the elements

469
00:39:12,809 --> 00:39:14,729
during which his vessels
were able to come about

470
00:39:14,936 --> 00:39:18,731
and the crew saved from
almost certain shipwreck.

471
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:20,423
The statue itself, which is thought

472
00:39:20,567 --> 00:39:22,110
to be 15th century in origin

473
00:39:22,402 --> 00:39:25,613
was kept by the local Indians until 1891

474
00:39:25,905 --> 00:39:27,448
when it was returned to the mission

475
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:29,742
and placed in this chapel.

476
00:39:38,877 --> 00:39:39,961
- [Sister] Yes, I saw her.

477
00:39:40,253 --> 00:39:41,296
She's gone now.

478
00:39:41,588 --> 00:39:44,591
(church bell tolling)

479
00:40:00,023 --> 00:40:01,023
- Daniel!

480
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:08,114
(knocking on door)

481
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:11,594
(suspenseful orchestral music)

482
00:40:11,618 --> 00:40:12,118
(gasps)

483
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:13,410
Oh, my God!

484
00:40:14,162 --> 00:40:14,787
Alex!

485
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:16,372
- Shut the door.

486
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:17,165
- Alex!

487
00:40:17,457 --> 00:40:17,957
- Don't touch me.

488
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:19,626
- But you're here!

489
00:40:19,918 --> 00:40:20,418
What happened?

490
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:21,210
- I don't want anyone touching me.

491
00:40:21,502 --> 00:40:22,754
- What happened?

492
00:40:23,046 --> 00:40:23,546
Okay.

493
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:24,339
- Sit down.

494
00:40:24,631 --> 00:40:25,173
- Tell me what happened!

495
00:40:25,465 --> 00:40:26,883
- Please sit down.

496
00:40:30,929 --> 00:40:31,929
- Okay.

497
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:33,096
Al right.

498
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:49,697
- Don't stare at me.

499
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:50,989
- Okay.

500
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:52,699
I'm sorry.

501
00:40:55,036 --> 00:40:57,872
- I want you to promise me something.

502
00:40:58,164 --> 00:40:59,164
- Yes.

503
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:03,127
- A promise, Marie.

504
00:41:03,419 --> 00:41:04,629
- All right.

505
00:41:04,921 --> 00:41:06,005
- No questions.

506
00:41:08,675 --> 00:41:10,093
- All right.

507
00:41:10,385 --> 00:41:12,387
- I ask all the questions.

508
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:22,897
The message you left for
me on the answering service.

509
00:41:27,068 --> 00:41:28,861
- You left that for me?

510
00:41:30,113 --> 00:41:31,906
- [Marie] I left it, yes.

511
00:41:43,042 --> 00:41:45,336
- This was an accident.

512
00:41:45,628 --> 00:41:46,963
Wasn't it, Marie?

513
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:48,965
- Oh, Alex, yes.

514
00:41:53,553 --> 00:41:54,553
- Please.

515
00:41:55,263 --> 00:41:56,806
Please, turn away.

516
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,022
I remember swimming.

517
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:10,528
I heard that boat coming at me,

518
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:13,114
as if it were trying to kill me.

519
00:42:13,406 --> 00:42:15,742
(Alex sighs)

520
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:20,038
What did the doctor say?

521
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:23,082
He told me you were dead.

522
00:42:26,419 --> 00:42:28,004
I mean, I saw your-

523
00:42:28,296 --> 00:42:28,921
- No, no.

524
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:30,213
Afterwards.

525
00:42:31,424 --> 00:42:34,135
What did they tell you afterwards?

526
00:42:35,636 --> 00:42:36,888
(sighs)

527
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:39,974
- They swore there were no mistakes.

528
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:43,770
One of them, this man said

529
00:42:44,062 --> 00:42:47,440
if you'd seen dead
bodies as much as he had,

530
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:50,150
then you knew.

531
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:55,865
- What did you think, Marie,

532
00:42:56,157 --> 00:42:59,285
when you were told my body was missing?

533
00:43:03,081 --> 00:43:05,500
- I hoped you were still alive.

534
00:43:06,876 --> 00:43:07,876
- Why?

535
00:43:11,631 --> 00:43:12,631
- Oh, Alex.

536
00:43:16,135 --> 00:43:19,013
Why did you leave the hospital like that?

537
00:43:19,305 --> 00:43:20,014
Why?

538
00:43:20,306 --> 00:43:20,890
If you tell me that

539
00:43:21,182 --> 00:43:24,894
I promise I won't ask
you any more questions.

540
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:34,028
- It doesn't matter, Marie.

541
00:43:36,948 --> 00:43:38,241
- Yes, it matters.

542
00:43:40,118 --> 00:43:41,994
For Christ sake, I matter!

543
00:43:43,204 --> 00:43:46,290
I mean, Alex, why didn't you come to me?

544
00:43:49,502 --> 00:43:50,503
Tell me.

545
00:43:50,795 --> 00:43:51,796
What happened?

546
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:58,219
- I woke up in a cold, dark room.

547
00:44:03,141 --> 00:44:05,977
And I knew right from
the smell of it that it was

548
00:44:06,269 --> 00:44:08,563
a freezer room of the morgue.

549
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:13,317
I was lying there on a cold table.

550
00:44:15,069 --> 00:44:16,069
No pad.

551
00:44:16,237 --> 00:44:18,030
(sniffling)

552
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:19,322
No sheet.

553
00:44:20,449 --> 00:44:21,951
I thought it was a dream.

554
00:44:22,243 --> 00:44:25,037
I thought it was a dream about work.

555
00:44:30,084 --> 00:44:31,502
I was the corpse.

556
00:44:35,173 --> 00:44:36,465
And then I sat up,

557
00:44:39,385 --> 00:44:42,138
and I realized it wasn't a dream.

558
00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:44,974
There was nobody around.

559
00:44:45,266 --> 00:44:46,266
Nobody.

560
00:44:50,771 --> 00:44:54,025
I just got dressed in a pair of scrubs.

561
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:56,359
Got up.

562
00:44:57,111 --> 00:44:58,362
(chuckles)

563
00:44:58,654 --> 00:45:01,115
Even found a pair of old shoes.

564
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:05,036
Walked right past the main desk.

565
00:45:09,665 --> 00:45:11,167
No one even noticed.

566
00:45:18,841 --> 00:45:22,261
They just thought I was getting off work.

567
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:25,180
- Alex, why?

568
00:45:26,474 --> 00:45:28,226
Why did you do that?

569
00:45:30,895 --> 00:45:34,273
Why didn't you tell them what had happened?

570
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:40,905
- I thought someone was trying to kill me.

571
00:45:42,365 --> 00:45:45,076
I had to leave Mexico, Marie.

572
00:45:45,368 --> 00:45:46,368
I was so scared.

573
00:45:48,621 --> 00:45:50,331
I just had to get out.

574
00:45:55,044 --> 00:45:56,044
So paranoid.

575
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:01,592
I just had to go.

576
00:46:01,884 --> 00:46:02,884
That's all.

577
00:46:05,263 --> 00:46:06,681
(sighing)

578
00:46:06,973 --> 00:46:08,224
I'm sorry.

579
00:46:08,516 --> 00:46:09,516
- Oh, Alex.

580
00:46:10,935 --> 00:46:11,935
You're ill.

581
00:46:13,562 --> 00:46:15,982
You must get some help, honey.

582
00:46:16,274 --> 00:46:17,316
- No.

583
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:18,109
No one can know.

584
00:46:18,401 --> 00:46:19,402
Don't you see?

585
00:46:22,029 --> 00:46:25,116
I won't be anything but a medical freak

586
00:46:25,408 --> 00:46:27,201
for the rest of my life.

587
00:46:30,830 --> 00:46:33,165
Go back to your room, Marie.

588
00:46:35,501 --> 00:46:37,044
Sleep for an hour.

589
00:46:43,676 --> 00:46:45,803
- I'll stay here with you.

590
00:46:49,598 --> 00:46:51,726
- Just leave me, will you?

591
00:46:53,144 --> 00:46:54,228
Come back later.

592
00:46:58,691 --> 00:46:59,691
Okay?

593
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:06,239
- Okay.

594
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:09,493
- Marie?

595
00:47:09,785 --> 00:47:10,911
- [Marie] Yeah?

596
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:14,373
- Lock the door.

597
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:15,374
- Yeah.

598
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:16,666
Okay, yeah.

599
00:47:23,382 --> 00:47:26,886
(dramatic orchestral music)

600
00:47:58,334 --> 00:48:02,004
(dramatic orchestral music)

601
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:09,010
Alex.

602
00:48:10,513 --> 00:48:12,223
Alex, can you hear me?

603
00:48:45,005 --> 00:48:47,216
Oh, Alex, what's happening?

604
00:49:07,111 --> 00:49:08,237
"Pulse fading."

605
00:49:12,575 --> 00:49:13,826
60, 40, 20, 10.

606
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:16,162
"Temperature falling?"

607
00:49:16,454 --> 00:49:19,123
(knocking at door)

608
00:49:25,004 --> 00:49:26,004
Daniel.

609
00:49:27,047 --> 00:49:28,507
- Oh, sorry.

610
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:29,800
- That's okay.

611
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:34,305
(thunder rumbling)

612
00:49:38,767 --> 00:49:41,520
(phone ringing)

613
00:49:48,486 --> 00:49:51,238
- Are you trying the right room?

614
00:49:53,574 --> 00:49:55,494
Well, there hasn't been
a reply there all night.

615
00:49:55,701 --> 00:49:58,204
- Yes, that is Mrs. Davenport's room, sir.

616
00:49:58,496 --> 00:49:59,496
- Try 132.

617
00:50:00,789 --> 00:50:01,916
She's in 132.

618
00:50:02,208 --> 00:50:02,708
- Oh.

619
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:03,501
Okay, hold on.

620
00:50:03,792 --> 00:50:04,872
We think we've located her.

621
00:50:04,919 --> 00:50:05,961
Just one minute, please.

622
00:50:06,253 --> 00:50:07,421
- Okay, thank you.

623
00:50:10,132 --> 00:50:13,302
(phone ringing)

624
00:50:13,594 --> 00:50:14,303
- [Marie] Hello?

625
00:50:14,595 --> 00:50:15,595
- Marie?

626
00:50:17,598 --> 00:50:18,265
Marie.

627
00:50:18,557 --> 00:50:19,558
- [Marie] Yes.

628
00:50:20,434 --> 00:50:21,434
- Where've you been?

629
00:50:21,602 --> 00:50:22,662
I've been trying to get you all day.

630
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:23,686
(sighing)

631
00:50:23,729 --> 00:50:24,230
- Oh.

632
00:50:24,522 --> 00:50:26,023
Well, uh, I'm sorry.

633
00:50:26,315 --> 00:50:27,942
- [Daniel] Are you all right?

634
00:50:28,234 --> 00:50:28,734
- Fine.

635
00:50:29,026 --> 00:50:30,026
Yes.

636
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:34,657
- [Daniel] Well, I was worried
when I couldn't reach you.

637
00:50:34,949 --> 00:50:36,951
You sure you're all right?

638
00:50:38,035 --> 00:50:39,035
- Yes.

639
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:42,831
- Look, I'll be there tomorrow, all right?

640
00:50:43,123 --> 00:50:43,624
I've gotta go.

641
00:50:43,916 --> 00:50:45,459
- Thank you for calling.

642
00:50:45,751 --> 00:50:46,835
- [Daniel] Okay.

643
00:50:47,127 --> 00:50:47,628
Okay.

644
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:48,420
- Thank you.

645
00:50:48,712 --> 00:50:49,712
Yes.

646
00:50:56,595 --> 00:50:57,795
(suspenseful orchestral music)

647
00:50:57,846 --> 00:50:59,390
- Who was that?

648
00:50:59,682 --> 00:51:00,724
- The desk.

649
00:51:01,016 --> 00:51:02,016
No one.

650
00:51:07,606 --> 00:51:08,606
- The desk.

651
00:51:10,359 --> 00:51:11,359
No one.

652
00:51:15,948 --> 00:51:19,076
Sometimes, Marie, I have heard things.

653
00:51:21,662 --> 00:51:22,662
I have seen,

654
00:51:25,666 --> 00:51:26,666
seen

655
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:33,549
things I can't remember afterwards.

656
00:51:39,888 --> 00:51:44,810
(birds chirping) (church bell tolling)

657
00:51:50,316 --> 00:51:53,819
(speaking foreign language)

658
00:52:11,128 --> 00:52:11,795
- Ah, Father Niles.

659
00:52:12,087 --> 00:52:12,755
- Oh, yes.

660
00:52:13,047 --> 00:52:15,341
- There's a woman in the visitor's room.

661
00:52:15,633 --> 00:52:17,384
You couldn't, could you?

662
00:52:17,676 --> 00:52:18,761
You think you could-

663
00:52:19,053 --> 00:52:20,053
- Yeah, sure.

664
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:21,137
Just give me 15 minutes.

665
00:52:21,347 --> 00:52:23,390
I'm gonna go shower and I'll be back.

666
00:52:23,682 --> 00:52:24,183
- No, no.

667
00:52:24,475 --> 00:52:25,715
I've got the golf at half past.

668
00:52:25,851 --> 00:52:26,560
I think I could do it quicker myself.

669
00:52:26,852 --> 00:52:27,852
- Oh.

670
00:52:27,895 --> 00:52:28,395
You sure now?

671
00:52:28,687 --> 00:52:29,188
- Oh, yes.

672
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:32,274
35 years teaches you a trick or two.

673
00:52:33,609 --> 00:52:34,609
Oh.

674
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:35,818
- [Marie] Father Cassidy?

675
00:52:35,944 --> 00:52:37,196
- That's right.

676
00:52:37,488 --> 00:52:38,572
And you are Mrs.-

677
00:52:38,864 --> 00:52:40,366
- I'm sorry to disturb you.

678
00:52:40,658 --> 00:52:41,658
You don't know me.

679
00:52:41,825 --> 00:52:43,577
I'm from Los Angeles.

680
00:52:44,828 --> 00:52:48,624
Um, there's something
I'm supposed to tell you.

681
00:52:51,752 --> 00:52:52,752
- Go ahead.

682
00:52:56,173 --> 00:52:58,092
(sighs)

683
00:52:59,718 --> 00:53:02,805
- I don't really know how to begin.

684
00:53:03,097 --> 00:53:07,101
- Well, why don't you sit
down and take your time?

685
00:53:10,604 --> 00:53:12,648
(sighing)

686
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:17,069
- First of all, you're
not gonna believe me.

687
00:53:17,361 --> 00:53:19,822
(both chuckling)

688
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:22,520
And secondly, even though I went

689
00:53:22,783 --> 00:53:24,660
to a convent school and all that

690
00:53:24,952 --> 00:53:26,245
I'm not a Catholic.

691
00:53:27,705 --> 00:53:28,705
I don't believe.

692
00:53:28,831 --> 00:53:30,916
I don't wanna believe.

693
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:34,461
I haven't been to church since I was 15.

694
00:53:34,753 --> 00:53:35,753
- I see.

695
00:53:38,549 --> 00:53:40,592
Uh, do you mind if I sit?

696
00:53:46,765 --> 00:53:49,143
- I was 15 when my mother died.

697
00:53:51,478 --> 00:53:52,478
She was,

698
00:53:53,188 --> 00:53:56,775
she was in a lot of
pain and very frightened.

699
00:53:58,736 --> 00:53:59,737
And I prayed.

700
00:54:03,365 --> 00:54:05,492
I begged God for her life.

701
00:54:07,870 --> 00:54:08,870
But

702
00:54:11,373 --> 00:54:12,416
that's very important,

703
00:54:12,708 --> 00:54:17,504
the fact that I don't believe
in religion or any of that.

704
00:54:17,838 --> 00:54:18,878
My husband doesn't either.

705
00:54:19,131 --> 00:54:20,716
He's a doctor.

706
00:54:21,008 --> 00:54:22,861
- Well, now, the two aren't
necessarily connected.

707
00:54:22,885 --> 00:54:24,678
Being a doctor and a non-believer.

708
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:26,805
- I resent being here.

709
00:54:27,890 --> 00:54:29,600
But I've been forced to come.

710
00:54:29,892 --> 00:54:31,059
- Forced?

711
00:54:31,351 --> 00:54:31,977
Dear me.

712
00:54:32,269 --> 00:54:33,269
- Yes.

713
00:54:33,854 --> 00:54:34,854
Dear me.

714
00:54:36,857 --> 00:54:37,857
Last year,

715
00:54:39,818 --> 00:54:41,195
almost exactly a year ago,

716
00:54:41,487 --> 00:54:42,905
I came up here with my husband.

717
00:54:43,197 --> 00:54:46,784
He was going to a
conference in San Francisco.

718
00:54:47,701 --> 00:54:51,038
And while I was here, I met another man.

719
00:54:54,917 --> 00:54:55,917
A doctor, too.

720
00:54:57,628 --> 00:55:02,132
For the past months, I've
been having an affair with him.

721
00:55:02,424 --> 00:55:03,424
- Ah.

722
00:55:06,887 --> 00:55:08,514
(sighs)

723
00:55:08,806 --> 00:55:12,684
- While they were at the
conference, I was alone.

724
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:13,976
Mostly alone,

725
00:55:14,019 --> 00:55:17,231
and I went on a lot of
walks along the cliffs.

726
00:55:17,523 --> 00:55:19,733
Do you know those cliffs?

727
00:55:20,025 --> 00:55:21,025
- I think so.

728
00:55:21,109 --> 00:55:22,945
Down by the convent?

729
00:55:23,237 --> 00:55:24,780
- Yes.

730
00:55:25,072 --> 00:55:26,072
I, uh,

731
00:55:26,865 --> 00:55:28,826
I found myself looking

732
00:55:30,202 --> 00:55:32,871
down on these two little, like,

733
00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:35,332
like ponds, and,

734
00:55:37,835 --> 00:55:42,464
down below the path, and I
felt something very strange.

735
00:55:44,508 --> 00:55:46,218
It became very silent.

736
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:51,765
As if the sea had stopped moving, and

737
00:55:54,268 --> 00:55:58,605
the branches of the
cypress tree began to move,

738
00:55:58,897 --> 00:56:00,232
and I saw something.

739
00:56:04,736 --> 00:56:07,114
Someone came out just below me.

740
00:56:11,785 --> 00:56:12,785
It was,

741
00:56:15,122 --> 00:56:16,122
she was,

742
00:56:18,166 --> 00:56:20,085
it was a girl, 16 or 17.

743
00:56:25,841 --> 00:56:26,841
She was, uh,

744
00:56:30,721 --> 00:56:35,392
she was surrounded by
this golden path of light, like-

745
00:56:35,684 --> 00:56:36,685
- Like a halo?

746
00:56:39,062 --> 00:56:40,062
- No.

747
00:56:40,939 --> 00:56:42,649
No, not like a halo.

748
00:56:42,941 --> 00:56:43,941
It was,

749
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:47,836
it was more like a spotlight was on her,

750
00:56:47,988 --> 00:56:49,865
a very phony looking light.

751
00:56:50,157 --> 00:56:53,452
And she had a veil and a long, white dress.

752
00:56:56,830 --> 00:56:59,791
And she looked up at me and she said,

753
00:57:02,210 --> 00:57:03,545
"Marie, I am..."

754
00:57:04,922 --> 00:57:06,340
She said she was,

755
00:57:08,383 --> 00:57:09,635
oh, shit.

756
00:57:09,927 --> 00:57:10,927
This is ridiculous.

757
00:57:11,094 --> 00:57:11,762
I don't even believe

758
00:57:12,054 --> 00:57:13,597
in the Virgin Mary.

759
00:57:18,185 --> 00:57:19,185
- Goon.

760
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:23,230
- She said,

761
00:57:25,067 --> 00:57:26,818
"Go and tell the priests."

762
00:57:28,070 --> 00:57:29,070
Bring them.

763
00:57:30,447 --> 00:57:33,367
Rebuild the sanctuary by this place.

764
00:57:34,368 --> 00:57:35,869
That it may prevail.

765
00:57:38,038 --> 00:57:39,038
Go and tell the priests.

766
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:40,289
"Bring them."

767
00:57:42,918 --> 00:57:43,961
That was all.

768
00:57:45,212 --> 00:57:46,212
A sanctuary.

769
00:57:46,338 --> 00:57:47,418
"You will tell the priests.

770
00:57:47,673 --> 00:57:48,673
Bring them."

771
00:57:49,883 --> 00:57:51,885
(scoffs)

772
00:57:53,053 --> 00:57:55,138
(chuckling)

773
00:57:57,891 --> 00:57:58,892
I laughed.

774
00:57:59,184 --> 00:58:01,895
I was frightened, but I laughed.

775
00:58:02,187 --> 00:58:04,106
I mean, me of all people.

776
00:58:05,148 --> 00:58:06,148
It's,

777
00:58:07,651 --> 00:58:11,571
well, then it got very
dark and it began to rain

778
00:58:12,656 --> 00:58:13,782
and the figure

779
00:58:17,995 --> 00:58:18,995
disappeared.

780
00:58:21,707 --> 00:58:23,834
I heard thunder very loud.

781
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:28,839
And I never told anyone.

782
00:58:33,176 --> 00:58:34,176
Damn her.

783
00:58:35,429 --> 00:58:36,429
No priests.

784
00:58:38,056 --> 00:58:39,056
Until you.

785
00:58:39,182 --> 00:58:40,600
Until now.

786
00:58:40,892 --> 00:58:41,892
Damn her.

787
00:58:48,066 --> 00:58:49,985
- A sanctuary, she said?

788
00:58:52,237 --> 00:58:53,488
- Yes.

789
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:55,657
A church, a sanctuary.

790
00:58:55,949 --> 00:58:56,949
- Mmm-hmm.

791
00:58:57,701 --> 00:58:58,701
Mmm-hmm.

792
00:59:00,454 --> 00:59:01,997
What is your name?

793
00:59:03,081 --> 00:59:04,081
- Davenport.

794
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:06,710
Marie Davenport.

795
00:59:07,711 --> 00:59:10,213
Look, it's trying to possess me.

796
00:59:11,339 --> 00:59:12,799
It's destroying my life.

797
00:59:13,091 --> 00:59:15,469
And now it's trying to force me.

798
00:59:19,347 --> 00:59:22,142
It's threatening my husband's life.

799
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:24,513
- It's threatening his life?

800
00:59:24,603 --> 00:59:26,104
I don't understand.

801
00:59:27,064 --> 00:59:29,775
You're still, despite your affair,

802
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:34,571
you're still living with your husband?

803
00:59:34,863 --> 00:59:35,363
- Yes.

804
00:59:35,655 --> 00:59:36,655
I mean,

805
00:59:38,992 --> 00:59:39,992
yes.

806
00:59:47,167 --> 00:59:51,922
- When are you going back
to L.A., Mrs. Davenport?

807
00:59:52,214 --> 00:59:54,007
(sighs)

808
00:59:55,008 --> 00:59:56,008
- I don't know.

809
00:59:58,512 --> 00:59:59,512
(sniffling)

810
00:59:59,596 --> 01:00:02,474
I don't know what I'm supposed to do.

811
01:00:05,310 --> 01:00:07,854
I've done what they've told me.

812
01:00:08,146 --> 01:00:09,564
I told the priest.

813
01:00:13,693 --> 01:00:15,695
Now, maybe it'll be over?

814
01:00:26,123 --> 01:00:28,750
Will there be an investigation?

815
01:00:31,128 --> 01:00:34,965
- Oh, I shouldn't think so, Mrs. Davenport.

816
01:00:35,257 --> 01:00:38,844
The Church is very
careful about these things.

817
01:00:41,179 --> 01:00:43,019
I suppose it comes from
the very human feeling

818
01:00:43,181 --> 01:00:46,309
that if God wants us to know something,

819
01:00:46,601 --> 01:00:48,145
He'll come tell us.

820
01:00:50,188 --> 01:00:51,523
Silly, isn't it?

821
01:00:53,150 --> 01:00:57,737
Such a great institution like
the Church can be so petty.

822
01:01:00,198 --> 01:01:03,243
Prudence born of 2,000 years experience.

823
01:01:15,255 --> 01:01:17,507
It'll be off your mind now.

824
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:22,512
It must have been a
terrible thing to live with.

825
01:01:22,804 --> 01:01:23,906
I want to thank you for coming

826
01:01:23,930 --> 01:01:25,765
and telling me about it, Mrs. Davenport.

827
01:01:26,057 --> 01:01:27,177
It was nice to have met you.

828
01:01:27,392 --> 01:01:28,727
- Is that all then?

829
01:01:29,019 --> 01:01:30,019
- Mmm-hmm.

830
01:01:30,228 --> 01:01:31,229
Now don't worry,

831
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:33,607
it's in my hands now.

832
01:01:33,899 --> 01:01:35,942
You've done your part.

833
01:01:36,234 --> 01:01:39,487
I'm sure that'll be an end to it.

834
01:01:39,779 --> 01:01:41,698
Have a safe journey home.

835
01:02:04,471 --> 01:02:07,098
(line ringing)

836
01:02:28,203 --> 01:02:29,996
(knocking on door)

837
01:02:30,288 --> 01:02:31,288
- Alex?

838
01:02:35,168 --> 01:02:36,168
Alex?

839
01:02:36,336 --> 01:02:39,422
(dramatic orchestral music)

840
01:02:39,714 --> 01:02:41,341
(panting)

841
01:02:41,633 --> 01:02:43,718
Are you all right?

842
01:02:44,010 --> 01:02:45,679
- What are you doing here?

843
01:02:45,971 --> 01:02:46,971
- What?

844
01:02:54,980 --> 01:02:55,980
- Pulse?

845
01:02:58,233 --> 01:02:59,484
- Yes, it stopped.

846
01:03:03,989 --> 01:03:04,989
-It's as if

847
01:03:10,912 --> 01:03:12,205
I went to a place,

848
01:03:16,626 --> 01:03:17,877
I found a place

849
01:03:20,380 --> 01:03:22,257
that knew everything.

850
01:03:30,515 --> 01:03:32,976
I can't remember what it was.

851
01:03:34,311 --> 01:03:35,311
- A dream.

852
01:03:38,606 --> 01:03:39,606
- No.

853
01:03:46,156 --> 01:03:47,156
Yes.

854
01:03:50,243 --> 01:03:51,244
Yes.

855
01:03:51,536 --> 01:03:52,912
A very bright dream.

856
01:03:56,875 --> 01:03:58,335
- I went to tell,

857
01:03:59,753 --> 01:04:01,796
I'm helping you now, Alex.

858
01:04:06,885 --> 01:04:08,595
- I can't remember.

859
01:04:08,887 --> 01:04:09,887
- What?

860
01:04:15,852 --> 01:04:18,480
(waves crashing)

861
01:04:20,398 --> 01:04:21,398
- Yes, it's,

862
01:04:24,861 --> 01:04:26,863
it's as if you were there

863
01:04:27,947 --> 01:04:28,947
with me.

864
01:04:32,744 --> 01:04:34,245
Like you always are.

865
01:04:37,707 --> 01:04:40,835
And I knew everything I've ever known.

866
01:04:42,962 --> 01:04:43,962
Everything.

867
01:04:47,092 --> 01:04:48,092
I just

868
01:04:52,514 --> 01:04:54,140
can't remember now.

869
01:04:56,518 --> 01:04:59,396
(waves crashing)

870
01:05:11,408 --> 01:05:13,451
- Peace be with you, sister.

871
01:05:16,162 --> 01:05:18,498
- I must speak about it now.

872
01:05:18,790 --> 01:05:20,458
This is not confession.

873
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:22,544
This is not confession, Father.

874
01:05:22,836 --> 01:05:24,629
But I must tell someone.

875
01:05:26,256 --> 01:05:27,882
For more than a year-

876
01:05:29,426 --> 01:05:30,426
- Yes?

877
01:05:31,344 --> 01:05:32,344
- For more than a year

878
01:05:32,595 --> 01:05:36,099
I've had the same dream tormenting me.

879
01:05:36,391 --> 01:05:37,391
- Go on, sister.

880
01:05:39,269 --> 01:05:41,771
- A woman, frightened, obsessed,

881
01:05:42,897 --> 01:05:45,817
a woman haunted by the Virgin Mary.

882
01:05:46,109 --> 01:05:48,194
The Holy Mother begs this woman

883
01:05:48,486 --> 01:05:49,988
to build a sanctuary.

884
01:05:54,742 --> 01:05:57,287
- Is this a woman who's known to you?

885
01:05:57,579 --> 01:05:58,079
- No.

886
01:05:58,371 --> 01:05:59,622
She's just a woman.

887
01:06:00,623 --> 01:06:01,958
Quite young.

888
01:06:02,250 --> 01:06:03,250
No one I knew.

889
01:06:03,418 --> 01:06:04,418
Until yesterday,

890
01:06:05,503 --> 01:06:07,297
when she visited with us.

891
01:06:07,589 --> 01:06:08,589
-Hmm.

892
01:06:09,466 --> 01:06:11,217
- I know her name.

893
01:06:11,509 --> 01:06:12,509
Marie Davenport.

894
01:06:24,606 --> 01:06:27,609
(phone ringing)

895
01:06:27,901 --> 01:06:29,903
- [Woman] Cliff view Motel.

896
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:33,656
(woman chattering)

897
01:07:00,433 --> 01:07:02,018
- Oh, Daniel.

898
01:07:02,310 --> 01:07:04,020
Oh, thank God you're here.

899
01:07:04,312 --> 01:07:05,432
- What the hell is going on?

900
01:07:05,605 --> 01:07:09,442
(light acoustic guitar music)

901
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:14,280
What's wrong?

902
01:07:24,582 --> 01:07:25,833
- Alex is here.

903
01:07:27,544 --> 01:07:28,544
- What?

904
01:07:29,462 --> 01:07:30,547
- He's very ill.

905
01:07:32,257 --> 01:07:34,551
He was in a terrible accident.

906
01:07:35,969 --> 01:07:37,220
- Jesus Christ.

907
01:07:39,514 --> 01:07:42,392
- Daniel, it's been so difficult.

908
01:07:45,478 --> 01:07:47,355
I'll try and explain.

909
01:08:04,956 --> 01:08:06,541
- Did you tell him about us?

910
01:08:06,833 --> 01:08:07,834
(sighs)

911
01:08:08,126 --> 01:08:08,835
- I couldn't.

912
01:08:09,127 --> 01:08:11,129
(sighing)

913
01:08:26,477 --> 01:08:30,189
- You were with him
last night when I called?

914
01:08:30,481 --> 01:08:31,482
- It wasn't like that.

915
01:08:31,774 --> 01:08:33,443
- You weren't with him?

916
01:08:34,652 --> 01:08:36,154
- Yes, I was, but...

917
01:08:47,832 --> 01:08:48,958
- I left Anna.

918
01:08:52,754 --> 01:08:53,921
- Daniel, I'm sorry.

919
01:08:54,213 --> 01:08:55,340
- You're what?

920
01:08:55,632 --> 01:08:56,632
You're sorry?

921
01:08:59,552 --> 01:09:01,095
- I'm sorry, but he's my husband.

922
01:09:01,387 --> 01:09:04,849
I just can't leave him in that state.

923
01:09:05,141 --> 01:09:07,143
I can't just turn my back.

924
01:09:08,686 --> 01:09:09,686
I mean,

925
01:09:10,730 --> 01:09:14,776
I don't all of a sudden
just hate him or something.

926
01:09:15,068 --> 01:09:16,068
And it's,

927
01:09:17,862 --> 01:09:19,572
it's still there, the,

928
01:09:21,616 --> 01:09:23,409
all the time, the past.

929
01:09:28,665 --> 01:09:30,083
The intimacy, whatever.

930
01:09:30,375 --> 01:09:31,375
I don't know.

931
01:09:31,501 --> 01:09:32,501
It's just,

932
01:09:33,670 --> 01:09:36,005
I can't turn my back on him.

933
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:43,304
- What, are you telling me
something I don't wanna hear?

934
01:09:47,767 --> 01:09:48,767
- [Marie] It'll be okay.

935
01:09:48,851 --> 01:09:49,560
- It'll be okay!

936
01:09:49,852 --> 01:09:50,436
Jesus Christ.

937
01:09:50,728 --> 01:09:51,728
Marie.

938
01:09:58,945 --> 01:10:00,363
Do you still love me?

939
01:10:00,655 --> 01:10:03,574
(light acoustic guitar music)

940
01:10:03,866 --> 01:10:04,866
- Yes.

941
01:10:08,913 --> 01:10:09,913
I'm sorry.

942
01:10:35,940 --> 01:10:37,066
- Who's there?

943
01:10:39,569 --> 01:10:40,569
Marie?

944
01:10:42,739 --> 01:10:43,739
- It's me.

945
01:10:48,661 --> 01:10:49,661
I'm here, Alex.

946
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:55,250
Um,

947
01:10:57,420 --> 01:10:59,338
I brought Daniel Corvin.

948
01:11:02,216 --> 01:11:03,342
He's a doctor.

949
01:11:04,594 --> 01:11:08,264
(suspenseful orchestral music)

950
01:11:08,556 --> 01:11:10,224
I just thought

951
01:11:10,516 --> 01:11:14,479
he should check and
make sure you're all right.

952
01:11:14,771 --> 01:11:17,857
You left me again for two or three hours.

953
01:11:19,567 --> 01:11:21,486
I was worried about you.

954
01:11:42,715 --> 01:11:44,467
- Alex, it's Daniel.

955
01:11:49,472 --> 01:11:51,390
(sighs)

956
01:11:58,773 --> 01:12:01,275
Do you feel any dizziness at all?

957
01:12:03,027 --> 01:12:03,653
Hmm?

958
01:12:03,945 --> 01:12:04,945
Any nausea?

959
01:12:10,910 --> 01:12:14,747
(suspenseful orchestral music)

960
01:12:32,974 --> 01:12:34,934
- [Man] Some 73,000 people.

961
01:12:37,311 --> 01:12:37,937
(gasping)

962
01:12:38,229 --> 01:12:38,729
- Oh, my God!

963
01:12:39,021 --> 01:12:40,021
- I'm sorry.

964
01:12:40,064 --> 01:12:40,565
- Oh, sorry.

965
01:12:40,857 --> 01:12:41,858
It's my fault.

966
01:12:42,859 --> 01:12:45,444
A priest always gives me a scare.

967
01:12:45,736 --> 01:12:49,907
Priests always come when
you're, you know, dying.

968
01:12:50,199 --> 01:12:51,200
- Mrs. Davenport.

969
01:12:51,492 --> 01:12:52,660
She's not expecting me, but-

970
01:12:52,952 --> 01:12:53,952
- Gone up to the city.

971
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:56,120
Sorry, you missed her by
maybe 15 minutes, Father.

972
01:12:56,205 --> 01:12:56,914
- Oh.

973
01:12:57,206 --> 01:12:57,832
- [Man] Someone took sick.

974
01:12:58,124 --> 01:13:00,209
She took him up to the hospital.

975
01:13:00,501 --> 01:13:01,502
- San Francisco?

976
01:13:01,794 --> 01:13:03,045
- San Francisco, yes.

977
01:13:03,337 --> 01:13:04,337
- Thank you.

978
01:13:06,924 --> 01:13:07,925
- [Man] Fresno.

979
01:13:08,217 --> 01:13:09,677
This ball game, statistically,

980
01:13:09,969 --> 01:13:13,639
and yet only three points
up on the scoreboard.

981
01:13:14,807 --> 01:13:18,311
(dramatic orchestral music)

982
01:13:39,957 --> 01:13:42,460
(siren wailing)

983
01:13:54,180 --> 01:13:56,515
- Tell me nothing's changed.

984
01:14:00,978 --> 01:14:03,105
Tell me nothing's changed.

985
01:14:04,732 --> 01:14:05,900
Tell me.

986
01:14:06,192 --> 01:14:07,192
Tell me.

987
01:14:09,654 --> 01:14:11,781
Tell me nothing's changed.

988
01:14:13,950 --> 01:14:15,826
(gasping)

989
01:14:17,244 --> 01:14:18,964
- You wanted to talk to me about something.

990
01:14:19,038 --> 01:14:20,038
What was it?

991
01:14:20,081 --> 01:14:22,583
(Marie crying)

992
01:14:23,668 --> 01:14:26,504
(both panting)

993
01:14:26,796 --> 01:14:27,796
- Love me!

994
01:14:28,005 --> 01:14:29,005
Love me!

995
01:14:29,048 --> 01:14:30,048
(crying)

996
01:14:30,174 --> 01:14:31,175
- Stop it.

997
01:14:31,467 --> 01:14:32,467
Stop it.

998
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:39,975
- Love me!

999
01:14:40,101 --> 01:14:40,810
- Stop it.

1000
01:14:41,102 --> 01:14:42,102
Stop it!

1001
01:14:42,269 --> 01:14:42,770
Stop it!

1002
01:14:43,062 --> 01:14:44,062
Stop it!

1003
01:14:44,105 --> 01:14:44,605
- Love me!

1004
01:14:44,897 --> 01:14:45,398
- Stop it!

1005
01:14:45,690 --> 01:14:46,399
Stop it, stop it!

1006
01:14:46,691 --> 01:14:47,274
(screaming)

1007
01:14:47,566 --> 01:14:48,067
Stop it!

1008
01:14:48,359 --> 01:14:48,859
Stop it!

1009
01:14:49,151 --> 01:14:50,151
Stop it!

1010
01:14:50,194 --> 01:14:51,862
- Don't leave!

1011
01:14:52,154 --> 01:14:53,154
Don't leave.

1012
01:14:56,283 --> 01:14:57,368
- What's wrong?

1013
01:14:57,660 --> 01:14:58,160
What's wrong?

1014
01:14:58,452 --> 01:14:58,953
What's wrong?

1015
01:14:59,245 --> 01:14:59,912
- Love me!

1016
01:15:00,204 --> 01:15:01,204
- What's wrong?

1017
01:15:01,247 --> 01:15:01,831
- Love me! (sobbing)

1018
01:15:02,123 --> 01:15:05,501
(dramatic orchestral music)

1019
01:15:06,502 --> 01:15:08,629
(sobbing)

1020
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:10,923
- It's all right.

1021
01:15:11,215 --> 01:15:12,215
It's all right.

1022
01:15:15,803 --> 01:15:17,013
It's all right.

1023
01:15:18,180 --> 01:15:19,390
It's all right.

1024
01:15:22,685 --> 01:15:23,978
It's all right.

1025
01:15:24,270 --> 01:15:25,479
It's all right.

1026
01:15:25,771 --> 01:15:26,771
It's all right.

1027
01:15:26,939 --> 01:15:27,440
Marie.

1028
01:15:27,732 --> 01:15:28,732
It's all right.

1029
01:15:28,858 --> 01:15:30,067
It's all right.

1030
01:15:30,359 --> 01:15:30,901
It's all right.

1031
01:15:31,193 --> 01:15:33,487
(sobbing)

1032
01:15:33,779 --> 01:15:34,779
It's all right.

1033
01:15:34,864 --> 01:15:35,864
It's all right.

1034
01:15:35,990 --> 01:15:36,990
It's all right.

1035
01:15:37,158 --> 01:15:38,158
It's all right.

1036
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:42,246
(knocking on door)

1037
01:15:42,538 --> 01:15:44,999
(shower running)

1038
01:15:58,929 --> 01:16:00,056
- Mrs. Davenport?

1039
01:16:01,390 --> 01:16:02,850
I'm Father Niles.

1040
01:16:04,685 --> 01:16:09,273
I'm a colleague of Monsignor
Cassidy who you spoke to.

1041
01:16:09,565 --> 01:16:10,608
- How did you find me?

1042
01:16:10,900 --> 01:16:13,694
- I called in at the motel and they,

1043
01:16:14,653 --> 01:16:16,280
I just wondered if we could talk.

1044
01:16:16,572 --> 01:16:17,073
I'm sorry.

1045
01:16:17,364 --> 01:16:18,365
I didn't realize.

1046
01:16:18,657 --> 01:16:19,158
- No.

1047
01:16:19,450 --> 01:16:21,368
I don't want to talk.

1048
01:16:21,660 --> 01:16:22,369
My husband's better.

1049
01:16:22,661 --> 01:16:23,954
He's much better.

1050
01:16:24,246 --> 01:16:28,125
- Monsignor Cassidy told
me about what you've seen,

1051
01:16:28,417 --> 01:16:30,419
what you thought that you'd seen.

1052
01:16:30,711 --> 01:16:32,046
- I don't want to talk to you.

1053
01:16:32,338 --> 01:16:33,631
To any of you.

1054
01:16:33,923 --> 01:16:34,941
- Are you sure, Mrs. Davenport?

1055
01:16:34,965 --> 01:16:35,466
- Yes.

1056
01:16:35,758 --> 01:16:37,885
My husband is fine now.

1057
01:16:38,177 --> 01:16:39,177
It's over.

1058
01:16:39,303 --> 01:16:40,303
It's finished.

1059
01:16:53,150 --> 01:16:58,072
(screaming) (alarm beeping)

1060
01:16:59,031 --> 01:17:00,031
- I've gotta get going.

1061
01:17:00,199 --> 01:17:02,076
I'm gonna miss my flight.

1062
01:17:03,452 --> 01:17:05,052
I promise I'll be back as soon as I can.

1063
01:17:05,287 --> 01:17:05,788
(sighing)

1064
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:06,580
- I'll be okay.

1065
01:17:06,872 --> 01:17:07,373
- Are you gonna be all right?

1066
01:17:07,665 --> 01:17:08,665
- Yeah.

1067
01:17:12,169 --> 01:17:13,169
Oh, shit.

1068
01:17:14,588 --> 01:17:15,588
I'm sorry.

1069
01:17:17,424 --> 01:17:18,424
- It's okay.

1070
01:17:19,260 --> 01:17:21,470
You can get me another one,

1071
01:17:24,140 --> 01:17:27,643
you know, when all
this is straightened out.

1072
01:17:37,653 --> 01:17:38,653
I love you.

1073
01:17:38,779 --> 01:17:39,779
- I know.

1074
01:17:40,239 --> 01:17:41,239
I know.

1075
01:17:42,241 --> 01:17:43,534
- I'll call you.

1076
01:17:58,215 --> 01:18:00,801
(beeping)

1077
01:18:01,093 --> 01:18:02,404
- Check that thermometer, will you?

1078
01:18:02,428 --> 01:18:04,068
His temperature readings aren't possible.

1079
01:18:04,221 --> 01:18:04,930
- They checked okay.

1080
01:18:05,222 --> 01:18:06,324
- [Man] Nobody, nobody drops

1081
01:18:06,348 --> 01:18:08,285
to those levels until about
five minutes after death.

1082
01:18:08,309 --> 01:18:09,685
- This is Mrs. Davenport.

1083
01:18:09,977 --> 01:18:10,477
- [Man] Good morning.

1084
01:18:10,769 --> 01:18:11,395
- Good morning.

1085
01:18:11,687 --> 01:18:12,354
- Is he-

1086
01:18:12,646 --> 01:18:14,690
- His vital signs are stable now.

1087
01:18:14,982 --> 01:18:16,108
The crisis is over.

1088
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:17,401
He just seemed to-

1089
01:18:17,693 --> 01:18:18,693
- Marie.

1090
01:18:18,777 --> 01:18:19,777
- I'm here Alex.

1091
01:18:19,904 --> 01:18:20,404
I'm here.

1092
01:18:20,696 --> 01:18:21,696
- Marie.

1093
01:18:23,282 --> 01:18:24,282
- Yes.

1094
01:18:26,243 --> 01:18:28,370
- What is it, Marie?

1095
01:18:28,662 --> 01:18:29,662
- What?

1096
01:18:31,165 --> 01:18:32,958
- Why is this going on?

1097
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:37,254
I keep seeing you all the time.

1098
01:18:37,546 --> 01:18:38,546
Always.

1099
01:18:39,256 --> 01:18:40,256
As if you...

1100
01:18:43,636 --> 01:18:45,429
What's going on, Marie?

1101
01:18:47,389 --> 01:18:48,389
Tell me.

1102
01:18:50,142 --> 01:18:51,142
Tell me!

1103
01:18:51,977 --> 01:18:56,899
(screaming) (alarm beeping)

1104
01:18:57,316 --> 01:18:57,983
- Hold him down!

1105
01:18:58,275 --> 01:19:00,736
Five mil valium, stat.

1106
01:19:01,028 --> 01:19:03,405
- [Marie] Somebody do something.

1107
01:19:03,697 --> 01:19:04,907
- [Man] Come on.

1108
01:19:06,992 --> 01:19:08,911
- He's calming down.

1109
01:19:09,203 --> 01:19:09,745
(screams)

1110
01:19:10,037 --> 01:19:10,537
(Marie crying)

1111
01:19:10,829 --> 01:19:12,164
- [Man] Let's go.

1112
01:19:13,165 --> 01:19:14,165
(retching)

1113
01:19:14,416 --> 01:19:16,627
(sobbing)

1114
01:19:16,919 --> 01:19:18,355
- [Man] Damn it, get his IV back in!

1115
01:19:18,379 --> 01:19:20,130
(gasping)

1116
01:19:25,094 --> 01:19:26,595
- It's all right. (sobbing)

1117
01:19:26,887 --> 01:19:27,972
Here.

1118
01:19:28,264 --> 01:19:29,264
It's all right.

1119
01:19:43,445 --> 01:19:47,116
I think we better talk, Mrs. Davenport.

1120
01:19:47,408 --> 01:19:51,036
(dramatic orchestral music)

1121
01:20:02,548 --> 01:20:03,548
- And then,

1122
01:20:05,217 --> 01:20:07,845
and then suddenly he was gone.

1123
01:20:08,137 --> 01:20:10,597
It was as if I wasn't in
control of my own life,

1124
01:20:10,889 --> 01:20:12,308
of my own destiny.

1125
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:14,600
So, I ran.

1126
01:20:19,898 --> 01:20:21,233
- Dr. Davenport?

1127
01:20:22,818 --> 01:20:25,863
(footsteps thudding)

1128
01:20:28,198 --> 01:20:30,826
- That day I'd tell him it ended.

1129
01:20:32,870 --> 01:20:33,912
We'd planned it.

1130
01:20:34,204 --> 01:20:35,204
Daniel and |I.

1131
01:20:37,207 --> 01:20:40,085
We'd planned that I would tell him.

1132
01:20:40,377 --> 01:20:44,715
(grunting) (beeping)

1133
01:20:47,259 --> 01:20:50,262
I sat there with him like an assassin

1134
01:20:52,056 --> 01:20:53,349
beside her victim.

1135
01:20:55,100 --> 01:20:59,229
Only this assassin had
been given a second chance.

1136
01:21:00,689 --> 01:21:02,483
(sighs)

1137
01:21:02,775 --> 01:21:05,569
And there were the butterflies again

1138
01:21:08,197 --> 01:21:12,618
as if they were leading me
straight back to that place.

1139
01:21:13,660 --> 01:21:15,579
- [Nurse] Dr. Davenport?

1140
01:21:18,832 --> 01:21:20,167
Watch my finger.

1141
01:21:22,795 --> 01:21:25,005
- We are not made or unmade

1142
01:21:26,048 --> 01:21:28,801
by the things that happen to us.

1143
01:21:29,093 --> 01:21:32,179
It's our reaction to them that matters.

1144
01:21:34,306 --> 01:21:36,266
That's all God cares about.

1145
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:40,104
Do you understand?

1146
01:21:41,105 --> 01:21:43,232
(sighs)

1147
01:21:43,524 --> 01:21:44,524
- No, I don't.

1148
01:21:46,777 --> 01:21:47,777
- A miracle,

1149
01:21:49,905 --> 01:21:52,157
if that is what you saw,

1150
01:21:52,449 --> 01:21:53,784
it's only a sign,

1151
01:21:54,910 --> 01:21:57,246
it can never compel consent.

1152
01:21:59,832 --> 01:22:02,232
There's no reason to believe
that your husband's illness has

1153
01:22:02,334 --> 01:22:04,711
anything to do with any of this.

1154
01:22:05,879 --> 01:22:07,005
- But he died.

1155
01:22:11,427 --> 01:22:13,887
And then he came back two, three times.

1156
01:22:14,179 --> 01:22:15,179
Oh.

1157
01:22:15,389 --> 01:22:16,640
I don't know anymore.

1158
01:22:16,932 --> 01:22:18,368
- And to most that would
seem like some kind

1159
01:22:18,392 --> 01:22:19,977
of demonic possession.

1160
01:22:21,478 --> 01:22:22,478
- Yes.

1161
01:22:22,688 --> 01:22:23,688
Yes, it does.

1162
01:22:27,484 --> 01:22:28,484
- But Satan

1163
01:22:30,404 --> 01:22:33,490
has no power over a man's life or death.

1164
01:22:35,868 --> 01:22:37,578
Only God touches that.

1165
01:22:40,497 --> 01:22:42,958
Life and death belong to God.

1166
01:22:44,835 --> 01:22:46,336
And everything else,

1167
01:22:48,005 --> 01:22:49,381
everything is ours,

1168
01:22:53,427 --> 01:22:55,471
yours and mine to decide.

1169
01:23:00,142 --> 01:23:02,686
(light clicking)

1170
01:23:17,534 --> 01:23:19,244
- [Marie] Do you wanna go back home?

1171
01:23:19,536 --> 01:23:20,536
- Doctor.

1172
01:23:20,579 --> 01:23:24,208
- No, I want us both to go
back up to Carmel again.

1173
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:25,876
(sighing)

1174
01:23:26,168 --> 01:23:28,170
- If that's what you want.

1175
01:23:39,932 --> 01:23:40,932
- Corvin.

1176
01:23:44,561 --> 01:23:45,561
Daniel Corvin.

1177
01:23:48,565 --> 01:23:49,775
- What about him?

1178
01:23:52,444 --> 01:23:54,530
- Why did he come to Carmel?

1179
01:23:57,824 --> 01:23:59,284
Did you call him?

1180
01:24:00,536 --> 01:24:01,536
- Yes.

1181
01:24:03,747 --> 01:24:04,747
- Why?

1182
01:24:06,124 --> 01:24:07,334
- Because he's a doctor.

1183
01:24:07,626 --> 01:24:08,919
Because I was worried about you.

1184
01:24:09,211 --> 01:24:12,464
- Why didn't you call a doctor from Carmel?

1185
01:24:14,508 --> 01:24:16,552
What's going on, Marie?

1186
01:24:18,470 --> 01:24:19,781
Did you tell him about what happened

1187
01:24:19,805 --> 01:24:22,474
in the hospital there in Acapulco?

1188
01:24:22,766 --> 01:24:23,267
- Yes.

1189
01:24:23,559 --> 01:24:24,559
- Yes.

1190
01:24:26,353 --> 01:24:26,979
Yes.

1191
01:24:27,271 --> 01:24:28,480
I guess you did.

1192
01:24:30,023 --> 01:24:31,023
I'm sorry.

1193
01:24:36,738 --> 01:24:37,738
- Oh, Alex.

1194
01:24:39,700 --> 01:24:40,700
- Yes?

1195
01:25:02,639 --> 01:25:06,143
(dramatic orchestral music)

1196
01:25:30,167 --> 01:25:34,421
I wish I could remember
the last time we made love.

1197
01:25:56,777 --> 01:25:59,613
(thunder rumbling)

1198
01:25:59,905 --> 01:26:01,615
Come, lay beside me.

1199
01:26:01,907 --> 01:26:05,285
(dramatic orchestral music)

1200
01:26:17,089 --> 01:26:18,757
Just beside me, Marie.

1201
01:26:26,932 --> 01:26:28,350
No one will know.

1202
01:26:46,702 --> 01:26:48,286
You know what I wish?

1203
01:26:53,792 --> 01:26:55,752
I wish that we could go on.

1204
01:27:04,302 --> 01:27:07,639
(thunder rumbling)

1205
01:27:07,931 --> 01:27:10,142
(grunting)

1206
01:27:10,434 --> 01:27:11,560
Marie!

1207
01:27:11,852 --> 01:27:12,394
- I'm here.

1208
01:27:12,686 --> 01:27:13,686
I'm here.

1209
01:27:14,271 --> 01:27:15,564
- You can save us.

1210
01:27:17,482 --> 01:27:19,276
(grunting)

1211
01:27:19,568 --> 01:27:20,569
- Alex.

1212
01:27:20,861 --> 01:27:21,570
Alex!

1213
01:27:21,862 --> 01:27:22,571
- Save me.

1214
01:27:22,863 --> 01:27:23,363
- Alex?

1215
01:27:23,655 --> 01:27:24,156
What?

1216
01:27:24,448 --> 01:27:24,948
Are you all right?

1217
01:27:25,240 --> 01:27:25,741
Stop it.

1218
01:27:26,032 --> 01:27:27,367
Alex!

1219
01:27:27,659 --> 01:27:29,035
- Bring the priests!

1220
01:27:30,704 --> 01:27:31,704
- What?

1221
01:27:31,872 --> 01:27:33,707
(Alex screaming)

1222
01:27:33,999 --> 01:27:35,083
(glass shattering)

1223
01:27:35,375 --> 01:27:37,586
(screaming)

1224
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:42,466
Okay!

1225
01:27:42,758 --> 01:27:43,258
Okay!

1226
01:27:43,550 --> 01:27:46,386
I'm going, I'm going! - God!

1227
01:27:46,678 --> 01:27:48,805
(groaning)

1228
01:27:55,395 --> 01:27:57,689
(gasping)

1229
01:27:57,981 --> 01:28:00,525
(phone ringing)

1230
01:28:10,744 --> 01:28:11,453
- Hello?

1231
01:28:11,745 --> 01:28:12,370
- [Marie] Father Niles?

1232
01:28:12,662 --> 01:28:13,163
- Yes?

1233
01:28:13,455 --> 01:28:14,455
- Father, I,

1234
01:28:14,664 --> 01:28:16,166
I don't know what's happening.

1235
01:28:16,458 --> 01:28:17,667
(screaming)

1236
01:28:17,959 --> 01:28:18,460
- All right.

1237
01:28:18,752 --> 01:28:19,752
Al right.

1238
01:28:23,256 --> 01:28:24,716
(knocking on door)

1239
01:28:25,008 --> 01:28:26,008
Monsignor.

1240
01:28:29,805 --> 01:28:31,681
(owl hooting)

1241
01:28:31,973 --> 01:28:32,973
(wind howling)

1242
01:28:33,058 --> 01:28:34,142
(knocking on door)

1243
01:28:34,434 --> 01:28:36,812
(door creaking)

1244
01:28:56,081 --> 01:28:59,084
(chattering prayers)

1245
01:29:12,097 --> 01:29:15,016
(voices whispering)

1246
01:29:23,733 --> 01:29:26,570
(thunder rumbling)

1247
01:29:32,659 --> 01:29:34,202
- I know this place.

1248
01:29:34,494 --> 01:29:36,121
(gasps)

1249
01:29:36,413 --> 01:29:37,873
I know this place.

1250
01:29:38,164 --> 01:29:39,457
I've never spoken of it

1251
01:29:39,749 --> 01:29:42,252
or of you until last week in confession.

1252
01:29:42,544 --> 01:29:45,922
I dreamed a dream that happens here,

1253
01:29:46,214 --> 01:29:47,841
that happens to you.

1254
01:29:49,968 --> 01:29:53,471
(dramatic orchestral music)

1255
01:29:59,102 --> 01:30:02,856
(speaking foreign language)

1256
01:30:04,983 --> 01:30:06,568
- [Eerie Voice] Marie.

1257
01:30:06,860 --> 01:30:09,112
(wind howling)

1258
01:30:15,243 --> 01:30:16,243
Marie.

1259
01:30:19,706 --> 01:30:21,917
(grunting)

1260
01:30:24,127 --> 01:30:27,672
(eerie voices chattering)

1261
01:30:36,431 --> 01:30:38,767
(screaming)

1262
01:30:41,478 --> 01:30:44,314
(thunder rumbling)

1263
01:31:03,416 --> 01:31:05,669
(grunting)

1264
01:31:12,175 --> 01:31:15,053
(groaning)

1265
01:31:15,345 --> 01:31:18,056
(thunder crashing)

1266
01:31:25,021 --> 01:31:28,817
(speaking foreign language)

1267
01:31:29,109 --> 01:31:31,444
(whimpering)

1268
01:31:55,385 --> 01:31:56,385
- [Martha] The cross!

1269
01:31:56,511 --> 01:31:57,846
Marie, look!

1270
01:31:58,138 --> 01:31:59,138
The cross!

1271
01:31:59,222 --> 01:32:01,016
(crying)

1272
01:32:04,102 --> 01:32:05,895
- [Marie] Nothing else?

1273
01:32:08,273 --> 01:32:09,774
- I found something.

1274
01:32:10,066 --> 01:32:11,066
- You saw nothing else?

1275
01:32:11,192 --> 01:32:12,402
- Nothing.

1276
01:32:12,694 --> 01:32:13,694
Marie?

1277
01:32:14,237 --> 01:32:16,114
Marie, what did you see?

1278
01:32:16,406 --> 01:32:17,406
- Nothing.

1279
01:32:17,574 --> 01:32:18,074
- [Martha] Marie?

1280
01:32:18,366 --> 01:32:18,867
- Nothing!

1281
01:32:19,159 --> 01:32:20,439
I saw nothing, nothing, nothing!

1282
01:32:20,702 --> 01:32:21,703
- Mariel

1283
01:32:21,995 --> 01:32:23,431
- I saw nothing! - What did you see?

1284
01:32:23,455 --> 01:32:25,582
- Nothing! - What did you see?

1285
01:32:25,874 --> 01:32:26,583
(crying)

1286
01:32:26,875 --> 01:32:27,875
- Oh, God!

1287
01:32:42,057 --> 01:32:43,057
- Marie?

1288
01:32:49,439 --> 01:32:52,817
- So, you did manage to bring the priests.

1289
01:32:53,109 --> 01:32:55,028
- Monsignor, the cross.

1290
01:32:56,279 --> 01:32:57,279
Look.

1291
01:33:12,128 --> 01:33:13,421
- It's incredible.

1292
01:33:15,548 --> 01:33:16,883
It's incredible.

1293
01:33:20,053 --> 01:33:23,723
Then, you yourself saw this happen?

1294
01:33:24,015 --> 01:33:25,100
- The sky was dark.

1295
01:33:25,391 --> 01:33:26,726
There was thunder.

1296
01:33:27,018 --> 01:33:29,729
And the sea became completely calm.

1297
01:33:31,815 --> 01:33:33,733
- [Cassidy] But you saw.

1298
01:33:35,068 --> 01:33:36,068
- Nothing.

1299
01:33:38,363 --> 01:33:39,906
I felt a presence.

1300
01:33:45,286 --> 01:33:47,622
It is a miracle, Monsignor.

1301
01:33:47,914 --> 01:33:48,914
My dream.

1302
01:33:49,582 --> 01:33:51,084
The calming.

1303
01:33:51,376 --> 01:33:56,172
His holy burden marked here
on the cliff beside our convent.

1304
01:33:59,217 --> 01:34:00,426
- Mrs. Davenport?

1305
01:34:00,718 --> 01:34:04,097
(dramatic orchestral music)

1306
01:34:32,250 --> 01:34:35,044
- Perhaps, Mrs. Davenport,

1307
01:34:35,336 --> 01:34:37,130
it was all just for you.

1308
01:34:39,257 --> 01:34:40,257
- Just for me?

1309
01:34:40,466 --> 01:34:41,466
(scoffing)

1310
01:34:41,634 --> 01:34:44,220
Things like that don't happen.

1311
01:34:44,512 --> 01:34:47,765
- We are none of us obliged
to believe in miracles any more

1312
01:34:48,057 --> 01:34:52,145
than in aliens from outer
space unless we see them.

1313
01:34:53,062 --> 01:34:54,063
- It's over.

1314
01:34:54,355 --> 01:34:55,398
- No.

1315
01:34:55,690 --> 01:34:57,108
It's hardly begun.

1316
01:34:58,401 --> 01:34:59,401
Marie.

1317
01:35:01,237 --> 01:35:03,239
(light orchestral music)

1318
01:35:03,531 --> 01:35:04,531
Something,

1319
01:35:04,616 --> 01:35:08,036
something surely happened, Mrs. Davenport.

1320
01:35:09,954 --> 01:35:13,917
And now you are not alone in knowing it.

1321
01:35:14,209 --> 01:35:16,211
(sighing)

1322
01:35:17,170 --> 01:35:19,047
- But I choose to deny it.

1323
01:35:22,217 --> 01:35:24,260
Is that what they want?

1324
01:35:25,178 --> 01:35:27,138
A shrine to a lie?

1325
01:35:27,430 --> 01:35:29,224
- Rebuild the sanctuary.

1326
01:35:33,519 --> 01:35:34,896
What is a sanctuary?

1327
01:35:35,188 --> 01:35:36,731
It is a refuge.

1328
01:35:37,023 --> 01:35:38,274
It is a safe haven.

1329
01:35:42,153 --> 01:35:45,740
Have you not heard of
the refuge in marriage?

1330
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:51,079
The safe haven of one's husband or wife?

1331
01:35:51,371 --> 01:35:53,373
The sanctuary of marriage.

1332
01:35:57,919 --> 01:35:59,921
It, too, is a holy place.

1333
01:36:04,050 --> 01:36:05,969
It's a long, hard road back to a faith

1334
01:36:06,261 --> 01:36:07,261
that you've once lost.

1335
01:36:07,512 --> 01:36:10,640
I'll be glad to walk it with you, if ever,

1336
01:36:10,932 --> 01:36:14,644
that would be no small
miracle, Mrs. Davenport.

1337
01:36:16,229 --> 01:36:18,147
To choose and to cherish

1338
01:36:19,274 --> 01:36:22,193
the love who made me for Himself.

1339
01:36:22,485 --> 01:36:23,695
Not to pass,

1340
01:36:23,987 --> 01:36:26,489
but to be in Him in love forever.

1341
01:36:31,619 --> 01:36:33,454
Late have I loved thee.

1342
01:36:37,917 --> 01:36:40,920
It's what we all say in the end.

1343
01:36:41,212 --> 01:36:43,256
(chuckles)

1344
01:36:43,548 --> 01:36:45,216
(crying)

1345
01:36:56,936 --> 01:36:57,936
- Thank you.

1346
01:37:23,838 --> 01:37:27,342
(dramatic orchestral music)

1347
01:37:46,402 --> 01:37:47,612
- [Daniel] Marie!

1348
01:37:49,697 --> 01:37:50,697
Marie!

1349
01:38:02,877 --> 01:38:03,877
- Oh.

1350
01:38:05,630 --> 01:38:09,384
(dramatic orchestral music)

1351
01:38:26,734 --> 01:38:30,154
(light orchestral music)

1352
01:42:19,675 --> 01:42:22,094
(lion roaring)
