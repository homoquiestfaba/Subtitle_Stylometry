1
00:00:33,717 --> 00:00:37,653
<i>I'd like to think that fate had a hand</i>
<i>in what happened that summer.</i>

2
00:00:37,821 --> 00:00:41,086
<i>That it was the pants' destiny</i>
<i>to find us.</i>

3
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:44,852
<i>Where they came from</i>
<i>and why they chose us...</i>

4
00:00:45,028 --> 00:00:48,486
<i>...well, that will always be a mystery.</i>

5
00:00:48,765 --> 00:00:51,290
<i>But perhaps that was part</i>
<i>of their miracle.</i>

6
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:54,869
<i>That they sensed in that moment</i>
<i>how much we needed them.</i>

7
00:00:55,038 --> 00:00:59,805
<i>How much we needed</i>
<i>some little bit of faith to hold onto...</i>

8
00:00:59,976 --> 00:01:04,777
<i>...when it seemed like everything</i>
<i>we believed in was about to slip away.</i>

9
00:01:15,258 --> 00:01:17,783
<i>But wait a minute,</i>
<i>I'm getting ahead of myself.</i>

10
00:01:18,261 --> 00:01:19,489
Beautiful dress! Love it.

11
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:22,062
<i>We'd been a foursome</i>
<i>for as long as I could remember.</i>

12
00:01:22,232 --> 00:01:24,666
-Where are we going?
-We're going over there.

13
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:27,826
<i>In fact, we were a foursome</i>
<i>before we were born.</i>

14
00:01:28,004 --> 00:01:30,734
And seven. Anyone feel any kicking?

15
00:01:30,907 --> 00:01:33,637
<i>Our mothers met</i>
<i>at a prenatal aerobics class.</i>

16
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:36,506
<i>They really didn't have</i>
<i>anything in common...</i>

17
00:01:36,746 --> 00:01:39,180
<i>...except their due dates.</i>

18
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:42,284
One, and relax. Good work.

19
00:01:42,452 --> 00:01:45,546
<i>The first one out of the gate was Bridget.</i>

20
00:01:46,422 --> 00:01:48,549
Ladies, let's keep it together.

21
00:01:48,725 --> 00:01:50,590
<i>The rest of us followed within the week.</i>

22
00:01:52,061 --> 00:01:53,653
<i>Bridget liked to take charge.</i>

23
00:01:55,498 --> 00:01:56,829
Way to go, Lena.

24
00:01:57,433 --> 00:01:58,661
l'll handle this.

25
00:01:59,135 --> 00:02:00,659
<i>And you know what?</i>

26
00:02:00,837 --> 00:02:04,238
<i>Sometimes, that worked in our favor.</i>

27
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:06,732
Oh, my God.

28
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,908
<i>And that's how it always was with us:</i>

29
00:02:13,283 --> 00:02:15,547
<i>Give and take.</i>

30
00:02:17,253 --> 00:02:18,948
<i>But mostly give.</i>

31
00:02:21,457 --> 00:02:25,154
Lena, l don't think
he's coming back this time.

32
00:02:25,328 --> 00:02:26,989
<i>It's gonna be okay, Carmen.</i>

33
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:30,161
l'll come over first thing tomorrow.

34
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,459
<i>And Tibby and Bridget too.</i>

35
00:02:33,369 --> 00:02:36,236
Just stay on the phone with me
until you fall asleep.

36
00:02:38,675 --> 00:02:41,542
<i>What Were They Thinking?,</i> take seven.

37
00:02:41,945 --> 00:02:43,378
<i>We were there for each other...</i>

38
00:02:43,546 --> 00:02:46,481
<i>...to understand the things</i>
<i>that no one else in the world could.</i>

39
00:02:46,649 --> 00:02:49,880
What were they thinking,
having another baby at their age?

40
00:02:50,053 --> 00:02:51,281
And what was l?

41
00:02:51,454 --> 00:02:53,547
Just some experiment
from their hippie days...

42
00:02:53,723 --> 00:02:56,487
...and now it's time
to start their real family?

43
00:02:56,693 --> 00:02:57,990
Go ahead.

44
00:02:58,862 --> 00:03:00,887
They're out of their minds.

45
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:03,030
lt sucks.

46
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,463
-Totally.
-Cut!

47
00:03:05,635 --> 00:03:07,762
Lena, don't you realize this is tragedy?

48
00:03:07,937 --> 00:03:10,337
Can't you give me
a bit more enthusiasm?

49
00:03:11,341 --> 00:03:14,242
<i>There were some things</i>
<i>we would never make sense of.</i>

50
00:03:14,744 --> 00:03:17,406
Grief is never an easy burden to bear.

51
00:03:17,647 --> 00:03:19,512
<i>And we were there for those too.</i>

52
00:03:19,749 --> 00:03:24,618
And as we mourn the loss
of this beloved wife, mother and friend...

53
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:28,382
...it only makes her choice
that much more unfathomable.

54
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:33,494
What measure of despair compels
one to commit such an act?

55
00:03:33,663 --> 00:03:37,497
We can only take comfort in the fact
that she is in a better place now...

56
00:03:37,667 --> 00:03:39,396
...than she found here among us.

57
00:03:45,675 --> 00:03:47,700
My deepest sympathies. Bridget.

58
00:03:47,877 --> 00:03:51,244
<i>We were there for the things</i>
<i>we couldn't face alone.</i>

59
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:56,677
-Hey.
-Hey, Bee, you okay?

60
00:03:56,853 --> 00:03:59,879
Yeah. l will be as soon as l get out
of these stupid heels.

61
00:04:00,056 --> 00:04:02,820
Here. Hold them for me, will you?

62
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:04,960
Think l'll run home.

63
00:04:05,228 --> 00:04:09,164
<i>Or the ones we didn't</i>
<i>want to face at all.</i>

64
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:17,136
<i>Together, it was as if we formed</i>
<i>one single, complete person.</i>

65
00:04:17,307 --> 00:04:19,605
<i>Wild, unstoppable Bridget.</i>

66
00:04:19,776 --> 00:04:21,971
<i>Shy and beautiful Lena.</i>

67
00:04:22,145 --> 00:04:23,612
<i>Tibby, the rebel.</i>

68
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:26,408
<i>And me, Carmen, the writer.</i>

69
00:04:26,582 --> 00:04:28,482
Can't buy anything new
at a vintage store.

70
00:04:28,651 --> 00:04:32,747
<i>We were 1 6 and had never been apart.</i>
<i>And all that was about to change.</i>

71
00:04:32,922 --> 00:04:34,480
-How about this one?
-lt's great.

72
00:04:34,657 --> 00:04:37,217
lf you wanna go to Greece
looking like Laverne De Fazio.

73
00:04:37,393 --> 00:04:38,826
-Who?
-'70s TV icon.

74
00:04:38,995 --> 00:04:41,190
Am l the only one who's
not culturally deprived?

75
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:43,628
Tibby forgot to take
her happy pill this morning.

76
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,065
Actually, l'm saving them for when
l'm stuck doing time at Wallmans...

77
00:04:47,236 --> 00:04:49,932
...while the rest of you jet off
on your little adventures.

78
00:04:50,106 --> 00:04:53,098
Boo-hoo, Tibby.
You are such a drama queen.

79
00:04:53,276 --> 00:04:56,734
l am going to South Carolina.
That is only, like, three states away.

80
00:04:56,913 --> 00:04:59,643
lt's abandonment, nevertheless.
l hate you all.

81
00:04:59,816 --> 00:05:02,216
You're the one who wanted
to stay here all summer...

82
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:04,376
...and angst it out
making your documentary.

83
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:06,283
Yeah, it's gonna be a huge hit.

84
00:05:06,456 --> 00:05:09,050
Thrilling footage on
how to stack deodorant.

85
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:12,717
l think l'm gonna start my own genre,
call it the ''suckumentary.''

86
00:05:12,929 --> 00:05:15,090
Lena, look at this! Oh, my goodness.

87
00:05:15,264 --> 00:05:17,425
-They're perfect.
-l can't wear a bikini.

88
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,864
Don't you know all the beaches
in Greece are nude?

89
00:05:20,036 --> 00:05:22,527
-What?
-She's just kidding, Lena.

90
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:24,438
God, l envy you.

91
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:27,007
You get to go to a place
where there's actually guys.

92
00:05:27,176 --> 00:05:29,770
l thought you were looking forward
to <i>El Campo de Futbol.</i>

93
00:05:29,946 --> 00:05:32,506
She sure was until she found out
it was girls only.

94
00:05:32,682 --> 00:05:34,582
-No boys allowed.
-Don't talk about it.

95
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:37,151
Hey, pierce alert, pierce alert.

96
00:05:37,653 --> 00:05:40,121
Sorry, young lady, no more holes.

97
00:05:40,289 --> 00:05:42,223
Take those out right now
and try these on.

98
00:05:42,392 --> 00:05:43,916
-Look. Here you go.
-Put them on.

99
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:46,755
-Go, go, go.
-Okay, Carmen-- Carmen.

100
00:05:48,364 --> 00:05:50,764
Tibby, you're a babe!

101
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:53,731
Tibby, you look amazing.
Turn around. Look at you!

102
00:05:53,903 --> 00:05:56,303
-Carmen!
-You look wonderful.

103
00:05:56,472 --> 00:05:59,202
-lt looks good.
-lt looked great on you. Please buy them.

104
00:05:59,709 --> 00:06:02,405
-You try them on, then.
-But l don't wear jeans.

105
00:06:02,578 --> 00:06:04,170
Yeah. Or bikinis or miniskirts...

106
00:06:04,347 --> 00:06:07,180
...or anything else that might actually
show you have a shape.

107
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:08,339
l do not.

108
00:06:08,518 --> 00:06:12,010
Tibby, those look so great on you.
Why can't you just admit it?

109
00:06:12,388 --> 00:06:14,549
Because l'm wallowing in self-pity.

110
00:06:19,028 --> 00:06:20,222
-Lena!
-Are you serious?

111
00:06:20,396 --> 00:06:21,829
-You have a body!
-Look at that.

112
00:06:21,998 --> 00:06:24,831
Lena Kaligaris has a body!

113
00:06:25,001 --> 00:06:27,196
-Stop it! l do not.
-When did this happen?

114
00:06:27,403 --> 00:06:29,268
-You look good in them.
-Look at you.

115
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:32,733
You look good! Little Lena.

116
00:06:32,909 --> 00:06:36,003
You're the one who loves jeans so much,
why don't you try them?

117
00:06:36,179 --> 00:06:39,273
-Maybe because l'm 3 inches taller than you.
-Fair's fair.

118
00:06:39,449 --> 00:06:42,543
-Hey, how can they be perfect on you too?
-That is a little weird.

119
00:06:42,718 --> 00:06:45,414
l don't know, but it's really starting
to freak me out.

120
00:06:45,588 --> 00:06:47,488
Okay, Carmen, it's your turn.

121
00:06:48,891 --> 00:06:51,155
Carmen, you try them on.

122
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:54,160
-Oh, come on, honestly. Are you serious?
-You have to.

123
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:59,324
You think that a pair of jeans that fits
all three of you is going to fit all of this?

124
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:02,096
-Put them on. Now.
-We'll help your thighs get into them.

125
00:07:02,271 --> 00:07:04,501
-Tibby! Come on, now.
-l'm just kidding.

126
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:06,642
Will you help me get out of them?

127
00:07:06,809 --> 00:07:09,903
Carmen, we all tried them on.
Just try them.

128
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,376
All right.

129
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:15,608
My thighs.

130
00:07:16,452 --> 00:07:17,919
Sassy britches.

131
00:07:19,155 --> 00:07:20,884
Get over these thighs.

132
00:07:21,591 --> 00:07:23,616
Okay, here we go.

133
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:30,624
What? l told you guys.
l'm just gonna take them off...

134
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,200
...and we're gonna pretend
like this never happened.

135
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:35,530
No, Carmen, come over here
and look at yourself.

136
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:37,900
-They look amazing on you.
-Look at them.

137
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:42,102
Call me crazy, but it's
scientifically impossible...

138
00:07:42,278 --> 00:07:45,111
-...that a pair of pants could fit me....
-And me.

139
00:07:45,314 --> 00:07:47,839
-And me.
-And me.

140
00:07:48,151 --> 00:07:49,209
This is crazy.

141
00:07:49,385 --> 00:07:53,583
Look, Tib, something happened today
that l can't explain and you can't explain.

142
00:07:53,756 --> 00:07:56,418
-Whatever, let's just ignore it.
-We can't just ignore it.

143
00:07:56,592 --> 00:07:58,355
-Why?
-Because it's a sign, the pants--

144
00:07:58,528 --> 00:08:00,723
-Be quiet, you're gonna--
-You know what, Tibby?

145
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:02,922
-Sometimes you're much too much.
-Be careful.

146
00:08:03,099 --> 00:08:05,260
-l'm fine, Lena.
-Oh, my God. You're gonna fall.

147
00:08:05,434 --> 00:08:08,096
lt makes our butts look good.
That's enough for me.

148
00:08:08,271 --> 00:08:11,172
-That's right, amen.
-Get up there. Go on.

149
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:14,366
-There is more going here than Lycra.
-But there's probably Lycra.

150
00:08:24,654 --> 00:08:26,747
All right, guys, are you ready for this?

151
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:28,652
ln the name of the Father, the Son--

152
00:08:28,824 --> 00:08:30,621
-Here we go.
-Carmen, this isn't church.

153
00:08:30,793 --> 00:08:33,728
You guys! But it's still a sacred place!

154
00:08:33,896 --> 00:08:36,990
l mean, this is where
our moms met, right?

155
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:39,464
Anyway, look,
we're gathered here today...

156
00:08:39,635 --> 00:08:41,694
...to honor a gift
that has been sent to us.

157
00:08:41,871 --> 00:08:43,862
-So why do we have to pay for them?
-Tibs.

158
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:46,474
Carmen, go ahead,
just finish what you have to say.

159
00:08:46,642 --> 00:08:49,236
Tonight, on the eve of our separation...

160
00:08:49,412 --> 00:08:52,313
...magic has come to us
in a pair of pants.

161
00:08:55,985 --> 00:09:00,046
And l'm proposing
that we share them equally...

162
00:09:00,223 --> 00:09:03,249
...and that this summer
they travel among us...

163
00:09:03,426 --> 00:09:05,690
...and they'll link us
in hearts and spirits...

164
00:09:05,861 --> 00:09:08,022
...even though we're far apart
from each other.

165
00:09:08,564 --> 00:09:12,056
l think that tonight we're
the sisters of these <i>pantalones.</i>

166
00:09:12,235 --> 00:09:13,793
-Sisters of the Pants?
-Yes!

167
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,995
We need rules.
Every sisterhood has rules.

168
00:09:16,172 --> 00:09:17,799
Thank you. A manifesto.

169
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:19,737
-Okay.
-Good point. l love it.

170
00:09:19,909 --> 00:09:21,570
Okay, rule number one:

171
00:09:21,744 --> 00:09:23,837
Each sister is going
to keep the pants for...?

172
00:09:24,013 --> 00:09:25,037
-<i>A week.</i>
-<i>A week.</i>

173
00:09:25,214 --> 00:09:27,808
<i>Lena should be first</i>
<i>because Greece is the furthest away.</i>

174
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:29,315
-<i>Okay.</i>
-<i>Tibby, you next.</i>

175
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:31,510
-What's your rule?
-l don't have a rule.

176
00:09:31,687 --> 00:09:33,314
-Yes, you do.
-Tibs, come on.

177
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:35,480
No picking your nose
when wearing the pants.

178
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:36,647
-Honestly.
-That's not--

179
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:41,229
You can casually scratch
while really picking a little.

180
00:09:41,397 --> 00:09:43,297
-Thanks for the allowance.
-Good rule.

181
00:09:43,466 --> 00:09:45,593
<i>When sending the pants,</i>
<i>we'll write a letter...</i>

182
00:09:45,768 --> 00:09:48,965
<i>...detailing the most exciting thing</i>
<i>that happened while wearing them.</i>

183
00:09:49,138 --> 00:09:50,127
<i>That's good.</i>

184
00:09:50,306 --> 00:09:52,274
<i>So most exciting thing</i>
<i>that happens to you.</i>

185
00:09:52,441 --> 00:09:54,602
<i>And what if nothing exciting happens?</i>

186
00:09:54,777 --> 00:09:57,439
-<i>It will. It has to!</i>
-<i>No, I really doubt it.</i>

187
00:09:57,613 --> 00:09:59,672
And when it happens, and we reunite...

188
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:02,079
...we will document it
on the pants themselves.

189
00:10:02,251 --> 00:10:04,276
-That's good.
-That's rule number six.

190
00:10:04,453 --> 00:10:05,715
Rule number seven:

191
00:10:05,888 --> 00:10:10,120
Any removal of the pants
must be done by the wearer herself.

192
00:10:11,127 --> 00:10:12,526
Yes, you.

193
00:10:13,896 --> 00:10:15,124
Touché!

194
00:10:15,298 --> 00:10:16,595
He works, you know.

195
00:10:16,766 --> 00:10:19,394
So he may not have that much time
to spend with you.

196
00:10:19,568 --> 00:10:21,627
So if you get lonely,
come home, okay?

197
00:10:21,804 --> 00:10:23,897
l'm gonna be fine, Mom.

198
00:10:24,073 --> 00:10:26,667
We will never, ever
wash these pants.

199
00:10:26,842 --> 00:10:29,333
Carmen, that's so unnecessary.
Why not?

200
00:10:29,512 --> 00:10:31,377
Because you can't wash the pants.

201
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:32,912
-Why? Why?
-Carmen, we have to.

202
00:10:33,082 --> 00:10:35,482
What? Are you gonna wash
the magic out of the pants?

203
00:10:35,651 --> 00:10:36,743
The magic's not sanitary.

204
00:10:36,919 --> 00:10:39,012
No, l have a better one.
No double cuffing.

205
00:10:39,188 --> 00:10:41,782
<i>Double-cuffing the pants</i>
<i>at the bottom, it's tacky.</i>

206
00:10:41,957 --> 00:10:44,187
-<i>The '80s are over.</i>
-<i>You know what else is tacky?</i>

207
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:47,488
Tucking in your shirt
and wearing a belt at the same time.

208
00:10:47,663 --> 00:10:49,528
-l don't do that anymore.
-Good one.

209
00:10:49,699 --> 00:10:51,826
l did that one time.

210
00:10:52,001 --> 00:10:53,992
-Forbidden to cuff or tuck.
-Okay, okay.

211
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:56,161
-<i>No cuffing or tucking.</i>
-<i>My turn, my turn.</i>

212
00:10:58,007 --> 00:10:59,235
-Okay.
-Yes, Bee?

213
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:02,002
You can never say you look fat
while wearing the pants.

214
00:11:02,178 --> 00:11:03,975
You can't even think it!

215
00:11:04,146 --> 00:11:06,774
<i>All passengers,</i>
<i>this is the final boarding call</i>--

216
00:11:06,949 --> 00:11:09,679
Take care,
and be sure to write, huh?

217
00:11:09,852 --> 00:11:12,753
You too. Bye.

218
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:15,789
You better get going.
Looks like they're starting to board.

219
00:11:19,128 --> 00:11:20,720
-That's nine.
-So we need one more.

220
00:11:20,896 --> 00:11:23,126
-We need a final rule.
-Final rule.

221
00:11:23,299 --> 00:11:26,700
Okay, pants equal love.

222
00:11:26,969 --> 00:11:30,097
Love your sisters and love yourself.

223
00:11:42,985 --> 00:11:44,418
To the pants.

224
00:11:44,587 --> 00:11:46,555
And the sisterhood.

225
00:11:46,722 --> 00:11:48,246
And this summer...

226
00:11:48,691 --> 00:11:50,591
...and the rest of our lives.

227
00:11:51,026 --> 00:11:53,790
Together and apart.

228
00:12:19,355 --> 00:12:23,451
You know, Papou,
l really wouldn't mind walking.

229
00:12:25,227 --> 00:12:29,664
l'm sorry that my Greek isn't so good.

230
00:12:30,766 --> 00:12:32,825
Mom said that l'd pick it up in no time.

231
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:37,803
You know, with all the talking,
just with you and with Yia Yia.

232
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:34,958
Lena!

233
00:13:42,638 --> 00:13:44,071
Lena!

234
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:47,607
lt's the evil eye.

235
00:13:47,776 --> 00:13:52,338
Lena. l think l'll die
and never see my Lena.

236
00:13:52,515 --> 00:13:56,747
l think l'll never see you, my Lena.

237
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:04,085
You like your room? And your bed?

238
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:07,229
l have put the most special
sheets and lace.

239
00:14:07,396 --> 00:14:11,696
And from this window,
the most beautiful view.

240
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:18,536
She's precious. Like a jewel.

241
00:14:18,974 --> 00:14:21,340
We guard you like a jewel.

242
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,941
You need rest.

243
00:15:23,138 --> 00:15:25,902
When you hear your name called
and the color of your team...

244
00:15:26,075 --> 00:15:27,906
...run over and join your coach.

245
00:15:28,077 --> 00:15:30,944
-All right.
-Alma, Megan, green.

246
00:15:31,113 --> 00:15:33,172
Anderson, Alice, green.

247
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:35,180
Adissa, Jessica, red.

248
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:37,876
Bo, Natalie, red.

249
00:15:39,989 --> 00:15:41,422
Come on, come on, <i>rapido!</i>

250
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:44,184
Please, God, let me sprain
my ankle as soon as possible.

251
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,418
Come again?

252
00:15:45,594 --> 00:15:48,995
This whole thing was my mother's idea.
She couldn't wait to get rid of me.

253
00:15:49,164 --> 00:15:52,429
God, mine has been sobbing all week,
''What am l gonna do without you?''

254
00:15:52,601 --> 00:15:54,364
l'm like, ''Get a life, Ma,'' you know?

255
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:56,470
What's yours do?

256
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:57,970
Nothing.

257
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:01,475
Hey, who's that?

258
00:16:02,144 --> 00:16:06,205
Don't even think about it. lt's against
the rules to have flings with the coaches.

259
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:08,441
Marsden, Olivia, red.

260
00:16:10,152 --> 00:16:11,779
Come on!

261
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:15,019
Vreeland, Bridget, red.

262
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:51,020
Hey, baby.

263
00:16:57,566 --> 00:17:00,228
Here it is. l asked the school
to postpone sending this...

264
00:17:00,402 --> 00:17:03,337
...because, Dad,
l wanted to surprise you.

265
00:17:03,505 --> 00:17:06,269
-Ta-da! Straight A's.
-That's fantastic.

266
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:09,639
Dad, l brought my tennis gear
and l have been practicing like crazy...

267
00:17:09,812 --> 00:17:12,781
-...so serve to me your absolute hardest.
-l'll do that.

268
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:15,746
You know, l was calculating it
on the train.

269
00:17:15,918 --> 00:17:19,547
l haven't spent more than four
straight days with you since l was 1 0.

270
00:17:19,722 --> 00:17:21,917
l mean, l love it when
you come for Christmas...

271
00:17:22,091 --> 00:17:24,252
...but a whole summer
and just the two of us?

272
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:27,426
Mom taught me
how to make <i>arroz con pollo.</i>

273
00:17:27,596 --> 00:17:30,759
l'm gonna cook that for you.
And <i>platanos</i> too.

274
00:17:30,933 --> 00:17:32,662
Wait, where are we?

275
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:36,637
l have a surprise for you.

276
00:17:38,407 --> 00:17:39,897
l moved out of Charleston.

277
00:17:40,075 --> 00:17:44,307
And into a development?
Dad, you hate developments.

278
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,811
When did l say that?

279
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:48,711
At the Frederick Law Olmstead
exhibit at the Smithsonian.

280
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:54,315
You said, ''There's city and there's country,
and everything else is a wasteland.''

281
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:58,221
l was 9 years old. You came to D.C. for
one day to visit with a plastics company.

282
00:17:58,393 --> 00:18:00,122
You remember everything!

283
00:18:00,295 --> 00:18:02,991
l don't remember
you telling me you moved.

284
00:18:08,237 --> 00:18:09,727
Who is that?

285
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:12,136
ls that your neighbor?

286
00:18:12,307 --> 00:18:14,571
Actually, we live together.

287
00:18:18,614 --> 00:18:20,241
Hey!

288
00:18:23,318 --> 00:18:27,311
You must be Carmen.

289
00:18:30,826 --> 00:18:33,420
Your daddy has told me
so much about you.

290
00:18:33,595 --> 00:18:36,792
l just know we're gonna have
the most wonderful summer together.

291
00:18:36,965 --> 00:18:39,490
-Kids! Kids, come on out here!
-Kids?

292
00:18:39,668 --> 00:18:42,193
They're not kids,
they're teenagers, just like you.

293
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:43,929
They live with you?

294
00:18:44,406 --> 00:18:48,001
Carmen, this is Krista and this is Paul.

295
00:18:48,177 --> 00:18:50,839
-We're gonna be bridesmaids together.
-Excuse me?

296
00:18:51,013 --> 00:18:54,540
l hadn't quite gotten
to that part of the surprise yet.

297
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:57,617
Oh, sweetheart....

298
00:18:58,821 --> 00:19:00,789
We're getting married.

299
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:03,415
August 1 9th.

300
00:19:13,869 --> 00:19:16,099
Say, you're a real natural with that thing.

301
00:19:16,271 --> 00:19:18,637
Took me weeks
before l got the hang of it.

302
00:19:18,807 --> 00:19:21,105
Yeah, well, we all have
our special talents.

303
00:19:21,276 --> 00:19:23,836
Tibby! l thought
l made it perfectly clear...

304
00:19:24,012 --> 00:19:27,448
...that employee headsets
are to be worn at all times.

305
00:19:27,616 --> 00:19:30,016
Don't make me mention it again.

306
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,049
Excuse me?

307
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:35,947
Where are the shampoos?

308
00:19:37,459 --> 00:19:39,324
Aisle seven.

309
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:09,284
Somebody help!

310
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,085
Girl down.

311
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:13,194
Somebody call an ambulance!

312
00:20:29,244 --> 00:20:31,474
You've got a price sticker
on your forehead.

313
00:21:57,933 --> 00:21:59,560
l'm sorry...

314
00:22:00,268 --> 00:22:02,031
...l don't speak Greek very well.

315
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:05,805
Well, we'll have to work
on that, won't we?

316
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:14,146
Thanks for lending me a shirt.

317
00:22:15,317 --> 00:22:16,750
Looks good on you.

318
00:22:18,887 --> 00:22:21,151
Sorry if it smells like fish.

319
00:22:23,692 --> 00:22:26,923
-ls this your boat?
-My grandfather's.

320
00:22:27,095 --> 00:22:29,620
Yeah. All the ones
with the blue flags are his.

321
00:22:29,798 --> 00:22:32,494
-Do you work for him?
-No, just in the summer.

322
00:22:32,734 --> 00:22:35,464
l go to the university in Athens.

323
00:22:38,907 --> 00:22:40,340
Kostas Dounas.

324
00:22:40,642 --> 00:22:41,870
Lena Kaligaris.

325
00:22:42,044 --> 00:22:44,103
Lena Kaligaris.
Then you are Greek too, eh?

326
00:22:45,547 --> 00:22:48,880
So how do you know English so well?

327
00:22:49,217 --> 00:22:52,880
Well, l lived with my parents
in Chicago until l was 1 2.

328
00:22:53,088 --> 00:22:54,953
Oh, my parents moved to the U.S. too.

329
00:22:56,191 --> 00:22:59,752
But l'm just here for the summer.
l'm staying with my grandparents.

330
00:23:00,996 --> 00:23:03,521
l have to throw the small ones back.

331
00:23:03,732 --> 00:23:05,461
Would you like to help?

332
00:23:07,035 --> 00:23:09,629
No. That's okay.

333
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:11,067
Okay, here, l'll show you.

334
00:23:13,341 --> 00:23:14,740
Give me your hand.

335
00:23:15,877 --> 00:23:17,538
Put your hand on my hand.

336
00:23:17,879 --> 00:23:19,107
Put your hand close.

337
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:22,749
Good?

338
00:23:27,189 --> 00:23:29,453
Luck was on his side today.

339
00:23:35,697 --> 00:23:38,530
l have to go. l should go.

340
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:43,000
But thank you again
for saving my life.

341
00:23:45,941 --> 00:23:48,205
Do you dance better than you swim?

342
00:23:49,744 --> 00:23:53,145
-Excuse me?
-Saturday night. Meet me.

343
00:23:54,216 --> 00:23:57,777
l'm sorry. l can't.

344
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:09,754
Pick it up!

345
00:24:22,777 --> 00:24:24,335
Hi.

346
00:24:24,513 --> 00:24:26,378
-Hi.
-l'm Bridget.

347
00:24:27,682 --> 00:24:30,173
-Eric.
-l know.

348
00:24:30,652 --> 00:24:33,314
So l hear you go to Columbia.

349
00:24:34,856 --> 00:24:36,346
Yep.

350
00:24:37,692 --> 00:24:39,819
Well, what have you heard about me?

351
00:24:40,028 --> 00:24:42,724
Your high school won Nationals.

352
00:24:42,998 --> 00:24:45,523
MVP. l play forward.

353
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,827
So l've noticed.

354
00:24:49,371 --> 00:24:50,861
l'm 1 7.

355
00:24:52,674 --> 00:24:54,403
Come on, l'll race you.

356
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:17,154
That's it.

357
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:19,927
Seven miles.

358
00:25:20,402 --> 00:25:22,768
Oh, God, don't you love to run?

359
00:25:23,205 --> 00:25:24,433
Yeah.

360
00:25:25,473 --> 00:25:26,872
lt's the best high there is.

361
00:25:27,542 --> 00:25:28,770
Exactly, it's--

362
00:25:28,977 --> 00:25:33,437
lt's like you're just in this place where
nothing bad could ever happen, you know?

363
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:36,880
Like if you just push a bit further,
if you just keep moving--

364
00:25:37,052 --> 00:25:39,282
Nothing can touch you.

365
00:25:41,223 --> 00:25:43,691
Of course, the endorphins
don't suck, either.

366
00:25:49,397 --> 00:25:51,194
-So Tami's feeling okay?
-Yeah.

367
00:25:51,366 --> 00:25:53,197
ls she gonna do
baton twirling with you?

368
00:25:53,368 --> 00:25:56,201
We don't know yet.
She might just have to hold the banner.

369
00:25:56,371 --> 00:25:59,966
Sweetheart, why don't we say grace
before we start eating dinner?

370
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:01,438
-l would love to.
-All right.

371
00:26:04,713 --> 00:26:08,308
Bless us, O Lord, for these,
thy gifts which we are about to receive...

372
00:26:08,483 --> 00:26:10,883
...from Thy bounty,
through Christ, our Lord.

373
00:26:11,052 --> 00:26:14,249
-Amen. Dig in.
-This looks great.

374
00:26:14,422 --> 00:26:16,413
-l will get that.
-Oh, it's okay.

375
00:26:16,591 --> 00:26:18,388
We don't answer the phone
during dinner.

376
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:21,552
Except that one time.
Tell us again how you guys met.

377
00:26:23,131 --> 00:26:24,564
We've told that story so many--

378
00:26:24,733 --> 00:26:26,030
-You wanna tell it?
-l don't.

379
00:26:26,201 --> 00:26:27,498
-Want me to?
-All right.

380
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:29,796
-l dialed the wrong number.
-And l answered.

381
00:26:29,971 --> 00:26:31,734
-Lydia answered.
-During dinner.

382
00:26:31,906 --> 00:26:33,430
Just that one time.

383
00:26:33,608 --> 00:26:36,577
And Lydia agreed
to go out with a stranger.

384
00:26:36,745 --> 00:26:39,612
-ls that not what happened?
-Oh, no, come on. No, l did not.

385
00:26:39,781 --> 00:26:43,012
-That is exactly what happened!
-We went bowling. lt was so much fun.

386
00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:46,210
-Do you remember you bowled a two?
-A two is a bad score.

387
00:26:46,388 --> 00:26:48,618
At least l didn't get the ball
stuck on my thumb.

388
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:50,655
The water in the toilet is blue.

389
00:26:50,825 --> 00:26:52,850
-<i>Blue?</i>
-Yes, Mom, blue.

390
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:54,962
And by the way,
doesn't Dad hate bowling?

391
00:26:55,130 --> 00:26:57,098
-Bowling?
-<i>Well</i>, <i>he's down here bowling</i>.

392
00:26:57,265 --> 00:27:00,098
-And he says grace.
-Grace?

393
00:27:00,268 --> 00:27:02,930
He says grace, Mom.
He gives thanks to God before he eats.

394
00:27:03,104 --> 00:27:06,437
We couldn't get him to go to church
with us once. Who is this guy?

395
00:27:06,608 --> 00:27:08,838
-<i>I don't even</i>--
-You need to talk to him, Carmen.

396
00:27:09,010 --> 00:27:13,208
-Just tell him how you feel.
-l do talk to him. l talk to him all the time.

397
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:15,212
Yeah, like you talk to me? No.

398
00:27:15,917 --> 00:27:18,715
<i>This is important, Carmencita.</i>
<i>What he did was wrong.</i>

399
00:27:19,254 --> 00:27:22,121
l'm gonna get on a plane
and l'm just gonna come down there.

400
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:25,487
Look, you'd never want him to be happy,
and that's why you blame him.

401
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:29,756
And this is gonna work out great.
lt's going to be fine.

402
00:27:40,809 --> 00:27:42,242
<i>Dear Tibby...</i>

403
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:47,609
<i>...I think we may have been very,</i>
<i>very wrong about the pants.</i>

404
00:27:47,782 --> 00:27:50,808
<i>The one time I wore them</i>
<i>I almost drowned...</i>

405
00:27:50,985 --> 00:27:53,351
<i>...and then got plucked</i>
<i>onto a fishing boat...</i>

406
00:27:53,521 --> 00:27:57,355
<i>...by a guy who made me touch</i>
<i>a live fish. It was disgusting!</i>

407
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:01,554
<i>At least I'm getting some</i>
<i>good sketching in.</i>

408
00:28:02,731 --> 00:28:04,665
<i>I love everything about this island.</i>

409
00:28:05,667 --> 00:28:07,601
<i>Oh, except that you're not with me.</i>

410
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:13,268
<i>Infinite X's and O's, Lena.</i>

411
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:31,281
-How was town?
-Fine.

412
00:28:31,459 --> 00:28:33,950
l have found this in the laundry.

413
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:35,721
ls it yours?

414
00:28:35,897 --> 00:28:37,694
No, actually...

415
00:28:39,501 --> 00:28:41,401
...l sort of borrowed it.

416
00:28:41,569 --> 00:28:44,504
When l went down to the harbor,
l went swimming...

417
00:28:44,706 --> 00:28:46,799
...and someone just lent it to me.

418
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:48,966
Oh, someone. Someone who?

419
00:28:49,177 --> 00:28:50,576
A boy?

420
00:28:50,745 --> 00:28:52,610
Which one? l know everyone.

421
00:28:56,618 --> 00:28:58,745
Don't mind them, they're your cousins.

422
00:29:01,589 --> 00:29:03,580
They're cousins too?
How many do l have?

423
00:29:03,758 --> 00:29:08,422
Plenty of them.
Don't change the subject.

424
00:29:08,930 --> 00:29:11,558
Out with it. Out, out.

425
00:29:11,733 --> 00:29:15,100
His name is Kostas Dounas.

426
00:29:17,272 --> 00:29:18,500
Dounas?

427
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:21,908
He's a Dounas?

428
00:29:24,212 --> 00:29:26,180
You must never speak of them.

429
00:29:26,347 --> 00:29:29,942
They are liars! They are thieves!
They are barbarians!

430
00:29:38,793 --> 00:29:42,923
Your grandfather would die
if he know about this.

431
00:29:43,932 --> 00:29:46,992
You must never see this boy again.

432
00:29:47,368 --> 00:29:49,097
You understand?

433
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:52,168
-Yes.
-No, that's not enough.

434
00:29:53,675 --> 00:29:55,802
You have to swear.

435
00:29:55,977 --> 00:29:57,808
l swear.

436
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:01,481
Okay.

437
00:30:48,897 --> 00:30:50,762
<i>What am I supposed to be saying here?</i>

438
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:52,695
<i>Oh, just, stuff about your life.</i>

439
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:54,834
<i>Well, there ain't nothing</i>
<i>too interesting.</i>

440
00:30:55,003 --> 00:30:58,063
<i>We're not really looking for interesting.</i>
<i>It's just real, you know.</i>

441
00:30:58,239 --> 00:31:00,969
-<i>That's the point of a documentary.</i>
-<i>A what?</i>

442
00:31:01,576 --> 00:31:03,635
<i>A documentary.</i>

443
00:31:04,879 --> 00:31:06,904
<i>Like a movie, only boring.</i>

444
00:31:15,757 --> 00:31:19,124
Hi, l think this is yours.
They delivered it to my house by mistake.

445
00:31:19,594 --> 00:31:21,391
They must've got
the numbers screwed up.

446
00:31:21,563 --> 00:31:24,498
See, this says 721 and l'm 27 1 .
l'm Bailey Graffman.

447
00:31:24,666 --> 00:31:27,226
Yeah, you're the one that fainted
the other day, right?

448
00:31:27,402 --> 00:31:30,303
-At Wallmans. l was there.
-Oh, yeah.

449
00:31:30,805 --> 00:31:34,263
You're the weird girl
with the price sticker on your forehead.

450
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:37,175
Wait here, l got something for you.

451
00:31:50,658 --> 00:31:53,593
lt was lying next to you.
l opened it to see if there was an lD.

452
00:31:53,761 --> 00:31:55,695
So you ripped off my wallet?

453
00:31:56,130 --> 00:31:59,429
That's kind of like a thank you
but different.

454
00:32:01,269 --> 00:32:03,237
l think l had more than $4 in here.

455
00:32:04,105 --> 00:32:07,541
Do you seriously think
l would steal your money?

456
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:10,307
l opened it to see
if there was an lD in there.

457
00:32:10,545 --> 00:32:14,242
Okay? There wasn't. There was a school
photo and a pathetic picture of a kitten.

458
00:32:14,415 --> 00:32:15,746
So, what's in yours?

459
00:32:15,917 --> 00:32:18,681
A Wallmans' employee card
or a license to ride a bike?

460
00:32:18,853 --> 00:32:21,515
Excuse me, l get my learner's permit
next week and--

461
00:32:21,689 --> 00:32:22,951
How old are you, like 1 0?

462
00:32:23,124 --> 00:32:24,716
-Twelve.
-Whatever. Same difference.

463
00:32:24,892 --> 00:32:26,792
No, when l was 1 0
l didn't have an iPod.

464
00:32:26,961 --> 00:32:30,260
You're so cool. What are you listening to,
<i>Teletubbies Hit Parade</i>?

465
00:32:31,633 --> 00:32:33,533
You woke her up. Thank you.

466
00:32:38,806 --> 00:32:40,433
Must suck.

467
00:32:40,675 --> 00:32:43,838
-What?
-Having to babysit on your day off.

468
00:32:44,245 --> 00:32:45,837
Why are you working there, anyway?

469
00:32:46,014 --> 00:32:49,711
lt just so happens that l need some
extra money for new video equipment.

470
00:32:49,884 --> 00:32:53,945
When l finally got around to looking
for a new job, Wallmans was the....

471
00:32:54,122 --> 00:32:56,818
Why am l telling you this?
Don't you have somewhere to be?

472
00:32:56,991 --> 00:32:58,458
Not really.

473
00:33:00,495 --> 00:33:02,690
Looks like you got a lot already.

474
00:33:02,997 --> 00:33:06,160
-Are you making a movie or something?
-More like an ode.

475
00:33:06,334 --> 00:33:09,792
-To what?
-Lives of quiet desperation.

476
00:33:09,971 --> 00:33:12,132
Human existence at its lamest.

477
00:33:12,807 --> 00:33:16,174
-Fascinating. Maybe you need an assistant.
-Maybe l don't.

478
00:33:16,344 --> 00:33:19,836
You wouldn't have to pay me or anything.
l could carry equipment and stuff.

479
00:33:20,148 --> 00:33:21,877
Hi, honey.

480
00:33:22,050 --> 00:33:23,950
l'm sorry l'm late.

481
00:33:24,752 --> 00:33:26,083
Who's your friend?

482
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:29,223
-She's not my--
-Bailey, Bailey Graffman.

483
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:31,782
Well, l gotta go.

484
00:33:31,959 --> 00:33:33,517
See you around, Tibby.

485
00:33:44,338 --> 00:33:45,669
There you are.

486
00:33:53,014 --> 00:33:54,504
-Hi.
-Hey.

487
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:58,275
We should play tennis tomorrow.

488
00:33:59,087 --> 00:34:00,645
-Really?
-Yeah.

489
00:34:00,822 --> 00:34:01,880
-ln the morning?
-Yeah.

490
00:34:02,056 --> 00:34:05,082
Are you ready for this, old man?
You think your knees can take it?

491
00:34:05,259 --> 00:34:08,228
-You actually think you can return my serve?
-l do, Dad. l do.

492
00:34:08,396 --> 00:34:10,660
-Like to put money on that?
-l'll put money on it.

493
00:34:10,832 --> 00:34:11,856
-Sweetheart?
-Yeah.

494
00:34:12,033 --> 00:34:15,230
l gotta meet the caterers at the hotel.
Mind stopping by Paul's game?

495
00:34:15,403 --> 00:34:16,734
Sure.

496
00:34:16,904 --> 00:34:19,566
Well, he's an unbelievable
soccer player.

497
00:34:20,842 --> 00:34:22,707
We'll just stop for one second, okay?

498
00:34:22,877 --> 00:34:25,072
-lt's right on the way.
-Yeah. Yeah, okay.

499
00:34:45,767 --> 00:34:46,995
-Hey.
-How are you?

500
00:34:47,201 --> 00:34:50,500
Good. Didn't think your team
was scrimmaging till later today.

501
00:34:50,671 --> 00:34:53,640
They're not. l just came out early
to check out the competition.

502
00:34:56,110 --> 00:34:57,839
Well, you're looking at her.

503
00:35:00,114 --> 00:35:02,344
You're awfully sure of yourself, huh?

504
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:04,246
When l know what l want.

505
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:10,418
You got it!

506
00:35:10,658 --> 00:35:12,956
Take it down! Take it down!

507
00:35:15,329 --> 00:35:17,559
What's that?!

508
00:35:18,499 --> 00:35:20,592
Overtime! All right!

509
00:35:21,002 --> 00:35:23,664
-Overtime, yes.
-Which one of those is yours?

510
00:35:24,172 --> 00:35:25,833
Paul, Paul Rodman.

511
00:35:26,007 --> 00:35:28,669
So you're the golden boy's dad.
He's a good player.

512
00:35:28,843 --> 00:35:30,936
-Yeah, he is.
-Al!

513
00:35:49,997 --> 00:35:53,330
Okay. Pass!

514
00:35:53,868 --> 00:35:55,699
Pass, Vreeland!

515
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:58,004
Now!

516
00:36:03,945 --> 00:36:05,173
Yep, nice shot.

517
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:09,207
<i>We're not worthy!</i>
<i>We're not worthy!</i>

518
00:36:09,383 --> 00:36:12,147
Sub! Vreeland, you're out!

519
00:36:17,124 --> 00:36:19,285
This is a scrimmage, Vreeland,
as in practice.

520
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:21,223
Everyone on the team
needs to get some.

521
00:36:21,529 --> 00:36:23,554
We know you're a superstar, okay?
We got it.

522
00:36:23,731 --> 00:36:25,358
Now save it for the championship.

523
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,700
-Who do we got, Deanna?
-Katie, you're up.

524
00:36:27,869 --> 00:36:29,928
Okay, Katie, let's go, let's go!

525
00:36:30,104 --> 00:36:31,537
Same thing!

526
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:39,504
Nice! Get up, Wendy!
Get there! Yes!

527
00:36:40,147 --> 00:36:42,843
The hotel that's doing our wedding
had a water main break.

528
00:36:43,017 --> 00:36:46,418
-The whole place is flooded.
-The repairs won't be done for months.

529
00:36:46,587 --> 00:36:49,283
Oh, my God, the place
was just so perfect.

530
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:51,615
l'm never gonna find
another place in time.

531
00:36:51,792 --> 00:36:53,054
We will find a place.

532
00:36:53,227 --> 00:36:54,922
l'm sorry.

533
00:36:57,465 --> 00:36:59,660
Lydia never had a real wedding.

534
00:36:59,834 --> 00:37:04,464
My dad died just before my first and....

535
00:37:06,774 --> 00:37:09,766
Come on, let's get you home.
We'll work this out.

536
00:37:10,111 --> 00:37:13,740
Hey, Paul, you wanna
play tennis with Carmen?

537
00:37:13,915 --> 00:37:15,280
Great shot, Paul.

538
00:37:15,449 --> 00:37:17,349
-What?
-Lydia needs me, sweetie.

539
00:37:17,518 --> 00:37:20,009
lt'll be a chance for you
to get to know each other.

540
00:37:20,187 --> 00:37:22,621
Dad, Paul doesn't talk.

541
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:24,382
Yeah, he's a little shy.

542
00:37:25,259 --> 00:37:27,227
Go on. lt'll be fun.

543
00:37:27,395 --> 00:37:30,023
-We'll play tomorrow, okay?
-Okay.

544
00:37:46,948 --> 00:37:48,882
Oh, my God, are you okay?

545
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:51,508
Oh, my gosh! Are you okay?

546
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:52,948
l'm so sorry, l'm sorry!

547
00:37:53,821 --> 00:37:55,914
lt's swelling. l'm so sorry.

548
00:37:56,090 --> 00:37:59,651
-lt's no big deal.
-We should just stop.

549
00:37:59,827 --> 00:38:01,818
l'm tired anyway.

550
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:53,403
-<i>Kalimera</i>, Lena.
-No. l thought-- l didn't--

551
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:56,311
Well, here's your shirt. Thanks again.

552
00:38:56,484 --> 00:38:57,917
Lena, wait.

553
00:38:58,085 --> 00:39:00,576
l was just about to take her out.
Come with me?

554
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:02,848
No. l shouldn't even be here at all.

555
00:39:06,027 --> 00:39:07,494
They told you, didn't they?

556
00:39:07,661 --> 00:39:11,097
You think this is funny?
Our grandparents hate each other.

557
00:39:11,265 --> 00:39:14,063
You knew my name. Why didn't
you say something the other day?

558
00:39:14,235 --> 00:39:18,331
Well, because the arguments of old men
have nothing to do with us.

559
00:39:18,506 --> 00:39:21,737
Well, they're not arguing about nothing.
What was the fight about?

560
00:39:21,909 --> 00:39:24,036
What everything here is about:

561
00:39:24,211 --> 00:39:25,906
Money and fish.

562
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:28,548
My grandfather says
your grandfather cheat him.

563
00:39:28,716 --> 00:39:30,946
Your grandfather says
my grandfather...

564
00:39:31,118 --> 00:39:33,848
...sold him fish that make
his whole restaurant sick.

565
00:39:34,255 --> 00:39:35,586
So, what's the truth?

566
00:39:36,357 --> 00:39:40,350
The truth is that
it's a beautiful day and....

567
00:39:41,062 --> 00:39:43,428
Why should the rest of it matter?

568
00:39:44,131 --> 00:39:46,361
Because it does.

569
00:39:50,838 --> 00:39:52,135
Tibby.

570
00:39:52,606 --> 00:39:53,971
Tibby.

571
00:39:54,241 --> 00:39:57,472
Tibby, now, l have had another complaint
of receipt withholding.

572
00:39:57,645 --> 00:40:00,842
-This is your second offense and--
-You're gonna have to dock my pay.

573
00:40:01,015 --> 00:40:02,141
That's right.

574
00:40:02,316 --> 00:40:06,184
Also, the dress code
strictly prohibits blue jeans.

575
00:40:06,387 --> 00:40:07,376
Great.

576
00:40:19,967 --> 00:40:22,060
What are you doing with my stuff?

577
00:40:22,269 --> 00:40:24,931
Your mom gave it to me.
l told her l was your assistant.

578
00:40:26,173 --> 00:40:28,903
-You what? Wait--
-She seemed to think it was a good idea.

579
00:40:30,377 --> 00:40:33,346
Okay, look, you seem like a sweet kid.

580
00:40:33,914 --> 00:40:37,111
No, you seem like a pain in the ass.
But look, l have my own friends.

581
00:40:37,284 --> 00:40:40,549
Three best friends. Even though
they left me here to rot this summer...

582
00:40:40,721 --> 00:40:42,882
-...l'm not looking for new ones.
-Neither am l.

583
00:40:43,057 --> 00:40:45,457
l just think it'd be cool
to learn about filmmaking.

584
00:40:45,626 --> 00:40:49,357
Besides, l think l found
a good subject for an interview.

585
00:40:53,033 --> 00:40:56,434
His name is Brian McBrian,
king of ''Dragon's Lair.''

586
00:40:57,505 --> 00:40:59,837
l've heard he's broken
every record there is.

587
00:41:01,408 --> 00:41:03,638
Okay, he's definitely not
what you'd call lame...

588
00:41:03,811 --> 00:41:08,612
...but l figured he'd be a good contrast
to all the loser types in the movie.

589
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:10,447
Start setting up.

590
00:41:14,255 --> 00:41:15,244
Stand next to him.

591
00:41:15,422 --> 00:41:17,890
Pretend you're a fan,
like you watch him all the time.

592
00:41:18,058 --> 00:41:21,687
-Right.
-And action.

593
00:41:21,862 --> 00:41:26,094
Video arcade wizards are fixtures
at most convenience stores.

594
00:41:26,267 --> 00:41:28,997
Brian McBrian is a fixture at this one.

595
00:41:29,203 --> 00:41:30,795
''Dragon's Lair,'' he says...

596
00:41:31,238 --> 00:41:33,604
...is his calling.

597
00:41:34,175 --> 00:41:36,143
So, Brian, you spend a lot of time here?

598
00:41:37,478 --> 00:41:38,968
Sometimes all day.

599
00:41:39,146 --> 00:41:42,582
So you prefer to spend most
of your time here at the Quick Mart...

600
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:45,014
...instead of out in the real world?

601
00:41:45,186 --> 00:41:48,246
Well, maybe he finds the world of
''Dragon's Lair'' more interesting.

602
00:41:48,422 --> 00:41:50,219
Tell us about it, Brian.

603
00:41:51,158 --> 00:41:53,285
Well....

604
00:41:55,095 --> 00:41:59,589
Basically, you're Dirk the Daring...

605
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:02,793
...in the year 1 305 A.D.

606
00:42:02,970 --> 00:42:05,996
See, the goal
is to rescue Princess Daphne...

607
00:42:06,173 --> 00:42:08,232
...who's being guarded
by Singe, the dragon.

608
00:42:08,842 --> 00:42:12,369
See, chamber number one
is the Snake Room.

609
00:42:12,546 --> 00:42:15,845
-See, snakes slither from the ceiling.
-Really?

610
00:42:16,016 --> 00:42:19,713
You don't even get to see the dragon
until chamber number 23!

611
00:42:19,887 --> 00:42:21,548
Yeah!

612
00:42:23,057 --> 00:42:24,149
-Come on, come on!
-Yeah!

613
00:42:24,325 --> 00:42:26,486
Faster! Faster! Go!
He's right behind you!

614
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:29,026
-Go, go, go!
-Yeah, l got it.

615
00:42:29,363 --> 00:42:31,297
-Watch this, ready?
-Run fast!

616
00:42:38,472 --> 00:42:40,667
Oh, you must have run out of tape.

617
00:42:41,475 --> 00:42:43,306
What about the rest of the interview?

618
00:42:44,712 --> 00:42:47,203
Well, we could always
come back tomorrow, l guess.

619
00:42:47,381 --> 00:42:50,179
-l mean, if that's cool with you.
-Yeah.

620
00:42:59,126 --> 00:43:00,115
You all right?

621
00:43:01,562 --> 00:43:03,223
ls she speaking Spanish?

622
00:43:03,397 --> 00:43:06,093
-Oh, is that okay? ls that all right?
-Oh, sure! Sure.

623
00:43:06,267 --> 00:43:08,462
lt's just that nobody
understands it, sweetie.

624
00:43:08,636 --> 00:43:11,605
Oh, come on, Dad,
you know that is not true.

625
00:43:11,772 --> 00:43:14,434
He and my mom, they used to speak
Spanish all the time.

626
00:43:14,608 --> 00:43:16,735
Especially when they
started being all gushy...

627
00:43:16,910 --> 00:43:19,640
-...and they didn't want me to understand.
-Wow, it's 9:00?

628
00:43:19,813 --> 00:43:23,249
-But l totally understood them.
-l gotta drop that check at the caterers.

629
00:43:23,417 --> 00:43:25,851
Carmen, you're not gonna believe this.

630
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:29,114
We have decided to have the wedding
right here at home.

631
00:43:29,290 --> 00:43:31,224
With a big party in the back yard.

632
00:43:31,392 --> 00:43:34,361
Dancing under the stars.
lt's gonna be perfect.

633
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:37,789
Where's Paul?

634
00:43:37,965 --> 00:43:40,934
-Oh, he had an appointment.
-At the hospital?

635
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:45,532
Why would you say that?

636
00:43:45,706 --> 00:43:49,301
We were playing tennis the other day,
and l hit him, but it was an accident--

637
00:43:49,476 --> 00:43:50,943
-No, no. He's okay.
-He's fine.

638
00:43:51,111 --> 00:43:52,942
-He just--
-He just had to do something.

639
00:43:53,113 --> 00:43:54,808
Yeah.

640
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:08,887
-Dad, Dad, Dad.
-Yo.

641
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:12,525
What's going on?

642
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:14,759
Where exactly is Paul?

643
00:44:18,672 --> 00:44:20,640
He's in Atlanta, honey.

644
00:44:21,542 --> 00:44:25,603
Visiting his father.
His dad's in a facility.

645
00:44:25,779 --> 00:44:27,542
He's an alcoholic.

646
00:44:28,682 --> 00:44:31,810
Every month, Paul takes a bus
to visit him.

647
00:44:31,985 --> 00:44:34,283
Krista refuses to see him.

648
00:44:34,755 --> 00:44:36,450
She's not ready for that.

649
00:44:36,623 --> 00:44:39,091
Lydia doesn't want to upset her
by talking about it...

650
00:44:39,259 --> 00:44:41,955
...so we just say
Paul's out for the day.

651
00:44:44,031 --> 00:44:45,430
Okay.

652
00:44:47,534 --> 00:44:49,229
Natasha.

653
00:44:50,037 --> 00:44:51,937
Olivia.

654
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:54,768
Bridget.

655
00:44:55,476 --> 00:44:57,171
Polly.

656
00:44:58,245 --> 00:44:59,906
-Janna.
-Oh, tampons!

657
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:01,547
That's special, Mom.

658
00:45:01,715 --> 00:45:03,876
-Jo!
-Now, welcome to camp.

659
00:45:04,051 --> 00:45:05,040
Diana.

660
00:45:09,623 --> 00:45:12,683
Shampoo. Very, very practical.

661
00:45:21,301 --> 00:45:22,893
Hamburgers.

662
00:45:23,704 --> 00:45:27,037
Did you guys hear? Actually, they're
finally giving us Saturday off.

663
00:45:27,207 --> 00:45:29,641
Hallelujah. Can you say ''Cantina''?

664
00:45:31,111 --> 00:45:32,544
Hey, where's the Cantina?

665
00:45:32,713 --> 00:45:35,580
l don't know. l think somewhere
up the road. Why?

666
00:45:36,183 --> 00:45:37,775
He wants me to go.

667
00:45:38,552 --> 00:45:40,144
What?

668
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:42,185
He wants me to go.

669
00:45:42,356 --> 00:45:44,984
Why else would he have said
that right in front of me?

670
00:45:48,128 --> 00:45:49,356
This is my favorite part.

671
00:45:49,530 --> 00:45:51,930
When he takes the big risk
and launches the catapult.

672
00:45:52,099 --> 00:45:56,035
Bailey, come on, l'm trying to see if
there's something we can use from this.

673
00:45:56,203 --> 00:45:58,137
Just one thing.

674
00:46:00,674 --> 00:46:02,733
What was in the package?

675
00:46:04,878 --> 00:46:06,470
Just some....

676
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:08,545
Just those pair of pants over there.

677
00:46:08,715 --> 00:46:11,309
l'm sharing them
with my friends for the summer.

678
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:14,981
These?

679
00:46:16,356 --> 00:46:19,257
-What's so great about an old pair of jeans?
-Nothing.

680
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:22,258
They just happen to
mysteriously fit us all perfectly.

681
00:46:23,697 --> 00:46:24,959
Really?

682
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:28,734
l wonder what they'd look like on me.

683
00:46:28,902 --> 00:46:31,097
On the off-chance you'd ever
let me try them on.

684
00:46:31,872 --> 00:46:34,432
-Like now, for example.
-Go ahead, do whatever you want.

685
00:46:34,608 --> 00:46:36,508
l need some quiet.

686
00:46:38,745 --> 00:46:40,269
Tibby?

687
00:46:40,447 --> 00:46:42,312
l need you to take the baby!

688
00:47:12,112 --> 00:47:15,172
<i>My Carma-poochie-ay,</i>
<i>I'm writing from the post office...</i>

689
00:47:15,349 --> 00:47:19,115
<i>...and this express mail costs more</i>
<i>than I make in two hours at Wallmans...</i>

690
00:47:19,319 --> 00:47:21,753
<i>...so these jeans</i>
<i>better get to you tomorrow.</i>

691
00:47:21,922 --> 00:47:23,890
Here we are on a typical
Bethesda corner...

692
00:47:24,091 --> 00:47:27,390
...where generations of young entrepreneurs
have proved the old adage:

693
00:47:27,561 --> 00:47:29,893
''When life hands you lemons,
make lemonade.''

694
00:47:30,063 --> 00:47:32,190
So the question on my mind is...

695
00:47:32,366 --> 00:47:34,664
...is this fresh-squeezed or powder?

696
00:47:34,835 --> 00:47:37,804
-Does it matter if it's good lemonade?
-Let me ask the questions.

697
00:47:37,971 --> 00:47:40,565
<i>I'm sad to report that</i>
<i>nothing of consequence happened...</i>

698
00:47:40,741 --> 00:47:42,333
<i>...while wearing the pants.</i>

699
00:47:42,509 --> 00:47:43,533
<i>I spilled a Sprite...</i>

700
00:47:43,710 --> 00:47:46,543
<i>...and my rat-faced manager</i>
<i>accused me of receipt withholding.</i>

701
00:47:46,713 --> 00:47:49,113
-Receipt withholding.
-<i>In rat-faced manager lingo...</i>

702
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:51,683
<i>...that means forgetting</i>
<i>to give a sales slip.</i>

703
00:47:51,852 --> 00:47:53,786
You know, l was reading
that Bill Gates...

704
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:56,115
...when he was younger,
he ran a lemonade stand.

705
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:59,623
-You don't know that, that's not--
-Yeah, l do. l read it in a magazine.

706
00:47:59,793 --> 00:48:01,727
-Where did you read that?
-ln a magazine.

707
00:48:01,895 --> 00:48:05,058
<i>Other than that, the only thing</i>
<i>that I have to show for the pants</i>...

708
00:48:05,232 --> 00:48:08,360
<i>...is the kid that delivered them,</i>
<i>some wise-ass pain in the neck...</i>

709
00:48:08,535 --> 00:48:11,060
<i>...who's decided to permanently</i>
<i>glue herself to my hip.</i>

710
00:48:11,238 --> 00:48:14,435
She's just tired. She's been there
a really long time, all day.

711
00:48:14,608 --> 00:48:16,439
What is she doing right there?
Tell me.

712
00:48:16,610 --> 00:48:20,569
-She's just thinking. She's strategizing.
-l think she's trying to grow a brain.

713
00:48:20,747 --> 00:48:22,942
<i>Too bad you can't express mail</i>
<i>1 2-year-olds.</i>

714
00:48:23,116 --> 00:48:26,085
And l wish you the very best of luck
on this endeavor.

715
00:48:48,775 --> 00:48:51,107
Hey. Hey there, sleepyhead.

716
00:48:51,845 --> 00:48:53,073
Hey, Carmen.

717
00:48:53,246 --> 00:48:55,305
-Honey, time to wake up.
-Hi.

718
00:48:55,482 --> 00:48:57,347
Hi there. Good morning.

719
00:48:57,517 --> 00:48:58,643
Sorry to wake you...

720
00:48:58,819 --> 00:49:01,845
...but l was just wondering if
Maria could grab your sheets.

721
00:49:02,122 --> 00:49:04,852
-Maria?
-Yeah, our housekeeper.

722
00:49:05,459 --> 00:49:07,654
l told her you usually slept late...

723
00:49:07,828 --> 00:49:10,160
...but l don't think she understood me.

724
00:49:10,330 --> 00:49:12,798
Her English isn't real good.

725
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:17,269
Okay, right.

726
00:49:17,437 --> 00:49:19,530
Could l-- l'll just wash my own sheets.

727
00:49:19,706 --> 00:49:21,333
No, no, no. Don't be silly.

728
00:49:21,508 --> 00:49:23,772
Maria can certainly do your sheets,
not a problem.

729
00:49:23,944 --> 00:49:25,935
-Lydia, it's really--
-lt's a beautiful day.

730
00:49:26,113 --> 00:49:29,207
-You shouldn't be washing sheets.
-Oh, it's not a problem at all.

731
00:49:29,383 --> 00:49:31,010
l usually do it myself anyway.

732
00:49:31,184 --> 00:49:35,644
l do it all the time. l'm so used to it.
People wash their sheets all the time.

733
00:49:38,125 --> 00:49:39,649
Okay.

734
00:50:33,678 --> 00:50:35,373
Been here long?

735
00:50:35,546 --> 00:50:38,413
Kostas. What are you doing here?

736
00:50:39,183 --> 00:50:40,707
lt's a fish market.

737
00:50:40,885 --> 00:50:42,546
This is where l sell my fish.

738
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:44,153
Right.

739
00:50:44,455 --> 00:50:46,650
But you already knew that, eh?

740
00:50:46,824 --> 00:50:48,121
Excuse me?

741
00:50:48,292 --> 00:50:50,385
Lena, no one sits
near a smelly fish market...

742
00:50:50,561 --> 00:50:52,392
...unless they're waiting for someone.

743
00:50:52,897 --> 00:50:54,922
Well, l don't know
what you're talking about.

744
00:50:55,099 --> 00:50:57,533
l just came to sketch
that old church over there.

745
00:50:57,702 --> 00:50:59,329
May l?

746
00:50:59,504 --> 00:51:03,031
Well, it's-- lt's not finished.

747
00:51:12,784 --> 00:51:16,083
-You didn't tell me you were an artist.
-l'm not, really.

748
00:51:16,454 --> 00:51:18,319
Lena, you are.

749
00:51:19,190 --> 00:51:21,750
My parents were married in that church...

750
00:51:21,926 --> 00:51:23,894
...before they left for the United States.

751
00:51:24,061 --> 00:51:26,052
Why did they come back to Greece?

752
00:51:26,998 --> 00:51:28,659
They didn't.

753
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:32,028
They were killed in a car accident...

754
00:51:32,570 --> 00:51:34,333
...when l was 1 2.

755
00:51:34,872 --> 00:51:37,500
l come back to live with my grandfather.

756
00:51:37,675 --> 00:51:39,404
l'm sorry.

757
00:51:40,812 --> 00:51:43,110
What made you choose to paint this?

758
00:51:46,017 --> 00:51:47,450
l don't know.

759
00:51:48,486 --> 00:51:50,818
l liked it because,
when you first look at it...

760
00:51:50,988 --> 00:51:53,013
...it looks kind of forgotten, and then....

761
00:51:53,291 --> 00:51:57,227
But then you realize that
that's why it's beautiful.

762
00:51:57,528 --> 00:51:59,962
lt's perfect in all its loneliness.

763
00:52:01,866 --> 00:52:03,493
You see?

764
00:52:03,668 --> 00:52:05,898
Lena Kaligaris...

765
00:52:06,070 --> 00:52:08,265
...you are an artist.

766
00:52:09,841 --> 00:52:11,138
And you should finish it.

767
00:52:12,910 --> 00:52:14,377
Well, maybe some other time.

768
00:52:14,545 --> 00:52:15,910
l mean, l really should go.

769
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:19,208
-lf my grandparents saw me here, they'd--
-They'd what?

770
00:52:19,684 --> 00:52:22,152
ls it really them you're afraid of?

771
00:52:22,453 --> 00:52:24,182
Or is it something else?

772
00:52:26,891 --> 00:52:28,518
What do you mean?

773
00:52:28,693 --> 00:52:31,526
-You don't even know me.
-l'm trying to.

774
00:52:31,762 --> 00:52:34,060
Or can't you see that?

775
00:53:21,379 --> 00:53:24,871
<i>He's right, Car. I am afraid.</i>

776
00:53:26,250 --> 00:53:29,515
<i>There's a part of me</i>
<i>that wants to let him in...</i>

777
00:53:29,687 --> 00:53:32,554
<i>...but then I feel myself</i>
<i>put this wall up...</i>

778
00:53:32,723 --> 00:53:35,191
<i>...and I don't understand why.</i>

779
00:53:35,793 --> 00:53:38,762
<i>Maybe that's what strikes me</i>
<i>most about Kostas.</i>

780
00:53:38,930 --> 00:53:41,023
<i>That despite everything he's suffered...</i>

781
00:53:41,198 --> 00:53:46,329
<i>...he can still look at life</i>
<i>in the most uncomplicated way.</i>

782
00:53:46,804 --> 00:53:49,466
<i>I've never known that kind of faith.</i>

783
00:53:50,441 --> 00:53:54,502
<i>It makes me so sad</i>
<i>that people like Kostas and Bridget...</i>

784
00:53:54,679 --> 00:53:56,271
<i>...who have lost everything...</i>

785
00:53:56,447 --> 00:53:59,575
<i>...can still be open to love...</i>

786
00:54:00,051 --> 00:54:05,114
<i>...while I, who have lost nothing, am not.</i>
