That goes there.

And this gear connects to that.

That should do it.

Ow!

Where did that come from?

That's strange.

- Good morning, Cog.

00:01:49,333 --> 00:01:51,300
- Eh, if you say so.

00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,300
- You know what'll
make you feel better?

46
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:56,467
Digging.
Digging makes everything better.

47
00:01:56,467 --> 00:01:59,300
- Not for me.
I don't like digging.

he doesn't like to dig?

- What do you mean
you don't like digging?

52
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:07,900
We're grunts.
All grunts love to dig.

53
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:10,067
Digging is the best.

54
00:02:10,067 --> 00:02:11,967
- Digging is a waste of time.

55
00:02:11,967 --> 00:02:14,600
This machine could dig a tunnel
in half the time

56
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,600
it take you to do it
with your shovels.

57
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:20,800
- I don't know.
Looks pretty complicated.

No way!

It's easy.

All you have to do is
pull this lever.

Wait, no.
Yeah, that's not it.

72
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:49,567
but I think we'll stick to
old-fashioned digging.

73
00:02:49,567 --> 00:02:53,567
You should try it.
It's just plain fun!

that my machine is better
than digging by hand.

- That was strange.
I just granted a wish.

96
00:03:45,067 --> 00:03:47,867
But I didn't hear you
make a wish, Leah.

97
00:03:47,867 --> 00:03:49,467
- That's because I didn't.

98
00:03:49,467 --> 00:03:50,933
- But that's impossible.

You're the only person
that can make a wish,

100
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:55,067

your magic genie bottle

It's gone!

It must've fallen off
while I was swinging.

106
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,133
- Someone must've found
your necklace,

107
00:04:04,133 --> 00:04:05,600
and is making wishes with it.

108
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,067
- Well, whoever it is
must be around here somewhere.

109
00:04:08,067 --> 00:04:09,833
- Come on,
we'll find your necklace.

the first wish of the day.

Sounds like
it's coming from underground.

116
00:04:23,533 --> 00:04:26,367
- Hmm, could be a grunt.

- A grunt?
What's that?

- They're little creatures
who live underground.

119
00:04:31,533 --> 00:04:33,133
They don't have any magic,

120
00:04:33,133 --> 00:04:36,567
but they're really, really,
really good at digging.

121
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:39,333
- Yeah, but they hardly ever
come above ground.

Uh, why are genies following me?

This thing is magic?

Well, finders keepers!

I'm never gonna give this back,

00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:01,133
It's a magic necklace!

181
00:07:01,133 --> 00:07:03,067
Now watch this!

182
00:07:03,067 --> 00:07:08,867
Oh, magic necklace, put a stop
to all digging forever!

183
00:07:08,867 --> 00:07:11,200
[all gasp]
all: He wouldn't.

184
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,500
all: He couldn't!

185
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,600
- Swish, swish, swish!

186
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:22,500
- Whoo-hoo!
The spell didn't work.

187
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,900
We can still dig!

188
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,933
All right, everybody,
back to digging.

189
00:07:27,933 --> 00:07:30,067
*

190
00:07:30,067 --> 00:07:33,067
- I don't understand.
Why didn't you work?

191
00:07:33,067 --> 00:07:37,067
I know.
Maybe there's a magic word.

192
00:07:37,067 --> 00:07:38,967
Hocus-pocus!

193
00:07:38,967 --> 00:07:40,800
[grunts]
Fiddley-fee!

194
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,267
Zippity zop!
Doodly dee?

195
00:07:43,267 --> 00:07:44,900
- Come on, Cog, help us out.

196
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,600
- I don't want to help.

197
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,067
I'm gonna use my magic

198
00:07:48,067 --> 00:07:50,633
so that I never
have to dig again!

199
00:07:50,633 --> 00:07:52,700
- [sighs]
Suit yourself.

200
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:55,067
- Magic start!

201
00:07:55,067 --> 00:07:56,433
Magic begin!

202
00:07:56,433 --> 00:07:57,900
Magic go!

203
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:00,667
Swish, swish, swish!

204
00:08:00,667 --> 00:08:02,333
Swish, swish, swish!

205
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:03,833
- Maybe this way.

206
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:06,267
- Look, the city
where the grunts live.

207
00:08:06,267 --> 00:08:10,067
- Wow,
this place is Zahramazing.

208
00:08:10,067 --> 00:08:11,233
- Yeah.

209
00:08:11,233 --> 00:08:13,200
Those grunts
sure know how to dig.

210
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:16,533
Look, there's the grunt
with your necklace.

211
00:08:16,533 --> 00:08:17,800
- [groans]
Oh...

212
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,333
I wish I knew
how this thing worked.

213
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:23,933
- Boom Zahramay!
Third wish of the day!

214
00:08:23,933 --> 00:08:27,533
Shimmer and Shine!
Wish granted divine!

215
00:08:27,533 --> 00:08:29,833
[chimes tinkling]

216
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:32,300
- To make
the genie necklace work,

217
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:36,100
all you have to do
is say, "I wish."

218
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:38,533
* *

219
00:08:38,533 --> 00:08:40,067
- [gasps]
I wish!

220
00:08:40,067 --> 00:08:41,133
Of course!

221
00:08:41,133 --> 00:08:43,700
All I have to do is say,
"I wish."

222
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,800
I wish everyone
would stop digging.

223
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,067
I wish I were
king of the grunts.

224
00:08:48,067 --> 00:08:52,633
I wish I could keep
this necklace forever.

225
00:08:52,633 --> 00:08:53,833
Huh?

226
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:58,500
I said, "I wish,"
but nothing happened.

227
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,633
Magic necklace, this is Cog.

228
00:09:01,633 --> 00:09:03,267
Hey, I'm talking to you!

229
00:09:03,267 --> 00:09:05,567
- Excuse me?
Cog?

230
00:09:05,567 --> 00:09:06,967
- Oh, it's you.

231
00:09:06,967 --> 00:09:08,567
[stammers]
Not now.

232
00:09:08,567 --> 00:09:10,900
I'm trying to figure out
why this thing won't work.

233
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:13,333
I wish you genies
would disappear.

234
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:15,067
- Still here.

235
00:09:15,067 --> 00:09:17,067
- Good thing he's out of wishes.

236
00:09:17,067 --> 00:09:18,067
- [groans]
Ah!

237
00:09:18,067 --> 00:09:20,067
Why won't this thing work?

238
00:09:20,067 --> 00:09:22,067
[engine rumbling]

239
00:09:22,067 --> 00:09:23,467
Uh-oh.

240
00:09:23,467 --> 00:09:25,067
- Oh, no!
- Ow, my toe!

241
00:09:25,067 --> 00:09:26,467
- Ouch!
- Look out!

242
00:09:26,467 --> 00:09:27,800
- Here it comes!

243
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,567
- Oh, no,
we have to stop that machine.

244
00:09:29,567 --> 00:09:31,567
- Help!
- And help those grunts.

245
00:09:31,567 --> 00:09:34,300
- Come on.

246
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,500
- Uh-oh!
- Run!

247
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,767
- Everyone, grab a grunt!

248
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:38,433
- Yeah!
- Thank you!

249
00:09:38,433 --> 00:09:39,733
- Here it comes!
- Uh-oh!

250
00:09:39,733 --> 00:09:41,567
- Run!
- This is bad!

251
00:09:41,567 --> 00:09:44,633
- Oh, no!
- Look out!

252
00:09:44,633 --> 00:09:46,433
- Help!

253
00:09:46,433 --> 00:09:48,500
- Got ya.

254
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,567
- That was a close one.

255
00:09:50,567 --> 00:09:52,233
- Look, over there!
- Help!

256
00:09:52,233 --> 00:09:54,267
- And over there!
- Whoa, whoa-whoa-whoa!

257
00:09:54,267 --> 00:09:57,333
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa...
- It's Cog!

258
00:09:57,333 --> 00:10:00,000
Come back here!

259
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,500
Quick, you guys save them,
and I'll save Cog.

260
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,767
- Okay!
both: Help!

261
00:10:04,767 --> 00:10:07,133
- Got ya!
- I wish this thing would stop.

262
00:10:07,133 --> 00:10:09,367
I wish this thing would stop!

263
00:10:09,367 --> 00:10:11,300
- I'm coming, Cog!

264
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:14,000
- Whoa!
- Shimmer, Shine, help Cog!

265
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,833
[chimes tinkling]
- Whoa!

266
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:18,800
Whoa--oh, ah.
[sighs]

267
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,667
[tires screech]
- Hooray, we're saved!

268
00:10:22,667 --> 00:10:25,867
And now we have
lots of digging to do!

269
00:10:25,867 --> 00:10:27,967
- Hooray!
- I love to dig!

270
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:29,733
- Yay!
- [giggling]

271
00:10:29,733 --> 00:10:31,133
- I don't get it.

272
00:10:31,133 --> 00:10:33,867
Why did the magic in
the magic necklace stop working?

273
00:10:33,867 --> 00:10:35,867
- The necklace
only gives you three wishes,

274
00:10:35,867 --> 00:10:37,967
and you already made
your three wishes.

275
00:10:37,967 --> 00:10:40,367
- Only three wishes?

276
00:10:40,367 --> 00:10:41,767
What good is a magic necklace

277
00:10:41,767 --> 00:10:44,067
is it only gives you
three lousy wishes?

278
00:10:44,067 --> 00:10:46,600
- Three wishes a day.

279
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,933
- A day?

280
00:10:47,933 --> 00:10:50,167
You mean you get
three more wishes tomorrow?

281
00:10:50,167 --> 00:10:51,167
- Uh-huh.

282
00:10:51,167 --> 00:10:52,767
- Okay, could you
give me that back?

283
00:10:52,767 --> 00:10:54,900
- Sorry, Cog, it's not yours,

284
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:57,067
but I think this is.

285
00:10:57,067 --> 00:11:00,567
- Come on, we'll help you dig.
- [groans]

286
00:11:00,567 --> 00:11:03,433
[grunting]

287
00:11:04,567 --> 00:11:06,067
- Great digging, Cog.

288
00:11:06,067 --> 00:11:08,133
And after you finish this hole,

289
00:11:08,133 --> 00:11:13,333
you can dig another
and another and another!

290
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:15,467
- [sighs]

291
00:11:15,467 --> 00:11:17,833
- [giggles] Sounds like
we'd better get started.

292
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:19,767
- Whoo-hoo!
- Yeah!

293
00:11:19,767 --> 00:11:22,967
- All right!
[all giggle]

294
00:11:22,967 --> 00:11:26,433
- Hey, you know what?
Digging is kind of fun.

295
00:11:26,433 --> 00:11:27,900
[all giggle]

296
00:11:30,967 --> 00:11:34,167
[exotic music]

297
00:11:34,167 --> 00:11:35,133
* *

298
00:11:35,133 --> 00:11:37,367
- Yeah!
- [giggles]

299
00:11:37,367 --> 00:11:39,667
- Whoo-hoo!
- These pogo sticks

300
00:11:39,667 --> 00:11:43,067
were the best, best,
best first wish ever, Zac!

301
00:11:43,067 --> 00:11:45,367
- And I think Tala, Nahal,
and Parisa will agree

302
00:11:45,367 --> 00:11:48,667
that this polka-dot pasta was
the tastiest second wish ever.

303
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:49,867
all: Uh-huh.

304
00:11:49,867 --> 00:11:52,400
- Zahramay Falls is awesome!

305
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,667
[all chatter]

306
00:11:53,667 --> 00:11:55,600
- Where else can you bounce off
a pogo stick

307
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,900
and land in a giant bowl
of polka-dot noodles?

308
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:02,133
I wish I could
live here forever.

309
00:12:02,133 --> 00:12:05,100
all: No!
- No, no, no, no.

310
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:08,267
Boom Zahramay.
Third wish of the day.

311
00:12:08,267 --> 00:12:13,400
With some flash and pizzazz,
wish granted by Kaz.

312
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,267
[chimes tinkling]

313
00:12:15,267 --> 00:12:17,267
- Uh, what just happened?

314
00:12:17,267 --> 00:12:20,100
- You just wished
you could live here forever

315
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:22,400
with your last wish of the day.

316
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,500
- I'm so sorry, Zac.
I didn't want to grant it,

317
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:27,600
but you said, "Wish,"
and I just had to.

318
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,167
- Oh, well.

319
00:12:29,167 --> 00:12:31,500
I guess living in Zahramay Falls
forever isn't so bad.

320
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,233
I like it here.
Mmm.

321
00:12:33,233 --> 00:12:35,467
Plenty of polka-dot noodles
to go around.

322
00:12:35,467 --> 00:12:38,567
But these could
definitely use some mustard.

323
00:12:38,567 --> 00:12:40,233
Do you guys have some
in your kitchen?

324
00:12:40,233 --> 00:12:43,700
- Actually, we don't have
mustard in Zahramay Falls.

325
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:46,333
- [gasps]
No mu-mustard?

326
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:47,467
No!

327
00:12:47,467 --> 00:12:48,867
I have to find a way
to get back home

328
00:12:48,867 --> 00:12:50,100
where there's mustard.

329
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,733
- Couldn't I just use
one of my wishes

330
00:12:51,733 --> 00:12:53,067
to wish that Zac could go home?

331
00:12:53,067 --> 00:12:56,300
- Sorry, Leah.
Wish magic is so powerful,

332
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:58,900
one wish can't be used
to change another one.

333
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,567
- There must be
something we can do.

334
00:13:00,567 --> 00:13:02,733
- What about
the Wishy Washy Genie?

335
00:13:02,733 --> 00:13:05,467
- The Wishy who now?
- The Wishy Washy Genie.

336
00:13:05,467 --> 00:13:08,733
He's a genie who has the power
to wash away one wish.

337
00:13:08,733 --> 00:13:11,167
He can get rid of
your wish to never leave,

338
00:13:11,167 --> 00:13:13,067
and make it like
you never wished it.

339
00:13:13,067 --> 00:13:16,067
- And that means
I'll totally be able to go home.

340
00:13:16,067 --> 00:13:17,700
Awesome!
- But Kaz...

341
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:20,633
the Wishy Washy Genie
is just a legend.

342
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:23,067
He doesn't really exist.

343
00:13:23,067 --> 00:13:26,100
- Are you kidding?
Of course he does.

344
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:29,133
- So...where do we find him?

345
00:13:29,133 --> 00:13:32,867
- Well, legend says he lives in
the Zahramay Forest,

346
00:13:32,867 --> 00:13:34,933
but no one knows where exactly.

347
00:13:34,933 --> 00:13:36,667
- Because he doesn't exist.

348
00:13:36,667 --> 00:13:38,800
- Or he's just shy.

349
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,300
- Maybe I can use
a wish to find him.

350
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,967
- Do it, Leah, please!

351
00:13:42,967 --> 00:13:45,233
I'm already starting to forget
what mustard tastes like.

352
00:13:45,233 --> 00:13:47,167
- [giggles]
Don't worry, Zac.

353
00:13:47,167 --> 00:13:50,400
I wish we could find
the Wishy Washy Genie.

354
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:54,067
- Boom Zahramay!
First wish of the day!

355
00:13:54,067 --> 00:13:57,667
Shimmer and Shine!
Wish granted divine!

356
00:13:57,667 --> 00:13:59,833
- Which way do I go?

357
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:01,733
Which way do I go?

358
00:14:01,733 --> 00:14:03,433
Hmm...
[whooshes]

359
00:14:03,433 --> 00:14:06,567
- Look! That must be
the Wishy Washy Genie!

360
00:14:06,567 --> 00:14:08,333
- He's real?

361
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:10,400
- [chuckles]
Of course I'm real.

362
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:13,167
Uh, but how do you know
who I am?

363
00:14:13,167 --> 00:14:15,200
- I'm a huge fan of your work.

364
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,633
When you washed away the wish

365
00:14:16,633 --> 00:14:19,067
that caused the great
Rainbow Waters flood

366
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:21,167
in the marketplace
all those years ago?

367
00:14:21,167 --> 00:14:23,067
That was epic!
- It was?

368
00:14:23,067 --> 00:14:24,700
Oh, why--why, thank you!

369
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:27,100
- What are you doing
standing out here anyway?

370
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:30,333
- I am trying to
figure out where to go.

371
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:31,933
Should I go to the beach?
Yes.

372
00:14:31,933 --> 00:14:34,100
Or the Ice Palace?
The jungle!

373
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:37,167
Oh, there's just
so many places to choose.

374
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:39,367
Don't you agree, uh--um...?

375
00:14:39,367 --> 00:14:41,933
- I'm Kaz,
and these are my friends,

376
00:14:41,933 --> 00:14:44,400
Shimmer, Shine, Leah, and Zac.

377
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:47,067
- Please, Wishy Washy Genie,
you gotta help me.

378
00:14:47,067 --> 00:14:48,867
The mustard!
The mustard!

379
00:14:48,867 --> 00:14:50,467
- Mustard?

380
00:14:50,467 --> 00:14:53,567
- Zac isn't really a genie,
and he accidentally wished that

381
00:14:53,567 --> 00:14:55,500
he could live in
Zahramay Falls forever.

382
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:58,333
Now he's stuck here
with no way of getting home.

383
00:14:58,333 --> 00:15:00,833
- I told them all about
your legendary power

384
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:02,233
to wash away a wish,

385
00:15:02,233 --> 00:15:05,400
and we were wondering
if you'd be able to help Zac.

386
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,333
- Sure!
But should I?

387
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:08,567
What if I wash away a wish

388
00:15:08,567 --> 00:15:10,067
and something
really bad happens?

389
00:15:10,067 --> 00:15:12,100
Or what if I don't wash a wish

390
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,767
and something
really bad happens?

391
00:15:13,767 --> 00:15:16,500
Oh, I just can't decide.

392
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,767
This is so hard.

393
00:15:18,767 --> 00:15:22,567
- Looks like the Wishy Washy
Genie really is wishy washy.

394
00:15:22,567 --> 00:15:23,800
- You're right.

395
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,733
He can't make up his mind
about anything.

396
00:15:25,733 --> 00:15:27,367
- And even if
I were to help you,

397
00:15:27,367 --> 00:15:29,600
I'd need to perform
my Wishy Washy Spell,

398
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,933
and for that,
I need my Wishy Washy Staff.

399
00:15:32,933 --> 00:15:34,400
- Great, where is it?

400
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,600
- Oh, that's easy.
I left it at, uh...

401
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,933
No...yes!

402
00:15:39,933 --> 00:15:41,467
Nura Valley!

403
00:15:41,467 --> 00:15:44,667
- Well then,
I wish we were at Nura Valley.

404
00:15:44,667 --> 00:15:48,333
- Boom Zahramay!
Second wish of the day!

405
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:51,767
Shimmer and Shine!
Wish granted divine!

406
00:15:51,767 --> 00:15:53,200
[chimes tinkling]

407
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:57,100
- Ah, Nura Valley.

408
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:59,267
- But I don't see your staff.

409
00:15:59,267 --> 00:16:01,067
[playful music]

410
00:16:01,067 --> 00:16:01,867
- Uh-oh.

411
00:16:05,533 --> 00:16:08,433
- Hmm,
maybe I left it over here.

412
00:16:08,433 --> 00:16:11,300
No, no, maybe over there.

413
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,500
Ah-ha!
I just remembered.

414
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,667
I was going to leave the staff
at Nura Valley,

415
00:16:15,667 --> 00:16:17,167
but then I changed my mind,

416
00:16:17,167 --> 00:16:18,967
because what if a bird
flew away with it?

417
00:16:18,967 --> 00:16:22,833
So I thought maybe I should
leave it in the Zahramay Forest,

418
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:24,533
but then I changed my mind,

419
00:16:24,533 --> 00:16:26,300
because what if
a giant lizard ate it?

420
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:30,367
So I thought maybe I should
leave it by the Rainbow River.

421
00:16:30,367 --> 00:16:33,200
- So...
your staff's by the river?

422
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:37,100
- No, I just left it at home
where I always leave it.

423
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:39,433
- Isn't he great?

424
00:16:39,433 --> 00:16:41,867
- Okay, well,
where's your house?

425
00:16:41,867 --> 00:16:44,400
- There, at the top
of that mountain

426
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,933
on the other side of the forest.

427
00:16:45,933 --> 00:16:49,467
- Maybe we better save
my last wish and walk there,

428
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:51,433
just in case he forgot
where he really left

429
00:16:51,433 --> 00:16:54,267
his Wishy Washy Staff.
both: Good idea!

430
00:16:54,267 --> 00:16:56,500
Lead the way,
Mr. Wishy Washy Genie.

431
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,167
- Right this way!

432
00:16:58,167 --> 00:17:02,133
[cheery music]

433
00:17:02,133 --> 00:17:03,633
Ah, here we are.

434
00:17:03,633 --> 00:17:06,633
Now...this one or that one?

435
00:17:06,633 --> 00:17:10,067
- So which bridge do we take,
Mr. Wishy Washy Genie sir?

436
00:17:10,067 --> 00:17:12,400
- Um...this one.

437
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,233
Oh, no, that one.

438
00:17:15,233 --> 00:17:16,467
We could do both.

439
00:17:16,467 --> 00:17:18,433
Oh!
I don't know.

440
00:17:18,433 --> 00:17:20,767
This decision is too hard.

441
00:17:20,767 --> 00:17:23,867
What if we take the one
and we're attacked by bees?

442
00:17:23,867 --> 00:17:25,833
But then,
if we take the other one

443
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:27,700
and there are snakes
on the bridge?

444
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,300
But then if we go on
the other other one

445
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:32,100
and there are snakes
who can fly like bees!

446
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:35,967
Oh, I can't decide.
It's too hard to choose.

447
00:17:35,967 --> 00:17:38,767
- Mr. Wishy Washy, you're right.

448
00:17:38,767 --> 00:17:40,900
Making choices can be hard,

449
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:43,600
and sometimes, you don't know
what will happen,

450
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,300
so you just have to choose
and stick to it.

451
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:49,567
Do what you decided to do,
and then see what happens.

452
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:53,667
- Well, I never really
thought of that before.

453
00:17:53,667 --> 00:17:56,567
Hmm, okay, this way.

454
00:17:56,567 --> 00:17:58,400
- See?
That wasn't so hard.

455
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:03,067
*

456
00:18:03,067 --> 00:18:07,167
- Um, did you notice
how high up we are?

457
00:18:07,167 --> 00:18:08,667
- Don't worry, Kaz,

458
00:18:08,667 --> 00:18:10,467
we're almost to the other side.

459
00:18:10,467 --> 00:18:12,367
[tense music]

460
00:18:12,367 --> 00:18:15,433
- Whoa!
Um, what just happened?

461
00:18:15,433 --> 00:18:17,567
- The ropes are ripping!

462
00:18:17,567 --> 00:18:19,933
- Everyone, hang on.

463
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:23,400
all: Whoa!

464
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,633
- We...
[grunts]

465
00:18:24,633 --> 00:18:25,800
Got this.

466
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:28,633
- But if you could please hurry.

467
00:18:28,633 --> 00:18:30,433
This is really heavy.

468
00:18:30,433 --> 00:18:32,133
- [chuckles]
Oh, wait, I forgot.

469
00:18:32,133 --> 00:18:35,500
I can fly.
I've got you.

470
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:38,500
[cheery music]

471
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,233
Uh, sorry, everyone.

472
00:18:40,233 --> 00:18:43,567
None of this would've happened
if I hadn't picked that bridge.

473
00:18:43,567 --> 00:18:47,433
- Um, I'm not so sure the other
bridge would've been better.

474
00:18:47,433 --> 00:18:49,133
*

475
00:18:49,133 --> 00:18:50,867
[crashes]

476
00:18:50,867 --> 00:18:53,167
- And besides,
we all made it safe and sound.

477
00:18:53,167 --> 00:18:56,067
- True, and now
we're almost to my home.

478
00:18:56,067 --> 00:18:58,767
Follow me!

479
00:18:58,767 --> 00:19:01,633
All aboard!
These carts will lead us

480
00:19:01,633 --> 00:19:03,767
right to the top
of the mountain.

481
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:06,733
- Wow!
- Great!

482
00:19:06,733 --> 00:19:07,900
- And now...

483
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:11,067

Ready?

486
00:19:15,633 --> 00:19:18,067
- Oh, we need safety bars.

487

[whooshing]

488
00:19:20,267 --> 00:19:22,333
Just in case.

00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:24,067
- Hang on!

It's ending!

- Use a wish, Leah.
- Hurry!

528
00:20:49,733 --> 00:20:52,967
- Great, now that you have
your Wishy Washy Staff,

529
00:20:52,967 --> 00:20:56,367
you can wash away Zac's wish
and he can go home.

530
00:20:56,367 --> 00:20:58,600
- Yep.
Oh, but should I?

531
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,300
What if I perform
my Wishy Washy Spell

532
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,733
and it doesn't work?
Or it works too well

533
00:21:02,733 --> 00:21:04,100
and you can never
come back here?

534
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:06,067
Or you wind up
stuck inside a bottle?

535
00:21:06,067 --> 00:21:09,067
Or accidentally get sent to
the center of a volcano?

536
00:21:09,067 --> 00:21:11,733
Or turned into a giant kitten?

537
00:21:11,733 --> 00:21:14,067
- Aww, a Zac-kitten.

538
00:21:14,067 --> 00:21:17,733
- Oh, I can't make a decision.

539
00:21:17,733 --> 00:21:19,500
- But Mr. Wishy Washy Genie,

540
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:22,600
you have been
making decisions all along.

541
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,700
- Leah's right.

542
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,400
You decided
which bridge to take.

543
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,300
- And which track to take.

544
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,700
- You're right.

545
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:31,067
I guess I have been
making decisions all along.

546
00:21:31,067 --> 00:21:33,833
Zac, let's wash away your wish.

547
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:36,967
- Oh, yeah!
Mustard, here I come!

548
00:21:36,967 --> 00:21:39,933
- Wishy Wash, wash away!

549
00:21:39,933 --> 00:21:43,233
[chimes tinkling]
Your wish is gone!

550
00:21:43,233 --> 00:21:46,067
There, your wish
has been washed away.

551
00:21:46,067 --> 00:21:47,800
You can now go back
to your home.

552
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,733
- Thank you, Wishy Washy Genie!

553
00:21:49,733 --> 00:21:51,300
- I should be thanking you.

554
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:52,833
From now on,

555
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:55,867
I won't be afraid to make
a choice and stick to it.

556
00:21:55,867 --> 00:21:57,300
Good-bye, everyone.

557
00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:00,533
Now, which door
should I use to go inside?

558
00:22:00,533 --> 00:22:03,600
How about this one?

559
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,267
Now I'm gonna go
through this door!

560
00:22:05,267 --> 00:22:06,667
[all giggling]

561
00:22:06,667 --> 00:22:07,933
Now this one!

562
00:22:07,933 --> 00:22:09,533
Oh, no!
This one!

563
00:22:09,533 --> 00:22:10,467
Oh, my!
