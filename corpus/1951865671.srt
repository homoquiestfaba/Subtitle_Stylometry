secret ninja academies

00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,640
train our future protectors.

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:12,480
Ancient scrolls told of three
who would be chosen above the others.

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,880
Three who would become...

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,280
# Go, Power Rangers!
Go, Ninja Storm! #

6
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,240
# Let's go! #

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,040
# The call is on
Their force is getting strong #

8
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,920
# They'll have to brave the weather #

9
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,320
# Ninja storm!
Stand together #

10
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,680
# The storm will grow
The waters flow #

11
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,600
# Power Ranger
Ninjas, go! #

12
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:38,400
# Power Rangers
Ninja storm is growing #

13
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,760
# It's growing! It's growing! #

14
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,200
# Go, Power Rangers!
Go, Ninja Storm! #

15
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,600
# Let's go! #

16
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,440
# At the speed of the wind, go!
And scream like thunder #

17
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,320
# Go, Power Rangers
Go, Ninja Storm! #

18
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,720
# Let's go, Power Rangers
Go, Ninja Storm! #

19
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,120
# Let's go, Power Rangers
Go, Ninja Storm! #

20
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,480
# Let's go, Power Rangers
Go, Ninja Storm! #

21
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,440
# Let's go! #

22
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,320
( beeping )

23
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,680
( turns off )

24
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,200
( cheering )

25
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,800
- Hey, that was awesome, dude.
- Finally landed the back flip, man.

26
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,720
You wanna hit that new rail?

27
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,640
No, I can't. I gotta get to class.

28
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,000
- Class?
- Never mind, man. Catch you later, bro.

29
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,360
Not bad.

30
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,120
- Lag times are about two seconds off.
- I know, my bike's bugging on that uphill.

31
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,520
- What time is it?
- Five after, why?

32
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,920
Man, I am so busted!

33
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,280
- Dustin, where are you going?
- I'll call you later, okay? I gotta go.

34
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,200
TORI: Where are they?

35
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,600
Come on.

36
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,360
( grunts ) You miss me?

37
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,800
Dream on.

38
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,680
Where is Dustin?
Last, as usual.

39
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,600
Dude.

40
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,520
( door slides )

41
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,400
- 'Bout time.
- What's up, dude?

42
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,200
How can you guys
be late every single time?

43
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,120
I couldn't pull that off if I planned it.

44
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,000
Maybe that's because
you're the reliable one.

45
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,400
What does that mean, "the reliable one?"

46
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,800
In any group there are
different kinds of people.

47
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,640
Totally true, yeah.
Think about the Power Rangers.

48
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,000
Power Rangers?
You've got to be joking.

49
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,840
No. Okay, there's always
the mellow, reflective dude.

50
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,240
Then there's the risk taker.
The adrenaline guy.

51
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:09,600
- That would, of course, be me.
- Yeah, right.

52
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,480
And you, Tori, you're just...
You're the logical one.

53
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,840
You guys have to lay off
the comic books, seriously.

54
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,720
TORI: Power Rangers. Whatever.

55
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,320
This place always creeps me out.

56
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:31,680
- DUSTIN: I heard that, bro.
- TORI: You guys are so lame.

57
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,960
- Dustin, would you come on?
- I'm right here.

58
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,760
- SHANE: Sure is quiet out here.
- DUSTIN: Little too quiet.

59
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,520
Did you see that?

60
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,880
ALL: Ah!

61
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,640
He-ya!

62
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,840
Go!

63
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,920
Ah! Whoa!

64
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,880
DUSTIN: Not good.

65
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,680
( ninjas laugh )

66
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,800
Let go of me, man.

67
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,480
( squawking )

68
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:25,920
SHANE: Oh, man.

69
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,520
- That's enough for today.
- ALL: He-ya!

70
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,800
Tori.

71
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,760
Shane.

72
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,160
Dustin.

73
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,480
I am very disappointed.
I will expect a visit from you,

74
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:52,320
so that we may discuss
your lack of commitment

75
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,720
to your ninja training.

76
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,920
That wasn't so bad, huh?

77
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,640
What? Well, it wasn't.

78
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,280
Tell you what,
you guys can blame it all on me.

79
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,680
TORI: Don't worry, we will.

80
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,960
SENSEI: You have been students at
the Wind Ninja Academy for nearly a year.

81
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:29,280
And yet you fail to see
the importance of punctuality.

82
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:34,080
I would suggest you find a way
to change that before you return tomorrow.

83
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,400
Otherwise, I will have no choice
but to expel you.

84
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,840
Wait, you can't.

85
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,720
You all have great potential.

86
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:47,040
It would be a shame to waste it.
Now, go.

87
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,880
You must have other studies.

88
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,400
( men grunting )

89
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,800
I don't know why
you put up with them.

90
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,720
Well then, Cameron,

91
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:12,480
I suppose that's why I'm the sensei,
and you're the sensei's son.

92
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:16,800
( rumbling )

93
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,640
What's wrong, Dad?

94
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,440
( evil chuckling )

95
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,080
Cool!

96
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,360
Kicked up to 50/50.
That's what I got to learn for my video.

97
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,240
( alarm goes off )

98
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,680
Dustin?

99
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,640
Heads up!

100
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,520
You're not gonna leave me here
to clean up the shop.

101
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,880
Have I ever told you
what a cool boss you are?

102
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,320
Bye, Kelly!

103
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:08,160
( radio ) ...atmospheric disturbances
have the weather service baffled.

104
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,560
- Are we on time?
- We're early.

105
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,960
Hey, they look like they need help.

106
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,880
No way, Tori, we can't.

107
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,760
We can't leave them here.
What if something happens?

108
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,160
If we're late,
something will definitely happen to us.

109
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:23,520
And it won't involve
fun and fabulous prizes.

110
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,360
( thunder )

111
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,640
Lothor.

112
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,000
The dark energy is strong in you.

113
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,920
It's had time to grow.

114
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,800
It has been a while.

115
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,240
Armies take time.

116
00:08:54,720 --> 00:09:00,000
And now is the time for revenge,
Zurgane, proceed.

117
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,440
As you wish, sir.

118
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,680
- It doesn't have to be this way.
- Why would now be any different?

119
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,400
ALL: Huh?

120
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,120
Kelzacs!

121
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,440
Ha, ha ha!

122
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:26,880
He-ya!

123
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:43,680
- Thank you very much.
- No problem. Bye.

124
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,520
Dude, what if his alarm clock didn't go off
and he doesn't even miss us?

125
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,920
He's a ninja master, Dustin.

126
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,800
- They don't oversleep.
- Really?

127
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,720
Ah!

128
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,280
Trash them all!

129
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,200
Now, Choobo!

130
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,600
Good-bye, Wind Ninja Academy!

131
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,480
Ha!

132
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,840
I can't feel a thing.
Where are we, man?

133
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,680
CHOOBO: Up, up, and away!

134
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,040
What's going on?

135
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,960
SHANE: Something's attacking the school!

136
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,800
TORI: Look out!

137
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,640
Whoa!

138
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,160
It's gone!

139
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,560
I don't know,
I'm thinking... earthquake?

140
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,960
When was the last time
you heard of an earthquake

141
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,840
sucking buildings
and people into the sky?

142
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:19,200
MARAH: Kapri, you said once Uncle
captured all the ninja schools,

143
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,080
- we'd divide Earth down the middle!
- KAPRI: No, what I said was,

144
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:26,880
once Earth's under Uncle's control, you'd
get the Arctic Circle and I'd get California.

145
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,720
Kapri, Marah, quiet!
Or I'll banish you back to your parents.

146
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,560
This is why you never
work with family.

147
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,400
BOTH: Sorry, Uncle. Bye-bye!

148
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,280
Now, where was I?

149
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:44,160
The final phase of your plan
to capture Earth, sir.

150
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,080
Of course.

151
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:50,400
Now that the last of the mighty ninja
academies has been silenced,

152
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,320
- the planet is ours!
- ( whispering )

153
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,240
( grunting )

154
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,640
Sir, it seems
there are three students

155
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,480
from the Wind Ninja Academy
still unaccounted for.

156
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,760
Why would I think anything
could be done right the first time?

157
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,640
- General Zurgane!
- Sir?

158
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,000
I want you to make certain
the zone is clear.

159
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,880
I want nothing left standing!
Nothing!

160
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,760
TORI: Who would do something like this?

161
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,640
Are we the only students left?

162
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,360
Who's that?

163
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,800
( grunting )

164
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,720
It's Cam!
Help me get him out.

165
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:35,040
TORI: We've got you, come on.

166
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,840
- ( coughing )
- Cam, are you okay?

167
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,760
Yeah, I'm fine.

168
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,120
ALL: Whoa!

169
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,840
No!

170
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,400
Come on, guys. This way.

171
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,800
Go!

172
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,080
- Cam, what is this place?
- Just follow me.

173
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,200
No way.

174
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,120
TORI: It's amazing.

175
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:25,920
Dude!

176
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,800
Don't ask any questions
because I can't answer them.

177
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,200
What, this is like
some big secret?

178
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,600
Yes, Shane, it's like some big secret.

179
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:37,440
And there are times when
secrets must be revealed, Cam.

180
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,720
Whoa! Hey, uh...

181
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,600
- that big rat sounds just like Sensei.
- Yeah, I know.

182
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,920
Doesn't really look like him, though.
I mean, except for the clothes.

183
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,320
My father is not a rat.
He's a guinea pig.

184
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:58,080
Dude, did he just explain why,
and I like... missed it?

185
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,520
He's stuck.

186
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,960
Stuck?

187
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:05,760
SENSEI: Yes, Shane. Stuck.
Observe.

188
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,720
Whoa-oh!

189
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:12,000
This is Lothor, once a great ninja.

190
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,360
He was banished from the Earth
when his hunger for power

191
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,280
turned him to the dark side.

192
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,680
When our energy fields collided,

193
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,560
I was transformed into
what you see before you.

194
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,440
Now he has returned,
and brought an army

195
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,840
that will do everything
to take our planet for their own.

196
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,760
Unless they are stopped!

197
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,640
Who is gonna be dumb enough
to try and stop them?

198
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:35,520
An excellent quiestion, Dustin.
The morphers, Cam.

199
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,440
Father, you're not serious.

200
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,800
- We have no choice.
- But these guys? I mean, them?

201
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,680
- They're, well, they're...
- We're what?

202
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,080
Yeah, I don't like
the way that sounded.

203
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:49,440
- Do you?
- Actually, dude, I'm kind of lost here.

204
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,400
Now, Cam.

205
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,840
These are your Power Ranger
Wind morphers.

206
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,200
Yeah, right.

207
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:10,560
Yes! See, I knew it, dude!
I was right.

208
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,480
Power Rangers are real!

209
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,840
Whatever.

210
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,280
No way.

211
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:20,160
SENSEI: Dustin, child of the earth,

212
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,080
true to your heart.

213
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:25,920
You will embody the powers
of the Yellow Wind Ranger.

214
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,800
Tori, fluid and graceful
like the water,

215
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,200
you will become the Blue Wind Ranger.

216
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:34,080
Shane, reaching for the stars,

217
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,440
you will command the powers
of the Red Wind Ranger.

218
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,280
From this point, you will be known
as the Wind Power Rangers,

219
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,680
protectors of the earth.

220
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,520
So, what exactly does this thing do?

221
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,440
Where's the switch?

222
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,320
- Does it have any games?
- No, it doesn't have games...

223
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,240
Ladies and gentlemen,

224
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,640
the defenders of the galaxy.

225
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:59,520
Quickly, Lothor's army is attacking.

226
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,960
You must intercept it.

227
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,760
Call on your powers
by saying "Ninja storm, Ranger form!"

228
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,640
Keep your eyes open.

229
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,560
( echoing ) Hey, looking for us?

230
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,440
It's them!

231
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,360
Okay.

232
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,280
Ninja storm...

233
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:20,160
- What is it again?
- Ninja storm, Ranger form.

234
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,600
It's Ranger form!

235
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,960
Dude, watch and learn.

236
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,280
Ninja Storm, Ranger Form!

237
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,040
Power of Earth!

238
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,360
Yeah, baby! Yeah!

239
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:42,720
I guess no one's laughing
at the comic book geek now,

240
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,640
are they?

241
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:47,520
BOTH: Ninja storm, Ranger form, hah!

242
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,800
Power of air!

243
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,040
Power of water!

244
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,880
ALL: He-ya!

245
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,240
Attack!

246
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,640
Wind Rangers, ninja sword!

247
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:12,000
# Go, Power Rangers,
Go, Ninja Storm! Let's go! #

248
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,440
He-ya!

249
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,320
All right, boys.
Step aside.

250
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,720
On your left!

251
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,600
Hyah! It's all in the wrist.

252
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,960
It's also a handy laser blaster.

253
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:29,760
What's wrong? Never seen a girl
in blue Spandex walk on water?

254
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,920
Yeah, it worked!

255
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,800
Ky-ah!

256
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,600
Good job, Dustin!

257
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,480
- Ky-ah!
- Power Rangers?

258
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,840
Nobody told me
there would be Power Rangers.

259
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,280
- Wind!
- Power!

260
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,160
- Rangers!
- You're impressive against our Kelzacs!

261
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,000
But you didn't think that
was all we had, did you?

262
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,920
ALL: Ah!

263
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,280
Guys, check me out!

264
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,600
This is what I call
getting some air.

265
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,480
- We've got you covered.
- On your wing.

266
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,400
I'm going in!

267
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,240
- No, put me down!
- You got it.

268
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,680
I'm afraid of heigh... ah!

269
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,440
- That's it!
- ALL: Hy-ah!

270
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,640
- Hawk blaster, fired up!
- Sonic fin, sound off!

271
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,080
Flying hammer, ready to roar!

272
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,920
Beat this, blue dude!

273
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,360
Ha!

274
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:44,160
Ready for a workout?
And one, and two...

275
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,520
and work those abs!
Work it!

276
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,320
Is it hot out here,
or is it just you?

277
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,640
Let's put 'em together, guys.

278
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,560
# Go, Power Rangers!
Go, Ninja Storm! #

279
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,480
ALL: Storm striker!

280
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,360
Oh, I'm so scared!

281
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,800
- Ready?
- Fire.

282
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,600
Ah!

283
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,520
- Later days!
- Oh, yeah!

284
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,960
Thanks for stopping by.

285
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,840
# Go, Power Rangers!
Go, Ninja Storm! Let's go! #

286
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,280
Yeah.

287
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,480
- That really just happened, right?
- I'm pretty sure it did.

288
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,320
Now, that... was awesome!

289
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,720
Whoo!

290
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,480
See, I told you guys.
I told you there were Power Rangers

291
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,320
and you're like, "No, you comic book geek.
It's an urban legend, man."

292
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:44,640
That wasn't me, that was miss fluid,
graceful water babe over here.

293
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,560
All right, that was me. But...

294
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,480
You did well this time, Rangers.

295
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,800
But understand that there will
be battles in the future.

296
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:57,120
Lothor will not rest until the earth
is completely under his command.

297
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,040
Or until he is destroyed.

298
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:02,880
The future is in your hands,
Power Rangers.
