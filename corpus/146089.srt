1
00:00:14,208 --> 00:00:15,800
Quiet on the set.

2
00:00:17,478 --> 00:00:19,537
Scene one, take ten.
Marker.

3
00:00:26,821 --> 00:00:29,381
And action!

4
00:00:31,625 --> 00:00:33,593
Joel Levison's office.

5
00:00:33,661 --> 00:00:37,222
l'm sorry, he's not in yet.
May l take a message?

6
00:00:37,298 --> 00:00:40,096
- Mr. Levy, l'll tell him you called.
- Never say that.

7
00:00:40,167 --> 00:00:43,500
He's either in conference, in a meeting.
He's always in.

8
00:00:43,571 --> 00:00:45,766
- Who was that?
- Larry Levy.

9
00:00:47,141 --> 00:00:49,632
Was there anything in the trades
this morning?

10
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:53,271
- l don't know. The mail's late.
- Go get them. Now!

11
00:00:53,347 --> 00:00:56,544
l want them back here
before he arrives.

12
00:01:11,499 --> 00:01:15,526
Griffin, hi. Adam Simon.

13
00:01:15,603 --> 00:01:17,969
We weren't supposed to meet
until next week, but--

14
00:01:18,038 --> 00:01:22,099
- l didn't know we were.
- l wanted to plant a seed in your head.

15
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:24,667
- l'm booked up.
- Picture this.

16
00:01:24,745 --> 00:01:27,407
lt's a planet in the far future
with two suns.

17
00:01:27,481 --> 00:01:29,711
- Who plays the sons?
- No, suns. Large solar disks.

18
00:01:29,784 --> 00:01:31,718
Run this idea by Bonnie Sherow.

19
00:01:31,786 --> 00:01:35,187
The pictures they make these days
are all MTV. Cut, cut, cut.

20
00:01:35,256 --> 00:01:38,714
The opening shot of Touch of Evil
was six and a half minutes long.

21
00:01:38,793 --> 00:01:41,284
- Six and a half minutes?
- Three or four, anyway.

22
00:01:41,362 --> 00:01:44,559
He set up the whole picture
with that one tracking shot.

23
00:01:44,632 --> 00:01:47,032
My father was key grip on that shoot.

24
00:01:47,101 --> 00:01:51,299
What about Absolute Beginners?
That was an extraordinary shot.

25
00:01:51,372 --> 00:01:54,637
- Never heard of it.
- lt's an English film.

26
00:01:59,046 --> 00:02:02,140
- A Peligrino, please.
- l've got Calistoga.

27
00:02:02,216 --> 00:02:04,241
- Buck, how are you?
- Good. How you doin'?

28
00:02:04,318 --> 00:02:08,687
- Good. What have you got for me?
- Okay, here it is.

29
00:02:08,756 --> 00:02:11,589
- The Graduate, Part ll.
- Oh, good.

30
00:02:11,659 --> 00:02:14,685
Listen, the three principals
are still with us.

31
00:02:14,762 --> 00:02:20,223
Dustin Hoffman, Anne Bancroft,
Katharine Ross, 25 years later.

32
00:02:20,301 --> 00:02:25,261
And so are the characters,
Ben, Elaine and Mrs. Robinson.

33
00:02:25,339 --> 00:02:27,273
Ben and Elaine are married, still.

34
00:02:27,341 --> 00:02:32,040
They live in a big, spooky house
up in northern California somewhere.

35
00:02:32,112 --> 00:02:35,206
And Mrs. Robinson
lives with them...

36
00:02:35,282 --> 00:02:39,981
her aging mother
who's had a stroke...

37
00:02:40,054 --> 00:02:41,988
so she can't talk.

38
00:02:42,056 --> 00:02:45,617
- Will it be funny?
- lt'll be funny. Dark, weird and funny.

39
00:02:45,693 --> 00:02:49,060
And with a stroke.
Maybe it's not a stroke.

40
00:02:49,129 --> 00:02:51,791
l don't know what it is.
lt's a malady of some sort.

41
00:02:51,866 --> 00:02:55,461
She's up in the bedroom listening
to everything that happens.

42
00:02:55,536 --> 00:02:58,471
They've got a daughter
who's just graduated from college.

43
00:02:58,539 --> 00:03:02,873
Twenty-two, twenty-three-year-old,
like a Julia Roberts.

44
00:03:02,943 --> 00:03:04,968
Excuse me.
What should l do with these scripts?

45
00:03:05,045 --> 00:03:10,381
They go to Bonnie. And find out from
security how Adam Simon got on the lot.

46
00:03:10,451 --> 00:03:14,410
- l want to know.
- Adam Simon? Okay.

47
00:03:14,488 --> 00:03:17,582
Julia Roberts comes home,
their daughter, the graduate.

48
00:03:17,658 --> 00:03:19,489
The new graduate.

49
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,222
Griffin loved it.
He wanted me to run it by you.

50
00:03:22,296 --> 00:03:27,632
- lt's a band of human survivors.
- Write this down for me.

51
00:03:27,701 --> 00:03:30,795
l can't process this.
Write it down for me.

52
00:03:30,871 --> 00:03:33,999
lt's not about words.
You have to visualize.

53
00:03:37,378 --> 00:03:41,474
Jimmy, are you okay?
What happened?

54
00:03:42,816 --> 00:03:46,343
- Are you all right?
- My name's Jimmy Chase.

55
00:03:48,389 --> 00:03:52,052
He came out of nowhere, ran right
in front of the cart. l never saw him.

56
00:03:57,031 --> 00:03:59,329
- That's Adam Simon.
- How you doin', kid?

57
00:04:08,742 --> 00:04:12,109
Rebecca DeMornay.
Actually, you're better looking.

58
00:04:12,179 --> 00:04:15,239
- No, l'm not Rebecca DeMornay.
- You're a dead ringer.

59
00:04:15,316 --> 00:04:17,011
Thank you very much.

60
00:04:17,084 --> 00:04:19,848
Do you know where
Joel Levison's office is?

61
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,753
The head of the studio?

62
00:04:22,823 --> 00:04:24,757
lt's moving.
lt'll rip your heart out.

63
00:04:24,825 --> 00:04:29,694
This is the area where we make decisions
to give a green light to a picture.

64
00:04:29,763 --> 00:04:34,257
We're going to go 17 stories high.
We'll continue to use all Sony products.

65
00:04:34,335 --> 00:04:37,361
Domo arigato to the Sony products.

66
00:04:37,438 --> 00:04:41,966
lf you need someone to eat sashimi
with you, give me a ring.

67
00:04:48,215 --> 00:04:50,513
The traffic from Malibu
was impossible.

68
00:04:50,584 --> 00:04:54,179
- Good morning, Joel.
- Sandy, park the car, please.

69
00:04:54,254 --> 00:04:56,245
Good morning Marty, Annie.

70
00:04:58,392 --> 00:05:03,056
- What are the Japs doing here?
- What's this talk about heads rolling?

71
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:06,258
The bank's putting screws to us.
Goldman's son is coming out from Boston.

72
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:07,766
l don't like it.

73
00:05:07,835 --> 00:05:11,293
Reggie Goldman's a pipsqueak.
You can't be serious.

74
00:05:11,372 --> 00:05:15,604
Some changes are going on here.
That's always the way.

75
00:05:15,676 --> 00:05:18,509
lt happened at Paramount
three years ago.

76
00:05:18,579 --> 00:05:20,672
Columbia's going through it now.

77
00:05:20,748 --> 00:05:23,012
l hear we're looking
to replace Griffin.

78
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:25,415
Griffin? l don't believe it.
With whom?

79
00:05:25,486 --> 00:05:28,887
Burke or Patrick.
Maybe Larry Levy.

80
00:05:28,956 --> 00:05:32,653
l want to know why
the security is lax.

81
00:05:32,726 --> 00:05:35,718
l'll talk to you later.
l'm in the middle of a pitch.

82
00:05:35,796 --> 00:05:37,957
Listen, go ahead.

83
00:05:38,032 --> 00:05:43,334
- lt's a TV star who goes on a safari.
- A TV star in a motion picture?

84
00:05:43,404 --> 00:05:48,341
- A TV star played by a movie star.
- A movie star playing a TV star.

85
00:05:48,409 --> 00:05:52,743
- Michelle, Bette, Lily.
- Dolly Parton would be good.

86
00:05:52,813 --> 00:05:58,080
- l like Goldie.
- Great, because we have a relationship.

87
00:05:58,152 --> 00:06:00,620
Goldie goes to Africa.

88
00:06:00,687 --> 00:06:06,387
- She's found by this tribe.
- Of small people.

89
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:09,327
She's found and they worship her.

90
00:06:09,396 --> 00:06:14,197
lt's like The Gods Must Be Crazy
except the coke bottle is an actress.

91
00:06:14,268 --> 00:06:16,896
Right. lt's Out of Africa
meets Pretty Woman.

92
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:20,531
She has to decide whether to stay
with the TV show...

93
00:06:20,607 --> 00:06:23,098
or save the tribe.

94
00:06:23,177 --> 00:06:26,146
- Where's Griffin Mill's office?
- Right here.

95
00:06:26,213 --> 00:06:29,148
- You're Martin Scorsese!
- No, but l know Harvey Keitel.

96
00:06:29,216 --> 00:06:32,708
l know you do.
l loved Cape Fear.

97
00:06:32,786 --> 00:06:35,482
My old man worked for Hitchcock.

98
00:06:35,556 --> 00:06:37,820
Rope. lt was a masterpiece.

99
00:06:37,891 --> 00:06:40,689
The story wasn't any good.
He shot the whole thing without cuts.

100
00:06:40,761 --> 00:06:42,661
l hate all this 'Cut, cut, cut!'

101
00:06:42,729 --> 00:06:48,224
What about Bertolucci, the great shot
with Winger in Sheltering Sky?

102
00:06:48,302 --> 00:06:50,361
l didn't see it.

103
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:57,767
- l've been here since 8:00.
- l took a chance getting you this job.

104
00:06:57,845 --> 00:07:01,804
- Who were you with?
- l was with Alan Rudolph.

105
00:07:01,882 --> 00:07:06,785
- What were you doing with him?
- He asked me to have coffee.

106
00:07:06,854 --> 00:07:09,414
You're my assistant.
You don't get involved with writers.

107
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:12,391
l wasn't getting involved. l was
listening to this amazing idea he had.

108
00:07:12,459 --> 00:07:14,984
That's interesting.
What's your pitch?

109
00:07:15,062 --> 00:07:18,498
- Does political scare you?
- Political doesn't scare me.

110
00:07:18,565 --> 00:07:21,261
Radical political scares me.
Political political scares me.

111
00:07:21,335 --> 00:07:24,862
This is politely politically radical,
but it's funny.

112
00:07:24,938 --> 00:07:29,238
- lt's a funny political thing.
- And it's a thriller, too, all at once.

113
00:07:29,309 --> 00:07:33,473
-What's the story?
-l want Bruce Willis. l can talk to him.

114
00:07:33,547 --> 00:07:37,005
lt's a story about a bad-guy senator.

115
00:07:37,084 --> 00:07:41,544
He's traveling around the country
on the country's dime, like Sununu did.

116
00:07:41,622 --> 00:07:44,090
lt's a cynical, political
thriller comedy.

117
00:07:44,158 --> 00:07:49,425
But it's got heart in the right spot.
Anyway, he has an accident.

118
00:07:49,496 --> 00:07:54,297
And he becomes clairvoyant,
like a psychic.

119
00:07:54,368 --> 00:07:57,496
So it's a psychic, political,
thriller comedy with a heart.

120
00:07:57,571 --> 00:08:01,905
With a heart, not unlike Ghost
meets Manchurian Candidate.

121
00:08:01,975 --> 00:08:05,502
- Go on, l'm listening.
- He starts reading people's minds.

122
00:08:05,579 --> 00:08:10,175
And when he gets to the President's mind
it's completely blank.

123
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:12,480
- Can l get you anything?
- l'd like a beer, please.

124
00:08:12,553 --> 00:08:15,681
- We don't have beer.
- Red wine, please.

125
00:08:17,357 --> 00:08:22,418
Someone gets killed at the end.
They always do in political thrillers.

126
00:08:22,551 --> 00:08:26,783
- Griffin Mill's office.
- Can you put him on?

127
00:08:26,855 --> 00:08:30,586
- May l ask who's calling?
- l'd like to speak to Griffin Mill.

128
00:08:30,659 --> 00:08:34,857
He's in a meeting right now. l can take
your name and have him get back to you.

129
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:38,297
- Excuse me?
- He'll get back to me?

130
00:08:38,367 --> 00:08:41,803
- Do you know how often l've heard this?
- Who is this?

131
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:44,998
- lf he doesn't get back to me--
- Who was that?

132
00:08:45,073 --> 00:08:48,065
- l don't know. He didn't say.
- What do you mean?

133
00:08:48,143 --> 00:08:53,445
l don't know how you'll cast it. The
lead is a 50-year-old circus performer.

134
00:08:53,515 --> 00:08:55,881
Let me read the coverage.

135
00:08:55,951 --> 00:08:58,044
Are we still having lunch
with Aaron Camp?

136
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:01,214
- What time?
- l made it for 1:00.

137
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:03,724
- Bad day?
- He's having writer's block.

138
00:09:05,794 --> 00:09:10,254
You have a meeting with Hutter and
Frank South this afternoon at 3:00.

139
00:09:10,332 --> 00:09:14,029
l'll be here. Put this morning's
meetings on the computer. Thanks.

140
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:18,230
- Are you going now?
- l'm going to see Levison.

141
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:21,208
Order me a Caesar salad
and a Crystal Geyser.

142
00:09:29,284 --> 00:09:32,651
About 5:00? Thanks, Sandy.

143
00:09:32,721 --> 00:09:35,019
Hi, Sandy.

144
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:38,218
You can't go in there!
He's in a meeting.

145
00:09:39,361 --> 00:09:42,228
lt's all right, Celia.

146
00:09:42,297 --> 00:09:45,926
l don't think you've met Reg Goldman.
You know his father Harvey.

147
00:09:46,001 --> 00:09:49,732
Yes, of course. Hi, Reg.
From the bank in Boston.

148
00:09:49,805 --> 00:09:54,868
- Reg is out here for a few weeks.
- Great. Business or pleasure?

149
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:57,537
A little of both, l hope.

150
00:09:57,613 --> 00:09:59,410
Reg is thinking of producing.

151
00:09:59,481 --> 00:10:01,472
Really?

152
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:03,848
Yeah. Beats work,
doesn't it, Griffin?

153
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:06,285
l'd like to play some tennis.
Do you play tennis?

154
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:08,721
Tennis? No.

155
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:11,452
- l'm too busy.
- l was asking Walter.

156
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:13,859
Do you know Meg Ryan?

157
00:10:13,929 --> 00:10:15,897
ls she seeing somebody?

158
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:19,565
Yeah, Reg. She's married.

159
00:10:20,769 --> 00:10:22,202
Shit.

160
00:10:22,271 --> 00:10:24,933
What about Winona Ryder?

161
00:10:25,007 --> 00:10:29,876
You know, actually,
Walter is the guy to talk to.

162
00:10:29,945 --> 00:10:32,311
Walter's got everybody's number.

163
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:36,477
- Was there anything?
- No. You're real busy.

164
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:39,919
l want that number, goddamn it.
l want that number.

165
00:10:39,988 --> 00:10:43,583
Oh, boy. What about this one?
Has she done anything?

166
00:10:44,726 --> 00:10:46,159
Celia.

167
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:50,555
Griffin, don't ask.

168
00:10:50,632 --> 00:10:55,092
Don't ask, you don't know?
Or don't ask, l don't want to know?

169
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:57,468
Just don't ask.

170
00:10:58,574 --> 00:11:03,341
lf it's Reggie Goldman
you're concerned about, forget it.

171
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:05,903
But be nice to him. He represents
a lot of money to this company.

172
00:11:05,981 --> 00:11:09,041
lt's not Reggie Goldman
l'm worried about.

173
00:11:09,117 --> 00:11:11,677
- lt's Larry Levy.
- Larry Levy?

174
00:11:12,654 --> 00:11:15,088
Larry Levy's at Fox, isn't he?

175
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:19,189
Come on, Celia.

176
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:22,389
There's a call for Celia
on line one.

177
00:11:22,464 --> 00:11:25,900
- Should l be looking for a job?
- Celia, are you there?

178
00:11:25,968 --> 00:11:30,302
Joel Levison's office.
Oh, Brad. Yeah.

179
00:11:30,372 --> 00:11:31,896
What?

180
00:11:31,974 --> 00:11:36,468
No, we couldn't sign Angelica Huston
for that. She's booked for two years.

181
00:11:36,578 --> 00:11:41,174
Like a ghost story,
but it's not like Ghost.

182
00:11:44,653 --> 00:11:46,848
lt's a supernatural thing.

183
00:11:49,324 --> 00:11:52,054
Joel, Griffin Mill.
A friend of Jennifer's.

184
00:11:52,127 --> 00:11:55,255
No. You're Griffin Mill?
Really?

185
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:57,264
Good to see you.
l'm a big fan of yours.

186
00:11:57,332 --> 00:11:59,994
- l have that tie.
- You do?

187
00:12:06,441 --> 00:12:08,568
Did you order for me?

188
00:12:11,013 --> 00:12:14,744
Hi. Lunching with the enemy.

189
00:12:14,816 --> 00:12:16,784
Oh, come on.

190
00:12:16,852 --> 00:12:19,980
So what's this we hear
about Larry Levy?

191
00:12:20,055 --> 00:12:23,718
Larry Levy? lf he had half a brain,
he'd be dangerous.

192
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:28,027
Aaron says he's coming
to the studio.

193
00:12:28,096 --> 00:12:32,760
Aaron says? Why would you believe
anything he says?

194
00:12:32,834 --> 00:12:35,564
He said it with authority.

195
00:12:35,637 --> 00:12:40,404
He's over there with Angelica Huston
and John Cusack.

196
00:12:40,475 --> 00:12:43,569
He's in over his head.
He's gonna drown over there.

197
00:12:44,613 --> 00:12:47,138
He's the golden boy at Fox these days.

198
00:12:47,215 --> 00:12:50,082
Did you see that thing on him
in Variety last week?

199
00:12:50,152 --> 00:12:51,676
Two pages.

200
00:12:51,753 --> 00:12:55,689
Angelica, Griffin Mill.
Good to see you. You're looking great.

201
00:12:55,757 --> 00:12:58,726
Johnny, Griffin Mill.
A big fan of yours.

202
00:12:58,794 --> 00:13:01,854
- You gonna be in Telluride this year?
- Probably in Park City.

203
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:04,125
Great. We'll see you there.

204
00:13:05,767 --> 00:13:11,205
- What's happening with Glass Box?
- Let's not talk about Hollywood.

205
00:13:11,273 --> 00:13:13,833
We're educated people.

206
00:13:18,947 --> 00:13:21,074
l'll call you later.

207
00:13:53,448 --> 00:13:55,916
- Talk to somebody about this.
- What?

208
00:13:55,984 --> 00:13:58,817
- You've gotten 5 postcards in 2 weeks.
- Seven, actually.

209
00:13:58,887 --> 00:14:01,481
Why don't you talk to Studio Security?

210
00:14:01,556 --> 00:14:03,683
l should call Walter Stuckel
and say what?

211
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:08,458
'Someone's sending me poison letters
and l would like for you to make me...

212
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:12,159
the object of more ridicule now that
things are really shaky for me here.(

213
00:14:12,234 --> 00:14:13,667
l don't think so.

214
00:14:13,735 --> 00:14:15,760
l think they're coming from a writer.

215
00:14:15,837 --> 00:14:17,828
- Which one?
- Take your pick.

216
00:14:20,342 --> 00:14:22,708
- ls there anything else?
- Yes, your attorney phoned.

217
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:25,611
He wants you to attend a party
at his house tonight.

218
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,649
- Tell him l'm at a screening.
- Not that attorney. lt's Dick Mellen.

219
00:14:28,717 --> 00:14:30,150
What time?

220
00:14:30,218 --> 00:14:33,187
Cocktails at 7:30, dinner at 8:00.
Bring a date.

221
00:14:33,255 --> 00:14:35,519
And Bonnie Sherow is here to see you.

222
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:38,525
Send her in.
Oh, here she is.

223
00:14:38,593 --> 00:14:41,687
Can we go to the Springs this weekend?

224
00:14:41,763 --> 00:14:46,325
l want to have a massage,
a long soak in a hot tub...

225
00:14:46,401 --> 00:14:49,632
and have Margaritas administered
intravenously.

226
00:14:49,704 --> 00:14:51,934
l have a party at Dick Mellen's.
You want to come?

227
00:14:52,007 --> 00:14:54,567
God, movie stars and power players.

228
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:57,578
- And Vodka.
- Sure.

229
00:14:57,646 --> 00:15:00,843
lt'll be an early dinner,
and we'll go to my place afterwards.

230
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:02,850
- Can we?
- Yeah.

231
00:15:15,354 --> 00:15:19,154
Brokaw looks like he has
absolutely no intensity.

232
00:15:19,224 --> 00:15:21,954
Ted Koppel looks loose,
and he goes after it...

233
00:15:22,027 --> 00:15:24,325
and he digs in.

234
00:15:28,601 --> 00:15:31,126
Hi. How are you?

235
00:15:31,203 --> 00:15:33,501
Marlee, this is Bonnie Sherow.

236
00:15:33,572 --> 00:15:36,370
She read Tales of Fury.

237
00:15:37,476 --> 00:15:40,536
l loved it.
l thought it was wonderful.

238
00:15:40,613 --> 00:15:44,447
l think you're perfect for Ariel.
You're perfect for the part.

239
00:15:45,784 --> 00:15:48,685
We're going to make a couple changes
in the third act.

240
00:15:48,754 --> 00:15:50,745
You should set up a meeting.

241
00:15:52,424 --> 00:15:54,358
Yeah, sure.

242
00:15:54,426 --> 00:15:56,417
- You have my number?
- Absolutely.

243
00:15:57,997 --> 00:16:00,522
Excuse me.
l'm going to say hello to those people.

244
00:16:00,599 --> 00:16:04,296
Don't talk about script changes
at parties.

245
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:08,204
lt was good of you to come.
Don't you look beautiful!

246
00:16:08,273 --> 00:16:11,174
- You know Bonnie Sherow.
- Of course. How are you?

247
00:16:11,243 --> 00:16:14,303
- Tri-Star, right?
- She's at the studio.

248
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:19,682
That's what l meant. Bring Mr. Mill
a martini. And, Bonnie?

249
00:16:19,752 --> 00:16:22,744
- l'll take a Ramlosa.
- l'll have a martini.

250
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:28,025
Rod Steiger's here.

251
00:16:28,093 --> 00:16:30,027
Talk to him about the Rudolph project.

252
00:16:30,095 --> 00:16:34,464
He's not that hot on it,
but see if you can get him to read it.

253
00:16:34,533 --> 00:16:37,263
You know who's here? Harry Belafonte.
Harry?

254
00:16:37,336 --> 00:16:39,964
Come and say hello, will you?

255
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:44,703
- Griffin Mill.
- Hi. Good to see you.

256
00:16:44,777 --> 00:16:47,644
Bonnie Sherow.
She's gaga over you.

257
00:16:47,713 --> 00:16:51,444
l'm a big fan of yours. l saw you accept
the Nelson Mandela Courage Award.

258
00:16:52,751 --> 00:16:56,482
Who was the villain in Ghostbusters?

259
00:16:56,555 --> 00:16:59,422
You got me there.

260
00:16:59,491 --> 00:17:01,516
l got this--

261
00:17:03,529 --> 00:17:08,262
l got this postcard.
Harassment kind of stuff.

262
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:11,097
What are you talking about?

263
00:17:12,838 --> 00:17:15,136
lt's some writer
l must've brushed off.

264
00:17:15,207 --> 00:17:18,404
Get something to eat.
There's lovely stuff over there.

265
00:17:18,477 --> 00:17:20,672
We will in a few minutes.

266
00:17:20,746 --> 00:17:22,441
Your hands are as cold as mine.

267
00:17:22,514 --> 00:17:25,278
Would you like one of these?

268
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:27,511
l don't think l do.

269
00:17:27,586 --> 00:17:30,316
Are you talking about threats?

270
00:17:30,389 --> 00:17:32,949
No. Yes.

271
00:17:33,025 --> 00:17:36,392
l don't know.
He's pissed off.

272
00:17:36,462 --> 00:17:40,831
l thought writers were your long suit.
You're the writer's executive.

273
00:17:40,899 --> 00:17:43,129
Are you pitching me a dream?

274
00:17:43,202 --> 00:17:47,696
- You don't sound sincerely interested.
- lt depends how good the dream is.

275
00:17:49,174 --> 00:17:50,971
Levy's here.

276
00:17:54,379 --> 00:17:59,214
- Dick, what's he doing here?
- Goldblum? He's a friend.

277
00:17:59,284 --> 00:18:02,185
- No, Larry Levy.
- He came with Sally.

278
00:18:02,254 --> 00:18:04,484
What's going on with my job?

279
00:18:04,556 --> 00:18:07,821
Everywhere l look,
Larry Levy is in my face.

280
00:18:07,893 --> 00:18:11,659
Larry Levy is a comer. That's what
comers do, they get in your face.

281
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:14,665
You're a comer, too. You can handle it.
Stop worrying about him.

282
00:18:14,733 --> 00:18:16,860
So the rumors are true?

283
00:18:16,935 --> 00:18:18,869
Rumors are always true.

284
00:18:18,937 --> 00:18:23,431
-l'm always the last to hear about them.
-You're the last one to believe.

285
00:18:23,509 --> 00:18:25,306
Am l out?

286
00:18:25,377 --> 00:18:28,403
You're not out, but you'd better
start thinking about a roommate.

287
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,881
Relax, you can handle this.
You can make it work for you.

288
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:35,750
- Larry?
- Dick. Sorry to crash your party.

289
00:18:35,821 --> 00:18:39,518
- Do you know everybody?
- l will before the night's out.

290
00:18:39,591 --> 00:18:41,616
You will, indeed.

291
00:18:44,463 --> 00:18:48,126
- Great party, Dick.
- Good. Did you get some food?

292
00:18:53,005 --> 00:18:55,030
Listen to this.

293
00:18:55,107 --> 00:18:57,905
'He lifts her dress.
She kisses him harder.

294
00:18:57,976 --> 00:19:01,776
He puts his hands in her underpants.
She grabs his shoulders.

295
00:19:01,847 --> 00:19:06,614
He pulls her dress above her waist.
He rubs against her wide, soft belly.

296
00:19:06,685 --> 00:19:11,247
Slowly he pushes her panties down
to her knees. She's faint with passion.

297
00:19:11,323 --> 00:19:14,520
She arches her back and
he lowers her down onto the buckboard.

298
00:19:14,593 --> 00:19:19,087
The horses snort and whinny.
They, too, feel her passion.

299
00:19:19,164 --> 00:19:21,894
The camera moves in
on the nostrils of the horse...

300
00:19:21,967 --> 00:19:25,300
as the buckboard begins to shake.(

301
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:29,204
God! Do you believe that?
Steve recommended that script.

302
00:19:29,274 --> 00:19:33,108
He says they're hot for it at Universal.
They're gonna have a bidding war.

303
00:19:33,178 --> 00:19:36,705
l heard a pitch today. lt wasn't bad.
Stuck on a story point, though.

304
00:19:36,782 --> 00:19:41,446
- l'm a story editor. Go.
- New York City, big advertising agency.

305
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,648
An account executive makes
a presentation to a potential client.

306
00:19:44,723 --> 00:19:47,191
The client promises
to get back to him.

307
00:19:47,259 --> 00:19:49,784
- Does it have to be advertising?
- That's not the problem.

308
00:19:49,862 --> 00:19:53,696
The account executive keeps waiting
for the client to call him back...

309
00:19:53,765 --> 00:19:57,292
to tell him what he thought
of the idea, if he got the job or not.

310
00:19:57,369 --> 00:19:59,769
But the client never calls.

311
00:19:59,838 --> 00:20:04,707
The account executive gets so pissed off
and frustrated, he becomes obsessive.

312
00:20:04,776 --> 00:20:08,212
- He decides to drive the client crazy.
- What does he do?

313
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:12,808
Sends him threatening postcards.
lt's not important.

314
00:20:12,885 --> 00:20:16,821
Here's the problem.
How long do you think...

315
00:20:16,889 --> 00:20:20,381
the account executive
harasses the client...

316
00:20:20,459 --> 00:20:22,791
before he becomes dangerous?

317
00:20:22,861 --> 00:20:25,887
- Does it have to be advertising?
- How long?

318
00:20:25,964 --> 00:20:28,455
lf it were me--

319
00:20:28,533 --> 00:20:30,228
One month?

320
00:20:30,302 --> 00:20:32,964
Three months.
No, more. Five months.

321
00:20:33,038 --> 00:20:35,871
- To be dangerous, five months.
- That's what l thought.

322
00:20:35,941 --> 00:20:38,102
- Who's the writer?
- l don't know.

323
00:20:38,176 --> 00:20:40,804
You don't know the writer
who pitched you the idea?

324
00:20:40,879 --> 00:20:44,406
l don't know his name.
lt's a couple kids.

325
00:20:45,851 --> 00:20:47,318
TV writers.

326
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:52,813
Can we go to bed now?
l'm starting to wrinkle.

327
00:21:00,265 --> 00:21:02,199
- See you tomorrow afternoon.
- Absolutely.

328
00:21:02,267 --> 00:21:05,134
Burt, Larry Levy. l hope you don't
remember me, and if you do...

329
00:21:05,203 --> 00:21:09,503
l hope there are no hard feelings,
l was working for Gassner then.

330
00:21:14,613 --> 00:21:16,672
Take care.

331
00:21:16,748 --> 00:21:19,478
- Who was that?
- An exec over at Fox.

332
00:21:19,551 --> 00:21:21,644
Was until breakfast, anyway.

333
00:21:30,128 --> 00:21:32,858
- Good morning, Mr. Mill.
- Hi, Susan. How are you?

334
00:21:32,931 --> 00:21:35,559
l'm with Joel.

335
00:21:35,634 --> 00:21:38,728
- Hi, Burt. Griffin Mill.
- Good to see you.

336
00:21:38,804 --> 00:21:41,068
Hi, Charles. How are you?

337
00:21:41,139 --> 00:21:43,630
- Asshole.
- One of a breed.

338
00:21:45,744 --> 00:21:50,204
Actually, he's not. There's a whole
breed of them. They're breeding them.

339
00:21:50,282 --> 00:21:53,149
Joel, you're losing your touch,
scheduling meetings so close together.

340
00:21:53,218 --> 00:21:55,686
That guy didn't have time
to finish his breakfast.

341
00:21:55,754 --> 00:21:58,154
He'd already eaten.
Gets up early.

342
00:21:59,358 --> 00:22:02,691
- You went to Mellen's last night.
- Take this away, please. Yes, l did.

343
00:22:02,761 --> 00:22:06,492
- How is he?
- l'd like a Vitelle water.

344
00:22:06,565 --> 00:22:08,590
He's fine.

345
00:22:08,667 --> 00:22:10,897
You left early. Why?

346
00:22:10,969 --> 00:22:14,803
We had to work
on the museum party.

347
00:22:14,873 --> 00:22:17,671
l will not work for Larry Levy.

348
00:22:17,743 --> 00:22:20,075
l'm not asking you to.

349
00:22:21,346 --> 00:22:24,679
l report to you. lf l have to report
to Larry Levy, l quit.

350
00:22:27,019 --> 00:22:30,511
You can't quit.
l won't let you quit.

351
00:22:30,589 --> 00:22:33,285
You have a year and a half on your
contract. l'll sue you for breach...

352
00:22:33,358 --> 00:22:36,691
if you don't show up in the office
every day, with a smile.

353
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:40,294
Why Levy?

354
00:22:40,365 --> 00:22:42,765
Levy was available.

355
00:22:42,834 --> 00:22:45,268
He's good on material,
you're good with writers.

356
00:22:45,337 --> 00:22:47,965
We're a team. He's a new member
of the team, that's all.

357
00:22:49,107 --> 00:22:51,268
He can make us all look good.

358
00:22:51,343 --> 00:22:54,335
This is a wine glass. Can l have
my water in a water glass, please?

359
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,170
Well?

360
00:22:57,249 --> 00:23:00,309
l'll have to think about it.

361
00:23:00,385 --> 00:23:02,285
l want an answer this afternoon.

362
00:23:02,354 --> 00:23:05,050
l have to go out to Palmdale.

363
00:23:05,123 --> 00:23:08,058
The director of Lonely Room
is giving Lily a hard time.

364
00:23:09,361 --> 00:23:13,058
- l'll be back around 5:00.
- So call after 5:00.

365
00:23:13,131 --> 00:23:15,497
l'll get back to you.

366
00:23:15,567 --> 00:23:19,628
...you haven't died.
See, he's still hanging on.

367
00:23:32,184 --> 00:23:35,517
Griffin, Joel Levison on line 2.
l'll put it through.

368
00:23:35,587 --> 00:23:38,317
- l'll get back to him.
- Tell Joel you'll get back to him?

369
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:41,951
Yeah. l want to hear
what he's got to say.

370
00:23:51,603 --> 00:23:54,731
- How did this get here?
- The mail.

371
00:23:54,806 --> 00:23:57,707
But this does not have a postmark.
This was hand-delivered.

372
00:23:57,776 --> 00:23:59,835
Not to me.
lt came with the mail.

373
00:23:59,911 --> 00:24:01,344
Jimmy?

374
00:24:03,815 --> 00:24:06,875
Do you know anything about this?
Who delivered it? Where it came from?

375
00:24:06,952 --> 00:24:09,318
Mail room?

376
00:24:09,387 --> 00:24:12,083
But l want to know how it got
to the goddamn mail room.

377
00:24:12,157 --> 00:24:14,853
- Find out and get back to me.
- Okay, sure.

378
00:24:14,926 --> 00:24:18,760
- You go with him.
- You want me to go to the mail room?

379
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:21,025
l want you to go to the mail room.
And while you're there...

380
00:24:21,099 --> 00:24:24,500
l would like a copy of
The Lonely Room rewrites...

381
00:24:24,569 --> 00:24:27,265
in white pages,
no color.

382
00:24:27,339 --> 00:24:29,864
- Find out how this got in my mail.
- Yes, sir.

383
00:24:29,941 --> 00:24:33,877
- You'll get your own phones?
- l can get my own phones.

384
00:24:40,619 --> 00:24:42,780
Son of a bitch!
Five months.

385
00:24:42,854 --> 00:24:46,290
One, two, three, four, five.

386
00:24:49,261 --> 00:24:52,025
Richard Fueller.
David Lucas.

387
00:24:55,333 --> 00:24:59,269
Cal Winstrom. David Kahane.
Sammy Tettleton.

388
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:06,577
lncoming.

389
00:25:10,348 --> 00:25:13,840
lncoming. Unreturned calls.

390
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:15,477
Bill Lyndstrom.

391
00:25:16,721 --> 00:25:19,121
Nancy Franklin.
Wouldn't be a woman.

392
00:25:19,191 --> 00:25:21,125
David Kahane.

393
00:25:33,838 --> 00:25:35,465
Lyndstrom.

394
00:25:37,642 --> 00:25:40,076
Strategic Planning.
Wouldn't be him.

395
00:25:40,145 --> 00:25:43,637
What was that other guy's name?

396
00:25:43,715 --> 00:25:45,148
Kahane.

397
00:25:47,419 --> 00:25:51,150
Kaltrime. Kahane.

398
00:25:51,223 --> 00:25:53,183
'Unproduced.'
Gotcha!

399
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,803
- Hello.
- Hello. ls David Kahane there?

400
00:26:53,876 --> 00:26:55,309
David!

401
00:27:03,186 --> 00:27:07,179
l'm sorry. l forgot.
He's gone out. Who's this?

402
00:27:07,257 --> 00:27:10,317
- This is Griffin Mill.
- Oh, the dead man.

403
00:27:10,393 --> 00:27:13,920
- What did you say?
- Oh, nothing.

404
00:27:13,997 --> 00:27:19,629
- About me being a dead man?
- Just a nickname David has for you.

405
00:27:19,702 --> 00:27:23,468
l see.
That's a funny nickname.

406
00:27:23,539 --> 00:27:27,475
l suppose your husband doesn't like me
very much.

407
00:27:27,543 --> 00:27:29,738
l don't have a husband.

408
00:27:29,812 --> 00:27:31,939
l suppose David doesn't like me
very much.

409
00:27:32,015 --> 00:27:34,245
David's gone to the cinema.

410
00:27:34,317 --> 00:27:38,549
- When will he be back?
- When the film's over, l presume.

411
00:27:38,621 --> 00:27:41,317
And you are?

412
00:27:41,391 --> 00:27:44,121
- June.
- June?

413
00:27:44,193 --> 00:27:46,457
Here we go.
You want to know my last name.

414
00:27:46,529 --> 00:27:50,465
- No one can pronounce it.
- Try me.

415
00:27:50,533 --> 00:27:52,023
Gudmundsdottir.

416
00:27:52,101 --> 00:27:53,830
Gudmundsdottir.

417
00:27:57,173 --> 00:27:59,835
- How's that?
- Very good.

418
00:27:59,909 --> 00:28:01,342
Thanks.

419
00:28:02,645 --> 00:28:06,445
- What do people usually say?
- Don't ask.

420
00:28:06,516 --> 00:28:11,579
Anything from Good Dog's Water
to Goulash Wallop.

421
00:28:13,489 --> 00:28:15,821
- You English?
- Yep.

422
00:28:15,892 --> 00:28:18,224
Well, no, not really.

423
00:28:18,294 --> 00:28:21,161
Where are you sort of not from?

424
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:25,189
Do you want the long story
or the short one?

425
00:28:25,268 --> 00:28:27,395
- The long one.
- No, you'd never believe it.

426
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:31,429
- The short one's lceland.
- lceland?

427
00:28:31,507 --> 00:28:34,999
l didn't know anyone came from lceland.
l thought it was just a block of ice.

428
00:28:35,078 --> 00:28:37,444
lt's very green, actually.

429
00:28:37,513 --> 00:28:40,175
Really? l thought that was Greenland.

430
00:28:40,249 --> 00:28:44,845
No, Greenland's very icy.
lceland's very green.

431
00:28:44,921 --> 00:28:48,379
They switched names to fool the Vikings
who tried to steal their women.

432
00:28:48,458 --> 00:28:49,891
l see.

433
00:28:49,959 --> 00:28:52,894
No. Blue sea.

434
00:28:52,962 --> 00:28:54,930
Red sea.

435
00:28:54,997 --> 00:28:58,228
- No red.
- You're a painter.

436
00:28:58,301 --> 00:29:00,269
How did you guess?

437
00:29:01,871 --> 00:29:04,339
What movie did David go to see?

438
00:29:04,407 --> 00:29:08,309
He went to the Rialto in Pasadena.
He always goes there.

439
00:29:08,378 --> 00:29:10,278
What's showing?

440
00:29:10,346 --> 00:29:14,339
Bicycle Thief, l think.

441
00:29:14,417 --> 00:29:16,851
lt's a good movie.
Have you seen it?

442
00:29:18,087 --> 00:29:20,385
l don't go to the movies.

443
00:29:20,456 --> 00:29:21,889
Why not?

444
00:29:29,766 --> 00:29:32,098
Life is too short.

445
00:29:32,168 --> 00:29:34,693
l've got to hang up now.

446
00:30:59,789 --> 00:31:01,723
David Kahane!

447
00:31:01,791 --> 00:31:04,351
You have the wrong guy, man.

448
00:31:25,414 --> 00:31:28,212
David Kahane.
Griffin Mill.

449
00:31:29,819 --> 00:31:31,980
Griffin Mill.

450
00:31:32,054 --> 00:31:33,578
Yeah?

451
00:31:33,656 --> 00:31:35,851
Great movie, huh?

452
00:31:35,925 --> 00:31:39,827
lt's refreshing to see something like
this after all these cop movies...

453
00:31:39,896 --> 00:31:44,390
and, you know,
things we do.

454
00:31:44,467 --> 00:31:47,561
- Maybe we'll do a remake of this.
- You'd probably give it a happy ending.

455
00:31:47,637 --> 00:31:49,662
No, we'd keep it pure.

456
00:31:49,739 --> 00:31:51,673
Pure, right.

457
00:31:51,741 --> 00:31:55,268
- You want to write it?
- Don't fuck with me.

458
00:31:55,344 --> 00:31:57,904
l'm not fucking with you.
Didn't l say l'd get back to you?

459
00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:01,472
Yeah, about six months ago.
l thought you'd forgotten.

460
00:32:01,551 --> 00:32:04,247
You were angry.

461
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,753
Maybe.

462
00:32:05,821 --> 00:32:08,153
Do you want to talk about it?

463
00:32:08,224 --> 00:32:10,749
- Okay, sure.
- Great.

464
00:32:10,826 --> 00:32:14,091
Let's let the studio
buy us a drink.

465
00:32:16,499 --> 00:32:20,492
lf you don't mind a place where you
don't have any suck with the maitre d'.

466
00:32:20,570 --> 00:32:23,164
- l know a bar down the street.
- Let's go.

467
00:32:30,713 --> 00:32:33,273
Have you ever been to Japan?

468
00:32:33,349 --> 00:32:37,547
Yes. l was there once on
a location scout with Steven Spielberg.

469
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:40,054
l lived there for a year.

470
00:32:40,122 --> 00:32:42,283
Student year abroad.

471
00:32:42,358 --> 00:32:45,191
l wish l'd done that.

472
00:32:45,261 --> 00:32:48,594
l think about it a lot.
l'll never forget it.

473
00:32:48,664 --> 00:32:51,189
You should write about it.

474
00:32:51,267 --> 00:32:53,827
l did.
Don't you remember?

475
00:32:55,037 --> 00:32:56,470
What?

476
00:32:58,774 --> 00:33:03,905
My idea about the American student
who goes to Japan.

477
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:07,143
That was my pitch, the one you were
supposed to get back to me on.

478
00:33:07,216 --> 00:33:10,083
- You don't remember, do you?
- Of course l remember.

479
00:33:12,521 --> 00:33:15,149
You never got back to me.

480
00:33:15,224 --> 00:33:17,283
Listen.

481
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:22,491
l was an asshole, all right?
lt comes with the job.

482
00:33:22,565 --> 00:33:24,692
l'm really sorry.

483
00:33:26,969 --> 00:33:30,166
l know how angry you must've been.
l'll make it up to you.

484
00:33:30,239 --> 00:33:31,831
That's why l'm here.

485
00:33:31,907 --> 00:33:35,434
l'm gonna give you a deal, David.

486
00:33:35,511 --> 00:33:39,208
l won't guarantee you l'll make
the movie, but l will give you a shot.

487
00:33:43,085 --> 00:33:47,920
Let's just stop all the postcard shit,
all right?

488
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:50,788
l'm here to say
that l would like...

489
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:52,794
to start over.

490
00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:55,863
Friends.

491
00:33:57,633 --> 00:34:00,363
Fuck you, man.
You're a liar.

492
00:34:00,436 --> 00:34:02,427
You're stepping over the line.

493
00:34:02,505 --> 00:34:04,735
You didn't come here
to see The Bicycle Thief.

494
00:34:04,807 --> 00:34:07,935
You came in five minutes
before the picture ended.

495
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:10,444
Nearly tripped over my feet.

496
00:34:11,814 --> 00:34:13,748
Did you call my house?

497
00:34:15,718 --> 00:34:17,618
Speak to the lce Queen?

498
00:34:19,321 --> 00:34:22,586
You'd like her.
She's a lot like you.

499
00:34:22,658 --> 00:34:24,091
All heart.

500
00:34:30,232 --> 00:34:34,430
You're on my list, pal.
Nothing's gonna change that.

501
00:34:38,307 --> 00:34:41,936
See you in the next reel, asshole.

502
00:35:29,795 --> 00:35:33,731
lt's a nice boat you got there,
movie exec.

503
00:35:33,799 --> 00:35:37,098
lt's me, the writer.
Still want to buy my story?

504
00:35:37,169 --> 00:35:40,696
l told you l'd deal. Stop by the studio.
We'll work something out.

505
00:35:40,773 --> 00:35:43,674
And who will l ask for?

506
00:35:43,742 --> 00:35:45,175
Larry Levy?

507
00:35:47,179 --> 00:35:49,170
What's Larry Levy got to do with this?

508
00:35:50,249 --> 00:35:52,547
- How do you know about Larry Levy?
- Don't you read the trades?

509
00:35:52,618 --> 00:35:55,815
New York Times business section?
He's movin' in, you're movin' out.

510
00:35:55,888 --> 00:35:58,618
You can't make a deal, they say.
Yesterday's news.

511
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:00,624
Wait a minute.

512
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:04,551
Can l borrow your mobile phone?

513
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:08,191
Larry Levy.
Larry, David Kahane here.

514
00:36:08,267 --> 00:36:12,203
Guess who's making promises
about getting pictures made...

515
00:36:12,271 --> 00:36:14,865
to writers in parking lots?

516
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:17,966
Guess what dumb
son of a bitch executive...

517
00:36:18,043 --> 00:36:22,139
is trying to take advantage of me?

518
00:36:22,214 --> 00:36:25,980
Do you realize how unstoppable
this guy is?

519
00:36:26,051 --> 00:36:28,383
You know,
l cannot wait...

520
00:36:28,453 --> 00:36:33,481
to tell the world that when Griffin Mill
can't cut the pressure at work...

521
00:36:33,559 --> 00:36:36,585
he drives out to Pasadena...

522
00:36:36,662 --> 00:36:39,563
to pick fights with writers.

523
00:36:40,899 --> 00:36:42,924
Tell Larry Levy to call me.

524
00:36:43,001 --> 00:36:48,439
The word is out that he's going to start
making meaningful pictures for a change.

525
00:36:48,507 --> 00:36:51,670
Let's forget this.
Just stop all the postcard shit!

526
00:36:51,743 --> 00:36:53,973
l don't write postcards!
l write scripts!

527
00:36:54,046 --> 00:36:57,277
- We're both wrong.
- No, you're wrong, buddy!

528
00:36:57,349 --> 00:37:00,011
You're in over your head.
That's why you're losing your job.

529
00:37:00,085 --> 00:37:02,212
Then what are you gonna do?

530
00:37:03,355 --> 00:37:05,721
l can write.
What can you do?

531
00:37:10,495 --> 00:37:12,725
l said, let's forget this.

532
00:37:17,469 --> 00:37:19,460
Ah, shit.

533
00:37:21,573 --> 00:37:23,768
Mill, you okay?

534
00:37:32,217 --> 00:37:35,050
Keep it to yourself!

535
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:37,714
Keep it to yourself!

536
00:38:03,382 --> 00:38:04,815
Kahane?

537
00:39:25,931 --> 00:39:29,731
That's interesting.
Who's writing this movie?

538
00:39:29,801 --> 00:39:33,328
Who wrote the new ending
to Fatal Attraction? The audience.

539
00:39:33,405 --> 00:39:36,397
A million screenwriters
from the audience wrote that.

540
00:39:36,475 --> 00:39:40,309
Who's to say what it would have done
if you had left the original ending?

541
00:39:40,379 --> 00:39:44,281
You're right, but you can say that it's
done almost 300 million worldwide...

542
00:39:44,349 --> 00:39:46,681
with the new ending.

543
00:39:46,818 --> 00:39:50,447
Larry Levy, l don't believe you've met
my assistant, Whitney Gersh.

544
00:39:50,522 --> 00:39:53,082
- No, l haven't.
- lt's a pleasure to meet you.

545
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:57,922
How's your picture?
lt just tested last week.

546
00:39:57,996 --> 00:40:01,625
lt's doing well.
lt was our first test.

547
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:03,600
Excuse me, Walter.

548
00:40:03,668 --> 00:40:08,071
Joel, Griffin isn't in, but l think
we really have to start this meeting.

549
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:10,404
Okay, Celia. Thank you.

550
00:40:13,111 --> 00:40:15,341
Remember a movie called D.O.A.?

551
00:40:15,414 --> 00:40:17,609
Sure l do.
Eddie O'Brien and Pam Britton.

552
00:40:17,682 --> 00:40:21,174
Disney did a remake in '87 or '88.

553
00:40:21,253 --> 00:40:24,086
l think we've got
pretty much the same situation here.

554
00:40:24,156 --> 00:40:26,624
Keep our noses clean, Walter.

555
00:40:30,095 --> 00:40:32,586
lt's a shame to waste a picture.

556
00:40:32,664 --> 00:40:36,896
Who said we're wasting the picture?
Where did that come from?

557
00:40:36,968 --> 00:40:39,766
You know what's interesting?
We're all too busy--

558
00:40:39,838 --> 00:40:44,707
Griffin, you're really late.
They're waiting inside.

559
00:40:44,776 --> 00:40:48,212
To actually rub shoulders
with the great unwashed?

560
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:51,545
We need to give them
the kind of pictures they want...

561
00:40:51,616 --> 00:40:53,743
not the kind
writers want to give them.

562
00:41:01,093 --> 00:41:04,085
- Hello. Sorry l'm late.
- You certainly are.

563
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:10,330
A few minutes in the office
would be fine.

564
00:41:11,236 --> 00:41:13,636
Griffin, you missed
the formal welcoming ceremony.

565
00:41:13,705 --> 00:41:16,697
You know Larry Levy.

566
00:41:16,775 --> 00:41:18,800
Of course. Hi, Larry.

567
00:41:20,212 --> 00:41:21,645
Hi, Griffin.

568
00:41:21,713 --> 00:41:23,647
Larry was able to leave Fox
a week earlier than he thought...

569
00:41:23,715 --> 00:41:25,842
and has come aboard
as of this morning.

570
00:41:25,917 --> 00:41:30,980
- Great. Let's start.
- Larry was in the middle of something.

571
00:41:31,056 --> 00:41:34,651
No, l wasn't. l was just killing time
waiting for Griffin.

572
00:41:34,726 --> 00:41:37,752
No, finish.
What were you saying?

573
00:41:37,829 --> 00:41:42,266
l was saying l've yet to meet a writer
who could change water into wine...

574
00:41:42,334 --> 00:41:44,825
and we have a tendency
to treat them like that.

575
00:41:45,904 --> 00:41:48,168
Not at this studio.

576
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:52,176
A million and a half of these scripts.
lt's nuts.

577
00:41:52,244 --> 00:41:54,576
And l think avoidable.

578
00:41:54,646 --> 00:41:58,639
Let me ask you. When was the last time
you bought a ticket to see a movie?

579
00:41:58,717 --> 00:42:02,653
- You actually paid your own money?
- Last night.

580
00:42:02,721 --> 00:42:04,916
Pasadena. The Bicycle Thief.

581
00:42:04,990 --> 00:42:08,187
- You saw The Bicycle Thief?
- l love that. lt's a great film.

582
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:11,058
lt's an art movie. lt doesn't count.
We're talking about movie movies.

583
00:42:11,129 --> 00:42:13,063
Jesus, people.

584
00:42:13,131 --> 00:42:16,032
l'm just saying there's time
and money to be saved...

585
00:42:16,101 --> 00:42:18,831
if we came up with these stories
on our own.

586
00:42:18,904 --> 00:42:21,930
- Where are these stories coming from?
- Anywhere. lt doesn't matter.

587
00:42:23,508 --> 00:42:26,375
The newspaper.
Pick any story.

588
00:42:29,614 --> 00:42:32,674
'lmmigrants protest budget cuts
in literacy program.'

589
00:42:32,751 --> 00:42:36,209
Human spirit overcoming human adversity.
Sounds like Horatio Alger in the barrio.

590
00:42:36,288 --> 00:42:39,280
Put Jimmy Smits in it and you've got
a sexy Stand and Deliver.

591
00:42:39,357 --> 00:42:42,724
- Next. Come on.
- This isn't my field.

592
00:42:42,794 --> 00:42:45,524
lt doesn't matter. Give it a shot.
You can't lose here.

593
00:42:48,533 --> 00:42:52,833
How about 'Mud slide kills 60
in slums of Chili'?

594
00:42:52,904 --> 00:42:56,305
That's good. Triumph over tragedy.
Sounds like a John Boorman picture.

595
00:42:56,374 --> 00:42:59,605
Slap a happy ending on it,
the script will write itself.

596
00:42:59,678 --> 00:43:03,273
- Bonnie. Give me the paper.
- l don't know, Larry.

597
00:43:03,348 --> 00:43:05,282
Give it a shot.

598
00:43:06,985 --> 00:43:10,386
'Further bond losses
push Dow down 7.15.'

599
00:43:11,289 --> 00:43:14,053
- l see Connery as Bond.
- That's funny.

600
00:43:14,125 --> 00:43:17,788
lt's a good thing Oliver Stone wasn't
listening to you. Where would we be?

601
00:43:17,862 --> 00:43:22,128
We would have been spared
sitting through Wall Street.

602
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:25,863
- What did Wall Street do worldwide?
- 70, 75, maybe 80.

603
00:43:25,937 --> 00:43:29,168
$80 million,
a couple Oscars.

604
00:43:29,241 --> 00:43:33,268
l think Larry's point is well taken.
Let's move on.

605
00:43:33,345 --> 00:43:36,837
Can you give us an update
on the Taylor-Hackford project?

606
00:43:36,915 --> 00:43:38,906
Griffin?

607
00:43:38,984 --> 00:43:40,417
Yeah.

608
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:44,245
l was thinking what
an interesting concept it is...

609
00:43:44,322 --> 00:43:48,622
to eliminate the writer
from the artistic process.

610
00:43:49,561 --> 00:43:54,464
lf we can get rid of the actors and
directors, maybe we've got something.

611
00:43:59,893 --> 00:44:01,326
Hello, Walter.

612
00:44:01,395 --> 00:44:03,693
Make yourself at home.

613
00:44:03,764 --> 00:44:07,495
Mr. Mill, l understand you were late
coming in this morning.

614
00:44:07,567 --> 00:44:09,797
You all right?

615
00:44:09,870 --> 00:44:11,497
l'm fine.

616
00:44:11,571 --> 00:44:13,698
l appreciate your concern.

617
00:44:15,108 --> 00:44:17,508
What can l do for you?

618
00:44:17,577 --> 00:44:21,274
Don't tell me you came here
to pitch me a story?

619
00:44:21,348 --> 00:44:23,748
That's exactly what l've come to do.

620
00:44:23,817 --> 00:44:26,877
lt's a good one, too.
lt's about a writer, sort of.

621
00:44:26,954 --> 00:44:28,387
David Kahane.

622
00:44:31,258 --> 00:44:33,658
Who's David Kahane?

623
00:44:33,727 --> 00:44:37,322
- You met him.
- l meet a lot of writers.

624
00:44:37,397 --> 00:44:42,960
But this writer was murdered last night
in back of the Rialto Theater.

625
00:44:43,036 --> 00:44:44,526
Murdered?

626
00:44:44,604 --> 00:44:48,665
Come to think of it, Pasadena's
as good a place to die as any.

627
00:44:50,043 --> 00:44:51,977
What's the story?

628
00:44:52,045 --> 00:44:56,106
ln 25 words or less?
Okay.

629
00:44:56,183 --> 00:44:59,016
Movie exec calls writer.
Girlfriend says he's at the movies.

630
00:44:59,086 --> 00:45:02,419
Exec goes to movies, meets writer,
drinks with writer.

631
00:45:02,489 --> 00:45:06,050
Writer gets conked and dies
in 4 inches of dirty water.

632
00:45:06,126 --> 00:45:08,424
Movie exec is in deep shit.

633
00:45:09,563 --> 00:45:11,531
What do you think?

634
00:45:11,598 --> 00:45:15,090
That's more than 25 words.
And it's bullshit.

635
00:45:15,168 --> 00:45:19,070
Pasadena homicide doesn't think so.
They've got a complete report.

636
00:45:20,107 --> 00:45:24,373
You met Kahane at the Rialto,
got drunk with him. He left before you.

637
00:45:24,444 --> 00:45:27,743
That's the last time anyone
saw him alive, except you, maybe.

638
00:45:28,949 --> 00:45:31,782
Why are you denying this?

639
00:45:31,852 --> 00:45:35,253
Well, what do the police think?

640
00:45:35,322 --> 00:45:38,086
They think it's a botched robbery.

641
00:45:39,893 --> 00:45:44,887
The window of his car was busted.
He surprised someone taking the radio.

642
00:45:44,965 --> 00:45:47,229
There was a fight, he was killed.

643
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:50,269
l didn't kill him, Walter.

644
00:45:50,337 --> 00:45:54,899
But l went to see him.
l know l said l didn't, but l did.

645
00:45:54,975 --> 00:45:57,034
Why'd you lie to me?

646
00:45:58,912 --> 00:46:01,278
Now's not a very good time for me.

647
00:46:01,348 --> 00:46:04,875
Haven't you heard the rumors?
l'm on my way out.

648
00:46:04,951 --> 00:46:07,442
Just what l need,
a little more controversy.

649
00:46:07,521 --> 00:46:09,455
lt's not a good time.

650
00:46:10,857 --> 00:46:13,155
Look.

651
00:46:13,226 --> 00:46:16,821
l'm in charge of studio security
in every definition of the word.

652
00:46:16,897 --> 00:46:22,460
Which means it is my job to take care
of a studio executive should he be...

653
00:46:22,536 --> 00:46:25,801
under suspicion of murder
at a time when profits are down...

654
00:46:25,872 --> 00:46:28,272
and the company is vulnerable
for a takeover.

655
00:46:28,341 --> 00:46:31,504
lt is my job to keep this
very, very quiet!

656
00:46:32,913 --> 00:46:35,006
Do you want to help?

657
00:46:35,082 --> 00:46:37,949
- Of course.
- Then stop lying.

658
00:46:38,018 --> 00:46:40,612
- How many times did you meet with him?
- Once.

659
00:46:41,822 --> 00:46:44,347
- Not counting last night.
- Not counting last night.

660
00:46:44,424 --> 00:46:46,688
Why'd you go all the way to Pasadena
to meet him?

661
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:49,695
He had an idea l was interested in.
l wanted to talk to him right away.

662
00:46:49,763 --> 00:46:54,564
Was his girlfriend a friend, too?
Think fast.

663
00:46:54,634 --> 00:46:57,262
Jesus Christ, Walter.
What is this?

664
00:46:57,337 --> 00:47:00,500
The third degree. Wait until the police
start asking questions.

665
00:47:00,574 --> 00:47:04,032
l'll go to the police now.
You come with me.

666
00:47:04,111 --> 00:47:06,443
You're acting like someone
who's guilty.

667
00:47:06,513 --> 00:47:08,481
You're not guilty, are you?

668
00:47:08,548 --> 00:47:10,778
l'm not a murderer.

669
00:47:28,001 --> 00:47:30,026
Bad news?

670
00:47:30,103 --> 00:47:31,536
What?

671
00:47:31,605 --> 00:47:34,506
The fax.
ls it bad news?

672
00:47:36,977 --> 00:47:38,569
Business as usual.

673
00:47:40,247 --> 00:47:44,013
The Hollywood system
did not murder David Kahane.

674
00:47:44,084 --> 00:47:47,247
Not the $98 million movie,
not the $12 million actor.

675
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:52,952
Not even the million dollar deal
that David Kahane never landed.

676
00:47:53,026 --> 00:47:56,120
The most that we can pin on Hollywood...

677
00:47:56,196 --> 00:47:59,654
is assault with intent to kill.

678
00:47:59,733 --> 00:48:04,534
Because society is responsible
for this particular murder.

679
00:48:04,604 --> 00:48:06,731
lt is to society we must look...

680
00:48:06,806 --> 00:48:10,537
if we are to have justice
for that crime.

681
00:48:10,610 --> 00:48:13,340
Because someone in the night...

682
00:48:13,413 --> 00:48:15,608
killed David Kahane.

683
00:48:15,682 --> 00:48:18,116
And that person
will have to bear the guilt.

684
00:48:19,653 --> 00:48:22,053
And if David were here now...

685
00:48:22,122 --> 00:48:24,647
l know in my heart
that he would say...

686
00:48:26,092 --> 00:48:28,993
'Cut the shit, Phil.

687
00:48:29,062 --> 00:48:33,021
What did you learn from this?
Did you learn anything from this?(

688
00:48:33,099 --> 00:48:36,193
And l'd say, 'Yeah, David,
l've learned a lot.

689
00:48:36,269 --> 00:48:39,204
We here will take it from here.

690
00:48:39,272 --> 00:48:43,572
And the next time we sell a script
for a million dollars...

691
00:48:43,643 --> 00:48:46,976
and nail some shit-bag producer
to the wall, we'll say...

692
00:48:47,047 --> 00:48:49,515
That's another one for David Kahane.(

693
00:48:53,153 --> 00:48:57,021
David was working on something the day
he died. l'd like to share it with you.

694
00:48:58,391 --> 00:49:01,383
'Blackness.
A mangy dog barks.

695
00:49:01,461 --> 00:49:04,760
Garbage can lids are lifted
as derelicts in the street...

696
00:49:04,831 --> 00:49:07,299
hunt for food.

697
00:49:07,367 --> 00:49:09,801
Buzzing, as a cheap alarm clock
goes off.

698
00:49:09,869 --> 00:49:13,566
lnterior. Flophouse room.
Early morning.

699
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:16,768
A tracking shot moves
through the grimy room.

700
00:49:16,843 --> 00:49:20,438
Light streams in through holes
in yellowing window shades.

701
00:49:20,513 --> 00:49:23,175
Moths dance
in the beams of light.

702
00:49:23,250 --> 00:49:26,583
Track down along the floor.
The frayed rug.

703
00:49:26,653 --> 00:49:29,588
Stop on an old shoe.

704
00:49:29,656 --> 00:49:31,351
lt's empty.(

705
00:49:35,595 --> 00:49:37,688
That's as far as he got.

706
00:49:39,065 --> 00:49:41,533
That's the last thing he wrote.

707
00:49:42,402 --> 00:49:44,597
So long, Dave.

708
00:49:44,671 --> 00:49:46,866
Fade out.

709
00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:48,373
Thank you.

710
00:50:04,691 --> 00:50:07,182
Who are you?
You're not a writer.

711
00:50:08,928 --> 00:50:11,260
No, l'm Griffin Mill.

712
00:50:11,331 --> 00:50:13,265
We spoke the night David--

713
00:50:13,333 --> 00:50:16,166
Blue sea, white sea.
Yes.

714
00:50:16,236 --> 00:50:18,534
- lt turned out you were right.
- What?

715
00:50:18,605 --> 00:50:21,039
lt was a red sea.

716
00:50:21,107 --> 00:50:22,870
Oh, yeah.

717
00:50:25,312 --> 00:50:28,475
You're the only person l know here.

718
00:50:28,548 --> 00:50:31,415
l'm really sorry about David.

719
00:50:31,484 --> 00:50:34,578
He was a talent.

720
00:50:35,755 --> 00:50:37,950
You really think so?

721
00:50:38,024 --> 00:50:41,289
l always suspected he was...

722
00:50:41,361 --> 00:50:44,023
uniquely untalented.

723
00:50:45,565 --> 00:50:48,728
lt's nice of you to say that. lt was
nice of you to come. You didn't have to.

724
00:50:48,802 --> 00:50:50,235
l did.

725
00:50:50,303 --> 00:50:54,831
You know, l was probably the last person
to see him alive.

726
00:50:54,908 --> 00:50:57,206
The police told me.

727
00:50:57,277 --> 00:50:59,404
Not quite the last, surely.

728
00:51:02,549 --> 00:51:05,780
l'm sure this is a terrible time
for you.

729
00:51:05,852 --> 00:51:08,184
ls there anything you need?

730
00:51:08,254 --> 00:51:12,953
No, really.
l don't feel bad.

731
00:51:13,026 --> 00:51:15,893
lt's like when my parents died.

732
00:51:15,962 --> 00:51:19,489
l didn't feel anything at all.
They were just gone.

733
00:51:21,201 --> 00:51:24,432
l'm sure it hasn't sunk in yet.

734
00:51:24,504 --> 00:51:26,233
That was years ago.

735
00:51:26,306 --> 00:51:29,070
No, l meant David.

736
00:51:29,142 --> 00:51:31,007
Oh, God.

737
00:51:31,077 --> 00:51:34,103
These people.
l don't like it here.

738
00:51:34,180 --> 00:51:37,775
They're all expecting me
to grieve and mourn.

739
00:51:37,851 --> 00:51:40,149
l can't talk to them.

740
00:51:41,888 --> 00:51:47,019
David's gone and
l'm somewhere else already.

741
00:51:47,093 --> 00:51:49,926
- Will you take me home?
- What?

742
00:51:49,996 --> 00:51:52,726
Will you take me home?

743
00:51:52,799 --> 00:51:55,563
Sure. l'm right here.

744
00:52:32,557 --> 00:52:35,185
These are very interesting.
l like them.

745
00:52:35,260 --> 00:52:38,923
- Would you like a drink?
- No, thanks.

746
00:52:38,997 --> 00:52:42,933
Where do you show?
What gallery? Who's your dealer?

747
00:52:43,001 --> 00:52:45,435
l don't have a dealer.

748
00:52:45,503 --> 00:52:48,472
l couldn't sell these.
They're never finished. Biccy?

749
00:52:50,041 --> 00:52:53,010
No, thanks.
They're never finished?

750
00:52:53,077 --> 00:52:57,537
No, they're just what l do
for myself.

751
00:52:57,615 --> 00:53:00,140
What l feel.

752
00:53:00,218 --> 00:53:02,880
You ask lots of questions, Mr. Mill.

753
00:53:02,954 --> 00:53:06,720
Just like the police.
That's all they did, ask questions.

754
00:53:08,426 --> 00:53:10,360
They asked me a lot about you.

755
00:53:10,428 --> 00:53:12,157
Did they?

756
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:14,164
How long we'd known each other.

757
00:53:14,232 --> 00:53:16,257
lf you'd ever been
to the house before.

758
00:53:16,334 --> 00:53:21,169
- They have to ask those questions.
- l don't see why.

759
00:53:21,239 --> 00:53:23,503
Because that's what police do.

760
00:53:24,542 --> 00:53:27,705
- Can l ask you a question?
- Sure.

761
00:53:27,779 --> 00:53:30,543
Why was it so important
to see David that night?

762
00:53:30,615 --> 00:53:32,708
What was so urgent?

763
00:53:34,385 --> 00:53:37,252
He pitched me a story
a few months ago.

764
00:53:37,322 --> 00:53:39,654
- The Japan story?
- Yes, the Japan story.

765
00:53:39,724 --> 00:53:43,251
l liked it but it needed work,
especially the ending.

766
00:53:43,328 --> 00:53:46,161
l was sitting in my office...

767
00:53:46,230 --> 00:53:49,199
and it suddenly occurred to me
how to make the ending work.

768
00:53:49,267 --> 00:53:51,394
So what was it?

769
00:53:51,469 --> 00:53:52,902
What?

770
00:53:52,970 --> 00:53:55,962
Your idea for the ending.

771
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:58,031
Up.

772
00:53:58,109 --> 00:54:00,270
Up? What does that mean?

773
00:54:00,345 --> 00:54:03,109
As opposed to down. Moods.

774
00:54:03,181 --> 00:54:06,378
You know, happy as opposed to sad.
Hopeful as opposed to depressing.

775
00:54:06,451 --> 00:54:10,114
- What did you think of his ending?
- l never read it.

776
00:54:12,056 --> 00:54:14,684
- You never read it?
- Nope.

777
00:54:14,759 --> 00:54:17,193
l don't like reading.

778
00:54:17,261 --> 00:54:22,426
- Do you like books?
- l like words and letters.

779
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:24,764
But l'm not crazy
about complete sentences.

780
00:54:26,537 --> 00:54:29,028
What did he think?

781
00:54:29,107 --> 00:54:32,873
He walked out on me.
l don't think David liked me.

782
00:54:32,944 --> 00:54:36,880
l think he just didn't like
happy endings.

783
00:54:40,618 --> 00:54:42,779
Put your face here.

784
00:54:44,322 --> 00:54:45,755
Great.

785
00:54:47,925 --> 00:54:50,519
What are you doing?
You aren't going to paint me, are you?

786
00:54:50,595 --> 00:54:53,826
l might put you
in one of my paintings.

787
00:54:53,898 --> 00:54:57,561
There's one l want to do
of an lcelandic hero.

788
00:54:57,635 --> 00:55:00,627
He's a thief
and he's made of fire.

789
00:55:00,705 --> 00:55:03,265
- You might not like that.
- Why not?

790
00:55:03,341 --> 00:55:06,071
Because you're in the movies...

791
00:55:06,144 --> 00:55:10,080
and in movies you can't have thieves
as heroes, can you?

792
00:55:10,148 --> 00:55:13,743
l don't know about that. We have a long
tradition of gangsters in movies.

793
00:55:13,818 --> 00:55:17,515
Yes, but they always have to suffer
for their crimes, don't they?

794
00:55:19,123 --> 00:55:21,284
We should pay for our crimes,
shouldn't we?

795
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:25,693
l think knowing you've committed a crime
is suffering enough.

796
00:55:25,763 --> 00:55:27,754
lf you don't suffer...

797
00:55:27,832 --> 00:55:31,529
maybe it wasn't a crime after all.

798
00:55:31,602 --> 00:55:34,127
Anyway, what difference does it make?

799
00:55:34,205 --> 00:55:37,470
lt has nothing to do
with how things really are.

800
00:55:41,813 --> 00:55:44,475
Do you really believe that?

801
00:55:44,549 --> 00:55:47,950
l don't know what l believe, Mr. Mill.

802
00:55:48,019 --> 00:55:50,817
lt's just what l feel.

803
00:55:52,490 --> 00:55:56,290
You know what you are,
June whatever-your-name-is?

804
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:58,021
A pragmatic anarchist.

805
00:55:59,464 --> 00:56:01,432
ls that what l am?

806
00:56:01,499 --> 00:56:03,626
l never was sure.

807
00:56:08,105 --> 00:56:10,539
Can l just pick this up?

808
00:56:11,809 --> 00:56:14,573
- Oh, it's heavy.
- Thirty-seven ounces.

809
00:56:14,645 --> 00:56:17,113
Really? Look.

810
00:56:17,181 --> 00:56:21,379
l want to thank my mother, her mother
and her father's mother who--

811
00:56:23,387 --> 00:56:24,820
Hello.

812
00:56:26,257 --> 00:56:29,784
- Meet Detective Susan Avery.
- How do you do? My partner.

813
00:56:29,861 --> 00:56:32,955
- Willa Broom.
- My pleasure. Let's go in here.

814
00:56:33,030 --> 00:56:35,863
This is the first real movie studio
Detective Avery's been to.

815
00:56:35,933 --> 00:56:38,959
- Really?
- Aside from the Universal Tour.

816
00:56:39,036 --> 00:56:41,630
l always take my family there
when they come.

817
00:56:41,706 --> 00:56:45,233
l've been there so often,
l feel like l'm ready to direct.

818
00:56:45,309 --> 00:56:49,837
You'd probably do better
than the film grads these days.

819
00:56:49,914 --> 00:56:52,576
l'm sorry l didn't call you
when l heard Kahane was dead.

820
00:56:52,650 --> 00:56:54,311
- Heard or read?
- Read.

821
00:56:54,385 --> 00:56:57,843
- Why didn't you?
- Walter asked me the same question.

822
00:56:57,922 --> 00:57:01,949
l wish l had a better answer. All
l can say is l didn't think about it.

823
00:57:04,462 --> 00:57:06,555
How did you know where
he was gonna be?

824
00:57:06,631 --> 00:57:09,964
- His wife told me--
- Girlfriend.

825
00:57:10,968 --> 00:57:12,401
Girlfriend.

826
00:57:12,470 --> 00:57:14,665
Girlfriend.
l didn't know either of them.

827
00:57:14,739 --> 00:57:17,105
l was restless,
thought l'd see the movie.

828
00:57:17,174 --> 00:57:20,575
lf he was there, l'd talk to him
about a job l thought he was good for.

829
00:57:20,645 --> 00:57:22,806
You got to the theater,
saw him and?

830
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:25,542
We had a drink at a Japanese place.

831
00:57:25,616 --> 00:57:29,484
lt was a wild, incredible scene.
lt was like Tokyo.

832
00:57:29,554 --> 00:57:32,421
He left before you.
Why didn't you leave together?

833
00:57:32,490 --> 00:57:35,118
lt was an incredible scene.
l was having a great time.

834
00:57:35,192 --> 00:57:37,057
Why didn't you stay longer?

835
00:57:37,128 --> 00:57:41,326
People stopped singing. Then it was just
a bar and l don't drink.

836
00:57:41,399 --> 00:57:44,334
- You drank with him.
- When in Rome--

837
00:57:44,402 --> 00:57:48,395
Did you know him socially?
Been to his house?

838
00:57:48,472 --> 00:57:50,497
Know anything about him personally?

839
00:57:52,410 --> 00:57:55,345
We'll let you get back to work now.

840
00:57:57,915 --> 00:57:59,906
What's bothering you?

841
00:57:59,984 --> 00:58:02,851
Well, l just have to ask.

842
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:06,754
Did you see him in the parking lot
after you left?

843
00:58:06,824 --> 00:58:10,419
No, l parked on the street.
l drive a Range Rover...

844
00:58:10,494 --> 00:58:12,928
so l feel safer
when it's visible.

845
00:58:12,997 --> 00:58:15,625
Who's gonna smash a window
if it's on the street?

846
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:19,158
lf you had a shitty car,
you would've parked in the parking lot?

847
00:58:19,236 --> 00:58:22,137
lf l had a shitty car,
l might be a dead man.

848
00:58:22,206 --> 00:58:25,573
Somehow l think you're too lucky
for that.

849
00:58:25,643 --> 00:58:27,508
Thank you.

850
00:58:27,578 --> 00:58:30,376
Okay, 63, take three. Marker.

851
00:58:31,349 --> 00:58:33,783
Now.

852
00:58:33,851 --> 00:58:35,512
Action!

853
00:58:36,821 --> 00:58:41,087
No, goddamn it, you listen to me!
l've been around a while. l got a nose.

854
00:58:41,158 --> 00:58:44,924
This situation stinks.
lt stinks of the company.

855
00:58:44,996 --> 00:58:48,830
That's right, Peterson,
the fucking ClA. Ever heard of it?

856
00:58:48,899 --> 00:58:51,197
lt's the kind of operation--

857
00:58:51,268 --> 00:58:54,362
You don't understand what he's trying
to go for here.

858
00:58:54,438 --> 00:58:57,373
lt's hard to listen to your argument
when you don't understand.

859
00:58:57,441 --> 00:59:01,901
- Would you shut up, please?
- Kiss my ass!

860
00:59:01,979 --> 00:59:04,311
l have to cut.
My robe cut on the drawer.

861
00:59:04,382 --> 00:59:08,716
- For Christ's sakes!
- l like this guy. He's great.

862
00:59:08,786 --> 00:59:13,689
Waters?
Can l have some Volvic, please?

863
00:59:13,758 --> 00:59:15,783
Yeah, he's great.

864
00:59:17,194 --> 00:59:20,254
l heard the police came to see you
about this dead writer.

865
00:59:20,331 --> 00:59:23,994
- Who was this guy?
- His name was David Kahane.

866
00:59:24,068 --> 00:59:27,094
l never heard of him.
We ever hire him for anything?

867
00:59:27,171 --> 00:59:30,140
l was thinking about it.

868
00:59:30,207 --> 00:59:33,973
He pitched me a story.
l went there to talk to him about it.

869
00:59:34,045 --> 00:59:34,943
Jesus. Poor bastard. Just when his ship
comes in, some bastard blasts him--

870
00:59:34,979 --> 00:59:39,609
Jesus. Poor bastard. Just when his ship
comes in, some bastard blasts him--

871
00:59:39,684 --> 00:59:42,312
l don't want to criticize you...

872
00:59:42,386 --> 00:59:45,412
but l'm supposed to be talking
on the phone.

873
00:59:45,489 --> 00:59:47,354
Are the cops still bothering you?

874
00:59:47,425 --> 00:59:51,919
- No. No, l don't think so.
- Let Stuckel handle it.

875
00:59:51,996 --> 00:59:56,126
We'll give them passes to a screening.
They can sit behind Michelle Pfeiffer.

876
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:58,395
They'll leave you alone.

877
00:59:59,670 --> 01:00:03,299
A guy named Joe Gillis called.

878
01:00:03,374 --> 01:00:08,038
He wants you to meet him at the
St. James Club at 10:00 on the patio.

879
01:00:08,112 --> 01:00:12,105
- Never heard of him.
- He said you'd know him.

880
01:00:12,183 --> 01:00:14,174
Anybody know who Joe Gillis is?

881
01:00:14,251 --> 01:00:16,947
He's a character William Holden played
in Sunset Boulevard.

882
01:00:17,021 --> 01:00:21,287
- The writer killed by a movie star.
- Gloria Swanson.

883
01:00:25,730 --> 01:00:29,496
Oh, that guy. Last week he said
he was Charles Foster Kane.

884
01:00:29,567 --> 01:00:32,365
A week before that
it was Rhett Butler.

885
01:00:32,436 --> 01:00:35,769
Why would they think l would kill
my own sister's husband?

886
01:00:37,541 --> 01:00:39,705
l was in love with him.

887
01:01:20,779 --> 01:01:25,512
- Griffin? Griffin.
- Malcolm McDowell, good to see you.

888
01:01:25,584 --> 01:01:29,145
Listen. The next time
you want to badmouth me...

889
01:01:29,221 --> 01:01:31,655
have the courage
to do it to my face.

890
01:01:31,723 --> 01:01:34,191
You guys are all the same.

891
01:01:44,536 --> 01:01:46,834
- You love it there?
- l love it. lt's wonderful.

892
01:01:46,905 --> 01:01:49,271
You love your career, don't you?
What is it?

893
01:01:49,341 --> 01:01:53,368
lt was a complete disaster.
Look what happened in Heaven's Gate.

894
01:01:53,445 --> 01:01:54,639
We both are concerned...

895
01:01:54,713 --> 01:01:57,045
about your career.

896
01:01:57,115 --> 01:01:59,811
Where l live, l know how people
think and feel.

897
01:02:00,986 --> 01:02:05,184
Montana will end you.
lt ended Cimino in Heaven's Gate.

898
01:02:05,257 --> 01:02:09,353
- Griffin Mill, hi. Andy Civella.
- Andy, how are you?

899
01:02:09,427 --> 01:02:13,090
l've got Andie MacDowell sitting over
here. You know her. She's so hot.

900
01:02:13,165 --> 01:02:15,429
- Come over and meet her.
- Still living in New York?

901
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:18,492
l couldn't live here.
l'm allergic to happiness.

902
01:02:18,570 --> 01:02:22,506
Andie, it's good to see you again.
How are the kids?

903
01:02:22,574 --> 01:02:25,008
Great, thanks.
He's wonderful, thank you.

904
01:02:26,344 --> 01:02:28,710
You geniuses know each other.
Tom Oakley.

905
01:02:28,780 --> 01:02:31,840
- Yes, Hi, Tom.
- How are you?

906
01:02:31,917 --> 01:02:35,011
- Funny. l just saw Malcolm McDowell.
- Really?

907
01:02:35,086 --> 01:02:38,419
Roddy McDowall is related
to a cousin of my brother-in-law.

908
01:02:38,490 --> 01:02:41,186
Well, l'm not related
to either one of them.

909
01:02:51,203 --> 01:02:53,194
lf l write it, l direct it.

910
01:02:53,271 --> 01:02:56,707
The last three pictures you directed
were bombs!

911
01:02:56,775 --> 01:03:00,108
Thank you for the drink.
l've got to go.

912
01:03:00,178 --> 01:03:03,807
You've got to go?
We'll walk you to the car.

913
01:03:03,882 --> 01:03:06,316
No, it's okay.
Don't worry about it.

914
01:03:06,384 --> 01:03:08,909
We'd like to buy you a drink.

915
01:03:08,987 --> 01:03:11,979
l can't. l'm meeting someone.
Business.

916
01:03:12,057 --> 01:03:15,220
-We should tell him about Habeas Corpus.
-Of course, but he's a busy man.

917
01:03:15,293 --> 01:03:18,387
- ls there anyone waiting for me?
- No one's asked.

918
01:03:18,463 --> 01:03:22,126
l'm expecting someone.
l'll be out by the pool.

919
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:25,135
But he'll get back to us.
Right, Griffin?

920
01:04:00,805 --> 01:04:02,238
Oh, sorry.

921
01:04:02,307 --> 01:04:04,969
- Jesus, Andy, it's you.
- Of course it's me.

922
01:04:05,043 --> 01:04:08,410
l can't ask you to join me.
l told you. l'm meeting somebody.

923
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:11,313
Yeah. You're meeting me.
We got some big business.

924
01:04:11,383 --> 01:04:12,975
You? You?

925
01:04:13,051 --> 01:04:16,817
- Why not me?
- You think this is fucking funny?

926
01:04:16,888 --> 01:04:18,822
What are you talking about?

927
01:04:18,890 --> 01:04:23,520
Wouldn't she make a great Nora? l'd love
to write another Doll's House for her.

928
01:04:23,595 --> 01:04:26,359
Did you meet Tom Oakley?

929
01:04:26,431 --> 01:04:30,697
- Yes. You mean you didn't call me?
- No, l didn't call you.

930
01:04:30,769 --> 01:04:33,670
l'm sorry. l'm really sorry.

931
01:04:34,739 --> 01:04:38,175
Listen, l really am meeting somebody.

932
01:04:38,243 --> 01:04:41,804
There's no way l can hear a pitch
right now. Call me tomorrow.

933
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:46,977
No, l can't do it tomorrow. l've got
a meeting at Paramount and Universal.

934
01:04:47,052 --> 01:04:48,679
Congratulations.

935
01:04:48,753 --> 01:04:51,085
- lf you don't hear it now, you'll lose.
- Then l lose it.

936
01:04:51,156 --> 01:04:53,317
lt'll take 20 seconds.
When your friend gets here--

937
01:04:53,391 --> 01:04:56,417
- What friend?
- Whoever you're gonna meet.

938
01:04:58,863 --> 01:05:00,831
Twenty-five words or less.

939
01:05:00,899 --> 01:05:04,665
Absolutely. You sit here, Tom.
Go.

940
01:05:05,737 --> 01:05:08,535
- The D.A. is at a moral crossroads.
- Tom! Jesus Christ.

941
01:05:10,275 --> 01:05:13,608
We open outside
the largest penitentiary in California.

942
01:05:13,678 --> 01:05:17,079
lt's night. lt's raining.
A limousine comes through the gate...

943
01:05:17,148 --> 01:05:20,606
past demonstrators holding
a candlelight vigil.

944
01:05:20,685 --> 01:05:24,382
The candles under the umbrellas
glow like Japanese lanterns.

945
01:05:24,456 --> 01:05:27,482
That's nice. l haven't seen that before.
That's good.

946
01:05:27,559 --> 01:05:31,393
A lone demonstrator, a black woman,
steps in front of the limousine.

947
01:05:31,463 --> 01:05:33,761
The lights illuminate her
like a spirit.

948
01:05:33,832 --> 01:05:37,268
Her eyes fix upon those
of the sole passenger.

949
01:05:39,504 --> 01:05:41,438
The moment is devastating
between them.

950
01:05:41,506 --> 01:05:44,737
He's the D.A. She's the mother
of the person being executed.

951
01:05:44,809 --> 01:05:47,403
You're good!
l told you he's good.

952
01:05:47,479 --> 01:05:48,912
Go on.

953
01:05:48,980 --> 01:05:51,574
The D.A. believes
in the death penalty.

954
01:05:51,649 --> 01:05:56,416
And the execution is a hard case.
Black, 19, and definitely guilty.

955
01:05:56,488 --> 01:06:00,948
The greatest democracy in the world, and
36% of people on death row are black.

956
01:06:01,026 --> 01:06:03,051
Poor, disadvantaged black.

957
01:06:03,128 --> 01:06:06,063
He swears the next person
he sees to die...

958
01:06:06,131 --> 01:06:08,497
will be smart, rich and white.

959
01:06:08,566 --> 01:06:12,332
- You, me, whoever.
- What a hook! Beauty hook.

960
01:06:12,404 --> 01:06:14,531
Cut to the chase.

961
01:06:14,606 --> 01:06:18,975
Cut from the D.A. to an up-market
suburban neighborhood.

962
01:06:19,044 --> 01:06:22,411
A couple have a fight.
He leaves in a fit, gets in a car.

963
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:24,607
lt's the same rainy night.

964
01:06:24,682 --> 01:06:27,412
The car spins out
and goes into a ravine.

965
01:06:27,485 --> 01:06:29,680
The body is swept away.

966
01:06:29,754 --> 01:06:34,817
When the police examine the car, they
find the brakes have been tampered with.

967
01:06:34,893 --> 01:06:38,192
lt's murder, and the D.A. decides
to go for the big one.

968
01:06:38,263 --> 01:06:40,925
He's going to put the wife
in the gas chamber.

969
01:06:40,999 --> 01:06:42,933
But the D.A. falls in love
with the wife.

970
01:06:43,001 --> 01:06:45,265
Of course! But he puts her
in the gas chamber anyway.

971
01:06:46,304 --> 01:06:49,296
Then he finds that the husband
is alive.

972
01:06:49,374 --> 01:06:52,138
That he faked his death.

973
01:06:52,210 --> 01:06:55,441
The D.A. breaks into the prison,
runs down death row...

974
01:06:55,513 --> 01:06:57,572
but he gets there too late.

975
01:06:57,649 --> 01:07:00,117
The gas pellets have been dropped.

976
01:07:00,185 --> 01:07:02,483
She's dead.

977
01:07:02,554 --> 01:07:06,490
l tell you,
there's not a dry eye in the house.

978
01:07:06,558 --> 01:07:08,185
She's dead?

979
01:07:08,259 --> 01:07:13,162
She's dead. She's dead
because that's the reality.

980
01:07:13,231 --> 01:07:16,223
The innocent die.

981
01:07:16,301 --> 01:07:19,361
- Who's the D.A.?
- No one.

982
01:07:19,437 --> 01:07:20,461
No one?

983
01:07:20,538 --> 01:07:23,530
No stars on this project.
We're going out on a limb on one.

984
01:07:23,608 --> 01:07:26,441
Like unknown stage actors...

985
01:07:26,511 --> 01:07:29,173
or maybe somebody English
like what's-his-name.

986
01:07:31,382 --> 01:07:33,247
- Why?
- Why?

987
01:07:33,318 --> 01:07:38,654
This story is too damned important to
risk being overwhelmed by personality.

988
01:07:38,723 --> 01:07:41,351
That's fine for action pictures,
but this is special.

989
01:07:41,426 --> 01:07:43,360
We want real people.

990
01:07:43,428 --> 01:07:46,226
We don't want people coming
with any preconceived notions.

991
01:07:46,297 --> 01:07:50,028
-We want 'em to see a district attorney.
-Bruce Willis.

992
01:07:50,101 --> 01:07:52,763
Not Bruce Willis or Kevin Costner.

993
01:07:52,837 --> 01:07:55,738
This is an innocent woman
fighting for her life.

994
01:07:55,807 --> 01:07:57,775
- Julia Roberts.
- lf we can get her.

995
01:07:57,842 --> 01:07:59,275
We can!

996
01:07:59,344 --> 01:08:03,940
lf l'm perfectly honest,
this isn't even an American film.

997
01:08:06,217 --> 01:08:10,278
- lt's not?
- No. There are no stars.

998
01:08:10,355 --> 01:08:13,119
No pat happy endings,
no Schwarzenegger, no stickups...

999
01:08:13,191 --> 01:08:15,182
no terrorists.

1000
01:08:15,260 --> 01:08:19,060
This is a tough story, a tragedy
in which an innocent woman dies.

1001
01:08:19,130 --> 01:08:23,123
Why? Because that happens!

1002
01:08:25,103 --> 01:08:27,401
Habeas Corpus.

1003
01:08:27,472 --> 01:08:32,205
That's what we're calling it.
'Produce the Corpse.' What do you say?

1004
01:08:33,545 --> 01:08:38,482
-That pitch was more than 25 words.
-But it's brilliant! What's the verdict?

1005
01:08:38,550 --> 01:08:41,815
- Mr. Mill, for you.
- Who gave this to you?

1006
01:08:41,886 --> 01:08:45,219
- l received it at the front desk.
- What is it?

1007
01:08:48,059 --> 01:08:51,654
lt's from the person l was meeting.

1008
01:08:51,729 --> 01:08:53,720
He's not coming.

1009
01:08:53,798 --> 01:08:56,426
Do we have a shot?

1010
01:08:56,501 --> 01:08:59,959
lt's an intriguing idea.
Give me a call at the studio tomorrow.

1011
01:09:00,038 --> 01:09:03,439
There's a scene in Throne of Blood
that has exactly the texture--

1012
01:09:03,508 --> 01:09:07,000
- Tom, just say thank you.
- She has to die! No Hollywood ending.

1013
01:09:07,078 --> 01:09:10,195
Tom, say thank you!

1014
01:11:04,142 --> 01:11:08,875
Fuck! You fucking dog-shit writer!
You fucking tried to kill me!

1015
01:11:32,537 --> 01:11:36,029
Oh, God, you gave me such a scare!

1016
01:11:36,107 --> 01:11:38,974
What are you doing here?

1017
01:11:39,043 --> 01:11:42,877
You gave me such a fright.
Come in.

1018
01:11:42,947 --> 01:11:44,642
Come on in.

1019
01:11:46,484 --> 01:11:50,386
What's the matter?
You look terrible.

1020
01:11:50,455 --> 01:11:51,888
What's up?

1021
01:11:54,392 --> 01:11:56,883
Sit down.
l'll get you a drink.

1022
01:12:07,872 --> 01:12:09,931
Something happened.

1023
01:12:11,109 --> 01:12:15,307
- ls it too late?
- No, it's not too late.

1024
01:12:15,380 --> 01:12:17,541
l don't even know what time it is.

1025
01:12:17,615 --> 01:12:19,378
What's wrong?

1026
01:12:24,689 --> 01:12:29,683
- What are you painting? ls that me?
- Yes, it's you.

1027
01:12:31,329 --> 01:12:32,853
See?

1028
01:12:32,930 --> 01:12:35,057
Do you have snakes in lceland?

1029
01:12:35,133 --> 01:12:37,158
Snakes? No, l don't think so.

1030
01:12:37,235 --> 01:12:39,203
Are you afraid of snakes?

1031
01:12:39,270 --> 01:12:42,239
l don't know.
l've never come close to a real one.

1032
01:12:42,306 --> 01:12:44,934
They scare the shit out of me.

1033
01:12:50,448 --> 01:12:51,938
Have another.

1034
01:12:52,016 --> 01:12:54,382
l don't usually drink.

1035
01:12:57,688 --> 01:13:01,124
Something happened tonight.

1036
01:13:01,192 --> 01:13:02,989
Yes, but...

1037
01:13:05,129 --> 01:13:08,121
there's something else
l have to tell you.

1038
01:13:10,234 --> 01:13:13,397
This isn't easy for me.

1039
01:13:13,471 --> 01:13:14,904
Yes?

1040
01:13:21,879 --> 01:13:24,404
How about if l just get on
with my work...

1041
01:13:24,482 --> 01:13:28,418
and you talk to me
when you feel like it, okay?

1042
01:13:35,693 --> 01:13:38,321
l came very close
to dying tonight.

1043
01:13:41,999 --> 01:13:44,365
All l could think about
was you.

1044
01:13:45,436 --> 01:13:47,996
l don't even know you...

1045
01:13:48,072 --> 01:13:50,973
but you came into my mind.

1046
01:13:54,779 --> 01:13:57,714
l couldn't think of anything else.

1047
01:14:00,151 --> 01:14:03,086
Remember that first night
we spoke on the phone?

1048
01:14:05,289 --> 01:14:09,453
l was outside these windows
watching you and--

1049
01:14:13,664 --> 01:14:16,064
lt was so exciting.

1050
01:14:18,202 --> 01:14:19,999
So new.

1051
01:14:22,340 --> 01:14:23,932
Strange.

1052
01:14:27,311 --> 01:14:30,212
l can't get you out of my mind.

1053
01:14:33,150 --> 01:14:36,313
Are you making love to me?

1054
01:14:38,389 --> 01:14:40,482
Yes, l guess l am.

1055
01:14:42,326 --> 01:14:44,260
l guess l am.

1056
01:14:47,532 --> 01:14:49,898
l want to make love to you.

1057
01:14:57,608 --> 01:14:59,667
lt's too soon.

1058
01:15:02,780 --> 01:15:05,146
lt's too soon, isn't it?

1059
01:15:07,084 --> 01:15:09,678
lt's so strange
how things happen.

1060
01:15:11,689 --> 01:15:13,987
David was here...

1061
01:15:14,058 --> 01:15:16,026
then he left.

1062
01:15:17,128 --> 01:15:18,925
You arrived.

1063
01:15:21,432 --> 01:15:24,458
Maybe it's just the timing,
but l feel like...

1064
01:15:24,535 --> 01:15:27,663
l would go anywhere with you...

1065
01:15:29,407 --> 01:15:31,341
if you asked.

1066
01:15:35,079 --> 01:15:37,479
But we mustn't hurry things.

1067
01:15:37,548 --> 01:15:40,984
We can't hurry things...

1068
01:15:41,052 --> 01:15:43,452
any more than we can stop them.

1069
01:15:45,690 --> 01:15:47,954
l think you better go now.

1070
01:15:48,025 --> 01:15:50,619
l think l'm going to cry now.

1071
01:15:55,032 --> 01:15:57,330
You better go quick.

1072
01:16:03,841 --> 01:16:05,468
l'm sorry.

1073
01:16:05,543 --> 01:16:08,876
No, no, don't be sorry.
Just go home...

1074
01:16:08,946 --> 01:16:12,211
and get some sleep.

1075
01:16:12,283 --> 01:16:14,683
Call me...

1076
01:16:14,752 --> 01:16:16,515
tomorrow.

1077
01:16:17,722 --> 01:16:20,247
lnvite me on a proper date.

1078
01:16:21,325 --> 01:16:23,418
l'd like that.

1079
01:16:38,279 --> 01:16:42,443
Jan? Jan!
Get me Larry Levy on the phone.

1080
01:16:42,516 --> 01:16:45,178
- l don't think he's on the lot.
- Try his car.

1081
01:16:46,253 --> 01:16:49,745
- lsn't he at Fox?
- He used to be. Not anymore.

1082
01:16:49,824 --> 01:16:52,520
l pitched him something
a few months ago. He hated it.

1083
01:16:53,727 --> 01:16:56,025
- That Griffin?
- Yeah.

1084
01:16:56,096 --> 01:17:00,396
Larry, Tom Oakley and Andy Civella
are here. l wouldn't bother you...

1085
01:17:00,467 --> 01:17:02,526
but you should hear their idea now.

1086
01:17:02,603 --> 01:17:05,094
- Hi, guys
- Hi, Larry.

1087
01:17:05,172 --> 01:17:10,166
The voice you'll hear has an English
accent. Tom Oakley. l'm Andy Civella.

1088
01:17:10,244 --> 01:17:12,838
Hi, Andy. l know Tom.
How are you?

1089
01:17:12,913 --> 01:17:15,040
Very well, Larry.
And yourself?

1090
01:17:15,115 --> 01:17:17,174
Fine. What's your story?

1091
01:17:18,285 --> 01:17:21,914
We open outside San Quentin.
lt's night.

1092
01:17:21,989 --> 01:17:23,718
lt's raining.

1093
01:17:23,791 --> 01:17:27,192
A limousine enters through the gate,
past demonstrators...

1094
01:17:27,261 --> 01:17:29,889
holding a candlelight vigil.

1095
01:17:29,964 --> 01:17:33,229
The candles flicker under umbrellas
glowing like Japanese lanterns.

1096
01:17:33,300 --> 01:17:37,031
A lone demonstrator, a black woman,
steps in front of the limousine.

1097
01:17:37,104 --> 01:17:39,698
Her eyes connect
with the lone passenger.

1098
01:17:39,773 --> 01:17:41,832
lt's a devastating moment.

1099
01:17:41,909 --> 01:17:43,774
lncredibly potent.

1100
01:17:46,113 --> 01:17:49,378
No stars. No Schwarzenegger.
No pat Hollywood endings.

1101
01:17:49,450 --> 01:17:53,079
No car chases.
This is an American tragedy...

1102
01:17:53,153 --> 01:17:55,212
in which an innocent woman dies.

1103
01:17:55,289 --> 01:17:58,588
Because that happens.
That's reality.

1104
01:17:59,660 --> 01:18:01,651
Take me off the speaker phone.

1105
01:18:04,899 --> 01:18:09,598
l don't know. lt's a really hot story.
But what is this bullshit, no stars?

1106
01:18:09,670 --> 01:18:13,629
Let me give you a little tip.
Levison came to power on two movies.

1107
01:18:13,707 --> 01:18:16,073
He made $300 million
with no stars in them.

1108
01:18:16,143 --> 01:18:18,577
He will love this idea.
lt'll remind him of his youth.

1109
01:18:18,646 --> 01:18:21,911
His motto used to be
'No stars, just talent.'

1110
01:18:21,982 --> 01:18:25,145
- Has anyone else heard this?
- l don't think so.

1111
01:18:26,020 --> 01:18:27,954
Make a deal now.

1112
01:18:28,022 --> 01:18:31,116
Tomorrow may be too late.
Can we get ahold of Levison?

1113
01:18:31,191 --> 01:18:33,659
Yeah, l'll get Levison.
When can you be back?

1114
01:18:33,727 --> 01:18:35,490
After my AA meeting.

1115
01:18:35,562 --> 01:18:40,295
l didn't realize
you had a drinking problem.

1116
01:18:40,367 --> 01:18:44,997
l don't really, but that's where all the
deals are being made these days. See ya.

1117
01:18:46,540 --> 01:18:48,667
Tom, that was a hell of a pitch.

1118
01:18:50,744 --> 01:18:53,577
Good work.
l think you sold Larry.

1119
01:18:53,647 --> 01:18:55,945
Great! When will we hear?

1120
01:18:56,016 --> 01:19:00,146
Go home, put some champagne on ice.
l'll give you an answer by tonight.

1121
01:19:00,220 --> 01:19:02,017
Jan, come here.

1122
01:19:02,089 --> 01:19:07,026
You move in mysterious ways,
but l like it.

1123
01:19:07,094 --> 01:19:09,062
Did Levy understand? No stars.

1124
01:19:09,129 --> 01:19:11,825
Yes, he was particularly attracted
to that notion.

1125
01:19:11,899 --> 01:19:14,129
- No Hollywood ending?
- No Hollywood ending.

1126
01:19:17,204 --> 01:19:19,434
They looked happy.

1127
01:19:19,506 --> 01:19:22,532
They have a completely fucked-up idea
that has no second act.

1128
01:19:22,609 --> 01:19:25,339
lf l hadn't heard it myself,
l never would've believed it.

1129
01:19:25,412 --> 01:19:28,609
Larry Levy liked it
because he's a dickbrain.

1130
01:19:28,682 --> 01:19:31,048
Levy will sell the idea
to Levison.

1131
01:19:31,118 --> 01:19:33,609
Then l will let Levison have
the brilliant idea...

1132
01:19:33,687 --> 01:19:36,918
of letting Larry
take over the project from me.

1133
01:19:36,991 --> 01:19:38,515
You will?

1134
01:19:38,592 --> 01:19:41,254
Levison can't wait
to get in bed with Levy.

1135
01:19:41,328 --> 01:19:45,594
This piece-of-shit idea
will blow up in both their faces.

1136
01:19:45,666 --> 01:19:50,069
And then l will step in
and save the day.

1137
01:19:52,339 --> 01:19:53,897
Yes!

1138
01:19:55,042 --> 01:19:57,237
Three points.

1139
01:19:57,311 --> 01:19:59,575
Great shot!

1140
01:20:02,983 --> 01:20:04,974
She's receiving the last rites.

1141
01:20:05,052 --> 01:20:07,782
The D.A. discovers that the husband
faked his own death.

1142
01:20:07,855 --> 01:20:11,222
She's innocent. He races to
the penitentiary, but it's too late.

1143
01:20:11,291 --> 01:20:13,782
The pellets have dropped.
She's dead.

1144
01:20:13,861 --> 01:20:16,352
He helped kill the woman he loved.

1145
01:20:16,430 --> 01:20:19,797
- Who are the stars?
- No stars, just talent.

1146
01:20:19,867 --> 01:20:21,892
No stars?

1147
01:20:21,969 --> 01:20:25,735
What the fuck kind of ending
do you call that? lt's depressing.

1148
01:20:25,806 --> 01:20:29,867
Depressing? Terms of Endearment,
Love Story, Steel Magnolias?

1149
01:20:29,943 --> 01:20:32,912
E.T. grossed $319 million
worldwide...

1150
01:20:32,980 --> 01:20:35,107
and there wasn't a dry eye
in the house.

1151
01:20:35,182 --> 01:20:37,616
- Depressing? l don't think so.
- Yeah, but--

1152
01:20:37,684 --> 01:20:40,448
Normally l'd agree with you, but this
is an entirely different kind of deal.

1153
01:20:40,521 --> 01:20:44,389
lt is a matter of taking the risk,
rolling the dice.

1154
01:20:44,458 --> 01:20:47,484
But if they come up 7,
bingo!

1155
01:20:48,595 --> 01:20:51,029
lt's Oscar time.

1156
01:20:51,098 --> 01:20:53,589
- Do they screw?
- Who?

1157
01:20:53,667 --> 01:20:56,135
The D.A. and the woman.
Do they screw?

1158
01:20:56,203 --> 01:21:00,230
lf l'm going to be looking at jail cells
and gas chambers, you need some sex.

1159
01:21:00,307 --> 01:21:03,902
Sure, of course.
We'll get it there. No problem.

1160
01:21:03,977 --> 01:21:06,946
Who's gonna shepherd this thing?

1161
01:21:08,382 --> 01:21:10,942
Larry, you seem to have a good feel
for this. You want to run with it?

1162
01:21:11,018 --> 01:21:14,146
- This project originated with Griffin.
- Bonnie.

1163
01:21:14,221 --> 01:21:16,655
l don't want to dance
at somebody else's wedding.

1164
01:21:16,723 --> 01:21:19,214
lf it's Griffin's project,
it's Griffin's.

1165
01:21:19,293 --> 01:21:22,262
- We should--
- Bonnie, this will have to be my call.

1166
01:21:24,631 --> 01:21:26,565
lt's fine with me.

1167
01:21:26,633 --> 01:21:29,067
My plate is full anyway.

1168
01:21:29,136 --> 01:21:33,470
Larry, it's yours. Hit a home run,
win an Oscar for the home team.

1169
01:21:35,876 --> 01:21:39,243
Griffin, l've got something else
for you. New York tomorrow.

1170
01:21:39,313 --> 01:21:42,771
Tom Wolfe's new book will be in a room
at the hotel. Read it and make your bid.

1171
01:21:42,850 --> 01:21:46,217
Send Bonnie. She'll know if it's
a movie. lf it is, the bid's a million.

1172
01:21:46,286 --> 01:21:49,153
- Me?
- A million! That's high, isn't it?

1173
01:21:49,223 --> 01:21:51,953
lt's Tom Wolfe.
Why not you?

1174
01:21:52,025 --> 01:21:54,550
l'm a story editor.
That's a vice president's job.

1175
01:21:54,628 --> 01:21:57,654
- You don't want to be a vice president?
- Bonnie, pack your bags.

1176
01:21:57,731 --> 01:22:02,361
Congratulations. That was
the most amazing piece l've ever heard.

1177
01:22:02,436 --> 01:22:05,337
- lf you don't want the responsibility--
- No, l'm going.

1178
01:22:05,405 --> 01:22:07,669
l really want to be
one of your soldiers.

1179
01:22:07,741 --> 01:22:11,643
- l'm glad you're on the team.
- Bonnie will be gone. l'm here for you.

1180
01:22:13,380 --> 01:22:15,075
Whitney, now!

1181
01:22:16,049 --> 01:22:17,914
Frank, Marty, come in.

1182
01:22:19,386 --> 01:22:21,479
- May l have a word with you?
- l have a meeting.

1183
01:22:21,555 --> 01:22:24,046
- Find the time. What is going on?
- What do you mean?

1184
01:22:24,124 --> 01:22:27,116
Handing Larry Levy your project.

1185
01:22:27,194 --> 01:22:29,628
l thought Larry had...

1186
01:22:29,696 --> 01:22:33,962
a firm grasp
on the style of the piece.

1187
01:22:34,034 --> 01:22:37,003
The only thing Larry Levy
has a firm grasp on is his dick!

1188
01:22:37,070 --> 01:22:39,095
l'm not Oz,
l can't do everything.

1189
01:22:39,173 --> 01:22:41,403
Why shouldn't l use Larry if l think he
has what it takes to get a picture made?

1190
01:22:41,475 --> 01:22:44,410
- That way everybody wins.
- Why are you bullshitting me?

1191
01:22:44,478 --> 01:22:46,810
- l'm not!
- You never used to bullshit me.

1192
01:22:46,880 --> 01:22:50,646
l know you.
You've been stringing me along.

1193
01:22:50,717 --> 01:22:53,709
- Habeas Corpus, Griff.
- Habeas Corpus.

1194
01:22:55,422 --> 01:22:57,822
You've been stringing me along
like one of your goddamn writers.

1195
01:22:57,891 --> 01:23:01,850
Why get Levison to send me to New York?
Are you trying to get rid of me?

1196
01:23:01,929 --> 01:23:04,159
Get rid of you?
l'm trying to help you.

1197
01:23:04,231 --> 01:23:08,065
lf you score in New York, Levison
has to make you a vice president.

1198
01:23:08,135 --> 01:23:11,263
Jesus, are you afraid of success?

1199
01:23:11,338 --> 01:23:13,863
Are you seeing someone else?

1200
01:23:13,941 --> 01:23:17,536
- That's what this is about?
- Not just this. lt's a lot of things.

1201
01:23:17,611 --> 01:23:20,910
lt's the way you've been acting.
Something is going on.

1202
01:23:20,981 --> 01:23:22,972
Jesus Christ.

1203
01:23:23,050 --> 01:23:26,486
You're not even looking at me
when you're talking to me.

1204
01:23:26,553 --> 01:23:29,113
Please look me in the eyes
and just tell me.

1205
01:23:29,189 --> 01:23:32,784
No bullshit.
ls there someone else?

1206
01:23:36,797 --> 01:23:38,765
Have a good trip.

1207
01:23:44,838 --> 01:23:48,831
Our top story this evening involves
Hollywood's three favorite G's.

1208
01:23:48,909 --> 01:23:51,810
A glamourous, glitzy, gala night
on the town.

1209
01:23:51,878 --> 01:23:54,005
lt is a who's who of stars.

1210
01:23:54,081 --> 01:23:57,983
No l.D.s necessary,
household names one and all.

1211
01:23:58,051 --> 01:23:59,678
Leeza Gibbons reporting here.

1212
01:23:59,753 --> 01:24:02,950
Right this minute you could fire
a cannon down Sunset Boulevard...

1213
01:24:03,023 --> 01:24:04,193
and not come close to hitting
a celebrity.

1214
01:24:04,193 --> 01:24:05,353
and not come close to hitting
a celebrity.

1215
01:24:05,427 --> 01:24:09,227
Everybody who is anybody
is right here rubbing elbows...

1216
01:24:09,298 --> 01:24:11,562
and making big talk
in this ballroom.

1217
01:24:11,633 --> 01:24:15,160
All the movers, the shakers,
behind the scenes and on the screens.

1218
01:24:15,237 --> 01:24:18,365
Leave it to Cher to wear red...

1219
01:24:18,440 --> 01:24:20,806
when the impossible-to-come-by
invitations...

1220
01:24:20,876 --> 01:24:23,606
call for 'black and white only,
please.'

1221
01:24:23,679 --> 01:24:25,772
Hi, Terry, nice to see you.

1222
01:24:25,847 --> 01:24:28,611
June Gudmundsdottir,
Teri Garr, Buck Henry.

1223
01:24:28,684 --> 01:24:33,053
The occasion this evening, as big
and important as the all-star turnout.

1224
01:24:33,121 --> 01:24:36,955
The studio, world-famous for the slogan
'Movies, now more than ever'...

1225
01:24:37,025 --> 01:24:41,587
is donating prints of 25 of its classic
black-and-white films to the museum.

1226
01:24:41,663 --> 01:24:45,030
Now they'll be able to say,
'Movies, now more than ever forever.'

1227
01:24:45,100 --> 01:24:47,261
Thank you.

1228
01:24:47,336 --> 01:24:52,399
lt's wonderful to see so many familiar
and friendly faces around.

1229
01:24:53,675 --> 01:24:58,908
As you know, the L.A. County Museum
has always been close to our hearts...

1230
01:24:58,981 --> 01:25:01,677
and especially the motion department.

1231
01:25:01,750 --> 01:25:04,184
Motion picture department!

1232
01:25:05,320 --> 01:25:08,517
We're happy to make possible
this donation.

1233
01:25:10,425 --> 01:25:14,259
l'd like to introduce a man
whose idea this all was.

1234
01:25:14,329 --> 01:25:16,695
Griffin Mill, please.

1235
01:25:22,938 --> 01:25:25,463
Thank you, Joel.

1236
01:25:25,540 --> 01:25:27,940
Grab another drink.

1237
01:25:31,580 --> 01:25:33,912
l'd like to extend my thanks...

1238
01:25:33,982 --> 01:25:36,348
to the patrons of
the Los Angeles County Museum.

1239
01:25:37,352 --> 01:25:40,412
You have long fostered the art
of motion pictures...

1240
01:25:40,489 --> 01:25:44,357
as a serious and valuable art form
in this community.

1241
01:25:45,661 --> 01:25:48,687
Many people across the country
and around the world...

1242
01:25:48,764 --> 01:25:52,564
have for too long thought of movies
as a popular entertainment...

1243
01:25:52,634 --> 01:25:55,228
more than serious art.

1244
01:25:55,304 --> 01:25:59,400
l'm afraid a large majority of the press
supports this attitude.

1245
01:25:59,474 --> 01:26:03,342
We want great films
with long shelf lives.

1246
01:26:03,412 --> 01:26:06,245
We want the films
of the new John Hustons...

1247
01:26:06,315 --> 01:26:09,307
Orson Welles, Frank Capras.

1248
01:26:09,384 --> 01:26:14,344
We and the other major film studios
have a responsibility to the public...

1249
01:26:14,423 --> 01:26:18,416
to maintain the art
of motion pictures...

1250
01:26:18,493 --> 01:26:21,428
as our primary mandate.

1251
01:26:21,496 --> 01:26:26,058
Movies are art, now...

1252
01:26:26,134 --> 01:26:28,193
more than ever.

1253
01:26:29,271 --> 01:26:30,829
Thank you.

1254
01:26:38,447 --> 01:26:41,314
Griffin, that was a hell of a job.
Couldn't have done it better myself.

1255
01:26:41,383 --> 01:26:44,045
l'll know all of your lines soon.

1256
01:26:46,254 --> 01:26:50,315
- Well, are we having fun yet?
- l'm having a great time.

1257
01:26:50,392 --> 01:26:55,091
'Griffin Mill, the writer's enemy.
l'll get back to you'

1258
01:27:04,573 --> 01:27:07,269
ls this a friend of a friend?

1259
01:27:07,342 --> 01:27:09,242
- Sorry?
- How did you meet?

1260
01:27:09,311 --> 01:27:12,838
We met at a funeral.

1261
01:27:12,914 --> 01:27:16,441
- lsn't that right?
- Absolutely. Excuse us.

1262
01:27:53,722 --> 01:27:56,486
Don't make a scene.

1263
01:28:03,732 --> 01:28:06,963
That's what l call a real date.

1264
01:28:12,007 --> 01:28:14,498
Should l come in?

1265
01:28:14,576 --> 01:28:17,773
- Well--
- Well?

1266
01:28:17,846 --> 01:28:21,577
Not tonight, but soon.

1267
01:28:22,818 --> 01:28:24,479
Very soon.

1268
01:28:27,122 --> 01:28:29,420
- How about Mexico?
- Mexico?

1269
01:28:29,491 --> 01:28:31,482
Neutral territory.
Acapulco.

1270
01:28:31,560 --> 01:28:34,495
- l've never been there.
- We'll go.

1271
01:28:34,563 --> 01:28:36,963
- ls that the thing to do?
- That's a thing to do.

1272
01:28:37,032 --> 01:28:39,626
- Let's do it then.
- We'll go this weekend.

1273
01:28:39,701 --> 01:28:41,464
- Really?
- Yeah.

1274
01:28:44,005 --> 01:28:47,202
- Do l need a passport?
- Yes.

1275
01:29:35,323 --> 01:29:38,759
Mr. Mill, l'm Detective DeLongpre,
Pasadena police.

1276
01:29:38,827 --> 01:29:40,852
Yes, l recognize you.

1277
01:29:40,929 --> 01:29:43,159
Did you have a good time
at the party last night?

1278
01:29:43,231 --> 01:29:47,065
No, l didn't. l'm not supposed
to have a good time when l'm on duty.

1279
01:29:47,135 --> 01:29:49,569
Great. What do you want?

1280
01:29:49,638 --> 01:29:52,607
- Come down to the station.
- Why?

1281
01:29:52,674 --> 01:29:55,040
- To look at some pictures.
- Pictures?

1282
01:29:55,110 --> 01:29:58,443
Mug shots, like in the movies.

1283
01:29:58,513 --> 01:30:01,744
Ah, mug shots!
All right.

1284
01:30:01,816 --> 01:30:05,616
- Will you follow me to Pasadena?
- Pasadena.

1285
01:30:05,687 --> 01:30:08,485
Will you fasten your safety belt,
please?

1286
01:30:12,227 --> 01:30:16,095
No! Take your hands off of her!

1287
01:30:16,164 --> 01:30:18,655
- l want my baby.
- Where's her baby?

1288
01:30:20,168 --> 01:30:22,762
- Mr. Mill!
- Hello, how are you?

1289
01:30:22,837 --> 01:30:26,136
Good to see you. Everybody,
this is Mr. Mill. He makes movies.

1290
01:30:26,207 --> 01:30:27,902
Have a seat.

1291
01:30:28,977 --> 01:30:32,003
Where the fuck is he going?
Excuse me. Mr. Mill?

1292
01:30:32,080 --> 01:30:36,608
Not in here. This is my lieutenant's
office. Have a seat here.

1293
01:30:37,752 --> 01:30:39,777
All right.

1294
01:30:39,854 --> 01:30:44,757
Willa, could you?
Your desk? Thank you.

1295
01:30:44,826 --> 01:30:47,021
Sorry. Have a seat, Mr. Mill.

1296
01:30:47,095 --> 01:30:50,462
Before we start,
Paul saw a movie last night.

1297
01:30:50,532 --> 01:30:52,727
He raved about it.

1298
01:30:52,801 --> 01:30:56,862
- What was the name of that movie?
- Freaks.

1299
01:30:56,938 --> 01:31:01,307
- Have you seen this?
- Tod Browning. Yes.

1300
01:31:01,376 --> 01:31:04,174
One of us, one of us.

1301
01:31:04,245 --> 01:31:06,645
He came in doing that.
He was raving about it.

1302
01:31:06,715 --> 01:31:10,913
He loved it.
lt was thrilling for me. Willa?

1303
01:31:10,986 --> 01:31:15,821
Did you see where the tampons went?
l can't find them.

1304
01:31:15,890 --> 01:31:18,552
- l didn't take them.
- Did he take them?

1305
01:31:18,627 --> 01:31:20,561
- l don't know.
- Who did?

1306
01:31:20,629 --> 01:31:23,598
You see this? Damn!

1307
01:31:25,066 --> 01:31:28,593
- Do you have a break in the case?
- What makes you say that?

1308
01:31:28,670 --> 01:31:32,436
Well, why else
would you bring me here?

1309
01:31:33,908 --> 01:31:36,934
Why else, indeed.
Paul?

1310
01:31:37,012 --> 01:31:41,915
Paul, why have we brought
Mr. Mill in here today?

1311
01:31:41,983 --> 01:31:44,349
To look at some pictures.

1312
01:31:44,419 --> 01:31:46,717
Pictures.

1313
01:31:46,788 --> 01:31:51,487
Could you, if you remember,
what were you wearing that night?

1314
01:31:51,559 --> 01:31:55,518
l was wearing a double-breasted suit,
l believe.

1315
01:31:55,597 --> 01:31:57,565
Just-- lt's all right.

1316
01:31:57,632 --> 01:32:00,601
What's the matter?
You're so jumpy. Sit down.

1317
01:32:00,669 --> 01:32:03,229
- l'll get it.
- No, that's what she's here for.

1318
01:32:03,304 --> 01:32:06,273
- Have a seat.
- Sorry.

1319
01:32:08,376 --> 01:32:10,537
Will you take a look at this?

1320
01:32:10,612 --> 01:32:15,208
Where were they?
She found them. You're right.

1321
01:32:15,283 --> 01:32:18,013
Wait a minute.
No, these aren't mine.

1322
01:32:18,086 --> 01:32:20,077
These are slender regular.
These are yours.

1323
01:32:20,155 --> 01:32:24,888
- l guess you have jumbo.
- l use jumbo. These aren't mine.

1324
01:32:24,959 --> 01:32:27,951
God, just trying to help you out.

1325
01:32:28,029 --> 01:32:31,157
Did you see this guy
the night of the murder?

1326
01:32:34,202 --> 01:32:36,432
Sorry.

1327
01:32:36,504 --> 01:32:39,302
No, l, l-- You're putting me
in a terrible position here.

1328
01:32:39,374 --> 01:32:42,502
l would hate to get
the wrong person arrested.

1329
01:32:42,577 --> 01:32:46,775
Please! This is Pasadena. We do not
arrest the wrong person. That's L.A.

1330
01:32:46,848 --> 01:32:50,648
ln L.A. they kick your ass and then
they arrest you. We don't do that here.

1331
01:32:50,719 --> 01:32:53,187
Remember last year? What was
that guy's name they put on tape?

1332
01:32:53,254 --> 01:32:55,916
- What was that?
- King.

1333
01:32:55,990 --> 01:32:58,424
He was the wrong guy.

1334
01:33:01,629 --> 01:33:04,928
- Do you have a witness?
- l can't answer that.

1335
01:33:04,999 --> 01:33:08,696
Either you have a witness or these
are suspects in similar murders.

1336
01:33:08,770 --> 01:33:11,136
Have you been going
to detective school?

1337
01:33:11,206 --> 01:33:15,165
No, actually we're doing a movie
called Lonely Room.

1338
01:33:15,243 --> 01:33:17,302
Scott Glenn plays a detective
like yourself.

1339
01:33:17,378 --> 01:33:21,576
ls he a black woman?
Don't give me turkey.

1340
01:33:21,649 --> 01:33:26,348
Actually l was drawing the comparison
not based on race or gender.

1341
01:33:26,421 --> 01:33:30,858
Speaking of which,
did you go out with June--

1342
01:33:32,460 --> 01:33:35,861
- What is that woman's name?
- Gudmundsdottir.

1343
01:33:35,930 --> 01:33:37,454
What is it?

1344
01:33:37,532 --> 01:33:40,160
Who-- Spell it for me.

1345
01:33:40,235 --> 01:33:44,171
- G-U-D-M-U-N-D-S-D-O-T-T-l-R.
- That really helps.

1346
01:33:44,239 --> 01:33:47,572
- Did you go out with June--
- Gudmundsdottir.

1347
01:33:47,642 --> 01:33:50,372
- Yeah, her, last night?
- Yes, l did.

1348
01:33:50,445 --> 01:33:52,379
Have you known each other long?

1349
01:33:52,447 --> 01:33:54,915
No. l spoke to her for the first time
the night Kahane was killed.

1350
01:33:54,983 --> 01:33:59,181
- Wow. So you didn't know her before.
- No, l didn't.

1351
01:33:59,254 --> 01:34:03,156
We met over the phone. We got to talking
and one thing led to another.

1352
01:34:03,224 --> 01:34:05,749
Did you fuck her?

1353
01:34:05,827 --> 01:34:08,352
- What kind of question is that?
- l think it's pretty direct.

1354
01:34:08,429 --> 01:34:10,021
Did you fuck her?

1355
01:34:10,098 --> 01:34:13,829
l wouldn't answer that
without a lawyer in the room...

1356
01:34:13,902 --> 01:34:16,462
and then l probably
wouldn't even answer that question.

1357
01:34:16,538 --> 01:34:20,030
Why don't you ask your friend?
He's followed me. He'll probably know.

1358
01:34:20,108 --> 01:34:21,973
All right.

1359
01:34:22,043 --> 01:34:27,743
- Did Mr. Mill fuck June 'Hutmahuter'?
- l didn't see him.

1360
01:34:27,816 --> 01:34:30,717
- See? You got away with it.
- What are you implying?

1361
01:34:30,785 --> 01:34:34,016
l'm not implying anything. l asked you
a direct question. Did you fuck her?

1362
01:34:34,088 --> 01:34:36,420
l said l wouldn't answer
without a lawyer.

1363
01:34:36,491 --> 01:34:39,460
- Why are you getting angry?
- Because you're being rude.

1364
01:34:39,527 --> 01:34:45,022
Excuse me. But l think it's soon for her
to be gallivanting with you.

1365
01:34:45,099 --> 01:34:47,431
l'm there for her as a friend.

1366
01:34:48,837 --> 01:34:54,036
Why don't you call her? l'm sure she'd
be happy to pick over this horror...

1367
01:34:54,108 --> 01:34:56,770
and tell you
how we became friends.

1368
01:34:56,845 --> 01:34:59,871
What is this, fucking lran?
Since when does the State...

1369
01:34:59,948 --> 01:35:03,748
tell us how long and with whom
we can share our grief?

1370
01:35:03,818 --> 01:35:06,719
Or do you hold June Gudmundsdottir...

1371
01:35:06,788 --> 01:35:09,951
to a special code reserved for women?

1372
01:35:16,431 --> 01:35:20,663
- What the fuck are you laughing at?
- lt's just--

1373
01:35:20,735 --> 01:35:23,465
l'd like to talk to my lawyer.

1374
01:35:23,538 --> 01:35:25,836
One of us, one of us.

1375
01:35:40,238 --> 01:35:42,570
lt's time to get a good lawyer.

1376
01:35:42,640 --> 01:35:46,201
l had a drink with the guy, Walter.
That's all.

1377
01:35:46,277 --> 01:35:50,771
lf you went to Pasadena with intent to
kill, you could go to the gas chamber.

1378
01:35:52,083 --> 01:35:54,643
l went to Pasadena
with the intent to hire.

1379
01:35:54,719 --> 01:35:56,619
So you say.

1380
01:35:56,688 --> 01:35:59,486
The Schecter brothers are here.

1381
01:35:59,557 --> 01:36:01,889
Griffin, don't make us wait.

1382
01:36:01,960 --> 01:36:04,588
- Who is this man?
- The travel agent called.

1383
01:36:04,662 --> 01:36:07,563
- You're confirmed.
- Travel agent?

1384
01:36:07,632 --> 01:36:10,032
l'm going to Puerto Vallarta.

1385
01:36:10,101 --> 01:36:13,229
- You're leaving the country.
- For the weekend.

1386
01:36:13,304 --> 01:36:15,966
- lt's a risk.
- Why?

1387
01:36:16,040 --> 01:36:19,271
Because Larry Levy could have my office
in three days.

1388
01:36:19,344 --> 01:36:22,836
- That's what Walter thinks.
- You know something l don't know?

1389
01:36:25,316 --> 01:36:28,808
- You're pretty smooth.
- l sleep at night.

1390
01:36:30,388 --> 01:36:32,754
- You really should run a studio.
- Tell a friend.

1391
01:36:32,824 --> 01:36:35,691
Walter, it's been real.

1392
01:36:35,760 --> 01:36:40,197
We're tired of shuffling things around.
We want to go exclusive to one studio.

1393
01:36:40,265 --> 01:36:42,233
- How much have our last pictures made?
- $105 million.

1394
01:36:42,300 --> 01:36:47,169
- Some do better but we're under budget.
- He's not listening. Go to Columbia.

1395
01:36:47,238 --> 01:36:50,207
- We already went to Columbia.
- Oh, yeah. What did they say?

1396
01:36:51,442 --> 01:36:54,104
Hey, l got the Tom Wolfe book.

1397
01:36:54,178 --> 01:36:56,442
Congratulations.

1398
01:36:56,514 --> 01:36:59,608
Bonnie, make him give us a deal.
We want a home.

1399
01:36:59,684 --> 01:37:01,709
We're tired of shopping
everything around.

1400
01:37:01,786 --> 01:37:03,777
l thought that's how you guys liked
to do business.

1401
01:37:03,855 --> 01:37:05,789
We changed our minds.

1402
01:37:07,158 --> 01:37:09,626
l'll talk to you later.

1403
01:37:09,694 --> 01:37:11,821
Levison says you're going
out of town tomorrow.

1404
01:37:11,896 --> 01:37:14,490
For the weekend.

1405
01:37:14,565 --> 01:37:18,194
Are you going with someone
named June something?

1406
01:37:18,269 --> 01:37:19,827
Yes.

1407
01:37:20,972 --> 01:37:25,409
You took her to a party
with several hundred of my best friends.

1408
01:37:25,476 --> 01:37:27,410
She's recently widowed.

1409
01:37:27,478 --> 01:37:30,038
You weren't in town
so l took her.

1410
01:37:31,449 --> 01:37:34,213
And now you're taking her to Mexico
for the weekend.

1411
01:37:36,421 --> 01:37:40,084
- Let's leave. Mom and Dad are fighting.
- Guys.

1412
01:37:40,158 --> 01:37:44,356
Have your lawyer give me a call.
You've got a deal.

1413
01:37:44,429 --> 01:37:48,229
-Let's leave before he changes his mind.
-We have witnesses.

1414
01:38:01,179 --> 01:38:03,443
Have a good trip.

1415
01:38:05,350 --> 01:38:07,944
''M' The worst crime of all'

1416
01:38:29,007 --> 01:38:31,134
Did you bring your passport?

1417
01:38:31,209 --> 01:38:36,806
- Wanna hear something funny? l forgot.
- We'll have to go back and get it.

1418
01:38:36,881 --> 01:38:41,045
So stupid of me. We'll never be able
to make another plane. Damn it!

1419
01:38:42,286 --> 01:38:45,983
lt's all right. Anyway, l got a better
idea. Do you like the desert?

1420
01:38:46,057 --> 01:38:51,290
- l've never been.
- l know this great hideaway.

1421
01:38:51,362 --> 01:38:54,456
We'll go there. lt's a two hour drive.
l know the people. We'll call ahead.

1422
01:38:54,532 --> 01:38:56,932
Are we hiding?

1423
01:38:57,001 --> 01:38:59,970
Yes, we're hiding from everybody.

1424
01:39:02,306 --> 01:39:04,672
You'll like it there.
lt'll remind you of lceland.

1425
01:39:37,442 --> 01:39:41,674
Good evening, Mr. M. You're checked in.
Capone Villa. You know where it is.

1426
01:39:41,746 --> 01:39:44,078
Yes. Thanks.

1427
01:40:11,242 --> 01:40:14,109
Look! The water looks like
it's steaming.

1428
01:40:14,178 --> 01:40:16,646
Comes out of the ground that way.

1429
01:40:38,436 --> 01:40:41,337
There aren't many people around.

1430
01:40:41,405 --> 01:40:43,737
They're fully booked, actually.

1431
01:40:43,808 --> 01:40:46,675
- There's 50 rooms, 100 people.
- Where are they all?

1432
01:40:48,346 --> 01:40:49,904
Hiding.

1433
01:40:50,982 --> 01:40:55,043
- Sir?
- Two Banning Springs waters, please.

1434
01:40:55,119 --> 01:40:56,780
Right away.

1435
01:40:59,590 --> 01:41:01,922
Do places like this really exist?

1436
01:41:03,361 --> 01:41:05,090
Only in the movies.

1437
01:41:35,893 --> 01:41:39,329
Tell me about the movies you make.

1438
01:41:39,397 --> 01:41:41,126
Why?

1439
01:41:41,199 --> 01:41:45,158
Because l want to know
what you do.

1440
01:41:46,737 --> 01:41:51,800
l listen to stories and decide
if they'll make good movies or not.

1441
01:41:52,843 --> 01:41:55,038
l get 125 phone calls a day...

1442
01:41:55,112 --> 01:41:58,878
and if l let that slip to 100...

1443
01:41:58,950 --> 01:42:02,477
l know l'm not doing my job.

1444
01:42:05,022 --> 01:42:08,856
Everyone who calls wants to know
one thing.

1445
01:42:08,926 --> 01:42:12,362
They want me to say yes to them
and make their movie.

1446
01:42:12,430 --> 01:42:15,263
lf l say yes,
they think that come New Year's...

1447
01:42:15,333 --> 01:42:19,326
it will be just them and Jack Nicholson
on the slopes of Aspen.

1448
01:42:20,905 --> 01:42:23,066
That's what they think.

1449
01:42:25,509 --> 01:42:28,342
The problem is
l can only say yes...

1450
01:42:28,412 --> 01:42:32,143
my studio can only say yes
12 times a year.

1451
01:42:32,216 --> 01:42:36,983
And collectively we hear
about 50,000 stories a year.

1452
01:42:37,054 --> 01:42:39,579
So it's hard.

1453
01:42:39,657 --> 01:42:43,149
And l guess sometimes
l'm not nice...

1454
01:42:43,227 --> 01:42:46,788
and make enemies.

1455
01:42:49,200 --> 01:42:51,498
That's what l was to David.

1456
01:42:52,470 --> 01:42:54,904
Enemy.

1457
01:42:54,972 --> 01:42:59,136
- Was his story one of the 12?
- No, it wasn't.

1458
01:43:00,144 --> 01:43:01,611
Why?

1459
01:43:01,679 --> 01:43:06,776
lt lacked certain elements that we need
to market a film successfully.

1460
01:43:06,851 --> 01:43:08,546
What elements?

1461
01:43:11,055 --> 01:43:14,889
Suspense, laughter, violence...

1462
01:43:17,795 --> 01:43:19,820
hope, heart...

1463
01:43:22,600 --> 01:43:24,363
nudity, sex...

1464
01:43:26,470 --> 01:43:28,028
happy endings.

1465
01:43:29,707 --> 01:43:31,902
Mainly happy endings.

1466
01:43:35,379 --> 01:43:37,347
What about reality?

1467
01:43:39,150 --> 01:43:41,948
You're not from lceland, are you?

1468
01:43:42,920 --> 01:43:44,945
Did l say that?

1469
01:43:48,259 --> 01:43:52,457
Why don't you put me in the hot springs
and see if l melt?

1470
01:44:40,516 --> 01:44:42,279
l love you.

1471
01:44:42,351 --> 01:44:44,319
l know.

1472
01:44:56,332 --> 01:45:01,292
There's something you have to know,
something l have to tell you.

1473
01:45:01,370 --> 01:45:05,466
That's all right.
Nothing can change that.

1474
01:45:05,541 --> 01:45:10,240
- June, David's death.
- lt's in the past.

1475
01:45:11,114 --> 01:45:14,515
Don't. lt's another life.

1476
01:45:14,584 --> 01:45:17,553
There's something you have to know.

1477
01:45:17,620 --> 01:45:20,680
Don't say any more.
Don't.

1478
01:45:20,757 --> 01:45:24,124
- l was responsible.
- l love you. Don't!

1479
01:45:24,193 --> 01:45:27,390
- lt was my fault.
- Don't say that.

1480
01:45:27,463 --> 01:45:30,626
Don't, don't.
l love you.

1481
01:46:50,913 --> 01:46:55,543
Mr. M., l'm sorry disturb you. There's
a phone call and it sounds important.

1482
01:46:55,618 --> 01:46:59,679
- Who is it?
- Dick Mellen. He says he's your lawyer.

1483
01:47:21,377 --> 01:47:23,311
Dick, how'd you find me?

1484
01:47:23,379 --> 01:47:26,576
Come on, who the hell do you think
you're talking to?

1485
01:47:26,649 --> 01:47:28,640
Yeah. What's going on?

1486
01:47:28,718 --> 01:47:31,744
- Levison's out.
- Out?

1487
01:47:31,821 --> 01:47:35,655
- He's cleaning out his office.
- Who's taking over?

1488
01:47:35,725 --> 01:47:39,957
Nothing's been decided. We only know
Reggie Goldman went home with the clap.

1489
01:47:40,029 --> 01:47:42,725
Am l in a position to--

1490
01:47:42,798 --> 01:47:47,098
No studio politics. Why didn't
you tell me about this Kahane business?

1491
01:47:48,671 --> 01:47:51,731
Kahane? l tried to, but--

1492
01:47:51,807 --> 01:47:53,775
You didn't try hard enough.

1493
01:47:53,843 --> 01:47:56,778
You better be at the Pasadena
police station in four hours.

1494
01:47:58,281 --> 01:48:00,511
Pasadena? What for?

1495
01:48:00,583 --> 01:48:05,486
For a fucking lineup.
They got a witness evidently.

1496
01:48:05,554 --> 01:48:07,988
l found you a guy.
His name is Gar Girard.

1497
01:48:08,057 --> 01:48:10,651
He's a topflight criminal lawyer.
He's tough, hard-nosed.

1498
01:48:10,726 --> 01:48:14,526
Don't talk to anybody else.
Just get there.

1499
01:48:14,597 --> 01:48:19,864
- l'll be there.
- This is a tough one. Good luck.

1500
01:48:31,447 --> 01:48:36,077
Mr. Mill, the studio's very upset
about the publicity this might generate.

1501
01:48:36,152 --> 01:48:38,950
l'll handle the press, police, judge
and the witness.

1502
01:48:39,021 --> 01:48:43,321
Thank you for coming without a fight.
lt's in your best interest.

1503
01:48:43,392 --> 01:48:47,055
- Did you sleep in that suit?
- Get away from her. She's the enemy.

1504
01:48:47,129 --> 01:48:50,860
- Susan, l had a lovely time.
- l can't believe you remembered.

1505
01:48:50,933 --> 01:48:53,458
Mr. Mill, Gar Girard.
l'm here to represent you.

1506
01:48:53,536 --> 01:48:55,970
Dick Mellen called me in on this.
Here's the situation.

1507
01:48:56,038 --> 01:48:58,734
They've got a witness
and want you to do a lineup.

1508
01:48:58,808 --> 01:49:01,174
lf you say no, they'll arrest you.

1509
01:49:01,243 --> 01:49:04,303
Even if you get identified,
l'll get you off on bail.

1510
01:49:04,380 --> 01:49:07,872
This witness lives across the street
from the parking lot.

1511
01:49:07,950 --> 01:49:10,111
Even if she makes
an identification...

1512
01:49:10,186 --> 01:49:14,213
a positive l.D.,
it was very late at night.

1513
01:49:14,290 --> 01:49:18,192
By the time l'm finished with her, we'll
have a new legal standard for blindness.

1514
01:49:19,228 --> 01:49:22,425
This is like they do on TV.

1515
01:49:24,433 --> 01:49:28,164
Don't worry. You can see them,
but they can't see you.

1516
01:49:28,237 --> 01:49:31,138
Just tell the truth.

1517
01:49:31,207 --> 01:49:33,368
l saw him clearly.

1518
01:49:35,811 --> 01:49:37,972
Fire it up.

1519
01:49:38,047 --> 01:49:41,414
Number one, step forward.
Make a quarter turn to the right.

1520
01:49:43,652 --> 01:49:47,213
- Are those prescription glasses?
- You can't ask her that.

1521
01:49:47,289 --> 01:49:51,350
- lt's very hard, you know.
- Yeah, l know.

1522
01:49:51,427 --> 01:49:54,590
- l wouldn't want to pick the wrong one.
- No. God forbid.

1523
01:49:54,663 --> 01:49:58,793
- Just take your time.
- Anybody look...

1524
01:49:58,868 --> 01:50:01,200
vaguely familiar?

1525
01:50:01,270 --> 01:50:03,135
Well, you know--

1526
01:50:03,205 --> 01:50:05,173
Take your time.

1527
01:50:07,043 --> 01:50:10,911
- This is not easy.
- lt never is.

1528
01:50:10,980 --> 01:50:13,881
- l am trying.
- Yes, just take your time.

1529
01:50:13,949 --> 01:50:16,110
And l did see him clearly.

1530
01:50:23,559 --> 01:50:26,926
- l don't--
- Look hard. Take a good look.

1531
01:50:26,996 --> 01:50:28,930
l did. l am.

1532
01:50:29,899 --> 01:50:34,165
Um, could l see
number three again?

1533
01:50:34,236 --> 01:50:35,931
- Call number three.
- Wait.

1534
01:50:36,005 --> 01:50:39,202
- Could l--
- Could she call her own numbers?

1535
01:50:39,275 --> 01:50:42,506
- Excuse me, excuse me.
- Thank you.

1536
01:50:43,779 --> 01:50:46,680
Which number?
Number five.

1537
01:50:46,749 --> 01:50:49,274
Susan, l think she can call
who she's interested in.

1538
01:50:49,351 --> 01:50:51,444
- You're right.
- No, the other one.

1539
01:50:51,520 --> 01:50:53,010
That one.

1540
01:50:53,089 --> 01:50:55,785
Which one?

1541
01:50:55,858 --> 01:50:59,350
- lt's not number six.
- Not number six.

1542
01:50:59,428 --> 01:51:02,659
- Three.
- What do you mean number three?

1543
01:51:02,731 --> 01:51:04,858
l think she can request
who she wants to see.

1544
01:51:04,934 --> 01:51:07,664
- Wait. You want to see what number?
- Him.

1545
01:51:07,736 --> 01:51:11,172
That's him!
l'd swear on my mother's grave.

1546
01:51:11,240 --> 01:51:12,707
Number three.

1547
01:51:12,775 --> 01:51:15,437
- Number three?
- Number three.

1548
01:51:15,511 --> 01:51:17,843
Number three on her mother's grave.

1549
01:51:17,913 --> 01:51:20,279
We heard what she said.

1550
01:51:20,349 --> 01:51:22,283
Yeah, l would say so.

1551
01:51:22,351 --> 01:51:24,615
- Take them out.
- Number three. Thank you.

1552
01:51:26,188 --> 01:51:30,682
Ma'am, may l be personal?
Where the fuck is your mother buried?

1553
01:51:32,194 --> 01:51:34,458
Let's get out of here.

1554
01:51:39,735 --> 01:51:43,398
l don't know who got to that witness.
She wrapped up my case picking that cop.

1555
01:51:43,472 --> 01:51:46,635
You're a lucky man, Mr. Mill.
Goddamn, no ramp again!

1556
01:51:46,709 --> 01:51:49,473
Witnesses can't be relied on.
Remember Witness for the Prosecution?

1557
01:51:49,545 --> 01:51:51,638
Marlene Dietrich
and Tyrone Power?

1558
01:51:51,714 --> 01:51:54,581
You're free as a bird.
No witness, no crime.

1559
01:51:54,650 --> 01:51:56,982
That Avery woman thinks you got away
with murder.

1560
01:51:57,052 --> 01:51:59,452
Everybody does, Mr. Mill.

1561
01:52:47,036 --> 01:52:49,561
Our Father who art in heaven...

1562
01:52:49,638 --> 01:52:51,765
hallowed be Thy name.

1563
01:52:51,840 --> 01:52:54,001
Thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done...

1564
01:52:54,076 --> 01:52:57,011
on earth as it is in heaven.

1565
01:52:57,079 --> 01:53:00,515
Give us this day
our daily bread...

1566
01:53:00,583 --> 01:53:03,381
and forgive us
our trespasses--

1567
01:54:42,058 --> 01:54:45,892
You have made a wonderful movie.
lt's perfect.

1568
01:54:45,962 --> 01:54:48,157
lt's Oscar time, Larry.

1569
01:54:53,869 --> 01:54:54,995
What?

1570
01:54:55,071 --> 01:54:56,698
Too late. Come on.

1571
01:55:06,282 --> 01:55:07,874
Get back!

1572
01:55:28,337 --> 01:55:30,999
- What took you so long?
- Traffic was a bitch.

1573
01:55:41,817 --> 01:55:44,877
- lt's outstanding.
- The audience will love it.

1574
01:55:44,954 --> 01:55:46,512
You sold it out!

1575
01:55:46,589 --> 01:55:50,184
How could you let him sell you out?
What about truth? Reality?

1576
01:55:50,259 --> 01:55:53,490
What about the way the old ending
tested in Canoga Park?

1577
01:55:53,562 --> 01:55:56,963
Everybody hated it. We reshot it,
now everybody loves it.

1578
01:55:57,033 --> 01:56:00,696
- That's reality.
- But you had an ending which was true.

1579
01:56:00,770 --> 01:56:02,863
Who is this person?

1580
01:56:02,938 --> 01:56:05,202
Doesn't she know anything
about working with grown-ups?

1581
01:56:05,274 --> 01:56:10,211
Bonnie, goddamn it. This is a hit.
This is what we're here for.

1582
01:56:10,279 --> 01:56:12,577
lt didn't have to end this way.

1583
01:56:12,648 --> 01:56:15,913
- l want you out of here.
- Good thinking, Larry.

1584
01:56:15,985 --> 01:56:18,180
l'm going over your head, Larry.

1585
01:56:18,254 --> 01:56:20,449
Bonnie, you're fired.

1586
01:56:22,124 --> 01:56:23,751
Fuck you!

1587
01:56:23,826 --> 01:56:27,091
lt takes more to make it
in this business than a dirty mouth.

1588
01:56:27,163 --> 01:56:29,393
The campaign.

1589
01:56:57,560 --> 01:56:59,790
lt's very important.
l must talk to him.

1590
01:56:59,862 --> 01:57:02,626
- He's very busy.
- Please?

1591
01:57:02,698 --> 01:57:04,689
lt's me, Bonnie.
We're friends.

1592
01:57:04,767 --> 01:57:08,828
You don't understand.
l am not just me, l'm also the job.

1593
01:57:08,904 --> 01:57:10,838
Please? Please?

1594
01:57:11,874 --> 01:57:15,708
All right. l'll try. Okay?

1595
01:57:21,984 --> 01:57:24,851
Walter, stop that nonsense!

1596
01:57:24,920 --> 01:57:27,889
Griffin, it's Bonnie.

1597
01:57:27,957 --> 01:57:29,754
She's here.

1598
01:57:34,363 --> 01:57:37,730
- Did Levy fire her?
- Yes, sir, l guess he did.

1599
01:57:39,502 --> 01:57:41,936
l can't see her now.

1600
01:57:42,004 --> 01:57:44,370
l promised l'd be home early.

1601
01:57:45,441 --> 01:57:47,375
Tell her l'll get back to her.

1602
01:57:47,443 --> 01:57:51,038
- Get your foot off the fucking couch.
- Tell her yourself.

1603
01:57:51,113 --> 01:57:55,482
Yes. Could you hold, please?
Griffin, it's Larry Levy's--

1604
01:57:55,551 --> 01:57:58,714
Please! Griffin, please,
can we talk about it?

1605
01:57:58,787 --> 01:58:01,381
Bonnie, l know
you'll land on your feet.

1606
01:58:01,457 --> 01:58:05,757
lt's Larry Levy's office.
He says it's very important.

1607
01:58:06,896 --> 01:58:09,763
Give it a minute,
then transfer it to the car phone.

1608
01:58:21,844 --> 01:58:25,075
- Yeah?
- l have Larry Levy on the line.

1609
01:58:25,147 --> 01:58:27,206
How did the screening go?
How's my new ending?

1610
01:58:27,283 --> 01:58:32,277
Fantastic! Worked like gangbusters.
That's why you get the big bucks.

1611
01:58:32,354 --> 01:58:35,881
Yeah. Stop kissing my ass.
What do you want? Can't this wait?

1612
01:58:35,958 --> 01:58:40,452
l don't think it should. This is hot.
You should hear this writer's pitch.

1613
01:58:40,529 --> 01:58:43,464
- We should go for this great idea.
- Who's the writer?

1614
01:58:43,532 --> 01:58:46,194
l'll put him on the speaker.
Hold on.

1615
01:58:46,268 --> 01:58:51,433
Hi, Griff. Remember me? l'm the asshole
who was in the postcard business.

1616
01:58:51,507 --> 01:58:55,944
- You.
- The king of suspense. You remember.

1617
01:58:56,011 --> 01:58:58,138
l haven't heard from you for a while.

1618
01:58:58,214 --> 01:59:02,310
- l've been busy writing a script.
- Give him the pitch.

1619
01:59:02,384 --> 01:59:04,818
You'll love this. lt's great!

1620
01:59:04,887 --> 01:59:07,549
lt's a Hollywood story,
a real thriller.

1621
01:59:07,623 --> 01:59:11,059
lt's about a shit-bag producer,
studio exec...

1622
01:59:11,126 --> 01:59:14,789
who murders a writer
he thinks is harassing him.

1623
01:59:14,863 --> 01:59:17,889
The problem is,
he kills the wrong writer.

1624
01:59:17,967 --> 01:59:20,231
Now he's got to deal
with blackmail and the cops.

1625
01:59:20,302 --> 01:59:25,604
But, here's the switch.
The son of a bitch gets away with it.

1626
01:59:25,674 --> 01:59:27,938
Larry, get off the speaker.
l want to talk to him privately.

1627
01:59:28,010 --> 01:59:30,740
Sure.
This is a winner.

1628
01:59:30,813 --> 01:59:33,145
- He gets away with it?
- Absolutely.

1629
01:59:33,215 --> 01:59:34,910
A Hollywood ending.

1630
01:59:34,984 --> 01:59:38,613
He marries the dead writer's girl
and they live happily ever after.

1631
01:59:38,687 --> 01:59:43,056
- Can you guarantee that ending?
- lf the price is right, you got it.

1632
01:59:43,125 --> 01:59:46,856
- Guarantee that ending, you got a deal.
- l guarantee it.

1633
01:59:46,929 --> 01:59:50,330
- What do you call this thing?
- The Player.

1634
01:59:50,399 --> 01:59:52,230
The Player.

1635
01:59:54,970 --> 01:59:56,217
l like that.

1636
01:59:56,217 --> 01:59:57,149
l like that.

1637
01:59:59,653 --> 02:00:01,883
What took you so long?

1638
02:00:01,956 --> 02:00:04,186
Traffic was a bitch.
