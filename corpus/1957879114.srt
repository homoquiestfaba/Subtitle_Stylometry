1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:03,800
(dramatic music)

2
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:37,200
(electronic dialing)
(phone ringing)

3
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,560
(dramatic music)

4
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,840
- It's a half carat diamond
solitaire set and all.

5
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,000
(mumbles)

6
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,920
(knocks)

7
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,160
- Everybody down on
the floor, down, down!

8
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,480
Down!
(screams)

9
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:08,360
Down, down, down,
down, down, down!

10
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,240
Everyone down, down!

11
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,360
Don't you move.

12
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,160
- Don't you look at me.

13
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,120
- Stay calm everybody!

14
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,560
I'm sure you recognize the scene

15
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,520
that's unfolding before
you, it is in fact, a heist.

16
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,960
You may wanna keep
those heads down

17
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,360
or find it rolling
down the aisle.

18
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,120
Let's do it, Bobby.

19
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,840
- Get down, I told
you to get down!

20
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,680
(dramatic music)

21
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,200
Don't move, don't even breathe!

22
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,000
(dramatic music)

23
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,080
- No way man, I'm
not gonna call her.

24
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,400
- Look, there's a phone
booth right over there,

25
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,840
would you call her
so I don't have to

26
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,960
listen to you whine all day.

27
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,520
- She's three months
pregnant, Cates,

28
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,720
she shouldn't be working at all.

29
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,680
- Ah, what do you think,
she's June Clever?

30
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,520
It takes a lot of money
to raise kids nowadays.

31
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,640
Before you know it
they're off to college.

32
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,120
You're gonna need all
the money you can get.

33
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,560
- My wife is not supposed
to support the family.

34
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:17,800
- Lianne knew the score
before you were married.

35
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,000
I think we've been stood up.

36
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,040
- You know, I hate it when
she goes away mad too.

37
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:24,920
- Call her.

38
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,360
- All right, I'm gonna call
her, you got a quarter?

39
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,040
- Gladly.

40
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,960
- [Dispatcher] Base
to 112, come in Cates.

41
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,240
- Cates here, what do you got?

42
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,360
- [Dispatcher] We got a
tip on a jewelry heist

43
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,920
at 56 and 1st, sounds
like your boys.

44
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,640
- Yeah, we're on our way.

45
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,400
- I guess I'll call her later.

46
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,920
(engine revs)

47
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,720
(dramatic music)

48
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,680
- Yeah, we're clear.
- Hit it Bobby.

49
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,880
(dramatic music)

50
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,080
- [Reece] What time was it
that that last heist went down

51
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,600
on lower East Side?
- 11:30.

52
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,960
- What time is it now?
- 11:35.

53
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,800
- [Cates] Holy smoke, these
guys are either geniuses

54
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,040
or real stupid.

55
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,520
- They better be
geniuses 'cause if I've

56
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,360
been chasing idiots for
three years, I'm gonna quit.

57
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,200
- All right, everybody,
isn't this fun.

58
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,560
For the next few minutes
now I want you think of us

59
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,920
all as one big family.

60
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,280
Stay calm, we'll be
here a few more minutes,

61
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,320
then we'll be out of your hair.

62
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:47,280
Isn't that pretty hair,
nice shoes, Italian?

63
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,720
What size?

64
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,960
What size, asshole?
- Nine.

65
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,800
- Whoops, not my size.

66
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:05,280
(dramatic music)

67
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,120
(alarm rings)

68
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,880
- Whoa, relax, relax,
it's just Megan, relax.

69
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,720
What, cops, where, shit.

70
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,880
We gotta be out
of here, let's go.

71
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,920
Alternate extraction,
I need it now.

72
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:37,400
Everybody, come on, let's
go, we're out of here.

73
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,080
- You ready?
- I'm ready 24 hours a day.

74
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,840
- [Ronny] Everybody go, come on!

75
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,640
- You guys get out of here,
I'll take care of these pigs.

76
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,800
Come on you bastards,
come and get me!

77
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,640
(gun fires)

78
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,520
- What?

79
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:58,440
Extraction, it'll be
very messy around here

80
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,000
in about five minutes.

81
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,000
- Bobby go, come
on, let's move it!

82
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,960
Move it, they're on us!

83
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,680
(alarm rings)

84
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,560
Go!

85
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,480
Jeff, you hold the power, man.

86
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,320
(gun fires)

87
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,720
(grunts)

88
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,760
(gun fires)

89
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:44,160
- Are you okay, you okay?

90
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:47,000
(dramatic music)

91
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:37,440
- Shit. (hollers)
(gun fires)

92
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,040
(gun fires)

93
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,680
(electronic dialing)

94
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,960
(bomb beeps)

95
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:26,440
(climactic music)

96
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,640
(bomb beeps)

97
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,680
(loud exploding)

98
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,720
(police sirens wail)

99
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,440
- Cates, Cates, Cates!

100
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,360
Give me your radio, officer.

101
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,400
Cates, get back here,
what the hell happened,

102
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,200
I've got a jewelry
store robbery,

103
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,640
the destruction of
an entire building

104
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,400
and it looks like your
heading for coffee

105
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,080
and where in the hell is Reece?

106
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,080
(slow dramatic music)

107
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,920
(cries)

108
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,320
- Bad news Mr. Walker?
- We didn't get the stones,

109
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,840
Mr. Sloan.
- I seriously hope

110
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,880
that you're kidding.

111
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,000
- The police showed up,
there was a shootout,

112
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,760
we had to blow the building.

113
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,520
Ray went down,
Ronnie was shot too.

114
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,400
- All clean?

115
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,800
- Yeah, the cops
don't have anybody

116
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,120
but there's no sign of Bobby.

117
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,880
- Bobby?
- He was holding the diamonds.

118
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,000
- Are you telling me that Bobby

119
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,680
never got out of the building.

120
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,920
- Well, I don't
know but somebody

121
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,880
must have tipped the
police about the heist.

122
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:42,200
- And you think that
Bobby gave us up.

123
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,600
- I'm checking a few things but-

124
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:46,040
- Okay do you remember before
we made our arrangement,

125
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,360
I warned you and your men

126
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,720
of the consequences of
failure (indistinct).

127
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,240
- Yes you did.

128
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,680
- Don't think because
of the success

129
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:55,000
of our arrangement
that I'm growing soft

130
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,840
on this result in
anyway whatsoever.

131
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,000
- I understand.
- Good.

132
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,160
(dramatic music)

133
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:41,120
- No, no, Charles, they
know, our cover's blown!

134
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,600
(hollers)

135
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:06,440
(dramatic music)

136
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,160
(explosion)

137
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,640
(sirens wail)

138
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,960
- What happened out there, Jim?

139
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,480
- For Christ's sake Doane,
this is the men's room.

140
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,800
- What the hell happened?

141
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,040
- We were tracking
jewelry thieves.

142
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,960
- Jewelry thieves.

143
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,240
Are you still working
on Charles' murder?

144
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,480
- Not really.

145
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,920
- That was three years ago.

146
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,320
- We had a tip there
was gonna be a heist

147
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,200
from a reliable
source, I thought.

148
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,080
- So what happened to Reece?

149
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,600
- The source went
sour, dispatch called,

150
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:02,480
they were are perps but
on the wrong side of town.

151
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,520
- Reece?

152
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,720
- He's dead.

153
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,720
One of the thieves shot
him during a heist.

154
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,960
They had the building
rigged, I had no choice,

155
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,440
I had to leave him.

156
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,000
- So, he's still in the
building or what's left of it.

157
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,960
- He was dead before I left him.

158
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,520
- So, what they took
down the whole building

159
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,840
just to cover their tracks?

160
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,440
- Looks that way.

161
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,640
I've been telling
everybody all along,

162
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,600
these guys are ex-military.

163
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:38,040
- Well, from what they found
out they know what they want.

164
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,640
I mean, they didn't touch
anything in the cases,

165
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,800
they went right to the vault.

166
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,680
- With military
precision, I'm sure.

167
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,320
- They didn't touch anything
in the fault either,

168
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,560
they left it all alone
except this little black case

169
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,680
that was in there.

170
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,600
The jeweler, he
didn't know anything,

171
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,120
so I checked with
the insurance company

172
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,720
and the records said that
that little black case

173
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,760
contained $100 million
worth of diamonds,

174
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,560
fresh in from South Africa.

175
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,080
- Then we were set up.
- Set up?

176
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:03,040
- Sort of, it's more like
the thieves were set up.

177
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,800
I mean, we've never
been that close before,

178
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,320
then all of a sudden
there's a tip.

179
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,320
- No, I checked with dispatch,
there was no information,

180
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,320
it was an anonymous call.

181
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,400
- Right.

182
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,400
- Jim, look stay out of
this, this is my case.

183
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,360
- Well, that's what
I did last time

184
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,960
and look how well it went.

185
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,480
- Jim, go home.

186
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,480
Two dead partners
in three years.

187
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,800
Internal affairs is
gonna get on your-

188
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:35,560
- Cates, Cates, where
the hell did you go?

189
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,080
Who the hell do
you think you are

190
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,760
in leaving the scene like a-

191
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,240
- I went to tell Lianne.

192
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,680
- Listen, Jim, I'm
really sorry about Reece.

193
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,920
- I spoke for the-

194
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,040
- But you're off the
case, you know that.

195
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,720
- Standard procedure.
- Right, go home,

196
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:53,960
you need a rest.

197
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,080
There's going to be
an IED investigation.

198
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,680
- I know the drill.

199
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,600
At least we recovered
the diamonds.

200
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,000
- No, they weren't found.

201
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,520
- What?

202
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:05,880
- Where are the diamonds?
- Walker, I don't know,

203
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,640
Ronnie panicked, he
said, "I'm out of here,

204
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:13,680
the cops are everywhere," he
grabbed the diamonds and ran.

205
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:17,040
- So if you panicked, why
didn't you pick the stones up?

206
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,920
- Because I went the other way,
the cops were on my ass too.

207
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:22,560
- So you both panicked.
- Answer him!

208
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:27,960
- No, I went the other way
to try to draw the cops

209
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:30,720
of off them, give them a
chance to get out of there.

210
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,880
Hell the diamonds are probably
still there somewhere.

211
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:37,120
Walker, Colonel Sloan's
made me feel like

212
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,800
I have family here.

213
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,840
I got no reason to lie to him,

214
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,800
I got no reason to lie to you.

215
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:49,480
- Unless of course,
you stole the stones.

216
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,520
- Shut up.
- Walker.

217
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,920
- You see Bobby, I was
shot in the leg in Vietnam.

218
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,760
In so much pain I
couldn't get up,

219
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,080
we were caught in an ambush.

220
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:12,240
Our helicopter pilot was
killed, it was a mess.

221
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,080
Shots being fired
all over the place,

222
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:16,400
people screaming, total madness.

223
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,600
But before I knew it, I
was in that helicopter.

224
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,680
And you know why,
because Ron picked me up

225
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,240
and carried me
through all that crap.

226
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,680
So, if you think
I'm gonna believe

227
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:32,360
that ridiculous
story, well then,

228
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:36,960
I must not have
your full attention.

229
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:41,000
Now,
(grunts)

230
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:50,040
do I have your
full attention now?

231
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:54,520
(machinery running)

232
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,200
- Why did you change the
location, I was getting worried?

233
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:09,000
- So, you got them?
- Yeah, I got it.

234
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,280
Do you have my information?

235
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,320
- I'm sorry Megan.

236
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,080
- It's okay, Bobby, I
don't blame you, it's Sloan

237
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:17,240
who's gonna pay.
- They know.

238
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,160
- What?

239
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,160
- They're onto us, use the disk.

240
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,520
- What?
- Run, Megan, run, run!

241
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:23,120
- Get the broad, get the broad!

242
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,200
(hollers)

243
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,080
- Run!

244
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,520
(gun fires)

245
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,360
- That's for Ronnie, and
this is your last time

246
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,960
cruising the vault.

247
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:38,160
(dramatic music)

248
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,080
(hollers)

249
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,000
(grunts)

250
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,920
(climactic music)

251
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,920
(dramatic music)

252
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:56,720
- Okay Cates, thanks for
lunch but your time is up.

253
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:59,000
- Sam, I'll just
be another minute.

254
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:01,600
- Hey come on, you know
I can get in really deep

255
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,240
for letting you
look at these tapes.

256
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,880
Besides, Sarge is
looking for you.

257
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,360
- Tell her I'm not here.

258
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,520
- She's got a murder victim,
matches the description

259
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,680
of one of your thieves.

260
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:14,120
Cates did you hear me?

261
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,400
- What?
- I said

262
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,800
she needs you to make an
I.D. on one of the guys

263
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,240
that may have killed Reece.

264
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,760
- Yep, that's one of them.

265
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,920
- Are you sure Jim?

266
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:27,160
- No doubt, anybody
see anything?

267
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,600
- No, but we found
a can of mace down

268
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,120
at the other end of the mall.

269
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,840
- You got anything else?
- No, Jim, this is it.

270
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,840
I mean, it's been years but
that's really all we have.

271
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,400
- Brilliant police work Doane.

272
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,400
Are those cameras on?

273
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,080
- Yeah, we have it, they're
collecting the tapes now.

274
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,080
- I'm off.

275
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,120
Loss of the diamonds is
really disturbing me.

276
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,640
You have good news, I hope.

277
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:03,920
- Bobby double crossed us,
I had to eliminate him.

278
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,360
- Are you sure?

279
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,080
- I was very persuasive.

280
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,600
He gave up some woman
he was working with

281
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,000
apparently she still
has the diamonds.

282
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,880
- And you don't have
this woman do you?

283
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,000
- Not yet.

284
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,360
- Who is this woman?

285
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:19,480
- I'm not sure but she was
way out of Bobby's league.

286
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,760
- And you think this
woman planned all this.

287
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,080
- Perhaps.

288
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,680
- Well, you have
connections with the police,

289
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,960
why don't you find her?

290
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,920
There was this law firm, you see

291
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:34,720
and they were looking to
promote a new partner.

292
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,720
But they had to come up
with a rather ingenious test

293
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:39,400
to try their loyalty.

294
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,400
So they asked the candidates
to come back in the morning

295
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,600
with their wives, told them
to keep the wives outside.

296
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,080
And the desk they
had this pistol,

297
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,760
plus it was loaded with blanks.

298
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,040
They said to the fellow,
"Look, we're really

299
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,040
thinking about promoting you

300
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:54,200
to full partnership in this firm

301
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,720
but we want you to prove
your loyalty to us."

302
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,120
He said, "Well what
do I have to do?"

303
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,360
Said, "Well we want
you to take this gun,

304
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:04,080
go outside and shoot your wife."

305
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:06,000
Well the fellow was
appalled by this.

306
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,240
He paled, he stood up,
he broke out into a sweat

307
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:13,600
and he said, "I can't
do that" and he left.

308
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,880
They called the
second candidate in,

309
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,440
they asked him the same thing.

310
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,800
And the fellow said,
"What do I have to do?"

311
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:20,960
He said, "Well you
gotta take this pistol,

312
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,760
go outside and shoot your wife."

313
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,000
Of course he had
the same reaction,

314
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,760
he got up, he paled, he
broke out into a sweat

315
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:32,480
and he said, "I can't
do that" and he left.

316
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,040
They called candidate
number three in.

317
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,240
Told him the same thing, the
guy never dropped a beat.

318
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,160
He said, "Sure of course."

319
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:41,800
And he picked the gun
and he walked outside.

320
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,760
A few moments later they
heard three shots rang out.

321
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,960
And then a loud scuffling noise.

322
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,520
When he came back
into the office,

323
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,280
of course the senior
partners was sitting there

324
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:52,160
laughing at the joke
they pulled on him.

325
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,160
And they said, "How
did it work out?"

326
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,200
He said, "The damnest
thing happened,

327
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:00,200
the gun was full of blanks,
so I had to strangle her."

328
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,440
(laughs)

329
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,760
Now that's loyalty.

330
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:04,760
Jeff will you give
me those bullets.

331
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:05,640
- Yeah sir.

332
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,760
(bludgeoning)

333
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,720
- You know I was kinda
wondering why you were

334
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,600
putting with a nine iron.

335
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:25,200
- You're running
out of men, Walker,

336
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,640
next time you screw up,

337
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,600
you're gonna have to suffer
the consequences alone.

338
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,600
- There won't be
anymore screw ups.

339
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,640
But I took out Cates'
partner at the heist,

340
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,600
so he may turn into
a slight problem.

341
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,480
- Did he see you?
- No.

342
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,720
- Well you know how
to deal with Cates

343
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:42,160
and the woman, once
you get the stones

344
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:45,160
do what you do best,
incinerate her.

345
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,960
- I had such a great
time, thank you both

346
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,640
for a wonderful birthday.

347
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,920
- Hey I never pass up the
chance for a free meal.

348
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:55,000
Not with my favorite
sister and brother-in-law.

349
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,880
- Typical Raines girls
ordering lobster.

350
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,560
- Hey you did pick
a good one, sis,

351
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:01,320
I mean, the guys I go out with
don't even spring for dinner.

352
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:05,000
- Sarah, thank you so much
for the necklace, I love it.

353
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,760
You are so creative.

354
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,440
- I only got one big sis.

355
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,360
Now where are we going, it's
early, how about a club?

356
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,560
- Oh no, no way Sarah.

357
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,920
It's been a long
day (indistinct).

358
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,280
- Come on, totally.
- Forget it, I can't do.

359
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,520
There's no way.
- Oh no, I forgot my pick

360
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,080
at the table, I'll
be right back.

361
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,360
- I'll get it.

362
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,040
- No, no, I got
it, I'll be back.

363
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,800
- So, Rick, do you really
think she liked the necklace?

364
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,080
- She loved it, Sarah.

365
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,560
(engine starts)

366
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,840
(car explodes)

367
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,360
- No, no, no, no!

368
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:42,360
(car explodes)

369
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,440
(gasps)

370
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,640
(cries)

371
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:52,120
(slow music)

372
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,240
(car engine revs)

373
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,720
- Hurry up, hurry up.
- Let me see,

374
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:38,760
I gotta get this right so it'll
explode with the ignition.

375
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,720
- Those cops, toast.

376
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:46,040
- I got it, Jim,
this is really weird.

377
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,640
- What do you mean?

378
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,680
- The lady in this
photo is dead.

379
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,800
- Dead, sure doesn't
look dead to me.

380
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,000
- The photo matches
a Megan Marlow.

381
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,560
According to our records, she
and her husband were killed

382
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,960
in a suspicious
explosion two years ago.

383
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:03,040
Anyway, she was married to a
Rick Marlow, big time lawyer.

384
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:06,840
Whoa, they were loaded,
penthouse on 90th and Second,

385
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:09,840
houses in the Caribbean,
properties all over the world.

386
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,840
Only living relative is
Sara Raines, her sister.

387
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,760
No known address on file.

388
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,560
But someone is
still paying taxes

389
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,520
on the property in Vermont.

390
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,800
- There you go, Jim.

391
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:25,080
- Whoa, could use a
zoom in on her neck.

392
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:28,600
- Sure.
- Right there, the necklace.

393
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,680
Are those letters?

394
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:36,200
- Look like two M's to me.

395
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,400
- Two M's.

396
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:45,560
I'll be damned, Megan Marlow.

397
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,200
Where did you say
that property was?

398
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,920
- Up in Vermont.
- Vermont.

399
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,680
(dramatic music)

400
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:18,680
- Hey where's Cates?

401
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,880
- He just left, I
think he was headed

402
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,680
for the impound garage.
- Jesus.

403
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:25,640
(dramatic music)

404
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,240
- Cates.
- What?

405
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,440
- Where the hell you going?

406
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,520
- Home, you just got done
telling me I had to go home.

407
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,960
- I just grilled Sammy, if
you think you're following

408
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,920
this case to Vermont forget it.

409
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:01,240
(dramatic music)

410
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:04,040
- Look, I'm gonna take
a couple of days off,

411
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,440
I need it after all
that's happened.

412
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:07,240
- Just don't make it
a Vermont vacation,

413
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,800
this is Doane's case now.

414
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,480
- I'm not gonna do
anything stupid,

415
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:11,960
I need a couple of days
for myself, that's all.

416
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,560
- I know what you're thinking,

417
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:15,800
you're thinking you're the
only one with enough passion

418
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,720
to crack this case, well
forget it, you're burned out.

419
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,160
I've seen it before.

420
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:23,040
You go anywhere near this
case, you'll hurt our chances

421
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:25,360
of getting any real
justice for Reece.

422
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:28,560
- Real justice, I haven't
seen any real justice

423
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,560
since I joined the force.

424
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:33,400
- The system works eventually
Cates, leave it alone.

425
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:36,080
- Thanks for the advice.

426
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:39,360
- I'm giving you a
warning now, take it.

427
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,640
(dramatic music)

428
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,560
- Cates, stop, Jesus,
I almost missed you.

429
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,800
- What's wrong.

430
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,760
- I know you're
going to Vermont.

431
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,840
- No I'm not.

432
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,640
- Yes you are, I know you.

433
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:02,240
This is the file of
the interrogations

434
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,160
of the jewelry store customers.

435
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:07,280
It may help.
- Thanks.

436
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,160
- Yeah, well, just don't
let the dragon lady know

437
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,480
that I gave it to you and
if you find anything out,

438
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:15,000
you let me know about it.
- You got it.

439
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:17,800
(dramatic music)

440
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:29,520
(dramatic music)

441
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:44,360
21531, there's this
guy, Nero there

442
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,720
that you should talk
to, hold on a second.

443
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:47,600
What are you doing?

444
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,800
- Where are the keys

445
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:49,960
to the blue Miata you
impounded yesterday?

446
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,120
- Why?
- I need a loaner.

447
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,760
- What happened to your car?

448
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,560
- I had a little engine trouble.

449
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,640
- Jim, you cannot take that car.

450
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,640
What do expect me to do,
hold the paperwork on it?

451
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,520
- Yeah.
- Cates, Cates,

452
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:05,840
I'm only gonna hold
it for three days.

453
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,640
(dramatic music)

454
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:14,440
(dramatic music)

455
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:24,000
- Hello there, how
can I help you?

456
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,880
- I'm hoping you can, officer,

457
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,440
my name is Jim Cates, I'm
a detective from New York.

458
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:32,440
- Yeah, Deputy Lewis
Ross, pleased to meet you.

459
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,680
- Nice to meet you too.

460
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,520
- What brings you
all the way up here?

461
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,800
- Well, I'm working on
a very important case

462
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,520
and I have reason to
believe that the suspect

463
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,080
is residing in this area.

464
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:43,200
- Dang, I wouldn't raise
the hassles on a dead dog.

465
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,480
- Sheriff Taylor.
- What?

466
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,720
- This is Detective-
- Cates, Jim Cates.

467
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,560
- Detective Cates from the NYPD.

468
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,520
- New York, huh?

469
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,800
Well, Detective Cates, to
what do we owe the pleasure

470
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,200
of this visit?

471
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,800
- Well, as I was just
explaining to your deputy here,

472
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,680
I'm working on a
very important case.

473
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:00,440
I believe the suspect
is living in this area.

474
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,880
She look familiar to you?

475
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,640
- She look familiar to you?
- Yeah.

476
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:05,720
- (laughs) You got yourself

477
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,360
a real hardened criminal
there, detective.

478
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,520
- A real mean one.

479
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:11,160
- Look, I'm not exactly
sure what's so funny

480
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:13,080
but this is a very
serious matter.

481
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:15,120
- Look, detective the
woman in that photograph

482
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,600
is Sarah Raines, she happens

483
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,880
to be a very well-respected
member of our community.

484
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,680
- Sarah Raines.
- Uh-huh.

485
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,880
- It's Megan Marlow.

486
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,960
- No, no, no, you
have been living on

487
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,440
that cement island too long.

488
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:27,120
I'm telling you the
woman in that photograph

489
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,680
is Sarah Raines.

490
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:31,440
Hell she just donated a
library to this community.

491
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,320
- Well, could you please tell
me where I might find her.

492
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,600
- Louis.

493
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,960
- She has a place north
of here about five miles

494
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,680
outside of town.

495
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,200
Big white house with a red barn.

496
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,200
- Big red barn out
back, you can't miss it.

497
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,040
- Thank you.

498
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,200
- Oh and Detective Cates,
when you get out there,

499
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:49,440
you be careful, I understand
she's armed and dangerous.

500
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:52,240
(dramatic music)

501
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:08,200
(engines rev)

502
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,920
- I know I've been away, I
know, I'm gonna take you both

503
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,600
for some exercise.

504
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,760
(dramatic music)

505
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:25,880
(knocks)
- Hello?

506
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:30,600
(knocks)
Hello?

507
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,080
Anybody home, hello?

508
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:49,280
(banging)
(grunts)

509
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,280
- Who the hell are you?

510
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:58,120
- Do you always hit first
and ask questions later?

511
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,440
- You broke into
my house, dip shit,

512
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,720
face the floor, put your
hands over your head.

513
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:03,760
- Look, my name is Jim
Cates, I'm a detective

514
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,280
from New York City.
- How long have you

515
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,680
been working for Sloan?
- I'm a cop, check my I.D.

516
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:11,240
- Sloan owns a lot of badges.
- Sloan and you ripped

517
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:16,760
him off, very smooth, only
you got my partner killed

518
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,320
and your friend,
Bobby is dead too.

519
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,920
I hope it was worth it, Megan.

520
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,200
- What do you want?

521
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:24,840
- You're gonna help me
get this guy, Sloan.

522
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,400
(gun fires)

523
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:29,200
(dramatic music)

524
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:37,000
I miss the city all ready.

525
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,160
- Come on.

526
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:49,600
- Damn.

527
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,080
Come on, come on, whoa.

528
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:58,400
Yee-ha!

529
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:03,240
(gun fires)
- Oh damn.

530
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,840
- Hey, hey, hold
up, stop, police.

531
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:20,520
(dramatic music)

532
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:22,680
Come on!

533
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:24,840
Oh, oh, oh.

534
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:34,920
Pull over, stop, you
are under arrest.

535
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:47,120
(thumps)
(grunts)

536
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,400
- [Man] Hello Detective Cates.

537
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,320
- Oh great.

538
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,080
- You can't ride
for shit, Cates.

539
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,320
- Where's the girl?

540
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:01,200
- Gone, how the
hell should I know?

541
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,320
- You sure?

542
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,560
- Okay, you got me,

543
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:04,880
she's behind one of
the trees over there.

544
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,480
Why don't you go take a look?

545
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,960
- (laughs) Sorry, funny
man, that was the only thing

546
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,680
keeping you alive.

547
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:11,880
(police sirens wail)

548
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:12,840
- Come on, come on.

549
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:13,680
- Next time Cates.

550
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,320
- Come on, come on.

551
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,600
- Are you okay?
- I'll make it.

552
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,000
What the hell are you
two doing here anyway?

553
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,240
- Saving your bacon I'd say son.

554
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,280
Look, Mr. Cates, I
think it's about time

555
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,440
you leveled with us.

556
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:35,800
Suppose you tell me just exactly

557
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,360
what's going on around here.

558
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:39,520
- Well, I'm sure by now
even you and Goober here

559
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:42,080
has figured out that
those are the bad guys

560
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:44,080
and they're after Sarah
Raines or Megan Marlow

561
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,880
or whatever her name
is just like I am.

562
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,280
- But why?

563
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,880
- She's a suspect in a
jewelry heist I'm working on.

564
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,520
- Mrs. Raines ain't no thief.

565
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:52,440
- Well that's something I have

566
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:54,520
to find out for myself deputy.

567
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:56,600
Besides by now those
thugs have figured out

568
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,920
that Sarah Raines
is Megan Marlow.

569
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,240
- All right, all right,
let's go get this cleared up

570
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,480
once and for all.

571
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,760
If she's a thief and if
she is trying to escape,

572
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,440
I think I know
where she's headed.

573
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,400
- Where?

574
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:10,200
- Well, she's a pilot, now I
may not be a big city detective

575
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:13,680
but I'd say the air field is
a real good place to start.

576
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,720
(banging)

577
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,760
(glass breaks)

578
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,480
- Hey, got something.

579
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:36,400
Oh what do we got
there, let's find out.

580
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:45,120
Library card, credit cards,
son of a bitch, Megan Marlow.

581
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,040
- You're kidding.

582
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:50,840
(dramatic music)

583
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:57,920
(police sirens blare)

584
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,600
- I'm sorry about this Sarah.

585
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,000
- What the hell's
going on sheriff?

586
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,520
- I've got this detective
from New York City,

587
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:12,160
he said he needs to ask
you a few questions,

588
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,600
would you mind
stepping in the car.

589
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:15,120
- Look sheriff, that
man broke into my house

590
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:16,080
and he assaulted me,

591
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,600
I don't know
- Oh no, Megan,

592
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,880
what this is all about but-
you're the one that clocked me

593
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:19,680
with those vase remember?
- You must

594
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,200
have the wrong person.

595
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:22,480
I told you my name
is Sarah Raines.

596
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,320
- Please Mrs. Raines,
just get in the car,

597
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,640
we can clear this
up at the station.

598
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:26,840
You're not in any trouble.

599
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,000
- Yet.

600
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,320
- They located the
woman in Vermont.

601
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:42,440
Ray and Mack followed
Cates right to her.

602
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:46,880
You're not gonna believe
this, it's Rick Marlow's wife.

603
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:47,880
She's alive.

604
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:58,440
- Megan, alive that
tenacious bitch.

605
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:03,000
But it figures Bobby
and Rick were friends.

606
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,120
You better get up to Vermont
and look at this personally.

607
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,600
- I'm on my way.

608
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:10,840
- And Walker, you bring
those diamonds back to me.

609
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:13,360
Then terminate Megan Marlow.

610
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:18,440
- I feel bad about this Sarah.
- It's not your fault sheriff.

611
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:21,080
- So Megan, where
are the diamonds?

612
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:22,440
- Quit calling me that.

613
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,760
- Planning on financing
another town structure or what?

614
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:25,840
- It seems that I
should get a lawyer

615
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,080
before talking to you.

616
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:28,280
- Well, why don't you
tell me about those guys

617
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,920
chasing you earlier today.

618
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,400
Looks like your
double cross backfired

619
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,960
in that pretty
little face of yours.

620
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,720
- Looks like they
followed you to me.

621
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,920
- Looks like we've got
somebody up here needs a hand.

622
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:39,800
- It's them.

623
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:43,720
- Sheriff, it's them.
- Who?

624
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:45,400
- Those guys from the woods.

625
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,800
- Is that so?

626
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,480
You know I'd kinda like
to talk to those boys.

627
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:51,600
- Look, these guys are pros,

628
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:53,600
I guarantee they
don't play around.

629
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:54,960
- Neither do I.

630
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,920
- Look out sheriff!

631
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,400
(dramatic music)

632
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,720
(crashing)

633
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,800
(dramatic music)

634
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,480
(grunts)

635
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:33,320
- Are you all right?
- I think so.

636
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:36,200
- You guys?
- I'm all right

637
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:37,680
but the sheriff.

638
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,120
- Get him out of there, they're
gonna be back any second.

639
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:40,560
- Deputy there's
nothing you can do,

640
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:43,120
they're right behind
us, come on, let's go.

641
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:45,000
- Hey, I don't know what
the hell you two are into

642
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,160
but I'm safer
anywhere you're not

643
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:48,600
and I'm not leaving
the sheriff, now leave!

644
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:49,480
- There's nothing.

645
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:50,440
- Just go!

646
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:54,600
(dramatic music)

647
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:02,720
(gun fires)

648
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:10,960
(hollers)

649
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:18,520
- Come on, come on, let's go.

650
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:21,360
(dramatic music)

651
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:31,120
Whoa, whoa!

652
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:32,440
- What the hell are
you doing anyway!

653
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:33,360
- Police, there's
been an accident.

654
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:34,480
- What?
- Push over.

655
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:36,000
- What are you doing?

656
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:37,240
- Push over John Boy, I'm
commandeering your vehicle.

657
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:40,160
(climactic music)

658
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,680
Okay, Megan, I think
it's time you and I talk

659
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:46,600
before the body
count rises any more.

660
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:47,960
- What the hell's going on here?

661
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:49,600
- Sloan killed my
husband and my sister.

662
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:52,160
- I kinda figured that,
a little revenge, huh?

663
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:53,320
- A little justice.

664
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:55,040
- Don't confuse
revenge with justice,

665
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,600
you'll never get
the same results.

666
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:58,200
- Why don't you just let me
out right here somewhere.

667
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,600
- Look, I'll tell you
what I know about Sloan

668
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:01,000
if you promise to help me out.

669
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,680
- I don't make
promises to criminals.

670
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:03,760
- I'm not a criminal.

671
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:07,320
(dramatic music)

672
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:08,280
- Oh geeze.

673
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:16,520
Get out of the truck.

674
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:32,440
- What the hell are you doing!

675
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:37,880
(explodes)

676
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:41,920
Holy Judas priest!

677
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:45,600
(dramatic music)

678
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:48,600
- Come on get in.

679
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:54,040
It's not safe on the
ground here anymore.

680
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:55,560
- What do you mean?

681
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:59,120
- Hey, sorry about your tank
and we're taking your truck.

682
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:03,640
- Oh yeah, go ahead, I was
gonna get a new one anyway.

683
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:07,440
(dramatic music)

684
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:22,120
- Damn tourists.

685
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:26,080
- Cates, you better
know how to fly

686
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:27,680
because I know you don't
think I'm stupid enough

687
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:29,160
to fly myself to prison.

688
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:31,800
- Just get us in the air,
we'll talk about a deal later.

689
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:44,320
So who is this Sloan?

690
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:49,440
Megan, Megan.
- What?

691
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:52,680
- Sloan, who is Sloan?

692
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:55,160
- He used to be my
husband's law partner.

693
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:59,360
He set up this thievery ring
using some of his old platoon.

694
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:02,040
When my husband, Rick learned
that Sloan was involved

695
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:04,520
with underworld people,
he confronted him

696
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:06,840
and soon after Sloan
planted a bomb in our car

697
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:08,560
to kill Rick and me.

698
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:10,320
Instead he killed
Rick and Sarah.

699
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:12,040
- Your sister.
- Yeah.

700
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:16,520
So, I wasn't gonna wait
around for Sloan's militia

701
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:19,640
to take another shot, so I
took my sister's identity.

702
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:22,720
- Sarah Raines, how'd
you manage that anyway?

703
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:24,520
- I was next of kin.

704
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:26,040
I identified the
body as I helped

705
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:29,800
transfer the dental records,
it was surprisingly easy.

706
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:34,560
I waited for the right
chance to really hurt Sloan.

707
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:37,480
Bobby wanted out, he
needed cash to disappear,

708
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:39,320
so he was gonna
take the diamonds,

709
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:42,200
in return give me my
husband's computer files.

710
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:43,480
- Computer files.

711
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:46,360
- Enough information to
put Sloan away forever.

712
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:48,960
- Only they killed Bobby first.

713
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,720
- Hmm-mm, I got the information,

714
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:54,080
now all I need is the
opportunity to use it.

715
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:55,640
- What information, where is it?

716
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:57,520
- I'll tell you when you
can give me some assurances.

717
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:58,960
I'm not going to jail Cates.

718
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,320
- First the diamonds.

719
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:02,520
- What are you gonna do for me?

720
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:05,120
And stay away from oxymorons
like witness protection.

721
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:07,560
- It depends on what kind
of information you have

722
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:10,760
and we have to have the
stones back, of course.

723
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:12,040
- Uh-huh and then I go free?
- I can't make any promises.

724
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:15,000
- Well, then neither can I.

725
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,880
- Look, Megan, Sloan has
already cost the lives

726
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:19,120
of three police officers,
not to mention the fact,

727
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:21,960
what was that?
- I don't know.

728
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:23,640
- What do you mean, you
don't know, you're the pilot,

729
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:25,160
you're supposed to know
about the aircraft.

730
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:26,680
- I'm losing oil pressure.
- What does that mean

731
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:29,000
losing oil pressure?
- We're losing altitude,

732
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,520
practically damn, those thugs
must have sabotaged the plane.

733
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:33,840
- You don't check the oil
before you go up in the air?

734
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:35,320
- There's no good
place to set down.

735
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:36,720
- How could you let this happen?

736
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:38,680
- We didn't have time
for a pre-flight check.

737
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:40,480
- Oh how long does it
take to check the oil?

738
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:42,160
- Look, there are
parachutes in the back.

739
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:43,600
- Oh no, I'm not jumping out
of a complete (indistinct).

740
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:46,280
- I don't have time to argue
with you, just grab them.

741
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:48,480
- Oh man, I can't even believe
you would suggest something-

742
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:50,480
- I'm trying to save
your life, just put it on

743
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:51,720
and snap the buckles.
- Here take this.

744
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:53,880
- I do not consider this
the sensible solution

745
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:55,440
to an oil problem.

746
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:57,480
- I'm gonna make a bit of a
dive, pick up some altitude.

747
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:59,400
When I say jump, you jump.

748
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:00,880
- You first.

749
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:02,640
- I'll be right
behind you Cates.

750
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:04,800
Just remember to pull your
cord as soon as you get out.

751
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:07,680
Okay, go.

752
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:09,240
- All right, I'm
gonna go just let me-

753
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:10,720
- Go damn it!
- All right,

754
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:13,200
don't yell at me, for crying
out loud, I'm gonna go.

755
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:20,600
(hollers)

756
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:26,920
Oh I'm gonna die!

757
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:29,240
Where's the ground?

758
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:32,360
Where's the thing,
where's the thing?

759
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:36,400
(hollers)

760
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:46,560
Thank you God!

761
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:50,400
(laughs)

762
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:53,960
- Whew!

763
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:54,840
Oh boy.

764
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:59,440
(dramatic music)

765
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:08,120
This stupid thing
worked. (laughs)

766
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:21,440
(grunts)

767
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:35,640
- Jump Megan, jump.

768
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:38,280
What are you waiting for?

769
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:41,120
(dramatic music)

770
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,040
- Oh, bitch.

771
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:03,600
Low-life, dirty, rotten,
sneaky, conniving little bitch!

772
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:09,160
Lying little spoiled brat!

773
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:12,480
Slut, lying brat,
spoiled little bitch!

774
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:31,720
- Thanks for picking me up.

775
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:33,280
- No problem, thanks for
letting me drive your car.

776
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:34,960
- Are you okay?

777
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,040
- Yep.

778
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:41,280
- Hey, I'm sorry about the
sheriff, if I had known.

779
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:43,720
- Yeah, me too.

780
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:45,840
Well, I talked to the feds.

781
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:48,360
- Oh great.

782
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:51,880
- They're sending
up two men tomorrow.

783
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:54,360
I'll let you explain
all this to them.

784
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:57,720
What she'd do make you jump?

785
00:50:57,760 --> 00:50:58,880
That's funny.

786
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:02,600
- Take me to Megan's.
- What for?

787
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:03,520
- Clues.

788
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:07,280
(dramatic music)

789
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:17,880
- Looks like we
missed the party.

790
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:22,320
- Well, let's start looking.

791
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:25,440
- What am I looking for?

792
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:27,080
- Clues.
- Like what?

793
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:28,800
- You'll know them
when you see them.

794
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:32,000
- So, what's it like
being a New York cop?

795
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,160
- It's all right.

796
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:34,960
- Must be a rush.
- Yeah.

797
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:56,440
- Well, well, well,
well, well, well,

798
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:58,880
if is isn't Amelia Earhart.

799
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:01,520
- Deputy Cates, it's
lovely to see you again?

800
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:03,600
Did you have a nice fall?

801
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:05,720
- Good to see you too, Megan.

802
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:08,480
Now what on Earth would bring
you all the way back here?

803
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:11,280
- I came back for my wallet,
nice job with my house.

804
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:13,760
- We didn't do it but somebody
was looking for something.

805
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:16,120
- Well, thanks for stopping by

806
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:17,400
but I bet you still
don't got a warrant

807
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:19,320
so why don't you get
the hell out of my home.

808
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:21,480
- All right, but
you're coming with us.

809
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:23,440
- What are you doing, get
your hands off me, deputy.

810
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:25,040
- Cuffs, give me your cuffs.
- Deputy!

811
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:27,200
- I'm really sorry, Miss Raines.

812
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:31,160
- You have no right to do this.

813
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:33,440
- I don't want you
shoving me out of the car.

814
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,520
- [Deputy] Are you sure
you wanna stay here.

815
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:38,280
We could put you both up at
the station under protection.

816
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:40,720
- No, we'll be fine.
- All right, see you

817
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:42,360
in the morning.
- Yeah, thanks.

818
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:48,000
- Hey.
- Sorry Megan.

819
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:51,160
You can deal with
the feds from now on.

820
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:53,360
- You weren't ever gonna keep
up with your end of the deal.

821
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:55,600
You don't even have the
authority to negotiate.

822
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:58,480
- Look, I've been chasing these
thieves and your man, Sloan

823
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:00,800
for over three years.

824
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:02,480
It's cost the lives
of my two partners,

825
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:04,680
both very good friends.

826
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:06,960
Not to mention, it's
ruined my career

827
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:09,040
and countless innocence
people have been shot-

828
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:10,720
- Oh geeze, what an
insensitive person I've been.

829
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:12,520
I just lost my whole family.

830
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:14,960
(slow music)

831
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:28,360
- Look, Megan, I
know how you feel.

832
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:34,000
My first partner and
I grew up together.

833
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:38,920
We went to the same school,
we were in the service

834
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:39,840
at the same time.

835
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:46,440
And we graduated from the
police academy together.

836
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:47,640
And then we were partners.

837
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:53,720
We spent more time together
than anyone in the whole world.

838
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:56,640
He was family.

839
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:02,160
And then a guy like
Sloan snaps his fingers

840
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:06,560
and everything changes.

841
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:13,240
We're on the same side, Megan,

842
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:16,800
we want the same thing, Sloan.

843
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:23,840
You give me the information
and the diamonds

844
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:27,680
and I'll let you disappear.

845
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:31,520
I would have never heard of
Sarah Raines or Megan Marlow.

846
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:36,960
And I promise, I will get Sloan.

847
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:41,080
- Why should I trust you,

848
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:43,160
you could just take
the diamonds and run.

849
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:46,520
(slow music)

850
00:54:57,600 --> 00:54:59,920
- Please, help me get Sloan.

851
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:09,560
- Okay but this is between
you and me only, no feds.

852
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:10,800
- Deal.
- Deal.

853
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:14,720
(slow music)

854
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:34,640
(slow music)

855
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:04,280
(helicopter whirling)

856
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:20,280
- Let's go.

857
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:25,160
(dramatic music)

858
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:55,520
- Good morning.

859
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:02,520
- That was a mean trick,
Megan, I thought you left.

860
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:04,960
- Come on, let's go
get some breakfast.

861
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,800
(dramatic music)

862
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:12,920
- Key.
- What?

863
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:14,440
- Key.
- Oh.

864
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:19,000
- Look, the sheriff's been
killed, there's dogs lost

865
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:19,880
all over the-
- Hello sheriff.

866
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:21,360
- Good morning.

867
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:24,360
Look I can't talk right now,
I'm acting Deputy Styles.

868
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:25,840
- Deputy Styles.
- Somebody else

869
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:28,600
has just come in here so,
yeah, take it easy, bye.

870
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:29,800
- Deputy Styles, we're
looking for a couple of-

871
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:32,280
- I know why you're
here, Deputy Ross

872
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:34,120
telephoned headquarters
this morning.

873
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:35,640
Didn't he inform you?
- No.

874
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:38,880
- Well, Detective Cates
has the girl, Miss Marlow

875
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:40,640
down at the inn,
they're waiting for you.

876
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:43,520
- Oh yes, of course, our radios
must have been out of range.

877
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:45,240
Now where's that
inn located again?

878
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:48,000
- Down the road a mile,
about on the right.

879
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:51,200
- Thank deputy, you don't know
how big a help you've been.

880
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:53,800
- They've got a great
breakfast if you haven't eaten.

881
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:57,400
- Who are they?
- The feds,

882
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:59,040
I sent them to the inn.
- Oh good.

883
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:01,920
(dramatic music)

884
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:10,520
(knocks)

885
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:16,200
- Hi, how you doing?

886
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:17,480
- Federal Agent, Zachary,

887
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:19,320
I'm looking for
Detective Jim Cates.

888
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:21,880
- Damn, it's good to
see a friendly face.

889
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:23,120
- Well, it's good to be here.

890
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:25,960
Your department in
New York updated me.

891
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:31,080
Your sergeant is really pissed,
so do you have the girl?

892
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:34,360
- No, she ditched me.
- What?

893
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:37,040
- But I have a plan, I
just need a couple of hours

894
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:38,600
to follow it up,
that's all I need.

895
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:39,840
- Well, if the girl's not
here, I gotta make a report.

896
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:41,320
- Just a couple of
hours, come on now.

897
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:42,600
- That's against
policy, you know that.

898
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:45,320
Look, I've been working
on this for three years.

899
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:48,640
One hour.
- All right,

900
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:50,640
one hour but that's it.

901
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:51,520
- Great.

902
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:55,840
Oh and I need to
borrow your car.

903
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:58,600
(dramatic music)

904
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:15,160
- Can you believe that
deputy, what an idiot.

905
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:17,000
That's them!

906
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:22,760
- This is the place, right?
- Yeah, this is it,

907
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:24,960
my husband used to own
shares in this company.

908
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:26,880
There, pull over there.

909
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:46,320
- Uh-oh.

910
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:50,840
(dramatic music)

911
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:08,800
Charles, it can't be.

912
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:10,600
- Great to see you again, Jimmy.

913
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:12,400
- Charles.
- Who?

914
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:17,520
- Charles Walker, my
partner, my dead partner.

915
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:21,720
- Not quite, Jimmy,
now drop the gun.

916
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:23,960
- Tell me you're not involved.

917
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:26,760
- I'm afraid so Jim,
the pay's much better

918
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:30,520
and being the bad guy,
much more interesting.

919
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:32,240
- I'll kill you.

920
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:36,080
- You can get one of
us, but the other two

921
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:37,200
are sure to get Megan.

922
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:43,960
- How much did it take,
how much did it take

923
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,640
to buy your loyalty,
to kill Reece?

924
01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:48,280
- You know Jimmy,
I'm not in the mood

925
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:52,240
for a morality sermon from a
washed-up burnout like you.

926
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:53,760
So, I'll tell you
what I'm gonna do.

927
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:57,360
I'm gonna take the jewels
and your little friend here

928
01:00:57,360 --> 01:01:00,680
and I'm gonna have these
guys kill you, how's that?

929
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:02,760
- You'll never get away with it.

930
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:04,200
The feds are involved.

931
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:06,960
- Bury him in that cheap little
piece of shit down there!

932
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:08,880
- Come on, move it, move it!

933
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:13,000
- Okay, sweetie pie, I'm
gonna make sure you're gone

934
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:14,640
for good this time.

935
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:16,640
- You kill me and
Sloan goes down.

936
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:18,080
- Nice try.

937
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:20,040
- Bobby passed me Rick's
disk before you killed him.

938
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:21,920
The disk contained a good
portion of the affidavit

939
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:23,440
he was preparing on Sloan.

940
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:25,680
Some account numbers on
Switzerland and the Caymans

941
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:29,720
and oh yes, a very
interesting file on you.

942
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:31,600
- So, what do you want?

943
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:34,440
- You let Cates go and
then I talk to Sloan.

944
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:35,920
- It's too late for Cates.

945
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:39,000
But I like you, you have spunk.

946
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:42,560
- Now look this is your
last chance to surrender,

947
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:44,840
the feds will be swarming this
place in just a little while.

948
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:46,560
- Oh how will the feds
like if I did that huh!

949
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:48,280
- Get in the car, stand up!

950
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:49,560
- Let's bury him!

951
01:01:49,560 --> 01:01:50,760
Get in the car!

952
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:53,520
(dramatic music)

953
01:01:56,440 --> 01:01:58,320
Fasten your seatbelt.

954
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:00,960
- You better give good phone,

955
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,920
'cause if Sloan doesn't
believe you, you're dead.

956
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:06,400
I've got the diamonds Mr. Sloan.

957
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:08,680
- Good Charles, very good.

958
01:02:08,680 --> 01:02:10,920
By the way did you take
care of our problems?

959
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:14,160
- Megan claims she's holding
some information on you.

960
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:15,840
- Put her on the phone.

961
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:21,640
Hello, Megan, my, my, my
you are a clever girl.

962
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:23,720
We thought you died
in the accident.

963
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:29,600
- Cut the crap, I've
got Rick's disk.

964
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:31,600
- So?
- So, I want Detective Cates

965
01:02:31,640 --> 01:02:32,600
let go.

966
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:35,080
(dramatic music)

967
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:37,000
If you kill me the
documents will automatically

968
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,480
be sent to the feds.

969
01:02:38,520 --> 01:02:41,480
- Oh come on Megan, why on
Earth would I believe you.

970
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:44,720
- The Caymans' account password
is roughcut, sound familiar?

971
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:46,680
- What do you want?

972
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:49,360
- You took everything from
me Sloan, I want justice.

973
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:52,160
(machinery runs)

974
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:58,080
- You return the disk to
me and I'll let you live,

975
01:02:58,120 --> 01:02:59,640
now how's that for justice?

976
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:01,440
- You need Cates alive too,
he's the only one besides me

977
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:03,440
who could stop the
mailing of the disk.

978
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:09,760
- You give her what she wants.

979
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:15,120
And Walker, bring that
disk to me immediately.

980
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,200
(hollers)

981
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:33,880
- Police, stand
down, stand down!

982
01:03:33,880 --> 01:03:36,120
(punches)

983
01:03:41,560 --> 01:03:44,320
(gun fires)

984
01:03:44,360 --> 01:03:47,160
(dramatic music)

985
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:54,600
(grunts)

986
01:03:57,240 --> 01:03:59,360
- All right, county boy
wanna come to the big city?

987
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:02,680
(punches)

988
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:04,320
(grunts)

989
01:04:04,360 --> 01:04:05,680
(grunts)

990
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:06,680
(punches)

991
01:04:06,680 --> 01:04:08,920
(punches)

992
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:18,400
(dramatic music)

993
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:20,600
(punches)

994
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:40,840
(hollers)

995
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:05,320
(dramatic music)

996
01:05:05,320 --> 01:05:06,240
- Spacious.

997
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:10,000
- Detective, are you all right?

998
01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:10,920
- Yeah.

999
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:14,680
Hey thanks.

1000
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,400
Sorry I called you Goober.
- No problem.

1001
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:22,080
(dramatic music)

1002
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:24,320
- What the hell happened?

1003
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:25,720
- Get out of my seat fed.

1004
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:26,680
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
- Come on, come on.

1005
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:27,880
- I'm 50-years-old, easy, geeze!

1006
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:30,480
(engine revs)

1007
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:36,840
- He sounded scared,
for the first time since

1008
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:41,920
I've been with Sloan, he
actually sounded scared.

1009
01:05:43,040 --> 01:05:46,240
You must have some nasty
stuff on that disk.

1010
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:47,760
- The feds are gonna use it.

1011
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:51,400
- No I'm gonna use it to
get out from under Sloan,

1012
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:54,400
then I'm gonna
blow you up honey.

1013
01:06:00,840 --> 01:06:03,440
(phone rings)

1014
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:04,480
- Sheriff's Office.

1015
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:06,840
It's for you, detective.

1016
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:09,800
- Cates here.
- Jimmy, you made it.

1017
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:11,240
It's me old buddy.

1018
01:06:11,240 --> 01:06:13,440
I've got somebody here
wants to talk to you.

1019
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:17,600
- Jim, they wanna
make a trade, Jim.

1020
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:20,080
The disk for me.
- The disk.

1021
01:06:20,120 --> 01:06:22,440
- You know where it is, it
nearly hit you on the head

1022
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:23,200
when we first met.

1023
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:28,120
- Be at the airport in
an hour, come alone.

1024
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:32,040
If you're not there by 5
p.m., I blow the bitch up.

1025
01:06:32,040 --> 01:06:33,960
- Look, you son of
a bitch you touch-

1026
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:40,320
Well, she's alive.
- What do they want?

1027
01:06:40,360 --> 01:06:43,200
- A trade, the disk for Megan.

1028
01:06:43,240 --> 01:06:44,160
- What disk?

1029
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:46,880
- She said I knew where it was.

1030
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:51,080
Hit me over the head.

1031
01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:53,720
Look I gotta go alone
or they'll kill her.

1032
01:06:53,720 --> 01:06:55,080
- What do you want us to do?

1033
01:06:55,080 --> 01:06:56,880
- Come up with a
brilliant plan to save her

1034
01:06:56,880 --> 01:06:58,320
before I get to the airport.

1035
01:06:58,320 --> 01:07:01,080
- No problem.

1036
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:03,960
(dramatic music)

1037
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:10,840
- Bye, honey, it's been
fun, now don't move.

1038
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:14,520
(dramatic music)

1039
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:19,560
- [Charlie] I've got somebody
here wants to talk to you.

1040
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:22,000
- You hear that?
- What?

1041
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:23,200
- [Megan] Jim.

1042
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:28,040
- Old buddy, I got somebody
here wants to talk to you.

1043
01:07:28,040 --> 01:07:31,400
That boom, that's the sound
of rail cars connecting.

1044
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:32,640
- I don't get it.

1045
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:34,280
- There's only one
place in this county

1046
01:07:34,280 --> 01:07:36,160
where rail cars connect,
railyard depot downtown.

1047
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:38,720
Come on.
- Oh.

1048
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:41,520
(dramatic music)

1049
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:49,440
- Good going Megan.

1050
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:52,240
(dramatic music)

1051
01:07:58,760 --> 01:08:00,880
(grunts)

1052
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:04,360
(punches)

1053
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:08,960
(grunts)

1054
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:12,760
(grunts)

1055
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:18,000
(grunts)
(hollers)

1056
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:21,520
My god!
(grunts)

1057
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:26,560
(punches)
(grunts)

1058
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:30,360
- I'm done playing Cates, get
up 'cause you're gonna die!

1059
01:08:30,360 --> 01:08:34,080
Come on, come on Cates,
get up, you die now!

1060
01:08:36,240 --> 01:08:38,600
(gun fires)

1061
01:08:48,480 --> 01:08:51,200
- Your technique needs work.

1062
01:08:53,360 --> 01:08:56,240
(climactic music)

1063
01:09:15,240 --> 01:09:18,040
(dramatic music)

1064
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:42,640
- No, stay there, no.

1065
01:09:45,880 --> 01:09:49,600
- I see it, stay calm.

1066
01:09:50,760 --> 01:09:52,320
What can you tell
me about the bomb?

1067
01:09:52,320 --> 01:09:55,320
- It has a radio detonator
and if I move it goes off.

1068
01:09:55,320 --> 01:09:57,200
- Okay.
- Be careful.

1069
01:10:02,280 --> 01:10:05,920
- There's a motion sensor
attached and a radio receiver.

1070
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:12,400
You know how to disarm a bomb?

1071
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:13,920
- I'll call the bomb
squad in Burlington.

1072
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:16,000
- We don't have time.

1073
01:10:16,040 --> 01:10:18,240
Call Cates and
tell him to stall.

1074
01:10:18,240 --> 01:10:21,880
But not here, your phone
could set this off.

1075
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:24,720
(dramatic music)

1076
01:10:26,040 --> 01:10:28,880
(phone rings)

1077
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:30,560
- Cates.

1078
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:32,440
- Yeah, we found Megan,
she's at the rail yard.

1079
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:34,920
Delay Walker as
long as possible.

1080
01:10:34,920 --> 01:10:36,600
- Yeah, I hear you
what's the problem?

1081
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:37,680
- [Bob] There's a
bomb attached to her,

1082
01:10:37,720 --> 01:10:39,240
Walker has the detonator.

1083
01:10:39,240 --> 01:10:40,760
- Well get her out of there.

1084
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:42,520
- Well, we're working on it
but there's a motion sensor

1085
01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:43,320
attached to her.

1086
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:45,080
- Oh wonderful.

1087
01:10:45,080 --> 01:10:47,600
- Delay Walker as
long as possible.

1088
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:51,120
- Look, tell Megan I'll
do everything I can.

1089
01:10:56,920 --> 01:10:58,080
- What else do you need?

1090
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:01,360
- A Boy Scout,
some kind of knife?

1091
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:03,480
- Yeah, yeah, got one.

1092
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:04,400
- Give it here.

1093
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:08,560
- You do know what you're
doing don't you deputy?

1094
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:13,200
- I have this cousin,
slept with his vet's wife,

1095
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:15,760
found himself in
the same situation.

1096
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:16,960
Never could figure out

1097
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,560
how a veterinarian got
so many explosives.

1098
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:20,560
- That's not funny.

1099
01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:23,840
- Good, 'cause if you
laugh, we're toast.

1100
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:26,680
(dramatic music)

1101
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:44,520
Okay, what we have here
is a motion tumbler.

1102
01:11:44,520 --> 01:11:46,720
Set there and make the
pinball machine go tilt,

1103
01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:49,120
if you so much as
sneeze, we're all dead.

1104
01:11:53,960 --> 01:11:56,320
- What's the story?
- We're still working on it.

1105
01:11:56,320 --> 01:11:57,680
- Well he's here.

1106
01:11:57,720 --> 01:12:01,240
As soon as I give him
the disk, she's dead.

1107
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:02,160
- Stall him!

1108
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:06,640
- Stall him.

1109
01:12:10,520 --> 01:12:12,040
- What I'm gonna do
is cut this wire,

1110
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:15,800
disarm the blasting
cap and short the coil,

1111
01:12:15,800 --> 01:12:17,920
so I can remove the tumbler.

1112
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:19,360
I need you to hold the wire.

1113
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:22,960
- Great to see you again Jimmy.

1114
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:26,080
- You know, you were the
last person in the world

1115
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:28,240
I thought would sell me out.

1116
01:12:28,280 --> 01:12:29,160
I trusted you.

1117
01:12:30,360 --> 01:12:33,280
You let me believe you
were dead all this time,

1118
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:35,360
my partner, my friend.

1119
01:12:36,440 --> 01:12:39,720
- Gee, Jimmy, I
think I'm gonna cry.

1120
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:41,720
- Why'd you do it, Charles?

1121
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:44,200
- Why does anybody do anything
Jimmy, the obvious reasons.

1122
01:12:44,240 --> 01:12:48,360
Let me give you a few, number
one, I'm dripping with money.

1123
01:12:48,360 --> 01:12:50,040
Number two the babes.

1124
01:12:50,040 --> 01:12:52,240
- What about Reece?
- What about Reece?

1125
01:12:52,280 --> 01:12:54,800
(dramatic music)

1126
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:57,800
- Wait, drain the static
from your body by touching

1127
01:12:57,800 --> 01:12:59,200
that floorboard.

1128
01:12:59,200 --> 01:13:00,480
- Ah geeze, is there
anything else I should know?

1129
01:13:00,520 --> 01:13:03,320
- Stop wearing so
much polyester.

1130
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:05,880
- We grew up together, I
was your kid's godfather

1131
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:09,120
before he died, doesn't
that mean anything to you?

1132
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:10,880
What about the dealings
with your wife?

1133
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:12,440
Doesn't all the-

1134
01:13:12,440 --> 01:13:14,240
- Jimmy, we didn't talk this
much when we were partners.

1135
01:13:14,240 --> 01:13:15,440
If I didn't know any
better, I'd think

1136
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:17,800
you were trying to stall me.

1137
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:19,320
- I see you're still
pretty clever, Charles.

1138
01:13:19,320 --> 01:13:22,200
- The disk, Cates now.

1139
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:31,640
- Megan, you're gonna
have to stop shaking

1140
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:32,960
so I can cut this.

1141
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:34,520
- I'm trying.

1142
01:13:34,520 --> 01:13:36,440
- Gosh, Charles, it was
here just a minute ago.

1143
01:13:36,440 --> 01:13:41,480
- I'm gonna give you to
five, one, two, three, four-

1144
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:44,760
- Oh here it is.

1145
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:47,400
- Surprise, surprise.

1146
01:13:47,400 --> 01:13:50,200
(dramatic music)

1147
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:09,120
Very nice, she's right, this
would have put Sloan away

1148
01:14:09,160 --> 01:14:11,680
and three years
of misery for you.

1149
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:14,680
- Let her go, Charles!

1150
01:14:14,680 --> 01:14:16,000
- After I'm out of here.

1151
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,040
Good to see you again,
Jimmy, take care.

1152
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:27,560
- Is she clear?
- Not yet.

1153
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:29,040
- Well, he's got that disk,

1154
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:30,880
he can hit the detonator
anytime, get her out of there!

1155
01:14:30,920 --> 01:14:32,320
- They are not clear.

1156
01:14:46,200 --> 01:14:48,320
(grunts)

1157
01:14:54,160 --> 01:14:56,280
(grunts)

1158
01:14:57,160 --> 01:14:59,880
(dramatic music)

1159
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:03,640
(grunts)

1160
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:10,920
(grunts)

1161
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,040
(sighs)

1162
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:35,960
(grunts)

1163
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:40,840
(hollers)

1164
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:57,000
(laughs)

1165
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:13,080
(explodes)

1166
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:20,760
(grunts)

1167
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:22,920
(grunts)

1168
01:16:42,440 --> 01:16:44,760
- Take me to the rail yard.

1169
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:49,080
(helicopter whirls)

1170
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:07,680
(dramatic music)

1171
01:17:11,560 --> 01:17:14,040
Oh Megan, I'm so
happy to see you.

1172
01:17:14,040 --> 01:17:17,080
- Excuse me, excuse me, we have
a little matter to resolve,

1173
01:17:17,080 --> 01:17:19,240
it's about the diamonds,

1174
01:17:19,280 --> 01:17:21,600
and my car which
is now scrap metal

1175
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:22,640
and worth absolutely nothing.

1176
01:17:22,680 --> 01:17:24,240
- Let me help.

1177
01:17:24,240 --> 01:17:25,040
- And this Walker affair,
you didn't tell me about-

1178
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:26,320
- Let me help you.

1179
01:17:26,320 --> 01:17:28,520
- The diamonds are
on the helicopter.

1180
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:33,240
- Good to see you, now get out
of town, both of you, quick.

1181
01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:38,320
- A deal's a deal.

1182
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:41,000
- You have the disk then?
- No.

1183
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:42,440
- Shit.
- But you're free.

1184
01:17:44,360 --> 01:17:45,840
- Cates I'm never gonna
be free until Sloan

1185
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:47,760
is gone for good.

1186
01:17:47,800 --> 01:17:50,640
- You can't spend the rest of
your life looking for revenge,

1187
01:17:50,680 --> 01:17:52,320
you'll never have piece of mind.

1188
01:17:53,400 --> 01:17:56,360
(slow music)

1189
01:17:56,400 --> 01:17:57,280
- You're right.

1190
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:01,680
Thank you.

1191
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:16,240
I have to go, I
have to be alone.

1192
01:18:17,080 --> 01:18:19,040
- Alone, alone where?

1193
01:18:19,080 --> 01:18:20,840
- I just need time for myself.

1194
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:24,000
Don't follow me, I'll see you.

1195
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:25,160
- Megan, Megan!

1196
01:18:27,560 --> 01:18:30,360
(dramatic music)

1197
01:18:33,120 --> 01:18:36,080
(police sirens wail)

1198
01:18:36,080 --> 01:18:38,520
(slow music)

1199
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:57,600
Time for yourself,
time for what?

1200
01:19:22,600 --> 01:19:24,080
Time for revenge.

1201
01:19:35,880 --> 01:19:38,680
(dramatic music)

1202
01:19:45,680 --> 01:19:48,120
- Morning Sherman.
- Ah Megan.

1203
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:54,120
I can't say that I didn't expect
to see you sooner or later.

1204
01:19:55,360 --> 01:19:56,560
What do you want?

1205
01:19:56,560 --> 01:19:58,640
- We've got some
unfinished business.

1206
01:19:58,680 --> 01:19:59,720
Oh I don't think so,

1207
01:20:01,160 --> 01:20:02,760
I heard nobody's seems to
be able to find this disk

1208
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:04,320
you've been talking about.

1209
01:20:04,320 --> 01:20:07,000
- Yes, that's right,
I've got no proof left.

1210
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:08,960
Absolutely nothing.

1211
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:10,720
I just wanted to see
the look in your eyes

1212
01:20:10,720 --> 01:20:13,880
when I blow them through
the back of your head.

1213
01:20:15,080 --> 01:20:15,880
- You haven't got the guts.

1214
01:20:15,880 --> 01:20:17,440
- Oh really?

1215
01:20:17,480 --> 01:20:18,960
- Don't do it Megan.

1216
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:21,480
- Detective Cates, this woman
just broke into my office-

1217
01:20:21,480 --> 01:20:22,360
- Shut up.

1218
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:25,080
He isn't worth it, Megan.

1219
01:20:25,120 --> 01:20:26,480
- Leave me alone Jim.

1220
01:20:26,480 --> 01:20:28,560
- You pull that trigger,
you lose any chance

1221
01:20:28,600 --> 01:20:30,040
of getting your life back.

1222
01:20:30,080 --> 01:20:32,360
- One life for so many seems
like a really good deal

1223
01:20:32,360 --> 01:20:33,800
right now.

1224
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:35,240
- You don't need to do this,
we'll get him eventually,

1225
01:20:35,240 --> 01:20:36,120
I promise.

1226
01:20:39,560 --> 01:20:40,520
Put it down, Megan.

1227
01:20:45,680 --> 01:20:48,520
- You're right,
he's not worth it.

1228
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:51,280
- Goddamnit arrest her!

1229
01:20:51,280 --> 01:20:53,680
That crazy bitch is
going to jail for this.

1230
01:20:53,680 --> 01:20:54,560
- Who are you talking about?

1231
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:56,040
- Megan Marlow.

1232
01:20:56,040 --> 01:20:58,320
- No, you must be
mistaken, Megan Marlow died

1233
01:20:58,320 --> 01:21:00,720
in an automobile
explosion some time ago.

1234
01:21:00,720 --> 01:21:02,280
- What?

1235
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:08,120
- I can't touch you now,
Sloan but you're dirty

1236
01:21:08,120 --> 01:21:11,800
and I'm a patient man.

1237
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:15,040
- Get out of here.

1238
01:21:16,360 --> 01:21:19,160
(dramatic music)

1239
01:21:29,120 --> 01:21:30,280
- Jim, come on.

1240
01:21:35,200 --> 01:21:36,720
- Can I have my gun back please.

1241
01:21:36,760 --> 01:21:38,360
- Huh?
- My gun.

1242
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:42,280
- Oh yeah, thanks.

1243
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:45,280
- I don't suppose
it occurred to you

1244
01:21:45,280 --> 01:21:47,480
that if you would have
shot Sloan with my gun,

1245
01:21:47,480 --> 01:21:49,640
it might have been just
a little sticky for me.

1246
01:21:49,640 --> 01:21:53,840
- Oops, I wasn't-
- Oops, oops.

1247
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:57,280
- What are you
gonna do arrest me?

1248
01:21:57,280 --> 01:22:00,400
- No, but you're gonna
help me get Sloan legally.

1249
01:22:01,320 --> 01:22:03,720
- Do you have a plan?
- No

1250
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:06,480
but I'll come up with something.

1251
01:22:06,480 --> 01:22:08,200
- Well I tell you what,
why don't we just put Sloan

1252
01:22:08,240 --> 01:22:09,280
out of our minds
for a little while

1253
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:12,800
and go have some dinner.
- Dinner.

1254
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:16,200
- Yes, dinner, you, me a
nice restaurant, dinner.

1255
01:22:17,160 --> 01:22:19,400
- There it is again.
- What?

1256
01:22:19,400 --> 01:22:20,840
- That tone in your voice.

1257
01:22:20,840 --> 01:22:22,200
- What tone?
- That tone.

1258
01:22:22,200 --> 01:22:24,240
The same tone you had
just before you made me

1259
01:22:24,240 --> 01:22:26,240
jump out of the plane, just
before you stole my gun.

1260
01:22:26,280 --> 01:22:27,680
- Just before I kissed you.

1261
01:22:28,720 --> 01:22:31,520
- Yeah, you know Megan,

1262
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:33,840
I really wanna trust
you but I can't.

1263
01:22:33,880 --> 01:22:35,560
- I don't blame you.

1264
01:22:42,600 --> 01:22:44,360
- Now what am I supposed to do?

1265
01:22:44,360 --> 01:22:45,800
- Enjoy the ride.

1266
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:51,960
- I know a great little
Chinese restaurant.

1267
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,760
(dramatic music)

1268
01:23:02,160 --> 01:23:05,400
- Hello, Jeffrey,
Sloan here how are you?

1269
01:23:05,400 --> 01:23:10,440
Yes, well look it, I have
a bit of a job for you.

1270
01:23:13,720 --> 01:23:15,520
Well it's the wife of
a former friend of mine

1271
01:23:15,560 --> 01:23:19,880
who's been a thorn in my
side for quite some time.

1272
01:23:21,880 --> 01:23:24,040
I'd like to see her take
a rather long vacation

1273
01:23:24,040 --> 01:23:25,320
if you get what I mean.

1274
01:23:27,800 --> 01:23:31,480
No, I'll take care
of it, no problem.

1275
01:23:33,400 --> 01:23:36,320
I'm counting on you
Jeff, don't let me down.
