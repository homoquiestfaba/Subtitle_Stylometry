00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,780
Aw, come on!

3
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:23,250
John just go around him.

4
00:07:25,338 --> 00:07:27,450
I'll try, he's
all over the place.

5
00:08:11,063 --> 00:08:13,210
Jeez you have to be fucking kidding me!

6
00:08:20,618 --> 00:08:21,451
Come on.

7
00:08:30,784 --> 00:08:35,784
He's picking up speed!

8
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:50,403
Oh my God.

9
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:54,453
What?

10
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:56,380
Look I'm sorry, I didn't mean to.

11
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,810
He let us pass.

12
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:34,180
John he's getting really close.

13
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:35,790
Yeah I see him.

14
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:37,640
Maybe he'll just go around.

15
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,250
Shit, never mind.

16
00:10:40,485 --> 00:10:41,808
What does he want?

17
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:43,950
- What do we do?
- I don't know.

18
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:46,210
- John!
- Yeah I see him.

19
00:11:11,046 --> 00:11:11,879
Oh what the fuck is going on?

20
00:11:14,943 --> 00:11:17,261
Fuck!

21
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,020
All right we learned our lesson!

22
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:25,920
John just pull over.

23
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:29,150
Asshole!

24
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:44,360
Come on you bitch,
the road's wide open.

25
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:47,270
Maybe I can make him hit this car.

26
00:12:37,535 --> 00:12:40,085
Seriously John,
we have to pull over now.

27
00:12:44,412 --> 00:12:46,308
All right, all right.

28
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:49,300
So unless anyone else has anything to say,

29
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:53,436
or any suggestions, then
I'm gonna pull over.

30
00:12:58,127 --> 00:12:58,960
What?

31
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:02,460
I really hope
this is a good idea.

32
00:13:21,573 --> 00:13:23,238
Someone needs
to get out and apologize.

33
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,778
- For what?
- I don't know,

34
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:26,668
clearly we pissed him off!

35
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:27,546
I'll take care of this.

36
00:13:27,548 --> 00:13:28,988
No, you've already done plenty

37
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:30,758
but somebody does need to apologize!

38
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:31,658
- Alright fine I'll go.
- No, no, no,

39
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:33,838
wait, wait, wait, I think
we should send a girl.

40
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,778
- What?
- Excuse me?

41
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:37,038
Well I mean it's probably a guy driving

42
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,488
so if we send one of you girls

43
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:39,878
and you act sexy when you apologize...

44
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,350
I am not going,

45
00:13:41,439 --> 00:13:42,808
- forget it!
- I'll go.

46
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:44,960
- What, no!
- No baby I'll be fine.

47
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:48,370
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

48
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:11,740
Excuse me!

49
00:14:12,443 --> 00:14:14,000
Can I talk to you for a minute?

50
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:26,680
Look I'm sorry if we pissed you off!

51
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:31,300
- What did she say?
- Shh, just shut up!

52
00:14:40,202 --> 00:14:41,202
Look just,

53
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:43,780
just please leave us alone,

54
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:47,270
we didn't mean you any harm or disrespect!

55
00:14:52,201 --> 00:14:55,077
Man pulled over.

56
00:14:55,079 --> 00:14:56,496
What's she doing?

57
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:00,448
- What is she doing?
- Well I think she

58
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:03,800
pulled over to tell us that
he wasn't going to follow us!

59
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:11,320
Rachel, come back over here!

60
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:18,540
Dude you need to get your girl!

61
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:23,448
Oh no no, wait wait
wait, get back in man!

62
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:24,878
I don't think he wants you
getting out of the car!

63
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,130
No shit Mike,
but she could be hurt!

64
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:36,226
Look if I can just talk
to you for a minute...

65
00:15:40,428 --> 00:15:41,345
Rachel...

66
00:16:13,399 --> 00:16:15,732
- Oh my god!
- Dude no no no!

67
00:16:16,194 --> 00:16:17,038
- What?
- Dude you need to

68
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,318
wait wait wait!

69
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,151
Out of the car man!

70
00:16:20,153 --> 00:16:21,880
I know that Mike,
but she could be hurt!

71
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:30,211
- You okay?
- Yeah I'm fine,

72
00:16:30,213 --> 00:16:31,044
I'm fine, I'm fine!

73
00:16:31,046 --> 00:16:31,877
That's it we're getting out of here.

74
00:16:31,879 --> 00:16:33,388
No man you can't try and outrun him

75
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:35,040
he'll just knock us off the road!

76
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,580
No shit Mike!

77
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:38,718
What do you suggest?

78
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,210
I don't know, I mean, we
can try and out wait him!

79
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:43,920
Any other suggestions?

80
00:16:44,655 --> 00:16:48,484
No, apologize!

81
00:16:56,661 --> 00:16:58,738
I say we make a run
for it and meet up on the

82
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:00,090
other side of the clearing.

83
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:03,430
Uh, no, I say we play it safe.

84
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:05,928
If we walk in this heat
we'll just get dehydrated.

85
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:08,630
- How much water do we have?
- We don't have any water!

86
00:17:11,062 --> 00:17:13,895
All right, so we'll wait it out.

87
00:18:12,852 --> 00:18:13,685
John!

88
00:20:29,049 --> 00:20:33,216
Help me!

89
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,820
What are we gonna do?

90
00:22:22,433 --> 00:22:23,266
I don't know.

91
00:22:26,065 --> 00:22:27,148
I don't know.

92
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:56,590
Fuck...

93
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,610
Jack, people are trying to sleep.

94
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,960
Yeah yeah yeah, whatever Jenn.

95
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:08,620
Since when are you a mechanic?

96
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:10,550
Since you started being a bitch.

97
00:24:11,985 --> 00:24:13,354
- Hey what the...
- What the hell is,

98
00:24:13,356 --> 00:24:15,515
- Mother fucker!
- is that?

99
00:24:33,083 --> 00:24:34,500
Oh fuck!

100
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:42,290
Where's Jack?

101
00:24:43,636 --> 00:24:44,469
What?

102
00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:54,683
Rachel?

103
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:56,770
What is it?

104
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:57,760
Jack...

105
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:02,733
Jack?

106
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:06,543
Jack?

107
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:08,690
Jack wake up!

108
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:12,190
Jack wake up!

109
00:25:13,809 --> 00:25:14,726
Hey Jack...

110
00:25:19,101 --> 00:25:19,934
Rachel!

111
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:23,038
- Rachel.
- Jack went to fix the

112
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:25,660
car and, he was under the car

113
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:26,908
and then we got hit by the car,

114
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:28,622
Jack was under the car when we got hit!

115
00:25:30,452 --> 00:25:31,285
Jack...

116
00:25:33,389 --> 00:25:34,222
Jack...

117
00:25:34,782 --> 00:25:36,865
Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack...

118
00:25:43,385 --> 00:25:44,218
Jack...

119
00:27:01,342 --> 00:27:04,170
I say we follow these
crosses, head up this path.

120
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:10,283
Why?

121
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:13,760
Because there's bound to be people or...

122
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:16,420
Obviously someone's been here Mike!

123
00:27:18,890 --> 00:27:21,850
Come on dude it looks like
this shit's been here for ages.

124
00:27:22,936 --> 00:27:25,210
Okay, Mike
what do you want to do?

125
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:28,000
You want to keep walking
along the highway?

126
00:27:32,953 --> 00:27:34,720
No, I don't know, all right?

127
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,330
I just don't want to keep walking, I'm...

128
00:27:42,401 --> 00:27:46,050
I say we go down this
road, I don't care anymore.

129
00:27:56,323 --> 00:27:59,478
Well what's with all
the upside-down crosses?

130
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,390
Mike, what do they mean?

131
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:03,900
You don't want
to know, okay, believe me.

132
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:28,628
- Give me a minute.
- You okay?

133
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:30,187
Yeah I just need to catch my breath.

134
00:28:30,189 --> 00:28:31,522
- Sure?
- Yeah...

135
00:28:43,859 --> 00:28:44,692
John...

136
00:29:05,208 --> 00:29:06,518
- They're everywhere!
- That's, I'm sure

137
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,140
there's an explanation, okay?

138
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:10,018
No no John we need to

139
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:10,851
- go back!
- Sh!

140
00:29:10,853 --> 00:29:11,686
Listen to me.

141
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:13,790
I'm sure there's an explanation,

142
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:17,320
try not to think about it, okay?

143
00:29:18,010 --> 00:29:18,843
Go on.

144
00:30:31,085 --> 00:30:32,252
How you doing?

145
00:30:39,450 --> 00:30:41,490
Hi, how you doing?

146
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:47,290
We uh, we got a little lost.

147
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:50,730
And uh, our car broke down.

148
00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:55,740
We were wondering if we
could use your, phone.

149
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,660
Do you have a phone we could use?

150
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:04,343
Sir?

151
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:14,840
Um, I don't know if you know this,

152
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:18,690
but there's um, well I mean it looks like,

153
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:21,750
there's bags of bones
down the way a little.

154
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:27,523
So?

155
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:32,420
Well it's not exactly the
proper burial procedure.

156
00:31:35,930 --> 00:31:38,740
Well, you know whose bones they are?

157
00:31:44,109 --> 00:31:44,942
No...

158
00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:49,350
Then don't worry about it.

159
00:32:06,992 --> 00:32:09,142
Look do you have a
phone we can use here?

160
00:32:12,652 --> 00:32:14,630
Do you have a phone that we can use?

161
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:18,130
Depends on how you ask.

162
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,380
And who asks.

163
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:27,400
Okay, do you have a phone
that we can use, please?

164
00:32:31,670 --> 00:32:34,210
Dude, look, our friend was killed, okay?

165
00:32:34,290 --> 00:32:36,540
There's a killer out
there and he's after us!

166
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:42,560
Kids, always so dramatic
about the smallest of things.

167
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:45,118
Look man our friend is dead okay?

168
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:48,080
He was murdered, literally
like 20 miles from here!

169
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:49,440
We just need your help!

170
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:54,580
Well if he's dead already,
why do you need the phone?

171
00:32:56,450 --> 00:32:58,550
I reckon you can't help him much now.

172
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:02,500
Look, can we use your phone or not?

173
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:05,353
No.

174
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:09,450
Why the fuck not?

175
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:12,070
'Cause I said no,
that's why the fuck not!

176
00:33:12,072 --> 00:33:14,858
Okay, okay,

177
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:16,410
okay, we have money,

178
00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:17,347
- Yeah!
- we can pay you.

179
00:33:17,349 --> 00:33:20,044
Yeah look, we'll pay
you whatever you want!

180
00:33:20,046 --> 00:33:21,730
- Look...
- So the sweet thing

181
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:23,252
talks now does it?

182
00:33:23,254 --> 00:33:26,758
Look, all right...

183
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,838
Okay...

184
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:29,673
Okay.

185
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:32,240
Dude don't...

186
00:33:32,682 --> 00:33:33,768
pay him money!

187
00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:36,910
All right, I got $40, okay?

188
00:33:37,370 --> 00:33:40,450
$40 to make a 30 second phone call.

189
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:41,830
You lying to me boy?

190
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:44,688
- What?
- You heard me you

191
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:45,660
piece of shit!

192
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:48,850
There ain't nobody who can
call nobody for 30 seconds!

193
00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:50,720
Hell you can't even dial that fast!

194
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:52,030
Okay how much?

195
00:33:52,654 --> 00:33:54,401
- Guys!
- I'm not paying

196
00:33:54,403 --> 00:33:56,377
him any money man this is stupid!

197
00:33:56,379 --> 00:33:57,892
- Okay, guys...
- I'm not

198
00:33:57,894 --> 00:34:00,318
- paying him any money!
- Shut up Mike.

199
00:34:07,566 --> 00:34:08,483
Okay, um,

200
00:34:08,959 --> 00:34:11,640
- Jesus Christ...
- all right, we got,

201
00:34:13,241 --> 00:34:18,241
okay, $100, okay, $100 to make one call!

202
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:32,640
Look around son, you see
anything I could spend $100 on?

203
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:37,378
- Stupid little shits!
- Then what do you want?

204
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:38,213
What I want,

205
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:44,380
is that sweet young thing
to bend over for me!

206
00:34:45,463 --> 00:34:47,350
Oh I bet she's really tight!

207
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:52,828
I can smell from here in this
heat, if you know what I mean?

208
00:34:52,830 --> 00:34:54,410
- Fuck you man!
- Stop!

209
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:02,700
You faster than a speeding bullet son?

210
00:35:11,779 --> 00:35:12,612
Oh...

211
00:35:13,490 --> 00:35:14,670
They be watching.

212
00:35:16,850 --> 00:35:18,370
So you best be leaving now.

213
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:25,580
Oh you don't think it's loaded?

214
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,988
Hey you come back when that fine young ass

215
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:36,940
needs a man with experience!

216
00:35:38,805 --> 00:35:40,960
- What?
- Fuck you asshole!

217
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:43,220
I got something for you right now!

218
00:35:44,107 --> 00:35:45,690
Whoo, come on baby!

219
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:09,090
What are, what are we
gonna tell Jack's parents?

220
00:36:09,930 --> 00:36:11,880
We need to tell 'em something you know.

221
00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:15,860
Ignoring me isn't going to shut me up!

222
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:19,448
Maybe this is all our fault for getting

223
00:36:19,450 --> 00:36:21,030
ourselves into this situation.

224
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:24,390
Maybe it's karma, I don't really know,

225
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:26,758
but I knew we should
have never left the car

226
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,548
in the first place, and now Jack

227
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:30,150
is just sitting there rotting!

228
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,580
What the hell are we doing?

229
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:34,658
We have no fucking idea where we are,

230
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:36,668
there's no roads anywhere and nobody

231
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:39,580
can agree on one direction to go!

232
00:36:39,650 --> 00:36:40,518
And we're all gonna just

233
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,508
- end up like Jack!
- All right shut

234
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:44,100
the fuck up, okay, seriously!

235
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:45,778
What you think any of us are happy that

236
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:48,208
we're stuck out here in
the, the ass end of nowhere,

237
00:36:48,210 --> 00:36:49,740
butt-fucking Egypt?

238
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:53,030
Look we're all starving, we're all tired!

239
00:36:53,970 --> 00:36:56,808
I mean seriously, you just got
to pull your shit together,

240
00:36:56,810 --> 00:36:58,698
'cause you're starting to fucking lose it!

241
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:01,720
And this whole blame game it's
really not doing anything!

242
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:04,860
What are you trying to say Mike?

243
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:08,780
That none of us are
happy that Jack's dead!

244
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:11,228
Okay, and now is not the
time to talk about it,

245
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:13,000
I mean it's just making shit worse!

246
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:17,910
You know what Mike?

247
00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:20,578
If this is the way that
you show compassion

248
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:23,030
in a relationship, then fuck you!

249
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:24,870
I don't need this!

250
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:30,280
What, you're just gonna walk off?

251
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,460
Seriously, what are you doing?

252
00:37:33,809 --> 00:37:35,498
What the hell are you doing Tiffany?

253
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,688
Tiffany where the hell do
you think you're going?

254
00:37:37,690 --> 00:37:39,268
Look you're not seriously
pulling this shit!

255
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:40,118
What are you doing?

256
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:42,220
Don't throw them, you better not fucking...

257
00:37:42,463 --> 00:37:44,013
What the hell's wrong with you?

258
00:37:45,310 --> 00:37:46,180
Real mature Tiff!

259
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,240
Okay I got the body.

260
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:32,073
Jacob!

261
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,140
Jacob, let's go!

262
00:38:38,226 --> 00:38:39,326
Who the fuck are they?

263
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:42,080
They're gonna want a ride.

264
00:38:52,531 --> 00:38:54,260
- Gimme your arm!
- Why?

265
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:56,188
- Just give it to me!
- Whoa whoa whoa whoa,

266
00:38:56,190 --> 00:38:57,140
what are you doing?

267
00:38:57,630 --> 00:38:58,978
But pop said no more playing with the

268
00:38:58,980 --> 00:38:59,811
- bodies!
- Yeah yeah yeah,

269
00:38:59,813 --> 00:39:01,108
I know what he said,
and I also know you were

270
00:39:01,110 --> 00:39:02,260
feeling those girls up!

271
00:39:05,425 --> 00:39:06,975
All right, so now listen to me!

272
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:09,528
I know pop's did you wrong and I know his

273
00:39:09,530 --> 00:39:11,268
beatings have made you a little slow,

274
00:39:11,270 --> 00:39:12,798
but so help me you fuck this up and

275
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,050
I will beat you into
next week, you got that?

276
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:17,413
Yes ma'am.

277
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:20,690
Are you getting this?

278
00:39:23,410 --> 00:39:24,243
Yeah.

279
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:29,608
Now just let me do all
the talking, all right,

280
00:39:29,610 --> 00:39:30,610
and just play along.

281
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:36,110
Everything's gonna be all right.

282
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:38,250
I love you, you know that.

283
00:39:41,729 --> 00:39:44,010
So just wave when I point to you, okay?

284
00:39:56,879 --> 00:39:58,708
- Hi!
- How's it going?

285
00:39:58,710 --> 00:40:00,658
Uh, we had some car
trouble down the road

286
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:02,368
a little bit and we were wondering,

287
00:40:02,370 --> 00:40:03,668
- maybe...
- It looks like you,

288
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:05,070
having a bit of car trouble.

289
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:09,110
Yeah well, damn thing
overheats and all you know.

290
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,348
Well no, I'm pretty good with cars,

291
00:40:13,350 --> 00:40:15,910
I mean, maybe I could help you out?

292
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:19,490
Yeah um, you know
what don't worry about it,

293
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:21,760
you know it's cooled down, we'll be okay.

294
00:40:24,950 --> 00:40:27,350
Looks like you guys had
a little bit of trouble.

295
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:29,420
Yeah, that's one way to put it.

296
00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:37,360
Well, um,
since your car is working,

297
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:41,430
I was wondering, maybe
you could give us a ride,

298
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:43,660
uh, to the nearest gas station?

299
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:46,738
Uh, yeah you know I would but um,

300
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:48,998
we don't really have any
room in the car right now.

301
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,440
- Um...
- Are you serious?

302
00:40:53,290 --> 00:40:55,278
Lady do you have any idea how long we've

303
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,690
been walking on these roads?

304
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,638
I don't know the last
time we had any food,

305
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:01,150
or water, we've been out here for hours!

306
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:03,790
All right, look,

307
00:41:05,634 --> 00:41:08,640
look, maybe you could just give

308
00:41:09,110 --> 00:41:10,490
one of us, a ride?

309
00:41:11,124 --> 00:41:12,374
Just to the nearest town?

310
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:15,270
Okay like I was trying to tell you,

311
00:41:15,290 --> 00:41:17,188
I would but we had a
little more car trouble,

312
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:19,230
we also had a flat tire and my friend,

313
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:21,978
hurt his hand so I gotta get him over

314
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:23,100
to the emergency room.

315
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:25,658
What I can do is come back for you guys

316
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:27,720
maybe in like 20 minutes, okay?

317
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:31,650
Yeah, yeah sure.

318
00:41:48,910 --> 00:41:49,743
Um, look,

319
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:56,300
my girlfriend's a pre-med, okay?

320
00:41:56,770 --> 00:41:59,730
So maybe she could help out your friend,

321
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:01,500
and you could help us out?

322
00:42:06,788 --> 00:42:07,621
What?

323
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:10,740
What is your fucking problem, huh?

324
00:42:12,310 --> 00:42:13,738
What, I'm just trying to help!

325
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:15,418
No, you know what, I don't even know

326
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:16,251
what you're trying to do,

327
00:42:16,253 --> 00:42:17,408
I'm trying to help you out here

328
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:18,870
but you just keep pushing me!

329
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:21,268
Lady I'm trying to make the best of

330
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:22,288
- the situation!
- No you, you know what?

331
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:24,028
I am this close to leaving your asses and

332
00:42:24,030 --> 00:42:25,698
your shitty attitudes
out here in the middle

333
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:28,090
of the fucking forest, how
would you like that huh?

334
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:36,940
But I'm gonna be the better person here,

335
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:38,910
and forget we even talked about this.

336
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:43,480
So Like I said, I can come
back for you in 20 minutes.

337
00:42:43,750 --> 00:42:44,810
Take it or leave it!

338
00:42:59,730 --> 00:43:01,058
Productive chat there buddy.

339
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:02,210
Dude, shut up.

340
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:18,080
They buy it, you fool 'em?

341
00:43:18,374 --> 00:43:19,207
I don't know.

342
00:43:20,850 --> 00:43:24,180
Fuck, I should just run the
little shits over right now!

343
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:26,393
Yeah.

344
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:29,848
Shit I can't.

345
00:43:29,850 --> 00:43:32,248
The little fuckers'll
splatter all over the road

346
00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:34,610
and I don't want to get stuck
cleaning 'em up all night.

347
00:43:34,830 --> 00:43:35,810
We'll come back.

348
00:43:38,806 --> 00:43:41,540
What if, what if somebody
else comes by and picks 'em up?

349
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:44,473
Fuck!

350
00:43:45,108 --> 00:43:46,300
I didn't mean to upset you,

351
00:43:46,302 --> 00:43:47,133
- I didn't...
- You know just

352
00:43:47,135 --> 00:43:47,968
shut up for a minute!

353
00:43:59,968 --> 00:44:00,801
Hey.

354
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:04,008
Hey listen, I'm sorry about back there,

355
00:44:04,010 --> 00:44:05,198
I don't know what happened to me,

356
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:06,728
I'm just worried about my
friend, I got to get him

357
00:44:06,730 --> 00:44:08,868
to the hospital but,
you know it's not really

358
00:44:08,870 --> 00:44:11,018
safe for you guys out here, it's uh,

359
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:12,898
there's no lights, and there's a lot of

360
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:14,850
drunk drivers in this neighborhood, so,

361
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:17,580
if you guys go down the road a ways,

362
00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:20,168
there's a path, take it, it'll go to this

363
00:44:20,170 --> 00:44:23,158
old cabin, it's abandoned,
it's not much but

364
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:25,328
it'll be safe and warm and I'll
come pick you guys up there.

365
00:44:25,330 --> 00:44:27,018
- Okay.
- All right?

366
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:28,860
Thanks, I appreciate it.

367
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:32,738
- You guys hungry?
- Yeah, we haven't eaten,

368
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:34,268
in god knows how long.

369
00:44:34,270 --> 00:44:36,110
- Gimme that.
- It's mine!

370
00:44:36,595 --> 00:44:38,845
I'll get you another one!

371
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:42,638
- Here.
- Thanks.

372
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:44,090
- Please hurry.
- Okay.

373
00:44:44,544 --> 00:44:45,377
Thanks.

374
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:44,250
Feels like something's watching us.

375
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:48,540
What are you talking about?

376
00:46:50,190 --> 00:46:51,390
I don't know.

377
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:56,060
Something's not right.

378
00:47:01,531 --> 00:47:03,981
did anyone hear
a car go by last night?

379
00:47:04,266 --> 00:47:05,800
No...

380
00:47:09,891 --> 00:47:10,724
Okay.

381
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:14,900
Well I say we head to the
abandoned house anyway.

382
00:47:15,310 --> 00:47:16,210
Wait out the heat.

383
00:47:17,525 --> 00:47:19,224
If that bitch doesn't show up...

384
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:23,200
Keep walking along the highway at night.

385
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:26,313
I agree.

386
00:48:10,957 --> 00:48:12,657
Jenn what are you doing, let's go!

387
00:48:18,180 --> 00:48:19,530
I think I hear something.

388
00:48:24,647 --> 00:48:27,610
No I'm serious, I think it's a cell phone!

389
00:48:28,730 --> 00:48:30,668
I'm not gonna run around
the woods looking for

390
00:48:30,670 --> 00:48:33,490
the secret cell phone
stash of the forest elves!

391
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:35,950
- I'm not gonna do it Jenn!
- Fucking bitch...

392
00:48:37,220 --> 00:48:38,120
We'll wait here.

393
00:49:10,590 --> 00:49:11,550
Jenn let's go!

394
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:13,133
Shh!

395
00:49:43,324 --> 00:49:45,120
- Asshole!
- What did I scare you?

396
00:49:46,660 --> 00:49:48,208
Seriously, that's not funny!

397
00:49:48,210 --> 00:49:49,478
- Okay...
- Back off!

398
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:52,270
- Well we need to get...
- Back the fuck off!

399
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:54,940
You need to chill out.

400
00:49:55,777 --> 00:49:57,991
Okay, you know what, just-

401
00:50:44,070 --> 00:50:45,028
I'm gonna wait for them,

402
00:50:45,030 --> 00:50:46,788
I'm not gonna jut keep going without them!

403
00:50:46,790 --> 00:50:48,140
Somebody's coming around,

404
00:50:48,580 --> 00:50:49,413
there he is.

405
00:50:49,790 --> 00:50:51,260
You guys, time to go!

406
00:50:51,881 --> 00:50:53,531
- Jesus Christ!
- What the hell?

407
00:50:53,811 --> 00:50:55,258
I don't know but he's
running from something.

408
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:56,392
- Mike!
- Let's go!

409
00:50:56,394 --> 00:50:57,287
- Mike!
- Where the fuck

410
00:50:57,289 --> 00:50:58,456
are you going?

411
00:51:17,030 --> 00:51:18,388
- Oh my god...
- You guys there's

412
00:51:18,390 --> 00:51:21,878
something out there, there's
something back there!

413
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:23,380
What about Jenn?

414
00:51:23,630 --> 00:51:24,780
I mean she still alive?

415
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:26,328
No idea...

416
00:51:26,330 --> 00:51:29,870
We need to block all the
doors, and block the windows.

417
00:51:30,330 --> 00:51:31,710
Rachel, come here!

418
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:35,990
Help me block these windows.

419
00:51:37,611 --> 00:51:39,948
- You okay?
- No Mike, I'm so fucking

420
00:51:39,950 --> 00:51:40,866
- far from okay right now...
- All right all right

421
00:51:40,868 --> 00:51:42,968
all right all right, calm down, calm down!

422
00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:45,620
Look, it's gonna be all right, okay?

423
00:51:45,622 --> 00:51:46,455
Come here.

424
00:51:48,668 --> 00:51:50,835
You'll be okay, all right?

425
00:51:51,350 --> 00:51:52,448
Let's just get the windows right now,

426
00:51:52,450 --> 00:51:53,978
we're gonna get out of here, okay?

427
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:54,900
Go help out!

428
00:52:02,166 --> 00:52:03,833
- Mike, Mike!
- Fuck!

429
00:52:06,826 --> 00:52:07,659
What?

430
00:52:09,611 --> 00:52:13,353
Shit!

431
00:52:15,359 --> 00:52:17,240
- The floor is hollow.
- So what?

432
00:52:17,242 --> 00:52:18,733
It means we could get
underneath the house!

433
00:52:18,735 --> 00:52:20,285
What, dude...

434
00:52:20,287 --> 00:52:21,783
Here...

435
00:52:21,785 --> 00:52:22,840
Around the back let's go!

436
00:52:22,842 --> 00:52:24,259
- Oh!
- Shit, hey!

437
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:31,510
When I say go, pull it forward!

438
00:52:31,512 --> 00:52:32,345
Ready, go!

439
00:52:35,591 --> 00:52:36,424
Yeah!

440
00:52:36,893 --> 00:52:39,405
What now, huh mother fucker?

441
00:52:39,407 --> 00:52:41,990
Yeah you fucking piece of shit!

442
00:52:49,537 --> 00:52:50,454
Uh, guys!

443
00:52:52,895 --> 00:52:54,645
We're not alone here!

444
00:52:59,328 --> 00:53:00,495
Fuck!

445
00:53:12,069 --> 00:53:13,236
Hey, get back!

446
00:53:14,123 --> 00:53:16,268
Get back!

447
00:53:16,270 --> 00:53:17,808
- Mike stop!
- Fuck off!

448
00:53:17,810 --> 00:53:20,200
He's chained
up Mike just back off!

449
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:23,910
- John...
- Mike!

450
00:53:24,060 --> 00:53:25,310
I know I know, I heard!

451
00:53:26,230 --> 00:53:29,188
No no no no no, it's safer
in the house, it's safer.

452
00:53:29,190 --> 00:53:30,858
You know, guys, let's just try to

453
00:53:30,860 --> 00:53:32,210
get out over here, come on.

454
00:53:41,131 --> 00:53:43,910
Oh fuck, babe, you okay?

455
00:53:44,665 --> 00:53:45,818
- Babe...
- Shit!

456
00:53:45,820 --> 00:53:46,720
- Oh shit!
- Hey!

457
00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:49,208
- Come on!
- Dude let go!

458
00:53:49,210 --> 00:53:50,238
- Mike!
- Let go man!

459
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:51,381
Come on Mike, get up!

460
00:53:51,383 --> 00:53:52,216
Go, go go!

461
00:56:24,776 --> 00:56:25,609
Shit!

462
00:56:38,717 --> 00:56:41,414
Go ahead, fucking kill
me you piece of shit!

463
00:58:30,250 --> 00:58:31,083
No!

464
00:58:32,038 --> 00:58:34,288
No!

465
00:58:42,459 --> 00:58:43,292
Fuck you!

466
00:58:45,149 --> 00:58:45,982
No!

467
00:58:47,756 --> 00:58:49,915
Take off your fucking mask!

468
00:58:52,437 --> 00:58:53,270
No!

469
00:58:56,235 --> 00:58:57,066
Fuck you!

470
00:58:57,068 --> 00:58:59,587
No!

471
01:03:06,819 --> 01:03:09,902
It-it, it's its good, good for you!

472
01:03:11,016 --> 01:03:16,016
You'll never run away!

473
01:04:30,770 --> 01:04:31,603
Please!

474
01:04:32,122 --> 01:04:34,205
Please, please let me go!

475
01:04:37,798 --> 01:04:38,631
Please!

476
01:05:12,007 --> 01:05:14,048
Pretty
girl, pretty blood...

477
01:05:37,822 --> 01:05:39,072
No!

478
01:05:39,950 --> 01:05:40,783
No!

479
01:05:44,998 --> 01:05:45,831
No!

480
01:06:39,703 --> 01:06:41,203
Okay what do you want to do?

481
01:06:41,560 --> 01:06:43,720
Okay, now's our chance.

482
01:06:44,310 --> 01:06:46,570
We need to run in there, grab Tiffany,

483
01:06:46,650 --> 01:06:47,770
run out the side door.

484
01:06:48,703 --> 01:06:49,536
Okay.

485
01:07:10,810 --> 01:07:12,130
That's Tiffany's shirt.

486
01:07:13,560 --> 01:07:17,138
Don't look at it, don't look at it.

487
01:07:17,140 --> 01:07:20,158
Just keep a look out,
see if anybody's coming.

488
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:23,330
I'll try to find some
keys, drive out of...

489
01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:27,420
- John.
- Oh shit, yeah.

490
01:08:01,410 --> 01:08:02,650
What do you want to do?

491
01:08:02,983 --> 01:08:06,610
Okay, okay, we're gonna hide, all right,

492
01:08:06,630 --> 01:08:09,130
I'm gonna try to get her keys, okay?

493
01:08:10,542 --> 01:08:11,875
You up for this?

494
01:08:12,380 --> 01:08:13,547
Yeah, come on.

495
01:08:14,569 --> 01:08:17,069
Come on let's hide, over here.

496
01:09:01,146 --> 01:09:03,063
Oh boy!

497
01:09:42,240 --> 01:09:43,380
Are you kidding me?

498
01:09:48,010 --> 01:09:49,680
Are you fucking kidding me?

499
01:09:50,040 --> 01:09:51,808
I don't want to go through
this with you again!

500
01:09:51,810 --> 01:09:53,850
Take off that fucking mask right now!

501
01:10:00,539 --> 01:10:03,249
Now!

502
01:10:09,898 --> 01:10:14,281
Now!

503
01:11:15,530 --> 01:11:16,363
What?

504
01:11:17,909 --> 01:11:20,400
Okay, now what, you're gonna start?

505
01:11:20,670 --> 01:11:22,195
Go, go Rachel, front door, go!

506
01:11:22,197 --> 01:11:23,780
I'll take them, go!

507
01:11:30,064 --> 01:11:32,376
Rachel, go!

508
01:11:32,378 --> 01:11:34,158
Go!

509
01:13:50,920 --> 01:13:52,720
I trust you had a nice little nap.

510
01:13:54,584 --> 01:13:57,578
I know, I know, I know,
judging by your reaction

511
01:13:57,580 --> 01:14:00,130
you're a little bit worried
that we might hurt you.

512
01:14:02,160 --> 01:14:04,210
Honestly, we probably will.

513
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:06,890
Sh, sh, sh!

514
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:15,230
It's okay, it's okay, if you'd
just calm down a little bit.

515
01:14:15,232 --> 01:14:17,740
Really, I mean,

516
01:14:20,120 --> 01:14:22,520
what do you think, you
think I'm beautiful, huh?

517
01:14:26,050 --> 01:14:26,883
It's okay.

518
01:14:28,572 --> 01:14:31,100
You can tell me, I don't mind.

519
01:14:31,973 --> 01:14:33,929
Where shall we start

520
01:14:38,627 --> 01:14:41,477
Shut the fuck up asshole, I'm
have a fucking moment here!

521
01:14:46,330 --> 01:14:49,230
I know, I know, I have a little
bit of a temper.

522
01:14:49,620 --> 01:14:51,298
But I'm working on it I really am!

523
01:14:51,300 --> 01:14:53,600
And I think it helps that
I'm pretty don't you?

524
01:14:55,621 --> 01:14:58,590
But I have to admit I'm getting
a little annoyed because uh,

525
01:14:59,003 --> 01:15:01,300
you know I'm not really as
pretty as you are though.

526
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:04,273
But then again,

527
01:15:05,220 --> 01:15:06,720
all the pretty ones die young.

528
01:15:13,430 --> 01:15:15,338
You guys think it's fair that this cunt

529
01:15:15,340 --> 01:15:17,660
is better looking than me, hmm?

530
01:15:24,680 --> 01:15:27,380
What do you think we
should do about it, huh?

531
01:15:27,943 --> 01:15:31,066
What, what, huh, what?

532
01:15:31,068 --> 01:15:31,901
Okay...

533
01:15:47,723 --> 01:15:49,670
You want to try that again, hmm?

534
01:15:54,553 --> 01:15:55,680
Does this hurt, huh?

535
01:15:59,199 --> 01:16:00,999
I know what'll make you feel better.

536
01:16:03,080 --> 01:16:06,600
And because I like you so much,
I'm gonna use my own stuff.

537
01:16:26,430 --> 01:16:28,130
Seriously, what's with the crying?

538
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:30,368
I mean I know you're upset and all but

539
01:16:30,370 --> 01:16:32,440
I'm playing this so you'll calm down!

540
01:16:42,227 --> 01:16:43,777
Let's see what we have in here.

541
01:16:48,170 --> 01:16:50,550
What do you guys think
of Rachel's face, huh?

542
01:16:57,684 --> 01:16:59,540
I think she looks kind of slutty.

543
01:17:01,779 --> 01:17:03,147
I mean are you a slut?

544
01:17:04,501 --> 01:17:08,630
I mean, I know you probably
went out with a lot of boys.

545
01:17:09,020 --> 01:17:11,690
Which means you probably
slept with a lot of 'em.

546
01:17:13,252 --> 01:17:15,550
You can tell me, I don't mind.

547
01:17:20,348 --> 01:17:22,055
You know what darling?

548
01:17:22,057 --> 01:17:24,010
You really got to relax!

549
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:29,470
All going to be, okay.

550
01:17:33,984 --> 01:17:36,578
You really, you
better learn to relax,

551
01:17:36,580 --> 01:17:39,880
you're starting to put
me a little bit on edge!

552
01:17:42,512 --> 01:17:44,612
Mmm, 'cause I don't want you to.

553
01:17:56,871 --> 01:17:58,494
Rachel, Rachel!

554
01:17:58,496 --> 01:18:00,486
Rachel!

555
01:18:00,488 --> 01:18:01,738
Rachel, Rachel!

556
01:18:03,472 --> 01:18:06,798
Rachel, listen to me,
listen to me, listen to me!

557
01:18:18,731 --> 01:18:21,064
Rachel listen to me, listen!

558
01:18:22,369 --> 01:18:24,952
Rachel, Rachel, Rachel, Rachel!

559
01:18:28,704 --> 01:18:30,371
Go to the car, okay?

560
01:18:31,147 --> 01:18:32,566
Here's the keys, here's the keys!

561
01:18:32,568 --> 01:18:34,595
You should go to the car and, start it up,

562
01:18:34,597 --> 01:18:35,512
I'll be right there!

563
01:18:35,514 --> 01:18:38,931
Sh, hey!

564
01:18:41,712 --> 01:18:42,545
Okay.

565
01:18:43,716 --> 01:18:47,299
Start the car, okay,
I'll be right there.

566
01:18:57,357 --> 01:19:00,400
All right,
put the chainsaw down!

567
01:19:00,570 --> 01:19:02,457
It's all a big misunderstanding!

568
01:19:02,459 --> 01:19:03,831
- What, what the...
- Go ahead and ask Rachel,

569
01:19:03,833 --> 01:19:05,584
we're like best friends now!

570
01:19:05,586 --> 01:19:08,358
What the fuck is wrong
with you people, huh?

571
01:19:08,360 --> 01:19:11,377
All of you have some
serious fucking issues!

572
01:19:11,379 --> 01:19:12,257
You know what?

573
01:19:12,259 --> 01:19:14,050
- Back off!
- Calm down, put the chainsaw

574
01:19:14,052 --> 01:19:17,885
down, we'll talk like
normal, rational adults!

575
01:19:58,750 --> 01:19:59,583
Let me drive.

576
01:20:05,170 --> 01:20:06,003
Let me drive.

577
01:20:19,571 --> 01:20:20,404
You okay?

578
01:20:23,987 --> 01:20:25,287
Oh shit!

579
01:20:44,763 --> 01:20:47,158
Oh shit, it's okay!

580
01:20:47,160 --> 01:20:50,800
It's okay, don't worry, look,
look I have a plan, okay?

581
01:20:52,450 --> 01:20:54,558
Look, we have to make a stand, all right,

582
01:20:54,560 --> 01:20:55,860
we can't out-run him.

583
01:20:56,420 --> 01:20:57,600
Okay if we...

584
01:20:58,570 --> 01:21:00,130
We're safer outside the car,

585
01:21:00,340 --> 01:21:01,358
more than we are inside the car.

586
01:21:01,360 --> 01:21:02,868
If we head down the road he's just gonna

587
01:21:02,870 --> 01:21:03,720
run us off again!

588
01:21:04,830 --> 01:21:06,420
We might not be so lucky this time.

589
01:21:06,454 --> 01:21:08,504
Sh, it's okay, it's okay!

590
01:21:10,951 --> 01:21:12,118
I have a plan.

591
01:21:14,055 --> 01:21:14,888
Okay?

592
01:21:15,770 --> 01:21:16,603
Do you trust me?

593
01:21:23,233 --> 01:21:24,316
Okay, okay...

594
01:21:26,940 --> 01:21:27,773
Jack off!

595
01:21:29,280 --> 01:21:31,350
She's yours, huh!

596
01:21:31,710 --> 01:21:32,800
She's dead too!

597
01:21:34,239 --> 01:21:35,150
Are you happy?

598
01:21:35,880 --> 01:21:38,570
Huh, are you fucking happy?

599
01:21:39,630 --> 01:21:42,710
You took everyone, you took
everything away from me!

600
01:21:53,818 --> 01:21:56,568
I have nothing to fight you with.

601
01:23:18,990 --> 01:23:20,573
Fuck you asshole!

602
01:23:27,471 --> 01:23:28,388
Let's go!

603
01:23:41,673 --> 01:23:43,860
We're gonna need a lot of therapy.

604
01:26:39,765 --> 01:26:44,765
