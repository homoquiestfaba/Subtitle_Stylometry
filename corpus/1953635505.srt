Man's voice:
<i>SOLVING THE FOLLOWING RIDDLE</i>

3
00:00:20,287 --> 00:00:22,788
<i>WILL REVEAL THE AWFUL SECRET</i>
<i>BEHIND THE UNIVERSE,</i>

4
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:25,224
<i>ASSUMING YOU DO NOT GO</i>
<i>UTTERLY MAD IN THE ATTEMPT.</i>

5
00:00:25,226 --> 00:00:28,394
<i>SAY YOU HAVE AN AX-- JUST A</i>
<i>CHEAP ONE FROM HOME DEPOT.</i>

6
00:00:28,396 --> 00:00:31,030
- (chopping)
- <i>ON ONE BITTER WINTER DAY</i>

7
00:00:31,032 --> 00:00:32,798
- <i>YOU USE SAID AX TO BEHEAD A MAN.</i>
<i>- (grunting)</i>

8
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,367
<i>DON'T WORRY--</i>
<i>THE MAN'S ALREADY DEAD.</i>

9
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:38,370
<i>MAYBE YOU SHOULD WORRY,</i>
<i>'CAUSE YOU'RE THE ONE WHO SHOT HIM.</i>

10
00:00:38,372 --> 00:00:40,239
<i>HE'D BEEN</i>
<i>A BIG TWITCHY GUY</i>

11
00:00:40,241 --> 00:00:43,142
<i>WITH VEINED SKIN</i>
<i>STRETCHED OVER SWOLLEN BICEPS,</i>

12
00:00:43,144 --> 00:00:44,643
<i>TATTOO OF A SWASTIKA</i>
<i>ON HIS TONGUE.</i>

13
00:00:44,645 --> 00:00:46,445
<i>AND YOU'RE CHOPPING OFF</i>
<i>HIS HEAD BECAUSE</i>

14
00:00:46,447 --> 00:00:48,514
<i>EVEN WITH EIGHT</i>
<i>BULLET HOLES IN HIM,</i>

15
00:00:48,516 --> 00:00:50,482
<i>YOU'RE PRETTY SURE HE'S ABOUT</i>
<i>TO SPRING BACK TO HIS FEET</i>

16
00:00:50,484 --> 00:00:52,718
<i>AND EAT THE LOOK OF TERROR</i>
<i>RIGHT OFF YOUR FACE.</i>

17
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,120
<i>YOU NOW HAVE A BROKEN AX.</i>

18
00:00:55,122 --> 00:00:58,490
- <i>SO YOU GO TO THE HARDWARE STORE...</i>
<i>- (bell jingles)</i>

19
00:00:58,492 --> 00:01:03,228
<i>...EXPLAINING AWAY THE DARK REDDISH</i>
<i>STAINS ON THE HANDLE AS BARBEQUE SAUCE.</i>

20
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:06,498
- (rain pattering) - <i>THE REPAIRED AX
SITS UNDISTURBED IN YOUR HOUSE</i>

21
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:10,102
- <i>UNTIL THE NEXT SPRING WHEN
ONE RAINY MORNING... - (chittering)</i>

22
00:01:10,104 --> 00:01:14,106
<i>SO YOU GRAB YOUR TRUSTY AX AND</i>
<i>CHOP THE THING INTO SEVERAL PIECES.</i>

23
00:01:14,108 --> 00:01:16,341
- (clangs)
- <i>ON THE LAST BLOW, HOWEVER...</i>

24
00:01:16,343 --> 00:01:19,445
<i>OF COURSE A CHIPPED HEAD MEANS YET</i>
<i>ANOTHER TRIP TO THE HARDWARE STORE.</i>

25
00:01:22,282 --> 00:01:25,384
<i>AS SOON AS YOU GET HOME WITH</i>
<i>YOUR NEWLY-HEADED AX THOUGH...</i>

26
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,521
(groaning)

27
00:01:29,523 --> 00:01:32,424
<i>YOU MEET THE REANIMATED BODY OF</i>
<i>THE GUY YOU BEHEADED LAST YEAR,</i>

28
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:35,594
<i>ONLY HE'S GOT A NEW HEAD</i>
<i>STITCHED ON WITH WHAT LOOKS LIKE</i>

29
00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:38,797
<i>PLASTIC WEED-TRIMMER LINE AND</i>
<i>WEARS THAT UNIQUE EXPRESSION</i>

30
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,266
<i>OF YOU'RE-THE-MAN-WHO-KILLED-</i>
<i>ME-LAST-WINTER RESENTMENT</i>

31
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:43,335
<i>THAT ONE SO RARELY ENCOUNTERS</i>
<i>IN EVERYDAY LIFE.</i>

32
00:01:43,337 --> 00:01:45,170
<i>SO YOU BRANDISH YOUR AX.</i>

33
00:01:45,172 --> 00:01:49,274
(raspy)
THAT'S THE AX THAT SLAYED ME.

34
00:01:51,177 --> 00:01:52,778
Man's voice:
<i>IS HE RIGHT?</i>

35
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:55,314
<i>(dramatic music playing)</i>

36
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:11,530
<i>(crickets chirping)</i>

37
00:02:14,434 --> 00:02:16,602
<i>(distant barking)</i>

38
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:28,514
(squeaking)

39
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:38,323
Man's voice:
<i>MY NAME IS DAVID WONG.</i>

40
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:40,559
<i>I ONCE SAW A MAN'S KIDNEY GROW TENTACLES,</i>

41
00:02:40,561 --> 00:02:42,761
<i>TEAR ITSELF OUT OF A RAGGED HOLE IN HIS BACK</i>

42
00:02:42,763 --> 00:02:44,796
<i>AND GO SLAPPING</i>
<i>ACROSS MY KITCHEN FLOOR.</i>

43
00:02:44,798 --> 00:02:46,932
<i>BUT THAT'S ANOTHER STORY.</i>

44
00:02:46,934 --> 00:02:49,835
(inhales deeply, gasps)

45
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:53,238
<i>MORE SIDE EFFECTS.</i>

46
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,641
<i>IT'S ALWAYS LIKE THIS</i>
<i>WHEN I'M ON THE SAUCE.</i>

47
00:02:55,643 --> 00:02:57,442
- <i>I DOSED SIX HOURS AGO.</i>
<i>- (plate clinks)</i>

48
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:03,215
<i>MY COUNT HAD 5,829 GRAINS</i>
<i>OF RICE ON HER PLATE.</i>

49
00:03:03,217 --> 00:03:05,584
<i>THE RICE WAS GROWN IN ARKANSAS.</i>
<i>THE GUY WHO RAN</i>

50
00:03:05,586 --> 00:03:07,719
<i>THE JOHN DEERE HARVESTER</i>
<i>WAS NICKNAMED COOTER.</i>

51
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:09,621
(squeaking)

52
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:14,426
<i>I'M NOT A GENIUS.</i>
<i>I'M NOT A PSYCHIC EITHER.</i>

53
00:03:14,428 --> 00:03:16,228
<i>JUST SIDE EFFECTS,</i>
<i>THAT'S ALL.</i>

54
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:17,930
<i>(man's voice, distorted)</i>
<i>DAVID WONG?</i>

55
00:03:17,932 --> 00:03:20,332
<i>(normal voice)</i>
<i>DAVID WONG?</i>

56
00:03:20,334 --> 00:03:22,601
WHAT, DID YOU
DOZE OFF THERE?

57
00:03:22,603 --> 00:03:25,971
HEY, YOU'RE--
YOU'RE ARNIE, RIGHT?

58
00:03:25,973 --> 00:03:28,607
ARNIE BLONDESTONE.
SORRY I'M LATE.

59
00:03:28,609 --> 00:03:31,243
YOU DON'T LOOK ASIAN,
MR. WONG.

60
00:03:31,245 --> 00:03:34,846
I'M NOT.
I WAS BORN RIGHT HERE.

61
00:03:34,848 --> 00:03:37,749
HAD MY LAST NAME CHANGED THOUGH.
THOUGHT IT'D MAKE ME HARDER TO FIND.

62
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:40,819
YOU KNOW THAT WONG IS THE MOST
COMMON SURNAME IN THE WORLD?

63
00:03:40,821 --> 00:03:43,589
MMM. IS YOUR FAMILY
STILL AROUND?

64
00:03:43,591 --> 00:03:46,925
NO, I WAS ADOPTED.
I NEVER KNEW MY REAL DAD.

65
00:03:46,927 --> 00:03:49,895
YOU COULD BE MY DAD
FOR ALL I KNOW.

66
00:03:51,364 --> 00:03:52,698
ARE YOU MY DAD?

67
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,833
UH... (chuckles)

68
00:03:54,835 --> 00:03:56,368
I DON'T THINK SO, NO.

69
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:59,271
ANYWAY, MY ADOPTED FAMILY
MOVED AWAY.

70
00:03:59,273 --> 00:04:01,673
I WON'T TELL YOU
WHERE THEY WENT, BUT...

71
00:04:01,675 --> 00:04:04,610
GET OUT YOUR PEN,
'CAUSE YOU'RE GONNA WANNA WRITE THIS DOWN.

72
00:04:04,612 --> 00:04:07,813
<i>MY BIOLOGICAL MOM,</i>
<i>SHE WAS INSTITUTIONALIZED.</i>

73
00:04:07,815 --> 00:04:09,448
MUST'VE BEEN HARD.

74
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:11,783
SHE WAS A STRUNG-OUT,
CRANK-ADDICTED CANNIBAL,

75
00:04:11,785 --> 00:04:14,920
<i>DABBLED IN VAMPIRISM</i>
<i>AND NECROMANCY.</i>

76
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:17,623
BLEW HER WELFARE CHECK
EVERY MONTH ON BLACK CANDLES.

77
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:20,425
REALLY? AND I THOUGHT
MY MOM WAS BAD

78
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:22,928
BECAUSE SHE WOULDN'T
LET ME WATCH "SPACE GHOST."

79
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:27,499
- YOU PULLING MY LEG?
- NO, THIS IS JUST WHAT I DO WHEN I GET NERVOUS.

80
00:04:27,501 --> 00:04:30,569
UM, SHE WAS BIPOLAR,
THAT'S ALL.

81
00:04:30,571 --> 00:04:33,405
<i>COULDN'T KEEP A HOUSE.</i>
<i>BUT ISN'T THE OTHER STORY BETTER THOUGH?</i>

82
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:36,008
- I THINK YOU SHOULD USE THAT.
- I THOUGHT YOU WANTED

83
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:38,610
TO GET THE TRUTH OUT,
YOUR SIDE OF IT.

84
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:41,847
IF NOT, WHAT ARE WE EVEN
DOING HERE, MR. WONG?

85
00:04:41,849 --> 00:04:45,384
YOU'RE RIGHT. SORRY.

86
00:04:45,386 --> 00:04:46,952
SO YOU GUYS ARE--
YOU'RE WHAT?

87
00:04:46,954 --> 00:04:50,289
YOU'RE SOME KIND
OF SPIRITUALISTS?

88
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:52,357
EXORCISTS?
SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

89
00:04:52,359 --> 00:04:55,494
Dave's voice:
<i>I COULD BLOW YOUR WORLD AWAY, ARNIE.</i>

90
00:04:55,496 --> 00:04:57,629
<i>IF I SHOW YOU</i>
<i>WHAT'S IN THIS CONTAINER,</i>

91
00:04:57,631 --> 00:04:59,665
<i>YOU'LL NEVER FEEL AT ONE</i>
<i>WITH THE HUMAN RACE</i>

92
00:04:59,667 --> 00:05:01,366
<i>UNTIL THE DAY YOU DIE.</i>

93
00:05:01,368 --> 00:05:03,635
<i>YOU EVER</i>
<i>SHIT YOURSELF, ARNIE?</i>

94
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:06,872
<i>'CAUSE YOU WOULD'VE IF</i>
<i>YOU'D BEEN THERE LAST NIGHT.</i>

95
00:05:06,874 --> 00:05:09,875
- <i>(cellphone ringing)</i>
<i>- (music playing on TV)</i>

96
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:16,415
Man on TV:
<i>He's a seeker of truth in an age of fear.</i>

97
00:05:16,417 --> 00:05:19,418
- <i>(man #2 whispers) Marconi.</i>
<i>- Man: He is willing to face down</i>

98
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:22,521
- <i>the legions of evil.</i>
<i>- Man #2: Marconi.</i>

99
00:05:22,523 --> 00:05:24,756
Man:
<i>He will help his fellow man</i>

100
00:05:24,758 --> 00:05:27,359
<i>to find a path</i>
<i>into the light.</i>

101
00:05:27,361 --> 00:05:28,760
Man #2: <i>Marconi.</i>

102
00:05:36,803 --> 00:05:38,970
(cellphone rings)

103
00:05:38,972 --> 00:05:40,672
(beeps)

104
00:05:41,941 --> 00:05:44,776
- HELLO?
- <i>Hey, this is John.</i>

105
00:05:44,778 --> 00:05:47,446
<i>Your pimp says bring</i>
<i>the crack shipment tonight</i>

106
00:05:47,448 --> 00:05:48,980
<i>or he'll be forced</i>
<i>to stick you.</i>

107
00:05:48,982 --> 00:05:51,383
<i>Meet him where we buried</i>
<i>the Korean whore--</i>

108
00:05:51,385 --> 00:05:53,385
<i>the one</i>
<i>without the goatee.</i>

109
00:05:53,387 --> 00:05:55,487
David's voice:
<i>THAT WAS JOHN'S CODE.</i>

110
00:05:55,489 --> 00:05:57,489
<i>IT MEANT "BRING YOUR GEAR</i>
<i>AND COME TO MY PLACE</i>

111
00:05:57,491 --> 00:05:59,524
<i>AS SOON AS YOU CAN.</i>
<i>IT'S IMPORTANT."</i>

112
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:01,660
JOHN, IT'S 3:00
IN THE MORNING, MAN.

113
00:06:01,662 --> 00:06:03,462
John:
<i>Oh, and don't forget--</i>

114
00:06:03,464 --> 00:06:05,997
<i>tomorrow's the day</i>
<i>we kill the president.</i>

115
00:06:05,999 --> 00:06:07,733
- JOHN.
- (beeps)

116
00:06:07,735 --> 00:06:09,901
David's voice:
<i>THAT LAST PART WAS CODE</i>

117
00:06:09,903 --> 00:06:13,071
- <i>FOR "STOP AND PICK ME UP SOME
BEER ON THE WAY." - (beeps)</i>

118
00:06:28,855 --> 00:06:31,890
- <i>(crickets chirping)</i>
<i>- (knocking)</i>

119
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:40,766
DAVE. COME IN.

120
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:49,107
DAVE, THIS IS SHELLY.
SHE NEEDS OUR HELP.

121
00:06:51,644 --> 00:06:54,613
SO, SHELLY,
TELL US YOUR STORY.

122
00:06:54,615 --> 00:06:57,482
IT'S MY BOYFRIEND.
HE WON'T LEAVE ME ALONE.

123
00:06:57,484 --> 00:06:59,985
HE'S BEEN HARASSING ME
FOR THE PAST WEEK.

124
00:06:59,987 --> 00:07:02,521
I'M TERRIFIED TO GO HOME.

125
00:07:02,523 --> 00:07:04,423
- MISS...
- MORRIS.

126
00:07:04,425 --> 00:07:06,024
MISS MORRIS,

127
00:07:06,026 --> 00:07:08,059
I'D STRONGLY RECOMMEND
A WOMEN'S SHELTER.

128
00:07:08,061 --> 00:07:09,995
<i>THEY CAN HELP YOU GET</i>

129
00:07:09,997 --> 00:07:12,564
- <i>A RESTRAINING ORDER--</i>
<i>- MY BOYFRIEND...</i>

130
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:16,535
HAS BEEN DEAD
FOR TWO MONTHS.

131
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:24,976
I DIDN'T KNOW
WHERE ELSE TO GO.

132
00:07:24,978 --> 00:07:27,612
I HEARD THROUGH A FRIEND
THAT YOU GUYS HANDLE...

133
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:29,848
UNUSUAL PROBLEMS.

134
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:32,484
SHELLY, WHEN HE COMES,
YOU CAN SEE HIM?

135
00:07:32,486 --> 00:07:34,719
YES, AND I CAN HEAR HIM.

136
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:44,095
- HE HITS YOU?
- MAN, WHAT A DICK!

137
00:07:44,097 --> 00:07:46,231
SHELLY, IN OUR EXPERIENCE,

138
00:07:46,233 --> 00:07:48,667
SPIRITUAL BEINGS THAT
CAN MANIPULATE OBJECTS

139
00:07:48,669 --> 00:07:50,802
IN THE PHYSICAL WORLD
ARE RARE.

140
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:54,206
UH, LOOK, MISS MORRIS,
I REALLY DON'T THINK--

141
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:56,241
I TOLD HER THAT WE'D
LOOK INTO THIS TONIGHT.

142
00:07:56,243 --> 00:07:58,710
I THOUGHT THAT MAYBE
YOU AND I COULD GO OVER THERE

143
00:07:58,712 --> 00:08:00,912
AND SHOW THIS BASTARD
WHAT'S WHAT.

144
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:14,659
John: SO WHERE DO YOU SEE HIM MOSTLY?

145
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:17,095
IN THE BASEMENT.

146
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:24,102
AND ONCE IN THE BATHROOM
WHEN I WAS ON THE TOILET,

147
00:08:24,104 --> 00:08:26,638
- HE STUCK HIS HAND THROUGH THE SEAT ONCE.
- OKAY, JUST--

148
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,240
JUST SHOW US
THE BASEMENT DOOR.

149
00:08:29,742 --> 00:08:31,243
IT'S THAT WAY.

150
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:42,020
(sighs)

151
00:08:48,227 --> 00:08:51,029
- <i>(clicks)</i>
<i>- WELL... (clears throat)</i>

152
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:53,765
- HE'S NOT HERE.
- BIG SURPRISE.

153
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:57,269
SHE SEEMS LIKE
A NICE GIRL, DOESN'T SHE?

154
00:08:57,271 --> 00:08:59,771
<i>SHE REMINDS ME OF AMBER--</i>
<i>AMY'S FRIEND.</i>

155
00:08:59,773 --> 00:09:02,274
WHEN SHE CAME TO MY DOOR TONIGHT I
ACTUALLY THOUGHT IT WAS HER FOR A SECOND.

156
00:09:02,276 --> 00:09:04,876
OH, BY THE WAY, DAVE,
I WANTED TO THANK YOU FOR COMING ALONG.

157
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:07,245
I'M NOT SAYING I'M GONNA TAKE ADVANTAGE
OF HER DISTRESS OR ANYTHING, BUT...

158
00:09:07,247 --> 00:09:10,081
- (clicks)
- David: AW, JEEZ.

328
00:18:54,901 --> 00:18:56,667
DO YOU DREAM, MAN?

329
00:18:56,669 --> 00:18:59,704
I INTERPRET DREAMS...
FOR A BEER.

330
00:18:59,706 --> 00:19:02,540
WELL, I DON'T HAVE ANY BEER,

331
00:19:02,542 --> 00:19:04,775
SO I GUESS I'M OUT OF LUCK.

332
00:19:04,777 --> 00:19:06,911
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I'LL DO,
MR. SKEPTIC MAN.

333
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:11,315
I'LL DO IT LIKE DANIEL
IN THE OLD TESTAMENT.

334
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:13,518
I'LL TELL YOU
THE LAST DREAM THAT YOU HAD

335
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,254
AND THEN I'LL BREAK DOWN
IT'S MEANING FOR YA.

336
00:19:16,256 --> 00:19:19,857
AND IF I'M RIGHT,
YOU OWE ME A BEER. OKAY, MAN?

337
00:19:20,792 --> 00:19:22,760
SURE. (sighs)

338
00:19:22,762 --> 00:19:26,230
I MEAN, YOU'VE OBVIOUSLY BEEN
BLESSED WITH SUPERNATURAL GIFTS.

339
00:19:26,232 --> 00:19:29,667
WHAT BETTER WAY TO USE THEM THAN
TO FISH FOR FREE BEER AT PARTIES?

340
00:19:30,636 --> 00:19:32,436
YOU HAD THIS ONE

341
00:19:32,438 --> 00:19:34,705
<i>EARLY</i> THIS MORNING

342
00:19:34,707 --> 00:19:36,607

OF THE THUNDERSTORM.

343
00:19:36,609 --> 00:19:38,609
AND IN THE DREAM,
YOU WERE BACK

344
00:19:38,611 --> 00:19:40,811
WITH YOUR GIRLFRIEND
TINA.

345
00:19:40,813 --> 00:19:43,614
David's voice:
<i>WHOA. HOW'D HE KNOW THAT?</i>

346
00:19:43,616 --> 00:19:46,317
AND YOU COME HOME
AND SHE'S THERE

347
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:48,286
WITH THIS BIG
HONKING PILE OF DYNAMITE

348
00:19:48,288 --> 00:19:51,322
AND ONE OF THEM
CARTOON PLUNGER DETONATORS,

349
00:19:51,324 --> 00:19:53,291
READY TO BLOW.

350
00:19:53,293 --> 00:19:55,259
AND YOU SAY,
"WHAT YOU DOING?"

351
00:19:55,261 --> 00:19:58,696
(whispers) AND SHE SAYS, "THIS,"
AND BOOM.

352
00:19:58,698 --> 00:20:00,398
YOUR EYES SNAP OPEN

353
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,434
AND THE EXPLOSION
AT THE END OF THE DREAM

354
00:20:03,436 --> 00:20:06,404
BECOME THE CLAP OF THUNDER
OUTSIDE OF YOUR WINDOW.

355
00:20:06,406 --> 00:20:08,439
(chuckles)

356
00:20:08,441 --> 00:20:11,509
SO TELL ME, MAN--
AM I CLOSE?

357
00:20:11,511 --> 00:20:14,278
David's voice:
<i>HOLY SHIT.</i>

358
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,680
OKAY.
(chuckles)

359
00:20:16,782 --> 00:20:19,517
YOU MADE A LUCKY GUESS.

360
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:22,220
YOU SEE?
YOU GOTTA ASK YOURSELF, MAN--

361
00:20:22,222 --> 00:20:27,525
YOU GOTTA BE REALLY BRAVE TO ASK
YOURSELF THE SCARY QUESTIONS.

362
00:20:27,527 --> 00:20:31,395
HOW DID
YOUR MIND KNOW, DAVID,

363
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:33,931
- THAT THE THUNDER WAS COMING?
- HOW'D YOU KNOW MY--

364
00:20:33,933 --> 00:20:37,802
THE THUNDER CAME RIGHT AS SHE HIT THE
DETONATOR AT THE END OF YOUR DREAM.

365
00:20:37,804 --> 00:20:41,706
YOUR MIND STARTED THE DREAM
30 SECONDS BEFORE THE THUNDER.

366
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:44,775
NOW HOW DID THE MIND KNOW
THAT THE THUNDER WAS COMING?

367
00:20:44,777 --> 00:20:47,511
<i>HMM?</i>
<i>(chuckles)</i>

368
00:20:47,513 --> 00:20:48,813
BECAUSE...

369
00:20:49,815 --> 00:20:52,550
TIME IS AN OCEAN...

370
00:20:52,552 --> 00:20:54,518
(whispering)
NOT A GARDEN HOSE.

371
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:57,888
SPACE IS A PUFF OF SMOKE,
A WISP OF CLOUD.

372
00:20:57,890 --> 00:20:59,757
(chuckles)

373
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:04,428
YOUR MIND IS
A FLYING CORN SNAKE,

374
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:08,032
HOVERING THROUGH
ALL THE POSSIBILITIES.

375

WHATEVER.

377

YOU WANT TO KNOW WHERE
YOUR PAPA REALLY WAS

378
00:21:14,941 --> 00:21:17,008
WHEN YOU WERE IN HOSPITAL
WITH BROKE LEG?

379
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:21,812
DO YOU WANT ME TO TELL YOU
THE NAME OF YOUR SOULMATE?

380
00:21:21,814 --> 00:21:24,315

381

<i>(music continues)</i>

382
00:21:26,486 --> 00:21:30,488
DO YOU WANT TO KNOW WHEN THE FIRST
NUCLEAR BOMB WILL HIT AMERICAN SOIL?

383
00:21:31,523 --> 00:21:33,424

- YEAH?
- John: <i>Dave?</i>

490
00:27:14,967 --> 00:27:16,700
<i>It's me.</i>

491
00:27:20,005 --> 00:27:22,740
- IS THIS A RECORDING?
- <i>What? No.</i>

492
00:27:22,742 --> 00:27:25,909
<i>Look, I don't know if we've talked</i>
<i>tonight but we don't have much time.</i>

493
00:27:25,911 --> 00:27:28,979
<i>I think I called you and told you to come here.</i>
<i>If so, don't do it.</i>

494
00:27:28,981 --> 00:27:31,315
<i>If I haven't called,</i>
<i>then obviously you shouldn't--</i>

495
00:27:31,317 --> 00:27:33,817
- <i>just stay away regardless.</i>
<i>- WHO IS THIS?</i>

496
00:27:33,819 --> 00:27:35,719
<i>It's John.</i>
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

497
00:27:35,721 --> 00:27:38,355
(whispering) I CAN HEAR YOU AND I CAN SEE YOU.

498
00:27:38,357 --> 00:27:40,257
YOU'RE SITTING
RIGHT HERE NEXT TO ME.

499
00:27:40,259 --> 00:27:42,359
<i>Well, then just talk</i>
<i>to me in person then.</i>

500
00:27:42,361 --> 00:27:45,362
<i>Oh wait, do I look like</i>
<i>I'm injured in any way?</i>

501
00:27:45,364 --> 00:27:47,765
- WHAT?
- <i>Shh. I'm sorry, I gotta go.</i>

502
00:27:47,767 --> 00:27:49,199
- <i>Say hello to me.</i>
<i>- (beeps)</i>

503
00:27:52,404 --> 00:27:54,071
WAS THAT ME?

504
00:27:56,408 --> 00:27:57,941
IT WAS ME, WASN'T IT?

505
00:28:01,246 --> 00:28:04,915
I'M SORRY, DAVE.
NO, I REALLY AM.

506
00:28:04,917 --> 00:28:07,885
I'M SORRY FOR MESSING UP
YOUR SLEEP CYCLE.

507
00:28:07,887 --> 00:28:11,355
- COME ON, GET IN THE CAR. - I'M SORRY
FOR EVERYTHING THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN.

508
00:28:11,357 --> 00:28:14,224
ALL THE PEOPLE
THAT ARE GONNA...

509
00:28:14,226 --> 00:28:17,261
(sighs) EXPLODE.

510
00:28:19,898 --> 00:28:22,232
David:
JOHN. JOHN, WAKE UP.

511
00:28:22,234 --> 00:28:24,034
HE'S STILL BREATHING.

512
00:28:29,107 --> 00:28:31,809
(rattles)

513
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:42,820
FUCK IT.

Man:
<i>Saint Dom's.</i>

517
00:28:56,869 --> 00:28:59,169
UH, HI.
I NEED A PRIEST.

518
00:28:59,171 --> 00:29:02,239
WELL, THIS IS FATHER SHELNUT.
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?

519
00:29:02,241 --> 00:29:03,474
DO YOU...

520
00:29:03,476 --> 00:29:05,843
HAVE ANY EXPERIENCE
WITH, LIKE...

521
00:29:05,845 --> 00:29:07,411
DEMONISM?

522
00:29:07,413 --> 00:29:09,847
<i>Like hauntings,</i>
<i>possessions and all that?</i>

523
00:29:09,849 --> 00:29:12,182
<i>Look, people say</i>
<i>they see things</i>

524
00:29:12,184 --> 00:29:15,953
<i>or hear voices in their head,</i>
<i>we generally refer them to a counselor.</i>

525
00:29:15,955 --> 00:29:18,322
NO NO NO. NO NO.
I'M NOT CRAZY.

526
00:29:18,324 --> 00:29:21,992
- OTHER PEOPLE HAVE--
- <i>No, I didn't mean to imply that.</i>

527
00:29:21,994 --> 00:29:23,927
WHY DON'T YOU
COME TALK TO ME?

528
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:27,197
AND THEN EVEN IF YOU NEED
TO SEE A PROFESSIONAL,

529
00:29:27,199 --> 00:29:29,500
I'VE GOT A BROTHER-IN-LAW
WHO'S REAL GOOD.

530
00:29:29,502 --> 00:29:33,036
- WHAT DO YOU THINK IT'S LIKE, FATHER?
- <i>What's what like?</i>

531
00:29:33,038 --> 00:29:35,439
<i>Being crazy,</i>
<i>mentally ill.</i>

532
00:29:35,441 --> 00:29:38,408
WELL, THEY NEVER KNOW
THEY'RE ILL, DO THEY?

533
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:42,479
<i>I mean, you can't diagnose yourself with</i>
<i>the same organ that has the disease,</i>

534
00:29:42,481 --> 00:29:44,882
JUST LIKE YOU CAN'T SEE
YOUR OWN EYEBALL.

535
00:29:44,884 --> 00:29:46,917
<i>I suppose</i>
<i>you just feel regular</i>

536
00:29:46,919 --> 00:29:49,953
AND THE REST OF THE WORLD
SEEMS TO GO CRAZY AROUND YOU.

537
00:29:49,955 --> 00:29:52,322
BUT LET'S JUST SUPPOSE
THAT I ACTUALLY--

538
00:29:52,324 --> 00:29:55,959
I MEAN, IN REALITY,
RAN INTO SOMETHING FROM BEYOND THE--

539
00:29:55,961 --> 00:29:57,361

AH!

541
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:03,200
AH.

David's voice:

544

<i>Yes, son, I am.</i>

550
00:30:30,196 --> 00:30:32,362
<i>Just keep calm, okay?</i>

551
00:30:32,364 --> 00:30:35,165
<i>Nothing you're seeing</i>

552
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:38,902
David's voice: <i>I COULD FEEL IT,</i>

YOUR TIME, BUT...

555
00:30:43,876 --> 00:30:46,210
I'M STARTING TO THINK THERE'S
NOTHING YOU CAN DO TO HELP ME.

556
00:30:46,212 --> 00:30:48,312
SON, I'M GOING
TO BE HONEST WITH YOU.

557
00:30:48,314 --> 00:30:51,448
<i>We both know</i>

558
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:53,517
EXCUSE ME?

559
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:56,854

<i>Great changes are coming</i>

<i>You'll see it, David.</i>

563
00:31:05,865 --> 00:31:08,165
<i>You'll see it</i>

MY INTEREST IS ONLY IN YOU.

585
00:32:35,154 --> 00:32:38,989
IT IS SAID OUT OF GENUINE
CONCERN FOR YOUR SAFETY.

586
00:32:40,191 --> 00:32:43,360
A VERY IMPORTANT ROLE
YOU MUST PLAY.

587

KORROK IS
A POWERFUL ADVERSARY.

588

589
00:32:54,572 --> 00:32:56,406
- FASCINATING.
- WHAT?

590
00:32:56,408 --> 00:33:00,010
THEY HARVEST INSECTS HERE,
DO THEY NOT? FOR THEIR HONEY?

591
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:04,314
DO THE BEES KNOW THAT
THEY MAKE THE HONEY FOR YOU

592
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:08,618
OR DO THEIR WORK TIRELESSLY BECAUSE
THEY THINK IT IS THEIR OWN CHOICE?

- <i>HAVE YOU EVER NOTICED</i>

00:33:13,158 --> 00:33:17,127
YOU WILL HEAR THAT WORD

596
00:33:17,129 --> 00:33:20,664
DO YOU EVER WONDER
WHY SOMETIMES YOU'LL SEE

I'VE BEEN WATCHING YOU

BUT THERE ARE GREAT GAPS
IN MY KNOWLEDGE.

601
00:33:35,781 --> 00:33:40,684
DO YOU KNOW I OBSERVED A MAN
WHO MASTURBATED UNTIL HE BLED?

602
00:33:40,686 --> 00:33:42,252
DID HE WANT TO DO THAT?

603
00:33:42,254 --> 00:33:44,287

OKAY. OKAY.

THIS THING I GOT POINTED AT
YOU-- YOU KNOW WHAT IT DOES?

611
00:34:13,284 --> 00:34:16,219
I BELIEVE
I HAVE AN IDEA, YES.

612
00:34:16,221 --> 00:34:18,789
AND ARE YOU FAMILIAR
WITH THE OLD HUMAN SAYING

613
00:34:18,791 --> 00:34:21,258
"I WANT TO SHOOT YOU SO BAD,
MY DICK'S HARD"?

614
00:34:22,326 --> 00:34:24,494
I DON'T BELIEVE I DO.

615
00:34:24,496 --> 00:34:26,797
MAYBE YOU'LL HEAR IT AGAIN
IN THE NEXT 24 HOURS

616
00:34:26,799 --> 00:34:28,565
IF YOU DON'T TRY
TO FUCK WITH ME.

617
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:32,803
NOW SHUT UP

WOULD YOU PLEASE STEP OUT OF THE CAR?
YOU AND YOUR FRIEND?

WELL, I WENT

639
00:35:59,925 --> 00:36:02,259
I LEFT AROUND MIDNIGHT.

640
00:36:02,261 --> 00:36:03,927
I WAS ASLEEP BY 2:00.

641
00:36:03,929 --> 00:36:06,229
OOH, YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?

642
00:36:06,231 --> 00:36:08,298
<i>YOU SURE YOU DIDN'T GO OVER</i>

<i>- HAVE YOU HEARD THE NAME</i>

652
00:36:33,825 --> 00:36:36,693
(distorted) NATHAN CURRY?
A GUY ABOUT YOUR AGE.

653
00:36:36,695 --> 00:36:39,663
<i>HIS PARENTS OWN A BODY SHOP</i>
<i>RIGHT HERE IN TOWN.</i>

654
00:36:39,665 --> 00:36:41,965
- NO.
- David's voice: <i>"HOW ABOUT SHELBY WINDER?"</i>

655
00:36:41,967 --> 00:36:44,334
HOW ABOUT SHELBY WINDER?

656
00:36:44,336 --> 00:36:47,637
<i>HEAVY GIRL.</i>
<i>SENIOR AT EAST SIDE HIGH.</i>

657
00:36:47,639 --> 00:36:50,473
- <i>JUSTIN WHITE?</i>
<i>- NO, SORRY.</i>

658
00:36:50,475 --> 00:36:54,344
- WHAT HAPPENED?
- David's voice: <i>EVERYTHING WAS OBVIOUS NOW.</i>

659
00:36:54,346 --> 00:36:56,379
<i>ALL THE WALLS OF THE MAZE</i>
<i>TURNED TO GLASS.</i>

660
00:36:56,381 --> 00:36:58,315
<i>I IMMEDIATELY KNEW</i>
<i>TWO THINGS:</i>

661
00:36:58,317 --> 00:37:00,717
<i>THIS LIST OF PEOPLE HAD ALL</i>
<i>BEEN AT THE PARTY LAST NIGHT</i>

662
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:02,919
<i>AND THEY WERE ALL NOW DEAD</i>
<i>OR HEADING THERE.</i>

663
00:37:02,921 --> 00:37:06,256
<i>HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?</i>
<i>HOW DO YOU KNOW ANY OF THIS?</i>

664
00:37:06,258 --> 00:37:08,792
<i>MAGIC?</i>
<i>YOU KNOW DAMN WELL WHY.</i>

665
00:37:08,794 --> 00:37:11,428
<i>THAT BLACK SHIT JOHN TOOK</i>
<i>MADE BLOOD CONTACT WITH YOU.</i>

666
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:13,697
- (chuckles)
- <i>NOW YOU'RE GETTING HIGH, PARTNER,</i>

667
00:37:13,699 --> 00:37:17,300
<i>ON THE SOY SAUCE.</i>
<i>IT'S GOT YOU.</i>

668
00:37:17,302 --> 00:37:19,936
AT LEAST NINE PEOPLE
AT THE ONE BALL INN

669
00:37:19,938 --> 00:37:22,272
AT CLOSING TIME
12 HOURS AGO...

670
00:37:22,274 --> 00:37:24,808
THREE ARE MISSING.
YOUR FRIEND IS HERE.

671
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:26,977
THE REST ARE DEAD.

672
00:37:26,979 --> 00:37:29,913
<i>YOUR FRIEND IS</i>
<i>THE ONLY KNOWN SURVIVOR</i>

673
00:37:29,915 --> 00:37:31,681
<i>OF THE ONE BALL NINE.</i>

674
00:37:31,683 --> 00:37:34,618
AND NOW DON'T TAKE
OFFENSE AT THIS--

675
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:37,754
BUT HE'S NOT LOOKING
TOO HEALTHY RIGHT ABOUT NOW.

676
00:37:37,756 --> 00:37:39,823
DID HE SAY ANYTHING
THIS MORNING?

677
00:37:39,825 --> 00:37:41,925
JOHN CALLED ME LAST NIGHT,
TALKING CRAZY--

678
00:37:41,927 --> 00:37:45,528
PARANOIA, HALLUCINATIONS,
THE WHOLE MONSTERS-IN- HIS-APARTMENT BIT.

679
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:47,831
SAID HE COULDN'T REMEMBER HOW
HE GOT WHERE HE WAS LIKE THAT.

680
00:37:47,833 --> 00:37:49,966
DID HE SAY WHAT HE WAS ON?

681
00:37:50,901 --> 00:37:52,402
NO.

682
00:37:52,404 --> 00:37:54,337
YOU KNOW WE'LL
FIND OUT ANYWAY, RIGHT?

683
00:37:54,339 --> 00:37:56,039
<i>I'M NOT INTERESTED</i>
<i>IN BOOKING A BUNCH</i>

684
00:37:56,041 --> 00:37:58,308
<i>OF YOUR RAVER BUDDIES</i>
<i>FOR POPPING PILLS.</i>

685
00:37:58,310 --> 00:38:01,344
TO SOMEBODY LIKE ME,
DEAD BODIES ARE WHAT MATTERS.

686
00:38:01,346 --> 00:38:04,347
NOW IF SOMEBODY IS OUT THERE
SELLING POISON--

687
00:38:04,349 --> 00:38:06,349
I WOULD TELL YOU IF I KNEW.

688
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:11,554
SO WHAT, THAT'S HOW
EVERYONE DIED?

689
00:38:11,556 --> 00:38:13,323
OVERDOSE?

690
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:18,662
WHAT ABOUT THAT GUY?
YOU KNOW HIM?

691
00:38:18,664 --> 00:38:20,430
<i>YEAH, HE WAS THERE.</i>
<i>(taps)</i>

692
00:38:20,432 --> 00:38:22,866
WHATEVER JOHN HAD,
HE GOT IT FROM THIS GUY.

693
00:38:22,868 --> 00:38:25,969
THAT'S BRUCE MATTHEWS.
HE RUNS AN AMATEUR

694
00:38:25,971 --> 00:38:28,405
UNLICENSED
PHARMACEUTICAL OPERATION

695
00:38:28,407 --> 00:38:30,974
ON THE CORNER
OF 30th AND LEXINGTON.

696
00:38:30,976 --> 00:38:32,642
AND THOSE?

697
00:38:32,644 --> 00:38:33,843
BEFORE.

698
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:36,546
AFTER.

699
00:38:42,053 --> 00:38:44,521
WHAT COULD EVEN
DO THAT TO A PERSON?

700
00:38:44,523 --> 00:38:46,690
LIKE A BOMB
OR SOME KIND OF--

701
00:38:46,692 --> 00:38:49,326
NOTHING YOU'D KNOW HOW TO DO.
I'M SURE OF THAT.

702
00:38:49,328 --> 00:38:53,029
MAYBE IT'S SOMETHING NOT WITHIN
THE BOUNDS OF OUR FAMILIARITY.

703
00:38:53,031 --> 00:38:54,964
WHAT I--

704
00:38:54,966 --> 00:38:57,400
(whispers) SIR,
WE NEED YOU IN THE OTHER ROOM NOW.

705
00:39:02,406 --> 00:39:04,607
HEY, WHAT THE HELL'S
GOING ON?

706
00:39:04,609 --> 00:39:06,509
GOD DAMN IT.

707
00:39:06,511 --> 00:39:09,412
(chattering)

708
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:18,488
YOUR FRIEND...

709
00:39:19,724 --> 00:39:21,791
- HE'S DEAD.
- <i>(tape record clicks)</i>

710
00:39:21,793 --> 00:39:23,893
SORRY. HOLD ON.

711
00:39:23,895 --> 00:39:25,895
SO, UH...

712
00:39:25,897 --> 00:39:29,065
BLACK STUFF--
THIS SOY SAUCE.

713
00:39:29,067 --> 00:39:31,067
THAT'S A DRUG, RIGHT?

714
00:39:31,069 --> 00:39:33,837
- OH, I'LL GET TO THAT.
- IT MAKES YOU SMARTER WHEN YOU TAKE IT.

715
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:35,772
IT LETS YOU READ MINDS
AND ALL THAT.

716
00:39:35,774 --> 00:39:39,676
IT HEIGHTENS YOUR SENSES,
I THINK.

717
00:39:39,678 --> 00:39:43,546
I DON'T KNOW. IT'S LIKE-- WHEN YOU'RE ON IT,
IT'S LIKE OVERLOAD.

718
00:39:43,548 --> 00:39:45,548
<i>LIKE IF YOU HOOKED</i>
<i>YOUR CAR RADIO UP</i>

719
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:47,984
TO ONE OF THOSE INTERPLANETARY
S.E.T.I. ANTENNAS,

720
00:39:47,986 --> 00:39:50,553
YOU JUST GET SHIT
FROM ALL OVER THE PLACE.

721
00:39:50,555 --> 00:39:53,490
YOU CAN SEE THINGS
YOU SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO.

722
00:39:53,492 --> 00:39:55,125
AND YOU'VE STILL GOT
SOME OF THIS STUFF?

723
00:39:56,861 --> 00:40:00,530
- I'M GETTING TO THAT.
- YOU'RE ON IT RIGHT NOW.

724
00:40:01,932 --> 00:40:04,000
YOU'RE ON IT RIGHT NOW

725
00:40:04,002 --> 00:40:06,136
<i>AND THAT'S HOW YOU DID</i>
<i>THE WHOLE THING</i>

726
00:40:06,138 --> 00:40:09,139
WITH THE COINS AND THE DREAMS
AND ALL THAT EARLIER.

727
00:40:09,141 --> 00:40:12,442
YEAH, I TOOK SOME TODAY.

728
00:40:12,444 --> 00:40:15,712
- IT'S FADING THOUGH.
- THE EFFECTS DON'T LAST THAT LONG?

729
00:40:15,714 --> 00:40:17,580
THE SIDE EFFECTS
DON'T LAST THAT LONG.

730
00:40:17,582 --> 00:40:20,817
THE EFFECTS WILL LAST
THE REST OF MY LIFE, I THINK.

731
00:40:20,819 --> 00:40:23,019
David's voice:
<i>MAYBE LONGER.</i>

732
00:40:23,021 --> 00:40:25,655
WOW. OKAY, SO--
SO WAIT A MINUTE.

733
00:40:25,657 --> 00:40:27,090
THE KIDS THAT DIED--

734
00:40:27,092 --> 00:40:29,893
THAT WAS THAT
RAVE OVERDOSE, WASN'T IT?

735
00:40:29,895 --> 00:40:32,695
<i>I REMEMBER ALL THAT-- A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO,</i>
<i>SEEING THAT ON THE NEWS.</i>

736
00:40:32,697 --> 00:40:34,998
I THOUGHT THEY GOT AHOLD OF SOME
TAINTED ECSTASY OR SOMETHING.

737
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,133
- YOU'RE THE GUY--
- SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

738
00:40:37,135 --> 00:40:39,936
OKAY, SO IF
I CONTACT THIS...

739
00:40:39,938 --> 00:40:42,839
DETECTIVE APPLETON,
HE'LL REMEMBER TALKING TO YOU?

740
00:40:42,841 --> 00:40:45,642
(chuckles)
GOOD LUCK FINDING HIM.

741
00:40:46,677 --> 00:40:49,546
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?

742
00:40:49,548 --> 00:40:52,482
HUH, WELL...

743
00:40:52,484 --> 00:40:54,751
I THINK YOU'VE GOT
A BOOK HERE,

744
00:40:54,753 --> 00:40:56,786
PROBABLY, IF YOU FLESH IT OUT A LITTLE BIT.

745
00:40:56,788 --> 00:40:58,922
A BOOK?

746
00:40:58,924 --> 00:41:02,025
MEANING A WORK OF FICTION?
MEANING IT'S ALL BULLSHIT?

747
00:41:02,027 --> 00:41:04,494
HEY, A STORY'S A STORY.

748
00:41:04,496 --> 00:41:06,062
I'M JUST
A FEATURE REPORTER,

749
00:41:06,064 --> 00:41:09,732
SO THE FACT THAT YOU THINK
IT HAPPENED IS MY STORY.

750
00:41:09,734 --> 00:41:13,837
YOU KNOW, I DON'T REMEMBER LEAVING
THE HOUSE WITH ANY COINS IN MY POCKET.

751
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:15,572
I THINK YOU COULD'VE
SLIPPED THEM TO ME.

752
00:41:15,574 --> 00:41:17,040
WITHOUT YOU FEELING IT?

753
00:41:17,042 --> 00:41:20,043
AND THE THING WITH THE DREAM?
COME ON, ARNIE.

754
00:41:20,045 --> 00:41:22,078
I THINK YOU'RE TRYING
TO BE ONE OF THOSE--

755
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:26,082
(laughs) ONE OF THOSE MENTALISTS,
LIKE THAT DR. MARCONI ON TV.

756
00:41:26,084 --> 00:41:29,652
(scoffs) DR.
MARCONI MAY BE THEATRICAL,

757
00:41:29,654 --> 00:41:32,755
BUT BELIEVE ME,
HE'S NOT AN ACT.

758
00:41:32,757 --> 00:41:34,924
WELL, I CAUGHT
MARCONI'S ACT IN VEGAS,

759
00:41:34,926 --> 00:41:38,061
AND YOUR STORY SOUNDS LIKE A LOT OF
THE SAME KIND OF HOCUS-POCUS TO ME.

760
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:45,502
COME WITH ME.
I WANNA SHOW YOU SOMETHING.

761
00:41:45,504 --> 00:41:48,638
- WHERE ARE WE GOING?
- JUST OUT TO MY TRUCK.

762
00:41:50,708 --> 00:41:53,510
- <i>(curtain rattles)</i>
<i>- ALL RIGHT.</i>

763
00:41:53,512 --> 00:41:54,878

764
00:41:57,081 --> 00:41:58,748
- <i>(distant barking)</i>
<i>- YOU SEE IT?</i>

765
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:03,987
NO. OR, YOU KNOW,
IT'S AN EMPTY CAGE.

766
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:06,789
TURN YOUR HEAD
SO YOU'RE LOOKING AT ME.

767
00:42:06,791 --> 00:42:09,726
YUP. (sighs)

768
00:42:09,728 --> 00:42:12,929
NOW YOU SHOULD SEE THE BOX JUST
OUT OF THE CORNER OF YOUR EYE.

769
00:42:12,931 --> 00:42:15,164
LET'S GO BACK INSIDE.
YOUR STORY WAS MORE INTERESTING.

770
00:42:15,166 --> 00:42:18,101
YOU'RE GONNA DIE, ARNIE.
SOMEDAY YOU WILL FACE THAT MOMENT.

771
00:42:18,103 --> 00:42:21,070
AND AT THAT MOMENT YOU WILL FACE
EITHER COMPLETE NONEXISTENCE

772
00:42:21,072 --> 00:42:23,973
OR YOU WILL FACE
SOMETHING EVEN STRANGER.

773
00:42:23,975 --> 00:42:26,743
ON AN ACTUAL DAY
IN THE FUTURE, ARNIE,

774
00:42:26,745 --> 00:42:29,245
YOU WILL BE
IN THE UNIMAGINABLE.

775
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:32,081
IT IS PHYSICALLY
IMPOSSIBLE TO AVOID IT.

776
00:42:32,083 --> 00:42:34,784
THINK ABOUT THAT.
NOW,

777
00:42:34,786 --> 00:42:37,053
WITHOUT TURNING
YOUR HEAD,

778
00:42:37,055 --> 00:42:39,122
LOOK AT THE BOX.

779
00:42:43,794 --> 00:42:45,562

780
00:42:45,564 --> 00:42:47,730
AH! SHIT!

OH SHIT SHIT!

783
00:42:51,169 --> 00:42:53,136

HOW THE FUCK
DID YOU DO THAT?

787
00:42:58,577 --> 00:43:00,610
WHAT THE FUCK
IS THAT THING?

788
00:43:00,612 --> 00:43:02,712
WHAT THE FUCK, MAN?

789
00:43:02,714 --> 00:43:04,614
THERE'S NO NAME
FOR IT IN THIS WORLD.

790
00:43:04,616 --> 00:43:06,249
IT'S PRETTY FREAKY
THOUGH, RIGHT?

791
00:43:06,251 --> 00:43:07,884
WAIT. NO NO NO NO. YOU--

792
00:43:07,886 --> 00:43:10,153
YOU MADE ME SEE SOMETHING.

793
00:43:10,155 --> 00:43:11,988
YOU MADE ME SEE SOMETHING
OUT OF MY OWN HEAD.

794
00:43:11,990 --> 00:43:14,691
YOU FREAKED ME OUT SO THAT
I WOULD SEE SOMETHING.

795
00:43:14,693 --> 00:43:16,025
<i>NO, IT'S REALLY THERE.</i>

796
00:43:16,027 --> 00:43:18,227
I'M SURPRISED YOU SAW IT
SO EASILY THOUGH.

797
00:43:18,229 --> 00:43:20,263
YOU MUST HAVE
AN OPEN MIND.

798
00:43:20,265 --> 00:43:23,333
MOST PEOPLE ONLY SEE IT THAT
FAST IF THEY'RE STONED OR DRUNK.

800
00:43:26,004 --> 00:43:28,071
I WANT TO TELL THE REST
OF MY STORY, ARNIE.

801
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:31,307
I NEED TO.
I NEED TO GET IT OUT.

802
00:43:31,309 --> 00:43:35,044

803
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:39,682
- THE TRUTH.
- OKAY.

804
00:43:40,718 --> 00:43:42,852

IT OUT FOR REAL.

806
00:43:44,923 --> 00:43:46,756
OKAY.

807
00:43:46,758 --> 00:43:48,091

HE'S DEAD.

814
00:44:02,107 --> 00:44:04,874
WHAT? HOW?

815
00:44:04,876 --> 00:44:07,210
- (panting)
- CALM DOWN. CALM DOWN.

816
00:44:07,212 --> 00:44:10,380

HIS PULSE STOPPED.

817
00:44:10,382 --> 00:44:13,182

ONE WILL BE HERE IN 30 SECONDS.

818

VINNIE IS A LIFEGUARD

HERE'S WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO.

822
00:44:21,192 --> 00:44:23,226
I'LL BE BACK IN FIVE MINUTES

823
00:44:23,228 --> 00:44:25,695
AND THEN YOU ARE GONNA
TELL ME THE TRUTH.

824
00:44:25,697 --> 00:44:28,131

- COULD'VE JUST TOLD ME THAT.
- <i>The only reason that you can hear me</i>

897

THAT'S RIGHT.

1029
00:57:41,892 --> 00:57:43,826
AND YOU'RE NOT
GONNA LET ME GO.

1030
00:57:43,828 --> 00:57:45,828
SO YOU UNDERSTAND MY MOOD,

1031
00:57:45,830 --> 00:57:50,232
UNDERSTAND WHY I'M OUT HERE
COMMITTING FELONIES TODAY,

1032
00:57:50,234 --> 00:57:53,202
THERE ARE SOME
VERY DARK THINGS HAPPENING

1033
00:57:54,637 --> 00:57:56,672
AND I'VE GOT
THIS LONELY FEELING

1034
00:57:56,674 --> 00:57:58,474
LIKE I'M THE ONLY ONE
WHO KNOWS,

1035
00:57:58,476 --> 00:58:00,776
<i>THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN</i>
<i>DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.</i>

<i>U.F.O. OR</i>
<i>A BIGFOOT STORY-- NO.</i>

1038
00:58:05,649 --> 00:58:08,250
YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK?
I THINK STUFF IS BOTH

1039
00:58:08,252 --> 00:58:11,186
REAL AND NOT REAL
AT THE SAME TIME.

1040
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:14,490
<i>I'M NOT A STAR TREK FAN.</i>

1041
00:58:14,492 --> 00:58:17,826
<i>I DON'T KNOW VERY MUCH ABOUT</i>
<i>OTHER DIMENSIONS AND ALL THAT.</i>

1042
00:58:17,828 --> 00:58:19,928
I'M AN OLD SCHOOL CATHOLIC.

1043
00:58:19,930 --> 00:58:21,797

<i>IT'S MORE THAN JUST</i>

1045

<i>MURDERERS AND RAPISTS</i>
<i>DOWN THERE.</i>

1046

OF THE UNIVERSE.

1048
00:58:33,177 --> 00:58:35,511

THE MORE I THINK

1049
00:58:35,513 --> 00:58:37,646
THAT IT'S NOT JUST
SOMEPLACE DOWN THERE.

1050
00:58:37,648 --> 00:58:39,581
OH NO, THAT IT'S
RIGHT HERE WITH US.

1051
00:58:39,583 --> 00:58:41,250
WE JUST CAN'T PERCEIVE IT.

1052
00:58:41,252 --> 00:58:44,219
IT'S KINDA LIKE THE COUNTRY
MUSIC RADIO STATION.

1053
00:58:44,221 --> 00:58:47,089
IT'S OUT THERE
IN THE AIR

TUNE INTO IT.

1055

<i>INTO HELL ITSELF.</i>

1060
00:59:01,705 --> 00:59:03,705
THROUGH THAT,
HE OPENED A DOOR.

1061
00:59:03,707 --> 00:59:06,041
HE BECAME THE DOOR.

1062
00:59:06,043 --> 00:59:07,276

1063
00:59:09,078 --> 00:59:10,879

<i>Couple of days,</i>

- YOU MAY DETONATE IT LIKE THIS.
- (clicks)

1305
01:16:01,958 --> 01:16:05,960
NOW THE TRIPPER
MAY NOT <i>KILL</i> KORROK,

1306
01:16:05,962 --> 01:16:08,796
BUT IT WILL SURE
FUCK HIS SHIT UP.

1307
01:16:08,798 --> 01:16:11,799
SEVERELY.
(chuckles)

1308
01:16:12,935 --> 01:16:14,902
WELL, I LIKE
THE CONCEPT, DOCTOR.

1309
01:16:14,904 --> 01:16:17,204
AH! MMM. MMM.

1310
01:16:17,206 --> 01:16:19,173
(sighs) FINE.

1311
01:16:19,175 --> 01:16:21,108
HOW DO WE GET IN?

1312
01:16:21,110 --> 01:16:25,012
JUST DECIDE THAT YOU WANT TO AND YOU WILL.

1313
01:16:34,089 --> 01:16:35,823
(warbles)

1314
01:16:44,933 --> 01:16:46,867
- <i>(portal zaps)</i>

1315

1317
01:16:53,810 --> 01:16:55,109
AH.

1318
01:16:56,878 --> 01:16:59,947
WE MUST BE IN AN ALTERNATE
UNIVERSE OF SOME KIND.

1319
01:17:10,359 --> 01:17:13,995
APPARENTLY IT'S
"EYES WIDE SHUT" WORLD.

1320
01:17:22,204 --> 01:17:24,405
GENTLEMEN, WELCOME!

1321
01:17:25,340 --> 01:17:27,642
AS YOU CAN SEE,

1322
01:17:27,644 --> 01:17:29,910
A SELECT FEW
INTERESTED PARTIES

1323
01:17:29,912 --> 01:17:34,115
<i>WERE ALLOWED TO COME</i>
<i>AND OBSERVE YOUR ARRIVAL.</i>

1324
01:17:35,317 --> 01:17:38,185
SO WE THOUGHT
REMOVING THE GARMENTS

1325
01:17:38,187 --> 01:17:40,354
<i>WOULD LESSEN</i>
<i>YOUR DISCOMFORT.</i>

1326
01:17:40,356 --> 01:17:42,323
YES. A VERY NICE TOUCH.

1327
01:17:42,325 --> 01:17:45,660
GOOD! COME.

1328
01:17:50,832 --> 01:17:53,234
GENTLEMEN, WELCOME!

1329
01:17:55,003 --> 01:17:56,904
I THINK THEY WERE
EXPECTING US.

1330
01:18:00,042 --> 01:18:02,009
I LIKE THE LITTLE
TOUCHES THOUGH.

1331
01:18:04,946 --> 01:18:09,183
- (whimpers)
- I SUPPOSE YOU ARE WONDERING WHERE YOU ARE.

1332
01:18:09,185 --> 01:18:12,086
I'M GONNA GUESS WE'RE IN AN
ALTERNATE UNIVERSE OF SOME KIND.

1333
01:18:12,088 --> 01:18:14,221
WELL, THAT IS CORRECT.

1334
01:18:14,223 --> 01:18:18,059
TELL ME-- WHAT WAS IT LIKE PASSING THROUGH?

1335
01:18:18,061 --> 01:18:20,728
I WASN'T REALLY
PAYING ATTENTION.

1336
01:18:20,730 --> 01:18:22,930
YEAH, IT REALLY WASN'T
THAT GREAT.

1337
01:18:22,932 --> 01:18:26,033
WE HAVE BEEN AWAITING
YOUR COMING.

1338
01:18:26,035 --> 01:18:28,436
WE HAVE WORKED VERY HARD
FOR MANY YEARS,

1339
01:18:28,438 --> 01:18:31,038
<i>SUFFERED MANY TRAGIC SETBACKS IN AN ATTEMPT</i>

1340
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:34,008
<i>TO FIND AND COMMUNICATE</i>
<i>WITH YOUR WORLD.</i>

1341
01:18:34,010 --> 01:18:37,378
YOUR WORLD, YOU SEE,
IS A TWIN TO OUR OWN,

1342
01:18:37,380 --> 01:18:41,048
DUAL OFFSPRING
BORN OF THE SAME LITTER.

1343
01:18:41,050 --> 01:18:43,451
WATCH!
UP UNTIL THIS POINT,

1344
01:18:43,453 --> 01:18:46,020
<i>OUR HISTORIES WERE IDENTICAL.</i>

1345
01:18:46,022 --> 01:18:49,290
THERE WAS A MAN NAMED
CYRUS ROONEY FROM TENNESSEE.

1346
01:18:49,292 --> 01:18:52,393
<i>IN YOUR WORLD,</i>
<i>HE DIED AT THE AGE OF 17,</i>

1347
01:18:52,395 --> 01:18:57,798
GORED TO DEATH WHILE TRYING TO
CROSSBREED A BULL WITH A CLYDESDALE.

1348
01:18:57,800 --> 01:19:00,367
<i>IN OUR WORLD,</i>
<i>THE MAN SURVIVED.</i>

1349
01:19:00,369 --> 01:19:03,170
<i>HERE, CYRUS ROONEY WAS</i>
<i>A GENIUS.</i>

1350
01:19:03,172 --> 01:19:07,775
HE CONTINUED TO EXPERIMENT
IN WHAT HE CALLED BEASTIOLOGY.

1351
01:19:07,777 --> 01:19:11,412
YES. PEOPLE FROM OUR SOUTH
ARE INTO THAT AS WELL.

1352
01:19:11,414 --> 01:19:14,048
- (chuckles)
- YOU SEE, BY 1881

1353
01:19:14,050 --> 01:19:16,951
HIS GROUP HAD
INSECTILE FLYING MACHINES.

1354
01:19:16,953 --> 01:19:21,789
IN 1902 HE CREATED THE FIRST
PRIMITIVE THINKING MACHINE

1355
01:19:21,791 --> 01:19:23,991
OUT OF THE BRAIN
OF A PIG.

1356
01:19:25,994 --> 01:19:28,062
(snorting)

1357
01:19:29,531 --> 01:19:32,767
YOU SEE,
BY YOUR YEAR 1922

1358
01:19:32,769 --> 01:19:34,435
<i>WE ALREADY HAD</i>
<i>SELF-FEEDING,</i>

1359
01:19:34,437 --> 01:19:37,838
<i>SELF-HEALING,</i>
<i>SELF-MODIFYING COMPUTERS.</i>

1360
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:41,809
IN 1926
MR. ROONEY PASSED AWAY.

1361
01:19:41,811 --> 01:19:44,078
AND THEN SOMETHING
MIRACULOUS HAPPENED

1362
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:47,014
TO THE GREATEST
OF HIS CREATIONS.

1363
01:19:47,016 --> 01:19:50,284
<i>THE VERY DAY MR. ROONEY PASSED,</i>
<i>IT BECAME SENTIENT.</i>

1364
01:19:50,286 --> 01:19:52,520
<i>IT GAVE A NAME</i>
<i>UNTO ITSELF</i>

1365
01:19:52,522 --> 01:19:55,122
AND EXPRESSED
DESIRES AND EMOTIONS.

1366
01:19:55,124 --> 01:19:59,260
AND FROM THAT DAY FORWARD, THIS ASTONISHING
CREATURE CARRIED ON ROONEY'S WORK

1367
01:19:59,262 --> 01:20:01,462
AND CONFORMED
ALL LIVING NATURE

1368
01:20:01,464 --> 01:20:04,498
TO URGE ON THE ADVANCEMENT
OF MANKIND.

1369
01:20:04,500 --> 01:20:06,901
FOR SOME,
THIS PROCESS WAS EASY.

1370
01:20:06,903 --> 01:20:09,170
OTHERS REQUIRED
RE-EDUCATION.

1371
01:20:09,172 --> 01:20:10,971
WATCH!

1372
01:20:10,973 --> 01:20:12,840
(squeaks)
MAMA.

1373
01:20:12,842 --> 01:20:14,975
- (people shouting)
- OW! OW!

1374
01:20:14,977 --> 01:20:17,978
NO! PLEASE!
NO! OH! OH!

1375
01:20:17,980 --> 01:20:20,414
OH MY GOD!

TO PROCESS THE MAGNANIMITY
THAT IS KORROK

1379
01:20:33,429 --> 01:20:35,830
FOR YOUR SIMPLER MINDS,

1380
01:20:35,832 --> 01:20:38,499
WE HAVE TRANSLATED
THE FOLLOWING IMAGES

1381
01:20:38,501 --> 01:20:40,568
INTO A FORMAT
THAT WE THINK

1382
01:20:40,570 --> 01:20:42,903
THAT YOU WILL FIND
MORE FAMILIAR.

1383
01:20:42,905 --> 01:20:46,240
I BELIEVE IN YOUR WORLD
THEY'RE CALLED CARTOONS.

1384

MAMA!

Largeman: <i>THERE ARE ALWAYS
THOSE WHO RESIST PROGRESS.</i>

1391
01:21:19,041 --> 01:21:21,976
IN OUR WORLD
IT IS CONSIDERED A CRIME.

1392
01:21:21,978 --> 01:21:26,113
ON OUR WORLD IT'S CONSIDERED A GREATER CRIME

1393
01:21:26,115 --> 01:21:30,451
TO UNLEASH KILLER SPIDERS
ON AN UNARMED CROWD.

1394
01:21:30,453 --> 01:21:33,220
WE CALL THAT ARACHNICIDE.

1395
01:21:33,222 --> 01:21:35,422
BUT WHAT IF YOU HAD
A THINKING MACHINE?

1396
01:21:35,424 --> 01:21:37,224
AN ENTITY SO POWERFUL

1397
01:21:37,226 --> 01:21:40,027
THAT IT COULD FORESEE
THE OUTCOME OF ANY ACTION?

1398
01:21:40,029 --> 01:21:41,595
FOLLOW ME.

1399
01:21:45,133 --> 01:21:47,534
WE ARE ALL
VERY EXCITED

1400
01:21:47,536 --> 01:21:49,370
THAT YOU COULD
JOIN US.

1401
01:21:57,545 --> 01:21:59,513
ARE YOU THINKING
WHAT I'M THINKING?

1402
01:21:59,515 --> 01:22:01,982
THAT IF FRANZ KAFKA
WAS HERE,

1403
01:22:01,984 --> 01:22:05,085
- HIS HEAD WOULD EXPLODE?
- ACTUALLY, YEAH.

1404
01:22:05,087 --> 01:22:07,354
GENTLEMEN, YOU ARE
ABOUT TO SEE SOMETHING

1405
01:22:07,356 --> 01:22:10,658
VERY FEW OTHERS
HAVE SEEN BEFORE YOU--

1406
01:22:11,693 --> 01:22:14,228
THE ULTIMATE MANIFESTATION

1407
01:22:14,230 --> 01:22:16,330
<i>OF CYRUS ROONEY'S CREATION.</i>

1409
01:22:19,534 --> 01:22:21,936
DAVE, JOHN,

1410
01:22:21,938 --> 01:22:23,671
MEET KORROK.

1411
01:22:36,351 --> 01:22:38,419
- <i>(loudly) I AM KORROK.</i>
<i>- (Dave and John grunting)</i>

1412
01:22:38,421 --> 01:22:42,122
(Korrok laughs)
WELCOME.

1413
01:22:42,124 --> 01:22:44,692
<i>YOUR WIENER IS</i>
<i>EVEN SMALLER IN PERSON.</i>

1414

- Both: WHAT?
- WITH A TINY CHANGE IN YOUR BRAIN CHEMISTRY,

1415
01:22:47,630 --> 01:22:50,965
- <i>I COULD MAKE YOU A CHILD MOLESTER.</i>
<i>- (children laugh)</i>

1416
01:22:50,967 --> 01:22:53,500
- WHAT DO YOU WANT?
- Korrok: <i>NOT BIG BLACK COCKS,</i>

1417
01:22:53,502 --> 01:22:55,369
<i>SO WE DON'T HAVE</i>
<i>THAT IN COMMON.</i>

1418
01:22:55,371 --> 01:22:57,237
GET THE FUCK
OUT OF MY HEAD!

1419
01:22:59,341 --> 01:23:02,676
DAVID WONG,
SON OF AN INSANE PROSTITUTE

1420
01:23:02,678 --> 01:23:05,412
<i>AND A MENTALLY-CHALLENGED</i>
<i>AMWAY SALESMAN.</i>

<i>- ...IN OUR WORLD.</i>

<i>20 YEARS AGO</i>
<i>KORROK FORETOLD YOUR COMING.</i>

1426
01:23:18,427 --> 01:23:21,562
<i>WE HAVE NEVER TRAVELED</i>
<i>FROM OUR PLANE TO YOURS.</i>

DAVE, JOHN,

01:23:27,103 --> 01:23:30,471
YOUR ARRIVAL HERE
IS A NEW DAWN.

1430
01:23:30,473 --> 01:23:34,408
YOU CAN SHOW US THE WAY TO GO
FROM OUR WORLD TO YOUR OWN.

1431
01:23:34,410 --> 01:23:36,343
YOU SEE, IN OUR WORLD,

1432
01:23:36,345 --> 01:23:39,346
WHEN SOMEONE IS BORN
WITH SPECIAL WISDOM,

1433
01:23:39,348 --> 01:23:41,415
HE SHARES IT WITH KORROK

1434
01:23:41,417 --> 01:23:44,118
SO THAT KORROK
COULD BE GREATER.

1435
01:23:44,120 --> 01:23:45,285

<i>OF KORROK'S NEURAL WEB.</i>

1470
01:25:57,786 --> 01:25:59,786
OUR LEGIONS ARE READY
FOR THE CALL.

1471
01:25:59,788 --> 01:26:02,523
- <i>AND SOON ALL OF YOUR TURMOIL...</i>
<i>- (beeping)</i>

1472

<i>...AND UNREST</i>
<i>AND CONFUSION</i>

1473
01:26:05,661 --> 01:26:09,663

1474
01:26:09,665 --> 01:26:11,832
- HMM?
- (Bark Lee growls)

1475
01:26:11,834 --> 01:26:14,868
- HMM?
- (beeps)

(both panting)

1478
01:26:25,247 --> 01:26:28,248
DID BARK LEE JUST
SACRIFICE HIS LIFE?

1479
01:26:28,250 --> 01:26:31,952
- DAMN. THAT DOG JUST SAVED THE UNIVERSE.
- AMY'S GONNA KILL ME.

1480
01:26:33,288 --> 01:26:34,454
WE MUST HURRY.

1481
01:26:35,456 --> 01:26:37,858
(man yells)

1482
01:26:40,461 --> 01:26:41,895
MOVE. NOW!

1483
01:26:45,366 --> 01:26:48,468
WAIT. IF YOU COULD
CROSS OVER HERE SO EASILY,

1484
01:26:48,470 --> 01:26:50,938
WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST DELIVER
THE FREAKING BOMB? WHY US?

1485
01:26:50,940 --> 01:26:53,907
WE NEEDED TO SEND SOMEONE THEY
WOULD CONSIDER TOTALLY INNOCUOUS--

1486
01:26:53,909 --> 01:26:56,443
COMPLETELY UNABLE TO POSE
A SERIOUS THREAT.

1487
01:26:56,445 --> 01:26:59,213
BESIDES, THE DOG
NEEDED AN ESCORT.

1488
01:26:59,215 --> 01:27:01,648
YES. GOOD THINKING.

1489
01:27:03,218 --> 01:27:05,385
Arnie:
<i>SO MARCONI SAVED THE DAY.</i>

1490
01:27:05,387 --> 01:27:07,421
<i>HUH.</i>

1491
01:27:07,423 --> 01:27:09,556
- KORROK STILL EXISTS?
- FROM OUR WORLD,

1492
01:27:09,558 --> 01:27:11,425
IT'S HARD TO REALLY
KNOW FOR SURE.

1493
01:27:11,427 --> 01:27:13,427
BUT IT'S NO SECRET
THAT THERE'S

1494
01:27:13,429 --> 01:27:15,562
STILL STRANGE STUFF
GOING DOWN IN THIS TOWN.

1495
01:27:15,564 --> 01:27:17,998
WHAT ABOUT THE GIRL, AMY?
WHAT HAPPENED TO HER?

1496
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,434
AMY WASN'T TOO HAPPY
ABOUT HER DOG.

1497
01:27:20,436 --> 01:27:23,337
THE SOY SAUCE THAT THE
DOG INGESTED WHEN HE BIT

1498
01:27:23,339 --> 01:27:26,406
THE JAMAICAN GUY ALLOWED BARK
LEE TO PSYCHICALLY CONNECT

1499
01:27:26,408 --> 01:27:27,608
<i>WITH NORTH AND MARCONI.</i>

1500
01:27:27,610 --> 01:27:30,010
SO THE DOG KNEW
WHAT HAD TO BE DONE

1501
01:27:30,012 --> 01:27:33,413
<i>AND WAS WILLING TO MAKE</i>
<i>THE ULTIMATE SACRIFICE.</i>

1502
01:27:34,349 --> 01:27:35,816
AS TO AMY...

1503
01:27:35,818 --> 01:27:38,452
<i>SHE'S BEEN MY GIRLFRIEND</i>
<i>EVER SINCE.</i>

1504
01:27:38,454 --> 01:27:40,520
<i>(birds chirping)</i>

1505
01:27:46,628 --> 01:27:48,695
<i>I GOT HER OUT</i>
<i>OF TOWN THOUGH.</i>

1506
01:27:48,697 --> 01:27:50,297
SHE'S UPSTATE AT COLLEGE.

1507
01:27:50,299 --> 01:27:52,633
GOT A 3.7 G.P.A.

1508
01:27:52,635 --> 01:27:54,468
GOOD FOR HER.
AND JOHN?

1509
01:27:54,470 --> 01:27:57,638
WHAT, UH-- WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM?
HE SURVIVED TOO?

1510
01:27:57,640 --> 01:27:59,673
WE SHOOT HOOPS A LOT--

1511
01:27:59,675 --> 01:28:02,776
WHENEVER WE'RE NOT
TOO BUSY WITH, UH, WORK.

1512
01:28:06,314 --> 01:28:08,348
WHAT THE HELL, MR. WONG.

1513
01:28:08,350 --> 01:28:10,450
I SAY WE JUST
GO PUBLIC WITH IT,

1514
01:28:10,452 --> 01:28:12,386
WITH YOUR STORY.

1515
01:28:12,388 --> 01:28:15,289
BUT JUST TELLING OUR STORY,
THAT'S NOT GOING TO DO SHIT.

1516
01:28:15,291 --> 01:28:17,457
THE TESTIMONY
OF TWO NUTJOBS--

1517
01:28:17,459 --> 01:28:20,060
THAT'S JUST GOING TO GET US LUMPED
IN WITH ALL THE ROSWELL LOSERS.

1518
01:28:20,062 --> 01:28:22,496
AH, I SEE. OKAY.

1519
01:28:22,498 --> 01:28:24,398
SO WHAT DO YOU WANNA DO?

1520
01:28:24,400 --> 01:28:25,999
WE SHOW THEM THIS--

1521
01:28:26,001 --> 01:28:28,068
A PHYSICAL PIECE
OF EVIDENCE.

1522
01:28:28,070 --> 01:28:31,305
I'M THINKING IF YOU CAN GET
THIS IN THE HANDS OF SOMEONE,

1523
01:28:31,307 --> 01:28:32,839
<i>LIKE A--</i>
<i>LIKE A LAB OR SOMETHING.</i>

1524
01:28:32,841 --> 01:28:34,675
YEAH. YEAH.

1525
01:28:34,677 --> 01:28:37,544
SOMEONE WITH
AN ELECTRON MICROSCOPE.

1526
01:28:37,546 --> 01:28:39,546
RIGHT? (laughs)
'CAUSE I'M THINKING

1527
01:28:39,548 --> 01:28:42,783
WHOEVER TAKES THE FIRST
CLOSE LOOK AT YOUR SOY SAUCE

1528
01:28:42,785 --> 01:28:44,551
IS GONNA HAVE
A BROWN STAIN DOWN

1529
01:28:44,553 --> 01:28:46,820
THE BOTTOM OF HIS LAB COAT
A <i>SECOND</i>LATER.

1530
01:28:46,822 --> 01:28:49,089
YES!
MAKE THAT THE STORY.

1531
01:28:49,091 --> 01:28:51,091
HELL, LET 'EM SEE
THE EFFECTS THEMSELVES.

1532
01:28:51,093 --> 01:28:53,927
JUST FEED THAT SHIT TO A LAB
RAT AND WATCH THE FUN BEGIN--

1533
01:28:53,929 --> 01:28:57,831
WATCH THAT THING START
LEVITATING AND SPEAKING FRENCH!

1534
01:28:57,833 --> 01:29:01,001
AND YOU'RE-- YOU'RE WILLING TO RISK
EVERYTHING? YOUR LIFE, YOUR FAMILY?

1535
01:29:01,003 --> 01:29:02,769
BECAUSE, I MEAN,
BEST CASE SCENARIO,

1536
01:29:02,771 --> 01:29:04,671
YOUR CAREER AS A JOURNALIST
IS GONNA BE OVER

1537
01:29:04,673 --> 01:29:06,740
BECAUSE THIS IS ALL ANYONE'S
EVER GONNA REMEMBER YOU FOR.

1538
01:29:06,742 --> 01:29:09,676
AND DON'T FORGET THAT THERE
MAY BE PEOPLE OUT THERE--

1539
01:29:09,678 --> 01:29:12,579
REAL PEOPLE--
WHO DON'T WANT THIS OUT.

1540
01:29:12,581 --> 01:29:15,415
OH SHIT.
COME ON, WONG.

1541
01:29:15,417 --> 01:29:18,685
I'VE BEEN AROUND.
WONG, I'VE BEEN AROUND.

1542
01:29:18,687 --> 01:29:21,421
MY FIRST YEAR OUT
OF JOURNALISM SCHOOL,

1543
01:29:21,423 --> 01:29:24,758
I GOT KNOCKED COLD COVERING DEVIL'S
NIGHT FOR THE "DETROIT TRIBUNE."

1544
01:29:24,760 --> 01:29:26,927
<i>THAT WAS 1984.</i>

1545
01:29:26,929 --> 01:29:29,629
I WOKE UP WITH MY CAMERA
BUSTED ON THE PAVEMENT,

1546
01:29:29,631 --> 01:29:31,598
BLOOD RUNNING
DOWN MY SHIRT,

1547
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:33,567
A BIG FAT COP
STANDING OVER ME

1548
01:29:33,569 --> 01:29:35,469
AND HE SAYS,
"STAY DOWN, NIGGER."

1549
01:29:36,971 --> 01:29:39,439
SO I THINK I KNEW THEN
WHAT I WAS DOING THIS JOB FOR,

1550
01:29:39,441 --> 01:29:41,007
AND IN THE YEARS SINCE--

1551
01:29:41,009 --> 01:29:42,442
<i>WHAT?</i>

1552
01:29:44,712 --> 01:29:46,413
WHAT, WONG?

1553
01:29:46,415 --> 01:29:48,615
THEY, UH--

1554
01:29:48,617 --> 01:29:51,385
THEY CALLED YOU
THE N-WORD?

1555
01:29:52,520 --> 01:29:55,155
WHY ON EARTH
WOULD THEY DO THAT?

1556
01:29:55,157 --> 01:29:57,724
WHAT? IS THAT
SOME KIND OF JOKE?

1557
01:29:57,726 --> 01:30:01,528
(laughing)

1558
01:30:01,530 --> 01:30:03,463
WHY ARE YOU LAUGHING?

1559
01:30:06,167 --> 01:30:10,737
- OH MY GOD.
- HEY! HEY!

1560
01:30:10,739 --> 01:30:13,039
HEY, ASSHOLE,
ANSWER ME!

1561
01:30:13,041 --> 01:30:14,608
- OW.
- WHAT?!

1562
01:30:14,610 --> 01:30:16,777
I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN.

1563
01:30:16,779 --> 01:30:19,679
DESCRIBE YOURSELF TO ME,
ARNIE-- PHYSICALLY.

1564
01:30:19,681 --> 01:30:23,784
- TELL ME WHAT YOU LOOK LIKE.
- OH, NO NO NO NO NO NO NO.

1565
01:30:23,786 --> 01:30:26,153
YOU'RE FUCKING WITH ME.

1566
01:30:26,155 --> 01:30:28,655
'CAUSE TO ME
YOU'RE NOT BLACK, ARNIE.

1567
01:30:28,657 --> 01:30:32,559
TO ME YOU'RE A SLOPPY
WHITE GUY

1568
01:30:32,561 --> 01:30:35,162

01:30:59,554 --> 01:31:01,221
COME ON, ARNIE.
(sighs)

1574
01:31:01,223 --> 01:31:04,991
OPEN IT. THE SOONER YOU DO,
THE SOONER WE CAN MOVE ON.

(gasps, breathes heavily)

1576
01:31:13,234 --> 01:31:16,770
I'M SORRY, ARNIE.
I REALLY AM.

1577
01:31:16,772 --> 01:31:18,672
YOU DID THIS TO ME.

1578
01:31:20,007 --> 01:31:21,541
YOU DID THIS TO ME.

1579
01:31:21,543 --> 01:31:24,244
YOU KILLED ME,
YOU SON OF A BITCH!

1580

- LOOK AT YOUR BODY, ARNIE.

THE ONE IN THE TRUNK,
I MEAN.

1582
01:31:31,552 --> 01:31:34,488
YOU'VE BEEN DEAD FOR DAYS.
I THINK SOMEONE GOT WIND

01:31:34,490 --> 01:31:36,890
THAT YOU HAD CONTACTED ME

I'M NOT A FUCKING GHOST.

1586
01:31:41,263 --> 01:31:44,130

FOR LIKE TWO HOURS.

1633
01:34:11,145 --> 01:34:12,912
TIME MUST MOVE
DIFFERENT HERE.

1634
01:34:12,914 --> 01:34:14,414
I CAME RIGHT AFTER YOU.

1635
01:34:14,416 --> 01:34:16,282
AT LEAST
IT'S COOLER HERE.

1636
01:34:29,664 --> 01:34:31,765
<i>(woman rasping)</i>
<i>YOU!</i>

1637
01:34:31,767 --> 01:34:33,333
UNSTAINED!

1638
01:34:33,335 --> 01:34:35,035
HOW?!

1639
01:34:44,111 --> 01:34:46,212
(chittering)

1640
01:34:47,815 --> 01:34:50,150
(snarls)

1641
01:34:55,122 --> 01:34:57,724
<i>(whooshing)</i>

1642
01:34:59,226 --> 01:35:01,428
(booms)

1643
01:35:11,138 --> 01:35:14,708
I AM SERGEANT VANCE McELROY
OF THE HUMAN LIBERATION ARMY.

1644
01:35:14,710 --> 01:35:18,078
PROPHECY HAS FORETOLD THE COMING
OF STRANGERS FROM ANOTHER WORLD.

1645
01:35:18,080 --> 01:35:20,180
<i>IT IS AN HONOR</i>
<i>TO MEET YOU.</i>

1646
01:35:21,916 --> 01:35:23,783
<i>I MUST CONFESS I DO NOT KNOW</i>
<i>FROM WHERE YOU CAME,</i>

1647
01:35:23,785 --> 01:35:25,318
BUT I CAN TELL
BY LOOKING AT YOU

1648
01:35:25,320 --> 01:35:28,088
THAT YOU HAVE NOT BEEN INFECTED
WITH THE GREAT DISEASE.

1649
01:35:28,090 --> 01:35:30,190
<i>I ASSUME WE SHARE</i>
<i>A COMMON ENEMY.</i>

1650
01:35:30,192 --> 01:35:33,793
IF YOU CANNOT DEFEAT HIM,
THEN ALL HOPE FOR MANKIND WILL BE LOST.

1651
01:35:33,795 --> 01:35:36,930
<i>GENTLEMEN, THE WINDS OF DESTINY</i>
<i>HAVE BLOWN US TOGETHER.</i>

1652
01:35:36,932 --> 01:35:40,867
A BRIGHT DAWN IS ABOUT TO MARK
THIS LOST AND BROKEN WORLD.

1653
01:35:40,869 --> 01:35:43,937
- TYRANNY WILL FOREVER BE OVERCOME WITH--
- John: <i>YEAH YEAH YEAH.</i>

1654
01:35:43,939 --> 01:35:46,072
THAT'S VERY INTERESTING,

1655
01:35:46,074 --> 01:35:48,108
BUT TO PERFORM THIS TASK

1656
01:35:48,110 --> 01:35:50,944
WE'LL NEED A NUMBER
OF ITEMS FROM OUR WORLD.

1657
01:35:50,946 --> 01:35:53,279
SO YOU MUST
LET US RETURN THERE

1658
01:35:53,281 --> 01:35:57,183
AND COME BACK
TO BEGIN OUR QUEST.

1659
01:35:57,185 --> 01:36:00,386
IT IS GOOD THEN.
WE SHALL AWAIT YOUR RETURN.

1660
01:36:00,388 --> 01:36:03,289
BUT AS YOU DEPART, KNOW THAT
WE OF THE H.L.A. RESISTANCE

1661
01:36:03,291 --> 01:36:05,792
WILL ALWAYS AND FOREVER BE IN YOUR DEBT,

1662
01:36:05,794 --> 01:36:08,528
<i>FOR BOTH OF YOU MARK</i>
<i>ALL THAT IS GOOD AND PROMISING.</i>

1663
01:36:08,530 --> 01:36:10,296
<i>AND THE FACT</i>
<i>THAT ALL GOOD...</i>

1664
01:36:10,298 --> 01:36:13,466
- (distorted speech)
- <i>(dramatic music playing)</i>

1665
01:36:41,061 --> 01:36:43,129
<i>(rock music playing)</i>

1666
01:36:46,433 --> 01:36:48,802
<i>â™ª THIS IS HOW I'M FEELING</i>

1667
01:36:48,804 --> 01:36:51,304
<i>â™ª THERE IS A PAINTER</i>

1668
01:36:51,306 --> 01:36:53,540
<i>â™ª ANGEL DE WOMAN</i>

1669
01:36:53,542 --> 01:36:56,943
<i>â™ª SHE CLEARLY SAID "NO"</i>

1670
01:36:56,945 --> 01:37:01,581
<i>â™ª HE IS LISTENING</i>
<i>TO EVERYTHING I'M SAYING â™ª</i>

1671
01:37:01,583 --> 01:37:03,349
<i>â™ª FEELS LIKE THIS MOUNTAIN</i>

1672
01:37:03,351 --> 01:37:06,319
<i>â™ª DANTE FINALLY</i>
<i>RAN ITS STRIDE â™ª</i>

1673
01:37:11,592 --> 01:37:14,227
<i>â™ª BUT THE ROOT</i>
<i>OF ALL THAT IS â™ª</i>

1674
01:37:14,229 --> 01:37:16,896
<i>â™ª HIDDEN IN THE MIDDLE</i>

1675
01:37:16,898 --> 01:37:21,201
<i>â™ª HIDDEN FOR THE FACT</i>
<i>THAT IT TORE HIM APART â™ª</i>

1676
01:37:21,203 --> 01:37:24,437
<i>â™ª WHAT ABOUT</i>
<i>THAT SMACK BEING â™ª</i>

1677
01:37:24,439 --> 01:37:26,940
<i>â™ª TOSSED AROUND</i>

1678
01:37:26,942 --> 01:37:28,608
