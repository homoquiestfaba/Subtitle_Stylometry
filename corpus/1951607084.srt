1
00:01:08,118 --> 00:01:10,029
I have long feared...

2
00:01:10,878 --> 00:01:14,268
...that my sins would return
to visit me.

3
00:01:15,558 --> 00:01:18,197
And the cost is more than I can bear.

4
00:01:45,038 --> 00:01:47,029
Samuel! A postrider!

5
00:01:57,758 --> 00:01:58,668
An "R."

6
00:01:58,878 --> 00:01:59,993
Good.

7
00:02:01,758 --> 00:02:02,907
What about this one?

8
00:02:39,838 --> 00:02:41,669
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

9
00:03:22,398 --> 00:03:24,787
Father! Father!

10
00:03:26,118 --> 00:03:29,906
Nine pounds, eleven ounces.
That's perfect. Perfect.

11
00:03:30,438 --> 00:03:32,315
Father, a postrider!

12
00:03:32,998 --> 00:03:34,511
Did you finish planting
the field?

13
00:03:34,918 --> 00:03:35,873
More than half.

14
00:03:36,078 --> 00:03:39,275
Those swimming breaks really cut
into the day, don't they?

15
00:03:41,398 --> 00:03:42,717
Told you.

16
00:03:52,718 --> 00:03:53,946
Thomas.

17
00:03:54,198 --> 00:03:55,597
Wait for Father.

18
00:04:53,118 --> 00:04:54,028
Sorry.

19
00:04:55,758 --> 00:05:00,195
South Carolina 1776

20
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:28,587
That's her. The North Star.

21
00:05:29,718 --> 00:05:30,867
See?

22
00:05:31,198 --> 00:05:34,349
You start from the front two stars
of the Big Dipper.

23
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:36,311
And then you count up.

24
00:05:36,598 --> 00:05:39,670
You count up five finger lengths...

25
00:05:39,878 --> 00:05:42,517
...and it's right there.

26
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:46,437
And she'll always be
looking down on us.

27
00:05:46,758 --> 00:05:49,750
And protect us. Forever.

28
00:05:51,678 --> 00:05:53,157
Come. Into bed.

29
00:06:00,518 --> 00:06:02,827
Good night. Good night, Meg.

30
00:06:04,438 --> 00:06:07,077
It helps her to know Mother's there.

31
00:06:11,478 --> 00:06:12,513
Good night.

32
00:06:52,798 --> 00:06:54,675
So what was in the mail?

33
00:07:20,278 --> 00:07:22,234
Peter Cuppin joined the Continentals.

34
00:07:28,478 --> 00:07:30,708
He's 17, a year younger than I.

35
00:07:40,998 --> 00:07:44,877
Well, the assembly's been convened,
so I've been called to Charles Town.

36
00:07:45,078 --> 00:07:47,148
- We're going to Charles Town?
- We are.

37
00:07:47,358 --> 00:07:48,586
We leave in the morning.

38
00:08:30,038 --> 00:08:31,357
Aunt Charlotte!

39
00:08:32,598 --> 00:08:34,350
Margaret, William, look at you.

40
00:08:35,318 --> 00:08:36,751
Missed you.

41
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:40,026
They're huge.
What have you been feeding them?

42
00:08:40,798 --> 00:08:44,154
Well, they're from good stock.
On their mother's side, of course.

43
00:08:45,158 --> 00:08:48,594
Thank you. Come inside.
Wait until you see what I have.

44
00:08:48,798 --> 00:08:51,153
- Presents? Presents for us?
- Move slowly.

45
00:08:51,358 --> 00:08:53,747
Keep an eye on these heathens,
will you?

46
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:57,073
Sorry.

47
00:09:04,918 --> 00:09:08,797
I have this for you, Susan.
It belonged to your mother.

48
00:09:14,718 --> 00:09:16,709
She's still not talking?

49
00:09:18,118 --> 00:09:19,073
No.

50
00:09:22,198 --> 00:09:23,950
It does me good to see you.

51
00:09:30,918 --> 00:09:32,271
Look, there's Gabriel.

52
00:09:39,758 --> 00:09:41,316
Hang King George!

53
00:09:44,358 --> 00:09:47,350
- Hang them all!
- Hang the lot of them!

54
00:09:53,998 --> 00:09:56,114
My name is Peter Howard.

55
00:09:56,678 --> 00:10:00,034
I lost most of my hearing
and my left leg...

56
00:10:00,478 --> 00:10:03,754
...fighting for the Crown
in the French and Indian War.

57
00:10:04,438 --> 00:10:07,032
And how did King George reward me?

58
00:10:07,318 --> 00:10:09,912
He cuts off my other leg
with his taxes.

59
00:10:11,398 --> 00:10:13,116
Miss Howard, isn't it?

60
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:16,149
You know who I am, Gabriel Martin.

61
00:10:17,558 --> 00:10:21,437
The last time you saw me,
I was 11 and you put ink in my tea.

62
00:10:22,278 --> 00:10:26,351
I believe that was one of my younger
brothers. Perhaps Samuel or Nathan.

63
00:10:26,838 --> 00:10:30,797
It was you, and it turned
my teeth black for a month.

64
00:10:33,238 --> 00:10:37,834
- And send a message to King George
he will never forget!

65
00:10:39,998 --> 00:10:41,317
Our first order of business...

66
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:43,355
And our last, if we vote a levy!

67
00:10:43,838 --> 00:10:44,907
Order, order!

68
00:10:45,118 --> 00:10:47,074
Mr. Simms, you do not have the floor.

69
00:10:47,358 --> 00:10:51,271
First, an address by Colonel
Harry Burwell of the Continental Army.

70
00:10:51,478 --> 00:10:52,797
Colonel Burwell.

71
00:10:56,478 --> 00:10:58,514
You all know why I'm here.

72
00:10:59,118 --> 00:11:00,710
I'm not an orator.

73
00:11:01,398 --> 00:11:05,437
And I would not try to convince you
of the worthiness of our cause.

74
00:11:06,718 --> 00:11:08,197
I'm a soldier.

75
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:11,074
And we are at war.

76
00:11:11,678 --> 00:11:15,068
From Philadelphia, we expect
a declaration of independence.

77
00:11:15,838 --> 00:11:18,193
8 of the 13 colonies have
levied money...

78
00:11:18,398 --> 00:11:20,434
...in support of a continental army.

79
00:11:20,878 --> 00:11:23,153
I ask that South Carolina be the ninth.

80
00:11:23,678 --> 00:11:26,750
Massachusetts and Virginia
may be at war...

81
00:11:26,998 --> 00:11:29,034
...but South Carolina is not!

82
00:11:29,238 --> 00:11:30,227
Hear, hear.

83
00:11:30,518 --> 00:11:34,397
This is not a war for the independence
of one or two colonies...

84
00:11:34,718 --> 00:11:36,868
...but for the independence
of one nation.

85
00:11:37,078 --> 00:11:39,034
And what nation is that?

86
00:11:39,238 --> 00:11:41,354
An American nation!

87
00:11:41,558 --> 00:11:44,072
There is no such nation
and to speak of one is treason.

88
00:11:44,278 --> 00:11:47,076
We are citizens of an American nation.

89
00:11:47,278 --> 00:11:49,792
And our rights are being threatened...

90
00:11:49,998 --> 00:11:52,466
...by a tyrant 3000 miles away.

91
00:11:52,718 --> 00:11:55,073
Would you tell me, please,
Mr. Howard...

92
00:11:55,278 --> 00:11:58,987
...why should I trade one tyrant
3000 miles away...

93
00:11:59,198 --> 00:12:01,951
...for 3000 tyrants one mile away?

94
00:12:06,718 --> 00:12:10,870
An elected legislature can trample
a man's rights as easily as a king can.

95
00:12:12,158 --> 00:12:13,307
Captain Martin...

96
00:12:14,758 --> 00:12:16,396
...I understood you to be a patriot.

97
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:20,314
If you mean by 'patriot,' am I angry
about taxation without representation?

98
00:12:20,518 --> 00:12:21,792
Well, yes, I am.

99
00:12:22,838 --> 00:12:26,990
Should the American colonies govern
themselves independently?

100
00:12:27,318 --> 00:12:30,037
I believe they can. And they should.

101
00:12:30,838 --> 00:12:34,308
But if you're asking me am I willing
to go to war with England...

102
00:12:34,518 --> 00:12:37,078
...then the answer is
most definitely no.

103
00:12:41,318 --> 00:12:45,391
This from the same Captain Benjamin
Martin whose fury was so famous...

104
00:12:45,798 --> 00:12:47,675
...during the Wilderness campaign?

105
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:50,710
I was intemperate in my youth.

106
00:12:50,918 --> 00:12:52,715
Temperance can be a disguise for fear.

107
00:12:53,478 --> 00:12:56,231
Mr. Middleton, I fought
with Captain Martin...

108
00:12:56,438 --> 00:12:59,077
...under Washington
in the French and Indian War.

109
00:12:59,678 --> 00:13:01,191
There's not a man in this room...

110
00:13:01,398 --> 00:13:05,437
...or anywhere for that matter, to whom
I would more willingly trust my life.

111
00:13:06,398 --> 00:13:08,514
There are alternatives to war.

112
00:13:09,758 --> 00:13:11,635
We take our case before the king.

113
00:13:11,838 --> 00:13:13,237
- We plead with him.
- We tried.

114
00:13:13,438 --> 00:13:16,794
Well, then, we try again and again
if necessary to avoid a war.

115
00:13:17,798 --> 00:13:19,709
I was at Bunker Hill.

116
00:13:20,518 --> 00:13:22,509
The British advanced three times.

117
00:13:22,758 --> 00:13:26,592
We killed 700 at point-blank range
and still they took the ground.

118
00:13:27,078 --> 00:13:29,751
That is the measure of their resolve.

119
00:13:30,718 --> 00:13:32,948
If your principles dictate
independence...

120
00:13:33,158 --> 00:13:35,353
...then war is the only way.

121
00:13:35,838 --> 00:13:37,351
It is come to that.

122
00:13:37,558 --> 00:13:38,991
Hear, hear.

123
00:13:41,118 --> 00:13:42,870
I have seven children.

124
00:13:43,558 --> 00:13:45,071
My wife is dead.

125
00:13:46,758 --> 00:13:48,908
Now, who's to care for them
if I go to war?

126
00:13:51,318 --> 00:13:54,469
Wars are not fought
only by childless men.

127
00:13:55,038 --> 00:13:56,266
Granted.

128
00:13:59,038 --> 00:14:00,915
But mark my words.

129
00:14:03,158 --> 00:14:06,833
This war will be fought,
not on the frontier...

130
00:14:07,038 --> 00:14:09,711
...or on some distant battlefield...

131
00:14:10,718 --> 00:14:12,276
...but amongst us.

132
00:14:12,478 --> 00:14:14,355
Among our homes.

133
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:18,350
Our children will learn of it
with their own eyes.

134
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:23,997
And the innocent will die
with the rest of us.

135
00:14:27,838 --> 00:14:29,351
I will not fight.

136
00:14:30,358 --> 00:14:33,031
And because I will not fight,
I will not cast a vote...

137
00:14:33,238 --> 00:14:35,877
...that will send others to fight
in my stead.

138
00:14:38,118 --> 00:14:39,949
And your principles?

139
00:14:43,318 --> 00:14:46,390
I'm a parent. I haven't got
the luxury of principles.

140
00:14:54,998 --> 00:14:56,750
We must vote to levy!

141
00:15:10,678 --> 00:15:13,067
28 to 12! The levy passed!

142
00:15:41,918 --> 00:15:43,829
You intend to enlist
without my permission?

143
00:15:44,398 --> 00:15:45,797
Yes, I do.

144
00:15:51,278 --> 00:15:55,032
Father, I thought you were
a man of principle.

145
00:15:58,878 --> 00:16:02,075
When you have a family of your own,
perhaps you'll understand.

146
00:16:04,598 --> 00:16:07,670
When I have a family of my own,
I won't hide behind them.

147
00:16:23,238 --> 00:16:26,947
He's as imprudent as his father was
at his age.

148
00:16:27,318 --> 00:16:28,876
Regrettably so.

149
00:16:30,758 --> 00:16:33,192
I'll see to it that he
serves under me.

150
00:16:34,198 --> 00:16:38,191
Make him a clerk or quartermaster,
something of that sort.

151
00:16:40,598 --> 00:16:42,077
Good luck.

152
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:08,313
Dear Thomas:
Though many seasons have passed...

153
00:17:08,518 --> 00:17:12,591
...it seems like only yesterday when
we last saw each other in Charles Town.

154
00:17:13,238 --> 00:17:16,230
With sadness, I learned
of its recent fall to the British...

155
00:17:16,438 --> 00:17:18,190
...under General Cornwallis.

156
00:17:22,198 --> 00:17:23,950
I received a letter
from Aunt Charlotte...

157
00:17:24,158 --> 00:17:27,070
...saying she closed her home
in Charles Town after the city fell...

158
00:17:27,598 --> 00:17:30,396
...and moved to her plantation
on the Santee.

159
00:17:40,278 --> 00:17:44,749
Here in the north, our campaign has
been marked by defeat and privation.

160
00:17:46,358 --> 00:17:48,428
Our losses have been grievous.

161
00:17:54,438 --> 00:17:58,511
My good friend, Peter Cuppin,
fell at E lizabethtown.

162
00:18:05,158 --> 00:18:07,592
His death has been difficult to bear.

163
00:18:20,038 --> 00:18:22,347
We will march south
with General Gates...

164
00:18:22,558 --> 00:18:25,231
...to fight the Redcoats
under Cornwallis.

165
00:18:28,238 --> 00:18:29,227
Thank you, sir.

166
00:18:33,558 --> 00:18:35,310
Easy, Red. Easy.

167
00:18:42,518 --> 00:18:44,031
I envy you...

168
00:18:44,238 --> 00:18:48,550
...your youth and distance from this
cruel conflict of which I am a part.

169
00:18:49,918 --> 00:18:52,591
'But I am fortunate to be
serving the cause of Liberty.

170
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:55,869
And though I fear death...

171
00:18:56,118 --> 00:18:58,678
...each day in prayer I reaffirm
my willingness...

172
00:18:58,878 --> 00:19:01,108
...to give my life in its service.

173
00:19:02,158 --> 00:19:03,113
Pray for me.

174
00:19:04,598 --> 00:19:06,873
But above all, pray for the cause.

175
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:09,755
Your loving brother, Gabriel.'

176
00:19:44,598 --> 00:19:45,553
What are you doing?

177
00:19:52,038 --> 00:19:53,266
Turn around.

178
00:19:58,078 --> 00:19:59,989
Not yet, Thomas.

179
00:20:00,438 --> 00:20:01,393
When?

180
00:20:06,358 --> 00:20:07,313
Seventeen.

181
00:20:08,838 --> 00:20:11,477
That's two years.
It's already been two.

182
00:20:11,718 --> 00:20:14,596
- The war could be over by then.
- God willing.

183
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:21,278
All right. Seventeen.

184
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:25,747
All right.

185
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:34,391
Put it back, please.

186
00:20:38,398 --> 00:20:39,797
Father?

187
00:20:41,158 --> 00:20:43,228
What happened at Fort Wilderness?

188
00:20:46,358 --> 00:20:47,552
Put it away.

189
00:21:14,918 --> 00:21:16,351
Six-pounders.

190
00:21:16,838 --> 00:21:17,827
Lots of them.

191
00:21:18,718 --> 00:21:19,992
How far away?

192
00:21:20,918 --> 00:21:24,706
They're a long way off. They're most
likely heading the other direction.

193
00:21:26,438 --> 00:21:27,951
Put those in the house.

194
00:21:28,438 --> 00:21:30,793
- They might come this way.
- Must I tell you again?

195
00:21:34,158 --> 00:21:36,911
Let's all stay close in to the house,
all right?

196
00:21:56,278 --> 00:21:57,597
We'll have to fight them off.

197
00:21:58,118 --> 00:21:59,597
Won't Father do that?

198
00:22:00,598 --> 00:22:02,873
They'll probably kill us men...

199
00:22:04,678 --> 00:22:06,748
...and do Lord-knows-what
to you women.

200
00:22:06,998 --> 00:22:08,477
Nathan!

201
00:22:33,998 --> 00:22:35,226
Slowly turn.

202
00:22:38,838 --> 00:22:39,827
Father.

203
00:22:42,998 --> 00:22:44,226
Abigale!

204
00:22:44,998 --> 00:22:46,511
Water and bandages, fast.

205
00:22:51,158 --> 00:22:52,830
The battle. Were you there?

206
00:22:53,438 --> 00:22:54,996
Have you seen any Redcoats?

207
00:22:55,198 --> 00:22:56,677
No, not yet.

208
00:22:57,118 --> 00:22:59,348
Abigale, the children, please.

209
00:22:59,598 --> 00:23:01,873
Children, come. Upstairs.

210
00:23:07,438 --> 00:23:09,713
Gates marched us straight
at the Redcoats.

211
00:23:09,918 --> 00:23:13,513
Our lines broke. The British
Green Dragoons cut us to bits.

212
00:23:13,758 --> 00:23:15,874
I was given these dispatches.

213
00:23:16,278 --> 00:23:19,907
As I left, I saw
the Virginia Regulars surrender.

214
00:23:22,998 --> 00:23:24,795
The Dragoons rode into them.

215
00:23:26,518 --> 00:23:27,473
Killed them all.

216
00:23:28,758 --> 00:23:30,350
Over 200 men.

217
00:23:31,758 --> 00:23:33,237
I have to get these dispatches
to Hillsborough.

218
00:23:33,478 --> 00:23:34,593
You can't ride.

219
00:23:34,838 --> 00:23:37,147
I can't stay here!
Lt's not safe for...

220
00:24:08,958 --> 00:24:10,357
Fire!

221
00:24:18,358 --> 00:24:19,791
Fire!

222
00:25:55,238 --> 00:25:57,706
Thank you for the care
of His Majesty's soldiers.

223
00:26:27,518 --> 00:26:30,430
Have a detachment take our
wounded to our surgeons at Winnsboro.

224
00:26:30,918 --> 00:26:31,987
Yes, sir.

225
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:34,907
Fire the house and barns.

226
00:26:37,238 --> 00:26:40,275
Let it be known if you harbor
the enemy you will lose your home.

227
00:26:44,198 --> 00:26:45,995
By order of King George...

228
00:26:46,198 --> 00:26:49,508
...all slaves of the American colonies
who fight for the Crown...

229
00:26:49,758 --> 00:26:52,989
...will be granted their freedom
with our victory.

230
00:26:54,878 --> 00:26:58,314
We're not slaves. We work this land.
We're freedmen.

231
00:26:58,518 --> 00:27:01,476
Then you're freedmen who will have
the privilege...

232
00:27:01,718 --> 00:27:03,788
...of fighting in the king's army.

233
00:27:09,478 --> 00:27:11,230
Rebel dispatches, sir.

234
00:27:17,398 --> 00:27:18,717
Who carried this?

235
00:27:27,598 --> 00:27:28,667
Who carried this?!

236
00:27:29,678 --> 00:27:30,588
I did, sir.

237
00:27:37,158 --> 00:27:39,069
I was wounded.
These people gave me care.

238
00:27:40,078 --> 00:27:41,557
They have nothing to do
with the dispatches.

239
00:27:45,158 --> 00:27:46,989
Take this one to Camden.
He is a spy.

240
00:27:47,198 --> 00:27:49,234
Hang him, put his body on display.

241
00:27:49,758 --> 00:27:51,555
He's a dispatch rider.

242
00:27:51,758 --> 00:27:54,318
Destroy the livestock.
Save the horses for the Dragoons.

243
00:27:55,038 --> 00:27:58,713
Colonel, this is a uniformed
dispatch rider carrying a marked case.

244
00:27:58,918 --> 00:28:00,192
He cannot be held as a spy.

245
00:28:00,398 --> 00:28:02,992
Well, we won't hold him.
We're going to hang him.

246
00:28:06,438 --> 00:28:07,917
- Colonel...
- Father!

247
00:28:11,198 --> 00:28:14,031
Oh, I see. He's your son.

248
00:28:14,998 --> 00:28:17,751
Perhaps you should've taught him
something of loyalty.

249
00:28:19,038 --> 00:28:23,077
Colonel, I beg you, please reconsider.
By the rules of war...

250
00:28:23,278 --> 00:28:26,714
Would you like a lesson, sir,
in the rules of war?

251
00:28:29,678 --> 00:28:31,157
Or perhaps your children would.

252
00:28:36,078 --> 00:28:37,557
No lesson is necessary.

253
00:28:40,598 --> 00:28:41,553
Sir.

254
00:28:41,798 --> 00:28:43,675
What of the rebel wounded?

255
00:28:45,918 --> 00:28:47,146
Kill them.

256
00:28:51,878 --> 00:28:52,947
Father.

257
00:28:56,958 --> 00:28:58,676
Father, do something!

258
00:28:58,878 --> 00:28:59,867
Be quiet!

259
00:29:12,118 --> 00:29:13,915
Gabriel, run!

260
00:29:14,998 --> 00:29:15,987
Wait!

261
00:29:18,758 --> 00:29:19,793
No!!

262
00:29:45,198 --> 00:29:46,995
Stupid boy.

263
00:29:52,758 --> 00:29:53,952
Captain.

264
00:30:53,358 --> 00:30:54,711
Come, child.

265
00:30:56,438 --> 00:30:58,793
I'm not leaving these children!

266
00:30:58,998 --> 00:31:00,317
Mercy!

267
00:31:01,558 --> 00:31:02,991
Get ready!

268
00:31:03,198 --> 00:31:04,108
Present!

269
00:31:04,318 --> 00:31:05,387
Fire!

270
00:31:47,758 --> 00:31:49,111
All of you, stay here.

271
00:32:23,078 --> 00:32:24,477
Nathan, Samuel.

272
00:32:29,078 --> 00:32:30,227
Margaret.

273
00:32:32,598 --> 00:32:35,032
Hide in the fields
with William and Susan.

274
00:32:35,238 --> 00:32:37,832
If we're not back by sunset,
take them to Aunt Charlotte's.

275
00:32:38,038 --> 00:32:39,232
Is that clear?

276
00:32:40,998 --> 00:32:42,067
Boys.

277
00:33:33,238 --> 00:33:34,466
It's a good spot.

278
00:33:35,798 --> 00:33:37,868
Boys, listen to me.

279
00:33:38,318 --> 00:33:39,956
I'll fire first.

280
00:33:41,958 --> 00:33:44,756
Start with the officers
and work your way down.

281
00:33:44,958 --> 00:33:46,596
Can you tell the difference?

282
00:33:46,838 --> 00:33:47,793
Yes, Father.

283
00:33:47,998 --> 00:33:49,750
- Yes, Father.
- Good.

284
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:52,746
Samuel, after your first shot,
reload for Nathan.

285
00:33:53,878 --> 00:33:54,833
Now...

286
00:33:55,038 --> 00:33:57,677
...if anything should happen to me,
drop your weapons.

287
00:33:57,878 --> 00:33:59,470
Run as quickly as you can.

288
00:33:59,678 --> 00:34:02,033
Get your brother and your sisters...

289
00:34:02,238 --> 00:34:04,877
...and take them to
Aunt Charlotte's. Understood?

290
00:34:06,358 --> 00:34:07,916
What did I say about shooting?

291
00:34:08,438 --> 00:34:09,666
Aim small, miss small.

292
00:34:10,118 --> 00:34:11,756
Aim small, miss small.

293
00:34:12,918 --> 00:34:14,033
Boys...

294
00:34:14,518 --> 00:34:15,792
...Samuel...

295
00:34:16,158 --> 00:34:17,432
...steady.

296
00:35:03,038 --> 00:35:05,393
Lord, make me fast and accurate.

297
00:35:06,878 --> 00:35:09,187
Aim small, miss small.

298
00:35:09,398 --> 00:35:12,037
Aim small, miss small.

299
00:35:12,278 --> 00:35:14,872
Aim small, miss small.

300
00:35:28,078 --> 00:35:29,716
- On the right!
- To the left!

301
00:35:35,558 --> 00:35:37,549
Behind us! Up on the ridge!

302
00:35:41,878 --> 00:35:43,152
Form right!

303
00:35:45,078 --> 00:35:46,033
To the right!

304
00:35:48,038 --> 00:35:49,232
About face!

305
00:35:52,118 --> 00:35:53,551
On the right to the rear!

306
00:35:54,838 --> 00:35:55,668
To the right!

307
00:35:56,438 --> 00:35:57,393
Fire!

308
00:35:58,678 --> 00:36:00,748
- Reload!
- Reload!

309
00:36:19,078 --> 00:36:20,397
Behind you!

310
00:36:25,078 --> 00:36:26,716
Look on the rear!

311
00:39:37,038 --> 00:39:39,552
We have the private
the Cherokee scouts brought in.

312
00:39:41,558 --> 00:39:42,786
Private?

313
00:39:43,038 --> 00:39:44,027
Private.

314
00:39:44,238 --> 00:39:46,149
Colonel William Tavington,
Green Dragoons.

315
00:39:46,998 --> 00:39:49,193
What happened? Who did this?

316
00:39:50,078 --> 00:39:51,147
Him.

317
00:39:52,438 --> 00:39:53,757
It was mad.

318
00:39:54,598 --> 00:39:56,156
I couldn't tell you who it was.

319
00:39:56,398 --> 00:39:58,389
Calm down. Calm down, man.

320
00:39:58,998 --> 00:40:01,717
Twenty of His Majesty's soldiers
are dead.

321
00:40:01,918 --> 00:40:04,227
And I need to know how.

322
00:40:04,438 --> 00:40:06,588
- He said there was...
- Were you there?

323
00:40:06,958 --> 00:40:08,949
Then let him speak.

324
00:40:09,558 --> 00:40:12,789
Take your time and tell me.
How many were there?

325
00:40:12,998 --> 00:40:14,829
Were they militia?
Were they Regulars?

326
00:40:15,318 --> 00:40:17,548
I don't really remember how many.

327
00:40:19,878 --> 00:40:20,947
Maybe one.

328
00:40:23,078 --> 00:40:25,467
One man. Really?

329
00:40:25,758 --> 00:40:27,396
He was in the flank.

330
00:40:28,838 --> 00:40:30,430
All around us.

331
00:40:30,758 --> 00:40:32,191
Amongst us.

332
00:40:32,918 --> 00:40:35,193
I could barely see him.
He was there, then he was gone.

333
00:40:35,398 --> 00:40:37,036
He just vanished.

334
00:40:38,158 --> 00:40:40,547
Sounds more like a ghost than a man.

335
00:40:40,798 --> 00:40:42,277
A ghost.

336
00:40:43,678 --> 00:40:45,316
He was like a ghost.

337
00:40:46,838 --> 00:40:48,112
Enough.

338
00:40:50,158 --> 00:40:52,752
Bordon? Take a patrol.

339
00:40:52,958 --> 00:40:55,791
Capture this ghost before
word of his exploits spread.

340
00:40:55,998 --> 00:40:58,796
- Who's this?
- Sir, this is Captain Wilkins.

341
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:02,354
He was with the Loyalist Colonial
Militia. He might be of use.

342
00:41:02,838 --> 00:41:04,590
Another colonial.

343
00:41:05,038 --> 00:41:07,427
Captain Wilkins,
where do your loyalties lie?

344
00:41:07,678 --> 00:41:08,713
To king and country.

345
00:41:09,118 --> 00:41:11,427
Why should I trust a man who'd
betray his neighbors?

346
00:41:12,198 --> 00:41:15,110
Those neighbors of mine who stand
against England...

347
00:41:15,318 --> 00:41:16,910
...deserve to die a traitor's death.

348
00:41:18,078 --> 00:41:18,988
We'll see.

349
00:41:25,118 --> 00:41:26,551
Mr. Martin!

350
00:41:32,598 --> 00:41:34,190
Miss Charlotte!

351
00:41:45,318 --> 00:41:47,991
You're safe now. Try to sleep.

352
00:41:48,198 --> 00:41:49,517
Good night.

353
00:41:49,758 --> 00:41:50,827
Good night.

354
00:41:51,478 --> 00:41:52,706
Father?

355
00:41:52,918 --> 00:41:54,112
Yes.

356
00:41:55,038 --> 00:41:57,108
I killed those men.

357
00:41:58,278 --> 00:41:59,677
You did what I told you to do.

358
00:42:01,078 --> 00:42:04,070
You did what you had to.
There was no wrong in it.

359
00:42:06,478 --> 00:42:08,514
I'm glad I killed them.

360
00:42:11,918 --> 00:42:13,476
I'm glad.

361
00:42:22,838 --> 00:42:24,271
Get some rest.

362
00:42:52,798 --> 00:42:55,995
You've done nothing for which
you should be ashamed.

363
00:42:57,798 --> 00:42:59,311
I've done nothing.

364
00:43:01,038 --> 00:43:03,029
And for that, I am ashamed.

365
00:43:20,678 --> 00:43:23,238
Gates and the Continental Army
are at Hillsborough.

366
00:43:23,718 --> 00:43:24,912
I'm joining up with them.

367
00:43:30,078 --> 00:43:32,034
No. Your place is here now.

368
00:43:32,238 --> 00:43:34,308
I'm going back.
I'm a soldier, it's my duty.

369
00:43:35,198 --> 00:43:37,109
Your duty is to your family.

370
00:43:38,758 --> 00:43:40,555
Don't you walk away from me, boy!

371
00:43:40,838 --> 00:43:42,032
I'll find you when it's over.

372
00:43:42,238 --> 00:43:43,956
No, I forbid you to go!

373
00:43:44,158 --> 00:43:46,547
- I'm not a child!
- You're my child!

374
00:43:49,438 --> 00:43:50,473
Goodbye, Father.

375
00:43:53,958 --> 00:43:55,516
Thomas is dead.

376
00:43:56,198 --> 00:43:58,837
How many more have to die
before you'll heed my word?

377
00:44:27,678 --> 00:44:29,589
I'm losing my family.

378
00:44:33,238 --> 00:44:35,229
When will you be back, Father?

379
00:44:36,158 --> 00:44:37,432
I don't know.

380
00:44:37,878 --> 00:44:39,152
Tomorrow?

381
00:44:39,518 --> 00:44:41,270
No, not tomorrow.

382
00:44:41,718 --> 00:44:43,390
You say your prayers.

383
00:44:43,598 --> 00:44:44,747
I will.

384
00:44:45,438 --> 00:44:48,908
Take care of your brothers and sisters
and your Aunt Charlotte.

385
00:44:49,278 --> 00:44:50,916
I'm depending on you.

386
00:44:51,878 --> 00:44:53,675
As I am on you, Samuel.

387
00:44:55,118 --> 00:44:56,187
All right.

388
00:45:02,798 --> 00:45:04,026
Susan...

389
00:45:06,238 --> 00:45:07,387
...goodbye.

390
00:45:21,678 --> 00:45:22,872
Thank you.

391
00:47:25,718 --> 00:47:27,071
Halt!

392
00:47:31,238 --> 00:47:32,717
Make ready!

393
00:47:37,358 --> 00:47:38,871
Take aim!

394
00:47:43,238 --> 00:47:44,432
Fire!

395
00:47:55,998 --> 00:47:57,670
I'm not going back.

396
00:47:58,318 --> 00:48:00,434
No, I didn't expect you would.

397
00:48:04,838 --> 00:48:07,068
That Gates is a damn fool.

398
00:48:08,918 --> 00:48:11,148
He spent too many years
in the British army.

399
00:48:11,438 --> 00:48:15,317
Going muzzle-to-muzzle with Redcoats
in open field. It's madness.

400
00:48:15,998 --> 00:48:17,067
Halt!

401
00:48:17,478 --> 00:48:19,196
Make ready!

402
00:48:19,758 --> 00:48:21,476
Present!

403
00:48:22,478 --> 00:48:23,672
Fire!

404
00:48:45,518 --> 00:48:48,032
This battle was over before it began.

405
00:48:57,318 --> 00:48:58,512
Retreat!

406
00:48:59,158 --> 00:49:00,910
Retreat!

407
00:49:07,678 --> 00:49:10,192
These rustics are so inept.

408
00:49:10,518 --> 00:49:12,952
Nearly takes the honor out of victory.

409
00:49:13,758 --> 00:49:14,907
Nearly.

410
00:49:20,198 --> 00:49:21,267
Hold him firm.

411
00:49:38,718 --> 00:49:41,676
- Where's your commanding officer?
- That tent there.

412
00:49:47,998 --> 00:49:49,750
It's a lost cause.

413
00:50:05,838 --> 00:50:07,317
Benjamin Martin.

414
00:50:07,518 --> 00:50:09,395
I'm in no mood for a lecture.

415
00:50:09,758 --> 00:50:11,953
Where's your General Gates now?

416
00:50:12,318 --> 00:50:16,277
The last anyone saw,
riding hard northeast...

417
00:50:16,518 --> 00:50:19,316
...his staff 100 yards behind,
trying to catch up.

418
00:50:20,158 --> 00:50:21,830
So who's in command?

419
00:50:22,358 --> 00:50:23,677
I am.

420
00:50:24,558 --> 00:50:25,911
I think.

421
00:50:27,038 --> 00:50:28,357
What are my orders?

422
00:50:33,078 --> 00:50:36,150
We're a breath away from losing
this war, Benjamin.

423
00:50:38,838 --> 00:50:41,750
In the north, Washington is
reeling from Morristown.

424
00:50:41,958 --> 00:50:44,518
He's running and hiding
from 12,000 Redcoats.

425
00:50:44,758 --> 00:50:47,192
In the south, Cornwallis has
broken our back.

426
00:50:47,398 --> 00:50:50,515
Captured over 5000 of our troops
when he took Charles Town.

427
00:50:50,758 --> 00:50:53,750
And he destroyed the only army
between him and New York.

428
00:50:55,398 --> 00:50:58,708
Nothing will stop him from
heading north to finish off Washington.

429
00:50:58,918 --> 00:51:02,706
Unless we can keep Cornwallis
in the south till the French arrive.

430
00:51:03,718 --> 00:51:06,471
They've promised a fleet
and 10,000 troops.

431
00:51:06,718 --> 00:51:07,673
When?

432
00:51:09,278 --> 00:51:11,587
Six months at the earliest.

433
00:51:11,838 --> 00:51:14,068
You trust the French
to keep their word?

434
00:51:14,278 --> 00:51:15,677
Absolument.

435
00:51:17,798 --> 00:51:20,392
Benjamin Martin.
Major Jean Villeneuve.

436
00:51:20,598 --> 00:51:23,158
French Seventh Light Foot.
He will help train the militia.

437
00:51:24,038 --> 00:51:27,189
The hero of Fort Wilderness.
Your reputation precedes you.

438
00:51:31,878 --> 00:51:34,915
You really expect to hold Cornwallis
here using just militia?

439
00:51:35,118 --> 00:51:37,268
Not me. You.

440
00:51:39,478 --> 00:51:41,594
They're not soldiers,
they're farmers.

441
00:51:41,838 --> 00:51:44,068
They'd be better off letting
the British march through.

442
00:51:44,278 --> 00:51:46,872
They'd be better off,
but the cause wouldn't.

443
00:51:47,878 --> 00:51:49,834
How many men does Cornwallis have?

444
00:51:50,198 --> 00:51:52,189
8000 infantry.

445
00:51:52,398 --> 00:51:54,707
Around 600 cavalry.

446
00:51:54,918 --> 00:51:57,386
I'm giving you a field commission
as a colonel.

447
00:51:57,798 --> 00:52:00,517
Might I request that you transfer
my son under my command?

448
00:52:00,718 --> 00:52:01,992
Sir, no, I...

449
00:52:02,198 --> 00:52:03,472
That's done.

450
00:52:06,838 --> 00:52:07,907
Thank you.

451
00:52:09,878 --> 00:52:11,709
Colonel, I've been a soldier
for two years.

452
00:52:11,918 --> 00:52:14,273
As a scout, horseman,
marksman, scavenger.

453
00:52:14,478 --> 00:52:16,912
- Is that so?
- L'd be of better use with Regulars.

454
00:52:17,118 --> 00:52:19,154
Where'd you learn all that
riding, shooting, scavenging?

455
00:52:19,358 --> 00:52:20,950
My father taught me.

456
00:52:22,878 --> 00:52:24,391
Teach you any humility?

457
00:52:25,038 --> 00:52:26,710
He tried. It didn't take.

458
00:52:27,998 --> 00:52:31,468
He also taught you every trail
between here and Charles Town...

459
00:52:31,678 --> 00:52:33,350
...which is why he transferred you.

460
00:52:33,998 --> 00:52:36,512
We'll put the word out.
Start on the south side of...

461
00:52:36,758 --> 00:52:38,874
We'll cover more ground
if we split up.

462
00:52:42,318 --> 00:52:45,708
Very well, corporal. You take
Harrisville, Pembroke, Wakefield.

463
00:52:45,918 --> 00:52:49,911
I'll start on the north side.
Meet at the mission in Black Swamp.

464
00:52:53,758 --> 00:52:54,827
Corporal.

465
00:52:56,478 --> 00:52:57,911
Be careful.

466
00:53:00,118 --> 00:53:01,267
Yes, sir.

467
00:53:05,998 --> 00:53:07,431
You have children?

468
00:53:11,958 --> 00:53:13,277
French.

469
00:53:36,398 --> 00:53:38,150
It skirts the mountain and then...

470
00:53:38,358 --> 00:53:40,588
...extends down towards
the headwater here...

471
00:53:40,838 --> 00:53:44,228
...and right across to the far bank
of the Ohio River.

472
00:53:44,678 --> 00:53:45,827
It's 100,000 acres.

473
00:53:46,038 --> 00:53:48,233
It's an imposing land grant, my lord.

474
00:53:48,438 --> 00:53:50,998
You will be a country unto yourself.

475
00:53:54,558 --> 00:53:56,196
His Majesty is most generous.

476
00:53:58,878 --> 00:54:02,666
Though your service in this war
more than warrants such a gift.

477
00:54:03,478 --> 00:54:08,029
Yes, this is how His Majesty
rewards those...

478
00:54:08,238 --> 00:54:10,229
...who fight for him as gentlemen.

479
00:54:10,478 --> 00:54:14,357
I dare to presume my own meager
contributions will be rewarded one day.

480
00:54:14,558 --> 00:54:16,549
You may presume too much.

481
00:54:17,198 --> 00:54:20,588
His Majesty, like history,
judges us by the outcome of the war...

482
00:54:20,838 --> 00:54:22,829
...and the manner in which
it was fought.

483
00:54:23,838 --> 00:54:26,716
We serve the Crown, and we must
conduct ourselves accordingly.

484
00:54:27,718 --> 00:54:29,515
Surrendering troops
will be given quarter.

485
00:54:29,878 --> 00:54:31,948
These brutal tactics must stop!

486
00:54:32,758 --> 00:54:34,908
Is it not enough that I have
never lost a battle?

487
00:54:35,118 --> 00:54:36,233
You serve me...

488
00:54:36,438 --> 00:54:40,590
...and the manner in which
you serve me reflects upon me!

489
00:54:41,798 --> 00:54:45,029
I would've thought that a gentleman
from a family as esteemed as yours...

490
00:54:45,238 --> 00:54:46,717
...would understand that.

491
00:54:48,678 --> 00:54:51,272
My late father squandered any esteem
in which we were held...

492
00:54:51,478 --> 00:54:53,275
...along with my inheritance.

493
00:54:56,598 --> 00:54:59,112
I advance myself only through victory.

494
00:54:59,318 --> 00:55:02,515
You advance yourself
only through my good graces.

495
00:55:04,158 --> 00:55:06,149
These Colonials are our brethren.

496
00:55:06,358 --> 00:55:10,954
And when this conflict is over,
we will reestablish commerce with them.

497
00:55:11,438 --> 00:55:13,269
Do you understand, colonel?

498
00:55:14,518 --> 00:55:16,156
Perfectly, my lord.

499
00:55:57,558 --> 00:56:00,277
Reverend, with your permission,
l'd like to make an announcement.

500
00:56:00,718 --> 00:56:03,471
Young man, this is a house of God.

501
00:56:04,078 --> 00:56:06,717
I understand that, reverend.
I apologize.

502
00:56:08,278 --> 00:56:11,270
The South Carolina Militia is
being called up.

503
00:56:11,598 --> 00:56:13,395
I'm here to enlist every man willing.

504
00:56:14,758 --> 00:56:15,747
Son...

505
00:56:16,238 --> 00:56:17,990
...we are here to pray...

506
00:56:18,198 --> 00:56:20,917
...for the souls of those men
hanging outside.

507
00:56:21,118 --> 00:56:22,915
Yes, pray for them.

508
00:56:23,158 --> 00:56:25,353
But honor them by
taking up arms with us.

509
00:56:27,118 --> 00:56:29,074
And bring more suffering to this town?

510
00:56:29,438 --> 00:56:32,953
If King George can hang those men,
he can hang any one of us.

511
00:56:34,918 --> 00:56:36,033
Dan Scott...

512
00:56:36,238 --> 00:56:39,674
...barely a week ago you railed
for two hours about independence.

513
00:56:42,278 --> 00:56:44,746
Mr. Hardwick, how many times
have I heard you...

514
00:56:44,958 --> 00:56:47,392
...speak of freedom
at my father's table?

515
00:56:48,878 --> 00:56:52,075
Half the men in this church,
including you, Father...

516
00:56:53,278 --> 00:56:54,996
...and you, reverend...

517
00:56:55,438 --> 00:56:58,271
...are as ardent patriots as I.

518
00:57:02,758 --> 00:57:07,070
Will you now, when you are needed most,
stop at only words?

519
00:57:07,518 --> 00:57:09,270
Is that the sort of men you are?

520
00:57:18,478 --> 00:57:20,673
I ask only that you act
upon the beliefs...

521
00:57:20,878 --> 00:57:23,711
...of which you have
so strongly spoken...

522
00:57:24,478 --> 00:57:27,436
...and in which you
so strongly believe.

523
00:57:39,158 --> 00:57:40,511
Who's with us?

524
00:58:39,838 --> 00:58:40,748
Mr. Howard.

525
00:58:41,958 --> 00:58:42,947
Sir...

526
00:58:43,398 --> 00:58:45,548
...may I have permission to
write to Anne?

527
00:58:49,198 --> 00:58:52,235
- May I have permission to write Anne?
- Yes.

528
00:58:53,198 --> 00:58:54,711
You have permission...

529
00:58:54,998 --> 00:58:56,875
...to write me.

530
00:58:57,318 --> 00:58:59,149
Oh, write her.

531
00:59:00,558 --> 00:59:01,832
Very well.

532
00:59:03,798 --> 00:59:04,913
Thank you, sir.

533
00:59:07,358 --> 00:59:08,586
Reverend?

534
00:59:15,158 --> 00:59:17,194
A shepherd must tend his flock.

535
00:59:18,438 --> 00:59:21,748
And, at times, fight off the wolves.

536
00:59:58,838 --> 01:00:01,989
Are you sure this is the right place
to recruit for a militia?

537
01:00:09,078 --> 01:00:10,670
God save King George!

538
01:00:29,518 --> 01:00:31,429
I think we came to the right place.

539
01:00:37,838 --> 01:00:40,511
- Any bounty?
- No scalp money this time, Rollins.

540
01:00:40,758 --> 01:00:44,831
But you can keep or sell me the muskets
and gear of any Redcoat you kill.

541
01:00:56,398 --> 01:00:58,832
They hanged my brother
down in Acworth.

542
01:00:59,678 --> 01:01:02,146
Every damned one of them Redcoats
deserves to die.

543
01:01:02,358 --> 01:01:03,871
- Sign up.
- With all my ailments...

544
01:01:04,078 --> 01:01:06,956
...I wouldn't make it through
the first skirmish. No, sir.

545
01:01:07,158 --> 01:01:09,956
But you can have my Negro.
He'll fight in my stead.

546
01:01:10,158 --> 01:01:11,716
Occam! Get over here.

547
01:01:12,998 --> 01:01:16,388
Ain't overly smart.
He's strong as a bull.

548
01:01:16,758 --> 01:01:17,713
Can you write?

549
01:01:18,678 --> 01:01:20,350
No, no, sir.

550
01:01:20,598 --> 01:01:22,190
- Well, then, make your mark.
- Why?

551
01:01:22,718 --> 01:01:24,310
I just signed him over to you.

552
01:01:24,518 --> 01:01:26,588
If you're willing,
make your mark.

553
01:01:33,158 --> 01:01:34,113
That'll do.

554
01:01:39,398 --> 01:01:40,877
I'll kill me some Redcoats.

555
01:01:41,758 --> 01:01:43,032
I believe you would.

556
01:01:43,398 --> 01:01:44,513
How old are you?

557
01:01:44,758 --> 01:01:47,226
Not quite old enough.
But his time will come.

558
01:01:47,438 --> 01:01:49,827
John Billings.
I was hoping you'd turn up.

559
01:01:50,038 --> 01:01:52,427
There's a story going around
about 20 Redcoats...

560
01:01:52,678 --> 01:01:55,192
...got killed by a ghost
or some damn thing.

561
01:01:55,398 --> 01:01:57,036
Carried a Cherokee tomahawk.

562
01:01:58,998 --> 01:02:01,910
Aren't you a little old to be
believing in ghost stories?

563
01:03:05,398 --> 01:03:06,956
How many did you get?

564
01:03:07,478 --> 01:03:08,433
Twelve.

565
01:03:09,198 --> 01:03:10,153
Good.

566
01:03:11,158 --> 01:03:13,877
These men,
they're not the sort we need.

567
01:03:17,038 --> 01:03:19,074
They're exactly the sort we need.

568
01:03:20,238 --> 01:03:22,274
They've fought
this kind of war before.

569
01:03:25,838 --> 01:03:27,749
What about me? Am I one of that sort?

570
01:03:28,238 --> 01:03:29,466
Hell, no.

571
01:03:29,958 --> 01:03:31,949
Your sort gives that sort a bad name.

572
01:03:37,438 --> 01:03:40,589
I want accuracy and precision.

573
01:03:41,038 --> 01:03:42,153
Make ready!

574
01:03:46,798 --> 01:03:48,197
Take aim!

575
01:03:53,158 --> 01:03:54,432
Fire!

576
01:04:31,758 --> 01:04:33,555
Dear Anne:

577
01:04:33,798 --> 01:04:35,754
Our force continues to grow.

578
01:04:35,958 --> 01:04:40,236
As long as we continue to fight,
others will come to fight beside us.

579
01:04:40,438 --> 01:04:43,350
I long to see you and speak to you.

580
01:04:43,558 --> 01:04:46,026
I'm hopeful that our duties
will bring me near you.

581
01:04:46,238 --> 01:04:50,356
Until then, I am and will remain
most affectionately yours.

582
01:04:50,558 --> 01:04:51,547
Gabriel.

583
01:05:16,838 --> 01:05:18,317
We surrender!

584
01:05:20,438 --> 01:05:21,757
No! God, stop!

585
01:05:21,958 --> 01:05:23,357
For the love of God, we...

586
01:05:24,518 --> 01:05:26,110
These men were about to surrender!

587
01:05:28,038 --> 01:05:29,312
Perhaps.

588
01:05:29,518 --> 01:05:30,553
We will never know.

589
01:05:30,998 --> 01:05:31,987
This is murder!

590
01:05:32,558 --> 01:05:35,516
Hell, reverend, they're Redcoats.
They've earned it.

591
01:05:38,238 --> 01:05:40,547
- We're better than that.
- What do you know about war?

592
01:05:40,798 --> 01:05:42,516
I know the difference
between fighting...

593
01:05:42,758 --> 01:05:44,350
Go back to church!

594
01:05:44,558 --> 01:05:45,752
Quiet!

595
01:05:47,518 --> 01:05:48,792
He's right.

596
01:05:49,678 --> 01:05:52,988
Quarter will be given to British
wounded and any who surrender.

597
01:05:53,198 --> 01:05:56,747
They gave no quarter when they fired on
a ship carrying my wife and daughters.

598
01:05:57,758 --> 01:06:00,955
I watched from 200 yards off
as they were burned alive.

599
01:06:01,918 --> 01:06:04,352
- All my sympathy, but my order stands.
- Damn your sympathy.

600
01:06:05,158 --> 01:06:07,308
Who are you to give such an order?

601
01:06:08,118 --> 01:06:11,110
I know what you did
to my countrymen at Fort Wilderness.

602
01:06:13,678 --> 01:06:16,795
We're militia.
This is not regular army.

603
01:06:17,838 --> 01:06:20,227
Every man here is free to
come and go as he pleases.

604
01:06:20,438 --> 01:06:21,666
But while you're here...

605
01:06:21,878 --> 01:06:24,267
...you will obey my command
or I will have you shot.

606
01:06:29,918 --> 01:06:31,909
- Damn dogs!
- Shoot the damn things!

607
01:06:32,118 --> 01:06:33,597
Stay that pistol.

608
01:06:33,838 --> 01:06:35,112
They won't let you near the wagon.

609
01:06:40,878 --> 01:06:43,187
- Rum, Madeira.
- No wonder they were guarding it.

610
01:06:43,438 --> 01:06:44,507
Officers' uniforms.

611
01:06:44,758 --> 01:06:46,555
What you think all this is worth?

612
01:06:47,958 --> 01:06:51,155
It's the personal correspondence
of Lord Cornwallis.

613
01:06:53,398 --> 01:06:54,353
This is his journal.

614
01:06:55,798 --> 01:06:59,677
I say we drink the wine, eat the dogs
and use the papers for musket wadding.

615
01:06:59,958 --> 01:07:01,232
Eat the dogs?

616
01:07:02,358 --> 01:07:04,076
Dog is a fine meal.

617
01:07:05,198 --> 01:07:06,677
Good heavens.

618
01:07:19,158 --> 01:07:21,069
I have some maps here for you.

619
01:07:22,358 --> 01:07:24,792
Put them down over there. Thank you.

620
01:07:25,998 --> 01:07:28,228
Here. A proper musket for you.

621
01:07:28,438 --> 01:07:32,431
I don't know about you, but I don't like
the idea giving muskets to slaves.

622
01:07:34,998 --> 01:07:37,193
Your sense of freedom is
as pale as your skin.

623
01:07:43,718 --> 01:07:45,356
Don't listen to them.

624
01:07:47,398 --> 01:07:49,866
If we win this war,
a lot of things will change.

625
01:07:50,718 --> 01:07:52,197
What will change?

626
01:07:53,558 --> 01:07:58,029
They call this the New World.
It's not. It's the same as the old.

627
01:08:00,518 --> 01:08:02,986
But we'll have a chance
to build a new world.

628
01:08:05,958 --> 01:08:10,270
A world where all men are
created equal under God.

629
01:08:10,998 --> 01:08:12,226
Equal.

630
01:08:13,558 --> 01:08:15,116
Sounds good.

631
01:08:16,238 --> 01:08:18,672
I've just been in the mind
of a genius.

632
01:08:21,158 --> 01:08:25,515
Cornwallis knows more about warfare than
we could learn in a dozen lifetimes.

633
01:08:26,078 --> 01:08:27,352
That's cheerful news.

634
01:08:27,798 --> 01:08:31,950
His victories at Camden and
Charles Town were perfect. Perfect.

635
01:08:32,838 --> 01:08:34,715
And he knows it, what's more.

636
01:08:36,998 --> 01:08:38,317
Perhaps that's his weakness.

637
01:08:38,798 --> 01:08:39,913
Sir?

638
01:08:41,158 --> 01:08:42,307
Pride.

639
01:08:43,438 --> 01:08:44,791
Pride's a weakness.

640
01:08:45,318 --> 01:08:47,752
Personally, I would prefer stupidity.

641
01:08:49,958 --> 01:08:51,232
Pride will do.

642
01:09:01,998 --> 01:09:03,750
Finished, my lord.

643
01:09:04,198 --> 01:09:06,109
I've taken it in at the back...

644
01:09:06,318 --> 01:09:08,912
...added wider epaulets
and looped gold braiding.

645
01:09:09,118 --> 01:09:11,791
- It's a horse blanket.
- I don't know, my lord.

646
01:09:12,278 --> 01:09:14,667
It's really quite nice.

647
01:09:14,878 --> 01:09:17,517
- Very nice, my lord.
- Very well. It's a nice horse blanket.

648
01:09:19,198 --> 01:09:21,996
Colonel Tavington,
why, after six weeks...

649
01:09:22,198 --> 01:09:25,190
...am I still attending a ball
in South Carolina...

650
01:09:25,398 --> 01:09:27,992
...when I should be attending balls
in North Carolina?

651
01:09:28,198 --> 01:09:29,711
First, the theft of my baggage...

652
01:09:29,918 --> 01:09:32,591
...including my memoirs,
on which I spent countless hours.

653
01:09:33,078 --> 01:09:36,434
Then half the bridges and ferries
between here and Charles Town burned.

654
01:09:36,918 --> 01:09:39,671
If you can't protect our supply lines
against militia...

655
01:09:39,878 --> 01:09:43,154
...how do you intend doing so against
the Regulars or the French?

656
01:09:43,358 --> 01:09:45,872
They won't fight like Regulars.
We can't find them.

657
01:09:46,078 --> 01:09:48,467
Colonel, they're militia.

658
01:09:49,078 --> 01:09:51,308
They're farmers with pitchforks!

659
01:09:52,078 --> 01:09:54,433
They're rather more than that,
I'm afraid.

660
01:09:54,718 --> 01:09:57,551
Made so by their commander,
this ghost.

661
01:09:57,758 --> 01:10:00,477
Oh, ghost, ghost, ghost.

662
01:10:01,038 --> 01:10:03,677
You created this ghost, colonel.

663
01:10:04,318 --> 01:10:06,070
Your brutality swelled his ranks.

664
01:10:06,278 --> 01:10:08,473
Without them this ghost
would've disappeared...

665
01:10:08,678 --> 01:10:10,953
...and l'd be
in North Carolina by now!

666
01:10:11,198 --> 01:10:12,426
In my defense, my lord...

667
01:10:12,678 --> 01:10:14,396
Oh, enough, enough!

668
01:10:15,078 --> 01:10:19,151
A fine soldier you are,
bested by a bedtime story.

669
01:10:20,438 --> 01:10:22,349
Give me the horse blanket.

670
01:10:25,398 --> 01:10:28,435
O'Hara, our supply ship appears
to have arrived.

671
01:10:28,958 --> 01:10:30,311
Yes, my lord, it has.

672
01:10:30,518 --> 01:10:32,873
Then why am I still wearing this rag?

673
01:10:33,078 --> 01:10:35,876
Your replacement wardrobe is
aboard ship, but...

674
01:10:36,078 --> 01:10:40,037
...Colonel Tavington thought it best to
secure our arms and munitions first.

675
01:10:40,238 --> 01:10:41,307
They are being unloaded.

676
01:10:52,598 --> 01:10:53,951
You look good in that color.

677
01:10:55,998 --> 01:10:57,226
It stinks.

678
01:10:59,118 --> 01:11:00,870
Well, it's had a dead man in it.

679
01:11:01,198 --> 01:11:02,916
The beasts took your dogs too?

680
01:11:03,278 --> 01:11:04,472
Yes.

681
01:11:05,438 --> 01:11:08,475
Fine animals.
A gift from His Majesty.

682
01:11:09,358 --> 01:11:10,837
Dead now, for all I know.

683
01:11:11,278 --> 01:11:13,428
Is there no decency?

684
01:11:22,278 --> 01:11:25,873
Oh, fireworks. Lovely!

685
01:11:56,558 --> 01:11:58,037
Mr. Howard.

686
01:11:58,958 --> 01:12:01,028
I've come to call on Anne.

687
01:12:06,558 --> 01:12:09,550
I've come to call on Anne!

688
01:12:09,758 --> 01:12:11,874
Well, of course you
call yourself a man.

689
01:12:12,838 --> 01:12:16,069
Father, stop it. You heard him.

690
01:12:18,478 --> 01:12:19,433
Well...

691
01:12:20,118 --> 01:12:21,551
...call on her.

692
01:12:46,278 --> 01:12:47,597
I'm nearly finished.

693
01:12:49,238 --> 01:12:50,990
You needn't worry, Father.

694
01:12:51,198 --> 01:12:52,597
Yeah, I know.

695
01:12:53,118 --> 01:12:56,827
Bundling bags are a wonderful
tradition. I don't mind in the least.

696
01:12:58,518 --> 01:12:59,997
Be still.

697
01:13:00,678 --> 01:13:01,747
Tea?

698
01:13:02,718 --> 01:13:03,833
Please.

699
01:13:05,718 --> 01:13:06,673
There.

700
01:13:14,758 --> 01:13:15,986
Come, dear.

701
01:13:27,038 --> 01:13:28,437
It's very good.

702
01:13:31,318 --> 01:13:33,434
I'm pleased that you like it.

703
01:13:41,918 --> 01:13:43,067
Peter.

704
01:13:43,758 --> 01:13:47,194
Don't worry. I sew better
than my mother did.

705
01:13:50,158 --> 01:13:51,591
I hope so.

706
01:13:57,558 --> 01:13:59,549
If you're just gonna stand there...

707
01:13:59,798 --> 01:14:01,470
...why don't you read it for us?

708
01:14:01,718 --> 01:14:03,197
I can't read.

709
01:14:05,878 --> 01:14:07,106
I can.

710
01:14:10,198 --> 01:14:11,187
'Take notice.

711
01:14:12,038 --> 01:14:15,428
By order of General Washington
and the Continental Congress...

712
01:14:15,678 --> 01:14:18,750
...all bound slaves who give
minimum one year service...

713
01:14:18,958 --> 01:14:20,391
...in the Continental Army...

714
01:14:21,198 --> 01:14:23,154
...will be granted freedom...

715
01:14:23,798 --> 01:14:27,427
...and be paid a bounty of five
shillings for each month of service.'

716
01:14:27,878 --> 01:14:29,197
Did you hear that?

717
01:14:29,398 --> 01:14:31,593
First they'll free them,
then they'll pay them.

718
01:14:32,838 --> 01:14:34,988
Only another six months.

719
01:14:37,518 --> 01:14:39,270
What will you do with freedom?

720
01:14:50,198 --> 01:14:51,790
I made this for you.

721
01:15:07,478 --> 01:15:09,196
Look after your mother.

722
01:15:14,478 --> 01:15:15,911
You know, Peter...

723
01:15:16,678 --> 01:15:18,111
...I can't pay you for this.

724
01:15:18,318 --> 01:15:22,311
Benjamin, you pay me what you can,
when you can.

725
01:15:22,758 --> 01:15:24,111
I'm obliged.

726
01:15:25,398 --> 01:15:28,674
Gabriel sure reminds me a lot of you.

727
01:15:29,758 --> 01:15:31,908
No, no, he's more like his mother.

728
01:15:33,718 --> 01:15:34,753
Corporal!

729
01:15:36,238 --> 01:15:38,035
Take your time. Dogs.

730
01:15:54,678 --> 01:15:55,667
Sir.

731
01:16:40,078 --> 01:16:41,875
This road is closed.

732
01:16:42,318 --> 01:16:44,434
These wagons now belong to
the Continental Army.

733
01:16:44,918 --> 01:16:47,307
Ready arms!

734
01:16:59,598 --> 01:17:00,917
By twos!

735
01:17:09,678 --> 01:17:13,034
There's no need for your men to die.
Leave the wagons and go.

736
01:17:13,558 --> 01:17:15,196
This is the king's highway.

737
01:17:15,598 --> 01:17:18,192
And I advise you and your men
to make way.

738
01:17:24,838 --> 01:17:25,907
Charge!

739
01:17:26,878 --> 01:17:27,947
Fire!

740
01:17:29,198 --> 01:17:30,517
Retreat!

741
01:17:37,238 --> 01:17:38,591
Save yourselves!

742
01:18:05,598 --> 01:18:06,553
Retreat!

743
01:18:24,398 --> 01:18:26,673
Ambush! Ambush!

744
01:18:58,878 --> 01:19:00,436
I have the count.

745
01:19:01,838 --> 01:19:03,590
22 are dead.

746
01:19:04,278 --> 01:19:06,553
18 wounded and 20 are missing.

747
01:19:06,838 --> 01:19:08,112
I'm through.

748
01:19:13,878 --> 01:19:15,470
He won't be the last to leave.

749
01:19:16,118 --> 01:19:18,268
Trust me.
Soon my countrymen will arrive.

750
01:19:18,478 --> 01:19:20,230
- The French army is...
- To hell with you.

751
01:19:20,558 --> 01:19:22,071
And to hell with the French army.

752
01:19:22,278 --> 01:19:23,347
We don't need them.

753
01:19:23,598 --> 01:19:26,670
We got Benjamin Martin.
We know what he done to the French.

754
01:19:40,598 --> 01:19:41,872
Father.

755
01:19:42,398 --> 01:19:46,676
Men always buy you drinks because
of what happened at Fort Wilderness.

756
01:19:48,958 --> 01:19:51,472
Strangers know more
about you than I do.

757
01:19:53,478 --> 01:19:55,070
Tell me what happened.

758
01:19:56,158 --> 01:20:00,709
Your mother asked me that question
around about the time you were born.

759
01:20:03,278 --> 01:20:05,872
I was drunk and foolish enough
to answer it.

760
01:20:12,238 --> 01:20:15,594
The French and the Cherokee had raided
along the Blue Ridge.

761
01:20:16,278 --> 01:20:19,236
The English settlers had sought refuge
at Fort Charles.

762
01:20:19,678 --> 01:20:22,750
By the time we got there,
the fort was abandoned.

763
01:20:23,998 --> 01:20:26,034
They'd left about a week before.

764
01:20:27,438 --> 01:20:29,906
But what we found was...

765
01:20:32,558 --> 01:20:33,752
Go on.

766
01:20:36,758 --> 01:20:40,114
They'd killed all the settlers,
the men.

767
01:20:42,078 --> 01:20:43,796
With the women and...

768
01:20:43,998 --> 01:20:46,114
...some of the children, they had...

769
01:20:49,078 --> 01:20:51,911
We buried them all,
what was left of them.

770
01:20:54,478 --> 01:20:57,072
We caught up with them
at Fort Wilderness.

771
01:21:00,038 --> 01:21:01,551
We took our time.

772
01:21:03,798 --> 01:21:06,676
We cut them apart slowly.

773
01:21:07,318 --> 01:21:08,956
Piece by piece.

774
01:21:14,078 --> 01:21:15,989
I can see their faces.

775
01:21:19,118 --> 01:21:21,268
I can still hear their screams.

776
01:21:23,278 --> 01:21:26,475
All but two. We let them live.

777
01:21:27,798 --> 01:21:29,834
We sent the heads on a pallet...

778
01:21:30,038 --> 01:21:32,552
...with the two that lived
back to Fort Ambercon.

779
01:21:33,278 --> 01:21:36,429
The eyes, tongues, fingers...

780
01:21:36,678 --> 01:21:38,509
...we put in baskets.

781
01:21:38,878 --> 01:21:41,711
Sent them down the Asheulot
to the Cherokee.

782
01:21:43,598 --> 01:21:46,954
Soon after, the Cherokee broke
their treaty with the French.

783
01:21:49,718 --> 01:21:51,595
That's how we justified it.

784
01:22:00,278 --> 01:22:01,597
We were...

785
01:22:03,158 --> 01:22:04,477
...heroes.

786
01:22:06,798 --> 01:22:08,868
And men bought you drinks.

787
01:22:13,398 --> 01:22:17,232
Not a day goes by where I don't ask
God's forgiveness for what I did.

788
01:22:25,078 --> 01:22:28,912
Thomas was my brother,
as well as your son.

789
01:22:29,238 --> 01:22:33,026
You may not believe this, but I want
satisfaction as much as you do.

790
01:22:34,958 --> 01:22:36,949
But not at the expense of our cause.

791
01:22:38,118 --> 01:22:40,586
There will be a time for revenge.

792
01:22:41,518 --> 01:22:43,873
But until then, stay the course.

793
01:22:45,918 --> 01:22:48,990
Your mother said that when
l'd get drunk or lose my temper.

794
01:22:49,198 --> 01:22:51,587
She'd say it to me
when I picked on Thomas.

795
01:22:57,358 --> 01:22:58,677
I miss him.

796
01:23:14,518 --> 01:23:17,510
The British got 18 of our men
at Fort Carolina.

797
01:23:18,118 --> 01:23:20,837
They'll be hung one at a time until
they give up the rest of us.

798
01:23:36,118 --> 01:23:37,346
Reverend...

799
01:23:37,558 --> 01:23:39,435
...can you write a letter for me?

800
01:23:39,958 --> 01:23:42,426
- To my wife and boy.
- Yes, of course I will.

801
01:23:42,678 --> 01:23:45,431
But first let us pray.

802
01:23:59,798 --> 01:24:00,708
My lord...

803
01:24:00,918 --> 01:24:02,715
...there is a rider at the gates.

804
01:24:02,918 --> 01:24:05,716
A civilian carrying a white flag.

805
01:24:05,918 --> 01:24:07,431
I am occupied.

806
01:24:07,918 --> 01:24:10,193
He has a pair of dogs with him.

807
01:24:10,838 --> 01:24:13,113
Great Danes.

808
01:24:14,078 --> 01:24:14,988
And dear Lord...

809
01:24:15,198 --> 01:24:17,428
...protect us in this,
our hour of need.

810
01:24:17,718 --> 01:24:21,154
This we ask in the name
of the Father, the Son...

811
01:24:21,358 --> 01:24:23,030
And the Holy Ghost.

812
01:24:27,958 --> 01:24:29,107
Wait here.

813
01:24:29,398 --> 01:24:31,673
General Lord Cornwallis will be
with you shortly.

814
01:25:13,358 --> 01:25:16,111
Jupiter, Mars. Come, boys.

815
01:25:18,918 --> 01:25:19,907
Come.

816
01:25:23,238 --> 01:25:26,992
My good boys. My brave boys.
You seem to be well-fed.

817
01:25:28,798 --> 01:25:30,311
I thank you for that.

818
01:25:30,518 --> 01:25:32,952
I'm afraid I don't know your name.

819
01:25:33,198 --> 01:25:37,237
I'm a colonel in the Continental Army.
My rank should be sufficient for now.

820
01:25:38,078 --> 01:25:39,477
As you wish.

821
01:25:40,278 --> 01:25:41,427
Please be seated.

822
01:25:41,718 --> 01:25:42,673
Thank you.

823
01:25:44,438 --> 01:25:47,987
Would you, as the initiating officer,
care to begin?

824
01:25:48,558 --> 01:25:51,356
I will, unless you'd like to
claim aggrieved status.

825
01:25:51,558 --> 01:25:54,118
Yes, I would like to claim
aggrieved status.

826
01:25:54,318 --> 01:25:55,956
Very well, sir. Proceed.

827
01:25:56,278 --> 01:26:00,510
You have in your possession belongings
of mine including clothing...

828
01:26:00,758 --> 01:26:04,148
...furniture, personal effects
of a non-military nature...

829
01:26:04,798 --> 01:26:06,470
...which l'd like returned to me.

830
01:26:06,878 --> 01:26:09,517
Indeed. I will do so
as soon as possible.

831
01:26:11,038 --> 01:26:12,073
Thank you.

832
01:26:12,398 --> 01:26:15,435
Now we come to the matter
of the specific targeting...

833
01:26:15,678 --> 01:26:17,475
...of officers during engagements.

834
01:26:17,918 --> 01:26:20,955
You must know that in civilized
warfare, officers in the field...

835
01:26:21,158 --> 01:26:25,356
...must not be accorded inappropriate
levels of hostile attention.

836
01:26:26,318 --> 01:26:29,754
To your mind, what are appropriate
levels of hostile attention?

837
01:26:29,958 --> 01:26:32,153
Imagine the chaos that would follow...

838
01:26:32,398 --> 01:26:35,470
...from leaderless armies
having at each other.

839
01:26:35,878 --> 01:26:38,950
There must be gentlemen in command
to lead...

840
01:26:39,158 --> 01:26:42,355
...and, where necessary,
restrain their men.

841
01:26:43,318 --> 01:26:47,277
Restrain them from, say, targeting
civilians. Women, children and such.

842
01:26:50,478 --> 01:26:51,627
That's a separate issue.

843
01:26:51,838 --> 01:26:53,715
No. I consider them linked.

844
01:26:54,358 --> 01:26:56,952
And as long as your soldiers
attack civilians...

845
01:26:57,158 --> 01:27:00,116
...I will order the shooting
of officers at every engagement.

846
01:27:02,718 --> 01:27:04,913
And my men are excellent marksmen.

847
01:27:08,998 --> 01:27:09,987
Very well.

848
01:27:10,718 --> 01:27:13,391
- Now, let us move on to...
- Prisoner exchange.

849
01:27:14,518 --> 01:27:15,473
Sir?

850
01:27:16,278 --> 01:27:19,475
You have 18 of my men.
I want them back.

851
01:27:26,038 --> 01:27:30,509
I do have 18 criminals
under sentence of death...

852
01:27:30,758 --> 01:27:33,147
...but I hold no prisoners of war.

853
01:27:33,678 --> 01:27:36,511
If that's your position,
18 of your officers will have to die.

854
01:27:36,758 --> 01:27:38,749
Nineteen, if you hang me with my men.

855
01:27:38,958 --> 01:27:39,947
My officers?

856
01:27:40,158 --> 01:27:41,147
Sir.

857
01:27:48,398 --> 01:27:51,231
Top of the ridge, to your left.
Below the tree line.

858
01:28:03,838 --> 01:28:04,953
Their names and ranks?

859
01:28:05,278 --> 01:28:09,066
They refused to give names. There are
9 lieutenants, 5 captains, 3 majors...

860
01:28:09,278 --> 01:28:10,996
...and one fat colonel
who called me...

861
01:28:12,878 --> 01:28:14,516
...a cheeky fellow.

862
01:28:14,958 --> 01:28:17,597
This is not the conduct
of a gentleman.

863
01:28:17,838 --> 01:28:20,750
If the conduct of your officers is
the measure of a gentleman...

864
01:28:20,958 --> 01:28:22,949
...I'll take that as a compliment.

865
01:28:24,878 --> 01:28:26,027
Get my men.

866
01:28:29,798 --> 01:28:32,437
- Arrange the exchange.
- My lord.

867
01:28:32,678 --> 01:28:33,793
Thank you, sir.

868
01:29:03,998 --> 01:29:05,750
Release the prisoners!

869
01:29:10,318 --> 01:29:12,388
- What is this?
- Prisoner exchange.

870
01:29:12,598 --> 01:29:14,077
He has 18 of our officers.

871
01:29:14,278 --> 01:29:16,109
Who is he? I recognize him.

872
01:29:16,558 --> 01:29:18,150
He's the commander of the militia.

873
01:29:19,518 --> 01:29:20,473
Your ghost.

874
01:29:20,678 --> 01:29:22,270
Stay that sword, colonel!

875
01:29:22,598 --> 01:29:24,748
He rode in under a white flag
for formal parley.

876
01:29:25,118 --> 01:29:26,346
This is madness.

877
01:29:26,998 --> 01:29:29,068
If you harm him,
you condemn our officers.

878
01:29:30,558 --> 01:29:34,676
With respect, sir, he's killed as many
officers in the last two months.

879
01:29:34,878 --> 01:29:39,190
He has shown no aggression here.
Hence he cannot be touched.

880
01:29:39,478 --> 01:29:40,957
Has he not?

881
01:29:44,438 --> 01:29:45,393
You!

882
01:29:46,078 --> 01:29:48,911
So you're the ghost, are you?
I remember you!

883
01:29:49,118 --> 01:29:51,109
On that farm! That stupid little boy!

884
01:29:57,838 --> 01:29:59,157
Did he die?

885
01:30:03,118 --> 01:30:04,153
You know...

886
01:30:04,598 --> 01:30:07,112
...it's an ugly business,
doing one's duty.

887
01:30:07,318 --> 01:30:09,354
But just occasionally...

888
01:30:09,998 --> 01:30:11,590
...it's a real pleasure.

889
01:30:15,518 --> 01:30:18,237
Before this war is over,
I'm going to kill you.

890
01:30:21,718 --> 01:30:23,151
Why wait?

891
01:30:32,118 --> 01:30:33,233
Soon.

892
01:31:04,918 --> 01:31:06,067
Move out!

893
01:31:10,678 --> 01:31:13,875
But I still think it's imperative
to push north.

894
01:31:16,918 --> 01:31:19,148
One of our captured officers, my lord.

895
01:31:23,838 --> 01:31:26,989
My reputation suffers
because of your incompetence!

896
01:31:27,198 --> 01:31:30,349
That man insults me!

897
01:31:30,838 --> 01:31:34,387
Quite impressive for a farmer with
a pitchfork, wouldn't you say?

898
01:31:41,278 --> 01:31:43,872
I want you to find that man.

899
01:31:44,558 --> 01:31:46,514
I want you to capture him.

900
01:31:47,878 --> 01:31:49,994
The man has the loyalty of the people.

901
01:31:50,478 --> 01:31:52,753
They protect him. Protect his family.

902
01:31:52,958 --> 01:31:54,516
Protect the families of his men.

903
01:31:55,878 --> 01:31:57,789
I can capture him for you.

904
01:31:59,278 --> 01:32:02,987
But to do so requires the use
of tactics that are somewhat...

905
01:32:04,198 --> 01:32:06,314
What was the word
your lordship used?

906
01:32:08,118 --> 01:32:09,676
' Brutal,' I think.

907
01:32:18,038 --> 01:32:19,027
Go on.

908
01:32:27,798 --> 01:32:30,232
I am prepared to do what is necessary.

909
01:32:30,558 --> 01:32:34,836
I alone will assume the full mantle
of responsibility for my actions...

910
01:32:35,038 --> 01:32:37,074
...free of the chain of command...

911
01:32:37,278 --> 01:32:39,428
...rendering you blameless.

912
01:32:40,038 --> 01:32:41,357
However...

913
01:32:41,718 --> 01:32:43,276
...if I do this...

914
01:32:43,478 --> 01:32:47,266
...you and I both know that I can
never return to England with honor.

915
01:32:50,398 --> 01:32:53,993
What, I wonder, is to become of me?

916
01:33:01,278 --> 01:33:04,111
When this war is over here
in the Colonies...

917
01:33:04,558 --> 01:33:06,276
...the new aristocracy...

918
01:33:08,278 --> 01:33:10,030
...will be landowners.

919
01:33:17,038 --> 01:33:19,552
Tell me about Ohio.

920
01:33:24,958 --> 01:33:26,107
Make way.

921
01:33:27,158 --> 01:33:28,352
As you were.

922
01:33:31,358 --> 01:33:35,271
Wilkins. A plantation seven miles
from Wakefield, on the Santee...

923
01:33:35,478 --> 01:33:37,673
...east of Black Swamp.
Who lived there?

924
01:33:39,678 --> 01:33:40,997
Benjamin Martin.

925
01:33:41,198 --> 01:33:42,153
He's the ghost.

926
01:33:43,718 --> 01:33:44,912
What do you know about him?

927
01:33:45,118 --> 01:33:48,747
Hell, everything.
I could tell you the size of his boot.

928
01:33:49,438 --> 01:33:53,147
Does he have family?
Where would he hide his children?

929
01:34:01,678 --> 01:34:04,146
His wife's sister has a plantation.

930
01:34:04,678 --> 01:34:06,111
It's not far.

931
01:34:38,518 --> 01:34:41,590
Aunt Charlotte!
Wake up, someone's coming!

932
01:34:46,878 --> 01:34:48,470
Get the boys.

933
01:34:50,798 --> 01:34:53,312
Margaret, come quickly.

934
01:34:53,518 --> 01:34:56,191
- Let's go.
- Boys, come.

935
01:34:56,758 --> 01:34:57,747
Go.

936
01:35:02,198 --> 01:35:03,870
Stay close.

937
01:35:09,398 --> 01:35:10,751
This way.

938
01:35:26,558 --> 01:35:27,786
Follow me.

939
01:35:31,038 --> 01:35:33,472
We'll go downstairs to the kitchen.

940
01:35:39,358 --> 01:35:41,553
Margaret, quick!
Get down there! Fast!

941
01:35:52,958 --> 01:35:54,914
Samuel, get down there fast!

942
01:36:49,918 --> 01:36:51,829
Beneath the sill. There.

943
01:36:54,278 --> 01:36:55,757
There's no one in the house.

944
01:36:55,958 --> 01:36:57,357
They can't be far.

945
01:36:57,758 --> 01:37:00,067
Search the outbuildings
and the woods, quickly.

946
01:37:36,238 --> 01:37:38,035
Prepare to fire the house.

947
01:37:38,798 --> 01:37:40,117
Go.

948
01:37:59,038 --> 01:38:00,949
This one's head of the house slaves.

949
01:38:05,918 --> 01:38:07,431
Where are they hiding?

950
01:38:11,118 --> 01:38:13,393
Keep looking!
They're here somewhere!

951
01:38:18,998 --> 01:38:20,670
- Gabriel.
- Where's Father?

952
01:38:20,878 --> 01:38:22,516
Torch the house!

953
01:38:39,478 --> 01:38:40,433
To horse!

954
01:38:47,478 --> 01:38:49,116
Come on! Lt's all right.

955
01:38:49,318 --> 01:38:51,149
Susan, come here.

956
01:38:59,958 --> 01:39:01,107
Charlotte!

957
01:39:16,278 --> 01:39:19,031
They won't stop looking for us.

958
01:39:21,238 --> 01:39:23,308
You'll be safe where we're taking you.

959
01:39:24,118 --> 01:39:26,712
Father said it was
a perfect place to hide.

960
01:39:29,078 --> 01:39:30,511
How is he?

961
01:39:35,678 --> 01:39:37,270
I don't know. I'm his son.

962
01:39:37,518 --> 01:39:39,315
Where is Father?

963
01:39:40,798 --> 01:39:42,311
Speaking for months now.

964
01:39:42,518 --> 01:39:44,031
Speaking for months.

965
01:39:44,238 --> 01:39:45,990
Why did he go?

966
01:39:48,078 --> 01:39:51,787
He didn't want those mean men
to find you, so he led them away.

967
01:39:51,998 --> 01:39:54,273
He'll come see you as soon as he can.

968
01:39:54,718 --> 01:39:57,107
I don't care. I hate him.

969
01:39:58,758 --> 01:40:00,396
Susan, you don't hate him.

970
01:40:00,598 --> 01:40:03,954
I hate him, and I hope
he never comes back.

971
01:40:36,398 --> 01:40:38,195
It's the children.

972
01:40:39,198 --> 01:40:40,187
Abigale!

973
01:40:41,998 --> 01:40:43,477
You're alive!

974
01:40:52,238 --> 01:40:55,913
She spoke. Susan talked to you?

975
01:40:56,118 --> 01:40:57,710
In full sentences.

976
01:40:57,918 --> 01:41:00,432
As if she'd been speaking all along.

977
01:41:02,718 --> 01:41:04,595
Damn, I wasn't there for it.

978
01:41:05,758 --> 01:41:06,827
What did she say?

979
01:41:09,278 --> 01:41:10,996
She said...

980
01:41:12,438 --> 01:41:15,475
...that she loves you
and misses you...

981
01:41:15,838 --> 01:41:18,033
...but understands
why you can't be with her.

982
01:41:21,278 --> 01:41:23,030
My Lord, she said that.

983
01:41:23,678 --> 01:41:24,997
Isn't that something?

984
01:41:28,958 --> 01:41:31,711
Tavington has a list of our men.
He's burning our homes...

985
01:41:31,918 --> 01:41:33,715
...killing whomever resists.

986
01:41:34,318 --> 01:41:35,273
Where?

987
01:41:35,478 --> 01:41:37,594
Seven homes along the Santee so far.

988
01:42:33,918 --> 01:42:36,148
John, this is not a time
for vengeance.

989
01:42:36,918 --> 01:42:39,386
This is a time for mourning.

990
01:43:12,438 --> 01:43:14,110
Attend to your families.

991
01:43:16,398 --> 01:43:18,593
One week furlough for all men.

992
01:43:19,398 --> 01:43:23,516
Any man who does not return will not
be thought a coward or uncommitted.

993
01:43:38,958 --> 01:43:40,232
Father!

994
01:43:41,758 --> 01:43:43,237
Papa!

995
01:43:49,238 --> 01:43:51,069
They're huge.
What have you been feeding them?

996
01:43:51,278 --> 01:43:54,270
They're from good stock
on their father's side.

997
01:44:02,598 --> 01:44:03,826
Susan?

998
01:44:42,358 --> 01:44:45,589
I see it. There it is. Look.
Look, father.

999
01:44:47,678 --> 01:44:49,475
I got it! I got it!

1000
01:44:49,918 --> 01:44:50,873
You got it.

1001
01:44:51,598 --> 01:44:52,917
I got it!

1002
01:44:53,118 --> 01:44:54,153
- Careful.
- I caught it.

1003
01:44:54,358 --> 01:44:56,872
- All the fish are over here.
- Let's get them.

1004
01:45:03,478 --> 01:45:05,275
Father, what changed you?

1005
01:45:07,758 --> 01:45:09,396
Are you sure I have?

1006
01:45:09,758 --> 01:45:12,431
Yes. You changed.

1007
01:45:19,598 --> 01:45:20,917
That's simple.

1008
01:45:21,718 --> 01:45:22,673
It was your mother.

1009
01:45:27,798 --> 01:45:30,596
A woman can have a strange effect
on a man.

1010
01:45:31,838 --> 01:45:33,396
There were times...

1011
01:45:34,038 --> 01:45:36,188
...I had trouble breathing
around your mother.

1012
01:45:37,358 --> 01:45:38,950
I know the feeling.

1013
01:45:40,958 --> 01:45:42,516
You once said...

1014
01:45:45,358 --> 01:45:47,792
...when I had a family of my own,
l'd understand.

1015
01:45:51,598 --> 01:45:53,077
You were right.

1016
01:45:55,558 --> 01:45:57,355
You're trying to tell me something.

1017
01:46:13,558 --> 01:46:14,877
- Apple?
- Thank you.

1018
01:46:21,678 --> 01:46:22,747
Congratulations.

1019
01:46:22,958 --> 01:46:24,550
Anne Patricia Howard...

1020
01:46:24,838 --> 01:46:28,797
...will you have this man to be
your husband to live in marriage?

1021
01:46:29,118 --> 01:46:31,586
Will you love, comfort
and honor him...

1022
01:46:31,798 --> 01:46:33,914
...for so long as you both shall live?

1023
01:46:34,478 --> 01:46:35,797
I will.

1024
01:46:36,198 --> 01:46:39,270
Gabriel Edward Martin, will you have
this woman to be your wife...

1025
01:46:39,478 --> 01:46:42,038
...to live together
in the covenant of marriage?

1026
01:46:42,398 --> 01:46:46,152
Will you love, comfort and honor her
as long as you both shall live?

1027
01:46:46,598 --> 01:46:47,633
I will.

1028
01:46:47,838 --> 01:46:50,557
Then by the power vested in me
by our mutual faith...

1029
01:46:50,798 --> 01:46:52,595
...in the Lord, our God...

1030
01:46:52,838 --> 01:46:55,989
...I now pronounce you man and wife.

1031
01:47:22,038 --> 01:47:24,188
I'm sorry we didn't give you
more warning.

1032
01:47:24,398 --> 01:47:25,387
It's fine.

1033
01:47:25,958 --> 01:47:27,311
I have something for you.

1034
01:47:29,958 --> 01:47:31,676
It belonged to Gabriel's mother.

1035
01:47:31,878 --> 01:47:33,516
It's beautiful.

1036
01:47:34,478 --> 01:47:35,672
Allow me.

1037
01:47:36,958 --> 01:47:38,357
It's the North Star.

1038
01:47:38,918 --> 01:47:42,354
That's the only star in the sky
that never moves.

1039
01:47:42,758 --> 01:47:45,556
It's constant, unwavering.

1040
01:47:46,038 --> 01:47:47,312
A guide.

1041
01:47:50,758 --> 01:47:52,191
L'd be honored.

1042
01:47:57,278 --> 01:47:58,233
May I?

1043
01:47:58,438 --> 01:48:00,429
- Lf you must.
- I must.

1044
01:48:16,038 --> 01:48:17,471
May I sit with you?

1045
01:48:17,758 --> 01:48:19,669
It's a free country.

1046
01:48:20,358 --> 01:48:21,711
Or at least it will be.

1047
01:48:33,478 --> 01:48:35,469
I'm not my sister.

1048
01:48:36,478 --> 01:48:38,070
I know that.

1049
01:48:38,758 --> 01:48:40,157
Do you?

1050
01:48:41,398 --> 01:48:42,877
Yes, I do.

1051
01:48:43,878 --> 01:48:45,391
Very well, then.

1052
01:48:49,838 --> 01:48:50,793
Well?

1053
01:48:52,438 --> 01:48:53,666
Well what?

1054
01:49:14,958 --> 01:49:16,710
I'll see you in Pembroke soon.

1055
01:49:16,918 --> 01:49:18,590
Not soon enough.

1056
01:49:19,238 --> 01:49:21,069
I'm counting on you to make sure...

1057
01:49:21,278 --> 01:49:22,757
- I know.
- What?

1058
01:49:22,958 --> 01:49:24,596
Say my prayers, take care of everyone.

1059
01:49:24,878 --> 01:49:26,357
Couldn't have said it better.

1060
01:49:30,958 --> 01:49:31,947
Goodbye.

1061
01:49:32,518 --> 01:49:33,746
Goodbye.

1062
01:49:53,078 --> 01:49:54,272
Goodbye, Susan.

1063
01:49:56,758 --> 01:49:57,873
Goodbye?

1064
01:50:00,878 --> 01:50:02,470
Just one word, that's all I want.

1065
01:50:11,318 --> 01:50:12,353
All right.

1066
01:50:38,918 --> 01:50:40,271
Papa!

1067
01:50:42,838 --> 01:50:45,113
Papa, don't go! I'll say anything.

1068
01:50:49,678 --> 01:50:50,997
Please, Papa.

1069
01:50:53,318 --> 01:50:55,274
I'll say anything you want.

1070
01:50:55,478 --> 01:50:58,470
Tell me what you want me to say.
I'll say anything.

1071
01:51:01,238 --> 01:51:03,911
I promise, Papa. Please don't go.

1072
01:51:04,998 --> 01:51:06,272
I promise.

1073
01:51:07,118 --> 01:51:08,517
I'll come back.

1074
01:51:09,318 --> 01:51:11,274
I'll come back. You believe me?

1075
01:51:14,558 --> 01:51:16,549
You know, you make me very happy.

1076
01:51:51,038 --> 01:51:52,710
Just the three of us?

1077
01:51:53,158 --> 01:51:55,467
John Raskin did come by earlier.

1078
01:51:56,278 --> 01:51:58,109
He looked around, then he left.

1079
01:51:59,158 --> 01:52:00,432
He would've made four.

1080
01:52:00,918 --> 01:52:02,590
Four would have been better.

1081
01:52:36,438 --> 01:52:39,669
I got another two months to go
before I get to twelve months.

1082
01:52:44,838 --> 01:52:45,827
Colonel.

1083
01:52:46,958 --> 01:52:48,186
Reverend.

1084
01:52:51,558 --> 01:52:52,957
Trust the French.

1085
01:52:53,718 --> 01:52:54,867
Yes, trust the French.

1086
01:52:55,078 --> 01:52:58,514
Where else do I get the opportunity
to kill a few Redcoats?

1087
01:52:59,038 --> 01:53:02,110
Perhaps a few wounded ones
when you are not looking.

1088
01:53:27,718 --> 01:53:29,754
Everyone must gather at the church.

1089
01:53:30,238 --> 01:53:31,148
Mr. Wilkins?

1090
01:53:32,678 --> 01:53:35,670
Colonel Tavington wishes to address
the whole village.

1091
01:53:52,558 --> 01:53:56,517
This town has given aid to
Benjamin Martin and his rebels.

1092
01:53:57,078 --> 01:53:58,830
I wish to know his whereabouts.

1093
01:54:00,238 --> 01:54:01,512
So...

1094
01:54:01,758 --> 01:54:03,555
...anyone who comes forward...

1095
01:54:03,918 --> 01:54:05,988
...may be forgiven their treason.

1096
01:54:11,478 --> 01:54:12,433
Very well.

1097
01:54:12,718 --> 01:54:15,027
- You had your chance.
- Wait!

1098
01:54:16,118 --> 01:54:18,234
- This man gives them supplies.
- Quiet!

1099
01:54:18,438 --> 01:54:20,315
- He brings them to Black Swamp.
- Liar!

1100
01:54:20,518 --> 01:54:22,509
In the marsh,
by the old Spanish mission.

1101
01:54:23,478 --> 01:54:24,593
This man here?

1102
01:54:24,998 --> 01:54:26,875
- Yes.
- The Black Swamp, you say?

1103
01:54:27,238 --> 01:54:29,149
By the old Spanish mission.

1104
01:54:31,158 --> 01:54:32,511
Thank you very much.

1105
01:54:38,438 --> 01:54:39,917
Shut the doors.

1106
01:54:42,038 --> 01:54:43,915
But you said we'd be forgiven.

1107
01:54:44,118 --> 01:54:45,233
And indeed you may!

1108
01:54:47,958 --> 01:54:49,550
That's between you and God.

1109
01:54:56,478 --> 01:54:57,797
Be strong. We must.

1110
01:54:59,678 --> 01:55:01,236
I'll fire the town on your orders.

1111
01:55:01,438 --> 01:55:02,712
The town?

1112
01:55:03,478 --> 01:55:04,957
Burn the church.

1113
01:55:07,398 --> 01:55:09,070
There's no honor in this.

1114
01:55:11,318 --> 01:55:13,991
Didn't you say all those who stand
against England...

1115
01:55:14,198 --> 01:55:16,587
...deserve to die a traitor's death?

1116
01:55:19,158 --> 01:55:21,752
Burn the church, captain.

1117
01:55:33,398 --> 01:55:34,353
Give me the torch.

1118
01:56:15,758 --> 01:56:18,147
The honor is found in the end,
not the means.

1119
01:56:19,398 --> 01:56:21,036
This will be forgotten.

1120
01:56:21,758 --> 01:56:22,827
Bordon.

1121
01:57:58,398 --> 01:57:59,672
Anne!

1122
01:58:03,678 --> 01:58:05,236
Mrs. Howard?

1123
01:58:09,238 --> 01:58:10,910
Where is everybody?

1124
01:58:15,718 --> 01:58:17,788
They're not here.

1125
01:59:23,118 --> 01:59:24,597
Gabriel's gone.

1126
02:00:08,038 --> 02:00:10,313
To arms! To arms!

1127
02:04:19,318 --> 02:04:20,546
Father.

1128
02:04:21,878 --> 02:04:23,994
Just don't talk. Don't talk.

1129
02:04:30,198 --> 02:04:31,267
Father.

1130
02:04:31,798 --> 02:04:33,868
- I'm sorry.
- Be quiet.

1131
02:04:34,078 --> 02:04:36,114
I'll take care of you.
You'll be all right.

1132
02:04:39,038 --> 02:04:42,474
I'm sorry about Thomas.

1133
02:04:48,158 --> 02:04:50,388
Oh, son, that wasn't your fault.

1134
02:04:54,318 --> 02:04:55,512
That was mine.

1135
02:04:59,718 --> 02:05:02,790
Hold on. You're gonna be all right.

1136
02:05:05,318 --> 02:05:08,116
Don't go. Gabriel, don't.

1137
02:05:35,998 --> 02:05:38,193
Oh, God help me. God help me.

1138
02:06:10,878 --> 02:06:12,106
Where is he?

1139
02:06:19,758 --> 02:06:21,555
I'll help you bury him.

1140
02:06:23,678 --> 02:06:24,906
I'll bury him.

1141
02:06:28,038 --> 02:06:30,711
My wife in Alexandria is with child.

1142
02:06:32,118 --> 02:06:33,756
My first.

1143
02:06:34,358 --> 02:06:36,155
I fight for that child.

1144
02:06:38,718 --> 02:06:41,073
Benjamin, nothing will replace
your sons.

1145
02:06:42,358 --> 02:06:46,351
But if you come with us,
you can justify their sacrifice.

1146
02:06:48,118 --> 02:06:49,471
Why?

1147
02:06:51,158 --> 02:06:54,992
Why do men feel
they can justify death?

1148
02:07:01,318 --> 02:07:03,149
Is it arrogance or...?

1149
02:07:07,678 --> 02:07:09,555
I have long feared...

1150
02:07:11,198 --> 02:07:14,588
...that my sins would return
to visit me.

1151
02:07:17,438 --> 02:07:19,952
And the cost is more than I can bear.

1152
02:07:21,238 --> 02:07:24,913
Benjamin, we have a chance.

1153
02:07:25,438 --> 02:07:28,510
Greene and Dan Morgan are
down from Virginia.

1154
02:07:31,118 --> 02:07:34,508
If we win this next battle, victory
in the war is within our grasp.

1155
02:07:34,758 --> 02:07:35,713
Go, then.

1156
02:07:35,958 --> 02:07:37,755
Seek your victory.

1157
02:07:40,918 --> 02:07:43,910
- I'm small issue to it.
- You're wrong, Benjamin.

1158
02:07:44,598 --> 02:07:46,509
You matter to your men...

1159
02:07:47,958 --> 02:07:49,789
...and to others as well.

1160
02:07:50,198 --> 02:07:51,916
Your victories...

1161
02:07:52,118 --> 02:07:53,915
...and your losses...

1162
02:07:55,158 --> 02:07:57,308
...are shared by more than you know.

1163
02:07:58,358 --> 02:08:00,428
Stay with us.

1164
02:08:00,918 --> 02:08:02,749
Stay the course.

1165
02:08:12,158 --> 02:08:14,194
I have run my course.

1166
02:08:33,398 --> 02:08:35,787
You men will be leaving with us.

1167
02:08:38,518 --> 02:08:39,997
Prepare the baggage.

1168
02:09:41,878 --> 02:09:42,867
Jean.

1169
02:10:33,838 --> 02:10:36,875
Tomorrow's battle can alter
the course of the war.

1170
02:10:37,078 --> 02:10:39,956
General Greene, what exactly is
the task before us?

1171
02:10:40,158 --> 02:10:43,116
Gentlemen, Cornwallis has us cornered.

1172
02:10:43,758 --> 02:10:45,396
Not only does he outnumber us...

1173
02:10:45,598 --> 02:10:48,510
...but nearly half of our force
is militia.

1174
02:10:49,798 --> 02:10:51,993
Unreliable, at best.

1175
02:10:52,318 --> 02:10:54,070
Excuse me, sir.

1176
02:10:55,718 --> 02:10:57,390
You underestimate our militia.

1177
02:10:59,518 --> 02:11:00,837
All of you do.

1178
02:11:01,598 --> 02:11:04,158
We've seen our militia lines break
time and again.

1179
02:11:04,358 --> 02:11:05,916
Kips Bay, Princeton.

1180
02:11:06,278 --> 02:11:08,269
But the British have seen that too.

1181
02:11:09,158 --> 02:11:12,753
Cornwallis' own letters bear out that
he has no respect for the militia.

1182
02:11:13,478 --> 02:11:15,753
What are you suggesting, Ben?

1183
02:11:17,118 --> 02:11:18,949
I'm suggesting we use that.

1184
02:11:25,838 --> 02:11:29,672
I know you men have sacrificed
a lot so far.

1185
02:11:29,878 --> 02:11:33,109
But all I'm asking is that you...

1186
02:11:33,318 --> 02:11:36,355
...let the front line of the militia
fire two shots tomorrow.

1187
02:11:38,438 --> 02:11:41,396
A lot can happen in the time it takes
to fire two shots.

1188
02:11:41,678 --> 02:11:44,033
Especially against British Regulars.

1189
02:11:44,998 --> 02:11:48,593
Indeed. That's why I'm not asking you
to fire three.

1190
02:12:43,398 --> 02:12:45,673
If I die, I will die well-dressed.

1191
02:13:29,998 --> 02:13:31,067
Fire!

1192
02:13:34,758 --> 02:13:37,511
- Battalion!
- Company, halt!

1193
02:13:53,918 --> 02:13:54,953
Harry...

1194
02:13:55,878 --> 02:13:57,755
...will you give this to my children?

1195
02:14:07,878 --> 02:14:08,993
Thank you.

1196
02:14:17,838 --> 02:14:19,476
It's October now.

1197
02:14:21,998 --> 02:14:23,192
I know.

1198
02:14:23,958 --> 02:14:25,789
It's more than 12 months.

1199
02:14:26,238 --> 02:14:27,466
You're a free man.

1200
02:14:28,598 --> 02:14:31,271
I'm here now on my own accord.

1201
02:14:34,958 --> 02:14:36,949
I'm honored to have you with us.

1202
02:14:39,198 --> 02:14:40,392
Honored.

1203
02:14:41,958 --> 02:14:44,392
Shoulder arms!

1204
02:14:49,878 --> 02:14:51,436
Forward...

1205
02:14:52,198 --> 02:14:53,426
...march!

1206
02:14:58,198 --> 02:14:59,916
How old were your daughters?

1207
02:15:01,918 --> 02:15:04,307
Violette was 12 and Pauline, 10.

1208
02:15:05,438 --> 02:15:07,315
They had green eyes.

1209
02:15:08,558 --> 02:15:10,230
I'm sure they were lovely.

1210
02:15:11,838 --> 02:15:13,556
Yes, they were.

1211
02:15:24,798 --> 02:15:25,947
- Battalion!
- Company!

1212
02:15:26,318 --> 02:15:27,433
March!

1213
02:15:29,558 --> 02:15:30,786
Fire!

1214
02:15:33,438 --> 02:15:34,666
Unless I'm dreaming...

1215
02:15:35,318 --> 02:15:39,152
...I believe I see militia forming
at their center.

1216
02:15:52,958 --> 02:15:55,188
Battalion, halt!

1217
02:16:12,598 --> 02:16:14,350
Dress ranks!

1218
02:16:22,798 --> 02:16:24,231
Make ready!

1219
02:16:35,478 --> 02:16:37,230
Battalion!

1220
02:16:37,438 --> 02:16:38,473
Halt!

1221
02:16:41,398 --> 02:16:42,513
Take aim!

1222
02:16:45,958 --> 02:16:46,868
Fire!

1223
02:16:57,518 --> 02:16:58,587
Fire!

1224
02:17:18,718 --> 02:17:19,912
Hold the line!

1225
02:17:25,678 --> 02:17:28,795
- Prepare to charge!
- We haven't been given that order.

1226
02:17:29,158 --> 02:17:30,352
Charge!

1227
02:17:31,478 --> 02:17:32,513
Charge!

1228
02:17:35,918 --> 02:17:37,237
Tavington.

1229
02:17:37,438 --> 02:17:39,554
Damn him! Damn that man!

1230
02:17:41,358 --> 02:17:42,791
Make ready.

1231
02:17:43,358 --> 02:17:44,791
Take aim!

1232
02:17:45,678 --> 02:17:46,588
Fire!

1233
02:17:47,878 --> 02:17:49,152
Take aim!

1234
02:17:50,038 --> 02:17:50,993
Fire!

1235
02:17:51,198 --> 02:17:52,267
Retreat!

1236
02:17:58,078 --> 02:18:01,912
Bayonet charge. We'll see who takes
the glory from this field.

1237
02:18:02,278 --> 02:18:03,836
Charge!

1238
02:18:22,878 --> 02:18:24,197
Congratulations, my lord.

1239
02:18:24,598 --> 02:18:25,997
Infantry reserve into the center.

1240
02:18:26,198 --> 02:18:27,426
But you've taken the field.

1241
02:18:27,678 --> 02:18:28,952
Now we'll take their spirits.

1242
02:18:29,158 --> 02:18:32,070
Send the battalion over that hill
and crush them.

1243
02:18:32,278 --> 02:18:33,677
It ends today.

1244
02:18:55,998 --> 02:18:57,113
Hold the charge!

1245
02:18:58,038 --> 02:18:59,073
Fire!

1246
02:18:59,278 --> 02:19:01,473
Hold the charge!

1247
02:19:05,078 --> 02:19:06,397
Fire!

1248
02:19:11,718 --> 02:19:12,753
Take aim!

1249
02:19:14,318 --> 02:19:15,273
Fire!

1250
02:19:23,838 --> 02:19:25,317
Charge!

1251
02:19:31,878 --> 02:19:33,391
Charge bayonets!

1252
02:20:01,398 --> 02:20:02,513
Halt!

1253
02:20:03,678 --> 02:20:05,157
Hold! Dress your ranks!

1254
02:20:07,558 --> 02:20:08,707
Fire!

1255
02:20:12,118 --> 02:20:13,551
Charge!

1256
02:20:36,238 --> 02:20:37,830
Retreat!

1257
02:20:42,878 --> 02:20:43,947
Colonel!

1258
02:20:45,758 --> 02:20:47,111
The line is faltering!

1259
02:20:48,518 --> 02:20:50,907
Retreat! Retreat!

1260
02:20:58,478 --> 02:20:59,831
Wait!

1261
02:21:00,598 --> 02:21:02,270
No retreat!

1262
02:21:05,918 --> 02:21:08,068
Hold the line!

1263
02:21:09,598 --> 02:21:11,668
Hold the line!

1264
02:21:22,878 --> 02:21:25,790
Push forward, men!

1265
02:22:13,238 --> 02:22:15,433
Artillery, concentrate on the center.

1266
02:22:30,038 --> 02:22:33,587
If we reform and wheel right,
we may be able to turn their flank.

1267
02:22:33,878 --> 02:22:35,709
You dream, general.

1268
02:25:30,758 --> 02:25:33,192
Kill me before the war is over,
will you?

1269
02:25:34,798 --> 02:25:37,358
It appears you are not...

1270
02:25:37,558 --> 02:25:39,674
...the better man.

1271
02:25:52,838 --> 02:25:53,827
You're right.

1272
02:25:58,398 --> 02:26:00,434
My sons were better men.

1273
02:26:27,038 --> 02:26:28,437
Sound the retreat.

1274
02:26:31,838 --> 02:26:33,237
Sound...

1275
02:26:34,318 --> 02:26:35,467
...retreat.

1276
02:26:52,798 --> 02:26:53,753
Dear Charlotte:

1277
02:26:54,478 --> 02:26:56,150
The war has turned.

1278
02:26:56,358 --> 02:26:59,828
General Cornwallis took flight
with his army and moved north.

1279
02:27:00,118 --> 02:27:02,916
We continued to engage the British,
and in the following months...

1280
02:27:03,118 --> 02:27:06,235
...Cornwallis entrenched himself
at Yorktown, Virginia.

1281
02:27:07,598 --> 02:27:09,873
Washington escaped from the north...

1282
02:27:10,078 --> 02:27:13,150
...and surrounded Cornwallis,
who could not retreat to the seas.

1283
02:27:13,478 --> 02:27:16,550
It was blocked off by
our long-lost friends...

1284
02:27:16,798 --> 02:27:19,153
...who had finally arrived.

1285
02:27:23,518 --> 02:27:24,871
Vive la France.

1286
02:27:27,478 --> 02:27:28,991
Vive la libert.

1287
02:27:40,678 --> 02:27:42,475
My lord, I beseech you.

1288
02:27:43,078 --> 02:27:45,228
You must order the surrender.

1289
02:27:46,038 --> 02:27:49,110
How could it come to this?
An army of rabble.

1290
02:27:49,718 --> 02:27:51,071
Peasants.

1291
02:27:53,158 --> 02:27:55,035
Everything will change.

1292
02:27:58,398 --> 02:28:00,309
Everything has changed.

1293
02:28:01,078 --> 02:28:03,034
Though he eventually surrendered...

1294
02:28:03,238 --> 02:28:05,593
...Cornwallis himself hid in shame...

1295
02:28:05,798 --> 02:28:09,234
...appointing his subordinate to
relinquish his sword.

1296
02:28:10,398 --> 02:28:13,390
With the war ending,
and our militia disbanding...

1297
02:28:13,598 --> 02:28:16,158
...I take measure of what
we have lost...

1298
02:28:16,358 --> 02:28:17,837
...and what we have won.

1299
02:28:18,958 --> 02:28:23,474
My hope and prayer is that
the sacrifices borne by so many...

1300
02:28:23,718 --> 02:28:27,393
...will spawn and fulfill the promise
of our new nation.

1301
02:28:28,758 --> 02:28:32,512
Tell the children, and especially
Susan, that I will keep my promise...

1302
02:28:32,718 --> 02:28:36,188
...as I will be returning
to you all soon.

1303
02:28:42,078 --> 02:28:43,670
Where will you go now?

1304
02:28:44,398 --> 02:28:46,548
Home. Start over.

1305
02:28:46,798 --> 02:28:49,028
Your wife's expecting a child,
isn't she?

1306
02:28:49,238 --> 02:28:51,877
She gave birth to a son
three weeks ago.

1307
02:28:52,998 --> 02:28:54,317
What'd you name him?

1308
02:28:56,318 --> 02:28:58,229
We named him Gabriel.

1309
02:29:03,598 --> 02:29:04,587
Thank you, Harry.

1310
02:29:11,518 --> 02:29:14,157
Gabriel is a good name for a farmer.

1311
02:29:14,598 --> 02:29:16,907
It is. It is.

1312
02:29:17,438 --> 02:29:18,507
Jean.

1313
02:29:18,758 --> 02:29:19,713
Ben.

1314
02:30:24,398 --> 02:30:26,992
Gabriel said if we won the war...

1315
02:30:27,358 --> 02:30:29,235
...we could build a whole new world.

1316
02:30:30,198 --> 02:30:32,871
Just figured we'd get started
right here...

1317
02:30:34,238 --> 02:30:35,876
...with your home.

1318
02:30:39,718 --> 02:30:41,071
Sounds good.

1319
02:30:44,398 --> 02:30:45,353
Thank you.
