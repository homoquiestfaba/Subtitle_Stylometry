00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:38,192
PLEASE SAVE

PLEASE, MR. DUDLEY,

00:07:55,607 --> 00:07:58,877
TYCHO?
EMILY, WE TALKED ABOUT NAMING THE ANIMALS.

118
00:07:58,877 --> 00:08:01,313
IT JUST
MAKES IT HARDER WHEN...

119
00:08:01,313 --> 00:08:03,215
THINGS DON'T WORK OUT.

120
00:08:03,215 --> 00:08:05,617

00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:23,769
UM, THAT WASN'T
THE TRICK.

127
00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:26,204
EMILY, YOU'RE JUST
GONNA HAVE TO LEARN

128
00:08:26,204 --> 00:08:30,576
WE CAN'T SAVE 'EM ALL.

129
00:08:30,576 --> 00:08:33,078
IT'S OK, TYCHO.

00:08:33,078 --> 00:08:37,685

NEVER GONNA HAPPEN

IN AT LEAST
ONE REGULAR SEASON

356
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,021
TOP DOG EVENT.

357
00:20:24,021 --> 00:20:26,924
WIN ONE EVENT TO QUALIFY?
NO PROBLEM.

358
00:20:26,924 --> 00:20:29,329
SHH.

359
00:20:31,329 --> 00:20:32,897
THAT GETS YOU AN
AUTOMATIC INVITATION

360
00:20:32,897 --> 00:20:34,499
TO THE TOP
DOG FINALS.

361
00:20:34,499 --> 00:20:35,767
IT'S A
FREESTYLE EVENT

362
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:37,669
JUDGED ON A SCALE
OF ONE TO 100.

363
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:39,337
THE OWNER OF
THE DOG MUST PERFORM

364
00:20:39,337 --> 00:20:40,705
A 90-SECOND ROUTINE.

365
00:20:40,705 --> 00:20:42,340
YOU CAN DO ANYTHING.

366
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:43,508
TRICKS, ACROBATICS,

367
00:20:43,508 --> 00:20:44,709
WHATEVER WILL
IMPRESS THE JUDGES.

368
00:20:44,709 --> 00:20:47,779
SOUNDS LIKE EASY MONEY.
HA HA HA!

369
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:48,780
SHH!

370
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:52,750
YEAH, EXCEPT THE TOP DOG
SEASON IS ALMOST OVER,

371
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,085
AND WE HAPPEN
TO BE MISSING

372
00:20:54,085 --> 00:20:55,020
SOMETHING
KIND OF IMPORTANT.

373
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:58,856
LIKE WHAT?

374
00:20:58,856 --> 00:21:02,594
SHH!

375
00:21:03,594 --> 00:21:06,799
A DOG.

376
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:09,767
THIS ONE'S 850.

377
00:21:09,767 --> 00:21:12,069
850?

378
00:21:12,069 --> 00:21:12,069
DOLLARS?!

379
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:15,940
CALVIN, THESE ARE
REAL, PURE-BRED DOGS.

380
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:17,742
THEY COST REAL MONEY.

381
00:21:17,742 --> 00:21:21,782
YEAH, YEAH, WE NEED ONE
WE CAN GET REAL CHEAP.

382
00:21:24,782 --> 00:21:25,017
WHAT'S THIS SAY?

383
00:21:26,017 --> 00:21:29,497
CENTRAL CITY
ANIMAL SHELTER?

384
00:21:39,497 --> 00:21:40,998
HELLO, THERE.

385
00:21:40,998 --> 00:21:42,367
SUGAR WOOGAR.

386
00:21:42,367 --> 00:21:43,968
HOW ARE YOU TODAY?

387
00:21:43,968 --> 00:21:46,945
HELLO. HELLO,
LITTLE BUDDY.

388
00:21:53,945 --> 00:21:55,046
CALVIN?

389
00:21:55,046 --> 00:21:58,453
OH, HEY, EMILY.

390
00:22:02,453 --> 00:22:04,122
SO, HOW DOES
THIS WORK?

391
00:22:04,122 --> 00:22:07,725
HOW DOES
WHAT WORK, EXACTLY?

392
00:22:07,725 --> 00:22:09,059
YOU KNOW!

393
00:22:09,059 --> 00:22:12,965
ME, YOU KNOW,
GETTING A DOG.

394
00:22:13,965 --> 00:22:15,400
YOU'RE NOT SERIOUS.

395
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,968
YOU WOULDN'T EVEN
HOLD MY PUPPY

396
00:22:16,968 --> 00:22:18,703
WHEN I BROUGHT HIM IN
FOR SHOW AND TELL

397
00:22:18,703 --> 00:22:20,070
IN THE THIRD GRADE.

398
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:22,707
YOU REMEMBER THAT?

399
00:22:22,707 --> 00:22:24,475
YOU SAID THAT
ANIMALS WERE DIRTY.

400
00:22:24,475 --> 00:22:25,543
<i>YOU REMEMBER THAT?</i>

401
00:22:25,543 --> 00:22:27,912
CALVIN, I HAVE
KNOWN YOU FOR YEARS!

402
00:22:27,912 --> 00:22:28,746
YOU NEVER DO ANYTHING

403
00:22:28,746 --> 00:22:31,115
UNLESS THERE'S
SOMETHING IN IT FOR YOU.

404
00:22:31,115 --> 00:22:32,817
YOU KNOW WHAT?

405
00:22:32,817 --> 00:22:35,153
I THOUGHT MAYBE
ADOPTING A DOG

406
00:22:35,153 --> 00:22:36,087
WOULD BE
GOOD FOR ME,

407
00:22:36,087 --> 00:22:38,022
HELP ME TURN OVER
A NEW LEAF.

408
00:22:39,022 --> 00:22:42,495
MAYBE I CAME TO
THE WRONG PLACE.

409
00:22:44,495 --> 00:22:46,097
CALVIN, WAIT.

410
00:22:46,097 --> 00:22:50,135
UM, THERE IS ONE DOG.

411
00:22:51,135 --> 00:22:52,570
WHAT IS THAT THING?

412
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:54,075
I NAMED HIM TYCHO.

413
00:22:58,075 --> 00:23:01,479
AW, HE LIKES YOU.

414
00:23:01,479 --> 00:23:03,816
AW, GOOD BOY, TYCHO.

415
00:23:04,816 --> 00:23:05,550
OK. LOOK. OK.

416
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:08,619
ARE YOU
ABSOLUTELY, POSITIVELY,

417
00:23:08,619 --> 00:23:12,559
100 % SURE THIS IS
THE ONLY DOG AVAILABLE?

418
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:15,526
AAH!

419
00:23:15,526 --> 00:23:16,761
TYCHO! NO!

420
00:23:16,761 --> 00:23:19,063
GIVE ME THE SHIRT!
GIVE ME!

421
00:23:19,063 --> 00:23:21,632
TYCHO, WILL YOU
LET GO OF HIS SHIRT?

422
00:23:21,632 --> 00:23:24,632
PLEASE, TYCHO.

423
00:23:21,632 --> 00:23:24,202
GIVE ME THE SHIRT.

424
00:23:24,202 --> 00:23:25,703
OHH!

425
00:23:25,703 --> 00:23:27,738
HE LOVES TO
PLAY TUG-OF-WAR.

426
00:23:27,738 --> 00:23:31,679
TAKE HIM OR LEAVE HIM.

427
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:36,681
OH, AND DO ME A FAVOR.

428
00:23:36,681 --> 00:23:40,818
DON'T BUY ANY ROYAL HOUND BRAND DOG FOOD

429
00:23:40,818 --> 00:23:43,087
OR ANY OF THEIR PRODUCTS.

430
00:23:43,087 --> 00:23:45,656
THEY SPONSOR THESE
HORRIBLE DOG SHOWS

431
00:23:45,656 --> 00:23:47,792
AND I CAN'T STAND SEEING
ANIMALS EXPLOITED.

432
00:23:47,792 --> 00:23:51,796
OH, YEAH, TOTALLY. HEH.
ME, NEITHER.

433
00:23:51,796 --> 00:23:52,931
OK, UM...

434
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:56,634
ALL YOU NEED IS A SIGNATURE
FROM A PARENT OR GUARDIAN.

435
00:23:56,634 --> 00:24:01,138
THAT'S NOT GOING
TO BE A PROBLEM, IS IT?

436
00:24:01,138 --> 00:24:05,716
NO, UH... OF COURSE NOT.

437
00:24:11,716 --> 00:24:14,752
PROMISE YOU WILL
WORK HARDER NEXT SEMESTER?

438
00:24:14,752 --> 00:24:16,654
I MEAN IT THIS TIME,
CALVIN. NO SHORTCUTS.

439
00:24:16,654 --> 00:24:19,724
I'LL BRING UP MY MARKS,
I PROMISE, OK?

440
00:24:19,724 --> 00:24:23,094
OK. NOW DON'T FORGET.
SIGN HERE...

441
00:24:24,662 --> 00:24:26,764
AND RIGHT DOWN THERE.

442
00:24:26,764 --> 00:24:27,665
HERE?

443
00:24:27,665 --> 00:24:29,568
OK.

444
00:24:30,568 --> 00:24:32,739
THANK YOU, MOM.

445
00:24:36,707 --> 00:24:38,676
ECCH!

446
00:24:38,676 --> 00:24:41,779
OK, OK.
SHOULD I BE WORRIED?

447
00:24:41,779 --> 00:24:43,781
YOU KNOW, YOU KNOW,
ABOUT GERMS?

448
00:24:43,781 --> 00:24:44,016
NO, ACTUALLY HE SHOULD.

449
00:24:45,016 --> 00:24:47,752
A DOG'S MOUTH IS CLEANER
THAN A HUMAN'S.

450
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:53,858
I FIND THAT VERY HARD
TO BELIEVE.

451
00:24:53,858 --> 00:24:55,593
TYCHO!

452
00:24:55,593 --> 00:24:56,961
COME HERE, BOY.

453
00:24:56,961 --> 00:24:58,596
COME HERE. TCH TCH!

454
00:24:58,596 --> 00:25:03,801
OK, NOW THIS IS MY
HOME NUMBER.

455
00:25:03,801 --> 00:25:04,669
OK.

456
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:06,771
GIVE ME A CALL
IF YOU HAVE ANY PROBLEMS.

457
00:25:06,771 --> 00:25:09,240
AND I'LL BE COMING BY
YOUR HOUSE IN ABOUT 10 DAYS.

458
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,641
REALLY?

459
00:25:10,641 --> 00:25:13,077
YEAH. IT'S A STANDARD
POST-ADOPTION INTERVIEW.

460
00:25:13,077 --> 00:25:15,846
JUST MAKE SURE THAT
YOU'RE FIT AS AN OWNER.

461
00:25:15,846 --> 00:25:16,681
COOL.

462
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:18,649
COME ON, BUDDY.
COME ON.

463
00:25:18,649 --> 00:25:21,852
CALVIN, YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE
FOR THIS DOG NOW.

464
00:25:21,852 --> 00:25:23,621
YOU DO REALIZE THAT?

465
00:25:23,621 --> 00:25:25,723
HEY, NO PROBLEM.

466
00:25:26,857 --> 00:25:28,859
OOH!

467
00:25:29,927 --> 00:25:31,931
OK, LET'S GO.

468
00:25:33,931 --> 00:25:36,834
ALL RIGHT. GIDDY-UP!

469
00:25:36,834 --> 00:25:38,903
NO, NO, NO.
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

470
00:25:38,903 --> 00:25:40,871
I'M NOT GONNA PULL YOU, OK?

471
00:25:40,871 --> 00:25:42,007
<i>YOU ARE GONNA PULL ME, OK?</i>

472
00:25:43,007 --> 00:25:44,775

518
00:28:04,482 --> 00:28:05,883
I DON'T KNOW, CALVIN.

519
00:28:05,883 --> 00:28:07,184
LOOK, MAN, YOU WON'T
EVEN KNOW HE'S THERE.

520
00:28:07,184 --> 00:28:09,820
WHY CAN'T HE JUST
STAY WITH YOU?

521
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:10,788
ARE YOU CRAZY?

522
00:28:10,788 --> 00:28:12,356
MY PARENTS WON'T EVEN

<i>LOOK, MAN, THIS IS JUST LIKE
ISSUE 723 OF GOTHAM MAN,</i>

STAMPEDING BUFFALO MUTANTS?

00:28:18,896 --> 00:28:22,334
YEAH, BUT GOTHAM MAN HAS,
LIKE, SUPER POWERS.

526
00:28:23,334 --> 00:28:25,538
SO DO YOU.

527
00:28:27,538 --> 00:28:29,940
YOU JUST DON'T
KNOW IT YET.

00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:33,844
CALVIN. CALVIN,

529
00:28:47,558 --> 00:28:49,426
HEY, MAN, YOU OK?

530
00:28:49,426 --> 00:28:50,528
7 POUNDS.

531
00:28:50,528 --> 00:28:52,530
THAT'S THE WEIGHT LIMIT
ALLOWED FOR PETS

532
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:55,900
AT MY APARTMENT COMPLEX.
7 POUNDS.

533
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,935
COME ON, FIGG, MAN,
I WAS COUNTING ON YOU.

534
00:28:57,935 --> 00:29:00,204
<i>ISSUE 723 OF GOTHAM MAN.
REMEMBER?</i>

535
00:29:00,204 --> 00:29:03,974
GOTHAM MAN'S LANDLORD NEVER
THREATENED TO EVICT HIM.

536
00:29:05,176 --> 00:29:09,480
TYCHO'S, LIKE, 24 TIMES
OVER THE LEGAL LIMIT.

537
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:12,249
RIGHT. LET'S JUST
GET HIM IN HERE.

538
00:29:12,249 --> 00:29:14,451
SHH! SHH! SHH!

539
00:29:14,451 --> 00:29:16,086
GO! GO.

540
00:29:17,021 --> 00:29:20,591
LATER, MAN.

541
00:29:20,591 --> 00:29:22,829
LATER.

542
00:29:24,829 --> 00:29:25,496
HEY!

543
00:29:25,496 --> 00:29:26,230
HEY, HEY, HEY.

544
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:28,566
WHO DO YOU THINK
YOU ARE, BUDDY?

545
00:29:28,566 --> 00:29:30,601
YOU ARE A GUEST
IN MY HOME.

546
00:29:31,535 --> 00:29:33,137
HEY, HEY, HEY.
SHH! SHH!

547
00:29:33,137 --> 00:29:33,137
CONTROL YOURSELF.

548
00:29:33,838 --> 00:29:35,940
OK, LOOK.
YOU SLEEP HERE. OK?

549
00:29:37,007 --> 00:29:38,976
HEY! HEY.

550
00:29:38,976 --> 00:29:40,411
YOU--OK, COME ON.

551
00:29:40,411 --> 00:29:41,946
GET ON.

552
00:29:43,347 --> 00:29:44,448
ALL RIGHT. SHH!

553
00:29:44,448 --> 00:29:45,449
QUIET. OK?

554
00:29:46,283 --> 00:29:47,384
THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE.

555
00:29:47,384 --> 00:29:49,620
YOU JUST SLEEP--
YOU WANT ME TO SHOW YOU?

556
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:50,621
GO LIKE THIS.

557
00:29:50,621 --> 00:29:53,191
GO JUST LIKE THIS.

558
00:29:58,896 --> 00:30:00,898
SAY, YOU'RE SLICK.
YEAH, ALL RIGHT!

559
00:30:00,898 --> 00:30:02,867
FINALLY!

560
00:30:02,867 --> 00:30:06,370
OK? SEE? SLEEP TIME.

561
00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:08,076
GOOD TIMES, GOOD TIMES.

562
00:30:12,076 --> 00:30:15,579
OH! HEY. HEY, HEY.

563
00:30:15,579 --> 00:30:17,283
HEY.

564
00:30:36,934 --> 00:30:40,104
HEY, SWEETIE, ARE YOU OK?

565
00:30:40,104 --> 00:30:40,104
HUH?

566
00:30:40,805 --> 00:30:41,706
HEARD YOU SNORING
LAST NIGHT.

567
00:30:41,706 --> 00:30:44,541
IT SOUNDED AWFUL.
ARE YOU GETTING A COLD?

568
00:30:44,541 --> 00:30:48,512
UH... UH, YEAH.

569
00:30:48,512 --> 00:30:51,382
I'M COMING DOWN WITH SOMETHING.
'CHOO!

570
00:30:51,382 --> 00:30:52,249
EXCUSE ME.

571
00:30:52,249 --> 00:30:53,450
AND ONE MORE THING, CALVIN.

572
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:57,056
YOU'RE A GROWING BOY.
YOU REALLY NEED TO SHOWER EVERY DAY.

573
00:31:01,492 --> 00:31:03,294
OK. THERE'S ONLY ONE
SANCTIONED EVENT LEFT

574
00:31:03,294 --> 00:31:05,162
IN THE TOP DOG REGULAR
SEASON CIRCUIT.

575
00:31:05,162 --> 00:31:09,600
IT'S OUR LAST CHANCE TO GET AN
INVITATION TO THE TOP DOG FINALS.

576
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,634
ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS WIN IT.

577
00:31:10,634 --> 00:31:12,269
"OWNERS MUST
LEAD THEIR DOGS

578
00:31:12,269 --> 00:31:13,103

581
00:31:20,644 --> 00:31:22,680
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
WITH THAT?

582
00:31:23,815 --> 00:31:27,418
WELL, WHEN YOU SAID YOU WERE
COMPETING IN THE DOG SHOW

583
00:31:27,418 --> 00:31:28,453
WITH JEAN JACQUESQUISE,

584
00:31:28,453 --> 00:31:31,021
ANCIENT DOO DOO,
I DECIDED TO PUT MY DOG IN THERE.

585
00:31:33,824 --> 00:31:35,092
YOU MAY BE A BIG
DEAL AT SCHOOL,

586
00:31:35,092 --> 00:31:38,329
BUT DOG SHOWS ARE
OUT OF YOUR LEAGUE.

587
00:31:38,329 --> 00:31:39,663
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

588
00:31:39,663 --> 00:31:41,332
I WILL DESTROY YOU.

589
00:31:41,332 --> 00:31:43,634
CHILL, PRESTON. LOOK, MAN,

590
00:31:43,634 --> 00:31:46,603
I'M NOT TRYING TO STEP
ON ANYBODY'S TOES HERE.

591
00:31:46,603 --> 00:31:47,304
OK?

592
00:31:47,304 --> 00:31:48,405
YOU LISTEN TO ME
VERY CLOSELY.

593
00:31:48,405 --> 00:31:51,342
WHATEVER SCHEME YOU'RE
PLANNING WITH THAT MANGY MUTT,

594
00:31:51,342 --> 00:31:54,445
YOU BETTER JUST
DROP IT NOW. OK?

595
00:31:54,445 --> 00:31:57,381
CONSIDER YOURSELF
WARNED.

596
00:31:58,649 --> 00:32:00,452
HEY!

597
00:32:01,452 --> 00:32:02,753
HEY, HEY, HEY.

598
00:32:02,753 --> 00:32:04,753
OH--UNH!

00:32:07,658 --> 00:32:09,658
I GOT HIM!

601
00:32:07,658 --> 00:32:09,426
OHH...

00:32:09,426 --> 00:32:09,426

606
00:32:14,164 --> 00:32:15,332
TYCHO!

607

OH, JACQUES, I'M SORRY.

613
00:32:31,215 --> 00:32:33,759
STUPID DOG.

614
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:44,628
YOU'RE SUCH A MESS.

615
00:32:44,628 --> 00:32:46,628
OHH!

616
00:32:44,628 --> 00:32:46,530
OHH!

617
00:32:46,530 --> 00:32:49,233
HEY--HEY, MAN!

618
00:32:49,233 --> 00:32:50,401

619
00:32:50,401 --> 00:32:52,036
DON'T--OH! OH!

620
00:32:52,036 --> 00:32:54,571
H-HOW'S THAT,
HUH, CALVIN?

621
00:32:54,571 --> 00:32:56,507
OH! OH--

I WAS JUST, UH, UM...

670
00:36:10,801 --> 00:36:11,001
FIXING A SNACK.

671
00:36:12,001 --> 00:36:13,270
WHAT ON EARTH HAPPENED?

672
00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:14,338
AND STOP FIDGETING.

673
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:17,407
I KNOW YOU'RE
UP TO SOMETHING.

674
00:36:17,407 --> 00:36:18,675
ARE YOU OK, SON?

675
00:36:18,675 --> 00:36:20,277
WAIT! WAIT!

676
00:36:20,277 --> 00:36:22,379
THIS IS--
THIS IS ALL MY FAULT.

677
00:36:22,379 --> 00:36:23,647
THIS IS ALL MY FAULT.

678
00:36:23,647 --> 00:36:25,515
<i>WE CAN STAY HERE!</i>

679
00:36:25,515 --> 00:36:26,783
<i>WE CAN STAY HERE.</i>

680
00:36:26,783 --> 00:36:29,286
WE CAN STILL STAY HERE,
YEAH.

681
00:36:29,286 --> 00:36:30,721
DAD, DAD, LOOK.

682
00:36:30,721 --> 00:36:31,722
SEE, UM, I JUST--

683
00:36:31,722 --> 00:36:33,257
JUST HAD A COUPLE OF FRIENDS OVER,
THAT'S ALL.

684
00:36:33,257 --> 00:36:35,792
THAT'S ALL?!
CALVIN, LOOK AT THIS MESS.

685
00:36:35,792 --> 00:36:37,961
IT LOOKS LIKE FOREIGN AGENTS
RANSACKED OUR KITCHEN

686
00:36:37,961 --> 00:36:40,297
AND DIDN'T FIND WHAT
THEY WERE LOOKING FOR.

687
00:36:40,297 --> 00:36:41,765
THIS AIN'T GONNA WORK.

688
00:36:41,765 --> 00:36:43,267
LOOK, LOOK.

689
00:36:43,267 --> 00:36:45,269
LOOK, LOOK, UM--

690
00:36:45,269 --> 00:36:46,436
LOOK, I CAN EXPLAIN--

691
00:36:46,436 --> 00:36:47,971
ALL RIGHT,
LET'S HEAR IT.

692
00:36:47,971 --> 00:36:48,805
MM-HMM. OK.

693
00:36:48,805 --> 00:36:50,874
THIS IS ALL MY FAULT.
THIS IS ALL MY--

694
00:36:50,874 --> 00:36:52,276
I'LL CLEAN IT UP--

695
00:36:52,276 --> 00:36:53,110
HOLD ON, YOUNG MAN--

696
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:53,110
OK, DAD, I'LL DO IT,
I'LL CLEAN IT UP.

697
00:36:53,945 --> 00:36:56,945
THINK ABOUT IT.

698
00:36:53,945 --> 00:36:56,480
HE'S HIDING SOMETHING.

699
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,582
HE DIDN'T TRY TO MAKE
ANY EXCUSES

700
00:36:58,582 --> 00:37:00,717
AND HE DIDN'T
BLAME ANYBODY ELSE.

701
00:37:00,717 --> 00:37:01,718
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME

702
00:37:01,718 --> 00:37:06,390
I'VE EVER HEARD CALVIN
TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR...

703
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:07,760
ANYTHING.

704
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:13,764
I'M SURPRISED HE EVEN KNOWS
WHERE WE KEEP THE MOP.

705
00:37:13,764 --> 00:37:16,572
WE'LL LEAVE HIM.

706
00:37:22,572 --> 00:37:25,309
OH--OH...

707
00:37:25,309 --> 00:37:26,643
COME ON, TYCHO, COME ON.

708
00:37:26,643 --> 00:37:29,513
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

709
00:37:29,513 --> 00:37:30,614
QUIET.

710
00:37:30,614 --> 00:37:31,648
ALL RIGHT.

711
00:37:31,648 --> 00:37:33,828
LET'S GO, LET'S GO.

712
00:37:44,828 --> 00:37:45,762
TYCHO?

713
00:37:45,762 --> 00:37:47,731
TY-TY-TYCHO?

714
00:37:47,731 --> 00:37:49,900
TYCHO, MAN--

715
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:52,469
THESE ARE MY SNEAKERS!

716
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:54,671
NO. NO.

717
00:37:54,671 --> 00:37:56,506
NO, NO, NO.

718
00:37:56,506 --> 00:37:59,376
AND THIS IS MY GEOMETRY
HOMEWORK!

719
00:37:59,376 --> 00:38:00,577
NOW, DO YOU HAVE
ANY IDEA

720
00:38:00,577 --> 00:38:01,745
HOW LONG IT TOOK ME
TO DO THAT?

721
00:38:01,745 --> 00:38:04,414
NOW, YOU TELL ME,
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO TELL MY TEACHER--

722
00:38:04,414 --> 00:38:06,550
MY DOG ATE MY HOMEWORK?

723
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:09,720
CALVIN! WHO ARE YOU
YELLING AT?

724
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:10,488
UH...

725
00:38:10,488 --> 00:38:12,456
IS EVERYTHING
ALL RIGHT IN THERE?

726
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:13,123
YEAH, MOM!

727
00:38:13,123 --> 00:38:14,424
I WAS JUST, UH...

728
00:38:14,424 --> 00:38:16,827
DOING MY NIGHTLY
MEDITATIONS.

729
00:38:16,827 --> 00:38:20,364
OHM... OHM...

730
00:38:21,498 --> 00:38:23,038
OHM... OHM...

731
00:38:28,038 --> 00:38:31,475
BREAKIN' THE HOUSE,
CHEWIN' UP MY SNEAKERS,

732
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:33,577
EATING MY HOMEWORK.
I DON'T CARE ABOUT THIS DOG,

733
00:38:33,577 --> 00:38:35,012
SO EVEN IF IT IS
ANOTHER WEEK...

734
00:38:36,012 --> 00:38:37,848
WE ARE OVER.

735
00:38:37,848 --> 00:38:39,616
YOU HEAR ME?

736
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:41,821
WE ARE OVER.

737
00:38:49,793 --> 00:38:50,661
RIGHT AFTER SCHOOL

738
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:52,696
TYCHO IS GOING RIGHT BACK
TO THE POUND.

739
00:38:52,696 --> 00:38:53,864
BUT WHAT ABOUT THE SHOW?

740
00:38:53,864 --> 00:38:55,799
IT IS NOT WORTH IT.

741
00:38:55,799 --> 00:38:57,501
CALVIN, HE'S YOUR
RESPONSIBILITY.

742
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:58,602
NOT ANYMORE.

743
00:38:58,602 --> 00:38:59,636
HEY, CALVIN.

744
00:38:59,636 --> 00:39:01,070
HOW YA DOIN', BUDDY?

745
00:39:01,070 --> 00:39:03,173
WHAT'S UP, LEONARD?
WHAT'S UP, THRASH?

746
00:39:03,173 --> 00:39:06,076
YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T REALIZE
IT WAS GARBAGE DAY.

747
00:39:06,076 --> 00:39:08,678
LOOK, THIS IS KIND OF
AWKWARD FOR US.

748
00:39:08,678 --> 00:39:09,980
HOW DO I PUT THIS?

749
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:12,749
WELL, IT'S LIKE THIS--

750
00:39:12,749 --> 00:39:14,551
WE GOTTA POUND ON YOU.

751
00:39:15,786 --> 00:39:17,788
FIGG, MAN,
GET OUTTA HERE.

752
00:39:17,788 --> 00:39:18,855
NO WAY!

753
00:39:24,795 --> 00:39:26,696
IT'S NOTHING PERSONAL,
CALVIN.

754
00:39:26,696 --> 00:39:28,899
YEAH, WE LIKE YA.
EVERYONE DOES.

755
00:39:28,899 --> 00:39:30,834
BUT WE'RE GETTIN' PAID.

756
00:39:30,834 --> 00:39:31,868
IT'S BUSINESS.

757
00:39:31,868 --> 00:39:32,003
YOU CAN APPRECIATE THAT.

758
00:39:33,003 --> 00:39:35,739
I MEAN--CAN I
AT LEAST ASK WHY?

759
00:39:35,739 --> 00:39:37,808
IT'S, UH,
PRESTON PRICE.

760
00:39:37,808 --> 00:39:39,176
HE WANTS
YOU AND YOUR DOG

761
00:39:39,176 --> 00:39:41,678
TO STAY AWAY
FROM THAT DOG SHOW.

762
00:39:41,678 --> 00:39:43,180
AND WE'RE SUPPOSED TO,
YOU KNOW,

763
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:44,815
ENCOURAGE YOU TO DROP OUT.

764
00:39:44,815 --> 00:39:45,816
AND YOU KNOW HOW...

765
00:39:45,816 --> 00:39:48,685
PERSUASIVE WE CAN BE.

766
00:39:49,486 --> 00:39:51,822
LOOK, MAN,
NONE OF THIS IS NECESSARY.

767
00:39:51,822 --> 00:39:52,757
TELL PRESTON
I AM TAKING TYCHO

768
00:39:52,757 --> 00:39:54,691
RIGHT BACK TO THE POUND
TODAY AFTER SCHOOL.

769
00:39:54,691 --> 00:39:57,794
LOOK, WE STILL GOTTA POUND ON YOU.
WE'VE ALREADY BEEN PAID.

770
00:39:57,794 --> 00:40:00,230
YEAH. WE GOT ETHICS
AND STUFF.

771
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:01,165
SORRY, CALVIN.

772
00:40:01,165 --> 00:40:02,166
THERE'S NO TALKING YOUR WAY
OUT OF THIS ONE.

773
00:40:02,166 --> 00:40:07,504
SO YOU WANT IT IN THE
FACE OR THE GUT OR WHAT?

774
00:40:12,909 --> 00:40:15,780
SURPRISE ME.

775
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:19,780
WHAT IS THAT?!

776
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:19,182
OHH, NO!

777
00:40:19,182 --> 00:40:19,182
AAH!

778
00:40:23,787 --> 00:40:25,689
OH! MAN! ARE Y'ALL OK?

779
00:40:31,561 --> 00:40:33,864
YOU STUPID DOG!

780
00:40:33,864 --> 00:40:34,030
COME ON, BUDDY! COME ON!

781
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:36,666
HA HA HA!

782
00:40:36,666 --> 00:40:38,535
HEEL!

783
00:40:38,535 --> 00:40:40,839
OHH...

784
00:40:42,839 --> 00:40:45,509
I'VE BEEN MEANING TO FIX THAT GATE FOR MONTHS.

785
00:40:45,509 --> 00:40:47,777
SO LET'S RECAP.

786
00:40:47,777 --> 00:40:49,546
OUR SON IS JUST
SPONTANEOUSLY

787
00:40:49,546 --> 00:40:51,248
DOING WORK AROUND THE HOUSE

788
00:40:51,248 --> 00:40:53,850
WITHOUT EVEN BEING TOLD?

789
00:40:53,850 --> 00:40:56,152
I DON'T THINK
IT'S OUR SON.

790
00:40:56,152 --> 00:40:57,187
HELLO?

791
00:40:57,187 --> 00:40:58,054
YEAH, EMILY?

792
00:40:58,054 --> 00:40:59,656
YEAH, IT'S CALVIN.

793
00:40:59,656 --> 00:41:02,192
YEAH, UH,
SORRY TO CALL SO LATE,

794
00:41:02,192 --> 00:41:03,059
IT'S JUST THAT, UH...

795
00:41:03,059 --> 00:41:06,696
I COULD REALLY USE
SOME HELP WITH TYCHO.

796
00:41:06,696 --> 00:41:09,633
WELL, NOTHING'S
REALLY WRONG.

797
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:10,568
IT'S JUST THAT...

798
00:41:10,568 --> 00:41:14,170
HE'S A LITTLE BIT MORE
THAN I BARGAINED FOR.

799
00:41:14,170 --> 00:41:16,107
OK, OK, SIT.

800
00:41:17,107 --> 00:41:18,909
BAD DOG. BAD--

801
00:41:18,909 --> 00:41:21,678
I SAID SIT!
DO YOU KNOW WHAT SIT MEANS?

802
00:41:21,678 --> 00:41:23,813
YOU CAN'T JUST
YELL AT HIM!

803
00:41:23,813 --> 00:41:25,949
HE'S DOIN' IT WRONG.

804
00:41:25,949 --> 00:41:28,818
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU TRY
TEACHING HIM THE DIFFERENCE?

805
00:41:28,818 --> 00:41:32,255
REWARD HIM WHEN
HE DOES SOMETHING RIGHT.

806
00:41:32,255 --> 00:41:34,791
COME HERE.

807
00:41:34,791 --> 00:41:36,893
COME HERE, TYCHO.
COME HERE.

808
00:41:36,893 --> 00:41:38,828
OH, GOOD BOY!

809
00:41:38,828 --> 00:41:39,996
YEAH, OK.

810
00:41:39,996 --> 00:41:41,765
NOW SIT.

811
00:41:41,765 --> 00:41:42,566
SIT.

812
00:41:42,566 --> 00:41:44,634
YEAH! GOOD BOY!

813
00:41:44,634 --> 00:41:46,069
THAT'S A GOOD BOY.

814
00:41:46,069 --> 00:41:46,069
YEAH.

815
00:41:46,870 --> 00:41:47,003
SO THAT'S IT?

816
00:41:48,003 --> 00:41:49,873
JUST GIVE HIM FOOD?

817
00:41:49,873 --> 00:41:52,909
A DOG NEEDS MORE
THAN JUST FOOD.

818
00:41:52,909 --> 00:41:54,978
YOU HAVE TO GIVE HIM
ENCOURAGEMENT,

819
00:41:54,978 --> 00:41:56,746
PATIENCE, APPROVAL.

820
00:41:56,746 --> 00:42:00,216
AND IF YOU REALLY WANT
A DOG TO RESPOND TO YOU,

821
00:42:00,216 --> 00:42:01,785
YOU HAVE TO GIVE HIM LOVE.

822
00:42:01,785 --> 00:42:04,220

RIGHT. RIGHT.

839
00:42:53,737 --> 00:42:56,840
EMILY, CAN I ASK YOU
A QUESTION?

840
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:57,941
FIRE AWAY.

841
00:42:57,941 --> 00:43:01,244
HOW DID YOU KNOW GOTHAM
MAN'S ARCHENEMY WAS NAMELESS?

842
00:43:01,244 --> 00:43:03,113
DUH. I READ THE COMICS.

843
00:43:03,113 --> 00:43:04,714
<i>YOU READ THEM?</i>

844
00:43:04,714 --> 00:43:08,852
OR DO YOU JUST SKIM
THROUGH THEM SOMETIMES MAYBE?

845
00:43:08,852 --> 00:43:10,320
TEST ME.

846
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:11,288
OK, UH...

847
00:43:11,288 --> 00:43:13,790
THE LICENSE PLATE NUMBER
OF THE GOTHAM-MOBILE.

848
00:43:13,790 --> 00:43:17,394
BEFORE OR AFTER IT GOT TOTALED IN ISSUE 533?

849
00:43:17,394 --> 00:43:18,629
WHAT IS WITH
THE TRICK QUESTIONS?

850
00:43:18,629 --> 00:43:23,801
HAVE YOU EVER JUST BEEN STRAIGHT
UP AND REAL WITH A PERSON?

851
00:43:24,801 --> 00:43:27,737
NO.

852
00:43:27,737 --> 00:43:29,740
NEVER.

853
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:31,474
PAR FOR THE COURSE.

854
00:43:31,474 --> 00:43:32,809
FIGG, I AM TELLING YOU,

855
00:43:32,809 --> 00:43:35,712
EMILY WAS JUST AMAZING
WITH TYCHO TODAY.

856
00:43:35,712 --> 00:43:36,880
DO YOU KNOW WHAT?

857
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:37,981
I THINK WE HAVE
A GOOD CHANCE

858
00:43:37,981 --> 00:43:41,819
OF WINNING THAT OBSTACLE
COURSE EVENT.

859
00:43:42,819 --> 00:43:45,860
MOM'S HOME EARLY.

860
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:52,929
CALVIN, FIGG, STAY OUTSIDE!

861
00:43:52,929 --> 00:43:54,831
THERE'S A BEAR
IN THE HOUSE.

862
00:43:54,831 --> 00:43:57,099
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
I'VE BARRICADED IT IN YOUR ROOM

863
00:43:57,099 --> 00:43:58,101
AND I'M CALLING 911.

864
00:43:58,101 --> 00:44:00,103
MOM, MOM, MOM,
CHILL, CHILL, CH--

865
00:44:00,103 --> 00:44:00,103
SHH!

866
00:44:00,570 --> 00:44:02,739
THAT'S NOT A BEAR.

867
00:44:02,739 --> 00:44:04,040
THAT'S TYCHO.

868
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:06,710
MY DOG.

869
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:08,714
YOUR WHAT?

870
00:44:10,714 --> 00:44:12,716
IT HAS TO GO BACK
TO THE POUND.

871
00:44:12,716 --> 00:44:13,016
NOW, HOLD ON.

872
00:44:14,016 --> 00:44:15,351
I HAD A DOG
WHEN I WAS A KID.

873
00:44:15,351 --> 00:44:17,721
SKINNY LITTLE THING.
FOLLOWED ME HOME ONE DAY.

874
00:44:17,721 --> 00:44:19,322
MY MOM AND DAD
LET ME KEEP IT.

875
00:44:19,322 --> 00:44:22,192
WELL, HONEY,
IT'S VERY SWEET, BUT I JUST...

876
00:44:22,192 --> 00:44:25,762
YOU KNOW... THE FUNNY THING
ABOUT HAVING A DOG--

877
00:44:25,762 --> 00:44:26,030
THEY'RE A REAL PAIN.

878
00:44:27,030 --> 00:44:28,498
DESTROY EVERYTHING IN SIGHT,

879
00:44:28,498 --> 00:44:31,034
PEE ON THE RUG,
SLOBBER EVERYWHERE.

880
00:44:31,034 --> 00:44:32,034
BUT YOU LOVE 'EM ANYWAY.

881
00:44:32,034 --> 00:44:36,039
SO YOU'RE SAYING THIS
WOULD BE GOOD FOR CALVIN.

882
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:38,742
I'M SAYING THAT...

883
00:44:38,742 --> 00:44:42,981
LOVE DOESN'T HAVE
ANY SHORTCUTS.

884
00:44:57,927 --> 00:45:00,397
OK...

885
00:45:01,397 --> 00:45:02,899
TYCHO...

886
00:45:02,899 --> 00:45:04,032
CAN STAY.

887
00:45:04,032 --> 00:45:05,468
REALLY?

888
00:45:05,468 --> 00:45:07,837
YAY! THANK YOU, MOM!
THANK YOU.

889
00:45:07,837 --> 00:45:09,906
THANK YOU, DAD.
THANK YOU.

890
00:45:09,906 --> 00:45:10,740
NOT SO FAST.

891

00:53:18,861 --> 00:53:20,896
THIS IS
AN EVENT THAT FAVORS

1064
00:53:20,896 --> 00:53:23,399
SMALLER, MORE AGILE
ANIMALS, CHUCK.

1065
00:53:23,399 --> 00:53:26,602
UNLESS TYCHO IS A LOT MORE
FLEET OF FOOT THAN HE LOOKS,

1066
00:53:26,602 --> 00:53:28,671
THIS WON'T EVEN BE CLOSE.

1067
00:53:28,671 --> 00:53:31,641
JACQUES AND I ARE GONNA TEACH
YOU AND YOUR MUTT A LESSON.

1068
00:53:31,641 --> 00:53:32,642
WELL, UH...

1069
00:53:32,642 --> 00:53:35,578
I'LL JUST SEE YOU AT THE FINISH LINE, PRESTON.

1070
00:53:35,578 --> 00:53:36,679
DOGS READY.

1071
00:53:39,815 --> 00:53:41,518
HANDLERS READY.

1072
00:53:42,518 --> 00:53:45,656
ON MY MARK...

1073
00:53:46,656 --> 00:53:48,524
GET SET...

1074
00:53:48,524 --> 00:53:49,158
GO.

1075
00:53:49,158 --> 00:53:50,726
JACQUES,
LET'S GO, JACQUES.

1076
00:53:50,726 --> 00:53:52,495
OK. OK, WEAVE, JACQUES.
WEAVE, JACQUES.

1077
00:53:52,495 --> 00:53:54,730
LET'S GO.
WEAVE, JACQUES. GOOD BOY.

1078
00:53:54,730 --> 00:53:57,400
WEAVE. WEAVE, JACQUES.
WEAVE.

1079
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:58,768
OK, COME ON, TYCHO.

1080
00:53:58,768 --> 00:53:59,635
WE CAN BEAT THEM.

1081
00:53:59,635 --> 00:54:01,872
LET'S GO.

1082
00:54:02,872 --> 00:54:04,007
BY GOLLY, HOLLY,

1083
00:54:05,007 --> 00:54:05,007
DID YOU SEE THAT?

1084
00:54:05,875 --> 00:54:07,710
TYCHO IS CRASHING
THROUGH THE OBSTACLES

1085
00:54:07,710 --> 00:54:09,679
LIKE THEY AREN'T EVEN THERE.

1086
00:54:09,679 --> 00:54:13,849
OK, THAT'S COOL.
WE CAN STILL DO IT.

1087
00:54:13,849 --> 00:54:16,719
GO THROUGH. COME ON.
GO THROUGH.

1088
00:54:16,719 --> 00:54:18,754
OHH!

1089
00:54:19,321 --> 00:54:20,623
WE CAN DO IT.
COME ON.

1090
00:54:20,623 --> 00:54:23,059
GO, GO.
GO, GO, GO. OHH!

1091
00:54:23,059 --> 00:54:25,059
OHH!

1092
00:54:23,059 --> 00:54:25,059
OHH!

1093
00:54:23,059 --> 00:54:25,928
OHH!

1094
00:54:25,928 --> 00:54:27,663
THEY'RE TUNNELING
THROUGH RIGHT NOW.

1095
00:54:27,663 --> 00:54:30,399
THAT LITTLE DOG
IS STILL IN THE LEAD.

1096
00:54:30,399 --> 00:54:31,834
HE IS SO CUTE.

1097
00:54:31,834 --> 00:54:34,570
OHH! WHOA! OH!

1098
00:54:35,338 --> 00:54:37,506
AAH, AAH, AAH.
THAT'S MY SHOULDER!

1099
00:54:41,010 --> 00:54:43,112
SPLISH SPLASH,
HE'S TAKIN' A BATH.

1100
00:54:43,112 --> 00:54:44,780
THAT DOG
IS DOING SWIMMINGLY.

1101
00:54:44,780 --> 00:54:46,716
THINK THAT'S THE DOGGIE
PADDLE, CHUCK.

1102
00:54:46,716 --> 00:54:48,784
TYCHO! WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!

1103
00:54:48,784 --> 00:54:50,619
UNH! AAH!

1104
00:54:50,619 --> 00:54:53,054
TYCHO! NOOOO!

1105
00:54:55,524 --> 00:54:59,395
OHH!
HE'S GONNA HAVE TO SHAKE THAT ONE OFF.

1106
00:54:59,395 --> 00:55:00,596
JACQUES!

1107
00:55:00,596 --> 00:55:01,664
GO, TYCHO--OW!

1108
00:55:01,664 --> 00:55:02,398
OHH!

1109
00:55:02,398 --> 00:55:04,867
OH, JACQUES,
ARE YOU OK, JACQUES?

1110
00:55:04,867 --> 00:55:06,435
COME HERE, JACQUES.

1111
00:55:06,435 --> 00:55:07,703
COME ON!

1112
00:55:07,703 --> 00:55:09,038
WHERE'S MY DOG?!

1113
00:55:09,038 --> 00:55:12,375
OH, JACQUES, ARE YOU OK, JACQUES?
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

1114
00:55:12,375 --> 00:55:13,776
ARE YOU OK?

1115
00:55:13,776 --> 00:55:15,776
OHH!

1116
00:55:13,776 --> 00:55:15,478
OK--

1117
00:55:15,478 --> 00:55:17,880
THAT DOG IS FLYING
OFF THE BRIDGE.

1118
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:19,648
TYCHO TAKES THE LEAD.

1119
00:55:21,650 --> 00:55:22,651
OH!

1120
00:55:22,651 --> 00:55:24,754
COME ON, MAN!
COME ON, BABY!

1121
00:55:24,754 --> 00:55:29,027
TYCHO, WAIT!
TYCHO, NO! NO!

1122
00:55:32,027 --> 00:55:32,027
GO, JACQUES.

1123
00:55:32,895 --> 00:55:34,730
JACQUES,
GO, JACQUES.

1124
00:55:44,540 --> 00:55:45,808
COME. HEY, JACQUES.

1125
00:55:47,710 --> 00:55:49,678
THIS IS
AN AWARD-WINNING DOG.

1126
00:55:49,678 --> 00:55:50,579
GET OFF OF MY DOG!

1127
00:55:50,579 --> 00:55:52,648
THEY'RE DIGGIN' UP
SOME TROUBLE NOW, CHUCK.

1128
00:55:52,648 --> 00:55:55,951
IT'S PAN-DOG-MONIUM.

1129
00:55:55,951 --> 00:55:57,787
THIS IS DOGGONE EXCITING.

1130
00:55:57,787 --> 00:56:00,723
A CANINE CATASTROPHE.

1131
00:56:00,723 --> 00:56:03,759
JUDGES, WE HAVE
A VIOLATION. CODE RED!

1132
00:56:03,759 --> 00:56:05,961
THERE'S A RACE GOIN' ON!

1133
00:56:05,961 --> 00:56:07,830
TYCHO, WAIT!

1134
00:56:07,830 --> 00:56:09,832
WAIT FOR ME, TYCHO!

1135
00:56:09,832 --> 00:56:11,834
WAIT! I'M COMIN'!

1136
00:56:13,803 --> 00:56:16,472
TYCHO, COME ON, NOW,
GO INTO THE TUNNEL.

1137
00:56:16,472 --> 00:56:17,640
JACQUES!

1138
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:19,642
ALL RIGHT, TYCHO,
WE GONNA WIN!

1139
00:56:19,642 --> 00:56:21,110
JACQUES--JACQUES--

1140
00:56:21,110 --> 00:56:23,145
NO, GET OUTTA THERE!
DON'T SPIN!

1141
00:56:23,145 --> 00:56:27,583
JACQUES!
JACQUES, COME OUT OF THERE THIS INSTANT!

1142
00:56:27,583 --> 00:56:28,717
HEEL! HEEL!

1143
00:56:28,717 --> 00:56:31,220
DO SOMETHING WITH
THAT MANGY MUTT!

1144
00:56:34,023 --> 00:56:36,659
I THINK HE'S MAKING
HIS WAY TO THE FINISH LINE.

1145
00:56:36,659 --> 00:56:40,965
DRAGGIN' THAT THING
LIKE A DRAGON, ISN'T HE?

1146
00:56:42,965 --> 00:56:44,965
OHH!

1147
00:56:42,965 --> 00:56:44,965
OHH!

1148
00:56:42,965 --> 00:56:44,133
OHH!

1149
00:56:44,133 --> 00:56:45,701
OH HO HO!

1150
00:56:45,701 --> 00:56:46,836
THAT CAN'T BE GOOD.

1151
00:56:46,836 --> 00:56:48,170
JUDGES,
THIS IS AN OUTRAGE!

1152
00:56:48,170 --> 00:56:50,840
JACQUES AND I ARE FILING
AN OFFICIAL PROTEST!

1153
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:52,275
JACQUES!

1154
00:56:52,275 --> 00:56:55,211
HOLLY, IT LOOKS LIKE PRESTON PRICE
HAS LOST CONTROL OF HIS ANIMAL.

1155
00:56:55,211 --> 00:56:59,248
I'VE NEVER SEEN A CHAMPION
THIS FLUSTERED, CHUCK.

1156
00:56:59,248 --> 00:57:00,583
BAD DOG!

1157
00:57:00,583 --> 00:57:02,050
HE'S GOT TO GET
TO THE FINISH LINE.

1158
00:57:02,050 --> 00:57:03,486
HE'S ALMOST THERE!

1159
00:57:03,486 --> 00:57:04,720
OH, YEAH!

1160
00:57:08,858 --> 00:57:09,692
COME ON, TYCHO.
COME ON!

1161
00:57:09,692 --> 00:57:13,662
DON'T STOP MOVIN',
TYCHO, KEEP MOVIN'!

1162
00:57:13,662 --> 00:57:16,932
PLEASE MOVE. JUST PLEASE MOVE.
I'M TRYING TO WIN THE RACE.

1163
00:57:16,932 --> 00:57:18,801
PRESTON PRICE
HAS JUST BEEN HIT

1164
00:57:18,801 --> 00:57:21,270
WITH A PENALTY
FOR CARRYING HIS DOG.

1165
00:57:21,270 --> 00:57:24,173
OH, THAT IS
GOING TO COST THE CHAMP.

1166
00:57:24,173 --> 00:57:26,108
COME ON! COME ON!

1167
00:57:28,944 --> 00:57:30,846
WHOA!

1168
00:57:30,846 --> 00:57:32,088
WHOO-HOO!

1169
00:57:40,088 --> 00:57:42,992
♪ VICTORY IS OURS,
VICTORY IS OURS ♪

1170
00:57:42,992 --> 00:57:46,729
OK, CHUCK,
IT'S GOING TO TAKE THE JUDGES SOME TIME

1171
00:57:46,729 --> 00:57:47,697
TO TALLY UP ALL THOSE
PENALTIES HERE.

1172
00:57:47,697 --> 00:57:50,966
LOOKS LIKE WE'RE FINALLY
GOING TO GET A RULING

1173
00:57:50,966 --> 00:57:52,669
FROM THE HEAD JUDGE.

1174
00:57:53,669 --> 00:57:55,738
THE DOG IN LANE 2,

1175
00:57:55,738 --> 00:57:56,706
TYCHO,

1176
00:57:56,706 --> 00:57:59,842
COMPLETED THE COURSE
IN ONE MINUTE, 37 SECONDS.

1177
00:57:59,842 --> 00:58:02,745
AFTER CALCULATING
THE TIME PENALTIES

1178
00:58:02,745 --> 00:58:06,849
ASSESSED FOR MISSING
EVERY SINGLE OBSTACLE,

1179
00:58:06,849 --> 00:58:08,617
THE FINAL TIME

1180
00:58:08,617 --> 00:58:11,587
IS 2 MINUTES AND 6 SECONDS.

1181
00:58:11,587 --> 00:58:12,821
UNBELIEVABLE!

1182
00:58:12,821 --> 00:58:15,190
CALVIN WHEELER
AND HIS DOG TYCHO

1183
00:58:15,190 --> 00:58:16,859
HAVE JUST SET
A NEW COURSE RECORD.

1184
00:58:16,859 --> 00:58:20,729
WITH SOME VERY UNORTHODOX STRATEGY,
I MIGHT ADD.

1185
00:58:20,729 --> 00:58:24,099
JUST LISTEN. THE CROWD
IS BEGGING FOR MORE.

1186
00:58:25,301 --> 00:58:26,469
IT'S NOT FAIR.
HE CHEATED.

1187
00:58:26,469 --> 00:58:29,605
HE CAN'T JUST SMASH THROUGH
OBSTACLES LIKE THAT. COME ON.

1188
00:58:29,605 --> 00:58:33,074
THE WINNER IS
CALVIN WHEELER AND TYCHO.

1189
00:58:33,074 --> 00:58:36,712
OHH! OHH!

1190
00:58:36,712 --> 00:58:38,214
YEAH! HA HA!

1191
00:58:39,214 --> 00:58:40,316
THAT FIRST-PLACE FINISH

1192
00:58:40,316 --> 00:58:42,751
IS GOING TO SECURE
THIS UNKNOWN DOG

1193
00:58:42,751 --> 00:58:45,888
AN INVITATION TO THE TOP
DOG FINALS NEXT WEEKEND.

1194
00:58:45,888 --> 00:58:48,791
CALVIN WHEELER
AND HIS DOG TYCHO

1195
00:58:48,791 --> 00:58:50,759
HAVE JUST SHOCKED
THE DOG SHOW WORLD.

1196
00:58:50,759 --> 00:58:51,860
I'M CHUCK.

1197
00:58:51,860 --> 00:58:52,962
AND I'M HOLLY.

1198
00:58:52,962 --> 00:58:54,863
BOW-WOW FOR NOW.

1199
00:58:54,863 --> 00:58:56,365
TELL US HOW YOU FEEL!

1200
00:58:56,365 --> 00:58:57,065
WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS?

1201
00:58:57,065 --> 00:59:00,669
OK, OK. PLEASE,
ONE AT A TIME.

1202
00:59:00,669 --> 00:59:01,670
YOU.

1203
00:59:01,670 --> 00:59:03,606
<i>CHARLES NETWORTH,
PERFECT POOCHIE MONTHLY.</i>

1204
00:59:03,606 --> 00:59:05,975
SOME MEMBERS OF THE CANINE
PRESS CORPS HAVE ALREADY

1205
00:59:05,975 --> 00:59:08,877
CALLED YOUR DOG
TYCHO THE TERRIBLE.

1206
00:59:09,645 --> 00:59:10,479
WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF THE NICKNAME?

1207
00:59:10,479 --> 00:59:13,282
WELL, UH--HA HA--
IF THE SHOE FITS...

1208
00:59:13,282 --> 00:59:15,351
GET IT, THE SHOE?

1209
00:59:16,785 --> 00:59:17,820
<i>MANDY CALL,
FANCY CANINE.</i>

1210
00:59:17,820 --> 00:59:20,723
CALVIN, YOU AND TYCHO
HAVE NOW QUALIFIED TO ENTER

1211
00:59:20,723 --> 00:59:21,724
THE TOP DOG FINALS.

1212
00:59:21,724 --> 00:59:24,393
TWO-TIME DEFENDING CHAMP
PRESTON PRICE SAYS THAT

1213
00:59:24,393 --> 00:59:27,630
HE WILL BE
IMPOSSIBLE TO BEAT.

1214
00:59:27,630 --> 00:59:28,897
ANY RESPONSE?

1215
00:59:36,205 --> 00:59:37,139
UM...

1216
00:59:37,139 --> 00:59:39,708
EXPECT THE IMPOSSIBLE.

1217
00:59:39,708 --> 00:59:41,410
THAT'S GREAT.

1218
00:59:49,885 --> 00:59:52,862
HELP ME OUT, FIGG.

1219
01:00:00,996 --> 01:00:02,831
NO PROBLEM.

1220
01:00:02,831 --> 01:00:06,902
CAN I ASK YOU
A QUESTION?

1221
01:00:06,902 --> 01:00:07,703
OK.

1222
01:00:07,703 --> 01:00:08,771
WHAT'S THE DEAL
WITH YOU AND CALVIN?

1223
01:00:08,771 --> 01:00:13,943
I MEAN,
YOU FOLLOW HIM AROUND LIKE YOU'RE A SERVANT.

1224
01:00:14,943 --> 01:00:16,412
WHEN I FIRST MOVED HERE,

1225
01:00:16,412 --> 01:00:20,282
KIDS MADE FUN OF ME, YOU KNOW,
'CAUSE I HAVE ASTHMA.

1226
01:00:20,282 --> 01:00:21,817
AND CALVIN DIDN'T?

1227
01:00:21,817 --> 01:00:23,085
NO, HE DID.

1228
01:00:23,085 --> 01:00:26,689
HE WAS THE WORST ACTUALLY.

1229
01:00:26,689 --> 01:00:27,423
BUT WHY--

1230
01:00:27,423 --> 01:00:28,524
DO YOU REMEMBER
IN SECOND GRADE,

1231
01:00:28,524 --> 01:00:30,993
WHEN I HAD THAT REALLY BAD
ASTHMA ATTACK DURING RECESS?

1232
01:00:30,993 --> 01:00:31,894
OH, YEAH!

1233
01:00:31,894 --> 01:00:33,729
THEY CALLED THE AMBULANCE
AND EVERYTHING.

1234
01:00:33,729 --> 01:00:35,931
YEAH. I FORGOT
MY INHALER THAT DAY.

1235
01:00:35,931 --> 01:00:37,766
I JUST COULDN'T BREATHE.

1236
01:00:37,766 --> 01:00:42,237
EVERYBODY WAS STANDING AROUND
STARING AT ME.

1237
01:00:42,237 --> 01:00:45,774
THE KIDS AND THE TEACHERS.

1238
01:00:45,774 --> 01:00:47,041
BUT NOT CALVIN.

1239
01:00:47,041 --> 01:00:52,081
HE REMEMBERED THAT MR.
AGATHAPALS, THE JANITOR, ALSO HAD ASTHMA.

1240
01:00:52,081 --> 01:00:55,884
CALVIN RAN INSIDE,
GOT HIS INHALER AND BROUGHT IT TO ME.

1241
01:00:55,884 --> 01:00:58,921
CAME AND SAW ME EVERY DAY
WHILE I WAS IN THE HOSPITAL.

1242
01:00:58,921 --> 01:01:00,389
READ ME COMIC BOOKS.

1243
01:01:00,389 --> 01:01:02,758
<i>LET ME GUESS.
GOTHAM MAN.</i>

1244
01:01:02,758 --> 01:01:04,059
<i>GOTHAM MAN.</i>

1245
01:01:04,059 --> 01:01:07,498
<i>DARK DRAGON CHRONICLES.</i>

1246
01:01:09,498 --> 01:01:12,101
SO THERE REALLY IS A HEART OF GOLD IN THERE.

1247
01:01:12,101 --> 01:01:15,204
YEAH. IT'S JUST DEEP.

1248
01:01:15,204 --> 01:01:18,842
DEEP DOWN SOMETIMES.

1249
01:01:23,245 --> 01:01:25,014
HEY! I'M HERE
FOR THE FOLLOW-UP INTERVIEW.

1250
01:01:26,014 --> 01:01:30,853
AHH. WE'VE BEEN
EXPECTING YOU.

1251
01:01:30,853 --> 01:01:32,154
PLEASE...

1252
01:01:32,154 --> 01:01:35,061
HAVE A SEAT.

1253
01:01:39,061 --> 01:01:40,295
WHERE'S TYCHO?

1254
01:01:40,295 --> 01:01:42,364
THIS IS ABOUT HIM,
REMEMBER?

1255
01:01:47,770 --> 01:01:49,171
GOOD JOB!

1256
01:01:49,171 --> 01:01:50,539
HERE WE ARE.

1257
01:01:50,539 --> 01:01:52,808
AHH. LUNCH IS SERVED.

1258
01:01:52,808 --> 01:01:54,843
THANK YOU, TYCHO.

1259
01:01:55,544 --> 01:01:56,779
THANK YOU, CALVIN.

1260
01:01:56,779 --> 01:01:58,782
YEAH,
THANK YOU, TYCHO.

1261
01:01:59,782 --> 01:02:02,484
I MEAN,
YOU'RE JOKING, RIGHT?

1262
01:02:02,484 --> 01:02:04,020
<i>YOU DON'T HONESTLY THINK
THAT AVENGING ANGIE</i>

1263
01:02:05,020 --> 01:02:06,555
<i>IS A BETTER COMIC
THAN GOTHAM MAN?</i>

1264
01:02:06,555 --> 01:02:10,459
COME ON. BETTER ARTWORK,
BETTER STORYLINES,

1265
01:02:10,459 --> 01:02:11,027
MORE COMPLEX CHARACTERS.

1266
01:02:12,027 --> 01:02:13,295
LISTEN, LADY, OK?

1267
01:02:13,295 --> 01:02:14,797
<i>GOTHAM MAN IS
AN ICON.</i>

1268
01:02:14,797 --> 01:02:16,799
YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU'RE
JUST LUCKY THAT I'M HERE

1269
01:02:16,799 --> 01:02:19,401
TO EVALUATE YOUR
QUALIFICATIONS AS A DOG OWNER

1270
01:02:19,401 --> 01:02:23,173
AND NOT YOUR TASTE IN COMICS.

1271
01:02:25,140 --> 01:02:26,809
OR YOUR VIDEOGAME SKILLS.

1272
01:02:26,809 --> 01:02:28,477
THAT WAS LUCK.

1273
01:02:28,477 --> 01:02:29,912
YOU KNOW IT.

1274
01:02:29,912 --> 01:02:31,947
SEE YOU LATER.

1275
01:02:31,947 --> 01:02:36,285
UM, EMILY, UM...

1276
01:02:36,285 --> 01:02:38,520
THE SPRING DANCE
IS NEXT WEEK.

1277
01:02:38,520 --> 01:02:41,156
I WAS JUST WONDERING

1278
01:02:41,156 --> 01:02:43,192
IF YOU WANTED TO GO.

1279
01:02:43,192 --> 01:02:44,526
I MEAN...

1280
01:02:44,526 --> 01:02:47,496
WITH ME.

1281
01:02:47,496 --> 01:02:50,532
YOU HAVE VERY IMPRESSIVE
QUALIFICATIONS, CALVIN.

1282
01:02:50,532 --> 01:02:53,202
I DO HAVE ONE QUESTION
FOR YOU, HOWEVER.

1283
01:02:53,202 --> 01:02:54,504
OH, YEAH, SURE,
ANYTHING.

1284
01:02:54,504 --> 01:02:59,875
DO YOU LOOK SPECTACULAR
IN ALL SPRING COLORS?

1285
01:02:59,875 --> 01:03:02,211
THAT'S A TRICK QUESTION
AND, UH...

1286
01:03:02,211 --> 01:03:03,612
YOU KNOW I DO.

1287
01:03:03,612 --> 01:03:04,613
PICK ME UP AT 8:00 THEN.

1288
01:03:04,613 --> 01:03:07,983
BUT STILL, WE'RE LOOKING
FOR A FANTASTIC WEEKEND.

1289
01:03:07,983 --> 01:03:10,886
THE TOP DOG FINAL,
PRESENTED BY ROYAL...

1290
01:03:10,886 --> 01:03:11,920
OH, WELL, YOU KNOW---

1291
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:14,890
NO, NO, NO, NO.
STOP.

1292
01:03:14,890 --> 01:03:16,192
COMES UP TOMORROW AT 3 p.m.

1293
01:03:16,192 --> 01:03:19,294
TWO-TIME DEFENDING CHAMPION
PRESTON PRICE SAYS HIS DOG JACQUES...

1294
01:03:19,294 --> 01:03:20,896
OF COURSE IT WOULD
BE HIM.

1295
01:03:20,896 --> 01:03:21,897
WILL TAKE ON THE NEWCOMER
CALVIN WHEELER

1296
01:03:21,897 --> 01:03:26,335
AND HIS DOG TYCHO, OR AS
SOME ARE CALLING HIM...

1297
01:03:26,335 --> 01:03:27,436
I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN.

1298
01:03:27,436 --> 01:03:30,138
THANK YOU, JIM.
IN LOCAL NEWS...

1299
01:03:30,138 --> 01:03:31,440
EMILY.

1300
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:32,875
EMILY, WAIT.

1301
01:03:32,875 --> 01:03:36,245
YOU KNOW WHAT?
LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING.

1302
01:03:36,245 --> 01:03:37,480
WHAT WERE YOU GOING
TO DO WITH TYCHO

1303
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:40,883
<i>AFTER YOU WERE DONE
USING HIM TO MAKE YOUR MONEY?</i>

1304
01:03:40,883 --> 01:03:41,984
TAKE HIM BACK TO THE SHELTER?

1305
01:03:41,984 --> 01:03:44,953
LOOK, NO, NO, NO.
THAT WAS JUST THE WAY IT STARTED.

1306
01:03:44,953 --> 01:03:48,624
OH, BUT WAIT.
YOU'VE CHANGED.

1307
01:03:48,624 --> 01:03:49,725
YES.

1308
01:03:49,725 --> 01:03:51,660
NOW YOU HAVE A HEART OF GOLD
AND YOU REALLY LOVE TYCHO.

1309
01:03:51,660 --> 01:03:54,263
THAT'S IT.
THAT'S RIGHT.

1310
01:03:54,263 --> 01:03:55,597
THAT IS EXACTLY RIGHT.

1311
01:03:55,597 --> 01:03:57,132
THEN PROVE IT.

1312
01:03:57,132 --> 01:03:59,635
DON'T ENTER HIM
IN THAT SHOW.

1313
01:03:59,635 --> 01:04:02,572
DROP OUT NOW.

1314
01:04:03,572 --> 01:04:05,476
GOOD-BYE, CALVIN.

1315
01:04:07,476 --> 01:04:10,512
CALVIN!

1316
01:04:10,512 --> 01:04:12,248
HEY, EMILY.

1317
01:04:13,248 --> 01:04:16,919
WE HAVE A PROBLEM.

1318
01:04:16,919 --> 01:04:17,653
TYCHO HAS A HOME.

1319
01:04:17,653 --> 01:04:18,754
HE HAS A FAMILY
THAT MISSES HIM.

1320
01:04:18,754 --> 01:04:22,324
LOOK. THEY'RE EVEN OFFERING
A REWARD TO GET HIM BACK.

1321
01:04:22,324 --> 01:04:24,092
HOW MANY FLYERS
DID YOU SEE?

1322
01:04:24,092 --> 01:04:26,261
THEY'RE EVERYWHERE.
THEY'RE ALL OVER THE TOWN.

1323
01:04:28,063 --> 01:04:29,598
TAKE THEM ALL DOWN.

1324
01:04:29,598 --> 01:04:31,667
WHAT?

1325
01:04:31,667 --> 01:04:34,136
I'M--I'M NOT
LOSING TYCHO.

1326
01:04:34,136 --> 01:04:35,637
NOT NOW.

1327
01:04:35,637 --> 01:04:37,973
CALVIN, THIS IS HIS HOME.

1328
01:04:37,973 --> 01:04:40,375
HIS REAL HOME
WHERE HE BELONGS.

1329
01:04:40,375 --> 01:04:41,343
SAYS WHO?

1330
01:04:41,343 --> 01:04:42,711
CALVIN, LOOK AT IT THIS WAY.

1331
01:04:42,711 --> 01:04:46,381
IF YOU LOST TYCHO,
YOU'D WANT HIM BACK, RIGHT?

1332
01:04:46,381 --> 01:04:48,250
JUST DO IT, FIGG!

1333
01:04:48,250 --> 01:04:50,562
NOW.

1334
01:05:00,562 --> 01:05:02,497
NO.

1335
01:05:02,497 --> 01:05:03,632
WHAT?

1336
01:05:04,499 --> 01:05:06,568
WHAT DID YOU
SAY TO ME?

1337
01:05:06,568 --> 01:05:07,703
"HE'S SELFISH.

1338
01:05:07,703 --> 01:05:09,371
HE ONLY CARES ABOUT HIMSELF."

1339
01:05:09,371 --> 01:05:11,573
THAT'S WHAT THEY ALL
SAY ABOUT YOU, CALVIN.

1340
01:05:11,573 --> 01:05:15,577
BUT I NEVER THOUGHT
THAT THEY WERE RIGHT.

1341
01:05:15,577 --> 01:05:18,159
TILL NOW.

1342
01:05:31,159 --> 01:05:34,529
I WANT TO KEEP TYCHO
MORE THAN ANYTHING.

1343
01:05:37,466 --> 01:05:41,117
I KNOW YOU'LL DO
THE RIGHT THING, SON.

1344
01:06:02,491 --> 01:06:06,695
UM... YEAH, I HAVE YOUR DOG.

1345
01:06:06,695 --> 01:06:10,265
GREAT.
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

1346
01:06:10,265 --> 01:06:12,534
LOOK, HONEY!
IT'S CHESTER!

1347
01:06:13,568 --> 01:06:14,436
CHESTER.

1348
01:06:14,436 --> 01:06:16,038
OH, LOOK.

1349
01:06:16,038 --> 01:06:19,207
CHESTER! COME HERE, HONEY.

1350
01:06:19,207 --> 01:06:21,209
COME GIVE MAMA A KISS.

1351
01:06:21,743 --> 01:06:23,178
HA HA HA HA.
HA HA.

1352
01:06:23,178 --> 01:06:24,579
GO ON, TYCHO.

1353
01:06:24,579 --> 01:06:26,482
I MEAN...

1354
01:06:27,482 --> 01:06:28,650
CHESTER.

1355
01:06:29,684 --> 01:06:31,153
THANK YOU.

1356
01:06:31,153 --> 01:06:34,088
FOR BRINGING HIM
HOME TO US.

1357
01:06:34,088 --> 01:06:35,757
BILLY, GO GET THE REWARD.

1358
01:06:35,757 --> 01:06:37,659
NO, NO, NO.

1359
01:06:37,659 --> 01:06:38,794
KEEP THE MONEY. I--

1360
01:06:38,794 --> 01:06:40,228
I DON'T WANT IT.

1361
01:06:40,228 --> 01:06:45,333
JUST PROMISE ME
YOU'LL TAKE GOOD CARE OF HIM.

1362
01:06:45,333 --> 01:06:47,669
YEAH, SURE.
NO PROBLEM.

1363
01:06:57,579 --> 01:06:59,214
STAY.

1364
01:06:59,214 --> 01:07:00,849
YOU HEAR ME?

1365
01:07:02,484 --> 01:07:04,586
STAY.

1366
01:07:55,837 --> 01:07:56,671
HEY.

1367
01:07:56,671 --> 01:08:00,809
HEY, WHERE'S TYCHO?

1368
01:08:00,809 --> 01:08:02,645
UM...

1369
01:08:03,645 --> 01:08:05,147
I TOOK HIM HOME.

1370
01:08:05,147 --> 01:08:09,753
BUT THE TOP DOG FINALS
IS TODAY.

1371
01:08:11,753 --> 01:08:13,493
I KNOW.

1372
01:08:18,493 --> 01:08:20,664
EMILY!

1373
01:08:22,664 --> 01:08:23,632
HEY!

1374
01:08:23,632 --> 01:08:24,733
GET OUT OF HERE.

1375
01:08:24,733 --> 01:08:26,735
I WANT YOU
TO KNOW SOMETHING.

1376
01:08:26,735 --> 01:08:29,671
CALVIN GAVE TYCHO BACK
TO HIS REAL FAMILY

1377
01:08:29,671 --> 01:08:31,706
AND DIDN'T ACCEPT A REWARD.

1378
01:08:31,706 --> 01:08:32,807
WAIT A MINUTE.

1379
01:08:32,807 --> 01:08:35,343
YEAH.
YOU CAN SAY A LOT OF BAD THINGS ABOUT CALVIN.

1380
01:08:35,343 --> 01:08:36,311
THEY'RE PROBABLY TRUE,

1381
01:08:36,311 --> 01:08:38,947
BUT YOU CAN'T SAY HE DOESN'T LOVE THAT DOG.

1382
01:08:38,947 --> 01:08:42,384
THIS PHOTO OF TYCHO,
I TOOK IT.

1383
01:08:42,384 --> 01:08:43,518
NO, IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

1384
01:08:43,518 --> 01:08:45,453
THAT WAS TAKEN
BY HIS REAL FAMILY.

1385
01:08:45,453 --> 01:08:47,590
UNH-UNH. LOOK.

1386
01:08:48,590 --> 01:08:51,893
I TOOK THIS PHOTO WHEN THEY FIRST
BROUGHT TYCHO INTO THE SHELTER.

1387
01:08:51,893 --> 01:08:53,060
BUT--BUT THAT MEANS THAT

1388
01:08:53,060 --> 01:08:57,500
THIS FLYER COULDN'T HAVE
BEEN PUT UP BY TYCHO'S FAMILY.

1389
01:08:58,500 --> 01:09:00,305
SOMETHING'S NOT RIGHT.

1390
01:09:03,305 --> 01:09:04,473
CALVIN!

1391
01:09:05,473 --> 01:09:07,776
WHAT'S UP, FIGG?

1392
01:09:07,776 --> 01:09:10,615
LOOK AT THIS.

1393
01:09:13,615 --> 01:09:15,717
IT WAS PRESTON!

1394
01:09:15,717 --> 01:09:16,718
YOU KNOW WHAT?

1395
01:09:16,718 --> 01:09:18,954
HE MADE UP THOSE FLYERS
AND POSTED THEM HIMSELF.

1396
01:09:18,954 --> 01:09:20,622
HE DID IT ALL.

1397
01:09:20,622 --> 01:09:22,390
HE KNEW HOW MUCH
I CARED ABOUT TYCHO,

1398
01:09:22,390 --> 01:09:24,926
HOW MUCH I WANTED TO DO
WHAT WAS BEST FOR HIM

1399
01:09:24,926 --> 01:09:26,828
AND GET HIM BACK
TO HIS REAL FAMILY.

1400
01:09:26,828 --> 01:09:28,563
EXCEPT THEY'RE NOT
HIS REAL FAMILY.

1401
01:09:28,563 --> 01:09:29,731
THEY'RE PHONIES!

1402
01:09:29,731 --> 01:09:30,699
SO WHO ARE THEY?

1403
01:09:30,699 --> 01:09:32,500
THEY HAD TO BE SOMEBODY
PRESTON COULD CONTROL.

1404
01:09:32,500 --> 01:09:34,502
NOT THERE,
YOU DUFUS.

1405
01:09:34,502 --> 01:09:37,239
I KNEW THAT GUY
LOOKED FAMILIAR!

1406
01:09:37,239 --> 01:09:38,773
SO WHAT NOW?

1407
01:09:38,773 --> 01:09:40,242
NOW WE GET HIM BACK!

1408
01:09:43,845 --> 01:09:45,651
THAT'S TYCHO.

1409
01:09:52,454 --> 01:09:53,389
OH, MY GOODNESS.

1410
