1
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,750
I'll tell you
what I know.

2
00:02:28,834 --> 00:02:30,792
Most of it, I was there for.

3
00:02:30,875 --> 00:02:33,709
Some of it's the way
I heard later.

4
00:02:33,792 --> 00:02:36,041
The rest is just the way
I figure it happened.

5
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:48,959
-He's gaining on us.
-I'm flooring it!

6
00:02:49,041 --> 00:02:50,625
This motherfucker
is gaining on us!

7
00:02:50,709 --> 00:02:52,375
I got it wide open.

8
00:02:53,542 --> 00:02:55,583
Ned, we're not gonna
make it, are we?

9
00:02:55,667 --> 00:02:58,250
-Are we?
-No.

10
00:02:58,333 --> 00:03:00,083
I don't want to go down
like this.

11
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:01,834
It's over, Jude.

12
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,125
Uhh!

13
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:23,000
Ned!

14
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:14,375
Dr. Ugida to Cardiology.

15
00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:16,834
Dr. Ugida to Cardiology.

16
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,500
If you do go in,
don't be too long.

17
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:27,041
Jesus, you
look like shit.

18
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:29,417
I mean, no offense.
You really look bad.

19
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,750
I heard they dumped you
on the road,

20
00:04:30,834 --> 00:04:32,542
I figured, "All right,
so you got fucked up,"

21
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:33,750
but you look like shit.

22
00:04:33,834 --> 00:04:35,333
Who are you?

23
00:04:35,417 --> 00:04:38,333
Habbish, your lawyer,
court-appointed.

24
00:04:38,417 --> 00:04:40,000
You know,
if you don't have
or can't afford,

25
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:41,834
then one will
be appointed for you.
Well, I'm the one.

26
00:04:41,917 --> 00:04:43,000
Is that swelling
gonna go down?

27
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:44,917
-Leave.
-Leave?

28
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,709
What? Are you kidding?
Representing you

29
00:04:46,792 --> 00:04:48,375
makes me a celebrity
by association.

30
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:50,583
This is a small town,
Mr. Tash,

31
00:04:50,667 --> 00:04:52,208
and you're the biggest thing
to happen around here

32
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:54,125
since old lady
Washington went crazy,
stripped naked,

33
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:55,792
and spent 45 minutes
on her roof singing,

34
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:57,625
"Daddy, Don't You
Walk So Fast,"
and that was what?

35
00:04:57,709 --> 00:05:00,125
That was like back in, uh...
I don't know, like '80, '83.

36
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:03,041
-Are you gonna
eat that Jell-O?
-What do you want?

37
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:04,792
Well, you got
a hearing scheduled,

38
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:06,458
so we gotta
figure out how
you want to plea.

39
00:05:06,542 --> 00:05:08,125
I didn't do anything.

40
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:10,417
Well, there
are three dead bodies
that will say otherwise.

41
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,625
I didn't kill those people.

42
00:05:11,709 --> 00:05:14,375
Look, when
we go to court,

43
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:17,208
you can lie to
the judge, the jury,
Buddha, God,

44
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:19,709
your crystals,
whatever you believe in,
but I'm your lawyer.

45
00:05:19,792 --> 00:05:22,041
I'm the one that you
tell the truth to,
all right?

46
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:24,458
That is if you're not
too tired of living.

47
00:05:24,542 --> 00:05:27,792
So, why'd you do it?

48
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,959
You know, I went down
to the crime scene
to have a look around.

49
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:53,625
I was fascinated.
Like I said,

50
00:05:53,709 --> 00:05:55,583
this kind of thing
just doesn't
happen around here.

51
00:05:55,667 --> 00:05:57,625
So, anyway, so I'm
down there, you know.
I'm looking around,

52
00:05:57,709 --> 00:06:00,750
and after I get done vomiting,
I ask myself,

53
00:06:00,834 --> 00:06:04,667
"What kind of a sick
fuck gets involved with
something like this?"

54
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:07,458
You know, the jewelry,
that I can understand,
but the rest,

55
00:06:07,542 --> 00:06:09,250
what was it, Tash?

56
00:06:10,417 --> 00:06:12,458
What makes a man
go so wrong?

57
00:06:18,417 --> 00:06:21,375
Oh, come on.
Come on now. What?

58
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:23,709
-I was just thinking.
-What?

59
00:06:23,792 --> 00:06:26,291
What if God and Jeannie
got in a fight?

60
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:29,125
Who?

61
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:31,875
You know the genie
from I Dream of Jeannie?

62
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:34,709
What if she got
in a fight with God.
Isn't that funny?

63
00:06:34,792 --> 00:06:36,583
Isn't that funny?

64
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:39,875
-What?
-You motherfucker.

65
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:43,375
You're doing it
again, Jude.

66
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:46,000
-What?
-You're laughing in bed.

67
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:47,709
Oh, I wasn't laughing
at you.

68
00:06:47,792 --> 00:06:49,542
You weren't
thinking about me.

69
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:51,166
Of course I was
thinking of you.

70
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:52,709
I'm always thinking of you.

71
00:06:52,792 --> 00:06:54,458
Sometimes my head
is so full of you

72
00:06:54,542 --> 00:06:57,208
I think the only way
to empty it is
by killing myself.

73
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:58,917
You want to hear
something funny?

74
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,667
You want to hear
something funny?

75
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:03,250
You and me together,
that's funny.

76
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:06,250
Jesus, I was just kidding.

77
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:09,667
Relax a little, would you?
You are-- you are so tense.

78
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,083
Let's do it again.

79
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:18,417
Shit. No.

80
00:07:19,834 --> 00:07:22,500
One more time?
I want it to be perfect.

81
00:07:29,834 --> 00:07:33,000
Hit the shop at 2:30,
slowest part of the day,

82
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:35,583
only three employees,
smash and grab,

83
00:07:35,667 --> 00:07:39,291
gives the cops only
three minutes to respond.

84
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:43,417
No security cameras,
no fancy alarms.
Small towns...

85
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,959
These people would smile
at you while you're stealing
their teeth,

86
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:47,583
and they'll point out
the ones you missed.

87
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:49,583
We take what we want,
and we head back west.

88
00:07:49,667 --> 00:07:51,792
Mm-mm. Mm-mm.
No back west.

89
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:53,417
The most depressing year
of my life.

90
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,458
-I'm not going back there.
-We have to.

91
00:07:55,542 --> 00:07:57,291
There's a guy there that can
fence this stuff for us.

92
00:07:57,375 --> 00:07:59,291
It's not like moving
color TVs.

93
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:00,875
You know, there's only
a handful of guys in this
part of the country

94
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:02,709
that can handle
what we're bringing in.

95
00:08:02,792 --> 00:08:04,375
You made it there a year.
You can stand it--

96
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:05,959
-It's gonna rain tomorrow.
-It will not rain!

97
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:07,959
It's going to
fucking rain tomorrow!

98
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:09,792
I'm not doing a job
in the rain.

99
00:08:09,875 --> 00:08:12,041
Too many things
can go wrong, so put it
out of your mind.

100
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:13,583
And we should
do what instead?

101
00:08:13,667 --> 00:08:15,458
Whatever we want.
We've got the money.

102
00:08:15,542 --> 00:08:17,959
-It's not enough.
-We've got enough
to get started.

103
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:21,458
Everything that
we've talked about,
we have enough money.

104
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:23,291
And then what?

105
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:26,667
Find what? Some job?
Punch a clock?

106
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:29,333
Do my eight and go home
to four gray walls?

107
00:08:29,417 --> 00:08:30,834
Ha! No, thanks.

108
00:08:30,917 --> 00:08:33,083
I've tried that.
It's too slow.

109
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:36,500
Ned, $250,000, that's
what we're talking about,

110
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:38,125
a quarter of a million
sitting no place--

111
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:40,458
And then?
That's it, right? The end.

112
00:08:40,542 --> 00:08:41,667
$250,000.

113
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,166
Nothing will go wrong.

114
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:45,583
After this,
we walk away for good.

115
00:08:45,667 --> 00:08:48,166
-That's it, right? The end.
-Do this for me.

116
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:49,625
It's once in a lifetime.

117
00:08:49,709 --> 00:08:52,583
Just you and me,
straight down the line.

118
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,500
Well, let's do it
one more time.

119
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:06,500
She's no good.
Rotten like garbage in July.

120
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:09,125
-Mm-hm. I know.
-Mmm.

121
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:10,959
Well, now, but not then.

122
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:13,166
No. I knew she was
no good then, too.

123
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:16,208
It didn't matter.
I left Brice
to be with Jude.

124
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:18,208
-Brice?
-My ex.

125
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:22,000
She put a bullet in Jude's leg
as a going-away present.

126
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:23,709
We're tied together
like that.

127
00:09:23,792 --> 00:09:27,458
Jude is smart, tough,
good in bed.

128
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:31,625
Great in bed.

129
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:34,375
And good with a gun.

130
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:37,000
A woman like that
is just about perfect.

131
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:41,125
Sure, and why give her up
just 'cause she's crazy?

132
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:45,208
-How bad is it?
-Armed robbery, triple homicide.

133
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:48,333
Hell, getting dumped on the
highway probably violates
three traffic laws.

134
00:09:48,417 --> 00:09:49,750
You'll get
the death penalty.

135
00:09:49,834 --> 00:09:51,583
I figure you got, what?
Eight years to live.

136
00:09:51,667 --> 00:09:53,083
Thank God for appeals, huh?

137
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:54,834
Anything else
I can get you?

138
00:09:57,333 --> 00:09:59,041
A phone.

139
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:00,583
A phone I can do.

140
00:10:01,792 --> 00:10:04,333
I don't know
who you're calling,

141
00:10:04,417 --> 00:10:05,792
but unless it's God...

142
00:10:06,834 --> 00:10:08,417
...I wouldn't waste the dime.

143
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:35,583
You want something?

144
00:10:35,667 --> 00:10:38,458
Johnny Costello--
he around?

145
00:10:38,542 --> 00:10:40,875
Johnny Coke Bottles?

146
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:42,709
No. He ain't here.

147
00:10:42,792 --> 00:10:46,041
I-- I was supposed
to meet him.

148
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:47,959
I guess it don't matter.
He ain't here.

149
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:50,792
What time
will he be back?

150
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:52,959
Four days.
I don't know, maybe five.

151
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:54,959
Days? What do you
mean, days?

152
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:57,625
I was supposed
to meet him today, now.

153
00:10:57,709 --> 00:10:59,875
Yeah. You said.

154
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:01,792
I said he ain't here!

155
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:03,792
Where the hell
did he go?

156
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:06,041
Look, I ain't
his fucking secretary!

157
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,417
God!

158
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:14,542
I gave him a sedative.
He'll sleep for a while.

159
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:37,750
Open the door!

160
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,250
Damn you, Tash!
What are you doing?

161
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:43,875
Open this door!

162
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,125
Uhh!

163
00:11:57,375 --> 00:11:59,792
It's in the back,
so it's quiet.

164
00:12:00,792 --> 00:12:02,291
You've got your privacy.

165
00:12:05,417 --> 00:12:07,625
That's the bedroom.

166
00:12:07,709 --> 00:12:10,834
Clean. But you can see that.

167
00:12:10,917 --> 00:12:13,875
Got a kitchenette.
Clean, too.

168
00:12:13,959 --> 00:12:16,291
I don't rent a hole
in a wall.

169
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:20,000
Most people rent
their rooms out cheap

170
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:21,667
wouldn't
take care of them.

171
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,458
Just 'cause they're cheap
don't mean they can't--

172
00:12:23,542 --> 00:12:25,291
I'll take it.

173
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:28,125
How long do you
want it for?

174
00:12:28,208 --> 00:12:30,208
Five days most.
If I'm lucky, not even.

175
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,250
Charge by the week.

176
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:36,000
You can stay five, but
you gotta pay for seven.

177
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:37,667
In advance.

178
00:12:48,834 --> 00:12:50,917
Thank you, sir.
You'll not soon regret it.

179
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,583
That is a real fine car.

180
00:12:52,667 --> 00:12:53,917
Nobody builds them
like Ford,

181
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,750
doesn't matter
what year.

182
00:12:55,834 --> 00:12:58,917
Real fine.
Built Ford tough.

183
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,875
Happy driving.

184
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:02,333
Okay.

185
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:31,792
You got out-of-state papers?

186
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:33,542
Mm-hm.

187
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,208
Ned.

188
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:25,750
Where you heading?

189
00:14:26,709 --> 00:14:28,583
West.

190
00:14:28,667 --> 00:14:30,667
Just west.
Get in.

191
00:14:38,709 --> 00:14:40,834
Girl like you shouldn't
be hitching rides.

192
00:14:40,917 --> 00:14:42,417
You never know what...

193
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:46,834
Drive.

194
00:14:46,917 --> 00:14:49,208
...what kind of people
you're gonna meet.

195
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:55,041
Where to?
Just put your hands
on the wheel and move.

196
00:14:56,917 --> 00:14:58,417
You're the boss.

197
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:11,375
Yeah?

198
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:12,875
I'm looking
for Coke Bottles.

199
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:14,166
Who wants him?

200
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:15,625
Jude.

201
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:24,208
Well, lookit here.

202
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:27,250
What's a fine piece
of work like you

203
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:29,375
doin' in a place
like this?

204
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:31,417
That's cute.
Did you come up with
that shit yourself,

205
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,917
or did you steal it
from a greeting card?

206
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,083
That's my own
special brand of talk.

207
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:37,667
Like it?
Make you hot?

208
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:40,500
Yeah.
I'm having an orgasm
as we speak.

209
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:42,250
Where the hell you been?

210
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:44,041
I've been here every day
for the last five
looking for you.

211
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:46,208
I don't suppose
it's because I'm
the love of your life

212
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:48,417
and you want to
get with me?

213
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,834
I could lie if it would
make you feel better.

214
00:15:49,917 --> 00:15:52,500
And I bet you could
make me believe it, too.

215
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:55,041
Not that I'm not
enjoying this, but--

216
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:58,583
Ah, Johnny Coke Bottles.

217
00:15:58,667 --> 00:16:01,834
Nobody loves him
till they got
something hot to move.

218
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:16,333
Good quality.

219
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,917
Nice cuts.

220
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,667
You picked a good
assortment, too.

221
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:26,375
Oh, yes, ma'am.

222
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:30,041
These will
get you top dollar.

223
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:35,375
-And I won't touch them.
-What?

224
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:37,959
You need me to
Helen-Keller it for you?

225
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:40,291
I won't touch them.

226
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:42,583
You just said
they'd move at top-dollar.

227
00:16:42,667 --> 00:16:45,125
Three bodies back
at the jewelry store,

228
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:47,834
and every mother's son
is looking for these pieces.

229
00:16:47,917 --> 00:16:50,333
They got blood
all over them.

230
00:16:50,417 --> 00:16:52,166
Whoever gets caught
passing these

231
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:54,583
is gonna be looking
at hard time.

232
00:16:54,667 --> 00:16:57,834
Coke Bottles don't
have any hard time
left in him.

233
00:16:57,917 --> 00:16:59,667
Yeah, really?
Well, we had a deal.

234
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,250
You're gonna
fence these for me!

235
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:04,000
Murder wasn't part
of the deal, princess.

236
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:05,792
Coke Bottles
don't do murder.

237
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:08,709
Now, you come back when
those have cooled off.

238
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:10,667
Maybe six months.

239
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,291
Six months is too late.

240
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:13,750
Now is when
I need the money.

241
00:17:13,834 --> 00:17:15,625
Yeah.

242
00:17:15,709 --> 00:17:17,083
I'll bet you do.

243
00:17:18,583 --> 00:17:20,166
Yeah, I read the papers.

244
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:23,041
You left your friend
a short rope to hang by.

245
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,375
You don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

246
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:28,792
Only he gets out
from under the law.

247
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:32,709
And I guess you figure
the first thing
he's gonna do

248
00:17:32,792 --> 00:17:34,792
is come gunning for you,

249
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:38,250
and I'm guessing
you figure right.

250
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:41,709
Take your rocks
and go, sweet cheeks.

251
00:17:41,792 --> 00:17:43,917
Come see me
in six months.

252
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:46,750
If you're still alive.

253
00:17:47,792 --> 00:17:49,875
Mm.

254
00:17:49,959 --> 00:17:53,500
Now, unless
there's something else

255
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:55,583
Coke Bottles
can do for you...

256
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:01,709
Well...

257
00:18:01,792 --> 00:18:05,000
Yeah, there is something
that Coke Bottles
can do for me.

258
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:07,083
Coke Bottles can give me
the fucking money.

259
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:13,583
Oh, that's
my sister's boy, Everett.

260
00:18:13,667 --> 00:18:17,000
Dumb as a box of hair.
Only good for two things:

261
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:19,667
moving furniture
and killing people.

262
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,959
Put it down.

263
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:26,000
Great.

264
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,125
Now...

265
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,417
Let's you and me
talk about these jewels.

266
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:52,125
Where are you going?
Where are you going?

267
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:54,250
-I gotta take a leak.
-Keep driving!

268
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:56,709
-I have got to take a leak.
-Keep driving!

269
00:18:56,792 --> 00:18:59,250
We have been at this
for a couple
of hours now.

270
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:03,250
I am tired and hungry,
but I let that slide, okay?

271
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:05,125
If you don't go now,
I'm gonna kill you.

272
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:07,291
Right now, I gotta
take a leak.

273
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:10,375
So if you're
gonna shoot me,
go ahead and shoot me.

274
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:14,792
Because one way or another,
I'm gonna take a leak.

275
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:16,792
Don't get out of
the fucking car, man!

276
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:18,333
Come on.

277
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:21,917
Hold it!

278
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,959
Hold it! I'm serious!

279
00:19:24,709 --> 00:19:26,625
God damn it! Hold it!

280
00:19:30,417 --> 00:19:33,500
Have you ever killed
anybody before? Hmm?

281
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:36,208
That's a pop gun.
You're gonna have to get
a lot closer than that.

282
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:43,583
You're pointing
at my chest.

283
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:47,000
That's a .22.
It hits like a bee sting.

284
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:48,917
Point it at my head.

285
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:53,333
Good.

286
00:19:53,417 --> 00:19:55,333
Now, pull the trigger.

287
00:19:55,417 --> 00:19:57,166
Pull the fucking trigger!

288
00:20:00,542 --> 00:20:02,917
See? No guts.

289
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:08,291
Oh, shit.

290
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:10,834
Oh, shit. I didn't know
it was loaded, man.

291
00:20:10,917 --> 00:20:12,709
I swear to God.
I'm sorry.

292
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:19,709
Well, it was loaded,
wasn't it?

293
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:23,917
It was loaded!

294
00:20:40,917 --> 00:20:42,875
And you are
a stupid bitch.

295
00:20:42,959 --> 00:20:45,208
Wait, where you going?

296
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:47,709
You can't just leave me
here, man. I'm pregnant.

297
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:54,750
Yeah?

298
00:20:54,834 --> 00:20:56,709
Come here. What's this?

299
00:20:56,792 --> 00:20:58,417
Look at this.
What's this, Mommy?

300
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:01,166
You're not
fucking pregnant.

301
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:03,417
You're not pregnant.

302
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,834
Come on, man. You can't
just fucking leave me here.

303
00:21:05,917 --> 00:21:08,166
If you are coming,
let's go!

304
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,333
You got a name?

305
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:31,250
Bec.

306
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:32,917
Let me ask you
a question, Bec.

307
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:34,792
What would you do
a stupid thing

308
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:36,917
like going and pulling
a gun on me for?

309
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,875
I don't know.
I just--

310
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:46,792
Look, you're gonna
have to stop crying
and give me an answer.

311
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:49,583
If you wanna
stay in this car,
you gotta stop crying.

312
00:21:49,667 --> 00:21:52,583
I don't know. I just--
you know, hitchhiking
is dangerous,

313
00:21:52,667 --> 00:21:55,458
and, you know, I figured
I should pull a gun
before somebody else does.

314
00:21:55,542 --> 00:21:57,709
Pretty stupid move,
though, huh?

315
00:21:57,792 --> 00:22:00,458
And this pregnancy thing.
You think that was
gonna fool anybody?

316
00:22:00,542 --> 00:22:03,125
Nobody would hurt
a pregnant woman, right?

317
00:22:03,208 --> 00:22:06,250
No. I know men that
would rape you because
you were pregnant,

318
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:08,792
and if you were
blind and in church,
it'd be better.

319
00:22:08,875 --> 00:22:10,792
Oh, fuck, man, you're
not gonna hurt me, are you?

320
00:22:10,875 --> 00:22:14,917
I want to know what
you're hitching rides for.

321
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:16,417
I was running away.

322
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,750
From what?

323
00:22:20,041 --> 00:22:22,792
-What do you care?
-This is not about
what I care.

324
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:25,291
I'm asking you why you
were hitching rides for.

325
00:22:25,375 --> 00:22:28,000
No. What do you care, okay?

326
00:22:28,083 --> 00:22:29,500
Okay.

327
00:22:32,417 --> 00:22:34,083
-Get out.
-Hey, man, this is
the middle of nowhere.

328
00:22:34,166 --> 00:22:35,458
Get out!

329
00:22:35,542 --> 00:22:36,834
Come on, you
cannot leave me here.

330
00:22:36,917 --> 00:22:38,458
Please, all right?

331
00:22:38,542 --> 00:22:39,667
Please don't leave me here.

332
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:41,375
What were you
hitchhiking for?

333
00:22:47,583 --> 00:22:51,667
Because my father is a drunk,
and he beats me, okay?

334
00:22:52,542 --> 00:22:54,500
Every night
he gets drunk.

335
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:58,709
He comes home,
and he beats me...

336
00:23:00,125 --> 00:23:01,750
Or, you know...

337
00:23:05,041 --> 00:23:06,291
Does he touch you?

338
00:23:07,875 --> 00:23:11,333
No, he doesn't
touch me, man,
he fucks me.

339
00:23:11,417 --> 00:23:12,875
He fucks me.

340
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:18,291
-I'm sorry.
-What are you sorry for?

341
00:23:18,375 --> 00:23:19,959
-Are you sorry you asked?
-I'm sorry. No. I'm sorry.

342
00:23:20,041 --> 00:23:21,458
You know what
it's like to be used.

343
00:23:21,542 --> 00:23:22,959
You don't know
what it's like
to be violated!

344
00:23:23,041 --> 00:23:24,166
No, I'm just sorry.

345
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:25,709
I sympathize
with your position.

346
00:23:25,792 --> 00:23:28,458
"I sympathize," yeah.
What do you know?

347
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:36,583
There's a--
there's a woman...

348
00:23:37,792 --> 00:23:40,083
...out there that
I pulled a job with.

349
00:23:40,166 --> 00:23:43,542
And she... pushed me
from a speeding car

350
00:23:43,625 --> 00:23:45,208
in the middle
of a highway

351
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:48,667
to take the rap
for three murders
I didn't commit

352
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:52,417
while she escapes with
a quarter of a million
dollars in jewels.

353
00:23:58,959 --> 00:24:01,834
All right.
So you do know what
it's like to get fucked.

354
00:24:22,667 --> 00:24:24,250
Let's go.

355
00:24:24,333 --> 00:24:26,041
Wait. I've never
been anywhere, man.

356
00:24:26,125 --> 00:24:27,750
I wanna get pictures
of everything.

357
00:24:27,834 --> 00:24:31,542
Then take a picture
of me blowing out
of here.

358
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,709
You think I'm kidding?

359
00:24:59,291 --> 00:25:01,875
There's a Coke in there
for you, too,

360
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,583
a sandwich,
whatever you want.

361
00:25:07,333 --> 00:25:09,333
Where were you headed?
I mean, you were running away.

362
00:25:09,417 --> 00:25:11,083
Where were you headed?

363
00:25:11,166 --> 00:25:14,125
I don't know.
Anyplace, man.

364
00:25:14,208 --> 00:25:16,500
Anyplace
is better than where
I've been, right?

365
00:25:16,583 --> 00:25:18,250
Yep.

366
00:25:18,333 --> 00:25:20,166
If you were running away,
where would you go?

367
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:23,500
I don't know.
I'd go to Canada.

368
00:25:23,583 --> 00:25:25,792
-Canada?
-I'd go to Canada.

369
00:25:25,875 --> 00:25:27,333
Why?

370
00:25:27,417 --> 00:25:29,166
Because I've been up there,
and it's beautiful:

371
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:32,417
wide open spaces,
not a lot of people
crowding you.

372
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:35,000
You get free healthcare
from the government,
which is good.

373
00:25:35,083 --> 00:25:37,125
You've just got to be
a citizen to get it.

374
00:25:37,208 --> 00:25:39,792
Oh, yeah? And how
would you do that?

375
00:25:39,875 --> 00:25:42,083
The best way
is to marry a Canadian.

376
00:25:42,166 --> 00:25:43,834
You would?

377
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:46,041
-Yes, ma'am.
-I, uh...

378
00:25:46,125 --> 00:25:48,458
I guess that wouldn't
happen to me.

379
00:25:48,542 --> 00:25:51,083
-Why not?
-Why would it?

380
00:25:51,792 --> 00:25:53,041
You're a pretty girl.

381
00:25:53,125 --> 00:25:55,458
Oh, yeah. Right.

382
00:25:55,542 --> 00:25:57,417
-Sure.
-Yeah.

383
00:26:03,458 --> 00:26:05,959
So what happened when you
robbed that jewelry store?

384
00:26:08,125 --> 00:26:10,625
-I was just curious.
-Yeah.

385
00:26:13,083 --> 00:26:14,500
What happened.

386
00:26:14,583 --> 00:26:16,208
I don't know.
I don't know
what happened.

387
00:26:16,291 --> 00:26:18,208
I don't know, you know?

388
00:26:18,291 --> 00:26:22,125
It was going as planned,
no problem.

389
00:26:22,208 --> 00:26:24,000
I was heading
out the door,
and then Jude--

390
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:25,667
That's the girl,
your partner?

391
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:26,917
-Yeah.
-Jude?

392
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,500
Yeah. That's Jude. Jude.

393
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:33,208
Jude starts blasting.

394
00:26:33,291 --> 00:26:35,959
Three people in the store,
kills them all.

395
00:26:37,166 --> 00:26:38,667
She didn't
have to do that.

396
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,250
She didn't have
to do that.

397
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:43,000
That brought the cops.

398
00:26:44,917 --> 00:26:46,709
We take off,
they give chase.

399
00:26:46,792 --> 00:26:49,083
Next thing I know,
I'm chewing
on some asphalt

400
00:26:49,166 --> 00:26:52,166
while old Jude is
tearing up the highway,
a free woman.

401
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:54,208
She just shot three people
for no reason?

402
00:26:54,291 --> 00:26:57,125
I guess Jude
doesn't need a reason.

403
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:02,375
So you're gonna
go and find her?

404
00:27:02,458 --> 00:27:04,917
Yeah.
I'm gonna find her.

405
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,291
I don't care
how long it takes.

406
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:09,417
I'm gonna hunt her down
and kill her.

407
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,709
You must really
like her, man.

408
00:27:13,041 --> 00:27:15,500
You must really
like her.

409
00:27:15,959 --> 00:27:18,375
What?

410
00:27:18,458 --> 00:27:21,250
Well, I mean, that
is not something you do

411
00:27:21,333 --> 00:27:23,125
because you hate
a woman, you know,

412
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:24,375
just because
she did you wrong.

413
00:27:24,458 --> 00:27:27,125
You don't hunt
the world for her.

414
00:27:27,208 --> 00:27:28,959
I know I never had
anybody like me so much

415
00:27:29,041 --> 00:27:30,875
that they wanted
to hunt me down.

416
00:27:33,542 --> 00:27:35,166
That's heavy.

417
00:27:36,875 --> 00:27:38,542
Well...

418
00:27:38,625 --> 00:27:39,792
Weird, man.

419
00:27:39,875 --> 00:27:41,959
You are weird.

420
00:27:42,041 --> 00:27:44,959
-No, I'm not.
-You're weird.

421
00:27:45,041 --> 00:27:47,583
You just like her.
You like her a lot.

422
00:27:47,667 --> 00:27:48,625
Have a sandwich,
would ya?

423
00:28:05,917 --> 00:28:08,000
Hey, Tom, how you doing?

424
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,917
Pick you up another .22?

425
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,333
I was
thinking about it.

426
00:28:14,417 --> 00:28:16,166
What's the deal
with these?

427
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:17,458
They call them
cop killers,

428
00:28:17,542 --> 00:28:19,792
but they're good
on squirrels, too.

429
00:28:19,875 --> 00:28:21,333
Thanks so much,
Travis.

430
00:28:21,417 --> 00:28:24,083
Y'all take
care now. Bye-bye.

431
00:28:26,375 --> 00:28:29,417
Well, how are you
this evening, miss?

432
00:28:32,208 --> 00:28:34,542
Good. Can I help you
with anything?

433
00:28:37,041 --> 00:28:38,709
I want to buy a gun.

434
00:28:38,792 --> 00:28:40,333
Uh, hunting rifle?
Shotgun?

435
00:28:40,417 --> 00:28:42,959
-Handgun?
-Would this be for yourself?

436
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:47,500
I, uh... lost mine.

437
00:28:47,583 --> 00:28:49,000
I don't feel safe
without one.

438
00:28:49,083 --> 00:28:51,041
Handguns do make
the best protection.

439
00:28:51,125 --> 00:28:54,375
Now, this here-- now, this
is a very nice model.

440
00:28:54,458 --> 00:28:56,709
It's light.
It's got a hair-trigger,

441
00:28:56,792 --> 00:28:58,375
which makes it easy
for a lady to use.

442
00:28:58,458 --> 00:29:00,875
And it fits comfortably
into a purse or handbag.

443
00:29:00,959 --> 00:29:02,458
Isn't that cute?

444
00:29:02,542 --> 00:29:04,709
Let me see
this Smith & Wesson.

445
00:29:04,792 --> 00:29:08,166
Oh...
Well, that's a big gun.

446
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:09,875
I don't think
you want a big gun.

447
00:29:09,959 --> 00:29:11,542
This here's a small gun.

448
00:29:11,625 --> 00:29:13,125
What are you,
Captain Kangaroo?

449
00:29:15,333 --> 00:29:17,333
Smith & Wesson, please?

450
00:29:25,583 --> 00:29:28,208
Smith & Wesson,
15-round mag

451
00:29:28,291 --> 00:29:29,667
with one in the chamber.

452
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:32,458
Semi-auto,
double-action.

453
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:37,917
I know. Nice.

454
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,333
I'll take it
and the Beretta.

455
00:29:41,417 --> 00:29:44,000
Well, now, you know there's
a 20-day waiting period?

456
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,500
Twenty days?

457
00:29:47,583 --> 00:29:49,166
It's the goddamn liberals,
that what it is.

458
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:50,500
It's the goddamn liberals.

459
00:29:50,583 --> 00:29:52,542
I can't wait 20 days.

460
00:29:52,625 --> 00:29:56,208
Well... there really
isn't anything
I can do about it.

461
00:29:58,375 --> 00:30:00,959
But I-- I just don't
feel safe without a gun.

462
00:30:01,041 --> 00:30:05,041
I understand.
Believe me, I do,
but...

463
00:30:12,208 --> 00:30:13,709
Uh...

464
00:30:17,458 --> 00:30:20,792
Well, of course,
rules were meant
to be broken, huh?

465
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,792
I think I'm gonna
like it around here.

466
00:30:36,709 --> 00:30:41,750
♪ I can't see me
lovin' nobody but you ♪

467
00:30:41,834 --> 00:30:45,333
♪ For all my life ♪

468
00:30:46,667 --> 00:30:48,333
Wake up.
We're here.

469
00:30:49,917 --> 00:30:51,417
Wake up.

470
00:30:52,166 --> 00:30:53,750
Uncle Mike!

471
00:30:56,083 --> 00:30:59,000
Son of a bitch! Ned!

472
00:30:59,083 --> 00:31:02,500
I didn't think
I'd be seeing you
anytime soon.

473
00:31:02,583 --> 00:31:05,000
I heard what happened.

474
00:31:05,083 --> 00:31:07,750
Hell of a thing,
getting caught like that.

475
00:31:07,834 --> 00:31:09,542
Hey, man,
nice to see you.

476
00:31:10,917 --> 00:31:13,750
-Been too long.
-Jesus, it's good to see you.

477
00:31:13,834 --> 00:31:16,000
-It's good to see you!
-You, too, man. You, too.

478
00:31:16,083 --> 00:31:17,709
And who's this
pretty thing?

479
00:31:17,792 --> 00:31:20,333
I'm Bec.
It's nice to meet you, sir.

480
00:31:20,417 --> 00:31:23,208
Hi. Call me Uncle.
We're all family here.

481
00:31:23,291 --> 00:31:25,166
Real nice. That's yours?

482
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:27,542
No, she's not anybody's.
She's just along for the ride.

483
00:31:27,625 --> 00:31:30,166
Ah, well, sure glad you
made it through okay.

484
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:31,875
I thought we lost you
this time.

485
00:31:31,959 --> 00:31:33,375
Me, too.

486
00:31:33,458 --> 00:31:35,375
Well, come on in
out of the dark.

487
00:31:35,458 --> 00:31:38,458
Come on, see if I can't
fix you some, uh...

488
00:31:38,542 --> 00:31:41,792
I think I got some chili
might still be good.

489
00:32:02,458 --> 00:32:04,834
Be careful now.

490
00:32:09,333 --> 00:32:11,250
There. Spoon that in you

491
00:32:11,333 --> 00:32:13,291
and see how
it makes you feel.

492
00:32:24,792 --> 00:32:28,500
Heavenly father,
bless this bountiful feast
we are about to receive

493
00:32:28,583 --> 00:32:30,834
for which we are
forever thankful.

494
00:32:30,917 --> 00:32:34,417
Bless those, too,
who are not here today
to share our tidings.

495
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,208
Keep them until we
may be with them.

496
00:32:36,291 --> 00:32:39,041
We ask this in the name
of Jesus Christ. Amen.

497
00:32:39,125 --> 00:32:40,542
Amen.

498
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:42,208
Amen.

499
00:32:44,208 --> 00:32:45,458
Oh, hey, Ned.

500
00:32:45,542 --> 00:32:47,041
I got something for you.

501
00:32:55,792 --> 00:32:58,542
Might need that
down the road.

502
00:32:59,625 --> 00:33:00,875
Thanks, Mike.

503
00:33:00,959 --> 00:33:02,250
Hey, Mike.

504
00:33:02,333 --> 00:33:03,834
Are you really
Ned's uncle?

505
00:33:08,959 --> 00:33:11,083
Oh, no.

506
00:33:11,166 --> 00:33:13,875
No, I just--
I know him and Jude
from way back.

507
00:33:13,959 --> 00:33:16,291
I met them
in a doughnut shop
in Albuquerque.

508
00:33:16,375 --> 00:33:18,208
Santa Fe.

509
00:33:18,291 --> 00:33:19,625
Santa Fe.

510
00:33:19,709 --> 00:33:21,875
We're having some
crullers and coffee

511
00:33:21,959 --> 00:33:25,333
when them two walk in
and decide to rob
the place.

512
00:33:25,417 --> 00:33:27,166
- Jude's idea.
- Well, whoever.

513
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:29,458
They pulled their guns,
and they started acting

514
00:33:29,542 --> 00:33:32,333
-like a low rent
Bonnie and Clyde.
-Shit. What happened?

515
00:33:32,417 --> 00:33:35,500
What do you think happened?
They tried to rob
a doughnut shop.

516
00:33:35,583 --> 00:33:38,125
They had more cops
on them than a black man
in Birmingham.

517
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:41,250
Mike got us out.

518
00:33:41,333 --> 00:33:42,667
Oh, yeah?
What'd you do?

519
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:44,834
I felt bad for the kids.

520
00:33:44,917 --> 00:33:47,750
I know what it's
like to be in over
your head like that,

521
00:33:47,834 --> 00:33:51,625
so I pulled my piece
and started blasting.

522
00:33:51,709 --> 00:33:52,959
Shot our way out.

523
00:33:53,041 --> 00:33:55,166
Was anybody hurt?

524
00:33:56,041 --> 00:33:57,417
Cop got killed.

525
00:33:58,667 --> 00:34:00,000
You killed a cop?

526
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:03,000
I didn't say that.

527
00:34:03,083 --> 00:34:05,000
Cop got shot.
There was a lot
of lead flying.

528
00:34:05,083 --> 00:34:06,291
I think another cop
shot him.

529
00:34:06,375 --> 00:34:08,208
Well, you know,
I always said,

530
00:34:08,291 --> 00:34:10,208
ain't the wild west
out there.

531
00:34:10,291 --> 00:34:13,000
Got to know the score
going in.

532
00:34:13,083 --> 00:34:14,834
That's where Jude
fucked you up.

533
00:34:14,917 --> 00:34:16,458
She shoots first,

534
00:34:16,542 --> 00:34:18,959
and she doesn't even bother
asking questions.

535
00:34:19,041 --> 00:34:21,166
And you,
you just go along,

536
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:24,041
dragging your tongue
in the dirt
right behind her.

537
00:34:24,125 --> 00:34:27,125
Oh, boy. A lot
of wise talk

538
00:34:27,208 --> 00:34:30,375
for an old man
sitting on his ass
out here alone, Mike.

539
00:34:32,625 --> 00:34:34,542
You weren't there.
You don't know how
we had it worked.

540
00:34:34,625 --> 00:34:37,041
Well, I know exactly
how you worked it.

541
00:34:37,125 --> 00:34:38,792
Jude told me
all about it.

542
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:41,041
She was here,
you know.

543
00:34:41,125 --> 00:34:42,959
Stopped
on her way west.

544
00:34:44,458 --> 00:34:46,208
Bad call, Ned.

545
00:34:46,291 --> 00:34:50,083
Three people dead,
and you left to take
the fall.

546
00:34:50,166 --> 00:34:53,709
Once you thought
with your head
instead of your cock.

547
00:34:53,792 --> 00:34:55,375
You wouldn't let that girl
sucker you in.

548
00:34:55,458 --> 00:34:57,917
It's the same
as you let Brice
sucker you along.

549
00:34:59,625 --> 00:35:02,041
Face it, Ned. Some men are born
smart about women

550
00:35:02,125 --> 00:35:04,333
and some
are born stupid and....

551
00:35:05,834 --> 00:35:07,500
...you were born stupid.

552
00:35:14,417 --> 00:35:16,041
Love you
like a brother, Mike,

553
00:35:16,125 --> 00:35:18,333
but do yourself
a favor.

554
00:35:18,417 --> 00:35:21,166
Never call me stupid again.

555
00:35:45,041 --> 00:35:46,375
Yeah.

556
00:35:52,041 --> 00:35:53,709
Ned, did you really
kill a cop?

557
00:35:56,792 --> 00:35:59,959
I told you what happened.
I didn't kill anybody.

558
00:36:00,041 --> 00:36:01,959
Somebody did.

559
00:36:02,041 --> 00:36:03,542
Doesn't that bother you?

560
00:36:12,375 --> 00:36:15,917
Uh... we are not kids
playing games here.

561
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,333
This is real, and if you're
going to hang with us,

562
00:36:18,417 --> 00:36:20,333
you better get
with that real quick.

563
00:36:20,834 --> 00:36:22,250
Okay?

564
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:29,667
Ned, it's for you.

565
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:54,041
Hello.

566
00:36:55,291 --> 00:36:56,583
Hey, Ned.

567
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:08,041
Hey.

568
00:37:08,125 --> 00:37:10,375
I figured you'd stop
at Uncle Mike's.

569
00:37:10,458 --> 00:37:11,709
How are you?

570
00:37:11,792 --> 00:37:14,125
My head's a little sore,
but I'm okay.

571
00:37:14,208 --> 00:37:15,542
How about you?

572
00:37:15,625 --> 00:37:16,875
I'm good.

573
00:37:19,125 --> 00:37:21,542
That dead cop
got to you?

574
00:37:21,625 --> 00:37:24,125
It's just Ned doesn't
seem like the type
of person

575
00:37:24,208 --> 00:37:25,875
that would
kill somebody.

576
00:37:25,959 --> 00:37:28,041
-Jude.
-Yeah?

577
00:37:28,125 --> 00:37:29,792
I'm gonna kill you for this.

578
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:32,500
Everybody's
the killing kind.

579
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:34,083
If it's their back
against the wall,

580
00:37:34,166 --> 00:37:35,917
they'd pull the trigger, too.

581
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,917
The only difference
between Ned and most people

582
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,792
is he's already
had to do it.

583
00:37:45,583 --> 00:37:48,542
So what's it like,
pulling a job?

584
00:37:48,625 --> 00:37:50,792
Is it fun, exciting?

585
00:37:53,917 --> 00:37:59,500
Only the amateurs
do it for the jazz.
See, a good job--

586
00:37:59,583 --> 00:38:02,500
Oh, you gotta have it figured,
every step of the way.

587
00:38:02,583 --> 00:38:04,917
You come up with 50 ways
you could get caught,

588
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,834
you're still short
by 200.

589
00:38:07,917 --> 00:38:11,375
It's a skill,
but that is the beauty of it.

590
00:38:11,458 --> 00:38:12,875
It's not the thrill
of pulling a robbery,

591
00:38:12,959 --> 00:38:15,458
it's the satisfaction
of a job well-done.

592
00:38:15,542 --> 00:38:16,792
Ned, it isn't like you think.

593
00:38:16,875 --> 00:38:18,583
You didn't leave me
for the cops?

594
00:38:18,667 --> 00:38:20,750
What was I supposed to do?
Who would it have helped

595
00:38:20,834 --> 00:38:22,625
if I'd gone down, too?

596
00:38:22,709 --> 00:38:26,291
But you-- you got it
for him, don't you?

597
00:38:27,166 --> 00:38:28,625
Ned?
Yeah.

598
00:38:28,709 --> 00:38:31,625
Have I got it
for him?

599
00:38:31,709 --> 00:38:33,417
Maybe.

600
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:35,542
Maybe.

601
00:38:35,625 --> 00:38:38,041
Your boyfriend
would be awfully jealous
if he could hear you.

602
00:38:38,125 --> 00:38:40,125
Yeah, my boyfriend.
I don't have
a boyfriend.

603
00:38:40,208 --> 00:38:41,709
A pretty girl like you
with no boy?

604
00:38:41,792 --> 00:38:45,458
No.
That don't seem right.

605
00:38:45,542 --> 00:38:48,542
We could've been together.
You don't want to be together?

606
00:38:50,208 --> 00:38:52,417
Would you have stayed
for me?

607
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:56,000
Three dead bodies
and a sackful of jewels
by your side?

608
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:58,166
Would you have stayed?

609
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:02,542
What's that, Ned?
I didn't hear you.

610
00:39:04,834 --> 00:39:08,417
Where are you? Hmm?

611
00:39:09,542 --> 00:39:11,333
Jude, make it easy
on yourself

612
00:39:11,417 --> 00:39:12,792
and tell me
where you are.

613
00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:23,166
Jude, I want you to listen
to me very carefully now.

614
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:25,625
I am going to find you
and kill you.

615
00:39:25,709 --> 00:39:27,667
-Did you hear me?
-Ned.

616
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:31,417
I am going to find you
and kill you.

617
00:39:52,917 --> 00:39:55,959
Yeah, operator,
I need to make
a long distance call.

618
00:39:56,041 --> 00:39:57,875
So what is she like?

619
00:39:57,959 --> 00:39:59,667
Jude?
Mm-hm.

620
00:40:01,250 --> 00:40:03,625
Now, she got--
she got her good points.

621
00:40:03,709 --> 00:40:06,834
She's smart,
good-looking,

622
00:40:06,917 --> 00:40:09,709
but dangerous,
like a stray bullet.

623
00:40:09,792 --> 00:40:11,834
Women are no good
to have around--

624
00:40:11,917 --> 00:40:13,291
Oh, I shouldn't have
said that in front of you,

625
00:40:13,375 --> 00:40:14,709
but that is
the way it is.

626
00:40:14,792 --> 00:40:16,542
Women are
nothing but trouble.

627
00:40:16,625 --> 00:40:19,417
And Jude is as bad
as they come.

628
00:40:21,333 --> 00:40:23,041
I wouldn't
turn my back on her

629
00:40:23,125 --> 00:40:24,583
if she was two-days dead.

630
00:40:24,667 --> 00:40:26,417
She couldn't be
that bad.

631
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:29,333
Ned wouldn't like her
if she was.

632
00:40:29,417 --> 00:40:31,000
Maybe she wasn't
always that way.

633
00:40:31,083 --> 00:40:33,834
Maybe she's just
a good girl gone bad.

634
00:40:33,917 --> 00:40:35,250
She was born bad.

635
00:40:35,333 --> 00:40:37,709
Nobody had to teach her
anything about it.

636
00:40:37,792 --> 00:40:40,333
That would be like
giving a kangaroo
hopping lessons.

637
00:40:41,166 --> 00:40:43,333
No, Jude did not go bad.

638
00:40:44,166 --> 00:40:46,250
She just got worse.

639
00:40:46,333 --> 00:40:49,041
What, that much
for chicken?

640
00:40:49,125 --> 00:40:51,041
I can't believe it.
Chicken.

641
00:40:51,125 --> 00:40:52,917
That's what
it says.

642
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,583
You see what it says,
don't you?

643
00:40:54,667 --> 00:40:58,125
Yeah, right.
Forget about that.
Uh, I want...

644
00:41:00,333 --> 00:41:02,458
How much is
a cheeseburger?

645
00:41:02,542 --> 00:41:05,125
Three seventy-five.

646
00:41:05,208 --> 00:41:07,125
How much is
a regular burger?

647
00:41:07,208 --> 00:41:08,625
Three.

648
00:41:11,875 --> 00:41:13,375
All right. Give me
a regular burger.

649
00:41:13,458 --> 00:41:15,083
You want
fries with that?

650
00:41:15,166 --> 00:41:16,458
How much are fries?

651
00:41:16,542 --> 00:41:18,291
A buck extra.

652
00:41:21,041 --> 00:41:22,709
How much
is a regular burger?

653
00:41:22,792 --> 00:41:25,542
Three. Three dollars.
Same as when I told you before.

654
00:41:27,542 --> 00:41:30,417
-Just the burger.
-Isn't that sad, Inez?

655
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:32,083
What's that?

656
00:41:32,166 --> 00:41:34,583
A man who
can't even buy fries
to go with his burger.

657
00:41:34,667 --> 00:41:36,959
Yeah, look at me.
My heart's busted.

658
00:41:37,041 --> 00:41:38,709
Man works hard
for what he's got.

659
00:41:38,792 --> 00:41:40,875
A handful of fries
is all he asks in return.

660
00:41:40,959 --> 00:41:42,917
Well, he can ask.
We ain't giving them away.

661
00:41:43,041 --> 00:41:45,750
Politicians promise
to keep the Mexicans out,
cut taxes.

662
00:41:45,834 --> 00:41:47,792
Why don't they promise
a man what he needs?

663
00:41:47,875 --> 00:41:50,166
Fries on his plate
and a woman in his bed.

664
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:52,166
Hey, fuck you, okay?

665
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:54,583
Ooh, take a pill.

666
00:41:54,667 --> 00:41:57,250
We were just
having some fun,
weren't we, Inez?

667
00:41:57,333 --> 00:42:00,959
Fun or no fun,
we're not giving
the fries away.

668
00:42:01,041 --> 00:42:03,291
Why don't you let me
buy you a plate?

669
00:42:03,375 --> 00:42:05,166
Keep your money,
lady.

670
00:42:05,250 --> 00:42:09,125
You're an awful hard guy
for someone who can't
even buy fries.

671
00:42:09,208 --> 00:42:11,834
Bring him a plate
and throw some cheese
on his burger.

672
00:42:11,917 --> 00:42:13,458
Big spender.

673
00:42:13,542 --> 00:42:15,166
Order up!
Burger and fries.

674
00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:16,792
Thanks.
I appreciate that.

675
00:42:16,875 --> 00:42:18,625
Cheese on it.

676
00:42:18,709 --> 00:42:20,792
Guess it took
a little more money
than I figured

677
00:42:20,875 --> 00:42:22,291
to get out here.

678
00:42:22,375 --> 00:42:24,417
I ran a little dry,
you know?

679
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:26,709
Can't help
from getting hungry.

680
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:29,542
Can't help getting
a little lonely, either.

681
00:42:29,625 --> 00:42:31,208
-You mind if I sit down?
-My boyfriend might.

682
00:42:31,291 --> 00:42:34,458
You got that
in quick, didn't you?

683
00:42:34,542 --> 00:42:37,375
Relax. He's a ways away.

684
00:42:37,458 --> 00:42:38,917
What's your name?

685
00:42:40,291 --> 00:42:42,000
-T.
-Tea?

686
00:42:42,083 --> 00:42:44,375
-As in and crumpets?
-Huh?

687
00:42:44,458 --> 00:42:46,583
So what happened
to the rest of your name, T?

688
00:42:47,583 --> 00:42:50,625
Oh, that's all
my parents give me.

689
00:42:50,709 --> 00:42:52,542
What about you,
you got a name?

690
00:42:52,625 --> 00:42:54,667
I'm sure my boyfriend's
got a few for me.

691
00:42:54,750 --> 00:42:56,875
Most of the time
he calls me Jude.

692
00:42:56,959 --> 00:42:59,792
Oh. Well, where
is he anyway?

693
00:42:59,875 --> 00:43:01,041
Down around Tempe.

694
00:43:01,125 --> 00:43:03,208
Tempe?
What's he doing there?

695
00:43:03,291 --> 00:43:06,083
Looking for me.

696
00:43:06,166 --> 00:43:07,583
Well,
what did you do?

697
00:43:07,667 --> 00:43:09,250
I pissed him off.

698
00:43:10,250 --> 00:43:12,959
I have a habit
of pissing men off.

699
00:43:31,792 --> 00:43:35,083
So, how do you fill
your days, T?

700
00:43:35,166 --> 00:43:37,000
Or is it Mr. T?

701
00:43:38,792 --> 00:43:42,000
Ah, well, I used
to work in a brewery
in Milwaukee.

702
00:43:42,083 --> 00:43:44,250
-Till I got laid off.
-Mm-hm.

703
00:43:44,333 --> 00:43:46,500
Uh, came down here
looking for work.

704
00:43:46,583 --> 00:43:50,166
Read in a magazine
this place is booming.

705
00:43:51,041 --> 00:43:52,375
Booming?
Yeah.

706
00:43:52,458 --> 00:43:54,959
It's depressed as hell
around here.

707
00:43:55,041 --> 00:43:56,542
Oh.

708
00:43:57,458 --> 00:43:58,959
It was an old magazine.

709
00:44:00,041 --> 00:44:02,458
Kind of slow,
aren't you, T?

710
00:44:02,542 --> 00:44:05,542
I guess so.
I'll give you this.

711
00:44:05,625 --> 00:44:07,291
You got a way
of making dumb look good.

712
00:44:07,375 --> 00:44:09,208
Huh?

713
00:44:10,125 --> 00:44:11,792
Oh, ooh!

714
00:44:22,208 --> 00:44:23,250
Shh!

715
00:44:23,333 --> 00:44:24,875
I'm back.

716
00:44:25,959 --> 00:44:27,625
I'm not gonna hurt you.

717
00:44:27,709 --> 00:44:30,500
I just wanna get
close to you,
that's all.

718
00:44:30,583 --> 00:44:32,083
Hey, what are you
doing that for?

719
00:44:32,166 --> 00:44:34,000
I said I wasn't
gonna hurt ya.

720
00:44:34,083 --> 00:44:36,542
Just settle down,
and you'll like it.

721
00:44:38,667 --> 00:44:40,750
Mike! Come on!

722
00:44:42,917 --> 00:44:44,500
Get away from her, Mike.

723
00:44:44,583 --> 00:44:47,000
You shouldn't have
done that, Ned.

724
00:44:47,083 --> 00:44:48,750
You really shouldn't
have done that.

725
00:45:22,250 --> 00:45:23,542
No.

726
00:45:24,208 --> 00:45:25,959
-No.
-Mike.

727
00:46:13,750 --> 00:46:15,125
Uhh!

728
00:46:27,125 --> 00:46:28,917
Shot with my own gun.

729
00:46:30,583 --> 00:46:32,667
Th-that's what hurts.

730
00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:34,417
I had to, Mike.
You left me no choice.

731
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:37,667
My own friend shoots me
with my own gun.

732
00:46:43,709 --> 00:46:46,250
I knew having a girl around
wasn't gonna be any good.

733
00:46:46,333 --> 00:46:48,875
She's got nothing
to do with this,
and you know it.

734
00:46:54,333 --> 00:46:55,792
I guess not.

735
00:46:58,375 --> 00:46:59,709
I'm sorry.

736
00:46:59,792 --> 00:47:01,959
I, uh...

737
00:47:02,041 --> 00:47:04,542
Uh, I didn't
mean nothing by it.

738
00:47:04,625 --> 00:47:07,291
I just...

739
00:47:07,375 --> 00:47:10,125
I went crazy for a minute,
you know?

740
00:47:10,208 --> 00:47:13,083
I think living by yourself...

741
00:47:13,166 --> 00:47:14,667
for so long...

742
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:18,417
...it makes ya
forget your manners.

743
00:47:21,375 --> 00:47:23,500
I just went a little crazy.

744
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:27,750
But...

745
00:47:28,875 --> 00:47:30,291
...I'm okay now.

746
00:47:30,375 --> 00:47:32,208
Okay now.

747
00:47:36,083 --> 00:47:37,333
Uhh!

748
00:47:45,417 --> 00:47:48,500
Being gut-shot's
a bad way to die. Slow.

749
00:47:48,583 --> 00:47:52,500
Oh, it hurts
like a son of a bitch.

750
00:47:52,583 --> 00:47:55,500
And I don't wanna die
gut-shot, Ned.

751
00:47:55,583 --> 00:47:57,333
Go call an ambulance.

752
00:47:57,417 --> 00:48:01,000
No, no! It's not
like the city, Ned.

753
00:48:01,083 --> 00:48:03,542
It's... hospital is...

754
00:48:07,125 --> 00:48:09,375
It's more than
an hour away.

755
00:48:09,458 --> 00:48:13,458
Meanwhile, I'll just
be sitting here...

756
00:48:14,208 --> 00:48:16,291
...dying.

757
00:48:21,917 --> 00:48:23,291
Ned...

758
00:48:26,875 --> 00:48:28,291
Y-you gotta do it.

759
00:48:28,375 --> 00:48:30,458
Don't let me
die like this.

760
00:48:34,125 --> 00:48:36,458
-Ned...
-Get your things.

761
00:48:37,125 --> 00:48:38,667
Go get your things.

762
00:48:48,417 --> 00:48:49,834
Start the car.

763
00:48:49,917 --> 00:48:51,667
-Ned, please--
-Go outside.

764
00:48:51,750 --> 00:48:53,625
Start the car! Go!

765
00:49:23,208 --> 00:49:24,583
Mike...

766
00:49:29,709 --> 00:49:31,542
No! Shit!

767
00:49:35,125 --> 00:49:36,792
I'm not even
gonna ask you

768
00:49:36,875 --> 00:49:38,291
because I know
you didn't shoot him.

769
00:49:38,375 --> 00:49:39,542
I know you called
an ambulance.

770
00:49:39,625 --> 00:49:41,125
I don't wanna
hear about it, okay?

771
00:49:41,208 --> 00:49:43,959
He was right about you.
He was right about you.

772
00:49:44,041 --> 00:49:45,375
If I hadn't have
brought you in there,

773
00:49:45,458 --> 00:49:46,959
this never
would've happened.

774
00:49:47,041 --> 00:49:48,375
What am I supposed
to say to that?

775
00:49:48,458 --> 00:49:50,250
You are not supposed
to say anything.

776
00:49:50,333 --> 00:49:52,125
You're supposed
to shut your mouth.

777
00:49:52,208 --> 00:49:53,458
I can't believe
you shot him for me.

778
00:49:53,542 --> 00:49:54,959
I didn't shoot him
for you.

779
00:49:55,041 --> 00:49:56,041
You have nothing
to do with this.

780
00:49:56,125 --> 00:49:57,917
He left me no choice.

781
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,375
You are not
a part of this,

782
00:49:59,458 --> 00:50:01,542
so you don't need
to talk about it.

783
00:50:01,625 --> 00:50:03,125
I couldn't have
shot him for you.

784
00:50:03,208 --> 00:50:04,959
-If you had to, you
would've, sweetheart.
-No!

785
00:50:05,041 --> 00:50:06,333
-If you had to,
you would've, sweetheart.
-No! No!

786
00:50:06,417 --> 00:50:07,667
Is that what
you're gonna do to Jude?

787
00:50:07,750 --> 00:50:09,333
Just gonna hunt her down
and shoot her?

788
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,375
If I have to.

789
00:50:12,709 --> 00:50:14,166
If I had to...

790
00:50:14,917 --> 00:50:16,375
...I'd shoot you.

791
00:51:05,125 --> 00:51:07,667
What? What's so funny?

792
00:51:07,750 --> 00:51:09,875
My Favorite Martian.

793
00:51:09,959 --> 00:51:12,291
You ever watch
that show?

794
00:51:13,959 --> 00:51:16,166
That's what
you're laughing at?

795
00:51:16,250 --> 00:51:19,709
Jesus Christ.
What?

796
00:51:19,792 --> 00:51:22,041
I'm in bed with you,
and you're thinking
about a goddamn TV show?

797
00:51:22,125 --> 00:51:24,625
You men and your
weak, little egos.

798
00:51:33,667 --> 00:51:36,625
You know all about men,
don't you?

799
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:45,709
You know all about me.

800
00:51:45,792 --> 00:51:48,834
Not that there's much
to know about,
I admit that.

801
00:51:50,291 --> 00:51:52,583
You ain't
such a hard read
yourself, you know,

802
00:51:52,667 --> 00:51:54,333
about the kind of woman
you are.

803
00:51:55,750 --> 00:51:56,917
Oh, really?

804
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,750
What kind of woman
is that?

805
00:51:58,834 --> 00:52:01,083
The kind of woman
that's good-looking
and knows it.

806
00:52:03,291 --> 00:52:05,750
You always had men
falling all over you,
haven't you, huh?

807
00:52:05,834 --> 00:52:08,417
Always gotten your way, huh?

808
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:10,792
Should I be
taking notes?

809
00:52:13,333 --> 00:52:14,792
No.

810
00:52:14,875 --> 00:52:16,333
That's it.

811
00:52:18,458 --> 00:52:20,625
'Cept you're smart.

812
00:52:24,166 --> 00:52:27,959
Smart enough to know
someday those looks
are gonna wear away,

813
00:52:28,041 --> 00:52:30,375
and you're gonna be
all on your own, baby.

814
00:52:30,458 --> 00:52:32,333
Huh? I bet that scares you.

815
00:52:33,542 --> 00:52:35,875
Knock it off.

816
00:52:35,959 --> 00:52:38,792
Scares you to think
you're gonna grow old
and normal-looking

817
00:52:38,875 --> 00:52:40,291
just like the rest of us.

818
00:52:40,375 --> 00:52:42,458
And it scares you to think
you're not gonna be able

819
00:52:42,542 --> 00:52:44,250
to get away
with making fun
of guys in diners

820
00:52:44,333 --> 00:52:46,959
just 'cause
they wanna fuck ya.

821
00:52:47,041 --> 00:52:48,709
I never even
thought about it.

822
00:52:48,792 --> 00:52:50,583
Sure, you have.

823
00:52:51,709 --> 00:52:53,333
Hardly ever.

824
00:52:53,417 --> 00:52:56,250
Not even for two or three
minutes at a stretch.

825
00:53:05,166 --> 00:53:08,000
Guess there's really
not much to me, is there?

826
00:53:12,667 --> 00:53:14,917
That's all I am,
a good-looking lay?

827
00:53:17,333 --> 00:53:19,583
Aw, shit.

828
00:53:21,583 --> 00:53:23,417
Hey, what you doing?

829
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,250
Well, shit,
are you crying?

830
00:53:27,917 --> 00:53:29,458
Hey.

831
00:53:29,542 --> 00:53:31,125
Hey.

832
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:34,000
Hey, man...
I'm just talking, man.

833
00:53:34,083 --> 00:53:35,667
I don't mean nothing
by that.

834
00:53:35,750 --> 00:53:37,208
I'm just
fooling with ya.

835
00:53:37,291 --> 00:53:38,625
I'm crazy about you.

836
00:53:38,709 --> 00:53:40,000
God damn.

837
00:53:40,083 --> 00:53:41,709
I didn't mean nothing
by that.

838
00:53:43,625 --> 00:53:46,041
Huh? Huh?

839
00:53:46,959 --> 00:53:48,875
You're okay, T.

840
00:53:48,959 --> 00:53:51,208
You better get
out of here while
there's still time.

841
00:53:52,542 --> 00:53:54,250
What are you
talking about?

842
00:53:55,875 --> 00:53:57,250
I'm dead.

843
00:53:58,291 --> 00:54:00,083
Don't you know that?

844
00:54:01,959 --> 00:54:04,250
How did you like
fucking a dead girl?

845
00:54:09,250 --> 00:54:11,125
What?

846
00:54:11,208 --> 00:54:14,500
You--- you talking about that--
that boyfriend of yours?

847
00:54:14,583 --> 00:54:16,375
What, are you
scared of him?

848
00:54:16,458 --> 00:54:18,208
He's coming for me.

849
00:54:18,291 --> 00:54:20,834
And when he finds me,
he's gonna kill me.

850
00:54:24,166 --> 00:54:25,542
Why?

851
00:54:25,625 --> 00:54:28,250
He thinks I crossed him.

852
00:54:29,625 --> 00:54:31,125
Did you?

853
00:54:32,583 --> 00:54:34,125
No.

854
00:54:35,625 --> 00:54:38,250
Well, maybe you
should talk to him.

855
00:54:38,333 --> 00:54:42,417
I tried.
Talking's not what he wants.

856
00:54:45,583 --> 00:54:47,750
Maybe you and me
could go away,
you know?

857
00:54:47,834 --> 00:54:49,417
Like maybe
we could, like,
run away together.

858
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:52,750
I've been running.

859
00:54:52,834 --> 00:54:55,709
I can't run far enough
or fast enough.

860
00:54:56,709 --> 00:54:58,125
He's gonna find me.

861
00:54:58,208 --> 00:55:00,583
And when he does,
he's gonna kill me.

862
00:55:00,667 --> 00:55:02,583
And if he
finds you here,

863
00:55:02,667 --> 00:55:04,208
he'll probably
kill you, too.

864
00:55:08,041 --> 00:55:09,709
I'm not scared of him.

865
00:55:15,208 --> 00:55:16,667
I'm not leaving.

866
00:55:18,333 --> 00:55:19,917
I'm gonna stay with you.

867
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,542
I'm gonna protect you.

868
00:55:23,625 --> 00:55:25,375
You're gonna protect me?

869
00:55:25,458 --> 00:55:28,291
An out-of-work brewer
who can't even buy
his own fries?

870
00:55:28,375 --> 00:55:31,250
I know you
mean well, T,

871
00:55:31,333 --> 00:55:33,083
but you let one good fuck
go straight to your head.

872
00:55:33,166 --> 00:55:36,375
Hey, I said I was
gonna protect you,
and I meant it.

873
00:55:39,417 --> 00:55:41,000
Would you?

874
00:55:41,083 --> 00:55:43,709
What would you do
when he comes for me?

875
00:55:47,208 --> 00:55:49,000
What would you do, T?

876
00:55:49,083 --> 00:55:51,583
Would you kill him
for me? Would you do that?

877
00:56:09,250 --> 00:56:11,000
-Here.
-What?

878
00:56:11,083 --> 00:56:13,000
What am I
supposed to do
with this?

879
00:56:13,083 --> 00:56:14,750
You're supposed to
shoot it at the crate.

880
00:56:14,834 --> 00:56:16,917
I don't know how
to shoot that gun.

881
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,542
I'm gonna teach you.
Take it.

882
00:56:23,417 --> 00:56:25,208
Aim at the crate.

883
00:56:25,291 --> 00:56:26,542
No, no.

884
00:56:26,625 --> 00:56:27,875
You use one hand.

885
00:56:27,959 --> 00:56:29,792
Get used to firing
with one hand, okay?

886
00:56:29,875 --> 00:56:31,709
It's quicker,
and you have to learn
how to take the kick.

887
00:56:31,792 --> 00:56:33,500
-Yeah.
-Don't grip too tight.

888
00:56:33,583 --> 00:56:35,291
Can't be afraid
of the gun.

889
00:56:35,375 --> 00:56:36,875
As long as you're
on this side of it,
she's your friend.

890
00:56:36,959 --> 00:56:39,000
Okay, she's my friend.

891
00:56:39,083 --> 00:56:41,542
Relax your arm.
Hold it steady. Okay.

892
00:56:41,625 --> 00:56:43,375
-Straighten your sights?
-Yeah.

893
00:56:43,458 --> 00:56:46,333
Slowly squeeze the trigger.
Don't jerk it.

894
00:56:46,417 --> 00:56:48,291
Even pressure.

895
00:56:49,291 --> 00:56:50,542
Keep squeezing.

896
00:56:50,625 --> 00:56:52,166
Wait a minute.

897
00:56:52,250 --> 00:56:53,875
Come on, come on.

898
00:56:53,959 --> 00:56:55,458
Come on, come on.

899
00:56:55,542 --> 00:56:56,875
God damn it!
You take it.

900
00:56:56,959 --> 00:56:58,625
I don't wanna
shoot that gun.

901
00:57:06,250 --> 00:57:08,500
It's that easy, T,
like using a doorknob,

902
00:57:08,583 --> 00:57:10,917
except with a gun,
someone gets dead.

903
00:57:11,291 --> 00:57:12,959
Jesus!

904
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
Jesus Christ!

905
00:57:16,083 --> 00:57:17,583
Damn!

906
00:57:17,667 --> 00:57:19,583
You said you were
gonna protect me.

907
00:57:19,667 --> 00:57:22,917
Yeah, I know,
but I mean, come on!

908
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,709
You said you wanted
to stay with me,

909
00:57:24,792 --> 00:57:27,083
that we'd be together.
Don't you wanna be together?

910
00:57:27,166 --> 00:57:28,834
Oh, baby, yeah.

911
00:57:28,917 --> 00:57:31,583
Hell, I wanna be together.
I'm crazy about you.

912
00:57:31,667 --> 00:57:33,417
Someone is coming
to kill me, T.

913
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:34,834
What are you gonna do
when he gets here,

914
00:57:34,917 --> 00:57:36,667
call him names
until he busts out crying?

915
00:57:36,750 --> 00:57:38,834
I don't know
what the fuck
I'm gonna do!

916
00:57:45,041 --> 00:57:46,792
I never killed a man
before.

917
00:57:46,875 --> 00:57:50,417
Killing a man isn't
something you work up to.

918
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:52,291
All it takes
is one good try.

919
00:57:56,375 --> 00:57:59,458
That'll be $19.35.

920
00:57:59,542 --> 00:58:00,959
How much further
to 15?

921
00:58:01,041 --> 00:58:02,792
Couple hours
if you drive steady.

922
00:58:02,875 --> 00:58:04,875
Ought to make it
to town by nightfall.

923
00:58:04,959 --> 00:58:06,250
Thanks a lot.

924
00:58:13,375 --> 00:58:15,125
What's that for?

925
00:58:15,208 --> 00:58:17,208
This is where
you get off.

926
00:58:19,834 --> 00:58:22,250
Ned, you don't have to
do this, man.

927
00:58:22,333 --> 00:58:24,458
-Let's just drive.
-Drive where?

928
00:58:24,542 --> 00:58:27,458
To anywhere. Let's go
to Canada, like you said.

929
00:58:27,542 --> 00:58:29,417
You know?
We can go together.

930
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:31,834
Not like there's anything
between us or nothing.
I'm just saying--

931
00:58:31,917 --> 00:58:34,458
I have to find Jude.
I have to find--

932
00:58:34,542 --> 00:58:38,125
Forget about Jude, man! Leave--
Why can't you just leave her be?

933
00:58:38,208 --> 00:58:39,667
-It's too late.
-What does she matter?

934
00:58:39,750 --> 00:58:41,166
-No.
-It is too late.

935
00:58:41,250 --> 00:58:42,667
-It is not too late.
-It is...

936
00:58:42,750 --> 00:58:44,667
...too late.

937
00:58:48,917 --> 00:58:50,750
Look...

938
00:58:52,750 --> 00:58:54,625
This is like
a runaway train.

939
00:58:54,709 --> 00:58:56,834
Okay?

940
00:58:56,917 --> 00:58:59,834
It won't stop.
It's moving too fast
for me to get off.

941
00:58:59,917 --> 00:59:01,875
I gotta take it
to the end of the line.

942
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,917
But this is not
right for you.

943
00:59:13,250 --> 00:59:15,083
Okay.

944
00:59:15,583 --> 00:59:17,083
Okay.

945
01:00:22,083 --> 01:00:24,083
Stand up, Ned.

946
01:00:24,166 --> 01:00:27,625
Stand up, or I swear
to God, I'll shoot you
where you are.

947
01:00:34,375 --> 01:00:36,125
Who the hell are you?

948
01:00:38,166 --> 01:00:40,041
Don't move, Jude.

949
01:00:41,041 --> 01:00:43,166
Put it down.

950
01:00:47,125 --> 01:00:50,792
Sorry to drop in on you
unexpected like this, honey.

951
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
Oh, Ned,
you're not unexpected.

952
01:00:58,667 --> 01:01:01,250
-Hey, T.
-Hey, Ned.

953
01:01:01,333 --> 01:01:04,375
Thanks for keeping an eye
on things for me.

954
01:01:05,458 --> 01:01:07,375
Wasn't nothin'.

955
01:01:07,458 --> 01:01:09,333
Wasn't nothin'
at all.

956
01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:13,834
You son of a bitch!

957
01:01:15,417 --> 01:01:17,333
Come here.

958
01:01:21,709 --> 01:01:23,125
Fuck.

959
01:01:23,208 --> 01:01:24,709
Ouch.

960
01:01:25,542 --> 01:01:27,500
Ouch. I know how you think.

961
01:01:27,583 --> 01:01:29,583
I had you figured
all the way, honey.

962
01:01:29,667 --> 01:01:31,500
She wanted me
to kill you, man.

963
01:01:31,583 --> 01:01:33,667
What?
You wanted me dead?

964
01:01:33,750 --> 01:01:35,000
Oh, it's
not like that.

965
01:01:35,083 --> 01:01:36,500
I wanted some
protection,

966
01:01:36,583 --> 01:01:37,834
but it's not
like you think.

967
01:01:37,917 --> 01:01:39,500
Ned, I knew you
were coming for me.

968
01:01:39,583 --> 01:01:42,333
I could've--
I could've run,
but I stayed put.

969
01:01:42,417 --> 01:01:43,917
You knew I'd find you,
right?

970
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,125
I just wanted
to talk things out.

971
01:01:45,208 --> 01:01:46,417
I never wanted
anybody to get hurt.

972
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:47,667
That's why I wanted
some protection--

973
01:01:47,750 --> 01:01:49,291
No good with
the dancing, honey.

974
01:01:49,375 --> 01:01:51,875
Oh, fuck! It's
the truth, Ned.
It's the truth.

975
01:01:52,750 --> 01:01:54,208
Bye, Jude.

976
01:01:54,291 --> 01:01:56,375
-Ned--
-Do it, man. Do it.

977
01:01:56,458 --> 01:01:58,625
Yeah. Do it.

978
01:01:58,709 --> 01:01:59,959
Kill me.

979
01:02:00,041 --> 01:02:02,709
Oh, and you do...

980
01:02:02,792 --> 01:02:04,542
You'll never see
those jewels again.

981
01:02:04,625 --> 01:02:07,166
That's what
it's all about, isn't it?

982
01:02:07,250 --> 01:02:09,291
Isn't it?

983
01:02:17,583 --> 01:02:20,875
You sure know how to break
a girl's heart. Ohh!

984
01:02:20,959 --> 01:02:23,875
And here I was thinking
you came all this way for me.

985
01:02:23,959 --> 01:02:26,709
-Where are they?
-Put that thing away.

986
01:02:26,792 --> 01:02:28,125
You look like
a dime store cowboy.

987
01:02:28,208 --> 01:02:29,875
Fuck you, Jude.
Where are they?

988
01:02:29,959 --> 01:02:31,834
Who gives a fuck
about the jewels?
Just shoot her!

989
01:02:31,917 --> 01:02:34,500
She wanted
to shoot you, man!
I say shoot her!

990
01:02:34,583 --> 01:02:36,041
Nobody cares what you say.

991
01:02:36,125 --> 01:02:37,583
Why don't you go take
a couple of drop-dead pills?

992
01:02:37,667 --> 01:02:40,417
-Jude!
-I don't have them.

993
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:42,542
Coke Bottles
ripped me off.
I went to fence them...

994
01:02:42,625 --> 01:02:45,166
-To get money
to get out of town.
-To get rid of them.

995
01:02:45,250 --> 01:02:47,667
Heat's still on and I
didn't want to get pinched
carrying that stuff.

996
01:02:47,750 --> 01:02:49,542
Only Coke Bottles
has another idea.

997
01:02:49,625 --> 01:02:51,709
-He pulls a gun and just
takes what he wants.
-You just let him.

998
01:02:51,792 --> 01:02:53,750
What was I supposed to do,
go to the cops and tell them

999
01:02:53,834 --> 01:02:55,917
somebody just ripped off
the jewels I stole?

1000
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,917
That's the chance you take
when you're a woman alone--

1001
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,417
Always looking to get
ripped off by some man.

1002
01:03:02,458 --> 01:03:06,166
-What's that?
-I'm Bec.

1003
01:03:06,250 --> 01:03:08,375
Heard a lot about you, Jude.

1004
01:03:08,458 --> 01:03:11,000
Oh, she's cute.
Trained her
on the paper yet?

1005
01:03:14,250 --> 01:03:15,166
Where are they?

1006
01:03:15,250 --> 01:03:16,917
We can get them back.

1007
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:18,208
How?

1008
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:21,959
Same way we got them
in the first place.

1009
01:03:23,375 --> 01:03:24,875
Take them.

1010
01:03:28,166 --> 01:03:29,792
Hey, Ned, what
are we gonna do?

1011
01:03:29,875 --> 01:03:32,333
"We"? Who sent you
an invitation?

1012
01:03:33,166 --> 01:03:35,667
Ned! What are we
gonna do?

1013
01:03:37,792 --> 01:03:41,166
We... are gonna eat.

1014
01:04:00,166 --> 01:04:01,959
Hey. It's
Cindy Brady.

1015
01:04:02,041 --> 01:04:04,458
Hey.

1016
01:04:04,542 --> 01:04:06,333
I'm really glad
Ned didn't kill you.

1017
01:04:06,417 --> 01:04:08,417
Yeah. Well, me, too.

1018
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:10,083
I knew he wouldn't, though.
He likes you too much.

1019
01:04:10,166 --> 01:04:11,792
What tipped you off?

1020
01:04:11,875 --> 01:04:13,125
The way he threw me
across the room,

1021
01:04:13,208 --> 01:04:14,750
or the way he holds
a gun on me?

1022
01:04:14,834 --> 01:04:17,333
I can just tell.

1023
01:04:17,417 --> 01:04:19,375
You like him?

1024
01:04:21,834 --> 01:04:24,083
Yeah, I guess I do.

1025
01:04:24,166 --> 01:04:26,083
At least the only way
I know how.

1026
01:04:28,208 --> 01:04:31,959
What's it to you?
Got a little schoolgirl
crush on him? That it?

1027
01:04:32,041 --> 01:04:34,333
Maybe. He's been
good to me.

1028
01:04:34,417 --> 01:04:38,417
He did shoot uncle Mike
'cause he tried
to hurt me.

1029
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:40,375
He killed Mike?

1030
01:04:40,458 --> 01:04:41,834
-I don't know.
-Jesus.

1031
01:04:41,917 --> 01:04:43,375
I don't know
if he's dead or not.

1032
01:04:43,458 --> 01:04:45,166
I don't want to know.
I just know

1033
01:04:45,250 --> 01:04:48,000
that he stopped him
from hurting me,
that's all.

1034
01:04:48,083 --> 01:04:49,667
You can't help
but like a man

1035
01:04:49,750 --> 01:04:51,792
for shooting somebody
for you, right?

1036
01:04:51,875 --> 01:04:55,208
Don't go love simple.
Ned'd shoot you, too,
if you got in his way.

1037
01:04:55,291 --> 01:04:57,959
I know.

1038
01:04:58,041 --> 01:05:00,375
I know
you would, too.

1039
01:05:03,542 --> 01:05:06,667
So why did you murder
those three people?
Murder?

1040
01:05:06,750 --> 01:05:08,875
Yeah. Ned says
you killed three people
for no reason.

1041
01:05:08,959 --> 01:05:11,625
Is that what he says?
Yes.

1042
01:05:11,709 --> 01:05:13,333
Yeah, I shot
three people,

1043
01:05:13,417 --> 01:05:14,834
but it wasn't
for no reason.

1044
01:05:14,917 --> 01:05:17,000
Ned tell you about
the job we pulled?

1045
01:05:17,083 --> 01:05:19,291
We hit the store,
grabbed the jewels,

1046
01:05:19,375 --> 01:05:21,709
started heading
out the door, and
Ned turns his back.

1047
01:05:21,792 --> 01:05:23,917
He turned his back
on those people.

1048
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,083
You never turn your back.
One of them pulls a gun.

1049
01:05:26,166 --> 01:05:28,417
He would've opened Ned
wide the fuck up
if I hadn't shot him.

1050
01:05:28,500 --> 01:05:30,709
What about
the other two?

1051
01:05:30,792 --> 01:05:34,208
When things start getting
hectic, you can't sweat
the small stuff.

1052
01:05:34,291 --> 01:05:36,250
So, just like that.

1053
01:05:36,333 --> 01:05:38,875
Yeah, only he saves
your life, and you
go sweet on him.

1054
01:05:38,959 --> 01:05:41,375
I save his,
and he calls me
a murderer.

1055
01:05:41,458 --> 01:05:44,166
Sure, I'm the evil one.
Can't be trusted
for nothin'.

1056
01:05:44,250 --> 01:05:47,041
All I know is,
I didn't push Ned
out of that car.

1057
01:05:47,125 --> 01:05:51,000
Maybe you didn't push
him out. Maybe he just
fell out by accident.

1058
01:05:51,083 --> 01:05:54,208
Maybe. Or maybe
he figured he'd do
better on his own

1059
01:05:54,291 --> 01:05:56,417
with the cops
chasing me.

1060
01:05:56,500 --> 01:05:59,417
Last thing I remember
seeing is his hand
reaching for the jewels.

1061
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:01,000
And I'm the bad guy?

1062
01:06:01,083 --> 01:06:02,917
That's a man for you,
little girl--

1063
01:06:03,041 --> 01:06:05,208
Always looking
to take a woman down.

1064
01:06:05,291 --> 01:06:08,125
That's not true, Jude.
He saved me.

1065
01:06:09,542 --> 01:06:11,208
One good turn
a man does you.

1066
01:06:11,291 --> 01:06:13,250
How many times
has it been the
other way around?

1067
01:06:13,333 --> 01:06:15,542
How many times have you
gotten a man's affection

1068
01:06:15,625 --> 01:06:17,709
from the back
of his hand or
the end of his belt?

1069
01:06:21,166 --> 01:06:25,166
Yeah. I figured you'd
been on the getting end
once or twice.

1070
01:06:28,291 --> 01:06:30,542
My father.

1071
01:06:30,625 --> 01:06:32,458
You don't need to tell me.
He's a drunk, right?

1072
01:06:35,041 --> 01:06:37,041
Every time
he gets a fix on,

1073
01:06:37,125 --> 01:06:39,417
he thinks
he can do anything
he wants to you.

1074
01:06:39,500 --> 01:06:42,709
Gets so bad,
sometimes you think...

1075
01:06:42,792 --> 01:06:45,166
that you'd
rather wake up dead
than wake up at all.

1076
01:06:46,583 --> 01:06:49,166
We've all been there,
one way or another.

1077
01:06:49,250 --> 01:06:52,166
There's a war going on
between men and women,

1078
01:06:52,250 --> 01:06:55,792
and they got
all the advantages.
It's their world.

1079
01:06:55,875 --> 01:06:58,500
The only weapon
a woman's got
is her sex.

1080
01:06:58,583 --> 01:07:00,500
Wiggle your ass.
Smile, smile.

1081
01:07:00,583 --> 01:07:02,625
That'll bring a man
to his knees.

1082
01:07:02,709 --> 01:07:05,125
But use it, and
what do they call you?
A bitch and a whore.

1083
01:07:05,208 --> 01:07:07,417
And all we're trying
to do is survive
with what we got,

1084
01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:09,667
keep the score
somewhere close
to being even.

1085
01:07:09,750 --> 01:07:12,166
Yeah, but you
can't go around trying
to get even all the time.

1086
01:07:12,250 --> 01:07:14,000
Two wrongs don't
make a right.

1087
01:07:14,083 --> 01:07:16,166
You gotta give people
what's coming 'em
and take what's yours.

1088
01:07:16,250 --> 01:07:17,667
What goes around,
comes around.

1089
01:07:17,750 --> 01:07:20,000
Jesus!
It's like talking
to a fortune cookie.

1090
01:07:20,083 --> 01:07:23,500
You know,
it may sound stupid,
but I believe it.

1091
01:07:23,583 --> 01:07:25,792
I do. You have to
believe in something.

1092
01:07:25,875 --> 01:07:27,792
Don't you believe
in anything?

1093
01:07:46,375 --> 01:07:47,875
Where's Ned?

1094
01:07:47,959 --> 01:07:50,709
He's tired.
Went to bed.

1095
01:07:50,792 --> 01:07:53,083
My bed, no doubt.

1096
01:07:54,583 --> 01:07:57,041
Go on in there. I got a couple
sleeping bags in the car.

1097
01:07:57,125 --> 01:07:59,458
And lock the door
behind you.

1098
01:08:02,959 --> 01:08:04,542
Oh...

1099
01:08:04,625 --> 01:08:08,375
Hey, sorry about the way
things turned out, Jude,

1100
01:08:08,458 --> 01:08:10,875
'cause I thought
you and me were
real good together.

1101
01:08:10,959 --> 01:08:13,917
Put it in your diary, T.
It'll help keep
the memories alive.

1102
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
Hey. Hey.

1103
01:08:17,667 --> 01:08:20,375
You and me could keep on
being good together.

1104
01:08:20,458 --> 01:08:22,917
-How's that?
-Well, I don't know, uh...

1105
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,709
I don't know how much
those jewels you stole
are worth,

1106
01:08:25,792 --> 01:08:28,583
but I know that two
can go a lot further
on them than three.

1107
01:08:28,667 --> 01:08:31,250
You cutting Ned
out of it just like that?

1108
01:08:31,333 --> 01:08:34,583
Wouldn't you?
Come on, baby,
what am I talking here?

1109
01:08:34,667 --> 01:08:35,917
You already tried.

1110
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,041
If I did,
look how far it got me.

1111
01:08:38,125 --> 01:08:40,417
It's gonna be
different this time.

1112
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:42,375
You got me
backing you up.

1113
01:08:42,458 --> 01:08:45,834
Ooh. Let me buy
some of that stock.

1114
01:08:47,333 --> 01:08:48,333
Hey.

1115
01:08:51,333 --> 01:08:53,291
You know what?

1116
01:08:53,375 --> 01:08:55,792
I don't know whether
to kiss you or slap you.

1117
01:08:55,875 --> 01:08:57,542
What's the difference?

1118
01:09:04,875 --> 01:09:07,417
Just because
you got it once...

1119
01:09:07,500 --> 01:09:09,500
don't think
I give it away.

1120
01:09:11,375 --> 01:09:13,333
Slut.

1121
01:09:17,959 --> 01:09:19,500
What did you call me?

1122
01:09:32,250 --> 01:09:33,834
Called you a slut.

1123
01:09:36,250 --> 01:09:37,834
Do you know
what the difference

1124
01:09:37,917 --> 01:09:39,709
between a slut
and a bitch is?

1125
01:09:41,417 --> 01:09:43,959
A slut is a woman
who will sleep
with any man.

1126
01:09:44,041 --> 01:09:45,834
A bitch...

1127
01:09:45,917 --> 01:09:48,166
is a woman who will
sleep with any man...

1128
01:09:48,250 --> 01:09:50,208
except you.

1129
01:10:37,208 --> 01:10:39,375
Is this him?

1130
01:10:39,458 --> 01:10:42,458
I said Coke Bottles
is a pasty fuck
with glasses.

1131
01:10:42,542 --> 01:10:44,166
Does that guy look
like a pasty fuck?

1132
01:10:44,250 --> 01:10:46,875
Doesn't even
have glasses.

1133
01:10:46,959 --> 01:10:49,375
Well, where the hell is he?
We've been here all morning.

1134
01:10:49,458 --> 01:10:53,542
If you got someplace else
to be, T, don't let us stop you.

1135
01:10:53,625 --> 01:10:55,333
Hey, you gonna eat
that chili dog?

1136
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:02,333
Good arm.

1137
01:11:15,083 --> 01:11:18,417
You know, I have to admit,
you guys really put one over
on me.

1138
01:11:18,500 --> 01:11:20,083
The way you set me up.

1139
01:11:20,166 --> 01:11:21,750
Didn't see it coming.

1140
01:11:21,834 --> 01:11:23,250
Not for a second.

1141
01:11:23,333 --> 01:11:25,125
Good one, really.

1142
01:11:28,250 --> 01:11:30,458
Hey, Ned, how long
you and T been friends?

1143
01:11:32,667 --> 01:11:34,917
What difference
does it make?

1144
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,709
I don't know.
Just want to know
how close you two were.

1145
01:11:47,875 --> 01:11:49,291
T tell you we fucked?

1146
01:11:51,375 --> 01:11:53,083
When he was
supposed to be watching me,
he was fucking me,

1147
01:11:53,166 --> 01:11:54,959
but I guess
you already know that

1148
01:11:55,041 --> 01:11:56,875
'cause, you know,
you're good friends.

1149
01:11:57,875 --> 01:11:59,291
I was also wondering
if he told you

1150
01:11:59,375 --> 01:12:01,250
that after last night
when you went to sleep,

1151
01:12:01,333 --> 01:12:03,083
T was trying to sell me
on the idea

1152
01:12:03,166 --> 01:12:04,625
that, you know,
once we get the jewels back,

1153
01:12:04,709 --> 01:12:06,291
we ought to just
cut you out of the picture.

1154
01:12:08,166 --> 01:12:10,291
Yeah, he probably
told you that, too.

1155
01:12:10,375 --> 01:12:13,125
He was probably
just testing me to see
if I'd cross you.

1156
01:12:14,542 --> 01:12:16,208
Of course if he didn't
tell you,

1157
01:12:16,291 --> 01:12:18,667
then I wouldn't trust him
as far as I could throw a piano.

1158
01:12:18,750 --> 01:12:21,000
Would you shut
the fuck up?

1159
01:12:21,083 --> 01:12:23,166
Hard to get good help
nowadays, isn't it, Ned?

1160
01:12:25,542 --> 01:12:27,000
She's lying.

1161
01:12:28,333 --> 01:12:30,375
What, are you gonna
believe that?

1162
01:12:31,750 --> 01:12:33,667
After what she did
to you?

1163
01:12:33,750 --> 01:12:35,250
Hey, this is T
sitting here.

1164
01:12:35,333 --> 01:12:37,041
I'd never
cross you, Ned.

1165
01:12:37,750 --> 01:12:39,417
Come on, man!

1166
01:12:44,583 --> 01:12:46,166
It's not gonna work,
Jude.

1167
01:12:46,250 --> 01:12:48,083
That may work
with some of the boys,

1168
01:12:48,166 --> 01:12:50,208
but you're not
going to get any mileage
out of me with it.

1169
01:12:52,542 --> 01:12:54,166
Sorry.

1170
01:13:00,792 --> 01:13:01,834
Hey, hey, that's him.

1171
01:13:01,917 --> 01:13:03,625
Told you.

1172
01:13:03,709 --> 01:13:06,500
Pasty fuck.
Look at those glasses.

1173
01:13:06,583 --> 01:13:07,875
Strong enough
to make the dead see.

1174
01:13:07,959 --> 01:13:10,041
I'm not talking about
a lake in Israel.

1175
01:13:10,125 --> 01:13:12,166
That bastard.

1176
01:13:12,250 --> 01:13:14,166
Pay for what he did to me.

1177
01:13:14,250 --> 01:13:16,417
I'd like to cut him
to bits myself.

1178
01:13:21,291 --> 01:13:23,375
Hey, how about we get
another round of smoothies?

1179
01:13:23,458 --> 01:13:25,041
Here's the setup.

1180
01:13:25,125 --> 01:13:26,875
The front door works
on a buzzer,

1181
01:13:26,959 --> 01:13:28,667
security camera covers it.

1182
01:13:28,750 --> 01:13:30,208
Coke Bottles is on
the second floor.

1183
01:13:30,291 --> 01:13:31,709
Two flights of stairs.

1184
01:13:31,792 --> 01:13:33,375
They're narrow with not
a lot of room to move.

1185
01:13:33,458 --> 01:13:35,375
Bad place to get stuck.

1186
01:13:35,458 --> 01:13:37,500
Coke Bottles' office
has got a fence around it.

1187
01:13:37,583 --> 01:13:39,500
That door works
on a buzzer, too.

1188
01:13:39,583 --> 01:13:41,000
After that?

1189
01:13:41,083 --> 01:13:43,291
Nothing.
Just an empty loft.

1190
01:13:45,583 --> 01:13:47,250
Not much
of a setup.

1191
01:13:47,333 --> 01:13:49,208
He's a fence.
He doesn't keep a lot
of merchandise around.

1192
01:13:49,291 --> 01:13:50,750
He's got to keep it moving.

1193
01:13:50,834 --> 01:13:52,375
How do you know he's
still got the jewels?

1194
01:13:52,458 --> 01:13:54,083
Told me they're
too hot to move.

1195
01:13:54,166 --> 01:13:55,583
He's still got them.

1196
01:13:59,333 --> 01:14:01,792
Okay. Here's how
we work it.

1197
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:05,667
I set up a meeting with him,

1198
01:14:05,750 --> 01:14:06,917
tell him I've got some
merchandise to move.

1199
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:08,667
- What?
 -Taylor.

1200
01:14:08,750 --> 01:14:10,583
T comes along
 for backup.

1201
01:14:10,667 --> 01:14:12,917
We got to sneak you
past the camera.

1202
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:14,834
Oh, that's not a problem.

1203
01:14:16,750 --> 01:14:18,417
Once we get inside,
we play it straight

1204
01:14:18,500 --> 01:14:20,083
till we're sure
everything is cool.

1205
01:14:20,166 --> 01:14:23,166
Any trouble, T is
half a step behind me.

1206
01:14:26,875 --> 01:14:30,417
The last thing I've got to do
is take care of the fence door.

1207
01:14:32,291 --> 01:14:35,959
If the rest of it's
like Jude says,
then we hit him.

1208
01:14:36,041 --> 01:14:38,417
Then beat it back down
to the car, and I'll get
us out of there.

1209
01:14:38,500 --> 01:14:40,917
-Nope.
-What do you mean, no?

1210
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,291
-As in you're not driving.
-You got to have a car.

1211
01:14:43,375 --> 01:14:45,250
I know that.
She's driving.

1212
01:14:45,333 --> 01:14:46,917
-Her?
-Mm-hm.

1213
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,291
- She can't drive.
- Turn the wheel and go fast.

1214
01:14:49,375 --> 01:14:51,709
Have you lost your mind?
What if something goes wrong?

1215
01:14:51,792 --> 01:14:53,458
She's not gonna be able
to get you out of there.

1216
01:14:53,542 --> 01:14:55,125
-She's driving.
-You're crazy.

1217
01:14:55,208 --> 01:14:57,208
Will you stop it
with those goddamn
pictures?

1218
01:14:57,291 --> 01:14:59,917
I've never seen
a crime planned before.

1219
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,458
Bec is driving.
That's final.

1220
01:15:02,542 --> 01:15:06,000
If Jude wants to drive,
it's okay. Really.

1221
01:15:06,083 --> 01:15:08,291
I think my driver's license
is expired.

1222
01:15:08,375 --> 01:15:09,500
Thank you very much.

1223
01:15:09,583 --> 01:15:11,333
But I've had enough
of Jude's driving.

1224
01:15:11,417 --> 01:15:13,625
You're behind the wheel.

1225
01:15:13,709 --> 01:15:16,583
And what am I
supposed to do
until you get back?

1226
01:15:17,709 --> 01:15:18,959
Why don't you
catch Ricki Lake?

1227
01:15:19,041 --> 01:15:21,000
She's always talking
about some shit.

1228
01:15:24,875 --> 01:15:26,750
How do I even know
you're coming back?

1229
01:15:26,834 --> 01:15:28,500
What's to keep the three
of you from, you know,

1230
01:15:28,583 --> 01:15:30,000
lighting out of here
with the jewels?

1231
01:15:30,083 --> 01:15:31,834
You don't,
which will give you

1232
01:15:31,917 --> 01:15:34,291
something to think about
while we're gone.

1233
01:15:34,375 --> 01:15:35,667
Coke Bottles.

1234
01:15:35,750 --> 01:15:37,834
Yeah?

1235
01:15:37,917 --> 01:15:40,667
- I'm Taylor.
- Sure you are.

1236
01:15:42,041 --> 01:15:43,333
I don't care
what you call yourself.

1237
01:15:43,417 --> 01:15:45,500
I'm only interested
in what you got to move.

1238
01:15:45,583 --> 01:15:46,834
I want a good price.

1239
01:15:46,917 --> 01:15:50,458
Best on the market,
minus 35 for my cut.

1240
01:15:50,542 --> 01:15:54,208
If what you got is
as good as you said
on the phone.

1241
01:15:54,291 --> 01:15:55,917
I think you're going
to like it.

1242
01:15:56,583 --> 01:15:58,542
Let's take a look.

1243
01:15:59,375 --> 01:16:01,208
Ooh, gun.

1244
01:16:01,291 --> 01:16:04,291
-Ooh. T!
-Yeah.

1245
01:16:06,041 --> 01:16:08,542
What? What are you,
some fucking cop?

1246
01:16:08,625 --> 01:16:10,083
I didn't do nothing.

1247
01:16:13,625 --> 01:16:16,041
Now, I want the jewels.

1248
01:16:16,125 --> 01:16:18,542
Uh, what jewels?

1249
01:16:18,625 --> 01:16:20,625
A lady came in here
to fence some jewels.

1250
01:16:20,709 --> 01:16:23,959
You took them off her.
I want them back.

1251
01:16:25,875 --> 01:16:27,375
You're her guy,
ain't you,

1252
01:16:27,458 --> 01:16:29,375
the one that got dumped
back in Arizona?

1253
01:16:29,458 --> 01:16:32,375
That's me.

1254
01:16:32,458 --> 01:16:34,583
The jewels.

1255
01:16:34,667 --> 01:16:37,208
You're a fucking idiot.
You know that?

1256
01:16:42,083 --> 01:16:44,750
Aah!

1257
01:16:45,625 --> 01:16:47,166
Son of a bitch!

1258
01:16:47,250 --> 01:16:48,417
Shoot him in the leg.
He'll talk.

1259
01:16:48,500 --> 01:16:50,792
You don't know
what you're doing!

1260
01:16:51,667 --> 01:16:53,417
Shoot him
in the fucking leg.

1261
01:16:53,500 --> 01:16:55,333
Whoa!

1262
01:17:50,959 --> 01:17:52,834
You killed Alfred!

1263
01:18:06,417 --> 01:18:08,917
Now, give me the jewels.

1264
01:18:14,417 --> 01:18:19,208
Man, you really are
a fucking idiot.

1265
01:18:20,250 --> 01:18:21,417
You said that.

1266
01:18:24,250 --> 01:18:25,750
You don't get it.

1267
01:18:26,917 --> 01:18:28,959
I don't have them.

1268
01:18:29,041 --> 01:18:30,250
Never did.

1269
01:18:31,750 --> 01:18:35,291
She came in here,
she tried to get tough.

1270
01:18:35,375 --> 01:18:36,709
I let her go.

1271
01:18:36,792 --> 01:18:38,750
Big mistake.

1272
01:18:40,125 --> 01:18:41,500
She set you up.

1273
01:18:44,208 --> 01:18:45,792
Set us both up.

1274
01:18:47,583 --> 01:18:49,875
And you bought it.

1275
01:18:49,959 --> 01:18:52,333
She played you
like a record,

1276
01:18:52,417 --> 01:18:55,000
and you bought it.

1277
01:18:55,083 --> 01:18:57,542
You are an idiot, man.

1278
01:18:57,625 --> 01:18:59,458
You are an idiot!

1279
01:19:07,208 --> 01:19:09,667
Start the car.
Bec, start the car!

1280
01:19:13,375 --> 01:19:15,208
My God, you're shot!

1281
01:19:15,291 --> 01:19:16,375
Drive!

1282
01:19:30,333 --> 01:19:32,542
Yeah, I need a cab.

1283
01:19:32,625 --> 01:19:34,125
Taking a trip?

1284
01:19:44,250 --> 01:19:48,083
-I knew you'd cut out.
-I was going to go look
for you--

1285
01:19:48,166 --> 01:19:49,667
-Lie. Lie!
-Yeah, what the hell happened?

1286
01:19:49,750 --> 01:19:52,250
-Lie, Jude.
-Ned.

1287
01:19:52,333 --> 01:19:55,083
-Where are the jewels?
-What are you talking about?

1288
01:19:55,166 --> 01:19:56,417
You are a fucking liar.

1289
01:19:56,500 --> 01:19:58,542
Coke Bottles took 'em--

1290
01:19:58,625 --> 01:20:00,083
Oh, my--

1291
01:20:00,166 --> 01:20:03,291
Jesus Christ.
Lay off the face!

1292
01:20:03,375 --> 01:20:05,583
Jude, you have
one more chance at this.

1293
01:20:05,667 --> 01:20:07,709
Where are those
fucking jewels?

1294
01:20:07,792 --> 01:20:10,959
I went to coke Bottles,
and he ripped me off,
just like I said.

1295
01:20:11,041 --> 01:20:13,417
Wrong. Let's work it
another way.

1296
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:15,125
You went to
Coke Bottles, and
you took some heat,

1297
01:20:15,208 --> 01:20:17,250
but he didn't take them
off you, did he?

1298
01:20:17,333 --> 01:20:19,250
So you sent me
over there to kill him

1299
01:20:19,333 --> 01:20:20,792
or he was going
to kill me,

1300
01:20:20,875 --> 01:20:22,417
or better yet,
we were going to kill
each other.

1301
01:20:22,500 --> 01:20:23,959
That would be the best.

1302
01:20:24,041 --> 01:20:26,125
But it didn't work out
that way, did it, Jude?

1303
01:20:26,208 --> 01:20:28,750
You planned
this whole thing.

1304
01:20:28,834 --> 01:20:32,166
Just like you planned
on never coming back
for me.

1305
01:20:37,625 --> 01:20:40,750
Honey, so help me,
I'll kill you for this.

1306
01:20:42,208 --> 01:20:44,500
We've been here before, Ned.

1307
01:20:44,583 --> 01:20:47,750
You pull that trigger now,
and you walk away
with nothing.

1308
01:20:49,750 --> 01:20:51,583
That the way
you're gonna play it?

1309
01:21:00,542 --> 01:21:02,250
Mmm.

1310
01:21:18,041 --> 01:21:19,500
That's better.

1311
01:21:19,583 --> 01:21:21,917
Now you're thinking
with your head.

1312
01:21:24,458 --> 01:21:26,291
We can work
something out.

1313
01:21:30,125 --> 01:21:31,041
-Where...
-Oh!

1314
01:21:31,125 --> 01:21:32,542
-Are...
-God!

1315
01:21:32,625 --> 01:21:34,041
-The jewels?
-Ned!

1316
01:21:34,125 --> 01:21:35,542
Oh, God!

1317
01:21:36,583 --> 01:21:37,542
Come on, Jude.

1318
01:21:37,625 --> 01:21:39,000
Oh, God!

1319
01:21:39,083 --> 01:21:40,750
I'll beat it
out of you.

1320
01:21:45,250 --> 01:21:46,542
Ned, stop.
You're going to kill her.

1321
01:21:46,625 --> 01:21:48,291
Stop!

1322
01:21:51,125 --> 01:21:52,792
Ned, stop!

1323
01:21:55,959 --> 01:21:58,375
No!

1324
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:27,875
What the hell
did you do?

1325
01:22:27,959 --> 01:22:30,500
I shot him.

1326
01:22:30,583 --> 01:22:32,709
Why?!

1327
01:22:32,792 --> 01:22:35,542
You saw how he was.
He was just like my father.

1328
01:22:35,625 --> 01:22:37,000
I had to shoot him!

1329
01:22:39,667 --> 01:22:42,000
Let's go. Come on, I gotta
get us out of here. Come on.

1330
01:23:05,041 --> 01:23:07,166
Come on. Come on.
Come on.

1331
01:23:24,542 --> 01:23:26,250
Let's go.

1332
01:23:36,417 --> 01:23:37,667
Hey, Jude.

1333
01:23:39,417 --> 01:23:40,875
What...

1334
01:23:44,417 --> 01:23:47,500
You little bitch.

1335
01:23:47,583 --> 01:23:50,417
I'd like to think I learned
a few things from you, Jude.

1336
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:54,750
Toss 'em.

1337
01:24:06,917 --> 01:24:08,458
Do me a favor, okay?

1338
01:24:10,291 --> 01:24:11,917
Just not
in the face.

1339
01:24:19,750 --> 01:24:21,583
Do it!

1340
01:24:22,959 --> 01:24:24,792
Go on and do it!

1341
01:24:58,166 --> 01:25:00,583
What the hell
happened to us?

1342
01:25:00,667 --> 01:25:03,667
Oh, God.
I don't know.

1343
01:25:03,750 --> 01:25:07,458
Guess we just
sort of lost our way.

1344
01:25:11,333 --> 01:25:14,792
The bitch of it is
I love you.

1345
01:25:17,166 --> 01:25:19,083
I'm sorry.

1346
01:25:20,667 --> 01:25:22,500
I'm sorry.

1347
01:25:34,792 --> 01:25:38,041
Shh. It's okay.

1348
01:25:38,125 --> 01:25:41,458
It's okay.
Doesn't matter anymore.

1349
01:25:43,792 --> 01:25:45,792
No, Ned. I mean it.

1350
01:25:45,875 --> 01:25:47,291
I'm sorry.

1351
01:26:12,542 --> 01:26:14,583
-Looking for these?
-Oh.

1352
01:26:18,417 --> 01:26:20,417
I'll do it quick.

1353
01:26:20,500 --> 01:26:22,250
You won't feel a thing.

1354
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:29,500
Unh.

1355
01:26:37,250 --> 01:26:38,500
Take 'em.

1356
01:26:38,583 --> 01:26:41,333
Take the keys
and go.

1357
01:27:18,709 --> 01:27:20,458
Ah.

1358
01:27:20,542 --> 01:27:21,792
What?

1359
01:27:21,875 --> 01:27:24,709
I was thinking...
about...

1360
01:27:24,792 --> 01:27:26,917
...Jeannie.

1361
01:27:30,083 --> 01:27:32,792
God...
and Jeannie...

1362
01:27:34,041 --> 01:27:35,125
...in a fight.

1363
01:27:35,208 --> 01:27:37,000
That's
fucking funny.

1364
01:27:54,750 --> 01:27:56,291
Unh.

1365
01:28:25,834 --> 01:28:28,083
That's it.
That's all I know.

1366
01:28:28,166 --> 01:28:31,041
That's how it happened.

1367
01:28:31,125 --> 01:28:33,458
Pretty much, anyway.

1368
01:28:33,542 --> 01:28:36,625
Maybe I made it
sound better in parts.

1369
01:28:36,709 --> 01:28:38,458
A little more romantic.

1370
01:28:42,208 --> 01:28:44,375
But that's pretty much
how it happened.

1371
01:29:09,208 --> 01:29:11,083
Captain.

1372
01:29:12,250 --> 01:29:13,625
What have you got?

1373
01:29:13,709 --> 01:29:16,166
We found enough of 'em
to make a positive ID.

1374
01:29:16,250 --> 01:29:17,959
It's the two
we've been looking for.

1375
01:29:18,041 --> 01:29:21,083
We also came across
a few of these.

1376
01:29:22,250 --> 01:29:24,083
The rest are probably
scattered around.

1377
01:29:24,166 --> 01:29:27,250
Doesn't look like much
worth dying for,
does it?

1378
01:29:28,750 --> 01:29:30,500
You want I should
book the girl?

1379
01:29:30,583 --> 01:29:33,959
What for?
It's not worth it.

1380
01:29:34,041 --> 01:29:36,750
Call her father
and arrange for her
to be sent home.

1381
01:29:44,959 --> 01:29:49,166
Here you are.
It's a one-way ticket
back home.

1382
01:29:49,250 --> 01:29:51,583
Your father will be waiting
when you get there.

1383
01:29:55,917 --> 01:29:57,959
I really ought
to wait here with you.

1384
01:29:58,041 --> 01:30:01,792
I'll be all right,
you know, if you
have to go somewhere.

1385
01:30:01,875 --> 01:30:04,834
Heh. Yeah.

1386
01:30:04,917 --> 01:30:06,625
I'm not gonna run away.

1387
01:30:06,709 --> 01:30:08,917
I have no place
to run to, so...

1388
01:30:12,792 --> 01:30:15,625
The Rocky Mountain
 Limited from Denver, Colorado,

1389
01:30:15,709 --> 01:30:19,375
scheduled to arrive at 4:30,
will be delayed 30 minutes.

1390
01:30:19,458 --> 01:30:21,041
Remember, if your father
gives you any more trouble--

1391
01:30:21,125 --> 01:30:23,875
I know. Call the cops.

1392
01:30:23,959 --> 01:30:25,834
You guys are real helpful.

1393
01:30:29,917 --> 01:30:32,333
The train
from Denver will now arrive

1394
01:30:32,417 --> 01:30:35,125
on the west track at 5:00 p.m.

1395
01:30:39,458 --> 01:30:42,041
The Coast
Starlight train number 418

1396
01:30:42,125 --> 01:30:45,583
to Vancouver, B.C.,
with stops in San Francisco,

1397
01:30:45,667 --> 01:30:49,500
Portland, and Seattle,
now boarding on the east track.

1398
01:30:51,625 --> 01:30:53,709
I want to cash this in
for another one.

1399
01:30:53,792 --> 01:30:56,333
-To where?
-Canada.

1400
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,000
Got a train that leaves
in about eight minutes.

1401
01:31:01,083 --> 01:31:03,208
Makes a couple of connections,
but it'll get you to Vancouver.

1402
01:31:03,291 --> 01:31:04,750
I'll take it.

1403
01:31:04,834 --> 01:31:07,166
All right. Run you
an extra $42.38.

1404
01:31:09,875 --> 01:31:11,917
I don't have $42.

1405
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:15,959
What do you think,
we're giving rides away?

1406
01:31:16,041 --> 01:31:18,709
The Coast
Starlight train number 418

1407
01:31:18,792 --> 01:31:20,792
now boarding
on the east track.

1408
01:31:20,875 --> 01:31:25,834
I have this.
It's worth $2,000.
Maybe more.

1409
01:31:28,208 --> 01:31:29,417
It's real.

1410
01:31:29,500 --> 01:31:32,792
Well, if it's not,
then I'm out 42 bucks.

1411
01:31:32,875 --> 01:31:36,333
And if it is, you don't
have to come to work
next week.

1412
01:31:50,917 --> 01:31:53,083
One-way, Vancouver.

1413
01:31:54,417 --> 01:31:55,709
Thank you.

1414
01:31:57,333 --> 01:31:59,792
