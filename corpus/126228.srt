1
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,956
- What's wrong?
- l'm just tired.

2
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:13,909
Have you travelled far?

3
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,799
Yeah.

4
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,071
You're a surfer, aren't you?

5
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,231
Yeah, l'm a surfer.

6
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:31,234
l always wanted to try that.

7
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:35,075
lt seems like it would be
so much fun.

8
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:39,153
Yeah, it can be.
lt depends.

9
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:44,269
- On what?
- On if you make it your whole life.

10
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:47,557
Have you?

11
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,511
l guess ...

12
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,997
What if l told you there's a wave
out there, -

13
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:05,599
- and when it hits a little island
off Mexico, it will be massive.

14
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:09,992
And all l can think about
is riding it.

15
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,798
So you want to surf, -

16
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:39,475
- and the waves where you live
aren't half bad.

17
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:43,428
And you start to improve ...

18
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,355
And then you hear about this wave
in a far-away country, -

19
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:53,640
- whose name you can't
even pronounce. What then?

20
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,671
How far are you willing to go?

21
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,232
What sacrifice
are you willing to make?

22
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,632
How good do you really want to be?

23
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,798
Ow ... ow ...

24
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,554
Man, this hurts.

25
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:56,350
Mickey! You promised.

26
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,877
So beautiful ...

27
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:08,470
We're dead.

28
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:13,917
Don't worry.
l'm just teaching her English.

29
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:27,508
l've watched him ride for four days.
As an expert, l know -

30
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:33,949
- he's one of those rare athletes
whose spirit matches their talent.

31
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:38,477
l think he's preparing himself
for something extraordinary.

32
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:43,395
lf l can do anything to help him,
l will.

33
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:54,837
Mickey's at it again.
He says he's teaching her English.

34
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,958
He's teaching her something.

35
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:02,033
- Ladies first.
- Ladies first.

36
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,919
How are you?

37
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:08,197
l am fine.

38
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:13,559
Your eyes are very beautiful.

39
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:18,388
And you are so very handsome.

40
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,472
And so strong.

41
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,958
Very good.

42
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:29,715
Now if you really want
to learn English ...

43
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:37,870
You listen to Country music.
They tell it like it is.

44
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:42,158
''You give your hand to me ...''

45
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,959
''... and then you say hello ...''

46
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,392
lt sounds like your daddy's here.

47
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,238
l'm really sorry, sir.
l was just teaching her English.

48
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:03,155
- There are lots of girls, Mickey.
- You have to pick the right one.

49
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:09,156
You've got to make them come to you,
or it's like marlin fishing.

50
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:12,710
- What?
- Marlin fishing, man.

51
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,599
A woman's like a big game fish.

52
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:22,871
lf you really want her, you need
a boat, bait, get out on the sea ...

53
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:28,353
And if you get a hook-up, you
have to drag it back to the boat.

54
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:33,150
l have a question for you.
At that point, who's tired?

55
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:36,596
- You?
- No, the both of you!

56
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:43,199
You know l say to them? ''You may be
a symphony, but l believe in song.''

57
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,279
- l don't get it. Do you get it?
- Sometimes.

58
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,872
Are you going to be all right?

59
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:13,316
Yeah, l'm fine.

60
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:27,314
Hey, English!
Come here.

61
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:32,838
No TV, you understand me?
No shopping malls.

62
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:39,473
No tour buses.
You hear me, English? No fast food.

63
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:43,110
Leave us alone!

64
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:46,398
Are they going to execute us?
l wasn't even doing anything.

65
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:53,191
Oh, man!
l'm going to have a heart attack.

66
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,920
Chin up!
The tide raises all ships.

67
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:00,198
Five more hours,
and we would have been out of here.

68
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:04,911
- We've got until ten.
- We'll never make that plane.

69
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:10,473
- The harbour's only a mile away.
- We're in jail, Mickey!

70
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:14,394
This ain't about being caged.

71
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,917
l've seen birds in cages,
and you ain't no bird.

72
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:26,589
Did you know that birds are
the direct descendants of dinosaurs?

73
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:32,278
You know what ''dinosaur'' means?
lt's Greek for ''terrible lizard''.

74
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,954
Think about that.

75
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:43,914
- That's my board! What do we do?
- Run like hell.

76
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:00,836
Come back here, you idiots.

77
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,754
l sense angels at work here.

78
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,714
There's that taxi again.

79
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:31,199
- Look out!
- He nearly killed me.

80
00:13:54,880 --> 00:14:00,193
That's the most beautiful thing
l've ever seen. lt's an epiphany.

81
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:04,751
Not now, Mickey.
Can't you see we're in trouble?

82
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:18,791
No TV, no diet Cola, no shopping
malls. You hear me, cue ball?

83
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:29,271
l said, leave our women alone.

84
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,591
Come on,
this thing's going to take off.

85
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:54,715
Every sport has its own mythology.
lts legends.

86
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:01,788
Joe Louis, Muhammad Ali,
Mickey Mantle, Michael Jordan ...

87
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:07,717
Faces you see on television.
Surfing has a mythology, too.

88
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:12,635
Most of it is based on
what you never see.

89
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:20,478
Stories of rides on unimaginable
waves in obscure far-away places, -

90
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:25,395
- and of the people
who seek these moments out, -

91
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:29,439
- travelling like spirits
from country to country.

92
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:07,272
As for him ... Before enlightenment,
chop wood and carry water.

93
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:12,309
After enlightenment,
chop wood and carry water.

94
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:16,109
He's good to know
when your back's against the wall.

95
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:20,356
l like you, Mickey.
You're a good lad.

96
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:24,115
Thank you, Captain.
That's a nice thing to say.

97
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,076
Straight flush ...

98
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:32,438
l hope this doesn't
screw things up between us.

99
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:39,918
- Hey, Keoni! Happy birthday.
- Thanks.

100
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,390
lt's a good life.

101
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,912
This isn't just a skateboard ramp.

102
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,789
We build temples to adrenalin.

103
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:25,796
lt's like Chinese architecture. They
didn't build for the human body, -

104
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:28,554
- but for the human spirit.

105
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:05,990
You know where waves come from?

106
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:11,678
lmagine you're a giant
standing in the Bay of Alaska.

107
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:17,836
You drop a boulder in the water,
and the rings fan out.

108
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:22,713
They keep going
until something gets in their way.

109
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:28,398
An island, a continent, a reef ...

110
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:36,672
Something that forces them to peak,
then break, then roll.

111
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,396
Does that make sense to you?

112
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:50,476
Probably not. lf you understood,
l probably wouldn't be saying it.

113
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:58,596
Say a big swell hits Hawaii, and
you ride one of those huge waves.

114
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:03,311
The wave folds back together
on the other side of the island.

115
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:10,431
Then back out across the ocean,
to wherever it needs to go.

116
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,156
All you would need to do
to ride it again, -

117
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:22,395
- is find out where it's heading,
and beat it there, however you can.

118
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:29,791
That's what l've been doing.
l'm trying to figure it out.

119
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:35,637
Why, when the wave's just right,
when it's big and hollow enough, -

120
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,712
- and l'm inside of it, -

121
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:45,513
- everything, whatever l'm doing,
why l'm doing it ...

122
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:49,593
ln that moment, it all makes sense.

123
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:55,829
Most everybody
wants something else from it.

124
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:01,279
l'm afraid if l ask for more,
it'll all disappear.

125
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:28,276
Be careful. l know you're
the captain's daughter, -

126
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:32,877
- but we just got into trouble
because of a woman.

127
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:38,910
- You're very young.
- Yeah. l <i>am</i> young.

128
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,992
- Where's your home?
- Wherever the surf's good.

129
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:52,392
You know Mickey?
He was number two in the world.

130
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:58,510
Pro tour and everything.
Could have been number one, but ...

131
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:03,037
See him? He's the best in the world.
That's what Mickey says.

132
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:08,194
That's what <i>everybody</i> says.
But he won't compete on the tour.

133
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:11,796
l guess he doesn't like hotel rooms.

134
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:15,873
But he's a hot surfer.
That's all that matters.

135
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:20,238
When l'm old enough,
l'll go on that tour and cash in.

136
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,313
l'll buy my mom a house
and get her teeth fixed.

137
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:28,598
Everybody's got to have
beautiful teeth. Even Mom.

138
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:34,554
Salt water
is closely related to blood.

139
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:38,076
lt reminds me of our own essence.

140
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,358
She wants to go with you.

141
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:48,674
When my wife was alive,
we found her on the streets of Rio.

142
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:52,879
l brought her on board
to save her life.

143
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,793
She recognises herself in you.

144
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,316
The same eyes, the same heart.

145
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:04,632
Without lies,
taking only what you need, -

146
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:07,837
- giving only what you can.

147
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,754
She feels safe with you, -

148
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:16,630
- although she knows
she won't stay with you forever.

149
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:09,514
Kick his ass!

150
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:22,109
- Take this, Mickey.
- l have him right where l want him.

151
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:24,714
Kick his ass.

152
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:44,031
- How much did we bet?
- lf we lose, we don't eat.

153
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:48,793
l'm gonna kick your butt!

154
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:54,195
A little hot sauce
will fix this guy.

155
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,999
You enjoying your visit to Bali?

156
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:13,233
Jet lag's got me down,
but l'll get used to it.

157
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:16,078
As soon as we can,
we're going to move the car.

158
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:24,074
lf l understood what you're saying,
it would help.

159
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,152
Hey, nice to see you, man.

160
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:29,629
Tell him, nice to see him.

161
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:33,793
No problem.
These guys are friends of mine.

162
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:39,718
Guys, how's it, man?
How are you doing? Good to see you.

163
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:49,031
Good to see you, man.
lt's been a long time.

164
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:57,838
l've got to get back in shape.
lt's been a long summer.

165
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,231
- l believe these belong to you?
- Keep them.

166
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:05,029
You never know
when you might need them.

167
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,954
- Who are you?
- Just a fan.

168
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:12,112
l was hoping
l could train with you guys.

169
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:17,798
<i>Very few surfers have the courage</i>
<i>and skill to ride really big waves.</i>

170
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:23,273
<i>And here, in a marketplace in Bali,</i>
<i>on the other side of the world,</i> -

171
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,477
- <i>he was about to become</i>
<i>one of them.</i>

172
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:31,236
<i>Some mornings I wake up</i>
<i>and ask myself,</i> -

173
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:36,076
- <i>"Will I die today?"</i>
<i>You never know when you'll go.</i>

174
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:41,030
<i>If something goes wrong,</i>
<i>the jet ski is your only salvation.</i>

175
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:44,636
Jet skis, ropes!
You've got equipment on the brain.

176
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:49,430
ln Hawaii, l'll paddle into those
40-footers with my bare hands.

177
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,319
You can't paddle. lt's too big.

178
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:56,473
- lt's just a wave, man.
- lt's too fast.

179
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:02,431
- You can't paddle 35 mph.
- Horse shit! lt's just a wave, man.

180
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:06,912
You've got to be in the right place
at the right time.

181
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:10,311
- Dream on.
- Are you towing me in?

182
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:15,315
You, no problem.
As for him ... no way.

183
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:20,110
- And just why the hell not?
- Because you're crazy.

184
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:23,272
Thank you, Keoni.
l love you, too.

185
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:27,638
But l will tell you one thing.
For us, the partying's over.

186
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:33,955
Starting tomorrow, we train.
All day, every day. <i>That's</i> reality.

187
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:28,436
<i>There are two types of surfers to</i>
<i>watch when surfing dangerous waves.</i>

188
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:32,798
One is gung ho.
He doesn't consider the risks.

189
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:37,795
The other is gun shy.
He doesn't want to accept the risks.

190
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:42,238
ln this ''cage'' here,
one focusses on his abilities, -

191
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:45,312
- and the other, on his limitations.

192
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:49,712
Pete, what is the worst-case
scenario you can think of?

193
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:54,556
The worst thing l can see is
if someone goes down, -

194
00:32:54,720 --> 00:33:00,955
- and gets held under,
and the rescue team can't find him.

195
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:05,790
Rush,
what is the worst-case scenario?

196
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:11,557
lf you let go of the rope too soon,
and you lose speed -

197
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:15,679
- and the wave comes from behind
and gobbles you up.

198
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,354
Shane?

199
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:25,116
l think the worst thing would be
to get sucked over the falls -

200
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:32,311
- and lose all your air on impact,
and get sucked down. 30 or 40 feet.

201
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:38,510
And it's getting darker and darker,
and all the clouds surrounding you.

202
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:43,754
Like you're just about to black out,
and it's really loud and dark ...

203
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:47,708
l think that'd be
a really bad scenario.

204
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:02,033
- How long have you lived here?
- Forever. l came for the surf.

205
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:07,797
l couldn't see leaving.
l travel, but l always come back.

206
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:11,236
- Are you a writer?
- Yeah.

207
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:14,392
Got a wife?

208
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:17,950
- Kids?
- Yeah, three. Girls.

209
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:21,908
- They surf.
- Of course.

210
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:32,396
The Navy's got
things called ''rebreathers''.

211
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:36,155
lt fits in your mouth
and pulls oxygen from the water.

212
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:41,030
lt won't be long
till we stay down indefinitely.

213
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:44,954
Rebreathers, my ass!
You sound like astronauts.

214
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:48,715
You guys don't tow me in,
l'm gonna paddle in.

215
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:54,034
You don't think l can?
l was number two in the world.

216
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:58,159
- That was eight years ago.
- Eight long years, bro.

217
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:01,357
Eight years! Eight years!

218
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:04,512
Eight years, my ass!

219
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:12,199
Eight years, eight years,
eight years ...

220
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:28,878
You understand, we can augment
our abilities through technology, -

221
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:35,195
- but technology isn't everything.
You need speed and strength.

222
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:41,515
You must be quick and agile to fly,
and flexible, to reduce injury.

223
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:59,430
With big waves, you can be
held under for more than one wave.

224
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:02,717
You could be held under
for two waves.

225
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:06,873
You could even be held under
for three waves.

226
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:11,828
We understand the risks
in what we're up against.

227
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,437
We know exactly
what our bodies are able to do.

228
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:32,592
We practise extreme safety
when we're doing extreme things.

229
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:40,434
<i>Technology brings surfing</i>
<i>to another dimension,</i> -

230
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:46,550
- <i>allowing a rider to match the</i>
<i>speed of a 50-foot wave at 35 mph.</i>

231
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:50,269
<i>But the question is,</i>
<i>at what price?</i>

232
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:54,035
<i>When only the most skilled</i>
<i>can survive,</i> -

233
00:37:54,200 --> 00:38:00,435
- <i>to ride waves this big</i>
<i>is to put yourself in God's hands.</i>

234
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:48,753
- What's the matter? Side pain?
- l can't breathe.

235
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:54,313
- What's up?
- Take a deep breath. Breathe.

236
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:57,438
Relax, relax ...

237
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:00,637
Okay, let's walk him home.

238
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:31,032
He's burning up.

239
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:40,391
- Maybe malaria ...
- l'll be fine.

240
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:47,755
No matter what, no hospitals, okay?
Because l hate doctors.

241
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:52,599
One time my mom had
a skin disease ...

242
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:59,518
lt got really infected
and we had to take her to hospital.

243
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:03,468
A stupid doctor gave her
all the wrong things.

244
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:09,794
Ruined her teeth,
ruined her hair ...

245
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:13,509
He made her look old.

246
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:21,838
My dad freaked. He drove his truck
right through the doc's living room.

247
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:27,514
Right through the picture window.

248
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:34,595
You'll be okay.
You're strong.

249
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:40,839
The strongest man on earth.

250
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:06,797
- What is this place?
- My home.

251
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:13,115
There's a rock concert once a year.
We get invaded for three days.

252
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:30,512
Daddy, Daddy!

253
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:36,919
Hi, girls.
l've missed you so much.

254
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:44,637
Hi ... Look how big you are!
Oh God, l missed you.

255
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:50,633
Wyatt!

256
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:19,708
l'm not gonna die or anything, man!
l've just got a temperature.

257
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:23,913
Help me get him to my house.

258
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:31,194
Serena's with him.
l hope it's not malaria.

259
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:52,916
<i>Welcome, travellers.</i>
<i>Time to rock.</i>

260
00:42:53,080 --> 00:43:00,031
<i>Remember you're guests in another</i>
<i>people's land, so listen up!</i>

261
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:05,354
<i>There's trash cans and</i>
<i>port-a-potties galore. Use them.</i>

262
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:12,392
<i>If you choose to partake,</i>
<i>then for heaven's sake be discreet.</i>

263
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:05,639
This is for you,
and this is for you.

264
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:26,435
- Why aren't you with your friends?
- Too many people.

265
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:31,993
l know what you mean. Come on,
l want to show you something.

266
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:45,079
All over the world, people
are returning to their tribes.

267
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:51,108
You may not realise it, but
you and your friends are a tribe.

268
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:56,434
lt's a tribe built on mutual respect
and a common understanding -

269
00:44:56,600 --> 00:45:00,479
- of what it takes to do what we do.

270
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:05,634
- l never really saw it that way.
- What about riding the big waves?

271
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:10,032
- Are you frightened of them?
- Yeah.

272
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:13,875
What about using a jet ski
to help you get in?

273
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:17,555
That's one way ...

274
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:23,238
Mickey thinks you can paddle
into them. He hates jet skis.

275
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:27,996
- He says it takes the purity away.
- What do you think?

276
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:32,917
l haven't really
made my mind up yet.

277
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:01,399
lt's morning.
The night is over.

278
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:09,871
Hey, you okay?
Rough night, huh?

279
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:16,274
The guys are training.
l've got to get out there.

280
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:20,069
They'll take care of you.
Need anything?

281
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:35,233
- Come on, Mickey, focus!
- l got it.

282
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:57,076
Wait for the wind. Perfect!

283
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:13,514
Faster, faster!

284
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:33,829
This is <i>wrong</i>.

285
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:42,717
l got it, l got it.

286
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:50,589
<i>As I watched them train today,</i>
<i>I was filled with sadness.</i>

287
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:55,595
<i>So many people aspire to greatness,</i>
<i>so few succeed.</i>

288
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:59,355
<i>I could see the separation</i>
<i>happening before my eyes.</i>

289
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:02,398
<i>Hawaii's big waves await them.</i>

290
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:07,634
<i>A challenge to one,</i>
<i>a threat to the other.</i>
