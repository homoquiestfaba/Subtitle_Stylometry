1
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:50,459
- Oh, this is great!
- Wow!

2
00:02:50,637 --> 00:02:55,370
Oh, that's incredible. There's
got to be seven or eight feet up there.

3
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:59,410
- And eighty years of dust.
- Oh, look at all this height.

4
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:02,412
We could put our bedroom upstairs,
and get all this space.

5
00:03:02,582 --> 00:03:05,642
- For what?
- Just space.

6
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:08,286
One!

7
00:03:08,454 --> 00:03:10,046
Two!

8
00:03:10,223 --> 00:03:12,817
Three!

9
00:03:12,992 --> 00:03:15,790
- And four?
- Come on.

10
00:03:16,796 --> 00:03:18,559
And five?

11
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:25,132
- Watch, watch!
- God, this place is huge.

12
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:30,137
- lt's beautiful.
- God!

13
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:34,747
- You guys, it's absolutely incredible.
- lncredible.

14
00:03:34,914 --> 00:03:38,714
- A little paint.
- Sell it tomorrow, double your money.

15
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:41,376
Carl, you're obsessed.

16
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:42,987
A little bit.

17
00:03:43,156 --> 00:03:44,783
Wow, look!

18
00:03:46,926 --> 00:03:48,917
Hey, it's an lndian Head penny.

19
00:03:49,095 --> 00:03:50,619
1 898.

20
00:03:53,499 --> 00:03:56,059
lt's a good omen.

21
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,227
You're the good omen.

22
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:04,009
Oh, it's so great!

23
00:04:13,553 --> 00:04:17,455
l had Rose move your 3 o'clock
with Bob Kahan to 4 o'clock.

24
00:04:17,624 --> 00:04:22,721
Gary Alan called. He has to see you
about the painting bids for the loft.

25
00:04:22,895 --> 00:04:26,194
3 o'clock is the only time
he can make it. ls that OK?

26
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:27,958
Sam?

27
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:32,931
- l'm sorry.
- Relax, man.

28
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:35,370
You're not having brain surgery.

29
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:39,136
Pitching these Japanese guys
makes me so nervous.

30
00:04:39,312 --> 00:04:43,544
Sam, you're going to be great. OK?

31
00:04:43,716 --> 00:04:49,586
What am l supposed to say? l can't
really tell them my Swedish girl joke.

32
00:04:49,756 --> 00:04:51,815
Great. Where did you get those?

33
00:04:51,991 --> 00:04:55,324
Molly. What do you think?
Are they me?

34
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:58,464
- Oh, man. Look at that, a Testarossa.
- Wow...

35
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:01,293
- Ouch!
- Pay off your Mustang first.

36
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:14,275
How are you?
What did the doctor say?

37
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:17,507
He said that it was contagious.
That it was really...

38
00:05:17,684 --> 00:05:19,242
- No?
- Yeah.

39
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:22,013
l shouldn't even be coming in today.

40
00:05:23,022 --> 00:05:25,957
What about the rash?

41
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:27,251
The rash?

42
00:05:27,427 --> 00:05:30,760
The rash is also incredibly contagious.

43
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:34,161
- He said they've both been spreading.
- No?

44
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:39,831
On your genitals again?

45
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:43,533
Yeah, yeah, right on the genitals.

46
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:48,306
Basically everywhere.
He said that l shouldn't touch anyone.

47
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:50,278
Excuse me, l'm sorry.

48
00:05:53,886 --> 00:05:55,478
- You're sick!
- l know.

49
00:05:55,655 --> 00:05:57,282
- Morning, Paul.
- Morning, Carl.

50
00:05:57,457 --> 00:05:59,687
Save it, Paul.

51
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:02,157
- Morning, Mr Wheat.
- Susie. You're looking good.

52
00:06:02,328 --> 00:06:05,229
- Sam.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

53
00:06:07,767 --> 00:06:09,997
- Here it is.
- Thanks.

54
00:06:12,071 --> 00:06:13,936
- Morning, Sam.
- Morning, Rose.

55
00:06:14,107 --> 00:06:17,076
- Listen, the Kobiashi people...
- They're already here.

56
00:06:17,243 --> 00:06:19,234
- They're early!
- l know.

57
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:21,744
- Come here!
- Andy Dillon called...

58
00:06:21,914 --> 00:06:23,905
- How long have they been here?
- Ten minutes.

59
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:28,452
Andy Dillon called. He needs $900,000
transferred to Albany by ten.

60
00:06:28,621 --> 00:06:30,521
- By ten?
- Yes.

61
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:35,352
- Carl?
- Yeah.

62
00:06:36,596 --> 00:06:38,530
Carl...

63
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:43,067
Dillon needs 900,000 in Albany by ten.
Can you transfer it to his account?

64
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:46,228
- Yes, but l need your MAC code.
- OK.

65
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:55,339
- Discretion, right?
- Got it.

66
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:58,143
- You bet. l'll do it right now.
- Thanks.

67
00:06:58,317 --> 00:07:00,148
Bill, l'll call you back.

68
00:07:10,997 --> 00:07:12,624
OK, that's fine.

69
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:13,993
That's fine.

70
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:17,599
This is too far out.

71
00:07:19,338 --> 00:07:21,033
Can you get this, man?

72
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:26,503
Are you guys from
the New York City Ballet?

73
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:31,876
Almost...

74
00:07:35,354 --> 00:07:37,788
- Saved your life!
- You shit.

75
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:40,152
Why do you scare me to death?

76
00:07:40,326 --> 00:07:44,524
lt's better than seeing this gorgeous
body splattered all over the place.

77
00:07:44,697 --> 00:07:45,994
Look out!

78
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:54,739
- Grab it!
- Sam, Moll! Are you guys home?

79
00:07:54,907 --> 00:07:56,670
- Did you invite Carl?
- Slave labour.

80
00:07:56,843 --> 00:07:58,811
- Carl!
- Hurry, help!

81
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:01,538
- Oh, my God.
- Grab the bottom.

82
00:08:01,714 --> 00:08:05,275
- Now, go there.
- Here?

83
00:08:05,451 --> 00:08:08,318
- Right here?
- Watch your toes.

84
00:08:09,055 --> 00:08:13,890
- Where do you want this?
- ln the bedroom.

85
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:18,429
- God, this place looks great!
- You like it, huh?

86
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:22,932
Like is hardly the word. l had no idea
it would be this beautiful. lt's incredible.

87
00:08:23,102 --> 00:08:27,334
- What about her?
- Leave her until the other stuff is here.

88
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:30,499
- What are these?
- Oh, let me show you.

89
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:33,577
Will you help me lift this up?

90
00:08:36,082 --> 00:08:40,815
- Just finished it. What do you think?
- l love it.

91
00:08:40,987 --> 00:08:44,320
Sam, what's this chair doing here?

92
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:47,823
- l love that chair.
- l know, but we discussed this.

93
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:50,258
l've had it forever.

94
00:08:50,429 --> 00:08:54,559
- When l watch TV, l sit in it.
- This chair is ugly.

95
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:58,795
- And it doesn't go with anything.
- lt goes with me.

96
00:08:58,971 --> 00:09:01,940
You're right, it does.

97
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:04,941
- We'll paint it.
- We'll what?

98
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,452
Are you OK?

99
00:09:16,622 --> 00:09:18,556
l'm fine.

100
00:09:21,427 --> 00:09:23,987
What's the matter?

101
00:09:24,163 --> 00:09:25,994
Nothing.

102
00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:33,602
Are you worried about the promotion?

103
00:09:33,773 --> 00:09:35,741
No, not really.

104
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:47,651
Then what - moving in together?

105
00:09:48,487 --> 00:09:50,648
No.

106
00:09:53,826 --> 00:09:57,125
l don't know. lt's a lot of things.

107
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:04,098
l just don't want the bubble to burst.

108
00:10:06,505 --> 00:10:08,564
lt seems like...

109
00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:16,079
..whenever anything good in my life
happens, l'm afraid l'm going to lose it.

110
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:23,317
l love you.

111
00:10:23,489 --> 00:10:26,253
l really love you.

112
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,852
Ditto.

113
00:10:32,865 --> 00:10:39,668
The pilot´s first report of trouble was
he blew the number two engine...

114
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,967
Oh, Jesus. Another one?

115
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:47,604
Don't watch that.

116
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:53,047
l should cancel my LA trip.
These things always happen in threes.

117
00:10:53,219 --> 00:10:55,312
Sam, get serious!

118
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:59,788
- Besides, you lead a charmed life.
- Yeah, so did they.

119
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:04,423
lt's amazing. Just like that...

120
00:11:04,597 --> 00:11:06,497
Blackout.

121
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:16,395
What are you doing?

122
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:18,594
l couldn't sleep.

123
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:22,874
Boy...

124
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:25,237
l really must have passed out.

125
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:29,211
- What time is it?
- lt's 2 am.

126
00:12:53,072 --> 00:12:54,300
Oh, no!

127
00:12:54,473 --> 00:12:57,237
l hope it wasn't a masterpiece.

128
00:12:57,409 --> 00:12:59,707
Well, it's not now.

129
00:13:01,347 --> 00:13:03,440
- Can l help?
- Yeah.

130
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:06,517
Put your hands here...
Now get them wet.

131
00:13:09,054 --> 00:13:12,319
Let the clay slide between your fingers.

132
00:16:05,864 --> 00:16:08,856
Oh, no.

133
00:16:09,034 --> 00:16:13,164
- What's the matter?
- A glitch. What's up?

134
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:17,036
The Greenberg and White accounts,
l can't get in. The code doesn't work.

135
00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:19,541
- l changed it.
- Why?

136
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:25,446
- l just want to nose around a bit.
- ls something wrong?

137
00:16:25,617 --> 00:16:26,879
Can you keep a secret?

138
00:16:28,954 --> 00:16:31,923
Yeah, sure. What's up?

139
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:34,286
There's too much money
in these accounts.

140
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:37,224
That's impossible.

141
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:45,998
Sam, this is going to take you hours.
Let me do this.

142
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:50,198
- lt already has taken me hours.
- Let me figure it out for you.

143
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:52,936
No, it's OK. lt's like a vendetta now.

144
00:16:53,979 --> 00:16:56,812
Thanks, though, l appreciate it.

145
00:16:56,982 --> 00:17:00,816
- lf you start to go blind, give a shout.
- OK. Adiós.

146
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:05,119
Listen, what are you and Moll
doing tonight?

147
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:08,384
We're going to the theatre.
She wants to see Macbeth.

148
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:11,051
l think she likes the guys in tights.

149
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:14,631
- You want to go?
- No. l want a full report, though.

150
00:17:15,234 --> 00:17:17,099
- Later.
- Yeah.

151
00:17:22,674 --> 00:17:26,371
Well, l loved it.
l was spellbound the whole time.

152
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:32,211
l could tell, and so could the rest of
the audience, with that snore of yours.

153
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:41,453
- Did l tell you what Marcia said?
- About six times.

154
00:17:41,627 --> 00:17:45,723
lt wasn't six times.
Quit being so blasé about this.

155
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:49,425
This was really important. l'm going
to have two pieces in her gallery.

156
00:17:49,601 --> 00:17:53,230
The New York Times
reviews her gallery all the time.

157
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:57,501
The New York Times is a frustrated
critic with pimples on his ass

158
00:17:57,676 --> 00:18:01,442
who flunked art school.
Who cares what they think?

159
00:18:01,613 --> 00:18:04,275
About 8 million readers, that's who.

160
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:08,147
No, they're just reading
the sports page.

161
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:12,484
Your work is really beautiful.
lt really is.

162
00:18:12,658 --> 00:18:17,152
lt shouldn't matter what anyone else
thinks, just what l think.

163
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:24,936
- l want to marry you, Sam.
- What?

164
00:18:27,139 --> 00:18:32,042
- What?
- Yeah, l've been thinking about it.

165
00:18:32,211 --> 00:18:34,907
l've been thinking about it a lot.

166
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,605
l think we should just do it.

167
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:41,812
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

168
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:47,687
What's that look for?

169
00:18:51,196 --> 00:18:54,393
You never wanted to talk about it.

170
00:19:03,942 --> 00:19:10,142
- Do you love me, Sam?
- What do you think?

171
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:13,409
- Why don't you ever say it?
- What do you mean?

172
00:19:13,585 --> 00:19:18,716
- l say it all the time.
- You say ''ditto.'' That's not the same.

173
00:19:21,093 --> 00:19:25,757
People say ''l love you'' all the time,
and it doesn't mean anything.

174
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:32,334
Sometimes you need to hear it.

175
00:19:33,138 --> 00:19:36,039
l need to hear it.

176
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:38,005
Let's go!

177
00:19:46,418 --> 00:19:49,012
- What should we do?
- Let me handle it.

178
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,281
- What do you want?
- Your wallet!

179
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:55,425
Sam, just give it to him.

180
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:59,956
Just take the money. Just leave...

181
00:20:00,132 --> 00:20:01,759
No! Sam!

182
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:04,061
You son of a bitch!

183
00:20:09,007 --> 00:20:10,975
Somebody help us!

184
00:20:15,647 --> 00:20:19,947
Somebody! Somebody help us!

185
00:20:22,454 --> 00:20:25,685
Stop it, Sam!

186
00:20:46,211 --> 00:20:48,076
Molly?

187
00:20:49,848 --> 00:20:51,713
Molly! You got...?

188
00:21:03,562 --> 00:21:08,192
Oh, baby, hold on.
You're going to be OK.

189
00:21:10,168 --> 00:21:13,262
Somebody? Somebody!

190
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:16,874
Somebody help us!

191
00:21:18,644 --> 00:21:23,604
Oh, my God!
Oh, Sam, come on. Come on, baby.

192
00:21:24,683 --> 00:21:29,552
You're going to be OK.

193
00:21:38,597 --> 00:21:43,034
Somebody? Somebody help me!

194
00:21:43,201 --> 00:21:47,570
Please, anybody!

195
00:21:47,739 --> 00:21:52,267
OK, lady, take it easy.
We'll help you.

196
00:21:52,444 --> 00:21:54,969
Molly? Molly?

197
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:57,342
Molly!

198
00:22:01,219 --> 00:22:04,780
What shall we do?

199
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,636
What's happening? What's...

200
00:22:18,804 --> 00:22:20,135
ls he breathing?

201
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:30,345
Oh, goddamn, hold on.

202
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:56,364
Here we go.

203
00:23:00,612 --> 00:23:04,548
Sam, don't you leave me! Hold on!

204
00:23:57,369 --> 00:24:00,497
lf you would just step this way.

205
00:24:17,556 --> 00:24:22,289
- So, what happened to you?
- What?

206
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:24,190
You're new, huh? l can tell.

207
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:28,365
- Are you talking to me?
- Relax, it ain't like before.

208
00:24:28,533 --> 00:24:30,899
lt's a whole new ball of wax.

209
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:33,901
- Who are you?
- l'm waiting for my wife.

210
00:24:34,072 --> 00:24:38,168
She's in the cardiac wing.
She's fighting it.

211
00:24:47,085 --> 00:24:49,918
Shot? That'll do it every time.

212
00:24:51,389 --> 00:24:52,913
Poor bastard.

213
00:24:53,091 --> 00:24:57,721
You may as well get used to it -
you could be here for a long while.

214
00:25:02,133 --> 00:25:06,365
l'll tell you a secret.
Doors ain't as bad as you think.

215
00:25:06,538 --> 00:25:10,599
Zip-zap - ain't nothing at all.
You'll see. You'll catch on.

216
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:20,718
He ain't going to make it. l've seen it
a million times - he's a goner.

217
00:25:25,624 --> 00:25:28,593
You see? Here they come.

218
00:25:32,631 --> 00:25:36,965
Lucky bastard!
lt could have been the other ones.

219
00:25:37,135 --> 00:25:39,296
You never know.

220
00:25:59,658 --> 00:26:01,558
Who are they?

221
00:26:06,197 --> 00:26:07,994
No!

222
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:18,038
God help me!

223
00:26:19,311 --> 00:26:21,677
Help me!

224
00:26:27,686 --> 00:26:32,817
''l am sunk in the abysmal swamp
where there is no foothold.

225
00:26:32,991 --> 00:26:38,725
''l have reached the watery depths.
The flood overwhelms me.

226
00:26:38,897 --> 00:26:42,094
''l am wearied with calling.''

227
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:46,533
As we say farewell to our friend,
Sam Wheat,

228
00:26:46,705 --> 00:26:49,674
we are reminded of his kindness,

229
00:26:49,841 --> 00:26:52,207
his generosity,

230
00:26:52,377 --> 00:26:55,608
his buoyancy of spirit.

231
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,771
All that we treasure,

232
00:26:57,949 --> 00:27:03,353
our loved ones,
our friends, our body...

233
00:27:03,521 --> 00:27:05,785
..our mind,

234
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:11,486
are but on loan to us.
We must surrender them all.

235
00:27:11,663 --> 00:27:17,101
We are all travellers on the same road,
which leads to the same end.

236
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:24,099
As our loved one enters eternal life,

237
00:27:24,275 --> 00:27:27,642
let us remember
that love, too, is eternal.

238
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:33,283
That although we will miss him,
our love will light the void

239
00:27:33,451 --> 00:27:36,011
and dispel the darkness.

240
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:17,756
l picked up your shirts today.

241
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:22,663
l don't know why.

242
00:28:25,403 --> 00:28:28,600
Mr Reynolds told me to tell you ''hello.''

243
00:28:31,676 --> 00:28:34,008
l broke into tears.

244
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:39,980
lt's like l think about you every minute.

245
00:28:40,151 --> 00:28:42,847
lt's like l can still feel you.

246
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:54,695
l'm here, Moll.

247
00:29:03,341 --> 00:29:05,639
What's the matter, kitty?

248
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:08,438
What's the matter?

249
00:29:08,613 --> 00:29:10,843
Crazy cat.

250
00:29:14,452 --> 00:29:16,181
Sam?

251
00:29:18,356 --> 00:29:20,620
lt's really stupid.

252
00:29:32,036 --> 00:29:34,095
l love this picture.

253
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:37,207
lt's great. Office.

254
00:29:46,417 --> 00:29:48,977
Let me see that!

255
00:29:49,154 --> 00:29:51,622
Sam's address book.

256
00:29:57,896 --> 00:30:01,889
- Dave Brubeck, should l toss them?
- No.

257
00:30:02,066 --> 00:30:04,830
No? Molly, we hated that concert.

258
00:30:07,539 --> 00:30:09,905
You wanted to save those?

259
00:30:10,074 --> 00:30:13,976
Rolaids? Molly, what are you doing?

260
00:30:22,053 --> 00:30:25,545
l just miss him, Carl.

261
00:30:25,723 --> 00:30:27,554
Me, too.

262
00:30:30,128 --> 00:30:34,064
Carl? Wait a minute.

263
00:30:34,232 --> 00:30:36,757
Not that one.

264
00:30:36,935 --> 00:30:40,837
l'm sorry.
l didn't mean to put that on there.

265
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:44,202
Hey, Moll. Why don't you come?

266
00:30:44,375 --> 00:30:48,675
- lt's like summer outside.
- No. l'm really not up for it.

267
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:52,681
- lt would be good for you to get out.
- l don't want to.

268
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:55,479
You can't stay in here all day.
lt's not healthy.

269
00:30:55,653 --> 00:30:57,746
l can't do it!

270
00:30:58,423 --> 00:31:00,914
You're not the one who died.

271
00:31:04,662 --> 00:31:07,563
- l'm sorry.
- Don't apologise.

272
00:31:07,732 --> 00:31:09,700
Shit!

273
00:31:13,104 --> 00:31:18,041
- Maybe you're right. Just a short one.
- That a girl!

274
00:31:21,579 --> 00:31:23,137
l'm sorry.

275
00:31:23,314 --> 00:31:25,179
Molly?

276
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:28,670
What are you doing here?

277
00:32:28,846 --> 00:32:30,473
You bastard!

278
00:32:32,884 --> 00:32:35,148
You son of a bitch!

279
00:32:51,602 --> 00:32:53,968
What do you want?

280
00:32:54,906 --> 00:32:56,771
Molly?

281
00:32:57,608 --> 00:32:59,599
Molly, get out!

282
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:07,884
No, Molly!

283
00:33:08,052 --> 00:33:10,077
No, please?

284
00:33:11,789 --> 00:33:14,121
He's got a gun, Molly!

285
00:33:14,292 --> 00:33:16,351
Hi, kitty.

286
00:33:17,595 --> 00:33:19,392
You hurt her, l'll...

287
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:47,653
Shit!

289
00:33:54,999 --> 00:33:56,899
Hello?

290
00:35:14,378 --> 00:35:16,972
Let go! What are you doing?

291
00:35:21,385 --> 00:35:23,410
Like trains?

292
00:35:34,365 --> 00:35:36,094
Stay out! This is mine.

293
00:36:53,911 --> 00:36:55,708
Shit!

294
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:08,988
lt's me. l couldn't get it.

295
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:11,458
She came home.

296
00:37:11,629 --> 00:37:14,325
Give me a couple of days. l'll go back.

297
00:37:15,266 --> 00:37:17,894
Relax. l'll get it.

298
00:37:19,537 --> 00:37:21,630
Get what?

299
00:37:23,608 --> 00:37:28,545
Who are you?
What do you want from us?

300
00:37:32,216 --> 00:37:36,175
No. You stay away from her!

301
00:37:37,655 --> 00:37:39,418
Do you hear me?

302
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:41,820
You stay away from her!

303
00:38:44,088 --> 00:38:46,386
Rosa Santiago?

304
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:54,127
Please be seated.

305
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,573
Our sister will be with us soon.

306
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:16,813
Sister Oda Mae,

307
00:39:16,987 --> 00:39:21,014

of your all-seeing presence.

308
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:23,956

309
00:39:29,333 --> 00:39:30,857
Mrs Santiago?

310
00:39:32,103 --> 00:39:35,368
- Buenos días.
- l'm Oda Mae Brown.

311
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:40,374
You wish to contact your husband.
l believe he'll be with us today.

312
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:42,637
Thank you.

313
00:39:43,681 --> 00:39:46,514
But you know, Mrs Santiago,

314
00:39:46,684 --> 00:39:49,585
there's no telling
about that other world,

315
00:39:49,754 --> 00:39:53,451
so you've got to be a believer.
Are you a believer?

316
00:39:53,624 --> 00:39:57,253
Sí, l believe, l believe.

317
00:39:57,428 --> 00:39:59,589
Then let us begin.

318
00:40:20,651 --> 00:40:23,142
l can't.

319
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,810
lt's too difficult.

320
00:40:24,989 --> 00:40:29,426
l just can't seem to make contact.
No - wait!

321
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:32,619
l'm feeling something.

322
00:40:32,797 --> 00:40:38,394
Did he know someone
by the name of Anna?

323
00:40:38,569 --> 00:40:40,036
Consuelo?

324
00:40:41,071 --> 00:40:43,665
Lucita? Julietta?

325
00:40:43,841 --> 00:40:46,241
Josephina? Linda? Maria?

326
00:40:46,977 --> 00:40:50,674
Sí, sí! His Mama, she is Maria.

327
00:40:50,848 --> 00:40:54,944
Yes! Praise God.
l knew he was with his Mama.

328
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:56,848
Oh, my God...

329
00:41:02,893 --> 00:41:07,353
lt's too difficult. lt's two of them -
l'm not sure l can do that.

330
00:41:07,531 --> 00:41:10,796
l pay more! How much?

331
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:12,799
- How much?
- Twenty dollars.

332
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:16,201
Way to go. Milk her for every penny.

333
00:41:33,023 --> 00:41:36,584
Yes. l believe we can start again.

334
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:55,069
Praise the Lord! Thank you, Jesus.

335
00:42:11,262 --> 00:42:16,427
Welcome, Mrs Santiago. You are
fortunate, the spirits are churning.

336
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,932
- My husband?
- Mercy!

337
00:42:19,103 --> 00:42:20,593
Oh, yeah, where?

338
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:27,102
- Julio?
- Yes.

339
00:42:27,278 --> 00:42:29,906
l feel his vibration.

340
00:42:33,017 --> 00:42:36,783
- l see him.
- How is he? How does he look?

341
00:42:36,954 --> 00:42:38,546
He's a handsome man.

342
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:42,719
Handsome?

343
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:46,852
Mrs Santiago, in our Father's
Kingdom, we're all handsome.

344
00:42:47,031 --> 00:42:49,556
Oh, Julio.

345
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:54,033
Julio is coming towards us.
l see him! He's coming.

346
00:42:54,872 --> 00:42:56,806
He's there.

347
00:42:59,476 --> 00:43:01,501
He's dressed in a black suit.

348
00:43:03,447 --> 00:43:06,382
Black suit?

349
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:10,509
- Could be blue.
- What a crock of shit.

350
00:43:10,688 --> 00:43:12,883
Who is that?

351
00:43:13,057 --> 00:43:15,025
Where are you?

352
00:43:15,192 --> 00:43:17,524
Did you hear it?

353
00:43:17,695 --> 00:43:19,629
Where are you?

354
00:43:19,797 --> 00:43:21,856
- Who are you?
- Who?

355
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:26,426
- You can hear me?
- Can't you hear him?

356
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:31,098
l don't believe this. My name
is Sam Wheat. Can you hear me?

357
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:35,905
- Say my name, ''Sam Wheat.''
- Leave me alone!

358
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:39,972
- Talk to me, Oda Mae.
- Sam Wheat.

359
00:43:42,886 --> 00:43:45,878
- Jesus... !
- Sam Wheat?

360
00:43:46,056 --> 00:43:51,016
l swear, no more cheating. l'll do
anything, just make that guy go away.

361
00:43:51,195 --> 00:43:52,753
No way.

362
00:44:00,871 --> 00:44:02,634
lt's OK.

363
00:44:06,944 --> 00:44:11,972
- All right, sister?
- Yeah, you're all right.

364
00:44:12,149 --> 00:44:16,017
My mother had it, and her mother.
They both had the gift.

365
00:44:16,186 --> 00:44:20,987
They always said l had it,
but l never did, l never had it.

366
00:44:21,158 --> 00:44:26,186
They told me all about it, but now that
l've got it, l don't think l want it.

367
00:44:26,363 --> 00:44:28,957
Just go away. Find somebody else.

368
00:44:29,133 --> 00:44:32,227
- You're out of your mind.
- l'm getting there fast.

369
00:44:32,403 --> 00:44:34,132
She hit her head hard.

370
00:44:34,304 --> 00:44:37,034
She was talking to somebody
before that.

371
00:44:37,207 --> 00:44:39,471
Sister can do that.

372
00:44:39,643 --> 00:44:43,477
- Where exactly are you?
- Standing right beside you.

373
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:47,674
- You're standing right beside me?
- Honey, we're right here!

374
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:50,251
- Are you white?
- What?

375
00:44:50,421 --> 00:44:53,185
- White?
- You're white, aren't you?

376
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:56,087
- You know what?
- l'm calling the doctor.

377
00:44:56,260 --> 00:45:01,163
- l knew it, a white guy! Why me?
- You're going to help me.

378
00:45:01,331 --> 00:45:06,166
There's a woman who is in terrible
danger. The man who killed me

379
00:45:06,336 --> 00:45:10,602
is going back to our apartment.
You've got to warn her.

380
00:45:10,774 --> 00:45:15,677
- Why would she listen to me?
- lt's just a phone call.

381
00:45:17,581 --> 00:45:19,208
Look...

382
00:45:21,452 --> 00:45:26,822
..you're all l've got. l'm not leaving
until you help me.

383
00:45:26,990 --> 00:45:31,188
l don't care how long it takes,
because l can talk forever.

384
00:45:44,908 --> 00:45:49,140
- Hello.
- Hi, is this Molly Jensen?

385
00:45:49,313 --> 00:45:53,010
My name is Oda Mae Brown,
l'm a spiritual advisor.

386
00:45:53,183 --> 00:45:55,344
l have a message for you.

387
00:45:55,519 --> 00:46:01,549
lt sounds crazy, but it´s not. You´ve
got to believe me, don´t be afraid.

388
00:46:01,725 --> 00:46:04,819
- Who is this?
- l've got a message from Sam.

389
00:46:07,464 --> 00:46:11,264
- What?
- Sam Wheat asked me to call.

390
00:46:13,737 --> 00:46:15,864
- l told you!
- You've got to go there.

391
00:46:16,039 --> 00:46:18,837
l'm not going anywhere.

392
00:46:19,676 --> 00:46:21,974
Second verse, same as the first.

393
00:46:22,146 --> 00:46:27,083
l'm Henry the Eighth, l am
Henry the Eighth l am, l am

394
00:46:27,251 --> 00:46:32,746
l got married to the widow next door,
she's been married seven times before

395
00:46:40,297 --> 00:46:45,360
Henry the Eighth l am, l am
Henry the Eighth l am

396
00:46:45,536 --> 00:46:47,868
Second verse, same as the first

397
00:46:48,038 --> 00:46:52,805
l'm Henry the Eighth, l am
Henry the Eighth l am, l am

398
00:46:52,976 --> 00:46:57,310
- l got married to the widow next door.
- All right! Stop singing.

399
00:46:57,481 --> 00:47:01,884
l'll go anywhere you want to,
just don't sing any more.

400
00:47:08,458 --> 00:47:13,486
l can't believe l'm doing this. What
am l doing here? l hate downtown!

401
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:18,363
She's probably not even there.
Where are you?

402
00:47:20,237 --> 00:47:21,898
Which building is it?

403
00:47:24,041 --> 00:47:26,009
Push 3.

404
00:47:27,277 --> 00:47:29,507
- See, nobody's there.
- Just wait.

405
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:34,174
l did everything l said l would.
She's not there. l'm going.

406
00:47:34,351 --> 00:47:37,787
l'm sorry.

407
00:47:37,955 --> 00:47:40,583
All right, don't sing.

408
00:47:42,392 --> 00:47:44,883
- Hello?
- Hi... She can't hear you.

409
00:47:45,062 --> 00:47:50,864
l called you last night
about your friend, Sam Wheat.

410
00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:52,194
l told you!

411
00:47:59,343 --> 00:48:02,676
Hey, Molly. l know you´re up there.

412
00:48:02,846 --> 00:48:06,111
l know you hear me.
Sam wants to talk to you.

413
00:48:06,283 --> 00:48:08,217
This is for real!

414
00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:11,479
Remember the starfish at Montego Bay?

415
00:48:11,655 --> 00:48:13,953
How would l know that?

416
00:48:15,025 --> 00:48:18,483
l know about the underwear
you wrote your name on!

417
00:48:18,662 --> 00:48:20,721
l won't forget that.

418
00:48:21,398 --> 00:48:24,595
l know about the picture in Reno.

419
00:48:24,768 --> 00:48:26,326
Hey, Molly!

420
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:32,402
The sweater she knitted,
in the closet, that's too big.

421
00:48:32,576 --> 00:48:37,707
He just told me about the sweater
that you knitted that's too big.

422
00:48:38,548 --> 00:48:40,914
Four sizes.

423
00:48:43,453 --> 00:48:45,512
- Do you hear me?
- l hear you!

424
00:48:45,689 --> 00:48:48,590
- Nobody's talking to you.
- Hear of the phone?

425
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:50,386
Want to kiss my butt?

426
00:48:51,295 --> 00:48:54,196
- l won't stay here all day.
- Thank God!

427
00:48:54,364 --> 00:48:56,229
Oh, shut up!

428
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:00,928
Molly, l'm going to count to three,
and then l'm out of here.

429
00:49:01,104 --> 00:49:03,664
One-two-three.

430
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:06,468
- No, wait.
- No.

431
00:49:06,643 --> 00:49:08,474
lt's Molly.

432
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:15,911
Molly?

433
00:49:19,089 --> 00:49:20,920
l'm Oda Mae Brown.

434
00:49:26,063 --> 00:49:29,260
l don't know you or Sam,
but let me tell you what he did.

435
00:49:29,433 --> 00:49:32,266
He kept me up all night singing
''l'm Henry the Eighth, l am.''

436
00:49:33,937 --> 00:49:37,304
That's how he got me
to go out with him.

437
00:49:37,474 --> 00:49:40,170
Look, l'm sorry.

438
00:49:40,344 --> 00:49:43,973
l just don't believe in this
life after death stuff.

439
00:49:44,147 --> 00:49:47,378
- Tell her she's wrong.
- He says you're wrong.

440
00:49:48,185 --> 00:49:50,415
- You're talking to him right now?
- Yeah.

441
00:49:50,587 --> 00:49:52,748
He asked me to tell you
that you're wrong.

442
00:49:53,724 --> 00:49:57,820
- Where is he?
- l can't see him, l can only hear him.

443
00:49:59,262 --> 00:50:02,629
- l'm right here.
- That doesn't help, Sam.

444
00:50:04,334 --> 00:50:08,168
- l'm holding her hand.
- He says he's holding your hand.

445
00:50:18,749 --> 00:50:23,448
What are you doing?
What do you think you're doing to me?

446
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:26,680
lf you think l'm here for my health,
you're crazy.

447
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:29,655
Sam's dead. He's dead.

448
00:50:30,827 --> 00:50:32,692
- Tell her l love her.
- He says he loves you.

449
00:50:35,766 --> 00:50:37,791
Sam would never say that.

450
00:50:37,968 --> 00:50:40,300
- Tell her ''ditto.''
- What is ''ditto''?

451
00:50:40,470 --> 00:50:43,303
Ditto!

452
00:51:12,002 --> 00:51:15,165
l don't know how l'm doing this.

453
00:51:15,338 --> 00:51:20,708
Confidentially - nothing like this
has ever happened to me before.

454
00:51:20,877 --> 00:51:23,277
Now l can't turn it off.

455
00:51:24,981 --> 00:51:28,508
- ls this him? ls this you?
- Yeah.

456
00:51:28,685 --> 00:51:32,121
Cute! White, but cute.

457
00:51:32,289 --> 00:51:35,315
What l don't understand is,
why did he come back?

458
00:51:35,492 --> 00:51:38,586
- l don't know.
- Why's he still here?

459
00:51:38,762 --> 00:51:41,697
He's stuck, he's in between worlds.

460
00:51:41,865 --> 00:51:45,801
Sometimes the spirit
gets yanked out so quick,

461
00:51:45,969 --> 00:51:48,767
the essence still feels
it has work to do.

462
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:52,807
- Stop rambling.
- l'm not, l'm answering a question.

463
00:51:52,976 --> 00:51:55,410
- He's got an attitude.
- l don't.

464
00:51:55,579 --> 00:51:58,605
Yes, you do.
We're having a little discussion.

465
00:51:58,782 --> 00:52:02,741
lf you didn't, you wouldn't
have raised your voice.

466
00:52:02,919 --> 00:52:07,515
- Oh, goddammit...
- Don't take the Lord's name in vain.

467
00:52:07,691 --> 00:52:09,921
- Would you relax?
- You're the dead guy.

468
00:52:10,093 --> 00:52:12,789
lf you want me to help,
you'd better apologise.

469
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:18,128
That's it, l'm leaving.
Nobody talks to me like that.

470
00:52:18,301 --> 00:52:23,705
- Now, you'd better apologise.
- l'm sorry. l apologise. OK?

471
00:52:24,241 --> 00:52:27,039
Now would you sit down?

472
00:52:27,210 --> 00:52:29,974
- Please?
- He's apologised.

473
00:52:31,648 --> 00:52:33,513
l need you to tell Molly
what l'm saying,

474
00:52:33,683 --> 00:52:37,881
but you have to tell her
word for word, all right?

475
00:52:38,054 --> 00:52:44,482
Yes. He wants me to tell you
what he's saying word for word.

476
00:52:48,665 --> 00:52:51,725
- Molly, you're in danger.
- You can't blurt it out like that!

477
00:52:51,902 --> 00:52:56,271
Quit moving around - you're making
me dizzy. l'll tell her in my own way.

478
00:52:57,374 --> 00:53:01,572
Molly, you're in danger, girl.

479
00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:07,343
- What are you talking about?
- He knows the man who killed him.

480
00:53:07,517 --> 00:53:10,145
His name is Willie Lopez,
and l know where he lives.

481
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:12,720
His name is Willie Lopez,
and he knows where he lives.

482
00:53:12,889 --> 00:53:16,916
- Write it down.
- l ain't no secretary!

483
00:53:17,093 --> 00:53:19,084
Just do it!

484
00:53:21,264 --> 00:53:22,595
He's so testy!

485
00:53:23,867 --> 00:53:28,600
- What do l write?
- lt's 303, Prospect Place, apt. 4D.

486
00:53:28,772 --> 00:53:32,208
303 Prospect Place?

487
00:53:32,375 --> 00:53:35,538
- lt's my neighbourhood.
- Molly, he's got my wallet,

488
00:53:35,712 --> 00:53:38,681
he's got my key, and he was in here.

489
00:53:38,848 --> 00:53:42,375
- He was in here.
- Yesterday, when you came back,

490
00:53:42,552 --> 00:53:45,680
you went upstairs,
you talked to Floyd...

491
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:51,020
When you came back he was here.
He saw everything.

492
00:53:51,194 --> 00:53:55,460
Molly, go to the police.
lt was a set-up. l was murdered.

493
00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:00,226
He says go to the police.
lt was a set-up, he was murdered.

494
00:54:00,403 --> 00:54:05,568
- Somebody else is involved.
- Forget it. l don't want this.

495
00:54:05,742 --> 00:54:08,176
- Where are you going?
- l'm leaving.

496
00:54:08,345 --> 00:54:12,679
l did everything l said l would.
Don't follow me, because l'm finished.

497
00:54:12,849 --> 00:54:16,376
Have a nice life, have a nice death,
goodbye.

498
00:54:19,422 --> 00:54:23,825
There's no one on earth who'd
want this to be true more than me.

499
00:54:23,994 --> 00:54:27,020
You've got to be rational about this.

500
00:54:27,197 --> 00:54:30,223
Sam is no more in this room than...

501
00:54:33,136 --> 00:54:37,596
l understand the need
to hang on to him, l really do.

502
00:54:37,774 --> 00:54:43,076
- But this is absurd!
- lt seems absurd, but it had to be real.

503
00:54:43,246 --> 00:54:47,182
How could you believe
a fortune-teller from Brooklyn?

504
00:54:47,350 --> 00:54:52,811
- l watched them have a conversation.
- l don't buy it, not for a minute.

505
00:54:52,989 --> 00:54:56,425
- What about the things she knew?
- What things?

506
00:54:56,593 --> 00:55:02,259
The photo Sam took of me
on our trip to Reno. We were alone.

507
00:55:02,432 --> 00:55:06,368
And the green underwear
that l wrote my name in.

508
00:55:09,272 --> 00:55:11,467
She said Sam knew who killed him.

509
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:18,179
- That he was set up.
- This is getting deranged.

510
00:55:18,348 --> 00:55:20,748
- She had a name and an address.
- Good, Molly...

511
00:55:20,917 --> 00:55:24,944
Willie Lopez,
303 Prospect Place, apt. 4D.

512
00:55:26,222 --> 00:55:30,784
- This is sick.
- Oh, Carl!

513
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:37,361
Molly, l don't understand
how you could...

514
00:55:39,436 --> 00:55:42,030
..swallow this crap.

515
00:55:42,205 --> 00:55:44,867
This guy may not even exist.

516
00:55:45,041 --> 00:55:49,410
Maybe she's using you
to set someone up.

517
00:55:49,579 --> 00:55:54,107
You're right. You're absolutely right.

518
00:55:54,284 --> 00:55:58,721
- That's what l've got to find out.
- How are you going to do that?

519
00:55:58,888 --> 00:56:01,482
She said Sam wants me
to go to the police.

520
00:56:01,658 --> 00:56:06,425
Sam wants you to go to the police?
Jesus, Moll... !

521
00:56:06,596 --> 00:56:08,655
What are you going to tell them?

522
00:56:08,832 --> 00:56:13,565
That some storefront psychic lady
has been communing with the dead?

523
00:56:13,737 --> 00:56:18,401
Do you know how that sounds?
You're talking ghosts here!

524
00:56:20,076 --> 00:56:21,668
l'm sorry,

525
00:56:21,845 --> 00:56:24,780
this really gets to me.

526
00:56:24,948 --> 00:56:29,510
- lt's OK if you don't believe me.
- l'm trying to, Molly.

527
00:56:33,056 --> 00:56:34,956
Look...

528
00:56:36,526 --> 00:56:41,293
..if it'll make you feel any better,
l'll go check this out.

529
00:56:41,464 --> 00:56:44,456
l want you to try and get some sleep.

530
00:56:44,634 --> 00:56:46,431
OK?

531
00:56:48,838 --> 00:56:52,239
l'll call you in the morning.
Goodnight.

532
00:57:19,302 --> 00:57:21,270
Be careful!

533
00:57:34,751 --> 00:57:38,812
Carl! What the hell
are you doing here?

534
00:57:40,557 --> 00:57:44,584
- Who have you been talking to?
- What do you mean?

535
00:57:44,761 --> 00:57:49,289
Some woman knows all about you.
Where's she getting it from?

536
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:53,664
- l haven't said a word to anybody.
- She knows your name and address.

537
00:57:53,837 --> 00:58:00,333
- How do women know where l live?
- She knows about the murder!

538
00:58:00,510 --> 00:58:03,911
Now, l want you to find this bitch,
whoever she is,

539
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:06,105
and l want you to...

540
00:58:08,051 --> 00:58:10,212
Just get rid of her, OK?

541
00:58:10,987 --> 00:58:16,323
l've got 4 million dollars stuffed in
a goddamn computer.

542
00:58:16,493 --> 00:58:21,328
lf l don't get those codes,
if that money is not transferred soon...

543
00:58:23,266 --> 00:58:27,066
..l'm... dead. We're both dead.

544
00:58:27,237 --> 00:58:30,604
Tell them you only launder money
on the first of the month.

545
00:58:30,773 --> 00:58:35,608
What the hell is wrong with you?
ls everything a joke?

546
00:58:35,778 --> 00:58:39,441
You killed a man.
You were supposed to steal his wallet.

547
00:58:39,616 --> 00:58:42,414
l did you a favour, man,
that was a freebie.

548
00:58:43,686 --> 00:58:46,678
Look, these are drug dealers, OK?

549
00:58:48,124 --> 00:58:52,117
Just don't blow this for me, Willie.
l'd lose my job, go to jail.

550
00:58:53,029 --> 00:58:55,520
$80,000 of that money is mine.

551
00:58:58,735 --> 00:59:02,671
Let me have the keys
to Sam's apartment,

552
00:59:02,839 --> 00:59:05,706
l'll get the address book myself, OK?

553
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:35,698
You goddamn bastard! Why?

554
00:59:35,872 --> 00:59:39,831
You were my friend!

555
00:59:40,009 --> 00:59:42,500
l had a life, goddamn you!

556
00:59:42,679 --> 00:59:44,772
l had a life!

557
00:59:53,022 --> 00:59:56,549
l don't even believe
in this stuff myself.

558
00:59:56,726 --> 00:59:59,251
But she was real.

559
00:59:59,429 --> 01:00:02,364
Do you think l'd come here
if it wasn't real?

560
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:08,828
You told me if l had any new
information, that l should come.

561
01:00:09,005 --> 01:00:11,166
So, here l am.

562
01:00:14,911 --> 01:00:20,816
l know how this sounds. l hear myself
saying it, and l want to cringe.

563
01:00:20,984 --> 01:00:26,354
But she knew things she couldn't have
known. Things Sam only said to me.

564
01:00:26,522 --> 01:00:29,855
According to this psychic lady,

565
01:00:30,026 --> 01:00:34,019
there are ghosts and spirits
all over the place?

566
01:00:34,197 --> 01:00:36,859
Watching us all the time?

567
01:00:39,602 --> 01:00:42,298
l'm never going
to get undressed again.

568
01:00:43,306 --> 01:00:47,936
Excuse me.
l've got more important things to do.

569
01:00:57,954 --> 01:01:03,449
The guy's name is Willie Lopez.
All l'm asking is for you to check it out.

570
01:01:03,626 --> 01:01:08,290
OK. You wait here and let me see
if the guy's got a record.

571
01:01:09,465 --> 01:01:11,831
Right.

572
01:02:12,895 --> 01:02:18,128
- Where's the file on Willie Lopez?
- There's no file for Willie Lopez.

573
01:02:18,301 --> 01:02:22,635
He was probably some old boyfriend
she was trying to get even with.

574
01:02:22,805 --> 01:02:26,764
This psychic woman's
got a long record.

575
01:02:26,943 --> 01:02:29,878
1 967, Shreveport.

576
01:02:30,046 --> 01:02:33,709
Forgery, selling of false lD.

577
01:02:33,883 --> 01:02:36,443
Served one year in 1 971 .

578
01:02:36,619 --> 01:02:39,179
Arrested for fraud,

579
01:02:39,355 --> 01:02:43,223
numbers racketeering,
served ten months, 1 974.

580
01:02:43,392 --> 01:02:47,158
- Look, this is impossible!
- lt goes on and on.

581
01:02:47,330 --> 01:02:51,733
She knew things - private things.
How could she have known all that?

582
01:02:51,901 --> 01:02:54,267
A lot of times they read the obits.

583
01:02:54,437 --> 01:02:57,668
All she had to do
was see the word ''banker.'' Boom.

584
01:02:57,840 --> 01:03:02,436
They even go through your garbage
to find things they can use.

585
01:03:02,612 --> 01:03:06,446
Letters, old papers.
lt doesn't take much.

586
01:03:06,616 --> 01:03:08,208
No.

587
01:03:09,886 --> 01:03:12,446
lt was real.

588
01:03:14,056 --> 01:03:19,119
She knew about a sweater l knitted.

589
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:21,991
And songs we sang.

590
01:03:26,235 --> 01:03:30,501
The trip to Montego Bay.

591
01:03:30,673 --> 01:03:34,541
l'm sorry. l know this is hard.

592
01:03:34,710 --> 01:03:36,200
People want so much to believe.

593
01:03:36,379 --> 01:03:42,579
They're grieving, they're vulnerable.
And they will give anything

594
01:03:42,752 --> 01:03:48,987
for one last moment. Believe me,
these people know what they're doing.

595
01:03:49,158 --> 01:03:54,323
l know how you must feel,
but you know you can press charges.

596
01:03:58,100 --> 01:04:00,068
No.

597
01:04:02,972 --> 01:04:04,837
Thank you.

598
01:04:18,888 --> 01:04:21,049
Oh, God, let this be it.

599
01:04:33,603 --> 01:04:35,468
Yes!

600
01:04:47,149 --> 01:04:50,141
- Hello.
- Eddie, it's Carl Bruner.

601
01:04:50,319 --> 01:04:55,757
Everything's fine. We're all set.
What do you want me to do?

602
01:04:55,925 --> 01:04:59,725
l want you to transfer the money
into a single account

603
01:04:59,896 --> 01:05:02,763
under the name ´´Rita Miller. ´´

604
01:05:02,932 --> 01:05:06,459
Tomorrow, at five minutes
before closing, 3.55 pm,

605
01:05:06,636 --> 01:05:10,333
transfer the full account to
the First lsland Bank ofNassau,

606
01:05:10,506 --> 01:05:14,237
registry number 486-9580.

607
01:05:14,410 --> 01:05:18,847
- Call us when it´s done.
- OK, l've got it.

608
01:05:19,015 --> 01:05:22,644
Just tell Mr Balistrari that there
won't be any more problems, OK.

609
01:05:22,818 --> 01:05:25,810
Yeah, l´ll do that. Good work.

610
01:06:25,548 --> 01:06:29,314
Molly, why can't you hear me?
l need you.

611
01:06:42,131 --> 01:06:45,328
- Who is it?
- lt´s Carl, Molly.

612
01:06:45,501 --> 01:06:49,267
No, don't open the goddamn door!
He's a murderer.

613
01:06:49,438 --> 01:06:52,965
Listen, l know it's late.
l'm sorry to disturb you.

614
01:06:53,142 --> 01:06:56,270
l've been thinking about you all day.

615
01:06:56,445 --> 01:06:59,744
l feel really lousy about last night.

616
01:06:59,915 --> 01:07:04,045
- This supernatural thing...
- Don't worry about it, really. lt's OK.

617
01:07:04,220 --> 01:07:08,054
lt's not. You needed me
to hear you, and l didn't.

618
01:07:08,224 --> 01:07:12,786
l wasn't there for you,
and that was wrong.

619
01:07:12,962 --> 01:07:16,420
lt's just... l just...

620
01:07:16,599 --> 01:07:19,966
l want you to know
that l'm your friend.

621
01:07:21,203 --> 01:07:23,433
- Thanks, Carl.
- You were never her friend.

622
01:07:23,606 --> 01:07:26,666
- That means a lot to me.
- Me, too.

623
01:07:26,842 --> 01:07:30,209
l've brought you some
Japanese apple pears.

624
01:07:32,448 --> 01:07:37,385
- Thanks, that's very sweet.
- Could l come in for a second?

625
01:07:37,553 --> 01:07:40,613
l won't stay long,
it's just been one of those days.

626
01:07:40,790 --> 01:07:43,657
- Yeah, come on in.
- No, Molly.

627
01:07:44,326 --> 01:07:47,193
You seem a little tense. Are you OK?

628
01:07:47,363 --> 01:07:53,632
No, l'm fine. lt's just...
What can l tell you? lt's been tough.

629
01:07:53,803 --> 01:07:55,566
lt still hurts so much.

630
01:07:55,738 --> 01:08:00,368
- You lying snake!
- On top of it, there's stuff at work.

631
01:08:00,543 --> 01:08:04,172
They've given me my own accounts,
which is good.

632
01:08:04,346 --> 01:08:06,906
But l just haven't really
had time to adjust,

633
01:08:07,083 --> 01:08:10,348
to absorb everything.

634
01:08:13,556 --> 01:08:15,023
lt's no big deal.

635
01:08:27,136 --> 01:08:30,367
- Can l have a little more cream?
- Yeah.

636
01:08:31,740 --> 01:08:35,506
Oh, shit!
Jesus, l can't believe l did that.

637
01:08:35,678 --> 01:08:37,339
- Are you all right?
- l'm fine.

638
01:08:40,749 --> 01:08:45,015
- Let me throw that in the washer.
- Don't worry about it. lt's OK.

639
01:08:45,187 --> 01:08:49,123
- Can l get you another shirt?
- No, it'll dry in a minute.

640
01:08:54,897 --> 01:09:00,335
Where were you today? l thought
you were coming into the bank.

641
01:09:00,503 --> 01:09:05,941
l was supposed to, but l didn't
have time. l went to the police.

642
01:09:12,715 --> 01:09:16,947
You did? What did you tell them?
What did they say?

643
01:09:17,119 --> 01:09:19,610
lt was awful.

644
01:09:19,788 --> 01:09:23,246
l felt really stupid.

645
01:09:23,425 --> 01:09:28,260
They brought out a file on this woman
at least ten inches thick.

646
01:09:28,430 --> 01:09:30,955
- Rip-off artist, huh?
- No, Molly!

647
01:09:33,202 --> 01:09:38,162
You know, the sad thing
is that l believed her.

648
01:09:39,141 --> 01:09:41,109
Molly...

649
01:09:42,244 --> 01:09:45,543
..sometimes we need to believe.

650
01:09:45,714 --> 01:09:47,773
Why? What's the point?

651
01:09:47,950 --> 01:09:50,510
lt's not easy to face the realities of life.

652
01:09:50,686 --> 01:09:53,382
Sometimes you've
got to give yourself that.

653
01:09:53,556 --> 01:09:57,322
You've got to remember
the love you guys felt. That's real.

654
01:09:57,493 --> 01:10:00,724
Remember how good Sam was,
how much he loved you.

655
01:10:00,896 --> 01:10:05,162
You were everything to him, Molly.
You were his life.

656
01:10:18,914 --> 01:10:20,711
l feel so alone.

657
01:10:29,024 --> 01:10:32,221
You're not alone, OK.

658
01:10:32,394 --> 01:10:35,852
You've got your work - you're talented.
You're young.

659
01:10:36,665 --> 01:10:39,133
You're fantastically gorgeous.

660
01:10:40,669 --> 01:10:44,002
l don't know what's real anymore.

661
01:10:44,173 --> 01:10:46,403
l don't know what to think.

662
01:10:49,612 --> 01:10:52,103
Just think about Sam.

663
01:10:54,083 --> 01:10:59,419
Think about the time you two guys
had together. How wonderful that was.

664
01:11:03,225 --> 01:11:06,160
Let your feelings out, it's OK.

665
01:11:06,328 --> 01:11:09,320
Life turns on a dime.

666
01:11:10,499 --> 01:11:12,990
You know...?

667
01:11:15,304 --> 01:11:21,174
People think they're forever, that there
is always tomorrow. That's bullshit.

668
01:11:21,343 --> 01:11:24,870
Sam taught us that.

669
01:11:25,047 --> 01:11:27,072
We have to live for now.

670
01:11:29,985 --> 01:11:32,249
For today.

671
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:53,708
- l can't. l'm sorry.
- lt's OK.

672
01:11:53,876 --> 01:11:57,403
- l can't, it's just too soon.
- lt's OK.

673
01:11:57,579 --> 01:12:00,309
You've been great, Carl.

674
01:12:02,785 --> 01:12:05,948
- But l need you to leave.
- lt's OK, l understand.

675
01:12:06,121 --> 01:12:08,112
Please...

676
01:12:13,796 --> 01:12:19,826
Could we just have dinner tomorrow?
Just talk.

677
01:12:20,002 --> 01:12:22,732
- Yeah, sure.
- Great.

678
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:34,070
Hey!

679
01:13:36,845 --> 01:13:39,905
- Get off my train!
- No.

680
01:13:40,749 --> 01:13:42,307
Get off!

681
01:13:42,484 --> 01:13:45,214
Get off! Get off!

682
01:13:45,387 --> 01:13:47,855
Get off! Get out of here!

683
01:13:48,791 --> 01:13:50,452
- Get off!
- No.

684
01:13:50,626 --> 01:13:53,823
Show me how you do that.
l'm not leaving till you teach me.

685
01:13:53,996 --> 01:13:56,021
Get off!

686
01:13:56,198 --> 01:13:57,756
- No.
- Get off!

687
01:14:04,973 --> 01:14:08,067
You stubborn asshole!

688
01:14:10,546 --> 01:14:16,451
What the hell are you doing? You're
trying to move it with your fingers.

689
01:14:16,618 --> 01:14:18,848
You can't push it with your finger.
You're dead.

690
01:14:27,696 --> 01:14:33,100
lt's all in your mind. Your problem
is that you still think you're real.

691
01:14:33,268 --> 01:14:37,136
You think you're wearing those clothes?
That you're crouching there?

692
01:14:37,306 --> 01:14:42,300
Bullshit! You ain't got a body no more.
lt's all up here now.

693
01:14:42,478 --> 01:14:47,916
You want to move something, you've
got to move it with your mind. Focus!

694
01:14:48,083 --> 01:14:52,247
- How? How do you focus?
- l don't know how you focus.

695
01:14:52,421 --> 01:14:54,389
You just focus.

696
01:14:58,160 --> 01:14:59,559
How did you do that?

697
01:14:59,728 --> 01:15:03,459
You take all of your emotions,
all your anger, love, hate.

698
01:15:03,632 --> 01:15:06,999
Push it, down here
into the pit of your stomach,

699
01:15:07,169 --> 01:15:10,002
and then let it explode, like a reactor.

700
01:15:19,748 --> 01:15:21,545
Don't laugh!

701
01:15:45,841 --> 01:15:50,335
- Way to go, kid.
- l did it!

702
01:15:50,512 --> 01:15:51,672
l did it!

703
01:15:52,381 --> 01:15:54,849
Way to go.

704
01:16:00,756 --> 01:16:03,350
From your gut, like l told you.

705
01:16:06,128 --> 01:16:09,586
Give it time.
What else have you got?

706
01:16:17,539 --> 01:16:19,063
How long have you been here?

707
01:16:21,510 --> 01:16:23,478
Since they pushed me.

708
01:16:23,645 --> 01:16:26,341
- Someone pushed you?
- Yeah.

709
01:16:27,115 --> 01:16:29,583
- Who?
- You don't believe me?

710
01:16:29,751 --> 01:16:33,687
You think l fell? You think l jumped?
Well, fuck you!

711
01:16:33,855 --> 01:16:37,586
lt wasn't my time!
l wasn't supposed to go!

712
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:40,057
l'm not supposed to be here.

713
01:16:49,705 --> 01:16:53,197
l'd give anything for a drag!

714
01:16:53,375 --> 01:16:57,505
- Just one drag.
- Are you all right?

715
01:16:57,679 --> 01:17:02,514
Who are you? Why are you
hounding me? Who sent you?

716
01:17:04,553 --> 01:17:07,021
Who sent you?

717
01:17:08,590 --> 01:17:14,153
Leave me alone!

718
01:18:13,855 --> 01:18:17,313
Concentrate, and you'll
probably rouse him.

719
01:18:17,492 --> 01:18:20,984
- What's his name again?
- Orlando.

720
01:18:21,163 --> 01:18:24,758
Orlando, Orlando.
ls there an Orlando here?

721
01:18:24,933 --> 01:18:27,128
- l'm here.
- He's here.

722
01:18:27,302 --> 01:18:31,500
- Sam!
- l'm Orlando. The line's over there.

723
01:18:31,673 --> 01:18:35,939
Where did these ghosts come from?
You can hear them, too?

724
01:18:36,111 --> 01:18:40,070
ln the morning and in the evening.
They come into the shower!

725
01:18:40,248 --> 01:18:43,706
Did you tell every spook in the world
about me?

726
01:18:43,885 --> 01:18:48,720
l got spooks from Jersey. There's stuff
going on you wouldn't believe.

727
01:18:48,890 --> 01:18:53,657
- lt's amazing. You're really doing it!
- Can you please hurry this up?

728
01:18:53,829 --> 01:18:55,854
Chill out!

729
01:18:56,031 --> 01:18:59,398
l need your help again.
There's something we need to do.

730
01:18:59,568 --> 01:19:01,934
l'm not doing anything else with you.

731
01:19:02,104 --> 01:19:07,804
You're holding on to a life that doesn't
want you anymore. Give up the ghost.

732
01:19:07,976 --> 01:19:13,004
- Are you speaking to me?
- Does it look like l'm speaking to you?

733
01:19:13,181 --> 01:19:17,914
You're supposed to be concentrating.
Are you going to try it?

734
01:19:18,086 --> 01:19:20,748
Are you going to get out?
l've got work to do.

735
01:19:20,922 --> 01:19:25,757
Fine, then stay there.
Excuse me, are you ready now?

736
01:19:26,628 --> 01:19:28,357
Let's do it.

737
01:19:28,530 --> 01:19:32,830
Listen, l've got to talk to you now.
l've got a plan.

738
01:19:35,737 --> 01:19:38,331
Oda Mae?

739
01:19:43,578 --> 01:19:45,773
Oda Mae?

740
01:19:47,115 --> 01:19:49,413
Ortisha.

741
01:19:50,218 --> 01:19:54,518
- Orlando! ls that you?
- Where are you at? l can hardly see.

742
01:19:54,689 --> 01:19:59,058
- She's here!
- ln front of you. l'm right here!

743
01:20:03,431 --> 01:20:05,922
Damn, baby, what did you do
to your hair?

744
01:20:08,003 --> 01:20:12,133
Orlando, do you like it?
lt's autumn sunrise.

745
01:20:14,843 --> 01:20:18,074
Get out of me, you son of a bitch!

746
01:20:21,817 --> 01:20:25,082
- Don't ever do that to me again!
- Orlando...?

747
01:20:27,222 --> 01:20:29,122
l can barely move.

748
01:20:29,291 --> 01:20:33,227
You should know better.
Jumping into bodies wipes you out.

749
01:20:33,395 --> 01:20:38,264
- Everybody out!
- What happened to Orlando?

750
01:20:38,433 --> 01:20:42,130
Are you deaf? l said everybody out!

751
01:20:42,304 --> 01:20:47,241
Everybody out! Get out, get out!
Everybody get out!

752
01:20:58,887 --> 01:21:01,583
- Get out!
- Are you the fortune-teller?

753
01:21:01,756 --> 01:21:05,692
- Who are you?
- That's an interesting question.

754
01:21:06,294 --> 01:21:08,592
- Why don't you tell me?
- Willie.

755
01:21:08,763 --> 01:21:10,663
Willie?

756
01:21:10,832 --> 01:21:14,632
- Prospect Place Willie?
- Get out of here fast!

757
01:21:30,051 --> 01:21:31,916
l'm all right.

758
01:21:34,155 --> 01:21:39,650
- We're in trouble. You have to help.
- Who's we? You're already dead.

759
01:21:39,828 --> 01:21:43,525
- They're trying to kill me!
- And they'll be back.

760
01:21:43,698 --> 01:21:47,156
Why don't you find a house to haunt?

761
01:21:47,335 --> 01:21:49,826
Get some chains and rattle them.

762
01:21:50,005 --> 01:21:53,236
l have a plan.
You've got to get some fake lDs.

763
01:21:53,408 --> 01:21:58,141
- Forget it.
- lf you do this, they'll leave you alone.

764
01:22:03,251 --> 01:22:04,878
Scout's honour.

765
01:22:06,154 --> 01:22:08,281
All right.

766
01:22:08,456 --> 01:22:11,084
What exactly do l have to do?

767
01:22:13,261 --> 01:22:14,853
Have you got a nice dress?

768
01:22:18,199 --> 01:22:23,136
- What's wrong with my clothes?
- l made a joke. l love your shoes.

769
01:22:23,305 --> 01:22:27,935
l'm going home. l don't know anything
about banking. l don't know if it'll work.

770
01:22:28,109 --> 01:22:30,737
- Just relax.
- l'm nervous.

771
01:22:30,912 --> 01:22:34,939
l know you're nervous,
but l'll get you through it.

772
01:22:35,116 --> 01:22:37,016
l don't think l should do this.

773
01:22:37,185 --> 01:22:42,248
- We're going to New Accounts.
- l'm giving them no money!

774
01:22:42,424 --> 01:22:45,120
Do what l say, and don't talk!

775
01:22:47,762 --> 01:22:50,162
You're here to fill out a signature card
for a new account.

776
01:22:50,332 --> 01:22:51,799
- Can l help you?
- Yes.

777
01:22:51,967 --> 01:22:55,494
l'm here to fill out
a card for a new account.

778
01:22:55,670 --> 01:22:59,731
- Do you know your account number?
- 926-31 043.

779
01:22:59,908 --> 01:23:03,571
926-31 043.

780
01:23:05,347 --> 01:23:07,178
- Rita Miller.
- What?

781
01:23:07,349 --> 01:23:08,907
Tell her Rita Miller.

782
01:23:09,084 --> 01:23:11,848
Didn't you sign when you
opened the account?

783
01:23:12,020 --> 01:23:14,648
Tell her Carl Bruner did it by phone.

784
01:23:14,823 --> 01:23:18,782
Carl Bruner opened that account
for me by phone,

785
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:22,088
and he's asked me to come in today.

786
01:23:23,331 --> 01:23:25,765
- ls that right?
- Yeah.

787
01:23:27,769 --> 01:23:31,705
Just sign this card
on the bottom line, please.

788
01:23:31,873 --> 01:23:35,070
May l use your pen?

789
01:23:40,281 --> 01:23:42,977
No! Rita Miller!

790
01:23:43,151 --> 01:23:45,779
l'm so sorry.

791
01:23:45,954 --> 01:23:48,752
l need another one.
l signed the wrong name.

792
01:23:55,830 --> 01:23:59,561
Tell her to send it up to the third floor
file, you have a transaction to make.

793
01:23:59,734 --> 01:24:04,967
Make sure this goes to the third floor,
l have a transfusion to make.

794
01:24:05,807 --> 01:24:07,035
Let's go.

795
01:24:07,208 --> 01:24:09,938
You know what l mean... !
Can l keep this pen?

796
01:24:10,111 --> 01:24:14,912
- Yes, sure.
- Thank you so much.

797
01:24:16,084 --> 01:24:19,281
Bye-bye. l love these pens.

798
01:24:20,688 --> 01:24:22,417
What do you want to keep the pen for?

799
01:24:24,192 --> 01:24:27,787
Carl Bruner speaking. Mr Balistrari?

800
01:24:27,962 --> 01:24:30,362
Balistrari? lt´s me, John.

801
01:24:30,532 --> 01:24:32,864
John... Sorry!

802
01:24:33,034 --> 01:24:35,298
What's up?

803
01:24:35,470 --> 01:24:37,563
l´ve got the info
on the Bradley portfolio.

804
01:24:37,739 --> 01:24:43,041
- l'll pick it up later, all right?
- l´ll be here till six.

805
01:24:48,683 --> 01:24:51,777
l couldn't talk you into losing the hat?

806
01:24:51,953 --> 01:24:55,855
Keep messing with me,
you'll be here by yourself.

807
01:24:56,024 --> 01:25:01,052
You're here to see Lyle Ferguson.

808
01:25:01,229 --> 01:25:05,029
- l'm here to see Lyle Ferguson.
- Do you have an appointment?

809
01:25:05,200 --> 01:25:08,169
- No, l'm here for my health.
- Tell him Rita Miller's here!

810
01:25:08,336 --> 01:25:12,773
- Tell him Rita Miller's here.
- Just one moment, please.

811
01:25:12,941 --> 01:25:15,409
- Don't embellish.
- Jawohl!

812
01:25:15,577 --> 01:25:17,772
Excuse me?

813
01:25:20,215 --> 01:25:23,378
This guy Ferguson is a real jerk.

814
01:25:23,551 --> 01:25:26,486
l've known him five years.

815
01:25:26,654 --> 01:25:30,613
- Why are you whispering?
- Just listen!

816
01:25:30,792 --> 01:25:33,625
He's a social moron,
you've got nothing to worry about.

817
01:25:33,795 --> 01:25:41,031
Tell the guard Ferguson knows you,
from the Brewster's Christmas party.

818
01:25:41,202 --> 01:25:43,227
What is this in regards to?

819
01:25:43,404 --> 01:25:48,535
He doesn't remember me? We spent
time at the Brewster's, last Christmas.

820
01:25:48,710 --> 01:25:54,649
He and his lovely wife, Shirley. lt was
beautiful. A big old tree and presents...

821
01:25:58,086 --> 01:26:00,816
Gas!

822
01:26:00,989 --> 01:26:04,618
l get a little gas from time to time.

823
01:26:06,060 --> 01:26:10,190
- Quit poking me!
- Well, don't overdo it!

824
01:26:10,365 --> 01:26:16,270
Ferguson was so drunk, he could've
met Tina Turner and not remember.

825
01:26:22,744 --> 01:26:24,712
Here we go!

826
01:26:27,248 --> 01:26:29,910
Hello.

827
01:26:31,753 --> 01:26:35,211
Of course.
Well, it's been a long time.

828
01:26:35,390 --> 01:26:38,052
- Oh, a long time.
- Ask about Bobby and Snooky.

829
01:26:38,226 --> 01:26:42,754
- How are Bobby and Snooky?
- Fine... fine.

830
01:26:42,931 --> 01:26:45,729
Thank you for asking.

831
01:26:45,900 --> 01:26:49,131
And how is your...

832
01:26:49,304 --> 01:26:52,000
- ..family?
- Oh, couldn't be better.

833
01:26:52,173 --> 01:26:55,108
Well, wonderful.

834
01:26:55,276 --> 01:26:58,268
Ask how they did
on the Gibraltar Securities.

835
01:26:58,446 --> 01:27:02,542
l was wondering, how did you do
on the Gibraltar Securities?

836
01:27:02,717 --> 01:27:08,087
Gibraltar Securities? Well, it looks like
we topped out on that one.

837
01:27:08,256 --> 01:27:11,817
- We sure did.
- That was a very useful tip.

838
01:27:11,993 --> 01:27:14,484
Good old Randy.

839
01:27:14,662 --> 01:27:17,256
Got a good head
on his shoulders... her shoulders.

840
01:27:17,432 --> 01:27:19,992
- Her shoulders.
- Randy.

841
01:27:21,135 --> 01:27:25,629
So, what brings you here today?

842
01:27:25,807 --> 01:27:27,104
l'm closing an account.

843
01:27:27,275 --> 01:27:29,835
Do you have your account number?

844
01:27:30,011 --> 01:27:33,242
- Yes? Yes.
- 926-31 043.

845
01:27:33,414 --> 01:27:34,676
926...

846
01:27:34,849 --> 01:27:39,309
..31 043. ls that right?

847
01:27:47,662 --> 01:27:53,032
Well, Rita - it looks like you'll be
withdrawing four million dollars.

848
01:27:53,201 --> 01:27:56,364
- Four million dollars!
- Say yes.

849
01:27:56,537 --> 01:27:58,732
- ls that correct?
- Yes.

850
01:27:58,906 --> 01:28:04,469
Yes. That's correct.

851
01:28:07,849 --> 01:28:11,785
- How would you like that?
- Tens and twenties.

852
01:28:11,953 --> 01:28:14,114
- Pardon?
- Tell him a cashier's cheque.

853
01:28:14,289 --> 01:28:18,919
- A cashier's cheque.
- Cashier's cheque. Fine!

854
01:28:19,093 --> 01:28:23,223
Of course, you know
we require identification.

855
01:28:23,398 --> 01:28:27,732
lt's a procedural thing.

856
01:28:38,079 --> 01:28:41,742
Thank you. l'll be right back.

857
01:28:42,884 --> 01:28:45,250
Four million dollars!

858
01:28:51,359 --> 01:28:55,261
Get me the First lsland Bank
of Nassau. lt's on the Rolodex.

859
01:29:05,039 --> 01:29:08,497
Now, we have some things
for you to sign here.

860
01:29:08,676 --> 01:29:14,239
This officially closes the account.

861
01:29:14,415 --> 01:29:16,315
Sign ''Rita Miller.''

862
01:29:19,120 --> 01:29:21,179
Miller - that's my name.

863
01:29:21,356 --> 01:29:23,756
My name - Rita Miller.

864
01:29:23,925 --> 01:29:25,119
My name.

865
01:29:30,031 --> 01:29:33,125
l'll be right back.

866
01:29:33,301 --> 01:29:37,328
- Just anywhere?
- Right here.

867
01:29:41,709 --> 01:29:43,040
Fine.

868
01:29:43,211 --> 01:29:46,476
The cheque...

869
01:29:46,647 --> 01:29:49,912
..here you are.

870
01:29:58,893 --> 01:30:01,521
Mama took the money
from the oil wells,

871
01:30:01,696 --> 01:30:05,359
and she sunk it into gas pumps.

872
01:30:05,533 --> 01:30:09,367
And those gas stations have five
or six of those things, so it's lucrative.

873
01:30:09,537 --> 01:30:13,303
- Oda Mae, we've got to go.
- Got to go now.

874
01:30:13,474 --> 01:30:17,911
lt's been a pleasure doing business.
May l keep the pen?

875
01:30:18,846 --> 01:30:21,076
Say goodnight to Bobby
and Snooky for me.

876
01:30:21,249 --> 01:30:23,046
Bye-bye.

877
01:30:28,923 --> 01:30:30,914
What is wrong?

878
01:30:40,368 --> 01:30:43,166
Excuse me - Lyle?

879
01:30:43,337 --> 01:30:44,861
Molly Jensen.

880
01:30:45,039 --> 01:30:49,339
The woman you were doing business
with. What did she want?

881
01:30:49,510 --> 01:30:52,638
Did it have anything to do
with me or Sam?

882
01:30:52,814 --> 01:30:56,944
- Sam? No.
- That was Oda Mae Brown, right?

883
01:30:57,118 --> 01:31:01,384
Her name was Rita Miller.
She was closing an account.

884
01:31:01,556 --> 01:31:04,320
ls there a problem?

885
01:31:04,492 --> 01:31:07,120
No. l guess not.

886
01:31:37,458 --> 01:31:40,256
Carl? ls something wrong?

887
01:31:40,428 --> 01:31:43,591
Did somebody play
with the computers?

888
01:31:43,764 --> 01:31:47,165
- One of my accounts is closed.
- What's wrong?

889
01:31:47,335 --> 01:31:53,205
- Do you want me to call someone?
- lt's OK.

890
01:31:56,644 --> 01:32:00,239
Four million dollars! What am l
going to do with this money?

891
01:32:00,414 --> 01:32:03,315
l'm going to buy the building.
No, l'll buy the block.

892
01:32:03,484 --> 01:32:08,581
l'm going to make
my sister go to a fat farm.

893
01:32:08,756 --> 01:32:12,817
Wait, Oda Mae.
Take the cheque out of your purse.

894
01:32:12,994 --> 01:32:16,828
You're right, l'll put it
where nobody can get it.

895
01:32:16,998 --> 01:32:19,466
No. Endorse it.

896
01:32:20,401 --> 01:32:22,926
No, if l drop it,
then somebody will get it.

897
01:32:23,104 --> 01:32:27,040
lt's not yours.
l never said you would get the money.

898
01:32:27,975 --> 01:32:32,810
This is blood money. l was killed
for this money. Endorse the cheque.

899
01:32:32,980 --> 01:32:37,144
- What are you going to do with it?
- Look over there.

900
01:32:38,286 --> 01:32:39,810
To your left.

901
01:32:43,057 --> 01:32:47,323
You don't think l'm giving this
to a bunch of nuns?

902
01:32:47,495 --> 01:32:51,659
Otherwise they will track you down.
Your only protection is to get rid of it.

903
01:32:51,832 --> 01:32:54,426
You're kidding me!

904
01:32:54,602 --> 01:32:57,332
You'll go to heaven!

905
01:32:57,505 --> 01:33:00,838
l want to go to a bank
and cash this cheque.

906
01:33:04,612 --> 01:33:08,241
- Hello.
- You'll thank me later.

907
01:33:10,685 --> 01:33:13,620
- Endorse it ''Rita Miller.''
- l know!

908
01:33:13,788 --> 01:33:16,120
Make it out to St Joseph's Shelter.

909
01:33:16,290 --> 01:33:19,384
l don't believe
you're making me do this!

910
01:33:24,565 --> 01:33:27,932
- Give it to her.
- l just want to feel it in my fingers.

911
01:33:28,102 --> 01:33:31,469
- Just give her the cheque!
- l will!

912
01:33:38,613 --> 01:33:41,878
- Give her the cheque!
- l will!

913
01:33:44,552 --> 01:33:48,215
Bless you, child. Bless you.

914
01:33:53,561 --> 01:33:54,994
Give it to her.

915
01:33:55,696 --> 01:33:57,994
Let go. Let go!

916
01:34:05,306 --> 01:34:09,675
- l'm proud of you.
- l don't care. Stay away from me!

917
01:34:09,844 --> 01:34:13,143
What'll that nun do with it?
She can't go buy underwear!

918
01:34:13,314 --> 01:34:16,147
Leave me alone!
Never talk to me again.

919
01:34:16,317 --> 01:34:18,148
You're wonderful, Oda Mae!

920
01:34:54,288 --> 01:34:57,519
Go ahead, search! You'll never find it.

921
01:34:58,893 --> 01:35:04,695
They're going to kill you and Willie.
You're going to be fertiliser.

922
01:35:04,865 --> 01:35:08,096
They're going to bury you
next to Jimmy Hoffa.

923
01:35:51,879 --> 01:35:54,211
Who's doing that?

924
01:35:54,381 --> 01:35:57,009
Who's doing that?

925
01:36:12,032 --> 01:36:16,628
Hi. Where were you?
l thought we were having dinner.

926
01:36:16,804 --> 01:36:20,535
- Things got a little crazy, l forgot.
- A little trouble at the bank.

927
01:36:20,708 --> 01:36:25,975
l wish you'd have called.
l've been worried.

928
01:36:26,147 --> 01:36:30,743
- l've got to ask you about something.
- He needs to borrow $4,000,000.

929
01:36:30,918 --> 01:36:35,355
When you said you thought
Sam was talking to you,

930
01:36:35,523 --> 01:36:39,050
- what did he say to you?
- Why?

931
01:36:39,226 --> 01:36:44,323
Listen, l want to know exactly what
this psychic lady told you.

932
01:36:44,498 --> 01:36:46,989
Carl, let me go! Stop this!

933
01:36:49,804 --> 01:36:53,865
lt doesn't matter. lt wasn't real.

934
01:36:54,041 --> 01:36:56,635
What the hell's happened to you?

935
01:36:56,811 --> 01:37:00,303
Does this have anything to do
with her being at the bank today?

936
01:37:03,184 --> 01:37:05,345
At the bank?

937
01:37:05,519 --> 01:37:08,352
Ferguson said she closed an account.

938
01:37:08,856 --> 01:37:14,021
Her name isn't even Oda Mae Brown.
lt's Rita Miller.

939
01:37:17,131 --> 01:37:19,793
Carl. Are you all right?

940
01:37:21,702 --> 01:37:23,294
lt's just my stomach.

941
01:37:27,775 --> 01:37:30,869
Do you have some Pepto-Bismol?

942
01:37:31,045 --> 01:37:35,482
- Cyanide.
- lt's upstairs. Sit down, l'll get it.

943
01:37:41,755 --> 01:37:45,885
What's wrong?
Does little Carl have a tummy ache?

944
01:37:52,633 --> 01:37:55,033
Now do you believe in ghosts?

945
01:37:58,672 --> 01:38:00,867
l'll set the place on fire!

946
01:38:08,883 --> 01:38:11,215
- l'll cut her throat.
- Carl!

947
01:38:12,887 --> 01:38:17,654
l swear to God. l'll cut her throat.

948
01:38:19,226 --> 01:38:22,662
l need that money.
l want it tonight, at 1 1 o'clock.

949
01:38:22,830 --> 01:38:27,858
lf that psychic lady does not
bring it here, Molly is dead, OK?

950
01:38:28,769 --> 01:38:30,498
Carl, who are you talking to?

951
01:38:30,671 --> 01:38:33,936
Nothing. Molly, l have to go.

952
01:38:34,108 --> 01:38:37,305
l can't explain it now,
but there's a problem at the bank.

953
01:38:37,478 --> 01:38:41,380
- You're scaring me.
- l can't talk now, l'll be back.

954
01:38:41,548 --> 01:38:43,948
- Why not now?
- l can't talk now.

955
01:38:44,118 --> 01:38:50,318
l'll come back at 1 1 o'clock, OK?
l'm sorry, but it's really important.

956
01:38:50,491 --> 01:38:52,015
- Eleven!
- Oda Mae!

957
01:38:55,963 --> 01:39:01,128
l´m Arsenio Hall. Don´t try
to adjust your television. l´m black.

958
01:39:02,102 --> 01:39:06,038
- l want to watch ''Love Connection.''
- l love ''Love Connection.''

959
01:39:06,206 --> 01:39:08,868
Leave that! That's Arsenio.

960
01:39:09,043 --> 01:39:12,137
You love ''Love Connection,''
send your picture in.

961
01:39:12,313 --> 01:39:15,680
- She did!
- They just haven't answered yet.

962
01:39:15,849 --> 01:39:18,818
- Oda Mae!
- Sam?

963
01:39:18,986 --> 01:39:21,978
We're in trouble.
They want the cheque.

964
01:39:22,156 --> 01:39:26,490
The cheque you said
they would never know about?

965
01:39:26,660 --> 01:39:28,821
- What's happening?
- They're here!

966
01:39:28,996 --> 01:39:31,521
Get out of here, now! Go, go!

967
01:39:43,744 --> 01:39:45,974
Knock on the doors!

968
01:39:46,146 --> 01:39:48,273
Help!

969
01:39:48,449 --> 01:39:52,078
- Let us in!
- Who are you kidding?

970
01:40:02,696 --> 01:40:07,360
What are you doing?
The cat don't like visitors.

971
01:40:16,910 --> 01:40:20,869
They're going to get us. Where's Sam?

972
01:40:21,048 --> 01:40:24,916
- lt looks like the bitch just left.
- l'll check downstairs.

973
01:40:36,330 --> 01:40:37,729
Carl?

974
01:41:27,781 --> 01:41:29,009
Willie!

975
01:41:38,325 --> 01:41:41,226
You've got a serious problem, man.

976
01:42:02,950 --> 01:42:06,010
Help me! Help!

977
01:43:02,476 --> 01:43:04,774
That dude is dead.

978
01:43:09,750 --> 01:43:11,217
You're dead, Willie.

979
01:43:41,315 --> 01:43:44,876
Help me!

980
01:44:05,606 --> 01:44:07,938
Tell the driver to hurry.

981
01:44:08,108 --> 01:44:13,171
- Can you step on it, please.
- l'm driving as fast as l can.

982
01:44:20,821 --> 01:44:22,015
Problems?

983
01:44:30,097 --> 01:44:32,930
- Carl, is that you?
- lt's me, Oda Mae.

984
01:44:33,100 --> 01:44:38,470
l know what you think of me, but we've
got to talk. You are in serious danger.

985
01:44:39,206 --> 01:44:43,267
- l've got Sam here with me.
- Get the hell out of here!

986
01:44:43,443 --> 01:44:46,310
- lm calling the police!
- Good. Tell her to do it!

987
01:44:46,480 --> 01:44:51,474
Fine. We want you to call the police.
But you´ve got to let us in.

988
01:44:52,452 --> 01:44:56,889
Don't you get it? Sam wasn't
accidentally killed, he was murdered.

989
01:44:57,057 --> 01:44:59,855
He found out
that Carl was laundering money.

990
01:45:00,027 --> 01:45:02,928
Carl is dangerous. He tried to kill me.

991
01:45:03,096 --> 01:45:07,430
He's going to try to kill you, too.
You are in deep, deep trouble.

992
01:45:07,601 --> 01:45:13,062
Why are you doing this to me?
Do you hear me?

993
01:45:13,240 --> 01:45:17,574
Why are you doing this to me?

994
01:45:18,478 --> 01:45:24,041
Oda Mae. Tell her she's wearing
the shirt that l spilt the margarita on,

995
01:45:24,217 --> 01:45:27,243
and the earrings
l gave her for Christmas.

996
01:45:27,421 --> 01:45:31,380
Sam says you're wearing the shirt
he spilt the margarita on,

997
01:45:31,558 --> 01:45:34,959
and the earrings
he gave you for Christmas.

998
01:45:40,267 --> 01:45:43,668
Don't you see?
l'm not a fake! Not about this.

999
01:45:49,176 --> 01:45:51,474
- Give me a penny.
- What?

1000
01:45:51,645 --> 01:45:57,982
- Push a penny under the door, now!
- What are you talking about?

1001
01:46:34,454 --> 01:46:38,220
- Tell her it's for luck.
- Sam says it's for luck.

1002
01:47:14,361 --> 01:47:16,420
Between Green and Mercer on Prince.

1003
01:47:16,596 --> 01:47:19,793
lt's the grey building
across from the post office.

1004
01:47:19,966 --> 01:47:24,130
Thanks, Sergeant. Please hurry!
We'll be waiting.

1005
01:47:24,304 --> 01:47:27,205
- They're on their way.
- Good.

1006
01:47:28,742 --> 01:47:32,439
- What do we do now?
