1
00:00:01,571 --> 00:00:02,500
(light music)

2
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:16,820
- [Narrator] The following dramatization

3
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:18,240
is based on court documents,

4
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,060
published accounts, and interviews,

5
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:21,380
and is told from the perspective

6
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:23,183
of Sonia Jacobs and Micki Dickoff.

7
00:00:25,489 --> 00:00:27,989
(light music)

8
00:01:20,076 --> 00:01:21,350
- I water it every day.

9
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:22,453
Not too much.

10
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:25,150
No matter where we are,

11
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:27,130
we'll always remember that it's here,

12
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:28,697
getting bigger and bigger.

13
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,820
- [Both] Sticks and
stones, nails and pins,

14
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:35,320
Micki and Sunny will always
be friends (giggling).

15
00:01:36,904 --> 00:01:37,737
- [Woman] Micki!

16
00:01:37,737 --> 00:01:39,023
Micki, it's time to go!

17
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:56,810
- We're like sisters now,
Sunny, for as long as we live.

18
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:58,560
- But, I'll never see you again.

19
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,510
I'm moving too far.

20
00:02:00,716 --> 00:02:02,709
- [Woman] Micki, hurry, we're leaving!

21
00:02:02,709 --> 00:02:04,302
- Yes, you will.

22
00:02:04,302 --> 00:02:06,802
(light music)

23
00:02:32,495 --> 00:02:35,203
(buzzer buzzing)
- Okay, okay, I'm coming.

24
00:02:39,696 --> 00:02:42,283
(laughing) If I'd known
it was you, Christie.

25
00:02:43,995 --> 00:02:46,656
(woman laughing)

26
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:48,850
I don't suppose we could
postpone this again?

27
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:50,750
- Oh, no way.

28
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:53,450
When we win that award,
honey, we are gonna look good.

29
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:58,280
- I wear more than this at the beach.

30
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,600
- How 'bout this?

31
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,748
Red.

32
00:03:00,748 --> 00:03:02,170
Lovely.

33
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:03,550
- Got anything in leopard?

34
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:07,063
- No, but I have this.

35
00:03:08,304 --> 00:03:10,070
- Mm-hm, this is it, yeah.

36
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:12,420
This is the first step to selling out.

37
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:14,160
Before you know it,
I'll be wearing girdles

38
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,360
and having my nails done.

39
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,160
- It's the 90s, Micki.

40
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:20,480
Even humanitarian, politically
correct, freedom fighters

41
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,710
can enjoy playing dress
up once in a while.

42
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:26,470
Besides, I get my nails done and I manage

43
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:28,450
to hang on to my soul.

44
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:32,380
- Lawyers don't have souls.
(phone ringing)

45
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:35,100
- I have elbow length gloves.

46
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:37,550
- Ah, great, maybe you
can wrestle me up a tiara.

47
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:39,760
Hello?

48
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,593
Mom.

49
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,393
Yeah.

50
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,263
It's okay.

51
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:49,930
No, I'll give the tickets to my agent,

52
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:51,430
he was dying to go anyway.

53
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:53,480
and I think he's got a crush on Christie.

54
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,023
I'll call you if I win.

55
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:00,023
Sunny.

56
00:04:01,197 --> 00:04:02,147
No, what about her?

57
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,210
Yeah, yeah, right.

58
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:11,043
Okay.

59
00:04:11,043 --> 00:04:11,876
Bye.

60
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:15,280
- They're not coming.

61
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,113
- No.

62
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:20,973
Some old friends are coming
to visit from New York.

63
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:23,638
- You upset?

64
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:24,471
- Not about that.

65
00:04:24,471 --> 00:04:27,040
She told me that my best friend

66
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,223
when I was a kid has been
in prison for 15 years.

67
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:32,400
What for?

68
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,763
- Killing two cops.

69
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,210
And the guy she was living
with is being executed in May.

70
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:42,280
- Nice friends, Mick.

71
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,200
- I don't know him, but Sunny was

72
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:46,923
the nicest kid in the world.

73
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:49,793
Now she's a cop killer?

74
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,510
- [Jeremy] This award is our calling card.

75
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:56,240
- [Micki] Would you put that thing away?

76
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,680
- Oh strut a little, darling,
it's good for business.

77
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,800
- Well, there's David Hayne.

78
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,860
- Oh!
- He wants to meet you.

79
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:04,360
- Jeremy, I've gotten
blisters from glad handing.

80
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,710
- Micki, dear, the studios
are crawling over him

81
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:07,920
to finances his next movie.

82
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,873
- He's not bad looking either.

83
00:05:08,873 --> 00:05:10,880
- Listen, he loved your AIDS documentary

84
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,750
and if you plan right-
- I don't want

85
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:15,050
to play anyone, Jeremy.
- Oh, he's not asking

86
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:16,250
you to sell out,

87
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:18,050
just be a bit more social.

88
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:19,890
- Micki, people don't see documentaries,

89
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:23,210
they see movies and
David gets movies made.

90
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:24,223
So, work with me.

91
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:26,043
- Lead the way.

92
00:05:32,575 --> 00:05:35,075
(light music)

93
00:06:22,603 --> 00:06:25,270
(phone ringing)

94
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,553
Hello?

95
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:34,713
Sunny Jacobs?

96
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:41,120
Yes, operator I'll accept.

97
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,550
So, Sunny's parents
thought it was my puppy.

98
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:45,040
My folks thought it was hers.

99
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,740
Anyway, we got away
with it for a few weeks.

100
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,290
- That was 30 years ago.

101
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:52,260
If you're flying 3,000
miles to have a reunion

102
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:53,590
with the same sweet little girl,

103
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:54,960
you're gonna be disappointed.

104
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,720
- I am also seeing my parents.

105
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,900
- Oh yeah, right.

106
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,693
What about our meeting with David Hayne?

107
00:06:59,693 --> 00:07:00,526
- Eh.

108
00:07:00,526 --> 00:07:02,140
- Hey, I've got my law
practice to fall back on,

109
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:03,950
but you, you've been
waiting your whole life

110
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:05,790
for this opportunity.
- I'll reschedule.

111
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:07,620
- Oh, she's been in prison for years.

112
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,650
Why is this suddenly so important?

113
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:10,650
- I don't know.

114
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:13,720
We were like sisters
growing up, like twins.

115
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,290
We'd dress in the same outfits.

116
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:19,313
We (laughing), we talked in secret codes.

117
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,910
She was a good kid, Christie.

118
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:25,320
How could she do something like this?

119
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,510
It just doesn't make sense.

120
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:28,810
- Murderers come from all kinds

121
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:31,603
of neighborhoods, Micki, even yours.

122
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:34,750
- I've gotta see her.

123
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:38,870
(light music)

124
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:07,583
- [Officer] Count, all
inmates report to their cells.

125
00:08:09,563 --> 00:08:10,396
Recall.

126
00:08:11,406 --> 00:08:12,239
Recall.

127
00:08:13,278 --> 00:08:15,778
(light music)

128
00:08:28,684 --> 00:08:31,853
(door slamming)

129
00:08:31,853 --> 00:08:34,436
(light music)

130
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:08,820
- Quick hug.

131
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:09,820
It's all they allow.

132
00:09:16,434 --> 00:09:19,517
- This is weird, you're all grown up.

133
00:09:21,824 --> 00:09:25,230
You know, your face hasn't really changed.

134
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:27,773
- Neither has yours,
except for the wrinkles.

135
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:31,090
- You certainly haven't
lost any of your charm.

136
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:37,100
You really look good.

137
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:41,503
- Well, I exercise, I do yoga,

138
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:44,133
get plenty of beauty rest.

139
00:09:46,957 --> 00:09:51,010
- Would you like a soda or something?

140
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:52,023
- Yeah.
- Okay.

141
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:59,830
They feed you in here?
- Yeah, prison food.

142
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:02,740
Not a lot of choices
if you're a vegetarian.

143
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,260
- You are a vegetarian?

144
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:05,783
- Yeah, I have been for years.

145
00:10:12,172 --> 00:10:15,187
- Hey, look what I found.

146
00:10:17,807 --> 00:10:20,373
- Oh, I kept mine too.

147
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,413
All my stuff's been in storage
though since my parents died.

148
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:27,023
- I'm sorry, Sunny.

149
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,693
Mom told me about the plane crash.

150
00:10:31,684 --> 00:10:33,930
- They let me go to the funeral.

151
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:35,980
I only got to see the kids
for about five minutes

152
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:37,330
before they hauled me away.

153
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,033
- That's awful.

154
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:44,840
- Well, at least my parents
got to see me get off death row

155
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,863
before they died.

156
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:48,620
Jury recommended life you know,

157
00:10:49,941 --> 00:10:51,230
but the judge overruled them.

158
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:52,860
- Why?

159
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,350
- I don't know.

160
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:56,710
But, I think he used
to be a state trooper.

161
00:10:56,710 --> 00:11:00,170
Anyway an appeals court finally commuted

162
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:03,053
my sentence to life, but not Jesse's.

163
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,000
- They allow you to see him?

164
00:11:07,795 --> 00:11:11,807
- Not since the trial, but we
write to each other every day.

165
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,660
- Tell me about your kids.

166
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:20,753
- Eric is 25.
- Oh, God.

167
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,050
- He has a little girl.

168
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:27,283
- Wait a minute.

169
00:11:27,283 --> 00:11:29,243
That makes you a grandmother.

170
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:31,223
- Ha!

171
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,340
- What about your daughter?

172
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:37,173
- Tina.

173
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:41,037
She was just a baby when I got here,.

174
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:47,183
She's been with a foster
family since my parents died.

175
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,353
It's been hard.

176
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:55,520
Can we talk about something else?

177
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,353
- Sure.

178
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:01,400
- [Man] Officer Houston,
report to the attorney room.

179
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,590
Officer Sandy Wall-
- It was kind of strange,

180
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:09,250
seeing her have to so long.

181
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:11,460
It's funny, she hasn't changed that much.

182
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:13,510
- Get used to hearing
from folks you ain't seen.

183
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:14,650
Jesse's execution will bring out

184
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:16,243
all the ghouls and do-gooders.

185
00:12:17,386 --> 00:12:18,400
- Micki didn't come because of Jessie.

186
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,432
She was my best friend.

187
00:12:20,432 --> 00:12:21,265
And you know when your
kids, your best friend

188
00:12:21,265 --> 00:12:23,770
is like the most important
thing in the whole world.

189
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:26,060
- Hey as long as she
keeps you in candy bars,

190
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:26,960
she's got my vote.

191
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:36,690
- I don't know how you packed everything

192
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:37,820
in this one little bag.

193
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,900
- Oh, nobody dresses up
like they used to, Leon,

194
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,780
people don't care.

195
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:43,800
- People like to be comfortable.

196
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,200
- Oh, you know, with a little more makeup

197
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,940
and a new hairstyle, you
could be so much prettier.

198
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:51,000
I'm sure I could get you
into my hairdresser tomorrow.

199
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,750
- I'm visiting Sunny tomorrow, mom.

200
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,760
- You're going back to that prison?

201
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:56,810
- No, I'm going to meet it her

202
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:59,390
for cocktails at the Fontainebleau.

203
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:01,450
- There's no need to be sarcastic.

204
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:02,283
- I'm sorry.

205
00:13:03,232 --> 00:13:04,160
I'm tired.

206
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,650
- Well, if you wanna
spend all your time here

207
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:07,240
in a place like that,

208
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,410
visiting with someone you
haven't laid eyes on in 30 years.

209
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:10,243
Fine.

210
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,816
I just don't understand you.

211
00:13:13,816 --> 00:13:15,149
- You never did.

212
00:13:19,771 --> 00:13:20,871
- Welcome home, honey.

213
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:23,043
- Thanks dad.

214
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:29,430
- Do you remember that tree we planted?

215
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:30,940
- Oh God.
- I wonder if

216
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:31,773
it's still there.

217
00:13:31,773 --> 00:13:34,350
- No, I went back to
Elmont eight years ago

218
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:36,120
and I tried to find it.

219
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,603
All the trees looked alike.

220
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:41,420
You know, I'm tired of talking about me.

221
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,337
Tell me about you.

222
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:49,453
- One day is pretty much like
another, not a lot to tell.

223
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:53,560
- How about what the hell happened?

224
00:13:56,970 --> 00:14:00,100
- Go ahead, say it, everybody else has.

225
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,740
How could I have been stupid enough

226
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,993
to get involved with an ex-convict?

227
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:08,000
- Sunny, I'm just trying to understand.

228
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,070
- Me two.

229
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:10,410
Of the two of us I always figured

230
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:12,310
you'd be the one to end up in trouble.

231
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:14,503
- You're right.

232
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,090
- I don't know if you can understand,

233
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:23,660
you haven't changed that
much from when we were kids.

234
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:28,660
Me, I feel like I've already
lived three or four lives

235
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:31,813
and the person I was when I met Jesse,

236
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:38,480
let's just say he was
dangerous and exciting

237
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,653
and I liked that.

238
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:44,053
- Hm, paper's called you Bonnie and Clyde.

239
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:46,300
- That crap sold a lot of papers,

240
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,850
but it had absolutely
nothing to do with the truth.

241
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:54,523
We were just struggling to get
by, trying to raise our kids.

242
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,630
Mom asked me once why I didn't run

243
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:03,330
when I found out Jesse had been in prison.

244
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:06,753
Truth is he didn't tell me right
away, by then I was hooked.

245
00:15:10,493 --> 00:15:12,110
- [Jesse] Come on baby girl.

246
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:15,550
- [Sunny] By the time Tina was
born, we were a real family.

247
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:17,843
Jesse always treated
Eric like his own son.

248
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:21,653
We didn't have much money,
but we had each other.

249
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:25,709
And we were in love.

250
00:15:25,709 --> 00:15:28,292
(upbeat music)

251
00:15:42,792 --> 00:15:43,875
- I love you.

252
00:15:45,207 --> 00:15:46,290
- I love you.

253
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:55,533
- Listen I gotta go out of
town next week on business.

254
00:15:57,187 --> 00:15:58,020
- Thought you were gonna paint the mural

255
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:59,447
for the daycare center.

256
00:15:59,447 --> 00:16:00,863
- Yeah, well, so did I

257
00:16:00,863 --> 00:16:04,555
till somebody told 'em
I'd been in the joint.

258
00:16:04,555 --> 00:16:05,388
Anyway, I found this guy,

259
00:16:05,388 --> 00:16:07,920
he's got a couple nine
millimeters for sale pretty cheap.

260
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:08,753
No, listen.

261
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:12,994
I can re-blue 'em and sell 'em.

262
00:16:12,994 --> 00:16:14,994
- I don't like this thing with the guns.

263
00:16:15,831 --> 00:16:18,750
- Oh Sunny, look, as long as your name's

264
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,713
on that bill of sale, everything's legal.

265
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:25,528
Sunny, it's something I can
do and we need the money.

266
00:16:25,528 --> 00:16:28,195
- Jesse, I don't want you to go.

267
00:16:33,896 --> 00:16:36,313
- How 'bout you come with me?

268
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:04,016
- Eric, will you please
turn that thing down?

269
00:17:04,016 --> 00:17:07,266
(cartoons blaring)

270
00:17:07,266 --> 00:17:08,099
- I wanna go home.

271
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:09,990
We've been here a week.

272
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:11,380
When's the car gonna be fixed?

273
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:13,090
- Honey, I don't know.

274
00:17:13,090 --> 00:17:14,890
Jesse said he would take care of it.

275
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:17,633
- Can I at least go outside?
- No.

276
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,560
- I hate it here.

277
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,940
- Pack up, we're living.
- Now?

278
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:38,220
- Yeah, this is Walter Rhodes,

279
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,920
he's gonna give us a ride upstate.

280
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:43,920
Hey man, why don't you grab
a cup of coffee or something?

281
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:44,753
- No problem.

282
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:50,040
- Honey, can't we wait till morning?

283
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,490
- No, he wants to go tonight.

284
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:53,493
- He gives me the creeps.

285
00:17:53,493 --> 00:17:54,326
Who is he?

286
00:17:54,326 --> 00:17:56,701
- Just a guy I met up in prison.

287
00:17:56,701 --> 00:17:58,143
Look, it's just a ride.

288
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:00,050
You wanna get outta here or not?

289
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:01,150
- What's wrong, mommy.

290
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,530
- Nothing, honey.

291
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:06,930
Get up, we're gonna go home.

292
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:11,393
Come on, sweetheart.

293
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:36,103
- [Sunny] Why are we stopping now?

294
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:39,063
- 'Cause your chauffeur
needs some shuteye.

295
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:42,807
You don't want me to fall
asleep and kill us all do you?

296
00:18:43,862 --> 00:18:45,713
- It'll be daylight soon, I'm tired too.

297
00:18:53,378 --> 00:18:55,878
(light music)

298
00:19:17,721 --> 00:19:20,471
(dramatic music)

299
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:27,770
- [Officer] This your gun?

300
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:30,620
- What's the problem officer.
- Is this yours?

301
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:31,660
- [Rhodes] Yes, sir.

302
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:33,083
- License and registration.

303
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:34,919
- What are you hassling us for?

304
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:35,980
We're not doing anything.

305
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:38,074
- You just sit there and keep quiet.

306
00:19:38,074 --> 00:19:39,152
- [Eric] Mommy?

307
00:19:39,152 --> 00:19:41,610
- [Sunny] Lie there, it's okay.

308
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:43,370
- We're parole violators,
man, we're screwed.

309
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:44,240
- Please be cool.

310
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:46,113
- This is 1B12, I need a 10-29.

311
00:19:48,005 --> 00:19:49,890
- Is that gun one of ours?

312
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:51,776
- Not anymore.
(baby crying)

313
00:19:51,776 --> 00:19:52,609
Shut that kid up.

314
00:19:52,609 --> 00:19:54,890
- Would you relax?

315
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:56,290
- [Sunny] I'm scared, Jesse.

316
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:58,420
- Step out of the car.

317
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:00,220
Keep your hands where I can see 'em.

318
00:20:02,109 --> 00:20:03,960
(dramatic music)

319
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,120
You too.

320
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,210
- What the hell'd I do?

321
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:07,563
- Just step out of the car.

322
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:10,460
- I can't, the door's broken.

323
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:12,283
- You, step to the front of the car.

324
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:14,640
Get out!

325
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,390
(dramatic music)

326
00:20:20,659 --> 00:20:22,258
- Mommy.
- It's okay, honey.

327
00:20:22,258 --> 00:20:24,258
Try to find Tina's bear.

328
00:20:25,229 --> 00:20:28,212
(Jesse yelling)

329
00:20:28,212 --> 00:20:31,501
(body slamming)

330
00:20:31,501 --> 00:20:32,918
- Found it, here.

331
00:20:33,963 --> 00:20:36,796
(gunshots firing)

332
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,860
- [Man] Visiting hours are now over.

333
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:41,710
- Who shot the cops?

334
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:43,580
- I didn't see anything.

335
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:46,720
All I know is I didn't do
it and neither did Jesse.

336
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,460
- If you didn't see, how do you know?

337
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:50,490
- No physical contact.

338
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:51,700
- I've gotta go.

339
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:52,633
Thanks for coming.

340
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:54,973
- Sunny.

341
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,090
When can I come back?

342
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:58,000
- Whenever.

343
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,323
I'm not going anywhere.

344
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:13,030
Yeah, I figured she was guilty
too until I heard her side.

345
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:15,030
- [Christie] So, you believe her?

346
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:16,080
- In my heart I do.

347
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,833
- And what does your head tell you?

348
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:21,510
Come on, you run across an inmate

349
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:22,920
who says he's guilty of anything,

350
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,690
be sure and let me know.

351
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:26,160
- Yeah, but what if
she's telling the truth?

352
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,480
What if she's innocent?

353
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,570
- Well, in this country,

354
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:30,610
you're innocent until proven guilty

355
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:32,380
and she's been proven guilty.

356
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:34,200
You're obsessing about this, you know?

357
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,033
- No, I'm not.

358
00:21:35,033 --> 00:21:37,630
- [Christie] You have a real
shot at getting the financing

359
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:39,280
for your AIDS feature, Micki.

360
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,470
The one thing you've talked
about for the last five years

361
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:43,300
and you're blowing it off.

362
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:45,450
- I'm sorry, I know you don't understand,

363
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:47,450
but I've got to do this.

364
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:50,033
- Okay, it's your life.

365
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,653
Take care of yourself.

366
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:55,253
- Bye.

367
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:02,440
- [Man] Attention on the compound,

368
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,550
attention on the compound,

369
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:07,200
medical will be open for five minutes.

370
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,410
All inmates requiring medication,

371
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:11,403
report to medical immediately.

372
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:22,163
- Hi.
- Hi.

373
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,800
- Who was that?

374
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:27,180
Kay Tafero, Jesse's mom.

375
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:29,430
She wants me to confess to the shootings.

376
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:30,573
Try and save Jesse.

377
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:34,740
- I can't believe she'd asked
you to do something like that.

378
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:35,573
- I can.

379
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,493
I'm a mother too.

380
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,710
I said I'd talked to my lawyers about it,

381
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:43,150
I'm in for life anyway.

382
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:44,000
- Why should you?

383
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,640
If it weren't for him-
- Don't.

384
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:49,530
I love him.

385
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:50,730
- Sunny, I don't get it.

386
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,950
Why aren't you angry with
him for what happened?

387
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:56,660
- Why should I be?

388
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:58,110
So I'd have someone to blame?

389
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:01,710
- Well, maybe I'm not that grown up.

390
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:02,980
I think he ruined your life.

391
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:03,813
- Micki.

392
00:23:03,813 --> 00:23:05,340
- You don't think he ruined your life?

393
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:07,333
- I made my own choices.

394
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:14,133
- Sunny, when I think about
what you went through that day,

395
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,633
how did you do it?

396
00:23:19,152 --> 00:23:20,350
- If I'd been alone,

397
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:23,120
I really think I would have fallen apart,

398
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,933
but I had those kids to think about.

399
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:28,820
- [Rhodes] Come on dammit, come on!

400
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:31,320
- Let's go, hurry.

401
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:33,940
He's got the gun, Sunny.

402
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:35,040
- Tell him to go without us.

403
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,033
- Move it, now!

404
00:23:37,347 --> 00:23:39,402
- Come on baby girl.
- Hurry!

405
00:23:39,402 --> 00:23:40,624
- Come on, Eric.

406
00:23:40,624 --> 00:23:41,541
- Let's go!

407
00:23:42,763 --> 00:23:44,843
- [Sunny] Oh my God, honey don't look.

408
00:23:44,843 --> 00:23:47,063
(radio chatter)

409
00:23:47,063 --> 00:23:48,162
- Come on!
- Don't be scared,

410
00:23:48,162 --> 00:23:49,245
I've got you.

411
00:23:50,081 --> 00:23:51,636
- Here, take Tina.

412
00:23:51,636 --> 00:23:53,799
- Okay, it's okay.
(baby crying)

413
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:55,799
- [Dispatcher] Respond!

414
00:23:59,224 --> 00:24:01,749
(engine revving)

415
00:24:01,749 --> 00:24:04,582
(tires squealing)

416
00:24:09,105 --> 00:24:11,855
(dramatic music)

417
00:24:17,712 --> 00:24:22,032
- [Dispatcher] All units,
we have shots fired.

418
00:24:22,032 --> 00:24:23,115
Officer down.

419
00:24:27,769 --> 00:24:30,108
(dramatic music)

420
00:24:30,108 --> 00:24:31,208
- We need another car.

421
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:34,203
We're in this together.

422
00:24:35,446 --> 00:24:36,947
- [Sunny] Be careful, Jesse.

423
00:24:36,947 --> 00:24:38,329
- [Jesse] It'll be okay.

424
00:24:38,329 --> 00:24:40,162
I love you.
- Let's go.

425
00:24:43,559 --> 00:24:47,726
- Need your car, mister.
- Hey, what are you doing?

426
00:24:50,652 --> 00:24:53,569
(tires screeching)

427
00:24:56,137 --> 00:24:58,887
(dramatic music)

428
00:25:04,145 --> 00:25:06,645
(baby crying)

429
00:25:10,135 --> 00:25:12,522
- [Man] All vehicles pull to the right.

430
00:25:12,522 --> 00:25:15,219
All vehicles pull to the right.

431
00:25:15,219 --> 00:25:17,400
Have your driver's license
and registration ready.

432
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,952
Stay in the car.

433
00:25:18,952 --> 00:25:22,119
(helicopter thumping)

434
00:25:23,383 --> 00:25:24,236
- Good morning, can I
see your driver's license

435
00:25:24,236 --> 00:25:26,319
and registration, please?

436
00:25:27,356 --> 00:25:28,758
- Damn!

437
00:25:28,758 --> 00:25:29,591
(dramatic music)
(tires squealing)

438
00:25:29,591 --> 00:25:32,260
- [Jesse] What are you doing, man?

439
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:33,093
Rhodes!

440
00:25:34,619 --> 00:25:35,918
- [Sunny] Jesse, the kids!

441
00:25:35,918 --> 00:25:38,138
- Rhodes!
- Stop that car!

442
00:25:38,138 --> 00:25:39,818
Stop or we'll shoot!

443
00:25:39,818 --> 00:25:42,567
Stop!
(gun firing)

444
00:25:42,567 --> 00:25:44,047
- Oh no!
- Get down!

445
00:25:44,047 --> 00:25:46,547
(guns firing)

446
00:25:50,969 --> 00:25:55,969
(Rhodes screaming)
(tires squealing)

447
00:25:56,168 --> 00:25:59,646
(dramatic music)

448
00:25:59,646 --> 00:26:01,479
- [Rhodes] Oh, my leg.

449
00:26:02,536 --> 00:26:03,604
- [Cop] Everyone out!

450
00:26:03,604 --> 00:26:06,447
Let's go, let's go.
- Come on, Eric.

451
00:26:06,447 --> 00:26:07,320
- [Cop] Let's see those hands.

452
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,620
Back outta there.

453
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:10,580
Slow, guy, nice and slow.

454
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:11,413
- [Cop] Everybody outta the car

455
00:26:11,413 --> 00:26:13,140
with your hands up where I can see 'em!

456
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:14,673
- Get outta there, come on!

457
00:26:14,673 --> 00:26:16,062
Hands up, let's see your hands.

458
00:26:16,062 --> 00:26:17,217
- Move it slow.

459
00:26:17,217 --> 00:26:19,120
- [Cop] Get your hands on the hood.

460
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,061
Put your hands behind you.

461
00:26:21,061 --> 00:26:22,229
- [Cop] Fall back will you please.

462
00:26:22,229 --> 00:26:24,064
(rifle smacking)
- Stay back, stay back.

463
00:26:24,064 --> 00:26:24,897
Stay back.

464
00:26:26,181 --> 00:26:27,684
Let's go!

465
00:26:27,684 --> 00:26:28,517
- Stop it!

466
00:26:28,517 --> 00:26:30,044
Stop it, you're gonna kill him!

467
00:26:30,044 --> 00:26:31,232
Jesse?

468
00:26:31,232 --> 00:26:32,065
Jesse?

469
00:26:33,921 --> 00:26:35,158
- Mommy!

470
00:26:35,158 --> 00:26:35,991
Mommy!

471
00:26:36,838 --> 00:26:39,304
- Wait, wait, those are my children.

472
00:26:39,304 --> 00:26:41,412
- Mommy!
- Don't take my children!

473
00:26:41,412 --> 00:26:42,245
Why?

474
00:26:45,989 --> 00:26:48,489
Please, we didn't do anything!

475
00:26:49,746 --> 00:26:51,067
I want my children!

476
00:26:51,067 --> 00:26:52,070
- Two good me are dead because of you,

477
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:53,700
now shut up!

478
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:55,450
- I want my children.

479
00:27:02,182 --> 00:27:03,015
(hand pounding)

480
00:27:03,015 --> 00:27:04,290
Beauty rest later, sit up!

481
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:06,790
- I told you over and over.

482
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:07,700
- Tell it again.

483
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:09,943
I never get tired of hearing a good story.

484
00:27:12,689 --> 00:27:13,522
Huh?

485
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:19,050
(man whispering)

486
00:27:20,668 --> 00:27:21,668
- All right.

487
00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:24,890
Ballistics match those slugs

488
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:26,440
we dug outta those two troopers

489
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:29,893
to the nine millimeter we
found on your boyfriend.

490
00:27:29,893 --> 00:27:32,020
- I told you, I didn't see what happened.

491
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:33,570
Don't give me this see no evil,

492
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:35,010
hear no evil crap!
- I just wanna know

493
00:27:35,010 --> 00:27:36,533
what happened to my kids.

494
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:40,340
- If I don't start hearing the truth,

495
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:42,213
you may never see those kids again.

496
00:27:49,155 --> 00:27:50,705
- [Eric] Mommy!

497
00:27:50,705 --> 00:27:52,057
Mommy!
- What are you doing, hey!

498
00:27:52,057 --> 00:27:53,318
Hey!
- Eric?

499
00:27:53,318 --> 00:27:54,245
- [Eric] I want my mommy.

500
00:27:54,245 --> 00:27:55,433
- Hey!

501
00:27:55,433 --> 00:27:58,460
- Baby, are you okay?
- Mommy I'm scared,

502
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:00,780
they keep asking me stuff.
- Let's go.

503
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:01,613
- Tell them you want grandma.

504
00:28:01,613 --> 00:28:03,020
Tell them to call grandma.

505
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:03,853
Eric, I love you.

506
00:28:03,853 --> 00:28:04,686
I love you.

507
00:28:04,686 --> 00:28:06,380
Tell Tina mommy loves her.

508
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:07,213
- Mommy!

509
00:28:07,213 --> 00:28:08,546
Mommy!

510
00:28:08,546 --> 00:28:09,379
Mommy!

511
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:15,633
- They kept him in a
detention center for weeks.

512
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:18,153
Can you imagine that?

513
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:21,313
A little boy all alone and scared.

514
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,343
My parents finally got him out.

515
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:30,823
It's amazing he never lost faith in me.

516
00:28:33,290 --> 00:28:34,193
- What about Tina?

517
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:38,083
- Tina gave up on me a long time ago.

518
00:28:39,530 --> 00:28:41,093
- Sunny it's okay, let it go.

519
00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:45,323
You don't show emotion in here, Micki.

520
00:28:48,067 --> 00:28:50,117
If they see me crying I'll go to lock up.

521
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:53,053
- They do that?

522
00:28:56,490 --> 00:28:57,913
- I brought some pictures.

523
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:05,023
Mom and dad brought them to
see me every chance they could.

524
00:29:06,810 --> 00:29:08,733
Tina was only seven when they died.

525
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:14,413
- Sunny, you lost your whole life.

526
00:29:16,306 --> 00:29:17,139
- Micki.

527
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,283
Micki, I have a life.

528
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:23,880
Maybe not the one I would have preferred,

529
00:29:24,876 --> 00:29:27,363
but I make the best of it.

530
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:29,580
- You're something.

531
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:36,003
You spend 15 years in prison
for something you didn't do.

532
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:41,130
- But I was there and those men died

533
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:43,910
and there isn't a day goes by

534
00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:45,910
that I don't think about their children.

535
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,350
- You didn't kill those two men, Sunny.

536
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:54,620
You weren't committing a
crime when it happened,

537
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:56,463
so how could they convict you?

538
00:29:57,472 --> 00:30:00,993
- Well, it wasn't exactly a fair fight.

539
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:11,290
- Hi Sonia, Andy Bent.

540
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:12,830
Sorry I'm late.

541
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:14,310
This is just a formality.

542
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:15,590
They'll read the charges against you,

543
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:18,130
you'll make your plea and be outta here.

544
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,700
I'm your lawyer.

545
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:23,050
Judge Zackler appointed me.

546
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:27,763
Good morning Mr. Satz.
- Andy.

547
00:30:29,972 --> 00:30:32,722
(dramatic music)

548
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:37,293
- Jesse.

549
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:41,653
Where's Rhodes?

550
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,400
- They're arraigning him separately.

551
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,250
Part of his deal.

552
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:47,093
- What deal?

553
00:30:48,892 --> 00:30:50,180
- I thought you knew.

554
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:53,711
He's going to testify that you
and Tafero killed those cops.

555
00:30:53,711 --> 00:30:56,461
(dramatic music)

556
00:30:57,710 --> 00:30:58,790
- The press was playing up

557
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:01,910
the Bonnie and Clyde thing, cop killers.

558
00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:04,970
And the DA was relying
heavily on Rhode's testimony.

559
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:06,810
I kept thinking nobody in their right mind

560
00:31:06,810 --> 00:31:07,807
would believe him.

561
00:31:07,807 --> 00:31:10,560
- [Satz] And after Sonia fired the gun?

562
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,420
- Jesse got away from the other cop,

563
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:15,013
grabbed the gun from
Sonia, and opened fire.

564
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:18,850
- I have no further questions.

565
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:20,813
- You may step down.

566
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:26,140
- Rhodes played right to the jury.

567
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:28,320
I couldn't believe what was happening,

568
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,010
but no matter how much I complained,

569
00:31:30,010 --> 00:31:32,813
Andy kept saying Satz had no case.

570
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:35,960
And then the nightmare got worse.

571
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:39,343
Lucky for Satz, along came Brenda Isham.

572
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:42,151
- [Satz] Where did you meet Sonia Jacobs?

573
00:31:42,151 --> 00:31:44,000
- We were in the same cell.

574
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,553
- Did you ever discuss her case?

575
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,870
- She said she was glad she killed him.

576
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:52,100
She'd do it again.
(hand smacking)

577
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:55,701
- [Judge] Court is adjourned
till 9:00 AM tomorrow morning.

578
00:31:55,701 --> 00:31:58,368
(gavel rapping)

579
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:03,070
- I never exchanged one word
with that girl, I swear.

580
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:04,340
I want you to put me on the stand.

581
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:05,810
- Satz would tear you apart.

582
00:32:05,810 --> 00:32:09,120
Don't worry, I'm preserving
everything for the appeal.

583
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,520
- You keep talking about an appeal,

584
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:12,290
if there's no evidence, how
can they find me guilty?

585
00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:14,583
- Sonia, I'm an experienced
lawyer, I know what I'm doing.

586
00:32:14,583 --> 00:32:15,993
They have no case.

587
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,353
- [Sunny] I read somewhere

588
00:32:20,353 --> 00:32:22,750
that if a jury has voted to acquit,

589
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:24,810
they'll usually make eye
contact with the defendant

590
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:26,410
when they return.

591
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:28,160
None of them looked at me that day.

592
00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:33,040
- Jury has reached a verdict in this case.

593
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,460
In the charge of first degree murder,

594
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:38,030
we find the defendant,
Sonia Jacobs, guilty.

595
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:43,030
(people mumbling)
(gavel rapping)

596
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:44,560
- Jesse!

597
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,927
- I'll write you every day.

598
00:32:48,142 --> 00:32:53,142
I love you, Sonia.

599
00:32:54,810 --> 00:32:57,120
- Sonia, will you beg for mercy?

600
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,380
- I don't want mercy, I wanted justice.

601
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:00,392
That's all.

602
00:33:00,392 --> 00:33:03,142
(dramatic music)

603
00:33:08,815 --> 00:33:11,482
- How have you survived in here?

604
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:18,060
- Well death row will prepare
you for just about anything.

605
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:19,010
- What do you mean?

606
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:23,800
- Four years, seven months, 19 days

607
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:28,630
in a little box, all alone,
and room for six paces.

608
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:31,890
And that's what I did all
day, I'd pace back and forth,

609
00:33:31,890 --> 00:33:33,840
and back and forth, and back and forth.

610
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:37,736
You know what they call you on the row?

611
00:33:37,736 --> 00:33:39,363
- No.
- Dead man.

612
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:42,070
'Cause that's what you are.

613
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:43,063
The walking dead.

614
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:46,830
And I was only allowed to read two books.

615
00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:48,773
The Bible and a law book.

616
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:53,300
I guess they figured
either way, live or die,

617
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:54,403
I'd be prepared.

618
00:34:03,951 --> 00:34:05,356
- Can you talk to me, please?

619
00:34:05,356 --> 00:34:08,773
Please, please, will somebody talk to me!

620
00:34:10,666 --> 00:34:12,335
(tray crashing)

621
00:34:12,335 --> 00:34:17,335
(hands pounding)
Please, somebody talk to me!

622
00:34:20,933 --> 00:34:22,560
I knew I was losing my mind

623
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,523
and that pretty soon there
would be nothing left inside.

624
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:28,510
So, I learned to meditate,

625
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:30,897
to examine my life and my situation.

626
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:35,070
And I realized there were
two ways of looking at it.

627
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:37,623
I could be in a cell or a sanctuary.

628
00:34:38,730 --> 00:34:42,123
I couldn't change where I was,
so I changed my perception.

629
00:34:51,327 --> 00:34:52,577
- I wanna help.

630
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,240
- Got a hacksaw on ya?

631
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:56,173
- I'm serious.

632
00:34:58,270 --> 00:34:59,830
- Why?

633
00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:01,030
- You don't belong here.

634
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:05,080
Sunny, what they've done
to you makes me sick.

635
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:08,380
I'll do everything I can to help you,

636
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:09,460
but there's one condition.

637
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:11,963
You tell me the truth, always.

638
00:35:14,984 --> 00:35:16,180
I wanna talk to your lawyers.

639
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:17,090
- You'll like them.

640
00:35:17,090 --> 00:35:19,740
They've worked for free ever
since the money ran out.

641
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,963
- I wanna meet Eric and Tina.

642
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:26,720
- [Tina] Why are you doing this?

643
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,443
- Because I think she's innocent.

644
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,480
I thought you'd be happy, Tina.

645
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,370
- Happy?

646
00:35:32,370 --> 00:35:34,660
What difference does it make if I'm happy?

647
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:37,030
I mean, you think anybody gives a damn?

648
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:38,630
- [Eric] Hey Tina, knock it off.

649
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,000
- Do whatever you want.

650
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,450
I don't even know why I came.

651
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:49,563
- I'm sorry.

652
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:55,057
She needs to blame someone and mom's it.

653
00:35:55,057 --> 00:35:58,463
- Yeah, but you don't blame her.

654
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:00,763
- I remember.

655
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:04,710
It happened just the way she told you.

656
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:06,310
Just the way she told everybody.

657
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:10,140
Nobody was interested in the truth.

658
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:12,873
And the hardest part is knowing

659
00:36:12,873 --> 00:36:14,670
that I might've been able to help her.

660
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:16,550
She should've let me testify.

661
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:18,677
- Why didn't she?

662
00:36:18,677 --> 00:36:21,850
- She said I'd I'd been through enough

663
00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:26,850
and she said she would
go to the electric chair

664
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:30,250
before she'd let them rip me
apart on the witness stand.

665
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:31,750
- Eric, you were a little kid.

666
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:35,800
Even if the prosecutor didn't manage

667
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,620
to trip you up on some detail,

668
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:41,330
sweetie, they would've
figured you were lying

669
00:36:41,330 --> 00:36:42,693
just to protect your mom.

670
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:54,763
Anyway, I don't mean to
intrude, but I wanna help.

671
00:36:55,770 --> 00:36:56,833
- Quite the contrary.

672
00:36:57,950 --> 00:37:00,350
We're grateful for any
help that you can give us.

673
00:37:00,350 --> 00:37:02,250
A fresh perspective would be nice.

674
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:03,260
- Sunny's final appeal

675
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:05,250
has to be submitted within six months.

676
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:08,380
- This is Holly Strafer, Sunny's
co-counsel, Micki Dickoff.

677
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,510
- Nice to meet you.

678
00:37:12,890 --> 00:37:14,420
Six months?

679
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:15,820
- It really isn't that long.

680
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:18,030
If the appeal fails,

681
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:20,930
and the odds are 10,000 to one it will,

682
00:37:20,930 --> 00:37:24,140
Sunny will be in prison
for the rest of her life.

683
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:27,680
So, where would you like to begin?

684
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,430
- What have you got for me to read?

685
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:36,990
Christie?

686
00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:37,823
It's me.

687
00:37:40,770 --> 00:37:43,693
Listen, can you come
out here for a few days?

688
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,273
Hmm.

689
00:37:49,469 --> 00:37:51,970
- I guess she could take the sofa.

690
00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:55,780
- Mom, I wouldn't ask Christie
to stay here without asking.

691
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:57,453
I rented an apartment today.

692
00:37:59,970 --> 00:38:02,140
- Well, it just defies reason.

693
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:04,640
First, you give up a
perfectly good teaching job

694
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,190
to pursue a film career.

695
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:08,290
And now that something's
finally come of that,

696
00:38:08,290 --> 00:38:10,080
you throw it all away for this.

697
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,650
- What would you like me to do?

698
00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:12,930
Just forget about it?

699
00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:13,830
Go back to LA?

700
00:38:13,830 --> 00:38:15,343
She was my best friend.

701
00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:18,970
- And what if you're wrong?

702
00:38:18,970 --> 00:38:22,110
I mean, have you even considered that?

703
00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:23,423
What if she is a murderer?

704
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:27,230
- Well, you'll get to repeat
your favorite expression.

705
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:28,780
You were right and I was wrong.

706
00:38:31,070 --> 00:38:33,800
Her lawyer should have let her testify.

707
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,070
If the jury had heard her,

708
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:36,300
they never would have convicted her.

709
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:37,350
- Read this.

710
00:38:37,350 --> 00:38:38,790
They found six guns in the car,

711
00:38:38,790 --> 00:38:39,950
all registered to Sunny.

712
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:43,283
It says she confessed to two
cops and she lied, Micki.

713
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:00,260
- You told the cop, you
were only a hitchhiker?

714
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:02,370
That you didn't even know Rhodes.

715
00:39:02,370 --> 00:39:03,203
Or Jesse?

716
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:06,000
- I was terrified.

717
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,470
I'd been through hell that night.

718
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:09,070
I would have said anything, anything

719
00:39:09,070 --> 00:39:11,080
to get out of there and
get back to my kids.

720
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,890
- What about those confessions?

721
00:39:12,890 --> 00:39:16,143
Micki, I never confessed to anyone.

722
00:39:17,531 --> 00:39:20,840
- But all those guns, they were
all registered in your name.

723
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,340
- That's right they were registered,

724
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:24,293
meaning I didn't break any laws.

725
00:39:25,610 --> 00:39:27,900
- Don't play games with me, Sunny.

726
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:32,720
- Look, I made a lot of stupid
mistakes and believe me,

727
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:34,610
I've had plenty of time to think about it,

728
00:39:34,610 --> 00:39:36,980
but I've also had enough
judgment to last three lifetimes

729
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:39,880
and I sure as hell don't need it from you.

730
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,810
- Now you listen to me,

731
00:39:41,810 --> 00:39:45,630
I've learned a few things
in the last 15 years myself

732
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:48,950
and one of them is only
a fool accepts everything

733
00:39:48,950 --> 00:39:50,780
on blind faith.

734
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:53,230
I have put my life on hold for you.

735
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:55,430
- Hey, you contacted me, remember.

736
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:57,430
If you've changed your
mind, go on, get outta here.

737
00:39:57,430 --> 00:39:59,130
Find somebody else's flag to wave.

738
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:01,297
- What the hell is that supposed to mean?

739
00:40:01,297 --> 00:40:02,930
- Oh, come on, that's
what you do isn't it?

740
00:40:02,930 --> 00:40:05,603
Just go from one lost cause
to another, Saint Micki.

741
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:16,513
I'm sorry.

742
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:19,383
I'm so sorry, I didn't mean that.

743
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:21,773
Forgive me?

744
00:40:30,170 --> 00:40:31,003
- Sunny?

745
00:40:36,930 --> 00:40:39,033
Okay, but if you lie to me, I'm gone.

746
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,950
- Okay, I've written down
everything I can think of,

747
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:48,303
questions to ask, documents to request.

748
00:40:49,742 --> 00:40:50,650
- I don't know how to thank you.

749
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:53,250
- Oh, this is such a long shot, Micki.

750
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:54,560
- Yeah.

751
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:57,793
I am scared to death how I
could screw things up for her?

752
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:00,423
Oh, I'm way over my head.

753
00:41:01,713 --> 00:41:03,963
But, I couldn't quit
now even if I wanted to.

754
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:06,963
- You take care.

755
00:41:11,588 --> 00:41:12,421
- Bye.

756
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,433
Bye!

757
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:24,360
- Sunny, is there any way

758
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:26,273
I can get ahold of Jesse's records?

759
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:30,423
- Kay has them, but I doubt
if she'll be very helpful.

760
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:34,460
Jose said it would be pointless
for me to say I did it.

761
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:37,120
She's pretty upset.

762
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,520
- How can she hold that against you?

763
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:39,473
It's crazy.

764
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,100
- They're about to execute her only child.

765
00:41:44,470 --> 00:41:45,483
You'd be crazy too.

766
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,623
- [Man] Visiting hours are now over.

767
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:52,973
- He's got a stay.

768
00:41:54,668 --> 00:41:56,540
There's a chance for
clemency, don't give up hope.

769
00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:58,003
- There is no hope.

770
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:01,380
The media, the lawyers, the politicians,

771
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:02,813
have already decided.

772
00:42:04,852 --> 00:42:05,685
Bye.

773
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:21,100
- Any word about Jesse?

774
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:21,933
- No.

775
00:42:23,850 --> 00:42:26,650
- If Brenda Isham recanted
her testimony, would it help?

776
00:42:26,650 --> 00:42:29,170
- If we could prove she
was coached or coerced,

777
00:42:29,170 --> 00:42:30,830
but first you have to find her.

778
00:42:30,830 --> 00:42:32,800
Then get her to admit she's a liar.

779
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,150
Not likely.

780
00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:36,593
- She lied, plain and
simple, we gotta find her.

781
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:40,290
We've had a private detective
looking for her for months.

782
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:43,380
- Jesse's stay has been lifted.

783
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:44,630
The execution is tonight.

784
00:42:49,235 --> 00:42:51,985
(dramatic music)

785
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:06,433
- Sunny?

786
00:43:07,645 --> 00:43:08,478
- Jesse?

787
00:43:13,316 --> 00:43:14,149
- 1977.

788
00:43:15,407 --> 00:43:17,513
That's the last time I heard your voice.

789
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:22,171
- Sometimes I thought about you so hard,

790
00:43:22,171 --> 00:43:25,623
I'm sure you could hear
me, hear my thoughts.

791
00:43:27,630 --> 00:43:29,080
- Oh, I wish I could see you.

792
00:43:32,292 --> 00:43:33,125
- Me too.

793
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:38,403
- Mom came by.

794
00:43:40,062 --> 00:43:41,088
Tina too.

795
00:43:41,088 --> 00:43:41,921
- Tina?

796
00:43:43,610 --> 00:43:44,910
- They strip searched her.

797
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:49,490
15-years-old and they strip searched her.

798
00:43:53,610 --> 00:43:54,693
- Is she okay?

799
00:43:57,190 --> 00:43:58,813
- Oh yeah, she was so grown up.

800
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:02,160
I told her I almost didn't recognize her

801
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:03,883
'cause she was wearing makeup.

802
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:07,710
She did the damnedest thing.

803
00:44:09,070 --> 00:44:11,670
She took out a tissue
and wiped the makeup off,

804
00:44:11,670 --> 00:44:12,920
right there at the table.

805
00:44:20,830 --> 00:44:22,630
Listen, I know this is hard for you.

806
00:44:25,110 --> 00:44:26,610
- It's okay, baby, I love you.

807
00:44:28,872 --> 00:44:29,705
- I'm gonna make this easier,

808
00:44:29,705 --> 00:44:31,050
I'm gonna hang up first, okay?

809
00:44:34,558 --> 00:44:38,963
- I love you.

810
00:44:38,963 --> 00:44:40,046
- I love you.

811
00:44:41,566 --> 00:44:42,649
- I love you.

812
00:44:47,494 --> 00:44:48,577
- I love you.

813
00:44:53,843 --> 00:44:56,510
(crowd yelling)

814
00:45:25,330 --> 00:45:26,163
- Hey Micki, real zoo, huh?

815
00:45:26,163 --> 00:45:27,847
Must be 10 times worse at Jesse's prison.

816
00:45:27,847 --> 00:45:29,560
- I need to see her, Bob.

817
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:30,620
- Wish there was something I could do,

818
00:45:30,620 --> 00:45:31,684
but I can't.

819
00:45:31,684 --> 00:45:34,351
(crowd yelling)

820
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:38,359
- I know about the rules,
just give me a break.

821
00:45:38,359 --> 00:45:39,853
Five minutes, just five minutes.

822
00:45:39,853 --> 00:45:40,969
Please!

823
00:45:40,969 --> 00:45:42,430
- [Man] He's dead!

824
00:45:42,430 --> 00:45:45,210
You won't believe it, they
pulled the switch three times

825
00:45:45,210 --> 00:45:46,777
and his head caught on fire.

826
00:45:46,777 --> 00:45:49,527
(crowd cheering)

827
00:45:55,493 --> 00:45:57,493
- [Reporter] Tina, Tina!

828
00:46:01,411 --> 00:46:02,244
(phone ringing)

829
00:46:02,244 --> 00:46:03,410
- Should I get that?

830
00:46:06,285 --> 00:46:08,952
(phone ringing)

831
00:46:10,113 --> 00:46:12,020
- [Sunny] Kay?

832
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:14,433
- I'm sorry, my grandmother
can't talk right now.

833
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:16,273
- Tina?

834
00:46:19,060 --> 00:46:20,263
Tina, it's me, mom.

835
00:46:23,808 --> 00:46:24,658
Honey talk to me.

836
00:46:29,150 --> 00:46:30,193
Tina, please.

837
00:47:12,374 --> 00:47:15,750
(knuckles knocking`)

838
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:18,030
- Don't you vultures ever give up?

839
00:47:18,030 --> 00:47:19,810
It's been three months.

840
00:47:19,810 --> 00:47:22,630
Find another story and leave me alone.

841
00:47:22,630 --> 00:47:25,223
- I'm a friend of Sunny
Jacobs, Mrs. Tafero,

842
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:27,163
I'm not a reporter.

843
00:47:29,010 --> 00:47:32,750
Please, I'm just trying to save my friend,

844
00:47:32,750 --> 00:47:34,650
the way you were trying to save Jesse.

845
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:46,580
- He was an artist.

846
00:47:46,580 --> 00:47:49,720
He studied Japanese
brush painting in prison,

847
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:50,883
loved to read.

848
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:54,140
He was a writer, you know?

849
00:47:58,410 --> 00:48:00,360
They burned him at the stake

850
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:02,030
and your friend could have saved him.

851
00:48:02,030 --> 00:48:03,170
- You're wrong.

852
00:48:03,170 --> 00:48:05,520
Sunny's the only person in the whole world

853
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:07,570
who loved him as much as you do.

854
00:48:07,570 --> 00:48:09,930
- She could have lied for him.

855
00:48:09,930 --> 00:48:13,723
- Mrs. Tafero, Sunny is not
responsible for Jesse's death.

856
00:48:15,140 --> 00:48:18,600
If you need to blame
someone, blame Walter Rhodes,

857
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:22,540
blame Michael Satz, blame the
public's need for revenge,

858
00:48:22,540 --> 00:48:23,503
but not Sunny.

859
00:48:26,350 --> 00:48:27,603
She loved your son.

860
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:31,250
- Do you think he was innocent?

861
00:48:37,860 --> 00:48:39,553
Transcripts are in those boxes.

862
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:43,870
- Thank you.

863
00:48:43,870 --> 00:48:44,853
- I want them back.

864
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:51,020
- Yeah, but I was only three
weeks late with my payment.

865
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:53,870
Can't you raise my credit limit?

866
00:48:53,870 --> 00:48:56,113
I've been a good customer for 20 years.

867
00:48:59,060 --> 00:49:01,420
Yeah, well, I'm expecting
a residual checks soon

868
00:49:01,420 --> 00:49:03,330
and I'll send it in then.

869
00:49:03,330 --> 00:49:04,633
Hm, thanks.

870
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:08,683
So, I lied.

871
00:49:10,230 --> 00:49:11,740
- This must be tough.

872
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:13,630
- Yeah, well they always
wanna give you credit

873
00:49:13,630 --> 00:49:15,060
until you need it.
- Huh.

874
00:49:16,910 --> 00:49:18,663
- Okay, where were we?

875
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:24,700
- Rhodes recanted his
testimony three times.

876
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:28,000
He said he did it all, but it
didn't make any difference.

877
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,225
Didn't jive with ballistics
or the witness accounts.

878
00:49:31,225 --> 00:49:32,970
See, the bullet that hit the
police car definitely came

879
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:34,710
from the back of the Camaro

880
00:49:34,710 --> 00:49:38,733
and the truck driver, Hyman,
remembers Rhodes in front.

881
00:49:39,580 --> 00:49:43,840
- Yeah, but both truck
drivers clearly remember

882
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:46,560
seeing Jesse pinned on
the hood of the police car

883
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:48,160
when the first shots were fired.

884
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:51,470
- Yeah, so if Rhodes and
Jesse are both in front,

885
00:49:51,470 --> 00:49:52,900
who fired from the back?

886
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:54,900
- It wasn't Sunny.
- I know, I know, I know,

887
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:55,733
but who?

888
00:49:58,310 --> 00:49:59,520
- I don't know.

889
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:03,553
- I'm beat.

890
00:50:05,690 --> 00:50:07,853
I'm gonna hit the road.
- Okay.

891
00:50:09,253 --> 00:50:12,390
- You know, you oughta get some sleep too.

892
00:50:12,390 --> 00:50:13,223
- Yeah.

893
00:50:13,223 --> 00:50:17,433
Holly, what about Brenda Isham?

894
00:50:18,950 --> 00:50:20,550
- Nothing yet, Mick.

895
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:23,896
I'll check with our detective
again tomorrow, okay?

896
00:50:23,896 --> 00:50:26,336
Night.

897
00:50:26,336 --> 00:50:27,586
- Night, Holly.

898
00:50:48,117 --> 00:50:48,950
That's it.

899
00:50:51,830 --> 00:50:53,660
- Micki, what's wrong?

900
00:50:53,660 --> 00:50:56,160
- Jose, you're not gonna believe this.

901
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:58,353
I figured out what happened.

902
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:05,433
So, this is Hyman's truck parked here.

903
00:51:06,290 --> 00:51:08,530
Rhodes is standing at
the front of the Camaro

904
00:51:08,530 --> 00:51:10,390
before the shooting starts.

905
00:51:10,390 --> 00:51:12,300
Both the truck drivers see this

906
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:14,070
and see the cops subdue Jesse

907
00:51:14,070 --> 00:51:16,220
and slam him on the
hood of the police car.

908
00:51:17,260 --> 00:51:19,650
And then their testimony differs.

909
00:51:19,650 --> 00:51:22,990
McKenzie sees Trooper
Black make a radio call

910
00:51:22,990 --> 00:51:26,170
and sees Rhodes moved to
the back of the Camaro.

911
00:51:26,170 --> 00:51:28,240
But Hyman never sees any of this

912
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:30,973
because McKenzie's truck
blocks Hyman's view.

913
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:35,040
By the time McKenzie's truck clears Hyman,

914
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:37,240
the shooting starts and
Hyman is watching the action.

915
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:38,223
The cops falling.

916
00:51:39,060 --> 00:51:41,760
Now, it never registered in
Hyman's mind Rhode's moved

917
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:44,750
because he never saw it.

918
00:51:44,750 --> 00:51:46,780
- But there's still one problem.

919
00:51:46,780 --> 00:51:49,280
Ballistics show the shots
came from the back seat.

920
00:51:50,370 --> 00:51:52,540
They inserted a pole into the bullet hole

921
00:51:52,540 --> 00:51:54,240
that they found in the police car.

922
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:58,530
The trajectory pointed directly
to where Sunny was seated.

923
00:51:58,530 --> 00:52:00,873
- But Rhodes was the one who
drove the police car away

924
00:52:00,873 --> 00:52:01,706
from the scene,

925
00:52:01,706 --> 00:52:04,200
so they don't know exactly
where it was parked.

926
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:09,200
Now look, if you shift it, even a foot,

927
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:12,280
now the trajectory
points behind the Camaro

928
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:14,690
where Rhodes moved.

929
00:52:14,690 --> 00:52:17,840
At the trial, he swore
Sunny fired the gun,

930
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:19,343
then handed it to Jesse.

931
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:24,380
But Rhodes was the only one who
conclusively tested positive

932
00:52:24,380 --> 00:52:26,123
for firing a gun that day.

933
00:52:28,690 --> 00:52:32,283
- If you're right, it proves
that Sunny was innocent.

934
00:52:33,853 --> 00:52:35,403
- It proves Jesse was too.

935
00:52:46,333 --> 00:52:47,703
- How did you arrange this?

936
00:52:47,703 --> 00:52:48,620
- Jose did it.

937
00:52:48,620 --> 00:52:50,723
I am part of your defense team now.

938
00:52:50,723 --> 00:52:52,240
- Wow.

939
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:54,630
- That is not the best part.

940
00:52:54,630 --> 00:52:58,123
I figured out what happened that day.

941
00:53:10,837 --> 00:53:14,013
But Sunny, my theory proves
both of you were innocent.

942
00:53:15,210 --> 00:53:16,643
- No, you don't understand.

943
00:53:18,550 --> 00:53:20,487
Jesse always said that he didn't do it,

944
00:53:20,487 --> 00:53:22,113
but I never really knew.

945
00:53:23,526 --> 00:53:24,600
And I guess in the back of my mind,

946
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:27,300
I figured if he did do it that somehow

947
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:31,523
it justified me being
here all these years.

948
00:53:36,670 --> 00:53:39,120
- Sunny, I'm sorry, I thought in some way

949
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:40,350
this would make you happy.

950
00:53:40,350 --> 00:53:42,230
- Oh, it does.

951
00:53:42,230 --> 00:53:44,530
His mom will know and
Eric and Tina will know.

952
00:53:45,810 --> 00:53:47,763
I just wish I could tell him I'm sorry.

953
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:53,060
- Jose says it'll be hard to
get the graphics in the appeal.

954
00:53:53,060 --> 00:53:55,010
- Either way I win.

955
00:53:55,010 --> 00:53:55,843
- How's that?

956
00:53:57,230 --> 00:54:00,250
- You've shown me what it's
like to trust somebody again.

957
00:54:00,250 --> 00:54:01,403
Have somebody trust me.

958
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:05,930
- Great, we can exchange phone calls

959
00:54:05,930 --> 00:54:07,220
and letters and I can tell you

960
00:54:07,220 --> 00:54:08,779
what a great life you're missing.

961
00:54:08,779 --> 00:54:09,779
- Oh, Micki.

962
00:54:10,910 --> 00:54:11,773
I'll be fine.

963
00:54:12,810 --> 00:54:14,160
I'm more worried about you.

964
00:54:15,970 --> 00:54:18,260
I'm flying to Wyoming tomorrow.

965
00:54:18,260 --> 00:54:20,790
I've got a lead on Brenda Isham

966
00:54:20,790 --> 00:54:23,690
and then I'm going back to LA,
take care of some business.

967
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:28,333
What?

968
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:31,720
- I was just remembering that day

969
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:33,713
when you moved away with your parents.

970
00:54:35,220 --> 00:54:36,920
- Well, this time I'm coming back.

971
00:54:48,489 --> 00:54:51,406
(knuckles rapping)

972
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:54,560
Are you Brenda Isham?

973
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:55,867
- Yeah.

974
00:54:55,867 --> 00:54:59,163
- I'd like to talk to
you about Sonia Jacobs.

975
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:04,023
- I heard she was a cop killer.

976
00:55:04,980 --> 00:55:06,270
That she had gunned down those two men

977
00:55:06,270 --> 00:55:08,050
with her kids watching.

978
00:55:08,050 --> 00:55:09,580
- So, you lied.

979
00:55:09,580 --> 00:55:10,730
- It's not that simple.

980
00:55:12,110 --> 00:55:13,313
I was only a kid.

981
00:55:14,726 --> 00:55:17,160
They had an airtight case against me.

982
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:18,563
- Did they propose a deal?

983
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:22,210
- I was afraid that I would rot in jail

984
00:55:22,210 --> 00:55:24,853
for the next 10 years if
I didn't help them out

985
00:55:35,900 --> 00:55:37,123
I'm sorry.

986
00:55:38,050 --> 00:55:40,860
I didn't know what had
happened to her or to him.

987
00:55:40,860 --> 00:55:43,643
- If you're really sorry,
you'll come back and testify.

988
00:55:44,580 --> 00:55:46,200
- No, I can't go back there.

989
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:47,840
- Listen to me.

990
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:49,970
Two policemen are dead.

991
00:55:49,970 --> 00:55:52,920
A man has been executed
and two children grew up

992
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:54,450
without a mother or a father.

993
00:55:54,450 --> 00:55:56,810
No one can change that, Brenda.

994
00:55:56,810 --> 00:55:59,810
But, Sunny has been rotting
in a prison for 15 years

995
00:55:59,810 --> 00:56:01,950
for something she didn't do.

996
00:56:01,950 --> 00:56:03,630
You can change that.

997
00:56:03,630 --> 00:56:05,670
- I'll swear out a statement.

998
00:56:05,670 --> 00:56:07,970
I'll let you video tape
me, whatever you want.

999
00:56:12,212 --> 00:56:14,462
But, I can't go back there.

1000
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:23,990
- She felt threatened so
she lied to convict Sunny.

1001
00:56:23,990 --> 00:56:25,930
- Granted, but unless she
swears to it in court,

1002
00:56:25,930 --> 00:56:27,304
it does us no good.

1003
00:56:27,304 --> 00:56:28,370
- What about Rhodes?

1004
00:56:28,370 --> 00:56:31,630
He recanted on three separate
occasions for God sakes.

1005
00:56:31,630 --> 00:56:32,810
One of them was under oath.

1006
00:56:32,810 --> 00:56:35,080
He even admitted he lied
to the other prisoner.

1007
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:35,913
- Grow up, Micki.

1008
00:56:35,913 --> 00:56:38,090
Convicts change their
testimony with the weather.

1009
00:56:38,090 --> 00:56:39,830
- So, he lies when he takes it back,

1010
00:56:39,830 --> 00:56:42,200
but not when he points his
finger to save his own neck?

1011
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:44,280
- Unfortunately, yes.

1012
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:46,100
- Well, that should have at
least gotten them a new trial.

1013
00:56:46,100 --> 00:56:48,386
The only weapon Satz had was Rhodes.

1014
00:56:48,386 --> 00:56:49,740
- Okay, here it is.

1015
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:50,960
Complete with graphics.

1016
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:53,290
We're messengering it over to
the appellate court tomorrow.

1017
00:56:53,290 --> 00:56:55,483
This is our last chance for revisions.

1018
00:56:56,440 --> 00:56:58,190
- It'll be the last chance, period.

1019
00:57:00,530 --> 00:57:02,030
These are the graphics I used.

1020
00:57:02,990 --> 00:57:04,040
- It'd make a great segment,

1021
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:05,680
especially if you can get Brenda Isham.

1022
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:06,790
- I talked to her last night.

1023
00:57:06,790 --> 00:57:07,930
She said she'd do it.

1024
00:57:07,930 --> 00:57:09,880
- She'll face 20 million people on TV,

1025
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:11,500
but she won't face Michael Satz?

1026
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:12,333
- I know.

1027
00:57:13,690 --> 00:57:14,523
- Yeah.

1028
00:57:15,410 --> 00:57:16,243
Thanks.

1029
00:57:16,243 --> 00:57:18,053
Turn the TV on, channel seven.

1030
00:57:19,540 --> 00:57:20,500
- They've overturned her conviction,

1031
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:21,675
- [Reporter] Can you retry Sonia?

1032
00:57:21,675 --> 00:57:22,960
- [Reporter] What about Jesse Tafero?

1033
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:24,150
- [Reporter] Did Walter Rhodes lie?

1034
00:57:24,150 --> 00:57:26,181
- Walter Rhodes passed the polygraph test.

1035
00:57:26,181 --> 00:57:27,840
I wouldn't have made
the deal if he hadn't.

1036
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:31,180
Jesse Tafero was guilty, just
like Sonia Jacobs is guilty

1037
00:57:31,180 --> 00:57:33,130
and yes, we will retry her.

1038
00:57:33,130 --> 00:57:34,530
- [Reporter] Will you
cut a deal with Sonia?

1039
00:57:34,530 --> 00:57:35,363
- No deals.

1040
00:57:35,363 --> 00:57:36,817
Thank you, that's all.

1041
00:57:38,180 --> 00:57:40,610
- Jose, it's me.
- Micki, we've been trying

1042
00:57:40,610 --> 00:57:41,920
to reach you for hours.

1043
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:43,090
The appellate court overturned-

1044
00:57:43,090 --> 00:57:44,573
- It's on the news.

1045
00:57:44,573 --> 00:57:45,976
Does she know?

1046
00:57:45,976 --> 00:57:46,930
- [Jose] No, she's-

1047
00:57:46,930 --> 00:57:47,763
- Let me tell her.

1048
00:57:47,763 --> 00:57:49,620
I can make it to Broward in half an hour.

1049
00:57:49,620 --> 00:57:52,643
She's not at Broward, Sunny's missing.

1050
00:57:57,874 --> 00:58:00,624
(dramatic music)

1051
00:58:08,270 --> 00:58:09,570
- Where are you taking me?

1052
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:14,203
This isn't legal, I'm not
supposed to leave the prison.

1053
00:58:16,364 --> 00:58:19,114
(dramatic music)

1054
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:29,504
- Let's go, come on.

1055
00:58:29,504 --> 00:58:30,623
Move it.
- Where are you taking me?

1056
00:58:32,851 --> 00:58:35,601
(dramatic music)

1057
00:58:37,748 --> 00:58:38,898
- This is unbelievable.

1058
00:58:39,890 --> 00:58:42,140
I want her located and returned tonight.

1059
00:58:42,140 --> 00:58:45,690
- Look, we had the court
order to release her.

1060
00:58:45,690 --> 00:58:47,020
When her verdict was overturned,

1061
00:58:47,020 --> 00:58:50,410
she was given over to local
authorities to await retrial.

1062
00:58:50,410 --> 00:58:52,613
She's no longer the
state's responsibility.

1063
00:58:53,540 --> 00:58:55,010
There was nothing I could do.

1064
00:58:55,010 --> 00:58:56,240
- Sunny was afraid of this.

1065
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:57,953
That's why we filed the motion.

1066
00:58:58,840 --> 00:58:59,673
- What motion?

1067
00:58:59,673 --> 00:59:02,763
- We have a court order preventing
her removal or transfer.

1068
00:59:05,420 --> 00:59:07,963
- I'm sorry, but we never got it.

1069
00:59:10,340 --> 00:59:12,020
- We're gonna get her back

1070
00:59:12,020 --> 00:59:14,950
and if one hair on her head is harmed,

1071
00:59:14,950 --> 00:59:17,010
we're gonna file a lawsuit so big

1072
00:59:17,010 --> 00:59:18,563
that it's gonna sink the state.

1073
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:26,160
- I know it's late, but it's an emergency.

1074
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:27,600
Could you have judge Enriquez

1075
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:29,980
call Jose Quinones' office, please.

1076
00:59:29,980 --> 00:59:30,813
Thank you.

1077
00:59:30,813 --> 00:59:32,350
- What's the point of
getting a court order

1078
00:59:32,350 --> 00:59:34,250
if it's never delivered to the warden?

1079
00:59:35,310 --> 00:59:36,623
Yeah, well talk is cheap.

1080
00:59:37,580 --> 00:59:39,730
No, no, no, no, first
thing in the morning.

1081
00:59:40,576 --> 00:59:41,409
Okay.

1082
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:44,540
- Mm, talk is cheap, coming from a lawyer.

1083
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:46,703
- You a smart aleck.

1084
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:49,553
You're smiling.

1085
00:59:50,970 --> 00:59:53,250
- I've even been known
to laugh on occasion.

1086
00:59:53,250 --> 00:59:55,150
- Hell, well that I would have to see.

1087
00:59:56,310 --> 00:59:57,470
Why don't you go on.

1088
00:59:57,470 --> 00:59:59,063
I'll wait for the judge to call.

1089
01:00:00,977 --> 01:00:03,200
- I sent Christie a copy of the deposition

1090
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:04,410
and she faxed me back some notes

1091
01:00:04,410 --> 01:00:05,960
so I'd like to go through them.

1092
01:00:07,820 --> 01:00:09,770
- You know, Sunny is a very lucky lady.

1093
01:00:11,770 --> 01:00:13,120
- Yeah.

1094
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:14,773
She's led a charmed life.

1095
01:00:17,603 --> 01:00:19,570
(phone ringing)

1096
01:00:19,570 --> 01:00:20,403
- Hello?

1097
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:22,550
Judge.

1098
01:00:22,550 --> 01:00:26,217
(speaking foreign language)

1099
01:00:27,672 --> 01:00:28,505
Perfecto.

1100
01:00:29,435 --> 01:00:30,268
Uh-huh.

1101
01:00:30,268 --> 01:00:32,935
(intense music)

1102
01:00:36,482 --> 01:00:37,982
- Home sweet home.

1103
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:41,987
- Is that her?

1104
01:00:41,987 --> 01:00:43,237
- I don't know.

1105
01:00:44,458 --> 01:00:45,291
What do you think?

1106
01:00:45,291 --> 01:00:46,740
Do you see her?

1107
01:00:46,740 --> 01:00:47,573
- It's her.

1108
01:00:49,179 --> 01:00:51,357
- Sunny, Sunny!
- Hey!

1109
01:00:51,357 --> 01:00:54,274
(horn honking)
Hey!

1110
01:00:57,060 --> 01:00:58,760
Your honor, Sonia Jacobs has already spent

1111
01:00:58,760 --> 01:01:02,620
16 years behind bars for a
conviction which was overturned.

1112
01:01:02,620 --> 01:01:04,100
It would be an outrage to deny her

1113
01:01:04,100 --> 01:01:06,360
a reasonable bail pending a new trial.

1114
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:09,010
- Mr. Satz?
- Your honor,

1115
01:01:09,010 --> 01:01:10,860
the defendant is still
charged with the brutal murder

1116
01:01:10,860 --> 01:01:12,440
of two police officers.

1117
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:14,564
The people vehemently
oppose any bond request.

1118
01:01:14,564 --> 01:01:17,970
- Mr. Quinone, how's your
client gonna make bond?

1119
01:01:17,970 --> 01:01:20,790
- Your honor, I have a house in Boston

1120
01:01:20,790 --> 01:01:22,810
I'd be willing to put up as collateral

1121
01:01:22,810 --> 01:01:26,030
and I'd gladly take full
responsibility for Sunny,

1122
01:01:26,030 --> 01:01:27,343
I mean, Sonia.

1123
01:01:30,270 --> 01:01:33,130
- Your honor, since Mr.
Satz tried the original case

1124
01:01:33,130 --> 01:01:35,500
and we filed a motion to disqualify him,

1125
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:37,720
we feel he is unduly
prejudiced against our client.

1126
01:01:37,720 --> 01:01:39,320
- She is charged with murder, Your Honor,

1127
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:41,140
I wouldn't be doing my
job if I didn't seek

1128
01:01:41,140 --> 01:01:45,023
to keep her in custody and I
resent any other implication.

1129
01:01:46,230 --> 01:01:48,270
- Well, the nature of the
charges against the defendant

1130
01:01:48,270 --> 01:01:51,340
are such that I'm going
to deny the bond motion.

1131
01:01:51,340 --> 01:01:52,930
For the record, Mr. Quinone,

1132
01:01:52,930 --> 01:01:55,030
I've known Mr. Satz for 20 years.

1133
01:01:55,030 --> 01:01:56,950
I've always found his professional ethics

1134
01:01:56,950 --> 01:01:58,500
to be of the highest standards.

1135
01:01:59,810 --> 01:02:02,790
Next case.
(gavel rapping)

1136
01:02:02,790 --> 01:02:06,360
- What rock did Satz crawl out from under?

1137
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:07,610
- He's feeling the heat

1138
01:02:08,860 --> 01:02:10,610
and it could bite us in the ass.

1139
01:02:10,610 --> 01:02:13,290
He's got a re-convict her,
his career to be on the line.

1140
01:02:13,290 --> 01:02:14,640
- Holly's right.

1141
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:16,200
We're cornering him.

1142
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:17,300
- If we win,

1143
01:02:17,300 --> 01:02:19,400
you'll have to explain
why his star witness lied

1144
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:22,400
to get two convictions and why
an innocent man was executed.

1145
01:02:23,620 --> 01:02:26,570
- They could file a motion
to recuse the judge.

1146
01:02:26,570 --> 01:02:28,170
He and Satz are awful chummy.

1147
01:02:28,170 --> 01:02:29,010
- Keep the judge.

1148
01:02:29,010 --> 01:02:30,173
It won't matter anyway.

1149
01:02:31,090 --> 01:02:32,700
At least he's honest enough to admit it.

1150
01:02:32,700 --> 01:02:34,570
- But it could help them, Sunny.

1151
01:02:34,570 --> 01:02:36,040
It could be to their advantage.

1152
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:37,890
- They already have the advantage.

1153
01:02:37,890 --> 01:02:40,620
Why do you think I've spent
the last 16 years in prison?

1154
01:02:40,620 --> 01:02:42,170
They can do whatever they want.

1155
01:02:56,770 --> 01:02:58,770
- Coming back to the office?

1156
01:02:58,770 --> 01:03:01,120
- I've got something to
do, I'll see you later.

1157
01:03:04,156 --> 01:03:05,290
(knuckles rapping)

1158
01:03:05,290 --> 01:03:06,123
- Okay.

1159
01:03:09,345 --> 01:03:10,178
Let me help.

1160
01:03:10,178 --> 01:03:11,552
Put it in there.
- Yeah.

1161
01:03:11,552 --> 01:03:12,910
I've brought the last of your files back.

1162
01:03:12,910 --> 01:03:14,160
Hi Tina.

1163
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:16,350
- Oh, Tina's just going to
take out the wash for me.

1164
01:03:16,350 --> 01:03:20,679
- Oh, well listen, can I
give you any help here?

1165
01:03:20,679 --> 01:03:21,512
Let me get that.

1166
01:03:21,512 --> 01:03:22,800
All right.
- Thank you.

1167
01:03:31,380 --> 01:03:34,210
- They called us the
Siamese twins in camp.

1168
01:03:34,210 --> 01:03:36,100
Then I moved away and we lost touch.

1169
01:03:36,100 --> 01:03:37,970
- Yeah, I know the feeling.

1170
01:03:37,970 --> 01:03:39,460
- I know you've had it tough, Tina.

1171
01:03:39,460 --> 01:03:41,590
Must've been terrible
not having your parents,

1172
01:03:41,590 --> 01:03:43,910
but when she gets out-
- Cut the crap, okay?

1173
01:03:43,910 --> 01:03:45,410
I've heard it all my life.

1174
01:03:45,410 --> 01:03:48,810
I'll be home by your birthday,
by Christmas, by graduation.

1175
01:03:48,810 --> 01:03:50,140
It's all just a bunch of lies.

1176
01:03:50,140 --> 01:03:51,060
- She didn't lie, Tina.

1177
01:03:51,060 --> 01:03:52,130
She believed in the system.

1178
01:03:52,130 --> 01:03:53,410
- Yeah, right?

1179
01:03:53,410 --> 01:03:54,873
The truth will set me free, honey.

1180
01:03:54,873 --> 01:03:57,670
That was another one of
her favorite expressions.

1181
01:03:57,670 --> 01:03:59,980
So, I waited and waited and waited.

1182
01:03:59,980 --> 01:04:01,630
Well, I'm not waiting anymore.

1183
01:04:01,630 --> 01:04:04,490
- Look, she made some
mistakes, some big ones,

1184
01:04:04,490 --> 01:04:06,590
but it's not her fault it's taken so long.

1185
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:10,250
- People like you make me sick, you know?

1186
01:04:10,250 --> 01:04:13,310
With your perfect houses,
and perfect families,

1187
01:04:13,310 --> 01:04:15,230
and perfect mothers.

1188
01:04:15,230 --> 01:04:18,370
Well, my fairytale is a
little different, okay?

1189
01:04:18,370 --> 01:04:20,700
- Look, maybe you've had more

1190
01:04:20,700 --> 01:04:22,050
than your share of grief, Tina,

1191
01:04:22,050 --> 01:04:25,410
but look around, there
aren't any perfect families

1192
01:04:25,410 --> 01:04:26,810
in this world.

1193
01:04:26,810 --> 01:04:30,690
It takes lots of love and forgiveness

1194
01:04:30,690 --> 01:04:32,290
for any family to stay together.

1195
01:04:36,020 --> 01:04:37,163
- Well, I'm fresh out.

1196
01:04:38,286 --> 01:04:40,786
(light music)

1197
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:44,593
- Tina.

1198
01:04:46,890 --> 01:04:48,540
She's got enough for both of you.

1199
01:04:56,560 --> 01:04:57,443
- Hi, mom?

1200
01:05:02,490 --> 01:05:04,363
I was just thinking about you.

1201
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:11,173
No, no, nothing's wrong.

1202
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:17,840
- Maybe it's time to consider
an alternative theory.

1203
01:05:18,860 --> 01:05:20,320
Jesse's gone.

1204
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:23,100
We can't help him, but it might help Sunny

1205
01:05:23,100 --> 01:05:24,683
if we give him up as a shooter.

1206
01:05:26,550 --> 01:05:27,383
- If we do that,

1207
01:05:27,383 --> 01:05:29,720
then what's the difference
between them and us?

1208
01:05:31,620 --> 01:05:33,923
Besides, she'd never go for it.

1209
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:36,793
- Okay, it was a bad idea.

1210
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:39,340
- I don't think Satz is as confident

1211
01:05:39,340 --> 01:05:40,550
as he'd like us to believe.

1212
01:05:40,550 --> 01:05:42,100
He's gotta try to convict Sunny again

1213
01:05:42,100 --> 01:05:44,450
on a case that's 16 years old.

1214
01:05:44,450 --> 01:05:47,600
It's tough to do when your star
witnesses is Walter Rhodes.

1215
01:05:47,600 --> 01:05:50,000
How many times can he lie
without tripping himself up?

1216
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:53,450
- Satz cut a deal because
Rhodes passed the polygraph.

1217
01:05:53,450 --> 01:05:55,940
Has anyone actually seen that test?

1218
01:05:55,940 --> 01:05:58,160
I mean, we all know he
lied, so how did he pass it?

1219
01:05:58,160 --> 01:06:00,363
- The test wasn't used as evidence.

1220
01:06:01,490 --> 01:06:04,840
- Then why don't we get
our own expert to look at

1221
01:06:04,840 --> 01:06:06,462
and if we prove that he didn't pass it-

1222
01:06:06,462 --> 01:06:08,090
- Micki, I don't wanna do it now,

1223
01:06:08,090 --> 01:06:10,150
I wanna use it as ammo for the trial.

1224
01:06:10,150 --> 01:06:11,660
- I think you should do it now.

1225
01:06:11,660 --> 01:06:13,010
- Well thank you very
much for your opinion,

1226
01:06:13,010 --> 01:06:14,520
but Sunny's my client.

1227
01:06:14,520 --> 01:06:16,220
- Then why don't you represent her?

1228
01:06:16,220 --> 01:06:17,053
- You know what?

1229
01:06:17,053 --> 01:06:17,886
I think I've heard enough from you.

1230
01:06:17,886 --> 01:06:18,980
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1231
01:06:18,980 --> 01:06:20,300
- Well this is about Sunny's life

1232
01:06:20,300 --> 01:06:22,640
and it's not just about Sunny.

1233
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:24,330
It's the whole system is shot to hell

1234
01:06:24,330 --> 01:06:26,320
when it allows somebody like Walter Rhodes

1235
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:28,460
to barter his life for hers

1236
01:06:28,460 --> 01:06:31,690
with the same people who are
supposedly dispensing justice.

1237
01:06:31,690 --> 01:06:32,590
- Are you through?

1238
01:06:33,530 --> 01:06:36,353
- Not until you agree to
get the polygraph guy.

1239
01:06:42,690 --> 01:06:43,523
- All right.

1240
01:06:47,300 --> 01:06:48,133
- Good.

1241
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:55,850
- That woman is gonna
give me a heart attack.

1242
01:07:00,813 --> 01:07:04,110
(phone ringing)

1243
01:07:04,110 --> 01:07:05,100
- Hello?

1244
01:07:05,100 --> 01:07:07,090
- You want some good news?

1245
01:07:07,090 --> 01:07:09,050
- You heard from the polygraph guy?

1246
01:07:09,050 --> 01:07:11,180
- No, actually I was gonna
give you a tip on a horse race.

1247
01:07:11,180 --> 01:07:12,630
- Come on.

1248
01:07:12,630 --> 01:07:15,360
- The most bungled test he has ever seen.

1249
01:07:15,360 --> 01:07:17,720
We're going to depose the same guy

1250
01:07:17,720 --> 01:07:19,420
who gave Rhodes the original test.

1251
01:07:20,410 --> 01:07:22,700
- Oh, I wanna be there.

1252
01:07:22,700 --> 01:07:23,708
- All right.

1253
01:07:23,708 --> 01:07:24,541
But, you have to promise me

1254
01:07:24,541 --> 01:07:26,600
that you will keep your mouth shut.

1255
01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:30,257
- Oh, you know me? (laughing)

1256
01:07:30,257 --> 01:07:31,793
Yeah, bye.

1257
01:07:35,380 --> 01:07:36,213
Yes!

1258
01:07:46,350 --> 01:07:47,183
- Let's go.

1259
01:07:51,720 --> 01:07:53,917
- During the polygraph you asked Rhodes,

1260
01:07:53,917 --> 01:07:57,010
"Did you see Jesse shoot
both police officers?"

1261
01:07:57,010 --> 01:07:58,920
And in your report to Mr. Satz you wrote

1262
01:07:58,920 --> 01:08:00,860
that Rhodes responded, "Yes."

1263
01:08:00,860 --> 01:08:02,680
Correct?
- That's right.

1264
01:08:02,680 --> 01:08:05,550
- But if you look at the
actual polygraph chart,

1265
01:08:05,550 --> 01:08:08,190
you wrote that he responded, "No."

1266
01:08:08,190 --> 01:08:09,023
- Not exactly.

1267
01:08:10,650 --> 01:08:12,423
- This is your handwriting, isn't it?

1268
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:14,970
- Yes, but-

1269
01:08:14,970 --> 01:08:17,730
- Are saying that when you
wrote no, you really meant yes?

1270
01:08:17,730 --> 01:08:19,380
- No, that's not what I'm saying.

1271
01:08:22,113 --> 01:08:24,540
I must have changed the wording

1272
01:08:24,540 --> 01:08:27,343
on the questions or something.

1273
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:32,250
Okay, it was a long time ago.

1274
01:08:33,140 --> 01:08:34,340
I really don't remember.

1275
01:08:36,220 --> 01:08:38,640
- On page two of your reports,

1276
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:41,350
you wrote, "Rhodes says
he could not be sure

1277
01:08:41,350 --> 01:08:42,910
whether Sonia fired at all."

1278
01:08:44,530 --> 01:08:47,180
Yet he swore at the trial
Sonia fired the first shot.

1279
01:08:57,910 --> 01:08:59,357
- Let's go somewhere.

1280
01:09:01,550 --> 01:09:03,593
- Satz is running scared.

1281
01:09:05,110 --> 01:09:08,020
- Do you know when the
lion is most dangerous?

1282
01:09:08,020 --> 01:09:10,283
When he's injured or
his back is to the wall.

1283
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:13,290
Don't underestimate Satz

1284
01:09:13,290 --> 01:09:16,140
and don't fill Sunny's head
with promises you can't keep.

1285
01:09:18,449 --> 01:09:20,040
In the meantime, I
filed a discovery motion

1286
01:09:20,040 --> 01:09:22,690
for everything in Satz'
files with Rhodes' name on it

1287
01:09:24,068 --> 01:09:24,901
and I'm counting on you

1288
01:09:24,901 --> 01:09:26,090
to help me find something we can use.

1289
01:09:29,856 --> 01:09:31,506
Let's not keep his honor waiting.

1290
01:09:33,584 --> 01:09:36,138
(reporters yelling)

1291
01:09:36,138 --> 01:09:37,970
- I don't believe it, they
finally came to see you.

1292
01:09:37,970 --> 01:09:39,733
- [Sunny] I think they came for you.

1293
01:09:44,015 --> 01:09:45,320
- Mr. Quinone.

1294
01:09:45,320 --> 01:09:47,450
- Your honor, we call
Walter Rhodes to the stand

1295
01:09:47,450 --> 01:09:48,630
and I'd like your permission to treat him

1296
01:09:48,630 --> 01:09:49,950
as a hostile witness.

1297
01:09:49,950 --> 01:09:51,950
- Objection.
- Gentlemen,

1298
01:09:51,950 --> 01:09:53,490
this is not a trial.

1299
01:09:53,490 --> 01:09:55,850
It's merely a hearing to
determine whether or not Mr. Satz

1300
01:09:55,850 --> 01:09:58,970
should be disqualified as
the prosecutor for this case.

1301
01:09:58,970 --> 01:10:00,810
So, I'm going to allow some latitude

1302
01:10:00,810 --> 01:10:02,263
in questioning the witnesses.

1303
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:04,960
- Thank you, Your Honor.

1304
01:10:06,610 --> 01:10:11,500
In 1977, and 1979, and again in 1982,

1305
01:10:12,520 --> 01:10:14,350
you recanted your original testimony

1306
01:10:14,350 --> 01:10:16,620
that Sonia and Jesse Tafero
had shot the two officers.

1307
01:10:16,620 --> 01:10:17,740
Is that correct?

1308
01:10:17,740 --> 01:10:19,443
- I only recanted in 1982.

1309
01:10:21,100 --> 01:10:23,083
- Didn't you say under oath,

1310
01:10:24,067 --> 01:10:25,750
"I put two people on death row

1311
01:10:25,750 --> 01:10:29,170
for something that they
didn't do, that I did."

1312
01:10:29,170 --> 01:10:30,370
- That's right.

1313
01:10:30,370 --> 01:10:31,203
- But today you're saying

1314
01:10:31,203 --> 01:10:32,880
that those recantations were all lies,

1315
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:34,660
that you stand by your original testimony.

1316
01:10:34,660 --> 01:10:35,493
- Yeah.

1317
01:10:36,340 --> 01:10:39,000
- What was the reason for
recanting your testimony?

1318
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:40,520
- I wanted to get back at them.

1319
01:10:40,520 --> 01:10:41,570
Give 'em a hard time.

1320
01:10:42,550 --> 01:10:44,070
- And who is them?

1321
01:10:44,070 --> 01:10:46,623
- The DA's office, that bunch.

1322
01:10:48,660 --> 01:10:49,910
- And you wanted to give them a hard time

1323
01:10:49,910 --> 01:10:53,180
because they weren't
helping you get your parole

1324
01:10:53,180 --> 01:10:54,590
so you can get better work assignments,

1325
01:10:54,590 --> 01:10:56,140
privileges, that sort of thing.

1326
01:10:57,260 --> 01:10:58,840
- That's right.

1327
01:10:58,840 --> 01:11:00,650
- And did you get what you wanted?

1328
01:11:00,650 --> 01:11:01,483
- Usually.

1329
01:11:02,530 --> 01:11:05,110
- So, you'll say whatever it
takes to get what you want.

1330
01:11:05,110 --> 01:11:06,770
Including lying to help Mr. Satz

1331
01:11:06,770 --> 01:11:09,690
get death penalty convictions
on Sonia and Jesse.

1332
01:11:09,690 --> 01:11:10,740
- Is that a question?

1333
01:11:11,580 --> 01:11:12,453
- Not in my mind.

1334
01:11:20,676 --> 01:11:22,814
- [Man] Attention on the compound,

1335
01:11:22,814 --> 01:11:25,890
there will be no mail
or canteen this evening.

1336
01:11:25,890 --> 01:11:28,359
- So, you never told me how it went.

1337
01:11:28,359 --> 01:11:29,192
- It went okay, I guess.

1338
01:11:29,192 --> 01:11:30,188
- Then how come you look like the kid

1339
01:11:30,188 --> 01:11:32,070
who didn't get nothing for Christmas?

1340
01:11:32,070 --> 01:11:33,620
- I don't know.

1341
01:11:33,620 --> 01:11:35,380
I guess the closer I
get to the front door,

1342
01:11:35,380 --> 01:11:39,180
the more I'm afraid
something's gonna screw up.

1343
01:11:39,180 --> 01:11:41,570
- Hey, you gotta keep your head up.

1344
01:11:41,570 --> 01:11:43,130
Think positive.

1345
01:11:43,130 --> 01:11:45,220
Let your light shine, girl.

1346
01:11:45,220 --> 01:11:46,090
In other words,

1347
01:11:46,090 --> 01:11:48,614
you gotta do all this stuff
you keep telling me to do.

1348
01:11:48,614 --> 01:11:53,614
You're gonna be fine.

1349
01:11:59,400 --> 01:12:02,963
(speaking foreign language)

1350
01:12:02,963 --> 01:12:04,613
- Hey, we went ahead and ordered.

1351
01:12:05,450 --> 01:12:08,380
- Remember the 1977
confession that Rhodes made

1352
01:12:08,380 --> 01:12:10,760
to another inmate that he was the shooter?

1353
01:12:10,760 --> 01:12:12,380
- Convict testimony, it's worthless.

1354
01:12:12,380 --> 01:12:14,250
- Yeah, but there was a guard

1355
01:12:14,250 --> 01:12:16,250
who may have overheard the conversation.

1356
01:12:17,420 --> 01:12:19,520
It was buried in that last batch of files.

1357
01:12:24,530 --> 01:12:26,063
- This is suppressed evidence.

1358
01:12:27,100 --> 01:12:28,430
If Jesse's attorneys had seen this,

1359
01:12:28,430 --> 01:12:29,980
they could have saved his life.

1360
01:12:33,620 --> 01:12:35,430
I'm gonna rub this in Satz' face.

1361
01:12:35,430 --> 01:12:37,074
- Good.

1362
01:12:37,074 --> 01:12:39,330
I want everyone to know
those bastards didn't

1363
01:12:39,330 --> 01:12:42,103
just cross the line,
they tried to erase it.

1364
01:12:45,220 --> 01:12:47,630
- If Walter Rhodes had
failed his polygraph test,

1365
01:12:47,630 --> 01:12:49,130
would you have made a
plea bargain with him?

1366
01:12:49,130 --> 01:12:50,510
- Of course not.

1367
01:12:50,510 --> 01:12:52,340
- And yet to report of this test,

1368
01:12:52,340 --> 01:12:54,390
which you deemed so important,

1369
01:12:54,390 --> 01:12:56,760
was never provided to
Sonia Jacob's attorney.

1370
01:12:56,760 --> 01:12:58,150
- It wasn't a verbatim statement,

1371
01:12:58,150 --> 01:13:01,050
so I didn't feel it was
necessary to hand it over.

1372
01:13:01,050 --> 01:13:02,910
The state Supreme Court agreed with me.

1373
01:13:02,910 --> 01:13:04,640
- But, the 11th circuit
overturned the conviction,

1374
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:06,260
based on that, didn't they?

1375
01:13:06,260 --> 01:13:08,150
- If I had thought it was
going to be an appellate point,

1376
01:13:08,150 --> 01:13:10,260
I would have handed it over.

1377
01:13:10,260 --> 01:13:12,503
- Well, that's certainly
a new legal standard.

1378
01:13:15,240 --> 01:13:19,280
Weren't you fearful that even
the most incompetent lawyer

1379
01:13:19,280 --> 01:13:20,977
would have used Rhodes' statement,

1380
01:13:20,977 --> 01:13:23,380
"I don't know if Sonia fired at all,"

1381
01:13:23,380 --> 01:13:25,390
to prove that he'd lied on the polygraph?

1382
01:13:25,390 --> 01:13:27,710
- Polygraph results or
subjective counselor.

1383
01:13:27,710 --> 01:13:28,810
That's why they're in admissible.

1384
01:13:28,810 --> 01:13:29,650
You should know that.

1385
01:13:29,650 --> 01:13:31,890
- But, you put a lot of stock in them.

1386
01:13:31,890 --> 01:13:33,100
You made a deal that resulted

1387
01:13:33,100 --> 01:13:35,280
in the execution of Jesse Tafero

1388
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:37,150
and life in prison for Sonia Jacobs,

1389
01:13:37,150 --> 01:13:39,040
based on Walter Rhodes' polygraph.

1390
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:41,520
- I relied on the analysis given to me

1391
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:44,930
and that indicated that Mr.
Rhodes was telling the truth.

1392
01:13:44,930 --> 01:13:47,070
- Apparently the truth
can be a subjective thing

1393
01:13:47,070 --> 01:13:49,143
in the hands of your polygraph expert.

1394
01:13:51,730 --> 01:13:53,380
Tell me one more thing, Mr. Satz.

1395
01:13:54,280 --> 01:13:56,710
Didn't you think it was unethical

1396
01:13:56,710 --> 01:13:58,410
to hire Rhodes' public defender,

1397
01:13:58,410 --> 01:14:00,460
the same man that you made a deal with,

1398
01:14:00,460 --> 01:14:02,347
to be your chief assistant
shortly after the trial?

1399
01:14:02,347 --> 01:14:03,840
- No, I had known the man for years

1400
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:05,270
and thought he was a terrific lawyer.

1401
01:14:05,270 --> 01:14:07,010
- Did the paraffin test
indicating that Rhodes

1402
01:14:07,010 --> 01:14:10,140
was the only one who had
definitely fired a gun concern you?

1403
01:14:10,140 --> 01:14:11,840
- Those tests were inconclusive.

1404
01:14:11,840 --> 01:14:14,570
- What about the fact that
Rhodes drove the getaway car,

1405
01:14:14,570 --> 01:14:16,723
initiated the kidnapping of Mr. Levington?

1406
01:14:18,680 --> 01:14:20,713
- Which question would
you like me to answer?

1407
01:14:22,710 --> 01:14:23,693
- Answer me this.

1408
01:14:26,786 --> 01:14:28,413
Do you recall seeing this document?

1409
01:14:31,060 --> 01:14:33,470
It's a deposition from Henry Claycomb,

1410
01:14:33,470 --> 01:14:35,900
a prison guard who overheard
Rhodes tell another inmate

1411
01:14:35,900 --> 01:14:37,613
that he was the shooter.

1412
01:14:46,915 --> 01:14:48,020
- I don't recall.

1413
01:14:48,020 --> 01:14:50,910
- This document was in
your files, Mr. Satz.

1414
01:14:50,910 --> 01:14:53,020
I'll tell you for sure
who didn't see this,

1415
01:14:53,020 --> 01:14:54,893
Jesse Tefaro's lawyers.

1416
01:14:56,450 --> 01:14:57,490
Now, if you were representing him,

1417
01:14:57,490 --> 01:14:59,323
wouldn't you have wanted this information?

1418
01:15:01,270 --> 01:15:05,123
- Yes, I suppose I would.
(people mumbling)

1419
01:15:09,500 --> 01:15:10,640
- Did the fact that you were running

1420
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:12,540
for state attorney's office at the time,

1421
01:15:12,540 --> 01:15:15,810
have any bearing on your actions
on this high profile case?

1422
01:15:15,810 --> 01:15:19,050
- I ran on my record, not this trial.

1423
01:15:19,050 --> 01:15:20,800
- No further questions, Your Honor.

1424
01:15:30,310 --> 01:15:33,308
- I've waited years to see
that man break a sweat.

1425
01:15:33,308 --> 01:15:34,141
- Yes!

1426
01:15:36,170 --> 01:15:37,910
- Satz has offered a deal.

1427
01:15:37,910 --> 01:15:39,920
- I knew it.
- What's The deal?

1428
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:42,300
- He'll promise not to retry you,

1429
01:15:42,300 --> 01:15:43,760
but you have to take the stand and swear

1430
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:45,680
that Rhodes didn't pull the trigger.

1431
01:15:45,680 --> 01:15:47,100
Satz says if you agree to the deal,

1432
01:15:47,100 --> 01:15:48,950
you could be eating a
steak dinner tonight.

1433
01:15:48,950 --> 01:15:51,230
- That's the same as saying
Jesse and I killed those men.

1434
01:15:51,230 --> 01:15:52,710
- I pushed him hard today.

1435
01:15:52,710 --> 01:15:54,690
He'll look like a fool
if he let's you walk.

1436
01:15:54,690 --> 01:15:57,970
- You didn't do anything but
expose what really happened.

1437
01:15:57,970 --> 01:15:59,213
We can't let Satz do this.

1438
01:15:59,213 --> 01:16:00,793
- This is Sunny's decision.

1439
01:16:04,030 --> 01:16:05,130
It's a one-time offer.

1440
01:16:06,070 --> 01:16:09,170
I want you to think about
this very carefully.

1441
01:16:09,170 --> 01:16:10,710
- Sunny, Jose's right.

1442
01:16:10,710 --> 01:16:12,460
Another trial could drag on forever

1443
01:16:13,713 --> 01:16:14,963
and you could still lose.

1444
01:16:16,475 --> 01:16:19,225
(dramatic music)

1445
01:16:21,650 --> 01:16:25,330
- Tell Mr. Satz I'm a
vegetarian, I don't eat steak.

1446
01:16:25,330 --> 01:16:27,817
I will not confess to
something I didn't do

1447
01:16:27,817 --> 01:16:29,803
and I will never betray Jesse.

1448
01:16:38,850 --> 01:16:41,123
- Maybe you should reconsider Satz deal.

1449
01:16:42,830 --> 01:16:44,423
- Did Jose put you up to this?

1450
01:16:45,790 --> 01:16:48,440
- He's worried, he thinks
it may be your only chance.

1451
01:16:49,351 --> 01:16:51,090
- What kind of a chance is that, Micki?

1452
01:16:51,090 --> 01:16:53,010
A chance to say that we were murderers

1453
01:16:53,010 --> 01:16:55,190
and that Jesse deserved to die?

1454
01:16:55,190 --> 01:16:56,653
I'd rather face a new jury.

1455
01:17:02,300 --> 01:17:04,100
Do you think I should take the deal?

1456
01:17:05,190 --> 01:17:07,300
- I can't tell you what to do.

1457
01:17:07,300 --> 01:17:08,173
Nobody can.

1458
01:17:09,090 --> 01:17:10,720
- Micki, would you take the deal?

1459
01:17:10,720 --> 01:17:12,643
- Don't ask me that, Sunny.

1460
01:17:18,090 --> 01:17:19,370
- There was a time

1461
01:17:19,370 --> 01:17:21,470
when I would've taken this deal, any deal?

1462
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:23,650
But, not anymore.

1463
01:17:25,210 --> 01:17:27,813
They may have my body, but not my soul.

1464
01:17:31,730 --> 01:17:32,563
I'll be fine.

1465
01:17:36,622 --> 01:17:39,289
(phone ringing)

1466
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:43,440
- Hello.

1467
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:45,430
- Satz wants to meet at
the courthouse first thing

1468
01:17:45,430 --> 01:17:46,340
in the morning.

1469
01:17:46,340 --> 01:17:48,160
- Is he gonna offer a new deal?

1470
01:17:48,160 --> 01:17:50,290
- That'd be my guess.

1471
01:17:50,290 --> 01:17:51,820
You're the only one I've called.

1472
01:17:51,820 --> 01:17:54,380
So, please keep this to yourself.

1473
01:17:54,380 --> 01:17:55,603
- Yeah, sure.

1474
01:17:56,530 --> 01:17:57,830
- [Jose] See you in court.

1475
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:03,540
- I just get so nervous
at those parole hearings.

1476
01:18:03,540 --> 01:18:05,420
- I'm gonna coach you this time.

1477
01:18:05,420 --> 01:18:07,780
Remember how I got Nelly
out two years early?

1478
01:18:07,780 --> 01:18:09,350
All right, come Mother's
Day you're gonna be home

1479
01:18:09,350 --> 01:18:11,133
with your kids where you belong.

1480
01:18:14,102 --> 01:18:15,330
- We got a transfer order on you.

1481
01:18:15,330 --> 01:18:17,540
- Where?
- Courthouse.

1482
01:18:17,540 --> 01:18:18,940
- Come on.

1483
01:18:18,940 --> 01:18:20,190
They don't drag it down to the courthouse

1484
01:18:20,190 --> 01:18:21,760
this late on Friday for nothing.

1485
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:22,593
Get going!

1486
01:18:31,022 --> 01:18:32,355
- [Woman] You go girl, you go.

1487
01:18:32,355 --> 01:18:33,768
- [Woman] Go Sunny, we're praying for you.

1488
01:18:33,768 --> 01:18:34,960
- [Woman] Good luck, honey.

1489
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:36,310
- [Woman] Good luck, Sunny.

1490
01:18:37,267 --> 01:18:38,567
- [Woman] Go to it, Sunny.

1491
01:18:45,710 --> 01:18:48,630
- Hi.
- I can't believe you made it.

1492
01:18:48,630 --> 01:18:49,463
- Oh, me neither.

1493
01:18:49,463 --> 01:18:52,003
They were closing the doors
of the plane when I got on.

1494
01:18:54,120 --> 01:18:55,480
- Hey, did you reach Tina.

1495
01:18:55,480 --> 01:18:56,823
- Nah, I left a message.

1496
01:18:58,830 --> 01:19:01,070
- Hi, thanks for coming down.

1497
01:19:01,070 --> 01:19:02,810
- Well, I hope they let her go.

1498
01:19:02,810 --> 01:19:04,410
- Me too.

1499
01:19:04,410 --> 01:19:05,790
- You should've heard
your father last night,

1500
01:19:05,790 --> 01:19:07,920
bragging about you to
anybody who would listen.

1501
01:19:07,920 --> 01:19:09,250
- You were?

1502
01:19:09,250 --> 01:19:11,700
- To tell the truth, I
was bragging a little too.

1503
01:19:13,510 --> 01:19:14,343
- Thanks, mom.

1504
01:19:18,249 --> 01:19:19,210
Jose, where's Sunny?

1505
01:19:19,210 --> 01:19:20,130
- I'm going up now.

1506
01:19:20,130 --> 01:19:20,963
- Not without me.

1507
01:19:20,963 --> 01:19:22,320
- You say nothing that will influence her,

1508
01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:23,557
you understand me?

1509
01:19:23,557 --> 01:19:25,307
You sure know how to keep a secret.

1510
01:19:28,310 --> 01:19:29,680
It's called the Alfred Plea.

1511
01:19:29,680 --> 01:19:30,540
It's not used much,

1512
01:19:30,540 --> 01:19:31,470
but basically what it means

1513
01:19:31,470 --> 01:19:33,270
is that you maintain your innocence,

1514
01:19:33,270 --> 01:19:34,991
charges against you will be read in court,

1515
01:19:34,991 --> 01:19:36,691
and you agree not to contest them.

1516
01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:39,033
- And that's it?

1517
01:19:39,033 --> 01:19:40,290
I go free?

1518
01:19:40,290 --> 01:19:41,880
- This way Satz is protected.

1519
01:19:41,880 --> 01:19:43,430
You can't sue him or the state.

1520
01:19:44,500 --> 01:19:47,100
- Money and liability,
that's all it's about.

1521
01:19:47,100 --> 01:19:49,013
- It's the best he'll ever offer.

1522
01:19:49,960 --> 01:19:51,173
- [Micki] It's up to you.

1523
01:19:58,354 --> 01:20:01,104
(dramatic music)

1524
01:20:02,718 --> 01:20:04,960
- I've been here a long time.

1525
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:07,020
I wanna see my kids.

1526
01:20:07,020 --> 01:20:08,970
I wanna watch my granddaughter grow up.

1527
01:20:12,112 --> 01:20:13,100
I don't have to say anything?

1528
01:20:13,100 --> 01:20:14,150
No lies?

1529
01:20:14,150 --> 01:20:14,983
- No.

1530
01:20:17,490 --> 01:20:19,263
- Then tell Satz I'll take the deal.

1531
01:20:23,120 --> 01:20:24,570
- Listen to me Sunny,

1532
01:20:24,570 --> 01:20:26,710
this whole deal hangs on your silence.

1533
01:20:26,710 --> 01:20:29,500
If you say anything,
anything that refutes Satz,

1534
01:20:29,500 --> 01:20:30,800
the whole deal could blow?

1535
01:20:36,543 --> 01:20:39,460
(triumphant music)

1536
01:20:51,080 --> 01:20:52,580
- All right, shall we proceed?

1537
01:20:53,490 --> 01:20:56,600
Sonia Jacobs, you're charged
with two counts of murder.

1538
01:20:56,600 --> 01:21:01,060
- Your honor, may I have a glass of water?

1539
01:21:01,060 --> 01:21:02,913
I have a very bad taste in my mouth.

1540
01:21:15,740 --> 01:21:16,573
Thank you.

1541
01:21:19,490 --> 01:21:20,670
- All right.

1542
01:21:20,670 --> 01:21:22,040
Sonia Jacobs, our records show

1543
01:21:22,040 --> 01:21:23,520
that you have served 16 years,

1544
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:26,890
233 days of your original sentence.

1545
01:21:26,890 --> 01:21:27,723
- Sounds right.

1546
01:21:28,593 --> 01:21:30,953
- Well, then I order you
freed for time served.

1547
01:21:30,953 --> 01:21:34,140
(people celebrating)

1548
01:21:34,140 --> 01:21:36,743
- [Officer] No physical
contact till she's processed.

1549
01:21:39,321 --> 01:21:41,904
(upbeat music)

1550
01:21:53,257 --> 01:21:56,257
(reporters yelling)

1551
01:22:00,708 --> 01:22:02,027
- [Reporter] What made
you change your mind?

1552
01:22:02,027 --> 01:22:05,470
- Was Sonia Jacobs innocent, Mr. Satz?

1553
01:22:05,470 --> 01:22:07,590
- Listen everybody, it'll be awhile

1554
01:22:07,590 --> 01:22:08,523
before she's processed out.

1555
01:22:08,523 --> 01:22:10,320
There's a pub down the street, we can all-

1556
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:11,866
- My treat.

1557
01:22:11,866 --> 01:22:14,543
Let's make it champagne.

1558
01:22:14,543 --> 01:22:18,126
- You guys go on ahead,
I'll see you later.

1559
01:22:48,310 --> 01:22:51,793
- Almost half my life
and this is all there is.

1560
01:22:55,460 --> 01:22:56,293
You keep it.

1561
01:23:11,110 --> 01:23:14,163
- Hi, I was told Sonia Jacobs
would be released here.

1562
01:23:17,721 --> 01:23:19,567
- [Man] Beautiful day isn't it, Chris?

1563
01:23:20,490 --> 01:23:21,910
- I got a thing at my
kids' school tomorrow.

1564
01:23:21,910 --> 01:23:23,148
Cover my shift for me?

1565
01:23:23,148 --> 01:23:25,231
- No problem.
- Thank you.

1566
01:23:37,047 --> 01:23:39,047
- I picked this for you.

1567
01:23:40,576 --> 01:23:43,826
- Well, someone must know where she is.

1568
01:23:45,090 --> 01:23:46,588
(knuckles rapping)

1569
01:23:46,588 --> 01:23:47,421
Micki!

1570
01:23:50,861 --> 01:23:51,701
(light music)

1571
01:23:51,701 --> 01:23:54,118
I'm not coming back in there.

1572
01:23:58,262 --> 01:24:00,929
(upbeat music)
