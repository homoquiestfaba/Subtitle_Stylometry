1
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,500
Last orders, please.

2
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
- Shaun.
- Yeah?

3
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,300
- Do you see what I'm saying?
- Yeah, totally.

4
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,100
I know he's your best friend
but you do live with him.

5
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,665
I know...

6
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:56,300
It's not that I don't like Ed.
Ed, it's not that I don't like you.

7
00:00:56,335 --> 00:00:58,665
It's all right.

8
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:01,900
- It'd just be nice if we could...
- Fuck.

9
00:01:01,935 --> 00:01:05,100
...spend a bit more time together.
- Bollocks.

10
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,200
- Just the two of us.
- Cock it.

11
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:10,700
With Ed here, it's no wonder
I always bring my flatmates out

12
00:01:10,735 --> 00:01:12,800
and that only exacerbates things.

13
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:16,900
- What do you mean?
- You guys hardly get on, do you?

14
00:01:16,935 --> 00:01:18,917
No, what does "exacerbate" mean?

15
00:01:18,952 --> 00:01:20,900
It means to make things worse.

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,965
Right, right.

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,700
Well, I mean, it's not that
I don't like David and Di, you know.

18
00:01:26,735 --> 00:01:30,300
- Guys, it's not that I don't like you.
- It's all right.

19
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,500
And I do want to spend time with you.

20
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,500
It's just Ed doesn't have too many friends.

21
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,000
Can I get any of you cunts a drink?

22
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,800
Anybody?

23
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,300
No, thank you.

24
00:01:45,335 --> 00:01:47,500
I know...

25
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,665
friends are important to Shaun

26
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:52,900
but you must set some
quality time aside for yourselves.

27
00:01:52,935 --> 00:01:56,100
Daffs is always taking me
to see these listed buildings

28
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,600
and I'm always dragging him to the theatre.

29
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:01,500
- I'm not so hot on theatre.
- How about a meal?

30
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,500
- It's your anniversary soon.
- It was last week.

31
00:02:04,535 --> 00:02:07,400
- Did you do anything special?
- We came here.

32
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,600
Shaun. Hog lumps.

33
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:13,000
Shaun, what I'm trying to say is
I need something more,

34
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:16,600
more than spending every night
in the Winchester.

35
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:19,950
I want to do more interesting stuff.

36
00:02:19,985 --> 00:02:23,165
I want you to want to want to do it.

37
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,300
Listen to me.
I'm beginning to sound like your mum.

38
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,100
- Not that I'd know.
- You haven't met his mum?

39
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,000
- Not yet.
- Don't you get along with your mum?

40
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:35,500
- It's not her...
- Are you ashamed by your mum, Shaun?

41
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,800
- No, I love my mum.
- I love his mum.

42
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:40,065
Ed!

43
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,265
- Shaun!
- Liz.

44
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:45,400
I understand what
you're trying to say and I agree.

45
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,965
We should get out there.
We'll start tomorrow.

46
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,300
I'll book a restaurant.
The place that does all the fish.

47
00:02:51,335 --> 00:02:53,200
Just the two of us.

48
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:56,100
Things will change. I promise.

49
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,000
Really, Shaun?

50
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,000
Time, gentlemen.

51
00:03:02,035 --> 00:03:05,600
Shaun?

52
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,100
"Player two has entered the game."

53
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,365
Haven't you got work?

54
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,100
"Player two has left the game."

55
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,700
The front door was open again last night.

56
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,800
- I'm not saying it was you.
- I know, man.

57
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,500
- I'm saying it was Ed.
- Right.

58
00:04:40,535 --> 00:04:42,500
I can't live like this.

59
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:46,300
Look at the state of it.
We're not students any more.

60
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,300
- Pete...
- He brings no money into the house.

61
00:04:49,335 --> 00:04:52,165
- He brings a bit.
- What? Dealing drugs?

62
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,300
He sells a bit of weed now and again.
You've sold puff.

63
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:58,100
Yeah, once. At college. To you.

64
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:02,900
I've known him since primary school.
I like having him around, he's a laugh.

65
00:05:02,935 --> 00:05:05,567
Because he can
impersonate an orang-utan?

66
00:05:05,602 --> 00:05:08,351
- Fuck-a-doodle-doo.
- Leave him alone.

67
00:05:08,386 --> 00:05:11,065
I admit, he can be pretty funny on occasion.

68
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:15,700
Like that time we stayed up all night drinking
apple schnapps and playing Tekken 2.

69
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,500
- When was that?
- Five years ago.

70
00:05:19,535 --> 00:05:21,700
When's he going home?

71
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:25,265
Hey, man, listen... Top left.

72
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,800
- Uh-huh.
- I was gonna say... Reload.

73
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:31,000
- I'm on it.
- Erm, since... Nice shot!

74
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:33,000
Thanks.

75
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,865
Two seconds.

76
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:38,250
- All right, Noodle?
- "Got anything?"

77
00:05:38,285 --> 00:05:40,600
- No, man.
- "Eball says you was holding."

78
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:43,000
- I ain't got nothing.
- "Nothing at all?"

79
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:46,400
I've only got an 'enry meself.
All right, laters.

80
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,300
- Listen...
- Ed...

81
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,800
since you're not working at the moment
could you please clean up a bit?

82
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:58,700
And if you play the answer machine,
can you take down everyone's messages?

83
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,400
- Yep.
- It's not that taxing, is it?

84
00:06:01,435 --> 00:06:04,000
Writing something
on a scrap of paper?

85
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,300
- Nope.
- Right.

86
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:10,865
Dom, hi...

87
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:13,165
Come on, it was pretty funny.

88
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,800
- Will you do what he said?
- I ain't doing nothing for him.

89
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:18,800
Do it for me, then.

90
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,465
I'm sorry, Shaun.

91
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,700
- It's all right.
- No, no.

92
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,800
I'm sorry, Shaun.

93
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,765
Oh!

94
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,900
Oh, my God, that's rotten.

95
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,400
- I'll stop doing 'em when you stop laughing.
- I am not laughing.

96
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,300
- Get that.
- You get it.

97
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,265
"Shaun, it's me.
I'm gonna be a bit tied up today

98
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:47,400
"so can you book the table
for eight rather than seven?

99
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,500
"I'll try you at work. Bye, bye."

100
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,600
Hey! You're dead.

101
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
- Spare some change, please, mister?
- Yeah.

102
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:10,500
Watch out. Are you blind?

103
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:24,365
"The American
deep space probe Omega 6

104
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,500
"unexpectedly re-entered
Earth's atmosphere over England

105
00:07:28,535 --> 00:07:30,500
"and broke apart over..."

106
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,000
Nelson?

107
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:50,900
Nelson?

108
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,700
Hello, my friend. No beer today?

109
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,900
No, it's a bit early for me.

110
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:12,200
Gather round, everyone.
Gather round, please.

111
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,765
Gather round.

112
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,265
As well as Mr Sloman being off today

113
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:20,100
I'm afraid Ash is feeling
a little bit under the weather,

114
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,500
so I will be taking charge as the...

115
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,550
- Oldest.
- Senior staff member.

116
00:08:25,585 --> 00:08:28,500
So if we can all pull together...

117
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,100
- Hello? Hello, mate.
- Noel?

118
00:08:32,135 --> 00:08:34,565
I was totally munted last night.

119
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,700
Yeah, I spoke to him. He's only got Henry.

120
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:41,300
All right, mate. Laters.

121
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,865
- Continue.
- Thank you.

122
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:57,400
Erm, as Mr Sloman always says,
there's no I in team but there is an I in pie.

123
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,765
In... There's an I in meat pie.

124
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:03,300
The anagram of meat is team...
I don't know what he's talking about.

125
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,665
Phones off. It's not a social gathering.

126
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:10,300
- All right, keep your hair on, grandad.
- Hey! I'm 29 for Christ's sakes.

127
00:09:10,335 --> 00:09:12,800
- How old are you? 20? 21?
- 17.

128
00:09:12,835 --> 00:09:15,000
Hey, well...

129
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:19,800
I know you don't wanna be here forever.
I got things I wanna do with my life.

130
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:22,300
When?

131
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,600
You got red on you.

132
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,800
Hello, mate.

133
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:31,865
This one comes with
a basic digital package.

134
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:35,800
You've got your lifestyle channels there,
a bit of Trisha.

135
00:09:35,835 --> 00:09:39,700
Er, you've got entertainment.
I don't know what that is.

136
00:09:39,735 --> 00:09:42,717
News. All the basic, er... news...

137
00:09:42,752 --> 00:09:45,700
- channels.
- "Bizarre events..."

138
00:09:45,735 --> 00:09:48,465
"Coming after me..."

139
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:51,000
- Shaun.
- I'm with customers.

140
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,100
It's your dad.

141
00:09:53,135 --> 00:09:55,167
He's not my dad,

142
00:09:55,202 --> 00:09:57,200
he's my stepdad.

143
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,200
Philip.

144
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,200
Shaun.

145
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:09,300
You haven't forgotten about tomorrow?

146
00:10:09,335 --> 00:10:12,400
- No.
- Your bimonthly visit.

147
00:10:12,435 --> 00:10:14,365
No, I haven't forgotten.

148
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,000
You could bring the flowers
you forgot on Mother's Day.

149
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,000
I was gonna.

150
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:21,500
And not a cheap posy
from a garage forecourt.

151
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,900
I wasn't gonna.

152
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,400
Well, we look forward to
seeing you tomorrow.

153
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,000
OK.

154
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,100
You've got red on you.

155
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,100
- I thought it wasn't a social gathering?
- What?

156
00:10:42,135 --> 00:10:45,200
How comes you're allowed to
speak to your dad?

157
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:48,400
A, he's not my dad, OK? He's my stepdad.

158
00:10:48,435 --> 00:10:51,165
And B, it was an emergency.

159
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,665
What, like buying your mum some flowers?

160
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:59,800
Noel, I do not find it difficult
to keep my work and my social life separate.

161
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:02,300
Shaun, it's Liz for you.

162
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,265
- Hello.
- "Hello, it's me."

163
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,500
- Hello.
- "Did you get my message?"

164
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,000
- Yep.
- "So it's all OK, then?"

165
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:15,100
- Yep.
- "Eight at the place with all the fish?

166
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,550
"Cool, that's great. Just ring me later."

167
00:11:18,585 --> 00:11:21,865
- Goodbye, Liz.
- "Bye. Bye, bye, bye."

168
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:25,200
Liz from Head Office.
It's nothing to panic about.

169
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,500
Sir? Sir?

170
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,100
Sorry. Erm, they're for my mum.

171
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:39,500
Mum. "To a wonderful Mum"
or "Supermum"?

172
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,300
- Er... the first one.
- Right.

173
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:02,500
"...London seems
to have gone completely bonkers..."

174
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:27,900
- Oh, my God! Shaun!
- Yvonne.

175
00:12:27,935 --> 00:12:30,800
Oooh! How are you doing?

176
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:33,200
- Surviving.
- Are you living round here?

177
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:36,300
- Yeah, are you?
- Yeah, I just bought a place.

178
00:12:36,335 --> 00:12:39,400
- Bought?
- I know, bit grown-up, eh?

179
00:12:39,435 --> 00:12:41,700
- Are you still with...?
- Liz.

180
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:46,000
That's great. Glad somebody made it.
How long's that been now?

181
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:50,300
- Er, it's three years ago last week.
- Did you do anything special?

182
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:53,300
- We're going out for a meal tonight.
- Anywhere nice?

183
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:57,100
Yeah...

184
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,000
Come on!

185
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,500
- Are you gonna thank me, then?
- For what?

186
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,465
Tidying up.

187
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,600
- It doesn't look tidy.
- I had a few beers when I finished.

188
00:13:13,635 --> 00:13:16,067
"Hello, Fulci's. Can you hold, please?"

189
00:13:16,102 --> 00:13:18,401
- Do you want your messages?
- What?

190
00:13:18,436 --> 00:13:20,700
Your mum rang about tomorrow night.

191
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,600
Liz rang about the two of you
eating out tonight.

192
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:27,400
Then your mum rang back to see
if I wanted to eat her out tonight.

193
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:30,665
- "Hello, Fulci's."
- Hi, I know it's short notice

194
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:35,000
but could you possibly do me
a table for two for tonight at about eight?

195
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,900
"Sorry, we just gave away the last table."

196
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:44,000
Wasn't true about your mum.

197
00:13:44,035 --> 00:13:45,565
Where are we gonna go?

198
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,500
- The Winchester.
- Don't be stupid! They don't do food.

199
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,800
- There's a Breville out back.
- Ed, this is serious!

200
00:13:51,835 --> 00:13:53,665
Hello.

201
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,700
- "Hello, it's me."
- Hello.

202
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,665
"What's the plan, then?"

203
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:02,000
Erm, there's been a bit of a...
a mix-up with the table, babe.

204
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:05,400
- "What do you mean?"
- They're full up.

205
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:08,100
"But... I thought you said it was all OK?"

206
00:14:08,135 --> 00:14:09,900
Yeah.

207
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,800
"You didn't book it, did you, Shaun?"

208
00:14:12,835 --> 00:14:15,600
- No.
- "So... what is the plan, then?"

209
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,700
The Winchester?

210
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,200
- "Hello?"
- Dianne, can you let me in?

211
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:32,100
- "I'm not sure, Shaun."
- Oh, come on.

212
00:14:32,135 --> 00:14:34,665
"Lizzie doesn't want to see you."

213
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:38,500
- Just open the door!
- "She doesn't want to see you."

214
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:43,400
Do you want me to climb up the wall,
come through the window? Because I will.

215
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,400
"You're not coming in."

216
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,800
- OK, see you in a minute.
- "Don't..."

217
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,900
"Hi, it's me again."

218
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,500
Can we just talk about this? Let's go out.

219
00:15:03,535 --> 00:15:06,000
- To the Winchester?
- Do you want to?

220
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,900
- No, I don't fucking want to!
- OK.

221
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,100
It's not the only place in the world.

222
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:14,165
We'll go to the Shepherd's,
they do Thai in there.

223
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:17,000
- I'm going out with David and Di.
- Let's go together.

224
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:20,400
You hang out with my friends?
"A failed actress and a twat"?

225
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:24,000
That's harsh.
I did not call Dianne a failed actress.

226
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:28,500
Let's just go somewhere and have a laugh.
Things'll be fine, I promise.

227
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,465
You promised you'd stop smoking.

228
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:33,700
You promised you'd try drinking
red wine instead of beer!

229
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:37,100
- You promised we'd go on holiday.
- We went to Greece!

230
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,465
- We met in Greece.
- At a rave.

231
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:42,400
It's not the same.
You promised things would change.

232
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,765
- You promised us free cable.
- I'm working on that.

233
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:50,100
I can give up smoking whenever I want.
See, don't need them.

234
00:15:50,135 --> 00:15:52,000
W- What was the next one?

235
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:54,400
It's not enough, Shaun.

236
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:59,100
"We appear to have
a breakdown in communication there.

237
00:15:59,135 --> 00:16:01,700
"If you or someone you know may..."

238
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,200
I'd say your nine lives were up, Shaun.

239
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:06,065
Get fucked, four-eyes!

240
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:08,700
You go out with her, you love her so much.

241
00:16:08,735 --> 00:16:10,700
What do you mean by that?

242
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:16,100
"...the devastation really is extensive.
It's a total mess."

243
00:16:16,135 --> 00:16:18,400
I don't know what he meant by that.

244
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,000
Got you these.

245
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,900
- "To a wonderful mum"?
- Oooh!

246
00:16:32,935 --> 00:16:35,465
Yeah, that's because...

247
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:39,700
I thought it would be funny
because of what you said last night

248
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,465
about you don't want to be
my mum and that.

249
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:46,300
It's just a little joke,
just sort of spur of the moment.

250
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:50,300
- They're for your mum, aren't they?
- Yeah.

251
00:16:50,335 --> 00:16:52,000
Smooth.

252
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,600
If I don't do something, I'll end up in that pub

253
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:05,900
for the rest of my life
like those other sad old fuckers

254
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,550
wondering what the hell happened.

255
00:17:08,585 --> 00:17:11,100
What do you mean do something?

256
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:46,265
Fuck her. You got your pint.

257
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:49,400
You got your pig snacks.
What more do you want?

258
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:53,600
Oh. You want your favourite monkey?

259
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,800
Shall I do Clyde?

260
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,100
See, I knew you'd get over her.

261
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,400
Who the hell put this on?

262
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:25,865
It's on random.

263
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:28,600
For fuck's sake. John, yes please, mate.

264
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:36,300
You know what we should do tomorrow?
Keep drinking.

265
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,265
A Bloody Mary first thing,

266
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:41,600
a bite at the King's Head,
couple at The Little Princess,

267
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:44,900
stagger back here and bang...
back at the bar for shots.

268
00:18:44,935 --> 00:18:47,000
How's that for a slice of fried gold?

269
00:18:47,035 --> 00:18:49,100
- No.
- Come on, man.

270
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,365
Talk to me.

271
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:57,700
She said if she stayed with me
she'd end up in here for the rest of her life

272
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:01,200
like these sad old fuckers
wondering what the hell happened.

273
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:03,065
That is harsh.

274
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:06,700
- These are rich, interesting characters.
- Like who?

275
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:13,600
Snakehips. Always surrounded by women.

276
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,465
He's a bigamist.

277
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:18,500
Strangled his first wife
with a draught excluder.

278
00:19:18,535 --> 00:19:20,700
And invented the mobile disco.

279
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,950
What about her, then?

280
00:19:23,985 --> 00:19:26,300
Ooh! Cockacidal maniac.

281
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,065
She's an ex-porn star.

282
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:34,200
They say she starred in
the world's first interracial hardcore loop.

283
00:19:34,235 --> 00:19:37,000
Cafe Au Lait...

284
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:39,500
Pour Vous.

285
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,800
Yeah. What about John, then?

286
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:45,800
He's North London Mafia.

287
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,800
It's true, Big Al says so.

288
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:50,665
Yeah, Big Al also says dogs can't look up.

289
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:54,800
Think about it. Handy with a blade.
Gruff demeanour.

290
00:19:54,835 --> 00:19:56,965
Bernie, the trophy wife.

291
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,700
He's connected.
Why is there a rifle above the bar?

292
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,950
- The pub's called the Winchester.
- Exactly.

293
00:20:02,985 --> 00:20:06,100
See, you don't need Liz to have a good time.

294
00:20:06,135 --> 00:20:08,000
- Don't, man.
- No.

295
00:20:08,035 --> 00:20:10,100
Oi, look at me.

296
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:14,700
Can I just say one thing? I'm not gonna
say there's plenty more fish in the sea,

297
00:20:14,735 --> 00:20:17,100
I'm not gonna say if you love her let her go

298
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:22,300
and I'm not gonna bombard you with clichés
but what I will say is this...

299
00:20:22,335 --> 00:20:24,100
it's not the end of the world.

300
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,900
Sorry, we're closed.

301
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,200
Pisshead.

302
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,500
Oh?

303
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,900
What's the matter, love,
haven't you had your tea?

304
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,900
Shh!

305
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,700
Blow!

306
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,600
What? He should say base.

307
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,450
Or freeze.

308
00:21:27,485 --> 00:21:29,200
What a tit.

309
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,700
Don't scratch it! Wait...

310
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:55,500
- That was the second album I ever bought!
- It's four in the fucking morning!

311
00:21:55,535 --> 00:21:57,500
- It's Saturday!
- No, it's not.

312
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,765
It's fucking Sunday
and I've got to go to fucking work

313
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:04,700
in four fucking hours
because every other fucker is fucking ill!

314
00:22:04,735 --> 00:22:07,200
Now can you see why I'm so fucking angry?

315
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:09,065
- Fuck, yeah!
- Hey! Pete, look,

316
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:14,600
I'm sorry, we had a couple of drinks,
we split up with Liz tonight.

317
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,500
Just keep it down, yeah?

318
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,000
Prick.

319
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,800
What was that?

320
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,265
Nothing.

321
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:28,150
- Stop it, we're friends!
- He's not my friend. He's a fucking idiot.

322
00:22:28,185 --> 00:22:32,000
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It means why don't you fuck off!

323
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:35,700
You wanna live like an animal,
live in the shed, you thick fuck!

324
00:22:35,735 --> 00:22:38,300
- Leave him alone!
- Stop defending him.

325
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,165
All he ever does is hold you back.

326
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:44,100
Or is it easier having someone around
who's more of a loser than you?

327
00:22:44,135 --> 00:22:47,300
- What's that supposed to mean?
- You know what I mean.

328
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,000
I assume it was Liz who did the dumping?

329
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:54,050
Sort your fucking life out, mate.

330
00:22:54,085 --> 00:22:56,700
What's up with your hand, man?

331
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:01,100
- I got mugged on the way home from work.
- By who?

332
00:23:01,135 --> 00:23:04,100
- Some crackheads. One of them bit me.
- Why?

333
00:23:04,135 --> 00:23:07,165
I don't know, I didn't stop to ask them!

334
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:11,100
I've got a splitting headache
and your stupid hip hop isn't helping.

335
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,900
And the front door is open. Again!

336
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:19,400
It's not hip hop, it's electro. Prick.

337
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:22,000
Next time I see him, he's dead.

338
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:35,800
"Shaun, it's me.
I'm gonna be a bit tied up today

339
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:39,300
"so can you book the table
for eight rather than seven?

340
00:23:39,335 --> 00:23:41,300
"I'll try you at work. Bye, bye."

341
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:45,365
"Hello, pickle. It's me, Mum.

342
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:49,700
"Dad mentioned you might be visiting
tomorrow which would be lovely.

343
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:52,900
"Will you be bringing
Elizabeth with you this time?

344
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,400
"Only we can't wait to meet her finally

345
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:59,800
"and also I was wondering
if she wanted anything special for lunch?

346
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:03,600
"Cos these days a lot of people
don't eat meat."

347
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,400
Do you want anything from the shop?

348
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,700
Cornetto.

349
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:29,200
Nelson, have you got any papers?

350
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:33,400
Nelson? I haven't even...

351
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:35,500
I owe you about 15p.

352
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,500
Oh dear.

353
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,200
Sorry, I haven't got any change.

354
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:17,100
I didn't even have enough
at the fucking shop. Oh dear.

355
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:32,100
"...no official comment but religious groups
are calling it Judgement Day. There's..."

356

- "...number of reports of..."
- "...serious attacks on..."

357
00:26:38,535 --> 00:26:41,300
- "...people who are being..."
- "...eaten alive."

358

00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,765

"...or ideological connection between
those committing the atrocities..."

- "...emergency services..."
- What?

364
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,800
In the garden, there is a girl.

Excuse me.

370
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,400
Hello.

371
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,900
- What are you doing?
- Oi!

372
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:53,300
Oh, my God.

373
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,800
She's so drunk.

374
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:03,265
How much have you had, love?

375
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:06,000
- Oh! I think she likes you.
- Shut up.

376
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:09,400
- She wants a cuddle!
- I've just come out of a relationship.

377
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:13,100
- Ed, do something!
- Wait there.

378
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,200
- Ed!
- Two seconds.

379
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:17,900
I'm really flattered and everything but...

380
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,500
And, hold it there.

381
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,600
Ed! Just get her off me.

382
00:28:23,635 --> 00:28:25,800
Jesus!

383
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:31,500
- What's up with her eyes?
- Now, seriously...

384
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:35,300
Mary, I'm warning you,
I'll have to get physical, I mean it!

385
00:28:35,335 --> 00:28:37,400
This is it... Look, just fuck off!

386
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:12,900
- I think we should go back inside.
- OK.

387
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,700
- Shaun, what's going on?
- Shit, it's engaged.

388
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:27,000
- How about an ambulance?
- It's engaged, Ed.

389
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:31,165
- Fire engine?
- It's one number and it's busy!

390
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:35,900
- And what do you want a fire engine for?
- Anything with flashing lights.

391
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,100
Are they still out there?

392
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:47,800
Yeah. What do you think we should do?

393
00:29:47,835 --> 00:29:49,465
Have a sit-down?

394
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:52,200

the attackers seem slow and shambolic..."

- "If you're confronted..."

- No, we should stay inside.

- We can take 'em.
- The man said to stay indoors.

409
00:31:07,835 --> 00:31:10,400
- Fuck the man.
- In here, we're safe.

Aim for the head.

414
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:55,800
- Now what?
- Get more stuff.

415
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:58,300
- What's in the shed?
- Dunno, it's locked.

416
00:31:58,335 --> 00:32:00,700
- Why is it locked?
- It's always been locked.

417
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,700
No! That's the second album I ever bought!

418
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:15,200
Some of these are limited...
Ah! What was that?

419
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:17,700
- Blue Monday.
- That was an original pressing.

420
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,800
For fuck's sake.

421
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:21,765
- Erm... Purple Rain?
- No.

422
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,500
- Sign O' The Times?
- Definitely not.

423
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,600
- The Batman soundtrack?
- Throw it.

424
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,000
- Dire Straits?
- Throw it.

- Er... Ooh, Stone Roses?
- No.

426

- I like it.

427

Ah! Sade?

428
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:42,400
- That's Liz's.
- She dumped you.

429
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:46,900
- I'm going to the shed.
- You said it was locked.

430
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:01,300
- Which one do you want? Girl or bloke?
- Er... the first one.

431

Pete?

439
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,800
- Why don't we just go up?
- Don't go up there!

440
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:49,800
- Why not?
- Because A, he might be one of them

441
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:52,400
and B, he might still be annoyed.

442
00:33:52,435 --> 00:33:54,265
Pete?

443
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:56,300
Maybe he went into work.

444
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:59,465
How come he didn't drive?
His keys are still here.

445
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:04,000
Maybe he got a lift.
He said he wasn't feeling well. Pete?

446

Oi, prick!

447
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:08,865
He's not in.

448
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:11,700
- You got a fag?
- No, I've given up.

449
00:34:11,735 --> 00:34:14,100
- Since when?
- Since...

450
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,465
Come on, babe. Oh, she's engaged.

451
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:22,000
- That was quick.
- Ed, this is serious.

452
00:34:22,035 --> 00:34:23,365
Liz!

453
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:26,700
- "Shaun."
- Mum! I was gonna call you. Are you OK?

454
00:34:26,735 --> 00:34:28,700
- "Yes."
- Are you sure?

455
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,265
"Some men tried to get into the house."

456
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:35,200
- Are they still there?
- "I'm not sure. We shut the curtains."

457
00:34:35,235 --> 00:34:38,800
- Did you try the police?
- "Well, I thought about it."

458
00:34:38,835 --> 00:34:42,200
- Are you OK? Did they hurt you?
- "No, I'm fine."

459
00:34:42,235 --> 00:34:46,200
- Mum?
- "Well... they were a bit bitey."

460
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:51,800
- Mum, have you been bitten?
- "No, but Philip has."

461
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:53,800
- Oh, OK.
- Has she been bitten?

462
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:55,565
- No, Philip has.
- Oh, OK.

463
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:59,900
- Mum, what state is he in?
- "He's fine. Bit under the weather."

464
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,765
- I see.
- What's the deal?

465
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:06,000
We may have to kill my stepdad.
Mum, you're not safe there. I'm coming.

466
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:09,300
- "I don't want to cause a fuss."
- We're coming to get you, Barbara!

467
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,500
So, what's the plan?

468
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:16,300
Right.

469
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,900
"We take Pete's car, we drive over to Mum's,

470
00:35:19,935 --> 00:35:23,200
"we go in, we take care of Philip."

471
00:35:23,235 --> 00:35:25,400
I'm so sorry, Philip.

475
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:35,700
- Why have we got to go to Liz's?
- Because we do.

476
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,500
- She dumped you.
- I have to know if she's all right.

477
00:35:38,535 --> 00:35:40,900
- Why?
- Because I love her.

478
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:44,065
All right, gay.

479
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:46,750
- I'm not staying there, though.
- Why not?

480
00:35:46,785 --> 00:35:49,365
If we hole up,
I want to be somewhere familiar,

481
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:53,300
I wanna know where the exits are
and I wanna be allowed to smoke.

482
00:35:53,335 --> 00:35:55,465
OK...

00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:01,300

No, wait, we can't bring them back here.

490
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:15,100
- Why not?
- It's not exactly safe, is it?

491
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,950
Yeah. Look at the state of it.

492
00:36:17,985 --> 00:36:20,700
Where's safe? Where's familiar?

493
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,300
Where can I smoke?

Yeah, boy!

00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:58,300
Yeah, I can see it, it's just outside.

504
00:36:58,335 --> 00:37:00,300
Any zombies out there?

505
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:03,000
- Don't say that.
- What?

506
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:04,965
- That.
- What?

507
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,300
That. The Z word. Don't say it.

508
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,800
- Why not?
- Because it's ridiculous.

509
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:13,300
All right. Are there any out there, though?

510
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:18,500
Can't see any.
Maybe it's not as bad as all that.

511
00:37:18,535 --> 00:37:20,500
Oh! No, there they are.

512
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,000
- OK, let's do this, yeah?
- Yeah?

513
00:37:25,035 --> 00:37:27,100
Yeah! I got to do a wee first.

514
00:37:27,135 --> 00:37:29,100
Ooh... can I drive?

515
00:37:29,135 --> 00:37:30,665
What?

516
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:34,500
I always wanted to drive Pete's car.
I might not get another chance.

517
00:37:34,535 --> 00:37:36,100
OK.

518
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:08,400
Ahh! Oh, God.

519
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:12,700
Sorry, Pete. Listen, we're gonna
borrow your car, OK?

520
00:38:12,735 --> 00:38:14,665
Erm, we'll bring it back.

521
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:19,700
And if you're feeling better later,
we're... we're going to the pub.

522
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:23,100
You're more than welcome to, er...

523
00:38:23,135 --> 00:38:24,500
join us.

524
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:35,000
Pete'd be so pissed off
if he knew I was driving his car.

525
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:36,500
I don't think so.

526
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:41,500
Shaun, which button's central locking?

527
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:48,000
Oh, cock it!

528
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:51,200
Get lost!

529
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,500
Drive.

530
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:12,500
"The Church of England
has joined other extremist religious groups

531
00:39:12,535 --> 00:39:15,700
"in proclaiming this
"a sign of a coming apocalypse".

532
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:19,765
"Downing Street is refusing
to be drawn into a religious debate.

533
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:25,300
"The bodies of the recently deceased
are returning to life and attacking the living."

534
00:39:25,335 --> 00:39:28,065
Let's put something else on.

535
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:30,500
What are you doing? Ed, look out!

536
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,800
I think we hit something.

537
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:41,100
Or someone.

538
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,700
Ow!

539
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,865
Are you all right?

540
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:54,900
Come on, let's just go.

541
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,000
Hello?

542
00:39:57,100 --> 00:40:00,100
- He's gonna be dead either way.
- That's not the point.

543
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:07,900
Oh, thank God for that.

544
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:13,800
Ah, hello.

545
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,600
Who's a pretty boy then?

546
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:23,800
You didn't say Barbara had a Jag.
I've always wanted to drive a Jag.

547
00:40:23,835 --> 00:40:26,065
It's Philip's. He won't let anybody near it.

548
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:29,600
I put a Mars Bar in it once
and he chased me with a bit of wood.

549
00:40:29,635 --> 00:40:33,100
- Fuck, it's gorgeous.
- It seems pretty clear, we should go.

550
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,865
Why don't I stay here?

551
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:37,965
What, what, what, what, what?

552
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,800
You know, just look after the car.
If there's any problems...

553
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:43,800
I'll honk three times.

554
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:45,000
OK.

555
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,600
Don't forget to kill Philip!

556
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,900
- Hello, pickle.
- Hi, Mum.

557
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,400
You've got red on you.

558
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:00,600
Yeah. Mum, is everything OK?
Are you all right?

559
00:41:00,635 --> 00:41:02,900
- Yes, I'm fine.
- Where's Philip?

560
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,300
- Dad's in the lounge.
- He's not my dad.

561
00:41:05,335 --> 00:41:06,600
Really!

562
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:09,000
Ed's outside,
we'll take you somewhere safe.

563
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:12,550
- What about the doctor?
- I don't think he's gonna come.

564
00:41:12,585 --> 00:41:16,000
- Philip won't want to leave the house.
- Philip isn't...

565
00:41:16,035 --> 00:41:18,800
Put the kettle on and I'll deal with Philip.

566
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:20,665
- OK.
- OK, then.

567
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:22,365
- You hungry?
- Not really.

568
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,700
- I'll make some sandwiches.
- OK.

569
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,600
No fighting, you two.

570
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:31,600
"...you may ask where is our God?

571
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:36,400
"But throughout the land,
men and women of integrity

572
00:41:36,435 --> 00:41:39,100
"rise up to confront the unseen enemy.

573
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:42,900
"They will not be cowards,

574
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,500
"they will be courageous
in the face of danger."

575
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:54,800
- I'm so sorry, Philip.
- Why?

576
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:57,200
- What have you done now?
- Nothing.

577
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:59,600
What have you got there? Flowers, I hope.

578
00:41:59,635 --> 00:42:02,365
No, it's... cricket bat.

579
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:05,165
- Is that for the jumble, Shaun?
- No. Yes.

580
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:08,600
Your toys are upstairs.
I was going to give them to the jumble.

581
00:42:08,635 --> 00:42:11,600
- I took them all to the tip, Barbara.
- What?

582
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:14,600
- Shaun wants to take us somewhere.
- Don't be silly.

583
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:17,300
Maybe you should stay here
and wait for the doctor.

584
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:20,600
- You said he wasn't coming.
- You didn't call the doctor?

585
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:25,400
- Just to be on the safe side.
- I'm fine. I ran it under a cold tap.

586
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:28,600
We had our jabs when
we went to the Isle of Wight.

587
00:42:28,635 --> 00:42:31,300
- But, Philip...
- It's overblown nonsense.

588
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:35,400
- A lot of drug nuts running wild.
- But I should get Mum away.

589
00:42:35,435 --> 00:42:38,500
- I'm not going anywhere without Philip.
- Mum, look!

590
00:42:38,535 --> 00:42:41,365
How about that tea?

591
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:45,165
Mum, how much do you love Philip?

592
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:48,800
- Two sugars, is it?
- I haven't had sugar in my tea since 1982.

593
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:51,700
Oh, yes. Will you cut me some bread, love?

594
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:54,367
Mum, look, how much do you love Philip?

595
00:42:54,402 --> 00:42:57,000
Do we have to go through all that again?

596
00:42:57,100 --> 00:43:01,100
What would you say if I told you
that Philip's been quite unkind to me?

597
00:43:01,135 --> 00:43:03,000
You weren't easy to live with.

598
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:06,600
- He chased me with a bit of wood!
- You did call him a you-know-what.

599
00:43:06,635 --> 00:43:09,500
- Did he tell you that? Motherfucker.
- Shaun!

600
00:43:09,535 --> 00:43:11,400
Sorry, Mother... Mum!

601
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:15,900
Did you know that on several occasions...
he touched me?

602
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:24,500
That wasn't true.
Made it up, shouldn't have, sorry.

603
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:27,700
- You don't understand...
- No, you don't understand.

604
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:30,600
Philip is my husband
and has been for 17 years

605
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:34,100
and I would at least expect you
to respect my feelings.

606
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:36,800
You must be more adult about these things.

607
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:38,665
Yeah.

608
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:42,800
Come on, Shaun.
There comes a time when...

609
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:46,100
you just...

610
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:48,200
gotta be a man.

611
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:57,600
I'm telling you, it's a fuss over nothing.

612
00:43:57,700 --> 00:43:59,500
Hello, Edward.

613
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:02,000
- Hi, Barbara.
- My, how you've grown.

614
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:05,500
You better believe it.
What happened? Why is he coming?

615
00:44:05,535 --> 00:44:08,900
- It wasn't as easy as all that.
- Are we following you?

616
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,400
No, it's probably best if we...
Where's the car?

617
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:15,400
Hmm... I pranged it.

618
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:17,000
You were parked.

619
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:18,800
Yeah.

620
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:21,300
I guess we'll have to take the Jag.

621
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:25,100
- Philip?
- What?

622
00:44:25,135 --> 00:44:27,100
Look out!

623
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:30,500
Christ!

624
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:41,200
- Give me the car keys!
- You're not driving that car.

625
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:44,300
Give me the car keys!
Ed, get Mum in the car.

626
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,500
I'm on it.

627
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:49,400
Don't worry about me.
Worry about your mother.

628
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:53,600
- Maybe I should drive.
- I've adjusted the seat now.

629
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:55,400
Just be careful!

630
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:08,500
Can you please turn that noise down?

631
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,200
Are you all right, dear?
Would you like another tissue?

632
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:16,600
I'd be fine if it weren't for that bloody racket.

633
00:45:16,635 --> 00:45:18,700
- It is a bit loud.
- Sorry, Barbara.

634
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:23,700
You do realise this is
a 20 mile an hour zone?

635
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:25,300
Oh, yeah.

636
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:30,600
- Here.
- Mum, this won't take a second, all right?

637
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:38,000
- Have you still got the child locks on?
- Safety first, Shaun.

638
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:40,000
You can't...

639
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:43,900
Hey, man, watch the leather.

640
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:49,100
Keep moving. If there's any problems...

641
00:45:49,135 --> 00:45:51,300
I'll do the honks.

642
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,400
"Hello?"

643
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:20,700
Hello?

644
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,700
- Guys, can you let me in?
- What are you doing?

645
00:46:43,735 --> 00:46:46,400
I've come to get you.

646
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,900
- What are you doing?
- I've come to take you somewhere safe.

647
00:47:01,935 --> 00:47:04,065
- We were safe!
- You don't know that.

648
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:07,100
There was two of them out there.
How many are there now?

649
00:47:07,135 --> 00:47:08,300
- Lots.
- Lots!

650
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:11,200
It only takes one of them
to know you're in here.

651
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:14,900
I tried calling but I couldn't get through.
I had to come up with a plan.

652
00:47:14,935 --> 00:47:18,300
- Oh, you made a plan?
- We have to get out of here.

653
00:47:18,335 --> 00:47:20,865
If we don't, they'll tear us to pieces.

654
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:23,700
And that will exacerbate things for all of us.

655
00:47:23,735 --> 00:47:26,500
- Shaun...
- This is not about you and me.

656
00:47:26,535 --> 00:47:28,465
This is about survival.

657
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:32,300
We need to be somewhere more secure,
somewhere we can stay alive.

658
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:34,500
- We're with you, Shaun.
- What?

659
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:37,200
- We're with you.
- I'm not going out there.

660
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:41,900
Daffs! I don't want to be torn to pieces
and if you think about it, neither do you.

661
00:47:41,935 --> 00:47:44,500
- I'm not going if Lizzie's not going.
- She's going.

662
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:46,700
- I'm not staying by myself.
- You're going, aren't you?

663
00:47:46,735 --> 00:47:48,700
- Lizzie?
- Liz?

664
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:56,700
- All right, Flash, what's your plan?
- Great. I've got a car

665
00:47:56,735 --> 00:48:00,100
but it's gonna be a bit cramped now.
Has anyone got transport?

666
00:48:00,135 --> 00:48:02,065
- Yes!
- Great. Where?

667
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:04,900
Oh, no. Well, I've passed my test.

668
00:48:04,935 --> 00:48:06,100
David?

669
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:09,600
I don't see the point
of owning a car in London.

670
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:12,400
Look, just get any blunt objects together.

671
00:48:12,435 --> 00:48:15,067
If you get cornered,
bash them in the head.

672
00:48:15,102 --> 00:48:17,700
Keep together, stay sharp and follow me.

673
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:20,100
So, what's the plan, then?

674
00:48:20,135 --> 00:48:22,400
We're going to the Winchester.

675
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:28,100
OK? Let's go.

676
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:45,600
- Come on.
- Where's the car?

677
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:52,100
What's up, niggaz?

678
00:48:56,500 --> 00:49:00,500
Apologies for the cramped conditions.
Di, stay on David's lap.

679
00:49:00,535 --> 00:49:03,500
Philip, hang in there, OK?
Ed, get there fast.

680
00:49:03,535 --> 00:49:05,700
And, Mum, this is Liz. Liz, Mum.

681
00:49:05,735 --> 00:49:07,600
Hello.

682
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:15,665
Ed, be careful.

683
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:17,950
- Is your dad all right?
- He's not my dad.

684
00:49:17,985 --> 00:49:20,200
- He's bleeding.
- I know! Ed, be careful.

685
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:22,900
Thought you wanted to get there fast?

686
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:26,300
I want to get there in one piece!
Why are we going this way?

687
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,365
Chill out, it's a short cut.

688
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:31,365
- That road goes to the Winchester.
- Shaun...

689
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:35,050
- Liz, please!
- I don't understand why the Winchester?

690
00:49:35,085 --> 00:49:38,665
- It's a pub, it's safe, it's secure.
- They know us.

691
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:42,600
- What makes it so secure?
- It's got big heavy doors and deadbolts.

692
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:44,465
And there's a rifle above the bar.

693
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:49,000
- I would think that's deactivated.
- It's not. John's connected. Big Al says so.

694
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:51,100
Big Al also says dogs can't look up.

695
00:49:51,135 --> 00:49:52,565
- They can't.
- Can't they?

696
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:54,665
- Of course they can!
- Are you sure?

697
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:58,100
Yes! The pub is the right place to go.
Everything is gonna be fine.

698
00:49:58,135 --> 00:50:00,500
- Shaun...
- I turned it off, all right?

699
00:50:00,535 --> 00:50:02,665
What?

700
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:05,900
- Being a father, it's not easy.
- What?

701
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:10,600
You were 12 when I met you,
you'd already grown up so much.

702
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:16,400
I just wanted you to be strong
and not give up because you lost your dad.

703
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:22,800
- Philip, you don't have to explain.
- No, I do. I always loved you, Shaun.

704
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:27,500
And I always thought
you had it in you to do well.

705
00:50:27,535 --> 00:50:31,600
You just need... m-motivation.

706
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:34,200
Somebody to look up to and...

707
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:39,000
I thought it could be me.

708
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:43,400
Would you just... take care of your mum?

709
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:48,900
There's a good boy.

710
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:54,300
- Ed, can you pull over?
- Two seconds.

711
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:59,400
- Ah! Ed, please pull over.
- What for?

712
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:02,300
- Just pull over!
- All right.

713
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:09,065
Whoa, momma!

714
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:12,400
- What the hell are you doing?
- Chill out. Everyone's all right.

715
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:14,500
Stop telling me to chill out!

716
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:18,900
- And everybody is not all right.
- What's wrong?

717
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,465
Mum, it's Philip, he's gone.

718
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:24,000
- Where's he gone?
- Mum, he's dead.

719
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,200
No, he isn't.

720
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:29,200
Get out!

721
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:32,700
Jesus!

722
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:35,900
- Get it open!
- Ed, get the child locks!

723
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Quick!

724
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:42,200
- The child lock!
- Ed!

725
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:03,265
- Now what?
- We keep moving.

726
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:07,000
- How do we get Philip out the car?
- We haven't got time.

727
00:52:07,035 --> 00:52:09,700
- We can't leave your dad.
- He's not my dad!

728
00:52:09,735 --> 00:52:11,665
Mum, he was, but he's not any more.

729
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:15,950
- I really think we could...
- That's not your husband in there. OK?

730
00:52:15,985 --> 00:52:20,200
It looks like him but there is nothing
of the man you loved in that car.

731
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:24,465
Let's go, shall we?

732
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:26,800
You're not suggesting we walk?

733
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:32,400
- Everybody OK?
- Yeah, we're having a whale of a time.

734
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:35,800
Maybe we should all hold hands,
make a crocodile?

735
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:38,100
Do you know where we're going?

736
00:52:38,135 --> 00:52:40,265
- David, come on.
- Sorry.

737
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:42,600
- Do you, though?
- Yeah, totally.

738
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:44,200
Are we close?

739
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:52,065
We're pretty close.

740
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:54,900
- Is your mum gonna be OK?
- Yeah, I hope so.

741
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,850
- Did you contact your folks?
- They're in Antigua.

742
00:52:57,885 --> 00:53:00,792
- Do you think this is happening there?
- I hope not.

743
00:53:00,827 --> 00:53:03,700
About last night.
I know loads of things were said but...

744
00:53:03,735 --> 00:53:06,400
- You said this wasn't about us.
- No, it's not.

745
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:09,265
- You said it was about survival.
- It is, but...

746
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:14,500
You're not just trying to prove something?
I meant everything I said last night.

747
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:19,900
- Maybe this isn't the best time to talk.
- OK.

748
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:22,400
Shaun.

749
00:53:22,435 --> 00:53:23,900
Yvonne.

750
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,700
- How's it going?
- Er, surviving.

751
00:53:26,735 --> 00:53:29,200
Hey, Liz. Long time no see.

752
00:53:29,235 --> 00:53:30,865
Hey, Yvonne.

753
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:33,700
Erm... this is my boyfriend, Declan.

754
00:53:33,735 --> 00:53:35,665
Erm... my friends Mark, Maggie,

755
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:38,650
- my mum and my cousin Tom.
- All right.

756
00:53:38,685 --> 00:53:41,565
This is Shaun and his girlfriend Liz.

757
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:44,500
- They've split up, actually.
- Oh, really?

758
00:53:44,535 --> 00:53:46,600
- Yeah.
- That's a shame.

759
00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:49,850
We should scoot.
Have you got somewhere you're going?

760
00:53:49,885 --> 00:53:53,000
- Yeah, we're going to the Winchester.
- The pub?

761
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:57,500
- Yeah.
- Right, well. Good luck!

762
00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:04,700
Hi.

763
00:54:04,735 --> 00:54:06,300
Hello.

764
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:07,400
Hi.

765
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:09,200
Hello.

766
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:10,800
All right.

767
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:15,900
See? The Winchester's just over there.

768
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,200
- Over where?
- Over there.

769
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:20,700
Just over there, over the 20 garden fences?

770
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:22,500
What's the matter, David?

771
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,100
Never taken a short cut before?

772
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:42,865
Shaun.

773
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:45,600
I'm sure Jill and Derek live round here.

774
00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:02,650
Now, the Winchester
is just over that fence, all right?

775
00:55:02,685 --> 00:55:06,200
Everyone stay where they are, I'll...
Are we all here?

776
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:09,800
- One, two, three, four, five. Yes.
- There's six of us.

777
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:12,100
Mum!

778
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:16,600
I'm coming!

779
00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:19,265
Mum, are you OK? Are you OK?

780
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:22,100
I don't think Jill and Derek do live here.

781
00:55:25,700 --> 00:55:28,200
Shaun?

782
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:31,300
Are you all right?

783
00:55:47,900 --> 00:55:50,600
What are you doing?

784
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:54,600
Shaun!

785
00:55:57,400 --> 00:55:59,200
Yes!

786
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:02,900
No, that's rubbish.

787
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:12,200
- Ooh!
- Yes!

788
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:16,065
Feel free to step in any time.

789
00:56:16,100 --> 00:56:19,100
- You did all right.
- I didn't want to cramp your style.

790
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:21,200
I'm so sorry about that.

791
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
Right.

792
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:30,900
OK, everyone stay where they are.
I'm gonna check if the coast is clear.

793
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:41,300
- Is it clear?
- No.

794
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:43,400
- How many?
- Lots.

795
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:56,100
Oh, well, that is just great.

796
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:58,265
There are a fair few of them, yes.

797
00:56:58,300 --> 00:57:01,600
I trust Shaun has another genius scheme
up his sleeve?

798
00:57:01,635 --> 00:57:03,700
This is hardly constructive, David!

799
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:07,500
- We should have stayed at the flat.
- Why didn't you?

800
00:57:07,535 --> 00:57:11,267
Because... Because, because of...
Captain Wow.

801
00:57:11,302 --> 00:57:15,000
- Will you stop it?
- We'll get nowhere moaning.

802
00:57:22,700 --> 00:57:25,200
Right, let's all shake out.
Get nice and limber.

803
00:57:25,235 --> 00:57:27,600
Or not.

804
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:32,065
Take another look at the way he moves.
Remember, very limp.

805
00:57:32,100 --> 00:57:37,400
Almost like sleepwalking. Look at the face,
it's vacant with a hint of sadness.

806
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:39,600
Like a drunk who's lost a bet.

807
00:57:39,635 --> 00:57:41,700
OK, let's try, shall we? Liz.

808
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:49,400
Nice. Good vocal work.
OK. Barbara, that's excellent.

809
00:57:49,435 --> 00:57:51,800
Sorry, dear, I was miles away.

810
00:57:51,900 --> 00:57:54,150
- D-Daffs.
- Uh.

811
00:57:54,185 --> 00:57:56,400
- Come on!
- Urgh.

812
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:59,800
It's mournful, sorrowful,
you're dead and you hate it. Go.

813
00:57:59,835 --> 00:58:01,465
Uuurgh.

814
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:04,400
- Much better. Ed.
- I'll do it on the night.

815
00:58:04,435 --> 00:58:06,600
This is the night!

816
00:58:06,700 --> 00:58:09,000
- What is that?
- What about yours?

817
00:58:09,100 --> 00:58:11,900
Who died and made you
fucking king of the zombies?

818
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,600
Don't...

819
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:18,065
Yeah, that's pretty good.

820
00:58:18,100 --> 00:58:23,800
Right, let's all try together, shall we?
One, two, three.

821
00:59:15,900 --> 00:59:17,700
Go, go, go, go.

822
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:22,265
Shit! Get round me, get round me!

823
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:26,600
John? John, Bernie, are you there?
It's Shaun and Ed. We come in all the time.

824
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:29,700
- They can hear you.
- We do the quiz.

825
00:59:29,735 --> 00:59:31,165
- They know.
- Stay in character!

826
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:34,300
- I can't see them.
- Shaun, we have to get inside.

827
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:36,865
- Break the window.
- We'll be exposed!

828
00:59:36,900 --> 00:59:39,600
- Break the window!
- Is there another way in?

829
00:59:39,700 --> 00:59:41,600
Yeah, there's...

830
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:44,965
Two seconds. Hey, Noodle.

831
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,750
- "All right?"
- Yeah, man, I can't talk now.

832
00:59:47,785 --> 00:59:50,465
- "You get anything yet?"
- I got nothing.

833
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:53,300
I'm in the middle of something.
Yeah, it's weird.

834
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:57,100
- Oi! What are you doing?
- What are you doing? You stupid moron.

835
00:59:57,135 --> 00:59:59,600
- Fuck off.
- You fuck off!

836
00:59:59,700 --> 01:00:03,000
Fuck fucking off! I've spent an entire life...

837
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:06,200
Look at me. I've spent my entire life
sticking up for you

838
01:00:06,300 --> 01:00:09,400
and all you ever do is fuck things up
and make me look stupid.

839
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:12,400
I'm not gonna let you do it any more.
Not today!

840
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:14,400
Shaun.

841
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:15,700
Oh.

842
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:25,500
You were saying about another way in?

843
01:00:25,535 --> 01:00:27,817
Yeah, there's a...

844
01:00:27,852 --> 01:00:30,100
What are you doing?

845
01:00:31,300 --> 01:00:34,365
- No!
- Get inside.

846
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:38,000
No, they'll follow us.
Keep up the act, I'll have to do something.

847
01:00:38,100 --> 01:00:41,900
- What do you mean do something?
- Hello, hello, over here!

848
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:46,000
Come on, that's it.
Come on, that's it, over here!

849
01:00:46,035 --> 01:00:48,900
Over here! Come on. Oh, bollocks.

850
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,865
- Wait till I've gone then get inside.
- Gone where?

851
01:00:51,900 --> 01:00:57,500
I won't be long, I promise. Come on,
you pasty-faced fuckers, let's go! Follow me.

852
01:00:57,535 --> 01:01:00,800
Come on, this way, that's it!

853
01:01:00,900 --> 01:01:04,700
Come on. This way, follow me.
Come on, follow me.

854
01:01:04,735 --> 01:01:08,100
Come and get it. It's a running buffet.

855
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:10,265
All you can eat!

856
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:12,300
Shall we go in, then?

857
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:23,600
- Come on, Barbara. Leave those.
- I think they're for me.

858
01:01:42,700 --> 01:01:45,300
- He's been gone a good 20 minutes.
- 17.

859
01:01:45,500 --> 01:01:50,700
Either way, we need to think about blocking
up this window. We're totally exposed.

860
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:54,200
- How will Shaun get back in?
- I'm sure he'll knock.

861
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:58,700
- Let's get some lights on.
- David, wait!

862
01:01:59,900 --> 01:02:02,400
- Power's off.
- That's a good thing.

863
01:02:02,500 --> 01:02:05,800
- We mustn't advertise our whereabouts.
- No, of course not.

864
01:02:05,835 --> 01:02:09,700
- Do we, David?
- No, of course not, Lizzie.

865
01:02:09,735 --> 01:02:11,600
I'm just being proactive.

866
01:02:11,700 --> 01:02:15,900
There's no lights, no power.
And there's a hole in the window.

867
01:02:15,935 --> 01:02:19,465
- You did that, you twat.
- Somebody had to do something!

868
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:23,300
We were in a spot of bother. Somebody
has to take control of the situation

869
01:02:23,335 --> 01:02:27,400
and if none of you are prepared
to accept that responsibility

870
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:30,500
then perhaps... I should.

871
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:33,650
- Will Shaun be gone long?
- He'll be back soon.

872
01:02:33,685 --> 01:02:36,665
- How do you know?
- I don't think he'd leave us.

873
01:02:36,700 --> 01:02:42,700
Wouldn't he? How can you trust a man
you binned for being unreliable?

874
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:47,200
A man whose idea of a romantic nightspot
is also an impenetrable fortress.

875
01:02:47,300 --> 01:02:50,200
This is a pub! We are in a pub!
What are we going to do?

876
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:52,800
I could get a round in.

877
01:02:52,900 --> 01:02:56,500
Let's just wait for Shaun. We'll barricade
the window when he gets back.

878
01:02:56,535 --> 01:02:59,117
What then? How long?
Days? Weeks? A month?

879
01:02:59,152 --> 01:03:01,665
- What are we going to eat?
- Toasties!

880
01:03:01,700 --> 01:03:05,200
- There's a Breville out back.
- Great. Saved by nibbles.

881
01:03:05,235 --> 01:03:07,400
Must be why Shaun took us here
before he left.

882
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:11,465
- He's coming back!
- Why? Because he promised?

883
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:16,400
If he does, do you think his master plan
will be anything more than eating peanuts?

884
01:03:16,435 --> 01:03:20,167
Is he just gonna stroll in
and suddenly everything's OK?

885
01:03:20,202 --> 01:03:23,865
I don't know, David!
I don't know any more than you do.

886
01:03:23,900 --> 01:03:28,300
But what I do know is that we're here now
and we have to make the best of it.

887
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,800
- Ed, get me a double vodka.
- Right you are.

888
01:03:32,900 --> 01:03:35,800
I'll have a drink too.
Would you like a drink, Barbara?

889
01:03:35,900 --> 01:03:38,000
- Hello.
- Right, great, fuck it.

890
01:03:38,100 --> 01:03:41,565
We'll have a party
and get completely smashed.

891
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:45,200
We've got our nibbles.
We've got our Mini Cheddars.

892
01:03:45,300 --> 01:03:48,700
- David!
- We got Twiglets. Oh, look, hog lumps.

893
01:03:53,900 --> 01:03:55,365
Pickle!

894
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:57,250
Hello, Mum. You all right?

895
01:03:57,285 --> 01:03:59,100
- Everybody OK?
- Yeah.

896
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:01,300
- Any sign of John and Bernie?
- No.

897
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:03,500
- Check upstairs?
- It's locked.

898
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:06,000
- Phones?
- Dead. Same as the power.

899
01:04:06,100 --> 01:04:09,900
- OK...
- Nice of you to join us.

900
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,500
Yeah, well, I promised, didn't I?

901
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,800
How did you lose them?

902
01:04:22,300 --> 01:04:25,800
I just gave them the slip.
Wasn't difficult. They're not all that.

903
01:04:25,900 --> 01:04:28,500
- Well, how did you get in?
- The back door.

904
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:30,965
I tried to tell you
before you smashed the window.

905
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:34,200
But it wasn't me blowing our cover
by arguing with my boyfriend.

906
01:04:34,300 --> 01:04:37,900
- He's not my boyfriend.
- Might be a bit warm, the cooler's off.

907
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
Thanks, babe.

908
01:04:41,500 --> 01:04:43,400
So, what's the plan, then?

909
01:04:45,300 --> 01:04:47,900
Would anyone like a peanut?

910
01:04:57,500 --> 01:04:59,565
Why don't you do your Clyde?

911
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:02,500
Has anyone seen
Every Which Way But Loose?

912
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:05,400
Ed does the most amazing
impression of the orang-utan.

913
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:08,150
- No, it's not.
- It is. Come on. Do it.

914
01:05:08,185 --> 01:05:10,800
- No, no.
- But it's brilliant. Come on.

915
01:05:10,900 --> 01:05:13,800
- You've built it up too much.
- No, just do it.

916
01:05:13,835 --> 01:05:16,700
Everyone wants to see it.
We could do with a laugh.

917
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:19,200
Do it, do it, do it, do it. Come on, do it.

918
01:05:19,300 --> 01:05:21,300
I'm not a performing monkey.

919
01:05:23,700 --> 01:05:26,900
- The power's on.
- It's not, I tried it earlier.

920
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:30,800
The streetlights are on.
I'll flip the fuses, we can watch television.

921
01:05:30,835 --> 01:05:34,517
- What about the lights?
- Yes. Don't advertise our whereabouts.

922
01:05:34,552 --> 01:05:38,200
The lights are on a separate circuit.
Just flip the mains breakers.

923
01:05:38,300 --> 01:05:40,500
It's quite simple, David.

924
01:06:07,300 --> 01:06:09,900
- Is that it?
- That's it.

925
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:38,400
Liz, erm... have you got a quid?

926
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:41,200
Erm...

927
01:06:43,100 --> 01:06:44,700
Yeah.

928
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,200
Never anything on, is there?

929
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:57,300
What?

930
01:06:59,300 --> 01:07:03,200
- I think we might have a bit of a problem.
- What do you mean?

931
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:10,700
- They followed me.
- I thought you said you gave them the slip.

932
01:07:10,735 --> 01:07:13,000
Yeah.

933
01:07:13,100 --> 01:07:17,500
Well, we'll just have to be
extra quiet then, won't we?

934
01:07:18,900 --> 01:07:20,800
What?

935
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:24,900
Ed, no!

936
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
Turn it off!

937
01:07:57,200 --> 01:07:59,065
Shit!

938
01:07:59,100 --> 01:08:01,700
- Where the hell did he come from?
- I dunno.

939
01:08:05,500 --> 01:08:08,400
- Who put this on?
- It's on random.

940
01:08:08,500 --> 01:08:11,600
Dianne, get Mum somewhere safe.
David, kill the Queen.

941
01:08:11,635 --> 01:08:13,300
- What?!
- The jukebox!

942
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:16,000
- Liz, Ed, grab a weapon.
- What about the rifle?

943
01:08:16,035 --> 01:08:18,000
- Cocktails?
- What do you mean?

944
01:08:18,100 --> 01:08:21,400
The flaming spirits
Get a rag in, light it.

945
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:24,400
- But the whole place could go up.
- What, then?

946
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:26,300
How about pool?

947
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:34,700
John, it's time at the bar.

948
01:08:53,300 --> 01:08:56,100
- I can't find the switches!
- Then get the fuses!

949
01:09:26,300 --> 01:09:30,200
Why is Queen still on?

950
01:09:30,300 --> 01:09:32,700
- We have a situation!
- I know!

951
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:35,900
- Fuck this. Two seconds.
- Ed!

952
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,500
Oi!

953
01:09:45,300 --> 01:09:47,000
Shaun!

954
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:50,700
No!

955
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:54,700
Yes! Yes! In the head!

956
01:09:57,400 --> 01:09:59,200
Ooow!

957
01:09:59,300 --> 01:10:00,800
Shauny!

958
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,300
Why didn't you just shoot him, man?

959
01:10:19,700 --> 01:10:21,800
Ed, for the last time, it's...

960
01:10:25,300 --> 01:10:29,400
I fucking knew it!
What did I tell you? Big Al was right.

961
01:10:29,435 --> 01:10:31,200
OK.

962
01:10:34,700 --> 01:10:36,700
But dogs can look up.

963
01:10:39,300 --> 01:10:41,800
- Has anyone fired a gun before?
- Oh, yeah.

964
01:10:42,300 --> 01:10:44,065
- Apart from Ed?
- I'm a pacifist.

965
01:10:44,100 --> 01:10:46,800
- Apart from David and Ed?
- What was Ed's experience?

966
01:10:46,900 --> 01:10:50,050
- He shot his sister in the leg.
- I think you should do it.

967
01:10:50,085 --> 01:10:53,200
- We should all do it.
- How can five people operate one gun?

968
01:10:53,300 --> 01:10:56,100
- No one has any experience. We've got...
- 29.

969
01:10:56,135 --> 01:10:58,065
- 29 bullets.
- Call them shells.

970
01:10:58,100 --> 01:11:01,100
29 shells. I need someone
to help me reload,

971
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:03,600
everyone else to look out. I will fire.

972
01:11:03,700 --> 01:11:08,500
As Bertrand Russell said the only thing
that will redeem mankind is co-operation.

973
01:11:08,535 --> 01:11:10,600
I think we can all appreciate that now.

974
01:11:10,700 --> 01:11:14,200
- Was that on a beer mat?
- Yeah, it was Guinness Extra Cold.

975
01:11:14,235 --> 01:11:16,000
- I won't say anything.
- Thanks.

976
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:20,900
- They want to come in.
- Get Mum out of the way.

977
01:11:20,935 --> 01:11:24,200
David, Dianne, let's go.
Ed, give me some shells.

978
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:28,600
- Barbara.
- Oh, hello.

979
01:11:28,700 --> 01:11:31,700
- Would you like to come with me?
- That'd be lovely.

980
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:38,100
It's nice to meet you, finally.
Shaun's always talking about you.

981
01:11:38,135 --> 01:11:40,100
- Really?
- Yeah.

982
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:42,100
- Ah!
- Barbara?

983
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:45,900
Are you all right?

984
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:47,800
I've got something for you.

985
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:52,400
Shaun's father gave me this.
Shaun's real father, I mean.

986
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:55,900
- I'd like you to have it.
- Barbara, Shaun and I have...

987
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,900
It seems only right.

988
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:14,500
I didn't want to say anything.

989
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:16,700
I thought Shaun would be worried.

990
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:20,065
Liz!

991
01:12:20,100 --> 01:12:21,900
Here they come!

992
01:12:23,100 --> 01:12:25,300
- Stay behind me!
- There's one!

993
01:12:25,400 --> 01:12:27,700
Sorry, we're closed!

994
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:30,000
- The safety!
- That happened to me on stage.

995
01:12:30,100 --> 01:12:32,100
Cock it!

996
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:40,800
- There!
- Where?

997
01:12:40,835 --> 01:12:42,600
Three o'clock!

998
01:12:47,700 --> 01:12:51,200
- Oh! Over there again. Quarter to twelve.
- What?

999
01:12:51,300 --> 01:12:53,300
- 11:45!
- Keep it simple!

1000
01:12:54,500 --> 01:12:56,200
Top left!

1001
01:12:58,300 --> 01:13:00,400
- Reload.
- I'm on it!

1002
01:13:00,500 --> 01:13:02,500
Come on, come on.

1003
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:07,500
Nice shot.

1004
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:10,100
OK, David, Dianne,
let's block up this window!

1005
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:12,300
Ed, take over a sec.

1006
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:14,900
- What is it? What's wrong?
- Shaun, I'm so sorry.

1007
01:13:14,935 --> 01:13:19,600
- Mum, what's wrong?
- I didn't want to be a bother.

1008
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:25,650
- Mum, I don't understand.
- The man in his pyjamas.

1009
01:13:25,685 --> 01:13:28,900
I didn't want to say anything,
I thought you'd be upset.

1010
01:13:28,935 --> 01:13:31,865
No, you should've said.

1011
01:13:31,900 --> 01:13:34,900
- Take over a sec.
- What's going on?

1012
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,750
- What's up?
- What the hell's going on?

1013
01:13:37,785 --> 01:13:40,500
- Barbara's hurt!
- Just take over a minute.

1014
01:13:40,600 --> 01:13:42,400
Jesus.

1015
01:13:42,500 --> 01:13:44,950
I know first aid.

1016
01:13:44,985 --> 01:13:47,392
Just hang on. Mum!

1017
01:13:47,427 --> 01:13:49,800
- Mum.
- Is she...?

1018
01:13:49,900 --> 01:13:52,100
Just hold on, Mum, you're gonna be fine.

1019
01:13:52,135 --> 01:13:55,200
- I never thanked you.
- For what?

1020
01:13:56,500 --> 01:14:00,200
For these. "To a wonderful mum."

1021
01:14:02,100 --> 01:14:04,800
It's been a funny sort of day, hasn't it?

1022
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:08,250
Oh, no, no! Mum, come on.

1023
01:14:08,285 --> 01:14:10,700
Stop it, stop it, stop it.

1024
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:13,100
Mum. Please don't go.

1025
01:14:24,100 --> 01:14:27,000
- What are you doing?
- We have to deal with her.

1026
01:14:27,100 --> 01:14:29,565
- Daffs!
- For Christ's sake!

1027
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:31,900
- She's gonna come back!
- She's not going anywhere.

1028
01:14:31,935 --> 01:14:34,200
- She'll change.
- She's my mum!

1029
01:14:34,300 --> 01:14:36,900
- She's a zombie.
- Don't say that.

1030
01:14:37,900 --> 01:14:40,200
Move aside. I'm gonna count to three.

1031
01:14:40,300 --> 01:14:42,200
One...

1032
01:14:42,300 --> 01:14:43,600
two...

1033
01:14:43,635 --> 01:14:44,900
three!

1034
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,700
- Don't point that gun at my mum!
- Calm down.

1035
01:14:47,735 --> 01:14:50,100
Don't point that gun at Barbara!

1036
01:14:50,200 --> 01:14:52,500
- Ed, don't exacerbate things!
- What's that mean?

1037
01:14:52,600 --> 01:14:54,900
- This isn't exactly fair.
- Here.

1038
01:14:54,935 --> 01:14:56,700
- Thank you.
- It's OK.

1039
01:14:57,900 --> 01:15:00,700
Please, can we just stop
and think about this?

1040
01:15:00,735 --> 01:15:02,500
Tell him to put the gun down!

1041
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:04,700
She's gonna change. You know I'm right.

1042
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:09,900
And when she does, she'll kill all of us.
That's what your ex can't seem to realise.

1043
01:15:09,935 --> 01:15:12,717
That's what this is about, isn't it?
He doesn't like me!

1044
01:15:12,752 --> 01:15:15,500
He's always hated me
and now he wants to shoot my mum.

1045
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:19,200
- She's not...
- You've never thought I was good enough.

1046
01:15:19,235 --> 01:15:22,300
- What?
- We all know you're in love with Liz.

1047
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:24,700
- That is not true.
- Yes it is!

1048
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:26,700
- That is not true.
- Yes it is.

1049
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:29,365
- What?
- I know you only hung out with me

1050
01:15:29,400 --> 01:15:34,200
to get close to Liz and when she knocked
you back, I was there to pick up the pieces.

1051
01:15:34,300 --> 01:15:37,700
I've come to terms with that, Daffs,
why can't you?

1052
01:15:37,735 --> 01:15:41,100
Lizzie, I want you to know
that my feelings for you...

1053
01:15:41,200 --> 01:15:45,165
David! There are slightly more
pressing matters at hand here.

1054
01:15:45,200 --> 01:15:49,200
- Like "Daffs" pointing a gun at my mum.
- I'm not being unreasonable, "Pickle".

1055
01:15:49,300 --> 01:15:52,200
- Christ, she's not dead!
- She's finished.

1056
01:15:52,300 --> 01:15:54,265
For a hero, you're quite a hypocrite.

1057
01:15:54,300 --> 01:15:57,000
You've gone from
a chartered accountant to Charlton Heston.

1058
01:15:57,035 --> 01:15:58,967
I'm not a chartered accountant.

1059
01:15:59,002 --> 01:16:00,900
- Well, you look like one.
- Yeah.

1060
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,865
- I'm a lecturer.
- You're a twat.

1061
01:16:03,900 --> 01:16:07,500
She's not your mum.
In a minute she'll be just another zombie.

1062
01:16:07,535 --> 01:16:10,600
- Don't say that.
- We're not using the Z word.

1063
01:16:10,700 --> 01:16:14,400
Please can we just calm the fuck down!

1064
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:19,400
Now, I can see what David is trying to say...

1065
01:16:19,500 --> 01:16:21,700
- Thank you.
- Even if he is being a twat.

1066
01:16:21,735 --> 01:16:23,465
Yep.

1067
01:16:23,500 --> 01:16:26,300
And, Shaun... Shaun, look at me.

1068
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:32,400
I can't begin to imagine
how hard this must be for you

1069
01:16:32,500 --> 01:16:34,900
but we can't afford to fall apart.

1070
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,665
Shaun, babe...

1071
01:16:38,700 --> 01:16:41,600
I know you don't wanna hear this...

1072
01:16:59,300 --> 01:17:01,200
You do it.

1073
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:12,800
I'm sorry, Mum.

1074
01:17:14,100 --> 01:17:16,400
Do it!

1075
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:35,100
Well... I think we're all agreed,
you did the right thing there.

1076
01:17:40,600 --> 01:17:42,800
David, no!

1077
01:17:43,700 --> 01:17:45,000
David!

1078
01:17:45,100 --> 01:17:47,565
- Right, I'm leaving.
- What?

1079
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:50,000
- I'm not staying here.
- David, it's suicide.

1080
01:17:51,700 --> 01:17:55,000
- I think you should go.
- We will. We can defend ourselves.

1081
01:17:55,100 --> 01:17:57,465
- What do you mean "we"?
- What do you mean?

1082
01:17:57,500 --> 01:18:01,200
Opening that door now
would be a very silly thing to do.

1083
01:18:01,300 --> 01:18:03,550
- You gonna stay here with him?
- Look...

1084
01:18:03,585 --> 01:18:05,800
- After where he led us?
- Let me finish!

1085
01:18:05,900 --> 01:18:09,800
Shaun didn't ask you to come here.
You came for the same reason I did.

1086
01:18:09,900 --> 01:18:12,500
- Get away from that door this instant!
- But...

1087
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:14,400
David!

1088
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:23,600
I'm so sorry, Dianne.

1089
01:18:23,700 --> 01:18:27,600
Maybe I'm not the one
you should be apologising to.

1090
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:31,900
Shaun...

1091
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:38,850
David! No!

1092
01:18:38,885 --> 01:18:40,900
No! No! No!

1093
01:18:42,700 --> 01:18:44,500
David!

1094
01:18:45,100 --> 01:18:47,200
- No! No!
- David!

1095
01:19:07,200 --> 01:19:09,300
David!

1096
01:19:09,900 --> 01:19:11,565
Dianne, no!

1097
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:13,200
I'm coming, David!

1098
01:19:16,300 --> 01:19:18,400
David!

1099
01:19:18,435 --> 01:19:20,500
Oh dear.

1100
01:19:20,600 --> 01:19:22,700
- Cocktails?
- Do it.

1101
01:19:33,200 --> 01:19:34,800
Stay back!

1102
01:19:39,800 --> 01:19:41,600
Shaun, hold them!

1103
01:19:44,600 --> 01:19:46,400
Heads!

1104
01:19:50,100 --> 01:19:51,900
- Ed!
- Hurry up!

1105
01:19:53,700 --> 01:19:56,000
Shauny, look who it is.

1106
01:19:56,035 --> 01:19:58,500
Fuck-a-doodle-doo!

1107
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:01,565
Ed!

1108
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:03,465
- Shaun!
- Ed!

1109
01:20:03,500 --> 01:20:05,400
Don't groan at me, you thick fuck!

1110
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:07,200
I can't hold them!

1111
01:20:10,700 --> 01:20:12,100
No!

1112
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:17,700
- Shaun!
- Pete!

1113
01:20:19,800 --> 01:20:21,600
I said leave him alone!

1114
01:20:24,700 --> 01:20:27,500
Ed. Ed!

1115
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:30,500
Shaun, bar!

1116
01:20:41,200 --> 01:20:43,000
Ed!

1117
01:20:43,800 --> 01:20:45,600
Ed!

1118
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:48,400
Ed!

1119
01:20:48,435 --> 01:20:50,600
What?

1120
01:20:50,700 --> 01:20:52,800
Chuck us a cloth, will you?

1121
01:21:05,500 --> 01:21:07,900
- Where are the shells?
- They're on the bar.

1122
01:21:07,935 --> 01:21:10,400
Oh, fuck.

1123
01:21:10,900 --> 01:21:12,565
Ow!

1124
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:14,165
Fuck it!

1125
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:17,000
What are we gonna do?
Where are we gonna go?

1126
01:21:17,100 --> 01:21:19,400
- The cellar.
- Maybe we can get out!

1127
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:24,300
- There's a hatch out on to the street.
- You mean go back outside?

1128
01:21:24,335 --> 01:21:27,000
Oh, give us a fucking break!

1129
01:21:32,700 --> 01:21:34,900
Go!

1130
01:21:44,100 --> 01:21:46,200
I can see the street.

1131
01:21:47,200 --> 01:21:48,500
Come on.

1132
01:21:49,900 --> 01:21:51,900
Come on!

1133
01:21:52,700 --> 01:21:55,300
Why won't it open?

1134
01:22:04,900 --> 01:22:08,900
That's it then, we're trapped.
"Hey, let's go to the Winchester!"

1135
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:10,800
Whose fucking idea was that?

1136
01:22:10,900 --> 01:22:13,600
Man, I've really ballsed this up.

1137
01:22:16,900 --> 01:22:20,400
- No, you haven't.
- I have, Liz. I couldn't save us.

1138
01:22:20,500 --> 01:22:25,065
I couldn't save Di or David.
I couldn't even save Mum. I'm useless.

1139
01:22:25,100 --> 01:22:30,500
You shouldn't feel so responsible, you tried.
You did something, that's what counts.

1140
01:22:32,500 --> 01:22:34,400
Yeah, I suppose.

1141
01:22:36,900 --> 01:22:39,500
Do you think they'll get through?

1142
01:22:39,535 --> 01:22:41,300
Yeah.

1143
01:22:42,700 --> 01:22:44,800
How many shells have we got left?

1144
01:22:44,900 --> 01:22:47,900
Erm... two.

1145
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:52,900
I suppose we could take a few of them out
if they stand in a line.

1146
01:22:52,935 --> 01:22:55,100
I wasn't thinking about them.

1147
01:22:55,135 --> 01:22:56,800
I know.

1148
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:06,000
- What about Ed? There's only two shells.
- I don't mind being eaten.

1149
01:23:09,700 --> 01:23:12,100
How are we gonna do this?

1150
01:23:12,135 --> 01:23:14,665
I don't know. Erm...

1151
01:23:14,700 --> 01:23:16,700
One of us has to go first.

1152
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:19,800
One should do the other
and then do themselves.

1153
01:23:19,900 --> 01:23:22,800
You should do me.
I'll muck it up if I have to do myself.

1154
01:23:31,500 --> 01:23:34,800
I don't think I've got it in me
to shoot my flatmate,

1155
01:23:34,835 --> 01:23:38,100
my mum and my girlfriend
all in the same evening.

1156
01:23:39,400 --> 01:23:41,500
What makes you think I've taken you back?

1157
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:43,400
Well...

1158
01:23:44,400 --> 01:23:47,400
you don't want to die single, do you?

1159
01:23:47,435 --> 01:23:50,400
Actually... I would like to be shot.

1160
01:23:51,400 --> 01:23:55,600
Besides, I've changed. I haven't had a fag
since yesterday, I promise.

1161
01:23:55,700 --> 01:23:57,700
He hasn't.

1162
01:23:59,300 --> 01:24:01,600
Maybe we should have one now.

1163
01:24:04,700 --> 01:24:07,600
- You left them in my flat.
- Yeah, in the bin.

1164
01:24:07,700 --> 01:24:10,600
- I was desperate.
- Sneaky monkey.

1165
01:24:10,700 --> 01:24:13,800
- Sorry.
- I won't say anything.

1166
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:27,900
Come on, we're getting out of here.

1167
01:24:28,900 --> 01:24:31,765
- I might just stay here.
- But we can get out.

1168
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:35,200
- You two should make a go of it.
- What are you talking about?

1169
01:24:35,300 --> 01:24:38,500
- I only hold you back.
- Yeah, but...

1170
01:24:44,100 --> 01:24:46,100
Maybe you should have this.

1171
01:24:47,300 --> 01:24:49,000
- Don't you want it?
- No.

1172
01:24:49,100 --> 01:24:51,900
I can't hit anything with it anyway,
I'm rubbish.

1173
01:24:55,200 --> 01:24:58,500
- Ed, I'm sorry.
- What for?

1174
01:24:58,600 --> 01:25:03,200
- Cos I was shouting at you earlier on.
- It's all right.

1175
01:25:03,300 --> 01:25:05,500
I'm sorry too.

1176
01:25:05,535 --> 01:25:07,500
It's OK.

1177
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:09,200
No...

1178
01:25:09,300 --> 01:25:11,300
I'm sorry, Shaun.

1179
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:17,100
Oh, God! That's not funny.

1180
01:25:17,200 --> 01:25:21,900
- I'll stop doing 'em when you stop laughing.
- I'm not laughing.

1181
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:35,700
You'd better be off.

1182
01:25:45,100 --> 01:25:47,300
Bye, Ed. Love you.

1183
01:25:48,100 --> 01:25:49,700
Cheers.

1184
01:25:50,600 --> 01:25:52,600
I love you too, man.

1185
01:25:55,700 --> 01:25:57,600
Gay.

1186
01:26:17,700 --> 01:26:20,000
- Ready?
- Ready.

1187
01:26:29,400 --> 01:26:31,665
Section One. Ready.

1188
01:26:31,700 --> 01:26:33,900
Zombies to your front. Fire!

1189
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:39,100
Fire!

1190
01:26:53,100 --> 01:26:55,600
Oh, my God! Shaun!

1191
01:26:55,700 --> 01:26:57,300
Yvonne?

1192
01:27:01,900 --> 01:27:05,000
- How are you doing?
- Surviving.

1193
01:27:05,100 --> 01:27:09,600
They're taking us somewhere safe.
I thought you two might want to tag along.

1194
01:27:09,635 --> 01:27:11,800
Is it just the two of you?

1195
01:27:14,300 --> 01:27:17,100
Well, glad somebody made it.

1196
01:27:18,900 --> 01:27:20,900
Come on.

1197
01:27:33,300 --> 01:27:36,600
"Next, the story of
ten-year-old Enrique Ramírez

I still love him and I got the ring.

- "Course I do."

Hello.

1215
01:28:54,700 --> 01:28:56,600
What's the plan, then?

1216
01:28:56,700 --> 01:28:59,450
Right, a cup of tea...

1217
01:28:59,485 --> 01:29:02,200
then we get the Sundays.

1218
01:29:02,300 --> 01:29:04,500
Head down the Phoenix for a roast,

1219
01:29:04,600 --> 01:29:07,100
veg out in the pub for a bit

1220
01:29:07,200 --> 01:29:10,600

watch a bit of telly, go to bed.

01:29:10,635 --> 01:29:13,065
- Perfik.
- I'll get the kettle on.

1222
01:29:13,100 --> 01:29:17,000
- Can I have two sugars, please?
- Ooh! Adventurous.

1223
01:29:17,100 --> 01:29:20,700
- I might pop into the garden for a bit.
- Go on, then.

1224
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:23,600
Two seconds.

1225
01:29:34,100 --> 01:29:36,400
"Player two has entered the game."

1226

Ed!
