00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,516
<i>Say it.</i>

17
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:08,350
<i>I must do better, sir.</i>

18
00:02:08,413 --> 00:02:10,073
Ah!

19
00:02:11,832 --> 00:02:13,551
Ah!

20
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:16,375
Ah!

21
00:02:20,031 --> 00:02:23,999
<i>The tomatoes go in the refrigerator
and the bananas go in the fruit bowl.</i>

22
00:02:24,009 --> 00:02:28,390
<i>I do some of the grocery shopping,
and always do the tomatoes first.</i>

23
00:02:28,425 --> 00:02:30,866
<i>We don't ask for information.</i>

24
00:02:30,936 --> 00:02:33,029
<i>You say that's it?
That's the only problem.</i>

25
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:36,999
<i>People will do that, the tomato crop,
tomato prices will be part of the deal.</i>

26
00:02:37,009 --> 00:02:39,988
<i>Well, I thought that they'll have
a much better product, yeah.</i>

27
00:02:39,999 --> 00:02:45,039
<i>But this lot will grow in the back yard,
pick 'em whenever you want.</i>

28
00:02:48,008 --> 00:02:50,967
<i>If you want to eat tomatoes
12 months out of the year,</i>

29
00:02:50,976 --> 00:02:53,924
<i>you're gonna have to pick 'em
at one of these two stations.</i>

30
00:03:50,108 --> 00:03:52,139
What the hell's wrong with you?

31
00:05:52,067 --> 00:05:54,025
Airport.

00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,920
<i>Wake Me</i>

00:06:05,056 --> 00:06:08,035
<i>Come with me</i>

00:06:10,086 --> 00:06:15,024
<i>Be anywhere you like with me</i>

35
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:21,013
<i>Wake me with your warm arms</i>

36
00:06:22,107 --> 00:06:26,117
<i>Let me hear your voice</i>

37
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:41,127
<i>Hold me, hold me near you</i>

38
00:06:43,074 --> 00:06:47,949
<i>It's your choice, oh, Lord</i>

39
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:21,091
<i>- Hello. You've reached...
- John McCleary.</i>

40
00:07:21,102 --> 00:07:23,103
<i>After the tone,
please leave a message.</i>

41
00:07:25,081 --> 00:07:27,081
It's done.

42
00:08:39,951 --> 00:08:41,878
Just go inside.

43
00:08:41,888 --> 00:08:44,065
- What?
- Go inside. Just go, just go.

44
00:08:44,075 --> 00:08:46,929
<i>$300? You parasite!</i>

45
00:08:48,897 --> 00:08:50,107
Mom, I'm back.

<i>50, 60, 70,</i>

47
00:08:53,117 --> 00:08:55,096
<i>75.</i>

48
00:08:55,106 --> 00:08:59,876
<i>I'm not wealthy.
I'm just a woman with $75.</i>

49
00:09:07,022 --> 00:09:08,876
Hey.

50
00:09:12,979 --> 00:09:14,980
Excited to see me, huh?

51
00:09:31,947 --> 00:09:33,947
You actually got me.

52
00:09:33,957 --> 00:09:36,874
- I got you.
- Yeah, pretty good.

53
00:09:36,884 --> 00:09:38,061
Got you, got you!

54
00:09:38,071 --> 00:09:40,081
What is this shit you're watching?

55
00:09:40,092 --> 00:09:42,092
Oh...

56
00:09:43,894 --> 00:09:45,894
Psycho was on today.

57
00:09:47,071 --> 00:09:49,029
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

58
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,915
That scared me.
Oh, boy, it scared me.

59
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:54,882
Then why are you watching it alone?

60
00:09:54,893 --> 00:09:57,935
I don't know.
I should've waited for you.

61
00:10:01,965 --> 00:10:03,966
Ohh...

62
00:10:13,923 --> 00:10:15,870
- Joe?
- Yeah?

63
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,902
Would you just stay a little bit?

64
00:10:18,953 --> 00:10:20,964
Just stay.

65
00:10:20,974 --> 00:10:22,902
- Okay.
- Just...

66
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:25,048
Cos you watched some scary,
fucking movie?

67
00:10:25,059 --> 00:10:27,058
Just till I've finished the movie.

68
00:11:45,063 --> 00:11:47,927
Joe?

69
00:11:47,937 --> 00:11:50,915
Uh?

70
00:11:50,926 --> 00:11:53,010
Mom?

71
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:54,967
Yeah?

72
00:11:54,978 --> 00:11:56,999
I can't turn the tap off!

73
00:11:59,894 --> 00:12:01,978
Oh, I don't have any of the...

74
00:12:03,071 --> 00:12:05,905
I can't find anything.

75
00:12:05,915 --> 00:12:08,102
- What are you looking for?
- I can't find my toothbrush.

76
00:12:08,862 --> 00:12:10,935
It's right behind the mirror.

77
00:12:10,945 --> 00:12:12,050
Wait...

78
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:14,102
Oh, oh, okay.

79
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:20,861
Mom? Come on!

80
00:12:20,871 --> 00:12:23,081
- Let's go. I'm opening.
- No, no, no, no! Stop that!

81
00:12:23,091 --> 00:12:25,101
- Just let me...
- I'm opening the door.

82
00:12:25,862 --> 00:12:27,038
No, no, no!

83
00:12:27,049 --> 00:12:29,912
What are you doing?
What are you fucking around with?

84
00:12:29,923 --> 00:12:32,048
- There's water everywhere!
- I'm not fucking around!

85
00:12:32,058 --> 00:12:35,007
You are! There's nothing.
You keep rearranging... Get out.

86
00:12:35,017 --> 00:12:36,944
I need my space!

87
00:12:36,955 --> 00:12:38,924
- Your what?
- My space.

88
00:12:38,934 --> 00:12:41,079
Alright. Go get your space downstairs.

89
00:12:41,089 --> 00:12:43,037
Okay, I just needed that...

90
00:12:43,048 --> 00:12:45,079
Are you sure
you can get downstairs alright?

91
00:12:45,089 --> 00:12:47,016
What? Yeah.

92
00:12:47,027 --> 00:12:50,005
Yeah, if I do it really slow.

93
00:12:50,015 --> 00:12:52,902
I know what to do.

94
00:15:49,981 --> 00:15:51,919
The man called.

95
00:15:51,929 --> 00:15:53,980
Said he wants to see you, right away.

96
00:15:59,897 --> 00:16:01,897
Did your son tell you that he saw me?

97
00:16:05,866 --> 00:16:07,866
Hey, he was...
with a friend, you know.

98
00:16:07,876 --> 00:16:09,875
It's just... just a coincidence, man.

99
00:16:10,939 --> 00:16:12,938
Did he tell you where he saw me?

100
00:16:13,938 --> 00:16:15,886
No.

101
00:16:15,896 --> 00:16:18,083
No, I...
I know you wouldn't want me to know, man.

102
00:16:19,897 --> 00:16:21,896
Moises didn't mean to see you, Joe. He...

103
00:16:21,907 --> 00:16:23,854
Don't yell at me.

104
00:16:23,865 --> 00:16:25,865
He's just a stupid freaking kid.

105
00:16:26,864 --> 00:16:28,895
- I know, but...
- He...

106
00:16:29,978 --> 00:16:31,978
We're done, Angel.

107
00:16:33,999 --> 00:16:35,999
Joe, he didn't mean to see you.

108
00:16:38,895 --> 00:16:40,864
Come on.

109
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:42,852
Take the money.

110
00:16:53,009 --> 00:16:54,935
<i>J...</i>

111
00:16:54,945 --> 00:16:56,915
<i>We're like Jack and Jill</i>

112
00:16:56,925 --> 00:17:00,883
<i>K, you're so kissable</i>

113
00:17:01,935 --> 00:17:03,945
<i>L</i>

114
00:17:03,956 --> 00:17:07,080
<i>Is the love light in your eyes</i>

115
00:17:08,975 --> 00:17:12,995
<i>M, N, O, P</i>

116
00:17:13,006 --> 00:17:16,882
<i>I could go on all day</i>

117
00:17:16,892 --> 00:17:19,028
Yes, you could.

118
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:22,892
<i>Q, R, S, T</i>

119
00:17:22,903 --> 00:17:24,995
<i>Alphabetically speaking...</i>

120
00:17:25,006 --> 00:17:27,016
<i>You're okay</i>

121
00:17:29,078 --> 00:17:31,079
<i>You make my life complete</i>

122
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:34,891
<i>V means you're very sweet</i>

123
00:17:35,902 --> 00:17:39,848
<i>W, X, Y, Z</i>

124
00:17:44,005 --> 00:17:46,890
- Mom...
- What?

125
00:17:46,901 --> 00:17:48,900
This fridge is disgusting.

126
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:51,962
- What's wrong?
- You got...

127
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,921
And all this shit's rotten.

128
00:17:56,983 --> 00:17:58,982
Well, honey,
what are you looking for?

129
00:18:01,056 --> 00:18:03,055
This cream cheese is from 1972.

130
00:18:04,899 --> 00:18:06,930
I use it. Just leave it.

131
00:18:15,034 --> 00:18:17,981
- How's Janice?
- Who's Janice?

132
00:18:20,012 --> 00:18:23,855
Oh, come on.
You know who Janice is.

133
00:18:28,022 --> 00:18:30,877
You mean my girlfriend from 20 years ago?

134
00:18:33,835 --> 00:18:35,834
She would've been a good mom.

135
00:18:46,031 --> 00:18:48,040
<i>Stop it!</i>

136
00:18:48,051 --> 00:18:50,063
Joe?

137
00:18:52,854 --> 00:18:54,000
Coming!

138
00:19:46,996 --> 00:19:48,954
Going up?

139
00:20:06,963 --> 00:20:08,963
What's all this?

140
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:14,858
That Cincinnati kid.

141
00:20:14,869 --> 00:20:16,869
Parents are florists.

142
00:20:19,982 --> 00:20:24,014
A warm thank you for getting
their darling daughter back home safe.

143
00:20:25,024 --> 00:20:26,972
Flowers.

144
00:20:26,982 --> 00:20:28,929
Josephine loved flowers.

145
00:20:29,993 --> 00:20:32,846
I could never see the point myself.

146
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:35,856
The fuckers die anyway
and stink up the whole damn place.

147
00:20:37,001 --> 00:20:38,929
God bless her.

148
00:20:40,876 --> 00:20:42,034
Hey, um...

149
00:20:42,981 --> 00:20:45,013
Listen, we gotta lose Angel's number.

150
00:20:46,012 --> 00:20:48,855
- I'll find a new service.
- Okay.

151
00:20:49,991 --> 00:20:52,001
No problem.

152
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:54,855
So, Angel's out.

153
00:20:56,053 --> 00:21:00,970
You could uh... just call me directly,
you know, like a normal person.

154
00:21:09,042 --> 00:21:11,938
There's no green ones.

155
00:21:11,948 --> 00:21:14,843
- I like green.
- Hm.

156
00:21:14,853 --> 00:21:16,874
Fucking asshole!

157
00:21:16,885 --> 00:21:18,822
Why am I here?

158
00:21:19,886 --> 00:21:21,905
State Senator Albert Votto.

159
00:21:23,905 --> 00:21:26,010
I ran his father's security
back in the '80s.

160
00:21:26,988 --> 00:21:28,998
Lost track of him after his arraignment.

161
00:21:29,009 --> 00:21:31,061
I found a green one.

162
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:34,987
The wife - Votto Junior's wife -

163
00:21:34,997 --> 00:21:37,884
kills herself a couple of years ago.

164
00:21:37,894 --> 00:21:41,915
Their teenage daughter's
been running away from home ever since.

165
00:21:47,975 --> 00:21:49,966
I'm listening.

166
00:21:50,965 --> 00:21:53,039
Votto calls me this morning.

167
00:21:53,049 --> 00:21:55,059
She's been missing all weekend.

168
00:21:55,819 --> 00:21:57,028
He doesn't wanna get the cops involved

169
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:59,954
now that he's running
on Governor Williams's ticket.

170
00:21:59,965 --> 00:22:01,954
Ahh!

171
00:22:01,965 --> 00:22:04,943
He's paying 50 grand cash.

172
00:22:04,953 --> 00:22:06,954
What's the lead?

173
00:22:06,964 --> 00:22:09,860
He got an anonymous text with an address.

174
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:15,964
Meet him at the Union Club, 2pm.

175
00:22:18,953 --> 00:22:22,870
Josephine II is coming out of dry dock,
thanks to this.

176
00:22:22,881 --> 00:22:27,817
I'm gonna drive her through the harbor
with a big fucking fireworks display.

177
00:22:29,951 --> 00:22:35,057
You, me, couple of steaks,
cold beers, setting sun...

178
00:22:35,817 --> 00:22:37,816
What do you say to that?

179
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:40,035
What?

00:48:09,505 --> 00:48:11,527
Pick up! John!

359
00:48:11,537 --> 00:48:13,537
What the fuck is going on?

360
00:48:24,358 --> 00:48:26,567
<i>- Hello, you have reached...
- John McLeary.</i>

361
00:48:27,327 --> 00:48:30,370
<i>After the tone,
please leave a message.</i>

362
00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:32,400
John, pick up the fucking phone, man.

363
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:35,546
They fucking shot me, man.
They shot me in the face.

364
00:50:42,359 --> 00:50:44,339
Where's your papa?

365
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:47,380
Huh?

366
00:51:04,347 --> 00:51:06,347
Dumb fucker.

367
00:52:48,464 --> 00:52:50,453
<i>You have reached...

368
00:52:55,442 --> 00:52:57,527
<i>John!</i>

369
00:53:20,545 --> 00:53:22,525
Get out of the fucking way!

370
00:55:36,514 --> 00:55:40,359
- Mummy.

<i>After The Lovin'</i>

372
00:57:06,310 --> 00:57:08,518
<i>So I sing you to sleep...</i>

373
00:57:29,527 --> 00:57:31,506
Who killed my mother?

374
00:57:34,454 --> 00:57:36,506
Was it you or the other guy?

375
00:57:38,516 --> 00:57:40,412
Where are you going?

376
00:57:48,328 --> 00:57:50,462
You don't know?

377
00:57:54,421 --> 00:57:56,380
Who are you?
You're in my fucking house.

378
00:57:58,431 --> 00:58:00,368
Fuck!

379
00:58:15,461 --> 00:58:17,305
Fuck.

380
00:58:20,481 --> 00:58:22,336
Here. take this.

381
00:58:28,522 --> 00:58:30,524
- Want some more?
- Uh-uh.

382
00:58:31,283 --> 00:58:33,293
Alright.

383
00:58:37,282 --> 00:58:40,282
So you killed Votto?
They killed Votto, is that what it is?

384
00:58:44,345 --> 00:58:48,277
<i>All I need is the
air that I breathe</i>

385
00:58:48,374 --> 00:58:51,662
<i>Yes, to love you</i>

386
00:58:51,697 --> 00:58:54,312
I don't want it out.

387
00:58:54,323 --> 00:58:56,396
<i>All I need is the
air that I breathe</i>

388
00:58:56,406 --> 00:58:58,405
There's always crying.

389
00:59:02,290 --> 00:59:04,436
<i>All I need is the air
that I breathe</i>

390
00:59:04,447 --> 00:59:06,342
All of it is...

391
00:59:08,312 --> 00:59:10,478
Okay.

392
00:59:10,488 --> 00:59:14,435
<i>All I need is the
air that I breathe</i>

393
00:59:14,446 --> 00:59:17,300
Hey, where is she?

394
00:59:20,289 --> 00:59:21,477
Where is Nina now?

395
00:59:27,373 --> 00:59:29,342
Williams.

396
00:59:29,352 --> 00:59:31,424
Governor Williams?

397
00:59:33,289 --> 00:59:35,278
She's his favorite.

398
00:59:36,466 --> 00:59:38,455
He trades them.

399
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:44,361
<i>I've Never Been To Me</i>

400
00:59:44,372 --> 00:59:46,403
<i>And I showed 'em what I've got</i>

401
00:59:46,413 --> 00:59:49,330
<i>I've been undressed by kings</i>

402
00:59:49,341 --> 00:59:51,340
<i>And I've seen some things</i>

403
00:59:51,350 --> 00:59:55,318
<i>That a woman ain't supposed to see</i>

404
00:59:55,328 --> 00:59:56,505
<i>Do you know what paradise is?</i>

405
00:59:56,516 --> 01:00:01,391
<i>It's a lie, a fantasy we create about
people and places as we'd like them to be</i>

406
01:00:01,401 --> 01:00:04,380
Was my mother afraid?

407
01:00:04,391 --> 01:00:07,474
<i>It's that little baby you're holding
and it's the man you fought with</i>

408
01:00:07,484 --> 01:00:09,442
She was sleeping.

409
01:00:09,452 --> 01:00:12,317
<i>The same one you're going
to make love with tonight</i>

410
01:00:12,327 --> 01:00:14,380
<i>That's truth, that's love</i>

411
01:00:14,390 --> 01:00:17,451
<i>Sometimes I've been to crying</i>

412
01:00:17,462 --> 01:00:19,431
<i>For unborn children</i>

413
01:00:19,442 --> 01:00:22,328
<i>That might have
made me complete</i>

414
01:00:22,339 --> 01:00:24,515
<i>But I took the sweet life</i>

415
01:00:25,275 --> 01:00:28,378
<i>And never knew I'd be bitter</i>

416
01:00:28,389 --> 01:00:30,305
<i>From the sweet</i>

417
01:00:30,316 --> 01:00:33,481
<i>I've spent my life exploring</i>

418
01:00:33,492 --> 01:00:37,450
<i>That cost too much to be free</i>

419
01:00:37,461 --> 01:00:38,848
<i>Hey, lady,</i>

420
01:00:38,862 --> 01:00:44,727
<i>I've been to paradise</i>

421
01:00:46,346 --> 01:00:52,298
<i>But I've never been to me</i>

422
01:00:52,408 --> 01:00:57,335
<i>Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh</i>

423
01:00:58,354 --> 01:01:03,428
<i>I've been to paradise</i>

424
01:01:03,439 --> 01:01:06,438
<i>I've been to Georgia
and California</i>

425
01:04:41,318 --> 01:04:43,400
<i>What are you doing?</i>

426
01:05:24,523 --> 01:05:30,439
<i>40, 39, 38, 37, 36,</i>

427
01:05:30,449 --> 01:05:33,767
<i>35, 34,</i>

428
01:05:34,073 --> 01:05:37,182

<i>21, 20, 19,</i>

<i>18, 17, 16...</i>

435
01:07:29,492 --> 01:07:31,491
<i>Nine...</i>

436
01:07:36,326 --> 01:07:39,429
<i>...eight, seven, six,</i>

<i>five, four, three...</i>

438
01:08:49,352 --> 01:08:51,352
...probably a $50 cab fare.

439
01:09:59,513 --> 01:10:02,294
<i>Angel Baby</i>

440
01:10:14,397 --> 01:10:18,397
<i>It's just like heaven</i>

441
01:10:18,407 --> 01:10:22,355
<i>Being here with you</i>

442
01:10:22,366 --> 01:10:25,417
<i>You're like an angel</i>

443
01:10:25,427 --> 01:10:26,500
<i>Too good...</i>

444
01:10:45,489 --> 01:10:48,343
<i>Because I love you</i>

445
01:11:14,496 --> 01:11:18,466
<i>Please never leave me</i>

446
01:11:18,476 --> 01:11:22,278
<i>Blue and alone</i>

447
01:11:23,298 --> 01:11:25,507
<i>If you ever go</i>

448
01:11:26,267 --> 01:11:30,340
<i>I'm sure you'll
come back home</i>

I'm weak. I'm weak. I'm weak.

467
01:17:44,333 --> 01:17:46,270
It's okay, Joe.

468
01:17:48,280 --> 01:17:49,437
It's okay.

469
01:18:28,475 --> 01:18:32,257
<i>If I knew you were coming,
I'd have baked a cake</i>

Well...

475
01:18:52,349 --> 01:18:54,276
We can go wherever you want.

476
01:18:58,296 --> 01:19:00,297
Where do you want to go?

477
01:19:04,327 --> 01:19:06,316
I, I don't know.

478
01:19:10,327 --> 01:19:11,472
I don't know either.

<i>Had you dropped me a letter,
I'd have hired a band</i>

<i>And spread the welcome
mat for you</i>

486
01:19:30,377 --> 01:19:33,325
<i>Oh, I don't know where
you came from</i>

487
01:19:33,335 --> 01:19:36,313
<i>Cos I don't know
where you've been</i>

488
01:19:36,324 --> 01:19:39,272
<i>But it really doesn't matter,
grab your chair and fill a platter</i>

Well, you look great.

493
01:20:25,415 --> 01:20:28,227
Excuse me, could I get
a little bit of butter?

494
01:20:28,237 --> 01:20:30,300
You know you're not supposed
to have butter.

495
01:20:30,310 --> 01:20:32,383
How do you know
I'm not supposed to have it?

496
01:20:32,394 --> 01:20:35,269
We all know you're
not supposed to have it.

497
01:20:38,434 --> 01:20:40,435
Have a nice day.

498
01:20:53,350 --> 01:20:55,234
Hey.

499
01:20:55,245 --> 01:20:57,256
Joe? Wake up.

01:21:17,432 --> 01:21:19,380
What?

501
01:21:19,391 --> 01:21:21,307
Let's go.

502
01:21:22,327 --> 01:21:24,275
It's a beautiful day.

503
01:21:31,462 --> 01:21:33,409
