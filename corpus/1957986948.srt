[SIGHS]

1075
01:19:54,398 --> 01:19:57,096
ALICE: It's okay,
it's okay, it's okay.

1076
01:20:27,387 --> 01:20:29,259
ALICE: Sometimes I get a...

1077
01:20:29,302 --> 01:20:31,565
a word or a saying
stuck in my head.

1078
01:20:32,088 --> 01:20:33,263
Like a...

1079
01:20:35,004 --> 01:20:37,093
phrase that keeps surfacing,

1080
01:20:37,136 --> 01:20:39,225
and it will just repeat itself
again and again and again

1081
01:20:39,269 --> 01:20:40,618
until it's all I can hear.

1082
01:20:43,839 --> 01:20:46,842
And for a while,
it was this voice asking me...

1083
01:20:49,018 --> 01:20:51,368
"What are the chances?

1084
01:20:51,411 --> 01:20:53,239
"What are the chances?
What are the chances?"

1085
01:20:54,762 --> 01:20:56,242
TESS: What are
the chances of what?

1086
01:20:58,418 --> 01:21:00,116
Um, I don't know. Maybe...

1087
01:21:04,816 --> 01:21:07,210
what are the chances I don't
come out on the other side?

1088
01:21:08,951 --> 01:21:10,256
What are the chances
I don't want to?

1089
01:21:17,785 --> 01:21:19,962
[SNIFFLES] And
lately, it's, um...

1090
01:21:23,269 --> 01:21:24,575
someone asking me,

1091
01:21:24,618 --> 01:21:25,881
"Where will you put your shame?

1092
01:21:25,924 --> 01:21:27,186
"Where will you put your shame?"

1093
01:21:27,230 --> 01:21:28,753
And it's my voice, but it isn't.

1094
01:21:33,801 --> 01:21:35,194
You can give it to us.

1095
01:21:37,022 --> 01:21:38,241
Here.

1096
01:22:05,094 --> 01:22:06,356
Did it work?

1097
