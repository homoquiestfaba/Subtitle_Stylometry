1
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,320
Amazing. Eh?

2
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,160
How much longer?

3
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,720
Six an a half hours.

4
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,600
Let's do this now.

5
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,080
So soon?

6
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,120
I want to get it over with.

7
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,480
Ok.

8
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,440
Fine.

9
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,320
Guys.

10
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,240
Anybody thirsty?

11
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,640
Of course. Let's have it.

12
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,700
The Cold War is heating up back here.

13
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,840
Come on.

14
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,360
I won't report you for holding
American contraband.

15
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,480
Shut up.

16
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,760
Yuri, come on.

17
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,080
Just leave something for me.

18
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,960
Come on, come on.

19
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,320
Cheers.

20
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,040
Cheers.

21
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,200
Come on, come on.

22
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,280
Leave something for me.

23
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,600
Thank you.

24
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,320
Cheers.

25
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,920
Good vodka.

26
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:15,160
Give me some more.

27
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,680
Do you want more?

28
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,400
You clumsy bastard, you
wasted half the bottle!

29
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,080
What's happening?

30
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,040
Josef!

31
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,840
Josef!
