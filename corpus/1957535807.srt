00:00:03,562 --> 00:00:07,466
<i>Joining us
for the toss of the coin,</i>

3
00:00:07,499 --> 00:00:09,936
<i>the President
of the United States...</i>

4
00:00:11,838 --> 00:00:16,174
<i>Mr. President,
will you please toss the coin?</i>

5
00:00:17,242 --> 00:00:18,811
<i>It is tails.</i>

6
00:00:25,752 --> 00:00:29,354
<i>San Francisco
has won the toss.</i>

7
00:00:29,388 --> 00:00:31,724
<i>You can elect to kick...
You want the ball?</i>

8
00:00:31,758 --> 00:00:33,325
<i>Which goal will you defend?</i>

9
00:00:33,358 --> 00:00:35,594
<i>Will you put your backs
to the goal, please?</i>

10
00:00:39,866 --> 00:00:43,535
<i>Joe Montana joins
his teammates on the field.</i>

11
00:00:43,568 --> 00:00:46,471
<i>Super Bowl 19.
The Miami Dolphins.</i>

12
00:00:46,505 --> 00:00:48,107
<i>And the San Francisco 49ers.</i>

13
00:00:48,141 --> 00:00:51,844
<i>The best combined records of any two
teams to ever meet in a Super Bowl.</i>

14
00:00:51,878 --> 00:00:55,547
<i>And Joe Montana.
They talk of the cool of Dan Marino.</i>

15
00:00:56,548 --> 00:01:00,285
<i>Super Bowl 19.
Second quarter.</i>

16
00:01:00,318 --> 00:01:03,388
<i>Joe Montana steps
to the line of scrimmage,</i>

17
00:01:03,422 --> 00:01:05,624
<i>drops back to throw,
and then...</i>

18
00:01:05,658 --> 00:01:07,592
<i>Montana in
trouble and Doug Betters</i>

19
00:01:07,627 --> 00:01:08,961
<i>covers him quickly
at the 42-yard line.</i>

20
00:01:08,995 --> 00:01:10,730
<i>You feel pretty
good, then all of a sudden,</i>

21
00:01:10,763 --> 00:01:11,964
<i>the pocket starts to cave in.</i>

22
00:01:11,998 --> 00:01:14,533
<i>Now this might seem
like a failure. A mistake.</i>

23
00:01:14,566 --> 00:01:17,737
<i>But of all the characteristics
needed to be an all-pro quarterback,</i>

24
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:19,639
<i>this one is
rarely talked about.</i>

25
00:01:19,672 --> 00:01:22,507
<i>The ability to stay
in the pocket.</i>

26
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:26,846
<i>To stay calm and collected as a wall
of humanity collapses around you.</i>

27
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:29,548
<i>The courage to stand your
ground and take the hit.</i>

28
00:01:29,581 --> 00:01:32,885
<i>And then have the will to get back
up, and do it all over again.</i>

29
00:01:32,919 --> 00:01:37,790
<i>Drop back, settle,
deliver the perfect throw.</i>

30
00:01:40,927 --> 00:01:43,261
<i>And another record has fallen.</i>

31
00:01:43,295 --> 00:01:44,731
<i>Another one to Joe Montana.</i>

32
00:01:44,764 --> 00:01:46,699
<i>Falling all over the place.</i>

33
00:01:46,733 --> 00:01:49,936
<i>They've really put on a terrific
show, particularly offensively...</i>

34
00:01:49,969 --> 00:01:53,706
<i>They roll to the right.
Montana fires a shot...</i>

35
00:01:55,041 --> 00:01:57,476
How much longer?
I want to play some Atari.

36
00:01:59,746 --> 00:02:01,781
Kurt?

37
00:02:01,814 --> 00:02:04,851
<i>Ever since I saw Joe Montana
become the MVP of that Super Bowl</i>

38
00:02:04,884 --> 00:02:08,553
<i>and break his
all-time pass record,</i>

39
00:02:08,587 --> 00:02:10,288
<i>I knew I wanted
to be that guy.</i>

40
00:02:14,392 --> 00:02:18,563
<i>Over a million athletes play high
school football every year in America.</i>

41
00:02:18,597 --> 00:02:20,800
<i>Each with a dream
of their own.</i>

42
00:02:20,833 --> 00:02:23,870
<i>Only about 5% of them
make it to college ball.</i>

43
00:02:23,903 --> 00:02:28,641
<i>And only 1% of those
get drafted to the NFL.</i>

44
00:02:28,674 --> 00:02:31,644
<i>Most don't stay in the league
for more than three years.</i>

45
00:02:31,677 --> 00:02:33,913
<i>Most are not quarterbacks.</i>

46
00:02:33,946 --> 00:02:36,682
<i>Only a select few will ever
play in the Super Bowl...</i>

47
00:02:36,716 --> 00:02:41,053
<i>And each year,
there is only one MVP of that game.</i>

48
00:02:42,354 --> 00:02:44,857
<i>So, by all accounts,</i>

49
00:02:44,891 --> 00:02:48,961
<i>my dream, my story
is impossible.</i>

50
00:02:50,428 --> 00:02:52,064
<i>That's just
the kind of story this is.</i>

51
00:03:07,013 --> 00:03:08,781
Huddle up.
All right, boys.

52
00:03:08,815 --> 00:03:09,949
Let's do this.

53
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:11,550
Ah...

54
00:03:11,583 --> 00:03:14,787
Trips right, 70-watt special.
On one, ready.

55
00:03:14,821 --> 00:03:17,455
<i>And that
will bring on Kurt Warner,</i>

56
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:20,059
<i>the 5th year senior,
making his first start.</i>

57
00:03:20,092 --> 00:03:23,361
<i>Remember, folks, he's sat
on the bench for four years</i>

58
00:03:23,395 --> 00:03:25,932
<i>even though he was highly
recruited out of high school.</i>

59
00:03:25,965 --> 00:03:27,399
Blue, 60, hut!

60
00:03:27,432 --> 00:03:29,434
<i>Warner takes the snap.</i>

61
00:03:29,467 --> 00:03:32,437
<i>A strong interior rush...</i>

62
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:34,807
<i>...and he's levelled by middle
linebacker Cole Banks...</i>

63
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:39,111
Go home, Kurt!
Go home. Go home.

64
00:03:39,145 --> 00:03:41,047
Come on!
Let's go, baby.

65
00:03:41,814 --> 00:03:42,849
Whoo!

66
00:03:42,882 --> 00:03:44,449
Get set, get set, get set.

67
00:03:44,482 --> 00:03:45,852
Blue, 60, hut!

68
00:03:47,787 --> 00:03:49,121
<i>He's flushed
out of the pocket...</i>

69
00:03:49,155 --> 00:03:51,691
No, no, no, no.
Stay in the pocket.

70
00:03:51,724 --> 00:03:53,826
<i>He's running
out of real estate</i>

71
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:55,661
<i>and throws the ball
across his body</i>

72
00:03:55,695 --> 00:03:58,396
<i>towards the corner
of the end zone.</i>

73
00:03:58,430 --> 00:03:59,966
<i>Touchdown!</i>

74
00:04:04,704 --> 00:04:06,038
How you like that, Coach?

75
00:04:06,072 --> 00:04:08,741
- You still didn't stay in the damn pocket.
- Yeah, you're welcome.

76
00:04:09,942 --> 00:04:12,078
Kicking game!
Move it!

77
00:04:21,087 --> 00:04:22,822
<i>Ineligible, down field.</i>

78
00:04:29,896 --> 00:04:30,963
Okay.

79
00:04:32,732 --> 00:04:34,466
I'm gonna wear this one.
You take this one.

80
00:04:34,499 --> 00:04:36,468
No. I'm staying here.
I got work to do.

81
00:04:36,501 --> 00:04:38,838
Work? Man, you can
hardly call that work.

82
00:04:38,871 --> 00:04:41,707
How you gonna make a highlight
reel with no highlights, huh?

83
00:04:41,741 --> 00:04:43,209
You only started two games.
Just sayin'.

84
00:04:43,242 --> 00:04:44,343
I have
highlights.

85
00:04:44,377 --> 00:04:46,879
- And who you gonna send that to?
- Scouts. Agents.

86
00:04:46,913 --> 00:04:48,948
You really are
delusional, huh?

87
00:04:48,981 --> 00:04:51,651
The NFL's not gonna draft some dude
who's been sitting on the bench

88
00:04:51,684 --> 00:04:53,920
for four years at a
1-AA school in Iowa.

89
00:04:54,687 --> 00:04:55,688
It's madness.

90
00:04:58,024 --> 00:04:59,191
Come on.

91
00:05:00,059 --> 00:05:01,093
We're going out.

92
00:05:02,929 --> 00:05:04,562
I'm never gonna
wear this.

93
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:14,572
Hudnutt, how do you listen
to this music? It is garbage.

94
00:05:14,606 --> 00:05:16,242
We're gonna have
a good old time. Let's go.

95
00:05:29,956 --> 00:05:31,157
Can we get
two Buds?

96
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:32,624
Thank you.

97
00:05:34,193 --> 00:05:35,527
I'm gonna
make a lap.

98
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,629
You do that.
Have fun.

99
00:06:15,634 --> 00:06:16,736
Blue 80, hut!

100
00:06:18,971 --> 00:06:19,805
Hey!

101
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:21,907
No, no, no, no.
Stay in the pocket.

102
00:06:25,778 --> 00:06:27,646
What did I say?
What did I say?

103
00:06:30,615 --> 00:06:32,084
To stay in
the pocket, Coach.

104
00:06:32,118 --> 00:06:33,886
Bingo, hotshot.

105
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:35,688
<i>Hello,
and welcome everybody</i>

106
00:06:35,721 --> 00:06:37,189
<i>to Sports Center,
I'm Karl Ravech.</i>

107
00:06:37,223 --> 00:06:38,991
<i>And a very special welcome
to the newest member</i>

108
00:06:39,025 --> 00:06:41,093
<i>of our Sports Center family,
that's Steve Levy.</i>

109
00:06:41,127 --> 00:06:43,629
<i>The MO Morris
Lewis show of the New York Jets</i>

110
00:06:43,662 --> 00:06:46,632
<i>opened up well off-Broadway in
Pittsburgh against the Steelers</i>

111
00:06:46,665 --> 00:06:47,900
<i>who already had
a preseason...</i>

112
00:06:52,238 --> 00:06:54,572
Hud? I'm gonna need
to ask you a favor

113
00:06:54,606 --> 00:06:56,909
and I'm gonna appreciate you
not laughing at me too much.

114
00:06:57,943 --> 00:06:59,577
Can't wait
to hear this.

115
00:06:59,611 --> 00:07:01,080
I need you to teach
me how to dance.

116
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:07,353
Well, like, dance,
like, line dance?

117
00:07:07,386 --> 00:07:09,789
Like line dancing,
barn dancing,

118
00:07:09,822 --> 00:07:11,623
all the dancing...

119
00:07:14,827 --> 00:07:16,228
Oh, man, this is gonna be great.

120
00:07:18,297 --> 00:07:20,199
This about that girl, isn't it?

121
00:07:20,232 --> 00:07:21,901
That's none of
your business.

122
00:07:32,912 --> 00:07:35,147
You have no idea how
happy this makes me.

123
00:07:35,181 --> 00:07:36,182
Yeah, I do.

124
00:07:36,549 --> 00:07:37,750
You look good.

125
00:07:49,762 --> 00:07:50,796
Oh, wow.

126
00:07:51,931 --> 00:07:53,265
- Hey, uh, bartender.
- Yeah.

127
00:07:53,299 --> 00:07:56,035
Hey, uh,
can you play a line...

128
00:07:56,068 --> 00:07:57,169
Uh, not a line dance.

129
00:07:57,203 --> 00:07:58,337
A barn dance for me?

130
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:04,176
All right,
it's a barn dance!

131
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:06,278
Barn dance!

132
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:09,181
Grab your partner,
do-si-do.

133
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:11,750
Excuse me, cowboy. I'm gonna take this one.
Thank you very much.

134
00:08:11,784 --> 00:08:13,752
Oh, about time.

135
00:08:18,023 --> 00:08:19,358
You don't look
like a cowboy.

136
00:08:20,726 --> 00:08:21,794
That's 'cause I'm not.

137
00:08:22,328 --> 00:08:23,329
What are you, then?

138
00:08:24,163 --> 00:08:25,331
I'm a football player.

139
00:08:27,733 --> 00:08:31,137
My name is Kurt Warner.
What's yours?

140
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:33,772
Nope. Not yet.

141
00:08:33,806 --> 00:08:35,141
That hardly
seems fair.

142
00:08:35,174 --> 00:08:36,375
I mean, I just
gave you my name.

143
00:08:36,408 --> 00:08:37,776
You're not gonna
give me yours?

144
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:38,777
No.

145
00:08:38,811 --> 00:08:40,746
What am I supposed to do?
Just guess?

146
00:08:40,779 --> 00:08:42,181
Go for it.

147
00:08:42,214 --> 00:08:44,116
Okay, all right. Um...

148
00:08:44,817 --> 00:08:46,986
Abby? Abigail.

149
00:08:47,019 --> 00:08:52,124
Gail. Uh, Helen, Isabelle,
Jacqueline, Beatrice.

150
00:09:01,767 --> 00:09:02,868
You're supposed to
be the other way.

151
00:09:02,902 --> 00:09:05,437
Yeah, I know.
I just like this view a lot more.

152
00:09:05,471 --> 00:09:07,106
She won't
tell me her name, so...

153
00:09:08,174 --> 00:09:09,875
<i>You move real good
on that dance floor.</i>

154
00:09:09,909 --> 00:09:12,711
Well, that makes one of us.

155
00:09:12,745 --> 00:09:14,680
Thank you. Actually, it's...
Yeah, okay.

156
00:09:15,781 --> 00:09:17,950
What? I like what I like.

157
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:23,856
So, football?
Tell me about that.

158
00:09:25,024 --> 00:09:26,458
How do you mean?
What do you want to know?

159
00:09:26,492 --> 00:09:28,327
You defined yourself as a sport.

160
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,962
So it must be pretty
important to you.

161
00:09:32,398 --> 00:09:34,333
Hell, I don't know.
I just love it.

162
00:09:34,366 --> 00:09:37,970
Well, I like a man who knows
why he loves something, so...

163
00:09:39,939 --> 00:09:42,174
Okay. Okay,
how about this?

164
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:43,909
I'll answer
your question,

165
00:09:43,943 --> 00:09:45,978
but first,
you gotta answer one of mine.

166
00:09:46,011 --> 00:09:48,981
Uh, what exactly is
Miss August over there?

167
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:53,018
That is, um...

168
00:09:53,052 --> 00:09:54,987
That's a tight-fitting
jeans contest.

169
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:56,455
Oh, is it really?

170
00:09:56,488 --> 00:09:57,923
First Thursday
of every month.

171
00:09:57,957 --> 00:09:59,024
It's the first time
I won.

172
00:09:59,058 --> 00:10:00,092
Congratulations.

173
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:02,027
- It's so embarrassing.
- Yeah.

174
00:10:02,061 --> 00:10:03,462
Um, so football?
Seriously.

175
00:10:03,495 --> 00:10:05,464
You give me an honest answer
and I'll give you my name.

176
00:10:06,865 --> 00:10:08,300
Okay. Um...

177
00:10:09,969 --> 00:10:13,105
So, football was
the most important thing

178
00:10:13,138 --> 00:10:14,840
my pops taught me
before he...

179
00:10:16,108 --> 00:10:18,077
uh, left.

180
00:10:18,844 --> 00:10:20,846
I mean, he's back
in my life now

181
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:23,148
but, you know,
back then it was tough...

182
00:10:23,182 --> 00:10:25,551
and we always,
you know, struggled.

183
00:10:25,584 --> 00:10:27,086
Me and my mom,
my brother.

184
00:10:28,354 --> 00:10:31,290
Never had enough.
And I wanted more.

185
00:10:31,323 --> 00:10:32,758
I wanted to make something
of my life.

186
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,961
And football, um,

187
00:10:37,463 --> 00:10:40,199
is just like the only thing
I've ever really been good at.

188
00:10:42,434 --> 00:10:44,536
So, just feels like
more than a game to me.

189
00:10:48,207 --> 00:10:50,376
As long as I have
a ball in my hands,

190
00:10:52,211 --> 00:10:54,913
then I feel like everything's
gonna be all right.

191
00:10:58,150 --> 00:10:59,518
Is that honest enough
for you?

192
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:07,126
You know, I normally
hate country music

193
00:11:07,159 --> 00:11:09,361
but I kinda like
this song.

194
00:11:10,562 --> 00:11:14,333
Well, I hate sports,
so guess it'll never work between us.

195
00:11:14,366 --> 00:11:16,902
- I suppose so. What a shame.
- Mmm.

196
00:11:19,138 --> 00:11:20,272
What do you like
about it?

197
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:23,042
I don't know.

198
00:11:25,344 --> 00:11:27,880
I guess that it's different.
Kinda like you.

199
00:11:33,252 --> 00:11:34,253
I'm Brenda.

200
00:11:36,522 --> 00:11:38,290
Well, it's a pleasure
to meet you, Brenda.

201
00:11:42,494 --> 00:11:44,229
Last call.

202
00:11:47,433 --> 00:11:48,434
And I gotta go.

203
00:11:49,968 --> 00:11:51,437
Gotta go?
You gotta "go" go?

204
00:11:53,605 --> 00:11:56,141
Hey. Hey, come on,
wait a second.

205
00:11:56,175 --> 00:11:58,177
I mean,
is this something that I said?

206
00:11:58,210 --> 00:11:59,578
Is it something
that I did?

207
00:11:59,611 --> 00:12:01,613
Can I at least get
your phone number?

208
00:12:01,648 --> 00:12:04,550
Trust me. You don't want it.

209
00:12:04,983 --> 00:12:06,118
What?

210
00:12:06,151 --> 00:12:08,655
Wait, wait, wait. Why wouldn't I?
Why wouldn't I?

211
00:12:08,688 --> 00:12:11,156
Why wouldn't I want your number?

212
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:13,292
Look, there's a few things
you need to know about me.

213
00:12:14,593 --> 00:12:16,261
I'm divorced
and I got two kids.

214
00:12:16,295 --> 00:12:19,898
So, if I never see you
again, I totally understand.

215
00:12:34,046 --> 00:12:36,949
- But I don't want to.
- Okay, just one bite for Mama.

216
00:12:36,982 --> 00:12:40,386
One bite. Come on.
Okay, sweetheart.

217
00:12:45,124 --> 00:12:47,059
Well,
I'm making the jam one...

218
00:12:47,092 --> 00:12:48,560
The jelly one
first, honey.

219
00:12:48,594 --> 00:12:51,964
I need you to eat just
a tiny little bit more.

220
00:12:51,997 --> 00:12:54,032
- Mama?
- Oh! Over here, baby.

221
00:12:54,066 --> 00:12:55,334
Over here.
Over here.

222
00:12:55,367 --> 00:12:57,670
Oh, is it broken?

223
00:12:57,704 --> 00:12:59,204
Broken, Mama.

224
00:12:59,238 --> 00:13:01,273
Okay. Mama will fix that
in just a minute.

225
00:13:02,174 --> 00:13:04,309
No, Jesse,
not for you.

226
00:13:04,343 --> 00:13:05,577
But can you just have
a few more bites

227
00:13:05,611 --> 00:13:07,045
of your applesauce,
please, sweetheart?

228
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:08,947
I just...

229
00:13:08,981 --> 00:13:11,183
Mom, can you get that?

230
00:13:22,428 --> 00:13:23,429
Hello?

231
00:13:28,567 --> 00:13:31,170
I didn't mean to scare you.
It's Kurt from the bar last night.

232
00:13:31,203 --> 00:13:32,639
I knocked on the front door but...

233
00:13:38,277 --> 00:13:40,212
This was
a bad idea.

234
00:13:40,245 --> 00:13:41,079
Okay.

235
00:13:41,113 --> 00:13:44,550
Okay, okay,
okay...

236
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:48,120
Mom?
Mom? Mom, help!

237
00:13:54,493 --> 00:13:56,128
Hey. What's going on,
little...

238
00:13:56,161 --> 00:13:57,196
- Come on.
- Oh.

239
00:13:57,229 --> 00:14:00,098
Yeah, hey.
Am I coming in?

240
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:03,068
It's broken.

241
00:14:03,101 --> 00:14:05,204
Oh, it's broken?
Uh...

242
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,676
What's broken?

243
00:14:11,143 --> 00:14:13,178
Oh, the radio is broken. Okay.

244
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:25,357
- Oh, we're going to the bathroom? Okay.
- Broken radio.

245
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:28,795
Oh, well.
You're missing a battery.

246
00:14:28,828 --> 00:14:30,663
That's why we're in the bathroom.
Look at that.

247
00:14:32,164 --> 00:14:33,198
All right.

248
00:14:34,801 --> 00:14:36,034
There we go.

249
00:14:37,503 --> 00:14:40,439
Oh. Country?
They got you too, huh?

250
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:44,209
Lay down.

251
00:14:45,645 --> 00:14:46,713
Okay.

252
00:14:49,548 --> 00:14:51,083
There you go.

253
00:14:53,418 --> 00:14:56,321
<i>♪ You and
me go fishing in the dark</i>

254
00:14:56,355 --> 00:14:59,057
<i>♪ Lying on our backs</i>
<i>and counting the stars</i>

255
00:14:59,091 --> 00:15:02,227

256
00:15:04,631 --> 00:15:07,132

257
00:15:07,165 --> 00:15:08,668

258
00:15:08,701 --> 00:15:14,373
<i>♪ In the middle of the

259
00:15:14,406 --> 00:15:17,543
You know? Maybe country
ain't so bad after all.

260
00:15:21,213 --> 00:15:22,548
What's your name,
little man?

261
00:15:23,248 --> 00:15:24,216
Zack.

262
00:15:24,249 --> 00:15:27,419
Mmm. That's a good name.
My name's Kurt.

263
00:15:30,322 --> 00:15:32,491
You like trucks?

264
00:15:33,325 --> 00:15:36,161
Black trucks. Driver.

265
00:15:36,194 --> 00:15:38,297
Oh, you want to be
a truck driver, huh?

266
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:40,098
A black truck driver.

267
00:15:40,132 --> 00:15:42,835
Oh, what he means is he
wants to drive a black truck.

268
00:15:43,636 --> 00:15:45,504
Right. Uh...

269
00:15:45,537 --> 00:15:47,874
Hey, I'm... I'm Kurt.
I'm here for Brenda.

270
00:15:47,907 --> 00:15:49,474
I figured.

271
00:15:49,508 --> 00:15:52,144
Otherwise I'd be, you
know, calling the police.

272
00:15:52,177 --> 00:15:54,714
Yeah.

273
00:15:54,747 --> 00:15:58,283
I'm Jenny Jo.
The mom.

274
00:15:58,317 --> 00:16:00,118
Nice to meet you.

275
00:16:00,152 --> 00:16:01,587
Kind of you
to fix the radio.

276
00:16:02,822 --> 00:16:04,456
It was my pleasure.

277
00:16:09,862 --> 00:16:12,832
Brenda? Is that the guy?
He's cute.

278
00:16:12,865 --> 00:16:14,333
Mom, can you
please just...

279
00:16:14,366 --> 00:16:15,500
And he's so nice.

280
00:16:15,534 --> 00:16:17,870
- I know. Okay, now you can go. Thank you.
- Yes. Okay.

281
00:16:17,904 --> 00:16:19,304
Uh, radio's fixed.

282
00:16:21,473 --> 00:16:24,610
Thanks. Um...
We keep one in every room in the house.

283
00:16:24,644 --> 00:16:27,546
It helps Zack.
Look, can I just be blunt?

284
00:16:27,579 --> 00:16:28,815
Is there another option?

285
00:16:28,848 --> 00:16:30,248
How do you know
where I live?

286
00:16:30,282 --> 00:16:31,316
The bartender
at the bar.

287
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:32,885
And why are you here?

288
00:16:32,919 --> 00:16:34,620
Well, I wanted to
meet your kids.

289
00:16:34,654 --> 00:16:36,756
You seemed so passionate
about them last night.

290
00:16:36,789 --> 00:16:37,857
And I also wanted
to give you this.

291
00:16:39,591 --> 00:16:40,592
Oh.

292
00:16:42,795 --> 00:16:44,864
Look, I have to get Zack
to physical therapy so...

293
00:16:44,897 --> 00:16:45,898
Physical therapy?

294
00:16:47,499 --> 00:16:49,568
He's legally blind,
and...

295
00:16:52,304 --> 00:16:53,740
He's on his own journey.

296
00:16:53,773 --> 00:16:55,374
Hmm.

297
00:16:55,407 --> 00:16:57,442
I hadn't really
noticed that.

298
00:16:57,476 --> 00:16:59,177
It was really nice
to meet you, Zack.

299
00:16:59,211 --> 00:17:00,212
Yeah.

300
00:17:02,581 --> 00:17:03,683
I'll see you around.

301
00:17:12,825 --> 00:17:13,826
Hey.

302
00:17:14,927 --> 00:17:16,328
My number.

303
00:17:16,361 --> 00:17:17,930
So, maybe call
next time?

304
00:17:20,499 --> 00:17:21,500
Where's your car?

305
00:17:23,002 --> 00:17:24,403
I walked.

306
00:17:24,436 --> 00:17:26,571
From UNI?
That's like three miles.

307
00:17:26,605 --> 00:17:27,606
Oh, yeah.

308
00:17:28,573 --> 00:17:29,642
Totally worth it.

309
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:50,830
Come on, Tanner.
Doubles, doubles, go.

310
00:17:51,596 --> 00:17:52,765
Hut!

311
00:17:56,836 --> 00:17:57,870
No!

312
00:17:59,304 --> 00:18:00,505
Punt!

313
00:18:00,539 --> 00:18:03,475
Tanner, come here. What are you doing?
First down's 25.

314
00:18:03,508 --> 00:18:05,377
Your job is to
move the chains.

315
00:18:06,813 --> 00:18:09,314
Come on, boys,
we've done this a thousand times before.

316
00:18:09,347 --> 00:18:10,750
Hey, Coach.

317
00:18:10,783 --> 00:18:12,250
Put me in and
I can win for you.

318
00:18:13,618 --> 00:18:16,321
Come on.
Coach, come on.

319
00:18:16,354 --> 00:18:18,658
- "UNI" on three. One, two, three.
- UNI!

320
00:18:18,691 --> 00:18:19,826
You're
back on the bench

321
00:18:19,859 --> 00:18:22,729
for the same reason you sat
on the bench for four years.

322
00:18:22,762 --> 00:18:24,864
What is your
problem with me, Coach?

323
00:18:24,897 --> 00:18:26,398
You want me to
sum it up for ya,

324
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:27,934
why you are
such a tragedy?

325
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:31,603
- You don't stay in the pocket.
- What?

326
00:18:31,637 --> 00:18:33,405
You got the talent,
loads of it.

327
00:18:33,438 --> 00:18:35,675
But when things
get hard, you bail.

328
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:36,943
You run from
adversity.

329
00:18:36,976 --> 00:18:39,879
You don't trust your
team or my playbook.

330
00:18:39,912 --> 00:18:41,346
You don't deserve
to play in the game.

331
00:18:41,379 --> 00:18:43,750
Coach, 10 more games
and my dream is gone.

332
00:18:43,783 --> 00:18:46,284
I've been working my whole
life for this. Please.

333
00:18:46,318 --> 00:18:48,755
You need to start thinking
about life after football, son.

334
00:18:48,788 --> 00:18:52,524
Respectfully,
you are wrong, Coach.

335
00:18:52,557 --> 00:18:54,827
I'm not gonna quit,
because that's not what leaders do.

336
00:18:54,861 --> 00:18:56,896
I just need to know
how to get on that field.

337
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,934
Blue 80, hut!

338
00:19:06,538 --> 00:19:07,606
Again.

339
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,641
Hut!

340
00:19:14,947 --> 00:19:17,415
You could throw.
But you cannot leave the pocket.

341
00:19:17,449 --> 00:19:18,951
You want your shot?
You take the pain.

342
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,921
Hurry up!

343
00:19:21,954 --> 00:19:22,989
Blue 80, hut!

344
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:29,095
Oh, no, no, no.
Don't you fumble my football.

345
00:19:29,128 --> 00:19:30,830
You hold onto my football.

346
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:32,698
Again!

347
00:19:32,732 --> 00:19:33,933
Again.

348
00:19:36,068 --> 00:19:37,737
I said, "Again".

349
00:19:39,604 --> 00:19:40,673
Again.

350
00:19:42,642 --> 00:19:44,342
How many more times
we gonna do this, Coach?

351
00:19:44,376 --> 00:19:46,913
As many times as I say.
Who else wants to kill Kurt?

352
00:19:46,946 --> 00:19:48,714
I do.

353
00:19:48,748 --> 00:19:50,348
Hudnutt,
you're on offense.

354
00:19:50,382 --> 00:19:51,918
I'll switch for
this, though, baby.

355
00:19:53,385 --> 00:19:54,854
Somebody give me a purple jersey.
Come on.

356
00:20:00,059 --> 00:20:01,093
Hello?

357
00:20:01,127 --> 00:20:03,896
<i>Hey, there.
I'm startin' next week.</i>

358
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:05,631
<i>It's Kurt,
by the way. Warner.</i>

359
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:08,134
<i>You get my messages?</i>

360
00:20:08,167 --> 00:20:09,869
Yeah. All of them.

361
00:20:09,902 --> 00:20:12,404
<i>See? I called first.
That's good, right?</i>

362
00:20:12,437 --> 00:20:13,538
<i>What do you say?</i>

363
00:20:13,572 --> 00:20:14,874
<i>Monday night,
let's go on a date.</i>

364
00:20:16,008 --> 00:20:17,677
What are we
gonna do? Walk?

365
00:20:18,711 --> 00:20:19,846
<i>Is that a yes?</i>

366
00:20:20,913 --> 00:20:22,347
<i>'Cause it sounds
like a yes.</i>

367
00:20:23,216 --> 00:20:24,884
<i>I think you're trying
to say yes.</i>

368
00:20:32,024 --> 00:20:33,793
What are you doing?

369
00:20:33,826 --> 00:20:34,894
Got us a ride.

370
00:20:34,927 --> 00:20:36,729
Kurt, I have kids.
You should've called first.

371
00:20:36,762 --> 00:20:39,397
I did call. You hung up on
me, don't you remember?

372
00:20:39,431 --> 00:20:41,466
God, you're insane.

373
00:20:42,802 --> 00:20:44,369
I saw that smile!

374
00:20:44,904 --> 00:20:45,905
Yep.

375
00:20:48,473 --> 00:20:49,507
Hey, kids...

376
00:20:51,711 --> 00:20:53,612
You ever been
out here before?

377
00:20:53,646 --> 00:20:55,915
- No, it's real pretty.
- Yeah.

378
00:20:58,483 --> 00:20:59,618
Real peaceful, too.

379
00:20:59,652 --> 00:21:01,120
It's one of my favorite
places to come.

380
00:21:07,927 --> 00:21:09,862
- I dig your tattoo.
- Yeah?

381
00:21:10,963 --> 00:21:13,633
<i>Semper fidelis.</i>
It's the motto of...

382
00:21:13,666 --> 00:21:15,600
For the Marines,
yeah. Yeah.

383
00:21:15,635 --> 00:21:17,036
I saw the pictures
on your mantle.

384
00:21:20,106 --> 00:21:21,107
When...

385
00:21:22,675 --> 00:21:26,712
When I was maybe
12, after church...

386
00:21:28,114 --> 00:21:30,016
this woman comes up
to me and says...

387
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:33,418
"There's something special about
you, Brenda."

388
00:21:35,221 --> 00:21:37,156
"God is gonna do
something great with you."

389
00:21:38,523 --> 00:21:39,591
And...

390
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:47,599
I had the audacity
to believe her.

391
00:21:47,633 --> 00:21:54,173
So, I had this dream of being
a Marine and marrying a Marine,

392
00:21:54,206 --> 00:21:56,842
and having little
Marine children

393
00:21:56,876 --> 00:22:00,112
and God, country,
and Corps all the way.

394
00:22:00,146 --> 00:22:02,181
So, I signed up
right outta high school.

395
00:22:03,816 --> 00:22:04,917
Wow.

396
00:22:04,951 --> 00:22:05,985
Then, I met Brad.

397
00:22:07,585 --> 00:22:09,021
My perfect Marine.

398
00:22:10,156 --> 00:22:13,893
Whirlwind romance,
marriage...

399
00:22:16,028 --> 00:22:18,164
and Zack was born
a year later.

400
00:22:19,231 --> 00:22:22,001
And what happened
to Brad?

401
00:22:24,569 --> 00:22:27,173
He cheated on me when I was
eight months pregnant with Jesse.

402
00:22:27,206 --> 00:22:28,473
Oh... What?

403
00:22:29,008 --> 00:22:30,109
So, um...

404
00:22:31,744 --> 00:22:33,879
Yeah. I have
some trust issues.

405
00:22:36,949 --> 00:22:38,550
Was Zack born blind?

406
00:22:39,118 --> 00:22:40,119
No.

407
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:42,088
He wasn't.

408
00:22:45,691 --> 00:22:48,761
I got this call
from Brad

409
00:22:49,996 --> 00:22:52,631
when Zack was
four months old.

410
00:22:52,665 --> 00:22:55,968
He said,
"He's breathing funny."

411
00:22:57,670 --> 00:23:01,774
And I still remember
the panic in his voice.

412
00:23:03,042 --> 00:23:04,844
And I rushed
to the hospital...

413
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:10,182
where we were told
his brain was swelling

414
00:23:10,216 --> 00:23:13,152
and that he'd be lucky to
make it through the night.

415
00:23:14,653 --> 00:23:16,621
And they had no idea
what was wrong 'cause...

416
00:23:21,827 --> 00:23:28,167
'Cause Brad didn't tell us,
not for 24 hours...

417
00:23:32,738 --> 00:23:34,907
that he accidentally
dropped Zack.

418
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:37,043
On his head.
In the tub.

419
00:23:37,643 --> 00:23:38,644
Oh...

420
00:23:43,349 --> 00:23:45,851
Could've been different, you
know, if he'd just told the truth.

421
00:23:48,954 --> 00:23:50,956
I remember

422
00:23:53,292 --> 00:23:56,128
praying and praying

423
00:23:56,162 --> 00:24:00,900
and begging God
to just save my baby boy.

424
00:24:04,937 --> 00:24:10,810
So, the doctor told me he'd never
walk, and yet...

425
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:13,913
That he'd never talk,

426
00:24:13,946 --> 00:24:16,282
and now,
I can't get him to stop.

427
00:24:20,386 --> 00:24:21,987
That he'd never be
a black truck driver.

428
00:24:23,355 --> 00:24:25,623
He keeps finding a way
to prove everyone wrong.

429
00:24:26,692 --> 00:24:27,927
He's...

430
00:24:28,661 --> 00:24:29,829
He's my miracle.

431
00:24:32,898 --> 00:24:37,336
That all seems pretty, uh,
important to you in your life.

432
00:24:37,369 --> 00:24:38,370
Religion and God.

433
00:24:40,272 --> 00:24:44,810
Yeah, it's more like
a relationship for me...

434
00:24:45,878 --> 00:24:48,180
and, yes, it defines me.

435
00:24:52,051 --> 00:24:55,888
And that lady who came up
and talked to you at church

436
00:24:55,921 --> 00:24:57,823
all those years ago,
you still believe her?

437
00:24:58,924 --> 00:25:01,093
I'm trying.

438
00:25:02,695 --> 00:25:04,096
I'm a work
in progress.

439
00:25:10,302 --> 00:25:11,704
This is where you
bring all your girls?

440
00:25:11,737 --> 00:25:13,806
Oh,
are you my girl now?

441
00:25:13,839 --> 00:25:15,074
No.

442
00:25:15,107 --> 00:25:16,408
- <i>Hey, there.</i>
- <i>Hey.</i>

443
00:25:17,743 --> 00:25:18,944
You just come
with me.

444
00:25:18,978 --> 00:25:21,013
Hi. Good to
see you again.

445
00:25:21,046 --> 00:25:22,214
- Yes, good to see you.
- Kurt, this is my dad.

446
00:25:22,248 --> 00:25:24,183
- Hey, there.
- Hello, sir, pleasure to meet you.

447
00:25:24,216 --> 00:25:25,851
- I want Grandma.
- Yeah?

448
00:25:25,885 --> 00:25:27,052
He's cute.

449
00:25:27,086 --> 00:25:30,022
- Oh, will you stop?
- Please, I'm married.

450
00:25:30,055 --> 00:25:31,790
- That's my sister.
- Nice to meet ya.

451
00:25:33,225 --> 00:25:36,395
Uh, hey, Dad,
could you give us a minute?

452
00:25:37,863 --> 00:25:40,399
It's my garage.
I wasn't finished yet.

453
00:25:42,268 --> 00:25:44,036
All right.

454
00:25:44,069 --> 00:25:47,206
Okay, I'm trying to imagine a
scenario where any of this works.

455
00:25:47,239 --> 00:25:49,208
- What, exactly?
- You know, us.

456
00:25:49,241 --> 00:25:51,076
Oh, we're an "us" now.
That's good news.

457
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:52,878
This is crazy.
This isn't gonna work.

458
00:25:52,912 --> 00:25:54,046
You keep saying that.

459
00:25:54,079 --> 00:25:55,281
I just can't, I mean...

460
00:26:06,058 --> 00:26:07,159
So, tomorrow night?

461
00:26:07,193 --> 00:26:08,994
- Yep.
- All right.

462
00:26:12,231 --> 00:26:14,066
Get set! Get set! Get set!

463
00:26:15,935 --> 00:26:18,837
Three-sixty!
One-sixty! Hut, hut!

464
00:26:28,414 --> 00:26:29,782
Hey, hey.

465
00:26:29,815 --> 00:26:32,284
How does it feel to make out with
a future professional athlete?

466
00:26:32,318 --> 00:26:33,886
It was better
before you said that.

467
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,388
Sixty, hut.

468
00:26:42,795 --> 00:26:44,763
Hut!

469
00:26:46,365 --> 00:26:49,168
Again. Let's go again.
Come on, right now, let's go.

470
00:26:51,837 --> 00:26:55,207
<i>Kurt Warner has
been absolutely on fire today.</i>

471
00:26:56,475 --> 00:26:58,410
<i>There's been
a growing buzz</i>

472
00:26:58,444 --> 00:27:02,948
<i>that this kid may be a dark
horse in this year's NFL draft.</i>

473
00:27:02,982 --> 00:27:04,850
<i>I was voted
Gateway Player of the Year</i>

474
00:27:04,883 --> 00:27:06,218
and our team was
first in conference.

475
00:27:08,354 --> 00:27:11,890
<i>Look,
it's rare that a 1-AA player gets drafted.</i>

476
00:27:14,193 --> 00:27:15,527
<i>But let's see
what we can do.</i>

477
00:27:15,561 --> 00:27:18,264
Thank you!
Yes! I promise...

478
00:27:18,297 --> 00:27:21,000
<i>Okay, gotta grab this.
Look forward to it, buddy.</i>

479
00:27:21,033 --> 00:27:22,401
- Yes!
- I got an agent!

480
00:27:22,434 --> 00:27:24,536
- Let's go!
- I got an agent!

481
00:27:35,481 --> 00:27:37,182
Hey.

482
00:27:42,955 --> 00:27:45,958
Hey. Draft day.

483
00:27:45,991 --> 00:27:47,359
How do you feel?
Are you nervous?

484
00:27:47,393 --> 00:27:49,561
Yeah, no, I feel good.
I just want my chance, you know.

485
00:27:49,595 --> 00:27:53,132
Yeah. Yeah, of course.
Who's this?

486
00:27:53,165 --> 00:27:55,434
Oh, yeah, Mom,
so, this is Brenda.

487
00:27:55,467 --> 00:27:58,037
- And this is her son, Zack.
- Hi.

488
00:27:59,371 --> 00:28:00,572
Hi, it's nice to meet you.

489
00:28:03,309 --> 00:28:07,146
<i>The Bengals have selected Dan
Wilkinson, defensive tackle,</i>

490
00:28:07,179 --> 00:28:09,315
- <i>Ohio State University.</i>
- Pick Kurt. Pick Kurt.

491
00:28:09,348 --> 00:28:10,916
Okay, shh,
sweetheart.

492
00:28:10,949 --> 00:28:12,117
No, no, hey,
it's okay.

493
00:28:12,151 --> 00:28:13,185
It's okay.

494
00:28:13,218 --> 00:28:14,953
I probably won't get picked
until tomorrow, though.

495
00:28:15,487 --> 00:28:16,488
Tomorrow?

496
00:28:18,157 --> 00:28:19,892
Yeah, there's seven
rounds of picks

497
00:28:19,925 --> 00:28:22,127
that are spread out
over two days,

498
00:28:22,161 --> 00:28:25,397
so, if I get picked, when I get
picked, it'll be in the later rounds.

499
00:28:25,431 --> 00:28:27,299
Kurt, it's Zack's birthday
tomorrow, remember?

500
00:28:27,333 --> 00:28:28,500
We're havin' a party
at the house?

501
00:28:28,534 --> 00:28:29,902
Birthday.
It's my birthday.

502
00:28:29,935 --> 00:28:31,136
No, no, no,
it'll be fine, Brenda.

503
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:32,137
You guys can
start the party,

504
00:28:32,171 --> 00:28:33,305
and then I'll just join
as soon as this is over.

505
00:28:33,339 --> 00:28:36,075
And then, we can all celebrate
together, you know?

506
00:28:36,575 --> 00:28:38,043
Right.

507
00:28:38,077 --> 00:28:40,913
<i>That was something
that had been debated for weeks.</i>

508
00:28:40,946 --> 00:28:43,650
<i>If Seattle would've said, "Hey,
Cortez Kennedy, 27 other teams,</i>

509
00:28:43,683 --> 00:28:45,284
<i>"he's out there
for a trade."</i>

510
00:28:45,317 --> 00:28:47,386
<i>What kind of offers would
they have gotten in return?</i>

511
00:28:47,419 --> 00:28:49,321
Bye, Kurt.

512
00:28:49,355 --> 00:28:50,989
Bye, Z-Man.
Bye, Brenda.

513
00:28:51,023 --> 00:28:52,024
Drive safe.

514
00:29:00,599 --> 00:29:02,434
You sure you're good
driving me back?

515
00:29:03,268 --> 00:29:04,470
Ain't
a problem.

516
00:29:07,373 --> 00:29:08,941
You sure
that's a good idea?

517
00:29:09,942 --> 00:29:11,009
What?

518
00:29:12,311 --> 00:29:15,381
Single mom, two kids.
That's no joke.

519
00:29:16,415 --> 00:29:17,416
I would know.

520
00:29:19,084 --> 00:29:20,519
Is that really
the life you want?

521
00:29:25,958 --> 00:29:27,694
Yay.

522
00:29:27,727 --> 00:29:29,161
Who wants cake?

523
00:29:29,194 --> 00:29:30,295
- I do.
- Yes!

524
00:29:30,329 --> 00:29:31,463
- Got a fork? Okay, good.
- He's got a fork.

525
00:29:31,497 --> 00:29:34,032
Okay, here you
go, honey.

526
00:29:34,066 --> 00:29:36,235
Another piece of cake
comin' right up for you.

527
00:29:36,268 --> 00:29:37,302
Great.

528
00:29:46,545 --> 00:29:48,313
Uh-huh.

529
00:29:49,148 --> 00:29:50,282
Happy birthday,
Zack.

530
00:29:50,717 --> 00:29:51,818
Want cake?

531
00:29:51,851 --> 00:29:53,986
Come on, well,
you're just in time for the cake.

532
00:29:54,019 --> 00:29:56,255
- Yeah.
- You made it just in time.

533
00:30:00,459 --> 00:30:01,393
I'm sorry.

534
00:30:01,427 --> 00:30:04,163
Mama,
I can't wait to eat mine.

535
00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:06,965
How's it taste?

536
00:30:06,999 --> 00:30:08,400
- Good.
- I bet real sugary, huh?

537
00:30:10,602 --> 00:30:12,104
How do you feel?
Older?

538
00:30:24,183 --> 00:30:25,551
I was wondering
where you were.

539
00:30:26,552 --> 00:30:27,687
Hey.

540
00:30:33,592 --> 00:30:35,027
You wanna
talk to me?

541
00:30:39,531 --> 00:30:41,366
I'm just wondering why
God would give me a dream

542
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,168
that's probably never
gonna come true.

543
00:30:43,202 --> 00:30:46,004
'Cause I just feel like
that's cruel, you know?

544
00:30:51,443 --> 00:30:53,512
Babe, you know what, I just want...
I just want my shot.

545
00:30:53,545 --> 00:30:54,647
I... I just...

546
00:30:54,681 --> 00:30:57,516
I want one chance,
so I can prove...

547
00:30:57,549 --> 00:30:58,550
Prove what?

548
00:31:02,454 --> 00:31:04,189
Prove that I'm good
enough, that's what.

549
00:31:08,527 --> 00:31:11,664
I don't think a football
game is ever gonna do that.

550
00:31:15,334 --> 00:31:17,135
It doesn't have
to define you.

551
00:31:21,674 --> 00:31:23,275
If this is
your dream,

552
00:31:23,308 --> 00:31:25,010
you have to go
fight for it.

553
00:31:27,613 --> 00:31:30,182
So, how do you think the Bears
are gonna do this year, son?

554
00:31:31,851 --> 00:31:34,453
Well, they just
fired Ditka,

555
00:31:34,486 --> 00:31:36,689
so things are probably gonna
get worse before they...

556
00:31:40,592 --> 00:31:41,728
- Did they call?
- Hmm?

557
00:31:41,761 --> 00:31:42,662
Are you kidding me?

558
00:31:42,695 --> 00:31:43,930
Did somebody from the
Bears call here today?

559
00:31:43,963 --> 00:31:47,299
No, the Bears didn't call,
buddy, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

560
00:31:48,333 --> 00:31:50,302
No.

561
00:31:51,403 --> 00:31:52,437
The Packers called.

562
00:31:53,405 --> 00:31:54,573
- They wanna sign you.
- Come on.

563
00:31:54,606 --> 00:31:55,642
- No, they do.
- Come on!

564
00:31:56,843 --> 00:31:58,076
Oh, wow.

565
00:31:58,110 --> 00:31:59,211
Congratulations.

566
00:32:04,116 --> 00:32:07,586
A $5,000 signing bonus, baby!
Pretty great, huh?

567
00:32:07,619 --> 00:32:09,321
Thank you so much.

568
00:32:09,354 --> 00:32:10,589
It is green.

569
00:32:10,622 --> 00:32:12,190
The Packers. Green Bay. Get it?

570
00:32:12,224 --> 00:32:13,292
Yeah, we get it.

571
00:32:14,259 --> 00:32:15,327
Packers for life.

572
00:32:18,163 --> 00:32:20,165
- That's why she's green.
- Yeah, we get it, man.

573
00:32:24,436 --> 00:32:25,437
Hey.

574
00:32:26,071 --> 00:32:29,107
I don't wanna
leave you.

575
00:32:29,141 --> 00:32:31,844
- I don't wanna leave you.
- Oh.

576
00:32:31,878 --> 00:32:34,479
<i>You ever feel like your whole
life was just leadin' up to one moment?</i>

577
00:32:36,281 --> 00:32:37,482
Then go make
the most of it.

578
00:32:39,551 --> 00:32:40,552
Hey.

579
00:32:41,587 --> 00:32:42,855
Hey, you okay?

580
00:32:42,889 --> 00:32:44,089
Yeah.

581
00:32:44,657 --> 00:32:46,592
I'm happy for you,

582
00:32:46,626 --> 00:32:48,795
but I know that this
is gonna change things.

583
00:32:48,828 --> 00:32:50,630
Your life is gonna
get busier, and...

584
00:32:50,663 --> 00:32:52,431
Hey, Brenda, Brenda,
Brenda, it's okay.

585
00:32:53,465 --> 00:32:54,566
We'll figure it out.

586
00:32:56,168 --> 00:32:57,569
Yeah. We'll figure it out.

587
00:33:05,410 --> 00:33:07,245
- I miss you already.
- Me, too.

588
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:08,480
- I'll call you when I get...
- You drive safe.

589
00:33:08,513 --> 00:33:10,482
I will. I'll call you
when I get there.

590
00:33:10,515 --> 00:33:12,317
- Packers for life!
- You better.

591
00:33:31,403 --> 00:33:32,404
Wow.

592
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:34,641
Wow.

593
00:33:48,655 --> 00:33:49,689
Step and throw.

594
00:34:04,737 --> 00:34:05,738
Move! Move!

595
00:34:07,006 --> 00:34:08,407
Yeah, good ball.

596
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:09,909
Nice ball.
Thataway, Brett.

597
00:34:09,942 --> 00:34:11,944
Thataway to zip it
in there.

598
00:34:11,978 --> 00:34:13,545
Hey, Pop.
Pop Warner.

599
00:34:14,647 --> 00:34:15,782
Let's see
what you got.

600
00:34:19,952 --> 00:34:21,420
Did you hear what I said?
You're in.

601
00:34:21,453 --> 00:34:23,588
Uh, yeah, Coach,
I just got here.

602
00:34:23,622 --> 00:34:24,824
I don't know
the playbook yet.

603
00:34:24,857 --> 00:34:26,659
- You don't wanna go in?
- I do wanna go in.

604
00:34:26,693 --> 00:34:27,860
I just don't wanna
blow it out there.

605
00:34:27,894 --> 00:34:30,797
- Give me till tomorrow, I'll know it.
- Detner, you're in.

606
00:34:39,005 --> 00:34:40,605
Hey, you wanted
to see me, Coach?

607
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:42,307
Yeah, thanks for
comin' in, Warner.

608
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:43,375
Hey...

609
00:34:44,342 --> 00:34:45,377
wish you well.

610
00:34:46,646 --> 00:34:47,680
Wait, what?

611
00:34:47,714 --> 00:34:48,781
We're letting you go.

612
00:34:48,815 --> 00:34:51,483
No, no, you're letting me go?
No. I just got here.

613
00:34:51,516 --> 00:34:52,919
You haven't even
seen me play yet.

614
00:34:52,952 --> 00:34:54,619
Well, we tried.

615
00:34:54,654 --> 00:34:56,321
No, I'm sorry, sir,
but I'm not gonna leave.

616
00:34:56,354 --> 00:34:57,790
Not yet.
You can't cut me.

617
00:34:57,824 --> 00:34:59,491
- You cut yourself, okay?
- Coach, please.

618
00:34:59,524 --> 00:35:01,694
I have been working
for this my entire life.

619
00:35:01,728 --> 00:35:04,262
Stop it. Come on.
Don't do that.

620
00:35:04,296 --> 00:35:05,965
If it were true, you would've
been ready to go on the field.

621
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,401
You're not.

622
00:35:11,336 --> 00:35:12,437
I'm gonna need
that playbook.

623
00:35:27,787 --> 00:35:30,322
<i>I just don't know
what to do, Brenda.</i>

624
00:35:30,355 --> 00:35:33,358
<i>I've called every team in the
NFL, and no one's interested.</i>

625
00:35:33,391 --> 00:35:34,861
<i>I wanna go on, I do.</i>

626
00:35:34,894 --> 00:35:36,896
But, I mean,
look at me.

627
00:35:38,597 --> 00:35:40,800
I'm unemployed.
I'm homeless.

628
00:35:42,501 --> 00:35:43,636
Oh. Right,

629
00:35:43,669 --> 00:35:46,438
I forgot to tell you that
Hudnutt's movin' to Des Moines.

630
00:35:47,807 --> 00:35:50,308
Then move in.

631
00:35:52,511 --> 00:35:53,545
What?

632
00:35:53,578 --> 00:35:54,947
With us.
My family.

633
00:35:57,784 --> 00:36:00,452
With nursing school starting,
I could use a live-in nanny.

634
00:36:01,654 --> 00:36:03,790
We're both gonna
be struggling, so...

635
00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:06,893
Why don't we
struggle together?

636
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:09,629
Yeah, together.

637
00:36:10,963 --> 00:36:12,564
What is your mom
gonna think?

638
00:36:13,699 --> 00:36:15,802
It's your mom
I'm worried about.

639
00:36:15,835 --> 00:36:17,036
That woman
hates me.

640
00:36:19,404 --> 00:36:20,472
I mean, she...

641
00:36:21,007 --> 00:36:22,041
I mean...

642
00:36:25,443 --> 00:36:28,380
Oh, come on, man.
Just throw the dang ball.

643
00:36:28,948 --> 00:36:30,016
Football.

644
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:32,417
That's right, Z-Man.

645
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:34,386
You like it?

646
00:36:35,021 --> 00:36:36,088
You play.

647
00:36:37,790 --> 00:36:40,793
Yeah, I'd really like to,
bud, but they didn't pick me.

648
00:36:42,527 --> 00:36:43,696
I pick you.

649
00:36:51,771 --> 00:36:53,471
I pick you too, bud.

650
00:37:14,559 --> 00:37:15,628
$27.12.

651
00:37:18,698 --> 00:37:19,866
Yeah.

652
00:37:23,903 --> 00:37:26,038
Uh, you take
food stamps?

653
00:37:26,072 --> 00:37:28,941
Mmm-hmm. Anything else for ya?

654
00:37:28,975 --> 00:37:29,976
No. That's...

655
00:37:31,777 --> 00:37:34,714
Uh, actually, yeah.

656
00:37:34,747 --> 00:37:36,414
Um, can I get, uh...

657
00:37:37,850 --> 00:37:39,384
Can I get one of
your applications?

658
00:37:39,785 --> 00:37:40,887
Yeah.

659
00:38:03,910 --> 00:38:04,911
Hey, Mama.

660
00:38:06,846 --> 00:38:09,514
- I got a job today.
- Yeah?

661
00:38:09,547 --> 00:38:13,219
Yeah.
Stockin' shelves at the Hy-Vee.

662
00:38:13,252 --> 00:38:14,619
Graveyard shift.

663
00:38:16,856 --> 00:38:18,190
It's just for
a little while.

664
00:38:19,859 --> 00:38:21,794
Until next season's tryouts.

665
00:38:24,562 --> 00:38:25,497
You know
what they say.

666
00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:27,934
"Sometimes you gotta do
what you gotta do,

667
00:38:27,967 --> 00:38:30,870
"until you can do what
you want to do," you know?

668
00:38:38,010 --> 00:38:39,912
Don't give up.

669
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:03,669
It's Kurt Warner.

670
00:39:08,107 --> 00:39:09,108
Go Panthers.

671
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:20,052
- I gotta get to class.
- Hey.

672
00:39:20,086 --> 00:39:22,554
Pray for me.
We're learning how to insert an IV.

673
00:39:22,587 --> 00:39:23,823
I'll be home by 7:00.
Date night?

674
00:39:23,856 --> 00:39:25,623
No, my shift starts
at 6:30.

675
00:39:25,658 --> 00:39:27,159
Oh. Sorry.

676
00:39:29,295 --> 00:39:30,562
Okay.

677
00:39:59,125 --> 00:40:00,126
Think you'd be
that guy?

678
00:40:03,062 --> 00:40:04,730
Yeah, I do.

679
00:40:04,764 --> 00:40:07,299
What are you doin' here?
Get it done.

680
00:40:07,333 --> 00:40:08,868
Yeah, 'cause
it's that easy.

681
00:40:09,335 --> 00:40:10,669
Oh, nice hands.

682
00:40:11,037 --> 00:40:12,038
Oh.

683
00:40:13,906 --> 00:40:14,907
Go long.

684
00:40:15,741 --> 00:40:16,742
Go long.

685
00:40:17,209 --> 00:40:18,210
Set! Hut!

686
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,215
Ow.

687
00:40:29,288 --> 00:40:30,990
Come on, man.

688
00:40:31,023 --> 00:40:32,725
Yeah, yeah,
I got it.

689
00:40:41,934 --> 00:40:43,302
Kurt Warner.

690
00:40:43,335 --> 00:40:45,938
I've been looking
everywhere for you.

691
00:40:45,971 --> 00:40:49,175
Jim Foster. It is my absolute
pleasure to meet you.

692
00:40:49,208 --> 00:40:50,242
And you are?

693
00:40:50,276 --> 00:40:53,045
- Brenda.
- Pleasure to meet you.

694
00:40:53,079 --> 00:40:55,314
Can I sit?
Look, elephant in the room,

695
00:40:55,347 --> 00:40:57,083
I am sorry
about the draft...

696
00:40:58,150 --> 00:40:59,952
and the Packers.

697
00:40:59,985 --> 00:41:01,821
But you got it all, kid.
The whole package.

698
00:41:01,854 --> 00:41:03,789
The world just needs
more time to see it.

699
00:41:03,823 --> 00:41:05,391
Well, thank you.
See, this guy gets it.

700
00:41:05,424 --> 00:41:07,827
Yes, I get it.
And what if I told you,

701
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:10,996
starting tomorrow,
you have a job playing the game you love?

702
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:13,332
- What are you, a scout or something?
- No.

703
00:41:13,365 --> 00:41:17,770
I'm the proud owner and head
coach of the Iowa Barnstormers.

704
00:41:17,803 --> 00:41:20,940
The newest members of
the Arena Football League.

705
00:41:20,973 --> 00:41:24,276
Right. You're the guy who came
up with this whole arena concept.

706
00:41:24,310 --> 00:41:26,145
Last year,
I was commissioner of the league.

707
00:41:26,178 --> 00:41:28,180
This year, I came home to
Iowa to start my own team

708
00:41:28,214 --> 00:41:29,682
and I wanna
build it around you.

709
00:41:30,749 --> 00:41:32,651
So, it's arena football?

710
00:41:32,685 --> 00:41:35,154
No, it is not football, babe.
It's like a circus.

711
00:41:35,187 --> 00:41:37,690
Yes, that's right. You get it.
People love the circus.

712
00:41:37,723 --> 00:41:39,725
- I like the circus.
- Hey, hey.

713
00:41:39,758 --> 00:41:42,394
I am gonna play football,
and I'm gonna play it in the NFL.

714
00:41:42,428 --> 00:41:46,165
And I can't do that if I'm playing
arena football in the spring.

715
00:41:46,198 --> 00:41:49,135
This is for guys that are,
you know, circling the drain.

716
00:41:51,237 --> 00:41:54,940
I'll tell you what,
just think about it.

717
00:41:56,008 --> 00:41:57,710
Get him to
think about it.

718
00:41:57,743 --> 00:41:59,912
Here's my card. Oops.

719
00:41:59,945 --> 00:42:01,080
Dropped a little
money there.

720
00:42:10,055 --> 00:42:12,057
Brenda, it's all the way
in Des Moines.

721
00:42:13,025 --> 00:42:14,326
And it's not football.

722
00:42:17,363 --> 00:42:19,832
Hell, I don't know!
You're the agent.

723
00:42:19,865 --> 00:42:21,433
What happened
to Tampa Bay?

724
00:42:21,467 --> 00:42:23,035
San Diego?
There were other offers.

725
00:42:23,068 --> 00:42:24,270
Can't you just
make some calls?

726
00:42:24,303 --> 00:42:26,005
<i>Kurt,
that was last year.</i>

727
00:42:26,038 --> 00:42:28,207
<i>Look, the teams
have moved on.</i>

728
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:30,776
<i>I just don't see
a path forward here.</i>

729
00:42:30,809 --> 00:42:33,045
<i>I'm sorry.
I gotta grab this.</i>

730
00:42:33,078 --> 00:42:34,346
- <i>Take care of yourself.</i>
- No, no...

731
00:42:37,850 --> 00:42:40,419
- Hey, Kurt, can I borrow you a second?
- Yeah.

732
00:42:40,452 --> 00:42:41,954
Yeah,
one minute.

733
00:42:42,922 --> 00:42:44,723
All right, Z-Man.

734
00:42:44,757 --> 00:42:46,425
<i>We bought
our dream home, son.</i>

735
00:42:46,458 --> 00:42:49,361
Down in Arkansas.
It's closer to Jenny's family.

736
00:42:50,362 --> 00:42:52,965
And, uh,
oh, it's great.

737
00:42:52,998 --> 00:42:57,903
It's a brand-new ranch home.
Two-car garage.

738
00:42:59,505 --> 00:43:02,107
And it's right down the
road from the White River.

739
00:43:02,141 --> 00:43:04,376
And there's some good fishin' in
there, buddy...

740
00:43:04,410 --> 00:43:06,879
So...

741
00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:09,315
Well, we'll be
leavin' soon.

742
00:43:09,348 --> 00:43:11,083
And, um,
the thing is...

743
00:43:11,116 --> 00:43:12,918
We need to find
a new place to live.

744
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:16,855
Well, I'm glad to
hear you say "we."

745
00:43:20,326 --> 00:43:24,430
Look, uh, Jenny Jo would
want me to ask you this.

746
00:43:24,463 --> 00:43:28,434
I mean, a good Christian
family, after all, and, uh...

747
00:43:31,270 --> 00:43:32,871
- Do you love her?
- Yes, sir.

748
00:43:34,373 --> 00:43:35,374
I do.

749
00:43:36,375 --> 00:43:37,476
I knew you did.

750
00:43:40,946 --> 00:43:42,781
Do you mind me asking
what's holding you up?

751
00:43:44,883 --> 00:43:45,918
That's okay.

752
00:43:45,951 --> 00:43:48,120
No, no, no.

753
00:43:49,088 --> 00:43:50,422
That's fine. Um...

754
00:43:54,093 --> 00:43:57,363
I guess I just felt like I
needed to prove myself first.

755
00:43:58,564 --> 00:44:03,068
Show her I was capable of
doing what I set out to do.

756
00:44:04,436 --> 00:44:06,105
Be worthy of her.

757
00:44:06,138 --> 00:44:08,374
Well, hell, Kurt.

758
00:44:08,407 --> 00:44:10,075
Accomplishing one thing
or the other

759
00:44:10,109 --> 00:44:12,111
is not what's gonna
make you worthy of her.

760
00:44:12,945 --> 00:44:15,381
Life is not about
what you can achieve,

761
00:44:15,414 --> 00:44:16,982
it's about what
you can become.

762
00:44:18,284 --> 00:44:20,819
It's a journey, son.
It's not an event.

763
00:44:22,021 --> 00:44:24,356
Just promise me this.

764
00:44:24,390 --> 00:44:28,127
You won't take off
when things get hard.

765
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:29,795
And they will get hard.

766
00:44:31,897 --> 00:44:32,931
Yes, sir.

767
00:44:35,134 --> 00:44:37,002
Take care of
these kids for me.

768
00:44:40,072 --> 00:44:41,206
Well, that's a guarantee.

769
00:44:42,441 --> 00:44:43,442
I know.

770
00:44:58,758 --> 00:45:01,994
<i>A major blizzard caused
accidents across the Midwest, Monday,</i>

771
00:45:02,027 --> 00:45:04,096
<i>and the dangerous
blast of arctic air</i>

772
00:45:04,129 --> 00:45:06,965
<i>is expected to spread across
the region overnight.</i>

773
00:45:06,999 --> 00:45:09,902
<i>Record-breaking low temperatures
will make the next few days</i>

774
00:45:09,935 --> 00:45:13,572
<i>the coldest the region has
seen in at least 25 years.</i>

775
00:45:18,177 --> 00:45:20,045
Hey. How's the fever?

776
00:45:22,014 --> 00:45:23,515
The same.

777
00:45:23,549 --> 00:45:25,384
What happened to the heat?
Did we pay the bill?

778
00:45:25,417 --> 00:45:28,020
I don't know, Kurt. You told me not
to put it in the mail, remember?

779
00:45:29,254 --> 00:45:31,623
Damn it.

780
00:45:31,658 --> 00:45:34,193
Maybe we should just go to my
mom's till the storm passes.

781
00:45:35,628 --> 00:45:36,796
Hey.

782
00:45:36,830 --> 00:45:38,964
I decided, I'm droppin' out of
school, gettin' a job.

783
00:45:38,997 --> 00:45:40,899
What? No. No, no, no. No way.

784
00:45:40,933 --> 00:45:43,936
Kurt, it's not working.
Nothing here is working.

785
00:45:43,969 --> 00:45:46,372
Stop. Stop it.

786
00:45:46,405 --> 00:45:49,441
Listen, if this is what you really
wanna do, I'm not gonna let you quit.

787
00:45:49,475 --> 00:45:50,943
Because that's what
you did for me,

788
00:45:50,976 --> 00:45:52,177
and that's what we do
for each other.

789
00:45:52,211 --> 00:45:54,913
We are not quitting.
Do you understand?

790
00:45:56,215 --> 00:45:57,316
Okay?

791
00:45:59,652 --> 00:46:00,653
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

792
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:09,428
It's bad out here.

793
00:46:12,732 --> 00:46:14,333
Maybe we should
head back home.

794
00:46:17,603 --> 00:46:19,338
- Oh, Kurtis?
- Uh...

795
00:46:30,249 --> 00:46:31,950
Baby, we just
ran outta gas.

796
00:46:34,654 --> 00:46:37,589
Okay, all right, there's a...
There's a gas station

797
00:46:37,623 --> 00:46:38,624
a couple miles back.

798
00:46:38,658 --> 00:46:41,493
That was...
That was more than a couple of miles.

799
00:46:41,527 --> 00:46:42,995
It's okay, it's okay,
it's okay.

800
00:46:43,028 --> 00:46:45,297
I can make it there.
No problem. No problem.

801
00:46:45,330 --> 00:46:47,332
- Just grab the change outta the door.
- Yep.

802
00:46:47,366 --> 00:46:49,201
And check the
glove compartment, too.

803
00:46:49,234 --> 00:46:50,670
Yep. Here's some.

804
00:46:50,703 --> 00:46:53,605
I got a couple
dollars in my wallet here.

805
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:55,407
- Here's another quarter.
- All right, here.

806
00:46:57,509 --> 00:46:58,544
- Stay inside.
- Uh-huh.

807
00:46:58,577 --> 00:47:01,180
- Stay warm. Keep the doors shut.
- Yeah, be fast.

808
00:47:15,127 --> 00:47:16,228
Excuse me, hi.

809
00:47:16,261 --> 00:47:20,532
Uh, $4.86 on pump three,
and do you have any gas cans?

810
00:47:20,566 --> 00:47:23,268
- Uh, yeah, 5 bucks.
- Oh, no, no, no.

811
00:47:23,302 --> 00:47:25,337
I... I don't need to buy one,
I just need to borrow one.

812
00:47:25,370 --> 00:47:26,405
I'll bring it right back.

813
00:47:28,641 --> 00:47:30,008
Please, please.

814
00:47:31,076 --> 00:47:32,978
- All right.
- Thank you. Thank you.

815
00:48:12,852 --> 00:48:14,520
- Hey. Hey.
- Kurt...

816
00:48:14,553 --> 00:48:16,154
I'm so sorry,
are you okay?

817
00:48:21,728 --> 00:48:23,328
Let's get you
all warmed up.

818
00:48:31,503 --> 00:48:33,138
<i>Brenda,
I'm so sorry.</i>

819
00:48:33,171 --> 00:48:34,606
<i>You all could have
died out there.</i>

820
00:48:36,575 --> 00:48:38,510
<i>It's not
your fault, Kurt.</i>

821
00:48:38,544 --> 00:48:40,078
Yeah, it is
my fault.

822
00:48:41,814 --> 00:48:45,652
I promised your father that I would
take care of you and the kids.

823
00:48:47,754 --> 00:48:49,521
So that is exactly
what I'm gonna do.

824
00:49:04,169 --> 00:49:06,438
Fifty yards long.
Eight-yard end zones.

825
00:49:06,471 --> 00:49:08,373
Eight men each side.

826
00:49:08,407 --> 00:49:09,842
This is not
a football field.

827
00:49:09,876 --> 00:49:13,378
This is an arena.
For gladiators.

828
00:49:13,412 --> 00:49:16,315
For true believers
and lovers of the game.

829
00:49:16,348 --> 00:49:18,718
And right over here
is our sideline.

830
00:49:18,751 --> 00:49:22,354
In our version of the game,
the sideline is a wall.

831
00:49:22,387 --> 00:49:24,256
And it will pound you
and punish you.

832
00:49:24,824 --> 00:49:26,091
Trust me.

833
00:49:29,696 --> 00:49:30,730
Kurt Warner.

834
00:49:32,699 --> 00:49:36,301
So, did hell freeze over or are you
just tired of waiting on the NFL?

835
00:49:38,771 --> 00:49:41,607
Uh, bit of both, sir.

836
00:49:41,641 --> 00:49:44,576
Forget everything you think
you know about football.

837
00:49:44,610 --> 00:49:47,847
No punts, no turning back.
It's all pressure.

838
00:49:49,214 --> 00:49:51,818
It's football at
the speed of NASCAR.

839
00:49:51,851 --> 00:49:54,453
We call it
"the 50-yard indoor war."

840
00:49:54,486 --> 00:49:56,188
You think you can
handle that, Warner?

841
00:49:57,890 --> 00:49:59,291
I think it's time I tried.

842
00:49:59,859 --> 00:50:01,293
All right, Red.

843
00:50:04,931 --> 00:50:08,701
Well, well, well,
look who's still circling the drain.

844
00:50:08,735 --> 00:50:10,803
What's up, boy?

845
00:50:10,837 --> 00:50:12,537
All right,
all right, all right.

846
00:50:13,773 --> 00:50:16,208
Well, Kurt, if we gonna go down,

847
00:50:16,241 --> 00:50:17,542
might as well
go down together.

848
00:50:19,444 --> 00:50:20,445
Set!

849
00:50:21,380 --> 00:50:22,414
Faster, faster.

850
00:50:22,447 --> 00:50:23,883
Pull the trigger.
Come on, Warner.

851
00:50:23,916 --> 00:50:25,818
Ooh, that'll wake you up
in the morning, boy.

852
00:50:25,852 --> 00:50:27,219
- Get out of here.
- You gotta watch it.

853
00:50:27,252 --> 00:50:28,821
Get outta here.

854
00:50:28,855 --> 00:50:30,389
You gotta get rid
of the ball, Warner.

855
00:50:30,422 --> 00:50:32,224
You look like you're
movin' in slow motion.

856
00:50:32,257 --> 00:50:33,392
Set!

857
00:50:33,425 --> 00:50:36,328
One, two, three, throw.
One, two, three, throw. Come on!

858
00:50:37,429 --> 00:50:41,333
Pain feels good, don't it?
Pain feels good, baby!

859
00:50:44,937 --> 00:50:46,939
Oh, you can't
touch me, boy.

860
00:50:46,973 --> 00:50:48,373
You can't
touch me, boy.

861
00:50:48,407 --> 00:50:49,608
Whatever.
Whatever.

862
00:50:49,642 --> 00:50:50,810
Man, it's fast.

863
00:50:52,477 --> 00:50:53,846
Yeah, you'll get
used to it.

864
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:55,915
Uh, if this is
where we practice,

865
00:50:57,249 --> 00:50:58,617
where on earth
do we play?

866
00:51:04,657 --> 00:51:06,859
Hey. Hey, Hud.
What is that?

867
00:51:07,794 --> 00:51:09,361
Oh, that's
the Rodeo Arena.

868
00:51:09,394 --> 00:51:12,632
Rare cattle, cuttin' horse
shows, pony shows.

869
00:51:12,665 --> 00:51:13,900
Them pony shows
is fresh.

870
00:51:14,801 --> 00:51:16,703

<i>The Iowa Barnstormers!</i>

875
00:51:28,881 --> 00:51:30,482
They call it
the Barn.

876
00:51:30,515 --> 00:51:31,818
Let's go, 1-3!

877
00:51:37,857 --> 00:51:40,893

the wall into his own bench.</i>

00:51:58,845 --> 00:52:01,948
<i>And we got our first fight of the night!</i>

884
00:52:01,981 --> 00:52:04,416
That's a good end.
That was a good end.

885
00:52:04,449 --> 00:52:07,285
<i>A quick slant to Corn
Willis in the middle of the field.</i>

886
00:52:07,319 --> 00:52:08,821
<i>And he goes in
for the touchdown.</i>

887
00:52:08,855 --> 00:52:10,022
God help me.

888
00:52:10,056 --> 00:52:11,858
On one, ready!

889
00:52:11,891 --> 00:52:13,826
<i>And that will bring out
a new face.</i>

890
00:52:13,860 --> 00:52:16,729
<i>Kurt Warner from the
University of Northern Iowa.</i>

891
00:52:16,763 --> 00:52:19,932
<i>He had quite a reputation for being
a gunslinger with the Panthers.</i>

892
00:52:19,966 --> 00:52:22,635
<i>Let's see if he's got any
of that cowboy still in him.</i>

893
00:52:28,908 --> 00:52:30,676
Oh, boy,
that moves fast.

894

- Snap it, snap it, snap it!
- <i>Stewart in motion</i>

the snap off in time.</i>

896
00:52:35,047 --> 00:52:36,682
<i>Unbelievable.</i>

897
00:52:36,716 --> 00:52:38,450
Get him outta here!

898
00:52:39,952 --> 00:52:42,354
Trips left. No.
Uh, trips right.

899
00:52:42,387 --> 00:52:43,656
50 double,

900
00:52:43,689 --> 00:52:45,792

lemon law on quarterbacks?

00:52:57,637 --> 00:53:00,405
What are you doing?

906
00:53:01,707 --> 00:53:02,909
Warner, that way.

907
00:53:02,942 --> 00:53:04,509
Not that way.

908
00:53:04,911 --> 00:53:06,411
Ball there.

909
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:08,815

What are you doin' in that extra beat?
Balancing your checkbook? Come on, man.

918
00:53:35,675 --> 00:53:38,678
You don't have time enough to
drop back and settle like that.

919
00:53:38,711 --> 00:53:40,146
It's faster than that.
You just gotta pick it up.

00:54:34,499 --> 00:54:36,702
<i>And it's Smallbone,

That's a touchdown
bonus.

953

954
00:55:09,969 --> 00:55:12,838
I also pay you to win.
Did you even read your contract?

955
00:55:12,872 --> 00:55:13,906
Teach him
to read, man.

956
00:55:18,210 --> 00:55:21,546
Wait, really, $100
every single touchdown?

957
00:55:21,579 --> 00:55:22,748
Every touchdown.
Happy to pay it.

958
00:55:24,784 --> 00:55:26,018

00:55:53,646 --> 00:55:55,848
It was epic.
Hey, you gettin' my salary checks, right?

969
00:55:55,881 --> 00:55:57,083
I told 'em to send 'em
straight to you.

980
00:56:19,138 --> 00:56:21,707

You all enjoy

1006
00:57:43,856 --> 00:57:45,958
Yeah, that was great.
You were amazing out there.

1007
00:57:45,991 --> 00:57:47,993
Good. Got a long
drive home.

1008
00:57:48,027 --> 00:57:49,328
I'm sorry.
We need to get by through here.

1009
00:57:49,361 --> 00:57:50,563
We're here
to see Kurt.

1010
00:57:50,595 --> 00:57:52,665
You need a wristband, ma'am.
For the meet and greet.

1011
00:57:52,698 --> 00:57:54,233
Oh, no, no, no.
We're with Kurt.

1012
00:57:54,266 --> 00:57:55,901
Yeah, you
and everyone else.

1013
00:57:55,935 --> 00:57:57,136
No, we're
his family. Um...

1014
00:57:57,169 --> 00:58:01,107
Look, I've got our tickets right
here, and I just need to...

1015
00:58:01,140 --> 00:58:02,842
You still need
a wristband.

1016
00:58:03,776 --> 00:58:04,844
Zack?

1017
00:58:06,412 --> 00:58:08,681
Zack!
Sir, excuse me.

1018
00:58:08,714 --> 00:58:11,383
Zack? Zack?
Excuse me.

1019
00:58:17,890 --> 00:58:19,291
Oh, my God!

1020
00:58:19,325 --> 00:58:21,293
<i>Brenda, I didn't even know
you guys were gonna be here.</i>

1021
00:58:21,327 --> 00:58:22,428
<i>I thought
you had to study.</i>

1022
00:58:22,461 --> 00:58:25,097
Well, that's why it's
called a "surprise", Kurt.

1023
00:58:25,131 --> 00:58:26,665
Okay, then why
are you upset?

1024
00:58:26,699 --> 00:58:28,767
Because...

1025
00:58:28,801 --> 00:58:30,936
I couldn't get to you,
and it felt like everyone else could.

1026
00:58:30,970 --> 00:58:32,304
And then I lost Zack...

1027
00:58:32,338 --> 00:58:34,440
Because I didn't know you were
coming, but, hey, babe, we won.

1028
00:58:34,473 --> 00:58:36,375
We're going to
the semi-finals.

1029
00:58:36,408 --> 00:58:37,910
I know. It was just
supposed to be different.

1030
00:58:37,943 --> 00:58:39,645
Yo, Kurt, party at
our place tonight.

1031
00:58:43,749 --> 00:58:45,451
- Hey, Bren.
- Hud.

1032
00:58:45,484 --> 00:58:46,886
I don't have to
go to that.

1033
00:58:46,919 --> 00:58:48,654
We've got
a long drive home.

1034
00:58:52,424 --> 00:58:54,426
How's my baby girl?

1035
00:58:54,460 --> 00:58:57,696
<i>Just fine.
How are you?</i>

1036
00:58:57,730 --> 00:59:01,033
Just waiting on tonight.
Sunday night movie night.

1037
00:59:01,867 --> 00:59:03,269
Miss watching with you.

1038
00:59:04,370 --> 00:59:07,339
<i>So, what does
"just fine" mean?</i>

1039
00:59:07,373 --> 00:59:08,440
You know...

1040
00:59:09,108 --> 00:59:10,176
Just...

1041
00:59:11,844 --> 00:59:12,878
fine.

1042
00:59:13,779 --> 00:59:15,114
<i>And how's Kurt?</i>

1043
00:59:18,784 --> 00:59:19,818
Far away.

1044
00:59:24,790 --> 00:59:25,791
Hey.

1045
00:59:27,259 --> 00:59:28,928
Uh, no kids?

1046
00:59:31,197 --> 00:59:32,231
No kids.

1047
00:59:33,299 --> 00:59:35,000
Do you wanna go
grab some lunch?

1048
00:59:35,034 --> 00:59:36,869
Could we sit and talk
for a few minutes?

1049
00:59:37,903 --> 00:59:38,904
Yeah, sure.

1050
00:59:40,906 --> 00:59:42,107
Come on in.

1051
00:59:42,141 --> 00:59:43,342
<i>What's on
your mind?</i>

1052
00:59:44,910 --> 00:59:46,412
I have a question
and I'm just...

1053
00:59:47,479 --> 00:59:49,381
gonna say it
and get it out.

1054
00:59:51,083 --> 00:59:52,751
I want you to know
that I'm not angry.

1055
00:59:52,785 --> 00:59:54,119
I just need
an honest answer.

1056
00:59:55,955 --> 00:59:57,990
Uh, okay.

1057
00:59:58,023 --> 01:00:00,292
Do you see yourself
in my life, long-term?

1058
01:00:01,327 --> 01:00:04,396
I mean, watching
Zack grow up,

1059
01:00:04,430 --> 01:00:07,166
walking Jesse
down the aisle.

1060
01:00:07,199 --> 01:00:10,436
Standing by my side at my
parents' 50th anniversary.

1061
01:00:10,469 --> 01:00:12,805
Do you honestly
see yourself there?

1062
01:00:15,474 --> 01:00:17,876
Okay. 'Cause I've had
a lot of time to think...

1063
01:00:17,910 --> 01:00:19,778
Wait, wait, wait.
Let me answer your question.

1064
01:00:19,812 --> 01:00:21,046
Kurt, you already did.

1065
01:00:21,547 --> 01:00:24,083
I'm happy for you.

1066
01:00:24,116 --> 01:00:27,253
For everything that's
going on in your life.

1067
01:00:28,821 --> 01:00:30,789
But it's not working
for my life.

1068
01:00:30,823 --> 01:00:33,359
- Brenda, you...
- Can you please just let me finish?

1069
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:37,263
I've been through this
before, you know that.

1070
01:00:37,296 --> 01:00:39,098
And I can't do it again.

1071
01:00:40,199 --> 01:00:42,101
So...

1072
01:00:42,134 --> 01:00:44,570
why don't we just
skip to that part,

1073
01:00:44,603 --> 01:00:46,472
and save ourself a
lot of time and tears?

1074
01:00:46,505 --> 01:00:48,140
So... So...

1075
01:00:49,942 --> 01:00:51,510
Help me understand this.
What, exactly?

1076
01:00:51,543 --> 01:00:52,911
We're just supposed
to end it now,

1077
01:00:52,945 --> 01:00:54,146
so we don't have
to end it later?

1078
01:00:54,179 --> 01:00:56,148
- Yes.
- Why?

1079
01:00:56,181 --> 01:00:58,083
Because you can't decide.
You won't...

1080
01:00:58,117 --> 01:01:00,319
Oh, oh, oh... Oh, no, no,
you don't get to pin that on me.

1081
01:01:00,352 --> 01:01:01,954
No, sorry.
You're the one who's afraid.

1082
01:01:01,987 --> 01:01:03,022
Yes, I'm afraid.

1083
01:01:03,055 --> 01:01:06,258
Yes, you're afraid. Of what?
Of me bailin' on you?

1084
01:01:06,292 --> 01:01:07,459
Of me hurtin' you?

1085
01:01:07,493 --> 01:01:09,295
Me being some version
of your ex?

1086
01:01:09,328 --> 01:01:11,163
I'm afraid that we are
gonna hurt each other.

1087
01:01:11,196 --> 01:01:13,065
That is the only way
that this ends.

1088
01:01:13,098 --> 01:01:14,333
You don't know that!

1089
01:01:14,366 --> 01:01:16,902
Kurt, I want you to chase your
dreams, just not with me.

1090
01:01:35,187 --> 01:01:36,188
Okay.

1091
01:01:44,563 --> 01:01:46,298
- What is that?
- That's my touchdown money.

1092
01:01:47,599 --> 01:01:48,802
Are you paying me
to break up?

1093
01:01:48,834 --> 01:01:50,869
I'm pretty sure you're the one
breaking up with me right now.

1094
01:01:50,903 --> 01:01:52,137
It was a discussion.

1095
01:01:52,171 --> 01:01:54,206
It was a discussion and now it's
a decision, and you know what?

1096
01:01:58,177 --> 01:01:59,578
I get it.

1097
01:02:01,513 --> 01:02:03,582
I get it. You're right, Brenda.
You're always right.

1098
01:02:05,084 --> 01:02:06,251
We should just
end it now,

1099
01:02:06,285 --> 01:02:07,419
and just be done
with it, yeah.

1100
01:02:07,453 --> 01:02:08,987
I gotta get to the game,
because apparently,

1101
01:02:09,021 --> 01:02:10,322
that's the only thing
I'm any good at.

1102
01:02:10,356 --> 01:02:13,992
Anyway, drive safe.
Tell the kids I said hi.

1103
01:02:26,305 --> 01:02:28,374
Left,
50 Pogo, wide cross.

1104
01:02:29,541 --> 01:02:30,810
Warner!

1105
01:02:30,844 --> 01:02:34,246
Left, 50
Pogo, wide cross. Come on, man.

1106
01:02:36,982 --> 01:02:39,084
Left, 50 Pogo,
wide cross. Ready?

1107
01:02:41,253 --> 01:02:43,155
C-44, C-44!

1108
01:02:45,057 --> 01:02:46,091
Set, hut!

1109
01:02:52,297 --> 01:02:54,366
<i>That'll do it.
With time running out,</i>

1110
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:57,136
<i>that touchdown will seal
the win for Coach Foster.</i>

1111
01:02:57,169 --> 01:03:02,141
<i>The Iowa Barnstormers are heading
to the Arena Bowl to face Tampa Bay.</i>

1112
01:03:08,347 --> 01:03:10,082
Shouldn't you
be celebrating?

1113
01:03:10,115 --> 01:03:13,118
I mean,
what do you think this is? Come on.

1114
01:03:13,152 --> 01:03:14,353
Oh, God.

1115
01:03:16,155 --> 01:03:17,222
Yeah.

1116
01:03:24,563 --> 01:03:26,733
What?

1117
01:03:26,766 --> 01:03:30,068
That is not the face of somebody
that just made the Finals.

1118
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:35,007
Where's Brenda?

1119
01:03:37,443 --> 01:03:39,978
We, uh...

1120
01:03:40,612 --> 01:03:41,980
We broke up.

1121
01:03:49,621 --> 01:03:52,291
Winning doesn't always
feel like winning, no?

1122
01:03:54,092 --> 01:03:55,160
It never has.

1123
01:03:59,097 --> 01:04:00,265
Why is that?

1124
01:04:03,068 --> 01:04:04,704
Guess it doesn't
mean anything

1125
01:04:04,737 --> 01:04:06,405
when you don't have
someone to share it with.

1126
01:04:07,674 --> 01:04:09,341
She should
be here, Kurt.

1127
01:04:09,374 --> 01:04:10,643
It's wrong
that she isn't.

1128
01:04:11,577 --> 01:04:13,378
I thought you
didn't like her.

1129
01:04:13,412 --> 01:04:15,514
No... No, I just...

1130
01:04:17,249 --> 01:04:19,318
I just saw too much
of myself in her.

1131
01:04:22,087 --> 01:04:24,490
I didn't want you to struggle
the way that I struggled.

1132
01:04:29,394 --> 01:04:31,698
But my story doesn't
have to be her story.

1133
01:04:34,566 --> 01:04:35,735
You love her.

1134
01:04:37,269 --> 01:04:38,337
You stuck with her.

1135
01:04:39,338 --> 01:04:40,472
With those kids.

1136
01:04:43,141 --> 01:04:45,410
You have grown up
to be a good man.

1137
01:04:47,379 --> 01:04:48,781
She makes you
happy, Kurt.

1138
01:04:49,414 --> 01:04:50,582
I've seen it.

1139
01:04:53,185 --> 01:04:54,286
She makes you better.

1140
01:05:00,192 --> 01:05:02,662
<i>Hi, again.
Sports Center hippin' you to what's up.</i>

1141
01:05:02,695 --> 01:05:03,763
<i>Alongside Steve Levy,</i>

1142
01:05:03,796 --> 01:05:05,063
<i>I'm Stuart Scott.</i>

1143
01:05:05,097 --> 01:05:06,431
<i>Coming up, in addition
to the items already mentioned,</i>

1144
01:05:06,465 --> 01:05:09,769
<i>Mark will narrate this. I'm sure
he'll put it in proper perspective.</i>

1145
01:05:09,802 --> 01:05:11,738
<i>Raiders head coach
Jon Gruden says...</i>

1146
01:05:13,205 --> 01:05:14,239
Hello?

1147
01:05:14,273 --> 01:05:16,709
<i>Kurt.
Kurt.</i>

1148
01:05:16,743 --> 01:05:18,577
Brenda, what's wrong?

1149
01:05:18,610 --> 01:05:21,280
<i>Kurt,
oh, my God, my parents...</i>

1150
01:05:21,313 --> 01:05:23,448
<i>After the massive
amount of damage,</i>

1151
01:05:23,482 --> 01:05:25,785
<i>large trees are down
all over the area</i>

1152
01:05:25,818 --> 01:05:28,120
<i>and the street I'm looking at,</i>

1153
01:05:28,153 --> 01:05:31,557
<i>the entire block has been leveled
to the concrete foundations.</i>

1154
01:05:31,590 --> 01:05:33,425
<i>Category 4 tornado</i>

1155
01:05:33,458 --> 01:05:36,528
<i>that hit at about 7:45
last night...</i>

1156
01:06:04,156 --> 01:06:05,457
Brenda!

1157
01:06:05,490 --> 01:06:06,626
Kurt!

1158
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:10,830
Hey, hey.
I got you.

1159
01:06:10,863 --> 01:06:12,799
I'm right here,
okay?

1160
01:06:12,832 --> 01:06:14,634
How can this
be real?

1161
01:06:24,911 --> 01:06:26,445
I don't understand.

1162
01:06:30,449 --> 01:06:31,583
It's not fair.

1163
01:06:33,251 --> 01:06:35,822
I'm so
angry with you.

1164
01:06:39,859 --> 01:06:42,427
I'm so angry.

1165
01:06:51,203 --> 01:06:52,270
They're gone.

1166
01:06:54,206 --> 01:06:55,374
Really gone.

1167
01:07:01,848 --> 01:07:03,248
I'm just gonna
check on the kids.

1168
01:07:03,281 --> 01:07:04,751
No, no, hey,
I'll take care of that.

1169
01:07:05,752 --> 01:07:06,753
You stay.

1170
01:07:31,410 --> 01:07:32,745
I sure did
miss you, buddy.

1171
01:08:04,576 --> 01:08:07,647
God, help.
I need you.

1172
01:08:08,815 --> 01:08:09,982
I need you.

1173
01:08:25,798 --> 01:08:27,466
Hey, hey...

1174
01:08:28,467 --> 01:08:31,303
Hey, Z-Man.
Sorry, I didn't mean to wake you up.

1175
01:08:37,309 --> 01:08:38,376
I just miss 'em.

1176
01:08:39,746 --> 01:08:40,913
I miss them.

1177
01:08:42,648 --> 01:08:44,349
Yeah, we all
miss 'em.

1178
01:08:55,393 --> 01:08:56,829
- Wait just a second.
- Okay.

1179
01:08:56,863 --> 01:08:57,897
Okay, look.

1180
01:08:59,531 --> 01:09:00,733
The way
I see it,

1181
01:09:00,767 --> 01:09:02,501
I'm gonna remember this moment
for the rest of my life,

1182
01:09:02,534 --> 01:09:03,568
so if you're not...

1183
01:09:03,602 --> 01:09:04,670
Hey, Brenda.

1184
01:09:06,639 --> 01:09:07,840
I'm gonna be here.

1185
01:09:10,342 --> 01:09:11,543
I'm gonna be
right here.

1186
01:09:19,085 --> 01:09:20,585
I love you.

1187
01:09:20,619 --> 01:09:21,854
I love you, too.

1188
01:09:21,888 --> 01:09:23,856
- See you in a couple days, okay?
- Okay.

1189
01:09:25,057 --> 01:09:26,324
Bye,
sweetheart.

1190
01:09:29,662 --> 01:09:31,097
Thanks for
taking them.

1191
01:09:31,130 --> 01:09:32,765
I just... I need
a couple days.

1192
01:09:32,799 --> 01:09:35,600
Hey. Whenever you're ready,
we'll see you at home.

1193
01:09:35,635 --> 01:09:36,636
Okay?

1194
01:10:30,488 --> 01:10:33,125
Hey, guys.
Mama missed you so much.

1195
01:10:34,794 --> 01:10:37,395
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

1196
01:10:37,429 --> 01:10:38,530
Okay.

1197
01:10:39,031 --> 01:10:40,032
Come here.

1198
01:10:49,075 --> 01:10:52,377
All my life,
I've defined myself through sports.

1199
01:10:53,411 --> 01:10:55,948
What I could accomplish,
how many games I could win.

1200
01:10:57,016 --> 01:10:58,450
And I've always
come up empty.

1201
01:10:58,483 --> 01:10:59,652
It's never
been enough.

1202
01:11:00,987 --> 01:11:02,822
Like I was meant
for somethin' else.

1203
01:11:03,823 --> 01:11:04,924
Somethin' more.

1204
01:11:10,863 --> 01:11:11,931
What if it's this?

1205
01:11:14,133 --> 01:11:16,434
What if it's us?
Together?

1206
01:11:19,238 --> 01:11:24,010
Everything I could ever
want or need is right here.

1207
01:11:24,043 --> 01:11:26,746
It doesn't matter if I play football,
or if I don't play football,

1208
01:11:26,779 --> 01:11:28,648
or if I do play football,
where I play football.

1209
01:11:28,681 --> 01:11:29,882
None of that matters.

1210
01:11:29,916 --> 01:11:32,051
'Cause winning
isn't winning

1211
01:11:32,084 --> 01:11:33,953
if I don't have you
by my side.

1212
01:11:37,555 --> 01:11:38,758
I've made
my choice.

1213
01:11:51,971 --> 01:11:53,471
I love you.

1214
01:11:54,240 --> 01:11:56,842
And I want
what you have.

1215
01:11:56,876 --> 01:12:00,212
I want your faith, I want your
strength, I want it all. I need it.

1216
01:12:00,246 --> 01:12:02,081
I need it in my life.
It makes me a better man.

1217
01:12:02,114 --> 01:12:03,115
Yes.

1218
01:12:04,616 --> 01:12:06,484
You gotta wait till
I say the words first.

1219
01:12:06,518 --> 01:12:08,120
Well, then,
hurry up. God!

1220
01:12:12,124 --> 01:12:13,926
- Brenda Carney...
- Yes!

1221
01:12:13,960 --> 01:12:16,629
- You're not gonna let me finish?
- No!

1222
01:12:22,768 --> 01:12:23,736
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

1223
01:12:23,769 --> 01:12:26,739
on the first day
of the rest of their lives,

1224
01:12:26,772 --> 01:12:29,141
Mr. and Mrs. Kurt
and Brenda Warner.

1225
01:12:31,177 --> 01:12:32,812
Come on! Come on!

1226
01:12:45,291 --> 01:12:48,894
Hey, Warner.
We got Arena Bowl this weekend.

1227
01:12:48,928 --> 01:12:51,063
Arena Bowl. Are you all in?
Let's do it.

1228
01:12:51,097 --> 01:12:52,131
Wow.

1229
01:12:53,799 --> 01:12:56,769
This right here,
this is my "all in."

1230
01:13:01,741 --> 01:13:02,808
I love you.

1231
01:13:04,176 --> 01:13:06,178
Daddy, will you
dance with me?

1232
01:13:06,212 --> 01:13:07,246
Aw...

1233
01:13:07,279 --> 01:13:08,546
Yeah.

1234
01:13:17,289 --> 01:13:20,659
<i>♪ It was no accident</i>

1235
01:13:23,295 --> 01:13:26,799
<i>♪ Me finding you, Daddy</i>

1236
01:13:29,635 --> 01:13:33,305
<i>♪ Someone had a hand in it ♪</i>

1237
01:13:44,884 --> 01:13:46,452
It's okay.

1238
01:13:46,485 --> 01:13:49,889
<i>After 4 months and
16 games, it has come down to this.</i>

1239
01:13:49,922 --> 01:13:54,193
<i>A barn dance in Des Moines.
And they are rockin' and rollin' here</i>

1240
01:13:54,226 --> 01:13:57,163
<i>at the Veterans Auditorium
in Des Moines.</i>

1241
01:13:57,196 --> 01:13:59,231
<i>The defending champions
Tampa Bay Storm</i>

1242
01:13:59,265 --> 01:14:01,267
<i>against the Iowa Barnstormers.</i>

1243
01:14:01,300 --> 01:14:02,301
Hello, everyone.

1244
01:14:02,334 --> 01:14:04,637
Along with Kirk Herbstreit,
I am Todd Christensen.

1245
01:14:04,670 --> 01:14:06,338
Hey, Todd, Kirk.

1246
01:14:06,372 --> 01:14:08,641
Cleveland Stadium
has a Dawg Pound.

1247
01:14:08,674 --> 01:14:11,677
Veteran Memorial Stadium
has the Barnyard...

1248
01:14:11,710 --> 01:14:14,013
Let's keep this area
for the "different" people.

1249
01:14:15,147 --> 01:14:17,283
Whoo!

1250
01:14:17,316 --> 01:14:18,784
Hurry up, hurry up!

1251
01:14:18,818 --> 01:14:22,388
<i>The outcome.
Hear the momentum switching to Iowa here</i>

1252
01:14:22,421 --> 01:14:24,023
<i>as they drive
for a go-ahead score...</i>

1253
01:14:24,056 --> 01:14:28,094
<i>Twenty-sixth completion by Kurt Warner,
that too is an Arena Bowl record.</i>

1254
01:14:28,127 --> 01:14:31,097
<i>Warner, the ball is tipped.
The keeper is out of the length of catch.</i>

1255
01:14:31,130 --> 01:14:33,365
Yes!

1256
01:14:33,399 --> 01:14:35,935
Come on, come on!
Hurry up. Let's go.

1257
01:14:35,968 --> 01:14:37,770
<i>If you don't
keep contain on this guy,</i>

1258
01:14:37,803 --> 01:14:39,238
<i>he's gonna hurt ya.</i>

1259
01:14:39,271 --> 01:14:42,108
<i>If they want a championship,
this is where they have to earn it.</i>

1260
01:14:45,077 --> 01:14:46,378
Don't hold it.

1261
01:14:46,412 --> 01:14:47,947
- <i>He cocks and motions left...</i>
- Throw. Throw.

1262
01:14:47,980 --> 01:14:51,183
<i>Pump fakes, is able to
buy some time. He gets rid of it.</i>

1263
01:14:53,385 --> 01:14:55,988
<i>And it appears... No!</i>

1264
01:14:57,223 --> 01:15:00,659
<i>A little pressure right
in the face of Kurt Warner</i>

1265
01:15:00,693 --> 01:15:04,396
<i>and who would've thought, that on the
one-yard line that they couldn't get it in?</i>

1266
01:15:04,430 --> 01:15:06,132
<i>And they're gonna
look back at that,</i>

1267
01:15:06,165 --> 01:15:07,299
<i>you can see the pressure
applied there...</i>

1268
01:15:07,333 --> 01:15:09,235
It's okay,
we'll be fine.

1269
01:15:09,268 --> 01:15:11,904
<i>The Tampa Bay
Storm are the champions.</i>

1270
01:15:11,937 --> 01:15:13,105
- Thanks.
- There you go. Oh, my pleasure.

1271
01:15:13,139 --> 01:15:14,773
Thanks for coming out.
Sorry we didn't win.

1272
01:15:14,807 --> 01:15:15,808
Kurt?

1273
01:15:16,709 --> 01:15:18,177
Hey, Kurt?

1274
01:15:18,210 --> 01:15:20,079
Excuse us, Brenda.
There's a gentleman here to see you.

1275
01:15:20,112 --> 01:15:21,814
- Hey, do you want me to go?
- No, stay here, that's fine.

1276
01:15:21,847 --> 01:15:23,015
Heck of a game
for you, Kurt.

1277
01:15:23,048 --> 01:15:25,417
Well, thank you,
but it didn't help us win.

1278
01:15:25,451 --> 01:15:27,453
I hate to lose, sir.
I hate it for the team.

1279
01:15:27,486 --> 01:15:29,121
I'm David Gillis.

1280
01:15:29,155 --> 01:15:31,157
We've been trying
to reach you.

1281
01:15:31,190 --> 01:15:32,858
We want you to come
and try out for us.

1282
01:15:35,261 --> 01:15:36,262
Try out?

1283
01:15:39,465 --> 01:15:42,368
I've been putting off
his calls for a while.

1284
01:15:43,502 --> 01:15:45,337
Can you blame me?

1285
01:15:45,371 --> 01:15:46,739
I'm sorry,
who are you?

1286
01:15:47,273 --> 01:15:48,440
I'm with the Rams.

1287
01:15:57,216 --> 01:15:59,985
Dick, come on.

1288
01:16:02,388 --> 01:16:03,789
Dick, I mean...

1289
01:16:04,523 --> 01:16:05,791
I don't get it.

1290
01:16:06,425 --> 01:16:07,426
I like him.

1291
01:16:09,028 --> 01:16:11,163
- It's a hunch.
- It's arena football.

1292
01:16:11,197 --> 01:16:13,332
You think
that'll translate?

1293
01:16:13,365 --> 01:16:15,467
Character translates
anywhere, Mike.

1294
01:16:15,501 --> 01:16:17,269
GM sure likes
his price.

1295
01:16:17,303 --> 01:16:19,505
Our groundskeeper's gonna make
more than him this season.

1296
01:16:19,538 --> 01:16:22,875
John, this guy is old.
Slow as molasses.

1297
01:16:22,908 --> 01:16:25,411
And frankly, he's beneath the
standards of this franchise.

1298
01:16:26,912 --> 01:16:29,348
That's what people said
about me when I came here.

1299
01:16:30,382 --> 01:16:32,318
He got a howitzer
for a right arm, though.

1300
01:16:32,351 --> 01:16:34,720
There is no way this
guy makes the team.

1301
01:16:35,955 --> 01:16:37,022
No way.

1302
01:16:44,863 --> 01:16:45,864
I like him.

1303
01:17:05,584 --> 01:17:06,885
Split!

1304
01:17:11,490 --> 01:17:13,225
Through one.

1305
01:17:32,911 --> 01:17:34,780
All right, next group, let's go.

1306
01:17:39,451 --> 01:17:40,452
Set, hut!

1307
01:17:49,428 --> 01:17:51,530
Great way to sling it, Trent.
Good boy.

1308
01:17:57,269 --> 01:17:59,305
The Packers
called you up once.

1309
01:17:59,338 --> 01:18:01,073
Yes, sir.
A long time ago.

1310
01:18:01,106 --> 01:18:02,975
Ah. How long
did you last?

1311
01:18:04,209 --> 01:18:05,210
Not long enough.

1312
01:18:06,646 --> 01:18:07,846
Two days.

1313
01:18:08,881 --> 01:18:10,049
You lasted
two days.

1314
01:18:12,451 --> 01:18:13,552
Don't get too
comfortable.

1315
01:18:17,089 --> 01:18:19,892
All we're lookin' for,
gentlemen, is perfection.

1316
01:18:19,925 --> 01:18:22,061
Let's see how we did with
Trent Green on the C map.

1317
01:18:22,094 --> 01:18:23,195
One, two, three,
four, five.

1318
01:18:23,228 --> 01:18:24,396
Step and throw.
Very nice. Stop.

1319
01:18:24,430 --> 01:18:26,865
Now, Is, you know why he put
that ball right there, right?

1320
01:18:26,899 --> 01:18:28,067
That's to keep you
from gettin' hit.

1321
01:18:28,100 --> 01:18:30,436
That's to protect you. Very good.
Excellent ball placement.

1322
01:18:32,905 --> 01:18:35,607
Stop, stop. Torry, no.

1323
01:18:35,642 --> 01:18:38,143
You know that dig
is 15 in cut.

1324
01:18:38,177 --> 01:18:40,012
Not 14. Right? 15.

1325
01:18:40,045 --> 01:18:41,080
Don't mind
Coach Martz.

1326
01:18:41,113 --> 01:18:44,583
Let me know if you need anything.
I'm Isaac.

1327
01:18:44,616 --> 01:18:46,318
Yeah. Yeah, man,
I know who you are.

1328
01:18:46,352 --> 01:18:47,986
I'm Kurt.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

1329
01:18:48,020 --> 01:18:49,021
Nice to meet you.

1330
01:18:50,122 --> 01:18:51,590
Hey, Mike.

1331
01:18:51,623 --> 01:18:54,226
Have you put in
1-3 yet?

1332
01:18:58,097 --> 01:19:00,332
You wanna waste everybody's time?

1333
01:19:00,366 --> 01:19:01,600
All right, second
group, let's go.

1334
01:19:03,202 --> 01:19:04,870
Pop Warner, that's
you, let's go.

1335
01:19:08,407 --> 01:19:10,275
All right, let's see
some happy feet.

1336
01:19:13,946 --> 01:19:16,181
<i>Okay, let's watch
Kurt Warner.</i>

1337
01:19:16,215 --> 01:19:18,083
<i>How close to perfection
could we get this time?</i>

1338
01:19:18,117 --> 01:19:20,653
Step, throw, stop.
It's a wrong read.

1339
01:19:20,687 --> 01:19:22,588
It's a wrong damn read!
You're ahead of 'em.

1340
01:19:22,621 --> 01:19:24,223
You gotta hit 'em
in stride, Kurt.

1341
01:19:25,692 --> 01:19:27,259
Yes, sir.

1342
01:19:27,292 --> 01:19:29,461
"Yes, sir," with a grin.
Why the grin?

1343
01:19:29,495 --> 01:19:32,264
I don't know, Coach.
I was just...

1344
01:19:32,297 --> 01:19:35,267
I was curious as to why everybody
here in the NFL moves so slow.

1345
01:19:37,302 --> 01:19:39,371
Gentlemen,

1346
01:19:39,405 --> 01:19:42,441
I believe arena boy just
called every one of you slow.

1347
01:19:42,474 --> 01:19:47,647
So, we gonna end on that.
And on this, which is for Warner,

1348
01:19:47,680 --> 01:19:51,016
when he learns
to throw a spiral.

1349
01:19:51,049 --> 01:19:52,985
Mr. Trent Green.

1350
01:19:53,018 --> 01:19:54,953
You can break 'em
down and take 'em out.

1351
01:19:54,987 --> 01:19:56,656
Good night, gentlemen.

1352
01:19:56,689 --> 01:19:59,024
Ride it out, rook.
It's all part of the plan.

1353
01:19:59,992 --> 01:20:00,993
Ready?

1354
01:20:03,663 --> 01:20:06,565
C-57! C-57!

1355
01:20:08,033 --> 01:20:10,402
Blue 80! Blue 80.

1356
01:20:10,436 --> 01:20:12,471
Give me that ball.
Give me the ball.

1357
01:20:12,504 --> 01:20:15,207
What are you thinking?
How do you drop that?

1358
01:20:15,240 --> 01:20:17,142
That ain't on
the QB, Coach.

1359
01:20:17,176 --> 01:20:19,545
That man is risking his
life for you every snap!

1360
01:20:19,578 --> 01:20:22,448
And you don't have the dignity
to hold on to the damn ball?

1361
01:20:24,016 --> 01:20:25,350
You hold on
to this ball.

1362
01:20:27,085 --> 01:20:29,354
Yes, sir. That's my mistake.
It won't happen again.

1363
01:20:36,528 --> 01:20:38,130
All right,
let's run it again.

1364
01:20:39,732 --> 01:20:41,233
We good.

1365
01:20:41,266 --> 01:20:44,737
<i>I don't know, Brenda, I don't
think I'm gonna be here much longer.</i>

1366
01:20:44,771 --> 01:20:45,939
<i>How do you
know that?</i>

1367
01:20:45,971 --> 01:20:48,641
The offensive coordinator hates me.
I can't prove myself.

1368
01:20:48,675 --> 01:20:50,609
He won't let me.
I'm not gettin' any snaps.

1369
01:20:50,643 --> 01:20:52,444
- <i>Hates you?</i>
- Yeah, no, he hates me.

1370
01:20:54,313 --> 01:20:56,348
I mean, this is Trent Green's
team, anyway.

1371
01:20:56,381 --> 01:20:58,584
They built it around him
and he's incredible.

1372
01:20:58,617 --> 01:21:00,185
<i>Babe, hang in there.</i>

1373
01:21:00,219 --> 01:21:01,754
Hey, Warner,
Coach wants to see you upstairs.

1374
01:21:07,794 --> 01:21:09,561
- I gotta go.
- <i>I love you.</i>

1375
01:21:10,697 --> 01:21:12,064
I love you, too.

1376
01:21:23,710 --> 01:21:25,143
- You wanted to see me, sir?
- Oh.

1377
01:21:25,678 --> 01:21:26,679
Yes.

1378
01:21:32,819 --> 01:21:35,053
How long for you in the
wilderness, son?

1379
01:21:39,759 --> 01:21:41,193
How long
out of college?

1380
01:21:43,696 --> 01:21:47,466
Right. Well, yeah, I mean, it's, uh...
it's been a few years.

1381
01:21:47,499 --> 01:21:48,534
Wow.

1382
01:21:48,567 --> 01:21:50,837
But, sir, that doesn't mean
that I don't know how...

1383
01:21:50,870 --> 01:21:52,104
Fourteen.

1384
01:21:52,839 --> 01:21:54,106
For me.

1385
01:21:54,841 --> 01:21:56,475
Fourteen years
outta coaching.

1386
01:21:59,211 --> 01:22:02,180
I burnt out.
I'm not embarrassed to say it.

1387
01:22:02,214 --> 01:22:04,717
Took a year off,
turned out to be a decade and a half.

1388
01:22:05,350 --> 01:22:06,385
And when I did
come back,

1389
01:22:06,418 --> 01:22:11,390
they said I was a retread,
has-been, too old.

1390
01:22:13,325 --> 01:22:15,494
Game had passed me
by, all that stuff.

1391
01:22:15,527 --> 01:22:17,630
All that same stuff

1392
01:22:17,664 --> 01:22:19,398
that they're gonna
say about you.

1393
01:22:25,237 --> 01:22:26,405
What they didn't know...

1394
01:22:28,206 --> 01:22:32,277
was all that experience
that I had in those years

1395
01:22:32,311 --> 01:22:35,180
made me who I am.

1396
01:22:37,215 --> 01:22:39,351
Made me ready
for this moment.

1397
01:22:40,753 --> 01:22:43,088
Gave me something
others didn't have.

1398
01:22:46,291 --> 01:22:48,728
And I see that
in you, Kurt.

1399
01:22:51,296 --> 01:22:52,364
Destiny.

1400
01:22:55,635 --> 01:22:57,436
It belongs
to the underdogs.

1401
01:22:59,438 --> 01:23:00,740
You wanna prove that?

1402
01:23:01,908 --> 01:23:03,175
Together?

1403
01:23:10,415 --> 01:23:13,385
There's somethin' special
about you, son.

1404
01:23:13,418 --> 01:23:17,189
And I'm really gonna enjoy
finding out what that is.

1405
01:23:17,222 --> 01:23:18,658
Welcome to the Rams.

1406
01:23:18,691 --> 01:23:21,560
Come on. Come on!

1407
01:23:22,629 --> 01:23:24,563
Oh, my gosh!

1408
01:23:24,596 --> 01:23:27,432
Oh, Coach, thank you.
Thank you for trusting me.

1409
01:23:27,466 --> 01:23:29,501
I gotta tell my wife.
I gotta tell my wife.

1410
01:23:29,534 --> 01:23:31,904
This is the best decision
you've ever made in your life.

1411
01:23:31,938 --> 01:23:33,873
I promise you.
I gotta go tell my wife.

1412
01:23:50,455 --> 01:23:51,724
Guys, I'm home.

1413
01:23:57,262 --> 01:23:58,631
Zack?

1414
01:23:58,665 --> 01:24:00,565
Zack, honey, no!
No, no, no!

1415
01:24:00,599 --> 01:24:02,367
Hey, baby, baby,
Brenda, it's okay.

1416
01:24:02,401 --> 01:24:04,637
It's okay, it's okay, come here.
Sit with me.

1417
01:24:06,271 --> 01:24:07,272
Sit down.

1418
01:24:11,978 --> 01:24:13,512
Why would you
let him do that?

1419
01:24:16,615 --> 01:24:17,917
He said
he was ready.

1420
01:24:20,385 --> 01:24:21,553
And I believed him.

1421
01:24:24,924 --> 01:24:27,459
Mom, I'm driving!

1422
01:24:27,492 --> 01:24:28,828
Yeah, you are, bud!

1423
01:24:44,844 --> 01:24:45,845
Come on, Charles!

1424
01:24:45,878 --> 01:24:48,280
<i>Trent Green,
ninth-rated passer</i>

1425
01:24:48,313 --> 01:24:51,951
<i>with 81.8% quarterback
rating in 1998,</i>

1426
01:24:51,984 --> 01:24:53,285
<i>the real hope
for this offense.</i>

1427
01:24:53,318 --> 01:24:56,956
<i>We've been talking about him all
game and all through season long...</i>

1428
01:24:57,824 --> 01:24:58,991
Hey, check it out.

1429
01:25:00,292 --> 01:25:01,593
That's my boy.

1430
01:25:01,627 --> 01:25:03,495
This might be the only
screen time he gets, though.

1431
01:25:03,528 --> 01:25:04,596
Boy, shut up.

1432
01:25:06,465 --> 01:25:08,567
<i>...to number 18,
Tony Small, the rookie's...</i>

1433
01:25:08,600 --> 01:25:10,302
- <i>Whoa!
- We have a scorer.</i>

1434
01:25:10,335 --> 01:25:13,371
<i>Freddie Miller is a bad man.</i>

1435
01:25:13,405 --> 01:25:16,341
<i>Freddie Miller's a bad man.
Now, we got Trent Green down.</i>

1436
01:25:16,374 --> 01:25:18,845
<i>We've got Trent Green down
in the middle of the field.</i>

1437
01:25:18,878 --> 01:25:20,545
<i>This is not
the way I saw this.</i>

1438
01:25:21,914 --> 01:25:24,717
<i>And Green went
down hard and is not getting up.</i>

1439
01:25:25,651 --> 01:25:28,286
<i>And that looks bad.</i>

1440
01:25:28,320 --> 01:25:30,656
<i>...writhing in
pain, you do not wanna see this.</i>

1441
01:25:30,690 --> 01:25:32,591
<i>If you're the Rams,
or anybody, for that matter.</i>

1442
01:25:32,624 --> 01:25:35,828
<i>He was in a lot of
pain and you hate to see that</i>

1443
01:25:35,862 --> 01:25:37,697
<i>after a player gets you
by the knees from behind.</i>

1444
01:25:37,730 --> 01:25:38,998
Son of a...

1445
01:25:39,031 --> 01:25:41,433
<i>And Isaac Bruce is obviously
upset about it as well.</i>

1446
01:25:41,466 --> 01:25:43,502
<i>He should
have been penalized.</i>

1447
01:25:43,535 --> 01:25:46,706
<i>Kurt Warner, now warming up
on the sideline for the Rams.</i>

1448
01:25:46,739 --> 01:25:48,607
<i>Kurt Warner,
a capable back-up.</i>

1449
01:25:48,641 --> 01:25:49,541
Oh, my God.

1450
01:25:49,574 --> 01:25:51,576
<i>Certainly not where
Trent Green is.</i>

1451
01:25:51,610 --> 01:25:53,679
<i>To an exciting night
for us here at ESPN,</i>

1452
01:25:53,713 --> 01:25:54,881
<i>an exciting night
for the NFL.</i>

1453
01:25:54,914 --> 01:25:56,816
<i>So obviously,
lots of buzz coming out</i>

1454
01:25:56,849 --> 01:25:58,383
<i>this morning here
from Rams' camp</i>

1455
01:25:58,416 --> 01:26:00,019
<i>and the question today is
"Why not Kurt Warner?"</i>

1456
01:26:00,052 --> 01:26:01,788
<i>Why not Kurt
Warner? Really? You just said that?</i>

1457
01:26:01,821 --> 01:26:05,758
<i>Kurt Warner replaced
Trent Green as the starting quarterback.</i>

1458
01:26:05,792 --> 01:26:07,260
<i>This ain't the guy.</i>

1459
01:26:07,292 --> 01:26:10,963
<i>The Rams are gonna trade
for a quality starting quarterback.</i>

1460
01:26:10,997 --> 01:26:13,733
<i>They can't wait.
They've gotta do it right now.</i>

1461
01:26:13,766 --> 01:26:16,068
<i>If Dick
Vermeil stays with this guy,</i>

1462
01:26:16,102 --> 01:26:17,103
<i>he's gonna be a joke.</i>

1463
01:26:17,136 --> 01:26:19,071
<i>Their program is a joke.
The season's over.</i>

1464
01:26:22,074 --> 01:26:23,075
Come in.

1465
01:26:27,612 --> 01:26:29,715
- Sit down.
- Thank you, Coach, I prefer to stand.

1466
01:26:33,686 --> 01:26:36,321
All right. Go ahead, then.
Tell me.

1467
01:26:37,657 --> 01:26:38,691
Tell you what?

1468
01:26:38,724 --> 01:26:40,592
Why a team
worth $800 million

1469
01:26:40,626 --> 01:26:44,396
with one of the most complex
offenses ever built, by me,

1470
01:26:44,429 --> 01:26:45,530
should put you
in the driver's seat.

1471
01:26:48,701 --> 01:26:51,637
Because you threw some touchdowns
on a little football arena?

1472
01:26:51,671 --> 01:26:54,040
Hmm?

1473
01:26:54,073 --> 01:26:55,074
You're too old
to be a rookie.

1474
01:26:56,843 --> 01:26:58,878
You're too green to be a
pro, you don't belong here.

1475
01:27:00,146 --> 01:27:03,448
Well, with all due respect,
sir, you're wrong.

1476
01:27:03,481 --> 01:27:05,517
And if you give me a chance,
I will prove that to you.

1477
01:27:05,550 --> 01:27:06,786
Make us a laughingstock
of the league?

1478
01:27:06,819 --> 01:27:08,054
Embarrass every member
of this team,

1479
01:27:08,087 --> 01:27:10,455
- every fan of the city?
- That's not true.

1480
01:27:10,488 --> 01:27:11,991
You don't have
what it takes.

1481
01:27:12,024 --> 01:27:13,391
That's what
I believe.

1482
01:27:15,427 --> 01:27:17,697
So, why in the world would
I give you this shot?

1483
01:27:19,732 --> 01:27:21,767
Because this is
my time, sir.

1484
01:27:24,603 --> 01:27:27,139
Because I know who I am,
and I know why I'm here.

1485
01:27:29,474 --> 01:27:31,077
Because I've earned it.

1486
01:27:31,110 --> 01:27:33,378
I've waited for it,
I've bled for it. And...

1487
01:27:35,114 --> 01:27:38,150
I'm finally ready for it.
I wasn't before.

1488
01:27:38,184 --> 01:27:39,785
God knows I wasn't,
but I am now.

1489
01:27:41,988 --> 01:27:43,455
And I will not
let you down.

1490
01:27:45,925 --> 01:27:47,627
You put the ball
in my hands,

1491
01:27:48,995 --> 01:27:50,162
and we will win.

1492
01:27:53,065 --> 01:27:54,499
That's all, Kurt.

1493
01:28:21,027 --> 01:28:22,662
- Hello?
- <i>Hey, Coach.</i>

1494
01:28:24,864 --> 01:28:25,932
He's ready.

1495
01:28:32,705 --> 01:28:34,606
People asked me
last night

1496
01:28:34,640 --> 01:28:36,642
how I felt in that
press conference.

1497
01:28:39,011 --> 01:28:41,213
It hurts. I get emotional.

1498
01:28:42,848 --> 01:28:44,850
But that's what this
business is all about.

1499
01:28:49,922 --> 01:28:53,025
We will rally around
Kurt Warner.

1500
01:28:54,060 --> 01:28:56,696
And we will play
good football.

1501
01:29:07,605 --> 01:29:10,776
<i>CBS is proud to present
the National Football League.</i>

1502
01:29:10,810 --> 01:29:13,980
<i>Today, we come to you
from St. Louis, Missouri,</i>

1503
01:29:14,013 --> 01:29:15,848

What are you...
How did you get in here?

1512
01:30:02,194 --> 01:30:04,030
I, uh...

1513
01:30:04,063 --> 01:30:06,899
I needed you to hear this before
you went out on that field.

1514
01:30:08,701 --> 01:30:11,237
I was talking with our son,
and I helped him write it.

1515
01:30:13,739 --> 01:30:14,907
"To my daddy, Kurt.

1516
01:30:15,941 --> 01:30:18,677
"You fix all my radios.

"You play your football game.

"Love, Zack."

That little boy

1523
01:30:47,907 --> 01:30:49,809
has defied all odds.

1524
01:30:51,177 --> 01:30:52,178
Every time.

1525
01:30:53,345 --> 01:30:55,147
He's proven
everyone wrong.

1526
01:30:56,115 --> 01:30:57,582
And so will you.

1527
01:30:59,351 --> 01:31:01,353
You helped me
believe again.

1528
01:31:03,122 --> 01:31:05,391
That anything
can happen.

1529
01:31:05,424 --> 01:31:09,895
That maybe God does have
something amazing in store for us.

1530
01:31:10,996 --> 01:31:12,597
Maybe that
moment's now.

1531
01:31:17,203 --> 01:31:18,304
Are you nervous?

1532
01:31:22,675 --> 01:31:24,343
Yeah, I'm terrified.

1533
01:31:28,414 --> 01:31:29,782
Well, you go out there,

1534
01:31:31,050 --> 01:31:33,752
and you show the world
what I've known all along.

1535
01:32:09,755 --> 01:32:11,056
<i>Sell-out crowd.</i>

1536
01:32:11,090 --> 01:32:15,127
<i>Over 66,000 expected here
at the TWA Dome.</i>

1537
01:32:18,430 --> 01:32:20,799
<i>This is the
opportunity of a lifetime</i>

1538
01:32:20,833 --> 01:32:22,168
<i>for this young man.</i>

1539
01:32:22,201 --> 01:32:25,771
<i>A lot of pressure on
the shoulders of Number 13.</i>

1540
01:32:25,804 --> 01:32:27,306
<i>If he doesn't
perform well today,</i>

1541
01:32:27,339 --> 01:32:30,209
<i>the Cinderella story
could be over</i>

1542
01:32:30,242 --> 01:32:32,144
<i>before it even gets started.</i>

1543
01:32:34,346 --> 01:32:37,783
<i>The 1999 season underway...</i>

1544
01:32:37,816 --> 01:32:39,118
<i>It is on the end-zone...</i>

1545
01:32:43,789 --> 01:32:44,957
Ready for this, son?

1546
01:32:46,859 --> 01:32:48,928
Yes, sir.

1547
01:32:48,961 --> 01:32:52,264
<i>And the Rams with
their new quarterback,</i> Kurt Warner,

1548
01:32:52,298 --> 01:32:54,700
<i>replaced Trent Green
as the starting quarterback.</i>

1549
01:32:55,434 --> 01:32:57,136
Good, good.

1550
01:32:57,169 --> 01:33:00,172
<i>Take a look at the Ravens'
defensive lead, Ray Lewis is the All-Pro...</i>

1551
01:33:00,206 --> 01:33:02,441
All mine now, rook.
All mine.

1552
01:33:02,474 --> 01:33:05,444
All right, boys.

1553
01:33:05,477 --> 01:33:07,379
Launch left, 36 alpha.
On one. Ready!

1554
01:33:11,250 --> 01:33:12,284
Z-4-2!

1555
01:33:13,552 --> 01:33:15,487
Easy. I'm here, rook.
Hey, I'm here.

1556
01:33:16,555 --> 01:33:18,324
You get nothing.
This is my house.

1557
01:33:18,357 --> 01:33:20,192
My house!

1558
01:33:20,226 --> 01:33:21,994
<i>Now,
we're ready to get goin'.</i>

1559
01:33:22,027 --> 01:33:24,063
<i>First down and 10
for the Rams</i>

1560
01:33:24,096 --> 01:33:26,065
- <i>from the 42 yard line.</i>
- Blue 80! Hut!

1561
01:33:30,536 --> 01:33:31,804
Let's go!

1562
01:33:31,837 --> 01:33:33,906
<i>Faulk taken down
at the 40.</i>

1563
01:33:33,939 --> 01:33:35,774
<i>Ray Lewis got there...</i>

1564
01:33:35,808 --> 01:33:39,078
Let's go, let's go!
Let's go, let's go!

1565
01:33:39,111 --> 01:33:40,246
All right,
I'm ready.

1566
01:33:40,279 --> 01:33:41,413
I see you.
I see you.

1567
01:33:41,447 --> 01:33:43,215
I see you, rook.
I see you, rook.

1568
01:33:43,249 --> 01:33:45,517
Blue 80.
Blue 80, hut!

1569
01:33:49,154 --> 01:33:52,258
<i>And Warner ripped down
by, guess who? Ray Lewis.</i>

1570
01:33:52,291 --> 01:33:54,994
<i>It didn't take much of a guess for
those people who know Ray Lewis...</i>

1571
01:33:55,027 --> 01:33:56,528
This is just another game
of "Kill Kurt." Let's go.

1572
01:33:57,396 --> 01:33:59,898
Let's go! Let's go!

1573
01:33:59,932 --> 01:34:02,368
<i>They talked about
blitzing this young quarterback early.</i>

1574
01:34:02,401 --> 01:34:04,870
<i>Ray Lewis coming in
untouched.</i>

1575
01:34:04,903 --> 01:34:07,373
<i>The Rams need to give
Kurt Warner some time today</i>

1576
01:34:07,406 --> 01:34:09,141
- <i>for him to be able...</i>
- Ten for two!

1577
01:34:09,174 --> 01:34:11,343
- <i>...those weapons down field.</i>
- Black nine!

1578
01:34:12,578 --> 01:34:13,846
Black nine, hut!

1579
01:34:17,216 --> 01:34:19,385
<i>Warner
steps up in the pocket.</i>

1580
01:34:19,418 --> 01:34:20,886
<i>Caught! Isaac Bruce.</i>

1581
01:34:20,919 --> 01:34:22,121
Yes!

1582
01:34:22,154 --> 01:34:25,057
<i>At the front
and you love to see that...</i>

1583
01:34:25,090 --> 01:34:26,925
Hey! Yeah!

1584
01:34:26,959 --> 01:34:28,360
I taught him
that, now.

1585
01:34:28,394 --> 01:34:30,929
One-eighty!
One-eighty, hut!

1586
01:34:32,498 --> 01:34:33,565
<i>Warner...</i>

1587
01:34:38,170 --> 01:34:39,838
Let's go, huddle.
Hey, let's go, huddle.

1588
01:34:39,872 --> 01:34:41,140
Let's huddle.
Let's huddle right now.

1589
01:34:41,173 --> 01:34:42,408
Mike, what have
we got?

1590
01:34:42,441 --> 01:34:44,910
Right slot, fake 28,
power double seam.

1591
01:34:44,943 --> 01:34:46,412
- On one. Ready?
- Four-twenty-one. Ready?

1592
01:34:46,445 --> 01:34:48,180
Come on! Let's go, guys.
Let's go.

1593
01:34:48,213 --> 01:34:52,518
<i>And Kurt Warner, so far,
very nice job, stayin' within himself...</i>

1594
01:34:53,886 --> 01:34:55,921
52's the Mike.
52's the Mike.

1595
01:34:58,090 --> 01:34:59,191
52!

1596
01:35:03,395 --> 01:35:04,530
Green, 60, hut!

1597
01:35:06,165 --> 01:35:07,900
<i>Warner.</i>

1598
01:35:07,933 --> 01:35:10,235
<i>Intercepted by Ray Lewis.</i>

1599
01:35:10,269 --> 01:35:13,072
<i>And he's gotta beat the
quarterback down the sideline.</i>

1600
01:35:13,939 --> 01:35:14,907
<i>Cuts it in.</i>

1601
01:35:14,940 --> 01:35:17,976
<i>Lewis still running.</i>

1602
01:35:18,010 --> 01:35:21,880
<i>Ray Lewis all the way
down inside the 35.</i>

1603
01:35:21,914 --> 01:35:23,949
<i>Warner finally
makes a mistake.</i>

1604
01:35:23,982 --> 01:35:25,084
All day long, rook.

1605
01:35:25,117 --> 01:35:27,052
Eatin' you for lunch
all day long.

1606
01:35:35,127 --> 01:35:36,595
Shake that off.
You got this.

1607
01:35:38,330 --> 01:35:40,432
Hey, Warner,
Coach Martz wants to talk to you.

1608
01:35:47,707 --> 01:35:49,007
Yeah, Coach?

1609
01:35:49,041 --> 01:35:51,977
<i>Kurt, listen to me.
You know why I was so hard on you?</i>

1610
01:35:52,010 --> 01:35:54,179
<i>Why I put all that
pressure on you?</i>

1611
01:35:54,213 --> 01:35:56,382
<i>I had to know
that you were ready.</i>

1612
01:35:56,415 --> 01:35:57,549
Had to be sure.

1613
01:35:58,384 --> 01:35:59,385
And guess what?

1614
01:36:00,152 --> 01:36:02,020
You are.

1615
01:36:02,054 --> 01:36:03,956
<i>I never would've
put you on that field</i>

1616
01:36:03,989 --> 01:36:06,325
<i>if I didn't fully believe
you were a champion.</i>

1617
01:36:07,727 --> 01:36:10,963
Now, you get back out there
and you get this job done.

1618
01:36:10,996 --> 01:36:12,498
<i>Let's go.
Let's get after it.</i>

1619
01:36:12,531 --> 01:36:14,266
Yes, sir.
And, Coach?

1620
01:36:17,102 --> 01:36:18,537
Thank you.

1621
01:36:18,570 --> 01:36:20,640
<i>And the
Rams are in business.</i>

1622
01:36:20,673 --> 01:36:23,575
<i>A 34-yard return.</i>

1623
01:36:24,711 --> 01:36:26,445
Huddle.

1624
01:36:26,478 --> 01:36:29,081
Look at me.
You can do this.

1625
01:36:29,114 --> 01:36:30,416
I know you can.

1626
01:36:30,449 --> 01:36:33,419
Yeah. We got your back,
no matter what happens. Let's go to work.

1627
01:36:33,452 --> 01:36:34,319
Let's go to work.

1628
01:36:34,353 --> 01:36:36,522
All right.
That last one was on me.

1629
01:36:36,555 --> 01:36:38,157
But we got this.
Let's get to work.

1630
01:36:38,190 --> 01:36:41,460
Right doubles, grip, 50 sail.
On one, ready!

1631
01:36:45,097 --> 01:36:46,165
C-4 Rams!

1632
01:36:46,198 --> 01:36:48,600
You got this.

1633
01:36:48,635 --> 01:36:51,203
<i>And this young
man, Kurt Warner,</i>

1634
01:36:51,236 --> 01:36:53,572
<i>he played in the
Arena League in Iowa.</i>

1635
01:36:53,605 --> 01:36:54,973
Green, 60, hut!

1636
01:37:01,580 --> 01:37:02,581
That's it!

1637
01:37:04,183 --> 01:37:06,485
Let's give 'em a confidence play.
What do you say?

1638
01:37:06,518 --> 01:37:09,254
- <i>Get him settled in.</i>
- All right. Let's throw this at him.

1639
01:37:09,288 --> 01:37:10,322
Black, nine, hut!

1640
01:37:13,626 --> 01:37:15,194
<i>Throws to 10...</i>

1641
01:37:15,227 --> 01:37:17,129
<i>And it's Isaac Bruce.</i>

1642
01:37:17,162 --> 01:37:19,666
Here's the back. Right there, Kurt.

1643
01:37:19,699 --> 01:37:21,133
Good call,
good call!

1644
01:37:21,166 --> 01:37:24,169
<i>Warner, under
pressure, dances out of the pocket,</i>

1645
01:37:24,203 --> 01:37:25,772
<i>and...</i>

1646
01:37:25,805 --> 01:37:27,039
That's my boy!

1647
01:37:27,072 --> 01:37:30,275
<i>Look at that
composure from Kurt Warner.</i>

1648
01:37:30,309 --> 01:37:31,977
- Come on, Kurt!
- He's hot.

1649
01:37:37,349 --> 01:37:39,284
Watch it, watch it, watch it,
watch it, watch it, watch it.

1650
01:37:40,219 --> 01:37:42,722
Wide 20.
Wide 20, hut!

1651
01:37:46,291 --> 01:37:49,027
<i>Warner.
Corner of the end zone!</i>

1652
01:37:49,061 --> 01:37:50,128
<i>Roland Williams!</i>

1653
01:37:51,363 --> 01:37:52,264
<i>Touchdown!</i>

1654
01:37:56,268 --> 01:37:57,770
Yes!

1655
01:37:57,804 --> 01:38:01,708
<i>And Kurt Warner six
of ten 74 yards,</i>

1656
01:38:01,741 --> 01:38:03,710
<i>throws his first
NFL touchdown.</i>

1657
01:38:03,743 --> 01:38:05,010
See that?

1658
01:38:05,778 --> 01:38:07,179
I taught him that.

1659
01:38:07,212 --> 01:38:10,215
Come on, 1-3, show me some...
Have some faith.

1660
01:38:10,249 --> 01:38:12,351
<i>...their own 30-yard line.</i>

1661
01:38:12,384 --> 01:38:14,754
<i>Play-action,
Warner sets up tee...</i>

1662
01:38:14,787 --> 01:38:16,622
<i>Fires at the sidelines,</i>

1663
01:38:16,656 --> 01:38:19,057
<i>Isaac Bruce makes the catch...</i>

1664
01:38:28,367 --> 01:38:30,536
Oh, yeah!

1665
01:38:30,569 --> 01:38:32,170
Come on,
come on, come on.

1666
01:38:32,739 --> 01:38:33,806
Three, hut!

1667
01:38:36,608 --> 01:38:38,745
Look at Ray
Lewis chasing his tail.

1668
01:38:38,778 --> 01:38:40,847
Switch it! No.
Abort, abort, abort!

1669
01:38:40,880 --> 01:38:42,548
Oh, you're gonna love this.

1670
01:38:42,581 --> 01:38:43,650
Blue, 20, hut!

1671
01:38:45,517 --> 01:38:46,786
<i>Shovel pass.</i>

1672
01:38:46,819 --> 01:38:48,487
<i>Hakim.</i>

1673
01:38:48,520 --> 01:38:50,155
<i>Dodged.</i>

1674
01:38:50,188 --> 01:38:54,359
<i>When was the last time you saw shovel
pass to a wide receiver like that?</i>

1675
01:38:54,393 --> 01:38:55,762
This kid can play!

1676
01:38:55,795 --> 01:38:58,330
Three-fifty!
Three-fifty, hut!

1677
01:39:00,299 --> 01:39:02,802
<i>Warner again,
in the end zone...</i>

1678
01:39:02,835 --> 01:39:03,870
<i>Touchdown!</i>

1679
01:39:03,903 --> 01:39:05,772
<i>Well, Bruce!</i>

1680
01:39:05,805 --> 01:39:07,506
<i>Twenty yards.</i>

1681
01:39:09,141 --> 01:39:10,677
What a show!
What a show!

1682
01:39:10,710 --> 01:39:15,380
<i>I have never been so
happy to have been proven so wrong.</i>

1683
01:39:15,414 --> 01:39:17,616
<i>I mean, you're watching
a star being born.</i>

1684
01:39:17,650 --> 01:39:19,551
<i>This is a day
that we will not forget.</i>

1685
01:39:19,585 --> 01:39:22,055
<i>Ravens falling
apart offensively right now.</i>

1686
01:39:22,755 --> 01:39:25,123
- Wow.
- <i>Mitchell.</i>

1687
01:39:25,157 --> 01:39:27,125
Come on. Pump fake. All right.

1688
01:39:27,159 --> 01:39:29,127
<i>Intercepted!</i>

1689
01:39:31,831 --> 01:39:33,633
<i>Huge. Running down the clock,</i>

1690
01:39:33,666 --> 01:39:37,502
<i>there's only four and a half
minutes left in this game.</i>

1691
01:39:37,536 --> 01:39:40,339
- Four more minutes, baby.
- I don't want this game to end, gentlemen.

1692
01:39:40,372 --> 01:39:43,375
Hey, left, cross, split,
50-F, follow on one, ready!

1693
01:39:44,877 --> 01:39:47,212
<i>Kurt Warner.
And he throws.</i>

1694
01:39:47,245 --> 01:39:49,548
<i>Marshall Faulk
out of the back field.</i>

1695
01:39:49,581 --> 01:39:51,583
<i>And there he goes.
Look at this.</i>

1696
01:39:51,617 --> 01:39:55,855
<i>Making people miss
inside the 21-yard line.</i>

1697
01:39:56,889 --> 01:39:58,423
We got 'em
on the ropes!

1698
01:39:58,457 --> 01:40:00,627
We're gonna punch
this in, right now.

1699
01:40:00,660 --> 01:40:02,795
Left, close,
red, X, laser.

1700
01:40:02,829 --> 01:40:04,864
On one, ready.

1701
01:40:04,897 --> 01:40:07,599
<i>And Kurt
Warner, he's confident.</i>

1702
01:40:07,634 --> 01:40:10,335
<i>Because he certainly
has something to prove.</i>

1703
01:40:11,303 --> 01:40:12,639
Blue 80, hut!

1704
01:40:26,284 --> 01:40:27,285
Perfect.

1705
01:40:29,588 --> 01:40:31,958
<i>Great catch!</i>

1706
01:40:31,991 --> 01:40:35,594
<i>Touchdown! The rookie!</i>

1707
01:40:36,294 --> 01:40:37,830
<i>Yeah!</i>

1708
01:40:37,864 --> 01:40:42,735
<i>And what a job
by that young man there.</i>

1709
01:40:47,239 --> 01:40:50,710
<i>Kurt Warner is like
Magic Johnson today.</i>

1710
01:40:50,743 --> 01:40:52,477
<i>Look at all the assists.</i>

1711
01:40:52,511 --> 01:40:53,545
You got it done.

1712
01:40:54,379 --> 01:40:55,948
<i>He's partying right now.</i>

1713
01:40:55,982 --> 01:41:00,452
<i>That's because the Rams gave complete
control of this football game...</i>

1714
01:41:03,355 --> 01:41:07,526
Warner! Warner! Warner!

1715
01:41:08,928 --> 01:41:10,529
<i>Dick Vermeil.</i>

1716
01:41:10,562 --> 01:41:14,767
<i>The old coach has to smile</i> after this
one because they're happy in St. Louis.

1717
01:41:16,035 --> 01:41:19,504
<i>And that should do it.
One more kneel-down by the Rams.</i>

1718
01:41:19,538 --> 01:41:21,440
<i>And the first win
is in the books.</i>

1719
01:41:22,008 --> 01:41:23,408
My gosh.

1720
01:41:48,400 --> 01:41:49,568
Blue, 80, hut!

1721
01:41:53,072 --> 01:41:54,439
Thank you.

1722
01:41:57,944 --> 01:41:59,344
Thank you.

1723
01:42:08,921 --> 01:42:11,356
Look at him!

1724
01:42:11,389 --> 01:42:13,492
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout,
that's my guy!

1725
01:42:14,093 --> 01:42:15,828
We did it!
We did it.

1726
01:42:15,862 --> 01:42:18,396
Man, you keep that game ball.
You earned it.

1727
01:42:18,430 --> 01:42:19,431
I will.

1728
01:42:19,932 --> 01:42:21,000
Kurt!

1729
01:42:22,802 --> 01:42:24,871
Kurt! Kurt!
Hey, good game, bro.

1730
01:42:24,904 --> 01:42:26,839
Hey, that means a heck
of a lot comin' from you.

1731
01:42:26,873 --> 01:42:28,340
- No problem.
- It really does.

1732
01:42:29,407 --> 01:42:30,575
Brenda!

1733
01:42:32,044 --> 01:42:33,946
Great game, boys.
Great game, boys.

1734
01:42:37,482 --> 01:42:39,719
Well done.
It was a beautiful thing to watch.

1735
01:42:39,752 --> 01:42:41,620
- Thank you for believing in me, Coach.
- Well done.

1736
01:42:41,654 --> 01:42:42,989
Thank you.
Brenda!

1737
01:42:45,057 --> 01:42:47,592
Hey! Baby. Hey.

1738
01:42:52,865 --> 01:42:54,667
Hey, I don't know
where we go from here,

1739
01:42:54,700 --> 01:42:56,401
I don't know what comes next.
But this?

1740
01:42:58,070 --> 01:42:59,437
We did this.

1741
01:43:00,273 --> 01:43:02,340
We did this together.
I love you.

1742
01:43:02,374 --> 01:43:04,543
I love you, too.
We did it!

1743
01:43:06,444 --> 01:43:07,379
One-eighty!

1744
01:43:07,412 --> 01:43:09,481
<i>Kurt Warner has brought hope</i>

1745
01:43:09,514 --> 01:43:10,850
<i>back to St. Louis.</i>

1746
01:43:10,883 --> 01:43:13,418
<i>The first quarterback
in the history of the NFL</i>

1747
01:43:13,451 --> 01:43:16,621
<i>to throw three touchdown passes
in each of his first three starts.</i>

1748
01:43:16,656 --> 01:43:17,857
<i>Here they come again.</i>

1749
01:43:17,890 --> 01:43:19,424
<i>Forget Ringling Brothers.</i>

1750
01:43:19,457 --> 01:43:21,426
<i>The Rams are the
greatest show on Earth.</i>

1751
01:43:21,459 --> 01:43:23,629
<i>Kurt Warner,
out of the Arena League</i>

1752
01:43:23,663 --> 01:43:26,699
<i>and as a back-up when the season
began, became the league's MVP.</i>

1753
01:43:26,732 --> 01:43:28,835
<i>A phenomenal
and unbelievable story.</i>

1754
01:43:28,868 --> 01:43:30,602
<i>Just
remember, this guy here,</i>

1755
01:43:30,636 --> 01:43:33,605
<i>he was bagging groceries
at the Hy-Vee five years ago.</i>

1756
01:43:33,639 --> 01:43:35,741
<i>So, he goes from
the Hy-Vee to the MVP.</i>

1757
01:43:35,775 --> 01:43:37,877
<i>The best human-interest story
in sports in years.</i>

1758
01:43:37,910 --> 01:43:40,813
<i>All aboard St.
Louis, this train is now...</i>

1759
01:43:44,549 --> 01:43:46,585
<i>You couldn't ask
for a better script.</i>

1760
01:43:46,618 --> 01:43:48,386
Let's go win this
thing right now.

1761
01:43:48,420 --> 01:43:49,621
Let's win it right now. Come on!

1762
01:43:49,655 --> 01:43:51,924
<i>The MVP
of the league, Kurt Warner,</i>

1763
01:43:51,958 --> 01:43:55,695
<i>comes into a situation
that every kid dreams of, Al.</i>

1764
01:43:55,728 --> 01:43:59,665
<i>Two minutes to go in the Super
Bowl, your team is tied.</i>

1765
01:43:59,699 --> 01:44:03,501
<i>I can't tell you how many
times I relived this as a kid.</i>

1766
01:44:22,922 --> 01:44:24,857
<i>Going deep downfield,</i>

1767
01:44:24,891 --> 01:44:27,459
<i>adjusting for it
is Isaac Bruce.</i>

1768
01:44:27,492 --> 01:44:31,864
<i>And Isaac Bruce threads
his way for a touchdown!</i>

1769
01:44:33,598 --> 01:44:35,701
<i>Seventy-three yards.</i>

1770
01:44:39,604 --> 01:44:42,909
<i>You couldn't have written a better
script for the MVP of the league.</i>

1771
01:44:42,942 --> 01:44:46,812
<i>He throws a beautiful pass
in the face of pressure.</i>

1772
01:44:53,019 --> 01:44:56,956
<i>And the Rams have won
the Super Bowl.</i>

1773
01:44:56,989 --> 01:45:01,526
<i>Go on, the game is over.
The game is over.</i>

1774
01:45:13,973 --> 01:45:16,108
<i>Kurt Warner.</i>

1775
01:45:16,142 --> 01:45:18,576
<i>First things first.
Five years ago,</i>

1776
01:45:18,610 --> 01:45:21,180
<i>you were stocking
supermarket shelves in Iowa.</i>

1777
01:45:21,213 --> 01:45:23,115
<i>Now, you're
a Super Bowl champion,</i>

1778
01:45:23,149 --> 01:45:26,484
<i>an NFL MVP,
a Super Bowl MVP.</i>

1779
01:45:26,518 --> 01:45:28,187
<i>What message does it
send to people?</i>

1780
01:45:28,220 --> 01:45:30,588
<i>I thank all the players,
all the coaches,</i>

1781
01:45:30,622 --> 01:45:33,259
<i>my family, everybody,
for believin' in me</i>

1782
01:45:33,292 --> 01:45:35,695
<i>and I gotta give
the praise and glory</i>

1783
01:45:35,728 --> 01:45:37,630
<i>to my Lord and savior
up above.</i>

1784
01:45:37,663 --> 01:45:40,232
<i>Now we're world champions,
how about that, Rams?</i>

1785
01:51:17,202 --> 01:51:18,904
Zachary.

1786
01:51:21,874 --> 01:51:23,509
Brenda.

1787
01:51:23,542 --> 01:51:25,311
Kurt Warner
has a little boy.

1788
01:51:30,416 --> 01:51:33,118
It's not a complete circle,
because this is open.

1789
01:51:33,152 --> 01:51:34,887
- So it's a big hook.
- Yeah.

1790
01:51:34,920 --> 01:51:35,954
It starts here.

1791
01:51:35,988 --> 01:51:39,358
And then it comes around
so that is a heart.

1792
01:51:39,391 --> 01:51:40,459
<i>Heart.</i>
